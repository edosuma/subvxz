♪ ♪

00:20.246 --> 00:22.670
Louise, your breakfast
is getting cold.

00:22.839 --> 00:23.838
It's just cereal.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.006
It's supposed to be cold.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.025
Or have I been doing it wrong?

00:26.176 --> 00:27.918
I was gonna make cheesy eggs

00:28.011 --> 00:29.086
for everybody this morning,

00:29.104 --> 00:30.845
but someone ate the entire

00:30.939 --> 00:32.089
brand-new block of cheddar.

00:32.107 --> 00:33.515
It was sharp cheddar,

00:33.609 --> 00:35.701
which is the best-dressed
of all the cheddars.

00:35.928 --> 00:37.519
-That's true.
-(yawns)

00:37.538 --> 00:39.596
Morning, Louise. You seem tired.

00:39.615 --> 00:41.948
Why you so sleepy, honey?
Did you have a bad dream

00:42.101 --> 00:44.101
where your father goes crazy
and kills the whole family?

00:44.194 --> 00:45.693
-What?
-No, nothing cool like that.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.380
It's just tomorrow
is my last show-and-tell ever.

00:48.532 --> 00:50.607
-Ever.
-Oh, right, it stops
after fourth grade.

00:50.626 --> 00:52.700
But then in fifth grade
you get social studies,

00:52.795 --> 00:54.369
-so that's cool.
-Anyway,

00:54.463 --> 00:56.296
I'm kind of the rock star
of show-and-tell.

00:56.448 --> 00:58.223
It's my thing,
it's what I'm known for.

00:58.450 --> 00:59.966
-Everyone agrees.
-That and your dainty feet.

01:00.119 --> 01:01.209
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

01:01.287 --> 01:02.877
I've always knocked it
out of the park,

01:02.897 --> 01:04.121
and this is my last one,

01:04.123 --> 01:05.305
I really have to bring it.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.215
So I was up all night
trying to figure out

01:07.234 --> 01:09.126
what to do for my last hurrah

01:09.144 --> 01:10.736
and I came up with nothing!

01:10.963 --> 01:13.297
Well, why don't you bring
one of your fun Japanese toys?

01:13.465 --> 01:15.074
That octopus-looking one, maybe?

01:15.301 --> 01:16.483
He's got a story to tell, I bet.

01:16.635 --> 01:18.151
Or at least a funny thing
that happened to him

01:18.320 --> 01:19.486
in the checkout line
at the grocery store?

01:19.638 --> 01:22.081
Oh, Tina, Tina, Tina.
You really don't get it.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.398
I've set a very high bar.

01:23.492 --> 01:25.475
My completely mechanical
replacement arm

01:25.494 --> 01:28.236
has ten times the strength
of a normal arm.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.130
This is a drawing
of my pet monkey, Bjorn.

01:30.316 --> 01:31.498
Couple things about Bjorn--

01:31.575 --> 01:32.332
he can do the Macarena,

01:32.426 --> 01:34.167
he is an ordained minister...

01:34.261 --> 01:36.095
This is a tooth from
the shark that tried to eat me,

01:36.322 --> 01:38.097
and I kickboxed my way
out of its mouth.

01:38.248 --> 01:39.172
We're actually good friends now.

01:39.249 --> 01:41.082
It's made with human remains

01:41.102 --> 01:42.542
from the crematorium next door.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.436
Louise, I think maybe
some of your show-and-tells

01:44.663 --> 01:48.089
weren't exactly honest.
Because they were lies.

01:48.183 --> 01:50.000
For your last one,
maybe you do something real.

01:50.002 --> 01:52.427
What? No. Real life is boring.

01:52.521 --> 01:55.096
Just look at Dad over there,
reading the newspaper.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.356
-Boring.
-Hey.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.375
You think people
want to hear about that life?

01:58.377 --> 02:00.268
This actually
isn't boring, Louise.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.361
I'm reading about that old

02:01.455 --> 02:03.104
artillery battery
near the wharf.

02:03.198 --> 02:04.514
It says some cannonballs
washed ashore.

02:04.533 --> 02:06.774
Speaking of cannonballs
washing ashore,

02:06.794 --> 02:07.868
I got to go to the bathroom.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.277
Thank you for that, Gene.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.629
There was an artillery battery
around here?

02:10.780 --> 02:13.023
And what kind of batteries
do artilleries take?

02:13.041 --> 02:14.133
Double-A?
It's always double-A.

02:14.284 --> 02:16.543
A battery is a bunch of cannons,
I think.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.046
They used them
in the War of 1812 against

02:20.199 --> 02:21.306
the bad guys?

02:21.533 --> 02:23.142
You know the spot,
there's a cannon there.

02:23.369 --> 02:24.643
Or a statue of a cannon.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.979
We maybe let you play on it
when you were little,

02:27.130 --> 02:29.039
which I assume was okay.

02:29.057 --> 02:30.632
Our town should get playgrounds.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.800
So, yeah, after that
big storm last month,

02:32.895 --> 02:35.136
these old cannonballs washed up
on the beach near the battery,

02:35.230 --> 02:36.396
which is pretty cool.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.381
Oh, that storm.

02:37.399 --> 02:38.973
I had to reset all the clocks.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.384
And I didn't check
what time it was,

02:40.402 --> 02:41.326
so don't use the clocks

02:41.553 --> 02:42.903
if you need to know
what time it is.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.329
Yes, that's it!

02:44.556 --> 02:46.072
I'm gonna go
look for a cannonball.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.167
That's a real thing,
right, Tina?

02:48.318 --> 02:49.409
Uh, wait.
what?

02:49.561 --> 02:51.486
No one is gonna
go look for a cannonball.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.413
I don't want any of my babies
getting exploded.

02:53.565 --> 02:56.491
Well, the cannonballs themselves
don't explode, Lin.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.678
They're just a ball of iron.
The gunpowder was in the cannon.

02:59.905 --> 03:01.513
Unless that's their evil plan.

03:01.665 --> 03:04.683
To blow us up a hundred and
something years after the war?

03:04.910 --> 03:06.018
I don't know.

03:06.245 --> 03:07.577
Eh, it was a false alarm.

03:07.671 --> 03:09.429
But still give
it a few minutes in there.

03:09.581 --> 03:11.081
Lot of smoke but no fire.
What'd I miss?

03:11.099 --> 03:13.841
I'm gonna look for cannonballs
on the beach after breakfast.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.027
-Who's in?
-Sounds fun,

03:15.178 --> 03:16.436
but I don't think
I should go anywhere.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.513
I'd feel better
if I could lose this cheddar.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.106
Tina, what about you?
You coming?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.441
I mean,
I'll go to the beach with you

03:21.518 --> 03:22.534
because that sounds nice,

03:22.778 --> 03:24.203
but I don't think
we'll find any cannonballs.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.520
We may find
a pleasant breeze, though.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.522
Aw, a sister cannonball run.

03:27.616 --> 03:29.783
You know, when I was a kid,
we found a box of bullets

03:29.935 --> 03:31.192
in the woods and threw 'em
at each other.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.360
But don't do that.
And, hey,

03:32.379 --> 03:33.712
stay on the beach, you two.

03:33.863 --> 03:35.105
No going on slippery rocks

03:35.123 --> 03:36.122
where the waves
can knock you in.

03:36.217 --> 03:37.624
And there's some
caves near there.

03:37.776 --> 03:38.700
Don't go in those.

03:38.794 --> 03:40.201
Because of drowning.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.946
And if we see a volcano,
should we jump in that or no?

03:42.965 --> 03:44.223
No. No volcanos.

03:44.374 --> 03:46.450
They seem fun but they're not.

03:46.468 --> 03:49.210
So, Bob, you know how Kathleen
likes to watch hurling?

03:49.304 --> 03:51.212
-Uh, no.
-Well, she does. A lot.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.898
She likes watching people vomit?

03:53.049 --> 03:54.791
-Hurling is a sport, Gene.
-Sports?

03:54.884 --> 03:56.293
Ugh, I'd rather
watch people vomit.

03:56.462 --> 03:57.477
It's like hockey but on grass.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.554
And they have a ball
instead of a puck

03:59.573 --> 04:02.799
and then you can
pick up the ball, I think.

04:02.818 --> 04:04.910
It's a little confusing.
But, uh, I love it.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.411
Sounds like you do.

04:06.563 --> 04:07.988
Uh, yeah, anyway, the bar where

04:08.082 --> 04:09.397
she usually watches it
is closing.

04:09.475 --> 04:10.991
The owner's
moving back to Ireland,

04:11.085 --> 04:12.567
-to start an American bar.
-Okay.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.921
So, I kind of invited her here
to watch the game today.

04:16.148 --> 04:17.905
But is it even on regular TV?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.666
No, uh, but I have a computer

04:19.835 --> 04:21.318
and a little projector
in my truck.

04:21.336 --> 04:23.487
And I can rig it all up.
Doesn't that sound fun?

04:23.580 --> 04:24.488
I guess.

04:24.581 --> 04:26.506
Aw, Teddy,
look at you rigging up

04:26.658 --> 04:28.433
sports stuff
for your special friend.

04:28.585 --> 04:30.176
Some hurlin' and girlin'.
But she's a woman.

04:30.271 --> 04:32.012
Yeah, well,
Kathleen likes hurling,

04:32.164 --> 04:33.497
so I'm gonna like hurling.
Because

04:33.515 --> 04:35.590
it's good to have,
you know, shared hobbies.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.609
My ex-wife Denise and I
had nothing in common.

04:37.761 --> 04:39.686
Her favorite thing
was going on trips by herself

04:39.838 --> 04:41.947
and not telling me
when or where she was going,

04:42.098 --> 04:43.431
and mine was just
sitting at home,

04:43.450 --> 04:45.008
rocking back and forth a little,

04:45.177 --> 04:46.267
and saying,
"We're still in love."

04:46.361 --> 04:48.011
(chuckles)
Over and over.

04:48.180 --> 04:49.604
-Aw, Teddy.
-Look at you two.

04:49.698 --> 04:52.607
You share some hobbies.
You both like burgers and fries.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.294
Hurling could be me and
Kathleen's "burgers and fries."

04:55.445 --> 04:57.111
I mean, not a hobby, but...

04:57.205 --> 04:59.372
-Anyway, great. We're doing it.
-Yes!

04:59.525 --> 05:01.207
It's happening!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

05:01.302 --> 05:03.135
Thank you, Gene.
That's very supportive.

05:03.244 --> 05:05.045
Uh, Teddy,
I think he's talking about

05:05.121 --> 05:06.196
-going to the bathroom.
-Oh.

05:06.214 --> 05:08.048
Wait.
Nope, not happening.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.457
Dang it.
What's wrong with me?

05:09.476 --> 05:12.052
This is where I shine.
This is who I am!

05:12.204 --> 05:13.961
Aw, my poor blocked-up baby.

05:14.056 --> 05:15.296
I'm gonna beat this.
They're gonna make

05:15.316 --> 05:16.982
an independent movie
about it someday.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.300
LOUISE: Well, that's
the cannon up there.

05:19.394 --> 05:20.802
We're definitely looking
in the right place.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.062
Where are the cannonballs?

05:22.156 --> 05:23.304
I mean, people probably
found them all?

05:23.398 --> 05:24.489
Oh, look, there's something.

05:24.566 --> 05:27.067
Oh. No, just
part of a dead crab.

05:27.219 --> 05:28.810
But it's kind of cool.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.828
Could work for show-and-tell?

05:29.979 --> 05:31.071
Aah! The legs moved.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.314
You're gonna be fine,
little guy. Heh.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.149
Let's keep going.
He's not gonna be fine.

05:35.243 --> 05:36.818
Yeah, besides, I can't
walk into show-and-tell

05:36.986 --> 05:38.503
with half a dead crab, Tina.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.081
I'd get laughed out of there.
I'd get booed.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.323
Wait, people boo
at show-and-tell?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.158
I mean, Ms. Labonz
boos sometimes.

05:44.236 --> 05:45.251
-Harsh.
-Yeah.

05:45.404 --> 05:47.737
-Hey, there's Gus.
-Hi, Gus.

05:47.756 --> 05:48.905
Hello, kids.

05:48.998 --> 05:49.906
You haven't
caught any cannonballs

05:49.999 --> 05:51.016
with that thing, have you?

05:51.167 --> 05:52.425
Nope, just trying
to catch my dinner.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.019
Well, I hope you
reel in a pizza then.

05:54.246 --> 05:55.503
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.597
I know pizzas
don't live in the ocean.

05:57.749 --> 05:59.916
You know, there were cannons
all along the bluff up there.

05:59.935 --> 06:01.175
They went past the point.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.419
If I was looking
for a cannonball,

06:02.512 --> 06:04.029
I'd look over there
in the rocks.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.106
Not as many people
walking around over there.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.941
It's a little harder to get to.

06:08.093 --> 06:10.093
Or I'd look in the caves
beyond the point

06:10.112 --> 06:11.611
-if it wasn't so dangerous.
-Interesting.

06:11.763 --> 06:14.355
Another reason people don't go
there is it gets pretty stinky.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.524
-How stinky we talking?
-Pretty nasty.

06:16.618 --> 06:20.027
It comes from a seaweed that
gets washed up called sargassum.

06:20.122 --> 06:21.605
Smells like rotten eggs.

06:21.623 --> 06:24.274
I got some in my boat
in 1986 and it still smells.

06:24.292 --> 06:27.277
Not that my boat smelled great
before that, but still.

06:27.295 --> 06:28.387
-Thanks, Gus.
-You're welcome.

06:28.538 --> 06:30.222
Looks like we're
going on those rocks.

06:30.373 --> 06:32.391
What? But Mom said
no going on the rocks.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.451
And if we don't
find anything there,

06:34.469 --> 06:35.877
-we're looking in the caves.
-Dad said no caves!

06:35.896 --> 06:38.972
Tina, that was before we got
all the hot tips from Gus.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.399
The hot Gus goss.

06:40.550 --> 06:42.216
It's obviously where
the cannonballs are gonna be.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.069
And look-- the tide's going out.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.311
It's perfectly safe.

06:45.464 --> 06:47.464
Oh, also, the tide's coming in,

06:47.482 --> 06:49.616
so you definitely don't
want to go in the caves now.

06:49.726 --> 06:52.302
Unless you like drowning.
Most people don't.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.395
(muffled): So be careful
looking around over there.

06:54.415 --> 06:55.655
-What did he say?
-I don't know.

06:55.807 --> 06:57.657
-I think he caught a fish.
-Oh. Way to go, Gus.

06:57.809 --> 07:00.419
-(muffled): Okay, then.
-See Tina? Everything's great.

07:00.570 --> 07:03.070
Gus caught his dinner
and I'm gonna be the winner.

07:03.165 --> 07:05.674
-Of show-and-tell.
That's the spirit.
-Aah, aah, aah, aah, aah!

07:09.412 --> 07:11.671
No cannonball there.
No cannonball there.

07:11.823 --> 07:13.339
Whoa.
Tina, you see anything?

07:13.492 --> 07:15.416
No, I'm kind of more
focused on not falling off

07:15.510 --> 07:17.510
these very slippery rocks
we're not supposed to be on

07:17.663 --> 07:19.512
and being taken away
by the ocean.

07:19.665 --> 07:22.757
Oof, now I smell the seaweed
Gus was talking about.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.109
Oh, yeah, the sargassum.

07:24.260 --> 07:25.593
Are you being "sargasstic?"
Ha!

07:25.612 --> 07:27.779
Look at the not-dangerous fun
we're having.

07:27.931 --> 07:29.522
Uh-huh, totally.
Hey,

07:29.675 --> 07:31.191
I know I'm the one who said
you should do something real

07:31.343 --> 07:33.009
for show-and-tell,
but there's lots of real things

07:33.102 --> 07:35.528
-we can find that aren't near
smelly, dangerous rocks.
-Tina,

07:35.681 --> 07:39.199
this is my final show-and-tell.
This has to be spectacular.

07:39.351 --> 07:42.519
I want people to say,
"Just being near Louise Belcher

07:42.537 --> 07:43.870
"gives my life meaning.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.023
Praise Louise Belcher.
Praise Louise Belcher."

07:47.042 --> 07:48.633
Oh! I don't like
when it does that.

07:48.860 --> 07:51.285
Well, maybe it doesn't like
when you're so negative.

07:51.379 --> 07:52.712
Yup, yup.
Sorry, ocean.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.382
LINDA:
Uh, the screen seems like
it might be, uh...

07:56.535 --> 07:58.477
BOB:
Incredibly inconvenient?

07:58.628 --> 08:01.629
No, I was gonna say,
"a fun obstacle."

08:01.648 --> 08:03.223
BOB:
Why not just put
the screen on the back wall?

08:03.317 --> 08:04.390
'Cause of the booths, Bob.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.151
If the screen's
on the back wall,

08:06.378 --> 08:07.635
the people facing the door
can't see it.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.380
This way everyone just
has to turn their head.

08:10.398 --> 08:11.323
Yeah, people like
watching things

08:11.399 --> 08:12.807
that are to the side of them.

08:12.901 --> 08:14.234
It's like, "Hey, you."

08:14.386 --> 08:15.810
-Teddy...
-Bob, it's fine.

08:15.979 --> 08:17.070
It's just one day.

08:17.222 --> 08:18.388
And it's just
one piece of paper.

08:18.481 --> 08:19.647
BOB:
And also all of that.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.059
Right. So you had
all these printed, Teddy?

08:23.152 --> 08:24.169
Well, I had to.
You'd be surprised

08:24.320 --> 08:26.396
how few stores there are
that sell posters

08:26.489 --> 08:28.173
with motivational
hurling phrases on them.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.250
What does
"shorten the grip" mean?

08:30.344 --> 08:32.085
I'm not exactly sure.
I just went online

08:32.179 --> 08:33.512
and looked up hurling phrases.

08:33.663 --> 08:34.587
Very smart.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.406
"Three cheers
for crisp striking."

08:36.499 --> 08:39.075
I kind of made up the
"three cheers" part of that one.

08:39.094 --> 08:40.167
It's good.

08:40.262 --> 08:41.578
Kathleen is gonna love it.

08:41.596 --> 08:43.355
Well, hopefully the other
guys will like it, too.

08:43.582 --> 08:45.172
-Other guys?
-Yeah, I found a local

08:45.267 --> 08:46.691
hurling enthusiast club online.

08:46.918 --> 08:48.360
-I invited them all.
-Y-You did?

08:48.511 --> 08:51.087
Yeah, you can't watch an
exciting live sporting event

08:51.106 --> 08:52.346
in a quiet restaurant.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.090
-Not that quiet.
-Pretty quiet.

08:54.109 --> 08:55.516
Yeah, you can
hear Bob breathing.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.943
-Really? You can?
-Yeah, it's nice.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.278
-It's loud.
-I can tell you're alive

08:58.430 --> 08:59.538
when you're back in the kitchen.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.264
-I don't have to check on you.
-BOB: Mm.

09:01.357 --> 09:03.357
Well, sounds like
we may have a busy day.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.544
-That's good.
-Yeah, I guess it is.

09:05.695 --> 09:07.528
-The online group
is just three people.
-BOB: Oh.

09:07.697 --> 09:09.864
Should we put this up here
or should we put it outside?

09:09.958 --> 09:10.957
What's a good spot?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.552
♪<i> Oh, my old Irish Rose.</i> ♪

09:13.703 --> 09:15.887
It's not a real song, Bobby.
I made it up.

09:16.039 --> 09:17.204
You thought it was a real song.

09:17.299 --> 09:18.539
It's not,
it just sounds like one.

09:18.633 --> 09:22.710
Okay. Cool cave.
But it doesn't smell great.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.137
Huh, let's look.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.230
Nope, don't see
any cannonballs in there.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.806
Oh, well, we tried.
Guess we go back,

09:26.958 --> 09:28.215
see if that interesting

09:28.310 --> 09:28.900
half-crab is still
hanging around?

09:29.127 --> 09:29.734
Tina, I'm going in.

09:29.961 --> 09:31.218
But Dad said no.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.796
And you know what's fun?
Listening to your parents

09:32.814 --> 09:34.072
and remaining alive.

09:34.299 --> 09:36.575
It's fine, I can just
go in there by myself.

09:36.726 --> 09:39.319
No need for you to feel guilty
or responsible for my fate.

09:39.471 --> 09:41.246
Just because you're my
big sister and my protector

09:41.397 --> 09:43.230
and finding something real
and true was all your idea.

09:43.325 --> 09:45.475
But are we sure
the tide is going out?

09:45.568 --> 09:47.493
Looks like it
might be coming in?

09:47.646 --> 09:50.330
Tina, I've lived by the sea
for over nine years now.

09:50.498 --> 09:53.240
I think I know a thing
or two about the tides, m'kay?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.408
Uh...

09:54.428 --> 09:56.319
Oh, uh-oh, look--
oh, I'm in.

09:56.412 --> 09:57.987
Ah, see how easy it is to go in?

09:58.081 --> 10:00.765
-Look how "in" I am.
-Ugh. Fine.

10:01.827 --> 10:03.101
Whoa. (gags)

10:03.328 --> 10:05.586
Right? The smell
is another thing

10:05.680 --> 10:07.180
that keeps away the looky-loos.

10:07.332 --> 10:08.681
But not us,
because we've been training

10:08.834 --> 10:10.442
our whole lives for this
by living with Gene.

10:10.669 --> 10:14.428
Now, come on.
Let's go find mama a cannonball!

10:14.448 --> 10:15.505
You guys good?

10:15.598 --> 10:17.357
(Irish accent):
We're good. Cheers.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.100
Isn't this place great?
Good banners, huh?

10:19.194 --> 10:20.510
Such good phrases.

10:20.528 --> 10:23.104
So, uh... who are you guys
rooting for today?

10:23.198 --> 10:24.289
Waterford or Tipperary?

10:24.516 --> 10:26.107
Can't you tell
by what we're wearing?

10:26.201 --> 10:28.201
It's obviously Waterfor...

10:28.295 --> 10:30.203
-Tipperary.
-Of course. (laughs)

10:30.297 --> 10:32.279
'Cause those are the colors
that Tipperary wears.

10:32.374 --> 10:33.706
This guy didn't know that,

10:33.800 --> 10:34.874
-but I do.
-What?

10:35.026 --> 10:36.042
What can I get
you hurly-burlies?

10:36.194 --> 10:37.861
Burger of the day
for me, please.

10:37.863 --> 10:38.862
-Same.
-Me as well.

10:38.955 --> 10:40.121
And three beers, thanks.

10:40.289 --> 10:41.531
I'll put that order in
for you gentlemen,

10:41.549 --> 10:42.882
and now, if you'll excuse me,

10:43.034 --> 10:44.625
I'm gonna go see
if can tickle the ivory.

10:44.719 --> 10:46.719
I'm assuming that's
what toilets are made of.

10:46.872 --> 10:47.871
-Wish me luck.
-Gene.

10:47.889 --> 10:48.872
Go get 'em, honey.

10:48.890 --> 10:51.040
Okay, not loving this.

10:51.134 --> 10:52.800
Not loving this at all.

10:52.894 --> 10:55.320
Everything in my body
is telling me we should leave.

10:55.547 --> 10:57.138
Mostly my nose,
because of the smell.

10:57.232 --> 10:59.883
Oh, and yup, that's more water.

10:59.901 --> 11:01.217
Huh.
That's more water!

11:01.219 --> 11:02.719
-Louise!
-Yeah?

11:02.888 --> 11:03.811
Cool update.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.904
The tide is coming in.

11:05.056 --> 11:06.981
Well, that's odd.
And kind of rude.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.667
But even if it is
just now coming in,

11:08.894 --> 11:10.226
we have plenty of time.

11:10.245 --> 11:11.485
Come help me look over here.

11:11.505 --> 11:14.247
If I was a cannonball,
I'd love this area.

11:14.399 --> 11:15.415
Whoa.
But watch your step.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.250
There's a crevice.
Not in a bad way.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.678
It's the good kind of crevice.
(grunts)

11:22.015 --> 11:23.589
Okay, that's
a little bit alarming.

11:23.742 --> 11:27.427
I can see now that it doesn't
seem totally safe to be in here.

11:27.579 --> 11:28.578
So, can we go?

11:28.596 --> 11:29.929
Did I hear you say
five more minutes?

11:30.023 --> 11:30.763
That seems fair.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.765
-Louise!
-Ugh, okay.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.008
Crap.
It should not

11:34.027 --> 11:35.601
be this hard
to find a cannonball

11:35.754 --> 11:37.011
from the War of 1812.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.105
I want to write
an angry letter to somebody.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.182
Ken Burns, maybe?
Damn it.

11:41.276 --> 11:42.608
Yeah, damn, damn, damn.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.536
And also if we could just
pick up the pace a bit.

11:44.705 --> 11:45.929
-Tina.
-What is it?

11:45.947 --> 11:47.430
Something that we
can walk and talk about?

11:47.523 --> 11:49.265
Cannonball!

11:49.284 --> 11:51.267
Wait, seriously?
I can't believe it.

11:51.286 --> 11:52.769
Yeah, sneaky little cannonball.

11:52.787 --> 11:54.528
Thought you could hide from me.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.290
Oh, it's stuck.
Here, help me dig around it.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.050
-Louise!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, the tide.

11:59.277 --> 12:00.719
I know.
That's all you talk about now.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.111
Keep digging!
(grunting)

12:02.389 --> 12:03.704
I don't want to die,
I don't want to die.

12:03.798 --> 12:04.781
Saying that is super helpful.

12:04.799 --> 12:06.307
-Is it?
-No.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.212
I did it! I found it!
I'm the amazing girl

12:11.231 --> 12:13.064
who found a cannonball
in a stinky cave.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.715
Congratulations, Louise.
But you know

12:14.735 --> 12:17.310
what's a little more important
right now than that cannonball--

12:17.404 --> 12:19.812
-air, and breathing it.
-Agree to disagree.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.297
We have to go.

12:21.316 --> 12:22.982
Uh-uh, no way
am I leaving this thing.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.225
She's my baby now.

12:24.319 --> 12:25.985
Which makes you her aunt.
Keep digging.

12:26.137 --> 12:27.579
Louise, it's wedged
between the rocks.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.581
-Digging's not gonna help.
-Is that what they said

12:29.732 --> 12:31.491
when those raiders
discovered the lost Ark?

12:31.585 --> 12:33.084
-No. So dig.
-(groans)

12:33.236 --> 12:35.236
Dig till our faces melt off!

12:35.404 --> 12:36.921
BOB:
This is really not ideal.

12:37.073 --> 12:39.148
I like turning
my head like this.

12:39.167 --> 12:40.333
I'm stretching out my neck.

12:40.485 --> 12:41.742
Also, it's kind of like
you're in prison

12:41.762 --> 12:42.819
and I've come to visit you.

12:42.837 --> 12:44.578
-BOB: Mm.
-Hey, Kathleen.

12:44.672 --> 12:46.005
-Hiya.
-Kathleen, you made it.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.249
Wow!
Look at all this.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.935
It's fun, right?
Welcome to the Hurling Zone.

12:51.162 --> 12:52.845
(laughs) Eh...

12:52.939 --> 12:54.255
-Do you like the banners?
-Yeah.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.756
-I don't think it's too many.
-No.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.442
I-I think it's the right amount
of banners. And those

12:57.593 --> 12:59.519
are some fellow hurling heads.
(chuckles)

12:59.613 --> 13:01.762
Ooh, I think
some of them are from Ireland.

13:01.931 --> 13:03.006
Do you know them?

13:03.024 --> 13:03.931
It's a pretty
big country, Teddy.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.099
Oh, wait, that's my dad.

13:05.176 --> 13:06.509
-What?
-I'm kidding.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.011
-Right, right.
-Could be a cousin though.

13:08.029 --> 13:10.029
So, you folks
watch hurling, then?

13:10.106 --> 13:11.364
-They do now.
-Yeah, we do.

13:11.516 --> 13:13.516
-Sports.
-We're-we're trying it out today

13:13.535 --> 13:15.794
and seeing how it goes.
I don't love the screen

13:15.870 --> 13:17.036
being where it is

13:17.130 --> 13:19.355
and I-I miss the way
things were before.

13:19.374 --> 13:21.357
-Oh.
-But, yeah, everything's fine.

13:21.376 --> 13:23.876
I miss the way
things were before, too.

13:24.029 --> 13:24.952
When I could poop.

13:25.046 --> 13:26.379
-What?
-Don't look at me!

13:26.531 --> 13:27.697
-He's constipated.
-GENE: Just in my butt.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.533
-Uh, have a seat, Kathleen.
-Okay. Thank you.

13:30.626 --> 13:32.310
-Can you see okay?
-Yeah, sure.

13:32.537 --> 13:33.460
Is there any sound?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.129
It's coming
out of the projector.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.222
If you're really quiet,
you can hear it.

13:36.299 --> 13:37.816
Shh, shh, shh.
Do you hear it?

13:38.043 --> 13:38.817
Oh, yeah, there it is.

13:39.044 --> 13:40.043
Oh, it's starting.

13:40.061 --> 13:41.044
Look at those guys.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.378
Look at them hurl.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.380
Okay, I'm gonna pull.
Move over.

13:44.399 --> 13:46.215
TINA:
Quickly. They're gonna
be pulling us out of here

13:46.234 --> 13:48.234
-once we drown.
-Don't be so dramatic

13:48.328 --> 13:51.478
just because it might happen.
Hey, maybe we can pry it out.

13:51.573 --> 13:52.997
People pry stuff
out of things, right?

13:53.149 --> 13:54.815
And another wave.

13:54.909 --> 13:56.576
We've got this, Tina.
All that's left

13:56.728 --> 13:59.412
is to pop this sucker out
and skip to freedom.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.247
-I'm not very good at skipping.
-Aah!

14:01.399 --> 14:03.875
Just let go, cannonball.
Come to me.

14:04.027 --> 14:06.069
I can take you away
from all of this.

14:06.162 --> 14:07.846
Wow, look at them

14:07.997 --> 14:09.405
do what they're doing.

14:09.424 --> 14:11.424
I mean, I knew I was
gonna see some hurling,

14:11.500 --> 14:13.259
but I didn't know
I was gonna see hurling.

14:13.411 --> 14:16.020
Uh, yeah.
Excuse me, I have to go

14:16.172 --> 14:17.188
to the restroom.
I've been holding it in

14:17.415 --> 14:18.414
since, uh, I got here.
(short chuckle)

14:18.433 --> 14:20.007
GENE:
Have fun in there.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.934
-Must be nice.
-It's just a wee.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.844
GENE:
That's how they all start.

14:23.864 --> 14:24.770
-TEDDY: Guys.
-What?

14:24.923 --> 14:25.846
I'm so nervous.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.181
I-I don't get this game at all.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.608
Does it seem like
I know what I'm talking about?

14:28.702 --> 14:31.260
-Oh, yeah.
-Really? Good,
'cause I'm freaking out.

14:31.279 --> 14:34.097
Why? It's going good.
Right, Bob?

14:34.115 --> 14:35.281
Oh, oh, yeah.

14:35.433 --> 14:36.690
Um, from what I can see
from under here,

14:36.710 --> 14:40.103
you're-you're not acting
too strangely at all.

14:40.196 --> 14:42.380
Uh, no. What?
We don't want more fries.

14:42.531 --> 14:44.941
Always upselling the fries,
these two.

14:44.959 --> 14:47.051
-Oh, I'll take more fries.
-Great. More fries, please.

14:47.278 --> 14:48.720
That's what I was
trying to tell you, Bob.

14:48.871 --> 14:50.947
-You got to learn to listen.
-BOB: Mm-hmm.

14:50.965 --> 14:52.056
(Tina and Louise grunting)

14:52.208 --> 14:53.799
Pull harder!

14:53.968 --> 14:55.393
(both grunting)

14:55.544 --> 14:57.729
Oh! Oh, oh, my butt.

14:57.956 --> 14:59.880
(gasps) Tina, look. We did it!

14:59.900 --> 15:02.734
Yeah, great. Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

15:02.885 --> 15:03.960
Ow. Butt.

15:03.978 --> 15:04.903
Ow. So heavy.

15:05.130 --> 15:07.313
Ow. Butt. Okay, dropping it.

15:07.465 --> 15:10.133
-Okay, picking it up again.
Ow, ow,
-Faster.

15:10.151 --> 15:11.725
-ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
-Faster, faster.

15:11.819 --> 15:13.244
Oh, my butt. Oh, my butt.

15:13.471 --> 15:16.139
Okay, this crevice is probably
easier to jump over

15:16.232 --> 15:18.082
when you're not
carrying a heavy cannonball.

15:18.309 --> 15:19.976
I'm assuming. Stand back.

15:19.994 --> 15:21.568
I'm gonna shot-put
this baby over.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.479
Wait, is that a good idea?
Oh, you're doing it.

15:23.572 --> 15:24.830
-Aah!
-Aah!

15:24.925 --> 15:25.982
No! My angel!

15:26.000 --> 15:27.425
Aah!
I can't reach it.

15:27.652 --> 15:29.576
I can't even see it.
Where did it go?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.337
I'm pretty sure
it went down there.

15:31.414 --> 15:33.322
Is that not what
you wanted to hear?

15:33.341 --> 15:34.974
-Aah!
-Guess not.

15:38.587 --> 15:42.181
-Louise, we have to go.
-No. I can swim down and get it.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.834
It's fine, I'm already
covered in stink water.

15:44.852 --> 15:46.760
Do you have any scuba gear? No?

15:46.854 --> 15:49.338
That crevice is so deep
we can't even see the bottom.

15:49.357 --> 15:51.674
The cannonball is gone.
We have to go.

15:51.693 --> 15:52.617
-But...
-Now!

15:52.768 --> 15:55.178
(groans) Okay, fine.

15:55.196 --> 15:57.956
Let's go.
Goodbye, stupid cannonball.

15:58.183 --> 15:59.606
You could have
had a beautiful life.

15:59.701 --> 16:02.368
You could have been
part of show-and-tell history.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.463
Not just dumb old
War of 1812 history.

16:05.614 --> 16:08.091
-Up here.
-(grunts)

16:10.119 --> 16:12.470
Okay, that was probably
the last wave.

16:12.547 --> 16:14.263
Should we head back in?

16:15.049 --> 16:16.641
Yeah, never mind.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.702
Mmm. Oh, wow.
(laughs)

16:19.871 --> 16:21.370
It's like I'm nervous.

16:21.389 --> 16:22.647
Do you eat more
when you're nervous?

16:22.874 --> 16:24.557
I mean, I'm not.
I don't. I mean, I don't.

16:24.709 --> 16:25.966
-Yeah, no.
-Uh, Linda.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.319
-Can we get more fries, please?
-Uh, sure.

16:28.546 --> 16:30.304
This is so much better
than hockey.

16:30.398 --> 16:32.882
I-I can't even believe
I liked that garbage.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.516
And watched every game I could

16:34.518 --> 16:36.310
and I'm involved in a bunch
of fantasy hockey leagues.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.312
-Remind me to quit those.
-(chuckles): Okay.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.905
How we doing
on those fries, Bob?

16:40.058 --> 16:40.906
Coming up, Teddy.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.392
You literally
just ordered them.

16:43.411 --> 16:44.985
-Uh-oh. Oh, no.
-Oh, boy.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.005
-Oh...
-I think we're gonna head out.

16:47.232 --> 16:48.006
-Thanks.
-Wait.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.323
Where are you guys going?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.676
It's just a bit hard to hear.
And see.

16:51.827 --> 16:53.736
so we might watch the rest
at Julian's house.

16:53.829 --> 16:55.588
Uh, no, no, no.
Don't leave.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.590
This is the Hurling Zone.
We're having fun.

16:57.742 --> 16:58.850
Hey, can you believe, uh,

16:59.019 --> 17:00.743
how much those guys
shortened the grip?

17:00.836 --> 17:02.912
You said that a few times today.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.930
I'm not sure
you know what it means.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.024
But, thanks.
Bye.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.192
The grip.
They shortened it.

17:08.419 --> 17:09.935
Damn it. No, wait.
Don't you leave, too.

17:10.012 --> 17:11.529
I'll get better
at hurling watching.

17:11.756 --> 17:13.013
I'll learn to love it
and then we can

17:13.033 --> 17:14.681
have the same hobbies
and it'll be great.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.093
I was just getting up
to get more napkins, Teddy.

17:17.186 --> 17:18.611
Oh. Oh, good.
(chuckles)

17:18.763 --> 17:21.597
Ah! Oh. Something's changed.
Opportunity's knocking.

17:21.690 --> 17:22.689
Time to take my shot.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.024
-BOB: Ow.
-Sorry.

17:24.118 --> 17:25.451
Excuse me.
This is bigger than all of us!

17:25.545 --> 17:28.028
Teddy, it seems like
maybe you're trying

17:28.197 --> 17:30.531
way too hard for us
to like the same thing?

17:30.550 --> 17:31.440
Damn it.
Greasy fingers.

17:31.459 --> 17:33.384
But isn't that what people who

17:33.536 --> 17:35.628
may or may not
want to spend more time

17:35.780 --> 17:37.129
with another person do?

17:37.282 --> 17:38.890
Because, I mean, in the past,

17:39.117 --> 17:41.300
I've spent time
with people where we had

17:41.452 --> 17:43.895
none of the same interests
and it didn't end great,

17:44.122 --> 17:45.121
'cause we got divorced.

17:45.123 --> 17:46.213
Teddy, I think it's fine

17:46.232 --> 17:47.473
we have different interests.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.550
I like learning what
different stuff you like.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.569
And I already know about
what stuff I like.

17:51.796 --> 17:53.720
I don't even like
some of the stuff I like.

17:53.815 --> 17:55.055
-BOB: Come on.
-So, it's okay

17:55.149 --> 17:57.483
that I-I don't like
hurling very much? At all.

17:57.635 --> 17:59.468
And I can't seem to follow it
for some reason

17:59.562 --> 18:00.486
and it makes me angry?

18:00.638 --> 18:02.471
Of course it is.
You're not Irish.

18:02.490 --> 18:05.399
We legally have to like it.
Linda, tell him.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.326
Do you and Bob
like all the same things?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.478
Oh, God, no.
I like cool stuff

18:09.497 --> 18:10.663
and Bob likes
working on that little

18:10.757 --> 18:13.091
model airplane for, like,
the last ten years.

18:13.318 --> 18:14.575
It hasn't been ten years.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.410
Wait, it might be longer.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.929
-Crap.
-See?

18:18.156 --> 18:19.655
You big, stupid dummy.

18:19.748 --> 18:21.432
So I get to keep
all my hockey embroidery art

18:21.584 --> 18:22.767
-from Etsy?
-KATHLEEN: Hell no.

18:22.918 --> 18:25.252
-Okay.
-Teddy, of course you can.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.663
-Oh, thank God.
-Mom! Dad!

18:27.756 --> 18:29.423
The eagle has landed!

18:29.592 --> 18:31.334
I'm myself again.
I'm better than myself.

18:31.502 --> 18:33.277
I feel like
I can do a cartwheel.

18:33.429 --> 18:34.112
(grunts)

18:34.339 --> 18:35.613
Nope, still can't do that.

18:35.764 --> 18:37.448
We're very happy for you, Gene.

18:37.675 --> 18:39.175
You put in the effort
and you did it.

18:39.268 --> 18:41.285
You know, we don't have to watch
the second half, Teddy.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.121
It's-it's... it's just
a beautiful game,

18:43.272 --> 18:45.790
-and kind of
a metaphor for life.
-No, I want to.

18:46.017 --> 18:47.274
Now that I'm not
pretending to like it,

18:47.293 --> 18:48.793
-I-I might actually like it.
-Oh, my God.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.611
You like it because it doesn't
make any sense, is that right?

18:50.630 --> 18:52.279
I will stick this fork
in you, Teddy.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.615
All right, all right.
Teach me something.

18:54.709 --> 18:56.525
Okay, the ball
is called a sliotar.

18:56.619 --> 18:58.452
-TEDDY: Sleeter?
-KATHLEEN: (chuckles) Sliotar.

18:58.546 --> 19:00.138
-Shleeter.
-That's it. Kind of.

19:00.365 --> 19:01.788
TEDDY:
I never was good at languages.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.641
LOUISE:
Ugh. What a frickin' bust.

19:03.792 --> 19:07.203
No cannonball, my butt hurts,
I smell like a butt.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.054
(sniffs)
I think I might not smell.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.540
But it's hard to tell
'cause I'm walking next to you.

19:11.634 --> 19:12.966
What the hell am I gonna do
for tomorrow?

19:13.060 --> 19:15.227
Hey, what if we made
our own cannonball?

19:15.321 --> 19:16.637
No one knows
what they really look like.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.898
We could paint a Skee-Ball
from Wonder Wharf.

19:19.050 --> 19:19.991
They'll never know
the difference.

19:20.218 --> 19:21.492
I could put some
fake blood on it.

19:21.644 --> 19:23.494
Not sure if a cannonball
would have blood on it,

19:23.721 --> 19:24.662
just thinking out loud.

19:24.813 --> 19:26.146
You know, Louise, you could

19:26.166 --> 19:27.314
tell what really happened.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.059
Oh, what, Tina--
that I failed?

19:30.077 --> 19:31.502
That I lost the cannonball,

19:31.579 --> 19:33.729
I got stinky
sarguss-whatever on me,

19:33.822 --> 19:34.855
I bruised my butt?

19:34.916 --> 19:36.582
Everyone's always
talking about how cool

19:36.751 --> 19:39.844
butt bruises are, right?
No, I'm not doing that.

19:39.995 --> 19:41.679
Real life Louise
is too disappointing.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.348
Louise, I know you think
you've got to impress everybody,

19:44.500 --> 19:46.575
but I bet the kids in your class
would like to hear about

19:46.627 --> 19:48.761
the stuff that's maybe
a little embarrassing.

19:48.913 --> 19:51.505
Sometimes those stories
are even better than the stories

19:51.524 --> 19:53.749
where everything goes right.
'Cause they're real.

19:53.842 --> 19:56.009
And because that kind of stuff
happens to everybody.

19:56.029 --> 19:59.012
I mean, there's probably not
always a cannonball involved,

19:59.032 --> 20:00.347
but sometimes, I'm assuming?

20:00.441 --> 20:02.258
And I hope you won't
take it too personally

20:02.276 --> 20:04.202
if I walk
a few feet away from you.

20:04.429 --> 20:06.019
'Cause I mean,
it is personal, um,

20:06.113 --> 20:07.354
from a hygienic standpoint,

20:07.490 --> 20:09.624
but, you know.
You know what I mean.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.027
So, yeah, I tried,

20:14.047 --> 20:16.029
but I didn't get the cannonball,

20:16.123 --> 20:17.364
and... the end.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.533
Of show-and-tell,
for me, forever.

20:19.627 --> 20:22.127
Uh... so...

20:22.280 --> 20:23.462
What's that smell?

20:23.631 --> 20:26.115
It's called sargassum.
It's a stinky seaweed

20:26.117 --> 20:28.284
that I'm thinking of selling
to the government

20:28.302 --> 20:30.786
-as a biological weapon.
-(chuckling)

20:30.788 --> 20:33.456
The cool part is you can
wash your hair five times,

20:33.549 --> 20:34.640
and it doesn't come out.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.883
But luckily, I love
the smell of fish farts,

20:36.978 --> 20:38.402
-so that works for me.
-(laughing)

20:38.554 --> 20:40.404
Oh, and by the way,
I also fell

20:40.556 --> 20:42.631
and hit my butt on a rock.
I have a bruise

20:42.725 --> 20:46.059
that looks sort of like this.
Like Australia.

20:46.153 --> 20:49.580
-Or "Ass-tralia?"
-Louise, don't say Ass-tralia.

20:49.807 --> 20:51.140
And no butt drawings.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.233
Hey, no bruise shaming, Labonz.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.418
