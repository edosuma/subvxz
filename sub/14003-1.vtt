02:40.621 --> 02:42.582
Gypsy caravan.

02:44.459 --> 02:46.919
Honest-to-God Gypsies.

03:33.299 --> 03:34.759
Do I?

03:34.842 --> 03:37.386
- Do I have to?
- Oh, yes.

03:38.805 --> 03:39.972
Well?

03:40.056 --> 03:41.474
297.

03:43.142 --> 03:45.311
Billy, you were 297 last week.

03:45.394 --> 03:48.231
It takes some time
for these diets to work.

03:50.817 --> 03:53.069
Heidi, what are you doing to me?

03:53.152 --> 03:57.073
- Good morning.
- What you wanted me to do to you...

03:57.156 --> 03:59.534
in the backseat
of your father's car.

03:59.617 --> 04:01.452
I'm proving my love.

04:01.536 --> 04:06.707
- You gonna get Mr. Mafia off today?
- Please don't call him that.

04:06.791 --> 04:11.003
It's bad enough your father's
defending him. Jokes I can do without.

04:12.672 --> 04:16.591
You'll say this is justice.

04:16.676 --> 04:19.220
Keep it up,
I'll take your video card away.

04:19.303 --> 04:20.846
You would not.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.515
Try me, sweetheart.

04:22.598 --> 04:26.644
- I'm glad you two think this is funny.
- Come on.

04:26.727 --> 04:30.481
I wouldn't have taken Ginelli's case
unless I was convinced of his innocence.

04:30.565 --> 04:32.859
Maybe. This time.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.031
There's my ride.

04:39.115 --> 04:42.577
I go to wipe out
Tataglia's inert science.

04:44.745 --> 04:46.706
Bye. Love you.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.222
The defense calls Max Duggenfield
to the stand.

05:03.306 --> 05:05.475
Your Honor, I object.

05:05.558 --> 05:08.436
Considering the fact
that the defendant...

05:08.478 --> 05:11.439
is accused of ordering
Mr. Duggenfield's death...

05:11.481 --> 05:14.734
Mr. Halleck, are you sure
you want this witness to testify?

05:15.943 --> 05:18.237
If Max Duggenfield feels...

05:18.321 --> 05:21.783
my client paid $40,000
to have him killed...

05:21.824 --> 05:24.076
I want to hear him state it
in open court.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.745
Call Max Duggenfield to the stand.

05:25.828 --> 05:28.998
Mr. Max Duggenfield, please.

05:29.081 --> 05:34.462
- What the hell are you doing?
- Remember about that detective agency?

05:34.545 --> 05:38.382
- So this is really about...
- Pulling your ass out of the fire.

05:38.466 --> 05:40.384
Please raise your right hand.

05:40.468 --> 05:44.055
Do you swear to the tell the truth,
so help you God?

05:44.138 --> 05:46.724
- I do.
- State your name for the record.

05:46.808 --> 05:48.392
Max Duggenfield.

05:49.310 --> 05:51.521
Mr. Duggenfield.

05:54.482 --> 05:56.025
Anybody else out there...

05:56.109 --> 05:58.736
who might want to see you dead?

05:58.820 --> 06:02.323
- Maybe. Possibly.
- To your knowledge...

06:02.406 --> 06:05.451
has there ever been
a price on your head before?

06:06.369 --> 06:07.370
Well...

06:08.663 --> 06:11.666
- Three years ago...
- Who was it?

06:11.749 --> 06:14.669
Who took a contract out on your life
three years ago?

06:14.752 --> 06:16.420
- Objection!
- Overruled.

06:17.672 --> 06:20.508
Well, it was my wife.

06:20.550 --> 06:25.805
She got feisty this one time.
The P.M.S. Thing maybe.

06:25.888 --> 06:28.015
You know how they get.

06:28.099 --> 06:30.393
Then there was this money matter...

06:30.476 --> 06:32.478
Your Honor...

06:32.562 --> 06:35.189
Now that she's gone through
the change...

06:35.273 --> 06:37.984
everything is beautiful.

06:44.824 --> 06:46.200
Grazie, Mama.

06:47.827 --> 06:49.036
Guillermo...

06:50.121 --> 06:51.247
grazie.

06:57.962 --> 07:00.423
- Just doing my job.
- Fuck that.

07:00.506 --> 07:03.092
I owe you a big one, William.

07:04.177 --> 07:05.803
Listen.

07:07.805 --> 07:11.392
I know you had to lobby
Mr. Lily-White-Collar-Partner...

07:11.476 --> 07:14.228
to take this case, so...

07:14.312 --> 07:17.231
What this is really all about is...

07:17.315 --> 07:20.568
Even after I'm done paying your firm
a fucking fortune...

07:20.651 --> 07:23.404
I'm still gonna owe you,
big time.

07:24.697 --> 07:26.115
Mangia!

07:43.925 --> 07:46.010
Play with fire?

08:04.070 --> 08:08.741
You got it, mister.
You tried the rest, now try the best.

08:14.622 --> 08:19.085
What you think?
Come on, everybody! It's fun!

08:29.762 --> 08:32.140
They're coming this afternoon
to fix the elevator.

08:32.222 --> 08:35.434
And congratulations.
You made the noon news.

08:36.477 --> 08:40.857
Hey, Billy, you pulled it off.
I never would have believed it possible.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.359
Kirk Penschley proves once again...

08:43.443 --> 08:46.028
without faith,
good deeds are dead.

08:46.112 --> 08:49.866
Hey, kiddo, you gotta take
a few pounds off there.

08:49.949 --> 08:52.869
Come on.
I want to show you something.

08:52.952 --> 08:56.205
Have you looked across the street
this morning?

08:57.290 --> 08:59.667
Check this out.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.086
Do you see that Gypsy
piece of ass down there?

09:02.170 --> 09:03.921
How can I miss her?

09:04.005 --> 09:07.967
All right. Give her this quarter,
tell her to raise her skirt.

09:09.635 --> 09:13.222
- Didn't your prick escape sixth grade?
- I hope not.

09:13.306 --> 09:15.057
What's the matter?

09:15.141 --> 09:17.059
Afraid she heard you?

09:18.311 --> 09:20.730
I'm taking the afternoon off.

09:20.813 --> 09:23.399
- Say "Good afternoon, Billy. "
- Good afternoon, Billy.

09:25.193 --> 09:29.614
Don't forget tonight at the club.
We'll celebrate.

09:43.544 --> 09:45.421
What's taking Hopley so long?

09:45.505 --> 09:48.424
- They should have been out hours ago.
- Hi, Judge.

09:48.508 --> 09:52.553
I want to thank you for turning me on
to that detective agency.

09:52.637 --> 09:55.264
- It won me a big case this morning.
- Forget that.

09:55.348 --> 09:58.434
We've been invaded by a bunch
of filthy, thieving Gypsies.

09:58.518 --> 10:01.562
I don't know, Judge.
They bring a little fun.

10:01.646 --> 10:04.232
They bring disease, crime
and prostitution.

10:04.315 --> 10:07.443
- What fun is that?
- Who's the old guy?

10:07.527 --> 10:10.530
Their chief. Named Lempke.

10:15.618 --> 10:18.412
- At last. Good riddance.
- Not yet.

10:18.496 --> 10:22.250
They've rented some land
at Lars Ancaster's farm.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.293
You can't drive them off
private property.

10:24.335 --> 10:28.923
Yes, you can. Unless you want the high
school football team down with the clap.

10:29.006 --> 10:32.468
They make their money on dog fights!

10:32.510 --> 10:34.762
Hey, Judge, no problem.

11:34.739 --> 11:37.617
To Dell Barton
Investigative Services...

11:37.700 --> 11:39.619
the best in New England.

11:39.702 --> 11:43.956
And to winning.
May it ever be so sweet.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.458
Here, here.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.796
Easy, boy.
Down, boy.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.632
No, no, no. No, no.

11:52.715 --> 11:55.802
No way, my hero.
We're out of here before you explode.

11:55.885 --> 11:58.471
- The party is over. Let's go.
- Can you get the cars?

11:58.554 --> 12:02.517
I'll get the car. We'll pick up
a pound cake on the way out.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.352
No, no, no.

12:13.194 --> 12:16.739
- You've got to stop eating like that.
- I know.

12:16.823 --> 12:20.118
Billy, I want you
to stop digging your grave...

12:20.201 --> 12:22.495
with a spoon and fork.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.038
I love you.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.873
I love you.

12:27.416 --> 12:30.586
Otherwise, I'd keep my mouth shut.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.423
I can't help it, Heidi.

12:34.507 --> 12:37.009
All I think about is food.

12:37.093 --> 12:42.849
Maybe I ought to help you
try to think about something else.

12:47.061 --> 12:48.771
Heidi.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.607
Still thinking about food?

13:09.375 --> 13:11.294
I want you fill this...

13:11.377 --> 13:13.212
for my nose.

13:14.922 --> 13:18.634
- What you look at?
- Nothing. Nothing.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.136
Go ahead.

13:23.055 --> 13:26.809
There's so much more to life
than food.

13:29.479 --> 13:32.106
- Just...
- What?

13:32.148 --> 13:33.941
Just don't stop.

13:34.025 --> 13:35.985
Don't stop what?

13:37.153 --> 13:39.864
- Please.
- Please what?

13:39.947 --> 13:41.699
Please, please, please.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.702
Papa, it is cold.

13:44.786 --> 13:47.121
I'll go get my coat.

14:21.864 --> 14:22.865
God!

14:33.501 --> 14:38.923
- How come you get a trial so quick?
- It isn't a trial.

14:39.006 --> 14:43.094
It's a coroner's inquest,
a much simpler proceeding.

14:43.177 --> 14:46.431
But it was an accident.

14:46.514 --> 14:49.600
So what's the worst
that could happen?

14:49.684 --> 14:51.894
Nothing will happen
to your father, Linda.

14:51.978 --> 14:56.107
- He didn't do anything wrong.
- So you'll totally get off?

14:56.190 --> 14:59.444
There's nothing to "get off" from.
I didn't do anything wrong.

14:59.527 --> 15:01.487
An accident is not a crime.

15:08.995 --> 15:12.290
You saw the old woman
leave the store, Mr. Bangor.

15:12.373 --> 15:17.295
- She was running?
- I guess so. They were stealing.

15:17.378 --> 15:21.466
Yes, but she was running?
That's what I want to establish.

15:21.549 --> 15:25.970
I can't say for sure.
I was in the back of the pharmacy...

15:26.053 --> 15:29.390
That will be all, Mr. Bangor.
You may step down.

15:30.141 --> 15:31.601
Chief Hopley.

15:38.649 --> 15:43.112
Chief, perhaps you can help us.

15:43.154 --> 15:45.907
Was Mr. Halleck traveling
within the legal speed limit?

15:45.990 --> 15:48.659
Yes, sir.
We have witnesses...

15:48.743 --> 15:50.495
and his skid marks confirmed that.

15:50.578 --> 15:51.871
Was he Breathalyzed?

15:51.954 --> 15:53.873
Yes, sir.

15:53.956 --> 15:56.292
Results?

15:56.375 --> 16:01.422
Well, sir, Mr. Halleck was
as sober as a judge, Judge.

16:02.507 --> 16:05.259
Under the circumstances,
I'll let that go.

16:05.343 --> 16:07.678
You are dismissed, Chief.

16:13.684 --> 16:17.772
This court finds no grounds
on which to charge William Halleck...

16:19.357 --> 16:23.611
in the death of Suzanne Lempke,
which is hereby ruled accidental.

16:23.694 --> 16:25.947
This hearing is closed.

16:32.161 --> 16:34.080
- You drive.
- Mm-hmm.

16:43.965 --> 16:45.383
Sir?

16:47.802 --> 16:49.262
Thinner.

17:06.529 --> 17:09.281
Get in the car.

17:25.757 --> 17:29.427
283. Somebody call Richard Simmons.

17:36.309 --> 17:39.812
- Did you weigh yourself?
- 283.

17:39.896 --> 17:42.565
283. No fooling?

17:42.648 --> 17:44.108
No fooling.

17:47.236 --> 17:50.156
That is 14 pounds in seven days.

17:50.239 --> 17:53.534
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

17:54.619 --> 17:56.078
You look slimmer.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.706
I haven't seen you stop eating.

17:58.790 --> 18:01.918
- Maybe it's guilt.
- That's stupid.

18:02.001 --> 18:05.755
It hasn't affected my diet
any more than it's affected yours.

18:18.559 --> 18:20.770
Ahhh!

18:20.853 --> 18:24.774
- Why did I come out here today?
- For the exercise.

18:24.857 --> 18:27.276
From the looks of you,
it's finally doing some good.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.071
There's nothing like avoiding
a manslaughter charge...

18:30.154 --> 18:32.156
to turn a man's life around.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.535
That's witty, Kirk,
and compassionate too.

18:35.618 --> 18:38.079
- What did he say?
- Foot-in-mouth disease.

18:38.162 --> 18:41.582
That kind of attitude
could cost you court cases...

18:41.624 --> 18:43.584
especially in my court.

18:43.626 --> 18:49.298
You leave me alone, or I'll get Billy
to run you over in that golf cart.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.050
- Kirk.
- What?

18:51.134 --> 18:54.554
Give me a little kiss, sweetheart.
Right here.

18:56.556 --> 18:59.058
Billy, have you lost your mind?

19:01.144 --> 19:05.940
That's surprisingly easy to do
once you've lost a few pounds.

19:05.982 --> 19:07.442
Come on.

19:11.487 --> 19:14.282
Mike, look at this, would you?

19:21.164 --> 19:23.291
- Your psoriasis is coming back.
- Why?

19:23.374 --> 19:25.585
"Why ask why?"
As they say on TV.

19:25.626 --> 19:29.046
Stress probably.
Use that ointment from last time.

19:31.924 --> 19:35.386
- Hey!
- For horses. Better for cows.

19:35.511 --> 19:38.723
281!

19:38.806 --> 19:42.727
I've lost two pounds since this morning?
Is that possible?

19:42.810 --> 19:47.440
Relax. Soon you'll be able to see
your balls without using a mirror.

19:56.032 --> 19:58.576
Listen, Cary...

19:58.659 --> 20:02.121
I never really thanked you
for taking care of me.

20:03.206 --> 20:06.918
Never told you what happened
right after that, did I?

20:07.001 --> 20:09.295
Leda and I went to lunch.

20:09.378 --> 20:12.131
When we came out,
that old gyp was waiting for me.

20:12.215 --> 20:15.551
- The one with the...
- Yeah, him.

20:15.635 --> 20:19.514
He walked up and touched me,
right here.

20:21.224 --> 20:24.018
Did he say anything?

20:24.102 --> 20:26.312
How the hell should I know?

20:26.395 --> 20:29.774
I was worried I might catch
impetigo from him.

20:29.899 --> 20:31.859
Or lice!

20:41.160 --> 20:44.497
- I want you to go off this diet.
- Does it look like I'm on a diet?

20:45.748 --> 20:47.250
When did you stop?

20:49.210 --> 20:51.170
About a week ago.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.345
That's another 25 pounds.

21:00.596 --> 21:04.225
That's over 40 pounds
in two weeks?

21:04.308 --> 21:07.019
Make up your mind.
Do you want me fat or thin?

21:10.148 --> 21:11.566
I just...

21:13.943 --> 21:19.699
I was thinking that sudden weight loss
is an early warning sign of...

21:21.784 --> 21:24.370
- Of what?
- You know what.

21:25.496 --> 21:28.207
Christ! If I gain weight,
I have a heart attack.

21:28.291 --> 21:30.460
If I lose weight,
I have cancer.

21:31.502 --> 21:32.962
I can't win.

21:34.338 --> 21:36.799
I ran into Mike Houston
yesterday.

21:38.551 --> 21:40.720
He wants you
to take a few tests.

21:46.392 --> 21:47.977
All right.

21:48.060 --> 21:53.149
If you don't want to do it for yourself,
and you don't want to do it for me...

21:53.232 --> 21:55.193
will you do it for Linda?

21:59.030 --> 22:00.490
Everything's fine.

22:02.575 --> 22:04.535
- "Fine"?
- Yeah.

22:06.662 --> 22:09.582
Your blood work is five by five.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.877
That's better than mine, in fact.

22:12.960 --> 22:18.674
Let's see, cholesterol
and triglycerides are both down.

22:20.635 --> 22:24.263
You haven't been this healthy since you
banged Mary Lou Singer in high school.

22:24.347 --> 22:28.184
Sangster,
and I never got into her pants.

22:29.185 --> 22:31.854
Mike, are you sure about this?

22:31.938 --> 22:36.484
I weigh 240 pounds. I've lost
the equivalent of a fucking suitcase.

22:36.567 --> 22:39.779
Look, Billy...

22:39.862 --> 22:42.865
the important thing here
is for you to relax.

22:42.949 --> 22:45.576
Just stop thinking about this.

22:45.660 --> 22:48.871
Your weight will stabilize,
and you'll gain some back.

22:48.913 --> 22:52.625
Believe me,
everything is gonna be all right.

22:53.793 --> 22:56.003
Mr. Halleck!

22:56.087 --> 22:59.048
I see you finally found
a diet that works.

22:59.132 --> 23:01.259
You look wonderful.

23:01.342 --> 23:02.969
Right, and I...

23:03.052 --> 23:06.222
want a whole new wardrobe to go with
my new look, so you might want to...

23:06.305 --> 23:09.183
Well, let's do it!

23:15.857 --> 23:20.319
You're down to a pant 40.
Maybe even 38.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.198
That can't be right.

23:27.118 --> 23:28.536
Do you have a scale?

23:39.422 --> 23:41.132
This diet you're on...

23:41.215 --> 23:42.717
what is it?

23:42.800 --> 23:46.429
I've tried all the others.
I might as well try this one.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.181
I don't think you'd like it, Henry.

23:48.264 --> 23:53.019
In fact,
I don't think you'd like it at all.

24:13.289 --> 24:14.707
Dad.

24:21.047 --> 24:22.465
Can I ask you a question?

24:25.968 --> 24:30.306
Is there such a thing
as, like, male menopause?

24:30.389 --> 24:34.352
- I mean, hormones that, like...
- What are you trying to say?

24:36.229 --> 24:37.688
I'm worried about you.

24:39.023 --> 24:42.985
What's there to worry about?
I found a diet that works.

24:43.027 --> 24:45.363
Eat all you want
and still lose the weight.

24:55.998 --> 24:58.501
- What happened?
- I don't know. I must've said something.

24:58.584 --> 25:03.673
Don't. You'll only upset her more.
There.

25:07.260 --> 25:09.846
Billy, will you please slow down?

25:09.887 --> 25:11.848
Why are you eating like that?

25:11.889 --> 25:13.891
I don't know
if it's all in my head.

25:13.933 --> 25:17.520
- Dr. Mikey thinks it is.
- I hate when you call him that.

25:17.562 --> 25:22.483
I do know one thing: I've lost three
pounds a day every day until today.

25:22.567 --> 25:24.652
You're putting weight back on?
That's wonderful.

25:24.735 --> 25:27.697
Today, I skipped lunch.
Instead of being three pounds lighter...

25:27.738 --> 25:30.825
when I got home from the office,
I'm six pounds lighter.

25:30.908 --> 25:33.244
You see, I have to eat like this.

25:33.327 --> 25:35.246
It's a race,
and I'm losing.

25:35.329 --> 25:39.459
- You sound mean, as if it's my fault.
- I'm sorry.

25:39.542 --> 25:42.462
Was I giving myself a blow job
just then?

25:42.545 --> 25:44.922
That is a horrible thing to say.

25:46.340 --> 25:50.762
I don't remember you complaining
about it at the time.

25:52.513 --> 25:55.016
Linda should go visit her Aunt Rhoda
for a few weeks.

25:57.268 --> 26:01.272
- What?
- She can't watch you go through this.

26:01.355 --> 26:04.901
It's tearing her apart.
Look at what just happened.

26:04.942 --> 26:07.153
I'll drive her there tomorrow.

26:20.700 --> 26:23.995
Billy. Finally got through
to that specialist.

26:24.078 --> 26:25.246
And?

26:25.329 --> 26:29.000
Good news. Based on your test results
and what I've told him...

26:29.083 --> 26:31.752
it's definitely not a parasite.

26:31.836 --> 26:34.005
Not a tapeworm.

26:34.088 --> 26:37.341
- What does he recommend?
- The Glassman Clinic.

26:37.425 --> 26:39.760
They're expecting you tomorrow.

26:40.928 --> 26:44.056
And, Billy, even if
you don't want to go...

26:44.140 --> 26:47.226
you have to,
for Heidi's sake.

26:47.310 --> 26:48.728
She's upset.

26:49.854 --> 26:51.272
Mike.

26:51.355 --> 26:53.399
Leda was eating alone
again last night.

26:53.482 --> 26:56.360
Is the judge sick?

26:56.444 --> 26:57.862
Out of town.

26:57.945 --> 27:01.574
His sister was
in a pretty bad car accident.

27:01.657 --> 27:04.327
Cary Rossington
doesn't have a sister.

27:06.704 --> 27:10.541
Then it was Leda's sister.
You have to relax.

27:10.625 --> 27:12.543
See you tomorrow.

27:30.269 --> 27:31.520
Leda.

27:31.604 --> 27:34.482
Is Cary in?

27:34.565 --> 27:37.777
He's in Minnesota
visiting relatives.

27:39.904 --> 27:42.948
What's wrong with him?
Has he lost weight?

27:43.032 --> 27:45.493
What are you talking about?

27:47.870 --> 27:50.206
I've lost 100 pounds.

27:50.247 --> 27:52.959
That's spelled
with a one and two zeroes.

27:54.919 --> 27:56.963
It was the Gypsies, wasn't it?

27:57.046 --> 27:59.382
What do you mean, "Gypsies"?

27:59.465 --> 28:03.386
Did the old man touch you?

28:03.427 --> 28:05.513
What does that have to do with...

28:05.596 --> 28:08.641
Come on in, Billy.

28:12.770 --> 28:15.356
Here. You'll need this.

28:28.911 --> 28:31.163
He is in Minnesota...

28:31.247 --> 28:34.417
but he's not visiting relatives.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.669
He's at the Mayo Clinic.

28:36.752 --> 28:38.087
Leda...

28:40.131 --> 28:44.844
there's no such thing
as Gypsy curses.

28:44.927 --> 28:47.430
You trying to convince me
or yourself?

28:47.513 --> 28:52.560
He came up to us as we were coming out
of La Zuppas, that place over in Milton.

28:54.020 --> 28:56.188
Cary was hunting for his keys.

28:56.272 --> 28:59.150
He never saw the old man coming.

28:59.233 --> 29:02.320
I did. I tried to warn him,
but I was too late.

29:04.322 --> 29:05.740
He touched him.

29:05.823 --> 29:08.367
Then he whispered something
in his ear.

29:09.493 --> 29:13.080
Cary claims he didn't hear
what it was.

29:13.164 --> 29:14.582
I heard.

29:17.084 --> 29:18.252
What?

29:18.336 --> 29:20.254
What did he say?

29:21.922 --> 29:23.591
One word.

29:28.763 --> 29:30.264
Lizard.

29:32.725 --> 29:36.687
His skin was plating,
turning into scales.

29:36.771 --> 29:39.732
It's evolution in reverse.

29:39.815 --> 29:43.069
A sideshow freak.
Lord Jesus.

29:45.196 --> 29:47.406
He chartered a plane
to take him to the Mayo.

29:47.490 --> 29:52.078
Did I tell you that? He can't bear
to have people look at him.

29:52.161 --> 29:57.041
At the end, before he left,
his hands were like claws!

29:57.124 --> 30:02.588
His eyes were just two bright little
specks inside these deep hollows.

30:02.630 --> 30:06.696
Like pieces of tin foil!
And his nose...

30:06.731 --> 30:10.763
I have to go
to the Glassman Clinic.

30:10.846 --> 30:13.516
I have a metabolic disorder.

30:13.557 --> 30:15.768
Why did you come here?

30:15.810 --> 30:18.187
Why are you looking
for my husband?

30:18.270 --> 30:20.356
I just wanted
to compare notes.

30:20.439 --> 30:22.900
God. What did he say to you?

30:22.984 --> 30:25.820
- What did the old gyp say to you?
- Nothing!

30:25.903 --> 30:27.863
I don't believe that.

30:27.947 --> 30:30.783
I believe it's all your fault.
You hit that old lady!

30:30.908 --> 30:36.122
You were the one that hit her!
You! Not Cary!

30:36.205 --> 30:39.792
I wrote on the fence, but your husband
slapped on the whitewash.

30:39.875 --> 30:42.378
He was too happy to do it.

30:43.629 --> 30:46.632
Have a nice stay
at the Glassman, Billy.

30:48.134 --> 30:50.928
I hear the food's good.

30:52.471 --> 30:54.473
There's no such thing
as a Gypsy curse.

30:54.515 --> 30:56.767
You come back in another
couple of weeks...

30:56.809 --> 31:00.104
after you've lost
another 40 or 50 pounds!

31:00.187 --> 31:03.441
Tell me what you believe then!

31:03.482 --> 31:05.943
Yes, you tell me
what you believe then!

31:05.985 --> 31:07.611
You hear me?

31:07.653 --> 31:10.448
You tell me what you believe then!

31:10.531 --> 31:12.533
You tell me!

31:13.659 --> 31:15.661
- You gave me that.
- I did?

31:15.745 --> 31:18.748
Mr. Ginelli,
it's Billy Halleck for you.

31:21.167 --> 31:25.921
- What can I do for you?
- I got a crazy question for you.

31:26.005 --> 31:27.423
Go ahead, Counselor.

31:29.300 --> 31:33.471
Do you believe Gypsies
can curse people?

31:34.972 --> 31:40.561
I tend to believe what my friends
tell me and what I can see.

31:40.645 --> 31:45.149
My mother is a different story.
Hold on.

31:53.115 --> 31:54.158
Si.

32:01.374 --> 32:05.461
She says she believes.
She knew Gypsies in the old country.

32:05.544 --> 32:08.798
She says whoever puts it on
has to take it off. No one else can.

32:09.632 --> 32:10.925
No one else.

32:11.008 --> 32:12.426
What's this all about?

32:12.510 --> 32:15.554
I'll get back to you. Thank you.

32:22.353 --> 32:26.148
What happened
at the Rossington's last night?

32:26.232 --> 32:32.029
Leda Rossington thinks that old Gypsy,
Tadzu Lempke, put a curse on Cary and I.

32:33.531 --> 32:34.991
What?

32:35.074 --> 32:39.203
I know how it sounds,
but that's what she thinks.

32:42.123 --> 32:44.542
You see...

32:44.625 --> 32:48.879
Cary has this skin cancer...

32:48.963 --> 32:52.675
Billy, there is no such thing
as a Gypsy curse.

32:52.758 --> 32:57.555
Even if there were, it wouldn't just
be you and Cary that Lempke would curse.

32:57.638 --> 32:59.557
It would be the entire town.

32:59.598 --> 33:01.100
Yeah?

33:01.142 --> 33:04.895
The whole town didn't kill his wife
and then try and cover it up.

33:04.979 --> 33:07.440
It was me and Cary and...

33:07.523 --> 33:09.317
What?

33:10.151 --> 33:12.403
It would be Hopley too.

33:13.487 --> 33:15.948
He was in on the cover-up.

33:18.618 --> 33:20.119
Billy...

33:21.329 --> 33:23.581
all you have to do right now...

33:23.664 --> 33:27.418
is to think about checking yourself
into the clinic and getting better.

33:27.501 --> 33:29.045
That's all.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.339
Look out!

33:37.136 --> 33:39.305
We're here.

33:44.143 --> 33:46.062
Hopley, answer, damn it.

33:46.145 --> 33:49.231
- Good morning, Mr. Halleck.
- Morning.

33:49.315 --> 33:51.692
We've used the computer
to synthesize your test results.

33:53.486 --> 33:54.904
Amazing.

33:54.987 --> 33:59.200
Over 12,000 calories a day,
and you continue to lose weight.

34:00.576 --> 34:01.994
Here you are.

34:02.078 --> 34:05.331
Extra whipped cream,
just as you specified.

34:05.414 --> 34:09.918
We have some good protocols.
They'll take a week or two to work out.

34:10.002 --> 34:13.089
What if that
doesn't tell you anything?

34:13.172 --> 34:16.634
We'll keep running tests.
We won't give up.

34:16.717 --> 34:19.136
Rest assured of that.

34:24.516 --> 34:28.228
- Where are you going?
- To get some takeout.

34:38.781 --> 34:41.742
Duncan, it's Billy Halleck.

34:41.826 --> 34:45.538
The guy at the station house
said you were home sick.

34:45.621 --> 34:47.206
You okay?

34:55.797 --> 34:59.176
Come on, Duncan.
I know about the judge.

34:59.260 --> 35:01.220
What's happened to you?

35:03.139 --> 35:05.349
I don't really think
you want to know...

35:06.475 --> 35:07.893
but come on in.

35:59.779 --> 36:02.073
So...

36:02.114 --> 36:06.410
now Rossington looks like
what he was all along.

36:09.664 --> 36:12.416
That's funny.

36:12.458 --> 36:17.380
And look at you.
You finally found a diet that works.

36:19.465 --> 36:22.259
Whatever we did,
we don't deserve this.

36:22.301 --> 36:25.846
No? You ran the old lady down.

36:25.930 --> 36:31.686
Rossington fixed it so points weren't
even taken off your driving record.

36:31.769 --> 36:37.024
And I just ran the whole pack
of them out of the county.

36:37.108 --> 36:41.862
Come on. I'm not a criminal.
I wasn't drunk.

36:41.946 --> 36:44.031
How would I know?

36:44.115 --> 36:48.619
I didn't give you a Breathalyzer test.
I said I did.

36:48.703 --> 36:53.249
That's just the way we do things
here in Fairview, isn't it?

36:54.792 --> 36:56.585
What the hell.

36:58.296 --> 37:01.465
- Old lady was jaywalking.
- I wasn't drunk.

37:03.301 --> 37:05.886
Maybe there was
something else going on, though.

37:05.970 --> 37:09.307
- Like what?
- Never mind.

37:10.850 --> 37:15.521
I want to find the old guy
and tell him we don't deserve this.

37:15.604 --> 37:18.733
You think he put a curse on you?

37:18.816 --> 37:22.069
Good old-fashioned Gypsy curse,
like in Shock Theater?

37:22.153 --> 37:26.198
Does it matter?
I have some things to say to him.

37:26.282 --> 37:28.826
Maybe you want to come with me?

37:36.584 --> 37:39.003
Christ, Hopley.

37:39.045 --> 37:41.255
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

37:42.757 --> 37:45.051
Yours is just a little slower.

37:45.134 --> 37:47.845
You'll get there eventually.

37:47.928 --> 37:50.473
I am not going anywhere.

37:52.933 --> 37:56.354
You find him, Billy.

37:57.480 --> 37:59.690
You find him.

37:59.774 --> 38:01.192
When you do...

38:04.779 --> 38:08.658
I want you to kill that old bastard
and say it's from me.

38:10.451 --> 38:11.786
I can't.

38:11.869 --> 38:14.580
I can't kill him.

38:14.664 --> 38:18.501
I need him to take the curse off.
He's the only one who can, I think.

38:18.584 --> 38:22.546
You think he'll take it off?

38:22.630 --> 38:27.969
Are you gonna snivel up to him
and say, "I'm so sorry"?

38:28.052 --> 38:30.846
Look how sorry I am!

38:31.764 --> 38:33.557
Don't be stupid!

38:34.600 --> 38:38.896
Take the gun! Go on.

38:39.981 --> 38:41.691
Take it.

38:41.774 --> 38:45.903
Take the gun.
Take the gun.

38:45.987 --> 38:47.905
Take the goddamn gun!

38:48.990 --> 38:51.701
Take the gun!
Shoot him!

38:51.784 --> 38:56.580
It's the only satisfaction you'll get,
'cause he'll never take the curse off!

38:58.291 --> 38:59.709
Never!

39:01.669 --> 39:04.338
Never!

39:42.918 --> 39:47.423
Mike Houston was here.
Why did you leave the clinic?

39:48.633 --> 39:50.509
Billy?

39:50.593 --> 39:52.511
Are you all right?

39:55.264 --> 39:56.682
Fine.

39:58.434 --> 40:01.145
We care about you, sweetheart.
I care about you.

40:01.228 --> 40:02.688
Linda.

40:04.482 --> 40:06.734
The doctors at the Glassman Clinic
can't help me.

40:06.817 --> 40:10.279
If they can't help you,
who do you think can?

40:10.363 --> 40:13.199
I saw Duncan Hopley
before I came home.

40:15.618 --> 40:18.162
He offered to give me his gun.
I didn't take it.

40:18.245 --> 40:21.832
- Thank God!
- I probably should have, though.

40:21.958 --> 40:24.085
I heard a gunshot after I left.

40:24.168 --> 40:28.714
Maybe Duncan saw a rat and decided
to do a little brain surgery on it...

40:28.798 --> 40:30.716
but I don't think so.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.761
Lempke cursed him too.
His face...

40:33.844 --> 40:38.307
Please. Please! Please don't go
through that curse thing again!

40:38.391 --> 40:40.518
What else can it be?

40:40.601 --> 40:42.937
I'm not on a diet!

40:43.020 --> 40:45.773
It's not anorexia!
I don't have a tapeworm!

40:45.815 --> 40:50.111
I've been eating like mad for six weeks!
12,000 calories a day, at least!

40:50.194 --> 40:52.405
And I'm still losing weight!

40:53.531 --> 40:57.410
I'm being erased.

41:23.227 --> 41:26.731
What about the Glassman?
They keep calling me about you.

41:26.814 --> 41:28.774
Forget the Glassman.

41:28.816 --> 41:32.743
Heidi told me what you said
about this curse thing.

41:32.778 --> 41:36.115
Tells you a lot, doesn't she?
Whispers little secrets in your ear.

41:36.157 --> 41:38.784
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Forget it.

41:38.826 --> 41:41.287
All you need to remember
is it's not "a thing. "

41:41.329 --> 41:44.290
It's a fact, a curse.

41:44.332 --> 41:46.959
If you don't believe me,
ask Rossington.

41:47.001 --> 41:51.422
Heidi told me what you said about him,
so I called Leda.

41:51.505 --> 41:53.841
He's got skin cancer.
He's being treated.

41:53.924 --> 41:56.385
Skin cancer, my ass.

41:56.469 --> 41:58.929
You are running out of time.

41:59.013 --> 42:02.475
No shit. In two weeks, I won't be able
to go to the bathroom by myself.

42:02.516 --> 42:05.478
- You have to go back to the clinic.
- Wrong.

42:05.519 --> 42:08.147
I have to find those Gypsies.

42:11.192 --> 42:14.612
- Do you see what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, I think he's in trouble.

42:15.696 --> 42:19.992
He's very irrational.
If I were you...

42:28.250 --> 42:30.002
Oh, Mike.

42:32.046 --> 42:33.965
Tadzu Lempke.

42:34.048 --> 42:38.094
Their king. Also, father of the woman
you struck with your car.

42:40.388 --> 42:41.847
Father?

42:44.016 --> 42:45.601
That's impossible.

42:45.685 --> 42:48.270
That woman was old: 75, 80.

42:48.354 --> 42:50.773
Lempke is 106.

42:50.856 --> 42:55.319
This is his great-granddaughter
and her husband.

42:55.403 --> 42:57.280
106.

42:57.363 --> 43:02.285
He claimed to be 29 when he entered
the country from Europe in 1917.

43:02.368 --> 43:04.620
You figure it out.

43:04.704 --> 43:07.123
You want to talk
about where they're going?

43:08.416 --> 43:09.959
Okay.

43:10.042 --> 43:13.462
I tracked them to Raintree.
Then Milford.

43:13.546 --> 43:15.715
Then Greenough,
which I had never heard of.

43:15.798 --> 43:17.967
Where do you think
they're headed now?

43:18.050 --> 43:20.136
Headed up the Maine coast.

43:20.219 --> 43:24.181
They're always in Bar Harbor at the end
of the season. Pick them up there.

43:26.058 --> 43:28.561
I don't have that much time.

43:48.497 --> 43:51.417
I have the order.
All you have to do is sign it.

43:51.500 --> 43:55.254
To sign it?
I don't know.

43:55.338 --> 43:58.090
Maybe you're right.

43:58.174 --> 44:02.094
I know you don't want to,
but it's best for both of us.

44:02.178 --> 44:05.473
If we take legal action,
what will he do when he finds out?

44:05.556 --> 44:07.099
What kind of legal action?

44:14.857 --> 44:18.778
The kind that forces you back to the
Glassman Clinic before it's too late.

44:28.162 --> 44:29.538
Okay.

44:29.622 --> 44:31.415
I'll go back.

44:31.499 --> 44:33.918
Oh, Billy!

44:34.001 --> 44:36.921
I am so happy.

44:46.847 --> 44:50.059
Dear Heidi,
I'm going after Lempke.

44:50.142 --> 44:52.770
The old guy knows what I did,
but not what you did.

44:52.853 --> 44:56.107
That frees you up to believe
the curse is in my head.

44:56.190 --> 45:00.903
Unfortunately, that's a luxury
I no longer have. I'll work it out.

45:00.987 --> 45:04.782
In the meantime, if there's anything
going on between you and Dr. Mikey...

45:04.865 --> 45:06.826
end it, immediately.

45:06.867 --> 45:08.327
Billy.

45:57.335 --> 45:58.836
Biff Quigley.

45:58.919 --> 46:03.341
Call me Biff. Mind telling me
why you want to know where they went?

46:04.675 --> 46:07.553
- Yes, Biff, I mind.
- Fine.

46:08.429 --> 46:09.764
Bill?

46:09.847 --> 46:11.932
A man's reasons ought to be his own.

46:12.016 --> 46:16.103
Good. Now, since we agree
on all that...

46:16.187 --> 46:19.732
But it's still going to cost you $800.

46:20.733 --> 46:24.236
- What?
- The info is a freebie.

46:25.196 --> 46:27.740
The $800 is for the info...

46:27.823 --> 46:31.869
I don't give your wife and doctor.

46:40.503 --> 46:42.421
Do you take travelers' checks?

47:25.673 --> 47:27.133
Gotcha.

47:33.139 --> 47:38.894
Come let the Gypsy king
guess your weight and tell your fate.

47:40.479 --> 47:41.939
Don't be shy.

47:42.023 --> 47:45.067
The old man, he knows everything.

47:46.944 --> 47:48.779
He can see everything.

47:48.863 --> 47:52.074
Don't bother
to step on the scale.

47:52.158 --> 47:54.869
I can tell your weight
from right here.

47:54.952 --> 47:58.748
159, right?

47:58.831 --> 48:00.499
And next week...

48:00.583 --> 48:03.419
gonna be 143.

48:03.502 --> 48:06.088
And the week after that...
Ooh!

48:06.172 --> 48:09.342
We don't like to think
about that, do we, mister?

48:14.889 --> 48:17.933
Sorry, mister, but you lose.

48:20.353 --> 48:21.771
But let's see.

48:27.068 --> 48:28.986
No.

48:34.075 --> 48:37.244
Ah, yes.

48:42.458 --> 48:45.294
You can have a prize anyway.

48:48.381 --> 48:50.299
Haaah!

48:51.092 --> 48:52.843
Haaah!

49:09.235 --> 49:11.737
Billy, get in, you idiot!

49:11.821 --> 49:13.531
Cary?

49:13.614 --> 49:15.324
Hey-ah!

49:23.791 --> 49:28.421
You ready, Billy? You and I
are gonna get that Gypsy bastard!

49:29.630 --> 49:31.048
What are you doing?

49:31.132 --> 49:35.052
I'm saving you, Billy.
Isn't that what you want?

49:49.066 --> 49:50.943
Hold on, partner!

50:23.851 --> 50:28.606
Leda, this is Billy Halleck.
Can I speak with Cary, please?

50:28.689 --> 50:33.110
Sorry, Billy. Cary can't come
to the phone right now.

50:33.235 --> 50:36.822
Yesterday he drove his Lincoln
into a gas truck.

50:36.906 --> 50:39.492
A happy ending of sorts.

50:39.575 --> 50:42.453
He always did want to be cremated.

50:45.748 --> 50:48.292
I'm sorry, Leda.

51:36.048 --> 51:38.509
Excuse me.
You seen this man?

51:39.593 --> 51:41.178
His name's Tadzu Lempke.

51:43.889 --> 51:45.308
Taddy Lempke?

51:52.231 --> 51:54.150
I knew he was around.

51:54.233 --> 51:56.986
- You know Lempke?
- How could you forget him?

51:57.069 --> 52:00.489
Big, black cancer
in the middle of his face.

52:00.573 --> 52:04.160
I hadn't seen him
since I worked the Ferris wheel...

52:04.243 --> 52:07.830
ten, maybe twenty years ago.

52:07.913 --> 52:11.334
But it was him last night.
You know what he said to me?

52:12.710 --> 52:15.254
"Hey, Flash.

52:15.338 --> 52:19.425
Where that pretty
little wife of yours?

52:20.760 --> 52:23.846
Well, don't matter.

52:23.929 --> 52:27.016
You'll see her soon. "

52:29.518 --> 52:32.647
Mister, my wife has been dead
for five years...

52:32.730 --> 52:34.774
and he knew it.

52:41.530 --> 52:45.117
Did you see which way the Gypsies went
when they left here?

52:45.201 --> 52:47.370
No, but I heard them.

52:47.453 --> 52:50.498
You can't miss the sound
of those old beaters they drive.

52:50.581 --> 52:54.001
Out 27, then north on 1.

52:57.880 --> 53:01.175
Listen. Thank you.

53:02.385 --> 53:04.345
Thank you very much.

53:07.056 --> 53:10.017
Mister, be careful.

53:10.101 --> 53:12.770
That Taddy will chew you up
and swallow you down.

53:17.900 --> 53:19.193
Yes?

53:21.237 --> 53:22.363
Linda.

53:22.446 --> 53:25.700
Daddy, where are you?
I've been so worried.

53:25.741 --> 53:28.619
It's good to hear your voice.
When did you get home?

53:28.703 --> 53:31.163
Yesterday.
Mom's really upset.

53:31.247 --> 53:33.624
Where is she now?

53:33.708 --> 53:36.043
She's in the kitchen
with Dr. Houston.

53:36.085 --> 53:38.296
What's Dr. Mikey doing there?

53:38.379 --> 53:42.174
- He's been here a lot. Why?
- Billy, is that you?

53:43.884 --> 53:47.138
Sweetheart, I've been talking to Mike,
and he's been saying that...

53:47.221 --> 53:49.307
Bitch! Bitch!

53:49.390 --> 53:52.143
This is all your fault, you bitch!

54:57.875 --> 55:00.086
For shame! My mama!

55:00.169 --> 55:03.005
I say you killed my own mama!

55:03.089 --> 55:06.801
I say you are a demon,
and we should kill you!

55:06.842 --> 55:11.973
Is that what I am to you?
A demon?

55:13.724 --> 55:15.309
Look at me.

55:28.239 --> 55:33.577
She call you
the white man from town.

55:34.704 --> 55:37.540
You got no business with us...

55:37.623 --> 55:40.293
and we got no business with you.

55:40.334 --> 55:43.087
- Go away.

55:43.170 --> 55:45.089
I'm not through with you.

55:46.299 --> 55:50.970
Your daughter ran out
between two parked cars.

55:51.053 --> 55:52.638
I couldn't see her.

55:52.722 --> 55:55.599
Why wasn't you watching,
white man from town?

55:55.683 --> 55:58.144
Why wasn't you watching?

55:58.227 --> 56:00.354
You never see us!

56:02.481 --> 56:04.817
- Cha!
- Fa!

56:05.901 --> 56:10.531
Doing this to me
won't bring your daughter back.

56:10.573 --> 56:13.492
Duncan Hopley is dead.

56:13.534 --> 56:15.661
So is Cary Rossington.

56:15.703 --> 56:17.830
Neither of them
brought your daughter back.

56:17.913 --> 56:22.835
Justice ain't about bringing
back the dead, white man.

56:22.918 --> 56:25.421
Justice is about justice!

56:25.504 --> 56:28.424
Your friends,
the policeman and the judge...

56:28.507 --> 56:31.886
make sure nothing happen to you,
they keep you safe.

56:31.927 --> 56:35.097
But I make sure
something happen to them.

56:35.181 --> 56:38.893
That justice, white man.
Gypsy justice.

56:38.976 --> 56:43.773
You know as much about justice
as I know about turbine engines.

56:43.856 --> 56:45.942
Now take your fucking curse
off of me!

56:51.530 --> 56:54.283
I never take it off.

56:54.367 --> 56:57.286
I die with it in me mouth.

57:09.757 --> 57:12.259
I'm sorry.
It was my fault.

57:12.343 --> 57:15.554
Please.
I'm asking you nicely.

57:15.596 --> 57:19.225
Take it off
before this goes any further.

57:19.308 --> 57:22.228
Get out or I make it worse.

57:22.311 --> 57:27.316
I make it so much worse,
you think I bless you the first time.

57:27.400 --> 57:28.901
Like this.

57:59.682 --> 58:01.767
Okay, I'll go...

58:01.851 --> 58:04.186
but not before I curse you...

58:05.855 --> 58:09.191
and everybody I see
by the light of this fire!

58:09.275 --> 58:11.819
The curse
of the white man from town!

58:30.963 --> 58:34.091
That's right, laugh.

58:34.175 --> 58:37.511
Laugh now, cry later...

58:37.553 --> 58:40.681
when this all is at your feet!

58:40.765 --> 58:43.684
You want to see what
the white man from town can do...

58:43.726 --> 58:46.562
when he puts his mind to it?

58:47.855 --> 58:49.690
Don't make me start, old man!

58:49.774 --> 58:52.026
Don't make me start!

58:52.068 --> 58:54.236
Take it off while you still can!

59:01.077 --> 59:04.705
Get out of here!
Leave this camp, murdering bastard!

59:22.431 --> 59:24.392
Look at this!

59:29.021 --> 59:32.066
The curse
of the white man from town...

59:34.318 --> 59:35.987
is on you, pal.

59:37.321 --> 59:41.075
They don't write about it in books,
but it is on you.

59:50.084 --> 59:51.919
This is Billy Halleck.

59:52.044 --> 59:54.714
- Can I speak to Richie Ginelli?
- Hold on.

59:57.508 --> 59:59.802
William.
How you doing, Counselor?

59:59.885 --> 01:00:03.806
Not so good, Richie.
I need a doctor.

01:00:03.889 --> 01:00:08.019
I'll have someone to you by morning.
Not a doctor, but he's pretty close.

01:00:17.111 --> 01:00:18.988
Ball bearing, huh?

01:00:22.575 --> 01:00:23.993
First for me.

01:00:27.288 --> 01:00:30.291
This kind of pain
is a first for me.

01:00:31.751 --> 01:00:34.295
There's a reason for that.

01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:39.634
I've worked with cadavers
that looked better than you do.

01:00:47.224 --> 01:00:51.187
These are mine,
but you need them more than I do.

01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:52.688
Potassium tablets.

01:00:55.816 --> 01:00:58.736
Will they do anything
for the pain?

01:00:58.819 --> 01:00:59.862
No.

01:01:00.947 --> 01:01:03.491
They'll prevent you
from going into cardiac arrest.

01:01:07.286 --> 01:01:11.999
Look, if it's a diet,
you can come off it now.

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:14.001
You have my permission.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.095
Expect a visitor tomorrow.

01:01:27.181 --> 01:01:29.266
Who?

01:01:29.350 --> 01:01:32.186
Take the Bufferin
and get some rest.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:22.570
You should have called me earlier,
Billy. A lot earlier.

01:02:22.653 --> 01:02:25.406
I didn't expect you
to come yourself.

01:02:25.448 --> 01:02:28.659
Hey, I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.960
Okay, I got it.

01:02:39.629 --> 01:02:41.047
Fuck.

01:02:42.131 --> 01:02:43.382
Fuck!

01:03:05.071 --> 01:03:06.489
Who was I kidding?

01:03:13.454 --> 01:03:18.000
You ever hear of something
called "committal in absentia"?

01:03:21.504 --> 01:03:23.172
Sure.

01:03:23.214 --> 01:03:28.010
It means somebody's committed to a
mental hospital without being examined.

01:03:28.052 --> 01:03:31.138
It's usually invoked when some guy
goes loony and runs off.

01:03:34.392 --> 01:03:35.851
Christ.

01:03:40.147 --> 01:03:43.025
Houston couldn't have done it
without Heidi.

01:03:45.194 --> 01:03:46.612
Damn them.

01:03:48.322 --> 01:03:50.324
Damn them both.

01:03:56.038 --> 01:03:58.541
Her and this doctor,
you don't think...

01:04:00.084 --> 01:04:02.086
Yeah. Sure.

01:04:03.421 --> 01:04:06.257
I didn't want to believe it...

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:09.844
until one night I saw his car
pulling out of the driveway.

01:04:11.387 --> 01:04:13.889
She said he just dropped by.

01:04:17.351 --> 01:04:21.731
Hey, relax.
You got nothing to worry about.

01:04:21.814 --> 01:04:25.443
By the time the order goes through,
this will either be over...

01:04:25.526 --> 01:04:27.820
or you'll be dead.

01:04:27.903 --> 01:04:33.159
If you make it, you can
deal with them at your leisure.

01:04:45.421 --> 01:04:49.508
I'm gonna get you for this, Heidi.

01:04:49.592 --> 01:04:52.178
I swear I am.

01:05:09.487 --> 01:05:11.697
Richie.

01:05:11.781 --> 01:05:15.409
You're not actually
gonna hurt anybody, are you?

01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:16.869
No.

01:05:16.953 --> 01:05:19.789
But, Billy, if I'm gonna help you...

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:22.708
you can't ask that question again.

01:05:40.393 --> 01:05:45.481
Hey, hey, hey.
What do you say, fellas?

01:05:45.564 --> 01:05:47.817
Do I smell like a gyp?

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:54.156
Who wants a little strychnine?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.409
Here you go.
Here you go.

01:06:43.205 --> 01:06:46.751
Hey, kid, wake up.
It's a visit from the money fairy.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.840
What's your name?

01:06:52.882 --> 01:06:55.635
Spurton. Frank Spurton.

01:06:57.303 --> 01:07:00.640
Okay, Frank Spurton.
Check it out.

01:07:16.072 --> 01:07:19.533
I don't do nothing
that goes on video.

01:07:19.617 --> 01:07:22.203
That's a good plan, Stan.

01:07:22.244 --> 01:07:26.874
Listen. There's some Gypsies
camped out up the road.

01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:29.794
They light, you call me.

01:07:34.548 --> 01:07:37.551
Who do I ask for
in case someone else answers?

01:07:37.635 --> 01:07:41.180
Don't worry.
I'll answer.

01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:09.250
- You like this, don't you?
- Like it? Are you kidding?

01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:11.585
I fuckin' love it!

01:08:17.758 --> 01:08:21.761
- Yeah.
- They're at a small farm off Route 92.

01:08:21.845 --> 01:08:23.764
I think they made me.

01:08:23.805 --> 01:08:27.518
If I were you, friend,
I'd get out of there as soon as I could.

01:08:27.602 --> 01:08:29.270
And lose my number.

01:08:56.671 --> 01:08:58.090
Thanks.

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.305
Well, well, well.

01:09:19.444 --> 01:09:20.863
Hey, Billy.

01:09:48.432 --> 01:09:51.810
I think it's time
for us to move on.

01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:02.822
- This is getting out of hand.
- Wrong.

01:10:02.905 --> 01:10:04.991
This has been out of hand...

01:10:05.074 --> 01:10:07.243
ever since that old gyp
touched you.

01:10:07.326 --> 01:10:11.455
I'm just the guy
to put it back "in hand. "

01:10:11.539 --> 01:10:14.458
I gotta show them
they can't get away with that stuff...

01:10:14.542 --> 01:10:17.003
they pulled on that kid.

01:10:17.086 --> 01:10:21.007
He was a mook,
but he was my mook.

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:23.009
Richie the Hammer.

01:10:24.343 --> 01:10:25.928
Please don't.

01:11:44.256 --> 01:11:45.883
There! Over there!

01:11:58.729 --> 01:12:00.231
No!

01:12:03.526 --> 01:12:05.444
Nooo!

01:12:08.781 --> 01:12:10.199
No!

01:12:11.409 --> 01:12:12.952
Gabe!

01:12:14.078 --> 01:12:17.540
No, Gabe!

01:12:18.457 --> 01:12:20.751
No!

01:12:42.607 --> 01:12:45.735
- Yes?
- F.B.I.

01:12:45.776 --> 01:12:50.740
Special Agent Stoner.
I have a few questions, Mrs. Grimani.

01:12:50.823 --> 01:12:53.159
Can you identify...

01:12:54.619 --> 01:12:58.039
That pig killed my old mama!

01:12:58.789 --> 01:13:01.917
- He killed my husband.
- Mr. William Halleck?

01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:04.503
Was it him
at this camp last night?

01:13:04.587 --> 01:13:09.425
No, but we believe he hired someone
to make the attack.

01:13:09.467 --> 01:13:11.427
We have him in custody.

01:13:11.469 --> 01:13:15.765
Would you mind accompanying me
to identify him personally?

01:13:30.112 --> 01:13:32.031
My God.

01:13:32.949 --> 01:13:34.367
Not again.

01:13:38.037 --> 01:13:39.997
He's waiting in the car.

01:13:46.837 --> 01:13:48.798
There is no car here.

01:13:48.839 --> 01:13:52.385
I almost forgot.

01:13:52.468 --> 01:13:56.389
I have a photo of the man we suspect
attacked your camp.

01:13:56.472 --> 01:13:57.515
It was you!

01:14:04.981 --> 01:14:06.482
Acid, bitch.

01:14:15.449 --> 01:14:17.868
You scream again,
and I'll kill you.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.416
You just got a face full
of soda pop and baking soda.

01:14:32.216 --> 01:14:33.718
Billy, get out!

01:14:38.472 --> 01:14:40.891
- Richie, no!

01:14:43.436 --> 01:14:46.480
This time you live
because my friend asks.

01:14:46.564 --> 01:14:49.859
Next time,
you're one dead little whore.

01:14:51.402 --> 01:14:53.362
Fuck you.
And fuck him!

01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.076
Now...

01:14:59.994 --> 01:15:04.915
here's the real deal.

01:15:11.922 --> 01:15:15.259
Now here's what I want you to do.

01:15:17.595 --> 01:15:21.557
Unless you want
to wear a Gypsy scarf...

01:15:21.641 --> 01:15:24.810
over your face
for the rest of your life...

01:15:26.395 --> 01:15:32.068
hold very still!

01:15:36.447 --> 01:15:39.492
Tell the old gyp to meet me
at the lighthouse in two hours.

01:16:12.692 --> 01:16:16.779
Your friend is a pig!
He will die thin!

01:16:16.862 --> 01:16:20.783
But you will die first,
you bastard!

01:16:35.298 --> 01:16:39.468
He'll meet you there in about an hour,
over by that bench.

01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:42.763
Thanks, Richie.

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:50.688
You want to thank me?
Get that old bastard.

01:17:29.518 --> 01:17:30.937
Wake up.

01:17:32.396 --> 01:17:33.689
Wake up.

01:17:39.612 --> 01:17:44.283
Your dreams smell bad to me.
They stink.

01:17:44.367 --> 01:17:47.828
Maybe you think
you're still dreaming, huh?

01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:59.548
Does this look like dream to you,
white man from town?

01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:03.511
You kill my daughter,
and you get off.

01:18:03.594 --> 01:18:07.223
For that you deserve to die,
so I curse you!

01:18:07.265 --> 01:18:12.061
But now, I got to do this
so your crazy friend...

01:18:12.103 --> 01:18:14.939
don't hurt my Galina.

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:19.735
Already he kill her husband.
You want your little girl hurt?

01:18:20.778 --> 01:18:24.115
I didn't want any of this.

01:18:24.198 --> 01:18:26.534
You want to get rid of the curse?

01:18:26.617 --> 01:18:29.662
First, you've got to give it...

01:18:29.745 --> 01:18:31.956
to this pie.

01:18:38.337 --> 01:18:42.842
Then you give this pie...

01:18:46.637 --> 01:18:50.683
With the curse inside,
to somebody else.

01:19:06.365 --> 01:19:07.491
Okay.

01:19:10.077 --> 01:19:13.539
You gain weight quick now.

01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:17.960
So quick, you don't know
what's going on.

01:19:18.002 --> 01:19:21.172
But somebody...

01:19:21.255 --> 01:19:24.717
got to eat this pie soon.

01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:29.055
Everyone who eat pie
die quick and bad.

01:19:29.722 --> 01:19:32.558
You got somebody?

01:19:32.642 --> 01:19:34.602
Yes.

01:19:34.685 --> 01:19:38.564
Yeah, you got somebody.

01:19:53.412 --> 01:19:58.209
But why you don't do right?
Eat your own pie.

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:01.379
You die thin,
but you die clean.

01:20:03.255 --> 01:20:05.424
Get away from me.

01:20:05.508 --> 01:20:07.969
Our business is done.

01:20:18.062 --> 01:20:22.275
Die clean, white man from town.

01:20:22.358 --> 01:20:24.360
Die clean.

01:20:36.247 --> 01:20:41.168
- Daddy, are you okay?
- I'm still thin, but I'll be fine.

01:20:41.210 --> 01:20:44.463
Listen.
Daddy's coming home tonight...

01:20:44.505 --> 01:20:46.424
but I want it to be a surprise, okay?

01:20:46.465 --> 01:20:48.259
Yeah. Sure.

01:20:48.342 --> 01:20:51.470
- I want you to stay at Georgia's.
- Daddy, no!

01:20:51.554 --> 01:20:53.889
Yes.

01:20:53.973 --> 01:20:55.433
There are some things...

01:20:55.516 --> 01:20:58.936
I need to talk
to your mother about.

01:20:58.978 --> 01:21:00.646
Promise you'll stay at Georgia's.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.732
- All right.
- Thanks, honey.

01:21:02.773 --> 01:21:04.692
Let me talk with your mother.

01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:08.613
Billy, is that you?

01:21:10.406 --> 01:21:13.409
There are some things I have to do
before I come home.

01:21:13.492 --> 01:21:15.494
I'll see you
in a couple of days.

01:22:04.418 --> 01:22:06.379
Wake up...

01:22:06.462 --> 01:22:10.841
white woman from town.

01:22:10.883 --> 01:22:13.094
Oh, Billy.

01:22:13.177 --> 01:22:14.512
Oh, Billy! Oh!

01:22:14.553 --> 01:22:17.848
Whoa. At least wait
until I get up to 140.

01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:20.434
I didn't expect you home
until the end of the week.

01:22:20.518 --> 01:22:23.604
I couldn't wait to see you.
I even brought you a present.

01:22:24.730 --> 01:22:26.732
It's on the kitchen counter.

01:22:26.774 --> 01:22:31.237
I know why you came home early.
I know what you've been thinking.

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.033
I swear there's never been anything
between Mike Houston and me.

01:22:36.075 --> 01:22:39.662
We can talk about it
in the morning.

01:22:39.745 --> 01:22:43.666
I'm gonna go upstairs.
I'm exhausted.

01:22:44.834 --> 01:22:46.669
All right.

01:22:48.754 --> 01:22:51.549
- I'm going with you.
- No, no.

01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:53.634
It's early.

01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:57.179
Why don't you check out
what I brought you?

01:22:57.263 --> 01:22:59.932
You're gonna like it.

01:23:00.016 --> 01:23:02.727
You sound like
your old silly self.

01:23:02.768 --> 01:23:05.271
I'm starting to feel
like my old silly self again.

01:23:05.354 --> 01:23:07.273
- Take a look.
- It's in there?

01:23:07.356 --> 01:23:08.774
Go. Go.

01:23:18.117 --> 01:23:20.036
Is it strawberry?

01:23:20.119 --> 01:23:21.579
Uh-huh.

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:24.582
Oh, Billy,
that's my favorite.

01:23:25.791 --> 01:23:27.251
I know.

01:23:32.298 --> 01:23:37.762
Getting even is also
what it's all about, you bitch.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:57.323
Heidi?

01:24:00.117 --> 01:24:02.119
Heidi.

01:24:03.329 --> 01:24:04.747
You awake?

01:24:11.671 --> 01:24:13.589
Did you try it?

01:24:20.179 --> 01:24:22.932
Yep. You tried it.

01:24:44.453 --> 01:24:46.706
Strawberry pie.

01:24:46.789 --> 01:24:48.833
Mmm.

01:24:54.463 --> 01:24:58.843
I wouldn't want to eat too much
of it myself, though.

01:24:58.884 --> 01:25:00.928
It's diet food.

01:25:14.775 --> 01:25:16.360
Look at you.

01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:21.449
Size six again.
Maybe even a size four.

01:26:06.827 --> 01:26:08.496
Daddy!

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:14.460
You look so thin,
but I'm glad to see you anyway.

01:26:16.921 --> 01:26:18.839
I'm sorry I didn't stay
at Georgia's...

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:22.301
but I needed to talk to Mom
before I saw you.

01:26:22.385 --> 01:26:24.387
Things haven't been great
between us...

01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:26.430
because of what
you've been going through.

01:26:26.514 --> 01:26:28.432
So I came back
after you went to sleep.

01:26:28.474 --> 01:26:30.601
We worked things out.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:33.771
And I just had a piece of your pie
for breakfast.

01:26:33.854 --> 01:26:36.440
- You had...
- Yes, Dad. It was delicious.

01:26:36.524 --> 01:26:39.986
And things are cool
between Mom and I.

01:26:40.069 --> 01:26:43.281
I have to play soccer with Lisa,
but I'll catch you later.

01:26:48.077 --> 01:26:49.495
Bye. Love you.

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:55.584
My God, what have I done?

01:27:25.531 --> 01:27:28.701
Billy, you're home.

01:27:28.784 --> 01:27:30.745
Dr. Mikey.

01:27:30.828 --> 01:27:33.539
Early for a house call, isn't it?

01:27:36.042 --> 01:27:38.002
It's not what you think.

01:27:39.670 --> 01:27:42.548
Heidi was upset.

01:27:42.632 --> 01:27:45.051
I just stopped by
to see how she was doing.

01:27:45.092 --> 01:27:49.680
Don't sweat it. I might have done
the same thing in your shoes.

01:27:49.722 --> 01:27:52.767
After all,
I was acting like a jerk.

01:27:52.850 --> 01:27:57.563
But I'm fine now.
Even put a little weight back on.

01:27:57.647 --> 01:28:00.775
I was just digging into a slice
of this breakfast pie.

01:28:00.858 --> 01:28:04.070
- Care to join me?
- I really shouldn't.

01:28:04.111 --> 01:28:08.574
Come on, Mike.
I've settled everything with Heidi.

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:12.453
Now it's your turn.
The pie's delicious.

01:28:12.536 --> 01:28:14.455
You sure I'm not intruding?

01:28:14.538 --> 01:28:16.082
Positive...

01:28:21.212 --> 01:28:23.589
white doctor from town.
