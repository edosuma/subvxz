What's this?

00:19.962 --> 00:21.795
Oh, yeah, this is
the "Profile in Courage" thing?

00:21.797 --> 00:23.797
Yeah, I saw that in the paper.
Congratulations.

00:23.799 --> 00:25.132
It's our ticket home.

00:25.134 --> 00:27.000
- Home?
- City Hall.

00:27.002 --> 00:28.335
I'm running again.

00:28.337 --> 00:29.836
I'm gonna kick
Spallone's ass

00:29.838 --> 00:31.638
or Chema or Martinelli
or whoever else

00:31.640 --> 00:33.256
the Republicans
wanna send at me.

00:33.258 --> 00:34.841
I was on the right side
of the housing

00:34.843 --> 00:36.726
and more and more
people see it.

00:37.813 --> 00:40.063
How you doing?

00:40.065 --> 00:41.264
I'm also hearing
that Vinni's

00:41.266 --> 00:42.766
gonna run for the new
council president post.

00:42.768 --> 00:45.268
And she polls really well
on the East Side,

00:45.270 --> 00:47.104
so I'm thinking
we tick it up with Vinni,

00:47.106 --> 00:48.905
- and then we just get in here--
- Nick, I'm--

00:48.907 --> 00:51.658
I'm committed to Zaleski.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.944
- Zaleski?
- Yeah.

00:55.114 --> 00:56.696
Terry fuckin' Zaleski?

00:56.698 --> 00:58.748
I helped recruit
and encourage him to run.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.835
He's the reform candidate
for the Democrats.

01:01.837 --> 01:03.620
You didn't check
with me first?

01:03.622 --> 01:05.455
Come, on, Jim, you knew
I was thinking about

01:05.456 --> 01:07.124
getting back
into this thing.

01:07.126 --> 01:11.178
Come on, Jim.

01:11.180 --> 01:13.430
You got
your start with me.

01:13.432 --> 01:16.133
For Christ's sake, you were my chief
of staff. Who's Terry Zaleski to you?

01:16.135 --> 01:18.685
Nick, I know he's only an assemblyman,
but he's got an East Side district,

01:18.687 --> 01:20.387
so he can carry
those precincts.

01:20.389 --> 01:22.522
Plus, he's pro-compliance
on the housing,

01:22.524 --> 01:24.357
but he's not identified
with it like you are.

01:24.359 --> 01:25.725
Or he's not
identified with it

01:25.727 --> 01:27.611
because he hid the hell up
in Albany in '88

01:27.613 --> 01:29.479
and stayed as far away
from Yonkers as he could.

01:29.481 --> 01:30.981
There's a lot
at stake here.

01:30.983 --> 01:32.482
This is gonna be
the first four-year term

01:32.484 --> 01:34.451
and strong mayor
in our lifetime,

01:34.453 --> 01:35.965
and we need the Democrat
with the best shot...

01:35.966 --> 01:36.487
Yeah, it's gonna be...

01:36.488 --> 01:37.461
...against whoever's coming
at us in the general.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.573
...the first strong mayor because
I got the charter amendment through,

01:39.575 --> 01:41.374
and you're gonna hand it
to Terry fuckin' Zaleski?

01:41.376 --> 01:43.326
No, no, no.
Jim, no.

01:43.328 --> 01:45.996
It's not a negative
for me anymore.

01:45.998 --> 01:48.215
I took
a courageous stand.

01:48.217 --> 01:50.217
I was the only one in the city
who did the right thing.

01:50.219 --> 01:52.302
Nick, courage
isn't the kind of word

01:52.304 --> 01:54.838
you can use to describe yourself
even if it's true.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.424
It works when
other people say it.

01:57.426 --> 01:59.342
Other people are saying it,
God damn it.

01:59.344 --> 02:00.393
Read the fucking letter.

02:00.395 --> 02:01.811
The city's still
too raw, Nick.

02:01.813 --> 02:03.480
They're not ready
for you again.

02:05.934 --> 02:09.485
- Fuck you, Jim.
- Oh, come on, Nick.

02:09.488 --> 02:12.606
Fuck you, I'm running
and I'm winning.

02:12.608 --> 02:14.191

02:33.428 --> 02:34.761
- Hey, watch your step.
- I'm good.

02:34.763 --> 02:38.048
- No, it's slippery.
- I'm good.

02:38.050 --> 02:40.517
Hey, what's the matter?

02:40.519 --> 02:42.219
- I just--
- Doll, you okay?

02:42.221 --> 02:43.687
It feels like there's--

02:45.390 --> 02:47.774
there's-- nothing's
ever finished,

02:47.776 --> 02:49.693
nothing's ever
accomplished.

02:51.563 --> 02:54.564
- I mean, you shovel the walk
and you shovel it again. - Right.

02:54.566 --> 02:56.783
I weed the garden
and I weed it again.

02:56.785 --> 03:00.737
We mow the lawn,
we mow it again.

03:00.739 --> 03:03.240
Uh-huh. Is this
about the house?

03:04.626 --> 03:06.576
We voted for Wasicsko
over Martinelli,

03:06.578 --> 03:09.212
because he said
he would fight for us.

03:09.214 --> 03:11.331
But he didn't really fight,
so we vote for Hank Spallone,

03:11.333 --> 03:12.999
who said he would
fight, but he...

03:14.586 --> 03:16.586
So he's up against Chema,

03:16.588 --> 03:18.922
who caved on
the consent decree vote,

03:18.924 --> 03:21.808
or Martinelli, who didn't fight
for us way back when.

03:21.810 --> 03:25.228
It just-- we keep
shoveling the same walk.

03:25.230 --> 03:26.813
It never ends.

03:28.317 --> 03:30.100
So it is about the house.

Is this enough manpower?

03:43.448 --> 03:45.165
Do you want
to spend more?

03:45.167 --> 03:47.117
Not if I can help it.

03:47.119 --> 03:49.286
Then it's enough.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.671
Based on my experience
up in Greenburgh,

03:51.673 --> 03:54.424
you'd be hard-pressed
to get HUD to fund any of me.

03:54.426 --> 03:56.209
They're about
the bricks and mortar.

03:56.211 --> 03:58.845
They have less interest
in building the people up.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.014
Well, I'll find the money.

04:01.016 --> 04:03.550
Oh, am I-- sorry
to disturb you.

04:03.552 --> 04:05.635
<i>No, no. Oscar,</i>
<i>please come in.</i>

04:05.637 --> 04:07.520
I want you to meet
Bob Mayhawk.

04:07.522 --> 04:09.306
I was telling you
about his program.

04:09.308 --> 04:11.691
- You're the consultant.
- As are you.

04:11.693 --> 04:15.528
I'm an admirer of most of what you've done
with these housing units.

04:15.530 --> 04:18.031
The emphasis on ownership

04:18.033 --> 04:21.201
and personal responsibility
is essential here.

04:21.202 --> 04:22.619
We're gonna
start with that.

04:22.621 --> 04:24.371
I'd better go
brief my team.

04:24.373 --> 04:26.239
The only thing
I'll need from you

04:26.241 --> 04:29.659
will be a list of the most vocal
opponents to the housing.

04:29.661 --> 04:32.295
- Opponents?
- <i> Not political people.</i>

04:32.297 --> 04:35.715
Homeowners.
The angrier the better.

04:35.717 --> 04:37.133
I'll have my office
work that up.

04:37.135 --> 04:40.553
Good. I'll go through them
in detail, pick our targets.

04:40.555 --> 04:43.056
- It's good to meet you, Mr. Newman.
- Same here.

04:47.846 --> 04:49.346
Most of what I've done?

04:52.484 --> 04:53.817
Hey, girl.

04:53.819 --> 04:56.436
I'm in here.

04:56.438 --> 04:58.104
How are you?

04:58.106 --> 04:59.239
Hey, where's
my little monster?

04:59.241 --> 05:01.024
I just put him
down for a nap.

05:01.026 --> 05:03.576
Oh, I'm just gonna go peek
on him and see in there.

05:03.578 --> 05:05.662
Uh, you wake him,
you take him.

05:08.283 --> 05:10.533
Where's Ma and Daddy?

05:10.535 --> 05:13.586
She's at the grocery store
and Daddy's at work.

05:13.588 --> 05:15.705
Where else?

05:15.707 --> 05:18.958
So, how you doin',
little sis?

05:20.262 --> 05:22.679
- I'm getting better.
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.681 --> 05:24.764
Feeling better.

05:24.766 --> 05:28.051
Not that they trust me to
go anywhere or do anything.

05:28.053 --> 05:31.888
I've been thinking,
maybe you and Jaron

05:31.890 --> 05:34.140
could come stay with me
at my apartment.

05:34.142 --> 05:35.692
I mean, if Ma and Daddy
see you all right,

05:35.694 --> 05:37.861
they gotta come round
to trusting you again.

05:37.863 --> 05:39.562
For real?

05:39.564 --> 05:41.781
I want you to come out
with me today.

05:41.783 --> 05:44.734
Meet a friend of mine
out of Dunbar Homes.

05:44.736 --> 05:47.070
- A friend?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.072 --> 05:49.456
When HUD talked to me,
I said your staff could do it.

05:49.458 --> 05:50.657
No.

05:50.659 --> 05:53.543
I mean, on paper
we're the City of Yonkers,

05:53.545 --> 05:57.630
the same city that fought
the housing for a decade.

05:57.632 --> 05:59.499
I mean, I'm white,
you're white,

05:59.501 --> 06:02.635
the whole damn city government's white,
in case you haven't noticed.

06:02.637 --> 06:05.922
Oscar, we're gonna need
somebody outside of this agency,

06:05.924 --> 06:08.641
somebody with standing
in their community.

06:08.643 --> 06:09.843
And he's your man?

06:09.845 --> 06:11.060
You may not want
to hear this,

06:11.062 --> 06:14.314
but your houses
are just houses.

06:14.316 --> 06:15.765
The people
we put in them

06:15.767 --> 06:17.484
are gonna matter
even more.

06:17.486 --> 06:21.237
Well, I'm not
a people person,

06:21.239 --> 06:23.606
or so it's been
said of me.

06:23.608 --> 06:26.609
But you may not
be wrong.

06:29.865 --> 06:32.449
<i>They say we're tenants.</i>
<i>We're not tenants.</i>

06:32.451 --> 06:35.335
We're residents,
a community.

06:35.337 --> 06:40.206
And calling them projects makes
me think of science projects.

06:40.208 --> 06:43.293
<i>We are not a project.</i>

06:43.295 --> 06:46.429
We are, I would think,
a complex or a development.

06:46.431 --> 06:47.964
- Amen!
- Right?

06:47.966 --> 06:49.766
<i>Low-income--</i>

06:49.768 --> 06:51.301
that's another phrase
we hear, too.

06:51.303 --> 06:53.937
But low-income
doesn't mean low class.

06:55.106 --> 06:56.639
See, the problem begins
with the language

06:56.641 --> 06:58.858
that gets used
with the assumptions

06:58.860 --> 07:01.444
that all the folks
in public housing are low,

07:01.446 --> 07:04.981
that all we wanna do
is just lay around and smoke drugs.

07:04.983 --> 07:08.151
- I live in public housing.
<i>- All right.</i>

07:08.153 --> 07:11.788
I live here, and I am nothing like
what they are describing.

07:11.790 --> 07:13.656
- That's right, now.
<i>- Amen! Amen!</i>

07:13.658 --> 07:16.075
You know, I never really trusted Surdoval.

07:16.077 --> 07:17.994
He's a little
too feral for me.

07:17.996 --> 07:20.163
Yeah, well, he's done
a hell of job

07:20.165 --> 07:21.548
orchestrating
all these phone calls

07:21.550 --> 07:23.633
from people telling me
they're gonna back Zaleski

07:23.635 --> 07:26.503
and that my running
would just split the vote.

07:26.505 --> 07:28.505
God damn it.

07:28.507 --> 07:31.841
Yeah, well, I mean,
Zaleski's a fresh slate, you know?

07:31.843 --> 07:33.927
He's a back-bench
state legislator

07:33.929 --> 07:36.312
that no one knows
enough to dislike.

07:36.314 --> 07:38.481
It's not fair,
but it makes sense.

07:38.483 --> 07:40.767
I've got the press
waiting for me to announce,

07:40.769 --> 07:42.902
I've got everybody primed.

07:42.904 --> 07:44.988
I'm fucking twisting here.

07:44.990 --> 07:47.190
All right, look.

07:47.192 --> 07:49.025
If it were me,
this is what I'd do.

07:49.027 --> 07:50.693
I'd take it
one step at a time.

07:50.695 --> 07:52.529
Grab Chema's
council seat

07:52.531 --> 07:54.197
now that he's
throwing in for mayor.

07:54.199 --> 07:56.533
And from there,
you're in the game.

07:56.535 --> 07:58.835
You either run the Democrats
on the council

07:58.837 --> 08:00.537
and share credit
with Zaleski--

08:00.539 --> 08:02.372
Or if Zaleski's
a lousy mayor,

08:02.374 --> 08:03.923
I'm an everyday thorn
in his side.

08:03.925 --> 08:06.960
Yeah. I know.
I thought about that.

08:06.962 --> 08:08.962
Well, what does Nay say?

08:10.682 --> 08:13.800
You know she's always got my back
no matter what I do.

08:13.802 --> 08:16.803
She's always
on my side...

08:16.805 --> 08:18.721
which is why I wanted
to talk to you about this.

08:20.058 --> 08:21.608
Why, I'm not on your side?

08:21.610 --> 08:23.226
- No--
- How long have we known each other?

08:23.228 --> 08:25.895
- You say that--
- I'm just saying. I'm just saying.

08:28.984 --> 08:31.401
So you...

08:31.403 --> 08:33.035
out of it
for four years,

08:33.038 --> 08:35.488
now you're throwing your hat in
for council president?

08:35.490 --> 08:37.573
Why now?

08:37.576 --> 08:38.741
I don't know.
I mean, I think I have

08:38.743 --> 08:41.244
enough name recognition
to run citywide.

08:41.246 --> 08:42.912
The field is weak.

08:42.914 --> 08:45.081
Farmer's gonna have
trouble on the East Side,

08:45.083 --> 08:47.584
and Jack O'Toole's
a write-in joke.

08:47.586 --> 08:49.052
You're getting
better at this.

08:53.925 --> 08:56.092
- Mm.
- Really, you are.

08:59.648 --> 09:01.314
So what are you gonna do?

09:01.316 --> 09:04.267
I don't know.

09:04.269 --> 09:07.403
I think I need to look
Terry Zaleski in the eyes.

09:07.405 --> 09:08.821
Yeah.

09:12.827 --> 09:14.444
Not like we can
stop you,

09:14.446 --> 09:16.746
but you've seen
how these drugs do.

09:16.748 --> 09:19.115
And if you got
another way...

09:19.117 --> 09:22.251
I'm stronger now.

09:22.253 --> 09:24.420
And if I'm not,
then hiding here or New Jersey

09:24.422 --> 09:26.039
ain't gonna help.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.458
Schlobohm ain't no place
to raise no child,

09:28.460 --> 09:29.592
especially alone.

09:32.097 --> 09:34.180
You need to trust me some.

09:39.604 --> 09:42.305
Yeah.

09:45.310 --> 09:47.026
What the fuck?

09:50.649 --> 09:52.365
Yeah, kiddo.

09:52.367 --> 09:54.651
That's gonna be you
in a few years, baby.

09:54.653 --> 09:57.370
Hot, I heard
you was back.

09:57.372 --> 09:59.322
Yeah, just got home.

09:59.324 --> 10:00.707
You seen my son?

10:00.709 --> 10:02.992
Little shorty here?
Ain't no stranger to me and Meeka.

10:04.412 --> 10:06.746
So, what you moving back?
Building Seven?

10:06.748 --> 10:08.247
Yeah,
that's the plan, yo.

10:08.249 --> 10:11.084
Got hisself a grocery job, too.

10:11.086 --> 10:12.502
<i>Aw, damn.</i>

10:12.504 --> 10:14.804
Homeboy going
all Huxtable and shit.

10:14.806 --> 10:16.756
Fuck you, Meeka.

10:19.394 --> 10:22.345
Why you gotta put my shit
in the street about the grocery store?

10:25.150 --> 10:26.849
What's the problem, bro?

10:30.739 --> 10:33.156
Come on, baby.

10:34.526 --> 10:36.826
For the good of the party,
we cannot afford

10:36.828 --> 10:38.194
to lose City Hall
this year.

10:38.196 --> 10:40.697
First time to elect
a strong mayor in 50 years.

10:40.699 --> 10:43.533
But I'm the one with the experience
that we're gonna need.

10:43.535 --> 10:44.751
And I think
that people know that.

10:44.753 --> 10:46.202
Nick, people have
long memories,

10:46.204 --> 10:48.871
especially in this town,
and that housing mess,

10:48.873 --> 10:50.039
it's still too fresh.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.708
Well, look,
Spallone's made it--

10:51.710 --> 10:53.376
Spallone?
Really?

10:53.378 --> 10:55.428
You and Spallone again?

10:55.430 --> 10:59.382
No, people want to put the housing
behind them and forget about it.

10:59.384 --> 11:01.768
I don't have the taint of all that.

11:01.770 --> 11:03.970
On the other hand,
quite frankly,

11:03.972 --> 11:06.105
you're the face
of the entire ugly mess.

11:07.892 --> 11:09.609
But you don't need
this right now.

11:09.611 --> 11:11.194
It's too much.

11:12.731 --> 11:14.230
You and Nick are young.

11:14.232 --> 11:16.899
You're newlyweds,
just starting your lives together.

11:16.901 --> 11:18.284
Terry and I are older.

11:18.286 --> 11:21.404
We've got it
all mapped out.

11:21.406 --> 11:23.156
You have
what mapped out?

11:23.158 --> 11:25.124
Life, career,
you know.

11:27.162 --> 11:29.712
We're not gonna be
in Yonkers for long.

11:29.714 --> 11:32.498
- Oh--
- We look toward a congressional run,

11:32.500 --> 11:34.333
which will
necessitate a move.

11:34.335 --> 11:36.469
And then maybe
Albany after that.

11:36.471 --> 11:38.721
We have a clear idea
of the future.

11:38.723 --> 11:40.389
You guys are
just starting out.

11:40.391 --> 11:42.258
- Right.
<i>- But we need to be united here.</i>

11:42.260 --> 11:44.811
Listen to reason.
Don't do this now.

11:44.813 --> 11:46.262
<i>We'll take care of you.</i>

11:46.264 --> 11:48.815
You can have any position
in my administration.

11:48.817 --> 11:50.900
Deputy mayor,

11:50.902 --> 11:53.603
commissioner,
anything you like.

11:53.605 --> 11:56.439
And if you do decide
to run for mayor down the road,

11:56.441 --> 11:58.241
you still have
all the time in the world.

11:58.243 --> 11:59.859
But not this time.

11:59.861 --> 12:01.327
Here you are, honey.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.695
We need to be united,
Nick.

12:19.097 --> 12:22.715
- Yes?
- Mrs. Mary Dorman?

12:22.717 --> 12:26.469
I'm pleased to meet you.
My name is Bob Mayhawk.

12:26.471 --> 12:27.887
You've been
recommended by someone

12:27.889 --> 12:30.306
who thought you would be perfect
for a community project

12:30.308 --> 12:32.475
to which
I'm presently attached.

12:34.062 --> 12:37.029
It's about
the public housing.

12:37.031 --> 12:39.398
I'd appreciate it if you'd hear me out
on the matter.

12:42.237 --> 12:44.821
Oh.

12:44.823 --> 12:47.623
Yes, uh...

12:47.625 --> 12:50.209
- Uh, won't you come in, mister...
- Mayhawk.

12:50.211 --> 12:52.829
Mr. Mayhawk, yes.

12:52.831 --> 12:54.664
Thank you.

12:58.086 --> 12:59.669
Um, sure, please.

13:03.508 --> 13:06.759
As I began to explain,
I run a group called

13:06.761 --> 13:09.478
the Housing Education
Relocation Enterprise,

13:09.480 --> 13:11.180
or HERE.

13:11.182 --> 13:14.233
We've been commissioned
by the Yonkers Housing Authority

13:14.235 --> 13:16.853
to help these tenants
move into the new homes.

13:16.855 --> 13:18.604
Thank you.

13:18.606 --> 13:20.523
And to do so
in the best possible way

13:20.525 --> 13:24.694
for the tenants and for the existing
neighborhood residents.

13:24.696 --> 13:26.195
Mmm.

13:26.197 --> 13:30.199
We intend to make sure
that what is going to happen,

13:30.201 --> 13:32.752
happens in the best
possible way for everyone.

13:34.756 --> 13:36.539
May I ask,
Mrs. Dorman,

13:36.541 --> 13:39.876
how do you feel about
the housing presently?

13:39.878 --> 13:41.677
Honestly?

13:41.679 --> 13:44.430
But of course.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.433
Honestly, I don't--
I don't believe in it.

13:47.435 --> 13:50.052
You don't believe
in the purpose of the housing,

13:50.054 --> 13:52.438
or you don't believe that the housing
is coming to your neighborhood?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.724
I don't believe
in the idea of it.

13:54.726 --> 13:56.726
I know the housing
is coming.

13:56.728 --> 13:59.228
It is.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.813
Oh, pardon me.

14:00.815 --> 14:03.065
You are exactly right.

14:03.067 --> 14:05.234
It is going to happen.

14:06.454 --> 14:10.072
And what is left
for all of us to decide

14:10.074 --> 14:12.658
is exactly
what it will be.

14:12.660 --> 14:16.212
Or, more importantly perhaps,
what it will not be.

14:18.583 --> 14:21.133
Yeah, you know, I won't
deny that I looked hard

14:21.135 --> 14:22.752
at another run for mayor.

14:22.754 --> 14:25.671
I think time
has made clear

14:25.673 --> 14:27.056
that we chose
the correct course

14:27.058 --> 14:28.891
in regards
to the housing issue,

14:28.893 --> 14:30.476
and in that sense,
I feel that Yonkers

14:30.478 --> 14:33.062
was ready to reconsider
my leadership.

14:33.064 --> 14:35.765
Nick, if you'd have won
the Profile in Courage Award,

14:35.767 --> 14:38.651
would your hat be
in the ring for mayor?

14:38.653 --> 14:40.937
Well, uh...

14:40.939 --> 14:43.522
what do the stars
and starlets always say?

14:43.524 --> 14:45.074
"It's an honor
just to be nominated"?

14:46.411 --> 14:49.078
But, no.
Here, look.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.947
It's not about
any award, you know.

14:50.949 --> 14:52.615
It's about the future
of the city.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.417
<i>Nick, was
this a sudden decision?</i>

14:54.419 --> 14:55.751
I mean,
we came here today

14:55.753 --> 14:58.421
expecting to hear your
formal announcement for mayor.

14:58.423 --> 15:02.091
Yeah, well, Maury,
I've been agonizing

15:02.093 --> 15:04.543
that a split would weaken
the general effort,

15:04.545 --> 15:06.796
so it's time
to come together.

15:06.798 --> 15:08.431
Mr. Zaleski, do you think

15:08.433 --> 15:12.101
a Wasicsko endorsement
boosts your candidacy?

15:12.103 --> 15:13.602
I think people
expected the Democrats

15:13.604 --> 15:16.389
to be scattered,
and now that's not so.

15:16.391 --> 15:19.191
Nick, are you going to be working
on behalf of the assemblyman?

15:19.193 --> 15:21.360
Full-time.

15:21.362 --> 15:23.479
I'll be working
with the Zaleski campaign

15:23.481 --> 15:25.147
full-time as well
as my own efforts

15:25.149 --> 15:27.650
to return to the council
of the Second District.

15:27.652 --> 15:30.987
So you're gonna run
for a council seat instead of mayor?

15:30.989 --> 15:33.990
Yeah. Well, with a Democratic
mayor and council president,

15:33.992 --> 15:36.625
I look forward
to being part of a team,

15:36.627 --> 15:41.831
a time of real progress
for the City of Yonkers.

15:41.833 --> 15:44.166
<i>Mr. Zaleski, how
do you see your chances,</i>

15:44.168 --> 15:48.137
<i>given the Republican candidate's
higher name recognition?</i>

15:48.139 --> 15:50.973
I think the people know
and are confident

15:50.975 --> 15:52.842
in the reform that I can bring
to city government.

16:06.974 --> 16:08.190
All right, what aboutow
our poll watchers?

16:08.226 --> 16:09.725
What do their numbers
look like?

16:09.727 --> 16:11.810
<i>His term of office
will be four years instead of...</i>

16:11.862 --> 16:14.196
All right. All right, call me
when you got something.

16:14.232 --> 16:17.149
Okay, but what about
that Radford Street polling place?

16:17.201 --> 16:18.317
Still nothing?

16:18.369 --> 16:19.451
Well, I haven't
seen anything

16:19.487 --> 16:21.370
from the Fourth
and Eighth Wards either.

16:21.405 --> 16:23.405
<i>Looks like</i>
<i>we have some new numbers.</i>

16:23.457 --> 16:26.709
With 86% of the election
districts reporting,

16:26.744 --> 16:28.711
Democrat Terry Zaleski
is leading

16:28.746 --> 16:30.246
with 38% of the vote,

16:30.248 --> 16:32.248
<i>trailed by Republican...</i>

16:32.250 --> 16:34.300
Hey, it's me again.
What do you got?

16:38.089 --> 16:41.140
Shit, are you kidding me?
Seventh Ward returns are in.

16:41.175 --> 16:44.643
Magilton's ahead 150 votes,
Chema's carrying those two.

16:44.679 --> 16:46.011
<i>Fuck!</i>

16:46.063 --> 16:47.429
Right, right, right.
Okay, no.

16:47.431 --> 16:49.598
That's-- that's a district
around Nodine Hill.

16:49.650 --> 16:52.101
That's where he lives,
so, no, I get it.

16:52.103 --> 16:53.736
Nay, could you
do something, please?

16:53.771 --> 16:56.071
Can you just call the elections board and
get me some better numbers,

16:56.107 --> 16:57.856
'cause I can't lose
another fucking election, okay?

16:57.908 --> 16:59.525
Calm down.

16:59.577 --> 17:01.026
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I'm not yelling at you.</i>

17:01.078 --> 17:04.246
Joke.
Sorry.

17:04.281 --> 17:07.165
<i>Okay, I understand</i>
<i>there are new developments.</i>

17:07.201 --> 17:09.167
<i>We have a crew</i>
<i>standing by live.</i>

17:09.203 --> 17:12.288
So, now we'll be going to
Martinelli campaign headquarters,

17:12.290 --> 17:15.290
where the former mayor
is now addressing supporters.

17:15.292 --> 17:17.710
I wanna thank everybody
who volunteered

17:17.762 --> 17:21.463
not only for this campaign,
but for all my campaigns.

17:21.464 --> 17:25.184
- <i> It has been a real honor</i>
<i>to serve six terms.</i> - Oy vey.

17:29.473 --> 17:31.106
Thank you so much.

17:31.142 --> 17:33.359
You gave it
one last run, Angelo.

17:33.394 --> 17:35.561
- I did, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.479
- Good try, Ange.
- Thank you.

17:37.481 --> 17:39.815
Well, I always say,

17:39.817 --> 17:42.117
what is meant to be
is meant to be.

17:42.153 --> 17:44.653
In this case,
it was meant to be

17:44.655 --> 17:47.489
that I suck enough votes away
from that squirrel Chema

17:47.491 --> 17:49.158
to finish
the son of a bitch.

17:50.795 --> 17:52.661
And although we gave it
our best shot,

17:52.713 --> 17:54.663
Terence Zaleski did
just a little bit better.

17:54.665 --> 17:56.999
Yeah, all those chickenshit votes, Pete.
Look at you now.

17:57.051 --> 18:00.002
<i>A few moments ago, I called
Terence Zaleski to congratulate him.</i>

18:00.054 --> 18:01.887
Yeah?

18:01.922 --> 18:03.555
Okay, Fourth and Eighth Wards
are coming in now,

18:03.591 --> 18:04.890
so this should
be better, right?

18:04.925 --> 18:06.925
<i>- We ran a good campaign.</i>
- All right.

18:06.977 --> 18:10.095
Yeah, no.
I got it, thanks.

18:10.147 --> 18:12.147
Hey!

18:12.183 --> 18:13.682
It's really close, Nick.

18:13.734 --> 18:16.685
- It's gonna be a few votes either way.
- He doesn't care.

18:16.737 --> 18:18.432
What wards do you got?
You got Fourth and Eighth?

18:18.433 --> 18:19.218
Yeah, complete.

18:19.253 --> 18:21.607
Okay, let me--
I'm gonna call you back.

18:21.659 --> 18:24.243
Yeah, 'cause in my head, even after
the Fourth and Eighth Wards come in,

18:24.278 --> 18:26.995
I'm still down
like 40 votes, right?

18:27.031 --> 18:29.698
Fuck, 40 votes.
Shit.

18:29.700 --> 18:32.618
Okay.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.453
So maybe I'm about
to get knocked off

18:34.505 --> 18:37.923
from my own council seat by some fool that
works for the Department of Public Works

18:37.958 --> 18:40.509
and is running for office
for the first time in his life.

18:40.544 --> 18:42.628
That's not such a good night.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.179
<i>Thank you all.
Thank you, Jim.</i>

18:44.215 --> 18:45.464
<i>Zaleski looks happy.</i>

18:45.516 --> 18:49.268
For the first time in 50 years,
we have a strong mayor.

18:52.273 --> 18:53.722
This should have
been you, Nicky.

18:53.774 --> 18:55.724
The only reason
he's mayor is because

18:55.776 --> 18:57.893
you stepped aside
for the good of the party.

18:57.945 --> 19:00.279
- Oh, yeah, Ma, is that why?
<i>- Vinni Restiano!</i>

19:00.314 --> 19:03.732
Is that why I did it,
for the good of the party?

19:04.952 --> 19:07.653
I mean, here-- here I am,

19:07.705 --> 19:11.540
waiting for the last returns
to carry my own home district.

19:11.575 --> 19:14.576
What makes me think
I could've beat Zaleski

19:14.578 --> 19:16.462
or any of these guys?

19:16.497 --> 19:18.547
40 votes is nothing, Nick.
You can make that up.

19:18.582 --> 19:21.800
Mike's right, the absentee ballots
are gonna favor you.

19:23.254 --> 19:26.255
Yeah, right.
Okay.

19:27.758 --> 19:30.726
Let's go salvage "whatsever" left,
all right?

19:31.846 --> 19:33.429
Deputy mayor at least.

19:33.481 --> 19:36.231
I can lick Zaleski's shoes
for the next four years.

19:36.267 --> 19:38.100
Come on, let's go.

19:48.612 --> 19:50.195
There he is.

19:58.923 --> 20:00.172
- Nick!
- Hey.

20:00.174 --> 20:01.590
I am back!

20:01.592 --> 20:03.292
They put me
out to pasture,

20:03.294 --> 20:06.178
but I found my way back
to the fuckin' barn!

20:06.180 --> 20:07.713
I'm really glad
for you, Vinni.

20:07.715 --> 20:09.348
Oh, shit!

20:09.350 --> 20:11.884
The last time I checked,
you were up a few hundred votes--

20:11.886 --> 20:13.469
No, I'm down
a few dozen now,

20:13.471 --> 20:15.604
so it's gonna come down
to a recount, but...

20:15.606 --> 20:17.139
maybe the absentee ballots.

20:17.141 --> 20:18.807
Absentees
will favor you, Nicky.

20:18.809 --> 20:20.309
You know this.

20:20.311 --> 20:22.478
- Nay, honey, do not let him get down.
- I won't.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.279
You know,
he'll squeeze this one out.

20:24.281 --> 20:25.531
- We will.
- Don't worry.

20:25.533 --> 20:28.150
- Congrats, Vinni.
- Thanks. I just-- Donny!

20:28.152 --> 20:29.818
<i>Come on, Angela.
You ready to vote?</i>

20:31.455 --> 20:33.155
The reason
is my message of reform.

20:33.157 --> 20:35.574
- Terry, hey.
- And I think...

20:35.576 --> 20:37.960
<i>the voters</i>
<i>responded to that.</i>

20:43.801 --> 20:46.251
<i>Only six!</i>

20:49.340 --> 20:50.923
<i>...votes counted.</i>

20:50.925 --> 20:53.392
<i>Terry Zaleski, a state
assemblyman who is certainly</i>

20:53.394 --> 20:55.844
<i>not as well-known</i>
<i>as his two main opponents,</i>

20:55.846 --> 20:57.679
<i>appears to be</i>
<i>the new mayor of Yonkers,</i>

20:57.681 --> 21:00.849
<i>having captured</i>
<i>30% of the vote.</i>

21:00.851 --> 21:03.185
<i>One of his
opponents, Angelo Martinelli...</i>

21:03.187 --> 21:06.071
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mr. New York Times.

21:06.073 --> 21:08.941
You're still a tough man
to track down, even on election night.

21:08.943 --> 21:12.110
- Got a smoke?
- It's my last one.

21:12.112 --> 21:13.278
What do you still
want from me?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.413
I'm not even
on the ballot tonight.

21:14.415 --> 21:15.914
Pete Chema saw to that.

21:15.916 --> 21:18.200
Mm.
Yeah, he did.

21:18.202 --> 21:21.753
And Zaleski sought
to beat Chema, didn't he?

21:21.755 --> 21:24.039
Do you see tonight
as a repudiation

21:24.041 --> 21:26.124
of your anti-housing
position

21:26.126 --> 21:28.377
to have Zaleski
and the Democrats win?

21:28.379 --> 21:30.762
What repudiation?

21:30.764 --> 21:34.099
You fought the housing,
you lost.

21:34.101 --> 21:36.218
The guys willing to build
the housing have won.

21:38.055 --> 21:39.888
Care to comment,
Mr. Mayor?

21:43.978 --> 21:45.394
Verna, can you
find the remote,

21:45.396 --> 21:47.396
see if the game's
still on?

21:56.290 --> 21:59.575
I don't care
what anyone says, Hank.

21:59.577 --> 22:01.710
I'm gonna miss
having you around.

22:08.335 --> 22:11.003
<i>Let's go back to
the council races for a second.</i>

22:11.005 --> 22:12.554
<i>Were one of the reasons...</i>

22:12.556 --> 22:13.672
- Hi, Phil.
- Hi.

22:13.674 --> 22:15.007
Hi, La Toya.
I just want to know--

22:15.009 --> 22:17.759
are you estranged from all
the members of your family,

22:17.761 --> 22:19.511
or are you friends...

22:19.513 --> 22:21.096
<i>with any of the members</i>
<i>of your family?</i>

22:21.098 --> 22:22.731
<i>She asked
earlier do we get along.</i>

22:22.733 --> 22:24.983
<i>We get along very well</i>
<i>with the members of my family.</i>

22:24.985 --> 22:27.185
<i>However, at the moment,</i>
<i>I haven't spoken...</i>

22:27.187 --> 22:28.987
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:28.989 --> 22:31.273
Any word from
the Board of Elections?

22:31.275 --> 22:33.275
Nope, nothing.

22:33.277 --> 22:34.776
Not even a rumor.

22:34.778 --> 22:36.945
And Zaleski hasn't
called me yet either.

22:36.947 --> 22:38.447
No "thank you
for your support,"

22:38.449 --> 22:39.831
or "couldn't have
done it without you"

22:39.833 --> 22:43.285
or "hang in there"
or "go fuck yourself," nothing.

22:44.538 --> 22:46.455
Well, anybody else
call today?

22:46.457 --> 22:47.923
Yeah, a couple people.

22:49.627 --> 22:51.927
But how about
that fuckin' Zaleski?

22:53.681 --> 22:56.682
I sacrifice for the guy
and he can't even pick up the phone.

22:56.684 --> 22:58.383
I mean, come on.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.386
Where was the count
last night?

23:01.388 --> 23:02.971
Is that still
where we are?

23:02.973 --> 23:04.690
Every count's
a roller coaster.

23:04.692 --> 23:08.310
I'm up 30, and then I'm down 40,
and I'm up two.

23:08.312 --> 23:10.362
They haven't counted
the absentee ballots yet, though.

23:10.364 --> 23:12.030
As long as they're
still counting.

23:12.032 --> 23:14.316
No, I blew it, Nay.

23:14.318 --> 23:15.367
I'm not gonna
pull this one out,

23:15.369 --> 23:18.120
and you know the rule--
you lose twice in a row,

23:18.122 --> 23:19.955
you're done.

23:19.957 --> 23:21.823
<i>You can't run again</i>
<i>without looking like an idiot.</i>

23:21.825 --> 23:23.408
<i>Nobody will take</i>
<i>you seriously.</i>

23:23.410 --> 23:25.043
You haven't lost.

23:25.045 --> 23:27.713
That is not true, okay?
It's gonna work out.

23:27.715 --> 23:29.631
My own fucking council district.

23:29.633 --> 23:30.666
What a embarrassment.

23:32.169 --> 23:35.137
Jesus Christ, Nick,
get it together, please.

23:35.139 --> 23:37.089
They're still
counting votes.

23:40.010 --> 23:41.977
And that I will faithfully
discharge the duties

23:41.979 --> 23:44.146
of the office of council member,
District 2.

23:44.148 --> 23:46.682
According to the city charter
and to the best of my ability.

23:46.684 --> 23:49.017
According to the city charter
and to the best of my ability.

23:49.019 --> 23:51.019
For and in
the City of Yonkers.

23:51.021 --> 23:52.821
For and in
the City of Yonkers.

23:52.823 --> 23:55.607
- Congratulations, Councilman.
- Thank you.

23:55.609 --> 23:58.026
- Better late than never.
- Thank you, Aloysius.

23:58.028 --> 23:59.861
All you have to do now
is sign the book.

23:59.863 --> 24:01.363
Yeah.

24:01.365 --> 24:03.281
Congrats,
Mr. Minority Leader.

24:03.283 --> 24:05.250
Thank you,
Mr. Majority Leader.

24:05.252 --> 24:08.253
26 votes, 26,000--
a win's still a win.

24:08.255 --> 24:09.838
Yeah, well...

24:09.840 --> 24:12.340
you know, I had this calculated
to a seven-vote win

24:12.342 --> 24:15.377
or six if the old man on Linden Street
got sick and stayed home again.

24:15.379 --> 24:17.379
So 26 votes
is a landslide.

24:17.381 --> 24:19.214
To tell you the truth,
you fooled me, Nick.

24:19.216 --> 24:21.049
I thought you'd run
for mayor.

24:21.051 --> 24:23.218
Hell, John,
maybe I fooled myself.

24:29.943 --> 24:32.894
All right.

24:42.790 --> 24:45.040
Welcome,
Mrs. Dorman.

24:45.042 --> 24:46.408
Please,
have a seat.

24:57.171 --> 25:01.339
Consider the watering hole
on the African veld

25:01.341 --> 25:05.677
where all
the great herds gather--

25:05.679 --> 25:08.764
the zebra,
the giraffe,

25:08.766 --> 25:12.067
the gnu,
the wildebeest--

25:12.069 --> 25:15.904
and the predators
that prey upon them--

25:15.906 --> 25:18.356
the lion, the cheetah.

25:18.358 --> 25:21.943
Imagine for one moment

25:21.945 --> 25:25.831
that there's a race
to that water.

25:27.034 --> 25:30.168
It's been a long,
hot summer.

25:32.623 --> 25:34.923
Ain't enough I'm in Schlobohm...

25:36.460 --> 25:39.628
- Go on.
- Why the hell am I doing this?

25:39.630 --> 25:41.513
You always want
to be taking?

25:41.515 --> 25:44.466
When are you gonna
start giving back?

25:44.468 --> 25:46.434
Let me put it
another way.

25:46.436 --> 25:49.137
Why don't you sign that
before I come over there

25:49.139 --> 25:51.473
and bang you in the side
of your hard head?

25:55.395 --> 25:57.445
- All right.
- Uh-huh.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.451
What do you think about
us going to the projects?

26:03.453 --> 26:05.821
You-- wait, do you think
it's safe for us?

26:06.957 --> 26:08.573
Oh, forget about it.

26:08.575 --> 26:11.042
I grew up in public housing
on Martin Ray Place,

26:11.044 --> 26:13.662
over where
the senior living is now.

26:13.664 --> 26:15.380
Well, it was
army barracks, really,

26:15.382 --> 26:18.500
for the veterans
coming back from the war.

26:18.502 --> 26:19.634
Of course,
back then,

26:19.636 --> 26:21.753
we took care
of our apartments.

26:21.755 --> 26:24.172
We didn't trash
the buildings.

26:24.174 --> 26:25.924
We were white.

26:29.930 --> 26:33.398
- You know, you like metaphor and simile...
- Thank you.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.483
...and you're partial
to parable, too.

26:35.485 --> 26:38.653
And allegory.
Don't forget allegory.

26:40.023 --> 26:42.741
What are you trying to give
them with all those stories?

26:42.743 --> 26:44.993
Stuff they can give
to their residents.

26:44.995 --> 26:48.280
The mysteries of life,
keys to the universe.

26:48.282 --> 26:51.366
Special weapons
that they can believe they possess

26:51.368 --> 26:53.201
that will keep them
confident.

26:53.203 --> 26:55.337
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:55.339 --> 26:58.006
And what are the keys
to the universe?

26:58.008 --> 27:01.376
I have no idea.
Do you?

27:01.378 --> 27:03.461
But before we're done,

27:03.463 --> 27:06.882
they'll believe
they have a few of them.

27:06.884 --> 27:08.550
And isn't that
the point?

27:17.611 --> 27:19.945
Do you think that
we could get started?

27:26.787 --> 27:28.653
Well, I guess
no one else is coming,

27:28.655 --> 27:31.706
so I think
we can get started.

27:34.244 --> 27:36.828
This being my first meeting
as tenant representative,

27:36.830 --> 27:39.464
I wanted to talk about
my idea for a resident-run

27:39.466 --> 27:41.383
day care center
here at Schlobohm.

27:41.385 --> 27:43.084
I think it could really--

27:45.305 --> 27:46.888
Yes?

27:46.890 --> 27:49.758
They still ain't fixed my
closet door in Building Two.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.093
I been calling and calling
and calling up housing,

27:52.095 --> 27:53.595
but ain't nothing
ever gets fixed.

27:53.597 --> 27:55.897
And now the drain
in my tub don't work.

27:55.899 --> 27:58.900
<i>It backs up and takes hours</i>
<i>before it let the water out.</i>

27:58.902 --> 28:00.018
Now what I'm supposed
to do about that

28:00.020 --> 28:01.820
when they don't
never come round?

28:03.523 --> 28:04.606
Um...

28:11.448 --> 28:12.831
<i>All right, gentlemen.</i>

28:12.833 --> 28:14.449
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to do with that vest?</i>

28:14.451 --> 28:17.002
<i>Leave it for now.</i>

28:19.623 --> 28:22.257
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stand behind the tape.

28:22.259 --> 28:24.259
- I'm a councilman. I--
<i>- It's all right, Jerry.</i>

28:24.261 --> 28:26.461
He's all right.
Let him through.

28:26.463 --> 28:28.463
- Hey, Pete.
- Mr. Mayor.

28:28.465 --> 28:30.632
Not anymore. At least one of us
made rank, though, right?

28:30.634 --> 28:32.217
What the hell happened?

28:32.219 --> 28:33.468
Pipe bomb.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.053
Watchman found it
on his rounds.

28:35.055 --> 28:37.105
- Jesus.
- Bit of a clusterfuck right now.

28:37.107 --> 28:38.139
- I see Pete Smith.
- Okay.

28:38.141 --> 28:39.274
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.

28:39.276 --> 28:42.227
- Pete!
- Hey, Nick. How you doin'?

28:42.229 --> 28:43.395
Probably better
than you.

28:43.397 --> 28:44.863
What the hell
they do to our houses?

28:44.865 --> 28:47.148
Look at this.

28:48.618 --> 28:50.452
They put the bomb
on the windowsill here.

28:50.454 --> 28:51.987
- They destroyed the bathroom.
- Wow.

28:51.989 --> 28:54.656
They shattered the tiles.
But it could have been worse.

28:54.658 --> 28:55.991
Look at this,
right here.

28:55.993 --> 28:58.660
That's a gas pipe.
That goes straight into the meter.

28:58.662 --> 29:00.712
It's not hooked up yet,
or God knows, you know?

29:00.714 --> 29:02.547
These fucking people.

29:02.549 --> 29:03.965
Yeah.

29:03.967 --> 29:05.333
I thought this
housing shit was over.

29:07.137 --> 29:10.055
These bastards
just don't quit.

29:10.057 --> 29:13.258

29:37.751 --> 29:40.502

working two fucking jobs.

29:40.504 --> 29:41.619
That's where
the fuck I've been.

29:41.621 --> 29:43.038
It's midnight.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.757

like that at work?

29:45.759 --> 29:47.208

29:58.688 --> 30:00.188
Yeah?

30:00.190 --> 30:02.724
What, you gonna
take him to work?

30:02.726 --> 30:04.859
Look, don't worry what
I'm gonna do with my son.

30:09.232 --> 30:11.900
I thought you was leaving.

30:33.390 --> 30:36.341
I can't take this shit every night.

30:37.844 --> 30:40.261
I just want things

30:40.313 --> 30:41.846

supposed to be,

30:41.898 --> 30:45.316
for the baby, you,
me, not all this.

30:45.352 --> 30:47.769
I'm here, all alone
with this baby

30:47.771 --> 30:50.605

hangin' with Rico and them after work.

31:22.806 --> 31:24.806
Yeah, you lost your fuckin' mind.

31:24.858 --> 31:28.726
- Come on.
- Boy, you crazy?

31:29.729 --> 31:31.946
We ain't had us
a little girl.

31:44.661 --> 31:47.579
This is our answer
to the pipe bombs--

31:47.581 --> 31:49.330
politics,

31:49.332 --> 31:52.800
everything thrown at us
during this project.

31:52.802 --> 31:55.670
I only hope people still
wanna live in these houses.

31:55.672 --> 31:58.590
Oh, they do.
Hmm.

31:58.592 --> 32:01.342
And they will.

32:11.238 --> 32:12.937
Mama?

32:19.863 --> 32:21.362
Who's there?

32:21.364 --> 32:22.864
<i>Who the hell
you think it is?</i>

32:22.866 --> 32:26.751
It's me,
with the groceries, Norma.

32:26.753 --> 32:28.586
<i>Did they have okra?</i>

32:28.588 --> 32:32.674
I didn't forget the okra,
and I brought the mail, too,

32:32.676 --> 32:35.376
and something from housing
they put under the door.

32:35.378 --> 32:37.262
Oh, you reading
my mail, now?

32:37.264 --> 32:39.130
You can't see it
to read it.

32:39.132 --> 32:41.015
I can see
well enough.

32:41.017 --> 32:42.600
Then read.

32:48.808 --> 32:51.025
I'm gonna
read it later.

32:54.531 --> 32:56.898
They wanna know
if people are interested

32:56.900 --> 32:59.400
in moving into
the new townhouses.

32:59.402 --> 33:02.453
142 units of public housing
will be completed

33:02.455 --> 33:04.405
sometime near
the end of this year.

33:04.407 --> 33:05.907
It says tenants
will be selected

33:05.909 --> 33:07.492
on the basis
of an open lottery.

33:07.494 --> 33:08.876
A lottery?

33:08.878 --> 33:10.745
Tenants who
are interested

33:10.747 --> 33:13.915
should indicate
by filling out the form below.

33:13.917 --> 33:16.251
Well, I ain't
going in on no lottery.

33:16.253 --> 33:18.920
I may play
the number, but...

33:18.922 --> 33:22.090
No, I'm fine
just where I am.

33:22.092 --> 33:25.760
You can barely see, Norma,
and it's just not safe around here.

33:25.762 --> 33:29.647
And with your situation,
you probably won't need no lottery.

33:29.649 --> 33:32.567
I bet you could just go
and talk to somebody downtown.

33:35.105 --> 33:37.071
Is this awkward
for you?

33:37.073 --> 33:38.940
I mean, I called because I thought
there were some things

33:38.942 --> 33:40.992
we could work on
together going forward.

33:40.994 --> 33:43.745
No, no, no, no.
I'm happy to help any way I can.

33:43.747 --> 33:45.697
What's on your mind,
Mr. Mayor?

33:47.083 --> 33:48.700
I'll cut
right to the chase.

33:48.702 --> 33:51.286
We want John Zakian
out of the Parking Authority.

33:51.288 --> 33:53.037
Well, hey,
don't I know it.

33:53.039 --> 33:54.539
I tried to get rid of him
during my term,

33:54.541 --> 33:56.124
but I lost
that battle in court.

33:56.126 --> 33:57.375
Well, it's taken
a lot of research,

33:57.377 --> 33:59.711
but Andy Maniglia
has figured out a way

33:59.713 --> 34:01.763
to get around the legal issue
by a restructuring.

34:01.765 --> 34:02.964
Short version is,

34:02.966 --> 34:04.966
we terminate his contract
with the IDA,

34:04.968 --> 34:08.636
then the Parking Authority board is
free to fire him as YPA's director.

34:08.638 --> 34:09.887
<i>But I need
to know going in</i>

34:09.889 --> 34:11.938
that I have the votes
on the YPA's board.

34:13.560 --> 34:15.643
Ah, my brother Michael.

34:15.645 --> 34:17.445
And you're close
to Nader, too.

34:21.117 --> 34:22.784
Who replaces Zakian?

34:22.786 --> 34:26.536
Guy by the name of Robert Jean,
Bob Jean.

34:26.539 --> 34:28.623
- <i> Do you know him?</i>
- Mm-mm.

34:28.625 --> 34:31.409
Professional,
not political.

34:31.411 --> 34:33.828
This is an act
of reform, Nick.

34:36.216 --> 34:38.666
Well, you both know that my wife works
for the Parking Authority,

34:38.668 --> 34:42.420
so if I go
after her boss,

34:42.422 --> 34:44.472
I need to know
that she'll come out all right.

34:46.393 --> 34:47.809
Understood.

34:51.648 --> 34:53.313
- Okay.
- <i> Great.</i>

34:53.315 --> 34:54.349
Good to see you, Nick.

34:55.851 --> 34:57.318
Happy to help.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.103
This the second time.

34:59.105 --> 35:00.655
He gonna go away
for longer now.

35:00.657 --> 35:02.824
You don't
know that yet.

35:02.826 --> 35:05.860
You don't even know what
they gonna charge him with.

35:05.862 --> 35:07.695
What'd he do exactly?

35:07.697 --> 35:10.198
I don't know
nothing else,

35:10.200 --> 35:11.949
just that the police went
to his mother's apartment

35:11.951 --> 35:14.752
and told her something about him having
a knife and trying to rob some men--

35:14.754 --> 35:16.371
A knife?

35:16.373 --> 35:19.374
Look, if you ask me, homeboy's
an asshole for going around

35:19.376 --> 35:21.175
- jacking people like that.
- I didn't ask you, did I?

35:21.177 --> 35:22.960
- I'm just saying.
- No, fuck you, Meeka.

35:22.962 --> 35:25.213
Come on, that's my man.

35:31.721 --> 35:34.105
Where's he at now?

35:34.107 --> 35:35.223
Rikers?

35:35.225 --> 35:37.975
He got arrested
in the county,

35:37.977 --> 35:41.112
so they took him up
to the county jail in Valhalla.

35:42.732 --> 35:45.066
Westchester ain't
the city, Meeka.

35:45.068 --> 35:47.068
They make people jail up there.

35:47.070 --> 35:49.070
They give people
years and shit.

36:02.419 --> 36:04.969
The mayor came to me. He brought me in.

36:04.971 --> 36:06.637
He asked
for my help with this.

36:06.639 --> 36:07.755
<i>So what?</i>

36:07.757 --> 36:10.174
Let Zaleski do
his own dirty work.

36:10.176 --> 36:12.510
So, he's a Democratic mayor,

36:12.512 --> 36:14.896
and I'm the veteran
Democrat on the council.

36:14.898 --> 36:17.231
And he comes
to me for help.

36:17.233 --> 36:18.599
This is him
bringing me in here.

36:18.601 --> 36:20.351
This is him finally making
good on his promise

36:20.353 --> 36:21.986
to make me part
of the administration.

36:21.988 --> 36:23.821
I can't fucking
believe this.

36:23.823 --> 36:27.325
You're gonna try to fire
my boss for no reason.

36:27.327 --> 36:28.443
Don't do this, Nick.

36:28.445 --> 36:30.278
Nay, it's about
the bigger picture.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.779
If I throw in
with Zaleski,

36:31.781 --> 36:33.998
I become the go-to guy
on the council.

36:37.787 --> 36:39.504
I don't know, Nick.

36:39.506 --> 36:41.122
You don't know?

36:42.592 --> 36:44.425
I don't think
it's a good idea.

36:46.596 --> 36:48.463
Christ Almighty,
what's the matter with you people?

36:48.465 --> 36:52.300
<i>♪ we only run for the money,</i>
<i>got no strings attached... ♪</i>

36:52.302 --> 36:55.136
Maria!

36:59.442 --> 37:01.275
- What's all this?
- New pots.

37:01.277 --> 37:04.111
Three heavy iron ones,
very good quality.

37:04.113 --> 37:05.780
A woman at work
sells them through a catalogue.

37:05.782 --> 37:07.281
No, no,
don't open it.

37:07.283 --> 37:10.651
They're for the new house,
when we get the new house.

37:10.653 --> 37:13.321
But what's the point of a pot
if you can't cook in it?

37:14.491 --> 37:16.707
They're too good
for this place.

37:16.709 --> 37:19.494
I don't know,
I can't explain.

37:19.496 --> 37:21.579
They're like us.

37:22.749 --> 37:23.998
<i>No. Come on.</i>

37:24.000 --> 37:25.800
<i>I'll show you,</i>
<i>I'm not cheating.</i>

37:25.802 --> 37:27.335
<i>- Yes, you are.</i>
<i>- No, I'm not.</i>

37:27.337 --> 37:29.670
- Where are you from?
- Milwaukee.

37:29.672 --> 37:31.973
- Would you help me?
- Sure.

37:31.975 --> 37:35.059
Noted for good beer,
women with lovely legs,

37:35.061 --> 37:36.978
<i>and practically</i>
<i>no millionaires.</i>

37:38.565 --> 37:40.848
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

37:42.068 --> 37:43.518
I'm gonna
go to bed, okay?

37:43.520 --> 37:45.319
All right, baby girl.

37:45.321 --> 37:47.738
Give a kiss.

37:47.740 --> 37:50.107
Tasha, let me ask you--

37:50.109 --> 37:53.194
you're all right
living here, right?

37:53.196 --> 37:55.363
Ma, I don't know.
I guess so.

37:55.365 --> 37:57.949
Uh, you know,
this is what I know.

37:57.951 --> 38:00.368
I ain't lived
anywhere else.

38:00.370 --> 38:01.919
Get some sleep.

38:04.757 --> 38:06.007
Well, you're
good at it.

38:06.009 --> 38:07.959
I've learned who to call
about what problems.

38:07.961 --> 38:09.427
So what?

38:09.429 --> 38:12.263
But to change
anything for real?

38:12.265 --> 38:13.714
They had a grant
program for HUD,

38:13.716 --> 38:16.717
and I sent a list of ideas
up Central Avenue.

38:16.719 --> 38:18.686
We need security here,
new doors,

38:18.688 --> 38:20.271
fences on the playground
for the children.

38:20.273 --> 38:22.056
But nothing.

38:22.058 --> 38:24.025
Shit, I wanna do more
than write down

38:24.027 --> 38:26.861
everybody's complaints about their own
apartments and then call them in.

38:26.863 --> 38:28.279
I want a neighborhood.

38:28.281 --> 38:30.364
You thinking about applying
for those new townhouses?

38:30.366 --> 38:32.867
Already did.

38:32.869 --> 38:35.786
Those new townhouses
are guaranteed to fail.

38:35.788 --> 38:37.405
They built them
because they had to,

38:37.407 --> 38:39.407
but that don't mean
they want them to work.

38:39.409 --> 38:41.158
You know what
Sadie calls them?

38:41.160 --> 38:42.743
Cardboard houses.

38:42.745 --> 38:44.662
- 'Cause they put them up so fast.
- Oh, come on.

38:44.664 --> 38:47.915
They put them up fast
so that they would fall apart fast.

38:47.917 --> 38:52.253
And then those white folks could say
that we can't take care of nothin'.

38:52.255 --> 38:54.338
You gonna get yourself
killed over there on the East Side.

38:54.340 --> 38:56.090
They do not want us.

38:59.012 --> 39:02.013
<i>Billie. Billie, you home?</i>

39:10.823 --> 39:13.658
Oh, you got
your hands full, girl.

39:15.745 --> 39:19.163
Yes.

39:19.165 --> 39:21.082
Grandma's here.

39:23.536 --> 39:25.286
You gonna fill
this out, Billie?

39:27.290 --> 39:29.173
Billie.

39:29.175 --> 39:31.292
Fill out what?

39:31.294 --> 39:34.762
You might wanna
change that diaper.

39:34.764 --> 39:37.632
Baby's eyes are big
and brown enough as it is.

39:50.980 --> 39:53.648
I don't feel
that this is right.

39:53.650 --> 39:56.200
I shouldn't be asking
for special treatment.

39:56.202 --> 39:57.868
You're blind, Norma.

39:57.870 --> 40:00.237
- I can see more than you think.
- Mm-hmm.

40:01.491 --> 40:02.823
There's him,
right there.

40:02.825 --> 40:04.375
Where?

40:04.377 --> 40:05.660
Stand your blind ass up.

40:05.662 --> 40:08.329
- Mr. Smith.
- Hmm? That's me.

40:08.331 --> 40:10.247
Heard you had
a meeting here today.

40:10.249 --> 40:12.800
I'd like to speak
with you, please.

40:12.802 --> 40:14.885
Sure.

40:14.887 --> 40:18.055
Mr. Smith,
I'm legally blind

40:18.057 --> 40:20.341
and I live here
in Building Six.

40:20.343 --> 40:23.310
- And your name is?
- Norma O'Neal.

40:23.312 --> 40:24.562
And it's not
that I'm afraid

40:24.564 --> 40:27.181
or that I can't do
for myself or anything like that,

40:27.183 --> 40:29.316
because I've been living
here long enough that...

40:29.318 --> 40:33.154
Well, I don't want to make it sound
as though I'm asking you for--

40:33.156 --> 40:37.608
Mr. Smith, Schlobohm is no place
for a blind woman.

40:40.163 --> 40:41.662
Okay.

40:41.664 --> 40:44.699
Well, there are
handicapped units at each site

40:44.701 --> 40:45.916
for those who qualify.

40:45.918 --> 40:47.084
Do you require
home assistance?

40:47.086 --> 40:48.536
Well,
that's another thing.

40:48.538 --> 40:50.755
It's hard to get
home care to come here.

40:50.757 --> 40:53.874
But I go every week
to the Guild for the Blind.

40:53.876 --> 40:55.376
Two years next March.

40:55.378 --> 40:58.929
Ms. O'Neal, you have one of those
ladies over there at the guild

40:58.931 --> 41:01.182
write me a letter
saying all of this,

41:01.184 --> 41:03.384
and we'll start
from there, okay?

41:03.386 --> 41:05.052
There you go.

41:07.940 --> 41:09.724
How'd I do?

41:09.726 --> 41:11.559
Wasn't for me,
you'd still be explaining

41:11.561 --> 41:15.312
why Schlobohm ain't bad
at all, considering.

41:15.314 --> 41:16.731
Come on.

41:16.733 --> 41:18.816
<i>Before we even
get to the lottery,</i>

41:18.818 --> 41:23.070
we need to know that whoever is picked
for these homes is going to succeed,

41:23.072 --> 41:25.906
that they're going to make their
way in these neighborhoods.

41:25.908 --> 41:29.543
Now that means knowing
who these families are,

41:29.545 --> 41:32.913
what they're capable of, and
what they might need help with.

41:32.915 --> 41:35.332
- Excuse me, Mr. Mayhawk.
- Mm-hmm.

41:35.334 --> 41:37.051
Will my husband be able
to come with me?

41:37.053 --> 41:38.552
Mrs. Earl
and her daughter

41:38.554 --> 41:40.755
have coordinated
the appointments.

41:40.757 --> 41:42.389
The families know
that they're being screened

41:42.391 --> 41:43.758
and they know
that you're coming.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.894
Excuse me, how will we
get back and forth?

41:46.896 --> 41:49.563
It will be
all right, Mary.

41:49.565 --> 41:51.265
That'll be all
for tonight.

41:51.267 --> 41:52.566
<i>Thank you.</i>

42:00.359 --> 42:01.609
Now, how much
are they gonna learn

42:01.611 --> 42:03.778
about the applicants
in one or two visits?

42:03.780 --> 42:06.447
Learn about the families?
Just a few basics.

42:06.449 --> 42:08.949
It's all there's time for
at this point.

42:08.951 --> 42:11.118
Learn about themselves.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.287
Hmm.

42:13.289 --> 42:15.122
You know.

42:15.124 --> 42:17.458
- Hey, so, for starters,
we'll go to the sixth floor. - Great.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.793
- Okay?
- Okay.

42:18.795 --> 42:21.011
- You've got it all set up.
- Absolutely.

42:21.013 --> 42:23.964
Fellas,
how are you doing?

42:23.966 --> 42:26.183
<i>As usual.</i>

42:26.185 --> 42:28.435
Okay.

42:28.437 --> 42:30.805
No, no, you're gonna
want the good stairwell.

42:30.807 --> 42:33.190
Why is that
the good stairwell?

42:33.192 --> 42:35.643
It's the one for walking
up and down.

42:36.863 --> 42:39.563
So what is
the bad stairwell for?

42:39.565 --> 42:41.982
Please.

42:43.870 --> 42:46.153

44:25.388 --> 44:27.554

- Thanks.

44:31.761 --> 44:33.844
Getting to
know some of them...

44:36.599 --> 44:38.766
I appreciate you
telling us...

44:43.739 --> 44:45.940
<i>I said turn around!
Turn around!</i>

44:51.580 --> 44:53.497
And what, I carry
this asshole's water,

44:53.499 --> 44:55.749
I get rid of Zakian
just 'cause he asked me to,

44:55.751 --> 44:57.368
and then I get the freeze
for the next month.

44:57.370 --> 44:59.753
No phone calls,
no thank yous.

44:59.755 --> 45:01.005
I mean, shit,
I'm supposedly

45:01.007 --> 45:02.373
the party leader
on the council,

45:02.375 --> 45:04.174
and I gotta find out the date
of the housing lottery

45:04.176 --> 45:05.509
from the fucking newspaper

45:05.511 --> 45:07.344
like I didn't have
anything to do with it?

45:07.346 --> 45:08.963
And now I got the Republican
leader telling me

45:08.965 --> 45:10.464
that other council
members are invited?

45:10.466 --> 45:13.100
I mean, no offense, John,
but Jesus on a fucking cracker.

45:13.102 --> 45:15.302
No offense taken.
I'd be pissed off, too.

45:15.304 --> 45:19.106
This shit
is no oversight, okay?

45:19.108 --> 45:22.643
I've paid more politically for
that housing than he'll ever know,

45:22.645 --> 45:25.946
but Terry Zaleski wants
the credit all to himself.

45:29.201 --> 45:30.868
Today I need
a tall fucking drink.

45:30.870 --> 45:32.069
I'll buy.

45:32.071 --> 45:33.320
Good, it's about time
you pulled out

45:33.322 --> 45:34.822
that fat,
Republican wallet.

45:48.337 --> 45:51.088
What?

45:51.140 --> 45:53.090
"You have been selected
for the opportunity

45:53.142 --> 45:54.341
to move into
the new housing

45:54.393 --> 45:56.510
and have been assigned
a handicapped apartment."

45:56.562 --> 45:59.346
- Oh, my God.
- "Congratulations to you and your family.

45:59.398 --> 46:01.849
Very truly yours,
Peter Smith."

46:03.853 --> 46:06.020
See what you did
with all your meddlin'?

46:06.022 --> 46:08.188
Oh, girl.

46:08.240 --> 46:10.741
No, no, no, no. You know,
you're getting better at it.

46:10.776 --> 46:14.028
You just gotta gavel
them down sometimes, end the debate.

46:14.080 --> 46:15.496
I just get nervous.

46:15.531 --> 46:18.365
I'm figuring out
the right time to cut him off.

46:18.367 --> 46:20.250
Yeah, well, that will come
with time, you know?

46:20.336 --> 46:22.369
I can give you
a nod or a sign.

46:22.371 --> 46:25.456
Vinni told me this was a
tradition with the two of you.

46:25.508 --> 46:28.675
Oh, that's my weak spot, John.

46:28.711 --> 46:30.544
So what are we gonna do
about this asshole?

46:30.546 --> 46:33.263
- Zaleski?
- No, "Mu-hammar Ca-doofie."

46:33.299 --> 46:35.599
Yeah, fuckin' Zaleski.

46:35.634 --> 46:37.217
Hey, you guys
campaigned with him.

46:37.219 --> 46:39.386
Oh, come on, John.
What were we gonna do?

46:39.388 --> 46:41.472
He was the Democratic
nominee.

46:41.524 --> 46:44.725
I mean this guy
actually believes

46:44.777 --> 46:47.611
he is the only
honest man left

46:47.646 --> 46:49.396
and that corruption
is everywhere.

46:49.398 --> 46:51.899
- I know. - And that Yonkers
is Gomorrah-on-Hudson.

46:51.901 --> 46:54.234
It's all this
"investigate this, investigate that."

46:54.286 --> 46:55.903
It's all this
star chamber shit.

46:55.955 --> 46:58.072
You know he actually
put up a room

46:58.074 --> 47:00.074
in City Hall
with a two-way mirror

47:00.076 --> 47:01.909
so he can watch
Andy Maniglia's people

47:01.911 --> 47:03.410
interrogate city workers?

47:03.412 --> 47:06.130
- It's true. It's on the first floor.
- Yeah.

47:06.165 --> 47:07.581
- Hey, Kath.
- Huh?

47:07.583 --> 47:09.800
What do the girls
in the office call Zaleski?

47:09.835 --> 47:11.418
Eliot Ness.

47:11.470 --> 47:13.587
"Mr. Untouchable."

47:13.639 --> 47:15.472
- Yeah.
- Well, he did run as a reform.

47:15.508 --> 47:17.307
You know what?
We all run on whatever.

47:17.343 --> 47:19.510
But if you get in,
you have to fucking govern.

47:19.562 --> 47:21.845
- Hear, hear.
- Yeah.

47:21.897 --> 47:24.598
To four more years
of fuckin' Terry Zaleski.

47:24.650 --> 47:26.934
<i>- God.</i>
- Hear, hear.

47:28.938 --> 47:31.939
- We have a decimate-- designated driver.
- Ooh! Whoo!

47:31.991 --> 47:33.740
I know.
I can drive. I'm all right.

47:33.776 --> 47:35.943
I'm-- I'm feeling
very good.

47:35.995 --> 47:37.828
You know what?
You don't even need a car.

47:37.863 --> 47:41.031
You can just flap your
wings and fly south.

47:43.586 --> 47:45.836
- Oh!
- Whoa, you can't even stand.

47:45.871 --> 47:47.788
- Come on.
- It's all right. What? I'm standing.

47:47.790 --> 47:50.424
What do you mean?
I'm standing here.

47:50.459 --> 47:52.593
I'm standing here!

47:55.131 --> 47:57.631
- Mmm.
- Oh.

47:59.135 --> 48:01.552
John's right.

48:03.439 --> 48:05.973
I should have run
for mayor.

48:06.025 --> 48:08.775
I could have beat
this guy, Vin.

48:08.811 --> 48:10.811
I could have...

48:10.863 --> 48:13.981
So you do it
in four years.

48:15.151 --> 48:18.285
But, Nick, you can't
take it personally.

48:18.320 --> 48:21.071
What?

48:21.123 --> 48:24.241
You can't confuse
votes with love.

48:24.293 --> 48:26.960
They're not
the same thing.

48:28.080 --> 48:29.713
They're not?

48:33.385 --> 48:35.552
Called you a cab, Nicky.
It's on its way.

48:35.588 --> 48:39.306
I am all right. I'm gonna drive.

48:39.341 --> 48:41.558
- Yeah?
- Feeling fine. Yeah, it's very close.

48:41.594 --> 48:43.010
Thank you
for the Sambuca.

48:43.062 --> 48:45.846
- Be safe.
- <i> Arrivederci,</i> Vin.
