[sirens wailing]

00:04.700 --> 00:06.615
[helicopter whirring]

00:16.973 --> 00:18.148
Where is she?DONNY: This way.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.410
I found her hiding
in the shed,

00:19.454 --> 00:21.282
and she won't come out;
she's pretty scared.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.849
Is she injured?She's got bloodied feet,

00:23.893 --> 00:25.634
and she also has her wrists--

00:25.677 --> 00:28.028
I think she was tied up.

00:31.161 --> 00:33.250
Got to be her, right?
The girl from the news.

00:40.344 --> 00:41.780
KATSUMOTO:
Amanda?

00:43.826 --> 00:45.958
Amanda?

00:46.002 --> 00:49.005
It's the police, Amanda.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.620
She was in here, I swear.

00:57.318 --> 00:58.928
Get the dogs.Copy that.

00:58.971 --> 01:01.409
[grunting, panting]

01:05.717 --> 01:07.937
â™ª

01:26.999 --> 01:29.654
MAGNUM: As a private
investigator, you tend to work

01:29.698 --> 01:32.918
a lot of low-profile,
under-the-radar cases,

01:32.962 --> 01:35.486
helping those who have
no one else to turn to.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.445
I was a little surprised
when I got a call

01:37.488 --> 01:39.142
from the parents
of Amanda Sako.

01:39.186 --> 01:40.926
She was abducted
six weeks back,

01:40.970 --> 01:42.754
but escaped after a few days.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.322
Tough kid.
Case got a lot of attention.

01:45.366 --> 01:48.108
They had HPD, Five-O,
even the FBI on it.

01:48.151 --> 01:51.502
Which makes me wonder,
what do they want with me?

01:51.546 --> 01:54.723
We want you to catch
the person who took Amanda.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.900
As far as I know, HPD is still
investigating the case, right?

01:57.943 --> 02:01.469
Technically, but they haven't
made any progress.

02:01.512 --> 02:03.862
The man who kidnapped
our daughter is still out there.

02:03.906 --> 02:07.649
I learned a little bit about
what happened from the news.

02:07.692 --> 02:11.696
She was taken
not too far from here, right?

02:11.740 --> 02:13.785
She was walking over to her
friend Sophie's house.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.657
The were doing SAT prep.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.355
She forgot her laptop, and
was walking back to get it.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.227
Except she never
made it back here.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.142
He walked up to her
on the street,

02:22.185 --> 02:25.232
blew some powder
in her face, this--

02:25.275 --> 02:27.625
They call it Devil's Breath?

02:27.669 --> 02:30.324
Hmm. Scopolamine.Right.

02:30.367 --> 02:33.022
He put her in a trunk,
took her out to the woods,

02:33.065 --> 02:34.937
stuck her in a shed
or something.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.983
He blindfolded her
and tied her up.

02:38.027 --> 02:40.464
But she escaped.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.684
After five days.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.121
The police found her
out near a farm in Waialua.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.168
And he never attempted
to contact you

02:48.211 --> 02:49.908
or made
any ransom demands?

02:49.952 --> 02:52.737
No. Not that we could
give him much.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.391
I'm an I.T. consultant.

02:54.435 --> 02:57.220
Mari is a math teacher
at Oahu Prep.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.528
Mr. and Mrs. Sako,

03:00.571 --> 03:04.532
I am sorry to have
to ask this, but did...?

03:04.575 --> 03:07.317
He didn't touch her.
Not that way, at least.

03:09.972 --> 03:12.235
It's okay. We know
it's relevant.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.324
ALAN: We still don't
know why he took her.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.109
The police said they thought
maybe he was going to...

03:17.153 --> 03:19.721
I don't know, sell her.

03:21.636 --> 03:24.943
Can I talk to Amanda?

03:24.987 --> 03:27.685
You can try.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.389
[quiet knock on door]

03:35.432 --> 03:37.652
Amanda?

03:37.695 --> 03:40.045
This is Mr. Magnum.

03:40.089 --> 03:44.267
He's the private investigator
we were telling you about.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.662
Hi, Amanda.
I'm Thomas.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.273
Nice to meet you.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.014
Hi.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.711
[phone ringing in distance]

03:55.974 --> 03:58.499
Do you mind if I, uh...

03:58.542 --> 04:00.675
Mind if I talk to you
for a minute?

04:06.289 --> 04:10.119
Where is that?
'Akaka Falls?

04:10.162 --> 04:12.121
One of your favorite
places maybe, huh?

04:12.164 --> 04:13.601
No.

04:13.644 --> 04:15.907
Amanda, please.
He's trying to help.

04:15.951 --> 04:16.995
Well, I don't want his help.

04:17.039 --> 04:18.301
I told you,
I don't want to do this.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.869
Honey...No, no, it's, it's okay.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.392
It's, um...

04:24.786 --> 04:29.747
It's hard to talk to people
after what you've been through.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.272
You don't know
who to trust.

04:34.099 --> 04:36.928
Believe me,
I know what it's like.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.322
Really?

04:39.366 --> 04:41.977
You know what it feels like?

04:42.020 --> 04:46.416
I was held when I was
in the military.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.765
I get it.

04:55.991 --> 04:58.907
Look, I just...

04:58.950 --> 05:01.692
I just want to put it
behind me, okay?

05:01.736 --> 05:04.521
But I can't do that when
everyone keeps bringing it up.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.828
I just want,
I just want to be left alone.

05:08.830 --> 05:10.440
[door closes]

05:15.271 --> 05:19.319
This was our daughter.

05:19.362 --> 05:21.712
We were so grateful
when they found her.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.671
We thought they got her back,
but they didn't.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.804
Not this girl.
This girl didn't come home.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.112
Finding the man who took her

05:30.155 --> 05:31.940
is the only thing
that will bring her back.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.901
MAGNUM:
I got was Alan was saying.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.077
In a way,
Amanda's still a prisoner.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.123
Her parents think finding
their daughter's kidnapper

05:41.166 --> 05:42.820
will help her heal.

05:42.864 --> 05:45.170
I have my own personal
reasons to think they're right.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.781
But if I'm gonna get anywhere,

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
she needs to tell me
what happened first.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.088
And that might require help
from someone

05:50.132 --> 05:52.003
with a more gentle touch. HIGGINS: Pull!

05:52.047 --> 05:53.962
[gunshot]

05:54.005 --> 05:57.226
Six out of six.
Pretty badass.

05:57.269 --> 05:58.923
Mahalo, Kumu.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.055
Ready?

06:00.098 --> 06:03.275
Yeah. Pull!

06:03.319 --> 06:05.843
[gunshot, clay disk shatters]Whoa!

06:05.887 --> 06:07.279
What are you doing?

06:07.323 --> 06:09.064
You okay, Thomas?

06:09.107 --> 06:10.544
[chuckles]:
Yeah, just suffering

06:10.587 --> 06:12.589
from a minor heart attack;
no big deal.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.852
You don't think I'd actually
shot at you, Magnum?

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
To be fair,
it could've happened.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.247
She's right.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.771
Yes, but I wouldn't have missed
is my point.

06:20.815 --> 06:21.468
Pull.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.386
Thomas, do me a favor
and take over for me.

06:26.429 --> 06:28.257
I got to get
to the cultural center.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.433
Aloha!
Aloha.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.914
Well?

06:32.957 --> 06:34.785
Well, what?

06:34.829 --> 06:36.961
You want a favor.
Out with it.

06:37.005 --> 06:39.311
I don't want anything from you.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.705
It's for a client, correct?

06:41.749 --> 06:43.446
Yeah.

06:43.490 --> 06:44.665
Well, then it's really for you.

06:44.708 --> 06:49.626
Okay, my client
is Amanda Sako.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.281
You know, the girl that was
kidnapped not too long ago?

06:52.324 --> 06:53.456
HIGGINS:
I don't understand.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.110
I mean, if she won't
talk to you,

06:55.153 --> 06:57.634
what is it you think
I can do?

06:57.678 --> 07:00.115
Well, you know Rick,
Nuzo, TC, and I

07:00.158 --> 07:04.119
were, uh, held
by the Taliban, right?

07:04.162 --> 07:06.382
Uh, yeah.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.167
I-I heard about that.

07:09.211 --> 07:12.867
Okay, so after we escaped,
we, uh, got sent to

07:12.910 --> 07:15.478
this military hospital in
Germany and met this corpsman

07:15.522 --> 07:18.263
who had lost four guys
in his unit.

07:18.307 --> 07:20.352
You know, he was spiraling;
none of the meds or therapies

07:20.396 --> 07:21.658
they tried on him worked.

07:21.702 --> 07:25.488
But the one thing
that did help was... yoga.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.491
There have been several
controlled trials

07:28.535 --> 07:30.928
showing that yoga helps
with PTSD.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.756
Yeah, well, I know
this might be a long shot,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.715
but I'm thinking that
maybe it could help Amanda.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.978
Plus, she was
taken by a man,

07:37.021 --> 07:39.720
and I just feel like she
might be more comfortable

07:39.763 --> 07:42.244
around a woman.

07:42.287 --> 07:45.160
I just don't know
what else to do.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.774
[dogs fussing]

07:50.818 --> 07:53.255
Apollo likes you.
He's hard to please.

07:53.298 --> 07:56.824
Well, I'm not gonna
answer any questions.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.479
That's all right, 'cause
I'm not gonna ask you any.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.221
Then why am I here?

08:03.265 --> 08:07.530
Questions, or even talking--
useless in the state you're in.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.532
My "state"?

08:10.664 --> 08:12.492
A state of imbalance.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.802
Now, the purpose
of yoga is balance.

08:21.370 --> 08:24.025
[inhales deeply]

08:24.068 --> 08:26.070
[exhales]

08:29.334 --> 08:32.207
And until you're balanced...

08:32.250 --> 08:34.209
you're no good to anyone.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.602
Especially yourself.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.520
[breathing deeply]

08:56.318 --> 08:58.712
[sighs] Trust me.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.844
You think I do this
to stay in shape?

09:03.020 --> 09:04.631
Arms up.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.635
Come on.

09:10.027 --> 09:13.074
Katsumoto, thanks for coming.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.293
Got to admit, I didn't
think you'd want to help.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.295
Normally, you don't
appreciate my, uh...

09:17.339 --> 09:18.862
interference.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.211
Maybe you're growing
on me, Magnum.

09:21.909 --> 09:24.085
You're not growing on me.
I'm helping because

09:24.128 --> 09:25.869
it could help
both of us.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.958
And more importantly, Amanda.
Here's the case file.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.091
It's thin.

09:30.134 --> 09:32.659
Amanda was traumatized and
wouldn't really talk to us.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.313
Plus, she never got a good
look at her kidnapper.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.793
I'm sure you canvassed
the neighborhood.

09:36.837 --> 09:38.316
You come up with anything?

09:38.360 --> 09:40.580
No. We also talked to
her friends, teachers.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.407
We dumped her phone.
Still nothing.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.148
How is that even possible?

09:44.192 --> 09:45.759
I don't know.

09:45.802 --> 09:48.457
But one thing I do know is that
predator is still out there.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.894
Maybe he'll grab some other kid.
Maybe he already has.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.548
Maybe there were
others before Amanda.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.682
Point is, I want to catch this
guy before he harms anyone else,

09:55.725 --> 09:57.640
and give that young
lady some peace.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.600
But I keep hitting
a wall, so...

10:00.643 --> 10:04.821
if you can generate a lead,
well, I'm just fine with that.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.649
Six weeks ago,
the guy who owns this place

10:06.693 --> 10:08.129
found her hiding in there.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.653
And she took off
right before we got here.

10:10.697 --> 10:13.351
[sighs]
Any idea why?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.353
I think she was scared.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.921
She'd just spent
five days in captivity,

10:17.965 --> 10:21.882
bound to a wall in some
dark, windowless place.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.667
Both hands were zip-tied.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.409
And he had her deep in
the woods, somewhere out there.

10:27.452 --> 10:29.019
You have no idea where.

10:29.063 --> 10:31.848
Well, tracing her footprints,

10:31.892 --> 10:34.503
they all came from
somewhere east of here.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.680
Now, we think after she escaped,
she ran for two to three hours,

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
which means
she could have traveled

10:39.334 --> 10:40.901
up to a dozen miles that night.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.685
So your search grid
must have covered

10:42.729 --> 10:43.904
at least a hundred square miles.

10:43.947 --> 10:47.516
115. And believe me,
we searched every inch.

10:47.559 --> 10:48.822
Didn't find a thing.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.314
HIGGINS:
One hand.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.533
Easy. Slowly.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.274
Oh. [grunts]Wait...

11:06.317 --> 11:07.492
[whimpers]

11:07.536 --> 11:10.713
Oh. Apollo.Okay.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.803
I can't do this.Yes, you can.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.153
No.
You absolutely can.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.678
And when you do,
you'll realize

11:18.721 --> 11:22.856
there is nothing more empowering
than your body achieving

11:22.899 --> 11:25.554
something your mind
thought it couldn't.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.164
It's not that easy.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.731
Nothing is.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.734
You cannot let
what happened to you

11:31.778 --> 11:34.041
chart the course
of the rest of your life.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.739
What makes you such an expert?

11:36.783 --> 11:40.438
Age, for one thing.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.353
You're not that old.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.008
[chuckles]
Thank you.

11:45.052 --> 11:48.098
But, uh, age is more
than a measurement of time.

11:48.142 --> 11:52.363
It's a catalog of experiences.

11:52.407 --> 11:54.714
And I, too,
have some unpleasant ones.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.154
[sighs]:
Oh, God.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.982
How do...

12:02.025 --> 12:06.726
I told you, I don't just
do this to stay in shape.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.597
[chuckles softly]

12:08.640 --> 12:10.817
[grunts]
No.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.297
No. No. No.
[laughs]
Nearly.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.212
[both laugh]

12:18.520 --> 12:19.826
[knocking on door]

12:21.479 --> 12:22.654
Hey.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.482
Is Amanda okay?

12:24.526 --> 12:25.875
Yes.

12:25.919 --> 12:29.749
Um, and I think
she's ready to talk.

12:38.061 --> 12:41.717
There's a lot I don't remember.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.762
Just tell us
what you do remember.

12:47.636 --> 12:51.031
AMANDA:
I couldn't get my hands free.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.424
Finally,
I-I dislocated my thumb. [thumb cracks, Amanda screams]

12:53.468 --> 12:55.296
[exhales]

12:55.339 --> 12:58.212
I had no idea where I was.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.954
I just kept running,
as fast as I could.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.784
And I found that man's house.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.877
I don't remember much else.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.531
You are a very strong
young woman.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.229
[scoffs]

13:15.272 --> 13:17.057
No, Higgins is right.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.712
You know, when I was
a prisoner in Afghanistan,

13:20.756 --> 13:22.105
it was my obligation
to try to escape.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.107
Not to mention
I had three weeks

13:24.151 --> 13:25.761
of naval training
on how to do it.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.242
I had three guys with me.

13:28.285 --> 13:31.288
You had the courage
to escape all by yourself.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.643
Can you do something for me?

13:40.384 --> 13:42.343
I'd like you to close your eyes.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.040
Wh-Why?

13:44.084 --> 13:46.913
Well, when we escaped,
the Special Ops guys

13:46.956 --> 13:49.132
had me do
this exercise to help

13:49.176 --> 13:52.483
recall the details
of the camp that I was at.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.094
It helped pinpoint its location.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.705
I'd like to do
the same thing with you.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.707
[exhales]

13:58.750 --> 14:02.450
Okay, so just relax.

14:02.493 --> 14:05.061
Think about the very first step
you took outside.

14:05.105 --> 14:09.283
Not just what you saw,
but smell,

14:09.326 --> 14:12.416
hear, touch.
Everything matters.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.288
[panting]

14:14.331 --> 14:17.247
Was there a breeze?
Maybe some trade winds?

14:19.684 --> 14:24.254
No, uh... there was a smell.

14:24.298 --> 14:27.649
Almost like mint.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.433
Or pine.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.173
Eucalyptus?

14:32.088 --> 14:35.831
Okay. So you went through the
woods, you smelled eucalyptus.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.485
What else?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.661
AMANDA:
There was this plant,

14:39.704 --> 14:41.228
wi-with a weird seed.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.794
Weird how?

14:42.838 --> 14:47.799
Big, like the, the size
of a cell phone, almost.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.106
Mm. Sounds like an uhiuhi tree.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.675
Also known as
a Mezoneuron kavaiense.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.809
Yeah. That's-that's it.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.942
Uhiuhi?
I've never heard of it.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.118
It's almost extinct in the wild.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.728
It's very rare.MAGNUM: Where
does it grow?

15:03.772 --> 15:06.383
On Oahu? Only the leeward side.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.428
Leeward?

15:07.471 --> 15:08.820
What?

15:08.864 --> 15:11.171
HPD focused
their search on the east,

15:11.214 --> 15:12.389
which is where they thought

15:12.433 --> 15:13.738
Amanda came from,
but if that flower

15:13.782 --> 15:15.653
only grows on the leeward side,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.351
uh, she didn't come
from the east.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.700
She came from the west.

15:18.743 --> 15:19.570
They were looking
in the wrong place.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.796
I've swept
the northeast quadrant.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.972
No signs of any structure.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.756
But there's heavy tree cover.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.671
Monkey pod trees everywhere.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.586
I'm gonna head south.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.023
Roger that.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.416
Northeast quadrant
swept, moving south.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.815
What do you think?

15:46.858 --> 15:47.598
Anything look familiar?

15:47.642 --> 15:49.905
No. Nothing.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.515
Be patient.

15:51.559 --> 15:52.821
Ah, little tense.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.344
You know what I think you need?

15:54.388 --> 15:55.824
I think you should do more yoga.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.695
Maybe, uh, maybe Dogface Pose?

15:57.739 --> 15:58.958
[pants]

15:59.001 --> 16:00.220
That's not a pose.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.961
Yeah, it is.
I'm pretty sure it is.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.266
I'll ask Higgins to show you.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.702
She loves
watching people suffer.Lucky me.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.490
Haven't had to hump it like
this since we fled the Korengal.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.187
The Korengal Valley.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.710
Where you were imprisoned?

16:12.754 --> 16:15.061
I cannot imagine
what that was like.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.237
Yeah. Good times.
Great memories.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.500
I'm glad you had each other,
at least.

16:19.543 --> 16:22.459
Well, not always. When we were
there, they liked to put Thomas

16:22.503 --> 16:24.896
in solitary confinement
for long stretches.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.550
Yeah, when he was there,

16:26.594 --> 16:28.683
we didn't know if he
was dead or alive.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.947
Uh, Frisky Rabbit pose,
and I Just Threw Up pose.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.558
AMANDA [chuckles]: Gross.TC: Yo, Orville!

16:34.602 --> 16:35.907
I may have something.

16:35.951 --> 16:36.865
Thomas!

16:38.171 --> 16:39.824
What do you see?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.565
I got an odd patch of dark green

16:41.609 --> 16:45.091
about six klicks south
of your position.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.528
Amanda said the place
was cement, right?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.269
Cement holds moisture.
It can cause the-the plants

16:49.312 --> 16:51.923
around it to grow more lush.All right.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.142
Send the coordinates.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.148
Look.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.237
RICK: Must be
from World War II.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.690
I'm gonna have a look around.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.218
Thomas.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.053
This is it.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.010
HIGGINS:
Magnum?

17:37.665 --> 17:39.058
I think I found something.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.671
Looks like ATV tracks.Mm.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.586
You think they belong
to the kidnapper?

17:45.629 --> 17:47.718
Would they be here
after six weeks?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.720
Well, this part of the island
hasn't see much rain

17:49.764 --> 17:52.593
in the last few weeks,
so it's certainly possible.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.377
[rustling]What was that?

17:58.947 --> 18:00.383
[panting]

18:00.427 --> 18:01.471
Hey!

18:04.866 --> 18:07.042
Flank him!Yeah.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.933
[grunting]

18:28.977 --> 18:30.979
Nice tackle.Yeah, thanks.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.937
[panting]

18:32.981 --> 18:33.808
Let's chat, shall we?

18:40.075 --> 18:41.511
[engines whirring]

18:44.862 --> 18:46.777
[engines stop]

18:46.821 --> 18:49.215
Start processing.Yes, sir.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.522
You didn't question him,
did you?

18:52.566 --> 18:56.047
Uh, well, we had a
lot of time to kill.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.658
You can be mad
at me later.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.051
Carter Ning, this is
Detective Katsumoto.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.793
Carter's been staying
in this bunker for the
past several months.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.056
He's homeless. He said
the only reason why he ran

19:05.100 --> 19:06.754
is 'cause he thought
we were cops, and he's got

19:06.797 --> 19:08.277
this possession charge
hanging over him.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.323
I'm gonna ask once:
you kidnap this girl?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.759
No.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.283
You didn't even
look at it.No. No way. I...

19:14.327 --> 19:15.458
I never
seen her before.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.068
Carter, tell him
what you told us.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.941
Okay. Sure.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.334
Which part?

19:21.377 --> 19:24.815
About what happened here
six weeks ago, genius.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.730
Right, yeah, uh, okay.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.733
This tree hugger
eco-dude showed.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.519
Told me he was conducting
some wildlife survey.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.782
Gave me $500 cash
to take off for a week.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.611
Can you describe
this tree hugger eco-dude?Totally.

19:37.654 --> 19:41.267
Haole.Kind of regular height,
regular hair.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.181
All right, you
just described him.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.486
Give me specifics.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.749
I was looking
at the money, brah.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.968
We pinned him down on
the date this happened.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.492
It was the day before
Amanda was taken.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.060
And plus, the guy was
driving an ATV, right?

19:52.103 --> 19:56.107
Yeah, a-a quad. Like, brand-new.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.980
Well, look,
if what he's saying is true,

19:59.023 --> 20:00.460
it had to be
Amanda's kidnapper.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.113
He was out here
setting up the prison.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.594
The tracks are down there.
If your lab can identify

20:04.638 --> 20:06.596
the model, well,
maybe can you trace them.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.598
Maybe.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.557
There's only about a dozen
sellers on the island.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.776
Even fewer that rent,
mostly to tourists.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.475
We'd have to contact
all of them directly.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.738
TC can help
with the tour places.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.305
They always refer business
to him and vice versa.

20:19.348 --> 20:22.003
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.616
I'm thinking he's
telling the truth.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.488
I'm inclined to agree,
but we need confirmation.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.273
Let's get it.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.844
[phone camera clicks]

20:39.281 --> 20:43.154
I didn't see much, but, um,

20:43.198 --> 20:46.288
the man who took me was white.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.247
Older.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.729
Amanda, hi.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.166
Detective Katsumoto,
you remember me?

20:55.210 --> 20:58.257
A-Amanda?You okay?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.695
I'm sorry, is
something the matter?

21:03.305 --> 21:04.393
What's wrong,
sweetheart?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.744
It's your badge.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.703
My badge?

21:09.746 --> 21:13.489
Amanda, was the man
who took you a-a cop?

21:21.236 --> 21:23.151
No wonder she wouldn't talk.
She was afraid of us.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.893
The badge could've been a fake.Yeah, but what if it wasn't?

21:25.936 --> 21:28.243
Until we know for sure
that a cop wasn't involved,

21:28.287 --> 21:29.897
we have to keep
everything quiet.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.334
The bunker, the-the ATV,
all of it.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.771
How are you gonna contain this?
What about CSU?

21:34.815 --> 21:38.253
I have people I trust.
They'll process the bunker

21:38.297 --> 21:39.994
and report their findings
only to me.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.212
Okay.
All right.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.867
I find out anything,
I'll loop you in.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.086
Same.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.002
Hey, Magnum.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.134
Tell her I'm sorry.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.281
[crying]

22:10.894 --> 22:15.072
I thought I was
getting better.

22:15.116 --> 22:19.338
I'm just so damn tired
of being afraid all the time.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.473
You know, my, uh,

22:24.517 --> 22:27.737
my father
once said that

22:27.781 --> 22:29.826
being brave doesn't mean
not being scared.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.393
It just means you've
decided there's something

22:31.437 --> 22:33.352
more important
than your fear.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.703
Like what?

22:38.052 --> 22:41.185
When I was
held captive,

22:41.229 --> 22:43.884
I wasn't exactly
a model prisoner.

22:43.927 --> 22:47.496
I tried to steal a radio,
I tried to steal a gun.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.500
So the guards, they...
threw me in the hole.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.503
It was dark and lonely,

22:54.547 --> 22:57.637
and I felt like any day

22:57.680 --> 23:00.074
could be my last.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.467
I was scared.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.469
You were?

23:04.600 --> 23:07.690
Yeah.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.650
For all I knew, my friends
could've been worse off than me,

23:10.693 --> 23:13.609
so I decided
that those guys

23:13.653 --> 23:16.220
were more important
than my fear.

23:16.264 --> 23:19.528
If I could just...

23:19.572 --> 23:21.225
survive,

23:21.269 --> 23:25.142
I could help
them escape.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.317
And we did.

23:28.624 --> 23:33.107
Look, Amanda,
you're scared,

23:33.150 --> 23:36.197
I understand that,
but you're also brave.

23:36.240 --> 23:40.593
Not a lot of people could
have done what you did.

23:40.636 --> 23:44.771
And not many people
can handle

23:44.814 --> 23:48.165
what you're going
through right now.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.340
You should know that.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.434
[over phone]:
â™ª Yeah

23:55.477 --> 23:58.480
â™ª I'm a midnight mover

23:58.524 --> 23:59.742
I'm sorry,
I got to take this.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.527
â™ª All night... [beeps]

24:01.570 --> 24:03.616
TC, what do you got?

24:03.659 --> 24:06.096
MAGNUM:
What TC had was a lead.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.925
Turns out a handful of ATVs
were rented out

24:08.969 --> 24:10.710
for a period
of six or more days

24:10.753 --> 24:12.538
around the time Amanda
was kidnapped.

24:12.581 --> 24:15.062
And lucky for us, the people
who rented them all out

24:15.105 --> 24:17.151
had to give local addresses.

24:24.811 --> 24:26.029
Okay, this one

24:26.073 --> 24:27.944
is owned by a property
management company.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.556
They do short-term leases
with a six-week minimum.

24:30.599 --> 24:31.861
I feel good about
this one, Higgins.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.297
Good vibes.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.864
Yeah, you said that about
the last three, you realize.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.519
Let me explain something to you
about following leads...

24:37.563 --> 24:39.347
Oh, you're gonna mansplain
something? How wonderful for me.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.175
No, I'm gonna P.I.-splain
something to you.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.525
The thing about following leads
is most of them don't pan out,

24:43.569 --> 24:45.309
right? So you got
to be optimistic.

24:45.353 --> 24:46.920
Otherwise, you're gonna
be miserable in this job.

24:46.963 --> 24:47.834
[knocking on door]

24:51.446 --> 24:53.753

24:53.796 --> 24:55.494
Looks like we're gonna
have to let ourselves in.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.547
We're wasting valuable time.

25:05.591 --> 25:07.027
You want to give it a shot?
Be my guest.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.595
Sure. Move.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.075
See, the-the
problem with these

25:12.119 --> 25:13.686
short-term lease
companies

25:13.729 --> 25:15.992
is they tend to lubricate
the locks,

25:16.036 --> 25:17.341
which makes the pins
really slippery

25:17.385 --> 25:18.821
and it makes it
really hard to...

25:18.865 --> 25:21.258
You were saying something?

25:21.302 --> 25:24.087
You don't have
to enjoy it so much, okay?

25:24.131 --> 25:25.219
Sure, I do.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.619
I think this
is the place.

25:36.970 --> 25:40.626
Surveillance photos
of the Sakos.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.366
It's a map
of their neighborhood.

25:43.803 --> 25:44.891
Alan and Mari's
daily schedule.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.680
The whole family's
under a microscope.

25:51.724 --> 25:53.726
Why?I don't know,

25:53.769 --> 25:54.683
but these pictures
were taken yesterday.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.905
They're still being watched.

25:58.948 --> 26:00.950
We have to contact Alan
and Mari right away

26:00.994 --> 26:02.604
because whatever this
abduction was about,

26:02.648 --> 26:04.737
it's not over.

26:04.780 --> 26:06.521

26:20.666 --> 26:22.493
Wh-Why did he take my mom?We don't know why.

26:22.537 --> 26:24.321
Where's my dad?
I-I want my dad right now.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.758
He's in Pearl City,
okay?

26:25.801 --> 26:27.847
Rick and TC have taken
a helicopter to get him,

26:27.890 --> 26:29.326
so he'll be here
really soon.

26:29.370 --> 26:32.068
Don't worry.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.374
Amanda, listen to me.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.898
We're gonna
find your mom.

26:35.942 --> 26:37.465
We're gonna find her
and bring her home, okay?

26:42.688 --> 26:44.472
Anything?Maybe.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.649
Amanda, um...

26:48.781 --> 26:51.131
I'm sorry, I have to ask you,

26:51.174 --> 26:55.483
does this man look familiar?

26:55.526 --> 26:57.746
That's... that's him.
That's him!

26:57.790 --> 26:59.313
Kumu, would you mind?

26:59.356 --> 27:01.489
Come on, honey. Let's go
into the main house.

27:01.532 --> 27:03.534
It's okay, I'll come see you.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.627
Mr. Magnum...

27:08.670 --> 27:09.976
We're gonna find your mom.

27:10.019 --> 27:11.934
I promise.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.418
You should know better than
to make that kind of promise.

27:17.461 --> 27:23.119
Right now that girl needs hope.

27:23.163 --> 27:25.034
Who's the guy?

27:25.078 --> 27:27.471
Nicholas Warner.

27:27.515 --> 27:30.736
CSU found one of his
prints in the bunker.

27:30.779 --> 27:32.781
Several violent felonies
in New York.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.348
He arrived on the island
six weeks ago

27:34.391 --> 27:36.045
with a guy named
Benjamin Keeble.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.438
So there's
two kidnappers?

27:37.481 --> 27:41.050
First Amanda gets taken,
and now her mum.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.965
I mean, what the bloody hell
is going on?

27:43.009 --> 27:44.401
What do they want
with this family?

27:44.445 --> 27:46.752
I don't know, but a neighbor
saw a gray van

27:46.795 --> 27:48.971
outside their house around
the time Mari was grabbed.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.016
I'm hoping, with this ID,

27:50.059 --> 27:52.627
we can track it.We want to help.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.369
I can't have you involved.But we're already involved.

27:55.412 --> 27:56.979
Now that we know
these guys aren't HPD,

27:57.023 --> 27:59.286
you need to stand down.

27:59.329 --> 28:00.679
I'm also gonna need
that laptop you found.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.725
What laptop?

28:03.769 --> 28:04.987
Come on, really?

28:05.031 --> 28:06.641
The one you found
at the rental house

28:06.685 --> 28:07.903
with the
surveillance photos.

28:07.947 --> 28:11.037
Look... you wouldn't
even have that ID

28:11.080 --> 28:12.995
were it not for us.

28:14.344 --> 28:15.563
All right.

28:15.606 --> 28:18.305
I'll allow you
to go over the laptop,

28:18.348 --> 28:19.698
but you tell me
everything you find.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.917
Deal.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.223
You won't regret this.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.398
Already do.

Hello? Hello?

28:29.795 --> 28:30.796
Alan!Mari?

28:30.839 --> 28:32.014
Oh, my God, where are you?

28:32.058 --> 28:33.537
We have your wife, Mr. Sako.

28:33.581 --> 28:34.930
You want to see her again,

28:34.974 --> 28:36.889
you'll do exactly
what we tell you.

28:36.932 --> 28:38.412
Do you understand?

28:38.455 --> 28:39.805
MAGNUM:
We've got a problem.

28:39.848 --> 28:41.502
Rick and TC just called.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.983
Alan Sako didn't show and now
he's not answering his phone.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.549
That's odd.
Yeah.

28:45.593 --> 28:47.900
Could you ping his cell?Yeah.

28:55.603 --> 28:58.432
He's at his office downtown.

28:58.475 --> 28:59.607
His wife's just been abducted.

28:59.650 --> 29:01.000
Why is he going back to work?

29:01.043 --> 29:03.611
MAGNUM: First his daughter,
now his wife.

29:03.654 --> 29:04.873
Maybe someone's trying
to get to Alan,

29:04.917 --> 29:07.136
trying to use his
family as leverage

29:07.180 --> 29:08.703
to try to get him
to do something.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.792
He's an I.T. consultant.
Get him to do what?

29:10.836 --> 29:12.533
I don't know,
but we should get over there.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.664
If he's in contact
with the kidnappers,

29:13.708 --> 29:14.578
that could help us find them.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.062

This is interesting.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.729
What's that?

29:34.773 --> 29:37.863
Amanda's kidnappers were tapping
into the surveillance cameras

29:37.906 --> 29:39.865
in Alan's work building.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.432
Fortunately, their stream
is still live.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.651
MAGNUM:
Any sign of Alan?

29:43.694 --> 29:45.479
Uh... Yeah, got him.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.568
Okay, he's on the 14th floor.
He's on the phone.

29:47.611 --> 29:48.917
He looks nervous.

29:48.961 --> 29:50.484
He's got to be on
with the kidnappers.

29:50.527 --> 29:51.877
Something is definitely
going down.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.574
Perfect. We lost visual.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.975
Do you have him yet?

30:03.018 --> 30:05.542
No, but I think I might know
what this is about.

30:05.586 --> 30:08.545
I've just found
extensive intel

30:08.589 --> 30:11.026
on Andrew Gore in here.
His schedules and the like.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.462
Who?

30:12.506 --> 30:14.290
He's the U.S. Attorney
for Hawaii.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.465
He's been building
a major case

30:15.509 --> 30:17.946
against a Chinese triad
here in Honolulu.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.992
What's that got
to do with Alan?

30:20.035 --> 30:22.124
For the past few months,
Gore has been traveling around,

30:22.168 --> 30:23.299
interviewing witnesses
in different cities, right?

30:23.343 --> 30:24.735
But when he's here in Honolulu,

30:24.779 --> 30:26.868
he works out
of an office

30:26.912 --> 30:28.739
in Alan's building.

30:28.783 --> 30:31.220
The one constant, however,
is his security detail,

30:31.264 --> 30:33.570
which is, you know, 24/7,
as you would imagine.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.877
Are you about to tell me that
this is all potentially tied

30:35.921 --> 30:37.226
to a-a possible hit?

30:37.270 --> 30:38.619
Just a theory,
but consider this:

30:38.662 --> 30:41.013
according to Gore's
schedule here,

30:41.056 --> 30:44.059
he was in the building at the
time of Amanda's kidnapping,

30:44.103 --> 30:45.539
and he's back there again today.

30:45.582 --> 30:47.715
I think Amanda's kidnappers

30:47.758 --> 30:49.717
took her in order
to leverage Alan

30:49.760 --> 30:52.285
to help them kill Gore.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.895
But, you know,
when Amanda escaped...

30:53.939 --> 30:56.767
They had to wait until
Gore got back to try again.

30:56.811 --> 30:59.858
Right, I mean, if someone
is making a play for Gore,

30:59.901 --> 31:01.511
then they might be needing
Alan to neutralize

31:01.555 --> 31:03.035
certain security measures
in the building.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.037
Or they plan to use him
in a more direct way.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.690
How do you mean?

31:06.734 --> 31:08.779
Alan is the building's
I.T. guy, right?Right.

31:08.823 --> 31:10.651
So, he has access
to any part of the building

31:10.694 --> 31:12.218
without raising suspicion.

31:12.261 --> 31:13.697
He can get close to anyone.

31:16.048 --> 31:18.789
You think they're gonna force
Alan to kill Gore?

33:33.228 --> 33:35.013
Hurry up and take
those clothes off.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.318
Eyes on the monitor.

33:36.362 --> 33:38.320
Oh, really? Please.

33:43.412 --> 33:46.285
[metal detector beeps, whirs]

33:51.768 --> 33:53.031
[indistinct chatter]

33:55.511 --> 33:56.947
If you're thinking
about saying something...

33:56.991 --> 34:00.255
don't. That wouldn't
be good for Mari.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.609
[metal detector beeps]It's okay.

34:06.653 --> 34:09.351
This thing is supersensitive.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.415
Mahalo.Have a good day.

34:31.765 --> 34:33.636

[phone rings]

34:40.339 --> 34:41.340
MAGNUM:
Katsumoto.

34:41.383 --> 34:43.516
We got a lead on the kidnappers.

34:43.559 --> 34:46.301
We tracked the van to a house
in Ewa Beach. We're going in.

34:46.345 --> 34:49.435
I wanted you to know.
Where are you, anyway?

34:49.478 --> 34:52.046
Thanks. Be safe.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.572
[elevator bell chimes]

35:13.633 --> 35:15.548
[indistinct chatter]

35:24.470 --> 35:26.602
MAN:
A.G. is on the move.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.789
You don't have to do this.

35:39.833 --> 35:41.313
They're gonna kill her
if I don't.

35:41.356 --> 35:43.576
HPD is moving in on the
kidnappers as we speak.

35:45.578 --> 35:46.361
WOMAN:
This way, Mr. Gore.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.581
It's gonna be okay.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.104
Trust me.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.497
[elevator bell chimes]

35:51.540 --> 35:54.108
MAN:
A.G. is approaching
the elevator.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.601
Back open!HPD! Down on your knees!

36:10.342 --> 36:12.126
You, don't move! Contact!

36:12.170 --> 36:13.954
You did the right thing.

36:13.997 --> 36:15.564
[phone rings]

36:16.957 --> 36:19.220
Katsumoto. What happened?

36:19.264 --> 36:21.527
They drew, Magnum.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.790
They drew on a damn SWAT team.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.619
We had to take them out.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.621
A-And what about...

36:28.664 --> 36:30.536
what about Amanda's mother?

36:33.278 --> 36:35.149
Katsumoto?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.151
Katsumoto?

36:37.195 --> 36:38.631
We searched the house.
There's no sign of her.

36:38.674 --> 36:39.893
We don't know where she is.

36:49.511 --> 36:50.556
I don't get it.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.558
She was with them
when I spoke to her.

36:52.601 --> 36:54.255
She was right
there next to him.

36:54.299 --> 36:56.431
We're gonna find her.[sighs]

36:56.475 --> 36:58.651
[dialing]

36:58.694 --> 37:00.261
Higgins.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.220
The man you saw talking
to Alan before.

37:02.263 --> 37:03.525
The man with glasses, yes.

37:03.569 --> 37:04.918
I need you to find him
right away.

37:13.927 --> 37:15.363
Where is she?Where's who?

37:15.407 --> 37:16.843
You know damn well
who. Mari Sako.

37:16.886 --> 37:18.627
I don't know a Mari.

37:18.671 --> 37:19.889
Magnum, stop.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.935
[groans]

37:21.978 --> 37:25.547
Listen, your friends are dead.

37:25.591 --> 37:28.811
HPD is on their way.
You have one move here.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.684
Cooperate.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.686
Screw you.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.209
Proceed.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.648
Where is Mari Sako?
Where is she?

37:39.692 --> 37:42.172
[groans] Okay, okay.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.837
I don't see anything. You sure
this guy's telling the truth?

38:02.105 --> 38:03.542
Right there.

38:03.585 --> 38:04.804
Look.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.414
He said he buried her.
That's got to be it.

38:08.111 --> 38:10.288
TC, take us down.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.382
Go, go, go, go!

38:29.307 --> 38:32.005
Mari! Mari, can you hear me?

38:38.272 --> 38:39.491
[clangs]

38:39.534 --> 38:41.014
You got something.Keep going!

38:41.057 --> 38:41.710
Keep going, Magnum.

38:43.756 --> 38:46.411
Mari!

38:46.454 --> 38:49.501
Mari, can you hear me? Mari!Give me that, pretty boy.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.895
Come on, we're nearly there.

38:52.939 --> 38:54.897
Make sure it doesn't collapse.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.682
TC:
You're almost there! One more.

38:56.725 --> 38:58.379
We're nearly there.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.554
Hang on.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.646
Three.[all grunt]

39:04.690 --> 39:06.518
[gasping]Mari.

39:06.561 --> 39:09.825
You're safe. Come on.
Oh, look at you.

Oh, Mama!

39:55.567 --> 39:58.178
â™ª

40:21.636 --> 40:23.943
You kept me in the
dark about Alan.

40:23.986 --> 40:26.293
I did.

40:26.336 --> 40:29.165
I'm still mad, but let's
say we forget about that.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.906
Done.

40:30.950 --> 40:32.865
Come on, you don't want
to hug it out?

40:32.908 --> 40:33.605
Not at all.[laughs]

40:36.390 --> 40:37.609
Thank you, Ms. Higgins.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.480
