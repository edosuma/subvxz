five days in captivity,

dark, windowless place.

10:21.925 --> 10:24.667
Both hands were zip-tied.

And he had her deep in
the woods, somewhere out there.

You have no idea where.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.503
they all came from
somewhere east of here.

10:34.546 --> 10:37.680
Now, we think after she escaped,
she ran for two to three hours,

10:37.724 --> 10:39.290
which means
she could have traveled

10:39.334 --> 10:40.901
up to a dozen miles that night.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.685
So your search grid

10:42.729 --> 10:43.904
at least a hundred square miles.

10:43.947 --> 10:47.516

there is nothing more empowering
than your body achieving

11:22.899 --> 11:25.554

11:25.597 --> 11:27.164
It's not that easy.

11:27.208 --> 11:28.731
Nothing is.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.734
You cannot let

of the rest of your life.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.739

11:52.407 --> 11:54.714
And I, too,
have some unpleasant ones.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.154
[sighs]:
Oh, God.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.982
How do...

12:02.025 --> 12:06.726
I told you, I don't just
do this to stay in shape.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.597
[chuckles softly]

12:08.640 --> 12:10.817
[grunts]
No.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.297
No. No. No.
[laughs]
Nearly.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.212
[both laugh]

12:18.520 --> 12:19.826
[knocking on door]

12:21.479 --> 12:22.654
Hey.

12:22.698 --> 12:24.482
Is Amanda okay?

12:24.526 --> 12:25.875
Yes.

12:25.919 --> 12:29.749
Um, and I think
she's ready to talk.

12:38.061 --> 12:41.717
There's a lot I don't remember.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.762
Just tell us
what you do remember.

12:47.636 --> 12:51.031
AMANDA:
I couldn't get my hands free.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.424
Finally,
I-I dislocated my thumb. [thumb cracks, Amanda screams]

12:53.468 --> 12:55.296
[exhales]

12:55.339 --> 12:58.212
I had no idea where I was.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.954
I just kept running,
as fast as I could.

13:00.997 --> 13:04.784
And I found that man's house.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.877
I don't remember much else.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.531
You are a very strong
young woman.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.229
[scoffs]

13:15.272 --> 13:17.057
No, Higgins is right.

13:17.100 --> 13:20.712
You know, when I was
a prisoner in Afghanistan,

13:20.756 --> 13:22.105
it was my obligation
to try to escape.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.107
Not to mention
I had three weeks

13:24.151 --> 13:25.761
of naval training
on how to do it.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.242
I had three guys with me.

13:28.285 --> 13:31.288
You had the courage
to escape all by yourself.

13:37.294 --> 13:38.643
Can you do something for me?

13:40.384 --> 13:42.343
I'd like you to close your eyes.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.040
Wh-Why?

13:44.084 --> 13:46.913
Well, when we escaped,
the Special Ops guys

13:46.956 --> 13:49.132
had me do
this exercise to help

13:49.176 --> 13:52.483
recall the details
of the camp that I was at.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.094
It helped pinpoint its location.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.705
I'd like to do
the same thing with you.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.707
[exhales]

13:58.750 --> 14:02.450
Okay, so just relax.

14:02.493 --> 14:05.061
Think about the very first step
you took outside.

14:05.105 --> 14:09.283
Not just what you saw,
but smell,

14:09.326 --> 14:12.416
hear, touch.
Everything matters.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.288
[panting]

14:14.331 --> 14:17.247
Was there a breeze?
Maybe some trade winds?

14:19.684 --> 14:24.254
No, uh... there was a smell.

14:24.298 --> 14:27.649
Almost like mint.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.433
Or pine.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.173
Eucalyptus?

14:32.088 --> 14:35.831
Okay. So you went through the
woods, you smelled eucalyptus.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.485
What else?

14:37.528 --> 14:39.661
AMANDA:
There was this plant,

14:39.704 --> 14:41.228
wi-with a weird seed.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.794
Weird how?

14:42.838 --> 14:47.799
Big, like the, the size
of a cell phone, almost.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.106
Mm. Sounds like an uhiuhi tree.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.675
Also known as
a Mezoneuron kavaiense.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.809
Yeah. That's-that's it.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.942
Uhiuhi?
I've never heard of it.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.118
It's almost extinct in the wild.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.728
It's very rare.MAGNUM: Where
does it grow?

15:03.772 --> 15:06.383
On Oahu? Only the leeward side.

15:06.427 --> 15:07.428
Leeward?

15:07.471 --> 15:08.820
What?

15:08.864 --> 15:11.171
HPD focused
their search on the east,

15:11.214 --> 15:12.389
which is where they thought

15:12.433 --> 15:13.738
Amanda came from,
but if that flower

15:13.782 --> 15:15.653
only grows on the leeward side,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.351
uh, she didn't come
from the east.

15:17.394 --> 15:18.700
She came from the west.

15:18.743 --> 15:19.570
They were looking
in the wrong place.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.796
I've swept
the northeast quadrant.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.972
No signs of any structure.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.756
But there's heavy tree cover.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.671
Monkey pod trees everywhere.

15:33.715 --> 15:35.586
I'm gonna head south.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.023
Roger that.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.416
Northeast quadrant
swept, moving south.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.815
What do you think?

15:46.858 --> 15:47.598
Anything look familiar?

15:47.642 --> 15:49.905
No. Nothing.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.515
Be patient.

15:51.559 --> 15:52.821
Ah, little tense.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.344
You know what I think you need?

15:54.388 --> 15:55.824
I think you should do more yoga.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.695
Maybe, uh, maybe Dogface Pose?

15:57.739 --> 15:58.958
[pants]

15:59.001 --> 16:00.220
That's not a pose.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.961
Yeah, it is.
I'm pretty sure it is.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.266
I'll ask Higgins to show you.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.702
She loves
watching people suffer.Lucky me.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.490
Haven't had to hump it like
this since we fled the Korengal.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.187
The Korengal Valley.

16:11.231 --> 16:12.710
Where you were imprisoned?

16:12.754 --> 16:15.061
I cannot imagine
what that was like.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.237
Yeah. Good times.
Great memories.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.500
I'm glad you had each other,
at least.

16:19.543 --> 16:22.459
Well, not always. When we were
there, they liked to put Thomas

16:22.503 --> 16:24.896
in solitary confinement
for long stretches.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.550
Yeah, when he was there,

16:26.594 --> 16:28.683
we didn't know if he
was dead or alive.

16:28.726 --> 16:31.947
Uh, Frisky Rabbit pose,
and I Just Threw Up pose.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.558
AMANDA [chuckles]: Gross.TC: Yo, Orville!

16:34.602 --> 16:35.907
I may have something.

16:35.951 --> 16:36.865
Thomas!

16:38.171 --> 16:39.824
What do you see?

16:39.868 --> 16:41.565
I got an odd patch of dark green

16:41.609 --> 16:45.091
about six klicks south
of your position.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.528
Amanda said the place
was cement, right?

16:47.571 --> 16:49.269
Cement holds moisture.
It can cause the-the plants

16:49.312 --> 16:51.923
around it to grow more lush.All right.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.142
Send the coordinates.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.148
Look.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.237
RICK: Must be
from World War II.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.690
I'm gonna have a look around.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.218
Thomas.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.053
This is it.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.010
HIGGINS:
Magnum?

17:37.665 --> 17:39.058
I think I found something.

17:41.712 --> 17:43.671
Looks like ATV tracks.Mm.

17:43.714 --> 17:45.586
You think they belong
to the kidnapper?

17:45.629 --> 17:47.718
Would they be here
after six weeks?

17:47.762 --> 17:49.720
Well, this part of the island
hasn't see much rain

17:49.764 --> 17:52.593
in the last few weeks,
so it's certainly possible.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.377
[rustling]What was that?

17:58.947 --> 18:00.383
[panting]

18:00.427 --> 18:01.471
Hey!

18:04.866 --> 18:07.042
Flank him!Yeah.

18:26.409 --> 18:28.933
[grunting]

18:28.977 --> 18:30.979
Nice tackle.Yeah, thanks.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.937
[panting]

18:32.981 --> 18:33.808
Let's chat, shall we?

18:40.075 --> 18:41.511
[engines whirring]

18:44.862 --> 18:46.777
[engines stop]

18:46.821 --> 18:49.215
Start processing.Yes, sir.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.522
You didn't question him,
did you?

18:52.566 --> 18:56.047
Uh, well, we had a
lot of time to kill.

18:56.091 --> 18:57.658
You can be mad
at me later.

18:57.701 --> 19:00.051
Carter Ning, this is
Detective Katsumoto.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.793
Carter's been staying
in this bunker for the
past several months.

19:02.837 --> 19:05.056
He's homeless. He said
the only reason why he ran

19:05.100 --> 19:06.754
is 'cause he thought
we were cops, and he's got

19:06.797 --> 19:08.277
this possession charge
hanging over him.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.323
I'm gonna ask once:
you kidnap this girl?

19:10.366 --> 19:11.759
No.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.283
You didn't even
look at it.No. No way. I...

19:14.327 --> 19:15.458
I never
seen her before.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.068
Carter, tell him
what you told us.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.941
Okay. Sure.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.334
Which part?

19:21.377 --> 19:24.815
About what happened here
six weeks ago, genius.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.730
Right, yeah, uh, okay.

19:26.774 --> 19:29.733
This tree hugger
eco-dude showed.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.519
Told me he was conducting
some wildlife survey.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.782
Gave me $500 cash
to take off for a week.

19:34.825 --> 19:37.611
Can you describe
this tree hugger eco-dude?Totally.

19:37.654 --> 19:41.267
Haole.Kind of regular height,
regular hair.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.181
All right, you
just described him.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.486
Give me specifics.

19:43.530 --> 19:45.749
I was looking
at the money, brah.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.968
We pinned him down on
the date this happened.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.492
It was the day before
Amanda was taken.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.060
And plus, the guy was
driving an ATV, right?

19:52.103 --> 19:56.107
Yeah, a-a quad. Like, brand-new.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.980
Well, look,
if what he's saying is true,

19:59.023 --> 20:00.460
it had to be
Amanda's kidnapper.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.113
He was out here
setting up the prison.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.594
The tracks are down there.
If your lab can identify

20:04.638 --> 20:06.596
the model, well,
maybe can you trace them.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.598
Maybe.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.557
There's only about a dozen
sellers on the island.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.776
Even fewer that rent,
mostly to tourists.

20:12.820 --> 20:15.475
We'd have to contact
all of them directly.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.738
TC can help
with the tour places.

20:17.781 --> 20:19.305
They always refer business
to him and vice versa.

20:19.348 --> 20:22.003
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.616
I'm thinking he's
telling the truth.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.488
I'm inclined to agree,
but we need confirmation.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.273
Let's get it.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.844
[phone camera clicks]

20:39.281 --> 20:43.154
I didn't see much, but, um,

20:43.198 --> 20:46.288
the man who took me was white.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.247
Older.

20:51.162 --> 20:52.729
Amanda, hi.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.166
Detective Katsumoto,
you remember me?

20:55.210 --> 20:58.257
A-Amanda?You okay?

20:59.954 --> 21:01.695
I'm sorry, is
something the matter?

21:03.305 --> 21:04.393
What's wrong,
sweetheart?

21:05.960 --> 21:07.744
It's your badge.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.703
My badge?

21:09.746 --> 21:13.489
Amanda, was the man
who took you a-a cop?

21:21.236 --> 21:23.151
No wonder she wouldn't talk.
She was afraid of us.

21:23.194 --> 21:25.893
The badge could've been a fake.Yeah, but what if it wasn't?

21:25.936 --> 21:28.243
Until we know for sure
that a cop wasn't involved,

21:28.287 --> 21:29.897
we have to keep
everything quiet.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.334
The bunker, the-the ATV,
all of it.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.771
How are you gonna contain this?
What about CSU?

21:34.815 --> 21:38.253
I have people I trust.
They'll process the bunker

21:38.297 --> 21:39.994
and report their findings
only to me.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.212
Okay.
All right.

21:41.256 --> 21:43.867
I find out anything,
I'll loop you in.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.086
Same.

21:45.129 --> 21:48.002
Hey, Magnum.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.134
Tell her I'm sorry.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.281
[crying]

22:10.894 --> 22:15.072
I thought I was
getting better.

22:15.116 --> 22:19.338
I'm just so damn tired
of being afraid all the time.

22:21.470 --> 22:24.473
You know, my, uh,

22:24.517 --> 22:27.737
my father
once said that

22:27.781 --> 22:29.826
being brave doesn't mean
not being scared.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.393
It just means you've
decided there's something

22:31.437 --> 22:33.352
more important
than your fear.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.703
Like what?

22:38.052 --> 22:41.185
When I was
held captive,

22:41.229 --> 22:43.884
I wasn't exactly
a model prisoner.

22:43.927 --> 22:47.496
I tried to steal a radio,
I tried to steal a gun.

22:48.845 --> 22:51.500
So the guards, they...
threw me in the hole.

22:51.544 --> 22:54.503
It was dark and lonely,

22:54.547 --> 22:57.637
and I felt like any day

22:57.680 --> 23:00.074
could be my last.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.467
I was scared.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.469
You were?

23:04.600 --> 23:07.690
Yeah.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.650
For all I knew, my friends
could've been worse off than me,

23:10.693 --> 23:13.609
so I decided
that those guys

23:13.653 --> 23:16.220
were more important
than my fear.

23:16.264 --> 23:19.528
If I could just...

23:19.572 --> 23:21.225
survive,

23:21.269 --> 23:25.142
I could help
them escape.

23:25.186 --> 23:26.317
And we did.

23:28.624 --> 23:33.107
Look, Amanda,
you're scared,

23:33.150 --> 23:36.197
I understand that,
but you're also brave.

23:36.240 --> 23:40.593
Not a lot of people could
have done what you did.

23:40.636 --> 23:44.771
And not many people
can handle

23:44.814 --> 23:48.165
what you're going
through right now.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.340
You should know that.

30:41.056 --> 30:44.059
he was in the building at the

Gore got back to try again.
