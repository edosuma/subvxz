Attention, weak-minded sheep.

09:42.137 --> 09:45.972
Don't forget to buy your
Jeez-Ass t-shirts and lunch boxes.

09:46.007 --> 09:47.807
Thousands of people, mostly Mexicans,

09:47.842 --> 09:50.510
have made the pilgrimage
to see this holy hemorrhoid,

09:50.595 --> 09:55.081
what some, mostly Mexicans,
are calling a modern-day miracle.

09:55.150 --> 09:57.717
People are flocking to
see it, your excellency.

09:57.786 --> 10:00.687
Bring him to me.
What is that?

10:00.772 --> 10:02.822
Oh, you like it?
Cafe press.

10:02.891 --> 10:07.660
Here, I got you a mouse pad
and an altar boy love doll.

10:07.696 --> 10:10.780
[hard rock music playing]

10:13.962 --> 10:16.029
[groans]
[whirring]

10:17.205 --> 10:18.121
[clears throat]

10:18.206 --> 10:19.172
Excuse me.
[music stops]

10:20.508 --> 10:26.929
I got a disturbance call
about a possible murder?

10:27.015 --> 10:30.023
I just came to say it's okay.
We forgive you. Bye.

10:30.518 --> 10:35.655
You know what happened
to the last cops that came in here?

10:35.724 --> 10:38.391
How would your mother feel
about this mindless killing?

10:38.476 --> 10:40.693
Why don't you ask her?

10:41.896 --> 10:43.029
[gulps]

10:43.064 --> 10:44.897
I know what we should do to this cop.

10:44.983 --> 10:47.483
- Jerk him off.
- What the [bleep], Rodney?

10:47.569 --> 10:50.119
- Why would we do that?
- To teach him a lesson.

10:50.205 --> 10:52.972
What lesson?
That Satan's BFFs give handjobs

10:53.041 --> 10:54.641
to every dude that comes in here?

10:54.709 --> 10:57.627
- So we're on the same page?
- Shut up, Rodney!

10:57.712 --> 11:01.414
We're gonna give this
guy a dirt slide ride.

11:01.483 --> 11:03.516
Hey, that sounds fun!

11:03.585 --> 11:05.752
This isn't fun.
[engine revving]

11:05.837 --> 11:07.587
[screams]

11:07.672 --> 11:10.306
<i>Wait, wait, stop, stop.
It's important.</i>

11:10.392 --> 11:14.560
- What's so important?
- I-I need to run to my car for a second.

11:14.629 --> 11:16.229
I forgot to set the parking brake.

11:16.297 --> 11:18.297
Yeah, we're not gonna fall for that.

11:18.366 --> 11:21.267
[laughter]

11:21.353 --> 11:22.935
[explosion]

11:22.987 --> 11:26.606
We're gonna murder you, pig!
Where'd he go?

11:26.691 --> 11:28.157
I don't mean to be an asshole,

11:28.243 --> 11:32.745
but this wouldn't have happened
if we'd went with plan J-O.

11:32.781 --> 11:34.280
Looking great.

11:34.349 --> 11:37.250
That'll be 50 bucks and
all of your self-respect.

11:37.285 --> 11:39.919
[sobbing] I'm not worthy to
look upon your face.

11:39.988 --> 11:42.651
I love you, Jesus!
Mwah.

11:44.509 --> 11:46.459
You must be the
prophet, Woody Johnson.

11:46.544 --> 11:48.461
Yup, doing God's work here.

11:48.513 --> 11:51.297
[blubbering]

11:51.383 --> 11:53.433
I've been sent here by
his holiness, the Pope.

11:53.468 --> 11:55.134
The pontiff wants to
verify your hemorrhoid

11:55.220 --> 11:57.720
as a true miracle.
He requests that you come with me

11:57.806 --> 12:00.473
- to the Vatican at once.
- Did you hear that, Malloy?

12:00.558 --> 12:02.975
We're going to the
Vatican to meet the Pope.

12:03.061 --> 12:04.360
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

12:04.446 --> 12:05.978
Haven't you ever read
any of those horrible

12:06.030 --> 12:08.815
- Dan Brown novels?
- Don't be silly. It's a great idea.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.734
- Hey, Cardinal, how are we getting there?
- To the pope jet.

12:11.820 --> 12:15.238
[excited music]

12:18.410 --> 12:20.243
The Pope will meet you
first thing in the morning

12:20.328 --> 12:23.129
for the vetting process.
If everything goes well,

12:23.198 --> 12:25.565
your hemorrhoid will be
verified as a true miracle.

12:25.633 --> 12:28.167
And what happens if it's not?

12:28.236 --> 12:29.669
Well, according to biblical law,

12:29.738 --> 12:32.638
a false witness who breathes out lies
must be punished.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.974
- Oh, shit.
- I'm not worried,

12:35.009 --> 12:37.226
'cause this 100% real, right, Malloy?

12:37.312 --> 12:39.729
As real as every story in the Bible.

12:39.814 --> 12:43.399
As guests of his excellency,
I urge you to make yourselves at home.

12:43.485 --> 12:44.984
What are you doing?

12:45.019 --> 12:48.654
Oh, I just noticed that your ceiling
needed some restoration.

12:48.690 --> 12:51.491
Holy crap, the Ark of the Covenant.

12:51.526 --> 12:54.110
Watch this, Malloy. Hey, you!

12:54.195 --> 12:55.862
[screaming]

12:55.947 --> 12:57.363
[laughs]

12:57.415 --> 12:59.321
Got him.

13:01.202 --> 13:03.503
- They'll never find me here.
- Who won't find you?

13:03.571 --> 13:04.537
[engine revving]

13:04.606 --> 13:05.571
[yelps]

13:05.640 --> 13:06.873
Quick, call the cops.

13:06.941 --> 13:09.308
- You are the cops!
- Oh, yeah.

13:09.377 --> 13:12.962
Briggs, send backup.
These bikers are gonna kill me.

13:13.047 --> 13:13.980
[laughs]

13:14.048 --> 13:18.384
I was hoping they might.
You're on your own, "top cop."

13:18.453 --> 13:19.802
Don't worry, baby.

13:19.888 --> 13:24.557
Soon you'll be back
in my sweet, sweet ass.

13:24.642 --> 13:25.608
[yelps]

13:25.693 --> 13:29.662
- You blew up our clubhouse.
- And now we're gonna blow you.

13:29.731 --> 13:32.865
God damn it, Rodney!
We talked about this.

13:32.901 --> 13:35.067
- We're gonna kill him.
- Then blow him?

13:35.119 --> 13:36.235
No!

13:36.287 --> 13:38.988
These are some weird-ass
[bleep] bikers.

13:39.073 --> 13:41.407
Time to die, porky.

13:41.493 --> 13:43.876
Wait, what if I replace
your clubhouse?

13:43.912 --> 13:46.078
- With what?
- How about this place?

13:46.164 --> 13:49.882
If you let me live, you
can have the ranger station.

13:49.918 --> 13:52.552
Hmm, nice Feng Shui.

13:52.587 --> 13:56.339
Open concept, exposed brick.
You got a deal.

13:56.424 --> 13:58.558
I guess the piggy gets
to live another day,

13:58.626 --> 14:02.395
But he still needs to learn a lesson.
Where'd he go?

14:02.463 --> 14:05.815
- I'm teaching him a lesson, boss.
- It's a good one!

14:07.311 --> 14:10.712
<i>[whoops]
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! </i>

14:10.781 --> 14:12.547
Well, you wanted
more crime in the park.

14:12.616 --> 14:16.217
- You got it, Steve.
- Sorry, guys. This is all my fault.

14:16.286 --> 14:18.620
Maybe we should just find
a new park to work at.

14:18.705 --> 14:21.257
- I hear Six Flags is hiring.
- Oh, don't be a pussy, Steve.

14:21.258 --> 14:22.424
What would your dad say?

14:22.492 --> 14:25.126
Yeah, Steve, this
park is our jurisdiction.

14:25.195 --> 14:29.130
- We're the cops here.
- Yeah, and it's up to us to bust them!

14:29.199 --> 14:30.632
[shouts]

14:30.717 --> 14:31.633
[punches thwacking]

14:31.701 --> 14:32.744
[grunts]

14:34.337 --> 14:37.272
Ooh, I'm so excited
to meet the Pope, Malloy.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.541
<i>- Malloy?
- Woody, my son.</i>

14:39.609 --> 14:41.075
Oh, hey, what up, Jesus?

14:41.144 --> 14:42.510
<i>When you meet the Pope today,</i>

14:42.579 --> 14:45.513
<i>there's a chance he may lock you up
and throw away the key.</i>

14:45.582 --> 14:48.116
- Why would he do that?
- That's not important.

14:48.185 --> 14:50.084
<i>Just remember to tell
them that your bear cub</i>

14:50.153 --> 14:51.986
<i>had nothing to do with this scheme.</i>

14:52.072 --> 14:53.872
Scheme? What scheme?

14:53.957 --> 14:56.357
<i>- Over and out, my son.
- Malloy!</i>

14:56.426 --> 14:59.093
You tricked me.
This whole thing is a lie?

14:59.162 --> 15:00.495
Holy shit.

15:00.564 --> 15:03.131
The Pope will probably
send us to Vatican prison!

15:03.200 --> 15:05.267
We got to get out of here!

15:05.535 --> 15:08.270
His excellency will see you now.

15:09.339 --> 15:12.274
What the hell is
Renee Zellweger doing here?

15:12.742 --> 15:15.760
[hard rock music]

15:15.846 --> 15:17.562
[engine revving]

15:17.647 --> 15:21.082
Hey! That's my dad.
Give that back!

15:21.151 --> 15:22.584
[yells and groans]

15:22.652 --> 15:25.520
I should've known I couldn't be a cop.

15:25.572 --> 15:28.456
I'm sorry I couldn't
make you proud, Dad.

15:28.525 --> 15:31.459
<i>You make me proud every day, son.</i>

15:31.528 --> 15:33.528
[screams]

15:33.580 --> 15:34.496
Dad?

15:37.000 --> 15:40.118
<i>You're a Brickleberry
ranger just like I was.</i>

15:40.203 --> 15:42.420
What more could a father ask?

15:42.506 --> 15:44.289
Didn't you ever get bored here?

15:44.374 --> 15:48.760
<i>If I did, I'd just go behind a bush
and masturbate.</i>

15:48.845 --> 15:50.979
Okay.

15:51.047 --> 15:54.549
<i>Son, be proud of
yourself and what you are,</i>

15:54.618 --> 15:56.818
<i>a Brickleberry Park ranger.</i>

15:56.887 --> 16:00.955
<i>Now, get out there and
take your park back,</i>

16:01.024 --> 16:02.156
<i>and if you need me,</i>

16:02.225 --> 16:04.759
<i>I'll be jacking off behind that bush.</i>

16:04.828 --> 16:06.594
Yes, sir.

16:10.901 --> 16:13.568
[dramatic music]

16:15.906 --> 16:18.039
I was wrong for not appreciating my job.

16:18.074 --> 16:20.408
Sure, being a park ranger
can be boring and lame

16:20.460 --> 16:22.710
and put you at a high
risk for lyme disease.

16:22.746 --> 16:25.547
- Now you got me wanting to quit!
- Oh, sorry. Fog brain.

16:25.582 --> 16:26.798
You know I have lyme disease.

16:26.883 --> 16:30.685
Now, I've got a plan to get
these a-holes out of our park!

16:30.754 --> 16:33.254
Sorry, I was zoning out.
I have lyme disease.

16:33.306 --> 16:35.924
We know!
We all got lyme disease!

16:35.976 --> 16:38.974
[hard rock music]

16:41.014 --> 16:43.481
It's a good thing Ethel kept
that sign from middle school.

16:43.567 --> 16:47.769
I must have a secret admirer
who remembered my birthday.

16:47.821 --> 16:48.770
[snarling]
[screams]

16:48.855 --> 16:52.494
A cube of wolves, my only fear!

16:52.943 --> 16:54.659
Are you sure this will work?

16:54.744 --> 16:57.829
Yeah, you've been wearing
them for ten straight days.

17:01.451 --> 17:04.752
[all coughing]
[vomits]

17:04.788 --> 17:06.838
Feels like my lungs are melting.

17:11.261 --> 17:14.662
<i>Greetings, my son.
I have heard a lot about you.</i>

17:14.731 --> 17:18.398
Uh, Mr. Pope, sir,
I got something to confess.

17:18.468 --> 17:21.703
This thing, hemorrhoid Jesus,
[chuckles] it's not real.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.137
[chuckles]

17:23.223 --> 17:24.888
- I know that.
- You do?

17:24.974 --> 17:27.308
- How?
- Because none of it's real.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.477
Religion's all a made-up fairy tale.

17:29.562 --> 17:32.447
Well, if it's all made up,
what's the point of the church?

17:32.482 --> 17:34.783
Money.
It's always been about money.

17:34.868 --> 17:36.034
<i>- # Money, money #
- # yeah #</i>

17:36.119 --> 17:37.285
<i>- # money, money #
- # uh-huh #</i>

17:37.370 --> 17:38.503
<i>- # money, money, huh #
- # what? #</i>

17:38.588 --> 17:40.038
<i>- # money, money, uh #
- # yeah #</i>

17:40.123 --> 17:41.372
<i>- # money, money, muh #
- # what? #</i>

17:41.458 --> 17:44.125
<i>- # money, money, huh, uh, huh #
- # get down #</i>

17:44.411 --> 17:46.327
And the Pope gets really angry

17:46.413 --> 17:49.080
when some punk bitch
steals what's his.

17:49.165 --> 17:51.833
- I'd never do that.
- Oh, you did do that.

17:51.885 --> 17:54.102
Catholics, mostly Mexicans,

17:54.170 --> 17:58.906
are flocking to see your hemorrhoid
instead of going to church,

17:58.975 --> 18:02.710
And less church
attendance is less money.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.846
And you know what happens to people

18:04.914 --> 18:07.415
who screw with the Pope's money?

18:07.484 --> 18:10.601
Slap on the wrist
with a flimsy ruler?

18:10.687 --> 18:11.736
They die.

18:11.821 --> 18:13.154
[screams]

18:13.189 --> 18:16.357
Could you sign this for my niece?
She's half Mexican.

18:18.862 --> 18:21.195
I guess I'll take these guys
down to the police station.

18:21.281 --> 18:25.116
Not so fast, Williams. I'll be
the one taking these lowlifes in.

18:25.201 --> 18:28.336
Taking down the Satan's BFFs
will impress the chief so much

18:28.371 --> 18:30.288
he'll make me top cop again.

18:30.373 --> 18:32.206
We'll tell the chief you
had nothing to do with it.

18:32.292 --> 18:35.376
No, you won't, because I'm
gonna put a bullet in all of you.

18:35.462 --> 18:37.128
I'll just say the bikers did it.

18:37.213 --> 18:40.515
Sorry I'm late. I...
Hey. Whose panties are these?

18:40.550 --> 18:42.750
[sniffs]
[gasps]

18:42.819 --> 18:43.685
Uh-oh!

18:44.504 --> 18:47.052
All right, time to waste these guys.

18:47.121 --> 18:48.387
[gun cocks]

18:48.456 --> 18:52.391
- Freeze! FBI!
- No, you freeze. DEA.

18:52.460 --> 18:59.202
- Everybody freeze. ATF.
- Damn, is anybody else here undercover?

18:59.633 --> 19:01.633
So was anybody here a real biker?

19:01.669 --> 19:04.002
[all disagreeing]

19:04.054 --> 19:06.555
So for the past ten years,
we've all been doing angel dust

19:06.640 --> 19:09.475
and murdering people,
trying not to blow our cover,

19:09.510 --> 19:11.844
and nobody here is a criminal?!

19:11.929 --> 19:14.680
Technically I guess he is.
He's kind of a dirty cop.

19:14.732 --> 19:15.931
[guns cocking]

19:16.016 --> 19:18.650
[gunfire]
[groans]

19:18.686 --> 19:20.602
Steve, be careful out there.

19:20.688 --> 19:23.071
You're lucky you weren't
dealing with real bikers.

19:23.157 --> 19:24.857
Yeah, real bikers
wouldn't have stopped

19:24.942 --> 19:27.159
at a handjob and a little sucking.

19:27.194 --> 19:29.611
Good advice.
What are you guys gonna do now?

19:29.697 --> 19:33.198
Well, I guess we can all
go back to our normal lives.

19:33.284 --> 19:36.635
<i>- Anyone know a good methadone clinic?
- Is Denzel okay?</i>

19:36.704 --> 19:39.004
[defibrillator whirring]

19:39.039 --> 19:41.340
What happened?
Where am I?

19:41.375 --> 19:42.674
Ooh, panties.

19:42.710 --> 19:43.709
[sniffs]

19:43.778 --> 19:45.244
