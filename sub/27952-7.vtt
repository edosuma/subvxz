00:06.631 --> 00:09.426
Dang, son! I'm killing
this budget spreadsheet.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.262
Being an adult is sad.

00:16.224 --> 00:17.100
I get that.

00:19.519 --> 00:22.063
I have returned.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.857
Dang. What happened to your nose?

00:23.940 --> 00:26.818
I went shoe-shopping with your mother.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.320
Yeah, that tracks.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.823
I'm just lucky Lydia came prepared.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.325
I told you I still need tampons.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.496
Abuelita, you got the shoes!

00:38.580 --> 00:40.498
You're my hero. Thank you.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.000
You're welcome.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.544
I really had to fight for them.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.795
Mami, we talked about this.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.631
-You cannot keep spoiling Alex.
-I'm not.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.593
I just went to pick them up for him
because he is still grounded.

00:51.676 --> 00:55.805
No, no. He paid with his own $300.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.851
Three hundred dollars
for one pair of shoes?

00:59.934 --> 01:02.479
They better come
with $280 stuffed in them!

01:10.028 --> 01:12.405
Mom, I did exactly what you told me to do.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.574
You said that if I wanted
to buy expensive shoes,

01:14.657 --> 01:16.201
I had to earn my own money.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.203
I did say that.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.748
Lesson number two.
Don't buy stupid stuff. Come here.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.879
Look at my credit card statement.
Every dollar is budgeted.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.381
Four hundred dollars a month
for groceries,

01:30.465 --> 01:32.425
sixty dollars to keep the lights on,

01:32.509 --> 01:34.844
seven dollars at the Fountain Hotel.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.012
What?

01:36.721 --> 01:38.431
That's not my charge.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.266
Somebody must've stolen
my credit card number.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.143
For seven dollars?

01:42.227 --> 01:44.145
Not how I would have played it.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.648
No, no, no. This is what they do.

01:46.731 --> 01:50.401
They start by racking up little charges
to make sure the card works.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.113
Macy's, Nike, Harley-Davidson.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.490
Then you realize
they're living your best life.

01:57.826 --> 01:58.993
Did you cancel the card?

01:59.077 --> 02:01.329
No, I wanted to see
what I would have done next.

02:03.873 --> 02:07.085
Listen, I have never even
been to your hotel.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.462
It's a minibar charge?
You really got the wrong girl.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.509
What are you gonna accuse me of next?
Not washing and reusing tinfoil?

02:16.803 --> 02:18.638
What was the name on the credit card?

02:19.347 --> 02:21.724
Elena Alvarez? Wait!

02:26.354 --> 02:27.230
[Penelope] Thank you.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.899
Hi!

02:32.777 --> 02:35.738
Why did you use your emergency
credit card at the Fountain Hotel?

02:35.822 --> 02:37.282
And what were you even doing there?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.700
A few people had died there.

02:38.783 --> 02:39.993
I was ghost hunting.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.330
-No, you weren't.
-No, I wasn't.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.876
Elena, come on. Be honest.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.883
[clears throat]
Syd and I got a hotel room.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.177
Why would you need...

03:10.857 --> 03:11.733
Uh...

03:21.659 --> 03:23.578
I can't believe you used the minibar.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.127
And you know, you...

03:31.878 --> 03:34.839
We're going to circle back
around to all of this.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.343
Mami, where are you going?

03:38.927 --> 03:40.303
I'm not quite sure.

What's wrong with Elena?

04:40.947 --> 04:41.781
What?

04:41.864 --> 04:44.909
Nothing. I just wanted
to hang outside of group.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.035
It's been a while since--

04:46.119 --> 04:48.746
The last time you wanted to know
lesbian stuff about Elena.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.332
That's the only reason you call.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.709
Come on, girl. That's not true.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.254
It's fine. What do you want to talk about?

04:57.839 --> 05:00.091
What's up with the bees?
Are they coming back or what?

05:01.801 --> 05:03.553
[chuckles]

05:03.636 --> 05:07.640
Just ask me a question about Elena.
It's fine.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.767
I kind of like being your lesbian Yoda.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.396
I think she's having sex.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.025
[in a robotic voice]
I will need another drink.

05:19.736 --> 05:20.737
I don't know Yoda.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.490
[Schneider clears throat]

05:24.574 --> 05:27.702
So your mom has asked me
to give you a little chat

05:27.785 --> 05:29.996
about irresponsible spending.

05:30.079 --> 05:33.291
Yeah. She said to show me all
the stupid stuff you wasted money on

05:33.374 --> 05:34.834
so that I don't end up like you.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.671
It's a program she calls "Scared Smart".

05:41.299 --> 05:44.886
Yeah, she's really starting to lean on me
as a co-parent.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.597
[Schneider] Take a gander.

05:48.514 --> 05:52.226
Really old comic books,
unopened Star Wars toys,

05:52.310 --> 05:54.520
Shirley Temple's tap shoes.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.064
Why did I think they'd fit?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.233
Who would want all this crap?

06:00.276 --> 06:02.570
Schneider, all this stuff is really cool.

06:03.738 --> 06:04.697
Is it?

06:05.823 --> 06:08.159
Or is it just a symbol of a young man

06:08.242 --> 06:11.037
who tried to use money
to fill the hole in his soul?

06:11.704 --> 06:13.331
It didn't work.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.250
Yeah, but now all of this stuff
is worth tons of money.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.877
Is it? Wait. Is it?

06:22.673 --> 06:25.510
You own the Ghostbusters car?

06:29.138 --> 06:30.056
Yes, I do.

06:31.015 --> 06:32.016
Here's a lesson:

06:32.642 --> 06:35.103
I heard that car was
suddenly going up for auction,

06:35.186 --> 06:38.606
so I had to ditch dinner plans
with my favorite Uncle Gary.

06:38.689 --> 06:41.025
He'd just had a triple bypass.

06:41.109 --> 06:42.860
-Wow.
-Yeah.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.904
He died while I was at that auction.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.991
Turns out, he needed a quadruple bypass.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.329
I will always regret that day.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.624
'Cause you were so selfish, you forgot
family is more important than anything.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.502
No. 'Cause I should have waited
and bid on the Back to the Future car.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.587
That thing travels back in time.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.881
I could've gone back
and not bid on the Ghostbusters car.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.179
Or told Gary to have that fourth bypass,
but whatever, your thing works, too.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.143
See, I know what I would say to Elena
if she were straight.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.937
Use a condom. Take the pill.
Don't have sex.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.648
Well, when you're a lesbian,
it's even simpler.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.733
You don't need a condom,
you don't need the pill,

07:22.817 --> 07:24.777
and the best part, four boobs.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.115
Okay.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.701
I get it. It's great.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.954
But what about STDs?

07:35.037 --> 07:38.166
Safe lesbian sex
is not my area of expertise.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.417
I mean, what do you use?

07:40.001 --> 07:42.587
A dish glove? A swim cap? A thimble?

07:45.631 --> 07:47.508
Do you even have a vagina?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.846
There's hardly any risk physically.
She's gonna be fine.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.640
So what? I'm supposed to be okay
that she's having sex?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.143
I'm a mom. She's my kid.
I can't condone this. No, Ramona.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.605
When did I become the bad guy?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.648
I'm just trying to make you less worried,

08:02.732 --> 08:05.943
and I can assume it's with Syd,
who she's been dating forever?

08:07.695 --> 08:08.905
[exhales deeply]

08:08.988 --> 08:11.616
Elena's 17. She is just way too young.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.075
And how old were you?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.036
Seventeen and a half.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.123
And what did your mom say?

08:19.207 --> 08:21.626
[scoffs]
Are you kidding me?

08:21.709 --> 08:22.877
She doesn't know.

08:27.548 --> 08:28.841
I was sneaky.

08:28.925 --> 08:31.761
I didn't put her through the torture
of thinking about this.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.222
As far as she knows,
I had sex once to make Elena.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.933
And how does she think Alex got here?

08:37.016 --> 08:39.018
She tells people she had him.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.690
If you're gonna be
a sexually active teenager,

08:44.774 --> 08:46.108
you need to do it responsibly

08:46.192 --> 08:47.944
and make sure
your parents never find out.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.322
But now I know,
and I have to have an opinion.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.660
And I don't want to be the mom that's all,
"Sex is dirty. You're gonna go to hell."

08:55.743 --> 08:57.703
But I also don't want to be
the mom that's like,

08:57.787 --> 09:00.331
"Use my bed. I'll get you water,
so you stay hydrated."

09:05.336 --> 09:06.629
Now I have to talk to her.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.173
[cries] I don't want to.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.512
Oh, Papito, how are the shoes?

09:14.595 --> 09:16.138
Great. I sold them.

09:16.847 --> 09:20.476
[dish clangs]

09:20.560 --> 09:22.812
I know, I know, but...

09:23.354 --> 09:26.107
they were already worth twice as much
as what I paid for them.

09:26.190 --> 09:28.484
How could you do such a thing?

09:28.901 --> 09:30.987
I stood in line for hours!

09:31.070 --> 09:33.447
I know, and Dr. Berkowitz
got a busted nose.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.616
Oh, please. That's just a scratch.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.497
Abuelita, I really appreciate
what you did.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.456
Mm-hmm.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.335
So I'm going to use some money
to take you out to dinner.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.882
Aww, Papito.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.345
You do a lot for me,
and it's time I paid you back a little.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.472
And unlike Mami,

09:58.556 --> 10:01.350
I'm gonna let you get an appetizer
and a beverage.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.811
[laughs]

10:05.229 --> 10:07.189
I know that's how they get you.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.191
But they're gonna get us.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.903
You are such a good son... Grandson.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.202
Listen, Mami...

10:20.286 --> 10:21.954
Okay, look, you know why I'm here.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.581
We got to do this.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.833
I don't want to do it either,
but here goes.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.628
I'm your mom.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.714
My first instinct is to protect you.

10:32.506 --> 10:33.591
I mean, if I had it my way,

10:33.674 --> 10:37.219
I'd keep you hidden away from the world
in my mouth like a freaking pelican.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.181
Actually, Finding Nemo
is really misleading. Pelicans--

10:40.264 --> 10:42.600
Okay, I'm halfway through
a very prepared speech.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.943
Even though I sometimes wish
it weren't happening, you're growing up.

11:01.035 --> 11:04.080
The first time I had sex, I was 17.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.791
I thought I was ready,

11:07.541 --> 11:09.585
but I kind of had a freak out after.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.003
It's a roller coaster.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.255
One day, you're fine.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.508
Next day, you have sex.

11:15.925 --> 11:19.553
The day after that, the boy you lost
your virginity to doesn't call you back,

11:19.637 --> 11:22.098
and you're filling the glove compartment
of his Camaro with tuna

11:22.181 --> 11:23.808
so he knows he messed with the wrong girl.

11:25.976 --> 11:28.229
Then you're called "Tunelope"
for the rest of high school.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.397
Worth it? Yes.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.609
Okay, you lost me.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.989
[sighs]
What I mean is that it's very emotional.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.369
And also, check your answering machine

11:43.452 --> 11:46.372
'cause maybe he called you while you were
loading up on Dollar Store tuna.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.338
The point I'm trying to make is that...

11:55.548 --> 11:57.258
sex is not a dirty thing...

11:57.842 --> 11:58.843
that you should hide.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.431
But it's also not something
that you should take lightly.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.895
And I just want to make sure
that you're okay

12:09.979 --> 12:11.647
with what did or didn't happen.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.193
So, are you okay?

12:19.363 --> 12:20.239
Well...

12:27.037 --> 12:27.997
Hey, guys.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.709
Mom, that was a really gendered greeting.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.338
Don't try to distract me from the fact

12:36.422 --> 12:38.632
that this door was closed
when you know it should be open.

12:38.716 --> 12:39.884
Okay, I'm sorry.

12:39.967 --> 12:43.512
Okay, I'm sorry too
about the gendered greeting. Later, dudes.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.889
Oh, caught that one.

12:46.807 --> 12:47.933
Can we go to your house?

12:48.476 --> 12:52.730
I'm homeschooled, and my parents are
holding football tryouts for my brother.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.863
We never get to be alone.

13:01.447 --> 13:05.367
And I love just
making out with you, but...

13:05.451 --> 13:07.203
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

13:07.620 --> 13:12.333
Because I think I'm ready for more...
if you're ready.

13:12.416 --> 13:15.294
I'm definitely ready to do more
than fumble with your bra

13:15.377 --> 13:17.379
whenever your mom isn't checking on us.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.343
Which is only when she's in the bathroom.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.346
Remember when she got food poisoning?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.807
That was so hot.

13:31.185 --> 13:33.270
Okay, so what do we do?

13:33.729 --> 13:34.855
Where can we be alone?

13:36.023 --> 13:38.150
What do they do in teen movies?

13:38.234 --> 13:41.779
I feel like a lot of stuff happens
in parked cars.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.908
Damn. I need to learn how to drive
so we can park.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.162
[Alex clears throat]

13:51.330 --> 13:52.289
Alex, what're you doing?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.917
Mom's in the bathroom,
so she's making me stand here.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.838
Can I ask a favor...

13:58.921 --> 14:01.674
since I spend the afternoon
chaperoning two horny nerds?

14:03.425 --> 14:04.635
Sure, honey, anything.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.929
Can I have tomorrow off
from being grounded?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.848
Aww. No.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.601
You screwed up,
and now you are my prisoner.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.689
Psst! Papito.

14:23.445 --> 14:27.283
Do you, uh, need something
from the outside?

14:33.455 --> 14:35.332
The new Yeezys drop tomorrow.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.126
Jesus is coming back tomorrow?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.881
I just spoke to him.
He didn't tell me anything.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.014
Yeezys are sneakers.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.682
I've been saving up for months now,

14:51.765 --> 14:53.934
and if I'm not in line
at the store tomorrow,

14:54.018 --> 14:54.935
they'll all be gone.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.980
Consider it done.

14:58.063 --> 15:02.276
I will get you those shoes
even if I have to cut off somebody's feet.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.239
You just have to stand in line.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.200
Oh, fine. Suck the fun out of it.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.995
Which reminds me.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.413
I will invite Leslie.

15:16.749 --> 15:17.583
Really?

15:17.666 --> 15:20.419
Okay. Thanks. Now, let me tell you
which sneakers to get.

15:20.502 --> 15:24.757
No need. I will just get the ones
that go best with your church pants.

15:26.133 --> 15:27.009
What? No.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.844
Okay. Then I'll get whatever's on sale.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.262
That's worse.

15:32.723 --> 15:37.061
Abuelita, we need to find a way
for you to get me...

15:37.770 --> 15:38.938
exactly what I want.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.195
Is it working? Can you see
what the phone is pointing at?

15:46.278 --> 15:48.697
Yes! Now please turn it around.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.373
[Elena clears throat]

15:58.707 --> 15:59.625
Hey there.

16:00.668 --> 16:03.128
We would like to rent a room.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.339
You know, like we've done a million times.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.051
Ugh, so sick of it.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.595
That's the life we chose
as traveling astronauts.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.184
That... is the name of our band.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.103
Good save.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.189
I'll just need a credit card.

16:22.898 --> 16:27.569
Well, uh, sir, we were hoping
that we could pay for this room in cash.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.614
Cash from all our music gigs.

16:30.698 --> 16:34.243
Not playing for money in a competitive
Magic: The Gathering League.

16:35.452 --> 16:37.788
We still need a credit card on file
for incidentals.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.208
-Do you have a credit card?
-No.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.377
-Do you have one?
-Kind of.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.589
My mom gave me one, but it's supposed
to be for emergencies only.

16:48.215 --> 16:51.552
I mean, it is kind of an emergency.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.678
[giggles]

16:52.761 --> 16:54.513
Yeah, she's not gonna see it that way.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.017
Not that I was totally listening,

16:58.100 --> 17:01.478
but heads-up on that credit card.
It's just a precaution.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.563
It won't be charged.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.689
Are you sure?

17:03.772 --> 17:05.065
Yeah.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.276
Just don't touch the minibar
or steal a robe.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.569
[Elena chuckles]

17:08.652 --> 17:10.988
And no trash in the room, rockstars.

17:11.822 --> 17:15.367
Aww! That sucks, square.

17:18.495 --> 17:19.538
Sorry.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.503
Ugh! Musicians.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.760
Oh! It's our turn finally.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.845
Nice. Remember, just repeat after me.

17:35.512 --> 17:36.722
Hi. How can I help you?

17:38.515 --> 17:40.434
Hey, bro, how are you living?

17:42.853 --> 17:44.772
Hook me up with what is good.

17:45.397 --> 17:46.356
What do you want?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.776
-Okay, I want--
-Alex, what are you doing?

17:48.859 --> 17:49.693
Nothing?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.654
I want nothing.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.324
All right. Next.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.409
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no, no, no.

18:00.245 --> 18:01.288
You're grounded,

18:01.371 --> 18:04.374
which, you know, means you're not supposed
to be on your phone on the weekends.

18:07.461 --> 18:09.379
Hello. Hello, Alex? Hello?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.298
Oh, no.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.801
Papito has been compromised.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.347
Okay. We are on our own.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.934
We want the Jesus shoes.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.813
-Yeezys.
-Yeah.

18:25.896 --> 18:27.981
These are the two pairs that just dropped.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.609
Thank you for picking them up.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.947
How do we know which ones he wants?

18:35.030 --> 18:37.282
Well, the yellow ones are pretty sharp.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.910
Right. We'll take
the blue one, size eight.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.747
That guy just bought the last four pairs.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.042
[sighs]

18:56.051 --> 19:00.180
Hola. I speak Spanish
because I grew up in Cuba.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.016
As a child, I had to flee.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.102
I escape with absolutely--

19:05.185 --> 19:07.187
You're not getting my shoes.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.690
No, wait. Listen.

19:10.941 --> 19:15.904
I am going to tell you something
I have never told anybody before.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.990
You would probably not believe it.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.950
I am old.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.912
Oh, Lydia, your soul isn't a day over 25.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.998
Can it, Leslie!

19:26.707 --> 19:30.752
Look, I have $300.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.590
Oh, please. This is for my grandson.

19:34.673 --> 19:37.968
He is the most important person
in the world to me.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.180
You know, I know
I might not be around forever,

19:41.889 --> 19:44.683
but these shoes will be.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.104
Maybe it's silly to you, but...

19:49.855 --> 19:53.817
I just want him to have something
to always remember me by.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.696
Wow, I get that.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.116
I guess he can remember you
as the grandmother who...

20:01.200 --> 20:02.659
didn't get him these bitching kicks.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.162
[chatter in disagreement]

20:05.245 --> 20:08.624
You have four pairs.
Give her the shoes.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.000
Yeah, give her the shoes, man!

20:10.083 --> 20:11.668
This is going viral.

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
Don't be that guy.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.299
You know how long
she must have had to save up for those?

20:17.382 --> 20:20.594
Yeah, man, don't be a racist.
Give the maid the shoes.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.263
[chatter]

20:23.347 --> 20:24.890
[girl] Come on!

20:24.973 --> 20:26.808
-Fine!
-You got plenty of them.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.060
[Lydia gasps]

20:28.685 --> 20:30.187
Thank you.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.355
Thank you.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.564
[Lydia laughs]

20:32.648 --> 20:34.566
Lydia, you did it!

20:34.650 --> 20:36.026
Pa'lante!

20:36.735 --> 20:37.903
[Leslie groans]

20:37.986 --> 20:39.988
[laughs]

20:40.781 --> 20:43.825
And... let's begin.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.371
That was weird.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.122
Yep.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.916
I just feel like, in the movies,

20:50.999 --> 20:53.627
they usually skip to like
the end of this. Right?

20:53.710 --> 20:57.589
Boom! One of us has the sheet here,
the other has it down here.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.632
[Elena chuckles]

20:58.715 --> 20:59.716
Oh, wait.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.885
I wanted to set the mood,

21:01.969 --> 21:05.764
so I made a playlist of the sexiest songs.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.183
["The X-Files" theme plays]

21:09.726 --> 21:11.395
X-Files.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.690
Wait.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.150
[music stops]

21:17.818 --> 21:20.862
So, I just want you to know...

21:21.738 --> 21:24.199
how incredible I think you are.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.870
I am so happy that you're the first person
I'm doing this with.

21:29.913 --> 21:34.835
And I think that you are the most
beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life,

21:35.419 --> 21:38.797
and I can't believe your heart
is even more beautiful.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.340
Oh!

21:40.424 --> 21:41.800
We already paid for the room.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.093
You're gonna get some.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.637
All right.

21:45.721 --> 21:48.515
We talked the talk,
now we got to walk the walk.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.935
Do you consent to engage
in sexual activity with me?

21:52.019 --> 21:54.313
An enthusiastic "yes"!

21:54.980 --> 21:56.898
-Do you?
-Oh, hell yes!

21:57.941 --> 21:59.651
As agreed, our safe word is...

21:59.735 --> 22:01.737
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.239
Hey, did you bring a condom?

22:04.323 --> 22:07.159
Uh, yeah. I've had one in my wallet
since, like, eighth grade.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.410
[Elena laughs]

22:08.493 --> 22:10.495
When was the last time you got tested?

22:11.538 --> 22:14.374
Last year when I was with Selene.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.463
Wait, are you serious?

22:22.132 --> 22:23.592
You've had sex before.

22:25.135 --> 22:25.969
Yeah.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.807
Wow.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.809
I'm sorry.

22:32.893 --> 22:36.229
I didn't tell you because I didn't even
want to talk to you about it

22:36.313 --> 22:38.023
until I was sure you were ready.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.734
I didn't want to put any pressure on it.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.449
I just thought this was gonna be
both of our first times.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.078
Well...

22:51.828 --> 22:53.455
I wasn't in love then,

22:54.331 --> 22:55.665
but I am now.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.002
So in a way, this is my first time, too.

23:01.254 --> 23:03.048
I also...

23:03.131 --> 23:06.468
wanted you to think that I was
awesome at it right out the gate.

23:07.761 --> 23:08.595
But...

23:09.054 --> 23:12.891
mostly, I wanted to make sure
this happened on your terms.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.184
This is a big deal.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.771
Mm-hmm.

23:18.939 --> 23:19.815
It is a big deal!

23:22.109 --> 23:24.778
What if I think I'm ready
and I'm not really ready?

23:24.861 --> 23:27.614
How am I going to know
because five minutes ago, I was all like,

23:27.697 --> 23:29.199
"Yeah, let's do this,"

23:29.282 --> 23:32.869
and now we're in a random hotel room
about to do it.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.497
How did I not think
about any of this before?

23:35.580 --> 23:36.456
Are you okay?

23:36.540 --> 23:40.252
You're gonna see me naked.
Like, full naked.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.628
You think this is white.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.505
This has never seen the sun.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.094
But then again,

23:50.303 --> 23:54.599
virginity is just a construct
used to uphold the patriarchy,

23:54.683 --> 23:56.476
and I can't even get pregnant.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.978
So who cares?

23:59.229 --> 24:01.523
Okay, but now
that I really think about it...

24:05.235 --> 24:06.361
I don't know.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.491
I'm scared. What if...

24:12.117 --> 24:14.578
this changes everything,
and not in a good way?

24:20.667 --> 24:23.003
Elena, there's no rush.

24:23.086 --> 24:27.007
We can do it next month, next year.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.759
We can never do it
if that's what you want.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.596
No matter what happens,

24:33.138 --> 24:34.347
I love you.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.268
I love you, too.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.354
Let's just watch a movie.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.940
There's a Harry Potter marathon on,

24:44.024 --> 24:46.818
and I brought Every Flavour Beans
in case this happened.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.996
Did you hear something fall?

24:59.122 --> 25:00.165
-No.
-Okay.

25:06.546 --> 25:07.964
So, are you okay?

25:09.633 --> 25:10.550
Well...

25:13.345 --> 25:14.221
yeah.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.097
I am.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.016
Good.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.018
Are you okay?

25:22.145 --> 25:23.396
Well...

25:24.856 --> 25:27.442
I was really wishing you were better
at sneaking around like I was,

25:27.526 --> 25:29.528
so I wouldn't have to know
anything about this.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.990
But now that I do, I am glad
that we're talking like this.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.245
And I'm glad you had a good experience.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.164
And that it happened
with someone you love.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.501
But I'm still your mom,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.504
and the rules of this house stay the same.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.631
That door stays open.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.591
Okay, Mami.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.428
