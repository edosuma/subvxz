03:33.797 --> 03:35.757

03:35.799 --> 03:36.967

07:31.868 --> 07:33.661
Sweetheart, do you want

07:31.868 --> 07:33.661
a glass of water?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.330
No, thank you.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.124
- Are you sure?

07:35.372 --> 07:37.124
- Yes.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.166

when you get

07:38.208 --> 07:39.793
a little nervous.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.045
Oh, that's right.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.045
I'm so predictable, right?

Okay, let's bring back

09:14.095 --> 09:16.431
the guys.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.849
Guys.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.017
While you were gone

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
we asked the gals

09:19.059 --> 09:20.894
some questions

09:20.935 --> 09:24.772
to find out just how much

09:20.935 --> 09:24.772
they know about you.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.150
What could she

09:24.814 --> 09:27.150
possibly know about me?

09:28.485 --> 09:30.529
I know you're a whiner.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.077
Okay, let's start

09:34.115 --> 09:37.077
with our dating couple.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.745
Steve, we asked D.J.--

09:38.786 --> 09:39.954
Why bother?

09:39.996 --> 09:41.164
I thought we knew each other

09:41.206 --> 09:42.790
but we're like

09:41.206 --> 09:42.790
complete strangers.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.543
What?

09:42.832 --> 09:44.543
How can you say that?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.294
You know, D.J., this is starting

09:44.584 --> 09:46.294
to get on my nerves.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.046
- I'm starting get on your..

09:46.336 --> 09:48.046
- I'm very serious.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.423
Hey, come on, you two

09:48.088 --> 09:49.423
don't fight.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.258
You're such a sweet couple.

Stone, bring those rented

09:52.675 --> 09:55.720

09:57.222 --> 09:59.807
Listen, I never wanna

09:57.222 --> 09:59.807
hear the expression

09:59.849 --> 10:01.435
"Sweet couple" again.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.810
Now, the idea of this game

10:02.852 --> 10:04.271
is to embarrass people

10:04.312 --> 10:05.980
get them to butt heads.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.566
[chuckles]

10:10.110 --> 10:13.405
Okay, let's get back

10:10.110 --> 10:13.405
to D.J. and Steve

10:13.447 --> 10:16.283
who were about to rip

10:13.447 --> 10:16.283
each other's heads off.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.077
Can we just get back

10:17.367 --> 10:19.077
to the game?

10:20.454 --> 10:21.955
Steve..

10:21.996 --> 10:24.374
We asked D.J. what fish

10:24.416 --> 10:26.334
you think she kisses like.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.710
Uh, the fish?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.880
I don't know.

10:28.836 --> 10:30.880
What, the flounder?

10:31.590 --> 10:33.425
Flounder?

10:33.467 --> 10:36.886
Ouch. That is one big,

10:33.467 --> 10:36.886
ugly bottom feeder.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.807
Let's see

10:39.013 --> 10:40.807
what D.J. said.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.186
Well, I hope

10:42.934 --> 10:45.186
Steve would say

10:45.228 --> 10:46.771
I kiss like an Angelfish.

10:47.730 --> 10:48.856
Oh.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.359
Tropical fish are allowed?

10:51.401 --> 10:53.403
Well, then obviously

10:51.401 --> 10:53.403
it's Angelfish. Come on..

10:53.445 --> 10:54.946
I can't believe

10:53.445 --> 10:54.946
you said Flounder.

10:54.988 --> 10:58.741
Whoa, looks like this

10:54.988 --> 10:58.741
relationship is floundering.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.997
Okay, let's go back

11:04.038 --> 11:05.373
to Mr. Ball

11:05.415 --> 11:07.542
and Mrs. Chain

11:08.543 --> 11:10.795
Jesse and Rebecc-ah.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.215
Okay.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.135
Jesse, we asked Rebecc-ah

11:17.177 --> 11:20.805
what would you say

11:17.177 --> 11:20.805
is your obsession.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.974
Well, she thinks she

11:20.847 --> 11:22.974
knows me so well

11:23.016 --> 11:25.810
so she's probably gonna say

11:23.016 --> 11:25.810
my obsession's my hair

11:25.852 --> 11:27.812
but I'm gonna throw

11:25.852 --> 11:27.812
a little curve ball here.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.105
'Cause I have a brand

11:27.854 --> 11:29.105
new obsession.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.649
And my obsession

11:29.147 --> 11:30.649
is proving to her

11:30.689 --> 11:32.651
that I'm totally

11:30.689 --> 11:32.651
unpredictable.

11:32.691 --> 11:33.943
Match that.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.820
Okay, let's see

11:33.985 --> 11:35.820
what Rebecca said.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.158
He's definitely

11:37.864 --> 11:40.158
preoccupied with his hair.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.993
Ha-ha.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.993
I knew it.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.703
But, lately,

11:42.035 --> 11:44.703
he's been trying so hard

11:44.745 --> 11:46.206
to be unpredictable.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.416
He's actually become

11:46.247 --> 11:48.416
obsessed with that.

Okay, let's move on

11:56.174 --> 11:57.967
to our engaged couple.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.761
We are not engaged.

12:02.681 --> 12:06.518
Danny, what song

12:02.681 --> 12:06.518
did Estelle say

12:06.560 --> 12:09.354
you'd most like

12:06.560 --> 12:09.354
to hear at your wedding?

12:09.396 --> 12:11.730
Only Vicky knows our song.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.609
and it's, uh, it's

12:11.772 --> 12:14.609
"Love Will Keep Us Together."

12:14.651 --> 12:17.529
Well, let's hear

12:14.651 --> 12:17.529
what Estelle had to say.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.950
Well, he's kind of

12:19.822 --> 12:22.950
high-strung but sensitive

12:22.992 --> 12:25.744
like Bernie,

12:22.992 --> 12:25.744
my third husband.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.746

teasing Jesse about

15:16.040 --> 15:17.542
being predictable

but I see that

15:17.584 --> 15:19.919
it's really bothering him

15:45.862 --> 15:47.113
I'll tell you what's wrong.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.615
How would you like it

15:47.154 --> 15:48.615
if someone knew

15:48.656 --> 15:50.157
your every thought,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.157
you know

15:50.199 --> 15:51.284
your-your every need

15:51.325 --> 15:53.703
your...your every desire?

15:53.745 --> 15:55.413
Actually, it doesn't

15:53.745 --> 15:55.413
sound that bad.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.415
Sweetheart, don't you see?

15:57.457 --> 15:58.750
The reason

15:57.457 --> 15:58.750
I know you so well

15:58.792 --> 16:00.501
is because I love you

15:58.792 --> 16:00.501
so much.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.670
Oh, I know.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.670
I'm sorry.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.923
I've been acting silly.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.883
You know, my whole life

16:04.964 --> 16:06.883
I wanted someone

16:06.925 --> 16:08.134
that-that knew me this well.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.136
That knew me this

16:08.175 --> 16:10.136
intimately and I got it.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.889
I'm-I'm a very lucky guy.

16:12.931 --> 16:16.476
Uh, Rebecca, you gonna let him

16:12.931 --> 16:16.476
talk to you that way?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.937
- Butt out, Stone.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.937
- Yeah, Stone.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.235
Did you know I was

16:24.358 --> 16:26.235
gonna do that?

16:26.778 --> 16:27.862
Huh?

16:30.740 --> 16:32.909
Sweetheart,

16:30.740 --> 16:32.909
where are we going?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.829
Like you don't know.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.037
You two, where do you think

16:35.870 --> 16:37.037
you're going?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.915
You can't leave.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.915
Come on. Hey.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.918
[chuckles]

16:40.082 --> 16:41.918
Well..

16:43.127 --> 16:44.712
I guess they're going

16:43.127 --> 16:44.712
to duke it out

16:44.754 --> 16:46.965
in the parking lot.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.884
Okay, let's get back

16:47.006 --> 16:49.884
to D.J. and Steve.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.135
Let's face it.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.261
We're never gonna

16:51.177 --> 16:52.261

16:52.303 --> 16:54.430

16:58.768 --> 17:00.102
everything new

16:58.768 --> 17:00.102
I learn about you

17:00.144 --> 17:01.562
is like another surprise.

17:01.604 --> 17:05.065
You know, it's like

17:01.604 --> 17:05.065
unwrapping a new present.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.694
You know, makes every day

17:05.107 --> 17:07.694
feel like Christmas.

17:07.735 --> 17:10.989
Well, Steve is laying it

17:07.735 --> 17:10.989
on pretty darn thick right now.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.365
He's in trouble, folks.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.660
He's not in trouble.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.496
That was really beautiful.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.751

17:29.048 --> 17:30.341

17:30.383 --> 17:32.844

17:30.383 --> 17:32.844

17:32.886 --> 17:35.555

17:43.396 --> 17:48.026
in Cabo, San Lucas.

17:51.362 --> 17:52.989
Well, folks,

17:51.362 --> 17:52.989
that's our show.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.949
I'm Joe Stone saying

17:54.991 --> 17:58.285
may all your couplings

17:54.991 --> 17:58.285
be perfect.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.455
Good show, everybody.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.042
You're not bad, Stone.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.168
If you're that vicious

18:04.083 --> 18:06.168
with your family

18:06.210 --> 18:09.422

18:06.210 --> 18:09.422
with strangers.

18:09.463 --> 18:10.840
Well, I am thinking about it.

18:10.882 --> 18:12.341
And I can't spend

18:10.882 --> 18:12.341
the rest of my life

18:12.383 --> 18:13.968
humiliating people.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.678

Hey, pal,

18:18.180 --> 18:20.266

18:25.688 --> 18:27.565

18:29.567 --> 18:31.611
Estelle and I

18:29.567 --> 18:31.611

18:31.652 --> 18:33.320
We'll send

18:31.652 --> 18:33.320
you a post card.

Who is that?

18:37.283 --> 18:39.285
One half of

18:37.283 --> 18:39.285
the perfect couple.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.494
Vicky, where were you?

18:40.536 --> 18:42.204
I know you're angry

18:40.536 --> 18:42.204
but when you hear

18:42.246 --> 18:45.041
where I was

18:42.246 --> 18:45.041
you're gonna be happy.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.711
I was in a meeting

18:45.083 --> 18:48.711
with the head of the network.

18:48.753 --> 18:52.298
Danny, I'm gonna anchor

18:48.753 --> 18:52.298
the network news

18:52.339 --> 18:53.591
in New York.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.011
New York?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.429
New York?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.473
You can't catch a cab

18:58.471 --> 19:00.473
in the rain, New York?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.266
Yes, yes, and I don't

19:00.514 --> 19:02.266
need a cab

19:02.308 --> 19:03.559
'cause I got a driver.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.568
- What's gonna happen to us?

19:09.440 --> 19:12.568
- Well, nothing, nothing.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.654
I'll just be based in New York

19:12.610 --> 19:14.654
instead of Chicago.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.614
I mean, things will be

19:14.695 --> 19:16.614
exactly the same between us.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.825
I don't want things

19:16.656 --> 19:18.825
exactly the same between us.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.745
I want things to get-get

19:18.866 --> 19:22.745
better and-and closer

19:22.787 --> 19:25.205
not farther and worser.

19:26.958 --> 19:29.877
Vicky, I-I wanted

19:26.958 --> 19:29.877
to sit down with you

19:29.919 --> 19:32.588
this weekend and finally set

19:29.919 --> 19:32.588
our wedding date.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.427
When are we gonna

19:35.925 --> 19:38.427
start our life together?

19:41.973 --> 19:44.266
Well, this does

19:41.973 --> 19:44.266
complicate things.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.228
I guess we'll just have

19:46.226 --> 19:48.228
to wait a little longer.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.944
I, uh, I can't do that.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.032
It hurts too much

19:56.863 --> 19:59.032
being apart all the time.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.785
I know.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.785
It hurts me, too.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.662
But I just don't see

20:02.827 --> 20:04.662
any other way for us.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.413
I mean, unless you move

20:04.704 --> 20:06.413
to New York.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.209
You know I can't do that.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.420
I mean, I can't-I can't

20:10.250 --> 20:13.420
uproot my family.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.256
If it was just me,

20:13.462 --> 20:16.256
I'd be there in a second.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.342
But everything in the world

20:16.298 --> 20:18.342
that's important to me

20:18.384 --> 20:19.844
is right here

20:18.384 --> 20:19.844
in San Francisco.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.224
Except you.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.477
Oh, Danny, you're

20:25.265 --> 20:28.477
very important to me, too.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.232
But I-I can't

20:30.229 --> 20:33.232
turn down this job.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.068
I mean, I've always wanted

20:33.273 --> 20:35.068
to be a network anchor.

20:35.109 --> 20:36.318
I mean, when I was

20:35.109 --> 20:36.318

20:36.360 --> 20:38.196
with a Barbara Walters doll.

20:46.704 --> 20:51.000
to give up your dream.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.921
So I guess I'm gonna

20:52.668 --> 20:54.921
have to give up mine.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.135
Are you saying

20:58.883 --> 21:01.135
that it's over?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.390
Yeah, I guess I am.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.770
I do love you.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.189
I love you, too.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.652
I guess that's

21:16.275 --> 21:18.652
not enough, is it?

21:19.862 --> 21:21.614
I guess not.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.310

21:53.646 --> 21:56.607

21:53.646 --> 21:56.607

21:56.649 --> 21:59.359

22:02.655 --> 22:04.198

22:04.240 --> 22:07.868
But, uh, I don't have

22:04.240 --> 22:07.868
much of an appetite right now.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.651
pretty great the way we are.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.823
Yeah. At least

22:42.903 --> 22:45.823
we got each other.
