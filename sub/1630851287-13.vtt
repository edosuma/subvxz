JUDY:
Good morning,

00:17.426 --> 00:19.910
my aurora
imaginary-best-friend-ealis.

00:19.928 --> 00:22.021
So, you know how I've been doing
some investigative journalism

00:22.172 --> 00:25.024
for the school newspaper
about the Saved by the Spells?

00:25.175 --> 00:26.525
They were a school
secret society or something?

00:26.676 --> 00:30.254
Uh, they were a school
secret society or everything.

00:30.347 --> 00:32.514
25 years ago,
a group of students

00:32.533 --> 00:34.274
calling themselves
the Saved by the Spells

00:34.368 --> 00:37.685
pulled off the most legendary
prank in school history when,

00:37.705 --> 00:40.372
in the cover of darkness,
they mowed

00:40.599 --> 00:43.208
Keanu Reeves's face
into the soccer field.

00:43.435 --> 00:44.859
People could recognize
Keanu's face

00:44.953 --> 00:46.453
from the grass
on a soccer field?

00:46.605 --> 00:49.289
Uh, no, but they left behind
a note saying,

00:49.383 --> 00:52.367
"We mowed Keanu Reeves's face
into the soccer field,"

00:52.444 --> 00:54.369
and then everyone was like,
"Oh, wow."

00:54.463 --> 00:55.462
So, yesterday,

00:55.556 --> 00:57.281
<i> someone emailed me</i>
<i> an anonymous tip</i>

00:57.299 --> 00:59.058
<i> to search the school's</i>
<i> decommissioned practice mine,</i>

00:59.285 --> 01:02.210
<i>where, for years, all Lone Moose</i>
<i> children were prepared</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:03.970
<i> for an inevitable</i>
<i> life of work underground.</i>

01:04.065 --> 01:06.047
<i> There, I found this.</i>

01:06.067 --> 01:07.399
It's basically
an instruction manual

01:07.626 --> 01:09.384
for starting
my own chapter of the Spells.

01:09.553 --> 01:12.220
You know having a secret society
has always been my dream.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.572
A secret club is very fun.

01:13.723 --> 01:15.390
It reminds me of the secret
girls trips to Cabo

01:15.409 --> 01:17.150
I used to take
with Sarah McLachlan,

01:17.303 --> 01:18.744
Ani DiFranco and Joan Osborne.

01:18.821 --> 01:21.154
Why were they secret?
To ward off the paparazzi?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.897
-To ward off Dave Grohl.
-Oh.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.808
I love me some Davey G,
but they were girls trips.

01:24.901 --> 01:27.327
It was Joan Osborne's idea
to tell him that "Cabo" was code

01:27.479 --> 01:28.979
for taco night at Baja Fresh.

01:28.997 --> 01:30.738
So we'd go for a 45-minute
dinner at Baja Fresh

01:30.758 --> 01:32.591
with Dave Grohl,
and then leave for the airport

01:32.818 --> 01:35.260
to spend two weeks living it up
in Cabo without him.

01:35.412 --> 01:37.429
Noted. When planning
a girls trip to Cabo,

01:37.581 --> 01:39.581
keep it hush-hush
around David Grohl.

01:39.675 --> 01:41.100
Oh, my gosh, is that...

01:41.251 --> 01:44.161
Yes. The CB parts that were
on backorder finally arrived.

01:44.179 --> 01:46.179
Hey, Ham and Judy,
you guys want to get in

01:46.332 --> 01:49.516
on this sweet CB radio action
after school today?

01:49.668 --> 01:51.610
Sorry, Moon, we're busy.

01:51.761 --> 01:53.612
-We are?
-Yes. You know.

01:53.763 --> 01:55.839
The meeting about the thing.

01:55.858 --> 01:57.449
Ham, I think your sister
is insinuating

01:57.601 --> 02:00.452
that you two might be getting up
to mild teenage shenanigans

02:00.679 --> 02:02.362
that she would prefer
I not know about.

02:02.514 --> 02:04.364
-I fixed it.
<i> -TRUCKER (over radio):</i>
<i> This is HJ Hank.</i>

02:04.516 --> 02:06.366
<i> -Breaker, breaker,</i>
<i> looking for some takers.</i>
-Uh, oh...

02:06.518 --> 02:07.851
-Okay. Uh...
<i> -I'll be in the third stall</i>
<i> of the bathroom</i>

02:07.944 --> 02:09.444
<i> -at the church.</i>
-Dad.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.279
We didn't even get to hear
where to meet HJ Hank.

02:11.373 --> 02:13.615
-Okay.
-Uh, I forgot to tell you
that the best channel on here

02:13.709 --> 02:15.709
-is channel eight.
-Oh, that's where Ham and I

02:15.878 --> 02:18.303
made our trucker friend
during our CB radio phase.

02:18.455 --> 02:19.696
Ruff Barkins.

02:19.789 --> 02:21.640
He'd drive up and down
the highway nearby every day

02:21.809 --> 02:23.867
looking for his stolen dog Honk.

02:24.036 --> 02:25.293
-Did he ever find him?
-I don't know.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.961
Mom figured out
how to steal cable,

02:26.981 --> 02:28.872
and we never turned
the CB radio on again.

02:28.891 --> 02:31.984
Well, we'd better get to school
so you kids aren't late.

02:32.060 --> 02:34.561
Dad, can I try channel eight
when I get home?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.713
-If you insist, son.
-Yes.

02:36.806 --> 02:38.215
<i> TRUCKER 2:</i>
<i> This is Toe-Sucking Tony.</i>

02:38.233 --> 02:39.825
<i> -Pull off them socks.</i>
-(chuckling): Ah! Okay.

02:40.052 --> 02:41.051
Good Lord.

02:41.069 --> 02:42.235
<i> WOLF:</i>
<i> Who looks better for drinks</i>

02:42.329 --> 02:43.720
with my boy Cheesecake tonight?

02:43.739 --> 02:46.390
Mr. Cool Button Down
or my main man Johnny T-Shirt?

02:46.408 --> 02:47.741
I don't know.
Cheesecake is crazy,

02:47.893 --> 02:49.334
so I'd wear a life jacket,
a helmet

02:49.486 --> 02:50.669
and a bunch of extra underwear.

02:50.896 --> 02:52.320
Yeah, anything can happen

02:52.339 --> 02:53.821
with the C and C
Cheesecake Factory.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.415
You want to come along tonight?

02:55.567 --> 02:57.325
I think I'll stick to book club
with Alyson and Jerry.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.752
We're reading
the first installment

02:58.846 --> 03:00.179
of<i> Boggitha Johns:</i>
<i> Swamp Detective.</i>

03:00.330 --> 03:02.906
Look at us. I'm gonna drink
beers with Cheesecake,

03:02.999 --> 03:04.165
and you're in a book club
with your brother

03:04.185 --> 03:05.500
and my sister's boss.

03:05.627 --> 03:07.686
We're like the cover
of<i> Fun Marriage Magazine.</i>

03:07.837 --> 03:09.521
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> Ham and I have</i>
<i> gathered you here today</i>

03:09.690 --> 03:11.339
for a special opportunity.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.509
We're starting
an exclusive, top secret

03:14.603 --> 03:16.086
secret society tonight.

03:16.104 --> 03:18.530
Fine, I'll cancel
with my other secret society.

03:18.682 --> 03:20.440
Oh, you mean you and your little
brother going through

03:20.592 --> 03:22.534
your yearbook and putting an X
next to everyone

03:22.761 --> 03:26.020
-who's been mean to you?
-And that's an X on Bethany.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.432
Meet us tonight at the school's
decommissioned practice mine

03:28.450 --> 03:30.876
for the inaugural
induction ceremony

03:31.103 --> 03:34.362
of Saved by the Spells:
The Next Generation.

03:34.456 --> 03:37.365
(gasps)
Wait.<i> The</i> Saved by the Spells?

03:37.384 --> 03:39.109
The ones who did
that legendary prank?

03:39.127 --> 03:41.869
Mowing Keanu's perfect face
on the soccer field?

03:41.964 --> 03:43.129
The very same.

03:43.282 --> 03:44.281
-Okay.
-I'm in.
-Why not?

03:44.374 --> 03:45.632
Judy, I just want you to know

03:45.784 --> 03:47.300
that if we get caught,
I'll ask the judge

03:47.453 --> 03:49.119
to let me serve your time, too.

03:49.121 --> 03:51.021
Okay. Thanks, Gill. Thanks.

03:51.790 --> 03:52.880
Okay, I'm off to buy

03:52.975 --> 03:54.624
some book club snacks
at Val-U-Buy.

03:54.643 --> 03:55.734
Do you have my number
written on your arm

03:55.885 --> 03:57.461
in case
of a Cheesecake emergency?

03:57.554 --> 03:59.479
-A-check a-mate.
-Hon, you've got to stop

03:59.631 --> 04:02.223
saying "checkmate"
when you just mean "yes."

04:02.243 --> 04:03.408
But it sounds so cool.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.485
Goodbye, my little
book-club Bedelia.

04:05.637 --> 04:07.246
Mwah.

04:07.473 --> 04:08.305
(radio whirs)

04:08.398 --> 04:10.231
It's Bacon Bear with a 10-2.

04:10.325 --> 04:12.734
My heater's a-going
and my manners are showing.

04:12.902 --> 04:15.812
I'm looking for a trucker
by the name of Ruff Barkins.

04:15.831 --> 04:17.905
<i> BEEF (Southern accent):</i>
<i> Breaker, did you say</i>
<i> Ruff Barkins?</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:20.166
-Is that you, Ruff?
<i> -(regular accent): I'm his...</i>
<i> (clears throat)</i>

04:20.243 --> 04:22.486
<i> (Southern accent):</i>
<i> I'm his brother, Tuff Barkins.</i>

04:22.579 --> 04:24.337
<i> Ruff's been missing</i>
<i> for a while now.</i>

04:24.431 --> 04:26.098
<i>He was looking for his dog Honk,</i>

04:26.249 --> 04:28.508
<i> but he went a-Barkins</i>
<i> up the wrong tree.</i>

04:28.660 --> 04:30.936
Oh, no, the dognappers
got him, too?

04:31.087 --> 04:32.662
<i> That's what I think.</i>

04:32.681 --> 04:35.665
<i> But let me start way back</i>
<i> at the beginning of the story.</i>

04:35.759 --> 04:38.277
My brother Ruff started
long-haul trucking at 13.

04:38.428 --> 04:40.020
His feet couldn't
reach the pedals,

04:40.172 --> 04:41.338
so that's where I came in,

04:41.431 --> 04:42.948
down there pressing them
with my hands.

04:43.099 --> 04:44.841
<i> JUDY:</i>
<i> It is my grave</i>

04:44.860 --> 04:46.601
and distinguished honor
as high council

04:46.695 --> 04:49.513
of Saved by the Spells:
The Next Generation

04:49.606 --> 04:50.622
to welcome you all.

04:50.774 --> 04:52.532
Now, before I swear you in,

04:52.684 --> 04:55.368
I must warn you,
this is a secret society.

04:55.521 --> 04:58.630
No one can ever know you're
a member, especially no adults.

04:58.857 --> 05:01.133
-But what about my...
-No, Gill, you can't
tell your mom,

05:01.284 --> 05:02.467
even if she is your best friend.

05:02.694 --> 05:05.045
Okay, first things first,
according to the almanac,

05:05.197 --> 05:07.714
we all get to make up
at least one rule for the club.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.809
-Ham?
-Okay, my rule is...

05:11.036 --> 05:12.477
that we all
be best friends forever,

05:12.629 --> 05:14.721
and we never forget
what we mean to each other.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.648
My rule is the same as Ham's.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.966
My rule is we start talking
about those pranks.

05:19.061 --> 05:20.727
Okay, yes.

05:20.879 --> 05:22.228
I thought we could pay homage
to the original Spells

05:22.381 --> 05:25.398
by building a giant
papier-mâché Keanu Reeves head

05:25.492 --> 05:27.567
and setting it ablaze,
and then leaving a note

05:27.719 --> 05:28.976
telling everyone we did it.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.071
I've already got all
the supplies we need right here.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.647
This makes no sense. I love it.

05:32.741 --> 05:34.499
Could we get in big trouble
for starting a fire

05:34.651 --> 05:35.742
on school property? Yes.

05:35.952 --> 05:37.485
But being a part
of a secret club

05:37.579 --> 05:40.038
that pulls off a dangerous prank
is what every kid dreams of,

05:40.265 --> 05:42.507
and I believe there's a reason
we got the anonymous tip

05:42.734 --> 05:45.235
leading us to the Spells
on this auspicious anniversary,

05:45.253 --> 05:47.253
and that reason is destiny.

05:47.406 --> 05:48.755
Oh! I thought of my rule.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.423
During the prank, we have
to sing my favorite song,

05:50.576 --> 05:53.076
the Chili's
Baby Back Ribs jingle.

05:53.169 --> 05:54.761
Ugh, fine, sure.
(clears throat)

05:54.913 --> 05:56.763
And so, it is foretold.

05:56.915 --> 05:58.248
On the vernal equinox,

05:58.417 --> 06:00.025
Keanu's approximate
half-birthday,

06:00.252 --> 06:02.419
the prank shall be so.

06:02.437 --> 06:03.770
And remember,
don't tell any adults,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.989
or we could get in big trouble.

06:06.758 --> 06:07.866
Oh, Spello.

06:08.093 --> 06:10.535
-GOLOVKIN: Attention, class.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:10.687 --> 06:13.930
I'd like you to meet
our new student Joey TicTac.

06:14.023 --> 06:15.265
What up, what up?

06:15.283 --> 06:17.125
BOTH:
Undercover Principal Day.

06:20.196 --> 06:22.105
What is Undercover
Principal Day?

06:22.198 --> 06:24.441
Every year, Gibbons spends
one day, chosen at random,

06:24.459 --> 06:25.942
posing as a teen
to try to find out

06:25.961 --> 06:27.460
what's going on
with the students here.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.295
And every year, he tries
a different persona.

06:29.448 --> 06:31.372
<i> HAM:</i>
<i>Christian Devilsbane, goth kid.</i>

06:31.466 --> 06:32.632
Go, team.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.284
<i> -JUDY: Kip Willikers.</i>
-Howdy.

06:34.377 --> 06:36.395
And this year, he's that.

06:36.546 --> 06:39.398
What's up, my fellow
millennials? Let's YouTube.

06:39.549 --> 06:42.459
(exhales)
What is that loud noise?

06:42.477 --> 06:44.385
(inhales)
Oh, it's my breathing.

06:44.479 --> 06:46.646
(hoarse): My body feels
like a wet sack of rats.

06:46.798 --> 06:49.466
-What happened last night?
-You don't remember?

06:49.484 --> 06:51.317
Who knew book club
would be such a rager?

06:51.412 --> 06:54.746
Jerry and Alyson texted I never
even showed up to book club.

06:54.898 --> 06:56.248
I know I went to Val-U-Buy,

06:56.475 --> 06:57.974
and there were
free wine samples...

06:58.067 --> 07:00.252
-(gasps) Wolf! What is that?
-WOLF: My B button.

07:00.479 --> 07:02.646
Are we saying "B button"?
Is that what we say?

07:02.664 --> 07:04.164
Oh, something went very wrong.

07:04.316 --> 07:05.482
Cheesecake and I always agree:

07:05.651 --> 07:08.093
whatever happens,
no body modifications.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.669
We got to go see him
and find out

07:09.763 --> 07:11.988
what the helly
happened to my belly.

07:12.081 --> 07:14.433
Okay, so, it is bad
that Gibbons decided

07:14.660 --> 07:16.342
to do undercover principal
on the same week

07:16.511 --> 07:19.345
that we revived the Spells,
but he only does it for a day,

07:19.440 --> 07:22.182
so if we just avoid-- Hello!
(laughs)

07:22.334 --> 07:24.017
-Hi.
-What's up, barf bags?

07:24.169 --> 07:25.444
Mind if Joey gets to know-y?

07:25.595 --> 07:27.963
Who wants to tell me
their life story first?

07:27.965 --> 07:29.355
Oh, wonderful.

07:29.508 --> 07:32.025
I love how "Gangnam Style"
you all are.

07:32.177 --> 07:34.511
Anyway, gonna go peep
my epic new locker.

07:34.604 --> 07:36.346
Oh, and I can't wait
for tonight's meeting

07:36.364 --> 07:38.364
(whispers):
of Saved by the Spells.

07:38.517 --> 07:41.518
Thanks for the invite,
Crisp-dog.

07:41.536 --> 07:46.523
Crispin, did you invite Joey
TicTac to our secret society?

07:46.541 --> 07:48.208
I know what it's like
to be a new student.

07:48.302 --> 07:49.526
I didn't want Joey to feel

07:49.544 --> 07:51.194
the deep sense
of isolation I felt.

07:51.213 --> 07:53.213
You were instantly popular.
Everyone had a crush on you.

07:53.307 --> 07:54.698
-And yet...
-What should we do?

07:54.716 --> 07:55.790
Should we cancel the meeting?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.200
If we start driving right now,

07:57.219 --> 07:58.459
we can be in Arkansas
in three weeks.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.461
Or should we go ahead
with the meeting,

08:00.522 --> 08:02.889
but we also frame Joey TicTac
for murder?

08:02.983 --> 08:04.674
-Cover our bases?
-I love that you would go

08:04.726 --> 08:07.560
that hard, Kima, but I don't
think that we have to.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.896
Principal Gibbons is probably
coming because he thinks

08:10.048 --> 08:11.898
we're up to something bad,
so we'll just make sure

08:11.992 --> 08:13.474
he thinks it's a nice
friendship club,

08:13.568 --> 08:14.642
and we won't say anything
about the prank.

08:14.736 --> 08:17.162
Okay, so,
I'll go tell Joey TicTac

08:17.313 --> 08:19.239
not to tell Gibbons
about the prank.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.724
Crispin, no.

08:20.742 --> 08:23.818
Wait, Cheesecake lives
in a trailer behind the bar?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.987
Uh-oh, someone sounds jealous.

08:26.081 --> 08:27.564
Oh, hey, guys.
Want to go get a drink?

08:27.733 --> 08:28.990
Yes. Wait, no.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.158
-Why did I say yes?
-That's Cheesecake for you.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.011
Hey, C-cake,
know anything about this?

08:33.162 --> 08:34.237
Oof. Nope.

08:34.406 --> 08:35.847
(whistles)
She's a beaut, though.

08:36.074 --> 08:37.331
What is that, aquamarine?

08:37.392 --> 08:38.758
So you don't remember
last night, either?

08:38.910 --> 08:41.411
Mm, last thing I remember,
we went to Junkyard Kyle's

08:41.546 --> 08:42.670
for the Junker Jump.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.505
Oh, we met up
with my main man Old Jody Jr.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.416
Let's go see
if he knows anything.

08:46.434 --> 08:47.433
It's about a ten-minute walk.

08:47.510 --> 08:49.176
How many beers
are you each gonna need?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.588
I'll just grab a 12-pack and
we'll stop for more on the way.

08:51.606 --> 08:55.182
(chuckles) Didn't expect to see
you three back so soon.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.869
-Wait, I was here last night?
-Yep, for the Junker Jump.

08:57.979 --> 09:00.872
People come from far and wide
to put bricks on gas pedals

09:01.024 --> 09:02.541
and launch old cars
into the quarry.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.859
Did either of you pierce
my husband's belly button?

09:04.953 --> 09:06.878
Ma'am, I did not pierce
that B button.

09:07.105 --> 09:08.772
I really wish you guys
would stop saying "B button."

09:08.790 --> 09:10.774
-That's what it's called.
-It's the medical term.

09:10.792 --> 09:12.717
We'd love to know
what happened to us last night.

09:12.794 --> 09:15.369
I did sell you some
of my homemade moonshine.

09:15.463 --> 09:17.130
This stuff will shake up
the old Etch A Sketch.

09:17.299 --> 09:18.631
Similar thing
happened to me once.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.617
I took mushrooms and,
well, blah, blah, blah,

09:20.619 --> 09:22.060
I woke up the next morning
married

09:22.287 --> 09:25.546
to my brother Old Jesse Jr.'s
ex-wife Sharon Sr.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.624
It wasn't until the next time
I took mushrooms

09:27.717 --> 09:30.235
that I remembered
the wedding ceremony.

09:30.386 --> 09:32.128
My point is, probably
the best way to find out

09:32.147 --> 09:34.464
what happened is to buy
some more moonshine

09:34.482 --> 09:35.907
and follow
in your own footsteps.

09:36.059 --> 09:38.225
Five bucks a pop,
and the truth is yours.

09:38.303 --> 09:39.636
It's a good deal.

09:39.654 --> 09:40.912
Okay, but let's only
get drunk enough

09:41.139 --> 09:43.323
to remember what happened,
and no drunker.

09:43.475 --> 09:45.475
Well, it is already 4:00 p.m.

09:45.568 --> 09:47.977
-(laughs) Somewhere.
-Yeah. Here.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.921
-It's 4:00 p.m. here.
-(laughs)

09:49.998 --> 09:51.331
Yeah, you get it.

09:51.499 --> 09:53.316
JUDY:
Okay, the papier-mâché
prank head is hidden.

09:53.409 --> 09:57.337
Now, we know Gibbons only ever
poses as a student for one day.

09:57.489 --> 09:58.597
So we'll just show him
a good, wholesome time,

09:58.748 --> 10:00.173
and tomorrow,
things will go back to normal.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.675
Smash that "what up" button,
fam.

10:02.828 --> 10:04.936
This is gonna be
straight Tide Pod.

10:05.088 --> 10:07.272
Great! (clears throat)
Well, we're just gonna do

10:07.423 --> 10:09.182
what we do at all
our secret meetings and, uh,

10:09.334 --> 10:12.352
go around and say something
nice about someone else.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.280
I'll start. Uh...
Kima is a great friend.

10:15.431 --> 10:18.024
Gill looks like a peanut.

10:18.176 --> 10:19.433
Thank you, Kima.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.344
My favorite thing about Ham
is that when he sees

10:21.363 --> 10:23.121
that I'm falling asleep,
he'll puts Oreos

10:23.272 --> 10:24.772
on my eyes to block the light.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.066
Uh, and Joey,
something nice to tell you,

10:27.127 --> 10:28.460
even though you're new,

10:28.687 --> 10:31.371
is that it's like
we've known you for years.

10:31.465 --> 10:32.964
Oh, wow, thank you.

10:33.116 --> 10:35.133
You've made me feel
so welcome here.

10:35.284 --> 10:37.043
Mm, y'okay,
well, that's our time.

10:37.195 --> 10:38.862
Got to get home
and do our homework

10:38.864 --> 10:41.197
because of how much
we love school.

10:41.290 --> 10:43.032
Well, I think he bought it.

10:43.051 --> 10:44.567
And tomorrow,
he goes back to being Gibbons,

10:44.569 --> 10:46.728
and we get back
to planning our prank.

10:47.964 --> 10:50.023
-You got to be kidding me.
-What's up?

10:53.044 --> 10:55.153
Joey, you're back?

10:55.322 --> 10:56.729
Today's a schi-zool day,
isn't it?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.491
I couldn't miss tonight's
Spells meeting for the world.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.217
Audi five million. Dab.

11:01.219 --> 11:03.511
Look, he's probably just
trying to get us to slip up.

11:03.513 --> 11:05.905
But the prank isn't until
Friday, so we just need to do

11:06.057 --> 11:07.314
the same thing
we did last night,

11:07.334 --> 11:08.908
and I'm sure
he'll lose interest.

Ugh, not again.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.188
This is fun and all, but we
just keep getting very drunk

11:30.415 --> 11:33.249
on moonshine every night and
we're no closer to the truth.

11:33.268 --> 11:36.602
Uh, baby, was that big tattoo
of purple grapes always there?

11:36.697 --> 11:38.938
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.366
This ends now.
Wake up, Cheesecake.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.185
(grunts)
What's up? We doing mimosas?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.112
-Good morning, Judy.
-Uh, hey, Dad.

11:46.264 --> 11:48.948
Let's say you were in a group.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.450
Like a fishing group?

11:50.602 --> 11:53.937
Sure. And there was a big
fishing, uh, thing coming up,

11:53.955 --> 11:57.716
but there was one fishing friend
that you didn't want to come

11:57.867 --> 12:00.293
because that friend would
get you in really big trouble

12:00.445 --> 12:03.796
with the principal, uh,
at your, um, boat.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.615
This fish thing,
does it coincide

12:05.633 --> 12:07.208
with the vernal equinox?

12:07.302 --> 12:08.709
Yes. Wait, how did you...

12:08.729 --> 12:13.306
(gasps) You were in the original
Saved by the Spells?

12:13.458 --> 12:15.066
I can neither confirm nor deny.

12:15.293 --> 12:17.235
Nor do I know who might
have sent an anonymous tip

12:17.386 --> 12:20.463
to Judy Tobin at the school
paper suggesting she may want

12:20.482 --> 12:22.723
to investigate the
decommissioned practice mine.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.501
Well, I got your anonymous tip
and I restarted the club,

12:25.503 --> 12:27.412
but then Principal Gibbons
decided to do

12:27.563 --> 12:29.822
-Undercover Principal this week.
-Oh, dear.

12:29.899 --> 12:32.250
And now he won't leave,
and the prank is tonight.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.327
And if he busts us,
we'll be in huge trouble.

12:34.479 --> 12:35.828
Well, if he keeps coming back,

12:35.981 --> 12:37.480
maybe he's not trying
to bust you.

12:37.615 --> 12:39.591
Maybe he just enjoys
the camaraderie.

12:39.742 --> 12:43.595
You know, being part of a group
can make a person feel special,

12:43.746 --> 12:46.247
and those friendships
can never be replaced,

12:46.341 --> 12:48.825
long after your fellow
club members have graduated

12:48.843 --> 12:50.843
and moved on to Juneau
or Fairbanks

12:50.996 --> 12:53.271
or the hustle and bustle
of Indianapolis.

12:53.348 --> 12:55.089
You'll miss those days
so terribly,

12:55.108 --> 12:57.183
you'll find yourself
jonesing for some...

12:57.335 --> 12:58.851
(gasps)
Jones. Joan. Joan Osborne.

12:59.004 --> 13:00.612
Dave Grohl! (gasps)
That's it.

13:00.763 --> 13:03.172
We'll take him to Baja Fresh.
Metaphorically speaking.

13:03.191 --> 13:04.674
I don't know
what you're talking about,

13:04.692 --> 13:07.026
but if it helps keep the secret,
I'm all for it.

13:07.103 --> 13:08.953
Good lunch-er-noon, my Spells.

13:09.105 --> 13:10.847
If you're noticing
that I'm in an amazing mood,

13:10.865 --> 13:13.866
there is a reason for that,
and I'm gonna tell you about it.

13:13.943 --> 13:15.701
Oh, great,
another Judy-centered lunchtime.

13:15.854 --> 13:19.022
Yes, it is centered on me
because I figured something out.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.540
Gibbons is obviously
hanging around us

13:20.634 --> 13:23.359
to catch us doing a big prank,
so we just have to invite him

13:23.378 --> 13:25.528
to do a small prank
we won't get in trouble for,

13:25.530 --> 13:26.971
and then do the real one
later that night.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.881
That's right,
we'll take Dave Grohl

13:29.034 --> 13:31.792
for tacos at Baja Fresh
at 6:00 p.m.

13:31.812 --> 13:34.145
and then the rest of us
will go to Cabo at 10:00.

13:34.297 --> 13:37.056
Ooh, I'm gonna get the Baja Bowl
with the wild-cut crispy wahoo.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.043
We're not actually going
to Baja Fre-- oh, oh, oh.

13:40.061 --> 13:41.711
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

13:41.729 --> 13:43.713
What's the dealio, squad goals?

13:43.731 --> 13:45.882
What are all my best friends
Venmoing about?

13:45.900 --> 13:47.717
It's the vernal equinox,
so the Spells

13:47.735 --> 13:49.977
-got to be doing something.
-Joey's right.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.722
Tonight's the big night
of the big prank.

13:52.740 --> 13:55.224
So, we'll meet up
in the parking lot at 6:00 p.m.

13:55.243 --> 13:57.151
-just like we planned.
-And after that,

13:57.170 --> 13:58.652
we go to Baja Fresh?

13:58.672 --> 14:00.004
BOTH:
Crispin, no.

14:00.156 --> 14:01.414
Hey, Judy, wait up.

14:01.566 --> 14:03.249
I just wanted to say
thanks again

14:03.401 --> 14:04.917
for inviting me
to the prank tonight.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.071
Well, you're part
of the group, I guess.

14:08.239 --> 14:10.406
Yeah, I've never had friends
like this before.

14:10.408 --> 14:12.925
I was six-foot-two
by the time I was eight

14:13.019 --> 14:15.244
and kids always thought I was
a teacher or the principal,

14:15.263 --> 14:16.913
so eventually I just became one.

14:16.931 --> 14:19.098
I mean, I plan to become one.
I'm 15.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.676
Any-Howard the Duck,
I'm really excited for tonight.

14:22.845 --> 14:24.845
I'm gonna RT and fave it.

14:25.014 --> 14:26.422
So, when my at-that-point
ex-wife

14:26.515 --> 14:28.182
Sharon Sr. and I
took mushrooms together

14:28.201 --> 14:29.759
-for the fifth time...
-Enough.

14:29.777 --> 14:31.536
If we have one more night
like we've been having,

14:31.763 --> 14:33.779
we're gonna end up in a human
centipede with Cheesecake.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.448
-I call middle.
-No fair.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.450
We're not leaving
until you tell us what happened.

14:37.602 --> 14:40.420
Until then, no more moonshine
for us or you.

14:40.529 --> 14:41.454
Oh, I don't drink.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.548
Old Jody Jr.
is old clean and sober.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.050
But sure, yeah, here's-- yeah,
I'll tell you what happened.

14:46.277 --> 14:48.535
Cheesecake and Wolf
showed up at the Junker Jump

14:48.597 --> 14:49.795
19 sheets to the wind.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.464
And you, Honeybee,
showed up with someone

14:51.558 --> 14:54.117
named Barbara, the wine
sample lady from Val-U-Buy,

14:54.210 --> 14:56.953
and I sold all of you some
of my world-famous moonshine.

14:56.971 --> 14:58.638
You began making
increasingly wild bets

14:58.732 --> 15:00.899
on which car would fly
the farthest in the Junker Jump.

15:01.008 --> 15:02.458
HONEYBEE:
Who were we betting with? You?

15:02.477 --> 15:04.068
Oh, no, I'm sober
from that, too.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.645
You bet with each other.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.388
The loser had to get
a B button piercing

15:07.482 --> 15:09.632
-from the winner.
-I tagged that tum?

15:09.651 --> 15:12.301
Yep. Night two, after you guys
had more moonshine,

15:12.395 --> 15:14.061
Honeybee,
you lost a bet with Wolf

15:14.139 --> 15:15.580
and had to get a tattoo
of his choosing.

15:15.731 --> 15:18.416
And as everyone knows, Wolf,
well, he loves purple grapes.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.660
I think what I love most
about them

15:20.812 --> 15:22.069
is how purple they are.

15:22.163 --> 15:23.496
Now, night three,
you actually tried

15:23.648 --> 15:25.665
to gamble your dad's van
in the Junker Jump

15:25.741 --> 15:27.166
before Junkyard Kyle stepped in

15:27.260 --> 15:29.093
and bet that you couldn't
join the Navy.

15:29.245 --> 15:30.670
Turns out, uh, you could.

15:30.764 --> 15:32.004
Shore leave is gonna be sick!

15:32.098 --> 15:33.506
But I think you're off the hook

15:33.658 --> 15:35.841
since you all signed up
under the name Boggitha Johns?

15:35.936 --> 15:38.177
WOLF:
But wait, why didn't you
just tell us what happened

15:38.271 --> 15:39.829
the first time we asked you?

15:39.922 --> 15:41.831
Honestly, I've been trying to
unload that moonshine for years.

15:41.891 --> 15:43.090
I need the jars.

15:43.259 --> 15:45.092
I'm starting a new jelly company
called Old Jammy Jr.

15:45.170 --> 15:47.111
Now, tell me again
why you're getting a tattoo

15:47.338 --> 15:48.762
of a glass of milk.

15:48.782 --> 15:50.064
To go with Honeybee's tattoo.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.175
Because we go together
like grapes and milk.

15:52.193 --> 15:54.360
(chuckles) You know,
you dip the grape in the milk

15:54.512 --> 15:55.936
and you eat it. So refreshing.

15:56.030 --> 15:58.790
Aw, now it's like our B buttons
are married, too.

15:59.017 --> 16:00.199
Look at us,
making mistakes together

16:00.293 --> 16:02.627
and then making them again
so all our mistakes match.

16:02.854 --> 16:05.621
We're like the cover
of<i> Solid Marriage Magazine.</i>

16:06.691 --> 16:08.615
Well, I think we got
all the litter.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.193
Great prank, guys.

16:10.211 --> 16:11.694
That's the prank?

16:11.787 --> 16:13.379
We're the Saved by the Spells,
for ALF's sake.

16:13.531 --> 16:15.364
This could be
our last night together.

16:15.383 --> 16:17.550
I mean, you never know whose dad
might suddenly get a new job

16:17.702 --> 16:19.869
in another state
and won't be here on Monday.

16:19.962 --> 16:21.813
Sorry, Joey, but we aren't like
the old Spells.

16:21.964 --> 16:24.465
We're not gonna do
some big thing.

16:24.633 --> 16:29.045
It's like our new motto says:
"We just pick up all the litter,

16:29.063 --> 16:30.530
and that's the whole prank."

16:32.383 --> 16:34.141
Oh, Keanu, heed our call,

16:34.160 --> 16:35.809
bless this field
with your mighty jaw.

16:35.887 --> 16:39.572
Your face and eyes we invoke,
for a bodacious prank,

16:39.724 --> 16:41.165

17:01.003 --> 17:03.688
But you got to admit,
he looks a lot like Joey.

17:07.769 --> 17:10.436
Principal Gibbons,
we-we thought you were not here.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.698
I came back to hole-punch
a recipe for my recipe binder,

17:13.849 --> 17:16.609
and imagine my surprise
at finding this dangerous,

17:16.761 --> 17:20.263
big prank that is not allowed
but also probably

17:20.281 --> 17:22.540
made some people feel left out.

17:22.767 --> 17:23.857
Go home, all of you.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.209
I'll see you on Monday

17:25.361 --> 17:27.453
what the punishment is
for something bad

17:27.605 --> 17:30.456
and hurtful like this.

17:30.608 --> 17:33.826
Oh. What if<i> Gibbons</i>
was one of us?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.628
I've got an idea
where the dognappers

17:35.722 --> 17:37.446
might have taken Ruff and Honk.

17:37.465 --> 17:39.706
There's an abandoned
weigh station near Death Cliff

17:39.801 --> 17:41.392
I found using online
satellite maps.

17:41.544 --> 17:43.877
-Now, if you want,
I can go there myself.
-(regular accent): No!

17:43.897 --> 17:46.547
(Southern accent): I mean,
I happen to be right near there.

17:46.641 --> 17:49.716
So I can investigate
since I know it's your bedtime.

17:49.811 --> 17:51.294
How do you know it's my bedtime?

17:51.312 --> 17:52.737
Well, I just figured you adhered

17:52.964 --> 17:55.298
to the trucker's
standard sleep scale.

17:55.391 --> 17:57.817
-Oh, of course I do.
-And Bacon Bear,

17:57.969 --> 18:01.228
don't forget to polish your gear
and hose down your mud flaps.

18:01.322 --> 18:03.897
That's trucker talk for brush
your teeth and wash your face.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.992
<i> GIBBONS:</i>

-Look, before you give me
a very bad punishment

18:09.905 --> 18:12.906
which I definitely deserve,
I know I took the wrong lesson

18:13.000 --> 18:15.334
from Joan Osborne's
most popular song.

18:15.486 --> 18:17.002
"Pensacola"? "Crazy Baby?"

18:17.155 --> 18:18.337
I meant "One of Us."

18:18.431 --> 18:20.431
I have a feeling
that when you were 15,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.174
you didn't have
a group of friends.

18:22.327 --> 18:24.176
And you really were very tall.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.512
And now that you're
the principal, well, it's like,

18:26.664 --> 18:29.999

what if you got to be one of us?

18:37.099 --> 18:38.357
I'm sorry we lied to you.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.193
Thank you, but of course,
I don't have any idea

18:41.287 --> 18:42.620
what you're talking about.

18:42.771 --> 18:44.438
Okay. But for what it's worth,

18:44.457 --> 18:48.292
if you were our age,
I would totally be your friend.

18:48.444 --> 18:51.111
Well, I appreciate that, Judy,
but unfortunately,

18:51.131 --> 18:52.521
the ringleader behind the prank

18:52.540 --> 18:54.039
will still be expelled
from school.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.692
I have no choice but to expel...

18:56.785 --> 18:58.194
Joey TicTac, forever.

18:58.212 --> 19:01.364
I know you were all very,
very good friends with Joey.

19:01.457 --> 19:03.624
-Some might even
say best friends.
-Mm.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.459
So that will have
to be punishment enough

19:05.553 --> 19:07.219
for your involvement
with this character

19:07.372 --> 19:09.814
who was truly a rebel
and a bit of a maverick.

19:09.965 --> 19:12.041
Oh, and Judy,
I've gone ahead and closed

19:12.059 --> 19:14.393
the school's decommissioned
practice mine.

19:14.545 --> 19:16.729
-I understand.
-I should probably close

19:16.805 --> 19:19.048
the school's decommissioned
practice meatpacking plant

19:19.066 --> 19:21.475
as well, but I'm just
so swamped with work.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.720
I just hope no MC Skat Kats
on the high council

19:24.739 --> 19:26.647
get any cray-cray ideas.

tied to a ticking time bomb
on the railroad tracks.

19:37.402 --> 19:39.177
(higher-pitched): Bacon Bear,
this is Ruff Barkins.

19:39.253 --> 19:41.179
I don't know how to thank you.

19:41.255 --> 19:43.347
Well, you could
stop by my house.

19:43.574 --> 19:44.740
I'll give you the address.

19:44.759 --> 19:47.501
I wish we could,
but while I was rescuing Ruff,

19:47.595 --> 19:50.688
somebody took my cat
Puff Meow-kins.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.098
Dang. You guys
can't catch a break.

19:53.193 --> 19:56.843
Also, never give out your
address over a CB radio, son.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.272
Never. Now, we could sure
use some ideas

20:00.425 --> 20:03.259
on where a cat-napping ring
might be around these parts.

20:03.352 --> 20:06.704
But I don't suppose
you've got the time to help us.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.614

-Wonderful.
