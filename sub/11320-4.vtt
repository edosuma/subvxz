WEBVTT

00:23.606 --> 00:24.899
Are you lecturing me?

00:26.151 --> 00:27.152
Forget it.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.820
Let's quit.

00:29.654 --> 00:30.780
Let's forget it all.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.241
Look here, Mr. Han.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.409
Excuse me.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.953
You're Ms. Oh Mi-ran's
daughter-in-law, correct?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.041
Yes.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.709
I'm glad you're here.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.711
He's the social worker
who's in charge of her case.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.338
You haven't scheduled
the interview yet, have you?

00:48.131 --> 00:50.592
Why don't we do it now,
since you're both here?

00:52.093 --> 00:54.637
Right now?

00:54.971 --> 00:55.972
Yes.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.516
I originally came
to interview someone else.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.018
What great timing.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.103
It would've been a pain
to schedule a day anyway.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.438
You should.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.817
Starting the recording.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.235
You've made

01:09.319 --> 01:12.030
a difficult decision
for your mother-in-law.

01:12.572 --> 01:16.534
I'm sorry for putting you through
this complicated verification process too.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.038
You see, there are people
who illegally enter

01:20.371 --> 01:23.583
into fake marriages
because situations are dire.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.377
We noticed

01:26.795 --> 01:28.546
that you registered your marriage
all of a sudden.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.215
That's why

01:30.548 --> 01:33.218
we have no choice but to investigate.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.179
May I ask you

01:36.638 --> 01:38.014
a few questions?

01:38.807 --> 01:39.808
Of course.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.059
Yes.

01:41.309 --> 01:44.729
Ms. Kang Hye-su,
your job is listed here as a chef.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.398
Do you know
when she got her cooking certificate?

01:49.192 --> 01:50.360
It should be about two years ago.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.737
She got her cooking certificate
for western cuisine

01:52.821 --> 01:54.447
when we began dating.

01:55.323 --> 01:58.576
Honey, you got your cooking certificate
for Korean food before then, right?

02:00.370 --> 02:01.371
Yes.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.455
Gosh.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.499
You have a great memory.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.794
I was very proud of her

02:07.919 --> 02:09.212
for getting her certificates.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.296
I see.

02:10.922 --> 02:12.382
Where was

02:12.465 --> 02:15.093
the last vacation you took?

02:15.927 --> 02:18.221
We went skiing in Yongpyong.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.848
Around when?

02:20.598 --> 02:23.518
It was for 2 nights and 3 days
from December 25th.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.271
Do you want our lodging documentation?

02:26.646 --> 02:28.189
I'd appreciate it.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.151
Was it just the two of you?

02:31.401 --> 02:33.236
I heard you have a child. Did she also...

02:33.862 --> 02:34.863
She went with us too,

02:35.321 --> 02:36.322
since she was on break.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.825
You must get along well
with her child too.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.410
Of course. We're close.

02:40.827 --> 02:41.828
What's the child's name?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.627
Eun-seong. Cha Eun-seong.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.340
I knew that, of course.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.093
I'm sure.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.471
Eun-seong must be happy,

03:00.555 --> 03:02.348
getting such a handsome stepdad.

03:02.891 --> 03:03.808
You're too kind.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.643
The person you are trying
to reach cannot...

03:06.102 --> 03:08.688
She isn't answering her phone,
and she isn't coming either.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.987
Give it to me.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.239
It really is my mom's picture.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.699
It definitely is not.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.200
You saw wrong.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.162
This is something little kids cannot see.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.747
Not suitable for minors.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.171
I'm sure

03:33.463 --> 03:35.381
it was Mom and that man.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.218
Are you sure it wasn't?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.721
That man?

03:41.804 --> 03:42.805
Who?

03:45.099 --> 03:46.100
Do you know him?

03:47.185 --> 03:51.231
Auntie, is my mom getting married?

03:52.482 --> 03:53.483
Eun-seong.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.153
What kind of nonsense is that?

03:57.612 --> 04:00.365
Why would she get married
when she has you?

04:01.491 --> 04:03.243
She isn't, right?

04:04.577 --> 04:07.163
You submitted receipts
for gifts you exchanged

04:07.497 --> 04:09.832
while you were dating.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.045
You also submitted testimonies
of people around you.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.215
The donor hasn't submitted testimonies
from her side though.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.802
Right. I will submit them soon.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.556
Is there a problem?

04:25.932 --> 04:27.100
Please submit

04:27.475 --> 04:29.769
more documents that we can send over
to the head office.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.896
These seem to be a bit insufficient.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.191
We need more proof

04:35.316 --> 04:38.653
that the two of you had really dated.

04:39.862 --> 04:40.863
Okay.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.573
Okay, then.

04:42.907 --> 04:45.326
Let's end here for today.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.704
Let's meet again
once you've submitted the documents.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.456
All right.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.250
By the way,

04:52.709 --> 04:53.960
the child's name...

04:54.210 --> 04:55.211
Eun-seong.

04:55.878 --> 04:57.005
Cha Eun-seong.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.760
May I meet with her?

05:04.679 --> 05:05.680
Eun-seong?

05:06.180 --> 05:07.181
Yes.

05:17.984 --> 05:18.985
Goodbye, then.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.539
Why does he want to meet the kid?

05:32.165 --> 05:33.708
Doesn't he have better things to do?

05:35.084 --> 05:36.127
Your kid is smart, right?

05:36.711 --> 05:39.130
Let's go work on her.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.590
I'm sorry,

05:42.383 --> 05:44.260
but I can't do it.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.431
It's not right getting my child
to put up an act too.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.893
I've hurt her a lot over the years.

05:53.478 --> 05:54.479
I can't do it.

05:55.772 --> 05:56.773
Then what do we do?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.900
We need to do all we can first.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.277
Is hurting her that big of a deal?

06:01.569 --> 06:03.446
Didn't you expect this much?

06:07.033 --> 06:08.493
You have the lunch shift tomorrow, right?

06:09.952 --> 06:10.953
Good.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.455
Let's have dinner tomorrow.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.665
First, I need to get closer with the kid.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.169
Go first,

06:18.836 --> 06:19.837
and convince her.

06:41.692 --> 06:42.652
What is this?

06:42.735 --> 06:43.736
Are you engaged?

06:45.905 --> 06:46.989
How did you find that?

06:47.365 --> 06:48.991
Does that really matter right now?

06:49.784 --> 06:50.743
Explain yourself first.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.203
What's going on? Who is he?

06:52.453 --> 06:53.955
Did Eun-seong see this?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.206
I made an excuse

06:56.165 --> 06:57.333
to her.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.627
What's going on?

06:59.836 --> 07:00.837
Who is he?

07:01.963 --> 07:05.091
How could you get engaged
without telling me?

07:07.927 --> 07:08.928
Give it to me.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.012
I'll explain later.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.097
Later when?

07:12.473 --> 07:13.850
Eun-seong will hear you.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.728
I'll explain later.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.816
I have a favor to ask you too.

07:21.899 --> 07:23.359
Once she goes to nursery,

07:23.484 --> 07:25.111
I'll come to the shop
and explain everything.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.821
Go now. Go.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.463
Eun-seong, what are you doing?

07:44.088 --> 07:45.089
I'm reading.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.257
You're reading?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.177
Do you want to play with me?

07:49.343 --> 07:50.678
No, I'm fine.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.221
You're fine?

07:52.763 --> 07:54.515
Did you have fun with Auntie today?

07:54.640 --> 07:55.641
Yes.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.393
-But Mom,
-Yes?

07:57.852 --> 07:59.854
I'm busy reading this book.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.523
Okay.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.858
I won't talk.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.878
I heard you went to see my aunt.

08:24.629 --> 08:25.630
Yes.

08:30.843 --> 08:31.844
Be understanding.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.471
She still misses

08:33.888 --> 08:35.848
Seok-hwan so much.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.935
She's aged a lot.

08:39.852 --> 08:40.853
Be good to her.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.021
Stop stressing her out.

08:42.146 --> 08:43.940
How did I stress her out?

08:45.191 --> 08:46.901
I got my act together a while ago.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.071
I'm taking a few days off.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.240
My friend opened a store

08:52.323 --> 08:53.449
and asked me to help out.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.494
If my business goes well,

08:56.827 --> 08:58.329
I'll help you pay off your debt.

08:59.455 --> 09:00.456
Thanks,

09:00.873 --> 09:02.124
but I'm not in debt anymore.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.501
I told you I paid it off.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.002
Who would believe that?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.213
Just trust me.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.675
Seung-ju.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.218
Hye-su?

09:12.885 --> 09:13.886
May I have a word?

09:14.303 --> 09:15.721
What are you doing there?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.144
Ta-da.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.939
What is all of this?

09:25.273 --> 09:26.524
Well...

09:27.942 --> 09:29.235
They're from Mr. Han.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.822
I heard you two are having dinner
with Eun-seong later.

09:33.614 --> 09:35.283
He says they're presents for her.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.661
Gosh.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.789
Won't she be happy to get a new dad?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.125
She's smart,

09:44.292 --> 09:45.835
so I'm sure she'll do well.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.174
One, two, three.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.593
Oh my gosh!

09:53.676 --> 09:54.677
Oh my.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.345
What is all this?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.473
My friend sent them for you.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.059
It's so pretty.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.728
-May I try it on?
-Of course.

10:06.647 --> 10:07.648
What friend?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.610
Do you have a friend

10:10.776 --> 10:13.029
other than Auntie Ju-yeon
that I don't know?

10:13.321 --> 10:15.031
Try it on first.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.198
Let's talk on the way.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.283
Okay.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.868
Where are we going?

10:20.661 --> 10:21.662
Come here.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.083
You're so good.

10:33.841 --> 10:35.843
These are the appetizers.
Which would you like?

10:37.928 --> 10:38.929
Gosh.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.389
Is it a special day today?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.726
Which one should we have?

10:44.644 --> 10:45.811
We'll take the chocolate.

10:45.895 --> 10:46.896
Thank you.

10:47.605 --> 10:48.606
Shall we eat this?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.691
It looks so good.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.614
To be honest, Eun-seong,

10:57.698 --> 11:00.326
I have a boyfriend.

11:00.910 --> 11:01.911
A boyfriend?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.204
You're dating?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.039
That's right.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.416
So I want to introduce him to you today.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.251
Who is he?

11:10.628 --> 11:11.921
He is...

11:13.255 --> 11:15.049
The thing is...

11:15.633 --> 11:17.301
You're here already.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.969
Sorry, I'm late.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.854
This man is your boyfriend?

11:30.731 --> 11:31.732
Yes.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.655
Gosh, the dress
and shoes look great on you.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.031
I'll give you toys later.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.033
I brought a whole bunch in my car.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.133
I've been too embarrassed to tell you,

11:58.300 --> 11:59.301
but...

12:00.428 --> 12:02.555
Were you shocked, Eun-seon?

12:03.180 --> 12:04.640
It's Eun-seong.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.813
Yes. Eun-seong.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.108
Well...

12:15.192 --> 12:16.861
Shall we order first?

12:17.361 --> 12:18.654
What do you like, Eun-seong?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.283
Excuse me.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.367
Yes?

12:23.659 --> 12:24.952
What would you like, Hye-su?

12:25.119 --> 12:26.412
I'll have...

12:27.163 --> 12:28.831
Eun-seong, I'll pick for you, okay?

12:32.501 --> 12:33.502
What's wrong, Eun-seong?

12:33.669 --> 12:34.920
Do you need to use the restroom?

12:35.546 --> 12:36.547
What are you doing?

12:38.883 --> 12:39.884
Eun-seong.

12:40.718 --> 12:41.719
Eun-seong!

12:47.683 --> 12:48.684
Eun-seong.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.148
Eun-seong, stop.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.566
Stop.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.152
Let's go back in. Let's talk inside.

12:58.861 --> 12:59.987
I hate that man.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.572
I can't stand him.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.658
Today won't work. Let's try another time.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.993
-Eun-seong!
-Eun-seong.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.128
What a brat.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.719
Hello?

13:24.053 --> 13:26.764
Hello, this is the hospital.
Is this Mr. Han Ji-hun?

13:27.306 --> 13:28.307
Yes, it is.

13:28.766 --> 13:32.603
Your mother refuses to have
the transplant operation.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.362
-Gosh.
-I'm going home.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.949
I told you it's too late already.
We can't cancel it.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.200
I don't want it.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.911
I won't sell my son
in order to save my life.

13:49.036 --> 13:50.246
Who knows where she's from?

13:50.329 --> 13:51.830
How could you do something so dangerous?

13:52.081 --> 13:54.375
Get your money back from her
and undo this!

13:54.458 --> 13:56.669
It's too late.
We've already registered our marriage.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.629
What?

13:59.505 --> 14:00.506
You...

14:00.589 --> 14:02.341
You even registered your marriage?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.219
How else could you have
a daughter-in-law donate her liver?

14:11.392 --> 14:12.393
Ji-hun.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.270
Why do I want to save you so badly?

14:15.646 --> 14:16.647
Yes.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.611
This is so embarrassing.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.196
Do I need to say this myself?

14:28.701 --> 14:29.827
Because you're family.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.329
You're my only family.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.164
Got it?

14:38.210 --> 14:40.921
Don't say anything,
and just act like a mother-in-law.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.799
I know you quit that career early
because you had no talent,

14:44.216 --> 14:45.301
but at least try.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.011
Don't get caught by the hospital.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.104
Hi, Auntie.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.106
I'll take that.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.900
Goodness.

15:01.901 --> 15:02.902
Auntie.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.279
Do you really not want to see Eun-seong?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.200
Don't you want to see Eun-seong?

15:11.201 --> 15:13.954
She looks just like Seok-hwan.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.873
She's totally his doppelganger.

15:16.290 --> 15:17.791
You'd be shocked if you saw.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.254
Can't you stop being stubborn
and forgive her?

15:23.547 --> 15:26.050
How could someone so kind
and great as you be

15:26.342 --> 15:28.469
so mean only to Hye-su?

15:29.720 --> 15:31.263
I know what you're up to.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.140
Don't waste your breath.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.975
What do you mean?

15:35.309 --> 15:36.602
It's true.

15:37.186 --> 15:39.313
I know I was abandoned with nowhere to go,

15:39.605 --> 15:41.899
but it's still not easy to take in someone

15:42.358 --> 15:44.068
who isn't related to you at all.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.820
You are a total angel.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.573
You may not have wings,
but you're an angel. Right?

15:50.157 --> 15:52.326
You punk. Stop babbling.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.955
Taking you in
is the biggest regret of my life.

15:57.748 --> 15:58.958
I understand why.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.459
I'll give you that.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.879
Let it go.

16:04.505 --> 16:06.548
It isn't just her fault
that Seok-hwan died.

16:07.716 --> 16:08.676
Don't you remember

16:08.759 --> 16:11.011
how much you adored her
when she was young?

16:11.637 --> 16:14.223
Just think about that, will you?

16:16.058 --> 16:17.434
Where are you going at this hour?

16:17.893 --> 16:19.019
To meet a friend.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.481
You're not getting
into trouble again lately, are you?

16:23.190 --> 16:24.942
Stop worrying.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.194
That brat.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.278
-Gosh.
-See you later.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.869
Why do you keep canceling?
You're embarrassing me.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.165
-I've been busy--
-Who doesn't know that?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.209
I'm not asking you to get married.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.919
I'm asking you to just meet her.

16:44.878 --> 16:46.714
Don't push him too much.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.717
He isn't interested
in getting married yet.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.802
He can meet people

16:51.969 --> 16:54.096
after Jeong-hun's wedding.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.557
I'm saying that
because she's a great catch.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.434
She's so smart.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.561
You'd fall in love with her too.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.938
I don't trust

17:03.355 --> 17:04.606
your judgment.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.235
Is there a woman

17:08.485 --> 17:10.154
you can't forget or something?

17:11.196 --> 17:12.656
That's silly.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.158
When it warms up,

17:14.533 --> 17:15.534
let's go golfing

17:16.118 --> 17:17.119
with Na-yoon.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.787
What days work for you? Saturday?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.330
Or Sunday?

17:20.581 --> 17:21.582
I quit golf.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.500
You should take Mom.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.588
You must be working really hard.

17:29.965 --> 17:30.966
I'm sorry, Dad.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.468
I don't think I'm emotionally ready

17:32.760 --> 17:34.470
to meet that man's daughter.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.472
Please push it back.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.456
Did you ask for me?

18:45.332 --> 18:46.583
Mr. Han! Fire!

18:58.929 --> 19:00.139
That was close.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.141
How did you end up causing a fire?

19:03.308 --> 19:05.102
The face is okay.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.104
Here.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.029
She must be the ex-girlfriend
from when you were studying abroad.

19:16.321 --> 19:17.698
Are you always so nosy?

19:18.365 --> 19:19.575
Stay out of my business.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.411
I'd like to,
but you told me all of the details

19:22.494 --> 19:23.871
even when I didn't want to know.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.622
You're always talking back.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.251
Did you talk to your kid?

19:29.626 --> 19:30.627
No, not yet.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.755
Then what? Will you let her meet
the social worker like this?

19:33.881 --> 19:36.842
How could a mom not control her kid?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.343
A kid is just like an adult.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.096
You can't control them
just because they're kids.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.681
There you go, lecturing me again.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.559
Then do something! Beat her or bribe her!

19:45.851 --> 19:47.352
I'm sorry,

19:47.811 --> 19:50.272
but you're the one who made this mess.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.941
Eun-seong needs time too.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.361
Her mom suddenly has a boyfriend,
and she suddenly got a dad.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.864
How could I tell her
to accept that overnight?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.286
Fine.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.414
I'll try to talk to her.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.640
All right.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.775
Eun-seong.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.861
Would you like an end piece?

20:39.738 --> 20:42.616
Come on.
You always go crazy for the end pieces.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.533
Here.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.036
I'm going to eat it then.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.287
I'm really eating it.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.001
It's so good.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.255
Eun-seong.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.216
I know you're happy.
Don't pretend you're not.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.636
I hate amusement parks. I'm not going.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.680
Don't be like that.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.225
You begged for me
to take you on my day off.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.643
I did not.

21:13.563 --> 21:16.275
Hi, Eun-seong. I'm a bear.

21:16.650 --> 21:20.404
Mom said she really wants to go
to the amusement park.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.656
Can't you go with her just once?

21:23.031 --> 21:25.659
Please? Eun-seong.

21:30.872 --> 21:31.873
Isn't it good?

21:31.999 --> 21:33.500
Tell me it's the best.

21:33.750 --> 21:34.584
Please?

21:35.043 --> 21:36.044
Pretty please?

21:37.087 --> 21:38.505
-Okay.
-Thank you.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.050
Hot water, please.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.053
The new menu...

21:45.304 --> 21:46.305
Gosh.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.931
It isn't doing very well.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.017
Hello.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.687
You're right.

21:55.063 --> 21:56.315
We should brainstorm new plans.

22:03.780 --> 22:06.533
Hye-su is taking Eun-seong

22:07.117 --> 22:08.285
to an amusement park.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.370
An amusement park?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.582
Shouldn't you tag along
and take some pictures?

22:13.832 --> 22:16.460
I thought you had to submit
more supporting documents.

22:20.088 --> 22:22.215
Things just keep getting tougher.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.468
The kid is no joke.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.762
What if she spills everything?

22:26.887 --> 22:28.096
What then?

22:29.139 --> 22:30.140
Spill what?

22:30.891 --> 22:31.892
What does she know?

22:31.975 --> 22:34.102
"He isn't close to my mom at all.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.563
I don't know that man."

22:37.022 --> 22:38.565
I'm worried she'd say things like that.

23:11.515 --> 23:14.267
Mom, I want to do that too.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.435
Okay. Hold on.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.689
-How pretty.
-Can you reach?

23:19.773 --> 23:20.899
-Well done.
-Look.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.526
-No, I can't reach.
-You can't?

23:33.995 --> 23:35.080
It eats so well.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.165
It likes it.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.042
Look at it eat.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.426
Eun-seong.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.595
Eun-seong.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.852
-It's simple, isn't it?
-I want to try.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.353
Isn't it so big?

23:58.436 --> 24:00.230
It's really big.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.233
-It's your favorite.
-You're right.

24:03.441 --> 24:05.944
These are the giraffes. Aren't they big?

24:06.153 --> 24:08.238
From birth, they are about 180cm tall.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.949
They grow to be about
as tall as a two-story building.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.951
That's about five to six meters...

24:13.076 --> 24:14.077
What are you looking at?

24:14.619 --> 24:15.620
What?

24:18.039 --> 24:19.040
Mom.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.333
Shall we feed him?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.628
-They love leaves.
-Oh my.

24:24.254 --> 24:26.173
He eats very well.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.175
Isn't he handsome?

24:28.258 --> 24:29.634
Why don't you try, sir?

24:30.135 --> 24:31.219
Here you go.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.727
That's right.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.228
Delicious.

24:52.282 --> 24:53.241
Eun-seong.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.702
Do you want to have lunch?
I'll buy you something yummy.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.664
What's that? Is that gimbap?

25:01.166 --> 25:03.293
I love gimbap.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.213
-Want some gimbap?
-Let's eat gimbap.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.256
Let's eat gimbap.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.800
I'm hungry. Sit down.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.304
There you go.

25:16.306 --> 25:18.475
Should we take a picture before we eat?

25:19.601 --> 25:20.602
Okay.

25:21.478 --> 25:23.438
Okay. Cheese.

25:23.563 --> 25:24.814
Smile.

25:25.774 --> 25:26.733
Eun-seong.

25:26.983 --> 25:28.693
Did you invite him?

25:32.781 --> 25:35.116
No, but I...

25:35.825 --> 25:36.826
Eun-seong.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.912
-Eun-seong.
-Wait a second.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.164
Why did you come here?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.333
Stop arguing with me.
I don't like it either.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.797
Stay here. I'll get her.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.029
Eun-seong.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.868
Here. Do you want ice cream?

26:19.077 --> 26:20.078
Ice cream.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.496
Do you want ice cream?

26:21.746 --> 26:23.331
I love ice cream.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.168
Here.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.629
It's yummy.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.298
Come on.

26:31.798 --> 26:34.009
Your dad's arms are getting tired.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.220
It's ice cream, Eun-seong.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.180
Eun-seong.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.141
Help!

26:41.266 --> 26:42.809
-Help!
-Eun-seong.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.352
-Eun-seong.
-Eun-seong.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.022
Mom.

26:48.023 --> 26:49.024
Eun-seong.

26:49.649 --> 26:51.526
-Mom.
-Yes?

26:51.651 --> 26:52.610
Don't go.

26:52.694 --> 26:54.863
You can't go to this man.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.407
Eun-seong, ice cream.

26:58.533 --> 27:00.744
Go. Get away. She's my mom!

27:01.536 --> 27:03.121
Today won't work. You should go.

27:03.997 --> 27:05.999
Mom, don't go.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.001
Stop being like this.
You can't act this way.

27:10.837 --> 27:12.797
Mom, don't go.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.091
You can't leave me.

27:17.010 --> 27:19.512
Why would I leave you?

27:21.890 --> 27:23.850
-Let's go.
-I hate him.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.810
I hate that man so much.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.273
Don't be like that.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.445
Why would I leave you?

27:36.988 --> 27:37.989
Don't cry.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.824
I'm sorry, so don't cry.

27:41.034 --> 27:42.077
Let's go home.

27:42.786 --> 27:43.787
Let's go.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.874
I'm leaving.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.837
Listen to your dad

28:34.879 --> 28:36.798
and don't fight with your brother.

28:41.886 --> 28:42.887
Ji-hun,

28:44.013 --> 28:45.348
I'm leaving now.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.188
I'm leaving.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.152
Ji-hun.

29:17.630 --> 29:21.259
How could a mom leave her child
and not call even once?

29:23.094 --> 29:24.804
He eats junk food all day

29:25.138 --> 29:26.723
and sleeps anywhere.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.143
She hasn't taught him anything basic.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.105
Where do I even begin to change him?

29:46.242 --> 29:48.661
HAN SEONG-GUK

30:35.834 --> 30:37.585
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

30:37.669 --> 30:39.379
-Oh my.
-What happened?

30:39.754 --> 30:41.589
She slit her wrist in the bathtub.

30:41.673 --> 30:42.966
-What?
-Why?

30:43.049 --> 30:44.884
She was probably caught
for being a mistress.

30:45.009 --> 30:46.302
She's a mistress?

30:46.427 --> 30:48.221
She wasn't a widow with a kid?

30:48.304 --> 30:51.850
You didn't know?
She already sent the kid to the father.

30:58.356 --> 30:59.524
Mom!

30:59.816 --> 31:01.442
Mom!

31:02.277 --> 31:04.779
Mom!

31:47.864 --> 31:48.865
Eun-seong.

31:50.992 --> 31:54.287
That man and I aren't allowed
to like each other?

31:54.370 --> 31:55.747
Yes, you aren't.

32:29.697 --> 32:33.076
Gosh, you can't starve like this.

32:34.911 --> 32:37.413
You need your energy to get your surgery.

32:38.998 --> 32:40.333
What a waste.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.380
You must be so happy.

32:46.005 --> 32:48.174
It's hard to find a daughter-in-law
like that these days.

33:17.954 --> 33:18.830
Hello?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.457
What's wrong with your voice?

33:22.208 --> 33:23.209
Are you sick?

33:25.628 --> 33:27.046
I have a cold.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.007
What is it?

33:29.757 --> 33:31.259
Talk to Ji-hun.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.386
He refuses to get married.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.597
He canceled several blind dates
I arranged for him.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.433
I think

33:38.808 --> 33:40.184
it's because of you,

33:40.685 --> 33:41.894
so you need to get involved.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.565
Why is that because of me?

33:45.982 --> 33:47.567
It's probably his Achilles' heel

33:47.650 --> 33:49.402
that his mom is not my wife.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.821
He must be ashamed.

33:52.488 --> 33:54.907
That's why he won't date or get married.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.785
You're the only one
who can do something about it.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.621
Talk to him and convince him

34:01.164 --> 34:02.165
to get married.

34:02.749 --> 34:04.333
It's too good an opportunity to pass up.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.544
Why are you telling me to convince him?

34:06.961 --> 34:08.588
That's your family's problem.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.383
Don't tell me what to do.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.553
If his own father can't convince him,

34:15.845 --> 34:17.180
how could I...

34:22.643 --> 34:23.895
I have a bad cold.

34:24.437 --> 34:25.772
I can't talk long.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.107
Goodbye.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.456
Eun-seong.

34:44.457 --> 34:47.376
I have something to say.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.128
No. I won't listen.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.089
You want to talk about that man again.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.633
Wrong. That's not it.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.010
Come and fold this.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.471
You're all grown up now.
You're a young lady.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.348
You should start folding your clothes.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.935
Gosh, I'm so tired.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.520
When will I ever finish?

35:05.770 --> 35:08.815
I wish you'd help me with this one.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.859
It would help so much
if you'd fold just this one.

35:13.903 --> 35:14.904
Will you help?

35:15.738 --> 35:17.073
Good girl.

35:18.658 --> 35:19.659
Thank you.

35:21.494 --> 35:22.411
Here.

35:24.247 --> 35:25.581
Fold it the way I do.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.173
Gosh, you're a professional.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.383
You're better than me.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.802
I can do everything.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.055
Fine. Then try the pants.

35:41.722 --> 35:42.723
Fold it however you want.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.561
You need to know how to do everything

35:46.686 --> 35:49.105
even if I'm not around anymore.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.524
You need to know how to fold laundry,

35:51.607 --> 35:53.401
set the table for yourself,

35:53.776 --> 35:55.862
and get dressed by yourself.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.656
You need to know
how to do all of that, okay?

35:59.198 --> 36:00.032
Why?

36:00.908 --> 36:02.577
Because you want to get married?

36:03.244 --> 36:04.370
What?

36:04.579 --> 36:06.664
You're going to marry that man

36:07.081 --> 36:08.541
and go far, far away?

36:09.542 --> 36:11.085
That's what Auntie Ju-yeon said.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.922
She said if you leave me
and go far, far away,

36:15.506 --> 36:17.383
I'll have to live with her.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.304
She was just teasing you.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.890
Why would I go far away without you?

36:24.599 --> 36:25.558
My goodness.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.396
That's not what I meant when I said you
need to know how to do things on your own.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.899
It's because I'm busy.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.819
So you should do things
that you can do on your own.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.948
We can't live together forever.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.743
I'm super old,

36:43.910 --> 36:46.454
so I can't live forever.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.998
-That's why--
-That's why what?

36:49.457 --> 36:52.376
That's why you should learn one by one.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.171
Brush your teeth by yourself,

36:55.254 --> 36:56.881
eat by yourself,

36:56.964 --> 36:58.507
and shower by yourself.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.134
Do everything by yourself.

37:00.676 --> 37:01.552
Okay?

37:02.637 --> 37:03.638
What about marriage?

37:05.181 --> 37:06.349
You won't do it, right?

37:07.600 --> 37:08.935
You won't, right?

37:09.602 --> 37:10.603
Right?

37:28.871 --> 37:30.957
HOW TO WIN OVER A KID

37:35.086 --> 37:37.255
HOW DO I WIN A KID OVER?
HOW TO CONNECT WITH KIDS

37:46.013 --> 37:48.224
"Listening to and relating to

37:48.349 --> 37:51.185
what the child says is the first step
to communication..."

37:54.188 --> 37:55.648
That's so obvious.

37:56.524 --> 37:57.650
Everyone knows that.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.991
"Above all else,

38:05.783 --> 38:08.869
spend a lot of time with the child."

38:24.677 --> 38:25.678
What is that?

38:26.220 --> 38:28.514
It's supposed to rain tomorrow,

38:28.639 --> 38:30.099
so I'm bringing the bike in.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.351
She can ride a bike?

38:33.019 --> 38:35.271
We got it from our old landlady.

38:35.354 --> 38:36.772
She's learning little by little.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.733
Tell her to come out.

38:38.941 --> 38:40.359
I'll teach her how to ride.

38:42.486 --> 38:44.113
At this hour? She's sleeping.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.698
This is no time for sleep.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.370
They said she needs to spend
as much time with me as possible.

38:52.246 --> 38:53.247
Who did?

38:54.373 --> 38:55.333
Well...

38:55.458 --> 38:56.584
Somebody.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.628
Remember what happened this afternoon?

39:00.504 --> 39:02.715
You should avoid
spending time together right now.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.842
She hates you already.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.636
Am I doing this for myself?

39:08.095 --> 39:09.513
That's not what I mean.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.975
I'm saying we can't force it.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.602
You said you'd convince her.

39:14.769 --> 39:15.811
What will you do?

39:15.895 --> 39:17.438
You don't care if it ends here?

39:17.563 --> 39:18.773
You'll pay back all the money?

39:19.732 --> 39:20.733
What?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.569
I'm frustrated too.

39:23.652 --> 39:25.237
I'm going crazy because I have no choice.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.908
A person's life is at stake.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.035
Get your head on straight.

40:06.821 --> 40:09.949
THINGS A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL LIKES

40:30.636 --> 40:33.055
RION ART HALL

40:50.781 --> 40:51.782
When did you come?

40:52.366 --> 40:54.785
Why don't you answer your phone?

40:54.869 --> 40:56.579
I keep my phone off during practice.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.248
It's not like you practice day and night.

40:59.915 --> 41:01.792
I couldn't reach you at all.
That isn't right.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.919
I don't contact anyone before a recital.

41:04.044 --> 41:05.296
I want to focus.

41:07.381 --> 41:08.716
I need to finish practicing.

41:09.091 --> 41:11.469
-I'll call you later.
-Hold on.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.054
Don't you even have time for tea?

41:16.015 --> 41:17.516
We set our engagement date.

41:18.726 --> 41:19.727
You heard, right?

41:21.604 --> 41:22.605
Jeong-hun.

41:22.813 --> 41:23.772
What?

41:25.983 --> 41:27.276
Why don't we take a break

41:28.152 --> 41:29.403
from seeing each other?

41:31.322 --> 41:32.865
Let's push back the engagement too.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.701
-Let's start over.
-What do you mean?

41:36.494 --> 41:37.495
What?

41:39.205 --> 41:40.664
Did you have a change of heart?

41:43.042 --> 41:44.585
Is there someone

41:46.045 --> 41:47.379
that you like?

41:47.463 --> 41:48.464
Yes.

41:49.965 --> 41:50.966
I'm sorry.

41:51.383 --> 41:53.010
I'll talk to my parents.

42:08.567 --> 42:09.777
Have you lost your mind?

42:10.152 --> 42:12.821
How could you do this
if you were right in the head?

42:13.155 --> 42:14.281
Sorry, Ju-yeon.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.911
I thought I just had to get surgery.

42:19.662 --> 42:21.539
I didn't know I'd need a witness.

42:22.289 --> 42:25.167
I have no siblings or family.

42:26.293 --> 42:27.878
You're the only one who can help me.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.130
So you're asking me to say,

42:31.090 --> 42:33.133
"Yes, my friend

42:33.592 --> 42:36.220
was dating that man.

42:36.845 --> 42:40.057
So take my friend's liver
and give it to his mom." Is that it?

42:40.266 --> 42:42.184
-Ju-yeon.
-I can't do that.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.727
Not a chance.

42:45.062 --> 42:47.439
Do you even know what you're doing?

42:47.565 --> 42:48.691
You're selling your liver.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.818
What will you sell next
if you run out of money?

42:50.943 --> 42:52.152
Why not sell your kidney too?

42:52.570 --> 42:55.030
What's the need for two of them?

43:02.955 --> 43:04.665
I know it's not right--

43:04.748 --> 43:06.041
Then how could you do this?

43:08.294 --> 43:09.295
Hye-su.

43:09.795 --> 43:11.088
I know

43:11.547 --> 43:13.090
things are tough,

43:14.341 --> 43:16.635
but you're not the only one struggling
with money.

43:17.136 --> 43:19.054
Other people don't do this!

43:19.638 --> 43:20.931
Hye-su,

43:21.348 --> 43:23.642
I thought you were smart.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.061
I guess I was wrong. Sorry.

43:26.186 --> 43:27.688
I can't do this.

43:27.813 --> 43:29.189
It's not that I won't.

43:29.315 --> 43:30.524
I can't.

43:30.649 --> 43:31.650
Why?

43:31.734 --> 43:34.820
It's because I feel like I no longer
know who you really are.

43:35.029 --> 43:35.946
Sorry.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.156
Hold on.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.452
You'll end up in prison if you get caught.

43:42.036 --> 43:43.287
You'll be behind bars.

43:43.996 --> 43:46.582
What happens to Eun-seong then?

43:47.082 --> 43:49.126
You'll leave that poor thing all alone!

43:50.919 --> 43:52.046
That's why...

43:53.339 --> 43:55.382
That's why I can't leave things like this.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.512
I did everything I could until now.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.226
I struggled every day for seven years
while raising Eun-seong,

44:06.810 --> 44:08.354
but nothing changed for the better.

44:08.437 --> 44:09.563
No.

44:12.232 --> 44:13.567
Instead of getting better,

44:15.694 --> 44:17.029
things just got worse.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.996
I'm doing this to protect her.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.625
I can do anything to protect her.

44:31.126 --> 44:32.336
Not just my liver,

44:33.420 --> 44:35.297
but I could sell my heart too.

44:37.966 --> 44:38.967
Ju-yeon.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.305
You can curse me if you want.

44:44.223 --> 44:45.683
You can hit me.

44:46.809 --> 44:47.810
Please.

44:49.436 --> 44:51.855
You're the only one I can ask.

44:54.066 --> 44:55.734
You've really lost your mind.

44:56.693 --> 44:58.821
You've really gone crazy.

44:59.613 --> 45:00.572
Seriously?

45:06.286 --> 45:08.122
What do I do with you?

45:36.984 --> 45:39.194
Ms. Oh, are you going somewhere?

45:39.653 --> 45:42.030
Yes. I want to go out for a bit.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.117
No way.
You can't go anywhere in your state.

45:45.242 --> 45:46.243
I'm fine.

45:46.618 --> 45:49.329
I'll take a short walk nearby as exercise.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.331
Don't tell anyone at the hospital.

45:51.707 --> 45:52.749
I'll be right back.

45:52.833 --> 45:53.834
But...

45:54.835 --> 45:55.878
Ms. Oh.

46:04.011 --> 46:05.012
Have a nice day.

46:08.223 --> 46:12.060
Goodness. The spring rain is falling hard.

46:17.566 --> 46:18.984
Oh my. Ms. Oh.

46:19.234 --> 46:20.652
What brings you--

46:20.736 --> 46:21.987
Is Ji-hun in?

46:23.197 --> 46:24.072
Pardon?

46:24.698 --> 46:27.451
Wait. Did you tell the hospital?

46:27.534 --> 46:29.411
Can you be out like this?

46:29.536 --> 46:31.788
Did Ji-hun not come today?

46:31.997 --> 46:33.290
-Hye-su.
-Well...

46:33.373 --> 46:35.083
The thing is...

46:35.876 --> 46:37.294
He's at the head office.

46:37.377 --> 46:38.545
He didn't come today.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.007
Is there something urgent?

46:42.132 --> 46:45.385
You can't overexert yourself like this.
My goodness.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.470
You...

46:51.558 --> 46:53.268
You work here?

46:57.606 --> 46:58.607
My goodness.

46:59.149 --> 47:00.692
She's an employee here?

47:01.485 --> 47:02.736
We need to talk.

47:03.278 --> 47:04.404
Yes, Ms. Oh.

47:11.286 --> 47:14.540
Your life really is a mess, isn't it?

47:15.415 --> 47:17.334
I don't know what your situation is,

47:18.001 --> 47:20.003
but how did it come to this?

47:23.382 --> 47:25.008
I'm glad I saw you today.

47:26.301 --> 47:27.844
Let's go.

47:28.053 --> 47:29.054
Where?

47:29.555 --> 47:30.931
To meet with an attorney.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.182
Sorry?

47:32.349 --> 47:34.643
Let's get the marriage annulled.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.812
-Ms. Oh.
-Go change.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.610
It hasn't even been that long
since you registered the marriage.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.612
I'm sure there's a way.

47:46.321 --> 47:48.490
I'll talk to Mr. Han first.

47:48.615 --> 47:50.576
There's nothing to talk to him about!

47:51.827 --> 47:53.245
Just come with me.

47:53.328 --> 47:54.329
Wait.

47:54.413 --> 47:56.123
Take a breather.

47:56.248 --> 47:58.792
Breathe a little first, and talk slowly.

47:59.585 --> 48:02.212
Hye-su, go upstairs
and make her some honey tea.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.297
Quickly.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.924
Look at you, you're all wet.

48:06.049 --> 48:08.594
You'll catch a cold like this. Goodness.

48:09.011 --> 48:10.846
Towel...

48:20.397 --> 48:22.858
Do you know Mr. Han's mom?

48:23.859 --> 48:25.235
Yes, a little.

48:25.319 --> 48:26.903
You know a lot of people.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.532
You're close to Seung-ju too.

48:31.658 --> 48:33.285
You're well-connected, aren't you?

48:34.703 --> 48:36.455
-The person you are trying to reach...
-My gosh.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.749
Why won't this punk pick up?

48:39.541 --> 48:40.667
Why are you here?

48:41.835 --> 48:42.836
The tea.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.088
Is the tea ready?

48:45.172 --> 48:46.173
Yes. Here.

48:46.882 --> 48:48.967
I'm losing my mind.

48:49.593 --> 48:50.594
Darn it.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.019
Where did she go?

48:59.478 --> 49:01.271
She just left.

49:02.564 --> 49:03.565
What?

49:04.107 --> 49:05.150
Gosh.

49:09.863 --> 49:11.823
Where did she go?

49:12.324 --> 49:13.825
Go inside. I'll look for her.

49:13.950 --> 49:14.993
No, I'll look for her.

49:15.077 --> 49:16.078
What?

49:16.828 --> 49:17.829
Gosh.

49:21.917 --> 49:23.710
Why isn't he answering?

50:01.748 --> 50:03.834
This is the transplantation center
at Seungjin Hospital.

50:04.126 --> 50:06.503
I've been trying to reach you
for the follow-up interview,

50:06.628 --> 50:09.131
but I haven't heard back from you.
Please give us a call.

50:15.804 --> 50:17.472
Hi, Ho-jun. What's up?

50:17.973 --> 50:19.099
We're in trouble.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.226
Why?

50:28.400 --> 50:30.652
-Have you heard from her?
-Is she ignoring your calls too?

50:32.487 --> 50:33.530
Call the police.

50:33.655 --> 50:34.656
Okay.

50:35.115 --> 50:36.575
Hey, take this umbrella.

50:55.635 --> 50:56.636
No!

50:57.846 --> 50:59.181
Let go.

50:59.723 --> 51:00.724
Don't do this.

51:01.016 --> 51:02.309
Let go, please.

51:02.392 --> 51:04.269
Let me die. I don't want to live.

51:04.394 --> 51:05.479
Don't do this.

51:05.562 --> 51:06.646
Let go!

51:07.647 --> 51:10.317
I've done only horrible things to my son.

51:11.234 --> 51:13.361
I don't want to harm my son anymore.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.990
I can't do this anymore. Let go.

51:17.115 --> 51:18.992
No, you have to live.

51:19.075 --> 51:21.369
Let go! Who are you to say anything?

51:24.080 --> 51:25.081
Ms. Oh!

51:25.707 --> 51:26.708
Ms. Oh!

51:31.087 --> 51:32.088
Ms. Oh!

51:32.547 --> 51:33.548
Ms. Oh.

51:33.882 --> 51:35.133
Are you okay?

51:35.342 --> 51:36.343
-Are you okay?
-Let go.

51:37.302 --> 51:38.303
Ms. Oh!

51:38.386 --> 51:39.387
Ms. Oh!

51:39.471 --> 51:40.972
Let go of me. Let go!

51:41.598 --> 51:42.599
Ms. Oh!

51:43.850 --> 51:44.810
-Let go!
-Ms. Oh.

51:44.976 --> 51:45.977
Let go. Please.

51:46.102 --> 51:47.229
Then go with me.

51:47.813 --> 51:48.855
I'll die with you.

51:52.400 --> 51:54.194
If you die, I die.

51:54.820 --> 51:55.821
If you die,

51:56.530 --> 51:57.823
I'll die too.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.660
You need to live for me to live.

52:09.376 --> 52:10.961
I want to live like crazy.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.422
I really want to live like crazy.

52:16.174 --> 52:17.384
Ms. Oh, please...

52:18.301 --> 52:19.469
We should both live.

52:21.638 --> 52:23.640
Living is still better, isn't it?

52:25.183 --> 52:27.519
Even if it's a pathetic life,
living is still better.

52:34.067 --> 52:35.068
Ms. Oh.

52:39.531 --> 52:41.116
Ms. Oh, I'm begging you.

52:52.210 --> 52:53.587
Please, Ms. Oh.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.721
Ms. Oh.

53:14.941 --> 53:15.942
Ms. Oh.

53:16.276 --> 53:17.360
Ms. Oh, please.

53:25.744 --> 53:28.163
I'm begging you, Ms. Oh.

53:34.377 --> 53:36.796
My goodness.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.673
I told you not to go out.

53:38.798 --> 53:39.883
Gosh.

53:41.927 --> 53:43.094
Please get the doctor.

53:44.012 --> 53:45.013
Okay.

53:52.187 --> 53:53.188
Please leave.

53:54.689 --> 53:55.899
I want to be alone.

54:00.695 --> 54:01.821
Leave.

55:16.229 --> 55:17.230
How is...

55:29.451 --> 55:30.660
I'll go now.

55:31.578 --> 55:33.663
I'm late to pick up Eun-seong.

55:35.123 --> 55:36.249
Wait.

55:47.093 --> 55:48.094
Put this on.

55:50.680 --> 55:52.015
I'm fine.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.100
Look after your mother.

56:00.565 --> 56:01.566
Hye-su.

56:22.712 --> 56:23.713
Get in.

56:30.136 --> 56:31.137
Just get in.

57:11.219 --> 57:13.763
If you catch a cold,
you can't get the surgery.

57:28.236 --> 57:29.446
Where's the day care center?

57:30.822 --> 57:31.823
It's okay.

57:32.240 --> 57:33.575
Drop me off near home.

57:33.825 --> 57:34.951
You said you're...

57:39.497 --> 57:40.665
You said you're late.

57:45.128 --> 57:46.880
I'll take care of what's going on
with Eun-seong.

57:48.047 --> 57:50.717
If she hates me that much,
let's look for another way.

58:12.280 --> 58:14.365
RECENT CALLS

58:16.659 --> 58:18.286
HAN JI-HUN

58:58.034 --> 58:59.160
Found it.

59:11.839 --> 59:13.675
Eun-seong, you must be hungry.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.093
Let's eat.

59:19.681 --> 59:20.932
What do you...

59:21.683 --> 59:22.934
Where are you going?

59:23.393 --> 59:24.519
The playground.

59:24.686 --> 59:25.687
The playground?

59:25.937 --> 59:26.938
Alone?

59:27.146 --> 59:28.648
Don't follow me there.

59:28.731 --> 59:30.108
I can go alone.

59:31.192 --> 59:32.694
You told me to do everything on my own.

59:33.319 --> 59:34.445
Eun-seong.

1:00:14.736 --> 1:00:15.862
What are you doing?

1:00:18.573 --> 1:00:19.574
Where are you going?

1:00:20.033 --> 1:00:21.951
Go away. Don't follow me.

1:00:22.910 --> 1:00:24.162
I'm not following you.

1:00:24.245 --> 1:00:25.705
I'm just going in the same direction.

1:00:25.955 --> 1:00:27.874
You go your way, and I'll go mine.

1:00:28.958 --> 1:00:30.585
I hate you.

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:32.962
I hate you.

1:00:33.504 --> 1:00:34.631
I know.

1:00:34.839 --> 1:00:36.090
You can't have my mom.

1:00:36.883 --> 1:00:37.884
I know that too.

1:00:38.134 --> 1:00:39.427
My mom said

1:00:39.719 --> 1:00:42.680
that she loves only me and my dad.

1:00:43.973 --> 1:00:46.142
My dad and I are all she has.

1:00:47.060 --> 1:00:48.061
Hey,

1:00:48.144 --> 1:00:49.604
love changes.

1:00:49.812 --> 1:00:51.022
It does not.

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:53.858
Eun-seong.

1:00:54.067 --> 1:00:55.068
Eun-seong!

1:00:55.234 --> 1:00:56.235
Ji-hun.

1:01:43.908 --> 1:01:45.284
Do you always stay this late?

1:01:45.368 --> 1:01:46.994
I have lots of problems too.

1:01:47.078 --> 1:01:48.746
Do you love my mom?

1:01:48.871 --> 1:01:51.457
Then you can't leave
like my dad did, okay?

1:01:51.624 --> 1:01:54.168
Ji-hun, do you no longer have
feelings for me?

1:01:54.585 --> 1:01:56.295
Can't we start over?

1:01:56.421 --> 1:01:57.755
Sorry for not introducing you sooner.

1:01:57.839 --> 1:01:59.424
This is my girlfriend, Kang Hye-su.

1:01:59.590 --> 1:02:00.717
We're engaged.

1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:02.427
Don't do anything you'll regret.

1:02:02.510 --> 1:02:05.138
Everything depends on that one moment.

1:02:05.263 --> 1:02:06.889
Why do you live so foolishly?

1:02:06.973 --> 1:02:08.433
He was a good person.

1:02:08.516 --> 1:02:10.309
He always gave everything to me.

1:02:10.435 --> 1:02:11.519
I'll divorce you quickly,

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:13.229
so meet a good guy next time.

1:02:13.354 --> 1:02:14.355
Okay?

1:02:16.983 --> 1:02:18.943
