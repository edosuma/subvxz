18:46.292 --> 18:49.693
Hey, y-you just can't say it,
can you --

18:49.728 --> 18:53.130
because you think that'll make
you look like a horrible person?

18:53.165 --> 18:55.699
Vanessa,
is it possible

18:55.734 --> 18:57.368
that<i> you're</i> a little mad
at Carol for going away?

18:57.403 --> 18:59.870
No.
No, no, no, no.

18:59.905 --> 19:01.372
Yes.
- Yes!

19:04.677 --> 19:06.710
Does that make me
a horrible person?

19:06.745 --> 19:08.979
No.
She's your friend.

19:09.014 --> 19:10.214
[ Sighs ]

19:10.249 --> 19:11.849
Yeah, and I should be happy
for her.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.450
It's okay.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.154
You're not really
mad at her.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.889
You just...

19:18.924 --> 19:20.191
miss her.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.996
I miss her, too.

19:29.935 --> 19:34.171
Listen, if you want to
get together every now and then

19:34.206 --> 19:37.474
and talk Brontes,
we can...

19:37.509 --> 19:41.345
for a small amount
of that time...

19:41.380 --> 19:44.215
talk about
your feelings.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.418
Thank you.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.019
Yeah.
- Thanks. Thanks.

19:49.054 --> 19:50.588
You know, Chuck...

19:50.623 --> 19:54.392
you were supposed to be
a lovely career woman like me.

19:55.894 --> 19:58.429
"Life is so constructed
that the event does not,

19:58.464 --> 20:03.467
will not, cannot
match the expectation."

20:05.104 --> 20:06.237
[ Door closes ]

20:06.272 --> 20:08.973
Freakin' love that one.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.881
Hey. Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man

20:17.916 --> 20:21.018
with the winner of
- the 500th vlog contest, Wayne --

20:21.053 --> 20:22.653
Don't use my name.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.259
...here with a few words
about our national parks.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.728
So listen carefully...

20:30.763 --> 20:34.131
especially to the words
he's<i> not</i> saying.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.138
Our national parks
are national treasures.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.207
They're home
to majestic mountains,

20:43.242 --> 20:44.742
breathtaking waterfalls --

20:44.777 --> 20:48.346
Filled with fluoride
pumped in by the government.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.318
Have you ever seen
a beaver's teeth?

20:54.353 --> 20:57.488
Beautiful, clean,
no cavities, great smile.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.924
And contrary to popular belief,
hunting is allowed

21:00.959 --> 21:04.628
in many national parks
for population control.

21:04.663 --> 21:07.598
Speaking of
population control,

21:07.633 --> 21:12.203
why does the government put
"sriracha sauce" on everything?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.144
So, in quick closing...

21:20.179 --> 21:23.981
visit your parks,
and that's our 500th

21:24.016 --> 21:27.718
and [Chuckles] quite possibly
our final vlog.
