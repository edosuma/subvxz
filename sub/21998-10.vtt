violates her parole,

- You're making a mistake here.
- Sorry. Have you ever made

09:16.719 --> 09:17.871
a bad call, Linda?

09:20.832 --> 09:22.824
You ever returned a kid to a situation

09:22.859 --> 09:24.526
that they never should have returned to?

09:26.224 --> 09:28.621

at two different schools,
