(man)
In the criminal justice system,
sexually based offenses

00:09.843 --> 00:12.180
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.582
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.582 --> 00:16.950
who investigate these vicious
felonies are members

00:16.950 --> 00:19.953
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.989
These are their stories.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.525
Welcome.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.460
Well, this must be
little man Noah.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.463
Hi.
How is everybody today?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.599
Good, we just woke up.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.866
Okay.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.468
Big first day.
You ready, sweetie?

00:34.468 --> 00:36.003
So should I--should I
stay a while?

00:36.003 --> 00:37.671
Well, you can,
but we usually

00:37.671 --> 00:40.208
recommend a quick
and loving good-bye.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.111
Okay.
Okay, okay.

00:43.111 --> 00:47.181
So.
Big first day.

00:47.181 --> 00:49.183
You're okay, baby.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.051
Mwah.
Love you.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.986
You know, Mom, it's probably
harder on the parents

00:52.986 --> 00:55.022
than the kids.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.860
- Okay.
- All right.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.663
Have fun, Noah.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.734
- Say "Bye bye, Mom."
- Have fun.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.870
No, no, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.972
Shh, come here.
Come here.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.143
Come on.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.610
Mom, we got to go.

01:16.610 --> 01:17.611
Where's the change
for the penny harvest?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.580
- Today's the last day.
- Today?

01:19.580 --> 01:24.818
Ugh.
The jar is...

01:24.818 --> 01:26.187
somewhere.

01:26.187 --> 01:27.855
I told you about it,
like, four times.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.989
We're gonna be late now.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.259
I'll bring it
by school later.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.162
Don't worry,
I won't forget.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.169
You're really gonna walk
to school like that?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.370
I thought you didn't
want to be late.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.172
Come on, let's go.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.373
Oh, look, Owen.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.341
It's Bennett.
Hi, Bennett!

01:47.341 --> 01:48.542
Hey, Roy.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.978
Would you mind taking Owen
with you?

01:50.978 --> 01:52.946
I'm not exactly camera ready.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.515
No problem.

01:54.515 --> 01:55.649
You're picking me up,
right Mom?

01:55.649 --> 01:58.686
I am, I promise.
Love you!

01:59.687 --> 02:03.424
[car horn blares]

02:03.424 --> 02:05.593
Thanks.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.695
Hey, Owen.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.463
My dad took me to get
these sneakers.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.765
Last time we went,
which was like a few months ago,

02:11.765 --> 02:13.234
I was a size 4 1/2 .

02:13.234 --> 02:14.768
This time, I was a 5.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.069
A 5?

02:16.069 --> 02:17.771
What are you, in the NBA
or something?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.240
(man)
See, these are the pillars
that we need.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.241
- Hey, Clyde.
- I know, it's going--

02:20.241 --> 02:22.310
Owen, my man.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.213
Make sure you learn something
in school today.

02:25.213 --> 02:28.749
- I always do.
- Well, all right.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.218
See, people
always playing games.

02:30.218 --> 02:32.286
You've got to understand
what's going on.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.622
These are the benefits and
the pillars of the community--

02:37.325 --> 02:38.792
Tucker.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.961
To what do I owe the pleasure?

02:40.961 --> 02:43.331
What, I can't just pop in?

02:43.331 --> 02:45.098
No.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.667
What's going on?

02:46.667 --> 02:50.738
Well, I was sniffing
around 1PP this morning,

02:50.738 --> 02:55.843
and the scuttlebutt is
they want a lieutenant in here.

02:55.843 --> 03:01.815
They're not happy with
a sergeant running the squad.

03:01.815 --> 03:06.987
Last I checked,
I was doing a pretty good job.

03:06.987 --> 03:10.023
We busted Johnny D's
sex trafficking ring.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.660
We took down Yates
after Chicago botched it.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.262
And they've noticed.

03:14.262 --> 03:17.097
They're open to the prospect
of you staying on.

03:17.097 --> 03:18.366
That's why I told them
you already filed

03:18.366 --> 03:21.902
for the Lieutenant's exam.

03:21.902 --> 03:22.936
I haven't.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.505
Then do it.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.874
Don't make a liar
out of me.

03:26.874 --> 03:30.378
I'm quite happy with the way
things are, thank you.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.580
They want a lieutenant.

03:32.580 --> 03:38.051
If it's not you,
it's gonna be somebody else.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.921
I don't know what to say.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.557
That's a first.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.426
Think about it.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.596
Also think about
who your second whip would be.

03:48.596 --> 03:51.299
Better you pick
than a blind draw.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.707
You need to sign this.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.809
Julian, Marco, that's enough.

04:01.809 --> 04:05.012
Give Jonathan his hat back.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.047
Who--who are--who are you
here for?

04:07.047 --> 04:08.716
Owen Farhidi.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.518
Mr. Farhidi, he call.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.520
Uh, yes, he did.
Carlos, right?

04:12.520 --> 04:14.422
- Um hm.
- Owen's right over there.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.729
Owen?

04:21.729 --> 04:23.797
I am Fabiana's friend.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.800
Your mother tell me
to pick you up.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.636
I fixed the sink once.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.903
Oh, okay.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.405
Okay?

04:33.073 --> 04:36.076
Here, give me
your hand, okay?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.582
Hope I'll be in cabin
eight this summer,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.250
which will be good, cause--

04:43.250 --> 04:45.185
Hey, home is this way.

04:45.185 --> 04:47.655
We're gonna stop first, huh?
A surprise.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.523
Oh, okay.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.735
Hey, sorry I'm late.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.105
Where is Owen?

05:06.974 --> 05:09.176
- Where are we going?
- Do as I say.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.144
I don't--you're hurting me.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.113
Be quiet.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.615
- Get in right now.
- I don't want to get in.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.385
- I said in.
- Aah!

05:17.385 --> 05:20.521
Owen?

05:20.521 --> 05:23.156
Owen?
- Owen seemed to know the man.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.592
Have you seen Owen?

05:24.592 --> 05:27.194
Owen Farhidi.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.764
Owen?

05:30.764 --> 05:34.167
Owen?

05:36.404 --> 05:39.407
[dramatic music]

06:22.483 --> 06:22.616
.

06:23.350 --> 06:23.751
So what do we got?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.353
- The boy is still missing?
- Owen Farhidi, eight.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.188
Last seen 40 minutes ago

06:28.188 --> 06:30.524
heading south with a male
Hispanic, 5'8", medium build.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.825
No one got
a great look at him.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.527
He wrote Carlos Riva
on the sign-out sheet.

06:33.527 --> 06:34.895
Said that he was
a friend of the family.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.163
Sergeant,
I'm Principal Stanwick.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.698
Mrs. Farhidi
is in the office.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.667
This is Mrs. Dugan,
our dismissal supervisor.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.901
She's the one
that signed Owen out.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.636
To a stranger?

06:42.636 --> 06:44.371
We thought Mr. Farhidi called
to authorize a family friend

06:44.371 --> 06:45.739
to take Owen.
- But he didn't.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.508
We contacted him
after Mrs. Farhidi

06:47.508 --> 06:49.142
arrived late
to pick Owen up.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.844
He insisted he did not
make the call.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.314
You should know
they're recently divorced.

06:54.314 --> 06:56.817
I don't have other people
pick up Owen that often.

06:56.817 --> 07:00.320
Usually it's Fabiana,
our nanny, or a friend's nanny.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.490
You sure that you didn't call
anybody today, Mrs. Farhidi?

07:02.490 --> 07:03.991
- I'm positive.
- Well, sometimes people forget.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.559
Let's just look
at your phone.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.561
Maybe there's something
in your call log.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.330
I can't find my phone!

07:10.330 --> 07:11.799
Okay, do you remember
where you were

07:11.799 --> 07:13.100
the last time you used it?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.835
I mean, it must have been
before yoga.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.606
I get so spaced out afterwards,
sometimes I just leave it there.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.073
And how long have you
been separated?

07:20.073 --> 07:22.142
It's been official
a few months now.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.744
Are there any
custody issues?

07:23.744 --> 07:26.146
Yes, huge.
Sam is Iranian.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.248
He wanted to take Owen there
over spring break.

07:28.248 --> 07:31.519
I wouldn't let him.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.687
Oh, no, you don't think
that Sam maybe

07:33.687 --> 07:34.688
got someone from
the restaurant

07:34.688 --> 07:35.689
to pick up Owen?

07:35.689 --> 07:36.824
Does your son have a passport?

07:36.824 --> 07:39.026
Yes, the judge ordered
Sam to hand it over to me.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.662
Good, so you have it?

07:41.662 --> 07:44.364
Well, Sam kind of handles
all the logistical stuff,

07:44.364 --> 07:46.934
I'm...I'm not really sure
where it is.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.769
I'm--I'm not even sure
that he gave it to me.

07:48.769 --> 07:49.970
Hold on, you're not sure?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.371
I'm not sure
of anything right now!

07:51.371 --> 07:54.842
I just want Owen back.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.179
Wow, she's a space cadet.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.881
I'll call Port Authority
and ICE, put an alert out

08:00.881 --> 08:01.915
on the kid and his passport.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.416
Hey, radio the squad car too.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.953
Have them keep Mr. Farhidi
at his restaurant.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.755
For the moment,
he's a suspect.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.189
We got security footage.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.559
We also pulled all
the traffic cams in the area.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.360
Unis are canvassing.
So far, no witnesses.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.895
Okay, check
other surveillance.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.897
See if we can get
the kidnapper walking away.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.032
Fin, get a sketch artist
for Mrs. Dugan.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.401
And, Nick, in the meantime,
go to the restaurant.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.736
Speak with Mr. Farhidi.

08:22.736 --> 08:26.439
There are passport issues,
custody issues, the works.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.642
- And Mrs. Farhidi?
- Take her to the precinct.

08:28.642 --> 08:31.411
Carisi, go to that yoga class.
Find that phone.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.946
On it.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.318
Detective Sonny Carisi.
NYPD.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.589
Hi, are you here to sign up
for the stress reduction class?

08:41.589 --> 08:43.090
Uh, no, I'm here to pick up
a cell phone.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.391
It was left inside.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.159
Wait, you actually
can't go in there right now

08:46.159 --> 08:48.596
'cause they're already
in Adho Mukha Svanasana, so.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.030
Downward facing dog.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.132
They need to be
listening to their bodies.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.901
Um, well, okay.
I'll be very quiet.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.402
Unless you have a warrant,

08:55.402 --> 08:58.238
I can't let you
disturb the class.

09:00.874 --> 09:05.245
[cell phone rings]

09:05.245 --> 09:08.081
Kind of hard to hear
your body over that, right?

09:08.081 --> 09:12.085
Excuse me.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.956
Look what I got.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.393
Well, someone called the school.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.095
Well, I didn't call
the school.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.897
I told the other
officers that.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.834
Mind if I check your phone?

09:26.834 --> 09:28.235
Check all you want.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.737
But you're wasting your time.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.339
You should be out there
looking for my son.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.440
I know what
you are thinking.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.308
Yeah, what am I thinking?

09:35.308 --> 09:37.110
Oh, please, you look at me

09:37.110 --> 09:40.113
and you see an Arab man
trying to steal his son.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.282
But I'm not even Arab.
I'm Iranian.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.417
A loyal American,
not a terrorist.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.654
No one's saying
you're a terrorist.

09:46.654 --> 09:48.421
Oh, my ex-wife didn't?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.357
She used that card throughout
the whole custody battle.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.859
Yeah, I've been
through one of those.

09:51.859 --> 09:55.128
They get rough.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.864
Tell me about it.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.000
Now imagine
a white female judge

10:00.000 --> 10:02.169
and a Middle Eastern man.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.971
Dana made the judge
to say that Owen

10:03.971 --> 10:06.606
cannot come to Iran with me.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.510
That must be upsetting.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.846
Oh, I didn't take my son.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.381
I've been here all day.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.783
Dana was supposed
to pick him up.

10:15.783 --> 10:16.850
Where was she?

10:16.850 --> 10:18.852
- She was running late.
- Again?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.220
What a surprise.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.022
I told her something
like this will happen.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.457
Just so we're clear,
you did not send

10:24.457 --> 10:26.559
a male Hispanic
to pick Owen up?

10:26.559 --> 10:29.029
No, I swear.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.099
Please find my son.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.670
Pretty grainy,
not much help.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.338
All right,
but that is Owen.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.773
Where's Sam?
Did you talk to him?

10:39.773 --> 10:40.774
- Okay.
- Does he have Owen?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.442
We don't think so.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.944
We do have one of our
detectives with him now,

10:43.944 --> 10:45.946
but, Mrs. Farhidi,
we have some images

10:45.946 --> 10:47.647
that we'd like you
to look through.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.587
(Fin)
You recognize that man?

10:54.587 --> 10:56.957
- No, who is that?
- So you don't know him?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.192
Well, I can't see his face.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.361
Okay, I--I need you
to come with me.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.931
All right, have a seat
in this room

11:03.931 --> 11:06.834
and I'll be with you
in a moment.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.601
Okay, anything else?

11:08.601 --> 11:11.638
The rest of the security
footage is no help either.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.807
The kidnapper knew
to keep his head down

11:13.807 --> 11:15.008
and hide his face.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.509
Okay, anything
on the traffic cams?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.611
- We're going through them now.
- All right.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.947
I got the mom's
cell phone.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.949
Eight missed calls,
ignore the one from me,

11:21.949 --> 11:23.316
and two messages
from a blocked number,

11:23.316 --> 11:25.018
which I can't access
without a password.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.820
Okay, so she's in
the interview room.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.555
Uh, get these images
to Amaro,

11:28.555 --> 11:32.192
and see if the father
can make an I.D.

11:32.192 --> 11:38.065
My voicemail code is O-W-E-N.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.968
(Owen on phone)
Mom, he won't let me come home
until you answer your phone.

11:40.968 --> 11:42.235
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.773
Okay, try the next one.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.674
(Owen on phone)
Mom, why aren't you
picking up?

11:47.674 --> 11:50.410
Answer next time.
Please, Mom?

11:50.410 --> 11:53.847
If I had my phone,
he'd be back.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.789
I don't know.
Based on that, he's a stranger.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.291
So your son would just go off
with a stranger?

12:04.291 --> 12:05.959
Owen is the way he is.

12:05.959 --> 12:10.230
He talks to a homeless man
like they are old friends.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.265
He's too trusting.

12:17.805 --> 12:22.442
These are pics we got back
from the traffic cams.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.911
Run the plates.
Put out an Amber Alert.

12:23.911 --> 12:25.512
- On it, Sarge.
- What is it?

12:25.512 --> 12:28.816
- What did you find?
- Dana, do you know this man?

12:28.816 --> 12:30.818
- Oh, my God, that's Javier.
- Javier who?

12:30.818 --> 12:32.352
Uh, I--I don't know
his last name.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.822
That's, um, he's Fabiana's
boyfriend.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.956
She recommended him to me.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.024
She said he was good
with his hands.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.491
So Fabiana is Owen's nanny?

12:38.491 --> 12:40.527
Well, part time now.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.629
I had to cut her hours.
She has another job.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.031
Okay, do you have
an address?

12:44.031 --> 12:45.833
I--I--I don't know.
Somewhere in the Bronx.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.200
I'm not really--we just--
we text each other.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.370
So text her now
and find out where she is.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.444
Hey.
Hey, Owen?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.113
Owen?
- What's going on?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.714
Fabiana Caldera?

13:01.714 --> 13:03.083
- Your boyfriend's Javier?
- Yes.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.852
Owen, where is he?

13:04.852 --> 13:06.920
Owen?
I don't have him today.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.856
We're wasting our time.
Let's bring her in.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.557
I--I have to watch
these two boys.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.460
Tell us where Javier is now.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.395
Ahora mismo,
or these kids' parents

13:15.395 --> 13:17.630
can pick them up
at the police station.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.936
(Carisi)
You run the building?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.737
Yeah, Javier Rojas isn't listed
on any of the leases here.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.239
Could be a hotbed apartment.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.975
The nanny said he was
in the basement unit.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.910
All right, you two
go around the back.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.644
Our first priority is Owen.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.281
Clear the apartment,
and be careful.

13:35.983 --> 13:38.185
(Amaro)
Policia.
Abran la puerta!

13:42.055 --> 13:43.423
- [grunts]
- [shouting in Spanish]

13:43.423 --> 13:44.992
Policia, no se muevan.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.895
- No se muevan.
- Suban las manos.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.963
Put your hands up.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.431
Quien habla Ingles?

13:51.431 --> 13:53.066
Conoces a Javier Rojas?

13:53.066 --> 13:55.102
No se nada.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.403
No?

13:56.403 --> 13:57.770
Mira, Javier secuestra--
a un nino?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.139
Eh, donde estan?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.908
No, Javier wouldn't
kidnap nobody.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.309
Oh, so now you
speak English.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.510
You've seen Javier?

14:03.510 --> 14:04.744
Yesterday.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.146
He stay here sometimes.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.747
Where is he now?
He have a job?

14:07.747 --> 14:08.982
He quit job.

14:15.956 --> 14:16.089
.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.358
Miss Caldera.
Appreciate you coming in.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.660
You gave me no choice.
Take your hands off me.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.929
Where's Javier?

14:21.929 --> 14:23.396
He wasn't at that address
you gave us.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.531
Then I don't know.
Let me go.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.066
I have kids to care for.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.834
The number you gave
us didn't work either.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.569
What do you want me to say?
I don't hear from him.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.604
Well, then we're gonna have
you call every single number

14:31.604 --> 14:33.506
in your cell phone
until he answers.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.943
Fabiana?
Fabiana, thank God you're here.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.410
Where's Owen?
Do you know?

14:37.410 --> 14:38.511
Miss Dana, no, I swear.

14:38.511 --> 14:39.746
I don't know where Owen is.

14:39.746 --> 14:42.082
Please, Fabiana, help them.
Help me.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.550
I don't know anything.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.952
(Benson)
Carisi, take her
to interrogation.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.719
For what--I under arrest
or something?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.588
Yeah, we're gonna hold you
as a material witness.

14:48.588 --> 14:51.558
You need to tell us everything
that you know about Javier.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.260
- Keep her talking.
- Come on.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.363
Incoming call on Dana's
cell is a video request.

14:56.363 --> 14:59.032
Okay, not here.
Uh, this way.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.268
Come.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.703
Here, up against the toys,
right here.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.112
- Hello?
- Where you been, Dana?

15:12.112 --> 15:14.982
My phone...I didn't have it.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.149
Where's Owen?

15:16.149 --> 15:18.185
You talk to anybody?
The police?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.720
No, I didn't.
I didn't talk to anybody.

15:20.720 --> 15:25.058
Please, Javier, I need to see
that Owen is all right.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.826
(Javier)
$37,000 in cash.

15:26.826 --> 15:27.894
I don't have that.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.562
(Javier)
Mr. Sam has money.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.797
You ask him.

15:30.797 --> 15:33.766
I will.
Just let me see Owen.

15:33.766 --> 15:36.136
Please.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.005
Oh, God, don't hurt him.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.573
(Javier)
Tell them, Owen.
What I said.

15:40.573 --> 15:44.077
Please, you have to do
what Javier says.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.378
(Javier)
I text you where.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.913
When.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.681
Mr. Sam bring money.

15:48.681 --> 15:53.020
I see any police,
I kill the boy.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.224
Okay, we still have a unit
with Farhidi?

15:57.224 --> 15:58.258
Absolutely.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.892
- Bring him in here.
- Yeah.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.798
You heard his demands.
You got the address.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.134
What are you waiting for?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.135
I don't have that kind
of money.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.136
- I do.
- What?

16:09.136 --> 16:10.737
I mean I can get it.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.072
Whatever brings Owen back.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.440
Listen, I know that this
is stressful,

16:13.440 --> 16:15.242
but you need to let
us do our jobs.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.343
You cannot be involved.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.410
You heard him.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.911
I'm supposed to go alone.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.313
We can allow you
to make the drop,

16:20.313 --> 16:21.781
but we'll be there as backup.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.050
But you're gonna need
to wear a wire.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.584
No.
My son, my call.

16:24.584 --> 16:25.918
I will do this on my own.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.520
I'm sorry, but that's not
an option.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.289
Hey, Sarge.
I just ran the building.

16:29.289 --> 16:30.857
I accessed maps
for that entire block.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.859
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.861
So Javier says he's gonna
meet in the basement

16:34.861 --> 16:36.463
of this building here.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.298
We won't be able to get a shot
or even see him.

16:38.298 --> 16:39.866
Yeah, and this building
shares an alleyway

16:39.866 --> 16:41.068
with all these
other buildings.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.302
That's a lot of hidey-holes.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.603
Okay, guys,
you know the drill.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.272
Keep a very low profile.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.074
Nick and Fin, you guys
are on the street.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.076
Carisi, you go with ESU.

16:49.076 --> 16:52.079
Mr. Farhidi, come on,
I'd like to get you prepped.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.455
He said that he'll be
in the basement.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.758
When you see your son,
you put down the money

17:05.758 --> 17:07.894
and you get out.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.796
No heroics.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.298
Understood?

17:11.298 --> 17:13.233
Understood.
Absolutely.

17:34.921 --> 17:37.957
Okay, I'm--I'm in.

17:37.957 --> 17:39.492
(Sam)
Javier?

17:39.492 --> 17:40.893
Javier?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.731
Are--are you down here?

17:44.731 --> 17:47.834
Please, let Owen go.
Everything is fine.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.138
I have your money.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.805
- What--what's happening?
- We're finding out.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.274
Fin, what do we have?

17:54.274 --> 17:57.344
Nothing.
No visual, no audio.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.612
All right,
then we've got to go.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.548
Move now.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.220
Go, go.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.157
I got him.

18:10.157 --> 18:11.591
Okay, we got the kid.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.825
Okay, he'll be fine.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.161
And Javier?

18:14.161 --> 18:15.595
Where is he?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.230
Where's Javier?

18:17.230 --> 18:20.032
I don't know, I just took--took
Owen and got out.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.901
- I think he run.
- Suspect's on the move.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.770
Come on.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.904
All units go.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.273
Hostage is secured.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.540
Suspect is in flight.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.177
[door thudding]
NYPD!

18:30.177 --> 18:31.911
Police!

18:35.182 --> 18:37.217
Clear.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.718
Go.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.288
Oh, my God, thank God.
Baby, Mommy's here.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.522
Mommy's here.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.624
Ooh.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.838
Found a hole.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.477
He may be in the alley
next door.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.679
(man)
I'm on it.

19:16.956 --> 19:20.227
Police!
Stop!

19:22.729 --> 19:24.631
Don't move!

19:24.631 --> 19:26.666
Get down, on your knees.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.901
Ustedes no entienden.
I no kidnap.

19:28.901 --> 19:32.239
No, then what were you
doing with that kid?

19:32.239 --> 19:36.142
Miss Dana pay me
to take him.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.677
You ask her.

19:47.287 --> 19:47.420
.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.522
Javier swears
that Owen's mother

19:50.523 --> 19:51.658
put him up to the kidnapping.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.659
Yeah, that's his story
and he stuck to it.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.394
Then he lawyered up.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.729
Well, that's one way to go.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.665
Okay, let's keep him
in holding.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.066
How's the boy?
He seemed okay.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.568
He slept for a few hours.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.270
They're doing
a full work up on him now.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.772
- And his parents?
- Carisi's keeping them apart.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.574
Do we really need to keep
them away from Owen?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.709
No access without
a third party.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.512
Look, it's a messy divorce.
There are custody issues.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.880
Javier has made
this accusation.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.782
Let's just play it safe.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.216
- Sergeant?
- Yes.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.085
- I finished examining Owen.
- And?

20:19.085 --> 20:21.354
He's in shock, showing signs
of psychological trauma.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.455
And physically?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.090
Abrasions on the wrist
and ankles.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.292
No signs of sexual assault.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.294
I need to run a few more
routine tests.

20:27.294 --> 20:28.861
I'd like to talk
to him first.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.430
I understand.
Please tread lightly.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.065
Okay.
Of course.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.134
Hey, can we tell
the parents that much?

20:35.134 --> 20:36.903
Yes, but that's it.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.139
No need to tell them about
Javier's accusations either.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.915
Hi, Owen.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.117
My name's Olivia.
Thanks.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.820
I'm a police officer.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.154
Am I in trouble?

20:55.154 --> 20:57.990
No.
Not at all.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.126
I should have waited
for my Mom.

21:00.126 --> 21:02.329
Oh, honey.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.063
It's not your fault
that the man took you

21:04.063 --> 21:07.734
from school.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.503
So Owen, I was wondering

21:10.503 --> 21:12.339
if I could ask you
a couple of questions.

21:12.339 --> 21:16.376
If you could tell me
about him.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.711
Did you know him?

21:18.711 --> 21:21.414
Not really.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.150
He was at my house
once or twice.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.985
He fixed the sink.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.854
I think Fabiana knows him.

21:27.854 --> 21:32.692
Oh, okay, did he tell you
his name?

21:32.692 --> 21:35.094
At first he said
it was Carlos,

21:35.094 --> 21:38.230
then he said
it was Javier.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.568
All right, did he tell
you anything else?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.370
No, I talked mostly.

21:43.370 --> 21:46.005
He didn't really know English.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.608
So you were talking?

21:48.608 --> 21:50.176
What about?

21:50.176 --> 21:51.678
School and stuff.

21:51.678 --> 21:55.448
He was nice
till I wanted to go home.

21:55.448 --> 21:59.452
Then he made me get in a van.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.655
That must have
been pretty scary.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.091
Mm-hmm.
We drove around.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.660
I had to call my mom
on his phone.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.630
Mm hmm--so Owen, let me
ask you something.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.865
Who dialed your mom's number?

22:12.865 --> 22:16.202
Did you dial it or did he?

22:16.202 --> 22:18.838
He dialed it,
and I left a message.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.039
She didn't picked up.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.408
Owen, honey, she would have,

22:21.408 --> 22:23.510
but she didn't have
her phone with her.

22:23.510 --> 22:28.948
Yeah, she loses it a lot.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.717
So, Owen, can you think
of anything else

22:30.717 --> 22:33.653
that he may have said
about--about Fabiana

22:33.653 --> 22:37.890
or about your mom,
anything?

22:37.890 --> 22:40.427
He got mad when Mom
didn't pick up.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.662
He got mad?

22:42.662 --> 22:45.331
What did he say?

22:45.331 --> 22:48.535
He yelled,
"She's supposed to answer!"

22:48.535 --> 22:51.203
Then he yelled
some other things in Spanish.

22:51.203 --> 22:55.074
I think they were bad words.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.043
How much longer
is this gonna take?

22:57.043 --> 22:58.911
Sam is not in there with him,
is he?

22:58.911 --> 23:02.449
No, just our Sergeant.
And we appreciate your consent.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.751
Children are more open when
their parents aren't around.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.952
Well, when can I see him?

23:05.952 --> 23:07.454
Soon.

23:07.454 --> 23:08.621
While we're waiting,
we'd like to ask you

23:08.621 --> 23:10.757
a few questions
if that's okay.

23:10.757 --> 23:14.293
If Javier wanted money,
why did he call you and not Sam?

23:14.293 --> 23:17.464
I'm--I'm not sure.
He doesn't really know Sam.

23:17.464 --> 23:18.931
Okay, well, when he called
he seemed pretty confident

23:18.931 --> 23:20.567
that Sam would have the cash.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.102
- How would he now that?
- I don't know.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.336
Could your nanny have told him?

23:24.336 --> 23:26.506
No, Fabiana would never.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.940
She loves Owen.

23:27.940 --> 23:29.476
Have you ever
talked about your divorce

23:29.476 --> 23:30.743
or Sam's money with her?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.579
Yes, of course.
She's my friend.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.280
I didn't want her to think
that cutting back her hours

23:34.280 --> 23:36.683
was my idea.

23:36.683 --> 23:39.018
Dana, she reacted strangely
when you said

23:39.018 --> 23:40.853
you had that much money.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.489
We just went
through a divorce.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.757
She counts
every penny I have.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.494
I hear that, though any idea
why Javier would think

23:47.494 --> 23:49.028
you had that kind of dough?

23:49.028 --> 23:51.163
Oh, I don't know.

23:51.163 --> 23:52.665
He just got into this country.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.634
He probably thinks
everybody has money.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.302
Did you ask him?

23:56.302 --> 23:57.770
No, he's not saying much.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.640
So who pays the help--
you or your ex-wife?

24:00.640 --> 24:02.174
I do.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.744
If I give Dana her money
at the start of the week,

24:04.744 --> 24:06.245
she has nothing left
the next day.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.880
All right, so they know
Mr. Sam is the one

24:07.880 --> 24:10.116
who pays the bills.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.018
What's wrong
with these people?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.553
I worked my whole life.

24:13.553 --> 24:18.224
They think they can come
and take what's mine.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.527
So Fabiana knew that Sam
had all that cash.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.861
She heard it from Dana.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.262
And Sam was the one
who paid the help.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.565
- Fabiana lawyer up?
- Not yet.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.567
Get her talking.

24:29.536 --> 24:31.103
I don't need a lawyer,

24:31.103 --> 24:33.039
and I don't know
how this happened.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.807
You can keep asking,
but I don't know.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.576
You don't know?

24:36.576 --> 24:37.877
So you're telling us
you don't know how Javier

24:37.877 --> 24:39.045
got the number to that school?

24:39.045 --> 24:40.613
No.

24:40.613 --> 24:41.614
Oh, and you didn't tell him
that Dana would be late?

24:41.614 --> 24:42.815
That Sam would have the cash?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.216
No.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.318
So he just figured
this all out on his own?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.788
Yo no se.
I don't know.

24:48.788 --> 24:51.423
You want me to say
in another language?

24:51.423 --> 24:53.125
Javier must have
put you up to this.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.460
I mean, did he threaten you?

24:54.460 --> 24:57.163
He would never do nothing
like that.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.798
Fabiana, let's be straight.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.734
We know you're mad
because they cut your hours.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.170
What?
No, it worked out.

25:04.170 --> 25:06.238
I go from 14 an hour
for one kid

25:06.238 --> 25:08.240
to 22 an hour for two.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.677
Besides, I was happy to get
out of that house.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.712
Happy, why?

25:12.712 --> 25:15.648
I love Owen, but Dana?

25:15.648 --> 25:17.817
After the divorce, she couldn't
stop talking.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.151
How Sam was so cheap.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.087
How he want her
to go back to work.

25:21.087 --> 25:24.156
You ever talk to Javier
about their financial issues?

25:24.156 --> 25:25.858
He already knew.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.728
Dana told him, in Spanish,
while he was fixing things.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.663
And how often would
Javier go over there?

25:30.663 --> 25:33.766
All the time.
She call him for everything.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.034
Toilet's running.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.703
Shower's clogged.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.271
A cockroach that maybe
is dead, but she can't tell.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.608
She need to get herself a man,
stop calling mine.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.676
And were you always there
when Javier was?

25:43.676 --> 25:45.678
No, I got other jobs.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.213
I go to school.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.182
So Javier would just show up
whenever she'd call?

25:50.182 --> 25:53.820
He needs money.
He does whatever Dana say.

25:53.820 --> 25:55.922
Let me go.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.423
Hey, Sarge.

25:57.423 --> 25:59.926
This $37,000 dollar ransom
seemed a little--

25:59.926 --> 26:01.427
Specific?

26:01.427 --> 26:03.429
Bingo, so I looked up
the divorce affidavits

26:03.429 --> 26:05.097
for Sam and Dana Farhidi.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.366
She accused him
of hiding cash assets.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.136
$37,000 worth.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.872
You and Fin find out where
Javier got that number.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.645
Fabiana had nothing
to do with this.

26:18.645 --> 26:20.379
Leave her alone.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.682
She didn't tell you how
much money to ask for in ransom?

26:22.682 --> 26:25.685
Miss Dana did.
She tell me $37,000.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.353
Mr. Sam will pay.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.655
I do nothing wrong.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.990
No?
You took a kid.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.191
You demanded money
from his parents.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.793
That's kidnapping, Javier.

26:33.793 --> 26:37.797
Mr. Rojas was hired
by Mrs. Farhidi to pick Owen up,

26:37.797 --> 26:40.466
drive him around for a while,
then call her.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.903
This was an activity
sanctioned by the mother.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.672
Are you calling this
a play date, counselor?

26:45.672 --> 26:47.707
Let's not get
hung up on semantics.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.475
The fact remains
that Mrs. Farhidi

26:49.475 --> 26:52.144
granted him permission
to take her son

26:52.144 --> 26:55.882
and guaranteed payment
through her ex-husband.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.149
You got proof of that?

26:57.149 --> 26:58.517
She paid my client the first

26:58.517 --> 27:02.488
of two installments
of $500 last Monday.

27:02.488 --> 27:05.457
She then texted him the number
to call at the school,

27:05.457 --> 27:07.493
told him how to sign
her son out,

27:07.493 --> 27:09.829
then made sure
she'd be late picking him up.

27:09.829 --> 27:10.963
Texted him, huh?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.398
There's nothing on his phone.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.966
No, the texts,
they're on my old phone.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.735
They're on your old phone.

27:15.735 --> 27:17.169
We're gonna need that number.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.238
Absolutely.

27:19.238 --> 27:22.975
You give us a deal,
we give you the phone.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.813
You have no leverage here,
and we're not asking.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.715
Give us the number.

27:36.622 --> 27:39.191
He's claiming Dana
texted him?

27:39.191 --> 27:40.993
Bad bluff if she didn't.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.730
Yeah, that and the cash payment
should be easy to confirm.

27:43.730 --> 27:44.831
Okay, where's Dana now?

27:44.831 --> 27:46.532
Still at the CAC
waiting to see Owen.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.167
Bring her in.

27:55.742 --> 27:55.842
.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.044
You think that I would let
Javier take my son,

27:59.511 --> 28:04.383
tie him up, just to prove
my ex-husband's an ass?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.185
I would never put Owen
through that.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.519
The ransom demand
was the exact amount

28:07.519 --> 28:08.888
you accused Sam of hiding.

28:08.888 --> 28:11.623
Well, Javier or Fabiana

28:11.623 --> 28:13.960
must have heard me talking
on the phone to my lawyer.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.863
Did you recently take out
$1,000 in cash?

28:16.863 --> 28:20.566
I owed Javier
for some work that he did.

28:20.566 --> 28:22.401
Work, huh?

28:22.401 --> 28:26.505
Now was that the job you were
talking about in these texts?

28:33.780 --> 28:36.048
I've never seen
these before in my life.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.649
Who sent these?

28:37.649 --> 28:39.451
These texts
came from your phone.

28:39.451 --> 28:41.320
That's impossible.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.555
I don't understand.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.392
Is there anyone else
who has access to your phone?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.928
No--I mean, sometimes Owen
plays games on it.

28:48.928 --> 28:52.131
Oh, so Owen arranged
his own kidnapping, right?

28:52.131 --> 28:54.633
Of course not.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.003
I left my phone
at a yoga studio.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.670
Maybe somebody did it
from there.

28:58.670 --> 29:01.507
These texts were sent
a week ago.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.709
Well, I misplace my phone
all of the time.

29:03.709 --> 29:05.912
You can ask Owen.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.447
He always tells me
I'm not good with things.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.822
"Not good with things."

29:15.822 --> 29:17.389
That's her defense?

29:17.389 --> 29:19.091
It's possible.
My middle sister?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.393
She's losing her keys,
her phone, her car.

29:21.393 --> 29:23.595
I mean, every five minutes,
it's something.

29:23.595 --> 29:25.064
So are we back to
the--the nanny?

29:25.064 --> 29:26.833
- She had access.
- Come on.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.100
Dana's mad at her ex.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.401
She needs money.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.838
She hired this Javier
for everything else.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.105
Look, it's pretty clear
that Owen

29:33.105 --> 29:34.841
is the parent in the house.

29:34.841 --> 29:36.542
I mean, Dana said
to ask him about it.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.710
Maybe we should.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.682
Sergeant Benson?

29:43.682 --> 29:45.584
Oh, Mr. Farhidi,
how are you?

29:45.584 --> 29:48.020
I want to take my son home.
That's how I am.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.389
Well, I can certainly
understand that.

29:50.389 --> 29:53.425
I saw some officers
put Dana in a squad car.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.560
What's going on?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.628
Well, we're still
investigating.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.964
I told you everything I know,

29:57.964 --> 29:59.631
but if you have any more
questions, go ahead.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.902
Well, actually, we're here
to speak with Owen.

30:02.902 --> 30:04.636
Hasn't he been through enough?

30:04.636 --> 30:06.105
And don't I have a right

30:06.105 --> 30:08.407
to be there when you're
asking him questions?

30:08.407 --> 30:10.209
Dana already gave us consent
to talk to him

30:10.209 --> 30:13.279
without a guardian,
but if that's a problem for you?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.081
No, it's not a problem,

30:15.081 --> 30:17.917
I--I'm just wondering
what's left to be investigated.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.218
Okay, you handle this.

30:19.218 --> 30:23.055
I mean, you--you caught
Javier red handed.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.557
I don't know what she told you,
but do I need to get a lawyer

30:25.557 --> 30:28.094
for Owen or Dana?

30:28.094 --> 30:29.495
That's absolutely
your right,

30:29.495 --> 30:31.597
but if your ex-wife
had nothing to do with this,

30:31.597 --> 30:34.266
then there's really nothing
to worry about.

30:34.266 --> 30:38.004
Mr. Farhidi, we're just--we're
asking for your patience here.

30:38.004 --> 30:40.006
So why don't you go outside,
you have a smoke,

30:40.006 --> 30:44.610
and when we're done,
we'll give you a call, okay?

30:46.178 --> 30:50.249
(both)
[growling]

30:50.249 --> 30:51.683
Most of the time
I'm at school

30:51.683 --> 30:53.419
so I don't really know
who comes over.

30:53.419 --> 30:54.820
Well, that's okay, Owen.

30:54.820 --> 30:57.156
We're actually
even more interested

30:57.156 --> 31:00.292
in who comes
over when you are at home.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.361
Mm.
Do I have to say?

31:02.361 --> 31:04.530
I don't want to get him
in trouble with my mom.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.599
Okay, well, we're the police
so we can keep a secret,

31:07.599 --> 31:09.201
I promise.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.938
Mm.
Okay.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.405
My dad.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.574
Sometimes he comes over
when he's technically

31:15.574 --> 31:19.345
not supposed to.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.780
Okay, so your dad comes over.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.549
And what does he do?

31:23.549 --> 31:25.217
He talks with me, mostly.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.752
- We play.
- That's cool.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.788
- What do you talk about?
- About my mom.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.959
If she ever has friends
that are boys over.

31:32.959 --> 31:34.126
Mm-hmm.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.861
So what else does he do?

31:35.861 --> 31:38.464
Sometimes he checks the smoke
detectors for batteries.

31:38.464 --> 31:42.368
Does your dad ever maybe look
at your mom's iPad or computer?

31:42.368 --> 31:45.404
You know, like when you guys
are playing games, or--?

31:45.404 --> 31:48.040
Um, no, he doesn't like me
staring at the screen.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.576
Sometimes he takes
my mom's phone away.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.980
Hold on, your mom leaves her
phone at home when she goes out?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.314
She forgets things.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.649
Or sometimes I want
to play on it,

31:57.649 --> 31:59.986
and she doesn't really
notice it's missing.

31:59.986 --> 32:01.753
Okay.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.456
So, Owen, what does your dad do

32:04.456 --> 32:09.561
with your mom's phone
when he takes it?

32:09.561 --> 32:13.632
I think he goes through
her emails and her photos.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.301
Yeah, guys do that.

32:15.301 --> 32:19.705
Um, when you dad's there,
is anyone else, like a nanny?

32:19.705 --> 32:21.307
Yeah, Fabiana's there.

32:21.307 --> 32:24.043
But sometimes when Daddy
comes over she goes out

32:24.043 --> 32:25.877
and gets me something
from McDonald's.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.380
I'm not supposed
to tell Mom about that either.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.388
Why are you still talking
to her?

32:36.388 --> 32:37.823
Think about it, Javier.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.658
I told you, she's innocent.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.827
Let the detectives
ask their questions.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.029
That's good advice.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.830
You should also advise
your client

32:44.830 --> 32:46.898
to come clean
about Fabiana Caldera.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.034
She didn't know.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.835
What about the texts?

32:49.835 --> 32:52.038
I really appreciate you trying
to protect your girlfriend,

32:52.038 --> 32:55.074
but we got her fingerprints
all over Dana's cell phone.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.608
She also had Owen's schedule

32:56.608 --> 32:59.445
and knew exactly how much
cash Mr. Farhidi had.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.280
No, no, it was all Miss Dana.

33:01.280 --> 33:03.349
No, it wasn't.

33:03.349 --> 33:07.253
A mother would never do that
to her own son.

33:07.253 --> 33:09.488
You know, lying to the police
is also a crime.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.859
Tell him, counselor.
All right, last chance.

33:13.859 --> 33:16.862
What did Fabiana ask you
to do, Javier?

33:21.167 --> 33:24.470
[inaudible whispering]

33:30.442 --> 33:34.280
Mr. Rojas would like
to revise his statement.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.148
We're listening.

33:36.148 --> 33:38.150
If we tell you
who really set this up,

33:38.150 --> 33:40.286
what's in it for my client?

33:40.286 --> 33:41.820
How about not taking
the weight

33:41.820 --> 33:44.356
of a felony kidnapping charge
all on his own?

33:48.327 --> 33:50.196
It was Mr. Sam.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.969
He told me to say
it was all Miss Dana.

34:07.146 --> 34:07.279
.

34:11.016 --> 34:11.617
First Javier swears it's Dana.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.786
Now he swears it's Sam?

34:14.786 --> 34:17.022
Maybe he's still trying
to protect Fabiana.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.857
Could be,
but Sam's a controlling guy.

34:18.857 --> 34:20.726
I went back
over the divorce affidavits.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.428
She was the one who filed.
Maybe he's trying to hurt her.

34:22.428 --> 34:24.130
Okay, thanks.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.031
Yeah, you and me both.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.699
That was Barba checking
in from St. Barths.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.368
He says we can charge
him with kidnapping,

34:29.368 --> 34:31.137
but when it comes to anyone
else, Javier's word

34:31.137 --> 34:32.538
is no good on this.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.940
We all know he's nothing
but a fall guy.

34:34.940 --> 34:36.242
But for whom?

34:38.977 --> 34:41.980
Dana says she's innocent.
Let her prove it.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.618
Sam knows I've been
talking to the police.

34:46.618 --> 34:47.819
What am I supposed to say?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.288
Well, he thinks
you're s suspect.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.557
Tell him that.
Ask him for help.

34:51.557 --> 34:53.792
There's no way
Sam did this.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.928
So what's the problem?

35:08.039 --> 35:12.077
I haven't been here
in a while.

35:12.077 --> 35:14.980
You and everyone else.

35:14.980 --> 35:19.318
This winter was...
It was tough.

35:19.318 --> 35:22.087
What are we gonna do, Sam?

35:23.855 --> 35:25.424
You can go home, Damien.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.359
Thanks.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.761
Owen is sleeping
at the CAC.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.564
They might put him
in a foster home.

35:32.564 --> 35:36.235
The police really think
that I did this.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.204
- That's ridiculous.
- Not to them it's not.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.738
They're convinced
I set this whole thing up.

35:39.738 --> 35:42.208
Sent Javier cash.

35:42.208 --> 35:44.075
Sent texts.

35:44.075 --> 35:46.044
You can't even
balance your checkbook.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.548
Can't you tell them that?

35:49.548 --> 35:52.218
You want me to fix
this for you?

35:52.218 --> 35:55.754
Why not?
It's what you do.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.724
Because I cannot fix
everything for everyone.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.092
I had to let
three people go here.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.461
You're bleeding me
with alimony.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.862
You were hiding
all of that cash.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.096
I had to!

36:05.096 --> 36:08.300
You would have blown
right through it.

36:10.135 --> 36:12.438
You actually don't know
how much things cost.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.873
You never paid attention.

36:14.873 --> 36:16.542
So now you're blaming me?

36:16.542 --> 36:20.812
We might never get
our son back.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.714
Yes, we will.

36:22.714 --> 36:28.153
I will take custody, and you
won't actually go to jail.

36:28.153 --> 36:32.258
Wait, what?
You believe them?

36:32.258 --> 36:36.328
You think that I
actually did this?

36:36.328 --> 36:38.464
No, but it was
your own damn fault.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.898
How?

36:39.898 --> 36:41.833
If you had your phone
with you when Javier called,

36:41.833 --> 36:43.168
the whole thing
wouldn't have happened.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.703
The police wouldn't
have been involved.

36:44.703 --> 36:49.040
What?
What does that mean?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.509
He called you.

36:50.509 --> 36:54.413
You weren't there for him.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.814
Owen needs protection.

36:55.814 --> 36:57.883
He's too trusting,
you know that.

36:57.883 --> 36:59.851
I don't want him
growing up in fear!

36:59.851 --> 37:01.753
There are different ways
of protecting him.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.456
That's it, you don't.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.325
You're late for pickups.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.793
Half the time
when I'm over there

37:07.793 --> 37:09.928
you have forgotten
to schedule your nanny.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.063
Owen is alone by himself
in your apartment.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.765
But you're there
when I'm not there?

37:13.765 --> 37:17.803
Yes, to check on him.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.472
I was actually trying
to protect him.

37:29.014 --> 37:33.585
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.955
You had him kidnapped?

37:39.024 --> 37:41.960
It was supposed
to be only half hour.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.763
Just to scare him,
teach him a lesson

37:44.763 --> 37:48.199
so he doesn't
walk away with strangers.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.536
To wake you up so
you'd pay more attention,

37:50.536 --> 37:53.639
so you are there for him.

37:53.639 --> 37:57.208
I lost you.
I didn't want to lose him too.

37:57.208 --> 38:00.812
- Oh, Sam, what have you done?
- I'm sorry.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.714
I'm sorry.

38:02.714 --> 38:04.783
I didn't mean for it
to go this far.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.585
No, Sam, don't say
another word.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.853
We have to figure this out.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.955
No, you don't understand.

38:09.955 --> 38:12.190
Stop.

38:16.094 --> 38:18.063
Did she just
show him her wire?

38:18.063 --> 38:23.134
Nick, Carisi, move in.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.571
The police said that
it would exonerate you.

38:25.571 --> 38:27.138
I didn't think
you actually did it.

38:27.138 --> 38:30.676
- Dana, you all right?
- I'm fine.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.148
This is not what I wanted.

38:41.653 --> 38:46.425
Me neither.

38:46.425 --> 38:49.595
Mr. Farhidi, you need
to come with us.

39:07.913 --> 39:11.550
Hey, Sarge?

39:11.550 --> 39:13.585
Can I take him now?

39:21.760 --> 39:25.030
The court gave you custody,

39:25.030 --> 39:29.435
but the question is, Dana,
can you take care of him?

39:33.505 --> 39:35.841
Look, I love Owen,
but I am afraid

39:35.841 --> 39:37.876
to do this by myself.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.244
And Sam is a really
good father,

39:39.244 --> 39:41.947
and I think that Owen
needs him.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.618
Can you tell the DA?

39:46.618 --> 39:48.754
That's not your decision.

39:48.754 --> 39:51.923
The DA will plead this
down to unlawful imprisonment,

39:51.923 --> 39:54.593
it's a misdemeanor,
but Sam could get six months.

39:54.593 --> 39:59.465
Six months?
How will I support myself?

39:59.465 --> 40:01.366
You'll have
to figure it out.

40:01.366 --> 40:02.868
You get a job.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.303
Right, there are a lot
of working mothers.

40:05.303 --> 40:08.574
It's been so long, I wouldn't
even know where to start.

40:08.574 --> 40:10.942
So learn.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.579
You have a child, Dana.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.916
It's not about you anymore.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.987
You need to be the parent,
not Owen.

40:35.667 --> 40:37.769
Thank you.
All of you.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.170
All right.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.006
Take good care, all right?

40:41.006 --> 40:43.074
Good bye, Owen.

40:43.074 --> 40:44.676
Bye, Sonny.

40:52.317 --> 40:53.619
Letting the kid
go with her,

40:53.619 --> 40:55.687
you think
that's a good idea?

40:55.687 --> 40:57.789
Well, Social Services
is gonna check in,

40:57.789 --> 41:00.592
for whatever that's worth.

41:00.592 --> 41:03.228
I think she
was pretty shaken up.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.230
She'll get her act together.

41:05.230 --> 41:06.898
So I have to leave
early today.

41:06.898 --> 41:07.899
Hold down the fort.

41:07.899 --> 41:10.836
- On it.
- Not you, Fin.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.004
It'll be good practice.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.273
What does she mean by that,
"good practice"?

41:15.273 --> 41:17.543
She's worried about them
bumping her up to Lieutenant.

41:17.543 --> 41:23.348
She's gonna need a new sergeant
and wants me to take the exam.

41:23.348 --> 41:26.251
Wow.
Congratulations.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.554
I'm not interested.
Not gonna happen.

41:28.554 --> 41:31.623
I don't need the headaches.
- You got that right.
