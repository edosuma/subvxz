WEBVTT

00:34.837 --> 00:36.047
Attention, everyone.

00:36.214 --> 00:39.884
We are opening our offices
for a totally unrestricted inspection.

00:40.051 --> 00:42.762
Therefore, each of you
will need to take home and hide...

00:42.929 --> 00:45.849
...one of our many illegal items.

00:46.016 --> 00:47.267
I hope ponies are illegal.

00:47.434 --> 00:50.771
First up, a life-size
Margaret Thatcher robot.

00:50.938 --> 00:54.066
- Sir, sir, over here.
- Sanders, she's all yours.

00:54.233 --> 00:55.692
- Yes.
- Oh, man.

00:59.655 --> 01:04.619
Europe was created by history,
America by philosophy.

01:05.745 --> 01:08.456
The mouth on this one.

01:10.667 --> 01:14.170
Okay, next, God's autograph.

01:16.881 --> 01:19.425
- Protestants only.
- Oh, gee whiz.

01:19.592 --> 01:21.262
Enjoy.

01:21.428 --> 01:25.599
And a machine that turns water
into cocaine. I'll just hang onto this.

01:27.935 --> 01:29.270
Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:29.436 --> 01:32.106
...I'm going to go
party my nose clean off my face.

01:32.273 --> 01:34.567
Sort out the rest yourselves.

01:34.733 --> 01:35.985
- Look.
- What's in that one?

01:36.527 --> 01:40.532
- That's mine, I called it.
- No, it's not, it's mine.

01:41.408 --> 01:44.953
Oh, it's a disintegrator?
I thought it was a penis enlarger.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.455
That almost went horribly wrong.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.752
Madam... Madam.

01:52.919 --> 01:54.838
Okay, I'll just let you talk.

01:55.005 --> 01:58.634
Oh, you done?
Okay, I will repeat myself one more time.

01:58.801 --> 02:01.721
I was making my grandchildren
some of your French onion soup.

02:01.887 --> 02:04.348
I poured the contents
of the can into a saucepan...

02:04.515 --> 02:06.183
...and out plops a human finger.

02:06.350 --> 02:09.562
Now, the stress of this incident
has given me walking nightmares...

02:09.729 --> 02:12.815
...street terrors,
diabetes and hysterical pregnancy.

02:12.982 --> 02:15.861
Now, I am going to require
a substantial cash settlement...

02:16.028 --> 02:17.571
...somewhere in the amount of...

02:17.738 --> 02:20.407
...whatever one of those
lonic Breeze machines costs.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.076
My address is... Huh?

02:23.243 --> 02:25.495
Do I have the finger?

02:27.039 --> 02:30.042
Damn.
The Lipton woman outfoxed me again.

02:30.208 --> 02:32.919
- Honey, look what I got.
- Oh, what is that stuff?

02:33.086 --> 02:36.758
It's CIA-grade, high-tech,
highly illegal surveillance equipment.

02:36.924 --> 02:40.178
Check it out. It's so sensitive,
you can hear a moth fart.

02:43.681 --> 02:47.352
Open a tiny window, moth.
How much fun is this thing, huh?

02:47.518 --> 02:51.857
Very fun, Stan, but we really need
to get going to the Memaris' barbecue.

02:52.024 --> 02:56.320
Or we could sit here in our underpants,
drink Scotch, and listen to the barbecue.

02:57.279 --> 02:58.906
I'm actually kind of hungry.

02:59.073 --> 03:01.658
You're right,
it wouldn't be fair to the neighbors.

03:01.825 --> 03:03.452
I'll stop by and make their week.

03:03.619 --> 03:07.081
Turn the chicken crap they call their lives
into chicken salad.

03:07.247 --> 03:10.168
The good kind, with grapes.

03:10.335 --> 03:13.755
Whoa, moth,
what the hell did you eat, a poncho?

03:13.922 --> 03:17.175
Get it? Because Mexican clothes
are like Mexican food for moths.

03:17.342 --> 03:19.552
We really should get over there,
I'm on fire.

03:22.347 --> 03:25.391
What else can I do?
What else can l...? Oh, I got it.

03:25.558 --> 03:29.230
Finger in a Hot Pocket.
Oh, wait, still need a finger.

03:29.396 --> 03:32.525
Look at Steve,
living by the sweat of his brow.

03:32.691 --> 03:35.778
Working hard to earn an honest buck.

03:35.945 --> 03:37.321
What a douche.

03:37.947 --> 03:40.866
- Doing a bang-up job, son.
- Thank you, Mr. Hallworthy.

03:41.033 --> 03:43.911
I'm going to a neighborhood party.
Not sure if I'm invited.

03:44.078 --> 03:47.999
All I know is I have a casserole dish
filled with mousetraps and I'm going.

03:48.166 --> 03:51.461
There, I've done it. I'm an old man
and I've said a crazy thing.

03:51.628 --> 03:55.048
Oh, my God, I have fallen.

03:55.215 --> 03:57.134
- Roger, are you okay?
- No.

03:57.300 --> 04:02.139
Yes. Play along. I'm gonna squeeze
this old coot for some quick cashish.

04:03.557 --> 04:06.394
- What? What's going on?
- I'm Steve's cousin.

04:06.561 --> 04:09.897
I tripped on your walkway and I need
compensation. I'll take a check.

04:10.064 --> 04:14.193
And I'll need two forms of ID. Passport's
okay, or a utility bill with your current...

04:14.360 --> 04:17.154
You know what? You're boring me.
Make it a thousand, cash.

04:18.322 --> 04:19.699
Roger, please don't do this.

04:19.866 --> 04:22.159
Mr. Hallworthy's
always been very sweet to me.

04:22.327 --> 04:25.622
As sweet as owning that PlayStation
you've been lusting after?

04:25.789 --> 04:27.708
Back me up and I'll buy it for you.

04:27.875 --> 04:31.753
Steven, you're a trustworthy young man.
Is your cousin on the up-and-up?

04:31.920 --> 04:35.924
Mr. Hallworthy,
I have to tell you the truth.

04:36.091 --> 04:38.844
Lying is awesome.

04:39.803 --> 04:42.098
So just to show him
I'm not a hardhearted man...

04:42.265 --> 04:46.978
...I bought all his oranges, I bought
all his walnuts, then I had him deported.

04:48.104 --> 04:51.566
Everyone knows the juiciest fruit
is bought on the roadside.

04:53.985 --> 04:55.320
Why, hello, Lisa.

04:55.486 --> 04:58.824
Stan, Francine.
This is Jared, my current lover.

04:58.991 --> 05:02.912
Mommy met Jared at Black Angus
while we waited in the car.

05:03.078 --> 05:05.331
Is that right? Well, aren't you a little...

05:07.458 --> 05:10.919
Just kidding, partner. You know,
sometimes in life you meet people who...

05:12.630 --> 05:16.926
Got you again.
Deuce, deuce. Two times.

05:17.761 --> 05:21.264
Well, come along, kids. You can play
house while Jared and I fornicate...

05:21.431 --> 05:24.809
...on your father's old weight bench.
- Quirky.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.936
Oh, are people heading home already?

05:27.103 --> 05:29.648
Afraid so, Bob.
You see, I've got a very busy...

05:30.315 --> 05:34.653
Dead kid. Mama's crying as she takes
your crayon drawings off the fridge.

05:35.321 --> 05:37.448
Francine, that was just what I needed.

05:37.615 --> 05:40.117
I'm surrounded by neighbors
who love me.

05:40.284 --> 05:43.412
Beloved. I feel I am beloved.

05:43.579 --> 05:47.541
<i>- Nurse, I'm ready for my bath.
- Who's there? Santa?</i>

05:47.708 --> 05:48.834
That's Mr. Hallworthy.

05:49.001 --> 05:52.004
I must have forgotten to turn off
my surveillance equipment.

05:52.171 --> 05:54.132
<i>Did you enjoy the barbecue, sir?</i>

05:54.299 --> 05:57.969
<i>Yes, except for Stan Smith 's
interminable yammering.</i>

05:58.136 --> 05:59.971
<i>I thought his stories would never end.</i>

06:00.138 --> 06:03.767
But that's the surprise. You think
my stories won't end, but they do.

06:03.934 --> 06:04.976
How could he...?

06:05.143 --> 06:08.438
How could he say such things?
Doesn't he know everyone loves me?

06:08.605 --> 06:11.233
Stan, maybe it's not right
to listen in on...

06:11.400 --> 06:12.693
I got the Memaris.

06:12.860 --> 06:15.196
<i>Did you see Stan
filling his pockets with shrimp?</i>

06:15.363 --> 06:17.532
<i>I mean, what kind of
cheap bastard does that?</i>

06:17.698 --> 06:20.159
Bob, no.

06:20.326 --> 06:22.578
<i>Why does Stan
always show us his class ring?</i>

06:22.745 --> 06:26.791
<i>Because when stupid people get nervous,
they talk about shiny things.</i>

06:28.251 --> 06:30.295
But gay men are never catty.

06:30.462 --> 06:32.339
What's happening?
Somebody must like me.

06:32.506 --> 06:35.467
<i>And what kind of an idiot
points a loaded gun at a child?</i>

06:35.634 --> 06:37.678
<i>I made lemonade and fudge.</i>

06:37.845 --> 06:40.681
<i>I know, Johnny.
But please, Mommy's almost there.</i>

06:40.848 --> 06:43.976
<i>All Smith does is talk,
he doesn 't know how to listen.</i>

06:44.143 --> 06:45.978
<i>- He's a pig-headed...
- No-neck...</i>

06:46.145 --> 06:47.396
<i>Jackass.</i>

06:47.563 --> 06:48.648
Oh, my God.

06:48.815 --> 06:51.734
Oh, my God,
I'm not beloved, I'm hated.

06:51.901 --> 06:55.947
I'm surrounded by people who hate me.
It's our wedding all over again.

06:56.114 --> 06:58.116
Except I'm you.

07:02.954 --> 07:04.622
My God, everybody hates me.

07:04.789 --> 07:07.626
I feel like a Jew
outside of New York or Los Angeles.

07:07.793 --> 07:09.837
Hey, why don't we
throw a party of our own?

07:10.004 --> 07:12.381
You know, to show them
they're wrong about you.

07:12.548 --> 07:15.176
That's a brilliant idea.
We should form a think tank.

07:15.342 --> 07:19.346
What, with your ability to come up with
ideas and my ability to assess their worth.

07:19.513 --> 07:23.225
- We should call it Thoughts Unlimited.
- That's terrible.

07:25.103 --> 07:28.607
All right, Steve, we are moments away
from getting a lifetime supply...

07:28.773 --> 07:30.942
...of whatever the hell it is
they sell here.

07:31.109 --> 07:33.570
Awesome.
So here's what I think we should do.

07:33.737 --> 07:35.488
You go...

07:35.655 --> 07:39.576
You don't get paid to think,
you get paid to look honest.

07:39.743 --> 07:41.870
Cup of your hottest coffee, please.

07:42.037 --> 07:44.624
Remember,
you're the face, I'm the brain.

07:44.790 --> 07:48.210
Oh, this cup is irresponsibly hot.

07:48.377 --> 07:51.213
Oh, my face!

07:53.049 --> 07:54.091
Exactly.

08:12.486 --> 08:15.656
Don't worry, buddy,
we'll get you fixed up.

08:21.079 --> 08:22.705
This wasn't properly anchored.

08:30.797 --> 08:33.549
There. This should show people
you're not cheap.

08:33.716 --> 08:37.596
I put out lobster, caviar,
and a bowl of $ 10 bills.

08:37.763 --> 08:41.350
Nice work. What kind of caviar?
See? See what I did there?

08:41.517 --> 08:44.937
I asked a follow-up question.
I'm listening.

08:45.104 --> 08:47.648
Here they are. Wish me luck.

08:48.273 --> 08:51.610
Hello, everybody. Please, come in
and talk about yourselves at length.

08:51.777 --> 08:54.071
- Oh, shrimp.
- And caviar.

08:54.238 --> 08:56.282
Is there a dip for the $ 10 bills?

08:56.449 --> 08:57.826
Johnny.

08:58.868 --> 09:01.996
It's an éclair. Delicious, not deadly.

09:02.163 --> 09:03.498
We're having fun now.

09:03.665 --> 09:06.876
So, Lisa, who is this
handsome new piece of arm candy?

09:07.043 --> 09:08.712
This is Björn, my Norwegian lover.

09:08.878 --> 09:11.589
We hooked up at the ARCO
while the kids were pumping gas.

09:11.756 --> 09:14.427
How interesting I find that.
Please, continue.

09:14.593 --> 09:19.140
Well, I go inside, and there's this
gorgeous guy buying a pretzel.

09:19.473 --> 09:21.475
Now, you might notice
he smells like fish.

09:21.642 --> 09:25.229
Well, that's because
his father owns a herring farm.

09:25.396 --> 09:28.524
People don't realize
there are over 300 types of herring.

09:28.691 --> 09:32.821
The blue herring, the light-blue herring,
the medium-blue herring...

09:32.988 --> 09:35.991
...which is really only
a juvenile light-blue herring...

09:36.366 --> 09:37.742
Well, thanks for the party.

09:37.909 --> 09:41.746
Thank you for the fascinating story about
the shoes you couldn't decide between.

09:41.913 --> 09:43.331
Let me know how it turns out.

09:43.498 --> 09:44.583
- Thanks again.
- Bye.

09:44.749 --> 09:47.085
- That was nice of you.
- Thank you for coming.

09:47.252 --> 09:49.881
- I think you did it.
- I know I did it.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.967
I am the hit of the neighborhood.
Our neighbors love me.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.013
<i>- Stan Smith is...
- Still a complete jackass.</i>

09:57.180 --> 09:59.807
Bob, no.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.893
<i>He kept asking about my shoes.</i>

10:02.059 --> 10:05.062
<i>I mean, come on,
I'm wearing other things.</i>

10:05.563 --> 10:07.899
<i>And the way Stan stared at me
when I was talking.</i>

10:08.066 --> 10:10.235
<i>Like he'd never eaten
a lavender herring.</i>

10:11.111 --> 10:14.907
<i>Smith was so phony.
Like my children 's love.</i>

10:15.073 --> 10:19.119
- Turn it off. Turn that thing off.
- Oh, Stan, who cares what they think?

10:19.286 --> 10:22.623
- I love you, and that's all that matters.
- To you, maybe.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.125
Francine,
I will make these people like me.

10:25.292 --> 10:29.214
As God as my witness,
I will be beloved.

10:29.714 --> 10:33.676
Attention, neighbors. An important part
of any relationship is vulnerability...

10:33.843 --> 10:37.931
...so I will now share with you painful
and embarrassing chapters from my life.

10:38.097 --> 10:42.727
Age 7: I put my little cousin's doll
in a river and watched it float away.

10:42.894 --> 10:45.856
When she cried,
I called her "Little Sally Crypants".

10:46.023 --> 10:47.274
I don't know why I did it.

10:47.441 --> 10:50.361
Age 11: When my parents
wouldn't let me have a fourth cupcake...

10:50.527 --> 10:52.196
...I burned down their summer home.

10:52.363 --> 10:56.033
When caught, I framed my favorite
grandfather. I don't know why I did it.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.370
Age 15:
I put a bunch of flies in a blender...

11:00.120 --> 11:02.666
Attention, neighbors. It's me again.

11:02.832 --> 11:05.293
I found a book
at Barnes & Noble that says:

11:05.460 --> 11:09.422
"The path to true friendship
is paved with selfless generosity."

11:09.589 --> 11:12.884
Accordingly, I am now going to paint
all of your houses at once.

11:17.889 --> 11:21.560
That's lead-based paint.
Don't let your kids lick it.

11:25.106 --> 11:27.858
Hey, hey, hey, everybody,
it's your favorite neighbor.

11:28.025 --> 11:29.902
Oh, my God, it's him.

11:30.069 --> 11:33.030
Hey, look at that dangerous pool.

11:33.197 --> 11:36.784
Johnny, happy birthday, dude.

11:36.951 --> 11:40.831
- Are these rocks?
- Not just any rocks, pocket rocks.

11:40.998 --> 11:43.792
Keep them in your pockets.
They only work in your pockets.

11:43.959 --> 11:46.920
That's how you know you got
pocket rocks. Happy birthday.

11:47.087 --> 11:51.675
Oh, my God. Johnny fell in the pool
playing with his new birthday present.

11:51.842 --> 11:54.302
Whoever saves him
will certainly be beloved.

11:54.469 --> 11:59.600
For he who is not afraid to risk life
and limb for a neighbor in need...

12:00.143 --> 12:02.353
My baby.

12:02.520 --> 12:06.399
Unhand that child,
underwater molester clown.

12:06.566 --> 12:07.775
You need to go.

12:10.361 --> 12:14.115
Hi. I have to sell my house
because my neighbors don't like me.

12:14.282 --> 12:15.826
Yes, that's the only reason.

12:15.993 --> 12:18.662
I guess you and I
have different definitions of "silly".

12:18.829 --> 12:22.583
Remind me never to go to the circus with
you, we'd have nothing to talk about.

12:22.750 --> 12:25.753
- Where are you guys going?
- Taking Maggie for a long weekend...

12:25.919 --> 12:29.590
...to the CIA beach house.
- The CIA has a beach house?

12:29.757 --> 12:32.634
We do now. Congress is letting the CIA
seize any property...

12:32.801 --> 12:36.139
...that could help in the war on terror.
- This is cool with Bullock?

12:36.306 --> 12:38.391
Don't know.
Nobody's seen him for days.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.394
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, listen to me.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.814
Charlie? Charlie?
What's your name again?

12:44.981 --> 12:48.318
Wow, so we can just seize
anybody's house we want?

13:06.754 --> 13:08.380
Hey, what are you doing?

13:08.547 --> 13:11.384
CIA. Your house has been seized
to help in the war on terror.

13:11.551 --> 13:13.845
How's our house gonna help
in the war on terror?

13:14.012 --> 13:16.181
That's classified,
but it's gonna help a lot.

13:16.348 --> 13:18.642
There should be
no more terror at all very soon.

13:18.808 --> 13:22.896
You will each receive a coupon good for
a five-night stay at the Cornfield Motel.

13:23.063 --> 13:28.193
The Cornfield Motel, providing you
all the comfort and elegance of corn.

13:28.694 --> 13:31.781
Honey, good news.
The neighbors no longer hate me.

13:31.948 --> 13:33.991
Because they're no longer
our neighbors.

13:34.158 --> 13:36.911
In other words,
there goes the neighborhood.

13:37.078 --> 13:39.455
Ordinarily,
that would have racist implications...

13:39.622 --> 13:42.333
...but I've actually
done something far worse.

13:48.799 --> 13:51.718
- You evicted all our neighbors?
- It's their fault.

13:51.885 --> 13:53.011
I tried to be nice.

13:53.178 --> 13:56.265
I bared my soul, I painted their houses,
I drowned their kids.

13:56.431 --> 13:59.184
Dad, you can't just uproot people
from their homes.

13:59.351 --> 14:01.603
She's right, you're insane.
This man is insane.

14:01.770 --> 14:05.984
Oh, am I?
Would an insane man try to drink you?

14:06.150 --> 14:08.403
Gross. Gross.

14:08.569 --> 14:10.822
- Stan, stop it.
- He called me crazy.

14:10.989 --> 14:14.033
Nobody criticizes me. Nobody.

14:14.701 --> 14:18.913
Honey, no one's criticizing you.
We're your family.

14:19.080 --> 14:23.293
Well, things can happen to families too.
Bad things.

14:28.465 --> 14:31.468
No, no, I'm just locked out.
I don't know how I got out here.

14:32.386 --> 14:35.180
Steve, go put on a tie.
We're going to the Four Seasons...

14:35.347 --> 14:37.725
...so you can drink kerosene
and puke on yourself.

14:37.891 --> 14:41.646
- Roger, I've got an idea. We...
- Face, face, face.

14:41.813 --> 14:45.483
I know. I know I'm not the brain,
but just hear me out.

14:45.650 --> 14:49.154
Instead of me getting my ass kicked
in all these nickel-and-dime cons...

14:49.320 --> 14:53.241
...what do you say we go for
one big score and then call it quits?

14:53.408 --> 14:57.162
If we can pull this off,
we'll each make 50 grand.

14:57.328 --> 14:58.538
Fifty grand?

14:58.705 --> 15:02.668
Face, that's catch-your-dream money,
that's what that is. So what's the scam?

15:05.504 --> 15:08.340
You must be the Hannigans.
Maurice Barnes, All-Star Realty.

15:08.507 --> 15:09.925
You're gonna love this house.

15:10.092 --> 15:12.094
Here you go.
I'm also a singer-songwriter.

15:12.261 --> 15:14.597
I'm playing at Sarah's Coffeehouse
next Thursday.

15:14.764 --> 15:18.101
Plugging my new self-released CD...
Real soul-searching, heavy stuff.

15:18.268 --> 15:22.022
Buy the house, don't buy, you're comped.
Don't let it influence your decision.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.691
My mother killed herself when I was 12...
Track four.

15:24.858 --> 15:28.904
One of the paramedics molested me on the
way to the morgue, it's in the liner notes.

15:29.070 --> 15:31.364
Come in, come in.
Now, I love these built-ins.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.408
You don't see these anymore.

15:33.909 --> 15:35.285
And these are walls.

15:35.452 --> 15:38.247
You know when people say
the walls are closing in on them?

15:38.414 --> 15:41.459
Well, this is what they're referring to.
So do we have a deal?

15:43.085 --> 15:45.505
Why is there a half-eaten meal
on the table?

15:45.671 --> 15:47.465
It almost looks like the occupants...

15:47.632 --> 15:50.426
...were forcibly dragged out
in the middle of dinner.

15:50.593 --> 15:52.678
Oh, you can do the kitchen
however you want.

15:52.845 --> 15:56.517
- Oh, look, another serious buyer.
- Hello, I'm another serious buyer.

15:56.683 --> 15:59.686
But you're so young. How could you
possibly afford this house?

15:59.853 --> 16:01.605
<i>Remember the kid from Jerry Maguire?</i>

16:01.772 --> 16:02.815
- Yes.
- Of course.

16:02.981 --> 16:05.692
Well, he pays me to call hotels
before his arrival...

16:05.859 --> 16:08.987
...to ensure they have pillows
that can support his massive head.

16:09.154 --> 16:10.239
I do quite well.

16:10.405 --> 16:15.620
Which is why I'm prepared to offer you
$99,000 and not a penny more.

16:15.787 --> 16:18.623
Oh, yeah? Let me see the cash.

16:18.790 --> 16:21.918
I don't need to see the cash.
Well, Hannigan, what's it gonna be?

16:22.085 --> 16:25.630
You gonna offer me 100k, or are you
gonna let Jonathan Lipnicki's bitch...

16:25.797 --> 16:28.800
...make you look like a punk
in front of your hot wife?

16:28.967 --> 16:30.469
Well, are you?

16:34.890 --> 16:38.227
What are we gonna do about Dad?
He's completely lost it.

16:38.394 --> 16:41.730
If he hears us,
he'll send us all to the Cornfield Motel.

16:41.897 --> 16:45.109
Well, we have to do something.
We can't keep living like this.

16:45.276 --> 16:48.905
<i>Oh, mein Gott!
He has heard everything.</i>

16:49.072 --> 16:50.574
You were criticizing me.

16:50.740 --> 16:53.493
And if you criticize me,
then you don't love me.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.954
And if you don't love me,
then you must hate me.

16:56.121 --> 16:57.664
Just like the neighbors.

16:57.831 --> 17:02.877
Oh, no!

17:03.962 --> 17:06.632
Stan, you can't do this.

17:06.799 --> 17:10.136
Oh, good, criticize me more.
That worked well the first time.

17:10.303 --> 17:14.098
I am a rock. I am an island.
I am incontinent.

17:14.265 --> 17:16.976
Get it? Sounds like continent.

17:26.278 --> 17:29.072
Jeez, Frank, it's called a breath mint.

17:35.329 --> 17:40.792
- Did that couple's check clear?
- Yep. Fifty-grand for you, 50 for me.

17:42.210 --> 17:45.131
You realize we can't
speak to one another for a long time?

17:45.298 --> 17:46.382
Don't try to find me.

17:46.549 --> 17:51.095
But If I hear that you die before me,
I'll leave a rose on your grave every year.

17:51.262 --> 17:53.639
Well, every five years.

17:54.057 --> 17:55.266
Once.

17:55.433 --> 17:56.934
I'll think of you.

17:57.101 --> 17:58.811
I won't.

18:14.703 --> 18:16.997
We are so pleased
you have chosen to purchase...

18:17.164 --> 18:19.542
...your own restaurant
in the Señor Toad's family.

18:19.709 --> 18:21.669
Ribbit. It's like "olé".

18:21.836 --> 18:24.339
Anyways, here is your official
Señor Toad sombrero...

18:24.506 --> 18:27.592
...and your complimentary
fire extinguisher that shoots tequila.

18:27.759 --> 18:30.095
Is this heaven?

18:30.261 --> 18:31.471
No, it's Mexico.

18:31.638 --> 18:33.890
That makes sense,
because it smells like Mexico.

18:34.057 --> 18:36.893
Now, all that remains
is your franchise fee of $50,000.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.146
Of course.

18:40.314 --> 18:43.609
This is just a photocopy
of a 14-year-old boy's butt.

18:45.110 --> 18:47.863
What is the meaning of this?

18:48.364 --> 18:52.368
<i>"Dear Roger, you taught me well.
Perhaps a little too well.</i>

18:52.535 --> 18:57.457
<i>You told me that everyone's either
a sucker, a crook, or just plain greedy.</i>

18:57.624 --> 18:59.751
<i>I guess you were all three.</i>

18:59.918 --> 19:02.754
<i>As for you, old friend,
I think you'll like Mexico.</i>

19:02.921 --> 19:06.216
<i>It's a lot like America,
on Opposite Day.</i>

19:06.383 --> 19:08.927
<i>Adios, sucker. The Brain. "</i>

19:09.094 --> 19:12.556
So the face becomes the brain...

19:12.722 --> 19:15.643
...and the brain is stuck in Mexico
without a penny.

19:15.810 --> 19:17.937
I must plan my next move carefully.

19:27.822 --> 19:30.283
This is how life should be.

19:30.449 --> 19:32.536
No one to criticize me.

19:32.703 --> 19:34.496
No one to disagree.

19:34.663 --> 19:36.331
No one to...

19:37.374 --> 19:39.334
Help me.

20:01.858 --> 20:04.902
Johnny, you saved my life.

20:05.069 --> 20:08.573
- I thought you hated me.
- What? Why would you think that?

20:08.741 --> 20:11.243
I heard what you said about me.
I was eavesdropping.

20:11.410 --> 20:15.581
I heard what everyone said.
It was uncomplimentary.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.293
Mr. Smith, people talk smack
about each other all the time.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.546
- You're not the only one.
- I'm not?

20:22.713 --> 20:24.089
Come with me.

20:28.053 --> 20:30.221
<i>I just ran into Hallworthy
at the ice machine.</i>

20:30.388 --> 20:34.392
<i>He had food on his neck.
How long has that been there?</i>

20:35.310 --> 20:37.604
<i>That Linda Memari
is one hairy woman.</i>

20:37.771 --> 20:40.023
<i>I felt like Jane Goodall
just talking to her.</i>

20:40.190 --> 20:41.900
<i>Lisa Collins is such a skank.</i>

20:42.067 --> 20:44.527
<i>Let's make a list of people
she hasn 't slept with.</i>

20:44.694 --> 20:46.989
<i>You, me.</i>

20:47.323 --> 20:48.908
<i>Let's go to dinner.</i>

20:49.408 --> 20:51.619
Wow, Johnny, you're right.

20:51.786 --> 20:55.039
Everyone hates everyone.
So I'm not despised.

20:55.206 --> 20:57.666
No more than anyone else.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.127
You know,
you're a real bright kid, Johnny.

21:00.294 --> 21:03.089
I gotta say, I've lived in this
neighborhood a long time...

21:03.882 --> 21:07.844
Dead in the cornfield, crows pecking out
your eyes. Mama can't find you for weeks.

21:08.011 --> 21:11.765
- You're an ass, Mr. Smith.
- And you're funny looking.

21:12.265 --> 21:14.810
We're pals.

21:51.265 --> 21:53.350
