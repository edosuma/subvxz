01:03.250 --> 01:05.050
All right, that's it.

01:08.690 --> 01:10.330
One, two, three.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.410
Are you sure you're 18?

01:29.690 --> 01:31.130
Why, do I look older?

01:39.850 --> 01:41.050
Alberta Scrubb?

01:41.330 --> 01:45.210
That's a typographical error. It's supposed to be Albert A. Scrubb.

01:45.490 --> 01:46.570
Edmund...

01:46.570 --> 01:48.690
you're supposed to be helping me with the groceries.

01:53.970 --> 01:55.330
Better luck next time, eh, squirt?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.690
Squirt.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.970
He barely had two years on me.

02:06.250 --> 02:10.610
I am a king. I have fought wars and I have led armies.

02:11.050 --> 02:12.210
Not in this world.

02:12.490 --> 02:15.450
Yeah, instead I am stuck here, doing battle...

02:15.730 --> 02:17.930
with Eustace Clarence Scrubb.

02:18.210 --> 02:20.770
If anyone so deserved a name.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.210
What are you doing?

02:25.370 --> 02:26.210
Nothing.

02:27.290 --> 02:28.610
Come on then.

02:35.770 --> 02:38.650
Dear diary, it is now day 253...

02:39.010 --> 02:42.450
since my wretched cousins Edmund and Lucy invaded our house.

02:42.770 --> 02:45.090
Not sure how much longer I can cope living with them...

02:45.370 --> 02:47.450
having to share my things.

02:47.770 --> 02:51.210
If only one could treat relatives like one treats insects...

02:51.530 --> 02:53.290
all my problems would be solved.

02:53.530 --> 02:56.930
I could simply put them in a jar or pin them to my wall.

02:57.330 --> 03:00.090
I am home. Hello.

03:00.450 --> 03:04.090
Note to self, investigate legal ramifications...

03:04.450 --> 03:06.490
of impaling relatives.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.490
That concludes the war news from the Western Front.

03:11.770 --> 03:14.050
Hello, Uncle Harold. I tried to find some carrots...

03:14.330 --> 03:16.090
but all they had were turnips again.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.050
Shall I start making soup?

03:18.330 --> 03:20.090
Aunt Alberta's on her way home.

03:23.450 --> 03:24.330
Uncle Harold?

03:26.210 --> 03:28.210
Father. Edmund's making faces at you.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.650
Why, you little--

03:31.930 --> 03:33.050
Father, he's going to hit me.

03:33.330 --> 03:34.290
Edmund, look.

03:34.770 --> 03:36.610
It's from Susan.

03:36.890 --> 03:38.170
I do wish you were here with us.

03:38.890 --> 03:42.330
It's been such an adventure, but nothing like our times in Narnia.

03:43.330 --> 03:45.170
America is very exciting...

03:45.490 --> 03:48.930
except we never see Father. He works so very hard.

03:49.210 --> 03:50.090
I was invited...

03:50.330 --> 03:53.490
"...to the British Consul's tea party this week by a naval officer...

03:53.770 --> 03:55.490
who happens to be very handsome.

03:56.010 --> 03:57.890
I think he fancies me." Hmm.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.610
"It seems the Germans have made the crossing difficult right now.

04:02.010 --> 04:03.090
Times are hard.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.450
Mother hopes you both won't mind another few months in Cambridge."

04:07.770 --> 04:09.050
Another few months?

04:09.050 --> 04:11.050
How will we survive?

04:11.290 --> 04:12.370
You're lucky...

04:12.650 --> 04:16.089
at least you have got your own room. I am stuck with mullet mouth.

04:16.410 --> 04:19.050
Susan and Peter are the lucky ones.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.610
Off on adventures.

04:20.850 --> 04:23.650
Yeah, they're the eldest and we're the youngest.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.850
We don't matter as much.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.730
Do you think I look anything like Susan?

04:30.850 --> 04:31.650
Lucy...

04:32.290 --> 04:34.290
have you seen this ship before?

04:34.610 --> 04:38.170
Yes. It's very Narnian-looking, isn't it?

04:38.530 --> 04:39.970
Yeah.

04:39.970 --> 04:42.530
Just another reminder that we're here and not there.

04:43.170 --> 04:45.850
There once were two orphans Who wasted their time

04:46.970 --> 04:48.650
Believing in Narnian nursery rhymes

04:48.650 --> 04:50.410
Please let me hit him.
- No.

04:50.650 --> 04:53.490
Don't you ever knock? It's my house. I will do as I please.

04:53.770 --> 04:54.730
You're just guests.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.970
What's so fascinating about that picture anyway?

04:59.290 --> 05:00.410
It's hideous.

05:00.650 --> 05:02.170
You won't see it from the other side of the door.

05:03.410 --> 05:05.490
Edmund, it looks like the water is actually moving.

05:06.290 --> 05:07.090
What rubbish.

05:07.090 --> 05:08.410
See? That's what happens...

05:08.730 --> 05:11.290
when you read all those fanciful novels and fairy tales of yours.

05:11.650 --> 05:13.410
There once was a boy called Eustace

05:13.730 --> 05:16.090
Who read books Full of facts that were useless

05:16.650 --> 05:17.770
People who read fairy tales...

05:18.050 --> 05:20.610
are always the sort who become a hideous burden to people like me...

05:21.330 --> 05:23.210
who read books with real information.

05:23.530 --> 05:24.650
"Hideous burden"?

05:25.530 --> 05:28.170
I haven't seen you lift a finger since we have been here.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.730
I have a mind to tell your father you stole Aunt Alberta's sweets.

05:32.970 --> 05:34.330
- Liar.
- Oh, really?

05:34.330 --> 05:35.970
Edmund, the painting.

05:36.210 --> 05:38.850
I found them under your bed, and you know what?

05:39.170 --> 05:40.490
I licked every one of them.

05:40.730 --> 05:43.090
Ugh. I am infected with you.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.050
What's going on here?

05:49.050 --> 05:51.170
- Lucy, do you think--?
- It's some kind of trick.

05:51.530 --> 05:52.850
Stop it or I will tell mother.

05:53.090 --> 05:54.290
Mother.

05:54.530 --> 05:55.650
Mother.

05:58.330 --> 05:59.930
I will just smash the rotten thing.

06:00.410 --> 06:02.170
No, Eustace. No.

06:02.410 --> 06:03.490
We can't stop it.

06:03.730 --> 06:04.730
Get off me. Get off.

06:04.970 --> 06:06.730
Let go of it, Eustace. Put it down.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.770
- Get off it.
- Let go.

06:36.490 --> 06:37.610
Edmund.

06:39.050 --> 06:39.930
Edmund.

06:39.930 --> 06:41.930
What's happening?

06:42.410 --> 06:43.850
Where are we?

06:46.090 --> 06:47.410
Eustace, swim.

06:48.090 --> 06:49.290
What's going on?

06:49.610 --> 06:50.850
Eustace, come on.

06:51.090 --> 06:52.290
Come on, move.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.610
Keep swimming.

06:56.970 --> 06:58.330
Edmund.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.090
It's all right. I have got you.

07:07.170 --> 07:08.170
Caspian.

07:08.410 --> 07:09.770
Lucy.

07:10.050 --> 07:11.210
Edmund, it's Caspian.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.850
It's all right, boys. You're safe now.

07:14.170 --> 07:15.090
Are we in Narnia?

07:15.090 --> 07:16.850
Yes, you're in Narnia.

07:17.090 --> 07:18.210
I don't want to go.

07:18.490 --> 07:22.530
I want to go back to England. I am going back to England.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.330
Hold on.

07:44.290 --> 07:45.770
That was thrilling.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.930
How in the world did you end up here?

07:48.170 --> 07:49.530
I have no idea.

07:49.530 --> 07:50.970
Caspian.

07:52.410 --> 07:53.410
Edmund.

07:53.410 --> 07:54.530
It's great to see you.

07:54.850 --> 07:56.850
Great to see you. Didn't you call for us?

07:57.170 --> 07:59.730
No. Not this time.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.170
Well, whatever the case, I am just glad to be here.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.970
- Now calm down, sir.
- Get that thing off me.

08:07.290 --> 08:08.410
Get that thing off me.

08:11.650 --> 08:12.850
Reepicheep.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.490
Oh. Your Majesties.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.610
Hello, Reep. What a pleasure.

08:18.850 --> 08:20.610
The pleasure is all mine, sir.

08:20.850 --> 08:23.850
But first, what to do about this hysterical interloper?

08:25.530 --> 08:26.730
That giant rat thing...

08:27.050 --> 08:28.170
just tried to claw my face off.

08:28.410 --> 08:29.650
I was merely trying...

08:29.650 --> 08:31.170
to expel the water...

08:31.490 --> 08:32.409
from your lungs, sir.

08:32.650 --> 08:35.929
It talked. Did you see? Did anyone just hear that? It just talked.

08:36.250 --> 08:38.770
He always talks. It's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.370
The moment there is nothing to be said, Your Highness...

08:41.650 --> 08:44.049
I promise you, I will not say it.

08:44.370 --> 08:47.530
I don't know what kind of prank this is, but I want to wake up right now.

08:48.170 --> 08:50.010
Perhaps we could throw him back?

08:52.050 --> 08:52.890
Edmund.

08:54.810 --> 08:57.650
I demand to know, just where in the blazes am I?

08:57.930 --> 08:59.370
You're on the Dawn Treader...

08:59.370 --> 09:02.170
the finest ship in Narnia's navy.

09:07.930 --> 09:09.170
Was it something I said?

09:10.410 --> 09:11.410
See to him, will you?

09:11.650 --> 09:13.170
Your Majesty.

09:16.250 --> 09:17.170
Men...

09:19.290 --> 09:21.010
behold our castaways...

09:22.530 --> 09:26.250
Edmund the Just and Lucy the Valliant...

09:26.530 --> 09:29.410
high King and Queen of Narnia.

09:58.570 --> 09:59.690
Aslan.

10:07.130 --> 10:08.170
Look...

10:08.410 --> 10:10.370
Susan's bow and arrows.

10:10.650 --> 10:11.370
Lucy.

10:13.450 --> 10:15.130
My healing cordial...

10:15.530 --> 10:16.890
and dagger.

10:17.170 --> 10:18.410
Oh, may I?

10:18.690 --> 10:20.290
Of course, they're yours.

10:20.290 --> 10:21.530
Peter's sword.

10:21.770 --> 10:22.770
Yes.

10:23.770 --> 10:25.890
I looked after it as promised.

10:27.170 --> 10:29.170
Here, hold it if you wish.

10:29.530 --> 10:31.250
No, no, it's yours.

10:31.770 --> 10:33.290
Peter gave it to you.

10:34.570 --> 10:37.170
I did save this for you though.

10:42.770 --> 10:43.930
Thanks.

10:46.050 --> 10:47.410
Since you left, the Giants of the North...

10:47.650 --> 10:48.930
surrendered unconditionally...

10:49.170 --> 10:52.170
then we defeated the Calormen armies at the Great Desert.

10:52.450 --> 10:54.130
There is peace across all of Narnia.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.290
Peace?

10:55.530 --> 10:56.690
In just three years.

10:57.370 --> 10:59.890
And have you found yourself a queen in those three years?

11:00.890 --> 11:03.650
No. Not one to compare with your sister.

11:04.010 --> 11:05.770
Hang on. If there are no wars to fight...

11:06.050 --> 11:09.170
and no one is in trouble, then why are we here?

11:09.530 --> 11:12.130
It's a good question. I have been asking myself the same thing.

11:12.690 --> 11:14.010
So where are we sailing to?

11:14.650 --> 11:16.410
Before I took back the throne from my uncle...

11:16.690 --> 11:20.410
he tried to kill my father's closest friends and most loyal supporters.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.570
The seven lords of Telmar.

11:27.370 --> 11:28.530
They fled to the Lone Islands.

11:30.370 --> 11:31.650
No one has heard from them since.

11:33.770 --> 11:35.770
So you think something has happened to them?

11:36.050 --> 11:39.050
Well, if it has, it's my duty to find out.

11:41.050 --> 11:43.770
Well, what's east of the Lone Islands?

11:44.050 --> 11:45.370
Uncharted waters.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.650
Things you can barely imagine.

11:48.930 --> 11:51.130
Tales of sea serpents and worse.

11:53.690 --> 11:54.810
Sea serpents?

11:55.050 --> 11:56.170
All right, Captain...

11:56.410 --> 11:58.450
that's enough of your tall tales.

12:09.410 --> 12:11.770
Where sky and water meet

12:12.050 --> 12:14.410
Where the waves grow ever sweet

12:14.650 --> 12:18.410
Doubt not, you Reepicheep

12:19.370 --> 12:21.770
To find all that you seek

12:22.130 --> 12:24.810
There is the Utter East Doubt not--

12:25.130 --> 12:27.010
That's pretty. Oh.

12:27.290 --> 12:28.810
Thank you.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.290
A dryad sung it to me when I was just a mouseling.

12:32.570 --> 12:35.930
I can't divine the meaning, but I have never forgotten the words.

12:36.290 --> 12:38.290
What do you think is past the Lone Islands, Reep?

12:38.770 --> 12:42.530
Well, I have been told the furthest east one can sail is to the end of the world.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.050
Aslan's country.

12:44.530 --> 12:46.370
Do you really believe there's such a place?

12:46.930 --> 12:49.170
Well, we have nothing, if not belief.

12:52.450 --> 12:54.570
Do you think you could actually sail there?

12:54.890 --> 12:57.170
Well, there is only one way of finding that out.

12:57.770 --> 13:00.250
I can only hope I will one day earn the right to see it.

13:01.770 --> 13:03.650
Your Majesty.

13:41.170 --> 13:42.530
Come on.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.170
You have grown stronger, my friend.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.170
Seems I have.

14:08.170 --> 14:11.050
All right, back to work.

14:12.890 --> 14:14.810
- Your Highness.
- Thank you.

14:18.890 --> 14:19.770
Edmund...

14:20.010 --> 14:21.290
do you think if we keep sailing...

14:21.530 --> 14:22.650
to the end of the world...

14:22.890 --> 14:26.050
we will just... tip off the edge?

14:26.410 --> 14:29.410
Don't worry, Lu, we're a long way from there.

14:29.690 --> 14:32.290
I see you're still talking nonsense, the two of you.

14:33.650 --> 14:34.650
Are you feeling better?

14:34.930 --> 14:38.250
Yes, no thanks to you. It's lucky I have an iron constitution.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.050
As effervescent as ever, I see.

14:40.650 --> 14:41.570
Find your sea legs?

14:41.890 --> 14:44.290
Never lost them. Simply dealing with the shock of things.

14:45.250 --> 14:48.930
Mother says I have an acute disposition, due to my intelligence.

14:49.530 --> 14:51.530
I don't think he has a cute anything.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.570
I will have you all know, as soon as we find civilization...

14:54.890 --> 14:57.570
I am contacting the British Consul. Have you all arrested for kidnapping.

14:57.890 --> 14:58.650
Kidnapping, is it?

14:58.930 --> 14:59.930
That's funny.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.650
I thought we saved your life.

15:01.930 --> 15:03.170
You held me against my will.

15:03.410 --> 15:04.170
Ha.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.050
Did I?

15:05.050 --> 15:07.570
In, what I must say, are the most unhygienic quarters.

15:07.890 --> 15:09.050
It's like a zoo down there.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.930
He's quite the complainer, isn't he?

15:11.170 --> 15:12.530
He's just warming up.

15:12.930 --> 15:14.410
Land ho.

15:36.650 --> 15:40.170
The Lone Islands. The port of Narrowhaven.

15:40.410 --> 15:44.050
Strange, not a Narnian flag in sight.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.370
But the Lone Islands have always been Narnia's.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.890
Seems suspicious.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.450
I say we prepare a landing party.

15:56.450 --> 15:57.890
Drinian?

15:58.450 --> 16:00.170
Forgive me, Your Majesty...

16:00.450 --> 16:03.930
but the chain of command starts with King Caspian on this ship.

16:05.450 --> 16:06.290
Right.

16:06.290 --> 16:07.770
We will use longboats.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.530
Drinian, pick some men and come ashore.

16:09.770 --> 16:11.290
Aye. Tavros.

16:12.810 --> 16:17.410
Man the longboats, furl the sail and prepare to drop anchor.

16:31.650 --> 16:35.050
Onward. The thrill of the unknown lies ahead.

16:36.010 --> 16:37.530
Couldn't this have waited till the morning?

16:38.530 --> 16:41.250
There is no honor in turning away from adventure, lad.

16:41.530 --> 16:42.810
Listen.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.050
Where is everyone?

16:46.370 --> 16:47.770
Come on, jelly legs.

16:48.010 --> 16:50.770
I am capable of doing it myself. Oof.

16:52.650 --> 16:54.370
And you're certain he's related by blood?

17:18.810 --> 17:21.490
Reepicheep, stay here with Drinian's men and secure the place.

17:22.569 --> 17:23.849
We will head on.

17:23.849 --> 17:26.970
If we don't come back by dawn, send a party.

17:27.369 --> 17:28.970
Yes, Your Majesty.

17:43.610 --> 17:46.010
Yeah, looks like nobody is in. Do you think we should head back?

17:48.930 --> 17:51.730
Do you want to come here and guard... something?

17:52.890 --> 17:53.970
Ah, yes.

17:55.170 --> 17:56.170
Good idea, cousin.

17:56.930 --> 17:59.450
Very, uh... logical.

18:09.410 --> 18:11.330
I have got it. I have got it. Don't worry.

18:31.810 --> 18:34.170
Uh, I am ready to go when you are.

18:43.730 --> 18:45.650
Who are all these people?

18:45.890 --> 18:48.490
Why have they been crossed out?

18:49.130 --> 18:52.170
It looks like some kind of fee.

18:52.450 --> 18:53.650
Slave traders.

18:58.410 --> 18:59.890
Look out.

19:15.650 --> 19:20.090
Unless you want to hear this one squeal like a girl again...

19:20.970 --> 19:22.370
I'd say you should...

19:22.370 --> 19:23.250
drop your weapons.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.130
Like a girl? Now.

19:26.970 --> 19:28.130
Put it down.

19:29.130 --> 19:30.210
Eustace.

19:30.930 --> 19:32.170
Put them in irons.

19:32.410 --> 19:33.730
Come on. Come here, you.

19:34.410 --> 19:35.090
Ah.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.130
Get your hands off me.

19:36.370 --> 19:37.970
Let's take these two to market.

19:38.210 --> 19:38.930
Let go.

19:39.170 --> 19:40.610
Send those two to the dungeons.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.410
Listen to me, you insolent fool.

19:42.650 --> 19:43.890
I am your king.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.370
You're going to pay for that.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.090
Actually...

19:49.930 --> 19:51.650
someone else is going to pay...

19:54.090 --> 19:56.010
for all of you.

19:56.330 --> 19:58.250
No. Edmund. Edmund.
- Lucy.

19:58.890 --> 20:00.970
No. Edmund.

20:10.170 --> 20:11.650
You all right?

20:13.210 --> 20:14.170
Yeah.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.490
It's hopeless.

20:21.010 --> 20:22.650
You will never get out.

20:24.450 --> 20:25.890
Who's there?

20:26.170 --> 20:28.610
Nobody. Just a voice...

20:28.890 --> 20:30.410
in my head.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.090
Lord Bern?

20:45.610 --> 20:49.890
Perhaps once, but I am no longer deserving of that title.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.170
Is he one of the seven?

21:01.090 --> 21:02.010
Your face...

21:03.490 --> 21:05.650
You remind me of a king I once loved well.

21:06.610 --> 21:07.690
That man was my father.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.010
Oh, my lord.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.610
Please forgive me.
- No, please.

21:13.970 --> 21:15.130
Please.

21:16.810 --> 21:17.490
No.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.730
No.

21:20.130 --> 21:20.850
Helaine.

21:21.090 --> 21:21.890
- Mummy.
- No.

21:23.010 --> 21:24.970
Helaine.

21:26.690 --> 21:28.010
- Mummy.
- Please.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.490
Mummy.

21:32.130 --> 21:33.410
Get back.

21:34.170 --> 21:36.410
- Mummy.
- Stay with Daddy.

21:36.730 --> 21:39.010
Don't worry. I will find you.

21:39.490 --> 21:40.930
Mummy.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.090
No.

21:53.450 --> 21:54.810
Where are they taking them?

21:55.450 --> 21:56.810
Keep watching.

22:26.450 --> 22:27.730
What happened?

22:27.970 --> 22:30.010
It's a sacrifice.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.730
Where did they go?

22:32.370 --> 22:33.570
No one knows.

22:34.330 --> 22:37.650
The mist was first seen in the east.

22:38.170 --> 22:41.450
Reports of fishermen and sailors disappearing out at sea.

22:41.970 --> 22:44.130
We lords made a pact...

22:44.410 --> 22:46.890
to find the source of the mist to destroy it.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.930
They each set sail...

22:50.170 --> 22:52.170
but none came back.

22:56.810 --> 22:59.970
You see, if they don't sell you to the slave traders...

23:00.370 --> 23:01.970
you're likely to be fed to the mist.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.450
We have to find Lucy...

23:05.370 --> 23:06.450
before it's too late.

23:06.450 --> 23:08.410
- I bid 60.
- I bid 80.

23:08.690 --> 23:10.130
100 for the little lady.

23:10.370 --> 23:11.730
120.

23:11.970 --> 23:12.810
150.

23:13.930 --> 23:14.810
Any more bids?

23:18.970 --> 23:20.130
Sold.

23:20.490 --> 23:21.450
Ah.

23:21.690 --> 23:23.370
Come on, move.

23:23.650 --> 23:24.370
Move.

23:24.650 --> 23:25.490
And now...

23:25.490 --> 23:26.850
for this...

23:26.850 --> 23:28.450
fine specimen...

23:28.850 --> 23:31.130
who will kick off the bidding?

23:31.490 --> 23:33.330
Come on now...

23:33.690 --> 23:36.610
he may not look like much but he's strong.

23:36.930 --> 23:38.130
Yeah, he's strong, all right.

23:38.410 --> 23:40.650
Smells like the rear end of a Minotaur.

23:41.570 --> 23:43.410
That is an outrageous lie.

23:44.170 --> 23:46.890
I won the school hygiene award two years running.

23:48.410 --> 23:50.490
Come on, someone make a bid.

23:50.850 --> 23:52.650
I will take them off your hands.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.690
I will take them all off your hands.

23:54.930 --> 23:55.970
For Narnia.

23:56.690 --> 23:57.650
Narnia.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.450
Guards. Guards. Move yourselves.

24:19.090 --> 24:20.650
Thanks, Reep. I knew you'd come.

24:20.930 --> 24:22.010
Your Highness. Ha.

24:29.410 --> 24:30.410
Get the keys.

24:38.690 --> 24:39.930
Keys.

25:15.970 --> 25:19.170
Oh, you're a boat in a magical land. Can't you row yourself?

25:38.970 --> 25:41.170
Oh, God. I hope that wasn't the British Consul.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.810
Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

25:44.810 --> 25:45.930
Hold it.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.130
My wife was taken just this morning.

25:48.410 --> 25:49.250
It's all right, Drinian.

25:49.490 --> 25:50.930
I beg you, take me with you.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.170
Gael.

25:52.170 --> 25:54.970
I want to come. No, Gael, stay with your aunt.

25:55.330 --> 25:58.730
I am a fine sailor. Been on the seas my whole life.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.410
Of course, you must.

26:00.410 --> 26:02.090
Thank you. But, Daddy.

26:02.330 --> 26:03.650
Have I ever not come back?

26:05.890 --> 26:07.730
Now be good.

26:12.930 --> 26:14.330
My king.

26:14.890 --> 26:16.330
My king.

26:20.650 --> 26:25.170
This was given to me by your father. I hid it safely in a cave all these years.

26:25.810 --> 26:26.970
That's an old Narnian sword.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.930
It's from your Golden Age.

26:29.170 --> 26:33.810
There are seven such swords, gifts from Aslan to protect Narnia.

26:35.210 --> 26:37.730
Your father entrusted them to us.

26:38.570 --> 26:40.250
Here, take it.

26:44.210 --> 26:45.730
And may it protect you.

26:55.410 --> 26:56.450
Thank you, my lord.

26:57.610 --> 26:59.330
And we shall find your lost citizens.

27:03.730 --> 27:04.890
Edmund.

27:21.370 --> 27:24.930
Dear diary, there has been an extraordinary turn of events.

27:25.250 --> 27:26.850
I have been abducted by my cousins...

27:27.090 --> 27:30.850
and set adrift in uncharted waters in some ridiculous-looking boat.

27:31.170 --> 27:34.930
What's worse is I share quarters with an obnoxious mouse thing.

27:35.250 --> 27:38.210
And I thought bunking with my cousin was bad enough.

27:38.570 --> 27:40.970
So far, every person I have met in this strange place...

27:41.730 --> 27:44.170
suffers from the most florid delusions.

27:44.930 --> 27:48.330
Chasing green mists and looking for lost lords.

27:48.970 --> 27:50.330
I can only assume that this is...

27:50.570 --> 27:52.610
the result of poor diet.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.730
Or they're all just barking mad.

27:57.130 --> 27:59.330
Cousin Edmund is no exception.

27:59.610 --> 28:02.450
He spends every spare second rubbing that tin sword of his...

28:02.730 --> 28:04.210
like it's some magic lantern.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.010
Poor fool clearly needs a hobby.

28:06.250 --> 28:09.170
It's going to be magnificent. Do they come in a smaller size?

28:10.810 --> 28:11.730
Peeving marmot.

28:12.330 --> 28:14.930
He's even more deluded than my cousin.

28:18.970 --> 28:21.570
In England, we have mouse traps for that sort of thing.

28:23.930 --> 28:26.810
Speaking of food, you don't know where I could get any, do you?

28:27.490 --> 28:30.130
Uh, why are you talking to that bird?

28:31.410 --> 28:33.090
I just naturally assumed you can--

28:34.650 --> 28:36.970
He's talking to birds.

28:37.210 --> 28:38.610
He's mad as a loon, that one.

28:38.850 --> 28:39.690
Yeah.

28:41.410 --> 28:43.690
Shoo. Go on, get off.

29:07.650 --> 29:09.690
Are you aware...

29:09.970 --> 29:13.170
that stealing rations is a capital offense at sea?

29:13.690 --> 29:16.170
Up here.

29:16.850 --> 29:17.930
Oh, you.

29:18.930 --> 29:20.650
Men have been keelhauled for less.

29:20.890 --> 29:21.650
For what?

29:21.890 --> 29:22.850
For treason...

29:22.850 --> 29:24.930
and sneakiness and general nuisancery.

29:25.170 --> 29:28.010
Look, just hand over the orange and we will let the matter pass.

29:28.330 --> 29:29.650
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:29.970 --> 29:31.450
Allow me to cla--

29:31.690 --> 29:33.170
Look, I have had quite enough of you.

29:33.410 --> 29:35.730
Unhand the tail.

29:36.210 --> 29:38.250
The great Aslan himself gave me this tail.

29:38.490 --> 29:39.090
No one...

29:39.330 --> 29:41.730
repeat, no one touches the tail.

29:42.210 --> 29:42.930
Period.

29:43.170 --> 29:44.210
Exclamation mark.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.370
Sorry.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.410
Now, I will have the orange...

29:47.650 --> 29:49.450
then I will have satisfaction.

29:49.690 --> 29:51.410
Please, I am a pacifist.

29:51.650 --> 29:52.450
En garde.

29:58.210 --> 29:59.810
Watch it. Sorry.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.210
Trying to run away?

30:05.570 --> 30:07.010
We're on a boat, you know.

30:07.010 --> 30:08.810
Look, can't we just discuss this?

30:09.690 --> 30:10.930
That was for stealing...

30:11.170 --> 30:12.370
that was for lying...

30:12.730 --> 30:15.410
and that was for good measure.

30:17.410 --> 30:20.330
That's the spirit. We have ourselves a duel.

30:20.610 --> 30:21.930
Catch.

30:22.410 --> 30:23.810
Now, come on.

30:23.810 --> 30:25.450
Take your best shot.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.410
Is that it? Come on, boy.

30:28.170 --> 30:29.410
Focus. Focus.

30:30.250 --> 30:31.850
Yes. Ha.

30:32.610 --> 30:36.170
Stop flapping your wings like a drunken pelican. Poise.

30:36.650 --> 30:37.450
Keep your blade up.

30:37.450 --> 30:38.570
Up, up. That's it.

30:38.570 --> 30:39.410
Now...

30:44.130 --> 30:45.330
Ha-ha-ha. Yah.

30:45.930 --> 30:46.810
Yoo-hoo.

30:46.810 --> 30:48.210
Over here.

30:48.210 --> 30:49.970
Now, lunge with your foot.

30:50.810 --> 30:52.090
Not your left, your right.

30:52.330 --> 30:54.930
Got it? Come on. Be nimble. Be nimble.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.930
It's a dance, boy, a dance.

30:57.170 --> 30:58.850
Come on now, again and again.

30:59.130 --> 31:00.410
That's right, that's right.

31:02.130 --> 31:03.410
Oh, no.

31:10.450 --> 31:11.410
And that...

31:12.410 --> 31:13.410
is that.

31:19.250 --> 31:20.450
Look.

31:22.730 --> 31:23.890
Gael?

31:24.610 --> 31:26.450
What are you doing here?

31:33.210 --> 31:34.410
Here.

31:44.850 --> 31:46.250
Looks like we have an extra...

31:46.490 --> 31:47.930
crew member.

31:55.850 --> 31:56.810
Welcome aboard.

31:56.810 --> 31:58.170
Your Majesty.

31:58.410 --> 31:59.410
Call me Lucy.

31:59.810 --> 32:00.730
Come on.

32:01.490 --> 32:03.090
Come on, look lively.

32:03.410 --> 32:04.690
Back to work.

32:06.850 --> 32:08.130
Good match.

32:08.570 --> 32:10.170
I will make a swordsman of you yet.

32:12.410 --> 32:16.090
Yes, well, if the playing field were a little more even...

32:16.410 --> 32:18.130
it would have been an entirely different result.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.730
Heh-heh-heh. Indeed.

32:33.010 --> 32:34.930
It looks uninhabited.

32:35.170 --> 32:38.690
But if the lords followed the mist east, they would have stopped here.

32:39.010 --> 32:40.930
Could be a trap.

32:41.970 --> 32:43.690
Or it could hold some answers.

32:44.410 --> 32:45.930
Caspian?

32:48.170 --> 32:51.130
We will spend the night on shore. Scour the island in the morning.

32:51.410 --> 32:52.650
Aye, your Majesty.

33:12.370 --> 33:14.650
Seems they have brought a pig.

33:18.850 --> 33:20.930
This one, it's female.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.930
So is this one.

33:27.090 --> 33:29.930
This one reads.

33:30.610 --> 33:31.690
Let's take her.

34:07.250 --> 34:09.250
There is no escape.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.010
- Well put.
- Scary.

34:11.290 --> 34:12.690
Yeah. What are you?

34:12.690 --> 34:15.050
We are terrifying invisible beasts.

34:15.370 --> 34:18.330
If you could see us, you would be really intimidated.

34:18.770 --> 34:21.889
You forgot to mention that we are very large.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.610
Well, what do you want?
- You.

34:24.409 --> 34:25.730
You will do what we ask.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.409
- She will.
- Very clear.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.330
- Well put.
- Yeah.

34:30.449 --> 34:31.290
Or what?

34:31.290 --> 34:32.489
Or death.

34:32.770 --> 34:34.210
Death? Death? Death?

34:34.210 --> 34:37.409
Death. Death. Death.

34:39.250 --> 34:42.409
Well, I wouldn't be much use to you dead, would I?

34:42.810 --> 34:44.050
I hadn't thought of that.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.330
No, you hadn't.

34:45.570 --> 34:46.810
Fair point.

34:46.810 --> 34:50.409
All right, then we will just kill your friends.

34:50.770 --> 34:51.889
Ooh.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.489
Good idea.

34:53.770 --> 34:55.730
What do you want with me?

34:55.969 --> 34:58.210
You will enter the house...

34:58.450 --> 34:59.890
of The Oppressor.

35:00.610 --> 35:01.770
What house?

35:01.770 --> 35:03.530
This one.

35:10.130 --> 35:13.570
Upstairs, you will find The Book of Incantations.

35:13.930 --> 35:17.330
Recite the spell that makes the unseen seen.

35:17.610 --> 35:19.290
Well put, Chief. Well put.

35:19.290 --> 35:20.530
Yeah.

35:20.850 --> 35:22.090
Yeah.

35:23.450 --> 35:25.370
Well, go on. We haven't got all day.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.250
Remember what will happen to your friends.

35:27.530 --> 35:29.010
You have been warned.

35:29.290 --> 35:30.530
Yeah. Yeah.

35:30.810 --> 35:32.050
- Yeah.
- Right.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.370
Right.

35:33.610 --> 35:34.570
Yeah.

35:34.810 --> 35:36.250
Why don't you do it yourselves?

35:36.970 --> 35:38.410
We can't read.

35:38.690 --> 35:41.610
Can't write either, as a matter of fact.

35:41.930 --> 35:43.090
Or add.

35:43.410 --> 35:44.770
Yeah.

35:45.490 --> 35:48.050
Why didn't you just say so?

35:48.410 --> 35:49.930
Beware The Oppressor.

35:50.210 --> 35:51.770
He's very oppressive.

35:52.690 --> 35:55.090
"What makes the unseen seen," got it?

35:55.410 --> 35:56.410
Don't forget.

35:56.410 --> 35:59.050
- Don't forget that.
- Yeah.

36:10.730 --> 36:11.770
Ed.

36:12.930 --> 36:13.970
Ed, wake up.

36:14.690 --> 36:16.250
Wake up, look.

36:25.010 --> 36:26.410
Where's Lucy?

36:26.730 --> 36:28.090
Lucy?

36:28.370 --> 36:29.250
Lucy.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.970
Everybody up.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.050
Get up.

36:32.370 --> 36:33.130
Get up, I said.

36:35.730 --> 36:36.850
This way.

36:36.850 --> 36:38.210
Move, you blackguards.

37:41.290 --> 37:44.730
"With these words Your tongue must sew

37:45.050 --> 37:48.570
For all around there to be snow"

38:38.570 --> 38:40.050
"An infallible spell

38:40.330 --> 38:41.810
To make you she

38:41.810 --> 38:43.810
The beauty you have always wanted to be"

38:55.010 --> 38:56.930
Susan, what's going...

38:58.210 --> 38:59.770
...on?

39:04.370 --> 39:06.250
I am beautiful.

39:18.370 --> 39:19.450
No, wait.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.410
"Make me she, whom I'd agree..."

39:32.690 --> 39:33.970
Lucy.

39:34.890 --> 39:36.210
Lucy.

39:36.210 --> 39:37.410
Aslan?

39:39.050 --> 39:40.570
Aslan?

39:55.770 --> 39:57.930
"A spell to make the unseen seen."

39:59.770 --> 40:02.530
"Like the 'p' in psychology

40:02.850 --> 40:04.890
The 'h' in psychiatry

40:05.130 --> 40:08.210
Invisible ink And the truth in theology

40:08.530 --> 40:09.850
Caspian, Lucy's dagger.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.930
Stop right there or perish.

40:23.330 --> 40:25.930
The spell is complete

40:26.250 --> 40:28.850
Now all is visible"

40:51.250 --> 40:53.410
What sort of creatures are you?
- Big ones...

40:53.770 --> 40:55.890
with the head of a tiger and the body of a...

40:56.450 --> 40:58.010
Different tiger.

40:58.410 --> 41:00.130
You don't want to mess with us.

41:00.570 --> 41:01.530
Or what?

41:01.770 --> 41:04.090
Or I will claw you to death.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.850
And I will ram my tusks right through you.

41:09.130 --> 41:10.730
And I will gnash you with my teeth.

41:10.970 --> 41:13.730
And I will bite you with my fangs. Grrr.

41:13.970 --> 41:16.210
You mean squash us with your fat bellies?

41:16.450 --> 41:17.410
Yes.

41:17.850 --> 41:18.810
Fat bellies?

41:18.810 --> 41:19.890
Tickle us with your toes?

41:23.290 --> 41:25.930
What have you done with my sister, you little pip-squeak?

41:26.770 --> 41:27.890
Now, calm down.

41:27.890 --> 41:29.050
Where is she?

41:29.290 --> 41:31.410
- You better tell him.
- Go on, Chief, tell him.

41:31.690 --> 41:32.730
In the mansion.

41:32.730 --> 41:33.930
What mansion?

41:43.130 --> 41:43.880
Oh.

41:44.810 --> 41:46.290
That mansion.

41:46.810 --> 41:49.050
I am really getting tired of you all leaving me behi--

41:49.370 --> 41:51.810
- It's the pig.
- The pig has come back.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.090
This place just gets weirder and weirder.

41:54.370 --> 41:56.410
- Weird?
- Him calling us weird?

41:57.690 --> 42:01.210
The Oppressor. The Oppressor. The Oppressor.

42:02.370 --> 42:03.330
Lucy.

42:04.290 --> 42:05.410
Your Majesty.

42:06.210 --> 42:08.330
Caspian and Edmund.

42:08.330 --> 42:11.370
This is Coriakin. It's his island.

42:11.690 --> 42:13.130
That's what he thinks.

42:13.370 --> 42:14.850
You have wronged us, magician.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.290
I have not wronged you.

42:17.530 --> 42:19.970
I made you invisible for your own protection.

42:20.290 --> 42:21.130
Protection?

42:21.370 --> 42:23.050
That's oppressive. Oppressor.

42:23.330 --> 42:24.930
I have not oppressed you.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.410
But you could have, if you'd wanted to.

42:27.850 --> 42:28.810
Begone.

42:29.410 --> 42:31.290
It's a spell.

42:31.730 --> 42:33.090
What was that?

42:33.530 --> 42:34.370
Lint.

42:34.930 --> 42:36.090
But don't tell them.

42:39.370 --> 42:40.450
What were those things?

42:40.730 --> 42:42.370
Dufflepuds.

42:42.850 --> 42:44.450
Right, of course. Silly me.

42:47.530 --> 42:50.970
What did you mean when you said you made them invisible for their own good?

42:51.370 --> 42:53.930
It seemed the easiest way to protect them...

42:54.250 --> 42:56.210
from the evil.

42:56.930 --> 42:58.810
You mean the mist?

42:59.730 --> 43:02.450
I mean what lies behind the mist.

43:21.090 --> 43:22.490
That's quite beautiful.

43:31.010 --> 43:34.410
I mean, for a make-believe map of a make-believe world.

43:34.730 --> 43:36.090
There is the source of your troubles.

43:37.850 --> 43:39.130
Dark Island.

43:40.530 --> 43:42.850
A place where evil lurks.

43:45.010 --> 43:49.730
It can take any form. It can make your darkest dreams come true.

43:51.810 --> 43:53.770
It seeks to corrupt all goodness...

43:55.450 --> 43:57.690
to steal the light from this world.

43:58.090 --> 43:59.250
How do we stop it?

43:59.930 --> 44:02.570
You must break its spell.

44:02.930 --> 44:06.570
That sword you carry... there are six others.

44:06.930 --> 44:08.450
Have you seen them? Yes.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.970
The six lords, they passed through here?

44:11.410 --> 44:12.690
Indeed.

44:12.690 --> 44:13.930
Where were they headed?

44:13.930 --> 44:15.930
Where I sent them.

44:19.410 --> 44:20.930
To break the spell...

44:22.410 --> 44:24.490
you must follow the Blue Star...

44:25.770 --> 44:27.930
to Ramandu's Island.

44:28.250 --> 44:32.290
There, the seven swords must be laid at Aslan's table.

44:32.690 --> 44:35.250
Only then can their true magical power be released.

44:38.490 --> 44:39.810
But beware...

44:39.810 --> 44:42.890
you are all about to be tested.

44:43.210 --> 44:44.410
Tested?

44:46.490 --> 44:51.090
Until you lay down the seventh sword, evil has the upper hand.

44:52.690 --> 44:53.930
It will do everything...

44:54.210 --> 44:55.770
in its power...

44:56.010 --> 44:58.130
to tempt you.

45:03.490 --> 45:04.890
Be strong.

45:06.930 --> 45:09.850
Don't fall to temptation.

45:10.610 --> 45:13.490
To defeat the darkness out there...

45:13.850 --> 45:15.930
you must defeat the darkness inside yourself.

45:46.250 --> 45:48.410
For reasons beyond my comprehension...

45:48.730 --> 45:50.930
we have taken the advice of a senile old coot...

45:51.250 --> 45:55.210
who doesn't possess a razor and dawdles around in a dressing gown.

45:55.490 --> 46:00.290
So we're back in this tub and lost in a tempest. Brilliant.

46:00.730 --> 46:02.490
Hold.

46:03.730 --> 46:05.570
Three spokes to starboard.

46:05.850 --> 46:07.010
Aye-aye, sir.

46:07.250 --> 46:08.290
More pails here.

46:08.290 --> 46:10.010
Pass it down.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.810
Heave.

46:12.690 --> 46:16.890
Fourteen days of being tossed like a pancake and not the slightest sign of land.

46:21.730 --> 46:24.450
The only consolation is, everyone is finally...

46:24.770 --> 46:25.810
as miserable as I am.

46:28.770 --> 46:31.530
Except for that show-off talking rat.

46:31.850 --> 46:36.010
He's one of those annoying glass-is-always-half-full types.

46:39.530 --> 46:42.250
So we're stuck here...

46:43.410 --> 46:48.010
at half-rations, with food and water for two more weeks, maximum.

46:49.090 --> 46:51.970
This is your last chance to turn back, Your Majesties.

46:53.090 --> 46:56.050
There's no guarantee we will spot the Blue Star anytime soon.

46:56.410 --> 46:57.530
Not in this storm.

46:58.450 --> 47:01.490
Needle in a haystack, trying to find this Ramandu place.

47:01.810 --> 47:04.130
We could sail right past it and off the edge of the world.

47:04.450 --> 47:06.210
Or get eaten by a sea serpent.

47:08.770 --> 47:11.210
I am just saying the men are getting nervous.

47:12.050 --> 47:14.490
These are strange seas we're sailing...

47:14.810 --> 47:17.330
the likes of which I have never seen before.

47:17.570 --> 47:20.810
Then perhaps, Captain, you would like to be the one to explain to Mr. Rhince...

47:21.130 --> 47:23.010
that we're abandoning the search for his family.

47:26.330 --> 47:28.010
I will get back to it.

47:31.050 --> 47:32.410
Just a word of warning.

47:34.410 --> 47:37.970
The sea can play nasty tricks on the crew's mind.

47:38.770 --> 47:40.290
Very nasty.

48:12.730 --> 48:14.410
Transform my reflection

48:14.730 --> 48:18.850
Cast into perfection Lashes, lips and complexion

48:19.210 --> 48:20.250
Make me she

48:20.250 --> 48:24.570
Whom I'd agree Holds more beauty over me

49:31.050 --> 49:32.530
Ladies and gentlemen...

49:32.770 --> 49:34.330
Miss Pevensie.

49:37.450 --> 49:39.850
She's quite a looker. Swell.

49:40.210 --> 49:40.970
Edmund.

49:41.210 --> 49:42.690
You look beautiful, sister.

49:42.930 --> 49:44.050
As always.

49:44.290 --> 49:45.970
Peter.

49:46.410 --> 49:48.410
Excuse me, miss, can I get a photo?

49:48.730 --> 49:50.370
Mother's going to love this.

49:50.610 --> 49:52.370
All her children in one picture.

49:52.610 --> 49:53.770
Smile.

49:53.770 --> 49:57.450
Hang on, where am I? I mean, where's Lucy?

49:57.850 --> 50:00.010
Lucy? Who's Lucy?

50:00.970 --> 50:02.730
Susan, what's wrong?

50:03.050 --> 50:05.410
Come on now, miss. Nice big smile.

50:05.730 --> 50:08.290
Edmund, I am not sure about all this. I think I want to go back.

50:08.530 --> 50:09.410
Go back where?

50:09.690 --> 50:10.930
To Narnia.

50:11.210 --> 50:13.130
What on earth is Narnia?

50:13.410 --> 50:15.370
What's going on? Stop this.

50:23.250 --> 50:24.370
Lucy.

50:25.890 --> 50:27.210
Aslan?

50:31.010 --> 50:33.330
What have you done, child?

50:34.490 --> 50:35.810
I don't know.

50:36.810 --> 50:38.290
That was awful.

50:38.930 --> 50:40.970
But you chose it, Lucy.

50:42.370 --> 50:44.970
I didn't mean to choose all of that.

50:45.290 --> 50:48.330
I just wanted to be beautiful like Susan.

50:49.290 --> 50:51.130
That's all.

50:51.770 --> 50:55.730
You wished yourself away, and with it much more.

50:56.010 --> 50:59.730
Your brothers and sister wouldn't know Narnia without you, Lucy.

51:00.090 --> 51:03.330
You discovered it first, remember?

51:05.250 --> 51:07.090
I am so sorry.

51:07.970 --> 51:10.610
You doubt your value.

51:10.930 --> 51:13.690
Don't run from who you are.

51:15.850 --> 51:17.210
Aslan.

52:08.010 --> 52:10.970
Father. Father...

52:13.010 --> 52:15.330
Edmund. Edmund.

52:18.010 --> 52:21.530
Come with me. Join me.

52:24.890 --> 52:26.050
Edmund.

52:30.330 --> 52:32.210
Oh, Lucy.

52:34.730 --> 52:36.090
I can't sleep.

52:37.010 --> 52:38.250
Let me guess.

52:38.770 --> 52:40.130
Bad dreams.

52:41.610 --> 52:43.970
So either we're all going mad...

52:45.410 --> 52:48.410
or something is playing with our minds.

53:09.410 --> 53:11.450
I doubt the lords stopped here, my liege.

53:11.770 --> 53:13.610
There's no sign of anything living.

53:13.890 --> 53:14.690
Right.

53:14.690 --> 53:17.970
Well, once we get ashore, take your men and search for food and water.

53:18.330 --> 53:19.930
The three of us will look for clues.

53:20.210 --> 53:21.610
Hang on, you mean the four of us.

53:24.330 --> 53:26.570
Come on, please don't send me back to the rat.

53:26.890 --> 53:28.410
I heard that.

53:30.370 --> 53:31.250
Big ears.

53:31.490 --> 53:33.050
I heard that too.

53:39.210 --> 53:40.850
Go on, unload it all.

53:51.090 --> 53:53.330
Look, we're not the first ones on this island.

53:53.610 --> 53:54.490
The lords?

53:55.090 --> 53:56.970
Could be.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.210
What do you think could be down there?

54:04.730 --> 54:06.410
Let's find out.

54:42.690 --> 54:44.210
What's that?

54:44.210 --> 54:45.530
I don't know.

54:45.810 --> 54:48.050
Looks like some sort of gold statue.

55:07.410 --> 55:08.450
Ah.

55:19.410 --> 55:21.410
He must have fallen in.

55:22.530 --> 55:23.570
Poor man.

55:24.130 --> 55:25.450
You mean, "poor lord."

55:25.770 --> 55:26.930
The crest of Lord Restimar.

55:27.290 --> 55:28.330
And his sword.

55:28.330 --> 55:29.450
We need it.

55:32.890 --> 55:34.130
Be careful.

55:38.850 --> 55:40.730
Your sword hasn't turned to gold.

55:40.970 --> 55:42.290
Both the swords are magical.

55:43.930 --> 55:45.290
Here.

55:48.250 --> 55:49.810
He mustn't have known what hit him.

55:50.930 --> 55:51.890
Maybe.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.410
Or maybe he was onto something.

55:56.770 --> 55:58.010
What are you talking about?

56:17.970 --> 56:19.370
What are you staring at?

56:21.450 --> 56:24.370
Whoever has access to this pool...

56:25.250 --> 56:27.570
could be the most powerful person in the world.

56:31.570 --> 56:34.930
Lucy, we'd be so rich.

56:35.290 --> 56:37.050
No one could tell us what to do...

56:37.370 --> 56:38.930
or who to live with.

56:39.210 --> 56:41.410
You can't take anything out of Narnia, Edmund.

56:41.810 --> 56:43.290
Says who?

56:44.250 --> 56:45.370
I do.

56:52.930 --> 56:54.690
I am not your subject.

56:55.410 --> 56:57.010
You have been waiting for this, haven't you?

56:57.330 --> 56:59.210
To challenge me? You doubt my leadership?

56:59.210 --> 57:00.850
You doubt yourself.

57:00.850 --> 57:01.690
You're a child.

57:01.930 --> 57:03.090
And you're a spineless sap.

57:03.410 --> 57:04.090
Edmund.

57:04.330 --> 57:06.010
I am tired of playing second fiddle.

57:06.290 --> 57:08.530
First it was Peter and now it's you.

57:08.970 --> 57:11.010
You know I am braver than both of you.

57:11.330 --> 57:13.210
Why do you get Peter's sword?

57:13.730 --> 57:16.930
I deserve a kingdom of my own. I deserve to rule.

57:17.290 --> 57:19.450
If you think you're so brave, prove it.

57:20.010 --> 57:21.250
Ah.

57:22.410 --> 57:23.330
No.

57:23.970 --> 57:25.610
Stop it.

57:25.930 --> 57:26.930
Both of you.

57:28.850 --> 57:30.530
Look at yourselves.

57:30.850 --> 57:32.410
Can't you see what's happening?

57:33.770 --> 57:35.050
This place has tempted you.

57:36.010 --> 57:37.850
It's bewitching you.

57:38.690 --> 57:40.450
This is exactly what Coriakin was talking about.

57:42.130 --> 57:44.210
Let's just get out of here.

58:07.530 --> 58:12.330
Oh, yes, follow the imaginary Blue Star to the island of Ramandoodoo.

58:13.690 --> 58:17.210
Lay the seven steak knives at the table of a talking lion.

58:18.450 --> 58:19.850
Ninnies.

58:30.770 --> 58:31.450
What is that?

58:46.210 --> 58:48.050
I must be dead.

59:10.930 --> 59:11.890
Ah.

59:14.890 --> 59:16.770
You're definitely dead.

59:23.010 --> 59:25.330
Won't be needing that then, will you?

59:40.930 --> 59:42.130
Finally...

59:42.690 --> 59:44.810
a favorable turn of events.

59:54.090 --> 59:55.050
What food did you find?

59:57.930 --> 59:59.490
It's volcanic, Your Majesty.

59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.290
Not much grows.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:03.810
Where's Eustace?

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.570
I believe he's out, not helping us load the boats.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:09.970
Eustace.

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:12.410
Eustace.

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:17.370
Edmund, I have got a bad feeling.

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:19.490
I will go find him.

01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:21.290
I will come with you.

01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:33.490
Eustace.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.730
Eustace.

01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.410
Treasure.

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:46.450
Trouble.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:57.370
Eustace.

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:02.930
No.

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:10.410
Oh, cousin.

01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:13.610
I am sorry.

01:01:13.930 --> 01:01:15.330
He was just a boy.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:19.770
I never should have left him.

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.570
What could have happened to him?

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:31.210
In this place? Anything. And he wasn't the first.

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.970
It's Lord Octesian.

01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:40.930
We should find his...

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:45.010
...sword.

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:04.810
What was that?

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:10.810
Is it the volcano?

01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:15.690
Oh, no. That's no volcano.

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:17.450
All hands on deck there.

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:24.930
Archers, arm yourselves.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.410
Here, here.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.130
Take one and pass them on.

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:45.010
Take your positions...

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:46.530
and wait for my command.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.930
What's it doing?

01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:57.530
Fire.

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.850
Fire.

01:03:02.290 --> 01:03:03.970
He will break the mast.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:10.410
Right.

01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:13.850
Hold your positions.

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.010
Fire.
- Fire.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.010
Take that.

01:03:46.730 --> 01:03:47.410
Edmund.

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:48.850
Ed.

01:03:53.370 --> 01:03:54.410
Edmund.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:55.730
Lucy. Lucy.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:25.130
You have got to be joking.

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:37.850
He must have been tempted by the treasure.

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:40.970
Anyone knows a dragon's treasure is enchanted.

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:44.490
Well, anyone from here.

01:05:00.410 --> 01:05:03.010
Is there any way to change him back? Not that I know of.

01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:08.770
Aunt Alberta will not be pleased.

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.610
Sorry about the hand, old boy. I can be a little overzealous at times.

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.250
The boats are ready, Sire.

01:05:17.250 --> 01:05:18.570
We can't leave him alone.

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:21.330
We can't bring him on board, Your Majesty.

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:23.410
Drinian, you and the others take one boat back.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.330
The rest of us will stay here till morning...

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:27.010
and work out what to do.

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:29.450
But you have no provisions, and no means...

01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:31.090
of staying warm, Your Majesty.

01:05:35.410 --> 01:05:36.410
You were saying?

01:05:45.330 --> 01:05:47.930
I have never seen these constellations before.

01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:50.850
Me neither.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.410
We're a long way from home.

01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:58.570
When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing to the end of the world...

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.010
finding my father there.

01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:06.970
Maybe you will.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:22.530
I miss my mummy.

01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:29.530
I miss mine too.

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:31.810
Don't worry, you will see her again.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:33.130
How do you know?

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:36.450
You just have to have faith about these things.

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:38.290
Aslan will help us.

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:48.330
But Aslan couldn't stop her from being taken.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:51.370
We will find her. I promise.

01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:55.050
Somehow.

01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:13.210
Hmm.

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:22.690
Trouble sleeping?

01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:26.130
Now, now.

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:28.730
All is not as lost as it seems.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.090
I will stay up with you if you wish...

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.290
keep you company.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:38.290
I will wager you didn't even believe in dragons this morning.

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:41.410
Yes.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:43.850
You know...

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:48.850
extraordinary things only happen to extraordinary people.

01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:52.330
Maybe it's a sign...

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:55.410
that you have got an extraordinary destiny.

01:07:56.410 --> 01:08:00.330
Something greater than you could have imagined.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:06.210
I could tell you one or two of my adventures if you like...

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:09.050
just to pass the time.

01:08:09.370 --> 01:08:12.730
Believe it or not, you're not the first dragon I have encountered.

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:15.450
Many years ago, too many than I care to mention...

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:17.290
I was with a band of pirates.

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:20.649
I met another dragon, much fiercer than you...

01:08:31.290 --> 01:08:32.170
Lucy.

01:08:32.170 --> 01:08:34.609
Lucy, wake up.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:36.130
Look.

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:40.649
The Blue Star.

01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:41.810
Everybody.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.090
What? What is it?

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:45.130
Everybody, wake up.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:46.609
It's the Blue Star.

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.450
Come on, old boy, wake up.

01:09:26.010 --> 01:09:27.130
Pull.

01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:30.010
Mind your strokes there, lads.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.370
Pull.

01:09:33.569 --> 01:09:35.330
The wind has left us.

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:38.290
So how do we get to Ramandu's Island now then?

01:09:39.529 --> 01:09:42.569
My guess is something doesn't want us to get there.

01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:45.210
Pull.

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:47.609
All together.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:51.370
If I get any hungrier, I am going to eat that dragon.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:56.490
Don't worry, Eustace, they will have to deal with me first.

01:09:57.290 --> 01:09:58.010
Ah. Careful.

01:09:58.010 --> 01:10:01.330
If we don't find land by tonight, they may well eat that dragon.

01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.450
What did we hit?

01:10:12.570 --> 01:10:14.330
Eustace, that's brilliant.

01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:23.890
Onward, ho.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:49.730
We can't be sure the other lords even made it to Ramandu's Island.

01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:01.930
You got us there.

01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:04.970
What did I tell you, Eustace? Extraordinary. Ha-ha-ha.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.930
Extraordinary.

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:01.570
Mmm. Food.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:02.890
Wait.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.010
Huh?

01:12:39.570 --> 01:12:40.610
Lord Revilian.

01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:47.010
Lord Mavramorn.

01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:53.930
Lord Argoz.

01:13:01.930 --> 01:13:03.450
He's breathing.

01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.010
So are they.

01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.250
They're under a spell.

01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:18.210
It's the food.

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:19.570
Huh?

01:13:21.210 --> 01:13:22.090
Hey.

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:24.450
It's the stone knife.

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:25.690
This is Aslan's table.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:27.650
Their swords.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.370
On the table.

01:13:48.250 --> 01:13:49.370
That's six.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:53.290
Still missing one.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:58.930
Look.

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.090
Travelers of Narnia...

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:29.330
welcome.

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:33.290
Arise.

01:14:35.690 --> 01:14:37.050
Are you not hungry?

01:14:37.730 --> 01:14:38.690
Who are you?

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:42.930
I am Liliandil, daughter of Ramandu.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:44.810
I am your guide.

01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:49.890
You're a star?

01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:59.090
You are most beautiful.

01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:02.930
If it is a distraction for you, I can change form.

01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:04.450
No. No.

01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:07.170
Please.

01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:10.770
The food is for you.

01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:16.450
There is enough for all who are welcome at Aslan's table.

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:17.570
Always.

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:19.930
Help yourselves.

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:21.850
Wait.

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:23.570
What happened to them?

01:15:25.090 --> 01:15:26.530
These poor men were half-mad...

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:28.450
by the time they reached our shores.

01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:30.850
They were threatening violence upon each other.

01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:34.130
Violence is forbidden at the table of Aslan.

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:36.130
So they were sent to sleep.

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.330
Will they ever wake?

01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:41.010
When all is put right.

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:42.690
Come...

01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:44.290
there is little time.

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:04.610
The magician, Coriakin, told you of Dark Island?

01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:06.610
Yes.

01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:14.810
Before long, the evil will be unstoppable.

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:19.129
Coriakin said to break its spell, we lay the seven swords at Aslan's table.

01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:21.530
He speaks the truth.

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:23.290
But we only found six.

01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:25.650
Do you know where the seventh is?

01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:27.930
In there.

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:31.170
You will need great courage.

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:38.730
Now, waste no time.

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:43.570
I hope we meet again.

01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:47.490
Goodbye.

01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:16.450
So, what do you think is in there?

01:17:17.130 --> 01:17:19.250
Our worst nightmares.

01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:21.530
Our darkest wishes.

01:17:22.370 --> 01:17:24.450
Pure evil.

01:17:27.490 --> 01:17:29.930
Tavros, unlock the armory.

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:31.170
My lord.

01:17:31.450 --> 01:17:33.930
Archers, prepare yourselves.

01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:35.170
Aye, Captain.

01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:36.930
Light the lanterns.

01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:39.370
Let's get ready.

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:48.770
When I grow up, I want to be just like you.

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:57.930
When you grow up...

01:17:59.970 --> 01:18:03.890
you should be just like you.

01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:15.370
In case we don't get through whatever this is...

01:18:17.250 --> 01:18:19.730
I want you to know I think of you as my brother, Ed.

01:18:20.490 --> 01:18:21.450
Me too.

01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:28.930
You gave up your sword.

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.850
It wasn't mine to keep.

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:36.970
Use this.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:38.930
But it's...

01:18:39.170 --> 01:18:40.690
Peter would want you to have it.

01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:52.530
There it is, my friend.

01:18:53.450 --> 01:18:55.370
Our battle awaits.

01:18:56.050 --> 01:18:57.170
Eustace, no.

01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:58.770
Halt.

01:18:58.770 --> 01:19:00.690
Eustace, stop. Stop.

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:05.370
I will not accept surrender.

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:08.450
A noble warrior does not run from fear.

01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:11.770
Look at me. Look at me when I am talking to you.

01:19:13.930 --> 01:19:15.530
I am a mouse.

01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:17.890
You, you're a dragon.

01:19:18.570 --> 01:19:22.130
You have got skin like chain mail, you breathe fire.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:25.210
Come on, let's meet our destiny.

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:34.770
No matter what happens here...

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:37.730
every soul who stands before me has earned their place...

01:19:38.050 --> 01:19:39.890
on the crew of the Dawn Treader.

01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:43.090
Together we have traveled far.

01:19:43.450 --> 01:19:44.930
Together we have faced adversity.

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:47.010
Together we can do it again.

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.930
So now is not the time to fall to fear's temptations.

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:54.490
Be strong. Never give in.

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:57.810
Our world...

01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:59.930
our Narnian lives, depend on it.

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.970
Think of the lost souls we're here to save.

01:20:07.810 --> 01:20:09.690
Think of Aslan.

01:20:11.010 --> 01:20:12.690
Think of Narnia.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:15.530
- For Narnia.
- For Narnia.

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:17.970
For Narnia.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:15.730
Helaine.

01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:29.130
I can't see a thing.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:31.810
This fog's too thick.

01:21:37.610 --> 01:21:40.570
You are a great disappointment to me.

01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:45.690
You call yourself my son, then act like a king.

01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:52.610
Edmund, come with me.

01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:56.130
Be my king.

01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:59.730
I will let you rule.

01:21:59.730 --> 01:22:01.130
Go away.

01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:03.330
You're dead.

01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:06.170
You can never kill me.

01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:10.610
I will always be alive in your mind, silly boy.

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:12.130
No.

01:22:12.450 --> 01:22:13.130
Edmund?

01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:16.770
Are you all right?

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:19.090
Yeah.

01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:31.170
Keep away.

01:22:32.290 --> 01:22:34.690
Keep away.

01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:36.330
Who's there?

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:38.450
We do not fear you.

01:22:38.690 --> 01:22:40.730
Nor I you.

01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:51.490
Keep away.

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:52.730
We will not leave.

01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:55.850
You will not defeat me.

01:22:56.170 --> 01:22:56.970
Caspian.

01:22:57.290 --> 01:22:58.610
Caspian, his sword.

01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:02.570
Lord Rhoop.

01:23:04.690 --> 01:23:07.010
You do not own me.

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:09.050
Stand down.

01:23:09.050 --> 01:23:10.650
Let's get him on board, quickly.

01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:12.450
- Help him up.
- Ready, sir.

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:22.130
Be calm, my lord.

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.210
Off me, demon.

01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:25.650
No, my lord.

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:27.290
We are not here to hurt you.

01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:30.370
I am your king, Caspian.

01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:33.370
Caspian?

01:23:36.810 --> 01:23:38.170
My lord?

01:23:39.570 --> 01:23:42.690
You should not have come. There's no way out of here.

01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:43.930
Quickly...

01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:46.490
turn this ship about, before it's too late.

01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:48.130
We have the sword. Let's go.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:49.690
Let's turn her about, Drinian.

01:23:49.930 --> 01:23:51.330
Aye-aye, Your Majesty.

01:23:51.570 --> 01:23:52.530
Do not think.

01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:55.530
Do not let it know your fears...

01:23:55.850 --> 01:23:57.650
or it will become them.

01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:01.170
Oh, no.

01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:04.210
Edmund, what did you just think of?

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:05.970
Oh, I am sorry.

01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:22.170
Look.

01:24:22.450 --> 01:24:23.810
What is that?

01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:26.810
It's too late. It's too late.

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:32.570
It's gone under the boat.

01:24:32.850 --> 01:24:33.570
Gael.

01:24:43.210 --> 01:24:44.170
Come here.

01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:45.290
Run.

01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:49.810
Don't let me down. No fear. No retreat.

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:51.970
Hold fast.

01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:01.570
For Narnia.

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.130
Take that and that.

01:25:04.850 --> 01:25:06.330
Yah.

01:25:06.610 --> 01:25:08.490
Eustace, hang on.

01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:38.530
Out, creature.

01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:40.610
No. The sword. The sword.

01:25:40.930 --> 01:25:41.930
Eustace.

01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:44.850
No. Come back.

01:25:44.850 --> 01:25:46.890
We're all doomed. Doomed.

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:49.050
Turn this ship about.
- Stop him.

01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:51.370
Someone stop him.

01:25:58.290 --> 01:25:59.450
Now, crew...

01:25:59.690 --> 01:26:01.370
to your rowing positions.

01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:03.970
Oars at double speed.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:06.570
Aslan, please help us.

01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:15.290
Pull.

01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:17.290
Pull.

01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:38.250
Pull. Put your back into it.

01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:39.770
Pull.

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:44.890
Gael, come on. This way.

01:27:00.770 --> 01:27:03.890
Now you must stay here until someone comes and gets you. Okay?

01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:10.810
Ed. Ed.

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:14.010
We will ram the serpent. Smash him on the rocks.

01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:17.050
Steer her to port. I will keep it on the prow.

01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:20.530
Look out.

01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:26.650
Forward. Come on. Pull.

01:27:33.930 --> 01:27:35.850
Try and kill me. Come on.

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.010
Come on, I am here.

01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:42.370
No. Edmund.

01:27:55.810 --> 01:27:57.050
Archers...

01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:58.730
ready yourselves.

01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:02.530
I am still here.

01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:11.050
Brace yourselves.

01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:26.970
Move.

01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:43.530
We can beat this.

01:30:01.650 --> 01:30:03.090
We have to get it closer.

01:30:03.370 --> 01:30:04.610
All hands to the main deck.

01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:06.690
Ready the harpoons.

01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:14.170
I want everybody up here.

01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:19.370
Ready?

01:30:19.650 --> 01:30:20.850
Aye, sir.

01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:21.890
Now.

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:29.370
Pull its head down.

01:30:51.650 --> 01:30:52.610
Heave.

01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:03.010
Edmund.

01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:10.530
What are you trying to prove, Edmund?

01:31:11.810 --> 01:31:13.090
That you're a man?

01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:20.770
Edmund.

01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:24.930
Do it.

01:31:25.570 --> 01:31:26.850
I can make you that.

01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:28.730
I can make you my king.

01:31:31.610 --> 01:31:33.370
Just take my hand.

01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:48.570
Just give in.

01:31:57.930 --> 01:31:58.850
Do it.

01:32:00.610 --> 01:32:02.130
Come on.

01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:06.080
No.

01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:42.210
The spell...

01:32:42.490 --> 01:32:43.610
it's lifting.

01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:48.290
Edmund.

01:32:50.490 --> 01:32:52.090
Caspian.

01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:54.130
Look.

01:33:22.290 --> 01:33:24.530
Narnians. Narnians.

01:33:40.530 --> 01:33:41.730
Mummy.

01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:42.930
Helaine.

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:53.330
Rhince.

01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:54.370
Gael.

01:33:54.650 --> 01:33:56.530
Mummy.

01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:57.890
Mummy.

01:33:59.810 --> 01:34:01.530
Oh, Mummy.

01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:10.530
Let's have them on board. Clear the decks.

01:34:13.090 --> 01:34:14.770
We did it.

01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:16.770
I knew we would.

01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:18.850
It wasn't just us, though.

01:34:19.890 --> 01:34:20.930
You mean...

01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:23.810
Hey. Hey, I am down here, Lucy.

01:34:24.090 --> 01:34:25.210
Over here.

01:34:25.490 --> 01:34:27.610
Hey, Lucy. I am in the water. Lucy.

01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:28.730
Eustace.

01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:30.530
I am a boy again.

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:32.290
I am a boy.

01:34:32.610 --> 01:34:34.650
Eustace. I see your wings...

01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:36.090
have been clipped. Ha, ha.

01:34:39.290 --> 01:34:41.010
Where sky and water meet

01:34:41.290 --> 01:34:43.690
Where the waves grow ever sweet

01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:45.130
It is sweet.

01:34:45.930 --> 01:34:46.810
It's sweet.

01:34:49.530 --> 01:34:52.130
Look. Look.

01:34:58.690 --> 01:35:00.810
Aslan's country.

01:35:01.090 --> 01:35:03.130
We must be close.

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:05.530
Well, we have come this far.

01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:22.090
So, what was it like when Aslan changed you back?

01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:26.610
No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't do it myself.

01:35:27.090 --> 01:35:28.290
Then he came towards me.

01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:32.570
It sort of hurt, but it was a good pain.

01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:36.530
You know, like when you pull a thorn from your foot.

01:35:37.330 --> 01:35:39.210
Being a dragon wasn't all bad.

01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:43.530
I mean, I think I was a better dragon than I was a boy, really.

01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:45.690
I am so sorry for being such a sop.

01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:48.290
It's okay, Eustace.

01:35:48.610 --> 01:35:51.210
You were a pretty good dragon.

01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:58.450
My friends, we have arrived.

01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:36.690
Aslan.

01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.450
Welcome, children. You have done well.

01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:42.610
Very well indeed.

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.970
You have come far, and now your journey is at its end.

01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:49.170
Is this your country?

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.690
No, my country lies beyond.

01:36:55.530 --> 01:36:56.850
Is my father in your country?

01:36:57.370 --> 01:37:00.090
You can only find that out for yourself, my son.

01:37:01.090 --> 01:37:03.650
But you should know that if you continue...

01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:06.090
there is no return.

01:37:38.130 --> 01:37:40.890
You're not going?
- I can't imagine my father...

01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:44.370
would be very proud that I gave up what he died for.

01:37:46.730 --> 01:37:48.690
I spent too long wanting what was taken from me...

01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:50.770
and not what was given.

01:37:51.850 --> 01:37:54.010
I was given a kingdom.

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:56.570
A people.

01:38:02.650 --> 01:38:04.530
I promise to be a better king.

01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:07.170
You already are.

01:38:08.170 --> 01:38:09.530
Children.

01:38:10.690 --> 01:38:13.170
I think perhaps it's time we went home actually, Lu.

01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:17.730
But I thought you loved it here.

01:38:18.130 --> 01:38:19.330
I do.

01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:22.290
But I love home and our family as well.

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.530
They need us.

01:38:35.290 --> 01:38:37.170
Your Eminence...

01:38:37.530 --> 01:38:40.930
ever since I can remember, I have dreamt of seeing your country.

01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:44.530
I have had many great adventures in this world...

01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:47.170
but nothing has dampened that yearning.

01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:49.650
I know I am hardly worthy...

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:53.850
but with your permission, I would lay down my sword...

01:38:54.170 --> 01:38:58.290
for the joy of seeing your country with my own eyes.

01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:06.130
My country was made for noble hearts such as yours...

01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:08.930
no matter how small their bearers be.

01:39:09.730 --> 01:39:10.850
Your Majesty.

01:39:10.850 --> 01:39:12.610
No one could be more deserving.

01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:14.210
- Well, I--
- It's true.

01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:29.770
May I?

01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:33.170
Well, I suppose. Just this--

01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:41.090
Goodbye, Lucy.

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:58.090
Don't cry.

01:39:58.370 --> 01:40:00.610
I don't understand.

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:06.090
Will I not see you again? Ever?

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:10.810
What a magnificent puzzle you are, and a true hero.

01:40:11.170 --> 01:40:14.650
It has been my honor to fight beside such a brave warrior...

01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:16.610
and a great friend.

01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:30.970
I won't be needing this.

01:40:58.890 --> 01:41:00.530
This is our last time here, isn't it?

01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:01.690
Yes.

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:05.610
You have grown up, my dear one.

01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:07.970
Just like Peter and Susan.

01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:10.850
Will you visit us in our world?

01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:14.290
I shall be watching you, always.

01:41:16.490 --> 01:41:17.810
How?

01:41:18.290 --> 01:41:21.250
In your world, I have another name.

01:41:21.650 --> 01:41:23.850
You must learn to know me by it.

01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:27.250
That was the very reason you were brought to Narnia.

01:41:27.570 --> 01:41:30.250
That by knowing me here for a little...

01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:33.370
you may know me better there.

01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:35.250
Will we meet again?

01:41:35.850 --> 01:41:39.850
Mm. Yes, dear one. One day.

01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:57.810
You're the closest thing I have to family.

01:41:59.690 --> 01:42:01.930
And that includes you, Eustace.

01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:05.050
Thank you.

01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:34.850
Will I come back?

01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:37.970
Narnia may yet have need of you.

01:43:35.130 --> 01:43:36.890
Eustace?

01:43:37.650 --> 01:43:38.330
Eustace...

01:43:39.970 --> 01:43:41.570
what are you doing up there?

01:43:42.290 --> 01:43:43.450
Jill Pole's...

01:43:43.730 --> 01:43:45.210
dropped in for a visit.

01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:59.210
We spoke often of Narnia in the days that followed.

01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:05.290
And when my cousins left, after the war ended...

01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:09.810
I missed them with all my heart...

01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:14.170
as I know all Narnians will miss them...

01:44:15.450 --> 01:44:17.890
till the end of time.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.590
# There's a place out there for us #

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:31.873
# More than just a prayer #

01:45:31.873 --> 01:45:35.600
# Or anything you have ever dreamed of #

01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.271
# So when you feel like giving up #

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:44.419
# because you don't fit in down here #

01:45:45.025 --> 01:45:46.695
# Fear is crashing in #

01:45:47.349 --> 01:45:50.810
# Close your eyes and take my hand, yeah #

01:45:51.347 --> 01:45:57.713
# We can be the kings and queens Of anything if we believe #

01:45:58.301 --> 01:46:02.448
# It's written in the stars that shine above #

01:46:05.448 --> 01:46:08.629
# A world where you and I belong #

01:46:09.141 --> 01:46:12.246
# Where faith and love will keep us strong #

01:46:13.199 --> 01:46:17.472
# Exactly who we are is just enough #

01:46:18.583 --> 01:46:22.453
# There's a place for us #

01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:29.598
# There's a place for us #

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.802
# When the water meets the sky #

01:46:41.293 --> 01:46:44.584
# Where your heart is free #

01:46:45.459 --> 01:46:47.940
# And hope comes back to life #

01:46:48.485 --> 01:46:51.542
# When these broken hands #

01:46:52.556 --> 01:46:55.553
# Are whole again #

01:46:56.285 --> 01:46:59.642
# Well, we will find What we have been waiting for #

01:47:00.231 --> 01:47:03.397
# We were made for so much more #

01:47:04.041 --> 01:47:10.608
# We can be the kings and queens Of anything if we believe #

01:47:11.138 --> 01:47:15.894
# It's written in the stars that shine above #

01:47:18.225 --> 01:47:21.462
# A world where you and I belong #

01:47:22.014 --> 01:47:25.083
# Where faith and love will keep us strong #

01:47:25.675 --> 01:47:30.142
# Exactly who we are is just enough #

01:47:31.306 --> 01:47:34.725
# There's a place for us #

01:47:38.593 --> 01:47:43.226
# There's a place for us #

01:47:47.159 --> 01:47:49.746
# So hold on #

01:47:51.402 --> 01:47:53.664
# Hold on #

01:47:56.783 --> 01:48:00.983
# There's a place for us #

01:48:04.085 --> 01:48:10.605
# We can be the kings and queens Of anything if we believe #

01:48:11.154 --> 01:48:15.742
# It's written in the stars that shine above #

01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:21.511
# A world where you and I belong #

01:48:25.631 --> 01:48:30.230
# Exactly who we are is just enough #

01:48:31.965 --> 01:48:37.656
# Yeah, exactly who we are is just enough #

01:48:38.591 --> 01:48:42.522
# There's a place for us #
