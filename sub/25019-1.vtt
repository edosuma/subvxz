01:05.755 --> 01:06.755
Mom.

01:07.895 --> 01:08.895
Mom.

01:09.448 --> 01:10.448
Hmm?

01:35.923 --> 01:37.304
Electric's busted again.

01:39.237 --> 01:40.479
Go back to sleep.

...the family and children--

04:12.562 --> 04:14.530
And a pack of Kentucky Best.

04:14.564 --> 04:15.564
Sorry.

04:16.946 --> 04:18.947
Can you do later than that?
Like after 8:00?

04:18.982 --> 04:22.019
And a pack
of AAA batteries, too.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.815
Okay, my mom will be there then.

04:23.849 --> 04:25.057
How much is that going to be?

04:25.092 --> 04:26.714
And a pack of AAA batt...

04:26.749 --> 04:29.372
Can I get somebody who's
gonna do their job out here?

04:29.407 --> 04:30.580
Just to look?

04:30.960 --> 04:31.823
Sorry.

04:31.857 --> 04:33.273
Angie, who are you
on the phone with?

04:33.307 --> 04:34.446
Can I get that
to you next weekend.

04:34.481 --> 04:35.965
$60 is kinda tight
for me right now.

04:35.999 --> 04:37.863
You know what, forget about it.

04:37.898 --> 04:39.451
Keep your shit.

04:39.486 --> 04:40.728
Sorry, can I get that to you...

04:40.763 --> 04:42.282
Angie, get off the damn phone.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.698
In one more second, you are not
going to have a job no more.

04:44.732 --> 04:45.733
Okay, thank you so much.

04:45.768 --> 04:47.839
Call me at this number
if you need anything.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.497
I'm sorry. It was an emergency.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.981
It's always an emergency.

04:52.015 --> 04:53.223
Anyone else was your manager,

04:53.258 --> 04:55.709
they would have chucked your ass
so far out into that street.

04:57.435 --> 04:59.299
I'm trying here, Wyatt,
all right?

04:59.333 --> 05:00.955
No, you ain't.
You ain't trying.

05:00.990 --> 05:03.199
You've got to stretch
outside of yourself.

05:03.233 --> 05:04.752
Because this ain't
working for me.

05:09.274 --> 05:10.310
Wyatt?

05:18.421 --> 05:19.629
Hey there, Angie.

05:20.906 --> 05:21.976
Terry.

05:22.011 --> 05:28.120
Um, this and, I'm gonna need
some dip for Billy.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.364
Um, we're out of that.

05:32.228 --> 05:33.228
Okay.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.856
Um. Hey.

05:39.891 --> 05:42.134
You remember that pastor
from when we was kids?

05:42.169 --> 05:43.722
Pastor Stevens.

05:43.757 --> 05:46.829
His wife, she got the cancer.
Poor thing.

05:47.554 --> 05:49.418
- It's awful.
- I know.

05:49.452 --> 05:51.385
God works in mysterious ways.

05:51.420 --> 05:53.422
And for the ones
working for Him.

05:53.456 --> 05:56.597
But, they are doing
like a fundraising thingy and,

05:57.840 --> 05:59.048
you should come.

05:59.082 --> 06:01.740
It will be fun.
They're gonna have a band.

06:01.775 --> 06:03.604
Yeah, gotta be watching Trey.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.572
Babysitter.

06:12.648 --> 06:14.822
I'm sorry whatever is going on,
is going on.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.033
Got to do
what you got to do, right?

06:19.068 --> 06:23.417
Think I'd be working at that
craphole club if I didn't know that?

06:23.452 --> 06:24.867
No, thank you, ma'am.

06:25.488 --> 06:27.007
I see how people look at me.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.975
Like being a dancer
is same as being a whore.

06:31.632 --> 06:33.600
But I make three times
what the secretary do.

06:33.634 --> 06:34.739
And I ain't embarrassed

06:34.773 --> 06:37.362
'cause what they don't
realize is,

06:37.397 --> 06:39.916
they ain't using me,
I'm using them.

06:43.679 --> 06:44.852
$17.04.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.728
You gave me too much.

07:25.203 --> 07:26.584
Uh, just these.

07:29.103 --> 07:30.173
Miss?

07:36.214 --> 07:37.249
Sorry.

07:40.011 --> 07:43.255
You okay, darling? You look
like a cat on hot bricks.

07:44.222 --> 07:45.222
Yeah.

07:45.810 --> 07:46.845
Just these?

07:50.884 --> 07:53.507
What the fuck
you knocking like that for?

07:53.542 --> 07:54.819
Ain't you think nobody home?

07:54.853 --> 07:58.305
- Are you Ruth Anne?
- I don't know. Who are you?

07:58.339 --> 08:00.514
Now, ma'am,
your daughter called us.

08:00.549 --> 08:01.722
Your electric's busted.

08:01.757 --> 08:04.207
And I've been knocking
for 15 minutes on now.

08:07.452 --> 08:09.385
My daughter got the paranoia.

08:09.419 --> 08:12.077
She thinks she sees shit
she don't see.

08:13.251 --> 08:14.494
Is this real?

08:14.528 --> 08:15.840
'Cause it's every week.

08:17.635 --> 08:19.257
Already with this shit.

08:43.764 --> 08:46.042
- You fixed it?
- I'll be right back.

08:53.671 --> 08:54.948
What are you doing here?

08:57.916 --> 09:00.332
Ain't nothing to watch here
but a crazy old lady.

09:04.992 --> 09:06.960
Now go back home, kid.
You're creeping me out.

09:12.862 --> 09:15.106
Come on, baby.
That's all right.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.246
You go ahead
into Nana's room, okay?

09:17.936 --> 09:18.937
All right.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.154
White trash piece of shit.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.157
That cross around your neck,

09:32.641 --> 09:34.401
real Christian.

09:34.435 --> 09:37.266
Who are you? You can't
judge me in my own house.

09:37.300 --> 09:39.544
Who the fuck you think you are?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.615
Why you think
you got a job like this?

09:41.650 --> 09:43.341
Idiot work.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.481
Low life, stealing from people.

09:45.515 --> 09:48.001
Piece of dog-shit,
that's who you are.

09:49.278 --> 09:50.590
Where you going?

09:50.624 --> 09:51.798
Electric's busted.

09:51.832 --> 09:53.558
- You gonna fix it?
- No.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.284
Asshole, who gonna fix it?

09:55.318 --> 09:56.630
Nobody.

09:56.665 --> 09:58.080
You have to get a whole new one.

10:11.127 --> 10:12.128
What happened?

10:12.853 --> 10:14.199
Did the electrician come?

10:15.028 --> 10:16.028
Yeah.

10:18.169 --> 10:20.620
Okay, you are not
doing this in front of Trey.

10:20.654 --> 10:21.897
He's the inspector.

10:21.931 --> 10:23.657
We got a call
from your electrician.

10:23.692 --> 10:25.590
There's an emergency.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.212
How long before it's fixed?

10:27.247 --> 10:30.112
I'm afraid you've got to find
some place else to stay.

10:30.146 --> 10:31.561
This house is done.

10:31.596 --> 10:33.287
Sorry? What?

10:33.322 --> 10:34.668
What are you telling me?

10:35.635 --> 10:38.465
Yeah. Can you see
those wires?

10:38.499 --> 10:39.984
That's a fire waiting to happen.

10:41.261 --> 10:42.261
But that,

10:42.883 --> 10:45.679
huh, that's black mold.

10:45.714 --> 10:47.750
I don't want to tell you
what that can do to you.

10:47.785 --> 10:50.442
You need to find
some place else to stay.

10:50.477 --> 10:52.721
- Starting when?
- Now.

10:52.755 --> 10:56.138
Well, we ain't got
no place else to go.

10:56.172 --> 10:57.622
Listen, lady,

10:57.657 --> 11:01.281
unless you want that mold doing some
serious damage to your kid's brain,

11:01.315 --> 11:03.973
I suggest you figure it out
right quick.

11:19.437 --> 11:22.233
Okay. So, this is the playroom.

11:22.267 --> 11:23.267
Okay.

11:25.236 --> 11:26.409
This is the living room,

11:27.548 --> 11:28.895
the bathroom.

11:30.379 --> 11:31.379
Okay.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.071
Yeah, it'll do.

11:34.728 --> 11:37.455
- Seven hundred, you said.
- Yes. Hm-mm.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.871
Well, is there anyway, uh,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.150
could you do any better
than that?

11:44.324 --> 11:47.879
Your ad said you are looking
to rent immediately. So...

11:48.362 --> 11:49.362
Mm-hmm.

11:52.297 --> 11:53.851
$675.

11:53.885 --> 11:55.059
That's great.

11:56.785 --> 11:58.027
That's still,

11:59.235 --> 12:00.685
still kind of a lot.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.204
I work down at the Dairy Mart.

12:02.238 --> 12:05.034
Yeah, well, we are not
looking to lose money on this.

12:05.069 --> 12:06.656
You're getting the whole house.

12:06.691 --> 12:08.382
No, I know, it's just...

12:09.694 --> 12:12.559
I can't afford that, right now.

12:12.593 --> 12:14.250
Our house got the black mold.

12:14.285 --> 12:16.252
And I got a little boy.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.980
Can you do five?

12:21.879 --> 12:23.777
We can do $650.

12:26.366 --> 12:28.023
It's just...

12:28.989 --> 12:31.233
I haven't got that right now.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.999
$625.

12:43.245 --> 12:44.253
Okay.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.283
All right.

12:45.319 --> 12:46.524
Cool.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.801
You are lucky now.

12:47.836 --> 12:50.355
- We had a week...
- Yeah.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.874
...left to rent this place.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.635
All right. How do
you want to do this?

12:54.670 --> 12:57.397
Um, can I come back in a little?

12:57.431 --> 13:01.159
Okay, that would be $1875.

13:02.851 --> 13:05.301
I thought we just said $625.

13:05.336 --> 13:08.615
Yeah, that's
first, last, security.

13:08.649 --> 13:10.168
It's $1,875.

13:12.895 --> 13:14.215
There's no...

13:14.932 --> 13:16.278
There's no way.

13:16.312 --> 13:18.038
I mean, we are
not doing a credit check,

13:18.073 --> 13:19.626
we are not doing nothing.

13:19.660 --> 13:22.215
Can I get you the first month and
then pay you rest off over time?

13:22.249 --> 13:24.527
Mm-mm.
We ain't a Little Way here.

13:24.562 --> 13:26.012
I know. I am gonna have it.

13:26.046 --> 13:28.298
It's just not, not all
at once right now is all.

13:28.334 --> 13:29.049
Miss, miss.

13:29.084 --> 13:31.224
I can't have my son
living out of my car.

13:32.466 --> 13:33.467
I'm begging you.

13:33.502 --> 13:35.849
Listen, we're not
renting this for fun.

13:35.884 --> 13:37.851
Unfortunately, you're not
the only one

13:37.886 --> 13:39.197
in a troubled situation.

13:42.213 --> 13:43.283
I'm sorry.

13:46.170 --> 13:47.861
- $1700.
- Maya.

13:47.896 --> 13:50.174
That's what we need.

13:50.381 --> 13:53.971
Look, you bring us that $1700,
it's yours.

13:54.005 --> 13:55.973
Now, we can't hold it for you,

13:56.178 --> 13:59.181
but if you bring us that cash
before anyone else,

13:59.741 --> 14:00.741
you can have it.

14:05.741 --> 14:06.949
Yeah.

14:08.364 --> 14:09.364
Thank you.

14:10.677 --> 14:14.267
Y'all need any extra help
washing hair or something?

14:14.301 --> 14:15.475
Uh, no, sweetie.

14:15.509 --> 14:17.995
The girls that shampoo hair
are actually in training.

14:19.272 --> 14:21.895
What about, like,
sweeping the hair?

14:21.930 --> 14:23.276
Uh, it's the same girls.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.174
Hello.

14:25.209 --> 14:27.280
Hey, Karen. It's Angie.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.198
We're in a bit
of a trouble spot.

14:29.295 --> 14:31.988
Wondering if we could
come stay with you

14:32.131 --> 14:33.684
for a few days.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.343
Just while we are
figuring out where to go.

14:37.738 --> 14:39.741
Honey, aren't there,
like, services for that,

14:39.776 --> 14:41.467
like, down City Hall
or something?

14:42.730 --> 14:43.765
Yeah.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.196
You should see this girl down
at the supermarket, Aunt Karen.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.509
She's got a scar
clear down the side of her face

14:49.543 --> 14:51.373
from when she was at
one of those places.

14:51.407 --> 14:53.478
I mean, who knows
what could happen to Trey,

14:53.513 --> 14:56.102
him being so quiet,
the way he is, and all.

14:56.136 --> 14:57.862
Now, I would let you...

14:57.897 --> 15:00.727
...but you know that he's
not going to let Trey stay with us.

15:00.761 --> 15:02.453
Makes people uncomfortable

15:02.487 --> 15:06.284
because, well, like you said,
he's so quiet.

15:07.630 --> 15:09.909
I was hoping
'cause this is a real emergency.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.462
They don't do that.

15:11.496 --> 15:13.153
Maybe they might let me borrow against
my paycheck just this one time.

15:13.188 --> 15:15.052
- You know, they don't do that.
- Can you just ask?

15:15.086 --> 15:16.329
I don't make the rules.

15:16.363 --> 15:18.055
I ain't got no way
to overwrite them.

15:18.676 --> 15:19.988
This is a corporation.

15:23.474 --> 15:24.475
Thanks.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.099
But, um,

15:29.687 --> 15:31.309
here are

15:33.898 --> 15:38.420
coupons to the table
for some free meals.

15:38.454 --> 15:43.080
I was going to use them,
but, you, you take them.

15:45.013 --> 15:46.152
Thanks.

15:49.569 --> 15:51.709
Hey there, how many
in y'all's party?

15:51.743 --> 15:53.711
Oh, yeah, we a party, all right.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.368
Just us three.

16:01.029 --> 16:02.306
Sit right there, baby.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.446
Y'all enjoy now.

16:08.726 --> 16:09.969
Excuse me.

16:11.004 --> 16:12.040
Excuse me!

16:14.421 --> 16:15.491
Something wrong?

16:15.526 --> 16:17.045
Can I get a Busch Light?

16:17.079 --> 16:18.391
I'll be with you in one second.

16:18.425 --> 16:19.944
I'm just taking
this table's order.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.152
We have this table right now.

16:21.187 --> 16:22.602
Ain't you sure
you can't remember Busch Light?

16:22.636 --> 16:23.637
We can wait.

16:26.778 --> 16:31.162
Can you just please, please
give me the night off?

16:31.197 --> 16:34.476
You, arse. You are arse, girl.

16:37.237 --> 16:39.584
Tell them I want
the chicken francese.

16:50.112 --> 16:52.494
...I'm held up
with disability.

16:52.528 --> 16:56.153
All that back pay,
I could buy Hawaii.

16:57.982 --> 17:00.191
How's Bruce doing?

17:00.226 --> 17:03.746
Bruce's doing super.
He just built a new pool.

17:04.885 --> 17:06.163
Well, no offense,

17:06.196 --> 17:08.474
but I think that pool's
look tacky

17:08.510 --> 17:10.580
sitting up on the lawn
like that.

17:10.615 --> 17:12.893
No, no. They're building
in-ground pool.

17:12.928 --> 17:15.896
Oh. Excuse me.

17:15.931 --> 17:18.589
Somebody got some money now.

17:18.623 --> 17:21.040
That's right.
I'm not complaining.

17:23.180 --> 17:25.492
Is Bruce coming?

17:25.527 --> 17:27.770
That son of mine,
he just works all the time.

17:27.805 --> 17:29.289
Everything all right, ma'am?

17:31.912 --> 17:33.638
How's your sister Carol?

17:33.673 --> 17:35.226
Ah, hold up.

17:36.710 --> 17:38.471
We ain't even eaten yet.

17:38.505 --> 17:40.611
Actually, I got to go,
you know...

17:40.645 --> 17:43.027
- Okay, honey.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.270
Okay, honey.

17:45.892 --> 17:46.892
Okay, wait.

17:47.997 --> 17:49.378
Can I get that hot dog?

17:49.999 --> 17:51.139
Thank you.

17:58.284 --> 18:00.665
Why you always got to have
one of your episodes

18:00.700 --> 18:01.804
right when I'm trying--

18:01.839 --> 18:03.668
Talking to them
like they're your best friends.

18:03.703 --> 18:04.945
They didn't do nothing.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.810
You don't go try, and sentence
everyone all the time.

18:11.435 --> 18:12.435
Coming?

18:18.338 --> 18:19.822
I didn't mean nothing.

18:23.205 --> 18:25.759
I said I didn't mean nothing.
Come on.

18:28.762 --> 18:30.350
Enjoy the hotdog, sweetheart.

18:36.184 --> 18:37.978
There's something wrong
with them, by the way.

18:38.013 --> 18:39.532
- You know Tom.
- He's fine.

18:42.742 --> 18:44.847
So what do we got to do
about the place?

18:46.573 --> 18:48.541
I found us one.

18:48.575 --> 18:50.750
Thank goodness.
When are we moving in?

18:51.923 --> 18:53.856
When we got $1700.

18:55.686 --> 18:56.825
Jesus.

18:57.860 --> 18:59.345
We got maybe a week.

19:00.622 --> 19:02.071
Jesus.

19:02.106 --> 19:04.695
He already proved
there's a God or not.

19:04.729 --> 19:07.146
There's a proof
right then and there.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.907
You drive me crazy.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.392
What he did, he gets a pool.

19:14.118 --> 19:15.533
What do I get?

19:18.295 --> 19:19.675
Now you want to sue him?

19:19.986 --> 19:21.298
Yes.

19:21.332 --> 19:23.162
This happened
when you were five,

19:23.196 --> 19:25.164
so it's 19 years ago.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.613
That's correct, sir.

19:26.648 --> 19:29.754
You know, lawsuits like this
can go on for quite a long time,

19:29.789 --> 19:32.274
for years. It's not going
to take care of your problem

19:32.309 --> 19:34.414
in time that you need.

19:34.449 --> 19:37.762
Um, can you just
threaten him then?

19:37.797 --> 19:41.594
Tell him I'll sue him
if he doesn't pay.

19:41.628 --> 19:45.460
This isn't the road
you can go down, you know.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.498
He took something from me.

19:49.533 --> 19:50.810
Now I'm gonna take
something from him.

19:50.844 --> 19:54.676
Yeah, but it's just
not an option for ya.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.748
Kentucky law states

19:57.782 --> 20:02.546
that you... A suit
for child sexual abuse

20:02.580 --> 20:05.100
has to be filed
within five years

20:05.134 --> 20:06.412
of the last incident

20:06.446 --> 20:09.380
or, five years
of your turning 18.

20:09.415 --> 20:11.658
It was 19 years ago.
You are 24.

20:11.693 --> 20:15.628
It's one year past
the statute of limitations.

20:15.662 --> 20:18.182
When it happened to you,
you only had a year

20:18.217 --> 20:22.531
and a five-year-old's testimony
isn't considered credible.

20:23.394 --> 20:25.293
You would had have
other evidence.

20:30.298 --> 20:35.061
Hey, I understand,
I understand that...

20:35.095 --> 20:36.095
You understand?

20:37.926 --> 20:39.307
You understand what?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.895
You understand what he did to me

20:41.930 --> 20:43.207
when I was five-years-old?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.382
You understand that this is a
monster we are dealing with?

20:45.416 --> 20:47.591
That he just built himself
a fucking pool

20:47.625 --> 20:50.387
and I can't even buy
my son a sandwich.

20:50.421 --> 20:52.941
You understand that?

20:54.149 --> 20:55.495
Angie...

20:56.427 --> 20:59.672
Can I, can I have
a glass of water?

21:01.190 --> 21:03.262
Could you bring in
a glass of water, please.

21:06.437 --> 21:09.440
Well, you could file
a report on him.

21:09.475 --> 21:11.891
And that way,
it would be on record

21:11.925 --> 21:15.308
in case he did it again.
Would help someone else.

21:17.517 --> 21:21.832
So, so he just gets away
with what he did,

21:23.523 --> 21:25.180
and I can't do nothing.

21:25.214 --> 21:29.978
Well, not unless, God forbid,
he's done it to someone else.

21:30.012 --> 21:32.429
Maybe you can get him
to settle with the two of you.

21:35.466 --> 21:36.709
The water, sir.

21:41.230 --> 21:42.230
Angie.

21:45.234 --> 21:46.374
Hello.

21:48.583 --> 21:50.412
Hi, um,

21:50.447 --> 21:52.897
I'm looking for Emily.
When she was little

21:52.932 --> 21:56.038
- was she around...
- Who's there?

21:56.073 --> 21:58.351
Somebody who knew Emily,
but I don't know.

21:58.386 --> 21:59.870
- Let me--
- No, no, wait.

21:59.904 --> 22:01.181
You get too excited.

22:01.216 --> 22:02.666
Terry, let me handle it.

22:04.012 --> 22:05.634
Now, who are you?

22:05.669 --> 22:07.291
Uh, Emily and I
were couple of years apart,

22:07.326 --> 22:09.362
but we went
to the same Sunday school.

22:09.397 --> 22:11.502
- She doesn't...
- Why are you asking about that?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.644
I need to talk to her.

22:16.783 --> 22:17.888
She ain't here.

22:19.545 --> 22:21.270
Can you let me know
where she is?

22:21.305 --> 22:23.894
- 'Cause...
- What she want?

22:23.928 --> 22:24.929
What if she has--

22:24.964 --> 22:26.828
Terry, get on out of here.
Let me handle it.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.696
Come on. This way.

22:35.733 --> 22:38.011
Miss, there ain't good way
to tell you this.

22:39.427 --> 22:41.152
But Emily has gone
and left this world.

22:47.158 --> 22:48.401
Were you all friends?

22:50.334 --> 22:51.439
Uh, no.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.164
No.

22:55.270 --> 22:56.754
I didn't know her too good.

22:57.445 --> 22:58.963
No one knew her too good.

23:00.448 --> 23:02.381
Still kinda picking up
the pieces.

23:05.073 --> 23:08.352
What, what was it you wanted
to talk to her about?

23:08.387 --> 23:09.733
Maybe I could help you with it.

23:13.909 --> 23:14.909
I'm sorry.

23:17.948 --> 23:18.948
I got to...

23:19.674 --> 23:20.674
Sorry.

23:55.744 --> 23:56.745
Angie.

23:58.126 --> 23:59.230
Can I speak to you?

23:59.886 --> 24:00.887
Well, of course.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.479
Church looks real nice.

24:06.514 --> 24:08.343
Well, we just painted.

24:08.377 --> 24:10.897
So, we are looking
spring-clean right now.

24:10.932 --> 24:12.968
Yeah, it's nice.

24:13.003 --> 24:15.695
Wish we saw
a little more of you.

24:15.730 --> 24:19.043
Yeah, um, I got lot
on my plate these days.

24:19.078 --> 24:22.530
Well, that's very thing
God's here to help you with.

24:24.428 --> 24:28.743
You are a pastor so I can talk
to you about anything, right?

24:28.777 --> 24:29.882
Of course.

24:30.917 --> 24:34.334
You know about Emily Winslow?

24:34.369 --> 24:37.199
Held her mother right here
in my arms when it happened.

24:38.718 --> 24:42.791
I remember seeing Emily

24:44.310 --> 24:47.175
outside in the back lawn
of the church

24:48.556 --> 24:50.834
after Sunday school sometimes.

24:52.629 --> 24:54.907
You don't know anything
about that, do you?

24:55.701 --> 24:57.737
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

24:58.842 --> 25:02.742
When I was a kid,
I remember seeing some things.

25:02.777 --> 25:06.090
There were some things going on
in the back lawn of the church

25:07.057 --> 25:10.543
with one of the moniters
and some of the kids.

25:13.132 --> 25:15.583
You don't know anything?

25:16.307 --> 25:18.033
I certainly do not.

25:19.897 --> 25:21.589
Bruce Watkins.

25:21.623 --> 25:24.177
What about Bruce Watkins?

25:24.212 --> 25:27.180
I saw him do stuff to kids.

25:27.802 --> 25:29.528
Out in the back lawn.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.530
If the Church
had known anything,

25:31.564 --> 25:32.910
we would have done something.

25:32.945 --> 25:35.223
Now, are you aware
of any charges?

25:35.257 --> 25:36.914
- No.
- Neither am I.

25:36.949 --> 25:39.192
So, what are you after, Angie?

25:40.159 --> 25:43.369
What benefit could you
possibly get out of this?

25:43.403 --> 25:44.612
Benefit?

25:44.646 --> 25:46.372
He helped build those new pews

25:46.406 --> 25:48.961
and that fresh coat of paint
you were just admiring.

25:48.995 --> 25:51.308
And now I know
you are not here to pray,

25:51.342 --> 25:52.965
so what are you after?

25:52.999 --> 25:55.484
I need to see if there were
other girls, younger than me.

25:55.519 --> 25:56.658
What for?

25:56.693 --> 25:59.005
So, he can pay for what he did.

25:59.040 --> 26:01.352
I got to move out of my house.
I got nowhere to go--

26:01.387 --> 26:03.182
You are doing this for money.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.330
Angie.

26:08.152 --> 26:11.466
I really think you need
to consider praying on this

26:11.500 --> 26:13.848
before you take
one step further.

26:14.816 --> 26:16.818
I've prayed plenty
on this, Pastor.

26:18.617 --> 26:21.068
Maybe He could have
the decency to answer.

26:35.076 --> 26:36.077
Look at you.

26:38.562 --> 26:39.667
You are a mess.

26:42.462 --> 26:43.602
You didn't get your bath?

26:51.161 --> 26:52.162
Mom.

26:54.164 --> 26:56.062
- Mom.
- Yeah.

26:56.097 --> 26:58.168
You are supposed
to be watching Trey.

26:58.202 --> 27:00.584
I am. I am here, you know.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.586
He's covered in marker.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.450
I asked him if he wanted a bath,

27:04.484 --> 27:05.900
but he didn't say nothing...

27:07.556 --> 27:08.903
Okay, I am here
for another five minutes.

27:08.937 --> 27:10.525
I don't have time
to boil the water.

27:10.559 --> 27:11.837
I need you to get up now.

27:11.871 --> 27:14.184
When are we going to be
out of here by?

27:14.218 --> 27:15.495
Yesterday.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.877
Come on. Come with me, baby.

27:19.154 --> 27:20.362
Here we go.

27:20.397 --> 27:21.709
Okay, come on.

27:21.743 --> 27:23.434
Bath time, okay?

27:23.469 --> 27:25.678
- No. Hm-mm.
- Trey.

27:25.713 --> 27:27.438
You got to let me, okay?

27:27.473 --> 27:29.406
Please. Trey.

27:31.445 --> 27:34.103
Please make sure he gets a bath.
The water's on stove.

27:35.584 --> 27:38.380
I need you to get up now.

27:40.485 --> 27:42.245
Get up!

27:50.634 --> 27:53.775
♪ Do you hear
The big machines? ♪

27:53.810 --> 27:58.090
♪ All are peculiar beings ♪

28:09.308 --> 28:11.425
- Where the hell have you been?
- Sorry.

28:11.461 --> 28:13.670
You've got to get a cellphone.
Nobody could reach you.

28:13.706 --> 28:14.969
Nobody got to reach me.

28:15.003 --> 28:17.765
Well, I got to reach you.
Your lawyer's got to reach you.

28:17.979 --> 28:20.464
And why you got a lawyer?
Why is he calling here?

28:21.769 --> 28:23.598
- No, don't...
- Wyatt.

28:23.632 --> 28:24.806
You don't use this one.

28:24.841 --> 28:26.877
There's office phone,
use that one.

28:27.222 --> 28:28.222
Shit.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.883
Dyer Link for Improvement.

28:33.297 --> 28:34.436
Give me Dyer.

28:34.471 --> 28:36.197
And who might I say is calling?

28:36.231 --> 28:37.370
Angie Simms.

28:37.785 --> 28:39.096
Please hold.

28:51.488 --> 28:53.490
- Angie.
- Hello.

28:53.524 --> 28:54.629
All right now,

28:54.663 --> 28:56.079
There's no legal grounds
for this,

28:56.113 --> 28:57.666
so I really can't help you

28:57.701 --> 28:59.945
but, if you want to
pursuit it on your own,

28:59.979 --> 29:02.085
it's kind of up to you.

29:02.378 --> 29:06.710
People who are in your
financial situation

29:06.745 --> 29:09.368
almost never file civil suit.

29:09.784 --> 29:13.821
But, I looked
into Mr. Watkins, anyway.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.961
And it turned up a suit
between him

29:15.995 --> 29:18.446
and a local family
who got a daughter,

29:18.480 --> 29:20.551
little bit older than you.

29:21.003 --> 29:23.762
She's not young enough
but it could be a start.

29:24.253 --> 29:27.213
The case was dropped which could
mean, geez, any number of things.

29:27.248 --> 29:30.423
But, it was filed
by a Miron Needham.

29:32.046 --> 29:33.116
Kaylee.

29:35.843 --> 29:37.085
His daughter.

29:38.259 --> 29:39.363
I knew her.

29:44.748 --> 29:46.957
Your face looks
exactly the same.

29:49.339 --> 29:50.547
I was lucky, I guess.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.343
My parents believed me.

29:55.923 --> 29:59.996
They didn't have any money
but, they didn't care.

30:02.904 --> 30:05.286
They found someone who would
represent me for free.

30:06.429 --> 30:08.293
He came running real quick.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.675
He'd do anything
not to go to court.

30:12.303 --> 30:14.745
Something like that
can ruin you for life.

30:15.592 --> 30:18.802
Paid for my nurses aid training
with the settlement we got.

30:20.396 --> 30:22.605
You don't remember
anyone else, do you?

30:23.397 --> 30:25.503
There was a girl
few year older than us.

30:26.248 --> 30:28.146
I remember seeing her
around a bunch.

30:28.679 --> 30:29.714
Emily.

30:30.014 --> 30:31.394
Sad.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.329
Pretty sure that kept going on
till she was out of high school.

30:35.626 --> 30:37.180
She was older when it happened?

30:38.664 --> 30:41.046
Didn't stop with me
till I was 15.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.981
Age don't matter
to these people.

30:45.740 --> 30:47.086
It's not about sex.

30:48.221 --> 30:49.533
It's about power.

30:52.252 --> 30:55.669
You don't remember
anyone younger?

30:57.506 --> 31:00.474
That could be under 23 now.

31:01.308 --> 31:04.276
I mean, there is a girl

31:04.425 --> 31:07.355
but I don't know for sure
anything happened.

31:07.796 --> 31:09.453
But I remember
seeing her around.

31:10.627 --> 31:11.628
Pam.

31:12.801 --> 31:13.975
Pam.

31:15.571 --> 31:17.297
You remember anything else
about her?

31:18.859 --> 31:20.171
Blonde hair.

31:21.439 --> 31:22.474
Blue eyes.

31:26.960 --> 31:30.309
There's a get-together I go to
with some other survivors.

31:31.417 --> 31:32.453
We talk.

31:35.583 --> 31:36.687
You should come some time.

31:38.940 --> 31:42.081
Got to survive first before you
can call yourself a survivor.

31:45.288 --> 31:46.288
Hey.

31:48.403 --> 31:50.543
You don't remember
that ring, do you?

31:51.613 --> 31:52.752
With the red stone?

31:53.981 --> 31:56.500
You know, it's been
so many years but,

31:56.690 --> 31:58.657
sometimes I close my eyes,

32:00.988 --> 32:03.093
that ring
is the only thing I see.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.500
Just let me know
when you are finished.

32:21.108 --> 32:22.351
Thank you, Pastor.

32:32.076 --> 32:35.310
Hi, I'm looking to speak to Pam.
Is she there?

32:36.230 --> 32:37.230
Pam?

32:38.823 --> 32:40.446
All right, thank you.
Wrong number.

32:41.752 --> 32:42.995
Hi, is Pam there?

32:44.065 --> 32:45.860
Hi, I'm looking for Pam.

32:45.894 --> 32:47.896
Hi, I'm looking for Pam.
Is she there?

32:47.931 --> 32:48.967
Hi, is Pam there?

32:49.001 --> 32:50.347
Hi, I am looking for Pam.
Can you--

32:50.382 --> 32:51.900
Is Pam there?
Pam? Pam? Pam?

32:51.935 --> 32:52.971
She is.

32:54.627 --> 32:55.627
Um...

32:56.560 --> 32:58.666
Yeah, hi. This is Angie.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.150
Yeah.

33:02.186 --> 33:04.465
Um, yeah. I am an old friend
of hers from high school

33:04.499 --> 33:09.573
and I'm in town visiting and
thought to give her a call.

33:11.058 --> 33:13.370
I'm looking for Pam McKinney.

33:15.639 --> 33:16.891
What time
was your appointment at?

33:16.925 --> 33:19.031
I don't... I am not here
for an appointment.

33:19.066 --> 33:21.033
I just need to speak to Pam.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.360
Oh, okay.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.073
Hold on just one moment.

33:37.084 --> 33:38.154
Can I help you?

33:39.086 --> 33:41.295
- You Pam?
- Yeah, how can I help you?

33:43.952 --> 33:47.370
Your father told me
I could find you here.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.205
We went to church together
when we were kids.

33:56.482 --> 33:58.174
I'm older.

33:58.208 --> 34:01.418
I'm sorry. I'm at work.
Is there something you need?

34:02.730 --> 34:05.215
Is there some place
we could speak in private?

34:10.047 --> 34:11.290
What is this about?

34:14.672 --> 34:15.672
Thank you.

34:28.306 --> 34:30.447
I know how weird this must be.

34:34.969 --> 34:36.867
I got a three-year-old.

34:38.041 --> 34:42.080
And we just found out
we got to move and...

34:42.114 --> 34:44.322
Lady, I don't have any money.

34:44.358 --> 34:46.705
- No, no, no, no, that not--
- Then what do you want?

34:48.983 --> 34:50.260
You remember a girl

34:51.399 --> 34:54.195
on the back lawn at church
when we were kids?

34:55.610 --> 34:57.060
Girl named Kaylee.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.613
Or, or, Emily.

34:59.476 --> 35:01.271
She was older.

35:02.997 --> 35:04.309
She was older.

35:08.658 --> 35:10.280
Do you remember
a man named Bruce?

35:13.076 --> 35:14.422
I don't know but,

35:15.596 --> 35:17.184
maybe you knew him.

35:18.564 --> 35:21.049
Maybe you knew him in the
same way like I knew him.

35:21.084 --> 35:23.983
And, law's around here that

35:24.018 --> 35:25.364
you could only do
something about it

35:25.399 --> 35:27.021
within five years
of it happening,

35:27.055 --> 35:28.402
or five years of turning 18

35:28.436 --> 35:31.267
and I think you still got
a few months left of that,

35:31.301 --> 35:36.168
and it would be your last
chance at doing something.

35:36.203 --> 35:39.585
If anything happened
and you were one, too,

35:39.620 --> 35:43.244
and, in fact, it would be
all of our last chance

35:44.107 --> 35:47.904
at doing something together.

35:47.938 --> 35:51.356
You wouldn't even have to sue him.
We could just threaten him.

35:51.390 --> 35:53.599
So, he'd pay us to
not sue him and,

35:53.634 --> 35:55.774
I don't know, you could do
whatever you want with the money

35:55.808 --> 35:59.467
and, I could get a place
for my kid to live and,

36:00.158 --> 36:01.331
we could...

36:03.816 --> 36:04.852
...stop him.

36:09.339 --> 36:10.892
So, you want me
to threaten to sue him

36:10.927 --> 36:13.274
so you could get the money
to get a new place to live?

36:15.966 --> 36:16.967
Yeah.

36:19.246 --> 36:21.420
What the fuck is wrong
with you, lady?

36:22.835 --> 36:24.216
You think I may or may not

36:24.251 --> 36:25.631
have had some
sort of experience like you

36:25.666 --> 36:27.737
and that makes us,
what, blood brothers?

36:29.739 --> 36:31.982
You have got something
sick going on in your head

36:32.017 --> 36:33.536
and I don't want
no part of that.

36:34.122 --> 36:35.572
Okay.

36:35.607 --> 36:37.298
- This is my son!
- Please! Don't!

36:37.333 --> 36:38.472
I know it might not mean
much to you

36:38.506 --> 36:39.921
but you are living
on the edge of a cliff,

36:39.956 --> 36:41.233
and one thing goes wrong,
one thing,

36:41.268 --> 36:42.924
and that's what happened.

36:42.959 --> 36:45.203
And I can fuck up my own life
as much as I want

36:45.237 --> 36:47.964
but I can't have my little boy
being homeless.

36:49.448 --> 36:52.037
So this is, what, your solution?

36:52.071 --> 36:54.142
This is your plan
to save your son?

36:54.177 --> 36:56.144
Lady, I don't even know you

36:56.179 --> 36:57.698
and you come here asking me

36:57.732 --> 37:00.977
to pick away the scabs that I've
had healed for a long time,

37:01.011 --> 37:02.011
for you?

37:02.461 --> 37:03.738
I got myself into school.

37:03.773 --> 37:07.086
I got myself a job.
Nobody did shit for me.

37:07.121 --> 37:08.398
I didn't sit around crying about

37:08.433 --> 37:11.332
what did or didn't happen
or whatever.

37:13.955 --> 37:15.509
He's just gonna keep doing it.

37:21.273 --> 37:22.481
You know, it's real interesting

37:22.516 --> 37:24.449
you want to stop him
now that you need the money.

37:26.485 --> 37:27.555
Would have been really cool

37:27.590 --> 37:28.660
if you tried and stop him
back in the day

37:28.694 --> 37:30.294
before I had the pleasure
of meeting him.

37:41.051 --> 37:42.051
Fuck.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.621
Why does it smell like gas?

37:59.656 --> 38:00.726
Mom?

38:02.556 --> 38:03.591
Trey, no.

38:03.626 --> 38:07.457
No, no. Look at me.
That's dangerous, okay?

38:07.492 --> 38:09.183
Okay? What happens
when Mama lights her cigarettes?

38:09.217 --> 38:10.322
Do you hear me?

38:10.357 --> 38:11.634
Okay? Okay?

38:11.668 --> 38:13.981
That's dangerous.
I told you. Look at this.

38:14.015 --> 38:16.155
No, this is dangerous, okay?

38:16.190 --> 38:18.054
Look at me. Do you hear me?

38:18.088 --> 38:19.676
Okay, okay, okay.

38:19.711 --> 38:21.333
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

38:21.368 --> 38:23.715
It's okay, it's okay. Shh.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.889
It's okay.

38:25.924 --> 38:27.063
Shh.

38:30.066 --> 38:31.343
Thanks.

38:31.378 --> 38:32.482
Jesus Christ.

38:32.517 --> 38:35.036
Angie, you can not keep
doing this to me.

38:35.071 --> 38:36.279
This ain't a daycare.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.177
Wyatt. Couldn't find
a babysitter.

38:38.212 --> 38:39.455
Did you just...

38:39.489 --> 38:41.664
- Oh, my God.
- What?

38:42.837 --> 38:45.253
We used to have to play with her
back when we were little.

38:45.288 --> 38:46.807
It's so weird.

38:46.841 --> 38:48.498
Working at the clinic store.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.155
Like mama, like daughter.

38:50.189 --> 38:51.432
Somebody has to.

38:52.157 --> 38:53.296
Stop.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.504
She'd fuck anything
with a dick too,

38:54.539 --> 38:55.919
just like her mama.

38:58.094 --> 38:59.854
She don't even know
who the daddy is.

38:59.889 --> 39:02.029
Some trucker passing through.

39:02.063 --> 39:03.651
That's disgusting.

39:03.686 --> 39:06.447
How else do you think you
get a black baby like that?

39:06.861 --> 39:08.000
God, Geena...

39:11.141 --> 39:12.141
Come on, baby.

39:13.212 --> 39:14.386
Jesus!

39:14.421 --> 39:16.733
Did you see what that
crazy ass did to her?

39:16.768 --> 39:18.597
What the fuck, Angie?

39:20.047 --> 39:22.049
Don't you ever come back here!

39:22.083 --> 39:23.119
You hear me?

39:23.947 --> 39:24.983
Go home!

39:26.364 --> 39:28.124
You got to go to him
and get the money.

39:28.538 --> 39:30.644
- Go to hell.
- Bruce.

39:32.853 --> 39:35.407
I tried a bunch of ways
and now it's your turn.

39:39.135 --> 39:40.170
Hello?

39:42.345 --> 39:44.761
If you weren't so wasted
out of your mind all the time,

39:44.796 --> 39:46.867
maybe the electrician
wouldn't have ratted us out.

39:46.901 --> 39:47.868
Okay, no, he didn't.

39:47.902 --> 39:49.559
What the hell do you think
happened then?

39:49.594 --> 39:51.492
You better get yourself
some sleep.

39:51.527 --> 39:52.838
Okay, I don't have a job.

39:52.873 --> 39:54.909
We are not allowed
to be here anymore.

39:54.944 --> 39:56.463
What do you mean
you got no job no more?

39:56.497 --> 39:58.534
It's not like it was paying
enough anyway.

39:58.568 --> 40:00.363
I can't afford all this
on my disability.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.330
You don't have disability
anymore!

40:02.365 --> 40:04.022
Yeah, I do. They owe me
all that back pay--

40:04.056 --> 40:05.679
No, you don't!
They don't owe you nothing!

40:05.713 --> 40:07.750
Oh, they owe me that back pain
and I'm fighting for it.

40:07.784 --> 40:09.924
You are living in a dream world!

40:09.959 --> 40:12.858
My whole life, you are just
sitting around pretending.

40:12.893 --> 40:14.342
Thinking some other life
is happening

40:14.377 --> 40:17.553
and some big party out there for
you to dance the night away at,

40:17.587 --> 40:19.693
when I am in here,
the whole time

40:19.727 --> 40:21.004
and you never did nothing.

40:21.039 --> 40:22.627
I put food in your belly.

40:22.661 --> 40:24.283
I put a roof over your head.

40:24.318 --> 40:26.009
- I needed you to be here.
- I did that.

40:26.044 --> 40:28.874
I needed you to see
what I've been going through.

40:30.497 --> 40:32.637
Maybe I could have
gone somewhere,

40:32.671 --> 40:34.121
turned out different.

40:43.717 --> 40:44.717
God...

40:48.204 --> 40:49.619
If it wasn't for Trey,

40:52.208 --> 40:53.451
I don't think I...

40:56.384 --> 40:58.179
I don't think
I'd be here anymore.

41:00.009 --> 41:01.009
Now, come on.

41:02.183 --> 41:03.183
Stop that.

41:04.634 --> 41:06.498
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

41:10.191 --> 41:11.261
Go to Bruce.

41:16.335 --> 41:18.510
You brought him into this
house in the first place.

41:18.545 --> 41:20.581
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Just thinking about yourself.

41:20.616 --> 41:23.032
- Just wanting a good fuck.
- Okay, that's disgusting.

41:23.066 --> 41:25.586
I came to you and I told you
what he did to me.

41:25.621 --> 41:28.278
I told you and you told me
I was lying.

41:28.313 --> 41:29.452
He didn't do nothing to you.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.350
He put his fucking fingers
inside me!

41:31.385 --> 41:32.420
You are always making shit up!

41:32.455 --> 41:33.801
In the back lawn
of that fucking church!

41:33.836 --> 41:35.389
And in your bedroom
when you were in shower!

41:35.423 --> 41:36.528
Screaming for attention.

41:36.563 --> 41:38.323
I can name three other girls
he did this to.

41:38.357 --> 41:40.739
- You just didn't want me to be happy.
- I can name three other girls.

41:40.774 --> 41:42.983
Any man I ever brought up,
were never good enough for you!

41:43.017 --> 41:45.537
You hated every single
one of them.

41:45.572 --> 41:47.988
- Well, I'm sorry...
- Emily Winslow.

41:48.022 --> 41:49.507
...that I protected you.

41:49.541 --> 41:50.611
Kaylee Needham.

41:50.646 --> 41:52.026
You didn't know
what was going on.

41:52.061 --> 41:53.027
Pam McKinney.

41:53.062 --> 41:55.340
You didn't know
what I protected you from.

41:55.374 --> 41:56.790
You were too young.

41:56.824 --> 41:58.861
You didn't know
what I protected you from!

42:18.708 --> 42:19.882
You don't know.

42:21.193 --> 42:23.023
You don't know.

42:23.713 --> 42:25.163
You don't know.

42:25.750 --> 42:27.579
You show up here pregnant

42:27.614 --> 42:30.582
not even knowing
what the daddy's name was.

42:31.445 --> 42:33.585
I was there for you.

42:33.620 --> 42:35.587
You think you got touched?

42:35.967 --> 42:37.796
Once, twice.

42:37.831 --> 42:42.767
Gee, hell, I got raped
by my uncle for 15 years.

42:42.801 --> 42:45.355
Please, you got off easy.

42:46.978 --> 42:49.877
You know the last time
I saw your daddy was?

42:49.912 --> 42:51.776
When I told him
I was pregnant with you,

42:51.810 --> 42:54.088
he slipped town right quick.

42:54.123 --> 42:56.884
And everybody told me
I should get an abortion

42:56.919 --> 42:59.266
even though they say
they're Christian.

42:59.300 --> 43:02.303
Tell me how fucked up
you were going to turn out.

43:05.652 --> 43:08.171
When I had you inside me,

43:09.276 --> 43:11.934
ain't nobody gonna take you
away from me.

43:14.212 --> 43:19.010
I wanted to know what it
felt like to be loved.

43:23.980 --> 43:25.395
I had your love.

in the middle of the street.

44:48.409 --> 44:49.409
Miss, wer...

44:51.205 --> 44:52.241
Angie?

44:55.244 --> 44:56.348
Everything okay?

44:59.075 --> 45:02.941
Uh, why don't you just
pull it in here.

45:04.080 --> 45:06.117
I'll make you some coffee.

45:06.151 --> 45:07.151
All right?

45:38.666 --> 45:41.946
I put some coffee on the brew.

45:41.980 --> 45:45.018
Just gonna run up
and throw some clothes on.

45:46.226 --> 45:48.746
You need anything, like, shower?

45:50.782 --> 45:51.956
Good.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.545
Okay, then.

45:55.580 --> 45:59.929
Uh, when the coffee is ready,
go ahead and help yourself.

46:51.670 --> 46:53.811
Oh, good. You got some coffee.

47:05.857 --> 47:07.859
How do you know Wyatt?

47:07.894 --> 47:12.036
Uh, his dad and I
are basically cousins.

47:13.934 --> 47:16.350
Wyatt's daughter
is my goddaughter.

47:22.132 --> 47:25.549
So, I think it's been

47:27.238 --> 47:30.724
at least five years since you and
me even run into each other, no?

47:32.711 --> 47:33.920
Sounds right.

47:35.636 --> 47:37.707
Good Lord, what happened
to your hand?

47:37.743 --> 47:40.712
Oh, uh, I burnt it cooking.

47:53.767 --> 47:54.906
Oh, no. I...

47:54.941 --> 47:57.150
Well, I insist.
That looks terrible.

47:58.512 --> 47:59.754
You just hush.

48:02.569 --> 48:03.570
That's my girl.

48:05.952 --> 48:08.644
So, everything okay?

48:13.649 --> 48:16.963
It's been a rough few days.

48:19.191 --> 48:20.468
Is your mom okay?

48:22.623 --> 48:23.935
Uh, yeah, she's, um...

48:26.136 --> 48:28.517
No, she's, she's not great.

48:30.597 --> 48:31.909
Cancer's gone, but.

48:32.944 --> 48:36.292
Can't stop her
from smoking, drinking.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.193
I'm taking care of her.

48:40.848 --> 48:42.264
Well, you gotta.

48:44.093 --> 48:46.199
Give her my best.

48:46.569 --> 48:48.640
I always just thought
world of your mother.

48:52.274 --> 48:54.172
You didn't got
disability no more.

48:54.207 --> 48:58.245
And, I only got about
$40 to my name and,

48:59.271 --> 49:00.790
we found out we gotta move

49:01.835 --> 49:04.182
and we've got no where to go.

49:08.010 --> 49:09.011
Well,

49:10.370 --> 49:12.475
darling, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

49:14.848 --> 49:18.162
Y'all can stay here
for a little till

49:19.991 --> 49:21.337
you're back on your feet.

49:22.373 --> 49:23.443
That's, um,

49:24.651 --> 49:26.032
that's really nice of you.

49:27.516 --> 49:29.725
I don't think
my mom would go for that.

49:30.277 --> 49:31.278
No.

49:31.313 --> 49:33.004
You know how she is.
She is

49:34.109 --> 49:36.490
so proud. You can't talk
her into nothing.

49:38.182 --> 49:40.011
She can't even know
I was here, you know.

49:40.598 --> 49:41.737
Yeah, poor thing.

49:41.771 --> 49:43.842
She never gonna change.

49:43.877 --> 49:45.154
Well, that's our little secret.

49:47.708 --> 49:51.712
I found this place and,

49:53.197 --> 49:54.612
it can be a good deal but,

49:56.200 --> 49:58.133
I don't got the $1700 down.

50:01.826 --> 50:03.103
All better.

50:06.366 --> 50:09.783
I didn't know where else to go

50:11.525 --> 50:12.526
for help.

50:27.627 --> 50:30.008
It makes me feel so good
to know you trust me.

50:34.252 --> 50:35.840
$1700, you say.

50:38.690 --> 50:39.690
Yeah.

50:55.811 --> 50:56.960
Made out to you.

50:59.504 --> 51:00.505
Yeah.

51:01.713 --> 51:02.713
Angela.

51:08.444 --> 51:11.102
It means the world to me
that you came here.

51:12.793 --> 51:14.864
I've thought about you
all these years and I,

51:14.899 --> 51:16.314
I wanted to be in touch.

51:17.492 --> 51:18.907
But your mom went crazy.

51:21.144 --> 51:23.664
I would do anything to help you,
you know that, right?

51:25.461 --> 51:26.462
Hm-mm.

51:27.301 --> 51:29.579
Your mother was out,

51:29.718 --> 51:32.227
God knows where
till God knows when,

51:32.492 --> 51:34.953
and she'd come home
so strung out from the drug,

51:34.988 --> 51:37.680
she didn't even remember
your name.

51:37.715 --> 51:40.338
And I didn't know what that
kind of thing could do to you

51:40.373 --> 51:42.099
so I stayed with you.

51:44.135 --> 51:45.378
I protected you.

51:46.689 --> 51:47.689
Remember?

51:51.425 --> 51:52.599
Yeah.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.230
It's okay.

52:14.061 --> 52:15.615
All okay.

52:22.104 --> 52:26.177
It would be an honor if you could
let me take you out for dinner.

52:27.316 --> 52:28.662
We'd go somewhere nice.

52:28.697 --> 52:31.596
There's a French place
just opened up in Middletown.

52:36.670 --> 52:37.809
I have a big heart.

52:39.259 --> 52:41.399
But I want you to know that,

52:41.434 --> 52:43.643
that I've never loved anyone

52:45.369 --> 52:46.369
else

52:47.025 --> 52:48.372
as much as I love you.

52:50.512 --> 52:53.825
And I want a chance
to show that to you.

52:56.545 --> 52:57.994
See, in my heart of hearts

52:58.060 --> 53:00.096
I've always known
you feel the same way.

53:03.076 --> 53:04.076
Angie.

53:05.009 --> 53:06.009
What...

53:06.976 --> 53:07.976
Where are you going?

53:08.599 --> 53:09.634
I have to...

53:10.877 --> 53:13.224
You don't want to go out
for dinner with me.

53:14.156 --> 53:16.469
I do. I would, I just...

53:17.608 --> 53:18.643
Can we still...

53:19.368 --> 53:20.473
Will you still...

53:20.507 --> 53:22.233
You want me to give you
the money

53:22.268 --> 53:24.856
but you don't want
to go out to dinner with me?

53:26.272 --> 53:27.307
I just...

53:27.342 --> 53:29.033
I don't have a lot
of money, Angie.

53:29.067 --> 53:31.242
I just... You said
you needed it

53:31.277 --> 53:34.003
so I wanted to help you out.

53:34.038 --> 53:36.213
- I, because I care about--
- Don't!

55:02.851 --> 55:03.852
Hello?

55:06.441 --> 55:07.718
Anybody home?

55:12.378 --> 55:13.482
How can I help you?

55:13.517 --> 55:14.828
Ma'am, do you realize

55:14.863 --> 55:17.417
it's illegal for you
to be residing in this home.

55:18.384 --> 55:20.386
Yeah, yeah. I know
we gotta leave soon.

55:20.420 --> 55:21.939
No, you should've left already.

55:21.973 --> 55:24.286
What part of "condemn"
do you don't understand?

55:24.321 --> 55:25.598
Okay, all right. All right.

55:27.116 --> 55:28.670
Whose kid is that?

55:28.704 --> 55:29.533
He's mine.

55:29.567 --> 55:30.879
You have a black kid?

55:31.328 --> 55:32.329
Yeah.

55:32.363 --> 55:33.364
What is it your business?

55:33.399 --> 55:35.124
It's my business
if you have a kid

55:35.159 --> 55:36.367
in a toxic environment.

55:36.402 --> 55:37.920
- Okay.
- Is he still your kid now?

55:38.818 --> 55:39.819
Yeah.

55:39.853 --> 55:41.372
You ever heard
of child protective services?

55:41.407 --> 55:42.684
Get him out of here.

55:43.857 --> 55:44.857
Okay.

55:45.963 --> 55:47.896
Okay, honey. Here we go.

55:49.069 --> 55:50.069
Ma'am?

55:50.864 --> 55:51.969
Hello?

55:52.003 --> 55:54.083
- Here we go.
- Ma'am, I need you to wake up.

55:54.972 --> 55:56.111
Who gives a fuck?

55:56.145 --> 55:57.492
It's Sheriff Stevens.

55:57.526 --> 56:00.874
I need you to get up, get your things.
Let's go!

56:07.156 --> 56:10.228
Look, I'm going to give you till
1:00 p.m. to get your stuff out.

56:10.263 --> 56:11.506

to me in here?

57:53.711 --> 57:56.645
Oh, God. Look at you.

57:56.680 --> 57:58.578
What did you do to yourself?

58:02.340 --> 58:03.756
Look at this mess.

58:04.757 --> 58:06.793
We're suppose to be packing

58:06.828 --> 58:09.140
and you just making it worse.

58:09.175 --> 58:10.797
Why are you doing that to me?

58:12.385 --> 58:13.973
I wanted to look
just like mommy.

58:19.841 --> 58:22.913
All right, now.
You just sit right there.

58:22.947 --> 58:25.709
I'm going to explain
something to you, okay?

58:26.537 --> 58:27.780
You listen to me.

58:30.955 --> 58:32.336
You see this?

58:32.370 --> 58:33.544
You know what that is?

58:33.579 --> 58:34.752
Is that beauty mark?

58:34.787 --> 58:36.823
Yeah, that's a beauty mark.

58:37.375 --> 58:39.619
God gave me that

58:39.654 --> 58:42.967
to remind me
that no matter what,

58:43.002 --> 58:47.144
I got a little bit of beauty
inside me, okay?

58:47.938 --> 58:49.318
But sometimes,

58:49.353 --> 58:52.736
God, he'd make a soul that is

58:52.770 --> 58:56.981
so beautiful and so glorious

58:57.016 --> 59:01.814
that he just gotta show you
on to the whole darn world.

59:02.366 --> 59:04.541
And that is you.

59:04.575 --> 59:08.890
You, is God showing off
how good he done.

59:53.141 --> 59:56.351
Hey, Lorraine. It's Angie.

59:57.421 --> 59:58.629
You got a minute?

01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:13.057
Hey, girl. Get your ass inside.

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:14.127
You remember Billy?

01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:16.336
Thanks for letting us stay.

01:00:17.303 --> 01:00:18.303
It's her place.

01:00:21.341 --> 01:00:22.273
- Lorraine, I--
- No.

01:00:22.308 --> 01:00:23.654
Already know
what a good deed I'm doing,

01:00:23.689 --> 01:00:25.242
I don't need you to confirm it.

01:00:25.276 --> 01:00:26.105
Okay.

01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:27.727
Got to looking you good.
Get in there.

01:00:28.452 --> 01:00:29.729
Show her what's what.

01:00:48.610 --> 01:00:49.646
Seriously?

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:04.695
What time are you back?

01:01:28.408 --> 01:01:29.408
Ray.

01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:31.065
This is Angie.

01:01:31.895 --> 01:01:32.723
Who?

01:01:32.758 --> 01:01:34.552
The girl I told you about.

01:01:34.587 --> 01:01:37.141
Oh, Angie.
Let's see your stuff.

01:01:37.832 --> 01:01:39.074
Take your coat off.

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:47.945
Turn around.

01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:56.713
Nice. Let's see the rest.

01:01:58.784 --> 01:01:59.957
Take your dress down.

01:02:11.072 --> 01:02:13.177
All right. Turn around.

01:02:14.696 --> 01:02:16.111
Turn around.

01:02:19.943 --> 01:02:21.496
Orlo, you like that?

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:22.773
Oh, yeah.

01:02:22.808 --> 01:02:24.464
I'll fix $20 a night.

01:02:24.499 --> 01:02:25.914
That's okay.

01:02:25.949 --> 01:02:28.468
Plus, you got to tip out Steve
on lights and Jimmy at the door.

01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:29.987
You are going up tonight, honey?

01:02:32.265 --> 01:02:34.164
You ain't gotta go now
if you don't want to.

01:02:39.479 --> 01:02:40.515
You ready for me, Orlo.

01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:43.863
Watch your step, honey.

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:12.581
Right here.

01:03:27.148 --> 01:03:30.013
How many guys want to see
take her dress off?

01:03:34.672 --> 01:03:36.364
Hey. Hey, hey, y'all, y'all.

01:03:36.398 --> 01:03:37.710
Calm down, calm down.

01:03:37.744 --> 01:03:38.884
Just give her some money

01:03:38.918 --> 01:03:40.782
and be happy you got
a hot new one

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.370
instead, one of those
ugly ass ones

01:03:42.404 --> 01:03:43.578
from down the street.

01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:08.914

I know.

01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:18.845
Let's go. It's 6:00 a.m.
I need some breakfast.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.331
Lorraine,
I can't thank you enough.

01:05:21.365 --> 01:05:24.851
Well, you can thank me by getting
your family off my damn floor.

01:05:24.886 --> 01:05:25.991
My place ain't that big.

01:05:26.025 --> 01:05:28.579
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm gonna get us a place

01:05:28.614 --> 01:05:29.856
as soon as it all adds up.

01:05:30.443 --> 01:05:32.135
No, girl, I can't.

01:05:33.343 --> 01:05:35.552
Billy don't like
a house guest that much.

01:05:36.691 --> 01:05:37.934
You know what I mean.

01:05:38.555 --> 01:05:39.556
You know I love you,

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.385
but you got to leave
in just couple of days.

01:05:42.076 --> 01:05:44.319
Oh, okay, I just...

01:05:44.354 --> 01:05:47.978
I don't know if it's going
to be couple of days.

01:05:48.013 --> 01:05:50.222
Well, then you better start
taking that top off

01:05:50.256 --> 01:05:52.051
in the back room, little lady.

01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:14.832
And how much longer
they are going to be here?

01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:16.144
What do you mean you don't know?

01:06:16.179 --> 01:06:17.490
Two days! Two days!

01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:19.630
- Now you want more?
- I know. I know.

01:06:19.665 --> 01:06:21.218
Well, how long
this is going to be?

01:06:21.253 --> 01:06:23.565
I'm not going to live here
with some old alcoholic

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.947
and this half-breed kid running
around in the fucking house.

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:26.983
Would you be quiet!

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:28.570
Hey, don't tell me
what the fuck I have...

01:06:28.605 --> 01:06:30.917
Don't you talk to me
like that, woman!

01:06:30.952 --> 01:06:33.575
Hey, come here!

01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:37.131
Why don't you just bring some more people
to move in my fucking house, Lorraine?

01:06:37.165 --> 01:06:39.478
Your fucking ASPCA.

01:06:39.512 --> 01:06:40.824
- God!
- Come on.

01:06:40.858 --> 01:06:42.239
We are going to be late.

01:06:42.274 --> 01:06:43.585
I'm almost ready.

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.656
I ain't got time for "almost
ready." We got to go now.

01:06:45.691 --> 01:06:47.486
You got to give her a break.
She's working--

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.971
Listen, lady, I don't need to lecture
me about nothing right now, okay?

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.352
I was just saying she's trying.

01:06:51.386 --> 01:06:53.147
Why don't you go out
and get a job

01:06:53.181 --> 01:06:55.942
and act like a good mother for once
instead of telling me what to do.

01:06:55.977 --> 01:06:57.530
I have been a good mother.

01:06:57.565 --> 01:06:58.600
Oh, yeah, real good.

01:06:58.635 --> 01:07:01.258
I didn't make her
become a damn stripper.

01:07:01.293 --> 01:07:03.019
It's more than
you've done for her.

01:07:03.053 --> 01:07:05.262
Waiting on some imaginary
disability check.

01:07:05.297 --> 01:07:07.713
It ain't imaginary.
I am disabled.

01:07:07.747 --> 01:07:08.852
I can't work.

01:07:08.886 --> 01:07:10.060
You look real disabled.

01:07:10.095 --> 01:07:11.786
- What's going on?
- How does it feel

01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:15.928
living off your daughter
when your family needs you?

01:07:15.962 --> 01:07:20.553
What does it feel like to be
sitting there so damn useless?

01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:25.110
You disgust me.

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:56.520
Hi, Brucey.

01:07:58.971 --> 01:08:00.248
Long time, huh?

01:08:03.734 --> 01:08:04.734
Drive.

01:08:11.156 --> 01:08:12.916
What are you doing
at Lorraine's house?

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:14.400
You know Lorraine?

01:08:14.435 --> 01:08:16.368
Everybody knows Lorraine.

01:08:17.368 --> 01:08:19.819
Angie got a job with her,
you know.

01:08:20.924 --> 01:08:22.236
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:24.169
Real nice office job.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.618
Hmm.

01:08:26.654 --> 01:08:29.587
Yes. So, I need...

01:08:31.486 --> 01:08:35.283
Thank you for coming
all the way over here.

01:08:35.318 --> 01:08:38.459
I know he ain't seen these
in a long time.

01:08:40.219 --> 01:08:42.635
I know we didn't end too good.

01:08:44.223 --> 01:08:46.743
- No, we didn't.
- No.

01:08:46.777 --> 01:08:49.228
We did not end too good.

01:08:52.197 --> 01:08:55.060
Oh, God, we did not
end too good.

01:08:55.095 --> 01:08:56.580
You know,

01:08:57.546 --> 01:08:59.687
I'm in the thick of it now and,

01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:02.276
you know,

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:05.381
we had something back then,
me and you, Brucy.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:07.176
What are you in the thick of?

01:09:07.212 --> 01:09:09.662
Oh, you are not
going to believe it.

01:09:09.697 --> 01:09:12.837
There's some mess out there
on the system with my check

01:09:12.872 --> 01:09:16.220
and, if it's not one thing
with the government,

01:09:16.255 --> 01:09:17.600
it is another.

01:09:18.395 --> 01:09:20.328
So, Angie is taking care
of her kid

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:24.814
so, now I'm the only one
bringing in anything and,

01:09:25.747 --> 01:09:27.645
you know, so I just...

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:31.581
- So, we out of the house now.
- Hmm.

01:09:31.615 --> 01:09:34.446
And Lorraine was nice enough
to give us her living room

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:38.312
but, we can't be staying all
on top of each other like that.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:41.970
So, you know,
I just thought maybe

01:09:43.662 --> 01:09:47.769
I could borrow a little bit
from you.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:51.462
Just a little bit.
I'll pay you back.

01:09:53.085 --> 01:09:54.397
How much we are talking?

01:09:55.052 --> 01:09:58.953
Oh, uh, like, um, $1700.

01:10:02.474 --> 01:10:03.889
That's a lot of money.

01:10:03.923 --> 01:10:05.201
Oh, you know, I'm good for it.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.410
I'll pay you back
in a couple of months.

01:10:07.444 --> 01:10:09.239
I don't, you know,

01:10:09.274 --> 01:10:14.417
I'm sorry but I don't really have
that kind of cash, just like that.

01:10:15.556 --> 01:10:17.213
Oh, okay.

01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:20.975
Um, well, you know maybe,
I don't know, um,

01:10:21.872 --> 01:10:24.047
you got a big house, right?

01:10:24.081 --> 01:10:27.119
So, maybe, I don't know

01:10:27.153 --> 01:10:29.397
we could stay with you
for a bit.

01:10:29.432 --> 01:10:32.193
Yeah, I don't think staying
with me is a good idea.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.436
It just...

01:10:34.644 --> 01:10:39.649
I, I'm not sure
that Angie really likes me so,

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:43.480
Yeah, right. Yeah.

01:10:43.963 --> 01:10:44.963
Yeah.

01:10:45.724 --> 01:10:46.724
Yeah.

01:10:51.764 --> 01:10:52.765
How are you, Brucey?

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.457
Hi, baby.

01:10:55.181 --> 01:10:56.390
All right, come on, baby.

01:10:56.424 --> 01:10:58.115
- What you...
- You know about it.

01:10:58.150 --> 01:10:59.220
- Oh, come on.
- No.

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:00.532
- No, wait.
- I'm going now.

01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:02.396
- Oh.
- Ruth Ann.

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:04.294
No, stop. Stop it. Ruth Ann!

01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:05.537
Ruth Ann, stop it.

01:11:05.571 --> 01:11:07.159
I ain't got nothing, Brucey.

01:11:07.193 --> 01:11:08.885
I ain't got no home
for me and the kids.

01:11:08.919 --> 01:11:10.473
I ain't got no cash.

01:11:10.507 --> 01:11:12.751
Nobody believes me.

01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:16.133
- Hi, Brucey, hi. Oh.
- Oh. Come on, honey.

01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:17.376
- Oh, yay.
- Oh, Jesus, no.

01:11:17.411 --> 01:11:19.861
Ruth Ann. You are going
to kill us. Stop!

01:11:21.794 --> 01:11:22.794
No.

01:11:23.451 --> 01:11:25.419
Look, I'm gonna
help you all out,

01:11:26.385 --> 01:11:28.249
'cause I just still care
about you.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.215
Okay.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.114
But, but,

01:11:31.148 --> 01:11:33.289
now you are saying
you need my help,

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:34.911
now I need your help, too.

01:11:34.945 --> 01:11:36.464
Just give me a sign, baby.

01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:38.915
Oh, that's nice, right?
You remember.

01:11:38.949 --> 01:11:40.606
- All right.
- Okay.

01:11:40.641 --> 01:11:42.125
- Whatever you want.
- I need your help, too.

01:11:42.159 --> 01:11:44.472
- Whatever you want.
- Okay. Okay.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:45.748
Okay.

01:11:46.612 --> 01:11:47.924
Oh, God.

01:11:49.753 --> 01:11:50.753
Oh.

01:11:56.726 --> 01:11:59.625
You know all these years
I've been thinking on it.

01:12:00.005 --> 01:12:01.696
And,

01:12:01.731 --> 01:12:05.459
it wasn't us that were suppose
to be together.

01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:07.633
And it wasn't you and me.

01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:09.635
Do you know what I mean?

01:12:20.059 --> 01:12:21.716
Pull over.

01:12:21.751 --> 01:12:23.684
Pull over.
I'll suck it 'till you dry.

01:12:24.167 --> 01:12:25.167
Oh.

01:12:25.686 --> 01:12:26.549
Pull over.

01:12:26.583 --> 01:12:28.023
Yeah.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:29.517
That's right.

01:12:31.795 --> 01:12:35.730
I scratch you
and you scratch me.

01:12:35.765 --> 01:12:37.732
- That's what you want, right?
- Yeah.

01:12:38.284 --> 01:12:40.183
Okay, all right.

01:12:40.217 --> 01:12:42.427
Then let's just make
a deal of it.

01:12:43.635 --> 01:12:45.257
- All right.
- Okay.

01:12:45.291 --> 01:12:49.537
Next time, I see you around her,

01:12:49.572 --> 01:12:53.541
same building, same block,
it don't matter where,

01:12:53.576 --> 01:12:55.923
'cause I'm just going
to come up to you

01:12:56.924 --> 01:12:57.924
and,

01:12:59.513 --> 01:13:00.721
and I'm just gonna,

01:13:01.825 --> 01:13:04.897
I'll slice
your fucking dick off.

01:13:20.257 --> 01:13:22.052
What do you think this is?
A 24 hours diner?

01:13:22.087 --> 01:13:24.261
You can just come in
whenever the hell you want?

01:13:24.296 --> 01:13:25.539
Hey, I tried to call.
Nobody answered.

01:13:25.573 --> 01:13:27.057
'Cause I ain't got nobody
on the phone

01:13:27.092 --> 01:13:28.127
'cause we can't afford it

01:13:28.162 --> 01:13:29.612
just like we can't afford
to have half our dancers

01:13:29.646 --> 01:13:31.096
come in here
whenever the hell they feel.

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:33.823
- I'm sorry, Ray, it was...
- We got a flat.

01:13:33.857 --> 01:13:36.964
And you are lucky,
we are such good employees

01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:39.656
that we left early otherwise
we wouldn't be here even now.

01:13:39.691 --> 01:13:40.864
Okay, just get this going,
all right.

01:13:40.899 --> 01:13:43.211
We got some blue balls
old geezers out there.

01:13:43.246 --> 01:13:44.246
Classy.

01:13:46.491 --> 01:13:48.389
You got to take your
own car from now on.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:49.770
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:13:49.804 --> 01:13:51.530
You know what,
I really want to help you

01:13:51.565 --> 01:13:54.222
but with your mom
and the kid and Billy,

01:13:54.257 --> 01:13:57.087
it's just too much for me
right now. Y'all need to go.

01:13:57.122 --> 01:13:59.952
Look, I don't have enough money
but as soon as I do--

01:13:59.987 --> 01:14:01.057
Angie, I can't.

01:15:32.804 --> 01:15:34.322
Lorraine, what the hell?

01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:37.049
- What the--
- I got it.

01:15:37.084 --> 01:15:39.068
I can't have my dancers
walking around--

01:15:39.104 --> 01:15:40.117
I got it!

01:15:44.712 --> 01:15:46.265
What the hell is going on?

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.750
- He's here.
- Who?

01:15:47.784 --> 01:15:48.889
The man I told you about.

01:15:48.923 --> 01:15:51.339
Do you know
what this looks like on me?

01:15:51.374 --> 01:15:52.271
I'm sorry.

01:15:52.306 --> 01:15:53.479
You ain't got no money!

01:15:53.514 --> 01:15:54.895
You can't just decide
not to do something

01:15:54.929 --> 01:15:56.655
when it ain't comfortable
for you.

01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:59.727
You kid is sleeping
on my damn floor right now.

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:04.836
I'm sorry.

01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:06.838
You know what,

01:16:07.908 --> 01:16:08.943
stay here.

01:16:10.635 --> 01:16:11.774
Where are you going?

01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:42.736
You got rid of him?

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:45.842
You got rid of him, right?

01:16:47.706 --> 01:16:49.328
Lorraine, I need him
thrown out of here.

01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:52.987
He said, "I'll give you $200
for private dance."

01:16:55.749 --> 01:16:57.095
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.132
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:17:03.688 --> 01:17:04.965
What do you want me to say?

01:17:05.759 --> 01:17:07.312
Tell him to go fuck himself!

01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:11.867
Go!

01:17:16.045 --> 01:17:17.045
Okay.

01:17:43.244 --> 01:17:44.244
Thank you.

01:17:45.453 --> 01:17:46.800
What? What happened?

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.941
He said $500.

01:17:53.599 --> 01:17:54.739
What?

01:17:55.878 --> 01:17:57.293
He's fucking disgusting.

01:17:57.983 --> 01:17:58.708
Fuck.

01:17:58.743 --> 01:18:00.020
It is just a dance.

01:18:00.054 --> 01:18:03.540
No, it's just not a dance.

01:18:03.575 --> 01:18:06.440
Tell him he should go fucking
rot in hell for what's he done.

01:18:08.131 --> 01:18:09.131
Tell him!

01:18:11.031 --> 01:18:12.031
Tell him.

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:17.208
Wait.

01:18:18.245 --> 01:18:19.245
Come back.

01:18:19.556 --> 01:18:20.765
Wait. Come back.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:27.737
Tell him...

01:18:32.086 --> 01:18:33.086
Tell him...

01:18:39.162 --> 01:18:42.338
Tell him $1700.

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.019
Here we go.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:57.549
We're home.

01:24:04.694 --> 01:24:06.213
Why are we here?

01:24:06.248 --> 01:24:07.421
This is our new home.

01:24:17.811 --> 01:24:19.916
No. No.

01:24:19.951 --> 01:24:21.573
There is nothing that
you can say to me.

01:24:22.264 --> 01:24:23.610
It's not about the job.

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.786
