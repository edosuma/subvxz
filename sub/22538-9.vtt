00:11.090 --> 00:12.690
Ray carling.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.670
What am I doing re with you swamp donkeys?

00:15.730 --> 00:17.450
Detective sam tyler of the 1-2-5 squad.

00:17.540 --> 00:19.090
Is this about the russians?

00:19.160 --> 00:21.610
'Cause I put everything I know into my report.

00:22.970 --> 00:30.560
Case number 6-2-4-5-3 concerning the disappearance of edward S.Carling,A.K.A.,Eddie carling.

00:30.580 --> 00:31.750
This is about eddie?

00:31.840 --> 00:33.080
Ray carling's brother?

00:33.170 --> 00:38.510
This investigation will determine if anyone in the 125th precinct

00:38.570 --> 00:42.590
of the new york police department aided eddie carling in the commission of a crime,

00:42.660 --> 00:44.370
or the subsequent cover of one.

00:44.420 --> 00:49.030
As you know,aiding and abetting a suspect in a felony is a crime.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.070
Oh,that's okay.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.680
I-I only aid and abet suspects in misdemeanors.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.200
Do you know the whereabouts of eddie carling,detective tyler?

01:01.280 --> 01:02.590
That,I don't know.

01:02.660 --> 01:05.120
You were one of the last people to see him.

01:12.870 --> 01:15.600
All right,let's start with the night of august 21st.

01:15.680 --> 01:17.170
Where were you?

01:17.230 --> 01:18.730
I was in a hospital bed.

01:18.820 --> 01:23.180
Hospital records indicate that you were nursing multiple bullet wounds,

01:23.270 --> 01:26.030
and yet you left without telling anyone.

01:26.130 --> 01:27.230
Why would you do that?

01:27.310 --> 01:31.230
There were a number of cases I've worked on since coming to the 1-2-5,

01:31.310 --> 01:32.470
and i thought they might be connected.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.170
And were they?

01:34.220 --> 01:36.650
I pieced them together and I came up with an address.

01:36.710 --> 01:40.220
Out in hastings,so I followed it up.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.550
Hello?

02:19.960 --> 02:20.500
Hello?

02:20.580 --> 02:22.140
Hello,sam.

02:22.190 --> 02:23.140
You can hear me?

02:23.210 --> 02:24.880
Of course I can hear you.

02:24.930 --> 02:27.060
You're doing a good job,sam.

02:27.130 --> 02:28.680
But I need you to do something for me.

02:28.760 --> 02:29.830
Who is this?

02:29.900 --> 02:32.750
I need you to go to the basement.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.570
Why?

02:34.660 --> 02:38.990
The basement,sam-- across the room,behind you.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.480
I need you to go down to the basement,sam.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.980
You'd met eddie carling before the night of august 21st,correct?

02:48.050 --> 02:50.200
Sad to say,yeS.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.850
Eddie's a screwup.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.770
Ray deserves better.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.350
So does ray's mother.

02:55.420 --> 02:56.910
And ray's father.

02:56.990 --> 03:00.830
And on the night in question,where was detective carling?

03:01.990 --> 03:03.690
He was going door-to-door.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.450
Sometimes he moonlights as a fuller brush man.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.190
Got a hell of a way with that johnny mop.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.640
This is not a game,lieutenant.

03:11.710 --> 03:13.920
All right,all right.

03:14.020 --> 03:16.650
Ray likes to play the occasional accumulator.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.070
Accumulator?

03:18.180 --> 03:19.810
The ponies?

03:19.870 --> 03:21.040
Any word from ray?

03:21.110 --> 03:22.150
Nah.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.180
Tried him at home,tried at the snug.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.800
Nothing.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.400
What is that?

03:35.490 --> 03:36.390
I don't know.It's been there all day.

03:36.430 --> 03:37.870
Who's it for?

03:38.040 --> 03:40.050
No card on it or nothin'.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.440
Well,who brought it in?

03:45.590 --> 03:46.370
Hey,ted.

03:46.470 --> 03:47.300
Hey,ray.

03:47.350 --> 03:48.360
Hey,boss.

03:48.450 --> 03:49.950
Where you been?

03:50.950 --> 03:51.870
Honestly?

03:51.950 --> 03:52.530
No.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.500
Lie to me.

03:53.570 --> 03:55.020
I find it oddly comforting.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.330
I went up to yonkers.

03:56.350 --> 03:57.500
You went to the track.

03:57.580 --> 04:00.630
It was the commander's return to turf for the first time since june.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.700
Plus,his first start with the new barn.

04:02.770 --> 04:04.820
Well,how'd the commander fair today?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.950
He stalked the pace and wiped out.

04:07.350 --> 04:09.830
I know what you're gonna say-- when am I gonna learn,right?

04:09.930 --> 04:14.390
Nah,what I'm gonna say is,while you were out making fast bets on slow ponies,

04:14.470 --> 04:18.730
a certain waste of wild air named eddie was gettin' himself arrested once again.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.870
You gotta be kiddin' me.

04:21.700 --> 04:22.850
What'd he get pinched for?

04:22.920 --> 04:24.240
Robbery.

04:24.310 --> 04:25.840
Armed robbery.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.970
Patrol made the collar.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.680
Out of respect,they figured they'd wait until you talked to the desk sergeant

04:31.720 --> 04:33.830
before they entered the charges on the arrest report.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.460
I'll kill him.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.720
What is this thing?

05:26.310 --> 05:29.280
now go to the ya.

05:37.710 --> 05:39.960
find the big rock.

05:40.030 --> 05:41.700
Dig in.

06:39.270 --> 06:41.980
555-0195.

06:42.070 --> 06:44.470
555-0195.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.440
Sam!

06:58.300 --> 06:59.540
What happened?

06:59.630 --> 07:00.700
You left the hospital.

07:00.780 --> 07:01.500
I know,annie.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.670
I was there when I left.

07:02.780 --> 07:03.630
Why?

07:03.700 --> 07:04.980
I don't like hospitals.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.120
They smell like.

07:06.190 --> 07:07.710
hospitals.

07:09.690 --> 07:10.540
What's going on?

07:10.610 --> 07:12.290
Hello,tyler.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.370
Head over here.

07:14.910 --> 07:16.590
Oh,and sam?

07:16.670 --> 07:20.260
If you ever want to know why you're here in 1973,

07:20.360 --> 07:24.480
you can never tell anyone about this phone call.

07:26.150 --> 07:28.690
My name is sam tyler.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.110
I was in an accident,and I woke up in 1973.

07:32.190 --> 07:35.570
I don't know how or why I'm here,but whatever's happened,

07:35.640 --> 07:37.730
it's like I've landed on a different planeT.

07:37.810 --> 07:41.250
Now maybe if I can work out the reason,I can get home.

07:52.312 --> 07:55.272
Well,so would you guys up in hyde,uh.

07:55.622 --> 07:56.852
I.D.That?

07:56.912 --> 07:58.832
You can't very well.

07:58.892 --> 08:00.732
fingerprint him,right?

08:00.762 --> 08:04.772
We have some pretty advanced methods in hyde involving D.N.A.

08:04.892 --> 08:06.452
D.N.A.?

08:06.522 --> 08:08.312
What,like the stuff babies are made out of?

08:08.372 --> 08:11.342
Yeah,like what babies are made out of.

08:17.502 --> 08:19.202
So what's with ray?

08:19.282 --> 08:23.352
I mean,it's not like him to miss out on an opportunity for some gross-out humor.

08:23.442 --> 08:25.812
Who's the collar that's more important than a head in a box?

08:25.882 --> 08:27.702
That's his brother.

08:27.782 --> 08:29.072
His brother?

08:29.132 --> 08:30.082
His kid brother.

08:30.152 --> 08:31.122
Eddie.

08:32.282 --> 08:33.871
Um,why's he dressed like that?

08:33.952 --> 08:35.812
Is he a magician?

08:36.621 --> 08:37.282
No.

08:37.402 --> 08:39.902
Eddie is a doorman at the monarch.

08:41.352 --> 08:44.632
Eddie carling-- multiple counts of petty theft,

08:44.712 --> 08:47.942
drunk and disorderly,disturbing the peace.

08:48.032 --> 08:49.862
How did a guy like that manage to get a job

08:49.942 --> 08:53.712
as a doorman one of the best addresses on the upper east side?

08:53.792 --> 08:55.832
You got a brother?

08:55.902 --> 08:57.872
So you got him the job?

08:57.932 --> 08:59.732
Thing gets past you.

08:59.812 --> 09:04.612
On august 21st,your brother committed an armed robbery of a dry cleaner--

09:04.692 --> 09:08.522
two blocks away from his job,still wearing his doorman's uniform.

09:08.582 --> 09:11.882
The arresting officer brought him into your precinct.

09:11.942 --> 09:15.772
Now you would do anything for your brother,wouldn't you,detective?

09:15.822 --> 09:19.522
Get him a job,get him out of jail.

09:19.582 --> 09:22.092
now that's where you're wrong.

09:26.742 --> 09:28.402
This is bad.

09:28.482 --> 09:29.932
You know how bad this is?

09:30.032 --> 09:33.362
- Racer,come on
- don't "racer" me,you can of cancer!

09:33.372 --> 09:34.392
You don't understand.

09:34.472 --> 09:36.852
No,you don't understand!

09:38.122 --> 09:41.102
I'm trying to help you get your life together.

09:41.442 --> 09:42.982
I got you the job.

09:43.052 --> 09:45.452
I let you crash at my place when you can't make rent.

09:45.522 --> 09:48.762
I fix it so ma and the old man down in florida don't hear about

09:48.822 --> 09:53.782
the minor eaks and mooches you been pinched for the last few years.

09:53.852 --> 09:59.042
And this is how you repay me,with an armed robbery in your top hat and tails?

09:59.112 --> 10:02.872
Directly across the street from where ya wear the top hat and tails!

10:02.932 --> 10:04.792
Master criminal.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.272
We got the number for the store manager,

10:07.322 --> 10:11.162
in case you wanna call and see about dropping the charges against eddie.

10:11.242 --> 10:12.842
No,not this time.

10:12.912 --> 10:15.702
We're not dropping nothing this time.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.400
You on smack?

10:19.470 --> 10:20.800
What?

10:20.870 --> 10:21.910
Me?

10:21.970 --> 10:23.750
Smack?

10:23.820 --> 10:25.110
W-- come on,ray!

10:25.180 --> 10:26.240
I'm the one that dr.Silverstone d 

10:26.260 --> 10:29.950
to chase around the office just to get me to--to take a flu shot.

10:30.020 --> 10:33.940
Yeah,you always were a ladyboy when it came to that.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.550
I can't do nothin' right!

10:39.620 --> 10:41.570
You know?

10:41.900 --> 10:46.470
I-- look,I make a buck,25 a week dressed like the freakin' nutcrackeR.

10:46.550 --> 10:49.630
You know,changing litter boxes for rich old ladies' kitty cats.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.880
You know,"thank you,ma'am," "yes,ma'am," "my pleasure,ma'am,"

10:51.970 --> 10:54.970
all the while,my older brother's carrying my water for me.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.110
Now how do you think that makes me feel?

10:57.190 --> 11:01.370
How you should feel-- humiliated.

11:09.428 --> 11:10.928
Come in.

11:13.568 --> 11:16.668
The,uh,head in the box case?

11:16.758 --> 11:18.608
I'd like in on this one,boss.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.888
You just got shot.

11:19.968 --> 11:21.578
Grazed.I got grazed.

11:22.068 --> 11:25.458
I really want to be part of this investigation.

11:26.528 --> 11:33.108
Fine,as long as you let no-nuts work her medical magic on that raze.

11:43.278 --> 11:44.348
So.

11:44.428 --> 11:46.028
where were you?

11:46.598 --> 11:48.348
I was out.

11:49.908 --> 11:51.838
That's it?

11:52.738 --> 11:54.588
You were "out"?

11:55.598 --> 11:56.788
Yeah.

11:56.868 --> 11:58.458
I was on a date.

11:59.178 --> 12:00.748
On a date.

12:02.008 --> 12:03.828
With a sucking side wound?

12:03.898 --> 12:06.438
Well,that's not a nice way to describe her.

12:06.498 --> 12:09.138
she was more like an oozing head trauma.

12:11.038 --> 12:12.918
SaM.

12:13.368 --> 12:15.028
you saved my life.

12:15.088 --> 12:16.978
Remember?

12:17.058 --> 12:23.608
You know,I promised myself that I would try and be a better friend to you--

12:23.698 --> 12:28.048
someone who listens when you tell me all these strange things,

12:28.128 --> 12:32.998
how there are people taking you off your life support machines,

12:33.098 --> 12:36.748
and about how you and your mother are somehow the same age,

12:36.818 --> 12:43.208
and how paul newman is gonna one day make spaghetti sauces and salad dressings and lemonade.

12:43.288 --> 12:46.958
And do great things for mankind.

12:49.285 --> 12:51.445
So here I am.

12:52.395 --> 12:55.055
I'm ready to be open to all of it.

12:58.865 --> 13:01.495
And quite suddenly,you've.

13:01.855 --> 13:03.915
become secretive?

13:04.955 --> 13:05.815
I.

13:05.925 --> 13:11.115
two days ago,we were pursuing a man you said was your father.

13:11.745 --> 13:14.135
A nada?

13:14.145 --> 13:14.995
Annie-- 

13:15.055 --> 13:22.405
sam,you told me you were having visions of a woman being chased through the woods in a red dress.

13:22.485 --> 13:26.845
And then it happened...to me.

13:30.055 --> 13:31.275
So.

13:31.345 --> 13:33.285
what?

13:33.665 --> 13:37.185
You're starting to believe my crazy rants?

13:38.825 --> 13:41.115
Well,I don't know.

13:41.725 --> 13:44.445
I just.

13:45.035 --> 13:48.075
but all that happened out there.

13:48.365 --> 13:50.385
I just.

14:03.973 --> 14:05.933
I-I got work to do.

14:06.093 --> 14:07.313
You know?

14:09.213 --> 14:10.203
Yes.

14:10.263 --> 14:11.743
Okay.

14:15.843 --> 14:18.123
Thanks for the bandage.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.183
I worked the case till my tour ended,and then I.

14:23.243 --> 14:24.773
I went home.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.063
So the rest of the night was,uh,uneventful?

14:27.143 --> 14:28.303
Yeah.

14:28.373 --> 14:30.003
Yeah,uneventful.

14:33.053 --> 14:34.993
What about the phone number?

14:36.983 --> 14:38.243
The phone number?

14:38.313 --> 14:39.273
The phone number.

14:39.343 --> 14:40.413
Whose was it?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.303
Excuse me?

14:41.413 --> 14:43.203
The phone number on the bodY.

14:43.293 --> 14:45.233
Who answered the phone?

14:45.313 --> 14:49.953
When you dialed the number,who picked up,detective tyler?

14:50.033 --> 14:51.873
You know who it was.

14:51.963 --> 15:00.693
Good morning,boys and girls,and welcome to "the cowboy dan wild west jamboree," broadcasting.

15:00.743 --> 15:03.013
0-1-9-5.

15:08.243 --> 15:10.663
a basket of kumquats.

15:22.693 --> 15:23.833
Hello?

15:25.133 --> 15:26.743
Hello?

15:27.253 --> 15:30.083
Tell me who this is,joker.

15:31.563 --> 15:36.493
Tell me who this is,or I'll climb through the phone and piss on your brain.

15:44.666 --> 15:46.096
Ray.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.446
How you doing?

15:47.496 --> 15:49.406
I've been better.

15:49.486 --> 15:51.666
How you feelin',spaceman?

15:51.746 --> 15:54.746
For a guy who just got shot,you been running around like a chipmunk.

15:54.816 --> 15:56.126
I was only grazed.

15:56.196 --> 15:57.526
You know those things'll kill ya.

15:57.536 --> 15:59.766
Oh,they won't have a chance.

15:59.856 --> 16:03.296
The whiskey and the salami will beat 'em to it.

16:03.356 --> 16:06.006
So what's going on with your brother?

16:06.096 --> 16:07.766
Don't you worry about it.

16:07.826 --> 16:08.776
Anything I can do to help?

16:08.846 --> 16:10.546
Yeah,you can "don't you worry about it."

16:10.616 --> 16:11.986
So we got an I.D.On the head.

16:12.006 --> 16:13.236
His name's albert corsey.

16:13.336 --> 16:15.166
45 years old,unmarried.

16:15.226 --> 16:18.356
Hangs out with one of those biker gangs,call themselves the vicious cycles.

16:18.426 --> 16:19.376
We're going to talk to them.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.126
You guys coming?

16:20.206 --> 16:21.146
Come on.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.766
To meet the friends of the head?

16:22.846 --> 16:24.466
How could we resist?

16:51.956 --> 16:53.136
You okay,boss?

16:53.216 --> 16:58.786
Yeah,sizeable ted and me was having a conversation with these genemen about albert corsey.

16:58.876 --> 17:01.286
I told you,he's not one of us.

17:01.316 --> 17:04.165
I know you know something about albert corsey.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.463
And you know.

17:06.522 --> 17:08.203
I know.

17:08.272 --> 17:10.153
So how about we play a different game?

17:10.203 --> 17:11.403
If I win,you talk.

17:11.473 --> 17:12.673
If you win,we walk.

17:12.742 --> 17:18.363
At least until I go down and see my friend judge berger and we get a warrant to toss this place.

17:22.393 --> 17:23.573
Trust me.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.383
It'll be fun.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.983
Black nepalese it's called international cover-up.

17:29.063 --> 17:31.633
Six drinks in all-- three pints of beer,three shots of whiskey.

17:31.713 --> 17:33.393
Whoever finishes first wins.

17:33.473 --> 17:34.853
Simple.

17:34.943 --> 17:38.893
And because toy I feel magnanimous,I'm gonna let you take the shots.

17:38.983 --> 17:40.613
They're dainty.

17:40.713 --> 17:42.713
like you.

17:43.323 --> 17:46.353
I gotta drink three shots before you finish three beers?

17:47.553 --> 17:48.663
You joking?

17:48.743 --> 17:51.033
I never joke about booze.

17:52.353 --> 17:53.303
Let's get it on.

17:53.403 --> 17:54.253
Wait!

17:54.343 --> 17:55.743
There's only one rule.

17:55.843 --> 17:57.833
You cannot touch the other guy's glass.

17:57.923 --> 17:58.743
Not at all.

17:58.823 --> 17:59.893
Agreed?

17:59.973 --> 18:02.243
If you say so,oink.

18:04.273 --> 18:06.983
I got so much to drink.

18:07.063 --> 18:09.253
What do you say you give me a little handicap?

18:09.333 --> 18:10.443
A little head start?

18:10.533 --> 18:12.173
I don't know about that,man.

18:12.243 --> 18:13.253
Oh,let him start.

18:13.353 --> 18:14.203
He's cute.

18:14.313 --> 18:15.853
Thank you,gorgeous.

18:20.663 --> 18:24.173
I learned to play this game back in world war ii.

18:24.873 --> 18:27.823
I learned that victory is achieved not with brute strength,

18:27.933 --> 18:30.043
but by outsmarting your opponent.

18:32.393 --> 18:33.743
Back then,we valued smarts.

18:33.823 --> 18:37.183
Since J.F.K.,This whole country has turned to personality.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.663
Okay,you can start.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.073
Go!

18:45.313 --> 18:47.143
Come on!

18:49.354 --> 18:50.484
We agreed.

18:50.574 --> 18:52.164
You can't touch my glass.

18:52.244 --> 18:56.924
Hence the name of the game-- international cover-up.

18:58.144 --> 18:59.784
You dirty bastard.

19:00.734 --> 19:02.474
See what I did here?

19:02.554 --> 19:04.884
Chris,who's the most clever mammal in the zoo?

19:04.974 --> 19:05.864
You are,loot.

19:05.954 --> 19:10.144
Now why don't you tell me about your friend albert corsey?

19:10.204 --> 19:11.534
Okay.

19:11.604 --> 19:14.044
You wanna know about corsey?

19:14.654 --> 19:15.784
He's a knucklehead.

19:15.874 --> 19:17.224
That's what.

19:17.294 --> 19:20.624
Comes around here a couple weeks ago,trying to find some partners for a job.

19:20.694 --> 19:23.134
Only he's a knucklehead,so everyone says "no."

19:23.204 --> 19:29.104
One guy says "yes"--this,um,part-time patch-holder named big boy louie bosco--

19:29.204 --> 19:31.164
'cause he's a knucklehead,too.

19:31.244 --> 19:33.184
Big boy bosco.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.254
Thank you.

19:35.614 --> 19:38.054
Next summer,you should come to one of my barbecues.

19:38.134 --> 19:41.044
And I'll beat your sorry ass at croquet.

19:42.394 --> 19:48.894
Lieutenant hunt,you have some pretty unorthodox investigative methods.

19:48.924 --> 19:50.934
What can I say?

19:51.004 --> 19:52.754
I'm an artist.

19:52.834 --> 19:54.334
But get resultS.

19:54.424 --> 19:55.044
Bosco!

19:55.134 --> 19:56.764
Police!

19:57.824 --> 20:00.814
We found the guy we were looking for,didn't we?

20:06.954 --> 20:09.154
Well,most of him anyway.

20:11.896 --> 20:17.606
Well,I'm guessing,uh,albert corsey and big boy bosco here made the wrong guy mad.

20:17.686 --> 20:22.146
I'll issue an alarm to all the other precincts to have us notified if any other.

20:22.226 --> 20:25.556
headless bodies are discovered.

20:28.106 --> 20:30.466
Do you know this guy?

20:31.756 --> 20:34.946
Well,the clothes look familiar,but I can't place the face.

20:51.706 --> 20:53.446
What are you reading?

20:58.266 --> 21:03.896
"the sick sense: Schizorenia,E.S.P. & The conscious nd."

21:03.966 --> 21:05.026
Sounds deep.

21:05.096 --> 21:07.806
Why you reading about E.S.P.,Annie?

21:09.526 --> 21:14.076
Because I can't stop thinking about it-- the red dress.

21:14.956 --> 21:16.796
Stop!

21:18.156 --> 21:19.196
You hurt?

21:19.296 --> 21:20.096
I'm fine.

21:20.424 --> 21:21.934
And you predicted it.

21:22.354 --> 21:26.684
I mean,scientists are just beginning to understand the components of extrasensory perception.

21:26.764 --> 21:30.984
Okay,but where--where does the schizophrenia part come in?

21:31.924 --> 21:33.014
Well.

21:33.114 --> 21:34.854
I'm worried about you,saM.

21:34.934 --> 21:36.784
about your mental health.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.544
You and me both.

21:39.634 --> 21:42.944
Why,just the other day,I received a phone call from the great beyond.

21:43.024 --> 21:44.944
Or maybe it was 2008.

21:45.014 --> 21:51.744
Or maybe it was god frohigh in the heavens,having a little laugh at sam tyler and the whole.

21:53.024 --> 21:55.684
existential shell game.

21:55.764 --> 21:58.704
Well,I wanna talk to you about all this.

21:58.784 --> 22:01.484
I wanna talk to you.

22:03.874 --> 22:05.334
about ray.

22:07.251 --> 22:08.831
What about him?

22:09.271 --> 22:10.691
Does he seem a little.

22:10.791 --> 22:13.121
angrier than usual to you?

22:13.231 --> 22:14.391
Everyone is upset.

22:14.461 --> 22:16.751
You know,someone is cutting off heads in the precinct.

22:16.831 --> 22:20.251
Ray is probably more upset on account of his brother eddie being arrested.

22:20.331 --> 22:21.281
It's a shame.

22:21.351 --> 22:23.811
You know,there's a lot things I don't like about ray carling,

22:23.891 --> 22:27.371
but he has always been a good brother to eddie.

22:27.461 --> 22:30.431
I mean,ray's even letting eddie live with him.

22:32.541 --> 22:35.451
H-how long has eddie been staying with ray?

22:35.571 --> 22:37.381
Well,maybe a month,maybe more.

22:37.461 --> 22:38.831
I'm not sure.

22:38.911 --> 22:40.581
Why?

22:40.911 --> 22:42.171
That explains a lot.

22:42.261 --> 22:44.741
Sam,what's going on?

22:45.443 --> 22:47.993
I'm not completelyure yet.

22:48.563 --> 22:50.253
but thanks,annie.

22:50.353 --> 22:51.983
See you later.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.263
Do you speak any english?

22:56.143 --> 22:57.683
What's going on?

22:57.783 --> 23:02.603
Well,I've been talking tothis nice lady for ten minutes,and I have no idea what she's saying.

23:03.193 --> 23:06.003
*********

23:06.113 --> 23:07.293
*******

23:07.393 --> 23:10.783

23:10.863 --> 23:11.953

23:12.013 --> 23:13.203
*****

23:13.293 --> 23:15.443
*******

23:15.553 --> 23:17.443
She--she's here about big boy bosco.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.323
*********

23:20.443 --> 23:22.513
****

23:22.593 --> 23:25.853
******

23:25.933 --> 23:27.273
***

23:27.353 --> 23:29.753
She saw a man come out of bosco's apartment.

23:29.833 --> 23:32.253
His hands and face were on fire.

23:32.253 --> 23:36.803
******

23:37.123 --> 23:40.533
Did she just say that big boy bosco was killed by the devil?

23:40.603 --> 23:41.953
Yeah,I think so.

23:42.023 --> 23:44.203
Just got a call about a headless body in hastings.

23:44.293 --> 23:45.273
35 stewart.

23:45.343 --> 23:46.483
Let's go.

23:50.793 --> 23:52.353
You coming?

23:52.423 --> 23:53.703
Yeah.

23:55.187 --> 23:57.487
Hey,fraini,can you find someone who speaks spanish.

23:57.547 --> 23:58.517
To take this woman's statement?

23:58.527 --> 23:59.147
Gracias.

23:59.247 --> 24:00.917
Yeah.Sure.

24:04.987 --> 24:07.917
Well,based pure on stench assessment.

24:08.007 --> 24:10.307
corsey's been dead at least three days.

24:10.377 --> 24:14.907
But the body was dug up recently-- I'd say in the last 24 hours or so.

24:15.887 --> 24:17.927
Let's check the house,chris.

24:20.347 --> 24:21.147
I'll call the loot.

24:21.217 --> 24:22.237
Yeah.

24:22.317 --> 24:25.517
You don't think maybe it really was the devil?

24:25.587 --> 24:26.697
There's no such thing,chris.

24:26.777 --> 24:28.727
There's only bad people.

24:42.587 --> 24:45.197
What did you just take off the body?

24:45.257 --> 24:46.417
What are you talking about?

24:46.467 --> 24:49.597
I saw you take something off the body,ray.

24:50.537 --> 24:52.007
You wanna search me,spaceman?

24:52.087 --> 24:53.597
Is that what you wanna do?

24:53.687 --> 24:58.717
This mope's head might be gone,but at least it ain't up his ass like yours is.

25:02.507 --> 25:03.507
It's about your brother,isn't it?

25:03.577 --> 25:07.407
No,this is about you keeping your chopsticks out of other people's rice.

25:07.487 --> 25:09.937
That's what this is about.

25:19.669 --> 25:25.339
A short while after your detectives returned from 35 stewart,eddie carling posted bail.

25:25.419 --> 25:29.849
We weren't able to locate any paperwork indicating who the surety was.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.469
So many pieces of paper these days.

25:33.559 --> 25:34.849
I lose a piece of paper.

25:34.939 --> 25:37.869
I file another piece of paper to find the missing piece of paper.

25:37.879 --> 25:42.869
So you don't know who bailed eddie carling out of your jail?

25:42.949 --> 25:45.299
Not a clue.

25:45.359 --> 25:48.439
When I got back to the station,eddie was already gone.

25:48.509 --> 25:50.589
Who bailed him out?

25:51.649 --> 25:52.999
Now that's an interesting story.

25:53.069 --> 25:54.059
Hey,ddie's not in holding.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.069
Where is he?

25:55.079 --> 25:56.559
Hold on.

25:56.579 --> 25:58.569
Uh,he made bail,like,an hour ago.

25:58.639 --> 25:59.599
He what?

25:59.669 --> 26:00.789
Well,who posted it?

26:00.879 --> 26:01.419
I don't know.

26:01.509 --> 26:02.939
I-I didn't see the surety's name.

26:03.049 --> 26:04.119
But sam had the papers.

26:04.209 --> 26:05.589
Oh,sam had the papers,did he?

26:05.669 --> 26:06.489
Yeah.And you know what?

26:06.499 --> 26:08.059
It was kind of weird.

26:08.109 --> 26:10.649
Eddie acted like he didn't want to leave.

26:11.499 --> 26:12.349
Carling.

26:12.409 --> 26:13.659
Ray,it's sam.

26:13.729 --> 26:15.599
Yeah,I don't have time to talk to you.

26:15.669 --> 26:17.309
It's about eddie.

26:20.059 --> 26:21.789
I'm listening.

26:22.459 --> 26:24.799
I bailed eddie carling out.

26:29.644 --> 26:31.584
You bail out my brother?

26:31.644 --> 26:33.954
You got some stones on you,tyler.

26:34.024 --> 26:37.264
Well,you know,I figured whatever you got mixed up in had to do with your brother.

26:37.334 --> 26:40.894
So I sprung him myself to see where he'd go.

26:40.984 --> 26:43.614
He made a beeline for this.

26:44.104 --> 26:47.194
Just a bunch of jewelry,silver,some cash.

26:47.244 --> 26:48.604
Nothing epic.

26:48.664 --> 26:51.944
Nothing worth decapitating people over.

26:52.504 --> 26:55.534
So what are you guys mixed up in,ray?

26:56.034 --> 26:58.654
Where'd you get the stuff from,eddie?

27:00.454 --> 27:01.524
Fine.

27:01.604 --> 27:02.654
I'll take you down to the station.

27:02.724 --> 27:03.984
We can have our conversation there.

27:04.084 --> 27:05.214
Get your hands off him,tyler.

27:05.284 --> 27:06.664
Two people are dead,ray.

27:06.754 --> 27:09.464
The killer's still out there,and you're withholding vital information.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.244
You have any idea what hunt's gonna say when he finds out about this?

27:11.324 --> 27:13.814
Hunt don't understand!

27:20.060 --> 27:22.180
One last time.

27:23.290 --> 27:27.010
Where'd you get the stuff from,eddie?

27:33.470 --> 27:34.610
Okay.

27:35.280 --> 27:40.590
It's what me,corsey and big boy bosco stole from this guy who lives at the monarch.

27:40.670 --> 27:41.870
The monarch?

27:41.950 --> 27:44.050
Okay,that's the building where you work?

27:44.120 --> 27:45.850
Yeah.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.120
Now who's the guy?

27:49.820 --> 27:52.030
Donovan stamp.

27:52.490 --> 27:54.070
Who's donovan stamp?

27:54.140 --> 27:55.410
You don't know who donovan stamp is?

27:55.500 --> 27:56.880
He ain't from around here,eddie.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.000
He's the.

27:58.090 --> 27:59.520
"the werewolf wall street."

27:59.610 --> 28:00.880
I don't know.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.640
"The werewolf of wall street"?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.430
He's a big-time philanthropist.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.410
They got parks named after him.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.750
I mean,even now with the stock market melting around him,

28:08.820 --> 28:10.520
this guy somehow still gets richer.

28:10.590 --> 28:11.760
Okay.

28:11.840 --> 28:16.410
So you pull this clown stickup,looking to get busted,

28:16.480 --> 28:19.160
'cause you figured jail would be the only place you'd be safe.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.080
Right?

28:22.050 --> 28:25.510
Or maybe you figured jail would be the only place he'd be safe?

28:25.600 --> 28:26.540
Hey,hey,no.

28:26.620 --> 28:27.820
Racer was just looking out for me.

28:27.910 --> 28:29.560
We don't owe him no explanation,eddie.

28:29.650 --> 28:31.510
But you knew,ray,this whole time!

28:31.590 --> 28:32.200
You knew!

28:32.300 --> 28:33.120
Yes,I knew!

28:33.250 --> 28:36.340
Sometimes you gotta keep a secret when the reason's right.

28:44.735 --> 28:48.925
So why haven't you questioned this donovan stamp guy?

28:49.005 --> 28:49.755
Three reasons.

28:49.835 --> 28:52.985
Number one-- the minute I do,I implicate my brother in the theft.

28:53.085 --> 28:55.775
Number two--stamp is a businessman.

28:55.875 --> 29:00.185
He ain't the type to decapitate a couple of mooks overome stolen silverware.

29:00.255 --> 29:03.705
And number three--he's the werewolf of wall street.

29:03.805 --> 29:05.505
That makes him one of the untouchables.

29:05.615 --> 29:08.305
This--the guy eats sunday cake with congressmen.

29:08.385 --> 29:11.335
He plays in mayor lindsay's foursome up at westchester.

29:11.445 --> 29:14.065
You don't just walk in and accuse a guy like that of murder.

29:14.165 --> 29:15.715
You just don'T.

29:17.675 --> 29:19.215
Or.

29:19.305 --> 29:20.615
you do.

29:20.705 --> 29:23.655
You and detective tyler took eddie back to the monarch

29:23.725 --> 29:26.875
so he could return what he stole from donovan stamp.

29:26.945 --> 29:28.415
Yes,we did.

29:28.475 --> 29:31.805
And this was the last time you saw your brother?

29:31.885 --> 29:34.785
Yeah,that was the last time.

29:45.765 --> 29:49.635
Mr.Stamp,I want to apologize on behalf of my brother.

29:49.725 --> 29:54.225
And as a police officer,I give you my word you will never see him again.

29:54.295 --> 29:59.635
Strange thing about being robbed-- it forces you to realize what is truly valuable.

29:59.715 --> 30:04.645
Yeah,I guess I,uh,I kinda took that by mistake.

30:06.741 --> 30:09.031
I was like you,you know.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.851
Not a nickel in my pocket.

30:10.951 --> 30:18.891
So I learned all of the petty grifts and short cons that one needed in world war ii new york city.

30:20.061 --> 30:24.251
Had the morals of,uh,your basic sewer rat.

30:24.331 --> 30:29.121
I would gladly lift the insulin from my own diabetic mother's dop kit

30:29.221 --> 30:35.991
and sell it on the street,leaving behind a chocolate chip cookie in its place.

30:39.181 --> 30:42.851
But we can't ignore the fact that the two murders are linked to the robbery iur home.

30:42.951 --> 30:45.891
Those two men were thieves.

30:45.971 --> 30:48.771
They took things.

30:48.861 --> 30:51.901
I mean,I-I don't even know what that is.

30:51.961 --> 30:54.061
You took their lives.

30:55.791 --> 30:57.801
I took their lives?

30:57.881 --> 31:00.171
What are you accusing me of,detective?

31:00.261 --> 31:02.581
I thought I was the victim of a crime.

31:02.641 --> 31:04.981
Are you suggesting otherwise?

31:05.061 --> 31:08.621
We're gonna have to ask you toome with us,mr.Stamp.

31:09.531 --> 31:14.331
Do you believe donovan stamp had something to do with eddie's disappearance?

31:14.401 --> 31:20.061
You don't get to be the werewolf of wall street without a little bloodlust.

31:20.141 --> 31:20.991
Corsey.

31:21.071 --> 31:23.991
Big boy that left.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.251
eddie.

31:26.331 --> 31:28.151
We talked with mr.Stamp.

31:28.611 --> 31:32.911
He did not speak fondly of his time at your precinct.

31:33.301 --> 31:36.281
This whole thing is utterly ridiculous.

31:36.381 --> 31:38.651
You want ridiculous?

31:38.761 --> 31:40.881
Look familiar?

31:46.621 --> 31:48.191
Of course not.

31:48.471 --> 31:49.601
You bringing a charge?

31:49.671 --> 31:52.421
Because if you're not bringing a charge,my client and I are walking out of here.

31:52.481 --> 31:56.631
Quite a coincidence,though,that twof the three people who robbed you turn up dead.

31:56.711 --> 32:01.291
Or it's what kids today call,uh,karmic retribution.

32:01.772 --> 32:06.932
You know,I've always wanted to belt a wall street-type in the face.

32:06.992 --> 32:09.732
Never have,though,which is surprising.

32:09.782 --> 32:12.492
Lieutenant,you will do no such thing.

32:12.572 --> 32:14.972
I have belted plenty of lawyers.

32:15.052 --> 32:17.152
It's like eating potato chips.

32:17.222 --> 32:20.582
Once you start,tough to stop.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.322
Someone like you,mr.Stamp,

32:25.432 --> 32:29.172
I'm gssing,probably wouldn't want to get his hands dirty.

32:30.352 --> 32:36.732
What you're saying is that I would hire someone to eliminate those who have wronged me.

32:36.812 --> 32:39.772
Sadly,you miss the point,detective tyler.

32:39.842 --> 32:45.142
By choosing the path that they did,those men guaranteed eir fate.

32:45.222 --> 32:49.112
It was their doing,not mine.

32:55.392 --> 32:58.382
I need to speak with a detectivE.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.714
I'm a detective.

33:10.104 --> 33:11.904
Put the bag down.

33:12.944 --> 33:15.014
Now step back.

33:17.274 --> 33:18.974
Don't move.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.454
I said don't move!

33:20.534 --> 33:21.964
I said--put it down.

33:22.024 --> 33:23.334
On the box.

33:23.424 --> 33:25.444
Now get down on your knees!

33:25.754 --> 33:27.524
Get down!

33:29.944 --> 33:31.984
Keep your hands up.

33:35.024 --> 33:41.854
I killed those men-- albert corsey,louis bosco.

33:41.924 --> 33:46.574
with that machete,in those clothes.

33:47.054 --> 33:51.524
A tall man with burn scars his face and hands walks into the precinct

33:51.614 --> 33:56.374
with a machete and a head in a box and confesses to the murders.

33:56.454 --> 33:57.534
That's what happened.

33:57.594 --> 33:59.054
You can't make this stuff up.

33:59.124 --> 34:01.284
Just another day at the zoo.

34:01.384 --> 34:03.854
On the ground,a-face!

34:04.164 --> 34:08.393
All the proof you need is in the box.

34:14.494 --> 34:17.833
Let me guess-- big boy bosco.

34:17.934 --> 34:20.974
The northern part of him,anyway.

34:22.159 --> 34:25.449
You wouldn't by any chance know a donovan stamp,would you?

34:25.518 --> 34:26.659
I do not.

34:26.728 --> 34:27.859
Figured.

34:27.949 --> 34:28.849
Although it's odd.

34:28.929 --> 34:29.839
He's famous.

34:29.938 --> 34:31.559
The werewolf of wall street.

34:31.659 --> 34:35.739
I hate wall street and all who crawl there.

34:37.079 --> 34:39.589
You want to tell us why you killed those two men?

34:39.649 --> 34:44.069
I was in a diner eating soup.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.449
They insulted my scars.

34:46.539 --> 34:47.929
I don't believe you.

34:48.018 --> 34:53.629
I offer a full confession,the head,and you don't believe me?

34:54.629 --> 34:57.189
I can't believe my ears,detective.

34:57.269 --> 35:02.199
Yeah,well,I can't lieve your ears either,pal.

35:06.655 --> 35:08.855
El diablo.

35:21.445 --> 35:22.425
Well,you're free to go.

35:22.555 --> 35:23.335
for now.

35:23.405 --> 35:24.765
"For now"?

35:25.055 --> 35:26.735
You hear that,willis?

35:26.815 --> 35:30.395
The boy detective is going to maintain a grudge.

35:30.475 --> 35:33.245
Stand in line,friend.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.635
Get him outta here,ted.

35:51.962 --> 35:57.442
I am going home to sleep for 14 hours saigh 

35:57.532 --> 36:01.592
I don't think I'll ever sleep again after seeing that man and his box.

36:01.602 --> 36:03.582
I know.

36:05.202 --> 36:06.812
Good night,annie.

36:06.862 --> 36:08.632
See you tomorrow.

36:12.842 --> 36:13.932
we'll talk.

36:13.992 --> 36:15.512
soon.

36:15.572 --> 36:17.362
Okay?

36:17.412 --> 36:19.282
I'd like that.

36:19.342 --> 36:21.012
Okay.

36:22.052 --> 36:25.472
The chief of d's came down hard on hunt to close the case.

36:25.542 --> 36:28.412
We tried to connect stamp to the guy with the scars,

36:28.482 --> 36:32.852
but we came up empty,and by then stamp was buried six lawyers deep.

36:32.912 --> 36:34.432
We couldn't touch him.

36:34.512 --> 36:37.382
At this point,where was eddie carling?

36:37.432 --> 36:38.342
I don't know.

36:38.412 --> 36:40.482
Last time I saw him was at stamp's apartment.

36:40.562 --> 36:48.212
So neither you nor any of your fellow detectives colluded to assist eddie carling escape prosecution?

36:48.282 --> 36:49.812
Of course not.

36:49.882 --> 36:53.292
And I'm the one who posted his bond,remember?

36:53.821 --> 36:56.331
I mean,I-I'm still on the hook for the dough.

36:56.401 --> 36:58.031
Listen,don't you worry about it.

36:58.101 --> 36:59.691
I'm gonna find my brother.

36:59.761 --> 37:01.061
Well,we hope you do.

37:01.141 --> 37:02.441
He has a lot to answer for.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.051
You guys are the least of his problems.

37:05.401 --> 37:07.481
Hear you this-- when he comes up for air,

37:07.561 --> 37:12.651
and he will--he's gonna run to you just to get away from me.

37:14.051 --> 37:17.271
So i'll call yous as soon as I get settled.

37:19.761 --> 37:21.351
Hey,look,thanks for everything you done for me.

37:21.421 --> 37:22.311
I didn't do nothing.

37:22.361 --> 37:24.491
The werewolf didn't press charges.

37:24.531 --> 37:27.061
That's how you caught your break this time.

37:30.011 --> 37:31.651
Take it.

37:36.691 --> 37:38.321
Wild blue?

37:38.441 --> 37:39.041
I.

37:39.121 --> 37:40.071
I can't take wild blue.

37:40.161 --> 37:41.851
Sure you can.

37:42.171 --> 37:43.591
Wild blue's what made you racer.

37:43.691 --> 37:45.631
I don't want to be racer anymore.

37:45.711 --> 37:46.531
What do you mean?

37:46.621 --> 37:47.891
I'm done,eddie.

37:47.971 --> 37:49.101
I got nothing else to give.

37:49.161 --> 37:53.771
You took everything from me,from the whole family,all these years.

37:53.861 --> 37:55.501
And then I almost let you take my badge.

37:55.571 --> 37:58.691
I mean,what's a guy like me do when he loses his badge?

37:58.781 --> 38:00.171
I know you think I'm a screwup.

38:00.281 --> 38:02.821
Hell,i think I'm a screwup.

38:04.401 --> 38:06.791
It's not easy being the brother of a cop.

38:08.161 --> 38:12.461
Try being the brother of a nitwit who's one bit short of being two-bit.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.201
That ain't no bubble bath either.

38:14.905 --> 38:17.965
I just wanted something for myself!

38:19.925 --> 38:24.095
My life would have been so different if I'd just passed that officers' exam.

38:24.175 --> 38:26.695
Mine,too.

38:26.775 --> 38:29.195
But here we are.

38:30.245 --> 38:31.715
I can't take your car,racer.

38:31.825 --> 38:37.735
You gotta go far,far away and never come back and don't ever call me again.

38:37.815 --> 38:38.485
All right?

38:38.575 --> 38:40.135
Anybody asks you,"you have a brother?"

38:40.225 --> 38:44.705
Tell 'em you had one once,but he died-- 'cause that's what I'm gonna say when they ask me.

38:44.785 --> 38:45.695
Look,don't do this,man.

38:45.785 --> 38:46.625
Get outta here.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.045
It's already done.

38:48.115 --> 38:50.525
For god sakes,ray,I'm your brother!

38:50.595 --> 38:52.115
Not anymore.

38:52.855 --> 38:54.945
Not anymore.

39:01.354 --> 39:03.044
We're done here.

39:03.234 --> 39:03.864
That's it?

39:04.524 --> 39:05.364
No cigarette afterward?

39:05.414 --> 39:07.744
No--no cuddling?

39:10.614 --> 39:14.654
We'll contact you if we have any further questions.

39:15.524 --> 39:19.404
I will be waiting by the phone.

39:36.734 --> 39:38.964
I left the tapes from today's interviews.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.844
I take it we got what we needed.

39:40.934 --> 39:42.844
We did.

40:08.771 --> 40:10.471
What took you so long?

40:10.561 --> 40:12.501
They try to recruit you or somethin'?

40:12.591 --> 40:15.231
Ray and I were on our way to sink a drink at the snug.

40:15.321 --> 40:16.511
He's buying.

40:16.571 --> 40:18.931
Well,I could certainly use a drink right now.

40:20.691 --> 40:22.761
They'll grab it at the desk.

40:22.831 --> 40:24.281
I'll catch up with you guys.

40:24.361 --> 40:25.301
Fine.

40:25.381 --> 40:28.291
But if you're not there by the time I finish my first mug,

40:28.371 --> 40:31.851
you're paying your own way,spaceman.

40:58.181 --> 40:59.431
Hello?

40:59.521 --> 41:01.161
Sam?

41:02.894 --> 41:04.974
Who is this?

41:05.064 --> 41:07.744
You're doing an excellent job,sam.

41:07.814 --> 41:09.574
Tell me who you are.

41:09.644 --> 41:11.654
Don't worry,sam.

41:11.734 --> 41:14.394
It's all going according to plan.
