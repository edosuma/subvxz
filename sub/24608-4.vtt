00:05.999 --> 00:07.730
Previously on Genius...

00:07.731 --> 00:11.147
I am Max Jacob.
Most days, I am a poet.

00:11.148 --> 00:13.526
That's even worse
than being a painter.

00:13.550 --> 00:16.869
I cannot bear the thought of
living in this world without you.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.931
Max, I love you.

00:18.955 --> 00:21.707
But not the way you want me to.

00:21.958 --> 00:24.003
They have sent the rest
of his family to the camps.

00:24.027 --> 00:27.446
You are the only one who
can persuade him to get out.

00:27.497 --> 00:29.709
We could take away
everything, and everyone.

00:29.733 --> 00:32.918
I am not a Jew anymore.
So, I am not leaving.

00:33.036 --> 00:35.621
This is my home. Here with God.

00:35.672 --> 00:38.251
You're a brilliant
photographer, Dora.

00:38.275 --> 00:41.320
There is a painter
trapped inside of you.

00:41.344 --> 00:43.356
Are you going to tell me
what you thought of my paintings?

00:43.380 --> 00:45.425
You have talent.

00:45.449 --> 00:47.047
You want to paint
something new and

00:47.071 --> 00:48.528
you think getting
this young girl into

00:48.552 --> 00:50.196
bed will help you do that.

00:50.220 --> 00:52.838
You're just jealous.

00:52.956 --> 00:54.634
Are you sure you are ready?

00:54.658 --> 00:56.536
Yes.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.605
I could
offer you work. As a model.

00:59.629 --> 01:01.374
That wasn't our agreement.

01:01.398 --> 01:03.983
If you don't like it, leave.

01:05.435 --> 01:07.847
Love can be dangerous.

01:07.871 --> 01:09.989
Fernande.

01:10.140 --> 01:12.658
If you ask me,
this will not end well.

02:20.377 --> 02:22.655
What dirty Beelzebub are you?

02:22.679 --> 02:27.093
You horny, stinking,
Lord of Flies fed on

02:27.117 --> 02:30.129
dung and garbage stew!

02:31.855 --> 02:34.133
We won't attend your revelries!

02:34.157 --> 02:36.675
You putrid, Slonikan fish!

02:37.928 --> 02:40.713
And festered eye
compose your flesh...

02:42.432 --> 02:46.352
Or is it, as
your friends report,

02:47.204 --> 02:50.989
your mother let a liquid fart.

02:55.378 --> 02:57.930
Death to illusions!

04:13.556 --> 04:16.742
You are coming
with us, Mr. Jacob.

04:25.035 --> 04:27.446
Then, set your hand free,

04:27.470 --> 04:31.056
and let your instincts

04:31.084 --> 04:35.770
carry your pencil
to its destination.

04:51.571 --> 04:53.148
Where are you going?

04:53.172 --> 04:54.583
I have plans.

04:54.607 --> 04:56.085
Well, change them.

04:56.109 --> 04:57.653
I have already
seen you three days this week.

04:57.677 --> 05:01.223
You told me we shouldn't
spend too much time together.

05:01.247 --> 05:02.825
I'm just trying to
follow your rules.

05:02.849 --> 05:06.595
Rules? I despise rules.

05:06.619 --> 05:09.565
Do as you please.

05:09.589 --> 05:12.574
I'll take Dora to lunch.
You don't mind, do you?

05:16.395 --> 05:18.947
Have a lovely time.

05:21.601 --> 05:23.451
She is a child, Pablo.

05:24.036 --> 05:26.215
You'll only spoil
her for someone else.

05:26.239 --> 05:28.584
You're more
narrow-minded than a bishop.

05:30.276 --> 05:32.346
She's totally capable of
looking out for herself.

05:32.645 --> 05:34.089
Monsieur Cocteau.

05:34.113 --> 05:35.591
I'm sorry to barge in.

05:35.615 --> 05:37.699
John!

05:38.151 --> 05:40.729
I've received a letter from Max.

05:40.753 --> 05:43.038
He's been arrested
by the Gestapo.

05:44.423 --> 05:45.901
They hauled him off to Drancy,

05:45.925 --> 05:49.210
but that's just a temporary
stop before they ship him east.

05:49.729 --> 05:52.213
Poor Max. You know,
I-I tried to warn him.

05:52.632 --> 05:56.384
I've drafted a petition to the
German embassy asking for his release.

05:56.669 --> 05:59.020
Everyone signed it...

06:08.514 --> 06:10.632
I can't.

06:11.350 --> 06:14.936
For God's sake, Pablo,
th-the man is sick as it is.

06:15.021 --> 06:18.006
He won't survive in a camp.

06:18.724 --> 06:21.176
The Nazis hate me, John.

06:22.829 --> 06:25.347
They have threatened to
throw me into a camp.

06:27.466 --> 06:30.552
They outlawed my art and
denounce me in speeches and,

06:32.572 --> 06:36.191
my signature would
do Max more harm than help.

06:36.909 --> 06:39.388
Send the letter without my name.

06:39.412 --> 06:41.796
Before it's too late.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.642
Where have you been?

06:55.761 --> 06:58.747
Chasing after
your new plaything?

06:59.498 --> 07:01.510
I've had a terrible day.

07:01.534 --> 07:04.886
I had my bicycle snatched right out
of my hands on the Rue d'Athenes.

07:09.575 --> 07:12.360
You see that man?

07:12.812 --> 07:15.897
He's been staring at
me since I sat down.

07:16.515 --> 07:19.434
I think he's following me.

07:22.154 --> 07:26.041
Did I tell you how Rene Drouin has
asked me to do a show at his gallery?

07:27.193 --> 07:29.304
He wants to change
the dates again.

07:29.328 --> 07:33.615
How am I supposed to prepare
if he can't make up his mind?

07:38.371 --> 07:40.949
Have you heard a word I've said?

07:40.973 --> 07:43.485
You are not the
only one with problems, Dora.

07:43.509 --> 07:46.294
Something terrible
has happened to Max.

07:50.082 --> 07:52.628
Max. What a surprise.

07:52.652 --> 07:54.596
I, uh, I hope you don't mind.

07:54.620 --> 07:56.865
I heard you were back
in town, and, and, uh...

07:56.889 --> 07:59.707
I, I, I'm glad to see you.

07:59.859 --> 08:02.504
What, uh, what
happened between us, uh...

08:02.528 --> 08:04.573
It was a, a hard
time for all of us.

08:04.597 --> 08:10.452
I care for you, of course,
but I am, I am not, um, yeah.

08:11.170 --> 08:14.589
Max. It's all right.

08:15.675 --> 08:18.086
I have, uh, met someone.

08:18.110 --> 08:20.188
How wonderful. Um.

08:20.212 --> 08:21.590
Yep. Yeah.

08:21.614 --> 08:23.091
Who is he?

08:23.115 --> 08:25.093
No. No, no, no. No, no.

08:25.117 --> 08:26.595
A woman. Yeah.

08:26.619 --> 08:28.096
Oh.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.033
Her name is Cecile.
She is, uh...

08:31.057 --> 08:34.642
Something, really. She's...

08:42.702 --> 08:49.269
Oh. I see that you have
your eye on someone, too.

08:49.270 --> 08:53.027
Oh. No,
she's-she's just a neighbor.

08:53.479 --> 08:56.792
Just a neighbor.
And what is her name?

08:56.816 --> 09:00.335
I don't even know.

09:01.087 --> 09:03.098
Invite me in.

09:03.122 --> 09:08.307
I want to see what, uh, you've been up
to and most importantly, I need a drink.

09:08.308 --> 09:11.473
Actually, I was
just on my way out.

09:11.497 --> 09:13.815
Why don't you come with me?

09:15.468 --> 09:16.778
700.

09:16.802 --> 09:18.313
Each?

09:18.337 --> 09:19.614
For all three.

09:19.638 --> 09:21.049
Piss off, Sagot.

09:21.073 --> 09:22.818
I wouldn't let them
go for twice that.

09:22.842 --> 09:25.587
If you don't like it,
try your luck with Soulie.

09:25.611 --> 09:27.823
But don't forget you
still owe me the money

09:27.847 --> 09:29.855
that I advanced you
for the pigment.

09:31.183 --> 09:33.401
Let's go, Max.

09:33.452 --> 09:36.771
I know a place where people
actually appreciate modern art.

09:41.460 --> 09:44.212
Henri Matisse?

09:44.764 --> 09:47.649
The drawing is rudimentary.
Worse than a child's.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.012
And the perspective is flat.

09:50.036 --> 09:52.720
Clouds are
yellow, skin is purple.

09:53.139 --> 09:57.692
Yes, it's-it's all wrong.
But it's magnificent.

09:58.844 --> 10:00.489
Makes no sense.

10:00.513 --> 10:02.824
Yet it's completely alive.

10:02.848 --> 10:05.293
You are twice as
talented an artist.

10:05.317 --> 10:07.162
No, this artist
has more than just talent.

10:07.186 --> 10:10.104
He has vision.

10:10.723 --> 10:13.635
I have never painted
anything this revolutionary.

10:13.659 --> 10:15.804
But you could.

10:15.828 --> 10:19.414
Yes. But I need to find
a new way of seeing things.

10:19.565 --> 10:22.144
Like this man has.
He understands.

10:22.168 --> 10:24.146
Understands what?

10:24.170 --> 10:26.882
That we don't need artists to
show us what people look like anymore.

10:26.906 --> 10:29.051
We have photographs for that.

10:29.075 --> 10:32.387
This Matisse is showing
us a deeper truth.

10:32.411 --> 10:34.322
The way things
are in our dreams.

10:34.346 --> 10:36.898
Not just as they appear to be.

10:38.017 --> 10:45.212
He has bent all the rules,
and I want to smash them.

10:48.661 --> 10:51.279
I have someone you should meet.

10:58.204 --> 11:02.390
Apollinaire. That can't
actually be your name.

11:02.908 --> 11:07.022
Judges and tax
assessors call me Kostrowitzky,

11:07.046 --> 11:10.869
but Apollinairus is
indeed my middle name,

11:10.893 --> 11:14.602
inscribed on my birth
records in Rome and

11:14.603 --> 11:20.908
ordained by destiny in honor of Apollo,
the deity of the Delphic Oracle.

11:22.795 --> 11:26.481
You're even more
full of yourself than I am.

11:35.741 --> 11:39.627
I think I
like your Spanish friend.

11:41.447 --> 11:44.899
Absinthe! The green muse.

11:55.661 --> 11:58.907
As artistes, we must
demand nothing less than the

11:58.931 --> 12:02.784
perpetual immoral subversion
of the existing order.

12:06.005 --> 12:07.549
Oh...

12:07.573 --> 12:13.027
Look out! Hey!
You'll get yourself killed.

12:15.247 --> 12:18.522
And if he did die, do you

12:18.546 --> 12:22.221
know what he might see
on the other side?

12:22.855 --> 12:26.007
Tell me.

12:26.325 --> 12:29.444
I will show you instead.

12:40.506 --> 12:41.883
Clowns?

12:41.907 --> 12:45.259
Not just clowns, Harlequins.

12:47.246 --> 12:50.158
What is the difference?

12:50.182 --> 12:54.602
Look closely.
There is evil behind those eyes.

12:58.157 --> 13:01.242
Everyone thinks that
Harlequins are entertainers,

13:03.295 --> 13:06.007
but that is
merely their disguise.

13:06.031 --> 13:12.834
They are actually,
devils, escaped from hell.

13:22.514 --> 13:26.296
Your picture is,
um, too symbolist.

13:26.552 --> 13:27.696
Oh, really?

13:27.720 --> 13:28.863
Mm.

13:28.887 --> 13:32.607
And what have
you written tonight?

13:34.026 --> 13:39.154
My poem is, um,
oh, oh, oh! Right here.

13:39.732 --> 13:43.511
It is just waiting for me
to pour it upon the page.

13:43.535 --> 13:47.221
It is, uh, much too cheerful.

13:48.173 --> 13:49.484
The acrobat, you mean?

13:49.508 --> 13:51.319
Yeah, he is so pretty.

13:51.343 --> 13:55.296
You might as well
be an Impressionist.

13:55.347 --> 13:58.526
Perpetual immoral subversion.

13:58.550 --> 14:00.662
It's not pretty pictures.

14:00.686 --> 14:02.651
If you want to outdo
Matisse, you must use

14:02.675 --> 14:04.696
your images the way
that I use my words.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.068
You must shatter
all the conventions.

14:07.092 --> 14:09.771
You must stun them
with perversity.

14:09.795 --> 14:14.749
He is right.
Sweet little dancing nymphs!

14:16.635 --> 14:20.382
They will not rattle any
bones at the Autumn Salon.

14:20.406 --> 14:23.551
Why didn't you
say something before?

14:23.575 --> 14:26.987
You draw so damn quickly,
I didn't realize it until just now.

14:26.988 --> 14:29.591
His trouble is, he's too sober.

14:29.615 --> 14:32.794
That's always a problem
of course, but right now, uh,

14:32.818 --> 14:34.929
my trouble is I will
miss the last train.

14:34.953 --> 14:36.685
No, you can't leave. I need more

14:36.709 --> 14:38.600
pretentious poetry and
heartless criticism.

14:38.624 --> 14:40.268
If I'm going to fix
this damn painting.

14:40.292 --> 14:41.936
I can't stay
all night, every night.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.812
I've got other, uh, commitments.

14:45.097 --> 14:47.482
What commitments?

15:00.512 --> 15:01.990
Where have you been?

15:02.014 --> 15:03.958
Drinking English ale
with the riff raff again.

15:03.982 --> 15:06.294
Please, mother. It's late.

15:06.318 --> 15:09.164
Do you expect me to support
you until you are 40 years old?

15:09.188 --> 15:10.465
What more do you want from me?

15:10.489 --> 15:12.233
I bring home a pay
check every month!

15:12.257 --> 15:15.917
Yes! And you waste
it all in bars and cabarets.

15:16.161 --> 15:19.075
And now Monsieur Maurice has complained
about your work at the bank.

15:19.076 --> 15:21.676
I don't care about Monsieur
Maurice and his godforsaken bank.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.511
I am a poet, not a peon.

15:23.535 --> 15:27.349
The only place you are a
poet is in your gin-addled brain.

15:27.373 --> 15:30.285
Do you know what I had to
do to get you that job?

15:30.309 --> 15:34.926
If you lose it, I won't think twice
about throwing you out on the street.

16:05.978 --> 16:09.597
Well, you are a sorry
little bugger, aren't you?

16:20.325 --> 16:23.611
It looks like you're not the only
one who got caught in the rain.

16:24.997 --> 16:28.243
The poor thing. Is it yours?

16:28.267 --> 16:32.320
Well... I suppose she is now.

16:32.871 --> 16:34.849
What should I call her?

16:34.873 --> 16:37.752
My aunt had a cat named Minou.

16:37.776 --> 16:43.150
Perfect.
And what should I call you?

16:44.450 --> 16:46.934
Fernande.

16:47.453 --> 16:49.931
Why don't you come
to my studio, Fernande?

16:49.955 --> 16:53.871
Give the kitten some-some
milk and you some hot tea.

16:53.959 --> 16:57.979
I can't, I'm, I'm expected.

17:01.366 --> 17:04.618
Poor Minou,
she's, very disappointed.

17:11.643 --> 17:13.887
Don't you ever clean?

17:13.912 --> 17:17.067
If I disturb the dust,
it gets on the paintings.

17:17.549 --> 17:19.560
Destroys them.

17:19.585 --> 17:22.230
Your paintings
must be very precious to you.

17:22.253 --> 17:26.272
They're everything.
Ah. Hold the kitty tight.

17:27.659 --> 17:28.870
Why?

17:28.894 --> 17:32.213
I want to show you my lodger.

17:37.769 --> 17:40.354
You are very kind to strays.

17:45.844 --> 17:47.455
You paint clowns?

17:47.479 --> 17:49.257
Harlequins.

17:49.281 --> 17:52.126
Most of the artists I
know prefer to paint naked women.

17:52.150 --> 17:55.002
I prefer not to paint
what everyone else does.

17:55.254 --> 17:57.599
I'm submitting it
to the Autumn Salon.

17:57.623 --> 17:59.901
I went last year.

17:59.925 --> 18:04.645
This looks, well, not like
any of the paintings I saw.

18:05.664 --> 18:07.442
That's exactly the point.

18:07.466 --> 18:10.718
I want to shake the judges out of
their frock coats and cravats.

18:10.836 --> 18:12.180
It's a new century.

18:12.204 --> 18:13.982
Everything is changing.

18:14.006 --> 18:16.824
Art must change, too.

18:18.544 --> 18:22.096
Most painters just want
someone to buy their pictures.

18:23.148 --> 18:26.801
That's being a
whore, not an artist.

18:27.486 --> 18:30.938
There's no
shame in making a living.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.939
I've been meaning to
talk to you for a long time,

18:37.963 --> 18:41.182
but you're
always in such a hurry.

18:43.201 --> 18:46.353
Who are they?

18:46.638 --> 18:50.291
Some people I
saw at the Lapin Agile.

18:51.376 --> 18:55.229
She looks like she
wants to get away from him.

18:59.251 --> 19:02.703
What's wrong?

19:04.189 --> 19:07.575
It's as though you've
already drawn my picture.

19:09.528 --> 19:16.858
No. I don't know if I could
ever draw someone as beautiful as you.

19:52.471 --> 19:54.082
What are you doing?

19:54.106 --> 19:55.617
Drawing.

19:55.641 --> 19:57.218
I didn't say you could do that.

19:57.242 --> 19:58.786
Sorry. I thought...

19:58.810 --> 20:00.455
People pay me to model for them.

20:00.479 --> 20:02.863
I don't do it for free.

20:03.849 --> 20:04.926
Where are you going?

20:04.950 --> 20:06.361
This was a mistake.

20:06.385 --> 20:08.229
Laurent will ask
1,000 questions.

20:08.253 --> 20:10.398
Where have I been?
Who was I with?

20:10.422 --> 20:13.007
This can never happen again.

20:23.451 --> 20:27.039
The Gestapo don't know the
first thing about poetry.

20:27.063 --> 20:30.107
I am quite certain they
have no appreciation

20:30.131 --> 20:32.645
for the talents of
your little Jew.

20:32.669 --> 20:35.654
Um, he is a Catholic, actually.

20:35.839 --> 20:38.657
I wouldn't repeat that
fiction to anyone else.

20:38.675 --> 20:40.286
No, of course, Minister.

20:40.310 --> 20:43.089
Now, that's not
his only difficulty.

20:43.113 --> 20:48.346
It's well known that he has
certain deviant predilections.

20:52.255 --> 20:59.344
He-He's revered in France
as, uh, an idol to our youth and...

20:59.429 --> 21:03.749
He invented an entirely
new language of poetry.

21:04.134 --> 21:07.920
Personally, I'm rather
partial to the symbolists.

21:08.038 --> 21:14.796
But, despite his pretentions, I agree
Jacob's words have a certain power.

21:16.012 --> 21:17.356
You've read him?

21:17.380 --> 21:20.399
We are not all
philistines, Monsieur Cocteau.

21:20.517 --> 21:25.070
Then, you understand how
much he means to-to the French.

21:25.288 --> 21:29.975
Indeed, and you do have some
rather influential friends in Vichy.

21:32.362 --> 21:35.113
I'll see what we can do.

21:40.603 --> 21:41.586
May I help you?

21:41.610 --> 21:44.705
I have release papers
for prisoner 15872.

21:46.643 --> 21:49.261
- Jacob?
- Yes.

21:50.013 --> 21:55.115
I'm sorry. Monsieur
Jacob died last night.

21:58.121 --> 22:00.873
What...

22:06.329 --> 22:09.314
The service is starting.

22:11.701 --> 22:14.003
I should have
dragged him out of that

22:14.027 --> 22:16.330
monastery and put him
on a boat to America!

22:16.873 --> 22:20.019
You are not the king, Pablo.

22:20.043 --> 22:23.989
You could not force Max to do
something he didn't want to do.

22:24.013 --> 22:26.592
He died alone.

22:26.616 --> 22:32.104
In a cold room on a dirty cot.
This damn war is almost over.

22:32.322 --> 22:36.193
If only he could have stayed
hidden for a few more months.

22:41.197 --> 22:46.585
He had a good life. He had God.

22:50.607 --> 22:53.052
Now come inside and
say goodbye to him.

22:53.076 --> 22:57.790
No, no, I-I said goodbye
to him last year in Loiret. No.

22:57.814 --> 23:00.559
If you don't pay your last
respects, you'll regret it.

23:00.583 --> 23:03.129
No, I want to remember
him alive, not dead in a coffin.

23:03.153 --> 23:06.371
I'll only see
myself lying there. No.

23:07.657 --> 23:10.469
I wouldn't worry
about dying, Pablo.

23:10.493 --> 23:13.879
I'm sure you are
immortal like a vampire.

23:15.632 --> 23:17.710
What is wrong with you?

23:17.734 --> 23:24.083
Have you been drinking?
I'm going home.

23:24.107 --> 23:25.551
Why?

23:25.575 --> 23:27.653
So you can climb into bed
with your little girlfriend?

23:27.677 --> 23:29.221
To feel young again?

23:29.245 --> 23:32.164
What a marvelous idea.

23:46.329 --> 23:49.141
Hey, toots, I was here first.
Wait your turn.

23:49.165 --> 23:50.776
How about a date, mademoiselle?

23:50.800 --> 23:52.985
I got chocolate.

23:53.703 --> 23:56.015
Who are all these people, Jaime?

23:56.039 --> 23:58.154
They put his
face on the cover of a

23:58.178 --> 24:00.186
magazine, now everyone
wants his autograph.

24:00.210 --> 24:02.121
So, why are you here?

24:02.145 --> 24:05.024
Oh, well, Pablo invited
me to the Catalan to celebrate.

24:05.048 --> 24:06.759
He's not here.

24:06.783 --> 24:10.535
He's with Dora, they're choosing
work for her gallery show.

24:12.155 --> 24:14.467
Mademoiselle, you seem like
an intelligent young woman,

24:14.491 --> 24:18.170
you must know the
kind of man he is.

24:18.194 --> 24:20.806
What do you mean?

24:20.830 --> 24:22.808
He is a genius.

24:22.832 --> 24:24.808
He thinks it gives
him the right to

24:24.832 --> 24:27.285
demand of everyone,
especially his women,

24:27.504 --> 24:30.789
to cater to his whims.

24:31.140 --> 24:34.620
He's been like
this for 50 years.

24:34.644 --> 24:38.196
Do you really think he's
going to change for you?

24:40.316 --> 24:42.361
Should I come back tomorrow?

24:42.385 --> 24:45.303
Why not stay a bit longer?

24:45.355 --> 24:46.832
We agreed on three hours.

24:46.856 --> 24:51.076
Yes, for five francs,
but, I have 10.

24:53.563 --> 24:54.974
My neck hurts.

24:54.998 --> 24:56.675
I don't think I can
pose any more today.

24:56.699 --> 25:00.385
And I can't paint anymore, so
why don't you get comfortable?

25:01.538 --> 25:05.257
I will rub your neck.

25:07.443 --> 25:10.595
Pig.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.060
So, how much did he give you?

25:15.084 --> 25:16.328
I earned it.

25:16.352 --> 25:19.404
I don't need to report
every centime to you.

25:19.422 --> 25:21.200
So you expect me
to pay for everything, huh?

25:21.224 --> 25:24.676
The food? The rent?

25:24.727 --> 25:26.939
Maybe if you made a sculpture
someone actually wanted to buy,

25:26.963 --> 25:29.575
you wouldn't have to
take all my money.

25:29.599 --> 25:30.976
You ungrateful bitch!

25:31.000 --> 25:34.013
Fernande. Are you all right?

25:34.037 --> 25:36.048
Mind your business,
Spaniard, or I'll report you to

25:36.072 --> 25:39.257
the immigration authorities.

25:39.275 --> 25:41.865
You don't have to let him
treat you this way, Fernande.

25:41.978 --> 25:45.730
Knock on my door anytime,
and I'll help you.

25:47.984 --> 25:50.629
Why is he
talking to you like that?

25:50.653 --> 25:53.705
Hmm? Who is he to you?

25:53.790 --> 25:56.735
No one. Look at his eyes.

25:56.759 --> 25:59.644
He's a lunatic. Leave us alone.

26:14.010 --> 26:15.788
"Everything enchants Picasso.

26:15.812 --> 26:17.556
The delightful and the horrible.

26:17.580 --> 26:19.592
The abject and the delicate.

26:19.616 --> 26:22.127
His new masterpiece,
'Saltimbanques' strikes like

26:22.151 --> 26:24.970
a sword in the heart of
those who cling to history."

26:25.021 --> 26:31.831
Oh, it is powerful, Guillaume, but,
uh, since when are you an art critic?

26:31.832 --> 26:35.507
Since I discovered La
Plume pays 20 francs per review.

26:35.531 --> 26:37.009
What?

26:37.033 --> 26:39.311
I submitted
it for the next issue.

26:39.335 --> 26:42.296
Why don't you let me finish
the bloody painting before you try

26:42.297 --> 26:44.689
and publish articles about it?

26:52.348 --> 26:54.866
Watch where you're going.

26:55.151 --> 26:58.069
You are the one who's in
the way, you little Dago.

27:04.794 --> 27:07.712
Come on, let's go.

27:07.997 --> 27:09.208
Let go of me!

27:09.232 --> 27:10.776
What the hell were you thinking?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.044
The man is twice your size.

27:12.068 --> 27:13.345
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

27:13.369 --> 27:14.713
The bastard deserved it.

27:14.737 --> 27:18.350
What is wrong?
I've never seen you like this.

27:18.374 --> 27:21.220
Just, exhausted, I suppose.

27:21.244 --> 27:25.829
Well, maybe you should, uh, try
sleeping instead of painting all night.

27:25.830 --> 27:28.060
How am I supposed to paint,
when I have to listen to the

27:28.084 --> 27:29.962
girl next door getting
screwed all night long?

27:29.986 --> 27:31.130
What girl?

27:31.154 --> 27:33.132
Fernande.

27:33.156 --> 27:36.793
Oh, I thought you
did not know her name.

27:37.193 --> 27:38.871
What, the one
who lives with the sculptor?

27:38.895 --> 27:41.073
I can't understand what
the hell she's doing with him!

27:41.097 --> 27:42.408
Oh, for Christ's sake.

27:42.432 --> 27:43.976
You're in love with her.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.377
Of course I'm not.

27:45.401 --> 27:46.979
You can't sleep, you can't work.

27:47.003 --> 27:48.547
You are jealous of
the man she's with.

27:48.571 --> 27:50.749
Ah, he's right.

27:50.773 --> 27:53.387
You just do not recognize
the signs because,

27:53.411 --> 27:55.941
uh, it has never
happened to you before.

27:57.947 --> 28:00.693
Well, if-if this is what
love feels like, I-I don't want it.

28:00.717 --> 28:04.302
Good. Because love
destroys and you must create.

28:04.554 --> 28:06.732
The Autumn Salon is less
than two weeks away.

28:06.756 --> 28:10.108
This is your chance to spit in the face
of the masters, to shake the world,

28:10.326 --> 28:13.845
to stun Matisse.

28:14.263 --> 28:16.375
You've worked so hard
on Saltimbanques.

28:16.399 --> 28:17.840
Are you really going
to throw it away over

28:17.864 --> 28:19.178
some fantasy about
another man's lover?

28:19.202 --> 28:20.412
She does not love him.

28:20.436 --> 28:22.681
For Christ's sake!

28:22.705 --> 28:25.584
Would you forget this tart?

28:25.608 --> 28:29.694
Just go home and
finish your painting.

29:04.925 --> 29:06.937
I need to talk to you.

29:06.961 --> 29:08.672
Did you follow me down here?

29:08.696 --> 29:11.108
I just wanted a
moment alone with you.

29:11.132 --> 29:12.809
What happened
was a mistake, Pablo.

29:12.833 --> 29:14.344
I told you not to
bother me anymore.

29:14.368 --> 29:16.680
It wasn't a mistake.
It was beautiful.

29:16.704 --> 29:19.355
I know you felt the same.

29:19.406 --> 29:21.384
I love you, Fernande.

29:21.408 --> 29:23.620
I loved you the very
first moment I saw you.

29:23.644 --> 29:25.555
You're making
a fool of yourself.

29:25.579 --> 29:27.491
Well, maybe I am.

29:27.515 --> 29:30.127
But that pig you're living with has no
right to treat you the way he does.

29:30.151 --> 29:32.062
What do you want from me?

29:32.086 --> 29:33.864
Move into my studio.

29:33.888 --> 29:35.665
I'll protect you from Laurent.

29:35.689 --> 29:38.468
I'll take care of you.
I'll be good to you.

29:38.492 --> 29:40.704
Do you know how many men
have said things like that to me?

29:40.728 --> 29:41.972
I'm not like other men.

29:41.996 --> 29:44.141
All of them.
But you're all liars.

29:44.165 --> 29:47.717
No, no. I swear
on my mother's virtue.

29:48.035 --> 29:49.379
Why should I trust you?

29:49.403 --> 29:51.348
Fernande.

29:51.372 --> 29:54.482
And why in God's name would
I trade one broke artist for another?

29:57.077 --> 29:58.421
I'll take your offer.

29:58.445 --> 30:00.757
What offer?

30:00.781 --> 30:02.526
The 700 francs.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.027
Ah.

30:04.051 --> 30:07.470
I'm told 700 is what Vollard
has paid for a new Matisse.

30:07.822 --> 30:09.933
A masterpiece.

30:09.957 --> 30:11.902
I'm offering
you three paintings.

30:11.926 --> 30:13.943
Ooh.

30:15.429 --> 30:17.847
I will offer you
500 for all of them.

30:18.199 --> 30:21.684
Less, of course, the money
you owe me for the pigment.

30:22.136 --> 30:25.121
To hell with you, Sagot.

30:37.151 --> 30:38.595
I'll take the 500.

30:38.619 --> 30:40.797
Ah, that was two minutes ago.

30:40.821 --> 30:45.775
The offer now is 300.

30:47.661 --> 30:50.780
He's a goddamn thief.
300 francs.

30:51.265 --> 30:54.350
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a lousy 300 francs?

30:54.602 --> 30:57.946
Two years ago you would've
thought that a fortune.

30:58.172 --> 30:59.950
We could feast for a month.

30:59.974 --> 31:01.718
Don't you see?

31:01.742 --> 31:05.288
I wanted to show Fernande that I'm
not just another poor artist.

31:05.312 --> 31:07.005
To get her out of
Bateau-Lavoir, take-take

31:07.029 --> 31:08.391
a fancy apartment
in Montparnasse.

31:08.415 --> 31:09.700
And then what? You'd be

31:09.724 --> 31:11.261
blissfully content and
start painting again?

31:11.285 --> 31:13.536
Yes.

31:15.356 --> 31:18.523
Well, if winning this girl

31:18.547 --> 31:22.020
is the only way to get
you working again,

31:22.696 --> 31:25.141
we'll just have
to make it happen. Won't we?

31:25.165 --> 31:27.010
How?

31:27.034 --> 31:29.312
There's something you
could buy plenty of for 300 francs.

31:29.336 --> 31:32.021
What?

31:37.211 --> 31:40.229
Black magic.

32:11.545 --> 32:14.030
Did you get it?

32:17.518 --> 32:20.736
Opium. The dark mistress.

32:38.739 --> 32:41.891
I'm surprised to see you.

32:44.044 --> 32:45.555
You invited me.

32:45.579 --> 32:49.298
But I wasn't sure
you'd be brave enough to come.

32:49.883 --> 32:52.829
I was curious about the art.

32:52.853 --> 32:55.638
The art? Or the artist?

33:01.428 --> 33:04.113
So how does she rate?

33:05.766 --> 33:09.519
I think she's brilliant.

33:09.837 --> 33:12.855
Tell her yourself.
I'll introduce you.

33:12.940 --> 33:14.918
No, uh, really.

33:14.942 --> 33:17.727
I just, I just wanted
to see the paintings.

33:19.646 --> 33:22.665
Perhaps another time.

33:30.057 --> 33:34.210
Why did you bother to come
if you didn't want to meet her?

33:37.331 --> 33:40.410
I suppose I was trying to
play along with your Bohemian rules.

33:40.434 --> 33:42.579
I told you, I don't have rules.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.849
Well, whatever
you call this game.

33:45.873 --> 33:48.418
It's not as easy as I
thought it would be.

33:48.442 --> 33:51.994
It's not a game. It's life.

33:53.013 --> 33:57.533
Artists must be free.
No restrictions of any kind.

33:58.018 --> 34:01.871
Dora is a Surrealist.
She-She understands.

34:02.990 --> 34:05.541
I'm not Dora.

34:05.592 --> 34:08.978
Maybe this was the-the wrong
place for the two of you to meet.

34:09.530 --> 34:12.547
Maybe we should try again in
a more comfortable setting.

34:19.440 --> 34:23.092
He invited me to
have dinner with him and Dora.

34:23.610 --> 34:26.121
He's got no
shame at all, does he?

34:26.146 --> 34:28.291
He doesn't give a
damn what anyone else thinks.

34:28.315 --> 34:32.001
In fact, the more he offends people,
the more he seems to like it.

34:32.119 --> 34:36.108
It's scandalous, but
it will certainly be interesting.

34:37.623 --> 34:39.344
It's one thing to look the other

34:39.368 --> 34:40.837
way while he sleeps
with other women,

34:40.860 --> 34:45.636
but, I won't be paraded in
public as part of his harem.

34:48.368 --> 34:52.455
You're not actually
in love with him, are you?

35:03.684 --> 35:06.062
Maybe you can have
some fun with it.

35:06.086 --> 35:09.205
Give him a taste of
his own medicine.

35:15.262 --> 35:16.339
Bonsoir.

35:16.363 --> 35:17.707
Bonsoir.

35:17.731 --> 35:19.676
I would like
you to meet Andre Beaudin.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.952
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

35:29.776 --> 35:32.561
You are a
little devil, aren't you?

35:32.679 --> 35:35.731
Well, it seems we
need another setting. Waiter.

35:36.049 --> 35:37.393
Francoise, sit next to me.

35:37.417 --> 35:39.669
I have so many
questions to ask you.

35:48.695 --> 35:51.241
I have seen your paintings.

35:51.265 --> 35:54.183
I think they're extraordinary.

35:54.268 --> 35:58.414
Well, it's true what
you say about this one, Pablo.

35:58.438 --> 36:01.190
She has excellent taste.

36:03.810 --> 36:06.529
He is very handsome.

36:11.785 --> 36:18.040
Waiter, we'll have, um,
caviar, oysters, champagne.

36:18.659 --> 36:21.277
Right away, Madame.

36:22.796 --> 36:25.614
Isn't this fun?

36:27.267 --> 36:29.819
Yeah.

36:30.404 --> 36:32.655
Another, please.

36:33.740 --> 36:36.292
Garçon. Just,
uh, bring the check please.

36:36.610 --> 36:37.987
Right away, sir...

36:38.011 --> 36:39.923
Did I tell you what
happened to me last night?

36:39.947 --> 36:41.157
No.

36:41.181 --> 36:43.293
I was walking
across the Pont Neuf.

36:43.317 --> 36:46.402
A man ran out and
snatched my little dog.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.232
Sorry, that's,
that's, that's terrible.

36:49.256 --> 36:53.754
Poor Pepe. I can't imagine what
that evil man has done with him.

36:55.762 --> 36:58.681
First, your bike's stolen.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.611
Then your dog.

37:01.635 --> 37:04.180
How many times are you
gonna tell these stories?

37:04.204 --> 37:06.749
I don't understand
why you're not more upset.

37:06.773 --> 37:08.818
You love that dog.

37:08.842 --> 37:10.684
But I am sure Francoise would

37:10.708 --> 37:12.886
rather discuss something
more interesting.

37:18.552 --> 37:22.171
It's such a clear night.
Why don't you walk me home?

37:22.456 --> 37:25.274
I am too tired for walking. Huh.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.737
That's what
happens when you get old.

37:27.761 --> 37:30.613
You quit before the
fun even begins.

37:31.064 --> 37:33.883
Go home, Dora. Go home.

37:36.536 --> 37:38.982
I suppose I'll
see you some other time.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.450
Yeah.

37:40.474 --> 37:44.160
If I'm not murdered by
hooligans on the way home.

37:46.013 --> 37:50.266
Thank you for an
interesting evening. Good night.

37:56.857 --> 38:00.276
I really should go with him.

38:01.828 --> 38:05.308
Look, I am not
a fool, Francoise. All right?

38:05.332 --> 38:09.212
It's obvious why you
brought me here tonight.

38:09.236 --> 38:12.721
It's not because you've
got an interest in me.

38:18.278 --> 38:21.464
Are you coming?

38:39.566 --> 38:41.377
Are you sure she's all right?

38:41.401 --> 38:44.180
Don't worry about Dora.

38:44.204 --> 38:47.456
Dora will be fine.

39:44.552 --> 39:46.596
I told you to leave me alone.

39:46.620 --> 39:49.024
What if I told
you I have something

39:49.048 --> 39:51.265
that can take away
all your sadness?

39:59.533 --> 40:01.912
You cleaned.

40:01.936 --> 40:04.381
I did it for you.

40:04.405 --> 40:07.257
You didn't seem
to like it dirty.

40:08.242 --> 40:11.027
What about the dust?
Your paintings?

40:11.545 --> 40:14.597
I just want
you to be comfortable.

40:19.954 --> 40:22.132
Do you know what this is?

40:22.156 --> 40:23.633
For opium.

40:23.657 --> 40:25.702
Have you tried it?

40:25.726 --> 40:28.205
You just want me out of my
head so I'll let you screw me again.

40:28.229 --> 40:30.774
No, you-you don't
have to do anything.

40:30.798 --> 40:34.517
I just want you to feel good.

40:35.469 --> 40:40.223
I would build you a castle, or sail
you away on a magnificent yacht.

40:41.308 --> 40:43.587
But I can't do any of that.

40:43.611 --> 40:45.822
Um, I want to make you happy.

40:45.846 --> 40:49.232
At least for a little while.

41:52.713 --> 41:56.466
I want to show you something.

42:11.398 --> 42:14.317
I don't understand.

42:14.935 --> 42:18.421
It's a shrine. To you.

42:20.274 --> 42:22.486
But why?

42:22.510 --> 42:26.963
Because I worship you, Fernande.

42:31.785 --> 42:35.699
I know you didn't
want me to draw you.

42:35.723 --> 42:38.335
Are you angry?

42:38.359 --> 42:44.614
No, I, no, it's,
you make me look so beautiful.

42:47.468 --> 42:52.455
Sometimes I can't find the
right words to say what I feel.

42:53.574 --> 42:58.428
But I can with my
pencils and brushes.

43:08.322 --> 43:10.133
You don't have to.

43:10.157 --> 43:13.509
I want to.

43:21.769 --> 43:23.780
Dora. What happened?

43:23.804 --> 43:25.749
A man attacked me.

43:25.773 --> 43:28.051
He stole my dog and my bicycle.

43:28.075 --> 43:30.120
It was terrible.

43:30.144 --> 43:33.529
We found her wandering along the river,
but there was no evidence of an attack.

43:34.248 --> 43:36.526
These idiots would not believe
me, so I made them bring me.

43:36.550 --> 43:40.036
Tell them. Tell them, Pablo.

43:40.654 --> 43:43.133
Tell them what has
happened to me.

43:43.157 --> 43:44.968
Thank you for bringing her here.

43:44.992 --> 43:46.870
You can go now.
I'll take care of her.

43:46.894 --> 43:49.739
Forgive me, Monsieur, but perhaps
you should take her to the hospital.

43:49.763 --> 43:52.348
I don't think she's
in her right mind.

43:52.366 --> 43:54.851
All right. Thank you.

43:57.371 --> 44:01.057
Oh, Pablo.

44:03.210 --> 44:04.421
Come, come, come, come, come.

44:04.445 --> 44:06.996
You crazy slut!

44:07.781 --> 44:10.117
After everything I've done
for you, you're gonna

44:10.141 --> 44:12.292
leave me for this dirty
little foreigner!

44:12.820 --> 44:16.239
If you come near
her again, I will kill you.

44:42.549 --> 44:46.202
We're going to be happy now.

44:59.500 --> 45:01.845
Is she doing any better?

45:01.869 --> 45:05.582
Uh. The doctor
gave her a sedative.

45:05.606 --> 45:07.350
Yeah, she'll be fine.

45:07.374 --> 45:08.852
She won't be fine.

45:08.876 --> 45:10.820
She's a Surrealist.

45:10.844 --> 45:14.330
They all go mad sooner or later.

45:14.581 --> 45:17.800
Pablo, that is absurd.

45:18.252 --> 45:19.596
She needs some rest.

45:19.620 --> 45:21.031
A couple of weeks in Antibes.

45:21.055 --> 45:23.700
Can't you see she's suffering?

45:23.724 --> 45:25.535
A holiday isn't
going to solve that.

45:25.559 --> 45:28.071
Oh, no?
What do you suggest then?

45:28.095 --> 45:29.873
Mademoiselle Dr. Gilot?

45:29.897 --> 45:32.248
I don't know.

45:33.100 --> 45:37.954
But what I do know is that this,

45:39.907 --> 45:44.020
what we're doing,
you think she doesn't mind,

45:44.044 --> 45:47.757
because she's such a free thinker,
but she does mind very much,

45:47.781 --> 45:50.226
and it's hurting her, and
it's making her worse.

45:50.250 --> 45:53.502
Don't be such a narcissist.

45:53.821 --> 45:56.706
It's got nothing to do with you.

45:59.059 --> 46:00.570
I'm sorry.

46:00.594 --> 46:02.572
I thought I could do things
your way, but I can't.

46:02.596 --> 46:07.149
Maybe Dora was right.
Maybe you're still a child.

46:09.603 --> 46:12.951
Maybe. But I
am going to look after

46:12.975 --> 46:15.972
myself, and I hope
you look after Dora.

46:23.984 --> 46:25.995
It will be over soon.

46:26.019 --> 46:28.571
Please. I don't
want this. Please. Please.

46:38.632 --> 46:40.816
Clear.

46:46.807 --> 46:49.986
I've told you before, no private
matters on company time.

46:50.010 --> 46:52.355
What is this nonsense?

46:52.379 --> 46:54.624
It is my work.

46:54.648 --> 46:58.200
You are confused, Kostrowistzky.
This is your work.

46:59.052 --> 47:01.097
Not anymore.

47:01.121 --> 47:04.774
I'm a published art
critic now and a poet.

47:06.627 --> 47:09.305
"Throwing his ink
towards the heavens,

47:09.329 --> 47:11.107
sucking the
blood of what he likes,

47:11.131 --> 47:15.885
and finding it delicious,
this inhuman monster.

47:16.670 --> 47:19.956
It is me!"

47:22.676 --> 47:25.828
"Brushed my shadows of the dead,

47:25.879 --> 47:28.558
The blind man
rocks pretty child,

47:28.582 --> 47:31.767
The doe with all
her fauns slips by,

47:33.520 --> 47:36.605
The dwarf observes
with saddened pose,

47:37.324 --> 47:41.577
How Harlequin magically grows."

47:44.031 --> 47:46.042
It's wonderful, Guillaume.

47:46.066 --> 47:49.546
It captures the mood
of the picture perfectly.

47:49.570 --> 47:52.421
We have done it, Pablo.

47:53.173 --> 47:56.926
All of those academic graybeards
will be apoplectic when they see it.

47:58.345 --> 48:02.131
When the Autumn Salon
opens, you'll both be sensations.

48:08.956 --> 48:11.841
They have to
accept my painting first.

48:23.270 --> 48:25.254
I'll be right back.

48:58.005 --> 49:01.323
Matisse.

49:10.350 --> 49:12.595
We're leaving.

49:12.619 --> 49:13.830
I don't understand.

49:13.854 --> 49:15.231
I'm not submitting it.

49:15.255 --> 49:18.968
But why?

49:18.992 --> 49:21.343
It's not good enough.
