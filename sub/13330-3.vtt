WEBVTT

00:07.040 --> 00:09.242
Here we go again.

00:09.309 --> 00:12.045
We're back in Newcastle.
You know what that means.

00:12.112 --> 00:13.446
It means fucking chaos.

00:13.513 --> 00:15.482
Bucking, birds and banter.

00:15.548 --> 00:16.816
I've got a boyfriend.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.119
So we're looking
at two new housemates.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.422
If there's new talent in the house,
I've got first dibs.

00:22.489 --> 00:25.492
I grill more birds
than George Foreman. All right?

00:25.558 --> 00:28.294
I'm young, I'm fresh
and I love bucking birds.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.964
(all) New boys! (all cheer)

00:31.030 --> 00:33.466
Ding, ding.
Not on the first fucking night.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.602
I can see this all ending in tears.

00:35.668 --> 00:38.905
Cock is going to be
getting inserted.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.408
It's Vicky and Ricci's
engagement party.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.309
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

00:44.911 --> 00:48.415
He's here. If I was Gary,
I would be shitting meself.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.452
It's going fucking amazing.

00:52.519 --> 00:53.520
Fucking slag!

00:53.586 --> 00:55.121
Biggest argument ever.

00:55.188 --> 00:57.824
Engagement party's been
a fucking joke.

00:58.758 --> 01:00.560
Last night was a disaster.

01:00.627 --> 01:04.096
(Anna) I've asked Vicky, Ricci
and Sophie to leave the house.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.966
As long as I've got me and Scott
going out pulling.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.771
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.007
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:14.073 --> 01:16.342
If you look up pulling,
I'm next to it.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.411
I'd not kiss a guy
without a six-pack.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.480
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.482
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:22.549 --> 01:24.584
Got the looks, the charm.
Just works.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.053
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.888
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

01:28.955 --> 01:31.391
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:41.034 --> 01:43.036
(alarm clock rings)

01:45.572 --> 01:48.308
(Charlotte) # I like big butts
And I can not lie

01:48.374 --> 01:50.410
# All the other brothers can't deny #

01:55.715 --> 01:59.686
What are them?
Scott's boxers.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.826
Nothing's right after our party.

02:06.893 --> 02:08.862
Ricci and Sophie have had to leave.

02:08.928 --> 02:11.764
I'm missing Ricci
and Charlotte's missing Sophie.

02:11.831 --> 02:12.966
It's not nice.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.968
I miss Sophie, me partner in crime.

02:15.034 --> 02:18.805
I don't know when she's gonna come
back. It just doesn't feel right.

02:20.006 --> 02:23.009
I wake up this morning
and I go to the shower

02:23.076 --> 02:25.378
and I'm just washing me boob

02:25.445 --> 02:29.349
and I look down
and I'm like, "whoa."

02:29.415 --> 02:32.452
Me implant's turned round
in me boob.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.722
What?
Look at the side there.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.224
Touch it. That's the back bit.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.959
Holly's woke up this morning

02:40.026 --> 02:43.463
and her normally massive round tits
are really weird.

02:43.530 --> 02:47.200
One's massive and round
and one's flat like a plate.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.935
How the fuck has it done that?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.838
Like, all under there,
that's the flat bit.

02:51.905 --> 02:55.341
I haven't got much sympathy
for Holly and her twisting boob.

02:55.408 --> 02:58.378
What do you expect
when you get implants that size?

02:58.444 --> 03:00.013
Ring the booby police.

03:00.079 --> 03:03.149
The flat bit that's usually lying
on the back of me chest

03:03.216 --> 03:04.284
was at the front.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.919
I don't think it's working!

03:08.755 --> 03:11.624
She's pulling her tit
in all different angles.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.627
I'm cringing.
I'm like, "Ow. Is that not hurting?"

03:14.694 --> 03:16.329
Eh? Eh?

03:16.396 --> 03:19.399
All of a sudden,
it just went back into place.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.935
(laughs)

03:22.001 --> 03:23.836
Oh, my God.

03:23.903 --> 03:26.539
It worked. I could be a surgeon.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.441
# Go, Holly
You flipped your boob round

03:28.508 --> 03:30.476
# Go, Holly
You flipped your boob round #

03:31.811 --> 03:35.648
(Vicky) The weekend's about to start.
We're gonna be going out loads.

03:35.715 --> 03:38.651
As every girl knows,
you have to be tanned to the max.

03:42.121 --> 03:45.058
Obviously I got my spray tan

03:45.124 --> 03:48.428
so that when my two sons,
Scramble and Egg, look at me,

03:48.494 --> 03:50.797
they'll know
that I am actually their mam.

03:58.271 --> 04:02.175
I've noticed a change in James.
He's more confident this time round.

04:02.241 --> 04:06.079
He's not running around after
Scott and Gaz, trying to pull birds.

04:06.145 --> 04:09.248
He's just... different.

04:09.315 --> 04:11.217
I have got a confession to make.

04:11.284 --> 04:15.121
I've got meself a bird
and she's a fucking worldie.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.690
Me and Holly are friends.
We get on well. There's no flanter.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.560
So I'm gonna take her on a walk

04:20.627 --> 04:23.162
and I'm hoping when I do tell her
about me bird,

04:23.229 --> 04:26.099
she's not gonna be bothered
or get jealous.

04:26.165 --> 04:28.167
I'm not sure how she's gonna take it.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.342
Proper different this time round,
don't you think?

04:36.409 --> 04:38.077
What, like...

04:38.144 --> 04:41.347
Everything's just totally changed,
hasn't it? I know.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.851
When we were in Cancun, she was
starting to get feelings for us.

04:44.917 --> 04:47.520
And I don't want it to be that way.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.123
We had fun in Mexico.
We did have a good time.

04:50.189 --> 04:51.624
Aye. You looked after us.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.526
"Is your shin all right?"

04:53.593 --> 04:56.529
"Is your quad all right?
Oh, there's the cock."

04:56.596 --> 04:58.931
"That's definitely all right."
(laughs)

04:58.998 --> 05:01.768
It is actually good
to spend time with Holly

05:01.834 --> 05:03.803
without her trying to grab me cock.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.372
We're actually having
a really good time

05:06.439 --> 05:08.207
and we're getting along well.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.609
(grunts)

05:11.010 --> 05:14.447
I haven't heard you make them noises
in a while, mind, Holly.

05:14.514 --> 05:16.082
Fuck off.

05:16.149 --> 05:20.119
I can't do it. I don't think
today is the right day to tell Holly,

05:20.186 --> 05:22.922
cos I think
she's still got feelings for us.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.857
This is a friendship feather.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.225
You can keep this.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.039
This weekend...

05:40.106 --> 05:42.341
This weekend we'll fucking clean up.

05:42.408 --> 05:46.279
I am spending a lot of time with
Scott. We are the same person.

05:46.345 --> 05:47.380
We think the same.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.815
Next level banging.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.554
The Buck Squad's
fucking on the loose.

05:55.588 --> 05:59.258
The Buck Squad is
just a hilarious term

05:59.325 --> 06:02.228
for two silly little boys

06:02.295 --> 06:05.665
trying to stick their penis
in any kind of hole.

06:05.732 --> 06:08.935
(laughs) Here's
to the fucking Buck Squad.

06:10.436 --> 06:14.841
Dan is desperate to get involved,
but I feel like he's an apprentice.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.610
He's not worthy of being
in the Buck Squad yet.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.345
They have a bromance going on.

06:19.412 --> 06:22.248
It's like Brokeback Mountain,
but without horses.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.283
I'm gonna do me own thing.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.453
They can be the Buck Squad.
I'd rather be the Lone Boner.

06:30.389 --> 06:32.191
(phone rings)

06:33.526 --> 06:34.560
Hello?

06:34.627 --> 06:37.330
(Anna) "Hiya.
I've got a job this afternoon."

06:37.396 --> 06:39.699
Right.
"It's a massage. Scott and Gaz."

06:39.766 --> 06:42.201
"Tell them to get ready, please."
Right, OK.

06:42.268 --> 06:43.302
"Thank you. Bye."

06:43.369 --> 06:45.905
Me and Scott have got
our first massaging job.

06:45.972 --> 06:49.575
I just hope it's a mint bird that
I can just fucking rub up and down.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.546
Imagine if they're two wicked birds.
Two birds.

06:53.613 --> 06:57.650
I'll start necking on them.
I'll probably get a fucking stiffy.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.052
Fucking hell.

07:02.555 --> 07:03.723
All right?
Heya.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.425
Get the door and the first one's OK.

07:06.492 --> 07:07.660
Blonde. Nice body.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.196
I just pray
the next one's even better.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.366
Rocking the sexy look, lads.

07:14.333 --> 07:18.237
Fucking hell. It's like a cross
between Shamu and King Kong.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.577
If they're the Bucking Squad,
what are we?

07:24.644 --> 07:26.445
I was gonna say that.
What are we?

07:26.512 --> 07:27.814
We're the fucking...

07:27.880 --> 07:31.117
We're the "sabotage
the cock suckers" team.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.418
(all laugh)

07:32.485 --> 07:34.654
Cockblock Crusaders.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.722
Yes!
Yeah!

07:36.789 --> 07:38.257
The girls are sick to death

07:38.324 --> 07:41.227
of seeing Scott and Gaz
bring back gargoyles.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.497
So they've set up a group called
the Cockblock Crusaders.

07:44.564 --> 07:47.066
We are the Cockblock Crusaders.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.734
Suck on that.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.570
Master plan.
Master plan.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.708
I don't like the smell of me cup.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.847
(Gaz) The skinny bird's gotten
on my bed. Scott's got the hippo.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.717
It's like massaging a fridge.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.419
Let's give this a bash.

08:06.485 --> 08:10.056
How hot is a massage?
It's oil, my hand and a bird.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.757
Three things I fucking love.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.438
I sense tension.
Better get rid of these knots.

08:27.006 --> 08:30.243
They were canny, like, weren't they?
Aye. Not bad, like.

08:47.727 --> 08:50.329
Why does this mirror lie?
I know.

08:50.396 --> 08:53.966
Don't. I've had this conversation
with it so many times.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.772
All hitting Tup Tup. It's one of
the best clubs in town. I can't wait.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.608
It's the perfect place to pick us up
out of me funk.

09:02.675 --> 09:04.844
I'm missing Ricci so much.

09:04.911 --> 09:08.881
The Buck Squad are still in the
bathroom, polishing their bell ends.

09:08.948 --> 09:12.451
We're gonna head off to Tup Tup
while they get ready like girls.

09:12.518 --> 09:13.853
Boom!

09:13.920 --> 09:18.257
(girls) Cockblock Crusaders!
Cockblock Crusaders!

09:18.324 --> 09:21.928
Gaz? What?
Have you seen me shower gel?

09:24.463 --> 09:28.000
(girls) All the cocks getting blocked
by the crusaders.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.704
We are the Cockblock Crusaders!

09:39.745 --> 09:42.448
It's Friday night.
We're ready for the weekend.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.450
We're hitting Tup Tup.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.924
(all) Cockblock Crusaders!

09:53.592 --> 09:55.962
(all) Road trip, road trip,
road trip!

09:56.028 --> 09:57.463
(girls scream)

09:57.530 --> 09:59.432
I love Liverpool. Bring it on.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.934
Where is the fanny?

10:03.002 --> 10:04.937
Cockblock Crusaders!

10:05.004 --> 10:07.707
I've got this feeling
in the gut of me belly,

10:07.773 --> 10:10.142
like death coming out of me mouth.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.778
Why is Charlotte crawling in my room?

10:12.845 --> 10:14.947
This is a disaster.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.650
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:33.232 --> 10:37.169
So, it's Friday night. We're
all ready to get fucking mortal.

10:38.904 --> 10:41.440
Dan seems to be a lot more relaxed.

10:41.507 --> 10:44.710
He's having a good night.
He's even pulled himself a bird.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.381
I'm having a mint night.
Scott's not there,

10:48.447 --> 10:51.050
so he's not trying
to rob one of me birds.

11:04.663 --> 11:08.000
Me and Gaz rock up outside the club,
fashionably late.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.304
Where's the fucking fanny?

11:17.243 --> 11:19.645
The Cockblock Crusaders
are on this Earth

11:19.712 --> 11:23.215
to stop Gary and Scott
from bucking anything with a pulse.

11:23.282 --> 11:25.451
Cockblock Crusaders!

11:29.555 --> 11:32.892
(Vicky) Dan is trying his hardest,
bless him, to fit in.

11:32.958 --> 11:36.062
He's trying to pull and have
a bit of a laugh with us lot.

11:36.128 --> 11:38.364
He manages to get lasses in.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.732
The Buck Squad turn up.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.470
The first thing Scott does
is rob my bird from under my nose.

11:46.472 --> 11:47.807
I'm fucking raging.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.881
Feeling gutted for Dan.
I'm already necking on.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.951
He's been grafting for hours.
He's getting nowhere.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.457
I don't know how he can sit there
and let him.

12:04.523 --> 12:06.892
If it was me,
I'd be going fucking mental.

12:13.532 --> 12:15.000
Is he trying to mug us off?

12:17.803 --> 12:22.875
I'm absolutely mortal,
but not as mortal as Charlotte.

12:27.646 --> 12:31.484
(Charlotte) The Cockblock Crusaders
have succeeded in our mission

12:31.550 --> 12:33.486
to block all of the cock.

12:33.552 --> 12:35.421
We have got so drunk tonight

12:35.488 --> 12:38.491
that the lads can't concentrate
on any of the fanny

12:38.557 --> 12:40.793
and have to look after us
and take us home.

12:42.228 --> 12:45.798
Charlotte's practically getting
carried in. She's mortal.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.801
I've got this strange feeling
in the gut of my belly.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.002
Is it worry?

12:50.069 --> 12:51.403
Is it heartache?

12:51.470 --> 12:53.239
Is it sorrow?

12:54.406 --> 12:56.742
Get it out.
Oh, my God.

12:56.809 --> 12:58.244
It's just black.

12:58.310 --> 13:02.214
Thick, horrible sick.
Like death coming out of me mouth.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.316
Being sick is horrible.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.952
It's just like
swallowing cum the wrong way.

13:08.154 --> 13:10.289
Holly's absolutely smashed as well.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.558
As a good mate,
I'm gonna put her to bed.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.293
I can't even get up the stairs.

13:14.360 --> 13:17.930
It's a shame that it's not gonna
end up with me touching his cock.

13:17.997 --> 13:20.933
But I'm gonna make sure
I padlock my door tonight,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.535
cos I don't want any visits.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.908
(Gaz) I'm in bed. I'm dozing off.
I've had a big night.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.544
I see this head
pop round the corner.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.879
Hair and make-up all over the place.

13:33.946 --> 13:37.049
She looked like the fucking Grudge
or something.

13:37.116 --> 13:39.718
Why is Charlotte crawling
in my room?

13:39.785 --> 13:42.421
Why am I getting into Gary's bed?

13:42.488 --> 13:46.425
Is it just because it's so familiar,
or is it just because I'm a slag?

13:47.526 --> 13:50.629
It is always tempting
when Charlotte crawls in me bed.

13:50.696 --> 13:55.000
Going to Gary's room to pretend for
a second that Gary's me boyfriend.

13:56.235 --> 14:00.039
Best thing to do is get out of the
situation and get in Ricci's bed.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.675
I wouldn't want
to spoil her relationship.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.917
Fuck.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.622
I'm starting to realise
how bad this is.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.158
I'm in Gary's bed
and I've got a boyfriend.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.261
Scott's me good mate,

14:22.328 --> 14:25.998
so I don't want to see Charlotte
trying to jump back in Gaz's bed.

14:26.065 --> 14:29.101
Moonie!
Oh, man. Get out and get ready.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.369
You're annoying us.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.905
She doesn't know what she's doing
with that.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.641
I don't know why she wants
to crawl into that bed.

14:35.708 --> 14:39.144
I thought that was done and dusted,
chapter closed.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.613
What are you doing, man?

14:42.047 --> 14:44.450
Charlotte has woke up this morning

14:44.516 --> 14:46.652
and thought,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

14:46.719 --> 14:48.087
She will regret it.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.588
This is a disaster.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.828
It doesn't feel right,
waking up without Ricci.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.364
I hope Anna's gonna let him
come back soon.

14:58.430 --> 15:02.067
Sophie can stay out forever
as far as I'm concerned, like.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.837
(James) Girls. How you feeling?
Minging.

15:04.903 --> 15:06.338
Right, we've got an idea.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.074
Why don't we go on a road trip?
Where?

15:10.409 --> 15:11.877
Liverpool?

15:11.944 --> 15:14.346
You're up for Liverpool?
Are you sure?

15:14.413 --> 15:17.082
I fucking love Liverpool.
Bring it on.

15:17.149 --> 15:21.320
The last thing I want to do
is go on a road trip with Gary.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.622
I wish Sophie was here
to come with us.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.924
Liverpool is
my favourite place ever.

15:25.991 --> 15:28.027
That accent on girls... I love it.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.429
When you bang a Scouse bird
all you hear is,

15:30.496 --> 15:32.765
"Fuck us! Fuck us harder!" Oh!

15:32.831 --> 15:34.867
I think there is a lot of similarity

15:34.933 --> 15:37.403
between Geordie girls
and Scouse lasses.

15:37.469 --> 15:40.906
They put effort into the way
they look, but to the next level.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.809
Rollers in from a Saturday morning,
big eye lashes.

15:43.876 --> 15:45.644
They're just gorgeous.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.358
(all) Road trip, road trip,
road trip!

15:59.425 --> 16:01.026
(all cheer)

16:01.093 --> 16:02.761
Yeah! You're so excited!

16:02.828 --> 16:06.198
I'm so angry.
(Scott) Who's twisted your knickers?

16:19.945 --> 16:22.247
The best way to start the day
is to shop,

16:22.314 --> 16:25.317
have a bit of girly banter
and get ready for tonight.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.162
I hate meself.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.765
I thought this weekend
was gonna be brilliant

16:39.832 --> 16:42.735
and a proper chance for us all
to have, like, some fun

16:42.801 --> 16:45.371
and girly time.
But Charlotte is miserable.

16:45.437 --> 16:49.775
Let's shop. Let's have some fun.
Let's smile. Jesus Christ.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.811
Miserable bastards.

16:54.947 --> 16:58.050
She's not finished with Scott.
They're together.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.854
She doesn't know what she wants,
whether she wants him back or what.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.522
Now she's done this with Gaz.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.958
I don't know what's happening
with us.

17:06.023 --> 17:08.026
I could take a good guess at it.

17:08.093 --> 17:11.396
I think for starters,
you're a scruffy bastard.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.332
Last time I tried to get involved,

17:13.398 --> 17:15.601
I ended up punched
in the face by Sophie.

17:15.666 --> 17:18.971
So I've got no desire
to go sticking my nose in this shit.

17:19.037 --> 17:21.773
I'm so confused.
I just don't know what to do.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.309
Stop putting so much pressure
on yourself.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.178
We're in Liverpool.

17:26.244 --> 17:29.748
I hate pigeons! You cannae tell
what they're thinking.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.151
Lads, how about we frisk in here
for a bit?

17:33.719 --> 17:37.823
I cannot wait to get out. I just
hope there's some birds left for you.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.526
They'll be cleaning up,
left, right and centre.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.397
I knew it was love at first sight

17:45.464 --> 17:48.734
when Gaz and Scott came
wearing matching t-shirts.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.438
And now they're wearing
matching trainers.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.908
What's next?
A fucking puppy called Tinker Bell?

17:55.974 --> 17:57.810
Fucking hell, man.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.048
(Vicky) There's loads to see.

18:03.115 --> 18:05.584
The best way to do it all
is to get the Quacker.

18:05.651 --> 18:09.087
It is half-bus and half-boat.
(horn blares)

18:14.693 --> 18:15.928
(cheering)

18:23.001 --> 18:24.803
That was shit.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.241
So, I'm so hungover,
the Duck Tour is shit

18:29.308 --> 18:31.810
and James is treating me
like I'm invisible.

18:31.877 --> 18:35.814
We used to have really good flanter
and now something's changed.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.684
And straight away I noticed
Holly's miserable.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.253
I'm thinking,
"What the fuck do I do?"

18:41.320 --> 18:43.455
I can't get my cock out
and cheer her up.

18:50.362 --> 18:52.064
Are youse two both taken?

18:52.130 --> 18:54.533
Because Holly's single, you know.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.135
I'm single.
Ah, well!

18:57.202 --> 19:00.038
Are you ready to mingle?
I'm always ready to mingle.

19:00.105 --> 19:04.042
You could be in for a bloody treat.
I'm always ready to mingle.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.279
Do you want to drive?
Can I have a go?

19:07.346 --> 19:11.316
So, when I decide to have a go on
the boat, I'm a little bit nervous.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.619
It's more for the others on board.

19:13.685 --> 19:18.323
Turn left, turn left. Left, quick!

19:19.324 --> 19:22.728
Vicky's driving the boat.
She hasn't got a driving licence.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.863
Never mind a Duck Boat licence.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.835
Fucking hell!

19:38.043 --> 19:39.044
Ricci's not here,

19:39.111 --> 19:42.281
but that's not gonna stop us
going out and pulling birds.

19:42.347 --> 19:45.250
Ricci was
not part of the Buck Squad anyway.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.564
The Buck Squad are
getting on me tits.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.366
The Lone Boner's
a force to be reckoned with.

20:01.433 --> 20:04.069
I reckon when they go out,
those two will be

20:04.136 --> 20:06.772
racing to get back
and get that spare room.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.942
They will. That's all
they'll be talking about now.

20:10.008 --> 20:14.246
Tactics. Discussing military
operations on how to pull birds.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.817
We'll just dust them
every way that we can.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.320
Come back.
Have a few drinks, then split off.

20:21.386 --> 20:25.524
There'll be that much thrusting,
they'll think there's an earthquake.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.160
It would be funny
if you got a bird back,

20:28.226 --> 20:30.729
swooped in and stole the spare.

20:30.796 --> 20:34.266
Shag pad straight away.
They'd probably be happy about that.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.202
They could share the room
and watch each other.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.771
Fucking Buck Squad.

20:42.107 --> 20:43.108
I know.

20:45.010 --> 20:48.714
Me and Holly are going hyper
and we're gonna need a diaper.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.322
I'm sick of them all banging on
about pulling and birds.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.491
I've got something to tell youse.

20:59.558 --> 21:03.695
This is gonna hit Holly like bricks.
I feel a little bit like... (sighs)

21:03.762 --> 21:06.732
I need to tell me boyfriend, Scott,
about Gary.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.066
"Hello?"
Hi, Scott.

21:08.133 --> 21:11.303
(doorbell rings)
And the doorbell goes. Fuck.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.040
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:32.090 --> 21:33.892
We're gonna have a massive night

21:33.959 --> 21:36.561
and show these Scousers
how the Geordies do it.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.764
Charlotte, I'm not being funny,

21:38.830 --> 21:41.633
but you could have cleaned
the sick off your shoes.

21:47.572 --> 21:50.308
Now we're gonna go
absolutely berserk.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.153
The ratio of girls to boys
is fucking mint.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.291
I've never seen so many stunning
girls in one place in my life.

22:12.464 --> 22:13.932
I need to tell the lads.

22:13.999 --> 22:18.003
I'm sick of them banging on about
pulling and birds and me not pulling.

22:27.345 --> 22:28.980
Gaz, like, curls his face up,

22:29.047 --> 22:32.050
but to be honest,
I never expected him to understand.

22:32.117 --> 22:35.320
He's going to be the one,
lonely in an old people's home,

22:35.387 --> 22:38.223
still trying to buck
the easiest granny.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.258
So I look over at James

22:40.325 --> 22:44.362
and I see them all being
very congratulatory.

22:46.665 --> 22:50.469
And I feel a little bit like...
(sighs)

22:54.306 --> 22:57.008
Holly's sitting sulking. She's upset.

22:57.075 --> 23:00.612
I'm just hoping it's not because
she's found out I've got a bird.

23:00.679 --> 23:04.216
Right now
I'm just completely drained.

23:04.282 --> 23:08.053
I can't try any harder to have
a good night. It's just not working.

23:09.287 --> 23:12.491
They're sitting in the corner,
faces like smacked arses.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.160
Doesn't bother me. More drink.
I'm on the pull.

23:23.668 --> 23:25.771
I really want Dan to pull tonight.

23:25.837 --> 23:28.473
For once,
I want him to come out on top.

23:29.708 --> 23:30.809
I've pulled.

23:30.876 --> 23:33.912
This girl's definitely game
for coming back. I'm in.

23:39.117 --> 23:41.052
Scott's girls aren't game.

23:43.989 --> 23:48.026
If Scott can't get his own girl,
he'll always try and pinch Dan's.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.598
What does he do? Come and talk
to one of my birds again.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.767
I'm not having it.
I'm sick to death.

23:57.869 --> 23:59.371
It's happened again.

23:59.437 --> 24:02.741
Scott's committed another robbery
on one of Dan's birds.

24:02.808 --> 24:05.610
Scott's trying to impress Gary
by nicking my birds.

24:05.677 --> 24:08.180
He's so far up Gary's arse
it's unbelievable.

24:08.246 --> 24:10.882
If you see your mate
talking to two girls

24:10.949 --> 24:13.118
and one of them looks bored
shitless,

24:13.185 --> 24:16.054
you go and talk to that girl.
"Are you all right?"

24:18.290 --> 24:22.460
Scott did that. Wingmanning Dan.
Dan kicks off. Why's he kicking off?

24:22.527 --> 24:24.763
He's got his bird,
Scott's got his bird.

24:24.830 --> 24:27.299
He can't have both.
You've only got one cock.

24:27.365 --> 24:31.036
You're fucking grafting
your hardest just to chat to one.

24:42.514 --> 24:46.284
Tonight's a disaster.
Ricci's not here, Charlotte's down.

24:46.351 --> 24:48.820
Holly's fucking crying
every ten seconds.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.121
I just want to go home.

24:51.690 --> 24:54.726
Me and Scott have two birds.
We're off to the hotel.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.964
Fuck's sake.
Gaz and Scott have got girls.

25:02.334 --> 25:06.504
Back at the hotel. Get in the room,
get in bed and let the graft begin.

25:07.439 --> 25:12.377
Go on, little Dan. Looks like
the only one who hasn't pulled. Aw.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.580
Liverpool can fuck off.
I hate Liverpool.

25:15.647 --> 25:19.484
The only thing I'm munching on
tonight is a bacon butty. Fuck.

25:27.425 --> 25:29.861
(Scott) Not bothered
I didn't get a bang.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.764
I'll be back
like a fucking shark attack. (laughs)

25:43.708 --> 25:48.480
Last night was the shittest night
I've ever been out.

25:48.546 --> 25:51.850
Hi.
Hi. (laughs)

25:52.951 --> 25:55.787
Scott comes in
and tells us about the night before.

25:55.854 --> 26:00.058
It turns out that after all the graft
him and Gaz put into these birds,

26:00.125 --> 26:01.927
all they both did was cuddle.

26:01.993 --> 26:04.829
And you got pied.
(all laugh)

26:04.896 --> 26:07.632
Epic fail.
(both) Fail!

26:09.768 --> 26:11.002
I'm starting to think

26:11.069 --> 26:14.205
the Bucking Squad might not be
an appropriate name.

26:14.272 --> 26:16.975
Maybe they should be called
the Spooning Squad.

26:17.042 --> 26:18.543
Or the Cuddling Crew.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.645
Something along those lines.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.483
Liverpool's been mint.

26:25.550 --> 26:27.285
We've all had a class weekend.

26:27.352 --> 26:29.487
But it's time
to get back to the Toon.

26:47.172 --> 26:48.173
(doorbell rings)

26:52.544 --> 26:54.746
(doorbell rings)
All right.

26:56.147 --> 26:57.882
(laughs)

26:57.949 --> 26:59.884
Yes.
You all right?

26:59.951 --> 27:02.220
Been back ten minutes.
Doorbell rings.

27:02.287 --> 27:05.090
Ricci's back.
Buzzing to see him again.

27:05.156 --> 27:07.225
Nearly got a full house.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.294
Vicky!

27:09.361 --> 27:12.597
Anna kicked me and Sophie out
after the engagement party.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.300
I've cooled down now.
I'm allowed back.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.769
I'm buzzing,
cos I've really missed Vicky.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.371
Oh, I'm fucking buzzing.

27:19.437 --> 27:21.606
I can hear that it's Ricci there

27:21.673 --> 27:25.276
and honestly I just cannae
get down the stairs quick enough.

27:25.343 --> 27:26.945
You all right?

27:27.012 --> 27:30.348
Ricci's back and it's awkward.
Things haven't been sorted

27:30.415 --> 27:33.251
since the fight
at the engagement party.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.720
Sophie's hit Vicky,
which I know is wrong,

27:35.787 --> 27:38.523
but she's me best friend
and I need to support her.

27:38.590 --> 27:41.259
Did you say hello to Ricci?
Yeah, I did. I said hi.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.762
But I just let the boys,
cos the boys went over

27:43.828 --> 27:45.497
and then you wanted to see him.

27:45.563 --> 27:47.932
Yeah. No, no, that's fine.
That's OK.

27:47.999 --> 27:51.536
I think that's nice. I just don't
want there to be any animosity.

27:51.603 --> 27:54.439
I don't want it to be awkward.

27:54.506 --> 27:58.610
I just want everyone to be
one happy family and get on.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.413
That's never, ever,
gonna fucking happen.

28:02.881 --> 28:05.183
Right. Gonna go
make the magic happen.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.887
Me and Vicky think,
"Haven't seen each other."

28:08.953 --> 28:10.422
Straight to the bungalow.

28:10.488 --> 28:11.990
Have a little spoon.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.429
(doorbell rings)

28:20.598 --> 28:22.167
Why-aye! (laughs)

28:22.233 --> 28:24.736
It's a face I'm finally glad to see.

28:24.803 --> 28:26.571
It's Sophie. She's back.

28:26.638 --> 28:27.872
Me partner in crime.

28:29.808 --> 28:33.244
After the engagement party,
Anna told us to leave the house.

28:33.311 --> 28:35.947
But it's been a few days
and I'm allowed back.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.283
I just know I've got
to apologise to Vicky

28:38.349 --> 28:40.785
and I don't know
how this is gonna go down.

28:48.159 --> 28:51.329
Sophie arrives back at the house.
I'm not too fussed.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.466
All I want is her to apologise
to Vicky for hitting her.

28:56.801 --> 29:00.105
The atmosphere is tense.
You could cut it with a knife.

29:00.171 --> 29:04.175
It doesn't look like Sophie is going
to apologise to Vicky any time soon.

29:13.051 --> 29:15.086
It feels mint to be
back in the house.

29:15.153 --> 29:19.390
Charlotte is filling us in
with what's been going on.

29:26.865 --> 29:30.735
I can't believe Charlotte
has crawled into Gary's bed

29:30.802 --> 29:33.138
when she's still got a boyfriend.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.073
This is bad.

29:46.117 --> 29:50.021
I need to tell me boyfriend, Scott,
about how I got into bed with Gary

29:50.088 --> 29:51.890
before he finds out off anyone.

29:54.492 --> 29:56.895
Charlotte is very, very honest.

29:56.961 --> 30:00.665
Sometimes she's too honest.
I know she's got to tell Scott.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.867
I don't know how he's gonna react.

30:13.645 --> 30:17.382
Things like this happen
at the beginning, don't they?

30:17.448 --> 30:21.386
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Me and Ricci have never argued.

30:21.452 --> 30:24.389
Go and make the fucking phone call,
will you?

30:26.991 --> 30:27.992
I love you.

30:38.269 --> 30:40.905
"Hello?" Hiya, Scott.
"Hello. You all right?"

30:40.972 --> 30:45.843
Erm, Scott,
I think we need to talk about things.

30:45.910 --> 30:48.746
"Do you wanna be with us?"
I'm not gonna finish you.

30:48.813 --> 30:51.482
I just want to talk to you.
"Right. Yeah, OK."

30:51.549 --> 30:53.518
You're being so paranoid.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.086
"I miss you."

30:55.153 --> 30:58.022
I missed you a little bit as well.
"Have you?"

30:58.089 --> 31:00.658
Do you want to see us
one day next week?

31:00.725 --> 31:02.093
"Of course I do."

31:02.160 --> 31:04.462
I can't tell him over the phone.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.265
I couldn't do that.
I need to tell him face to face.

31:13.104 --> 31:16.541
This is going to be the first time
Holly has ever been on a date.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.209
What the fuck do I talk about?

31:18.276 --> 31:20.878
I'm better at blowjobs
than I am with words.

31:20.945 --> 31:22.247
We go to a pub quiz.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.716
For what is Comsat an abbreviation?

31:26.251 --> 31:28.052
Russia. Thick as fuck.

31:29.053 --> 31:31.923
Sophie's skulked off to bed
without any apology.

31:33.358 --> 31:35.526
Fat, washed-up,
useless fucking bitch.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.129
When is this going to end?

31:38.196 --> 31:40.632
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:53.144 --> 31:54.479
(phone rings)

31:55.747 --> 31:56.814
Hello?

31:56.881 --> 32:00.485
It's Dan from the party and I'm like,
"What the fuck do you want?"

32:00.551 --> 32:03.388
"I was wondering if you wanted
to go for a drink."

32:03.454 --> 32:05.556
What, like on a date?

32:06.591 --> 32:07.859
"Of course on a date."

32:07.925 --> 32:10.928
So, Dan from the party
has asked me out on a date.

32:10.995 --> 32:13.965
I'm like, what the fuck?
I've never been out on a date.

32:14.032 --> 32:16.167
Okie dokie. I'll see you soon.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.970
"Have a nice day. See you."
And you. Bye!

32:23.775 --> 32:26.944
I've planned a day trip
just to cheer everyone up.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.881
I just hope to God
it's nothing to do with the gym,

32:29.947 --> 32:32.483
eating healthy or what they do best.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.085
Sucking each other off.

32:35.153 --> 32:37.255
I've never been on a date.

32:37.322 --> 32:40.992
All it is, is the thing people
normally do before they have sex.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.128
You know what we're doing?

32:44.195 --> 32:46.197
No. What are we doing?
Segways.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.866
Them mad two wheel things.
I can't ride a bike!

32:48.933 --> 32:51.803
Why do you do this to me?
No, I bet you enjoy it.

32:51.869 --> 32:54.339
She will go arse over tit here.

32:54.405 --> 32:56.641
So we get there, and it's Segways.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.210
I'm like, "This could be all right."

33:01.412 --> 33:04.082
I've got an odd glove.

33:04.148 --> 33:06.884
Look at Holly's fucking tits!

33:10.388 --> 33:14.125
Things are feeling really,
really awkward

33:14.192 --> 33:15.827
between me, Ricci and Vicky.

33:15.893 --> 33:20.398
This is going to be
the longest day of my life.

33:30.875 --> 33:35.012
It's just like a hoover that
you stand on and move around on,

33:35.079 --> 33:36.614
but you don't clean up.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.850
I'd rather just poke meself.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.020
Segways are absolutely unreal.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.656
Like having wheels for feet.
I'm a natural.

33:45.723 --> 33:49.460
Segwaying's bent. That's
probably why James suggested it.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.964
Race time. We've got to go
round the track as quick as we can.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.565
(girls) Go on, Dan!

33:54.632 --> 33:58.469
Who can go round the fastest and
I'm trying to give it massive balls.

34:00.838 --> 34:01.839
(shouting)

34:01.906 --> 34:05.009
Shit! Nightmare.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.845
Trying to impress the lads,
straight off.

34:07.912 --> 34:10.648
He's shit, just like he is
at pulling girls.

34:15.319 --> 34:18.922
The day is just going on
and I'm feeling more awkward.

34:18.989 --> 34:22.493
Me and Vicky not speaking is
gonna cause an atmosphere,

34:22.560 --> 34:25.663
so I'm just gonna show remorse
and say, "I'm sorry."

34:25.730 --> 34:27.899
Vicky, I need to talk to you.

34:27.965 --> 34:30.368
I know you're gonna just walk away,
but...

34:30.435 --> 34:32.203
What do you want to say, Sophie?

34:32.270 --> 34:36.541
I just wanna say I apologise
for the way I reacted to you.

34:36.607 --> 34:39.976
I just feel, for the sake
of everyone else, just drop it.

34:40.043 --> 34:42.045
I know you hold grudges, man.

34:42.112 --> 34:44.382
I don't accept it.
You're an arsehole.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.784
Stay out of each other's way.
That's fine.

34:46.851 --> 34:49.687
Just stay out of each other's way.
OK, that's fine.

34:52.089 --> 34:56.260
To be honest, I was expecting
an apology from her at some point,

34:56.327 --> 35:00.932
but this pitiful, disgusting excuse
for an apology is an insult to me.

35:00.998 --> 35:03.167
You're a fucking joke.

35:05.703 --> 35:08.439
Well, that went perfectly.

35:11.042 --> 35:14.946
Most importantly, I got the fastest
time out of everyone on the day.

35:15.012 --> 35:17.615
Fucking buzzing. I beat everyone.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.654
Let's go, Gaz. Fucking let's go.
Come on.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.397
(Scott) Where you gonna take him?

35:33.464 --> 35:37.001
Holly's perfect date would
be McDonald's drive-thru in a Corsa.

35:37.068 --> 35:39.737
And then a blowjob!
And a gear stick.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.540
I've never been on a date before.

35:42.607 --> 35:46.444
I never took Holly on a first date.
We just went straight to the third.

35:46.511 --> 35:48.980
Holly's gonna go
on her first date tonight.

35:49.046 --> 35:51.349
I would love to be
a fly on the wall.

35:51.415 --> 35:54.919
I'll be fine. I'll just talk
about cocks if worst comes to worst.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.120
Her idea of chivalry

35:56.187 --> 35:59.123
is someone saying thank you
after she sucks them off.

35:59.190 --> 36:03.828
Normally, on first dates,
suitable topics of conversations...

36:03.895 --> 36:05.429
The weather?
Well...

36:05.496 --> 36:07.932
If you want to sound
like a weather man, yeah,

36:07.999 --> 36:10.134
but we normally try backgrounds.

36:10.201 --> 36:12.904
OK.
Hobbies, interests. Right.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.406
I've never done this.
I don't know how to act.

36:15.473 --> 36:16.941
I don't know what to say.

36:17.008 --> 36:20.811
Please don't lead with your whole,
"I've got GCSEs" comment,

36:20.878 --> 36:24.949
because just quite frankly
it's not an opener.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.984
I've got loads of GCSEs.

36:27.051 --> 36:29.720
I've got, like, five.
I'm proud of that.

36:29.787 --> 36:30.988
I honestly do hope

36:31.055 --> 36:35.126
that tonight's date
takes Holly's mind off James a bit.

36:35.192 --> 36:37.428
It's time
she went out with someone

36:37.495 --> 36:40.298
who has interest
in something other than a vagina.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.999
Bye, guys!

36:42.066 --> 36:44.168
You look lovely.
Thank you!

36:57.081 --> 37:00.384
We're going for a chilled approach.
We're going to a quiz.

37:00.451 --> 37:02.887
(Charlotte) I'm hoping
I get put with Vicky,

37:02.954 --> 37:05.122
cos she's got degrees and stuff.

37:05.189 --> 37:08.025
I'm least hoping
I'm gonna get put with James

37:08.092 --> 37:10.895
cos he's fucking thick as fuck.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.199
We separated two teams.

37:15.266 --> 37:18.970
Me, Vicky, Gaz, who knows
everything about bucking birds,

37:19.036 --> 37:22.206
and Dan the two-can man,
who's fucking gonna be useless.

37:22.273 --> 37:23.641
In which religion

37:23.708 --> 37:27.078
is the aim to break the chain
of karma

37:27.144 --> 37:29.080
by achieving nirvana?

37:30.448 --> 37:33.384
I don't think our specialist subjects
are on the quiz.

37:33.451 --> 37:37.521
For example, Gaz, he doesn't think
about anything other than bucking.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.790
So he knows fuck all about anything.

37:41.025 --> 37:43.728
I can win something, not quizzes.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.505
So then it hits me.

37:54.572 --> 37:56.707
I'm actually going on a date.

37:56.774 --> 37:59.677
I've never actually used this word
before in my life.

38:06.684 --> 38:10.488
Right now I'm panicking, thinking,
"What the fuck do I talk about?"

38:10.554 --> 38:13.324
I can't just start sucking him off.

38:13.391 --> 38:15.626
I'm better at blowjobs
than with words.

38:15.693 --> 38:18.763
Can I just have the...
Can I have potato skins, please?

38:18.829 --> 38:22.800
Why are you trying to order first?
Let me order first. I'm the lady.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.269
Nah, yeah.
I didn't want you to copy off us.

38:25.336 --> 38:27.705
(laughs)

38:27.772 --> 38:29.373
Normally, I would go out

38:29.440 --> 38:32.810
with the intention of just kind of,
like, banging someone,

38:32.877 --> 38:34.779
but this time, it's kind of like,

38:34.845 --> 38:37.148
I want to go on the date
and see how it goes.

38:37.214 --> 38:40.184
On a scale of one to two,
I'd definitely give you a one.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.719
One to two?

38:43.688 --> 38:48.426
Technology.
For what is Comsat an abbreviation?

38:52.563 --> 38:55.466
Fuck. I think
we've walked into the wrong quiz.

38:55.533 --> 38:59.003
There's not a single person here
below the age of 70.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.106
How on earth are we meant
to get questions right

39:02.173 --> 39:04.642
what are meant
for people nearly dead?

39:07.144 --> 39:08.612
Right, question 28.

39:11.682 --> 39:15.653
So, I'm mortal, I'm nervous and
I'm running out of things to say.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.688
There's only one thing left to do.

39:22.993 --> 39:25.930
So, I'm kissing him
and I'm still kissing him.

39:25.996 --> 39:27.932
And actually, it's not that bad.

39:29.133 --> 39:32.636
Which 4,000 mile-long train route

39:32.703 --> 39:35.506
connected China
with the Mediterranean?

39:35.573 --> 39:36.607
Russia.

39:36.674 --> 39:39.443
Charlotte's even worse
than I thought she'd be.

39:39.510 --> 39:42.646
Every single question,
she thinks the answer is Russia.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.048
What was 28?

39:44.115 --> 39:46.984
Russia.
(laughs)

39:47.051 --> 39:51.422
Russia is the best continent
in the whole of the planet.

39:51.489 --> 39:52.690
It has everything.

39:52.757 --> 39:56.060
It has the Soviet Union.
We didn't have one of them.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.562
It has long, grey, fluffy hats.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.264
We don't have any of them.

40:00.331 --> 40:02.099
It has clogs.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.635
James. (speaks fake Russian)

40:06.003 --> 40:07.705
Shall we go somewhere else?

40:07.772 --> 40:09.340
Shall we go somewhere else?

40:09.406 --> 40:11.575
We leave the quiz,
cos we're shit at it.

40:11.642 --> 40:15.579
Off to a bar. Few cocktails. Chill
out. Hopefully there'll be birds

40:15.646 --> 40:17.648
and I can get back to my subject.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.359
This is, like, the first ever date
I've ever been on.

40:30.828 --> 40:33.297
Same. (laughs)

40:33.364 --> 40:36.066
You're lying.
No, honestly.

40:36.133 --> 40:39.770
I'm so proud you've took
me dating virginity.

40:39.837 --> 40:40.971
You took mine, too.

40:41.038 --> 40:43.240
Exactly, so we took each other's.

40:43.307 --> 40:45.042
That's quite good, I suppose.

40:45.109 --> 40:48.846
I'm genuinely shocked,
because the date was a success.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.148
Dan's actually a really nice guy.

40:51.215 --> 40:53.851
Perfect person
to lose my dating virginity too.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.252
To Holly's date.

40:55.319 --> 40:56.754
Holly's date!

41:00.424 --> 41:01.725
(all cheer)

41:01.792 --> 41:02.827
Holly!

41:02.893 --> 41:05.262
Where is he?
Where's your man?

41:05.329 --> 41:06.530
We're having drinks

41:06.597 --> 41:10.134
and Holly walks in with this massive
beaming smile on her face.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.769
She can't walk straight.

41:11.836 --> 41:14.572
Did you buck him or not?
No. We kissed, though.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.574
(all cheer)

41:16.640 --> 41:19.677
She's actually been out for drinks
and socialised

41:19.743 --> 41:22.613
and interacted
with another human being.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.082
It's a step in the right direction.

41:26.283 --> 41:28.385
(James) In come a flood of girls.

41:28.452 --> 41:31.422
Shock, Scott and Gaz
are straight on it.

41:31.488 --> 41:33.357
Like a tramp on fucking chips.

41:34.725 --> 41:37.461
Tonight is supposed to be
about Holly

41:37.528 --> 41:40.564
and the lads are
up to old tricks again.

41:40.631 --> 41:43.167
Sniffing around
all the girls' fairies.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.668
Hi. What's your name?

41:48.772 --> 41:52.209
It's almost now been a week
since I've banged. What's going on?

41:52.276 --> 41:54.311
So before I get pied, I'm off.

41:55.813 --> 42:01.285
The Buck Squad haven't pulled
all weekend. (laughs)

42:10.928 --> 42:13.364
What's in that other one?
Is it chicken?

42:13.430 --> 42:16.000
No, there's no chicken left.

42:17.234 --> 42:20.537
Sophie skulked off to bed
like a fucking little rodent

42:20.604 --> 42:22.039
without any apology to me.

42:22.106 --> 42:24.341
I'm hardly surprised,
but I'm foaming.

42:24.408 --> 42:27.211
What an absolute tosser
she's shown herself to be.

42:28.212 --> 42:31.382
Sophie causes every single argument
in this house!

42:31.448 --> 42:34.685
Because she's a cheating slag.
I know. Why the fuck...

42:34.752 --> 42:35.986
This is bullshit.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.689
Vicky and Ricci are going mental

42:38.756 --> 42:41.959
and this is because
Sophie didn't apologise properly.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.630
When is this going to end?

42:49.667 --> 42:52.002
Fat, washed-up,
useless fucking bitch.

42:52.069 --> 42:54.405
It's been a while
since I spoke to Scott.

42:54.471 --> 42:56.206
I need to tell him what happened.

42:57.675 --> 43:01.145
I wanna be there, but I'm not
because of the stupid argument.

43:01.211 --> 43:02.880
(hums Wedding March)

43:02.947 --> 43:04.048
(all cheer)

43:04.114 --> 43:08.919
I haven't got a care in the world.
The girl who James fancies walks in.

43:08.986 --> 43:12.723
I thought I would be OK with it,
but I'm not.

43:13.624 --> 43:15.459
Me and Vicky just need to make up.

43:15.526 --> 43:18.028
Please, man.
You fucking tit.

43:20.030 --> 43:22.333
How long will it last?

43:22.399 --> 43:24.401
