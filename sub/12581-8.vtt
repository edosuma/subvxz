Today we'll be discussing
A Tale of Two Cities

00:36.328 --> 00:37.386
a terrific book

00:37.430 --> 00:41.230
by that most Dickensian
of authors, Charles Dickens.

00:41.267 --> 00:42.564
Okay, you've all read it.

00:42.601 --> 00:44.569
Come on, let's get
a dialogue going.

00:44.603 --> 00:47.436
Um, I really liked
the guillotine.

00:47.473 --> 00:48.565
Yes, yes.

00:48.607 --> 00:51.235
Um, why don't they have
the guillotine here?

00:51.277 --> 00:53.802
Well, I don't know,
but the theme...

00:53.846 --> 00:56.747
BOY 2:
Did anyone ever
try to pull

00:56.782 --> 01:00.445
their head out of the guillotine
at the last minute

01:00.486 --> 01:04.479
so, like, just the top
of their head got chopped off?

01:04.522 --> 01:07.788
Okay, are there any questions
not involving the guillotine?

01:07.827 --> 01:08.794
Anyone?

01:08.828 --> 01:09.795
Anything?

01:09.829 --> 01:10.796
So that's it?

01:10.830 --> 01:11.797
What about class differences?

01:11.831 --> 01:13.423
What about romantic love?

01:13.466 --> 01:15.331
Sacrifice and regret?

01:15.367 --> 01:18.495
Everything in life is between
the covers of this book, people.

01:20.940 --> 01:22.908
You went crazy.

01:24.910 --> 01:30.815
(bell ringing)

01:33.085 --> 01:34.552
My husband likes his stories.

01:34.587 --> 01:35.952
WOMAN 2:
People say he was

01:35.988 --> 01:37.080
a poor man's Hemingway

01:37.122 --> 01:39.249
but I think Hemingway
was a poor man's Hemingway.

01:39.291 --> 01:40.258
(chuckling)

01:40.292 --> 01:43.784
"Poor man's Hemingway."

01:43.829 --> 01:45.797
Uh, can I help you
find something?

01:45.831 --> 01:46.798
Well, yes.

01:46.832 --> 01:48.800
I am looking to replace
my well-worn

01:48.834 --> 01:51.132
and fully understood copy
of A Tale of Two Cities

01:51.170 --> 01:52.467
by Charles...
Dickens.

01:52.505 --> 01:55.838
Of course. It's in Classics
to your left.

01:55.875 --> 01:57.866
Anyway, I hope
tonight's discussion

01:57.910 --> 02:00.140
will be as spirited
as the last one.

02:00.179 --> 02:02.147
You bring the opinions,
I'll bring the Merlot

02:02.181 --> 02:03.307
and I'm sure
it will be.

02:03.349 --> 02:06.113
Merlot?
Well, excuse me.

02:06.151 --> 02:08.381
You must be talking
about a book club.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.387
We are.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.945
A bientot.

02:10.990 --> 02:11.957
Pardon
my French.

02:11.991 --> 02:13.856
Oh, es de nada.

02:13.893 --> 02:16.657
And my Spanish
needs no apologies.

02:16.695 --> 02:18.856
You know, as one intellectual
to another.

02:18.898 --> 02:19.865
I must say

02:19.899 --> 02:21.924
your book club
sounds fun.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.094
And I do happen
to be free tonight.

02:24.136 --> 02:25.103
You're not free.

02:25.137 --> 02:26.434
You have a date
with Dickens.

02:26.472 --> 02:27.666
That'll be $5.95.

02:30.543 --> 02:31.532
Yup.

02:32.545 --> 02:33.204
Yup.

02:33.579 --> 02:35.547
Oh, mind
if I join you?

02:35.681 --> 02:36.648
I'm kind of in the mood

02:36.682 --> 02:38.650
for some stimulating
conversation.

02:38.684 --> 02:40.208
You've come
to the right place.

02:40.252 --> 02:44.382
Now, Bill, you were opining
on a matter of some import.

02:44.423 --> 02:45.390
Oh, yeah.

02:45.424 --> 02:48.393
Why is it I like butter
but I don't like cheese?

02:48.427 --> 02:49.951
They're both yellow.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.223
Is it the texture?

02:51.263 --> 02:53.231
You do too
like cheese, Bill.

02:53.265 --> 02:54.323
I've seen you eat it.

02:54.366 --> 02:55.628
No, I don't.

02:55.668 --> 02:57.363
Remember A Tale
of Two Cities?

02:57.403 --> 02:58.370
Dickens?

02:58.404 --> 03:00.429
Well, I'm in the middle
of rereading it and it...

03:00.472 --> 03:02.440
Peggy, you've
seen Bill eat cheese.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.442
Why won't you
take my word for this?

03:04.476 --> 03:06.273
Cream cheese
is cheese, Bill.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.008
No, it's not.
It's butter.

03:09.048 --> 03:11.642
(sighs)

03:11.684 --> 03:13.345
And if I'm
in your book club

03:13.385 --> 03:14.409
I can assure you

03:14.453 --> 03:16.421
you'll never have
to worry about

03:16.455 --> 03:17.422
long awkward pauses.

03:17.456 --> 03:21.017
Well, what do you think?

03:21.060 --> 03:25.588
If it were up to me,
I'd... think about it.

03:25.631 --> 03:26.893
But they only invite me

03:26.932 --> 03:29.093
because I give them
a discount on their books.

03:29.134 --> 03:31.602
And I'm closing the store
soon to retire anyway.

03:31.637 --> 03:32.865
My lease is up.

03:32.905 --> 03:33.963
Retiring?

03:34.006 --> 03:36.406
Everybody keeps saying,
"Leave Arlen?"

03:36.442 --> 03:37.932
But I've always
wanted to spend

03:37.977 --> 03:40.377
my later years someplace
where it's nice and cold

03:40.412 --> 03:41.504
all year round.

03:41.547 --> 03:44.107
HANK:
$600 a month for five years?

03:44.149 --> 03:45.241
I don't know.

03:45.284 --> 03:46.751
Hank, I really need

03:46.785 --> 03:49.379
to be around people
who love books.

03:49.421 --> 03:54.290
I will do all the work
all you have to do is cosign

03:54.326 --> 03:57.295
as you are the one
with an income

03:57.329 --> 03:59.923
and the house
is in your name.

03:59.965 --> 04:01.057
Oh, please, Hank.

04:01.100 --> 04:04.433
I will be raking in
money with one hand

04:04.470 --> 04:08.566
and reading my book for
the book club with the other.

04:08.607 --> 04:09.574
Oh, Hank!

04:09.608 --> 04:10.939
LAURA:
My sacred mission

04:10.976 --> 04:12.944
to bring literature
to Arlen is now yours.

04:12.978 --> 04:14.206
Oh, wait, wait.

04:14.246 --> 04:16.043
One last thing.

04:16.081 --> 04:19.050
When do I start
to attend the book club?

04:19.084 --> 04:21.745
Oh, well, the next meeting
isn't for a couple of weeks.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.186
I'm sure they'll stop by.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.553
The best of luck
to you, dear.

04:24.590 --> 04:30.495
Okay, this is it.

04:33.332 --> 04:34.299
Show time.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.393
Show time.

04:37.436 --> 04:40.530
(bell ringing)

04:40.572 --> 04:43.063
HANK:
Hello there, ma'am.

04:43.108 --> 04:46.976
We're here to support our local
bookseller and buy some books.

04:47.012 --> 04:49.207
Well, thank you,
handsome patron.

04:49.248 --> 04:52.376
Bobby, why don't you go look
in the adventure section.

04:52.418 --> 04:58.789
Anything about a boy with
gumption should be fine.

05:04.630 --> 05:07.360
"Clea,
Huntress of Dragonvale.

05:07.399 --> 05:11.768
Part the Fifth of
the Elves of Evermore Series."

05:11.804 --> 05:13.533
Huh.

05:21.146 --> 05:23.740
MAN:
You're listening to Peru Today

05:23.782 --> 05:30.381
on listener supported
public radio.

05:30.422 --> 05:34.324
(incomprehensible rapping)

05:37.162 --> 05:38.322
So, how's the...

05:38.363 --> 05:39.557
Fantastic.

05:39.598 --> 05:41.793
Best decision I ever
made in my life.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.927
Good night, Hank.

05:46.905 --> 05:48.634
(bell ringing)

05:48.674 --> 05:51.165
Oh, Dale.

05:51.210 --> 05:53.235
So this
is a book store.

05:53.278 --> 05:56.042
Smells boring.

05:56.081 --> 05:59.073
Mm, have you thought about
putting saw dust on the floor?

05:59.118 --> 05:59.777
I'm getting apple
everywhere.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.513
I'm sorry, Dale

06:01.553 --> 06:04.317
but this store is reserved
for customers and literati.

06:04.356 --> 06:06.517
So, why don't you
take your apple...

06:06.558 --> 06:07.525
It's a Braeburn.

06:07.559 --> 06:08.685
...and get out?

06:08.727 --> 06:09.694
Okay. Wait.

06:09.728 --> 06:13.061
I am a customer.

06:13.098 --> 06:19.128
I'd like your
thickest book, please.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.968
(humming)

06:21.006 --> 06:21.973
Here's The Odsse.

06:22.007 --> 06:24.237
It's thick, it's old,
it's Greek.

06:24.276 --> 06:25.368
This looks promising.

06:31.416 --> 06:33.350
Nih, nih, nih.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.050
What the hell
are you doing?

06:35.154 --> 06:36.746
I can't hide
a gun inside it

06:36.855 --> 06:38.447
without
hollowing it out.

06:38.524 --> 06:40.355
Unless you have
some precuts?

06:40.559 --> 06:41.924
(bell ringing)

06:41.960 --> 06:43.018
Pardon me, ma'am
but can you

06:43.061 --> 06:45.029
give me four quarters
for a dollar?

06:45.063 --> 06:46.087
No, I'm sorry. I have a sign.

06:46.131 --> 06:51.728
Hey, how much
for the 1911-A-1?

06:51.770 --> 06:55.103
This baby is yours
for, oh...

06:55.140 --> 06:56.368
300 dollars American.

06:56.441 --> 06:57.772
Sold.

07:02.748 --> 07:05.649
Dale, you cannot sell
a firearm in my bookstore.

07:05.684 --> 07:06.776
I know, I know.

07:06.819 --> 07:08.218
You want your house cut.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.118
20% to the madame.

07:10.155 --> 07:12.123
Madame, $60.00.

07:16.328 --> 07:17.955
In theory,
I reject this money.

07:17.996 --> 07:21.227
It is only in practice
that I accept it.

07:21.266 --> 07:24.133
You know, this is a perfect
gun selling location.

07:24.169 --> 07:25.136
So, how 'bout it,
Peggy?

07:25.170 --> 07:27.138
Can I sell guns
in this location?

07:27.172 --> 07:30.039
I've got literally
oodles of guns at home...

07:30.075 --> 07:35.638
Thank you for shopping
at Peggy's World of Books.

07:41.253 --> 07:46.850
Oh, thank you so much
for eating my free cookies.

07:46.892 --> 07:47.916
Hello, I just
came by to see...

07:47.960 --> 07:50.053
Laura, thank goodness
you're here.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.791
I have only made one sale
in the past three days

07:52.831 --> 07:54.526
and that was just
a greeting card.

07:54.566 --> 07:56.932
Peggy, this has never been
a high-volume business.

07:56.969 --> 07:58.527
But the lease,
I mean, how did you...

07:58.570 --> 08:00.697
Oh, the executor
of my parents' estate

08:00.739 --> 08:02.206
sent a check every month

08:02.241 --> 08:03.731
interest from
some such account.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.764
I never quite
followed it.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.004
But you shouldn't

08:06.044 --> 08:07.511
concern yourself
with that.

08:07.546 --> 08:10.242
We worship the written word,
not the almighty dollar, yes?

08:10.282 --> 08:12.216
Oh, well, yes, of course.

08:12.251 --> 08:13.183
And worse comes to worst

08:13.218 --> 08:15.880
you just get your husband
to write a check, right?

08:15.921 --> 08:19.755
I'm taking
one of the Joyces.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.952
(bell ringing)

08:48.754 --> 08:52.588
Good morning.

08:52.624 --> 08:53.989
Word to the wise,
we have

08:54.026 --> 08:56.187
a new collection of
Barbara Kingsolver's stories

08:56.228 --> 08:58.196
that is her best in years.

09:00.532 --> 09:01.556
Guns, I suppose.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.692
Yes, ma'am.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.395
Straight in back.

09:04.436 --> 09:06.597
You know, we have
a book called Old Yeller.

09:06.638 --> 09:08.765
It's about a boy
who shoots a dog.

09:08.807 --> 09:10.104
With a gun.

09:10.142 --> 09:11.404
Welcome, gentlemen.

09:11.443 --> 09:13.968
The Tuesday special
is Saturday Night specials.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.843
Feel free to browse.

09:15.881 --> 09:17.974
Uh, here at the Book and Gun

09:18.016 --> 09:19.984
we're trying to maintain
a certain...

09:20.018 --> 09:22.248
What do you call it,
Peggy?!

09:22.287 --> 09:23.254
Ambiance.

09:23.288 --> 09:25.153
Right. Ambiance.

09:25.190 --> 09:29.092
So we're having
cappuccino.

09:29.127 --> 09:30.754
That's like coffee, right?

09:30.796 --> 09:31.763
I don't know.

09:31.797 --> 09:34.391
Oh, and if some well-dressed
ladies come in

09:34.433 --> 09:36.401
you’re just here
to move a piano.

09:36.435 --> 09:38.767
What you reading there, son?

09:38.804 --> 09:40.032
Sports page.

09:40.072 --> 09:41.937
The sports page.

09:41.974 --> 09:44.442
Well, all right, Bobby.

09:44.476 --> 09:46.171
How's the Cowboy's defense...

09:46.211 --> 09:48.179
You know, same ol', same ol'.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.180
Ooh!

09:49.214 --> 09:50.181
Clea, Huntress of...

09:50.215 --> 09:55.084
I told you to get
an adventure book.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.748
But it is adventure.

09:57.789 --> 10:02.317
"The Elf-Lord Fylfendell knelt
upon the bed of dandelions.

10:02.361 --> 10:06.457
"'Young wanderer,'
quoth he, 'I have woven you

10:06.498 --> 10:07.487
a magic breastplate..."'

10:07.532 --> 10:09.898
(groans)

10:09.935 --> 10:12.369
Bobby, television.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.838
MAN:
Uh...

10:14.873 --> 10:22.279
I'm going
to go with, uh...

10:22.314 --> 10:23.508
gun.

10:23.548 --> 10:24.742
Gih!

10:24.783 --> 10:27.251
Morning, officer.

10:27.285 --> 10:30.254
OFFICER:
Do you have a license
to sell guns, sir?

10:30.288 --> 10:33.416
What I sell is a lifestyle.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.720
A life style free from...

10:34.760 --> 10:35.727
Books!

10:35.761 --> 10:36.989
We sell
books here.

10:37.029 --> 10:40.624
The guns are simply
a promotional give-away.

10:40.665 --> 10:42.530
Yeah.

10:42.567 --> 10:45.934
Okay, as long as everybody
leaves this store with a book.

10:45.971 --> 10:48.940
Let me show you the stylish
nine millimeter Luger

10:48.974 --> 10:50.236
that comes free with any

10:50.275 --> 10:54.473
$600 purchase of quality
science-fiction.

11:00.152 --> 11:02.586
Dale, Glock.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.146
Oh, I been looking
for this little girl.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.385
(gunshot)
(gasping)

11:07.426 --> 11:09.792
Sometimes the boys like
to go down in the basement

11:09.828 --> 11:11.159
and test their piece.

11:11.196 --> 11:13.858
But don’t worry,
I shut off the gas valve.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.764
Well, shot off
the gas valve.

11:15.801 --> 11:20.568
Oh, my God...

11:20.605 --> 11:22.300
it's the freakin' book club!

11:22.340 --> 11:24.308
You get your skinny butt
down to the basement

11:24.342 --> 11:25.366
and pass out the silencers.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.640
Peggy, hello.

11:27.679 --> 11:32.378
It certainly is an...

11:32.417 --> 11:33.611
interesting
atmosphere

11:33.652 --> 11:35.279
you've cultivated.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.619
So, the sign says
you're selling guns now?

11:38.657 --> 11:39.817
Oh, the sign.

11:39.858 --> 11:41.382
That old thing.

11:41.426 --> 11:44.520
You know, the "T" fell off.

11:44.563 --> 11:47.726
It's really
supposed to say "gunst."

11:47.766 --> 11:49.734
Surely you didn't
come here today

11:49.768 --> 11:50.735
for, for gunst.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.236
Enjoy. Good reading.

11:52.270 --> 11:55.068
Yes, well,
these good people are here

11:55.107 --> 11:57.803
from a historical
reenactment club.

11:57.843 --> 12:03.804
Today we are doing "America
in the Time of Whitman."

12:03.849 --> 12:04.907
(gunshots)

12:04.950 --> 12:06.713
What was that?

12:06.751 --> 12:09.015
Merely the anvil
of the village smithy.

12:09.054 --> 12:10.749
Making horseshoes, no doubt.

12:10.789 --> 12:12.279
(rapid-fire gunshots)

12:12.324 --> 12:15.259
Yes, well, we've come to
place our monthly order

12:15.293 --> 12:18.091
for the book club selection
A Dinner of Onions, by...

12:18.130 --> 12:20.098
Nora Harmony Wallace, of course.

12:20.132 --> 12:24.466
A chronicle of three generations
of an American family.

12:24.503 --> 12:27.063
I always wondered why nobody's
ever done that before.

12:27.105 --> 12:31.303
Uh, do you have any peroxide
and a clean towel?

12:31.343 --> 12:32.708
I just shot my dang hand.

12:32.744 --> 12:35.076
Oh, well, oh, okay.

12:35.113 --> 12:38.674
The, uh, Confederate doctors
will be here shortly

12:38.717 --> 12:41.117
to give you ether
and saw off your arm.

12:41.153 --> 12:43.644
Actors.

12:43.688 --> 12:45.918
Say, why don't
you come to the
meeting yourself?

12:45.957 --> 12:47.948
To the book club? Really?

12:47.993 --> 12:49.961
And bring your
husband if you like.

12:49.995 --> 12:51.292
The club is
mostly couples.

12:51.329 --> 12:53.729
(bell tinkling)

12:53.765 --> 12:54.732
Oh, yeah!

12:54.766 --> 12:58.725
Ankle holsters all
around on the house!

12:58.770 --> 13:01.705
(men whooping and hollering)

13:01.740 --> 13:02.968
All right!

13:03.008 --> 13:05.533
Hank, we are going
to the book club.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.010
Read this by Friday.

13:07.045 --> 13:08.012
You are excused

13:08.046 --> 13:09.013
from emptying
the garbage

13:09.047 --> 13:10.014
till this is done.

13:10.048 --> 13:11.015
And no TV.

13:11.049 --> 13:14.348
You won't let me read a book
that I want.

13:16.221 --> 13:18.951
Mom makes you read a book
that you don’t want.

13:19.524 --> 13:21.424
That's what the elves call

13:21.493 --> 13:23.961
"Justice of
the Unicorn."

13:26.565 --> 13:27.623
(heavy sigh)

13:27.699 --> 13:30.634
Turns out the first two chapters
were a dream.

13:30.869 --> 13:32.803
I'm not sure
I trust this lady.

13:33.038 --> 13:34.232
And what do you make of this?

13:34.372 --> 13:37.603
Every time she cooks dinner
for her father, she cries.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.467
But it's not always onions.

13:39.644 --> 13:41.271
Yeah, man, see, now,
my dang ol' father

13:41.379 --> 13:42.607
he gon' symbolize
the past, man

13:42.681 --> 13:45.206
and ol' dinnergon' be,
like, the future, you know?

13:45.283 --> 13:46.978
So, you're talkin'
'bout stuck in the
present, you know?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.020
Just like dang ol'
English class, man.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.678
I had onions
for dinner last night.

13:50.789 --> 13:53.189
You can get a pound
for 49 cents.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.989
"As the ambulance pulled away

13:58.063 --> 14:00.725
"Cassie remembered
the smell of onions

14:00.799 --> 14:02.528
from her grandmother’s kitchen."

14:03.201 --> 14:03.997
The End.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.103
Joe Jack, you awake?

14:06.204 --> 14:08.672
I got half a mind
to go to Nova Scotia

14:08.740 --> 14:11.174
and kick that Benedict's ass,
honey.

14:11.209 --> 14:13.677
Boy, that Cassie
reminds me of someone.

14:13.712 --> 14:18.740
Hey, how big did you guys
picture her ta-tas?

14:18.783 --> 14:24.517
It said she was slender as
a willow, so... grapefruits?

14:24.556 --> 14:25.523
Come on, let's go.

14:25.557 --> 14:27.525
If we stay in the
truck too long

14:27.559 --> 14:29.459
people are going to
think we're making out.

14:29.494 --> 14:33.590
All right, Kafka, Kafka...
born 1883, wore glasses

14:33.632 --> 14:36.362
burdened by father,
loved to sleep in.

14:36.401 --> 14:39.837
Yes! Peggy,
you are ready.

14:39.871 --> 14:45.605
Now, if I tug my earlobe
like this

14:45.644 --> 14:47.805
just casually say
that you understood

14:47.846 --> 14:49.814
what the author
was going for, but...

14:49.848 --> 14:54.342
Then just trail off
like that.

14:54.386 --> 14:57.321
I told him,
"Mister, you may be on retainer

14:57.355 --> 14:59.823
"but if you retain your hand
on my thigh like that

14:59.858 --> 15:02.156
I will bite it off
and bill you for my time."

15:02.193 --> 15:03.160
Mm-hmm.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.162
That is exactly
like the scene at dinner

15:05.196 --> 15:07.494
where Cassie confronts
the hotel manager, yes?

15:07.532 --> 15:09.796
Honey, I couldn't get past
Chapter Three.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.802
That writer
was trying way to hard

15:11.836 --> 15:13.963
to be Isabel Allende
for my blood.

15:14.005 --> 15:15.734
Great reference.

15:15.774 --> 15:20.336
Isabel Allende,
Chilean authoress born 1942.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.936
My source... the Internet.

15:21.980 --> 15:29.443
So, you say it's both efficient
and clean burning?

15:29.487 --> 15:30.454
Fascinating.

15:30.488 --> 15:32.080
Oh, Hank,
there you are.

15:32.123 --> 15:34.148
I was just wondering
if you men had noticed

15:34.192 --> 15:36.217
the subtle change
of perspective
in Book Two

15:36.261 --> 15:37.489
the way the
women have.

15:37.529 --> 15:40.930
Book... Two.

15:40.965 --> 15:43.593
Uh, fellas, this
is my wife, Peggy.

15:43.635 --> 15:44.795
Delighted
to meet you.

15:44.836 --> 15:50.274
Is... is your ear all right,
Mrs. Hill?

15:50.308 --> 15:53.641
I, uh, understood what
the author was going for.

15:53.678 --> 15:57.705
Uh... in the book, there.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.808
(clearing throat)

15:59.851 --> 16:02.820
So, Mary Ellen, we had
just a marvelous time.

16:02.854 --> 16:05.186
I cannot wait to see
you at the next meeting.

16:05.223 --> 16:07.157
I was going to
suggest we read

16:07.192 --> 16:11.356
The Dust Gatherers
by Nobel laureate Mkozi Mputha.

16:11.396 --> 16:12.727
Well, actually...

16:12.764 --> 16:13.856
(clearing throat)

16:13.898 --> 16:17.800
I'm afraid this
is the very last
book club meeting.

16:17.836 --> 16:19.428
Scheduling nightmare,
you know.

16:19.471 --> 16:21.098
The last meeting?

16:21.139 --> 16:22.106
No, no!

16:22.140 --> 16:23.107
We can't let
this die.

16:23.141 --> 16:24.233
Why, I could
drive everyone.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.401
Where does
everyone live?

16:25.443 --> 16:26.876
I'm sorry, Peggy.

16:26.911 --> 16:29.277
But I'm so glad
you were able to come

16:29.314 --> 16:32.340
for the final, final,
last meeting.

16:32.384 --> 16:33.351
(groaning)

16:33.385 --> 16:34.784
I can't believe it.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.787
What am I going to do
with my weekends now?

16:36.821 --> 16:39.483
Except watch sports.

16:39.524 --> 16:41.492
Oh, well. Peggy?

16:43.094 --> 16:44.061
Hold on, Hank.

16:44.095 --> 16:46.063
I need to use
their powder room.

16:46.097 --> 16:49.066
Maybe it's the ten
cups of coffee I drank
to stay sharp for this.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.067
I'll get the truck.

16:50.101 --> 16:56.062
Oh... The New Yorker.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.133
I guess it's my fault.

17:00.178 --> 17:01.873
She gave us
such a big discount

17:01.913 --> 17:03.574
I felt
I had to invite her.

17:03.615 --> 17:07.744
Who knew she'd be
such a windbag?

17:10.789 --> 17:11.949
As Cassie said

17:11.990 --> 17:14.253
while the farmhouse
burned brightly behind her

17:14.291 --> 17:17.193
"I am an onion."

17:17.228 --> 17:20.560
Good day to you.

17:29.974 --> 17:41.044
(yelling)

17:41.085 --> 17:42.643
Surely as I am Clea

17:42.687 --> 17:46.123
and the Crystal of Gilmarrion
shines upon my brow

17:46.157 --> 17:50.150
our forces shall rally
and vanquish the Goblin horde.

17:50.195 --> 17:51.560
What say ye, Hindbottom?

17:51.596 --> 17:55.930
Aye, my fell axe thirsts
for Goblin blood

17:55.967 --> 17:58.663
to avenge my father Borak

17:58.703 --> 18:02.503
my swift brother
Rigmar Talon-beard, my cousin...

18:02.540 --> 18:04.804
HANK:
Dang it, Bobby.

18:04.843 --> 18:07.277
No more elves
at the table.

18:07.312 --> 18:10.839
Your mom
isn't feeling well, and...

18:10.882 --> 18:12.247
No, no, I'm fine.

18:12.283 --> 18:13.250
(horn honking)

18:13.284 --> 18:15.047
All right, Dale, I am coming!

18:15.086 --> 18:16.053
(sighing)

18:16.087 --> 18:17.145
Great... time for work.

18:17.188 --> 18:20.021
No rest for the windbag.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.257
Thank you.

18:23.294 --> 18:24.386
Please come again.

18:24.429 --> 18:26.260
Oh, I got that one
yesterday

18:26.297 --> 18:29.095
with my last gun.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.067
Oh, my God,
how many guns do you need?

18:31.102 --> 18:32.797
Thank you, come again.

18:32.837 --> 18:34.964
Peggy, would you
wipe the fingerprints off this

18:35.006 --> 18:37.065
and wrap it, please?

18:42.447 --> 18:45.348
I've come to take
the local bookseller to lunch.

18:45.383 --> 18:46.350
Heh... uh, Peggy?

18:46.384 --> 18:49.046
DALE:
Pull!

18:49.087 --> 18:51.078
(gunshots)

18:51.122 --> 18:54.216
What the hell?

18:54.259 --> 18:55.419
Peggy?

18:55.460 --> 18:56.688
(gunshots)

18:56.728 --> 18:57.695
Dad.

18:57.729 --> 18:59.788
Well, look who's here.

18:59.831 --> 19:02.299
Shopping for my birthday?

19:02.333 --> 19:07.270
Get me something
that shoots like this.

19:07.305 --> 19:08.499
(gunshots)

19:08.540 --> 19:09.507
Die!

19:09.541 --> 19:10.906
Excellent grouping, Colonel.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.570
Plus, those hollow-points
penetrated Shakespeare

19:13.611 --> 19:16.842
all the way into
the so-called "Joyous Comedies."

19:16.881 --> 19:18.508
As You Like Lt?

19:18.550 --> 19:20.142
Well, I like it plenty.

19:20.184 --> 19:22.584
Dang it, Dale,
where is my wife?

19:22.620 --> 19:25.088
Mmm, probably
on one of her smoking breaks.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.785
I try not to keep her
on too tight of a leash.

19:32.363 --> 19:33.330
Peggy?

19:33.364 --> 19:34.456
What are you
doing down there?

19:34.499 --> 19:35.830
Nothing.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.630
Seems to be my mission in life.

19:37.669 --> 19:40.399
No, your mission
was about books...

19:40.438 --> 19:42.235
elves and onions and such.

19:42.273 --> 19:43.365
Look at this.

19:43.408 --> 19:45.603
Now, I'm not much in the
Shakespeare department

19:45.643 --> 19:48.339
but I still don’t think
he deserves to be shot at

19:48.379 --> 19:50.108
by those monkeys down there.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.376
And A Tale
of Two Cities?

19:51.416 --> 19:56.183
I thought that was
your favorite book.

20:00.792 --> 20:06.253
And so, a farewell to
A Farewell to Arms.

20:06.297 --> 20:09.323
Dale, your services at
Peggy's World of Books

20:09.367 --> 20:11.358
are terminated
as of now.

20:11.402 --> 20:12.733
Get out.

20:12.770 --> 20:13.737
You can't do that.

20:13.771 --> 20:15.398
I can, and I will.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.930
My name is the
name on the lease.

20:16.975 --> 20:18.602
This is Peggy's World.

20:18.643 --> 20:21.806
You just rent
space in it.

20:26.985 --> 20:28.475
Here's the key to the Dumpster.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.749
If you don't lock it,
the winos sleep in it.

20:30.788 --> 20:32.016
They are not winos.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.650
They are my customers,
loyal customers.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.956
I'm looking for the lady
who ran the gun store.

20:36.995 --> 20:38.189
She's out of business.

20:38.229 --> 20:40.663
She's been referring
people to Ammo World

20:40.698 --> 20:42.097
or Crazy Jerry's.

20:42.133 --> 20:44.101
I just wanted to know
if the first two chapters

20:44.135 --> 20:46.000
were really a dream or not.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.834
Yeah, I wondered that myself.

20:55.513 --> 20:58.038
Travis makes an excellent point.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.482
Cassie's lighthouse
can symbolize hope

21:00.518 --> 21:03.544
but who’s to say
it doesn't also symbolize

21:03.588 --> 21:05.112
the government's intrusion

21:05.156 --> 21:07.124
into the lives
of private citizens

21:07.158 --> 21:08.750
as suggested by our friend here

21:08.793 --> 21:11.728
who won't give us
his name.

21:11.763 --> 21:15.164
Cassie's grandpa
wouldn’t give her
an evil lighthouse.

21:15.199 --> 21:17.497
Very good point, Muskrat.

21:17.535 --> 21:18.502
Any responses?

21:18.536 --> 21:20.026
Well, can’t we
at least agree

21:20.071 --> 21:23.472
that Mary-Elizabeth's baby
was her own lighthouse?

21:23.508 --> 21:25.999
Whoever heard of an
illegitimate lighthouse?

21:26.044 --> 21:28.410
Got-dang it, Ox,
you're confusing realism

21:28.446 --> 21:29.344
with symbolism again.

21:29.380 --> 21:32.008
MOUNTAIN MAN:
I'm about to symbolize
my gun to our head.
