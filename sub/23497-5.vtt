WEBVTT

00:10.510 --> 00:13.346
We should never
have children together, Lo.

00:13.430 --> 00:15.098
Oh, agreed.
What a nightmare!

00:15.724 --> 00:18.226
What does your mom think we're doing
while she's at her yoga retreat?

00:18.310 --> 00:21.313
Um, I told her you guys were coming over
to work on a project.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.607
The project of beautification.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.777
Okay, ladies, choose your color.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.362
Yes! Nachos!

00:29.446 --> 00:30.906
--I hope you brought salsa.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.365
They're for facemasks.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.450
Give me five,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.994
and I'll return with something that'll
change your pores forever.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.001
Remember how I said
Jonah had some play thing tonight?

00:43.085 --> 00:44.670
Uh, no...

00:44.753 --> 00:47.380
Well, it got canceled.
So he's gonna come over now.

00:47.464 --> 00:51.134
My mom's super strict
about him being here. Is that okay?

00:51.218 --> 00:53.011
Yeah, only if Tiny can come, too.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.555
I've been cramming
for this math test all week,

00:54.638 --> 00:56.723
and we haven't been able
to spend any time together.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.767
Except, what about...

00:59.768 --> 01:00.769
Lola.

01:01.645 --> 01:03.105
I don't think she'll mind.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.523
I mean, the more the merrier, right?

01:10.112 --> 01:15.075
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:16.493 --> 01:21.164
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:25.377 --> 01:30.841
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:30.924 --> 01:33.093
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

01:33.176 --> 01:36.847
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

01:51.319 --> 01:53.864
That needs salt and lime.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.115
It's for our faces.

01:55.198 --> 01:56.992
--We're finally having a girls' night.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.745
Free of Shay and Frankie's
pesky boyfriends.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.997
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.499
-For what?
-Mentioning boyfriends.

02:04.582 --> 02:07.044
-Since mine's in a coma?
-Well, yeah.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.005
No, don't apologize.
It's always nice to talk to you.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.676
You never do the pity voice with me.
You know, the...

02:13.759 --> 02:14.760
"How you doing?"

02:14.843 --> 02:17.095
Oh, people did that all the time
when my mom left.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.014
"I'm so sorry."

02:20.473 --> 02:22.685
So what else is on the agenda for tonight?

02:22.768 --> 02:25.270
Oh, mani-pedis,
the rom-com catalog of Kate Hudson,

02:25.353 --> 02:29.775
and three tubs of candy cane ice cream
that I've been hoarding since Christmas.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.235
We don't get to do this
very often anymore.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.486
I want it to be awesome.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.614
Well, I'm going to go work on the play.

02:35.698 --> 02:38.616
If girls' night turns out to be a bust,
you should come visit.

02:38.701 --> 02:40.118
It won't, but thanks.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.746
I'll be in my bedroom.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.719
What are you guys doing here?

02:56.802 --> 02:57.845
Girls' night!

02:57.928 --> 03:00.013
Baaz found out your sister's
having her friends over

03:00.097 --> 03:02.265
and wants to mack on Lola.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.350
She's an idiot.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.019
What are you talking about?
Her makeup tutorials are illuminating.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.479
Okay, you guys gotta go.
Yael is coming over.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.688
Of course she is.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.816
I can't believe your mom buys you
all these designer clothes,

03:10.899 --> 03:13.401
and you just wear
that same weird hoodie every day.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.612
I like my hoodie.
Can you go now?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.781
It wouldn't hurt to take a little bit
of pride in your appearance.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.574
I, for example,
ironed these chinos myself.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.869
Ooh, can I have these?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.036
Sure, if you leave.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.997
These are way too big.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.540
You know what they say.
Big feet...

03:27.624 --> 03:30.002
I don't see how that could be true
from a biological perspective.

03:30.085 --> 03:31.586
We've been over this, Baaz.

03:31.669 --> 03:35.340
Lots of guys with micropenises
go on to live rich and fulfilling lives.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.760
- My feet are bigger than Vijay's.
- Nuh-uh.

03:37.843 --> 03:38.844
Size 12, baby.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.555
Okay, we're putting this rumor to rest,
once and for all.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.057
How are we gonna do that?

03:44.725 --> 03:45.726
We'll measure.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.396
No way.
Yael's coming over.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.148
Right.
Because now that you've got a girlfriend,

03:51.231 --> 03:52.524
you have no time for the important stuff.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.109
Oh, I get it.
He's scared he'll lose.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.194
Did you know that since
you started dating Yael,

03:56.278 --> 03:57.570
you've bailed on us exactly seven times?

03:57.654 --> 03:59.447
That's true, bee-tee-dubs.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.617
Fine.
I'll cancel with Yael.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.245
Excellent.
May the biggest man win.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.958
Can you see this pimple on my chin?

04:11.794 --> 04:14.671
Uh, now that you pointed it out, yes.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.091
But why're you so worried?
It's not like it's your first date.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.761
Well, things have been really
great between us lately.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.513
- I just want tonight to be--
- Pimple free?

04:23.596 --> 04:24.639
Special.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.560
Mom's away,
we've been dating for a while...

04:29.478 --> 04:30.562
I think I might be ready.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.357
-To have sex?
-I'm not doing anything for sure.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.069
I'm just... keeping an open mind.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.406
You're making your judgy face.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.075
Look, you were all worried
about him and Grace,

04:43.158 --> 04:45.118
like, four seconds ago.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.661
Yeah, but that was totally in my head.

04:46.744 --> 04:49.622
I don't think you should do it
just because Jonah expects it.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.292
Well, he's never pressured me.
Not once.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.795
This is what I want.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.674
-Haven't you ever thought about it?
-Yeah, but, like, not for real.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.676
-And Tiny's okay with that?
-Tiny is not like other boys.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.221
He's not obsessed with... all that stuff.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.514
I read that boys think about it
every six seconds.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.766
- All boys?

05:10.185 --> 05:12.229
Whoo! Jonah's here!

05:16.817 --> 05:18.610
Vijay's right.
We have to measure from the base.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.528
But then
they're gonna be shorter.

05:20.612 --> 05:21.613
If we start from anywhere else,

05:21.696 --> 05:23.698
the measurements will be skewed
by the size of the other bits.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.450
Someone's an expert.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.494
Just paid attention in geometry.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.372
You blew me off to do homework?

05:31.373 --> 05:32.749
I thought you told her not to come.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.126
Yeah, he did.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.793
Because he's "deathly ill."

05:35.878 --> 05:38.296
You know what? You don't deserve
my mother's Jewish penicillin.

05:38.380 --> 05:42.300
We, uh... we were, uh, actually just, uh,
having a guys' night.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.262
What could you be doing
that I can't be around for?

05:48.598 --> 05:50.767
-I'm waiting.
-We were gonna watch porn.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.396
What kind?

05:54.479 --> 05:55.981
Uh, your kind?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.815
Or, um, your kind?

05:59.442 --> 06:01.278
- All of them.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.739
Sounds good. Load it up.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.163
Why did you change?
Kate Hudson doesn't care what you wear.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.165
- Well...
- Look who's here.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.208
What is he doing here?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.044
-You didn't tell her?
-Tell me what?

06:17.835 --> 06:19.337
Hey!
Where the party at?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.506
Nice.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.259
We may have invited Jonah and Tiny.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.802
With the rest of the school, apparently.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.055
- Hey, baby.
- What's happening?

06:28.138 --> 06:30.390
Hey. What are they doing here?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.599
Nice to see you, too.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.477
Hanging out?

06:34.561 --> 06:35.812
Well, I guess I thought...

06:35.895 --> 06:38.273
It'd be you and me?

06:38.356 --> 06:40.483
Don't worry. I'm sure
we can find some alone time later.

06:40.567 --> 06:41.609
Hmm?

06:42.235 --> 06:45.280
Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.
Sounds great.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.993
Should we have some actual fun or what?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.456
So much for girls' night.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.798
Hey, and then,
if you've done the thing, you drink.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.508
Uh, what if we don't drink?

07:05.592 --> 07:07.510
Then you can take a sip
of your ginger ale.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.930
Okay.
Okay, I'll start.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.516
-Never have I ever had sex.
-Ooh.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.810
Ooh!

07:22.192 --> 07:23.235
Okay, Jonah.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.863
Okay.
Never have I ever...

07:26.947 --> 07:28.115
hooked up in a pool.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.206
Frankie, your turn.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.209
Uh, never have I ever made out
in a scuzzy roadside motel.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.835
Yeah, that was fun.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.965
Put that on our to-do list.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.425
Do you wanna get outta here?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.219
Yeah.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.182
Have fun, you two.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.725
Okay.
Who's next?

07:59.646 --> 08:02.399
Oh, yeah! Oh, yes!

08:02.482 --> 08:05.068
No wonder women
do ridiculous things to their bodies

08:05.152 --> 08:06.861
if they think that this is what men want.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.738
-Maybe we should turn it off.
-No!

08:11.533 --> 08:14.619
There is no way
that is comfortable for her.

08:14.702 --> 08:17.080
As usual,
it's all about the guy's pleasure.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.248
Okay.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.543
We weren't even
really gonna watch... this.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.378
Right now doesn't seem
like the best time to be honest.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.422
They made me tell you not to come
because we were gonna...

08:25.505 --> 08:27.549
-Don't do it!
-...measure our penises.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.763
So... Uh, I mean, go for it.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.475
I... I don't wanna stand in the way
of scientific exploration.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.768
What? No.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.521
Oh, come on. Don't you need
somebody to adjudicate?

08:42.814 --> 08:44.691
- Turning into...

08:44.774 --> 08:45.775
Never...

08:45.858 --> 08:48.778
Never have I ever wanted to hook up
with the person on my right.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.285
--Mmm.

08:56.119 --> 08:58.330
-Come on. Look at us. Tiny, come on!
-I always thought you guys

08:58.413 --> 08:59.872
- would make a cute couple.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.126
All right. Shay.

09:03.210 --> 09:08.215
Um, never have I ever fooled around
with someone I wasn't in love with.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.597
Oh, yeah, right.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.140
-What about that time with that girl--
-Hey!

09:17.932 --> 09:19.434
Oh! Oh, sorry.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.353
Not in front of the girlfriend.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.480
-Don't listen to him.
-No, what's that about?

09:23.563 --> 09:25.773
Oh. Things are gonna get interesting.

09:25.857 --> 09:28.193
- Uh... Lola.
- Okay.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.277
Um...

09:30.112 --> 09:32.822
Never have I ever ditched
my best friend for my boyfriend,

09:32.905 --> 09:34.366
who I stole from her anyway.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.243
Drink up, Shay.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.910
'Cause all you wanna do
is talk about your boyfriend,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.704
-so let's talk about him.
-Fine.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.081
Never have I ever dated someone,

09:41.164 --> 09:43.375
even though I knew
my friend liked him first.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.377
For the gazillionth time,
you said it was okay.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.420
Oh, you just don't like it
that you're single and I'm not.

09:47.504 --> 09:48.546
Please, as if.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.298
Okay, maybe we should just call it quits.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.966
Um, let's play a new game.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.801
How about truth or dare?

09:54.469 --> 09:55.595
Tiny, truth or dare?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.265
Uh... dare.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.101
I dare you to spend
seven minutes in heaven with Shay.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.437
Seven minutes alone with my girl?
No problem.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.189
Uh, sorry.
I'm claustrophobic.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.774
Okay, then.
Lola.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.109
What? No!

10:09.192 --> 10:11.403
Whoa.
Um, I don't think that's a good idea.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.695
You don't trust your man, Shay?

10:12.779 --> 10:15.990
You got yourself
a jealous one there, Tiny.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.160
-Hey, guys. Lay off.
-No, you know what?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.827
Go ahead.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.539
- It's no big deal, right?
- Right.

10:29.087 --> 10:29.921
Okay. Um...

10:30.505 --> 10:31.506
Here's what we're gonna do.

10:31.589 --> 10:34.050
Everybody is gonna
take a picture of themselves

10:34.134 --> 10:35.302
while holding a ruler.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.638
Then you're gonna send them to me
and I'll declare a winner.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.393
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna screen cap them.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.102
So you're going to look at pictures
of my friends' junk?

10:45.187 --> 10:47.522
Don't be such a prude.
Where can I find a ruler?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.442
Downstairs in the study.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.407
Dude!
She hasn't even seen my...

10:57.490 --> 10:58.658
whatever in real life yet.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.285
You're the one who told her
what we were going to do.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.370
That's only because you made us
seem like a bunch of pervs

11:02.454 --> 11:03.913
by saying we were gonna watch porn.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.498
And the truth was better how?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.083
You think you're
so much better than me.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.252
With your hair and your girlfriend.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.423
-You're not even allowed to date.
-You have no idea how lucky you are.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.343
Lucky? Seriously?

11:16.426 --> 11:20.388
You have all this money, and a girlfriend,
and you take it all for granted.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.936
All right, who's first?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.902
Only three and a half minutes to go, Shay.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.990
Hang in there.
It's almost over.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.243
I'm fine.
Thanks, though.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.911
You wouldn't have to worry
if you were meeting Tiny's needs.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.749
What?
It's no secret she's uptight.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.584
She's barely even touched her drink.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.628
Okay, maybe ease off a little bit.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.255
She thinks she's so much better than me

11:53.338 --> 11:55.632
just because she won't let
her boyfriend touch her.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.344
We both get straight A's, you know.
I just like having more fun.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.554
Right, 'cause it's so much fun being easy.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.306
- Whoa, girl-on-girl crime.
- No, I'm just...

12:03.390 --> 12:06.183
I don't understand
why everyone is so obsessed with sex.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.353
Well, maybe you should run along
and leave the grown-ups alone.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.192
Fine.
Tired of these stupid games, anyway.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.088
Whoa, what are you doing?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.633
I thought we could...
you know...

12:38.716 --> 12:40.552
Frankie...

12:40.635 --> 12:42.429
My mom's not gonna
be back until tomorrow.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.180
Yeah, that's not the issue.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.348
You've had sex with other girls.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.934
Yeah.
But that doesn't mean it's right for us.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.270
Straight edge doesn't mean celibate.
I googled it.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.022
It's not because I'm straight edge.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.359
Is it because of Grace?

12:56.443 --> 12:58.277
Oh, my God.

12:58.361 --> 12:59.862
You guys have been spending
a lot of time together.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.823
Grace and I are just friends.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.616
I promise.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.660
So it's just that you don't want
to do it with me.

13:06.578 --> 13:07.704
No. No, Frankie,

13:07.787 --> 13:10.332
back when I was doing it,
I wasn't a good guy.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.960
And I don't wanna rush things
and risk ruining what we have.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.963
Yeah. All right.
Message received.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.007
-Frankie...
-No. I get it.

13:20.091 --> 13:22.427
-No, Frankie, there's a fire!
-Oh, crap!

13:26.431 --> 13:27.474
Frankie!

13:31.853 --> 13:32.854
You okay?

13:35.690 --> 13:36.733
Okay, um...

13:38.860 --> 13:40.069
I think I should go.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.614
Can we talk later?

13:43.614 --> 13:45.158
I think I need a little space.

13:53.375 --> 13:55.084
- That's my foot.
- Sorry.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.461
Hold on.

13:58.546 --> 14:01.173
- Is there something wrong with me?
- What?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.801
I've always thought
I was pretty nice to spend time with.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.887
Well, you are.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.014
Except Shay and Frankie both invited
their boyfriends

14:08.097 --> 14:09.306
just to get out of girls' night.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.519
Quality time is important for couples.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.062
And it's not for friends?

14:14.646 --> 14:17.815
- I'm everyone's second choice.
- That's crazy.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.191
You're a great girl.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.818
So great you dumped me for my best friend?

14:21.861 --> 14:23.738
I am sorry about that.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.407
We used to have so much fun together.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.867
- Especially our snack parties.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.370
- Remember the barbecue chip incident?

14:31.287 --> 14:32.329
You're ridiculous.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.249
And that's what makes you awesome.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.504
There's got to be, what, at least
one guy out there who'll appreciate that.

14:41.881 --> 14:42.882
You're right.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.009
There is.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.844
Time's up, you two.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.223
Did you kiss?

14:51.891 --> 14:53.935
-What?
-I would never do that to you.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.604
Guess she'll give you what I won't.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.399
Okay. I'm pretty sure I should be
offended by that, so I am.

14:59.482 --> 15:00.733
Where are you going?

15:02.985 --> 15:06.573
-She was upset. I hugged her.
-I'm sorry if I'm not enough for you.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.408
-What are you talking about?
-You drank!

15:08.491 --> 15:09.701
I was sitting to your right!

15:10.452 --> 15:13.538
It's not a crime to want
to hook up with my girlfriend.

15:13.621 --> 15:14.872
So, you do want sex.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.875
You know, I thought you were different.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.712
So you only like me
when I'm the perfect science student?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.130
But this isn't you.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.299
Don't tell me who I am!

15:26.426 --> 15:27.552
Wait!

15:40.106 --> 15:41.607
Hey, do you feel better?

15:42.650 --> 15:45.402
- I lit my room on fire.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.907
I thought guys were supposed
to want sex all the time.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.660
Do we have to talk about this?

15:53.911 --> 15:57.039
Okay, fine.
Maybe he has herpes.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.418
Or I'm repulsive and he hates me.

16:04.255 --> 16:08.676
Some guys get weird about
the whole virginity thing.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.889
They think that if they're your first,
then you'll get all... clingy.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.057
Hmm, Jonah's not like that.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.768
I don't think.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.935
Well, hey...

16:19.103 --> 16:20.688
there is an upside.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.064
Which is?

16:22.148 --> 16:24.400
- You didn't burn the house down.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.408
No matter what happens here today,

16:32.492 --> 16:34.702
let's promise not to let it
get in the way of our friendship.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.830
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:41.751 --> 16:42.960
You don't have to worry.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.462
- You won by, like, a lot.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.089
That's exactly why I'm worried.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.008
Don't tell me you're embarrassed.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.384
But we haven't even...

16:50.467 --> 16:51.928
You know...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.305
Besides, if you tell them I won,

16:54.388 --> 16:55.515
they're just gonna think
you're saying that

16:55.598 --> 16:56.808
because you're my girlfriend.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.310
That's all I am now?
Your girlfriend?

16:59.393 --> 17:01.604
-No, no! It's just--
-Before, we used to hang out all the time.

17:01.688 --> 17:05.149
Now that we're dating,
I'm... I'm in some other category.

17:05.232 --> 17:06.859
It's not like I have
a bunch of other people

17:06.943 --> 17:08.194
that I can go hang out with.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.612
I know.
It's just...

17:09.696 --> 17:11.823
hard to know when you're my friend
and when you're my girlfriend.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.951
I can be both.
I should be both.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.285
Yes, absolutely.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.705
But, still...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.542
You want me to lie about who won?

17:22.625 --> 17:24.669
He could really use this.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.088
He's, like...
He's jealous of me or something.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.840
I don't get it, but he is.

17:29.841 --> 17:31.968
I get it.
You're awesome.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.974
Okay, fine.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.685
I'll do it.
But you owe me.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.145
Okay, I have the results.

17:44.438 --> 17:48.109
And... the winner is...

17:51.153 --> 17:52.655
Baaz.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.490
Yes! I knew it!

17:54.574 --> 17:58.703
USA! USA! USA! USA!

17:58.786 --> 18:01.080
- We've created a monster.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.670
What happened to you?

18:08.337 --> 18:11.340
I tried to hook up with Jonah
and instead I lit my room on fire.

18:12.299 --> 18:13.425
You?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.219
I slut-shamed Esme,

18:15.302 --> 18:18.014
and then drove my boyfriend
into a closet with another girl.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.601
Turns out you're right.
All boys are obsessed with sex.

18:21.684 --> 18:22.727
Not Jonah.

18:25.187 --> 18:29.066
I'm sorry you almost died,
but I'm kind of glad you didn't do it.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.193
I didn't want to be the only one
not having sex.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.364
- Guys are the worst.
- Seriously.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.953
- Mmm.

18:45.041 --> 18:48.460
"I'll be here for you.
But you need to be there for him."

18:49.837 --> 18:51.756
Is this the first time
they meet in the play?

18:51.839 --> 18:53.090
Yeah.
What do you think?

18:54.258 --> 18:55.301
It's good, but...

18:56.427 --> 18:58.470
Never mind.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.222
-It's stupid.
-No, tell me.

19:01.557 --> 19:05.477
Well, maybe Hope should be
a voice at first.

19:05.561 --> 19:10.149
Or else people won't get that she's...
more than a person. You know?

19:10.858 --> 19:14.111
Yeah. That's... that's perfect.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.404
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.073
That's actually what it needs.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.077
Thanks for ditching girls' night to help.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.369
Well, I'm pretty sure I got ditched.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.872
But... you're welcome.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.416
Hey, do you want to play Hope?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.753
I've been having
a really hard time casting the part...

19:32.088 --> 19:34.090
but I think you'd be perfect for it.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.093
You're really awesome, Lola.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.097
I don't think that's a good idea.

19:42.639 --> 19:43.891
Why is that?

19:45.351 --> 19:46.769
Because I like you.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.981
And I tried not to, but I do.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.360
And I'm worried if we spend
too much time together...

19:55.652 --> 19:57.822
we might do something
that will get us both in trouble.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.699
Like what?

20:04.787 --> 20:06.497
Are you sure you want this?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.566
Are you thinking about Tristan?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.530
Was that a weird thing to say?

20:40.489 --> 20:41.657
Very.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.326
-Thought you might be feeling--
-Guilty?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.287
Yeah.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.415
So...

20:49.498 --> 20:50.499
do you?

20:52.543 --> 20:53.585
Yeah.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.346
But I also feel good.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.476
I never thought my first time
would be with someone

21:09.560 --> 21:10.853
whose boyfriend's in a coma.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.898
Or with someone who has a boyfriend.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.818
Oh, don't worry.
I'm cool with the bisexual thing.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.861
No... it's not that.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.323
That was your first time?

21:22.406 --> 21:24.408
Yeah, but it's no big deal.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.618
-You say that, but--
-And I mean it.

21:26.702 --> 21:30.039
Okay. I'm not gonna get all clingy
just because you took my precious flower.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.417
Okay...
because we... we can't--

21:33.500 --> 21:35.627
Date?
I know.

21:36.838 --> 21:40.049
Let's just enjoy... whatever this is.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.426
Okay?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.637
Yeah, I'd like that.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.399
-Where were you all night?
-Um, I fell asleep in the guest room.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.987
Look, I'm sorry I freaked out.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.031
I was just being crazy and insecure.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.908
I'm sorry, too.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.784
I shouldn't have gone
into that closet with Tiny.

22:08.744 --> 22:11.580
And we never did it when we were together,
in case you thought we did.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.707
But you drank.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.292
Was it someone else?

22:15.376 --> 22:16.793
No...

22:16.878 --> 22:18.963
I guess I thought that
if you thought that we did it,

22:19.046 --> 22:23.300
then I could feel like
my relationship with him was important.

22:25.136 --> 22:26.637
--Don't laugh.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.846
No, it's just...

22:27.930 --> 22:30.266
I mean, I've been worried
about living up to you.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.895
But if you didn't, that's great.
That means none of us are doing it.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.897
Only you would find that exciting, Shay.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.024
You know what,
it is probably for the best anyway.

22:38.107 --> 22:40.067
Sex just complicates things.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.277
Only if you let it.

22:46.782 --> 22:48.575
So girls' night wasn't a total bust.

22:48.659 --> 22:51.412
Yeah.
How about post-pancake pedicures?

22:51.495 --> 22:54.706
-Sound good, Lo?
-Uh, yeah. Totally.
