WEBVTT

00:08.908 --> 00:12.379
We're back and it's gonna be
bigger and better than ever.

00:12.445 --> 00:15.248
Bucking, birds and banter.
Two new housemates?

00:15.315 --> 00:17.717
I grill more birds
than George Foreman.

00:17.784 --> 00:20.987
I'm young, I'm fresh
and I love bucking birds.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.389
(all cheer)

00:22.455 --> 00:24.290
The biggest argument ever.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.626
Engagement party's been
a fucking joke.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.095
It all ends in tears.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.697
You're a fucking arsehole!

00:30.764 --> 00:32.499
You're a fucking psycho.

00:32.564 --> 00:34.000
He's a fucking bell end.

00:34.067 --> 00:36.703
(Charlotte) I'm on an rampage.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.271
Psycho Charlotte is back.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.607
I'm gonna leave.

00:40.673 --> 00:43.376
I don't know how I'm gonna do
this without him.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.878
I'm absolutely gutted.

00:45.945 --> 00:50.216
It's dead weird seeing James with
a girl who he really cares about.

00:50.283 --> 00:53.620
I've heard he shags
like a dog with two dicks!

00:53.686 --> 00:56.523
Fuck it. She's paid money.
I'll show her a good time.

00:56.589 --> 00:59.526
Gary's the reason
that me and Scott have finished.

00:59.592 --> 01:01.928
She's in me bed again.
Is this a good idea?

01:01.995 --> 01:04.164
The feelings are
coming back for Gary.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.169
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.371
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.706
If you look up pulling,
I'm next to it.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.775
I won't kiss a guy
without a six-pack.

01:15.842 --> 01:17.844
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.846
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.948
Got the looks, the charm.
Just works.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.417
I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.252
The hardest graft I do is my hair.

01:26.319 --> 01:28.888
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:40.333 --> 01:44.237
(Anna) Urgh, dirty little animals.

01:53.880 --> 01:59.719
I've woken up to find a letter
off that stupid bitch, Anna.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.688
Oh, for fuck's sake, Anna.

02:01.754 --> 02:05.758
Telling me that employees have been
complaining about us.

02:05.825 --> 02:09.863
We're shit at working. She's gonna
send us to do some hard graft.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.332
I already know
what real hard work is, Anna.

02:12.398 --> 02:14.067
I do me own false tan.

02:14.133 --> 02:16.202
After everything we did for her.

02:16.269 --> 02:19.472
It's nearly over
and then Anna goes and does this.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.375
I've been mint at my massages.

02:22.442 --> 02:25.612
She intends to show us
what real hard work is today.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.747
So, get yourself ready.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.015
Oh, for fuck's sake.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.185
Scotty should have showed
the customers a happy ending.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.156
Bye, Vic. See you when we get back.

02:42.161 --> 02:44.797
I've told the others
I'm not feeling well,

02:44.864 --> 02:48.134
but I want to go
and I want to be with me fiance

02:48.201 --> 02:50.169
cos I miss him and cos I love him.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.805
I've loved me time
in the Geordie Shore house,

02:52.872 --> 02:56.609
but me and Ricci are more important
and we need to be together.

03:02.148 --> 03:03.783
So, we get there to find

03:03.850 --> 03:06.786
that Anna's got us doing
marine fitness training.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.156
The lads should be all right.
The girls are gonna struggle.

03:10.223 --> 03:11.724
Get out!

03:11.791 --> 03:15.828
I'm refusing to get out of the car.
So is Sophie.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.497
I've hurt me arm.

03:17.564 --> 03:22.101
How dare this man scream at me,
telling me to run? Is he dreaming?

03:22.168 --> 03:24.437
I'm not gonna get out.
Lads. Get her out.

03:24.504 --> 03:28.141
What the fuck? I'm not gonna run
around a field in the soaking wet.

03:28.207 --> 03:32.812
You can't physically put your hands
on me. Me hair's gonna run! Don't!

03:32.879 --> 03:36.249
Me hair's gonna run down.
It'll look like someone's period.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.918
You can't touch me.
It's against me human rights.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.820
There's no way I'm getting out.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.957
Go on. Keep running till you see
the cone, then go right.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.759
Go!
I haven't got a bra on.

03:48.161 --> 03:51.364
Everyone's gonna hate this
with a hangover, but I love it.

03:51.431 --> 03:53.099
Hash tag cos I'm pure brick.

03:53.166 --> 03:57.704
(Gaz) It isn't a punishment.
I fucking love it. The lads love it.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.138
The girls...

03:59.205 --> 04:01.307
(girls scream)

04:01.374 --> 04:03.443
...absolutely hate it.

04:03.509 --> 04:06.779
You're not supposed
to walk through nettles.

04:06.846 --> 04:09.549
This is my worst nightmare,
to be running,

04:09.616 --> 04:12.085
doing any form of exercise
in the rain.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.054
Ah! Ow! Ow, no! Ow, no!

04:15.121 --> 04:19.858
Yet again, this is a reward for the
boys and a punishment for the girls.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.527
Nettles? No, no, no!

04:21.594 --> 04:23.863
I'm sorry that I haven't got a cock,
Anna,

04:23.930 --> 04:25.832
but I can get a strap on.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.438
If Holly can sit in the taxi
and not do it, so can I.

04:32.505 --> 04:34.974
I'm not doing it!

04:35.041 --> 04:37.243
Come back here.
Lads, go and catch her.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.513
I'm giving up and giving up now.
I'm throwing in the towel.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.851
The only exercise they're used to
is the walk of shame.

04:45.985 --> 04:47.286
Fucking hell.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.969
Gaz is telling us how Charlotte
tried to jump in his bed again.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.203
For fuck's sake.

05:04.270 --> 05:06.539
I think she's still got
feelings for you.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.608
Me and Charlotte are getting on,

05:08.675 --> 05:12.278
but it's going to
that sneaking in, flirting stage

05:12.345 --> 05:14.147
and I've got to be very careful.

05:20.319 --> 05:24.357
I don't feel bad about trying
to get in Gary's bed.

05:24.424 --> 05:27.627
It's coming to the end
and I'm starting to realise

05:27.694 --> 05:30.797
that now the feelings are
coming back for Gary.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.699
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.967
Cheers, mate. Much appreciated.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.246
(James) Hey! All right?

05:47.313 --> 05:50.283
So, we get back to the house
and Vicky's sat on the sofa

05:50.349 --> 05:52.018
and all her cases are packed.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.320
And I'm like, fuck.

05:54.387 --> 05:58.458
I've gotta say, I'm leaving now cos I
want you to have good memories of us

05:58.524 --> 06:00.927
rather than us become
this miserable cow.

06:00.993 --> 06:04.464
I didn't think she'd last.
I'm pleased she did,

06:04.530 --> 06:08.401
cos for once I think she enjoyed
herself with us and not just Ricci.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.936
Bye, Vic.
Bye, babes.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.003
I'm gutted,

06:11.070 --> 06:14.807
but I know she needs to do this
cos she's been feeling so, so down.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.876
It's selfish to want her to stay.

06:17.944 --> 06:21.948
I've had such an amazing time
and I love everyone here so much

06:22.014 --> 06:23.783
that I want to leave on that note.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.285
Bye, Vic!
(girls) Bye.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.854
I'm not going forever.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.390
This is just me saying I can
no longer do this without me fiance.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.961
Fuck. Right, the mam's left.

06:35.027 --> 06:37.563
Now it's just a bunch of kids
running around.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.931
(burping)

06:40.767 --> 06:44.537
Is Dan going on his date now?
Dan's got his date with a cougar.

06:44.604 --> 06:47.039
At the auction,
Dan got bought off a cougar.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.908
All right, Dan man? Come on.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.410
Do you want a drink
for some Dutch courage?

06:51.477 --> 06:53.846
(Dan) I'm feeling a bit apprehensive.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.448
I don't have a clue.

06:55.515 --> 06:59.085
Dan, mate,
you gotta neck on with her.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.888
She's old enough to be me mam.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.690
Right, boys. I'm off.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.526
Enjoy it.
I will.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.628
I've never been
on a date with a cougar.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.535
All right?
Hello.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.237
Is Gina about?
Gina!

07:18.304 --> 07:20.173
So, today's me date with Gina.

07:20.239 --> 07:22.341
I've got to do whatever Gina wants.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.544
I'll show you.
All right. Let's go.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.513
Judging by the look on her face,
she wants to ruin me.

07:31.684 --> 07:32.852
Is that nice?

07:36.389 --> 07:40.526
So, I'm massaging away and Gina wants
me to take her bra off.

07:40.593 --> 07:42.128
No bother.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.198
What happens with you
is nobody's business. (laughs)

07:46.999 --> 07:49.368
How was that? All right? Yeah?

07:49.435 --> 07:51.838
Give me a shout
next time you need a massage.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.140
Put me down for four times.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.943
Absolutely gorgeous.
Nice seeing you, Gina.

07:57.009 --> 07:59.412
See you later.
See you next time. Bye.

07:59.478 --> 08:01.681
So, I thought I'd escaped unharmed.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.216
Dan, come here.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.151
She bursts out the fucking door.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.588
Oh, such soft lips you got.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.559
Oh! Fuck's sake!

08:14.994 --> 08:15.995
Oh!

08:19.365 --> 08:21.400
So, I get back
and I've told the lads.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.969
They're in stitches.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.239
Right at the end, right,
she bursts out the fucking door,

08:26.305 --> 08:27.907
chases us up the street.

08:27.974 --> 08:29.542
(all laugh)

08:29.609 --> 08:32.611
She starts necking on with us.
I'm like, urgh...

08:34.813 --> 08:38.017
Nightmare for the kid.
He's never gonna live this down.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.719
You got a bit of gel there.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.292
So, Ricci and Vicky are gone
and it's just...

08:46.359 --> 08:48.127
It feels so weird.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.897
So now we're just left
with the Sexual Seven

08:50.963 --> 08:52.598
and we're all gonna run crazy.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.667
(cheering)
Riverside!

08:57.036 --> 08:59.705
We are hitting Voodoo Riverside.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.612
The Lucky Seven.
The Sexual Seven.

09:06.679 --> 09:10.283
Cheers to the Sexual Seven,
and we're gonna have a mint night.

09:12.251 --> 09:15.788
We're Riverside. The Buck Squad
decide, "Let's swap for a bit."

09:15.855 --> 09:18.457
"Dance with Charlotte.
I'll dance with Holly."

09:18.524 --> 09:19.692
Let's go!

09:19.759 --> 09:21.827
Why is Gary trying
to make us jealous?

09:21.894 --> 09:23.729
It's obvious he's in love with us.

09:23.796 --> 09:26.132
Obviously the only thing
I'm gonna do back

09:26.198 --> 09:28.801
is make him jealous
by flirting with Scotty T.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.269
(shrieks)

09:31.370 --> 09:32.505
He's bending us over

09:32.571 --> 09:35.675
and we're doing sexual positions
and it's fabulous.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.747
I think Charlotte might be jealous
I'm dancing with Gary.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.017
It is just banter. I'd be fuming
if she did it with James.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.786
I win!

09:55.895 --> 09:58.130
Get back and there's
fuck all happening,

09:58.197 --> 09:59.966
so I get everyone in the garden.

10:00.032 --> 10:01.567
Let's spice things up a bit.

10:06.605 --> 10:09.709
You do it first,
cos we're obviously gonna do it.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.677
Go on, lads. Just a peck.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.681
So, we've told Gary and Scott

10:15.748 --> 10:18.117
if they kiss,
me and Charlotte will kiss.

10:19.051 --> 10:22.822
I will do fucking anything
to see two girls neck on.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.257
It just means that I've got
to kiss Scott.

10:25.324 --> 10:26.425
(girls laugh)

10:28.561 --> 10:32.264
The boys have been sucked in. As if
me and Charlotte were gonna kiss.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.039
Looks like the Scott and Gary
bromance continues.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.173
Right, fuck it.

10:41.240 --> 10:45.478
I can't believe it. I never thought
I'd lose Gary to another boy.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.516
How can you keep a straight face?
This is a nightmare.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.252
(cat-calling)

10:53.319 --> 10:54.620
What the fuck?

10:54.687 --> 10:56.889
Tonight is the night shit goes down.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.892
(screams)
I haven't done fuck all.

10:59.959 --> 11:03.329
I'm a little bit jealous.
Holly's not OK with James and Kate.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.930
Could my day get any worse?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.869
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:23.716 --> 11:27.086
# Too much light in this window

11:27.153 --> 11:29.055
# Don't wake me up #

11:29.121 --> 11:31.457
(screams)

11:31.524 --> 11:35.628
Gaz, Gaz, how funny is that?

11:35.694 --> 11:39.832
The girls made me and Scott kiss
and then didn't come through.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.637
Gary and Scott finally kissed.

11:44.703 --> 11:49.842
So, apparently Gaz and Scott shared
a romantic kiss in the hot tub.

11:49.909 --> 11:53.079
I'm excited, actually.
I've never been to a gay wedding.

11:54.847 --> 11:57.249
It's not like
it's never happened before.

11:57.316 --> 12:02.054
# Gary and Scott sitting in a tree,
K-I-S-S-I-N-G #

12:04.590 --> 12:06.859
It's bank holiday
and it means one thing.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.061
We're getting dolled up.

12:09.128 --> 12:13.966
We're hitting the streets of Jesmond
for an all-day session.

12:14.033 --> 12:15.668
(laughter)

12:15.734 --> 12:19.405
Check it out. Just found that
upstairs. You know who's that is?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.774
That's fucking Gina.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.577
The one that won Dan
that day at the charity thing.

12:24.643 --> 12:26.946
Shut up, man.
Mate, banter. Ring her.

12:27.012 --> 12:29.014
This will be funny.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.850
I haven't taken the piss enough.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.220
Jesmond's going to be rammed.
What are we gonna do?

12:34.286 --> 12:35.788
Oh, shit, it's ringing.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.824
Ring Gina to turn up.

12:38.891 --> 12:40.960
"Hello?"
Hi. Is that Gina?

12:41.026 --> 12:44.497
"Hiya. It is, yeah. Who is it?"
It's just James, Dan's friend.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.165
He's been talking about you.

12:46.232 --> 12:48.501
If you came out today,
you'd make his day.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.769
I can't wait to see
the look on Dan's face

12:50.836 --> 12:52.171
when Gina rocks up.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.140
Right, I'll see you later on.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.876
"Right. Oh, see you then.
See you. Bye."

13:00.012 --> 13:02.181
It's bank holiday in Newcastle.

13:02.248 --> 13:05.885
I think that's a good enough excuse
to get pissed during the day.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.454
Am I doing it on your back?
Yes.

13:08.521 --> 13:12.391
Then why the hell have you only given
us that much? Oh, shut up.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.027
We're all going to Jesmond.

13:15.094 --> 13:17.730
It just means getting mortal
and pulling birds.

13:17.796 --> 13:21.767
We'll have a few drinks, a laugh
and tonight is just gonna go mental.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.604
(Gaz) Drinks are flowing. The sun
is shining. Jesmond's is rammed.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.607
Perfect timing
for Gina just to rock up.

13:28.674 --> 13:30.843
That foam party will be
fucking mint.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.678
What's you doing?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.046
Oi-oi!

13:34.113 --> 13:35.681
How you doing? All right?

13:36.815 --> 13:39.618
Oi the fucking oi. Here's Gina.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.020
Lovely to meet you.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.888
I've heard loads about you.

13:42.955 --> 13:46.625
I can't believe it. It's Gina.
This is such a fucking nightmare.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.127
(laughs)

13:49.528 --> 13:50.863
Not shy, are you?

13:51.797 --> 13:53.933
I give a good massage.
Aye, you do.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.569
It's the best £20 I've ever spent.
(laughs)

13:58.504 --> 14:01.574
I feel like I've got
me own real-life stalker.

14:01.640 --> 14:05.844
This is hilarious.
Dan's face is a picture.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.346
That was priceless.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.948
Dan's mortified.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.617
Do you like me with the glasses
or without them?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.653
Both.
(women laugh)

14:15.988 --> 14:19.391
This is hands-down the best prank
ever played in the house.

14:26.565 --> 14:29.101
If Gina had her own way,
she would eat me alive.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.336
See you later.

14:30.402 --> 14:33.639
So that lads have had me pants down,
tanned me arse...

14:34.773 --> 14:37.443
All right, lads.
Please, let's call this a day.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.148
I'm so drunk.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.385
We get back to the house
and I'm really drunk,

14:46.452 --> 14:49.622
so all I need right now is
a cuddle from James.

14:49.688 --> 14:50.923
I miss you.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.725
Do you miss us?
Mm-hmm.

14:55.427 --> 14:56.528
Hello, Joel.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.163
So, I ring Joel.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.531
How are you?

15:03.369 --> 15:05.804
He tells us he's DJing
in Newcastle tonight,

15:05.871 --> 15:08.040
which is perfect
cos I get to see him.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.376
You don't sound happy.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.012
When I'm speaking to him
he's sounding down

15:13.078 --> 15:16.148
and he's sounding moody.
That's getting us pissed off.

15:16.215 --> 15:19.184
There no point in ringing someone
who's so boring.

15:19.251 --> 15:22.454
The only way I can end this call
is to tell him to fuck off.

15:22.521 --> 15:23.656
Er... fuck off.

15:23.722 --> 15:25.524
And I do. Then I hang up.

15:26.725 --> 15:27.726
(laughs)

15:27.793 --> 15:31.130
He's got no excuse to be moody.
What the fuck's up with him?

15:34.433 --> 15:38.537
I'm gonna go all out tonight
and even iron my fucking shoelaces.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.308
You might get a nice compliment
about how straight your laces are.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.209
Let's all laugh now in happiness.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.911
(both laugh)

15:47.279 --> 15:49.014
You've just won the lottery.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.449
(both scream)

16:00.959 --> 16:02.828
I like this game.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.496
What are you doing?

16:04.563 --> 16:06.799
We're playing a game.
Want to join?

16:06.865 --> 16:08.567
OK.
Just act...

16:08.634 --> 16:10.269
You've just got to do it.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.770
What's another one, Soph?

16:11.837 --> 16:13.839
You're about to have an orgasm.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.474
(both make orgasm noises)

16:19.311 --> 16:21.447
(girls laugh)

16:23.048 --> 16:24.583
Me eyelashes are on.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.185
Me tan's done.
Good.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.288
Tonight is the night shit goes down.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.423
(whooping)

16:31.490 --> 16:33.325
Party, baby.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.428
So, tonight we are back on the lash.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.163
Who's gonna be the drunkest?

16:38.230 --> 16:39.598
(all) Me!

16:40.733 --> 16:44.136
Bank holiday Sunday at Liquid.
It's gonna be fucking rammed.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.038
I just can't wait to get there.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.883
(Sophie) Joel's DJing.
It's gonna be amazing.

16:57.950 --> 17:01.487
I just hope he's not in that
stinking mood that he was before.

17:02.955 --> 17:07.159
Sophie's lad's DJing. The kid
couldn't even mix a vodka coke.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.628
Let's get fucking mortal.
Let's get fucking mortal.

17:13.832 --> 17:17.703
So, I go over and see Joel and he's
got a face like a smacked arse.

17:23.242 --> 17:26.444
And he sits me down
and he's still in a mood.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.493
That is a lie. No, listen...

17:41.560 --> 17:44.897
And he's asking me
if I've cheated on him.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.165
What the fuck?

17:46.231 --> 17:50.803
Why would I ever, ever,
ever cheat on you? Why?

17:50.869 --> 17:53.372
(Charlotte) Sophie and Joel are
arguing.

17:53.439 --> 17:57.443
I can see her mouthing the words,
"I would never cheat on you."

17:57.509 --> 17:58.977
I know what that's about.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.979
There were rumours going round

18:01.046 --> 18:03.816
that Sophie had slept with Yab
at the house party.

18:05.250 --> 18:09.121
I can't believe Joel is actually
believing these rumours are true.

18:09.188 --> 18:12.057
I haven't done fuck all.
If I'd done something...

18:12.124 --> 18:13.525
Why are so many people...

18:13.592 --> 18:16.128
I'd say,
"You know what, Joel? I did."

18:16.195 --> 18:21.300
So, Joel's accusing Sophie of
cheating on him with my mate Yabber.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.802
I think that's a bit rich,
coming from him.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.405
Remember that time
I lied in the bed and cried?

18:26.472 --> 18:28.974
I thought you'd done something.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.442
That's how I feel now.

18:30.509 --> 18:32.444
I feel like how you were with me.

18:32.511 --> 18:36.648
They do always say that the ones
who cheat are the most paranoid.

18:39.117 --> 18:41.653
I've been hurt before
by people cheating on me

18:41.720 --> 18:44.490
so I wouldn't dare do this
to the boy I love.

18:44.556 --> 18:48.527
These rumours are bullshit and I'm
angry at Joel for believing them.

18:48.594 --> 18:52.331
It doesn't add up, Sophie.
Joel, I've done fuck all wrong.

18:52.397 --> 18:55.300
I don't know what's going on.
There's no closure.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.769
He's walking off
and going to Manchester.

18:57.836 --> 19:00.105
How am I ever going
to sort this out now?

19:00.172 --> 19:01.440
I don't know what to do.

19:01.507 --> 19:02.808
He's not believing us.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.243
I'm fucked.

19:09.114 --> 19:13.051
(Charlotte) Sophie's left, but we're
gonna make the most of the night.

19:13.118 --> 19:15.254
Me and Gary go round in circles.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.156
I think I'll always have
feelings for Gary,

19:18.223 --> 19:21.760
because every time we get
put together, they come rushing back.

19:22.828 --> 19:26.164
(Gary) We've been friends,
we haven't, she had a boyfriend.

19:26.231 --> 19:30.202
The only thing we haven't tried
is me having a girlfriend.

19:30.269 --> 19:32.804
Can you imagine me introducing
a girlfriend?

19:32.871 --> 19:34.706
She'd just punch her in the face.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.776
I'm dancing,
I'm having a good time.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.280
And next thing you know,
Kate turns up.

19:41.346 --> 19:44.249
Usually I'd be absolutely fine,

19:44.316 --> 19:48.120
but for some reason this time
I'm watching the way he looks at her

19:48.186 --> 19:49.454
and I'm just jealous.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.291
Every time I see Kate,

19:52.357 --> 19:55.427
my feelings just seem
to get stronger and stronger.

19:55.494 --> 19:57.329
I've never felt like this before.

19:57.396 --> 20:00.799
And I'm like, "Where the fuck
have these feelings come from?"

20:00.866 --> 20:03.001
I thought I was OK and I'm not.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.048
If that was Gary and another girl

20:16.114 --> 20:19.685
and I had to watch them being so
close like that, I couldn't do it.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.153
I couldn't do it at all.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.424
Holly has been kidding herself.

20:25.490 --> 20:27.926
She needs to realise
that it's OK not to be OK.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.461
She can cry if she wants.

20:29.528 --> 20:33.198
That's OK as well, because she's got
all of us here for her.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.801
James used to say
that I would give him the look

20:35.867 --> 20:39.338
and now I look at James and Kate
and he gives her the look.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.240
I realise that
he never actually gave me the look.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.277
I was just looking
for the look that was never there.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.857
(Scott) I'm fucking ready
for some scran.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.360
We get back
and Sophie's already there.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.997
It didn't happen. He made
a massive deal out of nothing.

21:05.063 --> 21:08.867
I found out what's happened.
For him to even have the audacity

21:08.934 --> 21:10.335
to accuse her of cheating

21:10.402 --> 21:13.238
after everything he put her through,
is out of order.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.143
I don't want to cry over Joel.
That's all I've done.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.379
I've been so happy this time round

21:20.445 --> 21:22.681
and I'm not letting Joel
ruin this again.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.916
Remember when you met us?
"What is that?"

21:24.983 --> 21:26.985
You all right, Holly?
No.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.287
Everyone seems
really unhappy tonight.

21:29.354 --> 21:30.656
I'm an emotional wreck.

21:30.722 --> 21:34.893
The person who I usually go to
in the house is James,

21:34.960 --> 21:37.095
but I can't cry to James
about James.

21:37.162 --> 21:40.198
So the next person I feel close to
out of the boys is Gary.

21:40.265 --> 21:42.167
(cries)

21:42.234 --> 21:43.669
I do feel sorry for Holly,

21:43.735 --> 21:46.705
but I think her feelings
for James are bottled up.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.574
She's been brave,
but now she's just let it all out.

22:02.754 --> 22:04.723
With Holly, I can relate to her

22:04.790 --> 22:07.325
with what I've been through
with Charlotte.

22:09.227 --> 22:12.564
I can't believe that Gary feels
the same way about Charlotte

22:12.631 --> 22:13.799
as I do about James.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.347
Gary's the biggest liar
I've ever met in my whole life.

22:30.415 --> 22:32.584
And suddenly here comes Gary,

22:32.651 --> 22:37.389
skipping along as if nothing's
wrong, and dives into my bed.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.657
Right next to me.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.258
Are you fucking kidding?

22:40.325 --> 22:42.527
Get out. I'm about to shout at you.

22:42.594 --> 22:44.730
You know it's not true.
Do you know why?

22:44.796 --> 22:47.866
You know I've started
to like you again. You know that.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.000
Why did you say that?

22:49.067 --> 22:50.102
Out of anyone,

22:50.168 --> 22:54.206
Charlotte knows exactly what buttons
to press to get me fucking angry.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.708
I came back
to this stupid fucking house

22:56.775 --> 22:58.977
with a stupid prick who lies

22:59.044 --> 23:01.246
and is so clever
with whatever he says.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.415
No-one fucking likes you, Gary.

23:03.482 --> 23:05.050
You're a fucking prick.

23:05.984 --> 23:07.853
(Sophie) Hey! Stop it.

23:07.919 --> 23:12.224
I have this effect on him. As soon
as I say something he doesn't like,

23:12.290 --> 23:14.126
he flips out and he's hit the lamp.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.329
Gary, control yourself now. Don't.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.131
Now he's kicking the wardrobe.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.235
This isn't a happy family.

23:24.469 --> 23:26.638
It's all just pretend.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.509
(sighs)

23:35.647 --> 23:38.817
It's our last day,
so we're gonna go out in style.

23:38.884 --> 23:42.988
If I don't piss, sick on myself
or shit myself, I won't be happy.

23:43.054 --> 23:45.290
To having
the best month of our lives.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.125
(all cheer)

23:47.192 --> 23:48.627
I love Charlotte to bits.

23:48.693 --> 23:50.328
(whoops)
Never let go.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.898
I do still have feelings for him.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.934
I'm just hoping
Holly doesn't try and grab me cock.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.269
You get the fuck to bed.

23:57.335 --> 24:01.006
He needs to watch his fucking mouth.
Fuck off!

24:01.072 --> 24:03.475
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:20.992 --> 24:23.962
I've woken up
and my eyes are like sheep's vaginas.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.564
I can barely see out of them.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.333
I've been crying over James
and I'm like, fuck.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.868
I hope he doesn't know.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.505
(Scott) I was smashed.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.140
It's fucked up, this.

24:35.207 --> 24:39.411
Me and Gaz are still getting the
same shit off Charlotte and Holly

24:39.477 --> 24:41.346
and we're not even banging them.

24:43.648 --> 24:45.050
(boys laugh)

24:46.151 --> 24:50.422
The thing with Gary is,
I say that I hate him all the time.

24:50.488 --> 24:54.259
And at times, I think I do.
I really think the hatred is real.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.629
But other times I know it's
just because I'm in love with him.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.734
Are you back with him?
I don't know.

25:02.801 --> 25:06.638
Sophie and Joel broke up last night.
I think.

25:06.705 --> 25:10.008
I was so angry, but now I just feel
so calm about it.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.143
But do you know what?
It's me last day.

25:12.210 --> 25:15.480
I don't want to think about Joel
for the rest of me time here.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.749
All I want to do is go out
and have fun.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.317
(phone rings)

25:22.120 --> 25:24.923
Hello? "Hi. Good morning.
It's Anna. Who's that?"

25:24.990 --> 25:26.258
It's Dan.

25:26.324 --> 25:29.461
"Dan, listen, I've got
a boat party planned for you all."

25:29.527 --> 25:32.931
Yeah? "Get everybody
all fired up for that and have fun."

25:32.998 --> 25:35.934
"All right, then. Thank you."
Thank you, Anna. Bye.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.740
It's our last day.
We're gonna go out in style.

25:41.806 --> 25:43.575
We're having a boat party.

25:43.642 --> 25:47.045
All our friends are gonna be there.
It's gonna be unbelievable.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.414
Speak now.

25:49.481 --> 25:52.517
I've got nothing to say.
You're speaking now.

25:54.386 --> 25:58.256
If I don't piss, sick on myself
or shit myself, I won't be happy.

25:58.323 --> 26:00.325
Right, so are you going to do that?

26:00.392 --> 26:03.194
If you've got anything to say,
don't say anything.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.530
And then that's it.

26:05.597 --> 26:07.465
We go home tomorrow.

26:07.532 --> 26:11.069
Me and Gary haven't sorted
things out, so it's a bit awkward.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.305
Won't stop me
from having a good time.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.147
We get on the boat
and my mates are there.

26:22.213 --> 26:26.084
I'm absolutely buzzing to see them.
Tonight is going to be epic.

26:31.489 --> 26:33.091
Nice seeing you, boys.

26:33.158 --> 26:36.494
Cheers. Here's to a wicked night.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.571
There's me cock. There you go.
Play the flute.

26:46.638 --> 26:49.107
I'm filling the lads in
on what it's like.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.643
No surprise to them.
They know what I'm like.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.845
Like, it's fucking... It's insane.

26:59.317 --> 27:02.721
Gary wants to speak to us.
I don't have anything to say to him,

27:02.787 --> 27:05.223
so I don't know
what this is gonna entail.

27:06.191 --> 27:07.826
You know, it's weird.
What?

27:07.892 --> 27:09.027
Just us.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.130
It is weird.
How is it weird?

27:12.197 --> 27:14.766
Cos we just can't win or lose.

27:14.833 --> 27:19.204
For me, we fell out. We made up.
We banged. We fell out.

27:19.270 --> 27:21.573
We made up. We're in love.
Everything.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.775
We what?
I don't know what I said there.

27:23.842 --> 27:26.678
You just said...
We were in love.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.680
I do love Charlotte to bits.

27:28.747 --> 27:31.716
I do want to be around her
and spend time with her.

27:31.783 --> 27:35.120
I never want to hurt her,
so it's hard to find a happy medium.

27:35.186 --> 27:37.322
It's never, ever, ever going to end.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.358
It's frustrating.
But why is it frustrating, Gary?

27:40.425 --> 27:41.960
It's just a circle.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.496
We'll go round and round
and fucking round.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.765
I don't know
if there's any getting off.

27:46.831 --> 27:50.602
Do you know what I think is strange?
We're not even fuck buddies.

27:50.668 --> 27:53.605
We've got all the negatives
of a relationship.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.641
So, are we fuck buddies?
No, we're not having sex.

27:56.708 --> 28:00.245
Does that mean we're just buddies?
No, cos he doesn't talk to us.

28:00.311 --> 28:01.813
Oh, Charlotte.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.049
What are we gonna do?

28:06.317 --> 28:09.187
We'll just get pissed
and see what happens.

28:09.254 --> 28:11.723
I think me and Gary will
never be over.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.225
I had a boyfriend
and stuff still happened.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.027
Put your feet forward.

28:16.094 --> 28:18.863
I'm trying to re-enact
a very romantic moment.

28:19.931 --> 28:22.367
Whoa, no! Just down there.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.737
I feel like we're just swinging
in the air like two monkeys.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.372
I'm holding you, man.

28:27.439 --> 28:29.240
Swinging from branch to branch.

28:29.307 --> 28:31.409
(whoops)
Never let go, Charlotte.

28:31.476 --> 28:33.845
They don't know where they're going.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.947
They don't know whether to shag.

28:36.014 --> 28:37.916
Come here. High five.

28:46.524 --> 28:48.927
James comes over
and asks for a word with me.

28:48.993 --> 28:50.328
I'm like, fuck.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.064
I'm gonna have to tell him
what I was crying about

28:53.131 --> 28:55.200
and admit I do have feelings for him.

28:55.266 --> 28:57.368
It's making me feel sick.

28:57.435 --> 28:59.137
I do want to speak to her.

28:59.204 --> 29:01.439
I want to make sure she's all right.

29:01.506 --> 29:05.543
Everyone seemed to be emotional last
night. I didn't know why you were.

29:05.610 --> 29:06.845
Like...

29:08.279 --> 29:10.815
It's really hard
to put this into words.

29:10.882 --> 29:13.084
Right.
But, like...

29:14.152 --> 29:17.021
Cos, obviously, with me and you,

29:17.088 --> 29:20.125
it's like we are good friends
and we are really close.

29:20.191 --> 29:24.129
I've sat back and watched him
and I have felt like I've been OK.

29:24.195 --> 29:28.733
And then it's just now at the end,
I feel like I've dropped me guard.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.570
Like, I didn't still want
to have these feelings for you,

29:32.637 --> 29:36.107
but, like, it's hard because
I am genuinely happy for you.

29:36.174 --> 29:40.812
I'm not OK and I know for a fact that
he's never gonna say it back to me.

29:40.879 --> 29:43.948
I know nothing ever could come of it
and I knew that.

29:45.383 --> 29:47.685
I don't like seeing Holly upset

29:47.752 --> 29:50.755
or hearing her tell us
she's still got feelings for us.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.225
I've moved on.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.927
There's nothing I can do.

30:02.867 --> 30:05.303
I see Holly on the boat
and she's crying.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.007
She's one of them girls who puts
a brave face on

30:09.073 --> 30:10.708
and hides behind her smile.

30:10.775 --> 30:15.580
Who knows what's going to happen
in the future? We don't ever know.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.982
I know exactly how Holly feels.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.284
All lads are dicks.

30:19.350 --> 30:20.985
Even my boyfriend's a cock.

30:21.052 --> 30:23.254
But us girls have
got to stick together.

30:23.321 --> 30:26.724
We all love each other so much.
Let's just fucking get pissed.

30:26.791 --> 30:29.961
Right now I can't believe
that this experience is over

30:30.028 --> 30:33.698
and the only thing we can do now
is go out with a massive bang.

30:33.765 --> 30:36.534
Let's go get mortal in Florita's!

30:36.601 --> 30:37.669
(cheering)

30:48.813 --> 30:51.683
We get to Florita's.
It's our last night.

30:51.749 --> 30:54.719
We're getting absolutely mortal.

30:54.786 --> 30:59.224
To all the friends being here and to
having the best month of our lives!

30:59.290 --> 31:00.825
(all cheer)

31:08.166 --> 31:10.868
It's my last night.
I've done enough pulling.

31:10.935 --> 31:14.706
I'm gonna chill out with me mates
and have a laugh with this family.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.944
So I'm in the club
and I spot Yabber.

31:20.011 --> 31:23.114
This is the boy
I've apparently slept with.

31:27.151 --> 31:30.321
She wants to get it clear
that they didn't have sex

31:30.388 --> 31:32.890
and she wants
to set the record straight.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.767
The boy himself is denying them
and I'm denying them,

31:42.834 --> 31:45.069
cos nothing fucking happened.

31:48.172 --> 31:51.342
It's our last night. All our family
and all the friends.

31:51.409 --> 31:55.013
It's like being at a wedding.
I'm having a fucking mint night.

31:55.079 --> 31:57.382
Everywhere I turn,
fucking Dan's there.

31:57.448 --> 31:59.984
He follows us round
like a lost fucking sheep.

32:01.252 --> 32:04.455
Dan has just tried too hard to fit in
since he came here.

32:04.522 --> 32:05.823
He's pissing us off now.

32:06.924 --> 32:10.962
We're leaving and I can just tell
that there's tension going on.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.768
Normally I can take a joke,

32:16.834 --> 32:19.504
but Scott and Gaz have pissed me off
too much.

32:19.570 --> 32:20.838
What is he doing, man?

32:20.905 --> 32:22.540
(girl) Shut up.
I'm fine!

32:22.607 --> 32:23.941
I didn't start with you!

32:24.008 --> 32:26.144
I'm in the taxi.
I'm absolutely mortal.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.046
I just snap. I've had enough.

32:28.112 --> 32:30.848
Go on!
I told you in person.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.917
You're pissed.
You need to go to bed.

32:32.984 --> 32:35.687
I'm not pissed.
Yes, you are. Stop being stupid.

32:35.753 --> 32:38.623
It's all kicked off
between Dan, Scott and Gaz.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.825
I think the kid's
finally had enough.

32:40.892 --> 32:44.228
Dan! Dan!
You're gonna get a massive argument.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.798
We get back to the house
and Dan is kicking off.

32:46.864 --> 32:50.735
He's young, he's pissed, but he needs
to watch his fucking mouth.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.603
No, you get the fuck to bed, mate.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.405
You get the fuck to bed, mate.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.341
Don't mug me off.

32:56.407 --> 32:58.843
So, Dan's got
his huffy knickers on again.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.079
He's kicking off for no reason.

33:01.145 --> 33:04.682
He's going out exactly the same way
as he came in. Like a mug.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.086
(Sophie) Hey! Don't fucking do that!

33:08.152 --> 33:10.488
Why don't you fuck off?!

33:10.555 --> 33:14.492
We treat Dan like a little brother
that you want to wind up and torture

33:14.559 --> 33:16.427
and Dan's just taking it to heart.

33:16.494 --> 33:18.963
I've tried me hardest
to get on with the boys.

33:19.030 --> 33:21.332
Why have you tried?
Why are you bothered?

33:21.399 --> 33:23.201
I'm in a house with four boys.

33:23.267 --> 33:25.903
He feels like
he's been left out from day one.

33:25.970 --> 33:28.539
He isn't part of the Bucking Squad
or the boys

33:28.606 --> 33:31.776
and he's not part of the family.
Deep down, he is.

33:34.545 --> 33:38.649
So, I got far too drunk, kicked off.
I never wanted it to end like this.

33:38.716 --> 33:41.052
I just hope I haven't
fucked things up.

33:41.119 --> 33:42.920
Do you want me to shut the window?

33:42.987 --> 33:44.088
I've put Dan to bed.

33:44.155 --> 33:46.524
He's drunk, he's emotional,

33:46.591 --> 33:49.193
but I'm sure everything
will be fine tomorrow.

33:53.131 --> 33:56.100
The party's gonna continue
in the whirlpool.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.870
(all) One, two, three.
Last night!

34:00.004 --> 34:02.440
So, we're in the hot tub.
It's like old times.

34:02.507 --> 34:03.574
(shrieks)

34:03.641 --> 34:05.943
Shock,
Charlotte and Gaz are flirting.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.478
You're not naked.
You've got clothes on.

34:08.545 --> 34:11.482
No, but yeah. But when I lift me leg,
me fanny's out.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.252
I know. I know. I've got you.

34:15.585 --> 34:16.754
(yells)

34:22.927 --> 34:25.029
Me and Holly are back to friends.

34:25.096 --> 34:27.197
She's chasing us around the table.

34:28.733 --> 34:32.637
And obviously, in my drunken state,
the first person I go to is James

34:32.703 --> 34:34.972
and obviously try
and strip him naked.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.876
(Scott) She's definitely
after a sausage.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.880
(James) What a way
to end Geordie Shore.

34:43.947 --> 34:45.683
I'm running around naked,

34:45.750 --> 34:48.786
just hoping Holly doesn't try
and grab me cock.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.054
(shrieks)

34:51.121 --> 34:54.792
This is just your average night
in the Geordie Shore house.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.399
This isn't going to end up
like I want it to.

35:01.466 --> 35:04.869
It's not going to end up
with me in his bed, cuddling him.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.038
Goodnight.
Yeah. We're friends.

35:12.276 --> 35:15.446
I'm just so emotional
and me head's just fucked.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.215
(cries)

35:19.884 --> 35:21.819
We are all leaving today.

35:21.886 --> 35:23.855
I'm gonna get really emotional.

35:23.921 --> 35:26.224
No more
of this boy-girl divide shit.

35:26.290 --> 35:28.693
We can still keep the friendship.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.628
I'm trying to get it out of him.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.196
Will we ever have sex again?

35:32.263 --> 35:33.865
Jump.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.967
I don't understand.

35:36.033 --> 35:39.403
He saw, he bucked
and he fucking conquered.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.973
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

36:05.663 --> 36:08.733
This is the last day
of Geordie Shore.

36:08.799 --> 36:10.601
We are all leaving today.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.571
We're going home, you know?
(Scott) I don't want to.

36:13.638 --> 36:17.441
This is the first time
it's been the day of going home

36:17.508 --> 36:19.477
and no-one wants to leave.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.612
We've been through
so much this time.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.283
We've had massive arguments.
We all fell out. We've all made up.

36:25.349 --> 36:28.786
It's just weird that it's all came
to an end again.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.955
How are you, Holly?
Your head hurting?

36:32.790 --> 36:34.759
I am really sad to be leaving

36:34.825 --> 36:38.362
cos I'm not going to wake up
every morning with the girls there.

36:38.429 --> 36:41.365
We're not going to have chats
about the night before.

36:41.432 --> 36:45.336
We're not going to walk downstairs,
cringing with embarrassment.

36:45.403 --> 36:47.305
There he is.
All right?

36:47.371 --> 36:49.173
Aye. Are you all right?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.509
Aye, I'm all right. I'm hanging.

36:51.576 --> 36:54.679
I bet you are. Fucking kicking off,
you, last night.

36:54.745 --> 36:58.449
Me and Scott might have
got on better from the start.

36:58.516 --> 37:02.386
Dan's like a little brother. What
brother does not get on your tits?

37:02.453 --> 37:03.988
Well, I am genuinely sorry.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.624
Everyone gets in arguments
when they're drunk.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.759
Dan's all right. He's just a kid.

37:08.826 --> 37:11.529
Of course he wants
to hang with the big boys.

37:11.596 --> 37:14.198
All I wanted to do
is get on with everybody.

37:14.265 --> 37:16.400
(Dan) This is what happens
in families.

37:16.467 --> 37:19.403
You fight, you argue,
but you're still one family.

37:19.470 --> 37:20.504
Right.

37:20.571 --> 37:24.041
It's time to pack.
Geordie Shore is over.

37:24.108 --> 37:27.445
It's been so different this time
with the two new lads

37:27.511 --> 37:29.246
and I've enjoyed every minute.

37:30.514 --> 37:32.984
I don't want to go.
I could stay here forever.

37:33.050 --> 37:35.119
I could just buck the floor through.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.357
(Holly) I feel like I've got
a proper family.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.860
Even after everything,
we're still so close together.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.795
Nothing will ever break us up.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.666
It's the end of another era.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.436
The more time I spend with him,
the more I start to like him again

37:52.503 --> 37:54.705
and it's always gonna happen.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.907
Do you think
we'll ever have sex again?

37:59.076 --> 38:02.013
I'm pleased me and Charlotte
have been the way we are.

38:02.079 --> 38:05.049
She didn't know
if she wanted to be there or not.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.618
I stayed away,
then we got more friends,

38:07.685 --> 38:09.820
the feelings came back,
we had a laugh.

38:09.887 --> 38:12.490
I've enjoyed
the way we did things this time.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.960
(Sophie) All I've done this time
is laugh.

38:16.027 --> 38:17.695
I've enjoyed myself so much.

38:17.762 --> 38:21.499
I haven't cared about Joel this time
or cried over him or missed him.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.768
I couldn't give a fuck. I'm happy.

38:23.834 --> 38:26.604
This is Geordie Shore.
I love everyone in it.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.639
It's been an amazing experience.

38:28.706 --> 38:33.144
{\an5}Shout for one of the boys.
Lads, will one of you give us a
hand?

38:37.948 --> 38:39.150
Thank you.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.320
(doorbell rings)

38:43.387 --> 38:46.824
So, we're all going
and the dreaded doorbell rings.

38:46.891 --> 38:48.325
Oh!

38:50.327 --> 38:52.863
But thank fuck. It's me dad.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.532
He's there to take us home.

38:55.433 --> 38:59.570
Nobody will ever understand what
it's like to live with them people,

38:59.637 --> 39:02.573
to behave the way we do
and enjoy ourselves so much,

39:02.640 --> 39:04.341
unless you were in that house.

39:04.408 --> 39:06.143
Look after yourself.

39:06.210 --> 39:09.080
I feel like we became
very, very close to the boys,

39:09.146 --> 39:10.614
which has never happened.

39:10.681 --> 39:15.186
I feel so sad. That feels so sad.
It's emotional, isn't it?

39:16.887 --> 39:20.224
I always cry, right,
and I'm not gonna cry now.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.493
Oh, no!

39:23.594 --> 39:27.598
Living in the Geordie Shore house
has been a life-changing experience.

39:27.665 --> 39:28.999
We've had up and downs.

39:29.066 --> 39:32.737
We've had so many big fights
and make-ups and that sort of thing.

39:32.803 --> 39:35.706
To be fair, I'm walking
away with a whole new family.

39:35.773 --> 39:40.044
I'll probably still miss Dan,
cos as annoying as he is sometimes,

39:40.111 --> 39:43.314
he is like a little brother
and you want to look after him.

39:44.281 --> 39:47.017
You were such a good addition
to the house, Scott.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.552
You think?
Yeah.

39:49.687 --> 39:52.189
I think I've
brought everyone together.

39:52.256 --> 39:54.692
No more
of this boy-girl divide shit.

39:54.759 --> 39:55.960
See you later, babe.

39:56.026 --> 39:59.697
I'm gonna miss everyone
in the house, especially Gaz,

39:59.764 --> 40:02.066
second in command of the Buck Squad.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.801
It's been emotional.

40:03.868 --> 40:06.203
Keep bucking!
(all laugh)

40:06.270 --> 40:07.671
We always keep bucking.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.642
We were joined at the hip
for the whole time.

40:11.709 --> 40:15.412
We banged birds. We had banter.
We did everything together.

40:15.479 --> 40:18.449
I couldn't have wished
for a better person to come in.

40:18.516 --> 40:19.683
See you in a bit.

40:19.750 --> 40:21.051
Bye, Scott.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.387
Scotty T came
to the Geordie Shore house.

40:23.454 --> 40:27.057
He saw, he bucked
and he fucking conquered.

40:27.124 --> 40:30.027
I can't wave and whirl
at the same time.

40:31.328 --> 40:35.199
It's been insane. We're like
one big, fucked-up family.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.668
Do you want a lift, or...
Yeah, OK.

40:37.735 --> 40:39.537
Come on, Hol.

40:39.603 --> 40:40.938
In a bit, man.
Oh, no.

40:41.005 --> 40:43.607
I feel like I'm gonna get
really emotional now.

40:43.674 --> 40:46.143
Nah. None of this in the car.

40:46.210 --> 40:48.846
Obviously I'm gonna miss the girls
so much,

40:48.913 --> 40:51.515
but the person I'm gonna
miss the most is James.

40:53.184 --> 40:56.854
Even though we're not sleeping
together and don't have that bond,

40:56.921 --> 40:59.156
I feel like I'm so close to him
as a friend

40:59.223 --> 41:01.058
and I never ever want to lose him.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.726
Over again.

41:04.395 --> 41:06.363
Bye!
Bye! Love you.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.667
It's just me and you now, Char.

41:09.733 --> 41:11.335
We are best friends.

41:11.402 --> 41:14.605
You don't have to bang.
You can still keep the friendship.

41:14.672 --> 41:16.106
I really do like the girl.

41:16.173 --> 41:20.544
I care for her as a friend and I'll
never ever stop being her friend.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.849
You never want to cuddle us.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.483
No-one's here now.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.686
Come on. You wanted a cuddle.

41:28.752 --> 41:30.721
I love it when me and Charlotte joke.

41:30.788 --> 41:33.691
How do you know which way
we're going? Left.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.061
Everyone knows I love that girl.

41:37.127 --> 41:40.998
Like her laugh. The way she smiles.
It does make us happy.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.803
Come on. Give me a hug.

41:45.870 --> 41:48.772
So, I'm saying goodbye to Gary
and it's so hard.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.407
It always is hard.

41:50.474 --> 41:51.675
Kiss.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.478
Another one.
No.

41:54.545 --> 41:56.814
Come here, now.
No. Why?

41:56.881 --> 41:58.682
No, Gary.
Jump.

41:59.650 --> 42:00.751
Give us a kiss.

42:06.390 --> 42:08.158
Gary's just kissed us.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.394
Bye.

42:12.429 --> 42:15.966
Oh, no. Oh, no.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.103
I would like to think
that Gary did really care about us.

42:19.169 --> 42:20.571
You can just never tell.

42:20.638 --> 42:23.407
He'll never give anything away.

42:24.842 --> 42:27.244
I can't believe
that I kissed him back.

42:27.311 --> 42:28.913
What the fuck does it mean?

42:30.214 --> 42:34.184
He says he doesn't like us. He says
he doesn't like us all the time.

42:34.251 --> 42:36.020
So why has he kissed us?

42:36.086 --> 42:37.922
I don't understand.

42:37.988 --> 42:40.824
It's just us now,
Scramble and Egg.

42:40.891 --> 42:44.528
The thing I love about Charlotte
is she can lift anyone's spirits.

42:44.595 --> 42:47.598
Put that girl in a room with you
and you'll be laughing.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.433
You'll be having a mint time.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.505
She doesn't care what she looks like
or what anyone thinks.

42:54.571 --> 42:56.840
She's this bubble of Charlotte Land.

42:56.907 --> 43:00.044
And when you're a part of it,
it's an amazing land to be in.

43:00.110 --> 43:02.179
What the hell has happened?

43:02.246 --> 43:05.616
The only things I've got left
is Scramble and Egg

43:05.683 --> 43:09.653
and they aren't good to talk to
when you need advice.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.722
They don't even talk back.

43:14.558 --> 43:17.161
This could just mean
fucking anything.

43:17.227 --> 43:18.963
The world is our oyster.

43:20.531 --> 43:22.266
God.
