WEBVTT

00:00.678 --> 00:02.303
That's Ronny Proxin.

00:02.386 --> 00:03.428
He's feeling my wife.

00:03.511 --> 00:06.052
If you get rid of him,
all of this goes away.

00:06.761 --> 00:07.803
What?!

00:09.136 --> 00:10.386
I've been sent here

00:10.469 --> 00:12.511
by Detective John Loach
to kill you.

00:12.595 --> 00:14.636
I'm not gonna do that.

00:15.636 --> 00:17.761
Dad?

00:18.011 --> 00:19.636
That was Ronny's daughter.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.886
I think he trains her

00:20.969 --> 00:22.720
'cause she was like
a feral mongoose.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.261
- Ronny.
- Loach!

00:34.344 --> 00:36.052
Shots fired! Shots fired!

00:36.553 --> 00:37.636
He's dead.

00:38.261 --> 00:40.428
Barry. Buddy, we have to go!

00:48.761 --> 00:50.553
Detective John Loach
was integral

00:50.636 --> 00:53.094
to a number of high-profile
gang-related cases.

00:53.177 --> 00:54.886
However, our investigation
has concluded

00:54.969 --> 00:57.720
this was a domestic matter
between Detective Loach
and another man,

00:57.803 --> 01:00.386
unrelated to police business.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.553
Newsman:
Do you have an ID
on the second man?

01:02.636 --> 01:04.510
Yes, I believe we have a photo.

01:04.595 --> 01:05.845
Woman:.

01:05.927 --> 01:07.469
Newswoman:
Is that Ronny Proxin?

01:07.553 --> 01:11.386
Yes. Mr. Proxin was a two-time
Olympic medalist in tae kwon do.

01:11.469 --> 01:15.136
Apparently,
Detective Loach's wife, Diana,

01:15.219 --> 01:17.595
had recently left him
to date Ronny.

01:19.553 --> 01:21.553
So, you get it.

01:21.636 --> 01:23.386
Newsman:
Yeah, I get it.

01:25.720 --> 01:27.177
His laptop? His files?

01:27.261 --> 01:30.177
There's nothing here.
Where would he have left it all?

01:30.261 --> 01:31.845
Diana:
I don't know.

01:33.636 --> 01:36.678
Diana...

01:36.761 --> 01:38.261
You're going through
a rough time,

01:38.344 --> 01:40.803
but you're gonna
get through it.
I just know it.

01:40.886 --> 01:43.052
And I'm sure there's a site

01:43.136 --> 01:46.761
for people whose
ex and boyfriend
murdered each other.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.595
And if there isn't,
there should be.

01:48.678 --> 01:51.261
Well, thanks for
letting me look around.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.761
Um, I can run you home.

01:53.845 --> 01:55.303
Or why don't we get a drink?

01:55.386 --> 01:57.303
- You want to get a drink?
- No.

01:57.386 --> 01:59.529
Okay. No prob...
Hey, why don't you come
to my softball practice?

01:59.553 --> 02:02.344
- Diana: I'm not really
in the mood.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:28.386 --> 02:32.136
Looks good, right?
Thirty bucks. Heh.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.845
I am starving, man.

02:33.927 --> 02:36.595
Why don't we go to...
Why don't we go to Du-par's?

02:36.678 --> 02:37.927
Pancakes on me, yeah?

02:38.011 --> 02:40.511
Listen, now that
this Loach stuff's all done,

02:40.595 --> 02:43.261
um, I can't work
with you anymore, man.

02:43.344 --> 02:45.803
Jesus Christ.
Not this thing again. Why?

02:45.886 --> 02:48.261
Why? What have I done?
Name me one thing I done.

02:49.261 --> 02:50.595
You wore a wire.

02:51.595 --> 02:53.094
- I wore a what?
- Come on, man.

02:53.177 --> 02:54.969
I mean, you know
what you did, man.

02:55.052 --> 02:56.862
Look, you know, your head's
not in the right place.

02:56.886 --> 03:00.177
We just got our asses handed
to us by a 12-year-old.

03:00.261 --> 03:01.553
But I'm fuckin' starving.

03:01.636 --> 03:04.261
Can we go to Du-par's?
Can we eat? We'll talk about it.

03:04.344 --> 03:08.177
You sold me out,
for your own interests.

03:08.261 --> 03:10.886
I did what was best for us...
Not me, us.

03:10.969 --> 03:13.261
- Bullshit, man.
- Bullsh... You're not thinking.

03:13.344 --> 03:15.511
There is no way
you can negotiate

03:15.595 --> 03:16.945
a piece of Hank's
heroin without me.

03:16.969 --> 03:18.803
Hank's heroin? I don't
give a shit about that!

03:18.886 --> 03:21.720
See, this is what
I'm talking about!
You don't fuckin' know me!

03:21.803 --> 03:23.219
You don't fuckin' know me.

03:23.303 --> 03:26.261
Mr. Cous... Mr. Cousineau,
he understands me, okay?

03:26.344 --> 03:27.511
He accepts me.

03:27.595 --> 03:29.261
Mr. Cousineau?
You know, he gets you

03:29.344 --> 03:32.094
-because you told him
about Korengal.
-Yeah.

03:35.803 --> 03:37.761
Did you tell him
you killed his girlfriend?

03:43.636 --> 03:45.344
That-that never
needs to come up.

03:45.428 --> 03:47.553
Yeah, Barry, you're in denial.

03:47.636 --> 03:50.052
Because that Korengal shit
is fog of war.

03:50.136 --> 03:54.469
You killed Moss out
of your own self-interest.

03:54.553 --> 03:56.511
You made a choice to kill her,

03:56.595 --> 03:58.303
because you're
a violent guy, Barry.

03:58.386 --> 03:59.720
But me, I built...

03:59.803 --> 04:02.678
I built a world
where that's an asset.

04:03.595 --> 04:05.052
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

04:05.136 --> 04:07.469
Aah... You're gonna choose
that fucker over me?

04:07.553 --> 04:10.803
Well, I guess everyone's
a hero of their own story,
right?

04:10.886 --> 04:13.595
Fine, I'll just work
with Hank without you.

04:13.678 --> 04:15.052
-Work with Hank
without me?
-Yeah.

04:15.136 --> 04:17.386
Without me? What do you bring
to the table without me?

04:19.469 --> 04:20.803
What?

04:21.803 --> 04:24.553
You got nothin' without me.

04:24.636 --> 04:27.636
I am your fuckin'
business, idiot!

04:29.011 --> 04:30.136
You're out of moves.

04:30.219 --> 04:32.720
Don't you walk away
from me, Barry. We...

04:32.803 --> 04:34.553
Fucker, we got too much
on the line!

04:34.636 --> 04:36.011
Come on, man!

04:38.177 --> 04:39.386
Fuck you, Barry.

04:40.469 --> 04:42.219
Fuck you, actor boy!

04:52.678 --> 04:53.845
Hank.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.094
Akhmal, I'm getting
to your stuff, okay?

04:56.177 --> 04:57.428
Thank you, but listen.

04:57.511 --> 04:58.987
When you are done
washing monks' robes,

04:59.011 --> 05:01.803
Cristobal wants
you to fold them
and take them out to car.

05:01.886 --> 05:04.219
Okay. Why?

05:04.303 --> 05:06.636
Esther and her men
are moving back to monastery.

05:06.720 --> 05:10.761
They want to be there
when heroin shipment arrives.

05:10.845 --> 05:12.386
They are leaving us?

05:13.845 --> 05:14.886
No.

05:14.969 --> 05:16.052
Yes, Barry.

05:16.136 --> 05:19.052
I am washing Burmese
right out of my hair.

05:20.469 --> 05:23.011
Good. Good.
That's much improved.
That's good.

05:23.927 --> 05:26.386
So, the heroin shipment
is coming in two days,

05:26.469 --> 05:27.803
which means we have small window

05:27.886 --> 05:29.886
before monastery is
fully fortified to take it,

05:29.969 --> 05:31.219
just like we took stash house.

05:31.303 --> 05:33.011
Hey, what do you mean "we"?

05:33.094 --> 05:34.469
Well, we... you, me.

05:34.553 --> 05:37.136
Team Badass. Come on.
Kickin' ass, makin' names.

05:37.219 --> 05:40.177
No, the deal was,
is that I train them, that's it.

05:40.261 --> 05:41.886
Remember?

05:41.969 --> 05:43.469
That is true.
That is true.

05:43.553 --> 05:46.428
You know, that was plan,
and I'm man of my word.

05:46.511 --> 05:48.803
Okay? I am honest Gabe.

05:49.886 --> 05:52.761
So, what do
you think, though?
Are they ready?

05:59.845 --> 06:02.511
They're as ready
as they're ever gonna be.

06:02.595 --> 06:03.886
Shit, man.

06:03.969 --> 06:06.511
They're gonna be pretty
fuckin' broken up about it.

06:06.595 --> 06:10.511
I mean, they're gonna
want to say goodbye
and thank you and...

06:13.386 --> 06:16.845
Barry. Man,
you don't even know.

06:16.927 --> 06:18.636
It's about to go off.

06:22.052 --> 06:25.428
NoHo Hank:
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

06:46.011 --> 06:48.761
It means, um,
"The debt has been paid."

06:50.303 --> 06:51.678
You owe me nothing.

06:51.761 --> 06:54.803
And, slate is clean, right?

06:58.011 --> 07:01.595
And just because we're not
working together anymore...

07:03.969 --> 07:05.386
Are you fucking serious?

07:05.469 --> 07:07.219
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

07:07.303 --> 07:09.344
You just fucked this moment,

07:09.428 --> 07:12.094
this beautiful, tender moment
with your accordion.

07:12.177 --> 07:15.344
You just whipped out
your accordion,
and you fucked it, man.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.636
God!

07:19.136 --> 07:21.056
- Hey, I'm so sorry about that.
- It's all right.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.052
Um, where was I?

07:23.136 --> 07:24.969
Aah, it's gone. It's gone.

07:25.052 --> 07:26.927
Yeah. Gone.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.344
Where'd you park?

07:30.511 --> 07:33.386
Barry, do you still have

07:33.469 --> 07:35.261
special Chechen bullet
I gave you?

07:35.344 --> 07:37.987
Because I think it would be
a real gas for me to use it
to kill Esther.

07:38.011 --> 07:39.595
I didn't bring it.

07:39.678 --> 07:42.386
All right. Well...

07:42.469 --> 07:44.678
Normal bullet is cool, too.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.469
I wanted to say thank you
for pushing me.

07:51.553 --> 07:54.052
Before you, I was small.

07:54.136 --> 07:55.511
I had nothing.

07:55.595 --> 07:59.595
You know, when they look
at me, they... they see nobody.

07:59.678 --> 08:01.845
But now,

08:01.927 --> 08:04.678
I have a purpose.

08:04.761 --> 08:06.052
You gave me that.

08:11.386 --> 08:14.927
- Take care of yourself, Barry.
- Stay off the 405, man.

08:27.303 --> 08:30.927
"So, this is an absolutely
true story that happened
to me.

08:31.011 --> 08:35.010
"When I was six or seven,
I was at home, at my mum's
flat in London,

08:35.094 --> 08:38.510
"and I looked
out of the window,
and I saw

08:38.595 --> 08:40.260
"a horse,

08:40.344 --> 08:42.760
right outside
my block of flats."

08:48.927 --> 08:51.845
- And?
- That's my story.

08:51.927 --> 08:55.595
And you think that that moment
is the moment that defines you?

08:56.636 --> 08:58.969
Gene, I didn't grow up around...

08:59.052 --> 09:00.469
a lot of animals, like you lot.

09:00.553 --> 09:03.136
Right? Like I'm... I'm not
from like a rural place.

09:03.219 --> 09:04.845
This is in the middle of a city.

09:04.927 --> 09:06.720
All right, thank you.
Thank you, Sasha.

09:07.761 --> 09:09.803
No don't...
No, no, no! Don't clap.

09:09.886 --> 09:11.737
You lot... you lot should've
applauded at the end.

09:11.761 --> 09:13.344
If you clap now,
it's like pitiful.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.779
Natalie:
We didn't know
it was over.

09:14.803 --> 09:16.279
Gene:
Okay, Sasha,
there are people waiting.

09:16.303 --> 09:17.987
Sasha:
Maybe you didn't know
it was over, but...

09:18.011 --> 09:20.177
could you tell that horse
was a big deal to me?

09:20.261 --> 09:23.261
Because it was.
I mean, I stood up here
and told that story.

09:32.303 --> 09:34.136
Hey. We're up next.
What's going on?

09:35.678 --> 09:37.219
I rewrote my scene.

09:37.303 --> 09:38.469
Yeah?

09:39.636 --> 09:41.011
Barry, look, I'm really sorry

09:41.094 --> 09:42.320
that I didn't
tell you this before,

09:42.344 --> 09:43.927
but after we had
dinner with Sam,

09:44.011 --> 09:46.720
he called me, and, um...

09:46.803 --> 09:48.219
I went to his hotel.

09:48.303 --> 09:51.052
- What?
- God, no.
Nothing happened, I promise.

09:51.136 --> 09:54.011
No, it wasn't like that
at all. No, it was...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.428
awful, actually.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.219
I just... I couldn't
stand up to him.

09:57.303 --> 09:58.821
I don't know, I just
felt fucking paralyzed,

09:58.845 --> 10:00.428
like I was fucking
19 years old again.

10:00.511 --> 10:02.886
Like, I stood there like
a fucking idiot, and I just...

10:02.969 --> 10:04.636
I don't know what
I thought. I thought...

10:04.720 --> 10:05.821
I thought it'd be different,

10:05.845 --> 10:06.987
or I thought I'd
be different, or...

10:07.011 --> 10:09.011
But I just... He's got my number.

10:09.094 --> 10:11.177
So, I wrote this.

10:11.261 --> 10:13.595
- It's the truth.
- Yeah, no, I can see that.

10:13.678 --> 10:16.136
Sally: I don't know.
I... I don't know
if I can do this.

10:16.219 --> 10:19.428
I mean, I can barely talk
about this stuff with you.

10:19.511 --> 10:21.237
How am I supposed
to get up there and just...

10:21.261 --> 10:23.553
And just like say all of this
in front of them?

10:23.636 --> 10:25.011
I mean, what if they judge me?

10:25.094 --> 10:26.511
What if they don't
fucking get it?

10:26.595 --> 10:28.469
No, no.
Hey, listen, Sally.

10:29.678 --> 10:31.927
I think...

10:32.011 --> 10:34.969
if you can tell the truth,
you should.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.177
Telling the truth's
a good thing.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.052
Barry:
"Everybody was staring at you.
I don't like it.

10:43.136 --> 10:45.469
It was embarrassing.
You looked like a whore."

10:45.553 --> 10:48.136
Sally:
Sam, Ken is just a friend.
Don't be an idiot.

10:48.219 --> 10:50.511
Barry:
"Don't call me
a fucking idiot."

10:50.595 --> 10:54.636
"Sam grabs Sally by the throat,
pins her against the wall.

10:54.720 --> 10:59.469
"Sally stares at him wild-eyed,
gasps for air. None comes.

10:59.553 --> 11:02.636
"He's going to kill her.
Finally, Sam lets go.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.845
"Sally slumps to the floor,
fighting for air.

11:05.927 --> 11:07.803
Sam paces. Then..."

11:07.886 --> 11:11.303
"I'm... I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I did that to you.

11:11.386 --> 11:13.886
"I'm so sorry. It's just,
seeing you with someone else,

11:13.969 --> 11:16.219
"I got so jealous.
And you're right,
I'm an idiot.

11:16.303 --> 11:17.595
I'm such a fucking idiot."

11:17.678 --> 11:20.386
"No, you're not.
It's my fault.

11:20.469 --> 11:22.803
"Look, I'm sorry
that I called you that.

11:24.428 --> 11:26.177
I love you."

11:26.261 --> 11:27.886
"I love you, too.

11:29.386 --> 11:31.344
And I'm never gonna do
this again, I promise."

11:31.428 --> 11:33.386
"I know. No, I know."

11:34.595 --> 11:37.636
Gene:
"They embrace.
Sally turns to the audience.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.386
A spotlight returns to her."

11:39.469 --> 11:43.136
Yeah, so, this next bit would be
sort of like a direct address.

11:47.219 --> 11:50.511
"He apologizes, like before.

11:50.595 --> 11:53.469
"And I will never feel more
loved than in that moment.

11:53.553 --> 11:56.927
"I endure the wrath because
I know what comes after.

11:57.011 --> 11:58.678
"It's a cycle I can't break,

11:58.761 --> 12:01.511
"because I want to
and I don't want to.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.803
I stay for the apology."

12:20.177 --> 12:22.219
Really, it wasn't that bad.

12:22.303 --> 12:23.553
- It wasn't that bad?
- No.

12:23.636 --> 12:25.344
Are you fucking insane?
Were you in there?

12:25.428 --> 12:27.136
I just took a giant
fucking turd out there.

12:27.219 --> 12:28.886
Look, they were expecting
the old version,

12:28.969 --> 12:30.362
and this new one just
threw them a little.

12:30.386 --> 12:32.028
- That's all that happened.
- Yeah, well...

12:32.052 --> 12:33.344
clearly I can't do this version,

12:33.428 --> 12:34.987
and now they know
the other version is a lie,

12:35.011 --> 12:37.136
so now I have no story.
So, thanks.

12:37.219 --> 12:40.553
Listen, once we rehearse it,
and-and... you perform it,

12:40.636 --> 12:43.511
they'll see that
the honest version
is really powerful.

12:45.136 --> 12:47.011
- Once we rehearse this?
- Yeah.

12:47.094 --> 12:49.219
You? You and me?

12:49.303 --> 12:51.886
What, you and me
are gonna do this
and it's gonna be powerful?

12:51.969 --> 12:55.136
Yeah!

13:03.094 --> 13:05.011
I teach pigs.

13:06.344 --> 13:07.428
Hey, Mr. Cousineau?

13:07.511 --> 13:10.678
Hey! How's Sally?

13:10.761 --> 13:14.428
- She's pretty embarrassed.
- Yeah, well, understandable.

13:14.511 --> 13:16.136
But I am proud of her.

13:16.219 --> 13:18.139
I mean, we were all shocked
that she had the guts

13:18.219 --> 13:19.803
to get to the emotional
place she went.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.886
Yeah, I know. Um...

13:22.969 --> 13:24.845
Look, she doesn't want to do
the scene anymore,

13:24.927 --> 13:28.678
and I think she should...
tell the truth.

13:28.761 --> 13:32.344
So, um, I want to put
my energy into playing Sam

13:32.428 --> 13:34.969
and not do my own piece.

13:35.052 --> 13:37.595
- Is that okay?
- Okay?

13:37.678 --> 13:40.177
It is more than okay.
Because I...

13:40.261 --> 13:42.927
I don't know if you remember
this or not, but you killed...

13:43.011 --> 13:44.886
Both:
somebody
and got away with it.

13:44.969 --> 13:46.886
Yeah, no, you keep
reminding me of that.

13:46.969 --> 13:49.678
Look, I want to be good
in her scene.

13:49.761 --> 13:51.136
Um, can you help me?

13:51.219 --> 13:54.969
Of course I will.
I will always be
there for you.

13:55.052 --> 13:57.845
As long as I'm out of here
in seven minutes.

14:51.177 --> 14:52.636
Fuches:
Bingo.

14:56.469 --> 14:58.177
Here we go.

15:06.969 --> 15:10.511
What is the essential emotion
of this scene?

15:11.553 --> 15:16.511
Okay, Sam is enraged,
because Sally is withholding.

15:16.595 --> 15:20.511
He gets violent, he acts out,
then he feels shame.

15:20.595 --> 15:22.595
Sound familiar?

15:24.011 --> 15:26.219
- Korengal.
- Exactly.

15:26.303 --> 15:30.094
You don't literally
have to tell your story

15:30.177 --> 15:32.386
in order to use your story.

15:32.469 --> 15:34.428
Yeah, but I... I lost con...
Control back then,

15:34.511 --> 15:37.261
and I don't want to do that
with Sally onstage.

15:37.344 --> 15:39.969
Barry, you're the actor.

15:40.052 --> 15:44.136
You're not hurting anyone.
You're not attacking anybody.

15:44.219 --> 15:46.927
You're just lending
your emotional experience

15:47.011 --> 15:48.845
to the character of Sam.

15:48.927 --> 15:50.261
- Okay.
- Look...

15:50.344 --> 15:54.553
Sam is an inherently
violent guy. You are not.

15:54.636 --> 15:59.553
He is a horrible person.
You are not.

15:59.636 --> 16:02.927
So, in order to play him,
you've got to use

16:03.011 --> 16:05.969
the worst thing you've
ever done in your life.

16:08.303 --> 16:09.803
Yeah, no,
and that-that was the...

16:09.886 --> 16:12.011
worst thing I'd ever done
in my life.

16:12.094 --> 16:13.553
Thank Christ.

16:13.636 --> 16:16.386
Because, you know, you killed
somebody and got away with it.

16:16.469 --> 16:18.553
Okay, so, I want
you to dig deep.

16:18.636 --> 16:19.886
I want you to get in there.

16:19.969 --> 16:23.011
I want you to paddle
that canoe, there, soldier.

16:23.094 --> 16:25.428
And, Barry...

16:25.511 --> 16:28.094
- thank you.
- For what?

16:28.177 --> 16:30.177
For telling me your story.

16:30.261 --> 16:33.845
I am very touched that I was
able to gain your trust.

16:35.177 --> 16:37.886
I am so late for my escape room.

16:49.886 --> 16:52.011
-Hello?
- Hi, Sally.
It's Tom from Gersh.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.678
- I have Lindsay for you.
- Thank you.

16:54.761 --> 16:56.886
Fuck.

16:58.344 --> 17:00.320
Lindsay:
Hey, Madeleine's people
said you hadn't confirmed

17:00.344 --> 17:01.903
for two o'clock today.
Are you on your way?

17:01.927 --> 17:05.051
Hi. Hi, Lindsay. Hi... Hi.
Yeah, no, I'm really sorry.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.511
I just... I'm... I'm working
on this theater piece,

17:07.595 --> 17:09.469
and I got kind of wrapped
up in it, and I just

17:09.553 --> 17:11.720
kind of forgot.

17:11.803 --> 17:14.428
Um, I'm really sorry,
but can we just cancel?

17:14.511 --> 17:15.969
Theater piece?

17:16.051 --> 17:17.362
Sally, look,
I know it's one scene,

17:17.386 --> 17:18.511
and it is another wife,

17:18.595 --> 17:20.344
but this is
Benicio Del Toro's wife,

17:20.428 --> 17:22.051
so I'm assuming she drinks.

17:22.136 --> 17:25.386
- So, how soon can
you get there?
-Um...

17:26.553 --> 17:29.678
Yeah, I...
I can't today, Lindsay.

17:29.761 --> 17:31.881
I'm really sorry. I...
I really need to focus on this.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.469
- Okay? Thanks. Bye.
- Sal...

17:36.678 --> 17:39.303
Fuck.

17:54.011 --> 17:56.678
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

18:01.344 --> 18:04.177
Wha...? Wait, wait.

18:07.761 --> 18:09.386
Fuck.

18:18.011 --> 18:20.094
Aah!

18:29.511 --> 18:31.428
I don't know how
to tell you this, but...

18:31.511 --> 18:34.344
one of the twins smothered
the other in the womb.

18:34.428 --> 18:36.761
- Eric: Why would God
allow this to happen?

18:36.845 --> 18:38.136
I don't... I don't know.

18:38.219 --> 18:40.845
We gotta go.
We can do the stage combat.

18:40.927 --> 18:44.261
-How do I do this?
-Hand first. Ready?
One, two, three.

18:44.344 --> 18:45.845
What is wrong?

18:45.927 --> 18:47.386
I don't want to do this!

18:47.469 --> 18:49.279
Look, the last time I did this,
they all just stared at me.

18:49.303 --> 18:51.571
It's gonna be good, all right?
I've been working really hard

18:51.595 --> 18:53.595
with Gene,
and it's gonna be great.

18:53.678 --> 18:56.219
- One more time.
- Okay, go ahead.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.803
One, two, three.

18:58.886 --> 19:00.261
Sell it.

19:00.344 --> 19:03.428
- There you go!
That was great!!

19:03.511 --> 19:05.511
Okay. Who's next?

19:07.595 --> 19:10.553
Um... Hold on.

19:10.636 --> 19:13.136
This is a bar.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.303
Um...

19:15.386 --> 19:18.011
Table, and...

19:18.094 --> 19:20.011
I'm grabbing dinner...

19:21.052 --> 19:22.927
Yeah. Okay.

19:23.927 --> 19:25.720
Shit.

19:38.052 --> 19:40.136
Why were you dancing
with that guy tonight?

19:41.469 --> 19:44.720
Ken? He's just a friend, Sam.

19:46.261 --> 19:48.595
Everybody was
staring at you.
I don't like it.

19:48.678 --> 19:51.761
It was embarrassing.
You looked like a whore.

19:51.845 --> 19:55.803
- Sam, Ken is just a friend.
Don't be an idiot.

20:00.678 --> 20:03.195
Hey, can, can I reset?
Is that all right?
Can we just take it from...

20:03.219 --> 20:05.469
Yeah. Take it
in your own time.

20:22.011 --> 20:24.803
Moss:
'Cause I'm a cop,
and you're a fuckin' murderer.

20:45.553 --> 20:48.094
It's done.

21:08.469 --> 21:10.678
Why were you dancing
with that guy tonight?

21:12.219 --> 21:14.428
Ken? He's...

21:14.511 --> 21:17.678
- He's just a friend, Sam.
- Everybody was looking at you.

21:17.761 --> 21:20.386
It was embarrassing.
I didn't like it.
You looked like a whore.

21:21.761 --> 21:24.386
Sam, don't worry about it.
Okay? Ken is just a friend.

21:24.469 --> 21:26.487
Just a friend, since when?
Since when? Who the fuck's Ken?

21:26.511 --> 21:28.595
- You met him.
- When did I meet Ken?

21:28.678 --> 21:31.386
I don't know, he's just
a friend. You're drunk.

21:31.469 --> 21:33.219
- I'm what?
- You're drunk.

21:33.303 --> 21:35.720
If Ken's such a good friend,
tell me when I met him.

21:35.803 --> 21:38.511
Tell me the day, tell me
the time, when I met Ken.

21:38.595 --> 21:40.845
-Sam, just don't
be an idiot.
-You...

21:40.927 --> 21:43.344
Don't call me a fucking idiot!

21:44.678 --> 21:46.761
What are you calling me?
You're calling me an idiot?

21:50.553 --> 21:53.761
Calling me an idiot?
That's what you want?

21:58.052 --> 21:59.094
Fuck!

22:26.595 --> 22:28.511
I'm sorry.

22:28.595 --> 22:30.761
I'm so sorry.

22:30.845 --> 22:33.428
I saw you dancing
with someone else,
and I got jealous.

22:34.469 --> 22:35.803
You're right.
I'm a fucking idiot.

22:35.886 --> 22:38.969
- No.
- I don't deserve you.

22:41.469 --> 22:43.094
I'm sorry.

22:46.553 --> 22:48.678
It's my fault.

22:48.761 --> 22:51.553
-I shouldn't have
called you that.
-No, I'm sorry.

22:53.219 --> 22:56.177
- Sally: I love you.
- Barry: I love you.

22:56.261 --> 22:59.595
-And I'm never gonna
do that again, I promise.
-I know.

23:03.595 --> 23:05.595
I hold him,

23:05.678 --> 23:09.344
and I can feel
his shame, burning.

23:11.094 --> 23:13.303
I take care of him,

23:13.386 --> 23:15.511
so my shame grows.

23:17.969 --> 23:20.094
I stay for the apology.

23:22.344 --> 23:24.261
And scene.

23:25.678 --> 23:27.553
- Are you okay?
- Hey! That was great!

23:27.636 --> 23:29.386
My God!
You were great!

23:29.469 --> 23:30.845
Yeah, I'm fine!

23:30.927 --> 23:32.571
My God, I was bit thrown
by the whole table thing.

23:32.595 --> 23:34.112
Yeah, I didn't know
if that was crazy or not.

23:34.136 --> 23:35.737
It was good.
I think I'm gonna
write that in.

23:35.761 --> 23:38.886
-Hey, Barry, can I see you
over here for a minute?
-Yeah.

23:40.969 --> 23:42.344
I have a few new ideas.

23:42.428 --> 23:45.261
Yeah. Hey, was
that all right?

23:46.469 --> 23:47.886
Really well done.

23:47.969 --> 23:51.052
Sasha:
Now that it's shorter,
like, it's so much better.

23:51.136 --> 23:53.195
Like, I feel like
the shorter scene can be
the bear it's gonna be.

23:53.219 --> 23:54.595
- Right?
- Sally: Right.

23:54.678 --> 23:57.052
- So, the cuts are good?
- Yes, don't write any more.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.428
Keep the cuts.
Never milk it. Just like...

23:59.511 --> 24:01.927
- Thanks.
- Live in what you've got.

24:02.011 --> 24:03.219
Hi.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.553
So, this is why you're
turning down auditions?

24:07.636 --> 24:10.720
Yes. My God. I'm re...
I'm so sorry about that.

24:10.803 --> 24:14.511
No, no, no, no.
Don't be. This is good.

24:14.595 --> 24:16.511
Really? Thanks.

24:16.595 --> 24:19.261
So, this is your real story?

24:19.344 --> 24:21.136
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:21.219 --> 24:22.678
Are you free tomorrow?

24:22.761 --> 24:24.821
Do you have time to come in and
sit down with me and the Mikes?

24:24.845 --> 24:27.761
- Yes, totally.
- Sorry, um, who are you?

24:27.845 --> 24:29.903
This is a closed rehearsal.
You can't audit the class.

24:29.927 --> 24:33.094
I'm so sorry. Um, I...
I'm Lindsay Mandel.

24:33.177 --> 24:34.969
I'm Sally's agent. Gersh.

24:35.052 --> 24:36.969
Enchanté.

26:05.303 --> 26:07.136
Yeah!

26:09.428 --> 26:10.886
I got you!

26:10.969 --> 26:12.720
I got you, Barry!
You motherfucker!

26:24.094 --> 26:26.136
Hank, it's go time.

26:39.553 --> 26:41.344
- The vehicles are loaded?
- Yes.

26:42.261 --> 26:44.320
And you reminded
the guys to double-knot
their boots, yes?

26:44.344 --> 26:45.821
Because I cannot
have people tripping.

26:45.845 --> 26:47.654
It's dangerous, but, you know,
it's also embarrassing.

26:47.678 --> 26:48.761
- I told them.
- Great.

26:48.845 --> 26:50.927
All right, so we have
one shot at this.

26:51.011 --> 26:53.344
We have to capture
the monastery before
the heroin arrives,

26:53.428 --> 26:56.678
or we are... fucked.

27:02.136 --> 27:03.344
Esther?

27:07.011 --> 27:08.511
Cristobal?

27:10.678 --> 27:14.595
Khazam? The fucking accordion
player sold us out?

27:14.678 --> 27:16.678
We are very disappointed
in you, Hank.

27:16.761 --> 27:18.261
Noho Hank:
Okay, in my defense...

27:26.219 --> 27:27.886
Your Chicken à la King.

27:27.969 --> 27:30.511
Thank you.

27:32.219 --> 27:34.886
- Jeffrey?
- Yeah.

27:36.303 --> 27:37.720
Take that away.

27:39.886 --> 27:42.886
Sure, Gene. Okay.

28:08.261 --> 28:11.011
Have you decided on dinner, sir?

28:11.094 --> 28:12.636
Yeah, I think so.

28:13.969 --> 28:15.636
I'll have what he's having.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.927
Okay.

29:46.344 --> 29:48.011
Come on, my friend.
Cristobal?

29:48.219 --> 29:49.927
Maybe fresh start?
You know?

29:50.011 --> 29:51.927
One-time do-over?
Mulligan?

29:52.344 --> 29:53.595
Get out of free jail?

29:54.803 --> 29:57.595
We'd like to put you in a room
with Aaron Ryan.

29:57.678 --> 29:58.886
The TV producer?

29:58.969 --> 30:01.136
There's three women.
When we meet them,

30:01.219 --> 30:03.011
they're all
in abusive relationships.

30:03.386 --> 30:05.344
- They're lost.
- That's great. I love that.

30:05.428 --> 30:07.195
So they start a group
where they kill their husbands.

30:07.219 --> 30:08.219
Jesus.

30:08.553 --> 30:10.261
An audition?

30:10.344 --> 30:11.469
- You?
- Yeah.

30:11.553 --> 30:13.344
- Have an audition?
- Yeah.

30:13.428 --> 30:14.969
What,
are they reading extras now?

30:15.052 --> 30:16.932
Man, that's so weird.
Sally said the same thing.

30:21.803 --> 30:23.123
I don't wanna talk to you
anymore.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.595
Well, I guess everyone's a hero
of their own story, right?

30:26.927 --> 30:29.177
Fine, I'll just work with Hank
without you.

30:29.386 --> 30:30.737
- Work with Hank without me?
- Yeah.

30:30.761 --> 30:33.177
Without me? What do you bring
to the table without me?

30:35.553 --> 30:38.803
This episode, we always wanted
Barry breaking up with Fuches.

30:38.886 --> 30:40.678
He finishes working
with the Chechens.

30:40.886 --> 30:43.303
It means, um,
the debt has been paid.

30:43.386 --> 30:44.303
You owe me nothing.

30:44.386 --> 30:46.595
Now, he can just finally, like,

30:46.678 --> 30:48.886
"I'm free.
I can be an actor now."

30:48.969 --> 30:50.177
That was the initial idea,

30:50.261 --> 30:52.386
and then this thing
with Sally came up.

30:52.595 --> 30:54.595
She does it.
You know, she writes the truth.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.052
It's a cycle I can't break

30:56.136 --> 30:58.177
because I want to
when I don't want to.

30:58.261 --> 31:01.094
They're all stunned
that she went that deep.

31:01.177 --> 31:03.011
She doesn't feel like
she can lie anymore,

31:03.094 --> 31:04.136
but she also...

31:04.344 --> 31:06.511
doesn't know if she has
the strength to tell the truth.

31:06.927 --> 31:08.678
I want to put my energy
into playing Sam,

31:08.761 --> 31:10.011
and not do my own piece.

31:10.094 --> 31:12.511
It is more than okay
because I... I don't know

31:12.595 --> 31:15.386
if you remember this or not,
but you killed somebody...

31:15.469 --> 31:16.678
And got away with it.

31:16.761 --> 31:18.678
Yeah, no, you keep reminding me
of that.

31:18.761 --> 31:20.219
To help Sally tell her truth,

31:20.303 --> 31:22.261
he's gonna have to draw
upon stuff

31:22.344 --> 31:23.612
that he doesn't want to look at.

31:23.636 --> 31:26.886
You don't literally
have to tell your story

31:27.177 --> 31:28.803
in order to use your story.

31:28.927 --> 31:32.845
Barry uses things from his past
to play this scene

31:32.927 --> 31:35.052
that he hasn't told
Cousineau about,

31:35.136 --> 31:37.511
and Cousineau's reaction
is to the performance.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.886
Really well done.

31:39.303 --> 31:42.720
So, you've got Cousineau,
ironically, congratulating Barry

31:42.803 --> 31:46.553
for the courage to dig deep
and draw on experiences,

31:46.636 --> 31:48.845
one of which may or may not
have been

31:48.927 --> 31:50.927
the killing
of Cousineau's own girlfriend.

31:51.011 --> 31:52.678
Mr. Cousineau,
he understands me.

31:52.761 --> 31:53.845
Okay? He accepts me.

31:53.927 --> 31:55.195
Because you told him
about Korangal.

31:55.219 --> 31:58.052
Barry does this big confession
about Korangal

31:58.136 --> 31:59.553
as the worst thing
he's ever done.

31:59.636 --> 32:00.862
He feels so much shame about it.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.529
We would be in the writer's room
and people would go,

32:02.553 --> 32:04.487
"But that's not the worst thing
he's ever done. I mean,

32:04.511 --> 32:06.303
- he fucking killed Chris.
- Right. Yeah.

32:06.386 --> 32:08.927
- You know, Moss.
- We've seen many worse things.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.553
Yeah, what is going
on here, man? You know?

32:11.636 --> 32:13.344
So we had Fuches say that.

32:13.428 --> 32:15.136
Did you tell him you killed
his girlfriend?

32:15.428 --> 32:17.927
Fuches, I think,
has been spurned by Barry.

32:18.177 --> 32:20.428
It's that thing of, like,
if we can't be together,

32:20.511 --> 32:22.595
then I'm just gonna wreck
your life.

32:22.845 --> 32:24.761
The idea of him
going out into the woods

32:24.845 --> 32:27.094
and trying to find the car
was always something

32:27.177 --> 32:29.511
that we had played with
or talked about.

32:29.595 --> 32:31.344
Fuches has always
fancied himself

32:31.428 --> 32:33.094
like this kind of military guy,

32:33.177 --> 32:35.261
- but he's just a poser.
- Yeah, and that...

32:35.344 --> 32:37.595
He gets out there, and you think
he's gonna find it,

32:37.678 --> 32:38.821
and you're kinda like, "Aw, man,

32:38.845 --> 32:40.386
he's gonna really
figure this out,"

32:40.469 --> 32:41.789
and then immediately
he gets lost.

32:44.511 --> 32:46.927
So Hank finds out that Esther
and them all left,

32:47.011 --> 32:49.469
so he's like, "Great.
Now we can attack."

32:49.553 --> 32:50.720
It's about to go off.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.219
It's one of these
comedic conceits that I love,

32:53.303 --> 32:55.344
that... that Hank picks a fight

32:55.428 --> 32:57.511
with this...
schmuck accordion player.

32:57.595 --> 33:00.011
♪ -Are you fucking serious?

33:00.761 --> 33:03.803
If you look at Bill, every time
he's in a shot with Anthony,

33:03.886 --> 33:05.571
- he's either looking down...
- I'm looking down,

33:05.595 --> 33:07.094
or I'd have my eyes closed.

33:07.177 --> 33:08.636
Are you fucking kidding me
right now?

33:08.720 --> 33:10.052
He was making me laugh so hard.

33:10.136 --> 33:11.553
And then that guy ends up

33:11.636 --> 33:13.969
being the reason
that Hank is betrayed.

33:14.052 --> 33:17.052
Kazan? The fucking
accordion player sold us out?

33:17.136 --> 33:19.428
- If he had never yelled
at the accordion player...

33:19.511 --> 33:21.177
everything
would have gone great.
