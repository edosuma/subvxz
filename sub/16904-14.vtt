WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.138
Hey.

00:02.258 --> 00:05.320
Do you have a neck pillow? I blew mine
and Alex's smells like my mouth,

00:05.862 --> 00:08.188
I never sleep on planes.
I don't want to get incepted.

00:08.741 --> 00:10.067
Are you going somewhere?

00:10.187 --> 00:11.720
Carol has a flight
to Raleigh-Durham,

00:11.721 --> 00:12.955
so I'm going with him,

00:13.023 --> 00:14.044
and we're gonna drive out
and spend a few days

00:14.045 --> 00:15.153
at an inn at Nags Head.

00:15.177 --> 00:18.629
You're going to NagsHhead?
Isn't that redundant?

00:22.187 --> 00:24.755
You're going to Nags Head?
Isn't that redundant?

00:28.701 --> 00:31.635
You will hand me an envelope
predicting my joke about Nags Head.

00:31.755 --> 00:33.034
That is solid.

00:33.154 --> 00:36.268
Avery and I are also having a
little romantic weekend together

00:36.388 --> 00:37.339
before the baby comes.

00:37.459 --> 00:39.910
We're going to Toronto
for the G-8 economic summit.

00:40.030 --> 00:41.068
It's going to be...

00:41.959 --> 00:42.966
Very erotic.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.888
Look at us, being all adult-y.

00:45.008 --> 00:47.700
I packed underwear...
That isn't gray.

00:48.042 --> 00:48.834
Isn't it nice

00:48.860 --> 00:51.146
dating someone you have so much
in common with?

00:51.480 --> 00:53.816
Like you, Avery
is a type-"A" nut job.

00:53.849 --> 00:55.584
And, of course,
you and Carol share

00:55.704 --> 00:57.051
your trademark stubbornness.

00:57.119 --> 00:58.836
We are not stubborn.
We're principled.

00:58.921 --> 01:00.054
Have a nice trip, Lemon.

01:00.122 --> 01:01.689
Break out those underpants,
but be careful.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.342
Dating yourself
is a double-edged sword.

01:04.426 --> 01:06.694
It means you also
share the same flaws.

01:06.762 --> 01:09.230
Well, that would only be
a problem if I had any flaws.

01:09.298 --> 01:10.898
Not only is your fly open,

01:10.966 --> 01:15.069
there's a pencil
sticking out of it.

01:15.137 --> 01:17.205
Good day to you, sir.

01:22.210 --> 01:32.151
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:38.344 --> 01:41.379
Tracy, congratulations
on egot-ing.

01:41.447 --> 01:44.916
You got an Emmy, a Grammy,
an Oscar, and a Tony.

01:44.984 --> 01:48.853
You are more talented than I.

01:52.692 --> 01:54.559
You're ready, mirror Jenna.

01:55.961 --> 01:58.563
Tracy, congratulations on e...

01:58.631 --> 02:00.398
The Empire State Building
will be lit

02:00.449 --> 02:01.899
in the color of your choosing.

02:01.951 --> 02:03.501
- Clear.
- Seaworld will now

02:03.569 --> 02:05.737
let you borrow a killer whale
for spring break.

02:05.805 --> 02:08.306
- I'll need a whale saddle.
- And Steven Spielberg

02:08.374 --> 02:10.074
wants you to star
in his next movie.

02:10.142 --> 02:11.276
Kate Capshaw's husband?

02:15.648 --> 02:17.182
Tracy, congratulations.

02:17.249 --> 02:19.083
I loved your acceptance speech.

02:19.135 --> 02:22.420
Tracy Jordan asked me
to accept this on his behalf

02:22.488 --> 02:25.190
- because his mouth is full.
- Pop tarts!

02:25.257 --> 02:27.925
So I guess you've
made it to "The Next Level."

02:27.977 --> 02:29.828
I look forward to seeing
how this empowers you

02:29.895 --> 02:31.129
to make my life more difficult.

02:31.197 --> 02:32.831
As am I, Liz Lemon.

02:32.898 --> 02:35.033
It'll probably involve
a guitar-playing chimpanzee

02:35.100 --> 02:36.134
that I bought this morning.

02:36.202 --> 02:37.469
- No.
- Uh, hold on.

02:37.536 --> 02:39.804
Dotcom is confirming
that he drowned.

02:39.872 --> 02:41.272
Oh.

02:41.323 --> 02:43.174
Why are you putting me in a suit?

02:43.242 --> 02:45.610
I still haven't memorized
my Torah passage.

02:45.678 --> 02:47.979
Oh, you're going to a lunch
for the council on poverty.

02:48.047 --> 02:49.614
And this afternoon,

02:49.682 --> 02:51.616
you're speaking
at the Clinton Foundation.

02:51.684 --> 02:52.967
Speaking?

02:53.052 --> 02:54.669
That doesn't sound like me.
That sounds like work.

02:54.754 --> 02:56.838
Yeah, well, the next level
isn't all fun.

02:56.922 --> 02:58.456
Success is
a double-edged sword.

02:58.524 --> 02:59.924
You're actually respected now.

02:59.992 --> 03:01.526
Like it or not,
people are gonna expect you

03:01.594 --> 03:02.827
to use that power for good.

03:02.895 --> 03:04.329
Come on, sir.
Arms.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.234
There's a line, sir.

03:09.301 --> 03:10.735
I realize you're more important

03:10.803 --> 03:12.303
than everyone else on the flight,

03:12.354 --> 03:14.038
what with those jet sweatpants.

03:14.106 --> 03:15.407
Excuse me, young lady.

03:15.474 --> 03:17.075
Are you old enough
to be traveling alone?

03:17.142 --> 03:19.611
I don't know.
I'm going to visit my nana,

03:19.678 --> 03:20.745
but I'm scared.

03:20.813 --> 03:22.547
Ooh, wait.
That's too young.

03:22.615 --> 03:25.884
Roger that.
Ugh, look at sweatpants guy.

03:25.951 --> 03:27.985
This is a $90 million aircraft,

03:28.037 --> 03:29.838
not a Tallahassee strip club.

03:29.922 --> 03:32.724
Stewart,
21-18 that guy.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.093
Excuse me,
Mr. Sweatpants.

03:35.161 --> 03:37.328
We're gonna need
to check that bag.

03:37.379 --> 03:40.665
And that is sky law.

03:46.405 --> 03:47.939
Hey.

03:48.007 --> 03:50.408
Going to Raleigh
for a business meeting.

03:50.476 --> 03:52.444
I'm a businessman.

03:52.511 --> 03:54.112
I'm not an air marshal.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.080
Good afternoon, folks.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.715
This is Captain Burnett
from the flight deck.

03:57.783 --> 03:59.184
There's some traffic
on the runway.

03:59.251 --> 04:00.585
Should be about a half hour,

04:00.653 --> 04:02.187
then we'll have you on your way.

04:02.254 --> 04:03.755
So sit back, relax,
enjoy your flight.

04:03.823 --> 04:06.391
- Thanks for choosing Air Bike.
- The pilot is my boyfriend.

04:06.459 --> 04:09.260
So if you have any questions
during the flight,

04:09.328 --> 04:11.429
maybe I can...
There's a man on the wing.

04:11.497 --> 04:12.964
Oh.

04:13.032 --> 04:16.434
We haven't taken off yet.
It's just a mechanic.

04:18.637 --> 04:21.639
And this is
the prime minister's suite.

04:21.707 --> 04:23.541
Oh, there it is...

04:23.609 --> 04:25.410
The Metro Toronto
Convention Center,

04:25.478 --> 04:29.881
site of the G-8 summit.

04:29.932 --> 04:31.449
Let's do it on the balcony.

04:31.517 --> 04:33.051
You might have to start
without me.

04:33.118 --> 04:34.319
No problem.

04:34.386 --> 04:35.904
Well, if you need
anything else...

04:35.988 --> 04:37.906
- Ah!
- Oh, God, you're breaking

04:37.990 --> 04:40.058
the extra bone all Canadians
have in their hands.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.727
Oh, Jack!
I think the baby's coming.

04:42.795 --> 04:45.079
What?
You're not due until March.

04:45.164 --> 04:46.948
Why did I buy a beryllium mine

04:47.032 --> 04:48.933
if her birthstone
isn't going to be aquamarine?

04:49.001 --> 04:50.201
We need to get to the airport.

04:50.269 --> 04:52.170
Airport? We need to get you
to a hospital.

04:52.238 --> 04:55.106
No, we can't go to a hospital.
This is Canada!

04:55.174 --> 04:57.625
- If she's born here...
- Good God.

04:57.710 --> 04:58.877
She'll be Canadian.

04:58.944 --> 05:00.545
At the risk
of sounding incredibly rude,

05:00.613 --> 05:02.714
I would beg your pardon
and ask you, in your opinion,

05:02.781 --> 05:04.516
what's so bad
"aboot" being Canadian?

05:04.583 --> 05:06.818
Your milk comes
in bags... Bags.

05:06.886 --> 05:08.686
Your pavilion at Epcot
doesn't have a ride.

05:08.754 --> 05:10.855
And if Canada
is so nice and friendly,

05:10.923 --> 05:11.956
why does most of our meth

05:12.024 --> 05:13.725
come from your Asian drug gangs?

05:13.792 --> 05:15.527
Are we not
even making our own meth?

05:15.594 --> 05:17.562
What is happening
to American manufacturing?

05:17.630 --> 05:20.231
Take our things downstairs
and get us a car to the airport.

05:20.299 --> 05:21.933
Oh, my God.
Jack...

05:21.984 --> 05:24.135
If our child is born here,
she can't be presid...

05:24.203 --> 05:25.537
Don't even say it.

05:25.604 --> 05:29.140
We're having an American,
and she will be president,

05:29.208 --> 05:31.142
no matter how ridiculous
that sentence sounds.

05:31.210 --> 05:33.578
If only we were in Kenya
right now, we'd be fine.

05:35.180 --> 05:36.514
Oh.

05:36.582 --> 05:38.983
If this is helping you, I'm fine.

05:39.051 --> 05:43.521
And in conclusion,
bless you, Tracy Jordan.

05:43.589 --> 05:47.191
Your gripping portrayal
of D'Jeffrey "Lucky" Seeda

05:47.259 --> 05:50.361
in <i>Hard to Watch</i>
<i>has given a voice</i>

05:50.429 --> 05:53.848
to the voiceless...
America's poor.

05:58.671 --> 06:00.538
I'm not scared of you people.

06:00.606 --> 06:02.357
And I don't think those cashews

06:02.441 --> 06:05.209
look like a bowl of baby penises.

06:05.277 --> 06:07.178
Being an egot is fun!

06:07.246 --> 06:09.881
Here's to me
spending the rest of my life

06:09.949 --> 06:11.549
in rooms like this.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.225
Didn't they say
half an hour over an hour ago?

06:21.293 --> 06:22.994
Excuse me.

06:23.062 --> 06:25.330
While we're waiting to take off,
we're going to go ahead

06:25.397 --> 06:26.965
and begin our
in-flight entertainment,

06:27.032 --> 06:28.399
which is the feature film

06:28.467 --> 06:32.203
<i>Legend of the Guardians:</i>
<i>The Owls of Ga'Hoole</i>

06:32.271 --> 06:34.739
and some NBC sitcoms
that didn't make the schedule.

06:37.610 --> 06:40.044
We have to find
the guardians, Eglantine.

06:40.112 --> 06:41.446
Hey.

06:41.513 --> 06:43.314
Hey, Lizzie, you okay?

06:43.382 --> 06:45.483
People are starting to get
a little antsy back there.

06:45.551 --> 06:47.619
Yeah, it's gonna be
about another half hour.

06:47.686 --> 06:49.787
Really? 'Cause I checked
flight tracker on my phone,

06:49.855 --> 06:52.624
and our status is just
an angry, red frowny face.

06:52.691 --> 06:54.258
Okay, you want to know
a little pilot secret,

06:54.326 --> 06:56.327
besides the fact that we get
a discount at Sunglass Hut?

06:56.395 --> 06:58.496
The half-hour thing
is a trick.

06:58.564 --> 07:00.698
It's enough time
so that people know

07:00.766 --> 07:02.634
they're gonna have to wait,
but it doesn't upset them.

07:02.701 --> 07:04.402
So you're just lying?

07:04.470 --> 07:06.638
That's not right.
We're paying customers.

07:06.705 --> 07:08.006
Look, Liz, we have reasons

07:08.073 --> 07:09.607
for doing the things
the way that we do.

07:09.675 --> 07:11.042
When we say, "half an hour"

07:11.110 --> 07:14.045
to control the herds
of walking mozzarella sticks

07:14.113 --> 07:16.047
who think that $300
and a photo I.D.

07:16.115 --> 07:17.815
gives them the right
to fly through the air

07:17.883 --> 07:19.917
like one of
the Guardian Owls of Legend.

07:19.985 --> 07:22.086
God, that's been our
in-flight movie for months.

07:22.154 --> 07:23.554
I just think
it's frustrating for people

07:23.622 --> 07:25.189
to know that
they're being lied to.

07:25.257 --> 07:27.191
Maybe you just want
to fly the plane yourself.

07:27.259 --> 07:28.826
Well, good luck pressing

07:28.894 --> 07:31.029
"take off," then "auto pilot,"
then "land."

07:31.096 --> 07:33.564
Okay, this is obviously
a tense situation for you.

07:33.632 --> 07:35.400
I didn't mean to make it worse.

07:35.467 --> 07:38.703
Just do what you need to do,
and we'll get where we're going.

07:38.771 --> 07:40.438
Uh-huh.
Nags Head.

07:44.476 --> 07:47.311
Oh, no, Soren, it's Metalbeak!

07:47.379 --> 07:48.813
You have to stay awake,
Eglantine,

07:48.881 --> 07:50.882
or the Pure Ones
will moon-blink us.

07:55.821 --> 07:57.555
About half an hour.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.224
Canada...

08:05.482 --> 08:06.648
Every flight is "cancelled."

08:06.649 --> 08:08.534
- No.
- I called the concierge service

08:08.618 --> 08:10.018
with my AMEX invisible card.

08:10.086 --> 08:11.120
There are no rental cars.

08:11.187 --> 08:12.921
The trains and buses
are sold out.

08:12.989 --> 08:15.090
Well, how far is the border?
Maybe we can run.

08:15.158 --> 08:17.426
I don't know. When I asked
the lady at the desk,

08:17.494 --> 08:20.262
- she told me in kilometers.
- Ohh!

08:20.330 --> 08:24.666
Look, Avery, you and I are cut
from the same cloth.

08:24.734 --> 08:26.635
It's one of the reasons
we work so well

08:26.703 --> 08:28.771
and why we're unbeatable
at a three-legged race.

08:28.838 --> 08:30.806
We ruined those kids' field day.

08:30.874 --> 08:33.308
But being similar
has its drawbacks.

08:33.376 --> 08:36.477
- It's a...
- Double-edged sword.

08:36.546 --> 08:41.015
So could our shared patriotism
and refusal to ever give up be,

08:41.083 --> 08:43.684
in this situation, a bad thing?

08:43.753 --> 08:45.988
- What are you saying, Jack?
- Avery...

08:46.055 --> 08:47.823
Maybe it isn't
the end of the world

08:47.891 --> 08:49.124
if our daughter is Canadian.

08:49.192 --> 08:51.426
Alexander Hamilton
was born in the West Indies,

08:51.494 --> 08:53.428
- and he went on to...
- To what, Jack?

08:53.496 --> 08:54.963
Be a mouthpiece for federalism

08:55.031 --> 08:58.333
and then die in a duel
against someone named Aaron?

08:58.401 --> 09:00.202
Is that what you want
our daughter to be...

09:00.270 --> 09:03.305
A big-government duel loser?

09:03.373 --> 09:05.007
No.

09:12.982 --> 09:14.950
Where did all
those babies come from?

09:15.018 --> 09:17.753
Dear God, they've restarted
the failed NBC shows?

09:17.821 --> 09:19.788
Oh, no, please, no!

Please, do something.

09:35.038 --> 09:36.839
You said you knew the captain.

09:36.906 --> 09:38.040
All right.

09:38.107 --> 09:40.042
You know what?
This is wrong.

09:40.109 --> 09:42.377
I can see the terminal
from my window,

09:42.445 --> 09:45.147
where people
are buying new magazines

09:45.215 --> 09:46.982
and crossing their legs

09:47.050 --> 09:49.384
and eating at a chili's express.

09:49.452 --> 09:52.654
We were like them once,
and we can be again.

09:52.722 --> 09:55.190
But we're just airplane folk now.

09:55.258 --> 09:57.893
No.
We still have our dignity.

09:57.961 --> 10:00.162
And maybe we can't go
back to the terminal,

10:00.230 --> 10:01.797
but I know Captain Burnett.

10:01.865 --> 10:03.532
He is a reasonable person.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.669
He compromises readily
on movie choices and...

10:07.737 --> 10:08.871
And sexual positions.

10:08.938 --> 10:10.973
I mean, if we, as a group,

10:11.040 --> 10:14.376
can decide what
reasonable things we want,

10:14.444 --> 10:15.878
I'd be happy to talk to him.

10:15.945 --> 10:17.479
Yeah!

10:17.530 --> 10:19.181
Okay, I can't turn the air on,

10:19.249 --> 10:20.849
because I'd have
to power the engines up.

10:20.917 --> 10:22.117
That wastes fuel.

10:22.185 --> 10:23.652
I'm assuming you don't want
to stop for gas

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
in the middle of the ocean.

10:24.787 --> 10:26.688
Okay, what about the bathrooms?

10:26.756 --> 10:29.708
Stewart did not study dance
at Carnegie Mellon

10:29.792 --> 10:32.060
to become a flight attendant
to clean bathrooms.

10:32.128 --> 10:34.179
Well, at least give us some food.

10:34.264 --> 10:36.298
Negative...
Those potato-chip bags

10:36.366 --> 10:38.300
are designed
to be opened in flight.

10:38.368 --> 10:40.435
You open them at sea level,
somebody could be killed.

10:40.503 --> 10:43.672
And can you tell me when
we might be in the air, captain?

10:43.740 --> 10:46.008
Sure.
In about a half an hour.

10:46.075 --> 10:48.510
Okay, Carol, you
have a decision to make.

10:48.578 --> 10:50.646
Are your passengers just cattle?

10:50.713 --> 10:53.348
Or are some of them...
maybe even just one of them...

10:53.416 --> 10:54.549
someone you care about?

10:54.617 --> 10:56.151
I think you need
to make a decision.

10:56.219 --> 10:57.853
Am I just
another authority figure

10:57.921 --> 10:59.721
that you're taking
one of your stands against,

10:59.789 --> 11:01.323
like that police horse
you yelled at?

11:01.391 --> 11:03.458
If I can't poop in the street,
why should my tax dollars

11:03.526 --> 11:05.494
- pay for someone else to?
- Or am I your boyfriend,

11:05.561 --> 11:07.229
who you're gonna let do his job?

11:07.297 --> 11:09.665
Really?
If this is you doing your job,

11:09.716 --> 11:11.433
you're terrible at it.

11:17.774 --> 11:19.308
Think about what you're doing.

11:19.375 --> 11:22.945
You are making a choice here.
I am not just a passenger.

11:26.950 --> 11:29.885
And the Captain has turned
on the "fasten seat belt" sign.

11:29.953 --> 11:33.722
All passengers, including
any lipless, middle-aged women

11:33.790 --> 11:35.557
in lesbian clown shirts,

11:35.625 --> 11:38.777
should please take
their seat at this time.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:47.103 --> 11:50.071
Uh, Mr. Jordan,
several messages for you.

11:51.374 --> 11:52.874
"Breakfast with Chuck Schumer"?

11:52.942 --> 11:54.977
I don't want to watch
that guy eat.

11:55.044 --> 11:57.412
"5k Homeless Walk"?
That just seems cruel.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.481
"Cornell Commencement Address"?

11:59.549 --> 12:02.017
Sorry, but Tracy Jordan
doesn't do safety schools.

12:02.085 --> 12:04.136
The next level sucks!

12:04.220 --> 12:05.937
Ah, you got to be careful.

12:06.022 --> 12:07.723
You ever hear
of the Peter principle?

12:07.790 --> 12:09.491
- Yes, just now.
- The reason people are unhappy

12:09.559 --> 12:10.926
in their careers
is that they keep

12:10.994 --> 12:12.627
getting promoted until
they're in over their heads.

12:12.695 --> 12:14.146
The Peter principle says

12:14.230 --> 12:16.365
you rise to the level
of your incompetence.

12:16.432 --> 12:18.600
But my incompetence
knows no bounds.

12:18.668 --> 12:19.735
Stay in your comfort zone.

12:19.802 --> 12:21.336
If it was me, I'd just hide out

12:21.404 --> 12:22.771
until people forgot who I was.

12:22.839 --> 12:25.507
But keep in mind, we Hornbergers
are famous cowards.

12:25.575 --> 12:28.677
On D-day, my grandfather
wore a German uniform

12:28.745 --> 12:31.780
under his American one,
just in case.

12:31.831 --> 12:34.182
There's a reason
that men like that

12:34.250 --> 12:35.784
aren't chosen for greatness.

12:35.852 --> 12:36.952
I don't remember saying

12:37.020 --> 12:38.587
you could listen
to that conversation.

12:38.654 --> 12:39.888
But continue.

12:39.955 --> 12:42.424
Imagine if Mr. Hornberger
were in your shoes

12:42.492 --> 12:44.793
and he turned his back
on his community,

12:44.844 --> 12:46.061
on the world.

12:46.129 --> 12:48.063
How would he sleep at night?

12:48.131 --> 12:51.700
How would he look
his children in the eye

12:51.768 --> 12:54.403
or perform
his husband bedroom duties,

12:54.470 --> 12:56.154
for instance
painting the bedroom?

12:56.239 --> 12:58.206
Think about the shame.

12:58.274 --> 13:00.042
He would be run out of town.

13:00.109 --> 13:01.476
Al Sharpton would denounce him

13:01.544 --> 13:03.145
at a press conference
on the street,

13:03.212 --> 13:05.514
because Al Sharpton
doesn't have an office.

13:05.581 --> 13:07.015
Exactly.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.184
I thought going to the next
level would be amazing, Ken,

13:09.252 --> 13:11.653
like guitar-playing
chimpanzee amazing.

13:11.721 --> 13:13.588
God bless and keep him.

13:13.656 --> 13:15.891
But now everybody expects me
to do all of this stuff,

13:15.958 --> 13:19.661
and I don't want to let
anybody down, but I'm scared.

13:23.299 --> 13:25.300
You don't know the meaning
of the word scared.

13:25.368 --> 13:27.135
And I know, because
I've looked it up for you

13:27.203 --> 13:31.206
a dozen times.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.944
- Oh, thank God!
- Hop in!

13:36.011 --> 13:37.579
No, no.
Don't go back there.

13:37.647 --> 13:39.114
- You guys drive.
- What?

13:39.182 --> 13:40.916
You drive while
we hide out in the back...

13:40.983 --> 13:42.417
Hang out in the back.

13:42.485 --> 13:43.919
Everything's normal.

13:43.986 --> 13:45.554
No smoking.

13:45.621 --> 13:47.889
Uh, y-yeah, okay.

13:47.957 --> 13:49.424
Okay.

13:49.492 --> 13:51.243
Thanks, honey.

13:56.099 --> 13:57.966
Great.
I'm Lorne.

13:58.034 --> 14:01.236
If you're a cop,
you have to tell me.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.139
I'm just kidding.
We're all on vacation.

14:08.144 --> 14:10.512
Ah!

14:10.580 --> 14:12.514
Is this a mobile meth lab?

14:12.582 --> 14:13.815
Yes, it is.

14:13.883 --> 14:16.118
- Look, if you want to quit...
- Quit?

14:16.185 --> 14:17.619
I've never quit
anything in my life.

14:17.687 --> 14:20.655
I'm still in Girl Scouts.
I have 9,000 badges.

14:20.723 --> 14:23.492
Hey, I'm still looking for
a golf ball I shanked in 1987.

14:23.559 --> 14:25.260
I am not taking that
penalty stroke.

14:25.328 --> 14:26.862
Good.
We agree.

14:26.929 --> 14:29.131
Now, let's drive
this bomb to Buffalo

14:29.198 --> 14:30.432
and get this
little bitch out of me.

14:46.849 --> 14:48.683
- We've been offered a gate.
- What?

14:48.751 --> 14:49.951
Well, what are
you doing back here?

14:50.019 --> 14:51.319
- Come on, let's go!
- Oh, we'll go.

14:51.387 --> 14:53.588
We'll go back to the terminal
and the lounge

14:53.656 --> 14:55.690
with the reclining chairs
and the turkey wraps.

14:55.758 --> 14:58.593
Turkey wraps.

14:58.661 --> 15:00.795
And we'll forget
any of this ever happened,

15:00.863 --> 15:02.464
like the fact
that you insulted me

15:02.532 --> 15:04.799
in front of my entire crew,
especially Stewart,

15:04.867 --> 15:06.968
who often makes up
hurtful nicknames for me,

15:07.036 --> 15:09.454
- like "Mr. Bumpy Landing."
- Great.

15:09.539 --> 15:11.907
And I'll forget the fact that
you treated us like animals.

15:11.974 --> 15:13.575
Oh, well, I've already forgotten

15:13.643 --> 15:15.210
that you said
I was bad at my job,

15:15.278 --> 15:18.146
when everything <i>TGS</i>
<i>has been so great recently.</i>

15:18.214 --> 15:21.550
Austin Powers on <i>Crossfire...</i>
<i>Timely stuff.</i>

15:21.617 --> 15:23.001
Uh-huh.
And I'm not even gonna ask

15:23.085 --> 15:25.253
what the hell that voice
is that you use on the intercom.

15:25.321 --> 15:28.223
"Uh, folks, half
an hour means forever, uhhhh."

15:29.559 --> 15:31.509
Can I tell you
what I hate about you?

15:31.594 --> 15:34.062
You're so stubborn
when you think you're right,

15:34.130 --> 15:37.232
even when the answer is
on the trivial pursuit card.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.985
The card was wrong.
And you're no better, Carol.

15:40.069 --> 15:42.304
You built that bookshelf
incorrectly!

15:42.371 --> 15:44.372
I did not!
I wanted the books to slide off.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.358
Okay, listen, Liz...

15:46.442 --> 15:47.842
We will get through this

15:47.910 --> 15:51.346
if, for once,
you can just let it go.

15:51.414 --> 15:53.315
I will take us back to the gate

15:53.382 --> 15:57.118
when you stand up in front
of my crew and my passengers

15:57.186 --> 15:58.553
and admit that you were wrong.

15:58.621 --> 16:00.188
- What?
- Admit that I,

16:00.256 --> 16:02.857
as captain of this vessel,
was in the right.

16:02.925 --> 16:04.559
You were wrong to question me,

16:04.627 --> 16:05.961
and I was correct in my treatment

16:06.012 --> 16:07.696
of you and your fellow animals.

16:07.763 --> 16:09.931
I'd rather die on this plane.

16:09.999 --> 16:12.000
That can be arranged.

16:21.306 --> 16:23.312
Um, you saw the back of the winny.

16:23.432 --> 16:25.142
You know we picked you up
to get past border control.

16:25.143 --> 16:26.344
So what are you guys carrying?

16:26.411 --> 16:28.212
- I'm sorry?
- In her fake stomach......

16:28.280 --> 16:30.147
You smuggling
unpasteurized cheese,

16:30.215 --> 16:31.515
prescription drugs,

16:31.583 --> 16:33.584
maple syrup from the sacred tree
of souls in Winnipeg?

16:33.652 --> 16:35.786
No.
She's pregnant.

16:35.854 --> 16:37.888
What? Those contractions
she's been having are real?

16:37.940 --> 16:39.423
Because they sound
very sitcom-y.

16:39.491 --> 16:43.027
Ughhh, zoinks!

16:43.095 --> 16:44.829
What is taking so long?

16:44.896 --> 16:46.631
You guys should be in a hospital,

16:46.698 --> 16:48.666
not driving to Buffalo
in a snowstorm.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.268
Thank you for your input, Lorne,

16:50.335 --> 16:52.870
but Avery and I want our
daughter to be born in America,

16:52.938 --> 16:54.672
so she can one day become
president

16:54.740 --> 16:57.508
and declare war on Germany,
like back when we were awesome.

16:57.576 --> 16:59.310
You know, you remind me
of my parents.

16:59.378 --> 17:00.845
I find that very hard to believe.

17:00.912 --> 17:02.513
They were both really intense.

17:02.581 --> 17:04.848
They wanted me to grow up
to be prime minister,

17:04.915 --> 17:07.151
so as a kid,
I had to win the spelling bee.

17:07.219 --> 17:08.386
They made me memorize

17:08.453 --> 17:10.688
all 700 words
in the Canadian dictionary.

17:10.756 --> 17:12.223
And then I had
to go to Law School.

17:12.290 --> 17:14.492
- You went to Law School?
- For one day.

17:14.559 --> 17:16.861
I was just so tightly wound
that I got kicked out

17:16.928 --> 17:18.229
for karate chopping my roommate.

17:18.297 --> 17:20.897
I know.
I'm a stereotype...

17:20.965 --> 17:22.900
All guys from Quebec
are good at karate.

17:22.968 --> 17:25.002
God.

17:25.069 --> 17:26.436
Oh, my God, where are my manners?

17:26.505 --> 17:28.372
Do you want to try meth?

17:28.440 --> 17:30.007
- What are you doing?
- I'm quitting.

17:30.075 --> 17:32.209
I'm calling 911
and getting an ambulance

17:32.277 --> 17:33.744
to take us
to the nearest hospital.

17:33.812 --> 17:35.579
Actually, you dial 272 here.

17:35.647 --> 17:37.081
I will not do that.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.035
Kenworth, I was thinking
about what you said,

17:41.119 --> 17:42.253
and you're right.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.155
I'm Oscar-winner Tracy Jordan.

17:44.222 --> 17:45.656
And as scary as it is,

17:45.724 --> 17:47.658
I have a responsibility
to fix the world,

17:47.726 --> 17:49.660
starting
with the worst place ever.

17:49.728 --> 17:50.928
Ikea on a Saturday?

17:50.996 --> 17:53.064
Africa.
I leave today.

17:53.131 --> 17:55.032
Good-bye.

17:56.335 --> 17:58.669
Begin moving my things
into his dressing room.

18:02.341 --> 18:03.774
Well, folks,
from the flight deck,

18:03.842 --> 18:05.409
it looks like it's gonna be
about another half hour,

18:05.477 --> 18:08.029
and then we'll be on our way.
Uhhhhhh...

18:08.113 --> 18:09.747
I have an announcement.

18:09.815 --> 18:11.515
Our pilot has gone insane.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.284
No, don't listen
to her. Don't...

18:13.352 --> 18:15.386
Having seen <i>Crimson Tide</i>
<i>on Showtime last weekend,</i>

18:15.454 --> 18:17.188
I believe the only course
of action available to us

18:17.255 --> 18:18.322
is passenger mutiny.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.423
I am Denzel.

18:19.491 --> 18:21.125
I am invoking sky law.

18:21.193 --> 18:23.461
You are now silenced,
shrieking harpy.

18:23.528 --> 18:24.995
Stop speaking.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.881
We could've gone back to
a gate, and he wouldn't take us!

18:26.965 --> 18:28.899
Do not blame me.

18:28.967 --> 18:32.203
I wouldn't take us, because she
wouldn't admit to being wrong

18:32.270 --> 18:33.904
for challenging my authority.

18:33.972 --> 18:35.973
Why not?
What's wrong with you?

18:36.041 --> 18:37.475
I am right, and he knows it.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.009
He could've given us food...

18:39.061 --> 18:41.011
Maybe this is one
of those times when both of you

18:41.079 --> 18:42.813
just say, on the count
of three, "I was wrong."

18:42.881 --> 18:44.432
One, two, three.
Never!

18:44.516 --> 18:47.251
How are you two dating?
You're too similar!

18:49.654 --> 18:50.821
Where are you going?

18:50.889 --> 18:52.123
I am pulling
the emergency exit slide,

18:52.190 --> 18:54.091
and we are all getting off
of this plane!

18:54.159 --> 18:55.593
I'll be a folk hero,

18:55.660 --> 18:57.294
like that guy
everybody hates now.

18:57.362 --> 18:59.997
Don't you even think about it!
That is a federal offense!

19:00.065 --> 19:01.265
Just try to stop me.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.100
Oh, you be careful
what you wish for.

19:05.370 --> 19:06.971
I will waste you!

19:07.038 --> 19:10.741
You'll have to go through
this old bastard first!

19:20.585 --> 19:22.353
Soren, Eglantine,

19:22.421 --> 19:24.789
your journey is at an end.

19:24.856 --> 19:26.757
Sorry.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.728
I hope we can still be friends.

19:36.935 --> 19:39.603
- Hello?
- Lemon, we had the baby.

19:39.671 --> 19:41.672
- We? We?
- Shh, you need your rest.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.041
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

19:44.109 --> 19:45.843
Wait.
Aren't you in Canada?

19:45.911 --> 19:47.878
Yes, my daughter
is Canadian-American,

19:47.946 --> 19:50.714
but I'm going to treat her
just like a human baby.

19:50.782 --> 19:53.050
We tried to get back home,
Lemon, in a meth lab.

19:53.118 --> 19:54.885
Avery and I fed
each other's craziness,

19:54.953 --> 19:56.720
but one of us was brave enough
to step back and...

19:56.788 --> 19:59.123
- Just quit. He quit.
- Didn't they give you Percocet?

19:59.191 --> 20:01.358
That's what it takes.

20:01.426 --> 20:04.195
Somebody needs
to be willing to quit.

20:04.262 --> 20:06.430
I hope you and Avery can make it,

20:06.498 --> 20:08.649
because you have
a whole lifetime ahead of you

20:08.733 --> 20:11.469
of that double-edged sword
just swinging around

20:11.536 --> 20:13.204
trying to cut your faces off.

20:13.271 --> 20:14.371
Thank you, Lemon.

20:14.439 --> 20:16.207
This was supposed to be
a joyous occasion.

20:16.274 --> 20:17.575
I'm glad I called.

20:17.642 --> 20:20.377
I'm sorry. Your daughter
is a very lucky girl.

20:21.546 --> 20:23.314
- Carol and I have...
- Jack.

20:23.381 --> 20:24.849
- What?
- This woman's trying to tell me

20:24.916 --> 20:26.667
that we don't have to pay
for any of this.

20:26.751 --> 20:28.319
Right. The Canadian
health-care system...

20:28.386 --> 20:29.687
Oh, no, you don't.

20:29.754 --> 20:32.423
We will not be party
to this socialist perversion.

20:32.491 --> 20:33.858
You will take our money.

20:33.925 --> 20:35.826
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't do that.

20:35.894 --> 20:37.294
Oh, this is gonna be good.

20:37.362 --> 20:40.214
- Avery, can you walk yet?
- I am right behind you, Jack.

20:40.298 --> 20:43.200
Let's go find a Canadian
who will take our money.

20:44.980 --> 20:47.214
- How's Africa, sir?
- It's amazing.

20:47.215 --> 20:49.032
This morning I taught
the local schoolchildren

20:49.100 --> 20:50.600
all the words to <i>Monster Mash.</i>

20:50.668 --> 20:53.236
So when do you
think you'll be coming back?

20:53.547 --> 20:55.695
<i>TGS</i> has a show in a couple weeks.

20:55.733 --> 20:57.878
Don't you get it?
This is bigger than all that.

20:57.998 --> 21:00.602
Like how an egg is much bigger
than a smaller bug.

21:00.722 --> 21:02.680
Well, that's another way to say that sir...

21:02.800 --> 21:03.687
I have to go.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.656
This was a really good decision.

21:05.949 --> 21:06.925
Good bye, Kenneth.

21:07.722 --> 21:15.967

Yeah, really good decision.
