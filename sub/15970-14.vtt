00:01.920 --> 00:03.360
<i>Go now, go!</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:10.040
(theme music playing)

01:09.520 --> 01:12.640
So, Rayanne, you got 33 days.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.880
33 days to do what?

01:16.640 --> 01:18.040
No, it's an expression.

01:18.120 --> 01:21.960
In AA, it means you've been clean
and sober for over a month.

01:22.560 --> 01:27.320
-Oh, yeah. I feel, like, really good.
-I know you do.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.800
This is kind of a dangerous time.

01:34.160 --> 01:35.920
-Oh!
-(bell rings)

01:36.000 --> 01:38.880
(Angela)<i> So Jordan Catalano and I</i>
<i>had pretty much broken up.</i>

01:39.480 --> 01:42.040
<i>But he still knew</i>
<i>the combination to my locker.</i>

01:48.560 --> 01:50.760
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.760
Just...

01:53.560 --> 01:57.760
(Angela) <i>You need me.</i>
<i>You must have me as your own.</i>

01:57.840 --> 02:01.360
<i>You can't live another second</i>
<i>knowing others could possess me.</i>

02:02.000 --> 02:03.360
I could kill Tino.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.880
What'd you call that?
That word you said last week.

02:07.960 --> 02:11.560
You know, when you feel
the need to, like, eat?

02:13.120 --> 02:15.760
-Hunger?
-No, that thing you said I was.

02:16.360 --> 02:20.120
Oh, I wasn't actually saying
that you're, um, orally fixated...

02:20.200 --> 02:22.040
Orally fixated.
That's such a cool word.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.200
You know, I was saying that
you have certain...

02:24.280 --> 02:27.840
Because I have this, like, theory
of how that probably happened to me.

02:27.920 --> 02:31.160
You see, my mother,
she, like, claims that she breast-fed me,

02:31.240 --> 02:33.360
but I just have serious doubts.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.080
I mean, you should see her boobs.
They are so firm.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.400
(telephone rings indistinctly)

02:38.040 --> 02:39.080
Lolly?

02:39.640 --> 02:42.360
Sure. Um, look, Rayanne,

02:42.440 --> 02:45.680
I know you've chosen not to continue
these sessions with me...

02:45.760 --> 02:47.840
-...right now. Thanks.
-I have to do this therapy for a month

02:47.920 --> 02:49.560
and then it's optional, right?

02:49.640 --> 02:50.960
No. I know that. I realize that.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.760
I just need to know
that you have a support system in place.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.920
I don't need a support system.
I got friends.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.560
That's exactly why I'm raising this.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.960
I mean, didn't you mention to me

02:59.040 --> 03:01.480
that you've had some feelings of distance
from your friends

03:01.560 --> 03:04.600
since, you know, the incident?

03:05.800 --> 03:06.720
What incident?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.560
I'm talking about the night
you nearly died,

03:09.640 --> 03:11.880
the night that Angela's mother
rushed you to the hospital.

03:11.960 --> 03:14.200
Now, didn't you tell me
that since that night,

03:14.280 --> 03:18.040
you've felt some distance between yourself
and your friend Angela?

03:18.120 --> 03:20.920
I never said distance.
I just don't see her that much.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.440
It's not 'cause of some incident.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.240
It's 'cause she's got this guy
that she's, like, involved with,

03:26.760 --> 03:28.720
which she wouldn't even have
if it wasn't for me.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.160
And you don't feel
any awkwardness around Angela?

03:32.240 --> 03:35.840
(laughs) No. The thing with Angela is,

03:35.920 --> 03:39.120
even with this stupid obsession
with this guy,

03:39.200 --> 03:41.360
she's, like, totally there for me.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.160
So, where's Angela?

03:43.240 --> 03:45.480
"Whatever you do,
don't take the first drink."

03:45.560 --> 03:48.880
AA propaganda from Miss Crazy-nowski.
What a wimpette.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.400
Thought you said you liked her,
that she's sensitive.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.240
Sensitive wears thin.
Go ahead, keep it. I don't need it.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.160
So, she's with Catalano again, huh?

03:57.240 --> 03:59.720
Well, it's the weirdest breakup
in history.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.000
-She's the one that needs the shrink.
-Hmm.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.320
So he just said
this isn't working for me...

04:07.200 --> 04:09.720
then he threw his mike
right into Joey's base drum...

04:10.760 --> 04:13.400
and then he... left.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.640
So he quit?
Tino quit Frozen Embryos?

04:16.720 --> 04:19.920
Yeah. We're not even allowed
to call ourselves Frozen Embryos anymore,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.680
'cause it was Tino's name.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.920
So now it's, like...

04:24.880 --> 04:26.360
off limits or something.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.560
I'm really sorry.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.360
(Angela)
<i>I'm just really, like, low.</i>

04:32.440 --> 04:35.000
<i>I'll just find any excuse to touch him.</i>

04:36.600 --> 04:37.720
(Rayanne) Hey.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.520
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

04:41.640 --> 04:43.200
No. Hi.

04:43.880 --> 04:47.280
-Oh! No, you don't have to...
-Whatever. Later.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.400
(Rayanne chuckles)

04:48.480 --> 04:51.400
(indistinct chatter)

04:51.480 --> 04:55.480
He's just a bit upset
about this thing with Tino.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.200
Why am I telling you?
You must have heard, right?

04:58.280 --> 04:59.680
Oh, yeah.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.560
So what happened?

05:02.640 --> 05:05.560
Oh, about Tino quitting Frozen Embryos.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.280
I mean, I only know because he told me.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.800
Why? You think that bothers me
that you know?

05:12.400 --> 05:14.840
Tino would be telling me right now
if he was, like, in school.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.480
Right, I know.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.400
(whistle blows)

05:21.520 --> 05:24.280
So, Angeleeka, what's the deal?
Do I ever get to see you again?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.800
-Oh, I know, I just...
-(chuckles) I'm just kidding.

05:27.880 --> 05:30.280
Yeah. I see you too much.
Don't flatter yourself.

05:32.280 --> 05:35.080
No, really. You should really come over,
like, after school.

05:35.440 --> 05:39.240
-Is that cool with Patty-cake?
-Yeah, of course it is. Don't be crazy.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.760
She never comes home before 6 anyway.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.720
Well, you know, maybe I will.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.800
Mm-hmm.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.720
Careful. Don't break the egg yolk.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.200
So you actually, like,
teach people how to cook?

05:56.880 --> 05:58.920
-Yeah, I actually, like, do.
-(Rayanne chuckles)

05:59.520 --> 06:01.920
Listen, I'm sorry
that Angela's not home yet.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.400
-Do you guys have definite plans?
-Like this?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.840
That's perfect. You're a natural.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.240
(knock on door)

06:09.320 --> 06:11.240
Ah! This must be her.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.400
Ah! My God.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.880
-(Graham) Oh, you're back.
-(Patty) I'm back.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.680
Hi.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.320
(chuckles) Hey.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.960
Hey! Watch that chocolate sauce.
I'll get the rest of the groceries.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.040
Can I get you something to drink,
like a soda?

06:32.120 --> 06:34.840
Yeah. Thanks.
Anything with sugar and caffeine.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.360
(laughs)

06:37.360 --> 06:38.640
So where's Angela?

06:39.720 --> 06:43.960
Well, she's got better things
to do or what have you.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.960
Well, it's great to see you.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.520
So, uh, you mean, she's with, um...

06:52.520 --> 06:55.000
Uh, I mean, I thought they weren't...

06:55.080 --> 06:57.120
Exactly. You figure it out.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.680
It's like watching a roller coaster.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.440
Actually,
I think they're in the ticket line,

07:01.520 --> 07:05.880
-like, really close to the roller coaster.
-I see.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.360
So, did Angela tell you? I got 33 days.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.000
I'm squeaky clean like a rubber ducky.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.720
No, Angela didn't tell me.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.840
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.240
-Hi, honey.
-(Danielle) Hello.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.200
(burps)

07:25.000 --> 07:26.440
You're supposed to say "Excuse me."

07:27.080 --> 07:28.880
Oh, right. Sorry. Excuse me.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.480
Oh, my God. The chocolate sauce.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.440
Oh! It's okay. It's not bubbling.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.400
Oh, chocolate sauce. Can I try it?

07:35.480 --> 07:37.240
(Graham) Be careful. It's very, very hot.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.680
(Patty) Just a taste. We're about to eat.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.280
-(Danielle) Mmm!
-(Patty) Oh, Danielle.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.440
Come here. Let me fix it.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.320
-No...
-Hey!

07:47.320 --> 07:49.960
-I have to wash my whole face now.
-Good.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.920
Rayanne, why don't you stay for dinner?

07:54.280 --> 07:57.840
-Angela will be back any minute.
-No, no. I got to go.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.200
You know, my mom's making dinner. Later.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.640
You know, that girl never said thank you.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.640
-For the soda?
-For saving her life.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.960
<i>Well, I can't sleep, Bert.</i>
<i>I can't fall asleep.</i>

08:15.040 --> 08:17.000
<i>Well, count sheep, then, Ernie.</i>

08:17.680 --> 08:19.680
<i>Count sheep?</i>
<i>What do you mean count sheep?</i>

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
<i>I mean, just lie there and count sheep.</i>

08:21.840 --> 08:23.200
<i>Imagine them one at a time,</i>

08:23.280 --> 08:26.480
<i>until you get so sleepy,</i>
<i>you just fall asleep. Okay?</i>

08:27.680 --> 08:28.840
<i>-I'll try it, Bert.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

08:28.920 --> 08:31.400
<i>All right, let's see, counting sheep.</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:36.440
<i>Baa.</i>

08:37.320 --> 08:38.760
So, when's dinner?

08:40.440 --> 08:43.000
Oh... You're hungry?

08:43.480 --> 08:45.560
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.680
-You didn't eat lunch?
-It's Tuesday. I saw my counselor today.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.480
-What counselor?
-My drug counselor... Miss Krzyzanowski.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.600
-Remember? I told you.
-Okay! Let's see what we got here.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.720
Egg rolls, mini quiche, and...
Oh! Pirogis!

09:01.800 --> 09:04.000
I'm sick of appetizers.

09:04.560 --> 09:08.720
I want a real meal,
with all four basic food groups.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.160
For once, can it not be
such an amazing surprise

09:12.240 --> 09:15.600
that I want to eat dinner
like every other American on the planet?

09:16.360 --> 09:18.440
-Okay, what's up?
-Nothing.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.320
Angela invites me over today,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.960
and... and when I get there,
she's nowhere to be found.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.920
What? Did you two have a fight
or something?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.920
-No.
-Okay.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.600
-What'd you do?
-What'd I do?

09:32.600 --> 09:34.280
Yeah, to make Angela mad at you.

09:34.680 --> 09:35.920
I didn't do anything.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.320
She's just with Jordan Catalano
all the time.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.400
Well, then, you be with him, too.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.480
You hang out with her
while she's with Jordan.

09:44.160 --> 09:45.400
You know Jordan's friends.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
I mean, become part of it, Raynnie.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.160
That's not hard. Everyone loves you.

09:51.920 --> 09:54.640
Ah! Look what we forgot we had.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.240
Leftover Chinese.

09:59.560 --> 10:00.560
Raynnie...

10:04.160 --> 10:05.920
Butterfly shrimp.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.600
Now, I've seen a lot of your friends
come and go,

10:16.680 --> 10:19.280
and most of them,
I could've cared less about.

10:19.920 --> 10:23.240
But Angela... she's special.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.960
What I still can't figure out...

10:27.320 --> 10:28.720
is why Tino even quit.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.040
That's what's so... frustrating.

10:34.480 --> 10:35.920
Can you imagine what that's like?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.680
To have to, like, sit around,

10:39.200 --> 10:42.280
trying to figure out what someone else
is, like, thinking?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.440
-Hey, what's up?
-Oh.

10:53.240 --> 10:54.400
Oh, Rayanne, hi.

10:56.760 --> 10:58.400
So my parents said
you stopped by yesterday.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.520
But I thought you said
you weren't going to, so...

11:00.600 --> 11:02.920
No problem.
Guzzled a six-pack, two hits "x,"

11:03.000 --> 11:06.520
I was back to new.
So Catalano, how's it going?

11:07.520 --> 11:10.520
Um... I was just saying
how Frozen Embryos

11:10.600 --> 11:13.920
finally got a spot at this Open Mic Night
at Vertigo, that coffee house.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.960
I, like, know what vertigo is.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.160
Right. Well, um...

11:18.240 --> 11:20.720
They still don't have a lead singer.
So it's, like...

11:20.800 --> 11:22.320
Um, you know, should they blow it off,

11:22.400 --> 11:25.160
or find somebody new
by next Thursday or...

11:25.240 --> 11:27.120
So Tino's still being a low-life, huh?

11:28.160 --> 11:30.600
Could you two, like... leave?

11:32.440 --> 11:35.920
(upbeat music playing)

11:38.600 --> 11:39.600
Oh, my God!

11:39.680 --> 11:42.800
Angela, I just had the most
unbelievable idea.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.560
I'm, like, so brilliant,
I, like, amaze myself.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.280
Me.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.240
What about you?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.600
I should be the new lead singer
for Frozen Embryos.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.640
Well, come on, I'm serious.
Talk to Jordan.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.240
I don't know if it sounds very realistic.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.280
Oh, what sounds realistic?

12:00.360 --> 12:02.680
I spent a month stone cold sober.
That doesn't sound realistic.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.560
I can't just tell Jordan Catalano
something like that.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.920
Angela, think of it.
We'd have such a time.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.480
You hanging out with the band,
me being the band.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.400
Come on, he'll do it if you ask him.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.600
No, he won't. He's Jordan Catalano.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.600
Just promise you'll ask him
for me, okay?

12:21.760 --> 12:23.520
Angeleeka, please?

12:25.240 --> 12:26.480
Sure, I promise.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.320
Whoo! Whoo!

12:31.280 --> 12:35.040
(mellow music playing)

12:41.480 --> 12:43.960
(telephone ringing)

12:45.240 --> 12:47.680
(Danielle)
I'll get it! I'll get it! It's mine!

12:47.760 --> 12:49.080
Ah... Hello?

12:50.240 --> 12:53.200
Yeah. It's your boyfriend Ryan.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.480
He's not my boyfriend.
He was, but we're keeping it loose.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.400
I'll take it in the other room.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.720
Are either of them married yet?
I mean, how much have I missed?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.240
I hope you can join us for dinner tonight.

13:07.840 --> 13:11.200
-We never see you anymore.
-(Danielle) Somebody hang up!

13:12.520 --> 13:15.480
That's what everybody tells me.
Rayanne says that, you say that.

13:15.560 --> 13:18.400
Rayanne isn't seeing you,
and we're not seeing you.

13:18.480 --> 13:19.440
Who is seeing you?

13:19.520 --> 13:21.520
-And how much of you?
-Dad.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
I asked a question about your life,
didn't I?

13:25.080 --> 13:26.640
Whoa! What came over me?

13:27.560 --> 13:33.120
-So... Rayanne seems to be doing okay.
-Oh, she is. Of course, she is.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.840
She was actually seeing a counselor
for a little while.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.000
She was seeing her?

13:37.080 --> 13:39.320
I thought she told me
she was still seeing her.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.120
-(car honks)
-Got to go.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.440
Jordan's giving me a ride to school.
Is that what you want to hear?

13:44.520 --> 13:49.640
Yes. And am I ever going to get a chance
to meet him?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.400
-Dad met him.
-I met him.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.640
-Wait a second. Are we the same person?
-Almost, but...

13:54.720 --> 13:58.080
Mom, I'm going to be late for school.
There are state laws.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.720
Anyway, it's completely over
between me and Jordan Catalano.

14:05.800 --> 14:10.760
Well, it finally happened.
I've completely lost touch with her.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.480
(door closes)

14:14.000 --> 14:15.880
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.520
Who is this Ryan?

14:19.120 --> 14:20.720
Mom, I have to go to school.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.120
(birds chirping)

14:28.520 --> 14:29.840
(door closes)

14:30.600 --> 14:32.880
I can't even face rehearsal tonight.

14:32.960 --> 14:35.760
There's gonna be, like,
this big empty hole where Tino used to be.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.680
I'm really sorry.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.920
I mean,
I'm sure it's going to all work out.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.600
-I mean... you'll find someone, somehow.
-Yeah, right.

14:48.360 --> 14:50.280
So listen, this is probably
a really stupid idea,

14:50.360 --> 14:53.080
but would Frozen Embryos
ever want, like, a girl,

14:53.160 --> 14:54.520
I mean, to sing?

14:55.520 --> 14:58.400
Like, I don't know,
Rayanne Graff or something?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.200
Rayanne... Graff?

15:06.360 --> 15:09.080
Right, yeah. No, uh... I mean...

15:09.960 --> 15:12.600
Forget it. I'll see you.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.440
So did she talk to him?

15:17.520 --> 15:20.440
'Cause I hear they rehearse tonight,
so I should be there, right?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.920
Rayanne, I don't think they...
You know...

15:23.000 --> 15:25.200
I hear they're not even
Frozen Embryos anymore.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.640
They don't even, like, have a name.

15:27.720 --> 15:29.720
Well, that's perfect.
Then I'll give them a name.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.760
It'll be a totally new era, an era of me.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.480
Rayanne, if they don't want you...

15:35.560 --> 15:38.160
Well, why would they
possibly not want me?

15:39.280 --> 15:42.040
I mean, I'm cute,
I'm a total exhibitionist,

15:42.120 --> 15:45.320
and I can certainly sing
just as loud and obnoxious as Tino.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.240
I just wanna make sure you don't make this
into a bigger deal than it is.

15:49.320 --> 15:53.240
What? You think I'll drink myself
into some stupor over some stupid band?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.840
No, of course not. I mean...

15:55.920 --> 15:58.800
It's just that I actually spoke to Angela,
you know, and...

15:59.360 --> 16:02.240
I just don't think
they're looking for a girl singer.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.000
So did she... so did she explain
how good I am?

16:06.600 --> 16:09.240
Look, I... I wasn't there.
I'm just telling you what she said.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.560
You know, maybe you should
just go talk to her yourself.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.600
Well, maybe I will.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.240
(indistinct chatter)

16:24.080 --> 16:26.960
-What is it? What did she do?
-Nothing... yet.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.720
I mean, I've seen her like this, you know,
excited about something.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.480
When she's excited like this...

16:34.120 --> 16:36.040
it's kind of dangerous.

16:36.120 --> 16:40.520
<i>♪ Out to get to Sesame Street ♪</i>

16:40.600 --> 16:42.480
<i>♪ Out to get to Sesame Street ♪</i>

16:42.560 --> 16:44.760
(toilet flushes)

16:45.960 --> 16:46.960
What?

16:47.560 --> 16:49.240
-That was you?
-So?

16:50.120 --> 16:53.720
Nothing. Nothing. You just...
you just have a decent voice.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.000
I'm sorry. Did I say you could listen?

16:57.080 --> 16:59.800
I'm sorry. I didn't know
this was your private recording studio.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.720
I'm sorry. It is.

17:05.320 --> 17:08.000
Look, so, like, in your opinion,
I can sing halfway decent?

17:08.080 --> 17:09.800
Like, say, I could sing
in front of people?

17:10.520 --> 17:12.440
Maybe if you dressed a little more normal.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.920
(door opens)

17:18.520 --> 17:19.880
Let me ask you about something.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.720
Say, one person finds out

17:22.800 --> 17:25.680
there's a way she can get into a band
that needs a lead singer,

17:25.760 --> 17:27.240
and say this person can sing...

17:27.320 --> 17:29.240
-This is you, right?
-Just listen.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.720
So she asks this other person
to put in a good word for,

17:32.800 --> 17:35.120
because this other person
hangs out with someone in the band...

17:35.200 --> 17:37.400
-Whoa! Wait! What band?
-Shut up!

17:37.480 --> 17:42.560
So... this other person
is acting all put out about this,

17:42.640 --> 17:44.920
like it's some big chore or something.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.120
Why, because she wants to sing
in the band herself?

17:48.480 --> 17:51.760
No, that would be totally impossible.
She totally could not attempt that.

17:51.840 --> 17:54.440
The point is,
wouldn't she want to do this,

17:54.520 --> 17:56.200
I mean, if she was a real friend,

17:56.280 --> 17:59.600
I mean, if she really believed in me...
I mean, her?

18:02.720 --> 18:06.120
Unless, I guess, she thought this person
would make a complete fool of herself.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.720
So, this is Angela, right?

18:12.800 --> 18:16.760
(rock music playing)

18:17.880 --> 18:19.040
I'm just saying lower it.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.240
Lower it? What are you saying?
You think my bass is too loud?

18:21.320 --> 18:23.960
-Yeah, and out of tune.
-I'm not out of tune, man.

18:24.040 --> 18:25.040
What's this? Tino's gone,

18:25.120 --> 18:26.760
now you're gonna start telling
who's out of tune?

18:26.840 --> 18:29.240
You're a drummer. You don't know anything
about who's out of tune!

18:29.320 --> 18:31.080
Yeah! I know when something
sounds like crap!

18:31.160 --> 18:32.400
All right!

18:32.480 --> 18:35.280
Can we just get through this one song?

18:35.880 --> 18:38.760
-I'm out of here. I got get some pizza.
-Now you're going to eat?

18:38.840 --> 18:40.800
That's all you ever do is eat, man!

18:40.880 --> 18:42.320
Hey, what are you? The new Tino?

18:42.400 --> 18:43.960
Throw that bass near my drums,
I'll kill you.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.120
All right!

18:45.200 --> 18:47.040
Look at us! We're ridiculous!

18:47.880 --> 18:49.480
We're not a band anymore.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.200
-We don't even have a name.
-(guitar buzzes)

18:57.120 --> 18:59.960
(man on TV)<i> Time's running out.</i>
<i>There's only one more week.</i>

19:00.040 --> 19:03.440
Hello? Angela, telephone!

19:06.280 --> 19:07.480
-Hello?
-Hey.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.920
Oh, hi.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.200
Danielle, hang up!

19:12.280 --> 19:14.760
Danielle, I know you're listening.
I can hear the TV.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.160
Danielle, come on.
Let's respect Angela's privacy.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.680
So Rayanne Graff is here.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.600
(Angela) <i>Rayanne is there?</i>

19:22.680 --> 19:24.640
Oh. What's she doing there?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.840
I don't know. I was going to ask you.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.040
I mean, no one even invited her.

19:30.120 --> 19:33.320
Now, she's, like, coming onto my drummer,
acting like she's high.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.600
What does she want?

19:34.680 --> 19:37.400
I don't know.
I have nothing to do with it.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.360
(Angela)<i> So, how's the rehearsal going?</i>

19:39.440 --> 19:43.240
It sucks. Right now, everyone's basically
just sitting around the loft...

19:43.320 --> 19:44.880
<i>...drinking beers.</i>

19:45.760 --> 19:47.160
Danielle, hang up!

19:51.200 --> 19:53.160
-Um...
-Patty!

19:55.320 --> 19:57.680
So I'm really sorry,
I mean, about Rayanne.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.880
(Angela) <i>I'm glad you called though.</i>

19:59.960 --> 20:04.160
<i>I mean, this is the first time</i>
<i>you've ever called me on the phone.</i>

20:05.320 --> 20:07.320
I got to go.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.160
You were listening in
on her phone conversation.

20:11.880 --> 20:15.720
-Patricia, you disappoint me.
-Oh, shut up.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.600
It's the only way
I could get any information.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.800
And by the way, that was your close,
personal friend Jordan Catalano.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.920
Seems that Rayanne
is in a loft drinking beer.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.280
So much for her great sobriety.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.280
How is Jordan? He send his regards?

20:30.360 --> 20:35.760
All right. You met him for one minute.
Stop lording it over me.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.640
You know, I... I have to say...

20:40.640 --> 20:42.720
I'm... I'm worried about Rayanne.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.320
Well, Angela seems to think
she's doing okay.

20:44.400 --> 20:48.080
Yeah, but... would Angela even tell us
if she was worried about her?

20:48.160 --> 20:50.560
I mean, she barely speaks to us.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.880
I have this feeling like...
like she's in trouble.

20:53.960 --> 20:57.160
And what do I do?
I mean, do I talk to her mom?

20:57.240 --> 20:58.960
-Can you do that with people? No.
-Patty.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.920
I know, I can't. It's...
crossing the line.

21:05.520 --> 21:10.160
(TV playing indistinctly)

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
(Patty) You're right.

21:15.080 --> 21:18.280
No, I'm not right.
You have to be awake to be right.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.640
-Sorry.
-Mmm.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.880
Why is that, though, do you suppose?

21:25.960 --> 21:29.320
-I mean... Why is it so taboo?
-(Graham sighs)

21:29.400 --> 21:35.000
Why... Why is it that you can't speak
to people honestly about their children?

21:37.160 --> 21:39.520
Because... I'm going to kill you.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.920
-Patty, it's, like, 12:15.
-I know, I know. I know.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.800
Okay, I'm gonna stop obsessing about this.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.880
Starting now. (sighs)

21:52.080 --> 21:53.520
-Good night.
-Good night.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.040
Because...

22:01.160 --> 22:03.160
'cause nobody wants to hear
something like that.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.440
Nobody want to hear that they may have
made a mistake with their kids.

22:06.520 --> 22:10.200
Nobody wants to be accused
of not being a decent parent.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.080
No, it is. It is an unwritten law.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.600
Whatever goes on in your family
is your business.

22:15.680 --> 22:18.040
Period. Nobody else's.

22:18.800 --> 22:21.360
Do you mind? I'm trying to sleep here.

22:23.960 --> 22:24.960
(sighs)

22:25.040 --> 22:26.520
Do you really believe that?

22:26.600 --> 22:29.680
I mean, you really believe
that it would be that much

22:29.760 --> 22:31.320
of an intrusion to casually

22:31.400 --> 22:34.800
and non-confrontationally mention
to someone

22:34.880 --> 22:37.760
that you happen to be
a little concerned about their child?

22:37.840 --> 22:40.080
All right. Okay. How would you respond
to something like that,

22:40.160 --> 22:43.480
you know, as some friendly,
well-meaning comment like that?

22:43.560 --> 22:45.040
Poison dart.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.480
Good night, Gracie. (clears throat)

22:49.560 --> 22:50.840
(Patty sighs)

22:55.720 --> 22:57.680
You know, you're absolutely right.

22:57.760 --> 23:01.160
It would be an enormous mistake
to speak to Amber

23:01.240 --> 23:02.560
about Rayanne's drinking problem.

23:02.640 --> 23:06.040
It would just make matters worse.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.560
Well, I love you, too.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.640
Now... please... shut... up.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.720
I will.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.440
So you want to make love?
I mean, you know...

23:24.560 --> 23:25.600
since we're up.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.920
Well, speak for yourself.

23:31.600 --> 23:35.480
Well, just close your eyes...

23:35.560 --> 23:38.560
and be very, very brave.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.640
Oh.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.920
Hi.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.360
Hi.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.120
So listen, I just wanna say,

23:45.200 --> 23:47.920
like, I had no idea
Rayanne was going to show up at the loft.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.800
And when I said that thing about her...

23:49.880 --> 23:52.040
you know, the idea of her
being in the band...

23:52.720 --> 23:55.640
I just want to make sure
you didn't feel pressured or anything.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.480
Not that you would feel that way.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.040
But in case you... you did.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.720
I mean, you know,
it's up to you, obviously, so...

24:02.800 --> 24:05.240
-She's in.
-What?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.160
She's in the band.

24:09.320 --> 24:12.200
-Oh, you mean...
-Okay. It wasn't my idea.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.040
It was his.

24:14.680 --> 24:19.680
This whole thing is getting too weird.
I got to go.

24:19.760 --> 24:23.960
(upbeat music playing)

24:24.040 --> 24:27.560
Angeleeka, I'm in! I'm an Embryo!

24:28.400 --> 24:29.560
Or whatever you want to call it!

24:29.640 --> 24:30.920
Hey, Rayanne.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.240
-Yeah. I heard. That's really great.
-Hey, Rayanne, you coming?

24:35.160 --> 24:37.200
I got to go. I'll see you later.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.720

25:06.560 --> 25:08.920
(telephone ringing)

25:24.000 --> 25:27.440
-What?
-Amber, hi. It's Patty Chase.

25:27.520 --> 25:30.000
Angela's mom. Did I wake you?

25:30.600 --> 25:34.000
No. I always sound like this. (coughs)

25:37.320 --> 25:39.440
I was just having a dream about Angela.

25:39.520 --> 25:43.960
Her and her boyfriend and Raynnie and me
were in this, like, log cabin.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.600
Oh, if you mean Jordan Catalano,
he's not her boyfriend.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.560
They've decided just to be friends.

25:50.720 --> 25:51.840
Yeah, right.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.040
<i>Anyway, so they were all</i>
<i>in this featherbed,</i>

25:55.120 --> 25:59.520
and I was making pancakes
for George Bush, of all people.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.600
-So, Pat, what's up?
-Nothing. Um...

26:04.480 --> 26:07.280
I just... I just wondered
how things are going with Rayanne.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.680
Well, she's on the wagon,
so she's completely no fun anymore.

26:10.760 --> 26:13.040
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>
<i>I'm very proud of her.</i>

26:13.120 --> 26:15.640
Oh, did Angela tell you
she'll be singing in Jordan's band?

26:15.720 --> 26:18.320
(chuckles) Yes. So I hear.

26:18.920 --> 26:23.960
So, um, you're certain
that she's not drinking.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.600
About as certain as you are that Angela
and cutie-pie are just friends.

26:33.200 --> 26:36.120
I... I think I hear my other phone.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.480
What a coincidence. Me, too.

26:43.120 --> 26:44.280
One, two, three, four.

-Let's go.

27:10.360 --> 27:15.320
(rock music continues playing)

27:15.920 --> 27:18.160
-Hey, Pullman, turn your amp down.
-What?

27:18.240 --> 27:19.680
Catalano, tell him to turn his amp down.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.280
Don't tell Catalano to tell me.
You tell me.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.280
-I just told you.
-Forget it.

27:23.360 --> 27:25.960
-This is exactly why Tino left. Exactly.
-Hey!

27:26.040 --> 27:27.760
You know, maybe you should
stop worrying about me

27:27.840 --> 27:29.120
and try to keep a beat.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.640
That's it!

27:31.840 --> 27:33.240
I'm out of here, too, man.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.440
Hey, Graff.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.360
The Vertigo guy called.
Our audition's tonight.

27:44.440 --> 27:45.520
What?

27:45.960 --> 27:47.840
Yeah. So try to think of a name.

27:48.680 --> 27:50.320
Forget a name. We're not ready.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.920
You'll do okay.
Just wear something tight.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.320
That's your solution,
cut off my circulation?

27:59.960 --> 28:01.520
We need a real rehearsal.

28:01.600 --> 28:05.360
Look, you wanted this chance,
you got it. Don't blow it.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.520
So can I still borrow the boots?

28:10.600 --> 28:12.080
Oh, absolutely.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.360
So, I really hope I can come. It's just...

28:14.440 --> 28:16.440
No, it's okay. If you can't, you can't.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.320
You know, I... It's... You know...
They have this whole thing with...

28:19.400 --> 28:21.760
It's okay. Rickie invited,
like, half the school.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.840
Seriously?

28:23.840 --> 28:25.800
I'm definitely going to try to go.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.240
So, what song are you singing again?

28:33.280 --> 28:37.840
Angela... I don't know.
They never told me.

28:43.000 --> 28:46.000
Rayanne... Rayanne, what are you doing?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.800
Rayanne, no. Please, no, no.
It's not worth it.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.520
-Please.
-Just to get me through tonight.

28:51.200 --> 28:52.640

28:53.520 --> 28:56.960

-Yeah.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.720
Me, too. Even more than when I served
that BLT to Bobby Dylan.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.360
He said I could call him Bobby.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.480
-And then he stiffed you.
-Come here, baby.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.200
Honey, your little hands are like ice.

29:37.280 --> 29:41.000
I know. My heart is beating, like, a lot,
and I can hardly breathe.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.000
Oh, sweetheart, are you all right?

29:43.080 --> 29:46.800
-You're scared, aren't you? Oh, no!
-No, no. Are you kidding?

29:47.640 --> 29:49.080

29:49.920 --> 29:52.280
This is going to be the most amazing night
of my life.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.960
Anyway, that was the conversation.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.840
Yeah. I'll bet she doesn't even have
a second phone.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.280
So? Neither do we.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.440
Well, that's not the point. I mean... Hi.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.440
There's this thing tonight
at this coffee house, Vertigo,

30:13.520 --> 30:16.440
and I promised Rayanne
I'd ask you if I could go, but...

30:16.880 --> 30:20.760
I don't... I don't even really want to go,
and I feel so guilty.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.560
See, she's... She's singing,
um, with this band that...

30:25.440 --> 30:27.560
All right, fine.
It's Jordan Catalano's band,

30:27.640 --> 30:32.280
but this has nothing to do with Jordan
or the fact that we broke up or anything.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.800
That's what's so weird.

30:33.880 --> 30:39.240
It's something between Rayanne and me
that I can't even describe.

30:39.320 --> 30:42.320
But it's there,
and it's been there for, like, a while,

30:42.840 --> 30:46.200
since that night when you had to drive her
to the hospital.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.720
It's this thing that we never talk about.

30:51.040 --> 30:54.080
So these are mine? Thanks.
I was kind of low on clean socks.

30:56.600 --> 30:57.760
Thanks for listening.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.840
It's okay. She'll ignore you
for another month just to make up for it.

31:06.960 --> 31:07.960
I know.

31:10.160 --> 31:15.600
(rock music playing)

31:29.920 --> 31:31.400
Hey.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.640
What are you doing here?

31:37.360 --> 31:38.920
What am I doing here?
You begged me to come.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.960
Oh! Oh, right, right.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.040
I had this fear that...

31:44.520 --> 31:46.360
that there would be, like, no audience.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.640
So I just started asking anyone.

31:48.720 --> 31:52.280
Oh! Thank you.
That really makes me feel wonderful.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.240
-Are you, like, sick or something?
-Oh, no, um...

31:58.960 --> 32:02.080
This always happens when I get nervous.
I lose my voice.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.600
Oh, so Rayanne's singing,
and you get the laryngitis?

32:04.680 --> 32:06.760
(clears throat) Listen, um...

32:07.560 --> 32:10.960
when she starts singing, you can't talk,
but, like, afterwards...

32:11.960 --> 32:15.000
applaud, but not too much,
but, like, sincerely.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.400
-You're telling me how to applaud.
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.880
I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.720
I got to pray now.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.160
I'm just going to introduce you
and then come on.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.640
Is this on?

32:29.720 --> 32:31.720
(mic screeching)

32:31.800 --> 32:33.240
(clears throat) Um...

32:33.640 --> 32:37.240
Uh, welcome to Club Vertigo,
uh, Open Mic Night.

32:37.320 --> 32:40.360
The first group is, um, called, uh,

32:40.440 --> 32:43.240
um... "frozen," uh... This was...

32:43.320 --> 32:44.960
-Uh, that's not our name.
-What is this?

32:45.040 --> 32:49.560
-"Embers"?
-We're, uh, Between Names.

32:50.360 --> 32:51.920
Between Names.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.520
-All right, Between Names.
-Shut up, man. We're not finish.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.640
-Did you hear what she called us?
-I'm sorry.

32:57.720 --> 32:58.840
-Just shut up.
-I'm sorry.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.480
-You shut up.
-I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.800
-Go ahead. Say hi.
-Hi, every...

33:14.880 --> 33:17.080
(mic screeching)

33:17.600 --> 33:19.160
This is Rayanne's first time.

33:20.200 --> 33:21.880
I mean, singing with us.

(telephone ringing)

36:06.920 --> 36:07.920
Hello.

36:09.040 --> 36:10.040
Rickie...

36:10.760 --> 36:12.040
What is it?

36:12.120 --> 36:14.800
Rickie, please calm down.
I can't understand what you're saying.

36:16.480 --> 36:18.600
Rickie, it's Angela's mom.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.720
Start at the beginning.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
-Amber.
-Yes!

36:32.320 --> 36:34.360
-Hi. Patty... Chase.
-Hi.

36:34.440 --> 36:37.040
-Angela's mom.
-Yes. I know who you are.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.200
You know, you don't have to keep
reintroducing yourself.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.960
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to barge in
on you like this.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.120
I tried calling, but, uh...

36:47.200 --> 36:51.840
You know, I think we could be
part of the same karass...

36:51.920 --> 36:54.960
you and Angela, me and Rayanne
and Rickie.

36:55.040 --> 36:58.040
-Part of what?
-A karass.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.120
A karass is a group of people

37:00.200 --> 37:03.480
who kind of get mixed up
in each other's lives

37:03.560 --> 37:05.640
in order to do God's will.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.280
It was in <i>Cat's Cradle </i>by Kurt Vonnegut.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.200
Amber, um...
Rayanne's been drinking again.

37:13.760 --> 37:17.040
-Do you have any idea...
-She has not been drinking.

37:17.120 --> 37:20.920
Amber, I found a glass on our bar
with whiskey in it.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.960
What did you do,
dust for prints, run a DNA test?

37:24.040 --> 37:25.400
That's not the point.

37:25.480 --> 37:27.280
You don't think I know my own kid?

37:28.520 --> 37:29.960
How well do you know Angela?

37:31.560 --> 37:34.920
I know that Rayanne is missing.
Rickie called me last night.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.720
He was hysterical.

37:37.920 --> 37:38.920
Listen, I...

37:39.560 --> 37:42.040
I know that this is completely
inappropriate, okay?

37:42.120 --> 37:45.520
I... I know that it is not my place
to tell you how to raise your daughter.

37:45.600 --> 37:48.600
But... I can't help it. I'm involved.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.520
Okay? Whether you like it or not.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.360
And you can hate me

37:52.440 --> 37:57.680
but I can't just stand by
and watch this girl destroy herself.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.120
Is somebody going to turn
that damn thing off?

38:02.200 --> 38:03.240
Rayanne?

38:03.320 --> 38:05.840
(boiler steaming)

38:05.920 --> 38:07.640
(Patty) Oh, I don't understand.

38:07.720 --> 38:11.320
I... I don't under...
Rickie said that you were gone.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.960
She was right here, of course.
Where else would she be?

38:15.040 --> 38:18.600
We ate raw cookie dough,
and we turned the phone off.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.440
-You don't have to go to school today.
-No, I want to.

38:22.520 --> 38:25.600
Poor Rickie probably had,
like, 14 heart attacks.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.640
I could give her a ride to school.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.080
I'll write her a late note.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.880
I'm a good mother.

38:46.280 --> 38:47.320
I'm a damn good mother,

38:47.400 --> 38:49.960
so you can just get right off
your high horse.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.880
(birds chirping)

38:55.800 --> 38:57.600
Just so you know, I, uh...

38:57.680 --> 39:00.920
I didn't drink that whiskey.
I poured it back.

39:01.720 --> 39:02.800
You can ask Angela.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.320
You haven't had one drink
since that night in the hospital?

39:07.240 --> 39:09.520
Nope. Swear to God.

39:10.520 --> 39:13.680
Why didn't you tell me that you had
stopped seeing your counselor?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.920
I don't know. Maybe just 'cause...

39:17.160 --> 39:18.800
I wanted you to think I was okay.

39:18.880 --> 39:23.200
So you wouldn't mind if I, you know,
stayed friends with Angela.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.920
I guess she means a lot to you, huh?

39:30.360 --> 39:33.800
I guess that's, like, the one thing
you and I have in common.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.800
-Okay.
-(bell rings)

39:40.920 --> 39:42.120
Thanks for the ride, Mrs. Chase.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.040
-Rayanne...
-Yo.

39:44.120 --> 39:47.880
Apparently, you and I
are in the same karass.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.880
Call me Patty.

39:50.960 --> 39:54.680
(upbeat music playing)

39:54.760 --> 39:56.720
Patty, thanks.

39:58.600 --> 39:59.720
For, like...

40:01.520 --> 40:02.400
my life.

40:10.080 --> 40:13.760
(indistinct chatter)

40:13.840 --> 40:16.280
Rickie! Rickie, wait!

40:18.600 --> 40:20.360
Here. I was late. Rickie, wait!

40:20.440 --> 40:23.960
-Rickie, come on! Stop! Rickie, come on!
-Don't!

40:24.760 --> 40:26.040
Do not touch me!

40:26.120 --> 40:28.360
-Rickie, come on.
-No! I can't anymore!

40:29.160 --> 40:31.760
You don't know how scared I was.
I thought you were dead.

40:31.840 --> 40:35.720
I was picking out clothes
I should wear to your funeral.

40:39.040 --> 40:42.080
-Rickie, that hurt.
-Not enough.

40:44.160 --> 40:49.240
(mellow music playing)

40:57.880 --> 40:58.880
Hi.

41:05.160 --> 41:06.800
I've never been out here before.

41:09.520 --> 41:11.480
So Rickie was really scared.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.200
I mean, I was, too.

41:22.240 --> 41:26.680
So, what, you're mad at me
'cause I didn't get to hear you sing?

41:28.840 --> 41:31.600
You didn't miss much.
Just me making a fool out of myself.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.000
And you've seen that plenty. Right?

41:35.480 --> 41:37.080
I mean, I knew you wouldn't show.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.840
I can't stand these looks anymore.

41:44.440 --> 41:45.680
What looks?

41:46.320 --> 41:49.040
You and Rickie looking at me
like I'm going to lose control,

41:49.120 --> 41:53.160
like any minute, I'm going to go on
some jag or something.

41:54.320 --> 41:56.880
I just can't stand knowing
what you're thinking about me.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.520
What? What am I thinking?

41:59.160 --> 42:00.360
I messed up.

42:03.080 --> 42:05.160
That I'm too messed up
for you to be my friend anymore.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.040
Rayanne, that's not true. I never...

42:10.240 --> 42:12.240
I'm still your friend.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.360
Nothing's changed.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.320
(Angela) <i>But that wasn't</i>
<i>completely true either...</i>

42:23.320 --> 42:26.320
<i>and we both, like, knew it.</i>

42:26.400 --> 42:29.280
(serene music playing)

42:29.360 --> 42:32.160
Maybe it was just easier, you know...

42:33.440 --> 42:36.800
when you'd come to me
for advice and stuff,

42:37.400 --> 42:39.000
like you used to before.

42:40.000 --> 42:45.080
(serene music playing)

42:49.440 --> 42:53.080
I should have been there... last night.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.680
I should have been there for you
no matter what.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.280
Miss you.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.600
I know.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.200
I missed you, too.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.680
Rickie, I'm sorry.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.840
I swear to God I'm going to kill you.

43:21.920 --> 43:27.040
(tranquil music playing)

43:31.600 --> 43:33.800
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.680
Excuse me. Pardon me.

43:37.040 --> 43:38.400
We're not cutting, okay?

43:38.480 --> 43:40.760
-We were, like, here before.
-He was, like, saving our place.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.120
God! I worship this movie.

43:42.200 --> 43:45.480
-Is James Dean, like, Italian?
-Jordan Catalano is part Italian.

43:45.560 --> 43:48.640
-I told you not to mention him.
-Okay.

43:48.720 --> 43:50.840
-I like Latin guys.
-Like me?

43:51.800 --> 43:53.560
Like Andy Garcia.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.520
Oh, my God! In that movie
where that girl is blind.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.440
Oh, I know!

43:56.520 --> 43:59.280
What's his name? What's his name?
What's his name? Luis!

43:59.360 --> 44:01.000
-Who is Luis?
-Who is Luis?

44:02.840 --> 44:05.640
You know, the guy on <i>Sesame Street</i>
with the repair shop.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.760
What? Luis is, like, this genius, okay?

44:09.840 --> 44:13.840
-He can fix, like, anything.
-You are so crazy.

44:13.920 --> 44:17.720
I don't care. I like <i>Sesame Street.</i>
I still watch it every day.

44:17.800 --> 44:21.040
Oh, I used to love their songs.
What was that one? Umm...

44:21.120 --> 44:24.080

44:24.160 --> 44:26.720
