WEBVTT

00:48.908 --> 00:49.908
You ready?

00:51.443 --> 00:54.346
Oh Barb, give
it a fucking rest, please.

00:54.379 --> 00:56.716
I swear to God
if I didn't have these kids,

00:56.749 --> 00:59.652
I would jump out of
this car right now.

00:59.686 --> 01:01.821
Go ahead, don't
let me stop you, woman.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.691
Stop the fucking car.

01:04.724 --> 01:06.224
Just once, just once.

01:06.258 --> 01:08.326
How does it do it, Nathan?

01:08.360 --> 01:09.762
What do you mean?

01:11.463 --> 01:13.766
How does the moon
stay in the same place

01:13.800 --> 01:15.567
while we're moving?

01:16.803 --> 01:18.236
It's so big, sis.

01:19.504 --> 01:21.641
It's just that big.

01:21.674 --> 01:22.541
Oh, there it was.

01:22.574 --> 01:24.744
- I'm in, I lost.
- He's doing it again.

01:24.777 --> 01:27.714
God, you're such
a selfish you know what.

01:27.747 --> 01:29.414
Starts with a C.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.890
You guys,
that's not where that goes.

01:37.924 --> 01:41.761
And up and
over and side to side.

01:41.794 --> 01:43.663
Can I get some more
helping hands, please?

01:43.696 --> 01:45.898
Abby, this is a
very important achievement.

01:45.932 --> 01:47.009
- Of course.
- What are we gonna do?

01:47.033 --> 01:48.835
You know what else is doable?

01:48.868 --> 01:50.402
We're gonna feed the chicken.

01:50.435 --> 01:51.475
- Feed the chicken.
- Okay,

01:51.503 --> 01:52.705
final hugs for dad.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.876
Hugs, hugs.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.577
Great.

01:58.610 --> 02:00.312
All right, outside to play.

02:00.345 --> 02:01.279
I don't want to.

02:01.313 --> 02:02.014
Excuse me?

02:02.048 --> 02:03.281
There's nothing to do.

02:03.315 --> 02:04.050
Are you kidding me?

02:04.083 --> 02:05.785
When I was your age,

02:05.818 --> 02:08.054
I didn't have any of those
jungle gym, fancy things.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.722
I mean-

02:09.756 --> 02:11.466
- You want us to have the
same crappy childhood you had?

02:11.490 --> 02:13.358
Really?

02:13.391 --> 02:14.937
- Don't encourage it.
- Abigail, it's fine.

02:14.961 --> 02:15.862
Relax.

02:15.895 --> 02:18.430
"Abigail, it's fine, relax."

02:18.463 --> 02:20.867
All right guys outside,
I will call you later.

02:21.868 --> 02:23.535
You know,

02:23.568 --> 02:25.379
can you grab that bookcase
at the top of the stairs

02:25.403 --> 02:26.615
that you've been
meaning to grab?

02:26.639 --> 02:28.708
Because Davis really
wants it at your house

02:28.741 --> 02:30.609
and it's heavy and
taking up space,

02:30.643 --> 02:32.712
and also uniforms,
softball uniforms.

02:32.745 --> 02:33.846
If you got a pair,

02:33.880 --> 02:35.490
then I wouldn't have to be
washing them all the time.

02:35.514 --> 02:36.314
I will do
the bookcase next time.

02:36.348 --> 02:37.582
Oh, can't talk to Mom.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.794
Ab, I will do the
bookcase next time.

02:38.818 --> 02:39.919
I'm kind of in a rush.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.320
You just did 25 minutes
of handshakes with the boys,

02:42.354 --> 02:43.689
you can't take,

02:43.723 --> 02:44.489
Abigail.

02:44.523 --> 02:45.523
Okay, fine.

02:46.525 --> 02:48.560
Oh, look at that, it's your mom.

02:48.593 --> 02:49.962
Nope.

02:49.996 --> 02:51.764
I take it you still
haven't spoken to her

02:51.798 --> 02:53.800
about not calling me as
if we aren't divorced.

02:53.833 --> 02:54.634
I forgot.

02:54.667 --> 02:55.600
I'll get to it.

02:55.635 --> 02:56.635
- Please do.
- Mm hm.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.973
God, relentless.

03:01.007 --> 03:02.607
Hey, bye, good luck with that.

03:02.642 --> 03:03.676
Mom.

03:03.709 --> 03:04.753
I have to
tell you about the pillow.

03:04.777 --> 03:05.978
No, no, Ma.

03:06.012 --> 03:07.122
I can't talk about
pillows right now.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.489
I just got the boys back and
we're getting settled in.

03:08.513 --> 03:10.016
Okay, okay, okay.

03:10.049 --> 03:14.954
But we should talk because,
interesting, Dad fell again.

03:15.487 --> 03:15.922
Again?

03:15.955 --> 03:17.023
Is he okay?

03:17.056 --> 03:18.490
Yes, he's okay.

03:18.523 --> 03:21.393
Why do you sound so
annoyed, Abigail?

03:21.426 --> 03:23.129
Oh, also interesting,

03:23.162 --> 03:26.565
he almost drowned during
his pool therapy session,

03:26.598 --> 03:28.010
so that might've made
him out of sorts.

03:28.034 --> 03:30.468
Mom, what do you
mean almost drowned?

03:30.502 --> 03:31.502
Yeah.

03:32.638 --> 03:34.140
- Yeah?
- What?

03:34.173 --> 03:36.374
I said almost.

03:36.408 --> 03:38.711
He's on the floor
and can't get up.

03:38.744 --> 03:39.946
Interesting.

03:39.979 --> 03:41.580
- What?
- Well, he's comfortable.

03:41.613 --> 03:43.883
Do you think I would leave
him there if he wasn't?

03:43.916 --> 03:45.985
Ma, how long has he
been on the floor for?

03:46.018 --> 03:48.553
A few hours, maybe more.

03:48.587 --> 03:50.422
What do you think,
I'm a monster?

03:50.455 --> 03:51.423
Ma.

03:51.456 --> 03:54.827
Boys, get inside the house.

03:54.861 --> 03:56.095
- Hi, JD.
- Hi, JD.

03:56.128 --> 03:58.898
Hey, boys, I've got ice cream.

03:58.931 --> 04:01.067
Mom, they don't need ice cream.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.468
Abigail, I raised two children.

04:03.501 --> 04:05.872
Do you think I don't know
how to feed children?

04:06.772 --> 04:08.074
It'd just be nice if
you asked me

04:08.107 --> 04:09.942
before you pumped
my kids with sugar.

04:09.976 --> 04:11.911
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

04:11.944 --> 04:13.179
What's going on here?

04:13.212 --> 04:14.790
Well, I was trying to
sit down and I missed it.

04:14.814 --> 04:16.015
I see that.

04:16.048 --> 04:16.949
Let me help you.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.617
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

04:18.651 --> 04:20.552
Careful, Abigail,
you'll get another hernia.

04:20.585 --> 04:21.787
I'm fine, Mom.

04:21.821 --> 04:22.821
I'm okay.

04:23.756 --> 04:24.623
Here, you could-

04:24.657 --> 04:25.925
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

04:25.958 --> 04:26.959
Okay.

04:26.993 --> 04:28.027
- Yup.
- Yeah.

04:29.762 --> 04:30.830
How's that?

04:30.863 --> 04:32.098
Feel balanced?

04:32.131 --> 04:33.065
Will you sit on
the couch with me?

04:33.099 --> 04:34.099
- Of course.
- Thanks.

04:38.004 --> 04:39.038
Sometimes I,

04:41.573 --> 04:42.573
I can't,

04:43.943 --> 04:45.111
I can't get my balance.

04:49.048 --> 04:50.716
I don't know what's going on.

04:51.918 --> 04:53.028
That's what we're
trying to figure out

04:53.052 --> 04:54.186
with the doctors, okay?

04:55.655 --> 04:57.622
Get everything moving
the way you want it to.

04:57.657 --> 04:58.657
Okay.

05:00.126 --> 05:01.827
How was pool therapy?

05:01.861 --> 05:02.929
Oh, well I...

05:07.033 --> 05:09.101
Abby, I couldn't feel my feet.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.104
Never happened to me before.

05:15.908 --> 05:19.011
I felt like
I was falling backwards

05:19.045 --> 05:22.048
and then I tried to right myself

05:22.081 --> 05:27.019
and I just kind of
tumbled in the pool.

05:27.987 --> 05:28.987
Okay.

05:30.089 --> 05:31.791
Ma really shouldn't
be leaving you.

05:31.824 --> 05:33.159
Oh no, no, no.

05:33.192 --> 05:36.528
Don't, don't, don't
be hard on her.

05:36.561 --> 05:38.764
She's doing a
terrific job, Abby.

05:38.798 --> 05:42.635
Abby, she is the best
wife anyone could have.

05:43.535 --> 05:44.535
Okay.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.077
Have you told your
brother about me?

05:52.044 --> 05:54.046
Euge, he doesn't give a shit.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.114
Ma.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.583
- You can tell me.
- I know.

05:58.616 --> 06:00.920
I just, I haven't
really said much to him

06:00.953 --> 06:02.722
in the last couple of years.

06:02.755 --> 06:04.824
He's a son of a bitch.

06:04.857 --> 06:06.225
Ma.

06:06.258 --> 06:07.860
I'll be right back, hold on.

06:09.228 --> 06:11.630
You are not helping.

06:11.664 --> 06:14.266
Well, when you've had your
son cut you out of their life

06:14.300 --> 06:18.070
for 20 years, then you can
tell me how to do this.

06:18.104 --> 06:19.105
- Hey, Hey.
- Yeah,

06:19.138 --> 06:20.172
- what, honey?
- No, no,

06:20.206 --> 06:21.207
I want Abby.

06:22.341 --> 06:23.642
Ah.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.977
Okay then.

06:25.011 --> 06:26.712
Knock yourself out.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.082
- This isn't me.
- I know.

06:34.153 --> 06:35.587
I love you.

06:35.620 --> 06:36.621
Thank you.

06:39.058 --> 06:40.292
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

06:41.761 --> 06:43.996
Eugene, I'm home.

06:46.265 --> 06:48.768
Yoohoo, where are you?

06:48.801 --> 06:50.002
Be right there, Barb.

07:06.085 --> 07:07.153
- Who do I love?
- Us.

07:07.186 --> 07:08.220
Who tastes like sugar?

07:08.254 --> 07:09.155
We are.

07:09.188 --> 07:10.188
All right.

07:24.303 --> 07:25.104
Perfect.

07:25.137 --> 07:25.971
Good night.

07:26.005 --> 07:27.139
I love you.

07:27.173 --> 07:28.606
- Love you.
- Good night.

07:28.641 --> 07:30.009
Good night, Mama.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.977
Good night, Grape.

07:32.011 --> 07:32.878
Say good night to Matthew.

07:32.912 --> 07:34.313
Good night Matthew.

07:34.346 --> 07:35.346
All right.

07:36.215 --> 07:39.285
- Night.
- Night, mama.

07:39.318 --> 07:41.120
See you in the morning.

07:45.391 --> 07:46.759
Sweet dreams.

08:03.175 --> 08:04.310
Boys, breakfast.

08:08.013 --> 08:08.814
- Ew.
- Here you go.

08:08.848 --> 08:10.216
What's that smell?

08:10.249 --> 08:11.884
Is something burning, Mom?

08:11.917 --> 08:13.152
Oh, shit.

08:13.185 --> 08:14.220
It's the sausage.

08:14.253 --> 08:15.254
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.322
God dammit.

08:18.357 --> 08:19.959
Language, Mama.

08:19.992 --> 08:22.928
I mean, you don't need that.

08:22.962 --> 08:24.263
You don't need that.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.231
You have beautiful
pancakes and strawberries

08:25.264 --> 08:27.900
with lots of anti-oxidants,
great for you.

08:27.933 --> 08:28.834
- Eat.
- Mama,

08:28.868 --> 08:30.369
what's that beep, beep, beeping?

08:30.402 --> 08:31.804
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

08:31.837 --> 08:32.972
Banana bread.

08:33.005 --> 08:34.182
- Banana bread.
- Remember last week

08:34.206 --> 08:35.241
when you burnt it?

08:35.274 --> 08:37.276
Burned it, not burnt it.

08:38.210 --> 08:39.445
Daddy never burns breakfast.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.347
Well, can Dada make banana bread

08:41.380 --> 08:43.349
that's beautiful like this?

08:43.382 --> 08:44.382
Yes.

08:48.821 --> 08:49.855
- Hi.
- Morning.

08:49.889 --> 08:50.889
Come on in.

08:53.292 --> 08:54.093
Banana bread?

08:54.126 --> 08:55.261
Fresh out of the oven.

08:55.294 --> 08:56.838
- Oh no, I'm good.
- Hey, that's for us.

08:56.862 --> 08:57.862
Shut it.

08:58.364 --> 08:59.999
No, I'm good, thank you.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.001
I need the garage clicker.

09:02.034 --> 09:04.036
Oh yeah, of course.

09:04.069 --> 09:05.404
Of course, where is it?

09:06.805 --> 09:08.049
One of those things
that, you know,

09:08.073 --> 09:09.384
you should really put in
a safe place every time,

09:09.408 --> 09:11.911
'cause that is
where you find it.

09:11.944 --> 09:12.944
But um,

09:13.445 --> 09:14.813
- ow.
- Careful.

09:14.847 --> 09:15.414
That's sharp.

09:15.447 --> 09:16.815
I'm fine, really.

09:18.117 --> 09:18.918
Right here.

09:18.951 --> 09:19.885
Here you go.

09:19.919 --> 09:21.253
Thanks.

09:21.287 --> 09:22.388
- Great.
- I'll be working

09:22.421 --> 09:23.989
on the fountain if you need me.

09:25.257 --> 09:26.825
Of course.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.933
What?

09:33.966 --> 09:35.334
Hey, Daddy's here.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.367
Oh.

09:37.403 --> 09:39.104
You're early.

09:39.138 --> 09:40.439
Dada.

09:40.472 --> 09:42.308
- Traffic was light.
- Mmm.

09:42.341 --> 09:43.809
Did you boys do your homework?

09:43.842 --> 09:45.020
- Course it was.
- Did you practice

09:45.044 --> 09:45.477
- your violin, Dave?
- No, and no.

09:45.511 --> 09:46.946
And I tried.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.290
I really tried, so
that's on you now.

09:48.314 --> 09:49.181
It's all good, buddy.

09:49.215 --> 09:51.283
Grab your hoodies,
boys, it's zoo day.

09:52.484 --> 09:54.453
They really ate none
of their breakfast.

09:54.486 --> 09:55.888
What's up with your mom?

09:55.921 --> 09:57.356
She's been texting me a ton.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.958
It's been kind of weird.

09:58.991 --> 10:00.402
Didn't they make
her start some meds?

10:00.426 --> 10:02.103
Yeah, well she feels
that she doesn't need them.

10:02.127 --> 10:03.529
It's everybody
else that's crazy.

10:03.562 --> 10:05.331
Well, you told her
to stop calling me.

10:05.364 --> 10:07.333
- Thank you.
- Uh huh.

10:07.366 --> 10:09.301
But now she needs
to stop texting me.

10:09.335 --> 10:10.936
We've been divorced for a year.

10:10.970 --> 10:12.271
All right, yeah.

10:12.304 --> 10:13.304
I get it.

10:14.106 --> 10:16.041
Hey, boychiks, kisses for Mama.

10:16.075 --> 10:17.142
I'm gonna miss you.

10:17.176 --> 10:18.944
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye.

10:18.978 --> 10:20.546
Have so much fun at the zoo.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.014
- See ya.
- Snacks for them?

10:22.047 --> 10:23.182
Yes.

10:23.215 --> 10:24.116
Okay.

10:24.149 --> 10:25.749
- Bye, mama.
- Of course you have snacks.

10:26.318 --> 10:27.386
Jesus Christ.

10:30.522 --> 10:31.924
Ma, what?

10:31.957 --> 10:33.225
Call the caregiver agency.

10:33.259 --> 10:35.194
I gotta fire another one.

10:35.227 --> 10:37.363
No, no, no, no,
no, Mom, not Shawn.

10:37.396 --> 10:38.430
What's going on?

10:38.464 --> 10:41.166
Oh, wait till you hear this one.

10:47.573 --> 10:52.511
Shawn, you were brought into
this house to protect him,

10:52.544 --> 10:54.847
not to bring him poison.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.348
Mrs. Frey, it's not poison.

10:56.382 --> 10:57.349
- Medicinal marijuana.
- Oh please.

10:57.383 --> 10:58.450
Has been proven to help-

10:58.484 --> 11:01.353
- Who do you think
you're talking to?

11:01.387 --> 11:04.123
I went through the '60s.

11:05.024 --> 11:06.458
Barely.

11:06.492 --> 11:09.495
I was taking mescaline before
you were even in diapers.

11:09.528 --> 11:11.230
So give me a break.

11:11.263 --> 11:12.264
He asked me for it.

11:12.298 --> 11:16.335
It is a drug and I
don't want it in my house.

11:16.368 --> 11:20.005
Mrs. Frey, I care
about your family.

11:20.039 --> 11:21.039
Very deeply.

11:22.007 --> 11:25.978
Spare me the pain.

11:26.011 --> 11:27.579
Just get out, Shawn.

11:27.613 --> 11:31.150
In fact, get out and
take your bears with you.

11:31.183 --> 11:32.351
Whoa, whoa, Mom, stop.

11:32.384 --> 11:34.853
- I want you out.
- Shawn, what's happening?

11:34.887 --> 11:36.889
Mom, stop with the bears.

11:36.922 --> 11:37.856
I can't do this.

11:37.890 --> 11:39.158
- We can talk.
- I'm sorry.

11:39.191 --> 11:40.292
Remember the last time?

11:40.326 --> 11:41.994
Hey, stop it.

11:42.027 --> 11:43.028
I'll call you.

11:45.597 --> 11:47.499
This turnover is killing me.

11:47.533 --> 11:48.533
What did he do?

11:49.568 --> 11:51.003
Well,

11:51.036 --> 11:53.238
he was giving your
father marijuana

11:53.272 --> 11:54.940
in the form of
cute little bears.

11:54.973 --> 11:55.941
Oh my God, mom.

11:55.974 --> 11:57.976
He was one of the good ones.

11:58.010 --> 12:00.346
Call the service,
get another one.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.517
I'm very happy we have
this appointment today

12:05.551 --> 12:10.422
because he's getting worse.

12:10.456 --> 12:12.257
Ma, this is how this works.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.425
It gets worse.

12:13.459 --> 12:16.895
And this morning he fell again,

12:18.964 --> 12:20.933
and I could barely pick him up.

12:23.102 --> 12:27.206
He was like a dead weight.

12:28.708 --> 12:29.708
Shawn?

12:31.644 --> 12:33.512
I need Shawn.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.280
Hey, honey.

12:36.448 --> 12:37.449
Hi, Dad.

12:39.719 --> 12:40.619
Hi.

12:40.653 --> 12:41.653
Hi.

12:45.524 --> 12:46.525
I need to pee.

12:49.361 --> 12:50.361
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:51.163 --> 12:52.464
Abby.

12:52.498 --> 12:54.199
Your dad needs your help.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.401
But I'm in a hurry.

12:56.468 --> 12:57.970
I'll be in the car.

12:59.672 --> 13:01.641
Whoopsy Daisy, too late.

13:03.208 --> 13:06.412
Huh.

13:06.445 --> 13:07.346
Cut it out.

13:07.379 --> 13:08.580
Dad said not to make noise.

13:08.614 --> 13:09.649
Shut up.

13:13.152 --> 13:14.520
I'm serious, Nathan.

13:14.553 --> 13:16.054
Cut it out.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.289
Cut it out.

13:17.322 --> 13:19.002
- He's gonna be mad.
- "He's gonna be mad."

13:20.492 --> 13:22.094
Hey!

13:22.127 --> 13:23.462
Abby, what did I tell ya?

13:31.303 --> 13:34.641
So, I can't seem
to get my balance.

13:34.674 --> 13:36.108
Everything seems to be-

13:36.141 --> 13:37.976
- Follow my finger, please.
- Everything

13:39.178 --> 13:40.312
is failing on me.

13:42.548 --> 13:44.416
I feel a little weak.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.417
Just with the eyes.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.286
- Huh?
- How's work?

13:47.319 --> 13:48.520
It's fine.

13:48.554 --> 13:51.590
When are they going to tell
you about that cover story?

13:53.258 --> 13:55.294
I just don't think they
think I'm quite ready yet.

13:55.327 --> 13:56.995
Well, that's ridiculous.

13:57.029 --> 14:00.432
I mean, you didn't get an MFA
to be writing staff pieces

14:00.466 --> 14:01.300
this long.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.002
Veronica's
daughter-in-law has an MSA

14:04.036 --> 14:07.272
and she says you absolutely
should have a cover now.

14:07.306 --> 14:09.408
Great, well I am not
Veronica's daughter-in-law.

14:09.441 --> 14:12.578
You have to say what
you want, Abigail.

14:12.611 --> 14:15.247
It's not quite like that, Ma.

14:15.280 --> 14:18.484
This point, there's really
nothing else to do, I'm afraid.

14:23.355 --> 14:25.257
Nothing else to do?

14:25.290 --> 14:27.660
Abigail, help me out here.

14:27.694 --> 14:29.595
I don't think Dr.
Ashkenazi understands.

14:29.629 --> 14:31.163
It's Ashkenazi, Mom.

14:31.196 --> 14:32.699
It's fine.

14:32.732 --> 14:34.767
We need another set of tests.

14:34.801 --> 14:37.336
We need, we need a specialist.

14:37.369 --> 14:38.580
- He is a specialist.
- I am a specialist.

14:38.604 --> 14:39.739
Dr. Ashkenazi.

14:39.772 --> 14:41.206
Your next patient's ready.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.675
Excuse me?

14:42.709 --> 14:44.644
- Ma.
- She serious?

14:44.677 --> 14:46.245
I'll be right there.

14:46.278 --> 14:47.388
Doctor, I've been
trying to tell my parents

14:47.412 --> 14:49.816
that it's not safe for them
to be living on their own

14:49.849 --> 14:51.083
without full-time care.

14:51.116 --> 14:52.251
We don't need it.

14:52.284 --> 14:53.686
You call me every time he falls.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.721
Not true.

14:54.754 --> 14:57.623
I called 911 twice this week.

14:57.657 --> 14:58.725
Mrs. Frey,

14:58.758 --> 15:00.727
you need to consider hiring
a full-time caregiver.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.528
You're going to end
up hurting yourself.

15:02.561 --> 15:04.296
We need a fourth opinion.

15:04.329 --> 15:07.099
The thing about life is that
there are no second chances

15:07.132 --> 15:09.401
to be the you that
you're meant to be.

15:09.434 --> 15:11.603
What's holding you back?

15:11.638 --> 15:14.641
Now is the time for you to
break through those limits.

15:16.475 --> 15:17.475
Whoa.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.579
Shit.

15:20.612 --> 15:21.613
You're good.

15:22.614 --> 15:23.850
You're good.

15:23.883 --> 15:25.685
You have to be
willing to take a risk

15:25.718 --> 15:27.386
and take that step.

15:27.419 --> 15:30.389
'Cause no one else is
going to do it for you.

15:30.422 --> 15:32.157
You have to work.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.559
Now is the time.

15:34.526 --> 15:37.797
It's all about you
taking that next step.

15:38.798 --> 15:43.135
Visualize yourself and
who you wanna become.

15:43.168 --> 15:45.270
You have to take control.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.477
You've reached the
voicemail of Hannah White,

15:52.511 --> 15:54.446
Editor-in-Chief of Modern Jew.

15:54.479 --> 15:56.148
Leave a message, I'll
return your call.

15:56.181 --> 15:58.216
Hey, boss lady.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.819
Hannah Banana.

15:59.852 --> 16:03.555
I'm sorry, but you
know, just little busy.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.391
This is Abigail
Frey, by the way.

16:06.425 --> 16:09.328
So listen, so many
things to say,

16:09.361 --> 16:10.529
my dad's dying.

16:10.562 --> 16:12.497
I mean, everybody is dying,

16:12.531 --> 16:16.703
but some quicker than others.

16:16.736 --> 16:19.772
And my mom is not,

16:20.673 --> 16:21.908
I mean,

16:24.176 --> 16:27.446
can I petition for a new mom?

16:27.479 --> 16:30.515
There's some fun
stuff to talk about.

16:30.549 --> 16:33.452
There's this guy, a man,

16:33.485 --> 16:38.891
gardening my garden
and he is delightful.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.361
So we can talk about that.

16:42.394 --> 16:43.730
About haircuts.

16:43.763 --> 16:45.230
I need one.

16:45.263 --> 16:46.264
Bangs,

16:47.199 --> 16:48.266
no bangs?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.300
I mean...

16:54.439 --> 16:57.677
So, give me a call

16:57.710 --> 16:58.778
whenever.

16:58.811 --> 16:59.811
I'm here.

17:04.483 --> 17:07.252
Dance clubs just
giving it their all today.

17:07.285 --> 17:09.722
Whoa, look at those kicks.

17:09.756 --> 17:11.758
These girls
worked so hard all year

17:11.791 --> 17:14.393
just to get a chance to walk.

17:20.432 --> 17:21.432
Ma.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.300
Ma.

17:24.771 --> 17:25.771
Ma?

17:28.540 --> 17:29.809
What?

17:29.842 --> 17:32.344
- What, I'm fine.
- We're almost ready.

17:32.377 --> 17:34.479
I needed to take a little nap.

17:35.347 --> 17:36.716
Where's your father?

17:37.616 --> 17:38.851
He's not up yet.

17:38.885 --> 17:40.953
Eugene, what are you doing?

17:43.321 --> 17:46.726
Your brother said he
would call with Karen.

17:46.759 --> 17:49.862
I told him, you know,
come have a meal with us,

17:49.896 --> 17:54.767
but she's sure has her
claws in him, doesn't she?

17:54.801 --> 17:55.968
Mom, can we just go one day

17:56.002 --> 17:58.437
without you tearing into Karen?

17:58.470 --> 18:00.405
Excuse me.

18:00.439 --> 18:02.240
Look, who's a Saint.

18:12.819 --> 18:14.553
What do you think?

18:14.586 --> 18:15.922
Why are you wearing those shoes?

18:15.955 --> 18:16.956
I'm in a good mood.

18:16.989 --> 18:18.457
Can't I be in a good mood?

18:18.490 --> 18:19.792
It's a new year.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.661
- Oh man.
- What?

18:21.694 --> 18:24.030
All right, here's why
I'm in a good mood.

18:24.063 --> 18:26.598
It's New Year's, it's vacation,

18:26.632 --> 18:29.769
I don't have to work tomorrow,
and I just got stoned.

18:29.802 --> 18:31.269
Happy New Year, Barbara.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.006
What?

18:34.040 --> 18:35.440
- What?
- No.

18:35.474 --> 18:36.709
What?

18:36.743 --> 18:38.310
I've been denying
this for 20 years.

18:38.343 --> 18:39.611
I am so sick and tired.

18:39.645 --> 18:41.681
I ain't going to
deny it anymore.

18:41.714 --> 18:42.982
I smoke weed.

18:43.015 --> 18:43.950
Come on, let's eat.

18:43.983 --> 18:44.984
Abby, sit down.

18:45.017 --> 18:46.719
Abigail, do
not touch that chair.

18:46.753 --> 18:48.988
Abby, sit down, let's eat.

18:49.021 --> 18:50.288
- Right.
- Ooh.

18:50.322 --> 18:51.456
Ooh.

18:51.490 --> 18:53.793
Ooh, look what
you've made for me.

18:53.826 --> 18:54.961
It's my favorite.

18:54.994 --> 18:56.662
It's pasta primavera.

18:56.696 --> 18:57.596
Oh, oh.

18:57.630 --> 18:58.640
- Thank you.
- I know that.

18:58.664 --> 18:59.664
What?

19:01.433 --> 19:02.902
- Aw, shit.
- Now you can

19:02.935 --> 19:05.638
make your own dinner for the
rest of your fucking life.

19:05.671 --> 19:07.305
Oh, Barbie,
give it a fucking break.

19:07.339 --> 19:10.877
You drink, you drink, you
drink, I smoke a joint.

19:10.910 --> 19:11.944
What?

19:17.683 --> 19:20.953
Peter, this stupid
fucking bookcase.

19:38.704 --> 19:40.438
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.608
- How are you?
- Okay.

19:44.543 --> 19:45.978
What are you doing out here?

19:46.012 --> 19:46.813
Where's Darrin?

19:46.846 --> 19:47.947
Darrin?

19:47.980 --> 19:51.017
Meeting, I think,
us at the doctor.

19:51.050 --> 19:51.984
Okay.

19:52.018 --> 19:55.054
Your mother said
that I should stay here

19:55.087 --> 19:56.923
'cause I was too
much in the way.

19:56.956 --> 19:58.691
I hate being such a burden.

19:58.724 --> 20:00.358
Abigail, you're here already.

20:00.392 --> 20:02.394
- Here I am.
- Do you know

20:02.427 --> 20:05.998
I have just made the most
incredible flatbread?

20:06.032 --> 20:09.902
I used those dry chickpeas
from the Armenian market.

20:09.936 --> 20:12.939
The one the seamstress at the
dry cleaner told us about,

20:12.972 --> 20:16.508
the dry cleaner who's having
an affair with her hairdresser,

20:16.541 --> 20:18.678
but who still reads your column.

20:18.711 --> 20:19.979
That is so kind.

20:20.012 --> 20:23.883
All right, let's get
Dad to this appointment.

20:23.916 --> 20:25.127
We're gonna do it in the Walker.

20:25.151 --> 20:26.484
Why?

20:26.518 --> 20:27.920
Well, he's got to try it.

20:27.954 --> 20:29.889
- I can try it.
- Yeah.

20:29.922 --> 20:31.523
Let me take this.

20:31.556 --> 20:32.901
Dad, I think you should
use the wheelchair.

20:32.925 --> 20:34.994
- He can try the Walker.
- I could try it.

20:35.027 --> 20:37.730
Ma, he's very weak.

20:37.763 --> 20:39.165
Honey, it's okay.

20:39.198 --> 20:40.666
I'm okay.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.868
I know what I'm doing.

20:42.902 --> 20:44.070
Okay, let's try the Walker.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.905
- Okay.
- All right.

20:47.974 --> 20:48.774
Not too fast.

20:48.808 --> 20:50.076
Yeah, that's it.

20:51.077 --> 20:52.577
Uh oh.

20:52.611 --> 20:53.946
- Uh oh.
- How you feel?

20:53.980 --> 20:54.914
Not too good.

20:54.947 --> 20:55.815
Come on, we'll go back down.

20:55.848 --> 20:57.415
Okay.

20:57.449 --> 20:59.151
- There.
- Okay, Abigail.

21:03.789 --> 21:05.858
Whoa, hey.

21:05.892 --> 21:07.660
I will take care of this.

21:09.128 --> 21:11.097
This stupid thing.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.131
All right.

21:17.103 --> 21:18.671
Want me to do this?

21:18.704 --> 21:19.704
No, I can do it.

21:20.840 --> 21:23.109
Yeah, but I don't
have my feet ready.

21:23.142 --> 21:24.442
Oh.

21:24.476 --> 21:26.544
Oh, shoot.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.445
Sorry.

21:27.479 --> 21:28.479
Sorry.

21:29.782 --> 21:30.782
Oh God.

21:34.987 --> 21:36.488
I don't like you to bend.

21:36.521 --> 21:37.589
I know, I'm sorry.

21:38.758 --> 21:40.126
Okay, great.

21:40.159 --> 21:41.426
Don't let her bend.

21:42.728 --> 21:43.728
Okay, Dad.

21:44.630 --> 21:45.497
You sure you don't want-

21:45.530 --> 21:46.666
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

21:48.200 --> 21:52.570
You know, Darrin's girlfriend
is 20 and she's pregnant.

21:52.604 --> 21:56.008
How are we going to
stop this endless cycle?

21:56.042 --> 21:58.443
- Watch out.
- Whoopsy Daisy.

22:00.545 --> 22:01.714
I'm fine, Abigail.

22:01.747 --> 22:02.982
I'm fine.

22:03.015 --> 22:04.016
Everybody's fine.

22:22.969 --> 22:26.072
Did you get a chance to
look at that dating app?

22:26.105 --> 22:27.073
'Cause it's time.

22:27.106 --> 22:29.008
Peter's already seeing people.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.743
How on earth do
you know that, Ma?

22:30.776 --> 22:32.645
Well, you told me
I couldn't call him

22:32.678 --> 22:33.846
and I couldn't text him,

22:33.879 --> 22:36.882
but you didn't say I couldn't
follow him on Facebook.

22:36.916 --> 22:38.284
Can we just pay attention

22:38.317 --> 22:39.885
to what the doctor is saying?

22:39.919 --> 22:41.553
Sorry.

22:41.586 --> 22:42.755
Okay. Mr. Frey,

22:42.788 --> 22:44.166
let's see how you
can walk on your own.

22:44.190 --> 22:45.825
Walking is hard for me.

22:45.858 --> 22:48.094
Dad, it's okay,
we're all here for you.

22:48.127 --> 22:49.862
Let me get you started Mr. F.

22:51.063 --> 22:52.665
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

22:52.698 --> 22:55.634
He's like the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.

22:55.668 --> 22:56.969
Ma.

22:57.003 --> 22:59.038
Okay, Mr. Frey,
let's try that again.

22:59.071 --> 23:00.538
You're all right.

23:00.572 --> 23:01.573
I got you, Mr. F.

23:01.606 --> 23:02.606
Now.

23:11.817 --> 23:13.185
How are you, Mrs. Frey?

23:13.219 --> 23:15.855
How should I be, Dr. Pastel?

23:15.888 --> 23:17.289
It's Dr. Patel, Mom.

23:17.323 --> 23:18.324
It's fine.

23:18.357 --> 23:21.160
Abigail. I would like
you to tell Dr. Patel

23:21.193 --> 23:22.294
about your father.

23:22.328 --> 23:25.031
She has training in medicine.

23:25.064 --> 23:26.866
I took a couple of
courses in college,

23:26.899 --> 23:29.001
just basic stuff.

23:29.035 --> 23:30.236
Now she's writing.

23:30.269 --> 23:32.238
She's writing a column
for the Modern Jew.

23:32.271 --> 23:33.806
It's very popular,

23:33.839 --> 23:36.275
but because she doesn't
ask for what she wants,

23:36.308 --> 23:38.911
she hasn't been given
a cover story yet.

23:38.944 --> 23:40.212
- Ma.
- Right.

23:42.214 --> 23:44.050
He's not been eating.

23:44.083 --> 23:46.852
He wets the bed most nights.

23:46.886 --> 23:48.220
He's really not very lucid.

23:48.254 --> 23:52.291
And he is getting
worse day by day.

23:54.326 --> 23:58.164
His chiropractor thinks
maybe meditation would help.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.232
Mm-hmm.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.935
Mrs. Frey,

24:02.968 --> 24:04.804
I'm going to be blunt.

24:04.837 --> 24:06.815
I know you're continuing to
make appointments weekly,

24:06.839 --> 24:09.175
but your husband is not
going to get better.

24:11.143 --> 24:15.714
So, do you mean we
brought him to a doctor,

24:15.748 --> 24:18.084
to a hospital, where
they can't fix him?

24:18.117 --> 24:19.285
Mom.

24:19.318 --> 24:21.329
He's gonna continue to decline
at a more rapid rate now.

24:21.353 --> 24:23.756
And we need to
talk about hospice.

24:23.789 --> 24:24.690
Hospice.

24:24.723 --> 24:25.658
What is that?

24:25.691 --> 24:27.693
Hospice means we
don't think he can live

24:27.726 --> 24:29.662
longer than six months.

24:29.695 --> 24:32.198
He's gotta eat more.

24:32.231 --> 24:34.166
Maybe if you gave him an enema,

24:34.200 --> 24:37.069
it would make room
for more food.

24:37.103 --> 24:39.004
No, Mrs. Frey.

24:39.038 --> 24:41.307
You have to stop trying
to force him to eat.

24:41.340 --> 24:44.276
If he doesn't
eat, he's gonna die.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.178
Yes, Ma, he's going to die.

24:52.351 --> 24:55.620
Oh my God.

24:59.091 --> 25:02.328
We just figured out his Lipitor.

25:03.429 --> 25:04.429
Ma, what?

25:05.931 --> 25:08.934
We finally figured
out the dosage

25:08.968 --> 25:11.137
and now he's going to die.

25:11.170 --> 25:13.005
Ma, now is not
the time to be thinking

25:13.038 --> 25:14.807
about his Lipitor, okay?

25:25.217 --> 25:27.953
Nathan used to work
in that building.

25:30.156 --> 25:31.156
Remember?

25:33.292 --> 25:35.361
We visited him once,

25:35.394 --> 25:40.232
and I think we took a very
nice walk in the garden there.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.140
- Remember?
- Yeah.

25:51.944 --> 25:53.312
I remember.

26:32.117 --> 26:34.119
Get back here.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.721
Cut it out.

26:36.355 --> 26:37.790
Do you wanna tap out?

26:37.823 --> 26:40.059
No, I do not wanna tap out.

26:40.092 --> 26:41.794
Guys, take this in another room.

26:43.229 --> 26:45.264
If you really love
him, then you'll save him.

26:45.297 --> 26:46.799
She does love me.

26:46.832 --> 26:48.400
And she will save me.

26:48.434 --> 26:51.003
Guys, other room, please.

26:53.839 --> 26:55.450
- Get back here, you troll.
- Don't call me a troll,

26:55.474 --> 26:57.977
- you troll.
- I'm not done with you.

27:00.312 --> 27:01.480
Hey, Abbs.

27:01.513 --> 27:03.215
Sorry I haven't
answered your calls.

27:03.249 --> 27:04.249
Here's the thing.

27:05.251 --> 27:05.951
I don't know if I
want Mom and Dad

27:05.985 --> 27:07.786
at my birthday party next week.

27:09.188 --> 27:13.392
No matter what I do,
I can't get space from them.

27:13.425 --> 27:15.394
- Get what?
- What, space?

27:15.427 --> 27:16.795
What does that mean?

27:16.829 --> 27:18.330
You know what it means.

27:18.364 --> 27:20.032
Remember when we sent the thing.

27:20.065 --> 27:21.367
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.302
Such disrespect
when he did that.

27:23.335 --> 27:25.137
If I would have told my father-

27:25.170 --> 27:27.539
- Oh, Eugene, stop
with the father.

27:27.573 --> 27:30.476
It's not always
about your father.

27:30.509 --> 27:33.145
Okay, hey, do you want
me to finish or not?

27:33.178 --> 27:34.380
Yeah, go.

27:34.413 --> 27:36.015
Okay.

27:36.048 --> 27:37.049
Karen's parents

27:37.082 --> 27:39.985
so generously offered
to throw me this party.

27:40.019 --> 27:42.054
Oh, I know what's comin'.

27:42.087 --> 27:43.255
- You do?
- Oh yeah.

27:43.289 --> 27:44.590
Just listen, go ahead.

27:44.623 --> 27:48.460
I think you all coming
to my party without mom

27:48.494 --> 27:50.229
apologizing to Karen

27:50.262 --> 27:52.031
- for what happened.
- What?

27:52.064 --> 27:52.965
Is not gonna work.

27:52.998 --> 27:53.565
There it is, I knew it.

27:53.599 --> 27:55.134
Are you kidding?

27:55.167 --> 27:56.368
- That's it.
- Ma,

27:56.402 --> 27:57.336
what happened with Karen?

27:57.369 --> 27:58.537
Oh please.

27:58.570 --> 28:01.307
Her grandmother turned 100.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.942
I didn't go to the celebration

28:03.976 --> 28:08.447
because I can't be all things
to all people, Abigail.

28:08.480 --> 28:09.481
You're absolutely right.

28:09.515 --> 28:10.883
Thank you.

28:10.916 --> 28:13.352
Okay, Ma, can you
just apologize to Karen?

28:13.385 --> 28:14.420
Apologize?

28:14.453 --> 28:16.488
Wh, why?

28:16.522 --> 28:17.489
We're not apologizing.

28:17.523 --> 28:19.024
It was a busy week.

28:19.058 --> 28:20.125
Sue me.

28:20.159 --> 28:21.927
Over my dead fuckin' body.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.863
Over my dead fuckin' body
is anyone in this family

28:24.897 --> 28:28.033
fucking apologizing to
go to that fucking party?

28:33.439 --> 28:35.607
I think we should say hello.

28:35.642 --> 28:37.409
- Now?
- Yeah.

28:37.443 --> 28:38.577
I talked to them.

28:38.610 --> 28:39.611
- I told them.
- And?

28:39.646 --> 28:40.879
They had to be polite.

28:40.913 --> 28:41.913
Okay.

28:46.151 --> 28:49.621
- Hello, family.
- Happy birthday.

28:49.656 --> 28:51.957
- Okay, thank you.
- Hi, Karen.

28:51.990 --> 28:54.126
Mom, Dad.

28:54.159 --> 28:55.994
Nathan, happy birthday.

28:57.129 --> 28:58.129
Thanks.

29:06.171 --> 29:07.171
Dad?

29:18.984 --> 29:21.620
Have you put on a little weight?

29:29.629 --> 29:31.530
You're still a troll.

29:31.563 --> 29:34.099
I swear if you ask
me one more time,

29:34.133 --> 29:36.468
I am going to throw
you into a wall.

29:36.502 --> 29:37.436
Just cut it out.

29:37.469 --> 29:38.537
You're so annoying.

29:40.038 --> 29:44.176
Can you bring
us a snack please, Mom?

29:44.209 --> 29:45.544
Yes, I'll be right there.

29:45.577 --> 29:46.445
I'll be right there.

29:46.478 --> 29:48.046
Okay.

29:48.080 --> 29:53.085
God, I-

29:58.223 --> 29:59.223
Hello?

30:00.592 --> 30:02.961
Hey, what's up?

30:05.364 --> 30:06.666
I just, uh,

30:08.500 --> 30:10.637
I wanted to talk
to you about Dad.

30:10.670 --> 30:13.005
He has a degenerative condition

30:13.038 --> 30:14.973
and we've had to
put him on hospice.

30:16.542 --> 30:18.711
Oh, okay.

30:20.647 --> 30:21.681
Yeah.

30:23.582 --> 30:25.551
I don't really know
what else to say.

30:26.653 --> 30:27.687
Well,

30:31.223 --> 30:32.357
I'm glad you told me.

30:34.159 --> 30:37.029
If you wanted to
start thinking about,

30:37.062 --> 30:38.163
you know um,

30:39.064 --> 30:40.064
if you,

30:41.634 --> 30:42.468
I don't know.

30:42.501 --> 30:44.570
It might be the last.

30:44.603 --> 30:46.639
Yeah, no, I get it.

30:46.673 --> 30:47.673
I get it.

30:48.574 --> 30:49.508
I am sorry.

30:49.541 --> 30:51.043
I know you're probably at work

30:51.076 --> 30:54.046
and so you probably need
time to think about this.

30:54.079 --> 30:56.248
No, no, it's fine.

30:56.281 --> 30:58.685
I mean, I kind of have a
good amount of distance

30:58.718 --> 30:59.718
from all of this.

31:00.653 --> 31:02.588
It's been so long, so.

31:06.659 --> 31:09.061
I'll be down there
in a couple of weeks.

31:09.094 --> 31:09.796
- What?
- Yeah.

31:09.829 --> 31:11.230
I'm the distinguished lecturer

31:11.263 --> 31:12.799
at the College of
Art and Design,

31:12.832 --> 31:15.467
the horticulture
of the Meiji era.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.670
Being a specialist
matters, I guess.

31:17.704 --> 31:19.271
Yeah, I'm sure.

31:21.607 --> 31:27.579
So, I mean, I don't want
to commit to anything, but-

31:27.613 --> 31:30.249
- But there's a
chance you might come see him?

31:30.282 --> 31:31.450
Well, I don't know, Abigail.

31:31.483 --> 31:32.494
I'm just saying
I'll be down there.

31:32.518 --> 31:33.418
It's a long drive.

31:33.452 --> 31:35.387
So it depends on timing and-

31:35.420 --> 31:38.691
- Yeah, okay.
- Bunch of stuff I have to do.

31:38.725 --> 31:40.158
Should I come?

31:40.192 --> 31:41.260
What?

31:41.293 --> 31:43.595
You know, to your lecture?

31:43.630 --> 31:44.764
Should I come?

31:46.231 --> 31:47.165
What?

31:47.199 --> 31:48.233
No, nevermind.

31:49.601 --> 31:50.737
No, yeah.

31:50.770 --> 31:51.770
Come.

31:52.672 --> 31:53.740
That's cool.

31:53.773 --> 31:55.407
Yeah?

31:55.440 --> 31:57.777
Yeah, I'll
send you the information.

31:57.810 --> 31:58.810
Okay.

32:00.747 --> 32:01.747
Okay, bye.

32:02.581 --> 32:03.581
Bye.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.788
Mom?

32:10.622 --> 32:11.658
Yes, I'm coming.

32:12.692 --> 32:14.593
Yeah, we have had conversation.

32:14.626 --> 32:17.764
This is what, my job is
an hour away from here.

32:17.797 --> 32:20.465
It makes no sense for me
to live at home anymore.

32:20.499 --> 32:21.701
Come on.

32:21.734 --> 32:23.201
Oh, don't come on with me, kid.

32:23.235 --> 32:25.437
I worked my ass off so you
can live here rent-free.

32:25.470 --> 32:26.271
- Dad.
- What?

32:26.305 --> 32:27.205
Calm down.

32:27.239 --> 32:28.140
Don't tell me to calm down.

32:28.173 --> 32:29.341
I'm fuckin' calm, Abby.

32:29.374 --> 32:30.552
- This is calm.
- You want things to be

32:30.576 --> 32:31.620
like they were when
you were my age.

32:31.644 --> 32:33.646
And it's just not
like that anymore.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.624
Well, when I was your age,
if I would've told my father

32:35.648 --> 32:38.651
I want to live on my own, but
he should keep paying my rent,

32:38.685 --> 32:39.762
he would have smacked me so hard

32:39.786 --> 32:41.520
I'd have lost all
the teeth in my head

32:41.553 --> 32:42.755
and I woulda deserved it, kid.

32:42.789 --> 32:43.866
Karen and I are getting serious.

32:43.890 --> 32:45.490
- Karen!
- Karen, who?

32:45.524 --> 32:46.258
Who is?

32:46.291 --> 32:47.402
- My girlfriend.
- Is she behind

32:47.426 --> 32:48.728
the whole moving thing?

32:48.761 --> 32:50.630
- What?
- You think that we don't

32:50.663 --> 32:52.564
get what's going on, Nate?

32:52.598 --> 32:53.398
We do.

32:53.432 --> 32:54.533
We know you want to live

32:54.566 --> 32:58.270
in some bachelor pleasure den.

32:58.303 --> 32:59.438
Oh, Ma, stop.

32:59.471 --> 33:00.606
Shut up, Abby.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.642
You think I want to
move out so I can have sex

33:02.675 --> 33:04.309
- with Karen?
- Yeah.

33:04.343 --> 33:06.646
Well, news flash,
we already have.

33:06.679 --> 33:08.447
- What?
- Oh Jesus.

33:08.480 --> 33:09.281
Oh God.

33:09.314 --> 33:10.783
Everyone has sex.

33:10.817 --> 33:12.761
You're the only people who
refuse to acknowledge that

33:12.785 --> 33:15.253
because you're so out
of touch with reality.

33:15.287 --> 33:16.865
It's like you're living
in the Dark Ages.

33:16.889 --> 33:18.490
Do not yell at your mother.

33:18.523 --> 33:20.860
I'm so Sick of your
authoritarian bullshit, Dad!

33:20.893 --> 33:21.928
I'm warning you.

33:21.961 --> 33:23.295
Nathan, your father is

33:23.328 --> 33:24.372
- busting his ass-
- Stop, stop,

33:24.396 --> 33:25.564
stop defending him.

33:25.597 --> 33:27.599
You gave up your life
to be his servant.

33:27.634 --> 33:28.500
And I am tired of
shutting up about the fact

33:28.533 --> 33:30.670
that you love him
more than you love us.

33:30.703 --> 33:31.603
Stop, stop, Dad, please.

33:31.638 --> 33:32.805
Where are you goin'?

33:32.839 --> 33:34.741
Where are you goin'?

33:34.774 --> 33:36.375
Get out of here!

33:36.408 --> 33:37.810
Talking to your
mother like that.

33:37.844 --> 33:38.844
Get out.

33:39.846 --> 33:41.480
Get out of here,
get out of here.

33:41.513 --> 33:43.650
- You're not so smart, Nathan.
- Get outta here.

33:43.683 --> 33:44.760
- Fuckin' dicks, man.
- You don't know anything.

33:44.784 --> 33:46.194
- You're flinchin', huh?
- Get out of,

33:46.218 --> 33:47.252
get the hell out.

33:47.285 --> 33:48.688
Where you goin'?

33:48.721 --> 33:50.188
- I just-
- No,

33:50.222 --> 33:52.222
you're not goin' anywhere,
we're gonna have dinner.

33:54.861 --> 33:55.861
Okay.

33:56.595 --> 33:58.263
So, what should we talk about?

33:58.296 --> 33:59.296
Abby?

34:00.232 --> 34:01.734
Have a nice day today?

34:03.736 --> 34:04.871
Ah.

34:14.579 --> 34:15.782
Hello.

34:15.815 --> 34:16.916
Hi.

34:16.949 --> 34:17.750
You're early.

34:17.784 --> 34:18.951
Hello, Miss Abigail.

34:20.352 --> 34:22.254
You could call me
Abby at this point.

34:22.287 --> 34:23.287
Abby.

34:24.289 --> 34:26.391
- Short for Abigail.
- Yeah, no, I got it.

34:26.425 --> 34:27.860
Of course you do.

34:27.894 --> 34:30.730
I mean, I'm pretty sure
I said it'd be around noon.

34:31.864 --> 34:32.864
And look at that.

34:33.900 --> 34:35.434
It is noon.

34:35.467 --> 34:36.936
- It is.
- Thought it was not,

34:36.969 --> 34:38.638
but it is.

34:38.671 --> 34:40.272
Can I take this out for you?

34:40.305 --> 34:42.642
Trade you my empty water
bottle for the trash?

34:42.675 --> 34:46.813
Sure, but I can fill
this with water for you.

34:46.846 --> 34:48.848
That is the thing
that could happen.

34:48.881 --> 34:49.982
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

34:50.016 --> 34:51.383
- Yup.
- Yup.

34:52.517 --> 34:54.486
Well, I will be right back.

34:54.519 --> 34:55.519
Okay.

34:56.656 --> 34:57.656
All right.

35:09.068 --> 35:10.870
Here you go.

35:10.903 --> 35:12.404
- Thank you.
- No problem.

35:14.473 --> 35:16.876
So, cupcakes.

35:16.909 --> 35:17.909
Uh huh.

35:18.610 --> 35:22.414
Yup, that is what I am doing.

35:26.853 --> 35:29.021
Uh, Mom, I can't
really talk right now

35:29.055 --> 35:30.823
- because I have people over.
- Oh my God,

35:30.857 --> 35:33.793
did you know if you sleep
with your mouth open

35:33.826 --> 35:37.063
and don't swallow enough,
you get sores in your mouth?

35:37.096 --> 35:38.030
Mom.

35:38.064 --> 35:39.031
Your father has so many sores.

35:39.065 --> 35:39.832
Mom, Mom.

35:39.866 --> 35:42.534
- Mom.
- Because his swallow reflex

35:42.567 --> 35:43.770
is so messed up.

35:43.803 --> 35:45.403
Ma I can't talk right now.

35:45.437 --> 35:46.571
I have somebody over here.

35:46.605 --> 35:47.874
- Okay?
- Oh.

35:47.907 --> 35:49.842
Since, when do you
have people there?

35:49.876 --> 35:51.077
- Ma, I was just.
- Hey.

35:51.110 --> 35:53.746
Hello there, muscles.

35:53.780 --> 35:54.680
Hello yourself.

35:54.714 --> 35:55.915
I'm Jay, the landscaper.

35:55.948 --> 35:56.816
You really don't
have to do this.

35:56.849 --> 35:58.084
Oh, I don't mind.

35:58.117 --> 35:59.919
I see where Abigail
gets her good looks.

35:59.952 --> 36:01.020
- Oh wow.
- Jay,

36:01.053 --> 36:03.656
flattery will get
you everywhere.

36:03.689 --> 36:06.092
I've got some landscaping
I could use some help with.

36:06.125 --> 36:08.527
Oh my God, I want to die.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.362
- Just a sec.
- Okay, okay.

36:10.395 --> 36:12.597
Abigail, your father
needs that stuff

36:12.632 --> 36:14.734
that makes water
easier to swallow.

36:14.767 --> 36:16.535
He's gagging and drooling.

36:16.568 --> 36:18.871
Ma, I'm gonna
call you back later.

36:18.905 --> 36:19.939
Okay?

36:22.607 --> 36:23.910
Mm.

36:23.943 --> 36:25.745
Moms, right?

36:25.778 --> 36:27.847
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.548
Ma, are our cupcakes done yet?

36:29.581 --> 36:31.483
Yeah. I'm working on it.

36:31.516 --> 36:33.518
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

36:33.552 --> 36:34.452
I'll get outta here.

36:34.486 --> 36:35.554
- Get to work.
- Okay.

36:37.657 --> 36:38.758
Jay?

36:38.791 --> 36:40.960
- Yeah?
- I,

36:40.993 --> 36:44.864
huh, you might not
want to do this,

36:44.897 --> 36:48.734
but I have some extra
tickets to this lecture

36:48.768 --> 36:51.904
on magical Japanese gardens.

36:51.938 --> 36:54.506
You know, you are a landscaper.

36:54.539 --> 36:56.909
Meiji era is what this is about.

36:56.943 --> 36:59.846
And you know, maybe you might-

36:59.879 --> 37:03.049
- Wow, that is a
very specific topic.

37:03.082 --> 37:04.082
I know.

37:05.718 --> 37:06.919
Yeah, sure, sounds good.

37:06.953 --> 37:08.420
When is it?

37:08.453 --> 37:09.689
Tomorrow?

37:09.722 --> 37:10.923
Tomorrow?

37:10.957 --> 37:12.397
What, you think I
had no other plans?

37:13.726 --> 37:14.694
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

37:14.727 --> 37:17.997
No, I don't
have any other plans.

37:19.598 --> 37:20.598
Okay.

37:21.734 --> 37:22.935
Okay.

37:22.969 --> 37:25.171
I should also tell you that
the lecturer is my brother.

37:25.204 --> 37:28.107
He's a professor and
this is his specialty.

37:28.140 --> 37:31.443
So it is going to be him there.

37:31.476 --> 37:32.621
I haven't seen him
in a long time,

37:32.645 --> 37:34.947
so it's kind of a big deal.

37:34.981 --> 37:36.849
Wow, so first I
flirt with your mom,

37:36.883 --> 37:38.093
now you want me to
meet your brother?

37:38.117 --> 37:39.628
Yeah, I'd like you
to forget about that.

37:39.652 --> 37:43.089
But this might be a
terrible idea as well.

37:43.122 --> 37:44.132
So just don't worry about it.

37:44.156 --> 37:45.091
You know what?

37:45.124 --> 37:48.060
Let's add in Sushi
before and it's a deal.

37:49.996 --> 37:51.030
Okay.

37:51.063 --> 37:52.064
Okay.

37:52.098 --> 37:53.398
- Great.
- Cool.

37:55.067 --> 37:56.468
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:06.712 --> 38:08.814
The forest

38:10.149 --> 38:11.149
was caps.

38:14.921 --> 38:16.155
You're talking silly talk.

38:35.141 --> 38:36.776
I worked so goddamn hard,

38:36.809 --> 38:39.577
for every day of
my fuckin' life,

38:39.611 --> 38:41.113
and this is the thanks I get?

38:41.147 --> 38:42.748
Abby.

38:42.782 --> 38:44.183
Abby, Abby, honey.

38:44.216 --> 38:45.617
Sweetie, sweetie pie, wake up.

38:45.651 --> 38:47.053
Wake up, wake up.

38:47.086 --> 38:47.853
Come on, we gotta get up.

38:47.887 --> 38:50.522
- What's goin' on?
- We gotta go.

38:50.555 --> 38:52.058
We gotta go, put your shoes on.

38:52.091 --> 38:53.092
Why?

38:53.125 --> 38:53.926
Come on.

38:53.960 --> 38:54.760
'Cause we have to.

38:54.794 --> 38:55.928
Hurry up.

38:55.962 --> 38:56.862
I'm gonna get Nathan.

38:56.896 --> 38:57.763
Come on, sweetie, come on.

38:57.797 --> 38:58.798
- Okay.
- Okay.

38:58.831 --> 39:01.566
Barbara, you
are such a selfish cunt.

39:03.102 --> 39:06.038
I don't need any of this shit.

39:06.072 --> 39:08.207
Oh, you're taking them away.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.275
Go ahead.

39:09.308 --> 39:12.712
Go ahead, see if I fuckin' care.

39:19.218 --> 39:21.087
Daddy just needs to cool off.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.121
You know how he gets.

39:22.154 --> 39:24.556
He's under a lot
of stress at work.

39:36.102 --> 39:38.037
Okay, you guys,

39:38.070 --> 39:39.147
I'll see you in the
morning, sweetie.

39:39.171 --> 39:40.940
- No.
- I love you.

39:40.973 --> 39:41.973
No.

39:42.975 --> 39:44.176
Don't go.

39:44.210 --> 39:45.210
Love you.

39:57.356 --> 39:59.258
- Nate?
- What?

40:01.160 --> 40:03.662
- Where's the moon?
- What?

40:04.897 --> 40:05.731
Where is it?

40:05.765 --> 40:07.299
It's not in the sky.

40:07.333 --> 40:08.634
Oh.

40:08.667 --> 40:09.802
It's called a new moon.

40:12.271 --> 40:13.271
Go to sleep.

40:18.144 --> 40:20.079
Are Mom and Dad gonna be okay?

40:25.151 --> 40:26.952
I don't know, sis.

40:26.986 --> 40:27.987
I don't know.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.288
Go to sleep.

40:46.672 --> 40:47.740
Hey, there you are.

40:47.773 --> 40:49.108
Hi.

40:49.141 --> 40:50.976
I am so sorry that I am late.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.654
I'd like to tell you that
I'm not typically late,

40:52.678 --> 40:55.281
but I am always late and it
is not because I value my time

40:55.314 --> 40:56.248
more than yours.

40:56.282 --> 40:58.284
It's just, I put things places,

40:58.317 --> 40:59.617
and then I can't find them,

40:59.652 --> 41:02.221
things that are
important like the keys.

41:02.254 --> 41:03.222
I'm sorry.

41:03.255 --> 41:04.757
It's okay.

41:04.790 --> 41:05.991
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:18.904 --> 41:20.139
I'm gonna get started here.

41:20.172 --> 41:21.407
Please take your seats.

41:23.142 --> 41:25.744
Well, feel like
I'm back in college.

41:27.313 --> 41:29.248
Thought you didn't
go to college.

41:29.281 --> 41:31.784
Wow, not used to
dates who listen.

41:31.817 --> 41:33.018
Here today.

41:33.052 --> 41:36.188
You can you can hear me, right?

41:36.222 --> 41:38.257
- This is on-
- God.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.892
I'm Nathaniel Frey.

41:39.925 --> 41:41.393
I mean, he looks
exactly like my dad.

41:41.427 --> 41:45.431
The College of Art and Design
is very close to my heart.

41:45.464 --> 41:47.433
So let's just jump in.

41:47.466 --> 41:49.201
If we can get the lights.

41:51.036 --> 41:53.205
The Meiji Period
is one which has.

41:54.740 --> 41:55.674
Okay, so what do we do?

41:55.708 --> 41:56.442
This is who they are.

41:56.475 --> 41:57.843
Nathan, you should have heard

41:57.877 --> 41:59.111
what she was saying in there.

41:59.145 --> 42:01.247
Abby, you have to get
yourself out of there.

42:02.348 --> 42:03.348
- Nate.
- One sec.

42:06.752 --> 42:08.287
Abbs, I gotta go.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.321
Get out of there.

42:09.355 --> 42:10.256
What am I suppose to do?

42:10.289 --> 42:12.224
How am I supposed to?

42:14.326 --> 42:15.127
- Nathan.
- Do what you need to,

42:15.161 --> 42:16.095
do what you need to.

42:16.128 --> 42:17.163
- I gotta go.
- Nathan.

42:17.196 --> 42:21.967
Is best left to the gods
and not the gardeners.

42:30.910 --> 42:32.378
I'll meet you at the car?

42:32.411 --> 42:33.345
Okay.

42:33.379 --> 42:34.379
Good luck.

42:35.314 --> 42:37.216
- Okay.
- So thank you guys.

42:48.327 --> 42:49.327
Hey.

42:51.130 --> 42:52.798
Do we hug?

42:52.831 --> 42:53.831
Okay.

42:55.834 --> 42:57.245
That was so cool to
see you in action.

42:57.269 --> 42:58.237
You're so passionate.

42:58.270 --> 42:59.805
Thank you, thank you.

42:59.838 --> 43:02.041
You're just really
well versed and all.

43:02.074 --> 43:04.052
Yeah, they asked me to do
this lecture and I was like,

43:04.076 --> 43:06.378
I just did this at the
University of Tokyo.

43:06.412 --> 43:08.380
So I wasn't even sure
I wanted to come.

43:08.414 --> 43:12.251
But there's not many of us
with this level of expertise.

43:12.284 --> 43:13.419
Of course.

43:16.121 --> 43:17.121
So,

43:19.992 --> 43:23.495
is now a good time
to talk about Dad?

43:24.997 --> 43:25.997
Sure.

43:26.498 --> 43:27.498
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:47.286 --> 43:48.454
So just so we're clear here,

43:48.487 --> 43:53.158
I'm not generally curious
about our parents.

43:53.192 --> 43:54.970
If I was, I wouldn't have chosen
to stay out of their lives

43:54.994 --> 43:56.328
for the past 20 years.

44:02.468 --> 44:03.936
But, um,

44:06.505 --> 44:11.310
do you want to
tell me how he is?

44:11.343 --> 44:13.512
Like for you?

44:17.283 --> 44:19.151
So much has happened
since you left.

44:21.854 --> 44:23.889
Dad was hospitalized
a few years ago,

44:26.258 --> 44:27.393
mental breakdown,

44:28.327 --> 44:29.495
diagnosis bipolar.

44:30.396 --> 44:32.097
And Mom,

44:33.332 --> 44:35.301
I mean, she's never
been formally diagnosed,

44:35.334 --> 44:38.437
but you know it's very
borderline personality disorder.

44:38.470 --> 44:40.539
Okay, so now these
things have names.

44:44.209 --> 44:45.878
He's like bad, Nathan.

44:48.113 --> 44:51.917
I mean, he can't
stand up on his own.

44:51.950 --> 44:53.352
He's refusing to eat.

44:55.387 --> 44:58.590
This really is it.

44:58.624 --> 45:01.393
So if there's any part of
you that wants to see him,

45:03.395 --> 45:06.899
now would be the time.

45:14.540 --> 45:16.408
I don't think I can go see him.

45:18.210 --> 45:19.545
Yeah.

45:19.578 --> 45:20.512
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

45:20.546 --> 45:21.880
No.

45:21.914 --> 45:22.915
Thanks for coming.

45:23.549 --> 45:24.583
Yeah.

45:30.489 --> 45:32.091
It's because of her.

45:34.593 --> 45:36.328
- What?
- I don't want to see her.

45:37.196 --> 45:40.165
I don't, I really
don't want to see her.

45:40.199 --> 45:41.199
Okay.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.602
Can I ask you why?

45:49.341 --> 45:50.341
Yeah.

45:52.411 --> 45:54.113
His wreckage was

45:56.315 --> 45:57.315
tangible.

45:59.952 --> 46:03.455
Hers was so insidious
and disturbing.

46:06.125 --> 46:07.526
I just can't go there.

46:09.361 --> 46:10.361
Okay.

46:12.531 --> 46:13.999
What if she wasn't there?

46:16.502 --> 46:17.970
What?

46:18.003 --> 46:19.706
What if she wasn't there?

46:19.739 --> 46:21.206
- Wow.
- Yeah.

46:22.241 --> 46:23.643
That's a good start for you.

46:25.043 --> 46:26.478
So your life is just always

46:26.512 --> 46:29.548
kind of like this
emotion, this intensity?

46:29.581 --> 46:32.151
You havin' to fix everything?

46:32.184 --> 46:33.184
Yeah.

46:34.453 --> 46:35.487
Yeah, it's all I know.

46:37.156 --> 46:40.492
But this, I mean, how am I
supposed to tell my mother

46:40.526 --> 46:42.227
that she can't be
there when her son,

46:42.261 --> 46:43.663
who she hasn't
seen for 20 years,

46:43.696 --> 46:46.398
visits her husband who is dying.

46:47.634 --> 46:48.668
I just,

46:50.102 --> 46:52.104
I don't know how to
tackle that one yet.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.574
But I've got to fix it.

46:57.109 --> 46:58.109
I said I'd fix it.

47:01.648 --> 47:03.716
Well, I kind of
fix for a living.

47:03.750 --> 47:05.417
And I can tell you this,

47:06.518 --> 47:09.555
things will keep breaking.

47:13.158 --> 47:14.727
So what are you gonna do?

47:22.669 --> 47:23.736
I'm so sorry.

47:23.770 --> 47:25.772
- It's okay.
- I really wanna do this.

47:25.805 --> 47:27.206
It's okay.

47:27.239 --> 47:28.407
Just in case something.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.042
Oh, say hi for me.

47:30.075 --> 47:31.109
- Who's that?
- Nobody.

47:31.143 --> 47:32.544
It's me, the landscaper.

47:32.578 --> 47:34.146
Oh, Jed.

47:34.179 --> 47:35.380
Jay.

47:35.414 --> 47:36.783
What are you crazy kids up to?

47:36.816 --> 47:38.651
I'm not,

47:38.685 --> 47:39.762
Ma, let me call you tomorrow.

47:39.786 --> 47:41.453
- Okay?
- Okay.

47:41.487 --> 47:44.791
And Jeff, make sure to come
to Eugene's birthday party

47:44.824 --> 47:46.258
next week.

47:46.291 --> 47:47.803
It's likely the last
one he'll ever have.

47:47.827 --> 47:49.629
- Mom.
- I would love to,

47:49.662 --> 47:52.231
but my parents are going
to be in town from Oakland.

47:52.264 --> 47:53.365
So he has plans.

47:53.398 --> 47:54.500
- Plans.
- Great.

47:54.533 --> 47:55.467
Bring them too.

47:55.501 --> 47:57.078
- The more, the merrier.
- Oh, God in heaven.

47:57.102 --> 47:58.604
No, Ma.

47:58.638 --> 48:01.106
It's a party, Abigail.

48:01.139 --> 48:04.142
Don't you want to celebrate
your father's last birthday

48:04.176 --> 48:07.412
and let him see you
finally got a date?

48:07.446 --> 48:11.316
Okay, Ma, I'm
calling you tomorrow.

48:11.350 --> 48:12.117
- Bye, love you.
- Goodbye.

48:12.150 --> 48:13.150
Bye.

48:17.222 --> 48:19.659
What are you doing?

48:19.692 --> 48:22.662
Securing the weirdest
second date ever.

48:22.695 --> 48:23.763
- Truly.
- Truly.

48:24.797 --> 48:26.265
Like being around you.

48:30.502 --> 48:32.337
This isn't too much?

48:33.873 --> 48:35.407
It's so messy.

48:36.876 --> 48:38.510
That's not how I see it.

48:56.796 --> 48:58.597
My mom gets weird at parties.

48:58.631 --> 49:01.466
Her behavior is not
a reflection on me.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.670
Today is about my dad.

49:03.703 --> 49:07.640
I can do for an hour, what I
couldn't do for a lifetime.

49:07.674 --> 49:09.241
I am not her.

49:09.274 --> 49:10.342
She is not me.

49:15.147 --> 49:16.415
Okay, party people.

49:16.883 --> 49:18.417
Let's do this.

49:21.688 --> 49:23.188
Where is the...

49:24.356 --> 49:25.190
birthday boy?

49:25.223 --> 49:26.291
Hi.

49:26.325 --> 49:27.660
Hello.

49:27.694 --> 49:28.861
- How are you?
- Good.

49:30.162 --> 49:32.699
Darrin, Dad, this is Jay.

49:32.732 --> 49:34.199
Hello, Mr. Frey.

49:34.801 --> 49:36.368
Hi.

49:36.401 --> 49:37.870
- Hi.
- Sup.

49:37.904 --> 49:40.172
All high fives
and handshakes and.

49:40.907 --> 49:44.343
This is Billy and Marge,

49:44.376 --> 49:46.244
sorry, Marge and Billy.

49:46.278 --> 49:48.547
These are Jay's parents and
they're celebrating with us

49:48.580 --> 49:49.716
because they are in town.

49:49.749 --> 49:50.759
- How are you, Mr. Frey?
- Happy birthday.

49:50.783 --> 49:52.284
Where's the dad?

49:53.619 --> 49:55.187
- Hi, Ma.
- Hi.

49:55.220 --> 49:56.254
Hello.

49:57.289 --> 49:58.658
Hello, welcome.

49:58.691 --> 49:59.892
Can I get you a drink?

49:59.926 --> 50:01.894
We have mimosas.

50:01.928 --> 50:03.462
Come on, Jed.

50:03.495 --> 50:04.764
Jay, Mom.

50:04.797 --> 50:05.765
I'm sorry.

50:05.798 --> 50:06.798
It's okay.

50:08.400 --> 50:09.400
Okay.

50:10.870 --> 50:13.405
- The father didn't come?
- Dad.

50:14.707 --> 50:16.174
So how is your day?

50:16.208 --> 50:16.809
Oh.

50:16.843 --> 50:18.276
It's been up and down.

50:18.310 --> 50:19.888
We took a nice walk in
the park, right Mr. F?

50:19.912 --> 50:20.947
Okay.

50:20.980 --> 50:22.414
Just okay?

50:22.447 --> 50:23.382
Come on, we saw a
three legged dog.

50:23.415 --> 50:24.616
We checked out the ladies.

50:24.651 --> 50:25.928
We saw the little kid
who fell on his face

50:25.952 --> 50:27.386
when he tripped
on that sprinkler.

50:27.419 --> 50:28.955
We laughed a little bit.

50:30.723 --> 50:31.658
What?

50:31.691 --> 50:33.558
- It was funny.
- Oh my God.

50:33.592 --> 50:35.327
Laughing at little
kids falling down.

50:35.360 --> 50:36.739
- Speaking of little kids.
- Hi, Mom.

50:36.763 --> 50:37.797
Hello.

50:37.830 --> 50:40.198
Oh, are you having a good day?

50:40.232 --> 50:40.967
Missed you.

50:41.000 --> 50:42.467
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:42.501 --> 50:43.803
Hiding in the back room?

50:43.836 --> 50:45.772
Your mom was having
a moment or three.

50:45.805 --> 50:46.806
Uh-huh, yeah.

50:46.839 --> 50:48.908
Along with her mimosa or three.

50:49.876 --> 50:50.876
I'm sorry.

50:52.310 --> 50:53.421
You're supposed to talk
to her about drinking

50:53.445 --> 50:54.814
- in front of the boys.
- I know.

50:54.847 --> 50:56.381
I just.

50:56.415 --> 50:57.282
It needs to happen.

50:57.315 --> 50:58.851
I will do it.

50:58.885 --> 50:59.686
Hi, Jay.

50:59.719 --> 51:00.519
Hey, Peter.

51:00.552 --> 51:01.754
Good to see ya.

51:01.788 --> 51:02.755
Hey fellas.

51:02.789 --> 51:04.356
When is cake time?

51:04.824 --> 51:09.829
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

51:10.029 --> 51:13.900
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

51:13.933 --> 51:18.905
♪ Happy birthday, dear Eugene ♪

51:19.839 --> 51:22.809
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

51:22.842 --> 51:25.712
- Happy birthday, dad.
- Blow 'em out, Mr. F.

51:31.283 --> 51:33.251
I'd say it went pretty well.

51:33.285 --> 51:35.788
I wish Nathan was here.

51:41.493 --> 51:42.795
All right.

51:42.829 --> 51:47.399
Let's get this cake served.

51:47.432 --> 51:49.635
Nice piece for you, Eugene.

51:49.669 --> 51:51.269
- I don't want it.
- Yes, you do.

51:51.303 --> 51:53.405
- You love this cake.
- No, I don't want it.

51:53.438 --> 51:55.407
- You do.
- I don't.

51:55.440 --> 51:56.575
I don't want it.

51:56.608 --> 51:57.686
- Yes you do, Eugene.
- No, I don't.

51:57.710 --> 51:58.510
Yes, you do.

51:58.543 --> 51:59.444
Come on, Eugene.

51:59.478 --> 52:00.278
God dammit.

52:00.312 --> 52:01.681
I don't, please.

52:01.714 --> 52:02.514
- Ma.
- Mommy,

52:02.547 --> 52:03.950
maybe he's not hungry.

52:03.983 --> 52:05.718
No, that is not an option.

52:05.752 --> 52:06.953
It's his birthday.

52:06.986 --> 52:08.988
He has to eat his cake.

52:09.021 --> 52:09.922
Okay, you know what, Mrs. F?

52:09.956 --> 52:10.857
Maybe you should back off.

52:10.890 --> 52:11.791
Let's just take a walk.

52:11.824 --> 52:13.760
It's his favorite cake.

52:13.793 --> 52:14.761
He loves it.

52:14.794 --> 52:18.430
We're all going to enjoy
it together, God dammit.

52:18.463 --> 52:19.364
You know what, Mrs. F?

52:19.397 --> 52:20.565
I'm just asking you to stop.

52:20.599 --> 52:23.703
Darrin, I don't recall
asking your opinion.

52:23.736 --> 52:25.638
Just know your place.

52:25.671 --> 52:27.740
- Okay, know your place.
- Oh, hell no.

52:27.774 --> 52:28.941
Darrin, I'll handle this.

52:28.975 --> 52:30.408
- Abigail?
- Yes?

52:30.442 --> 52:31.754
I think we're just
gonna grab a ride,

52:31.778 --> 52:32.678
but I'll call you.

52:32.712 --> 52:33.880
All right, I'll call you.

52:33.913 --> 52:35.848
That's just, okay.

52:35.882 --> 52:37.449
- Thank you.
- Honey, hush.

52:37.482 --> 52:38.885
Let's just get out of here.

52:38.918 --> 52:41.319
We can talk about this later.

52:42.354 --> 52:43.923
Why are you sending them away?

52:43.956 --> 52:44.991
Because, Ma.

52:45.024 --> 52:46.391
You know what, Dad?

52:46.424 --> 52:48.326
Let's get you down
to take a nap.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.461
You've had a big day.

52:49.494 --> 52:50.763
Let's get you down okay.

52:50.797 --> 52:51.731
You just broke up the party.

52:51.764 --> 52:54.000
Hey Darrin, can I
borrow you for a second?

52:54.033 --> 52:54.901
Yeah, of course.

52:54.934 --> 52:55.735
- Can you help?
- Yeah.

52:55.768 --> 52:57.402
Thanks, I got the chair.

52:57.435 --> 52:58.805
- I got ya, Mr. F.
- Hey, hey, hey.

52:58.838 --> 53:02.407
No one naps until they
eat their cake, Darrin.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.943
We're gonna go.

53:03.976 --> 53:05.011
Come on, Dad.

53:15.788 --> 53:17.990
If it were my last
birthday on Earth,

53:19.692 --> 53:20.893
I would eat this cake.

53:38.911 --> 53:39.946
Daddy.

54:36.102 --> 54:37.069
Sit down, sit down.

54:37.103 --> 54:38.204
I need to talk to you.

54:38.237 --> 54:41.207
Dad, I really don't-

54:41.240 --> 54:44.710
- You know your mom and
I had a big fight, right?

54:44.744 --> 54:46.846
She doesn't like me smoking pot.

54:46.879 --> 54:48.948
You know, it's not like
I'm hurting anybody.

54:48.981 --> 54:52.118
It's not like something I don't
have complete control over.

54:53.252 --> 54:55.154
I'm thinking of moving
back to the city.

54:55.187 --> 54:56.856
What?

54:56.889 --> 54:59.959
No, but I came out here
because your mom wanted to,

54:59.992 --> 55:03.129
I wanted to stay there because
that's where the energy is.

55:03.930 --> 55:05.765
I'm an artist, Abby.

55:05.798 --> 55:08.801
I'm a writer, I want to write
the great American novel.

55:08.834 --> 55:11.103
- Dad.
- But there's no energy here.

55:11.137 --> 55:12.537
Dad, just-

55:12.570 --> 55:14.640
- My psychiatrist says
that if he were me,

55:14.674 --> 55:16.541
he would blow his
fuckin' brains out

55:16.574 --> 55:18.144
if he had a wife
who was this frigid

55:18.177 --> 55:20.146
and a son who
wouldn't talk to him.

55:21.814 --> 55:23.683
There's no love
for me here, Abby.

55:27.053 --> 55:29.088
How could you say that to me?

55:29.121 --> 55:30.056
I'm here.

55:30.089 --> 55:31.190
I love you.

55:33.960 --> 55:35.661
Have you spoken to your brother?

55:39.832 --> 55:40.832
No.

55:45.137 --> 55:48.606
My Abby, my Abby, my Abby.

55:50.009 --> 55:51.509
You know me better than anybody.

55:51.543 --> 55:52.945
You always have.

55:52.979 --> 55:54.914
You know me better
than your mother.

55:56.148 --> 55:57.183
That's for sure.

55:58.050 --> 55:59.051
Thank you.

55:59.085 --> 56:01.087
I gotta go to the bathroom.

56:16.702 --> 56:17.770
Hey.

56:17.803 --> 56:19.205
Hey.

56:19.238 --> 56:21.040
He's asleep.

56:21.073 --> 56:21.874
He's asleep?

56:21.907 --> 56:23.109
He is, yeah.

56:25.144 --> 56:26.178
Okay.

56:28.047 --> 56:29.015
I didn't know my cake

56:29.048 --> 56:32.284
would become such a big
part of the evening.

56:35.354 --> 56:36.789
The cake was delicious, Ma.

56:36.822 --> 56:37.822
I know it was.

56:41.093 --> 56:42.228
I spoke to Nathan.

56:45.698 --> 56:46.698
You called him?

56:48.734 --> 56:49.734
I did.

56:51.971 --> 56:53.039
He wants to see Dad.

56:56.909 --> 56:57.909
Wow.

57:01.814 --> 57:05.851
Wow, wow, wow, wow,
wow, wow, wow, wow.

57:05.885 --> 57:06.885
Yeah.

57:09.255 --> 57:11.724
When, wh, when
does he want to come?

57:16.362 --> 57:17.630
He can come tomorrow.

57:17.663 --> 57:18.631
Oh God.

57:18.664 --> 57:21.967
Oh, well, huh, soon.

57:25.337 --> 57:26.337
But, uh,

57:29.675 --> 57:30.675
here's the thing.

57:31.811 --> 57:34.280
He is not ready to see you yet.

57:41.654 --> 57:45.324
Huh.

57:45.357 --> 57:46.357
Hah.

57:50.162 --> 57:54.300
And, and why would that be?

57:57.303 --> 57:58.303
I don't know.

58:01.307 --> 58:03.909
'Cause he just wants to
keep things really simple.

58:03.943 --> 58:04.943
Yeah, sure.

58:07.213 --> 58:09.215
I know this is hard for you.

58:10.316 --> 58:13.185
Hah.

58:13.219 --> 58:14.219
Yeah.

58:15.254 --> 58:17.323
This is something
that you would do for Dad.

58:17.356 --> 58:18.356
Yeah.

58:22.061 --> 58:23.262
Are you good?

58:23.295 --> 58:25.698
Oh, good, I'm feeling good.

58:25.731 --> 58:26.832
Fine, fine.

58:29.301 --> 58:30.302
And you're

58:32.805 --> 58:35.107
gonna let him see-

58:35.141 --> 58:36.175
- Oh yeah.

58:36.208 --> 58:39.979
I wouldn't stand in his way.

58:42.081 --> 58:43.081
Sure.

59:02.401 --> 59:03.702
Hey Abby, Hannah White.

59:03.736 --> 59:06.038
Listen, I got your message.

59:06.071 --> 59:08.741
You don't really sound like
you're stable right now.

59:08.774 --> 59:10.709
Hey Abby, it's Jay.

59:10.743 --> 59:14.180
So, I know you're in
a really rough place.

59:14.213 --> 59:15.381
Time off.

59:15.414 --> 59:17.225
I think you should take that
sabbatical we talked about.

59:17.249 --> 59:20.319
After the
whole party cake thing,

59:20.352 --> 59:21.787
you just gotta-

59:21.820 --> 59:22.931
- Let me know
when you're ready to talk

59:22.955 --> 59:24.456
from a more centered
perspective.

59:24.490 --> 59:25.891
Hit pause for a minute.

59:25.925 --> 59:27.102
The garden's at a
good stopping place,

59:27.126 --> 59:29.728
so let's touch base
in a bit, okay?

59:29.762 --> 59:31.263
- Take care of yourself.
- Take care.

59:31.297 --> 59:33.232
Abbs, I gotta go.

59:33.265 --> 59:34.133
Get out of there!

59:34.166 --> 59:37.970
You have to get
yourself out of there!

59:38.003 --> 59:38.904
- Nathan.
- Do what you need to,

59:38.938 --> 59:40.139
do what you need to.

59:40.172 --> 59:42.775
- I have to go.
- Nathan.

59:42.808 --> 59:43.808
You ready?

59:45.211 --> 59:46.211
Mm-hm.

1:00:00.492 --> 1:00:02.461
All right, Mr. F?

1:00:02.494 --> 1:00:03.362
It's the moment you've
been waiting for.

1:00:03.395 --> 1:00:04.897
Thanks for the shower.

1:00:04.930 --> 1:00:06.098
I got you.

1:00:06.131 --> 1:00:07.509
Your little man's all grown
up and he comin' to see you.

1:00:07.533 --> 1:00:08.367
Nathan.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:10.336
Yeah, we got you
looking pretty fly

1:00:10.369 --> 1:00:12.071
if I do say so myself.

1:00:12.104 --> 1:00:13.339
Give me some.

1:00:13.372 --> 1:00:14.340
There you go.

1:00:14.373 --> 1:00:15.441
That was good enough.

1:00:17.076 --> 1:00:18.377
Don't you look handsome?

1:00:18.410 --> 1:00:19.410
You're welcome.

1:00:20.412 --> 1:00:21.914
- Hi.
- Hey, Dad.

1:00:23.983 --> 1:00:24.917
How are you feeling?

1:00:24.950 --> 1:00:26.285
Nervous.

1:00:26.318 --> 1:00:27.319
Good though.

1:00:28.354 --> 1:00:30.489
- Nerve is good.
- You ready?

1:00:36.495 --> 1:00:37.495
Oh.

1:00:38.364 --> 1:00:39.465
Hello, Nathan.

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:42.000
Hello.

1:01:01.954 --> 1:01:04.089
I never thought I'd live to see

1:01:05.090 --> 1:01:06.959
the two of you together again.

1:01:09.495 --> 1:01:11.597
I'll leave you two to catch up.

1:01:11.631 --> 1:01:12.431
No.

1:01:12.464 --> 1:01:14.300
- Stay.
- Stay.

1:01:14.333 --> 1:01:15.801
- Stay.
- Okay.

1:01:16.602 --> 1:01:18.003
So Nate,

1:01:19.972 --> 1:01:20.972
how is,

1:01:23.409 --> 1:01:24.943
how are you?

1:01:24.977 --> 1:01:25.978
And how is,

1:01:26.979 --> 1:01:29.882
it's, I know, don't tell me.

1:01:31.517 --> 1:01:32.584
- Karen.
- Karen.

1:01:32.618 --> 1:01:33.618
How's Karen?

1:01:34.420 --> 1:01:36.055
Good.

1:01:36.088 --> 1:01:37.556
Everything is really good.

1:01:38.257 --> 1:01:39.391
Good.

1:01:39.425 --> 1:01:42.394
I came down to give a lecture
on the Meiji Restoration

1:01:42.428 --> 1:01:44.496
at the College of
Art and Design.

1:01:44.530 --> 1:01:46.031
- Oh.
- He was wonderful.

1:01:48.967 --> 1:01:52.071
We actually just got
back from a road trip

1:01:52.104 --> 1:01:54.406
to all the national
parks of Utah.

1:01:55.274 --> 1:01:56.875
Utah?

1:01:56.909 --> 1:01:58.110
Yeah.

1:01:58.143 --> 1:02:00.579
Bryce, Zion, Arches.

1:02:02.014 --> 1:02:07.953
I had great memories from
those trips you took us on,

1:02:10.489 --> 1:02:11.489
like Yosemite.

1:02:13.025 --> 1:02:15.394
You got me the T-shirt
with the space,

1:02:15.427 --> 1:02:18.897
it looked like yo-semite.

1:02:26.105 --> 1:02:27.406
- Dad?
- Yeah?

1:02:29.608 --> 1:02:31.910
Everything good about
me is because of you.

1:02:34.113 --> 1:02:35.481
You encouraged me to love art

1:02:35.514 --> 1:02:38.016
and to make a living
surrounded by art.

1:02:38.050 --> 1:02:39.050
Thank you.

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:42.220
Nate.

1:02:48.026 --> 1:02:51.897
You got to live a
life I never could.

1:02:56.034 --> 1:02:57.436
I,

1:02:57.469 --> 1:03:01.073
I tried to give you
the best life I could.

1:03:04.644 --> 1:03:05.644
I tried.

1:03:06.478 --> 1:03:07.513
You tried.

1:03:07.546 --> 1:03:08.546
Yes.

1:03:20.125 --> 1:03:22.094
- Dad.
- What?

1:03:22.494 --> 1:03:24.530
What else do you
want to say to Nathan?

1:03:26.565 --> 1:03:28.934
When do I get to see him again?

1:03:33.105 --> 1:03:35.574
I don't know, Dad.

1:03:35.607 --> 1:03:36.643
What?

1:03:39.679 --> 1:03:42.581
I'd love a
photo of the three of us.

1:03:42.614 --> 1:03:44.516
Darrin, can you help
us for a second?

1:03:46.618 --> 1:03:47.687
Wouldn't that be great?

1:04:21.587 --> 1:04:23.690
How long do you think
he's going to sleep for?

1:04:25.123 --> 1:04:26.458
That was a lot for him.

1:04:26.492 --> 1:04:27.593
I know.

1:04:27.626 --> 1:04:29.161
He'll be out for a while.

1:04:34.099 --> 1:04:35.501
He's sleeping more and more.

1:04:38.705 --> 1:04:40.372
Hey.

1:04:40.405 --> 1:04:42.285
You know, I'm gonna go
ahead and sit with Mr. F.

1:04:46.679 --> 1:04:47.679
Hey.

1:04:51.083 --> 1:04:51.684
How'd it go?

1:04:51.718 --> 1:04:52.752
It went well.

1:04:54.453 --> 1:04:55.487
Took a picture.

1:04:55.521 --> 1:04:56.521
Do you want to see?

1:04:58.123 --> 1:04:59.123
Sure.

1:05:04.697 --> 1:05:05.732
There you go.

1:05:06.799 --> 1:05:09.134
Wow, ooh.

1:05:09.167 --> 1:05:10.167
Whew.

1:05:11.570 --> 1:05:14.674
That is totally weird.

1:05:14.707 --> 1:05:16.174
What's weird?

1:05:16.208 --> 1:05:19.144
Your brother, he's all bloated.

1:05:19.177 --> 1:05:20.813
Why did he get so bloated?

1:05:20.847 --> 1:05:22.247
What?

1:05:22.281 --> 1:05:24.684
Oh God, and his eyes are puffy.

1:05:27.286 --> 1:05:29.689
That's not what I see in it, Ma.

1:05:29.722 --> 1:05:32.558
Well, no, but I see him here,

1:05:33.893 --> 1:05:36.763
he looks like somebody
who's on that medication

1:05:36.796 --> 1:05:41.133
for the inflamed kishkas,
what is that thing called?

1:05:41.166 --> 1:05:42.669
- The kishkas.
- Colitis.

1:05:42.702 --> 1:05:44.136
Yeah, colitis is what,

1:05:44.169 --> 1:05:47.640
exactly, he looks like
someone with colitis.

1:05:47.674 --> 1:05:49.274
He probably has colitis.

1:05:49.308 --> 1:05:51.610
Okay, well that
is our photo and,

1:05:53.713 --> 1:05:55.414
yeah it went well.

1:05:55.447 --> 1:05:56.783
Good.

1:05:56.816 --> 1:05:57.717
Glad to hear it.

1:05:57.750 --> 1:05:59.652
What have you been up to?

1:05:59.686 --> 1:06:01.119
Oh, well,

1:06:01.921 --> 1:06:05.490
I have been on a toilet
seat at a coffee shop.

1:06:05.524 --> 1:06:06.859
Fun.

1:06:07.794 --> 1:06:08.828
Okay.

1:06:09.696 --> 1:06:10.730
Okay.

1:06:11.898 --> 1:06:14.634
Did he mention me?

1:06:17.469 --> 1:06:18.805
It didn't really come up.

1:06:20.873 --> 1:06:21.873
Ah.

1:06:23.175 --> 1:06:24.677
Let me see that picture again.

1:06:25.544 --> 1:06:26.612
Let me see it.

1:06:28.447 --> 1:06:29.447
Okay.

1:06:37.389 --> 1:06:38.658
Hmm.

1:06:38.691 --> 1:06:39.892
Well, you look beautiful,

1:06:39.926 --> 1:06:45.230
but he does not look
like your brother.

1:06:45.263 --> 1:06:46.264
I mean, really.

1:06:47.199 --> 1:06:50.602
It's like a interloper.

1:06:51.436 --> 1:06:52.571
Okay.

1:06:52.604 --> 1:06:53.604
Okay.

1:07:02.547 --> 1:07:03.883
Abbs?

1:07:03.916 --> 1:07:05.183
Yeah, Dad?

1:07:11.824 --> 1:07:16.829
Sometimes when I close
my eyes, I see things.

1:07:19.799 --> 1:07:20.867
What do you see?

1:07:20.900 --> 1:07:22.434
I see your boys.

1:07:25.270 --> 1:07:26.270
I see.

1:07:28.340 --> 1:07:31.443
Davis running the
bases in softball.

1:07:32.645 --> 1:07:35.414
I never got to see
him play one game.

1:07:35.447 --> 1:07:36.615
That's okay.

1:07:37.616 --> 1:07:39.986
I see him running the bases

1:07:40.019 --> 1:07:44.724
and Finn is running
right behind him.

1:07:48.427 --> 1:07:49.662
Sometimes I see

1:07:55.034 --> 1:07:56.034
your mother.

1:07:57.036 --> 1:07:58.838
Yeah?

1:07:58.871 --> 1:08:04.409
She looks the way she
did when we first met.

1:08:05.945 --> 1:08:06.979
How's that?

1:08:07.013 --> 1:08:08.648
When she was 16.

1:08:10.515 --> 1:08:12.617
She looks beautiful,
she's so beautiful.

1:08:17.824 --> 1:08:19.357
I worry about her.

1:08:21.994 --> 1:08:22.994
Why is that?

1:08:25.732 --> 1:08:27.800
That she won't be okay, that

1:08:32.839 --> 1:08:33.940
she'll miss me.

1:08:42.481 --> 1:08:45.952
I never meant that I could
do anything without her.

1:08:50.089 --> 1:08:52.925
And now I'm gonna
die without her.

1:08:56.528 --> 1:08:58.664
All I want is to be with her

1:09:01.801 --> 1:09:02.801
forever.

1:09:05.504 --> 1:09:06.939
Do you ever tell her that?

1:09:08.641 --> 1:09:10.676
Oh, I couldn't tell her that.

1:09:14.981 --> 1:09:16.281
You just did.

1:09:21.854 --> 1:09:23.022
Is that you?

1:09:27.459 --> 1:09:28.795
You're my world.

1:09:32.932 --> 1:09:33.932
You know?

1:09:35.968 --> 1:09:37.003
Do you know?

1:09:57.156 --> 1:09:58.156
Hey.

1:09:59.959 --> 1:10:01.459
How's he doing today?

1:10:04.429 --> 1:10:05.429
Has he eaten?

1:10:09.534 --> 1:10:11.804
Ice chips.

1:10:16.175 --> 1:10:17.877
He's startin' his transition

1:10:19.779 --> 1:10:21.848
to a place where you
won't need any food,

1:10:23.916 --> 1:10:25.383
he won't feel any pain.

1:10:27.653 --> 1:10:29.021
It's a place of the spirit.

1:10:31.190 --> 1:10:32.390
Come here.

1:10:36.829 --> 1:10:38.496
You've been so good to him.

1:10:38.530 --> 1:10:39.832
No, it's okay.

1:10:39.866 --> 1:10:40.866
Thank you.

1:10:43.535 --> 1:10:45.004
You're such a good daughter.

1:10:47.505 --> 1:10:48.975
He's so loved.

1:10:50.676 --> 1:10:51.676
It's okay.

1:11:28.114 --> 1:11:30.182
To begin with, no.

1:11:30.216 --> 1:11:32.018
Let me call
attention to the fact

1:11:32.051 --> 1:11:36.055
that the ones hunting us
are young male adults.

1:11:40.693 --> 1:11:42.728
- I'm thirsty.
- Thirsty?

1:11:46.132 --> 1:11:46.899
Of his culture.

1:11:46.933 --> 1:11:48.200
You caught me.

1:11:50.136 --> 1:11:50.836
Do you get it?

1:11:50.870 --> 1:11:52.104
No.

1:12:21.734 --> 1:12:22.534
How's that?

1:12:22.567 --> 1:12:23.235
Little more.

1:12:23.269 --> 1:12:24.837
- Okay.
- Little more.

1:12:24.870 --> 1:12:26.072
Okay.

1:12:26.105 --> 1:12:27.105
Okay.

1:12:29.208 --> 1:12:30.876
Abbs.

1:12:30.910 --> 1:12:32.178
Abbs.

1:12:38.985 --> 1:12:41.988
Athan.

1:12:44.056 --> 1:12:45.056
Nathan?

1:12:49.996 --> 1:12:50.996
No.

1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:55.735
- No?
- No.

1:13:04.910 --> 1:13:06.045
Hi, this is Nathan,

1:13:06.078 --> 1:13:08.180
leave a message after the beep.

1:13:08.214 --> 1:13:09.214
Wait for the beep.

1:13:10.049 --> 1:13:11.150
Wait for the beep.

1:13:12.752 --> 1:13:15.187
Hold on, here it comes.

1:13:16.588 --> 1:13:17.790
Beep, that wasn't it.

1:13:40.713 --> 1:13:42.580
I can go get it.

1:13:42.614 --> 1:13:44.083
I'll get it.

1:13:44.116 --> 1:13:47.119
No, honey, you shouldn't
be getting his morphine.

1:13:47.153 --> 1:13:48.988
- I'll be right back, Ma.
- That's his job.

1:13:50.322 --> 1:13:52.091
Ma, I'd like Darrin to be here

1:13:52.124 --> 1:13:54.760
in case anything happens, okay?

1:13:54.794 --> 1:13:55.795
Okay.

1:13:55.828 --> 1:13:56.929
Can I have a minute?

1:14:16.649 --> 1:14:17.649
Hey, Dad.

1:14:20.686 --> 1:14:21.854
I'm gonna go.

1:14:24.290 --> 1:14:26.158
I'm gonna be right back.

1:14:28.661 --> 1:14:30.229
I know how much pain you're in.

1:14:33.666 --> 1:14:36.268
If you wanna go while I'm gone,

1:14:39.338 --> 1:14:40.339
that's okay.

1:14:51.717 --> 1:14:52.718
That's okay.

1:14:55.287 --> 1:14:56.956
I promise it's okay.

1:15:06.999 --> 1:15:08.667
I love you the most.

1:15:17.476 --> 1:15:19.211
I know you know that.

1:15:34.860 --> 1:15:36.295
Hey.

1:15:36.328 --> 1:15:38.097
It's good you called.

1:15:39.131 --> 1:15:40.432
I'm happy to help.

1:15:46.805 --> 1:15:47.973
Hey, what's going on?

1:15:48.007 --> 1:15:49.117
Abigail, he isn't breathing.

1:15:49.141 --> 1:15:50.776
Abigail, he
was breathing a minute ago.

1:15:50.809 --> 1:15:52.111
Should we call 911?

1:15:52.144 --> 1:15:53.245
No.

1:15:53.279 --> 1:15:54.389
No, that's not how this works.

1:15:54.413 --> 1:15:56.148
We don't call 911.

1:15:56.182 --> 1:15:57.716
That's not how this works.

1:15:58.817 --> 1:16:00.786
We do nothing.

1:16:03.789 --> 1:16:04.990
Ma, can you hear me?

1:16:06.025 --> 1:16:07.326
Okay.

1:16:07.359 --> 1:16:09.261
Have you recited the Shema?

1:16:09.295 --> 1:16:10.362
No.

1:16:11.363 --> 1:16:12.865
Repeat three times,

1:16:14.099 --> 1:16:17.269
Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai
Eloheinu Adonai Echad.

1:16:17.303 --> 1:16:22.107
Sh'ma Yisrael
Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad.

1:16:22.141 --> 1:16:26.412
Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai
Eloheinu Adonai Echad.

1:16:26.445 --> 1:16:30.115
Sh'ma Yisrael Adonai
Eloheinu Adonai Echad.

1:16:30.149 --> 1:16:33.152
Baruch shem kevod
malchuto le'olam va'ed.

1:16:33.185 --> 1:16:37.856
Baruch shem
kevod malchuto le'olam va'ed.

1:16:37.890 --> 1:16:40.759
Baruch dayan ha-emet.

1:16:40.793 --> 1:16:43.996
Baruch dayan ha-emet.

1:16:44.029 --> 1:16:46.398
All right, I'll see you soon.

1:16:49.001 --> 1:16:50.536
Turn around.

1:17:27.940 --> 1:17:30.109
What do you mean
they have to take him away?

1:17:30.142 --> 1:17:31.377
Can't he sleep here?

1:17:32.578 --> 1:17:34.513
Ma, they have to take him.

1:18:03.075 --> 1:18:05.411
Our wedding color was green.

1:19:13.512 --> 1:19:15.547
Abby, what was that?

1:19:15.581 --> 1:19:17.049
The power, Ma.

1:19:18.317 --> 1:19:19.317
For the hairdryer.

1:19:20.452 --> 1:19:21.487
I don't think so.

1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:23.288
It's never happened before.

1:19:24.189 --> 1:19:25.290
I think it was him.

1:19:27.259 --> 1:19:28.594
Ma, it's not him.

1:19:28.627 --> 1:19:31.463
That's not how this works, okay?

1:19:31.497 --> 1:19:33.465
What else could it have been?

1:19:35.100 --> 1:19:36.468
Is Nathan coming today?

1:19:36.502 --> 1:19:37.536
Ma,

1:19:39.571 --> 1:19:42.408
I'm gonna the fix fucking power
for your fucking hairdryer,

1:19:42.441 --> 1:19:43.375
okay?

1:19:43.409 --> 1:19:45.010
No Nathan.

1:19:45.043 --> 1:19:46.512
Abigail, I was just asking.

1:19:46.545 --> 1:19:48.013
And watch your mouth.

1:19:48.748 --> 1:19:50.482
I'm sorry. I just,

1:19:52.418 --> 1:19:53.552
I haven't heard from him

1:19:53.585 --> 1:19:56.221
and I'm dealing with a lot
of things and I just don't,

1:19:57.523 --> 1:19:58.523
sorry.

1:20:01.994 --> 1:20:03.462
It's okay, Eugene.

1:20:03.495 --> 1:20:05.364
Oh my God.

1:20:12.538 --> 1:20:14.606
Is that what
you're going to wear?

1:20:17.075 --> 1:20:18.075
What?

1:20:19.077 --> 1:20:20.412
Do you want to borrow something?

1:20:20.446 --> 1:20:23.615
Or are you good like this?

1:20:24.616 --> 1:20:26.051
Yes.

1:20:26.084 --> 1:20:28.020
Do you want me to help
you blow dry your hair?

1:20:28.053 --> 1:20:29.521
- No.
- Okay, just asking.

1:20:30.657 --> 1:20:31.691
Thank you.

1:20:41.801 --> 1:20:44.203
You want me to look nice.

1:21:04.623 --> 1:21:06.158
It's time for Keriah.

1:21:07.292 --> 1:21:09.495
We are going to
tear a cloth ribbon.

1:21:09.528 --> 1:21:11.698
Did you want to tear
your ribbon instead?

1:21:12.632 --> 1:21:13.565
No.

1:21:13.599 --> 1:21:14.600
Okay.

1:21:14.634 --> 1:21:15.702
Okay.

1:21:15.735 --> 1:21:18.036
I would like to tear a ribbon.

1:21:18.070 --> 1:21:19.070
Of course.

1:21:20.707 --> 1:21:22.508
It goes over here.

1:21:22.541 --> 1:21:23.676
Not over the heart?

1:21:24.644 --> 1:21:26.478
Only for the child.

1:21:26.512 --> 1:21:28.748
Spouses tear over
the right side.

1:21:28.781 --> 1:21:31.483
Well, I'm in as
much grief as she is.

1:23:20.592 --> 1:23:24.162
Eugene said when he saw this
dress, "That is so depressing.

1:23:24.196 --> 1:23:27.466
It looks like something you're
gonna wear to my service."

1:23:27.499 --> 1:23:28.701
And here I am.

1:23:28.735 --> 1:23:31.671
Hyman, thank you for coming.

1:23:33.706 --> 1:23:36.743
- Oh dear.
- Does Nathan know?

1:23:36.776 --> 1:23:37.644
Oh, I think so.

1:23:37.677 --> 1:23:39.244
But he did not come.

1:23:39.946 --> 1:23:41.546
That's horrible.

1:23:53.492 --> 1:23:54.393
You're really committing

1:23:54.426 --> 1:23:55.527
to those chin pubes, huh?

1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:57.362
I am all testosterone.

1:23:57.396 --> 1:23:58.396
Disgusting.

1:23:59.666 --> 1:24:00.867
Talking 'bout you?

1:24:00.900 --> 1:24:01.834
I agree.

1:24:01.868 --> 1:24:03.602
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mom.

1:24:04.904 --> 1:24:05.904
Oh.

1:24:06.706 --> 1:24:09.541
You look so pretty.

1:24:09.574 --> 1:24:10.710
- Thank you.
- You think so?

1:24:10.743 --> 1:24:12.745
Nate.

1:24:12.779 --> 1:24:14.613
You want more eye shadow?

1:24:14.647 --> 1:24:15.882
You think I need it?

1:24:15.915 --> 1:24:16.749
No.

1:24:16.783 --> 1:24:17.582
I think you look perfect.

1:24:17.616 --> 1:24:19.351
- Thanks, Ma.
- Oh, there you are.

1:24:19.384 --> 1:24:20.585
Barb, I was looking for you.

1:24:20.619 --> 1:24:21.821
Hi, guys.

1:24:21.854 --> 1:24:23.588
- Good morning.
- What's going on?

1:24:23.622 --> 1:24:24.523
This isn't a party.

1:24:24.556 --> 1:24:27.526
- Ah!
- Oh, Eug!

1:24:27.559 --> 1:24:29.004
Don't say anything,
I'll take the blame.

1:24:29.028 --> 1:24:29.829
Oh, come on.

1:24:29.862 --> 1:24:31.764
That was so violent.

1:24:31.798 --> 1:24:32.899
Get out of here.

1:24:32.932 --> 1:24:34.299
- Dad!
- On the double.

1:24:38.303 --> 1:24:41.974
And how about Suzy Lifla?

1:24:42.008 --> 1:24:45.577
Could you believe the
weight she put on?

1:24:45.610 --> 1:24:47.612
She's become a beluga,

1:24:47.647 --> 1:24:50.817
and she doesn't even
dress to help herself.

1:24:51.818 --> 1:24:53.920
And Albert Gold

1:24:54.821 --> 1:24:57.690
with the goiter on his neck.

1:24:57.724 --> 1:24:58.825
- Oh.
- Ma.

1:24:58.858 --> 1:24:59.959
- What?
- Could you stop?

1:25:01.894 --> 1:25:02.795
We just buried Dad.

1:25:02.829 --> 1:25:04.931
And you're gossiping
about all the people

1:25:04.964 --> 1:25:07.265
who came here to support you.

1:25:07.299 --> 1:25:11.336
How dare you speak to a
mourner like that, Abigail.

1:25:11.369 --> 1:25:12.705
I'm mourning too.

1:25:13.906 --> 1:25:16.743
Yes, but you are not his wife.

1:25:16.776 --> 1:25:17.810
There's a difference.

1:25:17.844 --> 1:25:19.779
You hardly acted like one.

1:25:20.947 --> 1:25:21.947
What?

1:25:23.082 --> 1:25:24.784
I hardly acted like a wife?

1:25:24.817 --> 1:25:26.919
You don't know the
half of what went on.

1:25:28.453 --> 1:25:31.490
Stay out of other people's
business, Abigail.

1:25:31.523 --> 1:25:34.359
You are constantly dragging
me into your business.

1:25:34.392 --> 1:25:36.796
And I am happy to fix
everything that you break.

1:25:36.829 --> 1:25:39.297
I have no time for myself ever

1:25:39.331 --> 1:25:40.967
to do anything.

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.803
Oh, but you had time
to ruin your marriage.

1:25:46.773 --> 1:25:48.607
Look at you, Abigail.

1:25:48.641 --> 1:25:50.308
You are a wreck.

1:25:52.011 --> 1:25:53.011
Yeah, Ma.

1:25:54.747 --> 1:25:57.049
How else do you expect me to be?

1:25:57.083 --> 1:25:58.083
Hmm?

1:25:59.351 --> 1:26:00.896
How do you expect me
to take care of myself

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:04.056
when you never give
me any room to do it?

1:26:04.090 --> 1:26:04.957
Oh, room?

1:26:04.991 --> 1:26:06.926
You want room?

1:26:06.959 --> 1:26:10.595
Oh, well go learn
from your brother.

1:27:13.993 --> 1:27:18.931
Nathan.

1:27:19.497 --> 1:27:20.900
What?

1:27:20.933 --> 1:27:22.101
She's mad at me.

1:27:22.134 --> 1:27:23.602
Abby, go away.

1:27:24.971 --> 1:27:25.971
Nathan.

1:27:26.939 --> 1:27:27.807
Please.

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:30.542
I made her mad and
she won't feed me.

1:27:31.576 --> 1:27:32.576
Please.

1:27:34.113 --> 1:27:37.049
I'm hungry and my hair's a mess.

1:27:37.083 --> 1:27:38.416
I need your help.

1:27:38.450 --> 1:27:39.752
Why can't Dad help you?

1:27:41.888 --> 1:27:43.421
I don't know where he is.

1:27:46.092 --> 1:27:47.092
Come here.

1:28:05.244 --> 1:28:07.713
Nathan.

1:28:15.154 --> 1:28:16.154
Abby.

1:28:17.622 --> 1:28:19.524
What are you doing here?

1:28:21.127 --> 1:28:23.062
I had to Bury our father today.

1:28:24.163 --> 1:28:25.163
I know.

1:28:26.799 --> 1:28:28.043
I shouldn't have
had to do that alone.

1:28:28.067 --> 1:28:29.735
Abby, I couldn't do it.

1:28:29.769 --> 1:28:31.179
I shouldn't have had to
deal with all of the things

1:28:31.203 --> 1:28:32.570
that I've had to
deal with alone.

1:28:32.604 --> 1:28:34.740
Yeah, but the
question is not why.

1:28:34.774 --> 1:28:36.151
I didn't stick around
to deal with that shit.

1:28:36.175 --> 1:28:38.744
- Why did you?
- Because I had to.

1:28:38.778 --> 1:28:40.179
Somebody had to, Nathan.

1:28:40.212 --> 1:28:42.148
You know that
somebody had to stay.

1:28:42.181 --> 1:28:43.581
- Shhh.
- And I,

1:28:45.184 --> 1:28:47.987
I have slept with all
the responsibility.

1:28:48.020 --> 1:28:49.264
I had to make all
the big decisions,

1:28:49.288 --> 1:28:52.624
I had to fix, solve, mend every
fucking thing that they did.

1:28:52.658 --> 1:28:53.993
- I needed you.
- Going to some

1:28:54.026 --> 1:28:56.729
ancient ritual with a bunch
of bullshit in Aramaic

1:28:56.762 --> 1:28:58.040
- does not matter.
- That's not it.

1:28:58.064 --> 1:28:59.641
- That's not it.
- Dad wasn't even religious.

1:28:59.665 --> 1:29:00.967
You lost the plot.

1:29:02.835 --> 1:29:03.936
You're a martyr.

1:29:05.237 --> 1:29:06.973
You're a fucking punching bag.

1:29:07.006 --> 1:29:07.907
That's what you fucking are.

1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:08.975
You're a fucking doormat.

1:29:10.176 --> 1:29:11.253
And you want me to
be that too, huh?

1:29:11.277 --> 1:29:12.812
I freed myself.

1:29:13.746 --> 1:29:15.147
Oh.

1:29:15.181 --> 1:29:18.483
Oh, you know what?

1:29:20.052 --> 1:29:21.586
I know what you carry.

1:29:22.888 --> 1:29:23.888
What I carry?

1:29:24.957 --> 1:29:26.225
You're as sick as I am.

1:29:27.693 --> 1:29:29.829
You're as sick as they made us.

1:29:31.130 --> 1:29:32.597
I see it all over you.

1:29:34.166 --> 1:29:35.234
I just-

1:29:35.267 --> 1:29:36.267
- Hey.

1:30:04.196 --> 1:30:05.631
I need those days, Abigail.

1:30:05.664 --> 1:30:07.967
Yeah, but that was
gonna be my weekend.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.102
I know, but we pride
ourselves on being flexible

1:30:10.136 --> 1:30:12.138
with our schedule, and
I'm asking this year.

1:30:13.339 --> 1:30:14.874
I'll think about it.

1:30:14.907 --> 1:30:15.775
What's to think about?

1:30:15.808 --> 1:30:16.709
It's no big deal.

1:30:16.742 --> 1:30:17.309
I'm asking for your help here.

1:30:17.343 --> 1:30:18.944
Peter, I have plans.

1:30:19.879 --> 1:30:22.214
I'm not gonna change my plans.

1:30:22.248 --> 1:30:22.982
Hey guys, come on.

1:30:23.015 --> 1:30:24.917
- Mom.
- Show her the flowers.

1:30:24.950 --> 1:30:26.152
We got flowers.

1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:30.089
Oh, you did such a good job.

1:30:30.122 --> 1:30:31.757
Thank you.

1:30:31.791 --> 1:30:32.758
My little garden gnomes.

1:30:32.792 --> 1:30:34.060
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Dad.

1:30:34.093 --> 1:30:35.593
Hey guys, let's wash your hands,

1:30:35.627 --> 1:30:37.163
because I see the food's ready.

1:30:37.196 --> 1:30:43.335
And if you guys would like
any help in washing up,

1:30:44.136 --> 1:30:45.871
I'm here.

1:30:45.905 --> 1:30:46.972
- Ma.
- Yeah.

1:30:47.006 --> 1:30:48.674
I can't with you.

1:30:52.044 --> 1:30:52.978
- Shut it.
- Listen.

1:30:53.012 --> 1:30:54.847
I know.

1:30:54.880 --> 1:30:55.781
I can't with her.

1:30:55.815 --> 1:30:57.249
She's just...

1:30:59.185 --> 1:31:00.886
- Oh wow.
- What?

1:31:00.920 --> 1:31:02.721
Is your mom texting
you from the bathroom?

1:31:06.192 --> 1:31:07.359
It's Nathan.

1:31:10.329 --> 1:31:12.164
He sent me an invitation.

1:31:16.235 --> 1:31:19.205
Some very creative combing.

1:31:20.072 --> 1:31:21.072
Whoa.

1:31:21.774 --> 1:31:23.142
Finn, ew!

1:31:23.175 --> 1:31:24.944
You are disgusting.

1:31:24.977 --> 1:31:25.778
God.

1:31:25.811 --> 1:31:27.012
Oh my God.

1:31:28.314 --> 1:31:31.817
Did I ever tell you
what Zaide likes to say?

1:31:31.851 --> 1:31:33.752
Don't say anything,
I'll take the blame.

1:31:33.786 --> 1:31:35.020
He used to think

1:31:35.054 --> 1:31:37.423
it was the most hilarious thing.

1:31:37.456 --> 1:31:39.024
He never told you that?

1:31:39.058 --> 1:31:40.192
- No.
- I don't think so.

1:31:40.226 --> 1:31:41.727
You're missing out.

1:31:41.760 --> 1:31:42.760
It was a good one.

1:31:43.729 --> 1:31:45.798
Come on, let's go.

1:31:47.199 --> 1:31:48.267
Don't want to be late.

1:31:59.778 --> 1:32:01.113
Who are those people?

1:32:01.147 --> 1:32:02.047
That's my brother, Nathan.

1:32:02.081 --> 1:32:04.383
Remember I showed you his photo?

1:32:04.416 --> 1:32:06.252
His wife, Karen, son Dylan,

1:32:06.285 --> 1:32:09.088
and his daughter, Amelia,
whose party it is,

1:32:09.121 --> 1:32:11.290
and they are coming over.

1:32:14.326 --> 1:32:15.327
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:32:18.397 --> 1:32:19.397
This is Dylan.

1:32:20.366 --> 1:32:22.201
Dylan, this is my sister.

1:32:22.234 --> 1:32:24.170
Hi Dylan, it's nice to meet you.

1:32:25.237 --> 1:32:27.439
These are my sons,
Finn and Davis.

1:32:28.807 --> 1:32:29.942
Say hi, boys.

1:32:29.975 --> 1:32:31.377
- Handshakes.
- Hi.

1:32:31.410 --> 1:32:32.410
It's okay.

1:32:33.312 --> 1:32:35.047
Hi.

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:36.215
I'm Nathan.

1:32:36.248 --> 1:32:37.283
- Hi.
- Hello.

1:32:38.350 --> 1:32:40.019
- Hi, Abigail.
- Hi, Karen.

1:32:40.052 --> 1:32:41.220
Karen, Amelia.

1:32:41.253 --> 1:32:42.988
Amelia, congratulations.

1:32:44.290 --> 1:32:45.291
Come on, boys.

1:32:45.324 --> 1:32:46.458
Let me show you around.

1:32:48.394 --> 1:32:49.728
- Come on in.
- Go ahead.

1:32:49.762 --> 1:32:50.762
It's okay.

1:32:56.468 --> 1:32:57.469
Nice party.

1:32:57.503 --> 1:32:58.503
Yeah.

1:33:19.124 --> 1:33:20.492
What, is this awkward?

1:33:20.526 --> 1:33:22.428
Nathan.

1:33:22.461 --> 1:33:23.829
No, it's awkward.

1:33:25.397 --> 1:33:27.199
You'll get there.
