<i>There were times
when I would look up to God,</i>

00:48.636 --> 00:51.404
<i>and I'd go, "Why is this
happening to me?"</i>

00:57.745 --> 00:59.644
<i>And then these dreams.</i>

00:59.646 --> 01:02.247
<i>I would have these dreams

<i>He just wants your soul."</i>

01:25.239 --> 01:27.105

01:27.107 --> 01:31.678
<i>There's been several times
the devil has tried to get me.</i>

01:31.680 --> 01:34.213

<i>She was my best friend.</i>

07:11.425 --> 07:13.959
When she was a girl,
what was Whitney like?

07:13.961 --> 07:16.094
She was beautiful.

07:16.096 --> 07:18.331
She was a good baby.

07:21.467 --> 07:22.935
Mm-hm.

07:22.937 --> 07:25.805
Everybody loved her.

07:25.807 --> 07:27.673
Except those
who were jealous of her.

07:27.675 --> 07:30.442
There were girls
who liked to run her home.

07:30.444 --> 07:33.014
But I was always
waiting outside for them.

07:34.582 --> 07:36.550
I'm a fighter, okay.

07:37.818 --> 07:39.852
All right, so
you bother my kids,

07:39.854 --> 07:41.987

07:41.989 --> 07:43.922
<i>The neighborhood we lived in</i>

07:43.924 --> 07:46.525
<i>was a lot of dark-skinned,
colored people,</i>

07:46.527 --> 07:48.728
<i>and Whitney used to get
picked on all the time</i>

07:48.730 --> 07:50.997
<i>for being light-skinned...
A little white girl.</i>

07:50.999 --> 07:53.032
<i>...'cause my mother
would dress her nice.</i>

07:53.034 --> 07:56.069
<i>She was a quiet, sweet kid.</i>

07:56.071 --> 07:58.905
<i>She didn't have
very many friends.</i>

07:58.907 --> 08:01.574
She was very involved
in the church,

08:01.576 --> 08:03.475
um... would just go to school,

08:03.477 --> 08:05.678
and she would just hang out
with her brothers.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.446
Better hurry, Dorothy.

08:07.448 --> 08:09.849
You know how the Jacobs are
when we keep them waiting.

08:09.851 --> 08:11.483
Oh, I'm ready, George.

08:11.485 --> 08:13.220
I think it's safe to say
there won't be

08:13.222 --> 08:14.654
a handsomer couple
at the party.

08:14.656 --> 08:16.489
Or a happier one.

08:16.491 --> 08:18.491
<i>Where did the name
"Whitney" come from?</i>

08:18.493 --> 08:23.063
<i>My mother says something
about this white sitcom,</i>

08:23.065 --> 08:25.032
<i>but I never called her
Whitney.</i>

08:25.034 --> 08:27.533
<i>Always called her Nippy.</i>

08:27.535 --> 08:29.936
<i>Nippy is me. I am Nippy.</i>

08:29.938 --> 08:32.071
<i>My father gave me
that nickname,</i>

08:32.073 --> 08:34.841
<i>and I've been Nippy

08:43.052 --> 08:45.519
<i>Whitney's
father, John Houston,</i>

08:45.521 --> 08:48.088
<i>was a key player
in the 1970s</i>

08:48.090 --> 08:50.190
around the Gibson
administration,

08:50.192 --> 08:53.260
and he was
a real deal-maker.

08:53.262 --> 08:55.863
A deal-maker or a hustler?

08:55.865 --> 08:59.733
Well, it depends on which side
of the deal you're on. Ha, ha.

08:59.735 --> 09:02.603
<i>He was the head of
central planning and zoning</i>

09:02.605 --> 09:04.072
<i>in that administration,</i>

09:04.074 --> 09:06.774
<i>which was a very corrupt
administration,</i>

09:06.776 --> 09:08.809
<i>and to get
a building put up,</i>

09:08.811 --> 09:10.678
<i>you had to go through
my father.</i>

09:10.680 --> 09:12.748
<i>So... you do the math.</i>

09:13.883 --> 09:15.549
<i>He did enough for us,</i>

09:15.551 --> 09:17.151
along with my mother,
working hard,

09:17.153 --> 09:18.986
for us to get out of Newark

09:18.988 --> 09:21.088
and go to a house
in East Orange.

09:25.662 --> 09:29.230
<i>We had a better school,
a pool, a backyard.</i>

09:32.903 --> 09:36.171
<i>They were striving
to become middle class.</i>

09:36.173 --> 09:38.907
<i>They had
a really nice house.</i>

09:38.909 --> 09:43.311
They were the Cosbys
of Dodd Street.

09:43.313 --> 09:46.948
<i>But East Orange was

12:47.468 --> 12:50.335
<i>Why was she sent to
that private girls' school?</i>

12:50.337 --> 12:52.304
<i>To put her in
a safe environment,</i>

12:52.306 --> 12:55.407
<i>away from the bullying.</i>

12:55.409 --> 12:57.309
<i>This was the investment</i>

12:57.311 --> 13:00.413
<i>John and Cissy
were making in their daughter.</i>

13:00.415 --> 13:02.247
<i>They wanted her
to be educated,</i>

13:02.249 --> 13:05.918
<i>sophisticated,
and not streetwise.</i>

13:13.494 --> 13:16.995
<i>You know, it sounds
like I'm giving you the gas,</i>

13:16.997 --> 13:18.530
<i>but so help me.</i>

13:18.532 --> 13:22.833
<i>They had a really great
family dynamic going on.</i>

13:22.835 --> 13:25.338
But I've also heard
that she was bullied a lot.

13:25.340 --> 13:27.340
Did other things
happen to her as a child

13:27.342 --> 13:28.907
that might help to explain

13:28.909 --> 13:31.044
why she became
such a troubled person?

13:31.046 --> 13:34.079
No, Nippy didn't have
nothing bad in her childhood.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.915
I sound a little defensive,
you know.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.418
No, no. I'm just asking...

13:38.420 --> 13:41.321
Nippy, she did not have
anything in her childhood.

13:41.323 --> 13:44.392
She had an idyllic childhood.

13:45.793 --> 13:47.193
<i>She loved my father.</i>

13:47.195 --> 13:49.362
<i>Loved my father
and loved my mother.</i>

13:49.364 --> 13:52.131
<i>Them breaking up and getting
divorced really bothered her.</i>

13:52.133 --> 13:53.866
<i>It bothered me.</i>

13:53.868 --> 13:55.969
<i>What was it
that drove them apart?</i>

13:55.971 --> 13:57.305
<i>I don't know.</i>

13:59.107 --> 14:01.975
Infidelity.

14:01.977 --> 14:06.112
My dad,
despite whatever philandering

14:06.114 --> 14:09.282
he might have been doing,
was extremely jealous.

14:09.284 --> 14:11.050
<i>He had tapped the phone,</i>

14:11.052 --> 14:13.254
<i>so he's sitting
back in this office</i>

14:13.256 --> 14:16.357
<i>listening to Cissy's
conversations on the wiretap.</i>

14:21.564 --> 14:25.399
<i>The truth is Cissy
did have an affair</i>

14:25.401 --> 14:28.167
<i>with the minister
at her church.</i>

14:28.169 --> 14:31.505
I think about
my Father's house.

14:31.507 --> 14:34.140
- Yes, sir!
- In my Father's house,

14:34.142 --> 14:36.110
there's food.

14:36.112 --> 14:38.613
<i>You know, you're in
church, and you hear whispers.</i>

14:38.615 --> 14:40.983
None of them would
ever really get over it.

14:44.053 --> 14:46.854
<i>Her heart was broken.</i>

14:46.856 --> 14:52.259
<i>That church had been
Whitney's second family.</i>

14:52.261 --> 14:55.195
<i>And she was angry
with her mother.</i>

14:55.197 --> 14:59.032
<i>Whitney moved out as soon as
she was 18 years old.</i>

14:59.034 --> 15:03.204
<i>I don't think Cissy even knew
where she moved to.</i>

15:03.206 --> 15:05.105
<i>We had a good,
tight-knit family,</i>

15:05.107 --> 15:07.941
<i>but there were always
a lot of secrets in our lives.</i>

15:07.943 --> 15:09.644
<i>You know,
there were a lot of secrets.</i>

15:09.646 --> 15:12.547
<i>When you don't resolve things,
you don't deal with things,</i>

15:12.549 --> 15:15.049
they never go away.

15:15.051 --> 15:16.950
They never go away.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.393
<i>When I first
started working with her,</i>

15:25.395 --> 15:27.562
<i>she was modelling...</i>

15:27.564 --> 15:29.230
and she hated it

15:29.232 --> 15:31.399
because she knew that she
was gonna be a singer.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.368
That's what she knew.

15:33.370 --> 15:37.038
- <i>What did she like to do?</i>
- <i>She liked to sleep.</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:39.574
<i>She liked to party.</i>

15:39.576 --> 15:41.309
<i>She liked to hang out
with Robyn.</i>

15:41.311 --> 15:43.977
And she liked her cats.

15:43.979 --> 15:47.550
She had a
cat named Misty Blue.

15:47.552 --> 15:50.018
<i>It was obvious
that John and Cissy</i>

15:50.020 --> 15:52.954
<i>saw an opportunity
in Whitney.</i>

15:52.956 --> 15:55.957
<i>The plan was
to get her a record deal,</i>

15:55.959 --> 15:58.093
<i>but they didn't rush.</i>

15:58.095 --> 16:01.463
<i>For a long time she was
just singing background</i>

16:01.465 --> 16:03.699
<i>in Cissy's show.</i>

16:03.701 --> 16:06.968
<i>At that time,
there was a teenage star</i>

16:06.970 --> 16:10.438
<i>rising the charts,
and Whitney was angry.</i>

16:10.440 --> 16:15.378
She'd literally said she could
do that ten times better...

16:15.380 --> 16:17.413
and her parents
were holding her back.

16:17.415 --> 16:19.548
<i>I sat down with her
at the McDonald's</i>

16:19.550 --> 16:21.350
<i>across the street
from their home</i>

16:21.352 --> 16:25.221
<i>to explain to her the music
that she was envious of</i>

16:25.223 --> 16:27.123
was fad music...

16:27.125 --> 16:29.991
and what her parents
were preparing her for

16:29.993 --> 16:32.261
was legacy music.

16:32.263 --> 16:34.062
<i>My mother
was grooming her.</i>

16:34.064 --> 16:37.567
<i>When I look back, I remember
my mother grooming her.</i>

16:53.151 --> 16:56.419
Is it true that you were
sort of tricked into

16:56.421 --> 16:58.421
doing a solo performance?

16:58.423 --> 17:02.259
We were playing at this great
iconic R&B club in New York

17:02.261 --> 17:03.493
<i>called Mikell's.</i>

17:03.495 --> 17:05.429
<i>Cissy called Whitney...</i>

17:05.431 --> 17:07.731
She said, "Whitney,
I can't sing, I can't sing."

17:07.733 --> 17:10.133
She wasn't gonna be able
to do the show.

17:10.135 --> 17:12.736
My mom says, "You gotta do the
show. I can't let this gig go.

17:12.738 --> 17:15.605
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I can't do this, I'm 16... 17."

17:15.607 --> 17:19.275
And it was packed,
and she was adorable

17:19.277 --> 17:23.614
because she basically mimicked
her mom's everything,

17:23.616 --> 17:27.050
her patter. And just
substituted her own name

17:27.051 --> 17:30.053
for... you know, "Thanks
for coming to see Cissy."

17:30.055 --> 17:32.255
She'd go, "Thanks for coming
to hear Whitney."

17:38.263 --> 17:42.132
<i>I remember feeling
like a tornado, like a wind,</i>

17:42.134 --> 17:44.668
a monsoon of rain and wind
just hit me

17:44.670 --> 17:46.536
and, like, was just
throwing me back.

17:46.538 --> 17:49.707
That's how blown away I was
by this girl's voice.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.742

anything like it.

she says, "Hey, how you doing?"

18:17.838 --> 18:20.238
I said, "You." I said,
"What's wrong with you?

18:20.240 --> 18:21.740
You were sick."
She goes, "No.

18:21.742 --> 18:24.408
<i>I just wanted to see
if you could cut it."</i>

18:33.186 --> 18:35.623
<i>She blew the
roof off the place.</i>

18:38.726 --> 18:42.261
<i>And after that, we
started to seriously court</i>

18:42.263 --> 18:44.696
<i>the record companies.</i>

18:44.698 --> 18:47.366
At that time,
there were no singers

18:47.368 --> 18:50.636
that just stood up and sang,

18:50.638 --> 18:53.472
a mic and a light,

18:53.474 --> 18:54.806

come back again with flowers,

19:26.241 --> 19:27.907

would get bigger.

19:27.909 --> 19:31.377
She was innocent-looking,

- <i>Many times.</i>
- <i>How much was she?</i>

26:12.955 --> 26:15.222
<i>She was simple.
When Whitney was at home,</i>

26:15.224 --> 26:17.590
<i>Whitney wouldn't even
sleep in her bedroom.</i>

26:17.592 --> 26:20.828
<i>She'd sleep on the couch in
the family room and watch TV.</i>

26:20.830 --> 26:22.296
<i>You'd see her out there,</i>

26:22.298 --> 26:24.932
<i>making herself a little
pallet on the couch,</i>

26:24.934 --> 26:27.267
<i>and that's where
she would sleep at.</i>

26:27.269 --> 26:31.271
<i>Very simple.
Very, very simple.</i>

26:31.273 --> 26:35.809
<i>It was almost like...

26:35.811 --> 26:38.779

to get on stage.

26:38.781 --> 26:42.850
And when she came off, you
know, she became Nippy again.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.952
What about a boyfriend?
Anybody special?

26:44.954 --> 26:47.087
- No, not at the moment. No.
- Oh.

26:47.089 --> 26:49.723
So who do you think about

26:49.725 --> 26:51.658

something like that?

26:51.660 --> 26:53.127
People. People in general.

26:53.129 --> 26:55.629

26:58.167 --> 26:59.934

Yes, she did.
She talked about it.

27:17.120 --> 27:21.021
She liked it way more than
I needed to know.

27:21.023 --> 27:22.724
Yes.

27:22.726 --> 27:26.027
To the point
I was, like, scared for her,

27:26.029 --> 27:28.730
so I actually bought her
a vibrator

27:28.732 --> 27:30.965
for Christmas one year.

27:30.967 --> 27:34.369

He was chasing this woman.

28:09.273 --> 28:11.841
to pick up Whitney Houston
to take her for dinner.

28:11.843 --> 28:13.776
And it's 1987,
and you just feel like

28:13.778 --> 28:15.077
you're on top of the world.

28:15.079 --> 28:17.682

28:33.331 --> 28:35.432
<i>She was wise in a way.</i>

But then she was
still this 23-year-old girl

<i>Not too long

I did a radio show

32:04.212 --> 32:06.612
About 30 calls came in.

"What is the story

32:08.583 --> 32:10.484

32:36.312 --> 32:38.513
<i>That was the image

<i>Some of the family

<i>She was the only one

<i>Did John ever try

32:59.703 --> 33:02.370
- <i>He talked about it.</i>
- <i>What would he say?</i>

33:02.372 --> 33:04.972
<i>He said, if he could,

33:04.974 --> 33:06.708
<i>any way he can.</i>

33:06.710 --> 33:08.944
He wanted somebody
to scare her.

33:13.015 --> 33:14.716
<i>We refrained from that</i>

33:14.718 --> 33:17.619
<i>because you never know what

33:17.621 --> 33:21.155

you know, to do something.

33:21.157 --> 33:23.291
You just never know
what's going to happen.

33:23.293 --> 33:26.494
What did you make of John?

33:26.496 --> 33:31.399
He could be very charming,
but he was an opportunist.

33:31.401 --> 33:36.137
<i>And so he didn't hesitate
to get my dad out of there.</i>

33:36.139 --> 33:38.573
<i>He wanted to be

33:38.575 --> 33:41.576
<i>He didn't like the idea
of anyone else being in charge?</i>

33:41.578 --> 33:44.179
No, he was head, you know,
he was Captain Houston.

33:44.181 --> 33:47.616
Shit, are you kidding me?
Ha-ha-ha.

33:47.618 --> 33:50.085
<i>He loved being a boss.</i>

33:50.087 --> 33:52.655
<i>You had to kiss the ring,
and I mean that literally.</i>

33:52.657 --> 33:54.523
<i>He had a big-ass gold ring.</i>

33:54.525 --> 33:56.492
<i>He would ask
people to kiss his ring?</i>

33:56.494 --> 33:59.361
<i>Yeah, exactly.
I'll never forget it.</i>

33:59.363 --> 34:01.530
<i>And they did.</i>

34:01.532 --> 34:03.532
Nobody said, "Kiss my ass."

34:03.534 --> 34:07.736
I was young, but you still have
to question, you know,

34:07.738 --> 34:10.074
when someone says to you...

34:12.109 --> 34:13.476
"You know you made it

34:13.478 --> 34:15.578
when you got white people
working for you."

34:15.580 --> 34:18.214
A lot of times
I look at Whitney,

34:18.216 --> 34:20.817
and I can still see her
in braids,

34:20.819 --> 34:24.353
pigtails... walking around.

34:24.355 --> 34:28.456
It's hard for me
to deal with her as a star.

34:28.458 --> 34:30.391
It's very hard for me
to deal with her.

34:30.393 --> 34:34.364
I talk to her as a daughter.
She talks to me as her father.

34:34.366 --> 34:35.799
Suddenly he had a dream job.

34:35.801 --> 34:39.835
From $500 a week
to $500,000...

34:39.838 --> 34:42.371
...a year.

34:42.373 --> 34:45.708
Hi, Whitney.

34:45.710 --> 34:49.143
- Was that a good show, Daddy?
- That was a great show.

34:49.146 --> 34:52.549
<i>John Houston was a
civil servant in New Jersey,</i>

34:52.551 --> 34:55.451
<i>running over to Manhattan,

34:55.453 --> 34:57.453
<i>trying to find
some people to manage.</i>

34:57.455 --> 35:00.090
<i>And then all of a sudden,
his daughter...</i>

35:00.092 --> 35:03.393
<i>becomes one of the biggest
stars in the world,</i>

35:03.395 --> 35:06.096
<i>so John became a king too.</i>

35:06.098 --> 35:08.131
And John loved the fact

35:08.133 --> 35:11.735
that he could call
anybody in Hollywood,

35:11.737 --> 35:14.538
and they would take
the meeting immediately.

35:14.540 --> 35:18.042
It's a power he never thought
he would ever have.

35:19.878 --> 35:22.480
<i>Once John took over,
everybody in the family</i>

35:22.482 --> 35:24.348
<i>except Cissy
was on the payroll,</i>

35:24.350 --> 35:27.885
<i>and all the decisions
were just about,</i>

35:27.887 --> 35:31.254
you know, the money.

35:31.256 --> 35:33.724
Just playing a few cards here.
So there you go.

35:33.726 --> 35:36.594
Try and do a couple of hands.

35:36.596 --> 35:39.296
<i>I remember her
putting me and my brother</i>

35:39.298 --> 35:42.667
<i>on the payroll, when we didn't
even work for her at the time.</i>

35:44.536 --> 35:47.806
<i>So we got a check
every week in the mail, $200.</i>

35:47.808 --> 35:49.774
<i>And then we went on tour.</i>

35:49.776 --> 35:51.676
<i>And from there,
we got a salary,</i>

35:51.678 --> 35:55.379
<i>and then we had a retainer
when we weren't working.</i>

<i>Our 6'5" senior from
East Orange, New Jersey,</i>

36:04.324 --> 36:07.425
<i>number 24, Gary Garland.</i>

36:07.427 --> 36:11.195
<i>Gary had just
finished a career in the NBA.</i>

36:11.197 --> 36:13.432
<i>He was drafted to
the Denver Nuggets,</i>

36:13.434 --> 36:15.867
<i>and it was stated
in the papers</i>

36:15.869 --> 36:17.636
<i>that he was dropped
from the team</i>

36:17.638 --> 36:20.471
<i>for failing a drug test.</i>

36:20.473 --> 36:22.373
<i>That must have
been devastating.</i>

36:22.375 --> 36:23.942
<i>I went through hell.</i>

36:23.944 --> 36:26.310
I was depressed
for nine months.

36:26.312 --> 36:27.612
I'm talking about numb.

36:29.515 --> 36:32.416
<i>Then '85 came, when
my sister became a star,</i>

36:32.418 --> 36:35.187
<i>and I started
singing with her.</i>

36:35.189 --> 36:38.724
<i>I wasn't Gary.
I was Whitney's brother.</i>

36:40.928 --> 36:42.928
<i>For Gary, having to sing</i>

36:42.930 --> 36:47.466
<i>after having a basketball
career, was a letdown.</i>

36:47.468 --> 36:51.770
<i>On the outside, he wanted
to show he was having fun.</i>

36:51.772 --> 36:54.238
<i>I think he was dying inside.</i>

36:54.240 --> 36:56.307
You get it?
You get it now, right?

37:11.258 --> 37:14.459
<i>He had a job

<i>And we took care of Whitney,
me and my brother.</i>

37:48.396 --> 37:51.497
<i>We were her bodyguards.
We took care of her baggage.</i>

37:51.499 --> 37:54.367
We made sure she was safe,
and she was.

37:57.907 --> 38:00.874
<i>The idea was that
they could watch over her,</i>

38:00.876 --> 38:03.010
<i>and they could protect her.</i>

38:03.012 --> 38:04.879

38:08.383 --> 38:13.020

deeply then.

38:13.022 --> 38:15.422
After being on tour
for five or six months,

38:15.424 --> 38:17.958
I come home, you know.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.961
I spent time with my family,
but most times I was running.

38:20.963 --> 38:24.598
<i>A lot of parties to go to,
a lot of chicks...</i>

38:24.600 --> 38:26.867
<i>...a lot of drugs.</i>

38:26.869 --> 38:31.304
<i>You're Whitney's brother...

38:31.306 --> 38:33.306

38:38.081 --> 38:40.748
Whitney and I were very close,
like I said,

38:40.750 --> 38:42.616
and we spent
a lot of time together.

38:42.618 --> 38:45.019
And it wasn't like I was
ten years older than her,

38:45.021 --> 38:48.022
and I introduced her to drugs,
"Here, little girl." No.

38:48.024 --> 38:51.558
We graduated from
marijuana together.

38:51.560 --> 38:54.661
She wanted to try it.
I tried it. We tried it.

38:54.663 --> 38:56.930
<i>If anything
was gonna be done,</i>

38:56.932 --> 38:59.269
<i>I was gonna be the one
to show her.</i>

39:00.537 --> 39:03.471
Her age was probably
around 16.

39:06.076 --> 39:08.777
It was her birthday...

39:08.779 --> 39:12.549
and... I gave her
a bag of weed...

39:13.850 --> 39:17.685
and a little toke
of some cocaine.

39:17.687 --> 39:21.555

<i>I was the one that
went out and got drugs,</i>

<i>In Japan it's a no-no.
It's a taboo.</i>

39:47.785 --> 39:49.919
It was out in the open.

39:49.921 --> 39:53.388

it was right on the table.

39:53.390 --> 39:55.491

39:55.493 --> 39:58.393

48:27.213 --> 48:29.483
Wait!

48:32.419 --> 48:34.489
Yes!

48:37.057 --> 48:39.157
Robert Barisford Brown,

48:39.159 --> 48:42.227
do you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

48:42.229 --> 48:46.565
and do you solemnly promise
before God and these witnesses

48:46.567 --> 48:48.934
that you will love her
and comfort her,

48:48.936 --> 48:53.238
forsaking all others
for her alone?

48:53.240 --> 48:54.973
I do.

49:13.160 --> 49:17.331
<i>I think that was a very
difficult time for Robyn.</i>

49:20.000 --> 49:23.202
<i>When you love someone,
you want the best for them,</i>

49:23.204 --> 49:25.373
<i>even if it's not
the best for you.</i>

49:26.709 --> 49:31.043
<i>You know that, "If I leave,</i>

49:31.045 --> 49:33.980
<i>I can't think of anyone
that would protect her</i>

49:33.982 --> 49:37.118
<i>from these landmines
that are all around."</i>

49:41.723 --> 49:44.223
<i>Whitney believed
that if she got married,</i>

49:44.225 --> 49:46.025
<i>everything would be
wonderful,</i>

49:46.027 --> 49:48.228
<i>and she'd have
this great family.</i>

49:48.230 --> 49:52.435
<i>She'd have her baby, and she'd
just live happily ever after.</i>

49:54.570 --> 49:56.938
<i>She absolutely had
that fairy tale.</i>

49:58.774 --> 50:04.343
<i>To me, she was a little
girl wishing upon a star.</i>

50:04.345 --> 50:07.248
<i>She was always trying
to find her way back home.</i>

50:10.219 --> 50:13.721
This here is
a photograph of us in Italy.

50:13.723 --> 50:16.523
It was a time when, you know,
they were just married.

50:16.525 --> 50:20.327
We was on honeymoon and they
were into dressing alike.

50:20.329 --> 50:22.696
<i>I guess that was
the thing at that time.</i>

50:22.698 --> 50:26.400
<i>She was extremely happy.</i>

50:26.402 --> 50:29.572
Looking forward to starting
her life with her husband.

50:34.109 --> 50:36.611
<i>She called me when
she was on her honeymoon,</i>

50:36.613 --> 50:38.245
<i>and she said:</i>

50:38.247 --> 50:44.019
"Aunt Bae, I didn't get
my period. I'm pregnant."

50:46.155 --> 50:48.489
<i>Anyway, Krissi was born,</i>

50:48.491 --> 50:51.425
<i>and I'll never forget
that day.</i>

50:51.427 --> 50:53.293
<i>She came home early</i>

50:53.295 --> 50:56.129
<i>because she didn't want
to stay in the hospital.</i>

50:56.131 --> 50:58.566
<i>She came to the door,
and she was bent over.</i>

50:58.568 --> 51:02.136
And she had Krissi
in her arm.

51:02.138 --> 51:04.138
And I said, "Nippy,
what are you doing?"

51:04.140 --> 51:07.442
<i>She said, "Aunt Bae,
will you bathe her?"</i>

51:07.444 --> 51:09.577
<i>So I said,
"Of course I'll bathe her,"</i>

51:09.579 --> 51:11.615
<i>so I took the baby from her.</i>

51:13.350 --> 51:15.385
I never gave her back.

51:18.321 --> 51:24.560
She slept in a crib for
about two or three months...

51:24.562 --> 51:29.498
And then one night
she was colicky and gassy,

51:29.500 --> 51:31.332
and I put her in the bed
with me.

51:31.334 --> 51:34.168
And she slept with me
in that bed,

51:34.170 --> 51:39.075
wherever we were...
for the next eight years.

51:47.852 --> 51:51.620
- Point at the baby, Mommy.
- That's my daughter.

51:51.622 --> 51:53.589
That's me
and Bobby's little girl.

51:53.591 --> 51:56.659
She looks just like
her father, doesn't she?

51:59.564 --> 52:01.263
<i>I think, in the beginning,</i>

52:01.265 --> 52:03.234
<i>she was a good parent.</i>

52:05.235 --> 52:07.770
<i>Whitney hated
leaving Krissi.</i>

52:07.772 --> 52:10.540
<i>It's hard when you're working,
when you're traveling.</i>

52:10.542 --> 52:13.175
<i>She had the same situation
as her mom.</i>

52:13.177 --> 52:16.512
<i>But she insisted
on taking Krissi on tour.</i>

52:16.514 --> 52:19.582
Hey, baby, Krissi.

52:19.584 --> 52:21.818
Oh, you're the best kid
in the world.

52:21.820 --> 52:25.855
Thanks. You're the best kid
in the world!

52:25.857 --> 52:28.192
Thank you, mama. Thank you.

52:29.727 --> 52:31.527

59:15.807 --> 59:18.008

<i>"So you want to do movies?"

so you don't see my eyes."

01:00:00.787 --> 01:00:03.721
So I reached over
and took off her glasses.

01:00:03.723 --> 01:00:06.624
She was kind of shocked,

01:00:06.626 --> 01:00:09.227

and I thought:

01:00:09.229 --> 01:00:14.835
"You know, even if she's
a singer, I think she has..."

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:17.702

01:00:17.704 --> 01:00:19.905

motherfucking drugs.

01:11:50.778 --> 01:11:53.812

01:11:59.753 --> 01:12:00.919
What was Whitney's

01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:02.419
drug of choice
at that time?

01:12:02.421 --> 01:12:04.122
I'm sure it was cocaine,
you know.

01:12:04.124 --> 01:12:06.657
- Marijuana and cocaine.
- Was she smoking it?

01:12:06.659 --> 01:12:09.494
I'm sure she smoked it
inside the marijuana.

01:12:09.496 --> 01:12:11.097
If we can't talk about drugs,

01:12:11.099 --> 01:12:12.964
that makes it very hard
to talk about

01:12:12.966 --> 01:12:14.666
the last years of her life.

01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:15.803
Mm.

01:12:17.771 --> 01:12:20.705
I think we've just talked
about her life, you know.

01:12:20.707 --> 01:12:24.643
Drugs has nothing
to do with her life.

01:12:24.645 --> 01:12:27.846
<i>She was kind
and soft and sweet.</i>

01:12:27.848 --> 01:12:31.550
<i>And then she was
somebody different.</i>

01:12:31.552 --> 01:12:32.554
Tell it.

01:12:38.059 --> 01:12:40.394
What did you hear?

01:12:45.867 --> 01:12:47.334
Shh.

01:12:52.472 --> 01:12:54.606
That you had what?

01:13:07.488 --> 01:13:09.822
I wouldn't fuck
her with mine, dawg.

01:13:13.962 --> 01:13:16.095
No.

01:13:16.097 --> 01:13:18.463
<i>She started
canceling dates.</i>

01:13:18.465 --> 01:13:20.466
<i>I can recall
one particular time</i>

01:13:20.468 --> 01:13:23.170
<i>she was scheduled
to perform in California,</i>

01:13:23.172 --> 01:13:24.938
<i>and she was in California.</i>

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:27.673
<i>But she was at the airport,
sitting on a jet.</i>

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:29.609
<i>They had been getting high,</i>

01:13:29.611 --> 01:13:32.612
<i>and Bobby made a phone call
saying, "Tell the promoters</i>

01:13:32.614 --> 01:13:35.148
<i>to bring over X amount
of dollars, and we'll show up."</i>

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:36.883
I said, "That ain't
gonna happen.

01:13:36.885 --> 01:13:38.985
Take off, 'cause that
ain't gonna happen.

01:13:38.987 --> 01:13:40.820
That ain't how it works."
You know?

01:13:40.822 --> 01:13:42.455
"That is not how it works.

01:13:42.457 --> 01:13:45.826
Ain't nobody bringing you
a bag of cash!"

01:13:45.828 --> 01:13:49.596
<i>Everything began
to spiral out of control.</i>

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.766
<i>I talked to her father.</i>

01:13:52.768 --> 01:13:55.569
<i>I talked to her mother.
I talked to Donna Houston.</i>

01:13:55.571 --> 01:13:58.672
Every person
that you're gonna interview.

01:13:58.674 --> 01:14:02.910
<i>And I was able to get Cissy
to do an intervention.</i>

01:14:02.912 --> 01:14:06.179
<i>First of all, we walked in to
do it, and Whitney was stoned.</i>

01:14:06.181 --> 01:14:09.884
Then after it was over, when
she had agreed to go to rehab,

01:14:09.886 --> 01:14:11.920
she phoned her father,
and he told her:

01:14:11.922 --> 01:14:14.554
"You don't have to go."

01:14:14.556 --> 01:14:16.790
<i>Why didn't Cissy do more?</i>

01:14:16.792 --> 01:14:18.993
<i>She didn't want
Whitney mad at her.</i>

01:14:18.995 --> 01:14:21.828
<i>Because she'd been mad
at her earlier in her life?</i>

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:25.699
<i>Yeah. And when she tried,
she would go up to her house,</i>

01:14:25.701 --> 01:14:28.869
but Whitney wouldn't
let her in.

01:14:28.871 --> 01:14:32.173
You had to get permission
to go through that gate.

01:14:32.175 --> 01:14:34.842
Why would nobody
confront the situation?

01:14:34.844 --> 01:14:38.179
Money. Their jobs.
Their nice houses.

01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:40.715
<i>Their access
to other celebrities.</i>

01:14:40.717 --> 01:14:42.283
<i>The fact that,
in my opinion,</i>

01:14:42.285 --> 01:14:44.118
<i>they had
no marketable skill set,</i>

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.188
<i>other than being a Houston
or related to a Houston.</i>

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:50.158
<i>I mean, that's a lot.
That's hard to give up.</i>

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.127
<i>They probably felt, I guess,
a little bit in their defense,</i>

01:14:53.129 --> 01:14:54.929
that "She's choosing
to do this.

01:14:54.931 --> 01:14:56.932
Why should I give up
my lifestyle?"

01:14:56.934 --> 01:15:00.702
I once talked about
why she didn't stop,

01:15:00.704 --> 01:15:02.704
and she said, "I like it.

01:15:02.706 --> 01:15:05.140
And I'm gonna do it,
until I want to stop."

01:15:08.145 --> 01:15:10.647

<i>I always felt compassion
and empathy for her.</i>

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:09.800
<i>Deep down,
she was a girl in pain.</i>

01:23:09.802 --> 01:23:13.237
<i>But at the same time,
she was so fun.</i>

01:23:16.309 --> 01:23:18.174
<i>She was full of laughter,</i>

01:23:18.176 --> 01:23:21.482
<i>and that smile just made you
feel warm all the time.</i>

01:23:22.783 --> 01:23:25.282
Well, here she is,
everybody.

01:23:25.284 --> 01:23:28.385
Wait! I gotta get to you!

01:23:28.387 --> 01:23:30.689
We need you to rock it,
Whitney! Come back!

01:23:30.691 --> 01:23:33.825
<i>She was the first person
that I worked with in A&R.</i>

01:23:33.827 --> 01:23:35.459
You can't run
from the studio!

01:23:35.461 --> 01:23:37.495
I'm leaving!

01:23:37.497 --> 01:23:40.498
<i>We recorded
wherever they wanted to go.</i>

01:23:40.500 --> 01:23:42.266
<i>You know, we'd go to Miami</i>

01:23:42.268 --> 01:23:43.768
<i>because the weather
was better.</i>

01:23:43.770 --> 01:23:45.837
<i>I think we were there
three months,</i>

01:23:45.839 --> 01:23:48.406
and we recorded
less than two songs.

01:23:48.408 --> 01:23:49.708
Wow, what was...?

01:23:49.710 --> 01:23:52.410
What was happening
for those three months?

01:23:52.412 --> 01:23:54.111
Um...

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:56.314
She said to me once...

01:23:56.316 --> 01:23:58.316
After that, she said, "Baby,

01:23:58.318 --> 01:24:01.087
I don't think I slept
45 minutes this summer."

01:24:02.723 --> 01:24:04.623
<i>She would go behind
the hotel door</i>

01:24:04.625 --> 01:24:08.828
<i>and not open it
for 10 days or two weeks.</i>

01:24:08.830 --> 01:24:10.529
<i>When she opened it,</i>

01:24:10.531 --> 01:24:12.765
I could tell that
she lost weight.

01:24:12.767 --> 01:24:16.668
She wasn't looking healthy,
and I would take her and say:

01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:20.639
"Come on, Nippy, let's go.
Let's go get some soup."

01:24:20.641 --> 01:24:22.809
How long did
this all go on for?

01:24:23.610 --> 01:24:25.810
A few years.

01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:28.613
- A few years?
- Yeah.

01:24:28.615 --> 01:24:30.782
<i>How much do
you think you spent?</i>

01:24:30.784 --> 01:24:34.455
I hate to say.

01:24:35.523 --> 01:24:37.423
Millions.

01:24:37.425 --> 01:24:38.793
Five?

01:24:41.128 --> 01:24:42.795
Probably more.

<i>Why didn't the
label put a stop to this?</i>

01:24:50.772 --> 01:24:53.405
Well, the world wanted
to hear her again,

01:24:53.407 --> 01:24:56.845
and of course, the label
wanted to put out that record.

01:24:59.447 --> 01:25:02.248
There was so much
money spent on that album,

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:04.918
you must have known
about the drug use.

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:10.456
Uh, you know what, I never
knew there was any addiction.

01:25:10.458 --> 01:25:11.924
I never knew it.

Um, it was just kinda kept...

01:25:14.796 --> 01:25:16.862
I don't know if it was
kept away from me

01:25:16.864 --> 01:25:19.666
because I was, at the time,
the president of the label,

01:25:19.668 --> 01:25:20.834

- Yeah.
- "Is she sick?"

I'm not sick, Diane.

01:27:21.659 --> 01:27:23.425

No? What is it, Diane?
Tell me.

01:27:36.073 --> 01:27:39.341
Is it alcohol?
Is it marijuana?

01:27:39.343 --> 01:27:41.344
Is it cocaine? Is it pills?

01:27:43.982 --> 01:27:46.649

01:27:50.321 --> 01:27:51.923

I knew it was a disaster.

Crack is cheap.

01:28:16.948 --> 01:28:19.082
I make too much money
to ever smoke crack.

01:28:19.084 --> 01:28:21.451

okay?

01:28:21.453 --> 01:28:23.386
We don't do crack.

01:28:23.388 --> 01:28:26.556
We don't do that.
Crack is whack.

01:28:26.558 --> 01:28:29.826
I saw that interview and I
thought, "Why are we here?

01:28:29.828 --> 01:28:31.494
Why are we doing this?"

01:28:31.496 --> 01:28:33.731
I always thought,
"Why are we doing this?

01:28:33.733 --> 01:28:35.866
Why are we not doing
the one thing

01:28:35.868 --> 01:28:38.570
that would make the difference
for her life?"

01:28:39.538 --> 01:28:41.371
Which was getting well.

01:28:41.373 --> 01:28:43.475
I pray every day, Diane.

01:28:45.978 --> 01:28:47.710
I'm not the strongest

01:28:47.712 --> 01:28:49.512
but I'm not
the weakest either.

01:28:49.514 --> 01:28:51.748

<i>Michael Jackson

<i>and she would go over and sit

And they wouldn't even
say anything to each other.

01:30:09.797 --> 01:30:11.230

01:30:11.232 --> 01:30:13.531

01:30:17.804 --> 01:30:22.108
who could understand
what their circumstances were.

01:30:22.110 --> 01:30:26.845
<i>And it was just being close
to each other.</i>

01:30:26.847 --> 01:30:29.614
<i>Whitney Houston has

01:30:29.616 --> 01:30:32.151

01:30:33.922 --> 01:30:35.855
<i>Houston said she is using

<i>to help her get over
her addiction.</i>

01:30:37.825 --> 01:30:40.059
<i>A number of times
she went away into rehab,</i>

01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:42.194
<i>and she never managed
to get clean.</i>

01:30:42.196 --> 01:30:44.263
I know it's
a pretty complicated answer,

01:30:44.265 --> 01:30:46.564
- but why was that?
- No, I don't think...

01:30:46.566 --> 01:30:48.000
It's not complicated.

01:30:48.002 --> 01:30:51.536
Because...
to go into treatment,

01:30:51.538 --> 01:30:53.705
you have to go for you.

01:30:53.707 --> 01:30:56.509
Not for someone else.

01:30:56.511 --> 01:31:00.047

<i>Is there something in

<i>particularly difficult

A family member of mine.
You know.

01:31:40.255 --> 01:31:42.856

happened to Whitney?

01:32:03.078 --> 01:32:04.880
I have heard it.

01:32:07.083 --> 01:32:09.784
I have heard it.

she never liked the idea
of me leaving her behind.

<i>And then, as mothers,</i>

01:32:28.171 --> 01:32:31.806
<i>we talked,

<i>We was talking one day,</i>

01:32:37.314 --> 01:32:39.180
<i>'cause she knows my sister,</i>

01:32:39.182 --> 01:32:43.385
<i>and my sister was molested
at an early age.</i>

01:32:43.387 --> 01:32:45.286
And she looked up at me,

01:32:45.288 --> 01:32:48.890
and she says,
"Mary, I was too."

01:32:48.892 --> 01:32:50.625
I said, "Huh?"

01:32:50.627 --> 01:32:54.228
She said, "Yeah, I was
molested at a young age too."

01:32:54.230 --> 01:32:59.201
She said, "But it wasn't
a man, it was a woman."

01:32:59.203 --> 01:33:01.636
<i>And she had tears
in her eyes.</i>

01:33:01.638 --> 01:33:04.942
<i>She says, "Mommy don't know
the things we went through."</i>

01:33:07.044 --> 01:33:10.878
<i>I said, "Nip, have you
ever told your mother?"</i>

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:14.149
<i>She says, "No."</i>

01:33:14.151 --> 01:33:16.851
<i>I said, "Well, maybe
you need to tell her."</i>

01:33:16.853 --> 01:33:18.787
<i>She said,
"You don't know my mother.</i>

01:33:18.789 --> 01:33:22.593
<i>My mother would hurt somebody
if I told her who it was."</i>

01:33:24.095 --> 01:33:27.062
And she just had tears
rolling down her eyes,

01:33:27.064 --> 01:33:29.198
and I just hugged her.

01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.800
I said, "Well, one day,
when you get the nerve,

01:33:31.802 --> 01:33:35.070
you need to tell your mother,
and it will lift the burden.

01:33:35.072 --> 01:33:36.674
It will lift the burden
off you."

01:33:39.143 --> 01:33:41.143
<i>What makes you angry?</i>

01:33:41.145 --> 01:33:43.046
<i>Child abuse makes me angry.</i>

01:33:43.048 --> 01:33:45.448
<i>Why child abuse? You
come from a loving family.</i>

01:33:45.450 --> 01:33:48.784

'Cause for children...</i>

01:33:48.786 --> 01:33:53.156

children who are helpless,</i>

01:34:12.378 --> 01:34:15.380
Yes. She did.

01:34:17.415 --> 01:34:19.482
She did.

01:34:19.484 --> 01:34:22.185
Gary told me that
it was Dee Dee Warwick,

01:34:22.187 --> 01:34:24.120

01:34:24.122 --> 01:34:26.089

01:34:26.091 --> 01:34:28.858
Yeah, that's what
she told me.

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.162
"It was Dee Dee."
And I said, "What?"

01:34:31.164 --> 01:34:33.065

"I know, I know,

<i>"Krissi, why did you
go in the room?"</i>

01:39:59.163 --> 01:40:02.331
"Well, I was looking for
something, Auntie Mary."

01:40:02.333 --> 01:40:04.266
She said, "What the hell...?"

01:40:04.268 --> 01:40:06.402
I said, "Krissi..."

01:40:06.404 --> 01:40:08.204
What did she see?

01:40:08.206 --> 01:40:13.109
Oh, her father
used to like to... draw

01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:19.382
all these devils and demons
on the floors and the walls.

01:40:19.384 --> 01:40:23.788

out of a storybook to me.

01:40:25.857 --> 01:40:29.225

<i>She was the best mother

no one would ever imagine.

01:41:01.627 --> 01:41:04.795
They didn't take care
of Krissi.

01:41:04.797 --> 01:41:07.431
They just
left her to the wolves.

01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:11.304
She never had a chance.

<i>She'd never

<i>She was the companion of an
alcoholic and a drug addict.</i>

<i>And that was what
she learned to be.</i>

01:41:38.464 --> 01:41:42.135
<i>Whitney asked me to
meet her at the hospital.</i>

01:41:43.670 --> 01:41:48.175
Krissi had taken a knife
and slashed her arms.

01:41:52.746 --> 01:41:54.681
That's awful.

01:41:56.483 --> 01:41:59.753
- <i>Why did she do it?</i>
- <i>She hated her life.</i>

01:42:01.254 --> 01:42:03.955
<i>She hated her mother.</i>

01:42:03.957 --> 01:42:06.392
<i>She even went

she wanted to leave.

and people who loved her.

back to, you know, Alpharetta

01:49:47.263 --> 01:49:50.031
