07:55.743 --> 07:57.310
TO THE NEW CHER LLOYD SINGLE.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.747
IT SHOULD BE CHER-RIFFIC.

08:00.881 --> 08:03.050
- OKAY,
WHICH ONE OF THESE ACTORS

08:03.050 --> 08:06.053
LOOKS LIKE THE BAD BOYFRIEND
YOU WROTE THE SONG ABOUT?

08:06.053 --> 08:08.088
JUST PICK ONE.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.189

08:10.891 --> 08:13.393
MM, EYEBROWS TOO SMALL.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.063
HMM, HE'S CLOSE.

[record needle scratching]

08:18.165 --> 08:19.399

YOUR NEW SONG?

08:22.570 --> 08:23.837
BY THE WAY,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.673
THESE GUYS
LOOK NOTHING LIKE ME.

THERE'S LUCY!

08:27.941 --> 08:29.743

I CALLED E! NEWS,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.750
AND THEY DO MAKE ME FURIOUS,

08:36.750 --> 08:38.485
BUT THEY ARE ALSO FAIR.

08:38.485 --> 08:39.587
- AND WE CAN EXPLAIN

08:39.587 --> 08:40.988
THAT CARLOS WAS HELPING
THE OLD LADY,

08:40.988 --> 08:42.022
NOT HURTING.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.491
- OH!

08:44.491 --> 08:46.493
- NO, STAY AWAY
FROM THAT GRANNY.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.328
- BUT SHE DROPPED HER PURSE!

08:48.328 --> 08:50.230
- THAT IS HER PROBLEM,
NOT OURS!

08:50.230 --> 08:51.732
- I KNOW, BUT SHE CAN'T
PICK IT UP.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.233
- FINE. FINE.

08:53.233 --> 08:56.069
I'LL HELP HER, OKAY?

09:36.143 --> 09:37.244
WITH CHER LLOYD!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.311
- I CAN'T EITHER,

09:38.311 --> 09:40.380
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T
ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.548
- AH, BUT REMEMBER,

09:41.548 --> 09:43.016
IT'S NOT ABOUT
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED;

09:43.016 --> 09:45.118
IT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK
HAPPENED.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.120
thud!

09:47.120 --> 09:48.789

09:56.229 --> 09:58.231
SO LET ME START BY SAYING,
UH, ONE,

09:58.231 --> 10:00.834
IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.103
AND, TWO...

10:06.139 --> 10:07.240
- WAIT!

10:07.240 --> 10:09.843
I CAN'T RUN VERY FAST
IN THESE HEELS!

10:09.843 --> 10:13.847
[dramatic music]

10:13.847 --> 10:16.183
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S PRETTY PRESUMPTUOUS OF YOU

10:16.183 --> 10:17.718
TO ASSUME THAT
YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER

10:17.718 --> 10:18.786
IS ABOUT YOU.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.220
- IT'S NOT?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.822
- NO, OF COURSE IT IS.

10:21.822 --> 10:22.990
- [sighs]

10:22.990 --> 10:24.992
- LOOK,
I KNOW YOU MAY HATE ME,

10:24.992 --> 10:26.493
BUT IF YOU SWIFT ME,

10:26.493 --> 10:28.829
YOU'RE SWIFTING
THE WHOLE BAND,

10:28.829 --> 10:30.630
AND THEY DON'T DESERVE THAT.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.800
- I DON'T HATE YOU,

10:32.800 --> 10:33.967
AND I LOVE THE GUYS,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.136
SO DON'T SWEAT IT.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.005
I WON'T SAY
THE SONG IS ABOUT YOU.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.639
- GREAT!

10:39.639 --> 10:40.974
THANK YOU.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.444
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

10:44.444 --> 10:45.779
- THE SONG IS GREAT,
BY THE WAY,

10:45.779 --> 10:48.949
BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY
ACCURATE.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.350
- HMM, HOW SO?

10:50.350 --> 10:52.185
- DOESN'T MATTER.
LET'S GO.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.353
- [scoffs]

10:53.353 --> 10:54.955
WELL, I DIDN'T DUMP YOU
FOR JO

10:54.955 --> 10:57.691
BECAUSE WE WERE NEVER
OFFICIALLY GOING OUT.

10:57.691 --> 10:58.992
- WE WEREN'T?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.395
- WE REALLY SHOULD BE GOING.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.198
- WELL, NO, BECAUSE
IT WAS MORE LIKE HALF A DATE.

11:05.198 --> 11:09.002
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S NO RHYME
FOR "HALF A DATE."

11:09.002 --> 11:11.271
- "HAVE TO WAIT."
BOOM.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.273
- OKAY.
RHYME THIS.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.108
SEE YOU

11:15.108 --> 11:17.945
WHERE I TELL THE ENTIRE WORLD

11:17.945 --> 11:20.047
AND THAT
YOU'RE A TOTAL JERKFACE.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.016

WHERE SHE WILL REVEAL

11:29.757 --> 11:32.392
OF THE DATING JERKFACE
SHE SINGS ABOUT

11:32.392 --> 11:33.861
IN HER NEW HIT SINGLE.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.129
[both screaming]

11:40.233 --> 11:42.770

11:42.770 --> 11:46.073
FOR US ALL TO GET TOGETHER
AND HAVE A LITTLE RECAP.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.207
AND LET'S START WITH--

11:47.207 --> 11:49.642
I SAID NO SCANDALS!

11:49.642 --> 11:53.646
- UH, WELL, LUCY DID AGREE
TO SAY HER SONG WASN'T ABOUT ME.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.648
- BUT THEN

11:55.648 --> 11:58.418

12:03.857 --> 12:05.458
TWO GRANNY SCANDALS.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.127
- TECHNICALLY,
WE SHOULD COUNT THAT

12:07.127 --> 12:09.229
AS ONE LARGE GRANNY SCANDAL.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.630
- HMM, YEAH, TECHNICALLY...

12:10.630 --> 12:12.232
[screams]

12:12.232 --> 12:13.934
- WHY CAN'T YOU GUYS
BE MORE LIKE JAMES?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.069
HE GOT A DUET WITH CHER LLOYD.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.470

12:17.470 --> 12:19.807
I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE
RECAPPING!

12:19.807 --> 12:22.309

12:38.225 --> 12:41.628

12:41.628 --> 12:43.563
- CHER'S HERE.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.832
- [yelps]

12:44.832 --> 12:47.434
- HELLO, JAMES.
I'D LIKE A LITTLE WORD WITH YOU.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.136
- CHER, I'M SO SORRY

12:49.136 --> 12:50.838
BUT BIG TIME RUSH

12:50.838 --> 12:52.739
AND YOU AND ME SINGING TOGETHER

12:52.739 --> 12:54.074
'CAUSE YOU'RE COOL
AND AWESOME--

12:54.074 --> 12:55.075
PLEASE, NOT THE FACE.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.276
- CALM DOWN!

12:56.276 --> 12:57.610
I GUESS THERE'S NO HARM DONE.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.247
BUT AFTER MY VIDEO SHOOT
TODAY,

13:00.247 --> 13:02.149
I SHALL BE RELEASING
A STATEMENT

13:02.149 --> 13:03.316
SAYING THAT YOU AND I

13:03.316 --> 13:04.985
WERE JUST MESSING AROUND
FOR THE CAMERAS

13:04.985 --> 13:07.855
AND THERE IS NO DUET.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.689
- I LIKE IT.
SMART.

13:09.689 --> 13:11.191

13:13.861 --> 13:16.029
- READY TO CRASH
CHER'S MUSIC VIDEO?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.365
- * DUET TIME

13:18.365 --> 13:20.700
- SO THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT
CELEBRITY SCANDAL

13:20.700 --> 13:22.702
IS TO COUNTER BAD PRESS

13:22.702 --> 13:24.037
WITH GOOD PRESS.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.705
- SO WE RECORD FOOTAGE

13:25.705 --> 13:28.175
OF US HELPING AN OLD LADY
ACROSS THE STREET.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.677

13:30.677 --> 13:34.181
AND BIG TIME GRANNY SCANDAL
IS OVER!

13:34.181 --> 13:36.183
- I HATE ALL OF YOU.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.350

13:45.058 --> 13:46.093
I NEED TO SEE YOUR FACES.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.094

13:47.094 --> 13:48.095
[horn blaring]

13:48.095 --> 13:49.129
- [screams]

13:49.129 --> 13:51.464
- WHERE DID HE GO?

13:51.464 --> 13:52.799
GUSTAVO?

13:52.799 --> 13:53.901
- WHERE DID HE GO?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.203
- LET'S FACE IT.

13:56.203 --> 13:57.704
THIS SCANDAL IS BIGGER
THAN WE ARE,

13:57.704 --> 13:59.706
AND WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME HELP.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.441
- OKAY, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.311
FIRST, YOU NEED SOME ANT SPRAY
AND A BURLAP SACK.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.712
- STOP RIGHT THERE.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.114
- JUST GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH LUCY.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.148
SHE'LL FORGIVE YOU.

14:08.148 --> 14:09.416
CANCEL THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.450
AND I'LL DATE JO.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.618
- NO!

14:11.618 --> 14:13.020
- ALL RIGHT,
FORGET ABOUT THE ANT SPRAY

14:13.020 --> 14:14.254
AND THE BURLAP SACK.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.524
NOW, HOW LONG CAN THE TWO OF YOU
HOLD YOUR BREATH?

14:17.524 --> 14:18.558
- STOP IT.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.760
- I DISGUISE MYSELF AS LUCY,

14:20.760 --> 14:23.096
SAY THE SONG
IS NOT ABOUT KENDALL,

14:23.096 --> 14:24.397
THEN TELL THE WHOLE WORLD

14:24.397 --> 14:26.666
TO WATCH CAMILLE ROBERTS'
AMAZING PERFORMANCE

14:26.666 --> 14:29.102
IN ROCK CAMP 9: STILL CAMPIN'.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.539
WHAT?
I COULD USE THE EXPOSURE.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.808
- WELL, THAT'S IT.
I'M GETTING SWIFTED.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.710
LUCY'S GONNA SAY IT'S ME
AT HER PRESS CONFERENCE,

14:37.710 --> 14:39.712
AND MY REPUTATION
WILL BE DESTROYED.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.482
- WELL, SINCE SHE SWIFTED YOU,

14:42.482 --> 14:43.716
WHY DON'T YOU JUST KANYE HER?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.817
- GREAT IDEA!

14:44.817 --> 14:46.086
WHAT'S THE CAVEMAN
TALKING ABOUT?

14:46.086 --> 14:47.654
- KANYE WEST
BLOCKED TAYLOR SWIFT

14:47.654 --> 14:48.688
FROM SPEAKING ONSTAGE.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.023
HE JUST KEPT TALKING,

14:50.023 --> 14:51.758
AND SHE COULD NEVER
GET A WORD IN.

14:51.758 --> 14:55.295
- SO WE GET INTO HER
PRESS CONFERENCE

14:55.295 --> 14:56.696
AND KEEP HER FROM SWIFTING ME.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.665
- AND HOW ARE WE GONNA DO THAT?

14:58.665 --> 14:59.732

14:59.732 --> 15:01.668
OKAY, EVERYBODY.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.950
LET'S JUST HOPE THE OTHER GUYS
GET RID OF THEIR SCANDALS TOO.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.187
- DID YOU GUYS GET THE FOOTAGE?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.788
BUS!
[chuckles]

17:01.788 --> 17:04.091
DO PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU'RE NICE
TO OLD LADIES?

17:04.091 --> 17:05.192
BUS!

17:05.192 --> 17:06.593
- THE ONLY THING
THAT PEOPLE KNOW

17:06.593 --> 17:07.994
IS WHAT E! SHOWED THEM

17:07.994 --> 17:10.530
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY FOOTAGE
OF CARLOS' BEE SLAP

17:10.530 --> 17:12.199
AND LOGAN'S PURSE SNATCH.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.101
- AGH!

17:14.101 --> 17:16.369
WAIT.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.738
SECURITY CAMERAS.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.641
- GO! GO! GO! GO!

17:21.641 --> 17:23.943
THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ANGLES
THAT SHOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

17:23.943 --> 17:25.978
- AND THEN WE CAN SEND IT TO E!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.347

- THIS JUST IN:

17:33.353 --> 17:34.521
NEW FOOTAGE THAT PROVES

17:34.521 --> 17:36.923
BIG TIME RUSH
IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL

17:36.923 --> 17:38.591
AND NOT HURTFUL
TO OLD LADIES.

17:38.591 --> 17:39.992
all: YES!

17:39.992 --> 17:42.129
- BUT BIG TIME SCANDALS
STILL REMAIN

17:42.129 --> 17:45.365
AS THE WORLD WAITS
FOR POP PRINCESS LUCY STONE

17:45.365 --> 17:48.568
TO ANNOUNCE THE IDENTITY
OF THE JERKFACE BOYFRIEND

17:48.568 --> 17:49.669
IN HER SONG.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.837
IS IT KENDALL KNIGHT?

17:50.837 --> 17:54.574

17:58.278 --> 18:00.313
KENDALL COULDN'T STOP
THE PRESS CONFERENCE!

18:00.313 --> 18:03.049
- AH! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HIDING FROM CHER.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.618
- [yelps]

18:05.618 --> 18:08.688
- JAMES, GET UP.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.590
- PLEASE, CHER,
NOT THE FACE.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.160
[dramatic music]

18:13.160 --> 18:15.162
- YOU'RE LUCKY,
YOU CHEEKY CHIPMUNK.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.363

18:16.363 --> 18:17.430
- YEAH. COME AGAIN?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.931
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT

18:18.931 --> 18:21.434
MY DIRECTOR LOVED THE VIDEO
WITH YOU IN IT.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.803
AND HE RELEASED
A CUT OF IT ONLINE

18:23.803 --> 18:25.405
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.808
BUT THE FANS LOVED IT,

18:28.808 --> 18:31.478
AND WE GOT
10 MILLION HITS ONLINE.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.214
SEE?

18:34.214 --> 18:36.516
- COOL.
- OKAY, WELL, I'VE GOT TO RUN.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.186
I'VE GOT TO SEE MY DIRECTOR
IN THE HOSPITAL.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.653
- WHY IS HE IN THE HOSPITAL?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.189
- WELL, LIKE I SAID,

18:42.189 --> 18:45.492
HE RELEASED THE VIDEO
WITHOUT MY APPROVAL.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.827
- AND I'VE GOT TO RUN TOO.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.330
LUCY'S ABOUT TO TAYLOR SWIFT
MY BEST FRIEND!

18:50.330 --> 18:52.565
- HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THEM?

18:52.565 --> 18:53.766
- IT'S SO HARD.

18:53.766 --> 18:57.036
- * YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER

18:57.036 --> 18:58.671
* YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD

[crowd murmuring]

19:00.207 --> 19:03.210
[camera shutters clicking]

19:07.680 --> 19:09.382
- RUMORS HAVE BEEN SWIRLING

19:09.382 --> 19:12.219
AS TO WHO MY SONG
YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER IS ABOUT

19:12.219 --> 19:14.221
AND WHETHER OR NOT
IT'S KENDALL KNIGHT.

19:14.221 --> 19:16.656
AND I'M HERE NOW
TO TELL YOU ALL THE TRUTH

19:16.656 --> 19:18.625
AND TO ANSWER
ALL YOUR QUESTIONS.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.461
- YES, CANDY CANDERSON,
SCANDALICIOUS MAGAZINE.

19:21.461 --> 19:25.265
CAN YOU NAME EVERY STAR
IN THE UNIVERSE?

19:25.265 --> 19:26.799
AND GO.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.235
- UM...

19:28.235 --> 19:31.238
I WAS THINKING THE QUESTIONS
WOULD BE MORE ABOUT THE SONG.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.805
- I HAVE A QUESTION.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.308
CAN YOU SEE ME WHEN I DO THIS?

19:35.308 --> 19:37.310
'CAUSE I CAN'T SEE YOU.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.445
- YES, I CAN SEE YOU.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.549
- UH...

19:42.549 --> 19:43.650
UH, DO YOU THINK BANANA BREAD

19:43.650 --> 19:45.518
MAKES AN EFFECTIVE BAIT
FOR MONKEY FISH?

19:45.518 --> 19:47.920
ALSO, I HAVE
18 FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS.

19:47.920 --> 19:48.955
- BUDDHA BOB.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.323
- YEAH.
UH, NO!

19:50.323 --> 19:51.324
- YOU'RE BUSTED!

19:51.324 --> 19:52.525
QUICK. HIDE.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.697
- THE QUESTION I WANT TO ANSWER

19:57.697 --> 19:59.632
IS WHO THE GUY IN MY SONG IS,

19:59.632 --> 20:01.868
AND, IN FACT,
HE IS SITTING RIGHT--

20:01.868 --> 20:03.270
- WHAT IF...

20:03.270 --> 20:04.604
[record needle scratching]

20:04.604 --> 20:08.908
YOU WERE WRONG
ABOUT THE JERKFACE IN YOUR SONG?

20:08.908 --> 20:09.909
[clears throat]

20:09.909 --> 20:12.245
- MAYBE HE WAS JUST
REALLY CONFUSED

20:12.245 --> 20:13.480
AND NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU

20:13.480 --> 20:15.382
AND IS THE COOLEST GUY I KNOW.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.583
[clears throat]

20:16.583 --> 20:19.686
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD DATE
JAMES DIAMOND INSTEAD

20:19.686 --> 20:20.687
AND MAKE OUT WITH HIM.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.054
[chuckles]

20:22.054 --> 20:23.189
I MEAN...

20:23.189 --> 20:25.057

HELP US.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.726
- OKAY.
[chuckles]

20:26.726 --> 20:28.961
THE SONG
YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER

20:28.961 --> 20:31.364
IS REALLY ABOUT...

20:31.364 --> 20:34.801
[crowd murmuring]

20:34.801 --> 20:38.405
[dramatic music]

20:38.405 --> 20:40.206
NOT KENDALL KNIGHT.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.608
[crowd murmuring]

20:41.608 --> 20:43.943
IT'S A COMBINATION

20:43.943 --> 20:45.912
OF A FEW DIFFERENT GUYS
I'VE KNOWN.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.682
I HAD ONE KISS
AND HALF A DATE WITH KENDALL.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.051
AND IT WAS VERY SWEET.

20:52.051 --> 20:56.088
IT WAS GREAT
TO SEE ALL OF YOU AGAIN.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.357

20:59.426 --> 21:03.796
* YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER

21:05.432 --> 21:07.400
- SO AFTER ALL THE HOOPLA,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.936
IT TURNS OUT
THAT LUCY STONE'S SMASH

21:09.936 --> 21:11.137
YOU DUMPED ME FOR HER

21:11.137 --> 21:13.205
IS NOT ABOUT KENDALL KNIGHT,

21:13.205 --> 21:16.208
WHO IS NOT A TOTAL JERKFACE.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.577
- [quietly]
YES!

21:17.577 --> 21:18.878
- I GOT TO SAY,

21:18.878 --> 21:20.713
THAT WAS REALLY NICE OF LUCY
TO DO THAT.

21:20.713 --> 21:21.781
both: AGREED!

21:21.781 --> 21:23.850
- AND IT WAS REALLY NICE OF YOU

21:23.850 --> 21:25.017
NOT TO GET MAD AT ME.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.754
THOSE LYRICS WERE
KIND OF HURTFUL.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.155
- THEY'RE JUST LYRICS.

21:29.155 --> 21:32.425
AND WE CAN ALWAYS TURN OFF
THE SONG AND FORGET ABOUT IT.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.926
- TRUE.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.994
- I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE LUCY

21:34.994 --> 21:36.429
IS LIVING HERE
TO KEEP REMINDING US.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.197
- HEY, GUYS.

21:38.197 --> 21:39.999
I'M MOVING BACK
INTO THE PALMWOODS.
