11:41.309 --> 11:43.006
So they won't see us coming.

11:43.050 --> 11:46.227
Then hiking 20 kilometers
through hostile territory.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.055
You read the brief.
Good.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.665
Now hold on to your saddles,

11:49.709 --> 11:51.580
it's gonna get
a little choppy on descent.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.742
Hold up,
I need to fill you in

12:22.785 --> 12:25.005
on a unique condition
of our being here.

12:28.225 --> 12:31.533
We cannot risk
any further contamination,

12:31.576 --> 12:33.578
so we're not bringing
any of the usual tech.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.972
Spock mocked up
some items consistent with

12:36.016 --> 12:38.061
the planet's
current development.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.153
Are you joking?

12:43.197 --> 12:44.807
We just said
this is hostile territory.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.809
I brought the both of you
for a reason.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.724
Kalar warriors are fierce.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.421
M'BENGA:
You needed fighters

12:50.465 --> 12:52.684
who can handle themselves
without a phaser.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.599
We've got subdermal
universal translators.

12:54.643 --> 12:55.513
That's all we'll need.

12:55.557 --> 12:56.906
And if things go sideways again?

12:56.950 --> 12:59.822
They won't.
But if they do,

12:59.866 --> 13:02.129
I trust the three of us
to handle it.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.266
-You're good?
-I'm fine.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.616
Doctors love
being tasked for a mission

13:11.660 --> 13:13.314
because of their combat skills.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.405
[high-pitched ringing]

13:27.676 --> 13:30.026
[ringing stops]

13:30.070 --> 13:32.681
PIKE [echoing]:
La'An.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.204
[echo fades]:
Hey, La'An.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.427
La'An.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.299
You all right?

13:44.258 --> 13:45.999
Sorry, what was-what
was I saying?

13:48.088 --> 13:49.872
Lieutenant?

13:51.265 --> 13:52.788
How are you feeling?

13:54.485 --> 13:56.052
Not gonna lie,
a little light-headed,

13:56.096 --> 13:57.532
but, um, I'm past it now.

13:57.575 --> 14:00.143
Do you have any other symptoms?

14:00.187 --> 14:01.841
Maybe...

14:01.884 --> 14:04.887
For a moment, I heard this...
this ringing in my ears.

14:06.019 --> 14:09.152
Tinnitus.
Could be the altitude.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.676
To be sure,
I have to run a diagnostic.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.940
We're six hours
from where we hid the shuttle.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.116
Six hours, really?

14:20.294 --> 14:21.991
It's not too far to go back.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.646
We'd never make it by nightfall.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.561
Temperature drops drastically,
it gets deadly.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.912
No, our best tactical option
is to move forward.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.262
Clear these foothills,
get into the valley.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.525
I'm not so sure.

14:34.569 --> 14:37.267
Is your official diagnosis
that we need to go back?

14:37.311 --> 14:39.052
No.

14:40.053 --> 14:41.532
Her pulse is normal.

14:41.576 --> 14:44.361
Other than momentary confusion,

14:44.405 --> 14:46.102
I see no reason to turn around.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.799
La'An?

14:48.844 --> 14:50.802
I'll be fine, Captain.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.717
All right.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.371
Let's get into the valley.

14:54.415 --> 14:55.764
Find our objective,
make camp for the night there.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.635
Sir.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.162
La'An's breathed
thinner air than this.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.686
I hope it really is nothing.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.211
LA'AN:
It's not just the garden.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.170
They've put the Delta
on the entryway.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.867
PIKE:
We need to speak to Kalar
who live outside the palace.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.477
They're more likely
to talk to us.

15:13.521 --> 15:15.305
Maybe they can tell us
what it means to them.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.307
LA'AN:
And if that fails,
we blend in as servants,

15:17.351 --> 15:19.440
-infiltrate the castle.
-[brief, high-pitched ringing]

15:19.483 --> 15:21.485
[sharp inhale, exhale]

15:21.529 --> 15:24.532
-You all right?
-[sighs]

15:24.575 --> 15:26.447
Yeah, it's nothing, just a...

15:26.490 --> 15:27.970
headache.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.624
Probably need to eat something.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.148
Or M'Benga was right.

15:32.192 --> 15:35.108
Maybe we lay low tonight,
make for the shuttle at dawn.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.937
No.
Captain, you need to see this.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.864
Spock was bleeding out
when I ordered the evac.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.692
We fought our way
back to the landing zone.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.912
I wasn't exactly tracking gear
at that point.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.392
Captain!

15:59.480 --> 16:00.960
Captain...

16:01.003 --> 16:02.962
we've got company.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.971
Three on six. We've got this.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.016
Let's try diplomacy first.

16:15.583 --> 16:17.541
Greetings.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.066
My friends and I have traveled
far from the north.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.850
We apologize
if we're trespassing.

16:21.893 --> 16:23.417
We mean no disrespect.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.768
[whirring up]

16:26.811 --> 16:28.291
We know you come from Starfleet.

16:33.296 --> 16:36.212
[high-pitched ringing]

16:38.258 --> 16:40.086
GUARD [echoing]:
Get going. Move it.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.435
[ringing, echo fades]

16:41.478 --> 16:43.002
What is this place?

16:44.090 --> 16:45.613
Where are you taking us?

16:45.656 --> 16:48.703
MAN:
I saw that little streak
in the sky.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.879
I knew it had to be a shuttle.

16:50.922 --> 16:55.579
When you serve as yeoman
on the Enterprise,

16:55.623 --> 16:58.539
-you become an expert.
-Zac?

16:58.582 --> 17:00.454
You're alive. I-I thought...

17:00.497 --> 17:02.586
Does it ease your conscience?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.762
I-I'm just happy to see you.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.416
Are we meant to know
this person?

17:08.462 --> 17:09.984
He's a KIA from the report.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.640
Only I wasn't killed in action.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.468
-I was left behind.
-PIKE: Zac,

17:14.511 --> 17:15.904
they told me that you went down.

17:15.946 --> 17:18.037
But you never
saw it for yourself.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.213
-You didn't bother
to confirm it.
-Zac...

17:20.256 --> 17:22.084
It's High Lord Zacarias.

17:22.127 --> 17:24.478
That's what they call me here.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.696
You'll do the same.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.482
I'm a long way from yeoman.

17:28.525 --> 17:31.267
Arming your men with
phaser rifles probably helped.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.660
PIKE:
We're here now.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.357
We can fix
whatever mistakes we made.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.925
-It's a little late for that.
-PIKE: Zac.

17:36.968 --> 17:39.275
W-We saw your message,
the, um...

17:39.319 --> 17:40.755
the Delta in the garden.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.453
It's why we came.
Isn't that why you did it?

17:45.020 --> 17:48.197
The people here
adopted it as my symbol.

17:48.241 --> 17:50.504
I should have known better.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.158
It's all getting torn out
tomorrow.

17:52.201 --> 17:55.596
Look, I understand you're upset.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.251
It must have been hard surviving
here all on your own, but...

17:58.294 --> 18:00.427
[short chuckle]
you managed it.

18:00.470 --> 18:03.299
You have no idea.

18:03.343 --> 18:06.172
This isn't
a normal planet, Pike.

18:06.215 --> 18:10.350
Haven't you noticed
how hard it is to think?

18:10.393 --> 18:14.136
-The ringing in your ears.
-You felt that, too?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.573
ZACARIAS:
The radiation here
affects your brain.

18:16.617 --> 18:18.140
First the ringing.

18:18.184 --> 18:21.317
Lost time, fear.

18:21.361 --> 18:24.625
Then, finally,
the forgetting, and...

18:24.668 --> 18:26.105
you're a Kalar.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.497
PIKE:
Whatever you're going through,
we can help.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.500
-Come back to the ship.
-I armed the locals

18:30.544 --> 18:32.807
with Starfleet tech
and made myself king.

18:32.850 --> 18:36.767
-There's no going back for me.
-Zac, please listen to reason.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.378
Reason doesn't exist here.

18:38.421 --> 18:41.381
You'll learn that.
[grunts]

18:41.424 --> 18:43.426
Feels right...

18:43.470 --> 18:46.168
to watch you suffer like I did.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.346
Enterpriseis in orbit.
They'll be coming for us.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.044
By tomorrow,
no one will remember.

18:53.088 --> 18:54.742
Including you.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.787
-M'BENGA: Captain?
-What are you doing?

18:56.831 --> 18:58.093
Zac, what are you doing?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.268
Zac, you're making a mistake.

18:59.312 --> 19:02.576
Rigel VII changes people.

on you three.

-What happened?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.504
Where are we?

19:19.767 --> 19:22.422
This is a cage.
We were captured?

19:22.465 --> 19:24.293
My head.

19:24.337 --> 19:26.600
Ow. Mine, too.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.211
If we can find
the source of the-the...

19:29.255 --> 19:31.431
the radiation, it...

19:31.474 --> 19:34.260
Maybe that volcano, um...

19:34.303 --> 19:36.175
The steam vents...

19:37.611 --> 19:40.179
How long has she been out?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.183
[grunts]

19:44.226 --> 19:46.185
-Get away from me!
-[Pike groans] La'An.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.665
Who are you?

19:55.368 --> 19:58.240
-La'An.
-Is that my name?

19:58.284 --> 19:59.546
What's happening?

19:59.589 --> 20:02.549
Time loss. Fear.

20:02.592 --> 20:03.898
And then you forget.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.856
This is what
he was talking about.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.336
Who?

20:07.380 --> 20:10.209
The... the...

20:10.252 --> 20:12.254
Him. The, uh...

20:12.298 --> 20:14.561
H-He said...

20:14.604 --> 20:16.606
he said we would forget,

20:16.650 --> 20:18.565
uh...

20:18.608 --> 20:21.655
Can anyone tell me
what we're doing here?

20:23.526 --> 20:25.702
I don't know.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.053
I don't know.

-Situation report?

21:03.087 --> 21:05.089
I ordered that two hours ago.

Two hours ago?

21:09.355 --> 21:10.704
Really?

21:12.227 --> 21:14.708
This is what happens
when you stay up

21:14.751 --> 21:17.580
translating Tellarite sonnets
instead of getting shut-eye.

21:18.581 --> 21:19.713
Uh...

21:19.756 --> 21:22.933
A-A question, sir.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.370
Did I do it?

21:25.980 --> 21:27.503
Did I transmit the report?

21:28.852 --> 21:30.332
UNA:
Ensign Uhura,

21:30.376 --> 21:32.160
I want you to report
to sickbay immediately.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.512
Uh-huh. I-I agree with that.

21:36.556 --> 21:38.819
I'm feeling
a little disoriented.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.474
Maybe someone should make sure
she actually gets there.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.476
UNA:
You go. I'll take over.

21:43.519 --> 21:46.522

Are you sure?
What about the debris field?

21:46.566 --> 21:48.437
I flew the Enterprise
before you did, Lieutenant.

21:48.481 --> 21:50.178
Right.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.485
Report back on her condition
as soon as possible.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.313
Aye, Commander.

Come on, Nyota.
Let's get you sorted out.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.364
CHAPEL:
So, how are you
feeling, exactly?

22:02.408 --> 22:04.453
Uh, at first, there was this

22:04.497 --> 22:07.238
loud ringing sound.

22:07.282 --> 22:08.936
Now I have a headache.

22:08.979 --> 22:10.459
Does that mean something?

22:13.506 --> 22:17.292
Hey. It's gonna be okay.
Relax.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.512
So, does it mean something?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.731
I need to run a complete
neurological analysis.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.559
I've never seen
anything like this.

22:23.603 --> 22:26.257
Synaptic degradation in frontal,

22:26.301 --> 22:29.304
parietal and temporal lobes.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.915
That doesn't sound good.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.743
Hey, you rest.

22:33.787 --> 22:35.484
I'll run some more tests.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.101
Half an hour ago she was fine.

22:44.145 --> 22:46.277
Yeah, and now something's
blocking her neural pathways.

22:46.321 --> 22:49.411
Could be viral, bacterial,

22:49.455 --> 22:50.586
environmental exposure.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.196
She's been at her station
all day.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.285
Maybe a delayed reaction.
Hey,

22:54.329 --> 22:55.809
what did you have for breakfast?

22:55.852 --> 22:57.811
Uh...

22:57.854 --> 22:59.682
same thing I always have.

Oatmeal.

Drugs are working.

to Uhura,

-SPOCK: Bridge to sickbay.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.827
We have a medical emergency.

23:13.870 --> 23:15.698
Hi, Spock.
What's happening?

23:15.742 --> 23:17.744
I am getting reports
that six crew members

23:17.787 --> 23:20.660
in engineering are suffering
from acute memory loss.

23:20.703 --> 23:22.401
I am having them
come to you now.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.666
Definitely not the oatmeal.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.628
[woman coughs]

23:34.761 --> 23:36.980
[door opens]

23:38.808 --> 23:41.028
Move or starve.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.600
[groans]

23:47.643 --> 23:50.211
Wait. Wait!

23:52.039 --> 23:55.608
It's all right. They've...
they've had a rough forgetting.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.620
There is no totem here
to guide you.

24:07.663 --> 24:09.665
What totem?

24:09.709 --> 24:11.885
-Why are we in a cage?
-MAN: You must have wandered.

24:12.929 --> 24:15.976
These keep us safe at night.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.631
I can help you re-center,
but hurry.

24:18.674 --> 24:21.764
-They don't like to wait.
-I don't know you.

24:21.808 --> 24:23.636
I don't know any of you.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.725
Or maybe we've known each other
our whole lives.

24:26.900 --> 24:29.250
Look at your colors-- blue.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.774
That means you work
in the stone quarry, like me.

24:31.818 --> 24:34.124
-My colors are green.
-So you chop the wood.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.170
-Hurry up!
-Okay. All right.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.345
We're coming.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.086
-The three of you...
-Move.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.218
look at me.

24:41.262 --> 24:43.438
Be in the moment with me.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.222
Follow along.

24:53.274 --> 24:56.538
-How are you so calm?
-I'll show you later, my totem.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.845
I wake every morning to it.

24:58.888 --> 25:01.848
Right now,
just be in this moment.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.508
[grunts]

25:17.907 --> 25:20.954
I don't like
not knowing what's going on.

25:20.997 --> 25:22.303
I don't like being forced labor.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.087
Our work is a blessing.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.436
We have purpose.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.264
That's why we're here.

25:27.308 --> 25:28.788
Is that from your totem?

25:29.876 --> 25:32.269
It's how we all live.

25:32.313 --> 25:34.794
You had a hard forgetting
last night.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.535
Tonight your forgetting
will be easier.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.581
-I'll guide you, all of you.
-PIKE: Forgetting.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.583
Are... are you
talking about sleep?

25:41.627 --> 25:44.194
Sleep is what
the Kalar in the palace do.

25:44.238 --> 25:46.240
We have forgettings.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.895
Okay, listen...
whatever your name is,

25:48.938 --> 25:51.027
thank you for helping,

25:51.071 --> 25:52.289
but unless I get
some straight answers from you,

25:52.333 --> 25:53.508
I'm gonna take this hammer

25:53.552 --> 25:54.596
and get it
from those guards over there.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.120
Please don't.
You'll be hurt.

25:57.164 --> 26:00.297
We are the Kalar from the field.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.690
We look out for each other.

26:01.734 --> 26:05.433
Every night,
we have our forgetting.

26:05.476 --> 26:08.349
We don't lose
the deeply known things.

26:08.392 --> 26:10.525
Walking, talking,

26:10.569 --> 26:13.180
other things deep inside us.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.575
But the remembered things--

26:16.618 --> 26:19.099
who we are, where we live--

26:19.142 --> 26:21.057
those go away.

26:21.101 --> 26:23.016
Every night?

26:23.059 --> 26:24.887
How does society work?

26:26.193 --> 26:28.804
Well, the Kalar from the palace

26:28.848 --> 26:30.327
keep their memories.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.503
We have pictures and each other

26:32.547 --> 26:33.853
to help guide us.

26:33.896 --> 26:36.029
And...

26:36.072 --> 26:37.421
fruit of the gods.

26:38.553 --> 26:41.861
Its oils help
to create our symbols.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.645
It's how I know my name is Luq.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.388
I don't... I don't have any...

26:47.431 --> 26:49.825
No... no pictures.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.392
Me neither.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.220
And look, these are not hands

26:53.263 --> 26:55.657
that have seen work
in a stone quarry.

26:55.701 --> 26:57.267
Something's not right here.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.835
You aren't from the field.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.229
That's what keeps bothering me.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.839
We don't belong here.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.321
Do the palace Kalar
have pictures?

27:09.584 --> 27:10.846
Maybe that's where we came from.

27:10.890 --> 27:13.327
And, oh, look.
I have this.

27:13.370 --> 27:16.678
It, uh, it belongs to someone,

27:16.722 --> 27:19.638
but it's also mine, a gift.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.640
[sighs] There's something else.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.859
Yes, that's how it's done.

27:23.903 --> 27:26.427
Emotions can guide you
where memories can't.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.517
I-I feel like
he also came with us.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.825
We need to get back
to where we came from.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.654
You can chase that feeling and
never find the answer you seek.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.874
The totem says,
"Let go of before.

27:38.918 --> 27:40.180
Live in the moment."

27:40.223 --> 27:42.443
Hey! Back to work.

27:49.058 --> 27:50.886
There's only two guards now.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.063
LA'AN:
We could overtake them,
but it doesn't

27:54.107 --> 27:55.761
look like anyone else
wants to fight back.

27:55.804 --> 27:58.024
They've been conditioned.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.721
Maybe one day you fight,

27:59.765 --> 28:02.245
next day you forget why.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.422
You give up.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.947
Move! Faster.

28:15.650 --> 28:19.523
-He's in pain.
-Field Kalar don't talk back.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.482
[grunting]

28:35.278 --> 28:37.280
Look out!
[grunting]

28:55.603 --> 28:56.735
What have you done?

28:58.258 --> 28:59.825
Put pressure on the wound.

29:00.869 --> 29:02.218
You know to fix her.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.699
You must be a healer,
uh, a doctor.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.136
Yes, maybe.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.399
I believe I know
how to ease her pain.

29:09.443 --> 29:11.532
We can't stay.
We need to leave now.

29:11.575 --> 29:13.752
She's right.
More guards will come.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.799
We need to find a place
where we can hide,

29:17.843 --> 29:19.845
-stay out of the open.
-I don't even know where we are.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.629
I can help.
Follow me.

29:24.675 --> 29:27.809
Synaptic degradation is apparent
across all neural pathways.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.029
And this is affecting
our memory?

29:30.072 --> 29:32.335
Only explicit memory is lost.

29:32.379 --> 29:34.294
Information and-and facts.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.904
Implicit memory--

29:35.948 --> 29:37.819
-uh, procedures we learn
-[high-pitched ringing]

29:37.863 --> 29:41.344
and can recall
by instinct or emotion--

29:41.388 --> 29:43.869
those all remain intact.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.914
[ringing stops]

29:45.958 --> 29:47.786
Sorry.
Explain it again.

29:49.526 --> 29:52.834
I could treat a simple wound.
I've done it a thousand times.

29:52.878 --> 29:55.837
But I won't remember
that it's my job to do it.

29:55.881 --> 29:59.232
And I couldn't perform
any complicated procedures.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.321
Or surgery.

30:01.364 --> 30:02.888
That's what's happening.

30:02.931 --> 30:05.586
And a third of the crew
is already down.

30:05.629 --> 30:07.762
We are forgetting who we are.

30:09.851 --> 30:12.375
-What's this?
-All vital crew members
should carry

30:12.419 --> 30:15.509
their personal information file,
in case you forget.

30:15.552 --> 30:17.076
It's a Band-Aid.
It's not a solution.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.729
How long
before it gets everyone?

30:18.773 --> 30:20.122
There's no pattern,

30:20.166 --> 30:22.777
no common denominator
among patients.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.345
But the first symptom
is tinnitus,

30:25.388 --> 30:26.955
followed by an intense migraine.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.870
According to my calculations,
it will be less than an hour

30:28.914 --> 30:31.090
before we are unable
to cover all critical stations.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.092
Theories.
What's causing this?

30:33.135 --> 30:36.399
Best guess,
some kind of exotic radiation.

30:36.443 --> 30:38.401
It started when we arrived here.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.751
We were not in orbit this long
on our last visit.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.884
Logic suggests
Rigel VII is the source.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.539
We need to go.
But we can't...

30:45.582 --> 30:47.106
[ringing resumes]

30:47.149 --> 30:50.892
...leave them.
We c-can't leave the, um...

30:50.936 --> 30:51.980
Do you mean the landing party?

30:52.024 --> 30:54.417
-Yes.
-[ringing stops]

30:54.461 --> 30:57.725
Them and a cap...
and the Captain, and...

31:00.075 --> 31:01.947
-Damn it, I can't think.
-I need to get you to sickbay.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.862
I have no desire
to strand our landing party,

31:03.905 --> 31:05.602
but we must prioritize
the safety of our entire crew.

31:05.646 --> 31:06.821
May I alter course?

31:07.822 --> 31:08.997
Keep us close.

31:09.041 --> 31:10.651
If we have it this bad up here,

31:10.694 --> 31:13.132
who knows how
they're doing down there.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.832
Lieutenant, break orbit and set
a course for the debris field.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.226
That's a terrible idea.

31:20.269 --> 31:21.967
I believe radiation
from the planet's atmosphere

31:22.010 --> 31:23.577
is interfering
with the crew's memory.

31:23.620 --> 31:25.231
Many of the elements
in the debris field

31:25.274 --> 31:27.146
are a natural shield
against radioactive isotopes.

31:27.189 --> 31:28.495
They may protect us.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.976
Before or after
they pulverize us?

31:31.019 --> 31:33.326
Are you not able to safely
navigate through the field?

31:33.369 --> 31:34.718
Hey, now you're being offensive.

31:34.762 --> 31:36.590
-Then plot a course.
-[scoffs]

31:39.071 --> 31:41.290
In case of memory loss.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.205
Right.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.947
I fly the ship.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.689
[sighs] I fly the ship.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.310
LUQ:
The sign matches my symbol.

32:01.354 --> 32:04.923
This belongs to me.
This is my home.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.540
[La'An groans]

32:17.370 --> 32:18.937
Water. Water.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.503
Easy.

32:20.547 --> 32:21.852
Don't strain yourself.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.202
[La'An sighs]

32:24.594 --> 32:26.422
Her wound is deep.

32:26.466 --> 32:29.077
She won't last much longer
without treatment.

32:29.121 --> 32:31.558
I believe I can save her.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.864
But her injury is complex.

32:33.908 --> 32:36.215
I can't treat it by
guessing blindly with hunches.

32:36.258 --> 32:37.956
So you need your memories back.

32:37.999 --> 32:41.133
You need to let it go,
both of you.

32:41.176 --> 32:44.136
Allow her last moments
to be serene,

32:44.179 --> 32:45.920
not anxious and fearful.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.836
I'm not ready to have
my last moments yet, thank you.

32:48.879 --> 32:51.447
This woman--

32:51.491 --> 32:52.927
she's my friend.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.843
I can feel it now.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.976
I have to try.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.025
We can't just let her die.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.853
You are not seeing the point.

33:05.896 --> 33:09.161
The forgetting is a blessing.

33:09.204 --> 33:12.033
Things from the heart,
things that matter--

33:12.077 --> 33:14.035
they don't go away.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.385
But the details, the anguish--

33:16.429 --> 33:18.257
those will all fade.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.999
-That sounds like a nightmare.
-Why?

33:21.042 --> 33:23.088
Instead of feeling
the pain of her passing,

33:23.131 --> 33:24.524
we will be spared
the memory of it.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.700
Stop saying I'm going to die.

33:26.743 --> 33:28.789
Please calm down.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.052
She's running a fever.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.793
You keep talking about a totem

33:32.836 --> 33:34.403
that-that explains everything.

33:34.447 --> 33:36.449
-Where is it?
-You're standing
right next to it.

33:38.625 --> 33:40.844
The story of the Kalar.

33:40.888 --> 33:42.629
It greets us when we rise

33:42.672 --> 33:44.413
and helps make sense
of the world.

33:44.457 --> 33:46.850
What does it say
about the palace?

33:46.894 --> 33:48.852
The gods decided long ago
that there would be

33:48.896 --> 33:50.376
two types of Kalar.

33:50.419 --> 33:53.205
Those who remember
to plan our future

33:53.248 --> 33:55.033
and record our past, and...

33:55.076 --> 33:57.165
and those who forget

33:57.209 --> 33:58.993
to keep the work
of the present continuing.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.648
It's convenient that some do
all the work while others don't.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.345
That is not true.

34:03.389 --> 34:07.088
The palace Kalar remember
so the rest of us can be free.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.743
We have no past, no burdens.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.092
I'll take my burdens if it means

34:11.136 --> 34:12.789
-I can heal people.
-PIKE: Wh...

34:12.833 --> 34:15.313
How do the palace Kalar
hold on to their memories?

34:15.357 --> 34:19.187
I-I... I do not know
for certain.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.234
There's a legend that

34:22.277 --> 34:25.150
the palace Kalars' memories
are protected

34:25.193 --> 34:28.327
inside a casket
hidden in the palace.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.632
Yes, you said
we were from the palace.

34:30.677 --> 34:32.373
Must be, look--
we-we have no calluses.

34:32.418 --> 34:33.897
I said you were not
from the field.

34:33.940 --> 34:36.639

49:12.862 --> 49:15.648
I thought you would
wander around.

49:17.041 --> 49:20.435
Get lost among the field Kalar.

49:22.089 --> 49:24.178
It figures
you'd start a revolution.

49:24.222 --> 49:27.225
-[laughing]
-My friend is dying.

49:28.356 --> 49:30.663
It'll come back to you soon.

49:30.706 --> 49:33.187
You've been inside
the palace long enough.

49:34.145 --> 49:36.190

49:38.453 --> 49:39.759
Stop laughing.

49:41.543 --> 49:42.718

49:42.762 --> 49:45.895
You fell for that
lame totem story.

49:45.939 --> 49:47.506
[groans]

49:48.986 --> 49:50.422
I just want our memories.

49:53.686 --> 49:55.818
Your-your friend
is going to die.

49:55.862 --> 49:57.864
[continues laughing]

49:57.907 --> 49:58.996
Enough.

49:59.039 --> 50:00.780
No.

50:00.823 --> 50:02.434
Please don't kill me.
I take it back.

50:02.477 --> 50:03.783
[high-pitched ringing]

50:03.826 --> 50:05.698
I take it all back.

50:07.961 --> 50:09.745
[ringing stops]

50:17.101 --> 50:19.103
I'm not gonna kill you, Zac.

50:20.104 --> 50:22.802
You were about to.

50:22.845 --> 50:25.022
All over a fairy tale.

50:26.588 --> 50:28.547
I told you.
Rigel VII changes people.

50:28.590 --> 50:30.375
No.

50:30.418 --> 50:31.854
No, it doesn't.

50:33.639 --> 50:35.554
It shows us who we really are.

50:35.597 --> 50:37.904
I came here to save
my security officer.

50:37.947 --> 50:40.341
The lives of my crew
mean everything to me.

50:42.561 --> 50:44.867
When we left you before, I...

50:47.131 --> 50:49.002
I mourned you.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.395
Zac.

50:51.396 --> 50:54.007
I'm so sorry
you got left behind.

50:54.051 --> 50:56.749
But everything that came after--
that's your own doing.

50:56.792 --> 50:59.230
You cannot blame me for that.

51:00.405 --> 51:01.797
All right.

51:02.755 --> 51:04.191
So, now what?

51:04.235 --> 51:06.106
I'm bringing you home.

51:08.195 --> 51:10.241
Starfleet will decide the rest.

51:29.608 --> 51:31.000
He was right.

51:31.958 --> 51:34.613
Not having a past...

51:35.614 --> 51:37.572
...it can be nice for a while.

51:38.530 --> 51:40.488
I know what you mean.

51:42.621 --> 51:46.233
But maybe some memories
are worth the pain of others.

51:49.236 --> 51:51.717
It's good to be back.

51:52.935 --> 51:54.546
Yes, it is.

52:08.429 --> 52:11.432
-You decided to stay.
-[shudders]

52:14.000 --> 52:15.958
You got memories back.

52:16.002 --> 52:18.047
I had a family.

52:18.091 --> 52:19.440
A son.

52:21.050 --> 52:23.009
[chuckles softly]
A lot like you.

52:24.010 --> 52:25.359
[exhales, sniffles]

52:25.403 --> 52:28.014
Thank you for giving them
all back to me.

52:28.057 --> 52:30.625
I was wrong before.

52:30.669 --> 52:33.454
All field Kalar
should know about their past.

52:34.412 --> 52:36.631
The story of your life,

52:36.675 --> 52:38.155
the details...

52:39.808 --> 52:41.375
...they matter.

52:42.811 --> 52:43.943
So...

52:44.944 --> 52:47.251
...now you know
who gave you that.

52:48.252 --> 52:50.079
Who is it?

52:53.648 --> 52:56.129
Someone I need to apologize to.

52:58.566 --> 53:00.742
ORTEGAS:
Pilot's personal log,

53:00.786 --> 53:02.614
stardate 1632.2.

53:02.657 --> 53:04.964
As soon as we cleared
the debris field,

53:05.007 --> 53:06.835
our memories came back.

53:06.879 --> 53:09.708
Turns out those unknown elements
Spock found in the asteroids

53:09.751 --> 53:11.927
were causing all the problems.

53:11.971 --> 53:14.365
We went there to save ourselves

53:14.408 --> 53:16.628
but almost lost
theEnterprise instead.

53:16.671 --> 53:18.630
I don't blame Spock.

53:18.673 --> 53:20.458
He's still got a lot to learn.

53:20.501 --> 53:23.635
Plus, he made up for it
by devising a shield harmonic

53:23.678 --> 53:25.941
to protect us
from the radiation.

53:25.985 --> 53:28.770
As for the Kalar on Rigel VII,

53:28.814 --> 53:32.165
Captain Pike has a more
permanent solution in mind.

53:32.861 --> 53:35.081
Shuttles report
tractor locks stable.

53:37.039 --> 53:38.432
You are certain
this is not a violation

53:38.476 --> 53:40.260
of the Prime Directive, sir?

53:40.304 --> 53:43.785
A single asteroid changed the
course of history on this planet

53:43.829 --> 53:45.222
for thousands of years.

53:45.265 --> 53:47.267
That's not natural development.

53:47.311 --> 53:49.530
Your logic...

53:49.574 --> 53:51.053
feels sound to me.

53:53.099 --> 53:55.536
Ready for some
fancy flying, Erica?

53:57.059 --> 53:59.061
No one but you
could pull this off.

Oh, you know I've got this.

So you diverted two starships
for a routine prisoner transfer?

You know it's more than that.

54:36.882 --> 54:38.797
I read the report.

54:38.840 --> 54:40.451
Sounds like you had
a rough couple of days.

54:40.494 --> 54:42.279
Yeah, I did.

54:43.541 --> 54:45.107
But I learned something.

54:45.151 --> 54:47.109
About me.

54:47.153 --> 54:49.460
Uh, and about us.

54:50.939 --> 54:52.201
Us?

54:52.245 --> 54:54.073
I was wrong.

54:55.683 --> 54:57.294
You tried to tell me
and I couldn't see it.

54:57.337 --> 54:59.121
Instead I acted like an ass.

54:59.165 --> 55:00.819
Can I get that in writing?

55:00.862 --> 55:02.560
Whatever it takes.

55:02.603 --> 55:04.823
Oh, and you were right
about this, too.

55:06.477 --> 55:08.783
It brings lost sailors home.

55:11.090 --> 55:12.613
I don't know.

55:14.267 --> 55:16.965
You said it yourself--
it's not easy,

whatever this is between us.

55:19.533 --> 55:20.752
Was.

I know.

But...

55:27.106 --> 55:30.370
...there are only a handful
of people in the galaxy

55:30.414 --> 55:33.330
who get what it is
to be a Starfleet captain.

55:33.373 --> 55:36.245
Who aren't diminished by the
fact that our duties come first,

55:36.289 --> 55:37.769
our crews come first.

55:38.813 --> 55:40.293
That's a strength,
not a weakness.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.208
So where are you
gonna find another gal

who gets you like I do?

55:46.299 --> 55:48.388
You brought me home.

That's what happened
on Rigel VII.
