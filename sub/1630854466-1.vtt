-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

12:38.064 --> 12:40.460
(fetal heartbeat pulsing
over speakers)

12:41.496 --> 12:44.464
JODI:<i> Mary, thanks so much</i>
<i> for calling me back.</i>

12:44.499 --> 12:46.367
MARY (over phone):
Who have you talked to?

12:46.402 --> 12:49.568
I can't tell you names, just as
I would never divulge yours,

12:49.603 --> 12:52.109
but if you wanted to share
anything that you know,

12:52.144 --> 12:53.979
that would be so helpful.

12:54.014 --> 12:56.982
I don't think
people will want to talk.

12:57.017 --> 12:58.115
Sorry.

12:58.150 --> 12:59.479
(line clicks)

13:05.751 --> 13:07.421
(laughs)

13:07.456 --> 13:10.490
JODI:<i> Ms. Godrèche, thank you</i>
<i> so much for responding.</i>

13:10.525 --> 13:12.492
JUDITH:
<i> Before you continue,</i>

13:12.527 --> 13:14.560
<i> I've talked about Weinstein</i>
<i> in the past, but it's private.</i>

13:14.595 --> 13:17.728
<i> My immigration lawyer does not</i>
<i> want me to be involved.</i>

13:17.763 --> 13:19.499
(line clicks, beeps)

13:20.799 --> 13:22.535
Involved in what?

13:23.505 --> 13:26.044
(line ringing)

13:26.079 --> 13:29.344
-ROSE (over phone): Hello?
-Oh, hi, Rose.

13:29.379 --> 13:32.347
Um, this is Jodi Kantor
from<i> The New York Times.</i>

13:32.382 --> 13:34.382
I wrote you an email.

13:34.417 --> 13:36.681
Shaunna Thomas suggested
you might be willing to have

13:36.716 --> 13:38.892
a conversation with me
about Hollywood,

13:38.927 --> 13:41.290
and specifically
Harvey Weinstein.

13:41.325 --> 13:43.655
-Are you writing about him?
-Yes, I am.

13:43.690 --> 13:47.230
Look, I don't feel that inclined
to talk to you about it.

13:47.265 --> 13:48.495
JODI:
Could I ask why not?

13:48.530 --> 13:50.035
ROSE:
I've been treated quite shabbily

13:50.070 --> 13:52.334
by your paper numerous times,

13:52.369 --> 13:57.042
and I believe
the root of it is sexism.

13:57.077 --> 13:58.604
I'm sorry
that was your experience.

13:58.639 --> 14:02.212
I've talked in the past,
and nothing happened.

14:02.247 --> 14:03.840
I spoke at
a political meeting recently,

14:03.875 --> 14:08.086
and<i> The New York Times</i>
put it in the Style section.

14:08.121 --> 14:12.156
It does damage to shout,
and no one listens.

14:12.191 --> 14:15.456
I'm investigating
systemic sexism in Hollywood.

14:15.491 --> 14:17.524
How many pages have you got?

14:17.559 --> 14:18.822
No.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.791
I put myself on the line before,

14:20.826 --> 14:22.529
and it made no difference.

14:22.564 --> 14:25.664
I've written about the
workplace at Amazon, Starbucks

14:25.699 --> 14:29.767
and Harvard Business School,
and change did happen.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.274
They reformed their policies

14:31.309 --> 14:33.672
as a direct result
of the<i> Times</i> articles.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.180
But if you don't want to talk,
I understand.

14:36.215 --> 14:38.380
And good luck with your book.

14:38.415 --> 14:41.119
Thank you. Goodbye.

14:43.189 --> 14:45.849
RON:
I spoke to Dad.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.686
He sounded worse.

14:49.327 --> 14:51.855
I got to go see him soon.

14:51.890 --> 14:53.197
Could you go for a long weekend?

14:53.232 --> 14:55.430
You could take the girls.

14:55.465 --> 14:58.103
I could take Talia
but not both of them.

15:02.571 --> 15:03.801
(sighs)

15:03.836 --> 15:05.638
I'm having an affair.

15:07.048 --> 15:09.708
With a very famous actress.

15:10.711 --> 15:12.447
You want her number?

15:15.716 --> 15:17.452
(chuckles)

15:18.224 --> 15:21.324
-She's so hot.
-(laughs)

15:21.359 --> 15:23.293
This looks beautiful.

15:23.328 --> 15:26.263
-You'd really like her.
-(laughs)

15:26.298 --> 15:30.729
"I am a nasty woman.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.138
(crowd cheering)

15:33.173 --> 15:34.799
"I'm not as nasty

15:34.834 --> 15:38.638
as using little girls like
Pokémon before their bodies..."

15:38.673 --> 15:41.212
-Is that Ashley Judd?
-Yeah.

15:42.248 --> 15:44.083
She wrote about
being sexually harassed

15:44.118 --> 15:45.909
by a producer in the '90s.

15:45.944 --> 15:49.781
She doesn't name him,
but she describes him as

15:49.816 --> 15:53.686
"one of our industry's most
famous admired/reviled bosses."

15:53.721 --> 15:55.193
Mm.

15:55.228 --> 15:57.954
"...sexual assault, transphobia,

15:57.989 --> 16:00.759
"white supremacy, misogyny,

16:00.794 --> 16:03.135
-ignorance, white privilege."
-(Violet crying in distance)

16:03.170 --> 16:05.137
-I'll go.
-I'll get her.

16:05.172 --> 16:08.338
-TALIA: Mom!
-(chuckles)

16:08.373 --> 16:10.604
-We'll both go.
-Yeah.

16:11.772 --> 16:14.212
(voice breaking):
I don't know if I can do this.

16:14.247 --> 16:15.642
(sobs softly)

16:16.909 --> 16:18.645
VADIM:
You need to rest.

16:19.417 --> 16:22.418
You try to sleep, maybe?

16:23.223 --> 16:25.685
I don't want to be... (sighs)

16:26.985 --> 16:29.623
I just have
this constant sense of dread.

16:29.658 --> 16:30.921
(sobs)

16:30.956 --> 16:32.890
You're tired.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.991
Your body's exhausted.

16:35.026 --> 16:36.795
(Megan sighs)

16:36.830 --> 16:39.699
I think I would know
if it was just that.

16:39.734 --> 16:42.273
(sighs)

16:44.970 --> 16:46.871
-(phone vibrating)
-Mom.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.221
Hello?

16:56.256 --> 16:58.047
ROSE (over phone):
It's Rose.

16:58.082 --> 17:00.588
-McGowan.
-Rose, hi.

17:00.623 --> 17:03.360
It's not just him
you should be after.

17:03.395 --> 17:06.429
There's an entire machine,
a supply chain.

17:06.464 --> 17:08.959
Of abusers in Hollywood?

17:08.994 --> 17:10.026
Right.

17:10.061 --> 17:11.533
They're worldwide,

17:11.568 --> 17:15.339
wherever movies are
being made or sold.

17:15.374 --> 17:18.177
Each studio does
the victim-shaming and payouts.

17:18.212 --> 17:22.445
If white men could have
a playground, this would be it.

17:24.482 --> 17:26.845
Do people know about it?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.517
Of course.

17:28.552 --> 17:32.081
I told a lot of people
what happened to me.

17:32.116 --> 17:34.358
At the Sundance Film Festival?

17:34.393 --> 17:38.560
I was 23. I was doing all these
brilliant independent films.

17:38.595 --> 17:40.991
I was just incredibly hopeful.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.300
(door opens)

17:42.335 --> 17:44.027
-And then I went
to that hotel room. -Hi.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.798
(whispering)

17:45.833 --> 17:46.997
(door closes)

17:47.032 --> 17:48.768
RON:
Talia?

17:48.803 --> 17:50.275
-I'm here.
-(door closes)

17:50.310 --> 17:52.673
ROSE:
He was on a sofa,

17:52.708 --> 17:55.280
talking loudly on his phone.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.644
I waited.

17:56.679 --> 17:58.745
And then
we talked about projects,

17:58.780 --> 18:04.685
and he suddenly said,
"I have a Jacuzzi in my room."

18:04.720 --> 18:07.160
I didn't know
what the answer to that was,

18:07.195 --> 18:09.921
so I just kept talking.

18:11.463 --> 18:14.024
We wrapped up,
and he said he'd walk me out,

18:14.059 --> 18:17.434
and I thought,
"Well, that went well."

18:17.469 --> 18:19.997
It was my first big meeting.

18:20.032 --> 18:24.001
He walked behind me
down a hallway, then he said,

18:24.036 --> 18:26.641
"This is the Jacuzzi room."

18:26.676 --> 18:31.415
And I looked in,
and he pushed me inside.

18:31.450 --> 18:37.619
He stripped me,
and he was suddenly naked.

18:37.654 --> 18:40.754
I left my body in some way.

18:41.856 --> 18:43.757
And he raped me.

18:44.694 --> 18:50.236
I went into survival mode to
get out, and I faked an orgasm.

18:50.271 --> 18:52.667
He told me to get dressed.

18:52.702 --> 18:56.099
He left me messages telling me
I was his new special friend

18:56.134 --> 19:00.136
and that he'd done a lot
for other actresses.

19:00.171 --> 19:02.006
Did you report it?

19:02.041 --> 19:05.449
Can you see the law
taking my side on that?

19:08.146 --> 19:10.113
But you told other people?

19:10.148 --> 19:14.150
I told a lot of people,
and nobody did a thing.

19:14.185 --> 19:15.855
Nothing.

19:17.826 --> 19:21.157
Can I contact
the people you told?

19:21.192 --> 19:23.401
You told me this was private.

19:24.470 --> 19:28.406
He'll have spies
watching you now, as we speak.

19:28.441 --> 19:30.672
I hope you know that.

this is Jodi Kantor.

19:59.670 --> 20:01.505
Is this a bad time?

20:01.540 --> 20:03.573
Uh... um, no.

-It's fine.

Oh, I hear her.

20:06.974 --> 20:09.447
How's it all going?

20:09.482 --> 20:12.109
Yeah, it's, um...

20:12.144 --> 20:14.353
I just got her down.

20:15.653 --> 20:18.247
JODI: It's the toughest part,
I think.

20:18.282 --> 20:19.589
MEGAN:
Is it?

20:19.624 --> 20:21.789
JODI:
I found it to be so.

20:21.824 --> 20:25.562
With my first daughter,
I had postpartum depression.

20:27.401 --> 20:29.368
Everyone's so excited,

20:29.403 --> 20:32.063
and it's like...

20:32.098 --> 20:33.636
you're just not there.

20:35.101 --> 20:36.672
MEGAN:
Right.

20:37.939 --> 20:38.740
(sighs)

20:38.775 --> 20:41.204
So, I got your email.

20:41.239 --> 20:42.414
How's it all going?

20:42.449 --> 20:44.779
Yeah. (laughs)

20:44.814 --> 20:49.586
I feel like there are
a lot of women who have...

20:49.621 --> 20:52.523
been through something with him.

20:53.427 --> 20:56.252
But they find it hard to talk.

20:56.287 --> 21:01.400
And those who do talk to me
don't want to go on the record.

21:01.435 --> 21:03.765
In your previous stories,

21:03.800 --> 21:05.767
how did you persuade women
to tell you

21:05.802 --> 21:07.571
what had happened to them?

21:09.377 --> 21:12.136
Yeah, so...

21:12.171 --> 21:13.610
It's difficult.

21:13.645 --> 21:16.140
They're terrified.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.175
A case I made was,

21:18.210 --> 21:22.421
"You know, I can't change what
happened to you in the past,

21:22.456 --> 21:26.249
"but together we may be able
to use your experience

21:26.284 --> 21:29.153
to help protect other people."

21:29.188 --> 21:32.255
The truth, basically.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.630
But yeah.

21:33.665 --> 21:37.832
It's hard to ask women to talk.

ASHLEY JUDD:
Then he asked me to meet him,

21:58.151 --> 21:59.755
uh, really early.

21:59.790 --> 22:03.352
And I had been up all night
filming, and I was tired.

22:03.387 --> 22:06.795
I went over to The Peninsula
Hotel, and at reception,

22:06.830 --> 22:09.325
I asked, "Is Mr. Weinstein
in The Belvedere restaurant

22:09.360 --> 22:10.667
or is he on the patio?"

22:10.702 --> 22:14.539
And they said, "Go to his room."

22:14.574 --> 22:17.542
(over laptop):
And I went upstairs,

22:17.577 --> 22:20.875
and Harvey was in his bathrobe.

22:20.910 --> 22:24.274
And he asked if
he could give me a massage.

22:24.309 --> 22:27.310
"No," I said.

22:27.345 --> 22:29.147
And then, um, he asked me

22:29.182 --> 22:31.281
to help him pick out
his clothes for the day.

22:31.316 --> 22:35.725
He, you know, started asking
for all these things,

22:35.760 --> 22:38.827
increasingly more sexual,
getting closer and closer.

22:38.862 --> 22:41.962
And I just said no
so many different times

22:41.997 --> 22:44.668
and in so many different ways.

22:44.703 --> 22:49.332
And then he finally, um, asked
me to watch him take a shower.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.170
And I said, "Harvey,

22:52.205 --> 22:56.845
"when I win an Academy Award
in a Miramax movie,

22:56.880 --> 22:58.748
I will give you a blow job."

22:58.783 --> 23:01.278
And I got out of there fast.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.752
What did you do?

23:02.787 --> 23:05.315
I told my dad, I told my agent,

23:05.350 --> 23:08.186
I told the people with whom
I was filming that night,

23:08.221 --> 23:09.792
and Harvey punished me.

23:09.827 --> 23:12.058
I mean, he blackballed my career

23:12.093 --> 23:14.357
because I had the wherewithal
to refuse him.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.831
How do you know that?

23:15.866 --> 23:17.503
I would be standing
with other actresses,

23:17.538 --> 23:18.768
and he would blank me.

23:18.803 --> 23:20.902
There were roles
for which I was up

23:20.937 --> 23:22.607
that I mysteriously did not get,

23:22.642 --> 23:25.236
and I know today that it was
Harvey making a phone call.

23:25.271 --> 23:29.438
You know I did an article about
it, and nobody did anything.

23:29.473 --> 23:32.716
You didn't identify him,
but did industry people know

23:32.751 --> 23:34.619
who you were talking about
in your article?

23:34.654 --> 23:36.148
Absolutely.

23:36.183 --> 23:39.316
And the abuse came raining down
on me, not on him.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.592
You know at the Women's March

23:40.627 --> 23:42.319
when I did
the "Nasty Woman" poem?

23:42.354 --> 23:45.223
I lost a huge advertising gig
because a small group of people

23:45.258 --> 23:48.226
complained that I was
quoting the president.

23:48.261 --> 23:50.767
He used that language
and got elected.

23:50.802 --> 23:53.572
I quoted him, and I got fired.

23:53.607 --> 23:56.839
It is decades later,
and it's still the same sexism.

23:56.874 --> 24:00.337
And, Jodi, I would make
the same choices all over again,

24:00.372 --> 24:02.779
but I also would like to work.

24:06.081 --> 24:08.686
JODI:<i> Lisa Bloom, the lawyer,</i>
<i> she wrote to me.</i>

24:08.721 --> 24:10.413
-Gloria Allred's daughter?
-Yeah.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.953
-Do you know her?
-No.

24:16.828 --> 24:18.157

Yeah.
This is straight from legal.

"My book,<i> Suspicion Nation,</i>
is being produced

24:28.774 --> 24:31.467

24:31.502 --> 24:34.074

daughter of feminist icon,

Harvey Weinstein.

24:39.114 --> 24:40.949

for a miniseries?

Lisa reaching out to you.

is just, like:

26:41.302 --> 26:43.599
Is this the best use
of our time?

26:43.634 --> 26:45.007
Like, as opposed to

26:45.042 --> 26:47.845
other people we could
potentially be covering.

26:47.880 --> 26:51.376
People who can't speak out.
Actresses already have a voice.

26:51.411 --> 26:53.345
But they could also fear
being punished

26:53.380 --> 26:55.446

for using it.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.690

26:57.725 --> 27:01.188
But what is it exactly
that we're looking at here?

27:01.223 --> 27:04.895
We're looking at extreme sexual
harassment in the workplace.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.590
These young women walked into

27:07.625 --> 27:09.768
what they all had reason to
believe were business meetings

27:09.803 --> 27:11.660
with a producer, an employer.

27:11.695 --> 27:13.365
They were hopeful.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.565
They were expecting a serious
conversation about their work

27:15.600 --> 27:17.237
or a possible project.

27:17.272 --> 27:21.043
Instead, they say he met them
with threats and sexual demands.

27:21.078 --> 27:23.606
They claim assault and rape.

27:23.641 --> 27:25.982
If that can happen
to Hollywood actresses,

27:26.017 --> 27:28.248
who else is it happening to?

27:29.251 --> 27:31.482
Do you think his employees
were targeted, too?

27:31.517 --> 27:33.957
I do.

27:36.225 --> 27:40.656
I could search for any police
complaints against Miramax.

27:40.691 --> 27:43.197
Or court records.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.562
Should I?

27:46.565 --> 27:48.268
Yes.

27:48.303 --> 27:49.874
MEGAN:
I found records of a complaint

27:49.909 --> 27:52.272
against Miramax from 2001,

27:52.307 --> 27:55.605
but the report was closed out
the same day it was made.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.278
It says, "complainant elected
court action,"

27:58.313 --> 28:00.214
but then
no court documents exist,

28:00.249 --> 28:01.919
which seems inconsistent.

28:01.954 --> 28:04.823
Do you have
any more information on that?

28:04.858 --> 28:06.088
WOMAN (over phone):
No, those records

28:06.123 --> 28:08.486
would have been destroyed.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.894
Really? Why?

28:09.929 --> 28:11.456
It's agency policy.

28:11.491 --> 28:14.800
All records are destroyed
after three years.

28:14.835 --> 28:16.626
Why is that?

28:16.661 --> 28:19.970
As I said, it's policy.

28:20.841 --> 28:22.302
So could you please tell me

28:22.337 --> 28:25.338

sexual harassment complaint?

28:25.373 --> 28:27.945
No, I cannot.

28:27.980 --> 28:30.541
-Because?
-It's policy.

28:30.576 --> 28:33.885
We are prohibited
from giving you that name.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.547
Is that everything?

28:36.582 --> 28:38.351
This is very important.

28:38.386 --> 28:41.519
It's about someone who's still
very powerful in the workplace.

28:41.554 --> 28:44.159
Who could still be
harassing someone.

28:44.194 --> 28:46.865
Is there any way
you can help me?

28:50.332 --> 28:52.871
You could ask me the name
of the government investigator

28:52.906 --> 28:54.807
who was assigned the case.

28:54.842 --> 28:57.403
I could give you
that information.

28:57.438 --> 28:59.537
-Just a name.
-Thank you.

29:01.244 --> 29:04.509
MEGAN: I've made 20 calls
to track this investigator.

he was kind of naughty.

in Venice at the film festival.

48:57.175 --> 48:59.868
It was '98.

48:59.903 --> 49:01.573
What happened?

49:03.181 --> 49:05.148
(sighs softly)

49:05.183 --> 49:08.976
What makes me most angry
is the silence.

49:09.011 --> 49:13.486
No one spoke out then, and
no one is talking about it now.

49:13.521 --> 49:16.588
He built the silence,
and people complied.

49:16.623 --> 49:19.558
He produced fear
and intimidation.

49:19.593 --> 49:21.626
The only alternative,
seemingly, was to quit

49:21.661 --> 49:24.596
and throw away everything
you worked so hard for

49:24.631 --> 49:25.927
out the door.

49:25.962 --> 49:27.962
You were terrified you were
gonna be the next target,

49:27.997 --> 49:29.766
so people looked the other way.

49:29.801 --> 49:33.044
-Within the company?
-Yes, and outside of it.

49:33.079 --> 49:36.080
I mean, he played the press.
He played the agents.

49:36.115 --> 49:37.708
How did he play the press?

49:37.743 --> 49:39.644
By promising them
access to stars

49:39.679 --> 49:41.811
in exchange for
hushing up some incident.

49:41.846 --> 49:43.714
What sort of incident?

49:44.552 --> 49:46.816
(chuckles) Where do I start?

49:46.851 --> 49:49.753
Harvey had this--
what did they call it?--

49:49.788 --> 49:55.396
"a physical altercation" with a
male employee at a conference.

49:55.431 --> 49:57.024
Then they settled with the guy.

49:57.059 --> 49:59.268
And with women?

50:00.667 --> 50:02.634
He pursued them.

50:02.669 --> 50:04.399
Endlessly.

50:07.476 --> 50:09.674
What happened in Venice?

50:11.612 --> 50:13.579
I don't want to be quoted.

50:13.614 --> 50:14.382
Period.

50:14.417 --> 50:16.549
Understood.

50:20.489 --> 50:21.983
We were in Harvey's suite,

50:22.018 --> 50:24.821
and (sniffles) there were
a bunch of people in there.

50:24.856 --> 50:27.395
And there were
these two assistants,

50:27.430 --> 50:30.266
and they were
sitting there trembling.

50:30.301 --> 50:32.059
And Weinstein was there?

50:32.094 --> 50:34.204
Yes.

50:34.239 --> 50:37.669
He was talking film
and ignoring them,

50:37.704 --> 50:40.606
but they were
literally vibrating.

50:40.641 --> 50:44.280
One with fear,
the other with anger.

50:46.515 --> 50:48.284
Can you tell me their names?

50:48.319 --> 50:50.319
Yes.

50:55.161 --> 50:59.020
And there's another woman
you should, you should call.

50:59.055 --> 51:02.562
The two assistants are
Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkins,

51:02.597 --> 51:05.697
and we have a third name,
Laura Madden.

51:05.732 --> 51:08.436
And none of them
are returning our calls.

51:08.471 --> 51:10.339
So? Show up in person.

51:10.374 --> 51:12.737
Yeah. (chuckles)

51:12.772 --> 51:17.104
They live in London,
Silicon Valley and Wales.

51:17.139 --> 51:19.414

51:21.814 --> 51:23.946

We're researching a story

53:09.922 --> 53:11.394
Sure.

53:11.429 --> 53:14.463
So, I've been speaking
with people

53:14.498 --> 53:17.829
who worked for Harvey Weinstein.

53:17.864 --> 53:21.668
You're going quite far back
with Rowena's time there.

53:21.703 --> 53:23.703
We're writing about
his treatment of women.

53:23.738 --> 53:25.034
Right.

53:25.069 --> 53:28.169
And Rowena fits in how?

53:28.974 --> 53:32.382
Your wife worked at Miramax
for some years.

53:32.417 --> 53:34.615
Yes.

53:34.650 --> 53:35.946
Mainly in Hong Kong.

53:35.981 --> 53:37.750
Like to hear about
her experiences

53:37.785 --> 53:39.290
working for Weinstein.

53:39.325 --> 53:42.458
I'm confused why you can't
discuss it on the phone.

53:42.493 --> 53:44.955
(laughs) I did try.

53:44.990 --> 53:47.364
It is always better
to actually meet.

53:49.258 --> 53:50.994
So...

53:52.701 --> 53:55.834
And this is off the record.

53:55.869 --> 53:57.935
My understanding is that...
(stammers)

53:57.970 --> 53:59.871
that Weinstein
possibly victimized your wife

53:59.906 --> 54:02.137
when Rowena
first worked for him.

54:05.582 --> 54:09.386
Rowena's never mentioned
anything like that to me.

54:09.421 --> 54:11.212
What-what do you mean
by "victimized"?

54:11.247 --> 54:12.719
Can you be more specific?

54:14.118 --> 54:15.623
I was told that your wife

54:15.658 --> 54:18.120
may have received a settlement
from Weinstein.

54:18.925 --> 54:22.399
(scoffs) Do I look like a guy
whose wife got a settlement?

54:23.732 --> 54:26.128
Could you have confused her
with someone else?

54:26.163 --> 54:29.197
I-I... I apologize
for taking up your time.

54:29.232 --> 54:30.572

54:30.607 --> 54:33.872

give this to Rowena?

54:33.907 --> 54:35.412
If you're talking
to these other people,

54:35.447 --> 54:36.809
why do you need
to talk to Rowena?

54:36.844 --> 54:39.878
And if you turn up
in my driveway,

54:39.913 --> 54:41.616
what kind of victimization?

54:41.651 --> 54:43.354
It's complex.

54:43.389 --> 54:45.620
I'm asking you to expand on it.

54:45.655 --> 54:49.723
I really think
it would be best...

54:50.594 --> 54:52.495

What if London is
a repeat of this?

55:13.309 --> 55:14.748
It won't be.

55:14.783 --> 55:16.981
I spoke with an
employment lawyer in the U.K.,

55:17.016 --> 55:20.589
and he told me that
it was irresponsible of me

55:20.624 --> 55:22.624
even to ask about
breaching NDAs.

55:22.659 --> 55:24.318
No one does it.
They would get sued.

Script meetings, discussions

59:06.476 --> 59:07.915
Like?

59:07.950 --> 59:10.511
For instance,
I would have to go to his hotel

59:10.546 --> 59:12.656
and wake Harvey up.

59:12.691 --> 59:14.383
Run his shower for him.

Get him out of bed.

59:15.859 --> 59:17.353

59:21.326 --> 59:22.831

59:22.866 --> 59:25.900
I found humor or aggression
worked best.

59:25.935 --> 59:29.772
Harvey was either

You never knew
which it would be.

59:32.711 --> 59:35.712
Did anyone on the team
give you advice about him?

59:35.747 --> 59:37.274
Yes. (chuckles)

Once, one girl told me to
always wear my puffer jacket,

1:01:06.497 --> 1:01:08.332
-But that night...
-She called you.

1:01:08.367 --> 1:01:09.333
No.

1:01:09.368 --> 1:01:10.202
(knock on door)

1:01:10.237 --> 1:01:11.566
<i> The following morning,</i>

1:01:11.601 --> 1:01:14.943
<i> she came to me,</i>
<i> and she was sobbing.</i>

1:01:14.978 --> 1:01:16.747
<i> -I mean, she was hysterical.</i>
-(sobbing)

1:01:16.782 --> 1:01:18.408
Rowena, what happened?

1:01:18.443 --> 1:01:20.146
Sit.

1:01:20.181 --> 1:01:22.918
<i> -And I held her.</i>
-What is it?

1:01:23.712 --> 1:01:26.548
Did she tell you what he did?

1:01:27.826 --> 1:01:29.683
Not exactly.

1:01:29.718 --> 1:01:31.487
Only that no one must know.

1:01:31.522 --> 1:01:32.994
But I knew.

1:01:33.029 --> 1:01:35.260
I knew that he must've...

1:01:36.868 --> 1:01:38.098
What?

1:01:38.133 --> 1:01:40.100
She was so upset.

1:01:40.135 --> 1:01:44.434
I knew that it had to be
the-the worst possible thing.

1:01:45.470 --> 1:01:48.537
I calmed her down, and I went
straight to confront Harvey.

1:01:48.572 --> 1:01:51.639
He was in a meeting, uh,
with Scorsese, who, you know...

1:01:51.674 --> 1:01:54.785
who hated him, so it was
a really big deal for Harvey.

1:01:54.820 --> 1:01:58.514
And I went straight up to him,
and I said very clearly,

1:01:58.549 --> 1:02:00.252
"You need to come with me
right now."

1:02:00.287 --> 1:02:02.859
You went right up to them
and confronted him?

1:02:02.894 --> 1:02:05.092
Yeah. I was so angry.

1:02:05.127 --> 1:02:07.490
And in front of everyone,

1:02:07.525 --> 1:02:10.658
he stood up and...

1:02:10.693 --> 1:02:12.902
he followed me like a lamb.

1:02:14.037 --> 1:02:17.698
And then I knew.
Then I knew he did it.

1:02:17.733 --> 1:02:19.436
And then?

1:02:19.471 --> 1:02:20.668
He denied it.

1:02:20.703 --> 1:02:22.241
He said, "I swear on my wife
and kids' lives

1:02:22.276 --> 1:02:23.638
that I did not assault
that young woman."

1:02:23.673 --> 1:02:26.773
(chuckles) And then
I knew that he was lying.

1:02:26.808 --> 1:02:28.181
He always used that line

1:02:28.216 --> 1:02:30.447
as a "get out of jail free"
card. Always.

1:02:31.252 --> 1:02:34.891
Did the assistant
report it to the police?

1:02:34.926 --> 1:02:38.092
Mm. She told no one.

1:02:39.865 --> 1:02:41.755
We came back to London.

1:02:41.790 --> 1:02:42.998
We both resigned.

1:02:43.033 --> 1:02:44.527
I told my direct superior,

1:02:44.562 --> 1:02:48.872
who suggested
we get ourselves a good lawyer.

1:02:48.907 --> 1:02:50.599
I had no idea where to get one.

1:02:50.634 --> 1:02:52.601
I found a company
close to the office,

1:02:52.636 --> 1:02:55.142
and-and then I thought
it would be simple.

1:02:55.177 --> 1:02:56.440
Criminal proceedings.

1:02:56.475 --> 1:02:58.640
But our lawyer said
we had no chance

1:02:58.675 --> 1:03:00.851
and the only thing to do
was to agree to a settlement.

1:03:00.886 --> 1:03:02.215
And I said categorically no,

1:03:02.250 --> 1:03:03.953
that no money
should change hands

1:03:03.988 --> 1:03:05.383
and that we just wanted
to stop him.

1:03:05.418 --> 1:03:08.023
And no U.K. police
were involved?

1:03:08.058 --> 1:03:09.585
We had no case.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:11.785
We had no evidence and
no police report from Venice.

1:03:11.820 --> 1:03:13.292
And, you see, with rape,

1:03:13.327 --> 1:03:15.030
it is impossibly difficult
to get a prosecution.

1:03:15.065 --> 1:03:16.559
And the lawyers kept saying

1:03:16.594 --> 1:03:19.166
damage limitation
was the only way to go.

1:03:19.201 --> 1:03:21.399
So I said, "All right, then.

1:03:21.434 --> 1:03:23.104
We have our own
very real demands."

1:03:23.139 --> 1:03:25.040
Conditions that Harvey
would have to meet

1:03:25.075 --> 1:03:26.206
if we were to sign.

1:03:26.241 --> 1:03:27.768
And what were those conditions?

1:03:27.803 --> 1:03:30.342
We demanded that if Harvey
had another settlement

1:03:30.377 --> 1:03:32.707
within two years, that it had
to be reported to Disney

1:03:32.742 --> 1:03:34.082
or else he would be fired.

1:03:34.117 --> 1:03:36.777
Another was that
he would go to therapy,

1:03:36.812 --> 1:03:38.152
with me present initially

1:03:38.187 --> 1:03:40.154
so that he couldn't lie
to the therapist.

1:03:40.189 --> 1:03:42.959
We demanded that
HR would put in a system

1:03:42.994 --> 1:03:45.324
to protect the women and staff.

1:03:45.359 --> 1:03:48.195
And it felt like if we could
achieve all of those,

1:03:48.230 --> 1:03:50.197
then that's what our silence
was paying for,

1:03:50.232 --> 1:03:53.266
that we were paying
for him to stop.

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:56.500
So we signed.

1:03:56.535 --> 1:03:59.635
And they had their own
insane conditions for us.

1:03:59.670 --> 1:04:01.307
What were they?

1:04:02.211 --> 1:04:03.672
I tried to commit them
to memory.

1:04:03.707 --> 1:04:05.674
Um, they wouldn't give us
our own copy.

1:04:05.709 --> 1:04:07.313
What?

1:04:07.348 --> 1:04:09.282
I was only given visitation
rights to my own settlement.

1:04:09.317 --> 1:04:11.779
That's in... (stammers)

1:04:11.814 --> 1:04:13.187
That's incredible.

1:04:13.222 --> 1:04:15.453
But you memorized them?

1:04:16.588 --> 1:04:22.262
I asked for letters, too, which
stated some of the conditions.

1:04:22.297 --> 1:04:25.826
One said,
"We will make best endeavors

1:04:25.861 --> 1:04:29.698
to not help the police
in a criminal or civil case."

1:04:29.733 --> 1:04:34.571
We weren't allowed to talk
to our family or a doctor.

1:04:36.377 --> 1:04:39.081
So finally we signed.

1:04:39.116 --> 1:04:41.908
They gave us some money.

1:04:41.943 --> 1:04:44.614
And I felt completely broken.

1:11:04.798 --> 1:11:07.293
and I got a job
as a runner on that.

1:11:07.328 --> 1:11:09.966
I was ecstatic. It was great.

1:11:10.771 --> 1:11:14.476
And you met
Harvey Weinstein when?

1:11:14.511 --> 1:11:16.038
Soon after that.

1:11:16.073 --> 1:11:18.810
I was going to be
working directly for him.

1:11:18.845 --> 1:11:21.945
Doing errands, answering calls.

1:11:21.980 --> 1:11:24.915
I was very happy to be asked.

1:11:26.688 --> 1:11:28.215
<i> He was charming.</i>

1:11:28.250 --> 1:11:32.087
<i> He was saying</i>
<i> he'd heard how hard I worked.</i>

1:11:32.122 --> 1:11:35.024
<i> And I was just excited.</i>

1:11:35.796 --> 1:11:40.293
<i> I was 21, you know,</i>
<i> very young but incredibly keen.</i>

1:11:41.406 --> 1:11:43.835
<i> So when he said</i>
<i> he'd give me a permanent job</i>

1:11:43.870 --> 1:11:47.971
<i> at the London office,</i>
<i> I felt so happy.</i>

1:11:48.006 --> 1:11:50.171
JODI:
<i> He said that in the meeting?</i>

1:11:50.206 --> 1:11:51.579
LAURA:
<i> Yes.</i>

1:11:51.614 --> 1:11:54.879
He was in his bathrobe
when he opened the door,

1:11:54.914 --> 1:11:59.620
but I thought
that was maybe very Hollywood.

1:11:59.655 --> 1:12:02.392
But quite soon into talking,

1:12:02.427 --> 1:12:05.087
he said,
would I give him a massage?

1:12:07.432 --> 1:12:09.432
I-I said no.

1:12:09.467 --> 1:12:10.763
He was very matter-of-fact.

1:12:10.798 --> 1:12:13.194
He said it's not
a romantic request.

1:12:13.229 --> 1:12:15.603
Everyone does it for him.

1:12:15.638 --> 1:12:17.704
It's part of the job.

1:12:20.005 --> 1:12:25.008
So, I suddenly thought that
I was the problem, you know.

1:12:25.043 --> 1:12:28.715
That I was the one
who was sexualizing it.

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:32.213
That I was just
young and uptight.

1:12:32.248 --> 1:12:33.819
So, I...

1:12:34.789 --> 1:12:36.888
...I put my hands
on his shoulders,

1:12:36.923 --> 1:12:41.827
but I couldn't actually
move them at all over his body.

1:12:41.862 --> 1:12:44.291
I just stood there.

1:12:44.326 --> 1:12:46.161
My hands wouldn't move.

1:12:46.196 --> 1:12:51.573
And then he said he would
give me a massage first.

1:12:51.608 --> 1:12:53.740
To relax me.

1:12:55.975 --> 1:13:00.142
And he said,
"Look, all the girls do it.

1:13:00.177 --> 1:13:02.650
It's just work."

1:13:02.685 --> 1:13:05.455
And then he said,
"Take your top off."

1:13:05.490 --> 1:13:07.853
Very matter-of-fact.

1:13:07.888 --> 1:13:10.119
"Take your bra off."

1:13:14.730 --> 1:13:17.599
And I did.

1:13:17.634 --> 1:13:21.735
I was terrified,
but I just thought,

1:13:21.770 --> 1:13:24.837
"Get through it. Do it."

1:13:26.610 --> 1:13:28.676
<i> And then my trousers were off,</i>

1:13:28.711 --> 1:13:32.812
<i> and he was standing over me...</i>

1:13:32.847 --> 1:13:35.375
<i> masturbating.</i>

1:13:35.410 --> 1:13:39.082
<i> I asked him to leave me alone,</i>

1:13:39.117 --> 1:13:42.217
<i> but he kept asking</i>
<i> for different things.</i>

1:13:42.252 --> 1:13:45.891
<i> And then he suggested a shower,</i>
<i> and I got up.</i>

1:13:46.696 --> 1:13:50.225
<i> And he carried on...</i>

1:13:50.260 --> 1:13:52.359
<i> masturbating.</i>

1:13:52.394 --> 1:13:54.394
<i> And I kept crying.</i>

1:13:54.429 --> 1:13:57.397
<i> And I was sobbing,</i>
<i> and the water was pouring down,</i>

1:13:57.432 --> 1:14:02.204
<i> and he was still masturbating.</i>

1:14:03.009 --> 1:14:04.514
<i> Then he got angry.</i>

1:14:04.549 --> 1:14:08.617
<i> I think my crying was so loud</i>
<i> it put him off.</i>

1:14:08.652 --> 1:14:13.754
<i> And he left the bathroom,</i>
<i> and I locked the door.</i>

1:14:13.789 --> 1:14:15.316
(shower running)

1:14:15.351 --> 1:14:19.221
<i> And I could still hear him</i>
<i> on the other side.</i>

1:14:19.256 --> 1:14:22.994
<i> Still the sounds</i>
<i> of him masturbating.</i>

1:14:24.899 --> 1:14:27.064
<i> Finally, I went back</i>
<i> into the room itself</i>

1:14:27.099 --> 1:14:31.035
<i> and grabbed my clothes</i>
<i> and belongings, and I just ran.</i>

1:14:31.070 --> 1:14:33.334
<i> I ran down the street.</i>

1:14:33.369 --> 1:14:37.613
<i> I've never run</i>
<i> that fast in my life.</i>

1:14:43.445 --> 1:14:45.918
How do you feel about it now?

1:14:51.860 --> 1:14:54.454
(sighs):
I...

1:14:54.489 --> 1:14:56.830
I... I feel like

1:14:56.865 --> 1:15:01.164
it dictated a certain direction
my life took.

1:15:01.199 --> 1:15:04.970
That-- I just felt that it was
this huge e-error of judgment

1:15:05.005 --> 1:15:08.743
that sort of marked me
and all my decisions.

1:15:09.713 --> 1:15:11.240
And...

1:15:12.914 --> 1:15:15.684
...I felt such shame...

1:15:17.413 --> 1:15:21.052
...that I let him do that.

1:15:23.452 --> 1:15:26.222
Did you think that he had done
the same to other girls?

1:15:26.257 --> 1:15:28.862
I thought that
he must've tried it.

1:15:30.668 --> 1:15:33.196
(voice breaking):
But that they'd all s...

1:15:34.705 --> 1:15:36.936
...they'd all said no.

1:15:40.403 --> 1:15:44.141
It was like he t-took
my voice that day.

1:15:46.211 --> 1:15:51.148
Just when I was
about to start finding it.

1:15:51.183 --> 1:15:52.853
(sniffles)

1:15:53.955 --> 1:15:56.186
-(phones ringing)
-(busy TV and office chatter)

1:15:59.389 --> 1:16:00.586
DEAN:
Yes?

1:16:00.621 --> 1:16:01.862
WOMAN (over phone):
I have Harvey Weinstein

1:16:01.897 --> 1:16:03.930
on the phone for you.

1:16:03.965 --> 1:16:06.196
DEAN:
Put him through. Thank you.

1:16:08.134 --> 1:16:10.266
HARVEY: Dean, how are you?
This is Harvey.

1:16:10.301 --> 1:16:13.005
Hi, Harvey.
What can I do for you?

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:16.074
If I hadn't made movies,
I would've been a journalist.

1:16:16.978 --> 1:16:19.682
Dean, I heard someone was
working on a story about me.

1:16:19.717 --> 1:16:22.377
Yes. If you'd like to talk
to the reporters on the record,

1:16:22.412 --> 1:16:24.918
-they'd welcome that.
-I want to talk to you, Dean.

1:16:24.953 --> 1:16:27.085
Well, talk to my reporters
about your concerns.

1:16:27.120 --> 1:16:29.384
I'm sorry. I have work to do.

1:16:29.419 --> 1:16:30.517
Are you gonna hang up?

1:16:30.552 --> 1:16:33.223
Unless you have
anything else to say.

1:16:33.258 --> 1:16:34.994
I love the truth.

1:16:35.029 --> 1:16:37.667
People make up stories a lot.

1:16:37.702 --> 1:16:39.031
Be careful of that.

1:16:39.066 --> 1:16:41.297
That's fine, Harvey. Goodbye.

1:16:42.597 --> 1:16:44.839

Hey, Tim.

DEAN:
<i> So, what do we have?</i>

1:17:10.834 --> 1:17:13.736
Well, the biggest thing is
the documents that Jodi got

1:17:13.771 --> 1:17:15.232
from Zelda Perkins in London.

1:17:15.267 --> 1:17:17.333
Rose is still off the record,

1:17:17.368 --> 1:17:20.534
but she has given us permission
to write about her settlement.

1:17:20.569 --> 1:17:22.943
We're just trying to figure out
a way to confirm it.

1:17:22.978 --> 1:17:25.011
Harvey offered her
a million dollars recently

1:17:25.046 --> 1:17:27.607
for her silence.

1:17:27.642 --> 1:17:29.279
-And?
-Rose refused,

1:17:29.314 --> 1:17:30.951
but she doesn't want us
to quote her.

1:17:30.986 --> 1:17:32.678
There are still
no on-the-record sources.

1:17:32.713 --> 1:17:33.987
NDAs are a problem.

1:17:34.022 --> 1:17:36.286
MEGAN:
Laura Madden didn't sign one.

1:17:36.321 --> 1:17:39.124
She's the only ex-assistant who
is technically free to speak.

1:17:39.159 --> 1:17:40.994
Ashley and Gwyneth
didn't sign one either,

1:17:41.029 --> 1:17:42.391
but they're not ready
to go on the record.

1:17:42.426 --> 1:17:44.393
But Laura Madden
has to deal with something

1:17:44.428 --> 1:17:46.736
-very different right now.
-She has breast cancer.

1:17:46.771 --> 1:17:49.904
She has to go into surgery,
so it's not likely.

1:17:49.939 --> 1:17:51.807
I'm still leaving messages
for Rowena Chiu,

1:17:51.842 --> 1:17:54.106
but there's no engagement.

1:17:54.141 --> 1:17:55.536
So, no more proven settlements.

1:17:55.571 --> 1:17:58.440
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
almost certainly settled.

1:17:58.475 --> 1:18:00.849
And John Schmidt confirmed
that Miramax settled

1:18:00.884 --> 1:18:02.411
with the woman
I visited in Queens.

1:18:02.446 --> 1:18:04.479
Anything more on the article
from<i> The New Yorker?</i>

1:18:04.514 --> 1:18:05.788
No.

1:18:05.823 --> 1:18:09.715
Lanny Davis and David Boies
want to come talk to us.

1:18:09.750 --> 1:18:11.255
What do you think?

1:18:11.290 --> 1:18:13.257
Don't we want to wait
and push for

1:18:13.292 --> 1:18:15.160
an on-the-record interview
with Weinstein?

1:18:15.195 --> 1:18:16.326
It's your call, Binky.

1:18:16.361 --> 1:18:19.164
I'd like to talk to Lanny
at least.

1:18:19.199 --> 1:18:20.803
See what he has to say.

1:18:20.838 --> 1:18:22.662
LANNY:<i> Harvey's not</i>
<i> always that rational.</i>

1:18:22.697 --> 1:18:24.873
<i> The reason I'm here</i>
<i> as his representative</i>

1:18:24.908 --> 1:18:26.534
<i> is not to try to kill anything.</i>

1:18:26.569 --> 1:18:28.734
<i> I want to know that</i>
<i> if you're including something</i>

1:18:28.769 --> 1:18:31.946
<i> like Rósa McGowan's claim,</i>
<i> then we can defend that.</i>

1:18:31.981 --> 1:18:33.409
REBECCA:
<i> Of course.</i>

1:18:33.444 --> 1:18:35.147
Please.

1:18:38.515 --> 1:18:42.517
I know you'll be investigating
with due diligence.

1:18:42.552 --> 1:18:43.584
-Lanny...
-Mm-hmm?

1:18:43.619 --> 1:18:45.454
...you'll have
every chance to respond.

1:18:45.489 --> 1:18:47.489
Oh. Uh...

1:18:47.524 --> 1:18:49.557
And I trust
it's okay to record this?

1:18:49.592 --> 1:18:51.757
Oh, of course. Sure.

1:18:51.792 --> 1:18:55.464
I don't expect you to name
sources, but if it's possible

1:18:55.499 --> 1:18:58.940
for you to let me know overall
what your story's about?

1:18:58.975 --> 1:19:01.305
We're looking into
problematic behavior

1:19:01.340 --> 1:19:03.406
towards women by Weinstein.

1:19:04.211 --> 1:19:06.673
Okay. (inhales deeply)

1:19:06.708 --> 1:19:10.677
Harvey adamantly denies any
allegation of rape or assault.

1:19:10.712 --> 1:19:12.382
Nothing criminal.

1:19:12.417 --> 1:19:16.650
But he is aware of complaints
about his treatment of women,

1:19:16.685 --> 1:19:19.158
and he is working on that.

1:19:19.963 --> 1:19:23.162
Powerful men
of an older generation

1:19:23.197 --> 1:19:24.592
are changing their understanding

1:19:24.627 --> 1:19:26.561
of the meaning of the word
"consensual."

1:19:26.596 --> 1:19:28.530
Why women don't feel
it's consensual

1:19:28.565 --> 1:19:31.401
even if a man
convinces himself it is.

1:19:31.436 --> 1:19:34.008
Do you want to expand on that?

1:19:34.043 --> 1:19:36.604
Uh, I believe (chuckles)

1:19:36.639 --> 1:19:39.706
there's a story to be told
about the evolution of men.

1:19:39.741 --> 1:19:42.313
And, in particular, Harvey
on this subject.

1:19:42.348 --> 1:19:45.085
Uh, would he be willing
to talk to us about it?

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:47.351
On the record.

1:19:48.288 --> 1:19:50.816
He has to deal with
his wife and children

1:19:50.851 --> 1:19:52.125
before anything else.

1:19:52.930 --> 1:19:58.395
You're adamant Rose McGowan's
rape accusation is false.

1:19:58.430 --> 1:20:00.199
Why is that?

1:20:00.234 --> 1:20:01.937
Did she tell anybody right away?

1:20:01.972 --> 1:20:03.400
Did she show
any signs of distress?

1:20:03.435 --> 1:20:06.370
She told her manager
and a lawyer.

1:20:08.407 --> 1:20:11.144
Harvey was aware that
there was a problem with Rose,

1:20:11.179 --> 1:20:13.608
but not that
she was accusing him of rape.

1:20:13.643 --> 1:20:16.182
So I draw a bright line
on the word "rape."

1:20:16.217 --> 1:20:18.580
Anything below that line,

1:20:18.615 --> 1:20:21.715
uh, he was aware of
feelings, concerns.

1:20:21.750 --> 1:20:23.156
Of what kind?

1:20:23.191 --> 1:20:24.454
I'm sorry. What...

1:20:24.489 --> 1:20:26.786
If the concerns
were not about rape,

1:20:26.821 --> 1:20:28.656
what were they about?

1:20:30.429 --> 1:20:33.463
The only way I can answer
is, um...

1:20:34.939 --> 1:20:36.466
...a sense of exploitation

1:20:36.501 --> 1:20:40.800
because of that
disparate power relationship.

1:20:40.835 --> 1:20:44.804
There's mental coercion
that isn't physical coercion.

1:20:44.839 --> 1:20:47.345
Lisa Bloom has been
working with Harvey

1:20:47.380 --> 1:20:49.050
to help him
recognize the difference.

1:20:49.085 --> 1:20:50.414
Lisa Bloom?

1:20:50.449 --> 1:20:52.251
Yeah.

1:20:52.286 --> 1:20:54.814
MEGAN:
If Harvey had been made aware

1:20:54.849 --> 1:21:00.061
of McGowan's concerns
at the time, how did he respond?

1:21:01.295 --> 1:21:03.592
I think he had dealings legally
with her about them.

1:21:03.627 --> 1:21:08.135
And how would you characterize
those legal dealings?

1:21:09.831 --> 1:21:11.402
I think he became aware that

1:21:11.437 --> 1:21:14.141
she did not regard
what happened as okay with her.

1:21:14.176 --> 1:21:15.703
I'm not talking about rape.

1:21:15.738 --> 1:21:19.949
I'm talking about the effect
he had on Rose McGowan.

1:21:19.984 --> 1:21:22.512
And that rather than fighting...

1:21:23.317 --> 1:21:24.954
"Rather than fighting"?

1:21:24.989 --> 1:21:28.188
Then... then what?

1:21:30.555 --> 1:21:33.721
I-I think he has agreed
to settlements

1:21:33.756 --> 1:21:36.394
rather than litigating
what might have been litigated.

1:21:36.429 --> 1:21:39.463
As Harvey saw it,
it was better to settle,

1:21:39.498 --> 1:21:41.267
even if you haven't done
anything wrong.

1:21:41.302 --> 1:21:43.533
He preferred to settle.

1:21:45.075 --> 1:21:48.604
Were there other cases of
questionable intimate relations

1:21:48.639 --> 1:21:51.244
with women
in which Weinstein settled?

1:21:53.512 --> 1:21:57.052
Let's say for now,
even on a background basis,

1:21:57.087 --> 1:21:59.681
that I need to find out
what my limits are legally.

1:21:59.716 --> 1:22:03.586
Even if on background,
I'm confirming settlements.

1:22:03.621 --> 1:22:08.228
But the-the answer is yes,
there have been.

1:22:10.925 --> 1:22:13.068
How many?

1:22:14.764 --> 1:22:16.302
(softly):
No.

1:22:17.074 --> 1:22:18.832
(Lanny chuckles)

1:22:18.867 --> 1:22:22.374
To admit to settlements this
early, they're in real trouble.

1:22:22.409 --> 1:22:24.178
-We need to find out a number.
-(Megan chuckles)

1:22:24.213 --> 1:22:25.641
We need to corroborate each one.

1:22:25.676 --> 1:22:27.643
-I'm on it.
-(phone vibrating)

1:22:27.678 --> 1:22:31.581
Have you guys had any dealings
with Diana Filip?

1:22:31.616 --> 1:22:33.715
-No. -I said no to speaking
at a women's conference.

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:36.751
-She just keeps on calling me.
-Did you have her checked out?

1:22:36.786 --> 1:22:38.522
Security consultant says
she's legit,

1:22:38.557 --> 1:22:40.689
but who has time
for these random people?

1:22:42.891 --> 1:22:45.133
(phone vibrating)

1:22:54.034 --> 1:22:55.374
Hello?

1:22:55.409 --> 1:22:56.771
WOMAN (over phone):
I worked at Miramax.

1:22:56.806 --> 1:22:59.048
Talk to Irwin Reiter.
He hates Weinstein.

1:22:59.083 --> 1:23:00.478
(line clicks)

1:23:05.122 --> 1:23:07.353
(phone vibrating)

1:23:10.457 --> 1:23:12.259
Hey. Are you okay?

1:23:12.294 --> 1:23:15.064
JODI (over phone):
Did I wake you?

1:23:15.099 --> 1:23:17.627
Um, yeah. What's up?

1:23:17.662 --> 1:23:20.894
JODI: What do you know
about Irwin Reiter?

1:23:22.172 --> 1:23:25.305
Hang on.
I put together a file on him.

1:23:25.340 --> 1:23:28.539
I need to write
a good fucking email.

1:23:40.421 --> 1:23:43.158
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

1:23:43.193 --> 1:23:44.918
You want to get me killed?

1:23:52.136 --> 1:23:56.765
So, Irwin, you've been an
accountant for the Weinsteins

1:23:56.800 --> 1:23:58.503
for 30 years.

1:24:00.067 --> 1:24:01.374
(pours drink)

1:24:01.409 --> 1:24:02.936
I pick up the check,

1:24:02.971 --> 1:24:04.872
and I reserve the right
to leave after five minutes.

1:24:04.907 --> 1:24:06.038
(clears throat)

1:24:06.073 --> 1:24:09.415
So, um...
what do you want to know?

1:24:09.450 --> 1:24:11.681
We have information
on several settlements

1:24:11.716 --> 1:24:13.485
that Weinstein made in the '90s,

1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:16.290
paid to actresses
and ex-employees.

1:24:16.325 --> 1:24:19.557
Could you tell me anything
about that?

1:24:21.627 --> 1:24:23.825
Could you confirm
those settlements

1:24:23.860 --> 1:24:25.431
and how it was
from your perspective?

1:24:25.466 --> 1:24:27.532
My perspective?

1:24:28.568 --> 1:24:30.931
Would it be company money
that was used?

1:24:32.506 --> 1:24:35.903
You wrote that we're from
the same tiny world.

1:24:35.938 --> 1:24:37.245
Yeah.

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:39.313
Summers at bungalows
in the Catskills.

1:24:39.348 --> 1:24:41.942
Meals at Lefty's and Pop-Ins.

1:24:41.977 --> 1:24:44.945
What do you remember
about those holidays?

1:24:44.980 --> 1:24:48.256
Gosh, I remember so many things.

1:24:48.291 --> 1:24:49.983
It's the first time
I remember seeing

1:24:50.018 --> 1:24:52.084
my grandmother's arms bare.

1:24:52.119 --> 1:24:56.924
I knew those tattoos meant
something seismic.

1:24:56.959 --> 1:24:58.794
Yeah, h-how did you know?

1:24:58.829 --> 1:25:00.169
I just sensed it.

1:25:00.204 --> 1:25:03.238
Did your family discuss it?

1:25:06.408 --> 1:25:09.178
Who else are you talking to?

1:25:09.213 --> 1:25:11.510
I can't disclose that, Irwin.

1:25:13.679 --> 1:25:16.977
You know, my parents,
uh, they couldn't go there.

1:25:17.012 --> 1:25:19.386
They rarely discussed it.

1:25:20.653 --> 1:25:22.752
It's so mysterious, isn't it?

1:25:23.557 --> 1:25:25.920
Why some families talk.

1:25:25.955 --> 1:25:27.559
Some don't.

1:25:29.156 --> 1:25:34.159
The money Weinstein was
spending was, you know, crazy.

1:25:34.194 --> 1:25:35.204
I tried.

1:25:35.239 --> 1:25:36.898
I tried many times to

1:25:36.933 --> 1:25:39.868
get the board to do something
about him, but they just kept

1:25:39.903 --> 1:25:42.376
ignoring his behavior
and keeping him on.

1:25:42.411 --> 1:25:44.543
Why is that?

1:25:45.447 --> 1:25:48.349
Have you talked to L.O.C.?

1:25:48.384 --> 1:25:50.813
Or, uh, Z.P.?

1:25:50.848 --> 1:25:53.079
Who is L.O.C.?

1:25:53.114 --> 1:25:55.257
There was this memo.

1:25:55.292 --> 1:25:58.359
Let me ask you something, Jodi,
that's really puzzling me.

1:25:58.394 --> 1:26:01.087
Why are you asking
about the '90s

1:26:01.122 --> 1:26:04.860
when Weinstein has committed
so many more recent offenses?

1:26:06.270 --> 1:26:08.633
I got to go.

1:26:08.668 --> 1:26:10.932
-I'll give you a call.
-Irwin.

1:26:15.070 --> 1:26:17.312
♪ ♪

1:26:35.189 --> 1:26:38.432
(breathes deeply)

1:26:42.229 --> 1:26:44.031
(door opens)

1:26:44.066 --> 1:26:46.033
(crying):
Mom.

1:26:46.068 --> 1:26:47.672
I had a nightmare.

1:26:47.707 --> 1:26:50.807
-Oh, honey, come here.
-(sobs)

1:26:52.910 --> 1:26:56.417
-(crying softly)
-(shushing)

1:26:56.452 --> 1:26:58.683
(whispering):
It's okay. It's okay.

1:26:58.718 --> 1:27:00.487
I heard that
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez

1:27:00.522 --> 1:27:02.654
just got
a seven-figure settlement.

1:27:02.689 --> 1:27:06.625
And that Weinstein now owns
the audio of the incident?

1:27:07.892 --> 1:27:11.058
These settlements, Lanny...

1:27:11.093 --> 1:27:12.565
what are we talking?

1:27:13.799 --> 1:27:16.096
I can't tell you that, Megan.

1:27:16.131 --> 1:27:17.537
You know that.

1:27:17.572 --> 1:27:19.099
I'm not talking about
naming you, of course.

1:27:19.134 --> 1:27:22.905
It would just be great
for background

1:27:22.940 --> 1:27:24.170
to know a number

1:27:24.205 --> 1:27:27.074
of the other settlements
that you're aware of.

1:27:27.879 --> 1:27:30.242
-I'm not a bad guy here.
-I know that.

1:27:30.277 --> 1:27:32.651
My profession is
to get the facts

1:27:32.686 --> 1:27:35.489
into the hands
of reporters, but...

1:27:35.524 --> 1:27:38.393
(laughs):
you know, I can't help.

1:27:40.892 --> 1:27:43.860
I keep getting 40 in my head.

1:27:43.895 --> 1:27:44.960
(sighs)

1:27:44.995 --> 1:27:47.732
Which would be
ridiculous, right?

1:27:50.231 --> 1:27:51.967
Right?

1:27:52.002 --> 1:27:53.573
(smacks lips)

1:27:55.071 --> 1:27:56.477
It's not 40.

1:27:58.778 --> 1:28:02.582
Seriously, it's-it's,
uh, less than 40.

1:28:02.617 --> 1:28:04.584
Good. That's a relief.

1:28:04.619 --> 1:28:06.179
-(scoffs): Sure.
-(laughs)

1:28:08.117 --> 1:28:10.117
So...

1:28:10.922 --> 1:28:14.924
...less than half of 40, then?

1:28:14.959 --> 1:28:15.859
Check.

1:28:15.894 --> 1:28:17.366
Oh, and what the fuck, Lanny?

1:28:17.401 --> 1:28:19.962
We heard that Ronan Farrow
is working on a story.

1:28:19.997 --> 1:28:21.029
No, no.

1:28:21.064 --> 1:28:23.867
That is done. Over.

1:28:25.475 --> 1:28:28.036
I don't see you
as a bad guy, Lanny.

1:28:28.841 --> 1:28:31.413
I-I don't. I never have.
I respect you.

1:28:31.448 --> 1:28:33.041
Uh, I respect you.

1:28:35.881 --> 1:28:37.947
(sighs)

1:28:37.982 --> 1:28:41.181
This is all
gonna come out, Lanny.

1:28:41.216 --> 1:28:43.183
Publicly.

1:28:43.218 --> 1:28:44.558
Generally does.

1:28:44.593 --> 1:28:46.659
(chuckles)

1:28:46.694 --> 1:28:48.826
-(laughs): Okay.
-(laughing)

1:28:50.632 --> 1:28:53.435
Wh... What am I laughing about?

1:28:53.470 --> 1:28:55.327
(both laugh)

1:28:55.362 --> 1:28:58.671
(sighs):
Oh, Megan.

1:28:59.608 --> 1:29:01.003
Lanny.

1:29:09.651 --> 1:29:11.882
I'd say eight to 12 settlements.

1:29:17.461 --> 1:29:19.494
(sighs softly)

1:29:24.765 --> 1:29:27.667
And do you think that's normal?

1:29:27.702 --> 1:29:29.834
For men to make so many payoffs?

1:29:35.138 --> 1:29:37.908
I do. Yeah.

1:29:41.408 --> 1:29:43.980
It feels like we're so close.

1:29:44.015 --> 1:29:47.951
Do you think we'll get it?
What if we don't?

1:29:47.986 --> 1:29:49.689
I'm having nightmares about him.

1:29:49.724 --> 1:29:52.560
-Oh, my God. I have them, too.
-Yeah?

1:29:52.595 --> 1:29:54.353
I'm terrified we know all this

1:29:54.388 --> 1:29:57.796
and we might go to our graves
knowing it.

1:29:57.831 --> 1:29:59.391
The story will run.

1:29:59.426 --> 1:30:02.900
My worry is people won't care.

1:30:02.935 --> 1:30:06.134
And he won't even be
slowed down, let alone stopped.

1:30:06.169 --> 1:30:08.609
It's like
an ocean of wrongdoing.

1:30:08.644 --> 1:30:10.105
I mean, can you imagine

1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:13.548
how many Harveys there are
out there, every day?

1:30:13.583 --> 1:30:15.814
I sometimes wonder...

1:30:18.445 --> 1:30:22.150
...when I had Mira, if...

1:30:23.351 --> 1:30:27.254
...if all the trauma,
not just in me but in...

1:30:27.289 --> 1:30:30.796
but in all w-women I talked to,
if it just...

1:30:30.831 --> 1:30:33.062
this darkness,
this constant violence,

1:30:33.097 --> 1:30:35.801
if it just sort of imploded.

1:30:36.738 --> 1:30:41.576
Maybe-maybe that's part of
the depression that hits women.

1:30:45.142 --> 1:30:48.275
Do you wish you hadn't
signed up for this story?

1:30:50.081 --> 1:30:51.883
Do you?

1:30:53.381 --> 1:30:54.446
No.

1:30:54.481 --> 1:30:56.756
(chuckles):
No.

1:31:03.127 --> 1:31:07.734
JODI: The last time we met,
you mentioned a memo?

1:31:13.709 --> 1:31:14.939
(smacks lips)

1:31:14.974 --> 1:31:18.613
It was, uh,
from an ex-executive,

1:31:18.648 --> 1:31:20.439
and it was extensive, scathing.

1:31:20.474 --> 1:31:21.979
She sent it to the board.

1:31:22.014 --> 1:31:24.344
When was this?
How did they react?

1:31:24.379 --> 1:31:26.445
Oh, it was a short burst
of behind-doors mayhem,

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:28.480
and then she left.

1:31:28.515 --> 1:31:30.889
What did her memo say?

1:31:30.924 --> 1:31:33.221
That the company was
a toxic environment.

1:31:35.522 --> 1:31:37.192
Would anyone have a copy?

1:31:37.227 --> 1:31:38.864
(laughs)

1:31:44.234 --> 1:31:45.805
Hey.

1:31:46.940 --> 1:31:49.776
-Sorry it's so late.
-Mm.

1:31:52.308 --> 1:31:54.473
-(Megan sighs)
-JODI:<i> You okay?</i>

1:31:54.508 --> 1:31:56.585
Uh, Talia was up late.

1:31:56.620 --> 1:31:58.048
Violet woke up twice.

1:31:58.083 --> 1:32:00.413
I have an inbox
filled with enraged people

1:32:00.448 --> 1:32:03.823
about this insurance story,
which is going to be huge.

1:32:03.858 --> 1:32:07.486
There's already
hundreds of emails here,

1:32:07.521 --> 1:32:08.861
and there is... (laughs)

1:32:08.896 --> 1:32:11.127
a hurricane
heading towards Florida.

1:32:11.162 --> 1:32:13.492
So, I am going to somehow
fly down there

1:32:13.527 --> 1:32:15.098
and move my dad someplace else

1:32:15.133 --> 1:32:17.166
before he is
literally blown away.

1:32:17.201 --> 1:32:20.532
And I have a slight
nervous twitch in my eye.

1:32:20.567 --> 1:32:22.270
Let me see.

1:32:24.879 --> 1:32:26.571
(Ron sighs)

1:32:26.606 --> 1:32:29.343
(laughter, playful chatter)

1:32:30.786 --> 1:32:32.445
-Hey. Hey.
-Come here, Crabby.

1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:34.689
-Get that raisin. -Holly?
-(laughter continues)

1:32:34.724 --> 1:32:36.482
-(ringtone playing)
-Slow down!

1:32:36.517 --> 1:32:38.891
Um, here. Will you hold
Crabby for a second?

1:32:38.926 --> 1:32:40.321
Least they're having fun.

1:32:41.555 --> 1:32:43.192
Hi. This is Jodi Kantor.

1:32:43.227 --> 1:32:44.897
ROWENA (over phone):
This is Rowena Chiu.

1:32:44.932 --> 1:32:46.734
I'm in New York.

1:32:46.769 --> 1:32:48.901
Do you still want to meet up?

1:32:49.739 --> 1:32:51.838
ROWENA:
I couldn't tell anyone.

1:32:51.873 --> 1:32:55.204
Not my parents,
not even my husband.

1:32:55.239 --> 1:32:56.975
Why not?

1:32:58.077 --> 1:33:00.407
I grew up
in an immigrant household.

1:33:00.442 --> 1:33:03.146
I was taught
to keep my head down,

1:33:03.181 --> 1:33:07.018
work hard and not draw
attention to myself, you know?

1:33:07.053 --> 1:33:08.514
In Chinese culture,

1:33:08.549 --> 1:33:12.452
I felt I had to protect
my family at all costs.

1:33:12.487 --> 1:33:15.994
And I was young, scared.

1:33:18.361 --> 1:33:21.802
Can you tell me anything about
what happened in Venice?

1:33:24.070 --> 1:33:27.005
This is off the record, yeah?

1:33:30.670 --> 1:33:32.208
I had the evening shifts,

1:33:32.243 --> 1:33:35.343
going through notes
on screenplays with Harvey.

1:33:35.378 --> 1:33:41.217
One night, we were working,
and he kept trying to touch me.

1:33:41.252 --> 1:33:43.417
I didn't want to make him angry.

1:33:43.452 --> 1:33:46.860
He's a very big man.

1:33:46.895 --> 1:33:49.159
I kept trying
to get back to the notes.

1:33:49.194 --> 1:33:52.492
And that went on
for a few hours,

1:33:52.527 --> 1:33:54.461
just trying to avoid him.

1:33:54.496 --> 1:33:56.529
How did you do that?

1:33:57.741 --> 1:34:00.533
I would just fight him off.

1:34:01.701 --> 1:34:03.503
I'd worn two pairs of tights

1:34:03.538 --> 1:34:07.672
to buy me some time
if I ever needed it.

1:34:07.707 --> 1:34:10.510
But finally,

1:34:10.545 --> 1:34:13.854
he held me down.

1:34:13.889 --> 1:34:17.858
Not forcefully,
but like it was a game.

1:34:17.893 --> 1:34:19.024
(stammers softly)

1:34:19.059 --> 1:34:23.391
Then he parted my legs,

1:34:23.426 --> 1:34:25.327
and he said...

1:34:26.462 --> 1:34:30.871
"Please, just one thrust,
and it'll all be over."

1:34:34.811 --> 1:34:36.041
I got away.

1:34:36.076 --> 1:34:38.010
I was traumatized.

1:34:38.045 --> 1:34:39.308
I was a Christian.

1:34:39.343 --> 1:34:42.113
I was still
with my first boyfriend.

1:34:42.148 --> 1:34:44.610
And you shared this with Zelda?

1:34:44.645 --> 1:34:50.055
Zelda was completely enraged
and very brave in facing him.

1:34:50.090 --> 1:34:51.584
We both resigned.

1:34:51.619 --> 1:34:53.553

if I worked for Harvey,

1:34:58.934 --> 1:35:00.263
why would I leave?

1:35:01.695 --> 1:35:04.300
The NDA that we signed,

1:35:04.335 --> 1:35:06.665
it stipulated that
if I ever had trouble

1:35:06.700 --> 1:35:10.570
getting a job in film again,
I was to go back to Harvey

1:35:10.605 --> 1:35:12.979
or his lawyer Hutensky for help.

1:35:13.773 --> 1:35:16.983
I asked them for a reference,

1:35:17.018 --> 1:35:21.317
and Hutensky,
he kept repeating...

1:35:21.352 --> 1:35:23.484

1:35:35.267 --> 1:35:38.598

Are you, Harvey?

1:56:49.969 --> 1:56:53.212
HARVEY:
Yes. I'm gonna take time off.

1:56:53.247 --> 1:56:55.280
From the company?

1:56:55.315 --> 1:56:58.184
Yes. I want to spend
some time learning.

1:56:58.219 --> 1:56:59.779
LISA:
Learning and listening to me.

1:56:59.814 --> 1:57:02.188

a leave of absence.

Perfect.

Hi. Laura, how are you?

1:57:13.795 --> 1:57:17.302
LAURA (over phone):
Yes, I'm okay.

1:57:17.337 --> 1:57:20.437
Today's my surgery.
I'm about to go in.

1:57:20.472 --> 1:57:25.508
Um, look, I never signed
any contract.

1:57:25.543 --> 1:57:29.347
I'm not gagged,
and I want to speak out

1:57:29.382 --> 1:57:31.910
on behalf of the women
who can't.

1:57:32.913 --> 1:57:35.419
I have three daughters,
and I don't want them

1:57:35.454 --> 1:57:38.653
to ever accept
abuse or bullying as normal.

1:57:39.788 --> 1:57:42.393
You can use anything I've said.

1:57:42.428 --> 1:57:45.264
I'll do it.

1:57:45.299 --> 1:57:47.596
I'll go on the record.

1:57:48.830 --> 1:57:51.237
Thank you, Laura.
