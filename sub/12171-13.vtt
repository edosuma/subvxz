[Music playing]

07:01.250 --> 07:02.417
This is it.

07:04.167 --> 07:05.458
- Hey.
- You ready, cutie pie?

07:05.461 --> 07:07.708
- Yes, I'm going to impress you
- so much tonight.

07:07.750 --> 07:08.792
- Are you?
- Yes.

07:08.795 --> 07:10.292
I can't believe you came.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.625
- How's it going, guys?
- Hey.

07:14.628 --> 07:15.726
- Have you guys
- been here before?

07:15.750 --> 07:16.750
- No, never.
- No.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.125
This cage right over here.

07:18.167 --> 07:19.542
Since we got back from Belize,

07:19.583 --> 07:20.624
like, I've just been hanging out

07:20.625 --> 07:22.208
with my boyfriend a lot at home,

07:22.250 --> 07:23.833
it's been, like, awesome.

07:25.292 --> 07:26.625
I'm just kidding,

07:26.626 --> 07:27.957
I'm just mocking myself

07:27.958 --> 07:29.458
because actually, I have been,

07:29.500 --> 07:31.291
I have been nesting.

07:31.292 --> 07:32.791
You have to, you have to nurture

07:32.792 --> 07:33.875
the relationship.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.188
The guy flew

07:35.189 --> 07:36.458
across the world to Belize

07:36.500 --> 07:38.124
and I wanna, you know,

07:38.125 --> 07:40.291
stay home and cook him dinner.

07:40.292 --> 07:41.624
I have to pitch the ball?

07:41.625 --> 07:43.393
- Yes, so you're gonna be
- throwing to each other.

07:43.417 --> 07:44.458
- How am I gonna pitch it
- to you?

07:44.461 --> 07:45.666
Like that.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.347
- Well, no, I'm gonna throw
- to you first.

07:49.042 --> 07:50.792
Let's go. Ready, babe?

07:50.833 --> 07:52.083
Do I look ready?

07:52.125 --> 07:53.375
Yes.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.958
Babe.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Hey-o.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.479
Okay, switch.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.958
Okay.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.332
Holy sh...

When it comes to baseball

08:06.480 --> 08:07.625
and softball...

Incoming.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.250
Ahh.

08:10.292 --> 08:12.000
I'd rather swing the bat

08:12.042 --> 08:14.583
than try to catch the ball,

08:14.625 --> 08:16.667
- unless I'm catching a ball
- in my mouth,

08:16.670 --> 08:17.792
Which is a totally

08:17.793 --> 08:18.917
different topic.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.667
Okay, out of balls.

08:20.708 --> 08:21.792
You need some more balls?

08:21.833 --> 08:22.953
Here, I'll help you pick up.

08:24.458 --> 08:25.833
- You did so good.
- I mean, it was okay.

08:25.836 --> 08:26.976
- This is where people
- come to...

08:27.000 --> 08:28.042
- Get better?
- To teach...

08:28.043 --> 08:29.059
No, to teach, like, their kids.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.226
It'll be a good place to come

08:30.250 --> 08:31.542
when we have a kid,

08:31.583 --> 08:32.874
we could bring 'em here.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.208
What do you think?

08:34.250 --> 08:35.333
Of?

08:35.375 --> 08:36.541
A kid would be good, no?

08:36.542 --> 08:37.542
A kid?

08:37.543 --> 08:38.542
Yeah, a kid.

08:38.543 --> 08:40.500
- No good?
- No, I'm not saying that.

08:40.542 --> 08:41.833
- Why not?
- I'm not saying that.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.041
When we were at Dr.

08:43.042 --> 08:44.042
What's-his-face,

08:44.083 --> 08:45.792
you were all about it.

Dr. ghadir wants me

08:47.500 --> 08:50.542
to get inseminated right now,

08:50.583 --> 08:51.646
so in exactly

08:51.647 --> 08:52.707
nine and a half months,

08:52.708 --> 08:54.041
I'll be having a baby.

08:54.042 --> 08:55.292
Is my relationship in a place

08:55.293 --> 08:56.542
for that right now?

08:56.583 --> 08:58.167
I don't know.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.500
I feel like my priorities

08:59.501 --> 09:00.792
in life have always been,

09:00.833 --> 09:02.500
my career has been first.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.500
Yeah.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.541
And now, there's you.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.707
Okay.

09:06.708 --> 09:07.833
And then now,

09:07.875 --> 09:10.167
- with Dr. ghadir,
- I never felt so much pressure

09:10.208 --> 09:12.082
Ever in my life over anything.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.250
- It's not something
- just to leap into for no reason,

09:14.253 --> 09:16.167
- But this is inspiring here,
- you know?

09:16.208 --> 09:17.888
- Because this is what
- it would be about.

09:19.375 --> 09:21.708
I mean, I'm about this life.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.590
- I think we're gonna have
- some awesome kids.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.417
- I think they're gonna be
- really good at this.

09:25.420 --> 09:27.667
You looked really impressive.

09:27.708 --> 09:28.979
Our kid will be

09:28.980 --> 09:30.249
so gorgeous it's illegal,

09:30.250 --> 09:32.209

Do I have a ring on this finger?

09:41.708 --> 09:42.749
No, I do not.

Get that Turkey baster

09:44.250 --> 09:46.875
away from my vagina right now.

09:48.083 --> 09:49.749
Yeah, you're cute.

- Coming up...
- If we're referring to Belize,

10:00.792 --> 10:02.124

10:02.125 --> 10:03.750
at customs in Mexico.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.472
- This is what heart attacks
- are made of.

10:15.417 --> 10:16.583
I need a large iced tea

10:16.625 --> 10:18.083
with three agaves please,

10:18.125 --> 10:19.792
or a fresh-squeezed

10:19.793 --> 10:21.457
orange juice.

I need a fresh-squeezed...

10:24.958 --> 10:26.124
What do I want?

10:26.125 --> 10:27.792
- I'm gonna put my foot
- in some orange juice

10:27.793 --> 10:28.793
And bring it for you.

10:28.833 --> 10:29.938
Adam and I try to get

10:29.939 --> 10:31.042
to palm Springs

10:31.083 --> 10:32.167
about twice a month.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.833
It's almost like

10:33.834 --> 10:35.458
we go there to refuel

10:35.500 --> 10:36.625
and recharge,

10:36.667 --> 10:37.917
there's a very positive

10:37.918 --> 10:39.166
energy there.

10:39.167 --> 10:40.500
This may sound cliche,

10:40.542 --> 10:41.771
because I left Iran

10:41.772 --> 10:42.999
when I was two.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.499
I imagine Iran in the 70s

10:45.500 --> 10:48.000
was much like palm Springs.

10:48.042 --> 10:49.792
- Thank you...
- I don't want any.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.125
- Honey.
- Honey.

very hot and dry,

10:55.167 --> 10:56.500

10:56.501 --> 10:57.832
a cool mid-century house,

10:57.833 --> 10:59.625
lots of money and a Mercedes.

Oh god, oh sh...

11:03.708 --> 11:05.332
His anal glands

11:05.333 --> 11:06.666
need to be expressed.

11:06.667 --> 11:07.684
You guys keep saying that,

11:07.708 --> 11:09.250
- can you just handle it?
- Expressed?

11:09.292 --> 11:10.458
He's just a little guy.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.832
He's just little.

11:11.833 --> 11:12.958
Reza and Adam's house

11:13.000 --> 11:14.500
is like a second home to me.

11:14.542 --> 11:15.851
- Does he look more
- like you or Adam?

11:15.875 --> 11:16.917
He looks like Adam.

11:16.918 --> 11:17.958
Also for me,

11:18.000 --> 11:19.041
you know, most people, they work

11:19.042 --> 11:20.542
- and then they have
- a weekend at home.

11:20.543 --> 11:21.707
When you have your own business

11:21.708 --> 11:22.708
and the business

11:22.709 --> 11:23.709
is at your house,

11:23.750 --> 11:25.000
you're never not working.

11:25.042 --> 11:26.542
So for me to actually relax,

11:26.583 --> 11:28.792
I have to like, go out of town.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.125
- Ow, honey.
- [Inaudible]

11:30.167 --> 11:31.851
- Don't do that,
- I've gotta go to the bathroom.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.000
Ew.

11:33.001 --> 11:34.125

- It's right here.
- 445, right there.

11:45.545 --> 11:46.958
There it is.

11:50.875 --> 11:52.208
First of all,

11:52.250 --> 11:53.479
the architecture

11:53.480 --> 11:54.708
is trousdale-esque.

11:54.750 --> 11:55.916
Amazing.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.667
Come on, Adam joon.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.059
- Is Marty gonna be
- a partner too?

11:59.083 --> 12:01.542
Yeah, he's gonna be on title.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.416
While we're in palm Springs,

12:03.417 --> 12:04.417
we're going to look at

12:04.418 --> 12:05.417
a piece of property.

12:05.418 --> 12:06.875
The goal with this property

12:06.917 --> 12:08.083
is to buy something,

12:08.125 --> 12:09.917
rent it out and forget about it.

12:09.958 --> 12:11.667
Ooh, I like this landscaping.

12:11.708 --> 12:13.250
The landscaping is bomb.

12:13.292 --> 12:14.708
Bomb. Look at this view.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.146
Amazing.

12:16.147 --> 12:17.542
So far, really beautiful.

12:18.875 --> 12:20.042
Come on in.

12:20.043 --> 12:21.208
You guys, I'm excited.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.646
The more things that Adam

12:22.647 --> 12:24.042
and I do together

12:24.083 --> 12:25.750
to invest in our future,

12:25.792 --> 12:26.875
the better.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.208
Okay, this needs to go.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.250
- Could we look at it
- before we start saying

12:29.253 --> 12:30.393
- What we wanna change?
- Yeah.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.667
Okay, yes.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.917
I feel like I'm putting

12:32.958 --> 12:35.875
giant legos together of our life

12:35.917 --> 12:37.291
and it's super solid

12:37.292 --> 12:38.791
and reinforced with rebar

12:38.792 --> 12:41.458
and sh..., like, it's legit.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.624
Clearly, there was a sale

12:42.625 --> 12:44.791
somewhere with the marble.

12:44.792 --> 12:46.250
You guys, this floor...

12:46.292 --> 12:47.292
You guys, it's hideous.

12:47.293 --> 12:50.792
I can't at all.

12:50.833 --> 12:52.143
- Babe, do they fill
- this place up with water?

12:52.167 --> 12:53.792
- I think so.
- It's a Roman bathtub.

12:53.833 --> 12:55.292
- I feel like it's too dark.
- It's dark.

12:55.295 --> 12:56.375
They spent money,

12:56.417 --> 12:57.457
they did some things here.

12:57.458 --> 12:58.917
I wish they hadn't.

12:58.958 --> 12:59.958
Oh my god, you guys,

12:59.959 --> 13:00.958
standing here,

13:00.959 --> 13:03.458
there's one, two, there,

13:03.500 --> 13:04.624
four, five, six...

13:04.625 --> 13:05.709
You guys.

13:05.710 --> 13:06.791
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

13:06.792 --> 13:07.957
You guys.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.457
Oh, that's ugly.

13:09.458 --> 13:10.625
I need to cleanse

13:10.626 --> 13:11.791
my ocular area,

13:11.792 --> 13:12.834
like wash my eyes out

13:12.835 --> 13:13.875
with bleach.

13:13.917 --> 13:15.583
Rez, how much is this place?

13:15.625 --> 13:17.292
- 260.
- That's...

13:17.295 --> 13:18.792
- 260, Jesus.
- Yeah.

13:18.795 --> 13:20.292
But you guys,

13:20.293 --> 13:21.792
now I'm starting to feel guilty

13:21.833 --> 13:22.979
because what if this person

13:22.980 --> 13:24.125
couldn't see?

13:24.167 --> 13:25.667
Babe.

13:25.708 --> 13:27.666
Maybe this is because

13:27.667 --> 13:29.125
you are going like this

13:29.167 --> 13:30.500
- and you're hitting the wall.
- Rez.

13:30.503 --> 13:31.813
Having stone here

13:31.814 --> 13:33.125
protects the wall.

13:33.167 --> 13:34.896
There's no other reason

13:34.897 --> 13:36.625
to have stone.

13:36.667 --> 13:37.667
Look at the tiles,

13:37.668 --> 13:39.292
more tiles on the exterior.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.666
It can't be more tile,

13:40.667 --> 13:42.000
there's no way.

13:42.001 --> 13:43.332
Oh.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.500
I'm all about aesthetics

13:45.542 --> 13:47.833
and this place is so angry

13:47.875 --> 13:50.625
and volatile and aggressive

13:50.667 --> 13:51.792
with all of the finishes

13:51.833 --> 13:53.499
and nothing is cohesive.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.250
And my poor little

13:55.251 --> 13:56.999
gay heart is frowning

You guys, can we agree

14:02.042 --> 14:03.105
that these owners

14:03.106 --> 14:04.167

14:04.208 --> 14:07.167
No, or a tile fetish.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.271
I just need to get

14:08.272 --> 14:09.333
the f... out.

14:09.375 --> 14:10.500
This is not the investment

14:10.542 --> 14:11.625
I was looking for.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.374
This is such a travesty.

- Hi.

14:31.375 --> 14:33.374
What can I get you?

14:33.375 --> 14:34.708
- May I have a michelada,

Can I do two enchiladas?

You want steak?

- Yes, please.
- Okay.

And a side of jalapeños.

15:05.043 --> 15:06.375
Okay.

15:06.417 --> 15:07.417
- There's something
- I definitely wanna order

I haven't seen you

Yes.

How did you get

to where you were

15:22.980 --> 15:24.208
at the Mayan ruins?

15:24.250 --> 15:25.809
- What made it
- such a bad day that day?

15:25.833 --> 15:27.792
- Do you not remember
- how that happened

15:27.795 --> 15:29.792
- At the Mayan ruins?
- I saw a moment of rage.

- Why are you talking to nothing?
- It's going to my heart, ahh.

Why does it f... ing

15:39.751 --> 15:41.375
matter to him?

I don't really know

15:42.439 --> 15:43.458
anything anymore

15:43.500 --> 15:44.917
when it comes to Reza,

15:44.958 --> 15:46.188
but this whole obsession

15:46.189 --> 15:47.417
is very weird.

15:47.458 --> 15:49.625
- He's never come to a doctor's
- appointment with me

15:49.628 --> 15:50.750
In this last six years.

15:50.792 --> 15:52.309

- stick a needle

15:52.333 --> 15:53.583
In my stomach every week

15:53.625 --> 15:54.791
for the last six years.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.625
So how is he all of a sudden

15:56.667 --> 15:58.250
this big expert in my life

15:58.292 --> 15:59.875
and what's going on

15:59.876 --> 16:01.457

Oh, thank you.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.917
- Thank you.
- That looks really good.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.125
What he did in Belize

16:08.167 --> 16:09.584
was completely

16:09.585 --> 16:11.000
out of left field,

16:11.042 --> 16:12.166
the level he took it.

16:12.167 --> 16:13.917
- I agree, that was wrong.
- And so fast.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.000
- Jooneh-man.
- And you know what,

16:15.001 --> 16:16.001
He's not a man.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.667
- I swear, I probably pull
- his pants down,

16:17.670 --> 16:19.458
He has a bigger f... ing vagina

16:19.500 --> 16:21.167
- than the biggest prostitute
- I know.

16:21.170 --> 16:23.625
- Okay.
- So, Reza's a f... ing twat-ass

Pussy piece of sh...

16:24.792 --> 16:26.417
- I wanna know
- how you guys got there.

16:26.458 --> 16:27.666
He went in, went in, went in,

16:27.667 --> 16:28.999
went in, went in, went in,

16:29.000 --> 16:30.851
- and then when he decided
- to drop on the floor,

16:30.875 --> 16:32.000
- Talking about,
- "oh my god, I'm dying,

16:32.001 --> 16:33.001
"My hand, my hand."

16:33.042 --> 16:35.292
Then, yes, 100 percent.

16:35.333 --> 16:36.333
What am I supposed to do,

16:36.334 --> 16:38.018
- sit back like a f... ing
- pussy-ass bitch?

16:38.042 --> 16:39.500
- No.
- I will never be one of those.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.000
- I know you won't.
- Okay then,

16:41.003 --> 16:42.417
So who cares

16:42.418 --> 16:43.832
if I said some sh...?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.250
Why do you keep justifying

16:45.292 --> 16:46.333
- everything that he's doing?
- I'm not justifying him,

16:46.336 --> 16:47.375
I'm trying to help you.

16:47.417 --> 16:49.708
You have this wonderful ability

16:49.750 --> 16:51.875
of anybody saying anything

16:51.917 --> 16:53.059
that's not 100 percent positive,

16:53.083 --> 16:54.207
they're "talking sh..."

16:54.208 --> 16:55.500
He wasn't talking sh...,

16:55.542 --> 16:56.708
he was asking questions.

16:56.750 --> 16:57.833
It's difficult sometimes

16:57.875 --> 16:59.167
to tell you certain things

16:59.208 --> 17:00.771
because if you don't like

17:00.772 --> 17:02.333
where it's going,

17:02.375 --> 17:03.542
loch-nesa comes out.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.207
So what are you suggesting?

17:05.208 --> 17:06.393
Instead of coming in all hot

17:06.417 --> 17:07.625
and trying to fight,

17:07.667 --> 17:10.042
hear people out.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.000
- If you let somebody
- finish their sentence,

17:12.042 --> 17:13.625
It doesn't hurt.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.018
Sometimes I think shervin's

17:16.042 --> 17:17.667
so consumed with being

17:17.668 --> 17:19.292
the good guy,

17:19.333 --> 17:20.396
he forgets that

17:20.397 --> 17:21.458
I have every right

17:21.500 --> 17:22.833
to be upset right now.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.875
I tried to be the bigger person

17:23.876 --> 17:25.833
a couple times with Reza,

17:25.875 --> 17:28.333
it backfired in my face.

17:28.375 --> 17:29.542
Right now, I want nothing

17:29.543 --> 17:30.708
to do with Reza.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.500
I really don't give two f... s.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.542
- I assessed everything
- in my life

17:45.583 --> 17:47.101
- And I thought to myself,
- "what's important?"

- get your wife back.

- in our relationship

- yin and Yang.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.042

18:22.083 --> 18:23.124
it's the exact same thing.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.458
- Amazing.
- Go that way though.

- there's snakes out here.

- Honey.
- For Adam and Reza,

18:29.625 --> 18:30.625
I went to the restaurant

18:30.626 --> 18:31.792

18:31.833 --> 18:33.792
- that they actually
- got married in,

18:33.793 --> 18:34.809
And they have Marty with them

18:34.833 --> 18:35.976

- you know,

18:36.000 --> 18:37.375
It's the perfect setting.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.124
I want you guys to think about

18:39.125 --> 18:40.417
what you love about each other.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.958
- Don't mention it,
- just what's happening to you

18:41.961 --> 18:43.291
Is what I want.

18:43.292 --> 18:44.957
Alright, let's do it.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.792
- I'm really proud
- of the journey

18:46.795 --> 18:48.042
That I've taken

18:48.043 --> 18:49.292
to get to this place.

18:49.333 --> 18:52.292
Yes. Think about it hard.

18:52.333 --> 18:54.333
- Yes.
- Oh god, I look like a cow.

18:54.336 --> 18:56.166
No, you don't.

18:56.167 --> 18:58.000
- And after what happened
- last year,

18:58.042 --> 19:00.333
It has that much more meaning.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.000
Get into it from the inside.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.583
I'm very shocked

19:03.625 --> 19:05.332
that I'm loving marriage

19:05.333 --> 19:06.875
as much as I am.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.750
I love how you're carrying

19:09.751 --> 19:11.125
each other.

19:11.167 --> 19:12.351
- Growing up,
- I saw what it was like

19:12.375 --> 19:13.500
With my mom and dad,

19:13.542 --> 19:15.583
and I was so apprehensive

19:15.625 --> 19:16.999
and I've got my boy Mike

19:17.000 --> 19:18.584
telling me how hard

19:18.585 --> 19:20.166
the first year is.

19:20.167 --> 19:22.583
It's actually really great.

19:22.625 --> 19:24.166
I highly recommend it,

19:24.167 --> 19:25.999
get married.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.792
Tell them Reza sent you.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.250
Babe, I'm starving.

19:29.292 --> 19:30.833
- Sushi or thai?
- I'm tired.

Let's go. Woo.

[Music playing]

19:41.708 --> 19:42.708
- Hello.
- Hi babe.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.041
How you doing?

19:44.042 --> 19:45.042
Good, how are you?

19:45.083 --> 19:46.167
Good.

19:46.208 --> 19:47.208
Now you may have thought

19:47.209 --> 19:48.541
that my date with Annalise

19:48.542 --> 19:50.542
was like a terrible disaster.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.208
- You barely drink,
- doesn't cost much.

19:52.211 --> 19:53.875
- You definitely don't eat,
- doesn't cost much.

19:53.878 --> 19:55.708
- This is awesome.
- Perfect girl?

19:55.711 --> 19:57.000
Until you talked.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.229
But she wanted to see me

19:59.230 --> 20:00.374
again after.

20:00.375 --> 20:01.458
Shocker.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.208
- So wait, what time is it
- there right now?

20:03.211 --> 20:06.458
Like 12:30 in the afternoon.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.208
- The difficult part
- with Annalise and I is that

20:08.211 --> 20:09.958
She lives - across the globe,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.518
- But our conversations
- have definitely evolved

20:11.542 --> 20:12.792
Since our first date.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.375
- When you wake up in the morning
- and you see somebody,

20:14.378 --> 20:16.208
- Do you go like,
- "cheerio, governor?"

20:16.250 --> 20:18.749
That's a different country.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.979
You mustn't go on

20:19.980 --> 20:21.208
a lot of dates, do you?

20:21.250 --> 20:23.083
- You can tell, huh?
- Yeah.

20:23.086 --> 20:24.518
- We hung out a few times
- while she was still here

20:24.542 --> 20:25.833
In the states

20:25.875 --> 20:27.416

20:27.417 --> 20:28.582
we've chatted on the phone,

20:28.583 --> 20:29.750
we text back and forth,

20:29.792 --> 20:31.188
we've had some facetime

20:31.189 --> 20:32.583
conversations

20:32.625 --> 20:34.167
and getting to know each other.

20:34.208 --> 20:35.416
I like your face.

20:35.417 --> 20:36.959
And you like it

20:36.960 --> 20:38.500
when I talk sometimes right?

20:38.542 --> 20:39.893
- You know,
- you're taking notes, I see.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.042
That's good.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.167
- I'm learning.
- You are, you're learning.

As you learn from me.

If I didn't think Annalise

20:49.417 --> 20:51.000
- had the opportunity
- to be the one,

20:56.917 --> 20:58.792
- when you flush,
- that's how far she is.

20:58.795 --> 21:00.208
I don't know where it's gonna go

21:00.250 --> 21:01.791
but I'm excited.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.125
- So, I've been meaning
- to tell you,

21:03.128 --> 21:04.542
So Asa gave me, like,

21:04.583 --> 21:05.625
- some sneak peeks
- at some of the pics

21:05.628 --> 21:06.750
She took of us.

21:06.792 --> 21:07.958
- They came out pretty cool.
- Okay, yeah.

21:07.961 --> 21:09.124
They came out pretty cool.

21:09.125 --> 21:11.124
Asa's message in her art show

21:11.125 --> 21:12.457
is people at different stages

21:12.458 --> 21:13.624
of their relationship.

21:13.625 --> 21:14.792
- And it's gonna be
- very interesting

21:14.795 --> 21:16.250
- To see her parents'
- relationship,

21:16.292 --> 21:17.875
Almost five decades deep,

21:17.917 --> 21:19.292
- all the way down
- to me and Annalise,

21:19.295 --> 21:20.457
Just a few months.

21:20.458 --> 21:21.809
- So, are you gonna
- come out here soon

21:21.833 --> 21:23.624
For her viewing thing?

21:23.625 --> 21:25.559
- You've gotta see these pictures,
- they're great.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.624
Yeah, I should be there.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.601
- I'll let you get back to work.
- I just wanted to say hi.

21:29.625 --> 21:30.625
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

21:30.628 --> 21:32.021
Bye bye.

21:32.022 --> 21:33.417
Bye bye.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.417
[Music playing]

21:52.833 --> 21:54.000
- Hey babe.
- Asi.

21:54.003 --> 21:55.667
[Speaking farsi] Mikey.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.667
- Good [Inaudible]
- [Inaudible]

21:57.670 --> 21:59.101
- Grab a seat, please.
- What are you doing?

21:59.125 --> 22:01.167
- Just working a little bit.
- How are you?

22:01.170 --> 22:05.499
Good, just exhausted as usual.

22:05.500 --> 22:07.958
- I mean, you have a lot riding
- on the kaftans,

22:08.000 --> 22:09.084
You've got a lot riding

22:09.085 --> 22:10.166
on this exhibit

22:10.167 --> 22:11.333
that you're doing.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.667
It's a lot of work.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.167
- What about you?
- I wanna show you something.

22:14.170 --> 22:15.500
Okay.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.643
- Fo sho.
- Oh my god, it's the shoes?

22:16.667 --> 22:17.667
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.750
I gotta show you what

22:18.792 --> 22:20.583
I've been cooking up in the lab.

22:20.625 --> 22:21.708
So, this is my chukka.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.208
- Oh, I like that, Mike.
- Yeah.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.458
- Nice.
- Premium leathers.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.708
- It's a blessing that a major
- retailer

22:26.750 --> 22:27.958
Has decided to place an order

22:28.000 --> 22:29.292
with a brand new shoe company.

22:29.333 --> 22:30.521
This looks like

22:30.522 --> 22:31.707
an upscale sneaker.

22:31.708 --> 22:33.292
I don't wanna f... this up,

22:33.333 --> 22:34.708
so me and my team

22:34.750 --> 22:35.874
are working around the clock.

22:35.875 --> 22:37.875
We put the heat on everybody,

22:37.917 --> 22:40.041
from the graphic designer

22:40.042 --> 22:41.541
down to the f... ing

22:41.542 --> 22:43.042
manufacturer in Mexico.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.309
- Oh, I like those.
- Yeah, these are dope.

22:44.333 --> 22:46.000
- I'm gonna get some
- for Jermaine.

22:46.042 --> 22:47.393
- Absolutely.
- Anything to make sure

22:47.417 --> 22:48.875
We reach the deadline

22:48.917 --> 22:50.292
they've put on us

22:50.333 --> 22:52.833
- to do the launch
- and have the shoes in the store.

22:52.875 --> 22:54.875
- [Speaking hebrew]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.018
- It's exciting, man.
- Thank you.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.143
- What else is up?
- It's hard.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.559
- I went to temple today,
- I haven't been to temple

22:58.583 --> 22:59.726
In I don't know how many months.

22:59.750 --> 23:00.833
I love the spiritual

23:00.875 --> 23:02.292
revolution you're having.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.396
I assessed everything

23:03.397 --> 23:04.458
in my life

23:05.750 --> 23:07.268
- and I thought to myself,
- "what's important

23:07.292 --> 23:08.396
And what do I need

23:08.397 --> 23:09.500
"to really focus on?"

23:09.542 --> 23:11.417
- Babe, you've gotta go
- get your wife back.

23:11.420 --> 23:12.749
You've just gotta do it.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.000
Yeah.

23:14.001 --> 23:15.249
Take all of this right now,

23:15.250 --> 23:16.542
this wisdom you have going on,

23:16.543 --> 23:17.833
this amazing growth.

23:17.875 --> 23:19.250
- Mm-hmm.
- You've really changed.

23:19.251 --> 23:20.251
I'm really trying.

23:20.292 --> 23:21.582
Just bring this to her,

23:21.583 --> 23:22.917
like, "this is me"

23:22.958 --> 23:24.354
and I get it."

23:24.355 --> 23:25.749
Mm-hmm.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.000
Yeah, I was gonna write her

23:27.001 --> 23:28.250
an email

23:28.292 --> 23:30.249
so I can meet with her and,

23:30.250 --> 23:32.083
- you know, kind of
- just lay it out there,

23:32.086 --> 23:33.167
Like you said,

23:33.168 --> 23:34.249
just give her all of me,

23:34.250 --> 23:35.729
like, what you see before you

23:35.730 --> 23:37.208
is a changed man.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.582
I just got goosebumps, Mike.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.417
- Mm-hmm.
- That's amazing.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.000
Let's write it.

23:42.042 --> 23:43.500
I've called her,

23:43.542 --> 23:45.042
she's blocked my calls.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.083
I've sent her flowers,

23:47.125 --> 23:48.792
no response.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.291
She's judging me

23:53.292 --> 23:54.792
on the man I once was

23:54.833 --> 23:56.542
- and not the man
- that I've become.

23:56.583 --> 23:57.729
I'm a man who's learned

23:57.730 --> 23:58.875
from his mistakes.

23:58.917 --> 24:01.375
I've heard people say

24:01.417 --> 24:02.605
my life is empty

24:02.606 --> 24:03.791
and meaningless,

24:03.792 --> 24:04.896
I never understood

24:04.897 --> 24:06.000
what the f... that meant.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.125
Because I've always been

24:08.126 --> 24:09.125
so cocky

24:09.126 --> 24:11.125
- and like, "oh,
- I don't need anyone."

24:11.167 --> 24:13.125
- No, not you.
- It's just me.

24:13.128 --> 24:14.292
This Belize trip

24:14.293 --> 24:15.458
was very difficult for Mike.

24:15.500 --> 24:16.709
I think Mike is somebody

24:16.710 --> 24:17.917
who hasn't really faced

24:17.958 --> 24:19.125
those sides of him

24:19.126 --> 24:20.292
ever, probably.

24:21.458 --> 24:23.021
I made mistakes.

24:23.022 --> 24:24.583
I was a bad husband.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.084
What he did was wrong

24:27.085 --> 24:28.167
and he knows it.

24:28.208 --> 24:29.438
Now we can start

24:29.439 --> 24:30.666
the healing process.

24:30.667 --> 24:32.666
Do you write "dear Jessica"

24:32.667 --> 24:34.166
or "dear my love"

24:34.167 --> 24:36.250
or what do you write?

24:36.292 --> 24:38.500
I don't know.

24:38.542 --> 24:39.917
Mikey.

24:44.625 --> 24:46.166
What about something like this,

24:46.167 --> 24:48.667
"I need to see you in person,"

24:48.708 --> 24:49.833
there are so many things

24:49.834 --> 24:50.958
I wanna tell you.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.167
I would be honored

24:52.168 --> 24:53.333
if you would meet me.

24:53.375 --> 24:54.604
"Love you, Michael."

24:54.605 --> 24:55.833
Mm-hmm.

24:58.542 --> 25:00.750
I feel like I failed her,

25:00.792 --> 25:02.833
myself, our families.

25:02.875 --> 25:04.667
- Four and a half years
- we were together.

25:04.708 --> 25:07.832
You share some of the brightest

25:07.833 --> 25:09.292
moments of your life

25:11.042 --> 25:12.542
and you help each other

25:12.543 --> 25:14.041
build and grow.

25:14.042 --> 25:15.417
I love you.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.041
Will you marry me?

25:19.042 --> 25:20.125
What?

25:20.167 --> 25:21.375
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

25:21.378 --> 25:22.792
I love you.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.207
Woo.

25:24.208 --> 25:25.958
Oh my god,

25:25.959 --> 25:27.708
I'm gonna be a wife.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.374
I have a brand new outlook

25:30.375 --> 25:31.707
on life again,

25:31.708 --> 25:32.958
and I've realized

25:32.959 --> 25:34.207
how much I would Cherish

25:34.208 --> 25:35.458
this person if she was back

25:35.459 --> 25:36.707
in my life again.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.375
- And I wish she would give me
- the chance

25:38.378 --> 25:40.000
To show her who I've become.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.208
When you see her,

25:43.250 --> 25:45.208
- you have to start it
- by being like,

25:45.250 --> 25:47.292
- Tell her everything
- you've learned in this time,

25:47.333 --> 25:48.792
- What you're telling me.
- Mm-hmm.

25:48.833 --> 25:50.417
She needs to hear that.

25:50.458 --> 25:52.292
I really love her.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.750
- Coming up...
- You know what, let's call her.

25:58.753 --> 26:00.375
- Yeah.
- Mj and I have been hearing

26:00.417 --> 26:01.750
Rumors about Jessica.

26:01.792 --> 26:02.875
- It's like...
- Oh my god,

26:02.917 --> 26:05.583
What? Oh my god.

26:25.417 --> 26:26.542
Hi.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.854
Rez.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.124
Babe, I don't feel so hot.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.291
Rez, you look really good.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.917
I don't feel good.

26:34.958 --> 26:36.583
It takes a lot to get me out

26:36.625 --> 26:37.957
of the house when I'm sick,

26:37.958 --> 26:39.292
but I've got two

26:39.293 --> 26:40.625
of my favorite things,

26:40.667 --> 26:43.417
mj and sprinkles.

26:43.458 --> 26:44.958
So, I'll have a hot mint tea

26:45.000 --> 26:46.125
- whenever and which kind
- do you want?

26:46.128 --> 26:47.457
Two. Yeah.

26:47.458 --> 26:48.458
I want something

26:48.459 --> 26:49.708
with a red velvet cupcake

26:49.709 --> 26:50.957
on top.

26:50.958 --> 26:52.101
- You wanna do red velvet
- ice cream too?

26:52.125 --> 26:53.375
- Sure.
- Cool. I'll make that

26:53.417 --> 26:54.458
- For you guys and - I'll bring it out.
- Thank you.

26:54.461 --> 26:56.291
Banana and a chocolate.

26:56.292 --> 26:57.958
- Half and half,
- dark chocolate, banana?

26:57.961 --> 26:59.708
Yes.

26:59.709 --> 27:01.457
Cool, you got it.

27:01.458 --> 27:02.771
How's Adam?

27:02.772 --> 27:04.083
Adam is fantastic.

27:04.125 --> 27:06.125
I have his back, he has my back,

27:06.167 --> 27:07.396
like, you know,

27:07.397 --> 27:08.625
for the rest of our lives.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.125
Like, he is dependent on me

27:10.167 --> 27:12.083
and I am dependent on him.

27:12.125 --> 27:14.166
But I don't know if I'm like,

27:14.167 --> 27:16.999
caveman, but I definitely

27:17.000 --> 27:19.292
am not 100 percent comfortable

27:19.333 --> 27:20.500
with the word "husband."

27:20.542 --> 27:22.000
I'm not used to that word.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.999
First of all, I think

27:24.000 --> 27:25.667
you have a lot

27:25.708 --> 27:27.500
of that old school

27:27.542 --> 27:29.166
masculine persian energy,

27:29.167 --> 27:32.292
and that's part of who you are.

27:32.333 --> 27:33.500
- That's my hangup, 100 percent.
- That's a negative stereotype

27:33.503 --> 27:35.167
- That you have.
- It's my hangup, yeah.

27:35.208 --> 27:36.666
What is the phrase

27:36.667 --> 27:37.851
- that you are comfortable
- with that you do...

27:37.875 --> 27:39.333
- My partner.
- Partner.

27:39.375 --> 27:41.125
- That's my man.
- That's very white,

27:41.167 --> 27:42.250
That's also very American.

27:42.292 --> 27:43.333
- Over here.
- Alright, pardon me, guys.

27:43.334 --> 27:44.351
- Oh, thank you.
- There's your sundae.

27:44.375 --> 27:45.500
- Thank you.
- No problem.

27:45.542 --> 27:46.667
- There's your ice cream half
- and half.

27:46.670 --> 27:47.768
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, no problem.

27:47.792 --> 27:48.833
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you. Oops.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.625
Thank you very, very much.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.084
By the way, when I went

27:52.085 --> 27:53.499
to take my cousin out

27:53.500 --> 27:54.667
to look at houses,

27:54.708 --> 27:56.541
he's like, "I see Jessica"

27:56.542 --> 27:58.541
at toca madera on the regular

27:58.542 --> 28:00.021
with no ring on,

28:00.022 --> 28:01.500
"looking fine as f..."

28:01.542 --> 28:03.333
Titties out, smokey eyes,

28:03.375 --> 28:05.207
coochie cutters, like,

28:05.208 --> 28:07.042
having a good old time.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.708
La is a big place,

28:08.750 --> 28:10.542
but the persian grapevine

28:10.583 --> 28:13.041
is strong and long,

28:13.042 --> 28:14.459
and I've been hearing rumors

28:14.460 --> 28:15.874
about Jessica.

28:15.875 --> 28:17.059
You know what, let's call her.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.541
Yeah.

28:18.542 --> 28:19.688
The number you've dialed

36:36.022 --> 36:37.167
make it big time.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.875
- I saw the shoes,
- they're really cool.

36:38.878 --> 36:40.374
I saw the samples.

36:40.375 --> 36:41.667
- They look nice.
- Yeah,

36:41.708 --> 36:42.874
You might have to try on a pair.

36:42.875 --> 36:44.018
- Of course, probably.
- Right?

36:44.042 --> 36:45.459
Yeah.

Hi guys, what up?

36:53.042 --> 36:54.042
This jumpsuit is...

36:54.043 --> 36:55.042
When did you come to my

36:55.043 --> 36:56.125
house and steal it?

36:56.126 --> 36:57.208
I've had it for like
a million years.

36:57.250 --> 36:58.750
- Isn't it cute?
- No, it's mine.

36:58.753 --> 37:00.583
- Hi.
- Promise me you'll take it off

37:00.625 --> 37:01.768

- "fashionably late"

37:16.875 --> 37:18.018
- Because...?

- am I supposed to tell them?

37:37.125 --> 37:38.875
Just that we'll be there soon.

37:38.917 --> 37:40.624
Sucks. People are texting me

37:40.625 --> 37:42.268
- and I'm not texting them back
- because the one thing

37:42.292 --> 37:43.624
I'm gonna say is just rude,

37:43.625 --> 37:44.625
mean sh...,

38:31.708 --> 38:32.832
We got married

38:32.833 --> 38:34.167

38:34.168 --> 38:35.500
a conscious decision

38:35.542 --> 38:37.833
- that we wanna
- surround ourselves with people

- That are doing great things

- and told me that

The shoes are being held

40:30.980 --> 40:32.124
in customs.
