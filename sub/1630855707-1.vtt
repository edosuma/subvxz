00:17.267 --> 00:19.811
<i>Again, a larger ship has arrived.</i>

00:19.811 --> 00:23.982
<i>Today marks the fourth month
since the aliens invaded our world.</i>

00:24.733 --> 00:28.529
<i>Four long months.
The hardest our world has ever known.</i>

00:28.529 --> 00:31.949
<i>We have suffered.
We have sacrificed lives,</i>

00:31.949 --> 00:34.409
<i>land, loved ones.</i>

00:35.994 --> 00:40.207
<i>And yet, with millions gone,
we here at the World Defense Coalition</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:44.628
<i>are fighting for you every day
with every resource of every nation.</i>

00:44.628 --> 00:49.758
<i>We are doing everything we can
to understand and overcome our enemy.</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:54.805
<i>We ask for your help.
Please cooperate with the military,</i>

00:54.805 --> 00:57.850
<i>comply with all codes,
and evacuate contaminated areas.</i>

00:58.433 --> 01:02.729
<i>The alien spores have now infected the air
in over 30% of our planet.</i>

01:02.729 --> 01:06.316
<i>We have set up shelter for refugees
from all infected areas.</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:13.073
<i>We are working together, one world,
one coalition, to bring you to safety.</i>

01:13.073 --> 01:15.367
<i>Together, we will win this war.</i>

01:16.034 --> 01:19.204
<i>Together, we will see the other side
of these dark days.</i>

01:20.247 --> 01:24.459
<i>And when that sun rises
on a sky free from our invaders,</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:29.131
<i>it will be the brightest day
our species has ever known.</i>

02:40.994 --> 02:44.039
Run! Run!

04:17.757 --> 04:20.385
Don't worry,
we are going to find your mama.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.298
WDC, World Defense?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.883
You're with the Coalition? Government?

04:59.883 --> 05:01.260
Mitsuki Yamato?

05:01.802 --> 05:02.928
There are people here in trouble.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.179
We're not here for them.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.055
Let go of me!

05:05.055 --> 05:06.098
What are you saying?

05:06.098 --> 05:08.767
Let me go! What are you doing?

05:09.101 --> 05:11.270
Let me go! What are you doing?

05:11.270 --> 05:13.021
We need to help everyone!

05:13.021 --> 05:17.109
You're the Government! Help everyone!
What are you doing?

05:17.109 --> 05:18.902
Let me go!

05:20.153 --> 05:21.655
Let me go!

05:30.122 --> 05:31.164
Let me down!

05:31.164 --> 05:33.792
Let go of me. Let go of me!

05:35.377 --> 05:36.753
Let me down, let me down.

05:36.753 --> 05:37.754
Let go of me.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.840
- We have orders--
- People are dying!

05:39.840 --> 05:41.758
- I understand.
- I have to help them.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.844
We are losing this war.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.304
Let me down.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.930
Let me down, people are in trouble
and need our help.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.017
We're taking you somewhere
that could help us win...

05:53.353 --> 05:56.273
...somewhere you could save everyone.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.822
Let go of me. Let go of me.

06:14.666 --> 06:17.127
Where are we going?

07:35.205 --> 07:38.834
<i>...attacks in India
are now spreading west into Pakistan,</i>

07:38.834 --> 07:41.461
<i>creating a refugee crisis
that aid groups are calling</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:43.797
<i>the worst of the invasion thus far.</i>

07:44.381 --> 07:46.800
<i>The World Defense Coalition
is reporting ammonia levels</i>

07:46.800 --> 07:49.761
<i>rising at an alarming rate
round the atmosphere,</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:52.681
<i>with some areas approaching
200 parts per million.</i>

07:52.681 --> 07:54.850
<i>Supporters from the fringe group,
the Movement,</i>

07:54.850 --> 07:57.561
<i>have continued to cause problems
for the Coalition.</i>

07:57.561 --> 08:01.190
<i>This morning, a supply convoy
was ambushed and stripped of rations</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:04.526
<i>while headed for a survivor's camp
in the... region.</i>

08:04.526 --> 08:07.404
- Raids of this nature have increased...
- Do you have any candy?

08:07.404 --> 08:09.698
- ...the food shortage continues to worsen...
- What?

08:09.698 --> 08:12.034
Jell-O? Any ice cream?

08:12.034 --> 08:16.455
Kid, we barely have food.
We stopped getting ice a month ago.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.332
<i>...make their way to the nearest camp.</i>

08:33.013 --> 08:36.433
Okay, then what about stuffed animals?

08:36.433 --> 08:39.727
Like a teddy bear?
It doesn't even have to be a bear.

08:39.727 --> 08:44.149
It can be an otter, a seal,
a rabbit on a key chain--

08:44.149 --> 08:46.485
Hey. Who brought you here?

08:46.485 --> 08:48.820
My mommy. She's in the bathroom.

08:50.989 --> 08:51.990
Bathroom?

09:03.627 --> 09:05.420
You need a key for the bathroom.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.506
You wait right there.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.718
<i>...Dubai and Santiago
remain largely untouched at this time,</i>

09:11.718 --> 09:14.054
<i>suggesting that climate
and terrain may play a role.</i>

09:14.054 --> 09:15.430
Luke, we gotta go.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.354
- Hey!
- Seventeen, sixteen...

09:31.363 --> 09:32.906
Twelve, eleven,

09:32.906 --> 09:34.658
ten, nine...

09:34.658 --> 09:37.411
Hey! You, out there!

09:38.579 --> 09:40.414
Eight, seven...

09:42.124 --> 09:44.376
- Where's Luke?
- He was right behind me.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.300
- Open the damn door!
- Where's your brother?

09:59.183 --> 10:02.477
Open the damn door!

10:22.247 --> 10:25.959
- Luke, what happened to you? Are you okay?
- Mom, I got tools. Look.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.836
Luke, you know the rules.

10:27.836 --> 10:31.089
The moment they move for the door,
you have 17 seconds to get out.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.382
You took more than 30.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.302
You could have died in those seconds.
All of us could have.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.553
But we didn't, okay?

10:36.553 --> 10:39.097
- And we need these.
- Luke, you know the rules!

10:39.097 --> 10:40.807
Seventeen seconds!

10:41.475 --> 10:42.476
Yeah.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.230
I know the rules.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.272
We're almost there.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.029
It's their ship,

11:38.532 --> 11:41.326
the one we shot out of the sky...

11:45.831 --> 11:48.125
I know what it is.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.795
She's coming, Madam President.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.213
<i>Well, I hope you're right this time.</i>

11:53.213 --> 11:55.132
<i>We've had that ship
for nearly four months now.</i>

11:55.132 --> 11:56.884
<i>And if you can't provide progress fast,</i>

11:56.884 --> 11:58.760
<i>the Coalition will have
to take over the operation.</i>

11:58.760 --> 12:02.472
Might I remind you there wouldn't
be an operation without my funding.

12:02.472 --> 12:06.685
So, technically, it belongs to me,
not some United Nations knockoff.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.188
<i>This is not
one of your expensive toys, Nikhil.</i>

12:09.188 --> 12:12.065
<i>And I'm telling you
what the world leaders are telling me.</i>

12:12.065 --> 12:13.192
<i>We need results.</i>

12:13.192 --> 12:16.320
That map was nearly 80% green last week.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.946
Now we're clinging to 75.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.781
There are dead zones
across whole countries.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.075
<i>At this rate, they would have terraformed
our atmosphere in--</i>

12:22.075 --> 12:23.827
Yeah, I can do the math, Madam President.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.873
And you can tell the rest of your leaders
that results are on the way.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.208
Bye-bye.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.281
This way, please.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.918
Welcome, welcome.

13:12.918 --> 13:15.754
I can't tell you how excited I am
to finally have you here.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.964
You speak English, yes?

13:17.464 --> 13:20.175
You know, we've been trying
to track you down for over a month.

13:20.175 --> 13:24.513
We thought we had you in Kanazawa, but--
You were gone by the time we got there.

13:24.513 --> 13:27.182
Everyone was gone. Everyone but them.

13:27.182 --> 13:30.185
Right. Right. Would you like a drink?
Something to eat?

13:30.185 --> 13:33.564
I have a fabulous chef. He can do Asian.
He can do anything.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.440
What the hell am I doing here?

13:35.440 --> 13:37.568
Oh. Straight to business.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.027
I like it. Okay.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.281
Let's get the pleasantries
out of the way, shall we?

13:43.615 --> 13:44.783
My name is Nikhil Kapur.

13:44.783 --> 13:45.868
I know who you are.

13:47.703 --> 13:48.912
Everyone knows who you are.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.623
Right. Right.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.418
Sometimes I forget
there was a world before all this.

13:55.419 --> 13:56.587
Actually, I never forget.

13:56.587 --> 13:58.088
I was just being humble there.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.508
But we don't have time
for false modesty, do we?

14:02.009 --> 14:05.387
You're here because that is here.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.432
And that is here because of you.

14:09.183 --> 14:11.560
It was your codes that made contact
with that ship.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.772
The only communication anyone has made
with the enemy.

14:17.149 --> 14:19.067
Your coordinates made it possible to

14:20.194 --> 14:22.029
shoot that ship out of the sky.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.700
You gave us the only win of this war.

14:29.995 --> 14:30.996
It wasn't a win.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.082
It only made things worse.

14:37.461 --> 14:40.589
Did you bring me halfway across the world
to look at a dead ship?

14:44.301 --> 14:45.469
Is that what you think?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.056
It's dead?

14:51.183 --> 14:52.643
You communicated with it before.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.604
We want you to communicate with it again.

14:57.314 --> 14:58.315
We've tried.

14:58.315 --> 15:02.236
Had some of the world's greatest minds
in and out of it.

15:02.236 --> 15:05.864
And still, there's only one person
who's ever made contact.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.742
You.

15:11.119 --> 15:15.624
Contact. Communication. Connection.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.710
It's the only chance we'll have
to learn what they want.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.379
Why they're here.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.464
And how to stop them?

15:26.301 --> 15:30.055
The last time I worked with the military,
they lied to me.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.099
They used me.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.686
Why should I trust you?

15:36.186 --> 15:39.398
Because I'm not the military,
and I don't trust them either.

15:40.691 --> 15:43.735
I've worked outside the system
my whole life,

15:43.735 --> 15:46.947
and the only rule I've ever followed is...

15:49.074 --> 15:50.868
"Make sure you're always breaking one."

15:58.208 --> 16:00.878
What did you mean
when you said it's not dead?

16:03.255 --> 16:04.631
Go inside. See for yourself.

16:05.549 --> 16:07.843
We'll just need to run a few tests
on you first.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.636
- What kind of tests?
- Just standard.

16:09.636 --> 16:13.265
To baseline your psychology-- physiology--
in case something happens.

16:13.265 --> 16:16.101
It's a formality, really,
for your own safety.

16:18.979 --> 16:19.980
What's in there?

16:22.357 --> 16:25.611
Well, if you can answer that question,
Mitsuki Yamato,

16:26.570 --> 16:29.615
we might actually have a chance
to win this war.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.508
Guys, guys. What are you doing?
I said to pack up. Come on!

16:47.508 --> 16:50.844
I like it here.
We had running water for once.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.639
And mattresses,
even if they're a little stinky.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.599
It's two votes to one. We stay.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.684
I'm your mother. It's not a democracy.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.563
It hasn't even been 48 hours yet.
You're not playing by your own rules.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.983
We can't stay because you broke the rules.
It's too dangerous now.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.319
What if that man at the station
called the authorities?

17:07.319 --> 17:09.988
What if there are people looking for us?
We have to keep moving.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.656
I'm sick of running all the time.

17:11.656 --> 17:14.034
If we go any further,
we're going to drive into the ocean.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.662
We're done heading west. We go north now,

17:16.662 --> 17:19.830
to the top of the continent,
as far as the roads will take us.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.084
Nobody lives that far,
even before the invasion.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.252
Exactly. That's the point.
We will be safe.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.797
From aliens or humans?

17:33.220 --> 17:35.556
It wasn't aliens who took your father.

17:36.348 --> 17:39.685
Please, pack your things. Come on.

17:56.702 --> 17:57.703
Shit.

17:58.829 --> 17:59.997
Looking for this?

18:03.375 --> 18:06.044
You know we don't expose that, ever.

18:07.212 --> 18:09.131
Luke, give it to me.

18:09.131 --> 18:12.259
I was the one who found it.
It'll keep us safe so we can stay here.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.386
I am the one who keeps us safe, Luke.

18:14.386 --> 18:18.015
Luke, I said give it to me.
Luke, you need to trust me.

18:18.015 --> 18:20.058
- You need to trust--
- Your little voice inside?

18:20.058 --> 18:23.020
That little voice inside has kept us alive
this whole time.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.564
The whole world out there
is falling apart.

18:25.564 --> 18:27.858
You, your sister,
this family is my whole world.

18:27.858 --> 18:30.402
I would do anything and everything
to hold it together.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.863
You know, I have a voice inside too.
Shouldn't that count?

18:32.863 --> 18:34.198
Yes, it should. It should.

18:34.198 --> 18:37.409
When your little voice knows how to drive,
how to cross-stitch a wound in the dark,

18:37.409 --> 18:40.871
how to make a meal out of ration scraps,
how to take care of your sister.

18:42.664 --> 18:46.919
I'm not only protecting you.
I am preparing you, in case...

18:46.919 --> 18:48.003
In case what?

18:49.004 --> 18:54.468
Luke, just give it to her. I wanna go now.
Okay? So that's two votes to one.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.556
What if I wanna stay here on my own?

18:59.556 --> 19:01.850
This is not an option.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.520
Where you go, I go. Where I go, you go.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.022
We go together. This is our first rule.

19:22.538 --> 19:23.622
Thank you.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.045
Come here. Come here.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.346
What are you measuring?

19:40.138 --> 19:42.975
The EEG read is the summation
of the excitatory

19:42.975 --> 19:46.478
and inhibitory potentials
and their constant change.

19:47.062 --> 19:48.063
Are you a doctor?

19:48.605 --> 19:50.148
Cognitive scientist.

19:50.148 --> 19:52.442
I'll answer all your questions
after the test.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.029
Endō Shūsaku.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.615
Enchi Fumiko.

20:00.868 --> 20:04.121
Callas. Clinton.

20:04.121 --> 20:06.498
At what age
did you finish graduate school?

20:06.498 --> 20:08.000
Twenty-two.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.252
The Kremlin.

20:12.171 --> 20:13.172
Mandela.

20:17.009 --> 20:18.510
I don't know what that is.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.596
First time you fell in love?

20:24.892 --> 20:26.310
First time you fell in love?

20:28.145 --> 20:29.146
Three years ago.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.690
Name of your first love?

20:34.735 --> 20:36.862
- You need to tell me the person's name.
- Why?

20:37.613 --> 20:39.323
We're creating a memory baseline.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.407
Why?

20:40.991 --> 20:42.159
I'll explain later.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.661
What was their name?

20:48.290 --> 20:49.291
Hinata.

20:50.417 --> 20:51.710
Is Hinata back in Japan?

20:52.211 --> 20:53.212
No.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.592
Imagine that's your daughter.

20:58.592 --> 21:00.302
Life or death situation.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.932
If you had to save her or Hinata,
who would you choose?

21:05.891 --> 21:07.935
Your lover or the baby?

21:09.811 --> 21:10.812
Lover.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.902
These are sounds recorded
during the collapse of a building.

21:16.902 --> 21:20.322
If you had to save your lover
or your parents, who would you choose?

21:21.532 --> 21:22.533
Lover.

21:24.326 --> 21:27.204
- A line of innocent people--
- Lover. Can we move on?

21:33.210 --> 21:36.380
- Who's with you in the picture?
- My first college roommate.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.048
Ichiko.

21:53.939 --> 21:56.108
That Hinata?

21:58.193 --> 21:59.444
The astronaut?

22:00.028 --> 22:02.990
Is she the reason you were trying
to make contact with the craft?

22:06.368 --> 22:07.870
- Is she the reason you were--
- Yes.

22:08.537 --> 22:10.831
Did you believe Hinata was alive
on that ship?

22:10.831 --> 22:11.999
What is the point of this?

22:11.999 --> 22:14.918
Do you feel like you were responsible
for killing Hinata

22:14.918 --> 22:16.920
when that ship was shot out of the sky?

22:20.757 --> 22:24.178
- Do you hold yourself responsible--
- I heard the question. What is your point?

22:24.178 --> 22:26.930
- Do you hold yourself responsible--
- This has nothing to do with--

22:26.930 --> 22:28.390
I need you to answer the question.

22:28.390 --> 22:32.019
Do you hold yourself responsible
for the death of Hinata Murai?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.605
Fuck you.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.523
Is that your answer?

23:28.784 --> 23:30.035
"Almond."

23:36.667 --> 23:39.044
That's our key word
for when you're in danger.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.552
I don't wanna learn any more Farsi.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.345
We didn't have to before.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.138
- We have to now.
- Why?

23:50.764 --> 23:52.391
It may save our lives one day.

23:56.436 --> 23:57.437
I'm not good at it.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.525
That's why you practice.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.239
That's it.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.120
Okay.

24:13.120 --> 24:16.290
I'm going to go inside and ask them
where the next gas station is.

24:16.290 --> 24:17.708
You guys stay here, okay?

24:17.708 --> 24:19.126
I'm hungry, Mommy.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.669
I'll ask if they have food.

24:22.087 --> 24:23.797
Or we could ask them for some.

24:33.182 --> 24:35.809
We stay away from the military.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.061
- You know the--
- The rules.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.105
Yeah.

24:44.109 --> 24:45.110
Who do we have?

24:46.528 --> 24:47.529
Each other.

24:48.780 --> 24:49.781
What do we need?

24:49.781 --> 24:51.533
- Nothing else.
- Nothing else.

24:51.533 --> 24:52.618
That's it.

24:53.452 --> 24:54.453
Okay.

24:57.331 --> 24:58.749
I'll be right back.

25:31.865 --> 25:32.866
Petrol.

25:35.077 --> 25:36.078
That's gas.

25:40.832 --> 25:43.752
Let's play a game. I spy.

25:44.920 --> 25:48.715
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with a G?

25:49.716 --> 25:51.802
Luke, don't go, please.

25:51.802 --> 25:52.886
I'll be right back.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.306
- Mom said stay with--
- I heard her, Sarah.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.268
I promise I'll be right back.

26:24.334 --> 26:26.670
- Hey. Who wants another one?
- I'll take one.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.924
Now. Go now.

27:46.208 --> 27:48.126
Hey, kid! What are you doing with that?

28:00.264 --> 28:01.265
Mom.

28:03.559 --> 28:04.560
Mom.

28:12.526 --> 28:13.944
- Hey, hello.
- Mommy, don't go!

28:13.944 --> 28:15.946
Excuse me. I'm-- I'm his mother.

28:15.946 --> 28:18.198
We just ran out of gas.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.450
I went to the store
to ask for the next gas station.

28:20.450 --> 28:26.290
And he clearly did something desperate
and stupid, but he's just a kid

28:26.290 --> 28:27.791
and we're a long way from home.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.043
Sam, put the cans down.

28:31.545 --> 28:34.882
Give them back to these good people
that are keeping us safe

28:34.882 --> 28:36.216
and say you're sorry.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.301
I'm sorry.

28:37.301 --> 28:38.802
You see, he's sorry.

28:39.553 --> 28:44.099
Kids make mistakes, but I assure you,
he's not going to make this one again.

28:44.099 --> 28:46.560
You wouldn't happen
to be with the Movement, would you?

28:47.060 --> 28:48.145
The what?

28:48.645 --> 28:52.274
I don't know what you're talking about.
We're a family. He's just a child.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.776
Then you won't mind if we check your car.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.862
Like you said,
our job is to keep people safe.

28:58.447 --> 29:00.032
You're just going to scare the kids.

29:00.032 --> 29:02.993
Your boy should've thought of that before
he tried to steal government property,

29:02.993 --> 29:04.077
ma'am.

29:05.579 --> 29:06.914
- Hands up.
- What?

29:06.914 --> 29:09.666
I asked you to raise your hands
so I can check you for weapons.

29:09.666 --> 29:11.919
- I'm a mother.
- You'd be surprised what we've seen.

29:11.919 --> 29:15.380
- No, I wouldn't.
- Gun! Got a gun here.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.887
- Search their car.
- Yes, sir.

29:22.471 --> 29:25.015
That gun was for protection,
to defend my family.

29:25.015 --> 29:26.266
Please, just let us go.

29:26.266 --> 29:28.060
- Sam, say you're sorry.
- Sorry.

29:28.060 --> 29:29.811
- He said that already.
- Just--

29:31.021 --> 29:32.147
- Mommy!
- Hey!

29:32.147 --> 29:34.316
- Mommy!
- Don't touch her. Don't touch her!

29:34.316 --> 29:37.152
Listen, just take the gun. Keep it, okay?

29:37.152 --> 29:38.612
Just let us go, I beg you.

29:38.612 --> 29:40.697
We're just a family trying to survive!

29:41.198 --> 29:43.742
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Please, just-- I'm sorry.

29:43.742 --> 29:45.953
- Cap!
- Please, just don't hurt us.

29:45.953 --> 29:47.663
Let us go. Okay?

29:47.663 --> 29:48.789
Please, just stop.

29:49.456 --> 29:50.457
Please.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.339
- What is this?
- I don't know.

30:01.093 --> 30:02.261
What is your name?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.056
Ana Lewis.

30:09.101 --> 30:10.853
Get the electromagnetic field meter.

30:11.395 --> 30:12.396
Yes, sir.

30:14.439 --> 30:16.692
We're on the lookout
for a lot of things these days.

30:16.692 --> 30:19.945
But one of them is a family with something
the government thinks could be a weapon

30:19.945 --> 30:21.238
against the aliens.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.365
I don't know what you're talking about.

30:23.866 --> 30:25.492
This is just a piece of metal.

30:33.584 --> 30:34.793
Cap.

30:40.424 --> 30:41.633
Aneesha.

30:44.553 --> 30:45.554
Aneesha Malik.

30:50.601 --> 30:53.145
Load them and all their things
into the convoy.

30:54.396 --> 30:55.939
All right. Be gentle with her.

31:06.116 --> 31:07.326
Come here.

31:17.169 --> 31:18.462
Fall in!

31:18.462 --> 31:19.630
Hello.

31:19.630 --> 31:21.423
Let's move it!

31:21.423 --> 31:23.634
Let's go. Hurry up. Hurry up.

31:23.634 --> 31:25.302
You don't need to be afraid.

31:25.302 --> 31:27.054
Let's move. Let's go!

31:27.054 --> 31:28.430
At least not of me.

31:28.931 --> 31:30.140
Let's go!

31:35.437 --> 31:37.564
She failed the test.

31:37.564 --> 31:38.649
Badly.

31:39.441 --> 31:41.276
She's easily overstimulated,

31:41.276 --> 31:44.112
goes into fight-or-flight mode
in a matter of nanoseconds,

31:44.613 --> 31:47.032
and her response time
is the quickest I've seen.

31:47.032 --> 31:48.867
Also the most reckless.

31:48.867 --> 31:52.329
Well, I think we could use
a little recklessness at this point.

31:53.956 --> 31:56.583
Progress requires radical thinking.

31:57.918 --> 31:59.211
Be that as it may,

31:59.211 --> 32:02.673
you know what happened to the scientists
with stable baselines who went in there.

32:02.673 --> 32:04.383
Yeah, yeah, they gave us nothing.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.760
I'm talking about what happened to them.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.387
I know what you're talking about.

32:09.555 --> 32:12.516
But she might be my best chance
of saving the species.

32:13.350 --> 32:14.434
Your best chance?

32:15.227 --> 32:16.353
Good, good.

32:16.353 --> 32:19.356
I don't pay you to psychoanalyze me.

32:19.356 --> 32:20.732
So save it for the job.

32:22.067 --> 32:25.404
Look, she's the reason that thing's
sitting here in the Amazon

32:26.029 --> 32:27.322
instead of up in space.

32:27.322 --> 32:30.075
Which she doesn't see
as the same victory you do.

32:30.868 --> 32:34.413
Nikhil, this woman wasn't just
out in the field saving lives.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.541
She was out there to atone for taking one.

32:39.209 --> 32:42.171
She's operating
from a place of anger and guilt,

32:42.171 --> 32:44.548
which are two
of the most volatile motivators.

32:44.548 --> 32:48.302
You put her in that ship, and there's
no way to predict how she'll act or react.

32:49.720 --> 32:52.681
You don't care about her?
Think about the mission.

32:53.932 --> 32:55.058
Your mission.

32:57.311 --> 32:59.104
Okay, let's go tell her.

33:25.631 --> 33:29.426
So, Dr. Castillo says
you failed the tests.

33:29.426 --> 33:31.678
At least the ones you cared to complete.

33:31.678 --> 33:35.349
She says you're not psychologically stable
enough to go inside the ship,

33:35.349 --> 33:38.310
which is why Dr. Castillo
will be accompanying you into the ship.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.770
- What?
- No.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.606
Yeah. I know you two
got off to a rocky start.

33:42.606 --> 33:44.107
Had a bit of a ding-dong, didn't you?

33:44.107 --> 33:48.111
So you may not feel
all warm and fuzzy about this,

33:48.111 --> 33:51.198
but I'm a big believer
in not caring how people feel.

33:51.698 --> 33:53.534
Feelings get in the way.

33:54.159 --> 33:56.954
It's really one of the great failings
of our species,

33:57.454 --> 33:59.873
and may well be why we're losing this war.

33:59.873 --> 34:03.752
So, with that in mind, I'm ask--
Well, really, telling both of you

34:03.752 --> 34:07.798
to put whatever feelings you have aside.

34:08.422 --> 34:13.512
Go inside that ship
to see if you can make some magic again.

34:15.138 --> 34:17.056
You got into their hive mind once.

34:18.100 --> 34:19.851
I'm betting you can do it again.

34:19.851 --> 34:25.107
And to help cover that bet,
Maya will be there to monitor your mind.

34:25.607 --> 34:26.692
I don't need a monitor.

34:26.692 --> 34:27.775
Yes, you do.

34:28.485 --> 34:31.822
Maya's job is to map traces
of consciousness inside the ship.

34:31.822 --> 34:35.826
She can map your consciousness
and make sure you remain stable.

34:35.826 --> 34:37.536
Or as stable as your baseline,

34:37.536 --> 34:40.205
which, as we've established,
is not very stable.

34:40.205 --> 34:41.665
Great. That's settled then.

34:41.665 --> 34:44.668
So, should we stand here
while the world's burning?

34:45.168 --> 34:48.213
Or should we get you
suited and booted to help save it?

35:00.058 --> 35:01.435
Watch your step.

35:11.987 --> 35:13.906
The suit is coded to your biometrics.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.825
I'll be monitoring your vitals
at all times.

35:18.535 --> 35:21.455
If you detect any malfunction,
abort the mission.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.574
Word spreads fast.
They know you're going in.

36:00.494 --> 36:01.537
Maya.

36:02.329 --> 36:03.872
You good?

36:03.872 --> 36:05.666
We delivered the samples
to your lab, okay?

36:05.666 --> 36:06.750
Thank you.

36:06.750 --> 36:09.211
Mitsuki Yamato,
meet Tomas, our lead chemist

36:09.211 --> 36:11.046
and master sample collector.

36:11.046 --> 36:13.006
Welcome to the belly of the whale.

36:16.385 --> 36:18.762
The walls have
microscopic neural pathways.

36:19.263 --> 36:21.431
The ship is like an operational limb,

36:22.641 --> 36:24.726
which is why we can study
how it transmits data.

36:24.726 --> 36:26.353
She's going in?

36:26.353 --> 36:28.397
Nikhil approved it.

36:30.357 --> 36:33.694
It's his world,
and we're just living or dying in it.

36:34.444 --> 36:35.696
This way.

36:58.343 --> 36:59.511
What are these?

37:02.306 --> 37:03.557
Drop-ships.

37:04.183 --> 37:06.727
That's how the first wave of aliens
came to Earth.

37:07.811 --> 37:08.812
Cloaked.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.523
That's why we never saw them coming.

37:12.733 --> 37:14.484
We still don't see them coming.

37:17.863 --> 37:19.615
We're hoping you can help with that.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.634
My name is Clark, by the way.

37:43.889 --> 37:45.057
And you are?

37:45.557 --> 37:47.851
We don't talk to strangers.

37:48.435 --> 37:50.604
I'm not a stranger.
I just told you my name.

37:57.528 --> 37:58.862
Where are they taking us?

38:02.199 --> 38:04.117
Not far, I can tell you that.

38:07.663 --> 38:09.748
You're very calm for a man in handcuffs.

38:10.707 --> 38:13.085
Hardest prison to escape is your own mind.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.007
Sorry. I was

38:19.925 --> 38:21.844
a English teacher in the before times.

38:22.719 --> 38:23.720
Mom?

38:25.389 --> 38:26.682
What are you now?

38:26.682 --> 38:27.766
Same as you.

38:28.308 --> 38:29.351
A survivor.

38:30.519 --> 38:33.146
And if you wanna stay that way,
I suggest you trust me.

38:36.733 --> 38:37.860
Why?

38:37.860 --> 38:40.737
The definition of trust requires you
to relinquish that word.

38:42.906 --> 38:45.200
But I guess you could say the answer is...

38:47.369 --> 38:48.954
'cause I'm not really a prisoner here.

38:54.126 --> 38:55.836
Not everything is what it seems.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.774
Come on. She looks hurt.

39:17.774 --> 39:20.485
- Hey, kid, are you okay?
- What happened to you?

39:20.485 --> 39:22.237
You're gonna be all right.

39:24.281 --> 39:25.282
It's okay.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.913
- Hey. Hey, hey!
- All right. Okay.

39:30.913 --> 39:33.415
- You lie down. Get down!
- Hey!

39:34.917 --> 39:37.419
- Out of the truck!
- Get on the ground!

39:38.837 --> 39:40.005
What's going on?

39:40.005 --> 39:41.924
Stay calm and stay behind me.

39:45.844 --> 39:50.349
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit tight!
- On the ground, face down!

39:51.767 --> 39:53.894
Hey, give us the zip ties.

39:56.230 --> 39:58.357
Do it! Now!

40:01.235 --> 40:02.778
I got you. You're gonna be okay.

40:07.741 --> 40:09.201
Cover your ears.

40:15.207 --> 40:17.626
Watch yourselves! Fire in the hole!

40:25.551 --> 40:27.261
Come with us. Come on.

40:29.513 --> 40:30.597
Trust me.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.152
They called it in!

40:47.281 --> 40:48.574
We need to move out!

40:50.450 --> 40:51.451
Now or never.

40:52.578 --> 40:53.787
Mom.

40:56.164 --> 40:58.125
We need to get the things
they took from us.

40:58.125 --> 41:00.002
Get their things. Everything.

41:00.002 --> 41:01.420
Come on.

41:06.633 --> 41:09.928
On the hunt! On the hunt!
Get in the truck.

41:09.928 --> 41:11.805
- Get off.
- Hustle!

41:11.805 --> 41:14.266
Okay, let's go. Go, go, go!

41:21.481 --> 41:22.774
Fall in!

41:26.111 --> 41:28.030
We're fighting a war
against the same enemy.

41:28.697 --> 41:31.909
You guys start acting that way,
maybe it's a war that we can win.

41:32.701 --> 41:33.994
Take the bags!

41:33.994 --> 41:36.079
Leave their coats. Keep 'em warm.

41:39.333 --> 41:41.752
Let's go! Let's go!

41:41.752 --> 41:43.587
Yeah, that front one right there.

41:45.255 --> 41:46.632
Do final checks here.

41:48.634 --> 41:50.469
- All right, let's go!
- Come on!

41:54.348 --> 41:56.225
Good work. Let's go.

41:59.228 --> 42:00.229
Okay, let's go!

42:00.229 --> 42:01.688
- Ryder.
- Dad.

42:02.731 --> 42:03.732
Good work.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.026
Load it up, here.

42:06.902 --> 42:08.237
Pack it up.

42:08.237 --> 42:09.321
Are you okay?

42:09.321 --> 42:10.697
Pack up! Let's go!

42:10.697 --> 42:12.658
Good old-fashioned Heinz 57.

42:20.958 --> 42:21.959
Let's go!

42:22.918 --> 42:23.919
Like I said,

42:24.628 --> 42:26.171
not everything is what it seems.

42:50.946 --> 42:52.030
Here we are.

43:19.850 --> 43:22.519
Yeah. It's bigger than Canada in there.

43:31.945 --> 43:32.946
You saw it?

43:37.743 --> 43:38.994
You have live video?

43:39.786 --> 43:41.914
No, it distorts the feed.

43:48.378 --> 43:49.630
What's in there?

43:50.464 --> 43:52.299
An enormous power source.

43:53.300 --> 43:55.677
But we can't get past her
to find out what.

43:57.513 --> 43:58.805
Her?

44:02.351 --> 44:03.477
Follow me.

44:39.221 --> 44:42.307
You should know, everyone who's
entered this room suffered memory loss.

44:42.891 --> 44:46.395
And the last person to go in
suffered severe neurological damage.

44:48.230 --> 44:49.731
What sort of damage?

44:50.274 --> 44:51.400
I don't know yet.

44:52.109 --> 44:53.944
He hasn't regained consciousness.

45:00.075 --> 45:02.119
I wasn't trying to hurt you
with that test.

45:03.287 --> 45:04.788
I was trying to help you.

45:13.213 --> 45:14.756
Are you sure you want to do this?

45:16.800 --> 45:17.801
Yes.

45:19.845 --> 45:21.471
Protocol is 15 minutes and out.

45:21.471 --> 45:23.515
Higher functions check every two minutes.

45:24.850 --> 45:25.851
Got it.

45:26.435 --> 45:28.729
I can't guarantee
you won't forget your mother's face

45:28.729 --> 45:30.814
or the taste of your favorite food.

45:31.315 --> 45:32.441
I said I got it.

45:34.359 --> 45:35.652
Okay.

45:46.788 --> 45:47.873
Tether port.

45:48.874 --> 45:50.459
<i>Tether connected.</i>

45:50.459 --> 45:53.295
Press this
if you need emergency extraction.

45:53.295 --> 45:54.838
In case you can't speak.

45:57.382 --> 45:58.550
Helmet on.

46:19.363 --> 46:20.822
Showtime.

46:29.289 --> 46:31.291
Why don't you tell us where we're going?

46:31.291 --> 46:34.545
Told you already. Somewhere safe, warm.

46:35.337 --> 46:36.588
Get some food and sleep.

46:37.881 --> 46:38.882
Then we keep moving.

46:38.882 --> 46:41.260
Thank you,
but we will just get our things and go.

46:42.052 --> 46:43.512
That wouldn't be wise.

46:44.304 --> 46:46.640
Then again, you were in the back
of that military van.

46:47.140 --> 46:48.517
I know who you people are.

46:50.602 --> 46:52.145
The orange colors.

46:53.564 --> 46:55.607
You call yourself "the Movement."

46:57.067 --> 46:58.610
- Anarchists.
- Activists.

46:58.610 --> 47:01.530
We don't want any trouble.
We just want our things.

47:04.449 --> 47:06.910
- I mean, it's cold out there, Mom.
- Doesn't matter.

47:08.412 --> 47:09.872
Mom, I'm hungry.

47:10.747 --> 47:12.165
Comin' up.

47:21.383 --> 47:22.801
The gate!

47:27.681 --> 47:28.891
Let's go!

47:43.322 --> 47:44.531
Hold!

48:02.216 --> 48:03.884
We're the only warm place for miles.

48:04.885 --> 48:07.304
I know because we scouted
the next 50 miles.

48:07.304 --> 48:08.847
It's what we do.

48:09.348 --> 48:12.100
Help people. Keep them safe.

48:13.769 --> 48:15.145
People like you.

48:16.063 --> 48:18.482
Here you go. All your stuff.

48:21.527 --> 48:23.946
- Thank you.
- You can get a good night's sleep,

48:23.946 --> 48:27.282
and we'll take you to the closest refugee
camp in the morning. How's that sound?

48:27.282 --> 48:29.117
Is that hot chocolate?

48:29.618 --> 48:31.787
Yes, it is hot chocolate. You want some?

48:38.585 --> 48:42.047
You're one of those who thinks it's safer
not to make any connections.

48:42.047 --> 48:43.507
The truth is the opposite.

48:45.384 --> 48:47.594
Connections are the only thing
keeping us alive.

48:57.312 --> 48:59.523
Go get some hot chocolate. Go.

49:40.314 --> 49:41.523
Here we go.

50:03.545 --> 50:05.297
<i>Yamato, check-in.</i>

50:05.297 --> 50:09.343
<i>First phone number. College roommate.
What color are my eyes?</i>

50:10.427 --> 50:15.015
02-555-0876.

50:15.015 --> 50:16.350
Ichiko. Green.

50:16.350 --> 50:19.061
<i>Good, good. You're doing great.</i>

50:20.646 --> 50:23.065
<i>Tracking neurological activity
throughout the ship.</i>

50:23.774 --> 50:27.402
<i>All the frequencies you requested
are loaded onto your wrist interface.</i>

50:46.755 --> 50:48.173
It's responding to her.

50:51.134 --> 50:52.135
This is crazy.

50:54.096 --> 50:56.431
What the hell...?

51:43.187 --> 51:44.271
<i>What the hell's happening?</i>

51:46.398 --> 51:48.525
- It's almost time to pull her out.
- No.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.402
Fifteen minutes and out. It's protocol.

51:50.903 --> 51:52.362
To hell with protocol.

51:52.905 --> 51:56.033
If we sever this connection now,
we may never get it back.

51:56.033 --> 51:57.242
You don't know that.

51:57.242 --> 51:59.411
If we leave her in there,
we might not get her back.

51:59.411 --> 52:01.038
Yeah, that's an acceptable risk.

52:01.747 --> 52:05.042
- It's not your risk.
- She stays in until this connection breaks

52:05.542 --> 52:06.710
or she does.

52:21.308 --> 52:23.685
Let's try this.

53:15.153 --> 53:16.280
Is that--

54:38.195 --> 54:39.321
Luke.

54:40.656 --> 54:41.657
Luke.

54:45.744 --> 54:46.954
Luke, what is it?

54:47.621 --> 54:48.956
Can you hear that?

54:54.837 --> 54:56.338
Hear what?

54:57.965 --> 54:58.966
That...

55:01.635 --> 55:02.761
humming.

55:32.875 --> 55:34.459
What's going on?

55:34.459 --> 55:36.170
It started a few moments ago.

55:36.170 --> 55:40.048
I thought it was just another tremor, like
the others. But the others were random.

55:55.439 --> 55:58.233
This tremor is rhythmic. It has a pattern.

56:00.944 --> 56:03.280
It's different this time.

56:03.989 --> 56:06.325
Something's changed.
