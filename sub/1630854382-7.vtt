00:02.567 --> 00:04.787
<i>Back in the '80s,
Country-Western music
swept the nation,</i>

00:04.961 --> 00:06.049
<i>from Dolly Parton
to Reba McEntire.</i>

00:07.833 --> 00:09.096
<i>The cowboy hats
and line dancing</i>

00:09.270 --> 00:10.662
<i>even found their way
to suburban Philly.</i>

00:13.056 --> 00:15.885
JTP? What are you doing here?

00:16.059 --> 00:17.321
We came to see if Barry wanted
to go to the campus pool

00:17.495 --> 00:19.106
and watch the ladies
diving team.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.325
We're extremely lonely,
and it's currently not illegal.

00:21.499 --> 00:22.892
Tell me if this
is a good pick-up line--

00:23.066 --> 00:24.763
-"Nice splash, toots."
- It's not.

00:24.937 --> 00:27.549
I hear the JTP!
I'm not coming down!

00:27.723 --> 00:30.943
You have to, honey! We kiss,
so you do the things I want.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.858
Fine!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.295
But I don't want to hear
so much as a peep from anyone!

00:37.037 --> 00:39.517
- Tarnation!
- Holy cowboy.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.216
- Very pale rider.
- Have at it!

00:42.390 --> 00:45.001
For your information,
Joanne has been
taking me line dancing,

00:45.175 --> 00:47.743
and since I'm loving
and supportive,
I have embraced it.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.353
- Mm!
- Not as much as those jeans

00:49.527 --> 00:51.616
have embraced
your buttocks and thighs.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.618
Yes, I do traditionally enjoy
a loose trouser

00:53.792 --> 00:56.230
that accommodates
my thunderous lower half,

00:56.404 --> 00:57.840
but these Lee jeans
are surprisingly comfy.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.625
They hug nice.
Jo Jo like.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.018
Is that a pearl-snap
cowboy shirt?

01:02.192 --> 01:03.846
Good eye, Naked Rob.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.804
You can yank it right off
like a Sixers warm-up jersey.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.242
I've done it.
It starts the mood.

01:08.416 --> 01:11.027
And I see you've
chosen a black hat?
Does that make you the villain?

01:11.201 --> 01:12.985
Don't be absurd,
Matt Bradley.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.424
Does your tie-dye shirt
make you the chill,
mellow, nice guy?

01:16.598 --> 01:18.861
- It kinda does, yeah.
- Well, I just have
one more question--

01:19.035 --> 01:20.167
Are there single women
at this place?

01:20.341 --> 01:23.387
A ton, and they all dress
in Daisy Dukes,

01:23.561 --> 01:25.563
crop tops,
and pigtail braids.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.130
- I wanna be a good ol' boy!
- Me, too!

01:27.304 --> 01:29.393
- Yee-haw I think!
- Oh, wait!

01:29.567 --> 01:31.656
If you wanna join us,
we have to teach you to dance.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.530
Toes on the line
and follow my lead!

01:38.924 --> 01:41.188
Channel the pain
of a hardscrabble
prairie life--

01:41.362 --> 01:43.451
Coaster Step
into a Lasso Spin!

01:44.887 --> 01:47.107
Oh, y'all are naturals!

01:47.281 --> 01:48.804
Doing things in a line is fun!

01:48.978 --> 01:50.936
Big finish!

01:51.111 --> 01:52.677
Rocking Chair
into a Rattlesnake Shimmy!

01:54.592 --> 01:56.116
And Heel, Shuffle, Pose!

01:56.290 --> 01:57.813
Yee-haw!

02:22.446 --> 02:23.360
Oh, no.
That goes over here.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.712
Oh, that goes, uh,
over here.

02:29.323 --> 02:30.976
Oh, my God.
These go here.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.938
Oh, no. Honey.
Oh, Jeebus.

02:38.984 --> 02:42.118
Yeah, Schmoo, Schmoo?
Why don't you go play
with your Nintendos?

02:42.292 --> 02:43.206
Blegh. I've beaten every game.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.818
What's going on in your world,
my grumpy gramps?

02:46.992 --> 02:47.993
Sorting buttons.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.344
Why?

02:50.518 --> 02:52.302
So they're in groups.
Enough with the questions,
Joe Friday.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.438
- Ooh, a swirly one.
- Beginner's luck.

02:57.612 --> 02:59.527
Less talkin', more sortin'.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.659
<i>So I started
spending more time
with the only person</i>

03:01.833 --> 03:03.922
<i>who had nowhere else to go.</i>

03:04.096 --> 03:05.402
Just one time
I'd like to see

03:05.576 --> 03:07.230
Judge Wapner sentence
someone to death.

03:09.058 --> 03:10.494
Oh, this is much too...

03:10.668 --> 03:12.017
- Creamy.
- ...creamy, yeah.

03:14.106 --> 03:17.284
Uh, another squirrel
made it across.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.763
<i>Yep,
hanging with Pop-Pop
wasn't super exciting,</i>

03:18.937 --> 03:21.288
<i>but it filled the days.</i>

03:21.462 --> 03:22.767
Need help
buckling her in?

03:22.941 --> 03:24.378
No, we're okay,
but are you?

03:24.856 --> 03:26.510
Oh, yeah.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.773
After my nap, I'm gonna split
a pear with Pop-Pop.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.298
Wow. Sounds pretty jam-packed.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.822
Tuesdays, am I right?

03:33.996 --> 03:35.476
- It's Friday.
- Good talk.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.826
Uh, uh... see you around
the mulberry tree.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.484
Oh, man, Adam's spending way
too much time with Pop-Pop.

03:43.658 --> 03:44.659
Eh, we got our own kid
to worry about.

03:44.833 --> 03:46.530
He's probably fine.

03:46.704 --> 03:48.271
<i>But I wasn't.
I really wasn't.</i>

03:50.273 --> 03:53.145
Need help with Muriel?
Nope? Cool.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.365
Dude, I wouldn't let you
near our child right now.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.106
She poops herself
and she's cleaner than you.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.064
Roger that.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.023
Uh, Erica, what is going on
with him?

04:01.197 --> 04:02.372
Remember when I dropped
out of college

04:02.546 --> 04:05.027
and I sank into a slovenly
self-hating abyss?

04:05.201 --> 04:06.289
Oh, no. That was such
an unappealing time for you.

04:06.463 --> 04:08.248
Not my point.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.553
- But, yes,
we have to help him.
- Yeah.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.599
Hey, Adam,
I say this with love--

04:11.773 --> 04:13.383
You're pathetic
and hard to look at.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.732
Smelling you
is also no picnic.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.473
That's you?

04:16.647 --> 04:18.780
I thought your
mom's been making
hard-boiled eggs all week.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.348
I get it,
I'm in a bit of a rut.
But it'll pass.

04:21.522 --> 04:23.393
Adam, I've been
where you are.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.917
- When I stopped going
to school, things got dark.
- Real dark.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.484
Like, "What am I doing
with this person?" dark.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.007
Easy, now.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.140
But now she follows basic
hygiene like the rest of us.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.708
- You're doing it, baby!
- Guys, it's all good.

04:33.882 --> 04:37.668
I'm just gonna chill on
the couch and watch <i>Gunsmoke</i>
until I can finally go to NYU.

04:37.842 --> 04:39.975
It's not all good.
You look and smell
like hot ass.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.629
Find a new job.

04:41.803 --> 04:44.066
Hey! Lay off the kid.
He's got Lyme disease.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.633
Adam doesn't have
Lyme disease.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.287
I thought that's why
he's being such a lazy slug.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.898
Some tick stole
his life force, no?

04:50.072 --> 04:52.640
- Fine, I'll look for a job.
- Yeah, I'll even help.

04:52.814 --> 04:53.902
Everywhere I turn,
he's there.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.600
And his button sorting is

04:56.774 --> 04:58.733
<i>My life didn't give me
much to brag about.</i>

04:58.907 --> 05:03.303
<i>But as a new grandmother,
my mom was as boastful as ever.</i>

05:03.477 --> 05:07.394
Oh, my signature client.
What are we doing today?

05:07.568 --> 05:09.613
How about nothing
because you're perfect?

05:09.787 --> 05:12.355
Oh, Frank, stop.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.401
Why hasn't some gal
scooped you up yet?

05:14.575 --> 05:16.272
That's a mystery
to my mother, too.

05:16.446 --> 05:19.928
Have I shown you
the most recent 200
photos of my granddaughter?

05:20.102 --> 05:23.235
- Ginzy, can you
pick up the end?
- Yeah! Always happy to help.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.108
- Maybe, um,
go down a little bit.
- Okay.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.153
Really stretch it taut
so he can get
a bird's-eye view.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.808
Frank, I, too,
am Muriel's grandmother.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.636
Linda, please,
this is my time.

05:32.810 --> 05:35.160
Prepare yourself, Frank.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.076
You're gonna love these more
than that Elton John concert
you wouldn't shut up about.

05:38.250 --> 05:41.079
Beverly Goldberg.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.692
But who's guarding the bridge
if the troll is here?

05:44.866 --> 05:47.869
Jane Bales.
That's quite an outfit.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.871
Is your horse
hitched outside?

05:50.045 --> 05:53.222
Or are you the horse
and Jane is hitched outside?

05:53.396 --> 05:55.529
It's all so confusing
because you both have,
wait for it...

05:57.357 --> 06:00.229
Horse faces.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.449
Tedious and clumsy,
just like you.

06:02.623 --> 06:04.364
We're going line dancing.

06:04.538 --> 06:07.279
Not something you'd be
familiar with, Grandma.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.456
Oh, so you heard
the incredible news

06:09.630 --> 06:12.894
that I created someone
who created someone?

06:13.068 --> 06:15.940
I was referring to your gray,
desiccated, listless hair.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.768
I can't see any gray.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.380
It's blurry.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.207
You really should
pick up those bifocals

06:22.382 --> 06:24.471
that Lou ordered--

06:24.645 --> 06:26.473
Is something that
I should've said privately.

06:26.647 --> 06:30.868
Don't worry.
This old crone can't
hear you unless you shout.

06:31.042 --> 06:32.174
So, will I see you all tonight
at Rhinestones and Roses?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.872
Hold up!

06:35.046 --> 06:36.396
You guys go
line dancing together?

06:36.570 --> 06:38.659
Well, we invited you.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.575
But you said you were,
you know, too tired
from being a grandma.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.664
I said that?

06:43.838 --> 06:46.231
Your exact words were,
"I'm tired.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.799
Being a grandma makes me tired.
I'm a tired grandma."

06:48.973 --> 06:51.715
Well, when you put as much
effort into it as I do,

06:51.889 --> 06:54.936
it can be tiring because
I am not just a good grandma--

06:55.110 --> 06:56.154
Oh, God, please say it.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.982
I am a great grandma.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.724
There it is.

07:00.898 --> 07:05.468
Yes, you are a great,
great grandma.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.731
Damn it!
So much unfortunate word play.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.951
This has honestly been
too perfect.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.692
So, good luck
with your grays, Granny.

07:11.866 --> 07:13.258
I'm gonna get out
of Frank's way

07:13.433 --> 07:16.131
because God knows he's got
his work cut out for him.

07:16.305 --> 07:18.438
Bye!

07:18.612 --> 07:20.831
Well, thanks for getting
my back, Essie!

07:21.005 --> 07:22.659
I don't know.
I thought it went fine.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.487
Oh, really?
Is this fine?

07:24.661 --> 07:26.271
Why?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.752
Linda was closer!

07:28.926 --> 07:30.667
Frank will fix it
when he's done with me.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.800
Get those fingers
flying, Frank.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.367
<i>Jane Bales had rattled
my mom.</i>

07:35.542 --> 07:38.414
<i>Meanwhile, I was reeling from
the lack of job opportunities.</i>

07:38.588 --> 07:40.372
Okay, I found the perfect
job for you--

07:40.547 --> 07:43.332
- Mortician's assistant.
- Magician's assistant?

07:43.506 --> 07:45.552
Saw me in half
and pull a rabbit
outta my butt, I'm in!

07:45.726 --> 07:47.554
Mortician. Their only trick

07:47.728 --> 07:50.382
is to pickle dead people
so they don't rot too fast.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.080
Considering I threw up
when I saw

07:52.254 --> 07:54.125
whatever's going on
with your heel,
I'm gonna pass.

07:54.299 --> 07:56.650
Oh, my. Didn't realize
I was splitting an egg cream
with the Prince of Persia.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.131
Happy birthday,
Mr. Presidents.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.046
I'm sex symbol Marilyn someone.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.353
Uh, what'll it be?

08:04.527 --> 08:05.789
What the hell
is this place?

08:05.963 --> 08:07.356
It's a '50s diner, gramps.

08:07.530 --> 08:09.314
People are suckers
for nostalgia.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.447
'50s, feh.
Why did TV need color?

08:11.621 --> 08:13.057
Carla, I'll handle this table.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.800
Blue suede shoes.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.236
Can I take your order?

08:18.410 --> 08:20.151
Johnny, it's Adam.
You know me.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.023
Oh, hey, Goldnerd.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.590
Welcome to the old times.
What can I get you?

08:23.764 --> 08:24.547
How about another waiter?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.331
Yeah, I get that a lot.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.332
Normally,
I just manage the place,

08:27.507 --> 08:28.899
but we're short-staffed.

08:29.073 --> 08:32.076
Ha! Short-staffed.
I'm in a position
of authority.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.905
Oh, man, this is
actually perfect.
I'm looking for a job.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.254
You got any experience
waiting tables?

08:36.428 --> 08:39.431
No, but I have tons
of experience
eating at tables.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.824
That's not nothin'.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.652
Follow-up question--
Are you now,

08:42.826 --> 08:44.567
or have you ever been, a member
of the Communist Party?

08:44.741 --> 08:46.047
I don't think so.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.484
- You're hired.
- That's it?

08:48.658 --> 08:49.833
The kid's spilled
three times,

08:50.007 --> 08:50.834
and we haven't
ordered a thing yet.

08:51.008 --> 08:52.749
The bar is real low here.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.838
Nice. I did it.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.927
<i>So I was gonna be a waiter.</i>

08:57.101 --> 08:58.842
<i>Meanwhile, my mom wasn't gonna
have to wait much longer</i>

08:59.016 --> 09:02.106
<i>to prove to Jane Bales
that she was still young.</i>

09:02.280 --> 09:04.935
Wait, don't tell me you boys
are into line dancing, too.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.503
It's awesome
and sweaty and fun!

09:07.677 --> 09:08.809
It's like sports,
but there's girls.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.071
Girls play sports.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.638
You've oversimplified
my new passion.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.944
I'm partial to jazz and tap,
but it fills a void.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.903
Wait, am I the only person
in Jenkintown

09:16.077 --> 09:18.340
who hasn't tried this?-Yes, ma'am.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.864
In fact, I was thinking,
we should all have
cowboy names.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.387
And then
at the honky-tonk,

09:22.562 --> 09:23.650
that's what we use
to talk to each other.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.173
That's perfect.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.828
Great! Okay. 'Cause I already
got my name-- Bronco.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.699
- I'll be Bronco.
- Wait, what?

09:29.873 --> 09:31.788
I'm feeling like a Tex.
It's my very first thought,

09:31.962 --> 09:33.355
but I also don't care,
'cause I freakin' love it.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.444
- You got it, Tex.
- Thank you kindly, Bronco.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.707
- Wait, that's my name.
- What about Colt for me?

09:37.881 --> 09:38.621
It's settled.
You're Colt,

09:38.795 --> 09:41.102
Naked Rob is Tex,
Barry is Bronco,

09:41.276 --> 09:42.756
- and Andy is Half-Pint.
- Half-Pint?

09:42.930 --> 09:44.453
What does that have to do
with anything country?

09:44.627 --> 09:48.370
Oh, and I'll be Miss Lula Blaze
from Tombstone Gulch.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.328
You're joining us for
some boot-scootin', Mrs. G?

09:50.502 --> 09:52.330
If it's what the young
people are doing,
it's what I'm doing, too.

09:52.504 --> 09:54.158
- Let's rock!
- Okay.

09:54.332 --> 09:57.074
<i>♪ Hey, ho, here we go
Let's ride... ♪</i>

09:57.248 --> 09:59.555
Beverly, so great
to see you here!

09:59.729 --> 10:01.862
And that "Cowgirl" sweater
is adorable.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.691
And accurate,
because "girl" is what I am.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.431
Other words
that might go here are

10:06.606 --> 10:09.086
"agile," "energetic,"
"robust,"

10:09.260 --> 10:11.480
and, of course,
"proud American."

10:11.654 --> 10:15.266
Oh, that seems like
that would require
a lot of rhinestones.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.660
- Hi, Barry.
- I'm not Barry, I'm Bronco.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.401
- Colt.
- Tex.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.533
Andy's fine.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.667
Okay, cowboys and cowgirls,
time to hit the dance floor!

10:28.584 --> 10:31.195
Mom, you sure
you wanna do this?
It's harder than it looks.

10:31.369 --> 10:34.198
Please, Barry.
Disco, salsa, break, belly--

10:34.372 --> 10:35.852
There isn't a dance
I haven't mastered.

10:36.026 --> 10:36.810
Let's go.

10:37.854 --> 10:40.683
Beverly, you're here.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.120
Did one of these fine men
throw a rope around you

10:43.294 --> 10:44.948
and try to take you
to auction?

10:45.122 --> 10:47.168
- If that's not clear,
I'm suggesting--
- It's clear.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.997
I love your 10-gallon hat
and your 20-gallon skirt.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.738
- If that wasn't clear--
- It's clear!

10:52.869 --> 10:55.176
Now let's get to steppin'!

10:55.350 --> 10:56.960
Yee-haw!

10:57.134 --> 10:59.049
Two, three, four!

10:59.223 --> 11:01.269
- <i>
And step my mom did.</i>
- Oh.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.749
<i>- She stepped on Essie.</i>
- Ow! Ow!

11:02.923 --> 11:04.968
Essie!
Watch your big feet.

11:05.142 --> 11:07.014
Sorry!
They're just a little big.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.624
<i>- She stepped on Linda.</i>
- Oh!

11:08.798 --> 11:09.886
It's okay,
it happens all the time.

11:10.060 --> 11:12.019
Stay in your space.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.455
<i>And finally,
she stepped on herself.</i>

11:13.629 --> 11:16.066
Whoa! Oh! Ow! Ow!

11:16.240 --> 11:17.720
Ooh, we have a nag down
in the barn.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.810
- Mom!
- A nag is down in the barn.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.465
I'm being folksy, but I think
that woman is really hurt.

11:23.639 --> 11:25.902
Ooh, my gorgeous ankle!

11:28.426 --> 11:31.734
<i>And just like that,
my mom's attempt to rise above</i>

11:31.908 --> 11:34.781
<i>Jane Bale's insults led to her
falling on the dance floor</i>

11:34.955 --> 11:35.912
<i>and feeling lower than ever.</i>

11:39.786 --> 11:41.875
<i>After my mom's spill
on the dance floor,</i>

11:42.049 --> 11:43.964
<i>she was determined
to get herself back on track.</i>

11:44.138 --> 11:46.053
<i>But there were some obstacles.</i>

11:46.227 --> 11:48.620
Good news,
it's just a sprain.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.839
But you will need
some help walking.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.714
<i>And her new
bifocals were just so-so.</i>

11:54.888 --> 11:56.237
Are you sure these make me
seem younger?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.021
Absolutely.

11:58.195 --> 11:59.980
You look like all my aunts
I had crushes on.

12:00.154 --> 12:01.503
But they're stylish, right?

12:01.677 --> 12:03.592
Beverly, when it comes
to eyewear,

12:03.766 --> 12:05.115
no one knows hip
like King Louie.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.161
King Louie?

12:07.335 --> 12:09.946
Would I refer to myself
in such regal terms

12:10.120 --> 12:13.776
if I wasn't
completely confident?

12:13.950 --> 12:16.257
<i>And, unfortunately, there was
a hiccup at the hair salon.</i>

12:16.431 --> 12:18.172
Goodbye, gray.
Hello, platinum blonde!

12:18.738 --> 12:19.390
Uh-oh.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.482
What the [bleep] Frank?

12:24.656 --> 12:26.833
<i>Things couldn't
get any worse for my mom...</i>

12:27.007 --> 12:28.182
<i>until the absolute worst
walked in.</i>

12:28.356 --> 12:29.531
Perfect.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.838
Beverly, nice to see you.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.144
Why aren't you
hurling insults at me?

12:34.318 --> 12:36.494
I look like the
"Where's the beef?" lady
from the Wendy's commercial.

12:36.668 --> 12:37.321
Don't be silly.

12:39.236 --> 12:40.803
Are you pitying me?

12:40.977 --> 12:43.240
Nonsense.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.330
Just, um,
taking a little break
from our usual sparring.

12:46.504 --> 12:48.550
- Look me in the eye, Jane.
- I'd rather not.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.726
Jane, look me in the eye
and insult me!

12:50.900 --> 12:52.380
Beverly, don't make me.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.990
-"Where's the beef?"
- Please don't say that.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.775
-"Where's the beef?"
- Beverly, stop it!

12:55.949 --> 12:57.994
-"Where's the beef?"
- That's enough! Okay?

12:58.168 --> 13:00.562
You just--
God, you look so old.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.651
And it is so sad.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.000
And I just feel awful
for everything I've
ever said to you.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.265
<i>As my mom was hitting
a new low...</i>

13:08.439 --> 13:10.659
How far have I fallen?

13:10.833 --> 13:13.880
<i>I was hitting the bongos
in my new role as a beatnik.</i>

13:14.054 --> 13:14.881
Specials.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.362
Carrot soup... tuna...

13:19.450 --> 13:21.365
and truth.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.541
Here's some truth--
The tuna was also
yesterday's special.

13:23.715 --> 13:24.368
Read into that
what you will.

13:29.547 --> 13:32.159
- Hey, there he is.
- Yo, daddy-o, how's it cookin'?

13:32.333 --> 13:33.943
You're not at work.
Don't talk like that.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.685
- Dig it.
- Where you going? <i>
Wheel</i> is on.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.688
Can't. I gotta bone up
on my diner lingo.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.343
Did you know "Adam and Eve
on a raft" is toast and eggs?

13:42.517 --> 13:43.474
So folksy and unnecessary.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.348
Eh, not sure
about this job.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.567
What are you talking about?
This is great for him.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.395
Yeah, he pulled himself
out of his rut so fast.

13:51.569 --> 13:53.093
Erica went ungroomed
for months.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.182
We covered that part
of my past, Geoff.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.401
I had to buy a horse-mane brush
from the feed shop.

13:57.575 --> 13:59.882
Yep, peaks and valleys.
We all got 'em.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.928
Once, I saw her make
a Cheetos sandwich.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.320
Before she took a bite
she told it,
it was her best friend.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.192
That cheesy,
crunchy sandwich

14:05.366 --> 14:06.758
is definitely
topping you right now.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.413
First Adam's a beatnik,
next thing you know,

14:09.587 --> 14:11.111
he's shooting dice with Lenny
Bruce and the Black Panthers.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.591
That seems like a logical
next step after a diner job,

14:13.765 --> 14:15.463
but the kid
has a purpose again.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.378
If you're worried about him,
just go down to the diner.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.597
You'll feel better
seeing Adam working hard.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.862
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Also, all this sad sandwich
and horse-brush talk

14:23.036 --> 14:24.994
makes me want to take a break
from you two for a while.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.866
<i>While Pop-Pop
was missing me at home,</i>

14:27.040 --> 14:29.259
<i>my mom was missing her youth.</i>

14:29.433 --> 14:32.132
"There was an old woman
who lived in a shoe."

14:32.306 --> 14:33.873
And she was probably
younger than me.

14:35.396 --> 14:36.876
I mean, look at her,
so vibrant,

14:37.050 --> 14:38.747
living the dream
in her downtown shoe.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.705
That's not how that goes.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.447
How it goes
is downhill from here.

14:43.621 --> 14:45.972
Watch Muriel for a sec.
I gotta get her pacifier.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.147
Why are you
carrying your purse?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.540
Because that's
what old ladies do.

14:49.714 --> 14:53.196
We clutch our purses filled
with Geritol tablets,

14:53.370 --> 14:55.938
frayed bingo cards,
and memories of what was.

14:56.112 --> 14:57.635
All right, Mom,
this is ridiculous.

14:57.809 --> 14:59.246
- Just put this down.
- Get off me,
you whippersnapper.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.377
Whippersnapper?

15:00.551 --> 15:02.989
That's right.
That's a word I use now.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.512
That's enough!

15:04.686 --> 15:07.210
You are not that old,
and you know it.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.647
And the doctor said
your ankle's back to normal,

15:09.821 --> 15:11.127
so you can stop
with the cane.

15:11.301 --> 15:12.520
Okay, well,
it doesn't matter.
I feel old.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.219
I'm a grandma,
a widow.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.395
It's obvious my best days
are behind me.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.006
Oh, stop it.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.138
You're the most energetic, relentless,

15:22.312 --> 15:23.357
and intrusive person
I've ever known.

15:24.010 --> 15:26.273
Oh, Barry.

15:26.447 --> 15:29.667
How is it you always know
the exact right thing to say?

15:29.841 --> 15:32.148
What do you say?
We practice a little more

15:32.322 --> 15:33.758
and hit Rhinestones and Roses
tonight?

15:33.933 --> 15:36.805
I say yee-haw!

15:36.979 --> 15:39.286
<i>Thanks to Barry,
my mom was on a roll,</i>

15:39.460 --> 15:41.679
<i>and I was serving one
to an unexpected customer.</i>

15:41.853 --> 15:42.376
Hey, Pop-Pop!

15:43.507 --> 15:45.466
This roll is stale.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.077
<i>An unexpected
and difficult customer.</i>

15:48.251 --> 15:50.036
New one coming up.
Good to see you.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.864
- And coffee.
- You got it.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.518
I don't want what's been
sitting around.
Fresh pot.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.869
Snap, snap, snap.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.829
<i>An unexpected, difficult,
and rude customer.</i>

16:01.003 --> 16:02.700
<i>And things got worse
from there.</i>

16:02.874 --> 16:04.354
That was too close
to Marlon Brando.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.181
<i>He changed tables.</i>

16:06.661 --> 16:07.488
Tomatoes
are too wet.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.577
<i>He sent back food.</i>

16:09.751 --> 16:12.232
And, Marilyn, you were never
good enough for DiMaggio.
Not even close!

16:12.406 --> 16:14.321
I don't know or care
who that is.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.236
<i>And, of course, the service
was not to his liking.</i>

16:16.410 --> 16:18.064
Oh, thanks
for remembering me.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.066
I had to yell at that guy
who was dressed
like Frank Sinatra.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.632
That's just a guy
with blue eyes.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.373
And why are you
riding me like this?

16:23.547 --> 16:24.461
What, because
I'm your grandfather,

16:24.635 --> 16:25.985
I should let you slack off?
Huh?

16:26.159 --> 16:27.769
With that attitude,
you get no tip.

16:27.943 --> 16:31.251
Fine. I'll give you
a tip instead.
You're bad news, daddy-o.

16:31.425 --> 16:34.297
That's it. Where's Elvis?
I demand to see Elvis!

16:34.471 --> 16:36.082
Love me tender.
How can I help you?

16:36.256 --> 16:37.909
This beatnik
has no respect.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.302
To think people like me
fought in a war

16:39.476 --> 16:40.782
so that he could smoke
clove cigarettes

16:40.956 --> 16:42.262
and write poems
that don't rhyme.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.959
You didn't fight
in the war.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.656
I said people like me!

16:45.830 --> 16:47.658
Why are you being
such a turd right now?

16:47.832 --> 16:50.052
Whoa, Goldnerd,
much as I respect you

16:50.226 --> 16:51.401
for treating customers
like this,

16:51.575 --> 16:53.012
you can't treat customers
like this.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.491
- You're fired.
- What?

16:54.665 --> 16:55.927
No, I... I didn't mean--

16:56.102 --> 16:58.974
Save it! All you wanted
was for me to get a job

16:59.148 --> 17:01.107
and learn how to work hard,
then you come here and ruin it?

17:01.281 --> 17:02.151
Thanks a lot,
Pop-Pop.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.812
<i>With Barry's help,
my mom was ready</i>

17:10.986 --> 17:13.119
<i>to honky-tonk the night away
and reclaim her youth.</i>

17:13.293 --> 17:17.036
<i>- But she forgot one thing...</i>
- Okay, we're off.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.864
Muriel just woke up, and, uh,
she's in a mood. Enjoy.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.257
Wait, you guys
are going out?

17:21.431 --> 17:23.564
Remember? You're babysitting?

17:23.738 --> 17:25.914
We have Lou's dumb
eye man award ceremony.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.437
He's being honored

17:27.611 --> 17:29.396
by the Professional Ophthalmologists
of Philadelphia.

17:29.570 --> 17:31.833
Yes, the acronym is POOP,
and, no, I don't know why
they don't change it.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.574
So Lou's winning a...

17:33.748 --> 17:35.097
You know
it's a Poopie.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.143
And how would you phrase it
if he won?

17:37.317 --> 17:38.927
My dad
brought home the Poopie.

17:39.101 --> 17:39.884
Yeah, worth it.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.411
Well, I guess
it's for the best.

17:44.585 --> 17:47.936
I would've just embarrassed
myself again anyway.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.111
Back to being
just a grandma.

17:50.765 --> 17:51.374
Maybe there's
another option.

17:55.726 --> 17:58.207
<i>So they did what any fun,
youthful grandma would do--</i>

17:58.381 --> 18:00.949
<i>Bring a baby
to a Country-Western bar.</i>

18:01.123 --> 18:02.516
I need to borrow the mic
for a second.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.387
- That's not something
we really--
- Yes. Yeah.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.347
Attention, honky-tonkers.
- Whoo!

18:07.521 --> 18:10.045
The other night,
I made a bit
of a fool of myself

18:10.219 --> 18:13.135
here on the dance floor,
and I have to admit,
I was feelin' kind of low.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.574
But then someone reminded me

18:17.748 --> 18:20.621
that just because
you get a little older,

18:20.795 --> 18:22.101
it doesn't mean
you're not still
young at heart.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.714
I'd like to dedicate
this first dance to him.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.978
- We don't do dedications.
- To my son,
Bronco Goldberg.

18:31.806 --> 18:32.502
You may begin the hoedown!

18:32.676 --> 18:33.677
Whoo!

18:33.851 --> 18:35.114
- Yee-haw!
- Whoo-hoo!

18:35.288 --> 18:36.463
This is a terrible idea, Beverly.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.160
You are gonna fall
on that baby.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.684
The only thing
I'm gonna destroy
is the dance floor.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.686
What?

18:42.860 --> 18:46.603
No. No. I said "fall."
Did you not hear me?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.910
I'm even more
concerned now.

18:49.084 --> 18:51.782
<i>And with that,
my mom was back
in the saddle...</i>

18:51.956 --> 18:54.002
I'm the first woman
to have it all!

18:55.960 --> 18:57.440
<i>...while I was still saddled
with disappointment.</i>

18:59.050 --> 19:00.226
You got a second?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.357
Whatever.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.315
I got your job back.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.186
Thanks.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.710
But I still
don't understand

19:06.884 --> 19:08.886
why you came in
and acted that way.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.453
It was like you were
mad at me or something.

19:10.627 --> 19:11.889
I don't know.

19:12.063 --> 19:15.110
Sort of got used
to having you around.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.721
And I thought maybe
it didn't mean as much
to you as it did to me.

19:19.810 --> 19:23.292
So... you missed me.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.989
Hey, don't put words
in my mouth.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.861
But, yeah,
I guess I did.

19:27.035 --> 19:29.559
You could have
just said something.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.127
I'm not so good at yapping
about my feelings and whatnot.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.694
It's not what I do.

19:33.868 --> 19:36.523
Well, I think
you're doing it right now.

19:36.697 --> 19:38.264
You know, you're pretty smart
for a total idiot.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.227
<i>Getting older can be hard,
no matter what age we are.</i>

19:46.663 --> 19:48.230
Yee-haw!

19:48.404 --> 19:50.276
<i>But the amazing thing is,</i>

19:50.450 --> 19:51.886
<i>that doesn't mean we can't
change for the better.</i>

19:52.060 --> 19:53.975
- Wanna hold her?
- Yes. Oh!

19:55.933 --> 19:59.502
Oh, she's so precious.
You must be so happy, Beverly.

19:59.676 --> 20:02.113
I am. I really am.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.550
And at least now
you've got someone

20:03.724 --> 20:04.942
who's your
intellectual equal.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.770
Gasp! Was that a swipe at me?

20:08.946 --> 20:11.514
Thank you, Jane Bales.

20:11.688 --> 20:14.082
<i>Because no matter how many
candles burn on our cake,</i>

20:14.256 --> 20:16.998
<i>what keeps us young is the fire
that burns in our hearts.</i>

20:18.869 --> 20:20.741
<i>And regardless of
what age we are,</i>

20:20.915 --> 20:23.352
<i>the lessons we learn
along the way
are most special...</i>

20:23.526 --> 20:25.398
- Oh. Aw!
- Ah!

20:25.572 --> 20:27.182
<i>...when we share them
with the people we love.</i>

20:29.402 --> 20:30.794
Whoo-hoo!

20:38.498 --> 20:41.022
Erica, recent events
have caused me to realize

20:41.196 --> 20:44.504
that country music
is incredibly simple
to write and perform.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.332
That's not even
remotely true.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.290
Well, I've written a song
and I want you to record it,

20:48.464 --> 20:50.553
vaulting us both to stardom
as a mother-daughter
country duo.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.381
Give it a whirl.

20:52.555 --> 20:54.601
I can whirl it into
the nearest trash can.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.125
I'll finish folding
all of Muriel's laundry.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.561
Ladies and gentlemen, <i>
Bubbe's Waltz.</i>

21:03.479 --> 21:06.134

21:06.308 --> 21:08.919

<i>♪ She's a bubbe baby

21:23.891 --> 21:24.979
What do you think?

21:25.153 --> 21:26.763
I think
I'm an incredible singer,

21:26.937 --> 21:27.851
and I still can't
make this work.
