01:09.030 --> 01:11.428
What are you doing?

01:11.597 --> 01:13.530
Thinking.

01:17.866 --> 01:19.492
About what?

01:19.667 --> 01:23.828
I was remembering that summer
after Rachel was born.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.468
We put the hammock up in the yard.

01:30.337 --> 01:33.827
All three of us would get in.

01:35.406 --> 01:38.862
We'd a nap together. Remember?

01:39.041 --> 01:40.701
Yeah.

01:42.508 --> 01:45.032
I love you.

01:58.647 --> 02:03.274
Jen, we've been sharing
the same bed for a week.

02:03.449 --> 02:05.938
I'm not ready yet, Mark.

02:22.690 --> 02:25.020
"What a glorious morn.

02:25.190 --> 02:26.952
Night's candles have burnt out...

02:27.124 --> 02:32.217
...and jocund day stands tiptoe
on the misty mountain tops."

02:33.327 --> 02:38.023
I joined a Shakespearean theater
group. I'm going to play Romeo.

02:38.195 --> 02:39.956
- A comic version?
- No.

02:45.664 --> 02:50.064
"But soft! What light through
yonder window breaks?

02:50.233 --> 02:53.496
It is the east and Juliet is the sun!

02:53.667 --> 02:57.395
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon...

02:57.568 --> 03:00.467
...who is already sick
and pale with jealousy."

03:00.636 --> 03:04.967
- Sick and pale is right.
- Nuts to you!

03:07.972 --> 03:11.872
Sorry, I couldn't resist. I picked it
up in New Guinea last summer.

03:13.808 --> 03:16.434
Got a roomful of drunks left over
from the night shift.

03:16.609 --> 03:19.804
- Wanna help wake them up?
- Not really.

03:19.977 --> 03:21.909
Suit yourself.

03:23.644 --> 03:28.408
- First time you've been robbed?
- For two years, no problems. It was time.

03:28.579 --> 03:31.239
- Cleaned you out, huh?
- Yeah, money.

03:31.413 --> 03:34.245
- But not my camera or books.
- That's good.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.677
- Are you single?
- Why?

03:36.849 --> 03:40.805
A lot of good-looking guys here.
Doctors, businessmen...

03:40.984 --> 03:43.815
I run a dating service out of the cab.

03:43.985 --> 03:47.350
- For 10 bucks you're in the book.
- No, thank you.

03:47.519 --> 03:51.885
It works. All these people get married
after meeting through my cab.

03:52.054 --> 03:55.544
This lady runs her own business,
married a lawyer.

03:57.123 --> 04:00.716
- This guy is a doctor.
- Hey, that's Dr. Cvetic!

04:02.058 --> 04:03.752
Oh, my God...

04:03.925 --> 04:06.119
- You know Dr. Div?
- I used to.

04:06.293 --> 04:09.818
This lady owns a chain
of mortuaries. Big bucks.

04:09.995 --> 04:12.291
- She's fine.
- Oh, yeah.

04:12.462 --> 04:15.190
Clean the cut.
I'll have Carter stitch him up.

04:16.396 --> 04:20.194
- Something's wrong?
- That's her old boyfriend.

04:23.899 --> 04:28.094
Write up his aftercare and call
pharmacy with med renewals.

04:29.601 --> 04:31.465
Keep moving.

04:31.636 --> 04:34.728
Hey, you. You get a doughnut?

04:40.438 --> 04:42.405
See you next time.

04:43.940 --> 04:48.499
Simple pleasures. I got your application
for the ER sub-internship.

04:48.675 --> 04:52.506
With recommendation from Lewis
and Greene, but not from you.

04:54.176 --> 04:58.269
I wasn't aware Mr. Carter had
applied for an ER sub-internship.

04:58.444 --> 05:01.434
Yeah, it's sort of a backup.

05:01.612 --> 05:04.909
- So we're not your first choice?
- No, no, no...

05:05.514 --> 05:08.140
I just haven't made up my mind yet...

05:08.315 --> 05:10.941
...between ER and surgery.

05:11.116 --> 05:14.049
Whatever. I need your evaluation
as soon as you can.

06:16.706 --> 06:19.935
- Hey, buddy, you just got here?
- I'm on 8-to-8.

06:20.107 --> 06:21.937
- Six-to-three.
- Nine hours?

06:22.108 --> 06:25.132
I'm assistant coaching
Jake's baseball game.

06:25.309 --> 06:27.936
Baseball? That's a big step
in any relationship.

06:28.110 --> 06:30.975
Hope I don't have to
explain the infield fly rule.

06:31.145 --> 06:34.771
- So how goes Milwaukee?
- Commute's not bad.

06:34.945 --> 06:39.743
- But emotionally, I don't know.
- You're my domestic role model.

06:39.914 --> 06:44.678
- Heard about the attending gig yet?
- No. I'm not holding my breath.

06:44.849 --> 06:49.146
Gentlemen, good timing.
Kid in Three bumped his head.

06:49.318 --> 06:52.752
- What do we have for Dr. Greene?
- I can run the board.

06:52.919 --> 06:56.716
I'd just as soon handle it. Nobody's
taken the knee lac in Five.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.513
Why don't I take it?

06:58.688 --> 07:02.520
I needed a fallback. There's no guarantee
I'm gonna get the surgical sub-I.

07:02.689 --> 07:06.020
- There are no guarantees in life.
- A lady from E.L.S.

07:06.190 --> 07:11.523
Take a message. Write your own
recommendation and I'll sign it.

07:11.693 --> 07:13.818
- Peter.
- What?

07:13.993 --> 07:18.654
It's your student loan service. You're
three months behind on your payments.

07:22.796 --> 07:26.525
OB is on the 4th floor
and your appointment is at 8:30.

07:26.698 --> 07:30.097
Great, I get to sit around
and wait for two hours.

07:30.166 --> 07:34.190
After your checkup go to
Social Services on the main floor.

07:34.367 --> 07:40.131
Ms. Harding will help you apply
for WIC, AFDC and food stamps.

07:43.236 --> 07:45.100
- How do I get home?
- Bus.

07:52.140 --> 07:55.629
- What about lunch?
- I made you an egg salad sandwich.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.866
- I forgot it.
- You forgot it on purpose.

07:59.109 --> 08:00.769
I hate egg salad.

08:02.610 --> 08:07.010
- I'll make dinner for you tonight.
- No, Chloe, don't. Don't!

08:07.179 --> 08:10.010
- John. May I call you John?
- Sure.

08:10.180 --> 08:12.703
Here's a good one for you.
Pretty, huh?

08:13.614 --> 08:15.240
Kind of serious.

08:15.415 --> 08:20.849
Turn-ons are motorcycles and water
sports. Sounds like a wild one.

08:21.017 --> 08:25.576
"Seeks a man who enjoys fine dining,
romantic evenings, must be athletic...

08:25.752 --> 08:28.810
...and pro-death penalty."
I don't know.

08:28.986 --> 08:33.215
- Wanna get in the book, John? Just $ 10!
- No, thanks.

08:33.388 --> 08:37.981
Dr. Lewis wants to x-ray your eye
to make sure there are no fractures.

08:39.323 --> 08:43.519
Hey, you fix me up,
I put you in for free.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.658
So, John, tell me your turn-ons.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.853
What?

08:49.760 --> 08:52.250
- We should've eloped.
- What now?

08:52.428 --> 08:56.885
The woman who's getting married
after us wants to share flowers.

08:57.063 --> 08:59.291
- Why not? Split the cost.
- That's what I said.

08:59.464 --> 09:03.989
She'll only pay a third. The flowers
would be "used" for her wedding.

09:04.165 --> 09:07.826
Between that, the guest list, the
bridesmaid's shoes... It's out of control.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.966
- We have to write our vows.
- Oh, God...

09:10.134 --> 09:13.898
We'll have lunch and figure out
what we're gonna say.

09:19.771 --> 09:22.102
- John?
- Hey, Diane!

09:23.639 --> 09:27.629
Diane Leeds. She helped me beat
a malpractice case a few years ago.

09:27.807 --> 09:32.366
- Which was totally bogus.
- This is my fiancÃ©e, Carol Hathaway.

09:32.542 --> 09:36.237
- I've heard a lot about you.
- From Doug?

09:36.410 --> 09:39.866
- From John.
- Doug?

09:40.045 --> 09:43.945
Well, Diane and Doug Ross
are going out. Am I right?

09:44.114 --> 09:47.444
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, I didn't know that.

09:54.684 --> 09:57.742
- So when's the happ y day?
- May 18th.

09:57.918 --> 10:00.578
- At St. Luke's.
- Beautiful church.

10:00.753 --> 10:03.447
- I love weddings there.
- You should come.

10:03.620 --> 10:06.212
Well, that'd be great.

10:06.388 --> 10:09.014
- I'm gonna go find Doug.
- Good to see you.

10:09.188 --> 10:12.451
- You too, John. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

10:13.157 --> 10:17.818
- Why'd you do that? She'll bring Ross.
- I don't know. It just popped out.

10:19.259 --> 10:22.715
- Give me the bullet.
- High-speed collision with a tree.

10:22.894 --> 10:26.224
- Vitals?
- BP's 110 over 85, pulse 88.

10:26.395 --> 10:29.885
- Responds to pain.
- Pupils are equal and reactive.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.586
Let's get an x-ray in here.
We need a lateral C-spine.

10:33.765 --> 10:36.527
- How's his belly?
- Not rigid, bowel sounds normal.

10:36.699 --> 10:39.461
- Coma score's nine.
- Borderline for brain damage.

10:39.633 --> 10:43.430
He's a contender.
Stand by with Norcuron and Dilantin.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.761
Call for a CT,
make sure no one's on the table.

10:46.635 --> 10:49.068
- How's his pressure?
- Holding.

10:50.937 --> 10:54.301
Excuse me, doctor.
I think you left this in my bedroom.

10:54.471 --> 10:56.836
That's what happens when
I to dress in the dark.

10:57.006 --> 10:58.995
Will there ever come a time...

10:59.173 --> 11:03.971
...when I don't have to slink off in the
wee hours to avoid corrupting your son?

11:04.142 --> 11:08.473
- I certainly hope so.
- So did you change your meeting?

11:08.643 --> 11:12.577
It didn't work.
I'm gonna miss your coaching debut.

11:12.744 --> 11:17.644
- Jake will be disappointed.
- He's thrilled you're gonna be there.

11:17.813 --> 11:20.746
Why is he wearing
his socks inside out?

11:20.914 --> 11:25.974
- Jake's in a kind of a slump.
- Slump? He's hitting triple-zero.

11:26.150 --> 11:29.379
I told him when I hit a slump
I like to change things.

11:29.551 --> 11:31.983
Wear my socks inside out,
anything to turn it around.

11:32.152 --> 11:34.778
I would never have thought of that.

11:34.952 --> 11:38.716
See, it's a good thing
I'm here. Come here.

11:45.689 --> 11:48.588
- Pulse ox?
- Ninety-two.

11:48.757 --> 11:51.122
- Do we have a name?
- Clothes are on the cart.

11:51.292 --> 11:53.622
- Anyone seen X-ray?
- I'll check.

11:53.793 --> 11:57.693
Name's Donald Costanza.
I have a letter here. "Dear Amy."

11:57.860 --> 12:00.952
Single vehicle into a tree,
could be a suicide.

12:01.128 --> 12:04.789
"I gave up everything for you.
Without you I'm already dead."

12:04.963 --> 12:08.021
- Not if I can help it.
- Dr. Greene?

12:08.198 --> 12:10.858
Solo MVA, apparent suicide attempt.

12:11.032 --> 12:13.965
- GCS 9, nonfocal.
- Pulse ox is down to 90.

12:14.133 --> 12:16.964
- Tube him?
- I'm worried about the spine. Airway's okay.

12:17.134 --> 12:20.568
- He needs intubation.
- I want to clear his C-spine.

12:20.736 --> 12:22.861
- Wrong choice. Tube him now.
- I want an x-ray.

12:23.036 --> 12:27.697
I'm not gonna argue with you.
Versed, 4 migs, 10 Norcuron.

12:27.871 --> 12:31.236
Susan, hand me a laryngoscope
and a 7.5 ET tube.

12:31.406 --> 12:33.066
Come on.

12:35.808 --> 12:37.968
In-line traction.

12:48.879 --> 12:52.368
CT on that suicidal car wreck
shows a small subdural bleed.

12:52.547 --> 12:55.309
That's no indication for surgery.

12:57.148 --> 13:00.138
- Any change in his status?
- Still unconscious.

13:00.316 --> 13:03.613
- What do you think?
- Time will tell.

13:03.784 --> 13:07.081
The girl from the letter, Amy,
She's on her way in.

13:07.252 --> 13:09.946
- How'd you find her?
- She called us.

13:11.887 --> 13:16.344
Tell me you didn't get into a pissing match
with Swift and walk out of a trauma.

13:16.522 --> 13:18.148
I did.

13:18.323 --> 13:22.120
Do you want to throw
the attending job out the window?

13:22.291 --> 13:25.918
It's already gone, Doug,
and I don't really care.

13:26.559 --> 13:29.720
Who are you kidding?
You worked seven years for this job.

13:29.893 --> 13:34.793
If you lose it over this petty crap,
buddy, you're a fool.

13:40.664 --> 13:45.894
- Pardon me, are you a doctor?
- Yeah. Unwrap it, let's see.

13:47.467 --> 13:49.763
I was cutting a bagel.

13:49.934 --> 13:52.163
Wiggle your fingers.

13:53.001 --> 13:56.093
Superficial.
Carter, I got another one for you.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.895
Irrigate and stitch.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.628
If I'm not mistaken,
that's Mr. Howard Davis.

14:00.804 --> 14:04.101
Of the "Davis Cardiac Wing"
of this hospital.

14:04.339 --> 14:06.999
- I know you.
- I went to school with your son.

14:07.173 --> 14:10.265
- Johnny Carter. How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

14:10.441 --> 14:14.170
Mr. Davis, William Swift.
Chairman of the Emergency Department.

14:14.343 --> 14:17.276
- We met at the Board of Directors dinner.
- Good to see you.

14:17.444 --> 14:20.570
- Bagel got away.
- They should come with instructions.

14:20.744 --> 14:24.371
Call chief of hand surgery
and get Plastics down here.

14:24.546 --> 14:26.479
Let them know it's Mr. Davis.

14:26.647 --> 14:29.341
- Are you injured anywhere else?
- No.

14:29.515 --> 14:33.346
But I noticed this little bump
in the corner of my eye.

14:33.516 --> 14:36.642
- Jerry, Zimmerman from the Eye Institute.
- Right.

14:36.817 --> 14:40.615
In the meantime, Dr. Benton,
a senior surgical resident...

14:40.786 --> 14:43.480
...will clean and irrigate your wound.

14:43.653 --> 14:44.812
Right this way.

14:44.987 --> 14:47.351
- Can Johnny come along?
- By all means.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.885
Hope it wasn't the hand
that writes the checks.

14:54.624 --> 14:56.613
- Hello?
- What happened?

14:56.791 --> 15:01.316
- Brenda is burning with fever.
- Hey, Brenda, I'm Dr. Ross.

15:01.493 --> 15:04.927
- Can you tell me where it hurts?
- In my head and neck.

15:05.094 --> 15:07.617
Okay. Touch your chin
to your chest.

15:07.795 --> 15:10.591
Petechiae on her arm.
Anyone else feel sick?

15:10.762 --> 15:15.287
Put her in an iso room, get a CBC,
Chem-7 and cultures times three.

15:15.464 --> 15:17.863
- Are you thinking meningitis?
- That's right.

15:18.032 --> 15:20.726
Mother was a nurse
before she started coaching.

15:20.900 --> 15:24.061
- You're mother and daughter?
- They're from St. Josephine's.

15:25.168 --> 15:27.431
They're nuns.

15:27.602 --> 15:30.865
- Mother's a nun. I'm almost a nun.
- Okay.

15:31.036 --> 15:34.993
We'll do a spinal tap on Brenda
to confirm the meningitis.

15:35.172 --> 15:40.003
We'll have to isolate the rest of you
and examine everyone for petechiae...

15:40.173 --> 15:42.504
...these red spots
that indicate infection.

15:42.674 --> 15:45.368
Come on, everybody, this way.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.433
Come on, girls, a little hustle.

15:48.610 --> 15:51.236
I hope everybody brought
their playbook.

16:05.949 --> 16:07.779
- How is he?
- Amy?

16:10.284 --> 16:14.775
He has a severe concussion
and some brain swelling.

16:14.952 --> 16:17.249
Right now he's in a coma.

16:18.721 --> 16:21.119
- Is he gonna be okay?
- We don't know yet.

16:21.822 --> 16:25.414
We have to wait and see
how much he wakes up.

16:27.056 --> 16:31.252
We found a letter he wrote
addressed to you.

16:32.225 --> 16:37.989
- It appears he tried to commit suicide.
- I know. I saw the car.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.991
He did it just down the block
from my place.

16:41.161 --> 16:43.651
Has he done this before?

16:43.829 --> 16:48.525
When we broke up last time he locked
himself in the john and took some pills.

16:48.697 --> 16:51.562
They said it was a cry for help.

16:53.299 --> 16:55.789
I never thought he'd do it for real.

17:02.903 --> 17:06.358
Oh, Donny, you jerk.

17:07.671 --> 17:11.105
Greg wasn't as focused as you.
He dropped out of Brown.

17:11.272 --> 17:16.866
<i>Spent a semester at Sorbonne.</i>
Finally a pal got him a job at Newsweek.

17:17.040 --> 17:20.474
<i>Now he's doing celebrity profiles</i>
for Vanity Fair.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.973
- Well, that's great.
- He seems happ y.

17:27.145 --> 17:30.942
- And you?
- I'm doing pretty good.

17:31.113 --> 17:33.705
I've been training with Dr. Benton here.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.439
- Learned a lot.
- Good.

17:36.614 --> 17:39.047
That's good.

17:39.216 --> 17:41.739
- Do you still ride?
- No. No time.

17:41.917 --> 17:46.613
I'll never forget that dressage
exhibition in senior year prep.

17:46.785 --> 17:50.809
The way you pranced
that horse around the ring.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.782
It was like a ballet.

17:53.954 --> 17:57.183
- What kind of horse was that?
- Icelandic pony.

17:57.355 --> 18:00.220
White, wasn't it?

18:01.224 --> 18:04.657
- I can't believe you remember.
- It made an impression.

18:04.824 --> 18:08.758
And the name...
You'd given it a peculiar name.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.550
What was it?

18:11.727 --> 18:15.354
- Marigold.
- That's right. Marigold.

18:23.631 --> 18:26.393
Power forwards, make sure you post up
at the bottom.

18:26.599 --> 18:28.725
Watch the pick-and-roll in here.

18:28.900 --> 18:33.493
- We'll have to run them into the ground.
- Mother Lawrence?

18:33.669 --> 18:36.363
- How is she?
- She has bacterial meningitis.

18:36.536 --> 18:39.526
We've put her on antibiotics
and she's in Intensive Care.

18:39.704 --> 18:42.899
- Will she be all right?
- I think she'll be fine.

18:43.072 --> 18:47.597
As a precaution we'll examine everyone
and give you a drug called rifampin.

18:47.774 --> 18:52.901
It can be hazardous to pregnancies,
so everybody needs to take a test.

18:56.076 --> 19:00.533
I think Sister Elizabeth and I can be
exempted from that procedure.

19:00.711 --> 19:03.304
But as for the rest of them, definitely.

19:03.479 --> 19:07.207
Doctor, Donny opened his eyes.

19:12.549 --> 19:14.811
Donny, can you hear me?

19:16.016 --> 19:18.677
Follow my finger with your eyes.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.918
Do you remember
what happened to you?

19:25.187 --> 19:27.415
Take a deep breath in.

19:29.522 --> 19:34.286
Tidal volume is good. I'm going
to take the tube out of your throat.

19:34.890 --> 19:38.346
Take a deep breath in, and out.

19:41.626 --> 19:43.525
You all right?

19:43.694 --> 19:44.785
Amy?

19:50.063 --> 19:51.689
Amy...

19:57.432 --> 20:00.558
There's no sign of petechiae here.
You feeling okay?

20:00.733 --> 20:02.824
He's cute.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.660
Okay.

20:07.501 --> 20:09.991
Seven down. Eight to go. Who's next?

20:10.170 --> 20:13.830
Examining all these girls in one day
must be a fantasy come true.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.800
Fifteen years too late.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.470
Oh, shoot. I'll be right back.

20:25.442 --> 20:27.306
- Hi.
- Lunch?

20:27.475 --> 20:31.466
I can't. I've got 15 girls
exposed to meningitis.

20:31.644 --> 20:35.169
- Oh, well, we'll do it tonight.
- I'm going to my mother's.

20:35.345 --> 20:37.676
- What about our vows?
- This weekend?

20:37.846 --> 20:41.041
We're going over them
with the priest on Saturday.

20:41.214 --> 20:44.544
Well, what do you want me to do?

20:44.715 --> 20:47.841
Nothing. Forget it.
Let's just bag the vows.

20:48.016 --> 20:51.177
- Tag, come on...
- Forget it, it's not worth it.

21:04.255 --> 21:07.949
- Do you have a problem with authority?
- Not generally.

21:08.123 --> 21:13.285
When it's enforced arbitrarily and
undermines my authority, I resent it.

21:14.525 --> 21:17.253
Do you feel like
I'm encroaching on you?

21:17.426 --> 21:20.791
Before you got here I ran the board.

21:20.961 --> 21:26.021
I made decisions, and nobody would
contradict me in the middle of a trauma.

21:26.197 --> 21:30.688
- I've stepped on your entitlements?
- You treat me like a med student.

21:30.865 --> 21:34.958
- I've been chief resident for a year.
- You don't act like it.

21:35.400 --> 21:39.128
Morgenstern told me you were
the most impressive resident he'd seen.

21:39.301 --> 21:42.860
I'm thinking, "Is this the same guy?"

21:43.036 --> 21:45.332
You come in late,
your attitude's bad.

21:45.503 --> 21:47.993
It's like you don't want to be here.

21:48.171 --> 21:51.433
I don't stand in front of the board
all day because I want to.

21:51.605 --> 21:56.096
I do it because, from what I've seen,
your head's not in the game.

22:08.544 --> 22:09.533
Hi.

22:12.580 --> 22:15.741
The nurse said he's gonna be okay.

22:15.914 --> 22:19.075
He can carry a conversation.
His memory is intact.

22:19.249 --> 22:21.306
It looks good.

22:22.317 --> 22:25.909
- He's been asking about you.
- I'll bet.

22:28.885 --> 22:31.818
I wanna see him, but I don't want
to take care of him.

22:32.153 --> 22:37.349
- He'll be able to take care of himself.
- You don't know Donny. He's got problems.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.785
He gambles. I don't even know
how much he owes.

22:40.957 --> 22:45.414
He's got this way of sucking you in
and getting you to do stuff.

22:45.592 --> 22:48.491
If he wasn't so sweet
I would've killed him myself.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.422
- Lf you want to see a therapist...
- I've done it.

22:51.594 --> 22:55.152
That's why I'm getting on a plane
in three hours.

22:55.328 --> 22:57.557
This is it.

23:03.031 --> 23:08.125
I'm just so afraid he's gonna do it
again. You know, really do it.

23:11.768 --> 23:13.734
It's not easy.

23:13.901 --> 23:17.426
Donny's the first guy
who really cared about me.

23:18.337 --> 23:20.997
But I can't be responsible.

23:21.171 --> 23:25.298
- Will you give him that? Will you?
- Sure.

23:32.441 --> 23:34.431
Hey, Malik?

23:34.609 --> 23:39.168
Will you give the girls of St. Jo's
their first dose of rifampin?

23:39.344 --> 23:42.937
- So nobody is pregnant?
- No. Hallelujah.

23:46.147 --> 23:48.739
Chloe? Are you there?

23:48.914 --> 23:54.576
It's me. Call me when you get in. I want
to hear how everything went today.

23:54.749 --> 23:57.773
I hate not knowing where she is.
Leaves too much to the imagination.

23:57.950 --> 24:03.044
- Are you your sister's keeper?
- I didn't exactly volunteer.

24:03.219 --> 24:07.949
- Did you settle things with Swift?
- No, but we did share our feelings.

24:08.120 --> 24:12.145
He thinks I need an attitude
adjustment, which I probably do.

24:12.322 --> 24:13.948
You don't disagree.

24:14.123 --> 24:16.555
- Carter, did you pick up Taylor's film?
- Ready in five.

24:16.724 --> 24:19.122
You can go to lunch after.
Twenty minutes.

24:19.291 --> 24:23.350
Dr. Benton, you got a call
from some loan service.

24:23.527 --> 24:27.153
- I have to start repaying next month.
- How much do you owe?

24:27.327 --> 24:30.385
- Eighty-five thousand.
- One hundred and ten.

24:30.562 --> 24:33.586
Must be nice not to have
to worry about loans, huh, Carter?

24:36.664 --> 24:39.097
I'll check on these films.

24:40.666 --> 24:44.497
- Is Carter loaded?
- He went to school with Davis' son.

24:44.667 --> 24:47.828
- Are we talking millions?
- Or tens of millions?

24:48.568 --> 24:51.092
- Peter, got a two-fer.
- Let's hear it.

24:51.270 --> 24:54.066
Apparently, this one did it on a dare.

24:54.237 --> 24:59.762
When the paramedics asked what happened,
this one reenacted the crime.

24:59.939 --> 25:03.771
- Do we have names?
- Yeah, Dumb and Dumber.

25:04.340 --> 25:09.297
We need 4x4s, 5.0 nylon.
We're okay on everything else.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.701
Man, I'm tired.

25:13.877 --> 25:18.174
- Not getting enough sleep?
- Maybe four hours a night.

25:18.345 --> 25:22.439
- Why's that?
- The wedding. So much to do.

25:22.614 --> 25:25.137
- And so little time.
- Two weeks.

25:28.717 --> 25:31.149
Before you got married,
didn't you wonder...

25:31.317 --> 25:35.546
...if this was the person you were meant
to spend the rest of your life with?

25:36.419 --> 25:38.510
I never had any doubts about Earl.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.416
And after four years he split.

25:42.354 --> 25:46.515
I can't imagine Tag doing that.
He's a terrific guy, Carol.

25:51.357 --> 25:53.153
Excuse me, Nurse Hathaway.

25:53.325 --> 25:56.724
- May I speak with you privately?
- Sure.

26:05.162 --> 26:08.027
- I haven't taken these yet.
- Why not?

26:08.831 --> 26:12.162
It's possible that I may be pregnant.

26:16.366 --> 26:19.800
- I'll need to take a test.
- All right.

26:27.270 --> 26:30.829
What happened? What happened?
We need a translator.

26:33.306 --> 26:36.034
His son was playing
with a hanger.

26:36.207 --> 26:37.867
He told him not to.

26:39.274 --> 26:40.968
Don't cry.

26:45.010 --> 26:47.272
Keep your eye on the ball.

26:47.444 --> 26:49.377
Jake, come on, buddy.

26:52.846 --> 26:55.211
That's okay, Jake.
Keep your eye on the ball.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.313
Shake it off. Here we go.

26:57.481 --> 27:01.210
That's okay, Jake.
Keep your eye on the ball.

27:01.382 --> 27:06.316
You got him, buddy. Let's go.
The socks are gonna work.

27:06.485 --> 27:08.474
Jake, come on, buddy.

27:11.053 --> 27:13.144
Run, run, go!

27:13.820 --> 27:16.651
Run it out! Muff! Muff it!

27:16.821 --> 27:19.219
Three out!

27:19.388 --> 27:22.651
Come here. You got a piece of it.
That was a good try.

27:22.823 --> 27:25.722
Go get your mitt. Here you go.

27:27.258 --> 27:29.953
<i>SeÃ±or, hold his head.</i>

27:33.327 --> 27:37.284
Connie, get over here.
Hold on to that thigh, Wendy.

27:39.296 --> 27:42.820
Coat hanger's pierced
the posterior oropharynx.

27:42.997 --> 27:45.521
- Throat's swelling up.
- It's near the carotid.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.359
- What else's in there?
- It's off to the left.

27:50.167 --> 27:51.894
- Phrenic nerve?
- Lingual artery.

27:52.067 --> 27:55.933
- Too much going on in the neck.
- Hold him still!

27:57.469 --> 27:59.527
I see blood. He needs an airway.

27:59.703 --> 28:01.363
Prep for a needle crike.

28:01.537 --> 28:06.437
- Malik, get some bolt-cutters.
- Tell O.R. We're on our way.

28:16.710 --> 28:18.801
Sister?

28:20.911 --> 28:23.104
The test was negative.

28:23.278 --> 28:26.541
- So I'm not?
- No.

28:33.882 --> 28:36.179
Are you all right?

28:42.018 --> 28:45.281
Part of me was hoping that I was.

28:52.722 --> 28:56.781
There's a man, obviously.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.451
He wants me to marry him,
but I'm not sure.

29:04.627 --> 29:08.958
For two and a half years I've been
preparing to devote my life to God.

29:10.495 --> 29:14.190
I don't know which path
He wants me to take.

29:15.464 --> 29:20.228
And if I make the wrong choice...

29:28.568 --> 29:31.592
If I were pregnant
the decision would be made.

29:38.038 --> 29:41.528
- Pulse ox falling, 88.
- Open a suction set.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.167
He's not breathing.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.671
- Throat's swollen shut.
- Crike him!

29:46.841 --> 29:49.741
- Fourteen-gauge needle.
- Get a peds ambu bag.

29:51.943 --> 29:56.240
Stick in a number three ET hub
and bag him.

29:56.411 --> 29:59.901
- Bleeding's worse.
- Let's close it off.

30:00.079 --> 30:02.978
- 3.0 Vicryl.
- Suction!

30:03.147 --> 30:05.046
Needle holder.

30:09.750 --> 30:11.909
- Got a clear angle?
- Yeah.

30:13.018 --> 30:15.985
Pulse ox is improving, 85.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.553
Okay, tie it off.

30:24.721 --> 30:26.779
Let me get it out of your way.

30:28.856 --> 30:31.914
- Can you get that?
- How about that?

30:32.090 --> 30:34.580
- Great. Retract.
- Got it.

30:34.759 --> 30:38.157
- It's holding.
- O.R. Is standing by.

30:38.326 --> 30:40.350
Get him upstairs.

30:40.527 --> 30:43.824
Tell him we're taking him to surgery
to get the metal piece out.

30:47.863 --> 30:50.955
Santi will be fine.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.861
- Carter, what are you working on?
- Evaluation.

31:00.034 --> 31:02.058
- Of what?
- Me.

31:03.602 --> 31:07.627
- Some kind of self-help exercise?
- It's for my ER sub-I application.

31:07.803 --> 31:10.964
Benton told me to write it myself.

31:12.039 --> 31:15.665
- How do you feel about yourself?
- I'd rather not.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.773
Carter, come on, let me see.

31:22.509 --> 31:26.238
Conscientious, hardworking...

31:26.410 --> 31:28.639
...earnest and ever-punctual?

31:28.811 --> 31:32.006
It sounds like a recommendation
for a train conductor.

31:32.179 --> 31:34.771
Seriously, Benton could do better.

31:37.514 --> 31:40.811
<i>Got it!</i>
Chicago Magazine's "Rich List."

31:40.982 --> 31:43.245
The 50 fattest cats in town.

31:43.416 --> 31:47.282
- Where did you find it?
- Med Library. Check out 27.

31:47.451 --> 31:50.782
- No!
- His father's name's Roland.

31:50.953 --> 31:56.581
- What does it say?
- Net worth 178 million!

31:56.754 --> 31:59.516
He can get everyone here a mill
and not even feel it.

31:59.689 --> 32:02.178
- I wish I'd been nicer to him.
- Peter?

32:03.890 --> 32:07.915
- Peter?
- Jeanie, how are you?

32:08.092 --> 32:11.490
- I'm not interrupting?
- No, of course not.

32:11.659 --> 32:13.888
- What's up?
- I have a favor to ask.

32:14.061 --> 32:17.222
I'm taking courses to become
a physician's assistant.

32:17.395 --> 32:22.091
I have to write a paper on nosocomial
infections in postoperative patients.

32:22.263 --> 32:26.095
- You picked this topic yourself?
- No, it was assigned.

32:26.265 --> 32:29.096
I was worried there for a second.

32:30.867 --> 32:33.163
- How can I help?
- I need a case study.

32:33.334 --> 32:36.097
I thought you might know
of some cases.

32:36.268 --> 32:40.828
I think I can throw a few
nosocomial infections your way.

32:41.003 --> 32:44.528
- How's your mom?
- You know, the same.

32:46.239 --> 32:48.536
I'm seeing her tonight around 7:30.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.935
I was planning on stopping by myself.

32:54.508 --> 32:57.703
- So maybe I'll see you.
- Great. See you.

33:00.110 --> 33:01.770
See you.

33:02.211 --> 33:04.871
All right! Here we go.

33:05.646 --> 33:07.203
Come on, Jake. Come on!

33:08.913 --> 33:11.779
- Strike!
- I can feel the breeze out here.

33:11.947 --> 33:14.346
Don't worry about it, Jake.
Wait for your pitch.

33:14.515 --> 33:15.811
Come on, buddy.

33:17.183 --> 33:21.174
All right, Jake. Come on, buddy.
You got them. Let's go,

33:21.351 --> 33:24.648
Those socks are gonna do it.
Come on. Let's go.

33:24.819 --> 33:26.479
You got it.

33:33.855 --> 33:35.287
Go! Go on, go!

33:35.456 --> 33:38.514
Run, Jake! Come on! Let's go!

33:38.690 --> 33:41.351
Run, Jake! Come on. Go!

33:41.524 --> 33:44.549
- He missed the bag!
- Go! Go on!

33:44.726 --> 33:46.249
Go, Jake! Come on!

33:48.194 --> 33:51.684
- He missed the bag.
- Let's go, Jake! Come on, go! Go!

33:53.630 --> 33:55.324
Let's go! Come on!

33:58.265 --> 34:00.561
- Slide! Slide!
- He's safe!

34:03.532 --> 34:05.590
- He never touched first!
- What?

34:05.767 --> 34:08.791
- He missed the bag by a mile!
- First-base coach?

34:08.967 --> 34:12.264
- Did he touch the bag or not?
- Yeah, he touched the bag!

34:12.436 --> 34:14.163
Call's good. Home run.

34:15.703 --> 34:20.103
This guy's a liar!
You're a liar! You cheat!

34:20.273 --> 34:22.431
- Batter up!
- You cheat!

34:29.576 --> 34:31.940
You want a hamburger
and a shake?

34:32.110 --> 34:34.303
I'm not hungry.

34:41.313 --> 34:44.474
Okay, I screwed up.
I got caught up in the excitement.

34:44.648 --> 34:48.911
- And I did the wrong thing.
- You lied.

34:50.549 --> 34:55.141
Yes, I did, and there's
no excuse for that.

34:56.685 --> 35:01.847
You know, what I just did was
what my old man would've done.

35:02.021 --> 35:05.476
He's a good guy in a lot of ways.
He's just...

35:09.423 --> 35:12.390
Maybe I'm not very good
at this father stuff.

35:12.557 --> 35:14.716
I'm sorry that I let you down.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.218
So should we tell Mom about this?

35:22.395 --> 35:24.953
I don't know, what do you think?

35:25.129 --> 35:27.096
Maybe not.

35:29.530 --> 35:31.622
Come on, let's get out of here.

35:31.797 --> 35:35.731
I promised your mom
I'd have you back before she got off.

35:35.899 --> 35:37.297
Hey, Jake...

35:38.300 --> 35:40.426
It was a hell of a hit.

35:42.868 --> 35:44.459
Dr. Benton?

35:44.635 --> 35:49.831
If my evaluation meets with your
approval I need you to sign it.

35:52.571 --> 35:55.095
- What do you want from me?
- I don't want anything from you.

35:55.272 --> 35:59.899
- The question is, what do you want?
- I want the surgical sub-internship.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.769
- Why?
- So that I can be a surgical resident.

36:02.942 --> 36:05.933
And why is that important to you?

36:07.244 --> 36:10.768
Because surgery is
the most difficult specialty.

36:10.945 --> 36:14.310
There's more pressure,
you have to know more, do...

36:14.479 --> 36:18.879
I don't know if I'm capable of being
a surgeon, and I want to find out.

36:19.048 --> 36:22.140
Then why are you applying
for an ER sub-internship?

36:30.218 --> 36:32.378
See you in the morning.

36:42.489 --> 36:46.150
- How was the game?
- The good guys won.

36:46.325 --> 36:49.758
- I'm gonna go call Mom.
- Okay, you do that.

36:49.925 --> 36:53.859
- Listen, about what I said earlier...
- Forget it.

36:54.027 --> 36:56.823
It's okay. You were right.

36:56.995 --> 37:00.792
- So how is family life?
- It's great. He's great, she's great.

37:00.963 --> 37:06.829
Tonight I'm looking forward to sitting
in my Stratolounger with my beer...

37:06.998 --> 37:10.022
...watching Irish hurling on ESPN.

37:11.599 --> 37:12.997
Gentlemen.

37:13.167 --> 37:17.624
"Farewell, good night.
Till it be morrow."

37:22.403 --> 37:24.927
Is the N.E.A. Funding that?

37:31.107 --> 37:33.801
- Ready?
- Almost.

37:35.275 --> 37:37.469
What's that?

37:39.710 --> 37:44.110
- Marriage vows. My half, anyway.
- Thought you didn't want to bother.

37:47.312 --> 37:49.336
Let's hear.

37:51.481 --> 37:54.107
"Carol."

37:54.282 --> 37:57.874
Actually, I left it blank at the top
in case I need to change it.

37:59.150 --> 38:00.673
Keep going.

38:02.418 --> 38:07.114
"Before we were together I'd been
in love many times, or so I thought.

38:07.286 --> 38:11.084
But now I know you're the only one
I've ever truly loved.

38:11.254 --> 38:14.415
The only one I can imagine
spending my life with.

38:14.589 --> 38:20.387
The one I can't imagine
spending my life without."

38:21.257 --> 38:23.417
That's as far as I got.

38:26.326 --> 38:27.792
It's beautiful.

38:31.862 --> 38:34.886
So do you feel the same way?

38:35.396 --> 38:37.158
Of course.

38:37.764 --> 38:41.891
You don't seem too happ y lately.
You're up half the night.

38:42.632 --> 38:47.759
I love you and I wanna marry you, okay?

38:55.470 --> 38:59.131
- I can't believe I missed it!
- When this kid breaks a slump, he breaks it.

38:59.305 --> 39:02.136
Let's celebrate.
I'll get some brat and kraut.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.466
- And the good kind of rolls.
- Yeah.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.368
- You want to man the grill?
- I'm riding with Doug.

39:09.842 --> 39:12.139
I love you.

39:14.043 --> 39:16.306
I love you too.

39:19.679 --> 39:24.579
- Why is Ma's door closed?
- She's getting a sponge bath.

39:25.214 --> 39:28.648
- Who's in there?
- Just the nurse.

39:31.017 --> 39:34.075
- She just left.
- Who?

39:35.751 --> 39:37.650
You know who.

39:37.818 --> 39:40.251
She's married, man.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.648
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Right.

39:43.820 --> 39:48.447
That's why when she comes around
you start talking like Barry White.

39:48.622 --> 39:52.215
"Hey, baby. What's up?"

39:52.391 --> 39:55.825
And that look she gives you...

39:55.991 --> 39:59.322
Hope you know
what you're doing, man.

40:00.060 --> 40:03.550
<i>Darling, I...</i>

40:03.727 --> 40:07.923
<i>... can 't get enough</i>
of your love, baby

40:08.096 --> 40:11.393
<i>I don 't know why, I don 't know why,</i>
I don 't know why...

40:11.563 --> 40:15.361
<i>... I can 't get enough</i>
of your love, baby

40:26.503 --> 40:30.028
- Aren't you out of here yet?
- Yeah, almost.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.139
I'm here, baby.

40:41.474 --> 40:44.134
I'm not going anywhere.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.739
I'm here.

40:51.612 --> 40:55.705
<i>By being great marriage material,</i>
do you want to get married?

40:55.880 --> 40:58.176
<i>Yeah, I'm ready for it.</i>

40:58.347 --> 41:00.337
<i>- How old are you?</i>
- Thirty.

41:00.515 --> 41:04.812
<i>What makes you think</i>
you're great marriage material?

41:04.983 --> 41:08.508
<i>I was a Boy Scout,</i>
ages 11 through 18...

41:08.684 --> 41:11.378
How was your day?

41:12.685 --> 41:15.243
You read the article on smoking
and low birth rate?

41:15.420 --> 41:17.546
I'm gonna stop, okay?

41:23.556 --> 41:27.785
- How was the checkup?
- That doctor was so irresponsible.

41:27.957 --> 41:30.584
I waited two hours.

41:31.325 --> 41:35.123
- You didn't stay?
- Two hours, Susie.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.953
I can't do this anymore.

41:39.962 --> 41:41.655
Sue?

41:41.829 --> 41:44.296
Suz?

41:44.830 --> 41:48.127
- You need to get your own place.
- What?

41:48.298 --> 41:51.788
You can't stay here,
not after the baby is born.

41:51.966 --> 41:55.263
But, Susie, I'm naming her after you.

41:55.435 --> 42:00.664
- And for that I have to support you?
- Yeah, a few months, maybe.

42:00.836 --> 42:02.496
No.

42:04.271 --> 42:07.534
- You're throwing me out?
- Oh, God!

42:07.705 --> 42:10.604
My own sister!

42:10.773 --> 42:14.934
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
guilt me into taking care of you again.

42:15.108 --> 42:18.269
Come on, Susie,
you're making good money.

42:18.443 --> 42:20.671
You're not even here half the time.

42:20.843 --> 42:24.902
Damn it, I've spent my whole life
bailing you out and I've had it!

42:25.079 --> 42:27.568
No more! This is it!

42:33.047 --> 42:35.310
Where am I supposed to go?

42:35.482 --> 42:38.847
You're 34 years old, Chloe.
Figure something out.

43:02.058 --> 43:04.217
You're John Carter.

43:05.859 --> 43:08.622
Melanie Graff. Radiology.

43:08.793 --> 43:11.659
We sent down some orbital films
on a Russian cab driver.

43:11.828 --> 43:14.489
I need them back for our files.

43:20.298 --> 43:23.959
I saw you in the cabbie's book.

43:25.066 --> 43:28.033
Actually, that's the reason
I came down here.

43:30.335 --> 43:32.733
Wanna get something to eat?

43:36.937 --> 43:39.131
You do speak English, don't you?

43:42.506 --> 43:45.098
You're kind of weird.

43:49.108 --> 43:52.200
- Mark?
- It's me.

43:54.877 --> 43:58.469
- Did you eat?
- I had a sandwich at the hospital.

44:00.545 --> 44:04.377
- Where are you going?
- Living room. Gonna read.

44:05.013 --> 44:06.775
Do you have to?

44:35.891 --> 44:38.654
- Did you hear something?
- No.

44:43.927 --> 44:45.826
Daddy?

44:47.429 --> 44:51.487
- Go back to bed, sweetheart.
- My tummy hurts.

44:51.663 --> 44:53.425
I'll be in in a minute.

44:53.598 --> 44:57.998
But my tummy hurts.
I want Daddy to fix it.

44:59.266 --> 45:00.789
Come here, sugarplum.

45:03.602 --> 45:07.228
- Where does it hurt?
- Here.

45:07.402 --> 45:10.164
Can I come in?

45:11.904 --> 45:13.268
Okay.

45:13.872 --> 45:15.566
Come on.

45:20.374 --> 45:22.306
Sorry.

45:23.208 --> 45:25.198
It's okay.

45:25.942 --> 45:29.307
You have to be quiet, though.
No talking.

45:31.611 --> 45:34.942
- Daddy?
- What is it, sweetie?

45:35.112 --> 45:37.306
I'm glad you're home.

45:38.580 --> 45:40.444
So am I.
