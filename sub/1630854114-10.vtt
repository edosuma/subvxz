WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:07.475
I know I was afraid of matcha,
but it's delicious.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.043
When I first met you,

00:09.143 --> 00:12.080
all you drank
was coffee with five sugars.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.949
That's what ruined my heart
and led me to you.

00:16.050 --> 00:19.753
Every day I thank God
for your clogged arteries.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.922
Zip me up.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.393
It looks nice, Mummy.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.927
You want to get out of there
any time soon,

00:27.027 --> 00:28.262
you better sell it
a little more.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.898
It is very flattering.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.401
I think I liked
the green one better.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.936
The green one
was three stores ago.

00:36.904 --> 00:39.573
I will change and
you will drive me back there.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.476
Wow, I thought my day sucked.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.112
Come on, we're having fun.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.879
You're right.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.382
Yay.
After this,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.118
I got a hair appointment,
and then

00:50.218 --> 00:52.753
you're gonna take me to
a steak dinner to show me off.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.956
Maybe we could join you
at the steakhouse.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.991
I want Chinese food.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.794
Mom, how about
Chinese food?

01:00.894 --> 01:02.563
Look at these nails.
You expect me

01:02.663 --> 01:04.932
to dip them in duck sauce?

01:05.032 --> 01:06.400
We'll see you at home.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.401
I miss you.

01:07.501 --> 01:08.636
I miss you, too.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.404
Abishola, my brassiere

01:10.504 --> 01:12.206
is stuck in the zipper.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.341
I have to go.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.109
I need two hands for this.

01:41.369 --> 01:44.004
I've been waiting
for this all day.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.639
Mmm. Me, too.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.210
You know, there might be a way
we don't have to spend

01:49.310 --> 01:51.845
quite as much of our free time
with our moms

01:51.945 --> 01:53.481
because, even though
we love them

01:53.581 --> 01:54.648
and we are honored to...

01:54.748 --> 01:56.784
Just tell me
your plan.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.519
Dele's turning 16 soon.

01:58.619 --> 02:01.455
I think it's about time he gets
his granny chauffeur license.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.691
Oh, I see.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.593
No.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.261
He can run errands for us.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.497
We could send him
to the post office,

02:09.597 --> 02:10.898
to the grocery store...

02:10.998 --> 02:12.433
You want to risk my son's life

02:12.533 --> 02:15.203
so you do not have
to go to Costco?

02:16.537 --> 02:19.072
Look, cars are safer
than ever now.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.574
The other day,
I was reading a text,

02:20.674 --> 02:22.976
car stopped itself
before I clipped a dog walker.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.845
You were texting while driving?

02:24.945 --> 02:27.915
Good thing Dele's not me.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.117
You raised a kid
who follows the rules.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.985
I have no doubt
he would be a safe driver.

02:32.085 --> 02:33.621
There you go.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.456
I'm gonna make him a "first time
behind the wheel" playlist.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.658
Do you know if Dele
likes Roy Orbison?

02:37.758 --> 02:39.760
He's not ready to drive yet.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.295
Okay,

02:41.395 --> 02:42.930
imagine we're both at work,

02:43.030 --> 02:44.432
Mom cuts her hand
in the kitchen.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.867
Which mom?
I'm not picky.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.168
There's blood everywhere.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.803
Okay, they called 911.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.506
The ambulance is taking too
long. Who's gonna save them?

02:52.606 --> 02:55.643
I've trained Dele to handle
most medical emergencies.

02:55.743 --> 02:58.178
Of course.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.588
Working through
lunch, huh?

03:07.688 --> 03:08.789
Yeah.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.391
I remember that.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.326
Now, I spend my whole break
trying to scrub

03:12.426 --> 03:14.695
the garbage juice
off my hands.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.632
Goodwin's gonna kill me.
Why?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
I just found out that
a vendor's been underpaying us

03:20.334 --> 03:21.769
for five years.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.472
Look, they're locked in
our system at an old rate.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.139
Yeah, well,
that's not your fault.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.641
You think he's gonna
see it that way?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.677
Oh, uh, hey, Goodwin, FYI,

03:29.777 --> 03:31.912
we've been bleeding money
for half a decade.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.748
Oh, thank
you, Douglas. I love bad news.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.984
How about when he
doesn't laugh at your jokes,

03:37.084 --> 03:38.586
and then he says:

03:38.686 --> 03:40.754
That was
amusing. Now, get back to work.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.623
There's no pleasing
the guy.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.157
Work is not for pleasure.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.193
Keep your smiles
at home.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.796
Okay, stop.
I-I don't know what to do.

03:48.896 --> 03:52.165
Well, when I was in management
and I had to deliver bad news,

03:52.266 --> 03:54.134
I found it was
best received

03:54.234 --> 03:55.603
if I coupled it
with a solution.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.438
That's smart.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.840
So, if you were
in my position,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.476
what would
your solution be?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.546
Well, uh, I would get the vendor
on the phone... Okay.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.748
...and incentivize
a re-initiation.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.384
What?
Okay,

04:10.484 --> 04:12.085
you know when your
cable company calls

04:12.185 --> 04:13.487
and they offer you
extra channels,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.022
and you're like,
"Heck yeah, I'll watch

04:15.122 --> 04:17.090
some French game shows."

04:17.190 --> 04:18.359
But then you
don't realize

04:18.459 --> 04:20.561
they roped you
into a new contract.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.631
That's great, so we just
screw them over.

04:23.731 --> 04:27.435
Mm-mm-mm.
Incentivize re-initiation.

04:27.535 --> 04:30.371
Thank you. Goodwin's
gonna love this.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.573
Well done, Douglas.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.542
No, no, it's
Douglas.
No, it's... Douglas.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.577
Douglas. Douglas.
Douglas. Douglas.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.715
Douglas.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.721
I cannot believe Dele's
old enough to drive.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.657
Because he is not.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.293
It seems like yesterday he was
calling me Auntie Kem-Kem.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.228
Now, his voice
has got so deep,

04:55.329 --> 04:57.064
when I call you at home
and he answers,

04:57.164 --> 04:59.066
I think it is you.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.102
Because of the deep,
masculine voice.

05:03.036 --> 05:06.674
When my son was 15,
he opened the car door for me,

05:06.774 --> 05:09.710
and that's when I knew
he had become a man.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.179
My son was opening doors
as soon as he could walk.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.514
Mine, too.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.350
I'm sorry your son
was so disrespectful.

05:17.885 --> 05:20.521
When I look at Dele,
I still see the ten-pound baby

05:20.621 --> 05:22.790
that nearly ripped me in half.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.827
I remember how upset I was
when Funmbi moved away.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.796
Thank God I have other children.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.531
I only have Dele.

05:30.631 --> 05:34.435
And as I've told you before, mistake.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.337
Before you know it,
he'll be off

05:37.438 --> 05:39.740
to college, starting his
career, getting married.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.875
Stop listing things.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.713
It's okay, Abishola. One day
he will give you grandchildren,

05:45.813 --> 05:49.550
and you will have a whole new
generation to control.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.820
Thank you, Kemi.
Mm-hmm.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.027
MaxDot Manufacturing.
Bob Wheeler.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.361
Hello, Bob.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.231
The phones are officially
up and running.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.265
Thank you.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.768
You are welcome.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.970
Okay, we can hang up now.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.972
Okay.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.207
Hey, what was your first car?

06:14.307 --> 06:16.877
Powder blue
Peugeot 404.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.145
What's a Peugeot?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.180
It is a French car.
Any good?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.650
It is a French car.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.019
Mine was a maroon '67 Impala.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.287
Automatic or stick?

06:27.387 --> 06:28.756
What do you take me for? Stick.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.525
Well, I never know with
you Americans. You act as if

06:31.625 --> 06:34.762
you are afraid to drive
with two feet.

06:34.862 --> 06:38.165
My dad taught me at a
cemetery. Nice paved road,

06:38.265 --> 06:39.332
no cars,

06:39.433 --> 06:41.602
and we got to say hi
to Pop-Pop.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.071
My first time driving was...

06:44.171 --> 06:46.006
1968.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.641
Nigeria had once again failed

06:47.741 --> 06:49.543
to qualify
for the African Cup.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.946
And, naturally, my father
was blind drunk.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.415
Naturally.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.519
But someone had to get him
to church,

06:58.619 --> 07:01.822
so he tossed the keys
to 12-year-old Babatunde,

07:01.922 --> 07:03.423
and in that moment,

07:03.524 --> 07:05.526
I became a man.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.496
Abishola won't even let Dele
sit in the front seat.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.698
Well, if you were
raising a child

07:10.798 --> 07:13.501
in another part of the world,
on your own,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.402
how would you behave?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.437
But she's not
on her own anymore.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.040
I know that,
you know that,

07:20.140 --> 07:23.777
but most importantly,
she does not care what we know.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.748
Dele needs to experience the
independence a car gives you.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.418
The freedom of putting your foot
on the gas and just going.

07:31.519 --> 07:34.287
Yes, there is nothing quite like

07:34.387 --> 07:36.356
the wind blowing
through your afro.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.293
An afro and a French car?
Man, you were living.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.297
You have no idea.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.236
And, unfortunately,
the holiday socks

07:49.336 --> 07:51.004
did not sell as well as hoped.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.173
Kofo, I told you socks

07:53.273 --> 07:55.042
would not make
a good stocking stuffer.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.979
And you are right
once again, sir.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.181
Anything else?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.384
Uh, I have something.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.020
Turns out, one of our
bigger accounts

08:07.120 --> 08:09.690
has been massively
underpaying us for a while.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.659
What do you mean "a while"?

08:11.759 --> 08:14.327
It really doesn't matter.
No length of time is acceptable,

08:14.427 --> 08:16.096
be it a week or five years.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.197
Five years?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.999
My stocking stuffers

08:19.099 --> 08:20.668
do not seem so bad now.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.636
I have a solution.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.037
We can make
the money back

08:24.137 --> 08:25.539
by incentivizing

08:25.639 --> 08:28.542
a re-initiation.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.510
That is very smart.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.646
It's the same thing
a cable company does.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.214
I am familiar with the concept.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.550
Okay, not everybody is.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.151
Excellent work, Douglas.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.653
This is the type

08:39.753 --> 08:42.690
of creative thinking
we need in this company.

08:42.790 --> 08:43.891
Thank you.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.292
You saved the day.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.960
Thank you.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.397
Yeah, way to go, Douglas.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.700
Thank you.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.036
Uh, Christina.
Yes?

08:56.136 --> 08:57.537
Could you vacuum my car?

08:57.638 --> 09:00.007
I made the mistake
of giving my son a croissant.

09:01.474 --> 09:03.410
Was there chocolate?
Yes.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.949
Good job, Christina.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.122
So, how'd you do on that
algebra quiz today?

09:15.222 --> 09:16.924
A-plus
and extra credit.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.792
How about that cute girl
in your science class?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.060
Did you say, "What's good"?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.063
We just say
"hello" now.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.866
Can't go wrong with a classic.

09:30.003 --> 09:30.971
What are you doing?

09:31.071 --> 09:34.374
I am gonna teach
you to drive.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.877
No, thank you.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.545
The first time's
always a little scary,

09:38.646 --> 09:40.013
but you'll be fine.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.314
Mom wouldn't
like this.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.184
She's not here.
It's just you, me,

09:44.284 --> 09:47.354
and a quarter-mile of open road
until the school zone.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.790
Really, it's okay.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.027
Humor me, will you?
This is a big stepdad moment.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.597
I've never tried sushi.
We could do that.

09:57.698 --> 10:00.267
Men don't bond over
raw fish, Dele.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.835
Come on,
do it for me.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.103
I'm not ready.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.072
You're as ready as you'll
let yourself be.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.507
I already know
how to drive.
What?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.077
My dad taught me
when I was in Nigeria.

10:10.177 --> 10:13.046
Oh. Okay.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.282
Did you have fun?

10:15.382 --> 10:16.650
It was awesome.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.085
He took me to the same road
that he learned on.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.987
That's nice.

10:20.087 --> 10:23.356
I was nervous, but he talked me
through it, and it went great.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.425
Good for him.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.296
He even made me
a special playlist.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.864
Oh, come on.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.073
All right, stick to
the side streets.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.842
I'm not afraid
of the highway.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.276
No rush to get back
to your mom.

10:43.376 --> 10:46.246
No one jogs
to the electric chair.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.717
Ever heard of
a turn signal?

10:51.451 --> 10:55.122
Wow, your dad even
taught you road rage.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.424
I wanted to teach you that.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.960
I was just doing
what he told me.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.495
I get it.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.197
You seem upset.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.366
I wanted to be the one
to teach you

11:06.466 --> 11:08.201
to drive behind your mom's back.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.370
There are other things
you could teach me.

11:10.470 --> 11:13.807
If you think I'm buying you
a beer, you're too young.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.376
That's okay,
my dad already bought...

11:16.476 --> 11:18.178
Oh, come on.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.021
You got a problem.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.262
Hey.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.964
Hi, there.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.598
Is that
my cheesecake?

11:40.500 --> 11:43.403
Well, would you look at that.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.374
I'm sorry, I got caught up
in the attaboy,

11:47.474 --> 11:48.641
but if I'd said
it was you,

11:48.742 --> 11:49.843
it would've been
an "atta-both of us,"

11:49.943 --> 11:51.678
and that's
not as good.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.446
What about personal integrity?

11:53.546 --> 11:56.216
Ethics? Moral courage?
Oh, come on, Christina,

11:56.316 --> 11:58.685
I don't have
any of that.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.122
God, you suck.
You truly suck.

12:03.891 --> 12:07.060
Goodwin said you did
a good job on his car.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.041
I forgive you.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.581
Hey, honey.
<i>Kaale,</i> Mom.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.383
Uh-uh, you are home late.

12:30.483 --> 12:32.685
Bob will tell you why.
I have homework.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.687
Wow.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.626
What's going on?

12:40.627 --> 12:42.095
I'll tell you what's going on.

12:42.195 --> 12:45.465
That ex-husband of yours
is some piece of work.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.034
What are you talking about?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.668
Get this,
he went behind our backs

12:48.768 --> 12:50.103
and taught Dele to drive.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.572
How dare he undermine me
like that?

12:52.672 --> 12:54.241
Right?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.776
I think you should call him and
give him a piece of your mind.

12:59.913 --> 13:00.848
Bob?

13:00.948 --> 13:02.049
Yeah?

13:02.149 --> 13:04.017
Why did he tell you?

13:04.117 --> 13:06.219
Huh?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.989
Why did Dele tell you
he knew how to drive?

13:09.089 --> 13:12.025
It came up in conversation.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.560
What conversation?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.263
The conversation I had with him

13:16.363 --> 13:18.465
when I offered
to teach him to drive.

13:19.833 --> 13:23.436
I specifically told you
I did not want him driving.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.605
I made a call. Look, I know
you're trying to protect Dele,

13:25.705 --> 13:27.574
but he's growing up
whether you like it or not.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.810
Well, thank you
for educating me about my son.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.080
Aw, come on, don't...

13:34.581 --> 13:36.383
Get.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.090
Knock, knock.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.657
<i>Kaasan,</i> Auntie.

13:44.757 --> 13:47.494
Just coming to have lunch
with my blue-collar husband.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.129
Uncle's sealing up some windows.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.531
Walk till you hear the sounds
of Earth, Wind, and Tunde.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.102
He's like a new man.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.670
He has lost eight pounds
since he started helping you.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.173
That's great. I don't know
what I'd do without him.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.142
He comes home each day
with the appetite

14:02.242 --> 14:03.843
of someone 20 years younger.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.246
You're not talking
about food, are you?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.281
No.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.551
I got to take this.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.986
Oh, of course.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.854
Bob Wheeler.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.524
Bob.
I'm sorry, who's this?

14:17.624 --> 14:18.691
Tayo.

14:18.791 --> 14:19.960
I just spoke to Abishola.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.229
It seems we are
in the doghouse together.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.899
Glad this is fun for you.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.500
Ah, she's overreacting.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.537
I taught Dele to drive the same
way my father taught me.

14:30.637 --> 14:31.972
Oh, what kind of car
did you learn in?

14:32.072 --> 14:34.174
A ruby red Nissan Terrano II.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.242
Sounds cool.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.676
It was not.

14:36.776 --> 14:39.512
'67 Impala for me.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.781
Ah, that was my dream car.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.584
Ah, your dream car
got six gallons to the mile.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.153
You mean miles to the gallon?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.922
No, I said it right.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.724
You should have seen Dele
on his first drive.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.193
I said, "Only do

14:53.293 --> 14:54.794
what makes you
feel comfortable,"

14:54.894 --> 14:58.231
and, boom, he got right on
the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.299
The what?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.201
It's the Route 66 of Nigeria.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.735
Well, from now on,

15:02.835 --> 15:05.905
I'll think of it as
the Lagos-Ibadan of America.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.775
Ah... It's nice to know

15:08.875 --> 15:10.743
that there's someone rational
in my son's life.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.580
Hey, Abishola's raising
that kid on her own

15:13.680 --> 15:16.316
in a country that brings danger
for him at every turn.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.618
God bless her
for being overprotective.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.053
I'm sorry,

15:20.153 --> 15:22.622
did I call Bob or my ex-wife?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.657
I'm hanging up. Okay.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.626
I was just saying
I'm happy there's

15:26.726 --> 15:29.162
a like-minded parent
for Dele in America.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.630
Oh, we're not like-minded.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.299
We just agree
on this one thing.

15:32.399 --> 15:35.235
Oh, so you don't think
it would be good

15:35.335 --> 15:37.404
for Dele to get a summer job?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.207
Okay, we agree about two things.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.909
Ah. It will teach him responsibility,

15:43.010 --> 15:44.377
keep him out of trouble.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.146
Put some money in his pocket.

15:46.246 --> 15:48.215
Hmm. You know, Abishola thinks

15:48.315 --> 15:50.417
he should focus on his studies,

15:50.517 --> 15:53.253
but if both of us push for it...

15:53.353 --> 15:55.755
I'm hanging up.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.628
You wanted to see me?

16:01.728 --> 16:04.331
Ah, yes. Please, have a seat.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.301
At the end of every
successful week,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.137
I like to treat myself

16:10.237 --> 16:12.005
to a finger
of single malt scotch.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.406
Sounds nice.
It is.

16:13.506 --> 16:16.976
Guess who else
has earned a finger.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.612
All right,
finger me, bro.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.483
Cheers.
Cheers.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.752
Hey, Goodwin, do you have a sec?

16:25.852 --> 16:27.587
I do not.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.523
I've noticed
that sales from our

16:30.623 --> 16:32.159
men's line have dropped,
and I think

16:32.259 --> 16:33.693
it might be a design issue.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.928
Okay. Goodbye.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.997
Well, when it comes to
therapeutic hosiery,

16:38.098 --> 16:41.034
men prefer a more discreet look
over loud patterns.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.302
Research shows that

16:42.402 --> 16:43.570
they don't like
drawing attention

16:43.670 --> 16:45.038
to their health needs.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.206
Interesting.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.374
I thought so.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.242
Well done.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.378
In the future,
if you have other ideas,

16:51.478 --> 16:54.347
you may tell Douglas,
and he will pass them along.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.016
Of course.

16:57.117 --> 16:59.386
Hang on, Christina.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.489
You should know,
if it wasn't for her,

17:02.589 --> 17:03.990
I wouldn't have had

17:04.091 --> 17:06.025
any idea what to do about
the whole messed-up order.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.327
Is that so?

17:07.427 --> 17:08.628
It is.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.798
I would've genuinely been
lost without her.

17:11.898 --> 17:15.068
Christina, sit down.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.936
Join us for a finger.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.339
I'm sorry?

17:19.439 --> 17:21.608
It'll make sense
in a second.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.180
Let's see,
how about fishing?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.116
Anybody ever teach you
how to fish?

17:29.216 --> 17:30.683
Uncle Tunde.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.452
Hmm...

17:32.552 --> 17:34.387
You ever
play poker?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.556
Well, how do you think
I got these shoes?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.758
Dele?
Yes, Mum?

17:38.858 --> 17:39.826
Come with me.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.361
Am I in trouble?

17:41.461 --> 17:42.962
You will see.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.098
Seems like yes.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.566
Good luck, buddy.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.273
Ta-da!

17:53.373 --> 17:55.975
Are you serious?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.310
You let Bob buy me a car?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.945
I bought it.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.748
It has the highest
possible safety ratings,

18:01.848 --> 18:03.183
and because
it is yellow,

18:03.283 --> 18:06.253
people will see you
and not crash into you.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.655
It's definitely yellow.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.423
Thank you, Mum.
I love it.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.693
I have conditions.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.663
You will always have somebody
in the car with you.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.731
Yes, Mum.
And you will

18:18.831 --> 18:22.001
have to get 100% in all
of your classes first.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.803
Yes, Mum.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.773
And you will not even touch it
without a proper permit.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.542
So... why do I
have it now?

18:29.642 --> 18:33.045
Because if you must grow up,
you will do it my way.

18:34.080 --> 18:37.150
Whose car is that?
Mine.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.719
Somehow I ended up
with a car.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.322
Can I sit in it?
Go ahead.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.123
Keys?
Not a chance.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.030
You continually
amaze me.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.133
I amaze myself.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.412
♪ No matter what anybody says,
I already know ♪

19:05.512 --> 19:07.113
♪ It's gonna be all right ♪

19:07.214 --> 19:09.182
♪ A sign is a route in the midst
of adversity... ♪

19:09.282 --> 19:12.084
Ten and two, Dele.
Ten and two!

19:12.185 --> 19:14.521
Of course,
Grandma Dottie. Sorry.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.357
Watch the road, boy.
Are you trying to kill us?

19:17.457 --> 19:18.858
No, Granny Ebun.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.260
And turn down that music.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.729
I can barely hear myself
shout at you.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.564
Yes, Granny Ebun.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.199
What should we do next?

19:26.299 --> 19:29.236
I'd be happy
to take you two back home.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.703
You want to hit up
a happy hour?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.171
Dele can stay
in the car.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.106
I did it all the
time with Bobby.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.309
I suppose I could go
for a Mai Tai.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.879
Attagirl! Dele, take us
to the Red Onion on 14th.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.381
Step on it.
