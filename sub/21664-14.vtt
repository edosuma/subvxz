- To my knowledge,
Bob the Robot

08:34.133 --> 08:36.000
did not have
the power of flight.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.400
In fact, if he did,

08:37.567 --> 08:39.200
he would most likely be called
Bob the Drone Aircraft,

08:39.299 --> 08:40.366
not Bob the Robot.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.433
- Stop trying to
muddy the waters.

08:42.567 --> 08:45.800
You must admit the evidence
against you is compelling.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.100
- [knock at door]
- Not now.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.133
- Excuse me, Ms. Hough,
but I have some information.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.067
- Miss Reyes, go on.

08:51.167 --> 08:54.100
- Frankie is innocent.
She's being framed.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.567
She would never harm
anyone or their stuff.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.000
- People are not
always whom

08:58.100 --> 08:59.833
they appear to be,
Miss Reyes.

08:59.933 --> 09:01.467
Like myself.

09:01.567 --> 09:05.067
I may seem like a merry lass
who loves to have a good time...

09:05.167 --> 09:06.333
[laughing]

09:06.433 --> 09:08.267
But I can be quite serious,
I assure you.

09:08.367 --> 09:09.733
- I know Frankie.

09:09.833 --> 09:12.167
I know her better than
anyone else at this school.

09:12.267 --> 09:14.200
- This is true, Ms. Hough.
We are besties.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.333
- And as her bestie,

09:16.433 --> 09:19.033
I know that if she says
she didn't do it,

09:19.133 --> 09:20.333
she didn't do it.

09:20.433 --> 09:21.633
- I'm sorry to say,

09:21.733 --> 09:23.567
the evidence tells
another story.

09:23.667 --> 09:26.433
I have no choice but to follow
the disciplinary code.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.267
Frankie Gaines, you are hereby
suspended immediately.

09:33.743 --> 09:35.743
- This is so unfair.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.276
I wish we had more time
to figure this out.

09:39.776 --> 09:42.543
Frankie, can you access
your house's phone network?

09:42.643 --> 09:43.876
- Of course.

09:43.976 --> 09:45.609
I have unlimited access to
our Cloud server, phone,

09:45.743 --> 09:47.243
and all electronic
appliances.

09:47.343 --> 09:48.643
Dad frequently
leaves the oven on,

09:48.743 --> 09:50.409
and I am able to
shut it off remotely.

09:50.509 --> 09:51.609
- Perfect!

09:51.709 --> 09:53.376
Then you can
intercept the call

09:53.476 --> 09:54.943
before it gets
through to your mom.

09:55.043 --> 09:56.909
- That is not appropriate.
I'm not...

09:57.009 --> 09:58.843

out you were suspended

09:58.943 --> 10:00.243

you didn't do?

10:00.343 --> 10:03.909
Now, hurry, Ms. Hough could
make that call any second.

10:04.009 --> 10:06.743

10:13.443 --> 10:14.876

don't play it for your mom

what happened.

10:38.609 --> 10:40.576

10:45.276 --> 10:46.943
Who'd wanna do that?

10:47.043 --> 10:49.276
- You are not afraid
of me, right?

10:49.376 --> 10:50.943
- Of course not.

10:51.043 --> 10:53.809
But if your mom starts
to think that people are,

10:53.909 --> 10:55.643
and that you might
hurt someone,

10:55.743 --> 10:57.309
oh, I don't even
wanna say it.

10:57.409 --> 10:58.743
- I will. My mom
will have no choice

10:58.809 --> 11:01.443
but to shut me down,
permanently.

11:01.543 --> 11:02.976

gonna happen.

11:03.076 --> 11:03.876
I won't let it.

You don't normally
do selfless acts.

12:14.743 --> 12:17.643
- Yeah, you're
big-time selfish.

12:17.743 --> 12:19.809
No offense.
- None taken, Makayla.

somebody to take the fall.

12:29.576 --> 12:32.043
Then Ms. Hough will have to
lift Frankie's suspension.

12:32.143 --> 12:34.243
- That's pretty
malevolent, Tammy.

12:34.343 --> 12:35.509
- Thank you.

12:35.609 --> 12:36.776

12:46.743 --> 12:47.809

but Frankie is behaving more
like a human teen every day.

14:17.876 --> 14:19.043

- Rude?

14:25.576 --> 14:29.043
Sigourney, I know you have
