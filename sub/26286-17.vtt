00:02.289 --> 00:03.903
When I thought you weren't coming, I...

00:03.928 --> 00:05.547
I left you a voice mail.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.039
You mean the one where you belittled me

00:07.064 --> 00:08.560
and told me to grow the hell up?

00:08.585 --> 00:09.775
You know what, Randall, you still have

00:09.800 --> 00:10.976
that cot at your office?

00:11.001 --> 00:12.359
You should go sleep on it.

00:13.343 --> 00:15.080
I'm not sleeping in Philadelphia, Beth.

00:15.181 --> 00:17.283
We can't keep simmering
like this forever.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.015
Fine. You want to do this right now?

00:19.109 --> 00:21.110
Let's do this. Close the door.

00:26.679 --> 00:29.421
- Beth, if you think you...
- No. Mm-mm. Me first.

00:31.181 --> 00:32.981
I am looking at you right now,

00:33.006 --> 00:34.643
but I don't even recognize you.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.102
Because my husband,
the man that I married,

00:37.203 --> 00:38.820
would never talk to me the way

00:38.845 --> 00:40.953
that you did on that voice mail, ever.

00:40.978 --> 00:42.109
I know.

00:42.713 --> 00:44.023
And I'm sorry.

00:44.195 --> 00:45.882
That message was a gross misstep.

00:45.907 --> 00:48.056
A misstep? Randall,
your Coogi sweater phase

00:48.081 --> 00:49.148
in college, that's a misstep.

00:49.173 --> 00:50.312
Okay? What you said...

00:50.337 --> 00:51.492
What-what were your exact words?

00:51.517 --> 00:54.320
That I teach
"bored housewives how to twirl"?

00:54.345 --> 00:55.445
I didn't mean it.

00:55.470 --> 00:56.632
I was just...

00:57.796 --> 00:59.523
I was trying to hurt your feelings.

00:59.548 --> 01:01.039
I thought you were
standing me up, and I...

01:01.064 --> 01:02.598
Why would I stand you up?

01:02.837 --> 01:05.138
When have I ever not had your back?

01:07.481 --> 01:08.750
Never.

01:10.992 --> 01:12.835
But if we're being honest, Beth,

01:12.860 --> 01:15.843
our rhythm has been off.

01:16.187 --> 01:17.515
All right? It's been off for months.

01:17.540 --> 01:20.304
No, no. My rhythm is fine;
your rhythm is off.

01:20.804 --> 01:22.839
And it's off because you're not
getting what you want.

01:22.864 --> 01:24.965
- I'm not getting what I want?
- No. Because I refuse

01:24.990 --> 01:27.023
to give up my own life
to accommodate yours.

01:27.048 --> 01:28.726
I've never asked... Oh, my...

01:32.094 --> 01:33.718
I am killing myself

01:33.743 --> 01:36.406
driving to Philly and back every day.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.187
If I'm lucky, I get a chance

01:38.212 --> 01:39.859
to catch the girls
before they go to bed.

01:40.196 --> 01:44.421
If not, then I'm stuck sleeping
on a pull-out in my office.

01:44.929 --> 01:47.976
I'm not even sworn in yet, Beth,
and I am already swamped.

01:48.001 --> 01:51.132
But I still make it back
for your dance recital.

01:51.325 --> 01:53.273
And I still make it home
to watch the girls

01:53.298 --> 01:54.921
every time you have an evening class,

01:54.946 --> 01:57.562
because I want you
to have your own life.

01:57.587 --> 01:58.898
No, you don't.

01:59.076 --> 02:00.992
You just realized
I'm not gonna stop teaching,

02:01.017 --> 02:02.851
but you are definitely not on board.

02:03.189 --> 02:06.750
No, no. For the past 20 years,
I have stood by your side

02:06.775 --> 02:09.639
through every whim, every pipe dream,

02:09.664 --> 02:11.992
every flight of fancy
that you can think of.

02:12.017 --> 02:14.385
And for the first time, the first time,

02:14.864 --> 02:16.390
I have a flight of fancy.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.129
Something that I want.

02:18.262 --> 02:20.750
And still, it becomes about you.

02:21.810 --> 02:26.000

having the same fight since we met.

"Hey, Beth, I'm Randall...

- You might.

04:31.811 --> 04:33.890

04:33.915 --> 04:35.315

04:35.340 --> 04:37.445
Tell her you're taking her
to dinner tomorrow night,

04:37.470 --> 04:39.015
and you want to know what time
to pick her up.

04:40.461 --> 04:41.867

04:42.946 --> 04:45.132
I'm gonna take you out
to dinner tomorrow night.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.671
What time should I come pick you up?

04:50.493 --> 04:53.679
U-Um, Randall, are you...
are you asking me out?

Yes.

05:38.161 --> 05:39.687

05:40.291 --> 05:42.281
You probably get asked out
on dates all the time.

05:43.936 --> 05:45.257
Not really.

05:51.161 --> 05:52.664
You're an architecture major.

05:53.145 --> 05:54.960
I thought you might want to study dance.

05:56.069 --> 05:58.271
No. What made you think that?

05:58.740 --> 06:00.101
I asked around about you.

06:02.138 --> 06:04.554
Well, you got some bad Intel.

06:05.398 --> 06:07.800
I used to dance, but not anymore.

06:08.136 --> 06:09.812
RANDALL: Hmm. Ever?

06:10.671 --> 06:13.781
Like, if someone put on some
<i>Miseducation of Lauryn Hill right now,</i>

06:13.896 --> 06:15.196
you wouldn't cut a rug?

06:16.563 --> 06:19.296
(LAUGHS) Okay. Um, well, first of all,

06:19.664 --> 06:22.992
you don't dance to Lauryn Hill;
you groove.

06:23.087 --> 06:25.898
And secondly, who says "cut a rug"?

06:25.923 --> 06:27.437
A lot of people say "cut a rug."

06:27.765 --> 06:28.914
White people.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.453
Well, I was raised by white people.

06:32.881 --> 06:34.085
I'm adopted.

06:35.492 --> 06:36.859
You'd be surprised how hard that is

06:36.884 --> 06:38.351
to ease in the conversation.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.601
Mm. Yeah, I didn't know.

06:43.142 --> 06:44.960
Well, maybe you should
have asked around about me.

06:50.929 --> 06:54.171
I was dropped off at a
fire station the day I was born.

06:54.689 --> 06:57.234
And a fireman brought me to a hospital,

06:57.648 --> 06:59.601
and my dad convinced my mom to adopt me.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.875
He died earlier this year.

07:07.924 --> 07:09.164
(CHUCKLING): My dad.

07:11.024 --> 07:12.492
It was a heart attack, and...

07:19.050 --> 07:20.250
I'm sorry, Beth.

07:20.534 --> 07:21.710
Uh...

07:22.898 --> 07:24.171
I'm not used to saying that...

07:25.255 --> 07:26.687
out loud yet. I'm sorry.

07:29.864 --> 07:31.070
Um...

07:31.676 --> 07:34.726
Uh, my dad passed away last year.

07:35.906 --> 07:37.593
He was sick for a while,

07:37.618 --> 07:40.781
but it still felt so sudden.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.367
Yeah.

07:48.966 --> 07:50.398
I think we're ready to order.

07:51.171 --> 07:52.627
Sorry, but my manager asked

07:52.652 --> 07:54.609
if you could pay for your meal first.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.395
Um, is there something wrong?

08:00.812 --> 08:02.804
WAITER: No, it's a restaurant policy.

08:04.343 --> 08:06.921
Well, did-did all these people
pay for their meal in advance,

08:06.946 --> 08:09.210
or is that policy just for us?

08:09.235 --> 08:10.812
Beth, it's fine.

08:11.143 --> 08:12.781
You know, we probably just, you know,

08:12.806 --> 08:14.984
look a little young to be here, I guess.

08:15.009 --> 08:17.543
So I'll pay. The money's right here.

08:18.109 --> 08:20.546

08:20.571 --> 08:22.195
- check is gonna be, but...
- Okay, okay. No, um...

08:22.220 --> 08:23.289

08:35.500 --> 08:37.210
You were actually gonna
hand over your check

08:37.235 --> 08:39.460
- like that was okay.
- Of course it isn't okay,

08:39.485 --> 08:41.625
but I-I didn't want to ruin the date.

08:42.710 --> 08:45.054
Okay, okay, look, Randall,
you're a very nice guy,

08:45.079 --> 08:47.242

trying to set me up with you

the only two black kids there,

08:49.157 --> 08:51.109

(SIGHS) Y-You're-You're a lot.

08:53.368 --> 08:56.270
And this date was a lot.

08:56.574 --> 08:57.812
What do you mean?

08:59.885 --> 09:04.367
Um, you want to know what
my idea of the perfect date is?

09:04.980 --> 09:06.179
It's nachos.

09:06.204 --> 09:08.062
It's-it's ginger beer and nachos.

09:08.233 --> 09:09.640
This? All this,

09:09.665 --> 09:11.929
this-this restaurant
and-and the flowers,

09:11.954 --> 09:14.523
and... I mean, you're in a suit and tie.

09:14.548 --> 09:17.304
It is 78 degrees right now.
Aren't you hot?

09:17.329 --> 09:18.890
I mean, it's a little hot, yeah, but...

09:18.915 --> 09:20.515
Then take off the stupid jacket.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.796
It's not a stupid jacket.

09:23.846 --> 09:25.148
You're trying to start a fight with me,

09:25.173 --> 09:26.640
but I don't want to fight with you.

09:27.252 --> 09:29.109
I-I grew up in a house
with parents who didn't fight.

09:29.134 --> 09:30.804
I... I mean,

09:31.461 --> 09:33.171
Th-they-they fought once.

09:33.196 --> 09:34.764
It-it was actually pretty rough.

09:34.789 --> 09:36.781
I came home early
and watched the entire thing...

09:36.806 --> 09:38.330
Okay, Randall, I've known you
for ten minutes.

09:38.355 --> 09:40.070
Just... stop telling me this stuff.

09:40.095 --> 09:41.696
- It's-it's too much.
- Beth.

09:42.104 --> 09:44.765
B-Beth. Stop it.

09:45.440 --> 09:47.210
You can't just walk off like that.

09:48.298 --> 09:50.523
This jacket i-is the nicest thing I own,

09:50.548 --> 09:52.812
and I-I wore it because I wanted
to look nice for you.

09:52.877 --> 09:54.835
These flowers?
I didn't know what you'd like,

09:54.860 --> 09:56.296
so I bought four bouquets.

09:56.619 --> 09:58.875
My dorm is literally covered
in flowers. I...

10:00.579 --> 10:03.062

Again, you're-you're a very nice guy,

21:14.437 --> 21:16.905
I think I wrote a deeply boring
dissertation on marriage.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.040
Will you... will you
go tell Beth I need more time?

21:20.260 --> 21:22.267
Okay. Okay.

21:26.022 --> 21:28.493
Okay. Bride is ready.

21:28.518 --> 21:30.642
BAD NEWS: the groom is not.
He's rewriting his vows.

21:31.330 --> 21:32.430
- What?
- Yeah.

21:32.455 --> 21:33.657
He's rewriting his vows?

21:33.682 --> 21:34.923
Wow. So pretty.

21:34.948 --> 21:36.204
Are you freaking kidding me?

21:37.320 --> 21:40.165
Beth, I don't think
we need to overreact.

- Sort of...
- Oh, you're very funny.

21:54.114 --> 21:57.056
What are you doing in here?
It's bad luck to see each other

21:57.081 --> 21:58.993
- before the wedding.
- Well, that's why I'm not looking.

21:59.096 --> 22:01.056
How the hell are you
still writing your vows?

22:01.081 --> 22:03.712
No, I'm not writing them.
I'm-I'm revising them.

22:03.737 --> 22:05.163
Okay? And you're one to talk.

22:05.188 --> 22:06.751
Kevin said you
were still working on yours.

22:06.776 --> 22:08.735
Well, the reason mine
aren't written is because I've

22:08.760 --> 22:11.103
been working on getting
this wedding ready all week.

22:11.527 --> 22:14.126
Which I did on my own, mind you,
because you were too busy

22:14.151 --> 22:16.017
writing the wedding vows of the century.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.392
I was just trying to make them perfect.

22:20.419 --> 22:22.953
Wait. You really feel
like you planned this wedding

22:22.978 --> 22:24.251
all by yourself?

22:28.601 --> 22:30.806
No, I'm just stressed.

22:34.025 --> 22:35.282
Um...

22:36.726 --> 22:38.946
what do you want to do about the vows?

22:40.998 --> 22:42.432
Let's just write them together.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.579
You know? Right now.

22:44.708 --> 22:46.384
You want to co-write the wedding vows?

22:46.409 --> 22:48.329
Yeah. Randall, we're better together.

22:48.354 --> 22:50.360
That's why we're doing this whole thing.

22:50.854 --> 22:54.595
Come on. Right now, let's just take
turns and speak from the heart.

Just...

23:02.705 --> 23:03.782
Okay.

(EXHALES)

Beth...

23:16.673 --> 23:19.150
I'm sorry I spent too much time
working on my vows.

23:20.152 --> 23:23.228
As you well know,
sometimes I overthink things.

23:23.253 --> 23:24.501
Overthink everything.

23:24.684 --> 23:25.829
All right, you're right.

23:25.854 --> 23:28.376
As you know, sometimes
I overthink everything.

23:30.965 --> 23:32.189

23:33.255 --> 23:36.321

23:36.479 --> 23:38.454
- What about Janet?
- Right again.

23:38.479 --> 23:39.912
Except for that very small part of me

23:39.937 --> 23:41.985
that I promised to Janet Jackson
when I was 16.

23:44.778 --> 23:47.751
Your heart is unlike
anything I've ever known.

23:48.550 --> 23:50.439
You're my steady place, Beth.

23:51.818 --> 23:54.962
I'm the best version of me
when I'm with you.

23:55.322 --> 23:58.087
And that's not just because
you stepped my fashion game up.

23:58.112 --> 23:59.767
Which I did, for the record.

23:59.792 --> 24:02.064
Well, let the record reflect
your contribution.

24:04.703 --> 24:05.868
Beth...

24:06.890 --> 24:09.079
I want to be the man that you deserve.

24:11.041 --> 24:12.259
And...

24:12.832 --> 24:15.485
I promise to spend the rest
of my life earning your love,

And no matter what may come our way...

25:13.347 --> 25:15.946
I promise that I'll always choose you.

25:17.789 --> 25:18.985
I love you.

25:19.691 --> 25:20.939

- You're using the wrong wipes.
- Then why are they here?

- BETH: She likes the smell.
- What, you buy the wrong wipes

26:20.744 --> 26:22.044
just so that she can smell them?

I don't know, honestly.
Move. I'll do it.

Uh-uh. You asked me to do it.

27:44.307 --> 27:45.634
That she can't dance.

27:46.775 --> 27:48.230
That she don't have no rhythm.

27:49.306 --> 27:50.398
Don't look at me like that.

- That's a real fear.
- (LAUGHS): Okay.

27:53.003 --> 27:55.321
- Your turn.
- Mm...

27:56.470 --> 27:58.525
That she's covered in tattoos.

27:59.181 --> 28:00.329
You know, call me old-fashioned,

28:00.354 --> 28:02.962
but I don't want T-Pain
making a song about my daughter.

28:03.689 --> 28:06.148
That she forgets me
when my maternity leave ends

28:06.173 --> 28:07.540
and I go back to work.

28:08.157 --> 28:09.931
That is worst-case for me.

28:11.595 --> 28:14.490
That these past three months
with her just weren't enough.

28:15.306 --> 28:17.626
I thought you were looking
forward to going back to work.

28:17.727 --> 28:20.548

28:22.312 --> 28:23.564
Hey.

28:24.884 --> 28:26.650
Beth, we'll figure out
a way to make it work.

28:27.376 --> 28:29.423
Yeah, sounds good, but, you know,

28:29.970 --> 28:33.282
"making it work" usually means
I adjust, I make it work.

28:33.381 --> 28:35.407
- What does that mean?
- (CHUCKLES) Nothing.

28:35.510 --> 28:36.915
No! You can't "nothing" that.

28:37.540 --> 28:39.281
- Say it.
- Oh, come on, Randall,

28:39.306 --> 28:41.376
let's be real...
you're not gonna quit your job,

28:41.647 --> 28:45.282
so if somebody has to
make it work, it's gonna be me.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.319
I have to lose something.

28:47.344 --> 28:48.595
That's not true.

28:57.082 --> 29:00.485
You know what?
I have this theory. Hear me out.

29:00.510 --> 29:02.077
- Okay.
- So,

29:02.372 --> 29:06.118
there are three different kinds
of nachos, right?

29:06.143 --> 29:08.044
- Uh-huh.
- There are the crumbs,

29:08.462 --> 29:11.017
the little scraps with
all the salt at the bottom.

29:11.206 --> 29:14.914
They stick to your fingers. They
mess up your clothes. They're nasty.

29:14.939 --> 29:16.716
- Nobody likes them, right?
- Okay.

29:16.741 --> 29:19.876
Then there are the chipped nachos, okay?

29:20.408 --> 29:22.076
There's no smooth edges.

29:22.610 --> 29:23.931
Sometimes they catch cheese.

29:23.956 --> 29:25.892
Sometimes they're just
a plain chip. They're fine.

29:26.517 --> 29:28.454
And then there's the cream of the crop.

29:29.275 --> 29:32.282
The whole nacho with lots of cheese

29:32.307 --> 29:34.329
and the perfect amount of toppings.

29:34.371 --> 29:37.673
Unbroken, fully coated

29:37.698 --> 29:39.798
- triangles of goodness.
- (LAUGHS): Wait.

29:40.134 --> 29:41.478
It's 4:00 in the morning,

29:41.503 --> 29:43.137
and you're giving me
a dissertation on nachos?

29:43.162 --> 29:44.556
No, you know I be philosophizing.

29:44.581 --> 29:45.923
- (CHUCKLES): Yeah, well...
- Now,

29:46.925 --> 29:50.196
I was thinking, you know
what's great about us, Randall,

29:50.221 --> 29:53.845
is that when I need nachos,
you make them for me.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.683
And I love that.

29:55.861 --> 30:00.650
But you're the kind of person
who goes for the whole chip

30:01.180 --> 30:02.876
with lots of cheese.

30:03.431 --> 30:04.571
You don't do it on purpose.

30:04.596 --> 30:07.392
You're just a whole chip with
a lot of cheese kind of person.

30:08.077 --> 30:11.978
And so am I, yet...

30:14.790 --> 30:17.384
Wait, no. I don't leave you
with the crumbs.

30:17.409 --> 30:18.415
(CHUCKLES)

30:18.440 --> 30:20.025
What, do you feel like I
leave you with the crumbs?

30:20.050 --> 30:21.350
No, don't spiral.
I don't... I don't even know

30:21.375 --> 30:22.951
what I'm saying, okay? I'm exhausted.

30:23.053 --> 30:25.321
Yeah, well, I'll never eat
nachos again, so there you go.

30:25.422 --> 30:26.782
No. Oh, come on. All right, come on.

30:26.807 --> 30:28.431
Let's just go to bed, all right?

30:28.670 --> 30:30.946
Before our little screamer
wakes us up again.

30:32.214 --> 30:34.454
We'll just clean that up in the morning.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.710
So I told this cat,
"I'm never playing dominoes

30:44.735 --> 30:46.134
- in this joint again."
- (LAUGHTER)

30:48.040 --> 30:50.306

- Hey, guys.

30:50.331 --> 30:51.400
Hey, you hungry?

30:51.425 --> 30:53.603
- Kev made pancakes.
- I see that.

30:53.704 --> 30:55.454
KEVIN: Yeah, Beth, I was
talking to Randall earlier,

30:55.479 --> 30:58.156
and the Wi-Fi in the
basement, it's subpar.

30:58.197 --> 30:59.759
- It's very spotty.
- Uh, 'cause it's a basement.

30:59.784 --> 31:01.937
Well, why am I in the basement?
'Cause, you know,

31:01.962 --> 31:03.728
William over here, he's
upstairs, he's in Annie's room.

31:10.380 --> 31:13.181
- Mm. All right.
- All right, well, I'm headed out.

- So, uh,

31:19.948 --> 31:22.216
Cindy's parents can't drop off Annie,

31:22.241 --> 31:23.712
so can you pick her up
from her sleepover?

31:23.737 --> 31:25.634
Yes, ma'am.
Will Hill and I are on the job.

31:25.918 --> 31:27.610
- All right, love you.
- Love you, too.

31:27.876 --> 31:29.556
- Mm. Bye.
- Bye, guys.

31:29.851 --> 31:30.915
KEVIN: You know what we should do?

31:30.940 --> 31:33.595
- RANDALL: What do you want to do?
- Right now? Dominoes, for money.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.343
Oh, no, no. I'm not... I'm not
gonna take your guys' money.

31:35.368 --> 31:36.478
(OVERLAPPING ARGUING)

31:36.555 --> 31:38.196
KEVIN: You're scared.
You look scared to me.

31:38.221 --> 31:39.548
- WILLIAM: Oh, boy.
- I'll take your money.

31:39.573 --> 31:40.587
RANDALL: Go get him.

31:41.838 --> 31:43.782
How far away does Annie's friend live?

31:43.886 --> 31:45.228
- We're almost there.
- Hmm.

31:45.253 --> 31:46.298
(PHONE CHIMES)

31:47.537 --> 31:48.829
RANDALL: Oh, you know how to text?

31:50.585 --> 31:52.728
- I'm dying. I'm not a hundred.
- (CHUCKLES)

31:53.735 --> 31:55.064
Jesse's trying to get me to go

31:55.089 --> 31:56.931
to this Charles Lloyd concert tonight,

31:56.956 --> 31:58.756
but the show doesn't start till 9:00.

31:59.415 --> 32:01.110
Well, I know we run
a tight ship, William,

32:01.135 --> 32:02.845
but it's okay for you
to stay out past curfew.

32:02.870 --> 32:05.493
Well, thank you, but these things
end late, and I don't want

32:05.518 --> 32:07.454
to have to spend the night at his place.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.837
The man's apartment is freezing.

32:11.575 --> 32:12.860
Why don't you just ask him,

32:12.885 --> 32:14.939
"Hey, Jesse, mind if we
turn on the heat?"

32:14.964 --> 32:18.025
Nah, I don't want him to have to
change his routine on account of me.

32:18.050 --> 32:20.853
It's easier if I just make
an excuse not to stay over.

32:20.986 --> 32:23.220
No, man, it's easier to talk to him.

32:23.383 --> 32:25.853
You know, me and Beth,
we don't sit on stuff.

32:25.878 --> 32:27.110
We talk to each other.

32:27.282 --> 32:29.450
Nothing beats honest,
open communication.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.816
Okay, Uncle Phil. I'll think on it.

32:32.026 --> 32:33.923
Oh, we making <i>Fresh Prince</i>
<i>references now, huh?</i>

32:33.948 --> 32:36.282
- How old do you actually think I am?
- (BOTH LAUGH)

32:37.202 --> 32:38.321
Hey, pull over.

32:38.726 --> 32:41.394
I want to get some more syrup
for them leftover pancakes.

32:41.419 --> 32:42.540
Might have it for dinner.

32:42.565 --> 32:43.696
Right on.

32:45.501 --> 32:46.814
Maybe down here, son.

32:46.839 --> 32:47.923
Yeah.

32:52.390 --> 32:53.509
Beth?

32:57.271 --> 32:58.665
Why aren't you in Hershey?

33:00.923 --> 33:02.110
I, uh...

33:03.985 --> 33:05.939
I'm gonna go find that syrup.

33:06.483 --> 33:08.915
Give you a chance to do some
of that great communicating

33:08.940 --> 33:10.251
you're so proud of.

33:13.194 --> 33:15.376
- What are you doing here?
- Buying syrup.

33:16.330 --> 33:17.501
What are you doing here?

33:18.539 --> 33:19.840
Don't jump to conclusions.

33:19.865 --> 33:21.306
- It's not what you think.
- Swedish Fish.

33:21.331 --> 33:23.509
What, you stopping at the movies
on your way to Hershey?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.790
That doesn't explain
that bottle of wine.

33:25.815 --> 33:28.509
- Randall, I...
- Or did you make up a conference

33:28.534 --> 33:30.587
so you could secretly
check into a hotel for the night

33:30.612 --> 33:32.126
to watch movies
and drink that bottle of wine

33:32.151 --> 33:34.634
- and eat Swedish Fish?
- Damn, that's impressive.

33:34.659 --> 33:35.915
What the hell, Beth?

33:35.940 --> 33:38.900
I just needed 24 hours to myself.

33:40.557 --> 33:43.275
Away from biological fathers
and white brothers.

33:43.367 --> 33:45.579
And don't get me wrong, I adore them.

33:45.774 --> 33:47.275
I adore William.

33:47.736 --> 33:48.876
I tolerate Kevin.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.587
But it's a lot.

33:51.770 --> 33:52.900
So I lied.

33:53.348 --> 33:56.767
I just needed 24 hours.

33:57.042 --> 33:59.032
Not to be a wife and a mother

33:59.057 --> 34:01.196
and a caretaker and a housekeeper.

34:01.221 --> 34:03.735
I just... I just want to be a woman

34:03.760 --> 34:06.556
who sleeps in a big-ass
hotel bed and watches movies

34:06.581 --> 34:09.985
and-and reruns of <i>Living Single</i>
<i>from my iPad</i>

34:10.429 --> 34:12.532
in my big-ass Jacuzzi tub, and I...

34:12.556 --> 34:14.610
Okay, I get it.

34:15.492 --> 34:18.087
- There's a lot going on in our house.
- Yes.

34:18.775 --> 34:20.907
But if you needed space,
why not just ask for it...

34:20.931 --> 34:22.126
I have asked!

34:23.690 --> 34:24.969
I have asked.

34:25.335 --> 34:28.275
And the last time I asked,
it became a one-act play

34:28.300 --> 34:29.603
about "what's wrong"

34:29.628 --> 34:31.775
and-and "why do I need a day alone?"

34:32.273 --> 34:34.150
By the time I convinced you
it was nothing bigger,

34:34.175 --> 34:37.377
the day was over,
and it was... I was exhausted.

34:37.590 --> 34:40.141
I wouldn't have been awake to
watch a single <i>Living Single.</i>

34:44.630 --> 34:47.047
I-I'm sorry. I love you.

34:47.072 --> 34:49.532
- I feel terrible that I lied.
- I don't want you to feel

34:49.556 --> 34:50.829
like you have to run away from us.

34:50.853 --> 34:54.790
I don't. I swear. There's just
a lot of men living in my house.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.297
And I broke.

34:58.261 --> 34:59.602
(BETH CRYING)

35:05.871 --> 35:07.001
Okay.

35:07.417 --> 35:11.095
- All right, go enjoy your 24 hours.
- (LAUGHS)

35:15.670 --> 35:18.212
Uh, will you just answer me one thing?

35:20.004 --> 35:22.032
What episode of <i>Living Single</i>
<i>are you gonna start with?</i>

35:23.789 --> 35:25.823
The one where Max and Kyle
sleep together

35:25.848 --> 35:28.384
and wake up in the La-Z-Boy
all freaked out.

35:28.409 --> 35:29.735
- I love that episode.
- (LAUGHS)

35:30.623 --> 35:33.728
Hey, you remember when Obie
brought Kyle Max's suede pump,

35:33.753 --> 35:37.103
and Kyle was like, "And to think
I actually drank out of this."

35:37.230 --> 35:38.423
(BOTH LAUGHING)

35:39.357 --> 35:40.993
That was so nasty.

35:42.001 --> 35:43.923
RANDALL (LAUGHING): Oh, man.

35:43.948 --> 35:45.782
Well, now I don't want
to watch it without you.

35:46.907 --> 35:48.454
Go. What are you talking about?

35:49.074 --> 35:50.212
No.

35:51.175 --> 35:52.520
I'm coming home.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.621
Go get William's syrup.

35:54.673 --> 35:56.384
Tell him the one that he likes
is in aisle four.

35:56.409 --> 35:57.609
Are you sure?

35:57.770 --> 35:59.404
'Cause I don't mind you having your day.

35:59.429 --> 36:00.556
I'm sure.

36:02.378 --> 36:04.017
And Kevin's out of toilet paper.

36:04.042 --> 36:05.837
He likes the lavender-scented one.

36:05.862 --> 36:07.103
Pick up the lavender-scented one.

36:07.171 --> 36:08.267
I'm on it.

36:15.822 --> 36:18.431
I am tired of having this fight.

36:18.744 --> 36:22.275
We have been having the same
fight ever since we met.

36:22.400 --> 36:23.978
I don't want to be swallowed up by you,

36:24.003 --> 36:26.509
and then you sweet-talk me and
do whatever the hell you want.

36:27.345 --> 36:29.406
You have turned me into your mother.

36:29.431 --> 36:30.548
Beth, don't bring my mother into this.

36:30.573 --> 36:31.829
Well, she's already in it.

36:32.494 --> 36:34.751
You don't even realize it,
but they're both in it.

36:37.311 --> 36:38.907
Admit that you think

36:38.932 --> 36:41.142
that your job
is more important than mine.

36:41.602 --> 36:43.181
- That's absurd.
- Admit it.

36:43.690 --> 36:46.329
Admit to me that you hated the fact

36:46.360 --> 36:48.610
that I had something happening
for myself.

36:48.635 --> 36:50.212
- JACK: I hated that you lied
- REBECCA: No.

36:50.237 --> 36:51.689
about working with your ex-boyfriend.

36:51.714 --> 36:52.881
<i>REBECCA: No, that's total BS, Jack.</i>

36:52.906 --> 36:54.532
Come on, Randall, admit it.

36:54.557 --> 36:55.610
No.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.576
I will not be bullied into
saying something

36:57.601 --> 36:59.290
even more awful to you.

36:59.946 --> 37:03.032
I will not speak that way
to you. I won't do it.

37:03.094 --> 37:04.243
No. You didn't want me to have a career.

37:04.268 --> 37:06.164
- Career? You are a 40-year-old woman
- Yes career.

37:06.189 --> 37:09.439
singing covers in pubs.
That is not a career, Rebecca.

37:09.464 --> 37:10.876
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

37:11.535 --> 37:13.353
We made a promise to one another

37:14.198 --> 37:17.150
that we would never get lost
in each other,

37:17.175 --> 37:18.709
and I broke that promise.

37:20.837 --> 37:22.126
And you let me.

37:22.528 --> 37:27.992
You have let me bend to your
every need time and time again.

37:28.017 --> 37:30.703
Oh, we have kids,
I have to step back from my job.

37:30.728 --> 37:33.181
You quit your job, I work overtime.

37:33.206 --> 37:36.126
You have a dream of buying
your father's building,

37:36.151 --> 37:37.618
it becomes my dream, too.

37:37.643 --> 37:40.204
You run for city councilman,
I stand by your side.

37:40.229 --> 37:42.689
You win city councilman, now what?

37:43.013 --> 37:44.980
I'm supposed to give up what I love

37:45.237 --> 37:46.892
to become a politician's wife?

37:46.938 --> 37:49.673
How many dinners am I supposed
to go to, Randall? And how long?

37:50.626 --> 37:52.882
And what if city council isn't enough?

37:52.907 --> 37:54.431
- What then?
- That's not what I want.

37:54.456 --> 37:57.091
No, I finally have something;
I have something

37:57.116 --> 38:00.767
that I have been looking for
longer than I knew,

38:00.868 --> 38:03.618
and I am not going to give that up.

38:04.993 --> 38:06.642
I am not going to bend.

38:10.156 --> 38:11.650
And that's the problem.

38:12.925 --> 38:16.548
Our lives don't work
unless I'm doing the bending.

38:17.707 --> 38:18.728
It doesn't.

38:20.274 --> 38:21.681
And we both know it.

38:39.290 --> 38:40.790
No, please. I... (SIGHS)

38:40.921 --> 38:42.833
I can see your mind working

38:42.858 --> 38:45.632
and-and you looking
for the perfect words

38:45.657 --> 38:47.311
to make this better,
and I don't want that.

38:47.336 --> 38:48.454
I don't want it.

38:49.134 --> 38:50.775
Because you're too good at it.

38:51.376 --> 38:53.618
You're unbelievable at it, in fact.

38:53.643 --> 38:55.298
And you say the right speech

38:55.323 --> 38:57.423
and have the whole world eating
out of your palm.

38:57.519 --> 38:58.860
Me, especially.

39:06.926 --> 39:08.008
(BETH SIGHS)

39:08.385 --> 39:11.478
No. No, I don't accept that, Beth.

39:11.503 --> 39:14.047
I'm not... I'm not going along
with this revisionist history.

39:14.072 --> 39:15.973
Revisionist history? Okay...

39:15.998 --> 39:19.674
Okay, in what universe
have I been steamrolling you

39:19.699 --> 39:21.204
for the past 20 years?

39:21.985 --> 39:23.562
I mean, your whole persona

39:23.587 --> 39:26.548
is driven by you being
the head of this family.

39:26.573 --> 39:29.708
So I'm-a ask you again:
in what ridiculous universe

39:29.733 --> 39:33.157
are you this wallflower that's
just been steamrolled by me?

39:33.182 --> 39:34.915
And these are not my words, Beth.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.368
This is your M.O.

39:36.525 --> 39:39.156
So, please, please do not self-protect

39:39.181 --> 39:41.098
- by putting this on me.
- That is not what I'm doing.

39:41.123 --> 39:42.501
The hell it's not.

39:43.196 --> 39:44.777
I refuse to be blamed for the fact

39:44.802 --> 39:47.838
that you had your awakening
20 years too late.

39:48.103 --> 39:49.859
At any other point in our marriage,

39:49.884 --> 39:51.915
if you had decided
you wanted to go back to dance,

39:51.940 --> 39:53.930
I would have been
nothing but supportive.

39:53.955 --> 39:55.337
Oh, so when would I have done that, huh?

39:55.362 --> 39:57.228
Between which of your anxiety attacks?

40:07.673 --> 40:09.687
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:09.712 --> 40:11.165
I shouldn't have s... I...

40:11.637 --> 40:12.884
I did not mean...

40:14.710 --> 40:15.821
â™ª

40:24.096 --> 40:25.384
Where are you going?

40:29.704 --> 40:30.845
To Philly.

40:31.312 --> 40:33.751
'Cause I don't want to be in
this house with you right now.

40:35.872 --> 40:37.892
Well, it's good news for you, I guess.

40:38.794 --> 40:40.275
I'm all out of speeches.
