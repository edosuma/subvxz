MAN:
Yo! Cab!

01:03.701 --> 01:06.601
Taxi!

01:29.901 --> 01:32.834
Where to?

01:34.334 --> 01:36.267
51st street, please.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.033
Oh, right.

01:42.567 --> 01:45.167
Do you mind the dog
being in the cab, do you?

01:45.200 --> 01:48.133
No. He doesn't mind me
being in it, does he?

01:48.167 --> 01:49.667
Don't worry about him.

01:49.701 --> 01:51.267
He's very well trained.

01:51.300 --> 01:52.567
He just got out
of obedience school.

01:52.601 --> 01:53.734
I take him everywhere with me.

01:53.767 --> 01:55.767
I just won him in a poker game
a few weeks back.

01:55.801 --> 01:57.000
It's a beautiful dog, isn't he?

01:57.033 --> 01:59.234
Yeah, he sure is beautiful.

01:59.267 --> 02:00.534
Name is Hamlet.

02:00.567 --> 02:03.133
You can probably guess
why I call him Hamlet.

02:03.167 --> 02:06.267
Grew up in a small town?

02:06.300 --> 02:09.133
No. Because he's
a Great Dane.

02:09.167 --> 02:12.901
You know, Hamlet,
the Dane in the play.

02:12.934 --> 02:14.901
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14.934 --> 02:17.000
Very intelligent dog, too.

02:17.033 --> 02:18.434
Watch, I'll show you.

02:18.467 --> 02:20.868
Speak, Hamlet. Speak.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.934
Come on, Hamlet, speak.

02:25.968 --> 02:27.968
Come on, Hamlet, speak.

02:28.033 --> 02:33.267
"O, what a rogue
and peasant slave am I!"

02:33.300 --> 02:37.234
Come on, Hamlet, speak,
you stupid dog.

02:37.267 --> 02:38.601
Come on, speak!

02:38.634 --> 02:40.467
That's okay. If he thinks
of something to say later on

02:40.501 --> 02:42.367
he can call me.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.901
Uh, it's a buck 65.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.234
There you go.

02:49.267 --> 02:50.968
Ah, that's all right.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.234
Thank you.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.467
You know, he really is
a very smart dog.

02:54.501 --> 02:56.234
I don't know
what's wrong with him today.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.000
Hold out your hand,
he'll give you his paw.

02:58.033 --> 02:59.634
Uh, no, I don't
think I better.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.033
No, no, no.
Come on, hold out your hand,

03:01.067 --> 03:02.534
he'll give you his paw.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.234
Give him your paw, Ham.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.467
I said paw, not floor.

03:06.501 --> 03:07.467
Ah, that's okay.

03:07.501 --> 03:08.601
No, it isn't okay.

03:08.634 --> 03:10.767
Get up from there,
you stupid dog.

03:10.801 --> 03:12.300
Come on,
get up from there!
Hey, that's o...

03:12.334 --> 03:13.467
Hey, mister, what
are you doing?

03:13.501 --> 03:15.334
Get up from there.
Well, he's got to learn.
Hey, what are...

03:15.367 --> 03:16.400
Get up from there.

03:16.434 --> 03:17.601
( <i>dog whimpers</i> )
Hey, don't hit the dog.

03:17.634 --> 03:19.667
You-- It's my dog.
I'll hit him if I want to.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.467
Get up from there
you stupid dog.
Come on, it's my cab.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.300
Don't hit the dog
in my cab.
I said, get up from there!

03:23.334 --> 03:24.834
Hey, mister, you hear
what I said?
When I tell you to get up

03:24.868 --> 03:26.234
Will you cut it out?
get up from there.

03:26.267 --> 03:27.601
Hey, mister, will you
cut that out?
Get up from there,

03:27.634 --> 03:29.234
you stupid dog.
Hey, give me that.
Give me that.

03:29.267 --> 03:30.667
What...?
Get out of my cab.

03:30.701 --> 03:31.667
Go on. Get out of here.

03:31.701 --> 03:33.767
All right.
Come on, Hamlet.

03:33.801 --> 03:35.534
Hamlet, come out here!

03:35.567 --> 03:37.033
Come...!

03:37.067 --> 03:40.133
Hey, you got
my dog in there!

03:57.667 --> 04:00.501
Hi. It's Bobby Wheeler.

04:00.534 --> 04:01.834
Any messages?

04:01.868 --> 04:04.667
Well, a-are you sure?

04:04.701 --> 04:10.601
Yeah, okay, well,
just check again, all right?

04:10.634 --> 04:12.734
O-okay. Now, listen.
I'm down at the garage.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.133
If anybody calls,
you give them the number.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.166
All right.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.467
Hey, what are you doing, man?

04:24.501 --> 04:25.834
Let me go, Tony.
I got to hit something.

04:25.868 --> 04:26.834
Hey, what are you crazy?

04:26.868 --> 04:28.868
I can see you're upset,
but, uh, don't hit that.

04:28.901 --> 04:30.033
You could really hurt yourself.

04:30.067 --> 04:31.033
Yeah, well,
I don't care, man,

04:31.067 --> 04:32.133
'cause I got to hit something.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.334
All right,
all right. Here.

04:33.367 --> 04:35.734
Hit me. Here,
in the stomach.
Go ahead.

04:35.767 --> 04:36.834
I can't do that.

04:36.868 --> 04:39.367
Come on, don't worry about it.
I'm hard as a rock.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.701
I do 200 sit-ups a day.

04:40.734 --> 04:42.734
I go to the gym, guys
hit me all the time.

04:42.767 --> 04:44.601
It's part of my training.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

04:44.634 --> 04:45.934
You're sure now, right?

04:45.968 --> 04:47.300
Go ahead. Hard as
you can. Go ahead.

04:48.334 --> 04:50.167
Oh, Tony!
I'm sorry.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.601
Are you okay?

04:52.634 --> 04:54.033
I'm fine. I'm fine.

04:54.067 --> 04:57.534
Hey, listen, if it makes you
feel any better,

04:57.567 --> 04:58.601
I feel great.

04:58.634 --> 05:00.968
Great.
Anytime I can help.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.367
I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry, Tony.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.467
Hey, hey, John?

05:04.501 --> 05:05.834
John, don't use
that phone, okay?

05:07.167 --> 05:09.501
John, I said
don't use that phone!

05:15.868 --> 05:17.467
LOUIE:
Hey, Bob.

05:17.501 --> 05:20.901
Is it all right if
John uses the toilet?

05:20.934 --> 05:22.767
Just lay off, Louie, okay?

05:22.801 --> 05:25.267
I got a lot of things
on my mind.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.634
Hi, boys.

05:26.667 --> 05:27.934
Hi, Alex.

05:27.968 --> 05:29.067
Hi.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.601
Hey, listen, um, could
you do me a favor?

05:30.634 --> 05:32.667
Yeah?
I'm expecting a call
any minute, you know.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.133
And could you wait with me?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.834
'Cause I don't want to
be alone when I get it.

05:35.868 --> 05:37.501
Yeah, sure.
What kind of phone call?

05:37.534 --> 05:39.000
Well, you see...

05:39.033 --> 05:40.000
LATKA:
Alex. Yo.

05:40.033 --> 05:42.834
I find...
I find in your cab.

05:42.868 --> 05:44.067
Yeah, I know.

05:44.100 --> 05:46.501
Oh, my gosh.
Look at him.

05:46.534 --> 05:48.133
Wow. Where'd you find him?

05:48.167 --> 05:49.501
I took him away from
some guy in my cab.

05:49.534 --> 05:51.000
He was whipping him
with his leash.

05:51.033 --> 05:53.367
Hey, you shouldn't do that, boy.
You could hurt somebody.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.701
ALEX:
Not him.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.534
Hey, Alex...

05:56.567 --> 05:57.534
He's so gorgeous.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.801
What's his name?

05:58.834 --> 05:59.801
Alex, you see,
this phone call...

05:59.834 --> 06:01.100
His name is Hamlet.

06:01.133 --> 06:02.434
Are you going to him?

06:02.467 --> 06:03.434
Well, I guess so.

06:03.467 --> 06:04.968
Till I can find
a better home for him.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.367
Hey, Latka, will you do me a
favor and get Hamlet some water?

06:08.400 --> 06:11.200
Come on.
Oh, I'm sorry, Bobby.

06:11.234 --> 06:13.634
Uh, you were telling me
about this phone call.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.634
Yeah, it...
Hey, so what's doing here?

06:14.667 --> 06:15.968
Are we getting
breakfast or what?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.501
Hey, what's this phone call
you're waiting for?

06:17.534 --> 06:20.000
It's about an acting job.

06:20.033 --> 06:20.801
Oh...

06:20.834 --> 06:22.000
Yeah, I'm up for the lead

06:22.033 --> 06:23.300
in an off-broadway play.

06:23.334 --> 06:24.667
That's something.
All right!

06:24.701 --> 06:26.033
Yeah, but the thing is

06:26.067 --> 06:27.834
it's down between me
and two other guys

06:27.868 --> 06:30.300
and they said they'd let me know
this morning. So...

06:30.334 --> 06:31.834
Stuff like that's
always happening to you.

06:31.868 --> 06:33.200
This is special?

06:33.234 --> 06:36.234
Yeah. See, that's why I wanted
to talk to you, Alex.

06:36.267 --> 06:39.033
I've got this whole
thing like, I...

06:41.000 --> 06:42.567
All right, all right.
Everybody sit down.

06:42.601 --> 06:43.601
I'll tell you

06:47.200 --> 06:49.501
See, when I first came
to New York...

06:49.534 --> 06:51.033
Where did you
come from, Bobby?

06:51.067 --> 06:52.367
The Bronx.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.868
I made this deal with myself.

06:58.901 --> 07:00.968
I mean, I knew how
there were thousands

07:01.000 --> 07:02.601
of starving actors here

07:02.634 --> 07:05.167
and how it's a rotten life
and how very few make it

07:05.200 --> 07:07.667
and how you can get old trying,
you know?

07:07.701 --> 07:09.767
So I gave myself
a strict time limit.

07:09.801 --> 07:11.400
Three years.

07:11.434 --> 07:13.033
Three years to get started
as an actor.

07:13.067 --> 07:15.300
Now, I promised myself,
if in that amount of time

07:15.334 --> 07:17.100
if I didn't get
a paid acting job

07:17.133 --> 07:19.968
I'd give it up,
get a regular full-time job

07:20.000 --> 07:21.601
and never think
about acting again.

07:21.634 --> 07:23.534
I mean a guy
can't go on

07:23.567 --> 07:24.701
like I've been doing forever.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.734
You know, beating my brains out
here six nights a week.

07:26.767 --> 07:29.200
Spending my days trying out for
something that might not happen.

07:29.234 --> 07:30.968
I mean, there's got
to be a limit.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.701
I figured three years.

07:32.734 --> 07:35.367
I mean, how could I not get a
job in three years, you know?

07:39.267 --> 07:41.834
Three years are up today.

07:41.868 --> 07:44.367
I mean, my life is riding
on this job, you know?

07:44.400 --> 07:46.667
I got to get this part, Alex.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.667
You see, that's-that's why
I wanted you to be with me.

07:48.701 --> 07:49.868
Yeah, I know.
Well, listen...

07:49.901 --> 07:52.501
'Cause you know how
much I want to act.

07:52.534 --> 07:56.767
It's the only thing
in the world that...

07:56.801 --> 07:59.000
that really matters to me.

07:59.033 --> 08:00.033
Yeah, I know...

08:00.067 --> 08:01.100
I mean, if they call
up and they tell me

08:01.133 --> 08:02.701
that they're gonna pick
one of those other guys,

08:02.734 --> 08:04.400
Alex, I don't know
what I'm going to do.

08:04.434 --> 08:05.601
W-What are you going to do?

08:05.634 --> 08:07.467
So, they pick another guy. I
mean, It's not the world, is it?

08:07.501 --> 08:10.100
MAN:
All right, I
want my dog.

08:10.133 --> 08:11.133
Where's my dog?

08:11.167 --> 08:12.467
I'll right back to you,
Bobby.

08:12.501 --> 08:13.634
I got to deal
with this guy first.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.868
Come on, where is he?
Hamlet?!

08:15.901 --> 08:16.901
Hamlet?!

08:16.934 --> 08:18.133
Oh, there he is.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.801
Would you give me
that dog, please?

08:19.834 --> 08:20.968
What dog?

08:21.000 --> 08:21.968
Well, that dog.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.133
That's my dog.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.567
I don't see any dog.
What dog are you talking about?

08:25.601 --> 08:26.868
ELAINE:
Yeah, I don't see
any dog either.

08:26.901 --> 08:28.167
Dog? What dog?

08:28.200 --> 08:30.834
Hey, Fred, do you see a dog?
What dog?

08:30.868 --> 08:32.234
There isn't
any dog here.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.299
Oh, I get it.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.467
You guys are looking
for trouble, huh?

08:34.501 --> 08:35.667
LOUIE:
Hey!

08:35.701 --> 08:37.033
What's going on out here?

08:37.067 --> 08:38.967
Are you in charge here?

08:40.534 --> 08:42.868
Do old ladies get mugged?

08:44.701 --> 08:49.634
Well, that dog is my dog,
and I want him now.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.300
Hey, Louie, we don't know
what this guy's talking about.

08:52.334 --> 08:54.701
You don't see
no dog here, do ya?

08:54.734 --> 08:58.501
Uh... yeah...
I got something in my eyes.

08:58.534 --> 08:59.801
I can't see anything.

08:59.834 --> 09:02.133
I can't see if there's
a dog here or not.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.234
Anybody got a dollar bill

09:03.267 --> 09:06.200
I could wipe the sweat
out of my eyes?

09:06.234 --> 09:08.300
ALEX:
Here, Louie.

09:08.334 --> 09:12.467
There's no dog here, mister.

09:12.501 --> 09:15.167
You guys think
you're pretty cute, don't you?

09:15.200 --> 09:17.133
Well, you'd better
give me that dog

09:17.167 --> 09:18.801
and you'd better
give him to me right now,

09:18.834 --> 09:20.067
because if you don't,

09:20.100 --> 09:22.300
I'm going straight from here
to the police.

09:22.334 --> 09:23.200
Oh...

09:23.234 --> 09:24.200
Now, does anybody want

09:24.234 --> 09:25.400
to talk to me about that or not?

09:25.434 --> 09:27.033
Sure, you want somebody
to talk to you?

09:27.067 --> 09:28.267
MAN:
Yeah.
Latka.

09:32.167 --> 09:34.000
Hi.

( <i>speaking native language</i> )

09:42.100 --> 09:43.567
Go, Latka!

09:43.601 --> 09:46.033
( <i>phone ringing</i> )

09:54.534 --> 09:55.834
Hi.

09:55.868 --> 09:57.167
Yeah, yeah.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.868
This is Bobby Wheeler.

10:01.868 --> 10:05.167
Uh, no, uh...
that's okay, you know.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.868
Right. I-I-I, uh...
I appreciate the call, really.

10:12.067 --> 10:14.067
( <i>sighing</i> )

10:25.067 --> 10:28.067
I didn't get the part, Hamlet.

10:38.567 --> 10:41.033
Here are my
bookings, Louie.

10:41.067 --> 10:42.534
( <i>barking</i> )

10:42.567 --> 10:44.033
( <i>laughing</i> )

10:44.067 --> 10:46.033
That's a good Hamlet.

10:46.067 --> 10:47.200
That's good, Hamlet.

10:47.234 --> 10:48.267
Hey, Louie... Louie...

10:48.300 --> 10:49.434
for God's sake, man,
it's my turn.

10:49.467 --> 10:50.501
Let me have him, huh?

10:50.534 --> 10:52.868
All right, All right.

10:52.901 --> 10:54.901
I'll let you have him,

10:54.934 --> 10:57.467
but only 'cause your dreams
are crashing around you.

10:57.501 --> 10:58.801
Thanks.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.234
Good boy.

11:00.267 --> 11:01.767
Good boy. Yeah.

11:01.801 --> 11:05.400
( <i>groans</i> )

11:05.434 --> 11:07.968
Hey, Bobby, listen,
don't worry about it.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.300
Everything's going
to be okay.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.801
Will you stop talking
to him like that, Elaine?

11:12.834 --> 11:14.567
How is everything be okay?

11:14.601 --> 11:16.133
Look, I don't know
much about acting,

11:16.167 --> 11:18.067
but what I do know is,
if you want a good job

11:18.100 --> 11:20.567
you got to go
stand in line.

11:20.601 --> 11:23.534
If you want to find a good job
acting, find a line to stand in.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.067
Bobby, you're
not going to get anywhere

11:26.100 --> 11:27.601
sitting here
feeling sorry for yourself.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.667
BOBBY:

11:40.634 --> 11:42.601

11:46.801 --> 11:47.767
Hi, Tom.

11:47.801 --> 11:48.767
Hi, Bobby.

11:48.801 --> 11:49.934
Oh, gee, thanks a lot.

11:49.968 --> 11:51.834
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate it. Really.

11:51.868 --> 11:52.868
Oh, don't mention it.

11:52.901 --> 11:53.868
Now, it's just a lucky thing

11:53.901 --> 11:55.367
that you happened
to come by today.
Yeah.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.367
Now, look, Bobby, you do
understand that the director

11:57.400 --> 11:59.300
is doing the casting
on the commercial.

11:59.334 --> 12:00.801
I can't influence him
for you.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.167
Yeah, of course,
but, you know,

12:02.200 --> 12:04.868
any tips on how I might
be able to catch his eye?

12:04.901 --> 12:07.567
Just, uh, be yourself.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.400
I better go rehearse a little.
Okay.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.067
MAN:
<i>Tom?</i>

12:28.300 --> 12:30.000
Tom, okay, I'm ready.

12:30.033 --> 12:31.868
Everybody, everybody,

12:31.901 --> 12:33.534
this is Peter Nicholson
our director.

12:33.567 --> 12:34.767
Thank you.

12:34.801 --> 12:35.901
Okay, now, I'm sure
you're all familiar

12:35.934 --> 12:37.234
with this commercial.

12:37.267 --> 12:39.400
I'd like Tom over here.
Yeah.

12:39.434 --> 12:42.167
And I'd like you all to form
a loose semicircle behind him

12:42.200 --> 12:44.033
with your backs
towards him, please.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.033
Okay?

12:45.067 --> 12:46.534
Now I will cue Tom

12:46.567 --> 12:50.033
and I want you
to react naturally for me, okay?

12:50.067 --> 12:52.067
And... Tom.

and EF Hutton says... "

12:59.901 --> 13:01.100
PETER:
Great!

13:01.133 --> 13:02.133
Okay, thank you.

13:02.167 --> 13:03.701
We'll be in touch.

13:08.234 --> 13:09.400
Thank you.

13:10.434 --> 13:13.400
Uh... Tom,
h-how did I do?

13:13.434 --> 13:16.133
You did fine, just fine,
Bobby, really.

13:16.167 --> 13:18.067
You, uh, think I got a shot?

13:18.100 --> 13:20.000
Yeah, you got a shot!

your commercial?

13:55.467 --> 13:56.934
Just wait

to tell us or not?

Well, wait till
everybody's inside.

So what are we
celebrating, then?

14:10.300 --> 14:11.367
Oh. Well...

14:11.400 --> 14:12.868
My first acting job.

14:12.901 --> 14:14.601
Oh...

You got your first
acting job?

Yay!
Yay!

What is this, some kind
of a new party game here?

14:23.367 --> 14:25.767
Hey, it's okay
that I didn't get a job,

14:25.801 --> 14:27.667
because I'm going to get one.

why don't you just tell us

15:27.801 --> 15:29.000
about the job
you're going to get.

15:29.033 --> 15:30.701
Oh, well...

15:30.734 --> 15:33.434
When I found out I didn't get
the commercial this morning

15:33.467 --> 15:34.701
I really started hustling.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.901
I went into every
casting office in this town.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.667
Some guys even
had me read for parts, you know?

15:38.701 --> 15:41.334
And that's pretty good when
you're going in cold, you know.

15:41.367 --> 15:42.567
Yeah, I'll say.

15:42.601 --> 15:43.601
Who am I kidding?

15:43.634 --> 15:45.200
That's <i>great</i> when
you're going in cold!

15:45.234 --> 15:47.400
And some of them even told me
that I was in the running.

15:47.434 --> 15:49.400
So one of them
should come through, right?

15:49.434 --> 15:50.968
Sure.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.234
I'm gonna get a call on my phone
before midnight tonight

15:53.267 --> 15:54.901
when the three years are up,

15:54.934 --> 15:56.767
and I'm not going to have
to give up acting.

15:56.801 --> 15:59.200
Oh, you know, it's just so great

15:59.234 --> 16:00.667
when you know it
in your heart, man.

16:00.701 --> 16:02.067
You don't have
to sweat it anymore.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.634
( <i>soft agreements</i> )

16:03.667 --> 16:05.300
Well, maybe somebody
is going to call you, Bobby,

16:05.334 --> 16:07.200
but how do you know they're
gonna call before midnight?

16:07.234 --> 16:09.033
Well, that's simple logic.

16:09.067 --> 16:11.667
You see, when you're
good at something

16:11.701 --> 16:14.534
you end up doing it.

16:14.567 --> 16:15.901
Now, I'm not going
to end up acting

16:15.934 --> 16:18.434
unless I get a phone call
before midnight. So...

16:18.467 --> 16:20.133
I'm gonna get a call
before midnight.

16:23.534 --> 16:24.901
Isn't it wonderful?

16:24.934 --> 16:28.434
I mean, so what if he
doesn't get a call tonight?

16:28.467 --> 16:29.901
He's feeling really
great right now.

16:29.934 --> 16:32.234
Yeah. So what if you're
falling off the cliff?

16:32.267 --> 16:34.334
The view is wonderful
on the way down.

16:34.367 --> 16:35.667
What does that mean?

16:35.701 --> 16:37.000
Somebody better tell this guy

16:37.033 --> 16:39.167
that he's setting himself up
for too big a fall.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.367
Alex, don't.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.968
Sure. We all leave here
at 11:59

16:42.000 --> 16:43.234
with a song in our heart,

16:43.267 --> 16:44.868
and hope we don't
hear the thud.

16:44.901 --> 16:46.067
I just don't think
it's appropriate

16:46.100 --> 16:47.334
right now.

16:47.367 --> 16:49.667
Hey, uh, what are you guys
talking about?

16:49.701 --> 16:51.067
Nothing. Alex
is just getting
a little nervous.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.834
Now come on, Elaine.
I got to tell him
what I'm thinking.

16:52.868 --> 16:53.968
I'm his friend.

16:54.000 --> 16:54.968
Hey, don't worry, Alex.

16:55.033 --> 16:56.033
I just explained to you

16:56.067 --> 16:58.200
why I'm gonna get the call
before midnight, right?

16:58.234 --> 16:59.167
Yeah, yeah, I know--

16:59.200 --> 17:00.467
because you're
so good at acting.

17:00.501 --> 17:01.634
Exactly.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.200
Great actors get jobs.

17:03.234 --> 17:04.567
I'm a great actor.

17:04.601 --> 17:06.934
Bobby, we got
to be rational here.

17:06.968 --> 17:07.968
I <i>am</i> being rational.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.067
I'm good.

17:09.099 --> 17:11.434
Good people do what
they're good at and I'm good.

17:11.467 --> 17:12.032
Bobby...

17:12.067 --> 17:13.233
I got to act, Alex,

17:13.267 --> 17:14.334
because I'm good.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.467
Bobby, listen...

17:15.501 --> 17:16.634
I'm good!

17:16.666 --> 17:18.200
Look, just because
someone doesn't call you

17:18.233 --> 17:19.233
by midnight doesn't mean...

17:19.267 --> 17:21.099
The only way that
phone's not gonna ring

17:21.133 --> 17:22.200
before midnight, Alex,

17:22.233 --> 17:23.834
is if I'm not good enough.

17:23.867 --> 17:25.367
And you're not going to tell
me...

17:25.400 --> 17:26.834
Maybe you're not that good.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.067
<i>Yet.</i>

17:31.100 --> 17:32.234
Doesn't mean that

17:32.267 --> 17:33.868
with a little more experience,
you couldn't get there.

17:33.901 --> 17:35.133
All right, Just stop it.
All right?

17:35.167 --> 17:36.300
Now you've said
what you had to say.

17:36.334 --> 17:37.367
Now let me talk, all right?

17:40.667 --> 17:42.567
Well...

17:42.601 --> 17:45.467
When I was six years old,
Alex...

17:45.501 --> 17:47.701
my father died,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.968
and I never had
any older brothers.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.634
Had a couple of older sisters,
but, uh...

17:54.667 --> 17:56.000
till I met you

17:56.033 --> 17:59.033
I don't think there was
ever a man in my life

17:59.067 --> 18:00.968
that I felt was on my side.

18:01.000 --> 18:04.033
I mean, I had lots
of friends and everything,

18:04.067 --> 18:05.334
but I always felt

18:05.367 --> 18:07.701
there was something special
between you and me.

18:07.734 --> 18:11.167
And you
knew that, Alex.

18:11.200 --> 18:14.067
You knew how I...
how I looked up to you

18:14.100 --> 18:17.534
and respected you,
and counted on you.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.067
Oh, come on, Bobby...

18:19.100 --> 18:21.267
Please, just...
let me finish all right?

18:21.300 --> 18:25.200
What you just said just now--

18:25.234 --> 18:29.267
I mean, it would have been okay
coming from a friend,

18:29.300 --> 18:32.000
but not from somebody
I felt about

18:32.033 --> 18:34.601
the way I feel about you.

18:36.501 --> 18:39.033
I don't know
how to tell you, I...

18:39.067 --> 18:41.234
you just hurt
me now, Alex...

18:41.267 --> 18:43.334
Except to say that...

18:43.367 --> 18:45.701
it feels like, uh...

18:45.734 --> 18:49.400
like my father just died again.

18:49.434 --> 18:50.868
Oh, come on, Bobby.

18:50.901 --> 18:53.033
No, it's a little
late for that, man.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.000
I needed you
and you let me down.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.467
I needed you, Alex.

18:56.501 --> 18:58.534
Bobby, Alex is only
trying to...

18:58.567 --> 18:59.934
You stay out of
this, Elaine!

18:59.968 --> 19:02.667
It's between
Alex and me.

19:02.701 --> 19:04.367
There's only one thing

19:04.400 --> 19:06.868
that I want
from you right now, Alex.

19:06.901 --> 19:10.200
And that's for you
to get out of here.

19:10.234 --> 19:13.868
( <i>voice breaking</i> ):
I don't want to see you again.

19:13.901 --> 19:15.968
I don't want to talk to you.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.234
I don't want to know you, man!

19:18.267 --> 19:20.000
Bobby...

19:20.033 --> 19:21.501
All right, come on,
all right?

19:21.534 --> 19:22.801
Just get out, all right?!

19:22.834 --> 19:24.367
Just get the hell
out of here!

19:30.167 --> 19:33.734
You still say I'm
not such a good actor?

19:47.901 --> 19:50.100
Hey, that
was something.

19:50.133 --> 19:51.968
( <i>laughing</i> )

19:53.968 --> 19:56.834
You bastard.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.000
Now, baby, ring.

20:05.033 --> 20:07.868
Come on, ring.

20:07.901 --> 20:10.367
Blap. Blap.

20:14.734 --> 20:17.067
It's two minutes to 12:00,
Bobby.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.934
Yeah, I know what time it is,
Elaine,

20:18.968 --> 20:21.601
but please stop telling me
what time it is.

20:21.634 --> 20:23.334
I mean, it's going to ring
before midnight

20:23.367 --> 20:24.701
and then that's that, you know?

20:24.734 --> 20:27.367
I haven't said this yet,
but it's going to ring.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.367
Okay, now hold it down

20:29.400 --> 20:32.467
because it's, like,
only 40 seconds left.

20:32.501 --> 20:34.734
It's going to ring.
I just know it.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.033
It's going to ring.

20:41.601 --> 20:43.868
Maybe your watch is off.

20:43.901 --> 20:45.234
No.

20:45.267 --> 20:49.601
It has to be by my watch.

20:49.634 --> 20:51.834
Ten, nine,

20:51.868 --> 20:55.601
eight, seven, six,

20:55.634 --> 20:57.934
five, four,

20:57.968 --> 20:59.434
three,

20:59.467 --> 21:00.767
two,

21:00.801 --> 21:02.267
one,

21:02.300 --> 21:03.501
zero.

21:03.534 --> 21:04.734
Zero.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.133
Zero.

21:10.534 --> 21:11.801
Zero.

21:25.567 --> 21:30.033
I-I promised myself
that I'd quit acting...

21:30.067 --> 21:33.601
and get a job in three years.

21:33.634 --> 21:36.634
Well, it's...
it's been three years.

21:38.634 --> 21:40.000
Aw, what the hell.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.601
I'll give myself
another three years.

21:54.367 --> 21:55.934
MAN:
<i>There he is.</i>

21:55.968 --> 21:57.767
That's my dog.

21:57.801 --> 21:59.734
( <i>clearing throat</i> )

21:59.767 --> 22:00.968
Excuse me.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.634
Hamlet, come over here.

22:02.667 --> 22:03.901
( <i>Hamlet growls</i> )

22:03.934 --> 22:05.334
I'll teach you
to growl at me.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.367
Wait till I get you home!

22:06.400 --> 22:08.000
Officer, where
is this insane man

22:08.033 --> 22:09.100
going with my dog?

22:09.133 --> 22:10.100
Your dog?

22:10.133 --> 22:12.067
See, he admits it.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.234
Officer, this is my dog
and I'm taking him.

22:14.267 --> 22:17.000
Officer, this is my dog
and he's not going anywhere.

22:17.033 --> 22:18.868
Why don't you just
stand them at a distance

22:18.901 --> 22:20.033
and let them call the dog?

22:20.067 --> 22:22.200
Whichever one he goes
to gets the dog, right?

22:22.234 --> 22:23.868
This guy ought to run
for borough president.

22:23.901 --> 22:26.000
All right, Officer,
where do I stand?

22:26.033 --> 22:27.601
You stand over there.
Fine.

22:27.634 --> 22:28.968
Where do I stand?

22:29.033 --> 22:31.000
And you stand over there.

22:36.534 --> 22:38.133
Sit, boy.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.400
Now, when I say so,

22:40.434 --> 22:42.300
I want you both
to call the dog's name.

22:42.334 --> 22:44.000
And whichever one he goes to,
that's the dog's owner,

22:44.033 --> 22:45.200
and that's that, okay?

22:45.234 --> 22:46.200
Okay.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.200
Okay.

22:47.234 --> 22:48.334
Okay.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.734
Oh, one second.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.801
Huh?

23:02.968 --> 23:04.801
What was that all about?

23:04.834 --> 23:08.267
I just want to make sure
no one's carrying any meat.

23:11.701 --> 23:13.934
Okay, call the dog.

23:13.968 --> 23:14.934
Hamlet.

23:14.968 --> 23:15.934
Hamlet.

23:15.968 --> 23:16.934
Hamlet.
Hamlet, come here.

23:16.968 --> 23:17.968
Come over here,
Hamlet.
Come on, Hamlet.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.000
Hamlet.
Hamlet.

23:19.033 --> 23:20.434
Hamlet, come over here.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.534
Come over here!

23:21.567 --> 23:22.634
Hamlet, come over here!

23:22.667 --> 23:23.734
( <i>muttering</i> )

23:23.767 --> 23:24.834
Come over here!

23:24.868 --> 23:26.234
Wait till I get you.

23:26.267 --> 23:27.334
Come over here.

23:27.367 --> 23:28.934
You come over here!

23:28.968 --> 23:30.934
Come over here
when I tell you.

23:30.968 --> 23:32.100
Come over here.

23:32.133 --> 23:33.300
( <i>all sighing</i> )

23:33.334 --> 23:35.100
Well, I guess
that's that.

23:35.133 --> 23:36.634
Hey, man,
why would he do that?

23:36.667 --> 23:38.501
Go with the guy
that beats him?

23:38.534 --> 23:39.667
( <i>growling</i> )

23:39.701 --> 23:41.300
MAN:
It's his dog!
It's his dog!

23:41.334 --> 23:42.834
It's his dog!

23:50.501 --> 23:53.234
