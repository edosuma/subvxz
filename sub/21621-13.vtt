00:08.876 --> 00:11.712
-Thanks for giving me a ride today.
-Yeah.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.647
Here's what we're gonna do, Dierks.

00:13.714 --> 00:14.715
Hit it

00:21.855 --> 00:23.156
-"Either".
-Oh, s***.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.926
Oh, not yet.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.795
Hang on. I've got to hit it.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.397
Hit it

00:30.464 --> 00:31.899
-We got to nail it.
-Hit it

00:31.965 --> 00:34.101
-Oh, come on.
-Hit it

00:34.134 --> 00:36.103
-OK, one more time.
-Hit it

01:03.463 --> 01:04.565
Or something.

01:10.737 --> 01:11.738
Hello.

01:58.886 --> 02:02.890
Do you find that people cannot
figure out how to spell your name?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.092
-Yeah.
-I get Cheryl with a C.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.560
-In fact, I was not...
-It's not?

02:08.127 --> 02:10.264
-How you doing?
-What?

02:10.330 --> 02:13.367
Hey, this is my friend Sheryl Crow.
I'm Dierks Bentley.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.968
-Hey.
-How you doing?

02:15.068 --> 02:15.936
Nice to meet you.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.305
-Do you know who Sheryl Crow is?
-I do.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.074
-And Dierks Bentley.
-Do you know how to spell "Sheryl Crow"?

02:21.141 --> 02:24.244
C-H-E-R-Y-L-Y...

02:24.311 --> 02:25.612
I'm not a good speller.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.181
What about "Dierks"?

02:27.247 --> 02:28.315
D-E-R-K.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.083
-You got it.
-Perfect. Awesome.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.785
Thank you. Have a great day.

02:31.852 --> 02:35.255
I'm not gonna tell anybody you're here
because you'll get mobbed.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.090
Thank you.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.126
-How are you doing?
-How y'all doing?

02:39.193 --> 02:41.328
-How do you spell "Sheryl Crow", S or C?
-C.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.664
-How do you spell "Dierks"?
-Dierks?

02:45.599 --> 02:48.869
-Oh, that's a hard one. With a D?
-Yeah, with a D.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.637
-Hi.
-How y'all doing?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.339
Do you know how to spell "Sheryl"?

02:52.406 --> 02:55.409
-C-H-E-R-Y-L.
-No, it's S-H.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.710
How do you spell "Crow"?

02:56.777 --> 02:59.112
C-R-O-W.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.747
-You got that.
-You're redeemed.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.249
-Hey.
-Good afternoon.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.851
-Hello.
-I'm glad to meet you.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.419
Where are you from? Scotland?

03:05.485 --> 03:08.155
-Toronto, Ontario in Canada.
-Damn.

03:08.222 --> 03:10.090
Do you know how to spell "Sheryl"?

03:10.157 --> 03:11.225
-S?
-Yes.

03:11.291 --> 03:13.527
S-C-H-E-R-L-E.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.163
And how... Mm. And how about "Crow"?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.831
C-R-O-W...

03:17.898 --> 03:19.066
-E.
-E? Yes.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.100
And how about "Dierks"?

03:20.167 --> 03:22.769
D-I-R-K-S.

03:22.836 --> 03:25.305
-That's close enough.
-Yeah. Right on.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.773
-Are you Dierks?
-Yeah.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.310
Well, we're not doing so good.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.578
-No.
-We love you.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.446
Wow.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.815
-Hi, guys.
-Can I get a picture with you?

03:34.882 --> 03:36.683
-Can you lean back a little?
-Yeah.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.784
I'm kidding.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.907
I like your technique.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.208
Rap style.

04:11.718 --> 04:14.388
I think the guy next to us
is singing it too. See him?

04:14.454 --> 04:15.289
Look at that.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.948
Do you ever have a guy do that to you,
like...

04:41.548 --> 04:44.284
...yawn and "I know what I was feeling"
kind of reach like that?

04:44.351 --> 04:47.921
And then go like that? And then they're
like, "Wait, why is there nothing there?"

04:48.889 --> 04:50.991
-B*******.
-And he's like, "What was I thinking?"

04:53.760 --> 04:56.163
-What is your biggest karaoke song?
-"Picture".

04:56.230 --> 04:58.665
-Right under "Free Bird".
-I've karaoked "Picture".

04:58.732 --> 05:01.368
-I have.
-Have you done "Picture"?

05:01.435 --> 05:05.405
I've never karaoked except to my own song,
and I don't think that's karaoking.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.876
I think that's just being drunk in a bar
and singing your own song.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.178
-Nailed it.
-We should do a remix of that.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.347
-Of just us doing it.
-Take it to number one again.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.117
Recycle that baby
and get it back to number one.

05:50.184 --> 05:52.352
Just change one or two little things.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.217
-Undoubtedly.
-Yes.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.619
-Let's get someone to sing with us.
-Let's do it.

07:37.424 --> 07:40.460
-How about that guy?
-Hey! Guitar!

07:41.061 --> 07:43.063
-I just called him "guitar".
-Guitar.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.233
-Hi, I take it you're a musician.
-I'm trying to be.

07:46.300 --> 07:50.404
-You are? I'm Sheryl by the way.
-Nice to meet you. I'm David.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.073
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Do you know any Sheryl songs?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.541
-Yeah.
-Key of G?

07:54.608 --> 07:57.477
-Key of G!
-Jump in the back.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.646
-All right.
-Look at you.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.915
You don't even have a case.
You're ready to play.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.918
-I'm trying to make this thing happen.
-That's it.

08:07.321 --> 08:10.357
-We're off to a good start.
-He's got D and C down.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.428
-Can you spell "Dierks"?
-Don't worry about that.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.150
-Damn.
-Wow. I'm very impressed.

08:39.620 --> 08:43.557
-Have you got one of yours?
-Sure. We can try one out.

08:46.593 --> 08:49.596
This is how songs get pitched
in Nashville all the time.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.864
Look out.

08:50.931 --> 08:54.067
Pull down the shades
and lock all the doors

08:54.067 --> 08:57.604
Throw a blanket down on the floor

08:57.671 --> 08:59.973
This could be a new version of
American Idol.

09:00.007 --> 09:03.110
Just me and you
Somebody cue the rain

09:03.177 --> 09:07.581
If I had the button to turn my seat
around, I'd be like, "You're great."

09:07.648 --> 09:09.016
-I'll take it.
-You're good.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.384
-Thanks, man.
-That's great.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.420
-David Oakleaf.
-David Oakleaf.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.622
-Thanks, guys. I appreciate the ride.
-You're welcome.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.632
-How many gigs have you done in a day?
-I don't know. Maybe three.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.135
Let's see how many gigs
we can do in half an hour.

09:28.202 --> 09:32.239
How many times can we pull over,
run in, play something, and then...

09:32.306 --> 09:36.410
Run into the bar? When they see
Sheryl Crow, they're gonna go crazy.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.646
To be perfectly honest, the people
that we talked to today,

09:39.713 --> 09:42.449
I'm not sure anybody's gonna even know
that it's me.

09:42.516 --> 09:44.218
I think we're gonna be fine.

09:49.223 --> 09:50.958
-OK. Let's do it.
-Yeah.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.896
Hi, guys, how are you?

09:55.963 --> 09:59.099
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dierks Bentley and Sheryl Crow.

09:59.166 --> 10:02.903
We're trying to do
as many gigs as we can in 30 minutes.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.972
Let's do a little Waylon Jennings.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.112
-Hello over there.
-You guys are so amazing.

10:45.179 --> 10:47.514
We got to put some money in the tip jar
before we leave.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.816
Thank you for letting us stop by.

10:50.751 --> 10:54.121
We've got to go. Next stop.
We've got to hurry.

10:54.521 --> 10:55.455
Let's do it.

10:58.392 --> 10:59.660
Yeah!

11:01.361 --> 11:04.198
Thanks to these guys
for letting us sing a song.

11:04.264 --> 11:08.168
This is the second stop of many.
Thank you so much, we've got to go.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.203
Thank you, guys.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.140
This is crazy.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.410
Where the hell did you all come from?

11:21.748 --> 11:23.684
That was great, man. Thank you.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.789
-This might be the last one.
-Let's do it.

11:28.856 --> 11:33.093
Somebody got a new hairdo. I like it.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.432
I'm Dierks, this is Sheryl.
We've been up and down the block.

11:38.498 --> 11:42.503
It's good to walk in and hear some
real country music playing out there.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.140
Four, and no fights.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.442
Hi. How are you?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.978
-Look how cute she is.
-It's so good to see you.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.381
-Can we play a song to break our record?
-Oh, yes.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.130
-I love you both.
-Thank you.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.098
-We did it.
-Five. Five gigs.
