missing for 20 years

<i>suddenly turns up at a crime scene.</i>

00:06.095 --> 00:07.415
Are you Jesse?

00:07.575 --> 00:09.735
- Are you gonna tell us your name now?
- Joe Hanley.

00:09.895 --> 00:11.975
Unless you can come up with
something inventive

00:12.135 --> 00:14.415
to charge him with,
I'd like my client released.

00:14.575 --> 00:17.535
I'm chasing round town showing
people photos of a dead woman.

00:17.695 --> 00:20.855
She's not a prossie. Her name wasn't
Annie Green. She's called Selena.

00:21.935 --> 00:24.695
[Slade] We've all done things
to survive and to cope.

00:24.855 --> 00:26.575
[Mark]
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

00:26.735 --> 00:28.495
- He's my husband.

[frenzied screams]

00:34.855 --> 00:37.135
The guy who took her...
I helped him.

00:37.295 --> 00:38.935
You are a victim.

00:39.095 --> 00:40.695
Any idea where this house was?

00:40.855 --> 00:43.055
I could see a building,

00:43.215 --> 00:46.095
shaped like an upside-down umbrella.

00:46.735 --> 00:49.615
Jay Newman? Do you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

00:49.775 --> 00:52.255
- Feel free to have a look around.
- [Ally] You're still suspicious?

01:56.455 --> 01:58.695
- Then you keep following that road.
- [Britnay] Run.

01:58.855 --> 02:00.295
- What?
- Run!

02:02.135 --> 02:04.335

02:31.575 --> 02:34.855
[Danny] Right so, if Annie Green
is really Selena Callaway,

02:35.015 --> 02:36.935
then, yeah, we need to check
that out.

02:37.095 --> 02:40.575
It's important. If she was lying,
it might connect her to Jesse.

02:40.735 --> 02:42.215
Yeah, yeah, possibly.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.375
I'd say it was crucial,
wouldn't you?

02:44.535 --> 02:46.415
Mate... I'm gonna get it done.

02:46.575 --> 02:49.735
All right? As soon as I know
anything, you're gonna know it.

02:49.895 --> 02:51.775
- OK. See you.
- All right.

02:51.935 --> 02:53.895
[Danny] Oh, Cal. Cal.

02:54.055 --> 02:56.215
Have you checked that place out yet?

02:56.375 --> 02:57.935
Come on, man. Jay Newman's?

02:58.095 --> 03:01.975
Tried to get a warrant. Apparently,
we haven't got enough evidence.

03:02.135 --> 03:04.295
Whoa. You're going in, though, right?

03:04.455 --> 03:07.735
We'll have another look, as soon as
I've sorted the crap on my desk.

03:07.895 --> 03:09.375
- Sorry. Barry?
- [Liam] Danny?

03:11.895 --> 03:14.135
The age-progression image
of Jesse Wells

03:14.295 --> 03:15.935
and Joe Hanley's custody photo.

03:16.095 --> 03:19.015
- Yeah. I've seen them.
- Well, you two saw him in the flesh.

03:19.175 --> 03:20.775
[Liam] What do you think?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.535
Maybe. Maybe not.

03:23.975 --> 03:25.575
[Liam] Ah, well, that's helpful.

03:25.735 --> 03:28.375
OK. Go to Hanley's place
and get in his face.

03:28.535 --> 03:31.615
If he plays silly buggers,
arrest him. Take some back-up.

03:31.775 --> 03:33.455
Oh, Liam.

03:33.615 --> 03:36.415
There is one other thing.
I want to follow up on a lead.

03:36.575 --> 03:38.055
There's a...

03:38.215 --> 03:39.695
a source...

03:39.855 --> 03:43.535
that thinks that the murdered woman
that we found is not Annie Green.

03:43.695 --> 03:45.695
She's really called Selena Callaway.

03:45.855 --> 03:49.455
- OK. Carry on. I'll get Mickey on it.
- All right. Cheers.

03:49.615 --> 03:51.095
Mickey...

03:51.255 --> 03:52.575
Mickey!

04:05.975 --> 04:08.015
[sighs]

04:14.415 --> 04:16.255
Anything familiar, Brit?

04:19.815 --> 04:21.454
I think it's a left here.

04:21.615 --> 04:23.015
Left?

04:23.175 --> 04:25.135
Left it is.

04:30.255 --> 04:31.815
I don't know what to say.

04:31.975 --> 04:34.735
Well, it's very simple. Just say yes.

04:34.895 --> 04:36.975
A partnership?

04:37.615 --> 04:39.295
Our patients like you very much.

04:39.455 --> 04:42.015
Nothing but praise
with the online feedback.

04:43.375 --> 04:47.415
Well, apart from Mrs Harrison, but
she's a cross we've all had to bear.

04:48.015 --> 04:50.375
It's great. It's... It's amazing.

04:51.575 --> 04:53.455
- I'm shocked.
- [Dr Khan] Well, don't be.

04:53.615 --> 04:55.495
You've been with us two years now?

04:55.655 --> 04:57.495
It's the natural next step.

04:57.655 --> 05:00.375
Have a look at this agreement.
It's pretty standard stuff.

05:00.535 --> 05:03.295
I'm sure you'll want your solicitor
to give it the once-over

05:03.455 --> 05:04.775
before you say yes.

05:04.935 --> 05:06.015
Wow.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.215
Thank you. Thank you, Dr Khan.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.295
That's brilliant news. Thank you.

05:10.455 --> 05:11.975
My pleasure.

05:30.775 --> 05:33.815
[Ally] We'll get more out of him without
that bloody lawyer by his side.

05:33.975 --> 05:37.215
[Danny] Just make sure he doesn't run out.
Check round the back.

[Danny] DS Kenwood.
We're looking for Joe Hanley.

05:57.495 --> 05:58.895
That's me.

06:05.455 --> 06:07.095
Sorry.

06:07.255 --> 06:09.415
Never seen him before in my life.

06:11.895 --> 06:15.775
[Danny] Well, you have to admit, it is
a bit strange that we arrest this guy

06:15.935 --> 06:17.775
and then he gives us your name.

06:17.935 --> 06:19.855
Maybe...

06:20.015 --> 06:22.055
I don't know. He made it up.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.135
It's a common enough surname
around here.

06:25.775 --> 06:27.495
Or maybe I've...

06:28.135 --> 06:30.855
done his accounts
and he just remembered it.

06:31.855 --> 06:35.815
Whatever, there's... obviously been
some kind of mistake.

06:39.335 --> 06:40.375
[Danny] Yeah. Must be.

06:40.975 --> 06:44.255
I mean... you're not the guy
we interviewed.

06:46.495 --> 06:48.015
And you're sure you don't know him?

06:48.175 --> 06:50.895
Sorry. I'm as in the dark
as you are.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.375
All right. Well, thank you.

06:56.695 --> 06:59.695
Oh, actually, before I go,
can I just ask you one more thing?

06:59.855 --> 07:00.895
Sure.

07:02.935 --> 07:05.055
Do you recognise this woman?

07:06.415 --> 07:07.455
Jesus.

07:09.015 --> 07:11.015
She was beaten to death.

07:11.175 --> 07:13.015
A week ago.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.375
She's the...

07:20.055 --> 07:21.375
I know her.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.295
We had sex.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.255
[exhales]

07:30.415 --> 07:32.375
[Joe]
They threatened my family.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.575
I've got a daughter.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.775
I had no choice
but to go along with it.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.095
You could have come to us -
the police.

07:40.255 --> 07:42.095
[Joe]
They had some information on me.

07:43.415 --> 07:46.175
Things have been a bit tricky
in the marriage.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.815
You know how it is.

07:47.975 --> 07:49.855
And somehow they found out.

07:50.015 --> 07:52.255
You were seeing an escort
and they used that

07:52.415 --> 07:54.055
to blackmail you for your identity.

07:54.215 --> 07:57.335
I just thought it was going to be
a credit-card thing. Fraud.

07:57.495 --> 07:59.215
Small time.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.815
- I didn't even know her name.
- Selena Callaway.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.935
[Joe] Selena.

08:06.415 --> 08:07.855
- Right.
- [door opens]

08:08.015 --> 08:09.735
[girl]
Dad! What's going on?

08:12.135 --> 08:15.055
- What happens now?
- We'll be in touch.

08:16.975 --> 08:19.895
- [Ally] Do you believe him?
- [Danny] Yeah. Smells right.

08:20.055 --> 08:22.935
But we should check him out,
make sure he's telling the truth.

08:23.095 --> 08:26.535
Assuming he is the real Joe Hanley,
who the hell did we arrest?

08:35.775 --> 08:36.735
Are we close?

08:37.655 --> 08:40.054
I don't know. It all looks the same.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.695
[Slade] Danny said something
about an upside-down umbrella.

08:44.855 --> 08:46.695
It's got to be around here.

08:57.175 --> 08:58.535

- Run.
- What?

09:01.815 --> 09:04.015
[muffled screams]

09:06.775 --> 09:08.655
You tried to warn her.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.495
- I saw you.
- No, I didn't. I promise.

09:11.655 --> 09:12.575
[scream echoes]

09:20.615 --> 09:22.855
- [breathes heavily]
- Hey.

09:23.735 --> 09:25.335
[Slade] Hey, hey, hey.

09:30.095 --> 09:31.615
[Slade] Is this it?

09:32.295 --> 09:34.335
Is this the one, Brit? Are you sure?

09:36.015 --> 09:37.495
I can't.

09:37.655 --> 09:39.095
I'm sorry.

09:39.255 --> 09:40.335
Hey, Brit.

10:10.535 --> 10:12.535
Hi. Yeah, it's me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.215
Call off the search.
He's just walked back in.

10:15.375 --> 10:18.295
Of course. Of course I'll tell him
how worried you were.

10:18.455 --> 10:20.095
I've been gone for
less than an hour.

10:20.255 --> 10:23.335
The phones have been going crazy.
I've literally been up to here.

10:23.495 --> 10:27.015
I'm really sorry, Larry, but that
top just isn't working for me.

10:27.175 --> 10:28.815
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

10:28.975 --> 10:31.815
Fashion advice from the man
who owns a Homer Simpson tie?

10:31.975 --> 10:34.015
- Hey!
- And wears it.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.615
That tie was a gift from my mum.

10:36.775 --> 10:38.735
One word: car boot sale.

10:40.775 --> 10:42.735
Yeah.
He walked in about an hour ago.

10:42.895 --> 10:45.815
He insists on seeing you.
I told him he needs an appointment,

10:45.975 --> 10:48.695
but, for some reason,
he didn't take me seriously.

10:48.855 --> 10:51.095
Really? Can't believe it.

10:53.575 --> 10:54.895
Hello.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.415
I'm Mark. How can I help you?

10:58.095 --> 11:00.135
My father's gone missing.

11:01.015 --> 11:05.495
[Simon] Before we start, you should know
I have mild Asperger's Syndrome.

11:05.655 --> 11:07.815
I am very comfortable with the label,

11:07.975 --> 11:11.415
it's just that some people
can find me too direct.

11:11.575 --> 11:13.495
Well, I'll bear that in mind.

11:13.655 --> 11:15.655
How did you find me again?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.655
You know my mother.
I assume you did some work for her.

11:18.815 --> 11:20.935
She had one of your business cards
in her handbag.

11:21.095 --> 11:23.135
Your website said "Wells Solicitors",

11:23.295 --> 11:25.615
but also claims
you "find missing people".

11:25.775 --> 11:27.815
Right. We do. Yeah.
Your mother is...?

11:27.975 --> 11:28.975
Laura Marshall.

11:30.735 --> 11:31.895
- <i>You said it was over.</i>
- <i>It was.</i>

11:32.055 --> 11:33.575
[Mark]
<i>So what was Kenton doing here?</i>

11:33.735 --> 11:35.655

with their husband?</i>

11:35.815 --> 11:37.335
I'm Simon Marshall.

11:38.255 --> 11:39.135
[Mark] OK.

11:40.095 --> 11:42.175
I'm still a little bit confused.

11:42.815 --> 11:45.895
If your father is really missing,
how come Laura, your mum...

11:46.055 --> 11:47.735
how come she hasn't gone
to the police?

11:47.895 --> 11:50.855
I don't know. But there is
definitely something wrong.

11:51.015 --> 11:55.055
She says he's away with the school,
some management-training thing.

11:55.215 --> 11:59.015
But I am the one who organises
his school calendar. Not her.

11:59.175 --> 12:00.735
OK. Well...

12:00.895 --> 12:06.375
I still don't quite understand
how this is suspicious.

12:06.535 --> 12:08.215
Well, if his plans changed,

12:08.375 --> 12:10.095
he would have asked me
to update his diary.

12:10.255 --> 12:12.295
So are you like his secretary, then?

12:13.295 --> 12:15.615
I prefer "personal assistant",
thank you very much.

12:15.775 --> 12:18.575
That's very good. Much better.
Personal assistant.

12:18.735 --> 12:22.055
OK. Well... I think I can help,
but I should probably try

12:22.215 --> 12:25.295
and speak to your mum, too, to try
and get to the bottom of this.

12:25.455 --> 12:27.095
I'd rather we both work here.

12:27.255 --> 12:29.655
- OK.
- I find her a massive distraction.

12:29.815 --> 12:32.335
She keeps offering me sandwiches.

12:32.495 --> 12:33.495
Right.

12:33.655 --> 12:35.535
Of course. I understand.

12:35.695 --> 12:40.135
I understand, but I need to try
and gather all the relevant data.

12:40.295 --> 12:44.735
Cause maybe your mum holds some vital
clues that even she is unaware of.

12:44.895 --> 12:46.735
An unknown known?

12:46.895 --> 12:48.095
Exactly.

12:53.455 --> 12:56.575
<i>Deceased adult male found
at 2 Manville Avenue.</i>

12:56.735 --> 12:58.335
<i>Requesting assistance.</i>

12:58.495 --> 13:00.415
You know whose address that is.

13:00.575 --> 13:02.095
[siren wails]

13:06.055 --> 13:09.415
All right. Go out the front.
Keep the punters off the grass.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.655
[Danny] No dogs. Remember?

13:26.975 --> 13:28.975
It bugged me then.

13:29.655 --> 13:31.775
[Danny] Something didn't feel right.

13:35.095 --> 13:37.135
So, what happened here?

13:37.935 --> 13:41.495
[Danny] He gets murdered the day after
we come round? What did we miss?

13:56.135 --> 13:58.175
[taps window]

14:00.535 --> 14:02.095
[dull thud]

14:05.975 --> 14:08.775
[Ally] What are you doing in here,
if the body is in the other room?

14:09.735 --> 14:12.095
Doesn't glass reflect sound?

14:12.775 --> 14:15.295
Why would you put an extra mirror
in here?

14:15.455 --> 14:16.775
I don't know.

14:19.815 --> 14:22.015
[Danny] And a chair facing it.

14:23.615 --> 14:25.615
So you sit here.

14:26.695 --> 14:28.535
You admire your reflection.

14:28.695 --> 14:30.735
A big guy, a big ego.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.135
Oh, my God!

14:51.295 --> 14:53.055
[screaming]

14:57.295 --> 14:59.975
[girls screaming] Help!

15:00.135 --> 15:03.655
OK. Our three girls
are Sasha Manley,

15:03.815 --> 15:06.215
Jane Shilling and Izzy Allan.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.495
They'll interview once the psychologists
have cleared them.

15:09.655 --> 15:11.495
Tomorrow at the earliest.

15:11.655 --> 15:14.535
We know they were chained up,
so who killed this Newman guy?

15:14.695 --> 15:17.055
Have we got any idea how long
they were down there?

15:17.215 --> 15:18.855
One bloody day is a day too long.

15:19.015 --> 15:20.975
And there's nothing on that CCTV?

15:21.135 --> 15:22.975
It's set up to view not record.

15:25.615 --> 15:27.895
I can't believe I walked away
from this.

15:32.855 --> 15:34.815
It smelt wrong and I walked away.

15:34.975 --> 15:37.535
The big picture is
that they're walking free

15:37.695 --> 15:39.455
and the bad guy
has a tag on his toe.

15:39.615 --> 15:41.815
He could be alive and talking
if we'd been quicker.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.535
- We tried to get a warrant.
- You said you were checking it out.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.775
All right. Let's just keep it
professional. All right?

15:50.015 --> 15:51.495
Cal, what do we have?

15:51.655 --> 15:54.095
Here's what we have
from the original files.

15:54.255 --> 15:55.855
The oldest is Jane Shilling.

15:56.015 --> 15:58.535
[Cal] Last seen outside a museum
in Westbridge in 2011.

15:58.695 --> 16:03.095
Wait. That's five years ago. How old
was she when she was abducted?

16:03.255 --> 16:06.815
Nineteen. Her parents reported her
missing. They've been told.

16:06.975 --> 16:08.295
And the others?

16:08.455 --> 16:10.295
Opening up,
but we're taking it slow.

16:10.455 --> 16:12.495
And we're digging up the yard.

16:13.975 --> 16:18.135
Well, it's gonna be a great,
big media shit storm.

16:18.295 --> 16:20.975
So let's keep our heads down
and get on with it.

16:21.135 --> 16:22.975
- Cal?
- I'm on it.

16:24.375 --> 16:28.015
OK, Dempsey and Makepeace,
tell me about the real Joe Hanley.

16:28.175 --> 16:30.695
A chartered accountant
and clean as a whistle.

16:30.855 --> 16:32.775
Other than his escort habit.

16:32.935 --> 16:34.815
Affairs are cheaper. So I've heard.

16:34.975 --> 16:36.455
So what is it? ID theft?

16:36.615 --> 16:38.455
Yeah, with a side order of blackmail.

16:38.615 --> 16:40.935
Keeps him quiet,
while the crooks get busy.

16:41.095 --> 16:42.935
Drain their account, set up new ones.

16:43.095 --> 16:46.135
- Where does Selena Callaway fit in?
- [Danny] Part of the scam.

16:48.655 --> 16:52.455
Maybe she lost her nerve, threatened
to call the police. Paid the price.

16:53.575 --> 16:57.055
OK. Check her place.
See what you can find.

16:57.215 --> 16:59.495
OK. Back to work, people.

17:22.295 --> 17:24.135
You found me.

17:24.295 --> 17:26.575
Helps that you're a creature
of habit, Brit.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.855
I freaked out.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.055
Yeah, I kinda figured that one out.

17:40.855 --> 17:42.895
No one's blaming you.

17:44.895 --> 17:47.055
- Are you sure about that?
- You're a victim.

17:47.215 --> 17:48.735
I helped him.

17:48.895 --> 17:51.335
- No. He did that to you, too.
- No, I helped him.

17:51.495 --> 17:53.535
Ssh, ssh, ssh. Come on.

18:02.055 --> 18:06.295
Well... your chest sounds
clear as a bell, Mrs Harrison.

18:06.895 --> 18:10.335
My infections are invariably
bacterial in nature.

18:10.495 --> 18:12.495
Dr Khan recommends amoxicillin.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.175
If you wish, I can discuss
the case with her.

18:16.335 --> 18:18.215
It's not really as simple as that.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.055
[mobile phone rings]

18:20.215 --> 18:22.015
I'm so sorry about this.
One moment.

18:23.455 --> 18:24.535
Hi.

18:24.695 --> 18:26.175
I really need your help.

18:26.335 --> 18:28.375
I'm in the middle of
seeing a patient.

18:28.535 --> 18:30.895
<i>It's Britnay.
I'm really worried about her.</i>

18:31.055 --> 18:32.735
Now is a really bad time.

18:32.895 --> 18:34.775
I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

18:36.535 --> 18:38.575
Don't make me beg. Pru, please?

18:39.455 --> 18:41.295
My dignity is all I've got left.

18:41.455 --> 18:42.855
[sighs]

18:43.015 --> 18:45.415
OK. I'll see you in the shelter
in 20 minutes.

18:45.575 --> 18:47.055
<i>OK. Thanks.</i>

18:54.015 --> 18:57.055
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come to the door!

18:57.215 --> 18:59.415
Hi, Mum. I need to use the bathroom.

19:03.015 --> 19:05.015
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:13.135 --> 19:15.255
I don't want to talk to you.

19:16.095 --> 19:18.335
That's fine. We'll just...

19:19.415 --> 19:21.055
We'll just sit here.

19:34.495 --> 19:35.975
You're a pretty shit doctor.

19:38.535 --> 19:40.175
I know.

19:40.335 --> 19:45.335
But, luckily, you are the only one
that has ever noticed.

19:46.175 --> 19:48.295
[phone keypad tapping]

20:02.855 --> 20:04.695
I didn't want to go back there.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.815
But he persuaded you. Right?

20:11.455 --> 20:14.815
[Pru] Well, if it's any consolation,
you're not the first.

20:14.975 --> 20:16.895
It was the same when we were kids.

20:17.055 --> 20:18.855
He'd have these big ideas.

20:19.015 --> 20:22.375
Then, when the shit hit the fan,
he'd be nowhere to be seen.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.935
It's not his fault. He just...

20:32.655 --> 20:34.655
He wants to help people and...

20:37.575 --> 20:39.815
some people just can't be helped.

20:40.655 --> 20:42.695
I don't believe that.

20:48.455 --> 20:52.175
Thank you for bringing him home.
He can be a little challenging.

20:52.335 --> 20:56.295
Yeah. Yeah, no, he explained all that.
He was very funny, actually.

20:57.695 --> 20:59.455
Simon doesn't buy
the training course.

21:00.695 --> 21:03.895
God knows why. It's true.
He's probably falling backwards

21:04.055 --> 21:06.175
into a deputy head's arms
right now.

21:06.335 --> 21:08.695
So definitely not abducted
by aliens, then?

21:08.855 --> 21:12.735
Cause I was about to start wearing
my underpants over my trousers.

21:12.895 --> 21:15.255
That won't be necessary. Thank God.

21:16.135 --> 21:18.935
No. We're in contact.
Everything's fine.

21:21.615 --> 21:23.535
Really, we're fine.

21:23.695 --> 21:26.455
Right, I'd better get back to work.

21:27.735 --> 21:29.415
Thanks for this.

21:29.575 --> 21:31.535
It's all part of the ex-lover
service.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.455
It's really good to see you.

21:40.895 --> 21:43.415
Simon needs a father.
He needs his routine.

21:43.575 --> 21:46.615
Everything has to be
simple and straightforward.

21:46.775 --> 21:49.095
- Efficient.
- Otherwise, he can't cope.

21:49.255 --> 21:50.855
And then none of us can.

21:51.015 --> 21:53.775
Thanks for the coffee.
I'm gonna head off.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.015
Mark!

22:00.215 --> 22:02.295
- Hey, Slade.
- Yeah?

22:03.375 --> 22:06.975
I can't believe you took her back
to that place. What happened?

22:07.135 --> 22:10.255
I was trying to see if she remembered
something if we went back there.

22:10.415 --> 22:12.495
Well, you were right about that.

22:12.655 --> 22:15.375
Look, she...
hides it well, but...

22:16.375 --> 22:18.255
she'd follow you anywhere.

22:18.415 --> 22:20.575
I have that effect
on a lot of people, Pru.

22:20.735 --> 22:22.615
I think it's my aftershave.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.775
I should get back.

22:25.855 --> 22:27.095
Listen...

22:27.255 --> 22:29.535
Maybe we should make this
a regular thing.

22:29.695 --> 22:31.775
It's good to have a doctor
in the house.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.815
- You want me to work here?
- No, no, no.

22:33.975 --> 22:36.255
It would strictly be
on a volunteer basis.

22:36.415 --> 22:37.855
Why would I do that?

22:38.015 --> 22:40.175
Well, today, you abandoned
your private clinic

22:40.335 --> 22:42.175
and drove halfway across the city.

22:42.335 --> 22:44.455
Was that just because
I asked you to?

22:44.615 --> 22:46.455
Maybe I'm just a sucker.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.975
Or maybe... you see people
that deserve your help.

22:52.055 --> 22:53.495
You are so simple.

22:53.655 --> 22:54.895
- I think so.
- Bye, Slade.

22:57.495 --> 22:59.575
[landlord] I saw it on the news,
but I didn't realise

22:59.735 --> 23:02.015
Selena was the woman found dead
in that hotel.

23:02.575 --> 23:03.935
Thank you.

23:04.095 --> 23:06.695
Shouldn't we wait for
the crime-scene manager?

23:06.855 --> 23:08.975
I'm wearing my Marigolds, aren't I?

23:13.015 --> 23:14.895
[Ally] Mmm.

23:15.055 --> 23:17.055
- Hello.
- Cats are evil.

23:22.535 --> 23:24.215
Danny...

23:24.375 --> 23:26.255
meet Skittles.

23:27.095 --> 23:28.415
Pure evil.

23:42.375 --> 23:44.255
[|Ally]
I wonder who's been feeding him.

23:44.415 --> 23:48.295
[Danny] If you could just focus on trying
to find clues, that'd be great. Thanks.

23:48.455 --> 23:49.935
[Ally] It's a nice place.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.695
She worked as an IT consultant
for Porter & Starr,

23:52.855 --> 23:56.575
so maybe there's something on
a laptop or a tablet or something.

24:02.055 --> 24:03.535
A daughter?

24:03.695 --> 24:05.695
Yeah. Looks like it.

24:06.775 --> 24:09.455
At least we've got
the right person this time.

24:10.375 --> 24:12.375
I'm going to check the bedrooms.

24:44.015 --> 24:45.695
Uhh! Uhh...

24:45.855 --> 24:47.575
[coughs] Ally!

24:54.255 --> 24:56.255
[Ally] I'm calling it in!

25:04.575 --> 25:06.335
[siren wails]

25:14.215 --> 25:16.455
Police! Police! Move! Move!
Out of the way!

25:17.895 --> 25:18.975
Police! Move!

25:28.735 --> 25:29.975
Move! Out of the way!

25:32.215 --> 25:33.815
Stop! Police!

25:35.295 --> 25:36.855
[Danny]
Stop him! Police!

25:40.295 --> 25:41.415
[Danny] Stop him!

25:43.215 --> 25:45.375
[crowd gasps]

25:45.935 --> 25:47.655
Whoa!

25:47.815 --> 25:51.055
What are you doing?
I said stop him, not kill him.

25:57.415 --> 25:59.215
Someone call an ambulance!

26:12.375 --> 26:14.135
[monitor beeps]

26:21.815 --> 26:23.855
- [Ally] Do you think he's Jesse?
- I don't know.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.375
Hey, doc! Doctor?

26:25.535 --> 26:26.615
Can I...?

26:28.135 --> 26:29.575
So...

26:29.735 --> 26:33.055
Was there anything from that scan
that you were talking about?

26:33.215 --> 26:36.095
There's no bleed, but the cerebral
contusion is significant.

26:36.255 --> 26:38.695
We'll be keeping him asleep
for the time being,

26:38.855 --> 26:40.775
monitoring intracerebral pressure.

26:40.935 --> 26:43.135
Sorry...
And then he'll wake up?

26:43.295 --> 26:44.455
Perhaps.

26:44.615 --> 26:47.815
[doctor] Once the sedation is lifted,
all outcomes are possible.

26:47.975 --> 26:49.815
Do you have any identification?

26:50.815 --> 26:53.815
Because if this man has any family,
they need to be informed.

26:53.975 --> 26:55.615
If we end up having
to switch him off,

26:55.775 --> 26:57.535
it helps to have
asked permission first.

27:01.775 --> 27:03.695
And you think it could be him?

27:03.855 --> 27:07.375
I don't know. We've sent the DNA.
We're getting it fast-tracked.

27:07.535 --> 27:11.175
It's definitely the guy we interviewed.
It's just through here.

27:13.135 --> 27:16.135
Just give me a minute. All right?
Go on, mate.

27:36.335 --> 27:37.335
Mark!

27:45.455 --> 27:46.975
I don't know.

27:55.095 --> 27:58.335
I thought, you know...
either way...

27:58.495 --> 28:00.935
- I'm really sorry.
- It's been a long time.

28:03.255 --> 28:05.495
[Mark]
I'm sorry. I just don't know.

28:05.655 --> 28:07.295
Christ.

28:07.455 --> 28:09.095
What did the doctor say?

28:14.295 --> 28:17.015
That's why you called me.
He's gonna die, isn't he?

28:17.175 --> 28:19.015
They asked about family.

28:19.855 --> 28:21.855
[Mark] My parents should see him.

28:22.015 --> 28:24.095
Look, I don't think that's
a great idea. Not yet.

28:24.255 --> 28:27.735
Their son is dying in a hospital bed.
They've got a right to know.

28:27.895 --> 28:30.815
I can't OK that. All right? You're
not even supposed to be in here.

28:30.975 --> 28:34.615
If you're not 100 per cent sure,
let's just wait for the DNA result.

28:34.775 --> 28:37.495
- Special privileges, then?
- Sorry about that.

28:37.655 --> 28:40.335
[Danny] I just wanted him to have a look.
It's fine.

28:41.375 --> 28:45.015
- And the girls from the Newman place?
- Still with the psychologists.

28:45.175 --> 28:48.735
Gonna be at least another 24 hours
before we can even speak to them.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.695
Did we get anything from
Selena Callaway's laptop?

28:51.855 --> 28:54.135
Freshly spring-cleaned
by our intruder.

28:54.295 --> 28:56.975
- Why not just destroy it?
- What's more suspicious?

28:57.135 --> 29:00.935
A missing laptop or one filled with
cat pictures and Facebook updates?

29:01.095 --> 29:04.575
Which means there was something worth
finding and now it's gone.

29:04.735 --> 29:06.615
So we're back to where we started.

29:06.775 --> 29:08.255
You're a man.

29:08.415 --> 29:10.295
Do you back up your computer?

29:10.455 --> 29:12.455
Sometimes. Maybe.

29:13.535 --> 29:15.615
- No.
- Well, I do.

29:15.775 --> 29:17.175
Every day.

29:28.735 --> 29:32.175
I'm not sure I can do this.
Is it him? Just tell me.

29:32.335 --> 29:35.335
Mum, I don't know. I'm sorry.

29:37.735 --> 29:39.375
I don't want to.

29:39.535 --> 29:42.135
We've come this far,
we can do this together. Come on.

29:42.295 --> 29:44.575
- What if it's him?
- Then we'll know.

29:44.735 --> 29:46.095
Both of us.

29:53.255 --> 29:55.095
- OK?
- OK.

29:55.975 --> 29:57.295
[sighs]

30:32.735 --> 30:34.375
Mum?

30:39.015 --> 30:40.895
He's someone's son.

30:41.055 --> 30:42.895
But not mine.

30:46.935 --> 30:48.375
You're sure?

30:49.775 --> 30:51.615
This isn't Jesse.

30:55.815 --> 30:57.655
Let's get out of here.

31:04.815 --> 31:08.095
You were right.
A bespoke cloud back-up system.

31:08.255 --> 31:10.055
A server on the dark web.

31:10.215 --> 31:12.895
I knew she'd come in useful someday.

31:13.055 --> 31:15.415
[woman] This means all her files
are saved remotely.

31:15.575 --> 31:18.535
- We just have to access them.
- If we just had her password.

31:18.695 --> 31:20.495
[woman]
Shouldn't be too hard to overwrite.

31:20.655 --> 31:23.015
[types]

31:23.175 --> 31:25.495
We won't know for sure
until we get the DNA.

31:25.655 --> 31:27.335
- She'd know, believe me.
- OK. Even so...

31:27.495 --> 31:28.655
Do you think there's a day

31:28.815 --> 31:30.855
when she hasn't imagined
what he looks like now?

31:31.015 --> 31:34.335
She'd know Jesse the same way she'd
know you. The same way as I would.

31:36.255 --> 31:40.455
When you have children, you'll
understand. I'm taking her home.

31:43.975 --> 31:46.615
[Alan] I shouldn't have let him
persuade me. I'm sorry.

31:46.775 --> 31:49.495
He has hope, Alan. And so do I.

31:49.655 --> 31:52.455
Maybe it's time you let
some hope back in. Hm?

31:57.735 --> 31:59.055
And we're in.

31:59.215 --> 32:01.775
[Ally]
It's all names on individual files.

32:01.935 --> 32:03.895
Do you recognise anything?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.055
There. Joseph Michael Hanley.

32:07.215 --> 32:09.375
God, there are so many names.

32:09.535 --> 32:11.335
[Ally] This was a huge operation.

32:11.495 --> 32:13.215
What's that clock thing do?

32:13.375 --> 32:16.335
[woman] It looks like
an automatic delete setting.

32:16.495 --> 32:18.135
- Do something.
- Any ideas?

32:18.295 --> 32:20.815
[rapid bleeping]

32:20.975 --> 32:22.935
I can't stop it.

32:28.135 --> 32:29.335
Watch out.

32:39.335 --> 32:40.855
[Stuart] Cheers.

32:42.255 --> 32:44.095
I still have to approve
the contract.

32:44.255 --> 32:45.535
They love you.

32:47.095 --> 32:49.655
Obviously, like me,
they have excellent taste.

32:49.815 --> 32:52.175
[TV volume on low]

32:54.335 --> 32:57.495
You know, this move,
the whole home-coming thing,

32:57.655 --> 32:59.735
I thought it was a mistake.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.735
Move on. Never look back.

33:01.895 --> 33:02.975
Shark philosophy.

33:04.375 --> 33:05.775
But this?

33:06.935 --> 33:08.975
This is the real thing.

33:09.815 --> 33:11.975
You keep this up and I can retire.

33:12.495 --> 33:15.135
I always wanted to be
a house husband.

33:17.095 --> 33:19.935
<i>The police have not made
any official statement,</i>

33:20.095 --> 33:23.375
<i>but first reports suggest the kidnappings
could be on a scale</i>

33:23.535 --> 33:26.535
<i>with notorious cases in Austria
and the United States.</i>

33:26.695 --> 33:30.015
<i>There are unconfirmed reports
of a man's body being removed</i>

33:30.175 --> 33:33.055
<i>from the record producer
Jay Newman's home.</i>

33:36.855 --> 33:38.415
[Karl] Hey, Ally.

33:38.575 --> 33:40.735
Do you want to see something weird?

33:40.895 --> 33:43.215
If it's on your phone
and it involves sex,

33:43.375 --> 33:45.255
cars or extreme weather, then no.

33:45.415 --> 33:48.255
Ouch, Ally.
It's actually way better than that.

33:49.135 --> 33:52.655
Ken told me to give you this result.
Priority One. Fast-tracked.

33:52.815 --> 33:55.055
Guess whose DNA was found
at the Newman scene?

33:55.215 --> 33:57.735
A microscopic blood splatter
on the shirt.

33:58.415 --> 34:00.295
- Jesse Wells.
- Bingo.

34:08.574 --> 34:11.975
Finding Jesse's DNA at one crime
scene could be contamination.

34:12.135 --> 34:13.495
But two?

34:13.655 --> 34:16.975
Yeah, but why Jay Newman?
He's got zero connection to Hanley.

34:17.135 --> 34:18.775
[Ally]
Unless we're missing something.

34:18.935 --> 34:22.574
This time, we've got blood on
the shirt. Direct contact. A fight?

34:22.735 --> 34:25.735
- Meaning Jesse killed him?
- But why?

34:25.895 --> 34:27.255
Right now...

34:27.415 --> 34:29.935
a zombie vigilante makes
the most sense.

34:30.094 --> 34:31.415
[text alert]

34:33.495 --> 34:36.215
Oh, shit. I'd forgotten
I'm supposed to meet Mark.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.335
Here. Wait. You're not going
to tell him, are you?

34:40.735 --> 34:42.735
No. Of course not.

34:43.855 --> 34:45.775
[Danny]
What the hell is this place?

34:45.935 --> 34:48.815
It's on trend, hip, cool.

34:48.975 --> 34:51.175
All words you may recognise.

34:52.054 --> 34:53.335
Uh-huh.

34:53.495 --> 34:56.895
And this is what a £12.99
Bundy Burger looks like, is it?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.535
Yeah.

34:58.695 --> 35:00.135
Well, it's on you.

35:00.295 --> 35:03.215
Let's face it, you owe me after
that little stunt at the hospital.

35:03.375 --> 35:04.855
Your mum was sure. Yeah?

35:05.015 --> 35:07.055
Not him. 100 per cent.

35:07.215 --> 35:09.935
I suppose you've already
sent off the DNA.

35:10.095 --> 35:11.735
- [mobile phone buzzes]
- Yeah.

35:16.415 --> 35:19.135
- Take it, if you want.
- No, it's OK. It's a client.

35:21.975 --> 35:23.895
Actually, it's Laura's son.

35:24.055 --> 35:26.775
- He thinks his dad's gone missing.
- Mm-hm?

35:26.935 --> 35:28.855
I know they're having troubles.

35:29.015 --> 35:30.655
Just reading between the lines.

35:30.815 --> 35:32.815
Not that that's any interest to you.

35:36.295 --> 35:38.615
That's a leading question.
No comment.

35:42.335 --> 35:44.215
Oh. Organic ketchup.

35:44.375 --> 35:45.815
Of course.

35:45.975 --> 35:48.215
Even the condiments have beards!

35:50.575 --> 35:52.935
What's wrong with eating
at your dad's place?

35:53.095 --> 35:56.535
[sighs] Mate, he doesn't think we
should even be looking for Jesse.

35:58.255 --> 36:01.335
Your son's DNA turns up
after 20 years.

36:01.495 --> 36:03.375
Got to be a hard thing
to get your head around.

36:03.535 --> 36:06.895
Whether you agree with it or not,
you've got to respect that.

36:08.255 --> 36:09.895
[laughter]

36:10.055 --> 36:11.815
Oh, good job, man.

36:13.015 --> 36:14.855
[mobile phone buzzes]

36:17.375 --> 36:19.215
Oh, it's Pru.

36:19.375 --> 36:22.015
Yeah, look, I should probably
get going myself.

36:22.175 --> 36:24.135
I need to check up
on our mystery man.

36:24.295 --> 36:25.895
Say hi to Pru.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.455
[Mark] Pru.

36:28.615 --> 36:30.775
You want to get some Heinz, mate.

36:38.535 --> 36:39.655
[Ally] Fuck.

36:39.815 --> 36:41.695
Yeah. All right. Thanks.

36:41.855 --> 36:44.535
Danny, the confirmation
has just come through.

36:44.695 --> 36:47.655
Our mystery man's DNA doesn't match
that of Jesse Wells

36:47.815 --> 36:50.375
and it's not on the database,
either.

36:50.535 --> 36:51.415
Great.

36:51.575 --> 36:53.855
- So who have we got in there?
- I don't know.

36:54.855 --> 36:56.095
Shit.

36:56.255 --> 36:59.135
[monitor beeps]

37:00.415 --> 37:03.455
Hanley's a dead end. Selena's given
us three names and a screen grab.

37:03.615 --> 37:06.215
There's the girls from Newman's
place when they're ready to talk.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.215
- Maybe one of them killed him.
- Yeah, but why now?

37:09.375 --> 37:10.975
It's too much of a coincidence.

37:11.135 --> 37:13.975
- Jesse's DNA is at that murder scene.
- What does that mean?

37:14.135 --> 37:15.935
Has he got a connection with Newman?

37:23.815 --> 37:29.455
What if Jesse's abducted, he escapes,
he comes back to finish off the job?

37:34.815 --> 37:36.655
This must be tough on you.

37:45.975 --> 37:47.895
Is this guy even able
to speak to us?

37:48.055 --> 37:51.415
Yeah. The doctors said he's recovered
some since lifting the sedation.

37:54.895 --> 37:56.815
Maybe I'll just ask him who he is.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.255
- Nicely.
- Yeah, of course.

38:06.095 --> 38:10.975
[Pru] God, Mark, being back in this place,
it's... I don't know.

38:11.135 --> 38:12.975
[Mark]
I go running here every day.

38:13.135 --> 38:15.495
- Really?
- Every day.

38:15.655 --> 38:18.375
I still look for him.
It's weird, isn't it?

38:18.535 --> 38:21.535
Even though my brain is telling me
that it can't be true,

38:21.695 --> 38:24.455
a part of me just still looks.

38:26.215 --> 38:29.095
The head knows, but the heart
won't get the message.

38:29.255 --> 38:32.855
I never understood before,
that desire,

38:33.015 --> 38:35.335
that need to have a body.

38:35.495 --> 38:37.695
But it's true. You know, you need...

38:38.335 --> 38:40.615
You need to know,
one way or another.

38:44.215 --> 38:46.775
So, the clinic just offered me
a partnership.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.535
Congratulations.

38:51.695 --> 38:55.375
And, today, I ducked out
to help Slade. One of the kids.

38:55.535 --> 38:58.735
And now he wants me to work
at the shelter, like a team medic.

38:58.895 --> 39:00.775
- Right.
- An unqualified shrink.

39:00.935 --> 39:02.855
Well, he thinks I need help.
Morally.

39:03.015 --> 39:04.615
[laughs]

39:04.775 --> 39:08.815
You'd better pack your bags,
cause you are going on a guilt trip.

39:08.975 --> 39:11.415
I'm telling you,
he gets everyone in the end.

39:11.575 --> 39:14.055
- Do you think it's dumb?
- It's a really good idea.

39:15.255 --> 39:17.895
Never take career advice
from a bleeding heart.

39:18.055 --> 39:19.535
[wry laugh]

39:19.695 --> 39:22.175
Do you ever wonder about
the choices you make?

39:22.335 --> 39:24.215
The ones that screw everything up?

39:24.375 --> 39:27.215
Well, "self-destruction" is
my middle name.

39:27.375 --> 39:29.655
I just can't fit it
into my business cards!

39:29.815 --> 39:30.655
[Pru laughs]

39:30.815 --> 39:32.855
- Oh, look.
- God, you remember?

39:33.815 --> 39:36.295
- Remember when it was like that?
- Yeah.

39:36.455 --> 39:38.495
Four kids versus
the rest of the world.

39:38.655 --> 39:41.015
Everything was so simple, wasn't it?

39:42.015 --> 39:44.535
[Mark] You're either with us
or you're against us.

39:44.695 --> 39:48.215
The band. Do you remember the band?
Oh, my God, what was it called?

39:48.375 --> 39:51.135
- The one we were gonna form.
- Synthetic Execution.

39:51.295 --> 39:52.535
Right?

39:52.695 --> 39:54.215
[laughs]

39:54.375 --> 39:56.575
Oh, shit, what happened to the band?

39:57.135 --> 40:00.335
Well, whatever happens
to everyone's bands. Right?

40:00.495 --> 40:01.615
Life.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.575
Or the singer keeps on insisting
on playing bloody bass.

40:05.735 --> 40:06.935
Bullshit.

40:07.095 --> 40:08.975
Slade kept quitting, remember?

40:09.135 --> 40:12.455
There was something about musical
differences. I don't know.

40:12.615 --> 40:15.615
We were clearly witnessing
the birth of a human enigma.

40:15.775 --> 40:19.055
- That's what was happening.
- Or he was doing it for attention.

40:19.215 --> 40:21.695
Hey. Maybe he deserves it.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.935
Always on his side.

40:26.095 --> 40:28.335
It's the eternal bromance.

40:47.375 --> 40:49.615
[children's laughter echoes]

40:53.935 --> 40:55.775
Do you trust him?

40:55.935 --> 40:57.575
Slade.

40:59.375 --> 41:01.215
Yeah, I trust him with my life. Why?

41:09.495 --> 41:11.335
- Pru?
- No, it's nothing.

41:11.495 --> 41:14.495
[Mark] Well, no, it clearly is something.
What is it?

41:15.375 --> 41:16.535
Pru?

41:18.535 --> 41:20.535
Can you tell me, please?

41:25.815 --> 41:27.455
That day...

41:28.535 --> 41:32.535
that we lost Jesse,
we didn't tell you the truth.

41:33.575 --> 41:35.615
Well, not all of it.

41:37.535 --> 41:39.015
[sighs]

41:39.175 --> 41:41.015
Slade and I were here.

41:42.815 --> 41:46.735
We were on our own,
so no one could see us.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.935
I remember you said
you'd gone to the shops.

41:49.095 --> 41:50.015
No, Mark.

41:50.175 --> 41:53.535
[Pru] <i>We were... together.</i>

41:54.575 --> 41:57.095
We were trying to work out
a way of telling you.

41:57.255 --> 41:59.095
Pru, is that it?

41:59.255 --> 42:00.775
Oh, God.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.575
Whatever. We were kids.
It's a long time ago.

42:03.735 --> 42:05.575
Mark.

42:17.175 --> 42:18.295
We saw him.

42:19.575 --> 42:24.815
After he'd gone off...
Slade and I saw Jesse.

42:24.975 --> 42:27.055
[Pru]
<i>We thought he was spying on us.</i>

42:27.215 --> 42:29.575
Jesse? Jesse, come here!

42:30.695 --> 42:33.775
[Pru] <i>So Slade chased him, because
he didn't want him to tell you.</i>

42:34.895 --> 42:38.495
I don't understand what you're
saying, why you haven't told me.

42:39.815 --> 42:41.495
- [Pru] <i>We were scared.</i>
- Jesse!

42:42.575 --> 42:45.375
Slade didn't want you to find out
about us. He was your best friend.

42:45.535 --> 42:47.175
- What are we gonna do?
- We tell no one.

42:47.335 --> 42:48.615
But you both saw Jesse.

42:48.775 --> 42:49.695
[young Slade] Jesse!

42:49.855 --> 42:52.055
You both saw Jesse
before the last sighting.

42:52.215 --> 42:54.455
What if the witnesses
didn't see him with Marosi?

42:54.615 --> 42:56.935
Do you really think
that could have happened?

42:57.095 --> 43:00.415
I don't know, Pru. But what if
his confessions were all lies?

43:00.575 --> 43:02.575
That changes everything, doesn't it?

43:02.735 --> 43:05.855
That means that Jesse could have
gone south, not west.

43:06.015 --> 43:08.695
That... That means that our timeline
is all wrong.

43:08.855 --> 43:12.335
We'd already lied to the police.
Marosi had done his confession.

43:12.495 --> 43:15.215
- Would it have changed anything?
- You should have told me!

43:15.375 --> 43:18.615
No, I know and I'm so sorry, Mark.
I'm so sorry.

43:29.415 --> 43:32.055
Who else is lying about that day,
Mark?
