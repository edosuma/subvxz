00:01.534 --> 00:04.051
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.487
And I look up and I say,

00:05.554 --> 00:07.922
"It will never do,
it will never do."

00:07.990 --> 00:09.524
I just cannot believe...

00:09.592 --> 00:10.942
Normie.
Huh?

00:11.009 --> 00:13.311
Normie, it's the Kennedys.

00:13.312 --> 00:15.096
Let's go tell the
guys downstairs. No, no, no,

00:15.097 --> 00:16.164
I've got a camera with me.

00:16.165 --> 00:17.332
Here, quick, get a snapshot.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.433
I'll... I'll pretend
I'm with them.

00:18.434 --> 00:19.824
I'll be nonchalant, okay?

00:24.891 --> 00:26.641
Oh, would you guys
like a picture?

00:26.642 --> 00:28.109
Oh, that would be great-
do you mind?

00:28.110 --> 00:29.527
No, no.
You sure you don't mind?

00:29.528 --> 00:30.595
Great, thank you.

00:30.662 --> 00:31.712
Thank you.
Okay.

00:31.730 --> 00:33.364
(chuckling)

00:33.808 --> 00:35.734
That's great.
All right.

00:35.735 --> 00:36.785
Thank you so much.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.019
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.590
Nice to see you.
Nice to meet you.

00:39.655 --> 00:40.705
Bye.
Yeah.

00:40.756 --> 00:41.806
Bye-bye.
All right!

00:41.858 --> 00:43.024

Hey, Cliffie.

02:03.688 --> 02:04.989
Hey.
What you doing?

02:05.057 --> 02:06.987
I'm, uh, writing
a little letter here

02:06.988 --> 02:08.692
to that Russian cosmonaut
who's stranded

02:08.693 --> 02:10.627
in the space station up there.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.430
How are you gonna get it to him?

02:17.386 --> 02:19.087
(phone ringing)
WOODY: Cheers.

02:19.155 --> 02:21.522
Hi, honey.

02:21.590 --> 02:23.692
Oh, now, let's not
go through this again.

02:23.693 --> 02:25.293
I thought we already
had it decided.

02:25.294 --> 02:27.495
We're gonna stay
in my apartment.

02:27.496 --> 02:29.497
Well, how do you know
you don't like it?

02:29.498 --> 02:31.399
You haven't seen it yet.

02:31.466 --> 02:34.903
Trust me, Kelly, you're gonna
come to love Chinatown.

02:34.963 --> 02:37.371
Now... now,
don't forget,

02:37.372 --> 02:39.907
our place is the one
right next to the shop

02:39.975 --> 02:43.478
with the beheaded ducks
draining in the window.

02:43.546 --> 02:45.313
Well, I love you, too.

02:45.381 --> 02:46.481
Bye-bye.

02:46.549 --> 02:48.082
(smacks lips)

02:48.150 --> 02:49.851
What was that all about?

02:49.919 --> 02:52.187
Well, uh, since our
wedding, Kelly and I

02:52.255 --> 02:54.845
have been living in one of
the Gaines' guest houses.

02:54.857 --> 02:56.858
Now she wants to get
a house of our own,

02:56.926 --> 02:59.361
but I can't afford
it, so I think

02:59.362 --> 03:01.263
we should just live
in my old apartment.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.997
You kept your apartment
the whole time?

03:02.998 --> 03:03.982
Well, I kind of had to.

03:03.983 --> 03:06.484
I have a
ten-year lease.

03:08.170 --> 03:10.605
How did you get stuck
with a ten-year lease?

03:10.672 --> 03:13.324
I had to do some
pretty fancy talking.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.744
I save ten bucks a month.

03:16.812 --> 03:18.846
That's money in my pocket.

03:18.847 --> 03:19.931
Let me ask you something.

03:19.932 --> 03:21.433
You-you think Kelly's
gonna be happy

03:21.434 --> 03:22.734
in that little place of yours?

03:22.735 --> 03:24.986
Well, what does it matter?

03:25.054 --> 03:27.822
I'm the husband-
I call the shots.

03:27.890 --> 03:30.458
Isn't that rather
sexist, Woody?

03:30.459 --> 03:31.826
Well you've got to understand.

03:31.827 --> 03:33.094
That's how I was brought up.

03:33.095 --> 03:34.462
Back in Hanover,

03:34.529 --> 03:37.065
the man is the king
of the castle.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.366
When he gives an order,

03:38.434 --> 03:41.336
all his wives have to listen.

03:41.404 --> 03:44.005
Wives, Woody?

03:44.073 --> 03:45.123
Wife.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.242
I said wife-
singular.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.111
(laughing):
I mean, the thought that a man

03:50.179 --> 03:53.013
could have more than one wife,
that's preposterous.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.097
I mean, I...
not to mention illegal.

03:56.118 --> 03:57.485
I know that.

03:57.553 --> 04:01.122
So do all the citizens
of Hanover.

04:04.343 --> 04:06.561
Anybody else curious
about Hanover?

04:06.629 --> 04:08.379
Come on, Norm,
I'm sure it's just a...

04:08.381 --> 04:11.549
a normal, rural, small,
little farm town.

04:11.617 --> 04:14.785
I'm sure Woody's stories
are all greatly exaggerated.

04:14.853 --> 04:16.070
Want to go there?

04:16.137 --> 04:18.608
What, end up as a
human sacrifice to the corn god?

04:18.656 --> 04:20.158
Thank you, no.

04:24.496 --> 04:28.183
Ooh, nobody told me
the fleet was in.

04:30.920 --> 04:33.487
So... what can
I get you,

04:33.555 --> 04:36.024
you silver-haired
boy toy?

04:39.728 --> 04:41.830
I'm looking for Rebecca Howe.

04:41.897 --> 04:43.865
Why do you want hamburger

04:43.933 --> 04:45.666
when you can have fillet mignon?

04:49.455 --> 04:51.071
She's my daughter.

04:52.024 --> 04:53.508
Ooh.

04:57.028 --> 04:58.412
Excuse me, uh...

04:58.900 --> 05:00.982
Hi there, I'm sorry.

05:00.983 --> 05:02.249
Uh, did I hear you right,

05:02.250 --> 05:03.485
that you're
Rebecca Howe's father?

05:03.486 --> 05:04.652
That's right.

05:04.653 --> 05:06.855
Captain Franklin E. Howe,
United States Navy.

05:06.856 --> 05:08.289
Oh, I'm Sam Malone.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.108
You know, maybe
she mentioned me to you.

05:10.109 --> 05:11.979
Yes, you're the
bright young fellow

05:11.980 --> 05:13.961
who tried to have a
baby with my daughter

05:13.962 --> 05:15.830
without the sanctity
of wedlock.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.167
So, my name came up then.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.468
I have just one
question for you.

05:21.536 --> 05:24.438
What the hell were
you thinking, boy?

05:24.506 --> 05:27.008
What the hell were
you thinking?

05:27.076 --> 05:30.745
Um, well, we
were both thinking, sir,

05:30.746 --> 05:32.947
that, you know, because
we're such good friends...

05:32.948 --> 05:34.749
we weren't in love,
yes, that's true,

05:34.750 --> 05:36.884
but we thought maybe
we could be a, you know,

05:36.885 --> 05:38.420
mommy and a daddy
without the commitment

05:38.421 --> 05:40.188
and the other stuff.
I know...

05:40.189 --> 05:42.173
I know saying this right now
sounds kind of...

05:42.174 --> 05:43.708
even to me, it sounds...

05:43.775 --> 05:45.910
Is it hot in here
or is it just me?

05:48.680 --> 05:50.114
Daddy.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.567
Daddy, what are you doing here?

05:52.634 --> 05:55.269
I just wanted to see
my little Pookie. Oh!

05:55.337 --> 05:57.054
(Rebecca giggling)

05:57.055 --> 05:59.040
Everybody, I want you
to meet my father.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.025
You can just call him Brig-
that's his nickname.

06:01.026 --> 06:02.076
They call him Brig

06:02.110 --> 06:04.345
because he put
so many sailors in jail.

06:04.413 --> 06:06.314
Then, why don't
they call me Brig?

06:08.683 --> 06:11.152
Daddy, over here.

06:11.219 --> 06:14.022
Daddy, I'm so surprised
to see you.

06:14.089 --> 06:15.757
Is anything wrong?

06:15.758 --> 06:17.525
Well, to tell you
the truth, Pookie,

06:17.526 --> 06:19.193
your mother and I
became a little concerned

06:19.194 --> 06:20.895
when we received
your last postcard.

06:20.896 --> 06:22.580
Well, why?
It said,

06:22.648 --> 06:24.082
"Having a wonderful time.

06:24.149 --> 06:25.816
Wish I were dead."

06:25.884 --> 06:28.602
Daddy, why don't you
just sit here, and I'll get us

06:28.670 --> 06:30.788
a couple of beers or something.

06:30.789 --> 06:32.957
Everybody, psst, psst,
come here, come here.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.959
Listen, I need your help.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.961
Listen, my... my dad
can be kind of critical,

06:36.962 --> 06:40.198
so let's not go into some
of the dumber things

06:40.199 --> 06:41.899
that I've done while
I've worked here.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.202
Well, what are we gonna
talk to him about?

06:45.220 --> 06:46.337
I don't know.

06:46.338 --> 06:47.738
You could talk to
him about anything.

06:47.739 --> 06:48.772
Talk to him about the weather.

06:48.773 --> 06:50.507
Just... my dad
sort of thinks

06:50.575 --> 06:52.109
that I'm some sort of screw up.

06:52.177 --> 06:54.261
ALL:
No!

06:54.329 --> 06:56.230
Very funny.

06:56.298 --> 06:59.033
It all started when my dad
took me as a little girl

06:59.101 --> 07:02.036
on a tour of his aircraft
carrier, and I...

07:02.104 --> 07:04.272
well, to make a long
story short, I...

07:04.340 --> 07:06.841
I shot something off the boat.

07:08.243 --> 07:11.462
One international incident,
and I am branded for life.

07:11.463 --> 07:14.215
Anyway, I just...
it's just very important

07:14.216 --> 07:16.083
that he thinks that I know
what I'm doing,

07:16.084 --> 07:17.618
so let... let's not
bring things up

07:17.619 --> 07:19.237
like losing the liquor license

07:19.238 --> 07:20.304
or, uh... or
the flood.

07:20.372 --> 07:22.840
And God forbid, do
not mention the fire.

07:24.793 --> 07:26.561
She lost the liquor license,

07:26.629 --> 07:28.863
and then she flooded the place?

07:30.765 --> 07:32.116
That's not the capper.

07:32.183 --> 07:34.173
(chuckling):
Then, she burned it down.

07:37.522 --> 07:39.724
Oh, Pookie.

07:39.791 --> 07:41.659
You burned down the bar.

07:41.727 --> 07:44.629
I know, I was gonna tell you,
but I thought you'd be mad.

07:44.697 --> 07:45.930
I see.

07:45.997 --> 07:49.133
It's the playroom incident
all over again.

07:49.201 --> 07:51.502
Pookie, I'm very
concerned about you.

07:51.570 --> 07:53.087
I mean, let's review.

07:53.155 --> 07:55.623
Oh, no, Daddy,
let's not review.

07:55.690 --> 07:56.891
In the past year,

07:56.958 --> 07:58.209
you tried to have a baby

07:58.277 --> 08:00.711
with a man
you weren't married to,

08:00.712 --> 08:02.330
you burned down
your place of business,

08:02.331 --> 08:04.832
and now, according
to your last letter,

08:04.900 --> 08:08.869
you want another raise
in your allowance.

08:10.639 --> 08:12.773
Uh, excuse me,
did you just say,

08:12.841 --> 08:14.441
"a raise in her allowance"?

08:14.442 --> 08:16.243
No, he did not say,
"raise in allowance".

08:16.244 --> 08:17.294
He said...

08:18.630 --> 08:21.632
"That old, lazy Jack Palance."

08:21.700 --> 08:23.117
Daddy,

08:23.185 --> 08:24.952
what say we go have some lunch?

08:24.953 --> 08:25.737
Come on.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.054
Let's talk about the family.

08:27.055 --> 08:28.055
How is Susan doing?

08:28.056 --> 08:29.357
Oh, your sister is fine.

08:29.424 --> 08:31.359
She got a raise
and a promotion.

08:31.426 --> 08:33.260
That bitch.

08:33.328 --> 08:35.145
CARLA:
Hey, guys.

08:35.212 --> 08:37.581
Guys, guess what grown-up
bar manager

08:37.650 --> 08:40.417
is still getting an allowance
from her Navy dad.

08:40.485 --> 08:41.668
Who?

08:41.736 --> 08:43.486
SAM:
An allowance, huh?

08:43.554 --> 08:46.123
That explains how she
can afford a fancy car

08:46.191 --> 08:47.758
and that apartment of hers.

08:47.759 --> 08:49.043
Boy, imagine somebody getting

08:49.044 --> 08:50.978
an allowance at her age, huh?

08:51.046 --> 08:53.481
My ma cut me off when I was 30.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.269
No ifs, ands or buts,
and it hurt, I tell you.

08:58.337 --> 08:59.537
Hurt like hell.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.639
Oh, but it had a happy ending.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.474
Made you more self-reliant,
Cliffie?

09:03.475 --> 09:06.711
Nah, nah, a couple years later,
her pension fund went bankrupt.

09:06.778 --> 09:10.047
She had to come crawling to me
for some dough.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.683
Yeah, I just gave her
the old horse laugh.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.685
What goes around, huh, boys?

09:16.155 --> 09:19.090
It's got to be just so
demeaning, you know?

09:19.091 --> 09:20.658
You're living your
life on the dole

09:20.659 --> 09:22.393
the whole time...
take, take, take.

09:22.460 --> 09:23.790
You want that on your tab?

09:23.829 --> 09:25.029
Yeah, please.

09:25.030 --> 09:28.700
How can she look at herself
in the mirror?

09:28.701 --> 09:30.141
I would die of embarrassment.

09:40.963 --> 09:42.663
How was lunch, sweetheart?

09:42.731 --> 09:44.081
It was terrific.

09:44.149 --> 09:47.184
You know, when I was a kid,
I used to be afraid of my dad

09:47.185 --> 09:49.020
'cause he was sort of pushy
and overbearing,

09:49.021 --> 09:51.989
but I'll tell you, we have
really learned to communicate.

09:52.057 --> 09:54.391
It's just like two adults,
one on one.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.193
CARLA:
You mean like one adult

09:56.194 --> 09:58.729
asks the other one for a raise
in their allowance,

09:58.730 --> 10:00.864
and the other adult
says, "Okay, Pookie"?

10:00.865 --> 10:01.999
(chuckling)

10:02.067 --> 10:04.352
Very, very funny, Carla.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.053
Now, now, now,
let's not all jump

10:06.054 --> 10:07.254
down Rebecca's throat.

10:07.322 --> 10:09.672
I received a stipend
from my father for a time,

10:09.673 --> 10:12.226
a little out-of-pocket money
to spend as I saw fit

10:12.227 --> 10:14.028
on entertainment,
what have you.

10:14.029 --> 10:15.212
So, you see, I've been through

10:15.213 --> 10:17.314
exactly what Rebecca's
going through right now.

10:17.315 --> 10:19.100
Thank you, Frasier.

10:19.168 --> 10:21.035
And then, I turned 11.

10:25.974 --> 10:27.858
Hi, Woody.
Oh, hi, honey.

10:27.859 --> 10:29.277
Did you find the apartment?

10:29.278 --> 10:31.395
Yes, Mr. Smarty-Pants,
I found it.

10:31.463 --> 10:32.730
Very funny.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.899
Now, where's
your real apartment?

10:36.284 --> 10:37.668
What are you talking about?

10:37.669 --> 10:39.771
Woody, the place
you gave me directions to

10:39.772 --> 10:42.473
was this stinky little room
with bars on the window

10:42.540 --> 10:45.109
and an old Farrah Fawcett
poster on the wall.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.912
Hey, I'm married, not dead.

10:49.347 --> 10:50.547
KELLY:
Woody,

10:50.615 --> 10:53.167
please let my family
buy us a house.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.236
Don't make me go back
to that place.

10:55.303 --> 10:56.443
Kelly, that's our home.

10:56.444 --> 10:57.655
That's all I can afford,

10:57.656 --> 10:59.023
and that's where
we're gonna live.

10:59.024 --> 11:00.190
(sighs)

11:00.258 --> 11:01.859
Well, Mr.
"No wife of mine

11:01.860 --> 11:03.561
"will have her family
buy us a house

11:03.562 --> 11:05.429
even if we have to live
like peasants" Boyd,

11:05.430 --> 11:06.864
if you insist,

11:06.932 --> 11:08.766
then I guess I have no choice.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.518
Well, first of all,
that's not my name.

11:13.906 --> 11:16.289
And second of all, I do insist.

11:16.357 --> 11:18.425
Fine, I'll move my furniture in

11:18.493 --> 11:20.360
first thing this afternoon.

11:20.428 --> 11:22.346
I have to tell you, Woody Boyd,

11:22.414 --> 11:24.044
this is the worst day
of my life,

11:24.082 --> 11:26.117
and I wish I was dead.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.652
Bye, everybody.

11:32.374 --> 11:33.858
Oh.

11:33.925 --> 11:35.860
Thank you.

11:45.103 --> 11:46.420
Hey, pretty boy!

11:46.488 --> 11:47.671
Where's my daughter?

11:47.739 --> 11:50.269
Well, she's in the office.
You want me to go get her?

11:51.492 --> 11:54.712
No, Woody, I think
he was talking to me.

11:54.779 --> 11:56.213
(chuckles):
Oh, right.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.781
Maybe a few years ago.

11:59.851 --> 12:02.403
God, this place makes me sick.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.272
Bunch of indolent do-nothings

12:04.339 --> 12:06.207
sitting around
on their fat cans.

12:06.275 --> 12:10.461
You know, if you squint
really hard, it could be Vera.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.714
You know, I happen to agree

12:13.782 --> 12:15.583
with you there, Captain.

12:15.651 --> 12:19.587
But then again, uh, we men of
uniform tend to think alike.

12:22.023 --> 12:25.326
That's not a uniform,
that's a costume.

12:25.393 --> 12:28.763
Doesn't become a uniform
till you strap on a side arm.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.498
You ever done that, son?

12:30.566 --> 12:33.501
Some days, when I'm
feeling jittery.

12:36.104 --> 12:37.204
REBECCA:
Oh, Daddy.

12:37.272 --> 12:39.006
You're back.

12:39.073 --> 12:41.842
Pookie, I've been
doing some thinking.

12:41.910 --> 12:43.210
We've got to talk.

12:43.211 --> 12:44.278
Sit down.

12:44.279 --> 12:45.512
Not another review.

12:45.513 --> 12:46.580
Yes.

12:46.581 --> 12:47.581
Another review.

12:47.582 --> 12:51.085
Princess, we have
a situation here.

12:51.153 --> 12:53.538
Now, I've butted out
of your life for 39 years.

12:53.605 --> 12:57.107
Thirty-five, Daddy.

12:57.175 --> 12:59.410
Honey, I was there.

13:00.829 --> 13:02.163
I've come to two decisions.

13:02.230 --> 13:04.665
One: I've decided
not to up your allowance.

13:04.666 --> 13:05.766
Two...

13:05.767 --> 13:06.951
I don't want to hear two.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.219
Well, you're going to.

13:08.286 --> 13:11.521
Two: I've decided to pull
the plug on your Boston life.

13:11.522 --> 13:13.657
You're coming back home
to live with your mother and me.

13:13.658 --> 13:14.992
What?!

13:15.060 --> 13:17.728
I'm sorry to say
you've made a mess of things.

13:17.796 --> 13:21.031
Now, I'm going back
to my hotel to pack.

13:21.099 --> 13:22.666
I expect you to do the same.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.001
H-Hold it a
second, Daddy.

13:24.002 --> 13:25.669
You can't do this to me.

13:25.737 --> 13:27.104
I am a grown woman.

13:27.172 --> 13:28.305
I'm an adult!

13:28.373 --> 13:30.340
I can stand on my own two feet.

13:30.341 --> 13:31.275
You heard me.

13:31.276 --> 13:32.976
You're coming back home with me.

13:33.044 --> 13:35.045
I hate you!

13:35.113 --> 13:37.180
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

13:37.248 --> 13:40.918
I wish I was adopted!

13:40.986 --> 13:44.187
I wish I was never born!

13:47.259 --> 13:49.026
I don't mind telling you

13:49.094 --> 13:51.595
that went a lot better
than I thought it would.

14:02.724 --> 14:06.143
Well, Malone, how long do you
think she can stay in there?

14:06.211 --> 14:07.411
Sorry to say, sir,

14:07.412 --> 14:08.512
for a long time.

14:08.513 --> 14:09.713
There's food in there,
there's water,

14:09.714 --> 14:11.615
and the sofa pulls out
into a bed.

14:11.683 --> 14:13.935
Well, there's a shock, sex boy.

14:14.002 --> 14:15.386
Hey. You asked...

14:18.373 --> 14:19.823
Daddy,

14:19.891 --> 14:21.742
I've thought it over.

14:21.810 --> 14:23.978
You were right as usual.

14:24.045 --> 14:26.480
So I'll pack my things
and come home with you.

14:26.547 --> 14:29.116
Well, just don't stand there.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.887
Wait, wait, wait,
you can't, you...

14:33.888 --> 14:36.256
You're not just gonna pack up
and go live in San Diego.

14:36.257 --> 14:37.290
Why not?
Who am I kidding?

14:37.291 --> 14:38.341
You heard him.

14:38.342 --> 14:40.060
I'm just a failure
here in Boston.

14:40.061 --> 14:43.881
Oh, sure, I say it five years
ago and get yelled at.

14:43.948 --> 14:46.834
You're doing the right thing,
sweetheart.

14:46.902 --> 14:48.969
Your old room
is waiting for you.

14:49.037 --> 14:53.073
You'll have a chance to regroup,
get your life back in order.

14:53.074 --> 14:54.775
Yeah, that's how they
try to sell it to you,

14:54.776 --> 14:56.444
but read the small,
fine print, baby.

14:56.445 --> 14:57.845
After a couple of weeks,

14:57.912 --> 15:00.564
you'll be crazier
than a rat in a coffee can.

15:01.189 --> 15:04.819
You'd better be running along,
sweetheart.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.070
You've got a lot to do.

15:06.137 --> 15:08.371
I'll meet you
back here tonight.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.424
That- Wait-wait-wait.

15:10.425 --> 15:12.226
That's it? You're
just gonna do it?

15:12.227 --> 15:14.561
Well, he is my daddy.

15:14.629 --> 15:15.679
Well,

15:15.697 --> 15:17.031
well, he...

15:17.098 --> 15:19.283
Well, you may not be able
to do it, but I can.

15:19.284 --> 15:20.650
Excuse me for a minute, sir.

15:20.651 --> 15:22.453
You know, if you don't
mind me saying so,

15:22.454 --> 15:24.104
I-I don't think
you're being fair.

15:24.105 --> 15:25.795
You can't ask her
to pack up and go

15:25.796 --> 15:27.407
just 'cause you don't
think she made it.

15:27.408 --> 15:30.694
Was it that kind of persuasive
arguing that got my daughter

15:30.762 --> 15:33.797
into trying to conceive
your bastard child?

15:33.865 --> 15:38.052
Boy, you-you really just can't
see your way past that, can you?

15:42.607 --> 15:46.077
Everyone, I-I-I have
something to say to you.

15:46.144 --> 15:48.195
I came here to this bar
five years ago

15:48.263 --> 15:51.282
a strong, independent
business woman.

15:51.349 --> 15:53.484
And now I'm going
to go back home

15:53.551 --> 15:56.554
and move back in
with Mommy and Daddy.

15:56.621 --> 15:58.422
You've all really
touched my life.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.810
Captain Howe,
I normally make it a point

16:03.811 --> 16:06.013
not to butt into people's
personal affairs, but, sir,

16:06.014 --> 16:07.448
you are quite possibly
the meanest,

16:07.449 --> 16:09.350
most loathsome father
I've ever seen.

16:09.351 --> 16:11.985
Don't get your panties
in a bunch, son.

16:13.522 --> 16:15.689
She's not going anywhere.

16:15.757 --> 16:16.807
I beg your pardon?

16:16.824 --> 16:19.593
I was using reverse psychology.

16:19.661 --> 16:20.894
I tell her she's failed

16:20.962 --> 16:23.064
and demand that she
come home with me.

16:23.131 --> 16:26.400
She, in an effort to prove me
wrong, stands up to me,

16:26.468 --> 16:29.537
tells me off, then refuses
to take any more money

16:29.604 --> 16:31.305
from her mother and me.

16:31.373 --> 16:33.941
We don't even have
her old room anymore.

16:34.009 --> 16:35.943
It's a sewing room.

16:36.011 --> 16:38.612
Oh, that's ni-
Y-Your wife sews, huh?

16:38.679 --> 16:41.281
Don't impose
gender roles on me.

16:41.349 --> 16:43.617
Trust me.

16:43.684 --> 16:45.920
I know my daughter.

16:45.987 --> 16:48.272
It may take a little while,
but eventually

16:48.339 --> 16:50.507
she'll screw up her nerve,

16:50.574 --> 16:53.643
she'll walk through that door,
and she'll tell me off.

16:53.711 --> 16:57.614
In the meantime, I'll just,
uh, stay here and wait.

16:57.682 --> 17:01.001
Give me a beer.

17:01.069 --> 17:03.959
Sir, did I ever tell you that,
uh, I was in the Coast Guard?

17:03.960 --> 17:04.972
Coast Guard, huh?

17:04.973 --> 17:06.906
Well, you must be
very proud, Miss.

17:15.299 --> 17:18.285
So buy a girl a drink?

18:05.049 --> 18:06.216
(groans)

18:07.102 --> 18:10.521
KELLY:
Honey, it's open.

18:24.619 --> 18:26.220
Uh, Kelly?

18:26.288 --> 18:27.454
What is all this?

18:27.522 --> 18:31.892
You told me to move
all my furniture in so I did.

18:31.960 --> 18:35.228
Why? Is there a problem?

18:35.296 --> 18:38.246
Well, do you think you laid
it out in the best possible way?

18:39.968 --> 18:41.635
I don't think
it matters, Woody.

18:41.636 --> 18:43.336
We'll just live
in a cramped apartment.

18:43.337 --> 18:45.138
All right, you win.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.642
I'll call the realtor,
and-and, uh...

18:48.710 --> 18:50.460
and we'll go look
at houses, okay?

18:50.478 --> 18:52.095
You better hurry.

18:52.163 --> 18:54.047
I can't feel my legs.

19:00.004 --> 19:03.023
As a man who has 30 years
of naval experience,

19:03.091 --> 19:06.093
I can say in all confidence
that if that crew got together

19:06.160 --> 19:10.063
and shot Gilligan, they'd have
been off that island in a week.

19:11.782 --> 19:13.434
Problem solved.

19:13.501 --> 19:15.352
Well, I see it didn't
take you long

19:15.353 --> 19:17.220
to suck him into
your little world there, Norm.

19:17.221 --> 19:18.622
(chuckles):
You kidding?

19:18.623 --> 19:20.190
Give me an hour with the Pope,

19:20.191 --> 19:22.826
I'll have him singing
the Mister Ed theme.

19:22.827 --> 19:26.930
So I-I take it Rebecca
hasn't returned yet?

19:26.931 --> 19:28.599
No. I'm getting
worried, too, you know.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.801
If she was gonna stand up to
her father, she'd be here.

19:30.802 --> 19:33.003
And I'm afraid she's
gonna pack and go home.

19:33.070 --> 19:36.340
God, it'll be nice to get
my daughter off the gravy train.

19:36.407 --> 19:39.710
Finally, I can afford to retire.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.680
Daddy, I'm ready to go home.

19:45.149 --> 19:47.801
Uh, uh, just-just a second,
Pookie.

19:47.868 --> 19:50.698
Boy, looks like your little plan
didn't work, huh, sir?

19:52.089 --> 19:55.675
Uh, that-that was not a
criticism, but, uh, you know...

19:55.676 --> 19:57.411
I-I thought that was
gonna work myself.

19:57.412 --> 19:59.179
I thought it was
a damn good plan.

19:59.180 --> 20:00.531
I-I don't understand
why it didn't w...

20:00.532 --> 20:01.949
It should have worked
is what...

20:01.950 --> 20:04.768
Is it still hot
in here? I'm...

20:08.290 --> 20:10.090
Pookie, uh,

20:10.208 --> 20:12.993
I have a little
confession to make.

20:13.044 --> 20:16.413
You see, I only asked you
to come home with me

20:16.481 --> 20:19.782
so, uh, so you would
stand up to me.

20:19.850 --> 20:22.785
I was using reverse psychology.

20:22.854 --> 20:24.054
Wow.

20:24.121 --> 20:25.222
Yeah.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.956
What time does our plane leave?

20:27.025 --> 20:28.659
No, no, no, no, no, uh, Pookie.

20:28.693 --> 20:30.210
Well, you still don't get it.

20:30.277 --> 20:32.345
I was throwing
down the gauntlet

20:32.346 --> 20:33.697
to make you prove that you could

20:33.698 --> 20:35.199
take your life
in your own hands.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.766
Oh, come on, Daddy,
let's get out of here.

20:36.767 --> 20:38.502
No, no, no, no.
You're a big girl, now.

20:38.503 --> 20:39.969
You don't need me anymore.

20:40.037 --> 20:41.672
You can make it on your own.

20:41.739 --> 20:43.507
No, I can't, Daddy.
I do need you.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.392
Well, how about if, uh,

20:45.460 --> 20:47.861
how about if I raise
your allowance 25%?

20:48.964 --> 20:52.099
Just 25%?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.397
Well, I'm a bigger failure
than that, Daddy.

20:56.388 --> 20:57.955
You said so yourself.

20:58.056 --> 21:00.106
Fifty percent.

21:01.142 --> 21:03.543
Fifty percent.

21:03.611 --> 21:06.513
Maybe I can make it.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.515
Look out, Boston.

21:10.068 --> 21:12.436
Pookie, I love you.

21:12.570 --> 21:15.222
I love you, too.

21:15.289 --> 21:16.423
But you know, Daddy,

21:16.424 --> 21:18.558
with the high cost of
living and inflation...

21:18.559 --> 21:19.826
Okay, okay, okay.

21:19.894 --> 21:21.161
Seventy-five percent.

21:23.231 --> 21:24.965
Look, Pookie,
can I go home now?

21:24.982 --> 21:26.672
I got to get to work
in the morning.

21:26.734 --> 21:28.301
Oh, Daddy, you work so hard.

21:28.302 --> 21:29.702
When are you gonna
get to retire?

21:29.703 --> 21:31.538
Apparently, when they
wrap a flag around me

21:31.539 --> 21:32.972
and slide me off the ship.

21:35.043 --> 21:37.577
Rebecca Howe,

21:37.645 --> 21:40.113
you shamelessly extorted money

21:40.181 --> 21:42.049
from your own father.

21:42.116 --> 21:43.250
High five!

21:44.135 --> 21:46.236
Wait-wait-wait
a minute.

21:46.237 --> 21:47.938
So you were never
planning to leave?

21:47.939 --> 21:49.172
No way.

21:50.298 --> 21:54.111
When did you cook
this whole thing up?

21:54.112 --> 21:56.680
When I went in the office
when I was mad,

21:56.747 --> 21:58.849
I called my mother
to ask her what to do.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.285
Huh, Mom.

22:01.319 --> 22:02.652
Becks again.

22:02.653 --> 22:03.720
Yeah.

22:03.721 --> 22:05.888
The fish bit.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.557
Mother, Mother,

22:07.625 --> 22:09.092
your cut is in the mail.
