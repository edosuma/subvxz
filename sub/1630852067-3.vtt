A NETFLIX SERIES

00:16.791 --> 00:18.750
-Hi, Marcus. Welcome.
-Hi.

00:18.833 --> 00:21.291
Christmas has been turbulent for you.

00:21.375 --> 00:23.250
-You wanted to speak out.
-Yeah.

00:23.333 --> 00:26.125
There are too many people
sticking their oar in.

00:26.208 --> 00:27.833
I want to put an end to the rumors.

00:27.916 --> 00:31.208
The the-simones.org website
published an article

00:31.291 --> 00:32.541
which has been widely quoted.

00:32.625 --> 00:33.791
RAP DEBRIEF
THE INTERVIEW

00:33.875 --> 00:35.291
MARCUS: BAD CHRISTMAS BUZZ REVIEW

00:35.375 --> 00:38.375
It claimed that your first hit,
"The Hourglass,"

00:38.458 --> 00:39.916
was actually a song written by Verno.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.458
It was never his song.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.875
We haven't always seen eye to eye,
but we respect each other.

00:45.958 --> 00:47.083
He was in the loop.

00:47.833 --> 00:50.125
Nobody stole anything
from anyone. Ask him.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.375
I'll take your word for it.

00:53.125 --> 00:56.458
These Simones claim
that you tried to buy them out

00:56.541 --> 00:59.958
to restore your image
following your trial.

01:00.041 --> 01:03.291
-Can you tell us more?
-It's bullshit. Making stuff up.

01:03.375 --> 01:06.583
Another story
that's been all over social media,

01:06.666 --> 01:08.791
everyone knows you and Mel split up.

01:09.541 --> 01:12.291
-Yeah.
-A huge shock to your fans.

01:13.208 --> 01:16.333
You were seen kissing another woman

01:16.416 --> 01:18.416
on Instagram on Christmas Day.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.625
Everyone is wondering.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.208
Are you seeing her?

01:24.041 --> 01:25.000
Who?

01:25.583 --> 01:26.500
The Christmas stranger.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.125
No… I'll never see her again.

01:35.083 --> 01:36.041
-Hi, everyone!
-Hi.

01:36.125 --> 01:37.375
A YEAR LATER

01:37.458 --> 01:38.916
-Hi!
-Hey, Lila.

01:43.208 --> 01:44.333
Sorry, I'm late.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.416
And the timing is bad
because the figures are

01:47.500 --> 01:48.333
great!

01:49.791 --> 01:51.250
-She scared me.
-Really?

01:51.333 --> 01:54.333
The article on feminist Christmas presents
was a hit

01:54.416 --> 01:57.583
and has placed Womenista
among the top five most popular websites.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.250
The advertisers are happy.

01:59.333 --> 02:03.000
They're throwing money at us.
Given the present context, it's indecent.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.208
And it'll boost the next articles.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.750
I sure hope so.

02:06.833 --> 02:10.375
We've made headway
on more serious subjects.

02:10.458 --> 02:12.458
Given our present visibility,

02:12.541 --> 02:15.166
an article on new sex workers
would be ideal.

02:15.250 --> 02:17.250
We have a first draft if you want.

02:17.333 --> 02:19.916
I'm totally on board with sex workers.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.708
"Ideal" is the right word.

02:21.791 --> 02:24.250
Important, necessary, but not right now.

02:24.750 --> 02:25.583
You know?

02:26.916 --> 02:28.875
Not really. Can you elaborate?

02:28.958 --> 02:31.291
It's December.
The Christmas list was a hit.

02:31.375 --> 02:32.708
Stay on topic.

02:33.583 --> 02:39.333
The feminism you hear
is the one… that sells.

02:39.416 --> 02:40.458
Not the words I'd use.

02:40.541 --> 02:42.458
I have a fantastic idea.

02:42.541 --> 02:45.041
A Christmas event.
A Womenista Christmas Eve.

02:45.125 --> 02:48.125
With artists, speakers.
Your Christmas party.

02:48.916 --> 02:51.208
You wanted to organize parties, right?

02:51.291 --> 02:53.166
-Yes.
-Yeah.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.791
Would we have free rein on the program?

02:55.875 --> 02:59.000
Sure. Provided you bring in
some VIPs and influencers.

02:59.083 --> 03:03.708
-We need to be able to communicate.
-Then can we write whatever we want?

03:03.791 --> 03:06.083
Sure thing, starting in January.

03:07.041 --> 03:08.125
All right.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.625
Do you know Mel?

03:11.458 --> 03:12.291
Mel Gibson?

03:12.375 --> 03:15.541
No. Two-million-followers Mel.
She just released a book.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.208
Yes. Mel.

03:17.291 --> 03:19.875
She's in the conference room.
She wants to talk.

03:20.958 --> 03:21.958
Let's go, girls.

03:24.416 --> 03:26.791
Goddamn Mel…

03:58.000 --> 04:00.500
-Turn it down.
-Any more and she'll be muted.

04:07.416 --> 04:10.125
Guys, I need a break.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.250
Are you serious?

04:22.583 --> 04:24.375
Okay, Francesca. That's great!

04:25.083 --> 04:27.333
-One more time.
-No, it sucks.

04:27.416 --> 04:29.583
I can't feel it. Where's Marco?

04:29.666 --> 04:31.875
You need two to sing a duet! Damn it!

04:32.458 --> 04:34.250
He had an errand. He'll be back.

04:34.333 --> 04:35.791
I want him in the booth.

04:36.583 --> 04:37.708
For the chemistry.

04:38.583 --> 04:41.250
I need to feel his voice,

04:41.833 --> 04:44.333
his skin, his muscles.

04:44.416 --> 04:47.083
-To sing a Christmas song?
-To sing, period!

04:47.833 --> 04:52.416
Remind him that the only reason I agreed
was to get him out of his own mess.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.125
He knows it. We all do.

04:54.708 --> 04:55.750
Keep going.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.041
Keep on doing your thing. It's great.

04:58.125 --> 04:58.958
You're on.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.125
It's crap.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.875
I hear you, but we need her.

05:14.125 --> 05:16.791
What are you doing?
Francesca's going berserk.

05:17.458 --> 05:18.750
I'm not going back.

05:18.833 --> 05:21.458
She wants someone.
If not you, Ludo will have to do.

05:21.541 --> 05:23.666
-What?
-My man. I owe you one.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.875
-No way.
-You see the year we've had?

05:25.958 --> 05:28.083
Under constant fire on social media.

05:28.708 --> 05:31.708
-Not one TV appearance or concert.
-I get it.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.250
-I don't need the whole list.
-Fine.

05:35.291 --> 05:38.500
You were acquitted on appeal.
The album's almost done.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.916
You're coming back from the dead.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.250
Don't blow it now.

05:47.416 --> 05:49.916
-You're right.
-Good.

05:50.500 --> 05:51.958
I know what you're wondering.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.541
Yes, I've forgiven you for Marcus.

05:55.666 --> 05:56.958
You heard from him?

05:57.875 --> 05:59.791
No. Why would I?

06:00.541 --> 06:02.958
Why not? I haven't either.

06:04.875 --> 06:07.916
I've done a lot of thinking
since our breakup a year ago.

06:09.125 --> 06:10.708
So I wrote a book. My philosophy.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.083
OPTIMIZE YOUR FEMININITY WITH MEL

06:12.166 --> 06:13.041
I signed it for you.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.000
-Your philosophy? Really?
-Yeah.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.541
800,000 copies.
The equivalent of two Marc Levys.

06:19.625 --> 06:21.125
What you learn in there

06:21.208 --> 06:23.583
is to stop focusing on our differences.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.125
Focus on what we have in common.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.416
I'm afraid to ask,
but what do we have in common?

06:32.041 --> 06:33.458
Feminism. Of course.

06:35.708 --> 06:36.916
-Yeah.
-Of course.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.541
Not that we're bored,
but why are we here exactly?

06:39.625 --> 06:40.791
Well, business.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.125
You need my help for your event.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.541
Who said we needed help?

06:45.625 --> 06:48.125
Your boss did. That's right.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.500
Digital communication,
lineup. Ring a bell?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.333
It does to me.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.250
I have tons of ideas. And…

06:55.833 --> 06:56.708
Hold on.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.291
We could invite Marcus.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.125
For his comeback.
It would create a huge buzz.

07:02.791 --> 07:05.000
-Great. Excellent idea.
-I know.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.625
A guy convicted of
incitement to violence against women

07:08.708 --> 07:10.541
headlining a feminist event!

07:11.500 --> 07:12.583
It's genius.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.250
-The charge was thrown out on appeal.
-Fine.

07:15.958 --> 07:17.416
-That changes everything.
-Yes.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.250
Listen, I'm suggesting ideas.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.291
If you don't accept good ideas…

07:21.875 --> 07:23.250
You should consider Marcus.

07:23.916 --> 07:26.916
Really.
You need to stop being so prejudiced.

07:27.583 --> 07:28.458
I miss Jeanne.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.250
So do I.

07:45.958 --> 07:47.958
YOUTH CULTURAL CENTER

08:09.791 --> 08:11.333
To the left, to the right.

08:11.416 --> 08:12.958
Up high, down low.

08:13.041 --> 08:14.625
To the left, to the right.

08:17.125 --> 08:17.958
You nailed it.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.750
-It's better than last week.
-Right?

08:20.833 --> 08:24.291
Yeah, big time.
What stage name did you choose?

08:24.375 --> 08:25.291
Tismé Salé.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.083
Good one.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.166
Samy, you go back on the drums for Tismé.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.083
<i>In the…</i>

08:38.958 --> 08:42.166
Sorry, sir,
but the beginners' class is downstairs.

08:44.541 --> 08:47.166
What's with him?
Maybe the big star got lost.

08:47.708 --> 08:48.708
Can I talk to you?

08:48.791 --> 08:50.583
Can't you see I'm working?

08:50.666 --> 08:53.083
Let's get back to it. Samy, on the drums.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.000
Tismé Salé, we came to work.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.916
I came to apologize.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.250
-I fucked up.
-Yeah, you sure did.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.000
You were right about Pascal.

09:02.791 --> 09:06.500
He's making me do
a commercial Christmas album. I'm lost.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.958
My music is crap.
I don't know who I've become.

09:12.625 --> 09:15.000
What's with you? Pull yourself together.

09:15.916 --> 09:17.791
You say your music sucks…

09:17.875 --> 09:18.708
We know you.

09:19.291 --> 09:20.833
It can't be that bad.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.833
It's okay up to here, but…

09:34.500 --> 09:36.000
Meet Francesca Alvarez.

09:48.541 --> 09:50.083
It's opera, man.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.000
What the hell?

09:51.791 --> 09:54.625
He's not even rapping.
He's yodeling like an elf.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.208
Okay. Stop laughing.

10:00.291 --> 10:02.333
I just told you it sucked.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.250
Bro… Even you guys.

10:04.958 --> 10:06.458
We can make crappy music.

10:06.541 --> 10:09.375
The main thing is
that it never leaves this room.

10:10.208 --> 10:13.333
Never leave this room?
This will be everywhere in two weeks.

10:13.416 --> 10:16.208
Right… That's easy, then. You're done.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.750
I need to cover up this mess.

10:20.541 --> 10:23.291
-Release something just before.
-I get you.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.375
Release something just before.
This goes unnoticed.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.416
You steal your own thunder.
It's covered up. Job done.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.333
Right on.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.041
Got any new tracks?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.583
You have to act fast.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.375
Dude…

10:36.458 --> 10:39.000
If you need me, you know I'll help you.

10:39.083 --> 10:41.333
-Make some kick-ass music.
-For real?

10:41.416 --> 10:44.708
For real.
And if we get a big recording studio…

10:44.791 --> 10:49.208
-In Paris. Like the stars!
-No way. Pascal's guys are everywhere.

10:49.291 --> 10:52.666
If he finds out, I'm dead,
so are you and the kids.

10:54.500 --> 10:55.958
No. Let's do it here.

10:56.041 --> 10:57.250
Like we used to.

10:57.333 --> 11:00.833
Doomed to stay in this lousy center.
Every day. It's insane.

11:00.916 --> 11:03.750
My youth center is lousy?
Go back to your mom's.

11:03.833 --> 11:05.750
Joseph, that's not what I said at all.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.416
Well, that's what I heard.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.916
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.125
I'm happy too.

11:11.208 --> 11:12.875
"Good to see you."

11:12.958 --> 11:15.375
"I'm Jean-Marc. I'm a big shot rapper."

11:15.458 --> 11:17.625
"I'm Big Jo. I run the youth center."

11:17.708 --> 11:20.958
"Want to kiss each other?
I'm Verno's boss now."

11:21.041 --> 11:24.500
-"I never give him a break."
-"I never do either."

11:24.583 --> 11:26.000
"Let's kiss each other!"

11:29.833 --> 11:32.958
Hello. The feminist workshop, please?

11:33.041 --> 11:35.208
It's on the second floor.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.333
Okay. Thank you.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.708
I'm happy to be doing this workshop.

11:51.791 --> 11:54.250
I want us to discuss a topic
that's important to me.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.416
Street harassment.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.291
Take a piece of paper…

12:00.375 --> 12:01.791
I was a bit hard on you.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.041
I wanted to apologize.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.625
You don't have to.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.333
I had it coming.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.125
I'm okay with that.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.666
It was time to move on.
We couldn't go on like that.

12:17.458 --> 12:19.666
I had a laugh reading your Christmas list.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.583
-Yeah?
-It was kind of lame.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.666
But mostly, it was funny. Just like you.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.875
Jeannot, you still have
a knack for compliments.

12:28.958 --> 12:29.958
I mean it.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.833
I picked up
a few present ideas for my macho family.

12:32.916 --> 12:35.708
-For real?
-I read it carefully.

12:36.666 --> 12:38.958
-Good to know. I'm glad.
-Anyway.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.291
Okay. We want you back.

12:48.583 --> 12:49.541
As a roommate?

12:49.625 --> 12:51.250
As a roommate too. Why not?

12:52.208 --> 12:55.541
-I'm thinking about The Simones.
-They no longer exist.

12:55.625 --> 12:56.875
We still exist.

12:56.958 --> 12:59.208
We really need you at Womenista.

12:59.791 --> 13:00.708
Really.

13:01.791 --> 13:03.875
Come speak at our Christmas event.

13:05.083 --> 13:05.958
Speak about what?

13:06.875 --> 13:07.958
About what you do.

13:08.041 --> 13:10.916
Your work with the kids.
Your activism. Your fight.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.791
What it makes you think about our times.
It could be interesting. I know it.

13:15.375 --> 13:18.000
In return, we'll do workshops with you.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.125
-Okay. Deal.
-Deal.

13:23.208 --> 13:24.041
Deal.

13:24.791 --> 13:25.625
I'm glad.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.541
-Here.
-No, thanks. I'm good.

13:29.166 --> 13:30.833
-Lunch with my man.
-What?

13:31.708 --> 13:33.208
You have a boyfriend?

13:33.291 --> 13:34.833
Yes. I have a boyfriend.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.000
We're moving in together.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.416
-No way?
-Yes.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.083
It weirds me out too, honestly.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.458
-No shit.
-It's weird.

13:43.541 --> 13:44.375
Nonsense.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.375
You guys lost it without me.

13:51.375 --> 13:53.958
<i>Don't forget that tonight is Secret Santa.</i>

13:54.041 --> 13:56.375
<i>I'm introducing my secret lover.</i>

13:57.666 --> 13:59.916
Do I know this mystery guest?

14:00.541 --> 14:02.875
Not really.
I can tell you he's astigmatic.

14:02.958 --> 14:04.875
That's very interesting.

14:04.958 --> 14:06.208
That must be Etienne.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.750
Didn't he have a work thing?

14:08.833 --> 14:10.291
It was canceled.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.291
Shit. I mean, too bad.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.375
-Hello. You're gorgeous.
-Thanks.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.500
-How are you?
-I'm excited.

14:16.583 --> 14:17.625
He's excited.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.333
Why is he excited?

14:20.416 --> 14:23.041
Secret Santa.
Finding out about your secret lover.

14:23.125 --> 14:24.875
I love Alice and her secrets.

14:24.958 --> 14:27.541
-Are his friends nice at least?
-I…

14:27.625 --> 14:29.958
-That must be him.
-I want to see this.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.166
Good evening.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.708
You look like Marcus, the rapper.

14:38.791 --> 14:41.916
-It's insane.
-What are you doing here?

14:42.625 --> 14:44.625
I… I live here, actually.

14:45.166 --> 14:47.125
-Must be at the wrong apartment.
-No!

14:47.916 --> 14:49.375
I…

14:49.458 --> 14:51.666
Alice is dating Marcus' doppelganger.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.833
-It's a compliment.
-It's not a doppelganger.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.208
-No?
-Are you dating Alice?

14:57.291 --> 14:58.750
You're not dating Zack?

14:58.833 --> 15:01.000
No, I'm Etienne.

15:01.083 --> 15:02.083
Nice to meet you.

15:03.375 --> 15:04.458
Surprise!

15:05.250 --> 15:08.583
Damn. Everything okay?
It's high up. Eight floors.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.708
-Excuse me. It's work.
-Yeah.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.583
Well, come in.

15:12.666 --> 15:13.791
Hi, honey.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.458
Put that in the kitchen.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.791
Come in.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.833
I'm so excited.

15:22.916 --> 15:25.041
I've been planning this for a month.

15:28.375 --> 15:30.833
-What is this?
-Zack's idea. You don't like it?

15:30.916 --> 15:32.625
Of course not. Are you kidding me?

15:32.708 --> 15:34.666
Alice's idea. You don't like it?

15:34.750 --> 15:36.541
Are you out of your mind?

15:36.625 --> 15:38.625
It's a shame what happened.

15:38.708 --> 15:40.541
We couldn't stand by and watch.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.583
It's special between you two.

15:42.666 --> 15:45.208
-It'd help you get back on your feet.
-What?

15:45.291 --> 15:47.250
Her boyfriend's in the next room.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.375
It's not my fault
his work thing got canceled.

15:51.041 --> 15:53.125
It's not that serious with Etienne?

15:53.208 --> 15:54.166
Are you kidding?

15:54.916 --> 15:57.000
We're about to move in together.

15:57.083 --> 15:59.541
"About to." Right.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.000
I've spent my life
dropping things I was "about to" do.

16:03.666 --> 16:04.875
About everything.

16:05.666 --> 16:08.250
Marcus, you need to give love a chance.

16:08.333 --> 16:09.875
Speaking from experience.

16:10.541 --> 16:12.833
-You're in love, man?
-I don't know.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.541
I've never felt this way before.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.666
Baby, you're crying.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.291
-No way.
-Yes, you are.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.375
Baby…

16:22.291 --> 16:24.250
-Are you crying?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.708
-What have they done to my Zacky?
-Sorry.

16:28.875 --> 16:29.708
My sister!

16:29.791 --> 16:32.708
-I'm happy to see you. You can't imagine.
-My baby.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.916
-Where's your daughter?
-Parking the car.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.916
-Silly.
-Grandma's watching her.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.583
Or the other way around.

16:38.666 --> 16:40.250
-Love your sweater.
-Right?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.291
-Gorgeous! Great boobs!
-Right?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.041
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.208
Zack and Marcus told me to drop by.

16:48.291 --> 16:50.625
-Right.
-You're Lila, right?

16:50.708 --> 16:52.750
-Yeah.
-What are you doing here?

16:52.833 --> 16:55.166
The million-dollar question.
This is my place.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.583
-You made it.
-How's my Zackballs?

16:57.666 --> 17:00.125
-Zackballs?
-A long story. I'll explain.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.625
Is that your stage name?

17:02.208 --> 17:03.875
Must be why I never made it.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.250
Jeannot, you made it! I'm so happy!

17:08.333 --> 17:10.333
Coming through, guys!

17:10.416 --> 17:11.791
The potatoes!

17:25.666 --> 17:27.125
The stars of the night!

17:27.208 --> 17:28.541
That's the real deal!

17:28.625 --> 17:30.791
Potatoes à la Zacky. Secret recipe.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.208
-The one and only.
-Unbelievable.

17:34.916 --> 17:35.750
Lila?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.291
Is it really over with Marcus?

17:38.375 --> 17:41.416
-Don't start…
-Lila. My daughter isn't here.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.166
The last time I got laid,
Hollande was president.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.333
I haven't been up all night for a while.

17:47.291 --> 17:49.458
Don't be shy. Help yourself.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.208
-I want some.
-Potatoes!

17:51.291 --> 17:53.500
-Dig in.
-I'd like me a spud.

17:53.583 --> 17:54.875
Some chorizo?

17:54.958 --> 17:56.416
I'd love some.

17:56.500 --> 17:59.500
-My name's Verno. A friend of Marcus.
-Yes, I know.

17:59.583 --> 18:04.458
-We did the plagiarism article last year.
-Okay. I see.

18:05.833 --> 18:07.125
Well, that's out.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.291
So can we move on?

18:09.375 --> 18:12.666
Girls, don't worry.
Everything's fine. Tell you what.

18:13.291 --> 18:15.000
Since that article,

18:15.083 --> 18:17.541
in the neighborhood,
they think I'm a big rapper.

18:17.625 --> 18:19.875
Unlike him, I already had street cred.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.125
-What's street cred?
-It's a rap thing.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.125
Everything's chill tonight.

18:29.208 --> 18:32.000
-Even Mel said she's forgiven us.
-Good for her.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.166
I didn't ask Mel for forgiveness.

18:35.875 --> 18:39.208
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't you regret the article?

18:42.083 --> 18:45.000
I stand by everything I do.
It's a life principle.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.458
You should try it.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.625
Well, since you insist,

18:59.708 --> 19:03.208
my secret is to cut the potato lengthwise

19:03.291 --> 19:04.750
and to butter each one.

19:04.833 --> 19:08.583
Lila didn't publish the article.
I did. She was against it.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.125
We had a fight.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.583
-It was the end of The Simones.
-Verno, potatoes?

19:15.666 --> 19:17.000
Can I have some?

19:19.583 --> 19:21.208
-How's this one?
-Beautiful.

19:32.750 --> 19:33.666
Can I have one?

19:36.500 --> 19:37.333
Thanks.

19:39.958 --> 19:42.125
Why didn't you tell me it was Jeanne?

19:43.208 --> 19:45.125
You didn't want to talk.

19:45.208 --> 19:46.666
I thought you'd used me.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.500
I'd never told anyone before.

19:52.416 --> 19:53.250
Neither had I.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.875
What difference does it make?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.041
I don't know.

20:23.916 --> 20:26.333
-How have you been?
-Fine.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.875
I've been all about music.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.250
Enjoying being single. I stopped smoking.

20:46.041 --> 20:49.166
Yeah. I didn't want to say anything…

20:49.750 --> 20:51.250
They had a thing, is that it?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.291
Well…

20:53.500 --> 20:54.916
-No--
-Well, they kissed.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.916
Looks like you disagree.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.416
Actually, they…

21:01.583 --> 21:03.416
-They sort of kissed.
-It was fake.

21:05.833 --> 21:06.666
Fake?

21:07.500 --> 21:08.708
What does that mean?

21:09.291 --> 21:11.750
-Time for Secret Santa.
-Secret Santa!

21:19.916 --> 21:20.791
Awesome.

23:02.416 --> 23:03.500
All right.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.625
Bro. What did you come looking for here?

23:07.291 --> 23:08.125
I don't know.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.166
A new vibe.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.500
-Like when we were kids.
-The vibe's here.

23:12.583 --> 23:13.833
This is your home.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.875
But power on. Don't overthink it.

23:16.833 --> 23:17.958
Read me the lyrics.

23:19.041 --> 23:20.791
<i>For chicks and stones</i>

23:20.875 --> 23:24.166
<i>We stick our necks out for dough</i>
<i>Get it done for our bros</i>

23:24.250 --> 23:27.666
<i>One magazine, guns I've got two</i>
<i>Speak and you're done</i>

23:27.750 --> 23:30.166
<i>We're shooting people down</i>
<i>Like in Baltimore</i>

23:30.250 --> 23:31.083
<i>"</i>Baltimore."

23:31.666 --> 23:33.500
Who gives a fuck about Baltimore?

23:33.583 --> 23:35.375
Why do people here love you?

23:35.458 --> 23:36.750
You sing our lives.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.125
Why do the kids look up you?
You say the truth.

23:40.208 --> 23:45.250
That's what we care about. Not Baltimore.
Who cares about Baltimore?

23:49.416 --> 23:50.708
It's gorgeous.

23:50.791 --> 23:54.333
This here, sir, is a high-end product.

23:54.416 --> 23:57.166
Old-style charm combined
with modern comfort.

23:57.250 --> 24:00.333
Fully equipped.
Photovoltaic panels on the roof.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.500
For the lady… Organic paint for the kids.

24:05.125 --> 24:06.833
We pay attention to these details.

24:06.916 --> 24:09.458
And built into the kitchen counter…

24:09.541 --> 24:11.125
An electric bike charger.

24:11.208 --> 24:13.208
As high-tech as it gets.

24:13.291 --> 24:16.000
We have a smart trash can. Look.

24:16.083 --> 24:19.000
Two plus two makes four.

24:22.500 --> 24:23.375
I'll let you

24:24.666 --> 24:25.833
continue the visit.

24:25.916 --> 24:27.375
What do you think?

24:27.458 --> 24:29.458
It's like living inside a food processor.

24:29.541 --> 24:30.625
Nonsense. Come on.

24:32.333 --> 24:33.291
I almost forgot.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.916
You can set the temperature
with your phone.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.875
Automatic cooking. Awesome.

24:38.958 --> 24:41.458
Cool it with the sarcasm. I hate that.

24:41.541 --> 24:42.958
It's not sarcasm.

24:43.041 --> 24:45.666
This is what I think. Is that a problem?

24:46.666 --> 24:48.958
What's your problem?
Why are you such a pain?

24:50.541 --> 24:53.291
-I'm not enough of a rapper for you?
-Excuse me?

24:53.375 --> 24:56.500
Don't put on the arguing act
to get 10% off on agent fees.

24:56.583 --> 24:58.625
-I don't get it.
-You don't answer my calls.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.750
I've no idea where you spend your days.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.083
Fine. 7%, but that's it.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.541
-We haven't had sex in weeks.
-Okay. 10%.

25:05.625 --> 25:08.083
I don't want you anymore.
Should I force myself?

25:09.541 --> 25:11.375
I should let you think it over.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.000
That's not what I meant.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.208
It's what you said.

25:22.958 --> 25:25.750
It's not you.
It's the stress. I can't take it anymore.

25:25.833 --> 25:29.166
Brune, Mel hovering around me. I'm tired.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.125
-That's it.
-Is that really the issue?

25:32.791 --> 25:34.916
Do you want to move in together or not?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.916
Okay! 50%.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.791
I can't tell
if it's real or fake. You're good.

25:55.750 --> 25:56.583
Yeah.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.791
You okay?

26:30.250 --> 26:32.166
It's great having you at the workshop.

26:32.666 --> 26:36.625
The Simones like the old days.
It'll cheer you up. It'll be great.

26:39.833 --> 26:42.083
-Where are we going?
-Surprise!

26:47.958 --> 26:49.291
-You serious?
-Totally.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.666
Verno asked me to work with the kids.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.958
-Let's go.
-You've got to be kidding.

26:54.791 --> 26:56.875
-I don't know what you mean.
-Come on.

27:09.166 --> 27:11.166
My aunt has five cats. Five!

27:13.208 --> 27:14.875
Ready to meet your audience?

27:15.583 --> 27:17.250
-All right, kids!
-Girls.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.791
Let's make some noise

27:18.875 --> 27:20.583
for The Simones!

27:20.666 --> 27:21.875
Yeah!

27:23.875 --> 27:26.791
Don't get carried away.
We're not here to put on a show.

27:28.041 --> 27:31.541
What? I planned
a breakdance performance. Like this.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.250
-I can dab.
-Great.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.916
Hold on, where are the boys?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.666
-Are they hiding?
-They're not here.

27:40.750 --> 27:41.750
Mehdi's here.

27:41.833 --> 27:44.250
Mehdi!

27:44.333 --> 27:46.708
-That's good.
-It's great you're here.

27:46.791 --> 27:48.750
Not my fault if my friends didn't come.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.750
Tell them to come next time.

27:50.833 --> 27:53.083
-Tell them all about it.
-Too bad for them.

27:53.166 --> 27:55.291
There's a great atmosphere.

27:55.375 --> 27:58.541
I'll leave you girls together. Plus Mehdi.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.041
Have a good afternoon.

28:01.125 --> 28:03.666
Give it up one more time for The Simones!

28:03.750 --> 28:05.250
Yeah!

28:07.125 --> 28:09.541
Lower the vocals.
It'll bring out the reverb.

28:11.416 --> 28:12.250
Marcus?

28:15.625 --> 28:16.583
I'll call you back.

28:21.666 --> 28:22.791
What brings you here?

28:25.166 --> 28:26.250
I want to talk.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.000
You have my number.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.708
You're not answering my texts.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.041
-It's not the right time.
-It hasn't been for a whole year.

28:36.750 --> 28:40.083
-What's the matter?
-I'm focusing on my album. That's all.

28:42.208 --> 28:43.291
I miss you, dammit.

28:46.500 --> 28:47.333
Baby…

28:49.250 --> 28:50.458
Where are you going?

28:51.583 --> 28:52.625
To see Francesca.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.208
Taxi!

29:12.333 --> 29:13.833
-It was awesome.
-Bye!

29:13.916 --> 29:16.250
-Bye.
-Come back next time we do this!

29:16.333 --> 29:18.291
-See you next time.
-Bye.

29:18.375 --> 29:19.875
-Bye.
-Isn't that Marcus?

29:19.958 --> 29:21.750
-Move along.
-There's Marcus.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.458
Hold on. Marcus is there?

29:23.541 --> 29:24.500
Marcus is there.

29:24.583 --> 29:25.958
Marcus is there!

29:26.041 --> 29:26.958
Hold on…

29:28.125 --> 29:29.958
You've gotta be sincere. That's rap.

29:30.041 --> 29:33.833
Diane, you've never robbed a bank.
So why is it in your lyrics?

29:34.416 --> 29:37.333
-Look. We have the champion at home.
-Hey.

29:39.166 --> 29:41.083
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

29:41.166 --> 29:43.166
-The champion.
-The champion is quitting.

29:43.250 --> 29:44.583
Our stuff is crap.

29:44.666 --> 29:47.250
-What?
-What are you doing here? Music?

29:47.333 --> 29:49.500
What we're doing is now crap.

29:49.583 --> 29:50.708
Right, Marcus?

29:50.791 --> 29:53.416
Is it crap or music? I don't know anymore.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.083
Can we listen to it, please? Marcus?

29:56.166 --> 29:58.583
-Please.
-Marcus…

29:58.666 --> 30:00.875
-Please. Yes!
-All right.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.250
-Come on in.
-Go.

30:09.500 --> 30:11.625
What is this, choir group? Get in closer.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.583
<i>What's up between us two?</i>

30:25.666 --> 30:28.000
<i>I'm not here to waste my time</i>

30:28.875 --> 30:30.333
<i>The lawyers are glad</i>

30:30.416 --> 30:33.208
<i>I'm free, I can fly</i>

30:34.208 --> 30:36.708
<i>But I can't fly if you're not there</i>

30:36.791 --> 30:39.250
<i>You're not on board, it's worthless</i>

30:39.333 --> 30:41.958
<i>I want to live this life with you</i>

30:42.041 --> 30:44.375
<i>Don't worry about us if I go out</i>

30:44.958 --> 30:46.291
<i>Our thing's strong</i>

30:46.375 --> 30:48.791
<i>Dress up, babe</i>
<i>We're going out tonight</i>

30:48.875 --> 30:51.583
<i>We'll travel the world, the hood</i>

30:51.666 --> 30:54.375
<i>The bad guys are outside</i>
<i>Your boy's a gangsta</i>

30:54.458 --> 30:56.958
<i>Tell me what's wrong</i>
<i>I like the street</i>

30:57.041 --> 30:59.541
<i>I'm done with that though</i>

30:59.625 --> 31:01.333
<i>When I say you changed me</i>

31:02.208 --> 31:04.416
<i>I'm ready to hang up my boots for you</i>

31:06.208 --> 31:08.083
<i>I like to chill on a bench</i>

31:08.166 --> 31:11.041
<i>Just to focus, never willing to comply</i>

31:11.125 --> 31:13.166
<i>Creative in deviousness</i>
<i>Never running low</i>

31:13.250 --> 31:16.000
<i>There are young Iniestas</i>
<i>Tupac Shakurs outside our doors</i>

31:16.083 --> 31:18.583
<i>If we want the big condos</i>
<i>No cosigners required</i>

31:18.666 --> 31:21.250
<i>Blame the TV, not our folks</i>

31:21.333 --> 31:24.000
<i>Brought up on action movies</i>
<i>No options, no deductions</i>

31:24.083 --> 31:26.750
<i>Guns, money redefine</i>
<i>The laws of seduction</i>

31:27.375 --> 31:29.458
<i>I'd love to tell you it's not bad</i>

31:30.166 --> 31:32.416
<i>When I open my eyes</i>
<i>I see how they operate</i>

31:32.958 --> 31:35.083
<i>Stopped wondering</i>
<i>About the next Zidane</i>

31:35.166 --> 31:37.708
<i>Now I wonder</i>
<i>About the next George Floyd</i>

31:45.000 --> 31:45.958
Hey, Alice!

31:47.750 --> 31:48.750
-Go on!
-Hey!

31:57.416 --> 31:58.375
One more time!

31:58.458 --> 31:59.833
<i>You're my real star</i>

32:00.750 --> 32:02.125
<i>You're my real star</i>

32:03.500 --> 32:04.875
<i>You're my real star</i>

32:06.416 --> 32:11.625
Hey! You guys are the real stars!
Ten minutes ago, he wanted to quit.

32:11.708 --> 32:14.666
-Now he's making the album of the year!
-Yeah!

32:14.750 --> 32:16.875
Pascal is in for one hell of a ride!

32:16.958 --> 32:18.333
<i>You're my real star</i>

32:20.083 --> 32:23.291
Pascal?
You'll never guess what I just saw.

32:23.375 --> 32:24.208
Listen!

32:27.625 --> 32:30.416
I've got to say, Alice,
your riff was amazing.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.708
-I know.
-You have a shot as a career.

32:32.791 --> 32:36.541
-I was thinking, an EP on feminism…
-Lila!

32:42.375 --> 32:44.875
Did you see what happened? That was crazy.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.333
There's a lot going on in my head.

32:51.875 --> 32:54.041
I'd lost faith in my career. But…

32:54.125 --> 32:56.625
You see you can make songs
without insulting women.

33:00.041 --> 33:03.125
-Do you have to take that?
-I should.

33:05.083 --> 33:05.916
Lila?

33:07.333 --> 33:08.250
Should we wait?

33:09.041 --> 33:10.125
And I should go.

33:12.958 --> 33:13.833
Well, good night.

33:19.666 --> 33:22.166
Anyway, it was nice seeing you like that.

33:23.416 --> 33:25.250
It was nice seeing you, period.

33:28.625 --> 33:30.000
What now?

33:30.083 --> 33:32.083
Stop laughing at everything I say.

33:34.083 --> 33:35.291
Stop being so funny.

33:59.791 --> 34:00.958
B flat, yeah.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.708
Fuck it.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.541
Shouldn't you get that?

35:01.250 --> 35:03.333
-No.
-You're right.

35:08.958 --> 35:09.791
Damn.

35:13.250 --> 35:14.083
Let's answer.

35:22.541 --> 35:24.041
CHRISTMAS WITH YOU
MARCUS

35:24.125 --> 35:24.958
What?

35:26.666 --> 35:28.791
The bastard released the album early.

35:30.875 --> 35:32.250
WOMENISTA CHRISTMAS PARTY

35:32.958 --> 35:34.000
What's going on?

35:35.375 --> 35:37.166
Why didn't you mention the event?

35:38.041 --> 35:39.666
-What?
-My Christmas party.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.916
You're the headliner. I had no idea.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.416
Lila, the record company handles that.

35:44.500 --> 35:45.500
Yeah, sure.

35:47.041 --> 35:48.666
You seem delighted. Great.

35:48.750 --> 35:49.916
Stop it, please.

35:50.000 --> 35:50.833
Stop what?

35:53.250 --> 35:54.458
What's your problem?

35:55.041 --> 35:56.541
You know what the problem is.

35:59.458 --> 36:00.291
Yeah, I know.

36:02.333 --> 36:03.916
You don't want me.

36:04.666 --> 36:06.750
-That's crystal clear.
-You serious?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.750
We spent the night together.

36:09.833 --> 36:10.750
Thanks, ma'am.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.958
You don't want anything to do with me.

36:13.041 --> 36:14.708
You just had a trial.

36:14.791 --> 36:18.500
It's going to cloud our message.
Nothing to do with me and you.

36:18.583 --> 36:19.791
People can't change?

36:20.666 --> 36:21.708
I can't change?

36:23.083 --> 36:26.625
If you want people
to think you've changed, well, prove it!

36:27.666 --> 36:30.041
Stop letting others tell you what to do.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.833
Take some risks, for once.

36:34.083 --> 36:36.666
-Instead of playing the victim.
-Seriously…

36:38.666 --> 36:39.583
You're leaving?

36:40.166 --> 36:41.666
You were right from the start.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.083
We don't belong together.

36:46.166 --> 36:48.208
What a fucking joke!

36:51.000 --> 36:54.875
After everything I've done for you…
This is how you thank me?

36:54.958 --> 36:56.333
-Pascal, we can--
-No.

36:56.416 --> 36:59.916
You've been stringing me along
for a year. Dragging out the recording.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.750
Do you know how much I bet on you?

37:03.833 --> 37:07.458
You ditch Francesca
and go record tracks behind my back.

37:08.166 --> 37:10.291
-How do you know?
-I know everything.

37:10.958 --> 37:12.791
Besides, I warned you.

37:12.875 --> 37:15.750
Don't mess around with Daddy.
There you go.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.375
It can't be done. It doesn't work.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.250
There's a silver lining to your cloud.

37:23.833 --> 37:25.208
The album is a hit.

37:25.291 --> 37:27.416
It's our best release in six years.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.625
-We're going to fill up Bercy.
-The Arena.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.333
Right, the Arena.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.458
Francesca is talking about
bringing you on her world tour.

37:34.541 --> 37:35.791
Know what that means?

37:37.083 --> 37:38.416
I'm going to shoot myself.

37:40.041 --> 37:42.416
That your career is back on track!

37:43.083 --> 37:43.916
Well, then?

37:44.458 --> 37:45.791
Isn't that good news?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.833
And thanks to whom? Thanks to Daddy!

37:51.333 --> 37:52.166
Champagne!

37:57.666 --> 37:58.875
Damn…

37:58.958 --> 38:00.916
Gives me goosebumps every time.

38:01.666 --> 38:02.625
You're a genius.

38:03.416 --> 38:04.416
Come on, boys.

38:09.000 --> 38:09.833
There she is.

38:11.333 --> 38:13.458
You changed the lineup without telling us?

38:13.541 --> 38:15.291
You weren't here. Mel and I did it.

38:15.375 --> 38:18.541
Marcus is a great idea.
His album is a hit.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.916
The advertisers are ecstatic.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.000
Who did you ditch to fit him in?

38:23.083 --> 38:26.208
I don't remember.
A boring speech on high school students.

38:26.291 --> 38:27.666
-Right?
-Middle school.

38:27.750 --> 38:29.375
High school, middle school.

38:30.375 --> 38:33.125
-If you approve this, we're out.
-I understand.

38:33.958 --> 38:34.791
Thank you.

38:35.583 --> 38:36.958
We worked hard and--

38:37.041 --> 38:39.625
I feel we've run our course.
Better stop now.

38:41.375 --> 38:43.583
Stop what? Womenista?

38:43.666 --> 38:44.583
No, you.

38:45.208 --> 38:47.416
You stop. Womenista is mine.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.708
It'll keep going. And it's a big hit.

38:49.791 --> 38:52.000
We're launching a range of products.

38:52.083 --> 38:55.166
Beauty mag, clothing line…
You'll see, it's great.

38:58.458 --> 38:59.416
Anaïs?

39:07.333 --> 39:08.833
How have we come to this?

39:08.916 --> 39:12.958
How have I come to this?
I don't understand. Am I stupid?

39:13.041 --> 39:15.250
I'm so stupid!

39:15.333 --> 39:16.916
No, sweetie. Stop.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.125
Each time a queen runs herself down,
an iceberg melts.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.833
What's going on?

39:21.916 --> 39:24.166
We've lost everything. It's not funny.

39:27.625 --> 39:30.166
What's keeping us
from doing the Christmas party?

39:30.250 --> 39:33.291
We got fired.
You should listen before it gets awkward.

39:33.375 --> 39:36.541
No, but I meant our own event.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.000
Fuck Womenista.

39:38.791 --> 39:40.750
Why not do a Simones' Christmas?

39:40.833 --> 39:42.583
Something with energy.

39:43.166 --> 39:45.166
We don't need Brune's cash, her VIPs,

39:45.250 --> 39:46.875
her crummy Parisian venue.

39:46.958 --> 39:48.875
Sorry, her location was great.

39:48.958 --> 39:50.166
It was pretty nice.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.291
The high ceiling, the chandeliers.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.791
Are those your criteria?

39:54.500 --> 39:59.958
We'll do ours at the youth center.
We've only had girls at the workshop.

40:00.041 --> 40:03.291
If we get boys to come,
the party will have been useful.

40:03.375 --> 40:04.666
It'll be meaningful.

40:04.750 --> 40:08.041
Not like her lame-ass gala,
high ceiling or not.

40:08.125 --> 40:09.833
What about the timing?

40:09.916 --> 40:11.750
Christmas is a week from now.

40:11.833 --> 40:15.500
Verno will help us.
No risk of running into Marcus. Good.

40:15.583 --> 40:17.708
Who cares about Marcus?

40:18.291 --> 40:20.333
-Of course.
-Sure, I'm sorry.

40:20.416 --> 40:21.416
Totally.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.375
We could revive The Simones.

40:23.458 --> 40:26.083
That's what I've been trying to explain.

40:26.166 --> 40:28.833
-Can you imagine?
-It's a great idea.

40:28.916 --> 40:32.208
-It's a great idea!
-It's just that we never listen.

40:33.250 --> 40:34.500
I just said so.

40:39.875 --> 40:41.458
Hey, we're The Simones!

40:41.958 --> 40:44.208
Don't forget our feminist party
on December 24th.

40:44.291 --> 40:45.125
DECEMBER 24

40:45.208 --> 40:46.958
All the info is on Instagram.

40:47.625 --> 40:49.583
We hope you missed The Simones
as much as we did.

40:49.666 --> 40:50.500
#FEMINIST

40:50.583 --> 40:51.416
We're back!

40:52.500 --> 40:55.291
Stand-up comedy! Concerts!
Q&As with authors, artists!

40:55.375 --> 40:57.375
There will be plenty
to eat and drink. It's free.

40:57.458 --> 40:58.291
CAN'T WAIT!

40:58.958 --> 41:01.500
Don't choose between your family,
your in-laws. Join us.

41:01.583 --> 41:02.833
THE SIMONES CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS

41:02.916 --> 41:03.958
GREAT

41:04.041 --> 41:05.041
I'M BRINGING MY FRIENDS

41:05.125 --> 41:06.500
It's getting closer.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.083
I can't wait.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.208
GREAT IDEA! WE'LL BE THERE

41:09.291 --> 41:11.708
Only two days left before the party. Come.

41:11.791 --> 41:13.166
@THE-SIMONES.ORG

41:13.791 --> 41:15.666
It's like having The Simones
under the tree.

41:15.750 --> 41:16.791
SEE YOU ON THE 24TH!

41:16.875 --> 41:17.833
Like beautiful presents.

41:17.916 --> 41:18.750
Come here!

41:18.833 --> 41:19.958
SEE YOU ON THE 24TH!

41:20.041 --> 41:23.416
We want to see you,
to hear you, so come join us.

41:24.041 --> 41:25.750
Danny, come here!

41:25.833 --> 41:28.041
<i>Simones' Christmas!</i>

41:35.916 --> 41:37.375
I tried calling all day.

41:38.041 --> 41:39.458
I had stuff to take care of.

41:41.916 --> 41:45.041
What? You're going to the party with Mel?

41:46.083 --> 41:48.000
She ratted us out to Pascal.

41:48.083 --> 41:52.250
So what? Should I stay stuck
on a girl who's ashamed of me?

41:53.541 --> 41:55.125
Stop tripping, bro.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.666
It's not easy for Lila either.

41:58.583 --> 42:02.875
You have to understand something.
The world doesn't revolve around you.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.708
Go play the yes man at Womenista.

42:09.750 --> 42:10.583
You know what?

42:11.958 --> 42:16.750
You've been my idol since we were ten.
I've always wanted to hang out with you.

42:16.833 --> 42:20.083
You have something special.
Right now, you're losing it.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.625
Only you can help yourself.

42:57.250 --> 42:58.875
Shut the doors.

42:58.958 --> 43:01.333
Grandma, grab my arm. Sarah, come here.

43:01.416 --> 43:04.083
Let's hurry up. We won't get any seats.

43:10.250 --> 43:11.833
There are still a few seats.

43:11.916 --> 43:13.166
We can sit up close.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.458
Come on. Let's sit down.

43:16.541 --> 43:19.166
Excuse me. Can you move over, please?

43:19.791 --> 43:20.625
Thank you.

43:35.375 --> 43:38.833
THE PARTY'S NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOU

43:42.291 --> 43:44.166
Well, I guess we got it wrong.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.708
Hello. Thanks for coming.

43:47.791 --> 43:49.416
It was amazing!

43:49.500 --> 43:51.541
Marion, thanks for coming.

43:57.875 --> 43:59.958
Hello. Thank you for coming.

44:04.125 --> 44:04.958
Anaïs…

44:06.083 --> 44:06.916
Mel?

44:08.875 --> 44:09.708
Mel?

44:10.875 --> 44:14.250
-Yes. I'm here.
-Sweetheart? My dear.

44:16.291 --> 44:18.125
The dog. Here.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.041
It's with immense joy and pride

44:23.125 --> 44:24.833
that I'm introducing the CEO

44:24.916 --> 44:27.500
of our new clothing and beauty brand…

44:28.291 --> 44:30.416
Womenista Wear!

44:30.500 --> 44:31.666
Come on!

44:36.666 --> 44:38.125
Come on!

44:41.625 --> 44:46.666
The party's just getting started.
Don't miss Marcus' concert at 10:00 p.m.

44:46.750 --> 44:48.500
He's with us tonight!

44:48.583 --> 44:50.750
THE PARTY'S NOT THE SAME WITHOUT YOU

44:50.833 --> 44:52.500
Well done!

44:53.791 --> 44:55.333
Well, let's get started.

44:56.083 --> 44:59.125
We're so happy to have you here tonight.

44:59.208 --> 45:01.625
-Yeah, thanks.
-Thanks a lot.

45:01.708 --> 45:02.666
Right…

45:03.708 --> 45:06.500
I don't know, we can…
Are you guys pumped up?

45:09.791 --> 45:10.625
Awesome.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.208
Excuse me?

45:12.291 --> 45:14.625
I'm looking for the party. The Simones?

45:14.708 --> 45:16.583
It's here. What's your name?

45:16.666 --> 45:17.916
-Justin.
-Justin.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.833
-Nice to meet you, Justin.
-Hi!

45:19.916 --> 45:22.375
-A round of applause, please.
-Justin!

45:22.458 --> 45:23.708
Hello.

45:26.041 --> 45:27.916
And… Well…

45:28.000 --> 45:30.916
-Have a seat.
-There are some chairs in the back.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.750
-Go ahead.
-Welcome.

45:32.833 --> 45:35.208
-Hello.
-Great. Come in.

45:36.958 --> 45:39.000
-Welcome, everyone.
-Are you pumped up?

45:39.083 --> 45:40.291
Yeah!

45:40.375 --> 45:43.625
On your last album,
you invited female singers only.

45:43.708 --> 45:46.791
Tonight, you're on the front line

45:46.875 --> 45:49.083
of the most feminist party in Paris.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.916
Is it true? Has Marcus really changed?

45:52.500 --> 45:53.791
Can you stop with that?

45:55.083 --> 45:56.291
Meaning?

45:57.041 --> 46:00.166
I could tell you I've changed.
It's better if I show you.

46:01.041 --> 46:01.875
Excuse me.

46:08.708 --> 46:10.666
-Good evening, Mel.
-Good evening.

46:10.750 --> 46:13.375
You're the new CEO

46:13.458 --> 46:14.625
of Womenista…

46:17.291 --> 46:18.500
Where are you going?

46:20.958 --> 46:23.208
To be with the one
I want to spend Christmas with.

46:23.291 --> 46:25.041
…representing women,

46:25.125 --> 46:27.166
that's really exceptional.

46:27.750 --> 46:29.791
To embody all the values of feminism.

46:30.375 --> 46:33.083
I never wear heels.
Not sure if you've noticed.

46:33.166 --> 46:35.916
That's all I have to say.
It's beautiful. I'm happy.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.375
-Thank you!
-Well…

46:39.000 --> 46:41.541
If you leave, you're done. It's over.

46:41.625 --> 46:45.458
Pascal, you don't get it.
If I leave, it starts now.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.041
Mel, I'm sorry.

46:53.625 --> 46:54.458
I'm sorry.

46:57.958 --> 47:01.000
Fuck. What a gigantic pain in the ass!

47:01.083 --> 47:03.333
I'm sick and tired of little shits…

47:03.416 --> 47:06.041
More people know
what a clitoris looks like.

47:06.125 --> 47:07.000
That's great.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.458
I said people, right, not men.

47:09.541 --> 47:11.291
Women can be ignorant too.

47:11.375 --> 47:14.000
It's our body,
but no one kept us in the loop.

47:14.083 --> 47:16.291
No instructions, no information.

47:16.375 --> 47:19.666
We learn a lot quicker about dicks. Yes.

47:19.750 --> 47:22.500
You come across a lot of dicks.
I mean, not real ones.

47:22.583 --> 47:24.416
Tagged on walls,

47:24.500 --> 47:27.833
your friend in middle school
drawing dicks on your paper…

47:27.916 --> 47:31.541
You yourself will start doodling.
You don't even notice it.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.041
It's simplified, but you get it.

47:34.125 --> 47:36.458
Using a dick is pretty intuitive.

47:36.541 --> 47:39.916
It's instinctive. You see how it works.
Like a cheese grater.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.875
Never seen anyone
banging on a cheese grater.

47:43.458 --> 47:44.791
It's intuitive. Just the same.

47:44.875 --> 47:48.750
Whereas the female genitalia,
if we stick to culinary metaphors,

47:48.833 --> 47:51.500
is like a multifunctional food processor.

47:51.583 --> 47:54.208
So many options.
You can make amazing dishes.

47:54.291 --> 47:56.541
But without the instructions, nothing.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.583
With all that information,
ignorance is a choice.

48:00.666 --> 48:03.833
So please educate yourself.
Thanks for listening!

48:06.291 --> 48:07.250
Thank you!

48:13.125 --> 48:15.916
That was Joyce Ashford! Thank you!

48:16.000 --> 48:19.208
Is there anything that stuck out for you?

48:19.833 --> 48:22.166
Or subjects that you'd like to discuss?

48:22.250 --> 48:24.708
Don't be shy. You know we're nice.

48:24.791 --> 48:27.000
Here's a brave young man.

48:27.083 --> 48:28.666
Well done. What's your name?

48:28.750 --> 48:31.416
My name is Liam, and…

48:31.500 --> 48:33.541
Well, a friend wanted to know

48:33.625 --> 48:35.125
how you know if

48:35.208 --> 48:37.375
you're respecting a girl or not?

48:37.958 --> 48:40.916
If you're in doubt,
you've probably crossed the line.

48:43.333 --> 48:45.541
No, we're teasing, Liam.

48:45.625 --> 48:46.958
It's a great question.

48:47.041 --> 48:49.666
-It's for a friend.
-Of course.

48:50.291 --> 48:52.541
You have to tell your buddy

48:52.625 --> 48:56.625
that what matters is
to talk with that girl.

48:56.708 --> 49:01.583
It might seem hard at first. He'll realize
that love is about being brave.

49:01.666 --> 49:04.083
-Thanks for your question.
-You're welcome.

49:05.208 --> 49:06.166
Who's next?

49:09.291 --> 49:12.708
Grab the mic if you have something to say.

49:13.333 --> 49:17.333
Don't be afraid to speak up
if you have something important to share.

49:18.791 --> 49:21.208
-Hello.
-Great. Hello.

49:21.958 --> 49:24.875
Hi. Can you come closer
and tell us your name?

49:25.750 --> 49:26.583
Marcus.

49:27.291 --> 49:29.125
-I can't believe it!
-Is it him?

49:29.875 --> 49:31.166
It's Marcus, Mom.

49:34.708 --> 49:35.791
It's Marcus!

49:42.791 --> 49:44.333
Go on. We're listening.

49:44.416 --> 49:47.250
We're feminists,
but we're civilized. We don't bite.

49:50.291 --> 49:51.375
A friend of mine

49:51.916 --> 49:53.375
met an amazing girl.

49:54.166 --> 49:55.708
Maybe too amazing for him.

49:56.458 --> 49:59.458
They like each other,
but they're very different.

50:00.166 --> 50:02.041
So she thinks it's pointless.

50:04.333 --> 50:05.333
Well, I'm right.

50:06.125 --> 50:06.958
I mean…

50:07.875 --> 50:09.125
He knows she's right.

50:10.041 --> 50:13.208
No point in forcing things.
Apart from getting hurt.

50:13.791 --> 50:14.666
There's no point.

50:17.208 --> 50:19.166
How can we be sure if we don't try?

50:20.875 --> 50:22.083
Wouldn't it be a shame?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.708
Since he met her,
my buddy hasn't been himself.

50:26.291 --> 50:28.750
He doesn't know who he is.
He knows one thing.

50:29.625 --> 50:31.541
He needs her more than anything.

50:32.791 --> 50:34.250
He's madly in love with her.

50:37.333 --> 50:38.875
It's full-on <i>Notting Hill.</i>

50:38.958 --> 50:41.666
It's gross. Oozing all over the place.

50:46.083 --> 50:47.375
Should we give it a try?

50:47.458 --> 50:49.541
Come on, honey.

50:52.666 --> 50:53.500
Yes.

51:06.708 --> 51:09.125
SIX MONTHS LATER

51:17.500 --> 51:19.208
All right, let's go!

51:31.500 --> 51:32.916
Everyone make some noise

51:33.000 --> 51:36.416
for someone who holds
a very special place in my heart.

51:36.500 --> 51:38.666
Give it up for my little sister,

51:38.750 --> 51:39.833
MJ!

51:47.708 --> 51:50.208
MJ!

51:59.208 --> 52:03.250
THE SIMONES
MJ, GIRLS TAKE OVER THE WORLD OF RAP

52:07.000 --> 52:08.708
<i>What's up between us two?</i>

52:08.791 --> 52:11.083
<i>I'm not here to waste my time</i>

52:12.166 --> 52:13.666
<i>My lawyers are glad</i>

52:14.250 --> 52:16.666
<i>I'm free, I can fly</i>

52:17.541 --> 52:19.625
<i>I can't fly if you're not there</i>

52:20.250 --> 52:24.916
<i>You're not on board, it's worthless</i>
<i>I want to live this life with you</i>

52:25.541 --> 52:29.625
<i>Don't worry about us if I go out</i>
<i>Our thing's strong</i>

52:29.708 --> 52:32.125
<i>Dress up, babe</i>
<i>We're going out tonight</i>

52:32.208 --> 52:34.750
<i>We'll travel the world, the hood</i>

52:34.833 --> 52:37.666
<i>The bad guys are outside</i>
<i>Your boy's a gangsta</i>

52:37.750 --> 52:40.250
<i>Tell me, what's wrong</i>
<i>I like the street</i>

52:40.333 --> 52:42.583
<i>I'm done with that though</i>

52:42.666 --> 52:46.958
<i>When I say you changed me</i>
<i>I'm ready to hang up my boots</i> <i>for you</i>

52:50.375 --> 52:52.916
<i>Baby, you're the real star</i>

52:53.000 --> 52:55.666
<i>I love it when you dance</i>
<i>Right to the left</i>

52:55.750 --> 52:57.708
<i>Gucci on my suit</i>

52:57.791 --> 53:00.375
<i>If I could I'd marry you</i>
<i>You're the only one</i>

53:00.458 --> 53:04.125
