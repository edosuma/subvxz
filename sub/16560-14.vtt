WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.502
Previously on Rosewood...

00:03.128 --> 00:05.171
Damn! You had to hit him that hard?

00:05.255 --> 00:06.923
He smells like hookers and cheap tequila.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.592
Not cheap, broke, flat-ass broke.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.721
I was thinking about that conversation
we had the other day.

00:12.804 --> 00:15.890
The one where we were talking about
finding an investor for the lab.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.934
I don't remember
having that conversation with you.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.312
You have put
your heart and soul into this lab.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.189
We've got to find the right person.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.650
Now, are you sure
you want to be my partner?

00:25.984 --> 00:30.030
If your health, you know,
takes this toll again,

00:30.113 --> 00:33.033
then at least you'll know
the lab is in good hands.

00:34.534 --> 00:35.702
So, we're doing this.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.829
I ran the additional test you asked for.

00:37.912 --> 00:40.081
-Do you have family?
-Yes, but they don't know I'm here.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.416
I think you're gonna need them.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.709
Ah, thank you.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.338
Can you believe this weather?
I mean, it's like the sun gave me a hug.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.257
You hate hugs.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.008
Well, depends on who's giving them.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.761
Someone woke up
on the Rosie side of the bed.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.763
Actually, I slept a little weird.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.474
I've got his pain in my neck,
it's radiating down to my ass,

02:21.558 --> 02:24.727
but at least I get to be around
some of the greatest people in the world.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.566
-You okay?
-Yeah.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.820
Is everything all right with my mom?

02:33.903 --> 02:36.364
Yeah, never better. I mean, Daisie and I,

02:37.073 --> 02:39.159
we're like two seniors
at an after prom party.

02:39.492 --> 02:40.535
Sorry I asked.

02:42.078 --> 02:45.081
We've got a warm one. High rise off
Brickell. You're up.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.041
Well, Hornstock is next in rotation.

02:47.125 --> 02:48.126
I want you on it.

02:48.459 --> 02:50.086
Tag Rosie in, MEs have their hands full.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.671
We just closed the Ogden case.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.632
That's right, you did. See?
You're all loose, you're ready to play.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.968
You don't pull your ace
in the third inning when they're on fire.

02:57.051 --> 02:58.678
I love that metaphor,
I love that strategy.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.805
I mean, Rosie and Villa make a great team.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.432
Well chosen, Cap.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.021
-What's wrong with him?
-I don't know.

03:08.479 --> 03:11.774
Everything okay with him and... your mama?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.443
Yeah, I don't know what this is.

03:13.526 --> 03:17.071
I mean, if he starts drinking green juice
and babbling about sunsets,

03:17.864 --> 03:18.907
we should be worried.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.826
Well, you know, team work
makes the dream work.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.537
That's all you have to remember.
All right?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.542
Something's weird.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.085
It's got all the latest amenities.

03:31.169 --> 03:34.589
Key fob doors, magnetic rail elevators,
the latest in tenant protection.

03:34.672 --> 03:37.508
We're not looking to buy a condo.
A man was killed in your building.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.719
I'm beyond shaken with
what happened with Mr. Huff.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.971
We take security very seriously.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.475
As I was saying,
the virtual concierge system

03:45.558 --> 03:46.935
monitors all comings and goings.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.939
Tenants scan their thumbs like so,
and the operator confirms.

03:51.022 --> 03:54.400
I've installed it in all of my buildings,
each one feeds into a central hub.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.653
It is the most advanced security system
on the market.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.737
Not advanced enough.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.114
-This records? Do you have access?
-Yes.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.368
It's on a 72 hour loop and the company's
based out of Mumbai, so...

04:04.619 --> 04:05.662
We'll get it to you.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.289
-Just may take some time.
-I can have it to you tomorrow.

04:09.666 --> 04:13.544
Apologies for startling you.
I'm Holla, the concierge's operator.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.880
And I'm Dr. Beaumont Rosewood Jr.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.549
I take it you won't be delivering
that footage in person.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.844
I'm afraid not, but it is a great pleasure
to meet you, Dr. Rosewood.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.638
And it was a pleasure
to meet you, too, Holla.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
And I hope you have a wonderful Holi...

04:25.890 --> 04:28.851
Villa, we were talking.
I can't wish her happy holidays?

04:29.394 --> 04:33.106
Experiencing Holi, the Indian festival
of colors, is on my bucket list.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.401
It actually should be on yours too.
'Cause it's really, really nice...

04:40.113 --> 04:41.990
I need to talk to the tenant
who found his body.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.158
Holla alerted the authorities

04:44.242 --> 04:46.744
when she noticed that Mr. Huff
hadn't left the building for a few days.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.872
No one noticed him lying dead
in an elevator for a few days?

04:49.956 --> 04:52.542
Other than Mr. Huff, the building
is technically unoccupied.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.961
The majority of my building's tenants
live outside the country.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.088
American real estate
is a solid investment.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.257
Tenants, they buy up a few units
and they never move in.

04:59.340 --> 05:02.760
So, the killer could've entered
this elevator at any unoccupied floor.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.304
No, not possible.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.557
The elevator, it's programmed to stop
only at occupied floors.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.642
Which in this case was Mr. Huff's floor.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.311
The only other stop is the lobby,

05:11.394 --> 05:13.313
and the concierge
keeps that clear of any riff raff.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.065
So, I assume the elevator
has an emergency hatch.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.734
Yes, but you have to remove a ceiling tile

05:17.817 --> 05:20.611
and the only way to access the shaft
is with a key fob and a code.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.572
-We take security--
-You said that already.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.282
Okay, so is this building haunted?

05:25.199 --> 05:28.703
Because Bobby Huff was attacked by someone
while the elevator was in motion.

05:28.786 --> 05:31.122
Now if you're telling me
that there's no way on to it,

05:31.205 --> 05:32.874
then we're looking at
an impossible murder.

05:33.583 --> 05:34.917
My guess is what, death by ghost?

05:35.001 --> 05:37.587
Yeah, we're gonna need a list
of your non-tenant tenants

05:37.670 --> 05:40.048
and how to reach them,
and don't forget the security footage.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.674
Let's take a look at Bobby's apartment.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.678
You can wait in the hall for us.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.437
Ugh, that's a lot of meat for a guy
living by himself.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.106
Looks like Bobby had money to burn.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.608
More like credit to burn.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.152
There's nothing but overdue notices
in his mail.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.280
Well, guess we have more in common
than a love of gadgets.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.222
We've another thing in common,
we're both fans of classic TV.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.516
You say, fan, I say, stalker.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.310
Villa, come on, don't confuse
passion with obsession.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.314
The Ways Back touched a lot of people
including Emmy voters.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.248
That explains the raw meat.

06:55.957 --> 06:56.791
Cute dog.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.501
It's not a dog. Canis lupus.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.586
It's a wolf.

07:02.338 --> 07:05.299
♪ The ones who've been there
Know it's a fact ♪

07:05.883 --> 07:09.512
♪ That the only way
To power is to find... ♪

07:09.595 --> 07:10.763
Whoa.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.515
♪ The ways back ♪

07:12.598 --> 07:15.017
Come on, guys, it's a great theme song.
You don't know it?

07:15.101 --> 07:18.146
This guy, I mean, seriously.
TMI, I'm sure is whistling it right now

07:18.229 --> 07:19.981
at her neuro pathology conference.

07:20.064 --> 07:21.232
No, it's before her time.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.735
Be that as it may, the struggles
of Toby Weisback are timeless.

07:24.819 --> 07:28.030
I mean, who hasn't been shoved into
a locker while dressed as Nikola Tesla.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.282
Pretty much everyone.

07:29.365 --> 07:33.703
Subscapular hemorrhaging at the top of the
cranium indicates blunt force trauma.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.956
And the X-Ray shows a ring fracture
at the base of the skull.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.126
So, someone smashed Bobby Huff
over the head with a heavy object?

07:40.209 --> 07:43.129
Which broke his neck
and killed him almost instantly.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.173
So how does someone sneak upon him
in an elevator?

07:45.256 --> 07:46.424
Well, maybe it was someone he knew.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.801
Well, then, Bobby must've had
some impressive friends

07:48.885 --> 07:51.179
because this someone knew how to bypass

07:51.262 --> 07:53.598
the most high-tech security system
on the market

07:53.681 --> 07:55.558
and slip onto an elevator undetected.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.394
-Skin lesions.
-No, bite marks

07:58.978 --> 08:00.813
from a Rocky mountain wood tick.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.191
The wolf in Bobby's apartment
was covered with them.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.651
Okay, what is this?
That's not a bite, is it?

08:06.110 --> 08:08.905
I noticed that earlier.
Some sort of indentation.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.782
Scanned it to identify the image.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
Kind of looks like a logo.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.082
Maybe it is.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.543
And I know where he bought it.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.756
Eduardo is a pro. He resized
Chris Ross' championship ring.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.174
This is where Bobby Huff got that ring.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.509
And you know this because?

08:29.592 --> 08:33.304
Because I was looking at
some jewelry recently.

08:34.639 --> 08:35.681
With Tawnya.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.731
You know, I don't get
why they keep the glass so clean.

08:43.814 --> 08:47.235
I mean, it's a jeweler.
We know what's going on inside.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.362
Do we really need to see it?

08:49.779 --> 08:52.573
This certainly is Mr. Rast's ring.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.201
-You already called him?
-As soon as you phoned.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.913
He should be on his way.
I could never forget this piece. Hideous.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.833
Designed the logo himself.
And, I had to make four of them.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.966
Yo, Eduardo, you called?

09:11.676 --> 09:14.136
-Alan Rast?
-Yeah.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.264
EMPD, I have some questions for you.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.101
Why do they always run?

09:33.614 --> 09:38.286
I can't believe Bobby's gone.
When I saw him the other day, he was fine.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.370
And now he's dead.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.539
And we thought you might know why.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.874
-Maybe you got into a fight?
-Fight Bobby, no.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.377
He was like a brother,
I would never hurt him.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.296
Then why did you brand his face
with your ring?

09:48.379 --> 09:52.216
You talk trash, you gave him
a little sweet chin music,

09:52.300 --> 09:55.261
-things escalated, so you killed him.
-And then you ran.

09:55.344 --> 09:59.015
-You are talking nonsense. I ran--
-Through a glass door.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.476
I saw your badge. I figured you was
after me for some less than legal bets

10:02.560 --> 10:08.441
that I may or may not have made.
I didn't know it had to do with Bobby.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.109
Rast.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.241
My friend didn't do anything wrong.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.245
Destruction of property, resisting arrest.
Illegal wagering.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.788
Your bro did a few things wrong.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.415
-And your other buddy--
-Please.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.501
-Let me tell them.
-Tell us what?

10:30.046 --> 10:33.257
We've known Bobby since we were kids.
We went to the same school.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.635
Yeah, we did everything together.
That's why we made these rings.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.927
They represent our bond.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.639
-I want to see his body.
-It's being autopsied.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.891
I don't consent.
You can't do that to Bobby.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.394
I'm sorry, but his body is the best clue
we have to finding his killer.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.564
It's my fault, he died because of my fame.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.359
-You're?
-I'm Micah Holmes,

10:51.442 --> 10:52.818
-the star in the--
-The Ways Back.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.487
You look different.

10:55.112 --> 10:57.698
Yeah, thanks to 20 years and puberty.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.367
So, Bobby wasn't a crazed fan, was he?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.369
No, he was my best friend.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.163
And I owe him everything.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.749
Bobby's pop is Irve Huff,
big time producer.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.250
He created The Ways Back.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.171
They had a open casting call
and Bobby brought Micah.

11:12.254 --> 11:16.342
He nailed the audition, got the part.
The rest is Hollywood history.

11:16.676 --> 11:21.764
After the show got canceled, I found out
that my parents spent everything.

11:22.223 --> 11:27.103
Bobby had my back, he got us out of LA,
he put us up, he got us back on our feet.

11:28.688 --> 11:29.730
I owe him my life.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.732
-Where were you the night he died?
-My place.

11:32.775 --> 11:33.984
We all were.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.946
Friday's family dinner night.
It's our tradition,

11:37.029 --> 11:40.491
-because when you come from broken homes--
-Your friends are your family.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.536
The Rosewoods' dine on Sundays.
I look forward to it every week.

11:43.953 --> 11:49.250
Bobby always cooks, but he didn't show...
this time.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.043
And you didn't think
to check on him sooner?

11:51.127 --> 11:54.046
Bobby can be a bit of a flake,
but we don't hold it against him.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.506
You wouldn't understand.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.717
But why don't you help us understand?

11:57.800 --> 12:01.137
You want proof? Bobby's menu.
Friday night.

12:04.473 --> 12:08.519
-Kevin Bacon Wrapped Shrimp?
-Yeah, he had a thing for wordplay.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.479
So, what did you guys eat
when Bobby didn't show?

12:10.730 --> 12:12.732
I grabbed take out from Food Tastes.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.693
We'll confirm that.
And we do need to test your rings.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.533
You know, I chose the blue one 'cause
I like blue, but this is way over my head.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.452
-Yes, probably.
-All right, here we go.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.537
So what's the ETA on tox?

12:29.373 --> 12:30.750
-What happened?
-We don't know.

12:30.833 --> 12:35.129
Wonderful, now that you're back,
I'd like to call team meeting.

12:36.964 --> 12:37.798
Mom happened.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.342
I, for one, have been
appreciating the strong female energy.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.761
Now I know that you're on a case

12:41.844 --> 12:45.431
but putting off financial matters
isn't going to help.

12:45.514 --> 12:47.266
One of the first things that we can do

12:47.349 --> 12:50.686
to pull ourselves
out of this financial hole

12:50.770 --> 12:55.858
is to stop using the company card
for personal expenses.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.570
Now I don't know what the Escape Room is--

12:59.653 --> 13:00.738
It was a team building exercise.

13:01.071 --> 13:02.072
Right.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.950
I'll also have to do a dust check.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.995
Which means, any and all
superfluous equipment

13:08.078 --> 13:11.499
that is not being used, we sell
to generate cashflow.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.250
Yeah, but a lot of these
are special order.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.627
Which means very expensive.

13:14.710 --> 13:19.924
You know, no offense to our new investor,
but we are in the middle of a case here.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.091
-So...
-Right, that's right.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.387
Okay, look,
preliminary toxicology screening

13:25.471 --> 13:28.808
shows high levels of opiates
in Bobby's system.

13:30.935 --> 13:37.233
Okay, so CT scan shows white matter
influx in the brain,

13:37.858 --> 13:40.027
which normally indicates
a long term drug use.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.696
But it doesn't appear tied
to cause of death.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.908
Well, and it also doesn't explain
how someone snuck on to a moving elevator.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.868
Well, these might help.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.205
I need those swabbed.
If any of Bobby's friends attacked him,

13:51.288 --> 13:54.416
his DNA will be on that ring.
But I hope we find nothing.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.878
So, still no clue how
someone snuck on to that elevator.

13:58.379 --> 13:59.922
What do we get from that security video?

14:00.005 --> 14:03.676
I think it's alien brainwashing.
Only thing that makes sense.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.180
He's been smiling all day.
I mean, I'm honestly scared for him.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.975
Well, people change,
that's not always a bad thing.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.854
Or maybe it's just my infectious smile
that's spread all--

14:14.937 --> 14:17.648
-Like a disease.
-No, I'm the cure, Villa.

14:17.731 --> 14:19.567
He's been Rosiefied, and you're next.

14:21.610 --> 14:24.363
I decompressed that feed
sent over by the virtual concierge.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.283
Okay, did you get any message or anything?
Maybe a way to contact them?

14:27.366 --> 14:28.826
-Nothing.
-All right, thanks.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.539
What? She's an important witness.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.792
She's your dream woman. Nothing but upside
because she's just a voice.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.461
No, no, she's not just a voice,
she's real person, Villa.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.046
A real person with a body.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.757
Hi, guys, either of you
would like a smoothie?

14:43.841 --> 14:46.886
Heading to the new juice bar on 2nd,
I figured I would pick some for the squad.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.806
I'm hearing very good things
about the sprouted almond surprise.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.308
I'm good.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.476
Okay, you change your mind, you text me.
Let me know.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.853
-Okay.
-Thanks.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.396
Rosiefied.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.072
-There's nothing else?
-No, that's all they sent over.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.699
There's no other footage.

15:10.868 --> 15:11.869
Wait.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.372
What if someone tampered with the camera?

15:15.998 --> 15:20.127
Okay, I'll bite. You're gloating
that you Rosiefied Hornstock.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.130
Yes, yeah, I am, but I was thinking
about Micah and his buddies.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.049
You know, they say
that fame changes people,

15:25.132 --> 15:27.092
but their friendship
reminds me of my boys.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.052
Your boys?

15:28.135 --> 15:30.304
Yeah, crew I used to run with
back in junior high school.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.307
JJ, Spence and Milo.
I mean, we did everything together.

15:33.390 --> 15:34.725
No, I bet you didn't murder together.

15:34.808 --> 15:38.395
Don't Villafy a real moment. Okay, look,
you know that they didn't kill Bobby

15:38.479 --> 15:39.980
and you know they didn't
shut off that camera...

15:40.064 --> 15:42.566
No one did,
the camera has a motion sensor.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.818
It's how the concierge can
watch all my buildings.

15:44.902 --> 15:47.112
Please, don't tell me that's why you
dragged me all the way down here.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.574
I'm in the middle of closing
on 50 condo units in Palm Acres.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.493
We're in the middle
of a murder investigation.

15:52.576 --> 15:55.996
Tell me again how employing one camera
operator makes this building more secure.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.332
It doesn't, just saves money on personnel.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.917
And so does a motion sensor.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.004
Real estate is a game of inches.
Spatially and monetarily.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.297
All right, let's ask Holla.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.758
-I'd like to hear it from her mouth.
-Her mouth? She's a machine.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.885
Villa, she's people, okay.
Now if I have to hear the same thing

16:09.969 --> 16:12.972
that Chuck's saying,
I prefer to hear it in her dulcet tones.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.058
Mr. Furwell is correct,
I monitor every building.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.353
But I can assure you,
no one gets in without me knowing.

16:19.770 --> 16:22.773
-See, that's much better.
-Maybe the killer never left.

16:28.362 --> 16:32.408
The elevator only stops on the 20th floor,
you already checked that floor.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.077
There's no way a murderer
is just lurking around.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.287
I designed this place
to keep my tenants safe.

16:38.622 --> 16:39.873
Yeah, great job with that.

16:47.589 --> 16:50.259
I thought Bobby Huff was the only tenant
living in the building.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.136
Why is the 11th floor lit up?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.014
He was, it must be some sort of glitch.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.473
Well then, we won't find anything.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.359
That's not necessary,
there's no one up here.

17:07.901 --> 17:08.944
Oh, yeah?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.362
This a glitch too?

17:15.743 --> 17:18.203
And garlic needs about 30 seconds
to a minute...

17:18.287 --> 17:19.288
Chucky.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.290
You brought guests.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.751
Detective Villa, East Miami PD.
Who are you?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.420
Pretty sure she's his mistress.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.470
-Rosie, keep your eyes on him for a while.
-I got it.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.638
I'm zeroed in on this bitch.

17:36.722 --> 17:41.101
Okay, so tell me why Chucky
moved you into his empty building

17:41.185 --> 17:42.436
and neglected to tell us.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.773
I've just moved to the US.
Chucky was generous and offered this.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.984
He's a good man and a gentle lover.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.237
-You see, I'm married.
-Yeah, we see.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.031
Okay, which one of you guys
attacked Bobby?

17:54.114 --> 17:56.909
We didn't kill him.
The whole point was to keep Alena secret,

17:56.992 --> 17:59.787
which is why someone was supposed to
vacate until this whole thing blew over.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.832
I haven't left the apartment for days.
My visa may be a bit expired.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.125
We filed for a renewal.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.376
I am innocent.

18:06.460 --> 18:10.089
-I like Bobby, he had kind eyes.
-Whoa, whoa, so you knew Bobby?

18:10.172 --> 18:11.757
We met by accident one time.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.968
My Etsy order had arrived,
and we were right outside the hallway,

18:15.052 --> 18:16.804
and it was super funny moment.
He was like--

18:16.887 --> 18:18.138
Oh, so Bobby knew your secret?

18:18.847 --> 18:19.890
Where's Furwell?

18:21.183 --> 18:22.476
We have a suspect on the run.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.939
Where is Chuck Furwell?

18:28.273 --> 18:29.858
Where is Chuck Furwell?

18:35.823 --> 18:37.157
You look like you're
in charge around here.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.909
And you look like you charge by the hour.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.745
-How much for some hot cocoa?
-More than your boss probably pays.

18:41.829 --> 18:42.871
Where is he?

18:42.955 --> 18:45.624
Paris, Tulum,
he's quite the globe trotter.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.794
Oh, that's interesting. Because I have
two officers who say they spotted Furwell

18:48.877 --> 18:50.712
enter this office building
about 20 minutes ago.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.590
Unless you got
a direct line to Magic Mike,

18:53.674 --> 18:55.342
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to help you.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.722
East Miami PD, drop it.

19:04.017 --> 19:05.018
Stop what you're doing.

19:09.606 --> 19:12.025
You realize we have people
who piece those together, right?

19:12.526 --> 19:14.486
You should be
a little careful with Furwell.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.030
The man has more attorneys on payroll
than actual employees.

19:17.114 --> 19:20.826
Well, I think Bobby blackmailed Furwell
about his mistress, so Furwell killed him.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.036
We have means, motive,
and opportunity.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.204
Yeah, but no murder weapon.

19:24.788 --> 19:27.166
If you find that, not even the suits
will be able to protect him.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.127
I just need to get back
to Magic City to determine what weapon.

19:30.210 --> 19:31.461
Well, check the post office.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.089
Maybe he ordered it from the same place
he got his girlfriend.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.174
Hello.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.136
I'm Detective Ira Hornstock,
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.597
I want lawyers, lots of them.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.267
Hey, can't hurt to try.
Thank you.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.650
Okay, all right, look.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.322
I don't know what your angle is,
but you made your point.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.907
Now you know what I need.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.410
I need some of that old Ira Hornstock
magic so we can solve this case.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.747
We can't hold him in there much longer,
you know that?

20:06.830 --> 20:09.708
"Magic"? Captain, I'm not a wizard.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.502
Okay? It's all about hard work
and dedication.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.463
I'm doing the same thing I've always done.

20:14.922 --> 20:17.174
Except with a little more heart.

20:18.717 --> 20:19.760
See you, Captain.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.515
-Text me as soon as you have an update.
-Will do.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.683
I have an update.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.563
I couldn't say anything
in front of the guys.

20:33.607 --> 20:35.692
But I know why Bobby's face
was marked with our ring.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.612
I really hope this doesn't end
with her slapping cuffs on you.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.657
Can we talk somewhere more private?

20:43.158 --> 20:46.328
I was with Bobby the day before he died.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.706
Bobby had addiction issues.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.043
He'd been clean for years,
but he relapsed.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.838
He called me frantic,
so I rushed over there.

20:57.756 --> 21:02.344
He had that mark on his face. Said he'd
blacked out, woke up on the floor.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.096
Must've fallen on the ring.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.765
And he asked me not to tell anyone.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.518
He said it was just a bump on the road
and I believed him.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.398
When he didn't come to dinner that night,
I didn't know what to do.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.191
Why not tell your brothers?

21:17.025 --> 21:18.235
Because he blames himself.

21:20.487 --> 21:25.242
Bobby gave me my start, but he could
never get his own career going.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.996
And I tried to help him, but he spiraled.

21:29.538 --> 21:33.417
When the show got canceled,
we just joined him at the bottom.

21:34.751 --> 21:35.794
Ten year bender.

21:36.211 --> 21:39.172
And then one night,
we had this rager at the Casa.

21:39.798 --> 21:44.011
All the wild people,
even Bobby's wolf was stoned.

21:45.053 --> 21:50.976
And he turns, and Bobby says
he didn't know anybody there.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.813
And I didn't know anybody either.

21:56.565 --> 22:00.694
So when I finally sobered up,
we decided to turn our lives around.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.363
I asked Bobby to be my chef.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.326
And you pay all your friends
to be your friends?

22:08.076 --> 22:09.119
Pay?

22:10.495 --> 22:12.164
Bobby was the one with the money.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.584
Our house, our lifestyle,
that all came from Bobby's dad

22:15.667 --> 22:17.544
because mine robbed me blind.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.172
It's always the ones closest to us
that hurt us the most.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.258
No, not my boys, we pick each other up.

22:24.259 --> 22:27.095
Wu taught himself Quicken
to keep our finances in order.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.222
I helped Rast get his GED
and Bobby...

22:32.351 --> 22:33.352
Bobby was our chef.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.231
Promise me you'll find his killer.

22:41.985 --> 22:46.531
Son, I've been spring cleaning.
Who knew we had so much storage space.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.867
And all of it is being used.

22:48.950 --> 22:54.039
But, like I was telling Mom, it's not
really fair to do this without TMI here.

22:54.122 --> 22:55.957
-Do you even know what they do?
-Do you?

22:56.041 --> 22:57.918
Well, we can always employ
the KonMari method

22:58.001 --> 22:59.419
where you only keep the things
that bring you joy

22:59.503 --> 23:02.214
but I have to admit,
everything brings me joy.

23:02.297 --> 23:05.050
Okay, Mom, listen, I really appreciate
you trying to help

23:05.133 --> 23:07.260
but you never know
when you're gonna need something.

23:07.344 --> 23:11.014
From the look of it,
you have not needed any of these.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.935
You're a genius. You are a genius.

23:15.018 --> 23:15.852
I am?

23:15.936 --> 23:18.772
I think I can use this 3D printer to help
solve Bobby Huff's murder.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.690
Pippy, Mitchie, you got to
get this thing online.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.651
Like I said, you never know
when you're gonna need something,

23:22.734 --> 23:24.111
and that's why
we're not gonna sell anything.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.362
Ha-ha. It's great.

23:26.655 --> 23:31.201
Scanner feeds the data from the wound
into the 3D printer,

23:32.160 --> 23:36.081
which creates a model
of whatever weapon killed Bobby Huff.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.709
It's gonna take a minute to warm up.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.087
It's been a while, so...

23:45.257 --> 23:46.133
There.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.509
Right.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.853
So, it looks like it's approximately
eight inches in diameter.

23:58.562 --> 24:03.650
Based on the fractures,
it's anywhere between 15 and 75 pounds,

24:03.733 --> 24:06.987
made of hardwood or metal.
But, that's a guess.

24:07.070 --> 24:10.282
I mean, there's not enough information
to determine impact velocity.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.119
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is it just me or does
that award look a lot like

24:14.202 --> 24:15.704
the murder weapon you're describing?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.831
And there was no award found
in Bobby Huff's apartment.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.207
And that looks like his place.

24:19.291 --> 24:22.878
And only one of our suspects
ever won an HMA young actor award

24:23.253 --> 24:24.963
for The Ways Back, obviously.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.883
The same suspect that would
let his best friend keep it as a gift.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.094
I need to see Micah Holmes again.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.896
Bobby Huff lives in an apartment
and his friends live here.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.440
It could be tough
being around family 24/7.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.524
Maybe he needed space.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.151
How are things
going with the new investor?

24:46.526 --> 24:48.236
-Different.
-You know, relationships change

24:48.320 --> 24:50.947
but that doesn't mean that they stop
being the people you care about.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.408
Oh gosh, I sound like Hornstock.
You are infectious.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.868
Rosie's going viral.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.328
You son of a bitch.

24:59.289 --> 25:00.332
I told you to back off.

25:00.874 --> 25:04.336
Hey, hey, everybody, stop!
Slowly turn around.

25:06.922 --> 25:07.964
Break it up!

25:13.845 --> 25:17.265
So, Micah, tell me why you and your BFFs
were at each other's throats?

25:18.808 --> 25:20.519
Micah Holmes is a punk and a liar.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.896
Why? Because he killed Bobby Huff?

25:24.439 --> 25:26.149
This is between the three of us.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.902
I get it. You know, sometimes you're gonna
butt heads with your brothers.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.696
My friend, Butters, he always has my back.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.242
But you'd get us together on the back
nine at Crandon with money on the line.

25:35.325 --> 25:38.828
Forget it. But it doesn't mean
I don't still love this son of a bitch.

25:38.912 --> 25:43.041
Stop with the best friend act.
We've pulled voice mails off your phones.

25:43.458 --> 25:48.338
Let's just say, Bobby had some
strong words for all of you.

25:49.256 --> 25:53.426
You admitted you saw him after he relapsed
but I think things got heated.

25:54.219 --> 25:58.348
Why couldn't he pull himself up like you?
Why was he such dead weight?

25:58.848 --> 26:02.227
So Micah smashed him in the head
with an HMA award

26:02.352 --> 26:04.854
and when you and Wu found out,
you attacked him.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.274
Look, I respect you not talking.

26:07.607 --> 26:11.319
You know, how many scumbags come here
ratting out their wives, their husbands,

26:11.987 --> 26:12.988
even their mothers.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.323
What you have is beautiful.

26:16.950 --> 26:17.951
Cherish it.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.327
What's your take?

26:20.787 --> 26:23.748
Well, I see microexpressions
indicating that all three men are lying.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.793
No, no, with Hornstock.
He's trying to get me to lash out, huh?

26:27.335 --> 26:29.129
I mean, this is his plan to get my job?

26:29.212 --> 26:33.174
Or maybe he's just finally looking
at the world through a Rosier lens.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.512
I'll be right back. I gotta make a call.

26:39.764 --> 26:40.807
That makes two of us.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.143
Has Tweedle Dum Dum said anything?

26:43.768 --> 26:45.353
Excuse me. No.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.066
No, but I worked with some stuff.

26:51.067 --> 26:52.861
Okay, what is wrong with you?

26:52.944 --> 26:56.823
What? I'm trying a new tactic... Empathy.
You should give it a spin.

26:56.906 --> 27:01.536
-You complimented Feldheim's tie.
-I can't appreciate a nice paisley?

27:02.412 --> 27:06.249
Look, Villa, you have to put yourself
in these guys' shoes.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.918
They had everything and lost it.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.629
This isn't about Bobby.

27:12.047 --> 27:13.048
It's about the reboot.

27:13.757 --> 27:14.799
What reboot?

27:16.426 --> 27:17.969
...we've got an Xtra exclusive.

27:18.053 --> 27:22.057
Emmy award winning series The Ways Back
the show that introduced the world

27:22.140 --> 27:25.894
to fish out of water, Toby Weisback
and his misfit friends

27:25.977 --> 27:31.399
is returning to television nearly 20 years
after airing its final episode.

27:31.483 --> 27:35.487
Now, one of the show's original producers,
Joel Schiffman, let it slip the other day

27:35.570 --> 27:40.116
that he's in discussions with several
networks about a possible reboot.

27:40.200 --> 27:44.537
The Ways Back star Katarina Van Pelt
has responded with a tweet saying,

27:44.621 --> 27:47.248
"Family reunion, who's ready?"

27:47.332 --> 27:49.167
Few months ago some Hollywood producers

27:49.250 --> 27:51.628
reached out to me
about rebooting The Ways Back.

27:52.087 --> 27:55.590
-With my character as an adult.
-Too bad you're still a child.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.385
-The deal isn't even done.
-I built you a website.

27:58.468 --> 28:02.806
I run your instagram, I answer every
single fan email, even the sex stuff.

28:02.889 --> 28:03.973
How could you not tell me?

28:04.057 --> 28:07.435
You were gonna leave for LA without them?
A fresh start.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.730
I was trying to build up the courage
to tell you.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.317
I don't want to make the same mistakes
I did as a kid. This is my last shot.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.903
So, you just... You leave us behind?

28:16.986 --> 28:18.571
Bobby got to move out, why can't I?

28:18.655 --> 28:21.783
He moved out because of you.
We came to Miami for you.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.159
-That's right.
-We've always had your back.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.912
And you only cared about yourself
and your fame.

28:25.995 --> 28:29.791
Look, you guys are like family, okay.
I get why you're fighting.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.793
But why is Bobby dead?

28:31.876 --> 28:33.378
They don't know that
because they weren't there.

28:33.962 --> 28:36.589
This is Roy and Arnold,
photographers of stars.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.717
They were outside
of Micah's house the past week

28:38.800 --> 28:40.802
for the "'90s Stars: Where Are They Now?"

28:40.885 --> 28:43.471
They uploaded some photos
of the night that Bobby was murdered.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.140
Here's Rast delivering food.

28:46.725 --> 28:49.686
Micah and Wu meeting him at the door.
They never even left that night.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.604
So, they couldn't have killed him.

28:53.314 --> 28:54.190
Told you.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.151
Did I make it in time for show and tell?

28:58.194 --> 29:00.321
You recognize this
shiny piece of self worth?

29:01.614 --> 29:02.615
Got your name on it.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.950
You found the murder weapon.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.869
The killer stole it
from Bobby's apartment.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.955
Sold to this cat lady in Hialeah
using an online dummy account.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.916
We're tracking down the location
of the original IP address

29:12.000 --> 29:14.502
but in the meantime, what do you say
we figure out which one of these clowns

29:14.586 --> 29:15.795
is gunning for best actor.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.554
It's clean. There's no blood.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.724
There's no hair or fibers
in the sample that we took.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.059
So that's not what killed Bobby.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.603
Maybe it was a Golden Globe.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.524
See that ring fracture at the base
of Bobby's skull?

29:36.608 --> 29:39.986
His head was forced down by impact
causing cranial fractures.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.154
What am I missing?

29:41.237 --> 29:43.323
Exactly. We missed the fractured bevel.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.993
See, we assumed that someone
smashed something onto Bobby's head.

29:47.076 --> 29:48.787
His head was forced down sharply.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.706
Given the spacial limitations
of the elevator...

29:51.790 --> 29:54.292
Someone would've had to have been
taller, stronger, faster

29:54.375 --> 29:58.838
and able to sneak on to a moving elevator.
I mean, how is that even humanly possible?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.256
It wasn't.

30:00.799 --> 30:03.051
You see anything? A ghost?

30:10.433 --> 30:12.018
I was kidding about the ghost.

30:12.685 --> 30:15.146
Rosie, you don't actually think
there's a ghost in here, right?

30:15.230 --> 30:18.358
Look, there might be a ghost.
But that's not what killed Bobby.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.655
So, somehow the killer
climbed through the emergency hatch

30:23.738 --> 30:25.365
and smashed Bobby on the head?

30:26.282 --> 30:28.117
No, no one hit him.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.413
Bobby Huff was alone that night,
but he wasn't really alone.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.958
Someone sabotaged the elevator.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.044
They used the elevator's
magnetic rail system

30:38.127 --> 30:40.004
to rock the cart up to the 20th floor.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.967
Then they used Bobby's own momentum
to kill him.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.053
So, you're saying the elevator
is the murder weapon?

30:47.387 --> 30:51.307
See there's a small dent
in the ceiling right about here.

30:51.850 --> 30:52.892
That's from the impact.

30:53.601 --> 30:56.729
The question is, who had
the technical prowess to pull it off.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.195
Coming!

31:09.576 --> 31:10.618
Rick Wu.

31:11.494 --> 31:12.704
You have the right to remain silent.

31:13.621 --> 31:17.000
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.627
I wasn't at Bobby's apartment
when he died.

31:19.836 --> 31:21.296
You proved that.
I couldn't have killed him.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.255
You didn't need to be.

31:22.338 --> 31:24.007
You hacked
into the building security system

31:24.090 --> 31:25.925
and messed
with the elevator's acceleration.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.803
Which flung him into the ceiling.
Deadly inertia.

31:28.887 --> 31:29.929
The impact broke his neck.

31:30.013 --> 31:32.515
You were the only one in that crew
with the know-how to pull that off.

31:32.599 --> 31:36.227
Even if I could somehow
pull that hack off, why would I kill him?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.897
Bobby was running low on cash
after his dad cut him off.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.523
Supporting you guys wasn't cheap.

31:40.607 --> 31:44.110
And his bank records show he recently
got a cash advance from a publisher.

31:44.193 --> 31:46.112
He was selling your secrets
to the highest bidder.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.865
"Tell all" meets "cook book."
Sounds like a fun read.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.159
Micah mentioned you were handling
everyone's finances.

31:51.534 --> 31:54.162
-You saw that transaction.
-Yeah, what do they call it in accounting?

31:54.245 --> 31:55.246
Protecting your assets.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.832
You all got into some bad stuff
when you were at the bottom.

31:57.916 --> 32:01.127
Stuff you didn't want out there. So you
killed Bobby to protect your secrets.

32:01.210 --> 32:05.131
That's not true. I love Bobby like
he was my own family. I wouldn't kill him.

32:05.214 --> 32:07.634
-This is crazy.
-Love makes you do some crazy things.

32:07.717 --> 32:08.718
Even if family.

32:18.019 --> 32:19.896
You're in a funk
and you're not talking to me?

32:21.940 --> 32:24.067
You're breaking all kinds
of sibling codes, bro.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.360
What's going on?

32:25.443 --> 32:27.111
'Can't believe
I was wrong about those guys.

32:28.613 --> 32:29.948
They were tearing each other apart.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.952
That doesn't mean
they didn't love each other.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.163
You know the worst fights
are always between family.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.165
'Cause they're the ones
that know you the best.

32:39.874 --> 32:41.834
Maybe the only reason that Mom
is bothering us is 'cause

32:41.918 --> 32:43.586
we're used to seeing her as just Mom.

32:44.420 --> 32:45.588
But now, she's something more.

32:46.422 --> 32:49.884
Come on, people change.
But love doesn't change.

32:51.719 --> 32:52.720
Exactly.

32:53.346 --> 32:55.056
Rick Wu hadn't changed in 20 years.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.976
He wasn't a killer then,
he isn't one now.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.521
I've got one more test to run.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.773
Yeah, but the body's down here.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.567
You're here to make me confess?

33:07.694 --> 33:09.070
I want you to tell me about Bobby.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.824
-I didn't kill him. None of us did.
-That's not what I'm asking.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.493
What was he like as a friend?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.832
You know I had friends growing up.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.835
We were inseparable, just like you guys.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.754
Then, one day, I got really sick

33:26.838 --> 33:29.257
and they never came to visit me
in the hospital.

33:30.466 --> 33:31.551
I thought they'd changed.

33:33.094 --> 33:36.347
So when I got better, I forgot about them
and I made new friends.

33:38.141 --> 33:42.020
And years later, they told me
that the reason they didn't come visit me

33:43.563 --> 33:45.106
was 'cause they didn't want
to see me like that.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.108
It was too painful for them.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.778
They hadn't changed. I changed.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.075
I don't believe that you killed Bobby.

33:58.202 --> 34:01.330
Micah never saw what The Ways Back
did to Bobby.

34:02.081 --> 34:03.207
It crushed him.

34:04.083 --> 34:06.252
His own dad wouldn't even let him
be an extra.

34:07.086 --> 34:12.133
But, Bobby bottled it up
and supported Micah.

34:13.634 --> 34:14.969
He was that good of a friend.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.555
He didn't want to burden anyone
with his pain.

34:17.889 --> 34:23.102
If he hadn't died in that elevator,
he'd have let this reboot end him.

34:23.978 --> 34:25.271
And he wouldn't have said a word.

34:30.943 --> 34:32.195
Why are we here?

34:32.278 --> 34:34.530
I'm pretty sure we covered
the entire building.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.615
Almost done.

34:36.282 --> 34:38.618
Hey, don't mind the wait,
gives us time to chit chat.

34:40.995 --> 34:42.038
So, how's Adrian?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.374
I get that you're seeing the world
with fresh eyes,

34:46.042 --> 34:51.380
it's your life, but, I mean, I don't see
what was wrong with old Hornstock.

34:54.217 --> 34:58.221
Okay, so the only way the elevator
would've accelerated that quickly

34:58.304 --> 35:02.225
is if someone had interfered with
the velocity transducer which is in there.

35:02.558 --> 35:05.436
Now we thought Rick Wu
had hacked into the access control system,

35:05.520 --> 35:08.064
but the transducer
ran on a separate network.

35:08.147 --> 35:09.482
So, whoever killed Bobby Huff

35:09.565 --> 35:11.776
had to go in there
and manually adjust the transducer.

35:11.859 --> 35:12.944
How do you know all this?

35:13.486 --> 35:15.530
Basic systems engineering, Villa.

35:15.613 --> 35:18.032
You better study up, Villa,
or the future's gonna pass you by.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.159
Who do you think installed
the cameras at Magic City?

35:21.494 --> 35:24.747
Dr. Rosewood, I see you so often,
I feel like you're a tenant.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.834
Well, sadly, this place is a little
outside my price range.

35:28.334 --> 35:30.128
You know, I think you two
should tie the knot?

35:30.211 --> 35:32.213
Does it count as eloping
if she's attached to the ground?

35:32.296 --> 35:35.091
-Is Roomba your best man?
-Best machine.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.638
-You're all right?
-Fighting a cold.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.349
-Nothing serious.
-Now you take care of yourself.

35:46.853 --> 35:50.481
So, like I was saying, the fiber glass
is leaking around the transducer.

35:50.565 --> 35:51.649
It's all over the access tone.

35:51.732 --> 35:54.610
So, whoever went in there would've had
fiberglass in their nasal passages.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.113
I tested Wu, his nose is clean.

35:57.613 --> 35:58.865
So, he's innocent.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.242
So, who killed Bobby Huff?

36:08.416 --> 36:11.419
Take your eminent domain
and shove it up your ass.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.674
Good afternoon, Miss Portsmith.
I hope you had a pleasant run.

36:16.757 --> 36:21.179
Claudine, or should I call you Holla?
What's your real name?

36:21.262 --> 36:24.098
Soon it will be inmate 5779A.

36:24.473 --> 36:27.435
You forgot to disguise your IP address
when you sold Bobby's award.

36:27.518 --> 36:28.519
It led us right to you.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.229
Although your voice
is all I needed to hear.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.273
And that hickie
that's spreading across your neck,

36:32.356 --> 36:33.983
it's actually a tick worn typhus.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.819
It's a nasty disease you picked up
from Bobby's pet wolf.

36:37.486 --> 36:40.364
'Causes rashes all over your body
and it also affects your vocal chords.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.910
I've been cleared of all wrong doings,
so get out or I'm gonna take you to court.

36:43.993 --> 36:47.622
We're here for your assistant.
She murdered your tenant, Bobby Huff.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.624
And you're also to blame
'cause you lied to us

36:49.707 --> 36:51.918
about that virtual concierge
being based in India.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.252
Mumbai is not as cheap as it used to be,

36:53.336 --> 36:55.338
so I had my assistant
handle the concierge.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.131
Why would she kill a tenant?

36:57.215 --> 37:00.593
Because Claudine here has sticky fingers
and expensive tastes.

37:00.676 --> 37:03.804
She used her access to your building
security system to rob your tenants.

37:04.180 --> 37:05.306
She waited till they weren't home

37:05.389 --> 37:06.849
and then she unlocked
their doors remotely.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.435
-But Bobby Huff was home.
-Bobby caught you.

37:09.936 --> 37:12.855
And he was gonna rat you out
to your boss, so you murdered him.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.149
Because you could've
got a job anywhere.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.236
Going away for grand larceny,
that's five to fifteen in State prison.

37:18.319 --> 37:20.655
And I'm guessing orange isn't your color.
Get up.

37:21.906 --> 37:24.617
You might want to choose
your words carefully from here on out.

37:28.537 --> 37:31.332
Claudine is headed straight to court
after she gets out of the hospital.

37:31.916 --> 37:33.251
Furwell's covering her legal fees.

37:33.876 --> 37:36.045
Well, at least Bobby Huff
can now rest.

37:36.379 --> 37:37.421
Dr. Rosewood.

37:38.381 --> 37:41.467
I just wanted to thank you
and Detective Villa before I left.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.971
We're having a table read of
The Ways Back reboot in Los Angeles.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.138
We fly out in a few hours.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.182
One way ticket?

37:49.308 --> 37:50.518
For all of us.

37:50.601 --> 37:52.853
We found a rental by the beach,
three bed room.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.398
We've had our rough patches
but family always sticks together.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.024
No matter what.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.819
I just wish Bobby could be there
for our next chapter.

38:00.653 --> 38:04.240
But I guess, in a way
he'll always be with us.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.202
You know Bobby didn't take the advance
for the book.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.955
He told the publisher to cancel the deal.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.582
He said that he can never
sell out his brothers.

38:23.884 --> 38:26.220
All right, hold on, hold on.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.810
-You smell that, right?
-That smells so good, Bro.

38:32.893 --> 38:35.104
Did somebody finally open the
Barefoot Contessa cookbook

38:35.187 --> 38:36.188
I gave them for Christmas?

38:36.272 --> 38:39.442
You know Ina Garten's definitely
at my dream dinner table

38:39.525 --> 38:42.403
right between Albert Einstein
and Karl Lagerfeld.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.865
But tonight is not just about

38:45.948 --> 38:48.451
cooking a delicious feast
for the women that I love.

38:49.410 --> 38:50.911
I want to talk about Magic City.

38:50.995 --> 38:53.789
Please, before you say anything,
I want you to know that I am sorry

38:53.873 --> 38:55.082
about the misunderstandings at the lab.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.084
You don't have to apologize.
Nothing to be sorry about.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.712
Please, baby, you don't have
to spare my feelings.

38:59.795 --> 39:02.882
I think of everyone at that lab
as part of my family, by choice.

39:02.965 --> 39:06.135
But now that I'm an investor,
we're more than family.

39:06.218 --> 39:07.219
Meaning?

39:07.303 --> 39:10.639
We just have to be open and honest
about how that lab functions,

39:10.723 --> 39:15.186
and I need to treat you more like
a partner and not just my son.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.772
So, does that make this
more of a business dinner?

39:17.855 --> 39:20.149
-No.
-'Cause we can't drink if that's the case.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.233
Gimme that.

39:21.650 --> 39:24.904
I'm talking about the lab. You can't take
"family" out of "family dinner,"

39:24.987 --> 39:27.365
unless those beans don't deliver.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.283
Oh, I know you're not talking
about my green beans.

39:29.367 --> 39:33.412
We are talking. I am taking my family
to Morgan's.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.340
-There he is.
-Thanks for stopping by.

39:44.423 --> 39:47.968
I've got a vegan burrito
with your name on it. Extra avocado.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.429
I don't know who slipped you
the Rosewood play book

39:50.513 --> 39:52.515
but you must've been studying it
the past few days.

39:52.890 --> 39:55.101
Extra avocado. That's expert level.

39:55.726 --> 39:57.269
I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

39:57.603 --> 39:58.896
You've been Rosiefied.

39:59.271 --> 40:00.606
Embrace it, it's a beautiful thing.

40:03.025 --> 40:05.611
I just like to know
why you've suddenly seen the light.

40:07.571 --> 40:08.656
I know you're sick.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.661
I'm a detective.
I follow clues for a living.

40:14.495 --> 40:18.040
You got a new investor,
you freaking put Mitchie out in the field.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.709
You've been putting your affairs in order
and I was wondering why

40:20.793 --> 40:22.420
so I followed you
to your doctor's office.

40:23.462 --> 40:24.505
So why the new attitude?

40:25.089 --> 40:26.674
To let you know
you're not alone in this.

40:27.133 --> 40:30.010
That if Ira Hornstock can walk around
with a smile on his face,

40:31.095 --> 40:32.221
you could beat anything.

40:34.723 --> 40:35.766
Thanks.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.685
I appreciate that.

40:37.768 --> 40:41.355
I don't doubt myself but it's good to have
your smile as a reminder.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.316
And you might want to
tone it down a notch.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.236
You're starting to scare everyone.
They're calling you "Woodstock."

40:47.319 --> 40:49.989
-What do you think, five percent?
-Try 50.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.576
Have you told your family yet?

40:54.452 --> 40:59.248
No, there's too much going around here
to throw this into the mix.

41:00.332 --> 41:02.585
I still have another few weeks
before I start my dialysis.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.088
I'm here for you, Rosie.

41:06.839 --> 41:10.259
Need a ride to the doc
or you need to hear a corny dad joke,

41:10.885 --> 41:12.803
-I'm your guy.
-Thanks.
