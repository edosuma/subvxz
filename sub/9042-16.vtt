HI, HONEY.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.300
- I'M FINE.
I JUST--

00:32.300 --> 00:35.067
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

00:35.067 --> 00:36.633
- AMY, IS THIS THE BIGGEST
TOWEL YOU GOT?

00:36.633 --> 00:38.167
BECAUSE I--

00:46.867 --> 00:49.000
- OH!

00:55.500 --> 00:57.633
- I WAS JUST GOING SWIMMING.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.600
- WHAT IS ROBERT DOING HERE?

01:25.600 --> 01:28.733

01:36.967 --> 01:38.600
A CASUAL BRUNCH.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.233
- AMY, COULD WE
TALK WITH YOU?

01:42.233 --> 01:44.800
- WHAT IS IT?

01:44.800 --> 01:46.233

01:46.233 --> 01:48.100
YOU'RE GOING AHEAD
WITH THE WEDDING

01:48.100 --> 01:50.033
DESPITE OUR OBJECTIONS.

01:50.033 --> 01:52.667
- YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOW THAT MAKES US FEEL.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.267
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.067

01:59.067 --> 02:00.400
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.567

OW!

02:02.567 --> 02:04.867
- AMY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

02:04.867 --> 02:06.367
- I REALLY BURNED MYSELF HERE.

02:06.367 --> 02:08.067

02:10.667 --> 02:12.000
- I'LL GET SOME BUTTER.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.900
- ACTUALLY, COLD WATER
IS THE FIRST, BEST TREATMENT.

02:14.900 --> 02:18.167
HUH, OKAY?
FEEL BETTER?

02:18.167 --> 02:19.367
- YEAH, A LITTLE.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.067

02:21.067 --> 02:23.533

02:25.933 --> 02:27.633
- OKAY?

02:27.633 --> 02:31.300

02:33.667 --> 02:35.467
[knock on door]

02:35.467 --> 02:37.400
- HELLO.

03:30.433 --> 03:33.667
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER THAT
THESE TWO ARE GETTING MARRIED.

03:33.667 --> 03:37.667
ROBBIE, PUT ON SOME CLOTHES.
YOU'RE MAKING EVERYBODY SICK.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.867
OH, PLEASE, SIT DOWN.
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

03:52.867 --> 03:56.200
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.500
OH, AMY DEAR, YOU CAN REMOVE
ALL OF YOUR FOOD,

03:59.500 --> 04:01.633
'CAUSE I'VE
MADE SOME THINGS.

04:07.767 --> 04:09.833
- SO, UH...

04:09.833 --> 04:13.200
YOU'RE FROM PENNSYLVANIA, HUH?

04:13.200 --> 04:15.333
- YES, WE ARE.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.167
- WELL, IT JUST
GOES TO SHOW YOU,

04:19.167 --> 04:22.167
EVERYBODY'S
FROM SOMEWHERE.

04:23.733 --> 04:26.467
- OH, IT'S SO WONDERFUL

04:26.467 --> 04:28.833
THAT YOU CAN
JOIN US FOR BRUNCH.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.200
HOMEMADE
BLUEBERRY MUFFINS.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.600
- OH, IT'S NICE OF YOU
TO OFFER, MARIE,

04:33.600 --> 04:36.200
BUT, ACTUALLY,
WE ALREADY ATE BREAKFAST.

04:36.200 --> 04:38.667
- THIS IS BRUNCH.

04:40.133 --> 04:42.600
- ACTUALLY,
I DON'T EAT MUFFINS.

04:42.600 --> 04:43.900
- I'M SORRY?

04:43.900 --> 04:45.300
- IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.167
HE'S NEVER HAD ONE.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.033
- YOU'VE NEVER HAD
A BLUEBERRY MUFFIN?

04:52.033 --> 04:54.033
- I'VE NEVER HAD
ANY KIND OF MUFFIN.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.633
- IN YOUR LIFE?

05:01.633 --> 05:04.100
- IT'S JUST NEVER
APPEALED TO ME.

05:08.133 --> 05:11.300
- I'LL TAKE HIS MUFFIN.
- OH, NO.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.567
IT'S NOT POLITE TO EAT
IF OTHER PEOPLE AREN'T.

05:13.567 --> 05:16.700
- DIDN'T YOU HEAR?
HE'S NEVER GONNA EAT.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.233
- FRANK.

05:22.233 --> 05:25.367
- ALL RIGHT, CAN WE AT LEAST
PUT ON THE TELEVISION?

05:25.367 --> 05:27.767
WHAT DO YOU SAY, HANK,
YOU WANT TO FLIP ON THE TUBE?

05:27.767 --> 05:30.800
- WE'RE NOT MUCH
FOR TV.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.133
- ESPECIALLY ON A SUNDAY.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.767
- WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO DO
ON A SUNDAY?

05:37.133 --> 05:39.233
- WELL, WE KIND OF LIKE
TO KEEP THAT

05:39.233 --> 05:42.800
MOSTLY FOR CHURCH
AND FAMILY.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.767
- OH, HOW...

05:45.767 --> 05:47.700
GREAT.

05:49.767 --> 05:51.267
- BY THE WAY, YOUNG LADY,

05:51.267 --> 05:54.000
DID YOU EVEN GO TO CHURCH
THIS MORNING?

05:54.000 --> 05:56.967
- UH...WE WENT TO CHURCH
LAST WEEK.

05:56.967 --> 06:00.100
THIS SUNDAY, ALL FAMILY.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.600
- GIVE ME A MUFFIN.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.967
- NO, NO, NO.
BE--BEHAVE YOURSELF.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.467
- HAH!

06:10.467 --> 06:12.800
- OH, FRANK, PUT THAT BACK!
PUT THAT BACK, FRANK!

06:12.800 --> 06:15.133
- PUT THE MUFFIN BACK!

06:15.133 --> 06:16.767
[Robert and Marie yelling]

06:28.800 --> 06:30.067
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:30.067 --> 06:31.600
WHAT ARE YOUR PARENTS
YELLING ABOUT?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.733
- LISTEN,
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.767
- WHAT?
GO HOME?

06:37.767 --> 06:40.067
- YEAH, I REALIZED THE KIDS
ARE AT THE BIRTHDAY PARTY,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.467
AND WE COULD SPEND
SOME TIME ALONE.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.967
- RAY, COME ON.
WE ALREADY HAD SEX THIS WEEK.

06:43.967 --> 06:46.933
- WHOA--WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

06:46.933 --> 06:50.533
FIRST OF ALL, THAT WAS
NINE DAYS AGO, ALL RIGHT?

06:51.833 --> 06:54.500
OKAY, LISTEN,
AMY'S PARENTS ARE IN THERE.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.800
- AMY'S PARENTS?
REALLY?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.767
OH, I'VE NEVER MET THEM.

06:58.767 --> 07:01.333
THEY MUST'VE CHANGED THEIR MINDS
ABOUT ROBERT,

07:01.333 --> 07:03.333
AND NOW THEY WANT TO
MEET YOUR WHOLE--

07:03.333 --> 07:05.000
OH, MY GOD,
I HAVE TO HELP AMY.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.933
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,

07:06.933 --> 07:11.000
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA SAY STUFF
AND GET ALL INVOLVED.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.667
LET'S JUST GO TO THE MALL,
AND YOU CAN BUY STUFF,

07:13.667 --> 07:17.000
AND I'LL WALK BEHIND YOU
AND CALL YOU PRETTY.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.333
- YOUR MOTHER IS IN THERE,

07:27.333 --> 07:30.467
AND YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT ME
GETTING INVOLVED?

07:37.567 --> 07:39.167
- LET HIM HAVE IT.
- GIVE IT BACK!

07:39.167 --> 07:40.633
- NO, MINE!

07:41.933 --> 07:43.700
- GET YOUR HAND
OUT OF MY PANTS!

07:45.133 --> 07:47.400
- HOW'S EVERYBODY DOING?
- WE'RE FINE.

07:47.400 --> 07:51.367
DAD STUFFED A MUFFIN
IN HIS POCKET.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.367
- MARIE.

07:52.367 --> 07:54.800
- OH, FINE, KEEP IT.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.433
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.333
- HEY!
HEY, HEY.

08:06.067 --> 08:08.133
- ENJOY YOUR CRUMBS.

08:15.533 --> 08:17.933
- WELL, HI.

08:17.933 --> 08:20.133
I'M DEBRA, RAY'S WIFE.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.000
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.300
- WELL, IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU TOO.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.033
SO I SEE YOU'RE
GETTING TO KNOW EVERYONE.

08:27.033 --> 08:30.367
- YES, AND AMY, PLEASE KEEP
THAT IN MIND WHEN WE TALK LATER.

08:32.767 --> 08:34.133
EXCUSE ME.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.767
- WAIT, WAIT, PLEASE.

08:35.767 --> 08:36.967
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

08:36.967 --> 08:39.600
- NO.
NO SAY.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.833
- MR. AND MRS. MACDOUGALL,

08:42.833 --> 08:46.233
I KNOW HOW AWKWARD IT CAN BE
TO COME IN AND MEET NEW PEOPLE,

08:46.233 --> 08:49.467
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THE NEW PEOPLE ARE SO...

08:49.467 --> 08:51.600
DIFFERENT.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.567
BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
13 YEARS AGO...

08:54.567 --> 08:56.733
[whispers]
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

08:56.733 --> 08:58.233
BUT AFTER A WHILE,

08:58.233 --> 09:01.267
I GREW TO LOVE ALL THE BARONES
LIKE MY OWN FAMILY,

09:01.267 --> 09:03.200
SO JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.400
13 YEARS.

09:06.433 --> 09:09.933
- DEBRA, I THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

09:09.933 --> 09:13.600
OUR FAMILIES
ARE DIFFERENT.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.167
- THAT'S TRUE.

09:15.167 --> 09:17.600
I'M NOT SURE OUR VALUES

09:17.600 --> 09:21.133
ARE QUITE THE SAME
AS YOUR VALUES.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.933
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

09:22.933 --> 09:27.500
WE'RE JUST NOT THE TYPE
OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD EVER BE...

09:27.500 --> 09:29.767
WITH YOU.

09:35.767 --> 09:37.700
- IT'S GOING GOOD.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.000
- NOW I WOULD LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.100
- MA, SIT DOWN.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.000
- I MOST CERTAINLY WILL NOT.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.200
NOW, I'VE HEARD
WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY,

09:47.200 --> 09:50.433
AND FORGIVE ME,
BUT I TAKE UMBRAGE.

09:51.233 --> 09:54.367
I TAKE SEVERE UMBRAGE.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.533
- ME TOO!
UMBRAGE!

09:58.833 --> 10:01.100
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT UMBRAGE MEANS.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.233
- SHUT UP!

10:04.800 --> 10:06.133
- OH, MY.

10:06.133 --> 10:08.567
- MOM, DAD,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST GO.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.833
- AMY, I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR TONE.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.400
- WELL, I DON'T APPRECIATE
YOU COMING HERE

10:12.400 --> 10:14.600
TO TALK ME OUT OF MARRYING
THE MAN I LOVE.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.000
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
IT'S OKAY, AMY.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.600
OKAY, IT'S MY PARENTS.

10:17.600 --> 10:21.100
THEY'RE SCREWING EVERYTHING UP.
IT'S WHAT THEY DO.

10:21.100 --> 10:22.933
- WHAT DO WE DO?

10:22.933 --> 10:25.400
- WHAT DO YOU DO?

10:27.467 --> 10:29.267
WHAT DO YOU DO?

10:30.833 --> 10:34.167
YOU WERE SMASHING
DAD'S PANTS MUFFIN!

10:40.800 --> 10:43.067
- ROBERT, THEY'RE FINE!

10:43.067 --> 10:45.000
IT'S MY PARENTS.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.833
THEY STAND THERE
AND PASS JUDGMENT

10:46.833 --> 10:48.967
AND TRY TO MAKE EVERYONE
ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.

10:48.967 --> 10:52.167
- AMY, PLEASE, I THINK YOU'RE
GETTING A LITTLE WOUND UP.

10:52.167 --> 10:53.767
- I AGREE, SWEETIE.

10:53.767 --> 10:57.600
THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE
BECAUSE YOU MISSED CHURCH TODAY.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.467
- MOTHER, I DID NOT
MISS CHURCH TODAY.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.767
I CHOSE NOT TO GO.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.600
- OH...

11:09.700 --> 11:10.833
- YOU KNOW WHY?

11:10.833 --> 11:14.100
BECAUSE ROBERT AND I
WANTED TO SLEEP IN.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.233
DON'T SAY "OH" YET.

11:17.233 --> 11:20.067
HE SLEEPS OVER MANY NIGHTS.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.167
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:22.167 --> 11:25.300
I'VE DECIDED
THAT IT'S NOT A SIN.

11:30.133 --> 11:32.267
- NOW CAN I SAY "OH"?

11:33.733 --> 11:37.100
- [clears throat] MAY I SAY
THAT WHEN I COME OVER,

11:37.100 --> 11:40.233
I NEVER SLEEP.

11:48.133 --> 11:50.767
NO, NO, NO.

11:50.767 --> 11:54.067
NO, I'M ALWAYS SLEEPING

11:54.067 --> 11:56.733
IS WHAT I AM.

11:56.733 --> 11:58.667
I'M OUT!

12:09.367 --> 12:11.433
WHY WOULD YOU TELL THEM
THAT I SLEEP OVER?

12:11.433 --> 12:13.033
- WHAT, YOU'RE TAKING
THEIR SIDE?

12:13.033 --> 12:14.333
- I'M NOT TAKING ANYBODY'S SIDE.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.667
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT YOU SHOULD RELAX!

12:15.667 --> 12:18.033
- DON'T TELL ME TO RELAX!
YOU RELAX!

12:18.033 --> 12:19.733
[knock on door]

12:24.333 --> 12:28.667
- MAMA, WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?
I'VE BEEN SITTING IN THE VAN.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.267
SO WHAT'S THE STORY?

12:31.267 --> 12:34.067
ARE WE BRINGING AMY BACK
TO PENNSYLVANIA, OR WHAT?

12:40.633 --> 12:42.567
- AMY...

12:44.933 --> 12:46.767
[door slams]

12:46.767 --> 12:48.700
- HEY, RAY.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.733
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

12:56.600 --> 12:58.067
- SO WHAT HAPPENED?

12:58.067 --> 12:59.500
- OH, PETER, IT'S AWFUL.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.233
YOUR SISTER'S
BEEN RAISING HER VOICE

13:01.233 --> 13:04.367
AND USING SALTY LANGUAGE.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.400
- WELL, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.067
YOU MOVE TO THE CITY,
FALL IN WITH THE WRONG CROWD.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.200
- YOU HEAR THAT, FRANK?
WE'RE THE WRONG CROWD.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.767
- AT LEAST WE'RE NOT LIARS.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.233
- EXCUSE ME?

13:19.233 --> 13:22.367
- EVERYBODY'S HAD A MUFFIN.

13:26.867 --> 13:29.333
YOU'RE FULL OF CRAP.

13:32.267 --> 13:33.900
- THAT'S IT.
LET'S GO, MOTHER.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.433
- BUT WHAT ABOUT AMY?

13:35.433 --> 13:37.133
- WE'LL COME BACK
AND TALK SOME SENSE INTO HER

13:37.133 --> 13:38.933
ONCE THEY'RE GONE--
COME ALONG.

13:38.933 --> 13:41.433
- LISTEN, I KNOW THAT THINGS
HAVE NOT BEEN PERFECT SO FAR.

13:41.433 --> 13:44.567
- SERIOUSLY, DEBRA,
PUNCH OUT FOR THE DAY.

13:46.433 --> 13:48.833
- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE.

13:48.833 --> 13:51.667
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK OUT
ANY DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE.

13:51.667 --> 13:55.967
- I THINK HANK AND I REALLY NEED
TO PRAY ON ALL OF THAT.

13:55.967 --> 13:57.900
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:57.900 --> 13:59.500
WHY DON'T WE PRAY TOGETHER?

13:59.500 --> 14:00.700
- WHAT?

14:00.700 --> 14:02.033
all: WHAT?

14:02.033 --> 14:05.067
- THIS IS A VALUE THAT WE ALL
ACTUALLY SHARE, RIGHT?

14:05.067 --> 14:06.433
WE COULD PRAY TOGETHER

14:06.433 --> 14:09.033
TO WORK OUT OUR DIFFERENCES
HERE AND NOW.

14:09.033 --> 14:11.900
- OH, GOD.

14:11.900 --> 14:12.967
- RAY...

14:12.967 --> 14:14.200
- WHAT?

14:14.200 --> 14:17.333
"OH, GOD."
I'M KICKING THINGS OFF.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.700
- IT'S A NICE THOUGHT, DEBRA,

14:22.700 --> 14:24.600
BUT I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT--

14:24.600 --> 14:26.000
- SEE, MARIE?

14:26.000 --> 14:29.533
I BET ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT
CHURCH IS A LOAD OF CRAP TOO.

14:29.533 --> 14:33.667
PROBABLY SPENDS ALL DAY SUNDAY
WATCHING TV IN A MUFFIN SHOP.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.500
- YOU KNOW WHAT, DEBRA?
I WILL PRAY...

14:45.500 --> 14:47.967
FOR YOU.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.800
- OH, NO.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.133
YOU DON'T PRAY FOR ME, PAL.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.633
I PRAY FOR YOU.

14:54.633 --> 14:56.533
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

14:56.533 --> 14:59.000
NO, THIS GUY
WANTS TO GO, LET'S GO.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.633
- GET UP, FRANK.

15:16.033 --> 15:18.167
- ROBERT.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.233
- RAY, GET DOWN HERE.

15:27.233 --> 15:30.367
- I'M GOOD UP HERE.
BETTER RECEPTION.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.267
OW.

15:39.900 --> 15:42.033
- [clears throat]

16:02.400 --> 16:04.900
- MR. AND MRS. MACDOUGALL,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BEGIN?

16:04.900 --> 16:07.100
- VERY WELL.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.767
DEAR LORD, WE ASK YOU,
IN THIS TIME OF TURMOIL,

16:09.767 --> 16:13.200
TO PROVIDE US
WITH WISDOM AND COMPASSION,

16:13.200 --> 16:17.567
THAT WE MIGHT ACT
IN ACCORDANCE WITH YOUR WILL.

16:17.567 --> 16:18.767
AMEN.

16:18.767 --> 16:20.200
all: AMEN.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.333
- I CAN BEAT THAT.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.500
- FRANK, WE'RE NOT COMPETING.

16:30.500 --> 16:33.267
- THIS IS HARDLY WORSHIPFUL.

16:33.267 --> 16:36.400
- OH, YEAH?
WHO MADE YOU THE PRAYER SHERIFF?

16:40.167 --> 16:43.300
- I AM NOT
THE PRAYER SHERIFF.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.733
BUT I WILL NOT LET YOU
USE OUR LORD

16:47.733 --> 16:50.100
TO CONTINUE YOUR OWN
PERSONAL ARGUMENTS.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.767
IT'S--IT'S...SACRILEGE.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.733
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:54.733 --> 16:57.333
AND LET'S PUT AN END
TO ALL THIS.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.800
DEAR LORD, PLEASE KEEP
THIS IN-LAW FAMILY

16:59.800 --> 17:02.267
THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!

17:06.700 --> 17:09.467
- FINE, THEN YOU STAY
THE HECK AWAY FROM US TOO.

17:09.467 --> 17:11.467
- YOU CAN SAY "HECK"
ALL YOU WANT.

17:11.467 --> 17:13.400
HE KNOWS YOU MEAN "HELL."

17:13.400 --> 17:14.800
- WHETHER I SAY IT OR NOT,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.400
I BELIEVE THAT IS WHERE
YOU'RE GOING!

17:16.400 --> 17:18.300
- HOW ABOUT
I TAKE YOU WITH ME?

17:18.300 --> 17:19.700
[all talking at once]

17:19.700 --> 17:22.167
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

17:22.167 --> 17:23.967
THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

17:23.967 --> 17:27.300
WHAT DID I TELL YOU, HUH?
DON'T GET INVOLVED!

17:28.500 --> 17:30.133
AND YOU GOT TO COME
TALKING AND TALKING

17:30.133 --> 17:31.800
AND GET PEOPLE PRAYING.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.133
WELL, NICE JOB, 'CAUSE NOW
WE GOT OURSELVES A HOLY WAR.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.433
I'M OUT OF HERE.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.033
- RAYMOND.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.600
RAYMOND, WAIT.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.567
I GOT TO TALK TO YOU, MAN.
- WHAT?

17:53.567 --> 17:56.700
- WHOO, WAS QUITE A MESS
IN THERE, HUH?

17:56.700 --> 17:59.667
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS.
I HATE THAT KIND OF TENSION.

17:59.667 --> 18:00.933
I MEAN, THOSE PEOPLE--

18:00.933 --> 18:04.533
THEY SHOULDN'T BE
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER.

18:04.533 --> 18:07.000
EVER.

18:07.533 --> 18:08.767
- OKAY.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.467
- THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.

18:11.467 --> 18:14.200
THIS WEDDING MUSTN'T HAPPEN.

18:14.200 --> 18:17.100
- WAIT A MINUTE, WHY ARE YOU
SO AGAINST THIS WEDDING?

18:17.100 --> 18:18.467
- [sighs]

18:18.467 --> 18:21.967
LISTEN, MAN,
FIRST, AMY WENT TO COLLEGE.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.867
THEN SHE GOT A JOB
IN THE CITY.

18:23.867 --> 18:25.433
THEN SHE MET YOUR BROTHER.

18:25.433 --> 18:27.600
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO GET MARRIED.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.267
I'M STARTING TO THINK SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE AT HOME.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.733
- BUT--BUT THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE DO.

18:38.733 --> 18:42.100
- OH, YEAH?
WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

18:42.100 --> 18:45.600
IT'S JUST ME
AND MY PARENTS, MAN.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.733
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

18:50.133 --> 18:52.267
- I HEAR YOU.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.700
- OKAY, SO WE'RE SIMPATICO,
ALL RIGHT?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.233
SO THAT'S WHY YOU AND ME

18:58.233 --> 18:59.967
ARE GONNA
BREAK UP THIS WEDDING.

18:59.967 --> 19:01.433
- WAIT A MINUTE.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.433
LOOK, I THINK YOU GOT THE WRONG
IDEA THERE, PETER, OKAY?

19:03.433 --> 19:07.133
I'M NOT FOR BREAKING UP
ROBERT AND AMY'S WEDDING.

19:07.133 --> 19:08.667
- I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS.

19:08.667 --> 19:12.167
- YEAH, BUT FRIENDS
CAN DISAGREE.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.800
- NO, THEY CAN'T.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.767
- BUT YOU JUST DISAGREED
WITH ME RIGHT THERE.

19:17.767 --> 19:19.233
- I--

19:21.833 --> 19:24.333
OH, AHA.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.600
OH, YOU ARE CRAFTY.
UH-HUH.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.200
AH, HOW I MISJUDGED YOU.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.800
- ALL RIGHT.
COME ON, PETER.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.333
- NO, NO, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MR. BARON-AY.

19:33.333 --> 19:35.367
I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP
BREAKING UP THIS WEDDING.

19:35.367 --> 19:38.667
YOUR WEIRDO FAMILY'S DONE
MOST OF THAT WORK FOR ME.

19:38.667 --> 19:42.333
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A JOB TO FINISH.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.567
- [sighs]

19:50.733 --> 19:52.600
- AMY, PLEASE COME HOME.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.733
WE'LL MAKE PEANUT BRITTLE.

19:56.733 --> 19:59.100
- HERE, MAMA, LET ME TRY.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.267
HEY, SISSY, IT'S PETEY.

20:01.267 --> 20:02.800
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON OUT,

20:02.800 --> 20:05.967
AND WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE TALK,
JUST YOU AND ME...

20:05.967 --> 20:08.333
IN THE VAN.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.300
- NO, AMY, DON'T.
DON'T COME OUT.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.700
- RAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:11.700 --> 20:15.600
- I'M GETTING INVOLVED.
SEE HOW YOU LIKE IT.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.933
STAY IN THERE, AMY!

20:16.933 --> 20:18.300
- THIS ISN'T HELPING ME.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.000
- YOU SHOULD GO IN THERE
WITH HER, ROBERT.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.633
YOU BOTH NEED
TO GET AWAY FROM US,

20:21.633 --> 20:23.333
FAR AWAY FROM ALL OF US.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.500
- RAY, THIS IS NOT
WORKING IT OUT.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.833
- IT'S NOT FOR US TO WORK OUT.

20:26.833 --> 20:28.733
WE'RE THE ONES
RUINING EVERYTHING.

20:28.733 --> 20:32.500
WE DID THIS TO YOU!
THE FAMILIES.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.300
TRUST ME, NO GOOD
CAN COME FROM FAMILIES!

20:38.067 --> 20:41.967
FORGET EVERYTHING
A FAMILY TELLS YOU!

20:41.967 --> 20:44.833
EXCEPT FOR THIS RIGHT NOW.
THIS--

20:44.833 --> 20:47.033
THIS PART IS RIGHT!

20:47.033 --> 20:50.067
YOU TWO LOVE EACH OTHER!

20:50.067 --> 20:53.133
AND ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE.

20:53.133 --> 20:56.267
LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.000
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.233
OKAY?

21:05.000 --> 21:06.467
[door opens]

21:13.733 --> 21:15.667
- SORRY.
- ME TOO.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.667
- COME ON, ROBERT.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.667
WE'RE GOING OUT
FOR BREAKFAST.

21:46.367 --> 21:50.167
- NO GOOD CAN COME
FROM FAMILY?

21:52.133 --> 21:54.600
- [whispers] HER FAMILY.
