00:15.516 --> 00:17.143


00:18.728 --> 00:20.479
There's nothing more
to be done.

00:20.563 --> 00:23.232
His fate lies with the gods.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.401
Liar!

00:27.570 --> 00:30.489
Sylas, please, hold on.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.873
This is not the end.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.499
Uh...

01:34.094 --> 01:37.598
<i>"Kuthos Lavi Kushak</i>

01:37.598 --> 01:42.520
<i>Vetom Grash Thidrondas.</i>

01:42.520 --> 01:44.688
<i>Oo Dovidi...</i>

01:44.772 --> 01:46.774
<i>Rudas...</i>

01:46.774 --> 01:48.818

01:48.818 --> 01:51.362

02:25.521 --> 02:29.191
Oh, Sylas, it-it worked.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.569
Yes, my love.

02:31.569 --> 02:33.571
I feel better.

02:33.571 --> 02:36.866
Different.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.496
Your heart.

02:50.713 --> 02:53.465
Mmm.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.759
I should be down there fighting.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.345
No. We've not come this far

02:58.429 --> 03:01.473
to have our plans spoiled.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.310
You are more precious to me
than you'll ever know.

03:04.310 --> 03:06.478
Trust in the Whispered One,

03:06.562 --> 03:09.148
for we are his blood.

03:09.148 --> 03:12.902
What did you do, my dear?

04:36.944 --> 04:39.363
Holy sh...

04:41.115 --> 04:43.409
We may want
to get out of here.

04:44.994 --> 04:48.247
Aren't these things
supposed to be slow?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.252
Come on!
Let's move!

04:56.964 --> 04:59.717
In case I wasn't clear before,
the undead freak me out.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.552
I mean, why?

05:08.225 --> 05:11.353
Excuse us. Coming through!

05:11.437 --> 05:14.565
Everyone, follow Grog!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.778
More of them?

05:19.862 --> 05:23.157
How many dead people are
in your stupid town, Percy?!

05:23.157 --> 05:25.159
Where'd they all come from?

05:25.159 --> 05:27.745
Uh, the ground. That's where
all dead people live.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.163
Hmm?

05:29.163 --> 05:30.372
Do you hear that?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.921
Sounds like hundreds of them.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.548
Thousands.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.635
This way! There's a safe house!

05:47.723 --> 05:49.850
Inside!

05:56.315 --> 05:58.817
Thank the Dawnfather
you made it.

05:58.901 --> 06:00.402
Barely.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.112
We saw your message in the sky.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.364
Percival, what's our next move?

06:04.448 --> 06:06.700
You're asking me?

06:06.784 --> 06:11.663
Well, we... I-I assumed since
you're the rightful heir...

06:11.747 --> 06:13.791
Titles don't matter anymore.

06:13.791 --> 06:15.501
You're the leader, Archibald.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.548
Thanks for keeping me
from becoming zombie kibble.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.093
Oh. N-No problem.

06:24.093 --> 06:25.928
You probably
would have been fine.

06:25.928 --> 06:29.306
No, I wouldn't.

06:31.642 --> 06:33.894
Stuck in
a death trap, no way out.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.896
Zombies always eat
the little guy first.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.066
They know how delectable
I am.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.319
Get ahold of yourself!

06:42.319 --> 06:44.321
Hey! I mean, that was
kind of hot, but...

06:45.823 --> 06:47.407
- Oh, God, they found us.
- Huh?

06:50.327 --> 06:52.037
Nobody move.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.045
Scanlan!

07:04.383 --> 07:06.301
- Get off me!
- Will you hold still,

07:06.385 --> 07:07.886
you twerp?
I don't want to stab you.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.555
Ah, whatever.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.600
Gross.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.521
Oh. How bad is it?

07:17.521 --> 07:19.690
- Could be worse.
- But how?!

07:19.690 --> 07:21.817
Could be my arm.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.669
You doing okay back there?

07:40.669 --> 07:42.087
Not dead yet.

07:42.171 --> 07:44.256
In fact, we make
a pretty good team.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.094
Ah, balls.

07:49.178 --> 07:50.721
- Bull's-eye.
- Hmm.

07:50.721 --> 07:51.889
We need a way out.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.017
Heads up.

08:00.606 --> 08:03.317
Oh.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.903
Holy shit!

08:10.032 --> 08:13.994
Whitestone ain't worth this.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.125
They're losing heart, Percy.
Say something to them.

08:20.209 --> 08:23.629
I can't. Julius was supposed
to rule, not me.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.798
Julius is gone, and I've been
with the Briarwoods for years.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.425
No one trusts me.

08:28.425 --> 08:32.304
You are next in line--
the long lost de Rolo.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.972
Little help?

08:34.056 --> 08:35.182
Ah.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.558
Scanlan?

08:36.642 --> 08:40.354
I'm no Pike.
This is way beyond me.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.357
Necrosis. You'll lose the arm
within the hour.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.858
The hour? What?!

08:44.942 --> 08:47.236
No, no, I need this arm
for, like... stuff.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.238
Hey, Scanman, you want me
to whack it off?

08:49.238 --> 08:50.822
Yeah, you may have to
if I lose it!

08:50.906 --> 08:52.324
Okay. Hold still!

08:52.324 --> 08:54.159
No! No! Stop! Last resort.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.661
We don't have time for this.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.873
Well, shit.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.501
Let's be anywhere but here.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.887
Okay, this is nice.

09:13.971 --> 09:17.432
Maybe we just live
in this alley for... forever?

09:17.516 --> 09:20.060
Why did I say that?

09:27.109 --> 09:29.903
The bag.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.242
- Yeah, I don't mean to rush you.
- Then don't.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.372
We get it. You're smart.
Just do something!

09:59.850 --> 10:02.102
Holy shit!

10:02.102 --> 10:03.645
Hey, do that again.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.147
Wish I could.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.523
Sadly, it's still
a work in progress.

10:07.816 --> 10:10.485
The fuck?!

10:10.569 --> 10:14.489
Giants, lay waste to them!

10:17.159 --> 10:19.619
Scatter! Regroup
at the Sun Tree!

10:22.331 --> 10:24.708
Miscreant!

10:24.708 --> 10:27.836
You and I have
unfinished business.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.838
Uh, who? Me?

10:29.838 --> 10:31.923
Perhaps you are confused.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.759
We gnomes all look alike,
don't you know?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.470
You know, on second glance,

10:36.470 --> 10:38.972
I do recognize...
Lightning!

10:40.474 --> 10:42.392
Did you really think

10:42.476 --> 10:45.687
I would not adapt
from our previous encounter?

10:45.771 --> 10:47.189
Um, no?

10:49.900 --> 10:52.069
Hmm?

10:56.615 --> 10:58.450
Assault from all points!

11:06.375 --> 11:08.418
You and me,
just like old times.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.420
That desperate, are we?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.966
You joke, but back then,
we could take on the world.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.261
My men would be honored
to fight alongside a de Rolo

11:18.345 --> 11:20.639
if you would only tell them.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.641
Unlikely.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.601
Although, I did keep
a smelly son of a cook

11:24.601 --> 11:26.269
from being executed.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.230
Oh, that was you?
I remember some gangly twat

11:28.230 --> 11:29.731
yapping at me through the bars.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.233
Oh.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.734
Come here, you little shit.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.904
You're one to talk.
You've got enough meat on you...

11:35.904 --> 11:37.447
Scanlan, behind you!

11:39.616 --> 11:42.452
Oh, no. No, no, no!

11:43.829 --> 11:45.997
Ah.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.257
Huh.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.300
No.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.052
Archie.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.598
Archie's down!

12:03.682 --> 12:05.642
Fall back!

12:05.642 --> 12:07.727
Shit!

12:07.811 --> 12:10.105
He's gone, Percy. Come on!

12:16.820 --> 12:18.196
Just keep coming.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.994
I've got this.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.662
Everyone stay back.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.880
Damn.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.090
No. No, come on, please.

12:37.174 --> 12:38.842
I need more.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.241
Kiki!

13:03.325 --> 13:04.826
Where did that come from?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.578
Not really sure.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.914
Have I mentioned you're amazing?

13:08.914 --> 13:10.373
Yes.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.501
Yes, she's the tits.
We still have to go!

13:34.439 --> 13:37.859
Archie... he didn't make it.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.861
We heard.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.531
Now it's your turn to lead them.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.241
It can't be me, Cassandra.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.035
I'm not a leader. I ran.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.787
But you're here now.

13:48.787 --> 13:51.331
Yours wasn't the only life
shattered that day.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.251
We're all here.
The time is now.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.336
No one else can do this.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.428
I am Lord Percival

14:05.512 --> 14:08.473
Fredrickstein von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III!

14:08.557 --> 14:12.477
On the day
the Briarwoods took Whitestone,

14:12.561 --> 14:14.437
I watched my family die.

14:14.521 --> 14:18.858
Despite my desire
for vengeance, I fled.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.236
And fear kept me from my home.

14:21.236 --> 14:24.155
We have all lost.

14:24.239 --> 14:27.033
But Archie never feared,
never wavered.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.953
He willingly gave his life
for all of us.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.997
For Whitestone.

14:31.997 --> 14:34.249
His sacrifice,

14:34.249 --> 14:35.959
your sacrifice

14:35.959 --> 14:39.879
and the sacrifice of my family
shall not be in vain.

14:39.963 --> 14:44.092
Today is for Archie,
for the de Rolos,

14:44.092 --> 14:45.760
for Whitestone!

14:52.851 --> 14:56.730
Let's kill fucking everything!

15:02.444 --> 15:04.571
Leave none standing!

15:18.627 --> 15:22.380
Grog! Damn it!

15:22.464 --> 15:24.758
Oh, worst time
to have performance issues.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.176
Aah.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.974
Hey.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.853
You... you know I'm in love
with you, right?

15:36.853 --> 15:38.605
Uh...

15:40.607 --> 15:43.526
Wait. What?! Now?!

15:43.610 --> 15:46.780
I mean, this is,
like, the worst time!

15:46.780 --> 15:48.448
Come on!

15:53.286 --> 15:54.704
Pull back!

15:54.788 --> 15:56.623
Come on, up the tree!

15:56.623 --> 15:58.667
It was an honor
fighting with you.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.460
It was a valiant effort, friend.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.384
- Huh?
- Huh?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.231
Sup?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.483
Pike?!

16:23.483 --> 16:25.819
Holy shit!

16:25.819 --> 16:28.071
Huh. You look...

16:28.071 --> 16:29.906
like an angel.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.249
Marry me?

16:39.249 --> 16:41.418
Okay, let's do it. Right now.

16:41.418 --> 16:44.087
Wait. What? Uh, seriously?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.922
No.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.924
But it's good
to see you too, Scanlan.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.093
Hey, everyone, uh, I'm... Oh.

16:50.093 --> 16:53.763
I missed you so much.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.349
Ooh. Pike?

16:56.433 --> 17:00.186
You're glowing
and kind of buzzing?

17:00.270 --> 17:01.813
Are you dead?

17:01.813 --> 17:04.357
- Astral projection.
- Your ass what?

17:04.441 --> 17:07.569
I'm here, buddy, but my body
is back at the temple.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.029
I still felt
that bear hug, though,

17:10.113 --> 17:12.073
which definitely hurt.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.829
Listen, how about
we talk about it

17:17.829 --> 17:21.040
after we murder
these unholy fucks?

17:52.405 --> 17:53.990
This has gotten out of hand.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.492
I'm going to the front.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.910
And risk everything?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.870
You're too valuable.

18:00.497 --> 18:04.083
No. We must
accelerate our plans.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.294
But I thought
it was too soon?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.463
They've left us no choice.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.927
Another confounding gnome?

18:13.927 --> 18:17.013
Hey, look at that. Whole team's
back together again.

18:17.013 --> 18:18.681
Vex, give me a lift.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.226
I want to try something stupid.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.695
Scanlan. Hand!

18:34.322 --> 18:36.074
<i>♪ The legend's back,
oh, yes, he's back</i> ♪

18:36.074 --> 18:37.951
Huh?

18:37.951 --> 18:40.620
<i>Hop on, I'll give you a ride ♪</i>

18:40.620 --> 18:45.458
<i>Get ready to fly! ♪</i>

18:46.793 --> 18:48.837
Oh, gods.

18:48.837 --> 18:52.632
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.467
Fuck this!

18:54.551 --> 18:55.885
You motherfuckers!

19:01.349 --> 19:04.102
Mine fell first.

19:04.102 --> 19:05.937
Nuh-uh!

19:05.937 --> 19:07.730
This cannot be happening.

19:07.814 --> 19:12.277
It's preposterous,
unthinkable, incompre...

19:12.277 --> 19:15.446
Oh. Fuck this.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.448
Vedmire!

19:17.532 --> 19:20.535
That was for Archie.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.788
Congratulations, Vedmire.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.915
Your name isn't on my list.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.709
Instead, you'll answer

19:27.709 --> 19:29.836
- to the people of Whitestone.
- Huh?

19:29.836 --> 19:33.756
And may they show you all
the mercy you showed them.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.717
You stay away.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.218
You get your hands off me.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.220
Get off me,
you fucking ballbag.

19:39.304 --> 19:43.725
Get off...

19:48.021 --> 19:49.522
Huh?

19:49.606 --> 19:52.233
For Whitestone!

19:52.317 --> 19:54.903
Yennen? It isn't safe here.

19:54.903 --> 19:57.572
The Dawnfather called,
and we answered.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.241
I think I know a sign
when I see one.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.918
- Hey, uh, what's she doing?
- Watch.

20:19.177 --> 20:23.139
May your weapons strike with the
divine virtue of the Everlight.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.226
Now go crush some fucking heads!

20:34.192 --> 20:36.736
Our people can
handle it from here.

20:36.736 --> 20:40.782
Go, Percival. Take back
what is rightfully yours.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.659
I don't know how to thank you.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.078
The Dawnfather has found life
in you.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.246
Use his gift wisely.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.835
Well, fearless leader, lead.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.934
With the Pale Guard
protecting the castle gate,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.852
the best way in is...

21:09.936 --> 21:12.689
Our hidden tunnel.

21:12.689 --> 21:16.401
It was good enough to hide
from nannies and tutors.

21:16.401 --> 21:18.987
And know-it-all older brothers.

21:18.987 --> 21:22.448
Cass,

21:22.532 --> 21:24.617
I'm so sorry.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.412
I wish I could go back
and do things differently.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.123
I know.

21:38.715 --> 21:42.927
Percy.
Your castle is, um... nice.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.762
This is the dungeon, Keyleth.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.890
The Briarwoods
will be found elsewhere.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.519
Is someone there?

21:51.519 --> 21:53.271
- What?
- Hmm?

21:53.271 --> 21:56.774
Did I hear you say you were
looking for the Briarwoods?

21:56.858 --> 21:58.860
Are you friend or foe?

21:58.860 --> 22:02.572
Foe. Of Delilah
and Sylas, at least.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.949
I can take you to them

22:05.033 --> 22:07.035
if you free me.

22:19.422 --> 22:22.759
This is the only freedom
I offer you.

22:22.759 --> 22:24.802
