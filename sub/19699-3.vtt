WEBVTT

00:01.218 --> 00:03.351
My name is H.G. Wells.

00:03.394 --> 00:05.266
My friend John
is Jack the Ripper.

00:05.309 --> 00:08.051
He's escaped from 1893
in my time machine,

00:08.095 --> 00:11.054
and I am the only one
who can catch him.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.883
I want the key
and the time machine now.

00:13.926 --> 00:15.406
Well, I can't oblige, John.

00:15.450 --> 00:18.540
What if I told you that George
is really H.G. Wells?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.324
I would say
you've lost your damn mind.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.109
H.G. Wells --
he's in New York.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.588
He came
in his time machine.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.373
You can stop this all
from happening.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.288
I'm Brooke.
I'm a neuropathologist.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.073
I'd be honored
if you'd join me for a drink.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.901
You and I were always
supposed to meet.

00:31.944 --> 00:35.122
I am completely blinded by you,
Miss Walker.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.953
No!

00:40.997 --> 00:43.652
Who's the guy?I don't know, but I've
seen this man before.
He was following me.

00:43.695 --> 00:46.437
Who are you?I'm someone who's waited
a long time to meet you.

01:18.339 --> 01:21.037
I brought you something
to help clear your head.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.345
Just apple juice.
It's organic, fresh pressed.

01:24.388 --> 01:25.955
Your system must be in shock

01:25.998 --> 01:27.348
after all the preservatives
they put in food these days.

01:29.219 --> 01:33.136
Well, that made a mess.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.442
You'll regret this.

01:34.485 --> 01:35.878
Regret drugging you?

01:35.921 --> 01:38.098
After you tried to stab me
with a kitchen knife?

01:38.141 --> 01:40.100
Who are you?

01:40.143 --> 01:44.452
I'm someone who knows
you're Jack the Ripper.

01:44.495 --> 01:49.892
And you escaped to 2017
in H.G. Wells' time machine.

01:49.935 --> 01:53.461
I also know
that Mr. Wells is being aided

01:53.504 --> 01:57.769
by a distant relative --
Vanessa Anders.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.510
But you're all alone.

01:59.554 --> 02:03.427
Something tells me
you could use a friend.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.213
You have to trust me.

02:06.256 --> 02:10.304
Trust you?

02:15.744 --> 02:19.965
I'll come back when
you're feeling more yourself.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.238
Hey there, big boy.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.284
Click on it now.
Show me how big you are.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.677
Oh.

03:19.721 --> 03:22.376
Check out my live cam.

03:22.419 --> 03:23.899
Good morning.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.467
Ah, y-yes it is.
Good morning.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.643
Uh...

03:28.686 --> 03:30.297
What are you doing?

03:30.340 --> 03:34.301
Attempting to master the
Internet and failing miserably.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.651
I really enjoyed
last night.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.522
We were almost killed.Right.

03:38.566 --> 03:41.873
No,
the part after that.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.005
As did I.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.746
It wasn't too forward,
was it?

03:44.789 --> 03:46.661
Because I forget
you're from 1893,

03:46.704 --> 03:48.706
and things
were more formal back then.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.795
And I didn't want
to come across as --

03:50.839 --> 03:53.320
I don't know how you used to
call it -- a harlot.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.626
Which you are not,
I-I assure you.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.499
Not to sound old-fashioned,
but I do struggle

03:58.542 --> 04:00.414
with the ease with which
men and women

04:00.457 --> 04:02.198
give themselves
to each other.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.941
Sexual mores of today are quite
baffling as it's all...

04:05.984 --> 04:07.508
it's all so very, uh...

04:07.551 --> 04:08.944
Casual?
No.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.338
It's routine.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.817
Lacking in romance.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.516
See, in my day,
passion and desire --

04:15.559 --> 04:19.781
they were -- they were the true
result of yearning for a woman.

04:19.824 --> 04:23.001
The longing that fills you head
and clouds every thought

04:23.045 --> 04:26.135
as you patiently await for her
to walk through the door

04:26.178 --> 04:27.484
and say "Good morning."

04:34.274 --> 04:37.538
Good morning, Jane.
Morning.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.976
Good morning.

04:41.019 --> 04:42.630
Morning.
Morning.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.371
We have information
about the man who attacked you.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.981
His name was Chad Holland.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.723
He had a place in the Bronx,
lived alone, never married,

04:48.766 --> 04:50.725
worked odd jobs,
history of trouble,

04:50.768 --> 04:52.553
but mostly petty crime.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.511
But nothing to explain
why he was trying to kill me?

04:54.555 --> 04:56.513
How he knows
about me and John?

04:56.557 --> 04:58.080
I take it
John still hasn't called?

04:58.123 --> 05:00.082
No.
And it's way past his deadline.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.736
I've known John
for many years.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.694
If he hasn't reached out,
then something's happened.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.783
Maybe he had a run-in
with Chad Holland.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.090
Is there any way to access
Chad Holland's residence?

05:08.133 --> 05:09.874
We can try.
I'll drive you.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.180
Great.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.573
I have some business
to deal with.

05:12.616 --> 05:14.879
You'll let me know
if you find out anything.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.581
Honey.
Have you been waiting long?

05:20.624 --> 05:23.105
No, I just got here.
Hi.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.672
So where's Wells?

05:24.715 --> 05:26.195
I was hoping to get a chance
to talk to him this morning.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.631
He stepped out for a bit.
He'll be back.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.285
My head is still spinning.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.723
I can't believe
he's the real H.G. Wells.

05:32.767 --> 05:33.855
How long
does he plan on staying?

05:33.898 --> 05:35.291
I'm not sure.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.511
It all depends
on finding John Stevenson.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.077
It's crazy.

05:39.121 --> 05:42.690
It's right out of
some science fiction story.

05:42.733 --> 05:46.084
Written by H.G. Wells
maybe.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.826
A real
working time machine.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.480
Do you know
how many people would kill

05:50.524 --> 05:51.612
for something like that?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.440
Are you sure
it's secure here?

05:53.483 --> 05:56.312
I trust my team, and I've
installed a security system

05:56.356 --> 05:58.488
that requires
key-card access.
Good.

05:58.532 --> 06:01.752
So, uh, what about
the war veteran charity tonight?

06:01.796 --> 06:03.406
Should we cancel?
No.

06:03.450 --> 06:06.366
It's just the board members,
and they're all friends of mine.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.977
And they're here
to meet you.

06:09.020 --> 06:10.631
Wait,
you set this up for me?

06:10.674 --> 06:12.154
You are running
for Senate.

06:12.197 --> 06:14.461
And a cocktail party
full potential donors

06:14.504 --> 06:15.723
never hurt a campaign.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.333
Babe, you didn't have to
do that.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.943
I insist.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.424
I've been so distracted
by H.G.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.731
And tonight,
you're my priority.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.254
Come here.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.187
Thank you so much
for you trouble.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.536
We promise to be quick.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.757
You're just yummy.
How did you know Chad?

06:49.800 --> 06:53.325
Uh, we were friends.
His family asked us to come.

06:53.369 --> 06:54.979
I didn't know
he had any family.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.590
Hell, I didn't know
he had any friends.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.548
Guy gave me the creeps.

07:00.071 --> 07:02.509
Ah.
You're too kind.

07:02.552 --> 07:04.989
I'm a sucker for a Brit.
My father was a Brit.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.861
He came over
after World War II.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.819
There was more than one?

07:08.863 --> 07:10.473
Thank you...so much.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.301
We really appreciate this.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.454
Chad was
a little obsessed.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.960
He was following
both of us.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.180
How did he know
that we would be here?

08:07.312 --> 08:10.011
This would be easier if we knew
what we were looking for.

08:36.559 --> 08:37.865
Is that the same emblem?

08:37.908 --> 08:41.216
It's the one I put
in my letter to Vanessa.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.348
What is that?

08:43.392 --> 08:45.742
It appears to be
coordinates.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.495
Hi there.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.890
Don't suppose
I could have my clothes?

09:10.637 --> 09:12.334
Feeling better?

09:14.641 --> 09:18.340
And will you
behave yourself?

09:18.383 --> 09:20.995
It's not my wish to keep you
locked up in here, John.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.824
I did it
out of necessity.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.000
I want to us to learn
to trust each other.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.742
Trust works both ways,
Brooke.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.927
May I?
It's chilly in here.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.323
So, where are we?

09:45.367 --> 09:48.979
Uh, my basement lab,
where I work.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.547
So you were telling the truth
about being a doctor.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
Biotechnology research.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.464
Neurology,
genetics, biochemistry.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.857
My father was a scientist.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.946
He inspired me
to continue his research.

09:58.989 --> 10:02.079
Fascinating.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.561
Really?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.390
I was afraid the Ripper
would find me boring.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.913
Boring?

10:09.957 --> 10:12.829
A little romp in the bedroom,
syringe to the neck,

10:12.873 --> 10:16.441
awaken naked and tied up
in a laboratory --

10:16.485 --> 10:20.402
Boring is the very least
of what you are, my darling.

10:20.445 --> 10:23.057
So, what is all of this?

10:23.100 --> 10:24.667
Gene therapy.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.714
I'm working on ways to improve
human neurological function.

10:27.757 --> 10:31.892
You're looking at your own DNA,
which is your genetic makeup.

10:31.935 --> 10:34.634
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

10:34.677 --> 10:38.115
They'd just begun to study it
in my day.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.683
So you want
to analyze my brain?

10:40.727 --> 10:42.859
You might not like
what you find.

10:42.903 --> 10:47.124
Oh, I doubt that,
John Leslie Stevenson.

10:47.168 --> 10:50.388
Born 1863 in London
to Elizabeth Stevenson,

10:50.432 --> 10:51.738
a street prostitute.

10:51.781 --> 10:53.261
No surprise there.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.872
No father, but you fought
your way to Oxford

10:55.916 --> 10:57.352
to the top of your class.

10:57.395 --> 11:00.268
Esteemed surgeon by day,
killer by night.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.270
How do you know
so much about me?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.185
I know things about you

11:04.228 --> 11:06.274
that you don't even know
about yourself.

11:06.317 --> 11:09.277
Like the fact
that you have a son.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.759
I can assure you
I do not have a son.

11:12.802 --> 11:15.631
Henry Ayers --
born to Pauline Ayers,

11:15.675 --> 11:18.112
a nurse you met in 1891
in Paris.

11:18.155 --> 11:21.985
Do you remember her?

11:22.029 --> 11:23.683
Impossible.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.776
I want to conduct some tests.
Nothing too invasive.

11:29.819 --> 11:32.474
A controlled environment
to study your psychopathy.

11:32.517 --> 11:34.302
What do I get?

11:34.345 --> 11:36.260
The time machine,
of course.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.827
Do you know where it is?

11:37.871 --> 11:40.177
It's under lock and key,
courtesy of Vanessa Anders.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.049
It's also where
your little friend, H.G. Wells,

11:42.092 --> 11:43.833
has been staying
since he's been in New York.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.792
I can get it for you.

11:45.835 --> 11:50.840
Yes, if I submit
to being your lab rat.

11:50.884 --> 11:56.498
I want you to start thinking
of me as a friend.

11:56.541 --> 11:59.022
Just a friend?

11:59.066 --> 12:01.329
With a little extra.

12:01.372 --> 12:05.942
You know, there's a crazy killer
on every corner today, Brooke.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.291
Why me?

12:07.335 --> 12:11.818
Because there's only one
Jack the Ripper.

12:16.387 --> 12:17.824
Were you able
to find out anything

12:17.867 --> 12:19.347
about the coordinates
from Chad's apartment?

12:19.390 --> 12:20.783
Yes and no.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.698
The longitude and latitude
takes us here

12:22.742 --> 12:25.179
to a residential area
of Glen Cove, Long Island.

12:25.222 --> 12:29.270
These next numbers appear to be
a date -- September 15, 1980.

12:29.313 --> 12:30.837
What about these numbers?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.882
It's the time --
1:42 p.m.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.537
So, Chad was trying
to get to the time machine

12:35.580 --> 12:38.322
to go to Long Island on
a specific date and time.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.368
Why?
He said he had to
stop something.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.805
In 1980?
Well, perhaps
an event occurred in the area,

12:42.849 --> 12:44.459
something
with significance.

12:44.502 --> 12:47.549
From what I can find,
the day was rather uneventful.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.638
I've searched the archives
of the local paper.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.162
The biggest news was a bake sale
at the county courthouse.

12:52.206 --> 12:55.122
We're missing something.We know I'm important
to Chad Holland --

12:55.165 --> 12:56.471
as is John
for that matter.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.951
We still haven't heard
from him.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.996
There's a mystery afoot
that we're not aware of.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.825
I have to go.
It's all we have.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.828
You're going to 1980?Yes, to Glen Cove, is it?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.699
How's my wardrobe?

13:07.743 --> 13:09.876
Wait.
I'm coming with you.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.226
It isn't safe.
I have no idea what's in store.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.403
I'm a historian.
I know the '80s. You don't.

13:15.446 --> 13:17.492
Let me help you.
I want to come.

13:25.935 --> 13:28.155
You okay?
Huh?
Yeah, I'm excited.

13:28.198 --> 13:29.460
This is not fear.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.245
It's a little fear
with excitement.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.334
But I'm ready.
Let's do this.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.049
Oh.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.245
So...

14:15.289 --> 14:17.073
this is 1980.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.249
Why would the coordinates bring
us to the middle of nowhere?

14:19.293 --> 14:21.295
Do you hear that?

14:23.166 --> 14:26.561
It's coming
from over there.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.004
Oh, here we are.

14:37.528 --> 14:38.703
Looks like a party.

14:38.747 --> 14:40.401
It's an impressive house.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.319
It's a yuppie barbecue.

14:45.362 --> 14:48.539
Oh.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.627
Is this your ball?

14:49.671 --> 14:50.628
Yes.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.413
Here we are.Thank you.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.631
You talk funny.

14:53.675 --> 14:54.545
I'm from England.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.983
Vanessa, come inside.

14:57.026 --> 15:00.421
Vanessa Maria Anders,
now!

15:04.991 --> 15:06.601
Was that...

15:06.644 --> 15:10.518
Vanessa. Yes.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.041
We're at
her parents' house.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.093
What does Chad have to do
with Vanessa's family?

15:20.136 --> 15:21.311
Why would he want
to come here?

15:21.355 --> 15:22.922
Well,
the man wanted me dead,

15:22.965 --> 15:24.184
and Vanessa and her parents
are my descendants.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.359
Maybe they were
his targets, too.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.274
In 1980?

15:27.317 --> 15:29.102
We'll have a look around,
see what we find.
Wait.

15:29.145 --> 15:30.538
Let's make you a yuppie.

15:30.581 --> 15:32.279
A yuppie?
What's a yuppie?

15:32.322 --> 15:34.977
A young urban professional
with an affluent lifestyle

15:35.021 --> 15:36.805
they like to talk about
endlessly.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.025
Sounds obnoxious.Ah, well,
welcome to the '80s.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.679
Reagan was president.
Greed was good.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.333
Fashion was awful.

15:43.377 --> 15:46.467
It was a time of Spandex,
"Dynasty." I want my MTV.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.208
You want your what?It's a party.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.558
Just say things like "Madonna"
and "Wall Street,"

15:50.601 --> 15:51.776
and you'll fit right in.

15:51.820 --> 15:52.995
Right, got it.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.214
Well, hello there, you two.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.606
I don't believe I've seen you

15:55.650 --> 15:57.304
at one of the Anders' shindigs
before.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.697
Here, I thought I knew all
of Courtney and David's friends.

15:59.741 --> 16:01.395
We just moved
to the neighborhood.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.919
I'm Angelina,
and this is my husband, Brad.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.834
Oh, I'm Bethanny.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.575
My hubby's around here
somewhere --

16:07.618 --> 16:09.359
probably at the bar
not getting me a refill.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.972
Uh, you said
you were new to the area?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.365
Yes, we just bought
a place down the road.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.150
On Wall Street.

16:17.193 --> 16:19.326
Well, it's a shame you didn't
wait a little longer to buy.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.936
All of this
could've been yours.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.285
The Anders' house
is for sale?

16:22.329 --> 16:24.157
Well, unofficially.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.551
I hear David's company
is not doing well.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.945
Oh, that's terrible.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.251
May I refresh that
for you?

16:31.294 --> 16:34.776
Mm. Such a gentleman.
Amaretto sour.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.126
I'll come with you, honey.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.259
I was really hoping
to get to know the guy.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.912
When will they be back?That's up to them.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.610
They're controlling
the machine manually.

16:42.653 --> 16:46.266
Ah. Now, do they come back at
the same time as when they left?

16:46.309 --> 16:47.789
How's that work?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.225
They travel in real time

16:49.269 --> 16:50.444
so as to not tear
the fabric of the timeline.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.968
Is that like
time-travel science or...?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.710
Martin, where did they go?

16:55.753 --> 16:57.190
Glen Cove, Long Island,
1980.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.585
Show me.

17:01.629 --> 17:04.110
I want to see the exact location
of Chad's coordinates.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.241
Uh, you got it.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.298
That's the backyard
of my childhood home.

17:18.341 --> 17:21.040
Whoa.

17:23.085 --> 17:26.654
Let me know
the moment they get back.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.788
Don't look now, but I think
you're about to meet

17:30.832 --> 17:32.964
another one
of your family members.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.444
Oh.

17:34.488 --> 17:37.534
Hello.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.884
How old are you?I'm 3.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.148
You're 3? Wow.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.497
She likes you.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.499
I'm sorry,
I don't believe we've met.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.761
I'm Courtney Anders.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.502
You have
such a lovely home.

17:48.545 --> 17:51.070
Thank you.
Are you friends with my husband?

17:51.113 --> 17:53.376
As a matter of fact --We are friends
with Bethanny.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.204
She told us
so much about you two.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.640
Oh, really.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.860
What did that gossip
have to say?

17:58.903 --> 18:02.037
David, hon, you have a guest.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.391
If you'll excuse me.

18:12.265 --> 18:15.703
Welcome to our home.
It was very nice meeting you.

18:15.746 --> 18:18.488
Lovely to meet you,
as well.

18:18.532 --> 18:19.924
Bye.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.926
Oh, we mustn't interact
so blatantly.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.580
Remember,
we cannot influence, obstruct,

18:23.624 --> 18:25.365
or do anything
that can alter the timeline.

18:25.408 --> 18:29.456
We must observe only.You can't just barge in...

18:29.499 --> 18:33.155
So why don't we
observe that?

18:33.199 --> 18:36.376
Wait here.
I'll be right back.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.552
Who's that man?

18:42.251 --> 18:45.907
Jane, that satchel.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.257
It was in
Chad's apartment.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.001
Radical gene therapy fails when
the brain rejects the new DNA.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.307
It doesn't want to change,

18:54.350 --> 18:55.917
but my father discovered
a better method,

18:55.960 --> 18:57.266
and I've perfected it.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.355
And once this new DNA
is inside the brain,

18:59.399 --> 19:02.576
you can manipulate
the chemistry in the brain

19:02.619 --> 19:04.752
to control
how people think?

19:04.795 --> 19:06.841
You're catching on.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.064
Do you want to study me
or change me?

19:13.108 --> 19:15.066
Don't you want to change?

19:15.110 --> 19:18.983
Not in the least.Oh. Think about it.

19:19.027 --> 19:23.205
Your impulse to kill, that
blinding rage that consumes you.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.382
Don't you want to control it
just --

19:26.426 --> 19:28.645
just a teensy bit?

19:28.689 --> 19:31.387
Your son, Henry Ayers --
He was a doctor like you

19:31.431 --> 19:33.607
before he died in Paris
in 1918.

19:33.650 --> 19:38.133
I wonder if he inherited
your killer instincts.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.830
And aren't you curious?

19:39.874 --> 19:42.137
If I cared at all, I would have
paid better attention

19:42.181 --> 19:43.443
to the women I slept with.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.627
Why am I so important to you,
Brooke?

19:53.670 --> 19:55.585
Hm?

19:58.980 --> 20:02.375
What are you
not telling me?

20:02.418 --> 20:06.205
I have the answers
to all your questions.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.555
But you need to be patient.

20:08.598 --> 20:11.210
Not a very patient man,
Brooke.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.733
You of all people
should know that.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.302
No, stop.

20:52.076 --> 20:53.817
What the hell was that?

21:01.347 --> 21:03.479
That's
the exact same satchel

21:03.523 --> 21:05.220
we found
in Chad's apartment.And why was he arguing
with Vanessa's father?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.177
We need to find out
who he is.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.702
I know just the person.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.530
Bethanny!

21:10.573 --> 21:14.360
Oh, my God.
It's my two new best friends.

21:14.403 --> 21:16.753
Did you forget
my amaretto sour?

21:16.797 --> 21:18.233
I'm afraid so.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.062
Bethanny, who is that guy
over there?

21:21.105 --> 21:24.500
Oh, him?
He's married.

21:24.544 --> 21:25.545
Oh. And so am I.

21:25.588 --> 21:26.763
To me.

21:26.807 --> 21:28.548
I'm just having
a little fun.

21:28.591 --> 21:31.333
What else can you tell us
about that guy?

21:31.377 --> 21:32.769
His name is Robert.

21:32.813 --> 21:35.729
Uh, 30s, grew up here,
married five years.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.208
They travel a lot.

21:37.252 --> 21:40.037
Beautiful wife,
but she's cheating on him.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.212
Can't really blame her,
though.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.910
He's a bit odd.

21:42.953 --> 21:46.348
No divorce yet, but I give them
another...two months max.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.089
My God.
Imagine the possibilities

21:48.132 --> 21:50.483
if you use your memory
for something significant.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.962
And his last name?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.748
Holland.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.010
Does he have a child?

21:56.053 --> 22:00.057
Yeah, a little boy.
Chad.

22:00.101 --> 22:01.885
Oh, there's Jennifer.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.887
Look at
that horrendous perm.

22:03.931 --> 22:06.412
Hey, Jenny!

22:06.455 --> 22:08.109
Hi!

22:08.152 --> 22:10.633
So Chad's father
is connected to the Anders.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.069
But how?
And why now?

22:12.113 --> 22:14.071
Why is today
so important to Chad?

22:24.386 --> 22:27.171
Come with me, this way.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.533
Come on.

22:43.971 --> 22:47.453
I think he needs
another 8 milligrams of Zofran.

22:47.496 --> 22:48.454
Please watch him.

22:53.197 --> 22:54.982
Some sort of experiment?

22:57.071 --> 22:57.941
Eh.

23:01.031 --> 23:03.817
Tell me -- does you weapon
administer a form of anesthesia?

23:03.860 --> 23:07.037
Don't worry about it.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.262
My word.
Sure she's okay alone with him?

23:19.267 --> 23:20.790
Aaah!

23:37.459 --> 23:39.026
Good God, man!

24:13.713 --> 24:16.629
Stop.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.892
Don't do this, John.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.676
I can help you.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.112
I don't need your help.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.940
If you want to help somebody,
help yourself

24:23.984 --> 24:27.901
'cause you, my dear,
are as mad as a bag of ferrets.

24:27.944 --> 24:29.468
This is a real gun.

24:29.511 --> 24:32.340
Well, you've made it quite clear
you need my alive.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.255
Goodbye, love.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.875
It was stupid for you
to come to my house.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.747
I have the files
for all the drug research.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.140
Do you want them or not?Let me see.

24:56.407 --> 24:59.498
You have no idea what I went
through to get these.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.806
So do we have a deal?

25:03.850 --> 25:06.809
Is this everything
on Project Utopia?

25:06.853 --> 25:08.115
That's what you asked for,
isn't it?

25:08.158 --> 25:10.117
Amazing.
Can you be implicated?

25:10.160 --> 25:12.772
I'm not stupid.
I covered my tracks.

25:12.815 --> 25:15.470
Get these drugs
on the marketplace first.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.298
He'll never be able to prove
they were stolen.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.387
I'm gonna make
so much money.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.563
Speaking of money,
where's mine?

25:21.607 --> 25:24.566
I wasn't expecting you
to just show up here today.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.221
This is all the cash
I had in the house.

25:27.264 --> 25:29.745
This isn't
what we talked about.

25:29.789 --> 25:32.313
We had an agreement.Yes, I know.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.402
And I will get you
the rest of the money.

25:34.445 --> 25:36.578
No, you don't get this
until I get all the money.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.972
Don't be unreasonable.
This will bring the money.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.800
You know who I am.I thought I did.

25:40.843 --> 25:44.630
Let me know
when you have the money.

26:40.294 --> 26:42.035
David?

26:42.078 --> 26:44.037
What are you doing back here?

26:49.912 --> 26:51.305
Go!

27:22.771 --> 27:25.600
Go, go.
Get out of here.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.758
We should have done something
back there.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.455
Vanessa's father killed
Chad's father.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.718
You know as well as I do
we cannot change history.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.459
The consequences would be
too great.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.722
Do you think Vanessa has
any idea what her father did?

28:00.766 --> 28:01.941
I'm betting she doesn't.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.856
So how were the '80s?

28:03.899 --> 28:05.466
Um...
Um...

28:05.509 --> 28:08.077
Hair -- lots of hair.

28:08.121 --> 28:11.777
Okay. Well, Vanessa wants
to see you guys ASAP.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.430
Right,
thank you, Martin.

28:13.474 --> 28:15.476
Need anything else from me
tonight?

28:15.519 --> 28:16.782
No, we're all set.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.219
All righty, then.
See you tomorrow.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.660
What are we
gonna tell Vanessa?

28:25.704 --> 28:27.618
Well, the truth.
She has a right to know.

28:27.662 --> 28:29.185
I don't think
that's a good idea.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.361
Well, regardless,
Vanessa and I made an agreement

28:31.405 --> 28:32.798
to be truthful
to one another.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.756
Right, but sometimes
the truth can be hurtful.

28:34.800 --> 28:36.236
But perhaps necessary.Wait.

28:36.279 --> 28:37.933
Before we say anything
to Vanessa,

28:37.977 --> 28:40.414
why don't we find out
a little more on Robert Holland,

28:40.457 --> 28:42.677
Project Utopia,
and how it connects to Anders?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.862
And there was
the second one.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.692
Excuse me.

29:02.610 --> 29:04.655
Let's talk.

29:04.699 --> 29:08.268
So, I understand
you went to my childhood home.

29:08.311 --> 29:10.400
Yes, uh, coordinates
from Chad Holland's apartment

29:10.444 --> 29:11.924
led us there.Did you see me?

29:11.967 --> 29:13.969
Yes, we -- we met briefly.
You don't remember?

29:14.013 --> 29:15.144
No, I was only 3.

29:16.319 --> 29:17.756
You were
an adorable child.

29:20.584 --> 29:23.500
Did you see my parents?

29:23.544 --> 29:27.069
David and Courtney.Yes. They were having
a garden party.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.637
They were very gracious.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.206
You know,
I can't believe it.

29:33.249 --> 29:36.775
What connection does my family
have to Chad Holland?

29:39.778 --> 29:40.953
Uh, we don't know.

29:40.996 --> 29:43.216
Unfortunately,
it was a dead end.

29:43.259 --> 29:45.609
Well, at least
you got to see my parents

29:45.653 --> 29:47.698
and meet some more
of your family.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.918
We did overhear your father
talk about his work.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.485
A Project Utopia?

29:51.528 --> 29:55.445
Utopia? I don't know
of any Project Utopia.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.665
I don't even know
why he would use the word.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.059
I found it odd myself.
I was hoping you might know.

30:00.102 --> 30:03.062
Does raise an eyebrow.Yes, it does.

30:03.105 --> 30:04.411
You know, I keep
all of my father's research

30:04.454 --> 30:05.847
on digital files.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.067
I'll look into it
as soon as the party's over.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.590
Of course.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.551
You did the right thing.

31:36.851 --> 31:39.854
Can I help you?

31:39.898 --> 31:42.726
Yes.
Yes, you can actually.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.424
I'm looking
for the party.

31:44.467 --> 31:46.165
You got to go back outside
and check in with security.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.428
Okay, thank you.

32:13.061 --> 32:15.542
This one's a keeper. You need
to get him more involved.

32:15.585 --> 32:18.023
Excuse me, ma'am.
Someone is asking for you.

32:18.066 --> 32:21.330
I'll be right back.

32:23.898 --> 32:26.031
Brooke.

32:26.074 --> 32:28.468
What a surprise.
I didn't know you were coming.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.905
Sorry to barge in
without an invitation.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.341
Well,
you're always welcome.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.516
I wish I saw more of you.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.910
Me, too.
Is my brother around?

32:35.954 --> 32:40.045
Yes, he's right over here.
Griffin.

32:40.088 --> 32:42.569
Your sister's here.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.005
We'll talk later.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.834
Brooke. What in the hell
are you doing here?

32:46.877 --> 32:48.618
We need to talk.

32:54.276 --> 32:56.278
Why are you here?
I've been trying to reach you.

32:56.322 --> 32:58.063
John escaped.What happened?

32:58.106 --> 32:59.934
You were supposed to
keep him locked up.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.024
Well, now he's gone, and he
knows where the time machine is.

33:03.068 --> 33:05.244
He's coming here?I don't know.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.245
Maybe.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.508
That's not our only problem.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.945
Wells traveled back
to Glen Cove 1980.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.948
Did he find out
about Utopia?

33:13.992 --> 33:15.341
I don't know.

33:15.384 --> 33:18.083
When need to secure
the time machine -- now.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.607
You want to take it now
in the middle of a fundraiser.

33:20.650 --> 33:24.132
If Wells finds out Robert
Holland sold our father's
research to David Anders,

33:24.176 --> 33:26.265
it's all over.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.528
We need to move.

33:30.486 --> 33:33.620
What is Project Utopia
besides an ironic joke on me?

33:33.663 --> 33:36.101
It was worth killing for.
That we know.

33:36.144 --> 33:37.624
But who did Chad's father
steal it from?

33:37.667 --> 33:39.104
Who invented it?

33:39.147 --> 33:41.541
It must involve me somehow.
Chad knew that.

33:41.584 --> 33:43.630
So did Chad
want the time machine

33:43.673 --> 33:46.981
to go back to 1980 to stop
his father from being killed?

33:47.025 --> 33:50.680
What else could it be?

33:50.724 --> 33:52.160
"Robert L. Holland,

33:52.204 --> 33:54.380
survived by wife, Mary,
and six-month-old son, Chad,

33:54.423 --> 33:56.469
died September 16, 1980,

33:56.512 --> 33:58.123
as a result
of injuries sustained

33:58.166 --> 34:00.125
in an accidental fall
outside his home."

34:00.168 --> 34:01.952
Anders covered it up.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.302
He made it look
like an accident.

34:03.345 --> 34:05.478
And Vanessa has no idea
about any of this.

34:05.521 --> 34:07.654
Explains why her parents
were so charitable.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.222
Can imagine the guilt
was eating them alive.

34:59.749 --> 35:02.143
Project Utopia -- so far,

35:02.187 --> 35:04.537
I've found a spiritual retreat
in New Mexico,

35:04.580 --> 35:07.844
an alt-rock band,
and an African charity.

35:07.888 --> 35:10.717
In our search for answers, all
we've gotten are more questions.

35:10.760 --> 35:14.068
I really have made a mess
of my invention.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.462
Time travel was meant
for research and observation.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.681
I wanted to better the world,
not destroy it.

35:24.687 --> 35:28.517
Whatever is happening,
we'll figure it out.

35:32.782 --> 35:33.914
How do you do that?

35:33.957 --> 35:35.089
Do what?

35:35.133 --> 35:36.960
Fix me with just a kiss.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.530
I know this woman.

35:41.574 --> 35:44.142
There's a document specialist
at the museum.

35:44.185 --> 35:45.578
She can help find anything.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.188
I bet she could help find
Project Utopia.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.755
Can you contact her?

35:48.798 --> 35:51.236
I have her number on my phone.
Let me go get it.

36:34.235 --> 36:38.239
Well, hello, Miss Walker.
Don't you look lovely.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.806
What are you doing here?

36:39.849 --> 36:40.981
Well, you know me.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.504
I hate to miss a party.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.725
You want the time machine.

36:45.768 --> 36:47.466
You know me so well.

36:47.509 --> 36:50.643
But as I'm sure you're aware,
it's behind lock and key.

36:50.686 --> 36:53.472
So, tell me, Jane.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.910
How many people do I have to
hurt to get into that room?

36:59.652 --> 37:02.263
None.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.091
Because I have the key
right here.

37:04.134 --> 37:06.485
Marvelous.

37:11.359 --> 37:12.839
It's John!

37:12.882 --> 37:14.232
He's here!

37:14.275 --> 37:15.363
We have a breach.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.934
Somebody help!

37:20.977 --> 37:23.893
Help! Help!

37:29.856 --> 37:30.857
Are you okay?It's John. He's here.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.208
The time machine.
Yes.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.602
Thank you.

37:38.517 --> 37:40.345
Hey.
Everything okay?

37:40.388 --> 37:41.607
Have you seen Griffin?

37:41.650 --> 37:43.522
Uh, he was just here.

37:43.565 --> 37:46.002
Ms. Anders.
A word, please?

37:46.046 --> 37:48.135
Excuse me.

38:11.463 --> 38:12.507
I know you.

38:26.782 --> 38:27.870
John Stevenson
is in the house.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.220
I know.
Get everybody out.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.918
Seal the exits.Will do.

38:31.961 --> 38:33.485
He's here
for the time machine.

39:04.429 --> 39:07.301
Break it down.

39:37.026 --> 39:40.726
Griffin. Oh, no.
Griff, honey?

39:40.769 --> 39:42.162
Griffin, sweetheart.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.077
Oh, my God.

40:01.747 --> 40:02.835
Are you okay?

40:02.878 --> 40:04.924
I'm fine.
It's just a scratch.

40:04.967 --> 40:06.186
My doctor is on the way.

40:06.229 --> 40:09.319
What happened?

40:09.363 --> 40:13.062
There was an intruder, and your
brother tried to stop him.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.024
Why don't I take a look
at that?Yeah.

40:18.067 --> 40:20.548
I have to go check in with Doug.
I'll only be a moment.

40:20.592 --> 40:23.116
Okay.Thank you.

40:26.728 --> 40:29.731
So he got away.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.211
And the time machine?

40:31.254 --> 40:34.388
Wells
was able to bring it back.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.781
Remotely?

40:35.824 --> 40:39.045
Yes, he's got it wired up
to computers now.

40:39.088 --> 40:41.656
But it was empty.

40:41.700 --> 40:43.223
John got away.

40:43.266 --> 40:45.051
Where did he go?

40:48.707 --> 40:52.058
March 30, 1918 -- does that date
mean anything to you?

40:52.101 --> 40:54.843
No, what are
the coordinates?

40:54.887 --> 40:57.759
Latitude 48.856 north.

40:57.803 --> 41:01.459
Longitude 2.3522 east.

41:05.158 --> 41:07.073
I don't understand.

41:07.116 --> 41:09.510
Why would John go there?
