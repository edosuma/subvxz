00:10.308 --> 00:11.442
You were fishing
with your pals

00:11.475 --> 00:12.508
the other day...

00:19.642 --> 00:20.875
‐Wayne.
‐Dary.

00:20.908 --> 00:22.342
You should get yourself
fuckin' Puppers.

00:22.375 --> 00:23.842
I already got
a fuckin' Puppers.

00:23.875 --> 00:24.908
I know you're still spittin'

00:24.942 --> 00:26.375
about the shack
gettin' trashed.

00:26.408 --> 00:27.908
But if you don't
tuck in that lip,

00:27.942 --> 00:29.442
a bird's gonna come over here
and poop right on it.

00:29.475 --> 00:30.742
What do I say about
talkin' too much, Dary?

00:30.775 --> 00:32.242
The less you say now,

00:32.275 --> 00:33.275
the less you have
to apologize for later.

00:33.308 --> 00:34.275
‐Good.
‐All I'm saying is,

00:34.308 --> 00:35.608
if you're gonna be poopy,

00:35.642 --> 00:36.942
maybe go try fishing
with somebody else.

00:36.975 --> 00:38.675
What do I say
about the old boss, Dary?

00:38.708 --> 00:40.342
Old boss is always a dick
till you meet the new one.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.642
‐Good.
‐Plus, I think,

00:41.675 --> 00:42.675
the only other people
out here fishing

00:42.708 --> 00:43.908
are either
Ginger or Boots,

00:43.942 --> 00:45.308
who may not
have fucked an ostrich

00:45.342 --> 00:46.675

thinks they did.

00:46.708 --> 00:47.775
Point and fuckin' proof.

00:47.808 --> 00:49.575
You give good advice, Wayne.

00:49.608 --> 00:50.875
Well, what's good for the
goose is good for the gander.

00:50.908 --> 00:52.375
Oh, you're GD right is.

00:52.408 --> 00:53.342
Let's just hope
she doesn't go in one ear

00:53.375 --> 00:54.508

01:09.942 --> 01:11.808
‐That's inappropriate, Dan.
‐Why?

01:11.842 --> 01:13.508
Well, you were just out
in the great wide open

01:13.542 --> 01:14.808
but you wait till
you come back in here

01:14.842 --> 01:16.608
to drop your guts?

01:16.642 --> 01:21.275
Now, just hold your horses,
Wayne, for just one second.

01:21.308 --> 01:22.808
I farted outside, too.

01:22.842 --> 01:25.542
Oh, that is noisy, Dan.

01:25.575 --> 01:26.775
Are you fuckin' serious
with that turtleneck?

01:26.808 --> 01:28.508
‐Figure it out.
‐You figure it out.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.908
Like, that's damn near
doctor‐assisted, Dan.

01:30.942 --> 01:32.642
It's a little bit overripe,

01:32.675 --> 01:34.408
but it's not like I'm falling
aparts on the inside.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.708
Do you wanna know what?

01:35.742 --> 01:37.308
It's time we draw
a line in the sand.

01:37.342 --> 01:38.808
Or the snow,
so to speak.

01:38.842 --> 01:40.542
‐On farts?
‐On farts!

01:40.575 --> 01:41.842
The less you say now,

01:41.875 --> 01:42.808
the less you have
to apologize for later.

01:42.842 --> 01:44.208
Good.
But I've had it.

01:44.242 --> 01:45.708
Let's get real here.

01:45.742 --> 01:47.475
You rip an appropriate fart,
we all have a giggle,

01:47.508 --> 01:48.708
salute and pay tribute.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.608
For a good time,
Tim, Tom and Terrence.

01:50.642 --> 01:52.608
But the inappropriate farts
gotta go.

01:52.642 --> 01:54.275
The inappropriate farts
are turning us into

01:54.308 --> 01:56.275
a bad time
Tony, Todd and Tucker.

01:56.308 --> 01:57.442
Oh, I can'ts wait.

01:57.475 --> 01:58.708
And I mean this...

01:58.742 --> 02:02.242
I can't wait to find out

02:02.275 --> 02:05.942
what could possibly be deemed
an inappropriates fart.

02:05.975 --> 02:07.475
‐Farting in here.
‐In here?

02:07.508 --> 02:08.742
With the door closed, yeah.
Tight quarters.

02:08.775 --> 02:10.542
No airflow. Poor form.

02:10.575 --> 02:13.208
But I'm with friends.
That's who farts are for.

02:13.242 --> 02:14.808
‐Around food, too.
‐Around food?

02:14.842 --> 02:16.608
Especially around
people eating food.

02:16.642 --> 02:17.675
That's fuckin' ignorant.

02:17.708 --> 02:18.875
But I'm eatings, too.

02:18.908 --> 02:20.608
That's when
I'm rife with farts.

02:20.642 --> 02:23.642
Okay, Dan. Dan, okay.
Okay, Dan. Dan, okay.

02:23.675 --> 02:24.942
Let's do an exercise here.

02:24.975 --> 02:26.875
You're in a car,
when's it okay to fart?

02:28.375 --> 02:29.408
When you're alone.

02:29.442 --> 02:30.708
One point for Dary.

02:30.742 --> 02:32.408
It's always okay to fart
when you're alone,

02:32.442 --> 02:33.775
but 'cept when
you're in elevators.

02:33.808 --> 02:35.275
That's uncouth.

02:35.308 --> 02:37.308
You're trying to rob me
of my lifebloods here.

02:37.342 --> 02:38.375
Or you can
roll down the window.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.542
Another point for Dary.

02:39.575 --> 02:40.775
But the car
must be traveling

02:40.808 --> 02:42.542
a minimum of
60 kilometers an hour,

02:42.575 --> 02:44.608
so that the fart may be
aggressively vacuumed out

02:44.642 --> 02:46.308
before penetrating nostrils.

02:46.342 --> 02:48.475
This is literally
all I have going for me.

02:48.508 --> 02:49.542
If you ask permission?

02:49.575 --> 02:52.608
Hmm...

02:52.642 --> 02:53.808
Well, safe to say,

02:53.842 --> 02:55.275
if you have to ask
for permission

02:55.308 --> 02:56.475
it's an inappropriate fart,

02:56.508 --> 02:58.208
but I'll still give you
a half a point.

02:58.242 --> 03:00.942

The cheekiness.

03:00.975 --> 03:02.942

is what it is!

to talk to a guy

03:07.875 --> 03:09.208

Pantene pros in the league,

04:08.842 --> 04:10.308
but we want some wins.

04:10.342 --> 04:12.375
We love being
the silkiest studs,

but no W's is embarrassing.

a knee‐down half‐clapper

04:20.908 --> 04:21.942

No W.

04:24.775 --> 04:27.808
And if we want
some wins in this room,

04:27.842 --> 04:30.375
we gotta get
the puck bunny out of it.

you little bitch?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.875
You don't know
what a puck bunny is?

04:36.908 --> 04:38.875
Not sure I'm familiar
with the term either, Barts.

04:39.642 --> 04:40.875
Okay.

04:40.908 --> 04:43.908
Whereas musicians
have groupies,

04:43.942 --> 04:46.808
hockey players
have puck bunnies.

04:46.842 --> 04:48.342
‐Hmm.
‐Right?

04:48.375 --> 04:49.575
‐Yeah.
‐Right? Get it?

04:49.608 --> 04:50.908
I think I understand.

04:50.942 --> 04:52.475
A puck bunny is someone
who seeks a relationship

04:52.508 --> 04:54.408
with hockey players,
specifically.

04:54.442 --> 04:56.208
Seeks to fuck them.
Yes.

‐I have no problem with that.
‐Right.

is getting in the way of wins.

she liked my team jacket.

is hide in degen blinds,

to deer blinds.

is to discuss a stronger lure

15:08.861 --> 15:09.994
to get them out here.

15:10.028 --> 15:11.761

pissin' outside, nothing.

15:17.261 --> 15:19.194
that if you were to watch

15:19.228 --> 15:20.494
you would stop

15:20.528 --> 15:23.294
"What a fuckin' degenerate

15:23.328 --> 15:25.828
I would say at the top of
the list would probably be...

15:27.161 --> 15:28.494

15:28.528 --> 15:30.861

15:34.528 --> 15:37.228
Now, hear me out,
just hear me out.

15:37.261 --> 15:40.228
What we could do
is we advertise a party

15:40.261 --> 15:42.828
for ethnicities
out here at the shack.

15:42.861 --> 15:44.494
And we could use
the ethnicities to lure out

15:44.528 --> 15:46.828
the degens that we wants
to beat the shits out of.

15:49.994 --> 15:51.494

15:51.528 --> 15:53.361
Well, you didn't let me
finish, Boss Hogg.

15:53.394 --> 15:54.928
So, what we could do, okay,

15:54.961 --> 15:57.528
is once we bring
the ethnicities out here,

15:57.561 --> 15:59.961
we could beat up
the degens

15:59.994 --> 16:03.261
before they could try
to beat up the ethnicities.

16:03.294 --> 16:05.994
You're still walkin' a super
fine line there, big chief.

16:06.028 --> 16:07.161
You didn't let me finish.

16:07.194 --> 16:08.828
See, what we can do now,

16:08.861 --> 16:13.461
is have the ethnicities
help us beat up the degens

16:13.494 --> 16:16.428

is homophobics.

Who is?

16:49.261 --> 16:50.528
The less you say now,

16:50.561 --> 16:51.461
the less you have
to apologize for later.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.261
Good.

16:53.294 --> 16:55.028
You see, Professor Tricia
from my women's studies class

16:55.061 --> 16:56.528
teaches us that homophobia

16:56.561 --> 16:59.761
is not just condemning
homosexualitys,

16:59.794 --> 17:00.994
but it's also not using

17:01.028 --> 17:02.494
the appropriate
and preferred terms

17:02.528 --> 17:04.461
what homosexuals
likes to be called by.

17:04.494 --> 17:06.928
Yeah, but they call themselves
twinks sometimes.

17:06.961 --> 17:09.961
Like, I'd be offended by that.

17:09.994 --> 17:11.861
I might be offended
by that, too.

17:11.894 --> 17:13.428
You see,
where I'm from,

17:13.461 --> 17:15.061
sometimes when people think
things are dumb or stupid,

17:15.094 --> 17:16.528
they just say that it's gay.

17:16.561 --> 17:18.528
Yeah, but you're not exposed
to say that anymore.

17:18.561 --> 17:20.028
Are you a homophobes?

17:20.061 --> 17:21.794
No.

17:21.828 --> 17:23.861
Well, 'cause what you said
was definitely homophobics.

17:23.894 --> 17:25.461
Fucks this is a lot of work.

17:25.494 --> 17:27.394
Hmm. It's like pickin' stones
and doin' hay all at once.

17:27.428 --> 17:29.061
Fuckin' degens.

17:29.094 --> 17:31.294
I'm pretty sure
you're a homophobist.

17:31.328 --> 17:34.261
I beat the shit out of you
one time for beating up a gay.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.328
Yeah, I didn't know
he was gay.

17:36.361 --> 17:38.228
He called me a fag.

17:38.261 --> 17:40.228
Well, this certainly
has come full circle.

17:40.261 --> 17:41.861
Yeah, see,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.494
but youse being offendeds
at being calleds a fag,

17:43.528 --> 17:46.161
is also technically
homophobics.

17:46.194 --> 17:47.928
I'm gonna take
a fuckin' migraine here.

17:47.961 --> 17:49.294
Well, see,
where I'm from...

17:49.328 --> 17:50.994
We all knows where youse
comes from, McMurray,

17:51.028 --> 17:52.394
but times
they are a changin'.

17:52.428 --> 17:54.228
TYSON:
I think we can all agree here

17:54.261 --> 17:57.928
that homophobists
are degenerates.

17:57.961 --> 17:59.394
You call the rest
a misunderstanding.

17:59.428 --> 18:01.094
Call it a fuckin' day here.

18:01.128 --> 18:02.428
Ah, you had good intentions.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.894
Well, wait,
just so I understand here,

18:04.928 --> 18:07.894
using gays
to lure degens out here

18:07.928 --> 18:10.294
is just as bad,
if not worse,

18:10.328 --> 18:13.361
than using ethnicities
to lure degens out here

18:13.394 --> 18:14.761
that we wants
to beats the shit out of?

18:14.794 --> 18:16.461
Christ sake.

18:16.494 --> 18:18.128
And Tyson didn't even say

18:18.161 --> 18:19.994
that the gays would help us
beat up the degens,

18:20.028 --> 18:21.528
where the ethnicities would.

18:21.561 --> 18:23.261
So, I think
it's obvious here, boys,

18:23.294 --> 18:25.961
my idea has a clear edge.

18:25.994 --> 18:27.294
Mmm,
I think it's quite obvious

18:27.328 --> 18:29.494
that using human lures
is pretty extreme.

18:29.528 --> 18:31.828
I'd really likes for you
to meet Professor Tricia.

18:31.861 --> 18:34.961
Okay, so using gays
is homophobic.

18:34.994 --> 18:36.961
Tip of the iceberg, bud.

18:36.994 --> 18:39.728
What about, fake gays?

18:40.828 --> 18:42.361
Well, what's a fake gays?

18:42.394 --> 18:45.094
Well, someone
who may appear to be gay,

18:45.128 --> 18:47.294
but is not actually gay.

18:47.328 --> 18:49.794
And therefore,
it would not be gay‐bashing.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.394
Well, yes, you'd wanna avoid
a hate crime if you could.

18:52.428 --> 18:55.928
So, you wants to use fake gays
to lures the degens?

18:58.261 --> 18:59.461
Perhaps.

18:59.494 --> 19:01.061
DAN: Okay, listen.

19:01.094 --> 19:02.761
Just so long as everyone's
heard my messages

19:02.794 --> 19:03.994
loud and clears...

19:05.128 --> 19:06.461
I thinks
I can lives with that.

19:06.494 --> 19:09.061
Okay. This has been very
diplomatic and rational.

19:09.094 --> 19:10.961
I think the next step
in the order of business here,

19:10.994 --> 19:12.994
would be to go and find
some fake gays

19:13.028 --> 19:14.794
for these degenerates
to beat up.

19:14.828 --> 19:15.861
I know where to look.

19:17.394 --> 19:18.861
Put a fuckin' shirt on.

19:34.913 --> 19:37.513
Barts. Yorkie.
Schultzy. Fisky...

19:38.780 --> 19:39.946
‐Katy?
‐Hey, bud.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.713
Hey, bud.

19:42.746 --> 19:45.013
The boys are supposed
to have just dusted praccy.

19:45.046 --> 19:47.613
Aw, two‐a‐days.
They're on dry land now.

19:47.646 --> 19:49.513
‐Unreal.
‐Hundy P.

19:52.046 --> 19:53.413
Been wheelin'?

19:54.646 --> 19:56.480
Been turnin' on
the jets, yeah.

19:56.513 --> 19:57.880
Some notches on the bed post?

19:57.913 --> 20:00.446
‐I've been notching.
‐Hashtag notch or die.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.346
‐Eat. Sleep. Notch.
‐Who?

20:02.380 --> 20:03.846
Been making my way
up the roster.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.080
‐A full roster?
‐No call‐ups, obviously.

20:06.113 --> 20:08.046
Yeah, of course.
They're not even schmelts yet.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.513
And not Reilly and Jonesy.

20:09.546 --> 20:10.713
I'd never touch them.

20:10.746 --> 20:12.980
I'd never want
to piss you off.

20:13.013 --> 20:14.380
(SCOFFS)

20:15.580 --> 20:16.713
About that.

20:17.846 --> 20:18.846
Yeah?

20:20.913 --> 20:24.313
Do you remember when
you cheated on my brother?

20:26.413 --> 20:29.480
‐Yeah.
‐And I went around town

20:29.513 --> 20:31.713
telling everyone
that I was going to get you?

20:32.813 --> 20:34.680
Yeah.

20:34.713 --> 20:37.846
But then you left town,
so I couldn't.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.580
Couldn't what?

20:41.046 --> 20:42.446
Get you.

20:43.813 --> 20:44.846
Yeah.

20:45.846 --> 20:48.513
I guess, I could still...

20:52.580 --> 20:53.913
Get you.

20:53.946 --> 20:55.946
Yeah.

20:55.980 --> 20:57.880
Stay away from
this dressing room.

20:59.113 --> 21:01.646
‐Yeah.
‐And all the players in it.

21:02.980 --> 21:04.080
Yeah.

21:04.113 --> 21:07.580
Especially Reilly and Jonesy.

21:08.113 --> 21:09.380
Yeah.

21:10.913 --> 21:12.046
And one more thing.

21:12.980 --> 21:13.980
Yeah?

21:16.480 --> 21:17.746
Open your eyes.

21:18.646 --> 21:19.946
(EXCLAIMS)

21:19.980 --> 21:22.413
‐(EXCLAIMS)
‐Fuckin' get after it then.

21:27.046 --> 21:28.046
(EXHALES)

21:30.580 --> 21:31.846
Hey, big brother.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.446
Good and you?

21:33.480 --> 21:35.646
Don't say I never done
nothin' for ya.

21:41.046 --> 21:43.280
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

21:57.046 --> 21:58.046
Konnichiwa.

22:00.746 --> 22:03.380
You are an embarrassment,
Devon.

22:03.413 --> 22:04.646
For shame, Devon!

22:07.680 --> 22:11.080
(SQUEALS) A girl!

22:11.113 --> 22:12.880
(SCREAMING)

22:15.813 --> 22:17.613
You know,
not to bitch and complain...

22:17.646 --> 22:19.313
Not to piss and moan...

22:19.346 --> 22:21.413
It's a lot of work,
these fuckin' degens, I know.

22:21.446 --> 22:22.913
Figures you have to look
at the checklist.

22:24.380 --> 22:25.780
Advertised for a gay party?

22:25.813 --> 22:27.480
We really need some
sort of bar in this town.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.480
Or homosexual.
Or queers.

22:29.513 --> 22:31.646
You know, however
they choose to be identified.

22:31.680 --> 22:33.480
Check.
Recruited fake gays.

22:33.513 --> 22:35.646
‐God, those guys are pansies.
‐Check.

22:35.680 --> 22:37.646
Tidied up the area
in and around the shack

22:37.680 --> 22:39.413
to make it look presentable
for a fake gay party.

22:39.446 --> 22:41.313
‐Took all goddamn day, but...
‐Check.

22:41.346 --> 22:42.646
Constructed degen blinds,

22:42.680 --> 22:45.013
so that we may hide out
and wait for the degens

22:45.046 --> 22:46.880
to try and ambush
the fake gay party.

22:46.913 --> 22:48.713
‐Fucks it cold.
‐Check.

22:48.746 --> 22:50.380
Paid Tyson and McMurray
their wages,

22:50.413 --> 22:52.380
so as to help us beat the shit
out of the degens.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.546
Fuckin' degens.

22:53.580 --> 22:54.980
BOTH: Check.

22:55.013 --> 22:56.580
You should really try EI.

22:56.613 --> 22:57.946
Right, then we're ready
to get this rig rollin'.

22:57.980 --> 23:01.013
Not a moment too soon.
Here they come.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.380
Okay, everybody
into their degen blind.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.480
When the motion sensor
light bulb comes on,

23:05.513 --> 23:08.080
time to jump out and beat
the shit out of the degens.

23:08.113 --> 23:09.480
Thank Christ.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.946
'Cause if there was even
one more chore,

23:10.980 --> 23:12.946
I mean, even one
more chore involved

23:12.980 --> 23:15.446
in beating the shit out
of degens from up country,

23:15.480 --> 23:16.846
I'd be pulling the chute.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.646
‐(PHONE VIBRATES)
‐(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

23:19.680 --> 23:21.613
Okay, gonna need
to replace the light bulb

23:21.646 --> 23:22.746
on the motion sensor light.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.613
ALL: No!

23:24.646 --> 23:26.780
Oh, hot Jimmy...

23:26.813 --> 23:28.980
My farmhand just texted me
and said he's got the scoots,

23:29.013 --> 23:30.080
he's gotta go home.

23:30.113 --> 23:31.713
Means I gotta go chorin' boys.

23:31.746 --> 23:33.546
McMurray, tell him
to drop trou' in the gutter

23:33.580 --> 23:34.613
like a real man.

23:34.646 --> 23:36.380
Be the boss, McMurray.

23:36.413 --> 23:38.713
Oh, I don't wanna be a dick.
What if he shits himself?

23:38.746 --> 23:40.480
Old boss is always a dick
till you meet the new one.

23:40.513 --> 23:41.946
‐Good.
‐Shit!

23:41.980 --> 23:44.080
Boss needs me to come in.
It's an emergency.

23:44.113 --> 23:46.013
Yeah, the wheels are falling
off here, good buddy.

23:46.046 --> 23:47.613
Well, we needs
Tyson and McMurray,

23:47.646 --> 23:49.013
there's gonna be
a baker's dozen sleds

23:49.046 --> 23:50.413
coming around the corner,

23:50.446 --> 23:52.480
and we are way the fucks
outnumbered.

23:52.513 --> 23:54.080
Wanna know what?

23:54.113 --> 23:56.513
All this work involved in
luring these degens out here,

23:56.546 --> 23:57.880
all these fuckin' chores...

23:57.913 --> 23:59.380
Fuckin' cold.

23:59.413 --> 24:00.846
We bring these shirtless
nut sacs out here

24:00.880 --> 24:02.380
to be fake gay dudes...

24:02.413 --> 24:03.746
I'm still not sure
how I feel about that.

24:03.780 --> 24:05.313
Yeah, there's something wrong.

24:05.346 --> 24:06.580
I don't know what it is,
or why, but there is.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.746
It's not quite sexist,

24:07.780 --> 24:09.446
but it's not
quite homophobist.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.546
It's something though.
I know it is.

24:11.580 --> 24:13.546
It's not PCs,
that's for damn sures.

24:13.580 --> 24:17.346
I'm just thinking,
all this work luring them out,

24:17.380 --> 24:20.013
wouldn't the more efficient
thing be to repel them?

24:20.046 --> 24:21.880
That's a Texas‐sized 10‐4!

24:21.913 --> 24:23.480
I'm farting!

24:23.513 --> 24:24.613
Appropriate!

24:24.646 --> 24:25.813
Well, I could always stay

24:25.846 --> 24:26.780
to just kick
the shit out of them

24:26.813 --> 24:28.313
just 'cause they're here.

24:28.346 --> 24:29.080
And then I have to leave
right away, right after,

24:29.113 --> 24:30.480
to get back to chorin'.

24:30.513 --> 24:31.646
Fuck! Same.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.380
‐EI, boys.
‐WAYNE: Well, yeah.

24:33.413 --> 24:34.846
Like, we're already out here.
We're already set up.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.713
We'll beat the shit
out of them before chorin'.

24:36.746 --> 24:39.346
Well, maybe next time
we'll just try to repels them.

24:39.380 --> 24:40.746
Well, that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.480
Well, what could
we put out here

24:42.513 --> 24:45.013
that would make sure that
nobody ever came out here

24:45.046 --> 24:46.846
for anything ever?

24:49.046 --> 24:50.613
I know where to look!
