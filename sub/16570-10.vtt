00:07.590 --> 00:10.650
I guarantee you
this would be on the detectives exam.

00:10.827 --> 00:12.158
"Transferred intent."

00:12.328 --> 00:15.126
Yeah, well, believe me. That one, I know.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.558
<i>Tum, pa-ra, rum-pum</i>

00:22.405 --> 00:24.032
Delivery for Major Crimes.

00:24.207 --> 00:27.574
One, two, three, four, five boxes.

00:27.744 --> 00:28.870
Buzz!

00:33.583 --> 00:34.675
This one's not mine.

00:34.851 --> 00:37.046
It says "Major Crimes, L.A.P.D."

00:37.220 --> 00:40.781
- But I didn't order this.
- You're Major Crimes. And it's COD.

00:56.039 --> 00:59.372
I don't know.
Duct tape's never a good thing.

01:00.210 --> 01:02.041
Did you say duct tape?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.723
You're good to go.

01:19.062 --> 01:22.054
Hey, not by my desk, Julio.
Now, I mean it.

01:23.299 --> 01:25.062
Where should we take it?

01:39.749 --> 01:43.185
<i>- We should call the chief.
- There's no need to alarm her.</i>

01:47.190 --> 01:49.283
Okay. Here goes nothing.

01:53.630 --> 01:57.157
All right, out. All right? Everybody out.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.903
Now we alarm the chief.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.705
Oh, for heaven sakes,
her feet were so small.

02:09.312 --> 02:12.406
"Grauman's Chinese Theater
was built in 1927.

02:12.582 --> 02:16.746
There are nearly 200 Hollywood celebrity
handprints, footprints...

02:16.920 --> 02:20.822
...and autographs in the concrete
of the theater's forecourt."

02:20.990 --> 02:23.754
Uh-huh. Are these people
who used to be famous?

02:23.927 --> 02:24.951
That's right.

02:27.197 --> 02:28.824
This is not working.

02:28.998 --> 02:30.693
- What? Charlie's having a great time.
- Gah.

02:30.867 --> 02:34.064
She's not having a great time.
Stop with the tourist attractions.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.637
Take your niece to The Grove
or to have lunch.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.175
Go ahead, anything to end this.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.206
She's having a great time.

02:45.381 --> 02:46.609
- Hello?
- Chief.

02:46.783 --> 02:50.685
Um, yeah, I know you said not to call
unless it was important...

02:50.854 --> 02:53.652
...but we, uh...

02:53.823 --> 02:56.656
<i>Well, we ended up with a crime scene.</i>

02:56.826 --> 02:57.850
Where is it?

03:10.073 --> 03:14.669
Chief, we're calling him Jack,
like in jack-in-the-box. You get it?

03:14.844 --> 03:16.334
Yes, lieutenant, I get it.

03:16.512 --> 03:20.380
What I don't get is
how Mr. Box ended up in my office.

03:23.052 --> 03:26.544
- Well, I may have suggested...
- Oh, lieutenant.

03:26.723 --> 03:29.055
I won't be able
to breathe in here for weeks.

03:32.095 --> 03:34.427
Okay. Oh...

03:37.100 --> 03:38.499
Do we know where he came from?

03:38.668 --> 03:42.365
The return address says, "Greg Lewis,
Stow 'Nuff Self Storage in Reseda."

03:42.538 --> 03:46.065
- He's on his way in. I'll get him in a room.
- Thank you.

03:47.277 --> 03:49.302
- Oh, hi, chief.
- Ugh. What is that?

03:49.479 --> 03:52.414
Scented candles.
It'll help with the smell.

03:52.582 --> 03:54.345
- Chief Johnson.
- Ugh.

03:54.517 --> 03:57.145
- Yuck.
- Sorry, Dr. Morales.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.185
- Oh, I assume that's the body.
- Yeah.

03:59.355 --> 04:02.085
- We're calling him Jack, as in...
- Jack-in-the-box.

04:02.258 --> 04:04.283
I get it. Yes, very amusing.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.257
Well, smells like murder to me.

04:08.631 --> 04:09.928
Oh, hello, Terrence.

04:10.099 --> 04:12.431
It's Dr. Terrence now.
I finished med school.

04:12.602 --> 04:15.002
Now I'm doing my residency
down in the decomp room.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.435
You should stop by.
We get great muffins down there.

04:18.608 --> 04:20.269
- Paging Dr. Terrence.
- Oh, sorry.

04:21.244 --> 04:23.974
The good news is the body
has been kept virtually intact...

04:24.147 --> 04:26.138
...because of the plastic
and the duct tape.

04:26.316 --> 04:29.342
So Dr. Terrence hopefully
will find a cause of death.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.716
- Quickly.
- Thank you, Dr. Morales.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.160
- Oh.
- Buzz, would you please close the door?

04:38.328 --> 04:40.296
Thank you.

04:44.567 --> 04:46.626
I'm so sorry, y'all.

04:46.803 --> 04:49.704
- There was a dead person in that box?
- Yes.

04:50.807 --> 04:52.240
What are we gonna do about?

04:53.209 --> 04:57.043
Uh, I could be fine at the house
watching TV.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.113
Or maybe I could make you guys dinner.

04:59.282 --> 05:01.978
Mom and Dad work,
so I end up doing a lot of that at home.

05:03.920 --> 05:04.944
Dinner sounds great.

05:06.122 --> 05:08.386
Okay, well, I'll, um, see y'all later.

05:09.459 --> 05:11.791
- Bye.
- Shall we?

05:15.665 --> 05:18.429
<i>Just button it up
till the boss gets here, okay?</i>

05:18.601 --> 05:21.900
Deputy Chief Johnson,
uh, meet Greg Lewis.

05:22.071 --> 05:24.335
He is the owner of Stow 'Nuff Storage.

05:24.507 --> 05:26.634
- Thank you for coming in today.
- Uh-huh.

05:26.809 --> 05:30.301
- I'm guessing you got my package.
- Yes, sir, we did.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.278
I've been trying to get the police
to look for a month.

05:33.883 --> 05:36.750
- Excuse me?
- I reported it to the L.A.P.D. four times...

05:36.919 --> 05:37.943
...and no one came.

05:38.121 --> 05:43.184
Finally, I talked to some old cranky guy,
no offense, an Officer Katzman.

05:43.359 --> 05:46.590
I said, "I have this box,
and I think it could be something major."

05:46.763 --> 05:50.164
So he told me to mail it
to Major Crimes.

05:53.236 --> 05:55.966
- So, what's in it?
- You don't know?

05:56.139 --> 05:58.835
Uh-uh, look like trouble.
No way I was opening it.

05:59.008 --> 06:02.876
Well, sir, as it turns out,
you sent us a dead body.

06:05.848 --> 06:09.750
I knew it. The duct tape,
it scared the crap out of me.

06:09.919 --> 06:13.013
- So whose body is it?
- We were hoping you could tell us.

06:14.490 --> 06:17.926
You think that I killed someone...

06:18.094 --> 06:20.460
...and then I mailed the body to you?

06:22.732 --> 06:24.495
How stupid would that be?

06:24.667 --> 06:29.661
- Well, where did you find the cooler, sir?
- Unit 943 in my storage facility.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.534
- Courtney defaulted on...
- Courtney?

06:31.707 --> 06:34.699
Doug Courtney,
the guy that's renting 943. Ai!

06:35.711 --> 06:38.179
He was using
our automatic payment feature...

06:38.347 --> 06:41.248
...but his debit card is expired.

06:41.417 --> 06:44.511
So I tried to get in touch with him
for the standard 60 days...

06:44.687 --> 06:46.416
...but he never got back to me.

06:46.589 --> 06:50.150
Which what allowed us
to auction off his stuff.

06:50.326 --> 06:55.093
But the only thing in 943
was that horrible box.

06:56.532 --> 07:02.493
Sir, can you tell us, ahem, the last time
Mr. Courtney was at your facility?

07:02.672 --> 07:07.939
No idea. I only see people
when they fill out the rental application.

07:09.145 --> 07:10.908
I could fax that to you.

07:11.214 --> 07:12.272
Hmm?

07:12.448 --> 07:15.178
There's not much here.
Just an address and a phone number.

07:15.351 --> 07:19.583
12 Lane A, Sunny Estates, Los Angeles,
California. It's a mobile home park.

07:19.755 --> 07:23.589
It's Mr. Courtney's parents' address.
His mother and his stepfather.

07:23.759 --> 07:28.458
And Mr. Courtney has a record.
Shoplifting, two counts of assault.

07:28.631 --> 07:32.761
Wait. Just because Courtney has a record
doesn't mean he killed Mr. Box.

07:32.935 --> 07:35.733
Uh, and we can't say for sure
that Mr. Box was actually murdered.

07:35.905 --> 07:38.806
Well, we know that he was broken in half
and folded into an ice cooler.

07:40.176 --> 07:42.076
Which is suspicious to me.

07:42.245 --> 07:43.337
Detective Sanchez?

07:43.513 --> 07:47.950
Well, according to the DMV, Mr. Courtney
has a 1997 red Chevy Camaro.

07:48.117 --> 07:52.281
Registration lapsed in 2006,
no outstanding citations, no flags...

07:52.455 --> 07:54.116
...doesn't seem to be stolen, chief.

07:54.290 --> 07:58.124
And his only financial activity
in the past three years...

07:58.294 --> 08:00.660
...are two deposits
from an offshore bank account.

08:00.830 --> 08:04.357
And this is the same account to which
Mr. Courtney's debit card was attached?

08:04.534 --> 08:06.468
It is,
and it has plenty of money in it.

08:06.636 --> 08:10.003
If the card hadn't expired,
the victim would probably be in storage.

08:10.173 --> 08:12.107
So where did Mr. Courtney go?

08:12.275 --> 08:16.507
Maybe he killed Jack Box
and then skipped the country, chief.

08:16.679 --> 08:19.876
- Twenty dollars says he went to Mexico!
- Twenty dollars, Thailand.

08:20.049 --> 08:23.917
- I mean, they go to Thailand a lot lately.
- I'll put 20 on Kuala Lumpur.

08:24.086 --> 08:28.352
Not only is it fun to say, but they have the
largest department store in Malaysia.

08:28.524 --> 08:31.550
Useful information, lieutenant.
Useful, please.

08:31.727 --> 08:34.423
I'll call our customs liaison
and do a passport check.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.589
- Thank you.
- Chief, it is Dr. Terrence.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.597
Oh.

08:41.304 --> 08:42.328
Yes, Terrence?

08:42.505 --> 08:43.836
Sorry, it's taking so long.

08:44.006 --> 08:46.702
I'm having a hard time
getting this guy out of your box.

08:48.477 --> 08:49.501
Didn't sound right.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.505
Do you have a cause of death yet?

08:52.682 --> 08:55.674
Uh, not yet, but there was a wallet
in the, uh, body's pants pocket.

08:55.851 --> 08:59.309
And I, uh, took the liberty of matching
your victim's thumbprint to his license.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.386
So who is he?

09:02.558 --> 09:04.958
His real name is Doug Courtney.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.958
Oh, for heaven sakes. Thank you.

09:07.129 --> 09:08.596
All bets are off, gentlemen.

09:08.764 --> 09:12.165
- Why?
- It turns out our killer is our victim.

09:18.507 --> 09:21.476
I don't think there's gonna be any traffic,
but I will, um... Oh.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.204
Can you hold on one second?

09:24.947 --> 09:28.713
Um... Sorry, I'm just signing
for something here. Thank you.

09:28.884 --> 09:31.978
I can take care of all that today.
All right, I'll see you soon.

09:32.154 --> 09:36.318
Hey, Charlie, you've got some ma...
Some mail.

09:37.727 --> 09:39.957
You got a care package, huh?
From home?

09:40.496 --> 09:44.125
Yeah, from my friend Amy.
I'm thanking her now.

09:46.302 --> 09:48.270
- You gonna open it?
- No.

09:48.437 --> 09:51.497
I didn't realize I was gonna be here
for this long...

09:51.674 --> 09:53.835
...and there's some personal items.

09:54.010 --> 09:58.413
- You wanna see?
- Uh-oh, no. No, that's okay.

10:00.349 --> 10:04.308
- Well, um, I'm going.
- Okay, bye.

10:08.391 --> 10:10.689
- You call me if you need me.
- I will.

10:21.771 --> 10:22.863
And the emblem?

10:23.039 --> 10:27.203
Uh, the California grizzly bear.
Its name is Monarch.

10:27.376 --> 10:31.574
And the, uh, flag was officially adopted
as the state flag in 1911.

10:31.747 --> 10:34.409
I have no idea why that would be
on the detectives exam.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.609
You'll be asked everything
from law to policy to history...

10:37.787 --> 10:40.381
...so you have to be prepared. Oh, sorry.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.525
Two things we need to remember
before we speak to the Dobsons.

10:43.693 --> 10:47.629
One, whoever killed Doug Courtney
knew about the storage facility.

10:47.797 --> 10:50.459
And a missing persons report
was never filed.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.568
So we're not just here
to make a notification to the parents...

10:53.736 --> 10:57.399
...but also to what?
- Interview potential suspects.

10:57.573 --> 10:59.700
Exactly. Now, I'll ask a few questions...

10:59.875 --> 11:03.606
...and once you feel like we have enough
information to warrant a notification...

11:03.779 --> 11:05.474
...you step in.

11:05.648 --> 11:10.142
The desire of the slothful shall killeth him,
for his hands refuse to labor.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.686
Proverbs 21:25.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.850
Now, Doug cares only for the things
of this world:

11:18.027 --> 11:21.155
Liquor, gambling, surfing, sex.

11:21.330 --> 11:26.267
- He ignores that which is eternal.
- Horrible how many people do that.

11:26.869 --> 11:31.863
Uh, Mr. Dobson, Mrs. Dobson, when was
the last time you heard from your son?

11:32.041 --> 11:33.599
Doug is only my stepson.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.641
I didn't get him till he was a teenager.

11:35.811 --> 11:38.279
By that time, he was hard to reach.
I tried, though.

11:38.447 --> 11:42.884
I've had success with other people,
like Sara here.

11:43.853 --> 11:46.879
But, uh, as far as the last time
we saw him...

11:47.056 --> 11:49.422
Well, Doug hasn't been here
for over three years.

11:49.592 --> 11:52.220
And you never filed
a missing persons report?

11:52.395 --> 11:53.885
Only came when he needed money.

11:54.063 --> 11:56.122
The last time he was here,
he was different.

11:56.298 --> 12:00.962
He wasn't worried as much
and he said everything was gonna be okay.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.298
And what happened?
He left without a word.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.771
- He hasn't called us from that day.
- He said he was gonna make sure...

12:06.942 --> 12:08.409
Sara!

12:09.145 --> 12:12.603
I have told you a thousand times,
just be grateful that he is gone.

12:12.782 --> 12:14.147
Be thankful.

12:16.051 --> 12:19.316
We are. We're thankful.

12:27.029 --> 12:31.728
When Doug was, uh, here last,
did he leave any of his belongings behind?

12:31.901 --> 12:35.337
- A computer or a journal?
- No, he...

12:35.504 --> 12:37.438
- Oh!
- Sara.

12:37.606 --> 12:39.335
Oh, it's okay. I got it.

12:40.509 --> 12:44.639
No, he put everything he had
in a storage facility.

12:48.584 --> 12:50.518
Why are you really here?

12:50.986 --> 12:54.012
I don't see you driving out here
just to ask a few questions...

12:54.190 --> 12:55.817
...unless something's wrong.

12:57.760 --> 12:58.954
What has Doug gotten into?

13:02.064 --> 13:05.795
Well, Mr. And Mrs. Dobson,
I'm really sorry to have to tell you this...

13:05.968 --> 13:08.459
...but your son...
- We haven't been honest with you.

13:09.939 --> 13:12.100
Mr. Gabriel here isn't from L.A.P.D.

13:12.274 --> 13:15.971
He's a, uh, credit agent
from American Express.

13:16.145 --> 13:20.741
Your son is the victim of identity theft,
which is why we've been looking for him.

13:20.916 --> 13:22.042
Uh...

13:22.218 --> 13:26.052
Mr. Gabriel here knows much more
about the ins and outs of this than I do.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.749
So, uh, while you're explaining everything
to the Dobsons...

13:29.925 --> 13:33.224
...I'm gonna just head out to my car
to look through it real fast.

13:33.395 --> 13:38.458
- I'll be back in a jiffy. One second.
- Ha.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.233
What is she talking about?

13:42.404 --> 13:47.967
Um, well, I'm afraid
that someone in Brazil...

13:48.143 --> 13:53.080
...has charged $20,000
to your son's account with us, so...

14:44.800 --> 14:47.701
So we got two wet suits,
some sandy towels...

14:47.870 --> 14:50.395
...and three kinds of surfboard wax.

14:50.573 --> 14:52.370
So I'm going out on a limb here...

14:52.541 --> 14:56.375
...but I say the contents of this duffel bag
says Mr. Courtney was a surfer.

14:56.545 --> 14:58.308
And an avid lotto player.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.938
There's over 200 lottery tickets here,
all with the same six numbers:

15:02.117 --> 15:07.282
- One, three, 11, 21, 22 and 31.
- There's nothing strange about that.

15:07.456 --> 15:10.823
- I bet the same six numbers all the time.
- And how's that working out?

15:10.993 --> 15:15.953
- The odds of ever hitting a jackpot are...
- Tao, please, let me dream.

15:16.131 --> 15:18.361
The stack of mail we got
from Courtney's PO Box:

15:18.534 --> 15:21.560
Uh, DWP, credit card, cell phone.

15:21.737 --> 15:24.672
By the looks of it,
this guy owed money to everyone.

15:25.174 --> 15:28.666
- Chief Johnson?
- Terrence. Terrence, what a surprise.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.438
- Dr. Terrence.
- Right.

15:31.614 --> 15:35.482
Uh, I have cause of death for Mr. Courtney.
Figured I'd bring the results by in person.

15:35.651 --> 15:37.141
And those results would be?

15:37.319 --> 15:40.755
The victim's body was well-preserved.
Whoever wrapped him did a nice job.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.117
Cause of death.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.353
Murder.

15:45.527 --> 15:49.293
Mr. Courtney had two bullet wounds
right above the lumbar vertebrae.

15:49.465 --> 15:52.730
I'm putting a time of death
at May 21st, 2006...

15:52.901 --> 15:56.234
...sometime after 6:12 p.m.

15:56.405 --> 16:00.068
- That's awfully exact. Are you sure?
- I'm a coroner now, Chief Johnson.

16:00.242 --> 16:01.903
- Of course I'm sure.
- Hmm.

16:02.077 --> 16:06.104
But if you can't put faith in me as a doctor,
put your faith in the newspapers.

16:06.815 --> 16:08.715
Newspapers? What newspapers?

16:08.884 --> 16:13.480
The ones at the bottom of the cooler,
dated May 21st, 2006.

16:13.656 --> 16:14.680
Oh.

16:14.857 --> 16:17.690
Also, there was a receipt
for two hot dogs...

16:17.860 --> 16:23.196
...and a 40 of malt liquor.
Same date, 6:12 p.m.

16:23.799 --> 16:26.233
What is malt liquor?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.233
- Chief.
- Hmm. Yes?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.395
I have Mr. Courtney...

16:30.572 --> 16:33.871
I have Mr. Courtney's girlfriend,
Tara Latimer, set up in Interview 1.

16:34.043 --> 16:36.511
I thought Doug was the one.

16:36.679 --> 16:39.147
He was funny, tan.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.817
- Where did you meet him?
- The casino where I worked.

16:43.986 --> 16:45.146
I was a blackjack dealer.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.721
- Oh, so he worked there too?
- No.

16:48.891 --> 16:51.655
He gambled there a lot.

16:52.194 --> 16:55.254
<i>We'd only been dating a month
when he asked me to move in with him.</i>

16:55.431 --> 16:58.127
And I don't know
how he afforded the place after I left...

16:58.300 --> 17:01.497
...but I can be sure
that the landlord didn't cut him any slack.

17:01.670 --> 17:05.265
- He hated Doug.
- He was the worst tenant I ever had.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.932
Should have evicted his ass
the first sign of trouble.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.939
Two years of his crap was enough.

17:12.114 --> 17:15.675
I got tired of hearing how he lost
all of his rent money gambling at the...

17:15.851 --> 17:19.412
Slot machines. You know,
throwing his money at the lottery.

17:19.588 --> 17:23.957
The same six numbers
his and his parents' birthdays.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.561
Going all in on Texas hold'em
when he had nothing in his hand.

17:27.730 --> 17:31.131
His whole life was a bluff.

17:31.300 --> 17:36.328
- Including his work reference.
- It's from his boss.

17:36.505 --> 17:39.531
What's his name? Jordan Wallace.

17:39.708 --> 17:41.039
Doug never worked for me.

17:41.910 --> 17:44.879
Well, he listed you as his employer
on his rental application.

17:45.047 --> 17:47.811
I was his friend since high school,
he needed a reference.

17:47.983 --> 17:51.817
And when the landlord called,
I said Doug was a good guy.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.820
- What I should have said was...
- He was a pig.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.821
- He was an asshole.
- He was a leech.

17:57.526 --> 18:00.825
I kept loaning him money
until he was into me for 10 grand.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.896
<i>I know it doesn't seem like much now.</i>

18:03.065 --> 18:05.465
But when I was starting
my real-estate business...

18:05.634 --> 18:08.125
...homes all over the world,
that meant everything.

18:09.438 --> 18:13.499
Mr. Wallace, do you remember
the last time you saw Mr. Courtney?

18:13.675 --> 18:16.235
Well, I remember the last time
I didn't see him.

18:16.411 --> 18:20.245
I went over to Court's apartment to help
him move his stuff into a storage unit.

18:21.750 --> 18:22.842
He never showed up.

18:23.685 --> 18:25.516
And I gave up
on his returning the key.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.451
I went over to throw him out personally,
no one was there.

18:28.824 --> 18:31.622
You know I...
I called the girl he used to live with.

18:32.227 --> 18:35.526
She says that he moved everything out
to a storage unit in the valley.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.927
So they all knew about the storage unit.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.692
<i>His crap was still there
in the apartment.</i>

18:39.868 --> 18:42.996
- Screwed me out of all my money.
- Then he screwed my daughter.

18:43.172 --> 18:47.370
Another girl in our bed.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.103
- Nobody cheats on me.
- Not with my daughter.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.270
Everybody wanted to kill him.

18:52.447 --> 18:54.347
So, Sergeant Gabriel...

18:54.516 --> 18:57.212
...if you were taking the lead
on this investigation...

18:57.386 --> 19:00.446
...how would you sum it up so far?

19:00.622 --> 19:06.527
Well, ugh, I'd say Mr. Courtney
took advantage of everyone he knew...

19:06.695 --> 19:09.892
...and his disappearing is the best thing
to happen to these people.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.465
Which makes them all suspects.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.176
Yoo-hoo.

19:21.510 --> 19:23.603
Charlie?

19:24.746 --> 19:28.773
Uh, Aunt Brenda, you're home early.

19:28.951 --> 19:31.647
- Uh, did you find your killer?
- No.

19:31.820 --> 19:36.154
- What's that delicious smell?
- It's supposed to be a surprise.

19:36.325 --> 19:40.125
But I promise
we're gonna have a fun, fun dinner.

19:41.163 --> 19:42.596
Okay.

19:43.966 --> 19:45.866
Hmm.

20:11.994 --> 20:13.461
Oh.

20:14.529 --> 20:17.191
Charlie, how long did you say
till dinner's ready?

20:17.366 --> 20:20.028
Uh, I'll have it on the table
in another hour.

20:20.202 --> 20:23.228
Okay.

20:31.346 --> 20:34.144
Aunt Brenda, dinner's ready.

20:40.822 --> 20:44.087
Charlie, we need to talk.

20:44.593 --> 20:50.156
- Aunt Brenda, you went in my room?
- I stole a brownie. Ahem. Or two.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.032
Or three.

20:53.969 --> 20:56.403
Oh, my God.

20:59.675 --> 21:04.305
These are the very best brownies...

21:04.479 --> 21:07.642
...I have ever had in my entire life.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.146
- Did you make these from scratch?
- Uh-huh.

21:11.320 --> 21:12.947
And you had three?

21:17.159 --> 21:19.787
- Whoo!
- Oh, biscuits.

21:20.662 --> 21:22.152
Oh, potatoes.

21:23.799 --> 21:25.323
Chicken fried steak.

21:27.169 --> 21:28.602
Home fried okra.

21:37.346 --> 21:41.942
Staking out that storage facility
isn't working out like I thought it would.

21:42.117 --> 21:45.348
- I hate working out.
- Me too.

21:46.855 --> 21:48.117
Oh.

21:48.290 --> 21:51.987
Maybe it was the victim's girlfriend...

21:52.894 --> 21:56.022
...because he cheated on her
with the landlord's daughter.

21:56.198 --> 21:58.359
Maybe it was him.

21:58.533 --> 21:59.830
The landlord, I mean.

22:00.936 --> 22:05.964
Maybe it's his friend
that he mooched from...

22:06.141 --> 22:07.165
...Jordan Wallace.

22:07.342 --> 22:11.642
Maybe it's his stepfather.
He's so mean.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.411
Maybe...

22:18.220 --> 22:20.882
<i>Maybe</i>

22:21.056 --> 22:26.688
<i>I love you</i>

22:28.563 --> 22:33.023
<i>Quite as good as I should have</i>

22:33.201 --> 22:37.729
- Hey, sorry I'm so late.
- That's okay, Uncle Fritzy.

22:38.540 --> 22:40.064
Brenda? What's going on?

22:40.242 --> 22:45.305
<i>You're always on my mind</i>

22:45.480 --> 22:47.744
<i>You're always on m...</i>

22:47.916 --> 22:49.440
I'm singing.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.586
You always said I had a great voice.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.145
What's going on here?

22:54.322 --> 22:57.621
We're having second helpings
of the best southern dinner...

22:57.793 --> 22:59.658
...this side of the Mississippi.

22:59.828 --> 23:01.557
Chicken fried steak, fried okra...

23:01.730 --> 23:07.669
...and the very best brownies
made in human history.

23:07.836 --> 23:14.105
- Really? She made brownies?
- No, don't. Wait. Wait until after you eat.

23:16.378 --> 23:19.245
- Sweetheart, sweetheart. Sweetie?
- Hmm.

23:19.414 --> 23:21.006
Why don't you go get in bed?

23:21.183 --> 23:24.084
- And I'll be there in a minute, okay?
- Fritzy...

23:25.454 --> 23:27.012
...we have company.

23:29.124 --> 23:32.855
Okay. Shh. We'll be very, very quiet. Shh.

23:53.615 --> 23:56.277
Who do you think you are
bringing marijuana into my house?

23:57.385 --> 24:00.081
Is this the care package
which I signed for?

24:00.255 --> 24:03.315
- Yeah, lighten up, Uncle Fritz.
- What? Lighten up? Lighten up?

24:06.228 --> 24:08.287
You drugged your aunt
without her permission.

24:08.463 --> 24:11.489
If I had eaten one, you have
any idea what could have happened?

24:11.666 --> 24:13.964
Do you? I am in AA.

24:14.136 --> 24:17.401
- Lighten up? That's your response?
- It's not my fault you're a drunk.

24:21.676 --> 24:22.734
I've had enough of you.

24:26.348 --> 24:30.307
I thought you should stay here
Did you know that? Huh? Did you?

24:30.485 --> 24:32.578
You said you got that package from Amy.

24:32.754 --> 24:35.018
- What are you doing?
- Yeah, here's the text.

24:35.190 --> 24:36.623
- What are you doing?
- Great.

24:36.791 --> 24:39.692
- Please. What are you doing?
- Her mobile phone and her home.

24:39.861 --> 24:41.795
- What are you doing?
- Calling parents.

24:41.963 --> 24:45.592
Listen, get to your room right now!
Right now, and pack your bags!

24:45.767 --> 24:48.634
You are going home
as soon as I can make arrangements.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.364
What's the fuss?
- Charlie's leaving.

24:51.540 --> 24:53.474
- Huh?
- We're sending her back, Brenda.

24:55.210 --> 24:58.304
- Sending her back?
- I'm sorry but that's it.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.441
That is it.

25:00.982 --> 25:03.974
It is it, Fritzy. That's it. Uh...

25:04.152 --> 25:05.619
Hello.

25:05.787 --> 25:07.015
Mrs. Mannon?

25:07.422 --> 25:12.121
This is Agent Fritz Howard of the FBI.
I'm Charlie Johnson's uncle.

25:12.294 --> 25:13.318
We need to talk.

25:15.630 --> 25:18.531
What's all the screaming?

25:18.700 --> 25:20.759
And yelling?

25:20.936 --> 25:23.063
And carrying on?

25:23.572 --> 25:26.598
Oh, what's all the yelling?

25:27.275 --> 25:28.640
Hmm...

25:38.920 --> 25:40.581
Good morning, sergeant. Ugh...

25:40.755 --> 25:43.986
- You all right, chief?
- Oh, last night I...

25:44.659 --> 25:47.253
I had strange dreams.

25:47.429 --> 25:50.091
Sergeant, does this mean anything to you,
"Send back"?

25:50.265 --> 25:52.460
"Send back." No. No, it doesn't.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.262
Chief, look, Mrs. Dobson is here
in your office.

25:55.437 --> 25:59.703
But it still smells like her son's body.
Oh, my...

26:09.818 --> 26:10.842
Hello, Mrs. Dobson.

26:15.190 --> 26:17.556
How can I help you today, ma'am?

26:17.726 --> 26:20.126
You asked if we had any information
about Doug.

26:22.430 --> 26:25.058
I do. I just...

26:27.102 --> 26:29.536
I couldn't give it to you
in front of my husband.

26:29.704 --> 26:31.831
He forbids me to even speak of Doug.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.374
Is that why you didn't report
your son missing?

26:35.543 --> 26:37.170
You're that afraid of your husband?

26:37.345 --> 26:39.643
I'm afraid enough not to tell him...

26:39.814 --> 26:41.941
...that Doug keeps in touch with me.

26:42.117 --> 26:44.051
In touch how?

26:44.886 --> 26:47.286
Doug's been writing me...

26:47.455 --> 26:49.150
...until about five months ago.

26:52.460 --> 26:56.419
I wanted to show these to you,
but I couldn't let my husband see them.

27:02.504 --> 27:05.496
He was in Hawaii for some time,
Doug was.

27:05.674 --> 27:10.111
And, uh, he moved to Australia to surf.

27:11.146 --> 27:14.946
And that's why
I never reported him missing.

27:15.116 --> 27:16.947
I thought that I knew where he was.

27:22.557 --> 27:25.958
I was able to verify the postage
cancellations on Mrs. Dobson's letters.

27:26.127 --> 27:29.585
- They're genuine.
- Oh, thank you.

27:29.764 --> 27:31.789
Last one was sent five months ago...

27:31.966 --> 27:35.026
...by a man who, according to Terrence,
has been dead three years.

27:37.305 --> 27:39.535
- You rang?
- Oh, jeez.

27:39.708 --> 27:44.509
Yes, I did rang. Why?

27:47.582 --> 27:49.777
Oh, I know why.

27:50.785 --> 27:53.583
I have evidence that contradicts
your conclusion...

27:53.755 --> 27:55.586
...based entirely on newspapers...

27:55.757 --> 28:00.353
...that Doug Courtney
died May 21st, 2006.

28:02.731 --> 28:03.755
Oh.

28:03.932 --> 28:05.559
I appreciate your candor, ma'am...

28:05.734 --> 28:07.565
...but let me say that you're wrong.

28:08.603 --> 28:11.800
I've completed the autopsy on Doug
and I'm able to give the results.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.264
Oh.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.137
In his stomach, I found two hot dogs
and malt liquor residue...

28:16.311 --> 28:19.007
...which, if you recall, is exactly
what was on the receipt...

28:19.180 --> 28:23.514
...found in the victim's wallet,
a receipt that was dated May 21st, 2006.

28:23.685 --> 28:26.916
The same date as the newspapers
which constituted his shroud.

28:30.425 --> 28:33.588
So if you wish to find fault
with my professional opinion...

28:33.762 --> 28:36.026
...I'd be more than happy
to send Mr. Box back...

28:36.197 --> 28:38.529
...and you can figure it out...
- Send it back.

28:39.701 --> 28:41.669
That's it.

28:42.871 --> 28:44.338
Send it back. That's it.

28:44.939 --> 28:49.137
Oh, Dr. Terrence, thank you.
Thank you so much.

28:49.310 --> 28:53.747
Thank you. Okay, thanks.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

28:53.915 --> 28:56.509
- Thank you. That's great. Thanks. Thanks.
- Sorry.

28:56.684 --> 28:58.777
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

29:00.455 --> 29:05.415
Detective Sanchez, ahem, I need some
clear plastic sheets and, uh, duct tape.

29:05.593 --> 29:06.890
- On it, chief.
- Thank you.

29:07.061 --> 29:10.724
Uh, Gabriel, I need four coolers like the one
in which we found Mr. Courtney.

29:10.899 --> 29:12.924
- You got it, chief.
- And Lieutenant Tao...

29:13.101 --> 29:16.764
...I would like to speak to you and Buzz
in the electronics room, please.

29:16.938 --> 29:19.532
- What are you thinking?
- I'm thinking that whoever killed Doug...

29:19.707 --> 29:23.438
...is gonna be very surprised
when he pays them a visit.

29:31.319 --> 29:33.480
Unh, oh, God.

29:33.655 --> 29:36.647
Oh, please tell me we haven't been sent
four more dead bodies.

29:36.825 --> 29:40.317
No, sir, this is all part of a plan
to catch Mr. Courtney's killer.

29:40.495 --> 29:43.760
- Testing, testing, one, two, three. Testing.
- That's a good test.

29:44.632 --> 29:48.898
- We're ready, chief.
- Okay, thank you, lieutenant. Gentlemen.

29:49.070 --> 29:50.094
Explain, please?

29:50.271 --> 29:53.263
Each cooler contains a GPS system
and a camera.

29:53.441 --> 29:57.207
We're sending one cooler
to each of our suspects.

29:57.378 --> 30:02.577
Mr. Courtney's parents, his ex-girlfriend,
his ex-landlord, and his former best friend.

30:02.750 --> 30:06.618
- Whoever opens the cooler...
- Which we can monitor from here.

30:06.788 --> 30:07.812
- Is innocent.

30:08.523 --> 30:12.186
Right, because why would you open the box
if you knew it contained a dead body?

30:12.360 --> 30:14.624
So whoever doesn't open it
is probably guilty.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.787
And will probably try to get rid of it.

30:17.398 --> 30:23.030
Which is where our trackers
and our GPS receiver come into play.

30:23.204 --> 30:26.765
- And this is all within budget?
- Yes, it's the last of Buzz's grant money.

30:26.941 --> 30:28.966
Unless I can return this when we're done.

30:30.645 --> 30:33.011
Let's seal it up.

30:45.426 --> 30:48.657
- Anything new?
- No.

30:48.963 --> 30:52.694
And, uh, other than Mr. Gaviota, here,
we're sure that the coolers were delivered?

30:52.867 --> 30:57.236
Positive. We got confirmation
for each one as they were dropped off.

30:57.405 --> 31:01.000
- Is it just me, or is this taking forever? Oh.
- Chief Johnson, we have something.

31:02.143 --> 31:04.509
I knew it.
All right, gentlemen, pay up.

31:04.679 --> 31:08.240
- Is all this betting necessary?
- Uh, no, ma'am.

31:08.416 --> 31:12.853
But it makes staring at blank screens
for three hours a lot more interesting.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.381
We have a runner.

31:15.557 --> 31:17.491
- Who is it, lieutenant?
- Uh, Mr. Wallace.

31:20.228 --> 31:22.492
But the Dobsons haven't
opened their cooler yet...

31:22.664 --> 31:24.689
...so we can't rule them out
as suspects.

31:24.866 --> 31:28.962
Lieutenant Tao, find out what
we don't know about Mr. Wallace, please.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.037
I'm particularly interested in motive.

31:31.205 --> 31:33.867
Buzz, would you continue to watch
for the Dobsons' cooler?

31:34.042 --> 31:36.067
The rest of us, let's, uh, head out.

31:38.079 --> 31:39.910
Oh, um...

31:40.081 --> 31:43.278
I don't want a suspect looking
at a Crown Vic in the rearview mirror.

31:44.218 --> 31:48.518
- Buzz, what kind of a car do you drive?
- A Prius. Why?

31:50.391 --> 31:52.916
- Oh, no. No, no. We...
- We'll take such good care of it.

31:53.094 --> 31:55.995
- It's brand-new and I just washed it.
- I promise. Good care.

31:57.365 --> 31:59.458
- Thank you very much.
- Please, just...

31:59.634 --> 32:02.262
Don't bring it back with any blood in it
or bullet holes.

32:02.704 --> 32:03.966
Hmm.

32:07.075 --> 32:09.305
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

32:12.814 --> 32:15.806
"What are the main reasons for murder?"

32:15.984 --> 32:19.943
Well, the main reasons for murder
are jealousy, revenge and profit.

32:20.121 --> 32:24.285
Or just because.
Oh, looks like he stopped.

32:24.459 --> 32:27.155
Okay, take the next exit, please.

32:27.328 --> 32:30.058
In Mr. Wallace's case,
jealousy seems unlikely.

32:30.231 --> 32:33.132
Well, the one thing we do know
is that it wasn't for profit.

32:33.301 --> 32:36.998
All Courtney had to his name
was that Camaro and what was in it.

32:37.171 --> 32:39.196
Surfing gear, lottery tickets.

32:39.374 --> 32:43.470
Well, and the $6500 transferred
to his account from the offshore bank.

32:53.488 --> 32:56.116
- Hi, Fritzy, it's me.
- Hey, I was just about to call you.

32:56.290 --> 32:58.952
- I wanted to talk to you about the tickets.
- What tickets?

32:59.127 --> 33:00.526
Plane tickets for Charlie.

33:00.695 --> 33:04.290
I just bought them. She's got a 7 p.m.
flight tomorrow out of LAX.

33:04.465 --> 33:07.923
Well, Fritzy, I wanna talk, uh,
about different travel dates.

33:08.102 --> 33:10.161
Do you have a minute?

33:24.519 --> 33:29.218
No, no, no. We'll talk about it
tonight. Okay. Okay, thank you.

33:29.390 --> 33:31.017
Okay, bye.

33:31.192 --> 33:34.127
Mr. Wallace told us
he ran a global real-estate company...

33:34.295 --> 33:37.958
...and I just had Fritz confirm
with customs where he's been traveling.

33:38.132 --> 33:40.930
Hawaii, Peru, Australia, New Zealand.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.696
- All places Mrs. Dobson got letters from.
- Exactly.

33:45.373 --> 33:47.705
Oh. Oh.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.671
Okay.

33:50.178 --> 33:53.636
- Lieutenant Tao?
- Chief, Mr. Dobson opened up his cooler.

33:53.815 --> 33:56.716
<i>- So we're following the right person.
- And I think I know why.</i>

33:56.884 --> 34:01.014
On May 19th, 2006,
Doug Courtney's numbers hit the lottery.

34:01.189 --> 34:05.387
But Jordan Wallace was the one
who cashed in the ticket for $15 million.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.687
Sounds like motive to me.

34:07.862 --> 34:10.194
- All right, thank you, lieutenant.
- You're welcome.

34:10.364 --> 34:11.592
Okay.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.833
Okay.

34:15.002 --> 34:16.469
Looks like he's right up there.

34:20.373 --> 34:23.866
Okay. I think the car
has a battery-power-only mode.

34:24.045 --> 34:28.175
So we can roll up as quiet as possible.

34:48.703 --> 34:52.230
When you're in a hole this big,
Mr. Wallace, my advice is to stop digging.

34:53.373 --> 34:55.739
Put the shovel down on the ground now.

34:58.079 --> 34:59.478
Do it now.

34:59.647 --> 35:01.911
Keep your hands where I can see them
and step out.

35:04.652 --> 35:08.088
- What you got in the cooler, sir?
- I'm guessing if we open it, sergeant...

35:08.256 --> 35:11.953
...we're gonna find someone
we've been looking for. Isn't that right?

35:24.739 --> 35:27.037
It's him. I think we found Mr. Courtney.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.870
You are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

35:30.044 --> 35:32.342
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

35:32.513 --> 35:34.174
You have the right to an attorney.

35:34.348 --> 35:36.873
If you cannot afford an attorney
one will be appointed.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.281
Have you heard and understood
these rights sir?

35:39.453 --> 35:42.616
Normally, Mr. Wallace,
I like murderers to confess...

35:42.790 --> 35:46.783
...but since I found you digging a grave
in the desert in the middle of the night...

35:46.961 --> 35:51.330
...I feel like I already have your number.
All six of them, actually.

35:52.033 --> 35:54.695
- What?
- Lottery numbers.

35:54.869 --> 35:55.995
You do remember them.

35:56.170 --> 35:59.162
The ones that made you a millionaire?
We'd all love to hear them.

36:03.144 --> 36:04.338
Uh...

36:04.512 --> 36:05.604
One...

36:06.781 --> 36:12.378
- One...
- How about one, three, 11...

36:15.122 --> 36:18.990
One, three, 11, 21, 22, 31.

36:19.160 --> 36:23.153
Odd that you can't remember
the six numbers that changed your life.

36:23.331 --> 36:25.492
Computer picked them, okay?
They were random.

36:25.666 --> 36:28.191
- It's not like they had any meaning.
- They did to Doug.

36:28.369 --> 36:32.567
They were his and his parents' birthdays.
He played them twice a week for years.

36:32.740 --> 36:37.473
- And then in May, 2006...
- May 19th, to be exact.

36:37.645 --> 36:42.344
May 19th, those numbers hit,
and Mr. Courtney won $15 million.

36:42.516 --> 36:44.643
When he told you about it,
you killed him...

36:44.819 --> 36:48.016
...and stole the winning ticket
to claim it as your own.

36:48.189 --> 36:50.817
You murdered your own best friend
for money.

36:50.992 --> 36:52.186
- No. That's a mistake.
- Really?

36:52.360 --> 36:54.988
When we examine this duct tape,
whose fingerprints...

36:55.162 --> 36:57.494
...and DNA will we find on it, sir?

36:58.966 --> 36:59.990
Whose...?

37:00.601 --> 37:03.229
Whose foreign bank account
will we find...

37:03.404 --> 37:05.599
...was transferring money
to Doug's account...

37:05.773 --> 37:07.934
...to pay for where you placed his body?

37:08.109 --> 37:12.546
And the letters, of course? You...
The letters. You remember the letters?

37:13.547 --> 37:19.543
The letters to Doug's mother,
letters from Hawaii...

37:19.720 --> 37:24.054
...Australia, Peru, New Zealand,
all places Doug wanted to go.

37:24.225 --> 37:27.217
All places she thought he might be.
The interesting thing is...

37:27.395 --> 37:31.058
...we can match the stamps from these
letters to the stamps in your passport.

37:31.232 --> 37:34.724
And the DNA we get from the saliva
probably won't hurt our case, either.

37:35.169 --> 37:40.402
But what's really contemptible, sir, is
the false hope you gave to Doug's mother.

37:41.142 --> 37:44.908
- How could you be so cruel?
- Cruel?

37:45.913 --> 37:47.471
You thought that was cruel.

37:47.648 --> 37:50.310
I gave Court's mom something
he never did:

37:50.484 --> 37:53.681
A little attention, a second thought.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.618
So before you lecture me on cruelty...

37:56.791 --> 37:59.692
...let me tell you something
about your so-called victim.

37:59.860 --> 38:02.727
He bought his lottery ticket
with money he borrowed from me.

38:03.297 --> 38:05.162
That was my $15 million.

38:05.333 --> 38:08.393
And he was just gonna walk away with it,
to the nearest casino...

38:08.569 --> 38:11.663
...and throw it all away,
just like he did everything else.

38:11.839 --> 38:15.104
Money like that, that was life changing.

38:15.276 --> 38:19.110
- It changed my life.
- It certainly did.

38:19.280 --> 38:20.577
It turned you into a killer.

38:25.987 --> 38:27.614
Detective Sanchez...

38:27.788 --> 38:29.585
Hands behind your back.

38:32.927 --> 38:37.557
Hey, Gabriel. You even had me believing
that there was a body in there. Heh.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.359
Good job.

38:41.969 --> 38:44.369
So, uh, ahem, chief, I, uh...

38:44.538 --> 38:47.735
I just wanna say
thanks for your support with all this.

38:47.908 --> 38:50.342
Thank you, Detective Sergeant.

38:50.511 --> 38:53.309
- I still have to pass the test.
- I think you already did.

38:53.848 --> 38:57.784
Ah! Oh, poor Buzz. Is that a dent?

39:11.866 --> 39:14.892
I'm so sorry for your loss.

39:18.639 --> 39:20.004
Um...

39:20.174 --> 39:24.907
I remember you told me that Doug said
he wanted to pay you back...

39:25.079 --> 39:27.172
...for all the trouble he'd put you through.

39:28.582 --> 39:31.176
Before your son died,
he came into some money.

39:31.352 --> 39:33.650
Fifteen million dollars, to be exact.

39:36.991 --> 39:40.757
- Fifteen million?
- As soon as the court confirms...

39:40.928 --> 39:44.056
...that that money actually belonged to him,
it will go to his next of kin...

39:44.231 --> 39:48.224
...which is you, and only you.

39:48.402 --> 39:50.233
You might...

39:50.404 --> 39:53.373
...want to use this money
to stand up for yourself.

39:55.976 --> 39:57.944
But...

39:59.480 --> 40:04.611
...it won't bring my son back, will it?

40:06.187 --> 40:07.211
God.

40:09.156 --> 40:12.250
I gave up on my own son.

40:12.426 --> 40:14.894
How does a mother do that?

40:15.629 --> 40:17.096
Give up on a child?

40:27.241 --> 40:29.641
Hello, Charlie. Is Fritz here?

40:32.413 --> 40:36.281
- Hey. You coming with us?
- Uh, to the airport? No.

40:36.450 --> 40:39.783
Charlie, uh, take your bags,
get back into your room and unpack.

40:39.954 --> 40:43.754
- You're not going anywhere.
- Uh, yes, she is.

40:43.924 --> 40:45.721
I'm not unpacking. I'm going home.

40:45.893 --> 40:49.659
I said take your bags,
go back into your bedroom and unpack.

40:49.830 --> 40:54.164
Or you and your pot-mailing friend
can have a big time out...

40:54.335 --> 40:57.668
...for the illegal transport
of a controlled substance.

41:00.074 --> 41:02.167
You wanna be arrested? Do you?

41:12.820 --> 41:14.845
And still no apology?

41:17.458 --> 41:18.550
I have had it with her.

41:18.959 --> 41:21.723
- You're the one who said she could stay.
- One week. It's up.

41:21.896 --> 41:27.095
She's inconsiderate. She is difficult.
She's completely self-centered.

41:27.268 --> 41:31.170
- She's disrespectful.
- She's 16. What else would she be?

41:32.339 --> 41:34.671
If you can't handle this...

41:37.144 --> 41:38.406
You're the one who wants kids.

41:41.348 --> 41:44.511
I wanna be ignored and alienated
by my own, not someone else's.

41:44.685 --> 41:46.710
She's going home tonight.

41:49.023 --> 41:51.924
We can't give up on her.

41:52.092 --> 41:54.526
Like her parents have.
Like my parents have.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.492
If she leaves now
and gets in trouble again...

41:59.633 --> 42:02.431
I think we ought to hold on to her
for a little while longer.

42:03.871 --> 42:07.398
Just so she knows
she has someone that she can rely on.

42:11.378 --> 42:13.346
Exactly what a good mother would say.

42:14.381 --> 42:17.509
Oh, I don't know about that.

42:20.888 --> 42:24.324
- Would you really have arrested her?
- No.

42:27.228 --> 42:28.889
I would have let you do it.
