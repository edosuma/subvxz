00:00.011 --> 00:02.202
<i>Caribbean Reggaeton
music playing...</i>

00:13.495 --> 00:16.394
Seriously, Fabi?
This station again?

00:16.478 --> 00:18.863
- What's the problem?
- You used to love Reggaeton.

00:18.947 --> 00:21.117
Used to.
Makes me homesick now.

00:21.201 --> 00:22.586
Maybe we'll go
back there someday.

00:22.670 --> 00:25.261
Where's James, anyway?
He said he'd only be a minute.

00:25.345 --> 00:26.603
<i>Hey! Stop!</i>

00:27.677 --> 00:28.888
Fabi.

00:30.508 --> 00:31.476
What's he doing?

00:31.560 --> 00:32.545
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

00:32.628 --> 00:33.975
Don't do this.

00:34.059 --> 00:36.263
- Oh...
<i>- Hey! Stay right there!</i>

00:37.436 --> 00:38.741
- James.
- What did you do?

00:38.825 --> 00:40.044
Just relax. Relax. Okay.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.124
Hey, guys.

00:50.505 --> 00:51.769
Nice.

00:51.853 --> 00:53.906
Well, you're cutting
it close, Chris.

00:53.990 --> 00:55.354
Squad conditioning's
in two minutes.

00:55.438 --> 00:57.143
Last one to the mat's first up
against me in the ring.

00:57.227 --> 00:58.371
You better get
your hustle on, man.

00:58.455 --> 00:59.652
Deac and Tan
are already changing,

00:59.736 --> 01:02.126
and the boss here is
hitting it hard this morning.

01:06.874 --> 01:08.547
Nice having Hondo
back in charge,

01:08.631 --> 01:10.650
but these added workouts
are killing me.

01:10.734 --> 01:11.774
Team's been through a lot.

01:11.858 --> 01:14.287
He just wants to get our rep
back as the baddest squad in HQ.

01:14.371 --> 01:16.372
Besides, nothing wrong
with a little extra cardio.

01:16.456 --> 01:19.463
Easy for you to say.
You're not about to spar with...

01:20.668 --> 01:22.123
Happy birthday!

01:24.809 --> 01:25.723
Hey.

01:25.807 --> 01:28.214
It wasn't us, Chris.
We swear.

01:34.125 --> 01:35.857
I was hoping
this would be the year

01:35.941 --> 01:37.326
the juvenile pranks would stop.

01:37.410 --> 01:38.495
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:38.579 --> 01:39.599
Why are you shooting
straight for me?

01:39.683 --> 01:41.544
You know the whole team tries
to outdo each other every year

01:41.628 --> 01:43.161
trying to get you
to celebrate your birthday.

01:43.245 --> 01:45.297
My birthday's not till tomorrow.
You cheated.

01:45.381 --> 01:47.333
Well, that's why
I had to get to you early.

01:47.417 --> 01:48.638
Anything else
you would've seen coming.

01:48.722 --> 01:50.326
Happy B-day, Chris.

01:50.410 --> 01:53.363
You guys are the worst.
But thanks.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.568
- Hey, Chris.
- Hmm?

01:54.652 --> 01:56.663
You got a little something
going on back there.

02:01.388 --> 02:03.339
It's gonna be a good day, boss.

02:04.517 --> 02:06.690
What the hell, James?
What were you thinking?

02:06.774 --> 02:08.479
Look, we're always talking
about going somewhere,

02:08.562 --> 02:10.479
and building better lives
for ourselves, right?

02:10.564 --> 02:11.846
What kind of life you
gonna have in prison?

02:11.930 --> 02:13.849
Look, just calm down.

02:13.933 --> 02:15.383
I got this.

02:17.545 --> 02:19.084
Oh, man. What's this?

02:21.576 --> 02:23.295
Where'd you even
get the gun anyway?

02:23.379 --> 02:26.435
This? It ain't even real,
it's a toy.

02:26.627 --> 02:28.666
Geez... Look, I don't
know how much I grabbed.

02:28.750 --> 02:31.573
It must be hundreds.
No, thousands?

02:31.994 --> 02:34.134
Oh, geez, that's...
How much is it?

02:34.989 --> 02:36.508
James, look.

02:36.592 --> 02:38.007
The police.

02:38.178 --> 02:40.035
All right, just...

02:40.779 --> 02:42.551
be cool, okay?

02:42.963 --> 02:44.836
It's okay.
They're moving now.

02:53.374 --> 02:54.495
James!

02:58.833 --> 03:00.005
Get down, get down!

03:00.345 --> 03:02.411
- James!
- Hold on!

03:10.679 --> 03:12.388
Hold on!

03:18.847 --> 03:21.074
You, in the SUV,

03:21.159 --> 03:22.878
show me your hands!

03:30.331 --> 03:32.283
Oh...

03:32.367 --> 03:34.273
Get out! Go, go!

03:39.174 --> 03:40.458
Fabi.

03:40.542 --> 03:41.692
Take the bag.

03:41.776 --> 03:42.860
Screw the bag, we got to go.

03:42.944 --> 03:44.115
Fabi.
I can't.

03:46.848 --> 03:47.999
I'm not gonna leave you here.

03:48.083 --> 03:50.134
Fabi, take the
bag and go.

03:50.218 --> 03:51.068
Go!

03:51.152 --> 03:52.891
Fabi, come on.

04:20.591 --> 04:22.221
Never been happier to see SWAT.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.698
- How many shooters?
- Two.

04:23.782 --> 04:25.424
Whole thing popped off
without warning.

04:25.508 --> 04:27.049
They started firing
on that car there.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.221
Two kids in it bailed,
took off on foot.

04:29.305 --> 04:30.891
Cover, cover!

04:36.889 --> 04:38.482
Patrol says we got two inside.

04:38.566 --> 04:39.877
Let's not draw this out.

04:39.961 --> 04:41.206
- You want to go with pepper?
- I got it.

04:41.290 --> 04:42.760
Chris, with me.

04:42.844 --> 04:44.547
Post up.

04:48.895 --> 04:50.047
Here we go.

04:50.131 --> 04:51.470
Back driver's side.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.197
Movement.
Driver's side, coming out.

05:03.573 --> 05:05.659
Hey, get on the ground!

05:05.743 --> 05:06.895
Down on your knees!

05:06.979 --> 05:08.923
On the ground
all the way!

05:14.380 --> 05:15.568
Drop the weapon!

05:15.652 --> 05:18.128
Get on the ground now!
Drop!

05:18.543 --> 05:20.958
You're not gonna make it.
Do as he says!

05:21.042 --> 05:22.029
Drop the weapon!

05:22.113 --> 05:23.193
Drop it!
Get down.

05:23.277 --> 05:24.052
Get down!

05:24.136 --> 05:25.411
Tan, Luca, Chris, move in.

05:25.495 --> 05:27.021
- Deacon, you're with me.
- All the way down.

05:27.105 --> 05:28.340
<i>Don't move!</i>

05:28.424 --> 05:30.192
<i>Hands behind your back!</i>

05:30.707 --> 05:31.960
Hands behind your back now!

05:32.044 --> 05:33.299
Down!

05:40.370 --> 05:43.061
He's alive,
but he's been gutshot.

05:43.145 --> 05:46.331
30-David, we need an R/A
at our location, immediately.

05:46.415 --> 05:48.329
Male teen, GSW.

05:49.721 --> 05:50.979
Hondo,

05:51.063 --> 05:52.769
that gun's a toy.

05:53.467 --> 05:55.420
Come on, kid.
Help's on the way.

05:55.504 --> 05:57.423
Hold on for me.
Hold on.

06:08.199 --> 06:09.704
You okay?

06:12.470 --> 06:14.459
That kid...

06:14.606 --> 06:16.258
he's younger than Darryl.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.528
Hey, we got any idea what
the hell went on down here?

06:18.612 --> 06:19.589
Nah, the two shooters
aren't talking,

06:19.673 --> 06:20.753
but check this out.

06:20.837 --> 06:22.885
It's a Kalashnikov AK-103.

06:22.969 --> 06:25.321
- That's military issue.
- Yeah, and both dudes have ink.

06:25.405 --> 06:27.048
Look like Russian mafia.

06:27.747 --> 06:29.639
Three kids and a toy gun.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.371
What the hell did they do
to buy all this?

06:36.182 --> 06:37.997

07:12.770 --> 07:14.755
Hey, son.
You all right?

07:14.839 --> 07:16.425
Hey, Pop. Yeah, I'm fine.

07:16.509 --> 07:19.658
Just some days are longer
than others is all.

07:19.742 --> 07:21.081
Hello.

07:22.527 --> 07:24.116
Hank St. John.

07:24.209 --> 07:25.492
I go by Saint.

07:25.576 --> 07:28.576
- Daniel Jr. They call me...
- I know who you are, Hondo.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.733
Known you since
before you were born.

07:31.043 --> 07:35.457
Now seems everybody knows you
as the cop who speaks the truth.

07:36.527 --> 07:38.443
Saint and I were
in the Panthers together

07:38.527 --> 07:39.240
back in the day.

07:39.324 --> 07:40.520
Though, as I remember,
some of us

07:40.604 --> 07:42.155
were in the party
longer than others.

07:42.239 --> 07:44.195
Oh, that's funny, see,
'cause I remember that

07:44.279 --> 07:45.999
some of us didn't leave
the party soon enough.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.538
You know,
come to think of it, Pop,

07:47.622 --> 07:49.139
you never told me
why you left the Panthers.

07:49.223 --> 07:51.036
But I did tell you to stay
out of grown folks' business,

07:51.120 --> 07:52.394
now didn't I?

07:52.525 --> 07:54.222
Listen, it don't matter.

07:54.997 --> 07:58.253
Saint didn't come here
to jaw jack about the past.

07:58.348 --> 07:59.312
He wants to talk to you.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.381
Talk to me?
What about?

08:01.465 --> 08:04.538
A kid from my community got
caught up in a shoot-out

08:04.622 --> 08:06.194
today in Boyle Heights,

08:06.278 --> 08:08.053
SWAT was involved.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:08.137 --> 08:09.889
This kid, you know him?

08:09.973 --> 08:13.413
Know of him. Name's James.

08:13.497 --> 08:14.972
He's homeless.

08:15.122 --> 08:17.717
He's from the Caribbean,
not too far from where I grew up,

08:17.801 --> 08:19.779
so if there's
something I can do...

08:19.863 --> 08:21.282
Well, right now,
he's in the hospital

08:21.366 --> 08:22.697
- fighting for his life.
- Oh.

08:22.879 --> 08:23.841
Any information on who

08:23.925 --> 08:26.238
or what he's involved with
would be a help.

08:27.075 --> 08:29.740
I have a friend, her name's Ivy.

08:29.824 --> 08:32.607
She's more intimately involved
in our community.

08:32.692 --> 08:34.601
I'd be happy to introduce you
tomorrow.

08:34.684 --> 08:35.924
Thank you.

08:37.061 --> 08:39.400
Oh, yes.

08:41.412 --> 08:42.438
Checkmate.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.544
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, uh.

08:45.575 --> 08:47.366
I'll be damned.
How did you...

08:47.450 --> 08:48.679
The Ruy Lopez opening.

08:48.763 --> 08:51.161
Had you the moment you took
my bishop.

08:53.250 --> 08:54.507
Tomorrow then, Hondo.

08:54.591 --> 08:55.648
I'll be there.

08:55.732 --> 08:58.515
Ruy Lopez, my ass.

08:58.599 --> 09:00.718
- Come on.
- Let's do it again, DH.

09:00.802 --> 09:02.975
- Set it up.
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.766 --> 09:07.385
I can't believe you
passed on dessert.

09:07.469 --> 09:08.812
The tiramisu
there is amazing.

09:08.896 --> 09:10.722
Well, maybe I've got
something else in mind

09:10.806 --> 09:11.952
for dessert.

09:12.036 --> 09:14.243
Oh, come on.
Just invite me in.

09:14.327 --> 09:15.759
I won't stay long.

09:15.843 --> 09:17.913
Look, I'm trying
to be nice here.

09:17.997 --> 09:20.954
No, if you were being nice,
you'd invite me in.

09:21.038 --> 09:23.419
Sorry to interrupt,
everything okay here?

09:23.812 --> 09:25.864
- Yeah, we're fine, don't worry about it.
- I didn't ask you.

09:25.948 --> 09:27.370
I'm asking her.

09:28.264 --> 09:29.862
Man, what is your problem?

09:30.276 --> 09:32.115
I told you we're fine.

09:33.313 --> 09:34.531
Seriously.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.969
Get lost.

09:37.350 --> 09:40.609
Ow! Okay, okay.

09:40.693 --> 09:43.029
You just assaulted a cop,
dumbass.

09:43.194 --> 09:44.663
I'll give you a choice,
you want to go home

09:44.747 --> 09:46.200
or you want to go to jail?

09:52.214 --> 09:53.375
Sorry, you okay?

09:53.459 --> 09:54.070
Yeah.

09:54.154 --> 09:55.021
Thank you.

09:55.131 --> 09:57.257
My Internet date went full-on...

09:57.412 --> 09:58.833
Internet date.

09:58.919 --> 10:00.004
I'm Joy.

10:00.088 --> 10:01.357
Been meaning to introduce myself

10:01.441 --> 10:03.025
- since I moved in.
- I'm Bonnie.

10:03.109 --> 10:04.710
This is my husband, Victor.

10:04.794 --> 10:07.018
You must be the one
who speaks Cantonese?

10:07.102 --> 10:08.453
I sometimes hear you
through the wall.

10:08.537 --> 10:10.265
Yeah, probably on the phone
with my mom.

10:10.349 --> 10:12.374
Wait, you speak
Cantonese, too?

10:12.458 --> 10:14.831
<i>Speaking Cantonese...</i>

10:17.323 --> 10:19.896
<i>Replying in Cantonese...</i>

10:22.123 --> 10:23.793
Sorry, it's just so rare

10:23.877 --> 10:25.574
to randomly meet somebody
else who speaks it.

10:25.658 --> 10:27.139
Most everybody
speaks Mandarin.

10:27.223 --> 10:30.626
My mom is gonna love this,
a new Cantonese neighbor.

10:31.803 --> 10:33.027
Nice to meet you.

10:33.111 --> 10:33.822
You, too.

10:33.906 --> 10:34.823
Good night.

10:34.907 --> 10:36.380
Bye.

10:46.486 --> 10:48.168
Hey, morning, Chris.

10:48.252 --> 10:50.121
Yo, what's up with the new whip?

10:50.205 --> 10:51.121
It's my uncle's.

10:51.205 --> 10:52.465
I wasn't going near mine
this morning

10:52.549 --> 10:53.488
in case you clowns

10:53.572 --> 10:54.847
- booby-trapped it.
- Damn.

10:54.931 --> 10:56.744
You're starting the day
on defense.

10:56.828 --> 10:58.028
It's crowded today.

10:58.112 --> 11:01.029
Uh, I think I saw an empty spot
up on the right-hand side.

11:01.113 --> 11:02.597
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:02.702 --> 11:04.128
All right.

11:07.507 --> 11:09.646
What?

11:17.690 --> 11:19.386
Yeah!

11:23.145 --> 11:25.053
You really came in early
just for this?

11:25.137 --> 11:26.275
Only 'cause I love you.

11:26.359 --> 11:28.528
Also, I wanted to get you
before you put your guard up.

11:28.612 --> 11:30.832
Happy official birthday,
Chris!

11:33.356 --> 11:35.188
Yeah, happy birthday.

11:35.285 --> 11:36.985
It's pretty good, right?

11:37.069 --> 11:38.424
Thank you.

11:39.598 --> 11:40.825
Just talked to Hondo.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.858
He's running down a contact
who might be able to give us

11:42.942 --> 11:44.860
more information on those kids
from yesterday's shooting.

11:44.944 --> 11:46.740
Good, 'cause right now
we're short on answers

11:46.824 --> 11:47.787
and long on questions.

11:47.871 --> 11:50.099
The two gunmen you took down
aren't saying anything.

11:50.183 --> 11:53.238
And it turns out they go deeper
than just the Russian mob.

11:53.619 --> 11:54.970
They're former
Spetsnaz soldiers?

11:55.054 --> 11:57.146
Yep, Russian Special Forces,

11:57.230 --> 11:59.311
part of a crew
run by this guy.

11:59.395 --> 12:01.772
Victor Sasha, AKA The Baron.

12:01.856 --> 12:04.279
Off the radar
since escaping prison in Moscow.

12:04.363 --> 12:06.048
Recently resurfaced in L.A.,

12:06.132 --> 12:08.016
muscling his way
into organized crime.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.151
How the hell do
three teenage kids

12:09.235 --> 12:10.953
- get in his crosshairs?
- Not sure,

12:11.037 --> 12:14.027
but my guess is it has
something to do with this.

12:14.176 --> 12:15.983
Kid robbed
a quinceaÃ±era dress shop

12:16.067 --> 12:17.224
a little while before
the shoot-out.

12:17.308 --> 12:18.911
Those places tend
to be cash heavy.

12:18.995 --> 12:20.667
Good cover for
money laundering.

12:21.192 --> 12:22.931
That bag looks heavy.
How much cash is in there?

12:23.015 --> 12:24.867
Don't know.
Detectives went to check it out

12:24.951 --> 12:26.238
this morning,
the whole place was burned

12:26.322 --> 12:27.136
to the ground.

12:27.220 --> 12:28.337
Interesting timing.

12:28.421 --> 12:29.753
Store owner was
packing his bags

12:29.837 --> 12:32.282
when Patrol scooped him up.
He's in interrogation.

12:32.408 --> 12:34.899
Street, take Chris
and get him talking.

12:36.049 --> 12:39.313
I hate to think what'll happen
if the Russians find them first.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.675
Deac ironed one of those

12:44.759 --> 12:46.421
onto every shirt
in your locker.

12:46.505 --> 12:48.824
Must have done it last night.
I'm sure Annie helped.

12:48.908 --> 12:51.113
I don't know.
Guy has four kids.

12:51.197 --> 12:52.440
Man can probably iron.

12:52.524 --> 12:53.762
Look, can you just...

12:53.846 --> 12:56.261
Whatever you have planned
this year, can you just not?

12:56.345 --> 12:58.206
Relax,
I'm not doing anything,

12:58.290 --> 13:01.138
which, today, is
my birthday present to you.

13:01.222 --> 13:02.901
Please, you live
for this kind of crap.

13:02.985 --> 13:04.637
Last year, you got Dispatch
to sing to me

13:04.721 --> 13:07.712
- across every frequency in LAPD.
- Yeah.

13:07.807 --> 13:09.223
I mean,
I guess I just know you

13:09.307 --> 13:10.730
a little better now.

13:10.814 --> 13:13.368
You hate the attention,
and I respect that.

13:13.681 --> 13:15.688
I just feel like
I don't deserve it.

13:16.022 --> 13:17.915
I wouldn't say that.

13:20.206 --> 13:21.579
Hey.

13:22.713 --> 13:24.457
The officer who brought you in
said that you were

13:24.541 --> 13:25.715
- getting ready to leave town?
- Yeah,

13:25.799 --> 13:27.700
I just felt
like getting away.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.198
Maybe drive up the coast.

13:29.282 --> 13:30.465
It's been a rough week.

13:30.549 --> 13:31.871
I'd say. First you get robbed,

13:31.955 --> 13:33.985
then your store burns
to the ground.

13:34.228 --> 13:35.215
I got to figure that's

13:35.299 --> 13:36.965
the least of your worries
now, though,

13:37.049 --> 13:38.878
given how unhappy
the Russians seem to be.

13:38.962 --> 13:40.746
Look, I just wanted
to sell dresses, all right?

13:40.830 --> 13:42.901
I didn't want any part of any...

13:42.985 --> 13:44.037
Washing their dirty money?

13:44.121 --> 13:45.143
They threatened my family.

13:45.227 --> 13:47.115
If they threaten you,
then you come clean to us;

13:47.199 --> 13:50.113
If not, laundering money, that's
a five-year mandatory minimum.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.558
I didn't have any choice.

13:51.642 --> 13:53.088
Then talk to us.

13:53.172 --> 13:55.261
You help us, we help you.

13:58.424 --> 14:03.566
Look, the store sells maybe
three dresses a day.

14:03.650 --> 14:06.235
Maybe five during prom season.

14:07.064 --> 14:09.649
But on the books,
they got me selling hundreds.

14:09.826 --> 14:13.790
Online orders, phone orders,
but nothing ever ships.

14:13.907 --> 14:15.346
It's all bogus.

14:16.031 --> 14:19.243
They deliver stacks of cash,
I deposit into an account.

14:19.408 --> 14:21.617
With all the fake receipts,
they make it look legit.

14:21.701 --> 14:23.816
So what, you got a joint account
with the Russians?

14:23.900 --> 14:24.862
No.

14:24.946 --> 14:29.087
No, the Russians are like,
uh, security, I guess.

14:29.580 --> 14:30.996
They work for a bigger fish.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.871
- Who?
- I don't know.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.104
I swear.

14:34.188 --> 14:35.993
The kid who robbed the store,

14:36.077 --> 14:38.301
you think he had any idea
about the dirty money,

14:38.385 --> 14:39.863
- what he was taking?
- No, no, no,

14:39.947 --> 14:41.129
he was scared.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.242
He just grabbed a bag and ran.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.340
I tried to warn him
what would happen if he took it,

14:45.424 --> 14:46.595
but...

14:47.525 --> 14:49.113
over $2 million.

14:49.197 --> 14:50.879
- Two million?
- Yeah.

14:50.963 --> 14:53.126
He and his friends are
as good as dead.

14:56.642 --> 14:58.121
Some things in here
are perishable,

14:58.205 --> 14:59.746
so just make sure they get
to the right shelves.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.001
Excuse,
please, Miss Ivy.

15:02.267 --> 15:04.485
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

15:04.572 --> 15:05.925
Sergeant Harrelson.

15:06.009 --> 15:07.847
This... is Miss Ivy LaFleur.

15:07.931 --> 15:09.574
She's the real saint
around here.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.316
Keeps this place up
and running,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.504
feeding anyone
who's hungry.

15:13.588 --> 15:15.418
I help out a little,
of course.

15:15.502 --> 15:17.715
Fill her shelves with donations
from my restaurant.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.215
Looks like quite
the operation.

15:19.299 --> 15:21.066
Ivy, I was hoping

15:21.150 --> 15:22.745
you might be able to assist
the sergeant.

15:22.829 --> 15:24.543
- How can I help you?
- Saint tells me

15:24.627 --> 15:26.923
you may know a young man
by the name of James.

15:27.199 --> 15:28.650
He was injured
in a robbery yesterday.

15:28.734 --> 15:29.964
We don't know much
about him.

15:30.048 --> 15:32.397
James Bernard.
I'm sorry to hear what happened.

15:32.481 --> 15:34.456
- Won't say I'm surprised.
- How do you mean?

15:34.540 --> 15:37.324
James moved here from
the Caribbean a few years ago,

15:37.408 --> 15:39.298
orphaned by Hurricane Maria.

15:39.507 --> 15:40.582
I felt bad for him,

15:40.666 --> 15:42.432
so I put him to work
in our kitchen.

15:42.516 --> 15:44.603
After a few shifts,
he stopped showing up.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.582
James didn't want to work

15:46.666 --> 15:48.415
and wanted easy money.

15:48.549 --> 15:49.659
That boy is trouble.

15:49.743 --> 15:51.931
James isn't the only one
I'm worried about.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.190
There were two kids
with him yesterday.

15:54.274 --> 15:56.394
This is Manny's.
Oh, God.

15:56.478 --> 15:58.806
Not him and Fabi.
You know them?

15:59.184 --> 16:01.871
Manny Kameka,
and his older sister, Fabi.

16:01.955 --> 16:03.848
They, too, arrived
after the hurricane.

16:03.932 --> 16:05.175
Oh, God.

16:05.259 --> 16:06.262
So broken.

16:06.346 --> 16:07.622
So alone.

16:07.706 --> 16:09.268
Those two are good kids.

16:09.352 --> 16:11.379
Miss LaFleur, they're both
in very serious danger.

16:11.463 --> 16:13.245
Do you have any idea
where they may be?

16:13.329 --> 16:17.170
I don't,
but Manny called earlier.

16:17.254 --> 16:20.431
I didn't answer,
figured he was just checking in.

16:22.205 --> 16:24.063
It's not even ringing.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.884
May I see your phone,
please?

16:25.986 --> 16:27.914
You can trust him.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.787
Thank you.

16:32.731 --> 16:33.918
Yo, Luca.

16:34.002 --> 16:35.191
I just sent you
the number of one of

16:35.275 --> 16:36.159
the kids we're looking for.

16:36.243 --> 16:37.262
I need you to run a cell trace.

16:37.346 --> 16:38.801
Okay. Putting it in
right now, boss.

16:38.885 --> 16:40.090
Hang tight, it's looking.

16:40.174 --> 16:41.167
So you can trace a call

16:41.251 --> 16:42.268
even if his phone is dead?

16:42.352 --> 16:44.535
Not much the police can't do
nowadays.

16:44.619 --> 16:45.957
It may not tell us
where he is now,

16:46.041 --> 16:47.629
but maybe where he was
when he tried to make the call.

16:47.713 --> 16:50.496
Last ping came from an area
northeast of downtown,

16:50.580 --> 16:52.090
between Scott Avenue
and Brendon Boulevard.

16:52.174 --> 16:53.012
<i>That's Victor Heights.</i>

16:53.096 --> 16:54.582
T <i>here's a homeless
encampment there.</i>

16:54.666 --> 16:55.570
<i>Lot of folks from</i>

16:55.654 --> 16:57.506
the Caribbean community.

16:57.590 --> 16:59.361
Maybe Manny and Fabi...

16:59.445 --> 17:01.143
- You hear that, Luca?
<i>- Yeah. Sure thing.</i>

17:01.227 --> 17:03.237
<i>- I'll meet you there.</i>
- Thank you.

17:03.321 --> 17:04.733
<i>- Yeah. Sure.</i>
- Both of you.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.483
Fabi,
what are we doing?

17:16.608 --> 17:18.281
We should have given the money
to the police.

17:18.366 --> 17:19.476
Don't be stupid.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.483
Money like this,
we can't trust anyone.

17:23.438 --> 17:26.388
We just need to find James,
and we can all leave town.

17:29.945 --> 17:30.845
Luca.

17:30.929 --> 17:32.100
Yo.

17:32.205 --> 17:35.012
- Red tent, blue tarp. Near the back.
- Got it.

17:36.895 --> 17:38.626
Hondo, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

17:38.710 --> 17:40.085
We got company.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.456
All right, move.
I got an idea.

17:44.737 --> 17:47.744
<i>Speaking Russian...</i>

17:53.014 --> 17:54.186
Fabi?

17:54.826 --> 17:56.243
Take it easy, take it easy.

17:56.327 --> 17:57.812
Listen to me,
we've only got a second.

17:57.896 --> 17:59.272
There are men with guns here
looking for you.

17:59.356 --> 18:01.281
Get back inside that tent,
get down low on the ground,

18:01.365 --> 18:02.514
and stay there.
Do not come out

18:02.598 --> 18:03.586
until I come back for you.
Do you understand?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.856
- Yes, we understand.
- Get in there, go.

18:09.036 --> 18:10.537
Okay, they must have split up.

18:10.621 --> 18:12.109
I'm tracking one
along the west edge.

18:12.193 --> 18:13.116
He came from
right over there.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.108
- Yeah.
- Okay. Luca, go left. I'll go right.

18:31.267 --> 18:32.922
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

18:35.955 --> 18:38.744
Get over. Get over.
Give me your arms.

18:44.259 --> 18:45.781
Move, move!

18:45.898 --> 18:47.528
Police! Drop the weapons!

19:07.512 --> 19:09.003
Aw, come on.

19:16.427 --> 19:17.886
That must hurt.

19:19.177 --> 19:20.912
It's not my first bullet.

19:20.996 --> 19:21.998
It will heal.

19:22.082 --> 19:24.591
Yeah, most of them do,
except the last.

19:24.675 --> 19:26.651
You know I'm not gonna give you
what you want,

19:26.735 --> 19:27.912
so why am I still here?

19:27.996 --> 19:30.050
The question I have is,
how are you still here?

19:31.128 --> 19:32.881
If-if I hired you
to protect my millions,

19:32.965 --> 19:35.016
and you got taken to school
by some teenagers...

19:35.713 --> 19:38.387
...you'd be the first person
to receive the last bullet.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.503
Who's behind
the money laundering operation?

19:42.265 --> 19:43.863
Who's two million
are you chasing?

19:45.374 --> 19:48.255
Telling you that
would be a sure way to die.

19:48.339 --> 19:51.029
We know you and your comrades
are only guns for hire.

19:51.113 --> 19:52.375
Who are you working for?

19:52.459 --> 19:53.901
We can offer you protection.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.730
There is no protection
from someone like this.

19:57.627 --> 19:59.050
He's a ghost.

20:02.086 --> 20:03.832
Even The Baron fears him.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.419
Where are we
on the money laundering?

20:10.503 --> 20:12.107
We nail down
who's behind it yet?

20:12.191 --> 20:13.497
No, but we're not alone.

20:13.581 --> 20:15.560
Organized Crime has suspected
an operation

20:15.644 --> 20:17.372
in the Fashion District
for years.

20:17.456 --> 20:19.115
They've been monitoring
a dozen banks,

20:19.199 --> 20:21.321
never been able
to nail it down.

20:21.435 --> 20:23.521
Whoever's behind it has moved
tens of millions

20:23.605 --> 20:24.622
through the pipeline.

20:24.706 --> 20:26.529
Well, sometimes the bigger
the crime syndicate,

20:26.613 --> 20:28.232
the easier it is to hide
in plain sight.

20:28.316 --> 20:29.501
What do we know so far?

20:29.585 --> 20:31.880
Once the dress store owner
deposits the cash,

20:31.964 --> 20:33.068
it's wired out,

20:33.152 --> 20:35.615
bouncing between foreign banks
and digital accounts.

20:35.699 --> 20:37.310
It is impossible to see
where it lands.

20:37.394 --> 20:40.068
This name appears
more than once, "Kinari Holdings."

20:40.152 --> 20:42.169
It's an old LLC tied
to a few banks

20:42.253 --> 20:43.490
with California
routing numbers,

20:43.574 --> 20:45.560
but the, uh, accounts
were shut down years ago.

20:45.644 --> 20:48.163
Tan reached out to a buddy
at the Franchise Tax Board.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.162
They're checking their archives
for any filings

20:50.246 --> 20:51.451
related to Kinari Holdings.

20:51.535 --> 20:53.941
All right, let me know
if anything turns up.

20:57.704 --> 20:59.389
How's birthday fest?

20:59.473 --> 21:01.588
Anyone out-Hondo Hondo yet?

21:01.672 --> 21:04.152
You didn't see the monitors
in Eagle's Nest this morning?

21:04.236 --> 21:05.309
No, what did I miss?

21:05.393 --> 21:08.472
Rocker made my face
the screen saver on every TV.

21:08.754 --> 21:11.255
Got a photo from my Uncle Sarzo
of my 12th birthday.

21:11.339 --> 21:12.560
I got to see this.

21:12.644 --> 21:14.714
You think I'm gonna let that
stay up?

21:16.004 --> 21:18.457
Hey, what's wrong
with you?

21:19.348 --> 21:20.919
I just got off the phone
with Bonnie.

21:21.003 --> 21:21.880
I think something's up.

21:21.964 --> 21:23.957
Trouble in paradise?
What did you do?

21:24.163 --> 21:26.403
Well, nothing,
I don't think.

21:28.906 --> 21:30.412
All right. We went
out to dinner last night.

21:30.496 --> 21:31.466
It was super romantic.

21:31.550 --> 21:32.886
Everything's great.

21:33.026 --> 21:34.216
Then coming home,

21:34.300 --> 21:35.904
this thing happened
in the hallway of our building.

21:35.988 --> 21:37.529
What thing?
Well, we have a new neighbor.

21:37.613 --> 21:38.982
She was being hassled
by some guy.

21:39.066 --> 21:40.872
So you stepped in.
Yeah, it was no big deal.

21:40.956 --> 21:42.552
I basically badged the guy,
kicked him out.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.699
But after that
the mood was gone.

21:44.787 --> 21:46.005
Bonnie wasn't the same.

21:46.089 --> 21:48.755
This neighbor you rescued,
describe her.

21:48.839 --> 21:51.519
20s, Chinese, athletic.

21:52.530 --> 21:55.324
Is "athletic"
a code word for hot?

21:56.635 --> 21:57.953
Bonnie's not jealous.

21:58.037 --> 21:59.458
No, for real.
That's not her style.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.922
- Did you ask her what the matter was?
- Yeah. She said nothing,

22:02.006 --> 22:03.240
but something's
definitely the matter.

22:03.324 --> 22:04.708
Well, then you need to
ask her again.

22:04.792 --> 22:06.878
And don't just ask
yes or no questions.

22:06.962 --> 22:08.699
If you want her to open up,

22:08.789 --> 22:10.841
you're gonna have to ask
open-ended questions.

22:10.925 --> 22:12.537
And actively listen,

22:12.621 --> 22:14.944
and work to deactivate
her negative feelings.

22:15.666 --> 22:18.138
What? I took the hostage
negotiation course.

22:18.222 --> 22:19.534
Is this really any different?

22:21.923 --> 22:23.983
My buddy over at
the Franchise Tax Board.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.803
He found an old address
for Kinari Holdings,

22:25.887 --> 22:27.256
- and it's local.
- Ah, worth checking out.

22:27.340 --> 22:29.671
All right, you fill Hicks in,
I'm gonna let Hondo know.

22:34.308 --> 22:35.700
Clear.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.287
Clear.

22:38.371 --> 22:39.381
This was the address listed

22:39.465 --> 22:40.936
on a tax filing
for Kinari Holdings

22:41.020 --> 22:42.373
from almost ten years ago.

22:42.457 --> 22:44.178
Judging by the lengths they went
to cover their tracks,

22:44.262 --> 22:46.371
my guess is they're
long gone by now.

22:47.622 --> 22:49.043
Up there.

22:53.191 --> 22:54.723
LAPD.

22:56.438 --> 22:57.538
Ma'am.

22:57.622 --> 22:59.030
We're looking for
Kinari Holdings.

22:59.114 --> 23:01.692
Lucky you,
you found it.

23:01.999 --> 23:03.822
What exactly is it
you do here?

23:03.906 --> 23:05.467
Uh, knit mostly.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.256
Sometimes the phone rings,
and I get instructions.

23:08.340 --> 23:09.592
Instructions to do what?

23:09.676 --> 23:13.089
Start a new corporation,
close down an old one,

23:13.173 --> 23:15.701
open a new bank account,
move funds.

23:15.785 --> 23:18.432
It-it... changes, actually.

23:18.516 --> 23:19.433
It never crossed your mind

23:19.517 --> 23:20.397
that this place might be a front

23:20.481 --> 23:21.958
for some sort of
illegal activity?

23:22.940 --> 23:24.436
Not my place to ask.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.147
- Everything I do is legal.
- Too bad

23:26.231 --> 23:27.524
that's not the case
with your employer.

23:27.608 --> 23:28.967
Far as we can tell,
he's neck deep

23:29.051 --> 23:29.819
in organized crime.

23:29.903 --> 23:31.300
You must have met him
at some point.

23:31.384 --> 23:32.944
Somebody hired you,
somebody pays you.

23:33.028 --> 23:35.332
It-it was
an online job listing.

23:35.483 --> 23:38.270
I've never met the owner.
Never met anyone.

23:41.021 --> 23:42.139
That's the hospital.

23:42.223 --> 23:43.707
James just woke up.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.606
Thank you.

23:54.841 --> 23:57.170
Doctor said it'll be a minute
before we can go in

23:57.254 --> 23:58.248
and see James.

23:58.332 --> 23:59.061
What was that about?

23:59.145 --> 24:02.115
Homeless kid like James
has nothing even close

24:02.199 --> 24:03.475
to medical insurance.

24:03.559 --> 24:06.433
I just want to make sure
he still gets decent care.

24:07.313 --> 24:08.431
You're paying his bills?

24:08.515 --> 24:11.334
James' story,
it's my story, too.

24:11.418 --> 24:14.364
A teenager orphaned
by a hurricane.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.676
Only in my case,

24:16.815 --> 24:19.656
it wasn't a storm
that killed my family.

24:21.345 --> 24:23.160
Colonialism did.

24:23.365 --> 24:24.517
They starved to death.

24:24.601 --> 24:25.986
Resources were scarce

24:26.070 --> 24:28.246
before the storm and after.

24:28.732 --> 24:30.839
There simply wasn't
enough to go around,

24:30.923 --> 24:32.600
not for those
who weren't white, anyway.

24:32.684 --> 24:34.592
So you left the islands
and came to L.A.

24:34.676 --> 24:35.694
looking for something better.

24:35.778 --> 24:36.819
Imagine my surprise

24:36.903 --> 24:41.012
when I find
same hardships here.

24:41.345 --> 24:42.990
They're inescapable maybe.

24:43.074 --> 24:45.296
Even in chess,
you know?

24:45.443 --> 24:47.362
Just by playing
the white pieces...

24:47.446 --> 24:49.785
You already have a better
chance of winning.

24:49.974 --> 24:51.514
I heard that from my pops.

24:51.598 --> 24:53.864
Doesn't mean we can't
make things better, though.

24:53.948 --> 24:55.317
You and me,

24:55.942 --> 24:58.285
we're alike in that way,
I imagine.

24:59.177 --> 25:00.795
Doctor says you can
see him now.

25:00.879 --> 25:02.418
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

25:07.468 --> 25:09.780
Fabi and Manny, where are they?

25:09.864 --> 25:11.276
That's why I'm here, James.

25:11.360 --> 25:12.553
I need your help to find them.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.264
They in trouble?
In trouble, no,

25:14.348 --> 25:15.912
but they're definitely
in danger.

25:15.996 --> 25:18.353
I think the people who did this
to you are after them.

25:18.437 --> 25:21.309
Do you know where they are?
Where they might hide?

25:21.953 --> 25:23.231
James, this man,

25:23.315 --> 25:24.936
he probably saved your life.

25:25.020 --> 25:26.170
Let him do the same

25:26.254 --> 25:28.051
for Fabi and Manny.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.920
There's this place that
Manny goes

25:34.059 --> 25:36.051
in the Warehouse District.

25:36.766 --> 25:39.389
Old mill or something.

25:39.523 --> 25:41.425
Said it reminds him
of a cathedral.

25:41.509 --> 25:42.756
Where do I find it?

25:42.840 --> 25:45.637
On Brookside,
close to Florence.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.312
Thanks, James.

25:47.927 --> 25:50.812
We have to go somewhere.
Get out of town.

25:50.896 --> 25:53.535
No, I told you,
not without James.

26:00.448 --> 26:01.996
They found us, Fabi.

26:02.349 --> 26:03.707
They found us.

26:05.233 --> 26:06.972
Go, go, go, go, go.

26:24.358 --> 26:25.889
We're not here for you.

26:25.973 --> 26:27.995
We only want the money.

26:28.980 --> 26:32.606
You give it to us,
I promise we won't hurt you.

26:51.996 --> 26:53.413
Somebody beat us
to the punch.

26:53.497 --> 26:54.415
How?

26:54.499 --> 26:55.514
We'll figure that out later.

26:55.598 --> 26:57.124
Right now we got to get inside
and find those kids

26:57.208 --> 26:58.304
before The Baron does.

26:58.388 --> 27:00.121
Remember, these guys are
former special forces,

27:00.205 --> 27:01.225
so fill the gaps...

27:01.309 --> 27:03.138
- Stay liquid.
- Let's move.

27:03.586 --> 27:05.468
Luca, Chris,
clear the room to the left.

27:05.552 --> 27:07.659
Deacon, Street, Tan,
you're with me.

27:10.761 --> 27:12.528
Lights.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.286
Stay here.

27:48.719 --> 27:50.224
No matter what.

27:56.367 --> 27:57.770
I'm coming out.

28:00.228 --> 28:01.139
Don't shoot.

28:01.223 --> 28:03.666
Where's the other one?
Your sister?

28:03.750 --> 28:06.614
I-I don't know.
I lost her.

28:07.761 --> 28:09.347
What about the money?

28:09.431 --> 28:12.270
It's hidden.
I-I can take you,

28:12.546 --> 28:15.287
but promise me
you don't hurt me.

28:19.018 --> 28:20.755
Show me.

28:40.136 --> 28:42.591
You know what will happen
if you're lying to us?

28:43.677 --> 28:45.263
I'm not lying to you.

28:58.975 --> 29:00.163
Deacon.

29:00.607 --> 29:01.825
Hey, it's okay.

29:01.909 --> 29:03.760
You're safe.
You can come out now. Come on.

29:06.029 --> 29:08.426
They took my brother.
They took Manny.

29:08.510 --> 29:09.655
- Where?
- I don't know.

29:09.739 --> 29:12.585
He-he was leading them away
to save me.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.077
Told him he'd take them
to the money.

29:14.161 --> 29:15.799
That's hard to do
with the money right there.

29:15.883 --> 29:16.901
These guys aren't stupid.

29:16.985 --> 29:17.897
It's not gonna take long

29:17.981 --> 29:19.266
till they realize
the kid's bluffing.

29:19.350 --> 29:21.521
And when they do they're
gonna have no use for him.

29:21.874 --> 29:22.792
Street,

29:22.876 --> 29:24.265
get Fabi someplace safe.

29:24.601 --> 29:26.013
Let's end this.

29:30.934 --> 29:31.904
24-David.

29:31.988 --> 29:33.375
Front half of
the warehouse is clear.

29:33.459 --> 29:35.278
- No sign of them.
- Roger that, Chris.

29:35.362 --> 29:38.530
I warned you what will happen
if you're playing us.

29:38.614 --> 29:41.054
I-I'm not,
I s... I swear.

29:45.282 --> 29:46.367
Let's move.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.843
I-I'm just a little lost
right now.

29:47.927 --> 29:51.296
I'm trying to, uh, remember
where-where I hid it.

29:51.380 --> 29:54.048
Nobody forgets where
they hid $2 million.

29:54.132 --> 29:56.021
Take us to the money now.

29:56.192 --> 29:57.694
Lights.

29:57.778 --> 29:59.508
Unless you're ready to die.

29:59.592 --> 30:01.575
No, no, no.

30:01.982 --> 30:04.038
LAPD! Drop your gun!
LAPD!

30:17.610 --> 30:19.122
They're splitting up.

30:19.206 --> 30:20.065
You two go right.

30:20.149 --> 30:21.018
I got The Baron.

30:21.102 --> 30:22.641
Move, move!

30:31.697 --> 30:32.916
That's far enough.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.020
You ain't getting out of here,
you got to know that.

30:35.104 --> 30:36.719
Then I guess we have problem.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.377
Kid, you okay?

30:49.461 --> 30:50.518
Yeah. Yeah.

30:50.602 --> 30:51.631
You stay right here.

30:51.715 --> 30:52.881
Don't you move.
You understand?

30:52.965 --> 30:54.223
Okay.

31:01.104 --> 31:02.532
Hold up.

31:03.284 --> 31:04.579
Deac, circle back.

31:15.501 --> 31:16.863
Don't even think about it.

31:16.947 --> 31:17.994
Drop your weapon.

31:18.078 --> 31:19.951
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

31:23.093 --> 31:25.282
30-David,
one suspect in custody.

31:28.117 --> 31:31.000
20-David, in foot pursuit
of The Baron.

32:33.948 --> 32:35.589
You're done.

32:36.629 --> 32:38.317
20-David to Command.

32:38.479 --> 32:40.267
Final suspect in custody.

32:45.540 --> 32:48.130
These officers here are gonna
take you to the hospital.

32:48.704 --> 32:50.520
Figured you might want to see
your friend.

32:50.632 --> 32:51.534
Yeah.

32:51.618 --> 32:53.306
Oh, Manny?

32:53.396 --> 32:54.651
Yeah?

32:55.643 --> 32:57.462
Got something of yours.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.068
Always had faith
it would turn up.

33:01.277 --> 33:02.338
Thank you.

33:02.422 --> 33:04.633
Just happy to have the chance
to get it back to you.

33:05.205 --> 33:06.570
Take care.

33:16.501 --> 33:18.829
Still want to know
who was behind all this.

33:19.066 --> 33:20.545
We put enough pressure
on The Baron,

33:20.629 --> 33:22.323
- maybe he'll tell us.
- Guys,

33:22.407 --> 33:24.387
we saved the kids.
We live to fight another day.

33:24.471 --> 33:26.043
Let's just take the win
on this one.

33:26.399 --> 33:27.858
Since no one's gonna claim
this money,

33:27.942 --> 33:29.669
I guess that means
that we get to keep it, right?

33:29.753 --> 33:31.212
Nice try, Luca.

33:31.689 --> 33:33.012
Give me the bag.

33:33.096 --> 33:35.423
Before I make you empty
your pockets, give me the bag.

33:37.751 --> 33:39.392
Let's go home.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.297
It has to be Tan.

33:51.381 --> 33:53.069
He snuck off the moment
we got back.

33:53.153 --> 33:54.538
I should have followed him.

33:54.622 --> 33:56.773
Here, I'll help
you take them down.

33:56.857 --> 33:59.131
Don't want your uncle's truck
to float away.

34:04.002 --> 34:05.782
You really didn't do

34:05.866 --> 34:07.939
anything to surprise me today,
did you?

34:10.722 --> 34:12.547
Oh, I knew it!

34:13.277 --> 34:14.931
Okay, get it over with.

34:15.016 --> 34:16.422
Come on.

34:20.050 --> 34:21.509
What's this?

34:24.833 --> 34:26.129
Skydiving lessons?

34:26.213 --> 34:26.972
Mm-hmm.

34:27.056 --> 34:30.116
No way.
Are these real?

34:30.199 --> 34:32.378
Yeah. Overheard you, uh,
telling Luca last month

34:32.462 --> 34:34.154
you wanted to try it
sometime.

34:34.237 --> 34:35.712
And, look,

34:35.799 --> 34:37.476
I know,

34:37.813 --> 34:41.550
we've been at a confusing
crossroads with us,

34:41.634 --> 34:44.745
but I just wanted to get you
an actual gift this year,

34:44.829 --> 34:46.204
something special.

34:47.929 --> 34:49.446
Two tickets, huh?

34:50.264 --> 34:54.034
Maybe I'll take Tan just
so I can push him off the plane.

34:54.119 --> 34:55.494
They're good for a whole year.

34:55.578 --> 34:59.440
I-I don't know where we'll be
personally by then,

34:59.524 --> 35:03.515
but maybe a little closer
to where we both want to be.

35:03.844 --> 35:04.973
Thanks.

35:05.057 --> 35:06.618
Happy birthday.

35:10.887 --> 35:12.776
Hey, babe, I'm home.

35:13.134 --> 35:14.626
Ah, what's that smell?

35:16.549 --> 35:18.306
You got takeout from Wang's?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.486
Mmm!

35:23.570 --> 35:25.323
All right, this is
even better than I remember.

35:25.407 --> 35:26.847
I can't believe you drove
all the way out to Alhambra.

35:26.931 --> 35:29.737
I didn't.
Joy made those,

35:29.821 --> 35:32.149
as a thank-you for last night.

35:36.275 --> 35:39.331
Babe, all right, we-we got
to talk about what's wrong.

35:39.415 --> 35:42.238
I told you nothing's wrong.
I know, but maybe

35:42.322 --> 35:45.438
"everything's fine"
means "everything's not fine."

35:45.923 --> 35:49.511
So, please just tell me
what's upsetting you.

35:49.595 --> 35:50.598
I want to understand.

35:50.682 --> 35:54.551
Honestly, I don't know.

35:54.635 --> 35:59.056
I guess
seeing you with Joy,

35:59.321 --> 36:00.871
and you two bonding

36:00.955 --> 36:03.649
over Cantonese
made me feel...

36:05.442 --> 36:06.700
I don't know, insecure.

36:06.784 --> 36:09.065
Why? Uh, there's nothing
to be jealous of.

36:09.149 --> 36:11.089
No, it's not that.
It's just...

36:12.802 --> 36:14.654
Part of me has always wondered

36:14.738 --> 36:16.901
if you would have been
better off with someone Asian.

36:16.985 --> 36:19.271
Someone who-who understands
your culture

36:19.355 --> 36:21.659
- and your background better.
- What?

36:21.743 --> 36:23.158
Why-why would you think that?

36:23.242 --> 36:25.173
I don't know,
I've just always had this voice

36:25.257 --> 36:26.501
in the back of my head.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.674
Bonnie, I love you.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.189
And it's got nothing to do
with race,

36:31.273 --> 36:33.353
and everything to do with
how beautiful you are

36:33.437 --> 36:35.554
as a person, inside and out.

36:36.011 --> 36:39.699
You don't have to speak
Cantonese or make pork buns

36:39.783 --> 36:41.320
to make me happy.

36:41.780 --> 36:43.103
Although it wouldn't hurt.

36:43.187 --> 36:44.405
Besides,

36:44.489 --> 36:46.342
we've got a lifetime to learn
about each other's

36:46.426 --> 36:48.390
culture and traditions.

36:48.812 --> 36:50.064
Yeah.

36:50.148 --> 36:52.288
I'm dying to know more
about yours.

36:53.547 --> 36:57.516
County fairs,
beauty pageants, cow tipping.

36:58.555 --> 37:00.808
What can you find out about me
in the bedroom

37:00.892 --> 37:02.376
that you can't out here?

37:02.460 --> 37:03.962
- I think I'll see.
- Oh, yeah?

37:04.046 --> 37:05.634
Yeah.

37:06.336 --> 37:07.586
Okay.

37:11.415 --> 37:12.596
Hey, Pop?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.476
Hmm?

37:14.649 --> 37:15.956
That's a great pic.
Never seen this one before.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.830
I try not to get you
too jealous.

37:17.914 --> 37:20.101
Jealous?
Of what?

37:21.302 --> 37:23.462
How good looking I was
back in the day.

37:23.546 --> 37:25.231
Oh, Lord.

37:25.315 --> 37:27.871
Hey, look here, that little bit
of swagger you got

37:27.978 --> 37:29.718
had to come from somewhere.

37:30.851 --> 37:31.840
Yeah, these were,

37:31.924 --> 37:34.054
these were some
righteous times, baby.

37:34.616 --> 37:35.791
You know,
I've heard plenty about

37:35.875 --> 37:37.181
the good old days
in the Panthers,

37:37.265 --> 37:38.716
and you fighting the good fight.

37:38.801 --> 37:40.150
But last night, when Saint was
talking about

37:40.234 --> 37:41.522
you leaving the party,

37:41.755 --> 37:42.995
first time I got
a different vibe.

37:43.079 --> 37:44.730
Yeah, leaving wasn't
an easy decision.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.541
See, when I joined,
I felt like we were united,

37:49.625 --> 37:53.398
like we had a common cause
that I believed in.

37:54.329 --> 37:56.393
You know, I-I know it's
the opposite side of the coin,

37:56.477 --> 38:00.187
but a lot like I remember
how you felt

38:00.516 --> 38:02.796
when you first joined the LAPD.

38:03.930 --> 38:05.682
I wanted to make
a positive impact.

38:05.766 --> 38:08.362
I just assumed that the other
cops around me felt the same.

38:08.446 --> 38:11.757
Yeah. See, at one point
the party spilt.

38:13.133 --> 38:15.531
Different factions,
different agenda.

38:15.766 --> 38:18.531
Wasn't long before we were
killing each other.

38:18.766 --> 38:20.307
We were supposed to be
fighting oppression,

38:20.391 --> 38:22.635
instead we ended up
oppressing ourselves.

38:22.719 --> 38:24.400
See, I didn't sign up for that.

38:24.484 --> 38:25.784
So I got out.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.657
Do you regret it?
Sometimes.

38:28.344 --> 38:30.101
But my bigger regret...

38:30.973 --> 38:32.951
is what happened
to the organization.

38:33.035 --> 38:35.900
We had the potential
for so much more.

38:35.984 --> 38:38.009
Give your all to something
only to see it fall short

38:38.093 --> 38:39.718
of what it should be.

38:39.802 --> 38:40.953
I feel you.

38:41.037 --> 38:43.074
That's why I respect
what you're doing, son.

38:43.158 --> 38:45.031
I respect that,

38:45.736 --> 38:48.349
even though the department
is failing around you,

38:48.433 --> 38:52.142
you still got the strength
to try to make it even better.

38:52.226 --> 38:54.386
Yeah, well, only time will tell
if I got it right or not.

38:54.470 --> 38:56.259
It's about the journey, son.

38:56.439 --> 38:58.479
It's always about the journey.

39:01.094 --> 39:02.593
Keep fighting the good fight.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.626
I guess we got more in common
than just good looks, huh?

39:06.710 --> 39:08.097
I guess so.

39:10.321 --> 39:11.768
Good night, son.

39:11.852 --> 39:13.281
Good night, Pop.

39:22.433 --> 39:23.551
Hey, Luca, what's up?

39:23.635 --> 39:24.666
You still at HQ?

39:24.750 --> 39:26.379
Yeah, I kind of
went down a rabbit hole

39:26.463 --> 39:28.480
looking into
old corporate filings

39:28.564 --> 39:30.228
for, uh, Kinari Holdings.

39:30.312 --> 39:32.025
I managed to trace it
all the way back

39:32.109 --> 39:33.642
to the original incorporation.

39:33.726 --> 39:35.579
So you know who formed
the company? You got a name?

39:35.663 --> 39:38.449
Some guy,
Rodrigo Lopez de Segura.

39:38.533 --> 39:41.229
The only this is, there is
no Rodrigo Lopez de Segura,

39:41.313 --> 39:42.694
<i>at least not living anyways.</i>

39:42.778 --> 39:43.580
What do you mean?

39:43.664 --> 39:44.955
The only dude I could find
by that name

39:45.039 --> 39:46.632
lived in the 16th century.

39:46.716 --> 39:48.361
Some kind of chess master.

39:48.445 --> 39:50.151
He invented a famous
move called the...

39:50.235 --> 39:52.085
The Ruy Lopez opening.

39:52.169 --> 39:53.774
Yeah, how'd you know that?

40:10.766 --> 40:12.017
I've been sitting here
kicking myself

40:12.101 --> 40:13.711
for not seeing it sooner.

40:14.721 --> 40:17.078
The Baron's men showing up
to the homeless camp,

40:17.836 --> 40:19.711
them beating us to the mill.

40:20.523 --> 40:22.935
You used me and my team
to hunt down those kids.

40:23.019 --> 40:26.205
That's a serious accusation
without any kind of proof.

40:26.289 --> 40:28.328
And that's not a denial.

40:28.823 --> 40:30.612
We get one life, Hondo.

40:31.649 --> 40:34.023
Some do as they must,

40:34.505 --> 40:36.679
others do as they please.

40:36.832 --> 40:38.275
I choose the latter.

40:38.359 --> 40:40.085
You were willing
to kill those kids

40:40.169 --> 40:41.478
to get your dirty money back.

40:41.562 --> 40:44.578
Money comes and goes.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.244
But I've been building
something in this community

40:47.328 --> 40:49.798
since before my time
with the Panthers.

40:49.985 --> 40:53.281
Everything I have I've earned,

40:53.749 --> 40:57.031
including my people's trust.

40:57.971 --> 41:00.312
You may have them fooled
but not me.

41:00.938 --> 41:02.274
It's only gonna take one mistake

41:02.358 --> 41:04.965
for the LAPD to come
knocking on your door.

41:06.051 --> 41:07.906
And I'll be watching you.

41:08.491 --> 41:10.910
I'll have to be very careful,
then.

41:12.449 --> 41:13.889
Take care, Sergeant.
