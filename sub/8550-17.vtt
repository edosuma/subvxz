UH-OH.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.898
HEY, DON'T LOOK
AT ME.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.833
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

13:24.872 --> 13:27.240
STEVEN...

13:27.307 --> 13:28.842
STEVEN?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.343
STEVEN!

13:30.410 --> 13:32.279
YES, IRENE?

13:33.313 --> 13:34.948
TODAY'S ASSIGNMENT
IS POULTRY.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.683
WHERE'S YOUR BIRD?

13:36.749 --> 13:37.985
IN THE FRIDGE.

13:38.051 --> 13:41.088
I'M NOT HAPPY
WITH MY GRADE IN BREAD.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.156
I'M BAKING
A MAKE-UP LOAF.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.358
WELL, I ADMIRE
YOUR PERSISTENCE.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.095
YOU'LL ALSO ADMIRE
MY NEW SECRET INGREDIENT.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.465
I'VE INVENTED NEW
SUPERACTIVE URK YEAST!

13:52.532 --> 13:54.001
URK YEAST?

13:54.067 --> 13:56.336
ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE,
DOESN'T IT?

13:56.403 --> 13:59.106
I TOOK ORDINARY YEAST--
ASCOMYCETOUS FUNGI--

13:59.172 --> 14:02.075

JUST BAKE IT, STEVEN,

JUST BAKE IT.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.880
MMM!

14:06.947 --> 14:09.749
OH, CASSIE LYNN!

14:09.816 --> 14:12.119

14:12.185 --> 14:14.521
YOUR CHICKEN
SMELLS DELICIOUS.

14:14.587 --> 14:15.989
WHO CARES!

14:16.056 --> 14:18.992
MY HANDS ARE ROUGH,
MY HAIR IS LIMP,

14:19.059 --> 14:22.295
AND I'VE GOT
A GIZZARD STAIN
ON MY SHIRT.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.697
BUT YOU'RE LEARNING
TO COOK.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.500
DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL WONDERFULLY GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.102
OH, GET A LIFE.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.675
STICK A FORK IN ME,
MISS STEUBEN,

14:35.742 --> 14:37.110
I'M DONE.

OH, LAURA, WHAT
A BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION!

14:40.380 --> 14:41.714
MMM. PERFECTION.

14:41.781 --> 14:46.019
SEE WHAT CAN HAPPEN
WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN
AND TAKE YOUR TIME?

14:46.086 --> 14:48.621
YEAH. YOU GET FOOD
YOU CAN ACTUALLY EAT.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.533
AND WHAT IS OUR
EPICUREAN KING

15:00.600 --> 15:01.868

15:01.935 --> 15:04.437

15:04.504 --> 15:05.505
OOH!

15:05.572 --> 15:07.140
A LA WALDO.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.708
OH, MAGNIFIQUE!

15:08.775 --> 15:12.512
THANKS AGAIN FOR CATERING
MY DINNER PARTY LAST WEEKEND.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.083
THEY LIKED THE POACHED
SALMON BEURRE BLANC?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.150
THEY LOVED IT.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.519
AND THE CReME BRuLeE?

15:19.586 --> 15:20.553
THEY RAVED.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.089
YOU KNOW, WALDO,

15:22.155 --> 15:23.623
IF YOU APPLY YOURSELF,

15:23.690 --> 15:26.526
YOU HAVE THE TALENT
TO BECOME A REALLY
GREAT CHEF.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.860
WOW.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.863
I'VE NEVER BEEN GOOD
AT ANYTHING BEFORE.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.633
WELL, I CAN PLAY
THE TOP 40
ON MY ARMPIT,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.538
BUT YOU KNOW
HOW FICKLE

15:38.605 --> 15:40.007
THE MUSIC BUSINESS
IS.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.010
MISS STEUBEN!

15:44.411 --> 15:46.446
IT'S ALIVE!

15:46.513 --> 15:47.981
WHAT?

15:48.048 --> 15:49.449
IT'S MY URK YEAST!

15:49.516 --> 15:51.484
IT APPEARS THE FUNGI
HAS MUTATED.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.754
ITS MASS IS TRIPLING
EVERY FEW SECONDS!

15:54.821 --> 15:56.656
LET'S PRAY IT'S NOT
INTELLIGENT.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.957
WHAT SHALL
WE DO?

15:58.025 --> 15:59.326
STAND BACK!

15:59.392 --> 16:01.128
OH, GOD!

16:01.194 --> 16:03.530
OH, OW, OW, OW, OW.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.665
OW, OW, OW, OW.

OH!

16:06.766 --> 16:08.568
OW! OW!

16:08.635 --> 16:10.037

OHH!

16:14.474 --> 16:16.243
STOP IT! STOP IT!

16:16.309 --> 16:18.378
AAH!

16:21.014 --> 16:22.715
SAVE YOURSELVES!

16:22.782 --> 16:24.651
SAVE YOURSELF,
LAURA!

16:24.717 --> 16:26.853
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

16:26.919 --> 16:29.656
GET A CONTAINER!
CATCH THE STUFF!

16:29.722 --> 16:32.425
OH. COOL.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.309
CASSIE LYNN,
LET'S HELP THEM!

16:49.376 --> 16:53.046
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
I'M WEARING SILK.

16:53.113 --> 16:56.716
I HOPE YOU KNOW
A GOOD DRY CLEANER!

16:56.783 --> 16:58.451
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!

16:59.886 --> 17:01.521
BE CAREFUL!

17:01.588 --> 17:03.456
OH, ICK!

17:10.330 --> 17:12.599
CARL, GOT A MINUTE?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.934
I'M ON MY WAY
TO WORK.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.670
RICHIE HAS SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.705
GO AHEAD, SWEETIE.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.141
I'M A ROTTEN
SLIMEBALL.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.611
COME HERE, RICHIE.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.146
GO TO UNCLE CARL.

17:26.213 --> 17:31.050
NOW, JUST CALM DOWN
AND TELL YOUR UNCLE CARL

17:31.118 --> 17:33.052
WHY YOU'RE
A ROTTEN SLIMEBALL.

17:33.120 --> 17:36.055
I BROKE YOUR NEW
TV CAMERA.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.625
OH...

17:38.691 --> 17:39.992
IT WAS YOU.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.494
HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

17:41.561 --> 17:42.795
I DROPPED IT.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.732
RICHIE SAYS HE HASN'T SLEPT
SINCE IT HAPPENED.

17:45.798 --> 17:50.970
I TOLD HIM HE'D FEEL BETTER
IF HE TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.439
YOUR MOMMY IS RIGHT.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.742
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
LISTEN TO YOUR
CONSCIENCE.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.210
MY CONSCIENCE?

17:57.277 --> 18:00.147
MM-HMM.
THAT LITTLE VOICE
THAT TELLS YOU

18:00.213 --> 18:02.449
THAT YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.984
MOMMY, YOU'RE LIKE
A CONSCIENCE, TOO.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.219
THAT'S RIGHT, HONEY.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.222
ONLY YOU'RE
A LOT LOUDER.

18:09.289 --> 18:12.125
THAT'S RIGHT,
HONEY.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.493
DON'T YOU
FEEL BETTER

18:13.560 --> 18:15.995
HAVING TOLD
UNCLE CARL
THE TRUTH?

18:16.062 --> 18:17.164
SURE DO.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.599
KNOW WHAT?
I FEEL BETTER, TOO,

18:19.666 --> 18:23.303
BECAUSE I ALREADY
KNEW THAT YOU
BROKE MY CAMERA.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.105
I WAITED TO SEE
IF YOU'D TELL ME.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.507
REALLY?
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

18:27.574 --> 18:31.678
WELL, LET'S TAKE
A LOOK AT THE TAPE.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.347
NOW, YOU SEE?

18:34.414 --> 18:36.883
IT IS OBVIOUS
THAT THE CAMERAMAN

18:36.949 --> 18:38.785
WAS 3 FEET TALL.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.554
OOPS.

18:41.621 --> 18:45.558
WE HAVE TO TALK TO EDDIE
ABOUT HIS STUDY HABITS.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.636
[BUBBLING NOISES]

19:06.513 --> 19:08.981
MISS STEUBEN,
I TOLD THE JANITOR

19:09.048 --> 19:12.252
ABOUT OUR
LITTLE PROBLEM HERE.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.153
IS HE COMING?

19:14.221 --> 19:18.391
NO. HE OPTED FOR
EARLY RETIREMENT.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.727
I SEE.

19:20.793 --> 19:25.232
OH, I THINK HE HAD
THE RIGHT IDEA, STEVEN.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.067
I THINK I'M GOING
TO MARCH MYSELF

19:28.134 --> 19:30.370
RIGHT DOWN TO
THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

19:30.437 --> 19:32.705
AND TURN IN
MY SPATULA.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.211
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
MISS STEUBEN?

19:38.278 --> 19:40.146
I'M QUITTING!

19:40.213 --> 19:41.448
I'M FACING THE FACT

19:41.514 --> 19:44.150
THAT AS A TEACHER
I DESERVE AN "F."

19:44.217 --> 19:46.386
BITE YOUR TONGUE,
MISS STEUBEN.

19:46.453 --> 19:50.156
I ALREADY DID THAT
WHEN I SLIPPED.

19:50.223 --> 19:52.158
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL
TEACHER.

19:52.225 --> 19:56.128
NO! I'M A NERVOUS
TEACHER!

19:56.195 --> 19:58.231
OH I HAVE A MUSCLE
IN MY FOREHEAD

19:58.298 --> 20:00.400
THAT WILL NOT
STOP JERKING.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.170
MISS STEUBEN,
LISTEN.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.539
YOU TAUGHT LAURA
TO SLOW DOWN

20:06.606 --> 20:08.675
AND STOP TAKING
SHORTCUTS,

20:08.741 --> 20:11.544
AND YOU TAUGHT
CASSIE LYNN NUBBLES,

USELESS PEOPLE...

THINGS FOR HERSELF.

AND, MY GOD!

20:21.988 --> 20:24.457
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE
DONE TO WALDO.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.594
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW YOU'VE
CHANGED HIM?

20:27.660 --> 20:30.196
I GUESS HE'S CHANGED
A LITTLE.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.931
A LITTLE? WHY--WHOA!

20:31.998 --> 20:33.132
WHOA.

20:33.199 --> 20:34.701
WHY, THANKS TO YOU,

20:34.767 --> 20:39.639
WALDO
IS SWAPPING RECIPES
WITH WOLFGANG PUCK.

20:39.706 --> 20:42.675
YOU HELPED HIM DISCOVER
A HIDDEN TALENT.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.578
AND NOW, THANKS TO YOU,
HE HAS SOMETHING

20:45.645 --> 20:47.380
THAT HE DIDN'T
HAVE BEFORE--

20:47.447 --> 20:49.916
SELF-RESPECT.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.951
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
STEVEN?

20:52.018 --> 20:56.088
HAVE I TAUGHT YOU
ANYTHING?

20:56.155 --> 20:57.890
WELL...

20:57.957 --> 20:59.692
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.829
WHAT GRADE AM I
GOING TO GET?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.364

LOOK AROUND, STEVEN.

21:06.165 --> 21:08.668
[BUBBLING NOISES]

21:08.735 --> 21:13.172
I DON'T THINK AN "A"
IS IN THE CARDS.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.741
I DIDN'T THINK SO,

21:14.807 --> 21:17.544
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'VE TAUGHT ME,
MISS STEUBEN--

21:17.610 --> 21:20.547
IT'S OKAY TO BE
LESS THAN PERFECT

21:20.613 --> 21:23.249
AS LONG AS YOU
TRIED YOUR BEST.

21:23.316 --> 21:26.553
WELL, ACTUALLY, I GUESS
THAT APPLIES TO ME.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.556
LOOK, MISS STEUBEN,
YOU TEACH US MORE

21:29.622 --> 21:32.559
THAN JUST THINGS
OUT OF A TEXTBOOK.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.194
YOU TEACH US THINGS
ABOUT LIFE!

21:35.261 --> 21:36.996
DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?

21:37.063 --> 21:40.867
I KNOW THE PAY'S LOUSY,
THE HOURS ARE LONG,

21:40.933 --> 21:43.670
AND YOU RARELY GET
THE CREDIT YOU DESERVE,

21:43.736 --> 21:46.373
BUT YOU'RE A TEACHER,
MISS STEUBEN...

21:46.439 --> 21:48.641
AND A DARN GOOD ONE.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.178
OH, STEVEN!
