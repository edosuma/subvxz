She does have an amazing touch.

Well, it's only been worn once,

and it looks much better on you

04:10.250 --> 04:11.410
In human tradition,

04:11.585 --> 04:13.871
I understand the mother of the bride

04:14.046 --> 04:16.788
gives her daughter something borrowed
to wear during the ceremony.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.625
As your mother's not with us,

04:20.802 --> 04:24.420
I thought I would give you
something I were at my wedding.

When we boarded the Ark,
we were only allowed to bring three items.

How do I wear it?

04:37.527 --> 04:39.609
I'll show you.

04:40.322 --> 04:43.906
My mother wore it
and her mother before that.

04:44.076 --> 04:50.788
You know, the human phrase
'daughter-in-Iaw' is so cold, so distant.

04:51.875 --> 04:56.209
Our word, 'hanya tavo,‘
means 'heart daughter.‘

04:56.713 --> 05:00.626

05:05.722 --> 05:08.213
You're not supposed to.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.600
In Castithan tradition, the bride is blind

05:13.188 --> 05:17.557
until her betrothed opens her eyes
at the end of the ceremony.

05:18.610 --> 05:23.479
I'll never forget the moment
my hand-maidens lifted my telo.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.233

05:32.040 --> 05:36.374

I found one drop of blood, that's it.

If it was murder, why isn't there more blood?

09:10.675 --> 09:13.257
Somebody cleaned the ﬂoor.

-They missed a drop.
-Yeah.

Look, Hunter was a... He owed money.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.894
He got into a ﬁght and lost a little blood,
and he hightailed it out of Deﬁance.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.975
No, look.

09:26.149 --> 09:30.438
Okay, I've never owned a home,
never owned a business.

from their accomplishments.

-Yeah. Not a man like Hunter.

12:07.685 --> 12:08.765

let anybody into your life.

12:37.882 --> 12:41.249
-And I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.
-I think I'm old enough to look after myself.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.044
No, you can't, Kenya.

12:44.222 --> 12:45.302
And if it comes to it,

12:45.473 --> 12:50.513
I will do whatever it takes to make sure
he never lays a hand on you again.

ask Mayor Rosewater some questions.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.693
Yes, of course.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.864
I'm really sorry about Mr Bell.

(BREATHES DEEPLY)

13:23.720 --> 13:27.212
-Hunter Bell was your brother-in-Iaw, right?
-Yes.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.382
You would have known him pretty well.
What was he like?

13:32.896 --> 13:34.978
Charming, rich, handsome.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.018
Maybe a little bit dangerous?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.058
(EXHALES)

13:42.363 --> 13:43.523
He was a bully.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.234
Did he, uh...

13:50.246 --> 13:51.907
Did he bully your sister?

13:54.709 --> 13:55.698
No.

13:59.380 --> 14:03.965
He loved her. She loved him.
She was devastated when he disappeared.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.926
-They're lying. Both of them.
-Maybe.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.476
You know,
I think that Hunter was beating on Kenya,

14:12.644 --> 14:14.555
and Amanda could've killed him
to protect her sister.

14:14.729 --> 14:18.096
Or Kenya killed him
and Amanda's lying to protect her.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.980
So what're you gonna do about it?

14:20.151 --> 14:23.643
I'm gonna go home, put on
some fresh clothes and go to a wedding.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.105
Nolan, a man was killed.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.403
A bad man. A long time ago.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.943
You're gonna try to bury this, aren't you?

14:32.163 --> 14:34.279
It's my job to keep the peace,

14:34.457 --> 14:38.791
not run around like Sherlock Holmes
chasing old ghosts.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.123
And what about justice?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.707
Make sure you wear a tie tonight.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.971
My daughter is not wearing this hockey mask
at her wedding.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.008
This is an heirloom. Show some respect.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.553
She'll be able to see
when she's walking down the aisle

14:57.730 --> 14:59.311
and folks will be able to see her.

14:59.482 --> 15:03.270
A Castithan wedding isn't a wedding
if the bride doesn't wear her telo.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.065
I'm the one footing the bill for this thing.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.195
Christie wears what I say she wears.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.948
You humans believe you're so superior.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.160
The truth is, you're primitives.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.912
Your minds are dull. Your hands are clumsy.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.034
-(SCOFFS)
-The scent of your pink skin sickens me.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.714
Does this skin look pink to you?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.998
Oh, you all look the same.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.251
Let me ask you something.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.046
You hate humans so much.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.055
Why are letting your boy marry one?

15:36.686 --> 15:38.222
Alak wishes it.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.098
No.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.932
You've been good with this the whole time.

15:44.110 --> 15:48.945
So, I gotta ask myself, what's your angle?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.325
What do you get out of this wedding?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.571
I believe in love.

15:56.873 --> 15:59.364
You know, I was thinking
about how the McCawley Mines

15:59.542 --> 16:01.999
were built on land
stolen from lrathient settlers.

16:03.212 --> 16:08.172
Now, that's a tainted legacy
that I do not want to leave to our kids.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.083
So when I die,

16:10.261 --> 16:16.222
my mines go to a trust beneﬁting
the lrathient population of Deﬁance.

16:17.685 --> 16:21.223
You do think I'm doing the right thing,
don't you, Datak?

16:22.315 --> 16:26.228
Oh, they're your mines, Rafe.
I don't care what you do with them.

16:26.986 --> 16:27.975
Good.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.905
Breakfast is on me.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.407
(DATAK SHOUTING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE)

16:36.746 --> 16:38.031
The wedding is offl

16:39.499 --> 16:43.868
Datak, I understand you're upset, but if
Christie does not want to wear the telo...

16:44.212 --> 16:46.453
It's not about the gwoking telol

16:47.340 --> 16:49.831
Rafe McCawley
has written Christie out of his will.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.501
The mines are going to the l-rathsl

16:56.015 --> 16:59.303
Rafe may say that now, but be patient.

16:59.477 --> 17:02.014
Once his ﬁrst grandchild arrives,
he'll reconsider.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.348
I will not wait.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.062
Instead, I will win this election.

17:05.775 --> 17:10.394
Then, when I'm mayor, I will ﬁnd a way to
take the mines away from Rafe McCawleyI

17:10.571 --> 17:12.186
How does Alak feel about this?

17:12.824 --> 17:15.782
Alak's a child. He'll get over it.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.823
My parents would not have wanted me
to marry you.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.409
And yet, here we are.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.575
Alak is more pliable
than either of us at his age.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.620
We were immigrants.
We were strong because we had to be.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.414
Alak will never have to endure
the same hardships we did,

17:31.592 --> 17:33.048
and I thank RA-yet-so for that.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.509
Don't you want him to be happy?

17:43.855 --> 17:46.346
Our son loves this human girl.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.148
She makes him smile.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.853
She lifts his spirits in a way
that nobody else can.

17:55.575 --> 17:59.944
A Castithan woman
can lift his spirits just ﬁne.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.197
Alak is of this new world.

18:04.375 --> 18:07.833
He doesn't see the humans the way we do.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.203
He sees beauty in them.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.375
Kindness.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.087
Then he's lost the sense of smell.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.503
Maybe you have, too.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.016
I'm calling the priest.

18:28.065 --> 18:32.058
Perhaps Alak should be the ﬁrst
to hear of your decision.

18:41.996 --> 18:44.988
You know,
Nolan should really be here right now.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.373
It's a waste of time.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.127
Yeah.
Looking for evidence is a big waste of time.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.209
-You want evidence?
-You know, if I ran things,

18:54.383 --> 18:58.626
I'd have ﬁve deputies
combing over every inch of this place.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.504
You don't need ﬁve deputies.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.930
Whisker. Liberata.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.824
Jered.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.824
Jered, the bartender,
was working here when Hunter owned it.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.573
Jered. il's Tommy. You around?

19:30.586 --> 19:32.087
Jered?

19:36.175 --> 19:38.587
-lt's locked.
-So?

19:38.761 --> 19:41.924
So we've gotta go back to Nolan and get
a warrant or something. We can't just...

19:44.934 --> 19:45.969
Can't just what?

20:09.041 --> 20:10.030
NOLAN: Poor Jered.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.246
His throat's been slit earlobe to earlobe.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.753
Just like Elah Bandik.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.335
Someone didn't want him to talk.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.133
-Why are his ﬁngers like that?
-I don't know. Maybe nitrogen deprivation.

20:28.144 --> 20:31.227
This has all the markings of a Casti hit.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.810
When I was about your age,

20:35.985 --> 20:39.318
the Arks were going through
their ﬁnal preparations.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.272
I had just won passage playing i-VA-li.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.568
But my father refused to leave home.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.038
I... I don't understand.
Why would he stay on a dying planet?

20:52.168 --> 20:56.002
He said if the suns were to
swallow up our world,

20:56.172 --> 20:59.585
he needed to be
inside the walls of the holy temple.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.252
He could not
leave the Castithan scrolls unattended.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.880
Not even in the face of death.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.142
Do you know why?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.347
No.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.513
Because he had made that promise
to his own father.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.683
Um...

21:19.987 --> 21:23.730
Fine. Yeah...
No, I'll talk to Christie about the telo.

21:27.161 --> 21:30.619
When I gave you permission
to marry outside of our race,

21:30.790 --> 21:34.078
I knew it was a dishonour
to my father's memory.

21:35.211 --> 21:38.453
But I let you and your mother sway me.

21:39.006 --> 21:39.995
I was wrong.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.550
But, Dad... No. I...

21:44.720 --> 21:50.716
I regret allowing it to have come this far,
but you are my only son, Alak,

21:51.602 --> 21:54.264
and our Castithan blood will not be diluted.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.437
Do you understand?

21:57.608 --> 22:02.398
No, no, no. I don't understand, okay?
I love her.

22:03.239 --> 22:04.194
This is bullshtak.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.071
Watch yourself.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.403
Without the name Tarr, you're nothing.

22:08.577 --> 22:12.490
Nothing but a street haint
with dyed hair and a record collection.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.247
'Street haint'?

22:15.418 --> 22:17.079
Isn't that how you see yourself?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.163
You're always talking about

22:18.337 --> 22:20.669
how you pulled yourself out of the mud
and made the humans respect you?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.000
I said to watch your tongue.

22:22.174 --> 22:26.087
I don't give a kanga rat's ass
about the sacred scrolls.

22:26.262 --> 22:29.004
All right, maybe your father chose to die
guarding a bunch of stupid papers,

22:29.181 --> 22:34.221
but I wasn't born on Casti.
I was born on Earth, just like Christie.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.475
And we're getting married.

22:35.980 --> 22:39.893
I didn't expect you to be happy about this,
but you will obey my wishes.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.355
Or what? You're gonna slit my throat?
That's the Casti way.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.856
I'll give you time to cool off.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.501
-Datak.
-Not now, Lawkeeper.

23:08.679 --> 23:10.340
-It can't wait.
-It will wait.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.301
-Datak Tarr, you're under arrest.
-On what charges?

23:15.102 --> 23:16.091
(GRUNTS)

23:16.812 --> 23:19.975
For the murder of
Jered Kikema and Hunter Bell.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.482
She's in there.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.240
Heyl

23:35.414 --> 23:37.075
Hey.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.165
I'm so excited.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.911
I even decided to wear the telo.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.622
I know I said I didn't want to.
But then I was thinking...

23:48.302 --> 23:50.213
My wedding,

23:50.387 --> 23:54.676
my dream of what I wanted it to be like
when I was a little kid.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.386
That's never going to happen,

23:56.894 --> 24:00.011
because my mom won't be there,
my brothers won't be there.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.929
All that matters is that you're there.

24:02.983 --> 24:06.441
And if it makes your parents happy for me
to wear a metal mask over my face,

24:06.612 --> 24:08.193
-then so be it.
-Christie.

24:11.117 --> 24:14.325
There's something I need to tell you.

24:21.377 --> 24:22.366
RAFE: Christie.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.845
What did you do?

24:35.516 --> 24:36.631
What did you say to her?

24:38.561 --> 24:42.270
It's my father. He...
He's trying to stop the wedding.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.065
I don't know what to do.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.397
I can't live without her.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.820
You really love her, don't you?

24:52.366 --> 24:53.822
Yes, sir.

24:58.414 --> 25:01.906
Well, then that's all that matters.

25:04.587 --> 25:08.580
Why in the three hells would I kill
a knee-high Liberata bartender?

25:08.757 --> 25:10.964
Maybe because he knew
you killed Hunter Bell.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.174
Or maybe because
he helped you hide the corpse.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.721
I have no idea what you're talking about.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.595
-You don't recognise this?
-No.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.632
Really? 'Cause we found that in your closet.

25:19.810 --> 25:25.100
And that handle, that matches the caved-in
part of Bell's skull like a key ﬁts a lock.

25:25.274 --> 25:26.764
Well, I've never seen it before in my life.

25:27.109 --> 25:29.691
Tommy tells me that you and Bell
were in business together.

25:30.613 --> 25:34.276
Yeah, you might say that...

25:35.784 --> 25:37.399
You're asking for a raise?

25:37.828 --> 25:40.535
I'm asking for a stake. I built this tent.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.364
I quadrupled proﬁts every month.
I deserve it.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.117
Well, look who's all grown up.

25:47.504 --> 25:50.337
When I ﬁrst came to town,
you were running brawls in dark alleys,

25:50.507 --> 25:53.044
jacking rollers on Urdu Street.

25:53.344 --> 25:56.051
My money made you, Tarr.
Don't ever forget that.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.641
With all due respect,

26:00.476 --> 26:03.183
I suggest you reconsider.

26:04.605 --> 26:08.018
You know, in some cultures,

26:08.192 --> 26:12.310
when a man challenges the chief,
there's a ﬁght

26:13.656 --> 26:16.568
until only one of them is left standing.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.484
You want power?

26:19.662 --> 26:22.654
Power isn't seen. It's felt.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.659
How does that feel?

26:32.633 --> 26:34.169
HUNTER: Get upl

26:35.094 --> 26:36.083
All right, come onl

26:48.524 --> 26:49.855
What's wrong, can't win a fair ﬁght?

26:50.025 --> 26:51.765
I win. That's all that matters.

26:53.696 --> 26:54.685
(GUN COCKS)

26:54.989 --> 26:57.731
Drop the blade or I drop you.

27:15.676 --> 27:16.631
Thank you.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.542
You're welcome.

27:22.474 --> 27:26.513
I believe your life expectancy
has taken a turn for the worse.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.310
Why did you do it?

27:28.480 --> 27:31.722
Well, call me old-fashioned,
but I believe in a fair ﬁght.

27:31.900 --> 27:35.734
Yes, you are old-fashioned, right down to
your choice of antique weapons.

27:35.904 --> 27:40.443
I like to hit what I'm aiming at,
and my aim isn't always too good.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.357
I'll try to remember that.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.235
That clown is making a move on my mines.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.785
I imagine you've no intention
of allowing that to happen.

27:48.959 --> 27:52.417
See, normally, I wouldn't think
you and I have much in common.

27:52.588 --> 27:56.501
But when it comes to our friend Hunter Bell,
I think we do.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.346
Let me buy you a drink.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.050
I wish I had the pleasure of hearing
Hunter Bell's last breath,

28:04.224 --> 28:06.089
but I'm afraid someone else beat me to it.

28:06.643 --> 28:12.058
Whoever it is, they're trying to frame me.
They planted that walking stick in my closet.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.847
Any idea who?

28:14.026 --> 28:18.520
I pay my taxes so people like you
can ﬁgure things like that out.

28:20.449 --> 28:21.438
(GRUNTS)

28:24.620 --> 28:27.657
Get outta herel Go on.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.245
What was that?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.870
Theatre.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.289
Datak Tarr is an egomaniac.

28:38.467 --> 28:42.460
If he had killed Hunter Bell,
that body wouldn't be holed up in a wall.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.128
It'd be on display in the town square.

28:44.973 --> 28:46.838
So, then why did we bring him in here?

28:48.018 --> 28:49.098
Now he's good and riled up,

28:49.269 --> 28:52.306
maybe he'll lead us to the person
who framed him, the real killer.

28:54.817 --> 28:58.651
You knew this this whole time.
Why didn't you tell me?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.979
I thought you'd be more convincing this way.

29:04.868 --> 29:07.905
Where I come from,
framing a man is the act of a coward.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.991
Tarr, I don't know what you're talking about.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.623
Hunter Bell.
You had as much reason to kill him as I did.

29:13.794 --> 29:17.503
Why not just have the JON-du-ra to admit it
instead of implicating me?

29:17.673 --> 29:19.880
You really think I killed that sack of shtako?

29:20.342 --> 29:22.003
Well, if you didn't do it, who did?

29:22.719 --> 29:26.007
Don't know, don't care.
I have a wedding to attend.

29:26.723 --> 29:27.712
(CHUCKLES)

29:28.183 --> 29:29.764
Well, the wedding is off.

29:31.353 --> 29:34.220
That's what Alak said at ﬁrst.

29:34.398 --> 29:35.854
Then we started talking.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.936
Your son loves my daughter,
and my daughter loves him,

29:39.111 --> 29:40.692
and that's good enough for me.

29:40.863 --> 29:43.730
Oh, he may never get my mines,
but I will look out for him,

29:44.408 --> 29:48.321
and I will make sure that those kids have
a wedding that they will always remember.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.867
Oh, please.

29:53.876 --> 29:54.865
Um...

29:55.252 --> 29:58.744
We should get over there.
The ceremony's about to begin.

Dr Yevvll? I got your message.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.682
I'm just on my way to the wedding.

30:15.898 --> 30:18.059
I won't keep you long.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.067
Would you mind locking the door?

30:25.407 --> 30:27.443
Have you come to a decision?

30:28.118 --> 30:29.278
Are we partners again?

30:29.995 --> 30:32.452
We'll get so much farther working together.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.659
This isn't about the artefact.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.877
Our favourite Liberate bartender
was killed today.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.703
Oh, no. How sad.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.089
A Casti charge blade slit his throat.

30:44.468 --> 30:48.302
Oh, Datak Tarr.
(CHUCKLES) Why am I not surprised?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.343
Nicolette.

30:56.146 --> 30:58.057
It's me you're talking to.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.151
I had no choice.

31:04.947 --> 31:09.611
He was the only person
who knew that we killed Hunter Bell.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.284
DOC: There was no reason to hurt him.

31:17.459 --> 31:20.701
Jered's known the truth for seven years
and he never said a word.

31:21.255 --> 31:24.042
It was pre-emptive.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.127
I was exposed once, Doctor.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.048
I couldn't risk that happening again.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.800
DOC: Well, vision seems
to be functioning okay.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.468
Well, I told you, I'm ﬁne.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.929
It's just this damn ache in my arm and leg.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.475
Okay. Well, let's take a look at it.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.941
Okay, wiggle your ﬁngers.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.495
How did you get in here?

32:02.462 --> 32:04.453
Kenya slipped. I needed some salve.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.007
Well, get out.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.465
This is a sterile environment.

I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding.

32:33.619 --> 32:37.111
Yes. There certainly has.

-Well, let's start with the truth,

-(LAUGHS)

32:56.808 --> 33:00.221
There is something very important
in this town, Mr Bell.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.603
In the wrong hands,
it could be very dangerous.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.399
We're here to prevent that happening.

We're here to protect Earth.

Well, I don't want to get in the way
of your important job,

Quite the negotiator to boot.

33:36.390 --> 33:37.926
This isn't a negotiation.

helping us clean up this mess?

Relax, Doctor.

You know, when I ﬁrst came to this town,
I wanted to start over.

34:26.815 --> 34:30.057
I wanted to right my wrongs. And you...

34:30.235 --> 34:34.228
Well, you told me
everything that I wanted to hear.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.987
You were my inspiration.

34:44.541 --> 34:46.497
But you changed.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.334
You unleashed the Volge, Nicky.

34:49.629 --> 34:52.371
You murdered a harmless bartender.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.332
It has become painfully clear to me

34:55.510 --> 34:59.094
that there is no end to the lives
that you're willing to sacriﬁce

how am I supposed to trust you
with a genocidal weapon?

The ﬁrst needle was a paralytic.

35:14.863 --> 35:18.697
It'll stop you from struggling,
and also from experiencing pain.

35:22.329 --> 35:24.741
You know, I've changed, too.

35:25.499 --> 35:28.707
I've become a healer instead of a destroyer.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.790
And that's why I'm so sorry
for what I have to do.

You look beautiful.

36:07.082 --> 36:08.743
I didn't think I'd be this nervous.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.249
You have nothing to be nervous about

36:11.419 --> 36:16.755
as long as you remember that your husband
is your partner and your equal.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.632
And you are never gonna let him
treat you as anything less.

when the E.M.C. used oxygen bombs,

I killed Hunter Bell for what I thought
was the betterment of this town.

When his body was recently discovered,

40:48.905 --> 40:54.195
I killed Jered Kikema

before the lawkeeper discovers the truth.

I was acting for the greater good,
