- Rubbish.

to you in California.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.111

Not guilty, Your Honor.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.745

09:04.778 --> 09:06.980
We're in a holding pattern.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.856
But the expectation is

09:15.889 --> 09:18.025
we're the fire line

09:30.103 --> 09:32.072

Well, it's all in

but, uh, several of
the burglars have been

10:14.948 --> 10:17.651
attached to agency operations
over the years--

10:17.684 --> 10:19.086
especially Hunt and McCord.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.887
<i>And Hunt--get this.</i>

10:20.921 --> 10:22.622
He had an office
in the White House

10:22.656 --> 10:24.391
- with a safe in it.
- <i>Wha--</i>

10:24.624 --> 10:27.728
You're kidding me. All right,
we-we have to look into that.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.329

10:29.363 --> 10:31.064
<i>He's the guy

10:34.968 --> 10:36.370
<i>Just performing

10:36.403 --> 10:39.106
- as associate director, sir.
- Ugh, just behold the spirit.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.908

10:41.942 --> 10:42.909
<i>That's actually--</i>

10:42.943 --> 10:45.178

10:46.279 --> 10:47.414

10:47.647 --> 10:48.915
In-in the story.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.851
<i>Marley was Ebenezer Scrooge's
partner--</i>

10:50.884 --> 10:52.786
Well, Hunt's office
at the White House

10:52.819 --> 10:55.856
may indicate that there
are higher-ups involved,

10:55.889 --> 10:59.192
but can you...
corroborate any of this?

10:59.226 --> 11:02.229
Not yet. We would need to
interview John Dean

11:02.262 --> 11:04.831
<i>and the leadership at CREEP.</i>

11:04.865 --> 11:06.900
That means Mitchell, uh,
McGruder, uh, the--

11:06.933 --> 11:08.735
<i>Kay, I'm gonna
stop you right there.</i>

11:08.769 --> 11:10.771
This is not the Gestapo.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.440
We can't go swinging
at the former attorney general

11:13.673 --> 11:17.210
<i>or the- the White House counsel
like a piñata, okay?</i>

11:17.244 --> 11:19.146
So no Dean, no Mitchell,

11:19.179 --> 11:21.448
no McGruder thereof.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.183
Well, sir, that's why
we thought we'd start

11:23.216 --> 11:25.352
by interviewing the lower level
employees first--

11:25.385 --> 11:27.187
anyone
not in a leadership role.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.423
Copy boys, secretaries,

11:29.456 --> 11:30.891
<i>accountants.</i>

11:32.692 --> 11:34.361
Do you have a problem

11:34.394 --> 11:37.431
No... Mark, I don't have
a problem with that.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.336
This is a giant
frickin' problem.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.938
<i>I don't know what

11:44.971 --> 11:46.907
<i>I mean, we're screwed.
We are so screwed!</i>

11:46.940 --> 11:48.775
What the fuck, Pat? You--

11:48.809 --> 11:51.344
I specifically told you to keep
your agents away from CREEP.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.280
<i>It's not my fault.</i>

11:53.313 --> 11:55.348
They were relentless--
I had to give them something

11:55.382 --> 11:57.818
<i>or it would have looked
suspicious in front of Felt.</i>

11:57.851 --> 11:59.419
Fuck!

11:59.453 --> 12:00.754
So they're comin'
today.

12:00.787 --> 12:01.755
Wh-which agents?

12:01.788 --> 12:03.190
Lano and the other one.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.858
It's only a matter of time

12:04.891 --> 12:06.159
before they figure out
what's going on.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.928
I-I can't call them off.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.162
They're your agents, Pat.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.730
You're the director
of the fucking FBI!

12:10.764 --> 12:12.866
I-I don't appreciate
that language.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.435
Look... I gotta go, okay?
I'll deal with it.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.804
- I don't like that langua--
- <i>I said</i>

12:17.838 --> 12:19.272
I will deal with it.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.743
Well, that didn't sound handled.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.145
So...

12:25.178 --> 12:27.848
...two of Pat Gray's agents
are coming by today

12:27.881 --> 12:29.282
to conduct interviews at CREEP.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.218
- What?
- Yeah. He said he can't

12:31.251 --> 12:33.086
credibly call 'em off
without raising suspicion.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.488
The guy's fucking useless.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.257
Well, of course he is.
He's one of our appointees.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.226
Well, I'll-I'll sic
Moore on it.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.195
Whoa, whoa. Dickie Moore,
the little leg-fucker

12:42.229 --> 12:44.331
that follows you around
like a sentient herpe?

12:44.364 --> 12:46.233
No, absolutely not.
You're handling this.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.768
No, th-the president
wants me to sit next to him

12:48.802 --> 12:51.438
on the flight to Miami.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.774
The president would want you
to see this through.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.409
<i>Trust me.</i>

12:56.443 --> 12:59.045
<i>And try to
wrap things up quick.</i>

12:59.079 --> 13:00.914
One of our big donors,
Ken Dahlberg,

13:00.947 --> 13:02.449
is throwing a convention party
tomorrow night

13:02.482 --> 13:04.217
at the Shore Club,
and he wants you there.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.354
Me? For--f-for what?

13:07.387 --> 13:10.090
He's one of the guys that
funded Operation Gemstone.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.858
<i>So you play your cards right,</i>

13:11.892 --> 13:14.494
he'll finance your
presidential run one day.

13:14.528 --> 13:16.263
Don't worry.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.531
We'll save you a seat
on Air Force One

13:17.564 --> 13:18.865
for the return flight.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.540
Look at this.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.809
A right triangle
between the participants.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.311
That's gonna unbalance
the subject

13:31.344 --> 13:32.879
and give us candid responses.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.849
I'd go equilateral. It--

13:35.882 --> 13:37.250
like this here.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.187
It sets the subject at ease.
It opens 'em up.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.988
Nice and easy.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.892
One adjustment.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.098
Equilateral in appearance...

13:52.132 --> 13:53.600
scalene in reality.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.135
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

13:56.269 --> 13:58.371
I don't believe
we've officially met.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.308
You must be Agent Lano
and young Agent Magallanes.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.909
So you mind if I
pull up a chair?

14:02.943 --> 14:06.346
Mr. Dean, we didn't know
you'd be joining us today.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.849
Ah, well, I'll be representing
all of the employees

14:09.883 --> 14:12.085
for the Committee
to Re-elect the President.

14:12.118 --> 14:13.587
- As of when?
- Today.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.121
Just now. A second ago.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.526
All right. Fine.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.897
Miss Abrontes.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.865
Thanks for coming in today.
How are you doing?

14:25.899 --> 14:27.167
Uh, let me stop you
right there.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.969
Miss Abrontes
has agreed to this interview

14:29.002 --> 14:31.438
on the condition that it be
fast, fair, and focused.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.907
If we could keep the questions
to a professional nature,

14:33.940 --> 14:35.575
that'd be fantastic.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.277
Very well.

14:40.614 --> 14:43.383
Miss Abrontes,

14:43.416 --> 14:46.052
wh--what would you say

14:46.086 --> 14:48.588
the organizational
mentality is like here

14:48.622 --> 14:50.190
<i>at the Committee to Re-elect?</i>

14:50.223 --> 14:52.492
Miss Abrontes doesn't feel
comfortable answering questions

14:52.525 --> 14:54.594
dealing with the general
hierarchical makeup

14:54.628 --> 14:56.129
of the Committee to Re-elect.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.565
If we can keep the questions to
specific empirical fact,

14:58.598 --> 15:00.300
I'd appreciate that greatly.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.439
What kinda work did you do for
the campaign in the past,

15:06.473 --> 15:07.574
Mrs. Frankel?

15:07.607 --> 15:09.976
I'm sorry, have we stipulated

15:10.010 --> 15:13.313
what range of dates
is meant by "the past"?

15:13.346 --> 15:15.482
So for the entire time
that you've worked

15:15.515 --> 15:18.018
for the Committee for the
Re-election of the President--

15:18.051 --> 15:19.919
He hasn't.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.055
- He--what?
- He hasn't ever worked

15:22.088 --> 15:25.091
at the Committee <i>for</i> the
Re-election of the President.

15:25.125 --> 15:29.195
He's worked at the Committee
<i>to</i> Re-elect the President.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.066
Next.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.635
Thank you.

15:35.669 --> 15:37.570
"Don't answer that."
So don't answer anything?

15:40.106 --> 15:42.275
Go. Go.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.248
<i>Is he doodling?</i>

15:48.281 --> 15:49.616
This guy's doodling.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.451
Sir...

15:51.484 --> 15:53.253
A-are we done?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.522
'Cause I gotta use the head
somethin' awful.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.490
Can I use the head?

15:57.524 --> 16:00.260
What are you asking him for?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.163
He's not conducting
the interview--we are.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.734
Yeah, go.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.038
Ohh.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.542
Mr. Gonzalez,
have you seen anyone unusual

16:15.575 --> 16:18.611
working in the office
in the past few weeks?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.549
No.

16:22.582 --> 16:26.052
Have you seen any suspicious
documents being shredded?

16:26.086 --> 16:28.455
Money perhaps?
Sequential bills?

16:30.190 --> 16:31.291
No.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.592
Señor Gonzalez...

16:32.625 --> 16:37.130
Do you sleep
hanging by the feet like a bat,

16:37.163 --> 16:40.266
or continuously swimming like a shark?

16:44.471 --> 16:46.373
Yeah, okay.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.441
You can go.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.277
Fuck me.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.413
Tony, Daniel, Ronald, Ruth,
Dan, Roni, Bill,

16:53.446 --> 16:55.048
Kathy, Elaine, Sally...

16:55.081 --> 16:56.683
Judy Hoback.

16:56.716 --> 16:59.486
And, Miss Hoback,
you have no further information

16:59.519 --> 17:01.488
on campaign funds in your role
as bookkeeper.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.622
Is that correct?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.424
Nothing comes to mind.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.293
- That's a big surprise.
- And, uh...

17:07.327 --> 17:08.661
<i>what are the dates on that?</i>

17:08.695 --> 17:10.330
Just so we know when the, uh,

17:10.363 --> 17:11.798
nothing of interest occurred.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.234
If it's all right
with your counsel, of course.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.302
Of course it is.
Thanks for asking.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.709
That was...
February of this year

17:22.742 --> 17:24.677
to the present, I believe.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.781
Other than the time in which
I was working for Mr. Liddy.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.749
Liddy?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.184
- That's all the time we have.
- Hold on.

17:31.217 --> 17:32.585
You worked for G. Gordon Liddy?

17:32.619 --> 17:34.254
Wait a minute--hey,
just-just give us a minute.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.655
- ...busy afternoon.
- <i>No, no, no, no.</i>

17:35.688 --> 17:37.090
- One minute here.
- We've been more than

17:37.123 --> 17:38.324
accommodating.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.427
Now, if you'd like to submit
more questions,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.796
I would encourage you
to do so in writing.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.597
That is,
unless you'd like me to

17:44.631 --> 17:48.268
take the matter up
with Director Gray personally.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.137
- That won't be necessary.
- No?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.505
No.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.607
<i>Thank you so much
for all your time.</i>

17:54.641 --> 17:56.843
No, thank you.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.478
Thank you.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.679
Miss Hoback.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.417
Oh, and, Agent Magallanes.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.786
Don't forget to get your
parking ticket validated.

18:06.820 --> 18:08.621
<i>Sometimes people forget</i>

18:08.655 --> 18:10.323
<i>and they end up
having to pay a fortune.</i>

18:10.356 --> 18:12.225
Right. Thank you for the tip.
I appreciate it.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.127
Mm-hmm.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.234
Slimy motherfucker.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.269
Look at him.

18:25.405 --> 18:28.475
Right.
Where the fuck do we go now?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.389
Cool.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.558
<i>So how'd it go with
those FBI buttholes?</i>

18:45.592 --> 18:47.527
Should've seen them--
terrible haircuts,

18:47.560 --> 18:48.862
cheap polyester suits.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.197
They have no idea
with whom they are fucking.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.565
Stop it, man,
you're making me horny.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.800
<i>Yeah, I bet.</i>

18:53.833 --> 18:55.869
<i>Hey, uh, how's the convention?</i>

18:55.902 --> 18:58.571
It's great. You know, they sat
me in your seat, actually,

18:58.605 --> 19:00.206
- next to the big guy.
- <i>Are you-are you</i>

19:00.240 --> 19:01.641
<i>fucking kidding me?
Then wow.</i>

19:01.674 --> 19:03.409
Mm-hmm. Nixon himself.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.645
And let me tell ya something.
He is my kinda asshole.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.847
We talked for, like, a hour.
I started in about bowling.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.649
He lit up like a schoolgirl.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.819
Wow, really?
That--well, that is groovy.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.621
Congrat--congrats.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.222
<i>Hey, when are you gonna
get down here?</i>

19:16.256 --> 19:17.790
Because, uh, I heard
Ken Dahlberg

19:17.824 --> 19:19.359
is having a big party
at the Shore Club.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.394
<i>- Gonna be a wild scene.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.429
I know, I know, I'm, uh,
I'm catching the red-eye.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.266
Okay, good, good.
Just, uh, stop by my room.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.334
We will get ripped
before Agnew's speech, okay?

19:28.368 --> 19:30.403
Yeah. Hey, uh, do me a favor.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.771
Don't fuck all the birds,
all right?

19:31.804 --> 19:32.839
Save some for me, okay?

19:34.274 --> 19:36.676
<i>- Hell yeah, you horny dog.</i>

19:36.709 --> 19:39.646
Get your ass down here
and get that pussy, buddy.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.780
Owwooo!

19:40.813 --> 19:42.715
<i>Ow-owooo!</i>

19:42.749 --> 19:44.717
Owwoooo!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.386
Ow-owooo!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.769
All right, well,
I'll talk to you later, man.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.238
Yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.482
Mm. Hmm.

20:17.684 --> 20:18.918
Hello?

20:18.952 --> 20:21.854
Hey there, stranger.
What's happening?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.556
Oh, sorry, who is this?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.925
What? It's--it's John.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.527
John... John Dean.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.796
Sorry, am I--am I
catching you at a bad time?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.364
John.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.367
Um... I just cut myself.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.736
I'm trying to figure out
a can opener, and I--

20:36.769 --> 20:38.938
<i>Is it a General Electric?</i>

20:38.972 --> 20:41.541
- Is it what?
- <i>The can opener.</i>

20:41.574 --> 20:43.676
'Cause if-if it's not,
you-you should throw it out.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.378
You should get
a General Electric.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.614
They've got a--a safety guard.
I've had mine for years.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.382
<i>It's really, really great.</i>

20:49.415 --> 20:51.317
Are you-are--what is happening?

20:51.351 --> 20:52.785
Are you selling
can openers now?

20:54.320 --> 20:55.989
No, um, I'm sorry, um...

20:56.022 --> 20:58.491
<i>how-how are you?</i>

20:58.524 --> 21:01.294
I'm so good, I'm... I'm great.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.730
How are you? How's Miami?

21:03.763 --> 21:06.599
Miami is...

21:06.633 --> 21:08.434
nice, it's-it's nice.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.370
I don't have any time
to myself.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.572
I've been... tagging along
with the president.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.940
Really?

21:13.973 --> 21:16.542
<i>Yeah, I rode with him
on the-on the plane,</i>

21:16.576 --> 21:19.579
you know, the...
...Air Force One.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.314
I-I know what Air Force One is.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.049
I'm a fucking
flight attendant.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.684
<i>Sat next to him
at the convention last night,</i>

21:24.717 --> 21:25.918
<i>you know,
talked about bowling.</i>

21:25.952 --> 21:28.287
You know what?
I'm actually busy right now.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.556
Is there something specific
you needed?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.394
Yeah, well, actually,
I-I-I'm gonna be

21:34.427 --> 21:35.962
stopping through L.A.
on my way to Shanghai

21:35.995 --> 21:38.865
on the 15th and just wondered
if I could take you to lunch.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.400
Yes! No.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.468
No.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.737
- Oh.
- <i>I'm going sailing.</i>

21:45.905 --> 21:48.741
With... Billy.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.843
We're going to Catalina.

21:50.877 --> 21:52.345
Billy.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.714
Yeah. He's a friend from work.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.018
Right, sure, yeah, okay.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.020
Well, you know,
maybe another time.

22:01.054 --> 22:03.456
Maybe. Maybe another time.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.091
Hey, hey, before you go,
before you go,

22:05.324 --> 22:06.559
I just wanna say, um...

22:21.774 --> 22:23.443
Oh, for fuck's sake.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.902
<i>It's not
my purpose here</i>

22:49.936 --> 22:51.671
<i>to recount the great changes</i>

22:51.704 --> 22:53.873
that have been made
by the Republican Party

22:53.906 --> 22:56.142
under President Nixon. It--

22:56.375 --> 22:57.710
Hey, I was watching that.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.146
No more politics, darling.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.548
No more inaugurations,
no more conventions.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.951
Just blowin' up balloons.
And the red ones, please.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.119
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.554
Could you bring the gold
down over the blue?

23:08.588 --> 23:10.957
I want 'em together.

23:10.990 --> 23:14.093
<i>Yes, and then raise the whole
thing up a little bit.</i>

23:14.127 --> 23:16.562
<i>Exactly. That's nice.</i>

23:17.830 --> 23:19.766
Sweetheart?

23:19.799 --> 23:22.468
Did somebody deliver
these pills from the pharmacy?

23:22.502 --> 23:24.937
Uh, yes, uh,

23:24.971 --> 23:26.639
Dr. Feldman called.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.508
He was worried that you
might have forgotten

23:28.541 --> 23:29.842
to pick up your prescription,

23:29.876 --> 23:32.178
<i>so I sent Zolton out
to get it.</i>

23:34.480 --> 23:36.082
For your nerves, dear.

23:42.722 --> 23:46.025
And the whole time
I'm thinking, hell,

23:46.058 --> 23:48.027
John set me up good this time.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.662
Sounds about right.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.764
Anyway, I, um, I wander over

23:51.798 --> 23:53.466
and I take a seat
in his golf cart.

23:53.499 --> 23:57.069
He sits down, and Spiro has no
idea what to do about it.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.905
Hang on. You mean
he-he plays along?

23:58.938 --> 24:01.941
He plays along,
and not only that, get this.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.843
They play a round.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.444
We played half a round

24:05.478 --> 24:07.814
before I realized
I showed up on the wrong day.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.449
<i>So I just helped
myself to a game</i>

24:10.483 --> 24:11.918
<i>with the vice president.</i>

24:44.617 --> 24:46.219
I'm so sorry.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.754
<i>Excuse me.</i>

24:52.625 --> 24:54.493
Did he let him win?

24:54.527 --> 24:56.596
Did ya let him win?

25:31.163 --> 25:33.733
<i>What have you
done to it?</i>

25:33.766 --> 25:35.301
<i>What have you done
to its eyes?</i>

25:35.534 --> 25:36.802
<i>He has
his father's eyes.</i>

25:36.836 --> 25:38.137
Shoot.

25:40.773 --> 25:42.541
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

25:42.575 --> 25:44.243
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

25:44.277 --> 25:46.712
<i>Guy's eyes are normal!</i>

25:52.585 --> 25:54.954
<i>All right.</i>

25:54.987 --> 25:56.856
<i>Okay.</i>

26:04.931 --> 26:06.999
<i>Here comes the carpet. Yeah.</i>

26:07.033 --> 26:08.601
<i>Okay.</i>

26:08.634 --> 26:10.603
- <i>Ow. Ow!</i>
- <i>Okay. Okay.</i>

26:10.636 --> 26:12.838
Don't hurt me,
don't hurt me, don't hurt me!

26:12.872 --> 26:14.206
- Ah--leave me alone--
- Come on, come on.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.143
<i>It's okay, you're okay.
Go to bed.</i>

26:17.176 --> 26:18.844
What time is it?

26:18.878 --> 26:21.113
- We're home?
- Oh, bedtime. Bedtime.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.049
<i>What time is it?</i>

26:23.082 --> 26:24.317
- <i>It's bedtime.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

26:24.350 --> 26:26.018
Step.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.787
- Okay.
- Where's the railing?

26:27.820 --> 26:29.322
- I'm your railing.
- Okay.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.590
- <i>Okay. Okay.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

26:58.818 --> 27:00.853
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

27:00.886 --> 27:02.321
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

27:23.209 --> 27:24.777
Four more years!

27:26.712 --> 27:28.180
Four more years!

27:37.089 --> 27:39.191
- Name?
- Dean.

27:39.225 --> 27:42.094
John Dean.
We're guests of Mr. Dahlberg.

27:43.262 --> 27:45.398
I might be on there
as his plus one.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.967
Right this way.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.711
<i>This guy's a donor?</i>

27:58.744 --> 28:00.913
Basically funded
Operation Gemstone.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.015
He could buy and sell us both, wholesale.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.950
He's like
an Italian viscount.

28:04.984 --> 28:05.985
Oh, my God.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.056
Welcome to the big boy club.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.024
John, this is
the best day of my life.

28:13.259 --> 28:14.860
<i>John Dean?</i>

28:14.894 --> 28:16.695
Is that you?

28:16.729 --> 28:19.799
Haldeman said you had
a head of hair, but Jesus!

28:19.832 --> 28:21.834
Would you look at this kid?
Like a Kennedy...

28:21.867 --> 28:23.235
- Oh!
- ...with that head of hair!

28:24.236 --> 28:25.838
- Who are you?
- Dickie Moore, sir.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.006
Special counsel.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.308
Ah. One of those.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.877
Have a good night, son.
Go play.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.379
- Ah.
- So...

28:33.412 --> 28:35.381
how you enjoying
your first convention?

28:35.414 --> 28:37.383
- Ha.
- It is your first, right?

28:37.416 --> 28:40.152
Ah. You got kinda a virginal
look about you.

28:40.186 --> 28:41.821
Oh, sorry, I, uh, ha...

28:41.854 --> 28:43.355
Haldeman didn't exactly tell me

28:43.389 --> 28:46.892
the precise nature of the, uh,
get-together.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.327
It's a compliment.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.463
People love a fresh face
around here.

28:50.496 --> 28:53.065
You never know--next big
thing could be you.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.934
Oh. Ha. I...

28:54.967 --> 28:56.735
I don't know about that.

28:56.769 --> 28:59.738
I-I-I'm just a simple
junior counsel, is all.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.373
Oh, come now.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.409
Don't be modest
at a fuck party, son.

29:03.442 --> 29:05.978
It's unbecoming.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.847
Hey, Kennedy. Over here.

29:10.483 --> 29:12.284
It is the best time
in American history

29:12.318 --> 29:14.053
to be a woman.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.454
Yeah? You really think so?

29:15.488 --> 29:17.523
President Nixon
has done so much more

29:17.756 --> 29:19.258
than any other president

29:19.291 --> 29:21.994
to make America safe
to be feminine again.

29:22.027 --> 29:25.331
I just think he's so, um...

29:25.364 --> 29:26.899
enlightened.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.234
- Oh, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

29:28.267 --> 29:32.438
That's a really interesting
point, Candy.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.006
<i>Enjoying yourself, Dean?</i>

29:34.039 --> 29:37.109
Oh. Yeah-y-yes, sir. Yeah.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.378
- I mean...
- Shit.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.914
- Uh...
- Ooh.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.516
That's nice.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.120
Ahh...

29:48.154 --> 29:49.555
Oh.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.561
I mean, I-I had heard
that stuff like this

29:55.794 --> 29:57.997
happened at the convention,
but holy crap!

29:58.030 --> 30:00.132
We have a good time, son.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.135
Now, about that business
of ours.

30:03.169 --> 30:06.105
I'm gonna say this once.
I'm not gonna say it again.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.807
Y'all need to get
these squints off my back.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.576
Scuse me?

30:10.809 --> 30:13.145
The FBI.
They've been poking around.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.247
Asked about my name
on certain checks

30:15.281 --> 30:17.917
that were used to finance
certain operations

30:17.950 --> 30:19.051
in the Committee.

30:19.084 --> 30:20.586
I don't want you
to worry, Mr. Dahlberg.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.422
I speak with the full
authority of the presidency

30:23.455 --> 30:25.824
when I say that the, uh,
the agents in question

30:25.858 --> 30:28.327
are being closely monitored.

30:28.360 --> 30:31.497
You know, I remember guys
like you from the service...

30:31.530 --> 30:33.432
riding a desk
while guys like me

30:33.465 --> 30:35.501
were out putting their lives
on the line.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.937
You know what we called
guys like you?

30:37.970 --> 30:39.405
Butterbars.

30:39.438 --> 30:43.042
Two fat yellow bars

30:43.075 --> 30:46.212
and a paycheck
for doing nothing at all.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.148
- Ah--uhh--
- Now, you listen here,

30:49.181 --> 30:50.549
Butterbar.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.384
I don't need some horse shit
assurance from you

30:52.418 --> 30:54.186
about the powers
of the presidency

30:54.220 --> 30:55.588
because
I'm smart enough to know

30:55.621 --> 30:57.089
that you speak for Nixon

30:57.122 --> 30:59.191
about as much as
Miss Topeka over there

30:59.225 --> 31:01.327
speaks for the NAACP.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.995
I just need you to tell me

31:03.028 --> 31:04.463
you're gonna make my problem
go away--copy that?

31:04.496 --> 31:06.865
Yes. Yes, sir, I'll make it
disappear, I promise.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.934
It's gone. It's gone.

31:10.069 --> 31:13.005
Attaboy, Dean.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.873
Now... go enjoy yourself.

31:14.907 --> 31:16.275
Night's young.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.444
Christ, if I had your looks
in my day,

31:18.477 --> 31:21.213
I would've knocked up
half this town.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.017
<i>I'm a single mother,
okay?</i>

31:25.050 --> 31:27.653
I have a good job.
I don't want any attention.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.521
I don't think you have to
worry, Miss Hoback.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.957
- You're doing the right thing.
- Y-you gotta understand,

31:31.991 --> 31:34.026
these people have been
following me for weeks.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.561
What people?

31:35.594 --> 31:38.430
Who knows? White House? CIA?

31:38.464 --> 31:40.232
FBI?

31:40.266 --> 31:42.134
- It's not the FBI.
- No, I don't think it's FBI.

31:42.167 --> 31:44.036
I can tell you that much.

31:45.971 --> 31:47.206
You two really don't know

31:47.239 --> 31:48.974
what you're dealing with here,
do you?

31:49.008 --> 31:52.511
You think these institutions
you've dedicated your life to

31:52.544 --> 31:55.014
are set up
to carry out justice?

31:55.047 --> 31:57.182
To protect people?

31:57.216 --> 31:59.018
Well, they're not.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.520
They're set up to shield
people from justice.

32:01.553 --> 32:05.557
To protect certain people
from accountability.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.261
Mm. To protect the...

32:09.295 --> 32:11.130
the elites, the wealthy, right?

32:11.163 --> 32:13.232
<i>Not just them.
The shameless.</i>

32:13.265 --> 32:15.367
The ambitious.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.604
The complicit at every level.

32:18.637 --> 32:22.641
There is something terrible
going on at CREEP...

32:22.675 --> 32:27.146
and every one of those bastards
was in on it.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.716
Mitchell, Magruder,
McCord, Haldeman.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.418
Whoa, whoa. Haldeman?

32:34.320 --> 32:36.255
As in the president's
chief of staff?

32:36.288 --> 32:38.190
H-how do you know all of this?

32:38.223 --> 32:40.459
This can't be traced
back to me, okay?

32:40.492 --> 32:42.261
You have to promise.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.163
Judy, we don't sell out anyone
who does the right thing.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.435
You have our word.

32:54.340 --> 32:58.444
When Gordon Liddy was hired,

32:58.477 --> 33:01.213
I was assigned
to help him settle in.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.685
Mailbox keys, parking spots,
stuff like that.

33:06.719 --> 33:08.387
I even had to help him

33:08.420 --> 33:10.456
get his stupid poster boards
printed up

33:10.489 --> 33:13.092
for his stupid meeting.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.294
What meeting?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.464
Something about
sabotaging the Democrats.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.999
Operation Gemstone.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.472
He terrified me, you know.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.440
Liddy.

33:28.474 --> 33:31.477
I'm--I've had bosses
who were cruel, sadistic,

33:31.510 --> 33:35.614
but with Liddy
it was something...

33:35.647 --> 33:38.117
deeper, something...

33:38.150 --> 33:41.220
in his eyes like an...

33:41.253 --> 33:43.489
endless cave.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.058
Did Liddy ever speak to you directly

33:46.091 --> 33:48.560
- about Operation Gemstone?
- God, no.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.362
Of course,
he couldn't shut up

33:50.396 --> 33:52.364
about all his weird
social theories...

33:53.565 --> 33:56.335
...brain folds and bloodlines

33:56.368 --> 33:58.704
and malum in se.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.472
Malum in what?

34:00.506 --> 34:03.242
- Malum in se.
- Malum in what?

34:03.275 --> 34:05.444
Malum in se.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.746
The act of evil
in and of itself.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.550
The cold-blooded murder
of a child, for instance.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.820
Primal, natural evil.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.122
It stands in direct opposition

34:17.156 --> 34:19.258
to malum prohibitum,

34:19.291 --> 34:21.093
the laws of man.

34:21.126 --> 34:25.697
It's these new moral reckonings
that will purge the Earth

34:25.731 --> 34:28.734
of the weaknesses brought on
by sycophantic

34:28.767 --> 34:32.671
modern-day... sodomites.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.178
You look very nice today, Judy.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.456
Talk to you later.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.326
He really believed
this shit, you know.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.562
He thought he was
some kind of crusader

34:56.595 --> 34:58.363
on a holy mission.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.299
But if every evil is justified

35:00.332 --> 35:01.633
because it's done
in the pursuit

35:01.667 --> 35:04.636
of some sacred truth...

35:04.670 --> 35:07.673
then laws don't matter
anymore, right?

35:07.706 --> 35:10.642
The people don't even matter.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.445
How can a society
function like that?

35:13.479 --> 35:15.414
How can people live together

35:15.447 --> 35:18.250
without a shared understanding
of right and wrong?

35:47.579 --> 35:50.215
Beginning to think
you wouldn't show.

35:53.819 --> 35:54.920
What's the pillowcase for?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.822
Oof--hooh--

36:00.325 --> 36:03.295
Heard you called Hunt
the other day, good buddy.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.764
The rumor is, you're still
looking for assurances

36:05.797 --> 36:07.799
from our president.

36:07.833 --> 36:10.836
But the thing is...

36:10.869 --> 36:12.871
we're soldiers.

36:12.905 --> 36:15.474
There are no...

36:15.507 --> 36:17.543
assurances.

36:20.178 --> 36:24.383
No pardons, no clemency.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.919
You copy?

36:26.952 --> 36:28.587
I can't hear you.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.688
I copy!

36:30.923 --> 36:33.425
Now, you hear me good,
you fuck.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.527
If you ever threaten
to squeal again,

36:35.561 --> 36:38.363
it'll be the last time
you ever squeal.

36:38.397 --> 36:39.865
Do you copy?

36:39.898 --> 36:41.833
I-I copy. Yes.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.536
Yes--uhh!

36:54.980 --> 36:57.382
Are you certain
there's not a little...

36:57.416 --> 36:59.518
<i>Juden</i> rat in you?

36:59.551 --> 37:02.354
Hmm?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.992
I swear I can smell

37:07.225 --> 37:09.928
a little rat in there somewhere.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.287
What the fuck?

37:38.824 --> 37:40.359
Hello?

37:40.392 --> 37:43.261
Hey, it's me.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.263
<i>Hi. W-it's the middle
of the night.</i>

37:45.297 --> 37:47.432
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Oh, I-I--yeah.

37:47.466 --> 37:48.700
I-I'm sorry.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.435
- I just--
- <i>What's going on?</i>

37:50.469 --> 37:51.870
I-I was at this party tonight,

37:51.903 --> 37:53.739
and the whole time,
I was thinking about

37:53.772 --> 37:56.308
what I told you earlier
about the can opener.

37:56.341 --> 37:57.776
<i>The c--uh, the can opener?</i>

37:57.809 --> 38:00.779
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
J-just hear me out.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.781
Maybe I was being a little rash

38:02.814 --> 38:04.916
when I told you to
throw it out, you know,

38:04.950 --> 38:08.453
because I-I get that way
with appliances sometimes.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.789
I get scared, you know, I...

38:10.822 --> 38:12.624
And maybe it's the routine
that scares me

38:12.658 --> 38:15.327
or-or the thought of having

38:15.360 --> 38:17.629
one can opener
for the rest of my life.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.431
And even if I like
a certain can opener

38:19.464 --> 38:20.999
and can't imagine the rest of
my life without it,

38:21.033 --> 38:24.670
I do this thing where I just
wanna throw it all away.

38:24.703 --> 38:28.840
And... and instead of
sticking with what I have

38:28.874 --> 38:31.543
a-and building on something,
you know,

38:31.576 --> 38:33.512
I-I just...

38:33.545 --> 38:37.683
I look for
a new can opener and...

38:37.716 --> 38:40.419
I just want you to know
I hate that part of myself.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.355
I really do, and...

38:43.388 --> 38:45.323
...I'm sorry about that,

38:45.357 --> 38:48.360
about the...
about the can opener.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.031
<i>Hey, John...</i>

38:58.970 --> 39:01.473
...don't ever call me again.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.455
<i>Thanks to Miss Hoback,</i>

39:16.488 --> 39:18.924
we finally connected
Dahlberg's campaign checks

39:18.957 --> 39:20.692
to a secret fund.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.661
<i>This fund
was set up inside</i>

39:22.694 --> 39:25.063
the Committee to Re-elect
with the expressed intent

39:25.097 --> 39:28.867
of funneling money to a secret
political espionage unit.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.936
- Jesus Christ!
- <i>Now, if Miss Hoback</i>

39:30.969 --> 39:32.637
is correct, John Mitchell

39:32.671 --> 39:34.372
personally had control
of the fund.

39:34.406 --> 39:36.808
<i>And the web of conspirants
went all the way up</i>

39:36.842 --> 39:38.844
<i>to the president's
chief of staff.</i>

39:38.877 --> 39:41.446
We need to move fast on this,
start with the higher-ups.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.682
We don't wanna lose
the element of surprise.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.585
Well, there's no point in
losing the element of surprise.

39:49.921 --> 39:54.092
Well, if there's nothing else,
I've got a 2:00.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.795
Um, Mark will help you
with logistics,

39:56.828 --> 39:59.064
- and truly great work.
- Thank you, sir.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.166
- Really. Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.801
- Mark.
- Absolutely.

40:08.473 --> 40:10.108
Heavenly Father,

40:10.142 --> 40:11.810
guide me through
these treacherous waters

40:11.843 --> 40:13.478
and deliver me safely to shore.

40:13.512 --> 40:15.447
This is Louis Patrick Gray

40:15.480 --> 40:17.516
asking for Your loving hand.

40:17.549 --> 40:18.617
Amen.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.523
Peggy, can you get
the White House?

40:35.934 --> 40:38.837
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.718
Ooh--

40:54.953 --> 40:56.922
How are you?

40:56.955 --> 41:00.058
Just a little... tipsy.

41:00.091 --> 41:01.993
<i>...helicopter
which has arrived</i>

41:02.027 --> 41:04.696
<i>at the convention hall
on the helicopter pad</i>

41:04.729 --> 41:06.031
back behind the hall here

41:06.064 --> 41:09.034
with Mrs. Nixon and
the president, uh, emerging.

41:09.067 --> 41:11.036
Turn that darn thing off.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.676
Extraordinary
how he does that.

41:17.709 --> 41:18.810
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

41:21.112 --> 41:23.081
Oh, hello, darling.

41:23.114 --> 41:24.583
You know the gentlemen
from my firm.

41:24.616 --> 41:25.817
I know the gentlemen.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.919
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
and the birthday boy.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.154
I know you.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.989
My sugar bear.

41:31.022 --> 41:33.892
Mmm. Sugar bear,
birthday bear.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.694
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.196
- How are you, how are you?
- Very good.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.865
- And you!
- Okay...

41:41.499 --> 41:43.168
- Are you asking me to dance?
- The gentlemen

41:43.201 --> 41:45.503
are talking about football
because of...

41:45.537 --> 41:47.906
- Football. Okay.
- Oh, okay.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.941
You tease.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.644
He's teasin' me.
Yeah, teasin' me.

41:54.579 --> 41:56.514
Oh, she is spirited.

41:57.649 --> 41:59.718
You're a lucky man.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.688
Where's my little
bag from the pharmacy?

42:03.722 --> 42:06.291
Tula put it under the bar.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.728
- You're my favorite.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am.

42:23.909 --> 42:25.744
Ooh.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.326
Thank you, Dr. Feldman.

42:41.559 --> 42:42.761
<i>To John Mitchell</i>

42:42.794 --> 42:45.063
on the occasion of his
retirement from politics.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.898
Jesus, could you
imagine being married

42:46.932 --> 42:48.700
- to that woman?
- No.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.835
Fuckin' mop soaked
in alcohol, that one.

42:50.869 --> 42:53.305
<i>What an embarrassment
for the poor guy.</i>

42:53.338 --> 42:55.807
<i>I heard he begged
to stay on the campaign.</i>

42:55.840 --> 42:58.877
Phil told me Nixon's already
blaming him for Watergate.

42:58.910 --> 43:00.879
<i>Nobody gives
a shit about Watergate.</i>

43:00.912 --> 43:02.280
Not yet,
but when the lights come on,

43:02.314 --> 43:04.182
Mitchell will be the one
holding the bag--trust me.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.284
<i>Probably be happy
to go to prison</i>

43:06.318 --> 43:07.852
<i>to get away from Martha.</i>

43:52.897 --> 43:56.801
<i>And tonight,
I will not ask you</i>

43:56.835 --> 43:59.771
<i>to join our new majority</i>

43:59.804 --> 44:02.974
<i>because of what we have done
in the past.</i>

44:03.008 --> 44:05.210
<i>I ask your support
of the principles</i>

44:05.243 --> 44:08.880
I believe should determine
America's future.

44:08.913 --> 44:10.415
The choice...

44:10.648 --> 44:13.218
<i>the choice in this election</i>

44:13.251 --> 44:17.756
<i>is not between radical change
and no change.</i>

44:17.789 --> 44:20.158
<i>The choice in this election</i>

44:20.191 --> 44:24.429
<i>is between change that works
and change that won't work.</i>

44:46.317 --> 44:50.722
I begin with
an article of faith.

44:50.755 --> 44:53.825
It has become fashionable
in recent years

44:53.858 --> 44:55.794
to point out what is wrong

44:55.827 --> 44:58.263
with what is called
the American system.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.035
You're never gonna
believe this shit.

45:04.069 --> 45:05.937
This better be good, Mark.

45:05.970 --> 45:09.207
You're gonna wanna hear
all of this,

45:09.240 --> 45:11.976
and you're gonna wanna put it
in your little paper.

45:15.847 --> 45:17.882
<i>Can you believe this shit?</i>

45:17.916 --> 45:20.418
It's all gonna come back
on her.

45:21.453 --> 45:22.887
Who?

45:22.921 --> 45:26.091
On Judy. She's exposed.

45:26.124 --> 45:28.193
She's not exposed. What do
you mean, she's exposed?

45:28.226 --> 45:29.894
She's in the paper.

45:29.928 --> 45:33.164
It's not like they're gonna
assassinate a bookkeeper.

45:33.198 --> 45:36.768
Okay, well, that's not
the point, is it?

45:36.801 --> 45:39.304
We gave her our word, Angelo.

45:39.337 --> 45:40.505
If people can't count on us,

45:40.738 --> 45:41.940
who are they supposed to
count on?

45:41.973 --> 45:43.942
Would you calm down, please?

45:43.975 --> 45:45.944
Relax. We're gonna be fine.

45:48.213 --> 45:50.081
Look...

45:50.115 --> 45:53.151
the arc of the moral universe
is long...

45:53.184 --> 45:55.487
but it bends towards
the good guys.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.489
I promise.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.576
Sorry.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.113
You want some cake?

46:58.383 --> 46:59.817
No, thanks.

47:01.953 --> 47:04.956
Maybe you could take some
to those reporters out there.

47:04.989 --> 47:07.292
They're probably hungry.

47:16.401 --> 47:17.969
Good morning, gentlemen.

47:18.002 --> 47:21.573
Before I read your provisional
sentencing statement,

47:21.606 --> 47:24.943
<i>is there anything any of the
defendants would like to say?</i>

47:26.945 --> 47:28.913
No, Your Honor.

47:30.248 --> 47:32.417
Very well, then.

47:34.118 --> 47:36.120
The crimes you stand
convicted of here today

47:36.154 --> 47:38.289
are relatively minor in relief.

47:38.323 --> 47:42.393
<i>A simple break-in.
A harmless bugging.</i>

47:42.427 --> 47:43.861
<i>No physical damage.</i>

47:43.895 --> 47:46.431
But make no mistake--
there was damage.

47:46.464 --> 47:50.301
<i>You could say nobody got hurt,</i>

47:50.335 --> 47:53.338
<i>but the nation itself
was wounded.</i>

47:54.405 --> 47:58.243
<i>Because it's not the criminal
act that matters here today.</i>

47:58.276 --> 48:01.913
<i>It's the rot it reveals underneath.</i>

48:01.946 --> 48:04.449
Now, 100 times

48:04.482 --> 48:07.151
on the cheeks
to bring the life back.

48:07.185 --> 48:08.886
- Count for me.
- <i>Something is</i>

48:08.920 --> 48:10.655
<i>irreparably altered
when good men lie</i>

48:10.888 --> 48:11.956
<i>to protect the powerful.</i>

48:11.990 --> 48:13.891
See the life coming?

48:13.925 --> 48:15.360
<i>Because every lie
we allow</i>

48:15.393 --> 48:17.996
<i>erodes our sense of the truth.</i>

48:18.029 --> 48:19.330
How do I do it?

48:19.364 --> 48:21.432
<i>Until we become
not just liars</i>

48:21.466 --> 48:25.036
but we become the lie itself.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.372
<i>Gentlemen, I'm no fool.</i>

48:27.405 --> 48:30.108
I know this didn't start
with you.

48:30.141 --> 48:32.944
but in the absence
of concrete evidence,

48:32.977 --> 48:36.414
<i>I'm afraid it will most likely
end here.</i>

48:36.447 --> 48:38.983
I sentence you to
the maximum penalty

48:39.017 --> 48:41.219
allowable under federal law--
30 years in prison.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.154
<i>We'll reconvene</i>

48:43.187 --> 48:45.089
<i>in two months' time
to formalize sentencing.</i>

48:47.558 --> 48:48.693
All rise.

48:55.633 --> 48:56.668
Y'all gonna just stand around,

48:56.701 --> 48:58.202
or you wanna ask me some
questions?

48:58.236 --> 49:00.138
Mrs. Mitchell, Mrs. Mitchell,
is the president planning

49:00.171 --> 49:01.973
on making your husband
a scapegoat?

49:02.006 --> 49:05.276
My husband has done everything
to protect Mr. President,

49:05.310 --> 49:06.944
among many others, I might add,

49:06.978 --> 49:07.979
and they have all let him down.

49:08.012 --> 49:09.347
Attagirl, Martha.

49:09.380 --> 49:11.449
Mr. Mitchell
has become the fall guy.

49:11.482 --> 49:12.517
<i>Should the Nixon administration</i>

49:12.550 --> 49:14.152
be afraid of you,
Mrs. Mitchell?

49:14.185 --> 49:15.286
Well, I think you know
the answer to that,

49:15.320 --> 49:16.521
Claire Crawford.

49:16.554 --> 49:19.424
You know,
I used to hate that woman,

49:19.457 --> 49:21.726
but she is starting
to grow on me.

49:37.241 --> 49:38.576
It's a Cuisinart.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.978
It's a food processor. It--

49:42.380 --> 49:44.315
It's supposed to be the best
at-at-at...

49:44.349 --> 49:46.417
processing foods.

49:58.429 --> 50:00.631
"For slicing, blending,

50:00.665 --> 50:04.235
"chopping, shredding,
grinding, mincing,

50:04.268 --> 50:06.204

Mr. Mitchell and I

50:26.557 --> 50:28.092
to help this country.

50:28.126 --> 50:30.361
I'm a doer--I don't just
sit around and do nothin'.

50:30.395 --> 50:33.498
