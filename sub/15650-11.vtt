GEORGE AND VIRGINIA,
ABOUT YOUR SON HEFFER--

01:38.973 --> 01:41.184
IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION

01:41.267 --> 01:45.522
{\an1}THAT HE IS LONG OVERDUE
FOR HIS RITES OF PASSAGE.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.273
IS THIS SO?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.359
HAS HE BROUGHT HOME AN ELK YET?

WELL, YOU SEE,
HEFFER'S A GOOD BOY

02:06.000 --> 02:07.627
WELL, THAT AS IT MAY BE

02:07.710 --> 02:11.798
{\an1}BUT IT DOESN'T EXCUSE HIM
FROM HIS PACK RESPONSIBILITIES.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.324
He has poor hygiene.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.334
Let's go, boys!

20:52.417 --> 20:54.711
She's going to blow!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.427
(<i> children shouting</i> )

21:09.059 --> 21:10.227
Poor Jimmy.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.939
He'd have more friends
if he'd bathe once in a while.

21:14.022 --> 21:15.107
Tsk, tsk.

21:15.190 --> 21:16.900
Bad Jimmy.

21:28.912 --> 21:30.247
Poor Jimmy.

21:30.330 --> 21:34.668
A little oral hygiene
could have saved those teeth.

21:36.169 --> 21:37.462
With good hygiene

21:37.546 --> 21:39.464
you'll not only
have more friends

21:39.548 --> 21:42.175
and be less offensive
to those around you...

21:42.259 --> 21:44.386
(<i> whistling and chugging</i> )

21:44.469 --> 21:46.430
you could live longer.

21:54.146 --> 21:58.358
So remember, kids,
don't be a Jimmy.

21:58.442 --> 22:01.445
(<i> wobbly</i> ):
Wash those stinky places

22:01.528 --> 22:05.282
and say Hi! to hygiene.

22:05.365 --> 22:07.159
(<i> scratching</i> )

22:07.242 --> 22:08.744
(<i> crying</i> )

22:08.827 --> 22:10.912
OH, THAT ONE GETS ME EVERY TIME.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.707
(<i> clears throat</i> )

22:13.790 --> 22:15.709
WHAT ABOUT GETTING
MY TEETH CLEAN?

22:15.792 --> 22:19.296
STINK BLOSSOM, YOU GOT
OTHER PARTS THAT NEED CLEANING.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.589
WHAT?

22:20.672 --> 22:21.798
HEY!

22:21.882 --> 22:24.801
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SWABBED?

22:24.885 --> 22:27.137
OH, LOOK,
BURIED TREASURE.

22:28.346 --> 22:30.432
{\an1}ARGH! YOU'LL NOT BE
SWABBIN' THIS TREASURE.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.436
NOW WE
WRING YOU OUT.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.062
{\an3}HMM...

22:35.145 --> 22:38.148
LOOK AT THIS GREASY MESS.

22:38.231 --> 22:40.776
AND I SUPPOSE NOW
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME

22:40.859 --> 22:42.069
YOUR TEETH ARE CLEAN?

22:43.361 --> 22:45.822
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

22:46.239 --> 22:48.784
SPINACH TOOTH.

22:53.371 --> 22:56.291
{\an1}NOW, THIS IS GOING
TO HURT YOU A LOT MORE

22:56.375 --> 22:58.418
THAN IT'S GOING TO HURT ME.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.586
(<i> gulps</i> )

22:59.669 --> 23:02.339
OPEN WIDE.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.635
(<i> whirring</i> )

23:06.718 --> 23:08.970
(<i> Rocko screaming</i> )

23:09.054 --> 23:10.514
OW!

23:11.890 --> 23:13.642
HELLO, ROCKO.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.644
LET'S HAVE
A LOOK, SHALL WE?

23:17.771 --> 23:19.606
GIVE US A SMILE.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.150
{\an3}WELL...

23:22.234 --> 23:24.986
THAT OPERATION WAS A SUCCESS.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.656
UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS X-RAY OF YOUR HEAD

23:27.739 --> 23:29.366
TURNED UP A NEW PROBLEM.

23:29.449 --> 23:30.700
YOUR MIND.

23:30.784 --> 23:32.494
IT'S FILTHY!

23:32.577 --> 23:34.079
WE MUST GO BACK IN.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.497
AND CLEAN IT.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.414
(<i> screaming</i> )

23:36.498 --> 23:39.543
YOU ARE A LUCKY
DIRTY HEAD, THOUGH.

23:39.626 --> 23:42.587
WE HAVE A SPECIAL THIS WEEK
ON BRAIN WASHES!

23:42.671 --> 23:44.714
(<i> Rocko screaming</i> )

23:44.798 --> 23:47.467
{\an1}COME BACK,
MY LITTLE POO-BISCUIT.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.052
SHOOPY?
