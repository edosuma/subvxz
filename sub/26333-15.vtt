00:01.120 --> 00:04.540
Eddie: You can't imagine
how fragile life is until...

00:04.540 --> 00:07.080
No!!
...it's too late.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.960
When Jon left us,
he exposed the truth...

00:09.960 --> 00:12.330
He found your necklace.
Jon knew about us.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.710
...and our secrets
spilled out...

00:14.710 --> 00:17.120
Katherine:
So, every time I was with her,
you were humiliating me.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.710
Do you love her?

00:19.710 --> 00:21.120
...but we had to
push through...

00:21.120 --> 00:23.120
This is our baby.
Stop.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.790
I-I think we should
get a divorce.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.210
...for ourselves...

00:26.210 --> 00:28.420
You ever feel down...
Everybody feels sad, son.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.420
It's just a part of life.
...for each other...

00:30.420 --> 00:32.380
We have to be there
the same way Jon would be

00:32.380 --> 00:34.080
had it been one of us.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.210
I've known you
your whole life.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.580
You ever want to tell me
that Ella's a boy,

00:36.580 --> 00:38.120
I'm glad to hear that.

00:38.120 --> 00:40.540
...because what other choice
is there?

00:40.540 --> 00:42.120
Dare me to do anything.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.250
I dare you
to get chemo.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.580
Kevin: She's finally
gonna solve it.

00:46.580 --> 00:50.580
Both: Linda! Linda!
Linda! Linda!

00:50.580 --> 00:52.790
Linda! Linda! Linda!

00:52.790 --> 00:54.170
Damn it. It's jammed.

00:54.170 --> 00:56.540
What --
What's the pink stuff?

00:56.540 --> 00:58.580
Uh...

00:58.580 --> 01:00.580
Must be Rachel
and that damn gum.

01:01.670 --> 01:03.880
I-I'm sorry.
That was unprofessional.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.670
Just my luck.
23 sessions later,

01:05.670 --> 01:07.250
and I almost cracked it.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.830
Hey, the good news
is that we're both

01:08.830 --> 01:10.330
about to get out of here
pretty soon.

01:10.330 --> 01:11.580
Oh...
No offense, Kevin.

01:11.580 --> 01:12.710
No, I get it.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.460
Your tumor's small enough
to operate,

01:14.460 --> 01:16.620
and you don't need
ol' Kevin anymore.

01:16.620 --> 01:18.380
Gary: What do we have here?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.040
Oh, my God.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.120
Oh, my...
It's the love of my life.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.460
And Maggie.

01:26.460 --> 01:27.830
Wait.

01:27.830 --> 01:30.080
Hey.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.460
This is the Gary
you're dating?

01:31.460 --> 01:32.830
Ohh, Maggie.

01:32.830 --> 01:34.380
Just admit it, Linda.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.330
You want to have
your way with me.

01:35.330 --> 01:37.710
I do, Gary.
Just not the way you think.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.170
My way involves a chloroform rag
and a wood chipper.

01:40.170 --> 01:42.000
Wow.
That's on me.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.170
We had "Fargo"
going on a loop in here.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.330
Oh.
How do you know...

01:45.330 --> 01:46.420
Linda?
Yeah.

01:46.420 --> 01:48.620
Linda and I
fought cancer together.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.000
Hmm.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.580
And Jon and I
survived this --

01:51.580 --> 01:53.540
her obsession
with this nerd toy.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.120
Oh.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.330
Rachel put
her gum in here?

01:57.330 --> 01:59.170
I don't know what
she sees in you, Mendez,

01:59.170 --> 02:00.380
but you better
treat her right.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.880
He is. He's taking me
to Plymouth Rock today.

02:02.880 --> 02:04.290
It's the last thing
on my bucket list.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.880
Which you don't need
because bucket lists

02:05.880 --> 02:07.880
are for people who aren't gonna
make it, and you, my dear,

02:07.880 --> 02:11.830
now have an 80% chance
of beating this.

02:11.830 --> 02:13.500
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.290
Kevin: Hey, hey.

02:15.290 --> 02:17.250
Chair One, let's keep it
positive, all right?

02:17.250 --> 02:19.080
Big smiles!

02:19.080 --> 02:20.880
Thank you, Kev.
Thank you.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.460
First rule
of beating cancer --

02:23.460 --> 02:24.830
you got to...
Believe.

02:24.830 --> 02:27.830
...you can beat cancer.
Okay, Tony Robbins.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.250
You can
keep it positive,

02:29.250 --> 02:31.250
but I've got cancer surgery
on Monday...

02:31.250 --> 02:33.120
...so I'm gonna keep it real.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.710
All right, well, if we're really
keeping it on the 100,

02:34.710 --> 02:37.080
the Pilgrims did not actually
land on Plymouth Rock.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.330
We all know that,
right?

02:38.330 --> 02:39.710
They landed in Provincetown
or someplace,

02:39.710 --> 02:41.330
like, a month before.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.500
So what were
they doing for a month, huh?

02:43.500 --> 02:47.040
Just driving around?
Looking for parking?

02:48.580 --> 02:50.250
Tough room.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.460
Hey, so I found
that car seat.

02:52.460 --> 02:53.830
You were right.
You did give it to us.

02:53.830 --> 02:55.330
Oh.

02:55.330 --> 02:57.420
I think the Cheerios
were Theo's addition.

02:57.420 --> 02:59.330
Great.
Uh, not exactly.

02:59.330 --> 03:02.210
Apparently, it expired
six years ago. And, yes...

03:02.210 --> 03:03.580
...car seats do expire,

03:03.580 --> 03:06.250
according to all
the angry Mommy Blogs.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.750
Anyway,
I'm about to head

03:07.750 --> 03:09.750
into a mediation session
with Katherine,

03:09.750 --> 03:11.330
but why don't
I meet you later?

03:11.330 --> 03:12.540
I can help you
grab everything you need

03:12.540 --> 03:13.920
and install that car seat.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.620
That would be great.
Thank you.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.040
How's it all going
with Katherine?

03:19.040 --> 03:20.790
Pretty smoothly,

03:20.790 --> 03:22.170
all things considered.

03:22.170 --> 03:24.170
I'm so sorry, Eddie.

03:24.170 --> 03:28.420
Don't be.
What happened with us...

03:28.420 --> 03:29.960
well, Katherine
and I had problems

03:29.960 --> 03:32.580
long before that started.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.580
I should head out.
Just text me where and when.

03:35.580 --> 03:37.960
I'll meet you there.
Okay, thanks.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.540
Hey, Pop,
how you like your eggs?

03:44.540 --> 03:45.920
How many ways you know
how to make 'em?

03:45.920 --> 03:48.080
Scrambled it is!

03:50.210 --> 03:53.000
So how's the script writing
thing going?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Uh, it's good.
I'm in the third act.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.580
I could never
do what you do.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Hey, Walter!
What's...

04:01.000 --> 04:02.710
Hey, beautiful.
Hi.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.250
Check it out. My dad
was in the neighborhood...

04:05.250 --> 04:07.620
...and decided to stop by
with coffee.

04:07.620 --> 04:10.210
$5 coffee.
Oh, well, thank you.

04:10.210 --> 04:11.830
I was telling Rome
how I got a guy

04:11.830 --> 04:13.420
to redo
my hardwood floors cheap

04:13.420 --> 04:15.580
since the poor bastard's
between gigs.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.580
Well, good for you
and the poor bastard.

04:18.580 --> 04:22.380
Renee and I couldn't
decide between

04:22.380 --> 04:25.580
Sedona Red
and Rosewood,

04:25.580 --> 04:27.790
so I asked Rome
to be the tiebreaker.

04:27.790 --> 04:29.790
And we are going with...

04:29.790 --> 04:31.170
Sedona Red.
Mm!

04:33.790 --> 04:35.790
Oh, my God.
What?

04:35.790 --> 04:37.380
My sous chef, Sandra,
just heard

04:37.380 --> 04:38.790
that this anonymous
food blogger

04:38.790 --> 04:40.620
is coming into
the restaurant tonight.

04:40.620 --> 04:44.500
I mean, he or she is, like,
super influential.

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
Babe, a good review --
that -- that could make you.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.080
Or break you.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.080
I mean,
God, are we ready?

04:50.080 --> 04:52.290
What am I gonna make?

04:52.290 --> 04:54.290
Oh, I know what
I'm gonna make.

04:54.290 --> 04:55.710
Do I have cumin?

04:55.710 --> 04:57.500
Babe, I am sure
you're gonna be great.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.000
Deep down,
I think she heard me.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.460
Bon appÃ©tit.

05:03.460 --> 05:05.460
Good eggs.

05:05.460 --> 05:07.830
Thank you.

05:07.830 --> 05:09.670
Oh, hey, um,

05:09.670 --> 05:11.620
did I tell you
your brother's visiting?

05:15.290 --> 05:17.500
You did not.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.540
Yeah, he's staying
with me and Mom.

05:19.540 --> 05:21.710
I guess Stasia couldn't
get off work, so...

05:21.710 --> 05:23.040
we have him
all to ourselves.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.460
Lucky you.
Yeah, he's great.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.880
But...

05:29.880 --> 05:31.880
since we're redoing
our floors,

05:31.880 --> 05:34.710
I was hoping maybe you could
put him up a couple days.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.540
This $5 coffee
is gonna cost me more than $5.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.670
What?
Nothing.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.880
All right, well,

05:44.880 --> 05:48.170
you can sell your home now
and divide the proceeds

05:48.170 --> 05:51.960
or you can defer the sale
to a later date.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.460
Theo's never
lived anywhere else.

05:53.460 --> 05:55.580
No, I agree.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.380
It's best for Theo to stay here
in the house with his mom.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.960
All right. Have you, uh,
given any thought

06:00.960 --> 06:03.080
to how you're gonna divvy up
the communal assets?

06:03.080 --> 06:06.080
Like, uh, this table,
for example.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.170
Eddie can have
the table.

06:07.170 --> 06:09.460
No, you keep the table.
Really.

06:09.460 --> 06:11.120
You...take it.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.420
Huh. Most couples
fight to keep things,

06:17.420 --> 06:18.920
not the other way around.

06:18.920 --> 06:23.170
No, it's just...

06:23.170 --> 06:26.580
Uh, we just have a lot
of history with this table.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.920
Hmm.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.330
How about we decide
on the furniture

06:29.330 --> 06:31.290
when you're not
charging us $300 an hour?

06:31.290 --> 06:32.830
Sounds good, Counselor.

06:32.830 --> 06:35.210
Next up --
Theo's legal guardianship.

06:35.210 --> 06:37.620
You have designated
Jon and Delilah Dixon.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.040
Now, is that
still the plan?

06:39.040 --> 06:41.330
Jon passed away
last fall.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.540
I'm sorry.

06:43.540 --> 06:45.120
So would you like
to delegate Delilah, then,

06:45.120 --> 06:46.210
to be the sole guardian?

06:46.210 --> 06:48.040
No.
Probably not, no.

06:48.040 --> 06:51.420
I get it. You know,
many couples aren't comfortable

06:51.420 --> 06:52.790
with the idea of
a single-parent household.

06:52.790 --> 06:54.420
No, it's not that.

06:54.420 --> 06:56.830
I know plenty of single mothers
who are great

06:56.830 --> 07:00.080
at raising their children,
Delilah included.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.500
Well, yeah, I mean,
if she's still grieving, then --

07:02.500 --> 07:04.750
It's not her grief.
She slept with my husband.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.920
If he needed
a place to stay,

07:19.920 --> 07:21.210
why couldn't he just
ask me himself?

07:21.210 --> 07:23.080
Probably 'cause he knew
you'd make that face.

07:23.080 --> 07:25.620
I'm not making a face.
This is my face!

07:25.620 --> 07:28.460
You still mad about
Stasia dinging your car.

07:28.460 --> 07:31.620
They -- She ripped off
my fender and my taillight, Pop.

07:31.620 --> 07:33.880
Well, he had no money
to pay for it back then.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.880
He ain't got no money now,

07:34.880 --> 07:36.290
and I didn't want him
to pay for it.

07:36.290 --> 07:37.670
I just wanted him
to admit that she did it.

07:37.670 --> 07:39.670
I wanted him to take
responsibility.

07:39.670 --> 07:41.040
For once. For anything.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.830
Sometimes being
the older brother

07:42.830 --> 07:44.830
means being
the bigger person.

07:44.830 --> 07:48.460
Sometimes? Pops, I'm always
the bigger person!

07:48.460 --> 07:50.210
I had to give him my miniature
Empire State Building

07:50.210 --> 07:51.210
because he left his

07:51.210 --> 07:52.920
Statue of Liberty
on the train.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.290
A-And investing
in his "juice business"

07:54.290 --> 07:55.830
that was gonna
"pay for itself"?

07:55.830 --> 07:58.080
Side note -- itself
still owes me 2,000 bucks.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.580
And -- And, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

07:59.580 --> 08:01.670
Pretending that somebody else
backed into my car

08:01.670 --> 08:03.880
when my paint is
all over her damn bumper.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.170
Come on. Everybody knew Stasia
bumped into the car, Pop.

08:06.170 --> 08:07.580
We saw that.
Fine.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.500
Did we see that, though?
Fine.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.080
I will put him up
at a hotel.

08:12.080 --> 08:14.620
Because I am
made of money.

08:18.170 --> 08:20.620
Fine.
He can stay with me.

08:20.620 --> 08:21.620
Thank you.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.830
Hey, Mom?

08:24.830 --> 08:27.120
Can you drive me and Elliot
to Cambridge this afternoon?

08:27.120 --> 08:28.920
Sure thing, yeah.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.330
We're gonna
get something to eat

08:30.330 --> 08:32.120
and then go see
a movie at the Brattle.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.540
I've worked it out, and if we
get an appetizer or dessert --

08:34.540 --> 08:37.330
but not both -- I've got
enough cash to cover it.

08:37.330 --> 08:39.710
Wait, this sounds to me
like a...date.

08:39.710 --> 08:42.750
Mom...chill.
It's no big deal.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.120
No big deal?
Come on. It's like...

08:45.120 --> 08:47.920
what --
your first real date.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.080
Wait, I got
something for you.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.380
Okay.

08:52.380 --> 08:55.540
Where is it?

09:03.790 --> 09:05.620
Okay.

09:08.290 --> 09:11.040
Dad's money clip?

09:11.040 --> 09:13.290
Mm-hmm.

09:13.290 --> 09:15.880
I know he'd want you
to have it.

09:15.880 --> 09:18.290
And look at that.
Now you have enough

09:18.290 --> 09:20.000
for an appetizer
and dessert.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.580
Thanks, Mom.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.620
Eddie: Katie, please, look.

09:25.620 --> 09:26.880
W-We're never
gonna get through this

09:26.880 --> 09:28.880
if we can't
at least talk about it.

09:28.880 --> 09:31.500
Are you kidding?
What...

09:31.500 --> 09:34.670
I've done nothing
but try to get through this.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.420
Every day, I drop off Theo
in carpool,

09:40.420 --> 09:43.380
I see the looks
on the other mothers' faces.

09:43.380 --> 09:46.420
I know they know.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.380
I just put my head down,
try to get through it.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.210
You know what?

09:50.210 --> 09:53.000
I'm tired of just
getting through it.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.170
Hey, Katherine --
I'm late for work.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.710
He's a 35-year-old man.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.920
Omar can do that for himself.
It's the least I can do

10:08.920 --> 10:11.000
since the poor guy's
got to sleep on a couch.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.380
You asked me to do it a min--
Thanks, Ro.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.420
As a token of my appreciation,
I got you this.

10:16.420 --> 10:18.290
Oh, a box of chocolates.

10:18.290 --> 10:20.080
I ate all the ones
I knew you didn't like.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.670
Yeah.

10:22.670 --> 10:26.790
This place is great.
You and Gina are so blessed.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.580
It's not just blessed,
okay?

10:28.580 --> 10:31.000
This is --
This is hard work,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.830
being smart with our money,
sacrifices.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.580
I didn't mean "blessed"
as in you didn't deserve it.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.380
Isn't this
Mom's humidifier?

10:36.380 --> 10:38.670
D-Doesn't she need this
for her asthma?

10:38.670 --> 10:40.670
She wanted Omar to have it.
He has such dry skin.

10:40.670 --> 10:42.210
Yeah, mostly for my calves
and elbows.

10:42.210 --> 10:44.500
I mean, I moisturize,
but it's a struggle.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.420
You know, far be it for me
to judge anybody's bucket list,

10:49.420 --> 10:51.580
but I took many a field trip
to Plymouth Rock,

10:51.580 --> 10:53.580
and I think you should set
your expectations

10:53.580 --> 10:56.580
somewhere around..."eh."

10:56.580 --> 10:57.750
I know it's not
exactly sky diving.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.380
But when I was a kid,

10:59.380 --> 11:01.000
there was this rock
in our backyard.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.670
My brother and I used
to go out and pretend
that we were Pilgrims.

11:03.670 --> 11:05.500
So ever since I moved here,
I felt like,

11:05.500 --> 11:08.210
"Oh, I should go see the real
Plymouth Rock before..."

11:09.920 --> 11:12.000
You know.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.290
Well, you know the thing
about Pilgrims, right?

11:15.290 --> 11:17.500
They were all about
starting a new life,

11:17.500 --> 11:19.710
so, you know, they didn't
believe in bucket lists.

11:19.710 --> 11:22.120
Maybe they should've.
14 out of the 19 women

11:22.120 --> 11:23.170
didn't make it
through the winter.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.290
That's dark and funny.
Mm-hmm.

11:26.290 --> 11:28.920
What's up?
Can I borrow your air mattress?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.540
My brother's in town,
and apparently my couch

11:31.540 --> 11:32.710
isn't comfortable enough
for him.

11:32.710 --> 11:34.120
Your brother?

11:34.120 --> 11:35.710
Isn't that why you don't
have an air mattress?

11:35.710 --> 11:38.120
Look, we're about to hit the
road for Plymouth Rock, so...

11:38.120 --> 11:39.750
Drop it off on your way,

11:39.750 --> 11:41.880
and you can be the brother
that I don't murder.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.330
You're gonna
have to go around.

11:51.330 --> 11:54.080
Man: All right,
let's get a move on it.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.500
Ooh.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.540
Geez.
All right,
let's get her out of here.

11:59.540 --> 12:00.750
-We have a 38-year-old female.
-Ma'am, don't move.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.620
-Car's on its side.
-We're gonna get you out.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.330
-Okay. Okay.
-Let's get the Jaws of Life.

12:05.330 --> 12:07.880
Oh, gosh, Katie.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.580
-Sir, sir!
-Katherine?!

12:15.580 --> 12:17.750
What happened?
We need you to stay back.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.420
That's my wife!

12:19.420 --> 12:20.580
We're working to get her
out of the vehicle.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.500
-Katie?!
-Sir, please.

12:25.960 --> 12:27.620
-What happened?
-I don't know.

12:27.620 --> 12:30.170
I-I stopped,
it was clear.

12:30.170 --> 12:33.170
I started driving,
and then out of nowhere,

12:33.170 --> 12:36.250
this truck came barreling
through the stop sign.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.830
When I saw your car...

12:38.830 --> 12:41.670
I...oh, God...

12:41.670 --> 12:42.830
I thought...

12:47.830 --> 12:49.920
Okay, let's get you
to Boston General.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.120
I'm gonna be
right behind you.

13:07.460 --> 13:11.460
Hey, so, I got the T-shirts,
and I got one question.

13:11.460 --> 13:13.670
Are these 100% cotton?

13:13.670 --> 13:16.210
Because my cheek is telling me
this is a poly blend.

13:16.210 --> 13:17.620
Hey, Omar,
what is this?

13:17.620 --> 13:19.210
I-I thought
you were on vacation.

13:19.210 --> 13:20.830
It's a working vacation,
man.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.620
T-shirt biz is blowing up.

13:22.620 --> 13:25.040
Hey,
check your dresser.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.620
Guess what
it's filled with.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.170
T-shirts? Yeah.
T-shirts.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.040
My name's on the line,
man.

13:31.040 --> 13:33.460
I-I need this.
I need this. Come on, man.

13:33.460 --> 13:34.710
Mattress delivery.

13:34.710 --> 13:37.120
Omar: And you know something
else, man? We got --

13:37.120 --> 13:38.880
Oh, snap!
I'm gonna call you back.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.330
Yo, hey!

13:40.330 --> 13:42.830
Gary Mendez,
the Man with the Plan!

13:42.830 --> 13:44.920
Oh, my goodness, man.
Hey, did you get taller?

13:44.920 --> 13:47.500
No, I'm well into my 30s.
I think this is probably it.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.920
Hi, I'm Maggie.
Pleasure to meet you.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.920
Welcome. Can I get you
something, Maggie?

13:51.920 --> 13:53.710
Sparkling water, tea.

13:53.710 --> 13:56.710
You know, I travel around
with my own portable brewer.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.250
-Yet he forgot a toothbrush.
-We're good.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.290
We need to hit the road.
But I do need

14:00.290 --> 14:01.920
to use the bathroom
before we go.
Smart.

14:01.920 --> 14:02.920
Right this way.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.330
Oh, okay.
Look at that.

14:05.330 --> 14:07.120
-Do you like T-shirts?

14:07.120 --> 14:09.880
Uh...yeah. I think.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.540
I'm pretty sure
he's stealing my girlfriend

14:12.540 --> 14:14.540
right in front of me.
That's impressive.

14:14.540 --> 14:16.210
Yeah, I wouldn't
put it past him.

14:16.210 --> 14:17.920
He stole
my living room.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.710
Katherine:
Thank you.

14:20.710 --> 14:24.710
I am fine, really.

14:24.710 --> 14:25.880
You don't
have to stay.

14:25.880 --> 14:27.750
I'm not going anywhere.

14:27.750 --> 14:31.330
Let's ice that knee.
Doctor said every 20 minutes.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.920
Finally!

14:41.920 --> 14:43.670
Good use for peas.

14:46.500 --> 14:48.330
You okay?

14:48.330 --> 14:49.710
I was just thinking
how close I came

14:49.710 --> 14:51.960
to never seeing
Theo again.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.670
You can't
think like that.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.500
But we have to.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.960
We need to decide
on Theo's guardian.

15:03.790 --> 15:07.420
All right, let's rock.
Let's...

15:07.420 --> 15:08.790
...Plymouth Rock.
Oh...

15:08.790 --> 15:10.710
How many times
are you gonna say that?

15:10.710 --> 15:13.670
You're the one who put it
on your bucket list, so...

15:13.670 --> 15:15.250
three more times, at least.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.080
Gina, what's up?

15:20.080 --> 15:23.250
Hey, so, Katherine
was in a car accident.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.250
Oh, my God.
No, no, no. She's fine.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.880
Check each glass.
I want our blogger

15:26.880 --> 15:28.830
focusing on wine,
not water marks.
Yes, Chef.

15:28.830 --> 15:32.210
Uh, anyway, I made food
for her and Theo,

15:32.210 --> 15:34.120
and I would take it myself,
but I am so swamped.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.330
We'll be there.
Anything you need.

15:39.330 --> 15:42.830
Delilah: Wait, what movie
did you say you were gonna see?

15:42.830 --> 15:44.460
"Ghostbusters,"
Mrs. Dixon.

15:44.460 --> 15:45.710
I can't believe
you've never seen it.

15:45.710 --> 15:47.710
It's only
essential viewing.

15:47.710 --> 15:49.210
So you keep telling me.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.420
You guys are
so cute together.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.670
So, uh, you'll pick us
up at 5:00

15:55.670 --> 15:56.620
to take us
to the movie?

15:56.620 --> 15:58.920
Mm-hmm.

15:58.920 --> 16:00.500
Eddie:
Hey, you've reached Eddie.
Leave me a message.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.540
Hey, just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

16:02.540 --> 16:05.540
I waited around at the store
for, like, 45 minutes,

16:05.540 --> 16:08.920
and, uh, yeah,
just haven't heard from you.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.540
Okay.

16:10.540 --> 16:13.540
Well, if we want to
keep Theo with family,

16:13.540 --> 16:15.500
I really think your mother
is our best bet.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.250
I mean, look how well
she did with you.

16:18.250 --> 16:19.880
She doesn't
have the energy,

16:19.880 --> 16:24.120
and, uh, the language barrier
is too much.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.920
Besides, when me
and my sister moved out,

16:25.920 --> 16:28.330
she turned our room
into a sewing room.
Hmm.

16:28.330 --> 16:30.290
And, no, my sister
is also off the table.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.120
Tina? Yeah.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.500
She can't commit
to a nail polish color

16:33.500 --> 16:34.710
let alone
an eight-year-old.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.880
Rome and Regina?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.670
I mean, they don't
want a kid of their own.

16:38.670 --> 16:40.580
Why would they want ours?

16:40.580 --> 16:44.170
Yeah.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.170
You know,
there is one other option.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.580
Eddie...
L-- Hear me out.

16:47.580 --> 16:49.420
No.
Hey. Listen.

16:49.420 --> 16:53.000
Gary has matured a lot
since Jon died.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.330
He always
has our backs.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.460
Theo adores him --
You can't be serious.

16:57.460 --> 16:59.460
I get that you guys haven't
always gotten along --

16:59.460 --> 17:01.080
I'm not gonna
leave my child

17:01.080 --> 17:03.250
to someone who split a pizza
with his dog.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.750
Come on. That's not fair --
You know what's not fair

17:04.750 --> 17:08.380
is that we have to
do this at all.

17:08.380 --> 17:12.580
'Cause Delilah would've been
the perfect choice.

17:12.580 --> 17:16.170
But that's just one more thing
that got ruined.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.960
I keep trying to forget
what you did, but...

17:18.960 --> 17:21.460
it just keeps
screwing up our lives.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.000
Ooh.
No.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.580
Okay, wait, so you have no idea
who this food blogger is?

17:30.580 --> 17:31.790
And for all you know,
this blogger could be me.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.420
Apparently, laughter
is not on the menu today.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.040
Regina: No, I'm sorry.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.210
It's just I need this
to go well tonight.

17:38.210 --> 17:40.620
My last restaurant closed
after six months,

17:40.620 --> 17:42.420
and it didn't help
that the only review we got

17:42.420 --> 17:45.420
was a mean little blurb
in the Boston Phoenix.

17:45.420 --> 17:48.120
I'm still trying to figure out
why "quaint" is a bad thing.

17:49.460 --> 17:52.330
There she is,
and look at that tum-tum.

17:52.330 --> 17:54.790
What happened to Plymouth Rock?

17:54.790 --> 17:56.790
Plymouth Rock is happening.
Just...

17:56.790 --> 17:59.380
hasn't happened yet.
Yes, but now Katherine is home,

17:59.380 --> 18:00.580
so we're gonna
drop this food off,

18:00.580 --> 18:01.960
and then we're gonna
hit the road.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.580
Why, what's up
with Katherine?

18:03.580 --> 18:05.580
She was in a car accident.
But she's okay.

18:05.580 --> 18:06.830
Oh, my God.

18:06.830 --> 18:08.460
No. Ed took her
to the hospital.

18:08.460 --> 18:11.040
He's been with her all day.
She's good.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.920
Of course, yeah.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.420
Eddie: So, your mom
picked Theo up from school.

18:18.420 --> 18:20.000
He's psyched to be
spending the night with her.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.620
They're sewing.

18:24.380 --> 18:26.620
I'm so sorry.
Give me a sec.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.290
Go ahead.

18:28.290 --> 18:30.080
Hey.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.670
Hey. I-I heard
about Katherine.

18:32.670 --> 18:35.710
Yeah, she's doing okay,
thank God.

18:35.710 --> 18:39.880
Yeah. Just please tell her
I'm -- I'm thinking of her.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.830
Look, I am so sorry
I didn't show up this morning.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.210
Don't be. I-I-I get it.

18:45.210 --> 18:46.620
Of course.

18:46.620 --> 18:49.460
I-I can stop by tomorrow.
No need.

18:49.460 --> 18:53.830
I-I got the car seat
and already installed it.

18:53.830 --> 18:56.500
Okay, good.

18:56.500 --> 18:59.880
I should've called sooner,
Delilah. I...

18:59.880 --> 19:01.750
I was just
so worried about her.

19:01.750 --> 19:05.750
I get it.
It's good that you're there.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.120
It's just, after everything
I've done,

19:08.120 --> 19:11.960
I need to make it right.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.330
Thanks for understanding.

19:16.670 --> 19:19.500
Hey.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.500
Where's Elliot?
What happened to the movie?

19:21.500 --> 19:24.710
He went home.
His mom picked him up.

19:24.710 --> 19:25.920
Everything okay?

19:25.920 --> 19:27.670
Everything's fine.

19:30.330 --> 19:31.670
Sweetie, I'm sure
whatever happened --

19:31.670 --> 19:33.670
Mom.

19:33.670 --> 19:35.960
Can we just go?

19:35.960 --> 19:38.380
Yeah.

19:44.290 --> 19:47.120
Omar: One time it.
One time it.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.120
Nope.
Through the five hole.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.380
Mm! Score!

19:49.380 --> 19:51.380
Sorry about that, Ro-Ro.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.620
Uh...

19:52.620 --> 19:55.620
So, what's up?
Stasia couldn't get off work

19:55.620 --> 19:58.420
to come up
while you were here, huh?

19:58.420 --> 20:01.830
Eh, I don't know, man.
Me, uh...

20:01.830 --> 20:04.540
Me and Stasia are going
through a thing right now.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.580
What kind of thing?

20:06.580 --> 20:08.790
I didn't even want to tell Dad,
'cause you know how he gets.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.830
Me and Stasia are...

20:11.830 --> 20:14.420
probably getting
divorced.

20:14.420 --> 20:17.540
We're getting
divorced, Rome.

20:17.540 --> 20:20.380
I'm sorry to hear that,
man.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.710
Don't act
like you liked her, man.

20:22.710 --> 20:23.880
I like Stasia.

20:23.880 --> 20:26.460
I mean, I-I do. I do.
Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

20:26.460 --> 20:27.880
It's like
you never forgave her

20:27.880 --> 20:29.880
for backing into
your precious Porsche.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.500
Which she did not do,
by the way.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.880
It was so long ago, man.

20:34.880 --> 20:36.330
It was a Tesla,

20:36.330 --> 20:37.710
and I don't remember
busting my taillight

20:37.710 --> 20:39.460
or whatever it was
she did, but...

20:40.750 --> 20:42.170
Going through a breakup,

20:42.170 --> 20:43.670
that's -- that's got to
be pretty rough.

20:43.670 --> 20:46.420
Don't sit here and act like
you know what I'm going through,

20:46.420 --> 20:48.040
'cause you don't.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.500
We got two different lives,
and you know it.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.880
You know,
my life ain't as...

20:55.120 --> 20:56.710
...perfect as you think
it is, man.

21:00.540 --> 21:01.830
Just a few months ago,
man --

21:01.830 --> 21:03.750
Somebody back
into your fancy car?

21:06.380 --> 21:08.750
You know...forget it.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.920
-Whoo.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.210
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:21.210 --> 21:25.210
If we want to make it
to the Rock today,

21:25.210 --> 21:26.710
then we need
an exit strategy.

21:26.710 --> 21:28.920
If you're suggesting that
we drop this on the doorstep,

21:28.920 --> 21:30.500
ring the bell,
and run away --

21:30.500 --> 21:32.120
No, we are
not doing that.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.290
Okay, fine.
We'll go inside,

21:33.290 --> 21:34.710
we'll give Katherine
this food,

21:34.710 --> 21:36.080
and we'll say,
"Hey, Katherine,

21:36.080 --> 21:37.620
we're so glad
that you're okay."

21:37.620 --> 21:39.000
'Cause we are glad
that she's okay.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.250
Oh, bup, bup,
bup, bup!

21:40.250 --> 21:42.460
Do not
take off that coat,

21:42.460 --> 21:44.830
and definitely
do not sit down.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.620
All right,
I know that I may be

21:46.620 --> 21:48.330
raining on your mission,
Commander Gare,

21:48.330 --> 21:50.710
but Katherine
was in a car accident.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.960
Sympathy? That's good.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.210
Yeah, lock in on that.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.210
-Can I take your coat?
-No, why would you do that, Ed?

21:58.210 --> 21:59.380
It's nippy out there.
-Okay.

21:59.380 --> 22:00.460
-Hey, Katherine.
-Hey.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.750
Um, Regina made you
50,000 calories

22:02.750 --> 22:04.670
of her delicious
truffle mac.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.040
That is so sweet.
Thank you guys for bringing it.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.880
Oh, ow.
-No. Katherine.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.170
-Ow.
-Whoa, whoa.

22:10.170 --> 22:12.170
-I'm good.
-You all right?

22:12.170 --> 22:14.670
-Your head?
-Uh, yeah, I'll be fine.

22:14.670 --> 22:17.080
I'll be fine. The car,
on the other hand, um,

22:17.080 --> 22:18.460
probably not enough
mac and cheese in the world

22:18.460 --> 22:21.290
to save that thing.
-Well, if you want someone

22:21.290 --> 22:23.290
to get tough with
the other guy's insurance,

22:23.290 --> 22:24.790
that's me, okay?
That's what I do.

22:24.790 --> 22:26.380
This --
This is the one time

22:26.380 --> 22:27.960
where my boring job
becomes exciting.

22:27.960 --> 22:30.330
Okay, well,
I'll keep that in mind.

22:30.330 --> 22:32.750
Um, there is, actually,

22:32.750 --> 22:33.790
something I want to
talk to you about.

22:35.330 --> 22:39.330
Ed and I have to designate
a legal guardian for Theo...

22:39.330 --> 22:41.290
and we want it
to be you, Gary.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.670
Oh.

22:48.040 --> 22:51.580
Whoa. Hmm.

22:51.580 --> 22:54.170
Yeah, we went through
all our options --

22:54.170 --> 22:55.880
friends, relatives --

22:55.880 --> 22:58.460
and when Theo's
with his Uncle Gary,

22:58.460 --> 23:00.670
he's laughing
and he's loved.

23:00.670 --> 23:03.170
You've hit your head very hard.

23:03.170 --> 23:06.000
And you know how much
I love Theo,

23:06.000 --> 23:08.920
but, uh...that's why it
shouldn't be me, you know?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.500
'Cause being "Uncle Gary"
is very different

23:10.500 --> 23:12.170
from full-time
parenting.

23:12.170 --> 23:14.040
I mean, I wouldn't
want to screw the kid up.

23:14.040 --> 23:15.420
Eddie: The fact that you're
worried about screwing him up

23:15.420 --> 23:17.790
is exactly
why you will be great.

23:19.420 --> 23:22.250
I'm touched, truly,
um,

23:22.250 --> 23:24.460
but I promise,
you can do way better than me.

23:24.460 --> 23:27.040
Okay, hey,
I know that you're, like,

23:27.040 --> 23:28.750
trying to be the funny guy
all the time,

23:28.750 --> 23:32.080
but I'm gonna be really
serious with you right now.

23:32.080 --> 23:36.040
If I'm alive
a year from now,

23:36.040 --> 23:37.580
it's because of you.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.330
You literally
saved my life.

23:40.330 --> 23:42.750
See, I think...

23:42.750 --> 23:44.670
I think you're confusing me
with Gary Busey.

23:44.670 --> 23:47.250
Don't do the thing.
What, make a joke?

23:47.250 --> 23:49.210
Mm-hmm.
And then get you
into the bedroom --

23:49.210 --> 23:51.040
No, you took care
of me.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.580
You are the reason
that I am in the 80%.

23:53.580 --> 23:56.540
I'm alive
because of you.

23:58.210 --> 24:01.500
That is exactly the kind
of support and love

24:01.500 --> 24:02.670
that Theo would need.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.460
You wouldn't
let me say no,

24:08.460 --> 24:10.500
so I'm not gonna
let you say no.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.880
It's a little awkward
because they heard all of that.

24:25.620 --> 24:27.460
Okay, all right.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.620
Well, hopefully,
it'll never come to that,

24:28.620 --> 24:31.170
but apparently, I'm in,
and I assume

24:31.170 --> 24:34.420
that comes with a stipend
of some sort.

24:34.420 --> 24:36.790
-Yeah.
-Well, then, it's decided.

24:36.790 --> 24:38.380
He's taking your kid
and all your money,

24:38.380 --> 24:40.170
and, uh, we'll come up
with the finer points

24:40.170 --> 24:42.420
when the lawyer's
walking again.

24:42.420 --> 24:43.920
Right now,
we have to go get to the --

24:43.920 --> 24:46.420
That's the -- Isn't that the
thing that Linda goes crazy for,

24:46.420 --> 24:47.790
the --
with the links on it?

24:47.790 --> 24:49.830
Oh, no way. Yeah.

24:49.830 --> 24:53.290
We have a friend
who's obsessed with that thing.

24:53.290 --> 24:55.830
Do you think that Theo
would mind if we borrowed that?

24:55.830 --> 24:58.670
Oh, no, take it.

24:58.670 --> 24:59.670
It's Eddie's.

24:59.670 --> 25:02.120
Yeah. Borrow.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.170
Hmm.

25:07.380 --> 25:09.330
No, sorry, D.

25:09.330 --> 25:10.420
I'm not answering that call.

25:10.420 --> 25:12.380
We have a selfie
to take with a rock.

25:13.790 --> 25:16.170
Uh-oh.
Don't do it.

25:16.170 --> 25:18.330
Oh, no.
No, don't you do it. That --

25:18.330 --> 25:19.540
Hi, what's up?

25:19.540 --> 25:20.960
Hey, sorry.
I know you guys

25:20.960 --> 25:22.750
are on your way
to Plymouth Rock.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.750
It actually took the Pilgrims
less time to get there.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.710
What is up?
Danny had
his first official date

25:27.710 --> 25:29.330
with Elliot today,

25:29.330 --> 25:31.330
and I'm not sure
what happened,

25:31.330 --> 25:32.960
but he's locked
in his room --

25:32.960 --> 25:35.540
Okay, and I'm assuming Elliot's
not in there with him?

25:35.540 --> 25:37.540
He won't come out.
He won't talk to me.

25:37.540 --> 25:38.750
I don't really know
what happened.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.790
I don't know
if he's just heartbroken.

25:40.790 --> 25:43.750
Do you think -- Do you think
maybe you could talk to him?

25:43.750 --> 25:45.380
Yes, of course.

25:45.380 --> 25:47.210
We will swing by
as soon as we get back.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.330
Are you kidding me?
It's Danny. We're going.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
Okay.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.920
Change of plans.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.290
We'll be right there.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.790
Thanks.

26:01.880 --> 26:03.790
See the woman
in the yellow top?

26:03.790 --> 26:04.830
Sandra:
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.000
She's taking pictures
of the food.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.670
She's got to
be the blogger.

26:07.670 --> 26:10.500
Yeah, but, Gina, half of
Instagram is pictures of food.

26:10.500 --> 26:12.790
So, what, I got to kiss every
ass in this place tonight?

26:12.790 --> 26:14.000
I have ChapStick
in my purse.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.040
Oh, they're here.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.830
Hey, Omar.
-Gina!

26:20.830 --> 26:22.500
-Good to see you.
-This place looks great.

26:22.500 --> 26:23.790
Aw, thank you.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.580
You looking
for any investors?

26:26.580 --> 26:28.670
You hanging in there?
-Barely.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.500
-You're 10 minutes late.
-Right on time.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.500
-Which is...
-Both: 10 minutes late.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.380
It's okay,
because I know the owner.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.750
Where's Mom?

26:36.750 --> 26:39.380
She decided to stay home.
Her asthma's acting up.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.750
Well, it's because
he took her freaking...

26:42.750 --> 26:44.380
Unbelievable.

26:44.380 --> 26:46.040
How about
I start everyone off

26:46.040 --> 26:49.290
with a large,
relaxing drink, hmm?

26:52.830 --> 26:56.250
Ah.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.250
Hey, bud.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.420
What's going on?

26:59.420 --> 27:01.380
I don't want to
talk about it.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.460
All right. Well...

27:11.000 --> 27:12.420
...I'll just be here.

27:18.290 --> 27:19.880
What's wrong with Danny?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.790
I don't know.

27:21.790 --> 27:22.880
Well, I'll tell you

27:22.880 --> 27:24.080
what's wrong with me.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.250
I didn't ask.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.080
I had cheese,

27:27.080 --> 27:29.290
and I'm lactose intolerant.

27:29.290 --> 27:32.120
Sorry.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.880
I'm sorry.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.580
Why?

27:36.580 --> 27:38.580
No, they're not coming in
for the surgery.

27:38.580 --> 27:40.880
I'd rather they come
afterward anyway.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.710
My mom can be a little...

27:44.710 --> 27:46.790
Uh, let's just say I'm glad
I'll be on painkillers.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.790
So, what's going on?
Did he say?

27:50.790 --> 27:52.330
Yeah, it's something
you said.

27:52.330 --> 27:53.750
Very funny.
No, I'm serious, D.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.290
It was something
you said.

27:56.290 --> 27:57.250
Did you tell them
they look cute together?

27:57.250 --> 28:00.290
Yeah,
because they did.

28:00.290 --> 28:03.170
Okay, well, apparently
Elliot is not as open

28:03.170 --> 28:04.290
with his family
as Danny is with you,

28:04.290 --> 28:06.330
so he was
a little freaked out

28:06.330 --> 28:09.380
that his buddy's mom commented
on his sexual orientation.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.170
Oh, God.

28:11.170 --> 28:13.790
You mean --
Yeah, that's right.

28:13.790 --> 28:15.120
You outed
a 12-year-old.

28:20.420 --> 28:23.040
Hey.

28:23.040 --> 28:25.830
Choosing Gary, I, uh,
think that meant a lot to him.

28:27.210 --> 28:28.580
It definitely
meant a lot to me.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.080
I knew Gary was probably
the right choice from the start.

28:34.080 --> 28:36.000
But to be honest,
the reason I, uh,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.120
didn't want him
is because...

28:39.120 --> 28:40.710
you did.

28:40.710 --> 28:42.920
Somewhere along the way,

28:42.920 --> 28:47.080
arguing against you
became my default.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.250
And that's not okay.

28:49.250 --> 28:52.000
Well, it's not like
I didn't deserve it.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.790
No, Eddie.

28:53.790 --> 28:56.500
I stopped giving you the benefit
of the doubt a long time ago.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.790
And that's on me.

29:00.790 --> 29:03.880
I need to take
some of the responsibility

29:03.880 --> 29:05.460
for where we ended up.

29:11.290 --> 29:13.330
It was
an honest mistake.

29:13.330 --> 29:16.120
And Elliot will bounce back.
Kids are resilient.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.330
How am I gonna
raise this kid on my own

29:17.330 --> 29:20.210
when I can barely parent
the two that I have?

29:20.210 --> 29:21.920
Oh, come on.
That's ridiculous.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.170
What? It's true.
I'm leaning on everybody,

29:23.170 --> 29:26.120
and I just can't...
I just -- Ah.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.960
What if
I'm not enough?

29:29.960 --> 29:32.580
Not enough?

29:32.580 --> 29:37.040
D, those kids --

29:37.040 --> 29:38.830
What they've been through
the last seven months

29:38.830 --> 29:40.620
is the hardest thing they'll
go through in their lives,

29:40.620 --> 29:42.960
and you got them through it.
You're getting them through it.

29:42.960 --> 29:46.210
You're more than enough.
You don't have to be perfect.

29:46.210 --> 29:49.420
You just...
got to be there.

29:52.580 --> 29:53.920
Yeah.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.830
Was I right about
that wine pairing?

29:57.830 --> 29:59.420
Oh, most definitely.
Oh, so happy.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.080
And how's
that cheesecake?

30:01.080 --> 30:03.040
Oh, so good. Thanks.
I knew you were
gonna have room for it.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.210
Did you like the oysters?
Man: Yeah.

30:04.210 --> 30:06.670
I snuck in
a couple extra.

30:06.670 --> 30:09.290
Omar: So, yeah, anyway,
I don't want to jinx it,

30:09.290 --> 30:12.250
but I think this T-shirt thing
could be pretty big.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.670
My supplier
said the Northeast

30:13.670 --> 30:16.080
is a pretty hot market
right now.

30:16.080 --> 30:18.040
Walter:
Landing a deal like that
while you're on vacation!

30:18.040 --> 30:20.500
Yep.
This guy never stops!

30:20.500 --> 30:23.040
Of course, I'll need to keep
my overhead low, so,

30:23.040 --> 30:25.040
Dad, I might have to
hole it up with you

30:25.040 --> 30:26.920
for a little bit longer,
if that's cool.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.290
I'll hook my old man up
with some T-shirts.
Hey, no.

30:29.290 --> 30:30.670
I insist
on paying for them.

30:30.670 --> 30:32.080
All right.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.880
Hey, how about a toast?

30:34.880 --> 30:36.250
To the Howard men.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.210
Together again!

30:40.000 --> 30:42.330
What's with you,
Mope-a-dope?

30:42.330 --> 30:44.710
We're actually toasting
to the fact

30:44.710 --> 30:46.880
that he's using
y'all again?

30:46.880 --> 30:48.120
Don't give me that look.

30:48.120 --> 30:49.330
You know exactly
what you're doing.

30:49.330 --> 30:52.250
You're letting Mom and Dad
bail you out as always.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.210
And by the way,
Mom's asthma is acting up

30:54.210 --> 30:56.000
because you took
her humidifier.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.120
You took it.
-Hey! Hi!

30:58.120 --> 30:59.710
Why is table four so loud?
-We're -- We're good.

30:59.710 --> 31:02.170
We're okay.
I'm -- I'm -- I'm good.

31:02.170 --> 31:04.380
We're all good?
Everyone's happy.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.580
Okay.

31:06.580 --> 31:08.380
Hey, so,
the butter you're eating?

31:08.380 --> 31:11.000
We make it in-house.
My apologies.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.170
This is not the place
for any of this.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.080
I'm sorry.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.380
That's why
he's on those pills.

31:20.580 --> 31:22.380
Are you serious?

31:22.380 --> 31:24.290
That's what
embarrasses you?

31:24.290 --> 31:28.080
My depression that I'm trying
to do something about?

31:28.080 --> 31:31.040
This thing -- This thing that
I'm dealing with every day,

31:31.040 --> 31:32.460
and you throw it
in my face.

31:32.460 --> 31:34.170
And, oh, wait a minute,
Omar gets to drift through life

31:34.170 --> 31:35.580
like a damn prince!

31:35.580 --> 31:38.040
Don't you see
what you are doing?

31:38.040 --> 31:40.460
You made him what he is!
Oh, and what am I?

31:40.460 --> 31:43.080
-I can't believe you --
-Hi, again, table four.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.670
I'm sorry.
I mean, I know today

31:55.670 --> 31:56.830
was supposed to be
all about your bucket list.

31:56.830 --> 31:58.250
It ended up being
about everybody else.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.040
It's okay.
We got to spend the day

32:01.040 --> 32:02.290
with all of
our favorite people.

32:02.290 --> 32:04.500
We do plenty of that.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.420
We can go to Plymouth Rock
when I'm well again.

32:07.420 --> 32:10.170
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
When you're well again?

32:10.170 --> 32:13.580
Dr. Bloom, that sounds
awfully optimistic.

32:13.580 --> 32:15.000
I don't know.

32:17.420 --> 32:20.040
I've spent so long
living with death,

32:20.040 --> 32:22.580
I...it became a habit.

32:22.580 --> 32:24.790
But helping our friends today
made me realize

32:24.790 --> 32:29.170
that I really want to --

32:29.170 --> 32:31.790
I want to be there
to scream

32:31.790 --> 32:33.920
when Gina's restaurant
wins Best in Boston,

32:33.920 --> 32:37.250
and I want to smoke a cigar
when Delilah's baby's born.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.880
And --
Don't do that.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.830
You're gonna beat cancer
and start smoking cigars?

32:40.830 --> 32:42.380
No.

32:42.380 --> 32:46.540
My point is my old bucket list
was about the past.

32:46.540 --> 32:50.080
My new bucket list...

32:50.080 --> 32:52.210
is about the future.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.210
All my life,
I have tried so hard

33:14.210 --> 33:15.710
to be whatever
you wanted.

33:15.710 --> 33:18.880
Just to make you proud.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.500
It's never enough.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.330
I'm never enough.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.460
You've never treated me
the way you treat Omar.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.120
Ever.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.420
You done
with your tantrum?

33:28.420 --> 33:31.250
I love your brother.
I do.

33:31.250 --> 33:34.620
But he's always needed
all the help he can get.

33:34.620 --> 33:37.040
I mean,
look at him out there.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.620
Still going
from job to job?

33:39.620 --> 33:42.170
Now he's getting
a divorce.

33:42.170 --> 33:45.080
You don't think
I've figured that out?

33:45.080 --> 33:49.830
I know you have
your problems.

33:49.830 --> 33:52.670
But, son, you're...

33:55.880 --> 33:58.670
I don't have to
worry about you.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.330
Maybe you should.

34:05.750 --> 34:06.920
'Cause...

34:09.460 --> 34:13.080
Yeah.

34:13.080 --> 34:15.080
Sometimes you should.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.500
So, I just got
a text from Sandra.

34:24.500 --> 34:26.120
Apparently the blogger
was never coming.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.960
Her source got
Someday mixed up

34:28.960 --> 34:30.960
with a place
called Sunday.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.000
I'm sorry, baby.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.540
On the plus side, we have never
gotten better Yelp reviews.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.460
So how's that going?

34:49.290 --> 34:53.210
I realized that
I was just so angry at my dad

34:53.210 --> 34:55.580
for everything he was
doing for my brother,

34:55.580 --> 34:59.920
and I couldn't yell at him,
so I took it out on Omar.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.380
Whether he meant to
or not,

35:02.380 --> 35:04.880
my dad pitted us
against each other.

35:04.880 --> 35:07.580
Sounds like you're not the only
one who should be in therapy.

35:09.830 --> 35:12.250
I'm gonna go to bed.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.170
You should
stay up a bit.

35:44.170 --> 35:46.380
So...

35:46.380 --> 35:48.000
antidepressants, huh?

35:52.830 --> 35:55.880
Yep.
I heard about it

35:55.880 --> 35:59.670
'cause Dad sorta mentioned it
to the entire restaurant.

36:03.210 --> 36:04.830
How long you been
taking them?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.290
Couple months.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.880
I'm glad you're doing
what you got to do.

36:20.250 --> 36:23.290
Actually...

36:23.290 --> 36:25.620
this last year
has been really rough.

36:28.040 --> 36:29.920
How about you?

36:34.080 --> 36:35.710
Gary: Ooh-hoo.

36:35.710 --> 36:36.920
All right.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.750
Here's the plan,
Yeah.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.960
You drive around the block
as many times as you need to

36:40.960 --> 36:42.380
so that we don't get a ticket.

36:42.380 --> 36:45.120
Oh, um, I don't think
anyone is going to give...

36:45.120 --> 36:46.790
this a ticket.

36:46.790 --> 36:48.620
Yeah.

36:48.620 --> 36:50.460
Now I got to kiss the dome
for good luck.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.920
Thanks.

37:05.960 --> 37:07.540
-Kevin.
-Hey, Gary.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.170
Dude, look what
Mags and I found

37:09.170 --> 37:11.790
for our sourpuss friend next
time she comes in for chemo.

37:11.790 --> 37:14.960
Promise me you will get a video
of Linda's face

37:14.960 --> 37:17.790
when she sees
this thing.

37:17.790 --> 37:19.920
What?
Um...

37:21.420 --> 37:22.790
She's gone.

37:22.790 --> 37:25.500
No.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.040
Gary, Linda had
a pulmonary embolism.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.830
Don't tell me that, Kev.
No.

37:33.830 --> 37:35.670
I'm sorry, Gary.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.120
Don't tell me that,
man.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.120
She was sitting right there
this morning in that chair.

37:39.120 --> 37:41.290
We all saw her.
She was doing fine.

37:41.290 --> 37:43.080
Cancer patients,
they have a higher chance

37:43.080 --> 37:46.500
of blood clots.

37:46.500 --> 37:47.670
I'm sorry.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.540
Call me
if you need anything.

38:14.540 --> 38:16.210
I promise.

38:20.040 --> 38:21.080
Thank you.

38:24.420 --> 38:27.210
About the table...

38:27.210 --> 38:30.210
I'd like to keep it,
if that's okay.

38:30.210 --> 38:34.420
No. I want it
to stay here.

38:34.420 --> 38:36.670
It's the table
that got us Theo.

38:56.380 --> 38:58.380
Either I'm getting
a little tipsy here,

38:58.380 --> 39:00.960
or these fumes are
starting to go to my head.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.460
Mm-hmm,
and that's why

39:04.460 --> 39:06.380
maybe you should've
worn one of these.

39:06.380 --> 39:07.580
âª Everything's fun
to a young heart âª

39:07.580 --> 39:09.420
Yeah,
I was worried that

39:09.420 --> 39:11.830
looking like Hannibal Lecter
with a paintbrush

39:11.830 --> 39:14.170
might turn you off.
Oh, well,
that's your first mistake,

39:14.170 --> 39:17.000
because Anthony Hopkins
is my jam.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
Balding,
middle-aged men.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.380
That is --
That is good to know.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.170
I also make exceptions

39:24.170 --> 39:25.960
for devilishly handsome
rockstars.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.170
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

39:27.170 --> 39:29.120
You know any?

39:31.120 --> 39:32.710
Oh, wait, wait!
What?

39:32.710 --> 39:34.330
Oh, no. Oh, shoot.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.830
Look what we did.

39:36.830 --> 39:39.620
Must have been
from my button.

39:39.620 --> 39:40.620
I love it.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.670
âª Yeah,
you'll be kicked around âª

39:42.670 --> 39:45.040
Every time we look at it,
we're gonna remember tonight.

39:45.040 --> 39:48.460
âª And you'll be broken
into better shape âª

39:51.120 --> 39:56.330
âª Broken into better shape âª

39:56.330 --> 40:01.120
âª I was one more mistake
from losing it all âª

40:02.330 --> 40:07.790
âª Everything
I'd ever worked for âª

40:07.790 --> 40:12.000
âª Things can go wrong
when they should be right âª

40:12.000 --> 40:15.460
âª And it can haunt you âª

40:15.460 --> 40:19.460
âª The rest of your life âª

40:19.460 --> 40:22.620
âª If you let it âª

40:22.620 --> 40:25.000
âª La-da-da-da-da-da-da âª

40:25.000 --> 40:30.420
âª It'll let you down âª

40:30.420 --> 40:33.420
âª Love, if you want the truth âª

40:33.420 --> 40:36.250
âª Anything's possible âª

40:36.250 --> 40:39.040
âª You can walk upon the moon âª

40:39.040 --> 40:41.880
âª Or you can watch it roll âª

40:41.880 --> 40:44.460
âª It's never in the stars âª

40:44.460 --> 40:47.580
âª It's in your heart âª

40:47.580 --> 40:51.750
âª Yeah, you'll be kicked around
but get up anyway âª

40:51.750 --> 40:57.420
âª You'll be broken
into better shape âª

40:57.420 --> 41:03.080
âª Broken into better shape âª

41:03.080 --> 41:04.250
âª When the pieces rearrange âª

41:04.250 --> 41:05.670
Oh, hi.
Hi.

41:05.670 --> 41:07.210
Did you give Linda
her new toy?

41:07.210 --> 41:09.250
Yep.

41:11.420 --> 41:12.830
Is everything okay?

41:12.830 --> 41:15.250
Oh, yeah.

41:16.670 --> 41:19.460
It's gonna be
even better tonight

41:19.460 --> 41:21.380
when we make it
to Plymouth Rock.

41:21.380 --> 41:23.420
Why? You said we had
the rest of my life.

41:23.420 --> 41:27.040
I did say that.
And we do.

41:27.040 --> 41:29.620
But the rest of your life...

41:29.620 --> 41:31.000
âª Oh, oh, oh âª

41:31.000 --> 41:32.620
...starts right now.

41:32.620 --> 41:34.620
âª Oh, oh, oh, oh âª

41:34.620 --> 41:36.210
Come on.

41:36.210 --> 41:37.580
Bust some tune-age.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.250
Busta Rhymes?

41:39.250 --> 41:41.420
As long as
it's not "Bust a Move."

41:44.290 --> 41:45.880
Yes.

42:04.420 --> 42:05.750
Hey.

42:05.750 --> 42:08.330
Man: Where are you?

42:08.330 --> 42:10.170
You need to leave it alone.

42:10.170 --> 42:12.120
You're only gonna
make things worse.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.750
I know.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.710
But, Mitch...

42:15.710 --> 42:17.330
she's pregnant.
