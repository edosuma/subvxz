02:13.500 --> 02:14.892
- [Pamela] Is that a Hugh?

02:14.916 --> 02:16.934
- It's hard so don't worry about that.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.809
Now, listen, you wanna-

02:18.833 --> 02:19.643
- I'm done.

02:19.667 --> 02:21.726
It's more exciting in the glass cube.

02:21.750 --> 02:22.809
Meet me there.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.101
- Sure, bitch.

02:24.125 --> 02:27.351
Now, listen, the secret to this business-

02:27.375 --> 02:28.851
- Oh, you have the secret?

02:28.875 --> 02:30.851
Yeah, I have one, too.

02:30.875 --> 02:31.916
- Do tell.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.666
- I have an idea.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.184
- You need a million
likes to have an idea.

02:39.208 --> 02:42.309
This whole fucking business is based on

02:42.333 --> 02:45.892
followers, and hashtags and likes.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.351
Fuck you if you don't have likes.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.267
- You wanna hear it?

02:49.291 --> 02:51.017
- Of course, bitch.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.041
Do it.

02:58.416 --> 02:59.851
Okay.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.559
Have I told you that I love you?

03:02.583 --> 03:03.684
- No.

03:03.708 --> 03:05.375
Only sponsor for me.

03:06.458 --> 03:09.851
- I've always believed
in you, you know that.

03:09.875 --> 03:10.875
- Oh.

03:11.583 --> 03:13.017
This one?

03:13.041 --> 03:13.851
Really?

03:13.875 --> 03:14.809
- I'm an eight.

03:14.833 --> 03:15.833
- Oh.

03:21.125 --> 03:23.434
I'm sorry, I have to go now.

03:23.458 --> 03:24.851
- Hurry up, baby.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.041
And good luck.

04:00.166 --> 04:03.125
- Okay. Okay, okay, see you, see you.

04:06.666 --> 04:09.726
- You realize you are far
more beautiful when you smile?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.642
Like while you're on TV.

04:11.666 --> 04:12.946
There are three kinds of people.

04:14.625 --> 04:15.518
Those who feel depressed

04:15.542 --> 04:19.476
because they see other
better than themselves.

04:19.500 --> 04:24.184
Those who feel better because
they see other worse off,

04:24.208 --> 04:26.559
and those that they learn
to compare themselves

04:26.583 --> 04:28.309
only against themselves.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.208
- But that's brilliant!

04:31.625 --> 04:35.101
But of course, I would
expect that from you.

04:35.125 --> 04:38.017
You are Roberto Cere, I
follow you on Instagram!

04:38.041 --> 04:40.809
- You need no introduction,
Pamela Galante.

04:40.833 --> 04:43.809
This is my book. I hope
it's gonna help you.

04:43.833 --> 04:45.517
This is a present from me to you.

04:45.541 --> 04:46.541
And.
- Oh!

04:51.458 --> 04:52.458
Thank you.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.059
"Io Ci Sono".

04:55.083 --> 04:57.333
You know, you may be right.

04:58.416 --> 05:00.000
I should want more from life.

05:00.875 --> 05:04.726
- There is not a better time
to start than the present.

05:04.750 --> 05:05.892
Have a nice day.

05:05.916 --> 05:06.916
- Thank you.

05:15.541 --> 05:18.101
- Do you want me to connect
your phone to the Bluetooth

05:18.125 --> 05:20.892
in order to listen to
some other radio station?

05:20.916 --> 05:21.893
- No, man.

05:21.917 --> 05:25.166
I understand Italian. Just don't speak it.

05:26.708 --> 05:28.559
Not by choice.

05:28.583 --> 05:29.583
I don't think.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.060
- You know. I know.

05:31.084 --> 05:33.642
I just find it incredible that someone

05:33.666 --> 05:35.476
who doesn't speak Italian

05:35.500 --> 05:36.851
could be appointed to our government.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.809
- I know. I know.

05:38.833 --> 05:41.934
I mean like when I first
came to your country

05:41.958 --> 05:44.892
and I met Sylvia and we
started our first businesses,

05:44.916 --> 05:47.309
I could have never imagined that

05:47.333 --> 05:50.934
an Italian American kid from Michigan

05:50.958 --> 05:52.851
could ever have been appointed

05:52.875 --> 05:55.351
to the Italian Ministry of Culture.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.101
I mean, it's, it's insane.

05:57.125 --> 05:58.559
- I know only in Italy.

05:58.583 --> 05:59.750
- Only in Italy.

06:00.583 --> 06:01.583
Oh geez. Hold on.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.226
Oh, it's the wife, you're
not here. I'm on a plane.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.642
- Oh actually, sir.

06:09.666 --> 06:10.934
According to my calculation,

06:10.958 --> 06:12.726
you are in a car on the way to the hotel.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.166
- Oh, you are good!

06:18.875 --> 06:20.476
I'm just, I'm just kidding, honey.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.541
It was for the kid.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.726
Marco, the driver. But, never mind.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.267
How are? Sweetie, I miss
you so much already.

06:28.291 --> 06:30.208
And yeah, we landed, we're,

06:31.291 --> 06:35.684
we're already in Greece, driving,

06:35.708 --> 06:36.767
but we're driving into a tunnel.

06:36.791 --> 06:38.976
We're driving into a Greek tunnel

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
going into the underground.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.434
So if you, if I lose you
don't look behind you.

06:44.458 --> 06:47.500
You'll, you'll disappear.
You'll get dragged into Hades.

06:49.291 --> 06:51.434
I'm having a hard time hearing you though

06:51.458 --> 06:53.059
because of the reception.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.392
This kind of spot.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.517
No, I'm not on vacation.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.791
I'm, hello?

07:01.625 --> 07:02.625
Hello.

07:04.416 --> 07:07.559
God, I love that woman.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.684
Listen, I need a write
up on Athens, all right?

07:10.708 --> 07:12.309
So gimme something prepared.

07:12.333 --> 07:15.226
You know, all the shit you do that this...

07:15.250 --> 07:16.601
Boy look at you.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.226
That's the,

07:19.250 --> 07:20.250
you're incredible.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.226
You know, every,

07:22.250 --> 07:25.250
every successful man needs the
right woman to lie to, Marco.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.916
Maybe one day you'll meet
her when the time is right.

07:31.625 --> 07:35.684
- Wait, one day mean that I'm
gonna meet some girl to lie to

07:35.708 --> 07:38.017
or I'm gonna meet your wife?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.958
- I really don't know.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.708
- Okay, see that over here?

07:52.500 --> 07:55.625
This is one of our city's
most important monuments.

07:56.666 --> 07:59.226
I won't apologize for the bird excrement,

07:59.250 --> 08:00.875
but it is good luck, right?

08:02.500 --> 08:05.226
- The guy who said getting
shit on by a bird, Marco,

08:05.250 --> 08:07.250
was shat on by a bird.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.351
He's beautiful.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.601
What the fuck are we
doing here? What's next?

08:13.625 --> 08:18.625
- Oh, I got this for you.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.476
- Olympiacos.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.559
That's good thinking.

08:21.583 --> 08:22.583
- Thanks.

08:23.375 --> 08:26.476
- These guys killed Lazio on
the Champions League, right?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.892
- I'm impressed that you know that.

08:28.916 --> 08:30.833
- You gotta study your prey, my friend.

08:35.208 --> 08:38.642
All right. You know that
little pedal next to the brake?

08:38.666 --> 08:40.291
- Yeah.
- Step on it.

10:10.375 --> 10:14.208
There's not a giant baby
on the loose is there?

10:15.541 --> 10:16.352
- No, sir.

10:16.376 --> 10:19.726
It, it's a mock up of my
parents' latest project.

10:19.750 --> 10:20.750
- Okay.

10:21.875 --> 10:22.934
How's that?

10:22.958 --> 10:24.101
- Well basically they're living in

10:24.125 --> 10:26.708
a bigger glass cube for a month.

10:27.541 --> 10:29.517
- What do you mean living?

10:29.541 --> 10:34.541
- I mean, eating, drinking,
you know, sleeping. Maybe.

10:36.291 --> 10:37.333
- Where do they shit?

10:38.625 --> 10:40.059
- That's the mystery.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.083
They're artists.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.226
- David Blaine lived in a glass cube.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.041
He was dangling above London.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.708
He's a magician. So, I guess
he made his shit disappear?

10:52.500 --> 10:53.791
Artists sell their shit.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.125
Write that down.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.351
- And sell it?

10:59.375 --> 11:00.476
- Exactly.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.809
- Okay.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.434
I've written down the bullet points

11:03.458 --> 11:05.208
for the reform bill of the theater,

11:06.291 --> 11:08.476
basically fighting for the intellectual.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.267
- Ah, intellectuals.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.291
- They vote, sir.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.250
- I love the theater people.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.750
Can the bipolar vote twice?

11:35.791 --> 11:36.851
All right. Champagne.

11:36.875 --> 11:37.875
- Yeah.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.684
- You do speak Italian, sir.

11:44.708 --> 11:47.476
- Just enough to get by
with waiters and girls.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.517
- And I left you some
lasagna in the freezer.

11:49.541 --> 11:51.059
You have to put in the
oven for 20 minutes,

11:51.083 --> 11:53.392
but I left you some instruction anyway.

11:53.416 --> 11:55.726
- All right. So how much is
this fiasco gonna cost me?

11:55.750 --> 11:58.601
- Mm. I'll have the
final number by Monday.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.892
- And you charged it all
to the campaign finance?

12:00.916 --> 12:01.916
- Of course!

12:02.708 --> 12:04.976
- See, we can't be, you know, too clean.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.810
Voters,

12:05.834 --> 12:07.892
they don't trust you otherwise.

12:07.916 --> 12:09.059
And make sure you leak that.

12:09.083 --> 12:09.893
- Okay.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.559
- De Angelis. I hate this bastard.

12:11.583 --> 12:12.393
- Yeah.

12:12.417 --> 12:14.476
We checked his mother into a
clinic for Alzheimer's sir.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.726
- Yeah.
- 4,000 voters.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.559
- Oh, of course he does.

12:17.583 --> 12:18.583
- 4,000.

12:19.458 --> 12:21.517
- Ciao, my friend.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.791
I'm so sorry to hear about your mother.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
How is she?

12:27.416 --> 12:30.250
Si, I, no, that's terrible.

12:31.500 --> 12:32.500
Yeah, it's awful.

12:34.541 --> 12:38.559
Yeah, these, these illnesses
they're, they're such a,

12:38.583 --> 12:41.166
they're such a terrible part of life.

12:43.416 --> 12:44.226
- Oh!

12:44.250 --> 12:45.060
- Man, really!

12:45.084 --> 12:47.541
I feel, I feel terrible
for the both of you.

12:48.916 --> 12:51.041
No, that, it's absolutely my pleasure.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.059
You know, the, the, the,
the clinic administrator.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.476
He's a very good friend of mine.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.642
It was my absolute pleasure.

12:58.666 --> 13:01.767
No, she's in she's she's
she's in very good hands.

13:01.791 --> 13:02.791
- I, ah!

13:03.541 --> 13:04.934
- He's crying.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.750
- Don't forget the building amnesty.

13:07.833 --> 13:11.142
- No, no, no, we've been
very busy, haven't we?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.708
We've been very busy with
the electoral campaign.

13:16.666 --> 13:19.226
No, I can see the light at
the end of the tunnel though.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.666
Let's hope it's not a drain.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.875
Look as long as we're speaking amnesty,

13:28.083 --> 13:31.392
if I win the election, I'm
gonna be very good to you,

13:31.416 --> 13:33.059
but I want you to know

13:33.083 --> 13:34.833
you gotta be very good to me too, huh?

13:40.208 --> 13:41.809
Say it.

13:41.833 --> 13:43.216
First class.

13:44.316 --> 13:45.150
Marco will cover.

13:45.251 --> 13:46.934
Yeah, well, he'll, he'll,
he'll take care of it.

13:46.958 --> 13:49.083
From appetizer to dessert.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.476
Dessert.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.740
How do you say dessert?
- Dolce.

13:55.625 --> 14:00.226
Yeah, yeah, just, and say hello
to your 4,000 voters for me

14:00.250 --> 14:02.976
and our, our, our prayers are with you.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.916
Si, si. Okay, okay.

14:06.458 --> 14:07.791
Jesus Christ.

14:10.833 --> 14:15.434
Apparently we have to take care
of dinner for 4,000 people.

14:15.458 --> 14:18.976
Keep it down to, I don't
know, 15 euros a head, yeah?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.309
- What if we held a dinner party

14:20.333 --> 14:22.059
at the Balfour restaurant?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.309
- I like it.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.851
- I will call them?
- No, no.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.809
That's the shogun.

14:26.833 --> 14:27.916
That's great.

14:28.833 --> 14:30.101
Kendo.
(shouts)

14:30.125 --> 14:32.976
See, that's a, that's a
kiai right there, right?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.976
You can, you can, you can,

14:35.000 --> 14:37.809
you can cripple your
opponent with your voice

14:37.833 --> 14:39.517
even before the blade touches them.

14:39.541 --> 14:41.892
Even before the fight, you can win, right?

14:41.916 --> 14:44.642
Your horror is your belly.
You need a big belly.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.351
None of these flat abs. You need a belly.

14:46.375 --> 14:47.976
That's your horror, and your shin,

14:48.000 --> 14:51.226
Your shin is the energy
that comes right outta your,

14:51.250 --> 14:52.392
right outta your head.

14:52.416 --> 14:54.351
You don't know a thing
I'm talking about, do you?

14:54.375 --> 14:55.750
- I don't, sorry.

14:57.916 --> 14:58.767
Whoop!

14:58.791 --> 14:59.685
Hey, watch your step.

14:59.709 --> 15:01.392
Watch that step.

15:01.416 --> 15:02.416
Hup!

15:03.333 --> 15:05.267
- This is actually my
parents' bedroom, sir.

15:05.291 --> 15:08.166
- Relax. They're in a box
somewhere aren't they?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.017
What they don't know won't hurt 'em.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.041
- You're right.

15:13.916 --> 15:15.809
What if we move the dinner to Bebo?

15:15.833 --> 15:17.934
I can it down to 10 euros there.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.666
- Including appetizer and dessert?

15:21.916 --> 15:23.017
Yes, sir.

15:23.041 --> 15:24.642
And after dinner drinks, sir.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.666
- Sweet.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.434
All right. Let's run through it.

15:28.458 --> 15:29.892
- Okay.

15:29.916 --> 15:31.559
15 Minutes to noon.

15:31.583 --> 15:34.476
Cameras go live online, everywhere,

15:34.500 --> 15:36.375
but here, and the relax room.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.851
Five minutes to noon, she arrives.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.309
11:00 PM.

15:42.333 --> 15:46.226
He shows up through this
door with a gun in his hand

15:46.250 --> 15:49.500
and then ties you up.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.791
Sir. Your hat on the bed.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.666
It's bad luck.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.666
And this is my parents' last installation.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.916
It's a room dedicated to relax

17:27.250 --> 17:29.791
and aromatherapy and chromotherapy.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.250
- Yeah. I don't remember this.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.477
Oh yeah. What is that?

17:37.501 --> 17:39.309
That, it smells the divine.

17:39.333 --> 17:44.291
- Oh, it's a mix of wild herbs
and Mediterranean spices.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.166
- God, can I put that on my salad?

17:48.500 --> 17:50.434
Is it legal?
- Yeah.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.458
- It shouldn't be.

17:52.916 --> 17:55.101
Oh my God.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.541
No, I wanna live in here.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.000
No, better yet. Shoot me now, I'm done.

18:01.000 --> 18:01.768
- No, sir.

18:01.792 --> 18:04.392
There are no guns in these
house. My parents are pacifists.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.708
- Of course they are. They live in a box.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.500
It's all right. I still love them.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.517
Okay. As of now, my phone is off.

18:13.541 --> 18:14.541
- Yep.

18:15.458 --> 18:18.101
What if suddenly something
happens in the government?

18:18.125 --> 18:21.726
How can I reach you?
Should I just show up?

18:21.750 --> 18:22.643
- Listen,

18:22.667 --> 18:24.642
there are men far greater than us

18:24.666 --> 18:27.142
slipping into that tall
black patent leather

18:27.166 --> 18:30.351
woman's police boot called
Italy tonight, my friend.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.375
We're fine.

18:40.166 --> 18:43.708
- Now everything is on. Camera is live.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.392
- You mean the public just saw me

18:46.416 --> 18:48.476
take a honk and hit off of...

18:48.500 --> 18:49.517
- Yeah.

18:49.541 --> 18:51.351
- All right. That's good.

18:51.375 --> 18:52.416
- And message sent.

18:53.875 --> 18:54.875
- Cool.

19:37.875 --> 19:40.041
- Oh, it's the good stuff.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.934
- A statement for leaving
your security leaders

19:55.958 --> 19:58.267
for their duties this weekend.

19:58.291 --> 19:59.934
- So none of my security
know that I'm here.

19:59.958 --> 20:00.767
- Correct.

20:00.791 --> 20:01.791
- Good.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.267
My head of security. I
don't trust this guy.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.476
Should have got rid of him
when I got into office.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.601
Fire him Monday.

20:16.625 --> 20:17.625
- Okay.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.017
- So the girl she's here?

20:22.041 --> 20:23.458
- Yeah. She's in the shower.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.250
- She's good. Right?

20:27.416 --> 20:29.291
I mean she speaks English, right?

20:30.458 --> 20:31.458
- Perfectly.

20:34.750 --> 20:36.291
- You touch that, I'll cut you!

21:03.666 --> 21:05.059
All right.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.976
Let's run through it again.
- Okay.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.768
- Where am I?

21:07.792 --> 21:10.392
- [Marco] You are on a secret
diplomatic mission in Greece.

21:10.416 --> 21:11.642
- Does anybody know?

21:11.666 --> 21:12.851
- Of course, everybody.

21:12.875 --> 21:14.267
- Perfect.
- Yeah.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.892
They all think you're in Athens right now.

21:15.916 --> 21:19.309
I made up this story for the
press and your family as well.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.143
- Until?

21:20.167 --> 21:23.392
- Until you are caught
on a state of the art

21:23.416 --> 21:26.559
audio/video surveillance cameras,

21:26.583 --> 21:30.184
and having a rendezvous
with your quote, girlfriend.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.059
- My, quote, very famous girlfriend.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.267
- Very famous, yes, yes.

21:33.291 --> 21:34.102
- What's her name?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.559
- Pamela Galante.
- Pamela Galante.

21:35.583 --> 21:36.851
- She's an internet sensation.

21:36.875 --> 21:37.875
- She's an actress.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.000
And she speaks English?

21:41.833 --> 21:45.226
And she's memorized her
lines, she knows the script?

21:45.250 --> 21:46.392
Yeah.

21:46.416 --> 21:47.352
- Enrico's memorized the script.

21:47.376 --> 21:50.059
He's memorized everybody's lines.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.101
- All right.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.958
- We just gotta think positive Marco.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.684
'Cause if we can pull this off,

21:55.708 --> 21:58.184
we can win the majority with this scandal,

21:58.208 --> 21:59.226
do you know what this means?

21:59.250 --> 22:02.184
- Yeah. You probably become
the head of the party.

22:02.208 --> 22:03.726
Possibly prime minister.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.017
- Yeah, and?

22:05.041 --> 22:06.142
- And yeah, of course.

22:06.166 --> 22:09.184
That's bring massive value increases

22:09.208 --> 22:10.726
to all of your branded-

22:10.750 --> 22:12.351
- You're goddam right!
- Yeah!

22:12.375 --> 22:15.250
- That's exactly what it, what it does.

22:16.375 --> 22:18.851
Look at there's Gardenia
and Schoffnolinger,

22:18.875 --> 22:22.041
and, and, and, oh gosh, you got Joyce.

22:24.750 --> 22:25.976
I didn't know you read Ulysses?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.101
- He is one. My favorites.

22:28.125 --> 22:32.041
- Hmm. Yeah, America has
produced some fine writers.

22:33.750 --> 22:34.727
- Yep!

22:34.751 --> 22:35.892
Sir, take a look.

22:35.916 --> 22:36.916
- That her?

22:40.500 --> 22:41.500
Oh, look at that.

22:42.416 --> 22:43.541
She looks good.

22:44.416 --> 22:46.351
Oh, very nice.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.375
Yeah. She's fab.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.226
I'm never wrong about women.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.458
- Marco!

23:17.083 --> 23:17.893
- Darling!

23:17.917 --> 23:22.726
I'm so glad we could spend this
time together at long last!

23:22.750 --> 23:23.875
So relaxing.

23:25.625 --> 23:29.416
- You think that blissful peace relax you?

23:32.041 --> 23:33.309
I know you.

23:33.333 --> 23:37.851
Three days on a blissful
peace and you are just like,

23:37.875 --> 23:42.875
he, me, you be ready
to blow your brains...

23:46.583 --> 23:48.875
Out!

23:50.833 --> 23:52.392
- I know you wanted to go.

23:52.416 --> 23:53.934
I know you wanted to go to Ibiza

23:53.958 --> 23:56.517
but we'd end up on the
front page of every paper!

23:56.541 --> 23:57.791
Marco!

24:01.541 --> 24:02.976
- Unfortunately the political fact

24:03.000 --> 24:05.791
has become super big, there
is no longer an adversary.

24:07.708 --> 24:09.976
- That's the wrong line! Learn the script!

24:10.000 --> 24:12.583
That's our girl. I mean, that's our girl.

24:13.583 --> 24:15.101
We'll talk about her later.

24:15.125 --> 24:15.934
Darling!

24:15.958 --> 24:16.893
I'm gonna go slip into something

24:16.917 --> 24:18.934
a little more comfortable, darling.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.833
Like a noose.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.416
- Oh, sorry Marc. It's important.

24:28.958 --> 24:29.958
Oh yeah.

24:31.041 --> 24:32.309
Hi.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.208
I speak all in English now.

24:35.666 --> 24:36.477
Yeah.

24:36.501 --> 24:37.601
We are filming a viral scandal

24:37.625 --> 24:39.351
with American Minister of Culture.

24:39.375 --> 24:40.185
- Shh!

24:40.209 --> 24:42.351
- No you! Shh!

24:42.375 --> 24:43.666
What?

25:07.541 --> 25:09.708
Is it me or is that crazy?

25:12.041 --> 25:13.059
- What's crazy!

25:13.083 --> 25:14.851
- I have to go to visit
my mom in the clinic!

25:14.875 --> 25:15.875
- No, no you don't!

25:16.750 --> 25:18.767
- Oh, what's wrong with your mom?

25:18.791 --> 25:19.976
- It's Alzheimers!
- It's Alzheimers!

25:20.000 --> 25:21.434
- Hey!
- Hey!

25:21.458 --> 25:22.476
- [Pamela] I'm sorry.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.393
- Thank you.

25:23.417 --> 25:24.851
She says to call, I
can't keep her waiting!

25:24.875 --> 25:25.684
- No!

25:25.708 --> 25:26.684
- And we are out of cigarette.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.518
- Okay.

25:27.542 --> 25:28.892
- I have to go!
- I'll go with you.

25:28.916 --> 25:30.017
- Don't worry.
- It's okay.

25:30.041 --> 25:31.101
- No, don't bother.
- It's not a problem.

25:31.125 --> 25:31.934
- [Marco] No need.

25:31.958 --> 25:32.935
- It's my pleasure.
- No, really.

25:32.959 --> 25:34.934
No, I'm, I'm-
- It's fine.

25:34.958 --> 25:35.935
You don't need that.

25:35.959 --> 25:37.392
- Yeah, I-
- It's fine, it's fine.

25:37.416 --> 25:38.416
I'll walk you out.

25:39.583 --> 25:40.393
Who the hell did you hire?

25:40.417 --> 25:42.267
- Sir, sir. I think she's very promising.

25:42.291 --> 25:43.102
- Promising?
- Yes.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.142
- Promise, I promise to kick

25:44.166 --> 25:46.351
100% of your ass!
- No, no, no, stop!

25:46.375 --> 25:47.517
Stop, sir! Sir!

25:47.541 --> 25:49.184
- You hired an Insta model!

25:49.208 --> 25:50.500
She's not even real! What?

25:53.791 --> 25:57.101
- The comments on my Instagram profile

25:57.125 --> 25:59.767
are very real for your information.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.351
I imagine likes are something

26:01.375 --> 26:03.333
you wouldn't have to worry about?

26:05.958 --> 26:07.583
- Darling, sweetheart.

26:10.083 --> 26:10.892
- So sorry, honey.

26:10.916 --> 26:11.727
Please!

26:11.751 --> 26:12.767
- Look, the cameras are on,
please, please, I understand.

26:12.791 --> 26:16.375
We, honey! We don't wanna, listen, we.

26:17.583 --> 26:21.559
Honey, I'll bend over backwards
to make this nice for us.

26:21.583 --> 26:22.875
Can we just please?

26:24.500 --> 26:25.851
- I could do some prime time!

26:25.875 --> 26:28.559
- I know, and you will. I promise you.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.684
You will!

26:29.708 --> 26:31.934
- If I don't make a jump now when?

26:31.958 --> 26:32.958
- Yeah.

26:33.708 --> 26:34.602
Fair enough. Okay.

26:34.626 --> 26:36.476
Who do I have to call?

26:36.500 --> 26:37.809
- The director name is Mascio.

26:37.833 --> 26:38.643
- Forget the director.

26:38.667 --> 26:40.517
No one cares about the
director. Who's the boss?

26:40.541 --> 26:41.601
- Bertolami.

26:41.625 --> 26:43.392
- Bertolami. I know Bertolami.

26:43.416 --> 26:44.791
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's fine.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.726
- Boss. Look I'm, I'm sorry.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.601
- [Georgio] Bertolami? It's Martini.

27:09.625 --> 27:11.642
- Oh. Minister!
- Ciao, Guido.

27:11.666 --> 27:16.184
- Listen, my niece, Pamela Galante, is,

27:16.208 --> 27:18.392
she's got an audition, okay?

27:18.416 --> 27:21.017
And the, what's the director's name?

27:21.041 --> 27:22.142
- Machio!

27:22.166 --> 27:23.892
- With Machio.

27:23.916 --> 27:25.476
She has audition with Machio on Monday.

27:25.500 --> 27:29.351
Monday, and apparently, rumor has it,

27:29.375 --> 27:31.809
that someone else is being
considered for the role.

27:31.833 --> 27:35.476
Someone with more haters than likes, and,

27:35.500 --> 27:37.059
who, what's her name?

27:37.083 --> 27:37.893
- Nina Cavani.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.392
- Nina Cavani is being
considered and that,

27:40.416 --> 27:42.916
we can't have that on prime time, can we?

27:44.041 --> 27:44.893
So can I count on you?

27:44.917 --> 27:47.541
Can we, can we get a
meeting for, for Pamela?

27:48.583 --> 27:49.601
- [Marco] I'm sorry, minister,

27:49.625 --> 27:52.333
but we cannot accept recommendation.

27:53.500 --> 27:57.059
- Let me plant that back
in your brain again.

27:57.083 --> 28:00.458
I'd like a meeting for
Pamela Galante on Monday.

28:01.625 --> 28:03.666
- Oh, whatever, man. Let me think.

28:05.125 --> 28:10.125
What about massage treatment
at Basiliani Spa, for two?

28:10.916 --> 28:12.517
Thank you very much.

28:12.541 --> 28:13.541
- Sure.

28:14.916 --> 28:16.392
No, of course.

28:16.416 --> 28:17.892
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

28:17.916 --> 28:18.916
- You're so kind.

28:23.166 --> 28:24.666
- Ciao. Good bye.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.083
- You do the guy a favor
and he's trying to screw ya.

28:33.125 --> 28:34.601
- It all revolves around sex.

28:34.625 --> 28:38.059
- Yeah, except sex. Sex
revolves around power.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.559
Which reminds me.

28:39.583 --> 28:43.500
We are going to power down our phones.

29:42.666 --> 29:44.267
Don't move.

29:44.291 --> 29:45.291
I'll be right back.

31:14.500 --> 31:18.434
All right. Let's, let's try
the lines again from the top.

31:18.458 --> 31:20.351
Okay?
- Okay.

31:20.375 --> 31:23.642
- All right, so I'm gonna
say, "Look what I brought you.

31:23.666 --> 31:25.642
I brought you some champagne.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.458
- Oh, let me take a picture.

31:28.416 --> 31:31.351
Oh, bubbles get us some likes.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.666
Wait, I need a stro."

31:34.833 --> 31:35.833
- Straw.
- Stro.

31:36.958 --> 31:37.958
- Stro.

31:39.541 --> 31:44.541
And I say, "Let, no drink it like this!

31:44.791 --> 31:45.809
- Oh, it's cold.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.559
You are getting me wet all over.

31:47.583 --> 31:50.392
- Ooh. Talk about likes.

31:50.416 --> 31:51.416
- Oh yes!

31:52.916 --> 31:54.851
- You like that?

31:54.875 --> 31:59.875
- Oh, give me luxury and
I renounce necessities."

32:01.416 --> 32:02.684
Necessities?

32:02.708 --> 32:04.517
- Exactly. Just like that, yeah.

32:04.541 --> 32:05.351
- Okay.

32:05.375 --> 32:06.375
- No, from the top.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.517
- Freeze your hands!

32:10.541 --> 32:12.059
You, your hands!

32:12.083 --> 32:13.142
- What are you? What are you doing?

32:13.166 --> 32:15.601
Okay. You're you're early.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.809
- It's not now?

32:16.833 --> 32:17.934
- No, it's not now.

32:17.958 --> 32:19.892
- No, please! Don't shit!

32:19.916 --> 32:21.726
- D-Don't?
- Shoot!

32:21.750 --> 32:23.142
- That's early too. Okay?

32:23.166 --> 32:26.267
That's not now. Don't shit or shoot.

32:26.291 --> 32:28.559
That's not now. And that's not here.

32:28.583 --> 32:31.934
Neither of those things are
here. They're in the other room.

32:31.958 --> 32:34.059
Both of those lines are supposed
to happen in the other room

32:34.083 --> 32:36.184
where there are cameras, see,
there are no cameras here.

32:36.208 --> 32:39.392
So if you can just wait-
- How do I look?

32:39.416 --> 32:40.726
- You look beautiful.
- Me?

32:40.750 --> 32:42.833
No, not would you get the outta here?

32:46.083 --> 32:48.708
All right. That was, that was good.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.241
Are you gonna do it like that?

33:18.708 --> 33:20.375
Oh my God! You said.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.541
Oh, God! Not the video.

33:31.541 --> 33:33.625
Oh, my God. It's horrible.

33:36.166 --> 33:37.416
- You! You now.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.666
Watch my pig face.

33:44.291 --> 33:45.102
- Look.

33:45.126 --> 33:46.208
- I know you!

33:48.083 --> 33:48.893
- All right.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.000
- I know you.

33:52.125 --> 33:54.416
I see you in prison.

33:56.291 --> 33:57.708
You're beautiful.

33:58.625 --> 34:00.833
I do much with you in my mind!

34:03.208 --> 34:08.208
I see you are, Squizzando.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.851
- You saw me, Squizzando?

34:10.875 --> 34:15.267
- Yes! You, you're very, very good.

34:15.291 --> 34:18.267
I love on Squizzando when
you, you move your body,

34:18.291 --> 34:19.625
and-
- Dance now!

34:20.958 --> 34:22.017
- Do the dance now!

34:22.041 --> 34:24.458
- No. Don't dance now.

34:25.416 --> 34:26.601
Let's, so help me, if you do.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.767
You don't, okay, that's not.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.267
- Oh.

34:30.291 --> 34:33.351
You are oh, good.
- Why don't you sit down?

34:33.375 --> 34:34.684
Please sit down.

34:34.708 --> 34:35.851
Please sit down.

34:35.875 --> 34:37.851
- Whoa, sit, sit down!

34:37.875 --> 34:39.541
- Thank you. Thanks.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.000
- You!

34:43.916 --> 34:44.727
Your name!

34:44.751 --> 34:45.809
- Name? I'm Giorgio.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.892
Giorgio Martini.

34:46.916 --> 34:49.392
- Yes. He was on TV often?

34:49.416 --> 34:51.017
- Yes.

34:51.041 --> 34:54.309
That. I'll never want you with no clothes!

34:54.333 --> 34:55.143
All right?

34:55.167 --> 34:56.500
- Yeah. I can see that.

34:57.833 --> 34:58.833
- You are who?

35:00.000 --> 35:01.500
- Giorgio Martini.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.250
- You are, who?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.767
- George. Giorgio Martini!

35:07.791 --> 35:09.476
I said that.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.767
- You!
- I don't know

35:10.791 --> 35:11.601
what you're saying.

35:11.625 --> 35:12.560
What are you saying?
- Jesus!

35:12.584 --> 35:14.500
Okay? What is your job?

35:15.750 --> 35:17.392
- Do, my, minister
- What!

35:17.416 --> 35:19.851
- I'm the Minister of Culture

35:19.875 --> 35:22.708
and my bodyguards will be here any minute.

35:23.625 --> 35:24.833
- What are you saying?

35:25.791 --> 35:27.851
You are important man?

35:27.875 --> 35:28.852
- That's right. What?

35:28.876 --> 35:31.101
Don't you speak Italian?

35:31.125 --> 35:33.976
My men'll be here. So you
might as well give yourself up.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.476
- You?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.434
- Yeah.

35:36.458 --> 35:37.351
- No!

35:37.375 --> 35:38.227
- Yes.

35:38.251 --> 35:39.392
- No!

35:39.416 --> 35:40.227
- Yes.

35:40.251 --> 35:41.767
Would, would you tell him please what.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.375
- He think he's a very,
very important person.

35:46.041 --> 35:46.893
(laughs)
- Thank you.

35:46.917 --> 35:49.517
- How much this country make me laugh.

35:49.541 --> 35:54.184
In Italy, anyone can
become whatever they want!

35:54.208 --> 35:56.351
You are the Minister.

35:56.375 --> 35:59.583
- What are you saying? Why
don't you stick to the script?

36:02.166 --> 36:02.977
Listen.

36:03.001 --> 36:04.684
- My men will be here.

36:04.708 --> 36:08.059
All right. Give yourself up or so help me.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.583
I'll take you down.

36:12.750 --> 36:17.309
- You say, you say men arrive, huh?

36:17.333 --> 36:19.642
But who believes you? Huh?

36:19.666 --> 36:21.101
You a politician.

36:21.125 --> 36:23.267
You liar. Every breath you take.

36:23.291 --> 36:25.267
- That's not-
- Look at my pig face.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.434
- Why isn't he-
- Look at my pig face!

36:27.458 --> 36:30.892
Okay. You wear a mask every day.

36:30.916 --> 36:32.976
No difference between you and me.

36:33.000 --> 36:36.142
- That's good.
- Oh no, no, I no need.

36:36.166 --> 36:38.059
I no need mask.
- What, what are you doing?

36:38.083 --> 36:40.059
- No, I no need mask!

36:40.083 --> 36:40.892
(country rock music)
- The fuck are you doing?

36:40.916 --> 36:41.893
- You are a pig.

36:41.917 --> 36:43.892
No, okay?
- That's insane!

36:43.916 --> 36:45.833
- You, you are the pig.

36:47.541 --> 36:51.208
Now, I open your eyes.

36:57.625 --> 36:59.184
- You doing?

36:59.208 --> 37:00.791
What are you doing?

37:03.750 --> 37:05.684
What are you doing?

37:05.708 --> 37:06.976
What are you doing?

37:07.000 --> 37:08.809
- You can see everything.

37:08.833 --> 37:12.101
Not with your eyes, but with your ride.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.767
Feast your eyes!
- What, are you!

37:14.791 --> 37:16.375
What are you doing?

37:17.708 --> 37:18.708
You! Dance!

37:39.791 --> 37:41.851
- He's very good.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.000
Where did you find him?

37:44.000 --> 37:46.041
- He used to work for me.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.059
- It's your production
value. How fantastic.

37:53.083 --> 37:56.083
Please, please, please call me anytime.

37:57.125 --> 38:00.583
- This guy's a maniac. He's
gonna blow everything up.

38:02.625 --> 38:05.642
- This isn't in the script?

38:05.666 --> 38:08.000
- No Squizzando, this isn't the script.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.809
All right. We gotta stay rational.

38:10.833 --> 38:12.059
We're gonna take a deep breath,

38:12.083 --> 38:14.476
'cause he can come in
here any minute, okay?

38:14.500 --> 38:16.184
Just gotta keep our heads.

38:16.208 --> 38:17.791
We just gotta stay calm.

38:20.208 --> 38:21.226
- Help! Help!

38:21.250 --> 38:22.060
Yeah, we can do that.

38:22.084 --> 38:23.404
We can do that too. Just do that.

38:46.166 --> 38:47.684
- What the fuck is going on?

38:47.708 --> 38:48.643
- Hey. Hi.

38:48.667 --> 38:49.684
Did you like our explosion?

38:49.708 --> 38:50.708
- I heard it.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.227
- Let's see.

38:52.251 --> 38:54.017
There's been some changes to the script,

38:54.041 --> 38:56.976
Enrico dropped the Romanian accent and,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.767
and he no longer wants
to work with the mask.

38:59.791 --> 39:02.434
Two very strong choices, I know.

39:02.458 --> 39:05.726
Which means he either doesn't
mind going back to prison,

39:05.750 --> 39:08.892
or he wants to kill himself
in front of the world.

39:08.916 --> 39:11.375
Not before killing us first.

39:12.291 --> 39:14.351
Which reminds me. The gun?

39:14.375 --> 39:15.310
It's loaded.

39:15.334 --> 39:16.601
- Loaded?
- Yeah.

39:16.625 --> 39:18.101
Did you get your cigarettes?

39:18.125 --> 39:19.458
- Yeah.
- Can I have one?

39:20.791 --> 39:21.791
How are we doing?

39:28.291 --> 39:29.333
- Look, no-

39:35.208 --> 39:36.916
- Incoming. Here he is.

39:47.541 --> 39:48.625
- Relax, huh?

39:50.041 --> 39:51.541
There's nowhere to go.

39:52.708 --> 39:54.434
Many bombs outside.

39:54.458 --> 39:56.267
I have control.

39:56.291 --> 39:59.041
- I'm dead before I create my foundation.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.809
- What is it for, very noble.?

40:04.833 --> 40:06.416
- To teach girl to code.

40:07.458 --> 40:08.458
- Very noble.

40:10.625 --> 40:11.435
Who. are you?

40:11.459 --> 40:12.976
- I'm his personal assistant.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.916
- Huh? I feel bad for you.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.833
You want the gun, huh?

40:21.500 --> 40:22.833
I see you.

40:24.333 --> 40:25.500
- He keeps saying that.

40:26.541 --> 40:28.434
- Why is he doing this?

40:28.458 --> 40:30.726
- What? Exiting up stage to the kitchen?

40:30.750 --> 40:32.101
I have no idea.

40:32.125 --> 40:34.559
He has been off script all night.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.083
- [Enrico] And I hear you!

40:37.791 --> 40:39.267
- Sir.

40:39.291 --> 40:41.809
I didn't wanna say anything
but how did it happen?

40:41.833 --> 40:42.833
- Bad casting.

40:45.125 --> 40:47.351
- And now what, we're gonna do?

40:47.375 --> 40:50.851
- You're gonna be a hero
because I only have one life.

40:50.875 --> 40:52.291
So you better figure it out.

41:01.958 --> 41:03.601
- We have two lives.

41:03.625 --> 41:06.875
The second begins when we
realize we have only one.

41:08.791 --> 41:10.750
I think is it in your carrier?

41:12.083 --> 41:13.434
- Pearls on swine?

41:13.458 --> 41:15.976
- Well, how can you eat this shit?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.684
- Well if you miss
prison food, that badly,

41:17.708 --> 41:19.601
there are easier ways my friend.

41:19.625 --> 41:22.625
- Five years in prison. It's a long time.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.250
You imagine five years?

41:29.791 --> 41:33.059
- Listen. Our party has
fought hard for prison reform.

41:33.083 --> 41:34.791
We're the party for prisoners.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.875
- Do you know what they
do? First thing in prison?

41:42.833 --> 41:44.517
- No, I'm...

41:44.541 --> 41:45.351
- No idea.

41:45.375 --> 41:46.185
- No idea.

41:46.209 --> 41:50.208
- If he just go out of prison,
he's broke. Offer him cash.

41:51.041 --> 41:53.601
- You're right. It's, I,
you're absolutely right.

41:53.625 --> 41:55.309
You've been, five years is a long time

41:55.333 --> 41:57.476
and you probably do need some money.

41:57.500 --> 42:01.184
So in a couple hours I
could get you 10,000 euros.

42:01.208 --> 42:04.851
- What's the first thing
they do in prison, you know?

42:04.875 --> 42:06.125
- Don't be cheap. More.

42:07.083 --> 42:09.559
- 20,000. You want 20,000.

42:09.583 --> 42:11.059
You're good for 10,000. Right?

42:11.083 --> 42:13.267
20,000 euros. How does that sound?

42:13.291 --> 42:15.976
- First thing when you arrive.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.809
- Oh, you know, I don't know.

42:17.833 --> 42:18.851
Help me out here, Marco.

42:18.875 --> 42:19.934
Any ideas?

42:19.958 --> 42:20.958
- None, sir.

42:21.791 --> 42:23.625
I have a perfect record, so.

42:24.708 --> 42:25.750
- No idea, huh?
- No idea.

42:27.708 --> 42:28.791
- No idea.

42:31.500 --> 42:34.976
First thing. Be baptized.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.041
- Baptized.

42:37.500 --> 42:40.726
Well, I know they have
a chapel, don't they?

42:40.750 --> 42:43.017
- It's not entirely clear.

42:43.041 --> 42:48.000
So if you can tell us exactly
what this involves in details.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.059
- Hey, don't be stupid.

42:51.083 --> 42:53.166
Everyone knows what's happening in prison.

42:54.250 --> 42:55.767
- Yes.
(soft music)

42:55.791 --> 42:58.892
You decide who takes, who gives?

42:58.916 --> 43:01.809
- Of course I have heard of this.

43:01.833 --> 43:05.250
- Now you too decide who takes, who gives?

43:06.875 --> 43:07.875
- I'm sorry?

43:09.625 --> 43:11.333
- You like your secretary?

43:13.125 --> 43:15.101
- Let me assure you, sir.

43:15.125 --> 43:19.059
I don't have that level
of security clearance.

43:19.083 --> 43:20.559
- All right. Look.

43:20.583 --> 43:23.601
That's quite enough, Max, Katie, Laine.

43:23.625 --> 43:27.059
Firstly, I'm hetero,
okay? And I'm married.

43:27.083 --> 43:30.833
Okay. And I've never cheated on my wife.

43:32.166 --> 43:32.977
Come on, Marco.

43:33.001 --> 43:34.726
Help me out here. Say something would you?

43:34.750 --> 43:37.041
- And that something will be what sir?

43:38.833 --> 43:39.685
- You're secretary?

43:39.709 --> 43:41.976
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.142
And boss?
- Yes.

43:43.166 --> 43:44.309
- Yes.
- Yes.

43:44.333 --> 43:45.976
- Now,
- Now?

43:46.000 --> 43:47.000
- Fuck him!

43:49.791 --> 43:51.583
And now I'm going to have

43:53.833 --> 43:57.250
an intelligent conversation
with this woman.

43:59.666 --> 44:01.809
Don't worry. I don't touch you.

44:01.833 --> 44:04.791
I just want you away from this pig.

44:10.083 --> 44:11.142
Oh!

44:11.166 --> 44:11.977
I'm sorry.

44:12.001 --> 44:16.226
I mean, she nice! I like!

44:16.250 --> 44:20.416
Boobs like mother. (grunts) Pig man!

44:26.041 --> 44:27.958
- Well, at least that was in the script.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.458
- Sure.
- Was she smiling?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.809
- Don't be scared.

44:47.833 --> 44:49.750
This is the right path.

45:33.541 --> 45:36.250
- He's planted bombs all around the house.

45:39.208 --> 45:42.101
Even if we could grab her
without you getting shot,

45:42.125 --> 45:43.125
where would we go?

45:44.500 --> 45:48.958
- I wouldn't want my flesh
would slowing us down, sir.

45:51.083 --> 45:54.226
- Unless of course, you
know, you swept for mines,

45:54.250 --> 45:57.642
but that would just
take too long with your-

45:57.666 --> 45:59.809
- With my gunshot, sir.
- With your gunshot wound.

45:59.833 --> 46:00.833
Exactly.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.392
No, although I'll appreciate it

46:04.416 --> 46:07.267
and your sacrifice would be remembered.

46:07.291 --> 46:09.458
I, I do not advise this.

46:11.583 --> 46:12.393
I'm sorry, man.

46:12.417 --> 46:15.125
I just, I can't sign off on this Marco.

46:17.666 --> 46:19.000
- I see.

47:12.916 --> 47:14.333
- I hope she's alright.

47:17.375 --> 47:18.500
Really something, huh?

47:20.250 --> 47:23.892
- Well, I don't really know, sir.

47:23.916 --> 47:28.291
I'm not very experienced with female form.

47:30.583 --> 47:31.851
- What?

47:31.875 --> 47:33.726
- Yeah. I'm gay.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.375
It's true.

47:39.333 --> 47:42.875
- (chuckles) You're not
gay. You're engaged.

47:44.291 --> 47:46.726
- I am engaged, but, and I love them.

47:46.750 --> 47:48.625
I just never said he was a man.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.041
- Well, first, (mumbles).

47:54.250 --> 47:55.250
Okay.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.017
Congratulations.

47:59.041 --> 48:01.476
- Thank you. I thought you would fire me.

48:01.500 --> 48:04.226
- No, no. Why would I do that?

48:04.250 --> 48:08.267
- Because you would have a gay secretary?

48:08.291 --> 48:09.102
- No!

48:09.126 --> 48:12.601
I mean, look, I mean, I
hire male secretaries,

48:12.625 --> 48:16.059
'cause I want to avoid
sexual harassment suits.

48:16.083 --> 48:19.517
I mean and this is certainly
a gay change, game changer!

48:19.541 --> 48:23.142
But I've, you know, your
work's always been exceptional,

48:23.166 --> 48:25.434
except this, of course,
this is a shit show,

48:25.458 --> 48:29.142
but, I wouldn't not keep you on because,

48:29.166 --> 48:32.892
now I kind of have to keep you, don't I?

48:32.916 --> 48:34.059
- Otherwise I can sue you?

48:34.083 --> 48:35.517
- Yeah.

48:35.541 --> 48:36.477
- I won't, sir.

48:36.501 --> 48:39.184
- That's not my leg
touching you, by the way.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.208
- No.

49:42.416 --> 49:43.416
Bertolami.

49:47.083 --> 49:48.083
Bertolami.

49:56.666 --> 49:58.517
- So how does it work in the holidays?

49:58.541 --> 50:01.726
Like, do you go visit
his parents or does he,

50:01.750 --> 50:04.017
does he, does he visit yours?

50:04.041 --> 50:05.142
- Well, it depends.

50:05.166 --> 50:07.226
It's Christmas at mine.

50:07.250 --> 50:08.250
Easter at his.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.601
Or vice versa.

50:10.625 --> 50:11.625
- Very democratic.

50:17.416 --> 50:18.851
- [Enrico] It's me!

50:18.875 --> 50:20.934
- Come on now, Enrico!

50:20.958 --> 50:23.392
Okay. Look what?

50:23.416 --> 50:25.017
How can I help you, man?

50:25.041 --> 50:27.625
- Huh? The ways you helped her.

50:29.458 --> 50:30.458
- What?

50:33.000 --> 50:35.916
- You called Bertolami, didn't you?

50:38.166 --> 50:40.083
Please, call him again.

50:42.791 --> 50:46.333
Wasn't it the last call the minister made?

50:47.375 --> 50:49.291
- You're a little shit.

50:51.708 --> 50:53.583
- Call him. Go ahead.

50:55.208 --> 50:56.208
- This helps no one.

50:58.666 --> 51:02.267
(phone rings)
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

51:02.291 --> 51:03.458
It's your phone?

51:06.208 --> 51:08.601
Just trying to help.

51:08.625 --> 51:11.125
And you? What you have to say?

51:12.166 --> 51:16.083
She calls Bertolami and
it's you on the other end?

51:18.666 --> 51:19.892
- Typical.

51:19.916 --> 51:22.625
- Oscar winning performance, Martini.

51:23.541 --> 51:24.833
- In the role of the man.

51:33.875 --> 51:34.976
- What did she just say?

51:35.000 --> 51:36.976
- Oh, a compliment, sir.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.250
- Wasn't I your most trusted man?

51:41.875 --> 51:43.184
- Yeah.

51:43.208 --> 51:44.309
Yeah. You were.

51:44.333 --> 51:45.458
I trusted you.

51:46.750 --> 51:49.267
- And you're turning your back on me.

51:49.291 --> 51:50.541
- That was the trial.

51:51.458 --> 51:52.476
And now we can make it right.

51:52.500 --> 51:54.184
We can make it right right now.

51:54.208 --> 51:55.208
- Hmm.

51:55.958 --> 51:57.976
What about Sylvia?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.916
- What about Sylvia?
Leave my wife out of this.

52:01.875 --> 52:05.684
- You always told me that
I was part of the family,

52:05.708 --> 52:07.458
but I, I never met her.

52:08.708 --> 52:10.291
- I never met her either.

52:11.458 --> 52:13.541
- And trust me, you never will.

52:15.083 --> 52:18.517
What do you think? Shall we call her?

52:18.541 --> 52:20.351
- She has nothing to do with this.

52:20.375 --> 52:23.684
Now let's talk cash,
'cause clearly that's what-

52:23.708 --> 52:27.791
- You think cash can solve your problems?

52:28.666 --> 52:30.601
You really are a pig.

52:30.625 --> 52:33.601
- The classes between the classes exist,

52:33.625 --> 52:36.101
especially where classes are absent.

52:36.125 --> 52:38.434
- All right, enough Confucius.

52:38.458 --> 52:42.559
Now, listen, we there's nothing
to be embarrassed by here.

52:42.583 --> 52:43.583
- Okay?

52:47.250 --> 52:48.559
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

52:48.583 --> 52:49.892
- Repent!

52:49.916 --> 52:51.416
- What am I, Fredo?
- Repent!

52:52.875 --> 52:54.142
- Just, I mean, come on man!

52:54.166 --> 52:55.684
You're just your little,
you're trying my patience.

52:55.708 --> 52:58.333
- Patience is everything in life.

53:00.458 --> 53:04.434
You know? Do you know
much patience I've had?

53:04.458 --> 53:05.541
- Excuse me?

53:06.625 --> 53:08.791
What exactly you were in prison for?

53:09.791 --> 53:11.666
- Falsifying financial records.

53:13.625 --> 53:15.500
- The truth will come out.

53:21.583 --> 53:26.476
You're going to love what I
have on this little device.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.500
- What is that?

53:28.750 --> 53:30.791
- It's a screenplay for my film.

53:31.791 --> 53:32.602
- Jesus.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.875
Did you write it or did you steal it?

53:36.083 --> 53:37.625
- I have a little role for you.

53:40.083 --> 53:42.226
- Yeah. Careful, honey.

53:42.250 --> 53:45.184
No matter what he says,
never sleep with a writer.

53:45.208 --> 53:47.041
- I don't have to sleep with anybody.

53:49.250 --> 53:50.250
- Fair enough.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.125
- My role is perfect for you.

53:54.250 --> 53:55.666
He is a real prick.

53:56.500 --> 53:58.583
And you, feel free to improvise.

53:59.500 --> 54:00.559
- Thank you.

54:00.583 --> 54:01.560
- Careful what you wish for.

54:01.584 --> 54:05.517
He's a very complex and
multifaceted personality.

54:05.541 --> 54:10.291
- Hmm. Now, we can have a little talk.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.726
Come on.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.017
Come on, guys.

54:14.041 --> 54:15.226
- Go ahead.

54:15.250 --> 54:17.101
Yeah, go ahead.

54:17.125 --> 54:18.125
- Please.

54:44.791 --> 54:49.416
Now, we are going to play a little game.

54:50.625 --> 54:52.625
Come on, everyone on the sofa.

55:04.416 --> 55:05.517
- I thought he missed those.

55:05.541 --> 55:09.476
- I think they heard it in Otranto.

55:09.500 --> 55:14.500
- Now, we are going to play
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

55:16.458 --> 55:18.476
- Eeny, meeny, miny,
moe was in your script?

55:18.500 --> 55:19.393
- Yeah.

55:19.417 --> 55:22.934
We're not doing the Eeny,
meeny, miny, moe scene anymore.

55:22.958 --> 55:26.208
- Oh yes, we are doing
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.

55:27.250 --> 55:30.125
- I love Eeny, meeny, miny,
moe. It's my favorite to sing.

55:33.916 --> 55:34.976
- Do you have the fake finger?

55:35.000 --> 55:36.767
- I think he's serious.

55:36.791 --> 55:38.101
- Eeny-meeny...

55:38.125 --> 55:39.976
- Okay. What do you want?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.208
- No. (screams)

55:43.375 --> 55:45.976
- I want you to confess.

55:46.000 --> 55:47.642
- To confess what?

55:47.666 --> 55:49.333
- That all was bullshit!

55:51.125 --> 55:53.351
Catch a tiger by the toe.

55:53.375 --> 55:54.375
- Which part?

55:56.375 --> 55:59.351
- If he hollers let him, go.

55:59.375 --> 56:03.351
This lie you are telling
the public with this farce.

56:03.375 --> 56:04.375
Eeny,

56:05.500 --> 56:06.393
meeny,

56:06.417 --> 56:08.375
- Okay.
- Miny,

56:16.750 --> 56:18.791
- What? All right, look!

56:19.958 --> 56:22.267
All right, it was me, it was me! Me all!

56:22.291 --> 56:23.517
Okay, I did it! It was me. Io!

56:23.541 --> 56:26.017
It was all bullshit, okay?

56:26.041 --> 56:29.809
And we were going to leak to the media,

56:29.833 --> 56:34.392
showing me in a affair with a
woman I had never met before.

56:34.416 --> 56:35.666
Lovely actress.

56:36.916 --> 56:38.976
And you, my friend,

56:39.000 --> 56:44.000
were going to rob us posed as an immigrant

56:44.583 --> 56:48.726
Romanian, I think with a
very believable accent.

56:48.750 --> 56:51.976
And I was going to save
the day and prove heroic

56:52.000 --> 56:55.392
in the eyes of the nationalist voters.

56:55.416 --> 56:56.476
Happy?

56:56.500 --> 57:00.351
- So ironic. Coming from an immigrant.

57:00.375 --> 57:01.375
- You took the job.

57:02.500 --> 57:03.875
- Now is the hypocrisy.

57:05.916 --> 57:10.916
Let's examine the full
extent of your treachery.

57:16.041 --> 57:19.267
- You'll never work in
this province again.

57:19.291 --> 57:20.458
- Can I take my finger?

57:21.500 --> 57:22.500
- Yes.

57:36.666 --> 57:38.601
- You two stay here.

57:38.625 --> 57:42.041
Giorgio and I are going to
have a nice private chat.

57:43.541 --> 57:45.333
- Why don't you use the relax room?

57:47.958 --> 57:50.017
- That's a very good
idea. The, the relax room.

57:50.041 --> 57:53.392
Yes, is a, is a perfect
place for a private chat.

57:53.416 --> 57:56.392
It's very private and, and very

57:56.416 --> 57:58.375
- Relaxing.
- Relaxing, yes.

57:59.916 --> 58:04.142
- Sounds like the perfect place
for the tooth to come out.

58:04.166 --> 58:06.059
- The, for the tooth to come out?

58:06.083 --> 58:07.517
- The tooth!

58:07.541 --> 58:08.767
- Look, the man, we just did the finger.

58:08.791 --> 58:10.142
I don't know if we can.

58:10.166 --> 58:11.291
- I don't have a tooth.

58:12.250 --> 58:13.250
- Okay.

58:16.166 --> 58:17.267
- You said tooth.
- I said truth,

58:17.291 --> 58:20.916
sounds like tooth.

59:02.125 --> 59:05.125
- I never lost one of
your social engagements.

59:08.000 --> 59:12.309
Such parties to masquerade callers.

59:12.333 --> 59:15.083
Invitation all the TV shows.

59:16.416 --> 59:18.642
And what?

59:18.666 --> 59:19.833
A bullshitter.

59:20.708 --> 59:23.083
- That was the job description. Yeah.

59:25.166 --> 59:25.977
Get on with it. Would you?

59:26.001 --> 59:27.809
What is your, what's the play?

59:27.833 --> 59:28.875
What's your play man?

59:30.250 --> 59:34.017
I'm getting high in here. Okay?

59:34.041 --> 59:35.333
- You mean my screenplay?

59:37.625 --> 59:38.892
- [Georgio] Seriously?

59:38.916 --> 59:39.726
- Yes.

59:39.750 --> 59:40.727
- Fuck, this is it?

59:40.751 --> 59:42.750
- Yes, this is it.
- Okay, let's do it.

59:45.666 --> 59:48.208
- Wait, the role of Giorgio?

59:49.833 --> 59:51.416
And I read role of-

59:52.250 --> 59:53.809
- Enrico?
- Yes.

59:53.833 --> 59:54.643
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

59:54.667 --> 59:56.101
- We're doing this now.

59:56.125 --> 1:00:01.125
- Don't gimme me that sad face, Giorgio.

1:00:04.458 --> 1:00:06.434
You remind me of when I was in prison.

1:00:06.458 --> 1:00:08.976
- That's your line. All right.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:09.810
Okay.
- I want to cry,

1:00:09.834 --> 1:00:11.916
but I sucked it up every single day.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:14.601
- I'm sorry!
(tense music)

1:00:14.625 --> 1:00:16.142
- Finally!

1:00:16.166 --> 1:00:21.166
Now Minister Martini will
explain why I, Enrico Altieri,

1:00:21.625 --> 1:00:24.267
had to do five years in prison.

1:00:24.291 --> 1:00:27.184
- I don't un, I don't understand
what you're trying to do.

1:00:27.208 --> 1:00:28.851
We all make mistakes.

1:00:28.875 --> 1:00:30.684
- Tell me why I did the time!

1:00:30.708 --> 1:00:34.392
- Because you wanted to do it your way.

1:00:34.416 --> 1:00:36.934
- This is what you told the court.

1:00:36.958 --> 1:00:38.934
- I'm sure there must
have been another episode

1:00:38.958 --> 1:00:41.642
that I missed, one that I didn't know of?

1:00:41.666 --> 1:00:43.791
Perhaps a few?
- That's enough!

1:00:47.833 --> 1:00:49.934
- No. Line says I shout here.

1:00:49.958 --> 1:00:52.517
- Shout.
- No, no!

1:00:52.541 --> 1:00:56.976
- So, talk! Talk fat fuck!

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000
What was I, what did I do?

1:01:00.875 --> 1:01:04.267
- You, you played tennis
and you know what?

1:01:04.291 --> 1:01:05.476
You know what?

1:01:05.500 --> 1:01:06.851
You had talent.

1:01:06.875 --> 1:01:10.392
When you were 20, you
could have been a champion,

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:13.726
but it takes more than
talent to be the best.

1:01:13.750 --> 1:01:16.958
It takes heart, and height.

1:01:19.041 --> 1:01:20.166
And that you never had.

1:01:37.291 --> 1:01:38.291
- Okay.

1:01:44.416 --> 1:01:45.393
- And so the years went by

1:01:45.417 --> 1:01:47.726
and you became just
another washed up athlete,

1:01:47.750 --> 1:01:49.934
giving bored housewives lessons

1:01:49.958 --> 1:01:51.750
and fucking them on the side.

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:55.059
And to make some extra money,

1:01:55.083 --> 1:01:58.875
you started putting the fix on matches.

1:02:01.666 --> 1:02:04.458
You were just a common,
low life piece of shit,

1:02:06.458 --> 1:02:08.500
until I came along and saved your ass.

1:02:13.791 --> 1:02:15.250
- You're right.

1:02:18.666 --> 1:02:22.541
You saved me, if you want to call it that.

1:02:25.625 --> 1:02:29.083
You brought me in your so-called family

1:02:31.416 --> 1:02:34.476
and you made me an important man.

1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:35.500
Yes.

1:02:38.791 --> 1:02:40.333
But there was a price for that.

1:02:42.291 --> 1:02:43.291
Yes!

1:02:44.333 --> 1:02:47.166
I, covered your eyes, and forget.

1:02:50.541 --> 1:02:55.541
I burned my soul and I lost
five years rotting in prison.

1:03:13.625 --> 1:03:18.500
And now, I am a man with no
life, no money, no family!

1:03:26.041 --> 1:03:30.583
All these years being your right-hand man!

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:37.226
And, what do I have to show for it?

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:40.726
Obviously the 400 euros a month

1:03:40.750 --> 1:03:42.125
that you drop into my account.

1:03:46.083 --> 1:03:47.083
So you...

1:03:49.708 --> 1:03:53.184
So you can feel good about,
so you can feel good,

1:03:53.208 --> 1:03:57.041
so you can wash the feet
of your wife and your son!

1:03:59.833 --> 1:04:01.083
Fuck you!

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:30.625
There's only the two of us.

1:04:36.583 --> 1:04:38.601
No one can hear you.

1:04:38.625 --> 1:04:41.166
- It's not really them I'm
worried about, you know?

1:04:42.750 --> 1:04:43.750
- What made it.

1:04:46.208 --> 1:04:50.375
You cheated me. You screwed me over.

1:04:51.875 --> 1:04:56.750
And I took it and I kept
quiet for some change.

1:04:59.166 --> 1:05:04.166
You raised me, your
chief financial officer,

1:05:05.833 --> 1:05:08.666
thrown out like a piece of garbage!

1:05:09.750 --> 1:05:11.059
Who set me up? Who?

1:05:11.083 --> 1:05:15.142
- No one, no one set you up!

1:05:15.166 --> 1:05:17.017
We agreed.

1:05:17.041 --> 1:05:18.125
We agreed.

1:05:18.958 --> 1:05:20.309
It was graft.

1:05:20.333 --> 1:05:21.476
Okay, it was graft.

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:26.375
You signed, okay. You
signed, you go to jail.

1:05:27.541 --> 1:05:28.726
We agreed.

1:05:28.750 --> 1:05:33.750
We, you, five months, five
months is all, not five years!

1:05:34.625 --> 1:05:37.750
You made it five years,
you fucking lunatic!

1:05:41.416 --> 1:05:43.559
Like anger management.
That's all I can recommend.

1:05:43.583 --> 1:05:44.583
I'm sorry.

1:05:45.458 --> 1:05:47.976
This is why your wife left you. Okay.

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.059
This is why, not my fault!

1:05:50.083 --> 1:05:52.476
So take some fucking responsibility

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:54.416
for once in your god damn life.

1:05:55.833 --> 1:05:57.291
Jesus Christ.

1:05:58.125 --> 1:05:59.125
It's never you.

1:06:00.666 --> 1:06:03.351
If I would've said Enrico,
go jump in front of a train,

1:06:03.375 --> 1:06:04.625
would you do it?
- Si!

1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:09.333
Yes!

1:06:43.291 --> 1:06:46.583
- Going into politics
against someone is easy.

1:06:48.250 --> 1:06:49.726
Just like in business, I suppose.

1:06:49.750 --> 1:06:51.583
And I've done that many times,

1:06:53.208 --> 1:06:56.833
but going into politics
for an ideal, for a belief,

1:06:57.750 --> 1:06:59.458
that's where the true beauty lies.

1:07:00.875 --> 1:07:02.666
The world needs more of that beauty.

1:07:04.833 --> 1:07:06.291
Like in business, I imagine.

1:07:07.250 --> 1:07:08.833
Be proud of that kind of beauty.

1:07:10.375 --> 1:07:13.583
Go into politics for your
children, for your future.

1:07:15.458 --> 1:07:19.934
Go forward with a brave
heart for the less fortunate,

1:07:19.958 --> 1:07:23.041
not for the pleasure of
your corporate masters.

1:07:24.250 --> 1:07:27.267
- This video of your alleged
affair and kidnapping

1:07:27.291 --> 1:07:29.392
has been all over the world.

1:07:29.416 --> 1:07:31.517
It's been viewed by millions.

1:07:31.541 --> 1:07:34.208
Honestly, it's a little puzzling.

1:07:35.250 --> 1:07:38.083
More so because of the fact
that you, Minister Martini,

1:07:39.166 --> 1:07:40.750
admittedly staged at all

1:07:41.791 --> 1:07:43.351
to fool the Italian voting public,

1:07:43.375 --> 1:07:47.000
and leaked and added
surveillance tape yourself

1:07:48.875 --> 1:07:50.976
of your admission to the fact.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:51.893
- Yes, I did.

1:07:51.917 --> 1:07:55.851
- Then agreed to drop all
charges against your kidnapper,

1:07:55.875 --> 1:07:57.458
an ex-business associate,

1:07:58.458 --> 1:08:01.642
even though it appears
he meant to actually

1:08:01.666 --> 1:08:03.333
to cause you harm in the end.

1:08:04.208 --> 1:08:06.392
- Look, if you wanna be
happy for one moment,

1:08:06.416 --> 1:08:07.809
then you avenge yourself.

1:08:07.833 --> 1:08:12.416
But if you wanna be happy for
a lifetime, then you forgive.

1:08:15.333 --> 1:08:17.166
Look, I didn't press charges because,

1:08:18.166 --> 1:08:23.166
because as crazy as it
sounds, he, he opened my eyes.

1:08:23.666 --> 1:08:24.477
They all did.

1:08:24.501 --> 1:08:29.476
Everyone who was present that
long and informative day,

1:08:29.500 --> 1:08:30.916
I am deeply indebted to.

1:08:33.250 --> 1:08:38.226
Marco, how many times
have I taken your, your,

1:08:38.250 --> 1:08:43.250
your generosity and your
professionalism for granted?

1:08:43.500 --> 1:08:46.476
How hard it must have been to,

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:49.809
to maintain my private life

1:08:49.833 --> 1:08:53.166
while keeping your life
private and your life partners.

1:08:56.875 --> 1:08:57.875
Thanks, Marco.

1:08:59.166 --> 1:09:03.351
At times, dangerous roads are
taken a blessing in disguise,

1:09:03.375 --> 1:09:05.416
as it happens with Pamela.

1:09:06.250 --> 1:09:09.434
Your profound insights are a testament

1:09:09.458 --> 1:09:12.517
that beauty is much more than skin deep,

1:09:12.541 --> 1:09:17.541
and that likes are just
are wants, but only less.

1:09:20.541 --> 1:09:22.416
But you are so much more.

1:09:23.666 --> 1:09:25.517
Thank you, Pamela.
(country music)

1:09:25.541 --> 1:09:28.601
You know, everyone has their demons.

1:09:28.625 --> 1:09:31.375
Mine just happens to
be a guy named Enrico.

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:34.601
And I'm okay with that.

1:09:34.625 --> 1:09:38.291
You know, they say you have
to embrace your shadow,

1:09:39.583 --> 1:09:43.458
even if it doesn't exactly
match your physical form.

1:09:46.958 --> 1:09:49.250
The sooner we accept
that the better, I think.

1:09:50.708 --> 1:09:51.726
I won't deny that in life

1:09:51.750 --> 1:09:54.041
circumstance plays a vital role.

1:09:54.875 --> 1:09:58.017
A man makes plans, the universe laughs.

1:09:58.041 --> 1:09:59.976
Could have been me in that place.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.267
Pretty soon it will be.

1:10:01.291 --> 1:10:03.458
Don't worry, Georgio's the new orange.

1:10:06.125 --> 1:10:07.726
A friend of mine taught
me a little something

1:10:07.750 --> 1:10:11.351
about responsibility
while I was lecturing him

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:12.916
on the subject I might add.

1:10:15.541 --> 1:10:18.083
Tonight, you've seen me with my flaws.

1:10:19.125 --> 1:10:21.458
I stand naked before
you for the first time.

1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:25.267
Maybe not the first time,
I'm really not sure,

1:10:25.291 --> 1:10:27.267
there might have been
cameras in that bedroom.

1:10:27.291 --> 1:10:29.476
I, I really can't remember.

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:32.375
Might be. Lost track.

1:10:33.750 --> 1:10:36.833
But I want you to see me as I am. A man.

1:10:38.666 --> 1:10:41.684
People think that
politicians are unreachable.

1:10:41.708 --> 1:10:45.101
I'm here to tell you that
that's just not true.

1:10:45.125 --> 1:10:48.142
And that is really what
I came here to show you

1:10:48.166 --> 1:10:50.726
because I am a live streamer now.

1:10:50.750 --> 1:10:55.392
You can watch me every
day at gogeorgiogo. go

1:10:55.416 --> 1:10:58.601
- But you already have
millions of follower.

1:10:58.625 --> 1:11:01.976
I can only imagine what that
is going to mean to your base,

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.851
and to your position, your party.

1:11:03.875 --> 1:11:07.934
- I know, it's, but you will see,

1:11:07.958 --> 1:11:10.476
you'll, you'll, you'll
all see that I'm just,

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:14.083
that I am just like you, like you,

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:20.000
only, probably more rich and
certainly more famous, but-

1:11:20.666 --> 1:11:22.642
- And under investigation.

1:11:22.666 --> 1:11:25.809
- Indictment, please get
it right, Carlo, okay?

1:11:25.833 --> 1:11:28.809
I've, you know, I worked
hard for this, okay?

1:11:28.833 --> 1:11:29.916
Don't shortchange me.

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:33.642
Now enough for the monitors.

1:11:33.666 --> 1:11:35.416
Not, all right, look.

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.684
I want you to know.

1:11:38.708 --> 1:11:42.226
I have the blind certainty of my beliefs

1:11:42.250 --> 1:11:46.333
and the flexibility of character
suited for public service.

1:11:47.375 --> 1:11:50.017
I think I have your
friendship and your affection.

1:11:50.041 --> 1:11:53.851
I'm really not certain until
I finally learn your language.

1:11:53.875 --> 1:11:58.875
And I promise to get on that
as soon as I get out of prison,

1:11:59.083 --> 1:12:00.559
which I hope will be soon.

1:12:00.583 --> 1:12:03.726
As soon as I get in, which
I hope will be sooner.

1:12:03.750 --> 1:12:07.184
We're also working on
that and we're in talks

1:12:07.208 --> 1:12:12.208
to hopefully live stream from
the general public in there.

1:12:12.875 --> 1:12:16.601
The rest of the time
will be in house arrest,

1:12:16.625 --> 1:12:18.434
though comfortable,

1:12:18.458 --> 1:12:22.333
I don't think it will provide
as much interesting content,

1:12:23.958 --> 1:12:28.934
but feel free to send us any questions.

1:12:28.958 --> 1:12:33.767
We'll be sending updates on prison tats

1:12:33.791 --> 1:12:37.309
and recipes from in the inside.

1:12:37.333 --> 1:12:40.601
Please don't send any, any
contraband in any cakes.

1:12:40.625 --> 1:12:43.809
I don't wanna extend my, my sentence any.

1:12:43.833 --> 1:12:47.267
Buddy of mine knows all
about that. Don't you Enrico?

1:12:47.291 --> 1:12:50.458
I'm grateful for the time you afforded me

1:12:51.958 --> 1:12:55.250
and the kind invitation to
participate in your process.

1:12:57.250 --> 1:13:00.142
And I, I also want to throw a shout out

1:13:00.166 --> 1:13:04.184
to Pamela's Instagram at Pamela Galante.

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:05.642
Okay?

1:13:05.666 --> 1:13:09.726
And a very special thank
you to my wife, Sylvia,

1:13:09.750 --> 1:13:14.750
who has forgiven my weaknesses
and transformed them for me.

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.976
Thank you, Sylvia.

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.267
You are always there for me.

1:13:20.291 --> 1:13:21.976
Thank you. Where are you, honey?

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.267
Stand up, babe.

1:13:23.291 --> 1:13:24.102
All right, look,

1:13:24.126 --> 1:13:26.142
if you're still gonna
withhold your trust for me,

1:13:26.166 --> 1:13:27.375
just remember one thing-

1:13:28.958 --> 1:13:31.791
- At at, Pamela Galante, I'm sorry.

1:13:37.750 --> 1:13:39.750
(gentle music)
- If someone judges your path,

1:13:40.791 --> 1:13:42.250
let them walk in your shoes.

1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.976
If they can fit in them
or something better.

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:48.810
Eh, wasn't that it?

1:13:48.834 --> 1:13:51.142
Anyway, ciao duty. Anyway, bye-bye!

1:13:51.166 --> 1:13:53.958
I'll see you.
(applause)

1:14:33.041 --> 1:14:34.684
- Waiting long?

1:14:34.708 --> 1:14:35.976
- A bit.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.583
- Ah, sorry. No time
is me time these days.

1:14:41.333 --> 1:14:43.976
- Thanks for coming. I
ordered your favorite tea.

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.375
- Oh, no. No thank you.

1:14:46.708 --> 1:14:49.726
- So I see you have over
2 million followers.

1:14:49.750 --> 1:14:51.226
Business is good.

1:14:51.250 --> 1:14:52.750
- I getting closer to 15,

1:14:54.208 --> 1:14:57.392
but did you invite me here to dazzle?

1:14:57.416 --> 1:14:59.642
Did you have something
important to talk about?

1:14:59.666 --> 1:15:02.101
- Well, there's a client and they want to

1:15:02.125 --> 1:15:03.976
finance a reality show.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.059
He wants to work with us!

1:15:06.083 --> 1:15:07.351
- You mean me?

1:15:07.375 --> 1:15:08.185
- And Martini.

1:15:08.209 --> 1:15:09.309
Of course, Martini.

1:15:09.333 --> 1:15:10.601
Won't be cheap.

1:15:10.625 --> 1:15:12.726
- I didn't expect it to be.

1:15:12.750 --> 1:15:14.101
- Okay.

1:15:14.125 --> 1:15:17.017
Tell your client if they
want to do the show,

1:15:17.041 --> 1:15:20.101
they cover production
costs and we take 50%.

1:15:20.125 --> 1:15:21.125
- 50%?

1:15:22.291 --> 1:15:23.767
They never go for that.

1:15:23.791 --> 1:15:26.434
- If they want our faces in the show.

1:15:26.458 --> 1:15:27.458
That's the deal.

1:15:28.500 --> 1:15:32.833
If they wait I tell 15
million, the cost would be 16.

1:15:33.750 --> 1:15:36.351
- Okay. I make it happen.

1:15:36.375 --> 1:15:39.809
- Okay, good. I like it
when you do your job.

1:15:39.833 --> 1:15:42.517
- Is 15 million going to make you happy?

1:15:42.541 --> 1:15:44.767
- Happy doesn't matter
when you are the one

1:15:44.791 --> 1:15:46.625
that decide what makes people happy.

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:57.126
- [Georgio] I won't deny
that in life circumstance

1:16:00.083 --> 1:16:02.976
A man makes plans the universe laughs.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.017
Could have been me in that place.

1:16:05.041 --> 1:16:06.226
Pretty soon it will be.

1:16:06.250 --> 1:16:08.416
Don't worry. Georgio's the new orange.

1:16:10.750 --> 1:16:12.642
A friend of mine taught
me a little something

1:16:12.666 --> 1:16:13.958
about responsibility,

1:16:14.916 --> 1:16:17.958
while I was lecturing him
on the subject, I might add.

1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:23.083
Tonight, you've seen me with my flaws.

1:16:24.083 --> 1:16:26.458
I stand naked before
you for the first time.

1:16:28.416 --> 1:16:29.642
Maybe not the first time.

1:16:29.666 --> 1:16:30.477
I'm really not sure.

1:16:30.501 --> 1:16:32.226
There might have been
cameras in that bedroom.

1:16:32.250 --> 1:16:34.392
I, I really can't remember.

1:16:34.416 --> 1:16:36.958
Might be. Lost track.

1:16:38.708 --> 1:16:41.791
But I want you to see me as I am. A man.

1:16:43.708 --> 1:16:46.809
People think that
politicians are unreachable.

1:16:46.833 --> 1:16:49.809
Well, I'm here to tell
you tonight, they're not,

1:16:49.833 --> 1:16:53.851
because I wanted to show you that

1:16:53.875 --> 1:16:56.559
I am now a live streamer.

1:16:56.583 --> 1:17:00.125
You can now watch me and
follow me at gogeorgiogo.go.

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:05.309
What did I miss?

1:17:05.333 --> 1:17:06.310
- [Enrico] Nothing big, really.

1:17:06.334 --> 1:17:08.476
- You were standing naked before us.

1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:09.726
- Exactly.

1:17:09.750 --> 1:17:12.000
- Hey.
- Oh, in prime time!

1:17:18.625 --> 1:17:20.101
- That's a very noble concern. I know.

1:17:20.125 --> 1:17:21.642
You know, they're considering
me for prime minister.

1:17:21.666 --> 1:17:23.226
I should make you Minister of Education.

1:17:23.250 --> 1:17:24.892
- No, thank you.

1:17:24.916 --> 1:17:27.392
I want a position with the some power.

1:17:27.416 --> 1:17:29.684
I want my own talk show.

1:17:29.708 --> 1:17:31.142
- In what language?

1:17:31.166 --> 1:17:33.434
(snorts)
As crazy as it sounds.

1:17:33.458 --> 1:17:34.809
What about you, Marco?

1:17:34.833 --> 1:17:36.559
How does Minister of Culture sound?

1:17:36.583 --> 1:17:39.101
- Hmm. Like the name of a rapper.

1:17:39.125 --> 1:17:39.977
- I can see that.

1:17:40.001 --> 1:17:41.059
- Yeah. See what you did there.

1:17:41.083 --> 1:17:42.726
- But I like it. Thank you.

1:17:42.750 --> 1:17:43.750
- Cheers.

1:17:44.833 --> 1:17:46.375
Enrico. Marco.

1:17:47.458 --> 1:17:50.476
I can't offer you a low
level position in government

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:51.976
due to your felony conviction.

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:55.809
That's unfortunately
reserved for higher offices,

1:17:55.833 --> 1:17:58.601
but I would very much like you to

1:17:58.625 --> 1:18:01.625
come back to work with
me at Geodio Enterprises.

1:18:03.458 --> 1:18:05.517
- No, thank you, Georgio.
- Okay.

1:18:05.541 --> 1:18:06.583
Oh, sorry.
- Thanks.

1:18:08.041 --> 1:18:12.708
- But, I have a feeling, I
know how that may end up.

1:18:15.250 --> 1:18:17.351
Besides,
- As it happens,

1:18:17.375 --> 1:18:22.375
- I have some personal projects
I'm working on right now.

1:18:26.375 --> 1:18:27.625
- All right. Okay.

1:18:29.708 --> 1:18:33.101
- As a matter of fact,
I really must be going.

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:35.500
- [Georgio] But you have so much promise.

1:18:36.625 --> 1:18:38.291
Thank you, Pamela.
- Thank you.

1:18:41.625 --> 1:18:45.375
- Mine just happens to
be a guy named Enrico.

1:18:46.250 --> 1:18:47.143
I'm okay.

1:18:47.167 --> 1:18:50.625
You know, they say you have
to embrace your shadow,

1:18:52.208 --> 1:18:54.625
even if it doesn't exactly

1:19:12.750 --> 1:19:15.958
Hey. Yo, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:19:18.625 --> 1:19:22.375
Is there any way I can
get you to reconsider?

1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:28.309
Because I really think
that I need you right now.

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:33.166
- No, you don't. Trust me.

1:19:36.083 --> 1:19:39.250
I carried you around for a long while.

1:19:42.291 --> 1:19:46.541
I just realized that the
only thing it was good for

1:19:50.583 --> 1:19:52.000
was get rid of you.

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:54.583
- No, none taken.

1:19:55.666 --> 1:19:57.226
Did you write that?

1:19:57.250 --> 1:19:59.559
- I suppose.
- Yeah, it was good.

1:19:59.583 --> 1:20:00.583
Wish I did.

1:20:02.583 --> 1:20:03.583
I'm gonna read this.

1:20:04.916 --> 1:20:06.309
Is there more?

1:20:06.333 --> 1:20:10.351
Is that the personal project
you were you're gonna work on?

1:20:10.375 --> 1:20:15.375
- No, I just said that
to get away from you.

1:20:17.041 --> 1:20:18.750
- Oh, okay.

1:20:20.125 --> 1:20:22.625
- And yes, there was more.

1:20:24.458 --> 1:20:29.458
You know, in prison,
I wrote one act plays.

1:20:31.083 --> 1:20:32.559
- Really?

1:20:32.583 --> 1:20:34.101
See, I would've never,

1:20:34.125 --> 1:20:36.517
I would've never guessed that about you.

1:20:36.541 --> 1:20:37.393
- Yeah.

1:20:37.417 --> 1:20:41.517
One was about Tim Buckley
meeting Jeff Buckley

1:20:41.541 --> 1:20:46.541
and in afterlife and Chama with her son.

1:20:50.208 --> 1:20:52.458
- Okay. Now that is insane!

1:20:55.041 --> 1:20:56.767
In the very best sense of the word.

1:20:56.791 --> 1:20:58.226
- Oh.

1:20:58.250 --> 1:21:01.750
And another is about a man in submarine

1:21:02.708 --> 1:21:07.184
that malfunctions at 500 meters.

1:21:07.208 --> 1:21:12.208
And he writes a sonnet in Morse code

1:21:12.708 --> 1:21:15.559
before oxygen runs out.

1:21:15.583 --> 1:21:17.934
- Dude, you are killing me right now.

1:21:17.958 --> 1:21:19.976
- Right. And, and, and there are more.

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:24.791
Yeah, but you don't know me, really.

1:21:27.750 --> 1:21:32.559
Excuse me, but now I have to go.

1:21:32.583 --> 1:21:33.976
Huh?
- All right.

1:21:34.000 --> 1:21:37.916
All right. But can I still call you?

1:21:40.250 --> 1:21:41.392
And you have Marco's number, right?

1:21:41.416 --> 1:21:42.750
I mean, he could, we can,

1:21:43.916 --> 1:21:46.476
I guess parents are coming back too.

1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:48.392
And I, I guess it might be a good idea

1:21:48.416 --> 1:21:52.309
if you come back and clear
up some of those landmines,

1:21:52.333 --> 1:21:53.601
and you get, if you're
in the neighborhood,

1:21:53.625 --> 1:21:55.809
I guess they can put us on a group text

1:21:55.833 --> 1:21:57.517
or something like that.

1:21:57.541 --> 1:22:00.017
But if it's convenient,
or don't worry about it.

1:22:00.041 --> 1:22:01.041
- I reach out.

1:22:02.666 --> 1:22:05.184
I should really get going now.
- Yeah, I don't hold you up.

1:22:05.208 --> 1:22:07.541
Man, thanks for coming,
all right? Thank you.

1:22:09.125 --> 1:22:10.125
Good to see you.

1:22:11.916 --> 1:22:13.750
