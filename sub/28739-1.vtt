01:13.565 --> 01:14.565
Hey.

01:15.845 --> 01:16.845
Hey.

01:20.005 --> 01:21.325
You here by yourself?

01:23.325 --> 01:25.365
- So far.
- Oh.

01:26.685 --> 01:28.565
It's a shame. A pretty girl like you.

01:29.805 --> 01:32.885
- OK, corny.
- Oh!

01:35.085 --> 01:37.165
Maybe I can make up for it
by buying you a drink?

01:39.485 --> 01:40.485
Sure.

01:41.325 --> 01:42.805
- Bartender.
- Yeah?

01:43.605 --> 01:48.205
Let me get a Buck and a vodka sidecar.

01:51.925 --> 01:54.005
What makes you think
I want a vodka sidecar?

01:54.085 --> 01:55.485
Maybe I know what you like.

01:56.005 --> 01:57.645
There they are.

01:57.725 --> 01:59.085
Hey!

02:03.285 --> 02:04.125
Right on time.

02:04.205 --> 02:06.805
- Hey, Karl.
- Hey, what up, girl? This is Daisy.

02:06.885 --> 02:08.245
- Oh.
- Ooh!

02:08.324 --> 02:10.245
- Daisy, this is Danny and Theo.
- Hi.

02:10.324 --> 02:11.325
Hey, lady.

02:11.485 --> 02:13.245
This is my roommates
I was telling you about.

02:13.325 --> 02:16.565
The ones who hooked up just so they can
get the biggest room in the apartment.

02:16.645 --> 02:17.685
Very true.

02:18.285 --> 02:20.525
- Let me get you all a drink.
- You're right.

02:20.605 --> 02:22.805
Get your asses on the dance floor.

02:22.885 --> 02:24.205
- Come on, girl.
- There we go.

02:25.525 --> 02:30.605
Hey. That little role-play act,
the stranger thing at the bar?

02:32.245 --> 02:33.565
Got me hot as fuck.

02:35.365 --> 02:40.165
Ooh. Mental note to self,
my baby's into role-play.

02:40.365 --> 02:42.965
<i> The sound is yours...</i>

02:43.045 --> 02:44.285
You know it.

02:55.365 --> 02:57.565
<i>What do you do</i>
<i>when you dance in a club</i>

02:57.645 --> 02:59.165
<i>and the place is packed and jamming?</i>

03:49.725 --> 03:51.485
<i> Round one. Fight.</i>

03:57.965 --> 03:59.365
You're just in time.

03:59.445 --> 04:01.285
Aww...

04:01.765 --> 04:03.125
Man, I gotta work tomorrow.

04:03.205 --> 04:04.605
Fuck your work.

04:12.605 --> 04:13.805
<i>New game.</i>

04:19.445 --> 04:23.045
No. No, no, no.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.725
No!

04:32.005 --> 04:33.765
- Fuck.
<i>-  Roxette wins.</i>

04:33.845 --> 04:34.845
All right, man.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.445
- OK, one more.
- No, man. It's too late.

04:40.525 --> 04:42.085
Decision made.

04:43.645 --> 04:44.565
Shit.

04:44.645 --> 04:46.565
Oh, look, he picks Roxette again.

04:46.645 --> 04:48.925
But you've been Lance
for 20 bouts straight.

04:49.005 --> 04:50.685
- Come on.
- I know you not bitching.

04:50.765 --> 04:52.365
- Where we going, Panda Mountain?
- Sucks.

04:52.445 --> 04:54.445
- Crystal Beach?
- Let's go for the Temple.

04:55.645 --> 04:57.045
- Here we go.
<i>- Secret Temple.</i>

04:57.125 --> 05:01.085
- Get ready to get your ass kicked.
- Yeah? Roxette's gonna fuck your head off.

05:01.165 --> 05:03.285
- That don't even make sense.
- Fuck your head off.

05:03.365 --> 05:04.485
What does that mean?

05:05.485 --> 05:07.005
<i>Round one. Fight.</i>

05:08.205 --> 05:10.005
Come on. Come on.

05:10.085 --> 05:11.085
Oh!

05:13.245 --> 05:15.965
All right, get up, come on. Come on.
Come on.

05:16.685 --> 05:17.765
No.

05:19.965 --> 05:20.845
Get out of here.

05:21.485 --> 05:25.165
- <i> You like? What now?</i>
- Negative.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.085
- Come on, man.
<i>-  That's done.</i>

05:31.165 --> 05:33.965
<i> K.O. Perfect.</i>

05:35.405 --> 05:36.445
You woke me up.

05:38.765 --> 05:40.005
Too damn loud.

05:41.245 --> 05:43.165
- You want some of this?
- Baby.

05:43.245 --> 05:44.165
"Baby."

05:45.445 --> 05:47.405
- Quiet that shit down.
- Baby.

05:50.605 --> 05:52.965
Baby! Baby! Baby!

06:07.005 --> 06:08.685
Birthday boy!

06:08.765 --> 06:10.845
Birthday boy.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.485
Hey.

06:14.325 --> 06:16.245
Congratulations. How old are you now?

06:16.845 --> 06:18.445
Uh, 38.

06:19.685 --> 06:21.405
- Forty's a-coming.
- Yeah.

06:21.485 --> 06:23.005
Soon be dead, huh?

06:23.805 --> 06:24.805
Sure.

06:25.445 --> 06:27.085
- Have you met Simon?
- Hey.

06:27.925 --> 06:28.885
Uh...

06:29.245 --> 06:31.445
- Don't think so.
- I don't think we did, no, no.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.405
OK. Simon's into bikes.

06:35.085 --> 06:35.925
That's cool.

06:36.445 --> 06:38.805
Cool. That's cool.

06:38.885 --> 06:41.085
Maxwell. We don't kick. No kicking.

06:42.285 --> 06:44.045
Look at him. Sorry. I'm sorry.

06:54.125 --> 06:58.045
- Do you like motorcycles or just bikes?
- Just bikes.

07:00.685 --> 07:01.525
Cool.

07:23.925 --> 07:25.405
- Tag!
- Tyler, go on outside.

07:25.485 --> 07:26.645
Sorry!

07:27.685 --> 07:28.925
- Sorry.
- Let me...

07:29.005 --> 07:31.405
- I'll get that.
- Did he get it on you?

07:31.645 --> 07:33.725
Yeah, you just... Don't worry.

07:45.405 --> 07:46.285
Karl.

07:47.605 --> 07:51.885
- Hey, Theo.
- I have not seen you in how long?

07:51.965 --> 07:54.805
However long, it feels longer.

07:55.445 --> 07:57.245
Is Daisy parking the car?

07:57.325 --> 07:59.245
Oh, uh...

07:59.325 --> 08:01.885
Me and Daisy,
no, we're not together anymore.

08:01.965 --> 08:03.765
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

08:03.845 --> 08:09.085
No, no, no. It's... it's cool, really,
we broke up, like, a year ago.

08:09.885 --> 08:13.205
No clue. He... I'm not on Facebook, so...

08:13.925 --> 08:15.445
I can be a dumbass about these things.

08:15.525 --> 08:16.965
No. Really, it's all good.

08:17.045 --> 08:20.925
We're still friends. Better friends,
actually. It's all very adult.

08:22.165 --> 08:25.205
- Well, come in, come in.
- All right.

08:25.285 --> 08:26.685
- Danny's out back.
- OK.

08:40.005 --> 08:41.885
We're not gonna punch,
we're not gonna kick. OK?

08:42.645 --> 08:44.405
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

08:45.245 --> 08:47.165
OK, go play, no fighting.

08:49.485 --> 08:51.725
Goddamn it. Come on.

08:55.925 --> 08:58.365
Can't beat a little home cooking.

09:01.685 --> 09:03.045
- Hey, man.
- What's going on?

09:04.205 --> 09:05.365
Oh, wow, handshake?

09:06.245 --> 09:08.925
What am I, like, infected or something?

09:09.005 --> 09:10.085
Fuck you.

09:10.165 --> 09:12.405
Come on, get in here, man.

09:13.245 --> 09:15.885
Ah, that's better,
let it out, buddy, let it out.

09:16.565 --> 09:18.005
You're still an asshole, I see.

09:18.085 --> 09:19.445
Happy birthday.

09:19.645 --> 09:20.485
Oh, wow.

09:20.565 --> 09:21.925
When did you start using gift bags?

09:22.005 --> 09:23.325
The store did that.

09:23.405 --> 09:24.245
You gonna open it?

09:29.725 --> 09:35.165
<i>- Striking Vipers.</i>
<i>- X. Striking Vipers X.</i>

09:35.245 --> 09:37.405
Newest instalment.
Came out just yesterday.

09:37.485 --> 09:38.525
I was in the store,

09:38.605 --> 09:39.885
I saw it and...

09:39.965 --> 09:41.525
Oh, man.

09:42.525 --> 09:43.725
This takes me back.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.565
It says here
you need one of those VR add-ons.

09:47.645 --> 09:50.765
- I don't have one of those.
- Yes, you do.

09:55.445 --> 09:57.445
- No.
- Eh...

10:00.325 --> 10:03.405
No. No, come on, man.

10:03.485 --> 10:07.485
No. It's your birthday,
just take the damn thing, would you?

10:07.565 --> 10:11.725
Seriously, you gonna flip the fuck out.
I tried it out in the store.

10:11.805 --> 10:16.285
They demoed it for me.
Five minutes blew my mind to confetti.

10:18.925 --> 10:20.525
- Thanks, man.
- It's all good.

10:23.005 --> 10:23.925
That your one?

10:25.845 --> 10:27.205
No, that's Maxwell.

10:27.285 --> 10:28.845
Maxwell. Guys, guys.

10:28.925 --> 10:31.525
Tyler's friend from school.

10:34.285 --> 10:38.445
- You want a beer, man?
- Finally he saves me. Yes.

10:41.925 --> 10:43.205
Thank you.

10:44.085 --> 10:47.445
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
I've been playing with Katie.

10:48.085 --> 10:51.205
Theo,
are we using the plastic cups?

10:51.285 --> 10:52.405
Theo's looking good.

10:53.885 --> 10:54.725
Uh-huh.

10:54.805 --> 10:57.045
Good to see at least one of you
still has a gym membership.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.405
Oh, really?

10:58.485 --> 10:59.805
Seriously, man.

11:00.765 --> 11:03.205
You're walking around
like a fucking Frankenstein movie.

11:03.285 --> 11:07.045
Look, since my knee went, I haven't
been able to work out, all right?

11:07.125 --> 11:08.965
I'm not using that as an excuse.
I'm just...

11:09.045 --> 11:12.565
- No, no, no, of course not.
- Hey, fuck you, all right?

11:12.645 --> 11:15.285
I can afford to let things slide.
I'm settled.

11:15.365 --> 11:18.605
I thank God I don't have to be out there
on the dating scene.

11:18.685 --> 11:21.925
Always on sale. Fucking bullshit.

11:22.005 --> 11:23.285
It is like a second job.

11:23.365 --> 11:24.965
Gotta keep up with those younger dudes.

11:25.045 --> 11:26.605
You gotta do a thousand crunches a day?

11:26.685 --> 11:30.245
- Only 50 each morning.
- Fifty in the morning?

11:30.325 --> 11:31.525
Mm-hmm.

11:31.605 --> 11:32.725
You wax your ballsack?

11:33.765 --> 11:35.805
I'm sure as shit those young dudes do.

11:37.205 --> 11:39.645
You wax your ball... You nasty.

11:39.965 --> 11:42.085
Till it's gleaming like an eight ball.

11:44.085 --> 11:46.005
Just to stay in the game.

11:47.485 --> 11:50.045
- I pity you, really.
- Yeah. Well...

11:53.205 --> 11:55.245
You wanna know where I'm going
after I leave here?

11:55.325 --> 11:57.725
Shit, getting your taint waxed too?

11:58.805 --> 12:02.125
Meeting Mariella.

12:02.965 --> 12:05.845
- Mariella.
- She does backing vocals.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.285
What, for the school band?

12:07.365 --> 12:08.205
How old is she?

12:08.885 --> 12:09.725
Twenty-nine.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.925
No, 28. See. Here she is again.

12:15.005 --> 12:16.525
Yeah.

12:18.805 --> 12:21.685
- You wanna share that with the class?
- Mm-mm.

12:28.645 --> 12:30.725
- You lucky man.
- I am, me.

12:37.645 --> 12:40.085
What are you doing? What are you doing?

12:50.205 --> 12:52.045
- Tyler asleep?
- Mm-hmm.

12:52.125 --> 12:56.765
Had to read that damn Macaroo book again
before he'd let me put out the light.

12:58.765 --> 12:59.965
"Macaroo found a shoe..."

13:00.045 --> 13:01.445
"And put it in a tree."

13:02.205 --> 13:04.565
Macaroo's got no respect
for his environment,

13:04.645 --> 13:06.165
that's all I'm saying.

13:07.205 --> 13:09.845
- I can do that.
- No, I'm fine.

13:09.925 --> 13:12.565
Mm-mm. It's your birthday, come on.

13:18.205 --> 13:20.925
Thank you.

13:21.005 --> 13:22.165
OK.

13:24.725 --> 13:28.565
You know, you should've told me
that Karl and Daisy broke up.

13:29.765 --> 13:32.205
- Did he say who broke up with who?
- I didn't ask.

13:33.365 --> 13:36.685
I always said that those two
were not good news together.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.245
So long since I saw him last.

13:40.325 --> 13:43.805
- Had to be last year's birthday, I think.
- In the flesh, a whole year?

13:45.685 --> 13:48.045
Him and the girl on his phone,
is that serious?

13:50.925 --> 13:51.965
I didn't ask.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.845
Guys suck at talking.
How long have you two known each other?

13:55.925 --> 13:59.405
You don't actually get to talk
at these things, though, do you?

13:59.605 --> 14:01.645
I mean, beyond surface bullshit.

14:01.965 --> 14:04.845
Or parent talk.
There's a lot of that these days.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.765
Y'all should hang out more.

14:07.045 --> 14:10.045
Yeah, well, you know, work.

14:11.005 --> 14:12.085
And we're parents.

14:12.725 --> 14:15.805
He's downtown with the label
and we're out here.

14:16.485 --> 14:20.325
We should have him over for dinner.
You could make your chili.

14:24.205 --> 14:25.045
Sure.

14:29.045 --> 14:30.565
<i> Flatware hazard warning.</i>

14:30.645 --> 14:33.005
You gotta put the knives in
sharp edge down.

14:33.085 --> 14:34.405
I know.

14:46.445 --> 14:48.365
Check out the Rodman look on this guy.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.845
How are you? Yeah?

14:52.405 --> 14:53.285
Rodman?

14:53.365 --> 14:54.845
Dennis Rodman.

15:01.965 --> 15:04.365
- He used to be a ball player, right?
- Right.

15:05.925 --> 15:08.405
The hair. Got it.

15:13.925 --> 15:18.485
The app says we need to do it
within the hour. It's peak fertility.

15:21.005 --> 15:23.325
I'm kind of beat
but I guess that we should.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.405
You not into it?

15:28.725 --> 15:31.245
I just ate so much, I don't know if I can.

15:33.005 --> 15:35.365
- It's best to save it up, though, right?
- Mm-hmm.

15:36.485 --> 15:37.845
Mind if I go to sleep?

15:41.205 --> 15:42.205
No.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.645
I love you, baby.

15:50.365 --> 15:51.565
Love you, too.

16:01.885 --> 16:03.125
Shit.

16:44.205 --> 16:47.285
- Hey, man.
- Hey, you still awake? You wanna game?

16:48.525 --> 16:49.925
Maybe not tonight. I was...

16:50.005 --> 16:51.805
Come on, what are you playing?

16:52.005 --> 16:54.245
Something goddamn boring
is what I'm guessing.

16:54.325 --> 16:56.045
All right, you got me.

16:56.125 --> 16:59.325
All right, so grab the experiencer disc
I got you, put it on and jump in.

16:59.565 --> 17:01.885
<i>Seriously, man, it's insane.</i>

17:01.965 --> 17:06.085
You're gonna freak. You're gonna shit
your pelvis through your asshole.

17:07.765 --> 17:10.885
- OK. What do I do?
- All right, they showed me in the store.

17:10.964 --> 17:14.885
- You put the game chip in.
- Done.

17:14.964 --> 17:18.765
Now grab the disc doohickey
and stick it upside your head.

17:19.243 --> 17:21.243
- Left or right side?
<i>- Doesn't matter.</i>

17:27.685 --> 17:28.685
<i>- Done.</i>
- OK.

17:28.765 --> 17:30.885
Now hold down the sync button
on the controller.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.005
Nothing's happening.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.925
We haven't chosen our fighters yet.

17:35.005 --> 17:36.445
So, I am...

17:37.525 --> 17:38.765
<i> Roxette.</i>

17:39.405 --> 17:41.845
OK, so where's my guy?

17:43.205 --> 17:45.685
- <i> Lance.</i>
- Damn. All right, Lance, let's go.

17:45.765 --> 17:50.125
OK, you have to brace yourself.

17:50.205 --> 17:51.405
Brace myself. Come on.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.445
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

17:54.525 --> 17:56.325
Three, two...

17:58.605 --> 17:59.565
one.

18:07.325 --> 18:08.845
Whoa!

18:10.325 --> 18:11.525
Oh, my God.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.285
Whoa!

18:16.805 --> 18:18.885
This is crazy.

18:20.925 --> 18:23.605
- What the fuck...?
- Yo, Danny.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.205
Said you gotta brace yourself.

18:27.765 --> 18:28.765
Karl?

18:30.205 --> 18:31.805
Crazy shit, huh?

18:37.765 --> 18:40.365
Like, I feel solid.

18:40.445 --> 18:44.285
You think your chest is impressive?
Check this shit out.

18:44.765 --> 18:45.685
<i>Whoo!</i>

18:46.285 --> 18:47.925
- This is just...
- I know, right?

18:49.165 --> 18:50.085
How's the knee?

18:55.365 --> 18:56.365
Pretty good.

19:01.325 --> 19:04.565
Man, in here, you can do so much shit
you can't do out there.

19:07.205 --> 19:08.765
OK, enough of the Captain Acrobat shit.

19:10.005 --> 19:12.085
- You ready to fight?
- I'm ready.

19:14.245 --> 19:15.445
<i> Round one.</i>

19:15.525 --> 19:16.965
<i> Fight.</i>

19:18.845 --> 19:20.365
Whoa. Hold on a minute.

19:21.045 --> 19:22.045
Is this going to hurt?

19:22.125 --> 19:24.245
"The game emulates
all physical sensations."

19:24.325 --> 19:25.365
Is that a yes or a no?

19:26.285 --> 19:27.125
It does.

19:32.965 --> 19:34.165
Peace out.

19:43.605 --> 19:45.045
I'm gonna fuck you up.

19:46.405 --> 19:47.405
Thunder punch.

19:50.005 --> 19:51.165
Windmill wipe-out.

19:54.565 --> 19:56.125
That the best you can do, man?

19:58.325 --> 19:59.205
Jesus Christ.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.725
Don't worry, it resets. No harm done.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.725
That's messed up.

20:04.805 --> 20:06.045
<i> Round two.</i>

20:06.125 --> 20:07.725
- Hold on. Shit, I'm rusty.
<i>- Fight.</i>

20:09.485 --> 20:11.965
I can't remember
what moves this guy can do.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.125
It's like riding a bike.

20:15.925 --> 20:19.005
- See? Nice block.
- Thanks.

20:22.685 --> 20:23.805
Hyperstrike!

20:24.925 --> 20:25.805
That's double.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.845
Tornado fury.

20:29.565 --> 20:31.165
The leg, the leg, the leg, the leg.

21:22.845 --> 21:25.885
No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

21:30.365 --> 21:32.805
How do I get out of here?
How do I get out of here?

21:33.485 --> 21:34.485
Exit game.

21:38.725 --> 21:40.805
Exit... Exit game!

21:44.125 --> 21:45.165
Oh, shit.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.725
Holy shit.

22:24.125 --> 22:27.645
Hello. Where did he come from?

23:20.525 --> 23:21.765
That's my cab.

23:24.405 --> 23:26.845
- Good night, little man.
- Good night.

23:26.925 --> 23:29.485
- Take care of Daddy for me, OK?
- OK.

23:29.565 --> 23:30.565
Mm-hmm.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.725
I'm not sure when I'll be back.
Depends on traffic, I guess.

23:35.805 --> 23:36.965
Have fun, OK?

23:43.205 --> 23:45.125
<i> Battle stations.</i>

23:48.125 --> 23:50.125
<i> Battle stations.</i>

23:58.245 --> 24:00.685
"his shoe and put it in a tree."

24:00.765 --> 24:07.325
Very good. "The shiny side made a slide.
He slid down happily."

24:08.165 --> 24:09.685
<i> "He fixed the leaves..."</i>

24:11.685 --> 24:12.805
<i> Game over.</i>

24:40.405 --> 24:41.685
Hey, there.

24:43.205 --> 24:44.845
Hey. I can't play long, I...

24:44.925 --> 24:46.165
Oh, sure, me too.

24:46.245 --> 24:47.085
<i>Look...</i>

24:48.605 --> 24:52.005
Last time we played,
I was drunk, man, from the party.

24:52.765 --> 24:53.605
Me, too.

24:55.845 --> 24:56.805
Cool.

24:59.245 --> 25:00.085
OK.

25:01.445 --> 25:04.645
Be good to have a serious game,
you know?

25:04.725 --> 25:06.245
Serious game.

25:08.285 --> 25:09.485
Serious game.

25:11.645 --> 25:12.645
Here we go.

25:21.485 --> 25:23.805
About to kick your ass, motherfucker.

25:24.725 --> 25:26.885
Yeah? You're gonna try.

25:26.965 --> 25:29.845
<i> Round one. Fight.</i>

26:03.165 --> 26:08.005
- Come on, come on! Please, please!
- Stop it! No! I'm going.

26:11.765 --> 26:15.805
Can you hear me? Yes.
Can you hear me now?

26:16.925 --> 26:18.325
You're the driver, right?

26:19.725 --> 26:21.685
Yeah, I'm outside of the Taphouse.

26:23.045 --> 26:24.245
Taphouse.

27:14.805 --> 27:18.205
So, guess that's us gay now.

27:24.205 --> 27:25.045
That's a joke.

27:26.045 --> 27:26.885
Huh.

27:27.485 --> 27:28.925
Don't feel like a gay thing.

27:34.325 --> 27:35.525
- What is it?
- Jesus.

27:36.525 --> 27:37.485
Exit game.

27:40.445 --> 27:43.885
What? You're supposed to be in bed.

27:43.965 --> 27:45.045
I'm thirsty.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.365
You're thirsty?

28:37.485 --> 28:38.645
- You finished?
- Yes.

28:38.725 --> 28:39.845
Yes what?

28:39.925 --> 28:42.765
- Yes, thank you.
- Go ahead.

28:47.885 --> 28:51.525
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey there, little man.

28:57.605 --> 29:00.325
- Looks like you can use one of these.
- Mm-hmm.

29:01.685 --> 29:03.445
Feels like a dog died in my damn head.

29:07.285 --> 29:08.805
You weren't supposed to drink.

29:09.005 --> 29:11.885
I figured my period was late.
And I hoped it was.

29:12.965 --> 29:15.005
And then it came on while I was out, so.

29:18.045 --> 29:19.485
I just said fuck it.

29:21.045 --> 29:22.125
I'm sorry.

29:24.845 --> 29:26.005
Next time.

29:28.165 --> 29:29.285
Nose kiss.

29:54.365 --> 29:57.045
<i> Please rinse dishes</i>
<i>before program start.</i>

30:24.845 --> 30:27.125
<i> Round one. Fight.</i>

31:33.605 --> 31:37.805
I'm sorry, baby. I'm just tired, OK?

32:35.485 --> 32:38.805
OK,
I know when you're thinking.

32:39.605 --> 32:40.605
What's up?

32:44.365 --> 32:45.645
How does it feel?

32:47.685 --> 32:52.725
I mean, like, for you,
being in a woman's body while...

32:54.485 --> 32:55.805
Crazy.

32:58.965 --> 33:01.605
It's crazy.

33:03.005 --> 33:05.445
I mean, it's different.

33:06.085 --> 33:06.925
Like...

33:07.845 --> 33:10.445
the physical feeling of it?

33:10.525 --> 33:11.765
It's more sort of...

33:14.965 --> 33:16.245
satisfying.

33:18.205 --> 33:19.605
I can't really explain it.

33:20.725 --> 33:26.925
Like, one's a guitar solo,
the other's a whole fucking orchestra.

33:28.405 --> 33:30.045
But the tune's basically the same.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.405
Different tempos, though.

33:32.485 --> 33:35.565
Yeah, I think you've run that analogy
to the ground.

33:36.245 --> 33:37.245
Fuck you.

34:08.525 --> 34:10.685
I'd like you to push my feet down.

34:11.565 --> 34:12.844
Listen here, mister.

34:13.804 --> 34:14.925
Listen here.

35:02.765 --> 35:03.765
Shit.

35:44.845 --> 35:49.085
<i>♪ While I'm alone and blue as can be ♪</i>

35:49.805 --> 35:53.565
<i>♪ Dream a little dream of me ♪</i>

35:55.045 --> 35:56.565
<i>♪ Stars fading... ♪</i>

35:56.645 --> 35:58.565
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:58.645 --> 36:00.045
Can I, uh...

36:02.565 --> 36:05.245
Should I not? I was just gonna ask
if I could buy you a drink.

36:09.045 --> 36:12.045
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

36:12.125 --> 36:14.845
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry.

36:15.445 --> 36:16.445
Don't be.

36:16.605 --> 36:19.885
- No, seriously.
- Seriously.

36:23.005 --> 36:23.885
I'll leave you alone.

36:23.965 --> 36:24.925
Mm-hmm.

36:26.205 --> 36:27.405
Sorry.

36:35.045 --> 36:36.045
Hey.

36:40.685 --> 36:42.925
- It's all good?
- It was great, thank you.

36:45.605 --> 36:47.165
Your dessert's on the way.

36:52.885 --> 36:54.165
That was good.

36:54.245 --> 36:55.085
Hmm.

36:55.165 --> 36:56.765
Mm-hmm.

37:04.925 --> 37:06.245
You know the thing about you?

37:07.445 --> 37:09.525
Sometimes you just sort of go away.

37:10.565 --> 37:13.085
- What do you mean?
- I mean, you shrivel away.

37:14.285 --> 37:17.405
You go inside. Leave me on the outside.

37:21.125 --> 37:22.045
Are you in there?

37:22.125 --> 37:24.725
Of course I am.

37:25.405 --> 37:27.485
OK. So then, what's up?

37:28.565 --> 37:29.405
Nothing.

37:32.285 --> 37:34.165
We haven't done it in weeks.

37:34.925 --> 37:36.085
I've been tired.

37:37.485 --> 37:39.845
- We're meant to be trying again.
- We are trying again.

37:39.925 --> 37:42.965
No. Won't get pregnant
if you don't fuck me, Danny.

37:43.045 --> 37:43.885
Jesus.

37:46.165 --> 37:47.325
It's not that I don't want to.

37:49.565 --> 37:51.685
I said I've been tired.

37:52.525 --> 37:53.805
I'm sorry...

37:55.845 --> 37:57.285
but is something going on?

37:57.365 --> 37:58.645
Something going on?

37:58.725 --> 37:59.845
That's what I said.

38:00.925 --> 38:02.405
Nothing is going on.

38:06.645 --> 38:07.805
Then what is it?

38:10.365 --> 38:12.285
- Is it me?
- No.

38:12.405 --> 38:15.045
- You don't touch me anymore.
- Theo.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.805
You don't even kiss me.

38:17.965 --> 38:19.725
There is none of the small stuff.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.525
Squeeze my shoulder.

38:22.805 --> 38:24.845
A hand on my back
as you pass me in the kitchen.

38:24.925 --> 38:26.605
- Theo.
- Not even that.

38:27.525 --> 38:29.125
Do you want me any more?

38:29.725 --> 38:30.885
I'll always want you.

38:30.965 --> 38:35.165
No. You know what I mean,
I mean, me. This. This.

38:47.485 --> 38:51.885
I know that I'm not what I was.
My body is not what it was since Tyler.

38:51.965 --> 38:53.125
Don't say that.

38:55.045 --> 38:56.405
Are you seeing someone?

38:58.245 --> 38:59.085
No.

39:01.565 --> 39:02.485
No.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.525
So why don't you want me?
You always used to want me.

39:14.125 --> 39:16.525
It's boring, I get that.

39:16.605 --> 39:17.885
Family life?

39:20.045 --> 39:21.845
Shit, I find it boring.

39:23.965 --> 39:25.045
But I am loyal.

39:25.125 --> 39:28.525
I'm loyal to our family. I'm loyal to you.

39:29.725 --> 39:32.405
God knows if I wanted,
I could go out and do whatever.

39:33.325 --> 39:35.085
You think I haven't made sacrifices?

39:35.165 --> 39:37.165
I haven't denied things for myself?

39:40.005 --> 39:42.125
A guy at the bar earlier
tried hitting on me.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.245
Half of me wanted him to,
just for some excitement,

39:44.325 --> 39:45.325
some fucking passion.

39:46.845 --> 39:51.925
But that is what you do.
It's part of being in a partnership,

39:52.005 --> 39:54.005
you shut the door on all that shit.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.565
You shut it out
because you have committed.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.525
It's what a commitment is.

40:05.845 --> 40:08.325
Oh, God.
If something's going on, I just...

40:08.925 --> 40:09.925
I just want to know.

40:10.925 --> 40:14.725
I'll deal with it how I deal with it.
I just have to know.

40:21.965 --> 40:23.685
Nothing is going on.

40:26.005 --> 40:27.205
I promise.

40:29.965 --> 40:31.285
I swear.

40:37.525 --> 40:40.245
One chocolate bombe.

40:40.325 --> 40:42.445
And two spoons.

40:43.845 --> 40:44.965
Enjoy.

40:46.245 --> 40:49.445
That's it. That's good.

41:01.725 --> 41:02.805
Sorry.

41:06.485 --> 41:08.005
I'm not gonna get there.

41:11.165 --> 41:12.885
You're worrying about your work again?

41:15.725 --> 41:16.965
I think so.

41:19.365 --> 41:20.405
OK.

41:26.525 --> 41:28.205
Mind if I finish myself off?

41:32.685 --> 41:33.885
Mm.

42:44.845 --> 42:48.285
Hold on. Excuse me, I gotta take this.

42:50.005 --> 42:51.165
Hello.

42:52.445 --> 42:53.485
Hey.

42:56.365 --> 42:57.365
Whoa, what do you mean?

42:57.445 --> 43:00.805
It means I can't do it anymore.
It's not fair to Theo.

43:00.885 --> 43:04.325
But it's not cheating.
It's not real.

43:04.405 --> 43:07.965
It's like... porn or something.

43:08.045 --> 43:10.165
<i>Come on, man, you know it ain't right.</i>

43:11.045 --> 43:13.525
- I gotta think of Theo.
<i>- OK. But...</i>

43:13.605 --> 43:15.205
we don't have to completely cut it off.

43:15.285 --> 43:18.725
What about, like, first Sunday
of each month?

43:18.805 --> 43:20.805
- No.
- Just now and then.

43:20.885 --> 43:23.445
Karl, it has to stop. Clean break.

43:23.525 --> 43:26.485
Come on. This is good. This is good.
You know it is.

43:26.565 --> 43:28.005
Look, I gotta go.

43:29.165 --> 43:31.005
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Danny.</i>

43:31.885 --> 43:34.005
- Goodbye.
<i>- Danny.</i>

44:13.365 --> 44:16.445
I gotta get past you, you ready?
Go.

44:19.045 --> 44:19.965
All right.

44:23.805 --> 44:24.805
You win.

44:53.085 --> 44:55.005
And he is down.

44:55.085 --> 44:58.485
- Macaroo found that shoe again, huh?
- And put it in a tree.

45:06.125 --> 45:07.645
Happy birthday.

45:07.725 --> 45:11.325
- Oh!
- Sorry it's not much. I couldn't get out.

45:11.405 --> 45:14.525
It's exactly what I wanted.

45:14.605 --> 45:15.645
Thank you.

45:17.325 --> 45:18.445
That smells good.

45:18.525 --> 45:21.685
It's the sort of red-meat caveman food
you like.

45:21.765 --> 45:24.445
- Yeah. That's a hell of a serving size.
- Yeah.

45:24.525 --> 45:25.925
You having your hunger pangs again?

45:28.245 --> 45:30.845
- There's three of us eating tonight.
- I know, that's what I said.

45:30.925 --> 45:33.965
I mean, three adults. I invited Karl over.

45:35.765 --> 45:37.365
Surprise.

45:39.525 --> 45:40.405
Karl?

45:40.485 --> 45:43.685
Yeah, well, last year
you said you hardly got to see him.

45:43.765 --> 45:46.005
You didn't get to speak to him
at that barbecue we had.

45:46.085 --> 45:47.565
So I emailed him last week.

45:48.965 --> 45:50.205
And what did he say?

45:50.285 --> 45:52.405
He said he was looking forward to it.

45:56.485 --> 45:57.765
Speak of the devil.

46:06.245 --> 46:08.445
<i> Oh, my God,</i>
<i>you remember that crazy dude</i>

46:08.525 --> 46:11.125
<i>that lived downstairs</i>
<i>when we were at Madeley?</i>

46:11.205 --> 46:13.965
<i>He used to bang on the ceiling</i>
<i>when we played the music.</i>

46:14.045 --> 46:15.885
He had a point, though,
because we were loud.

46:15.965 --> 46:17.125
Mm-hmm.

46:20.725 --> 46:23.125
Baby, you remember the time
that you got that molly

46:23.565 --> 46:26.405
and you insisted that we all take it?

46:26.485 --> 46:28.685
I had to go to work the next day.

46:28.965 --> 46:32.485
Lord. We were young, I guess.

46:33.245 --> 46:34.205
Well.

46:35.885 --> 46:39.045
Hennessey and dessert
is as crazy as it gets now.

46:41.605 --> 46:43.965
Speaking of dessert, it's almost ready.

46:54.925 --> 46:56.405
What the fuck are you doing?

46:57.525 --> 47:00.405
- Just eating.
- That's not what I mean, OK?

47:01.245 --> 47:02.285
Why the fuck did you come?

47:02.365 --> 47:04.245
She asked me to come.
What do you want me to say?

47:04.325 --> 47:05.565
- An excuse.
- Such as what?

47:05.645 --> 47:07.285
Such as anything.

47:09.605 --> 47:11.685
What am I? Your ex-wife or something?

47:11.765 --> 47:13.445
Look, it's too strange, OK?

47:14.445 --> 47:16.285
It's just too fucking strange.

47:24.565 --> 47:26.005
I'll tell you what's strange.

47:32.245 --> 47:35.245
Nothing matches it, does it?

47:37.085 --> 47:41.205
I tried replacing it, man. I tried.

47:42.405 --> 47:44.565
I tried fucking
the computer-controlled characters.

47:44.645 --> 47:46.045
- It's bullshit.
- Shut up.

47:46.125 --> 47:48.485
It's like a rubber doll.
Not programmed for any sex stuff.

47:48.565 --> 47:49.765
They just sort of lie there.

47:51.885 --> 47:53.245
I tried it with real players.

47:54.805 --> 47:56.925
Other folks controlling Lance.

47:58.045 --> 47:59.605
There was this one guy from Holland.

47:59.685 --> 48:03.365
He was kind of halfway OK as long as
I didn't think about this accent.

48:03.445 --> 48:06.205
But it didn't get me.

48:08.005 --> 48:10.845
It didn't get me,
not like when we're in there. You and me.

48:12.965 --> 48:14.125
Stop it.

48:14.805 --> 48:16.285
I tried everything.

48:18.245 --> 48:20.565
I've gone in there as guy players,
girl players,

48:20.645 --> 48:23.045
multi-player gangbangs, you name it.

48:24.125 --> 48:26.605
You know, I even fucked Tundra,
the polar bear character.

48:29.805 --> 48:33.805
I fucked a polar bear and I still
couldn't get you out of my mind.

48:33.885 --> 48:34.885
I can't help you.

48:34.965 --> 48:36.365
You want to fuck Roxi again.

48:36.445 --> 48:37.645
- I don't.
- You do.

48:38.805 --> 48:40.885
- Just...
- The best sex of my life.

48:42.605 --> 48:45.285
Best of yours too.
Fucking transcendent. You know it was.

48:48.245 --> 48:49.285
Think about it.

48:51.445 --> 48:55.245
Think about her. Roxi.

48:56.165 --> 49:00.925
Holding her, her warm skin against yours.

49:01.005 --> 49:04.045
- Please.
- Her tight wet pussy.

49:04.125 --> 49:06.965
- Fuck, man.
- She'll be in there at midnight.

49:07.765 --> 49:10.365
Just come on in one last time.
You know you want to. One last time.

49:16.005 --> 49:17.605
What y'all doing?

49:20.725 --> 49:23.365
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit, yeah.

49:23.445 --> 49:24.645
That looks good.

49:27.445 --> 49:28.645
Baby, your plate.

49:35.485 --> 49:38.685
- Is that your tiramisu?
- Mm-hmm. You know it.

49:39.765 --> 49:41.365
World famous.

49:41.445 --> 49:43.045
Good to see you.

49:51.285 --> 49:53.965
Happy birthday, man.
It was good to see you.

49:54.045 --> 49:55.405
Yeah, you, too.

49:55.965 --> 49:57.405
Lord, hug each other.

50:00.005 --> 50:02.005
Guys can be so awkward.

50:03.485 --> 50:04.685
Midnight.

50:10.285 --> 50:11.645
- Bye.
- Good night.

51:48.405 --> 51:49.485
I love this.

51:57.165 --> 51:58.365
I love you.

52:05.845 --> 52:06.885
No.

52:09.085 --> 52:10.085
No.

52:12.165 --> 52:14.285
No. No!

52:20.405 --> 52:24.925
- I don't know where that came from.
- Where the fuck does this go?

52:33.165 --> 52:34.765
You're feeling it, too.

52:35.845 --> 52:37.005
Just say it.

52:39.085 --> 52:40.165
Say it.

52:42.285 --> 52:43.605
What the fuck do you want?

52:46.485 --> 52:47.605
Where does this end?

52:48.325 --> 52:49.765
Who says it has to end?

52:50.965 --> 52:51.965
Huh?

53:09.405 --> 53:11.645
- You remember the Year Club?
- Danny.

53:11.725 --> 53:12.965
The old club, the Year.

53:13.045 --> 53:14.245
Of course I do, why?

53:14.325 --> 53:17.965
Car lot out back.
Meet me there in 30 minutes.

53:19.965 --> 53:21.045
Exit game.

54:01.845 --> 54:03.805
- OK.
- We're not gonna fight.

54:04.885 --> 54:05.765
We're gonna kiss.

54:06.645 --> 54:07.565
Kiss?

54:07.645 --> 54:09.405
Like... kiss.

54:10.405 --> 54:11.765
It's the only way. We gotta know.

54:12.485 --> 54:13.365
Know...

54:13.445 --> 54:20.365
If there are fireworks, then, OK, bam,
it's an "us" thing, whatever.

54:20.445 --> 54:22.245
At least we've got a foothold on it.

54:23.765 --> 54:24.925
So let's just fucking kiss.

54:26.885 --> 54:27.925
OK.

54:32.285 --> 54:33.365
I said OK.

54:33.445 --> 54:34.485
I'm working up to it.

54:37.365 --> 54:39.085
- You want me to start?
- I don't know.

54:42.445 --> 54:43.485
Yeah.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.365
OK.

54:54.325 --> 54:55.285
You ready?

54:57.605 --> 54:59.365
Just fucking kiss me, man.

55:19.365 --> 55:21.885
Nope. Not a damn thing.

55:24.525 --> 55:25.645
No, me neither.

55:28.685 --> 55:29.645
Huh.

55:30.565 --> 55:31.845
So that settles it.

55:43.365 --> 55:44.845
You know it's different in the game.

55:44.925 --> 55:47.485
No. You got to get that shit
out of your head.

55:47.565 --> 55:48.845
- It ain't coming out.
- No.

55:49.005 --> 55:50.765
- It's burrowed right in there.
- No, fuck you.

55:50.845 --> 55:52.165
Burrowed right in there, man.

55:52.245 --> 55:53.965
- I know it, you know it.
- Hey. Hey.

55:54.885 --> 55:56.325
It's buried in there, huh?

55:57.085 --> 55:59.445
- Maybe we can get rid of it like that.
- Don't push me, man.

55:59.525 --> 56:01.445
- You a big man? What you gonna do?
- Don't push me.

56:01.525 --> 56:02.685
What you gonna do?

56:05.525 --> 56:06.565
OK.

56:09.045 --> 56:10.005
Stop.

56:13.965 --> 56:16.125
Stop! Stop!

56:34.045 --> 56:40.605
- My husband's here. Danny, Daniel Parker.
- Daniel Parker. Yeah.

56:55.405 --> 56:57.445
I knew y'all were mad at each other
over dinner.

57:02.285 --> 57:04.125
So, what were you fighting about?

57:13.085 --> 57:14.085
Hello?

57:17.685 --> 57:18.925
Holy fuck!

57:20.325 --> 57:21.565
Talk to me.

57:39.485 --> 57:41.085
You guys, bring the kids in.

57:43.325 --> 57:44.245
Hey.

57:46.805 --> 57:48.205
You guys make great babies.

57:48.285 --> 57:50.725
- Ours look like a mile of bad road.
- What?

57:50.805 --> 57:52.365
