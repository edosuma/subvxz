00:05.989 --> 00:08.392
(screaming):
No! No!

00:08.525 --> 00:10.860
KHADIJAH:
I want that motherfucker
Leon dead.

00:10.994 --> 00:13.897
Tianna my blood, too.
We'll make sure them niggas pay.

00:14.030 --> 00:16.333
We need you to take the rap
on this one, Fatback.

00:16.466 --> 00:17.567
PRENTICE:
Franklin, did you post his bai?

00:17.701 --> 00:19.569
No. No, no, no, no.

00:19.703 --> 00:21.971
Well, if you didn't, who did?

00:22.139 --> 00:24.408
LEON:
We looked him in his face
and told him everything

00:24.541 --> 00:25.809
was gonna be all right!

00:25.975 --> 00:28.044
You fucking full of shit!

00:28.178 --> 00:30.580
Contra forces in the south
have been pushed back.

00:30.714 --> 00:32.549
Any word on that missing
shipment of weapons?

00:32.682 --> 00:34.184
TEDDY: I think I have to go
down there. Panama.

00:34.318 --> 00:35.885
Maybe Nicaragua.
You take care of things

00:36.019 --> 00:37.754
for me here until I get back.

00:37.887 --> 00:40.390
-(both laugh)
-JEROME: You're about
to get these people

00:40.524 --> 00:41.758
killed or make them
into killers.

00:41.891 --> 00:43.260
We got in this game
to get rich, right?

00:43.393 --> 00:44.994
The fuck else you need?

00:45.162 --> 00:47.831
It's not just about what I need.

00:47.997 --> 00:50.200
Reed Thompson is CIA.

00:50.334 --> 00:51.868
JEROME:
Mean Franklin in his pocket.

00:52.001 --> 00:54.571
Means we all in his pocket.

00:54.704 --> 00:56.240
Should I tell them
the shelter is being funded

00:56.373 --> 00:57.507
by your son's drug money?

00:57.641 --> 00:59.243
I've got proof
of everything, Alton.

00:59.376 --> 01:00.944
I've also got proof
about who's really behind it.

01:01.077 --> 01:04.148
Tell me what you know,
and I'll spare your family.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.617
LOUIE:
And what'd you do with the bod?

01:07.751 --> 01:09.719
FRANKLIN:
Had Tanosse call it in.

01:09.853 --> 01:12.389
Whoa, hold up.
The cops was at the club?

01:12.522 --> 01:14.758
She said the owner's
out of town.

01:14.891 --> 01:16.760
She just runs the place,
don't know shit.

01:16.893 --> 01:18.695
Which is pretty much
close to the truth.

01:18.828 --> 01:19.896
LOUIE:
All them keys...

01:20.029 --> 01:22.666
I'd moved them.
Like I said I would.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.802
-It's all good.
-All good, except for Skully

01:25.935 --> 01:28.572
dropping bodies
outside my fucking club!

01:28.705 --> 01:31.141
Just one body.

01:31.275 --> 01:32.876
FRANKLIN:
Hey.

01:33.042 --> 01:37.614
Nobody wanted this
to happen, but it worked.

01:37.747 --> 01:40.450
Cops got they fall guy.

01:40.584 --> 01:43.920
Tianna's murder's off the board.
Heat coming off us.

01:45.121 --> 01:46.756
Y'all got Little Rock going.

01:47.791 --> 01:49.926
Leon's gonna restart
the projects.

01:50.059 --> 01:51.761
Get the money
flowing in again, Lou.

01:51.895 --> 01:53.597
Bring in new soldiers.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.432
Protect what's ours.

01:55.565 --> 01:57.234
Huh?

01:57.401 --> 01:59.769
Yeah. All right, come on,
we gonna be late.

01:59.903 --> 02:02.038
(grunts)

02:03.973 --> 02:05.975
Hey.

02:06.109 --> 02:09.413
-Uh, you all right?
-Fine.

02:09.546 --> 02:11.014
(door opens)

02:11.147 --> 02:12.582
Hey, no disrespect to your pops,

02:12.716 --> 02:14.184
but I'm not exactly
in a partying mood.

02:14.318 --> 02:16.186
-(pager beeping)
-(door closes)

02:16.320 --> 02:18.855
All right, man,
I feel you. Hit you later.

02:18.988 --> 02:20.457
All right.

02:22.592 --> 02:24.228
(door opens)

02:26.230 --> 02:28.465
(door closes)

02:28.598 --> 02:30.600
(siren wailing,
dog barking in distance)

02:34.838 --> 02:36.706
(man coughing)

02:36.840 --> 02:38.942
(muttering indistinctly)

02:51.621 --> 02:53.657
* *

03:07.103 --> 03:10.674
* *

03:10.807 --> 03:12.842
(keys jingling)

03:16.546 --> 03:19.316
(disco music playing inside)

03:19.449 --> 03:21.318
* It's called the sweep... *

03:21.451 --> 03:23.520
-Congratulations!
-Hey, congratulations, Pop!

03:23.653 --> 03:25.655
-(laughter)
-FRANKLIN: Yeah!

03:25.789 --> 03:27.090
-(whooping)
-Finally.

03:27.223 --> 03:28.325
-JEROME: Yeah.
-CISSY: Come here.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.327
Don't just stand there. Come on.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.028
-Congratulations, Pop.
-CISSY: Come on in.

03:32.161 --> 03:33.897
-ALTON: Thank you, son.
-(laughter)

03:34.030 --> 03:35.999
-LOUIE: My God. Hey...
-ALTON: Thank you.

03:36.132 --> 03:39.002
-FRANKLIN: Now,
Mama tried her best.
-Yes!

03:39.168 --> 03:40.404
FRANKLIN:
You know how that
be working out.

03:40.537 --> 03:42.005
ALTON:
Oh, she did all right,
didn't she?

03:42.171 --> 03:43.840
-LOUIE: Mmm.
-(overlapping chatter)

03:44.007 --> 03:45.842
JEROME:
I'll get you a drink.
Let me get you a drink.

03:46.009 --> 03:48.011
-FRANKLIN: You want a Hennessy?
-CISSY: Franklin!
-ALTON: Just water.

03:48.177 --> 03:49.913
-(laughter)
-CISSY: Franklin,
that was not funny.

03:50.046 --> 03:52.349
-LOUIE:
Franklin, would you stop that...
-(cork pops)

03:52.516 --> 03:53.750
(laughter, whooping)

03:53.883 --> 03:56.185
-(cheering)
-(overlapping chatter)

03:56.353 --> 03:57.387
(Franklin laughs)

03:57.521 --> 03:58.922
ALTON:
Thank you.

03:59.055 --> 04:02.125
CISSY:
Alton and I used to
talk about everything

04:02.258 --> 04:04.694
when we first met. Hmm?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.963
Uh, the Panther movement,
of course.

04:07.096 --> 04:08.865
Cop-watching in Oakland.

04:08.998 --> 04:13.570
But also just
life, death, God...

04:13.703 --> 04:16.573
-(chuckles) Even the Bible.
-Ah...

04:16.706 --> 04:18.274
Come, now. Don't nobody want
to talk about the old days.

04:18.408 --> 04:20.610
Sure, we do.
Sure, we do.

04:20.744 --> 04:23.580
CISSY:
Your father was
an amateur Bible scholar.

04:23.713 --> 04:25.114
(laughs)

04:25.248 --> 04:27.150
He knew all the problems

04:27.283 --> 04:28.552
of the Old
and the New Testament,

04:28.685 --> 04:30.887
especially the mistakes.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.723
-Mm-hmm. Drove my parents crazy.
-(laughter)

04:33.857 --> 04:36.593
-Mama would not have
liked him one bit.
-JEROME: Oh, no.

04:36.726 --> 04:38.628
She would've pulled out her .38
and blasted his blasphemous ass.

04:38.762 --> 04:40.430
-(laughter)
-LOUIE: I don't want to know

04:40.564 --> 04:42.732
what your mama would've
thought about me, then.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.300
Sure don't.

04:44.434 --> 04:47.671
Uh, we should, uh, make a toast.

04:47.804 --> 04:52.141
-Oh.
-A water toast to, um,
the Bible breaker.

04:52.275 --> 04:53.743
A revolutionary from the start.

04:53.910 --> 04:56.145
We are all very proud of you.

04:56.279 --> 04:58.948
-Uh, thank you.
-We love you.

04:59.082 --> 05:00.350
-To Alton.
-To Alton.

05:00.484 --> 05:01.585
-To Alton.
-Alton. Alton.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.752
OBIAGELI:
Good morning.

05:02.919 --> 05:05.655
That's it. We're wheels up.

05:05.789 --> 05:07.190
Yes, sir.

05:07.323 --> 05:09.192
(indistinct radio chatter)

05:09.325 --> 05:11.395
(door closes)

05:13.397 --> 05:15.432
(sniffles)

05:15.599 --> 05:18.001
Drink?

05:18.134 --> 05:19.636
TEDDY:
You got anything else?

05:19.769 --> 05:22.639
-Something stronger maybe?
-Uh, I'm not sure.

05:22.772 --> 05:25.008
(sighs)
Forget it.

05:28.778 --> 05:30.814
(turbine whirring)

05:33.750 --> 05:35.419
(grunts)

05:36.352 --> 05:38.422
What's going on?

05:46.129 --> 05:48.231
ALTON:
Uh, breakfast will be served

05:48.364 --> 05:50.734
in 30 minutes, but everyone
needs to check in first

05:50.867 --> 05:53.403
at the front desk. All right?

05:53.537 --> 05:55.004
Ah. Wanda.

05:56.973 --> 06:00.544
-Uh, how you doing?
-Doing good.

06:00.677 --> 06:03.146
Okay, well, you get a chance
to look at the new job listings?

06:03.312 --> 06:05.314
Gonna do that first thing.

06:05.482 --> 06:08.317
Oh, come on. Don't wait, Wanda.

06:08.485 --> 06:10.153
-Hey.
-Hmm?

06:12.121 --> 06:14.090
I asked around.

06:14.223 --> 06:16.059
You're Franklin Saint's
daddy, huh?

06:16.192 --> 06:18.227
I am.

06:19.663 --> 06:21.831
How do you know my son?

06:21.965 --> 06:25.535
Oh, you know,
just from the neighborhood.

06:25.669 --> 06:27.704
(baby crying)

06:32.909 --> 06:35.244
-(baby crying loudly)
-MAN: Whose baby is that?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.217
Oh, that's John Baxter's
little girl.

06:41.350 --> 06:44.020
Hey, hey.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.824
Come on. Come here, sweetie.

06:49.759 --> 06:52.862
It's okay. That's okay.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.464
(shushes)

06:54.598 --> 06:58.267
It's okay. Hey-- Uh,
have you seen John Baxter?

06:58.401 --> 07:01.370
-I'll go look for him.
-Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.873
No, no. No.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.308
Okay.

07:05.441 --> 07:07.511
(continues crying)

07:10.413 --> 07:12.448
(shushing)

07:14.250 --> 07:16.285
Let me see if I can find him.

07:18.221 --> 07:20.256
Have you seen John Baxter?

07:24.293 --> 07:26.229
(rapid footsteps)

07:26.395 --> 07:27.631
Hey...

07:30.934 --> 07:33.803
(grunts)
John Baxter?!

07:33.937 --> 07:35.371
(siren wailing)

07:41.477 --> 07:44.347
Oh, John-- Oh.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.950
Man's got the Froze.

07:47.083 --> 07:49.385
Run inside, tell them
to call an ambulance.

07:51.788 --> 07:53.823
(exhales)

08:02.932 --> 08:04.934
(panting)

08:16.613 --> 08:17.947
* Here we go, here we go,
get loose Ski, yeah... *

08:18.081 --> 08:19.783
-Shit.
-FRANKLIN: What's the matter?

08:19.949 --> 08:22.952
PEACHES:
I think we're being followed.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.520
FRANKLIN:
Think or you know?

08:24.654 --> 08:26.690
PEACHES:
I know.

08:26.823 --> 08:28.725
* Ready to go, here we go,
here we go... *

08:28.858 --> 08:30.560
FRANKLIN:
How long?

08:30.694 --> 08:32.896
PEACHES:
A few miles back, at least.

08:33.029 --> 08:35.632
-FRANKLIN: They pros?
-Don't think so.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.301
* Mm, bop, bop, bop, bop,
mm, bop, bop, bop, bop... *

08:38.434 --> 08:40.670
FRANKLIN:
Pull over. Let's find out.

08:40.804 --> 08:42.038
* And we guarantee... *

08:48.645 --> 08:50.013
(gun clicks)

08:55.384 --> 08:57.520
-Hey, what you
motherfuckers want?
-(tires screeching)

09:05.228 --> 09:06.696
-(mutters)
-Hold up.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.832
Huh?

09:08.998 --> 09:12.401
Already missed a drop. I don't
want to miss another one.

09:12.535 --> 09:15.605
You don't want to know
who following us?

09:15.739 --> 09:18.341
Dudes were Black, right?

09:18.474 --> 09:21.077
-Yeah.
-They probably been following us

09:21.210 --> 09:23.479
since we left
the club just now, yeah?

09:24.513 --> 09:26.015
Probably. Right.

09:28.017 --> 09:31.087
If they wanted to jack us,
they would've tried.

09:31.220 --> 09:33.857
Means they wanted to follow us,

09:33.990 --> 09:37.326
like they know we was
about to go meet the plug.

09:40.930 --> 09:42.699
Let's go make this deal.

09:42.866 --> 09:44.834
I'll worry about
the rest of it after.

09:50.774 --> 09:53.609
There was another addict
who ran away.

09:53.743 --> 09:56.545
Probably just another rockhead
stealing whatever he could.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.215
We're seeing more and more
of them die like this.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.118
The-the rock pushes its way
through the weakened heart,

10:02.251 --> 10:03.687
causing cardiac arrest.

10:05.588 --> 10:07.657
ODESSA:
That's the son?

10:07.791 --> 10:09.425
ALTON:
Uh, yeah.

10:09.558 --> 10:12.261
-Where's the mother?
-Missing for over a month.

10:12.395 --> 10:14.130
Also on the rock.

10:14.263 --> 10:17.100
We can check our records,
see if she's been picked up.

10:17.233 --> 10:20.837
In any event, she won't likely
be fit for custody.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.906
What'll happen to them?

10:23.907 --> 10:26.009
We'll search for relatives.

10:26.142 --> 10:28.444
Meantime, Family and Children
Services will look out for them.

10:28.577 --> 10:31.314
-Temporary foster home.
-And if you don't
find relatives?

10:31.447 --> 10:33.149
We'll look
for permanent placement.

10:33.282 --> 10:36.285
But they'll stay together?

10:36.419 --> 10:38.421
For now.

10:38.587 --> 10:41.490
Do you want to talk
to the boy, or should I?

10:41.624 --> 10:44.460
No, I'll, uh...

10:44.593 --> 10:47.864
I'll tell him. Thank you.

10:47.997 --> 10:49.465
-(hip-hop music playing)
-You got to make the time, girl.

10:49.598 --> 10:51.167
Hey. I mean, come on.

10:51.300 --> 10:53.269
RENNY:
Shit changed since y'all left.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.972
-You only got one family.
-What are you talking about?

10:56.105 --> 10:59.308
-Washers been broke
for a while now.
-MAN: All right, come on.

10:59.442 --> 11:03.179
-There's a lot more
little homies around.
-(scoffs)

11:03.312 --> 11:05.782
Niggas trying to eat
any way they can, Lee.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.017
WOMAN:
Get your hands off of me.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.219
RENNY:
Big Deon.

11:10.353 --> 11:12.455
Fatback and him was cousins.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.024
So you know he's been
looking for you.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.228
MAN (in distance):
Hey, Little Ron! Hey, don't get

11:19.362 --> 11:21.030
my bike jacked, dude.

11:24.801 --> 11:28.404
DEON:
Fatback wasn't no gangsta,
but he was a real one.

11:28.537 --> 11:32.508
He took care of the homies,
unlike your motherfucking ass.

11:32.641 --> 11:35.678
That's why I came here
to make shit right.

11:35.812 --> 11:38.247
Do business.
Just name your price.

11:38.381 --> 11:41.050
(scoffs)
Price?

11:41.184 --> 11:42.752
You hear, cuh?

11:42.886 --> 11:46.890
Nigga, you left mouths to feed
and no bread.

11:47.023 --> 11:49.025
Nigga, fuck you.

11:53.830 --> 11:56.432
You feeling froggy?

11:56.565 --> 11:58.701
-Leap, nigga.
-RENNY: Nigga.

12:00.736 --> 12:02.806
I've been itching
to max a nigga out.

12:05.474 --> 12:08.878
I ain't come here for beef,
just business.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.115
Well, beef looking
for you, then,

12:12.248 --> 12:14.417
'cause ain't gonna be
no business, cuh.

12:17.686 --> 12:19.722
Come on, let's go.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.060
DEON: Take your Jheri curl ass
on out of here, nigga.

12:24.193 --> 12:25.528
MAN:
Run, little man.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.797
-Step, motherfucker.
-(others laughing, murmuring)

12:27.931 --> 12:29.398
Come on.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.569
Old-school nigga
really trying to squab.

12:33.702 --> 12:35.939
It's only a few more
left like that.

12:37.773 --> 12:40.409
FRANKLIN:
(sighs) So, where is Reed today?

12:40.543 --> 12:42.411
Had some other business.

12:42.545 --> 12:44.147
(railroad crossing bell clanging
in distance)

12:44.280 --> 12:45.381
(train horn blowing in distance)

12:45.548 --> 12:47.550
He seem okay to you?

12:51.754 --> 12:54.257
You know, he came to see me
the other night at the club.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.893
He was drunk, sniffling,
like he might've been using.

12:57.961 --> 12:59.762
If something's
going on with him,

12:59.896 --> 13:03.032
it's in both our interests
to know, don't you think?

13:04.033 --> 13:06.135
If you want to know,
you should ask him.

13:06.269 --> 13:07.803
Well, I hope to.

13:07.937 --> 13:09.705
But he ain't here.

13:11.607 --> 13:13.242
He's okay.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.411
Don't worry.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.347
(vehicle door opens)

13:18.481 --> 13:20.116
(sighs)

13:20.249 --> 13:21.417
(vehicle door closes)

13:23.086 --> 13:25.254
CISSY:
I am so sorry.

13:32.128 --> 13:35.331
Most families don't want
to adopt two kids.

13:36.665 --> 13:38.667
Especially a teen.

13:40.103 --> 13:42.671
The boy will be
taken to a facility?

13:47.110 --> 13:49.278
I hope not.

13:51.447 --> 13:55.151
Can you imagine being split
from your baby sister like that?

13:59.155 --> 14:01.290
Can we do anything?

14:02.491 --> 14:04.360
Yes.

14:07.496 --> 14:11.334
We can stop all of this.

14:17.873 --> 14:20.009
-The plan was two years.
-No.

14:20.143 --> 14:22.578
-We talked about this.
-No. And if you believe that,

14:22.711 --> 14:24.847
then you're drinking
the Kool-Aid.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.317
What do you want to do?

14:28.451 --> 14:31.487
I want him to walk away.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.358
I'm not abandoning my son again.

14:38.194 --> 14:40.063
-Cissy. Cissy.
-(grunts)

14:40.196 --> 14:41.564
(chuckles nervously)

14:41.697 --> 14:46.335
If you can get Franklin
to agree, we'll be out.

14:46.502 --> 14:47.903
But if not...

14:49.372 --> 14:50.539
C-Cissy...

14:50.673 --> 14:51.941
-I can't.
-No, wait, wait, wait.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.243
-I can't.
-Cissy, Cissy.
Listen to me, Cissy.

15:06.855 --> 15:08.191
(sniffs)

15:11.594 --> 15:13.262
Aren't you gonna share?

15:17.366 --> 15:18.767
(sniffs)

15:22.038 --> 15:24.940
You know... (sniffs)

15:25.074 --> 15:28.111
as much as I am
a great believer in the...

15:28.244 --> 15:31.114
medicinal qualities
of the coca plant...

15:32.215 --> 15:34.950
(snorts, sighs)

15:35.951 --> 15:37.120
(sniffs)

15:38.087 --> 15:40.756
...I can't say I endorse this
as a method of coping.

15:40.889 --> 15:42.058
Well, who says I'm coping?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.760
Maybe I'm just doing
my best Avi impression.

15:46.429 --> 15:49.332
It's not an easy job,
what we do.

15:49.465 --> 15:51.100
What we do?

15:52.901 --> 15:55.238
I wasn't that much different
than you once, remember?

15:55.404 --> 15:57.573
I recall a time
when I used to work

15:57.740 --> 16:01.510
with a certain
government agency in Israel,

16:01.644 --> 16:07.250
and I experienced
occupational burnout.

16:08.551 --> 16:13.422
Then, in '72,
I really messed up.

16:13.556 --> 16:14.990
In '72?

16:18.661 --> 16:19.928
Abu Sharif?

16:20.096 --> 16:22.665
(quietly):
Yeah.

16:22.798 --> 16:25.834
No shit.
You put the bomb in the book?

16:25.968 --> 16:28.104
The Memoirs of Che Guevara?

16:28.237 --> 16:30.005
(laughs)

16:30.139 --> 16:32.141
-Mossad was to blame.
-Shit.

16:32.275 --> 16:34.277
Made to look incompetent.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.011
International condemnation.

16:36.145 --> 16:38.314
Some of us were
pretty damn impressed.

16:38.447 --> 16:40.015
Not my superiors.

16:40.149 --> 16:42.285
They distanced themselves
from me.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.719
The writing was on the wall.

16:43.852 --> 16:46.355
It was over.
I just refused to quit.

16:47.790 --> 16:53.429
I put myself through
so much unnecessary anguish...

16:55.431 --> 16:57.700
...when I should've
just walked away.

16:58.801 --> 17:00.403
So, what was the last straw?

17:00.536 --> 17:02.471
The day they told me
I was leaving.

17:02.638 --> 17:06.875
It was up to me to choose
which way I left.

17:08.877 --> 17:11.580
Walking or being carried.

17:11.714 --> 17:14.383
(laughs)

17:18.053 --> 17:20.055
BLACK DIAMOND:
That's right.

17:20.189 --> 17:22.091
Leon's in here.

17:22.225 --> 17:25.228
All ones, please and thank you.

17:25.361 --> 17:26.762
Hold the fuck up.

17:26.895 --> 17:28.764
Why are some hos bringing me
this nigga dead body?

17:28.897 --> 17:30.333
Ain't no hos around here.

17:30.499 --> 17:33.769
The hit you and your sister
put on the Saint crew. Duh.

17:33.902 --> 17:37.506
Five grand for Leon, right?

17:37.640 --> 17:39.275
DALLAS:
Don't act dumb now.

17:39.408 --> 17:41.710
Your sister put that shit
out on the street,

17:41.844 --> 17:43.712
now we about to get paid.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.756
Is you bitches stupid?

17:55.023 --> 17:57.893
-That ain't Leon.
-What?

17:58.026 --> 18:00.296
Take this shit
and get the fuck out of here.

18:00.429 --> 18:01.730
Uh-uh-- nuh-uh.
We did a lot of work

18:01.864 --> 18:03.366
to set this motherfucker up
and drug him.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.933
Yeah, I broke my nails
putting him in the trunk, so...

18:05.067 --> 18:06.269
Come on.

18:07.703 --> 18:09.705
How about four grand?

18:11.106 --> 18:13.176
Okay. Three grand?

18:14.343 --> 18:17.713
Uh, we got babysitters
for this. $500?

18:19.582 --> 18:21.617
Get the fuck out of here.

18:27.456 --> 18:29.392
LOUIE:
Franklin gone for the day.

18:29.558 --> 18:32.561
I ain't here for him.
Hey, Jerome?

18:32.695 --> 18:33.829
JEROME:
Yeah?

18:33.962 --> 18:35.130
I got a problem with an O.G.,

18:35.264 --> 18:36.799
and I know you came up
with them type of niggas.

18:36.932 --> 18:38.834
Yeah, they looked out for me
when I first got here.

18:38.967 --> 18:40.836
-Was a while back.
-LEON: Well, I figured

18:40.969 --> 18:42.338
you know a way
around what I'm dealing with,

18:42.471 --> 18:44.139
'cause that nigga
won't even hear me out.

18:44.273 --> 18:45.774
JEROME:
Gangbanging about more
than just money

18:45.908 --> 18:47.142
and colors for O.G.s.

18:47.276 --> 18:49.745
It's about community.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.280
-Respect.
-Well,

18:51.414 --> 18:53.316
this shit ain't Sesame Street.
What am I supposed to do?

18:53.449 --> 18:54.950
Wrap this shit in a box
and hand it to them?

18:55.083 --> 18:57.753
Fatback paid more than just
overhead to his niggas, right?

18:57.886 --> 18:59.622
-Yeah.
-He made sure everybody there,

18:59.755 --> 19:00.956
they got what they needed.

19:01.089 --> 19:03.592
Made them feel like
they was taken care of.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.094
That's your job now.

19:07.263 --> 19:08.931
You got to show them
you're serious.

19:09.097 --> 19:10.566
All right?

19:12.735 --> 19:13.936
I'm-a go with you.

19:16.939 --> 19:18.607
-Okay.
-Yeah.

19:19.608 --> 19:21.109
You really think
this a good time

19:21.277 --> 19:22.945
to be spending hours
in the projects?

19:23.111 --> 19:24.179
You got bodies dropping here.

19:24.313 --> 19:25.881
I feel like it's dangerous
anywhere I go.

19:26.014 --> 19:27.716
Leon got a bull's-eye on him.

19:27.850 --> 19:29.184
Didn't you say
we need to do business

19:29.318 --> 19:31.019
and serve the goddamn CIA man?

19:31.153 --> 19:33.222
Unless you want to go
to the projects

19:33.356 --> 19:35.424
and straighten
this shit out yourself.

19:43.499 --> 19:45.968
KHADIJAH:
Black Diamond and Dallas
are good people.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.970
-You should've paid them.
-Don't you realize

19:48.103 --> 19:50.172
dummies like that
gonna bring you anybody

19:50.306 --> 19:51.707
that look like one
of the Saints?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.909
First, you out here
gutting niggas like you crazy,

19:54.042 --> 19:56.412
now you looking to get
any old body killed.

19:56.545 --> 19:59.181
-What are you thinking, Dijah?
-I'm thinking about my daughter.

19:59.315 --> 20:00.883
And I wouldn't even have to do
none of this shit

20:01.016 --> 20:02.851
had you brought me Leon
in the first fucking place.

20:02.985 --> 20:04.219
Look, I'm-a tell you
one more time, all right?

20:04.353 --> 20:05.554
I'm doing this my way!

20:05.688 --> 20:07.089
Now, I already got stuff
in motion.

20:07.222 --> 20:08.891
I don't need you messing it up.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.828
(scoffs softly)

20:12.961 --> 20:15.264
Well, it take a little bit
of time to call off a hit,

20:15.398 --> 20:19.167
so... might want to hurry
your way of doing shit.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.208
The fuck out of here!

20:27.676 --> 20:29.044
(drink pouring)

20:29.177 --> 20:33.449
* And I feel it deep inside *

20:33.582 --> 20:37.152
-(billiard balls clack)
-* Oh, how much more
can I try? *

20:37.353 --> 20:40.155
* 'Cause I feel it in my bones *

20:40.356 --> 20:43.091
* Causing me to fight
when you say... *

20:43.225 --> 20:44.527
BARTENDER:
What'll it be?

20:46.194 --> 20:48.431
* I won't give up
without a fight... *

20:48.564 --> 20:50.032
Uh...

20:50.198 --> 20:54.269
Think I'll have a, uh...

20:54.403 --> 20:56.505
club soda, please.

21:03.011 --> 21:06.749
* When you give love *

21:06.882 --> 21:11.820
* You forgive
and then you forget *

21:11.954 --> 21:15.658
* But it's real love *

21:15.791 --> 21:20.028
* That is strong and stands out
from the rest *

21:21.029 --> 21:24.132
* Things we say, we may regret *

21:24.266 --> 21:28.270
* In the heat of emotions
we can't resist *

21:28.404 --> 21:31.273
* When I know love
is so easy... *

21:31.407 --> 21:33.576
Ground rules.

21:35.744 --> 21:38.914
You protect my family.

21:39.081 --> 21:41.283
This is only about
exposing the CIA.

21:41.417 --> 21:43.586
Is that clear?

21:43.752 --> 21:45.521
If you agree to be
totally on the record

21:45.654 --> 21:49.758
and not hold anything back,
I promise.

21:52.428 --> 21:54.463
* *

22:01.904 --> 22:03.372
* Brr... stick 'em! *

22:03.506 --> 22:05.340
* *

22:05.474 --> 22:07.109
-JEROME: Come on, eat!
-LEON: Here you go.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.811
-MAN: Thanks, man.
-WANDA: Hey, Lee.

22:08.944 --> 22:10.946
Hey, Wanda.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.148
You looking... not as bad.

22:13.281 --> 22:15.451
Regular fucking
Casanova over here.

22:15.584 --> 22:17.019
I can grab you a plate
if you want.

22:17.152 --> 22:19.054
I need to talk to you.

22:19.187 --> 22:20.689
You ain't been
returning my pages.

22:20.823 --> 22:22.525
I been busy.

22:22.658 --> 22:24.192
I made it to Alton's shelter.

22:24.326 --> 22:25.794
-Okay.
-Uh...

22:25.928 --> 22:27.496
You ain't tell me
he was Franklin's daddy.

22:27.630 --> 22:28.697
JEROME:
How you doing, girl?

22:28.831 --> 22:30.032
I ain't think it mattered.

22:30.165 --> 22:33.001
It didn't, but...

22:33.135 --> 22:34.870
I heard something
while I was there.

22:35.003 --> 22:38.040
He was talking to this
Oriental lady-- Wait, that's

22:38.173 --> 22:39.508
-the proper term
to call them and shit, right?
-I don't know,

22:39.642 --> 22:41.043
but if you got something to say,
spit it the fuck out.

22:41.176 --> 22:44.079
Okay, but first, if it's
something that might could help,

22:44.212 --> 22:46.849
do you think maybe
you could put me on?

22:46.982 --> 22:49.084
I know you ain't come up here
asking for no job.

22:49.217 --> 22:50.519
I'm clean, Lee.

22:50.653 --> 22:52.688
And I'm gonna stay that way.

22:52.821 --> 22:55.558
I just... I need some money.

22:55.691 --> 22:57.893
-Come on, Lee.
-Hey, get the fuck out of here.

22:58.026 --> 22:59.595
-You know I'm...
-Just get the fuck
out of here.

22:59.728 --> 23:01.664
Said there wasn't
gonna be no business.

23:01.830 --> 23:03.732
You see any, nigga?

23:03.866 --> 23:06.535
JEROME:
Hey. You Big Deon, right?

23:06.669 --> 23:09.404
From Pearl's,
off Manchester and Western?

23:10.405 --> 23:12.074
Chris Dickerson people, right?

23:13.041 --> 23:15.210
Yeah. Bench about 350?

23:15.343 --> 23:18.180
Full plates, nigga.

23:18.313 --> 23:20.182
Yeah, Dickerson and them
my folks.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.717
Uh-huh.

23:21.850 --> 23:24.052
Had you pegged
for Mr. Olympia and shit.

23:24.186 --> 23:26.088
You still training?

23:26.221 --> 23:29.592
Knocked a nigga out
for saying I was on them 'roids.

23:29.725 --> 23:31.994
Went to jail.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.131
How you know this nigga?

23:36.264 --> 23:38.400
We in the game together.
Partners.

23:41.704 --> 23:44.072
Sorry about your cousin.

23:46.108 --> 23:47.743
Gonna pay for the funeral.

23:47.876 --> 23:52.447
Take care of them niggas, too.
I promise you that.

23:52.581 --> 23:56.919
As long as your business don't
interfere with my business.

23:57.052 --> 24:00.255
That's all you.

24:00.388 --> 24:02.224
We good if the overhead good.

24:02.357 --> 24:05.393
All right.
We pay you double right now.

24:05.561 --> 24:08.063
Throw in a couple
of your soldiers.

24:15.771 --> 24:19.575
Einstein and his folks got you.
They loyal.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.677
He's the smartest, though.

24:21.810 --> 24:26.114
What's 123,048 times 324?

24:26.248 --> 24:30.786
39,867,552.

24:30.919 --> 24:33.288
What the fuck? I need more
than a human calculator.

24:33.421 --> 24:35.390
You do right by us
and you'll have it.

24:37.492 --> 24:40.162
We die for ours.

24:40.295 --> 24:44.299
Something happening to them,
something happening to you.

24:46.769 --> 24:48.370
Let's eat.

24:48.503 --> 24:50.272
Come on, now.

24:50.438 --> 24:52.174
-Come on.
-Y'all go ahead.

24:52.307 --> 24:53.976
MAN:
Man, I'm hungry.

24:54.109 --> 24:56.144
(indistinct chatter)

24:59.114 --> 25:01.016
JEROME:
Get what you want.

25:01.149 --> 25:02.450
DEON:
Give me all them, shit.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.620
-On one plate, nigga.
-(grill sizzling)

25:04.753 --> 25:06.789
Y'all ain't got
no sauce or nothing.

25:06.955 --> 25:09.792
-Shit looks dry as fuck.
-(laughter)

25:13.261 --> 25:14.863
(dog barking in distance)

25:14.997 --> 25:16.865
Hey, Mama.

25:16.999 --> 25:19.635
Hey, sweetheart.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.303
Damn.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.838
That new?

25:22.971 --> 25:25.808
-It is.
-(chuckles)

25:25.941 --> 25:26.809
Wow.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.144
(groans)
That's good.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.313
You should treat yourself.
You deserve it.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.081
-And I do.
-(chuckles)

25:33.215 --> 25:35.450
So, what's up?

25:36.652 --> 25:38.153
Well...

25:38.286 --> 25:41.757
I had a long talk
with Paul Davis today.

25:41.890 --> 25:44.092
-Uh-huh.
-He wants to bring us in

25:44.226 --> 25:46.328
on two commercial towers
on Wilshire.

25:46.461 --> 25:49.598
(laughs):
That's amazing. That's amazing.

25:49.732 --> 25:51.600
And he just called
out the blue with this?

25:51.734 --> 25:53.568
Mm, I did what you suggested.

25:53.702 --> 25:55.437
I forgave
the church bridge loan.

25:55.570 --> 25:57.773
-Made it a gift.
-A gift. See? See?

25:57.906 --> 26:00.108
(laughs):
That's great.

26:00.242 --> 26:01.509
Wow.

26:02.978 --> 26:05.013
Did you ever think
you'd be in the position

26:05.180 --> 26:07.850
to give away
a quarter million dollars?

26:08.851 --> 26:09.685
No.

26:09.852 --> 26:12.855
-No.
-But I knew you would.

26:15.523 --> 26:16.825
(chuckles softly)

26:18.360 --> 26:19.928
-(laughing)
-That's beautiful.

26:20.062 --> 26:22.297
-Come on, let me sign this.
-Yeah.

26:22.430 --> 26:24.700
Here.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.006
(exhales)

26:39.614 --> 26:42.284
So, you really do live
near the shelter.

26:43.285 --> 26:45.253
How long you been here?

26:45.387 --> 26:47.155
All my life.

26:47.289 --> 26:50.458
-This is my parents' house.
-Hmm.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.896
I have more questions.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.964
I need to clarify a few things.

26:56.098 --> 26:58.100
-That okay?
-(groans)

27:10.979 --> 27:13.048
(sighs):
Okay.

27:14.917 --> 27:16.418
(tape recorder clicks)

27:17.753 --> 27:22.590
Wiesenthal and I just missed
Mengele in Buenos Aires.

27:22.758 --> 27:26.594
They're gonna have
an in absentia trial for him

27:26.762 --> 27:28.430
in Jerusalem next month.

27:28.563 --> 27:32.300
I'll have a lot more freedom
in pursuing him.

27:32.434 --> 27:33.936
There she is.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.437
Hello, darling.

27:35.570 --> 27:36.638
-Querido.
-Querido, mija.

27:36.772 --> 27:39.775
(Avi chuckles, kisses)

27:39.908 --> 27:41.009
Reed.

27:41.143 --> 27:43.111
Marta, my banker.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.713
It's lovely to meet you.

27:44.847 --> 27:46.782
As I said on the phone,
I am terribly sorry

27:46.915 --> 27:48.516
-for the error.
-Well, it's not an error.

27:48.650 --> 27:51.453
It's... it was the theft
of $15 million.

27:51.586 --> 27:52.955
Let's not call it an error.

27:53.088 --> 27:55.457
Listen, there's been progress.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.292
There's been progre...
There's been progress?

27:57.425 --> 27:59.527
I'm sure there has been.

27:59.661 --> 28:00.996
I mean,
especially once you heard

28:01.129 --> 28:03.131
we were coming down here.
Right?

28:03.298 --> 28:06.634
Our security forensic team
tracked the transfers,

28:06.769 --> 28:08.570
discovered it was
one of our employees.

28:08.703 --> 28:10.973
He made it look
as if the escrow transfer

28:11.106 --> 28:13.241
went to Lebanon but was instead

28:13.375 --> 28:15.643
diverted to, bueno,
multiple accounts

28:15.811 --> 28:17.212
-around the world.
-Which employee?

28:17.345 --> 28:18.713
That's an internal matter.

28:18.847 --> 28:19.815
Well, no, it's my money.

28:19.982 --> 28:21.649
We've transferred
$15 million U.S.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.085
into your account.

28:23.218 --> 28:25.153
For all intents and purposes,

28:25.320 --> 28:28.056
-this matter is resolved.
-It makes no sense, actually.

28:28.190 --> 28:30.492
What, so if he stole the money,
why does he stick around?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.727
Bueno, he runs,
he's obviously guilty.

28:32.861 --> 28:35.063
He thought
he could hide the transfers,

28:35.197 --> 28:37.933
-stay above suspicion.
-I'll need to speak to him
personally.

28:38.066 --> 28:39.567
We have
our own enforcement team,

28:39.701 --> 28:42.204
working with
Panamanian authorities.

28:42.337 --> 28:43.939
-(laughs)
-They want to track more
of his transfers

28:44.072 --> 28:45.607
-before taking him in.
-The Panamanian authorities.

28:45.740 --> 28:47.609
What's his name?

28:47.742 --> 28:50.578
I am sorry. No.

28:50.712 --> 28:52.347
No se puede.

28:54.516 --> 28:56.551
(laughs)

28:58.486 --> 29:00.455
(whispers): I think that we're
probably gonna have to revisit

29:00.588 --> 29:03.291
this financial relationship.

29:03.425 --> 29:05.060
-Thank you.
-AVI: Wait, wait,
where you going?

29:05.193 --> 29:07.529
Where you going? What the f...
Hey, what's your problem?

29:07.662 --> 29:10.999
-You got the money.
-My problem is that is
an unsatisfactory answer!

29:12.100 --> 29:13.768
-(crickets chirping)
-(keys jingling)

29:19.842 --> 29:22.878
-(door creaking)
-(dog barking in distance)

29:26.448 --> 29:28.283
(lock clacks)

29:37.059 --> 29:39.061
(footsteps approaching)

29:41.129 --> 29:42.797
CISSY:
Babe?

29:44.132 --> 29:46.501
Where you been?

29:46.634 --> 29:48.803
Shelter said you left hours ago.

29:48.937 --> 29:50.472
Uh...

29:52.407 --> 29:54.609
I was...

29:54.742 --> 29:56.311
thinking.

29:57.479 --> 30:00.515
-Mm.
-(exhales)

30:00.648 --> 30:04.419
I just want you to know
that what I did...

30:05.420 --> 30:08.256
...I did for all of us.

30:23.105 --> 30:25.340
We got to be a unit now,
you hear?

30:25.473 --> 30:27.542
I ain't none
of y'all little niggas' daddy.

30:27.675 --> 30:29.978
So if you off schedule,
you're missing money,

30:30.112 --> 30:32.280
that's your ass.

30:32.447 --> 30:35.817
It's gonna be some times when
you got to get your hands dirty.

30:35.951 --> 30:38.954
You stay ready...

30:39.121 --> 30:40.989
you ain't have to get ready.

30:41.123 --> 30:43.558
Cook house got rats,
but we good.

30:43.691 --> 30:46.128
I want these corners up
by tonight.

30:46.294 --> 30:47.529
They ready.

30:47.662 --> 30:49.297
Where the nerdy nigga at?

30:49.464 --> 30:51.066
Went to take a shit.

30:51.199 --> 30:52.500
Come on.

30:52.634 --> 30:54.502
-All right, cool. Let's go.
-You know your corner?

30:54.636 --> 30:55.703
(indistinct chatter)

30:55.837 --> 30:58.140
Think they got it?

30:58.306 --> 30:59.641
(cocks pistol)

30:59.774 --> 31:01.343
JEROME:
The fuck?

31:03.445 --> 31:05.313
Can I help you, sweetheart?

31:05.447 --> 31:07.482
$5,000 on your head,
dead or alive.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.217
Really need that.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.324
Thwarted, nigga.

31:17.892 --> 31:21.696
Well, how are you gonna collect
when you're dead?

31:21.829 --> 31:22.965
Hmm?

31:27.735 --> 31:29.037
Please.

31:29.171 --> 31:31.239
My mom and dad
have gone off the pipe,

31:31.373 --> 31:32.607
and my sisters hungry and...

31:32.740 --> 31:35.543
-Mm.
-The water's off.

31:41.849 --> 31:43.685
If you need anything,

31:43.851 --> 31:45.420
fuckin' ask.

31:49.924 --> 31:51.293
JEROME:
Uh-uh.

31:51.426 --> 31:53.095
Hell no.

31:59.867 --> 32:02.837
What the fuck else you know
about this bounty?

32:06.608 --> 32:08.376
TEDDY:
Yeah, it's Banco de Panama.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.212
They're running their own
internal investigation.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.813
Just give me his name.

32:11.946 --> 32:13.948
Mm-hmm. And you're sure
that this is in regards

32:14.082 --> 32:16.118
to the escrow account linked
with Lebanon?

32:17.119 --> 32:18.987
Uh, what else?

32:19.121 --> 32:21.256
Any blacklists?

32:21.389 --> 32:24.259
Any connection
with the Sandinistas or the KGB?

32:24.392 --> 32:27.462
The Panamanian ADO?

32:27.595 --> 32:30.532
No, I'll figure it out myself.
Just give me the address.

32:33.435 --> 32:35.103
Great.

32:35.237 --> 32:37.272
(passing siren wailing)

32:39.307 --> 32:41.476
(rhythmic knocking on door)

32:49.484 --> 32:50.952
Going out?

32:51.086 --> 32:53.421
I thought maybe we should have
a drink or something.

32:53.588 --> 32:54.956
Not a good time.

32:55.090 --> 32:56.458
Gonna hit the hay.

32:56.591 --> 32:58.826
-Good night, Avi.
-Listen.

33:00.162 --> 33:03.265
Don't do what I think
you're going to do.

33:03.431 --> 33:05.100
It's gonna be all right.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.701
Listen to me. Hey.

33:06.834 --> 33:08.436
(quietly):
Damn.

33:11.673 --> 33:14.542
Uh, no, thank you. I have
an early morning tomorrow.

33:14.676 --> 33:16.878
(music playing quietly)

33:17.011 --> 33:21.249
Just wanted you to hear it
from me before we publish.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.651
This is the one, Henry.

33:23.785 --> 33:26.821
The story I've been chasing
all these years.

33:26.954 --> 33:29.124
Well, then...

33:29.257 --> 33:30.692
congratulations.

33:33.495 --> 33:34.796
Wow.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.964
-(sets glass down)
-Take it easy.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.634
Not sure I can handle
all this enthusiasm.

33:39.801 --> 33:41.936
I know how hard you've worked.

33:43.004 --> 33:45.840
But I also know
how deeply your anger runs.

33:45.973 --> 33:47.675
My anger?

33:47.809 --> 33:50.145
-What the government did
to you and your family.
-And to yours.

33:50.312 --> 33:52.214
What they've done to people
like us for generations.

33:52.347 --> 33:53.848
Yes, which is
why I'm also afraid

33:53.981 --> 33:57.385
of what they'll do to us if you
expose these kinds of secrets.

33:58.386 --> 33:59.554
I don't know.

33:59.687 --> 34:01.055
But we're not married anymore,

34:01.189 --> 34:03.057
and our daughter lives
across the country

34:03.191 --> 34:04.492
and won't speak to me, so...

34:04.626 --> 34:06.594
my guess is whatever happens
to me, you'll be fine.

34:06.728 --> 34:09.397
No, Irene.
If something happens to you,

34:09.531 --> 34:12.334
-we won't be fine.
-I know what I'm doing.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.735
I can take care of myself.

34:13.868 --> 34:15.337
I brought you here to celebrate,

34:15.470 --> 34:17.172
-for Christ's sake.
-All right, okay, I'm...

34:17.305 --> 34:20.108
I'm sorry.
I-I look forward to reading it.

34:20.242 --> 34:22.877
Fuck. No, I'm sorry. I...

34:25.180 --> 34:29.050
Of course
I-I appreciate your concern.

34:29.184 --> 34:31.919
You're-you're just
looking out for me.

34:33.821 --> 34:36.391
I know I work too much.

34:36.524 --> 34:38.626
I know it hurt our marriage.

34:38.760 --> 34:41.129
I know I wasn't the best mom.

34:41.263 --> 34:43.998
But this is why.

34:51.273 --> 34:52.774
I hear you.

34:53.775 --> 34:55.243
I do.

34:55.377 --> 34:57.779
I hope it goes the way you want.

34:59.714 --> 35:01.783
(door opens)

35:03.751 --> 35:04.786
(door closes)

35:07.121 --> 35:12.527
* My love still lingers on. *

35:14.962 --> 35:16.398
LOUIE:
A bounty?

35:16.531 --> 35:19.567
-On who?!
-FRANKLIN: Everybody connected
to the crew.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.170
Who we got to thank for that?
Fucking Manboy and Skully?

35:22.304 --> 35:23.671
-Probably.
-Chickenshit motherfuckers

35:23.805 --> 35:25.240
couldn't get us,
so they had to pay.

35:25.373 --> 35:26.808
How are we supposed
to run a business

35:26.941 --> 35:28.510
with a fucking bounty
on our heads?

35:28.643 --> 35:30.245
And now we got to worry about
some motherfucker trying

35:30.378 --> 35:31.913
to shoot us every time
we walk out the fucking door?

35:32.046 --> 35:33.748
Was already worried about that.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.817
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

35:35.950 --> 35:38.320
I swear to God, following behind
you dumb motherfuckers is gonna

35:38.453 --> 35:40.488
-be the death of me.
-Well, we can't go spinning
off the rails now.

35:40.622 --> 35:42.524
All right?
We got to stick together.

35:42.657 --> 35:44.392
(knocking, door opens)

35:45.427 --> 35:46.628
What?

35:53.468 --> 35:55.470
FRANKLIN:
What's wrong?

35:56.771 --> 35:59.274
I need to talk to you.

36:12.153 --> 36:14.188
Did you steal my money?

36:15.323 --> 36:17.459
¿Qué pasó? ¿Quién es?

36:17.625 --> 36:20.127
You're Gabriel Jaen.

36:20.295 --> 36:22.564
And you work
for Banco de Panama.

36:22.697 --> 36:23.798
What? I-I don't understand.
Who are you?

36:23.965 --> 36:25.533
Do you work for Banco de Panama?

36:25.667 --> 36:28.035
I just need to know
if you stole my money.

36:28.169 --> 36:30.238
-I didn't steal anything.
-You didn't steal my money?

36:30.372 --> 36:32.374
I don't know what you're
talking about. No, no, no, no!

36:32.507 --> 36:34.542
(screaming)

36:36.478 --> 36:38.513
(moans, panting)

36:49.891 --> 36:52.059
FRANKLIN:
Told Mama she must be mistaken.

36:52.193 --> 36:54.195
That there's no way
you'd actually go off

36:54.329 --> 36:56.063
and do something
this reckless and stupid

36:56.197 --> 36:58.232
without coming to me first.

36:58.366 --> 37:00.167
I'm sorry,
but he needed to know.

37:00.335 --> 37:02.837
ALTON:
Well, the story was gonna break.

37:04.672 --> 37:06.408
At least this way
the CIA takes the fall,

37:06.541 --> 37:07.775
and we get out clean.

37:07.909 --> 37:09.844
And how the hell you gonna
do that, huh?

37:09.977 --> 37:12.246
Run and hide from the damn CIA?

37:12.380 --> 37:15.249
Nehanda Abiodun and Assata
Shakur are in Cuba right now,

37:15.383 --> 37:18.085
-protected and safe.
-What about Jerome,
Louie and Leon?

37:18.219 --> 37:20.021
You want to take everybody
to fucking Cuba?

37:20.154 --> 37:23.024
-If I have to, yes!
-Maybe it won't come to that.

37:23.190 --> 37:25.760
-Maybe there's something
we can do to stop it.
-Oh, yeah. That's right, Mama.

37:25.893 --> 37:27.695
That's right.
Because of the reporter.

37:27.862 --> 37:29.364
You can't stop it.
The story's already out there.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.299
-How you think she got to me?
-She?

37:31.433 --> 37:35.136
-Oh, so it's a woman, then?
-Too many people know, Franklin.

37:35.269 --> 37:36.638
It's only a matter of time.

37:36.771 --> 37:38.440
At least this way
we're ahead of it.

37:38.573 --> 37:40.475
I'm not moving to fucking Cuba,
looking over my damn shoulder.

37:40.608 --> 37:43.378
-This is my fucking home!
-You don't know who
you're dealing with!

37:43.511 --> 37:45.079
You don't even know
his real name!

37:45.212 --> 37:46.948
I know if this story gets out,

37:47.081 --> 37:48.816
then we all fucked.
So, please, come on.

37:48.950 --> 37:50.284
-Just tell me what her name is.
-Don't be so naive, son.

37:50.418 --> 37:51.886
-Tell me her fucking name!
-Oh!

37:52.019 --> 37:53.321
-Franklin!
-Wait a minute!

37:53.455 --> 37:55.457
What? You're gonna shoot me?!

37:57.058 --> 37:59.461
Like you did Andre?!

38:04.899 --> 38:06.300
Shit.

38:06.434 --> 38:09.571
Listen, think about
what we've been through.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.674
We have survived massacres
in Africa,

38:12.807 --> 38:15.643
enslavement, the Middle Passage.

38:15.777 --> 38:19.347
We survived reconstruction,
Jim Crow, lynchings

38:19.481 --> 38:23.317
and the ruthless oppression that
still continues till this day.

38:23.451 --> 38:26.153
But I don't know
if we can survive this.

38:26.287 --> 38:30.725
This systematic poisoning
of our people by the government.

38:33.728 --> 38:37.098
And by you... son.

38:39.501 --> 38:41.369
You are killing us all.

38:41.503 --> 38:43.371
Don't you see that?!
(grunts)

38:43.505 --> 38:46.441
Franklin! Stop it!

38:46.574 --> 38:48.175
-(Alton groaning)
-CISSY: You okay?

38:48.309 --> 38:51.012
-Are you okay?
-(groaning continues)

38:52.947 --> 38:55.049
(groaning)

38:55.182 --> 38:57.251
(panting)

38:59.987 --> 39:03.458
Don't ever call me "son" again.

39:03.591 --> 39:05.793
(panting)

39:05.927 --> 39:10.565
"For now... we see
through a glass, darkly."

39:10.698 --> 39:12.867
FRANKLIN:
Fucking poetry shit.
You should leave.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.636
"But then face to face."

39:14.802 --> 39:16.504
FRANKLIN:
Alton.

39:17.972 --> 39:21.308
Cissy. My love.

39:21.476 --> 39:23.745
FRANKLIN:
Leave, Alton.

39:23.878 --> 39:25.146
Face the truth.

39:25.312 --> 39:28.215
Alton, get the fuck out of here!

39:28.349 --> 39:29.551
Now!

39:29.684 --> 39:31.719
(Alton crying)

39:42.063 --> 39:44.966
(panting)

39:46.400 --> 39:48.135
(door opens)

39:53.908 --> 39:55.409
(Cissy sniffles)

39:55.543 --> 39:57.812
(crying quietly)

40:03.518 --> 40:05.553
* *

40:18.866 --> 40:20.101
-(muffled groan)
-None of this makes

40:20.234 --> 40:22.303
any fucking sense.
(sighs)

40:22.436 --> 40:24.405
How and why did you target me?

40:24.539 --> 40:26.107
(muffled groaning)

40:26.240 --> 40:28.042
Why didn't you just
take the money and run?

40:28.209 --> 40:31.579
-I don't understand.
-(muffled groaning)

40:31.713 --> 40:32.980
(yells, pants rapidly)

40:33.114 --> 40:35.049
Who the fuck are you?

40:36.050 --> 40:37.819
-I don't know anything.
-Tell me the fucking truth.

40:37.952 --> 40:39.621
-I don't know anything.
-I need the truth from you.

40:39.754 --> 40:40.955
-I don't understand.
-And I don't have a lot

40:41.088 --> 40:42.323
of time to sit here
and play this,

40:42.456 --> 40:44.926
whatever this fucking game is
with you. Huh?

40:45.059 --> 40:46.761
-I am a banker.
-Yeah? Yeah? You KGB?

40:46.894 --> 40:48.429
-I handle
international accounts.
-Are you KGB

40:48.563 --> 40:50.832
trying to smoke me out?

40:50.965 --> 40:53.067
Hmm? Answer me.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.569
You Hezbollah?

40:54.736 --> 40:57.438
Hmm? A double-cross, huh?

40:57.572 --> 40:59.406
Hezbollah?

40:59.574 --> 41:01.943
-I don't understand any of this.
-(groans)

41:02.076 --> 41:04.746
You ever hear of, uh...

41:04.879 --> 41:06.948
tormenta de toca?

41:07.081 --> 41:10.417
It's 14th century,
used in the Inquisition.

41:10.552 --> 41:13.154
Uh, then the, uh,
British used it

41:13.287 --> 41:16.090
on the Arabs
and the Jews in Palestine.

41:16.223 --> 41:18.092
(guitar concerto plays)

41:18.225 --> 41:19.527
(sighs)

41:19.661 --> 41:22.630
Tormenta de toca.

41:23.898 --> 41:26.100
Please, please, please.
No, no, no, no, no.

41:26.267 --> 41:29.804
No, no, I don't know nothing!
(yells, cries out)

41:31.673 --> 41:33.207
I don't know.

41:33.340 --> 41:36.110
-No, please. Please, no!
-The thing is,

41:36.277 --> 41:37.845
everybody talks
when they're drowning.

41:37.979 --> 41:39.446
I swear.

41:39.614 --> 41:43.217
No! No! No!
(muffled screams)

41:43.350 --> 41:45.987
(muffled sobbing)

41:46.120 --> 41:48.723
(coughing)

41:48.856 --> 41:51.893
* *

41:52.026 --> 41:53.995
Do you think I like doing this?

41:54.128 --> 41:55.997
You think I like hurting people?

41:56.130 --> 41:57.965
(Gabriel sobbing)

41:58.099 --> 41:59.701
I don't know anything.

41:59.834 --> 42:01.903
(coughs)
I swear.

42:02.036 --> 42:03.871
We'll see.

42:04.005 --> 42:05.573
GUSTAVO:
Got your message again.

42:05.707 --> 42:07.141
He's still not here.

42:07.274 --> 42:09.010
FRANKLIN:
Uh, he got his pager on him?

42:09.143 --> 42:11.045
Te dije he's busy.

42:11.178 --> 42:13.514
Too busy to see my fucking 911s?

42:13.648 --> 42:15.349
Maybe I can help you.

42:15.482 --> 42:18.720
No. No, not with this.
Gustavo, call him.

42:18.853 --> 42:21.155
And tell him this is extremely
important, all right?

42:21.288 --> 42:23.725
Okay. Está bien.

42:32.166 --> 42:34.168
(fax machine beeps, whirs)

42:48.015 --> 42:50.017
* *

43:04.365 --> 43:05.900
(sighs)

43:07.201 --> 43:08.502
GABRIEL:
I swear...

43:10.705 --> 43:12.740
I didn't.

43:15.576 --> 43:17.244
(inhales sharply)

43:18.612 --> 43:21.248
-(footsteps approaching)
-(keys jingling)

43:21.382 --> 43:23.484
-(knocking)
-MAN: !Policía!

43:23.617 --> 43:25.687
(Gabriel groaning softly)

43:28.089 --> 43:31.025
-(knocking)
-!Policía!

43:32.226 --> 43:34.628
-Abre la puerta.
-!Ahora!

43:36.363 --> 43:38.432
(window slides open)

43:38.565 --> 43:41.568
-(indistinct radio chatter)
-(Gabriel crying)

43:43.971 --> 43:45.606
(men speaking Spanish)

43:45.740 --> 43:47.608
-Gabriel.
-(Gabriel cries quietly)

43:47.742 --> 43:50.344
(men speaking Spanish)

43:50.477 --> 43:53.014
(Gabriel crying)

43:53.147 --> 43:55.149

44:02.589 --> 44:04.591
(indistinct radio chatter)

44:13.134 --> 44:14.535
(knocking)

44:14.668 --> 44:18.873
* If I didn't care *

44:19.006 --> 44:20.474
* More than words can say... *

44:20.607 --> 44:22.744
-Hi.
-Hey.

44:24.846 --> 44:27.514
-* If I didn't care *
-(sighs)

44:27.648 --> 44:29.951
You want to talk about it?

44:30.084 --> 44:32.653
* Would I feel this way? *

44:32.787 --> 44:36.557
-You burning something?
-Chicken skin.

44:36.690 --> 44:40.627
Oh. (grunts, sighs)

44:40.762 --> 44:45.699
* Then why do I thrill? *

44:45.833 --> 44:48.736
* And what makes my head
go round and round *

44:48.870 --> 44:51.873
You know,
I'm not that hungry, T.

44:52.006 --> 44:54.742
* While my heart stands still? *

44:54.876 --> 44:56.844
Good, 'cause I'm not cooking.

44:56.978 --> 44:59.546
* If I didn't care... *

44:59.680 --> 45:04.318
Aw, shit. (groaning)

45:04.451 --> 45:07.554
How did you know
I needed one of these?

45:07.688 --> 45:11.058
Nigga, everybody
can use one of these.

45:13.360 --> 45:15.997
(Franklin grunts, sighs)

45:18.065 --> 45:19.867
* And would I be sure that... *

45:20.001 --> 45:21.502
(tape recorder clicks)

45:21.635 --> 45:24.171
IRENE:
Let's just start
from the beginning.

45:24.305 --> 45:26.908
Name, why you're here.

45:27.041 --> 45:28.709
ALTON:
You gonna record everything?

45:28.843 --> 45:30.611
IRENE:
For both our sakes.

45:30.744 --> 45:32.746
Make sure
I don't get anything wrong.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.249
ALTON:
All this is wrong, but...

45:35.382 --> 45:37.852
I understand.

45:37.985 --> 45:41.355
(sighs)
My name is Alton Williams.

45:41.488 --> 45:44.425
I'm the father
of Franklin Saint,

45:44.558 --> 45:46.794
whose name you cannot use.

45:46.928 --> 45:48.930
(typewriter keys clacking)

45:49.063 --> 45:50.798
But he sells rock cocaine.

45:50.932 --> 45:54.601
Jesus. You okay?

45:56.370 --> 45:58.940
(Franklin cries quietly)

46:02.009 --> 46:03.878
(sighs)

46:04.045 --> 46:06.547
I think we in real trouble, T.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.782
-(typewriter keys clacking)
-ALTON: Thing is, the source

46:08.916 --> 46:13.020
of all that cocaine
is Reed Thompson of the CIA...

46:14.856 --> 46:16.991
...who's using the proceeds

46:17.124 --> 46:20.494
to fund an illegal war
in Nicaragua.

-* Would it be the same? *
-* Ooh, ooh, ooh *

46:36.944 --> 46:40.114
* Would my every prayer *

46:40.247 --> 46:46.820
* Begin and end
with just your name? *

46:46.954 --> 46:50.524

46:50.657 --> 46:56.330
* That this is love
beyond compare? *

46:58.132 --> 47:01.168
* Would all this be true *
