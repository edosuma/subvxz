any major injuries.

Heh-- Bet they're mad, though!

Mr. Krei, are you sure there's
nothing you wanna tell us?

-Good night!

05:02.460 --> 05:04.000

05:04.000 --> 05:08.790
Hiro, I am detecting
unusually thick mucus
in your nasal membranes.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.620
Well, that's disgusting.

05:10.620 --> 05:14.080
No viruses around the CEO.
That's the rule. Good night.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.170
Oh-kay, let's go, Baymax.

05:17.170 --> 05:19.380
I will monitor your symptoms.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.750
Why didn't you tell them?
I mean, they did save you.

05:21.750 --> 05:25.040
I do not need that kid
lecturing me about how
"that technology is too risky."

05:25.040 --> 05:28.830
-Is it risky?
-No risk, no reward.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.330
What'd I miss?

05:33.960 --> 05:35.330
Hiro, what did you just do?

05:35.330 --> 05:38.000
-Uh, changed my mind?
-You touched the apple.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.500
But I decided I wanted
the orange.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.620
There-- There's no comparison,
really, it's apples
and oranges, heh.

05:43.620 --> 05:46.750
Do you know how many microbes
you left on that apple?

05:46.750 --> 05:48.790
No, but I bet you do, Karmi.

05:48.790 --> 05:52.210
This is cold and flu season.
All it takes is one careless--

05:52.210 --> 05:55.040
-(sniff)
-(silverware falls)

05:56.670 --> 05:58.830
Come on, it was one sniff!

06:01.880 --> 06:04.920
Hi, Hiro.
Aw, do you feel okay?

06:04.920 --> 06:07.620
-Hm, you're a little warm.
-You look like death.
Go home.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.540
Why does everyone
think I'm sick?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.790
Me?
I never get sick.

06:11.790 --> 06:14.120
Every year, I get stung
by an irradiated bee.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.790
So I'm protected.

06:15.790 --> 06:17.120
An irradiated bee?

06:17.120 --> 06:20.750
Yeah.
I close my eyes, the doctor
says I'll feel a pinch,

06:20.750 --> 06:22.880
-and then--
-Fred, that's a flu shot.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.830
No!
Irradiated bee!

06:24.830 --> 06:27.120
That's what my mom says.

06:27.120 --> 06:32.620
-Uh, hey, Wasabi, new computer?
-Oh, it so much more than that.

about the sneezing.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.460

06:42.460 --> 06:44.120
Also, the screaming.

Um, let's see--

06:49.830 --> 06:51.920
At approximately,
t-- twenty-three hundred hours,

06:51.920 --> 06:54.830
You were defeated
by a child.

06:54.830 --> 06:57.000
-The kid had a robot.
-Yeah, tell him about the bot.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.580
Finish the job.
Understand?

06:59.580 --> 07:02.330
Finish... it!

07:02.330 --> 07:04.620

Good copy. Mad Jacks out.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.620

07:08.620 --> 07:10.710
What does it take, I wonder,

07:10.710 --> 07:12.960
to lay you low?

07:14.250 --> 07:16.880
(sneezes, groans)

07:18.790 --> 07:22.960
Rise and shine.
I made your favorite,
breakfast tofu-dilla.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.790
Okay, not anybody's favorite
yet, but... I need
an honest opinion.

07:25.790 --> 07:27.670

-Hiro?

07:27.670 --> 07:29.460
'Morning. (groans)

07:30.580 --> 07:32.290

Okay, Hiro,

07:36.580 --> 07:37.790
let's just check
that temperature.

07:37.790 --> 07:42.290
-Oh, you do have a moderate--
-Fever of one hundred and one.

07:42.290 --> 07:43.880
Right.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.710
Point two... nine.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.710
Let's take a peek
in your ears.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.540
Mm-hm.
Just what I suspected.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.710
Doctor/Baymax:
Fluid, in the auditory canal.

07:55.710 --> 07:58.040
Indicating a possible
viral infection.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.920
Ah-heh-- You know, typically
a patient seeks a second opinion

08:01.920 --> 08:04.920
after the diagnosis, not during.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.830
Sorry, Doctor.
He cares a lot.

08:07.830 --> 08:10.830
Let's see if he agrees
that you need to stay in bed
for a few days.

08:10.830 --> 08:12.210
But uh-- uh--
I don't want to.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.880
Bed rest is advised
for viral infections.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.290
Patience, Sheila.
It's the future.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.960
Go home, have some soup.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.750
Sleep, sleep, and more sleep.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.040
I guess you're too old
for a lolli...

08:27.330 --> 08:28.790
pop.

08:28.790 --> 08:32.080
Baymax:
Enjoyment of a lollipop
is not age conditional.

08:33.540 --> 08:35.380
Okay, Fred what did you
find out?

08:35.380 --> 08:37.380
The Mad Jacks
are an elite shadows ops.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.830
Hiro, I have brewed tea
for you.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.920
Uh, no thanks, Baymax.
I'm not thirsty.

08:41.920 --> 08:44.710
A patient diagnosed
with a viral infection

08:44.710 --> 08:46.880
should drink plenty
of liquids.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.290
Okay, I'll drink it later.

08:48.290 --> 08:50.040
Hey, where's Wasabi?

08:50.040 --> 08:54.250
One more pass
with the sanitizer, and--
Oh. Hey.

08:54.250 --> 08:55.380
Sorry I'm late.

08:55.380 --> 08:57.250
(Baymax fluffing pillow)

08:57.250 --> 09:01.920
Hiro, a patient diagnosed
with a viral infection
should rest.

It was a brand new computer!

10:33.620 --> 10:34.710
(crash)

10:34.710 --> 10:35.960
Wah-ha,
I see what you mean.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.330
(blowing nose)

10:39.330 --> 10:41.880
-(groans)
-Dispatcher:
All units, disturbance reported

10:41.880 --> 10:43.000
at Krei Tech Industries.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.120
Something's up.
I knew it.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.170
Ohh.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.250
Reports of an aerial attack.

10:47.250 --> 10:48.380
The Mad Jacks.

10:48.380 --> 10:49.920
(beeping)

11:05.040 --> 11:06.120
Aah!

11:06.120 --> 11:07.750
Shouldn't you be home
in bed, short stack?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.040
You don't even know.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.750
Greg Jack:
Jack, talk to me.
You got a 20 on the bot?

11:10.750 --> 11:14.330
-Negative, Jack.
-Yeah, well... y-- you're in
for a surprise.

11:14.330 --> 11:16.080
Kid's bluffing.
Bot's not here.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.500
Maybe, uh, that
was the surprise.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.460
Taking Mad Jacks on alone?
That is surprising.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.040
And idiotic.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.540
-Aah!
-(crash)

11:26.540 --> 11:27.830
Ah!

11:31.170 --> 11:32.620
(groans)

11:36.670 --> 11:38.500
I will scan you now.

11:40.210 --> 11:43.120
Looks like you got yourself
a hairline fracture
of the tibia, Hiro.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.080
-Great.
-A fracture?
You mean like, broken?

11:46.080 --> 11:48.620
Hiro, how can you
break your leg when
you've been sick in bed?

11:48.620 --> 11:53.750
Well, um, it was a--
it w-- heh-- it was a
video game accident?

11:53.750 --> 11:56.250
-Is that a thing?
-We don't get a lot of it.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.830
In fact, this is the first.

11:57.830 --> 12:02.710
Baymax:
Doctor, there is also a second,
smaller fracture in the fibula.

12:02.710 --> 12:05.290
My scan is more detailed.
I will share it.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.170
I said "family only."

12:07.170 --> 12:09.170
He wants me to be satisfied
with my care.

12:09.170 --> 12:11.540
(phone vibrates)

12:11.540 --> 12:13.000
It's from Baymax.

12:14.210 --> 12:18.790
Yes, well, it appears
the leg is fractured
in two places.

12:18.790 --> 12:21.040
What game was it?
I don't think you should
play that one anymore.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.460
(sighs)

12:24.500 --> 12:26.960
There.
A smile helps you heal.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.170
Now get well fast, Hiro.

12:28.170 --> 12:30.080
Yeah.
And quit doing dumb stuff.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.750
Seriously.
Can't be too careful.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.460
It's outrageous.
To sneak outside
in your condition,

12:34.460 --> 12:38.290
to chase down
flying daredevils,
and not call me?

12:38.290 --> 12:40.080
Ahh!
There are no words!

12:40.080 --> 12:42.080
Hey, I knew Krei
was in danger.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.170
-And you had
to prove yourself right.
-I was right.

12:45.170 --> 12:46.330
And now--
Aah-- Haa-- Haa-- Haa--

12:46.330 --> 12:49.250
Your leg
should remain elevated.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.880
Also, you still require fluids
and rest.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.920
People, the health care
companion has spoken.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.170
Visiting hours are over.

12:56.170 --> 12:58.830
Right.
Rest up and wise up.

12:58.830 --> 13:02.620
And no secret missions.
But if there are, you got
my digits, right?

13:02.620 --> 13:05.330
Krei's the one in danger,
not me.

13:05.330 --> 13:08.880
This situation
requires persistence.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.330
I know.
That's why I can't
just give up.

13:11.330 --> 13:15.170
Persistence is part
of my health care matrix.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.750
(grunting)

13:18.750 --> 13:22.080
Ahh, heh-heh.
Great work, Jacks!

13:22.080 --> 13:23.210
Rendezvous status?

13:23.210 --> 13:25.080
Unknown.
Client's gone radio silent.

13:25.080 --> 13:26.250
Jaq:
Dude's creepy.

13:26.250 --> 13:28.080
Hm.
Roger that.

13:33.250 --> 13:34.080
Ha!

13:36.460 --> 13:37.580
Aah!

13:39.080 --> 13:41.330
-Okay, suit.
-It's actually
more a blazer.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.420
Look.
Our employer just wants
the chip.

13:43.420 --> 13:44.670
And he's kind of a freak.

13:44.670 --> 13:47.500
So, I'd hand it over,
if I were you.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.290
Ah-ha-ha-ha...
love to know who
that employer is.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.830
Not a chance.

13:52.830 --> 13:54.790
(grunt)
Mad Jacks are discreet.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.710
-Hooah! Hooah! Hooah!
-Hah! Hah! Heh!

13:56.710 --> 13:57.920
-Hooah!
-Uh-yah!

13:57.920 --> 13:59.080
-Hah!
-Haah!

13:59.080 --> 14:01.170
(both grunting)

14:02.170 --> 14:04.620
(phone buzzes and vibrates)

14:07.170 --> 14:08.670
Hiro:
Hello?

14:08.670 --> 14:12.250
Haha, hello, funny thing.
I really could use Big Hero 6.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.540
Mr. Krei?

14:13.540 --> 14:15.420
Yes!
I've got a problem.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.540
First of all,
they ruined my blazer.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.880
♪ Big Hero 6
Fighting for the right ♪

14:20.880 --> 14:24.330
♪ Searching through the night
Mad Jacks are the mercs ♪

14:24.330 --> 14:25.250

14:25.250 --> 14:27.960

And could be anywhere.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.380
Fred:
I'll incorporate that
into my song,

14:29.380 --> 14:30.500
but you know, make it rhyme.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.210
We just have to cover
as much ground as we can,

14:32.210 --> 14:33.120
as fast as we can.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.120
On my signal, we go silent!

14:45.210 --> 14:46.880
Honey Lemon:
They should be easy to spot.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.290
Yeah, flying jet pack people
should stand out.

14:49.290 --> 14:52.380
-Masquerade ball?
-Sure. Let's go with that.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.040
Picking up anything, Baymax?

14:54.040 --> 14:57.580
No.
I have not detected
the jet turbines.

14:57.580 --> 15:01.250
How can you guys
possibly search
the entire city? (coughs)

15:01.250 --> 15:03.000
I should be out there
helping you.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.960
That would be counterproductive
to your recovery.

15:05.960 --> 15:10.000
I know, I know.
In bed, leg elevated.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.250
Right after I do this.

15:36.920 --> 15:41.170
I'm comin' up empty.
Dang it, I just know
the Jacks are makin' their move.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.330
(crash)

16:33.170 --> 16:34.460
-Good evening.
-Ah!

16:36.670 --> 16:40.750
Do you come
bearing Alistair Krei's
black market chip?

16:40.750 --> 16:42.460
You hired the Mad Jacks!

16:42.460 --> 16:45.170
The Mad Jacks
guarantee success!

16:45.170 --> 16:46.960
Success and havoc.
Ha-ha-ha.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.460
And it's always awesome!

16:54.170 --> 16:56.170
Ooh...

16:56.170 --> 16:59.290
Big Hero 6, on the move.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.040
All right, focus up.
This is how I see it.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.750
We keep the enemy occupied.
you escape with the package.
Mission accomplished.

17:04.750 --> 17:06.460
Super.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.500
-Although...
-'Ey. My plan is diamond.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.620
Flawless.

17:10.620 --> 17:16.080
The security of the package...
is paramount.

17:16.080 --> 17:17.460
All right, all right,
I-- I-- I hear you,

17:17.460 --> 17:20.000
lemme just, uh--
Okay, minor adjustment.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.540
I will keep the package secure
until the enemy is neutralized.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.000
Boo-yah!

17:25.000 --> 17:27.580
Hey, you... good catch.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.380
Mad Jacks!
Let's fly.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.500
Listen up, Jacks,
keep your eyes peeled
for hostiles.

17:36.500 --> 17:37.670
Jaq:
How many, Jack?

17:37.670 --> 17:39.120
Well, with a handle
like Big Hero 6,

17:39.120 --> 17:41.500
I figure we're lookin' at
somewhere between
five and seven.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.620
Roger that.
Perimeter sweep in progress.
I will-- Ooh!

17:44.620 --> 17:46.880
Give Fredzilla
a piggy back ride?
I'm in!

17:53.540 --> 17:55.460
(grunts)

17:55.460 --> 17:56.620
(thud)

18:00.080 --> 18:01.080
Huh!

18:04.920 --> 18:06.620
(blasts)

18:09.710 --> 18:11.380
Oww!

18:11.380 --> 18:12.420
Ahh!

18:12.420 --> 18:13.460
(thud)

18:13.460 --> 18:14.620
Not cool!

18:14.620 --> 18:17.380
Fred:
Hey-- Hey-- Don't make me
hurl in here!

18:17.380 --> 18:18.500
Ahh-wahh-whoa!

18:20.540 --> 18:21.580
-(crash)
-(groans)

18:21.580 --> 18:23.790
Don't worry, Freddie.
We're here to help.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.620
Must be some kinda party, huh?

18:25.620 --> 18:26.960
It usually is.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.170
Keep the change.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.380
It would be preferable
to resolve this conflict

18:32.380 --> 18:34.250
-without violence.
-(explosion)

18:34.250 --> 18:36.580
Greg Jack:
No way! The violence rocks.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.290
It's a major part
of the Mad Jack program.

18:39.290 --> 18:40.500
Oh, have a taste!

18:40.500 --> 18:42.540
-(blasts)
-(crash)

18:43.620 --> 18:46.000
And the bot is down
for the count!

18:46.000 --> 18:49.250
Not a chance!
That bot's been
taking care of me.

18:49.250 --> 18:50.620
Time for me to return the favor.

18:50.620 --> 18:51.670
Hiro?

18:51.670 --> 18:53.830
Yah!
Have you lost it?

18:53.830 --> 18:55.420
That is not Hiro.

18:55.420 --> 18:58.170
Uh, I am being
the perfect patient.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.710
Leg elevated, plenty of liquids.

19:01.830 --> 19:03.580
And of course, rest.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.620
(blasts)

19:07.620 --> 19:09.620
(beeps)

19:16.460 --> 19:17.580
(electricity blasting)

19:17.580 --> 19:19.830
Taser. Uh.
Good call.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.460
Ohh!

19:23.460 --> 19:25.210
-Thanks, Baymax.
-You are welcome.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.460
Time to try out the boosters
on this thing.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.670
Oh, yeah!

19:32.670 --> 19:36.670
Eat my dust!
(chuckles) Whoa!

19:36.670 --> 19:37.540
The bot!

19:39.170 --> 19:40.670
(grunting)

19:40.670 --> 19:44.460
Oh Jack down!

19:44.460 --> 19:47.170
Perhaps you should consider
less dangerous activities.

19:47.170 --> 19:50.330
Maybe you should...
think about... whatever.

19:50.330 --> 19:51.670
Krei's chip, please.

19:53.170 --> 19:55.880
-Greg Jack: Ugh!
-Thanks, Greg.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.710
Wow.
That's cold.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.420
Jack extraction! ASAP!

20:00.420 --> 20:02.540
♪ Three times the Jack
to watch your back ♪

20:02.540 --> 20:05.880
♪ Mad Mad Mad Mad
Mad Mad Mad Mad Jacks ♪

20:07.540 --> 20:09.120
Can you guys
get this back to Krei?

20:09.120 --> 20:12.080
No problem.
And get some rest, robo-genius.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.000
Feeling better already.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.710
And by now,
the chip should be back
in Alistair's hands.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.580
The moment of truth.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.120
The moment when
you turn it over
to the security team.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.620
Instead of doing
something stupid.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.620
Is there something
wrong, Alistair?

20:28.620 --> 20:31.750
The reckless tycoon
showing caution?

20:31.750 --> 20:33.670
Restraint?

20:33.670 --> 20:35.080
I need the tech security team.

20:36.290 --> 20:38.750
But Alistair, remember
the abduction.

20:38.750 --> 20:40.040
Who can you trust?

20:40.040 --> 20:41.620
Who's on your side?

20:41.620 --> 20:43.040
Who knows?

20:44.210 --> 20:47.750
Actually, never mind.

20:47.750 --> 20:51.580
The person who
was after this,
whoever hired the Mad Jacks...

20:51.580 --> 20:52.670
What about them?

20:52.670 --> 20:54.880
What if they've infiltrated
my security team?

20:54.880 --> 20:56.500
Like what, a spy?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.460
You're not usually
this paranoid.

20:58.460 --> 21:01.120
Hey, I was abducted.
It does things to you.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.120
(beep)

21:04.920 --> 21:06.830
I'm not taking any chances.

21:06.830 --> 21:10.210
There we are, Alistair.
That's the stuff.

21:10.210 --> 21:12.620
We will be the only ones
who see what's on this.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.380
Nothing?

21:16.380 --> 21:19.170
No. The money.
Th-- The abduction.

21:19.170 --> 21:21.830
Everything that happened!
It was all for nothing?

21:21.830 --> 21:26.290
It probably is better
that we were the only ones
who saw this.

21:26.290 --> 21:31.580
So many files...
so many secrets!

21:32.620 --> 21:35.670
Obake:
Ah, Hiro Hamada.

21:38.790 --> 21:42.420
