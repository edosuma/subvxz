00:38.440 --> 00:43.560
.. so there we were at 2.30am. I was wishing
I'd never come to cadet training school.

00:43.760 --> 00:47.355
To the south lay water. We couldn't cross that.

00:47.520 --> 00:50.876
East and west,
two armies squeezed us in a pincer.

00:51.040 --> 00:56.478
The only way was north. I had to go for it
and pray the gods were smiling on me.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.712
I picked up the dice and threw two sixes.

00:59.880 --> 01:03.270
Caldicott couldn't believe it.
My go again. Another two sixes!

01:03.480 --> 01:09.316
Rimmer, don't you realise that no one
is slightly interested in anything you say?

01:09.480 --> 01:11.471
You've got this psychological defect

01:11.640 --> 01:15.428
which blinds you to the fact
that you're boring people to death.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.716
How come you can't sense that?

01:17.880 --> 01:20.269
Anyway, I picked up the dice again...

01:20.440 --> 01:22.749
Unbelievable! Another two sixes!

01:22.960 --> 01:26.270
Rimmer! No one wants to know some stupid story

01:26.440 --> 01:29.955
about how you beat
your cadet school training officer at "Risk".

01:30.880 --> 01:34.919
Then disaster! I threw a two and a three.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.197
Caldicott threw snake eyes. I was still in it!

01:38.400 --> 01:42.154
- Cat, can you talk to him?
- What?

01:43.360 --> 01:48.480
Anyway, to cut a long story short,
I threw a five and a four, another double six,

01:48.640 --> 01:53.395
followed by a double five, then a six and a three.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.869
This guy could bore for his country.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.838
How can you remember what dice you threw
in a game you played when you were 17?

02:02.040 --> 02:04.918
I jotted it down in my "Risk" campaign book.

02:05.080 --> 02:08.959
I always did that
so I could replay my moments of glory

02:09.120 --> 02:11.918
over a glass of brandy in the sleeping quarters.

02:12.080 --> 02:16.437
- What better way to spend a Saturday night?
- You got me.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.110
So, he came back with a three and a two...

02:20.320 --> 02:23.949
Rimmer, can't you tell
the story is not gripping me?

02:24.120 --> 02:29.513
I'm in a state of non-grippedness.
I am completely smegging ungripped.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.750
Shut the smeg up!

02:31.920 --> 02:34.354
Don't you want to hear the "Risk" story?

02:34.520 --> 02:36.954
That's what I've been saying for 15 minutes.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.554
I haven't got to the really interesting bit.

02:39.720 --> 02:43.838
- What really interesting bit?
- Ah, well, that was about two hours later,

02:44.040 --> 02:46.315
after I'd thrown a four and a one.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.550
- I picked up the dice...
- Hang on.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.510
- This is the same as the dull bit.
- You don't know what I did with the dice.

02:53.680 --> 02:59.073
I could have jammed them up his nostrils
and they could have blasted out of his ears.

02:59.240 --> 03:04.268
- That would've been interesting.
- OK. What did you do with the dice?

03:04.440 --> 03:06.795
I threw a five and a two.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.710
- And that's the really interesting bit?
- Well, it got me into Irkutsk.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.871
Hmm... Curious.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.319
Extraordinary!

03:17.480 --> 03:20.278
What a truly copasetic piece of machinery.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.078
- What is it?
- It appears to be a device

03:24.240 --> 03:26.754
that converts an individual into digital information

03:26.920 --> 03:30.799
and then transmits him as light beams
to another point in space.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.191
Essentially, it's a matter... transporter.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.995
It's pretty neat... huh?

03:40.880 --> 03:43.269
- Where'd you get it?
- It must be a prototype.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.159
I found it in the research labs on Z Deck.

03:46.320 --> 03:50.279
I cobbled together the missing circuitry
and it appears to be fully functional.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.318
Theoretically,
it can transport several people at once.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.313
Would you like to grip a paddle, sir?

03:58.240 --> 04:01.198
We'll meet you by the navicomp in Starbug.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.236
Let's go.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.553
I'm sorry about that, sir.
I neglected to engage the depth function.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.279
We'll walk, Kryten. We'll walk.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.755
So, besides cutting down on shoe leather,
what good is it?

04:22.960 --> 04:25.633
Exploration. It can take you anywhere.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.118
It homes in on atmosphere-bearing planets
within a range of 500,000 light years.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.829
If there are life forms nearby,
this'll take you straight to 'em.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.429
Are there planets with an atmosphere in range?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.631
Several, according to the paddle's scanners,

04:38.800 --> 04:42.588
but the most interesting prospect
appears to be 200,000 light years away.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.275
It would take Starbug
several billion years to reach it.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.910
It wouldn't be so bad.
Rimmer could finish his "Risk" story.

04:51.800 --> 04:55.759
Travelling sub-space via the paddle,
we would reach it almost instantaneously.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.269
- What are we waiting for?
- Hey, hey!

04:58.440 --> 05:01.591
- Nobody's rearranging MY molecules.
- It's perfectly safe, sir,

05:01.760 --> 05:05.389
but I suggest that Mr Rimmer and I
form a scout party.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.318
What?!

05:07.480 --> 05:10.233
If the atmosphere isn't breathable,
we won't be affected.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.755
If it is, we send the paddle to pick you up.

05:12.960 --> 05:16.316
The thing is, I'd love to be in the scout party,

05:16.480 --> 05:19.552
facing all those thrilling
unknown dangers with you,

05:19.720 --> 05:24.271
fighting a frontiersman's path of discovery,
but you're forgetting one thing.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.790
No, sir. I've taken your congenital cowardice
into consideration.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.197
I'm a hologram. I can't touch the thing.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.119
Well, you do have a small physical presence.

05:34.320 --> 05:35.958
Precisely.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.838
- Holly, give me Mr Rimmer's light-bee.
- Wait a minute...

05:46.000 --> 05:48.468
- Where am I?
- This is Rimmer?

05:48.640 --> 05:52.679
Yeah, it buzzes around inside him
and projects his image.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.670
My God! That was disgusting!

05:57.880 --> 06:00.474
Please, sir, that's
a sophisticated piece of hardware.

06:00.680 --> 06:04.116
- Really? Anyone fancy a game of squash?
- Sir!

06:04.320 --> 06:08.791
Thank you. Now, if all goes well,
the paddle will rematerialise here.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.074
Press this key and you'll be transported
to the planet, a safe distance from us.

06:21.360 --> 06:24.875
- What is this place?
- I can't pinpoint our location precisely,

06:25.040 --> 06:27.793
but the atmosphere is indeed breathable.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.951
I'll return the paddle.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.838
- What now?
- I suggest we run, sir.

06:34.040 --> 06:37.953
I suggest we ambulate
as fast as the local gravity will allow.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.112
- Why?
- Because of them, sir.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.672
Sir?

06:49.560 --> 06:51.835
Must be safe. Let's go.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.038
This will be ze final push, mein Kamerads,

06:59.200 --> 07:03.239
Their resources are poor. Their vill is veek!

07:03.400 --> 07:06.710
We can crush zem.
We can grind zem into ze dirt!

07:06.880 --> 07:11.874
We can chew up their bodies
and spit zem out as if zey are sauerkraut!

07:12.440 --> 07:15.398
Intruders! Seize zem!

07:16.160 --> 07:17.559
So long...

07:18.040 --> 07:19.473
.. suckers!

07:20.360 --> 07:22.351
Dummkopfs! Arrest zem!

07:22.560 --> 07:25.916
- Get us out of here!
- Don't panic me! I'm doing my best!

07:27.640 --> 07:29.631
- Where are we?
- Don't know.

07:29.800 --> 07:34.271
Stone. We're in some sort of
narrow stone passageway.

07:34.440 --> 07:38.194
- So what do we do?
- I can see daylight.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.269
We'll just stay here
till we work out where we are.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.956
At least we're out of trouble.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.111
Who were those guys?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.999
The short one with the stupid tash was Hitler.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.875
The jerky one
with the child molester glasses was Goebbels.

07:58.080 --> 08:01.231
The fat bastard must have been Goering.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.392
He was a cocaine addict and a transvestite.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.872
If things had worked out different,
he had the makings of a movie star.

08:09.040 --> 08:11.270
Hands up, pig dogs!

08:11.440 --> 08:14.637
- I've just worked out were we are.
- Get ze machine!

08:19.280 --> 08:21.589
You seriously telling me he's a transvestite?

08:21.760 --> 08:24.399
- Yeah.
- With those hips?!

08:31.160 --> 08:35.676
- I think we've lost them.
- I can't believe how feeble they were.

08:35.840 --> 08:39.991
I've seen more convincing dinosaurs
inside a packet of Wheaty Flakes.

08:40.159 --> 08:42.434
There's something wrong here.

08:42.640 --> 08:46.076
Reach for the sky, boys!
Thank you very much. Thank you.

08:46.240 --> 08:51.553
Lets take it-a nice and easy or I splash-a
your guts around like communion wine.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.599
- OK, get moving. Thank you very much.
- Which way?

08:56.920 --> 08:58.399
Thataway.

08:59.400 --> 09:03.393
- What do you think they'll do?
- Whatever it takes to understand the paddle.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.910
Hey, if you mean torture,
then say the word "torture".

09:07.080 --> 09:09.594
- I can take it.
- OK. They may torture us.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.951
- Torture us!
- They probably won't, man.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.989
They're probably not interested in the paddle.
They'll probably just execute us.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.351
You're just saying that to make me feel better.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.348
Those guys are fiends.
They instantly know your weak spots.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.269
They only have to force me
into platform shoes and flared trousers,

09:29.440 --> 09:31.590
and I'll sing like Tweety Pie.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.314
Dunno what the smeg went wrong.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.119
Kryten never mentioned travelling back in time.

09:37.280 --> 09:40.750
It was just supposed
to find a breathable atmosphere.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.639
How did we wind up in the Third Reich?

09:43.840 --> 09:46.559
What are those guys doing out there?

09:46.720 --> 09:48.711
- Building something.
- What?

09:48.920 --> 09:52.629
Oh, nothing. Nothing.
Just a sculpture, you know. A modern art job.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.475
- The kind you get in shopping malls.
- What's it made of?

09:56.640 --> 10:01.191
Wood. It's a sort of inverted L shape in wood.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.518
Does it have a kind of rope motif?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.833
There's a sort of noosey theme to it, yeah.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.348
It's gallows, right?
Look, if it's gallows, say it's gallows.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.193
- I can take it.
- OK, it's gallows.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.391
They're gonna hang us!

10:18.560 --> 10:21.711
Look, man, don't panic. We're gonna escape.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.871
- How?
- Just...

10:24.040 --> 10:26.998
Hijack the guards,
nick their uniforms and stroll out.

10:28.120 --> 10:32.272
Are you insane? You seriously expect me
to wear grey out of season?

10:34.440 --> 10:38.035
- I'd rather hang.
- Hang on! Hang on! Something's happening.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.754
Some kind of parade or drill, but...

10:41.960 --> 10:44.633
- But what?
- Hang on.

10:44.800 --> 10:49.715
These guys aren't Nazis.
They're all wearing different period costumes.

10:49.880 --> 10:54.192
There's one looks like Al Capone.
There's another like Mussolini.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.510
Richard III, Napoleon...

10:56.680 --> 11:01.754
Smeg! It's like all the worst people in history
brought together in one place.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.309
Oh, my God! There's James Last!

11:05.920 --> 11:08.559
I recognise him from Rimmer's record collection.

11:08.760 --> 11:14.915
- What are they doing?
- Just lining up... some kind of firing squad.

11:15.120 --> 11:18.317
Whoa! Hang on! Someone's being brought out.

11:18.480 --> 11:20.516
They're tying him to a stake.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.316
It's Winnie the Pooh.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.157
- What?
- Winnie the Pooh, I swear!

11:30.040 --> 11:32.429
He's refusing the blindfold.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.189
They're tying Winnie the Pooh to the stake?

11:43.720 --> 11:47.076
That's something no one should ever have to see!

11:49.640 --> 11:55.829
My God, sirs! You may break our bones,
but you will never break our spirits!

11:57.160 --> 12:03.474
Good day, good sirs.
The name's Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.915
We have to face facts - the war is lost.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.355
What are we gonna do?

12:14.520 --> 12:19.753
I don't know. I still feel there's a solution
probably involving triangles.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.077
Pythagoras, what is it with you?
Always the triangles.

12:23.280 --> 12:28.400
Your solution to everything is triangles!
Some problems can't be solved by triangles.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.154
Hey, we got us some prisoners.

12:31.320 --> 12:35.438
Anybody got a burger? I haven't eaten
in five minutes. Thank you very much.

12:35.640 --> 12:40.236
- Could someone tell me what's going on?
- These people aren't waxdroids.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.431
- Waxdroids?
- Of course!

12:42.600 --> 12:46.673
This whole place, the entire complex,
is a colossal waxdroid theme park.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.474
See? "Prehistoric World" - where we materialised.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.234
On either side, "Villain World" and "Hero World".

12:52.440 --> 12:57.070
I thought waxdroids were programmed
to repeat a sequence of routines over and over?

12:57.280 --> 13:00.590
They must have broken their programming.
Now they're running amok.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.759
We've been left here all alone
for millions of years...

13:04.960 --> 13:07.076
We learned to break our programs.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.471
And we've been fighting this idiotic war
ever since.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.313
- A war?
- Good versus evil, sugar.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.275
- Where's the rest of your army?
- They've all been killed...

13:18.480 --> 13:22.393
All our best warriors are gone, man -
John Wayne, Joan of Arc,

13:22.560 --> 13:25.950
Nelson, Wellington... Hell, baby, even Doris Day.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.793
They've all died in battle, man.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.312
And you're all that's left, a smattering
of intellectuals, pacifists and celebrities?

13:33.520 --> 13:35.511
We number less than 20.

13:35.720 --> 13:40.191
If only we numbered 21,
then we could form an equilateral triangle.

13:40.360 --> 13:45.115
Will you shut up already with the triangles?!
You're driving me crazy!

13:45.320 --> 13:47.515
Er, who do the enemy have?

13:47.680 --> 13:50.558
The cream of evil - Hitler, Napoleon, Messalina,

13:50.720 --> 13:53.234
Caligula, the Boston Strangler, dozens of them.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.036
And we don't even have a leader.
We haven't really got a chance!

13:58.240 --> 14:02.153
My God, Kryten! This is my destiny!

14:02.320 --> 14:05.995
- I was born for this moment!
- I'm not following you, sir.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.716
Across that valley lies an army of darkness
such as mankind has never seen.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.510
The only thing between them and total victory
is this pathetic pocket of resistance,

14:15.680 --> 14:17.796
without a leader, without a plan.

14:17.960 --> 14:21.839
Into this bleak arena steps a man -
the man for the moment.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.396
- Oh. Who?
- Me! Who do you think? Pat Boone?

14:26.600 --> 14:31.879
Gentlemen, ladies, assemble your troops
for inspection at 1500 hours.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.116
Together with my valiant adjutant, Kryten,

14:34.280 --> 14:39.718
I'm gonna turn you into the meanest fighting
machine that ever graced a battlefield.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.797
Come on, Kryten.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.958
I don't want to fight! I might get killed!

14:48.240 --> 14:51.755
.. and we've been fighting
the Wax War ever since.

14:51.960 --> 14:56.431
- What's the point of this war?
- They want to melt us down,

14:56.600 --> 14:59.672
insert new programs
and turn us into their own kind.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.195
That's why we're becoming
so hopelessly outnumbered.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.518
- On your feet, pigs!
- Hey, buddy, we just...

15:06.720 --> 15:09.029
Silence, scum!

15:09.240 --> 15:13.518
Do you not bow in the presence
of the Emperor Caligula?

15:13.720 --> 15:17.190
- Who is this guy?
- He was a famous Roman emperor.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.432
He slept with his mother and sisters
and ate his son.

15:20.600 --> 15:26.311
A little advice - we all feel peckish
after making love, but most of us settle for pizza.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.596
You are an impudent fool!

15:30.840 --> 15:33.593
- Don't know who the other one is.
- That's Rasputin,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.439
the most despised man of his era.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.870
This machine, how does it work?

15:39.080 --> 15:43.596
- I don't know. If I did, I wouldn't be here.
- Very well.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.592
Rasputin, bring in the bucket of soapy frogs
and remove his trousers!

15:48.800 --> 15:51.473
It's to do with travelling across sub-space.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.036
- Demonstrate.
- Well, like I said, I don't really know.

15:55.240 --> 16:00.189
Very well. Rasputin, bring hither
the skin-diving suit with the bottom cut out

16:00.360 --> 16:03.318
and unleash the rampant wildebeest.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.069
Hang on! I'll try my best. Just give it here.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.795
- Ah! You think I'm insane?
- Shall we take a vote?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.711
Silence, scum!

16:13.880 --> 16:16.235
Shut up!

16:17.800 --> 16:20.030
We'll all hold on to it.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.359
Now!

16:26.560 --> 16:28.790
Come on! Let's get out of here.

16:35.680 --> 16:39.116
Rasputin, I'm very cross indeed! Guards!

16:41.600 --> 16:46.799
This way! If we make good time,
we'll be back at HQ by sunset.

16:47.560 --> 16:52.554
What a challenge!
The greatest minds in military history against me!

16:52.720 --> 16:56.713
- Let's pray they're up to it.
- Is your sanity chip working, sir?

16:56.880 --> 17:00.156
Have you any conception
of what's lining up for inspection?

17:00.320 --> 17:05.030
I'll soon shake them up.
By God, I wish the lo Amateur Wargamers

17:05.200 --> 17:08.795
and Battle of Neasden Recreators Society
could see me now.

17:08.960 --> 17:13.078
- They'd choke on their pikestaffs.
- Thank you very much, sir. Thank you.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.319
- As you were, Sergeant Presley.
- Guys are awaiting inspection. Thank you.

17:18.640 --> 17:21.790
- Well done, Presley.
- Uh-huh-huh.

17:22.800 --> 17:25.712
- After you, sir.
- Kryten, let's see what we've got.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.749
- What's your name, soldier?
- His name's Gandhi, sir. Mahatma Ghandi.

17:43.960 --> 17:49.273
Well, get him out of that damn nappy
and into a uniform. Have you no pride, man?

17:49.440 --> 17:54.434
Don't you want to win this war?
Don't eyeball me, Ghandi.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.398
Get on the floor and give me 50. Now!

18:01.560 --> 18:04.632
Teresa, sir. Mother Teresa.

18:05.800 --> 18:08.155
Assisi, sir. St Francis of Assisi.

18:08.320 --> 18:12.552
There's only two kinds from Assisi -
steers and queers. Which are you, boy?

18:12.760 --> 18:14.876
Moving hastily on, sir.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.430
- What's he doing here?
- He was posted from the fiction section.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.318
The Dalai Lama.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.431
Mr Noel Coward, sir.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.512
- Delighted to meet you, dear boy.
- Shut up.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.757
- Monsieur Jean-Paul Sartre, sir.
- Who?

18:30.920 --> 18:33.229
He's a philosopher, sir, an existentialist.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.716
Well, Sartre,
we don't like existentialists around here,

18:36.920 --> 18:41.038
and we certainly don't like French philosophers
poncing around in polo necks,

18:41.200 --> 18:47.150
filling everyone's heads with their theories
about the bleakness of existence. Clear?

18:48.240 --> 18:53.553
Well, you're quite the worst bunch
of famous historical waxdroids

18:53.720 --> 18:57.269
I've ever had the misfortune
to clap my eyes on!

18:57.440 --> 19:01.797
You're a total bloody shambles,
and if we're gonna win this war,

19:01.960 --> 19:05.430
someone is gonna have to
turn you into soldiers!

19:05.600 --> 19:09.354
And that someone,
ladies and gentlemen, is me!

19:10.640 --> 19:12.915
Over to you, Kryten.

19:16.360 --> 19:18.669
I'm watching you, Gandhi.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.869
# We are tough and we are mean

19:23.040 --> 19:25.395
# Arnie Rimmer's death machine

19:25.560 --> 19:27.835
# All we do is kill and slay

19:28.000 --> 19:30.434
# Don't care if we get blown away

19:30.640 --> 19:32.790
# A-R-N-I-E

19:33.000 --> 19:35.594
# A-R-N-I-E

19:35.760 --> 19:39.116
# Arnie Rimmer's Death machiiiiiine!

19:39.280 --> 19:42.716
# Hey! Hey! #

19:45.320 --> 19:47.470
You're driving them too hard, sir.

19:47.680 --> 19:51.673
- It's my job to drive them hard.
- Three of them have melted.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.196
Perhaps I've been too tough,
but it's for their own good.

19:55.400 --> 20:00.554
- You're killing them for their own good?
- Look, the enemy will try and kill them.

20:00.760 --> 20:04.070
They won't need to.
You'll have wiped them out first.

20:04.240 --> 20:10.429
I know what I'm doing, Kryten.
We attack tomorrow under cover of daylight.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.199
- Daylight, sir?
- It's the last thing they'll expect,

20:15.360 --> 20:17.351
a daylight charge over the minefield.

20:17.560 --> 20:22.953
- The what-field?!
- I'll coordinate things from here. Now...

20:23.160 --> 20:26.675
- Rimmer!
- Thank you, sir. People say they know you.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.229
Listy! Welcome to Command Centre.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.750
Rimmer, what's going on out there?
Isn't that Mahatma Gandhi?

20:32.920 --> 20:36.276
What's he doing practising hand-to-hand combat
with a nun?

20:36.440 --> 20:38.431
That's not a nun, Listy.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.752
That's Lieutenant Colonel Mother Teresa.
She's a soldier now.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.396
- What are you doing, buddy?
- I'm winning this war, "buddy".

20:46.560 --> 20:50.838
You won't believe what a ragamuffin bunch
of lefty, wishy-washy liberals they were

20:51.000 --> 20:54.549
before I knocked some good old-fashioned
death-or-glory bloodlust into them.

20:54.760 --> 20:59.072
You've turned a group of holy men
and pacifists into the Dirty Dozen!

20:59.840 --> 21:03.879
I can't take all the credit.
I couldn't have done it without Kryten.

21:04.080 --> 21:08.710
I'm sorry, sirs. I'm programmed to obey,
no matter how deranged the human order.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.549
Rimmer, you're gonna get these guys wiped out.
They're not soldiers!

21:12.720 --> 21:15.154
- He's flipped.
- With respect, sir, he's right.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.596
- I beg you to reconsider.
- They're only waxdroids.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.713
Rimmer, they've broken their programming.
They're capable of independent thought.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.873
That makes them alive, practically people.
I'm not gonna let you do it.

21:27.440 --> 21:29.431
- Pardon me?
- You heard me!

21:29.600 --> 21:33.798
- You talked 'em into it. I'll talk 'em out.
- I see. Sergeant Presley?

21:34.000 --> 21:38.391
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Place these gentlemen under arrest.

21:38.560 --> 21:42.519
- If they resist, shoot them.
- OK, boys. Let me see them understains.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.711
Come on, Kryten.

21:46.040 --> 21:51.319
He's acting strangely. It might have affected
his mind when you chewed his light-bee.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.432
I'll do more than chew his light-bee
when we get out!

21:54.640 --> 21:56.517
Kryten!

21:58.240 --> 22:02.995
Thank you very much.
You've been wonderful prisoners, you really have.

22:04.880 --> 22:10.671
Well, I don't know about the enemy,
but you certainly scare the hell out of me!

22:10.840 --> 22:13.149
Let's get this show on the road.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.835
Company... advance!

22:17.040 --> 22:20.476
Kryten.

22:20.680 --> 22:24.275
You know what you have to do.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.478
- Let's go, Holly.
- OK, matey.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.311
Oh... shot!

23:03.880 --> 23:06.189
Destroy them! Shoot them!

23:19.560 --> 23:23.473
Iron Duke? Iron Duke? This is Pawn Sacrifice.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.438
- Come in, please.
- Kryten, how's it going?

23:26.600 --> 23:29.353
I'm in the Third Reich building.
Minimal resistance.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.195
Just as you planned,
the decoy charge has drawn their fire.

23:33.360 --> 23:37.035
OK, Now find the boiler room
and hit the thermostat,

23:37.200 --> 23:40.192
They'll melt once it hits 100 degrees,

23:40.360 --> 23:42.476
I'm on my way, sir.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.876
Victory, gentlemen! The fascists have fallen.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.390
- May I untie them now, sir?
- Rejoice. We conquer!

23:51.560 --> 23:55.155
Victory on Waxworld! It's VW Day!

23:55.800 --> 23:59.031
- So you wiped them all out?
- To a droid.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.158
- It's true. All melted.
- What about Arnie's army?

24:02.320 --> 24:07.314
- Yeah, how many of them made it back?
- There are always casualties in war,

24:07.480 --> 24:11.519
otherwise it wouldn't be war,
just a nasty argument with pushing and shoving.

24:12.240 --> 24:17.189
- How many survived?
- Well, we haven't made a full estimate,

24:17.360 --> 24:21.717
but at a rough guess -
and obviously this is subject to alteration -

24:21.880 --> 24:23.916
round about none of them.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.315
You wiped out the population of this planet?

24:26.520 --> 24:29.910
You make it sound so negative. Don't you see?

24:30.120 --> 24:33.396
The deranged menace
that threatened this world is vanquished.

24:33.600 --> 24:36.478
No, it isn't, pal. You're still here.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.712
I brought about peace.
Peace, freedom and democracy.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.956
Yeah, Rimmer. Right. Absolutely.

24:42.120 --> 24:47.877
Now those corpses can lie there, safe
in the knowledge that they snuffed it for peace,

24:48.040 --> 24:53.353
and can now happily decompose
in a land of freedom... you smeg-head.

24:53.720 --> 24:55.870
There's no pleasing some people, is there?

24:56.080 --> 24:58.548
At least we got the Matter Paddle back.

24:58.720 --> 25:01.757
Well, there's nothing to stay here for.
Let's get back.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.032
Shouldn't we go and bask in the glow of victory?

25:05.240 --> 25:07.435
Holly, give me his light-bee.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.673
- See you, Rimmer.
- Sir! What are you thinking of?

25:15.360 --> 25:18.193
It's OK. He'll come out in a couple a days...

25:19.880 --> 25:22.758
.. and he'll have been through
what he put us through.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.956
Does any one fancy a vindaloo?

25:29.600 --> 25:32.637
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

25:32.800 --> 25:35.951
# I'm all alone, more or less

25:36.120 --> 25:39.715
# Let me fly far away from here

25:39.880 --> 25:42.155
# Fun, fun, fun

25:42.320 --> 25:45.995
# In the sun, sun, sun

25:46.160 --> 25:49.709
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose

25:49.880 --> 25:52.713
# Drinking fresh mango juice

25:52.880 --> 25:56.509
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

25:56.680 --> 25:58.955
# Fun, fun, fun

25:59.120 --> 26:02.669
# In the sun, sun, sun

26:02.840 --> 26:05.798
# I said fun, fun, fun

26:05.960 --> 26:09.669
# In the sun, sun, sun #

26:09.840 --> 26:12.149
Huh! Great to be back!

26:12.680 --> 26:14.079
Huh!

26:17.160 --> 26:19.151
