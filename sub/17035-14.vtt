WEBVTT

00:07.952 --> 00:10.186
This is taking forever.

00:10.288 --> 00:11.487
You sure you don't want to
just go outside

00:11.589 --> 00:12.555
and fill it up with the hose?

00:12.657 --> 00:14.156
I don't want hose spaghetti.

00:14.259 --> 00:15.124
Why not?

00:15.226 --> 00:16.525
You had hose coffee this morning.

00:16.628 --> 00:18.388
Are we gonna be eating anytime soon?

00:18.490 --> 00:19.629
I'd hate to have to let the state know

00:19.731 --> 00:21.097
you're feeding me dinner this late.

00:21.199 --> 00:22.978
I believe you two still have
a file open.

00:26.371 --> 00:28.004
That's the sound it made
right before my half-shower

00:28.106 --> 00:28.871
this morning.

00:28.973 --> 00:31.507
- Okay, here we go.
- Whoo!

00:31.609 --> 00:35.578
Come on, baby. Mama needs some s'ghetti!

00:41.386 --> 00:43.586
We should probably go down there.

00:43.655 --> 00:45.421
Or we could never go down there again.

00:52.030 --> 00:53.829
Damn it!

00:56.434 --> 00:57.366
Mom, I need your help.

00:57.468 --> 00:58.534
Not a great time right now, Brick.

00:58.636 --> 01:01.070
I need to turn in my history
paper online by 9:00,

01:01.172 --> 01:02.438
and that's in five minutes.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.873
Mom? Mom?!

01:03.975 --> 01:05.174
Are you even listening to me?

01:05.275 --> 01:06.342
No, Brick, I'm really not.

01:06.444 --> 01:08.010
Kind of in the middle of something here.

01:08.112 --> 01:09.145
Frankie!

01:09.247 --> 01:10.846
But the website
isn't letting me turn it in.

01:10.949 --> 01:12.214
It's 50% of my grade.

01:12.317 --> 01:14.250
Yeah, well, 50% of the basement
is under water, Brick,

01:14.352 --> 01:16.052
so you're gonna have to
figure it out yourself.

01:16.154 --> 01:17.186
What?!

01:17.288 --> 01:18.487
What the hell you doing up there?

01:18.589 --> 01:19.388
I'm getting towels!

01:19.490 --> 01:20.589
Forget the towels!

01:20.692 --> 01:22.291
You got to turn off the water
at the source!

01:22.393 --> 01:24.160
At the what? At the source. The source!

01:24.262 --> 01:25.828
I don't even know what that means!

01:25.930 --> 01:28.464
Mom, there's only four minutes
now until the deadline.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.967
Mom? Mom? Mom?

01:31.035 --> 01:32.068
Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad?

01:32.170 --> 01:33.803
How can you not know what the source is?

01:33.905 --> 01:35.204
You got to know this stuff, Frankie.

01:35.306 --> 01:36.339
What if I was dead?

01:36.441 --> 01:38.641
Then my new rich husband
would hire me a plumber.

01:38.743 --> 01:40.309
What's the matter with this door?

01:40.411 --> 01:42.011
Can't one thing in this house work?

01:42.113 --> 01:42.745
I put the mop handle in there.

01:42.847 --> 01:44.146
What? Why?

01:44.248 --> 01:46.749
Because Nancy Donahue said
there's been break-ins lately.

01:46.851 --> 01:49.118
And you're worried someone's
gonna steal all this?

01:49.220 --> 01:51.087
You're a ridiculous woman,
you know that?

01:51.189 --> 01:53.189
Yeah, you better walk off.

01:53.291 --> 01:54.590
I can't believe this is happening.

01:54.692 --> 01:56.759
You know how hard it was
to write a five-page paper

01:56.861 --> 01:58.594
on the Louisiana Purchase
using a computer

01:58.696 --> 02:00.096
that doesn't have the letter "L"?

02:00.198 --> 02:01.464
All right. I did it.

02:01.566 --> 02:03.666
And the handle snapped off in my hand.

02:03.768 --> 02:05.134
Don't just stand there. Help us.

02:05.236 --> 02:07.036
Brick can't get his homework
on the website.

02:07.138 --> 02:09.038
Bigger fish to fry right now, Frankie.

02:09.139 --> 02:11.841
Just print it out and hand it in
to the teacher tomorrow.

02:11.943 --> 02:13.209
They don't let them hand it in,

02:13.311 --> 02:14.744
they have to upload it to Cyberdesk.

02:14.846 --> 02:16.746
When I was a kid,
we didn't have computers.

02:16.848 --> 02:17.780
Nobody had computers.

02:17.882 --> 02:19.382
All we had were pencils and paper

02:19.484 --> 02:20.616
and we all turned out fine.

02:20.718 --> 02:22.551
Save your stories
for the campfire, Grandpa.

02:22.653 --> 02:24.053
Right now I'm trying to make sure

02:24.155 --> 02:25.287
our son doesn't fail history.

02:25.390 --> 02:26.922
Yeah, well, maybe if
you were more on top of it,

02:27.025 --> 02:29.058
he wouldn't always be doing
everything at the last minute.

02:29.994 --> 02:31.560
Excuse me?

02:31.662 --> 02:35.064
Are you saying it's my job to
make sure Brick's on top of it?

02:35.166 --> 02:37.233
Well, homework is your department.

02:37.335 --> 02:39.335
Oh, lucky me, how did I get that job?

02:39.437 --> 02:41.137
Oh, right, I have all the jobs.

02:41.239 --> 02:42.104
Oh, really?

02:42.206 --> 02:43.339
Do you change the oil in the cars?

02:43.441 --> 02:44.707
Do you shovel the driveway?

02:44.809 --> 02:46.609
Do you know where
the main water valve is?

02:46.711 --> 02:49.478
Hate to interrupt, but I have
57 seconds to get this in.

02:49.580 --> 02:50.946
54!

02:51.049 --> 02:52.615
Really, Mike? You really want to have

02:52.717 --> 02:54.150
the "Who does more around here"
argument?

02:54.252 --> 02:55.551
I don't think you do.

02:55.653 --> 02:57.086
I don't think you do 'cause you
know I'd be winning.

02:57.188 --> 02:58.387
48.

02:58.489 --> 03:01.397
I'm sorry, but maybe you're
just too busy watching TV

03:01.499 --> 03:03.659
and endlessly brushing
your teeth to see what I do.

03:03.761 --> 03:05.490
Because I have to be responsible
for knowing

03:05.592 --> 03:07.532
everybody's schedule,
I'm doing all the cooking...

03:07.557 --> 03:08.455
Oh, really?

03:08.533 --> 03:10.199
How many Burger Barn punch cards

03:10.301 --> 03:12.501
have we blown through
this year, huh? Chef?

03:12.570 --> 03:13.801
I didn't see you complaining
when you were

03:13.826 --> 03:15.571
shoving it in your big,
dumb face, you dummy.

03:17.642 --> 03:18.841
That's it. It's over.

03:18.943 --> 03:21.410
Cyberdesk is no longer
accepting documents.

03:21.512 --> 03:24.447
Why does everything have to be
in the stupid cloud anyway?

03:24.549 --> 03:26.082
His homework's in a cloud.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.716
Our pictures are in a cloud.

03:27.819 --> 03:29.285
No, I printed them out like you said

03:29.387 --> 03:30.920
and put them in a box in the basement.

03:31.022 --> 03:32.555
Oh, my God, the basement.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.562
People always say
a new day brings new hope.

03:39.664 --> 03:40.563
People are wrong.

03:40.665 --> 03:42.500
Where do you want this?

03:43.668 --> 03:45.169
There's good.

03:45.970 --> 03:48.170
Hey, Brick, did you e-mail your teacher

03:48.272 --> 03:51.040
and tell her what happened
with your history paper?

03:51.109 --> 03:53.275
Oh, I read it wrong.

03:53.344 --> 03:56.433
Turns out the paper's not due
till 9:00 P.M. Tuesday.

03:59.317 --> 04:02.173
Hey, I didn't know
you guys were coming home.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.086
- Your dad and I were just...
- Save it.

04:04.155 --> 04:05.921
I don't want to hear
about your weird role playing.

04:05.948 --> 04:07.181
Brick texted us.

04:07.249 --> 04:09.616
He said there's some kind of
a situation.

04:09.685 --> 04:12.246
Yeah, there's definitely a situation.

04:12.348 --> 04:14.558
Well, we're here to help.

04:16.358 --> 04:18.625
Wait, I don't think we're talking about

04:18.728 --> 04:20.135
the same situation.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.392
What's going on?

04:21.481 --> 04:24.439
I think this is more
of a family room conversation.

04:24.541 --> 04:25.399
Yeah.

04:29.847 --> 04:31.981
Unless somebody's pregnant
or failing out of school,

04:32.083 --> 04:32.948
we got stuff to do.

04:33.050 --> 04:34.350
Oh, someone's failing, all right.

04:34.418 --> 04:36.285
- But it's in the school of parenting.
- Mm-hmm.

04:36.354 --> 04:37.935
Please sit.

04:42.799 --> 04:44.398
Here's the thing...
Brick reached out to us

04:44.467 --> 04:46.100
because he's upset
about some of the things

04:46.169 --> 04:47.568
that have been going on around here.

04:47.604 --> 04:49.904
And after hearing his cries for help,

04:50.006 --> 04:52.006
Sue and I felt we had no choice

04:52.075 --> 04:54.609
but to come home
and speak on his behalf.

04:54.677 --> 04:57.078
Speak on his behalf about what?

04:57.113 --> 05:00.085
You two... the fighting, the bickering,

05:00.154 --> 05:02.474
the constant barbs
at each other's expense.

05:02.543 --> 05:04.524
The eye rolling, the rude hand gestures

05:04.549 --> 05:05.815
behind each others' backs.

05:05.884 --> 05:08.317
I hear the term "crazy woman" was used?

05:08.386 --> 05:10.186
It was actually "ridiculous woman."

05:10.288 --> 05:11.454
Thank you, Brick.

05:11.523 --> 05:14.457
I was also informed
that Mom called Dad a dummy

05:14.526 --> 05:17.226
and Dad shook a mop
in front of Mom's face.

05:17.328 --> 05:19.262
I believe what I learned in church

05:19.330 --> 05:21.764
was there are better ways
to express oneself

05:21.866 --> 05:23.799
than mop-shaking and name-calling.

05:23.868 --> 05:26.969
Okay, I don't know
where this is coming from.

05:27.038 --> 05:29.639
Your dad and I are very much in love.

05:30.507 --> 05:32.040
Hmm, how do I put this?

05:32.067 --> 05:37.151
Um, Brick is a plant,
and the terrarium of your anger

05:37.187 --> 05:39.505
is poisoning the soil
with which he needs to grow.

05:39.607 --> 05:40.707
Mm-hmm.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.809
Look, I know this is a lot to process,

05:42.877 --> 05:45.044
but the important thing is
that you've heard it

05:45.113 --> 05:47.180
and, moving forward,
you'll try to do better.

05:47.248 --> 05:49.615
It's not all on you.
I feel partly responsible

05:49.718 --> 05:51.584
for not being home on a daily basis

05:51.686 --> 05:52.919
to point out your flaws.

05:52.987 --> 05:55.156
Is that everything, Brick?

05:55.225 --> 05:56.289
Is there anything else
you would like to add?

05:56.391 --> 05:58.524
No. Thank you.

05:58.593 --> 06:01.694
I think this was really productive.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.970
Oh, yeah.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.927
Oh, come on. No crying.

06:09.996 --> 06:12.163
This house is wet enough as it is.

06:12.198 --> 06:15.366
I'm sorry, but our kids just
gave us an intervention.

06:15.435 --> 06:17.468
It wasn't an intervention.

06:17.570 --> 06:18.669
Wha...?

06:18.738 --> 06:21.360
They both got up
before 10:00 A.M. on a Saturday

06:21.385 --> 06:22.984
and drove over here without
their laundry...

06:23.053 --> 06:23.985
that's an intervention.

06:24.087 --> 06:26.021
There's a show on TV
called "Intervention,"

06:26.089 --> 06:27.859
and that's pretty much
exactly what happens.

06:27.961 --> 06:29.858
Look, if Brick had a problem with us,

06:29.927 --> 06:31.993
he didn't have to go
tattle on us to those two.

06:32.029 --> 06:34.195
He could've just come to us
and said something.

06:34.231 --> 06:36.431
Well, obviously,
he didn't feel comfortable

06:36.500 --> 06:38.300
doing that because we're monsters.

06:38.368 --> 06:42.003
We yell at each other and his
soil is getting damaged and...

06:42.072 --> 06:43.004
Don't look at me.

06:43.106 --> 06:44.506
You're really more of the yeller.

06:44.608 --> 06:48.045
Oh, okay, maybe, but you have
more of that seethy anger.

06:48.113 --> 06:50.612
You know, most of your
serial killers have that.

06:51.915 --> 06:54.223
We have to be better.

06:54.325 --> 06:55.313
Ugh.

06:55.338 --> 06:56.420
No, I'm serious.

06:56.445 --> 06:58.885
Our kids came to us
and expressed concern

06:58.910 --> 07:00.810
in a mature and articulate way,

07:00.879 --> 07:02.745
and we have to respond in kind

07:02.814 --> 07:05.464
by role modeling good behavior.

07:06.022 --> 07:07.788
I think we should apologize to them.

07:08.491 --> 07:10.024
We've been married for over 20 years.

07:10.092 --> 07:12.426
I think we should get a free
pass on having a little dust-up.

07:12.495 --> 07:13.494
Come on, Mike.

07:13.596 --> 07:15.930
Let's show our kids we're better.

07:15.998 --> 07:19.625
Let's show them we're big enough
to admit when we're wrong.

07:22.738 --> 07:25.172
Does that mean you think I'm right?

07:26.642 --> 07:29.076
Aw!

07:29.656 --> 07:30.988
What are laughing at?

07:31.057 --> 07:33.524
Guy just threw a boomerang
and hit himself in the junk.

07:33.626 --> 07:34.625
You?

07:34.694 --> 07:36.027
Charlie Rose just said something pithy.

07:36.129 --> 07:37.328
Oh, yeah.

07:37.430 --> 07:38.396
Hey, guys.

07:38.498 --> 07:39.630
Dad and I want to
talk to you for a minute.

07:39.732 --> 07:41.699
Sue, get in here.

07:41.801 --> 07:42.867
What's up?

07:44.437 --> 07:47.605
So your Dad and I have something to say.

07:49.209 --> 07:50.441
We're sorry.

07:50.543 --> 07:53.277
We thought about what you guys
said and you're right.

07:53.379 --> 07:56.214
We have not been behaving
in a way that we're proud of.

07:56.282 --> 07:58.650
And we are gonna be better.

07:59.752 --> 08:00.718
Okay, then.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.220
I think that was
really healthy and good.

08:02.322 --> 08:04.555
And, again, thank you for coming to us.

08:04.624 --> 08:07.472
And know that our door is always open.

08:11.598 --> 08:12.797
Wow.

08:12.866 --> 08:15.800
Our parents just apologized
to us from their hearts.

08:15.902 --> 08:17.168
Do you know what this means?

08:17.270 --> 08:18.469
We have them at our mercy.

08:18.571 --> 08:19.871
Now, what do we want?

08:24.376 --> 08:25.309
Guys, trust me.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.181
I am a business major who attended

08:27.206 --> 08:28.572
nearly half his classes.

08:28.607 --> 08:32.408
What we have here is something
the French call leverage.

08:32.501 --> 08:34.001
What are you talking about?

08:34.071 --> 08:35.102
What I'm talking about is Mom and Dad

08:35.172 --> 08:36.471
are feeling pretty guilty
right about now,

08:36.539 --> 08:38.440
so it's a great time to try to
get something out of them.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.008
You know, it's like a chicken place.

08:40.077 --> 08:41.876
They have the power
because you want chicken

08:41.945 --> 08:44.044
and they have the chicken,
so you have to pay them,

08:44.114 --> 08:46.053
but if I find
a half a rat in my chicken,

08:46.135 --> 08:47.840
mnh-mnh, they got to pay me.

08:47.901 --> 08:48.933
I have the power.

08:49.002 --> 08:51.302
The entire power balance has shifted.

08:51.371 --> 08:54.207
So you're saying Mom and Dad
just gave us half a rat?

08:54.309 --> 08:55.373
Exactly.

08:55.408 --> 08:58.636
And now the question is,
what do they have that we want?

08:58.738 --> 09:00.283
Mm, this would be a lot easier

09:00.385 --> 09:01.649
if we had rich parents.

09:01.683 --> 09:03.016
Ooh, maybe we could ask each of them

09:03.085 --> 09:04.851
to give us a kidney,
sell it on the black market.

09:04.953 --> 09:06.052
'Course, there are three of us,

09:06.154 --> 09:07.654
so one of us would not
be getting a kidney.

09:07.723 --> 09:09.744
- Let me guess.
- Yeah, sorry, Brick.

09:09.813 --> 09:11.358
But maybe Sue an go halfsies
with you on her kidney.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.866
We're not harvesting
our parents' organs!

09:13.891 --> 09:15.390
Well, we got to do something!

09:15.425 --> 09:16.591
We're wasting valuable time here.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.193
Who knows how long
this goodwill is gonna last?

09:18.295 --> 09:19.427
We could be one sweat sock

09:19.463 --> 09:20.829
on the table away
from blowing this whole thing.

09:20.898 --> 09:22.564
Huh!

09:22.599 --> 09:24.266
They've never taken us
on a good vacation.

09:24.368 --> 09:25.233
Huh, right?

09:25.302 --> 09:26.501
I mean, I'm not talking about

09:26.570 --> 09:27.936
South Dakota for Aunt Edie's funeral.

09:28.005 --> 09:30.038
I'm not talking about Kentucky
for Dad's lame-o caves.

09:30.140 --> 09:33.708
I am talking about a real beach vacay.

09:35.078 --> 09:37.145
What about the Florida Keys?

09:37.214 --> 09:39.414
Carly went there once,
and she brought me back

09:39.483 --> 09:41.983
a pen where if you turned it
upside down, the sun sets.

09:42.052 --> 09:43.084
Think about it.

09:43.153 --> 09:44.858
We could get one of those fancy motels

09:44.927 --> 09:46.584
where you can drive
right up to your door.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.588
And you can see headlights stream

09:48.613 --> 09:49.813
across the wall when you sleep?

09:49.881 --> 09:51.514
And I can pet one of Hemingway's cats!

09:51.616 --> 09:52.582
Yes!

09:52.684 --> 09:53.881
What?

09:54.319 --> 09:55.785
Legend has it that a sea captain

09:55.887 --> 09:57.787
gave Ernest Hemingway
a white six-toed cat,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.355
and now the Florida Keys...

09:59.458 --> 10:00.590
Stop.

10:00.659 --> 10:02.092
You had me at six-toed cat.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.862
We're going clockwise.

10:05.931 --> 10:08.164
My clockwise or your clockwise?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.904
There's only one clockwise.

10:09.929 --> 10:12.196
Whatever, Big Ben, just tell me
which way to go.

10:12.298 --> 10:14.431
Hey. Oh, we were just talking.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.966
We weren't fighting. What's up?

10:16.035 --> 10:18.669
Well, we just wanted to say thanks again

10:18.737 --> 10:19.803
for apologizing.

10:19.872 --> 10:22.272
Yeah, and, um, in the spirit of healing,

10:22.341 --> 10:24.708
we were thinking
one way to repair our family

10:24.777 --> 10:27.244
and for you guys to make us
all feel better is,

10:27.313 --> 10:28.579
um, well, you know what?

10:29.202 --> 10:31.610
Brick is the youngest
and the most traumatized,

10:31.635 --> 10:32.865
so why don't we let him tell you?

10:32.890 --> 10:33.835
Brick.

10:33.937 --> 10:35.270
Ice cream sandwiches?

10:35.339 --> 10:37.205
You didn't tell me I was gonna talk.

10:37.241 --> 10:38.940
We all agreed on Florida, Brick.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.742
All you had to say was "Florida."

10:40.844 --> 10:42.077
Well, I'm sorry.

10:42.145 --> 10:44.170
I was thinking about Florida,
and I was on the beach

10:44.238 --> 10:46.381
petting Hemingway's cats,
and it was hot.

10:46.450 --> 10:47.849
And I thought how nice it would be

10:47.918 --> 10:49.150
to have an ice cream sandwich.

10:49.219 --> 10:51.152
Yeah, but why would you
ask for something

10:51.221 --> 10:53.121
you can just go to the freezer and take?

10:53.156 --> 10:55.857
I thought you had to ask
to have an ice cream sandwich.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.290
No! No!

10:57.337 --> 10:58.136
Really?!

10:58.205 --> 10:59.671
Oh, great, now we're eating

10:59.740 --> 11:02.107
ice cream sandwiches
instead of going to Florida.

11:02.209 --> 11:04.042
They're not even the full size.
They're the cuties.

11:04.144 --> 11:06.011
'Cause Mom's always thinking
she's got to lose weight.

11:06.079 --> 11:07.165
So what's the plan?

11:07.267 --> 11:08.277
There is no plan.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.478
You blew it.

11:09.580 --> 11:10.682
The universe gave us a half a rat,

11:10.784 --> 11:12.584
and instead of
a million-dollar settlement,

11:12.653 --> 11:14.352
we settled for a free bucket of chicken.

11:14.454 --> 11:18.477
We lost, and once again,
Mom and Dad are the winners.

11:18.659 --> 11:21.826
Is this rag or a towel?

11:21.895 --> 11:26.701
Uh, it's either a really nice
rag or a really gross towel.

11:26.795 --> 11:29.095
It's kind of sad
we can't tell the difference.

11:29.197 --> 11:30.592
All right, I'm just gonna go up

11:30.695 --> 11:32.665
and throw these in the dryer.

11:32.861 --> 11:34.027
If you put them in the dryer,

11:34.096 --> 11:35.962
everything we dry
is gonna smell like dirty rag.

11:36.031 --> 11:37.864
Says the guy who never does the laundry.

11:37.966 --> 11:39.566
Let's see you sharpen
the lawnmower blades.

11:39.635 --> 11:41.101
You don't want me holding a sharp blade

11:41.126 --> 11:42.068
in my hand right now.

11:42.170 --> 11:43.270
You'd be doing me a favor.

11:43.338 --> 11:44.404
Oh, my God. The kids are right.

11:44.506 --> 11:45.872
We're like the Bickersons.

11:45.941 --> 11:48.008
No wonder poor Brick was traumatized.

11:48.076 --> 11:49.142
Poor Brick?

11:49.244 --> 11:50.910
We wouldn't have been
fighting in the first place

11:50.979 --> 11:52.045
if it wasn't for "poor Brick."

11:52.147 --> 11:53.079
That's true.

11:53.148 --> 11:54.748
Without his whole homework fiasco,

11:54.816 --> 11:56.316
you and I would have been having

11:56.418 --> 11:58.714
a very pleasant evening
bailing filthy water

11:58.739 --> 11:59.849
out of our basement.

11:59.874 --> 12:02.555
Followed by a romantic
hose-spaghetti dinner.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.113
You know, when you think of it,

12:04.215 --> 12:06.048
most of our fights are because of them.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.850
Remember last week, you got mad at me

12:07.919 --> 12:10.019
'cause Sue guilted me into
going to her college

12:10.088 --> 12:13.005
and bringing up her "It's Kitten
Time Somewhere" poster?

12:13.074 --> 12:14.156
How 'bout the time Brick swallowed

12:14.192 --> 12:15.157
all that Jell-O powder?

12:15.260 --> 12:16.592
We practically went 12 rounds

12:16.694 --> 12:18.861
'cause you wanted to take him
to the emergency room,

12:18.930 --> 12:21.507
and I said it's gonna be Sue's
$300 fart all over again.

12:21.576 --> 12:22.698
I mean, if it weren't for those kids,

12:22.767 --> 12:24.506
we'd be the happiest couple in town.

12:24.575 --> 12:26.672
And where do they get off
coming into our house

12:26.697 --> 12:28.297
- and telling us how to parent?
- Yeah.

12:28.365 --> 12:30.332
And then we end up apologizing to them.

12:30.434 --> 12:31.633
You know, when we were kids,

12:31.669 --> 12:33.235
you didn't tell your parents
what they were doing wrong.

12:33.304 --> 12:35.037
You know what you did?
You ate your vegetables.

12:35.139 --> 12:36.605
I have a good mind to buy vegetables

12:36.707 --> 12:37.973
and make those kids eat them.

12:38.075 --> 12:39.904
Oh, we're gonna do a lot more than that.

12:40.444 --> 12:41.610
- But we...
- Listen up.

12:41.712 --> 12:44.012
We know we just said we're
sorry, but we're not sorry.

12:44.114 --> 12:45.376
And I'll tell you something else...

12:45.478 --> 12:47.149
what we have here is just fine.

12:47.251 --> 12:49.541
We're very much in love.
This is working.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.765
But you know what's not working?

12:50.790 --> 12:51.611
You guys.

12:51.636 --> 12:53.024
- Nice segue, honey.
- Thanks, babe.

12:53.126 --> 12:54.158
We're down in the basement

12:54.260 --> 12:55.593
busting our butts and you're up here

12:55.695 --> 12:57.295
eating ice cream sandwiches
that we paid for

12:57.397 --> 12:58.462
with our hard-earned money.

12:58.564 --> 12:59.597
Well, guess what.

12:59.666 --> 13:02.500
The free ride ends here. Let's go.

13:04.248 --> 13:05.280
Move, move.

13:05.382 --> 13:06.615
Come on, heel-toe, heel-toe.

13:06.683 --> 13:08.250
Can't we at least discuss this?

13:08.318 --> 13:08.917
What did we even do?

13:09.052 --> 13:09.985
Nothing to discuss.

13:10.087 --> 13:11.787
We're right, you're wrong. Not sorry.

13:14.224 --> 13:16.858
We are so, so sorry.

13:21.379 --> 13:22.512
This is amazing.

13:22.581 --> 13:25.533
Uh, how is this amazing, exactly?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.641
Another half a rat
just fell in our laps.

13:27.709 --> 13:29.275
It was a one-in-a-million shot,
and this time,

13:29.344 --> 13:31.011
we're not settling for
the free bucket of chicken.

13:31.079 --> 13:32.746
We're going for something much bigger.

13:32.814 --> 13:34.347
You mean like Mallomars?

13:34.416 --> 13:36.249
Dude, for the last time,
you are in high school.

13:36.284 --> 13:37.684
You can take snacks without asking.

13:37.786 --> 13:39.100
- Ding Dongs?
- Yes.

13:39.125 --> 13:39.786
Pretzels?

13:39.888 --> 13:40.787
- Yes!
- Yes!

13:40.822 --> 13:42.055
You're blowing my mind.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.031
I don't know, you guys.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.192
I'm really starting to
feel bad for Mom and Dad.

13:46.696 --> 13:48.062
You feel bad for the people

13:48.131 --> 13:50.298
that threw your little brother
down the stairs?

13:50.366 --> 13:51.499
They didn't throw him.

13:51.568 --> 13:53.134
If anything, you bumped him.

13:53.203 --> 13:54.535
Oh, tomato, potahto.

13:54.604 --> 13:56.208
Plus, they did apologize.

13:56.277 --> 13:58.039
And they do feel really bad for Brick.

13:58.074 --> 14:00.274
Stop right there. Do not give
them human qualities.

14:00.343 --> 14:01.409
We can't do what we need to do

14:01.478 --> 14:02.677
if we think of them as people.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.967
Ugh, I feel horrible about Brick.

14:07.036 --> 14:08.328
I mean, we might as well have just

14:08.430 --> 14:09.252
thrown him down the stairs.

14:09.277 --> 14:10.310
That's what we did...

14:10.378 --> 14:12.112
we threw him down the stairs
with our words.

14:12.180 --> 14:14.147
You know that's going in the file.

14:14.216 --> 14:15.949
I'm disappointed in us, Mike.

14:16.051 --> 14:17.217
You know, first chance we got,

14:17.252 --> 14:18.718
we went right back to our yell-y selves.

14:18.754 --> 14:21.321
And they don't deserve that.
They are great kids.

14:21.854 --> 14:23.554
All I know is not one of our great kids

14:23.623 --> 14:25.189
even thought about coming down here

14:25.258 --> 14:26.857
to help us until we yelled at them.

14:26.893 --> 14:27.962
And I'll tell you something else...

14:28.030 --> 14:30.294
when I was a kid,
I would never have dreamed

14:30.363 --> 14:31.862
of giving my dad parenting advice.

14:31.965 --> 14:33.998
And he sure the hell
didn't want my opinion.

14:34.067 --> 14:36.112
If I was sitting in his chair,

14:36.185 --> 14:38.054
he wouldn't even ask me to
move... he'd just sit on me.

14:38.079 --> 14:40.191
See, now you're getting
all worked up again.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.246
That's exactly what
we're trying to avoid.

14:42.281 --> 14:44.815
We need to stay cool,
just keep doing our work,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.549
and let the kids realize on their own

14:47.585 --> 14:49.366
that they should come down and help.

14:49.435 --> 14:54.058
Trust me, Mike, role modeling
good behavior will work.

14:54.859 --> 14:56.325
It didn't.

14:56.428 --> 14:57.460
Hey.

14:57.529 --> 14:59.341
I got Brick all settled into his room.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.697
I was wondering if you guys
needed any help.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.387
Thank you, Sue. Thank you so much.

15:04.412 --> 15:06.118
Yeah, you can start by hanging

15:06.186 --> 15:07.692
some of those old photos to dry.

15:07.761 --> 15:10.602
Don't worry about saving any
from my perm years.

15:14.026 --> 15:16.126
See? I knew it would work.

15:16.195 --> 15:17.428
Yeah, for the easy one.

15:17.530 --> 15:19.029
I n't see Axl down here.

15:19.098 --> 15:21.298
All right, we might have to
give him a little more time.

15:21.367 --> 15:22.833
Yeah, or we can give him no more time

15:22.935 --> 15:24.601
and I can just go up there
and punish him.

15:24.703 --> 15:26.837
Yeah, right.

15:27.104 --> 15:27.970
You're serious?

15:28.072 --> 15:29.104
Damn right I'm serious.

15:29.173 --> 15:31.006
You're gonna punish your
23-year-old son.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.307
How are you gonna do that?

15:32.376 --> 15:34.142
Go to the college and tell the president

15:34.178 --> 15:35.911
of the university he can't have dessert?

15:35.980 --> 15:37.980
I'll take his phone away.

15:38.048 --> 15:39.777
You can't do that. We're bundled.

15:39.802 --> 15:41.068
It'll unravel our whole plan.

15:41.103 --> 15:42.469
Plus, if he doesn't have a phone,

15:42.538 --> 15:43.937
we'll never hear from him again.

15:44.302 --> 15:46.268
Well, then he can't
do laundry here anymore.

15:46.337 --> 15:47.503
He does it at Sue's now.

15:48.451 --> 15:50.018
He can forget about staying here
for the summer.

15:50.086 --> 15:52.887
Said the other day if he had to
stay here, he'd die.

15:52.956 --> 15:54.489
Okay, look, you can stay down here

15:54.591 --> 15:55.923
and role model all you want,

15:55.992 --> 15:58.126
but I'm not gonna tip-toe
around my kids anymore.

15:58.194 --> 16:00.412
I don't care how old he is.
I'm still in charge.

16:00.437 --> 16:01.603
He's gonna listen to me.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.372
And if he's in my chair,
I'm gonna sit right on him.

16:09.279 --> 16:12.814
Well, look who decided to go out
and get themselves a snack.

16:12.883 --> 16:13.648
What? You know what?

16:13.717 --> 16:14.716
Being a part of a family

16:14.785 --> 16:16.128
means stepping up and helping out

16:16.153 --> 16:17.352
when something goes wrong.

16:17.387 --> 16:18.887
Your mom and I are
busting our butts downstairs.

16:18.956 --> 16:20.534
Hell, your sister's even down there.

16:20.559 --> 16:21.757
- But I...
- But nothing!

16:21.826 --> 16:23.091
I don't want to hear
anything out of your mouth

16:23.193 --> 16:24.559
unless it's "I'm sorry," and, of course,

16:24.628 --> 16:26.194
it'll be a cold day in Hell
before that happens.

16:26.263 --> 16:27.496
What are you talking about?

16:27.564 --> 16:28.897
I say I'm sorry all the time.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.766
God, I'm sorry!

16:30.868 --> 16:32.067
Sorry!

16:32.136 --> 16:34.970
Oh, I'm so, so sorry.

16:35.005 --> 16:37.806
Okay, so maybe I'm not
the best at apologizing,

16:37.875 --> 16:39.385
but at least I try.

16:39.908 --> 16:40.796
What's that supposed to mean?

16:40.864 --> 16:42.297
I'm just saying you never apologize.

16:42.399 --> 16:43.966
Maybe I learned it from you.

16:44.508 --> 16:45.808
I apologize.

16:45.876 --> 16:48.110
I apologized to you five hours ago.

16:48.179 --> 16:50.079
No, Mom apologized.

16:50.147 --> 16:51.613
You just stood there.

16:51.716 --> 16:53.048
You never say you're sorry.

16:53.084 --> 16:56.485
Dad, you ate the other half of
the sandwich I was saving.

16:56.587 --> 16:57.653
I bought it.

16:57.722 --> 17:00.155
Dad, you were supposed to
pick me up an hour ago.

17:00.224 --> 17:02.024
When I was a kid, we walked home.

17:02.093 --> 17:03.859
Catch.

17:04.442 --> 17:05.141
Ow?

17:05.210 --> 17:07.018
I said, "Catch."

17:08.179 --> 17:09.579
- Well, I...
- It's okay.

17:09.681 --> 17:10.946
Look, I know it's hard for you

17:10.972 --> 17:12.748
to show your feelings
'cause of, you know,

17:13.195 --> 17:14.128
the way you were raised.

17:14.154 --> 17:15.186
You don't like to be vulnerable.

17:15.256 --> 17:16.255
And let's face it,

17:16.323 --> 17:17.990
apologizing is a very
vulnerable thing to do,

17:18.058 --> 17:20.157
but even though you never say
you're sorry, I mean,

17:20.261 --> 17:21.425
you show it in other ways.

17:21.529 --> 17:22.594
Yeah.

17:22.925 --> 17:24.691
Well, we're getting away from the point.

17:24.760 --> 17:26.926
And the point is that
we've got a flooded basement

17:26.996 --> 17:28.796
and you're out
getting yourself a burger.

17:28.864 --> 17:30.430
Well, actually,
I was getting everybody burgers.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.332
Oh? Oh.

17:32.401 --> 17:33.867
Well, that was nice.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.169
But it doesn't change the fact

17:35.194 --> 17:37.552
that you should've
come down and helped...

17:37.577 --> 17:38.543
A lot sooner?

17:38.578 --> 17:40.178
Yeah, you're right. I should have.

17:40.213 --> 17:41.679
I realized that
when I was standing in line

17:41.748 --> 17:42.914
at the burger place plotting about

17:43.016 --> 17:44.148
what I could get out of you guys.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.050
And I look up, I see the deep-fried

17:46.119 --> 17:48.286
family feed bag for $5.99,
and I'm thinking,

17:48.909 --> 17:50.633
you'd probably buy us that, right?

17:50.702 --> 17:51.969
'Cause you're always thinking about us

17:52.036 --> 17:53.368
and whether we need fried things.

17:53.437 --> 17:55.539
Anyway, that's why I got
everybody dinner.

17:55.652 --> 17:57.151
That's also why I picked up a wet vac

17:57.345 --> 17:58.306
'cause I thought that might make

17:58.409 --> 17:59.877
the clean-up a little easier.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.344
But you're right,
I should have been more mature,

18:02.413 --> 18:04.946
but I guess I just got wrapped
up in myself.

18:05.373 --> 18:06.515
Yeah.

18:06.949 --> 18:10.252
Well, good, you should... work on that.

18:11.826 --> 18:14.327
Oh, my God!

18:14.429 --> 18:15.891
Dad had a moustache?

18:15.916 --> 18:16.782
Oh, yeah.

18:16.862 --> 18:19.198
You can let that one float away.

18:19.534 --> 18:21.834
Hey, listen, thanks for the help.

18:21.936 --> 18:23.569
You know, I was hoping that

18:23.638 --> 18:25.538
instead of forcing you down here,

18:25.607 --> 18:27.774
you would choose to come, and you did.

18:27.842 --> 18:29.887
Well, I think sometimes it's better

18:29.956 --> 18:31.963
if we just come to it
on our own, you know?

18:32.003 --> 18:33.336
Instead of all the yelling.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.972
Yeah, I guess I have
resorted to yelling a little.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.674
It's just that a lot of times

18:37.742 --> 18:39.843
things get so crazy and busy, and...

18:39.911 --> 18:40.977
and I just get frazzled.

18:41.046 --> 18:43.627
Well, it seems like... and this is just

18:43.695 --> 18:45.515
what I've observed over the years...

18:45.584 --> 18:48.504
but, you know, you say that
you're always busy

18:48.529 --> 18:50.963
and you don't have time
and you don't like

18:51.031 --> 18:53.861
how crazy everything is,
but maybe you do

18:53.963 --> 18:56.667
kind of like the drama
'cause all the craziness

18:56.769 --> 18:58.812
distracts you from feeling the feelings

18:58.881 --> 19:01.386
that you may not be
entirely comfortable with.

19:01.942 --> 19:03.409
Oh.

19:03.511 --> 19:04.919
Well, I...

19:04.944 --> 19:06.844
And I think if you just slowed down

19:06.946 --> 19:08.676
a little bit and took care of yourself,

19:08.690 --> 19:11.758
then things wouldn't have to
build up and burst all at once.

19:11.827 --> 19:14.084
It's kind of like these old rusty pipes.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.836
If you just took care
of things on a daily basis,

19:16.936 --> 19:18.735
then you wouldn't have to freak out

19:18.837 --> 19:21.271
when things feel like
they're flooding down on you.

19:21.373 --> 19:23.473
Well, thank you.

19:23.575 --> 19:25.409
That's a lot to chew on.

19:27.947 --> 19:29.846
Mom, are you crying?

19:29.915 --> 19:31.181
Maybe.

19:31.283 --> 19:33.383
Don't say anything to your dad.

19:42.252 --> 19:44.961
So did you figure out
a punishment for Axl?

19:45.013 --> 19:47.581
Uh, no. No.

19:47.858 --> 19:51.593
He had actually gone out
to grab everyone dinner.

19:51.661 --> 19:53.561
Okay, I have never

19:53.663 --> 19:55.700
used this word before to describe Axl,

19:55.802 --> 19:58.333
but that's very mature of him.

19:59.469 --> 20:04.239
Yeah. He seems to be getting
a little more mature and smart.

20:04.975 --> 20:07.442
Yeah, Sue's getting kind of smart, too.

20:07.544 --> 20:09.410
It's weird.

20:10.247 --> 20:11.674
It's like...

20:12.549 --> 20:15.950
...they've been
watching us their whole life,

20:16.052 --> 20:18.686
and now they know stuff about us.

20:18.789 --> 20:21.222
Did you remember to pick up
soap the other day?

20:21.324 --> 20:23.674
Uh, no, I forgot.

20:24.494 --> 20:25.760
I'm sorry.

20:27.097 --> 20:29.049
Did you just say, "I'm sorry"?

20:30.066 --> 20:32.534
Yeah. What's the big deal?

20:32.636 --> 20:34.936
You never say you're sorry.

20:35.038 --> 20:36.037
Okay.

20:36.139 --> 20:37.505
Don't make a big drama out of it.

20:37.574 --> 20:39.496
I'm not making a...

20:40.811 --> 20:42.477
You're right.

20:42.579 --> 20:44.112
I'm gonna work on that.

20:47.717 --> 20:48.716
You know, you think you need to

20:48.785 --> 20:50.685
role model for your kids,

20:50.787 --> 20:52.053
but the fact is

20:52.155 --> 20:53.955
whether you think
you're modeling or not,

20:54.057 --> 20:56.157
they are watching you.

20:56.226 --> 20:59.294
They've been watching you
the whole time.

20:59.396 --> 21:02.130
Okay, Axl and I threw out
everything that's ruined.

21:02.232 --> 21:04.215
All the rest of it
is just kind of ruined,

21:04.317 --> 21:06.568
so I'm guessing we're keeping it.

21:06.670 --> 21:09.103
How is it that my Lily Tomlin
"And That's the Truth" album

21:09.206 --> 21:12.240
gets wrecked and that box of old
answering machines is dry as a bone?

21:12.342 --> 21:13.608
I don't know.

21:19.549 --> 21:22.617
We may not be perfect,
but we did a few things right.

21:22.719 --> 21:24.786
I mean, I think we did.

21:24.888 --> 21:26.688
I don't know. I'll ask the kids.
