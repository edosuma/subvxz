01:55.658 --> 01:57.899
I want music. Bring the flute girl.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.900
Down with the gripes, domina.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.323
The lyre player, then.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.788
He died the last
Lupercalia, domina.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.249
l have been looking
for a replacement,

02:07.378 --> 02:09.664
but they are
very expensive at the moment.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.334
There's no music at all?

02:12.466 --> 02:15.003
Althea sings well.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.296
Does she?

02:18.472 --> 02:21.464
Althea, sing something.

02:22.601 --> 02:23.807
I don't...

02:23.936 --> 02:28.145
Don't mumble.
Do you know Crown Of Sappho?

02:30.609 --> 02:32.600
Yes, domina.

02:32.737 --> 02:35.069
Well, go on, then.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.665
Help me.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.174
Help me.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.885
Poison. It must have been.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.835
— You didn't.
— I did. I swear.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.549
One of father's litter bearers.

05:02.678 --> 05:05.636
It was beastly fun.
Penis like a horse.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.094
I don't want to wake mother.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.012
I don't know why you're so scared of her.

05:11.145 --> 05:13.852
— She seems harmless enough to me.
- You don't know her.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.017
What was that?

05:46.680 --> 05:48.090
No.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.431
Mother!

06:00.069 --> 06:02.060
— Octavia.
— Gods.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.811
What's her name again?

06:03.948 --> 06:05.609
Jooasta.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.025
She's a bad influence.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.072
Oh, I say.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.696
What are you doing?
Who is this?

06:13.832 --> 06:16.448
One of the servants
tried to poison me.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.077
What have you been doing to the servants
that they want to murder you?

06:20.214 --> 06:23.422
Nothing. This is Servilia's work.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.543
With Antony gone, she thinks
she can just do as she pleases.

06:26.679 --> 06:29.466
If you know it's her,
why are you torturing him?

06:29.598 --> 06:32.715
Because it isn't a legal confession
unless there's torture.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.432
You must take Servilia to court.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.144
No, I'm gonna kill her.

06:37.856 --> 06:41.269
If I get taken to court for it,
I can always claim it was self—defence.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.939
I'm thinking ahead, you see?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.904
This is wrong in so many ways
I don't know where to start.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.148
Well, what would you have me do?

06:50.202 --> 06:52.284
Who would protect us if I didn't?

06:52.413 --> 06:55.655
l...l'm... If you don't mind.

06:55.791 --> 06:58.658
No, don't go. I need you
as an independent witness.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.582
Take her away.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.752
Timon, is this gonna take all night?

07:06.427 --> 07:08.839
He's out again. Bring him round.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.257
Wait.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.989
Give me a name, boy.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.912
Give me a name
and I will spare your life.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.832
You want to live, don't you?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.376
Tell me, then. For your life.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.426
Servilia.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.758
Servilia.

07:56.602 --> 08:00.345
There, that wasn't so hard, was it?

08:12.326 --> 08:14.942
After you've killed him,

08:15.079 --> 08:17.365
dispose of the body discreetly.

08:34.390 --> 08:38.349
Forgive me. I did not know
that boy was corrupt.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.058
I will take my life if I must,

08:40.187 --> 08:43.725
but please know that I've been faithful.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.269
Damned blood.
lt'll stain my dress.

08:46.402 --> 08:50.065
l was misled
and I failed you miserably.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.062
Punish me as you see fit.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.861
It would serve you right to be gelded.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.494
As you wish, domina.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.737
And I would, you know,
if eunuchs were not so unfashionable.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.910
Let's just forget
about the whole thing.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.999
Thank you, domina. Thank you.

09:06.547 --> 09:09.038
Just get up, you silly man.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.881
Next time you want a boy,
buy one at the market.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.299
Any fool knows not to pick one up
from the streets.

09:17.433 --> 09:19.264
Thank you, domina.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.596
Go.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.058
And bring me
some bread and cheese.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.982
I'm absolutely starving.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.448
— What's your name, friend?
— I'm not your friend.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.610
A man's got a right to know
the name of his murderer.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.449
Timon.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.114
You're a Jew, ain't you?

09:39.246 --> 09:42.704
— That's not a Jew name.
— That's my name for business purposes.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.324
— Listen, Timon...
— Don't bother.

09:45.461 --> 09:48.043
Servilia, she's as rich
as your woman there.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.754
She'll pay you good money
if you spare me.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.291
Well, ldoubt it.
What good are you to her now?

09:54.428 --> 09:57.465
She's very fond of me.
She loves me, practically.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.338
She loves me.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.430
Well, I expect she'll get over it.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.597
Here we are.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.312
Please, I have money of my own.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.397
I'll pay you whatever.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.981
Please, don't kill me.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.229
Please, I beg you. I'm only 16.

11:08.836 --> 11:13.000
We done for tonight, boss?
I've got a woman waiting.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.379
Yes. We're done.

11:25.060 --> 11:26.971
See you later, then.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.334
Don't listen to your uncle. He's teasing.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.879
Close your mouth, please.
Put your mouth away, please.

12:00.012 --> 12:03.596
That was really, really nice.
Thank you so much.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.964
Lord, protect us.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.432
What has happened?

12:07.561 --> 12:09.768
Nothing. Business.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.600
Business? Can you not at least

12:12.733 --> 12:14.689
wash off your business
before returning home?

12:14.818 --> 12:16.604
Why? I'm not ashamed of it.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.022
Children, go and play outside.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.271
— Stay where you are.
- Brother...

12:20.407 --> 12:21.817
l'm their father, not you.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.067
You don't tell my children what to do.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.574
Go.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.286
Go!

12:32.419 --> 12:35.377
It's all right, babies.
Papa's just tired.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.930
What?

12:47.059 --> 12:48.469
Speak, then. Tell me.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.718
Look at yourself.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.641
Look at what you have become.
You are an animal.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.685
My righteous brother.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.274
Did he tell you of his righteous life
back in Judea?

12:58.403 --> 12:59.984
Did you tell her about that, brother?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.273
I've changed my ways.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.271
Thieving, gambling, chasing whores.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.568
— Stop it.
— It's the truth.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.487
Are you going to start
speaking the truth now?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.611
Because that I would find interesting!

13:10.290 --> 13:13.498
No? I didn't think so.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.164
She deserves better.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.007
Too bad for her, then.
This is what she's got.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.297
These treacheries you do
for that Roman witch,

13:25.430 --> 13:26.590
does she pay you enough?

13:26.723 --> 13:28.509
| get what I need.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.600
She must lavish you
with jewels and gold.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.104
What a rich man my brother is.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.687
Tell me, where do you hide
such fantastic wealth?

13:35.816 --> 13:37.852
We both sell what we have
to these people.

13:37.985 --> 13:41.523
All Rome's wealth is not enough to buy
what Hashem has given me.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.987
Again with Hashem.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.107
Let Hashem make me a living.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.859
The money that witch pays me
bought this fucking house,

13:48.996 --> 13:52.238
this fucking table,
and that fucking dress my wife wears!

13:52.374 --> 13:55.036
— That makes you proud?
— Proud as any free Roman.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.205
You breathe this fetid air of Rome,

13:58.338 --> 14:00.203
but you are not Roman.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.208
You walk her beshitted streets,
you speak her mongrel language,

14:04.344 --> 14:07.336
but you're not Roman.
You're a Jew.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.052
You may forget that, they never will.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.015
You speak so much
and know so little.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.178
Look at me.

14:16.314 --> 14:19.602
Do you hate your name so much
to invite this shame?

14:19.735 --> 14:21.600
Think of your family.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.272
Look at me!

14:23.405 --> 14:26.738
Try it, come on! Try it! Hit me!

14:26.867 --> 14:28.323
Hit me!

14:28.452 --> 14:31.319
That's it. Not so easy
to beat me any more, is it?

14:31.455 --> 14:33.366
I'm not your little brother any more.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.421
Yesh. Yesh!

14:48.513 --> 14:51.255
In the north, the great army

14:51.391 --> 14:55.225
under the leadership of
the generals Hirtius and Pansa

14:55.353 --> 14:58.095
assisted by Caesar Octavian

14:58.231 --> 15:01.644
is about to engage
with the forces of the traitor

15:01.777 --> 15:03.017
Mark Antony.

15:03.153 --> 15:06.691
All citizens are requested
to make offerings

15:06.823 --> 15:10.281
for the success
of our heroic soldiers.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.526
Long live the Republic!

16:19.980 --> 16:22.096
Get into line now!

16:47.966 --> 16:49.422
Vorenus.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.355
Titus Pullo?

17:20.916 --> 17:22.827
Who's that?

17:22.959 --> 17:24.745
Do you not know me, Pullo?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.377
Is that you, young master?

17:31.509 --> 17:32.760
It's fine.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.259
We're old friends.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.973
Octavian.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.558
They call me Caesar now, Pullo.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.485
All grown up.
Always knew you had it in you.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.784
You won, then?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.528
So it seems.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.243
How? I mean no offence.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.616
I can't take much credit.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.243
The legions under Hirtius
and Pansa did heroic work.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.122
The rest I owe to Agrippa.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.750
Anyroad, congratulations.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.969
Thank you.
What brings you here, Pullo?

18:18.098 --> 18:20.885
You didn't take part in the fighting either
from the look of you.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.133
Vorenus left Rome with Antony.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.762
I hoped to find him
before the battle started.

18:26.898 --> 18:28.980
I came to tell him
that his children are not dead.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.645
But now! must see
if he is dead himself.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.278
We must find him, then.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.395
I'll have my tribunes personally search
among the wounded.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.862
Thank you.
I can hardly expect...

18:35.991 --> 18:40.530
Nonsense. If you don't find him here,
you'd do well to comb the Cisalpine hills.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.278
Antony and his men
have skulked off there.

18:43.999 --> 18:44.988
Courier.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.926
Take the road north.

18:59.014 --> 19:01.972
Should anyone challenge
your passage

19:02.100 --> 19:04.682
you show them the seal of Caesar.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.722
Warn them of the consequences.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.688
You'll need fresh rations and a fast horse.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.352
Agrippa's men will see to it.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.690
Thank you, sir.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.203
The conquering heroes return.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.290
Another brilliant poem, Maecenas?

19:28.418 --> 19:30.204
Is there not something
useful you might do?

19:30.337 --> 19:34.046
Victory is not victory until it has a song.

19:34.174 --> 19:37.462
What news from the medics
on Hirtius and Pansa?

19:37.594 --> 19:39.710
Dead of their wounds,
I'm afraid, both of them.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.962
Poor souls.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.054
To die in the hour of their glory.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.173
Very sad.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.017
But convenient.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.057
The victory is now ours alone.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.805
Couldn't have worked out better, frankly.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.150
You really taught that old bully
a proper lesson.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.190
It was not a personal matter.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.564
It was necessary
for the good of the Republic.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.191
Of course. Of course.

20:03.328 --> 20:08.163
Agrippa, I've got letters I'm going to want you
to take on ahead to Rome.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.122
The first goes to my sister.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.536
Octavia?

20:13.880 --> 20:17.589
| only have the one sister, Agrippa.

20:17.717 --> 20:20.925
Make sure you put it
directly into her hand.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.670
My mother has a habit of stealing mail.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.049
The next goes to Cicero.

20:28.186 --> 20:31.895
Why send a general
to do a courier's work?

20:32.023 --> 20:35.186
That's all right. I am happy to go.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.435
I'm asking Cicero for a triumph.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.313
He'll know I'm serious
if Agrippa is there looking...

20:41.449 --> 20:43.064
grim and soldierly.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.537
| wish you would tell them
to do that further away.

20:49.666 --> 20:50.951
It gives me a fright every time.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.075
Your troops are gathering.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.582
Time to give them a speech.

20:57.799 --> 20:59.790
Right. Which speech do you think?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.258
The one about money.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.442
Gentlemen...

21:23.575 --> 21:25.531
we have done our work well.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.194
We have gained a victory
that will live on in history forever.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.242
We have saved the Republic

21:32.375 --> 21:34.661
from those who threatened her.

21:35.670 --> 21:38.002
Rome is now in our debt.

21:38.131 --> 21:43.922
And we are owed a great deal of money.

21:45.096 --> 21:47.712
So while Antony drags
the remnants of his men

21:47.849 --> 21:49.464
to the frozen north,

21:49.601 --> 21:53.970
I thought we might head south to Rome.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.730
What do you say?

21:57.859 --> 22:00.145
Is it time to tell
the Senate to pay up?

22:04.324 --> 22:07.566
Well, then, to Rome!

22:07.702 --> 22:12.162
— Mars! Mars!
— Exulte! Exulte!

22:22.342 --> 22:24.128
Vorenus?

22:25.136 --> 22:27.513
I'm looking for Prefect Vorenus.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.589
A bag of salt for any man
that helps me.

22:31.726 --> 22:33.637
Lucius Vorenus.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.931
I'm looking
for Lucius Vorenus.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.188
Vorenus?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.274
Vorenus?

22:47.951 --> 22:49.942
What are you doing here?

22:51.371 --> 22:53.157
Your children are alive.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.783
Take him over there, lads.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.456
Move it on up there.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.707
Eighth Cohort lost two full maniples.

23:05.843 --> 23:09.552
Ninth, almost wiped out. Tenth Cohort intact.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.922
The Fourth Legion's much worse, sir.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.764
They suffered
the full brunt of the attack.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.724
Yes, yes.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.935
How many dead in total?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.600
8,000 men, sir, give or take.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.347
8,000?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.975
Oh, do cheer up.
You're still alive, aren't you?

23:24.112 --> 23:28.446
I do hope so. If this is the afterlife,
it is extremely disappointing.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.993
Disband the Fourth Cohort

23:31.119 --> 23:34.156
and use the survivors
to reinforce the Third.

23:34.289 --> 23:35.950
We're heading north.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.415
I want to establish a base camp
in the mountain before the first snowfall.

23:39.544 --> 23:40.829
Yes, sir.

23:40.962 --> 23:44.750
And, Tribune,
don't look so damn grim.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.749
— Set an example.
- Yes, sir.

23:47.885 --> 23:51.093
- Sorry, sir.
— Off you go.

23:52.974 --> 23:54.430
What are you doing back there?

23:54.559 --> 23:57.551
You stitching me up or making a dress?
Will you hurry up, man?

23:57.687 --> 24:01.054
A base camp in the mountains,
is that wise?

24:01.190 --> 24:04.648
General Posca speaks.
Do you have a better idea?

24:04.777 --> 24:06.438
While we still have
the semblance of an army,

24:06.571 --> 24:08.482
I would've thought
we should offer terms.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.698
Terms? Of surrender?

24:11.826 --> 24:13.362
That's fucking slave talk.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.780
No, we will have no more of that.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.450
North to the mountains, then.
And after that?

24:20.293 --> 24:21.783
I'll think of something.

24:21.919 --> 24:24.501
God damn it, man!

24:24.631 --> 24:27.168
— General Antony, sir.
- Vorenus.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.042
Requesting permission
to leave the legion, sir.

24:30.178 --> 24:33.170
Now that is a real soldier for you.

24:33.306 --> 24:35.638
Most men just slip away
into the night.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.177
But this one,

24:37.310 --> 24:40.177
he asks permission
before he deserts me.

24:40.313 --> 24:41.803
Well, what is it?

24:41.939 --> 24:44.521
It's my children, sir.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.812
They're alive and in slavery.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.773
Good news, bad news.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.942
I must find them, sir.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.151
All right.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.196
The number of good men
I've lost today,

25:00.333 --> 25:02.540
one more isn't gonna
make any difference.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.660
Thank you, sir.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.294
One more thing, boys!

25:11.427 --> 25:15.921
Be sure to tell everyone you meet

25:16.057 --> 25:18.514
that Mark Antony is not defeated.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.725
He will return,

25:20.853 --> 25:24.971
and all those
that defied him shall pay!

25:25.108 --> 25:28.225
That fucking little brat Octavian

25:28.361 --> 25:30.352
shall be first!

25:31.364 --> 25:32.695
You hear me, boys?

25:33.658 --> 25:35.364
Will do, chief.

25:43.334 --> 25:45.290
Word from Patara.

25:45.420 --> 25:49.709
They've capitulated to our demands.
They send 16,000 talents.

25:49.841 --> 25:53.049
— How many troops?
- 7,000.

25:53.177 --> 25:54.428
And Lycia?

25:54.554 --> 25:57.387
No word as yet, but I imagine
they will follow suit.

25:57.515 --> 25:59.676
See that they do.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.097
We must be up to
eight legions now.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.097
Nine. 25,000 infantry,

26:07.233 --> 26:08.939
10,000 cavalry.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.104
Almost a match for Antony.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.528
It's good.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.440
It's very good.

26:17.577 --> 26:20.569
Well, you look magnificent.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.291
You should have your portrait done.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.042
No, no time for such vanity.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.162
It would please your mother.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.253
It would, wouldn't it?

26:38.556 --> 26:40.137
O holy and blessed lady,

26:40.266 --> 26:42.598
perpetual comfort of humankind,

26:42.727 --> 26:46.311
who by thy bounty and grace
nourishes the whole world,

26:46.439 --> 26:49.476
and bears a great compassion
to the troubles of the miserable

26:49.609 --> 26:50.940
as a loving mother would,

26:51.819 --> 26:53.775
you are she that is the natural mother

26:53.905 --> 26:55.691
of all things,

26:55.823 --> 26:59.190
the mistress and governess
of all the elements,

26:59.327 --> 27:02.694
first of the gods celestial,

27:02.830 --> 27:05.071
light of the goddesses.

27:06.417 --> 27:11.161
O holy and blessed lady,
perpetual comfort of humankind,

27:11.297 --> 27:14.664
who by thy bounty and grace
nourishes the whole world

27:14.801 --> 27:18.134
and bears a great compassion
to the troubles of the miserable

27:18.262 --> 27:20.002
as a loving mother would.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.720
O holy and blessed lady,

27:21.849 --> 27:24.716
perpetual comfort of humankind,

27:24.852 --> 27:27.559
who by thy bounty and grace
nourishes the whole world,

27:27.688 --> 27:31.101
and bears a great compassion
to the troubles of the miserable

27:31.234 --> 27:32.724
as a loving mother would,

27:32.860 --> 27:36.318
you are she who is
the natural mother to all things,

28:15.319 --> 28:17.856
You know why you're here, don't you?

28:21.951 --> 28:23.407
Atia.

28:24.036 --> 28:26.243
Your boy confessed everything.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.828
Are you too afraid to speak?

28:35.047 --> 28:37.379
You weren't so quiet
when l was in your power.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.794
You were very talkative then.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.632
"A slow and painful death."

28:45.057 --> 28:46.968
That's what you promised me.

28:47.101 --> 28:49.137
That's what you deserve.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.474
You think you're so fucking superior,
don't you?

28:52.607 --> 28:54.814
You have no idea what I think.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.934
No? Well, tell me.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.071
Tell me what you think.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.234
I think...

29:07.079 --> 29:10.697
you're a sad, lonely little creature.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.119
I think at this moment,

29:13.252 --> 29:16.244
you're more afraid than I am.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.130
I've never been happier in my life.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.249
Then why do you keep talking?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.420
Kill me.

29:27.642 --> 29:30.304
When you kiss my feet,

29:30.436 --> 29:32.927
beg for me to end your suffering,

29:34.899 --> 29:36.139
then I'll kill you.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.015
Do as you like.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.815
Timon.

29:45.660 --> 29:49.653
You think it's me you degrade now,

29:49.789 --> 29:51.450
but it's not.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.158
lt's you.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.330
As long as you live

29:57.463 --> 30:01.081
you will feel degraded
and defiled by this.

30:03.886 --> 30:04.875
You.

30:06.097 --> 30:07.712
Get on with it.

31:08.409 --> 31:09.990
Have you had enough?

31:22.089 --> 31:23.329
Have you had enough?

31:33.684 --> 31:35.220
Continue.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.639
What do you want me to do?

31:41.776 --> 31:42.982
I don't know.

31:43.110 --> 31:45.226
Do something. Cut off her face.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.608
Do it.

31:57.208 --> 32:00.075
Mother lsis protect me.
Mother lsis protect me.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.093
Get up!

32:16.060 --> 32:18.301
Get up! Get up!

32:18.437 --> 32:21.600
— What are you doing?
- Go!

32:21.732 --> 32:23.723
Go!

32:24.693 --> 32:27.025
I am not an animal!

32:28.823 --> 32:31.815
I am not a fucking animal!

33:57.286 --> 33:59.572
So, brother...

34:07.087 --> 34:10.750
It's getting cooler. Be dark soon.

34:13.010 --> 34:15.092
Good time to set up camp, maybe.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.678
You may camp if you want.
I'm not stopping.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.933
So you can still talk.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.765
Thought maybe you'd forgotten how.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.886
| talk when I need to.
There's nothing to say.

34:26.482 --> 34:28.393
Still angry with me, then?

34:28.525 --> 34:29.776
No.

34:29.902 --> 34:33.110
Yes, well, listen.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.658
I'll get to the nub of it.
About Niobe...

34:36.784 --> 34:38.069
What of her?

34:38.202 --> 34:42.070
What I said back in the collegium
about me and her,

34:42.206 --> 34:44.538
l never...we never.

34:44.667 --> 34:47.659
| only said it to make you angry.
That's all.

34:49.505 --> 34:52.463
That's the truth, and you know that.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.923
I know.

34:55.052 --> 34:56.667
Had to be said.

34:58.722 --> 35:01.259
Even if I wanted to —
which I didn't -

35:01.392 --> 35:02.928
she's not that type of woman.

35:03.060 --> 35:06.552
I know women,
and she's not that type.

35:06.689 --> 35:08.771
Yon cunt Evander took advantage.

35:09.858 --> 35:12.235
If it's any consolation,

35:12.361 --> 35:15.444
I gave him a right session
before I killed him.

35:15.572 --> 35:17.153
Screamed like a stuck pig.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.274
Good. Thank you.

35:31.922 --> 35:34.413
You ever seen one
of these slave camps?

35:36.510 --> 35:37.625
No.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.014
It's not pretty.

35:41.140 --> 35:44.428
They'll be different now,
the children.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.766
I know.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.509
I don't think you do, though.

35:47.646 --> 35:50.308
You can't unless you've been there.

35:54.361 --> 35:56.602
The things I saw...

36:05.080 --> 36:07.867
Anyroad, they'll be different.

36:08.876 --> 36:11.242
— You should be ready.
— I don't care what they're like.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.539
| just...

36:13.672 --> 36:15.048
want them back.

36:15.174 --> 36:17.335
All I'm saying is...

36:18.385 --> 36:19.841
best be gentle.

36:22.181 --> 36:24.012
|wi||.

36:28.062 --> 36:29.393
And the boy?

36:31.106 --> 36:32.482
Lucius?

36:35.861 --> 36:39.353
You're not thinking
of killing him, are you?

36:41.450 --> 36:43.065
Honour demands that he die.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.615
True. Fair enough.
Honour demands it.

36:51.418 --> 36:53.659
Most likely won't sit well
with the girls though,

36:53.796 --> 36:55.787
if you do kill him.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.675
You talk too much.

37:06.850 --> 37:08.226
We all have our faults.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.215
Octavian won?

37:50.352 --> 37:51.717
He has.

37:51.854 --> 37:55.893
Antony and the remains of his army
have retreated to the mountains.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.483
Are they both unharmed?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.647
Octavian is very well.

38:01.780 --> 38:05.193
Antony's alive, but we know
no more than that.

38:10.831 --> 38:13.618
Your brother will return with his army.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.206
He'll be here within the month.

38:15.335 --> 38:18.202
With his army? Why with his army?

38:20.549 --> 38:22.255
Politics.

38:27.139 --> 38:30.347
He wants you to know
that whatever happens in the future,

38:30.476 --> 38:32.012
he will always protect you.

38:32.144 --> 38:35.102
But you must accept
his protection and his advice.

38:38.650 --> 38:42.393
He will look after me
after I swear him my allegiance?

38:42.529 --> 38:45.396
I am not one of his soldiers.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.365
I'm sure he does not doubt you.

38:48.494 --> 38:51.952
I think he means you to convey
the same message to your mother.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.531
Better it comes from you.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.704
Yes. Probably so.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.499
Your brother means you only the best.

39:01.632 --> 39:04.374
If it were othenNise,
I would not deliver the message.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.842
l'd sooner die than cause you pain.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.518
I hope you live a long life, then.

39:22.152 --> 39:25.736
If I may, I am compelled to speak.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.149
Ever since I met you,
my soul has burned...

39:30.285 --> 39:33.698
So is my brother eating properly?

39:35.624 --> 39:38.991
He would starve himself
unless someone forces him to eat.

39:40.170 --> 39:42.331
Yes. Yes.

39:47.261 --> 39:50.003
Army food agrees with him.

39:50.138 --> 39:53.722
He's not stout exactly,
but, yes, eating properly.

39:56.395 --> 39:59.262
Sorry. Sorry about just now.

39:59.398 --> 40:02.435
I very expressly
did not mean to do that.

40:02.568 --> 40:05.935
l blurted it out anyhow.
I should've written a letter.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.734
Anyhow, sorry.

40:10.659 --> 40:13.025
There's no need to apologise.

40:13.161 --> 40:16.619
Any friend of my brother
is my brother also.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.454
I'm sure when I know you better

40:18.584 --> 40:20.120
we shall be good friends.

40:21.253 --> 40:23.414
That's most gracious of you.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.128
A horrid imposition on my part.

40:25.257 --> 40:27.498
Of course, you barely know me.
Ridiculous.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.092
Octavia, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.633
Marcus Agrippa,
what are you doing here?

40:33.765 --> 40:36.142
Mother...

40:36.268 --> 40:37.724
Octavian...

40:37.853 --> 40:39.639
No, it's all right. It's all right.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.763
He's unharmed. He won.

40:44.234 --> 40:46.225
Antony was defeated.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.360
He's fled north.

40:59.541 --> 41:02.658
This is wonderful news. Amazing.

41:02.794 --> 41:07.128
I had hopes, of course,
but I hardly expected this.

41:07.257 --> 41:08.758
Wonderful.

41:09.801 --> 41:11.132
What of Hirtius and Pansa?

41:11.261 --> 41:13.217
Dead in battle.

41:13.347 --> 41:15.713
Dead?

41:15.849 --> 41:17.635
That's unfortunate.

41:17.768 --> 41:21.511
Still, a great victory.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.512
Read on.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.402
His army?

41:33.408 --> 41:36.525
He's bringing his army to Rome? Why?

41:36.662 --> 41:38.618
He has no enemies in Rome.
Why bring his army?

41:38.747 --> 41:40.783
I am just a messenger.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.328
I'm sure when he arrives,
Caesar will be happy to tell you.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.496
Caesar, he calls himself.

41:45.629 --> 41:48.245
Another Caesar.

41:48.382 --> 41:49.497
Just what we need.

41:49.633 --> 41:53.091
He calls himself Caesar
because that is his name by right.

41:53.220 --> 41:55.711
Yes, yes, no doubt.

41:55.847 --> 41:59.840
Gods, I'm so tired of young men
and their ambitions.

42:01.728 --> 42:02.638
So tired.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.261
I assure you,

42:04.398 --> 42:06.639
he has only the interests
of the Republic at heart.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.936
I'm sure he believes that.

42:10.362 --> 42:14.355
I thought the same
when l was a young man.

42:16.326 --> 42:19.113
But it is all vanity, you know.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.535
All vanity.

42:51.570 --> 42:52.776
This is the place.

43:28.732 --> 43:30.723
Let me do the talking.

43:32.235 --> 43:33.850
Salve, friend.

43:35.739 --> 43:38.651
Can you point us in the direction
of the procurator's office?

43:38.784 --> 43:40.866
What do you wanna know him for?

43:40.994 --> 43:42.200
Business.

43:42.329 --> 43:44.570
Looking for some runaways.

43:44.706 --> 43:46.287
Slave catchers, are you?

43:46.416 --> 43:47.496
Something like that.

43:47.626 --> 43:50.993
Camp's closed to unauthorised visitors.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.744
That right?

43:53.924 --> 43:55.915
Good bounty on runaways.

43:56.051 --> 43:58.838
Be worth something to you,
I expect, letting you in.

43:58.970 --> 44:01.006
Listen to me, you little weasel...

44:01.139 --> 44:04.552
My friend's a thrifty one,
but we're all men of commerce.

44:09.523 --> 44:11.309
Which way is the boss man?

44:17.739 --> 44:21.823
Round the bend, straight on,
house with a red door.

44:29.918 --> 44:31.658
Oh, leave off!

44:31.795 --> 44:33.501
He's bloody dead!

44:33.630 --> 44:36.246
Uncouple 'em!

44:36.383 --> 44:38.339
Told you I should do the talking.

44:38.468 --> 44:40.379
Grunt scum.

44:40.512 --> 44:42.844
Your spit dries fast here, brother.

44:42.973 --> 44:44.964
Best to save it.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.888
Come on!

45:00.365 --> 45:02.105
You the man in charge?

45:02.242 --> 45:04.278
Buying or selling?

45:04.411 --> 45:05.901
Titus Pullo, Lucius Vorenus.

45:06.037 --> 45:09.279
Here to retrieve some runaways.
Heard they got sold to your camp.

45:09.416 --> 45:12.249
— Two girls.
— And a boy.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.083
Got papers for 'em?

45:14.212 --> 45:16.373
— Not with us.
- Bill of sale?

45:16.506 --> 45:18.212
No.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.639
Two soldiers out
for some young cunny, yes?

45:27.767 --> 45:29.598
Shut your fucking mouth.

45:29.728 --> 45:31.844
Hold. Hold.

45:38.737 --> 45:39.897
What's his problem?

45:40.030 --> 45:42.567
I didn't want to have
to go into this, but...

45:42.699 --> 45:44.485
these children
are the private property

45:44.618 --> 45:47.485
of Gaius Caesar Octavian himself.

45:47.621 --> 45:51.580
He likes to have them serve
morning biscuits in bed.

45:51.708 --> 45:54.575
Especially the boy. Got it now?

45:56.379 --> 45:58.756
Oh, that's ripe. Good story.

45:59.633 --> 46:01.999
You see this seal?

46:02.135 --> 46:06.048
His orders for us
to come find his slaves.

46:06.181 --> 46:07.717
What is it, an otter?

46:07.849 --> 46:10.932
It's a fucking sphinx.
Mark of Caesar.

46:12.771 --> 46:14.978
- Odd wax, this.
— Mud from Mutina.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.392
That's why my friend here
is in fighting kit.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.436
Straight from the battlefield.

46:19.569 --> 46:21.355
It's that urgent.

46:26.451 --> 46:27.987
Caesar.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.700
Caesar.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.320
The one who just beat Mark Antony.

46:32.457 --> 46:35.290
What do you think he'd make
of a little fellow like you who crosses him?

46:35.418 --> 46:37.670
Yes, that's all very well,

46:37.796 --> 46:40.162
but what if you are lying to me?

46:42.217 --> 46:44.799
Are you calling me a liar?

46:48.765 --> 46:50.426
Check the rolls.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.997
Daughter...

47:19.421 --> 47:20.831
it's me.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.630
It's your father.

48:23.318 --> 48:25.309
You're not slave catchers.

48:30.116 --> 48:32.402
Where is she?

48:32.535 --> 48:34.491
The other one.

48:37.540 --> 48:39.622
Where's my daughter?
