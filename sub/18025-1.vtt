00:13.132 --> 00:15.381
What ya doing over there?

00:15.382 --> 00:17.625
Gotta go.

00:18.965 --> 00:23.042
- How come?
- A job.

00:26.341 --> 00:28.589
Funny hours.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.964
Funny job.

00:31.590 --> 00:35.537
- Will I see you again?
- No.

00:37.007 --> 00:40.330
You weren't wearing
that earlier, were you?

00:41.257 --> 00:44.331
- I brought it.
- Thank God!

00:44.840 --> 00:47.333
You look like a creep.

00:54.090 --> 00:56.880
You have great hands.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.792
- How am I doing, Tommy?
- Two minutes, Jack.

03:05.548 --> 03:07.589
You're giving me an ulcer, Jack.

03:07.590 --> 03:09.870
I am early.

03:10.507 --> 03:13.339
45 seconds does not
qualify as early, Jack.

03:13.340 --> 03:16.464
- Who does your tuxedo these days?
- Moon.

03:16.465 --> 03:20.168
Well, go to China Boy.
Look like you crawled out of bed.

03:20.965 --> 03:25.047
"Be the envy of your friends
with Miracle Hair"?

03:25.799 --> 03:27.339
This is paint, Frank.

03:27.340 --> 03:32.381
No, it's a magical sheath that
simulates a dazzling head of hair.

03:32.674 --> 03:36.422
- Frank, this is paint!
- Just help me put it on.

03:36.423 --> 03:39.497
You're supposed to spray
in a circular motion.

03:56.216 --> 03:58.215
Thank you.

03:58.216 --> 04:01.215
Good evening and welcome
to the Starfire Lounge.

04:01.216 --> 04:04.171
My name is Frank Baker.

04:04.257 --> 04:06.839
88 keys across from me is
my little brother, Jack.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.171
My brother and I have been playing
together for how long, Jack?

04:11.174 --> 04:12.756
31 years.

04:12.757 --> 04:15.997
That's a lot of water under
the bridge, huh, Jack?

04:16.216 --> 04:17.798
A lot of water.

04:17.798 --> 04:21.589
Things were different then.
I was 11, Jack was 7.

04:21.589 --> 04:25.458
The only one who'd listen to
us was the family cat, Cecil.

04:26.465 --> 04:30.665
We must have shaved 3 lives
off that cat, huh, Jack?

04:32.465 --> 04:35.381
But seriously, it's been
15 years since Jack and I

04:35.382 --> 04:37.881
stepped on stage as professionals.

04:37.882 --> 04:41.297
But though we've played some of
the finest venues in the world,

04:41.298 --> 04:46.339
there's always been a very
special place for us.

04:47.257 --> 04:51.339
That place is this place.
The Starfire Lounge.

04:51.340 --> 04:53.381
Why?

04:53.382 --> 04:56.506
I guess you could just say...

04:56.507 --> 04:58.704
the people.

05:22.507 --> 05:26.965
Terrific, boys, terrific.
Yes, sir!

05:26.966 --> 05:30.006
You're just what we needed
on a night like this.

05:30.007 --> 05:31.548
Thanks, Lloyd.

05:31.549 --> 05:34.131
Only Jack, do me a favor?

05:34.132 --> 05:37.090
If you want to smoke on stage,
put on a pair of sunglasses

05:37.091 --> 05:40.294
and go play with the
niggers on State Street.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.840
Here you go, fellas.
Ought to buy you more lessons.

05:45.841 --> 05:48.548
Do you know when you'd
want us to come back?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.746
I'll call you.

05:51.382 --> 05:53.881
I thought, the way our schedule is,

05:53.882 --> 05:56.589
it might be a good idea...

05:56.590 --> 05:58.870
I'll call you.

06:00.924 --> 06:03.214
Count it. Count it!

06:03.215 --> 06:04.464
Jack!

06:04.465 --> 06:07.372
Count the fucking money, Frank.

06:08.257 --> 06:10.666
It's all here.

06:13.091 --> 06:15.500
I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.

06:16.423 --> 06:18.172
Very nice, Jack. Very nice.

06:18.173 --> 06:19.756
Fuck him.

06:19.757 --> 06:23.256
This isn't the Pine
Tree Inn on Route 81.

06:23.257 --> 06:26.828
- Fuck him.
- Terrific. Fuck him.

06:28.799 --> 06:31.588
- Are we on for tomorrow night?
- Maybe Thursday.

06:32.966 --> 06:36.833
I hear the harpist at the
Sheraton has appendicitis.

06:41.007 --> 06:43.120
Hey!

06:43.632 --> 06:46.255
Don't forget your hair.

07:01.549 --> 07:05.297
I think I'm ready for "Oh
What Fun it is to Ride".

07:07.424 --> 07:10.165
Your mom got a new friend?

07:12.215 --> 07:13.798
Uh-huh.

07:13.799 --> 07:15.673
Sounds big. What's he do?

07:15.674 --> 07:20.131
Kind of like a lawyer, but
the hours are more regular.

07:20.132 --> 07:24.048
All I know is, one day he
came to take the TV away,

07:24.049 --> 07:26.214
and ended up staying for dinner.

07:26.215 --> 07:28.965
What happened to the Donut King?

07:28.966 --> 07:31.162
Married.

07:33.841 --> 07:36.715
No breakfast.
Maybe they had a fight.

07:36.716 --> 07:38.631
Nina!

07:38.632 --> 07:41.208
Gotta go. Teach me later?

07:44.882 --> 07:46.214
I'm coming!

07:46.215 --> 07:48.673
Are you bothering Mr. Baker again?

07:48.674 --> 07:50.871
No, Mom.

07:51.507 --> 07:52.881
Hey!

07:52.882 --> 07:54.913
Get up.

08:36.506 --> 08:38.881
Thank you Mahalu.
That concludes this evening's show.

08:38.881 --> 08:42.423
Jack and I hope you enjoyed
yourselves as much as we did.

08:42.424 --> 08:44.454
And...

08:48.841 --> 08:51.962
which means "Paddle home safely."

08:58.590 --> 09:00.506
You want to see me, Charlie.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.414
Frankie! Yeah, come on in.

09:04.549 --> 09:07.131
- Little slow tonight.
- Mondays.

09:07.132 --> 09:10.256
- How is Jack?
- Okay.

09:10.257 --> 09:13.294
I wanted to see you
alone because...

09:13.882 --> 09:17.256
The kitchen help, maids, they
love him. He makes me nervous.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.129
Sometimes he makes me nervous.

09:20.590 --> 09:22.918
Well, anyway...

09:24.924 --> 09:27.666
- What is this?
- Your pay.

09:29.382 --> 09:31.006
What about tomorrow night?

09:31.007 --> 09:33.172
It's all there. Both nights.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.548
What are you saying, Charlie?

09:37.215 --> 09:40.339
You and Jack have been
working here a long time.

09:40.340 --> 09:41.964
12 years.

09:41.965 --> 09:45.506
Maybe it's time we took a
vacation from one another.

09:45.507 --> 09:47.089
Vacation?

09:47.090 --> 09:50.214
Come on, it's Monday night!
You said so yourself.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.590
I got the pianos for two nights.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.756
It wasn't even half
full out there tonight.

09:54.757 --> 09:57.798
I have six waiters in the
back listening to basketball.

09:57.799 --> 09:59.339
I gotta move the liquor.

09:59.340 --> 10:03.623
So, I have to fill the tables.
It's a matter of economics.

10:04.299 --> 10:08.631
I love you guys.
You're class.

10:08.632 --> 10:10.423
But people today...

10:10.424 --> 10:12.047
they don't know class

10:12.048 --> 10:16.165
if it walks up and grabs
them by the balls.

10:28.923 --> 10:31.798
15 years, no one's paid us off.

10:31.799 --> 10:35.121
He made the deal.
There's no shame in it.

10:38.173 --> 10:40.172
We gotta talk.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.204
Talk!

10:42.757 --> 10:46.162
I've been thinking maybe we
should make some changes.

10:47.215 --> 10:50.455
Maybe we should take on a singer.

10:53.257 --> 10:56.294
It's just an idea.
I want your opinion.

10:58.007 --> 11:00.089
We go half on everything, right?

11:00.090 --> 11:02.590
I wouldn't say exactly
half, would you?

11:02.591 --> 11:05.673
We agreed it I did the business,
I'd be entitled to a little extra.

11:05.674 --> 11:09.006
- Is that what we agreed?
- Yeah, that's what we agreed.

11:09.007 --> 11:10.256
If you're unhappy...

11:10.257 --> 11:12.131
- I'm not unhappy.
- If you want to...

11:12.132 --> 11:14.715
assume more of the financial
responsibility, I'd be glad.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.506
How much for the singer?

11:16.507 --> 11:21.335
20%. With additional bookings,
we'll come out ahead.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.912
What?

11:26.299 --> 11:29.381
Two pianos isn't enough anymore.

11:29.382 --> 11:31.626
Never was.

11:33.424 --> 11:35.548
I appreciate your
punctuality, Miss...

11:35.549 --> 11:38.006
Moran.
Monica Moran.

11:38.007 --> 11:39.631
Alright, Miss Moran.

11:39.632 --> 11:42.214
Actually, that's my stage name.

11:42.215 --> 11:44.839
- I'm sorry.
- Monica Moran.

11:44.840 --> 11:49.548
That's my stage name.
My real name is Blanche.

11:49.549 --> 11:51.173
Blanche?

11:51.174 --> 11:53.006
No romance, right?

11:53.007 --> 11:56.465
That's why I came up with Monica.
It's what I prefer.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.839
Well, that's alright.

11:59.007 --> 12:02.173
But if you call my house
and my mother answers,

12:02.174 --> 12:03.673
ask for Blanche.

12:03.674 --> 12:08.288
If not, she'll think you have
the wrong number and hang up.

12:11.340 --> 12:14.911
Yes, well. What is it
you'd like to do for us?

12:15.549 --> 12:19.006
"The Candy Man".
Is that all right?

12:19.007 --> 12:21.464
That's one of Jack's favorites.

12:23.215 --> 12:26.339
I almost forgot you were there.

12:26.340 --> 12:29.331
Here's the instructions.

12:29.591 --> 12:31.089
He knows it.

12:31.090 --> 12:35.539
Really?
Isn't that a coincidence?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.119
Small world.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.037
Shall we?

12:54.743 --> 12:58.614
<i>Who can take a sunrise</i>

12:58.615 --> 13:02.115
<i>Sprinkle it with dew</i>

13:02.116 --> 13:05.748
<i>Cover it in chocolate
and a miracle or two</i>

13:05.749 --> 13:09.748
<i>The candy man can</i>

13:09.749 --> 13:13.448
<i>The candy man can</i>

13:13.449 --> 13:17.231
<i>- The candy man can 'cause he...</i>
- Thank you, that's enough.

13:17.249 --> 13:19.673
<i>- ...Makes the world taste good</i>
- Miss Moran!

13:19.674 --> 13:23.814
- Miss Moran!
<i>- Who can take a rainbow...</i>

13:23.815 --> 13:27.444
Miss Moran! Blanche!

13:28.757 --> 13:30.089
Sorry.

13:30.090 --> 13:33.548
I get so caught up in it sometimes.

13:33.549 --> 13:35.381
It's scary.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.662
Yes, it is.

13:38.923 --> 13:42.080
Well, okay. Thank you.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.214
<i>And now the end is near</i>

13:47.215 --> 13:49.214
<i>And so I face the final curtain</i>

13:49.215 --> 13:50.598
<i>My friends, I'll make it clear</i>

13:50.599 --> 13:52.298
<i>I'll state my case...</i>

13:54.098 --> 13:56.298
<i>Up, up and away</i>

13:56.599 --> 13:59.464
<i>In my beautiful balloon</i>

13:59.465 --> 14:01.964
<i>Would you like to fly</i>

14:01.965 --> 14:05.048
<i>In my beautiful balloon...</i>

14:05.349 --> 14:08.847
<i>Well, tiny bubbles...</i>

14:08.848 --> 14:10.847
<i>When my baby smiles at me</i>

14:10.848 --> 14:12.847
<i>I go to Rio...</i>

14:12.848 --> 14:15.348
<i>Feelings...</i>

14:15.349 --> 14:17.847
<i>I want to love you</i>

14:17.848 --> 14:18.847
<i>Feel you</i>

14:18.848 --> 14:21.048
<i>Wrap myself around you</i>

14:21.349 --> 14:22.348
<i>I'm so excited</i>

14:22.349 --> 14:24.048
<i>Just about to lose control</i>

14:24.149 --> 14:25.348
<i>I'm about to lose control</i>

14:25.349 --> 14:27.549
<i>And I think I like it</i>

14:27.848 --> 14:28.847
<i>I like it</i>

14:28.848 --> 14:29.847
<i>I like it</i>

14:29.848 --> 14:31.048
<i>I love it</i>

14:31.349 --> 14:34.332
<i>Aaaahh</i>

14:36.341 --> 14:40.374
37 girls and not one
who can carry a tune.

14:42.257 --> 14:46.208
There was a certain
surreal quality to it.

14:47.424 --> 14:49.548
God damn it!

14:49.549 --> 14:51.548
Shit!

14:51.549 --> 14:53.958
Shoe.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.839
Is this where the auditions are?

15:00.840 --> 15:04.755
Where the auditions were.
We're finished.

15:05.007 --> 15:06.714
What about me?

15:06.715 --> 15:08.839
You're an hour and a half late.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.755
I had trouble catching a cab.

15:14.466 --> 15:18.923
Punctuality, first
rule of show business.

15:18.924 --> 15:21.500
This is show business?

15:22.798 --> 15:25.340
Look Miss, we're tired,

15:25.341 --> 15:28.829
you have gum on your lip
and we're going home.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.548
Just like that, huh?

15:32.549 --> 15:35.381
I come down here, break a heel

15:35.382 --> 15:39.631
and you won't give me a chance
because I'm a little late!

15:39.632 --> 15:43.589
An hour an a half late.
Want me to say it again?

15:43.590 --> 15:46.664
Well, it's not exactly
bewitching me.

15:47.673 --> 15:50.628
Besides, you're not going anywhere.

15:51.090 --> 15:52.756
I beg your pardon?

15:52.757 --> 15:56.298
Intuition. I had a hunch
about this all day.

15:56.299 --> 15:59.834
Only, in my mind, it was
a little more glamorous.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.997
So, where's the winner?

16:15.548 --> 16:19.037
See? Intuition.

16:19.382 --> 16:21.413
Jack...

16:24.965 --> 16:27.458
What have we got to lose?

16:29.715 --> 16:31.589
Terrific.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.752
38!

16:35.090 --> 16:39.088
What is that, "38"?
Do you guys have a code?

16:42.299 --> 16:44.577
Name?

16:44.798 --> 16:47.089
Susie Diamond.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.839
Catchy.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.881
Do you have any previous
experience as a singer?

16:51.882 --> 16:53.912
No.

16:54.382 --> 16:57.621
Any entertainment experience?

16:57.965 --> 17:02.829
Last couple of years I've been on
call for Triple A Escort Service.

17:09.299 --> 17:12.916
What would you like to share?

17:13.757 --> 17:16.250
"More Than You Know".

17:21.174 --> 17:23.500
Slow, okay?

17:32.882 --> 17:36.582
<i>More than you know</i>

17:37.882 --> 17:42.381
<i>More than you know</i>

17:42.382 --> 17:46.381
<i>Man of my heart</i>

17:46.382 --> 17:49.582
<i>I love you so</i>

17:51.382 --> 17:54.082
<i>Lately I find</i>

17:55.382 --> 17:58.082
<i>You're on my mind</i>

17:59.882 --> 18:02.582
<i>More than you know</i>

18:07.882 --> 18:12.582
<i>Whether you're right</i>

18:12.882 --> 18:15.582
<i>Whether you're wrong</i>

18:16.882 --> 18:20.582
<i>Man of my heart</i>

18:20.882 --> 18:24.582
<i>I'll string along</i>

18:25.382 --> 18:28.881
<i>You need me so</i>

18:28.882 --> 18:37.582
<i>More than you'll ever</i>

18:37.882 --> 18:45.582
<i>Know</i>

18:53.715 --> 18:55.745
So?

19:00.965 --> 19:04.173
Did I not tell everyone: 7.15?

19:04.174 --> 19:07.506
- She'll get here.
- Like the day of the auditions.

19:07.507 --> 19:09.585
Jesus!

19:12.465 --> 19:14.340
How is my hair?

19:14.341 --> 19:16.340
Awe inspiring.

19:16.341 --> 19:18.881
Well, yours is not.
Let me run a comb through it.

19:18.882 --> 19:20.589
- Get out of here.
- Come on, stand still.

19:20.590 --> 19:22.547
It won't hurt you.
Hold on.

19:22.548 --> 19:26.381
I'll hit you, I swear.

19:29.715 --> 19:32.673
- You hit me.
- I told you I was.

19:32.674 --> 19:35.298
I am a little wound up.

19:35.299 --> 19:38.589
- You're a fucking alarm clock.
- I just wish she'd get here.

19:38.590 --> 19:40.787
She's here.

19:42.965 --> 19:45.707
Christ. Look at her.

19:47.757 --> 19:50.794
Good evening, Miss Diamond.
You're late.

19:51.340 --> 19:54.756
Guest vocalist? Who's
next week, Beverly Sills?

19:54.757 --> 19:57.256
How come you guys have
your picture on the poster?

19:57.257 --> 20:00.048
We'll talk later. Your dress?

20:00.049 --> 20:01.339
What are you talking about?

20:01.340 --> 20:04.839
Is there a language problem?
Where's your dress for tonight?

20:04.840 --> 20:07.120
Do I look like I'm naked?

20:07.132 --> 20:08.798
With that?

20:08.799 --> 20:10.048
What are you, insane?

20:10.049 --> 20:12.923
Are you going trick or treating?

20:12.924 --> 20:15.756
- He doesn't like my dress, right?
- We don't have much time.

20:15.757 --> 20:19.671
What are you doing?
Don't grab me. Don't!

20:23.632 --> 20:26.373
- What are you, an eight?
- A six.

20:30.799 --> 20:33.208
How about this?

20:35.091 --> 20:37.369
Here. How is this?

20:55.548 --> 20:58.131
We'll take them from your share.

20:58.132 --> 20:59.839
You are a prince.

20:59.840 --> 21:04.048
Jack, touch me up, will you?
Remember, Jack and I are on first.

21:04.049 --> 21:06.838
I do the set-up and introduce you.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.215
And you say?

21:08.216 --> 21:11.381
Good evening ladies and gentlemen,
I can't tell you... what is that?

21:11.382 --> 21:13.173
Winding your watch these days?

21:13.174 --> 21:15.714
- A little emergency, Ray.
- "Miracle Hair".

21:15.715 --> 21:18.422
- Who is this, Minnie Pearl?
- We need some scissors.

21:18.423 --> 21:21.589
I want 75 minutes, Frankie.

21:21.590 --> 21:25.090
Don't worry, they'll cut
this off. Scissors!

21:25.091 --> 21:27.256
Fix your tie.

21:27.257 --> 21:29.506
Good luck, guys.
It's a pretty ugly group.

21:29.507 --> 21:31.798
They send back the cheese balls.

21:31.799 --> 21:34.043
No scissors.

21:43.257 --> 21:44.548
Good evening.

21:44.549 --> 21:47.173
Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge.

21:47.174 --> 21:49.464
My name's Frank Baker.

21:49.465 --> 21:53.380
And no, you're not seeing double.
It's just my brother, Jack.

22:00.507 --> 22:04.505
- Just a sip. For the butterflies.
- Okay, but no lipstick.

22:04.715 --> 22:06.714
What's that on your wrist?

22:06.715 --> 22:08.422
The next hour and a
half of my life.

22:08.423 --> 22:10.589
<i>... a very special place.</i>

22:10.590 --> 22:13.756
And that place is this place,

22:13.757 --> 22:15.714
the Ambassador Lounge.

22:15.715 --> 22:19.090
Please give a warm welcome
to a very special lady

22:19.091 --> 22:21.297
with a very special way
of singing a song.

22:21.298 --> 22:24.089
Miss Susie Diamond!

22:31.423 --> 22:33.506
Ladies and Gentlemen...

22:33.507 --> 22:37.209
- Hit the switch.
- Switch?

22:37.632 --> 22:40.255
What fucking switch?

22:42.465 --> 22:44.745
Pardon me.

22:46.132 --> 22:50.130
I can't tell you how
thrilled I am to be here.

23:01.549 --> 23:04.373
<i>I work at the Palace Ballroom</i>

23:04.381 --> 23:07.881
<i>But, gee, that palace is cheap</i>

23:07.882 --> 23:09.380
<i>When I get home</i>

23:09.381 --> 23:11.881
<i>To my chilly hall room</i>

23:11.882 --> 23:16.581
<i>I'm much too tired to sleep</i>

23:22.882 --> 23:27.380
<i>I'm one of those lady teachers</i>

23:27.381 --> 23:31.082
<i>A beautiful hostess, you know</i>

23:31.882 --> 23:36.131
<i>One that the palace features</i>

23:36.132 --> 23:39.881
<i>At exactly a dime</i>

23:39.882 --> 23:42.082
<i>A throw</i>

23:46.507 --> 23:49.506
<i>Ten cents a dance,</i>

23:49.631 --> 23:52.630
<i>That's what they pay me</i>

23:52.924 --> 23:57.123
<i>Gosh, how they weigh me down.</i>

23:59.132 --> 24:02.131
<i>Ten cents a dance</i>

24:02.132 --> 24:05.332
<i>Pansies and rough guys</i>

24:05.631 --> 24:10.831
<i>Tough guys who tear my gown</i>

24:12.631 --> 24:17.831
<i>Seven to midnight I hear drums</i>

24:18.631 --> 24:24.332
<i>Loudly the saxophone blows</i>

24:24.631 --> 24:31.131
<i>Trumpets are tearing my eardrums</i>

24:31.132 --> 24:36.082
<i>Customers crush my toes</i>

24:37.381 --> 24:40.380
<i>Sometimes I think</i>

24:40.381 --> 24:44.380
<i>I've found my hero</i>

24:44.381 --> 24:49.082
<i>But it's a queer romance</i>

24:50.882 --> 24:55.581
<i>All that you need is a ticket</i>

24:56.882 --> 25:00.881
<i>Come on, big boy</i>

25:00.882 --> 25:07.581
<i>Ten cents a dance</i>

25:17.549 --> 25:20.631
She says "fucking" in front
of an entire room of people.

25:20.632 --> 25:22.715
- I apologized.
- Did you hear it?

25:22.716 --> 25:24.089
Fucking.

25:24.090 --> 25:26.798
They were on their third Mai Tai
by the time I got out there.

25:26.799 --> 25:27.715
Fucking.

25:27.716 --> 25:31.334
For Christ's sake,
I said it, I didn't do it.

25:31.632 --> 25:34.047
I don't think they were
that offended, do you?

25:34.048 --> 25:38.663
We don't take tips
from dirty old men.

25:39.173 --> 25:41.214
I was going to split it!

25:41.215 --> 25:45.248
We do not take tips.
This goes to cost of the dress.

25:46.299 --> 25:49.631
Then I want my picture and
my name on the poster.

25:49.632 --> 25:53.167
And these shoes are
too fucking tight!

26:02.299 --> 26:04.496
Nice girl.

26:05.015 --> 26:08.014
<i>I love you, baby</i>

26:08.015 --> 26:10.014
<i>And if it's quite all right</i>

26:10.015 --> 26:12.014
<i>I need you, baby</i>

26:12.015 --> 26:14.215
<i>To warm the lonely nights</i>

26:14.514 --> 26:17.014
<i>I love you, baby</i>

26:17.015 --> 26:21.630
<i>Trust in me when I say</i>

26:21.631 --> 26:24.130
<i>I love you, baby</i>

26:24.131 --> 26:26.130
<i>And if it's quite all right</i>

26:26.131 --> 26:28.130
<i>I need you, baby</i>

26:28.131 --> 26:30.130
<i>To warm the lonely nights</i>

26:30.131 --> 26:32.831
<i>I love you, baby</i>

26:33.131 --> 26:37.630
<i>Trust in me when I say</i>

26:37.631 --> 26:40.130
<i>Oh, pretty baby</i>

26:40.131 --> 26:42.130
<i>Don't bring me down, I pray</i>

26:42.131 --> 26:44.130
<i>Oh, pretty baby</i>

26:44.131 --> 26:46.130
<i>Now that I found you, stay</i>

26:46.131 --> 26:49.831
<i>And let me love you, baby</i>

26:50.131 --> 26:54.831
<i>Let me love you</i>

26:55.131 --> 26:57.831
<i>Love you, baby</i>

26:58.131 --> 27:01.331
<i>Let me love</i>

27:01.631 --> 27:06.331
<i>You</i>

27:09.591 --> 27:11.006
<i>Where did you find her anyway?</i>

27:11.007 --> 27:13.006
The girl.

27:13.007 --> 27:16.496
She was a kid who hung around.
We gave her a break.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.881
Give her a tip from me, will ya?

27:18.882 --> 27:22.453
Smaller dress means a bigger crowd.

27:22.591 --> 27:26.257
Here you go, guys.
Don't spend it all in one place.

27:28.007 --> 27:29.631
Jack...

27:29.632 --> 27:32.089
maybe you want to count it.

27:33.382 --> 27:36.456
You know we trust you, Lloyd.

27:38.340 --> 27:39.964
Frankie, while you're here,

27:39.965 --> 27:42.079
how is next week for you guys?

27:44.299 --> 27:46.496
We'll call you.

27:52.340 --> 27:55.298
Did you see his face?
Did you see it?

27:55.299 --> 27:56.922
The world is good.

27:56.923 --> 28:00.756
Don't let anybody tell
you any different.

28:09.340 --> 28:11.715
Good night, Baker.

28:29.048 --> 28:30.881
How ya doing, Henry?

28:30.882 --> 28:33.209
Can't complain.

28:33.591 --> 28:36.047
What do you think of the kid?

28:41.174 --> 28:44.089
When does his mother pick him up?

28:44.090 --> 28:46.214
He's been playing here for a year.

28:46.215 --> 28:49.005
You ought to come around
more often, Jack.

28:53.674 --> 28:56.256
So how about Jack Baker?

28:56.257 --> 28:59.248
Still stomping at the Sheraton?

29:00.716 --> 29:03.291
Keeps me out of trouble.

29:04.132 --> 29:06.673
Then what are you doing here?

29:07.090 --> 29:09.465
Looking for trouble.

29:26.340 --> 29:29.627
Try to control your excitement, Ed.

29:33.923 --> 29:36.298
Let me see your teeth.

29:39.632 --> 29:41.381
<i>Yeah, they gotta to go.</i>

29:41.382 --> 29:46.246
5 is my guess, maybe more.
Don't know till I get in there.

29:46.591 --> 29:47.964
And bones?

29:47.965 --> 29:50.381
Those days are over, I'm afraid.

29:50.382 --> 29:53.756
Don't worry, we'll knock him out.
He won't feel a thing.

29:53.757 --> 29:55.835
Excuse me.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.339
Should have brushed, pal.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.256
Bernie at the Hilton said

30:03.257 --> 30:06.548
the nights we play,
she's triples her tips.

30:06.549 --> 30:10.714
That's because there's Chivas.
And pearls, not polyester.

30:10.715 --> 30:11.922
I don't understand.

30:11.923 --> 30:15.506
- You're saying we should...
- Ask for a percentage of the bar.

30:15.507 --> 30:18.089
Mel Torme doesn't get
a percentage of the bar.

30:18.090 --> 30:20.667
Maybe he never asked.

30:22.840 --> 30:24.714
Are you hearing this?

30:24.715 --> 30:26.797
How much is she drawing?

30:26.798 --> 30:29.256
Well, two months ago she
was wearing a Timex,

30:29.257 --> 30:33.381
and now a Seiko.
The Hilton didn't put it there.

30:33.382 --> 30:36.173
You're not actually
listening to this, are you?

30:36.174 --> 30:39.672
- Jerry Stein books the Hilton?
- For 8 years!

30:39.673 --> 30:42.797
Forget about the bar.
We'd look like amateurs.

30:42.798 --> 30:45.590
But why not bump them for
an extra 100 up front?

30:45.591 --> 30:47.590
I don't like it.

30:47.591 --> 30:50.249
It's not how we play the game.

30:52.049 --> 30:54.956
The game is changing.

31:16.798 --> 31:20.631
No, thanks. I never touch
American cigarettes.

31:20.632 --> 31:24.299
3.50 a pack and I go through them!

31:25.549 --> 31:27.839
Paris Opals.

31:27.840 --> 31:30.417
3.50 a pack.

31:31.341 --> 31:33.131
Know how much that is a piece?

31:33.132 --> 31:34.631
17 cents.

31:34.632 --> 31:36.006
17 and a half.

31:36.007 --> 31:37.881
I figured it out once.

31:37.882 --> 31:42.462
If you stick it in your mouth,
it might as well be the best.

31:45.757 --> 31:48.084
Merry Christmas!

31:50.007 --> 31:52.085
What do you think?

31:54.174 --> 31:57.548
It's me. I thought I'd
give the kids a thrill.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.964
Be bright and early Monday.
We got a long drive.

32:00.965 --> 32:03.209
Merry, merry.

32:04.424 --> 32:05.839
I don't know.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.131
It's hard figuring you
and Egghead as brothers.

32:08.132 --> 32:11.585
The hospital might have
scrambled the babies.

32:13.507 --> 32:15.881
This is a last soul.

32:26.132 --> 32:29.039
Well, <i>au revoir.</i>

32:30.548 --> 32:32.923
Like a cup of coffee?

32:34.174 --> 32:36.666
Now? On Christmas Eve?

32:38.965 --> 32:41.923
No. It gives me the shakes.

32:41.924 --> 32:45.377
I better go home, rest the pipes.

32:46.757 --> 32:48.787
Want me to walk you?

32:52.299 --> 32:55.420
No... thanks.

32:58.548 --> 33:02.381
Listen, you're not going
soft on me, are you?

33:02.424 --> 33:05.256
You won't start dreaming about
me and waking up all sweaty,

33:05.257 --> 33:08.745
and look at me like a
princess when I burp?

33:09.466 --> 33:11.215
Forget it.

33:11.216 --> 33:14.455
It would be too creepy,
with us working together.

33:14.798 --> 33:18.085
Hurry. You're a nickel
down on your cigarette.

33:27.507 --> 33:30.083
Super Chief around the corner.

33:31.715 --> 33:35.169
Bathroom. Super Chief.
Around the corner.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.465
No, I left my dog
here this morning.

33:38.466 --> 33:40.298
Regular hours are 8 to 5.

33:40.299 --> 33:44.381
I know. I was passing and thought
I'd drop by and see him.

33:44.382 --> 33:47.465
You can check on him,
tomorrow between 8 and 5.

33:47.466 --> 33:49.672
I thought I could just...

33:49.673 --> 33:53.624
We are not communicating
here, are we?

33:57.382 --> 34:00.340
You want to know
if he's okay, right?

34:00.341 --> 34:02.371
Yeah.

34:02.424 --> 34:05.672
- Alright. Hold on.
- The name is Baker.

34:05.673 --> 34:08.047
Save it! What's he look like?

34:08.049 --> 34:10.340
Black. Lab.

34:10.341 --> 34:14.172
The dead ones are in the cold room.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.665
No, just a couple of poodles.

34:46.341 --> 34:48.418
I want my dog.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.797
- Listen, get out of here.
- No, you listen you little fuck.

34:53.799 --> 34:59.207
Off your ass, get my dog or I'll
stick the magazine down your throat.

34:59.507 --> 35:02.462
- We communicating now?
- Yeah, all right.

35:05.507 --> 35:07.916
Baker, right?

35:19.299 --> 35:21.631
How about a little light?

35:21.632 --> 35:23.876
Eddie!

35:24.632 --> 35:28.085
Forget it. He's still
circling the airport.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.631
I didn't know you were
coming home tonight.

35:31.632 --> 35:36.495
We sort of skipped the paperwork.

35:38.465 --> 35:41.338
Besides, it's Christmas, right?

35:44.590 --> 35:47.048
Where's your ma tonight?

35:47.632 --> 35:50.339
Out with Bigfoot again?

35:53.799 --> 35:55.923
Did you play her the solo?

35:55.924 --> 35:59.080
Maybe tomorrow, she said.

36:03.423 --> 36:06.296
Just you and me again, huh?

36:10.132 --> 36:12.375
From Hurley's?

36:14.465 --> 36:17.456
Eighty proof.
Think you can handle it?

36:23.840 --> 36:26.298
Go easy now.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.584
Jack?

36:34.590 --> 36:36.834
Yeah?

36:38.423 --> 36:42.505
Can I stay here tonight?
Even if she comes home alone?

36:44.465 --> 36:46.495
Okay.

37:00.548 --> 37:03.172
He's seeing you off, right?

37:05.132 --> 37:07.422
Jack, this is not possible.

37:07.423 --> 37:10.673
We're playing a resort hotel.
You can't take a dog.

37:10.674 --> 37:13.048
It's not possible.

37:13.757 --> 37:16.036
It's possible.

37:20.257 --> 37:22.297
Get this.
Each room is an event.

37:22.298 --> 37:24.798
An excursion into
unprecedented luxury.

37:24.799 --> 37:29.547
Outside, the adventure continues
with your own private terrace.

37:29.548 --> 37:32.338
You don't think it really
looks like that, do you?

37:33.049 --> 37:34.547
There are pictures right here.

37:34.548 --> 37:36.798
Hear that, Jack? Pictures.

37:36.799 --> 37:41.627
Welcome to the road, Dorothy.
You're about to lose your virginity.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.416
Why, thank you.

38:14.799 --> 38:17.706
I'll see you boys inside.

38:45.173 --> 38:48.256
I took the right
side of the closet.

38:48.257 --> 38:51.006
Since my bed's on the right,
I think it makes sense.

38:51.007 --> 38:54.578
- Right.
- We'll do the drawers the same.

38:56.049 --> 38:58.755
Unless you want the right.

38:59.340 --> 39:01.714
No, you take the right.

39:03.715 --> 39:07.464
Looks like Carmen Miranda
had an accident in my room.

39:07.465 --> 39:10.539
They must get a deal on these.

39:11.507 --> 39:13.506
What do you make of this?

39:13.507 --> 39:15.668
Kiwi.

39:15.841 --> 39:19.163
It's got more hair than you, Frank.

39:19.298 --> 39:22.289
No peeking at tub time.

39:36.382 --> 39:39.089
What the hell is this?

39:42.423 --> 39:45.414
Do you hear this?

39:46.423 --> 39:47.923
I do now.

39:47.924 --> 39:52.506
Great! Before we play a note,
we're gonna get thrown out.

39:52.507 --> 39:54.464
So she's playing a little music.

39:54.465 --> 39:57.131
She's got the Harry James
Orchestra in there!

39:57.132 --> 39:59.080
Ellington.

39:59.423 --> 40:00.631
Frank!

40:00.632 --> 40:02.710
What?

40:05.091 --> 40:06.965
You're looking a little tense.

40:06.966 --> 40:12.338
Of course! It's 2 AM and she's
going to wake up everyone!

40:15.966 --> 40:17.996
See?

40:29.674 --> 40:31.840
Massage?

40:31.841 --> 40:34.297
Down here, gorgeous.

40:38.340 --> 40:41.165
I figured you for jockeys.

40:41.966 --> 40:44.209
New socks?

40:58.764 --> 41:01.329
<i>The look</i>

41:01.330 --> 41:03.530
<i>Of love</i>

41:03.630 --> 41:05.830
<i>Is in</i>

41:06.131 --> 41:08.331
<i>Your eyes</i>

41:08.630 --> 41:10.830
<i>A look</i>

41:11.131 --> 41:15.830
<i>Your smile can't disguise</i>

41:18.131 --> 41:20.629
<i>The look</i>

41:20.630 --> 41:24.629
<i>Of love</i>

41:24.630 --> 41:27.629
<i>Is saying so much more</i>

41:27.630 --> 41:31.830
<i>Than just words could ever say</i>

41:34.630 --> 41:37.629
<i>And what my heart has heard</i>

41:37.630 --> 41:41.331
<i>Well, it takes my breath away</i>

41:42.630 --> 41:45.830
<i>I can hardly wait to hold you</i>

41:46.131 --> 41:48.830
<i>Feel my arms around you</i>

41:49.131 --> 41:52.629
<i>How long I have waited</i>

41:52.630 --> 41:54.629
<i>Waited just to love you</i>

41:54.630 --> 41:58.331
<i>Now that I have found you</i>

41:58.630 --> 42:03.331
<i>Don't ever go</i>

42:03.630 --> 42:08.130
<i>Don't ever go-oh-oh</i>

42:08.131 --> 42:13.331
<i>Don't ever go</i>

42:13.630 --> 42:19.830
<i>I love you so</i>

42:31.132 --> 42:33.548
Mark my words.

42:33.549 --> 42:37.089
From this night forward,
our lives will never be the same.

42:37.090 --> 42:42.297
Frank, you get a lot of pop out
of two glasses of champagne.

42:42.799 --> 42:45.339
Long way from "Hula
Girl Hideaway", eh?

42:45.340 --> 42:47.631
Remember? Banana
trees in the lobby.

42:47.632 --> 42:49.548
Takahama's Tahitian.

42:49.549 --> 42:51.256
Did we play there?

42:51.257 --> 42:54.339
- I thought we stopped for teriyaki.
- Three nights.

42:54.340 --> 42:57.881
It's amazing. He can remember
ever place we ever played.

42:57.882 --> 43:00.964
The day, the month, the year,
how many shows, you name it.

43:00.965 --> 43:03.423
When was Takahama's?

43:03.507 --> 43:05.506
August '74.

43:05.507 --> 43:09.078
See? He's brilliant.
Really!

43:10.382 --> 43:12.460
Brilliant!

43:12.965 --> 43:15.079
Hey, Jack.

43:17.465 --> 43:19.793
You are brilliant.

43:21.882 --> 43:23.506
Thanks.

43:23.507 --> 43:26.089
It's the same with music.
Should've seen him as a kid.

43:26.090 --> 43:29.339
Nobody could ride
the keys like Jack.

43:29.340 --> 43:32.715
Mrs. Simpson played something
once, and he had it.

43:32.716 --> 43:34.877
Really?

43:36.340 --> 43:39.339
I never won a single blue
ribbon until the day Jack

43:39.340 --> 43:42.840
showed up drunk at spring
recital and played

43:42.841 --> 43:46.798
"One O'clock Jump" instead
of "Clare de Lune".

43:46.799 --> 43:49.078
The mood just hit me.

44:03.882 --> 44:06.161
"Moonglow".

44:12.841 --> 44:15.047
- "Moonglow"?
- High school. I couldn't dance.

44:15.048 --> 44:18.590
Jack did the box step
with me for a week.

44:18.591 --> 44:21.506
It wasn't a week.

44:21.507 --> 44:24.256
- You two are that close?
- He paid me.

44:24.257 --> 44:28.673
It was my first social with Donna.
We fell in love on the dance floor.

44:28.674 --> 44:31.964
I have a beautiful wife,
two beautiful children,

44:31.965 --> 44:34.089
all because of my brother.

44:34.090 --> 44:36.839
You overestimate the box step.

44:36.840 --> 44:40.256
It was just like this,
on our honeymoon.

44:40.257 --> 44:43.590
The moon, the stars.

44:43.591 --> 44:45.173
Remember, Jack?

44:45.174 --> 44:47.501
I wasn't there.

44:47.923 --> 44:49.423
Right.

44:49.424 --> 44:52.912
My first solo gig.

44:56.757 --> 44:59.166
God, she was gorgeous.

45:00.757 --> 45:03.665
I couldn't believe she was mine.

45:06.132 --> 45:08.957
How come I got so lucky, Jack?

45:09.382 --> 45:11.631
You're a lucky guy.

45:11.632 --> 45:13.339
You know?

45:13.340 --> 45:17.007
I never kissed my wife
on New Year's Eve.

45:17.549 --> 45:22.329
I'm always on stage somewhere.

45:26.840 --> 45:29.173
I think I'm drunk.
You two dance.

45:29.174 --> 45:30.423
I'm gonna...

45:30.424 --> 45:32.089
go sit with the wallflowers.

45:32.090 --> 45:34.631
I'm not used to leading.

45:36.632 --> 45:39.131
Come on, give the girl a glide.

45:39.132 --> 45:43.165
No. I think your little brother
prefers to dance alone.

45:46.174 --> 45:48.418
No, thanks.

45:50.798 --> 45:53.955
I never touch French cigarettes.

46:13.632 --> 46:15.839
Your brother's a good dancer.

46:15.840 --> 46:17.465
Big heartbreaker.

46:17.466 --> 46:21.006
A couple of turns, that was it.

46:21.007 --> 46:22.756
Really?

46:22.757 --> 46:24.673
Got them right in the knees.

46:24.674 --> 46:28.162
Practically had to carry
the girls off the floor.

46:28.215 --> 46:30.294
Really?

46:31.340 --> 46:33.839
Have another drink, Frank.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.256
No, I'm sleepy.

46:35.257 --> 46:37.963
Go to sleep then.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.329
Alright.

46:59.591 --> 47:02.711
I think I just lost my chaperone.

47:02.923 --> 47:05.251
You're safe.

47:09.673 --> 47:13.293
So where do you keep your
blue ribbons, Mr. Baker?

47:14.632 --> 47:17.006
Frank keeps them.

47:27.049 --> 47:29.590
Nice night, huh?

47:36.215 --> 47:38.791
It's quiet, it's like...

47:38.965 --> 47:42.122
the whole world is asleep.

47:46.382 --> 47:48.496
Careful.

47:49.507 --> 47:52.463
I had too much to drink.

47:52.549 --> 47:55.752
Champagne goes right to my head.

47:58.007 --> 48:01.460
- Maybe we should call it a night.
- Yeah.

48:28.424 --> 48:30.667
Miss Diamond!

48:34.798 --> 48:36.923
These just arrived for you.

48:36.924 --> 48:39.748
Looks like you have an admirer.

48:40.507 --> 48:42.131
There's no card.

48:42.132 --> 48:44.714
The gentleman said he would
be in contact with you.

48:44.715 --> 48:49.173
He's with the cat food convention.
I can have put them in water.

48:49.174 --> 48:51.335
No, that's alright.

50:05.548 --> 50:07.710
It's nice.

50:09.007 --> 50:11.204
It's nice.

50:21.965 --> 50:26.381
It's been 5 years since I've
seen you without a cigarette.

50:26.382 --> 50:29.340
The whole room upstairs
smells like an ashtray.

50:29.341 --> 50:32.381
You know that? The sheets,

50:32.382 --> 50:37.127
the carpets, the drapes.
The towels, my tux, my shirt.

50:37.299 --> 50:39.131
Want to smell my shirt?

50:39.132 --> 50:40.839
Maybe later.

50:40.840 --> 50:44.506
I'm not kidding. Do you know
what an insidious habit that is?

50:44.507 --> 50:49.666
How many do you smoke a day?
Must be hundreds!

50:51.715 --> 50:56.081
This is just a wild stab, but
is something bothering you?

50:57.632 --> 50:59.631
Leave her alone.

50:59.632 --> 51:01.506
I mean it.

51:01.507 --> 51:05.298
This isn't a hatcheck girl you can
leave behind at the Sheraton.

51:05.299 --> 51:08.206
You've got two shows
a night with her.

51:10.382 --> 51:12.340
You don't know what you're saying.

51:12.341 --> 51:15.547
I know trouble, and it's
name starts with 'S'.

51:15.548 --> 51:17.756
Do me a favor, Frank. Relax.

51:17.757 --> 51:22.798
Do me a favor, little brother.
Stick to cocktail waitresses.

51:29.299 --> 51:30.839
Meeting here each night,

51:30.840 --> 51:33.839
sharing these few moments,

51:33.840 --> 51:37.173
I feel as if we're becoming
one big happy family.

51:37.174 --> 51:40.798
The fine wine, the music...

51:40.799 --> 51:43.547
What's all this mean?
I don't know. Who's to say?

51:43.548 --> 51:45.173
All I can tell you is...

51:45.174 --> 51:48.173
it makes it very
special for us here...

51:48.174 --> 51:51.173
to have you out there.
Right, Susie?

51:51.174 --> 51:52.589
Right, Frank.

51:52.590 --> 51:54.173
Right, Jack?

51:54.174 --> 51:55.798
Right.

51:55.799 --> 51:59.506
But if I can add one more thing.

51:59.507 --> 52:01.916
I love you, Frank.

52:02.299 --> 52:04.247
What?

52:05.507 --> 52:07.704
I love you.

52:08.299 --> 52:10.839
I just wanted to say it.

52:17.590 --> 52:20.672
You came in late on
"Little Green Apples".

52:20.673 --> 52:23.415
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

52:23.840 --> 52:27.164
No, Frank.
You came in early.

52:27.715 --> 52:32.543
- You have for the past decade.
- I never missed a beat.

52:32.757 --> 52:35.090
I never miss the beat!

52:35.091 --> 52:37.880
That's because you make it up.

52:38.091 --> 52:39.881
Take it back.

52:39.882 --> 52:41.631
Take it back?
What's this, the 3rd grade?

52:41.632 --> 52:43.839
Take it back!

52:43.840 --> 52:46.463
Take a kiwi, Frank.

52:50.007 --> 52:53.542
Go to bed, Frank,
or this will get ugly.

52:53.757 --> 52:56.339
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.

52:56.340 --> 52:58.714
It's the fucking Newlywed Game.

52:58.715 --> 53:02.169
- You hit me.
- I told you I was going to.

53:13.340 --> 53:16.213
Hello? Yeah.

53:18.007 --> 53:21.048
No, this is 512-B.

53:21.049 --> 53:24.335
Mr. Baker is in 512-A.

53:28.757 --> 53:30.506
Urgent.

53:30.507 --> 53:33.711
No, never mind. I'll get him.

53:35.382 --> 53:37.464
We made a deal.

53:37.465 --> 53:39.756
Training wheels for a
month, then we would see.

53:39.757 --> 53:41.297
He ran into somebody's car?

53:41.298 --> 53:44.965
Mrs. Ramadino's station wagon. It wasn't
moving. It was parked down the street.

53:44.966 --> 53:46.756
Barely made it out of the driveway.

53:46.757 --> 53:50.755
Got a pencil? Pencil anybody?

53:51.257 --> 53:52.173
Here.

53:52.174 --> 53:55.714
I want you to take down
the New Year show.

53:55.715 --> 53:58.090
10 o'clock you start with
"Thanks for the Memories".

53:58.091 --> 54:00.673
- Then you segue into...
- "Happy Days Are Here Again".

54:00.674 --> 54:05.288
- I know the show.
- Then the song from Camelot.

54:08.715 --> 54:10.839
Don't hesitate to call.

54:10.840 --> 54:12.919
Come on.

54:18.298 --> 54:21.005
Any word from Egghead?

54:22.924 --> 54:26.756
I saved you the crossword.

54:29.257 --> 54:31.287
Thanks.

54:47.465 --> 54:49.745
Well, happy reading.

57:30.132 --> 57:32.162
Hear anything yet?

57:32.257 --> 57:34.335
Not a peep.

57:37.132 --> 57:40.004
I'm going to take a bath.

58:00.882 --> 58:04.297
Yeah?

58:04.298 --> 58:06.460
It's Frank.

58:06.507 --> 58:08.786
So how's little Frank?

58:09.090 --> 58:12.127
Good. That's a relief.

58:13.132 --> 58:15.715
No, I understand.
Call me when you have time.

58:15.716 --> 58:17.960
<i>What are you doing?</i>

58:18.674 --> 58:21.000
We're taking a bath.

58:21.007 --> 58:23.381
I mean...

58:23.424 --> 58:26.965
Susie's taking a bath.
I'm doing the crossword puzzle.

58:26.966 --> 58:28.381
Okay.

58:28.382 --> 58:30.412
Bye.

58:31.674 --> 58:33.715
Kid's in the pink.

58:33.716 --> 58:35.794
Good.

58:41.030 --> 58:44.029
<i>Another bride</i>

58:44.030 --> 58:47.528
<i>Another June</i>

58:47.529 --> 58:52.029
<i>Another sunny</i>

58:52.030 --> 58:55.029
<i>Honeymoon</i>

58:55.030 --> 58:58.528
<i>Another season</i>

58:58.529 --> 59:02.230
<i>Another reason...</i>

59:03.030 --> 59:05.729
<i>For makin' whoopee</i>

59:18.030 --> 59:21.029
<i>A lot of shoes</i>

59:21.030 --> 59:23.729
<i>A lot of rice</i>

59:24.529 --> 59:28.528
<i>The groom is nervous</i>

59:28.529 --> 59:32.029
<i>He answers twice</i>

59:32.030 --> 59:35.528
<i>It's really killing</i>

59:35.529 --> 59:39.528
<i>That he's so willing</i>

59:39.529 --> 59:42.729
<i>To make whoopee</i>

59:49.030 --> 59:54.230
<i>Picture a little love nest</i>

59:56.529 --> 01:00:01.729
<i>Down where the roses cling</i>

01:00:03.529 --> 01:00:10.230
<i>Picture that same sweet love nest</i>

01:00:11.529 --> 01:00:15.729
<i>Think what a year can bring</i>

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.729
<i>He's washin' dishes</i>

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:24.029
<i>And baby clothes</i>

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:27.528
<i>He's so ambitious</i>

01:00:27.529 --> 01:00:31.230
<i>He even sews</i>

01:00:31.529 --> 01:00:34.528
<i>But don't forget, folks</i>

01:00:34.529 --> 01:00:39.029
<i>That's what you get, folks</i>

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:41.729
<i>For makin' whoopee</i>

01:00:46.529 --> 01:00:49.729
<i>For makin' whoopee</i>

01:00:53.646 --> 01:00:56.846
<i>For makin' whoopee</i>

01:01:02.145 --> 01:01:05.645
<i>For makin'</i>

01:01:05.646 --> 01:01:10.846
<i>Whoopee</i>

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:37.006
<i>Boys and girls, find a friend.
This is it!</i>

01:01:37.007 --> 01:01:41.756
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

01:01:41.757 --> 01:01:46.214
six, five, four, three...

01:01:46.215 --> 01:01:49.040
two, one...

01:02:45.798 --> 01:02:48.042
So...

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:51.248
make any resolutions?

01:02:52.299 --> 01:02:54.626
No. You?

01:02:55.882 --> 01:02:59.715
No. I figure that stuff is
a bunch of crap anyway.

01:03:00.965 --> 01:03:04.371
- You do what you do, right?
- That's right.

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:10.497
Old Egghead would've blown a
gasket seeing us here tonight!

01:03:15.632 --> 01:03:18.290
You're good, aren't you?

01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:27.298
I can carry a tune.

01:03:28.132 --> 01:03:30.542
You're better than that.

01:03:38.591 --> 01:03:41.332
I saw you guys once.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:45.631
You and Frank.

01:03:46.632 --> 01:03:48.959
At the Roosevelt.

01:03:49.798 --> 01:03:52.505
Must've been a cheap date.

01:03:55.174 --> 01:03:57.089
Soap convention.

01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:59.252
Soap?

01:03:59.549 --> 01:04:02.548
Yeah, they got a
convention for everything.

01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:05.918
The guy was some
big roller in suds.

01:04:08.673 --> 01:04:13.833
At least he was clean.
Some guys you wouldn't believe.

01:04:17.174 --> 01:04:20.330
The older ones,
they weren't so bad.

01:04:20.507 --> 01:04:23.506
Nice. Polite.

01:04:23.507 --> 01:04:26.213
Pulled you chair out for you.

01:04:28.049 --> 01:04:30.506
But the younger ones...

01:04:37.382 --> 01:04:39.797
It wasn't so bad.
I'd get a nice piece of steak,

01:04:39.798 --> 01:04:42.423
flowers, sometimes even a gift.

01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:44.756
Usually whatever the guy was into.

01:04:44.757 --> 01:04:47.996
I got a set of socket
wrenches once.

01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:54.121
Guy looked at me like he'd
given me 4 dozen roses.

01:04:58.882 --> 01:05:02.453
But I stayed at the
Hartford one time.

01:05:04.757 --> 01:05:09.589
You should see the rooms.
All satin and velvet.

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:11.006
And the bed...

01:05:11.007 --> 01:05:15.254
royal blue, trimmed in
lace clean as snow.

01:05:17.549 --> 01:05:21.712
Hard to believe a room like
that don't change your life.

01:05:22.673 --> 01:05:24.506
But it don't.

01:05:24.507 --> 01:05:27.131
The bed may be magic,

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.624
but the mirror isn't.

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:33.247
Still wake up the same old Susie.

01:05:37.007 --> 01:05:38.839
I didn't always.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.168
You know, I mean...

01:05:41.424 --> 01:05:44.130
if I liked the guy.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:51.625
I never liked the
Hartford much myself.

01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:06.381
My neck, it's so tight.

01:06:06.382 --> 01:06:09.215
Usually singing relaxes me.

01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:12.040
But tonight...

01:06:18.257 --> 01:06:20.335
Thanks.

01:08:48.049 --> 01:08:51.667
You'd make a hell of a
fireman, you know that?

01:08:57.216 --> 01:09:00.917
Do you practice that at
home with a stopwatch?

01:09:03.091 --> 01:09:05.368
I didn't want to wake you.

01:09:06.423 --> 01:09:08.798
I'm an early riser.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:20.203
I didn't expect you to buy
be a corsage this morning.

01:09:22.465 --> 01:09:25.089
Your high school ring is safe.

01:09:47.465 --> 01:09:49.578
Shit!

01:09:53.131 --> 01:09:55.246
Shit!

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.506
<i>That takes care of
the week of the 5th.</i>

01:10:34.507 --> 01:10:38.339
After that, we got the Avedon
or the Plaza, 4 day turn.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.714
What do you think, Jack?

01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:44.006
You with me, Jack?

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:46.339
The Avedon's a dump.

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.256
There's no cover, no minimum.
They water their drinks.

01:10:49.257 --> 01:10:51.965
Strictly the Fuller Brush crowd.

01:10:51.966 --> 01:10:56.461
It's not that bad. Besides,
Blacky Carson books the Avedon.

01:10:57.132 --> 01:10:59.790
He's always been good to us.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:04.673
- He hasn't been that good.
- Okay, we'll take the Plaza.

01:11:04.674 --> 01:11:07.965
- Then the Capri for 5 days.
- Not the Luau Lounge again.

01:11:07.966 --> 01:11:10.631
What the matter?
They don't salt their peanuts?

01:11:10.632 --> 01:11:13.464
Singing "Feelings",
knee-deep in paper orchids

01:11:13.465 --> 01:11:15.547
and plastic Tiki lamps

01:11:15.548 --> 01:11:19.831
is not my idea of a fun evening.

01:11:20.549 --> 01:11:23.464
Fun? Who promised you fun?
We get paid, remember?

01:11:23.465 --> 01:11:26.586
I'm saying, maybe we
should vote on it.

01:11:29.924 --> 01:11:32.006
Maybe we should ask
Jack what he thinks.

01:11:32.007 --> 01:11:34.714
I don't have to.
I know what he thinks.

01:11:34.715 --> 01:11:38.250
It's 5 days, the money's green.
We're there.

01:11:40.091 --> 01:11:43.297
Speaking about "Feelings",
you might brush up on the lyrics.

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:46.090
The other night, you sang
the first verse twice.

01:11:46.091 --> 01:11:48.214
Really?

01:11:48.215 --> 01:11:51.798
That explains the gasps I
heard from the audience.

01:11:51.799 --> 01:11:56.839
We trashed the Avedon, the Luau.
What's your beef with "Feelings"?

01:11:56.840 --> 01:11:59.002
Nothing.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.631
Except, who cares?

01:12:03.632 --> 01:12:05.965
Does anybody really
need to hear "Feelings"

01:12:05.966 --> 01:12:08.422
again in a lifetime?

01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:10.464
It's like parsley.

01:12:10.465 --> 01:12:12.756
Take it away, nobody
knows the difference.

01:12:12.757 --> 01:12:14.756
"Feelings" isn't parsley.

01:12:14.757 --> 01:12:18.256
To you, "Feelings"
may be filet mignon.

01:12:18.257 --> 01:12:21.381
To me, it's parsley.
Less than parsley.

01:12:21.382 --> 01:12:24.339
Look, "Feelings", despite
what you think of it,

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.006
is always a bright moment
and a crowd-pleaser.

01:12:27.007 --> 01:12:30.756
Consequently, we have an
obligation to perform it.

01:12:30.757 --> 01:12:33.297
The audience would be disappointed.

01:12:33.298 --> 01:12:37.249
They weren't crying
on New Year's Eve.

01:12:42.215 --> 01:12:44.006
You passed over "Feelings"?

01:12:44.007 --> 01:12:46.121
Yeah.

01:12:46.465 --> 01:12:47.673
And...

01:12:47.674 --> 01:12:51.044
"Bali Hai" went out with
the bath water, too.

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:56.704
I see.

01:12:56.799 --> 01:13:00.381
The cat goes away and the
mice take over the orchestra.

01:13:00.382 --> 01:13:01.422
Hey,

01:13:01.423 --> 01:13:03.048
I ain't no mouse.

01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:05.672
That's right. You're parsley.

01:13:11.091 --> 01:13:15.337
This food's been sitting here
too long. It's making me sick.

01:13:24.882 --> 01:13:27.837
Why don't you loosen the leash?

01:13:27.924 --> 01:13:32.965
Let's not let a whiff of perfume
blow off 15 years. Be reasonable.

01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:37.794
I play 300 nights a year with you.
Is that reasonable enough?

01:15:13.757 --> 01:15:16.499
Can I have a double vodka, please?

01:16:13.173 --> 01:16:16.662
I was in the neighborhood.

01:16:28.215 --> 01:16:32.130
Listen, don't get nervous.
I just came by to...

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.621
talk.

01:17:05.549 --> 01:17:08.539
I guess you found him, huh?

01:17:11.007 --> 01:17:13.037
Yeah.

01:17:15.257 --> 01:17:17.548
I came to walk Eddie.

01:17:17.549 --> 01:17:19.579
Come.

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:52.631
Terry's Tap Room.

01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:57.706
First gig we ever played.

01:17:58.424 --> 01:18:01.298
The owner gave us that bottle,
but wouldn't open it.

01:18:01.299 --> 01:18:02.839
How come?

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.748
Told us to save it.

01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:10.631
He said someday it would soften
the edges of the bad times.

01:18:10.632 --> 01:18:13.871
And make the good ones
seem even better.

01:18:15.882 --> 01:18:20.047
We should've drunk it before
we played Terry's Tap Room.

01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:22.423
Want some coffee?

01:18:29.299 --> 01:18:31.578
You want to leave?

01:18:32.424 --> 01:18:34.502
Listen.

01:18:36.007 --> 01:18:39.293
The reason I came last night is...

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:43.631
I'm thinking about leaving.

01:18:43.632 --> 01:18:45.711
The act.

01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:53.006
I met this guy at New
Year's at the Hotel.

01:18:53.007 --> 01:18:56.330
And he liked my voice.

01:18:57.882 --> 01:19:02.129
He thinks I can sell cat food
just by singing about it.

01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:05.584
It's crazy, huh?

01:19:08.299 --> 01:19:09.881
Take it.

01:19:09.882 --> 01:19:14.256
I haven't decided yet.
I'm just thinking about it.

01:19:14.257 --> 01:19:16.536
No, take it.

01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:27.377
How long have you been taking
care of the kid upstairs?

01:19:27.466 --> 01:19:29.958
I don't take care of her.

01:19:30.007 --> 01:19:31.964
Didn't look that way to me.

01:19:31.965 --> 01:19:34.209
What's the difference?

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:40.422
Anyway, I know Frank has
us booked through March.

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.381
Don't worry about Frank.

01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:46.131
What about you?

01:19:46.132 --> 01:19:48.790
What's that to do with anything?

01:19:50.757 --> 01:19:55.586
Nothing. I don't want to leave
you guys with an empty mike.

01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:59.957
There's always another girl.

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.120
Right.

01:20:17.382 --> 01:20:19.874
Thanks for the advice.

01:20:20.132 --> 01:20:22.329
I'll think it over.

01:20:44.278 --> 01:20:45.978
<i>Teardrops</i>

01:20:48.278 --> 01:20:53.478
<i>Falling down on my face</i>

01:20:54.278 --> 01:20:58.478
<i>Trying to forget my</i>

01:20:59.778 --> 01:21:04.478
<i>Feelings of love</i>

01:21:07.278 --> 01:21:10.277
<i>Feelings</i>

01:21:10.278 --> 01:21:15.978
<i>For all my life I'll feel it</i>

01:21:17.278 --> 01:21:22.478
<i>I wish I'd never met you, boy</i>

01:21:23.278 --> 01:21:27.978
<i>You'll never come again</i>

01:21:37.215 --> 01:21:40.087
I told Frank I'm quitting.

01:21:41.174 --> 01:21:43.418
Congratulations.

01:21:44.215 --> 01:21:46.377
As of now.

01:21:51.382 --> 01:21:54.881
If you need a recommendation,
you let me know.

01:21:54.882 --> 01:21:58.048
Jesus you're cold! You know that?

01:21:58.049 --> 01:22:00.839
You are like a fucking razor blade.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:04.376
Careful, you'll have me thinking
you're going soft on me.

01:22:05.382 --> 01:22:09.582
You don't give a fuck, do you?
About anything.

01:22:10.424 --> 01:22:12.964
What do you want from me?
To tell you to stay?

01:22:12.965 --> 01:22:17.631
Beg on my knees for you to
save the Baker Boys from doom?

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.465
Forget it, sweetheart.

01:22:19.466 --> 01:22:22.881
We survived for 15 years before
you strutted on the scene.

01:22:22.882 --> 01:22:26.506
Two seconds and you're
bawling like a baby.

01:22:26.507 --> 01:22:30.209
You should be wearing a
diaper, not a dress.

01:22:31.007 --> 01:22:33.714
You and he are
brothers, aren't you?

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.506
Let me tell you something.

01:22:35.507 --> 01:22:40.298
They've dropped like flies.
We're still here!

01:22:40.299 --> 01:22:43.173
We've never held a day
job in our lives.

01:22:43.174 --> 01:22:46.547
He's an easy target,
but add it up, he's done fine.

01:22:46.548 --> 01:22:48.714
Yeah, Frank has done great.

01:22:48.715 --> 01:22:53.048
He has the wife, kids,
little house in the suburbs.

01:22:53.049 --> 01:22:56.256
While his brother lives a shitty
apartment with a sick dog,

01:22:56.257 --> 01:22:59.256
Little Orphan Annie and a chip on
his shoulder size of a Cadillac.

01:22:59.257 --> 01:23:03.256
Listen, Princess. We
fucked twice, that's it.

01:23:03.257 --> 01:23:06.839
Once the sweat dries, you
still know shit about me.

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.089
I know one thing. While
Frank put his kids to bed,

01:23:11.090 --> 01:23:15.338
little brother Jack was
dusting off his dreams.

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:18.173
I was there.

01:23:18.174 --> 01:23:20.714
I saw it in your face.

01:23:20.924 --> 01:23:24.672
You're full of shit.
You're a fake.

01:23:24.673 --> 01:23:27.547
Every time you walk
in those places,

01:23:27.548 --> 01:23:30.291
you're selling yourself cheap.

01:23:30.715 --> 01:23:33.839
I know all about that.
I find myself at the end of the night

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:37.173
with some creep, and I tell
myself it doesn't matter.

01:23:37.174 --> 01:23:41.089
You kid yourself you've got this
empty place inside to put it.

01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:44.709
But do it long enough
and all you are is empty.

01:23:45.216 --> 01:23:48.455
I didn't know whores
were so philosophical.

01:23:49.132 --> 01:23:52.123
At least my brother's not my pimp.

01:23:53.924 --> 01:23:56.589
I had you pegged for a loser
the first time I saw you.

01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:59.167
But you're worse.

01:23:59.216 --> 01:24:01.459
You're a coward.

01:24:11.382 --> 01:24:14.798
My name is Frank Baker

01:24:14.799 --> 01:24:18.381
and you know my brother Jack.

01:24:18.382 --> 01:24:23.162
My brother and I have been
playing together for...

01:24:24.090 --> 01:24:25.839
I don't know.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:27.954
Jack?

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:30.877
31 years.

01:24:30.924 --> 01:24:33.090
But of course, back then...

01:24:33.091 --> 01:24:35.832
it was a little different.

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:41.256
We were just kids.

01:24:41.257 --> 01:24:45.622
The only one who'd listen to
us was the family cat, Cecil.

01:24:47.924 --> 01:24:51.838
We must've shaved two
lives off that cat, huh?

01:25:15.216 --> 01:25:17.329
Sorry.

01:25:23.007 --> 01:25:25.090
We're not getting paid then.

01:25:25.091 --> 01:25:28.875
I told you, it's a telethon.
No one gets a cent.

01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:33.298
What's it for?

01:25:33.299 --> 01:25:35.256
I don't know, some disease.

01:25:35.257 --> 01:25:37.963
What channel is it on?

01:25:38.548 --> 01:25:40.710
71.

01:25:44.174 --> 01:25:47.173
71? What is 71?

01:25:47.174 --> 01:25:51.215
A channel, just a little further
down the dial. It's publicity.

01:25:51.216 --> 01:25:54.123
Publicity's publicity, right?

01:25:55.423 --> 01:25:57.453
Right.

01:26:10.174 --> 01:26:12.452
I'll see when we're on.

01:26:23.674 --> 01:26:25.631
What's wrong with the kid.

01:26:25.632 --> 01:26:29.832
Tore his knee playing St Joseph's
just before the accident.

01:26:31.132 --> 01:26:32.339
Accident?

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.923
The fire.

01:26:33.924 --> 01:26:39.296
Rate we're going, we'll be lucky to
buy jockstraps, let alone a gym.

01:26:41.882 --> 01:26:43.839
Earl the pearl!

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.045
We're on after Mr. Basketball.

01:26:50.548 --> 01:26:53.753
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

01:26:53.757 --> 01:26:55.714
We're playing for a
God damn gymnasium.

01:26:55.715 --> 01:26:58.505
Let's hear it for Jimmy Marshall.

01:26:58.966 --> 01:27:01.422
Most of you know Jimmy
twisted that knee

01:27:01.423 --> 01:27:03.714
trying to win one for good
old Lahuga High this year.

01:27:03.715 --> 01:27:07.006
Luckily, the doctors tell us that
Jimmy will play next season.

01:27:07.007 --> 01:27:09.673
That's where you come in.
Pick up the phone. Make a donation.

01:27:09.674 --> 01:27:14.584
Keep our kids off the
street and into the gym.

01:27:15.757 --> 01:27:16.965
All right!

01:27:16.966 --> 01:27:19.297
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:27:19.298 --> 01:27:21.673
We are pleased to have

01:27:21.674 --> 01:27:25.506
two of the most respected men in
the musical entertainment field.

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:28.256
The Fabulous Bunker Boys!

01:27:28.257 --> 01:27:30.536
Come on, you guys.

01:27:32.007 --> 01:27:34.464
Nice suits, fellas.

01:27:38.216 --> 01:27:42.006
A lot of amateur musicians will
wanna rap with these guys,

01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:46.673
and as soon as they're finished,
they'll be manning the phones.

01:27:46.674 --> 01:27:48.048
All right.

01:27:48.049 --> 01:27:51.335
What are we waiting for?
Take it away, guys.

01:28:09.632 --> 01:28:12.839
We know what that means.
Time to turn the big board over.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.006
I'm afraid you guys will
have to wait a few minutes.

01:28:15.007 --> 01:28:16.464
Jack!

01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:20.380
I don't know about you, but I
sense electricity in the air.

01:28:20.715 --> 01:28:22.464
Alright, what do you think?

01:28:22.465 --> 01:28:25.124
Okay, let's do it.

01:28:28.049 --> 01:28:29.381
Play some music!

01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:31.875
Go fuck yourself, bud.

01:28:35.465 --> 01:28:38.622
Who the hell do you think
you are, Liberace?

01:28:41.966 --> 01:28:44.127
Are you okay?

01:28:50.257 --> 01:28:53.164
We just passed the car, Jack.

01:28:53.549 --> 01:28:56.256
Where the hell are you going?
You going to talk to me?

01:28:56.257 --> 01:28:59.381
Or is this Jack's
famous silent act?

01:28:59.382 --> 01:29:01.339
It was for publicity, understand?

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:04.959
- Publicity!
- Are you a fucking moron?

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:08.422
It's three in the morning.
Who's watching, paper boys?

01:29:08.423 --> 01:29:10.714
I didn't know when we
were on till yesterday.

01:29:10.715 --> 01:29:13.339
- Basketballs.
- Okay.

01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:15.464
You had us playing for basketballs.

01:29:15.465 --> 01:29:20.329
I screwed up, but that you
don't walk out on a gig.

01:29:20.507 --> 01:29:22.256
What?

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:24.880
It wasn't professional, Jack.

01:29:25.298 --> 01:29:30.458
What's happened to you?
Now you like kissing ass?

01:29:30.507 --> 01:29:34.588
You let that guy turn
us into clowns tonight.

01:29:34.882 --> 01:29:38.453
We were always small time.
We were never clowns.

01:29:40.382 --> 01:29:42.412
What's happened to your dignity.

01:29:43.382 --> 01:29:46.673
Who the hell are you
to talk about dignity?

01:29:46.674 --> 01:29:48.631
This where you get your dignity?

01:29:48.632 --> 01:29:51.706
Let's do it straight for once.

01:29:52.507 --> 01:29:55.581
I want to explain something
to you, little brother.

01:29:55.799 --> 01:29:59.048
There are people in this
world who depend on me.

01:29:59.049 --> 01:30:02.256
I got a wife and kids
who expect to wake up

01:30:02.257 --> 01:30:04.923
with food on the table
and heat in the house.

01:30:04.924 --> 01:30:07.756
I got a mortgage.
I got car payments.

01:30:07.757 --> 01:30:11.297
And I got you, my
little brother Jack.

01:30:11.298 --> 01:30:14.006
He's so hip, so cool and sure
that he's better than everyone.

01:30:14.007 --> 01:30:16.798
Don't you think I'd like to walk
up to one of those assholes

01:30:16.799 --> 01:30:18.297
and blow smoke in his face?

01:30:18.298 --> 01:30:20.957
God damn right I would!

01:30:21.132 --> 01:30:24.423
But I can't.
I have to be responsible.

01:30:24.424 --> 01:30:27.506
I have to make the numbers
balance in my favor every month

01:30:27.507 --> 01:30:31.754
so everyone else can go
on living their lives.

01:30:32.465 --> 01:30:36.756
There's no medals but you'd
notice if I closed up shop.

01:30:36.757 --> 01:30:42.047
Don't talk to me about dignity.
You're playing a weak hand.

01:30:42.424 --> 01:30:45.548
Terrific! Walk away.

01:30:45.549 --> 01:30:47.381
You're good at that, Jack.

01:30:47.382 --> 01:30:51.464
You never commit to anything.
Even a conversation.

01:30:51.465 --> 01:30:53.464
Is that what that was?

01:30:53.465 --> 01:30:55.381
Felt like a speech to me.

01:30:55.382 --> 01:30:58.047
Next time, save it for the PTA.

01:30:58.048 --> 01:31:02.461
You couldn't keep your
cock in your pocket.

01:31:07.757 --> 01:31:09.881
Who I fuck...

01:31:09.882 --> 01:31:12.506
and who I don't fuck is none
of your fucking business.

01:31:12.507 --> 01:31:15.131
It is when it effects my business.

01:31:15.132 --> 01:31:18.381
- Your business?
- Yeah.

01:31:18.382 --> 01:31:21.423
It exists because of me.

01:31:21.424 --> 01:31:23.585
You?

01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.715
I make the calendar.
I pay the expenses.

01:31:27.716 --> 01:31:30.423
Christ, I even make sure
your shoes are shined.

01:31:30.424 --> 01:31:31.923
What do you do?

01:31:31.924 --> 01:31:34.381
You show up for a couple of hours
a night and smoke cigarettes.

01:31:34.382 --> 01:31:37.589
If somebody requested "Chopsticks"
you'd ask for the sheet music.

01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:42.047
If not for me, you'd be playing for
dimes from the back of a truck.

01:31:42.048 --> 01:31:44.506
Yeah, you're a real pro, Frank.

01:31:44.507 --> 01:31:46.881
You did a bang up job:

01:31:46.882 --> 01:31:49.965
You had them paying us not to play!

01:31:49.966 --> 01:31:52.339
That's fucking genius.

01:31:54.882 --> 01:31:57.375
Asshole, what are you doing?

01:31:57.382 --> 01:31:59.840
What the fuck are you doing?

01:32:00.924 --> 01:32:02.840
That is it!

01:32:02.841 --> 01:32:05.333
Jack!

01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:17.715
Fucking little brother beat
the shit out of you, huh?

01:32:17.716 --> 01:32:20.256
Jack, my hand!

01:32:26.924 --> 01:32:30.128
I'm through.
I can't do it anymore.

01:32:47.561 --> 01:32:50.443
<i>Who can take the sunrise</i>

01:32:50.444 --> 01:32:52.943
<i>Sprinkle it with dew</i>

01:32:52.944 --> 01:32:54.943
<i>Toss it in the air</i>

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:57.144
<i>And make a groovy lemon pie</i>

01:32:57.194 --> 01:32:58.394
<i>The candy man can</i>

01:33:00.090 --> 01:33:02.922
You're one of those Fabulous guys.

01:33:02.923 --> 01:33:05.964
- I remember.
- I don't remember.

01:33:05.965 --> 01:33:10.298
You can't kid me.
I see you here every night.

01:33:10.299 --> 01:33:13.047
That's why I took the job.

01:33:13.048 --> 01:33:17.381
I come in, I see you and your
brother's faces hanging there,

01:33:17.382 --> 01:33:20.298
I figured it was a sign.

01:33:20.299 --> 01:33:22.921
Like destiny.

01:33:25.424 --> 01:33:27.089
How are you doing, Monica?

01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:30.631
Well, only it's Blanche here.

01:33:30.632 --> 01:33:32.829
Don't touch that.

01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:35.962
That's three hours cold.

01:33:36.674 --> 01:33:41.798
I've been standing over here
waiting for you to wake up.

01:33:41.799 --> 01:33:47.089
Finally I figured maybe
you had an appointment.

01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:49.120
Here you go.

01:33:50.465 --> 01:33:51.964
Boy, it's weird, huh?

01:33:51.965 --> 01:33:56.875
You meet someone, think you'll
never see them again...

01:34:01.424 --> 01:34:05.172
Guess you got caught
in the rain, huh?

01:34:06.048 --> 01:34:08.920
Yeah, I got caught in the rain.

01:34:11.465 --> 01:34:13.745
What time do you punch out?

01:34:14.507 --> 01:34:16.537
What?

01:34:17.132 --> 01:34:19.625
What time do you punch out?

01:34:23.048 --> 01:34:25.838
You're my last ticket.

01:34:35.007 --> 01:34:38.081
Button up on the way home, Blanche.

01:34:39.549 --> 01:34:41.958
It's cold out there.

01:34:59.716 --> 01:35:01.465
Hi, Jack.

01:35:01.466 --> 01:35:03.958
I took Eddie out.

01:35:10.923 --> 01:35:15.585
Be sure to take that tux in.
I can drop it off this afternoon.

01:35:16.674 --> 01:35:19.415
Will you stop that, please?

01:35:19.466 --> 01:35:22.047
Want me to make some coffee?

01:35:22.048 --> 01:35:25.454
How about I make some eggs?

01:35:27.549 --> 01:35:30.173
Knock if off with that thing.

01:35:30.174 --> 01:35:32.590
You're driving me nuts.

01:35:32.591 --> 01:35:34.797
Jack, you want eggs?
Jack, you want coffee?

01:35:34.798 --> 01:35:40.041
I can't baby-sit you every
time your mama gets an itch.

01:35:55.257 --> 01:35:57.454
What are you looking at?

01:36:36.007 --> 01:36:38.879
You're having a bad day, right?

01:36:41.549 --> 01:36:43.579
Right.

01:36:44.466 --> 01:36:46.496
It's okay.

01:36:46.549 --> 01:36:50.831
My mom had a lot of those.
Sometimes that's why I came down.

01:37:06.882 --> 01:37:09.126
What do you say...

01:37:09.299 --> 01:37:12.839
we go over to the Empire and
grab a couple of Coneys?

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:16.163
I can't. I'm going to
the zoo with Howard.

01:37:16.215 --> 01:37:18.131
Howard?

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:21.750
Mom says I can't call
him Bigfoot anymore.

01:37:28.174 --> 01:37:30.666
I think he's early.

01:37:47.507 --> 01:37:49.703
Teach you later?

01:37:51.257 --> 01:37:55.588
You gonna play "Jingle Bells"
the rest of your life?

01:39:10.757 --> 01:39:14.376
I have Tuesdays and Thursdays open.

01:39:15.216 --> 01:39:17.838
They're yours if you want them.

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:34.644
<i>Of days gone by</i>

01:39:38.444 --> 01:39:41.644
<i>In my solitude</i>

01:39:47.693 --> 01:39:49.893
<i>You taunt me</i>

01:39:51.548 --> 01:39:53.964
- Everything goes. That the idea?
- No...

01:39:53.965 --> 01:39:56.506
I'm just getting too
old for trophy dens.

01:39:56.507 --> 01:39:59.256
Anyway, it's a good
place for a workshop.

01:39:59.257 --> 01:40:01.454
Workshop?

01:40:01.924 --> 01:40:04.298
Yeah, workshop.

01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:07.964
Hammers and saws and...

01:40:07.965 --> 01:40:10.589
- ...things like that.
- Let's cut the bullshit.

01:40:10.590 --> 01:40:12.881
You came here to talk
business, right?

01:40:12.882 --> 01:40:14.964
We'll put the other
night behind us.

01:40:14.965 --> 01:40:19.129
In a couple of weeks, it'll be
the same. Now you can go.

01:40:21.924 --> 01:40:24.630
I'm not coming back, Frank.

01:40:29.216 --> 01:40:32.290
Then what's there to talk about?

01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:36.502
Frank.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:39.881
Listen.

01:40:39.882 --> 01:40:43.880
It's not you, understand? It's me.

01:40:50.174 --> 01:40:54.714
I sit in the fucking
Hilton or the Sheraton

01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.589
practically every night of my life.

01:40:56.590 --> 01:41:00.671
And the moment I get on stage,
I can't wait for it to end.

01:41:01.132 --> 01:41:06.043
We play the same songs the
same way every night.

01:41:06.424 --> 01:41:09.166
I just can't do it anymore.

01:41:11.257 --> 01:41:14.710
I've been lying to
myself long enough.

01:41:19.132 --> 01:41:21.755
You see anything you want, take it.

01:41:40.715 --> 01:41:43.125
Okay if I take this?

01:41:49.965 --> 01:41:52.956
Come on, Frank. I'm trying.

01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:57.881
How's your hand?

01:41:57.882 --> 01:42:01.631
My hand is fine.
Don't worry about me.

01:42:01.632 --> 01:42:04.539
I don't need this
any more than you.

01:42:04.882 --> 01:42:07.589
I can make just as much
teaching "Camptown Races"

01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:10.830
to snotty kids in the neighborhood.

01:42:13.257 --> 01:42:15.714
Don't fool yourself.

01:42:31.757 --> 01:42:33.835
Open it.

01:42:36.257 --> 01:42:39.129
Open the fucking bottle.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.756
Let's see what we got here.

01:42:46.757 --> 01:42:49.794
We got the airport Ramada.

01:42:51.257 --> 01:42:54.213
The Travel Lodge on 410.

01:42:54.715 --> 01:42:57.208
And we got...

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:00.256
the Mallory.

01:43:00.257 --> 01:43:01.964
I'll take the Mallory.

01:43:01.965 --> 01:43:05.536
Forget it. I want the Mallory.
You take the Travel Lodge.

01:43:33.465 --> 01:43:35.792
Not bad!

01:43:41.757 --> 01:43:44.381
When was the last time
we played the Mallory?

01:43:44.382 --> 01:43:47.172
'78, November.

01:43:47.799 --> 01:43:52.212
It was someone's birthday.
Hallorin?

01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:54.714
His daughter, sweet sixteen.

01:43:54.715 --> 01:43:56.839
How could I forget?

01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.714
What a nightmare.

01:43:58.715 --> 01:44:00.256
She asked for it.

01:44:00.257 --> 01:44:02.422
I told Howard we didn't
do vocals and he said:

01:44:02.423 --> 01:44:04.714
"What my Sissie wants,

01:44:04.715 --> 01:44:07.587
my Sissie gets".

01:44:13.507 --> 01:44:15.881
She got it alright.

01:44:22.977 --> 01:44:25.177
<i>She comes on like a dream</i>

01:44:25.476 --> 01:44:27.177
<i>All peaches and cream</i>

01:44:27.476 --> 01:44:30.177
<i>Lips like strawberry wine</i>

01:44:30.476 --> 01:44:32.475
<i>She's 16</i>

01:44:32.476 --> 01:44:33.976
<i>She's beautiful</i>

01:44:33.977 --> 01:44:36.177
<i>And she's mine</i>

01:44:37.977 --> 01:44:40.475
<i>You're all ribbons and curls</i>

01:44:40.476 --> 01:44:41.976
<i>Ooh, what a girl</i>

01:44:41.977 --> 01:44:44.976
<i>Eyes that sparkle and shine</i>

01:44:44.977 --> 01:44:46.976
<i>You're 16</i>

01:44:46.977 --> 01:44:48.475
<i>You're beautiful</i>

01:44:48.476 --> 01:44:51.177
<i>And you're mine</i>

01:44:52.476 --> 01:44:54.177
<i>You're 16</i>

01:44:54.476 --> 01:44:55.976
<i>You're beautiful</i>

01:44:55.977 --> 01:44:58.177
<i>And you're mine</i>

01:45:18.298 --> 01:45:21.171
You're risking your life.

01:45:21.799 --> 01:45:23.756
You got a gun?

01:45:23.757 --> 01:45:27.755
Car you're leaning on belongs to
a light heavyweight with attitude.

01:45:28.423 --> 01:45:30.917
I'll take my chances.

01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.454
You look good.

01:45:38.507 --> 01:45:41.130
You look like shit.

01:45:45.549 --> 01:45:48.207
No, I mean it. You look good.

01:45:50.465 --> 01:45:53.705
I mean it, too.
You look like shit.

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:58.290
So how's the cat food business?

01:46:00.132 --> 01:46:03.965
Terrific. I'm doing vegetables now.

01:46:05.173 --> 01:46:06.714
What kind?

01:46:06.715 --> 01:46:08.506
Carrots,

01:46:08.507 --> 01:46:10.751
peas.

01:46:11.674 --> 01:46:14.380
None of the important ones.

01:46:18.173 --> 01:46:20.548
You know...

01:46:20.882 --> 01:46:23.044
the other night...

01:46:23.049 --> 01:46:24.631
I was out of line.

01:46:24.632 --> 01:46:27.172
No, I was out of line.

01:46:33.298 --> 01:46:35.412
Well...

01:46:35.715 --> 01:46:38.872
I was kind of rough on Egghead.

01:46:40.674 --> 01:46:43.960
It beats the hell out of me,
but I kind of miss him.

01:46:43.966 --> 01:46:46.162
Well...

01:46:48.924 --> 01:46:53.041
he grows on you, after a while.

01:46:55.173 --> 01:46:57.964
So, did you find another girl?

01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:01.620
I didn't look.

01:47:08.382 --> 01:47:09.840
Well...

01:47:09.841 --> 01:47:12.214
I'm going to be late.

01:47:13.027 --> 01:47:14.525
<i>Peas, peas</i>

01:47:14.526 --> 01:47:16.026
<i>Try our peas</i>

01:47:16.298 --> 01:47:20.001
<i>Our peas are a delicacy.</i>

01:47:21.549 --> 01:47:24.297
From "Strangers in
the Night" to that.

01:47:24.298 --> 01:47:26.792
Funny world.

01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:34.798
Well... bye, Baker.

01:47:44.048 --> 01:47:46.458
Am I going to see you again?

01:47:46.674 --> 01:47:48.918
What do you think?

01:47:50.173 --> 01:47:52.047
Yeah,

01:47:52.048 --> 01:47:55.122
I think I am going
to see you again.

01:47:59.799 --> 01:48:02.125
Intuition.

01:48:13.143 --> 01:48:15.726
<i>Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm</i>

01:48:26.526 --> 01:48:30.227
<i>My funny Valentine</i>

01:48:33.027 --> 01:48:37.726
<i>Sweet comic Valentine</i>

01:48:41.027 --> 01:48:44.227
<i>You make me smile</i>

01:48:45.526 --> 01:48:47.726
<i>With my heart</i>

01:48:52.027 --> 01:48:54.726
<i>Hmm, hmm, hmm</i>

01:48:55.526 --> 01:49:01.227
<i>Your looks are laughable</i>

01:49:03.027 --> 01:49:06.726
<i>Unphotographable</i>

01:49:10.526 --> 01:49:17.726
<i>But you're my favorite work of art</i>

01:49:19.027 --> 01:49:23.026
<i>Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm</i>

01:49:23.027 --> 01:49:30.525
<i>Is your figure less than Greek</i>

01:49:30.526 --> 01:49:37.026
<i>Is your mouth a little weak</i>

01:49:37.027 --> 01:49:44.525
<i>When you open it to speak</i>

01:49:44.526 --> 01:49:49.726
<i>Are you smart</i>

01:49:57.027 --> 01:50:00.726
<i>Don't change a hair for me</i>

01:50:05.526 --> 01:50:11.026
<i>Not if you care for me</i>

01:50:11.027 --> 01:50:18.525
<i>Stay, my funny Valentine</i>

01:50:18.526 --> 01:50:25.227
<i>Stay</i>

01:50:29.526 --> 01:50:34.726
<i>Each day is Valentine's...</i>

01:50:37.476 --> 01:50:40.177
<i>Day</i>

01:50:41.305 --> 01:50:47.577
