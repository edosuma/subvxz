07:38.500 --> 07:39.959

I MEAN, THERE'S YOUR BEDDING,
AND THERE'S MY BEDDING,

IT WOULD BE NICE

08:08.333 --> 08:10.333

OUR BEDDING.

08:10.375 --> 08:11.542

08:11.583 --> 08:13.041
YEAH. ACTUALLY, NO.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.417

SO JUST CHOOSE.

08:24.583 --> 08:25.792
FINE.

08:25.834 --> 08:27.291
UH... (blows air)

08:27.333 --> 08:28.709
GREEN.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.792
CAN'T YOU BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT?

08:30.834 --> 08:32.417
I'M SORRY. I JUST--
WOULD YOU LEAVE ME

08:32.458 --> 08:34.041
THE MINUTE I HAVE A BABY
IF I HAD A BRAIN INJURY?

08:34.083 --> 08:37.041
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR BRAIN?

08:37.083 --> 08:39.583
NO, NOT MY BRAIN.
MY PATIENT'S BRAIN.

08:39.625 --> 08:40.709
I'M FIXATED.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.375
WAIT. DID YOU JUST ASK ME
IF I WAS GONNA LEAVE YOU

08:42.417 --> 08:43.834
WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR BABY?

08:43.875 --> 08:46.166
NO, SAM. I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT US.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.667
I WAS--I AM...

08:47.709 --> 08:49.625
WORRIED ABOUT MY PATIENT.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.875
OKAY?

08:50.917 --> 08:53.000
BY THE WAY,
I'M NOT EVEN PREGNANT, SO...

08:53.041 --> 08:55.041
WELL, WAS THAT
A-A POSSIBILITY,

08:55.083 --> 08:56.625
YOU BEING PREGNANT?

08:56.667 --> 08:58.000
NO. I HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.208
STARTED...

08:59.250 --> 09:00.875
FERTILITY DRUGS.
RIGHT.

09:00.917 --> 09:03.250
WHATEVER. YOU KNOW, I WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT US, SO...

09:03.291 --> 09:05.583
OKAY. OKAY.

09:05.625 --> 09:08.417
UH, ADDISON...

09:08.458 --> 09:11.041
ARE YOU--ARE YOU WORRIED,
UH, THAT I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU--

09:11.083 --> 09:12.750
NO. SAM, COME ON.

09:12.792 --> 09:14.792
I CHOSE. GREEN.

09:14.834 --> 09:16.250
GET OUT.

09:16.291 --> 09:18.500
(whispers) OKAY.

09:18.542 --> 09:21.208
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

09:21.250 --> 09:23.250
OKAY, I AM GONNA
TELL YOU SOMETHING

09:23.291 --> 09:25.250
THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL
TO MAKE YOU ANGRY.

09:25.291 --> 09:26.583
BUT IT--IT--IT SHOULDN'T.

09:26.625 --> 09:27.917
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND
WHY IT COULD,

09:27.959 --> 09:29.875
BUT IT--IT COULD ALSO
BE GREAT, AMAZING.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.417
AND I REALIZE IT'S GONNA
CHANGE THINGS--
JUST SAY IT ALREADY.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.041
I HAVE A SON.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.208
MASON. HE'S 8.

09:37.250 --> 09:39.583
UH...
THERE WAS THIS WOMAN,

09:39.625 --> 09:42.792
AND WE WERE TOGETHER
NINE YEARS AGO.

09:42.834 --> 09:44.709
AND IT WAS--
IT WAS ONE NIGHT, AND--

09:44.750 --> 09:46.041
AND SHE GOT PREGNANT.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.458
UH, HER NAME
IS ERICA WARNER.

09:49.500 --> 09:51.750
Y-YOU WERE ONLY TOGETHER
ONE NIGHT,

09:51.792 --> 09:54.709
AND YOU TRUST THIS ERICA
BECAUSE...

09:54.750 --> 09:57.917
THE MINUTE I SAW HIM,
I KNEW.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.625
I MEAN...

09:59.667 --> 10:02.333
HE'S A MINI COOPER.
(chuckles)

10:02.375 --> 10:04.458
DID YOU TAKE
A PATERNITY TEST?

10:04.500 --> 10:06.417
UH...

10:06.458 --> 10:08.458
A WOMAN SHOWS UP,

10:08.500 --> 10:10.959
TELLS YOU YOU'RE THE FATHER
OF HER 8-YEAR-OLD CHILD,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.458
AND YOU JUST
TAKE HER WORD FOR IT?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.667
COOPER...

10:15.709 --> 10:17.083
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

10:18.709 --> 10:20.625
I MARRIED AN IDIOT.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.667
HEY, I WAS JUST COMING
TO TALK TO YOU.

10:28.709 --> 10:29.959
AND SOMEHOW I ANTICIPATED THAT
AND DECIDED TO LEAVE.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.166
SHELDON,
I RESENT THE IMPLICATION--

10:32.208 --> 10:33.542
THE VERY PUBLIC IMPLICATION--

10:33.583 --> 10:35.041
THAT I CANNOT BE IMPARTIAL
WITH MY PATIENTS.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.041
I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.125
I AM SORRY.
THAT WAS RUDE OF ME.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.250
BUT SINCE
WE'RE BEING REASONABLE,

10:39.291 --> 10:41.250
WHY DON'T WE DISCUSS
THE PUBLIC IMPLICATION

10:41.291 --> 10:42.792
THAT I WOULD ASSERT
TO MY PATIENT

10:42.834 --> 10:45.375
WHAT HE SHOULD OR SHOULDN'T DO
WITH REGARD TO HIS MARRIAGE?

10:45.417 --> 10:47.542
FINE. I AM SORRY.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.041
THANK YOU.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.542
JUST ONE MORE THING.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.250
DID YOU EVEN ENTERTAIN THE IDEA

10:52.291 --> 10:54.166
THAT ZACH COULD TALK TO YOU
ABOUT LEAVING JODI

10:54.208 --> 10:56.792
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
FOR HIM TO TALK TO A MAN?

10:56.834 --> 10:58.542
VIOLET, I DON'T WANT
TO DISCUSS THIS WITH YOU.

10:58.583 --> 11:00.417
BUT I KNEW
ZACH AND JODI BEFORE.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.208
THEY--THEY CAME TO ME
FOR INFERTILITY,

11:02.250 --> 11:04.000
WHICH, AS YOU KNOW,
CAN DESTROY A COUPLE.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.750
BUT THEY NEVER BLAMED
ONE ANOTHER,

11:05.792 --> 11:07.083
THE NEVER GAVE UP
ON ONE ANOTHER.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.083
THEY WERE REALLY,
TRULY IN LOVE.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.792
AND YOU NEVER GOT
TO SEE THAT.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.500
I READ YOUR NOTES, VIOLET,
YOUR VERY SPARSE NOTES.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.041
SO THAT'S ALL I HAD TO GO ON.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.041
I'M UPDATING MY NOTES,
SHELDON.

11:17.083 --> 11:19.625
WELL, THAT'S HELPFUL. LATE,
BUT HELPFUL. SO THANK YOU.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.041
WELL, HOW THE HELL WAS I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW

11:21.083 --> 11:22.041
YOU WERE GONNA TAKE OVER
MY PATIENTS?

11:22.083 --> 11:23.208
YOU JUST GOTTA
KEEP ON WALKING, SHELDON.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.750
EXCUSE ME?
PETE--

11:24.792 --> 11:26.625
I'M SAYING, SHE'S LIKE
A DOG WITH A BONE.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.208
SHE WON'T STOP,
SO AT SOME POINT,

11:28.250 --> 11:30.041
YOU JUST GOTTA KEEP ON WALKING.

11:31.625 --> 11:34.041
ARE YOU OKAY?

11:34.083 --> 11:36.041
UH, HE'S IN ANGER.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.333
IT'S A, UH...

11:37.375 --> 11:40.208
IT'S A NECESSARY PHASE.
HE'LL MOVE THROUGH IT.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.041
IT CAN'T BE EASY,
BEING THE TARGET, THOUGH.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.000
I...

11:46.083 --> 11:49.041
ZACH'S FEELINGS ARE--
ARE CYCLICAL, SHELDON.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.041
HE DOES NOT WANT TO LEAVE.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.041
VIOLET...

11:52.083 --> 11:53.750
PERHAPS I WASN'T CLEAR.

11:53.792 --> 11:55.750
AS LONG AS YOUR LICENSE
IS SUSPENDED,

11:55.792 --> 11:57.667
ZACH IS NOT YOUR PATIENT.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.250
HE'S MINE.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.041
(files thud)

12:11.083 --> 12:12.500
(Sheldon laughs)

12:12.542 --> 12:13.834
YEAH, RIGHT.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.041
YEAH.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.291
SO IMAGINE
THIS SCENARIO--

12:16.333 --> 12:18.417
A WOMAN SHOWS UP
OUT OF NOWHERE

12:18.458 --> 12:21.250
AND TELLS A GUY THAT
HE'S GOT AN 8-YEAR-OLD SON.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.583
OOH.

12:22.625 --> 12:24.083
WHEN JODI GOES INTO LABOR,

12:24.125 --> 12:26.041
WHAT RISK DOES HER
BRAIN INJURY POSE?

12:26.083 --> 12:27.500
MM. FLUID MAY BUILD UP
DURING DELIVERY,

12:27.542 --> 12:29.875
INCREASING THE PRESSURE
IN HER BRAIN.
(cell phone buzzes)

12:29.917 --> 12:31.875
(cell phone chimes)
IF YOU'RE ASKING, I SHOULD
BE IN THERE WITH YOU.

12:31.917 --> 12:33.834
WHAT--COOPER HAS A KID?

12:33.875 --> 12:35.500
WHAT?

12:35.542 --> 12:38.041
NO.
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

12:38.083 --> 12:39.417
SAM TEXTED ME.
MINE'S FROM SHELDON.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.041
(exhales deeply)
COOPER AND HIS BIG MOUTH.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.083
(Violet) OH, MY GOD.
DID YOU HEAR?

12:42.125 --> 12:43.250
(Addison) YEAH.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.625
OH, COOPER'S GONNA BE
A GREAT DAD.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.875
THAT IS A STUPID THING
TO SAY.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.875
MASON IS THIS KID'S NAME,

12:48.917 --> 12:50.041
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS

12:50.083 --> 12:54.250
THAT HE WANTED
TO MEET HIS, UH... ME.

12:54.291 --> 12:56.083
I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE HE'S
THE ONLY ONE SHE SLEPT WITH?

12:56.125 --> 12:57.625
SO HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK?

12:57.667 --> 12:59.083
SHE PROBABLY JUST
LOOKED UP THE GUY SHE SCREWED,

12:59.125 --> 13:02.041
SAW THAT COOPER WAS A DOCTOR,
AND BINGO--NAMES HIM DADDY.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.083
COOPER'S A SUCKER.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.041
WOULD IT REALLY KILL YOU
TO BE ITS OTHER MOMMY?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.041
MIGHT KILL THE KID.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.250
EVERYBODY JUST
SLOW THE HELL DOWN.

13:08.291 --> 13:10.166
WE DON'T EVEN REALLY KNOW
IF THIS IS COOPER'S CHILD.

13:10.208 --> 13:11.166
(Pete) PATERNITY TEST.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.083
OKAY?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.959
OH, I KNOW, BUT, YOU GUYS,
THIS KID--

13:14.000 --> 13:15.750
HE'S GOT MY HAIR,
HE'S GOT MY EYES,

13:15.792 --> 13:17.041
HE'S GOT MY SENSE OF HUMOR.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.792
IT'S--
YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'D LIE TO HIM?

13:18.834 --> 13:20.041
(Sam) YEAH,
SHE'D LIE TO HIM.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.166
AND THE OTHER THING IS...

13:22.208 --> 13:24.083
SHE NEVER FORGOT MY NAME.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.375
(laughs)

13:25.417 --> 13:27.125
WE DID IT ONCE, NINE YEARS AGO,
BACK OF HER CAR.

13:27.166 --> 13:29.500
ONCE, AND SHE REMEMBERS ME.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.750
THAT'S GOTTA SAY SOMETHING.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.041
I'M JUST SAYING.

13:35.542 --> 13:37.041
(exhales)

13:37.083 --> 13:38.250
WHAT?

13:38.291 --> 13:40.041
EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:40.083 --> 13:43.208
IT'S GREAT.
EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

13:43.250 --> 13:46.083
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:46.125 --> 13:49.375
UH, I KNOW IT'S NONE OF
MY BUSINESS, BUT...

13:49.417 --> 13:51.041
I GET IT.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.583
THERE'S THIS KID
THAT YOU WISH WOULD DISAPPEAR,

13:53.625 --> 13:55.500
AND THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GUILTY,

13:55.542 --> 13:58.208
AND WORSE, HE COULD END UP
BEING A PART OF YOUR LIFE

13:58.250 --> 14:01.041
EVEN THOUGH HE'S NOT YOURS

14:01.083 --> 14:04.083
AND YOU DIDN'T ASK FOR HIM.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.166
YOU DO HAVE A CHOICE,
YOU KNOW?

14:06.208 --> 14:07.750
(paper thuds)

14:07.792 --> 14:09.041
I MADE MY CHOICE, SAM,

14:09.083 --> 14:11.208
MONTHS AGO.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.041
I CHOSE COOPER.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.834
THAT MEANS
TAKING WHATEVER COMES

14:14.875 --> 14:16.625
TOGETHER...

14:16.667 --> 14:18.333
UNFORTUNATELY.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.500
LET'S SEE. TIME OF DEATH--

16:20.542 --> 16:23.291
ALL RIGHT. GO. THANK YOU.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.291
(laughs)

16:24.333 --> 16:26.250
(laughs)

16:26.291 --> 16:28.709
OH.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.041
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:30.083 --> 16:31.041
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE THAT.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.291
WE WERE JUST...

16:32.333 --> 16:35.041
FORGET IT.

16:35.083 --> 16:36.500
SO I'M ABOUT TO OVERSTEP.

16:36.542 --> 16:38.041
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY

16:38.083 --> 16:40.917
FOR TRYING TO COMPARTMENTALIZE
HAVING A BABY

16:40.959 --> 16:42.125
AND A RELATIONSHIP WITH SAM.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.166
N-NO. I WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT ZACH AND JODI.

16:44.208 --> 16:46.083
OH.

16:46.125 --> 16:48.583
SO ZACH IS MAKING
A MISTAKE,

16:48.625 --> 16:50.792
AND I WOULD TELL HIM THAT

16:50.834 --> 16:52.792
IF THE LAW DIDN'T PROHIBIT ME
FROM SPEAKING TO HIM,

16:52.834 --> 16:56.750
AND SHELDON'S NOT GONNA TELL HIM
THAT HE'S DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.208
OH. YOU WANT ME...

17:02.250 --> 17:04.250
TO CONVINCE ZACH

17:04.291 --> 17:06.000
TO STAY WITH JODI?

17:10.166 --> 17:11.250
(pours liquid)

17:11.291 --> 17:13.834
I USED TO MAKE FUN
OF JODI AND HER LISTS.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.041
(glass clatters)

17:15.083 --> 17:16.333
EVEN BEFORE THE ACCIDENT,

17:16.375 --> 17:19.041
THERE WAS A PAD
IN EVERY ROOM.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.834
NOW THE POST-ITS ARE...
HELPFUL.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.125
AND SO ARE YOU.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.458
BEING HERE FOR HER,
LOVING HER--

17:25.500 --> 17:27.375
IT HELPS.

17:27.417 --> 17:29.417
ZACH, IS THERE...

17:29.458 --> 17:32.166
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LEAVE COMPLETELY?

17:32.208 --> 17:34.041
I DIDN'T SIGN UP
FOR THIS.

17:34.083 --> 17:35.375
YEAH, BUT ISN'T THAT
THE POINT?

17:35.417 --> 17:37.500
WE SIGN UP, WE NEVER KNOW

17:37.542 --> 17:39.583
WHAT WE'RE GONNA GET,
BUT YOU...

17:39.625 --> 17:41.917
YOU STAY, YOU STICK IT OUT.

17:41.959 --> 17:45.166
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT STAYING LOOKS LIKE?

17:45.208 --> 17:47.041
JODI...

17:47.083 --> 17:49.250
HONEY, YOU'RE PREGNANT.

17:49.291 --> 17:51.041
WHAT?
THAT'S AMAZING.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.208
YEAH.

17:52.250 --> 17:55.041
BUT I'M LEAVING YOU,

17:55.083 --> 17:57.166
AND I'M TAKING THE BABY.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.041
Y-YOU CAN'T.
I-I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.041
AND THE BABY, OUR--
ZACH.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.041
MY BABY...
THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.041
DR. MONTGOMERY, EVERY DAY,

18:06.083 --> 18:08.041
OVER AND OVER.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.333
JODI.

18:09.375 --> 18:11.291
HMM?
HONEY, YOU'RE PREGNANT.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.750
(laughs)

18:12.792 --> 18:14.875
BUT I'M TAKING THE BABY
AND I'M LEAVING YOU.

18:14.917 --> 18:15.875
ALL RIGHT, ZACH,
STOP IT.

18:15.917 --> 18:17.083
THIS IS MY LIFE.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.917
AND I HATE MYSELF.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.917
I-I HATE WHO I'VE BECOME,
BECAUSE LIVING LIKE THIS

18:20.959 --> 18:22.125
HAS MADE ME HATE HER.

18:22.166 --> 18:25.208
MY WIFE HAS BECOME
MY CHILD.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.250
DOESN'T THAT CHANGE
THE RULES?

18:27.291 --> 18:28.667
I WANT OUR KID TO HAVE
A NORMAL LIFE,

18:28.709 --> 18:31.041
AND HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE
WITH JODI...

18:31.083 --> 18:33.041
(sighs) I CAN'T
TAKE CARE OF THEM BOTH.

18:33.083 --> 18:35.041
I JUST... I CAN'T.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.041
(Addison) OKAY, LOOK,
SOMEWHERE...

18:37.083 --> 18:39.542
INSIDE OF THERE
IS THE WOMAN THAT YOU LOVE.

18:39.583 --> 18:43.041
I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO STOP.
YOU'RE HURTING HER.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.250
WHY? SHE WON'T REMEMBER.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.166
(Jodi) ZACH, I...

18:46.208 --> 18:49.875
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.250
JODI, YOU'RE OKAY.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.709
(Jodi) WHO ARE YOU?

18:53.750 --> 18:56.583
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY,
AND YOU'RE HAVING A BABY.

18:56.625 --> 18:58.166
(Addison speaks indistinctly)

18:58.208 --> 19:00.834
(mutters)

19:04.333 --> 19:05.458
NO!

19:05.500 --> 19:06.875
(crying) WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING TO ME?

19:06.917 --> 19:08.959
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY, JODI.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER

19:09.000 --> 19:09.917
BECAUSE YOU WERE
IN AN ACCIDENT.

19:09.959 --> 19:11.041
PULSE PRESSURE'S WIDENING.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.709
WHERE'S ZACH?

19:12.750 --> 19:15.750
I NEED ZACH. DR. TURNER,
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND?

19:15.792 --> 19:17.000
ZACH WILL BE HERE
VERY SOON.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.917
IT HURTS.
WHY DOES IT HURT?

19:19.959 --> 19:23.208
YOU ARE HAVING...
A BABY.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.041
(pants) WHO ARE YOU?

19:25.083 --> 19:27.583
THAT'S DR. MONTGOMERY.
SHE'S GONNA DELIVER YOUR BABY.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.542
WHAT BABY? WHERE'S ZACH?

19:29.583 --> 19:30.792
JODI, I NEED YOU TO PUSH.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.500
AH! I CAN'T. IT--IT HURTS.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.959
NO. I'M--I'M SCARED.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.750
HER HEART RATE'S DROPPING.
IT'S A CUSHION REFLEX.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.166
IT'S A SIGN THAT THERE'S
A CRITICAL RISE IN HER I.C.P.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.834
I WANT ZACH! (sobs)

19:41.875 --> 19:43.709
(monitor beeping rapidly)

19:43.750 --> 19:45.500
HE CAME TO THE HOSPITAL.
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE.

19:45.542 --> 19:46.750
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

19:46.792 --> 19:48.041
YES, I TRIED.
BUT HE'S MADE UP HIS MIND.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.834
OH, THIS IS SHELDON'S FAULT.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.041
I'M SURE HE WAS TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:52.083 --> 19:54.041
I AM LEGALLY BLOCKED
FROM TALKING TO ZACH,

19:54.083 --> 19:55.667
BUT YOU CAN TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

19:55.709 --> 19:57.667
AND--AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT
YOU NOT BEING A THERAPIST IS,

19:57.709 --> 19:59.208
YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANT.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.875
YOU--YOU CAN YELL AT HIM,
YOU CAN SHAME HIM,

20:00.917 --> 20:02.250
YOU--YOU CAN--YOU CAN SAY
E-EVERY MESSED UP THING

20:02.291 --> 20:04.250
THAT YOU EVER WANTED TO SAY
TO ANY GUY WHO ABANDONED YOU

20:04.291 --> 20:07.041
OR DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR YOU,
BUT GET HIM BACK IN HERE,

20:07.083 --> 20:09.041
BECAUSE HIS WIFE
NEEDS HIM, NOW.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.458
(beeping continues)

20:10.500 --> 20:12.041
I'LL GET IT. OKAY, JODI.
(crying)

20:12.083 --> 20:14.166
CAN YOU BREATHE?
CAN YOU LOOK AT ME?
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.792
(indistinct conversations)

20:16.834 --> 20:18.041
HEY.
HEY.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.041
SO, UM, HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE,

20:20.083 --> 20:21.875
AND I'M NOT READY
FOR HIM TO KNOW,

20:21.917 --> 20:23.291
SO YOU TAKE IT SLOW?

20:23.333 --> 20:24.709
I-I WILL.

20:24.750 --> 20:26.041
YOU'RE JUST THE DOCTOR,
RIGHT?

20:26.083 --> 20:27.166
(Cooper) YEAH.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.583
HEY, LOOK WHO I FOUND.

20:28.625 --> 20:29.709
DR. FREEDMAN.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.291
(laughs)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:31.333 --> 20:33.709
I GET JUNK FOOD 'CAUSE I
LET YOU TAKE MY BLOOD.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.834
WELL, YOU DIDN'T
REALLY LET ME, BUT OKAY.

20:36.875 --> 20:37.834
SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

20:37.875 --> 20:39.041
I LOVE JUNK FOOD.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.667
SEE, MOM, HE EATS IT
AND HE'S A DOCTOR.

20:41.709 --> 20:43.166
YEAH, I'M SURE
HE DOESN'T DO IT OFTEN.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.834
NO, NO, YOUR MOM'S RIGHT.
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.583
AND I-I DON'T COME HERE
ALL THE TIME.

20:46.625 --> 20:47.709
JUST TO CELEBRATE.

20:47.750 --> 20:48.917
AND, UH,

20:48.959 --> 20:51.000
DON'T TELL
MY OTHER PATIENTS, OKAY?

20:51.041 --> 20:53.041
SO WHAT FLAVORS
DID YOU GET?

20:53.083 --> 20:55.417
OH, I GOT VANILLA,
CHOCOLATE, AND STRAWBERRY.

20:55.458 --> 20:56.625
CAN I HAVE THE STRAWBERRY?

20:56.667 --> 20:59.041
STRAWBERRY'S
MY FAVORITE, TOO.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.333
(indistinct conversations
continue)

21:11.125 --> 21:14.542
(people speaking indistinctly)

21:14.583 --> 21:16.083
(clears throat)

21:18.500 --> 21:20.625
Y-YOU'RE NEVER
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.250
YOU HAVE ANOTHER KID.

21:23.792 --> 21:25.750
YOU KNOW HOW I DIP MY FRIES
IN MY SHAKE,

21:25.792 --> 21:27.291
AND IT DRIVES YOU CRAZY?

21:27.333 --> 21:29.875
MASON DIPPED HIS FRY, SAME WAY,
EXCEPT HERE'S THE THING--

21:29.917 --> 21:31.166
IT WASN'T JUST ANY SHAKE.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.250
I BOUGHT
ALL THREE MAJOR FLAVORS.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.333
AND DO YOU KNOW
WHICH ONE HE PICKED?

21:35.375 --> 21:36.333
DO YOU?

21:36.375 --> 21:38.542
STRAWBERRY.

21:38.583 --> 21:40.709
WHAT KID DOESN'T PICK
CHOCOLATE OR VANILLA?!

21:40.750 --> 21:42.000
D--

21:44.375 --> 21:46.792
MY KID. THAT'S WHO.

21:46.834 --> 21:49.500
I MEAN, HE'S SO MY KID.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.542
I'M GONNA GO
TO THE TOY STORE LATER.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.542
ERICA SAID MASON
DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF TOYS.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.500
I DON'T THINK...

21:55.542 --> 21:57.500
THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY,
REALLY.

21:57.542 --> 21:58.792
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:58.834 --> 22:00.917
WHATEVER YOU THINK,
COOP.

22:02.625 --> 22:06.041
(laughs)

22:06.083 --> 22:07.625
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

22:07.667 --> 22:09.542
(Jodi screams)

22:09.583 --> 22:12.041
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?

22:12.083 --> 22:14.333
JODI'S IN LABOR.
SHE'S SCARED AND CONFUSED.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.041
YOU THINK
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THAT?

22:16.083 --> 22:18.041
THE BABY IS COMING NOW,
ZACH.

22:18.083 --> 22:21.500
AND JODI, THE UNLUCKY ONE
WHO SUFFERED THE BRAIN INJURY

22:21.542 --> 22:23.125
AND HAS CARRIED YOUR CHILD
FOR THE LAST NINE MONTHS,

22:23.166 --> 22:24.917
IS ABOUT TO DELIVER.

22:24.959 --> 22:27.417
AND SHE'S NOT GONNA UNDERSTAND,
ZACH, WHY IT FEELS LIKE

22:27.458 --> 22:29.417
HER INSIDES
ARE BEING TORN APART.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.917
SHE'S GONNA BE

22:30.959 --> 22:33.000
EVEN MORE PETRIFIED
AND CONFUSED AND ALONE.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.333
SHE'S NOT ALONE.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.375
YOU'LL BE THERE,
AND DR. TURNER WILL BE THERE.

22:36.417 --> 22:37.750
NO, DON'T, ZACH.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.250
SHE IS ALONE, OKAY?

22:39.291 --> 22:41.875
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL COULD BE
THERE, AND SHE'D STILL BE ALONE,

22:41.917 --> 22:43.875
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO CAN MAKE HER NOT FEEL ALONE.

22:43.917 --> 22:46.417
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON WHO CAN
CALM HER DOWN, AND THAT IS YOU.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.458
SO IF YOU EVER LOVED JODI,

22:48.500 --> 22:49.875
FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS,

22:49.917 --> 22:51.875
BE THE MAN
YOU PROMISED HER TO BE.

22:51.917 --> 22:53.959
BE THERE FOR HER.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.583
ALL RIGHT, AND THEN--
THEN YOU CAN GO.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.875
(Jodi screams)

23:06.709 --> 23:09.709
(indistinct conversations)

23:19.083 --> 23:21.208
YOU ASKED ME TO COME.

23:21.250 --> 23:23.834
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

23:23.875 --> 23:25.583
WELL, YOU CAN START
BY EXPLAINING

23:25.625 --> 23:27.417
WHY YOU DIDN'T TELL COOPER
ABOUT MASON.

23:29.959 --> 23:32.417
I WAS YOUNG.
I LIKED TO PARTY.

23:32.458 --> 23:34.583
I WAS TENDING BAR,
AND WE DID IT IN MY CAR.

23:34.625 --> 23:36.583
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS BAD,
BUT--

23:36.625 --> 23:39.917
YOU THINK COOPER
WAS MY FIRST?

23:39.959 --> 23:43.083
WELL, A MONTH OR SO LATER,
I REALIZED I WAS PREGNANT.

23:43.125 --> 23:46.041
AND I THOUGHT ABOUT CALLING.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.041
BUT I WAS SCARED.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.083
WELL, SOMEHOW GETTING KNOCKED
UP'S ALWAYS A WOMAN'S FAULT.

23:50.125 --> 23:52.041
RIGHT.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.041
AND IF I DID CALL,
AND HE WASN'T THAT GUY,

23:54.083 --> 23:57.417
THEN WE WOULD'VE BEEN STUCK
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES, AND...

23:57.458 --> 23:59.041
SO WHY SHOW UP NOW?

24:01.250 --> 24:03.041
I'M HERE FOR MY SON,

24:03.083 --> 24:04.834
NOT FOR ME.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.041
(indistinct conversations
continue)

24:06.083 --> 24:08.000
(exhales)

24:09.083 --> 24:10.417
HOW MUCH?

24:10.458 --> 24:12.750
WHAT?

24:12.792 --> 24:14.750
YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR SON.

24:14.792 --> 24:17.792
I'M PROTECTING MY HUSBAND.

24:17.834 --> 24:19.917
20 GRAND SHOULD GO
A LONG WAY.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.917
YOU RUN OUT, LET ME KNOW.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.333
OTHERWISE...

24:23.375 --> 24:25.917
STAY THE HELL
AWAY FROM US.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.542
A MALE FRIEND.

36:09.583 --> 36:11.917
OKAY.

36:11.959 --> 36:14.041

36:14.083 --> 36:16.583

YOU COULD GIVE ME A...

36:21.542 --> 36:23.041

36:23.083 --> 36:26.750
BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND
THE FEMALE PART OF IT, TOO.

36:26.792 --> 36:29.000
AM I MAKING ANY SENSE?

36:29.041 --> 36:30.375
SORT OF. (laughs)

36:30.417 --> 36:32.208
DO YOU WANT TO JUST
ASK ME THE QUESTION?

36:32.250 --> 36:33.750
YES, I DO.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.542
NO, I-I DO, BUT...

36:36.583 --> 36:38.041
I WANT TO SAY THINGS TO YOU

36:38.083 --> 36:40.166
THAT I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID
TO SAM,

36:40.208 --> 36:42.458
AND THAT FEELS
A LITTLE WEIRD

36:42.500 --> 36:45.041
BECAUSE...

36:45.083 --> 36:47.041
I-I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

36:47.083 --> 36:49.041
WELL, IF IT MAKES IT
ANY EASIER,

36:49.083 --> 36:50.875
YOU CAN--
YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING.

36:53.083 --> 36:56.000
OR I CAN JUST TELL YOU.

36:57.041 --> 37:00.041
I AM THE OLDEST OF FOUR,
THREE SISTERS.

37:00.083 --> 37:04.333
FATHER LEFT WHEN I WAS 9.
MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS 18.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.000
COLLEGE HAD TO WAIT

37:06.041 --> 37:08.875
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO SPLIT UP MY FAMILY.

37:08.917 --> 37:11.500
SO I WORKED THREE JOBS--
BIKE COURIER, BELLMAN,

37:11.542 --> 37:13.583
SHORT-ORDER COOK.

37:13.625 --> 37:16.041
AT ONE POINT,
I EVEN SOLD MY SPERM.

37:16.083 --> 37:18.041
PROBABLY NOT A GENIUS MOVE,

37:18.083 --> 37:20.041
GIVEN COOPER'S
CURRENT PREDICAMENT,

37:20.083 --> 37:22.083
BUT I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

37:22.125 --> 37:25.000
I HAD A FREE RIDE TO COLLEGE,
PUT MYSELF THROUGH MED SCHOOL.

37:25.041 --> 37:27.458
