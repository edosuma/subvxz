Both good.
The important thing is
I'm meeting new people.

15:20.481 --> 15:22.517
Bushwah!
Now, what's your mission?

15:22.586 --> 15:25.206
Are you planning to make
some kind of alien-human hybrid?

15:25.274 --> 15:29.102
Are you coming on to me?Hot crackers!
I take exception to that!

15:29.172 --> 15:31.136
I'm not hearing a "no."

15:31.206 --> 15:33.965
Nerts to this space crab!
If we want information,

15:34.033 --> 15:36.274
we'll have to do us
an old-fashioned alien autopsy.

15:37.344 --> 15:39.172
Hooray!

15:45.447 --> 15:49.102
Every little thing
reminds me of Enos.

15:49.172 --> 15:50.931
[ Sobbing ]

15:51.000 --> 15:53.654
Aw. I know how you feel.

15:53.724 --> 15:56.172
My grandfather died recently.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.620
It's all so sad.

16:00.688 --> 16:05.136
At times like this,
I just need someone
to hold me.

16:05.206 --> 16:09.000
Mmm.
You like holdin' me,
don't you?

16:09.067 --> 16:11.033
Hey, you know what
always cheers you up?

16:11.102 --> 16:13.240
Baking me a nice tray
of sugar cookies.

16:13.309 --> 16:16.000
How about these cookies,
sugar?

16:16.067 --> 16:18.033
[ Gasps ]
I shouldn't be here. [ Glass Shatters ]

16:18.102 --> 16:21.067
I shouldn't even exist.
But I do exist,

16:21.136 --> 16:24.620
which proves you can't really
be my grandm--

16:24.688 --> 16:26.724
Mmm!

16:26.793 --> 16:28.793
[ Both Moaning ]

16:38.206 --> 16:40.620
[ Snoring ]

16:42.688 --> 16:45.758
[ Farnsworth,
Leela Groaning ]Oh, my God!

16:46.688 --> 16:48.620
Huh?

16:50.724 --> 16:53.793
What the hell
have you done, Fry?Relax.

16:53.861 --> 16:56.551
She can't be my grandmother.
I figured it all out.

16:56.620 --> 16:59.895
Of course
she's your grandmother,
you perverted dope!

16:59.965 --> 17:04.275
- Look!
- Come back to bed, dearie.

17:04.344 --> 17:06.275
[ Screams ]
It's impossible!

17:06.344 --> 17:09.378
I mean,
if she's my grandmother,
who's my grandfather?

17:09.448 --> 17:12.240
Isn't it obvious?

17:12.309 --> 17:16.103
- You are.
- [ Screams ]

17:16.172 --> 17:19.517
[ Screaming Continues ]

17:19.586 --> 17:23.517
Did you say something, dearie?
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.931
[ Screaming Intensifies ]

17:30.964 --> 17:33.723
Commencing excavation
of the subject's chest cavity.

17:33.792 --> 17:36.792
And in this corner,
Zoidberg!

17:36.862 --> 17:39.517
[ Chuckling ]
Come on, lighten up.

17:39.586 --> 17:41.895
What is this, a funeral?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.240
Heart.Take.
I've got four of them.

17:46.309 --> 17:48.619
Stomach contents:
one deviled egg.

17:48.689 --> 17:51.964
Deviled egg?
[ Loud Slurping ]

17:52.034 --> 17:53.964
The same deviled egg.

17:55.619 --> 17:58.586
[ Sobbing ]

17:58.654 --> 18:01.103
Snap out of it!Start the ship, Leela.

18:01.172 --> 18:05.000
Let's just steal
the damn radar dish and
get back to our own time.

18:05.067 --> 18:07.000
But-But won't that
change history?

18:07.067 --> 18:09.895
Oh, a lesson
in not changing history...

18:09.964 --> 18:12.344
from Mr. "I'm My Own Grandpa."

18:12.413 --> 18:15.792
Let's get the hell
out of here already!
Screw history!

18:34.205 --> 18:35.723
[ Screaming ]

18:37.517 --> 18:40.136
U.F.O.! U.F.O.!

18:42.895 --> 18:45.723
[ Ticking ]

18:45.792 --> 18:48.931
Hey, don't cut that.
I need that to speak.

18:50.481 --> 18:52.378
[ Crash ][ Gasps ]

18:54.275 --> 18:56.205
Oh, my--Great Roosevelt's ghost!

18:56.275 --> 18:58.654
[ Karate Grunts ]

18:58.723 --> 19:00.689
[ Grunts Continue ][ Groans ]

19:02.103 --> 19:04.413
Take this,
Mr. President, sir! [ Gasps ]

19:04.481 --> 19:07.826
[ Gasps, Groans ]

19:07.895 --> 19:10.826
The president is gagging
on my gas bladder.

19:10.895 --> 19:12.931
What an honor.

19:15.586 --> 19:17.481
[ Snoring ]
Wha--

19:17.550 --> 19:19.826
Oh, right.

19:35.758 --> 19:39.172
Enos! [ Fry ] He's dead! Sorry!

19:59.275 --> 20:01.550
[ All Cheering ]

20:01.619 --> 20:03.826
Choke on that, causality!

20:03.895 --> 20:08.034
1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
[ Yelling ]

20:13.000 --> 20:15.309
Turn around! We've gotta go back for Bender!

20:15.378 --> 20:18.931
Impossible!
The supernova time hole
is closing.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.205
If we don't leave now,
we'll never get back
to the 31st century.

20:25.550 --> 20:28.826
Whoa!

20:31.550 --> 20:35.205
[ Fry ] Bender!

20:45.895 --> 20:47.826
There. Good as new.

20:47.895 --> 20:50.448
- Don't you need this one?
- Oh, no!

20:50.517 --> 20:52.931
That's my--
[ Gagging ]

20:56.758 --> 20:59.000
Gotcha.

20:59.067 --> 21:01.378
Oh. Poor Bender.

21:01.448 --> 21:03.895
He must be
so lonely right now,

21:03.964 --> 21:06.654
trapped a thousand years
in the past.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.654
Hey, wait a second!

21:13.654 --> 21:15.067
[ Beeping ]

21:15.136 --> 21:17.067
Anything?No.

21:17.136 --> 21:19.067
[ Beeping Intensifies ]Wait!

21:19.136 --> 21:20.895
[ Bender ] Ow! Stupid jerk!

21:20.964 --> 21:23.862
He's alive!Whee!

21:26.550 --> 21:30.792
Bender!
What was it like lying in
that hole for a thousand years?

21:30.862 --> 21:33.344
I was enjoying it
until you guys showed up.

21:33.413 --> 21:36.689
Well, now everything
is back as it was.

21:36.758 --> 21:41.654
And if history doesn't care
that our degenerate friend Fry
is his own grandfather,

21:41.723 --> 21:43.654
then who are we to judge?

21:43.723 --> 21:45.931
Amen!
