{\an8}<i>- Here's what happened</i>

00:04.838 --> 00:06.306
{\an8}- I date nice guys.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.775
{\an8}- But, like, a part of me
does not care about--

00:08.842 --> 00:10.276
{\an9}- Don't.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.245
{\an8}<i>- I, like,</i>
<i>don't ever really get rejected.</i>

00:12.312 --> 00:15.448
{\an8}This might come off the wrong
way but like, I get what I want.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.489
{\an8}- I'm--I'm curious to see
if you hook up with your ex.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.691
{\an8}- I'm curious to see if you're
gonna hook up with your ex.

00:24.758 --> 00:25.859
{\an8}- Guys, really?

00:25.925 --> 00:29.396
{\an7}I have someone back home.
Stop it.

00:29.462 --> 00:31.197
- Why'd you guys break up?
- We were just--

00:31.264 --> 00:32.531
we're different people.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.034
Like, things just changed
after a while.

00:35.101 --> 00:37.237
- The first time you guys saw
the guys,

00:37.303 --> 00:38.805
who did you think
was attractive?

00:38.872 --> 00:40.373
Like, at first sight?

00:40.440 --> 00:42.409
{\an8}- Peter.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.144
{\an8}<i>- You never know</i>
<i>what's going to happen,</i>

00:44.210 --> 00:48.047
but if anything were to,
it would be Peter.

00:48.114 --> 00:50.183
{\an1}- So I go like--
I'm gonna go down like...

00:50.250 --> 00:51.684
I feel like this
is the real deal.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.086
- I like being with you.

00:53.153 --> 00:56.956
- I'll do anything

01:55.882 --> 01:57.817
{\an3}Five of us girls in there today?
And like--

01:57.884 --> 02:01.488
- I honestly can't--
- Imagine there's eight girls.

02:01.554 --> 02:03.656

to get ready?

02:03.723 --> 02:05.391

02:11.464 --> 02:14.067
{\an8}I know Robb looks stressed.

{\an8}I know he's not happy.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.847

02:32.418 --> 02:33.987

right now?

02:34.053 --> 02:36.055

Yo, what are you doing?

Yo, what are you tickling--
dude, you're a grown man,

02:39.359 --> 02:40.860
you should not be
tickling me, bro.

02:40.927 --> 02:43.730
What are you doing? Stop.
What the [bleep] are you doing?

02:47.333 --> 02:49.202
Stop tickling me, bro.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.803
{\an1}- Why are you so damn
buff and ticklish, man?

02:50.870 --> 02:52.472
{\an3}- Because, I just don't like
to be tickled, bro.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.240
- Huh?
- I'm telling you.

02:54.307 --> 02:56.109

02:56.175 --> 02:58.044

take them pants off, man.

Oh! Oh!

03:18.431 --> 03:19.832
{\an8}<i>What's up? How's everything?</i>

03:19.899 --> 03:23.970
{\an8}- I'm currently living
in a house in Seattle

03:24.037 --> 03:25.605
for "The Real World,"

03:25.672 --> 03:26.940
with my ex

03:27.006 --> 03:30.410
and everyone else's other person

03:30.476 --> 03:34.847
that they have
"unfinished business" with.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.149
{\an8}So...

03:36.215 --> 03:37.584
{\an8}- Yeah.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.385
{\an8}I have a boyfriend,
but we did kind of

03:39.452 --> 03:41.688
{\an8}only just meet two months ago.

03:41.754 --> 03:45.091
{\an8}So, leaving for two months,
it's not very easy

03:45.158 --> 03:49.862
{\an8}just getting up
and leaving a relationship.

03:49.929 --> 03:52.332
{\an8}- Yeah, I was too.

03:54.334 --> 03:56.436
{\an8}I mean, I don't want you
to worry about anything.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.471
{\an8}Like, nothing's going to happen.
Like, you can trust me.

03:58.538 --> 04:01.507
{\an8}Everything's going to be fine.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.944
{\an8}- Mm-hmm.
<i>- All right.</i>

04:05.011 --> 04:06.946
{\an8}- So, I'll talk to you later.
<i>- All right, bye.</i>

04:07.013 --> 04:08.948
{\an8}- [sighs]

04:13.219 --> 04:15.154
{\an8}Hi.

04:15.221 --> 04:16.990
{\an8}- John? No way? What'd he say?

04:17.055 --> 04:18.257
- I was like, "Bro,

04:18.324 --> 04:19.492
I come home to find Jenn
in the house,"

04:19.559 --> 04:22.829
{\an3}and he was like, "What?"
I was like--

04:22.895 --> 04:25.965
{\an1}- Surprise!
[sighs]

04:26.032 --> 04:29.235
- Yeah, he was like, "No way."
- That's hysterical.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.237
<i>- The thing that I'm most</i>
<i>worried about right now,</i>

04:31.304 --> 04:32.672
<i>with Jenn in the house,</i>

04:32.739 --> 04:34.607
{\an8}I just want to know
what her intentions are here.

04:34.674 --> 04:37.877
{\an8}You know? I know we didn't
leave off on the best of terms,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.380
but we didn't leave off
on the worst of terms.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.650
{\an1}- I still have a video of you
and him on my Instagram.

04:43.716 --> 04:45.218
{\an1}When you were, like,
playing with him?

04:45.284 --> 04:46.619
- That's crazy.

04:46.686 --> 04:49.222
{\an1}- And I still have the picture
of him bothering you.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.957
- I wasn't a terrible boyfriend.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.593
{\an3}I wasn't great, but I wasn't
a terrible boyfriend.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.428
{\an1}- No, no, I mean--
I mean, you probably think

04:55.495 --> 04:56.896
{\an1}I was talking
so much [bleep] about you.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.264
But I wasn't.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.233
{\an1}I was just, like I said,
just being defensive.

05:00.299 --> 05:01.768
{\an3}- I think we were
both being defensive.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.270
{\an8}- I know Robbie doesn't want
anything to do with her.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.972
{\an8}Like, this man has told me this.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.608
{\an8}But it's like, man, when you
see them around each other,

05:08.675 --> 05:10.777
you just see how they interact
and it just makes you wonder

05:10.843 --> 05:12.545
like what the hell
could've went wrong with y'all?

05:12.612 --> 05:15.348
Y'all seem like you're
just two peas in a pod.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.016
{\an3}- But I think it's just
on my end,

05:17.083 --> 05:18.251
just more unanswered questions,

05:18.317 --> 05:19.318
{\an3}so I was gonna see if you
wanted--

05:19.385 --> 05:20.453
- So let's go to lunch.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.888
- Do you want to do it tomorrow?

05:21.954 --> 05:23.656
- Do you want to do it tomorrow?
- Yeah.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.324
- We can do it tomorrow.
- Yeah, let's do it tomorrow.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.393
- You got that? Write that down.
Tomorrow, we're going to lunch.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.763
{\an7}If you want to come,
you're more than welcome.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.432
{\an8}[laughter]

05:32.498 --> 05:36.369
{\an8}<i>[rock music]</i>

05:36.436 --> 05:37.570
- I'm giving him a hand.

05:37.637 --> 05:40.973
If he hits me, it's game over.

05:42.742 --> 05:44.310
{\an1}- I'm happy that we're
sitting out here.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.479
I feel like I need a break.
- I think everyone will be fine,

05:46.546 --> 05:47.880
it'll just take some time.
- Yeah.

05:47.947 --> 05:49.415
I think the only people
that really need to get

05:49.482 --> 05:50.883
{\an1}over their hump
is Theo and his cousin

05:50.950 --> 05:53.052
because that is, again--
- That is deep [bleep].

05:53.119 --> 05:54.954
{\an3}That's deep. That's how I feel
with me and Lana.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.389
{\an3}Like, I just want
to get it over with.

05:56.456 --> 05:58.191
{\an3}But she has no problem
popping off,

05:58.257 --> 05:59.659
{\an3}and I have no problem
popping off her.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.260
{\an3}Because you pop off people
you're closest to.

06:01.327 --> 06:03.362
{\an3}At the end of the day, we were
like really, really close.

06:03.429 --> 06:04.797
<i>I don't really get it.</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:07.533
Lana was like my closest,
closest best friend.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.838
{\an8}- So, one night, Jordan went out
to a party--I did not go.

06:11.904 --> 06:14.741
{\an8}<i>- We were out at a party</i>
<i>and I was talking to this guy--</i>

06:14.807 --> 06:18.611
- She knew I liked him more
than he probably liked me.

06:18.678 --> 06:20.113
- He wasn't her man.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.582
- Just the whole night,
it was like video after video

06:22.648 --> 06:25.451
after video of them getting
drunker and drunker and drunker.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.954
- I took a picture
on Snapchat...

06:28.020 --> 06:29.889
- And they're like,
in his bedroom.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.057
- I did nothing wrong.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.126
- I felt like
she was taunting me.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.595
- The last time we talked was
the day of our fight.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.929
Almost a year ago.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.464
- We really did care
for each other

06:38.531 --> 06:40.199
and we really did look out
for each other.

06:40.266 --> 06:42.435
And I guess, as time went on,

06:42.502 --> 06:46.572
I felt like that
kind of disappeared.

06:46.639 --> 06:48.074
{\an3}- I have no idea
how it's gonna go.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.809
{\an3}Like, I have no problem like,
saying something to her.

06:49.876 --> 06:51.277
And she has no problem
saying something to me.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.479
'Cause we were so close.

06:55.314 --> 06:58.584
- Is this the place?
- Yeah.

06:58.651 --> 07:01.020
- I'm getting really nervous.
- Why?

07:01.087 --> 07:03.256
- No, don't get nervous.
- 'Cause it's just, like,

07:03.322 --> 07:05.191
what if I say what I have to say
and then it's just awkward

07:05.258 --> 07:06.726
and then we're just
sitting there, eating dinner?

07:06.793 --> 07:08.594
{\an1}- Wait, what are you going
to say though?

07:08.661 --> 07:11.164
- I, like--I just don't
understand what I did wrong.

07:11.230 --> 07:14.700
{\an3}And like, that--
having that unanswered feeling

07:14.767 --> 07:16.068
{\an3}is the reason
why I'm so insecure.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.804
'Cause I just beat
myself up over it.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.539
He just--done.

07:19.605 --> 07:21.541
- And in order for things
to work out with Travis,

07:21.607 --> 07:23.509
you need to close that door.
- Yeah.

07:23.576 --> 07:24.877
- Lock it, throw away the key.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.045
- No, for real.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.713
I don't think people get it.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.550
{\an1}Like, words hurt.
It affects you every single day.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.084
And that's huge.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.587
Because...

07:34.654 --> 07:36.455
Yeah, I know, 'cause I--
I become low.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.926
{\an8}Like, really, really low, and...

07:46.799 --> 07:48.100
I don't want to be
like that again,

07:48.167 --> 07:51.270
and I felt that way
when I was her friend.

07:51.337 --> 07:54.907
Depression and suicide
comes in many different ways.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.176
I told Jordan this,
and one day, I was just like,

07:57.243 --> 08:01.480
"I'm in a funk and I've tried
to commit suicide once."

08:01.547 --> 08:05.885
And she was just like, "What?"

08:05.952 --> 08:09.655
And I think she just didn't look
at me the same way

08:09.722 --> 08:12.091
as she did before.

08:12.158 --> 08:16.495
She doesn't think
suicide is like a--

08:16.562 --> 08:18.264
like, she just thinks
suicide is stupid.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.499
She's like, "that's dumb."
I mean, it's not that easy.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.602
{\an1}Like, people every day, like,
have mental diseases.

08:22.668 --> 08:25.805
Like, you don't want to live,
but she thinks it's dumb.

08:25.872 --> 08:27.707

"No, that's dumb, like,

{\an3}That's what I'm saying,

friend I had.

20:30.629 --> 20:32.631

20:32.698 --> 20:35.167
{\an3}now, like, back to that fight,
you never voiced anything.

20:35.233 --> 20:38.403

thought that I didn't care.

20:38.470 --> 20:40.205

so I hope you know--

20:40.272 --> 20:43.575

I'm not super sensitive,
I'm not super emotional,

20:45.377 --> 20:47.412
