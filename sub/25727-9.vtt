WEBVTT

00:05.359 --> 00:06.672
Oh. Hey.

00:06.673 --> 00:10.468
Oh. Hey. Funny seeing you here.

00:10.469 --> 00:13.145
- Happy Jeff's birthday.
- Happy Jeff's birthday to you.

00:13.163 --> 00:15.044
What's it been, like, six
weeks since we talked?

00:15.055 --> 00:17.058
- I guess.
- I mean, don't take it the wrong way,

00:17.059 --> 00:18.778
but probably the best
six weeks of my life.

00:18.789 --> 00:21.187
Oh. Same. I fell in love.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.688
- Oh, yeah, me, too.
- Oh!

00:22.689 --> 00:25.441
Love opened its doors,
and I walked right through.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.109
I also saved a baby turtle's life.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.880
You're just trying
to make out with a turtle?

00:28.891 --> 00:31.030
I could if I wanted to.
I know animal CPR.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.824
Oh. Well, that explains why
you're dressed as an actor

00:33.825 --> 00:35.284
in a catheter commercial.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.245
You look like a roadie for a kids band.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.163
- I look great.
- Well, great to see you.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.207
- Great to see you.
- Great to see you.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.292
- Best six weeks of my life.
- No regrets.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.919
Absolutely not.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.088
I think we know
I was right the whole time.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.506
Not now! Not now!

00:48.507 --> 00:50.091
- Great to see you.
- Great to see you.

00:50.092 --> 00:52.719
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

00:54.846 --> 00:57.890
Aw! You two are back together.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.061
Oh, we're not together.

00:59.072 --> 01:01.102
I actually didn't even know
he was sitting there.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.271
I'm just trying to sit
by the food table, you know?

01:03.272 --> 01:04.772
Let's catch up later, OK?

01:07.682 --> 01:09.183
Whoa.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.529
You got a black eye? You OK, buddy?

01:11.530 --> 01:13.739
Not like you would care.
It is your fault.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.284
You know, I'm willing to assume
that almost everything around me

01:16.285 --> 01:19.287
that's happening is my fault,
but I haven't seen you recently.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.123
It's your fault. You're responsible.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.593
_

01:25.252 --> 01:27.753
Let's just... yeah, let's
put it right over in the corner

01:27.754 --> 01:30.339
over here, OK? Oops! Watch...
watch your step. Here we go.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.466
Gotta make the room real nice for him.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.343
What's going on? This is my bedroom.

01:34.354 --> 01:37.458
No, this is Mr. Dodo's green room.
He's the star of "Monkey Sheldon".

01:37.469 --> 01:39.630
- "Sheldon," like the...?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a spinoff.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.393
Yeah, Sheldon uploaded his consciousness

01:42.404 --> 01:44.196
into a now-super-smart monkey.

01:44.207 --> 01:45.707
We're shooting the pilot here today.

01:45.718 --> 01:48.439
- Oh, yeah, yeah, come on in.
- My brother never told me that.

01:48.450 --> 01:50.741
Uh, well, he signed a contract.

01:50.752 --> 01:53.163
You really gotta go. You shoulda been
outta here yesterday.

01:53.174 --> 01:54.694
I have nowhere to go!

01:54.705 --> 01:56.740
You want me to go to my parents' beach
house? Do you know how far it is?

01:56.751 --> 01:57.959
It's all the way in Malibu!

01:57.970 --> 01:59.471
- Hey! Shh! Relax. Hey, man.
- Shh. Hey.

01:59.489 --> 02:01.448
Mr. Dodo just flew in
from a shoot in Budapest.

02:01.459 --> 02:03.679
Don't want to make him grouchy,
and your squeaky voice

02:03.680 --> 02:05.973
- is triggering to him.
- For the love of God,

02:05.974 --> 02:08.017
who put the monkey sailor suits
with the monkey hat?

02:08.018 --> 02:10.436
- That's my hat!
- Oh.

02:10.437 --> 02:11.729
How did you even get in here?

02:11.730 --> 02:12.855
I came by here last week

02:12.866 --> 02:15.306
and I got a key from your sister.

02:15.317 --> 02:17.652
'Bout this big.

02:17.653 --> 02:19.821
Face full of glitter?

02:19.822 --> 02:21.906
Uses her hair as a napkin?

02:21.907 --> 02:25.701
Oh! So that's who I gave my key to.

02:25.702 --> 02:28.121
Yeah. You just give
house keys out to everyone?

02:28.122 --> 02:29.914
Would you just give
a house key to a serial killer

02:29.915 --> 02:32.458
or some random dude
you go on one date with?

02:32.459 --> 02:35.586
Yeah. If they're hot
and nice to me, I would.

02:35.587 --> 02:37.464
As a matter of fact, happened recently.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.680
I like it, but I don't love it.

02:45.681 --> 02:47.390
Miss, I need you to pick a flavor.

02:47.391 --> 02:48.724
You're holdin' up the line.

02:48.725 --> 02:49.851
Go with cereal milk.

02:49.852 --> 02:51.727
This time of night,
the only toppings left

02:51.728 --> 02:54.897
are the dried cereals anyway,
so it sorta just works.

02:54.898 --> 02:58.776
- OK, I'll do that.
- Me, too. Thanks.

02:58.777 --> 03:00.486
- Great. Here you go.
- Thank you.

03:00.487 --> 03:02.572
- I'm sorry about that.
- No.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.490
I recently went through
a friend breakup,

03:04.491 --> 03:06.617
and I had to switch fro-yo locations.

03:06.618 --> 03:08.536
Yeah, no, I could tell.

03:08.537 --> 03:11.289
I can kind of spot people
who are switching

03:11.290 --> 03:13.791
fro-yo locations
because of personal drama.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.376
It's part of my job.

03:15.377 --> 03:17.378
- What's your job?
- I'm a sheriff.

03:18.505 --> 03:19.589
No, I'm an actor.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.591
Or a struggling, wannabe actor.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.361
Did you just put Muesli and
Fruity Pebbles in the same bowl?

03:24.372 --> 03:26.971
Oh, well, I'm half toddler,
half senior citizen.

03:26.982 --> 03:29.349
- I'm full toddler.
- Oh, then allow me.

03:29.857 --> 03:31.614
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.590
It's OK.

03:35.601 --> 03:37.352
What did you say your name was?

03:37.353 --> 03:38.701
It's Wes.

03:39.439 --> 03:41.440
Can we hang out right now?

03:41.456 --> 03:43.040
- Yeah.
- Cool.

03:48.364 --> 03:49.365
Awesome.

03:50.408 --> 03:52.075
Jeff, what's up, dude!

03:52.076 --> 03:54.119
<i>You called me nine times this morning.</i>

03:54.120 --> 03:55.829
<i>That's what's up.
I'm not comin' to Malibu.</i>

03:55.830 --> 03:59.499
Please. It sucks here.
I'm so isolated, and it's overcast.

03:59.510 --> 04:02.143
<i>No one feels bad for you. You're
at your parents' house in Malibu.</i>

04:02.154 --> 04:04.240
<i>Peace, brother.</i>

04:05.650 --> 04:07.549
Hey. Sorry about that.

04:07.550 --> 04:10.552
No worries, dude. If you want,
I've got a house close by.

04:10.553 --> 04:13.305
You guys can come over, have an
ice cream sandwich, maybe a soda.

04:13.306 --> 04:15.236
You and your son can shower.

04:15.806 --> 04:17.339
Why would we shower at your house?

04:17.351 --> 04:20.437
Oh! I meant like an outdoor sand shower

04:20.438 --> 04:22.626
for your feet. I wasn't bein' weird.

04:23.691 --> 04:26.275
Guys! Let's pack it up!

04:26.286 --> 04:28.181
We'll move down the beach a little bit!

04:31.365 --> 04:33.657
- Do you want popcorn right now?
- Sure.

04:33.668 --> 04:35.043
OK!

04:35.359 --> 04:36.902
- OK, hold on.
- Hm?

04:36.913 --> 04:39.456
Do you bring popcorn home
from the movie theater?

04:39.457 --> 04:42.542
Yeah. It's just a trick I
learned from my ancestors.

04:42.543 --> 04:45.253
Do you also bring ranch salt

04:45.254 --> 04:48.590
- to the movie theater from home?
- How did you know that?

04:48.591 --> 04:49.925
- Are you from the Midwest?
- Are you from the Midwest?

04:49.926 --> 04:51.510
Wisconsin.

04:51.511 --> 04:53.970
Illinois. But you don't have
a Wisconsin accent.

04:53.971 --> 04:56.348
I totally got rid of it
when I moved here.

04:56.349 --> 04:59.351
Midwest accents are so sexy.

04:59.352 --> 05:02.562
Bag. Chicago. Sausage.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.648
- You're cute.
- Wait, what... what's going on?

05:04.649 --> 05:07.234
Sorry. I... Sorry.

05:07.235 --> 05:08.777
Uh, I totally misread that.

05:08.778 --> 05:11.363
I'm sorry. I have been
best friends with a guy

05:11.364 --> 05:15.700
for so long, I forgot
that kissing and boys and me

05:15.701 --> 05:17.619
could, like, be a thing.

05:17.620 --> 05:21.540
Come on. I mean, you just
seamlessly worked "sausage"

05:21.541 --> 05:23.834
- into a conversation, and
now you think that -

05:23.835 --> 05:26.837
I'm gonna believe that guys aren't
trying to kiss you everywhere you go?

05:26.838 --> 05:29.381
Um, I'm just gonna roll with this.

05:29.382 --> 05:31.591
But before you kiss me,
there's some things

05:31.592 --> 05:33.635
- I want you to know. OK?
- All right.

05:33.636 --> 05:37.514
Number one, I have really dry lip
skin, and it sheds every three hours.

05:37.515 --> 05:38.932
Have you tried coconut oil?

05:38.933 --> 05:40.559
Yes, and I'm not looking for solutions.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.603
Number two, I have bad breath.
Like, it's bad.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.315
Number three, is I'm really clingy.

05:56.284 --> 05:57.285
Hey!

05:59.036 --> 06:00.704
I... I think you're caught in a riptide!

06:00.705 --> 06:02.706
You gotta go parallel with the shore!

06:02.707 --> 06:04.249
I think!

06:04.250 --> 06:06.544
Use your legs! Oh, God.

06:09.046 --> 06:11.340
Be a hero. Be a hero!

06:23.019 --> 06:26.479
What was that? Are you trying
to be a hero or something?

06:26.480 --> 06:29.900
I was trying to save you, and
then you started hitting me.

06:29.901 --> 06:33.236
I was doing sea yoga,
and you were strangling me.

06:33.237 --> 06:34.530
Sea yoga?!

06:36.699 --> 06:40.702
Poor thing. You want
to come over for some tea?

06:40.703 --> 06:44.831
Sure I'm... pretty cold, and...
my blood doesn't circulate well.

06:44.832 --> 06:46.666
I think it's 'cause I was a C-section.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.127
Oh, come on.

06:50.129 --> 06:54.507
Number 52, I plan to have raised
300 dogs by the time I'm 35.

06:54.508 --> 06:56.677
I'm fine with that.
I'm fine with all of it.

06:57.887 --> 07:00.347
So, what now?

07:00.348 --> 07:04.476
Um, I don't know, because
nobody's ever gotten this far?

07:04.477 --> 07:06.061
- Should we...?
- Kiss?

07:06.062 --> 07:08.188
- Yeah.
- OK.

07:08.189 --> 07:11.524
Oh, uh, do I have anything in my teeth?

07:11.525 --> 07:12.526
- Not really.
- OK.

07:15.741 --> 07:18.437
OK, everybody, find your hiding spots!

07:18.448 --> 07:21.033
Jeff is five minutes away!

07:21.202 --> 07:22.702
You got Jeff a Starbucks gift card?

07:22.703 --> 07:24.537
That's my go-to gift idea.

07:24.538 --> 07:26.706
It's a Starbucks gift card.
It's literally the least

07:26.707 --> 07:29.459
you can do for a person where they
still have to say, "Thank you."

07:29.460 --> 07:34.131
Hi. Um. Did one of you eat a
frosting rose off of Jeff's cake?

07:35.132 --> 07:36.341
Wha...?

07:36.342 --> 07:37.634
That's a weird question, Tara.

07:37.635 --> 07:39.275
You know, there's a island of trash

07:39.286 --> 07:40.929
in the Pacific Ocean the size of Texas.

07:40.930 --> 07:42.639
Do you want to blame us for that, too?

07:43.974 --> 07:46.685
Did you just stand up for me?

07:46.686 --> 07:50.313
I mean, I had to, you have
active frosting on your face.

07:50.314 --> 07:52.315
- Uh, thanks.
- Other side.

07:52.316 --> 07:54.609
You also have frosting in your hair.

07:54.610 --> 07:56.361
It's so weird talking to you again.

07:56.362 --> 07:58.489
I just got really used to
self-reliant women.

08:05.287 --> 08:06.788
You met Axl Rose?

08:06.789 --> 08:10.418
I met William Rose. I made him Axl.

08:11.585 --> 08:13.003
You look amazing in that light.

08:14.505 --> 08:16.715
You're really drawing me?

08:16.716 --> 08:18.091
I'm in a woman's robe right now.

08:18.092 --> 08:21.136
You know what might make you
feel more comfortable?

08:21.137 --> 08:23.556
Take off the robe, and put this on.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.477
I'll do this here,
but in, like, vintage stores,

08:29.478 --> 08:31.813
I never put on leather jackets,
'cause I feel like

08:31.814 --> 08:33.566
they all belong to dead people.

08:35.693 --> 08:37.777
How's that feel?

08:37.778 --> 08:40.280
I feel like Andrew Dice Clay's
stepson right now.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.698
- Lose the robe. -I don't
think anyone wants that.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.659
- I do.
- Why?

08:44.660 --> 08:48.163
You see, I like pulling trash
out of the ocean,

08:48.164 --> 08:49.873
molding it into something beautiful,

08:49.874 --> 08:53.461
and I think I can work with you.

09:44.637 --> 09:48.640
Mmm. Boxed potatoes, baby.

09:48.641 --> 09:49.641
The absolute best.

09:49.642 --> 09:51.726
I know, and they're magical,

09:51.727 --> 09:53.645
'cause they start out as sawdust,

09:53.646 --> 09:57.023
but then they become potatoes.
Coastal elites don't get it.

09:57.024 --> 10:01.528
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. OK.

10:01.529 --> 10:04.864
I just remembered
that I have a little surprise.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.491
OK.

10:06.492 --> 10:08.868
Check out this blessed little angel.

10:08.869 --> 10:12.872
Oh. You, uh, combo-ed our faces

10:12.873 --> 10:16.543
to make a baby picture.
Th... uh, that's... that's cool.

10:16.544 --> 10:19.087
I know, it's, like,
horrifically perfect.

10:19.088 --> 10:21.756
- Um...
- Oh, God.

10:21.757 --> 10:24.334
The baby was too much. I'm so stupid.

10:24.345 --> 10:25.972
I should have just done the elderly one,

10:25.983 --> 10:27.804
but I aged well and you didn't, and...

10:27.805 --> 10:30.598
No. Stop. It's not that.

10:30.599 --> 10:33.268
So, I just got so close
to booking the lead

10:33.269 --> 10:35.812
on this prank show
called "You Got Gacked,"

10:35.813 --> 10:39.691
but it turns out, they went with
Robert Downey Junior Junior.

10:39.692 --> 10:42.610
That's OK. You're gonna get
the next one. Who cares?

10:42.611 --> 10:44.863
Look, Esther, I've been here
for 10 years, OK?

10:44.864 --> 10:49.534
And the only job I booked was a
voiceover gig for Farmers Only.

10:49.535 --> 10:51.953
It's the dating site
for farmers and ranch hands.

10:51.954 --> 10:53.496
- I'm familiar.
- Look.

10:53.497 --> 10:55.039
Did I knock it out of the park?

10:55.040 --> 10:56.749
Absolutely, I crushed it.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.043
But even that is kinda pathetic.

10:59.044 --> 11:01.379
I can't do it anymore.

11:01.380 --> 11:05.884
I'm, uh... I'm gonna move
back to Wisconsin.

11:05.885 --> 11:08.178
What? What...? When? Why?

11:08.179 --> 11:10.263
I just don't belong here.

11:10.264 --> 11:13.933
But I deleted so many photos
off my phone

11:13.934 --> 11:17.187
so that I could fit
the face changing app onto it.

11:17.188 --> 11:19.397
-I have... I have to go. -OK.

11:19.398 --> 11:22.484
- Wait. Please. Your potatoes.
- This is crazy.

11:29.658 --> 11:32.577
Benji? Benji!

11:32.578 --> 11:34.287
Hey, you must be the monkey groomer.

11:34.288 --> 11:36.080
I should warn you. We just did a scene

11:36.081 --> 11:38.333
where Mr. Dodo had to watch
two of his human co-stars

11:38.334 --> 11:39.918
eat a banana. He is very upset.

11:39.919 --> 11:43.338
What? No. I'm looking
for my friend, Benji.

11:43.339 --> 11:44.797
He usually helps me when I'm sad

11:44.798 --> 11:46.007
by pointing out all my flaws,

11:46.008 --> 11:48.093
and then telling me how unique they are.

11:49.762 --> 11:51.346
There's no Benji here on set.

11:51.347 --> 11:54.182
If you're not the groomer,
you don't belong here.

11:54.183 --> 11:56.893
You know what? You're right.

11:56.894 --> 11:59.605
I don't belong here. Thank you.

12:01.690 --> 12:04.901
But I will brush out that
monkey for a hundred bucks.

12:04.902 --> 12:06.445
- Psh. Come on in, girl.
- Thank you.

12:10.298 --> 12:12.825
Have you ever thought about
selling your stuff in a gallery

12:12.826 --> 12:15.411
or one of those weird rich
lady stores in Santa Monica?

12:15.412 --> 12:20.041
There is this festival in Australia
I've always wanted to go to.

12:20.042 --> 12:25.004
Sculptures by the Sea. It's a real
who's-who of sea trash artists.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.839
Why would you want to go to Australia?

12:26.840 --> 12:29.926
I mean, I've had three drinks
thrown at me in my life.

12:29.927 --> 12:32.428
All Australians. Nothing good
comes out of that place.

12:32.429 --> 12:34.681
AC/DC, man!

12:34.682 --> 12:37.225
I mean, AC/DC is just entrance music

12:37.226 --> 12:39.227
for hockey teams, a this point.

12:39.228 --> 12:43.982
My God, relax. You're always so serious.

12:43.983 --> 12:45.526
That feels good.

12:48.904 --> 12:50.530
Whoa! OK, no. I don't do that stuff.

12:50.531 --> 12:52.240
I'm sorry. That's my no-no zone.

12:52.241 --> 12:54.826
What happened to fun, loose Benji?

12:54.827 --> 12:56.662
He's very far away! Very far!

12:56.673 --> 12:58.288
I'm sorry I'm not who you want me to be!

12:58.289 --> 12:59.831
I'm not even who I want to be!

12:59.832 --> 13:01.875
Thank you very much, though! Bye-bye!

13:07.881 --> 13:11.092
Be honest. Did the sea lady's
sculpture look as much like you

13:11.093 --> 13:13.011
as that clump of hair
I pulled out of my drain?

13:13.012 --> 13:16.222
You know that clump of hair
looked exactly like you.

13:16.223 --> 13:17.515
Bitter, much?

13:17.516 --> 13:18.891
Sorry I wasn't there for you

13:18.892 --> 13:20.935
when Mr. Wisconsin Cheese Boy

13:20.936 --> 13:23.688
abandoned your ass, but I was busy

13:23.689 --> 13:25.189
humping to the rhythm of the ocean.

13:26.525 --> 13:29.110
Cone on, Jeff. I saved us a table!

13:29.111 --> 13:30.987
- Surprise!
- Aah!

13:30.988 --> 13:32.989
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

13:32.990 --> 13:35.533
Oh, my God! I totally
didn't see this coming!

13:35.534 --> 13:36.784
Happy birthday, sexy.

13:36.785 --> 13:37.870
Oh, thank you.

13:39.747 --> 13:40.955
What the hell is happening?

13:40.956 --> 13:42.915
They're saying hello like Europeans.

13:42.916 --> 13:44.751
Is this a new birthday tradition?

13:44.752 --> 13:46.711
All right, Jeff, let's do it.

13:46.712 --> 13:49.005
Oh, no, Esther.

13:49.006 --> 13:51.716
See, I told you. I told you they
had no idea we were going out.

13:51.717 --> 13:54.052
- What?
- Like boyfriend/girlfriend?

13:54.053 --> 13:57.096
You guys are the most self-centered
people I have ever met.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.042
In my entire life.

13:59.053 --> 14:00.975
But thanks for coming
to my birthday party.

14:00.986 --> 14:02.614
Self-centered? Is that fair?

14:02.625 --> 14:04.979
Your girlfriend threw you a
party without an open bar.

14:04.980 --> 14:07.106
What happened to you? Did
Esther give you a black eye?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.026
In a roundabout way, yeah, she did.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.950
- <i>Hey, it's Esther.
- Rock the vote.</i> -

14:17.951 --> 14:19.744
You're probably still
mad at me, or whatever,

14:19.745 --> 14:22.998
but I wanted to call you
and tell you that...

14:24.958 --> 14:28.127
a love goddess tried to go
upstream in my Mississippi,

14:28.128 --> 14:30.922
and... I couldn't do it.

14:30.923 --> 14:34.217
I'm not a sexual rock star. I'm just
not comfortable letting someone in.

14:34.218 --> 14:36.761
<i>To send this message now, press "one."</i>

14:36.762 --> 14:38.414
<i>To erase, press "two."</i>

14:40.554 --> 14:41.974
Why won't you let her in?

14:41.975 --> 14:44.683
I heard the end of your conversation.

14:44.694 --> 14:46.957
There's this woman, and she's great,

14:46.968 --> 14:49.315
but she wants our relationship
to go somewhere

14:49.316 --> 14:50.983
I'm just not comfortable with.

14:50.984 --> 14:55.655
Relationships are tricky.
My advice? Open up.

14:55.656 --> 15:00.159
I never did, and now all I have
are my regrets, my thoughts,

15:00.160 --> 15:03.663
and the most expensive
consumer-legal drone in America.

15:03.664 --> 15:07.166
Right, but I'm also concerned
it might physically hurt.

15:07.167 --> 15:10.169
I've never had a girl ruin her
manicure in my blowhole before.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.589
I now realize we're talking about
two totally different things.

15:13.590 --> 15:15.842
I know what I'm gonna do.
Thanks for the advice, man.

15:19.054 --> 15:21.097
Take me to the magic of the moment.

15:30.023 --> 15:32.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:32.192 --> 15:37.030
I was waiting for you. I just really
didn't want this to end on a bad note.

15:37.990 --> 15:39.907
Also, I fixed your toilet handle.

15:39.908 --> 15:41.492
Um, so now you don't have to

15:41.493 --> 15:44.036
pull on a piece of yarn
to make it flush.

15:44.037 --> 15:45.788
Oh, God, that's so hot.

15:45.789 --> 15:47.290
- Thanks.
- I've been thinking,

15:47.291 --> 15:50.168
and I realized that
I want to come with you.

15:50.169 --> 15:54.630
Come on, Esther, you're
gonna go across the country for me?

15:54.631 --> 15:56.424
I miss lakes, and I miss shade.

15:56.425 --> 15:58.801
And I miss using bad weather
as an excuse to stay inside

15:58.802 --> 16:00.219
for six months out of the year.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.430
Yeah? Me, too.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.017
Plus, we'll be driving distance
from my parents' dogs,

16:06.018 --> 16:07.518
and that is huge for me.

16:07.519 --> 16:09.262
Yeah, I know.
You've mentioned that a lot.

16:10.063 --> 16:13.107
- So?
- I really liked it,

16:13.108 --> 16:17.028
but I think it's a special
occasion kinda thing.

16:17.029 --> 16:19.655
Every day is a special occasion.

16:19.656 --> 16:23.868
I was thinking, I'd go to Australia.

16:23.869 --> 16:25.953
I went to high school
with Mel Gibson's kids,

16:25.954 --> 16:27.371
and one of them was nice to me,

16:27.372 --> 16:30.791
so if you wanna go, let's go!

16:30.792 --> 16:32.044
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:37.341 --> 16:39.300
- Hey.
- Hey!

16:39.301 --> 16:42.053
So, I have some pretty good news.

16:42.054 --> 16:43.304
OK.

16:43.305 --> 16:46.224
I got into that online vet tech course.

16:46.225 --> 16:47.725
Wow!

16:47.726 --> 16:49.477
And the best part is, did you know

16:49.478 --> 16:52.396
you can just walk into a
store and buy scrubs?

16:52.397 --> 16:54.857
You don't even need, like, a
degree or a license or anything.

16:54.858 --> 16:57.068
- So, I have big news, too.
- Oh, my God. What?

16:57.069 --> 17:00.529
The producers from "You Got
Gacked" just called me,

17:00.530 --> 17:06.578
and Robert Downey Junior Junior
dropped out. I got the part!

17:07.871 --> 17:09.704
That's great. Great.

17:09.705 --> 17:13.041
But you're not gonna take it,
'cause we're gonna move.

17:13.042 --> 17:15.377
- Obviously.
- Yeah.

17:15.378 --> 17:18.256
What am I thinking? Uh...

17:18.257 --> 17:20.174
No way. I... I'm not taking that job.

17:20.175 --> 17:23.135
OK. Whew! That was scary for a second.

17:23.136 --> 17:26.722
Uh-huh. I do have to tell you
something else, though.

17:26.723 --> 17:28.724
OK, what?

17:28.725 --> 17:30.102
You just got gacked.

17:31.770 --> 17:33.939
- What?
- You just got gacked.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.232
I don't...

17:36.233 --> 17:38.234
Y-you got gacked. I gacked you.

17:38.235 --> 17:40.945
I... I have to take the job.
I mean, you see that?

17:40.946 --> 17:42.238
Are... what?

17:42.239 --> 17:44.198
I'm not gonna be in the right headspace

17:44.199 --> 17:46.367
to be dating. I'm sorry.
I still want to be friends.

17:46.368 --> 17:50.955
No. You just broke my heart.
And you gacked me.

17:50.956 --> 17:53.583
Yeah. I shoulda just done
one or the other.

17:53.584 --> 17:54.585
Get out!

17:55.836 --> 17:58.004
Drone guy! What's up, dude?

17:58.005 --> 18:01.299
You gave me great advice. I'm a new man!

18:01.300 --> 18:04.135
I'm barefoot,
I got a soul patch cookin',

18:04.136 --> 18:07.847
and I got two tickets to
Australia for me and my lover.

18:07.848 --> 18:10.016
Agree to disagree on the soul patch,

18:10.017 --> 18:11.559
but other than that, glad to hear it.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.686
Cool. Huh.

18:13.687 --> 18:16.022
That's weird. Her trailer's gone.

18:16.023 --> 18:19.609
Oh, Tia? Uh, she cut out
in the middle of the night.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.468
What? She left without saying goodbye?

18:21.479 --> 18:23.410
Is that who you were talking
about the other day?

18:23.421 --> 18:24.614
Yeah.

18:24.615 --> 18:26.032
If I'd a-known, I woulda told you

18:26.033 --> 18:27.199
not to get too attached.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.576
Dude!

18:28.577 --> 18:31.288
Would it make you feel better
to fly a $20,000 drone?

18:33.040 --> 18:34.040
Yeah, it would.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.459
So you flew a drone

18:36.460 --> 18:39.378
into your own face, and it's my fault?

18:39.379 --> 18:41.074
Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't have been talking

18:41.085 --> 18:43.424
to weirdos on the beach if you
would just pick up your phone.

18:43.425 --> 18:44.842
Well, then, you know what?

18:44.843 --> 18:47.470
It's your fault
that I got my heart broken

18:47.471 --> 18:50.973
by the lowest of the low in our society.

18:50.974 --> 18:52.558
A kids' prank show host.

18:52.559 --> 18:54.004
Since you're a vet now, or whatever,

18:54.015 --> 18:55.641
can you look at my eye
and make sure I'm OK?

18:55.652 --> 18:57.605
A vet <i>technician.</i>

18:57.606 --> 19:00.441
And... I quit on my first day.

19:00.442 --> 19:02.276
They expect you to treat snakes

19:02.277 --> 19:04.028
the same way you treat puppies.

19:04.029 --> 19:05.697
And that's a "heck, no."

19:06.981 --> 19:08.724
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey!

19:08.735 --> 19:10.552
Hey. I wanted to wish you
a happy birthday

19:10.563 --> 19:12.106
from me and Esther.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.326
I knew you guys would find
your way back to each other.

19:14.599 --> 19:16.999
And as nice as these
Starbucks gift cards are,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.511
don't worry about it. You already
got me the best gift of all.

19:20.903 --> 19:23.255
Me. He's talking about me.

19:23.256 --> 19:25.175
- Yeah.
- You introduced us?

19:26.770 --> 19:29.005
You know, he actually doesn't
even really like coffee.

19:29.016 --> 19:31.931
You know what, it's all right,
'cause I like the paninis.

19:31.932 --> 19:34.809
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

19:34.810 --> 19:36.268
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

19:36.269 --> 19:38.312
Wasn't that what
your big fight was about?

19:38.313 --> 19:39.647
What fight?

19:39.648 --> 19:43.106
This is the best panini I've ever eaten.

19:43.117 --> 19:45.575
It's good, but it's not a panini.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.630
- Yeah, it is.
- It's not the right bread.

19:47.641 --> 19:50.074
Panini isn't a style of bread,
it's a style of sandwich.

19:50.075 --> 19:52.533
You need a right bread for the
panini, like you need a bread shell,

19:52.544 --> 19:54.777
because when you apply the
heat and pressure to sandwich,

19:54.788 --> 19:57.134
everything comes out. But if
you use, like, a ciabatta,

19:57.145 --> 19:58.749
the traditional panini bread...

19:58.750 --> 20:00.958
- it holds everything in.
- Really, to make a panini,

20:00.969 --> 20:02.989
you just need
two pieces of bread, right?

20:03.000 --> 20:05.423
And then any kind
of middle that you want.

20:05.424 --> 20:07.758
- And then a panini press.
- But you can't just use any bread.

20:07.759 --> 20:09.343
- Like if you...
- You certainly can use any bread.

20:09.344 --> 20:11.721
That's what makes it a panini,
is the sandwich, the press.

20:11.722 --> 20:14.432
If you put a calzone in a panini press,
is that now a panini?

20:14.433 --> 20:16.600
Are you trying to make a calzone panini,

20:16.601 --> 20:19.229
in which case, you can.
Invent that. You'll be a millionaire!

20:19.240 --> 20:20.489
- You need a bread shell!
- You don't!

20:20.500 --> 20:21.781
Otherwise, it's not a panini!

20:21.792 --> 20:22.857
- That's not true!
- Yes!

20:22.858 --> 20:25.735
A panini is a world unto itself.
And it needs a bread shell!

20:25.736 --> 20:27.069
- That's what happens!
- Get out of my house!

20:27.070 --> 20:28.237
I will love to get out of your house.

20:28.238 --> 20:29.655
Get out of my house! Get... get out!

20:29.656 --> 20:32.074
Because you know <i>nothing</i>
about making paninis!

20:32.075 --> 20:33.325
I know nothing. I need friends who know

20:33.326 --> 20:35.119
what a freakin' panini is!

20:35.120 --> 20:36.620
- That's what I need.

20:36.621 --> 20:37.705
Are you here? Are you here right now?

20:37.706 --> 20:39.165
- I'm gone.
- Oh, OK.

20:39.166 --> 20:42.042

when I say, "Friendship, over."

20:42.043 --> 20:43.753
- OK.
- I don't need this.

20:43.754 --> 20:45.343
Oh, OK. Great. Like I need this.

20:45.354 --> 20:47.449

20:47.460 --> 20:48.541
"Panini," idiot.
