WEBVTT

00:03.473 --> 00:05.939
crash-landed on Earth. We
came here seeking refuge,

00:05.941 --> 00:08.642
but the humans thought
that it was an invasion.

00:11.113 --> 00:14.315
That night I met a human girl
who tried to protect me...

00:14.317 --> 00:16.550
A girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.552 --> 00:18.919
The surviving members
of my race, the Atrians,

00:18.921 --> 00:22.656
were rounded up and isolated
inside a militarized sector.

00:22.658 --> 00:24.391
Now it's 2024.

00:24.393 --> 00:26.360
Seven of us have been
chosen to attend high school

00:26.362 --> 00:27.861
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.046
But the humans and Atrians

00:30.048 --> 00:32.048
continue to distrust each other,

00:32.049 --> 00:34.651
while I fight to protect
my people and the human girl

00:34.653 --> 00:38.021
who saved my life... At any cost.

00:38.023 --> 00:40.090
Previously on Star-Crossed:

00:40.092 --> 00:42.992
You must deliver this to our
operative living outside the sector.

00:42.994 --> 00:45.395
- She's had her markings removed.
- I can't believe you're my contact.

00:45.397 --> 00:47.030
Been watching you and
Taylor do your little dance

00:47.032 --> 00:49.299
for weeks now, and I
didn't think that you were

00:49.301 --> 00:50.867
actually gonna go through with it.

00:50.877 --> 00:52.277
Look, you don't have to accept my parents

00:52.279 --> 00:54.412
or trust them.

00:54.414 --> 00:56.281
You don't think your parents will order

00:56.283 --> 00:59.050
- some kind of Red Hawk attack, do you?
- No, no way.

00:59.052 --> 01:00.985
I'm willing to trust you.

01:04.456 --> 01:07.158
Here now, but the market...
It's just past the east gate.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.027
All right, so when we
detonate the bomb here,

01:09.029 --> 01:11.362
exit on foot going through the west gate.

01:11.364 --> 01:12.630
It's perfect timing.

01:12.632 --> 01:13.965
Market will be full of those freaks.

01:13.967 --> 01:15.600
What do you got there?

01:16.869 --> 01:19.270
Get out of here, little girl.

01:19.272 --> 01:20.738
I'm not a little girl.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.074
Aah!

01:24.778 --> 01:27.245
I'm one of those Atrian freaks

01:27.247 --> 01:29.514
that you're so fond of.

01:29.516 --> 01:32.016
You know, if you're not careful...

01:33.520 --> 01:36.087
You might just blow yourselves up.

01:37.256 --> 01:40.324
Now, why don't you start talking?

01:42.000 --> 01:48.074

02:13.091 --> 02:14.692
We interrupt

02:14.694 --> 02:16.494
this digital broadcast with breaking news.

02:16.496 --> 02:18.329
Officials are investigating

02:18.331 --> 02:20.764
whether the victims who
mistakenly detonated explosives

02:20.766 --> 02:23.200
last night may have been Red Hawks.

02:23.202 --> 02:24.535
Blueprints found at the scene suggest

02:24.537 --> 02:28.172
the failed attack was
planned for the Atrian sector.

02:41.052 --> 02:42.586
Matt Bandell.

02:42.588 --> 02:44.388
I remember you.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.622
From the swim meet.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.058
Reporter for the Smatter Chatter.

02:48.060 --> 02:49.426
The online tabloid.

02:49.428 --> 02:52.062
So, Matt Bandell from the Smatter Chatter.

02:52.064 --> 02:53.630
Care to explain why you're following me?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.899
Uh, I need a quote for
a story I'm working on.

02:55.901 --> 02:58.535
About reporters stalking young
girls on their morning run?

02:58.537 --> 02:59.503
No.

02:59.505 --> 03:01.538
About cyper.

03:02.707 --> 03:05.042
That's that bogus Atrian herb, right?

03:05.044 --> 03:06.476
Well, people say it cures disease,

03:06.478 --> 03:08.879
but I don't need to tell you that.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.687
Cyper's real.

03:17.689 --> 03:18.722
You know.

03:18.724 --> 03:20.791
You were saying?

03:20.793 --> 03:22.592
I was just discussing with my friend

03:22.594 --> 03:24.060
a conspiracy web site.

03:24.062 --> 03:26.429
I was telling her that
I read that it was real.

03:26.431 --> 03:28.231
How is that a story?

03:28.233 --> 03:30.734
Well, I know the two of you
were both sick for a long time

03:30.736 --> 03:31.835
and are now both cured.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.570
Yeah, thanks to modern medicine.

03:33.572 --> 03:35.705
Or could it have
something to do with cyper?

03:35.707 --> 03:38.808
I don't care what a web site says.

03:38.810 --> 03:41.211
Cyper's a hoax.

03:41.213 --> 03:42.946
Do you really want to turn us into freaks

03:42.948 --> 03:44.481
of our high school based on a hunch?

03:44.483 --> 03:47.717
And if you publish this fake story,

03:47.719 --> 03:50.386
you're gonna be made into a pariah, too.

03:50.388 --> 03:51.855
You want an exclusive story?

03:51.857 --> 03:54.290
Something that can get
you some real attention?

03:54.292 --> 03:55.725
Why should I listen to you?

03:55.727 --> 03:57.460
Because I have something you don't:

03:57.462 --> 03:58.728
Access.

03:58.730 --> 04:01.164
I go to school with the Atrian seven.

04:01.166 --> 04:03.366
I can get you something better than cyper.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.735
All right.

04:05.737 --> 04:07.637
If you can bring me a juicier story

04:07.639 --> 04:09.339
in the next 48 hours, I'll publish it.

04:09.341 --> 04:11.174
If not, I'm running with

04:11.176 --> 04:12.575
what I've got on cyper.

04:33.397 --> 04:35.765
Rumor has it those red
hawk savages were aiming

04:35.767 --> 04:38.267
for the market when they
blew themselves up last night.

04:38.269 --> 04:40.770
Still convinced the humans
aren't out to wipe us all off

04:40.772 --> 04:42.004
the face of their earth?

04:42.006 --> 04:44.307
Not all humans are Red Hawks, Drake.

04:44.309 --> 04:45.574
Look around you, Roman.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.710
Humans put us in this prison.

04:47.712 --> 04:49.178
That's why I don't make a distinction.

04:49.180 --> 04:52.081
Oh, that's right, you're a Trag now, you
only see the world in black and white.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.749
Trags see the world how it is.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.284
And soon it'll be our world.

04:55.286 --> 04:56.318
Hey...

04:56.320 --> 04:58.821
What are the Trags planning?

04:58.823 --> 05:01.157
It's either us or the humans, Roman.

05:01.159 --> 05:02.291
I made a choice.

05:02.293 --> 05:03.493
You should, too.

05:03.495 --> 05:05.694
War is not the only way
to get our freedom back.

05:05.696 --> 05:06.962
And integration is?

05:06.964 --> 05:08.430
I don't want to share this planet

05:08.432 --> 05:10.499
with people who want to annihilate us.

05:10.501 --> 05:11.500
And neither should you.

05:11.502 --> 05:12.902
Listen to yourself,

05:12.904 --> 05:14.336
you sound like one of Vega's dogs.

05:14.338 --> 05:16.705
Hey, I'm nobody's dog.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.574
I'm fighting to free my mother

05:18.576 --> 05:19.642
and avenge your father,

05:19.644 --> 05:21.377
who was killed by a human guard.

05:21.379 --> 05:23.679
While you stand on the sidelines.

05:23.681 --> 05:27.916
If you think I'm just
going to stand by and watch

05:27.918 --> 05:30.586
as you use my father's
death to justify murder,

05:30.588 --> 05:32.221
then you don't know me at all.

05:39.729 --> 05:41.730
Officials have confirmed

05:41.732 --> 05:43.832
that the Red Hawks were behind last night's

05:43.834 --> 05:45.500
failed attack on the sector.

05:45.502 --> 05:48.203
Now the question on
everybody's mind today is,

05:48.205 --> 05:50.105
who are the leaders of
this newly designated

05:50.107 --> 05:51.840
terrorist organization?

05:51.842 --> 05:53.642
Hey.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.712
Do you know anything about this
attack on the sector last night?

05:56.714 --> 05:58.180
No.

05:58.182 --> 06:00.749
No, those Red Hawks must have gone rogue.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.085
My parents don't encourage violence

06:03.087 --> 06:06.121
to get their message across.

06:06.123 --> 06:07.856
Emery...

06:09.859 --> 06:12.227
I don't condone my parents'
feelings about the Atrians,

06:12.229 --> 06:14.229
but they're still my parents.

06:14.231 --> 06:16.731
And there's still some good left in them.

06:16.733 --> 06:19.000
Like their charity ball.

06:19.002 --> 06:21.469
A... about that, I don't think
it's a good idea for me to go.

06:21.471 --> 06:22.904
Or the Atrians.

06:22.906 --> 06:24.906
How can you even be
sure it's gonna be safe?

06:24.908 --> 06:26.374
My dad's a councilman.

06:26.376 --> 06:29.411
And he's considering running for congress.

06:29.413 --> 06:31.646
I promise you, tomorrow
night's only controversy

06:31.648 --> 06:34.049
will involve the words "crab" and "dip."

06:34.051 --> 06:36.451
And...

06:36.453 --> 06:39.554
It would really mean a lot
to me to have you by my side.

06:42.425 --> 06:45.360
I got to go talk to Julia.

06:45.362 --> 06:46.995
Wha... what about the ball?

06:46.997 --> 06:49.898
I'll let you know.

06:55.739 --> 06:58.673
I have some intel I need
you to give Vega asap. _

06:58.675 --> 07:00.475
What am I, your messenger boy now?

07:00.477 --> 07:02.176
Oh, but this is a message I think

07:02.178 --> 07:04.278
you'll really enjoy delivering.

07:08.351 --> 07:09.384
Grayson's parents?

07:09.386 --> 07:12.387
Yeah.

07:12.389 --> 07:15.389
I used to think that
Grayson was kind of vanilla.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.692
But now I see it's all a part of his game.

07:17.694 --> 07:20.594
You know, I got to respect that...
I've got my cover, he's got his.

07:20.596 --> 07:22.730
But how do you know his
parents are the leaders?

07:22.732 --> 07:24.332
Because.

07:24.334 --> 07:27.535
Those two idiot Red Hawks
squealed like little piggies

07:27.537 --> 07:29.537
right before they went boom.

07:30.405 --> 07:31.839
That was you?

07:31.841 --> 07:33.007
You're welcome.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.410
All right, I'll give Vega the message.

07:36.412 --> 07:40.448
Zoe, good work on the fetal pig dissection.

07:40.450 --> 07:42.750
- Your incisions were very precise.
- Thanks, Ms. Benton.

07:42.752 --> 07:44.452
Are you gonna go to the charity ball?

07:44.454 --> 07:47.455
- You bet.
- Good, I'll see you there.

07:47.457 --> 07:49.023
You're actually gonna go to that thing?

07:49.025 --> 07:50.791
Yep, and so are you.

07:50.793 --> 07:53.661
As soon as you talk to Vega,
you're gonna meet me at the ball

07:53.663 --> 07:55.696
and give me her instructions.

07:55.698 --> 07:58.966
So get yourself a government-issued tux.

08:04.172 --> 08:06.941
There's something you're not telling me.

08:06.943 --> 08:09.209
What's the deal with you and Drake?

08:09.211 --> 08:10.978
There is no deal with me and Drake.

08:10.980 --> 08:12.513
I just saw you two talking.

08:12.515 --> 08:14.648
And you left the bug together on Saturday.

08:14.650 --> 08:16.050
Where did you go?

08:16.052 --> 08:18.652
Okay, he asked me to give
him a ride to Edendale,

08:18.654 --> 08:20.821
and I felt bad for him, so...

08:20.823 --> 08:23.490
Look, if you don't want me
to hang out with him, I won't.

08:23.492 --> 08:24.992
I know that you really like him.

08:24.994 --> 08:27.494
A momentary lapse in judgment

08:27.496 --> 08:29.763
I can only attribute to a hormonal shift

08:29.765 --> 08:31.932
and/or... sheer boredom.

08:31.934 --> 08:33.967
But if you wanted to
get with Drake, then...

08:33.969 --> 08:35.269
I don't.

08:35.270 --> 08:37.104
Honestly, the whole interspecies thing

08:37.106 --> 08:39.006
Really grosses me out.

08:41.009 --> 08:42.142
I have class.

08:42.144 --> 08:43.644
So talk later?

08:43.645 --> 08:45.746
Yeah.

08:47.548 --> 08:49.516
Roman saved me with cyper.

08:49.518 --> 08:51.318
If anyone finds out, I'm back to a life

08:51.320 --> 08:53.487
of tubes and needles, being
studied like a lab rat,

08:53.489 --> 08:55.188
- along with the Atrians.
- Stop.

08:55.190 --> 08:56.590
You're my best friend.

08:56.592 --> 08:58.225
I will never let that happen.

08:58.227 --> 09:00.060
Well, then what are we gonna do?

09:00.062 --> 09:03.263
I've got to find Bandell another story.

09:03.265 --> 09:05.132
Well, might I remind you
that you're already sitting

09:05.134 --> 09:06.733
on a story juicier than cyper?

09:06.735 --> 09:08.001
You know

09:08.003 --> 09:09.903
who the leaders of the Red Hawks are.

09:09.905 --> 09:11.872
I can't destroy Grayson's family like that.

09:11.874 --> 09:14.274
As hateful as his parents' beliefs are,

09:14.276 --> 09:17.010
I don't know if they've
done anything wrong.

09:17.012 --> 09:18.578
Em,

09:18.580 --> 09:19.946
you heard the news report.

09:19.948 --> 09:21.448
The Red Hawks just graduated

09:21.450 --> 09:23.383
from a hate group to a
terrorist organization.

09:23.385 --> 09:25.352
Consider it a public service.

09:25.354 --> 09:27.253
Who knows what they're gonna do next?

09:27.255 --> 09:30.557
Grayson assured me his parents
didn't order the attack.

09:30.559 --> 09:32.692
That doesn't change the fact
that they're Atrians, Em.

09:32.694 --> 09:35.795
You know what, even if you can get Bandell

09:35.797 --> 09:37.664
something better,

09:37.666 --> 09:39.866
who's to say he won't still
pursue the cyper story?

09:39.868 --> 09:42.969
I think I might have an idea.

09:42.971 --> 09:44.771
But while I go look for another story,

09:44.773 --> 09:46.105
I need you to talk to Lukas.

09:48.944 --> 09:51.511
You all right?

09:53.380 --> 09:55.315
I'm out.

09:55.317 --> 09:57.817
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:58.619 --> 10:01.287
Out of the Red Hawks?

10:01.289 --> 10:03.489
- For good?
- Yeah, man.

10:03.491 --> 10:04.791
Glad to hear it.

10:04.793 --> 10:06.259
I used to believe in what they stood for.

10:06.261 --> 10:07.794
But after last night

10:07.796 --> 10:09.862
and getting you arrested
and almost thrown in jail,

10:09.864 --> 10:11.531
it's not what I signed up for.

10:11.533 --> 10:14.333
You know Vartan's gonna
try and talk you out of it.

10:14.335 --> 10:17.404
I mean, you're their
inside man at Marshall High.

10:17.406 --> 10:19.605
Yeah. Let him. There's plenty
of other Red Hawks in this school

10:19.607 --> 10:21.007
who can take my place.

10:21.009 --> 10:23.509
I've made my decision.

10:24.945 --> 10:27.880
- And you believe him?
- I do.

10:27.882 --> 10:29.715
He told me he was out, but
they still want him to go

10:29.717 --> 10:31.784
to a Red Hawk meeting
tomorrow night after the ball.

10:31.786 --> 10:35.021
Last ditch effort to get him to stay.

10:36.089 --> 10:38.557
Eric's not perfect, but...

10:38.559 --> 10:40.659
He can admit when he's wrong.

10:42.529 --> 10:45.397
- What?
- It's just...

10:45.399 --> 10:48.834
You always choose to
see the good in people.

10:48.836 --> 10:50.269
I like that

10:50.271 --> 10:52.037
about you.

10:52.039 --> 10:53.873
Well, when you have parents like mine,

10:53.875 --> 10:56.342
it kind of becomes your default setting.

10:59.646 --> 11:03.882
I would be honored to be
your date to the charity ball.

11:03.884 --> 11:06.485
Yeah?

11:19.165 --> 11:21.233
Well, that explains it.

11:21.235 --> 11:22.401
What?

11:22.403 --> 11:24.136
Your constant defense of humans.

11:24.138 --> 11:25.337
You're hot for one of 'em.

11:27.374 --> 11:29.041
Emery's a friend.

11:29.043 --> 11:30.342
Come on.

11:30.344 --> 11:32.244
We may be in different worlds right now,

11:32.246 --> 11:34.346
but I've still known you my whole life.

11:35.982 --> 11:37.382
I wonder how you'd feel

11:37.384 --> 11:40.585
if you knew who your "friend" was dating.

11:40.587 --> 11:42.354
What are you talking about?

11:43.222 --> 11:45.023
Grayson's parents

11:45.025 --> 11:47.125
are the leaders of the Red Hawks.

11:48.561 --> 11:51.196
You don't believe me, do you?

11:51.198 --> 11:53.698
Look at me. Look at me.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.333
I'm telling you the truth.

11:55.335 --> 11:56.835
If that's the truth,

11:56.837 --> 11:58.336
then he's keeping it from Emery.

11:58.338 --> 12:00.338
She would never do anything like that.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.007
How much do you even know about her?

12:02.009 --> 12:04.009
She could be a Red Hawk,
too. Humans can't be trusted.

12:04.011 --> 12:06.478
Emery has been our biggest
supporter since day one.

12:06.480 --> 12:08.813
- Even you can see that.
- Hey.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.081
I have your invitation to the ball.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.283
Thank you. I'm...

12:11.285 --> 12:13.485
Looking forward to it.

12:16.088 --> 12:17.889
You're going to the Montroses' ball?

12:17.891 --> 12:19.324
Even after what you just told me?

12:19.326 --> 12:22.026
They invited us. I can't be rude.

12:22.028 --> 12:25.263
Vega's planning some sort of retribution,

12:25.265 --> 12:26.698
isn't she?

12:26.700 --> 12:28.767
Don't let it concern you.

12:28.769 --> 12:31.569
Yeah, well, it does concern me.
Because I'm gonna be there watching

12:31.571 --> 12:33.805
your every move.

12:33.807 --> 12:36.407
I'm your plus-one.

12:54.769 --> 12:58.438
Senator, Marshall has one
of the top athletic programs

12:58.440 --> 13:01.574
in the entire state. And these
donations will go a long way

13:01.576 --> 13:03.810
towards making sure that it stays that way.

13:03.812 --> 13:05.912
- Excuse me. Just one second, Senator.
- Sure.

13:07.214 --> 13:08.481
Welcome.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.717
I'm councilman Montrose.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.021
Roman.

13:16.925 --> 13:18.791
Yes, of course.

13:18.793 --> 13:20.760
Your sister swam with our son.

13:20.762 --> 13:23.563
Very impressive. I was
just trying to convince

13:23.565 --> 13:26.032
Senator Fatora here to open
that thick wallet of his

13:26.034 --> 13:28.501
to make a donation to the
Marshall scholarship fund.

13:28.503 --> 13:31.471
Gentlemen, tell me, uh,
what I can do to, uh,

13:31.473 --> 13:33.606
improve conditions in the sector.

13:33.608 --> 13:36.576
Uh, well, there's overcrowding
in the east quadrant...

13:36.578 --> 13:38.778
- Okay.
- Over here, please. Smile.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.749
A picture is worth a
thousand words, Senator.

13:42.751 --> 13:44.617
At the very least, a
couple of grand towards

13:44.619 --> 13:45.918
our scholarship fund.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.720
Wonderful to meet you two.

13:47.722 --> 13:49.455
Make yourselves comfortable.

13:49.457 --> 13:51.324
We're thrilled to have you in our home.

13:52.559 --> 13:54.527
You two clean up well.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.096
- Enjoy the party.
- Thanks, Ms. Benton.

13:58.165 --> 14:00.333
Yeah, that's easy for her to say.

14:00.335 --> 14:02.435
She's not being paraded
around these rich people

14:02.437 --> 14:04.337
like a bunch of monkeys.

14:04.339 --> 14:07.973
How do I know one of these
rich people isn't a hidden Trag

14:07.975 --> 14:09.942
here to help you with your plan?

14:09.944 --> 14:11.677
I know you're working with someone.

14:11.679 --> 14:13.579
Well, if you worried
a little less about me,

14:13.581 --> 14:16.749
you'd see who just came in.

14:39.172 --> 14:43.173
Emery, it's so wonderful
to see you. Come with me.

14:43.244 --> 14:45.244
I'd love to take you on a tour of our home.

14:45.246 --> 14:47.479
That would be great, Mrs. Montrose.

15:01.261 --> 15:04.162
- You talked to Vega?
- Yeah.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.197
What's this?

15:05.199 --> 15:06.431
A ransom note.

15:06.433 --> 15:07.833
Vega wants us

15:07.835 --> 15:09.568
to kidnap Grayson Montrose,

15:09.570 --> 15:11.737
take him across the ferry, and

15:11.739 --> 15:13.839
bring him to an abandoned
warehouse off of highway 32.

15:13.841 --> 15:16.241
You know where that is?
It's deep in the woods.

15:16.243 --> 15:18.176
We won't be spotted.
The Montroses have ties

15:18.178 --> 15:20.579
to the security firm
that operates the crate.

15:20.581 --> 15:23.148
The Trags will return Grayson
to his parents unharmed...

15:23.150 --> 15:25.351
In exchange for the release of prisoners?

15:25.353 --> 15:28.620
- Yeah.
- Tell me that one of them's my dad.

15:28.622 --> 15:30.422
And my mom.

15:30.424 --> 15:32.557
All this time...

15:32.559 --> 15:34.426
All this work, pretending
to be someone else,

15:34.428 --> 15:36.228
it's finally getting rewarded.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.896
I'm gonna get my dad back.

15:37.898 --> 15:40.398
Yeah, but one problem. How
are we gonna knock Grayson out

15:40.400 --> 15:42.567
and take him with us without
anybody at the party noticing?

15:42.569 --> 15:46.237
Oh, I have an idea.

15:46.239 --> 15:49.441
Meet me at the bar in an hour.

15:53.346 --> 15:55.346
Grayson started swimming when he was three.

15:55.348 --> 15:58.750
He was always trying to
be like his big brother.

15:58.752 --> 16:00.418
It's nice you guys are so close.

16:00.420 --> 16:02.620
Always have been.

16:02.622 --> 16:05.156
We learned to lean on one another.

16:05.158 --> 16:07.592
This is the last picture we
took of the four of us together.

16:07.594 --> 16:08.827
Grayson looks

16:08.829 --> 16:10.295
so much like his brother.

16:10.297 --> 16:12.564
Are you close with your family?

16:12.566 --> 16:15.500
We've helped each other
through some tough times.

16:15.502 --> 16:17.168
It's important that we stick with our own

16:17.170 --> 16:18.369
during times of need.

16:19.571 --> 16:22.840
You're very sweet.

16:22.842 --> 16:24.942
And I know that Grayson's been
spending a lot of time with you

16:24.944 --> 16:26.844
over these last few weeks.

16:26.846 --> 16:29.680
I'm happy he's found someone special,

16:29.682 --> 16:31.482
someone kind and honest

16:31.484 --> 16:33.384
who shares our family values.

16:33.386 --> 16:35.653
- Actually, you and I have...
- Mrs. Montrose.

16:35.655 --> 16:37.922
Yes. Senator Fatora
would like to grab a word

16:37.924 --> 16:39.423
with you later tonight

16:39.425 --> 16:41.159
to discuss the children's hospital event.

16:41.161 --> 16:44.395
That won't work. Remember,
I have that conflict.

16:44.397 --> 16:46.197
I'll see if I can grab him now.

16:46.199 --> 16:48.432
Excuse me.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.974
Emery Whitehill.

16:56.976 --> 16:59.143
What are you doing here?
I'm working the party

16:59.145 --> 17:01.145
for the Smatter Chatter.

17:01.147 --> 17:04.682
We're doing a spread on plastic
surgery among Edendale's elite.

17:04.684 --> 17:07.184
- Mmm.
- Slow news day. Speaking of,

17:07.185 --> 17:09.119
how's the digging going?

17:09.122 --> 17:12.356
Uh, I'll have something to you soon.

17:12.358 --> 17:17.261
Good. 'Cause, uh, ticktock,
the cyper clock is ticking.

17:19.798 --> 17:21.598
Bandell's here. Have you got it?

17:21.601 --> 17:24.300
It acts like a magnet.

17:24.303 --> 17:27.003
Lukas said if you place it
up against Bandell's tablet,

17:27.006 --> 17:29.073
it'll corrupt the file.

17:29.075 --> 17:32.343
Zap. No more cyper video.

17:32.345 --> 17:34.812
Sure you wouldn't rather just
give Bandell the Montrose story?

17:34.814 --> 17:37.414
I can't destroy Grayson's family.

17:37.416 --> 17:40.150
I just need to get close enough
to Bandell to destroy the video.

17:40.152 --> 17:41.819
What if this doesn't work, Em?

17:41.821 --> 17:44.555
Is there anything you can give
Bandell without hurting Grayson?

17:50.929 --> 17:53.630
Grayson told me Eric's going
to a Red Hawk meeting later.

17:53.632 --> 17:56.533
If Bandell is able to catch
them talking about the attack

17:56.535 --> 17:59.202
on video, then that
could be a huge exclusive.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.405
That's perfect. Where's the meeting?

18:01.407 --> 18:02.706
I don't know.

18:02.708 --> 18:06.310
But... that's where you come in.

18:06.312 --> 18:09.079
You want me to find out from Eric?

18:09.081 --> 18:11.081
He'll never talk to me.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.016
He punches things.

18:13.018 --> 18:15.719
Like, all the time. And
he doesn't even know me.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.420
You're clever.

18:17.422 --> 18:18.722
You'll figure something out. But go.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.493
What... what do I do?

18:23.495 --> 18:24.995
Make something up.

19:03.033 --> 19:05.068
Roman.

19:05.070 --> 19:07.237
Can I help you with something?
The bar is not back here.

19:07.239 --> 19:09.039
I'm looking for Emery

19:09.041 --> 19:11.908
Oh, she's, uh, taking a tour
around the house with my mom.

19:11.910 --> 19:14.277
She deserves to know the truth,

19:14.279 --> 19:15.545
don't you think?

19:15.547 --> 19:17.547
- The truth about what?
- You.

19:17.549 --> 19:19.282
And your parents.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.417
I'm not sure I follow.

19:21.419 --> 19:22.852
I think you do.

19:24.856 --> 19:27.857
- Get out of my house, Roman.
- You know, it's funny.

19:27.859 --> 19:30.726
I seem to remember you being
in my pod without permission.

19:30.728 --> 19:33.729
Was that part of some Red
Hawk plan to bug the place?

19:33.731 --> 19:37.400
I think we both know
what this is really about.

19:37.402 --> 19:39.435
We do.

19:39.437 --> 19:42.104
You being a fraud.

19:42.106 --> 19:43.372
No.

19:43.374 --> 19:45.141
I have something you want.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.111
What's going on?

19:49.946 --> 19:51.914
Go ahead.

19:51.916 --> 19:53.749
Tell her.

19:53.751 --> 19:55.718
Emery, Grayson's been lying
to you this whole time.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.086
His parents

19:57.088 --> 19:58.921
are the leaders of the Red Hawks.

20:16.860 --> 20:19.494
Roman, you don't understand!
Grayson isn't a Red Hawk,

20:19.496 --> 20:21.595
and if I thought his parents
were gonna be a threat to you

20:21.597 --> 20:23.597
or any other Atrian at the
party, I would have told.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.400
The Red Hawks protest every
day at the sector gates,

20:25.402 --> 20:27.235
reminding my people how
we're not wanted here.

20:27.237 --> 20:29.905
They left a doll with a knife
stuck in it for my sister.

20:29.907 --> 20:31.940
They tried to blow up the sector yesterday.

20:31.942 --> 20:34.375
You knew who the leaders were,

20:34.377 --> 20:36.344
and you didn't think to tell me? Why?

20:36.346 --> 20:37.845
Because of Grayson?

20:37.847 --> 20:39.915
- It's not that simple.
- Emery,

20:39.917 --> 20:41.616
if the Red Hawks had been successful,

20:41.618 --> 20:44.620
do you know how many
Atrians could have died?

20:44.622 --> 20:45.921
Do you even care?

20:45.923 --> 20:49.625
No! You do not get to just walk away!

20:49.627 --> 20:52.027
I have been fighting
for you and the Atrians

20:52.029 --> 20:53.629
ever since you showed up.

20:53.631 --> 20:55.397
You know that.

20:55.399 --> 20:57.533
Grayson can't help who his parents are.

20:58.887 --> 21:00.135
But at least he's honest with me,

21:00.137 --> 21:01.470
and he's there for me.

21:01.472 --> 21:04.106
With him, I know where I stand.

21:04.108 --> 21:06.608
You want to be angry with me? Fine.

21:06.610 --> 21:09.978
All you ever do is push me
away and act like I don't exist,

21:09.980 --> 21:12.614
so, really, it's not that big of a deal.

21:13.762 --> 21:16.096
Do you think that's what I want?

21:16.098 --> 21:18.198
Do you think it doesn't kill me

21:18.200 --> 21:20.300
every time I have to walk away from you?

21:20.302 --> 21:22.068
Then why?

21:22.070 --> 21:23.937
I told you.

21:23.939 --> 21:26.673
I have been telling you.
It's to keep you safe.

21:26.675 --> 21:28.241
And I told you,

21:28.243 --> 21:30.377
I don't need protecting.

21:30.379 --> 21:31.745
Yes, you do.

21:31.747 --> 21:33.179
There are Atrians out there

21:33.181 --> 21:36.316
that would kill you if they had the chance.

21:38.152 --> 21:42.856
Every day, I am fighting to
make sure that never happens.

21:42.858 --> 21:45.458
I don't know how long it will take,

21:45.460 --> 21:47.494
but I do know that I can't ask you

21:47.496 --> 21:50.363
to wait for a day that might never come.

21:51.832 --> 21:55.201
I would give you everything.

21:57.438 --> 22:00.039
Just not now.

22:09.149 --> 22:12.418
I'm thinking we should call
time of death on this party.

22:12.420 --> 22:15.655
I heard there's a chop-socky
anime double feature in town.

22:15.657 --> 22:18.024
If we leave now, we could still make it.

22:18.026 --> 22:19.992
I can't. I got a thing after this.

22:19.994 --> 22:22.328
Well, then, maybe you could give me a ride.

22:22.330 --> 22:24.430
Um, I'm going southside,

22:24.432 --> 22:27.233
and the movieplex is on the
other side of town, so...

22:27.235 --> 22:29.769
Southside? That's totally sketchy.

22:29.771 --> 22:32.772
The only reason people go there is to...

22:32.774 --> 22:34.707
Wait. Is that what you're doing?

22:34.709 --> 22:37.309
- You're going to buy drugs?
- What?! No!

22:37.311 --> 22:38.844
'Cause I was in the hospital

22:38.846 --> 22:40.680
when they brought in this
guy who was all messed up

22:40.682 --> 22:42.715
from a drug deal gone
sideways on the southside.

22:42.717 --> 22:45.151
I'm not buy... I'm not buying drugs, okay?

22:45.553 --> 22:47.186
I'm meeting some people
at the old point bar,

22:47.188 --> 22:48.921
which is miles away from
anywhere that you want to be.

22:48.923 --> 22:51.991
So if you need a ride,
just try someone else.

22:54.461 --> 22:57.563
Did Roman say how he
found out about my parents?

22:57.565 --> 23:00.232
No, he didn't.

23:00.234 --> 23:02.835
Grayson, listen, you're a good guy.

23:02.837 --> 23:05.504
And I wanted to believe it doesn't matter

23:05.506 --> 23:08.207
who your parents are, but it does.

23:08.209 --> 23:09.909
I wish I could change that, but I can't.

23:09.911 --> 23:11.477
Are you sure?

23:11.479 --> 23:13.679
I had a talk with your
mom, and it's obvious

23:13.681 --> 23:14.880
that you mean the world to her.

23:14.882 --> 23:16.515
If you stand up to your parents

23:16.517 --> 23:18.117
and tell them how you really feel,

23:18.119 --> 23:20.452
it could make a difference.

23:20.454 --> 23:22.955
Look, not really that simple, okay?

23:22.957 --> 23:25.190
Sorry. It's Julia.

23:25.192 --> 23:26.592
I need to find her.

23:26.594 --> 23:28.861
Em... Emery?

23:28.863 --> 23:30.496
- Emery?
- Hey.

23:30.498 --> 23:34.466
I got the bartender to
sneak me a shot or two.

23:34.468 --> 23:37.970
You want one?

23:42.008 --> 23:43.642
Oh.

23:45.479 --> 23:47.012
Slow down there, boy.

23:47.014 --> 23:49.014
That's strong.

23:49.016 --> 23:51.416
What's in that?

23:51.418 --> 23:53.318
Ah, just something special,

23:53.320 --> 23:55.954
just for you.

23:57.023 --> 24:00.559
Aw, how are you feeling?

24:00.561 --> 24:03.261
You worthless, pathetic human.

24:03.263 --> 24:05.297
What did you do to him?

24:05.299 --> 24:07.165
I drugged him.

24:07.167 --> 24:09.467
He looks awake, but
inside, it's lights out,

24:09.469 --> 24:12.704
so we got to get him to my car, fast.

24:15.841 --> 24:20.879
Handle her, and keep
your pants on this time.

24:20.881 --> 24:22.547
Zoe, I need to have a talk with...

24:22.549 --> 24:24.683
Oh, whoa, whoa, where
are you going, beautiful?

24:24.685 --> 24:26.851
- Beautiful?
- Yeah.

24:26.853 --> 24:29.320
Really? That's the best you can do?

24:29.322 --> 24:32.390
After we hooked up, then you ignore me

24:32.392 --> 24:35.960
and start hanging out with my best friend.

24:35.962 --> 24:38.997
Nobody is ignoring you, all right?

24:38.999 --> 24:40.832
At least not in that dress.

24:43.336 --> 24:48.072
Do you want me to give
you a tour of the house?

24:48.074 --> 24:50.275
It has eight bedrooms.

24:50.277 --> 24:51.676
I...

24:51.678 --> 24:54.245
I'd love to, but, um...

24:54.247 --> 24:56.881
Some other time, okay?

25:06.914 --> 25:10.049
Drake?

25:20.871 --> 25:22.374
_

25:22.399 --> 25:27.399
_

25:46.788 --> 25:49.655
Mr. and Mrs. Montrose, we have your son.

25:49.657 --> 25:52.825
If you want to see him again,
you will use your influence

25:52.827 --> 25:55.761
to secure the release of
these five Atrian prisoners

25:55.763 --> 25:57.563
from the crate.

25:57.565 --> 26:00.066
If you refuse or alert the authorities,

26:00.068 --> 26:02.201
we will reveal your true identities

26:02.203 --> 26:04.537
as leaders of the Red Hawks,

26:04.539 --> 26:08.674
and you will get your son
back one piece at a time.

26:16.016 --> 26:18.651
- Can I talk you?
- What?

26:20.153 --> 26:22.354
You can't go to the Red
Hawk meeting tonight.

26:22.356 --> 26:24.056
How do you even know about that?

26:24.058 --> 26:26.458
The Red Hawks are going
to take a hit tonight.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.527
You don't want to get caught up in it.

26:28.529 --> 26:30.963
I don't know. I...

26:30.965 --> 26:33.532
Trust me.

26:34.567 --> 26:36.969
Okay.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.404
I won't go.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.709
In my line of work, you see everything.

26:43.711 --> 26:47.346
All the dirty little
secrets people try to hide.

26:47.348 --> 26:50.716
The things I could tell you.

26:50.718 --> 26:53.418
I got a story about the Atrians

26:53.420 --> 26:56.421
that would blow your mind.

26:56.423 --> 27:00.592
Your very attractive, hot little mind.

27:00.594 --> 27:03.161
- That right?
- Mm-hmm.

27:03.163 --> 27:04.830
Mr. Bandell?

27:04.832 --> 27:06.231
Sorry to interrupt.

27:06.233 --> 27:08.900
Uh, can I speak to you for a second?

27:08.902 --> 27:11.303
To be continued.

27:11.305 --> 27:13.038
This better be worth it.

27:26.585 --> 27:29.254
Roman knows who I am.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.891
If he blows my cover, you
have to take care of him.

27:32.893 --> 27:36.594
What does that mean?

27:36.596 --> 27:38.997
He's my friend.

27:38.999 --> 27:41.366
You're a Trag.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.067
You don't have friends.

27:43.069 --> 27:44.502
You have the cause.

27:44.504 --> 27:47.105
Remember that.

28:07.864 --> 28:10.165
My drone cameras have every angle

28:10.167 --> 28:12.701
inside and outside the bar.

28:14.437 --> 28:16.972
I had my doubts about you, buttercup.

28:16.974 --> 28:20.941
But finding out about a
secret Red Hawk meeting?

28:20.945 --> 28:22.511
Nice job.

28:22.513 --> 28:25.013
You might have a future in my line of work.

28:25.015 --> 28:26.849
I'll pass.

28:47.971 --> 28:49.604
What is he doing?

28:49.606 --> 28:54.209
Drake, I know what your
plan is. This is crazy.

28:54.211 --> 28:56.711
We got to get Grayson
back before it's too late.

28:56.713 --> 28:57.979
Don't do anything.

28:57.981 --> 28:59.381
All right, let me talk to him.

28:59.383 --> 29:00.515
There's no time.

29:02.419 --> 29:03.952
Hey!

29:03.954 --> 29:05.687
No! No!

29:09.351 --> 29:15.119
Easy, Grayson, here.

29:15.176 --> 29:16.709
You sure you're all right?

29:16.711 --> 29:18.444
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

29:18.446 --> 29:20.379
All right, set him here.
Set him down. Set him down.

29:24.919 --> 29:25.986
What did you do to him?

29:26.011 --> 29:28.511
Zoe put something in his drink. He's fine.

29:28.513 --> 29:30.280
He's been drugged and
kidnapped. He's not fine.

29:31.815 --> 29:33.983
Hey!

29:34.235 --> 29:35.535
What were you thinking, huh?

29:35.605 --> 29:38.404
You have any idea what
would happen to our people

29:38.406 --> 29:39.739
if the humans found out about this?

29:39.741 --> 29:41.107
I'm doing this for our people!

29:41.898 --> 29:43.297
The Trags are fighting for our freedom.

29:43.299 --> 29:45.399
We were going to get Atrians
released from the crate.

29:45.401 --> 29:47.001
We were going to get my mother!

29:48.619 --> 29:49.986
- Hey.
- Roman.

29:49.988 --> 29:51.254
The Trags can't find out about this, okay?

29:51.256 --> 29:52.388
You need to go.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.256
I'll tell 'em it was an accident.

29:53.258 --> 29:54.691
- Hey.
- You need to go, Roman, now.

29:55.693 --> 29:57.860
- Zoe, put the gun down.
- I've got a better idea.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.897
You're gonna do everything
I say, or your friend dies.

30:04.501 --> 30:06.536
Now they're in our town...

30:06.538 --> 30:07.804
Fraternizing...

30:07.806 --> 30:11.107
Blah, blah, blah. Give
me something I can use.

30:11.109 --> 30:14.343
We are not going to
stand for these tatties...

30:14.345 --> 30:17.113
Kill all of 'em!

30:17.115 --> 30:18.414
... Threatening our families.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.583
Damn it.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.786
Got to fix the feed out back.

30:48.712 --> 30:50.946
Are the screens coming back up?

30:50.948 --> 30:53.415
Nope.

31:00.123 --> 31:03.158
Then it's got to be something in the van.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.328
Sometimes it's something real simple.

31:09.699 --> 31:12.468
Ah. There's the culprit.

31:13.603 --> 31:16.905
No we are not gonna put up

31:16.907 --> 31:19.208
with these Atrians...

31:19.210 --> 31:21.543
Threatening our families,

31:21.545 --> 31:23.679
our safety, our way of life!

31:23.681 --> 31:24.713
Yeah! Yeah!

31:24.715 --> 31:27.216
To help us lay out our plan,

31:27.218 --> 31:29.251
we got a real special guest tonight.

31:34.108 --> 31:35.190
Is that Margaret Montrose?

31:35.192 --> 31:38.126
For those of you who don't know,

31:38.128 --> 31:40.929
I am the grand matriarch of the Red Hawks.

31:40.931 --> 31:43.298
I know these have been trying times

31:43.300 --> 31:44.633
for many of you,

31:44.635 --> 31:45.901
with all the attention

31:45.903 --> 31:47.736
from the authorities and the press.

31:48.807 --> 31:51.807
Lesser men might have been
tempted to give up the fight.

31:51.832 --> 31:52.908
No way!

31:52.909 --> 31:55.110
That's why I'm here tonight...

31:55.112 --> 31:57.946
So you can see who I am...

31:57.948 --> 32:00.582
And see that I am not afraid.

32:00.584 --> 32:04.319
I know I can count on my
loyal soldiers to protect

32:04.321 --> 32:05.387
my identity.

32:05.389 --> 32:06.721
Yeah! Right!

32:06.723 --> 32:08.890
And to carry out our mission

32:08.892 --> 32:11.359
to destroy the Atrians.

32:11.361 --> 32:15.597
We had a setback, but
it will not hold us back.

32:15.599 --> 32:20.468
Even as I speak, we're
amassing more explosives.

32:20.470 --> 32:22.137
Soon we will attack

32:22.139 --> 32:23.938
the Atrians with twice the force...

32:23.940 --> 32:25.473
Not just in their market,

32:25.475 --> 32:28.143
but where they live and sleep:

32:28.145 --> 32:30.211
In their pods.

32:32.649 --> 32:35.917
I can't believe it.

32:35.919 --> 32:37.785
The wife of councilman
Montrose calling the shots

32:37.787 --> 32:39.687
on a terrorist attack?

32:39.689 --> 32:41.522
You were right.

32:41.524 --> 32:44.959
It's a hell of a story.

32:44.961 --> 32:47.528
You told us you'd spare
us if we did what you said.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.629
Aw.

32:48.631 --> 32:50.431
Are you feeling let down?

32:50.999 --> 32:52.166
Betrayed?

32:52.168 --> 32:54.435
Now you know how I feel.

32:56.772 --> 32:59.239
You let me down, Drake.

32:59.275 --> 33:03.508
You broke the Trag code,
so now you have to die.

33:03.513 --> 33:05.413
And Roman witnessed our plan, so...

33:05.415 --> 33:07.715
He has to die, too.

33:14.822 --> 33:18.825
Wait. Think about this. I can help you.

33:18.825 --> 33:20.391
My Uncle is iksen.

33:20.395 --> 33:21.728
- Shut up!
- I've got connections.

33:24.966 --> 33:27.567
We should kill her. If we don't,

33:27.569 --> 33:30.804
she could tell the Trags, and
they'll come after both of us.

33:30.806 --> 33:33.039
We can't do this.

33:33.041 --> 33:35.442
Yeah, maybe you can't. I'm a warrior.

33:35.444 --> 33:37.711
Warriors protect Atrian lives.

33:37.713 --> 33:40.246
Whether we like it or not, she's one of us.

33:46.188 --> 33:48.354
Drake, don't.

33:48.356 --> 33:51.257
You just signed your own death sentences.

33:51.259 --> 33:52.292
And for what?

33:52.294 --> 33:53.560
For a human?

33:53.562 --> 33:56.196
You think you saved Grayson?

33:56.198 --> 33:59.199
You know that you just
put off the inevitable.

33:59.201 --> 34:01.100
Enjoy your time with your humans, boys.

34:01.102 --> 34:03.603
Their days are numbered.

34:09.760 --> 34:12.594
We got to get Grayson back now.

34:12.597 --> 34:13.831
What are we gonna tell him?

34:13.833 --> 34:15.733
Tell him we found him
on the front lawn, drunk.

34:15.734 --> 34:17.400
He's not gonna remember anything.

34:22.007 --> 34:23.438
Well, you might as well go

34:23.440 --> 34:24.908
for your human girl.

34:24.909 --> 34:26.708
We're all gonna be dead soon.

34:33.018 --> 34:35.385
I landed my biggest story

34:35.387 --> 34:38.888
and the hottest chick at
the party in the same night.

34:38.889 --> 34:42.023
I'd say I'm having a
good day. How about it?

34:42.027 --> 34:43.793
Call me when you get a peabody.

34:43.795 --> 34:44.927
No, I'm serious.

34:44.929 --> 34:47.228
This Red Hawk story is just the beginning.

34:47.232 --> 34:49.098
I got big things on the horizon.

34:49.100 --> 34:51.266
Hey, what about that cyper
story you were going on about?

34:51.268 --> 34:52.568
Oh, that.

34:52.570 --> 34:54.270
Nah, some-some kind of glitch.

34:54.272 --> 34:56.405
Video got corrupted.

34:56.407 --> 34:57.974
Oh. What was on the recording?

34:57.976 --> 34:59.342
Two girls from Marshall High

34:59.344 --> 35:01.978
talking about how one of them got saved

35:01.980 --> 35:04.447
by an Atrian using cyper.

35:04.449 --> 35:07.984
These girls, what were their names?

35:11.254 --> 35:13.122
We're not gonna stand for this!

35:13.124 --> 35:15.957
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We're right behind you.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.827
Dad, what's going on?

35:17.829 --> 35:20.430
Some reporter taped a Red Hawk
meeting, and your mother was there.

35:20.432 --> 35:22.531
She's being charged with
planning a terrorist attack.

35:22.533 --> 35:24.400
We need to get down to the police station

35:24.402 --> 35:27.101
to put up a united front for your mother.

35:28.705 --> 35:31.607
I am the grand matriarch of the Red Hawk.

35:34.278 --> 35:35.978
Saw the news.

35:35.980 --> 35:37.313
Nice job.

35:37.315 --> 35:38.714
I guess.

35:38.716 --> 35:41.450
Everyone knows the Montroses are Red Hawks,

35:41.452 --> 35:43.152
and no one knows about cyper.

35:43.154 --> 35:44.586
That's win-win, right?

35:44.588 --> 35:46.522
It doesn't feel that way.

35:46.524 --> 35:49.289
I blew Grayson's whole world apart.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.727
I went over to his house
last night to try to warn him,

35:51.729 --> 35:53.629
but he was already asleep.

35:53.631 --> 35:57.599
So you'll be there to pick up
the pieces when he wakes up.

35:57.601 --> 35:59.768
That's the thing.

35:59.770 --> 36:01.904
I don't know if I can be there for Grayson,

36:01.906 --> 36:04.306
at least in the way he wants me to be.

36:06.576 --> 36:08.944
Roman and I talked last night.

36:08.946 --> 36:12.114
About... ?

36:12.116 --> 36:14.616
He said he wants to be with me,

36:14.618 --> 36:16.184
but he can't, and it's complicated,

36:16.186 --> 36:18.487
but I believe him.

36:20.123 --> 36:21.990
And maybe I'm a terrible
person for feeling this way,

36:21.992 --> 36:24.226
but I'd rather have "someday" with Roman

36:24.228 --> 36:26.661
than "now" with Grayson

36:26.663 --> 36:28.063
or anyone else.

36:28.065 --> 36:30.565
What did Roman do when you told him?

36:31.501 --> 36:32.901
I haven't told him yet.

36:32.903 --> 36:35.871
Okay, if you leave now,
you can be at the gate

36:35.873 --> 36:37.806
when the Atrian seven
are let out of the sector.

36:43.145 --> 36:45.080
Grayson.

36:46.148 --> 36:49.317
I'm just gonna let you two talk.

36:49.319 --> 36:50.986
Call me later.

36:50.988 --> 36:52.854
See you, Grayson.

36:52.856 --> 36:55.256
I heard about your mom. I'm so sorry.

36:59.395 --> 37:01.563
They lied to me.

37:03.065 --> 37:06.167
They told me that they didn't...

37:06.169 --> 37:08.069
Know anything about the violence

37:08.071 --> 37:11.039
the Red Hawks were
involved in, but they did.

37:11.041 --> 37:14.042
And you were right.

37:16.078 --> 37:18.246
I had to take a stand.

37:24.453 --> 37:27.322
My dad wanted me to be a
part of this press conference

37:27.324 --> 37:29.857
to spin the story.

37:29.859 --> 37:31.693
And I wouldn't do it.

37:31.695 --> 37:34.062
Are you all right?

37:36.231 --> 37:38.433
No.

37:39.435 --> 37:41.068
I just...

37:41.070 --> 37:43.271
I don't know what to do. I...

37:43.273 --> 37:46.374
I just know that I can't
be in my house right now.

37:46.376 --> 37:49.977
And I didn't know where else to go.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.758
So, where are you headed?

38:15.760 --> 38:17.927
Not far.
