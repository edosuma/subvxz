28:52.618 --> 28:54.819
Safer to run, far as I can...

28:54.820 --> 28:56.086
You're safe here.

28:56.789 --> 28:58.256
Chang dead.

28:58.257 --> 28:59.689
More Sze Yup to come.

29:02.227 --> 29:03.827
They'll leave the same as Chang.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.733
You've seen me now.

29:11.570 --> 29:12.936
The man that I am.

29:18.010 --> 29:20.143
You've seen me long time ago.

29:44.670 --> 29:46.002
Stop here.

31:25.437 --> 31:27.270
You went to see Chang's whore.

31:28.807 --> 31:30.840
Wai-Ling was Chang's slave.

31:34.112 --> 31:35.679
She gave you up to him.

31:37.449 --> 31:39.317
Chang take her life,

31:39.318 --> 31:42.018
her freedom, her honor.

31:43.689 --> 31:45.455
She give up much more than me.

31:56.969 --> 31:58.468
I owned slaves.

32:19.958 --> 32:21.391
I can't shake it, Mei.

32:43.582 --> 32:44.898
I see you.

32:47.252 --> 32:48.485
You good.

32:55.610 --> 32:56.826
(SOFTLY) You good.

32:59.236 --> 33:00.469
You good.

35:07.692 --> 35:09.893
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

35:50.123 --> 35:52.124
You don't leave this
room until I get back.

35:54.221 --> 35:55.186
Mei?

35:58.303 --> 35:59.269
You hear me?

36:02.507 --> 36:03.773
It never stop.

36:04.443 --> 36:06.476
(CLEARS THROAT) Well, it stops now.

36:15.687 --> 36:16.853
This life mine.

36:17.389 --> 36:18.922
I no want for you.

36:19.624 --> 36:20.857
(EXHALES)

36:24.096 --> 36:25.028
(WHISPERS) Mei.

36:29.234 --> 36:33.169
I told you I lost everybody I ever had.

36:34.272 --> 36:36.272
All right. That was a lie.

36:37.642 --> 36:39.342
The people I loved,

36:40.078 --> 36:41.478
I didn't lose them.

36:42.814 --> 36:43.947
I let 'em go.

36:46.852 --> 36:49.519
But as soon as I got that
telegram from you, I knew...

36:51.356 --> 36:52.288
(SIGHS)

36:53.458 --> 36:54.541
Mei...

36:58.180 --> 36:59.395
I love you.

37:15.630 --> 37:16.980
I love you, Cullen.

37:22.988 --> 37:24.287
Lock the door.

37:59.291 --> 38:00.690
COLLIS: Mr. Bohannon,

38:02.127 --> 38:06.930
this is General Lee Yong, with the
Sze Yup Company in San Francisco.

38:08.033 --> 38:10.867
He has just informed me that
Mr. Chang has been murdered.

38:21.213 --> 38:23.079
(SPEAKING IN CANTONESE)

38:27.719 --> 38:30.753
Mr. Chang was tracking a
runaway whore in Washoe City

38:31.223 --> 38:33.756
when he and his men were
gunned down in cold blood.

38:36.394 --> 38:37.727
White assassin.

38:41.366 --> 38:43.032
I may know the man responsible.

38:47.038 --> 38:50.139
A white assassin came to town and
killed my foreman a few months back,

38:51.176 --> 38:52.675
shot him point blank in Chinatown.

38:53.445 --> 38:54.811
Maybe it was the same guy.

38:56.982 --> 38:59.115
Y'all fight wars to keep
your whores, right?

38:59.351 --> 39:01.184
(SPEAKING IN CANTONESE)

39:03.188 --> 39:07.390
Perhaps Chang's death was due to a
dispute over the value of this woman.

39:12.998 --> 39:16.400
Please inform the General the Central
Pacific hopes that Mr. Chang's death

39:16.401 --> 39:20.136
doesn't need to interrupt a long business
relationship between our companies.

39:22.807 --> 39:23.773
(MUTTERS)

39:26.077 --> 39:29.913
You wouldn't jeopardize your entire
business for one man, would you?

39:31.750 --> 39:32.899
(CHUCKLES)

39:33.485 --> 39:35.301
(SPEAKING IN CANTONESE)

39:41.393 --> 39:45.194
The General says the Sze Yup's services
will continue without interruption.

39:45.997 --> 39:49.300
He will send one of his
best company men, Ling Lee.

39:49.301 --> 39:50.501
He speak English?

39:50.502 --> 39:53.403
You'll find him of equal use
and value to you as Mr. Chang.

39:54.639 --> 39:55.806
COLLIS: Ah, it's truly a shame.

39:55.807 --> 39:58.541
Mr. Chang was a
forward-thinking businessman.

40:01.179 --> 40:02.245
Chang pimp.

40:02.764 --> 40:04.247
Taiping rebel.

40:04.482 --> 40:05.715
Nothing more.

40:10.021 --> 40:11.220
(DOOR CLOSES)

40:11.556 --> 40:14.024
Half our workforce could've
walked out that door just now.

40:14.025 --> 40:15.793
General himself says
Chang can be replaced.

40:15.794 --> 40:16.910
(SOFTLY) Yeah.

40:16.911 --> 40:18.861
You said the same thing three days ago.

40:20.131 --> 40:21.564
Now, here we stand

40:22.267 --> 40:24.217
learning Chang has been dispensed of.

40:25.603 --> 40:26.903
Three days you were out of town.

40:31.977 --> 40:35.411
You wanna ask me something, best ask.

40:40.819 --> 40:42.518
Did you have a hand in Chang's murder?

41:09.414 --> 41:10.546
