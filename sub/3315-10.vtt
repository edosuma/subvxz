00:01.001 --> 00:02.794
CONSTANCE: Ladies and gentlemen, the ham.

00:05.380 --> 00:06.924
-LARRY: Ah.
-(chuckles)

00:07.007 --> 00:09.259
Wow. It looks lovely.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.764
Now, who wants to say grace?

00:13.847 --> 00:16.892
-Oh, Mother, may I?
-LARRY: Of course, son.

00:16.975 --> 00:20.812
I was hoping you would choose
to become a part of this family.

00:26.527 --> 00:30.280
Dear God, thank you for this salty pig
meat we are about to eat,

00:30.364 --> 00:32.699
along with the rest
of the indigestible swill.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.701
And thank you for
our new charade of a family.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.828
My father ran away when I was only six.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.873
If I'd have known any better,
I would have joined him.

00:39.957 --> 00:41.041
And, also, because she's been trying to

00:41.124 --> 00:43.252
get back into this house
ever since she lost it,

00:43.335 --> 00:48.340
Lord, a big thank you for blinding
the asshole that's doing my mother

00:48.924 --> 00:51.468
so that he can't see what everybody knows.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.554
She doesn't really love him.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.681
Amen.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.808
(chuckling)

00:58.350 --> 01:01.562
Now, Tate, I know that you've had
a hard time making the adjustment,

01:01.645 --> 01:06.191
with all the recent changes,
moving back in here after the,

01:06.275 --> 01:07.943
the tragedy that
my own family went through.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.696
They burned themselves alive
after you were cheating

01:10.821 --> 01:13.323
on your wife with Constance, Lawrence.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.409
That... That was nobody's fault.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.787
Passion drove her to it.
One day, you'll understand.

01:18.871 --> 01:23.834
There are sacrifices you have to make
in the name of love.

01:23.917 --> 01:30.007
On a lighter note, I have reserved tickets
for everybody, for Saturday,

01:30.090 --> 01:35.888
at our community theater,
for the opening night of <i>Brigadoon.</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:39.766
I'm delighted to be
debuting in the chorus.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.937
Well, I, for one,
shall be there with bells on.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.691
Thank you, darling,
for being so supportive and encouraging.

01:47.774 --> 01:51.653
You have allowed me to explore
another facet of myself.

01:51.737 --> 01:54.615
-Yay! I love the theater.
-Don't, Addy!

01:54.698 --> 01:57.075
You're a smart girl.
You know he killed our brother.

01:57.159 --> 02:01.705
Stop it! Beau died
in his slumber of natural causes.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.292
Now you know he had a respiratory ailment.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.836
Your brother's in a better place.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.922
He suffered with
every breath that he took.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.174
He only suffered because of you.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.092
(chuckles)

02:14.176 --> 02:16.845
You know, Tate, unlike your siblings,

02:16.929 --> 02:20.140
you were graced with so many gifts.

02:20.224 --> 02:22.809
How is it that you can't bring yourself
to use them?

02:22.893 --> 02:27.022
Just a smile, or a kind word,

02:27.105 --> 02:29.024
could open the gates to heaven.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.363
No matter how much you want it,

02:35.447 --> 02:38.617
I will never be your perfect son.

Tate, what are you doing here?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.691
-Shouldn't you be in school?
-I'm going right after.

03:53.150 --> 03:54.526
After what?

03:58.238 --> 04:04.203
Oh! Oh, oh, ah! Oh, God! Oh!

(softly) Hi. How you doing?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.828
Viv, I owe you a very big apology.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.915
I don't want you to apologize.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.335
I just want you to leave.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.754
I've been doing a lot of thinking
while I've been in here.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.965
I think you're the one that's crazy.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.717
I really mean that.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.218
Vivien,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.555
I know

05:46.638 --> 05:48.223
you're telling the truth.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.519
-You were raped.
-(sighs)

05:53.896 --> 05:57.900
Who or what has brought you
to that conclusion?

05:57.983 --> 05:59.651
Because

06:00.652 --> 06:02.821
I know it wasn't anything that I said.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.700
Can I sit?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.836
I was advised not to tell you this.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.714
The psychiatrist and Dr. Hall

06:20.797 --> 06:23.592
didn't think you were stable enough.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.761
The twins have different fathers.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.764
One of the babies is not mine.

06:31.433 --> 06:32.434
What?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.770
It's a medical anomaly,

06:34.853 --> 06:37.981
but there have been cases.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.568
Oh, God.

06:41.652 --> 06:43.779
When I came to see you, I was...

06:44.738 --> 06:47.074
I was convinced it was Luke.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.867
-That somehow you two...
-(whispers) Oh, God.

06:48.951 --> 06:51.161
Vivien, I'm...

06:52.496 --> 06:55.165
I'm so sorry about all this.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.918
-I really am.
-(sobbing)

06:58.001 --> 07:00.546
Do you remember anything about this guy,

07:00.629 --> 07:02.589
other than the rubber suit?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.133
His eyes, his voice?

07:05.217 --> 07:07.261
He didn't speak, Ben.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.555
Don't you think
that's all I've been thinking about

07:09.638 --> 07:11.515
since I've been in here?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.100
How did he get into our house?

07:13.183 --> 07:17.312
Where were you? How did he get that suit?

07:17.396 --> 07:19.606
I don't have any answers.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.984
But we'll find them.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.819
Together.

07:23.902 --> 07:26.446
Now, I... I've spoken to the psychiatrist,

07:26.530 --> 07:28.615
and there are some

07:28.699 --> 07:31.201
legal hiccups to work out
because of the gunshot.

07:32.661 --> 07:36.248
But you'll be able to come home
in a day or two.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.584
I promise.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.170
I'm not going back to that house.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.671
(knocking on door)

07:45.591 --> 07:48.385
-Constance Langdon?
-Yes.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.845
I'm Detective Granger.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.930
This is Detective Barrios.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.390
May we come in?

07:58.020 --> 08:00.814
BARRIOS: We know how upsetting
this must be for you, Mrs. Langdon.

08:00.898 --> 08:04.985
If you could just confirm for us
that that is Travis Wanderly.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.780
Yes, it's him.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.910
Look at that face.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.662
That beautiful, beautiful face.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.789
Who would do something like that?

08:17.873 --> 08:20.584
That's what we're trying to determine.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.628
Where did they find him?

08:22.711 --> 08:25.088
In a park. In South Central.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.966
The colored section?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.885
What on earth would he be doing there?

08:29.968 --> 08:31.929
BARRIOS: We think he was
killed somewhere else,

08:32.012 --> 08:34.389
and his body was dumped there.

08:35.224 --> 08:38.644
Wait a minute.
I heard about this on the news.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.479
They found a...

08:40.562 --> 08:43.398
A young man with his body cut in two.

08:43.482 --> 08:46.068
They called him the "Boy Dahlia."

08:46.151 --> 08:48.403
Are you saying that...

08:48.487 --> 08:51.156
That Travis is the "Boy Dahlia"?

08:51.240 --> 08:55.077
Mrs. Langdon,
did your boyfriend have any enemies?

08:55.160 --> 08:57.287
Anyone who might want to hurt him?

08:58.288 --> 08:59.748
No.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.126
Everybody loved Travis.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.254
(doorbell rings)

09:05.337 --> 09:08.131
Right. Right.
Well, it's a... It's a rubber mask.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.760
I need it tested for fingerprints and DNA.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.681
Mr. Harmon, my name is Peter McCormick.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.808
I'm a truant officer for LAUSD.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.519
Uh, yeah, uh, come in.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.145
Living room, please. Thanks.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.106
Right. Well, no, I... I don't need to...

09:24.189 --> 09:25.774
I don't need to be transferred.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.693
I just want to know which department.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.820
(flies buzzing)

09:34.908 --> 09:38.495
Oh, I'm so sorry.
That was an urgent matter.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.956
-You have blowflies.
-Oh, God.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.791
We shouldn't have left food out.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.085
I guess I better call
the exterminator then.

09:46.962 --> 09:49.047
So I assume you're here for Violet.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.133
I know she's missed a few days of school.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.136
Yes. Sixteen consecutive days.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.638
Sixteen?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.473
Yep.

09:58.557 --> 10:01.685
We've made numerous attempts
to contact your wife, Mr. Harmon.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.188
It's the only contact information we have.

10:04.271 --> 10:07.482
Any more absences and we're gonna
be seeing you in juvenile court.

I knew that.

11:18.762 --> 11:20.973
I also knew that you were smart,

11:21.056 --> 11:23.642

you want for college.

but you have to start going tomorrow.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.102
Travis is dead.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.856

12:52.940 --> 12:55.484
Wow. Wow, that's awful.

12:55.567 --> 12:57.986
Yes. So young.

-That's why you killed him, isn't it?
-No.

Because you knew I desired him
like I could never desire you.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.504
-No, no, no, no, you got it wrong.
-Now, likely,

13:15.587 --> 13:19.758

to saw you in half

13:19.842 --> 13:22.845

13:22.928 --> 13:28.225
but I certainly could, uh,
cut off some of the smaller parts.

No, no, no, no, no! I just moved the body!

13:30.644 --> 13:32.563
I didn't kill him! I swear!

13:32.646 --> 13:34.690
He must've pissed off
somebody in the house.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.233
I don't know which one!

13:37.818 --> 13:40.112

your son for all I know.

13:40.195 --> 13:42.322

13:42.656 --> 13:44.533
In the house?

13:44.616 --> 13:46.326
Travis died in the house?

13:46.410 --> 13:49.246
I didn't ask any questions.
I just moved the, you know, parts.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.915
-I've got to go to him.
-Constance, please.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.001
Please, baby, he's dead, and I'm here.

13:54.084 --> 13:56.211
And I'm alive, and I still love you.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.547

-No.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.394
for the sake of my family.

14:12.477 --> 14:13.854
That is all.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.858
So you're going back to your boy?
Your dead boy?

14:19.234 --> 14:21.737
Even dead,

14:21.820 --> 14:23.864
even a boy,

14:23.947 --> 14:26.158
he's twice the man you are.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.785
Well, he is now.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.218
(sighs)

14:53.143 --> 14:56.104
Shh, shh. Shh! Just listen to me. Listen.

14:57.523 --> 14:58.941
Don't be mad.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.610
I love you.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.695
Spend the day with me.

15:03.779 --> 15:06.782
We can play Scrabble, if you want.
I'll even let you win.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.411
I can't. I promised my dad.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.829
So, go tomorrow.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.541
It's not like they're gonna miss you
for one more day.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.803
-Come on, Violet.
-(sighs)

15:35.561 --> 15:38.772
Mrs. Langdon,
we have a few follow-up questions.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.149
Not now. This isn't a good time.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.610
We spoke to the Korean gentleman
at the corner store.

15:43.694 --> 15:46.780
He remembers your boyfriend
and all the awful fights you used to have.

15:46.864 --> 15:50.409
Those Koreans, they're so suspicious,
you know. Ever since Hiroshima.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.956
That's a concealed weapon.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.666
Why are you carrying that?

15:59.001 --> 16:01.461
Maybe because you had reason

16:01.545 --> 16:04.423
to visit the colored section of town?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.884
Why don't you come down
to the precinct, Mrs. Langdon?

16:14.266 --> 16:16.185
(buzzing)

16:16.268 --> 16:19.646
I knew it. What'd I tell you?

16:19.730 --> 16:22.441
All these old houses, they got
crawl spaces of, like, three feet.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.694
It's like a gated community
for vermin of every sort.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.030
You follow these flies,

16:28.113 --> 16:31.617
and you will find
the source of your problem.

16:31.700 --> 16:36.163
Great. More money I gotta spend on
this goddamn house that I can't afford.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.957
-So can you do it?
-You are in luck, Mr. Harmon.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.918
My last appointment blew me off,

16:41.001 --> 16:42.794
so I got an opening on my dance card.

16:42.878 --> 16:45.005
And, uh, what's your rate?

16:45.088 --> 16:48.550
I'm gonna have to get in the crawl space
before I can give you an estimate.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.552
But I can tell you this much.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.598
For the money,
I'm the best exterminator on the market.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.935
Okay, Phil, take a look.
Get me an estimate.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.520
CONSTANCE: <i>This is a disgrace.</i>

17:00.437 --> 17:02.147
You two

17:02.231 --> 17:03.649
bunglers

17:05.067 --> 17:10.614
have come to harass
the one person in this City of Angels

17:10.697 --> 17:15.160
who not only has
nothing to do with this crime,

17:15.244 --> 17:18.247
but is singularly devastated by it.

17:18.789 --> 17:23.335
You are interrupting a grieving process

17:23.418 --> 17:25.546
that started
with the death of my daughter.

17:25.629 --> 17:27.047
And now Travis.

17:27.130 --> 17:31.802
That's right. You have been touched
by a fair amount of tragedies.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.012
Lots of people dying near you.

17:34.096 --> 17:37.975
Let's see. There was your son.
Uh, Beau, was it?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.102
How old was he when he died?

17:40.185 --> 17:44.064
Beauregard was a mere boy.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.316
Taken too soon by his condition.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.944
Shitload of noise complaints
from the neighbors.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.363
-(rattling)
-(shouting)

17:51.697 --> 17:55.033
He was an exuberant boy. Full of life.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.495
Until he died of natural causes.

17:58.579 --> 18:00.956
There was Tate, of course.
A mass murderer.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.958
I will not sit here

18:04.793 --> 18:08.547
and listen to this recitation
of torments past.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.800
I have grieved enough for two lifetimes.

18:12.634 --> 18:16.889
Most people would be broken
by the death of their children,

18:16.972 --> 18:19.683
but my nature would
not permit such weakness.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.436
You're right.
Let's not talk about the dead.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.022
Let's talk about the missing.

18:25.606 --> 18:30.652
Your husband, Hugo, and your maid, Moira.
They disappeared in '83?

18:30.736 --> 18:33.447
My husband was unfaithful. That's true.

18:34.990 --> 18:39.369
You know, I never understood
what he saw in her.

18:39.995 --> 18:44.708
Perhaps it was her coarseness
that he was attracted to.

18:45.250 --> 18:50.380
I heard rumors of a love nest somewhere
down in Brazil, near the Equator.

18:50.464 --> 18:51.965
(shrieks)

18:54.843 --> 18:56.887
But I never pursued them.

18:56.970 --> 19:00.766
I am not one to stand
in the way of true love.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.352
(grunts)

19:03.435 --> 19:05.896
But what does the whereabouts

19:05.979 --> 19:09.858
of two adulterers have to do
with the murder of my Travis?

19:09.942 --> 19:11.193
GRANGER: See, that's the thing.

19:11.276 --> 19:16.490
In 1983, nobody in this department
thought they were just missing.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.826
And the D.A., he was about this close

19:19.910 --> 19:23.163
to filing murder charges on you,
Miss Langdon.

19:23.247 --> 19:25.874
(grunting) I would rather rot in hell

19:25.958 --> 19:29.127
than bury you in the same grave
as your lover.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.421
GRANGER: I read the notes on the case.

19:31.505 --> 19:33.590
They think you killed them.

19:33.674 --> 19:36.802
All they had to do was find the bodies.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.304
(dogs barking)

19:39.388 --> 19:40.973
But they never found
what they were looking for.

19:41.056 --> 19:45.227
(chuckling) <i>Because there</i>
<i>was nothing to find.</i>

19:46.520 --> 19:49.606
My husband ran away

19:49.690 --> 19:52.985
from me, from his responsibilities.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.530
It never bothered you
that he just disappeared?

20:03.036 --> 20:06.248
Once I discovered that he had cheated,

20:07.124 --> 20:10.544
Hugo meant no more to me than dog shit.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.089
GRANGER: Oh, hello, Harry.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.717
-What are you doing here?
-I've been assigned to the case.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.844
No more talking.
Nothing more is to be said

20:18.927 --> 20:20.262
until I consult with my client.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.931
But I had nothing to do
with Travis' death.

20:23.015 --> 20:25.434
-I have nothing to hide.
-Please, Miss Langdon.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.561
If you don't mind.

20:34.526 --> 20:37.070
Sorry to introduce myself
under these circumstances.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.614
Uh, Harry Goodman.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.992
What did they ask you about?

20:42.075 --> 20:45.078
Just my past. Nothing about Travis.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.538
Miss Langdon, listen to me.

20:46.622 --> 20:49.541
The "Boy Dahlia" is sexy, sensational.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.002
It's gonna bring a lot of attention
to this department,

20:52.085 --> 20:53.545
so they're moving fast.

20:53.629 --> 20:55.797
That's good.
I want them to find the murderer.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.050
No. They want to pin it on somebody.

20:58.425 --> 21:00.552
And right now, that person is you.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.596
And if you say one more word,

21:02.679 --> 21:04.723
you could find yourself
in a very tight spot.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.102
(whistling
<i>The Battle Hymn of the Republic)</i>

21:14.399 --> 21:16.151
(Austrian accent) The Verminator is here.

21:17.319 --> 21:21.448
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

21:21.532 --> 21:25.869
If you can't pay the rent, don't...
(murmurs)

21:25.953 --> 21:27.621
(flies buzzing)

21:28.789 --> 21:29.998
I knew it.

21:30.082 --> 21:33.252
When you're right, you're right.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.170
Get ready to meet your maker.

21:41.218 --> 21:43.095
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

21:45.764 --> 21:48.100
Phil! You're a murderer.

21:48.183 --> 21:50.519
You need to stay and repent

21:50.602 --> 21:53.188
for the countless innocent lives
you've stolen!

21:55.190 --> 21:56.191
(grunts)

21:56.275 --> 21:59.069
(gagging, choking)

22:02.948 --> 22:05.450
BEN: I see.
Well, yes, I've heard some great things

22:05.534 --> 22:08.495
about your Chinese language program.

22:08.579 --> 22:11.248
You're right. China's the future.

22:11.331 --> 22:14.543
Hey, just out of curiosity,
what kind of financial aid packages

22:14.626 --> 22:17.796
do you offer for academic high achievers?

22:17.880 --> 22:21.258
Yes, she's been an "A" student
until this semester.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.218
Her I.Q. is north of 150.

22:30.851 --> 22:34.271
Well, my daughter has
a very bright future, that I know.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.857
Truthfully, our real concern

22:36.940 --> 22:38.984
has been the kid
she's been hanging around lately.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.487
Mmm. Just not cut from the same cloth.

22:48.118 --> 22:50.412
Where have you been?
I just took your rook.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.914
Checkmate in 13 moves.

22:54.917 --> 22:56.418
What's wrong?

22:56.502 --> 22:58.754
He wants to separate us.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.797
He's gonna send you away.

23:00.881 --> 23:02.090
What are you talking about?

23:02.633 --> 23:04.760
I just heard him talking on the phone
with a boarding school,

23:05.344 --> 23:07.346
asking about financial packages.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.639
(gasps softly)

23:12.476 --> 23:15.521
Makes sense. He sent Mom away.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.814
I don't know why I thought I was safe.

23:17.898 --> 23:19.858
I just assumed I was his little girl.

23:20.609 --> 23:21.860
What a fantasy.

23:23.529 --> 23:25.697
I'm so stupid and naive sometimes.

23:26.782 --> 23:28.325
Of course he's gonna send me away too.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.162
(sighs)

23:36.041 --> 23:37.793
There's nothing stupid about you.

23:39.878 --> 23:41.463
And I won't let him send you away.

23:59.106 --> 24:00.649
(flies buzzing)

24:20.961 --> 24:23.380
Hey. What are you doing
with my stuff, man?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.299
Uh...

24:25.382 --> 24:27.176
What?

24:27.259 --> 24:30.721
Uh, nothing. I, uh...

24:30.804 --> 24:32.472
-I had to move it.
-Why?

24:32.556 --> 24:36.268
Well, it's evidence.
You know, you can't leave it lying around.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.687
Oh, okay.

24:39.897 --> 24:42.608
Hey, man, um, have I made the news?

24:43.192 --> 24:45.569
The news. Oh, God, yeah.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.487
You've been all over the news.

24:47.571 --> 24:50.532
Yeah? (chuckles)

24:50.616 --> 24:51.992
Well, what about... What about Constance?

24:52.075 --> 24:53.869
Nah. She hasn't been in the news.

24:53.952 --> 24:57.831
No, no, no.
I... I mean, how'd she take it?

24:57.915 --> 24:59.041
Oh.

25:00.459 --> 25:01.710
Pretty hard.

25:03.378 --> 25:04.713
Cool.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.466
Why doesn't she come over to see me?

25:09.343 --> 25:11.512
Too soon, I suppose.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.681
GIRL: Travis, come play with us.

25:14.765 --> 25:16.725
Yeah, I'll be right there, girls.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.734
-Those girls...
-Yeah.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.361
Margaret and Angela.

25:27.444 --> 25:29.029
Found 'em hiding down here.

25:29.947 --> 25:32.741
Sweet kids. A little needy, but...

25:34.952 --> 25:36.828
Oh, say, man, do you think, um,

25:36.912 --> 25:39.081
maybe you could snag me some clippings?

25:39.164 --> 25:41.792
You know, news articles about me?

25:41.875 --> 25:44.545
Just thinking about
starting a little scrapbook.

25:44.628 --> 25:45.671
Mmm.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.339
Thanks. (chuckles)

25:52.344 --> 25:54.721
(British accent) Let's see if
I can get my seat back here.

25:54.805 --> 25:57.474
Take it from these little dollies.

25:57.558 --> 25:59.101
May I have some tea, please?

25:59.184 --> 26:01.562
-GIRL: Mm-hmm.
-TRAVIS: Thank you.

26:01.645 --> 26:03.105
Best tea ever.

26:04.565 --> 26:05.774
He's so good with them.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.654
Lorraine.

26:11.572 --> 26:14.449
I don't think I've ever seen Margaret
take to anyone so quickly.

26:14.533 --> 26:16.618
They've been so afraid up till now.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.246
Lonely.

26:19.329 --> 26:20.914
We all have.

26:20.998 --> 26:23.834
Why am I seeing you now after...

26:23.917 --> 26:25.586
After all this time?

26:26.336 --> 26:28.088
You're ready now.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.800
You're on the cusp.

26:32.467 --> 26:34.678
Lorraine, I'm...

26:37.472 --> 26:39.099
I'm so sorry.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.185
For everything.

26:45.814 --> 26:48.108
-Prove it.
-Yeah.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.695
I'm gonna make her pay.

26:52.905 --> 26:58.118
Lorraine, I'll see to it
that Constance rots in prison

26:58.202 --> 27:00.329
for what she did to our family.

27:00.412 --> 27:04.917
Constance didn't do
anything to our family, Larry.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.252
She didn't break any vows, hmm?

27:07.336 --> 27:08.670
That was you.

27:24.478 --> 27:26.271
Ah! Ah!

27:30.150 --> 27:31.527
(grunts)

27:31.610 --> 27:33.779
You sick son of a bitch!

27:33.862 --> 27:35.113
Show your face!

27:36.114 --> 27:37.908
Who are you?

27:41.286 --> 27:42.663
(grunting)

27:49.711 --> 27:51.463
(clattering)

27:51.547 --> 27:53.215
(glass shatters)

27:54.925 --> 27:58.720
You raped my wife! You raped my wife!
You raped my wife!

28:00.347 --> 28:01.557
Show me your face!

28:02.641 --> 28:05.269
Who are you? Who are you?

28:05.352 --> 28:07.020
(grunts)

28:09.439 --> 28:11.066
Ah! Ah!

28:14.027 --> 28:15.362
(grunts)

28:18.407 --> 28:19.992
(muffled shouting)

28:24.788 --> 28:26.582
(muffled shouting)

28:30.085 --> 28:31.378
Tate.

28:33.172 --> 28:35.299
Violet!

28:35.382 --> 28:37.426
Wha...

28:37.509 --> 28:40.095
Wha... (groans)

28:43.348 --> 28:46.351
The only reason
I'm not killing you is for her.

28:46.894 --> 28:50.522
You just take a little nap,
and it'll all be over.

28:58.071 --> 28:59.448
Vanilla latte.

29:00.824 --> 29:03.327
Uh, nonfat, decaf, sugar-free shot.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.496
Nothing in it that's bad for you.

29:06.580 --> 29:07.789
What's wrong?

29:08.790 --> 29:10.250
They didn't say.

29:10.959 --> 29:14.004
They just want us down at
the police station as soon as possible.

29:14.087 --> 29:18.008
Now I have already answered
all their questions.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.928
They cannot pin this murder on me.

29:21.512 --> 29:22.804
Something new must have surfaced.

29:22.888 --> 29:25.140
An eyewitness, a piece of evidence.

29:26.767 --> 29:28.310
I think you're gonna be charged.

29:32.731 --> 29:34.024
What did you do to him?

29:34.107 --> 29:37.194
I just convinced him
to leave us alone for an hour or so.

29:37.277 --> 29:38.779
Tate, what did you do to him?

29:38.862 --> 29:40.322
I didn't do anything bad!

29:40.405 --> 29:42.407
Just scared him a little. He'll be fine.

29:42.491 --> 29:43.784
But we're running out of time.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.118
You're being weird. Time for what?

29:45.202 --> 29:46.787
I figured out how to keep them
from sending you away.

29:46.870 --> 29:47.913
You mean, run away?

29:47.996 --> 29:49.831
Kind of. Yeah.

29:50.499 --> 29:54.002
I love you, Violet,
and I want you to be happy and free.

29:55.087 --> 29:57.548
If we take these, we can stay here.

29:57.631 --> 29:59.341
We can play with Beauregard.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.677
We can play games, watch videos.

30:01.760 --> 30:03.887
We can be together forever.

30:04.555 --> 30:06.181
You want us to commit suicide?

30:07.933 --> 30:13.105
Yeah. And I don't think there's enough
in here to really, you know...

30:13.188 --> 30:15.691
So I think if we use these...

30:15.774 --> 30:17.067
Where did you get those pills?

30:17.150 --> 30:18.360
Your dad has a lot of samples.

30:18.443 --> 30:20.237
-Did you hurt my dad?
-No, I told you!

30:20.320 --> 30:23.240
I just knocked him out
so I could buy us some time.

30:23.323 --> 30:25.784
Listen to me, Violet.
We can't get all chickenshit about this.

30:25.868 --> 30:27.703
We're running out of options!

30:33.500 --> 30:36.003
Yeah. Okay, I get it.

30:36.086 --> 30:37.588
It's the only way we can be together.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.175
Like Romeo and Juliet.

30:44.303 --> 30:46.180
I know how to do it so that it won't hurt.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.640
-Can we do it in the bathtub?
-Why?

30:48.724 --> 30:51.768
'Cause it's warm and nice,
and I can light some candles.

30:54.146 --> 30:56.565
Okay. But we have to go now.

30:56.648 --> 30:58.400
I'll... I'll go run the bath.

30:58.483 --> 30:59.693
Okay.

31:10.204 --> 31:13.373
VIOLET: Help! Dad, help me!
He's trying to kill me! Help!

31:13.457 --> 31:15.000
Violet, no!

31:15.083 --> 31:18.587
Help! Dad!

31:20.839 --> 31:22.090
Dad?

31:27.346 --> 31:28.847
Help me! (dog barking)

31:28.931 --> 31:32.184
Help! Help me!

31:38.440 --> 31:40.901
What's happening? What did you do to me?

31:40.984 --> 31:43.779
You have to stop.
Let's just do what we said we would.

31:43.862 --> 31:46.990
Dad, where are you? Help me!

31:47.074 --> 31:48.825
Violet. Stop running!

31:50.827 --> 31:52.287
(panting)

32:06.343 --> 32:07.803
(sobbing)

32:17.020 --> 32:19.439
Please, Tate, please. I don't want to die.

32:21.817 --> 32:23.402
It's too late for that.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.781
(panting)

32:32.619 --> 32:35.038
Violet, listen to me.

32:36.081 --> 32:38.917
Why am I running around
like a crazy person?

32:39.001 --> 32:40.794
Did you drug me?

32:40.878 --> 32:42.754
I'm not gonna hurt you.

32:43.297 --> 32:45.174
I have to show you something.

32:45.257 --> 32:47.968
And then you're free
to go wherever you want.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.720
I promise I won't stop you.

32:54.391 --> 32:55.934
You have to trust me.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.709
(hinges squeak)

33:21.710 --> 33:23.003
I feel weird.

33:23.545 --> 33:24.880
Like I'm losing it.

33:35.891 --> 33:37.142
Come on.

33:55.577 --> 33:57.371
(screams)

34:01.542 --> 34:03.627
It's so disgusting down here.

34:06.129 --> 34:07.673
Okay, come on.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.510
Close your eyes.

34:12.845 --> 34:14.429
And remember

34:14.513 --> 34:16.640
everything's gonna be okay.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.016
I love you.

34:30.821 --> 34:32.072
Open your eyes.

34:32.990 --> 34:35.826
(flies buzzing)

34:38.036 --> 34:39.705
(sobbing)

34:40.914 --> 34:44.168
(wailing)

34:44.626 --> 34:47.880
What? No!

34:50.966 --> 34:52.634
Don't you die on me!

34:54.344 --> 34:56.096
Violet!

34:57.347 --> 34:59.433
I died when I took all those pills.

35:01.185 --> 35:02.853
I tried to save you.

35:04.188 --> 35:07.774
I did. I tried to make you throw them up.

35:09.443 --> 35:12.821
You threw up some. Not enough.

35:12.905 --> 35:15.949
-(wailing)
-You took so many, Violet.

35:16.033 --> 35:18.410
(crying)

35:19.036 --> 35:20.954
You died crying.

35:21.038 --> 35:22.831
(sniffling)

35:22.915 --> 35:26.210
I held you. You were safe.

35:28.170 --> 35:32.299
You died loved.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.428
I hardly feel anything.

35:44.019 --> 35:46.271
I didn't want you
to find out this way, Violet.

35:46.355 --> 35:47.898
You or your parents.

35:48.732 --> 35:51.735
I had this idea that if you chose to die,

35:52.486 --> 35:53.820
with me,

35:55.155 --> 35:56.990
you wouldn't be so sad.

35:58.700 --> 36:00.744
I never wanted you to see this.

36:00.827 --> 36:03.664
I'm so sorry, Violet. (whimpering)

36:12.548 --> 36:15.551
Detective, I want it noted that my client
is here on her own volition,

36:15.634 --> 36:16.969
and that your department hasn't shown

36:17.052 --> 36:19.263
a shred of evidence
that could link Miss Langdon

36:19.346 --> 36:21.807
to the tragic murder of Travis Wanderly.

36:21.890 --> 36:23.433
We have the murder weapon, Counselor.

36:23.517 --> 36:25.227
Well, it's not mine.

36:25.310 --> 36:27.020
Whatever it is, it's not mine.

36:27.104 --> 36:29.398
I had nothing to do with it.

36:29.481 --> 36:31.400
You are not going to hold me responsible

36:31.483 --> 36:33.068
for a crime I did not commit.

36:40.117 --> 36:41.368
(door shuts)

36:45.622 --> 36:47.332
GRANGER: Do you know this man?

36:47.416 --> 36:49.251
He says he knows you.

36:49.334 --> 36:50.586
He did?

36:51.712 --> 36:53.422
What else did he say?

36:53.505 --> 36:56.592
He says he killed Travis alone.

36:56.675 --> 36:59.511
Says nobody else
had anything to do with it.

36:59.595 --> 37:00.846
And you believed him.

37:00.929 --> 37:02.681
He came in with the murder weapon.

37:02.764 --> 37:04.933
Described in detail
what happened to the body.

37:05.017 --> 37:07.561
Details we'd never released to the public.

37:07.853 --> 37:09.730
Since he said he knew you,

37:09.813 --> 37:13.358
I was hoping you would
help us with the motive.

37:13.442 --> 37:16.862
Can you tell us anything
that might make sense?

37:17.863 --> 37:21.783
I'm sorry, Detective. I have no answers.

37:23.327 --> 37:27.331
I can only imagine that
he confessed for one reason.

37:31.043 --> 37:33.462
To pacify a guilty conscience.

37:41.428 --> 37:45.182
So, all this time,

But you were protecting me.

37:50.604 --> 37:51.980
That's all I ever wanted to do,

37:52.689 --> 37:54.566
since I first saw you.

37:57.110 --> 37:58.987
So why'd you keep it a secret?

38:01.031 --> 38:02.783
Hi. I'm Tate.

38:02.866 --> 38:04.284
I'm dead.

38:04.368 --> 38:06.203

I don't think so.

No, I mean, like, how's it going to be?

39:15.272 --> 39:16.565
(chair sliding)

39:34.041 --> 39:36.835
Hello, Constance.
Thanks for coming to see me.

39:36.919 --> 39:37.961
What do you want?

39:38.045 --> 39:40.964
I just wanted to see you. One last time.

39:42.090 --> 39:47.471
I wanted to take the image of you
with me into my captivity.

39:48.764 --> 39:50.516
Well, take a good look.

39:50.974 --> 39:52.976
It's the last time
you're ever gonna see me.

39:53.060 --> 39:58.148
I know. They're sending me out of state
to serve my sentence. Illinois.

39:58.232 --> 40:00.192
Though I understand
that the penitentiary there

40:00.275 --> 40:02.819
has a very fine theater program.

40:02.903 --> 40:06.406
Well, you'll finally have that captive
audience you've always dreamed of.

40:06.490 --> 40:08.909
(chuckling)

40:08.992 --> 40:11.495
Aren't you going to ask me why, Constance?

40:11.578 --> 40:12.913
Why what?

40:12.996 --> 40:14.623
Why did I confess to a crime

40:14.706 --> 40:17.709
we both know I didn't commit?

40:17.793 --> 40:22.798
I have long stopped asking
why the mad do mad things.

40:22.881 --> 40:26.635
But if you thought you were protecting me,

40:26.718 --> 40:29.054
then you're a bigger fool
than I ever took you for.

40:29.137 --> 40:33.600
No. I have no illusion
that you need protecting.

40:34.351 --> 40:36.728
From me, or any man.

40:37.521 --> 40:39.690
No. This is about me.

40:39.773 --> 40:44.152
I need to pay for my crimes, Constance.

40:45.529 --> 40:46.572
All of them.

40:46.655 --> 40:49.283
Well, it looks like
you're gonna get your wish.

40:49.366 --> 40:52.619
You're gonna die in here.
You know that, don't you?

40:52.703 --> 40:55.706
I don't mind. I can take it.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.875
I can endure it all

40:57.958 --> 40:59.751
if you'll just say those words.

41:06.466 --> 41:08.343
I know you loved me once, Constance.

41:09.511 --> 41:10.679
Just say it,

41:11.430 --> 41:13.265
and I can face whatever may come.
