Frank, can you hear me?

10:54.025 --> 10:57.193
We're with the FBI.
Do you know what happened to you?

10:57.195 --> 10:58.895
Frank, you were
in a plane crash.

10:58.897 --> 11:01.080
What's the last
thing you remember?

11:01.082 --> 11:02.949
I don't know.

11:02.951 --> 11:05.652
Did you see a trail
of light approaching?

11:05.654 --> 11:07.654
There was a jolt.

11:07.656 --> 11:11.157
Severe turbulence.

11:11.159 --> 11:13.626
It was so bad.

11:15.547 --> 11:19.132
I said stop.

11:19.134 --> 11:20.750
I said stop.

11:20.752 --> 11:23.169
Excuse me, we need
to get him to surgery.

11:23.171 --> 11:24.637
Severe turbulence?

11:24.639 --> 11:26.422
I thought the weather
was clear.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.308
He said there was
a jolt, though.

11:28.310 --> 11:30.677
If not turbulence,
it sounds like something hit the plane.

11:30.679 --> 11:33.012
Ok, well, other options
beside a missile

11:33.014 --> 11:35.348
would be a bird strike
or a meteor.

11:35.350 --> 11:37.734
Bird strikes normally
happen in lower altitudes,

11:37.736 --> 11:38.851
around takeoff and landing.

11:38.853 --> 11:41.020
Between a meteor
and a missile,

11:41.022 --> 11:43.606
I'd put my money
on a missile.

11:43.608 --> 11:45.108
No, I can't get through
to anyone!

11:45.110 --> 11:48.111
I've called the airline
and it just keeps going to a recording.

11:48.113 --> 11:50.997
I have to go.
I'll call you when I get there, ok?

11:50.999 --> 11:53.116
Come on!
[Honking]

11:53.118 --> 11:55.451
This rural area
just north of Durango, Colorado...

11:55.453 --> 11:57.704
He knows who did it,
but he won't tell us.

11:57.706 --> 11:59.122
The guy's a whackadoodle.

11:59.124 --> 12:01.457
Well, unfortunately
we can't dismiss him yet.

12:01.459 --> 12:03.793
The fact is, no one else has come
forward with a similar statement.

12:03.795 --> 12:05.461
That's because the population
is so sparse out here.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.846
We should be grateful
for that.

12:06.848 --> 12:08.047
You're right.

12:08.049 --> 12:10.016
Can you get him to talk?

12:10.018 --> 12:12.385
I can try.
But I should probably do it alone.

12:12.387 --> 12:15.054
I think he has a problem
with you.

12:15.056 --> 12:16.739
My race or my gender?

12:16.741 --> 12:18.274
Probably both.

12:18.276 --> 12:19.692
Wonderful.

12:19.694 --> 12:22.395
As long as you can
get some answers, be my guest.

12:24.399 --> 12:26.532
Mr. Petosky, I'm starting
to lose my patience.

12:26.534 --> 12:27.984
One more question.

12:27.986 --> 12:29.535
Edgewood Arsenal.

12:29.537 --> 12:31.721
What happened there?

12:31.723 --> 12:34.991
From 1955 to 1975
the U.S. military

12:34.993 --> 12:37.660
conducted research
into psycho-chemical agents

12:37.662 --> 12:40.079
by testing them
on human subjects.

12:40.081 --> 12:42.582
You pass.

12:42.584 --> 12:46.052
The other one,
she can't be trusted.

12:46.054 --> 12:47.670
Because she's military.

12:47.672 --> 12:49.839
The military
brought down that plane.

12:49.841 --> 12:53.343
Just like United 93
and TWA 800.

12:53.345 --> 12:55.428
Probably that missing
Malaysia air jet.

12:55.430 --> 12:56.929
Thank you for your time, sir.

12:56.931 --> 12:58.464
Wait.

12:58.466 --> 13:00.183
I'm not making this up.

13:00.185 --> 13:04.604
I've seen covert military
types roaming the woods.

13:04.606 --> 13:08.441
Watch your back,
Agent Hotchner.

13:08.443 --> 13:12.662
You're not all playing
on the same team.

13:14.115 --> 13:16.916
If a MANPAD,
a shoulder launched

13:16.918 --> 13:18.367
surface-to-air missile
were used,

13:18.369 --> 13:21.203
we're looking at
a target acquisition range of 6 miles.

13:21.205 --> 13:23.038
Factor that into the plane's
forward momentum as it's coming down

13:23.040 --> 13:24.874
and we're left with
this area right here.

13:24.876 --> 13:27.293
MANPADs are cheap
and plentiful on the black market.

13:27.295 --> 13:29.094
You can get one
for a few hundred bucks.

13:29.096 --> 13:32.348
I thought only planes
closer to the ground were vulnerable.

13:32.350 --> 13:35.634
True. Mo heat-seeking missiles
have a maximum range of 20,000 feet.

13:35.636 --> 13:38.971
Large systems like the Buk
which took down Malaysia Air 17

13:38.973 --> 13:41.090
are hard to get
and require expertise.

13:41.092 --> 13:44.109
You know, it's possible the plane
was brought down to 20,000 feet

13:44.111 --> 13:45.561
to get it into
manpad target range.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.613
That would mean
a hijacker was on board.

13:47.615 --> 13:50.115
That could account for
the missing 13 minutes of communication.

13:50.117 --> 13:53.485
If there were a hijacker, he had
at least one partner on the ground.

13:53.487 --> 13:55.454
Guess who drew
the short straw.

13:55.456 --> 13:57.823
Depends on if you believe suicide
is the gateway to paradise or not.

13:57.825 --> 14:00.042
Has anyone been red-flagged
on the passenger manifest?

14:00.044 --> 14:01.460
Not yet.

14:01.462 --> 14:04.914
If a terrorist cell is responsible,
this is just the beginning.

14:04.916 --> 14:07.917
[Overlapping shouting]

14:07.919 --> 14:10.502
I'm sorry. I have
no information for you.

14:10.504 --> 14:13.088
Please, please, everyone
please listen to me.

14:13.090 --> 14:16.475
If you go to the family area, someone
will be in shortly to help you.

14:16.477 --> 14:18.811
My name's Shelley Hicks.
My husband was on that plane.

14:18.813 --> 14:20.763
Please! We need you all
to go to the family room.

14:20.765 --> 14:23.515
Someone will be there to help you.
Please, listen.

14:23.517 --> 14:26.936
I promise.
Trust what I'm saying.

14:26.938 --> 14:29.572
Agent Reid said passengers
vomited before the crash,

14:29.574 --> 14:32.441
which would confirm the severe turbulence
the copilot described.

14:32.443 --> 14:34.493
Well, that specific type of movement--
porpoising--

14:34.495 --> 14:35.945
tends to cause vomiting.

14:35.947 --> 14:38.163
Porpoising--isn't it going
up and down on a wave

14:38.165 --> 14:39.698
or like a roller coaster?

14:39.700 --> 14:41.617
Yes, as opposed to
side-to-side movement.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.152
And what would cause
porpoising?

14:43.154 --> 14:44.787
Being caught in the
jetstream of another plane,

14:44.789 --> 14:46.622
but there was
no other flight nearby.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.124
Is there something else,
something mechanical, perhaps?

14:49.126 --> 14:51.043
A deployment
of the slats mid-air.

14:51.045 --> 14:52.094
You mean the flaps.

14:52.096 --> 14:53.629
The flaps are on
the back of the wing.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.681
The slats are similar,
but they're on the leading edge.

14:55.683 --> 14:56.966
They're used during takeoff.

14:56.968 --> 14:58.634
It's very rare that they
would deploy mid-flight.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.135
There's lots of
safeguards against it.

15:00.137 --> 15:02.638
Please! His name is
Frank Canvers.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.306
Somebody has to know
something.

15:04.308 --> 15:06.308
Excuse me. Are you related
to Frank Canvers?

15:06.310 --> 15:09.478
I'm his wife.
He was copilot on the flight.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.896
Ma'am, your husband
is alive.

15:10.898 --> 15:12.197
He's in surgery right now.

15:12.199 --> 15:14.066
Oh, thank God.

15:14.068 --> 15:16.068
It's ok. It's ok.

15:16.070 --> 15:18.654
Come with me, ok? I'll have someone
take you to the hospital.

15:18.656 --> 15:20.039
Ok. Thank you.

15:20.041 --> 15:21.907
Thank you.

15:23.828 --> 15:27.246
Commander Reardon
says the president wants more proof

15:27.248 --> 15:29.915
of a terrorist cell
before he approves broader actions.

15:29.917 --> 15:31.634
[Cell phone rings]
Go ahead, Garcia.

15:31.636 --> 15:34.003
Ok, going off of braniac's
target acquisition range,

15:34.005 --> 15:36.338
I tried to identify all
the residents in the area,

15:36.340 --> 15:38.674
which is no easy feat,
btw, considering

15:38.676 --> 15:42.011
most of them are doomsday preppers
and don't want to be found at all.

15:42.013 --> 15:43.896
Anyway, I did background
checks on everyone.

15:43.898 --> 15:45.648
I have two sort of
interesting possibilities.

15:45.650 --> 15:48.851
One is Jesse Bronwen.
He made several donations

15:48.853 --> 15:50.786
last year to a Denver mosque.

15:50.788 --> 15:52.171
The other is David Marshak.

15:52.173 --> 15:54.490
He is a former
army missile operator

15:54.492 --> 15:57.109
who was dishonorably discharged
two years ago for misconduct.

15:57.111 --> 15:58.861
And of course,
I just sent you the coordinates.

15:58.863 --> 15:59.912
Hotch: All right, thanks.

15:59.914 --> 16:01.363
Why don't you and Morgan
talk to Marshak.

16:01.365 --> 16:02.748
JJ and I will talk
to Bronwen.

16:02.750 --> 16:03.750
Will do.

16:03.751 --> 16:05.200
Roughly two thirds
into the flight...

16:05.202 --> 16:07.920
I say we let Cole
take care of himself.

16:07.922 --> 16:10.089
He's a big boy.
He can handle things.

16:10.091 --> 16:12.207
Shut up
and get in the truck.

16:19.967 --> 16:20.933
Forgot the lights.

16:20.935 --> 16:22.968
There's no need
to draw attention.

16:22.970 --> 16:23.970
Get the gate.

16:23.971 --> 16:25.187
[Whistles]

16:31.112 --> 16:32.728
[Sirens]

16:32.730 --> 16:33.730
don't move!

16:33.731 --> 16:34.897
Hands up!

16:34.899 --> 16:35.899
Let me see
your hands.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.133
Right there.
Right there.

16:38.135 --> 16:40.319
Weapons.

16:40.321 --> 16:41.453
FBI!

16:41.455 --> 16:44.490
Show us your hands
and get out of the vehicle!

16:46.794 --> 16:48.360
Ok. Hey.

16:59.897 --> 17:02.497
Listen, I can assure you
that you're in serious trouble already.

17:03.074 --> 17:04.523
So anything you want
to offer us up right now

17:04.526 --> 17:06.192
might just buy you
some leniency.

17:06.194 --> 17:07.861
I have nothing to say.

17:07.863 --> 17:10.280
When you were in the army,
you posted on your website

17:10.281 --> 17:12.031
"Apocalypse forever."

17:12.032 --> 17:14.666
You claimed that you
and your brother Cole

17:14.669 --> 17:18.872
had the skills to shoot down a plane
and start World War III.

17:18.874 --> 17:21.307
Is that what you were
trying to do?

17:24.002 --> 17:26.378
Where the hell is Cole?

17:28.566 --> 17:31.284
Lawyer.

17:33.738 --> 17:37.039
We just found a crate of Soviet-era
missiles hidden in Marshak's cellar.

17:37.041 --> 17:39.709
They're pretty old. Not the kind that
would bring down a plane.

17:39.711 --> 17:42.044
I don't think Marshak and his guys have
the smarts to pull this off.

17:42.046 --> 17:44.997
And if they did do it,
they'd want to brag about it.

17:44.999 --> 17:46.382
What about
the missing brother?

17:46.384 --> 17:47.917
Do you think Cole
could have done this alone?

17:47.919 --> 17:50.253
Or with some other group
of disgruntled friends.

17:50.255 --> 17:52.588
Till we find him
he's the wild card.

17:52.590 --> 17:56.042
We finished sergeant Bronwen's house.
No sign of any missiles.

17:56.044 --> 17:58.477
He's a recent convert
to Islam, but he's not an extremist.

17:58.479 --> 18:00.596
What's Spence doing?

18:01.850 --> 18:04.817
Guys, these are the construction
blueprints for the airplane.

18:04.819 --> 18:06.652
I compared it to the way
the plane broke apart,

18:06.654 --> 18:09.438
and I think I may have
found something interesting.

18:10.525 --> 18:12.158
The hull of an airplane

18:12.160 --> 18:15.995
is really just a bunch
or round barrels riveted together.

18:15.997 --> 18:18.114
The wing, however,
is a masterpiece.

18:18.116 --> 18:20.283
It's the most physically
complicated component of an airplane.

18:20.285 --> 18:23.669
Nearly 200 feet long,
it bears the weight of the entire aircraft

18:23.671 --> 18:27.123
and is shaped precisely
to fit within a hundredth of an inch.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.091
The curvature of the wing
is what gives it its lift.

18:29.093 --> 18:32.128
Air rushes faster over the top,
creating a vacuum,

18:32.130 --> 18:35.965
which sucks the wing upward
and in turn the entire fuselage.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.684
This is important because an airplane
wants to be nose-up.

18:38.686 --> 18:41.053
It creates positive Gs,
that sensation you get

18:41.055 --> 18:42.889
when you're forced
to the back of your seat.

18:42.891 --> 18:44.724
Negative Gs,
on the other hand,

18:44.726 --> 18:46.859
are an entirely
different matter.

18:48.196 --> 18:50.146
[Screaming]

18:50.148 --> 18:52.315
When the nose of a plane
begins pitching downward,

18:52.317 --> 18:54.483
you get negative Gs,
which puts enormous pressure

18:54.485 --> 18:56.786
on the structural integrity
of the aircraft.

19:03.044 --> 19:06.329
With enough negative Gs, the wings
will start  to rip off the plane,

19:06.331 --> 19:09.382
which then compromises
the fuselage.

19:13.004 --> 19:14.670
The plane broke
into major pieces

19:14.672 --> 19:17.340
along structural joints
and attachment points.

19:17.342 --> 19:19.175
There's no evidence
of gaping holes

19:19.177 --> 19:22.178
or pieces of the fuselage
torn in areas without seams

19:22.180 --> 19:26.349
to suggest impact with an
external object like a missile.

19:30.021 --> 19:32.855
So the fact is, the way
the plane broke apart,

19:32.857 --> 19:35.391
I think the crash was caused
by something internal.

19:35.393 --> 19:38.778
So are we talking about
some sort of explosive decompression,

19:38.780 --> 19:40.279
like on TWA flight 800?

19:40.281 --> 19:41.447
A massive explosion
would have resulted

19:41.449 --> 19:44.100
in pieces of fuselage
the size of a carry-on.

19:44.102 --> 19:46.702
That rules out a hijacker
with a bomb as well.

19:46.704 --> 19:48.371
Wait a minute. A hijacker
would certainly explain

19:48.373 --> 19:49.872
the 13 minutes of lost
communication.

19:49.874 --> 19:52.208
Maybe he drove the plane
into the ground.

19:52.210 --> 19:53.876
Or the passengers did.

19:53.878 --> 19:56.045
This could be the start
of another 9/11.

19:56.047 --> 19:58.381
If that were the case,
I'd suspect a faster cascade of events.

19:58.383 --> 19:59.765
Still, we can't
rule it out.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.767
The reality is,
there are at least 50 reasons

20:01.769 --> 20:03.135
for lost communication.

20:03.137 --> 20:04.103
Such as?

20:04.105 --> 20:05.554
As stuck mike,
an air traffic controller

20:05.556 --> 20:07.223
sending the wrong frequency
to an aircraft.

20:07.225 --> 20:10.309
The average amount of time
for lost communication is 7 1/2 minutes.

20:10.311 --> 20:12.311
We have to remember
the transponder was still working.

20:12.313 --> 20:14.480
No secret code
to indicate a hijacking

20:14.482 --> 20:16.232
or any other
emergency was sent.

20:16.234 --> 20:17.418
Let's think about this.

20:17.442 --> 20:19.426
The ACARS data recording
system was turned off.

20:19.604 --> 20:21.988
And that would have to come from
someone in control of the flight systems.

20:21.990 --> 20:23.456
So something happened
in the cockpit.

20:23.458 --> 20:25.408
That makes it the pilot
and/or the copilot

20:25.410 --> 20:27.243
the most likely
candidates.

20:27.245 --> 20:29.128
Their background checks
came back clear.

20:29.130 --> 20:30.413
What about suicide?

20:30.415 --> 20:32.732
You mentioned a slats
deployment mid-air.

20:32.734 --> 20:35.001
You said it was very rare.
But if it did happen,

20:35.003 --> 20:36.469
how would it happen?

20:36.471 --> 20:38.471
Pilot error

20:38.473 --> 20:40.673
or intention.

20:43.144 --> 20:46.812
Are you remembering more
about what happened before the crash?

20:46.814 --> 20:51.350
I, uh...it's still foggy.

20:53.688 --> 20:56.288
Yes, he did take
a medical leave of absence

20:56.290 --> 20:58.774
two years ago,
but he was cleared to fly again.

20:58.776 --> 21:00.559
What was the reason?

21:00.561 --> 21:02.945
He...

21:02.947 --> 21:05.448
Had some problems
with depression,

21:05.450 --> 21:07.783
but he was treated
with Fluoxetine.

21:07.785 --> 21:10.953
You don't actually think
he caused this crash, do you?

21:10.955 --> 21:12.788
Ma'am, we have to consider
all possibilities.

21:12.790 --> 21:15.041
He passed all his physical
and mental health evaluations.

21:15.043 --> 21:18.377
Is he still taking
Fluoxetine?

21:19.180 --> 21:22.131
He...He stopped
4 months ago.

21:22.133 --> 21:24.517
But he's been fine.

21:27.138 --> 21:30.222
How have you been feeling
the last few weeks?

21:30.224 --> 21:32.024
Fine.

21:33.644 --> 21:35.311
Normal.

21:35.313 --> 21:38.197
Were you depressed
at all?

21:38.199 --> 21:40.483
No.

21:40.485 --> 21:42.818
I've been good.

21:42.820 --> 21:45.438
He would never
do something like this.

21:45.440 --> 21:48.541
I do know that Gerry--
captain Valmeyer--

21:48.543 --> 21:50.292
rented out a room
in his house last year

21:50.294 --> 21:52.111
to a grad student
from Indonesia.

21:52.113 --> 21:54.330
The guy was weird.

21:54.332 --> 21:58.918
Always asking Frank
and Gerry about airplanes.

21:58.920 --> 22:01.504
Earlier you said
there was turbulence.

22:01.506 --> 22:04.423
Then you said "stop."
Who were you talking to?

22:04.425 --> 22:06.976
Uh, Gerry.

22:06.978 --> 22:09.178
The pilot.

22:09.180 --> 22:12.098
Were you telling him
to stop doing something?

22:12.100 --> 22:13.749
Yes, I...

22:14.986 --> 22:17.353
We were arguing...

22:17.355 --> 22:19.271
about something.

22:19.273 --> 22:22.324
Did he deploy the slats?

22:22.326 --> 22:24.243
I'm not sure.

22:24.245 --> 22:27.863
Do you remember turning off
the ACARS system?

22:29.784 --> 22:33.919
Frank, did you turn off
the ACARS system?

22:36.290 --> 22:37.290
Yes.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.841
Why?

22:40.545 --> 22:44.296
I don't know.

22:44.298 --> 22:47.850
I can't--I can't remember.

22:49.103 --> 22:51.387
Ok, we'll look into it.
Thanks, JJ.

22:51.389 --> 22:53.606
If the pilot or copilot
was working with the terrorists,

22:53.608 --> 22:55.107
that would explain
the argument in the cockpit.

22:55.109 --> 22:57.810
Now, the copilot admits
he shut down the ACARS,

22:57.812 --> 22:59.778
but the grad student
was living with the pilot,

22:59.780 --> 23:02.481
so maybe they were
all in on it.

23:02.483 --> 23:04.316
Hey.

23:05.403 --> 23:09.054
I've been meaning to ask,
how you holding up?

23:09.056 --> 23:12.241
I'm ok. It's never
going to be easy,

23:12.243 --> 23:14.243
but I'm managing.

23:15.613 --> 23:17.913
We just picked up
Cole Marshak.

23:17.915 --> 23:19.248
He was out squirrel hunting.

23:19.250 --> 23:20.749
Didn't even know his brother
had been arrested.

23:20.751 --> 23:24.587
Seems Marshak and his clan,
they're engagers, not instigators.

23:24.589 --> 23:26.255
They'd join a war
but not start it.

23:26.257 --> 23:27.389
Precisely.

23:27.391 --> 23:28.674
And by the way,

23:28.676 --> 23:30.426
we finished going through
the passenger manifest.

23:30.428 --> 23:33.596
No one has been red-flagged
for terrorist connections.

23:33.598 --> 23:35.648
So we're back to
the pilot or copilot.

23:35.650 --> 23:36.599
[Cell phone chimes]

23:36.601 --> 23:39.568
They just found
the black box.

23:42.023 --> 23:44.323
Captain: What did you do
to the autopilot?

23:44.325 --> 23:48.944
Copilot: Nothing. You must have
hit it. It's off now.

23:48.946 --> 23:52.448
No. I can't set
a new altitude.

23:52.450 --> 23:53.666
Are you messing with me?

23:53.668 --> 23:54.783
Calm down.

23:54.785 --> 23:57.419
Don't tell me to calm down.

23:57.421 --> 24:01.624
What the hell?
Why did you deploy the slats?

24:01.626 --> 24:02.791
It just happened.

24:02.793 --> 24:05.461
What are you doing with the yoke?
Just stop it!

24:05.463 --> 24:07.246
I'm trying
to keep her steady.

24:07.248 --> 24:08.714
Ok, this is ridiculous.

24:08.716 --> 24:10.216
Something's buggy
in the system.

24:10.218 --> 24:11.934
Let's reset it all.
Shut everything down.

24:11.936 --> 24:15.971
So they shut down ACARS
just to reset the flight system.

24:15.973 --> 24:19.225
Sounds like there
was a catastrophic system failure.

24:19.227 --> 24:20.859
So that's what
the argument was about.

24:20.861 --> 24:22.611
We just reviewed
the flight data recorder.

24:22.613 --> 24:25.531
The plane porpoised on and off
for the last 3 minutes it was airborne.

24:25.533 --> 24:28.284
But there was no indication
of system or mechanical malfunction.

24:28.286 --> 24:29.885
Everything was working
normally.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.153
Including the autopilot?

24:31.155 --> 24:32.972
'Cause it sounded like
they couldn't override it.

24:32.974 --> 24:35.658
There's one theory
we haven't considered.

24:35.660 --> 24:41.580
Someone other than the pilot
or the copilot was controlling the plane.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.751
It appears
there is one survivor,

24:45.753 --> 24:47.753
possibly the copilot
who...

24:47.755 --> 24:49.221
Ok, let me
get this straight.

24:49.223 --> 24:51.924
The way the plane broke up proves
there was no missile.

24:51.926 --> 24:53.993
The crash was caused
by something internal.

24:53.995 --> 24:55.761
But the pilot and copilot
have been cleared,

24:55.763 --> 24:57.513
so that means
someone from the ground

24:57.515 --> 24:59.765
hacked into
the plane's computers?

24:59.767 --> 25:02.268
It makes sense with
the data from the black box.

25:02.270 --> 25:03.519
Guys, that's a bit
of a reach.

25:03.521 --> 25:05.521
Boeing has expressed
concerns about in-flight

25:05.523 --> 25:07.356
entertainment systems
and USB connections

25:07.358 --> 25:09.942
that could give hackers access
to a plane's computer.

25:09.944 --> 25:13.195
Hack in the box,
Amsterdam, April 2013.

25:13.197 --> 25:15.114
A security consultant
from Germany

25:15.116 --> 25:17.449
demonstrated how an airliner
could be hacked

25:17.451 --> 25:19.918
using a smartphone app
that he developed.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.087
That test was only on
pilot training software.

25:22.089 --> 25:24.290
There's no proof
it could happen in real life.

25:24.292 --> 25:26.925
And we all know how
forthcoming the FAA would be

25:26.927 --> 25:29.595
if something like that
could really happen.

25:29.597 --> 25:33.098
So, what, this unsub
just blew the plane by remote control?

25:33.100 --> 25:34.767
We've seen it before
with a helicopter.

25:34.769 --> 25:37.219
How do we know it wasn't
a crew member or a passenger.

25:37.221 --> 25:39.772
We know for sure
that no one else was in the cockpit.

25:39.774 --> 25:41.307
And it would be hard
to fly by remote control

25:41.309 --> 25:44.059
in a cabin for 13 minutes
and remain unseen.

25:44.061 --> 25:47.613
Not to say that the unsub
isn't connected to someone on the flight.

25:47.615 --> 25:49.782
Who would do something
like this?

25:49.784 --> 25:52.151
A mass annihilator,
someone who enjoys playing God

25:52.153 --> 25:53.736
or some other deity.

25:53.738 --> 25:55.571
We're no longer
looking for a terrorist.

25:55.573 --> 25:57.573
We're looking for
a serial killer

25:57.575 --> 25:59.408
who wants to eradicate life
on a large scale.

25:59.410 --> 26:00.826
And he's not going to
want to stop with this plane.

26:00.828 --> 26:02.244
We need to advise
the president

26:02.246 --> 26:04.246
to ground all flights
immediately.

26:04.248 --> 26:07.383
This is KNBS 27,
and we're here at the crash site.

26:07.385 --> 26:10.586
Obviously you can see...

26:50.993 --> 26:53.110
It's been almost 24 hours
since the crash.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.472
A suspicion of foul play
surrounding flight 420 continues...

26:56.164 --> 26:57.864
Talk of a possible
missile strike,

26:57.866 --> 26:59.783
although nothing
has been confirmed.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.036
There has been no official statement
from the surviving copilot

27:03.038 --> 27:04.204
or his family.

27:04.206 --> 27:05.588
All flights are now grounded

27:05.590 --> 27:07.423
until further notice
from the FAA.

27:07.425 --> 27:08.541
We got there now
live.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.592
[News reports overlapping]

27:09.594 --> 27:11.044
All right, we need to play
up the possibility

27:11.046 --> 27:13.596
of equipment failure so we don't drive
this unsub underground.

27:13.598 --> 27:15.098
I'll let the press
liaison know.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.802
Believe it or not,
the copilot Frank Canvers

27:17.803 --> 27:19.135
started receiving
death threats.

27:19.137 --> 27:21.387
What's the nature
of the threats?

27:21.389 --> 27:23.439
Angry emails and voicemails.
Hang-up calls.

27:23.441 --> 27:25.441
People are upset
that he survived

27:25.443 --> 27:26.893
while everyone else
perished.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.228
It sounds like
the impulsive response

27:28.230 --> 27:29.612
of some grieving
family members.

27:29.614 --> 27:31.447
Still, we need to look
into these threats

27:31.450 --> 27:33.484
and then beef up security
for Canvers and his family.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.901
We'll have someone
on them 24-7.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.569
We should also go through
the passenger manifest again.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.321
Agreed.
Why?

27:38.323 --> 27:40.240
I thought everyone was cleared.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.576
The unsub didn't choose
this flight randomly.

27:43.579 --> 27:46.730
We want to go live now
to Melissa who's in Durango

27:46.731 --> 27:48.498
following late-breaking
events in this crash.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.918
Yes, thank you, David.
Here's the latest update.

27:51.921 --> 27:56.140
The only survivor of Flight 420,
copilot Frank Canvers,

27:56.141 --> 27:58.174
remains hospitalized
at this time.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.760
Doctors have now upgraded
his condition to stable.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.429
Many people have been
calling it a miracle.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.531
Thank you, Melissa.

28:04.555 --> 28:05.983
We'll be getting back to you
throughout the day

28:05.984 --> 28:08.318
to see if there are
any updates on his condition.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.436
We want to go back live
to the crash scene.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.540
We have updated footage
of that disaster.

28:13.542 --> 28:14.908
What have you got, Garcia?

28:14.910 --> 28:16.776
Ok, guess what. I borrowed a page
from the NSA playbook

28:16.778 --> 28:19.662
and I ran everyone
on that plane's text and emails

28:19.664 --> 28:21.247
from the past week
against icky keywords,

28:21.249 --> 28:24.083
late hate and death and suicide,
and here's what I found.

28:24.085 --> 28:27.403
There's a passenger in seat 29-D
by the name of Kristina Morrow

28:27.405 --> 28:30.623
received a text message
3 days prior to the flight that said,

28:30.625 --> 28:34.911
"I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

28:34.913 --> 28:36.196
Oppenheimer.

28:36.198 --> 28:37.547
Where did that text
come from?

28:37.549 --> 28:39.599
From a pre-paid throwaway
cell phone

28:39.601 --> 28:41.134
in Los Alamos, New Mexico.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.969
That was 3 days ago.
This guy could be anywhere.

28:42.971 --> 28:45.855
Do you have any idea
who sent that text, Garcia?

28:45.857 --> 28:48.091
No. This Kristina
seemed super normal.

28:48.093 --> 28:51.644
She was an ICU nurse, married
to an insurance salesman, 3 kids.

28:51.646 --> 28:53.146
[Grunts]
I will keep digging.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.148
All right, thanks.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.481
We got a problem.

28:55.483 --> 28:57.317
All planes over
U.S. airspace right now

28:57.319 --> 28:58.818
have responded to
the order to land,

28:58.820 --> 29:00.737
which one?
Except one.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.822
Interlantic Air
flight number 61.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.491
It left San Diego
at 1405 Zulu,

29:05.493 --> 29:08.328
it's scheduled to land
in Washington D.C. at 1915.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.330
There's 301 passengers
on board.

29:10.332 --> 29:11.998
There's been no
communication from them?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.167
Not since the order
to ground all flights was made.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.135
How long have they
been out of touch?

29:16.137 --> 29:18.504
11 minutes.

29:37.859 --> 29:39.659
We have the latest
from Ashley at the scene.

29:39.661 --> 29:41.110
If you look behind me here,

29:41.112 --> 29:43.579
you can see that the fire
department, the sheriff, the police...

29:43.581 --> 29:46.032
The media's talking more
about equipment failure now.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.533
Good to know some things
go according to plan.

29:47.535 --> 29:50.036
Hopefully the unsub
will poke his head up.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.621
Hey, baby girl,
what do you got?

29:51.623 --> 29:53.356
Kristina Morrow
went on a blind date

29:53.358 --> 29:55.458
with an aerospace engineer
8 years ago.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.876
You're gonna ask me
how I know that,

29:56.878 --> 29:58.428
and I'm gonna tell you
it's because she posted

29:58.430 --> 30:00.997
about the world's
worst blind date on Facebook.

30:00.999 --> 30:02.098
Who is this guy?

30:02.100 --> 30:03.466
His name's Hayman Vasher,

30:03.468 --> 30:06.302
and shortly after this wildly
unromantic and awkward dinner,

30:06.304 --> 30:08.521
he quit his job
and dropped out of society,

30:08.523 --> 30:09.722
like completely.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.057
The way Ted Kaczynski did?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.059
Oh, call them twins.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.528
Both math geniuses,
social outcasts,

30:15.530 --> 30:16.896
anarchist views.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.815
However, Vasher
not anti-technology.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.050
When he was still online,
he posted a lot

30:21.052 --> 30:22.785
about his affinity
for Oppenheimer.

30:22.787 --> 30:26.589
Now the quote
makes complete sense.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.241
If he admires Oppenheimer,

30:28.243 --> 30:30.660
then he wants to destroy
the masses in the same way.

30:30.662 --> 30:33.796
This is his version
of the atomic bomb.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.548
Wait a minute.
All of this was just to get back

30:35.550 --> 30:37.000
at a girl who rejected him?

30:37.002 --> 30:38.501
Doubtful. She was probably
the trigger

30:38.503 --> 30:40.169
that made him drop out
of society, but I'm guessing

30:40.171 --> 30:41.754
if he was solely
focused on her,

30:41.756 --> 30:43.139
he would have struck sooner.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.574
Did I say affinity
for Oppenheimer?

30:44.576 --> 30:46.559
'Cause I'm finding out
more things.

30:46.561 --> 30:48.828
I'm gonna take that back
and call it full-blown obsession.

30:48.830 --> 30:50.346
He analyzed how Oppenheimer

30:50.348 --> 30:52.565
went from being
a socially awkward scientist

30:52.567 --> 30:54.183
to a revered and powerful man

30:54.185 --> 30:56.235
through intellectual
achievement.

30:56.237 --> 30:58.855
Vasher wants to transform
the same way, so for the last 8 years

30:58.857 --> 31:01.357
he's probably been working
on his hacking software.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.493
He just perfected it
and needed a test case.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.162
So why not use
Kristina's flight.

31:06.164 --> 31:09.148
She posted a lot about her trip
on social media.

31:09.150 --> 31:11.818
She was going to a sorority
reunion in Phoenix.

31:11.820 --> 31:13.453
I'm guessing he crashed
the plane here

31:13.455 --> 31:16.005
because it was in range to hack
into the flight system and take control.

31:16.007 --> 31:19.175
And he wanted it to crash nearby
so he could witness it.

31:19.177 --> 31:21.461
It's sparsely
populated here.

31:21.463 --> 31:23.679
If something did
go wrong with the test,

31:23.681 --> 31:26.132
less attention is drawn.

31:26.134 --> 31:31.020
But if this is his Trinity site,
where's his Hiroshima?

31:43.368 --> 31:45.234
We've got a problem
with the radio.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.652
All I'm getting is static.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.038
We entered a new
air traffic region.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.908
They probably sent us
the wrong frequency.

31:51.910 --> 31:54.210
Running through
other channels now.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.879
All flights ordered
to land at nearest airfield.

31:56.881 --> 32:00.049
Disable autopilot
and maintain manual control.

32:00.051 --> 32:03.503
Repeat: Disable autopilot
and maintain manual control.

32:03.505 --> 32:06.339
Albuquerque center
this is IA61, over.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.592
All flights have been
confirmed except IA61.

32:09.594 --> 32:10.594
IA61, come in.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.846
Albuquerque center,
this is IA61, over.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.732
Still no response.
Does anyone have them on radar?

32:16.734 --> 32:20.570
Albuquerque center,
this is IA61. Over.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.356
I'm going to try
center on guard.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.691
121.5.

32:25.693 --> 32:28.277
This is IA61, over.

32:28.279 --> 32:32.865
We have IA61 on radar
entering the ARTCC two minutes ago.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.867
All systems
seem to be functional.

32:34.869 --> 32:38.921
IA61, if you read,
squawk 0-3-6-5

32:38.923 --> 32:40.323
the transponder code
won't change.

32:40.326 --> 32:44.211
Hold on. It looks like the ACARS system
just went down on IA61.

32:44.212 --> 32:47.213
We're gonna land in Flagstaff.
Go direct now.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.800
I'm trying to.
Nothing's working.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.102
I don't get it.
The autopilot's off.

32:53.104 --> 32:55.938
Something's overriding
our commands.

32:58.343 --> 33:01.244
The landing gear's
deploying.

33:05.067 --> 33:07.151
No luck with David Marshak
and his crew.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.318
They claim they never
heard of Hayman Vasher

33:09.320 --> 33:10.620
or anyone fitting
his description.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.238
We may have to go
door to door.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.790
I know it looks empty, but 28 square miles
is a lot of ground to cover.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.292
There's also an extensive
cave system in this region.

33:16.294 --> 33:19.162
You know, we talked about
this crash being a test.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.581
Now, assuming he wanted
total destruction,

33:21.583 --> 33:23.132
you could say he failed.

33:23.134 --> 33:24.800
The copilot survived.
Exactly.

33:24.802 --> 33:27.320
It probably wounded
Vasher's ego.

33:27.322 --> 33:30.473
The unexpected thing that'll
make him break protocol.

33:30.475 --> 33:33.342
So it's possible he made
contact with the copilot.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.478
Maybe a death threat?

33:35.480 --> 33:36.979
Do we have a rundown yet
of all the emails and phone calls

33:36.981 --> 33:38.147
made to the copilot
and his family?

33:38.149 --> 33:39.315
Garcia was looking
into it.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.267
I've just spoken
to the president.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.319
Based on your profile,
we're concerned the next crash

33:43.321 --> 33:46.355
will be in a populated area,
and the president agrees.

33:46.357 --> 33:48.991
He's just given the order
to scramble F-16s.

33:48.993 --> 33:52.995
If we have to, we will
shoot this plane down.

34:06.502 --> 34:08.219
If the unsub wants to
witness this plane crash,

34:08.221 --> 34:09.553
there's not
a lot of time left.

34:09.554 --> 34:11.422
He just entered
Colorado airspace.

34:11.424 --> 34:12.757
That only leaves
about 10 more minutes

34:12.759 --> 34:14.308
if he wants to crash it
into the same area.

34:14.310 --> 34:15.572
Witnessing it may not now

34:15.597 --> 34:17.344
be as important as
making a larger statement.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.146
What's the nearest
high-profile target?

34:19.148 --> 34:20.148
Well...

34:20.149 --> 34:22.983
There's Montezuma Speedway,

34:22.985 --> 34:24.185
Glenwood water park--

34:24.187 --> 34:26.020
oh, God. There's
a big football game

34:26.022 --> 34:27.688
going on right now
at Lewison College.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.024
And there's a great
view of the stadium from Tower Hill.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.826
[Cell phone rings]
Start evacuating it now.

34:31.828 --> 34:32.943
Go ahead, Garcia.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.445
Before you ask,
of course I tried

34:34.447 --> 34:36.496
to hack into IA61's
flight system

34:36.498 --> 34:37.864
and I can't get in.

34:37.867 --> 34:39.533
It's like Vasher built
his own electronic fortress.

34:39.534 --> 34:42.418
The only way it's gonna work is if
someone physically destroys his system.

34:42.420 --> 34:45.255
Have you looked at everyone
who's made contact with the copilot?

34:45.257 --> 34:49.543
Yeah, and they're all friends and family of
passengers except for two.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.378
One is a known conspiracy
theorist from Oregon.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.297
The other is from Colorado.

34:53.299 --> 34:55.933
It's a hang-up call
to his hospital room.

34:55.935 --> 34:58.135
Let me guess--it's from
a prepaid cell phone?

34:58.137 --> 34:59.553
Yep. But I just got
the coordinates

34:59.555 --> 35:01.939
the call originated from and
I'm sending them to you now.

35:01.941 --> 35:03.557
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ
head to Tower Hill.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.559
The rest of us will
go to the coordinates.

35:05.561 --> 35:10.231
This is Red Hawk 5. We are 80 miles
east of target and closing.

35:16.489 --> 35:17.621
We've just
received word that

35:17.623 --> 35:19.673
all flights in the U.S.
have been grounded

35:19.675 --> 35:22.626
until further notice
by the FAA.

35:22.628 --> 35:26.997
Is anyone else,
uh, seeing this?

35:28.568 --> 35:30.467
You need to buckle up.
Please buckle up.

35:30.469 --> 35:32.303
PA: Ladies and gentlemen,
we are experiencing some turbulence.

35:32.305 --> 35:33.504
Excuse me.

35:33.506 --> 35:34.889
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

35:34.891 --> 35:36.257
It's all right.

35:36.259 --> 35:37.424
Excuse me--

35:39.178 --> 35:40.561
ok.

35:44.600 --> 35:48.936
This is Red Hawk 5.
I have visual confirmation.

35:48.938 --> 35:52.022
Agent Hotchner, IA61
just changed course.

35:52.024 --> 35:53.440
It's back on a direct
heading to D.C.

35:53.442 --> 35:54.825
He must have
radar tracking.

35:54.827 --> 35:56.443
He knows the fighter
jets and closing in.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.863
Well, it doesn't get more high profile
than the nation's capital.

35:58.865 --> 36:01.448
So Washington
is his Hiroshima.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.751
It makes sense
in a twisted way.

36:03.753 --> 36:05.619
How long till he gets there?

36:05.621 --> 36:07.705
Assuming the last known
airspeed, about two hours.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.757
He can't possibly think
we'd let the plane get there.

36:09.759 --> 36:13.427
No, but there's a lot of communities
and targets in between.

36:13.429 --> 36:16.931
The hard question is when
to shoot that plane down.

36:20.353 --> 36:22.887
This is Red Hawk 5.
I am locked on target.

36:22.889 --> 36:26.307
I repeat, locked on target.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.091
FBI!

36:57.114 --> 36:58.755
Hayman Vasher, hands
where I can see them!

37:04.180 --> 37:05.462
I don't think so.

37:05.464 --> 37:07.181
Put it down.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.399
Why should I?

37:08.401 --> 37:09.850
If you want glory,
you've already got some.

37:09.852 --> 37:11.685
Stay back or I'll
blow the plane up.

37:11.687 --> 37:13.687
You've proven your point.

37:13.689 --> 37:15.155
You've already destroyed
the plane Kristina was on.

37:15.157 --> 37:16.774
There's no need to kill
hundreds more.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.909
You think
this is about Kristina?

37:19.879 --> 37:21.445
She's nothing.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.864
She's less than
a speck of dirt.

37:23.866 --> 37:25.249
What do you want?

37:25.251 --> 37:27.618
Call off the fighter jets.

get ready to fire.

37:50.109 --> 37:52.443
Roger that.

38:01.587 --> 38:04.204
Look, there's no point
to this.

38:04.206 --> 38:07.458
In the end, Oppenheimer
regretted what he'd done.

38:16.585 --> 38:21.038
Call them off
and I'll let the plane land.

38:22.258 --> 38:23.258

I repeat, pull back.

I don't see anything
on radar.

below range.

do you have visual confirmation?

39:13.025 --> 39:14.942
Negative. I have
no visual confirmation.
