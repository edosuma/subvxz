00:00.333 --> 00:02.801
Libby:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:02.803 --> 00:04.336
You sleep with
your mouth open.

00:04.338 --> 00:07.606
We don't sleep here.
Get dressed.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.708
I saw them last night
leaving the hotel.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.877
<i>How did I not know</i>
<i>they're sleeping together?</i>

00:11.879 --> 00:15.614
I've shared nearly
everything with you.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.182
You should share with me.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.751
Lillian,
I'm not that interesting.

00:18.753 --> 00:21.220
Dr. Masters,
I don't have lice,
I swear.

00:21.222 --> 00:25.090
If you won't sit down, leave.
And you won't be welcome back.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.659
You couldn't have kids?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:27.661 --> 00:29.962
You never would have
married me then.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.497
Tatti greathouse
just called.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.499
<i>She said that</i>
<i>you were fired.</i>

00:33.501 --> 00:34.666
Dr. Greathouse:
No hospital in the midwest

00:34.668 --> 00:36.935
Will even let you
step through their doors.

00:36.937 --> 00:42.241
Why do I have to
hear everything about
my husband thirdhand?

00:42.243 --> 00:44.209
You just have to
trust me right now.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.780
I feel comfortable in speaking
for my partner when I say

00:47.782 --> 00:54.686
How pleased we both are
to be bringing our
work here, together.

00:56.923 --> 00:59.625
(theme music playing)

01:50.977 --> 01:52.644
Virginia: Do you
think he's dreaming?

01:52.646 --> 01:55.481
Libby: I read once that
dogs dream of running

01:55.483 --> 01:57.216
In great open spaces.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.151
How would
they test for that?

01:59.153 --> 02:01.153
In animals or babies?

02:01.155 --> 02:04.990
Are you sure it's okay
that we stopped by this way?

02:04.992 --> 02:06.325
Of course it's okay.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.059
You know how it is.

02:07.061 --> 02:09.962
I was just driving around,
trying to get him to sleep,

02:09.964 --> 02:13.198
And suddenly there we were,
outside your front door.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.433
It's good to see you.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.735
He has much more hair
than last time.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.671
You haven't seen
him in a while.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.641
And I'm sorry for that,
libby. I've been...

02:22.643 --> 02:25.410
You've been busy.
No, I understand.

02:25.412 --> 02:28.714
I wish bill were the type
to show off baby pictures.

02:28.716 --> 02:32.484
I did put one in his
wallet, just in case.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.821
I haven't seen
much of bill either.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.223
That's going
to change, right?

02:40.093 --> 02:43.295
I have to admit, gin,
I was shocked by the news.

02:43.297 --> 02:46.431
Just completely
caught off guard.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.334
Do they know at maternity?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.003
Uh...

02:51.005 --> 02:53.338
About what you two
are doing?

02:53.873 --> 02:56.708
You haven't given
dr. Depaul notice?

02:58.511 --> 02:59.578
Not yet.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.214
I don't blame you waiting
to see if this sticks.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.550
A third hospital
in as many months?

03:04.552 --> 03:07.686
I understand
why it's enticing to him.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.155
To have the study
readily accepted

03:10.157 --> 03:12.457
After the resistance
at memorial.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.592
(stammers) don't take this
the wrong way,

03:13.594 --> 03:18.063
Because baby john
was born there and
I received excellent care.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.332
But bill going to work
at buell green?

03:20.334 --> 03:23.635
I cannot understand it.
Can you?

03:24.103 --> 03:25.571
It's quite a surprise.

03:25.573 --> 03:27.673
He's not just
rolling downhill,
gini,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.041
He's picking up speed.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.109
From chief of obstetrics
at maternity,

03:31.111 --> 03:33.245
To taking a staff position
at memorial,

03:33.247 --> 03:36.114
To walking out and heading
to the negro hospital?

03:36.116 --> 03:38.150
I don't know
what to say, libby.

03:38.152 --> 03:41.820
Where to from here?
The state penitentiary?

03:53.199 --> 03:55.434
(keys clinking)

04:01.674 --> 04:03.308
Have you eaten?

04:03.409 --> 04:05.677
I'm not hungry.

04:08.047 --> 04:11.783
Your way of saying,
"let's skip dinner
and move to dessert?"

04:11.785 --> 04:14.886
Look again,
it's not what you think.

04:14.888 --> 04:19.424
It's the key to
your new office
at buell green.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.525
Not the obvious choice,
I admit.

04:20.527 --> 04:24.196
But they're a fine hospital,
open to new things,

04:24.198 --> 04:27.799
They fully endorse the study
and my bringing you aboard.

04:27.801 --> 04:32.170
That seems like
a decision you could've
discussed with me first.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.905
Maybe. But timing aside,

04:33.907 --> 04:37.542
This is fabulous news.
Calls for a toast.

04:37.544 --> 04:38.277
Uh...

04:38.279 --> 04:40.379
We can finally
get back to work.

04:40.381 --> 04:45.284
And you can stop selling
those ridiculous diet pills.

04:46.653 --> 04:47.252
I'm sorry, bill.

04:47.254 --> 04:51.223
How did you see
me coming aboard
at buell green?

04:51.225 --> 04:52.557
What do you mean?

04:52.559 --> 04:54.459
I mean, as what?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.428
What is my official title?

04:56.430 --> 04:58.397
My responsibilities?
My salary?

04:58.399 --> 05:01.099
We work all that out,
of course.

05:01.101 --> 05:01.967
When?

05:01.969 --> 05:08.140
I'd like to know those
things before I decide
to upend my life.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.910
I want to be very clear
on what you're offering me.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.514
How about an opportunity
to finish what we started?

05:15.516 --> 05:16.748
How about the study?

05:16.750 --> 05:21.953
I would just
like the specifics
spelled out, ahead of time.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.122
In writing.

05:26.626 --> 05:28.260
I see.

05:28.262 --> 05:30.362
As I've proven
myself untrustworthy.

05:30.364 --> 05:34.299
Because I have two children
I'm supporting.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.834
If you end up
leaving this hospital,

05:35.836 --> 05:39.004
Like you left the last one
and the one before that,

05:39.006 --> 05:43.175
What guarantee do I have
they will keep me on
without you?

05:43.177 --> 05:46.778
I don't have the luxury
of jumping ship on a whim.

05:46.780 --> 05:50.615
I don't have the luxury
of not selling those
ridiculous diet pills.

05:50.617 --> 05:54.019
I don't understand.
You shouldn't assume
I'll just come

05:54.021 --> 05:56.488
Running whenever
you call, bill.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.123
I do have other opportunities.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.258
And they are?
I'd like to know.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.363
What opportunities
do you have outside
of diet pills?

06:04.365 --> 06:05.430
A job with lillian.

06:05.432 --> 06:09.234
She's doing very
important work.
Work I'm very much part of.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.803
I'm sure she'd make it
worth my while to stay.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.239
I don't think
you want to
play that hand.

06:14.241 --> 06:14.840
It's not a hand.

06:14.842 --> 06:19.544
I don't think lillian
regards you quite
as highly as you think.

06:19.645 --> 06:23.548
Why do you say that?
She knows about us.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.952
About the work we're doing.

06:28.187 --> 06:29.821
Upstairs.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.762
Gene, your side of the bed
is gonna turn to stone

06:36.764 --> 06:39.965
If you don't start
sleeping in it again.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.502
(sighs)

06:44.904 --> 06:50.375
<i>â™ª you're the top</i>
<i>you're the colosseum</i>

06:50.377 --> 06:52.878
<i>â™ª you're the top</i>

06:53.279 --> 06:55.380
<i>â™ª you're the louvre museum</i>

06:55.382 --> 07:01.353
<i>â™ª you're</i>
<i>a melody from a symphony</i>
<i>by somebody</i>

07:01.355 --> 07:05.157
<i>â™ª you're a something bonnet</i>

07:05.159 --> 07:08.560
<i>â™ª you're mickey mouse</i>

07:08.995 --> 07:10.962
<i>â™ª you're the nile</i>

07:10.964 --> 07:13.231
<i>â™ª you're the tower of pizza</i>

07:13.233 --> 07:14.399
<i>â™ª you're the smile...</i>

07:14.401 --> 07:15.901
Come on, smile.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.936
<i>â™ª ...On the mona lisa</i>

07:18.104 --> 07:21.573
<i>â™ª I'm a total wreck</i>
<i>I'm a worthless check,</i>

<i>â™ª but if, baby,</i>

07:26.379 --> 07:28.580
(clears throat)

07:34.086 --> 07:35.053
Gene, honey.

07:35.055 --> 07:39.224
I want you to take my hand,
come upstairs with me.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.659
We can gargle, we can...

07:40.661 --> 07:42.828
(sighs) ah, christ,
come on. Betty.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.597
I don't know
which way is up now.

07:45.765 --> 07:46.264
That way?

07:46.266 --> 07:49.568
What are you getting at with,
"come upstairs with me"?

07:49.570 --> 07:50.435
That you love me, huh?

07:50.437 --> 07:52.337
You sing me a song,
try to seduce me?

07:52.339 --> 07:54.840
Though your voice sounds
like migrating geese.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.475
First, I was
miss melba snyder

07:56.477 --> 07:59.678
In my high school
production of  <i>pal joey.</i>

07:59.680 --> 08:01.012
Before they booted me out.

08:01.014 --> 08:05.150
And second of all,
you know who you married.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.318
Yes, I got the message.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.520
You're sore
'cause I can't have kids.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.222
I'm sore 'cause you lied.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.056
So yell at me.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.859
Slam some doors, come up
with some other idea.

08:13.861 --> 08:18.763
Like we adopt or something,
instead of freezing me out.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.999
You want to adopt?

08:21.701 --> 08:23.268
Do you?

08:23.270 --> 08:25.737
No. Not if it's...

08:25.739 --> 08:29.741
Another sing-along
or another
invitation up to bed.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.710
Gene, honey...

08:32.178 --> 08:34.412
I want us to be happy.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.280
I want you to be happy.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.216
If that means bringing in
kids that aren't ours,

08:38.218 --> 08:40.652
But would become ours...

08:40.654 --> 08:42.354
Once we love them.

08:43.222 --> 08:46.892
Once we love them.
Then, yeah.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.994
I could do that.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.636
I got to think about that.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.738
Yeah?

09:00.439 --> 09:02.040
Okay?

09:02.174 --> 09:03.742
Okay.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.213
(indistinct conversations)

09:10.349 --> 09:15.654
I'm hoping you'll
find the office suits
your needs, dr. Masters.

09:21.160 --> 09:22.761
It's, uh...

09:26.165 --> 09:27.165
It'll be fine.

09:27.167 --> 09:31.169
And the dedicated
exam room
I'd requested?

09:31.171 --> 09:32.504
Next door.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.539
Although I confess, bill,

09:34.541 --> 09:37.042
I ruffled a few feathers
to get that done.

09:37.044 --> 09:37.842
Space here is at a premium.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.545
I'm sure once the staff
sees the volume of patients,

09:40.547 --> 09:43.582
Study subjects
coming in and out
of my exam room,

09:43.584 --> 09:45.850
They'll understand
why it's a necessity.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.919
I'm counting on
that being the case.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.956
Another thing
while you're here,
charles.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.290
Um...

09:52.292 --> 09:55.260
My associate,
mrs. Johnson.

09:55.262 --> 09:55.894
Mmm-hmm?

09:55.896 --> 09:59.364
She's going to require
an employment contract.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.767
We don't offer contracts
to any of our support staff.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.902
Guarantee is week-to-week.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.805
I'd appreciate you
making an exception.

10:06.807 --> 10:10.175
Seeing as she's essential
to my work.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.443
(knocking on door)

10:11.445 --> 10:13.878
Am I intruding?
No, no.

10:14.113 --> 10:14.846
Come in, cyril.

10:14.848 --> 10:18.783
I wanted to
introduce myself.
Cyril franklin.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.418
Bill masters.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.786
A pleasure.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.288
Gynecology?

10:23.290 --> 10:23.755
Yes.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.890
We'll be sharing
a waiting room.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.727
I've followed your work
with great interest.

10:28.729 --> 10:32.263
I'm looking forward
to get the staff
along in that area.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.932
If you need
to refer patients,

10:33.934 --> 10:37.369
I'll do whatever I can
to accommodate them.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.204
That's...

10:40.439 --> 10:41.840
Thank you.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.376
Anything I can do to help.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.648
And are your offices
also the size

10:49.650 --> 10:52.651
Of a rabbit hutch,
dr. Franklin?

10:53.152 --> 10:55.186
My offices were
next door, in what

10:55.188 --> 10:57.322
Is now
the dedicated exam room.

10:57.324 --> 11:01.760
My new offices,
they're more suited
to mice.

11:05.765 --> 11:08.233
(phone ringing)

11:11.837 --> 11:14.339
Aren't you going to...

11:15.441 --> 11:17.742
(ringing continues)

11:18.477 --> 11:20.979
Dr. Depaul's office.

11:23.149 --> 11:24.683
I see.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.085
Well, thank you.

11:27.987 --> 11:31.222
Man down in mimeo
says he has 10 minutes
between jobs

11:31.224 --> 11:33.591
If you can
get him those...

11:33.593 --> 11:35.493
Those... (sighs)

11:36.162 --> 11:38.563
Does it matter
what I did
outside the office

11:38.565 --> 11:41.766
As long as I'm
good at my job here?

11:46.305 --> 11:50.675
I think it would matter
very much to libby masters.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.744
Bill and I are not
having an affair.

11:52.746 --> 11:56.514
I don't think piling lies
on top of other
lies is really...

11:56.516 --> 12:01.720
Our participation
in the study has
been unorthodox.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.387
I'll admit that.

12:02.389 --> 12:06.091
Is that how bill
pitches it? You're
subjects in his study?

12:06.093 --> 12:07.659
Our study.

12:07.661 --> 12:10.295
We are tracking
the same physiological data

12:10.297 --> 12:11.696
As we would with
any participant.

12:11.698 --> 12:17.202
Let me understand.
It's okay because
you're taking notes?

12:17.636 --> 12:19.971
Whatever it is or is not,

12:19.973 --> 12:22.941
I have never let it
interfere with my job.

12:22.943 --> 12:27.078
And yet you gave away
your study, why?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.246
To punish me? For what?

12:28.248 --> 12:29.647
For something
I may have done

12:29.649 --> 12:32.684
That doesn't reflect
the quality of my work?

12:32.686 --> 12:34.185
You're smarter than that.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.620
This isn't
about intelligence.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.656
You were capable of waiting
for a job that you earned

12:38.658 --> 12:39.924
Based on your abilities.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.694
I have two children
I'm supporting!

12:42.696 --> 12:44.896
I don't have
the luxury of waiting.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.331
What you've done
makes it harder

12:46.333 --> 12:47.899
For every woman
who comes after you.

12:47.901 --> 12:51.035
Easier for a man who has
designs on that woman.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.138
You have to have
a lot of money

12:53.140 --> 12:56.341
To wait for the perfect
job opportunity.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.108
Come from a good family,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.611
Have parents willing
to pay for medical school...

12:59.613 --> 13:02.180
If you're intimating
I had it easy...

13:02.182 --> 13:04.048
Not easy. Easier.

13:04.050 --> 13:04.849
You had it easier.

13:04.851 --> 13:07.085
You're in no position
to judge me.

13:07.087 --> 13:07.685
Nor you, me.

13:07.687 --> 13:10.155
You think I'd
throw away my work
to spite you?

13:10.157 --> 13:13.191
Because I disapprove
of your personal life?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.325
Isn't that what you've done?

13:14.327 --> 13:17.262
You're the girl upset
she wasn't asked
to the dance

13:17.264 --> 13:20.031
By the boy she didn't
want to go with.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.232
What does that mean?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.033
You're upset I gave my work

13:22.035 --> 13:24.502
To someone who could
secure its future,

13:24.504 --> 13:27.238
As if you ever truly
wanted the responsibility.

13:27.240 --> 13:30.909
Why would I ever entrust
my life's work to you?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.644
When, admit it,
you were always

13:32.646 --> 13:36.314
Going to leave me
and follow bill.
(scoffs)

13:38.317 --> 13:41.686
I'm going down to mimeo
to drop off these reports.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.087
Don't perpetuate
the sick belief

13:43.089 --> 13:47.792
That women need to
open their legs
to get a leg up!

13:47.893 --> 13:49.894
Oh, my goodness!

13:50.563 --> 13:52.897
Oh, that is so...

13:54.066 --> 13:57.502
You're so unlucky.
Did it hurt?

13:57.504 --> 13:58.970
Does he see me?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.271
Is it a she?

14:00.273 --> 14:04.309
No, don't go.
We are listening.
We are.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.278
Oh...

14:07.413 --> 14:10.448
Raspberries. We lost him.
Oh.

14:10.549 --> 14:14.953
It happens.
You have be very quiet.
It's...

14:14.955 --> 14:16.821
It's not that
they're shy or anything,

14:16.823 --> 14:20.558
It has to do with
energy channels.
Mmm-hmm.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.528
Gene: Hey.
My god!

14:23.530 --> 14:25.697
Betts, your friend
helen told me

14:25.699 --> 14:29.133
We have a ghost
in our living room.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.502
Oh, really.
How do we
get rid of it?

14:31.504 --> 14:32.670
Oh, no, you mustn't.

14:32.672 --> 14:36.040
He's such a sweet old man.
His name is paul.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.376
Or saul.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.945
It's paul.
He lived until
he was 93.

14:40.947 --> 14:42.046
Then choked on
a chicken bone.

14:42.048 --> 14:45.316
You never told me
you had a friend
that had...

14:45.318 --> 14:46.551
What did
you call it?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.185
Oh, precognitions.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.588
This morning,
buttering my toast,
thinking of nothing,

14:50.590 --> 14:52.891
And all of
a sudden it came to me,

14:52.893 --> 14:54.325
"hunt down betty dimello."

14:54.327 --> 14:55.827
Moretti.

14:55.829 --> 14:58.263
It's betty moretti now.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.132
Yeah. So you guys
are friends from...

15:01.134 --> 15:01.933
Acquaintances, really.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.402
Oh, we go way back.
Betty: Mmm-hmm.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.172
Same gal does
our hair at clarise's.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.808
Now, betty, gene
seems very open.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.077
We can tell him
the truth, huh?

15:13.079 --> 15:16.814
Several years ago,
betty saw my sign
in the window.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.918
A palm, naturally,
outlined in neon.
Okay.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.021
And she came in
and wanted to have
her palm read.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.457
Well, it turns out
she has a very
long love line.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.627
Is that right?
Oh, yes, look...

15:29.629 --> 15:30.795
Uh...

15:30.797 --> 15:33.364
Here it is.
See? There.

15:33.632 --> 15:35.767
It means true love.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.269
A long love,
meant to last the ages.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.539
Gene: Well,
that would be us,
right? (laughs)

15:41.541 --> 15:42.407
How we met.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.608
Aw...
Look at that,
it was there

15:43.610 --> 15:46.544
(laughing)
on your hand
the whole time.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.078
Yeah.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.047
I have someone
I think would love you.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.381
Know who?
I can't imagine.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.917
My friend al,
known him
since sixth grade.

15:52.919 --> 15:55.086
He's a bit of a goof,
but has a heart of gold.

15:55.088 --> 15:58.289
I really think al
would love helen.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.125
I'll make a reservation
for us four at kemoll's.

16:01.127 --> 16:01.993
Gene, don't be cuckoo.
Ooh!

16:01.995 --> 16:04.662
No. This is
my precondition.
(laughs) precognition.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.765
Unless of course you
have a special someone.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.300
No. I was recently jilted.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.201
Gene: Al, too!
That's good!

16:10.203 --> 16:13.938
So you both are in need
of good fortune in
the love department.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.240
Al, his girlfriend
just dumped him.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.543
She got the shingles,
blamed it all on al.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.145
But she's a little,
you know, ooh-yoy!

16:21.147 --> 16:22.413
Gene, honey, I...

16:22.415 --> 16:24.549
I don't think
helen wants to go

16:24.551 --> 16:26.751
On a double date
with us and al...

16:26.753 --> 16:27.819
I would love to.

16:27.821 --> 16:31.089
What does a girl
wear to kemoll's?

16:35.728 --> 16:41.132
No matter how long you
stare, it's not going
to unpack itself.

16:48.874 --> 16:49.941
Uh...

16:49.943 --> 16:51.976
Human resources
drew up a contract

16:51.978 --> 16:55.513
Specifying the details
of your employment,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.149
If you'd like to peruse.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.304
Your office is...

17:21.006 --> 17:22.840
It's in there.

17:23.008 --> 17:26.110
Next door there's
a dedicated exam room,

17:27.379 --> 17:29.881
With a viewing area.

17:30.582 --> 17:34.952
Raising the question
of where we'll be
resuming our sessions.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.854
Here or...

17:36.856 --> 17:39.690
At the hotel.
I'm amenable to either.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.660
I was wondering
if there's a third option.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.929
Oh? Which would be...

17:44.931 --> 17:46.431
To stop.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.770
We've been at this
a while now.

17:52.772 --> 17:58.042
At some point,
haven't we exhausted
the possibilities...

17:58.877 --> 18:00.645
Of sexual research?
That's like saying

18:00.647 --> 18:03.014
One's done mapping
the milky way.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.050
Yes. Maybe...

18:06.052 --> 18:09.654
Maybe if we took some time
to reassess our objectives.

18:09.656 --> 18:13.658
And what objectives, exactly,
are you referring to?

18:13.660 --> 18:16.227
The scope
of our involvement.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.528
The terms...

18:17.530 --> 18:19.931
We're back to terms now?

18:21.100 --> 18:24.769
I suppose I'm wondering
if our personal
participation

18:24.771 --> 18:28.706
Is a condition
of my employment here?

18:37.216 --> 18:38.649
No.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.088
Then maybe
it's better if we...

18:44.090 --> 18:46.124
What I meant was yes.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.496
Yes. It is part of the job.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.037
Hotel, then.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.197
Aren't you going to
take off your clothes?

19:27.399 --> 19:28.699
No.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.436
Because...

19:32.838 --> 19:35.039
I don't want to.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.175
(exhales)

19:37.177 --> 19:40.044
So, what are we...

19:40.679 --> 19:43.047
I want you to strip.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.619
(chuckles nervously)

20:36.368 --> 20:38.269
No, stand.

20:44.376 --> 20:47.778
Now you're going
to touch yourself.

21:23.682 --> 21:25.483
Begin.
(ticking)

21:38.530 --> 21:44.201
You've closed your eyes.
Is that standard
behavior for you?

21:44.670 --> 21:47.505
(clears throat)
I believe it is.

21:49.941 --> 21:53.277
Is that to
facilitate fantasy?

21:53.845 --> 21:55.012
(breathing heavily)

21:55.014 --> 21:58.149
It's an automatic reflex,

21:58.151 --> 22:01.285
Not a conscious process.

22:01.287 --> 22:03.654
But...

22:04.122 --> 22:05.122
Yes, I suppose so.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.558
And what are you
thinking about?

22:21.506 --> 22:23.341
You.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.148
You can stop
touching yourself.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.983
But I haven't yet...

22:32.985 --> 22:34.352
Stop.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.965
Come here.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.094
Take them off.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.407
(gasps)

23:40.452 --> 23:42.486
(virginia moaning)

23:46.525 --> 23:48.726
(woman chattering on pa)

23:52.564 --> 23:53.063
Excuse me.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.966
This x-ray solution
needs to get to radiology.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.201
Where is radiology?

23:57.203 --> 24:02.072
No idea at all.
I'm sorry. I'm new here.

24:06.745 --> 24:08.446
Excuse me.

24:14.352 --> 24:15.553
Good morning.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.288
Good morning.

24:17.756 --> 24:21.358
I put up some
fliers for the study
on my way in.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.560
Good.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.162
As for today's business,
you have the patient list?

24:25.164 --> 24:28.466
I intend to
call this morning,
starting with the a's.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.835
I'll inform them
of the new location

24:30.837 --> 24:33.838
And start scheduling
appointments as early as...

24:33.840 --> 24:37.641
Today is fine.
Our doors are open.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.419
Libby: I'm not
sure I understand.

24:48.421 --> 24:50.020
Robert: I came to
talk about coral.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.555
Coral? Is she not
coming today?

24:51.557 --> 24:54.692
No, I put her on the bus.
I just came on ahead myself.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.961
I was hoping to have
a word with you.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.128
Has something
happened to coral?

24:58.130 --> 25:04.268
She told me something
recently that I just
can't seem to shake.

25:04.736 --> 25:06.570
Every night I ask her
how her day was,

25:06.572 --> 25:10.441
And normally she just says,
"fine," you know. "good."

25:10.443 --> 25:12.543
And she loves that baby john.

25:12.545 --> 25:14.512
Thinks that little one
walks on water.

25:14.514 --> 25:15.846
Then the other night,
she told me that

25:15.848 --> 25:21.485
Someone forced her head
under a faucet
and scrubbed at it.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.588
I had to wash her hair.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.423
My infant son had lice.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.660
That must have been
upsetting for you.

25:29.662 --> 25:30.594
It was.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.997
And upsetting for coral.

25:36.067 --> 25:37.701
So that's it really.

25:37.703 --> 25:41.005
I'm gonna keep
on asking coral
how her day was.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.540
And she's gonna
keep telling me.

25:42.542 --> 25:45.442
And hopefully
she'll just say
"fine" and "good."

25:45.444 --> 25:47.678
And whatever
that problem was,

25:48.513 --> 25:51.415
Well, it won't
happen again.

25:51.816 --> 25:53.918
Now she doesn't
know I stopped by.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.288
So you can go and
can keep that between us.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.723
Thank you for
your time, ma'am.

26:13.605 --> 26:14.738
(door opening)

26:14.740 --> 26:16.340
(bell jingling)

26:16.342 --> 26:18.108
(door closing)

26:20.812 --> 26:22.479
The lines in your
palm don't change,

26:22.481 --> 26:24.715
If you're looking
for a reading.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.483
That was
some stunt, helen.

26:26.485 --> 26:28.419
So what is it
you want? Money?

26:28.421 --> 26:30.020
I already gave you
plenty of money.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.157
Yes, I seem to remember
you throwing $100 bills

26:33.159 --> 26:34.825
Out of your new cadillac
as you drove away.

26:34.827 --> 26:38.162
That is unfair.
I couldn't sleep
for months.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.196
I still can't!

26:39.198 --> 26:41.031
Well, that makes two of us.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.703
You broke my heart.

26:47.739 --> 26:51.375
We agreed me marrying gene
was the best thing.

26:51.377 --> 26:52.376
You agreed.

26:52.378 --> 26:55.279
We agreed there
is no future here.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.215
Years and years,
going out together
as what? What?

26:58.217 --> 27:01.485
Two spinster friends?
Or living together
like sisters?

27:01.487 --> 27:03.454
Or going to bars where
a butch won't serve us

27:03.456 --> 27:07.758
'cause we're not wearing
ducktails and gabardines?

27:07.760 --> 27:10.761
It's pathetic, helen.

27:10.862 --> 27:11.795
We both like dresses.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.999
So we just got
to have to buck up

27:15.001 --> 27:17.101
And do the right thing.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.303
The right thing for you.

27:21.573 --> 27:25.075
You are a cynical woman,
mrs. Moretti.

27:25.077 --> 27:31.415
What I am is a woman
who has fucked men
for money.

27:31.417 --> 27:32.116
Hundreds of them.

27:32.118 --> 27:36.086
I have seen things
and I have done
things and...

27:36.088 --> 27:38.455
I am not apologizing
for this.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.857
'cause I got
gold faucets now,

27:39.859 --> 27:41.125
A hat for every
day of the week.

27:41.127 --> 27:44.261
And I can eat
beef bourguignon
for lunch if I want.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.498
You still got
to sleep with him
and not me.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.733
Well, nothing comes free.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.536
Then maybe it will work out
for me, too, with al.

27:52.538 --> 27:56.807
You are not going out
with al. You are
canceling that date.

27:56.809 --> 27:57.808
I am not canceling.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.343
Stop screwing around, helen.

27:59.345 --> 28:00.577
I'm following your lead.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.646
You are not coming
back into my life

28:02.648 --> 28:05.449
After the hell it took
getting you out.

28:06.584 --> 28:07.618
Fuck you, betty.

28:07.620 --> 28:12.022
You got to grab
the brass ring.
And now it's my turn.

28:15.560 --> 28:17.594
Our process
hasn't changed since

28:17.596 --> 28:20.064
You had your daughter,
mrs. Tillingsworth.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.434
You'll schedule
regular capping
sessions.

28:23.436 --> 28:26.236
And will the procedure
last as long as before?

28:26.238 --> 28:27.438
All those hours
lying still?

28:27.440 --> 28:30.808
Some women trying
for a second kid
look forward to it.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.210
They say it's
the only rest they get.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.547
What if I go home
immediately
after the capping

28:36.549 --> 28:37.581
And do my bed
rest there?

28:37.583 --> 28:40.417
You had such a good outcome
the first time around.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.853
Why tamper with success?

28:43.254 --> 28:46.090
Earl got me a new car.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.660
And I don't feel comfortable
leaving it on the street.

28:49.662 --> 28:51.428
Not for hours on end.

28:51.430 --> 28:52.963
Not in this neighborhood.

28:52.965 --> 28:56.934
I park downstairs
without giving it a thought.

28:57.068 --> 29:00.137
My car is an eldorado.

29:00.605 --> 29:03.974
Mrs. Johnson's car
is also a...

29:05.110 --> 29:05.843
Ford.

29:05.845 --> 29:09.847
But it is a very lovely
shade of capri blue.

29:09.849 --> 29:13.984
You don't expect to be here
permanently, do you, doctor?

29:13.986 --> 29:16.754
Buell green is
a fine hospital,
mrs. Tillingsworth.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.522
Do you imagine
I would be here otherwise?

29:18.524 --> 29:21.158
That I would be satisfied
offering my patients

29:21.160 --> 29:24.528
Anything less than
the care that they expect?

29:25.363 --> 29:28.298
No. Of course not.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.902
My car has leather seats.

29:31.904 --> 29:37.141
You have a healthy,
beautiful baby girl
who deserves a sibling.

29:37.143 --> 29:42.212
Now, which one of
those two problems
would you like to focus on?

29:50.522 --> 29:54.525
Your young man
paid me a visit today.
(clears throat)

29:54.859 --> 29:57.227
I'm sorry, ma'am. Robert?

29:57.595 --> 29:59.630
Coral, I'm older than you
and I know

29:59.632 --> 30:02.733
A thing or two
about the world.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.270
Well, why don't you
sit down a moment?

30:13.478 --> 30:15.612
I know you have no mother
to guide you.

30:15.614 --> 30:19.650
So I'm just going to
tell you this. Directly.

30:20.351 --> 30:23.654
I'm worried about you
being with this boy.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.591
He came here to,

30:28.259 --> 30:30.894
Well, essentially
to threaten me.

30:30.896 --> 30:32.329
I'm not going to
call the police.

30:32.331 --> 30:35.999
I'm not even sure
I'm going to tell
dr. Masters.

30:36.001 --> 30:38.101
But I will tell you.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.804
I think robert
is very angry.

30:40.806 --> 30:44.208
He's trying to hide it,
but it's very obvious to me.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.976
I could feel it.

30:45.978 --> 30:47.244
So under the circumstances,

30:47.246 --> 30:49.079
I think it's best
if you put some

30:49.081 --> 30:51.114
Distance between
you and robert.

30:51.116 --> 30:52.516
Just ease him out gently.

30:52.518 --> 30:55.953
Perhaps start seeing
a little less of him.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.222
We live together.

31:01.392 --> 31:05.095
And I should leave him.
I certainly should.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.599
Like you say,
he is a rough customer,
robert.

31:08.601 --> 31:12.502
And he does have a temper,
there's no doubt.

31:12.504 --> 31:15.372
And sometimes we fight.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.542
But then,

31:19.711 --> 31:21.545
When it's late,

31:21.547 --> 31:26.683
And it's the two of us,
alone, in our bed,

31:27.118 --> 31:30.587
Well, all the bad stuff
just goes away.

31:34.125 --> 31:38.362
He's real soft
with his hands.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.364
And his lips.

31:40.932 --> 31:46.436
The way he touches me,
his breath in my ear...

31:46.438 --> 31:47.604
(exclaims)

31:47.606 --> 31:52.943
Well, I'm sure
you can understand how
hard that is to leave.

31:52.945 --> 31:55.979
You being
a woman of the world.

31:58.816 --> 32:02.252
But I will think about
what you said.

32:02.254 --> 32:07.024
And once I'm finished
making dr. Masters' bed,

32:07.026 --> 32:09.593
Should I make yours, too?

32:13.831 --> 32:16.099
(indistinct conversations)

32:25.176 --> 32:27.678
(woman chattering on pa)

32:37.822 --> 32:41.124
We went through
the first run of
fliers already?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.593
The first ones
have all been taken.

32:43.595 --> 32:47.297
Unfortunately, to the dump,
just south of the city.

32:47.299 --> 32:50.000
A man watched me
as I put one up.

32:50.002 --> 32:51.935
I could tell
he didn't approve.

32:51.937 --> 32:55.072
Apparently, he took matters
into his own hands

32:55.074 --> 32:57.708
To save the world
from our immoral ways.

32:57.710 --> 32:59.009
What man?
I'll talk to hendricks.

32:59.011 --> 33:01.712
He guaranteed me
we wouldn't be
interfered with.

33:01.714 --> 33:04.815
A delivery man.
He had this scowl
on his face.

33:04.817 --> 33:08.752
Very much like the scowl
we've seen on
some of our patients

33:08.754 --> 33:11.455
Since we landed here.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.422
I honestly think

33:12.424 --> 33:14.458
It's going to
take some effort

33:14.460 --> 33:16.727
To get willing subjects
back into the study.

33:16.729 --> 33:18.962
We may lose
some of our regulars

33:18.964 --> 33:22.265
'cause they don't want
to make the drive to
this neighborhood.

33:22.267 --> 33:26.236
Which means most of
the study will be made up
of negro subjects.

33:26.238 --> 33:29.339
As one would expect
at a negro hospital.

33:29.341 --> 33:30.273
Which begs the question,

33:30.275 --> 33:32.509
If our study subjects
are primarily colored,

33:32.511 --> 33:35.145
Do we include their data
in with everyone else's?

33:35.147 --> 33:38.882
As opposed to what?
Separating our
subjects by race?

33:38.884 --> 33:40.751
We've never included
negroes before.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.652
We've never
excluded them, either.

33:42.654 --> 33:47.157
They simply had no exposure
to our recruitment efforts

33:47.159 --> 33:48.091
At a white hospital.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.793
Now that we're here...
Just asking

33:49.795 --> 33:51.995
If there's any value
in separating them,

33:51.997 --> 33:53.263
From a research
point of view?

33:53.265 --> 33:55.165
Looking at them apart
from caucasian data?

33:55.167 --> 33:58.602
You do realize they have
the same physiology,
don't you?

33:58.604 --> 34:00.737
The difference
is merely melanin,
skin pigment.

34:00.739 --> 34:04.374
Would you argue that
our brown-eyed
subjects are sexually

34:04.376 --> 34:06.643
Distinct from
our blue-eyed ones?

34:06.645 --> 34:07.110
No.

34:07.112 --> 34:10.414
But in this case,
people think
there's a difference.

34:10.416 --> 34:11.515
(phone ringing)
sexually speaking.

34:11.517 --> 34:15.085
True or not, I wonder
if it's worth
our consideration.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.287
Dr. Masters' office.

34:17.289 --> 34:21.291
Yes, mrs. Kenworthy.
That's fine. We can...

34:23.928 --> 34:27.297
All right.
Thank you.

34:27.932 --> 34:30.400
Mrs. Kenworthy just
canceled her appointment.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.602
When does she
want to reschedule?

34:32.604 --> 34:34.638
She doesn't.

34:40.378 --> 34:45.048
Some people use sex
as a way to make up.

34:45.050 --> 34:47.484
Have you found
that to be true?

34:49.887 --> 34:50.821
Uh...

34:50.823 --> 34:54.925
(stammers) I'm not sure
I have found it.

34:54.927 --> 34:59.563
Don't you think
there's something
healthy about that?

34:59.797 --> 35:02.699
Healthy? In the sense of...

35:02.701 --> 35:07.003
A good way for
a couple to iron out
their differences.

35:07.005 --> 35:12.042
I mean,
it's not something we do.
But maybe we should.

35:12.044 --> 35:13.877
I'm not angry with you.

35:13.879 --> 35:16.313
You know what they say...

35:16.315 --> 35:19.549
Love and hate are
two sides of the same coin.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.586
Have you been
talking to someone?

35:22.588 --> 35:25.055
What is that
supposed to mean?

35:25.057 --> 35:29.126
That I just stay
at home and live
this sheltered life?

35:29.128 --> 35:34.965
I know about the world.
I see things
and I hear things.

35:34.967 --> 35:38.368
So are you angry with me?

35:40.371 --> 35:42.906
Yes. I am.

35:43.341 --> 35:44.708
A little.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.477
And in the interest
of marital health,

35:47.479 --> 35:50.747
I think we should
patch things up.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.625
(dr. Masters grunting)

36:14.305 --> 36:16.473
Should I slow down?

36:16.475 --> 36:21.745
It happened already.
I was just very quiet.
The baby.

36:24.749 --> 36:27.083
(continues grunting)

36:46.337 --> 36:48.405
I called a taxi.

36:48.407 --> 36:49.306
I assumed
you weren't coming.

36:49.308 --> 36:54.211
Because I'm the type of
person who skips out
on a cancer patient?

36:54.213 --> 36:55.645
Get in.

37:01.752 --> 37:03.887
(indistinct conversations)

37:26.744 --> 37:29.813
From now on,
please don't worry
about this room.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.315
I'll take care of it.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.284
Yes, ma'am.

38:00.044 --> 38:01.411
(door opening)

38:01.413 --> 38:03.246
(vacuum jangling)

38:10.688 --> 38:12.789
(vacuum whirring)

38:24.068 --> 38:25.835
Betty, I'm...

38:29.507 --> 38:31.708
Betty!
What?

38:39.583 --> 38:40.717
(whirring stops)

38:40.719 --> 38:42.652
What are you doing?
Vacuuming.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.188
(laughs) vacuuming.
In all the time
I've known you,

38:45.190 --> 38:47.223
I've never seen you
near a vacuum.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.692
Let alone push
one around.

38:48.694 --> 38:49.359
I have too vacuumed.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.328
That vacuum has
two inches of dust on it.

38:51.330 --> 38:52.829
That's how much
cleaning you do.

38:52.831 --> 38:56.533
I'm burning off,
you know, (shudders)
anxiety.

38:56.535 --> 39:00.870
'cause of what I didn't
tell you. About helen.
Uh-huh.

39:00.872 --> 39:03.506
Truth is she's... Ooh.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.774
She's not so good
at bathing.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.644
Ah!
A sponge bath
every couple weeks maybe.

39:07.646 --> 39:10.780
And come summer,
she's like french cheese.

39:10.782 --> 39:11.614
I didn't notice anything.

39:11.616 --> 39:15.752
Al will notice. You
know how vain he is
about his women.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.854
And you know about
napoleon and josephine.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.457
The more she stank,
the more he loved her.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.859
Let al and helen
work it out.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.427
(stammering) it's just...

39:24.429 --> 39:29.766
It's like the smell
reflects what's,
you know, inside.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.601
Like she's rotten.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.202
As a person.

39:32.204 --> 39:33.837
I thought
she was your friend.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.639
What does that word
even mean anymore?

39:36.641 --> 39:38.541
Plus I got
a conscience, gene,

39:38.543 --> 39:44.381
And I can't sit by
and watch helen
get her hooks into al.

39:44.448 --> 39:46.082
(sighs) hooks?
Oh. Oh!

39:46.084 --> 39:48.651
Hooves more like it,
because

39:48.653 --> 39:50.387
She also has
a gambling problem.

39:50.389 --> 39:52.989
Spends 90% of her time
at the tracks.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.058
What?
Every vendor there
knows her.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.694
"hel" this, "hel" that.
The hell part's right.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.295
It accounts for
her constant scheming.

39:59.297 --> 40:02.265
Always looking for
the next pair
of deep pockets

40:02.267 --> 40:04.000
To pay for her,
you know,

40:04.002 --> 40:06.836
Her sickness.
(sighs)

40:06.838 --> 40:10.273
Betty, al loves
the track.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.208
Al has deep pockets.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.811
Sounds like
a match made in heaven.

40:15.112 --> 40:16.446
Mmm.

40:18.482 --> 40:20.016
(sighs)

40:20.084 --> 40:20.717
(door closes)

40:20.719 --> 40:25.054
It's a high compliment
when patients of mine
refer their daughters.

40:25.056 --> 40:28.825
Although my mother
actually saw you
at memorial.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.661
The quality of care
will be no different here.

40:31.663 --> 40:36.533
Mrs. Johnson will
start by taking
a fertility history.

40:36.734 --> 40:37.967
It won't take long.

40:37.969 --> 40:40.069
(yelling in hallway)
then we'll do a brief

40:40.071 --> 40:43.840
Physical work-up,
we'll draw some blood.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.843
We can do that before
or after the physical exam,
whichever is...

40:46.845 --> 40:48.111
(yelling continues)
(loud clattering)

40:48.113 --> 40:50.079
Woman: Stop it!
Man: Say you're sorry!

40:50.081 --> 40:53.516
Could you excuse us
a moment?

40:53.518 --> 40:58.254
Man: Say you're sorry!
Apologize! Right now!
Apologize to her!

40:58.256 --> 40:59.823
Say sorry!
Woman: Hands off!

40:59.825 --> 41:00.857
Mr. Mccaffrey, please!

41:00.859 --> 41:02.459
He was looking
at my wife!

41:02.461 --> 41:03.059
Let him go!

41:03.061 --> 41:05.862
Virginia,
call the security guard.
Let him go now!

41:05.864 --> 41:08.131
Not before he apologizes
to my wife!

41:08.133 --> 41:11.034
For what? Being in
the same room with her?

41:11.036 --> 41:12.702
For sitting in a chair?

41:12.704 --> 41:14.037
You son of a bitch!

41:14.039 --> 41:15.738
Gentlemen,
that is enough!

41:15.740 --> 41:17.507
Maybe you need
some reminding whose

41:17.509 --> 41:18.942
Neighborhood
you wandered into.

41:18.944 --> 41:22.312
Oh, you can have
this barnyard, nigger.
Dr. Masters: Gentlemen!

41:22.314 --> 41:24.647
(women gasping)
(groans)

41:27.852 --> 41:33.790
As soon as I walked into
the waiting room,
I remembered him.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.692
Back at maternity,

41:35.694 --> 41:37.660
He was the husband
that wanted to be

41:37.662 --> 41:39.462
In the delivery room
with his wife.

41:39.464 --> 41:43.700
The same husband
who held her hand and wept

41:43.702 --> 41:46.002
When we handed him
his firstborn.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.338
And then today
at buell green,

41:48.340 --> 41:51.741
He was like
a neanderthal.

41:51.876 --> 41:53.376
There must be
something in the air,

41:53.378 --> 41:58.548
Because I, too,
had a similar
experience recently.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.817
What do you mean?

42:01.585 --> 42:03.152
A large colored man
banged on our door

42:03.154 --> 42:07.590
And told me
bluntly he didn't like
how I was treating coral.

42:07.592 --> 42:08.591
A large, colored...

42:08.593 --> 42:10.793
Coral's boyfriend,
as it turns out.

42:10.795 --> 42:12.962
He was coming here
to see her?

42:12.964 --> 42:15.131
No. Us. Me. Hmm.

42:15.133 --> 42:17.567
If he doesn't like coral
working for a living,

42:17.569 --> 42:20.103
He should take it up
with her, right?

42:20.105 --> 42:23.206
Not come here
and make threats.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.841
What, threats?

42:24.843 --> 42:26.676
What did he say, exactly?

42:26.678 --> 42:28.778
It's more how he said it.

42:28.780 --> 42:31.714
It's even possible
coral is lying about us.

42:31.716 --> 42:36.853
First of all, I didn't
force her head
under the faucet.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.724
So what did you do?

42:41.726 --> 42:42.825
I washed her hair.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.827
Because she refused
to do it herself.

42:44.829 --> 42:47.463
I told you the lice
were not coming from her.

42:47.465 --> 42:48.898
You said it was unlikely,
bill.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.134
And frankly,
you don't know everything.

42:51.136 --> 42:54.170
But did you
force her head?

42:54.172 --> 42:57.040
I didn't force anything.
That is not what happened.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.976
Why are you taking
her side in this?
And his?

42:59.978 --> 43:03.179
Why don't you take my side?
I stand up for you.

43:03.181 --> 43:05.048
I didn't
do anything wrong.

43:05.050 --> 43:08.885
Libby, you need
to apologize.

43:08.887 --> 43:10.486
If someone
did that to you?

43:10.488 --> 43:14.223
I wouldn't just stand
on their doorstep
in your defense.

43:14.225 --> 43:17.193
Their face would
look like mine,
I'd make damn sure.

43:17.195 --> 43:21.998
I think you got off lightly
with that young man.

43:28.172 --> 43:30.974
The casing we use
is made out of
bone and tendon.

43:30.976 --> 43:32.375
Some people use wood pulp.
But not us.

43:32.377 --> 43:35.812
I always thought
wood pulp was
the industry standard.

43:35.814 --> 43:38.114
Like a house on fire,
these two.

43:38.116 --> 43:39.949
Mmm. Can I have
more wine, please?

43:39.951 --> 43:40.750
Al: It's a family business.

43:40.752 --> 43:44.554
But funnily enough,
not my family.
I bought it.

43:44.556 --> 43:48.191
I love how passionate
you are about pepperoni.

43:48.692 --> 43:50.193
(chuckles)

43:50.195 --> 43:51.327
I also like dessert.

43:51.329 --> 43:54.964
And you smell just like
my mom's vanilla pudding.

43:54.966 --> 43:59.335
"well, I heard you're
a low-down yankee liar."

43:59.337 --> 44:00.937
(gene chuckles)

44:01.271 --> 44:03.473
Oh, that's good.
That's a good one.

44:03.475 --> 44:04.774
Men: Um...

44:04.776 --> 44:06.142
Jimmy stewart.
No.

44:06.144 --> 44:06.909
Gene: Gary cooper?

44:06.911 --> 44:09.379
No. Alan ladd.
Gene: Bingo.

44:09.381 --> 44:10.613
In  <i>shane.</i>

44:10.615 --> 44:11.481
Of course.

44:11.483 --> 44:12.982
Anyway,
the scent is cingerie.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.818
My mother always
wore it, now I do.

44:15.820 --> 44:22.859
A little on the wrists,
behind the ears,
a few drops in the bath.

44:22.861 --> 44:23.426
In the bath.

44:23.428 --> 44:26.596
Al: If we leave alan ladd
out of it,

44:26.598 --> 44:28.531
How 'bout I put
you in my pocket?

44:28.533 --> 44:31.701
I would like that,
but I bet I wouldn't fit.

44:31.703 --> 44:33.836
No. Helen, no betting.

44:33.838 --> 44:37.006
Al: No. Listen, with me,
it's not even gambling

44:37.008 --> 44:40.343
'cause I worked out
a very scientific system.

44:40.345 --> 44:41.344
And I'm happy to
show it to you.

44:41.346 --> 44:46.149
Maybe help you
minimize your losses
a little.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.685
Did betty tell you my secret?

44:48.687 --> 44:52.922
Yes. But I don't judge.
Not for a minute.

44:53.090 --> 44:54.824
Well, I suppose
I've spent a little

44:54.826 --> 44:56.726
Too much time
on the riverboats.

44:56.728 --> 45:00.763
Plus your afternoons
at the track.

45:01.131 --> 45:03.266
Yes. There's
the horses as well.

45:03.268 --> 45:05.435
Gene: Who doesn't, right?
(chuckling)

45:05.437 --> 45:06.502
Right.

45:06.504 --> 45:08.471
Did betty also tell you
about the time

45:08.473 --> 45:12.341
I heard there was a horse
running in the kentucky derby

45:12.343 --> 45:15.078
Named beautiful betty?
Aw...

45:15.080 --> 45:16.879
Odds were 13:1 against.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.649
I bet my last two bucks
on that horse.

45:19.651 --> 45:21.584
Gave the ticket to betty.

45:22.419 --> 45:26.289
She was feeling blue
about something.

45:26.291 --> 45:28.291
And I told her,

45:28.293 --> 45:30.760
"whenever you feel like
the world's against you,

45:30.762 --> 45:35.598
"look at that ticket
and know that no matter
what the odds are,

45:35.600 --> 45:38.434
"someone's betting on you."

45:41.605 --> 45:43.005
Huh.

45:43.540 --> 45:44.907
Isn't that nice?

45:44.909 --> 45:46.642
Yeah.

45:48.345 --> 45:50.213
Did the horse win?

45:50.215 --> 45:51.948
This story ends
in tragedy.

45:51.950 --> 45:54.250
The horse broke a leg.

45:54.252 --> 45:55.718
See, I can't hear that.

45:55.720 --> 45:57.386
It is true.

45:57.388 --> 45:58.788
Hmm.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.223
They had to shoot her.

46:00.225 --> 46:02.191
(gene sighs in disappointment)

46:02.193 --> 46:04.060
(laughing)

46:05.295 --> 46:06.896
It does happen.

46:06.898 --> 46:08.831
(women laughing)

46:10.134 --> 46:11.667
I'll say.

46:11.669 --> 46:14.137
(both continue laughing)

46:15.372 --> 46:17.473
(laughs awkwardly)

46:19.143 --> 46:21.277
(laughing continues)

46:21.979 --> 46:25.114
I guess you know
how to pick 'em.

46:25.616 --> 46:27.617
I'm sorry.

46:28.385 --> 46:31.721
This is where my system
could come in handy.

46:31.723 --> 46:33.723
(women continue laughing)

46:39.630 --> 46:40.830
(coughing) um...

46:40.832 --> 46:43.699
I need to powder.

46:43.801 --> 46:45.868
Gene: Oh, that's rich.

46:54.244 --> 46:55.978
(betty sighs)

47:08.392 --> 47:10.760
You can't do that.

47:10.762 --> 47:12.695
I just did.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.531
(door opens)
(gasps)

47:52.236 --> 47:55.271
After the dust-up yesterday,
I thought it'd be best

47:55.273 --> 47:56.906
If we kept our
patients separate.

47:56.908 --> 48:01.277
Unless you're
going for stitches
next time, doctor.

48:03.614 --> 48:07.183
I don't think
this is the right
solution.

48:07.185 --> 48:09.852
Good morning, obstetrics.

48:09.854 --> 48:10.653
Mrs. Johnson?

48:10.655 --> 48:14.090
It seems someone's
trying to track you down.

48:18.829 --> 48:20.463
Hello?

48:32.876 --> 48:34.377
Lillian,
what happened?

48:34.379 --> 48:35.478
They must've
said on the phone.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.247
They didn't.
They just said
some kind of accident.

48:38.249 --> 48:41.117
Some 10-year-old
wandered into
the ladies' room

48:41.119 --> 48:44.020
And found me passed out.
On the floor.

48:44.022 --> 48:45.421
Was it a seizure?

48:45.423 --> 48:46.555
How would I know?

48:46.557 --> 48:49.358
One minute, I'm trying to
thread my typewriter ribbon.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.595
Next I'm on the floor
with a kid screaming over me.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.330
She thought I was dead.

48:54.865 --> 48:57.667
They would only release me
to a responsible party.

48:57.669 --> 49:00.202
I didn't know
who else to call.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.121
Lillian,
let's get you inside.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.757
No. Just...

49:21.759 --> 49:24.160
Can we sit?

49:25.762 --> 49:27.496
Okay.

49:32.002 --> 49:35.805
I'm never going back
to that hospital.

49:35.807 --> 49:41.043
As a patient, maybe.
But never again as a doctor.

49:41.045 --> 49:42.979
I'm done there.

49:43.413 --> 49:44.580
They said that?

49:44.582 --> 49:46.615
I don't want to wait
for them to tell me.

49:46.617 --> 49:51.954
It'd be irresponsible
to stay on. Something
different every day.

49:51.956 --> 49:54.490
A garbled word.
A forgotten diagnosis.

49:54.492 --> 49:56.192
Ten minutes
I can't account for.

49:56.194 --> 49:58.995
You have good stretches.

49:59.563 --> 50:01.330
You were very articulate
the other day

50:01.332 --> 50:05.401
When you were
expressing your extreme
disappointment in me.

50:05.403 --> 50:07.470
Was I?

50:07.637 --> 50:09.839
Did I apologize?

50:12.409 --> 50:14.110
Good.

50:18.582 --> 50:20.316
(chuckles)

50:24.488 --> 50:28.290
I am scared, though,
for what's ahead.

50:30.961 --> 50:33.095
Which means I can't

50:33.097 --> 50:37.333
Really afford to
be upset with you.
Now can I?

51:14.104 --> 51:17.139
I'd like to
speak to you.

51:22.312 --> 51:23.679
Yes, ma'am?

51:23.681 --> 51:26.082
I know when you came to
my door the other day,

51:26.084 --> 51:28.250
You did it out of
concern for coral.

51:28.252 --> 51:31.153
And not necessarily
as a threat to me.

51:31.155 --> 51:34.256
So I've thought
about it, and yes,

51:34.357 --> 51:37.927
I may have overreacted
when I washed coral's hair.

51:38.728 --> 51:39.829
I just had a baby.

51:39.831 --> 51:40.963
And when
you have a baby,

51:40.965 --> 51:43.666
Even minor incidents
can seem major.

51:43.668 --> 51:44.567
It's in all the books.

51:44.569 --> 51:49.338
My point is,
I shouldn't have done
that to coral. I'm sorry.

51:53.510 --> 51:54.376
Common courtesy dictates

51:54.378 --> 51:59.014
That you get out of
the car and accept
my apology properly.

51:59.182 --> 52:04.220
I think
the person you ought to be
apologizing to is coral.

52:04.488 --> 52:06.322
Coral is
a different matter.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.158
Coral deliberately
disobeyed me.

52:10.494 --> 52:11.861
Pay attention now, coral.

52:11.863 --> 52:13.929
'cause this here
is a good lesson

52:13.931 --> 52:15.831
In white people's
inability to take

52:15.833 --> 52:17.967
Responsibility
for their actions

52:17.969 --> 52:19.135
And do the right thing.

52:19.137 --> 52:20.870
Did you say
"white people"?

52:20.872 --> 52:23.439
Get in, coral.
We're leaving.

52:23.573 --> 52:25.741
(car engine starting)

52:26.076 --> 52:27.943
(car door closing)

52:31.882 --> 52:37.319
You should know, my husband
works in the negro hospital.

52:41.892 --> 52:44.894
See dr. Mcalpin
down in ophthalmology.

52:44.896 --> 52:45.794
He's the best
in the city

52:45.796 --> 52:49.932
And can make sure
there's been no damage
to your vision.

52:49.934 --> 52:53.369
Clearly, my vision was
impaired to begin with,

52:53.371 --> 52:55.004
Not to see
this coming.

52:55.006 --> 52:55.905
I fear I may
have misjudged

52:55.907 --> 53:01.710
How my patients would
handle the transition
to a new hospital.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.779
We were as surprised as you
by the fighting.

53:03.781 --> 53:07.283
Dr. Masters: The truth is
our patients are reluctant
to come here.

53:07.285 --> 53:11.320
Some have had issues
with the neighborhood.

53:11.322 --> 53:14.757
Others have misgivings
about the mix of patients.

53:14.759 --> 53:17.493
It seems inevitable
we're going to lose a few.

53:17.495 --> 53:20.229
Inevitable? You're
just resigned to that?

53:20.231 --> 53:22.131
It doesn't mean
they won't return in time.

53:22.133 --> 53:24.366
But it may take them
becoming unhappy

53:24.368 --> 53:26.235
With the care
someone else provides

53:26.237 --> 53:28.204
Before they come
back to me.

53:28.206 --> 53:29.738
And you're prepared
to wait it out?

53:29.740 --> 53:32.575
Meanwhile, we can serve
the patients already here.

53:32.577 --> 53:34.376
And we have
the study to focus on.

53:34.378 --> 53:39.782
As long as we can keep
your delivery men away
from our fliers.

53:39.784 --> 53:44.220
I have to say,
I'm disappointed.

53:50.193 --> 53:52.428
I'm not sure
what the alternative is.

53:52.430 --> 53:55.264
Dr. Hendricks: You ever
watch how people get
into a cold lake?

53:55.266 --> 53:59.668
There are the ones that go
very slowly, inch by inch.

53:59.670 --> 54:02.905
Even rise up on
their tiptoes to
stave off the cold.

54:02.907 --> 54:05.374
Then there are those
who take the plunge,

54:05.376 --> 54:06.141
Get it over with,

54:06.143 --> 54:10.179
Trust they'll
adjust to the cold
once it's enveloped them.

54:10.181 --> 54:13.616
If I had time to slowly
change people's minds
about segregation,

54:13.618 --> 54:17.453
I would've brought in
some young, unassuming
white resident,

54:17.455 --> 54:18.854
Let patients
slowly get used to him.

54:18.856 --> 54:21.824
And then I would've hired
another one, and another.

54:21.826 --> 54:24.393
But there's too much
I want to accomplish

54:24.395 --> 54:25.794
To take my time doing it.

54:25.796 --> 54:27.096
Which is why I hired you.

54:27.098 --> 54:29.865
You with your
dedicated exam room.

54:29.867 --> 54:34.803
With your essential
assistant, your sex study.

54:34.805 --> 54:38.707
You were the cold lake,
and I jumped in
with both feet.

54:38.709 --> 54:39.275
Thank you.

54:39.277 --> 54:40.743
Dr. Hendricks: I knew
exactly what I was getting.

54:40.745 --> 54:42.511
A man who showed
a room full of doctors

54:42.513 --> 54:45.114
What the inside of a woman
climaxing looked like,

54:45.116 --> 54:47.283
And had his hat
handed to him for it.

54:47.285 --> 54:49.818
You didn't ease people
out of ignorance,

54:49.820 --> 54:51.553
You exposed them
to the truth.

54:51.555 --> 54:55.824
You said this is going
to be uncomfortable,
but it's important.

54:55.826 --> 54:59.028
And it's going to
open your eyes forever.

54:59.030 --> 55:02.197
You and I,
we don't look the same.

55:02.199 --> 55:03.732
But we are the same.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.834
We are not
men who wait.

55:05.836 --> 55:07.503
You need to make
a case for yourself.

55:07.505 --> 55:09.605
You need to call
every patient you ever had

55:09.607 --> 55:11.907
And say this is where
you need to be, with me.

55:11.909 --> 55:14.176
That's how you move
your practice forward,

55:14.178 --> 55:15.844
How I move
my hospital forward,

55:15.846 --> 55:19.248
How we move
history forward.

55:19.250 --> 55:21.684
I'm afraid history
is outside my purview.

55:21.686 --> 55:23.585
You know
that's not true.

55:23.587 --> 55:25.721
You wouldn't be
doing this study

55:25.723 --> 55:28.590
Of yours
if that were the case.

55:33.330 --> 55:34.229
Last year,

55:34.231 --> 55:37.966
Martin luther king, jr.
Stood less than a mile
from here and said,

55:37.968 --> 55:40.536
"st. Louis is a city
that's moving forward,

55:40.538 --> 55:45.507
"embracing its future,
not standing in its way."

55:45.509 --> 55:49.912
This hospital
will be integrated.
Now,

55:50.080 --> 55:53.048
Are you willing
to help me do that?

55:54.317 --> 55:58.153
We each choose
our battles, charles.

55:58.155 --> 56:02.591
And wooing patients
is not my gift.

56:02.593 --> 56:03.525
Come on, bill.

56:03.527 --> 56:06.462
It's really
more virginia's.

56:07.964 --> 56:10.065
Well, then, mrs. Johnson,

56:10.067 --> 56:13.335
You have your work
cut out for you.

56:13.470 --> 56:15.771
I suppose I do.

56:15.939 --> 56:17.373
Hmm.

56:31.955 --> 56:34.289
Did you say that
just to appease him?

56:34.291 --> 56:38.961
About you? I said it
because it's true.

56:39.329 --> 56:41.430
There are things that

56:41.432 --> 56:45.868
You are better at than I.

56:45.870 --> 56:49.638
Just as there are things
I'm better at, of course.

56:50.106 --> 56:52.508
Of course.

56:52.776 --> 56:54.676
At this rate,
I expect to see you

56:54.678 --> 56:56.879
In the front row
at dr. King's next rally.

56:56.881 --> 56:59.481
Be serious, virginia.
That's not my fight.

56:59.483 --> 57:04.386
But if in helping ourselves,
we also help dr. Hendricks,

57:04.388 --> 57:07.022
I see nothing
wrong with that.
