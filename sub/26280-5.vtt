WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.830
Recently, 12 new moons

00:04.874 --> 00:06.354
were discovered
orbiting Jupiter,

00:06.397 --> 00:09.444
bringing the total up to 79.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.837
As a middle child myself,
I'd like to extend

00:11.881 --> 00:14.971
my sympathies to moons
two through 78.

00:17.060 --> 00:18.975
Your grandpa
will never learn your name.

00:21.108 --> 00:23.893
I'd like to thank you for
joining me on this journey

00:23.936 --> 00:26.113
[laughs]through the stars.

00:26.156 --> 00:27.549
If you enjoyed
this lecture,

00:27.592 --> 00:32.554
please come back Thursday
for the exact same one.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.995
Do I look like I just woke up?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.823
No.
Great. I'm gonna
go say hey to Raj.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.174
What were you guys
giggling about?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.828
They were passing
notes to each other.

00:45.871 --> 00:48.178
Oh-ho, love notes?

00:48.222 --> 00:49.353
If you love math.

00:50.485 --> 00:52.878
And we do.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.619
It's for our
super-asymmetry theory.

00:54.663 --> 00:55.968
Yeah, Amy and I have
been having so much fun

00:56.012 --> 00:57.796
collaborating together.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.233
Well, you know what they
say, you never collaborate

00:59.276 --> 01:02.453
as much as your first
year of marriage.

01:02.497 --> 01:04.673
Hey, great show.
Thanks.

01:04.716 --> 01:06.240
Oh, Howard, uh,
this is Andrea.

01:06.283 --> 01:08.155
She's the director
of the planetarium.Hi.

01:08.198 --> 01:10.026
Nice to meet you.
I'm Howard Wolowitz.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.636
Engineer, husband, father...

01:11.680 --> 01:13.029
[chuckles]
...astronaut.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.292
Really? You're an astronaut?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.033
Well, I don't like to brag.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.426
Hmm, yeah, but
somehow, you manage.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.691
Raj, you should have Howard
join you for one of your shows.

01:22.734 --> 01:24.736
Oh, that might be fun.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.303
But-- it might be, but with
two small children at home

01:26.347 --> 01:28.784
and a full-time job,
I'm sure you're too busy.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.394
No, I could find the time.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.700
Well, you don't have
to decide right now.It's okay, I...

01:31.743 --> 01:33.571
He can't do it.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.573
Hey, hurry up, guys.

01:35.617 --> 01:36.966
The gift shop's closing,
and Amy said

01:37.009 --> 01:38.359
I can get one big thing
or two little things.

01:40.883 --> 01:44.582
♪ Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state ♪

01:44.626 --> 01:47.716
♪ Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! ♪

01:47.759 --> 01:49.544
♪ The Earth began to cool

01:49.587 --> 01:52.155
♪ The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools ♪

01:52.199 --> 01:54.549
♪ We built the Wall ♪ We built the pyramids♪

01:54.592 --> 01:57.421
♪ Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery ♪

01:57.465 --> 01:59.075
♪ That all started
with a big bang ♪

01:59.119 --> 02:00.555
♪ Bang!♪

02:08.389 --> 02:10.391
So I'm gonna place the sensory
isolation helmet on you

02:10.434 --> 02:11.870
for about five minutes.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.176
All you need to do

02:13.220 --> 02:14.743
is sit still and relax.

02:14.786 --> 02:16.962
What do I do if I start
to get claustrophobic?

02:17.006 --> 02:20.009
Oh, the helmet will sense that
and stop the experiment.

02:20.052 --> 02:21.750
Really?
No, but that would
be cool, wouldn't it?

02:25.319 --> 02:26.798
Amy, are you busy?

02:26.842 --> 02:29.279
I've got a subject wired up
for a sensory study.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.238
So...

02:31.281 --> 02:33.501
Yes, I'm busy.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.980
Oh.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.330
I'm tracking a subject's
brain activity

02:36.373 --> 02:38.767
in real time as we
introduce olfactory stimuli.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.943
I'm smelling baby powder.

02:40.986 --> 02:44.512
That's just my husband.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.167
Well, I had a thought about
our super-asymmetry theory.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.777
Let me show you this one thing.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.213
Well, I-I want to see it,

02:50.257 --> 02:51.649
but not when I'm in the middle
of an experiment.

02:51.693 --> 02:54.870
Still baby powder!

02:54.913 --> 02:57.916
Boy, he is annoying. Do any
of those buttons shock him?

02:57.960 --> 03:02.007
Look, I'm really excited
about our paper, too,

03:02.051 --> 03:03.531
but I've got
a lot of my own work

03:03.574 --> 03:04.967
to catch up on,
so let's talk later.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.926
Okay, I'll just say one
more thing: lambda calculus.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.885
And if that wets your whistle,
you know where to find me.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.104
Boop.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.199
You okay? You seem distracted.

03:19.242 --> 03:22.419
I'm-I'm just thinking about Raj.

03:22.463 --> 03:23.899
I'm thinking about
Chris Hemsworth. Let's go.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.774
He sort of hurt my feelings.

03:29.818 --> 03:33.343
[quietly]: Biceps, hammer, abs.
Still in it.

03:33.387 --> 03:36.912
Why wouldn't he want me to be
in his planetarium show?

03:36.955 --> 03:39.306
And it's gone.

03:39.349 --> 03:41.743
Sorry, it's just the director
of the planetarium thought

03:41.786 --> 03:43.919
it'd be fun for me to join Raj
for one of his shows,

03:43.962 --> 03:46.530
and he made it clear
that he didn't want me to.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.358
Of course he wouldn't
want you to.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.968
I mean, think about it.
If you were him,

03:50.012 --> 03:53.798
would you want to share the
stage with a sexy-ass astronaut?

03:53.842 --> 03:56.279
I don't know.
How sexy are we talking?

03:56.323 --> 04:01.284
Oh, you know, tight pants,
huge biceps, magic hammer.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.026
Wait, w-who are we talk...Shh, I'm back in it.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.290
SHELDON: [stammers]
The fundamental problem

04:07.334 --> 04:09.466
with elementary quantum
mechanical formalism

04:09.510 --> 04:11.076
is that the Fourier transform

04:11.120 --> 04:13.644
extends to minus infinity
in time.

04:13.688 --> 04:16.256
Hey, don't dumb this down
for me.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.694
Penny, I'm...

04:19.737 --> 04:20.825
Late for that thing. See you.

04:20.869 --> 04:21.652
Leonard!

04:21.696 --> 04:23.959
Oh, Sheldon.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.352
Didn't see you there. What's up?

04:25.395 --> 04:27.571
Well, uh, he was
excited to talk science

04:27.615 --> 04:29.051
with Amy,
but she was working late,

04:29.094 --> 04:31.183
so he decided to come over
and share it with me.

04:31.227 --> 04:34.317
With me, Leonard.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.319
With me.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.366
Sheldon,
we've talked about this.

04:39.409 --> 04:42.151
You can't go around
boring other people's wives.

04:42.194 --> 04:43.283
PENNY:
Yeah.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.981
I already got a man for that.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.679
Yeah, you do.
Yeah.

04:48.723 --> 04:49.854
It's just, I've
just been enjoying

04:49.898 --> 04:51.378
my collaboration with Amy,

04:51.421 --> 04:52.814
but ever since we got back
from our honeymoon,

04:52.857 --> 04:54.468
she has so little time.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.817
Well, she does have her own job.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.688
Yeah, but it's so dull.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.864
Trying to understand
how the brain

04:59.908 --> 05:03.912
translates the five senses
into biochemical information.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.828
I'd rather wait in line
without my phone.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.005
Okay, well, Leonard's here now.
You can talk science with him.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.398
Where you going?

05:11.441 --> 05:12.790
Oh, that thing
you were late for.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.619
One of us should
really be there.

05:17.186 --> 05:19.536
Hey. Got a sec?

05:19.580 --> 05:20.581
Sure. What's up?

05:20.624 --> 05:23.061
I just want to let
you know I get

05:23.105 --> 05:25.716
why you don't want me to be
a part of the planetarium show.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.937
Oh, great.
Thanks for stopping by.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.591
You don't want to talk
about the stars

05:30.634 --> 05:32.854
next to an actual astronaut.

05:32.897 --> 05:35.726
That would be like doing karaoke
with a rock star.

05:35.770 --> 05:40.514
First of all, I've totally done
karaoke with a rock star.

05:40.557 --> 05:42.254
Or are you forgetting
when the Spin Doctors

05:42.298 --> 05:45.040
handed me the mic
at the Orange County Fair?

05:45.083 --> 05:48.173
Listen, I understand
you being intimidated,

05:48.217 --> 05:50.785
but I can't help that I'm proud
of being an astronaut.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.221
It's a big deal.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.397
Oh, it certainly is,
but I also happen to be

05:54.441 --> 05:56.704
very accomplished in my field.

05:56.747 --> 05:58.358
Great. So you have no reason

05:58.401 --> 06:00.751
to be scared
of sharing the spotlight.

06:00.795 --> 06:04.364
Please. I may be scared
of heights and spiders

06:04.407 --> 06:05.887
and showing up
at a costume party

06:05.930 --> 06:07.715
that turns out
to be a regular party,

06:07.758 --> 06:11.632
but I am not scared of sharing
the spotlight with you!

06:18.595 --> 06:20.380
What's happening?

06:20.423 --> 06:22.382
I just stormed out
for dramatic effect.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.210
I... Actually, I-I don't have
anywhere to go.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.825
President Siebert, how much
do you know about physics?

06:30.868 --> 06:32.304
I'm a physicist.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.657
Huh. I would not
have guessed that.

06:38.354 --> 06:39.877
I have a doctorate
from Indiana University.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.096
Oh, that makes more sense.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.837
Well, don't worry, I'll go slow.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.100
Thank you.

06:45.143 --> 06:48.233
Dr. Fowler and I have
been working on

06:48.277 --> 06:50.235
a theory of super-asymmetry

06:50.279 --> 06:53.369
that could reconcile the lack
of observation of supersymmetry

06:53.413 --> 06:55.110
in a world still governed
by string theory.

06:55.153 --> 06:59.462
Interesting. So you're taking
the paradigms of supersymmetry,

06:59.506 --> 07:03.466
but removing the limitations
of obeying the Poincaré algebra.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.468
Well, aren't you just
the pride of Bloomington?

07:05.512 --> 07:07.992
What do you want, Sheldon?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.690
Dr. Fowler has
found herself distracted

07:09.733 --> 07:11.692
by the commitments
in her own lab.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.476
It would be a great help
to both of us

07:13.520 --> 07:16.000
if you could free her up
from her other projects.

07:16.044 --> 07:19.221
I'm confused.Yeah, well, there's
that Indiana.

07:19.264 --> 07:22.137
This is physics research.
Dr. Fowler's a neuroscientist.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.530
Y-Yes,

07:23.573 --> 07:25.270
but her insights
into the very ways

07:25.314 --> 07:28.360
we conceptualize symmetry and
asymmetry have been invaluable.

07:28.404 --> 07:29.884
Dr. Cooper...L-Look, I know

07:29.927 --> 07:31.363
what you're thinking,
that "they're newlyweds,

07:31.407 --> 07:33.235
how are they gonna keep
their hands off of each other?"

07:33.278 --> 07:36.543
Let me assure you, we will not
engage in workplace coitus.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.502
Okay, if I won't
put a bagel on my desk,

07:39.546 --> 07:42.679
I'm certainly not putting
Amy's bare bottom.

07:42.723 --> 07:46.683
I-I must say,
I do not enjoy our talks.

07:51.514 --> 07:54.386
Dr. Park, may I help you?

07:54.430 --> 07:56.345
Actually, yes, do you have any
better notes on this project?

07:56.388 --> 07:58.478
I'm having a hard time
reading your handwriting.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.088
Oh, uh, allow me
to rephrase that.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.569
What the hell
are you doing in my lab?

08:02.612 --> 08:05.963
I'm sorry, I was reassigned
to this project.

08:06.007 --> 08:07.008
I was told you were taking

08:07.051 --> 08:08.009
a temporary sabbatical

08:08.052 --> 08:09.097
to focus on other work.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.012
N-No, that-that's crazy.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
This is my research.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.799
Oh, Amy, there you are.No, not...

08:15.843 --> 08:18.889
Not now, Sheldon, I'm dealing
with an epic screwup,

08:18.933 --> 08:19.760
and when I find out
who's responsible,

08:19.803 --> 08:21.109
they're gonna get an earful.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.502
All right, well,
when you're done, let me know,

08:22.545 --> 08:23.938
I've got some exciting news.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.766
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
President Siebert said

08:25.809 --> 08:27.811
you were focusing on
some important physics work

08:27.855 --> 08:30.031
and I should take over
your lab in the interim.

08:30.074 --> 08:31.815
Uh, hey, that was
my exciting news.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.514
All right, I'm gonna
tell you again.

08:34.557 --> 08:35.384
Pretend you haven't heard it.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.958
You got me removed
from my own project?

08:44.001 --> 08:45.263
Yeah, and it wasn't easy.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.091
Apparently, you're very
difficult to replace.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.311
Hey, just between you and me,

08:49.354 --> 08:52.444
they consider Dr. Park
quite the step down.

08:55.796 --> 08:59.277
I was trying to pick my moment
to leave. This seems like it.

08:59.321 --> 09:02.498
Wow. Banker's hours.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.370
No wonder you're not
on the tenure track.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.895
Sheldon, you had no right.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.636
What-- I thought you said
you were spread too thin.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.072
You said that you wished
you had more time to focus

09:11.115 --> 09:13.204
on our research.
I thought I was helping.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.379
Well, you're not.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.904
I mean, I have years
invested in this work,

09:16.947 --> 09:19.559
and now someone's gonna
come in and take it over?

09:19.602 --> 09:21.473
I mean, how would you feel
if I let Leonard take over

09:21.517 --> 09:22.953
your super-asymmetry project?

09:22.997 --> 09:24.215
[laughs]
That's funny.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.959
Oh, he'd be like a puppy
with a microscope. [laughs]

09:30.526 --> 09:32.223
[chuckles]

09:32.267 --> 09:36.576
If I had a nickel for every time
a charity sent me a nickel.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.624
Really? That's gonna be
our whole life, huh?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.497
If my father's any guide,
around 50,

09:45.541 --> 09:48.065
I start to lose my hearing
and get two new jokes.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.066
[knock on door]

09:49.110 --> 09:51.721
Hey.
Hey.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.375
I brought Chinese.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.682
Oh, that's a nice surprise.
What's the occasion?

09:55.725 --> 09:58.380
Please, I don't need a reason
to bring food to my friends.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.860
But you have one, don't you?

09:59.903 --> 10:01.644
Yeah, I need your help.

10:01.688 --> 10:03.820
All right, lay it on us.

10:03.864 --> 10:06.257
So, I folded,

10:06.301 --> 10:07.737
and I told Howard
he could be a part

10:07.781 --> 10:09.434
of my planetarium show.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.653
And now I'm worried
he's just gonna

10:10.697 --> 10:12.612
make the whole thing
about himself.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.048
So just tell him
you changed your mind

10:14.091 --> 10:15.527
and you don't
want him to do it.

10:15.571 --> 10:16.877
No, no, then he's gonna think
I'm too insecure

10:16.920 --> 10:17.834
to share the spotlight with him.

10:17.878 --> 10:19.531
And he'd be right.

10:19.575 --> 10:21.664
I came here
for your support.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.187
Well, then, you just walked up

10:23.231 --> 10:24.580
three flights of stairs
for nothing.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.887
Wait, don't you mean
four flights?

10:26.930 --> 10:28.323
No, it's actually three.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.455
But we're on the fourth floor.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.848
I mean, you have the lobby,
first floor,

10:31.892 --> 10:32.936
second, third, fourth.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.372
The lobby's the first floor,

10:34.416 --> 10:35.765
so lobby, second, third, fourth.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.506
That does not seem right.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.813
Hello...

10:39.856 --> 10:43.077
Sorry, Raj, who cares if
Howard tries to steal the show?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.382
All right? You're great
at what you do.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.123
Just be the bigger man.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.690
And if it makes you feel better,
Penny and I will come

10:47.734 --> 10:49.431
so you'll have a couple of
friendly faces in the audience.

10:49.474 --> 10:50.998
Thank you.
That would be nice.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.521
Can you just...
Sorry, give me a minute?

11:00.877 --> 11:03.271
Hey, Raj, if I had a nickel
for every time

11:03.314 --> 11:05.316
a charity sent me a nickel...

11:07.014 --> 11:08.624
That's hilarious!

11:08.668 --> 11:09.843
I know.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.718
[exhales]

11:15.762 --> 11:16.850
It's three, right?

11:16.893 --> 11:19.635
Just shut up.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.856
Oh, good,
we caught you.

11:22.899 --> 11:25.510
Yes, good.

11:25.554 --> 11:27.948
You had no right
to reassign my project.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.253
Yeah, no right at all.

11:29.297 --> 11:30.733
Dr. Fowler,
I don't understand.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.735
Dr. Cooper assured me
this is what you wanted.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.563
Oh-oh! Can you
believe this guy?

11:34.606 --> 11:35.956
Oh, sure,

11:35.999 --> 11:38.393
so a couple of men get together
behind closed doors

11:38.436 --> 11:40.221
to decide the fate
of a woman's career.

11:40.264 --> 11:41.439
I thought we'd
moved past this.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.094
Sheldon, this is
your fault.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.574
Ooh, sounds like
the old lady's

11:45.617 --> 11:46.880
putting me in the
doghouse tonight.

11:46.923 --> 11:49.012
Dr. Fowler,

11:49.056 --> 11:50.492
you are very important
to this university

11:50.535 --> 11:52.624
and I would like
to sincerely apologize.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.757
So I can have
my project back?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.367
I'm afraid it's
not that simple.
Why not?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.456
Well, in order
to free up personnel...

11:58.500 --> 12:01.851
Hey, hey, don't go
mansplaining things to her.

12:01.895 --> 12:03.940
I don't think that's
what he was doing.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.507
Oh, then perhaps
you don't understand.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.291
See, mansplaining is when
a man explains things

12:07.335 --> 12:08.466
to a woman like
she's stupid.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.167
Boop.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.648
So when was the last time

12:16.692 --> 12:18.781
you saw Howard in his
astronaut uniform?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.783
About a week ago.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.045
Really? What was
the occasion?

12:22.089 --> 12:23.568
Date night.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.441
We do a little role-playing.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.443
What role
do you play?

12:28.486 --> 12:32.534
[Russian accent]:
I am Ykatarina Nazdorovya,

12:32.577 --> 12:35.232
lonely Russian cosmonaut
who is expert at physics

12:35.276 --> 12:37.191
and making love.

12:39.410 --> 12:43.023
Okay, that just made
the next hour really weird.

12:45.677 --> 12:48.506
Good evening,
I am Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

12:48.550 --> 12:51.422
and usually I take you on a trip
through the stars,

12:51.466 --> 12:53.381
but tonight,
we'll begin our journey

12:53.424 --> 12:56.558
much closer to home, 220 miles

12:56.601 --> 12:59.648
straight up to
the International Space Station,

12:59.691 --> 13:03.043
which is manned by a team
of brave men and women.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.219
[Russian accent]:
Flexible men and women.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.264
Switch with me.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.006
KOOTHRAPPALI:
And we are fortunate

13:10.050 --> 13:13.444
to have one of those men
here with us tonight.

13:13.488 --> 13:16.056
Please welcome to
the Griffith Observatory

13:16.099 --> 13:18.101
astronaut Howard Joel Wolowitz.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.846
Kak horosho.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.982
What is she ta...Don't ask.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.985
Thank you, Raj, that was
a really nice introduction.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.377
Well, it's from my heart.

13:33.421 --> 13:37.251
So, Howard, you are
in an elite group.

13:37.294 --> 13:40.645
Only 232 people
have ever been on

13:40.689 --> 13:42.996
the International Space
Station. How does that

13:43.039 --> 13:44.519
make you feel?

13:44.562 --> 13:47.174
Honestly, lucky.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.263
Most astronauts have to
train their whole lives.

13:49.306 --> 13:52.222
I was just in the right
place at the right time.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.703
Oh, please, luck had
nothing to do with it.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.097
You people need to know
how impressive

13:57.140 --> 13:59.142
this man is.
He was up there

13:59.186 --> 14:01.841
because he's the
only one qualified

14:01.884 --> 14:04.365
to install a piece of
equipment that he designed.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.671
Thanks, but if you want
to talk impressive,

14:06.715 --> 14:08.630
this guy right here
discovered a planetary object

14:08.673 --> 14:10.023
outside the
Kuiper belt.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.763
He worked on
the Mars rover.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.722
He helped launch the
New Horizons space probe.

14:13.765 --> 14:17.421
He went to space
on a Russian rocket.

14:17.465 --> 14:19.728
And I was scared
the whole time.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.645
And I was scared for you,
but also proud.

14:23.688 --> 14:27.388
Wow.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.564
I don't think you've ever
said that to me before.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.435
I should have,

14:31.479 --> 14:33.960
and I'm gonna
say it again.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.483
I'm proud of you.

14:35.526 --> 14:38.181
You're my best friend,
and I love you.

14:38.225 --> 14:41.619
Aw, Raj,
I love you, too.

14:41.663 --> 14:45.145
What is happening?

14:45.188 --> 14:49.497
Bring it in, spaceman,
you've been cleared for landing.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.764
Can you believe these two...
Are you crying?
[crying]

15:08.168 --> 15:10.605
Hello, Sheldon.

15:10.648 --> 15:12.259
Hello, Arthur.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.956
Now, I'm confused, usually when
you appear to me in my dreams,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.697
we're on the planet Dagobah.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.481
This is Dagobah.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.401
I didn't know that Dagobah
had delicatessens.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.795
Not good ones.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.754
Whatever you do,

15:29.798 --> 15:32.801
don't order the Reuben.

15:32.844 --> 15:36.065
I'm having a problem
in my marriage.

15:36.109 --> 15:39.677
I've upset my wife and I don't
know how to make it right.

15:39.721 --> 15:43.464
[chuckles] And you're... and
you're coming to me for advice?

15:43.507 --> 15:47.859
I-I upset my wife every time
I woke up in the morning.

15:47.903 --> 15:50.645
I'm not coming to you,

15:50.688 --> 15:53.169
you're just a manifestation
of my subconscious.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.866
I mean,
I'm actually coming to me.

15:54.910 --> 15:58.392
So you know everything
I'm going to say.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.959
Yes, but it sounds
wiser from you

16:00.002 --> 16:02.309
because you're old and glowing.

16:02.352 --> 16:03.440
Fine.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.834
Rule number one
in a marriage:

16:05.877 --> 16:07.662
don't go to bed angry.

16:07.705 --> 16:10.317
That makes sense.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.059
Rule number two in a marriage:

16:13.102 --> 16:16.540
if you don't recognize
the shoes under your bed,

16:16.584 --> 16:18.847
they're not your shoes.

16:18.890 --> 16:22.459
Because they're her shoes?

16:22.503 --> 16:24.505
[sighs] N-Never mind,

16:24.548 --> 16:27.551
just-just go with
rule number one.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.901
Thank you, Arthur.

16:29.945 --> 16:32.687
Uh, before you go,
can I ask you a question?

16:32.730 --> 16:33.862
Of course.

16:33.905 --> 16:36.778
Does this look lean to you?

16:37.866 --> 16:40.651
I ordered lean.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.003
Amy. Wake up. Amy.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.395
What? What's wrong?

16:45.439 --> 16:47.223
We can't go to sleep
angry with each other.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.311
Why not?

16:48.355 --> 16:50.052
It's rule number one.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.315
I'd tell you rule number two,
but it's confusing.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.578
Sheldon,
go to sleep.

16:54.622 --> 16:58.713
Amy. Amy. Amy.

16:58.756 --> 17:01.542
You cut that out!

17:01.585 --> 17:03.413
Oh, good, you're up.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.981
Sheldon...

17:06.025 --> 17:08.244
I just really don't want to talk
to you about this right now.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.245
That's fine.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.551
I just need
you to know

17:10.594 --> 17:12.553
that I feel terrible
about what I did

17:12.596 --> 17:14.424
and I wasn't
being malicious.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.731
No, you were being selfish.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.124
You're being selfish right now

17:18.167 --> 17:20.256
'cause it's really late
and I just want to sleep.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.432
No, Professor Proton
came to me in my dream

17:22.476 --> 17:24.217
and said we can't
go to sleep angry.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.914
Are you sure
that's what he said?

17:25.957 --> 17:26.958
Close your eyes,
double-check.

17:27.002 --> 17:31.702
Amy, this is
important.

17:31.746 --> 17:36.185
Okay, listen to me.

17:36.229 --> 17:40.059
I love working with you,

17:40.102 --> 17:42.974
but you have to understand
how scary this is for me.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.846
Why?

17:44.889 --> 17:49.459
Because I don't want to get lost
in this relationship.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.679
And when you pulled me
off my project,

17:51.722 --> 17:54.377
it seemed like my biggest
fear was coming true,

17:54.421 --> 17:57.641
the-the things that are mine
are getting subsumed

17:57.685 --> 17:59.687
into the things
that are ours.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.342
I wouldn't want that
to happen, either.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.909
Thank you for explaining

18:04.953 --> 18:06.389
and for using
the word "subsume,"

18:06.433 --> 18:07.825
that's one you
don't hear enough.

18:07.869 --> 18:11.307
You're welcome.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.092
Good night.
Good night.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.402
What are you
doing now?

18:19.446 --> 18:21.491
Looking for shoes.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.145
Why?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.104
When your favorite ghost tells
you to do something, you do it.
