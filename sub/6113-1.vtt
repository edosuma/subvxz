WEBVTT

00:26.993 --> 00:29.073
He was offensive.

00:29.153 --> 00:31.513
He was obnoxious.

00:31.593 --> 00:33.513
He was disgusting.

00:33.593 --> 00:36.393
Do you want me to go on?

00:38.113 --> 00:41.033
Once he wanted me
to approve a contest

00:41.113 --> 00:43.073
where he would
give a new toilet

00:43.153 --> 00:46.673
to the listener with
the largest bowel movement.

00:48.033 --> 00:49.673
On the air.

00:49.753 --> 00:53.153
I mean, you can imagine
the logistics of that.

01:07.193 --> 01:10.993
Howard Stern: You know, when I
look back on this moment in my life,

01:11.073 --> 01:13.033
I really wanted it to work.

01:13.113 --> 01:15.593
I wanted this to be
the biggest moment

01:15.673 --> 01:18.073
in the history of entertainment.
I'm not kidding.

01:18.153 --> 01:20.713
I wanted everyone
to wake up the next morning

01:20.793 --> 01:22.993
talking about me,
Howard Stern.

01:23.073 --> 01:25.673
That's the kind
of thinking, though,

01:25.753 --> 01:28.233
that usually
gets me into trouble.

01:28.353 --> 01:31.673
John Stamos: I'm here to
introduce the next presenter.

01:31.753 --> 01:33.873
Believe me, a lot of people
refused to introduce this guy,

01:33.993 --> 01:34.873
but, uh...

01:34.993 --> 01:36.033
Is this safe?

01:36.113 --> 01:38.873
When you drop,
don't spin around

01:38.953 --> 01:40.153
or the wires
get screwed up.

01:41.233 --> 01:44.313
...Radio waves
high above America...

01:46.113 --> 01:47.553
It's a bird...

01:47.593 --> 01:49.433
I'm making such a mistake.

01:49.513 --> 01:50.993
It's a plane...

01:51.033 --> 01:54.833
No, it's Fartman!

01:57.233 --> 01:59.833
Howard:
Behold, I am Fartman.

01:59.913 --> 02:02.633
Behold, the greatest.
That is me.

02:02.713 --> 02:05.993
The mightiest
of superheroes.

02:06.073 --> 02:08.752
My ass has power!

02:08.833 --> 02:10.312
Screw Superman.

02:10.353 --> 02:13.593
I am Fartman.
Fartman rules.

02:13.673 --> 02:16.113
Fartman.

02:16.153 --> 02:17.633
Fartman!

02:23.953 --> 02:27.673
And now, in an extraordinary
display of my powers,

02:27.753 --> 02:30.393
I will show you
something so marvelous.

02:30.433 --> 02:31.393
Behold.

02:38.273 --> 02:42.873
The lovely and talented
Fartman, ladies and gentlemen.

02:52.073 --> 02:54.433
Howard: I got to tell you,
with all this carrying on,

02:54.513 --> 02:55.913
I mean, the way
they were screaming,

02:55.993 --> 02:57.833
at first I really thought
I'd won them over.

02:57.913 --> 03:00.673
I thought I was the Beatles
on Ed Sullivan or something.

03:00.753 --> 03:02.233
Oh, shock...

03:02.353 --> 03:04.633
But did my fellow artists
appreciate

03:04.713 --> 03:07.993
the comedically ironic aspect
of my new superhero character?

03:08.073 --> 03:10.873
No. They just thought
I was an idiot.

03:10.953 --> 03:14.313
You know, most of these people
are Satan-worshipping junkies.

03:18.113 --> 03:21.073
Hey, look, all I want
is for my artistic courage

03:21.153 --> 03:22.593
to be an inspiration
to others.

03:22.673 --> 03:23.633
Instead, I'm a joke.

03:23.753 --> 03:26.793
Excuse me. I didn't mean to interrupt.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.633
Embarrassing.

03:31.713 --> 03:33.953
See, that's when I came
to a profound realization...

03:33.993 --> 03:38.073
Everything I do
is misunderstood.

03:38.153 --> 03:39.073
Haah!

03:39.153 --> 03:41.193
Everything I do
is misunderstood.

03:41.273 --> 03:43.233
I mean, think about
what a burden that is.

03:43.313 --> 03:45.633
What a thing
to go through life with.

03:45.673 --> 03:47.513
All I'm trying to do
is be funny,

03:47.593 --> 03:50.793
and I end up
feeling like an asshole.

03:50.873 --> 03:53.193
What a fucking jerk.

03:57.793 --> 04:00.033
Howard, it was a home run.

04:00.113 --> 04:01.193
You think so?

04:01.273 --> 04:03.673
Absolutely.
And when you said,

04:03.753 --> 04:06.313
"All of Hollywood
can kiss my ass,"

04:06.393 --> 04:10.233
you had every teenager in the
country eating out of your hand.

04:10.273 --> 04:13.393
My guess is we'll get
coverage from 200, maybe 300...

04:26.593 --> 04:28.033
Howard.

04:29.273 --> 04:31.713
Howard...
here's your ticket.

04:31.753 --> 04:34.713
OK? Now call me as soon as
you get to New York, will you?

04:34.793 --> 04:36.673
Yo, Fartman.
Love you, man.

04:36.753 --> 04:38.353
Thanks.

04:38.393 --> 04:41.553
All right. So getting back
to what I was talking about...

04:41.633 --> 04:45.433
More than anything, I'd like
the public to appreciate me.

04:45.473 --> 04:48.833
No, forget that.
I want them to love me...

04:48.873 --> 04:50.353
Not the myth, but the man.

04:50.433 --> 04:52.233
The real Howard.

04:52.273 --> 04:54.273
Let me demonstrate my point.

04:54.313 --> 04:55.273
Thank you.

04:55.313 --> 04:56.793
Now, take this woman,
for example.

04:56.913 --> 04:58.353
She hates me.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.073
She doesn't even know me,

05:01.113 --> 05:04.513
but it's clear that she's
totally disgusted by me.

05:04.553 --> 05:05.913
Down the aisle
on your right.

05:05.953 --> 05:07.233
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

05:07.313 --> 05:08.633
You don't possibly have
another seat available for me?

05:08.713 --> 05:10.513
I'm sorry.
We're showing a full load.

05:12.113 --> 05:13.113
Right here on your left.

05:13.193 --> 05:14.473
Full load.

05:14.553 --> 05:18.433
Yes.
Sir, may I help you?

05:18.473 --> 05:19.913
To your right.

05:20.993 --> 05:22.913
Hello.

05:22.993 --> 05:24.953
Is this yours?

05:25.073 --> 05:27.553
Yeah. If you want
to read it, you can.

05:27.673 --> 05:29.113
Thank you.

05:34.553 --> 05:38.193
Pfft, I've seen
this look before,

05:38.273 --> 05:39.913
believe me.

05:39.993 --> 05:42.513
It's the look
of misunderstanding.

05:42.593 --> 05:44.753
She thinks I'm a moron.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.713
In fact, all my life,
people have told me I was a moron.

05:47.793 --> 05:51.233
You're a moron.
Now shut up and sit still.

05:52.833 --> 05:55.793
So this is my dad Ben Stern.

05:55.873 --> 05:58.993
He was an engineer
at a radio station in Manhattan... WHOM.

05:59.073 --> 06:01.833
Why do we live in Roosevelt
when you work in New York?

06:01.913 --> 06:02.953
Shut up.

06:04.593 --> 06:06.953
We never played catch
or went to ball games.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.793
The only sport
my father liked was yelling.

06:08.873 --> 06:09.793
Nothing but crap.

06:12.593 --> 06:15.153
- Is this one crap?
- Don't be a moron.

06:15.233 --> 06:18.353
# Shut up your mouth,
That is your daddy #

06:18.393 --> 06:19.433
# Oh, no #

06:19.513 --> 06:22.153
# My daddy
can't be ugly so #

06:22.193 --> 06:24.313
# Shut your mouth,
go away #

06:24.393 --> 06:26.753
# Ooh, Mama
look-a boo boo day #

06:26.833 --> 06:27.753
Huh!

06:27.833 --> 06:28.753
# Shut your mouth... #

06:28.833 --> 06:30.353
My father
commuted every day,

06:30.473 --> 06:32.433
I guess it was, about 40 miles
into Manhattan.

06:32.473 --> 06:35.273
He'd leave at 7:00 in the morning,
get home around midnight or something.

06:35.313 --> 06:36.273
I mean, I never saw the guy.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.313
Come on. Come on.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.713
Once a year, my old man
would break down

06:39.873 --> 06:40.993
and take me
to work with him.

06:41.073 --> 06:42.313
A little quality time.

06:42.353 --> 06:44.073
I liked that.
A little bonding.

06:44.153 --> 06:46.113
Dad and son together.

06:46.193 --> 06:47.633
I looked forward to that.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.993
Take my hand,
Howard.

06:51.033 --> 06:52.473
And remember, Howard,

06:52.553 --> 06:54.513
I work here,
so keep your mouth shut.

06:54.593 --> 06:56.033
# Never know
how much I love you... #

06:56.153 --> 06:58.473
You spin and you spin
and you spin.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.473
Records...
Who gives a damn?

07:01.553 --> 07:02.473
Daddy.

07:02.553 --> 07:03.753
I told you, shut up.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.873
That man's
throwing records.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.873
No, nobody gives
a goddamn about it.

07:07.913 --> 07:09.753
None of it.
What the fuck is it?

07:09.833 --> 07:12.633
Just fucking records!
It's just this fucking place.

07:12.713 --> 07:14.153
None of it means anything.
It's empty...

07:14.233 --> 07:16.473
Sid, you're on
in 15 seconds.

07:16.553 --> 07:17.873
Get a grip on yourself!

07:17.953 --> 07:19.233
Ah, what the hell
do you know, you bastard?

07:19.353 --> 07:20.553
You mieskait!

07:20.633 --> 07:23.473
You're gonna play the music
for the people? It doesn't...

07:23.553 --> 07:24.473
Symphony Sid!

07:24.553 --> 07:26.833
By the powers vested in me

07:26.913 --> 07:28.873
by the Federal
Communications Commission,

07:28.993 --> 07:30.233
I command you

07:30.353 --> 07:33.433
to get on the microphone
in a serious manner

07:33.513 --> 07:35.513
and continue this broadcast.

07:46.513 --> 07:49.273
Deep, Calm Voice: This is
Sunday Blues And Jazz,

07:49.353 --> 07:51.873
and I'm your host
Symphony Sid.

07:51.953 --> 07:56.113
And now... something
for a blue Sunday.

07:56.193 --> 07:59.473
Howard: From that moment on,
I wanted to be on the radio.

07:59.553 --> 08:01.913
Show business
was definitely for me.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.193
And for my 12th birthday, my
mother bought me some puppets,

08:08.273 --> 08:11.873
and pretty soon, I was spreading
joy throughout the community.

08:11.953 --> 08:14.033
# Biddi-bim-bom,
ay-yi-yi #

08:14.113 --> 08:15.153
# Biddi-biddi-biddi #

08:15.273 --> 08:16.593
# Biddi-biddi-biddi-biddi #

08:16.673 --> 08:18.033
# Biddi-biddi-biddi... #

08:18.113 --> 08:21.193
Howard, As The Woman:
Oh, baby, I want it. Give it to me.

08:21.313 --> 08:22.793
More. More. Ohh!

08:22.913 --> 08:23.873
Howard, As The Man:
You like that, huh?

08:23.953 --> 08:26.193
Oh, yes, I love it, baby.
Give it to me.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.953
Oh, baby, yes!
Right there. Ohh!

08:29.033 --> 08:30.913
Oh, more! Harder!

08:30.993 --> 08:31.993
You want it harder?

08:32.113 --> 08:34.393
Oh, yes, harder.
Please give it to me, please.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.232
Ohh! Aah! Aah!

08:37.313 --> 08:39.753
But why can't I play
with my puppets?

08:39.832 --> 08:42.193
Shut up! You know why.

08:42.273 --> 08:44.033
Ah...

08:47.193 --> 08:49.673
You know,
life is very strange.

08:49.713 --> 08:51.513
Nat King Cole:
# Pretend you're happy... #

08:51.593 --> 08:53.513
Just about the time
my puppet career ended,

08:53.553 --> 08:56.553
my whole neighborhood
underwent a demographic shift.

08:56.593 --> 08:58.953
My parents said we're moving
because of those niggers.

08:58.993 --> 09:01.713
They said pretty soon, Roosevelt's
going to be nothing but niggers.

09:01.793 --> 09:03.553
Really? My parents
said we're moving

09:03.633 --> 09:04.753
because of
all the Shvartzes.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.713
Shvartzes are niggers,
idiot.

09:06.793 --> 09:07.753
They're the same thing.

09:09.913 --> 09:12.393
I don't want to hear any more
of this, you hear me?

09:12.473 --> 09:15.353
I'm half negro,
and Howard's half negro.

09:15.473 --> 09:17.073
And anything bad
you say about negroes,

09:17.153 --> 09:18.673
you're saying about us,
you understand?

09:18.793 --> 09:23.913
# And nothing's bad
as it may seem... #

09:23.993 --> 09:26.433
Mom, we're half negro?

09:30.833 --> 09:33.313
I can't believe
the stories he makes up.

09:33.353 --> 09:36.793
I mean, I never made him
wear my underwear to school.

09:36.833 --> 09:39.673
And... And as far as my taking
his rectal temperature

09:39.753 --> 09:41.513
every day till he was 14...

09:41.593 --> 09:43.833
He shouldn't make
such a big deal.

09:43.913 --> 09:46.593
He still grew up to be
a very well-adjusted individual.

09:46.633 --> 09:47.633
Absolutely.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.393
# Papa was
a rolling stone... #

09:50.473 --> 09:52.953
Roosevelt High School...
beautiful.

09:53.033 --> 09:55.633
A fully integrated
educational institution,

09:55.713 --> 09:58.593
which of course meant
6,000 black guys and me.

09:58.673 --> 10:00.113
And then I hit puberty.

10:00.153 --> 10:01.393
That made things worse

10:01.473 --> 10:03.393
because my penis
never got any bigger.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.113
I mean, I was hung
like a 3-year-old.

10:05.193 --> 10:09.153
Hey, seriously, these guys had
rhinoceros penises... huge.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.873
You know, I've heard
black men complain

10:11.953 --> 10:13.273
that they're
unfairly stereotyped.

10:13.353 --> 10:16.793
Man, I'd love to have
a stereotype like that.

10:16.913 --> 10:19.833
Now, because I had
such a minuscule schlonger,

10:19.913 --> 10:21.233
I turned to drugs.

10:21.273 --> 10:24.713
Unfortunately, the drugs
really made me paranoid.

10:29.753 --> 10:33.153
Howard's Mother: Howard, I smell smoke.
Are you smoking in there?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.953
There's no smoke
in here.

10:35.033 --> 10:38.033
Howard, your father wants to
see you downstairs.

10:43.313 --> 10:45.033
Howard.

10:48.113 --> 10:50.273
Howard, you're graduating
from high school this year.

10:50.353 --> 10:52.593
You should be making some kind
of plan for your future.

10:52.633 --> 10:53.633
You need a plan.

10:53.713 --> 10:56.233
I want to be on the radio.

10:56.353 --> 10:58.273
He wants to be on radio.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.513
But to be on the radio,
you have to have a voice.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.273
You have to have
some verbal ability.

11:02.313 --> 11:04.353
You hardly ever say a word.

11:04.473 --> 11:08.313
This all from a guy who's only told me
to shut up about 50,000 times.

11:08.393 --> 11:09.793
I talk.

11:10.873 --> 11:13.713
You really want to be
on the radio?

11:15.473 --> 11:18.793
OK. If you want
a shot at radio,

11:18.873 --> 11:22.353
the counseling center says
there's a communications program

11:22.433 --> 11:23.633
at Boston University.

11:33.673 --> 11:36.073
OK, I know
what you're saying.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.873
You're saying I look
a little old to be in college.

11:38.913 --> 11:41.953
Well, for this movie,
you gotta suspend disbelief.

11:42.073 --> 11:43.873
Hey, Lisa.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.353
Lisa.
Hi, how you doing?

11:46.393 --> 11:47.593
Hi.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.313
I was wondering if you'd
like to go out Friday night.

11:50.393 --> 11:51.513
With you?

11:51.593 --> 11:53.233
No, thanks.

11:55.353 --> 11:58.233
Hi. I was just
wondering if you...

11:58.313 --> 11:59.753
Uh, no.

12:04.833 --> 12:07.233
- Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

12:07.273 --> 12:08.273
Excuse me.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.273
Would you like to
go out Friday night?

12:10.313 --> 12:11.753
Friday?

12:16.953 --> 12:20.113
No. I have a lot of reading
to catch up on,

12:20.193 --> 12:22.633
but thank you.

12:22.713 --> 12:26.153
So I masturbated a lot...
2- time-a-day habit.

12:26.233 --> 12:28.233
I'm not proud of it,
but I did it.

12:28.273 --> 12:30.113
Senior year...
Big year for me.

12:30.193 --> 12:31.193
I finally
got up the courage

12:31.313 --> 12:32.873
to go down
to the college radio station

12:32.993 --> 12:34.153
and get myself on the air.

12:34.233 --> 12:36.153
And my name
is Howard Stern

12:36.233 --> 12:38.233
on the Howard Stern
Experience,

12:38.353 --> 12:42.793
and if you love music,
you'll love Deep Purple on TBU.

12:56.793 --> 12:57.713
Ohh!

12:57.793 --> 12:59.313
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

12:59.393 --> 13:00.633
Ooh!

13:00.713 --> 13:03.633
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

13:07.393 --> 13:08.393
How do I forget it?

13:08.513 --> 13:09.873
It's the single worst moment
in radio history.

13:09.953 --> 13:11.193
It's not radio.

13:11.273 --> 13:13.233
It's college radio.

13:13.313 --> 13:14.513
There's
nobody listening.

13:14.593 --> 13:17.033
Nobody. Maybe, like,
3 guys in a dorm somewhere.

13:17.113 --> 13:18.753
Oh, shit.

13:18.833 --> 13:19.873
Oh, fuck.

13:19.953 --> 13:21.833
I know someone on this block.
Let me think.

13:21.913 --> 13:24.753
Come on.
We're getting wet.

13:24.873 --> 13:25.753
Down here. Down here.
Down here.

13:26.513 --> 13:27.473
Hi, Elyse.

13:27.553 --> 13:28.833
Hey.

13:28.913 --> 13:31.153
So, we were on our way to a rally
in support of feminism,

13:31.193 --> 13:32.753
and we got caught
in the rain.

13:32.793 --> 13:35.073
I'm wondering if we can come in
and just hang out for awhile.

13:35.153 --> 13:36.953
Sure,
come on in.

13:37.033 --> 13:39.113
Howard: Can I use
your hair dryer?

13:39.193 --> 13:42.793
Yeah, there's one at the end
of the hall. Hey, Rach.

13:42.873 --> 13:44.033
Hi, Ellen.
This is Howard.

13:44.113 --> 13:45.593
Oh, hi.
My hair's wet.

13:45.673 --> 13:46.633
Put that there.

13:46.673 --> 13:48.393
I'm just going to go
dry my hair.

13:48.473 --> 13:50.433
Hey, I heard you
on the radio today.

13:50.513 --> 13:51.633
You heard that?

13:51.713 --> 13:53.073
Yeah. What happened?

13:53.113 --> 13:55.153
I didn't think anybody
even listened to that.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.793
Alison, this is Howard.
Howard, this is Alison.

13:56.873 --> 13:57.793
Alison's
one of my roommates.

13:57.873 --> 13:58.793
Hey.

14:07.993 --> 14:09.913
Howard.

14:09.993 --> 14:12.553
Hair dryer's
in the bathroom.

14:15.793 --> 14:17.833
Hi. Hi.

14:18.913 --> 14:20.193
Hi, I'm Howard.

14:20.273 --> 14:21.473
Look at you, man.

14:21.553 --> 14:23.273
You can get her.
You can get her.

14:23.313 --> 14:24.713
She looks hot.

14:26.753 --> 14:28.193
How are you?

14:28.273 --> 14:30.073
I'm making a film
for my film class,

14:30.153 --> 14:31.553
and, I mean,
it's a legitimate film.

14:31.593 --> 14:33.553
You won't... You're not gonna
be naked or anything.

14:33.593 --> 14:34.793
You'll have your clothes on,
you know.

14:34.873 --> 14:36.113
What's it about?

14:36.193 --> 14:37.873
Well, I'm glad
you asked me that.

14:37.953 --> 14:42.233
In my, um, psychology class,
we're studying B.F. Skinner,

14:42.313 --> 14:46.753
and I started to realize that
what Skinner says is true...

14:46.833 --> 14:48.913
We're all rats
trapped in a box,

14:48.993 --> 14:50.473
all searching
for a piece of cheese.

14:50.513 --> 14:52.273
Mm-hmm.

14:52.353 --> 14:53.793
And I'm going to shoot it
on Saturday.

14:53.873 --> 14:56.833
I mean, I can't do it
Saturday.

14:56.913 --> 15:00.073
I work with an outpatient program
for schizophrenics.

15:00.153 --> 15:01.633
One of them actually
killed himself,

15:01.713 --> 15:03.033
so I'm taking
the whole group to...

15:03.113 --> 15:05.233
to the funeral
on Saturday, but...

15:05.313 --> 15:06.713
Sorry.

15:06.753 --> 15:09.433
You are really perfect.

15:09.513 --> 15:13.113
I... All right.
What if I reschedule?

15:14.273 --> 15:17.313
Beautiful. Beautiful.
I don't believe it.

15:17.393 --> 15:19.193
Howard: Look, I refused
to leave the room

15:19.273 --> 15:20.633
until she agreed
to be in my film.

15:20.713 --> 15:22.033
I feel stupid.

15:22.113 --> 15:24.433
Seriously, she was the most
enchanting woman I'd ever met.

15:24.473 --> 15:26.633
I'm telling you, I am looking
for the face of an angel.

15:26.713 --> 15:27.673
You have
the face of an angel.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.913
Howard's Voice: Save me.

15:34.273 --> 15:37.273
Save me.

15:37.353 --> 15:42.273
He comes to me.

15:42.353 --> 15:45.193
Ahh...

15:45.273 --> 15:47.273
Save me.

15:53.673 --> 15:56.433
We give the award
for best student film

15:56.513 --> 15:59.673
to... Mr. Howard Stern.

16:04.913 --> 16:07.153
I'll tell you,
nothing makes a woman hotter

16:07.233 --> 16:08.993
than to be with
an award-winning filmmaker.

16:09.073 --> 16:10.073
This I know.

16:10.153 --> 16:11.913
And at this point,
I knew I was gonna score.

16:11.993 --> 16:13.353
I mean,
it was fait accompli.

16:13.433 --> 16:15.273
I was in. This was it.

16:15.353 --> 16:18.313
I'm a stud.
She was liquefied.

16:18.393 --> 16:20.193
We did not have sex
on our first date,

16:20.273 --> 16:22.593
although
he was very sexual.

16:22.673 --> 16:24.913
Our sex life
has always been good.

16:24.993 --> 16:28.233
I mean, Howard complains
that his penis is too small,

16:28.273 --> 16:30.793
but his penis size is fine.

16:30.873 --> 16:32.793
Howard exaggerates.

16:35.673 --> 16:37.113
- OK.
- Now hold this and say...

16:37.153 --> 16:38.593
Hi.
Hi, I'm Camille,

16:38.673 --> 16:41.273
and, uh, I'm in Westchester,
New York, and...

16:41.353 --> 16:42.993
This is Howard's
first job interview.

16:43.073 --> 16:45.433
And this is Howard's
first job interview.

16:45.513 --> 16:47.993
Well, he's going to his first
job interview in New York.

16:48.073 --> 16:48.993
All right...

16:49.073 --> 16:49.993
- One more thing.
- Yes?

16:50.073 --> 16:50.993
Can you
take your top off?

16:51.073 --> 16:52.393
- No.
- No, I'm serious.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.153
I'm serious. That's what
they want you to do.

16:54.233 --> 16:55.953
- No, they do not.
- Yeah, they do.

16:56.033 --> 16:56.993
- No way.
- No, they do.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.233
Howard did not
tell me...

17:09.673 --> 17:11.593
I'm Moti,
station manager.

17:11.673 --> 17:13.992
- Howard Stern.
- You want to be a disc jockey?

17:14.073 --> 17:15.913
Very much so.
I've wanted to be a disc jockey

17:15.953 --> 17:16.913
since I was
7 years old.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.713
What are you,
an idiot?

17:18.792 --> 17:21.032
No, sir,
I'm not an idiot.

17:21.113 --> 17:24.153
I... In fact, I have a communications
degree from Boston University,

17:24.233 --> 17:25.953
and I would work very hard
for this company

17:25.992 --> 17:26.953
if given
the opportunity to...

17:26.992 --> 17:27.953
You wanted
to see me?

17:28.032 --> 17:29.673
You came late yesterday.

17:29.753 --> 17:31.993
You came late today.
I don't need you. You're fired.

17:32.073 --> 17:33.833
Fuck you.

17:33.873 --> 17:34.993
Good. Fuck you.

17:35.073 --> 17:37.353
You punk!
Fuck you 1,000%% %!

17:37.433 --> 17:38.673
Fuck you
till your asshole

17:38.753 --> 17:40.393
is perfect
donkey asshole!

17:42.153 --> 17:44.193
OK,
you start tomorrow.

17:44.273 --> 17:47.113
10 a.m. To 2 p.m., eh?

17:47.153 --> 17:48.313
Yes.

17:48.393 --> 17:50.353
Pay $96 a week and don't
bring me your problems.

17:50.433 --> 17:51.353
OK.

17:51.433 --> 17:52.633
I'm not psychiatrist.

17:52.713 --> 17:54.713
Thank you very much.

17:54.753 --> 17:57.273
I promise you
I will not disappoint you.

17:57.353 --> 17:58.953
Thank you.

17:59.033 --> 18:00.473
And I start
tomorrow?

18:00.553 --> 18:04.233
Wimpy Voice: Westchester 107,
WRNW 107.

18:04.313 --> 18:08.153
Hi, this is Howard Stern,
and it's 75 degrees presently,

18:08.233 --> 18:10.033
winds out of the northwest.

18:10.113 --> 18:13.793
Chance of precipitation,
85%% % for tonight.

18:13.873 --> 18:15.313
Looks like rain.

18:15.393 --> 18:19.993
Tomorrow, partly sunny
at WRNW, Westchester 107.

18:22.953 --> 18:25.753
I was sort of living
with Alison

18:25.833 --> 18:29.353
while she worked on her Master's
of social work, which was really great.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.353
I was also still living
with my parents...

18:31.393 --> 18:32.353
Howard's Mother:
Howard?

18:32.393 --> 18:33.353
Which wasn't so great.

18:33.393 --> 18:34.753
Yeah. Yeah, ma?

18:34.793 --> 18:37.233
I smell smoke.
Are you smoking in there?

18:37.313 --> 18:40.193
No, Ma.
There's no smoke in here.

18:40.233 --> 18:43.033
Wimpy Voice:
107 FM, WRNW.

18:43.113 --> 18:45.313
I'm Howard Stern
with you each and every day,

18:45.393 --> 18:47.633
and I've got a great
two for Tuesday.

18:47.673 --> 18:51.593
107 FM... The Ramones...
Gabba gabba wee,

18:51.673 --> 18:52.633
Gabba gabba hey,

18:52.713 --> 18:55.153
Gabba gabba gabba gabba...

19:05.993 --> 19:07.513
Howard, you stink.

19:07.593 --> 19:10.553
I don't mince words.
You will never be a great disc jockey.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.673
You have lousy voice, lousy personality,
and this will not change.

19:13.753 --> 19:16.473
OK? So on the air
is not for you.

19:16.553 --> 19:20.673
But you come on time,
and you are good worker, huh?

19:20.753 --> 19:22.273
So...

19:22.353 --> 19:25.193
how about I make you...

19:25.273 --> 19:26.393
program director?

19:29.753 --> 19:31.193
Program director?

19:31.273 --> 19:33.553
Program... director.

19:33.633 --> 19:35.713
You. You.

19:35.793 --> 19:38.153
You run station.

19:38.193 --> 19:39.633
You... sit.

19:39.713 --> 19:41.593
You pick music.

19:41.633 --> 19:43.633
No more $96 a week.

19:43.713 --> 19:45.473
Eh. I pay you...

19:45.553 --> 19:47.033
you, eh?

19:47.113 --> 19:50.233
$250 a week.

19:52.073 --> 19:55.113
You be management...
like me.

19:55.273 --> 19:58.153
To be quite honest, I didn't really
want to be a programmer.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.713
But at $250 a week,
I could marry Alison,

20:00.753 --> 20:02.353
and we'd get
a real place together.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.473
Oh, look at her.
I mean, this was a miracle.

20:05.553 --> 20:07.673
Here's this beautiful girl,

20:07.753 --> 20:08.953
I mean, a gorgeous woman,

20:09.033 --> 20:10.433
willing to spend
the rest of her life with me.

20:10.513 --> 20:13.153
I just couldn't
have been happier.

20:13.233 --> 20:16.913
I was the happiest
program director in the world.

20:16.993 --> 20:18.833
Yeah, me.
Program director.

20:18.913 --> 20:20.713
Overnight,
I become the big boss.

20:20.793 --> 20:23.073
Howard Stern,
executive manager.

20:23.153 --> 20:25.233
I had no idea
what I was doing,

20:25.273 --> 20:27.673
no clue what to do
with this job whatsoever,

20:27.713 --> 20:30.193
but I did it, and everyone
bought into it.

20:30.273 --> 20:32.873
They thought I knew what I was doing.
This was great.

20:32.913 --> 20:33.873
Howard.

20:33.913 --> 20:34.913
Oh, hey, Moti.

20:34.953 --> 20:37.433
Advertising is up.
Profit is up.

20:37.513 --> 20:38.713
Oh, great.

20:38.793 --> 20:41.433
As a disc jockey, you're...
you're shit... ha ha ha ha...

20:41.513 --> 20:43.993
But you are a great programmer.
Here, payday.

20:44.033 --> 20:44.993
Thanks, Moti.

20:45.033 --> 20:48.913
Listen, I want you
to fire Dickie Davis.

20:48.993 --> 20:49.913
But why?

20:49.993 --> 20:51.513
None of your business.

20:51.593 --> 20:52.753
The guy's got 3 kids.

20:52.833 --> 20:55.353
You want to be management,
you fire him, huh?

20:55.433 --> 20:57.473
It's good to fire someone. It gives
a good message to the others.

20:57.553 --> 20:58.993
Just fire him, huh?

20:59.073 --> 21:01.633
I don't want to fire him.
You fire him.

21:01.713 --> 21:02.673
Howard...

21:02.713 --> 21:04.753
disc jockeys are dogs.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.073
Your job is to make them
fetch, eh?

21:07.153 --> 21:08.913
Now, if you want
to truly be management,

21:08.993 --> 21:10.673
you be a man
and fire him.

21:10.753 --> 21:13.353
Do it. Be a man.

21:21.873 --> 21:24.833
Moti: Tell Dickie Davis
Howard wants to see him now.

21:34.713 --> 21:36.593
How? Howard?

21:36.673 --> 21:37.593
Don't look.

21:37.673 --> 21:38.833
You OK?

21:41.113 --> 21:43.793
Let me ask you something.
Would you still love me...

21:43.873 --> 21:45.473
if I gave up
my programming job,

21:45.553 --> 21:47.833
and I stayed on the air,
and I made a lot less money?

21:47.913 --> 21:51.033
Yes. I mean, you know,
I'd have to leave you,

21:51.113 --> 21:53.753
but I'd still love you.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.393
Be serious.

21:55.473 --> 21:59.193
If I make less money, we wouldn't
even be able to afford this apartment.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.793
Well, we can't really
afford the apartment now,

22:01.833 --> 22:03.673
so it doesn't quite matter,
really.

22:03.753 --> 22:05.273
I guess.

22:07.473 --> 22:10.433
Do what you need to do.

22:11.753 --> 22:13.953
Come on back here,
hold this sign...

22:14.033 --> 22:16.033
right in front of you.
Come on back.

22:16.113 --> 22:18.473
I want you to say
"Howard goes to Hartford

22:18.553 --> 22:21.433
and becomes the wacky
morning man at WCCC."

22:21.513 --> 22:24.193
Howard goes to Hartford at CCC.

22:24.273 --> 22:27.633
"Howard goes to Hartford and becomes
the wacky morning man at WCCC."

22:27.713 --> 22:30.153
Howard goes to Hartford
at W...

22:30.233 --> 22:32.353
All right, all right,
that's not going to work.

22:32.433 --> 22:35.353
Howard comes to Hartford
to become the wacky morning man

22:35.433 --> 22:36.753
at WCCC.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.673
Gary: Let's see
some muscles.

22:39.753 --> 22:41.793
Gary: How about
some back muscles?

22:41.873 --> 22:44.313
Was my voice too deep
doing that?

22:44.353 --> 22:45.313
No. It's very feminine.

22:55.113 --> 22:59.153
WCCC, FM 107 and AM 1290.

22:59.273 --> 23:01.353
My name is Fred Norris,
and, uh...

23:01.433 --> 23:03.593
stick around for
the new guy Howard Stern

23:03.633 --> 23:05.593
And the Howard Stern
program.

23:07.433 --> 23:08.553
Hi.

23:08.633 --> 23:11.433
Oh. Oh, my God.

23:11.473 --> 23:13.713
Oh, it's so...

23:13.793 --> 23:14.913
Hi,
I'm Howard Stern.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.673
How you doing?
You're Fred.

23:16.713 --> 23:18.713
I can't believe
how late I am.

23:18.753 --> 23:20.073
Who would've thought?

23:20.113 --> 23:22.673
I'm on the Berlin turnpike,
and I take a left-hand turn,

23:22.753 --> 23:25.953
and I've rehearsed this 500 times,
getting here, and I somehow got lost.

23:26.033 --> 23:26.993
Ohh.

23:28.273 --> 23:29.753
I'm sweating.

23:29.793 --> 23:32.313
I'm so hot.

23:32.393 --> 23:33.713
I'm so tahitzed.

23:33.793 --> 23:35.793
I'm hot.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.753
I was planning
on being on time.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.113
Whoo, man.

23:45.193 --> 23:47.913
Whoo-oo-oo...

23:47.993 --> 23:52.473
107 FM, AM 1290, WCCC.
Good morning.

23:52.513 --> 23:55.153
My name is Howard Stern.
I'm the new morning man on CCC.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.833
Sitting with me,
uh, Mr. Ringo...

23:57.913 --> 24:01.593
Mr. Ringo Starr,
and he's here in the studio.

24:01.673 --> 24:02.633
Hi, Ringo.

24:02.713 --> 24:04.193
How you doin', me love?

24:04.273 --> 24:06.153
I wish you'd play us a little
Wipeout this morning,

24:06.193 --> 24:07.353
Wake everybody up.

24:12.193 --> 24:14.353
Oh, yeah,
that was great, Ringo.

24:14.433 --> 24:16.633
CCC, AM 1290, FM 107.

24:16.673 --> 24:18.113
This is Cheap Trick.

24:21.633 --> 24:23.313
Ohh. Thank you.

24:23.393 --> 24:25.553
Whoa.

24:25.633 --> 24:27.873
Howard: Hartford ended up
being OK, you know.

24:27.913 --> 24:29.473
I mean, Fred seemed
to really like me.

24:29.553 --> 24:31.033
I mean, I think
he really liked me.

24:31.113 --> 24:32.793
The guy's like wallpaper.
Who can get a read on him?

24:32.873 --> 24:34.593
And Alison, well,
she got a job right away.

24:34.673 --> 24:37.593
Now, if you wanted
to buy liver for dinner,

24:37.673 --> 24:39.113
what would you do?

24:39.193 --> 24:41.273
Go to the...
supermarket?

24:41.393 --> 24:43.873
That's right.
And then what?

24:43.953 --> 24:45.673
This afternoon...
Gray skies,

24:45.753 --> 24:48.673
occasional showers,
and precipitation.

24:48.753 --> 24:50.753
Highs near 75.

24:50.833 --> 24:53.033
It's going to be
raining like cats...

24:54.873 --> 24:56.793
And chickens,
I don't think so.

24:57.993 --> 24:59.273
And dogs.

24:59.313 --> 25:00.953
WCCC also wants
to remind you

25:01.033 --> 25:02.793
that our new sponsor
Stanley Sport,

25:02.873 --> 25:05.913
um, is a great place
to go.

25:05.993 --> 25:07.953
You know, I got to tell you something.
When I was a child,

25:07.993 --> 25:10.113
I used to go to Stanley Sport
all the time.

25:10.193 --> 25:11.673
I loved Stanley Sport.

25:11.753 --> 25:14.313
My parents would take me through there,
and we just had a great time.

25:14.393 --> 25:15.953
And we could walk out
with tons of stuff

25:16.033 --> 25:18.233
even though my parents
didn't make a lot of money.

25:18.313 --> 25:19.913
Oh.

25:19.993 --> 25:22.593
And, uh, "There's only
one Stanley Sports,

25:22.673 --> 25:24.993
"and the grand opening
is this weekend.

25:25.073 --> 25:27.153
Mark it on your calendar."

25:28.673 --> 25:30.273
The grand opening
is this...

25:30.353 --> 25:33.313
I just realized, uh... that makes
no sense what I just said.

25:33.393 --> 25:35.713
I just told you I went there as a kid,
and now the grand opening...

25:35.793 --> 25:39.313
Well, I just...
I think I was just caught in a lie.

25:39.433 --> 25:41.753
Oh, boy. You know
what the truth is?

25:41.833 --> 25:44.433
I'm a disc jockey
who makes $250 a week,

25:44.513 --> 25:46.673
and I just want to do
the right thing here on the air.

25:46.753 --> 25:49.713
I don't want to get fired,
so, uh, I guess I lied to you,

25:49.793 --> 25:52.913
but, uh, I'll never let that
happen again. You know what I mean?

25:52.993 --> 25:54.593
Oh, boy, do I feel stupid.

25:56.593 --> 25:58.753
Seriously, I heard
the show today.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.473
I think you're
really getting good.

26:00.553 --> 26:02.033
What part did you
like in particular?

26:02.073 --> 26:04.873
Was it the Chinese guy calling in
for the Doobie Brothers tickets?

26:04.953 --> 26:08.553
You know when you did that ad,
when you were just being yourself?

26:08.633 --> 26:09.953
That's what
you liked?

26:10.033 --> 26:11.673
Yeah.

26:11.753 --> 26:13.153
Really?

26:13.193 --> 26:15.033
It was funny.

26:15.193 --> 26:18.753
# Gonna use my arms,
gonna use my legs... #

26:18.793 --> 26:20.073
Howard: Little by little,

26:20.153 --> 26:21.353
our ratings
actually improved,

26:21.473 --> 26:23.393
and before long,
I got to interview

26:23.473 --> 26:24.873
my first real
semifamous celebrity,

26:24.953 --> 26:27.193
"B" movie star
Brittany Fairchild.

26:27.273 --> 26:28.553
While I'm
interviewing her,

26:28.633 --> 26:29.873
she actually invites me

26:29.953 --> 26:31.913
to go to a premiere
for her movie.

26:31.993 --> 26:33.473
I remember
how embarrassing it was

26:33.513 --> 26:35.233
because nobody
knew who I was.

26:35.273 --> 26:36.473
I'm escorting
this woman around,

26:36.553 --> 26:38.313
and none of these people
know who I am.

26:38.393 --> 26:40.993
They just think she has
some ugly boyfriend, you know?

26:41.073 --> 26:43.393
But who cared?
I mean, it was exciting.

26:58.113 --> 27:00.873
Woman In Movie: Hello?

27:06.873 --> 27:08.553
I'm here for the shoot.

27:13.353 --> 27:14.593
Is anybody there?

27:19.953 --> 27:21.873
Hello?

27:23.873 --> 27:25.713
Howard: Ohh.

27:27.633 --> 27:29.833
My back hurts.

27:29.913 --> 27:33.193
Would you mind taking me
back to my hotel room?

27:34.593 --> 27:36.073
I know this director,

27:36.113 --> 27:37.833
and he told me that
when he was little,

27:37.913 --> 27:39.873
his mother
killed his sister,

27:39.913 --> 27:41.673
but was never charged.

27:41.713 --> 27:42.673
Wow.

27:42.713 --> 27:44.793
Come in.

27:45.913 --> 27:48.353
Come in.

27:52.793 --> 27:54.553
- It's nice.
- Sit down.

27:57.273 --> 27:59.353
I'll be right back.

27:59.433 --> 28:00.513
OK.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.553
Hey, man.

28:08.633 --> 28:10.833
Free drinks.

28:12.513 --> 28:14.233
Ahem.

28:19.473 --> 28:21.393
What the hell
is she doing?

28:23.593 --> 28:25.553
I think she's
running a bath.

28:32.873 --> 28:36.073
Oh, my God, man,
she's taking her clothes off.

28:36.153 --> 28:38.353
I guess she forgot
to close the door.

28:38.433 --> 28:39.793
Well, she's
a Hollywood actress.

28:39.833 --> 28:41.233
They have a lot
on their mind.

28:42.433 --> 28:45.033
Oh, my God.

28:48.153 --> 28:49.873
Oh, is she cute.

28:51.113 --> 28:52.113
Brittany: Howard?

28:52.193 --> 28:53.193
Yes?

28:53.273 --> 28:55.153
Could you come here
for a second?

29:10.033 --> 29:11.313
Oh. Hi.

29:11.393 --> 29:13.993
My shoulders tense up
when I travel.

29:14.073 --> 29:15.833
Would you mind
rubbing them for a minute?

29:15.913 --> 29:17.713
Works best when
I'm in a hot bath.

29:17.793 --> 29:19.593
It helps
relax the muscles.

29:19.673 --> 29:23.033
I don't know
if that's OK or not.

29:23.113 --> 29:26.353
Please.
It really hurts.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.713
Look, I don't know
that I can do this.

29:30.753 --> 29:32.393
I'll tell you what,
I'll just kneel over here,

29:32.473 --> 29:34.353
and I'll rub your shoulders
from back here.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.993
No. Sit behind me
in the tub.

29:37.073 --> 29:38.353
Oh, I can't do that.

29:38.433 --> 29:40.193
Why not?

29:40.273 --> 29:43.073
Well, for one thing,
my clothes are gonna get all wet.

29:43.153 --> 29:46.833
Well, then I guess
you better take them off.

29:46.913 --> 29:49.833
I got to tell you something.
You are gorgeous,

29:49.913 --> 29:51.433
And... And you're a great actress
and everything,

29:51.513 --> 29:53.993
but I got a wife at home.
I can't cheat on my wife.

29:54.073 --> 29:56.233
Then leave
your underwear on.

29:56.313 --> 29:58.273
What?

29:58.353 --> 30:01.633
If you leave your underwear on,
then you can't cheat.

30:01.713 --> 30:03.353
It's just like
going swimming.

30:03.433 --> 30:04.873
Howard: I don't know
what it was,

30:04.953 --> 30:07.513
but she started
making a lot of sense.

30:07.553 --> 30:08.833
I really
need your help.

30:08.913 --> 30:11.673
My back
really hurts.

30:11.753 --> 30:13.793
Fred: She's right.

30:16.233 --> 30:18.513
Could you start
with my shoulders?

30:21.953 --> 30:23.513
Ahh...

30:23.593 --> 30:24.873
yeah.

30:26.233 --> 30:27.313
Mmm.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.273
Can you come around
my sides?

30:30.313 --> 30:32.673
I think I pulled a muscle
in my rib cage.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.273
Mmm.

30:38.473 --> 30:40.673
Howard...

30:45.993 --> 30:48.153
I know how to give
a man pleasure.

30:49.433 --> 30:50.793
Mmm.

30:52.233 --> 30:53.713
Ooh. Oh.

30:53.793 --> 30:55.513
Pleasure.

30:57.673 --> 30:59.673
Oh. Oh, wow.

30:59.753 --> 31:02.073
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.633
Stop that. Stop.

31:03.713 --> 31:05.193
Oh, whoa.

31:05.273 --> 31:06.233
Oh, man.

31:06.313 --> 31:08.393
Wow. Thank you.
Oh, my.

31:08.473 --> 31:10.313
Thanks. Thanks...
Thanks for everything.

31:10.353 --> 31:11.633
Listen, the premiere
and everything.

31:11.713 --> 31:12.873
Oh, my God.

31:12.953 --> 31:14.953
I just...
I just got to go.

31:15.033 --> 31:17.193
You know, it was a great
interview on the radio.

31:17.273 --> 31:18.953
Thanks... Thanks...
Thank you.

31:18.993 --> 31:20.233
I really got to go.

31:20.313 --> 31:21.713
Good-bye!

31:22.873 --> 31:23.873
# I'll take you there #

31:23.953 --> 31:25.913
# Oh, oh #

31:25.993 --> 31:27.113
# Oh! #

31:27.193 --> 31:29.193
# I'll take you there #

31:30.913 --> 31:32.313
# Oh! Oh! Oh! #

31:32.393 --> 31:33.993
# I'll take you there #

31:35.433 --> 31:36.593
# Mercy now #

31:36.673 --> 31:37.793
# I'll take you there #

31:37.873 --> 31:39.233
# I'm callin',
callin' #

31:39.313 --> 31:41.553
# Callin'
for mercy #

31:41.633 --> 31:43.673
# I'll take you there #

31:43.753 --> 31:45.553
# Mercy, mercy #

31:47.793 --> 31:48.833
Hi.

31:48.913 --> 31:50.353
Hey. How was it?

31:50.393 --> 31:51.913
So bad. So horrible.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.673
I just had
the worst night of my life.

31:53.753 --> 31:56.273
I mean, I can't even begin
to tell you how miserable I am.

31:56.353 --> 31:57.993
It is so late.
I got to get to bed.

31:58.033 --> 31:59.553
I mean, no one
realizes I got to be up

31:59.633 --> 32:01.113
at 4:00 in the morning
in that radio station.

32:01.193 --> 32:02.513
I can't believe
how late it is.

32:02.593 --> 32:03.993
- Go up and get in...
- OK.

32:04.073 --> 32:05.193
I... I just...

32:05.273 --> 32:07.833
I just need to rest.
I need to get some sleep.

32:07.873 --> 32:09.153
Horrible.

32:11.913 --> 32:13.993
God, let me
get away with this,

32:14.073 --> 32:18.273
and I swear I'll never stray
from Alison again. Never.

32:18.353 --> 32:19.913
Howard On Radio: I just want
to thank someone this morning.

32:19.993 --> 32:21.393
I want to thank
Brittany Fairchild

32:21.473 --> 32:22.753
For having myself
and Fred

32:22.793 --> 32:24.793
out to, uh, her new movie.
It was really good.

32:24.873 --> 32:26.793
Fred, what'd you think
of the movie?

32:26.833 --> 32:28.353
Fred: I was very moved.

32:28.393 --> 32:30.233
I think a lot of us
were moved last night.

32:30.313 --> 32:33.153
CCC, AM 1290, FM 107...

32:57.673 --> 33:00.033
It's the fifth-largest market
in the United States,

33:00.113 --> 33:01.593
and they want me
to start tomorrow,

33:01.633 --> 33:03.153
which is a good sign,
I think.

33:03.233 --> 33:04.633
That means they're,
you know,

33:04.673 --> 33:07.113
they're really desperate
for me, which I like.

33:07.193 --> 33:10.913
And they say they're gonna move the
building to the best part of the city,

33:10.993 --> 33:13.873
which I think is good, too...
You know, pump money into the facility.

33:13.953 --> 33:15.633
And the station manager
says we are gonna be

33:15.673 --> 33:17.953
the most aggressive
radio station in Detroit.

33:18.033 --> 33:20.713
We are gonna dominate
the marketplace, which I lo...

33:26.113 --> 33:27.913
Are these yours?

33:30.593 --> 33:33.033
They're wet.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.193
Howard: Alison's not
coming to Detroit.

33:42.233 --> 33:44.473
I should have
just come home

33:44.553 --> 33:46.513
and told my wife everything,
admitted the truth,

33:46.593 --> 33:48.593
'cause now my wife
doesn't even trust me anymore,

33:48.673 --> 33:50.633
and I don't blame her because
I don't trust me, either.

33:50.713 --> 33:54.273
I'm a stupid idiot.
I'm so stupid!

33:54.353 --> 33:55.953
What am I gonna do?

33:56.033 --> 33:57.953
I don't know.

33:59.953 --> 34:01.833
I can always
count on you for help, man.

34:01.913 --> 34:03.313
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

34:09.033 --> 34:12.353
Listen, man, as soon as I get
to Detroit and things start happenin',

34:12.433 --> 34:14.913
I'm gonna get these guys
to hire you, all right?

34:14.993 --> 34:16.233
OK.

34:16.273 --> 34:19.193
Fred, I'm serious.
I'm not gonna forget ya.

34:19.273 --> 34:20.473
Bye.

34:35.353 --> 34:37.233
# Cat scratch fever... #

34:37.313 --> 34:38.793
Howard.
How you doing, man?

34:38.873 --> 34:40.072
How you doing, Marvin?

34:40.152 --> 34:41.873
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

34:41.953 --> 34:44.433
Hey, Patricia Fonfara,
meet Howard Stern. Your newslady.

34:44.473 --> 34:46.632
Hi. I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

34:46.713 --> 34:48.193
The Duke of rock's
just finishing up,

34:48.233 --> 34:50.233
and then we're gonna
get right inside, so...

34:50.313 --> 34:52.233
Hey, Marvin, what happened
to the new building?

34:52.273 --> 34:53.753
I told you, we're gonna
build a new building.

34:53.833 --> 34:56.193
First we got to build
an audience. Heh.

34:59.833 --> 35:01.713
Hey, the Duke of rock's
gettin' ready to walk,

35:01.793 --> 35:03.433
but I want you
to stick around,

35:03.513 --> 35:06.913
because we got
a brand-new morning man...

35:06.953 --> 35:09.393
looks like Big Bird
to me...

35:09.473 --> 35:10.953
coming next

35:11.033 --> 35:14.553
on W4106 FM.

35:14.633 --> 35:16.313
What's happening, man?

35:16.393 --> 35:17.833
Come on in, Big Bird.

35:17.873 --> 35:19.913
How you doing, man?
Good to see ya.

35:20.033 --> 35:22.873
How's things? What's that?
You're gonna do what?

35:22.953 --> 35:24.873
Is that ri... Well, now,
how about that, kiddies?

35:24.953 --> 35:27.753
He's gonna have Kermit the Frog
come in here and sing the Alphabet Song,

35:27.833 --> 35:28.753
isn't that somethin'?

35:28.833 --> 35:30.473
Coming up next
on the Big Bird show.

35:30.553 --> 35:32.193
I got to go. See you
at midnight tonight.

35:32.273 --> 35:33.513
This is the Duke of rock
saying,

35:33.593 --> 35:35.273
If you can't be good,
be bad, baby.

35:35.353 --> 35:36.473
Bye.

35:38.113 --> 35:39.873
Hi. How you doing?

35:39.953 --> 35:41.873
Howard Stern.
Nice to see you.

35:41.953 --> 35:43.913
Listened to your show
last night. It was great.

35:44.033 --> 35:45.473
Lookin' forward
to working with you.

35:45.553 --> 35:47.673
Don't hurt yourself,
man.

35:47.753 --> 35:49.553
OK, thanks.
Thank you.

35:51.153 --> 35:52.153
Thank you.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.313
What am I
thanking him for?

35:53.393 --> 35:54.553
Howard: So let's review.

35:54.633 --> 35:56.233
My life sucked,

35:56.313 --> 35:57.673
Alison dumped me,

35:57.753 --> 35:59.473
I didn't know if she'd
ever come back to me,

35:59.553 --> 36:01.473
and now this dickwad
is calling me Big Bird.

36:01.513 --> 36:04.033
106 FM, WWWW.

36:04.113 --> 36:06.153
I don't know.
Something in me just snapped.

36:06.233 --> 36:07.673
My name
is Howard Stern,

36:07.713 --> 36:09.713
and welcome to
the new morning show.

36:09.753 --> 36:11.233
And we have
a new feature for you.

36:11.313 --> 36:13.193
This is, uh,
something special.

36:13.273 --> 36:16.753
We have a traffic copter now
here at WWWW.

36:16.833 --> 36:19.993
Let's go up to Mama Look-a boo boo day
in the traffic copter.

36:20.073 --> 36:21.513
Mama, you there?

36:21.593 --> 36:22.793
Hello? Mama? Uh.

36:24.233 --> 36:25.633
Hello?

36:25.713 --> 36:28.073
Yes, hello.
This is Mama Look-a boo boo day,

36:28.153 --> 36:32.113
the only black traffic reporter
in the Detroit area,

36:32.193 --> 36:33.713
I'm proud to say.

36:33.793 --> 36:35.913
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance this morning, Mama.

36:35.993 --> 36:38.873
Tell me, uh, what's going on
in the traffic?

36:38.913 --> 36:41.553
First, a political
statement, if I may.

36:44.353 --> 36:46.913
Kill, Kill, Kill...

36:46.993 --> 36:48.193
The White Man,

36:48.273 --> 36:51.313
by Eugene
Mama Look-a boo boo day.

36:51.393 --> 36:53.793
Eugene is my pen name 'cause
I wrote this while I was in the pen.

36:53.873 --> 36:55.793
OK, here we go.

37:00.833 --> 37:04.033
Kill, kill,
kill the white man.

37:08.313 --> 37:11.353
Kill him
until he is dead.

37:13.113 --> 37:14.753
Kill the white man.

37:17.673 --> 37:19.313
Thank you.

37:25.073 --> 37:28.793
Yeah, hi. Can I speak
to Alison Stern, please?

37:28.833 --> 37:31.313
Her husband Howard.

37:31.393 --> 37:32.873
It's Howard.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.913
Hello?

37:37.993 --> 37:42.513
# There must be some
kind of way out of here #

37:42.593 --> 37:45.073
# Said the joker
to the thief #

37:46.713 --> 37:49.713
# There's
too much confusion #

37:50.953 --> 37:55.073
# I can't get no relief #

37:55.153 --> 37:57.193
# Businessmen, they'll #

37:57.273 --> 37:58.993
# They'll drink my wine #

37:59.073 --> 38:01.793
# Plowmen dig my earth... #

38:03.633 --> 38:05.553
You talk too much.

38:05.633 --> 38:07.233
And very important,

38:07.313 --> 38:09.393
I want the time
and the temperature

38:09.473 --> 38:12.673
4 times every 15 minutes,
not 3. 4.

38:12.753 --> 38:15.513
My grandmother
died last night.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.513
I spent all night with her
in the hospital.

38:20.513 --> 38:22.593
She... She
had a car accident.

38:24.273 --> 38:25.553
By the way, uh...

38:25.633 --> 38:28.273
It's 6:45. Temperature
is, uh, 58 degrees.

38:28.353 --> 38:29.753
# No reason
to get excited #

38:29.793 --> 38:31.793
Anyway, her head
went through the windshield.

38:31.873 --> 38:33.353
You know, it's funny,
but her last words...

38:33.393 --> 38:35.713
# The thief,
he kindly spoke #

38:37.033 --> 38:39.953
# There are many here
among us #

38:40.033 --> 38:41.393
I want you back
so bad...

38:41.433 --> 38:45.393
# Who feel that life
is but a joke #

38:45.473 --> 38:49.673
# But you and I,
we've been through that #

38:49.753 --> 38:51.233
# And this not our fate... #

38:51.313 --> 38:52.753
Howard: I had, like,
no listeners,

38:52.833 --> 38:54.513
and the couple of listeners
I did have

38:54.593 --> 38:56.393
Would call in and tell me
how bad I sucked

38:56.473 --> 38:57.953
on a regular basis.

38:58.033 --> 39:00.673
Although, I did manage to convince
one of them to be my weather lady.

39:00.753 --> 39:02.313
Irene...
the weather girl.

39:02.393 --> 39:03.673
Irene,
are you there?

39:03.753 --> 39:05.953
It's cold, real cold,

39:05.993 --> 39:08.153
but your ass
is gonna be plenty hot

39:08.233 --> 39:10.353
when I give you a good,
hard butt-whipping.

39:10.433 --> 39:11.633
Tongue.

39:11.713 --> 39:13.433
What do you think
about that?

39:13.513 --> 39:15.433
Turns you on, doesn't it,
you little maggot?

39:15.513 --> 39:16.513
Yeah.

39:16.593 --> 39:18.313
Irene, thank you
for the weather forecast.

39:18.393 --> 39:19.313
Shut up.

39:19.393 --> 39:20.873
We hope to hear
from you tomorrow...

39:20.913 --> 39:22.113
Give us some
more weather.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.393
Bite me, you loser.

39:32.753 --> 39:35.553
You shaved
your mustache.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.153
Jeez. Alison.

39:40.073 --> 39:41.713
It's great to see you.

39:41.793 --> 39:43.393
Al, I miss you so much.

39:43.473 --> 39:45.273
I'm feelin' so miserable
since you left.

39:45.353 --> 39:47.393
I am just so uncomfortable
in this Detroit. I'm...

39:47.473 --> 39:48.753
Howard...

39:48.833 --> 39:51.033
I'm willing to believe
you didn't sleep with that girl.

39:51.073 --> 39:54.313
OK? And I understand
you're a somewhat abnormal person

39:54.393 --> 39:56.633
with a somewhat abnormal job.
That I can accept.

39:56.713 --> 39:58.553
I deal with abnormality
every single day.

39:58.633 --> 40:00.513
I don't need everything
in my life to be normal.

40:00.553 --> 40:02.753
And on the air,
you do what you do. That's your job.

40:02.833 --> 40:06.513
But off the air,
for me to be in this marriage...

40:06.553 --> 40:09.193
I need to know
I'm the only one.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.273
And I'm not saying that
to pressure you.

40:11.353 --> 40:14.913
I'm saying it because it's
just something I know about myself.

40:14.993 --> 40:17.273
So... if you need more time
or whatever...

40:17.353 --> 40:19.793
I don't need
any more time.

40:19.833 --> 40:22.553
I am just so madly
in love with you.

40:22.633 --> 40:25.353
I don't... I don't need
anyone else in my life.

40:25.433 --> 40:27.273
I never wanted
anyone else in my life.

40:27.313 --> 40:28.913
All I want is you.

40:28.993 --> 40:31.913
I just want you
to forgive me.

40:36.193 --> 40:38.153
Thanks for coming back.

40:38.233 --> 40:39.473
Wow.

40:42.633 --> 40:45.593
Come on, you guys.
Right up here looks perfect.

40:45.673 --> 40:47.073
Howard:
Isn't Alison amazing?

40:47.153 --> 40:48.673
She's in town,
like, 2 minutes,

40:48.753 --> 40:52.673
and already she's got a job
working with a bunch of wackos.

40:52.753 --> 40:55.233
Excuse me.
Mentally challenged.

40:55.268 --> 40:57.633
Nice day, huh?

40:57.673 --> 40:59.553
What can I do
to help here?

40:59.633 --> 41:01.633
Well, I'm gonna
set up lunch...

41:01.713 --> 41:02.673
OK.

41:02.753 --> 41:05.393
And you can play frisbee
with the guys.

41:05.473 --> 41:08.233
Start again.
Here we go.

41:08.273 --> 41:10.513
Oh. I'm so sorry.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.553
Listen, what you
got to do is,

41:12.593 --> 41:14.193
you got to put
this hand up, OK?

41:14.273 --> 41:16.153
And you got to try
and catch it, OK?

41:16.193 --> 41:18.113
All right,
here we go.

41:18.193 --> 41:19.753
Ready? Here we go.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.393
I'm so sorry.

41:24.713 --> 41:26.633
You know what
we're gonna do?

41:26.713 --> 41:29.113
Just tell me that you're ready.
Are you ready?

41:29.193 --> 41:30.593
Y-Yes.

41:32.273 --> 41:33.953
Howard! Howard!

41:34.033 --> 41:34.953
Marvin.

41:35.033 --> 41:36.873
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.753
I have some
very exciting news!

41:38.833 --> 41:40.433
Oh. Are you
all right?

41:40.513 --> 41:41.553
Yeah. Yeah.

41:41.633 --> 41:42.833
That was good.

41:42.913 --> 41:45.713
You just got to wait
till somebody looks, OK?

41:45.793 --> 41:49.953
Hoo. Uh, well, we decided that
Detroit has too many rock stations,

41:50.033 --> 41:52.553
so starting tomorrow
we're starting a new format,

41:52.633 --> 41:54.593
and it'll give us
a real great edge.

41:58.313 --> 42:00.233
# Ooh ooh #

42:00.313 --> 42:03.033
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee #

42:03.113 --> 42:05.073
# Ooh doo #

42:05.153 --> 42:06.993
# Doo-doop
doo-doo-doo #

42:07.073 --> 42:09.433
# Doo doo ooh #

42:09.473 --> 42:10.473
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee... #

42:10.553 --> 42:11.953
Howdy, cowpokes.

42:12.033 --> 42:14.073
Uh, I know I shouldn't be
interrupting in the middle of a song,

42:14.153 --> 42:15.513
but I got to
tell you something.

42:15.553 --> 42:17.513
I know a lot of you out there
really love this music,

42:17.553 --> 42:18.993
but I just don't get it.

42:19.073 --> 42:20.233
Explain it to me.

42:20.313 --> 42:22.233
And maybe it's 'cause
I went to college,

42:22.313 --> 42:24.233
and I never drove a truck

42:24.313 --> 42:27.193
and had sex with
my daddy's sister, but...

42:27.233 --> 42:29.353
I guess what I'm
trying to say is, I...

42:29.433 --> 42:30.993
I don't think
I'm the man for this job.

42:31.073 --> 42:34.793
So this is your old pal
Hopalong Howie saying I quit.

42:34.873 --> 42:36.193
I... I think I quit.

42:36.233 --> 42:38.553
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee #

42:38.633 --> 42:41.233
# Ooh doo #

42:41.273 --> 42:43.273
# Doo-doop
doo-doo-doo #

42:43.313 --> 42:45.513
# Doo doo ooh #

42:45.593 --> 42:47.953
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
dee dee #

42:48.033 --> 42:49.313
# Oh #

42:49.433 --> 42:51.353
# Dee dee dee #

42:53.273 --> 42:54.953
What?

42:55.033 --> 42:56.113
Nothing.

43:07.233 --> 43:08.633
What is it?

43:08.673 --> 43:10.433
I feel like
such a loser.

43:10.513 --> 43:13.233
It's not your fault.
It was a lame station.

43:13.273 --> 43:14.673
Yeah, it was my fault.

43:14.713 --> 43:16.913
You can't blame a radio station.
It's my screwup.

43:16.993 --> 43:18.273
In what way?

43:18.313 --> 43:20.273
In a way that I gotta
figure out what I'm gonna be.

43:20.313 --> 43:22.313
I mean, I don't want to be
one of these disc jockeys

43:22.353 --> 43:25.553
that runs around the country, you know,
looking for work all the time.

43:25.633 --> 43:27.993
I don't want to end up like that.
It's so sad.

43:28.073 --> 43:30.353
It's so apparent to me now
what I should be doing.

43:30.393 --> 43:32.153
I should be talking
about my personal life.

43:32.233 --> 43:34.193
I've got to get intimate.

43:34.233 --> 43:36.473
And every time I feel like
I shouldn't say something,

43:36.553 --> 43:38.593
maybe I should just say it,
just blurt it out, you know?

43:38.673 --> 43:41.393
I just got to
let things fly.

43:41.473 --> 43:43.433
I got to go all the way.

43:43.513 --> 43:45.913
You didn't go
all the way before?

43:45.993 --> 43:47.233
No. I mean...

43:47.313 --> 43:49.673
No. A lot of times,
I'm just holding back.

43:52.633 --> 43:55.553
Then I guess you should
go all the way.

43:57.673 --> 43:59.113
Hold the sign
nice and low.

43:59.153 --> 44:00.793
With a big smile...
Very sexy...

44:00.873 --> 44:02.193
This is about Howard
coming to Washington.

44:02.273 --> 44:03.433
What's going on here?

44:03.553 --> 44:04.753
Um, we're
shooting a movie.

44:04.793 --> 44:06.033
Hey,
you got a permit?

44:06.113 --> 44:07.353
Uh, no, we don't
have a permit,

44:07.433 --> 44:08.953
but this is,
like, one line,

44:08.993 --> 44:10.793
and we'll be done with them in a second
and we'll be out of your way.

44:10.833 --> 44:12.273
You can't be there, then.
You're blocking the median.

44:12.353 --> 44:13.673
Come on, you're
gonna have to move.

44:13.753 --> 44:15.433
Um, this if for
the Howard Stern movie.

44:15.513 --> 44:17.193
Wait a minute.
You said Howard Stern?

44:17.273 --> 44:18.433
Yeah.
This is his movie.

44:18.553 --> 44:19.593
Is Howard here?

44:19.673 --> 44:21.233
No, he's not here today,
not in this scene,

44:21.313 --> 44:22.393
but this is his movie.

44:22.473 --> 44:24.033
Come on.
You got to move.

44:24.113 --> 44:25.793
Tsk. Give us a break.
It'll take a second.

44:25.873 --> 44:27.113
Just look right
at the camera,

44:27.193 --> 44:28.433
and say, "Howard
comes to Washington."

44:28.473 --> 44:29.753
Howard comes
to Washington.

44:29.833 --> 44:30.993
Hey, let's go!
Come on!

44:31.073 --> 44:33.033
Howard's, like,
a big fan of the cops.

44:33.113 --> 44:34.313
He loves you guys.

44:34.393 --> 44:35.793
We could have
been done by now.

44:35.873 --> 44:37.073
Guess what.
You are done.

44:37.153 --> 44:40.473
Howard: I was hired by
an FM rock station, DC 101,

44:40.593 --> 44:43.033
and that's when I met
the other woman in my life.

44:43.113 --> 44:44.553
Howard?

44:44.633 --> 44:47.193
Hi. I'm Robin Quivers,
your newswoman.

44:47.273 --> 44:50.073
Oh. Oh, I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

44:50.153 --> 44:51.153
It's great to meet you.

44:51.233 --> 44:52.153
Same here.

44:52.233 --> 44:53.833
Yeah, this is
gonna be great.

44:53.913 --> 44:57.153
OK, I'm just gonna go over here
and work on my script.

44:57.233 --> 44:59.233
We're almost set.

44:59.313 --> 45:00.473
Ooh.

45:04.033 --> 45:05.953
Ahem.

45:05.993 --> 45:09.073
DC 101. Good morning.
This is Howard Stern.

45:09.153 --> 45:10.713
Welcome to the show.

45:10.793 --> 45:12.993
I have a confession
to make.

45:13.073 --> 45:15.393
I did not get, uh,
laid last night.

45:15.433 --> 45:18.753
In fact, I haven't gotten laid
in a really long time.

45:18.833 --> 45:21.073
Now, give me a call
here at DC 101

45:21.153 --> 45:23.033
if you have
the same kind of problem.

45:23.113 --> 45:24.033
Having trouble
with your woman?

45:24.113 --> 45:25.753
Give me a call.
I'll help you out.

45:25.833 --> 45:27.713
Let me introduce,
over here to my right,

45:27.793 --> 45:31.473
my beautiful new newswoman
Robin Quivers, who looks so beautiful,

45:31.513 --> 45:34.593
I'm sure she doesn't have
any of these sexual problems.

45:34.673 --> 45:38.553
But I must tell you,
my life is, um, very odd.

45:38.593 --> 45:40.553
I get hornier
and hornier.

45:40.593 --> 45:43.513
My wife, she comes home from work,
she goes to sleep.

45:43.553 --> 45:45.513
The whole week goes by,
she never gets horny.

45:45.593 --> 45:47.873
Robin, as a woman,
what is it?

45:47.953 --> 45:49.953
Do women get horny?

45:55.673 --> 45:57.913
Sometimes.

45:57.993 --> 46:00.073
Why is he talking
to his newsperson?

46:00.153 --> 46:01.553
I'll have him stop.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.153
What about you
specifically, though?

46:03.233 --> 46:06.833
When is the last time
that you were with a man...

46:06.913 --> 46:07.993
sexually?

46:09.913 --> 46:11.433
About a year.

46:11.513 --> 46:13.193
You're serious?

46:13.273 --> 46:14.473
- A year?
- Yeah.

46:14.553 --> 46:15.833
A year,
ladies and gentlemen.

46:15.913 --> 46:17.153
Someone more pathetic
than me.

46:17.233 --> 46:18.913
This is good. This is good.
We're getting somewhere.

46:18.993 --> 46:20.073
This is a good
discussion.

46:20.153 --> 46:22.673
Uh, you know,
I bought a book,

46:22.753 --> 46:24.233
"How to Score with Babes,"

46:24.313 --> 46:25.713
and listen
to what it says.

46:25.793 --> 46:26.993
I think
it's rather revealing.

46:27.033 --> 46:29.353
"When attempting
to score with a babe,

46:29.433 --> 46:31.353
"make sure to wear
tight pants.

46:31.433 --> 46:34.513
"If necessary, stuff
a semirigid, large object

46:34.593 --> 46:35.793
"into your pants

46:35.873 --> 46:38.273
to create the appearance
of having a large penis."

46:38.313 --> 46:40.193
Women like large penis.

46:40.273 --> 46:42.513
Did he say "penis"?

46:42.593 --> 46:44.073
I know about this stuff.

46:44.153 --> 46:46.433
I have no bulge in my crotch.
I have a small penis.

46:46.513 --> 46:48.393
And I've never told
anyone this before...

46:48.473 --> 46:50.113
And I don't think
you should start now.

46:50.153 --> 46:52.513
Well, I've done it.
Now the cat's out of the bag.

46:52.593 --> 46:54.153
But this guy
wrote a good book.

46:54.233 --> 46:56.393
The author has slept
with over 16,000 women,

46:56.473 --> 46:57.953
and, uh,
take it from him.

46:58.033 --> 47:00.513
He says
wear tight pants.

47:00.593 --> 47:03.153
If he slept
with 16,000 women,

47:03.233 --> 47:05.993
he wouldn't have time
to put on pants.

47:06.073 --> 47:08.833
That is true, too.
I didn't consider that.

47:08.953 --> 47:10.153
Why don't you
give me a call at DC 101

47:10.273 --> 47:12.153
if you want
to talk about this.

47:12.273 --> 47:14.993
We'll be back
right after these words.

47:16.233 --> 47:17.553
You're a genius.

47:17.633 --> 47:18.833
That was great.

47:18.913 --> 47:20.233
That was interesting.

47:20.353 --> 47:22.313
Didn't that feel good?
That was great.

47:22.433 --> 47:24.753
You say
whatever you want.

47:24.833 --> 47:27.193
You have carte blanche.

47:27.273 --> 47:30.193
You and Robin must not talk
to each other on the air.

47:30.273 --> 47:31.993
And don't sing along
with the music.

47:32.073 --> 47:33.673
And you know
what else you could do?

47:33.793 --> 47:35.993
I'd like you to memorize
the names of the local high schools.

47:36.073 --> 47:37.833
And don't criticize
Washington.

47:37.913 --> 47:39.513
It's not good for ratings.

47:39.633 --> 47:42.873
Now, if you'll excuse us, we'd like
to talk to Robin alone for a second.

47:42.993 --> 47:44.273
Wait. I wanted...

47:44.353 --> 47:45.753
You know what I want you
to do for me,

47:45.833 --> 47:47.633
is to make up a grid
of all your comedy bits

47:47.713 --> 47:49.113
and the corresponding
days of the week,

47:49.193 --> 47:51.433
so that I'll know on which day
you'll be doing which bit.

47:51.553 --> 47:54.753
I told you I work spontaneously.
I think that I...

48:00.473 --> 48:02.513
Robin...
don't encourage him.

48:02.593 --> 48:04.553
He's better
when he's toned down.

48:04.633 --> 48:08.713
We need you to be
a friend here, Robin.

48:08.833 --> 48:10.993
I'll see
what I can do.

48:11.073 --> 48:12.873
Great.

48:12.953 --> 48:14.233
Appreciate it,
Robin.

48:14.313 --> 48:15.393
- OK.
- Thanks.

48:17.473 --> 48:19.353
I think we should
separate them.

48:19.473 --> 48:22.353
Orioles over the Red Sox
3-2 last night,

48:22.473 --> 48:24.353
extending the Os'
winning streak to 7.

48:24.473 --> 48:26.353
And finally,
today is Memorial Day.

48:26.473 --> 48:29.873
Sunny skies and warm temperatures
for veterans marching in parades

48:29.993 --> 48:31.353
across the metropolitan area.

48:31.473 --> 48:34.393
Highs today in the 70s.
It's 58 degrees...

48:34.473 --> 48:37.393
You know, Robin, let me
interrupt for a second.

48:37.473 --> 48:39.393
I'm glad you brought up
Memorial Day.

48:39.473 --> 48:41.393
I was in Vietnam.
I'd like to talk to you about it.

48:41.473 --> 48:43.393
I had 11 kills
in Vietnam,

48:43.473 --> 48:46.873
and I'm telling you,
I really should've had more.

48:46.993 --> 48:48.873
Officially, I should've
had more kills.

48:48.993 --> 48:50.873
Let me tell you
what I'm talking about.

48:50.993 --> 48:52.913
I was in a gook village,
and I come upon a schoolhouse.

48:52.993 --> 48:54.753
So I grab one of
my grenades off my belt,

48:54.873 --> 48:56.593
and I throw it right
into the schoolhouse.

48:56.713 --> 48:58.873
And I blow up
the whole damn thing.

48:58.953 --> 49:00.993
So I'm out there
counting all the bodies.

49:01.113 --> 49:03.153
You threw a grenade
into a school?

49:03.273 --> 49:05.193
That's exactly
what I'm telling you.

49:05.273 --> 49:06.993
I must've killed, like,
200 kids.

49:07.113 --> 49:09.713
My dickhead lieutenant
comes up to me, and he says,

49:09.833 --> 49:12.673
"Stern, those are little kids.
That counts as one person."

49:12.753 --> 49:14.673
Howard, I was
in the military.

49:14.753 --> 49:17.153
I was a captain in the Air Force.
What were you?

49:17.273 --> 49:18.633
What was I?

49:18.753 --> 49:20.233
Yeah, what were you?

49:20.353 --> 49:22.313
- What were you again?
- I was a captain.

49:22.393 --> 49:24.313
That's what I was.
I was a captain.

49:24.393 --> 49:25.833
And what were you in?

49:25.913 --> 49:27.353
I was in Vietnam.

49:27.473 --> 49:29.113
Ohh! Army? Navy?

49:29.193 --> 49:30.113
In the Army.

49:30.193 --> 49:32.153
Did you have a division?

49:32.193 --> 49:33.153
103rd.

49:33.193 --> 49:34.153
103rd what?

49:34.193 --> 49:35.633
I was in the 103rd...

49:35.753 --> 49:37.153
I don't know
what I was in, Robin,

49:37.193 --> 49:39.233
But I'm saying I was
in the 103rd.

49:39.313 --> 49:41.233
And the point
of this whole thing

49:41.313 --> 49:44.073
is that I think a kill
is a kill is a kill,

49:44.153 --> 49:46.593
and killing a kid should be
just as good as killing an adult.

49:46.673 --> 49:51.233
Well, I suppose even if you're killing
children, they should count them.

49:51.313 --> 49:54.313
I got some music
for you now at DC 101.

49:55.433 --> 49:56.513
Ha ha!

49:57.913 --> 49:59.553
You're not even old enough
to have been in Vietnam.

49:59.673 --> 50:00.553
Duh.

50:02.233 --> 50:04.593
I couldn't sit there
and not say something.

50:04.713 --> 50:07.113
I knew they had told me
not to talk.

50:07.153 --> 50:09.593
I knew I was going to get
in trouble if I did.

50:09.713 --> 50:11.593
But he was really
onto something,

50:11.713 --> 50:15.593
and I knew that there was
something going on there...

50:15.713 --> 50:18.113
and I just went for it.

50:20.713 --> 50:23.153
Well, this just came
from the FCC.

50:23.273 --> 50:25.673
Did you say "testicles"
on the air?

50:25.713 --> 50:26.673
Wait a second.

50:26.793 --> 50:28.673
Screw the FCC.
We just lost Muffler Man.

50:28.713 --> 50:30.673
Hold on. We have
a real problem here.

50:30.713 --> 50:32.153
I'm just trying
to get ratings.

50:32.273 --> 50:33.593
I am just trying
to run a radio station.

50:33.713 --> 50:35.273
I understand that,
and I'm telling you

50:35.353 --> 50:37.193
that the commercial sponsors
are there once you get the ratings.

50:37.273 --> 50:38.273
There's a big problem.

50:38.353 --> 50:40.033
They're gonna be
lining up 10 in a row.

50:40.113 --> 50:42.233
You listen to me,
you stupid asshole.

50:42.353 --> 50:45.033
Radio is a business, and
you just cost us $40,000.

50:45.113 --> 50:48.753
Wait a second. If I do a lame show,
it's never gonna take off.

50:48.833 --> 50:50.753
I'm calm.
I am perfectly calm.

50:50.833 --> 50:53.593
D.C. Carpet canceled
because of him.

50:53.713 --> 50:55.553
Well, I've reached
my limit.

50:55.633 --> 50:57.833
I don't know about you,
but my back is against the wall.

50:57.913 --> 50:59.153
Will everyone
just sit down?

50:59.233 --> 51:00.353
I just want to say
one thing.

51:00.473 --> 51:01.873
I really think this show's
starting to take off.

51:01.913 --> 51:03.353
There's a buzz
on the street about it.

51:03.473 --> 51:05.353
If we just give it a chance,
if we just take some time with it,

51:05.473 --> 51:07.473
I think everything's
gonna be OK.

51:07.553 --> 51:09.473
Don't push
your luck, Howard.

51:09.553 --> 51:12.273
Robin Leach: The countdown to our "Live
Life Like a Millionaire Sweepstakes"

51:12.353 --> 51:13.433
is getting closer.

51:13.513 --> 51:15.353
We're going to
have winners take...

51:15.393 --> 51:16.353
Hey!

51:16.393 --> 51:17.433
Hi, honey.

51:17.513 --> 51:19.913
Robin Leach says we
should move to Antigua.

51:19.993 --> 51:22.393
Oh, yeah?
Come on, hurry up.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.273
Snap to it.
I'm ovulating.

51:24.393 --> 51:27.273
I'm in the middle of
important show research.

51:27.393 --> 51:30.273
Howard, seriously,
come on.

51:30.393 --> 51:32.273
You know what?
You're getting baby fever here.

51:32.393 --> 51:33.793
And you know, maybe
it's a little premature.

51:33.873 --> 51:35.793
I'm about 3 days away from being fired,
the way I figure it.

51:35.873 --> 51:37.793
And do you want
to know something?

51:37.873 --> 51:39.313
You got to think about
the economics of this.

51:39.393 --> 51:41.313
You're gonna be the best morning man
in the history of radio.

51:41.393 --> 51:42.953
At any minute, you're
gonna be number one.

51:43.073 --> 51:44.313
- Is that so?
- Yeah! Strip!

51:44.393 --> 51:45.633
Let me tell you something.
Look at yourself.

51:45.713 --> 51:47.153
You're completely on fire
about having a baby.

51:47.233 --> 51:49.153
You don't understand.
I'm not a piece of meat.

51:49.233 --> 51:50.873
I mean,
I have to be romanced.

51:50.993 --> 51:52.793
Oh, yeah. Please.

51:52.873 --> 51:55.793
Ooh, look at that bra.
Where did you get that?

51:55.873 --> 51:57.033
You like this?

51:57.153 --> 51:58.553
OK. That's it.
That's it!

51:58.633 --> 52:00.473
I am making a baby!

52:00.553 --> 52:02.593
It's baby time!
I'm ready to give you a baby.

52:02.713 --> 52:03.633
Thank you.

52:03.713 --> 52:04.633
Hold on.

52:07.353 --> 52:08.753
OK. Now I'm hot.

52:08.833 --> 52:10.273
Now I actually
want to have sex.

52:10.353 --> 52:11.953
I didn't before
and now I do.

52:12.073 --> 52:13.393
Announcer On TV:
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous...

52:14.473 --> 52:15.913
Robin, watch this.

52:20.473 --> 52:21.713
What am I doing?

52:21.793 --> 52:23.553
Uh, having a seizure?

52:23.633 --> 52:25.593
No, that's not a seizure.
That's me dancing

52:25.633 --> 52:28.753
because I'm happy
'cause I got laid last night.

52:28.833 --> 52:30.073
- Oh!
- Yeah, I really did.

52:30.193 --> 52:32.073
In fact,
it was not for lust.

52:32.193 --> 52:33.753
It was 'cause I was
making a kid.

52:33.833 --> 52:35.753
- Oh.
- In fact, my wife's eggs are very old.

52:35.833 --> 52:37.633
They're very, you know,
she's getting older.

52:37.713 --> 52:39.113
But my sperm
is like supersperm,

52:39.233 --> 52:41.353
so I'm pretty sure everything
was delivered in one shot.

52:41.473 --> 52:43.353
Oh, yeah.
Your sperm are fine.

52:43.473 --> 52:45.353
My sperm are fantastic.
I'm fantastic.

52:45.473 --> 52:47.873
I'm in a good mood.
Let's take some phone calls

52:47.913 --> 52:49.353
and see what's doing
out there.

52:49.473 --> 52:50.873
- OK.
- Hi, you're on the air.

52:50.953 --> 52:52.433
Woman Caller: Hi,
is this Howard Stern?

52:52.513 --> 52:53.593
This is Howard.

52:53.673 --> 52:55.113
Oh, whoa.
Anyway, I was calling

52:55.193 --> 52:56.953
because I have
a really big problem.

52:57.033 --> 52:58.153
What's your problem?

52:58.233 --> 52:59.713
Well, every morning
I lie in bed,

52:59.833 --> 53:01.273
and the only thing
I can do is think of you.

53:01.353 --> 53:03.953
Oh, really? Well, let's see if we
can't help you with your problem.

53:04.033 --> 53:05.273
What do you look like?

53:05.353 --> 53:08.913
Well, I've got blond hair,
and I've got blue eyes,

53:08.993 --> 53:12.433
and my measurements
are about 38-24-34.

53:12.513 --> 53:15.273
Some people tell me I look
a lot like Farrah Fawcett.

53:15.353 --> 53:17.393
I can help you.
Robin, I can help this girl.

53:17.513 --> 53:19.913
You know, we have the most
beautiful audience.

53:19.953 --> 53:22.473
We certainly do. We're
very fortunate that way.

53:22.513 --> 53:23.913
You know what we're gonna do
to solve your problem?

53:23.953 --> 53:25.953
I'm gonna have sex with you
right now over the radio.

53:25.993 --> 53:27.393
Caller:
How are we gonna do that?

53:27.513 --> 53:29.753
Very simple.
I've thought this through, Robin.

53:29.793 --> 53:32.393
First of all, what kind of radio
are you listening to us on?

53:32.513 --> 53:35.393
You have a transistor radio, or you
have one of those big sound systems?

53:35.513 --> 53:36.953
Caller: I have
one of those big sound systems.

53:37.033 --> 53:38.073
Good. OK.

53:38.193 --> 53:39.913
Could you turn the treble
all the way down

53:39.993 --> 53:41.193
and put the bass
all the way up?

53:42.713 --> 53:45.553
OK. The treble's down,
and the bass is up.

53:45.673 --> 53:48.033
Howard: Take your speaker...
You got a big speaker?

53:48.153 --> 53:48.953
Caller: Yes, I do.

53:49.033 --> 53:50.473
Lay it flat
on the floor.

53:50.513 --> 53:53.233
And I want you to sort
of straddle the speaker.

53:53.313 --> 53:54.713
- Howard!
- Caller: Do what?

53:54.793 --> 53:57.593
A woman cannot be aroused
in that way.

53:57.673 --> 53:59.913
Howard: No. This is really wrong, Robin.
You're absolutely wrong.

53:59.993 --> 54:01.953
In fact, my father
was a radio engineer,

54:01.993 --> 54:04.113
and he proved
this theory years ago.

54:04.193 --> 54:05.673
You've got to believe.

54:05.753 --> 54:09.113
Now, what I need you to do is put
your private area over the woofer.

54:09.193 --> 54:10.433
Caller: I can't believe you're
really making me to do this.

54:10.513 --> 54:11.993
Howard: Come on, do it.

54:12.033 --> 54:14.393
Right up against it
so you can feel me.

54:17.873 --> 54:18.873
I'm on.

54:18.913 --> 54:20.993
Robin: Oh, I have
to ask her a question.

54:21.073 --> 54:25.193
What kind of a woman are you
to have sex this way on the radio?

54:25.273 --> 54:26.953
Don't answer that question.
Bad question.

54:27.033 --> 54:28.793
You're gonna ruin
this woman's mood.

54:28.873 --> 54:30.793
She might start
second-guessing.

54:30.873 --> 54:32.073
Are you ready
to have sex?

54:32.153 --> 54:33.553
Caller, Giggling:
Oh, my God.

54:37.473 --> 54:39.593
Ooh!

54:41.193 --> 54:42.233
Oohh!

54:42.313 --> 54:44.873
Ooh. It kinda tingles.

54:44.953 --> 54:47.433
See? It tingles.
She likes it.

54:47.513 --> 54:48.433
Yeah, sure.

54:52.433 --> 54:54.913
Ohh! Oh...

54:57.713 --> 54:59.073
She's full of it.

55:01.553 --> 55:02.913
Aahh!

55:02.993 --> 55:06.913
Ohh! Oh, God! Oh!

55:06.953 --> 55:08.313
Listen to her.
She's going wild.

55:08.353 --> 55:09.993
You got me moaning.

55:24.993 --> 55:25.913
Oh, my goodness.

55:28.113 --> 55:30.913
Ohhh!

55:32.673 --> 55:34.873
This is the best sex
I ever had.

55:34.953 --> 55:36.913
Ooh! Standing ovation.
Thank you.

55:36.953 --> 55:38.073
- Oh, boy.
- Thank you.

55:38.153 --> 55:39.713
Robin: Take your bows.

55:40.833 --> 55:43.273
A woman on the air
had an orgasm.

55:43.353 --> 55:44.753
Have you lost your mind?

55:44.833 --> 55:46.273
But you got to admit,
it was a funny bit.

55:46.353 --> 55:47.793
The audience loved
that stuff.

55:47.833 --> 55:49.273
We just lost Stereo City.

55:49.353 --> 55:51.593
This is not Muffler Man.
This is Stereo fucking City.

55:51.633 --> 55:53.433
Dee Dee, you know
there's gonna be other sponsors.

55:53.513 --> 55:56.393
No, there's not, Howard, 'cause
your career is over. You're finished.

55:56.433 --> 55:58.233
Come on!
How can you say that?

55:58.313 --> 55:59.953
Dee Dee,
I don't believe it.

56:00.033 --> 56:02.033
He's up.

56:02.113 --> 56:03.153
He's up?

56:03.233 --> 56:05.233
In the new ratings book,
he's up... 2 points.

56:05.313 --> 56:06.833
Howard:
I love you.

56:06.913 --> 56:09.353
2 full points,
and Pizza Shack called.

56:09.433 --> 56:11.353
They want to buy time
on the Stern show.

56:11.433 --> 56:13.353
I go to Pizza Shack
all the time. Great.

56:13.433 --> 56:15.353
This is a great time
to talk

56:15.433 --> 56:16.873
about putting some money
into the show.

56:16.953 --> 56:18.593
I know a guy,
he does voices, he does comedy.

56:18.673 --> 56:21.113
Absolutely not.
This could be a fluke.

56:21.193 --> 56:24.473
I guarantee you we'll go up 2 full
rating points if you hire this guy.

56:24.553 --> 56:26.073
This guy
must be hot.

56:26.153 --> 56:28.073
This guy is
total personality.

56:28.153 --> 56:29.633
He's electric.

56:39.673 --> 56:42.393
Hey, Rick.
How's tricks, buddy?

56:42.473 --> 56:43.913
I've been coughing all day.

56:43.953 --> 56:47.393
I feel like I'm about
to cough up a lung.

56:47.473 --> 56:50.633
Blecch!

56:50.713 --> 56:52.273
Waaa!

56:52.353 --> 56:55.158
Both:
Oh, no! It's Lucy!

56:55.193 --> 56:57.113
# You got me so I can't
sleep at night #

56:57.193 --> 57:00.633
# Girl,
you really got me now #

57:00.673 --> 57:03.273
# You got me so I don't know
where I'm going #

57:03.353 --> 57:04.953
Howard:
Thank you very much.

57:05.033 --> 57:06.953
# Yeah, you really
got me now #

57:07.033 --> 57:09.473
# You got me so
I can't sleep at night #

57:09.553 --> 57:12.593
# You really got me,
You really got me... #

57:12.673 --> 57:14.873
Howard: Once the three of us
were together, everything felt right.

57:14.913 --> 57:16.873
I mean, things really
started to take off.

57:16.953 --> 57:19.633
It was then that I made
a startling discovery.

57:19.713 --> 57:23.033
She's a beautiful girl. You're telling
me this beautiful woman is a lesbian?

57:23.113 --> 57:25.353
Howard: Lesbians
equal ratings.

57:25.393 --> 57:26.993
Now let me say something.

57:27.073 --> 57:28.713
I am the hero
of the lesbian community,

57:28.793 --> 57:29.873
am I not, Robin?

57:29.953 --> 57:31.033
I guess you are.

57:31.113 --> 57:32.233
I absolutely am.

57:32.353 --> 57:34.033
All right. Now,
let's get into it.

57:34.113 --> 57:38.193
Julie, I want you to tell us
about your first lesbianic experience.

57:38.273 --> 57:39.393
OK.

57:39.473 --> 57:41.873
Tell me about the secret world
of lesbian sex.

57:41.953 --> 57:43.873
Well, Howard, I was 18.

57:43.953 --> 57:45.393
Oh, you were so young.

57:45.473 --> 57:47.913
Right. And I was working
at a summer camp.

57:47.953 --> 57:48.913
Yes?

57:48.953 --> 57:51.233
And I was lying
in my bunk,

57:51.273 --> 57:53.393
and the camp director's wife
walked in.

57:53.473 --> 57:54.873
Ooh, now, that's hot.

57:54.953 --> 57:57.073
Uh, everyone was asleep,

57:57.153 --> 57:58.913
and I'm lying
in my bunk,

57:58.993 --> 58:00.393
and she sees me
looking at her.

58:00.473 --> 58:01.913
Howard: And then
what happens?

58:01.993 --> 58:04.393
She, like, signals
for me to go with her.

58:04.473 --> 58:05.913
What are you sleeping in?

58:05.993 --> 58:07.433
'Cause this is
what I picture.

58:07.473 --> 58:09.433
Little cotton panties,
a tight little undershirt.

58:09.473 --> 58:11.633
No. I'm wearing, like,
little baby-doll pajamas.

58:11.713 --> 58:13.833
Oh, you tease.

58:13.873 --> 58:16.833
So then she takes me
into this tent.

58:16.873 --> 58:19.873
When you walk in, lesbians
all over the place, right?

58:19.913 --> 58:22.513
I mean, a whole lesbian
sex festival, right?

58:22.593 --> 58:24.873
Oh, you know it, Howard.

58:24.953 --> 58:25.913
Man: Howard?

58:25.953 --> 58:26.913
Ohh!

58:26.953 --> 58:27.913
Howard?

58:27.953 --> 58:30.433
Alison on line 3.
It is important.

58:30.513 --> 58:32.753
Do you believe this, in the middle
of Lesbian Dating Game,

58:32.793 --> 58:34.233
my wife calls in?

58:34.313 --> 58:36.193
Robin:
Maybe she wants to play.

58:36.273 --> 58:38.233
Honey, you want to play?
You want a date with Julie?

58:38.273 --> 58:39.713
Alison: Am I on the air?

58:39.793 --> 58:41.233
Yes, honey, of course
you're on the air.

58:41.273 --> 58:43.233
I told them I wanted
to talk to you off the air.

58:43.273 --> 58:46.233
But, honey, you're in the middle of
interrupting a beautiful, sexy moment.

58:46.273 --> 58:48.393
You've got to tell everyone. My audience
wants to know why you're interrupting.

58:48.473 --> 58:49.753
Don't you want to know,
Robin?

58:49.833 --> 58:51.233
I think we deserve to.

58:51.313 --> 58:54.953
Yes, honey... Uh-oh, Al?
I think she's gone.

58:55.033 --> 58:56.913
Alison: No. I'm pregnant.

58:56.953 --> 58:58.393
What?

58:58.473 --> 59:00.393
Alison: I'm pregnant.

59:00.473 --> 59:03.393
Robin: Congratulations,
Howard.

59:03.473 --> 59:07.233
It's my supersperm. I knew
my supersperm would do it, Robin.

59:07.313 --> 59:08.313
You're so blessed.

59:08.353 --> 59:09.673
Julie says we're blessed,
honey,

59:09.753 --> 59:11.193
and Julie would know
these things.

59:11.273 --> 59:13.233
Alison: Well, I appreciate her support.
Can we talk privately now?

59:13.313 --> 59:14.473
Absolutely, sweetheart.

59:14.553 --> 59:15.833
Wait a minute. Does she
know what she's gonna have?

59:15.913 --> 59:17.113
Is it gonna be a lesbian?

59:17.193 --> 59:19.033
Oh, please, Robin!
You've gone too far.

59:19.113 --> 59:22.233
No offense, Julie.
Please, I don't need this aggravation.

59:22.273 --> 59:25.313
We're gonna take a break. We'll get back
to making out with the lesbians

59:25.353 --> 59:26.833
right after these words.

59:28.233 --> 59:29.673
- Hi.
- Alison: Hey.

59:29.713 --> 59:30.873
I can't believe it.

59:30.953 --> 59:32.353
I can't believe you made me
do that on the air.

59:32.433 --> 59:33.873
It's so exciting.
Did you call your mother?

59:33.953 --> 59:35.353
I called, I called.
I feel so different.

59:35.433 --> 59:36.353
I know.

59:36.433 --> 59:37.873
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

59:37.953 --> 59:39.353
I'm flipping
out, too.

59:39.433 --> 59:40.873
I'm somebody's
father.

59:40.953 --> 59:42.713
Oh, my God!

59:43.873 --> 59:46.313
Reporter:
Love him or hate him,

59:46.393 --> 59:47.673
unconventional
disc jockey Howard Stern

59:47.793 --> 59:49.673
jumped to the top
of the ratings today,

59:49.793 --> 59:51.753
making him number one
in greater Washington.

59:51.833 --> 59:54.793
Howard On TV: I took a dump of a
radio station and returned it to glory.

59:54.873 --> 59:56.833
Howard In Living Room:
I look like Hitler.

59:56.873 --> 59:58.833
Howard, Narrating:
I was thrilled, totally overjoyed.

59:58.913 --> 01:00:01.313
I mean, we were gonna have
our first child,

01:00:01.393 --> 01:00:03.833
and 6 weeks later,
the new ratings came out.

01:00:03.913 --> 01:00:06.353
We destroyed every other
station in the market.

01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:07.833
My life was perfect.

01:00:07.913 --> 01:00:09.833
I'm gonna grab
this guy's hat,

01:00:09.913 --> 01:00:11.353
if they show it.

01:00:15.353 --> 01:00:17.273
Howard On TV:
I'll tell you another thing...

01:00:17.353 --> 01:00:18.793
Look, watch this.

01:00:18.833 --> 01:00:20.273
You're gonna miss it.

01:00:20.353 --> 01:00:21.273
Come here.

01:00:21.353 --> 01:00:23.753
Howard On TV:
I am Officer Howie,

01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:27.113
and there's a new law in town.
We're taking it over.

01:00:28.353 --> 01:00:29.273
Alison: How!

01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:30.793
I love you.

01:00:32.873 --> 01:00:34.793
Al, you OK?

01:00:34.873 --> 01:00:38.113
I think
something's wrong.

01:00:38.193 --> 01:00:40.633
Even if I'd put you
in the hospital

01:00:40.753 --> 01:00:43.153
and I pumped you full
of every medication possible,

01:00:43.193 --> 01:00:45.713
you still would've lost
the pregnancy.

01:00:57.753 --> 01:01:00.673
Your body rejected
what was going on.

01:01:00.753 --> 01:01:03.673
And that's so healthy.
It's such a good way to look at it.

01:01:03.753 --> 01:01:06.673
And in a couple of months,
we're gonna try to have a baby again,

01:01:06.753 --> 01:01:08.153
and everything's
gonna go great.

01:01:08.233 --> 01:01:11.153
You're gonna be totally confident
that everything's going good

01:01:11.233 --> 01:01:13.273
because you know your
body would reject it

01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:15.273
if it wasn't going
right... you know?

01:01:18.393 --> 01:01:20.273
I have to tell my parents.

01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:24.273
Not really.
We don't have to tell your parents.

01:01:24.393 --> 01:01:26.793
You know
what you could do?

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:30.273
I didn't want
to tell you this,

01:01:30.393 --> 01:01:32.793
but I took a polaroid
of the toilet.

01:01:32.873 --> 01:01:35.793
And we can just mail them
a picture of that,

01:01:35.873 --> 01:01:37.793
and they can walk
around Florida, you know,

01:01:37.873 --> 01:01:39.273
and say it was
our grandchild,

01:01:39.393 --> 01:01:41.313
and your mother
will be so happy.

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:43.313
She just wants pictures
to show her friends.

01:01:43.393 --> 01:01:44.793
- No.
- You know that.

01:01:44.873 --> 01:01:47.313
She just wants to be like all
the other yentas who walk around.

01:01:47.393 --> 01:01:51.313
You know, we could name the baby
and everything. Clumpy... Clumpy Stern.

01:01:51.393 --> 01:01:55.313
She could walk around with your father
and little Clumpy pictures.

01:01:56.673 --> 01:01:58.633
Chorus, On Tape:
# All the weather #

01:01:58.713 --> 01:02:00.993
# Now here's God #

01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:01.993
Your Holiness.

01:02:02.033 --> 01:02:03.313
Howard As God:
Hello, Howard.

01:02:03.433 --> 01:02:04.833
There you are.

01:02:04.873 --> 01:02:06.833
I see your wife
had a miscarriage.

01:02:06.873 --> 01:02:08.313
Aw, don't bring
that up, God.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:09.833
Please, that's way
too personal.

01:02:09.873 --> 01:02:13.313
You tried to have a baby,
and you failed.

01:02:13.433 --> 01:02:14.313
Oh, man!

01:02:14.433 --> 01:02:16.833
Now the baby is with me!

01:02:16.913 --> 01:02:18.313
This is crazy.

01:02:18.433 --> 01:02:20.353
Boy, what a loser you are.

01:02:20.433 --> 01:02:23.353
Wow! He's getting awfully
personal this morning.

01:02:23.433 --> 01:02:25.833
Hey, God, me and my wife
are trying to have another baby.

01:02:25.913 --> 01:02:28.073
A real man would have done it
right the first time.

01:02:28.193 --> 01:02:29.593
Oh, for God's sake.

01:02:29.673 --> 01:02:32.593
It'll be pleasant today. Rain tomorrow.

01:02:32.673 --> 01:02:34.073
That's my kid up there.

01:02:34.193 --> 01:02:37.633
This is God with the weather
on DC 101.

01:02:37.673 --> 01:02:38.833
You're all wrong, God.

01:02:38.913 --> 01:02:40.793
You're completely
out of line this morning.

01:02:40.873 --> 01:02:43.273
I don't think we should be
talking about this.

01:02:43.353 --> 01:02:46.633
I went to the doctor with my wife,
and it was an awful experience,

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:49.113
because the doctor walks out,
and there's the kid,

01:02:49.193 --> 01:02:50.273
your beautiful child,

01:02:50.353 --> 01:02:52.633
and he's no bigger than
the size of an aspirin.

01:02:52.753 --> 01:02:55.153
Howie Jr., no bigger
than the size of an aspirin.

01:02:55.193 --> 01:02:56.633
Robin: Was it a boy?

01:02:56.753 --> 01:02:58.633
It was a boy, yes.
He had a little tiny penis.

01:02:58.753 --> 01:03:01.873
And then you look at him,
and he's in the formaldehyde jar.

01:03:01.953 --> 01:03:03.873
And I said to my wife,
"Honey, don't be upset

01:03:03.953 --> 01:03:05.873
that Howard Jr.'s
in a formaldehyde jar.

01:03:05.953 --> 01:03:07.873
We're gonna take him out of
this office, we'll bring him home,

01:03:07.953 --> 01:03:09.953
and next week we'll bring him
to the zoo in a stroller."

01:03:10.033 --> 01:03:11.833
Oh, please!

01:03:11.873 --> 01:03:13.473
I don't want to talk
about it, Robin.

01:03:13.593 --> 01:03:14.913
I really think
you need counseling.

01:03:14.993 --> 01:03:17.273
I'm gonna play a record.
DC 101.

01:03:17.313 --> 01:03:19.313
We got some great tunes
for you this morning,

01:03:19.393 --> 01:03:22.473
and then Robin will analyze me
when we get back from this song.

01:03:22.513 --> 01:03:24.513
Very sad music.

01:03:25.753 --> 01:03:28.073
Not that, Fred.
Play something else, please.

01:03:28.153 --> 01:03:29.553
For God's sake.

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:32.833
DC 101. Here's
rock 'n' roll for you.

01:03:40.913 --> 01:03:43.353
Hi. Al, you home?

01:03:46.153 --> 01:03:48.073
Hi. How you feeling?
You OK?

01:03:48.153 --> 01:03:50.073
How could you do that?
Do you think that was funny?

01:03:50.153 --> 01:03:53.113
You think it's funny to make jokes
about our personal life like that?

01:03:53.153 --> 01:03:54.593
You're an asshole!

01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:56.433
What are you
talking about?

01:03:56.513 --> 01:03:58.633
Alison, I love you.
What are you talking about?

01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:00.633
Howard, not everything
is for your audience.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:03.313
I need a life that is ours,
that belongs to us.

01:04:03.393 --> 01:04:05.393
I'm on the air 5 hours a day.
I'm trying to come up with material.

01:04:05.433 --> 01:04:06.593
I hate going out.

01:04:06.713 --> 01:04:08.033
Too bad!

01:04:08.113 --> 01:04:10.393
I said when we came here,
if I was gonna win on the radio,

01:04:10.433 --> 01:04:12.193
I'd have to talk about everything.
I couldn't hold back.

01:04:12.273 --> 01:04:15.113
- Howard...
- Come on, last night we were laughing about this.

01:04:15.193 --> 01:04:17.193
I just assumed
you thought it was funny.

01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:19.033
It was funny for us
last night.

01:04:19.073 --> 01:04:20.353
Privately, for us.

01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:22.313
Alison, if I don't talk about
you and me on the air...

01:04:22.393 --> 01:04:23.313
Shut up. Shut up.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.833
The audience isn't
gonna be there.

01:04:24.913 --> 01:04:25.833
Shut up! Shut up!

01:04:25.913 --> 01:04:26.833
I won't make any money.

01:04:26.913 --> 01:04:27.833
Shut up!
You disgust me!

01:04:27.913 --> 01:04:29.793
I can't even look
at you, idiot!

01:04:34.153 --> 01:04:35.553
It's hard, you know.

01:04:35.673 --> 01:04:40.073
When he shares our most personal
details of our life together

01:04:40.153 --> 01:04:42.593
with, you know,
millions of listeners, it's...

01:04:44.953 --> 01:04:48.353
I wish that there were
more things that could be just ours.

01:04:50.953 --> 01:04:53.873
But I think it's right that
I go crazy, you know?

01:04:53.953 --> 01:04:57.873
You know, I think...
I don't know.

01:04:57.953 --> 01:04:59.353
It's not simple.

01:05:02.353 --> 01:05:07.153
Our entire Washington
radio audience has disappeared.

01:05:07.233 --> 01:05:09.673
It seems the competition
has a disc jockey

01:05:09.753 --> 01:05:13.953
that's caused a bit of a shift
in the listening patterns.

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:18.713
One disc jockey has wiped out
our entire audience?

01:05:19.873 --> 01:05:21.193
Can we get him?

01:05:22.473 --> 01:05:25.033
I've got such good news.
It's gonna blow your mind.

01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:26.553
All right.
You go first.

01:05:26.633 --> 01:05:29.073
OK. All right,
That's rude. You go first.

01:05:29.113 --> 01:05:30.073
Go first.

01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:31.553
OK. Listen to this.

01:05:31.633 --> 01:05:33.593
I listen to radio.
I like show.

01:05:33.673 --> 01:05:36.593
But don't make fun
of the Chinese people.

01:05:36.673 --> 01:05:38.273
Make fun, not funny.

01:05:38.353 --> 01:05:39.753
I didn't make fun
of the Chinese people, did I?

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:40.753
Probably.

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:42.993
I bring egg rolls.

01:05:44.393 --> 01:05:47.353
What is your news?
What is it?

01:05:47.393 --> 01:05:49.353
It's unbelievable.

01:05:49.393 --> 01:05:52.393
I got a job offer today
from WNBC in New York.

01:05:52.473 --> 01:05:55.913
Afternoon drive, the most powerful
radio station in their chain,

01:05:56.033 --> 01:05:57.433
$150,000 a year.

01:05:57.473 --> 01:05:59.913
And they said
if I do really well,

01:06:00.033 --> 01:06:02.233
they're gonna syndicate
my program all over the country.

01:06:02.313 --> 01:06:04.273
This is it.
This is everything I want.

01:06:04.313 --> 01:06:07.153
It's like...
It's the dream, the Big Apple.

01:06:07.233 --> 01:06:09.873
I'm pregnant.

01:06:12.433 --> 01:06:14.073
You're pregnant?

01:06:14.153 --> 01:06:15.793
Mm-hmm.

01:06:19.233 --> 01:06:20.273
Come here.

01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:21.273
What?

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:22.953
Come here.
Just come here.

01:06:23.033 --> 01:06:24.313
Come here.

01:06:24.393 --> 01:06:25.313
My God.

01:06:25.433 --> 01:06:26.313
Pregnant?

01:06:28.393 --> 01:06:29.673
So what's going on?
What's gonna happen?

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:30.673
Everything's good.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:31.673
Yeah?

01:06:31.753 --> 01:06:33.193
She's gonna
get naked?

01:06:33.273 --> 01:06:34.673
Yeah, sure. Of course.

01:06:34.753 --> 01:06:37.193
All right. Let's get her out.
Let's do it.

01:06:37.273 --> 01:06:38.673
She'll get naked?

01:06:38.753 --> 01:06:40.193
Yeah. That's why
we're here, man.

01:06:41.913 --> 01:06:42.793
OK, honey.

01:06:42.913 --> 01:06:44.313
Hi. How's it going?

01:06:44.393 --> 01:06:46.793
- Oh, my God.
- This is Gary.

01:06:46.913 --> 01:06:48.353
How you doing?

01:06:48.393 --> 01:06:51.353
Good. I'm sorry. I know
I told you I'd do this,

01:06:51.393 --> 01:06:52.793
but I've really
changed my mind.

01:06:52.913 --> 01:06:54.353
I don't want to do it
anymore.

01:06:54.393 --> 01:06:56.353
OK. What's, uh, like,
what's the problem?

01:06:56.393 --> 01:06:58.353
What are you
worried about?

01:06:58.433 --> 01:06:59.833
I just changed my mind.

01:06:59.913 --> 01:07:01.353
Husband: What do you mean?
You are doing it.

01:07:01.433 --> 01:07:03.353
We didn't drive here
for you to change your mind.

01:07:03.433 --> 01:07:05.353
No. It's just very
humiliating to me.

01:07:05.433 --> 01:07:06.353
What's humiliating?

01:07:06.433 --> 01:07:07.513
It's not that big a deal.

01:07:07.593 --> 01:07:09.353
We've done it a lot
on the show.

01:07:09.433 --> 01:07:11.833
I think Howard would appreciate it
if you would do it for us.

01:07:11.913 --> 01:07:14.313
No. I changed my mind,
and I'm really sorry.

01:07:14.353 --> 01:07:17.313
I know I told you that I'd do it,
but I don't want to.

01:07:17.353 --> 01:07:18.793
I think it's
very humiliating.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.793
Husband: Honey, this is not humiliating.
This is show business.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.793
You got a great body.
Let everybody see it.

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:24.313
Yeah. You're beautiful.

01:07:24.393 --> 01:07:26.793
You're my husband. Don't make me do
something I don't want to do.

01:07:26.833 --> 01:07:28.793
I'm proud of you,
and I want you to do it.

01:07:28.833 --> 01:07:30.793
That's why we drove here
from Jersey.

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.833
What the hell is
this donkey here for?

01:07:32.868 --> 01:07:34.833
Nobody told me anything
about a donkey.

01:07:34.868 --> 01:07:35.993
It's a show business
donkey.

01:07:36.033 --> 01:07:37.473
The donkey's not part
of the act.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.993
It had nothing
to do with you.

01:07:39.073 --> 01:07:40.993
You'll feel at ease
once we go do it.

01:07:41.073 --> 01:07:42.473
It'll just
take 2 seconds.

01:07:42.553 --> 01:07:44.313
Right now, I need to know,
are you doing it or not?

01:07:44.393 --> 01:07:45.313
No, I'm not.

01:07:45.393 --> 01:07:46.833
Honey, you are doing it.

01:07:46.873 --> 01:07:49.313
I changed my mind. And you're
my husband. You should support me.

01:07:49.393 --> 01:07:50.993
Howard goes to New York.

01:07:51.073 --> 01:07:52.833
Thanks for nothing.
Gino, let the donkey go.

01:07:52.873 --> 01:07:56.313
Come on, guys. Wrap it up.
They're not doing it.

01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:04.073
# Let's dance #

01:08:05.633 --> 01:08:07.353
# Put on your red shoes #

01:08:07.433 --> 01:08:09.513
# And dance the blues #

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.833
# Let's dance #

01:08:12.873 --> 01:08:18.792
# To the song they're
playing on the radio... #

01:08:18.872 --> 01:08:21.792
Reporter: What you're about
to hear is going to shock you

01:08:21.872 --> 01:08:23.712
because it's vulgar
and obscene.

01:08:23.792 --> 01:08:27.113
It's x-rated radio,
barnyard radio.

01:08:27.153 --> 01:08:29.953
You mommies and daddies out there
who complained to the radio station,

01:08:30.033 --> 01:08:31.792
I got something
to say to you.

01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:33.553
Here.

01:08:33.633 --> 01:08:35.792
Reporter: This is a story
with a twist.

01:08:35.872 --> 01:08:37.953
While we were producing
this report,

01:08:38.033 --> 01:08:41.313
Howard Stern was lured away from
Washington by a New York City station.

01:08:41.393 --> 01:08:44.832
That station,
you guessed it, is WNBC...

01:08:47.712 --> 01:08:52.313
This person is coming here
to work at our flagship station?

01:08:52.393 --> 01:08:54.832
Yes.

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:57.872
Brad, you gave this
trash-talking bastard a 3-year deal

01:08:57.912 --> 01:08:59.393
without even hearing him
on the air?

01:08:59.473 --> 01:09:00.393
Yes, Roger.

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:01.553
He's on the FCC's
most-wanted list.

01:09:01.633 --> 01:09:02.633
Roger, his rate...

01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:03.912
Chuck, will you show
him the numbers.

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:05.073
Through the roof.

01:09:05.153 --> 01:09:06.593
No, no. Don't bother.

01:09:06.633 --> 01:09:09.273
You're fired,
all of you. Get out.

01:09:12.633 --> 01:09:13.712
Get out!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.313
You know,
unless he quits,

01:09:30.353 --> 01:09:33.313
it's gonna cost half
a million dollars

01:09:33.353 --> 01:09:35.153
to buy
Stern's contract out.

01:09:35.233 --> 01:09:37.593
I reject that
on principle.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.792
Uh, Mr. Erlick,
if I may?

01:09:42.993 --> 01:09:44.912
Put me in charge
of the Stern show.

01:09:44.993 --> 01:09:46.912
Let me ride herd on him,

01:09:46.993 --> 01:09:49.953
and I'll mold that son of a bitch
into another Don Imus.

01:09:49.993 --> 01:09:51.313
When I'm through
whipping him,

01:09:51.393 --> 01:09:54.593
that boy will be asking
permission to wipe his ass.

01:09:54.673 --> 01:09:55.673
You want to tame him?

01:09:55.793 --> 01:09:57.713
Well,
either I'll tame him,

01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:59.793
or I'll make him
so crazy...

01:09:59.913 --> 01:10:00.993
he'll quit.

01:10:01.073 --> 01:10:04.153
So either way,
we win.

01:10:05.473 --> 01:10:07.873
I'll tell you,
these halls are, like,

01:10:07.953 --> 01:10:09.353
you know, uh,
legendary.

01:10:09.433 --> 01:10:10.633
It's pretty wild.

01:10:10.713 --> 01:10:11.873
Kenny. Howard Stern.

01:10:11.953 --> 01:10:13.193
Hi. Hey,
How you doing?

01:10:13.273 --> 01:10:14.153
Howard!

01:10:14.193 --> 01:10:15.433
Great to meet you.

01:10:15.513 --> 01:10:17.433
Oh, it is such a pleasure
to meet you, Howard.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.793
What can I say?
This is unbelievable, you know.

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:22.273
Kenny is the hottest
young programmer in New York City.

01:10:22.353 --> 01:10:25.153
Howard, you gotta listen
to this man 'cause he's a genius.

01:10:25.233 --> 01:10:26.873
Come on, now.
Ha ha ha ha.

01:10:26.953 --> 01:10:27.873
Play nice.

01:10:27.953 --> 01:10:29.273
Kenny: Thanks, man.
God bless.

01:10:29.353 --> 01:10:30.793
Good seeing you.
I'll see you later.

01:10:30.873 --> 01:10:31.833
He's terrific.

01:10:31.953 --> 01:10:33.233
Oh, yeah,
he's been terrific.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:34.713
Everyone's been so nice.
It's a good feeling.

01:10:34.793 --> 01:10:36.713
Howard, how about
you have a seat?

01:10:36.793 --> 01:10:39.353
Oh, Howard, Howard,
Howard, Howard, Howard.

01:10:41.273 --> 01:10:44.313
Howard... the way
we work here at NBC...

01:10:44.393 --> 01:10:47.793
is a more professional manner
than you're probably used to.

01:10:47.873 --> 01:10:51.593
Now, see, I don't care about
what you did down in Washington,

01:10:51.633 --> 01:10:53.593
'cause that's
chickenshit radio.

01:10:53.633 --> 01:10:56.713
Here at NBC,
this is real radio.

01:10:56.793 --> 01:10:59.233
And the first thing
you've gotta do

01:10:59.273 --> 01:11:02.033
is say the call letters
properly, OK?

01:11:02.113 --> 01:11:05.553
Now, I'm gonna teach you
how to say them, all right?

01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:07.873
And you know,
I hope you can get them,

01:11:07.953 --> 01:11:10.313
because, see, you don't
have a real good voice

01:11:10.393 --> 01:11:11.873
like Imus or Captain Frank
or nothing,

01:11:11.953 --> 01:11:13.793
so we're gonna
have to practice it.

01:11:13.873 --> 01:11:15.313
Well...

01:11:15.353 --> 01:11:18.073
you mean practice
in here now?

01:11:18.153 --> 01:11:21.793
You're not going to get bashful
on me now, are you, Howard?

01:11:21.873 --> 01:11:23.273
OK, you ready?

01:11:23.353 --> 01:11:25.673
The way it's said
properly is...

01:11:27.153 --> 01:11:30.593
WNBC.

01:11:33.073 --> 01:11:34.473
This is key.

01:11:34.513 --> 01:11:35.793
Come on.

01:11:35.873 --> 01:11:37.633
WNBC.

01:11:37.673 --> 01:11:38.633
No. No.

01:11:38.713 --> 01:11:40.233
It's gotta be more
like this.

01:11:40.313 --> 01:11:41.513
Listen up.

01:11:41.593 --> 01:11:43.553
WNBC.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:45.073
You hear that?

01:11:45.113 --> 01:11:47.353
Kinda lift,
that NBC.

01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:49.873
WNBC.

01:11:49.953 --> 01:11:52.633
WNBC.

01:11:52.713 --> 01:11:53.913
Wider and kind of...

01:11:53.993 --> 01:11:54.913
WNBC.

01:11:54.993 --> 01:11:55.913
One more.

01:11:55.993 --> 01:11:57.393
In my mind,
I'm hearing...

01:11:57.473 --> 01:11:59.353
It sounds like I'm saying
exactly what you're saying.

01:11:59.433 --> 01:12:00.353
No. Actually...

01:12:00.433 --> 01:12:01.553
WNBC.

01:12:01.633 --> 01:12:02.993
You've gotta
listen to Imus.

01:12:03.033 --> 01:12:05.473
Imus does it
perfectly.

01:12:05.553 --> 01:12:08.473
Tell you what. I'm gonna take you
down to Imus' office right now,

01:12:08.553 --> 01:12:10.833
and you're gonna hear how he does it.
Come on, boy.

01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:12.313
- You know, I...
- Come on.

01:12:12.393 --> 01:12:13.833
I gotta tell you
something, Kenny.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:15.753
I always saw myself sort of
something different than Imus.

01:12:15.833 --> 01:12:17.273
That's why
you hired me.

01:12:17.313 --> 01:12:19.753
You are original. You are original,
but...

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:21.753
You say a lot
of offensive things,

01:12:21.833 --> 01:12:23.753
and occasionally
you are real funny,

01:12:23.833 --> 01:12:26.273
but you've got to learn
to do what Imus does.

01:12:26.353 --> 01:12:28.873
See, he doesn't actually
say the bad thing himself.

01:12:28.993 --> 01:12:30.393
He says it
through a character.

01:12:30.473 --> 01:12:31.913
Yeah, well,
I don't do character...

01:12:31.993 --> 01:12:34.913
How about you go on
the air 3 a.m. This morning,

01:12:34.993 --> 01:12:36.433
show us some characters.
OK?

01:12:36.473 --> 01:12:38.833
Good. Now,
I'm gonna go in there

01:12:38.913 --> 01:12:42.033
and just see how he's feeling.
You stay here. OK?

01:12:43.433 --> 01:12:44.833
Mr. Imus?

01:12:48.113 --> 01:12:49.273
Howard: Back then,

01:12:49.313 --> 01:12:51.713
Don Imus was the number one
disc jockey in New York,

01:12:51.753 --> 01:12:53.473
so I guess I was kind of
curious to meet him.

01:12:53.553 --> 01:12:54.513
Imus: You are
interrupting me.

01:12:54.553 --> 01:12:56.953
Kenny: I have, uh,
Howard Stern outside.

01:12:57.033 --> 01:12:58.073
You have who outside?

01:12:58.153 --> 01:12:59.633
The young man
from Washington that we...

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:01.633
You have Howard Stern
outside my fucking office?

01:13:01.713 --> 01:13:03.833
How did Howard Stern
get outside my fucking office?

01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:05.193
I brought him down...

01:13:05.273 --> 01:13:07.113
Well, I'm not gonna meet
that stupid fuck. He's nothing.

01:13:08.633 --> 01:13:09.593
Fuck off!

01:13:12.353 --> 01:13:14.193
# 66 #

01:13:14.273 --> 01:13:17.713
# WNBC #

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.273
Hello. I'm Robin Quivers,

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:22.353
and it's my great pleasure
to introduce you

01:13:22.473 --> 01:13:24.713
to New York's
newest disc jockey.

01:13:24.753 --> 01:13:27.193
Howard, Lisping:
Ooo-ey, that's me.

01:13:27.273 --> 01:13:29.953
Hi. I'm Lance Eluxina
on WNBC.

01:13:30.033 --> 01:13:30.953
WNBC.

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:32.353
I'm so excited

01:13:32.433 --> 01:13:35.193
because I am New York's
first ever gay disc jockey.

01:13:35.273 --> 01:13:36.193
Ever!

01:13:36.273 --> 01:13:38.113
And now I want to
introduce to you...

01:13:38.193 --> 01:13:39.153
This is
so exciting...

01:13:39.273 --> 01:13:40.273
I want to introduce
to you

01:13:40.393 --> 01:13:42.433
someone so marvelous,
so wonderful to me,

01:13:42.513 --> 01:13:43.753
someone who
has supported me,

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.953
is my life mate,
my soul mate, my love mate.

01:13:46.033 --> 01:13:48.673
He's everything and anything
to me, Mr. Blackswell.

01:13:48.753 --> 01:13:50.193
Willkommen. Bienvenue.

01:13:50.233 --> 01:13:53.233
Welcome. Oh, Robin, it's so lovely
to see you here today.

01:13:53.313 --> 01:13:54.673
Hi, Mr. Engineer. Hi.

01:13:54.713 --> 01:13:57.513
Mmm. Give me
a kiss. Mmm!

01:13:57.593 --> 01:13:59.953
You two are just
adorable together,

01:14:00.033 --> 01:14:02.513
and it's a wonderful thing
to have you here,

01:14:02.553 --> 01:14:05.073
but I understand there's
already been a problem?

01:14:05.193 --> 01:14:06.193
Yes. You know
about this?

01:14:06.313 --> 01:14:07.873
I was in the program
director's office.

01:14:07.993 --> 01:14:09.033
His name
is Pig Vomit.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:10.553
Yes, because he
looks like a pig,

01:14:10.593 --> 01:14:11.793
and he makes you
want to vomit.

01:14:11.873 --> 01:14:12.793
He's Pig Vomit.

01:14:12.873 --> 01:14:14.113
Anyway, Pig Vomit
says to me,

01:14:14.193 --> 01:14:15.873
"This is not WNBC.

01:14:15.953 --> 01:14:19.353
It is WNBC,
WNBC,"

01:14:19.433 --> 01:14:21.113
and I was not saying
the call letters right.

01:14:21.193 --> 01:14:22.433
It's a big problem,

01:14:22.513 --> 01:14:24.793
so in order
to rectify this,

01:14:24.873 --> 01:14:27.073
I brought in a cup
of Blackswell's semen.

01:14:27.153 --> 01:14:28.753
Semen?

01:14:28.833 --> 01:14:30.073
I squoze it myself.

01:14:30.113 --> 01:14:31.713
I hope it's
not too tangy.

01:14:31.793 --> 01:14:32.793
And what are you
gonna do with it?

01:14:32.913 --> 01:14:34.353
I'm gonna gargle
with this

01:14:34.433 --> 01:14:36.153
and say the call letters over
and over again until I get it right.

01:14:36.233 --> 01:14:37.473
You think
that'll work?

01:14:37.553 --> 01:14:39.833
I don't care, 'cause I love
the taste of a man. Ooga.

01:14:41.633 --> 01:14:43.033
All right, if I could
have some music now.

01:14:43.113 --> 01:14:45.073
Mr. Engineer, please,
some music.

01:14:45.153 --> 01:14:47.273
Would you, please?
Would you give us a record,

01:14:47.353 --> 01:14:48.273
por favor?

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:51.233
OK, thank you.

01:14:51.273 --> 01:14:53.673
Now watch and learn.

01:14:53.753 --> 01:14:55.473
# La la la
la la la #

01:15:01.473 --> 01:15:02.433
There she blows.

01:15:05.473 --> 01:15:07.953
Oh. Can you believe it?

01:15:08.073 --> 01:15:09.433
You just swallowed.

01:15:09.513 --> 01:15:11.073
I swallowed.
Oh, my God.

01:15:11.193 --> 01:15:12.713
Waste not,
want not, Robin.

01:15:12.793 --> 01:15:14.073
Oh!

01:15:14.153 --> 01:15:18.513
I wanna say I love
WNBC.

01:15:18.593 --> 01:15:19.833
See? It worked.
I can say it.

01:15:19.913 --> 01:15:21.833
WNBC.

01:15:24.673 --> 01:15:30.593
- WNBC, please hold.
- WNBC, please hold.

01:15:30.673 --> 01:15:32.193
Record:
# Stop it now... #

01:15:34.873 --> 01:15:38.073
So we gave them
some characters, right?

01:15:41.673 --> 01:15:42.593
Get in.

01:15:50.673 --> 01:15:53.313
You goddamn
motherfuckers.

01:15:53.353 --> 01:15:54.873
You fucking waltz
in here,

01:15:54.993 --> 01:15:56.993
and you think you know
everything, don't you?

01:15:57.113 --> 01:15:59.513
Well, I fucking worked
my fucking ass off

01:15:59.593 --> 01:16:01.033
to get to
New York City,

01:16:01.073 --> 01:16:02.473
and you sure as fuck

01:16:02.513 --> 01:16:05.273
are not gonna fucking
blow it for me!

01:16:05.353 --> 01:16:06.273
I was just
doing character...

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:07.273
Barry, Jerry,

01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:09.673
clarify the situation
for him, please.

01:16:09.713 --> 01:16:11.673
Page 108,
paragraph 3:

01:16:11.753 --> 01:16:13.433
"No jokes dealing
with flatulence,

01:16:13.513 --> 01:16:15.713
"excretion, urination,
ejaculation,

01:16:15.753 --> 01:16:17.153
or other
bodily functions."

01:16:17.193 --> 01:16:18.433
Also note paragraph 2:

01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:20.313
"No use of the so-called
7 dirty words.

01:16:20.393 --> 01:16:21.793
"These are cocksucker,
motherfucker,

01:16:21.873 --> 01:16:23.993
fuck, shit, cunt,
cock, and pussy."

01:16:24.073 --> 01:16:27.033
Now, from now on,
all your little bits

01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:29.473
are gonna be under
2 minutes in duration,

01:16:29.553 --> 01:16:32.993
and all scripts...
and I do mean all scripts...

01:16:33.073 --> 01:16:34.833
require
my personal approval.

01:16:34.913 --> 01:16:37.113
Welcome to NBC, Howard.

01:16:37.193 --> 01:16:40.633
# 66, WNBC #

01:16:40.713 --> 01:16:44.393
It's time for
The Match Game.

01:16:45.593 --> 01:16:47.393
And thank you,
Mr. Announcer.

01:16:47.513 --> 01:16:50.353
Hi, everybody.
My name is Gene Sternburn,

01:16:50.393 --> 01:16:53.353
and welcome
to Match Game.

01:16:53.393 --> 01:16:55.153
We have a lot of excitement
in the air today

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:57.033
because we have
some great panelists.

01:16:57.113 --> 01:16:59.033
Let me introduce you
to everybody.

01:16:59.193 --> 01:17:00.753
First of all, I want to
introduce all of you

01:17:00.833 --> 01:17:03.393
to a very, very charming
and beautiful lady,

01:17:03.473 --> 01:17:05.273
the very beautiful
Miss Brett Somers.

01:17:05.353 --> 01:17:06.273
How are you, baby?

01:17:06.353 --> 01:17:07.593
Hi, Gene.

01:17:07.673 --> 01:17:09.713
Hygiene, that's something
I don't think you have.

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:11.273
Hey, back off.

01:17:11.353 --> 01:17:14.393
OK, and let's now go over
to somebody who I really admire,

01:17:14.513 --> 01:17:17.033
the ex-president of
the United States, Mr. Richard Nixon.

01:17:17.113 --> 01:17:18.513
Hello, everybody. Hello.

01:17:18.593 --> 01:17:20.673
I'm very, very honored
right now

01:17:20.753 --> 01:17:23.753
to introduce to all of you
a very special man.

01:17:23.833 --> 01:17:26.313
He's come all the way
to our show for the first time.

01:17:26.393 --> 01:17:28.833
Mr. Jackie "The Jokeman"
Martling.

01:17:28.913 --> 01:17:30.593
Well, thank you, Gene.
That's very nice of you.

01:17:30.713 --> 01:17:32.273
Let's play our game now,
OK? Shall we?

01:17:32.393 --> 01:17:35.233
And what we're gonna do is ask you
to fill in the blank, OK?

01:17:35.313 --> 01:17:37.233
Now, I want you
to listen carefully.

01:17:37.273 --> 01:17:39.633
Our first clue up is...

01:17:39.713 --> 01:17:41.433
blank willow.

01:17:41.513 --> 01:17:43.473
Blank willow.

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.513
Let's go over to
Miss Brett Somers right now.

01:17:46.633 --> 01:17:49.033
Now, Brett, what did you
have for us? Blank willow.

01:17:49.113 --> 01:17:51.553
The only thing
on my mind, Gene,

01:17:51.673 --> 01:17:52.593
was pussy.

01:17:52.673 --> 01:17:54.433
Uh-oh.

01:17:54.473 --> 01:17:56.193
Pussy. Hey, all right.

01:17:56.313 --> 01:17:57.593
Hey, that's kind of wild.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.313
Pussy willow, that's
what I would have said.

01:17:59.393 --> 01:18:01.753
All right, let's go over to Dick Nixon,
former president of the United States.

01:18:01.793 --> 01:18:03.233
What did you have?
Blank willow.

01:18:03.313 --> 01:18:04.833
In any language, pussy.

01:18:04.953 --> 01:18:06.793
All right!

01:18:06.873 --> 01:18:08.233
Now let's go
to our newest member

01:18:08.313 --> 01:18:09.553
of the panel,

01:18:09.633 --> 01:18:13.593
Mr. Jackie "Jokeman"
Martling. Blank willow.

01:18:13.673 --> 01:18:15.153
Well, Gene, I didn't
write it too neat,

01:18:15.273 --> 01:18:16.713
so I have
a sloppy pussy.

01:18:16.793 --> 01:18:18.193
Sloppy pussy!

01:18:18.273 --> 01:18:20.473
We had a sloppy and a fuzzy
pussy and a very big one.

01:18:20.553 --> 01:18:22.033
Are we talking
about Brett again?

01:18:22.113 --> 01:18:24.033
All right, now,
Let's keep going.

01:18:24.113 --> 01:18:25.993
Now it's gonna get
a little rougher, OK?

01:18:26.073 --> 01:18:27.353
Everybody ready?

01:18:27.433 --> 01:18:29.953
Blank a-doodle-doo.

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:31.113
Blank a-doodle-doo.

01:18:32.233 --> 01:18:33.513
Blank a-doodle-doo.

01:18:33.593 --> 01:18:35.753
Think about that while
the celebrities are writing.

01:18:35.873 --> 01:18:37.673
Here we are. Let's go over
to our Dick Nixon,

01:18:37.753 --> 01:18:39.153
our own ex-president.
What do you got there, Dick?

01:18:39.233 --> 01:18:41.753
Well, it takes a Dick to know
a cock, and that's what I wrote.

01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:43.833
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:45.273
Now, that's what
I would have said.

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:46.913
That seemed
like the obvious answer.

01:18:47.033 --> 01:18:48.553
OK, let's go to our own
Jackie "The Jokeman" Martling.

01:18:48.673 --> 01:18:49.593
Jackie The Jokeman?

01:18:49.673 --> 01:18:51.753
Gene, I have cock,
and I wrote it big.

01:18:51.873 --> 01:18:53.193
I have a big cock.

01:18:53.273 --> 01:18:55.713
Uh, I don't think you can
say "big cock" on the radio.

01:18:55.793 --> 01:18:56.873
I think that's a no-no.

01:18:56.953 --> 01:18:58.433
But I just said pussy.

01:18:58.513 --> 01:18:59.473
Yeah, she
just said pussy.

01:18:59.553 --> 01:19:01.833
Yes, pussy is OK.
It's the way he says it.

01:19:01.913 --> 01:19:04.273
"Big cock" coming out of
your mouth sounds awfully dirty.

01:19:04.353 --> 01:19:06.273
So I can't say
"big cock,"

01:19:06.353 --> 01:19:08.313
but you can say "big cock
coming out of my mouth"?

01:19:08.393 --> 01:19:09.873
- That's correct.
- That sucks.

01:19:09.993 --> 01:19:13.353
Did you just say, "big cock
coming out of your mouth sucks"?

01:19:13.433 --> 01:19:15.473
All right,
enough of this nonsense.

01:19:15.553 --> 01:19:17.273
We gotta move
to Miss Brett Somers.

01:19:17.393 --> 01:19:19.633
Just like the boys,
Gene, I've got cock.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:22.073
There it is, cock-a-doo...
do me a favor

01:19:22.113 --> 01:19:24.233
and hold that up
so I can see your cock.

01:19:24.313 --> 01:19:26.633
Aw, Gene, don't
have...

01:19:26.713 --> 01:19:29.313
All right, there it is.
Cock, cock, cock.

01:19:29.433 --> 01:19:32.353
I must tell you, though,
we have to end this fun right now.

01:19:32.433 --> 01:19:34.273
I want to thank all of you.
Give yourselves a big hand.

01:19:38.353 --> 01:19:41.193
OK, let's have
a little music, Phil.

01:19:41.273 --> 01:19:44.353
You did not have permission
to do that bit.

01:19:44.433 --> 01:19:46.513
I never approved that script,
God damn it, Howard!

01:19:46.593 --> 01:19:48.553
Wait a second.
Calm down, OK, Kenny?

01:19:48.673 --> 01:19:50.033
There's a perfectly
good explanation.

01:19:50.113 --> 01:19:51.833
I'm all ears, Howard.
Let's hear it.

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:54.553
I gave the script
to Fred.

01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:57.113
And I gave it to Robin over there.

01:19:57.233 --> 01:20:00.113
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry, Kenny.

01:20:00.193 --> 01:20:01.313
I forgot to put it
in your box.

01:20:01.433 --> 01:20:02.913
There you go.
Perfectly good explanation.

01:20:03.033 --> 01:20:04.993
It'll never happen again,
Kenny.

01:20:05.113 --> 01:20:07.833
You're goddamn right she's never
gonna do it again. You're fired.

01:20:07.913 --> 01:20:08.913
What?

01:20:09.033 --> 01:20:11.113
Gather your things together,
Robin. Let's go.

01:20:11.193 --> 01:20:13.113
Wait a second, Kenny.
What are you talking about?

01:20:13.193 --> 01:20:14.753
She had nothing
to do with the bit.

01:20:14.873 --> 01:20:15.913
It was all me.

01:20:15.993 --> 01:20:17.233
Pack up your shit.
I'm not kidding. Let's go.

01:20:17.353 --> 01:20:19.553
Kenny, you can't blame
someone over one lousy bit.

01:20:19.633 --> 01:20:20.833
You can't go firing them.

01:20:20.953 --> 01:20:23.433
Oh, yes, I can, Howard.

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:25.033
Robin, get the fuck out!

01:20:25.153 --> 01:20:26.993
# ... A boy could give you #

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:28.473
# Take my tears and... #

01:20:28.553 --> 01:20:29.913
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:20:29.993 --> 01:20:31.753
If you give me
a couple of days,

01:20:31.833 --> 01:20:33.353
I know I can get you
back on the air.

01:20:33.473 --> 01:20:34.833
Forget it.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.593
They're trying to break us apart.
They're trying to beat us.

01:20:36.713 --> 01:20:38.633
That's the whole point.
You and Fred should quit,

01:20:38.713 --> 01:20:40.073
and we should go
somewhere else.

01:20:40.153 --> 01:20:42.433
Quit? If I quit,
they win.

01:20:42.513 --> 01:20:44.833
Don't you see? I don't want them to win.
I can't quit.

01:20:44.913 --> 01:20:46.353
- You're not gonna quit?
- No.

01:20:46.393 --> 01:20:48.113
You're gonna let 'em
throw me out like garbage?

01:20:48.193 --> 01:20:50.233
No. I want to beat these guys,
stomp them into the ground.

01:20:50.353 --> 01:20:52.353
The only way to do that
is to stay on the air.

01:20:52.433 --> 01:20:53.593
I've gotta stay
on the air, Robin.

01:20:53.713 --> 01:20:54.633
You're pathetic.

01:20:54.713 --> 01:20:55.873
I'm not pathetic.

01:20:55.993 --> 01:20:57.993
Just give me a couple of days
to make them understand.

01:20:58.113 --> 01:20:59.793
I can convince these guys
to bring you back.

01:20:59.873 --> 01:21:01.913
I know I can do that.
I have that ability.

01:21:02.033 --> 01:21:03.313
Fuck you.

01:21:03.393 --> 01:21:04.753
They're gonna hire you back.
How can you say "fuck you"?

01:21:06.193 --> 01:21:07.913
Hey, move it,
asshole!

01:21:08.033 --> 01:21:09.593
She hates me. She thinks
I'm total scum.

01:21:09.673 --> 01:21:11.113
She thinks
I'm lower than scum.

01:21:11.193 --> 01:21:13.553
She thinks you're
letting her take the fall.

01:21:13.633 --> 01:21:15.033
Well, what do you think?

01:21:16.993 --> 01:21:19.793
I think you've been loyal
to every person you've ever worked with.

01:21:19.873 --> 01:21:21.793
That's the way you are,
you know?

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:23.913
You'll find a way
to get her back.

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:27.193
In fact,
I feel sorry for NBC,

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:28.673
because as soon
as you start in on them,

01:21:28.793 --> 01:21:30.793
they're gonna be sorry they ever
fired her in the first place.

01:21:30.873 --> 01:21:32.793
You're right.

01:21:32.873 --> 01:21:34.193
I know.

01:21:34.273 --> 01:21:39.593
Howard, Fred, I'd like you
to meet your new newsman,

01:21:39.673 --> 01:21:41.153
Ross Buckingham.

01:21:41.273 --> 01:21:43.073
Hi. Pleasure.

01:21:43.113 --> 01:21:45.073
I'm looking forward
to joining the team.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:46.873
Now, old Ross here's
quite lively,

01:21:46.953 --> 01:21:48.073
and I think he'll
fit in well

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:49.313
with your special
brand of humor.

01:21:49.393 --> 01:21:51.353
As a matter of fact,

01:21:51.393 --> 01:21:54.513
I'm a bit of
an old comedy man myself.

01:21:54.593 --> 01:21:57.673
I've done quite a bit
of light comedy in my younger years.

01:21:57.793 --> 01:22:00.313
Summer stock... mostly.

01:22:02.273 --> 01:22:05.433
Hundreds of people gathered
in Central Park this afternoon

01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:07.513
to remember former Beatle
John Lennon,

01:22:07.593 --> 01:22:10.273
who was murdered 2 years ago
today. Lennon's killer...

01:22:10.393 --> 01:22:11.873
Hey, let me
ask you something, Ross.

01:22:11.913 --> 01:22:13.393
Were you a Beatles fan?

01:22:13.473 --> 01:22:17.153
Uh... y-yes,
I... I was, once.

01:22:17.273 --> 01:22:19.713
Lennon's killer,
Mark David Chapman...

01:22:19.753 --> 01:22:22.753
Now, Mark David Chapman, now,
there's a guy we gotta talk about, Ross.

01:22:22.873 --> 01:22:24.753
Mark David Chapman,
what do you make of him?

01:22:24.833 --> 01:22:27.713
I mean, he's probably in a prison cell
right now enjoying himself.

01:22:27.753 --> 01:22:31.353
I say electrocute him. You gotta be
with that program, huh, Ross?

01:22:31.433 --> 01:22:33.353
I hope this was a good idea.

01:22:33.433 --> 01:22:35.833
Ross: Uh, I think
we're supposed

01:22:35.913 --> 01:22:37.593
to be having
the news now.

01:22:37.713 --> 01:22:39.513
Howard: Forget that.
Just repeat after me, Ross.

01:22:39.593 --> 01:22:41.273
I want to kill
Mark David Chapman.

01:22:42.953 --> 01:22:44.953
# 66 #

01:22:45.073 --> 01:22:47.913
# WNBC #

01:22:47.993 --> 01:22:49.673
Are we ready in there,
Freddy Boy?

01:22:49.753 --> 01:22:52.033
OK. We've got our next
phone call to Ross.

01:22:52.113 --> 01:22:53.393
Guess who's
on the phone with us.

01:22:53.473 --> 01:22:54.953
I really have no idea.

01:22:55.073 --> 01:22:57.833
Just take a wild guess.
Do it right off the top of your head.

01:22:57.913 --> 01:22:59.713
Um...

01:22:59.793 --> 01:23:01.513
This is a good one.
It's a good mystery guest.

01:23:01.593 --> 01:23:03.593
Um...

01:23:03.713 --> 01:23:05.633
What an ad-libber, Ross.

01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:07.673
All right, I don't want to
put you under too much pressure.

01:23:07.793 --> 01:23:09.073
Hi. Is this
Betty Jean Rushton?

01:23:09.153 --> 01:23:10.113
Yes, it is.

01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:11.793
Betty Jean, hi.
It's Howard Stern,

01:23:11.873 --> 01:23:12.793
WNBC.

01:23:12.873 --> 01:23:14.393
I work with
your husband Kenny.

01:23:14.513 --> 01:23:16.353
Yes. Kenny's
mentioned you.

01:23:16.433 --> 01:23:17.713
Oh, I bet Kenny has.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:20.473
The reason I'm calling
is because your husband

01:23:20.593 --> 01:23:22.713
has been very bitchy
around here lately,

01:23:22.793 --> 01:23:25.873
and I'm thinking that maybe
if you gave him some more sex...

01:23:25.993 --> 01:23:27.393
More sex?

01:23:27.473 --> 01:23:29.953
Yeah. He's backed up.
Isn't he backed up, Ross?

01:23:30.033 --> 01:23:33.113
Yes. You know, you might
be right about that, Howard.

01:23:33.233 --> 01:23:34.633
Oh, really?
I am right.

01:23:34.713 --> 01:23:36.193
Howard!

01:23:36.353 --> 01:23:38.073
You ever do that again,
I'll kill you.

01:23:38.153 --> 01:23:40.313
I need Robin.
She's the anchor on the show.

01:23:40.393 --> 01:23:41.433
That's
what's missing.

01:23:41.513 --> 01:23:42.793
You have violated
my wife.

01:23:42.873 --> 01:23:43.833
I did not.

01:23:43.873 --> 01:23:46.033
You soiled the sanctity
of my home!

01:23:46.113 --> 01:23:47.673
What are you saying?
I didn't do anything.

01:23:47.753 --> 01:23:48.993
I wouldn't even be
doing bits like that

01:23:49.073 --> 01:23:50.473
if Robin was with me.

01:23:50.553 --> 01:23:52.433
I never would have even
called his wife on the air

01:23:52.473 --> 01:23:53.433
if I had Robin
sitting there.

01:23:53.513 --> 01:23:54.713
She's the voice
of reason.

01:23:54.793 --> 01:23:57.713
You know what?
You know what you are, Stern?

01:23:57.793 --> 01:23:59.233
You're the Antichrist.

01:23:59.313 --> 01:24:00.753
- What?
- Yes, that's what you are!

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:03.833
You are the motherfucking
Antichrist!

01:24:03.913 --> 01:24:06.153
Kenny, take it easy.

01:24:13.753 --> 01:24:16.233
Well, this is an exciting day
for us here in the studio

01:24:16.313 --> 01:24:17.713
because we have a stage star
with us.

01:24:17.793 --> 01:24:19.673
This is Donna Porter
with us on the show,

01:24:19.753 --> 01:24:22.633
and she's here to talk
about life in the theater,

01:24:22.673 --> 01:24:24.233
and, Donna, I don't know
if you know this,

01:24:24.313 --> 01:24:26.433
but our own news guy
Ross Buckingham

01:24:26.513 --> 01:24:29.153
actually has some theater experience
as well, don't you, Ross?

01:24:29.233 --> 01:24:31.913
Do you want to tell us
about that?

01:24:31.993 --> 01:24:34.833
Yes. Um... I once did
some summer stock.

01:24:34.913 --> 01:24:36.153
I know you're very,
very proud

01:24:36.233 --> 01:24:37.713
of your summer stock
experience.

01:24:37.753 --> 01:24:39.113
When you went on stage
the very first time,

01:24:39.193 --> 01:24:40.153
did you ever
get nervous?

01:24:40.193 --> 01:24:44.193
No, I was...
quite comfortable.

01:24:44.273 --> 01:24:45.953
Howard: I see.
That's very interesting.

01:24:46.033 --> 01:24:47.433
Then, in 1926,

01:24:47.513 --> 01:24:50.673
General Sarnoff
formed NBC radio,

01:24:50.753 --> 01:24:52.393
America's first network.

01:24:52.473 --> 01:24:55.473
I guess you could say
I was a little nervous

01:24:55.553 --> 01:24:58.673
the first time I was ever
on stage with a 12-inch kielbasa.

01:24:58.753 --> 01:25:00.233
Now, why is that?

01:25:00.313 --> 01:25:01.873
Can I show you?

01:25:03.353 --> 01:25:05.473
Sure. I think we'd like
to see what you have.

01:25:05.553 --> 01:25:07.993
Right now, you're getting
a look at a live broadcast

01:25:08.073 --> 01:25:09.113
of The Howard Stern
Show.

01:25:09.193 --> 01:25:10.353
That's about 13 inches,

01:25:10.433 --> 01:25:12.513
and you're licking
whipped cream off a kielbasa,

01:25:12.593 --> 01:25:13.713
and you're putting it
in your mouth,

01:25:13.793 --> 01:25:15.553
and you're jamming
the kielbasa

01:25:15.593 --> 01:25:17.073
all the way down
your throat.

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:18.393
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

01:25:18.473 --> 01:25:21.073
The entire kielbasa
is going down.

01:25:21.153 --> 01:25:24.073
She has swallowed an entire
13-inch kielbasa.

01:25:24.153 --> 01:25:27.633
Look at that.
A full 13 inches, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:27.713 --> 01:25:30.073
Wow. You gotta
love that, folks.

01:25:30.113 --> 01:25:32.673
You gotta love it,
don't you, Ross? Ho ho.

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:34.713
Ross Buckingham,
have you ever seen a woman

01:25:34.793 --> 01:25:36.753
swallow
an entire 13-inch kielbasa?

01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:37.913
When you were
in the theater,

01:25:38.033 --> 01:25:39.193
did you ever work
with a kielbasa?

01:25:39.273 --> 01:25:40.753
What he did to me today

01:25:40.833 --> 01:25:45.313
was the most unprofessional
and insulting experience of my life.

01:25:45.353 --> 01:25:48.673
I hold you and this station
personally responsible.

01:25:48.753 --> 01:25:50.993
If you want to fire me,
fire me. Go ahead.

01:25:51.073 --> 01:25:54.033
But I refuse to work with
this man one minute longer.

01:25:56.433 --> 01:25:57.553
Good day.

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:02.433
OK, it's 5:35 at WNBC.

01:26:02.473 --> 01:26:03.473
Time for the news.

01:26:03.513 --> 01:26:05.113
I'm not real good
at this, I confess,

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:07.393
but I'm trying...

01:26:07.473 --> 01:26:09.433
Who the fuck
are we gonna get?

01:26:09.513 --> 01:26:12.353
Beats me. No one wants
to work with him.

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:14.673
Is it Monaco or Mon aco?

01:26:15.793 --> 01:26:17.633
Monaco?

01:26:17.713 --> 01:26:19.713
That's what I thought.
Monaco.

01:26:19.793 --> 01:26:21.073
Well, anyway, she's dead.

01:26:21.153 --> 01:26:22.753
You know,
I'm thinking about...

01:26:22.793 --> 01:26:24.593
What about Kelly Landers?

01:26:24.673 --> 01:26:26.753
Absolutely refuses.

01:26:26.833 --> 01:26:27.753
Says she'd rather quit.

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:29.593
I have a theory
that he is the one

01:26:29.633 --> 01:26:31.193
who cut the brakes
on the car.

01:26:31.233 --> 01:26:33.713
Now, I could be crazy, but I figure
a guy who's been married

01:26:33.793 --> 01:26:36.673
as long as Prince Reindeer
is ready for a new wife.

01:26:36.753 --> 01:26:38.753
I mean, Princess Grace...
beautiful woman and all that...

01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:40.513
but she was losing
her looks. Let's be honest.

01:26:40.593 --> 01:26:41.713
There were bags
under those eyes.

01:26:41.793 --> 01:26:43.233
In other news,

01:26:43.313 --> 01:26:45.953
One of Italy's
highest-ranking police officials,

01:26:46.033 --> 01:26:47.993
General Alberto DeCarlo...

01:26:48.073 --> 01:26:52.553
Kenny, we're one of the biggest
radio stations in America.

01:26:52.633 --> 01:26:54.353
We can't just
not do the news.

01:26:54.433 --> 01:26:56.073
My program director
Pig Vomit

01:26:56.153 --> 01:26:59.353
gets assassinated
by Sicilians in Palermo.

01:26:59.433 --> 01:27:00.833
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:02.673
I want to pray to God
right now.

01:27:02.753 --> 01:27:04.393
Jesus Christ,
who I love so much,

01:27:04.433 --> 01:27:05.873
more than anything
in the whole world,

01:27:05.953 --> 01:27:07.993
I am begging you,
please...

01:27:08.073 --> 01:27:10.633
send a hitman to
the United States of America

01:27:10.673 --> 01:27:12.233
to kill Pig Vomit finally.

01:27:12.313 --> 01:27:13.633
Thank you. I love you, God.

01:27:13.713 --> 01:27:15.593
I'll do whatever you say
if you just make that come true.

01:27:16.913 --> 01:27:20.033
# Howard Stern, WNBC #

01:27:20.313 --> 01:27:23.833
So if we bring Robin back,
you'll behave?

01:27:23.913 --> 01:27:26.153
Absolutely.
Robin's my anchor.

01:27:26.193 --> 01:27:27.393
You can't trust him.

01:27:27.473 --> 01:27:28.553
Kenny,
that's not fair.

01:27:28.633 --> 01:27:31.993
And quite frankly,
I'm just a little bit hurt

01:27:32.033 --> 01:27:35.153
that you're so incapable
of being supportive.

01:27:35.233 --> 01:27:39.113
And, Vin, please, if
you hire Robin back,

01:27:39.193 --> 01:27:40.793
I promise you
you won't be sorry.

01:27:40.873 --> 01:27:42.313
You have my word.

01:27:50.633 --> 01:27:51.553
Thank you.

01:27:55.073 --> 01:27:57.113
We hate noise.
Isn't that right, Jerry?

01:27:57.193 --> 01:27:58.633
Yeah. Makes me nuts.

01:27:58.713 --> 01:28:00.153
No, it's
a very quiet street.

01:28:00.193 --> 01:28:01.673
You're gonna like it here.

01:28:02.993 --> 01:28:04.273
Excuse me for a second.

01:28:05.633 --> 01:28:06.953
You're back.
I got you back.

01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:08.073
It's a miracle
of all miracles.

01:28:08.193 --> 01:28:09.433
I can't talk right now.

01:28:09.513 --> 01:28:11.073
Oh, hello.
How are you?

01:28:11.153 --> 01:28:13.193
I even got you an office.
You're all set.

01:28:13.273 --> 01:28:14.633
I'm showing
my apartment now.

01:28:14.713 --> 01:28:16.193
You're looking
at this apartment?

01:28:16.273 --> 01:28:17.913
Let me tell you something.
There are roaches the size of dogs here.

01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:19.433
- I don't advise you living here.
- Excuse me.

01:28:19.513 --> 01:28:21.593
It is disgusting.
Take a look behind the fireplace.

01:28:21.673 --> 01:28:23.713
You'll see. Excuse me.
I'll come back and tell you.

01:28:23.793 --> 01:28:25.913
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

01:28:25.993 --> 01:28:27.873
Robin, you got your job back,
so what's the problem?

01:28:27.953 --> 01:28:29.953
The problem is that
when I needed you,

01:28:30.033 --> 01:28:31.193
you didn't stand
behind me.

01:28:31.273 --> 01:28:32.913
Robin, those guys are assholes.
They screwed you,

01:28:32.993 --> 01:28:35.233
and they screwed me. We gotta
get back in there and beat them.

01:28:35.313 --> 01:28:36.953
We were supposed
to be a team.

01:28:37.033 --> 01:28:38.393
We are a team,
for God's sakes.

01:28:38.433 --> 01:28:39.953
We're gonna be the greatest team
in the history of radio.

01:28:41.273 --> 01:28:42.633
Come on.
What's the big deal?

01:28:42.673 --> 01:28:45.993
Look at me, Robin.
Robin...

01:28:46.073 --> 01:28:46.993
See this?

01:28:47.073 --> 01:28:48.313
Look what I'm doing.

01:28:48.393 --> 01:28:49.553
You know what I'm doing?
I'm begging you.

01:28:49.633 --> 01:28:51.073
I'm begging you.

01:28:51.153 --> 01:28:52.633
I'm serious.

01:28:52.713 --> 01:28:54.073
Come here.
I'm gonna kiss your feet.

01:28:54.113 --> 01:28:55.193
Look at these gams.

01:28:55.273 --> 01:28:56.473
Look at these feet.

01:28:56.513 --> 01:28:58.233
I'm worshipping your foot.

01:28:58.313 --> 01:28:59.553
Look at me, Robin.

01:28:59.633 --> 01:29:00.993
What are you doing?

01:29:01.073 --> 01:29:02.193
People are looking
at us.

01:29:02.273 --> 01:29:04.353
I'm begging you to...
I'm liking it down here.

01:29:04.433 --> 01:29:06.273
Hey, Robin,

01:29:06.353 --> 01:29:08.513
you love this,
don't you?

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:09.753
It gives me
great pleasure now

01:29:09.833 --> 01:29:11.073
to welcome back
on our show

01:29:11.153 --> 01:29:13.593
the very beautiful,
multitalented...

01:29:13.633 --> 01:29:15.913
uh, vivacious...

01:29:15.993 --> 01:29:17.633
tight-sweatered...

01:29:17.713 --> 01:29:20.793
beautifully big-breasted
Robin Quivers. I love her.

01:29:20.873 --> 01:29:22.593
Thank you.

01:29:22.673 --> 01:29:24.833
May I say that you are
beautifully big-breasted again?

01:29:24.913 --> 01:29:26.273
No.

01:29:26.313 --> 01:29:28.753
Thank God you're back,
'cause the show sucked without you.

01:29:28.833 --> 01:29:31.233
Actually, I just want to say
how much I really missed you and...

01:29:31.313 --> 01:29:32.233
Aww.

01:29:32.313 --> 01:29:33.433
That I really do love you,

01:29:33.513 --> 01:29:35.153
and I'm just
so glad you're back.

01:29:35.233 --> 01:29:37.553
OK there, Mr. Rushton,

01:29:37.593 --> 01:29:41.473
You pick up the phone,
and it rings right into my booth.

01:29:41.553 --> 01:29:43.113
Good, but don't
answer it.

01:29:43.193 --> 01:29:45.873
Immediately disconnect
Stern's microphone,

01:29:45.953 --> 01:29:48.073
dump out of the delay,
and go straight to a record.

01:29:48.153 --> 01:29:49.273
That would be it,
sir.

01:29:49.353 --> 01:29:52.433
Always have a record
ready to go.

01:29:52.513 --> 01:29:53.993
Yes, sir.

01:29:56.473 --> 01:29:59.753
This little puppy's finally
gonna get housebroken.

01:29:59.913 --> 01:30:02.073
Oh, look at this, Robin.
This is unbelievable.

01:30:02.113 --> 01:30:03.833
Oh, the underpants
are coming off.

01:30:03.913 --> 01:30:07.153
That is the first naked lady
in the history of radio.

01:30:07.193 --> 01:30:08.793
Sans panties, sans bra.

01:30:08.873 --> 01:30:10.313
I am shocked.

01:30:10.353 --> 01:30:11.793
So am I.
This is disgraceful.

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:12.913
We should be taken
off the air.

01:30:12.993 --> 01:30:14.913
You've finally done it.

01:30:14.993 --> 01:30:17.113
Ohh! Beautiful. You're a work of art.
Did you know that?

01:30:17.193 --> 01:30:18.113
Thank you, Howard.

01:30:18.193 --> 01:30:19.313
Let me tell you
something.

01:30:19.393 --> 01:30:21.673
Now, to ensure our place
in the history of radio,

01:30:21.753 --> 01:30:24.393
Mandy has agreed to actually
get on the floor with me

01:30:24.433 --> 01:30:25.993
and give me a massage
while she is nude.

01:30:26.073 --> 01:30:28.593
What does a massage have to do
with making it into history?

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:30.633
Who knows? I don't know.
Massage, schmas.

01:30:30.673 --> 01:30:31.633
I just gotta
get touched.

01:30:31.673 --> 01:30:32.793
I can't wait, Howard.

01:30:32.873 --> 01:30:33.833
You can't wait?

01:30:33.913 --> 01:30:34.993
Let me tell you something...

01:30:35.073 --> 01:30:37.313
I'm not kidding around...
You are beautiful,

01:30:37.393 --> 01:30:38.833
and my thoughts
are right in the gutter.

01:30:38.913 --> 01:30:40.193
You understand what I mean?

01:30:40.233 --> 01:30:41.433
This is the Tudor,
right?

01:30:41.513 --> 01:30:43.353
Center hall plan,
very traditional.

01:30:43.393 --> 01:30:44.593
Naked Woman: I've been
thinking about you, too.

01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:47.873
Only reason it's for sale
is they're divorcing.

01:30:47.953 --> 01:30:51.793
Would you believe 80%% %
of my listings are from divorces?

01:30:51.833 --> 01:30:53.033
Howard: Mmm.
For God's sakes.

01:30:53.113 --> 01:30:54.473
Now, what do you suggest
we do here?

01:30:54.553 --> 01:30:58.193
Why don't you come lay
over here and get comfortable?

01:30:58.233 --> 01:31:00.033
I could do that.

01:31:00.113 --> 01:31:01.033
All right.

01:31:01.113 --> 01:31:02.473
I can't believe
my luck here.

01:31:02.553 --> 01:31:04.153
Don't hurt yourself
getting over there.

01:31:04.233 --> 01:31:05.153
I won't.

01:31:05.233 --> 01:31:06.353
All right,
hold on a second.

01:31:06.433 --> 01:31:09.033
Let me get
my cans on.

01:31:09.113 --> 01:31:10.033
OK.

01:31:10.113 --> 01:31:11.913
Ooh, you know what?
You know... Oh, man.

01:31:11.993 --> 01:31:12.913
Let me soak you in.

01:31:12.993 --> 01:31:14.193
Holy cow,
are you naked.

01:31:14.273 --> 01:31:15.433
You know what I like
about you?

01:31:15.513 --> 01:31:16.433
What?

01:31:16.513 --> 01:31:17.513
I like that you're
the perfect height.

01:31:17.593 --> 01:31:18.553
I could have sex
with you standing up.

01:31:18.593 --> 01:31:20.233
Look at that. Ooh.

01:31:20.273 --> 01:31:22.993
Robin:
Howard! You're married.

01:31:23.073 --> 01:31:24.593
I am? I mean, I am.

01:31:24.673 --> 01:31:25.953
Well, I'm not really
married anymore.

01:31:25.993 --> 01:31:26.993
What do you mean?

01:31:27.073 --> 01:31:28.393
Take a seat. I'll
Tell you what happened.

01:31:28.473 --> 01:31:30.633
My wife was suffering from cancer...
I never told you this...

01:31:30.713 --> 01:31:31.633
and she died last night.

01:31:31.713 --> 01:31:33.193
I've been single
for exactly 6 hours.

01:31:33.273 --> 01:31:35.073
Honey, if you're
up there now,

01:31:35.153 --> 01:31:37.073
I know you can hear me,
and you're at God's side,

01:31:37.153 --> 01:31:39.433
but I want you to cover
your ears and eyes.

01:31:39.513 --> 01:31:40.993
Besides, you're married
to God now...

01:31:41.113 --> 01:31:43.033
Your husband's
quite a character.

01:31:43.113 --> 01:31:46.673
Only on the radio.
It's just an act.

01:31:46.753 --> 01:31:49.673
Oh, oh, that's nice. No one's ever
touched me like this before.

01:31:49.753 --> 01:31:50.713
Let me ask you
something.

01:31:50.753 --> 01:31:51.913
You have the look
of love in your eyes,

01:31:51.953 --> 01:31:54.153
but I'm an ugly man.
I know this.

01:31:54.233 --> 01:31:55.993
You couldn't be physically
attracted to me, could you?

01:31:56.073 --> 01:31:57.633
Physically, I am.

01:31:57.713 --> 01:32:00.073
I mean, you're smart,
you're sexy.

01:32:00.153 --> 01:32:02.113
Wait. Excuse me
for one minute. Robin...

01:32:02.193 --> 01:32:03.313
I didn't say a thing.

01:32:03.433 --> 01:32:06.393
Robin, go up to the cafeteria
and get some lunch.

01:32:06.473 --> 01:32:07.673
Yeah, go ahead.
Tell me more about me.

01:32:07.753 --> 01:32:08.793
You're funny.

01:32:08.873 --> 01:32:11.633
You know what I would
do to you physically?

01:32:11.673 --> 01:32:12.993
What would you do?

01:32:13.073 --> 01:32:15.033
I don't know what I'd do,
but let me just say something.

01:32:15.113 --> 01:32:17.113
Whatever it is,
it would last 3 seconds.

01:32:17.193 --> 01:32:18.593
3 seconds,
I'd be finished.

01:32:18.673 --> 01:32:21.633
We would have sex, like,
10 times a day. You would love it.

01:32:21.713 --> 01:32:23.913
I kind of want to
wrap my legs around you.

01:32:23.953 --> 01:32:24.913
You do?

01:32:28.313 --> 01:32:30.873
The average radio listener
listens for 18 minutes.

01:32:30.953 --> 01:32:31.913
Mm-hmm.

01:32:31.993 --> 01:32:33.953
The average Howard Stern fan
listens for...

01:32:34.033 --> 01:32:35.233
are you ready for this?

01:32:35.313 --> 01:32:37.153
An hour and 20 minutes.

01:32:37.233 --> 01:32:38.353
How can that be?

01:32:38.433 --> 01:32:39.833
Answer
most commonly given:

01:32:39.913 --> 01:32:42.353
"I want to see
what he'll say next."

01:32:42.433 --> 01:32:43.873
All right, OK, fine.

01:32:43.913 --> 01:32:45.993
But what about the people
who hate Stern?

01:32:46.073 --> 01:32:48.033
Good point.
The average Stern hater...

01:32:48.153 --> 01:32:50.993
listens for
21/2 hours a day.

01:32:53.833 --> 01:32:55.793
Look, but if they hate him,

01:32:55.873 --> 01:32:57.193
why do they listen?

01:32:57.273 --> 01:32:58.313
Most common answer:

01:32:58.353 --> 01:33:00.273
"I want to see
what he'll say next."

01:33:00.353 --> 01:33:02.153
- Kenny.
- Fucking twisted. What?

01:33:02.233 --> 01:33:04.353
You'd better listen to this.

01:33:04.473 --> 01:33:05.953
Howard: This is nice.
You wanna know something?

01:33:05.993 --> 01:33:07.433
This is
the God's honest truth.

01:33:07.513 --> 01:33:08.913
Come here.
I want to tell you closer.

01:33:08.993 --> 01:33:12.393
I am fully aroused right now.
I am totally engorged.

01:33:12.473 --> 01:33:13.353
Oh, my God.

01:33:13.393 --> 01:33:14.633
Naked Woman:
Well, after the show,

01:33:14.713 --> 01:33:17.553
why don't we go some place else
and see how it feels?

01:33:17.633 --> 01:33:19.073
Really? That's great.

01:33:19.193 --> 01:33:20.673
You know why I love you?
'Cause you're smart.

01:33:20.753 --> 01:33:22.993
And you're practically a virgin, right?

01:33:23.073 --> 01:33:24.713
Practically.

01:33:24.793 --> 01:33:27.513
You have a sharp ass.

01:33:27.593 --> 01:33:29.513
I'm gonna be so honest
with you now.

01:33:29.553 --> 01:33:31.193
I've never said this before.

01:33:31.273 --> 01:33:32.993
I'm telling you,
I'm a full 21/2 inches,

01:33:33.073 --> 01:33:35.193
and I've never been 21/2...
What's the music?

01:33:35.273 --> 01:33:36.513
We're off the air.

01:33:36.593 --> 01:33:38.513
Are we off the air?

01:33:38.593 --> 01:33:41.953
Oh. Would you do me a favor?
Just stay right there, OK?

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:43.833
What the hell's going on?
What are you doing, man?

01:33:43.873 --> 01:33:45.473
Look, Rushton told me,
this phone...

01:33:45.553 --> 01:33:48.353
Oh, come on, man.
Don't listen to Kenny.

01:33:48.433 --> 01:33:49.673
I'm just doing what
he told me, that's all.

01:33:49.753 --> 01:33:51.193
Shit, man, you don't
take me off the air

01:33:51.273 --> 01:33:52.233
in the middle
of a fucking bit.

01:33:52.313 --> 01:33:53.313
Come on.
Don't listen to Kenny.

01:33:53.393 --> 01:33:54.433
You're supposed
to listen to me.

01:33:54.513 --> 01:33:55.553
He's the boss.

01:33:55.633 --> 01:33:58.393
Forget it.
You believe this?

01:33:58.433 --> 01:33:59.713
What the hell
are they doing?

01:34:01.833 --> 01:34:02.913
Yeah, hi.
Can I speak to Kenny?

01:34:02.993 --> 01:34:04.953
It's Howard over
in the air studio.

01:34:05.073 --> 01:34:06.033
Just hold the line.

01:34:06.153 --> 01:34:07.113
As soon
as they get him on,

01:34:07.233 --> 01:34:08.153
just keep him on the line.

01:34:08.233 --> 01:34:09.593
Fred, get me back
on the air.

01:34:09.633 --> 01:34:11.833
Just patch the phone call
onto the air, OK?

01:34:11.913 --> 01:34:14.313
Just put it right through
as soon as you can.

01:34:14.393 --> 01:34:15.553
Fuck, man.

01:34:15.633 --> 01:34:19.033
# Oh, the canvas
can do miracles #

01:34:19.073 --> 01:34:20.153
# Just you wait and see... #

01:34:20.233 --> 01:34:21.873
Patch it in.

01:34:21.953 --> 01:34:23.433
I said patch it in!

01:34:27.273 --> 01:34:29.433
Yes, Robin, he's
running in right now.

01:34:29.473 --> 01:34:31.593
Can I have the phone, please,
just for a second?

01:34:31.673 --> 01:34:33.193
Hi, Robin.
We back on the air?

01:34:33.313 --> 01:34:34.473
Robin: Yeah.
Everybody can hear.

01:34:34.553 --> 01:34:36.033
OK, I'm right outside
Pig Vomit's office.

01:34:36.153 --> 01:34:37.233
I'm gonna knock
on his door.

01:34:37.313 --> 01:34:38.233
All right.

01:34:38.313 --> 01:34:39.753
Hey, Pig Vomit.

01:34:39.793 --> 01:34:41.633
Come on, Kenny.
Why don't you open up?

01:34:41.713 --> 01:34:44.033
I want to know why
this guy had to cut my show off.

01:34:44.113 --> 01:34:45.273
Come on, Pig Vomit.

01:34:45.353 --> 01:34:46.553
Mr. Stern,
he's in a meeting.

01:34:46.633 --> 01:34:47.713
I'd like to know
what meeting

01:34:47.793 --> 01:34:48.953
is more important
than my show.

01:34:49.033 --> 01:34:50.313
He took the show
right off the air.

01:34:50.393 --> 01:34:52.673
What'd you take the show
off the air for, Pig Vomit? Huh?

01:34:52.753 --> 01:34:54.353
This isn't funny, Howard.

01:34:54.433 --> 01:34:55.353
Oh, it's not funny?

01:34:55.433 --> 01:34:56.753
What are you
talking about?

01:34:56.833 --> 01:34:57.833
I think
it's very funny.

01:34:57.913 --> 01:34:58.913
How would you know
what's funny, anyway?

01:34:59.033 --> 01:35:01.153
You're not bringing
that in here, Stern.

01:35:01.233 --> 01:35:02.873
I don't see anybody
in here in a meeting, do you?

01:35:02.913 --> 01:35:03.873
You gotta go.

01:35:03.913 --> 01:35:04.873
Why would I have to go?

01:35:04.913 --> 01:35:06.473
Why don't you explain
to my audience

01:35:06.593 --> 01:35:07.553
why you had to
shut down the show?

01:35:07.673 --> 01:35:09.153
I don't answer
to you, Stern.

01:35:09.273 --> 01:35:10.953
Yes, you do,
you big idiot scumbag.

01:35:11.033 --> 01:35:13.153
I'm your boss.
I'm your boss.

01:35:13.233 --> 01:35:14.233
Hey, what's this?

01:35:14.353 --> 01:35:17.033
Robin, it's everybody's
salary on his desk.

01:35:17.113 --> 01:35:18.393
God damn it,
get out of here!

01:35:18.433 --> 01:35:20.113
He hit me, Robin.
He's hitting me.

01:35:20.193 --> 01:35:21.113
Robin: Hit him back.

01:35:21.193 --> 01:35:23.073
I'm gonna
hit you back.

01:35:23.153 --> 01:35:24.953
I hit him back.
He hit...

01:35:25.033 --> 01:35:26.433
You're not getting
the phone from me, Kenny.

01:35:26.473 --> 01:35:27.433
Gimme the damn phone.

01:35:27.473 --> 01:35:28.473
No!

01:35:28.513 --> 01:35:29.473
Oh!

01:35:29.513 --> 01:35:30.713
Oh, my God, Robin.

01:35:30.793 --> 01:35:32.953
Kenny just hit himself
in the face. He's bleeding.

01:35:33.033 --> 01:35:33.993
Give that to me.

01:35:34.073 --> 01:35:35.433
Hey, come on.

01:35:35.513 --> 01:35:36.473
Oh!

01:35:36.513 --> 01:35:38.033
Robin: Oh, goodness,
what's going on?

01:35:38.113 --> 01:35:39.433
Vince just got hit
by Kenny.

01:35:39.513 --> 01:35:40.633
God damn it, Stern!

01:35:40.713 --> 01:35:43.033
You look! See that?!
Blood, Stern!

01:35:43.113 --> 01:35:44.793
- Are you OK?
- No!

01:35:44.873 --> 01:35:45.793
Broke my nose!

01:35:45.873 --> 01:35:47.153
It wasn't my fault.

01:35:47.193 --> 01:35:48.233
I'll sue your ass!

01:35:48.353 --> 01:35:49.313
Get out of here!

01:35:51.233 --> 01:35:52.193
Our first guest tonight

01:35:52.273 --> 01:35:54.833
is the afternoon
drive-time disc jockey

01:35:54.913 --> 01:35:57.473
at WNBC radio
here in New York City.

01:35:57.553 --> 01:35:58.673
Ladies and gentlemen,
do me a favor.

01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:01.233
Please welcome Howard Stern.

01:36:01.353 --> 01:36:02.273
Howard!

01:36:09.913 --> 01:36:11.673
Walk over there
and have a seat.

01:36:11.713 --> 01:36:15.113
Now, uh, Howard,
you know, uh...

01:36:15.193 --> 01:36:17.033
I admire you, you know?
I love what you do.

01:36:17.113 --> 01:36:18.313
I think
you're a pioneer.

01:36:18.353 --> 01:36:20.033
You're on the cutting edge
of radio entertainment.

01:36:20.113 --> 01:36:22.433
You and I both work
for NBC.

01:36:22.513 --> 01:36:23.473
You have
the radio show,

01:36:23.593 --> 01:36:25.153
I have the little
TV show here.

01:36:25.233 --> 01:36:27.033
How do you get along
with the folks here?

01:36:27.113 --> 01:36:28.193
You enjoying
the experience?

01:36:28.273 --> 01:36:29.673
I hate it at NBC, Dave.

01:36:29.753 --> 01:36:32.073
It's the worst. It sucks.
I gotta tell you something.

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:33.433
All the management at NBC...

01:36:33.513 --> 01:36:36.113
bunch of creeps, and I'm not
afraid to say it right now,

01:36:36.193 --> 01:36:37.833
and, you know,
it's funny,

01:36:37.913 --> 01:36:40.473
because I know you feel
the same exact way I do about NBC

01:36:40.553 --> 01:36:42.433
because you told me on the phone
personally last week

01:36:42.513 --> 01:36:43.473
that you feel
the same way.

01:36:43.553 --> 01:36:45.713
I couldn't be happier.
Everything is fine.

01:36:45.793 --> 01:36:47.193
I don't understand
them at all.

01:36:47.273 --> 01:36:49.513
Now, Howard, let's get back to
the issue of them being creepy.

01:36:49.553 --> 01:36:51.073
Now, when you say
they're creep...

01:36:53.153 --> 01:36:55.073
He makes us sound like
a bunch of idiots on the radio.

01:36:55.153 --> 01:36:57.073
He criticizes us
on television.

01:36:57.153 --> 01:36:59.393
I thought you were going
to control this guy.

01:36:59.433 --> 01:37:01.273
Oh, well,
we are, sir.

01:37:01.353 --> 01:37:04.633
In fact, we're designing
a more restrictive program

01:37:04.673 --> 01:37:05.953
- Shut up.
- To make sure...

01:37:06.033 --> 01:37:07.473
How are his numbers?

01:37:07.593 --> 01:37:10.473
The official ratings don't
come out until tomorrow,

01:37:10.553 --> 01:37:11.793
but we've got
some projections.

01:37:14.233 --> 01:37:17.313
Stern... has gone...

01:37:17.393 --> 01:37:21.353
from a 2.9 to a 5.6.

01:37:24.433 --> 01:37:27.473
He's number one
in the market.

01:37:27.553 --> 01:37:29.113
He's the hottest DJ in New York.

01:37:30.713 --> 01:37:33.113
Kind of weird,
you know?

01:37:33.193 --> 01:37:34.993
I thought there was
a mistake or something,

01:37:35.073 --> 01:37:38.713
but...
mm-mmm... no.

01:37:38.793 --> 01:37:42.673
My girlfriends think I'm crazy for
letting you behave like that on the air.

01:37:42.713 --> 01:37:44.673
What are you
talking about?

01:37:44.713 --> 01:37:46.153
You know what it is?
It's those yentas you hang around with.

01:37:46.233 --> 01:37:47.673
They're... they're
driving you crazy.

01:37:47.713 --> 01:37:49.353
It's not yentas, Howard.
It's everybody.

01:37:49.433 --> 01:37:51.353
I can't even go... I can't
even get my hair done.

01:37:51.433 --> 01:37:52.913
I can't even walk in
and get my hair done

01:37:52.993 --> 01:37:55.313
without people looking at me like,
"Oh, God, that poor little thing."

01:37:55.393 --> 01:37:56.593
Then you know
what you gotta do?

01:37:56.673 --> 01:37:57.713
You gotta go to a different
hair shop or something.

01:37:57.753 --> 01:37:59.153
- Please!
- For God's sakes,

01:37:59.233 --> 01:38:00.753
If the place is driving
you crazy, don't go there.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:02.273
It's not that!
It's not that!

01:38:02.353 --> 01:38:03.513
God, no wonder they think
you're sleeping around!

01:38:03.593 --> 01:38:04.753
Look at me!
Look at me!

01:38:04.793 --> 01:38:06.273
- I'm disgusting!
- What about you?

01:38:06.353 --> 01:38:08.993
- You're not disgusting.
- Yes, I am! I look like a house!

01:38:09.073 --> 01:38:10.793
- I look like an elephant!
- You don't look like a house.

01:38:10.873 --> 01:38:12.593
- You do not. You look beautiful.
- I look like Babar!

01:38:12.633 --> 01:38:14.233
- You don't look like an elephant.
- I do.

01:38:14.313 --> 01:38:16.753
You don't look like Babar.
You look gorgeous.

01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:18.193
This is the most beautiful
you ever looked.

01:38:18.273 --> 01:38:19.433
You're carrying our baby.

01:38:19.513 --> 01:38:21.873
Come over here. You want to
sit down on this couch?

01:38:21.913 --> 01:38:23.873
You know what the problem is?
You're tired.

01:38:23.913 --> 01:38:25.073
I am tired.

01:38:25.113 --> 01:38:26.193
Here.

01:38:32.073 --> 01:38:33.353
Look at this...

01:38:33.433 --> 01:38:35.033
It's our baby.

01:38:36.593 --> 01:38:38.073
It's beautiful.

01:38:38.153 --> 01:38:39.993
You're beautiful.

01:38:40.073 --> 01:38:41.833
Beautiful.

01:38:47.273 --> 01:38:48.233
Who would come here?

01:38:48.273 --> 01:38:49.353
Quiet.

01:38:54.313 --> 01:38:55.313
I don't want
to get that.

01:38:55.393 --> 01:38:56.913
Oh.

01:38:56.993 --> 01:38:58.433
OK. I'll go
get the door.

01:38:58.513 --> 01:39:00.873
Don't go away.

01:39:06.233 --> 01:39:07.153
Howdy, partner.

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:08.513
- How you doing?
- Oh, hey, Kenny.

01:39:08.593 --> 01:39:10.073
Can I come in
just for a second?

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:11.273
It's kind of
a bad time, OK?

01:39:11.353 --> 01:39:13.233
Just real quick, OK?
Listen.

01:39:13.313 --> 01:39:14.553
I want to tell you
something.

01:39:14.633 --> 01:39:16.073
You've won.

01:39:16.153 --> 01:39:17.713
When the new ratings
come out tomorrow,

01:39:17.793 --> 01:39:19.433
you are going
to be number one.

01:39:19.513 --> 01:39:22.153
You understand me? A point
and a half higher than Imus.

01:39:22.233 --> 01:39:23.833
- No shit?
- You've killed him. You've slayed him.

01:39:23.913 --> 01:39:25.033
You understand me?
Ha ha!

01:39:25.073 --> 01:39:26.073
That's great news.
Thanks, Kenny. I gotta go.

01:39:26.153 --> 01:39:27.393
Howard!
Howard! Howard!

01:39:27.473 --> 01:39:31.353
Listen, I know I've been
a real pain in the butt, OK?

01:39:31.433 --> 01:39:32.833
But that's
all over with now.

01:39:32.913 --> 01:39:34.833
Now, you're going to need
a friend on the inside.

01:39:34.913 --> 01:39:36.553
I'm going to do
everything I can for you.

01:39:36.633 --> 01:39:39.553
All right?
How's that sound, partner?

01:39:41.193 --> 01:39:42.153
Fuck you.

01:39:44.553 --> 01:39:46.393
People of New York...

01:39:46.433 --> 01:39:48.233
People of Earth...

01:39:48.313 --> 01:39:49.913
we are gathered here today

01:39:49.993 --> 01:39:51.513
in praise of me!

01:39:54.273 --> 01:39:57.513
Man, this is
a great day in my life.

01:39:57.593 --> 01:39:59.993
I've been dreaming
of this day forever.

01:40:00.073 --> 01:40:01.633
Thank you!

01:40:01.713 --> 01:40:03.793
Thanks.

01:40:03.873 --> 01:40:05.953
You know,
when I got to NBC,

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:08.073
they treated me
like I was a jerk.

01:40:08.153 --> 01:40:11.553
They did everything to
sabotage me, but because of you...

01:40:13.113 --> 01:40:15.633
Because of you,
and only because of you,

01:40:15.713 --> 01:40:18.113
I am now the number one
disc jockey in New York,

01:40:18.193 --> 01:40:19.873
and I thank you.
I love you for that.

01:40:19.953 --> 01:40:20.873
I love you!

01:40:20.953 --> 01:40:23.833
Thank you!

01:40:23.873 --> 01:40:25.473
This is my gift to you,
New York...

01:40:25.553 --> 01:40:27.393
AC/DC!

01:40:44.873 --> 01:40:46.753
# She was a fast machine #

01:40:46.793 --> 01:40:49.073
# She kept
her motor clean #

01:40:49.153 --> 01:40:52.393
# She was the best damn
woman that I've ever seen #

01:40:52.473 --> 01:40:54.713
# She had the sexiest eyes #

01:40:54.793 --> 01:40:56.233
# Telling me no lies #

01:40:56.313 --> 01:41:00.193
# Knockin' me out
with those American thighs #

01:41:00.273 --> 01:41:01.873
# We did not
want to share... #

01:41:01.953 --> 01:41:04.633
How!
My water broke!

01:41:04.713 --> 01:41:05.673
What?

01:41:05.713 --> 01:41:07.833
My water broke!

01:41:07.913 --> 01:41:10.033
# Bang, the walls
started shakin' #

01:41:10.113 --> 01:41:12.033
# The earth was quakin' #

01:41:12.113 --> 01:41:14.113
# My mind was achin' #

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:16.273
# We were makin' when you #

01:41:16.353 --> 01:41:19.953
# Shook me all night long #

01:41:20.033 --> 01:41:22.953
Hey! Hey!

01:41:22.993 --> 01:41:28.033
# Yeah, you shook me
all night long... #

01:41:29.633 --> 01:41:30.873
Keep it moving!

01:41:30.953 --> 01:41:33.593
# One more time,
and when she got to... #

01:41:44.393 --> 01:41:47.273
Hoowww!

01:41:47.353 --> 01:41:48.313
Now, push! Push!

01:41:48.353 --> 01:41:50.753
No, no, don't push.
Just breathe deeply.

01:41:50.833 --> 01:41:51.753
Don't push, honey.

01:41:51.833 --> 01:41:52.753
Ice chips.

01:41:52.833 --> 01:41:54.153
Fuck ice chips,
How!

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:56.113
Listen to me...

01:41:56.393 --> 01:41:59.193
we named her Emily.
7 pounds, 8 ounces.

01:41:59.273 --> 01:42:01.593
She was incredibly
beautiful. Really nice.

01:42:01.633 --> 01:42:02.953
Well, you must
have felt fabulous.

01:42:03.033 --> 01:42:05.753
Yeah, I had everything I ever
wanted in life, you know.

01:42:05.833 --> 01:42:06.833
You know,
I have to admit

01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:09.713
that I'm really not
a very big fan of yours,

01:42:09.793 --> 01:42:11.153
but, in fact, I...

01:42:11.233 --> 01:42:14.073
I know. You thought I was
a disgusting, sexist, racist pig

01:42:14.113 --> 01:42:16.993
who had the maturity level
of a 3-year-old, right?

01:42:17.073 --> 01:42:18.073
Yeah, exactly.

01:42:18.153 --> 01:42:19.793
Yeah. I get that
all the time.

01:42:19.873 --> 01:42:22.153
But then you know
what happens?

01:42:22.233 --> 01:42:23.273
What?

01:42:23.353 --> 01:42:25.393
I grow on you
like a fungus.

01:42:27.593 --> 01:42:28.953
I could see that.

01:42:32.593 --> 01:42:35.033
You know, I have
to tell you...

01:42:35.113 --> 01:42:37.753
this has been
a really great flight.

01:42:37.833 --> 01:42:39.433
Really?

01:42:39.513 --> 01:42:40.913
Mm-hmm.

01:42:43.233 --> 01:42:45.153
You know, I could
get this girl.

01:42:45.233 --> 01:42:46.393
I know I could get her.

01:42:46.473 --> 01:42:48.393
And this is the hell
that's my life.

01:42:48.473 --> 01:42:49.913
I mean, think about it.

01:42:49.953 --> 01:42:51.593
What would it be like
to have sex with her?

01:42:51.673 --> 01:42:52.993
It would be amazing.

01:42:53.073 --> 01:42:55.313
But I'm not going
to act on it.

01:42:55.353 --> 01:42:56.873
You know why?

01:42:56.953 --> 01:42:58.273
Because I'd be a schmuck.

01:42:58.353 --> 01:43:00.593
No, because
I love Alison.

01:43:00.673 --> 01:43:04.113
She stuck with me through
the whole thing, you know?

01:43:04.193 --> 01:43:05.993
You gotta respect that.

01:43:06.073 --> 01:43:08.353
I think you have
to respect that.

01:43:12.873 --> 01:43:15.193
You have to
respect that.

01:43:20.073 --> 01:43:21.033
Hey, everybody!

01:43:21.113 --> 01:43:22.353
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

01:43:22.433 --> 01:43:24.073
Oh, did I miss you!

01:43:24.113 --> 01:43:26.753
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.873
Let's go say hi to Mommy.
Come on.

01:43:28.953 --> 01:43:30.353
- Hi.
- Wait, wait. There we go.

01:43:30.433 --> 01:43:31.633
Did you miss me?
Mmm!

01:43:31.713 --> 01:43:33.633
Hi, honey.
I missed you.

01:43:33.713 --> 01:43:34.633
Oh, Gloria.

01:43:34.713 --> 01:43:36.753
Honey, Gloria.
Gloria, honey.

01:43:36.833 --> 01:43:37.913
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:43:37.993 --> 01:43:39.553
Maybe the two of you
would like to have

01:43:39.633 --> 01:43:41.553
a little menage a trois
tonight?

01:43:41.633 --> 01:43:43.193
Huh. You know what?
Maybe some other time.

01:43:43.233 --> 01:43:44.193
Just, you know,
trying.

01:43:44.233 --> 01:43:45.193
Yeah, I know.

01:43:45.233 --> 01:43:46.793
OK. See you,
Gloria.

01:43:46.873 --> 01:43:49.713
Howard: So occasionally I make
a fool of myself in public,

01:43:49.793 --> 01:43:51.673
and the FCC
wants me off the air,

01:43:51.753 --> 01:43:54.753
and every fundamentalist group
in this country hates my guts,

01:43:54.833 --> 01:43:58.273
and, yeah, most of the things
I do are misunderstood.

01:43:58.313 --> 01:44:00.273
Hey, after all,
being misunderstood

01:44:00.313 --> 01:44:02.753
is the fate of all
true geniuses, is it not?

01:44:02.833 --> 01:44:04.513
But my life
isn't bad at all.

01:44:04.593 --> 01:44:06.553
I'm still on the air,

01:44:06.593 --> 01:44:08.273
I've got my kids,

01:44:08.353 --> 01:44:09.793
and I've got Alison.

01:44:09.833 --> 01:44:12.593
Alison... She's the best friend
I could ever have.

01:44:12.673 --> 01:44:13.753
And who knows?

01:44:13.833 --> 01:44:15.273
With a little time,

01:44:15.353 --> 01:44:16.793
the right energy...

01:44:16.833 --> 01:44:19.473
I think I could talk her
into some hot lesbo action.

01:44:21.073 --> 01:44:22.873
Porno For Pyros:
# Got my hands into something #

01:44:22.953 --> 01:44:25.033
# I could not touch... #

01:44:25.113 --> 01:44:27.273
Stuttering John:
Wait! Wait! Is that it?

01:44:27.353 --> 01:44:28.393
What, the movie's over?

01:44:28.473 --> 01:44:29.593
Oh, yeah?
That's bullshit!

01:44:29.673 --> 01:44:32.273
Hi. You know who I am?
Yeah, I'm Stuttering John.

01:44:32.313 --> 01:44:33.713
And you know why I'm pissed?
I'll tell you why.

01:44:33.793 --> 01:44:36.313
I've been getting up at 5:00
every morning to work for Howard.

01:44:36.393 --> 01:44:37.833
I've been pissing off
every publicist,

01:44:37.913 --> 01:44:39.553
burning every freakin'
bridge in the industry,

01:44:39.633 --> 01:44:43.073
And y-y-you'd figure Howard would pay
me back by putting me in his movie!

01:44:43.193 --> 01:44:44.673
No, he doesn't!
I'm not in the movie!

01:44:44.753 --> 01:44:46.833
I've been in here for 8 years,
cuttin' his friggin' potato!

01:44:46.913 --> 01:44:48.993
I've been smacked around
by Morton Downey,

01:44:49.073 --> 01:44:51.033
punched in the nose by Raquel Welch,
and what do I get?

01:44:51.073 --> 01:44:52.473
I get fucking nothing!
That's what I get!

01:44:52.553 --> 01:44:53.593
I'm not even in
this fucking movie!

01:44:53.673 --> 01:44:54.753
He's says I'll
be in the sequel!

01:44:54.833 --> 01:44:56.553
Yeah? What sequel?
Suppose the movie sucks?

01:44:56.633 --> 01:44:58.473
Th-th-th-there won't
even be any sequel!

01:44:58.513 --> 01:45:01.993
# If you lie for your breakfast,
then you won't get lunch #

01:45:02.073 --> 01:45:05.833
# I'm a hard charger #

01:45:05.913 --> 01:45:07.793
# I don't believe in dying #

01:45:07.873 --> 01:45:09.953
# No such luck #

01:45:10.033 --> 01:45:13.633
# Hard charger #

01:45:13.713 --> 01:45:17.393
# Can't stay pretty
'cause it's just no fun #

01:45:17.473 --> 01:45:19.993
# Hard charger... #

01:45:22.033 --> 01:45:24.513

01:46:04.033 --> 01:46:05.513
It's me!

01:46:18.313 --> 01:46:20.113
Howard:
# I'm a radio star #

01:46:20.153 --> 01:46:22.313
# A hit on TV #

01:46:22.393 --> 01:46:24.153
# My life is on film #

01:46:24.273 --> 01:46:26.193
# Yet it sucks bein' me #

01:46:26.273 --> 01:46:27.793
Ben: Shut up! Sit down!

01:46:27.873 --> 01:46:29.793
# My life's a wreck #

01:46:29.833 --> 01:46:32.073
# I'm bored with sex #

01:46:32.153 --> 01:46:36.673
# I've got a big nose
and a skinny neck #

01:46:36.753 --> 01:46:38.833
# I can't sing #

01:46:38.873 --> 01:46:40.833
# I can't dance #

01:46:40.913 --> 01:46:44.473
# I make money talking about
the joke in my underpants #

01:46:44.553 --> 01:46:46.193
# I'm a tortured man #

01:46:46.273 --> 01:46:47.193
Shut up! Sit down!

01:46:47.273 --> 01:46:48.473
# I'm a tortured man #

01:46:48.553 --> 01:46:50.193
I told you not to be
stupid, you moron.

01:46:50.313 --> 01:46:51.553
Howard: I'm just
thinking for a minute.

01:46:51.633 --> 01:46:54.473
Should I trade half my money
for 10 times as much sex?

01:46:54.553 --> 01:46:55.913
It's an equation
from hell.

01:46:55.993 --> 01:46:56.913
Ray: Oh, well!

01:46:56.993 --> 01:46:58.113
It's an equation
from hell.

01:46:58.193 --> 01:46:59.113
Oh, well!

01:46:59.193 --> 01:47:00.353
It's an equation
from hell.

01:47:00.393 --> 01:47:01.793
Oh, well!

01:47:01.833 --> 01:47:05.393
Marilyn Manson:
# Your mouth is like a suicide #

01:47:05.473 --> 01:47:08.233
# Talkin' like
you never doubt #

01:47:08.313 --> 01:47:10.153
# Melting me down #

01:47:10.233 --> 01:47:13.913
# And suck, suck,
sucking my brain #

01:47:13.993 --> 01:47:19.713
# But I can't be the one
that you need, yeah #

01:47:19.793 --> 01:47:21.113
# And I can't be the... #

01:47:21.193 --> 01:47:23.993
I bear no grudge
against Howard Stern.

01:47:24.073 --> 01:47:26.833
He's been very successful,
and God bless him.

01:47:26.913 --> 01:47:28.353
God bless him.

01:47:28.393 --> 01:47:29.433
But I'll tell you
something,

01:47:29.513 --> 01:47:31.233
I ain't done
too badly myself.

01:47:31.353 --> 01:47:33.993
Uh, I manage
a shopping mall

01:47:34.073 --> 01:47:35.673
down in
Florence, Alabama.

01:47:35.753 --> 01:47:38.833
Yeah. It's the number one
mall in Colbert County,

01:47:38.913 --> 01:47:40.913
and it's number 4
in the state,

01:47:40.993 --> 01:47:42.753
So, it's not
too bad, you know?

01:47:42.833 --> 01:47:47.193
Uh, I play golf
several times a week, you know?

01:47:47.273 --> 01:47:50.233
Uh, but
I'll tell you,

01:47:50.313 --> 01:47:53.393
if Howard would have
listened to me,

01:47:53.473 --> 01:47:57.113
I'd still be
up there in radio.

01:47:57.153 --> 01:47:59.273
Still be doing
radio, you know.

01:48:01.393 --> 01:48:02.553
How about that?

01:48:06.233 --> 01:48:09.113
That goddamn motherfucker,
you know?

01:48:10.513 --> 01:48:13.273
I tried every fucking thing
I could fucking think of

01:48:13.393 --> 01:48:15.673
to mold him into a proper kind of DJ,

01:48:15.753 --> 01:48:18.513
but that goddamn son of a bitch...

01:48:20.393 --> 01:48:22.833
I'll tell you...
Howard Stern, man.

01:48:22.913 --> 01:48:27.793
That motherfuckin'...

01:48:27.873 --> 01:48:31.153
And I'll say that
with no shame either!

01:48:31.233 --> 01:48:33.833
Man's a...

01:48:33.913 --> 01:48:35.913
Foul-mouthed,
immature...

01:48:35.993 --> 01:48:37.833
the man's immature,
you know?

01:48:37.913 --> 01:48:41.833
He's like a... child.

01:48:41.873 --> 01:48:43.313
I'll tell you
this much.

01:48:43.393 --> 01:48:46.633
There ain't no God while
Howard Stern's walking the earth,

01:48:46.673 --> 01:48:47.793
I'll tell you that.

01:48:47.873 --> 01:48:48.873
I gotta go.

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:55.833
How about that?
Howard Stern, huh?

01:48:57.313 --> 01:49:00.193
Howard Stern can
kiss my ass in hell!
