00:53.520 --> 00:56.512
You're just having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.354
That's all it was.

00:59.426 --> 01:03.385
Bad dreams make you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

01:04.765 --> 01:08.257
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

01:08.368 --> 01:11.735
I close my eyes and I think of
something nice.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.205
Like being
here with you.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.596
Hurry up, sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.082
Shit.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.810
Jack?

03:01.181 --> 03:03.046
Did you see someone
ring my doorbell?

03:03.150 --> 03:04.674
No.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.718
Okay, thanks.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.316
I cleaned everything away, sweetheart.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.155
Everything is exactly
the way it was before.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.856
They're clean and shiny. Look.
Look. You see?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.723
Okay, all right.
Just close your eyes.

04:29.736 --> 04:31.704
Well, hello, sailor.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.898
Hi!

04:32.973 --> 04:34.406
Permission to come aboard?

04:34.474 --> 04:37.966
Honey, hold this.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.774
So sorry we couldn't make it yesterday.
Somebody was working late again.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.278
How're you doing, Sal?

04:45.385 --> 04:46.875
I'm good.
How are you?

04:46.953 --> 04:49.387
I'm all right.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.718
Look at you.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.758
Do you like it?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.224
You look great.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.227
Really? I just
kinda threw it on.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.263
She's had outfits
laid out for a week.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.924
You're such a liar.
You know my husband.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.400
I don't listen to what he says.
You know that.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.302
I brought my really good friend,
Heather. She's so nice.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.999
Promise me
you'll be attentive.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.410
How're you doing, man?

05:12.479 --> 05:14.242
She's not to bring anyone.

05:14.347 --> 05:18.511
You don't like her? Believe me,
she's the best looking of Sally's friends.

05:18.618 --> 05:21.678
Which it doesn't say much.

05:21.788 --> 05:23.813
I asked you not to.

05:23.957 --> 05:27.620
You're living on a boat with an 18-year
old boy and you're saying no girls.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.792
Greg, this is Heather.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.799
She's a very good friend of mine, and I just
thought you guys should meet.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.336
Hi.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.664
Can you just excuse me
for a moment?

05:44.211 --> 05:46.941
Jess. You okay?

05:47.013 --> 05:49.777
I don't think so.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.614
Hey. What happened?

05:55.322 --> 05:58.621
Hey. What's the matter?

05:58.692 --> 05:59.852
I'm sorry.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.155
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.992
What is it?
Are you okay?

06:04.064 --> 06:06.032
I'm just tired.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.363
Well, listen, we don't have to go today
if you don't want to.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.461
No, we do. I-I wanna go.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.200
You sure?

06:18.144 --> 06:19.702
Yeah.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.912
Yeah.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.848
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Come up here.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.880
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.722
This is Heather, Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.695
So let's go sailing!

06:37.764 --> 06:39.061
Okay.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.756
Hey.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.490
You okay?

08:19.265 --> 08:20.630
Is Greg okay?

08:20.700 --> 08:22.600
He's fine.
He's upstairs.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.864
You've been asleep
for a couple of hours.

08:24.971 --> 08:27.269
I had this terrible dream.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.705
What about?

08:28.808 --> 08:30.935
I don't remember.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.706
I wouldn't worry.

08:32.812 --> 08:36.043
Apparently bad dreams cure you
of real life stress.

08:36.149 --> 08:40.142
As indeed does champagne.
You want some?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.188
Yeah.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.215
Downey, wanna give me
a hand, please?

08:46.326 --> 08:50.456
Actually, Victor, I'm a guest of
the Captain's, but yes, I witt help you.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.624
Victor, what was that
back there at the harbor?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.133
What?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.999
I asked Jess if she was all right
and you said no.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.562
You told me she was bringing
the little boy along.

09:00.673 --> 09:04.473
When I was walking with her
in the harbor I asked where he was.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.569
She couldn't remember.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.738
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

09:08.848 --> 09:10.873
and then she said
he's at school.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.043
So?

09:13.153 --> 09:16.179
Well, it's Saturday.
Ain't no school today.

09:16.256 --> 09:20.022
Her son goes to a special needs school
and it's open every day.

09:21.327 --> 09:23.386
Be nice to her.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.761
All right.

09:26.866 --> 09:29.096
Do you boys
sunbathe together?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.830
Sometimes.

09:31.905 --> 09:36.342
The champagne is not great
but it is cold. Want some?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.376
No thanks.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.344
Okay, more for me.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.676
Hey, how are you feeling?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.842
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize how tired I was.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.376
You apologize one more time,
and I'm gonna throw you overboard.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.858
Here.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.188
You all right?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.921
Yeah.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.933
He thinks we're a fishing hoat.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.309
He's gonna go hungry.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.207
You want to steer?

10:18.284 --> 10:19.751
Nah.

10:19.819 --> 10:22.447
Go on.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.559
Which way do I aim?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.618
You're gonna aim that way.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.959
It's easy, right?

10:36.803 --> 10:39.067
So, she's a waitress
at some diner.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.733
At least there they talk.
They became friends.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.901
Oh, and she has
an autistic son.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.274
So they're just friends.

10:45.345 --> 10:46.937
Sally!

10:47.013 --> 10:49.743
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry she has a retarded son?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.477
Yeah!

10:51.618 --> 10:54.951
Well, I'm sorry. You know, that's not
Greg's problem, that's hers.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.852
What is it, is it the shorts?

10:56.956 --> 10:59.925
No! Heather, Greg's been my friend
for a really long time.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.518
I can't just sit back and watch him
get shaken down.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.119
She isn't doing that.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.758
Well, I hope not because Greg is
far too trusting.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.802
I'm kinda linking the boy.

11:09.869 --> 11:13.100
Uh, no, you're not. Can you please
go up there and talk to Greg?

11:13.173 --> 11:16.142
I really think the two of you will
be perfect for each other.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.508
And I really don't like
seeing him with her.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.841
Jess, are you ready?

11:22.949 --> 11:25.008
Yeah, let her go.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.618
Yeah.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.190
Woo!

11:39.199 --> 11:40.996
So, how do you know everyone?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.058
Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.296
He got in troubte at home.
He had to get away.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.839
I found him sleeping behind
the store at the harbor.

11:47.907 --> 11:51.968
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.876
Just like that
you let him move in?

11:53.980 --> 11:56.847
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.646
And Downey, I've known him
since I was a kid.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.483
Sally, his wife, I know her from
high school.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.080
I dated her for like four days
in the eighth grade,

12:05.191 --> 12:08.592
so technically
she's my ex.

12:08.695 --> 12:10.356
They seem really nice.

12:10.430 --> 12:14.491
Yeah. Except for the fact that
every year they feel obliged

12:14.567 --> 12:17.934
to bring me an eligible girl.

12:18.037 --> 12:20.232
Maybe they think you're lonely.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.331
Do I give off lonely to you?

12:22.408 --> 12:24.103
Sometimes.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.907
When I come to see you at the diner,
I'm not lonely, I'm hungry.

12:29.115 --> 12:32.243
Obviously yesterday was different.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.717
What happened yesterday?

12:33.786 --> 12:36.516
Yesterday I was not hungry.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.353
I came in with the sole purpose
of inviting you sailing.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.791
You did?

12:41.894 --> 12:43.589
I did.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.861
Turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.928
Let me check it
forjust a sec.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.045
So, things are
okay with Tommy?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.048
The same.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.879
Every day is the same.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.749
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

13:07.820 --> 13:11.483
If I do one thing
differently, I lose him.

13:13.126 --> 13:17.222
What's the matter? I've never seen you
like this before.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.324
I don't know. I just, uh, I just
feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.299
That's because
you're a good mother.

13:23.403 --> 13:27.339
But you can't be everywhere
all of the times.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.965
Hey, guys. Oh!

13:30.076 --> 13:32.067
How is it going?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.113
We're good.

13:34.180 --> 13:39.015
I was just wondering if I could steal
Jess away from you.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.177
Salty's dying
to tatk to her.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.085
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.182
No, no, it's okay.
I-I should circulate.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.525
Hey, just for the record,

13:52.632 --> 13:55.795
I'm not interested.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.110
Yo, what the fuck?

14:15.888 --> 14:17.651
Wind's dropped down on us.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.217
It's not dropped,
it's gone.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.164
This is crazy.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.169
You ever seen this before?

14:31.237 --> 14:34.695
Yeah, yeah. Just not
quite so sudden.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.033
Are we okay to get home?
There is no wind.

14:38.144 --> 14:40.635
Yeah, yeah. We got an engine.
It's not a problem.

14:40.713 --> 14:44.205
It's just, it's weird.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.182
Greg?

14:47.353 --> 14:49.082
Is that normal?

15:14.747 --> 15:17.443
Okay, I'm fucking freaked,
what the fuck.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.295
Triangle to coast guard. Over.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.464
Triangle to coast guard. Over.

15:44.977 --> 15:46.968
Coast guard, go ahead. Over.

15:47.113 --> 15:51.573
We've just gone from seven knots to absolute
zero. You've got anything unusual? Over?

15:51.651 --> 15:54.449
Nothing showing up. Over.

15:54.554 --> 15:59.457
It's darkening up pretty quick out here.
Looks like an electrical storm. Over.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.926
Help me. Please.
Can you hear me?

16:02.995 --> 16:05.657
Help me.
Please, help me.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.758
Killing everyone. They're
dead. They're all dead.

16:09.836 --> 16:13.237
We hear you. What's your
position? Over.

16:15.641 --> 16:19.304
Distressed caller, we hear you.
What are your coordinates? Over.

16:21.347 --> 16:25.181
Coast guard, did you hear a distress call?
We're not getting it anymore. Over.

16:25.318 --> 16:30.119
Distressed caller, make another
transmission. What is your position?

16:30.189 --> 16:32.282
Greg?

16:49.141 --> 16:51.939
Get below deck now.
Get the life jackets.

17:20.406 --> 17:23.239
Out it. Out the sail.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.973
Vic, get the main sail down.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.016
Get it down.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.855
Vic!

17:37.924 --> 17:39.687
No!

17:53.673 --> 17:55.334
Get back.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.571
Jess, take my hand.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.010
Grab on.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.446
Heather!

18:08.454 --> 18:10.752
Grab on.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.598
Heather!

18:25.304 --> 18:26.771
Vic!

18:54.834 --> 18:56.734
Jess.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.470
Are you okay?

19:05.578 --> 19:07.136
All right.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.275
Downey?

19:12.985 --> 19:14.509
Are you guys okay?

19:14.620 --> 19:17.145
Have you seen Heather?
She got lost through the window.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.484
No. Come on, come on.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.650
Heather!

19:23.529 --> 19:25.497
Heather!

19:27.299 --> 19:29.961
Greg! Help me!

19:30.036 --> 19:32.334
Sally. Sally.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.770
Just give me your hand.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.831
Heather!

20:05.538 --> 20:06.732
Are you guys okay?

20:06.839 --> 20:08.204
Yeah.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.377
Are you all right?

20:20.519 --> 20:22.680
Tommy's at school, yeah?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.893
He'll be looked after until we get back.
He'll be all right.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.893
Thank God. Yo!
Help us!

21:11.971 --> 21:16.738
Help us. Help.
Help us. Over here.

21:18.577 --> 21:19.566
Oh, God.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.704
Hey. Hey.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.615
Wait. Come on, over here!

21:25.718 --> 21:28.414
There, there. Over there.
I can see someone.

21:28.487 --> 21:31.479
Yo, we need some help down here.

21:31.590 --> 21:35.458
Help us, please!

21:35.561 --> 21:38.291
Hello. We need some help down here.

21:38.397 --> 21:41.059
Yeah, he's seen us.
He's seen us.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.827
Oh, thank God.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.806
Jump, jump, jump.

21:56.248 --> 21:59.775
Okay. Jess,
come on, come on.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.252
Jess. Come on.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.448
Come on, come on,
take my hand. Okay.

22:04.523 --> 22:07.651
Okay. You okay?

22:24.543 --> 22:27.205
You okay? Yeah?

22:31.016 --> 22:32.210
Hey.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.513
How is it?

22:34.620 --> 22:38.181
See? I told you.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.522
Hello?

22:55.541 --> 22:57.509
Hello?

22:58.410 --> 23:00.401
Hello!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.915
Do we wait?

23:07.019 --> 23:08.577
No, let's go to the bridge.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.485
We'll get the captain to put
a call out to the coast guard.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.218
We'll get a search for Heather.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.425
Oome on.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.898
Do you think Heather would've
made it on board?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.027
Honey.

23:25.104 --> 23:26.765
There's a chance, isn't there?

23:26.872 --> 23:29.773
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

23:55.901 --> 23:58.096
Hello?

24:00.406 --> 24:02.237
Hello?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.285
Hello!

24:21.627 --> 24:23.925
Somebody please help us?

24:26.732 --> 24:28.461
Hello?

24:41.413 --> 24:43.745
Where the fuck is everybody?

24:43.816 --> 24:47.308
You don't even now
where we're going.

24:47.419 --> 24:50.855
Well, we're just, just walking
for the sake of it.

25:03.869 --> 25:06.303
You all right?

25:06.372 --> 25:09.500
I feel like
I know this place.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.971
I recognize this corridor.

25:14.046 --> 25:18.779
Liners, they look pretty similar.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.285
No, that's not it.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.844
Come check this out.

25:23.956 --> 25:26.720
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

25:26.825 --> 25:28.292
Jess.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.856
Oome on.
Oome on.

25:31.964 --> 25:35.661
1932. It's the same.
Here's where we boarded.

25:35.734 --> 25:38.794
Oh, yeah.

25:38.871 --> 25:43.706
Aeolus.

25:43.809 --> 25:47.301
Aeolus was the Greek god of the winds
and the father of Sisyphus,

25:47.413 --> 25:50.644
the man condemned by the gods to the task
of pushing a rock up a mountain

25:50.716 --> 25:52.650
and let it see
roll back down again.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.686
That's a shitty punishment.
What did he do?

25:54.820 --> 25:58.586
He cheated Death. No, he made
a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

25:58.690 --> 26:02.990
I studied it but I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving, please?

26:07.699 --> 26:09.496
Hello?

26:32.191 --> 26:34.523
Whoever it was might wanna come
back for these.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.424
Let me see?

26:39.865 --> 26:42.026
These are mine.

26:42.101 --> 26:43.398
These are my keys.

26:43.469 --> 26:44.902
What are you talking about?

26:44.970 --> 26:45.959
They're mine.

26:46.071 --> 26:47.402
Bullshit.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.566
This is, this is my house key.

26:49.641 --> 26:53.702
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

26:53.779 --> 26:55.974
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

26:56.081 --> 26:58.140
Yes.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.410
It's gotta be Heather.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.543
Come on.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.416
How else did they get here?

27:02.554 --> 27:06.320
It was Heather dropping her keys but
not bothering to say, "I didn't drown."

27:06.425 --> 27:07.619
Why not?

27:09.628 --> 27:12.290
Come on.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.001
Heather?

27:30.983 --> 27:34.851
Looks like you get your welcome party,
just not the welcome.

27:42.961 --> 27:44.485
Heather!

27:44.596 --> 27:46.587
Yo, Greg, what time you got?

27:46.665 --> 27:48.997
Eleven thirty.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.001
Heather.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.702
Heather!

27:59.978 --> 28:01.104
Where is everyone?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.704
Heather!

28:02.814 --> 28:04.941
Sally! Please. Please.

28:05.017 --> 28:08.612
I don't know where everyone is
but the ship's not deserted.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.316
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

28:12.391 --> 28:13.949
so let's just go
to the bridge.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.358
We'll find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.391
I saw someone.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.125
Fuck.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.861
Wait.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.073
Hello?

28:52.264 --> 28:55.028
Did you see who it was?
Was it Heather?

28:55.100 --> 28:57.694
I didn't see.

28:57.769 --> 29:00.499
I'm sorry.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.039
Where're you going?

29:02.107 --> 29:04.098
Why don't you
just help me out here?

29:04.209 --> 29:05.904
What?

29:06.011 --> 29:07.740
Just wait for Vic.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.172
What?

29:12.251 --> 29:13.240
It's fine.

29:13.352 --> 29:14.876
Why can't we go with him?

29:14.953 --> 29:18.411
Let's just do as Greg says and
wait here for Victor, okay?

29:18.523 --> 29:19.581
Fine.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.249
I think Victor's in danger.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.555
I'm not worried about Victor.

29:23.629 --> 29:26.621
I'm sorry I'm acting weird.
It's just I'm having deja vu

29:26.732 --> 29:28.359
every time I turn a corner.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.695
No, no. No.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.235
I know this place.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.737
No, you don't know this place.
You're just in shock.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.272
That's funny.

29:35.374 --> 29:37.399
What is it? What is it?
Is it Tommy?

29:37.476 --> 29:41.276
Is it guilt? Is that what it is?
Do you feel guilty?

30:04.069 --> 30:06.128
Hello?

30:47.679 --> 30:50.011
Hello.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.553
Hello.

31:31.656 --> 31:35.649
We're on the third floor. The bridge
is exactly two floors above us.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.060
Greg, that was blood.
Are you just gonna ignore it?

31:39.164 --> 31:41.098
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

31:41.233 --> 31:44.498
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off some steam.

31:44.569 --> 31:48.562
What? They rescue us from
the sea and then they just hide for fun?

31:48.673 --> 31:51.073
Yeah.

31:51.176 --> 31:53.110
Well, what's your theory?

31:53.211 --> 31:55.679
I don't know, but I'm not,
but I'm not in shock.

31:55.747 --> 31:58.773
I'll be in the ball room.
I'm getting off this ship.

31:58.884 --> 32:02.342
Jess, fuck! Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

32:02.421 --> 32:05.857
Jess! Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.

32:05.924 --> 32:10.520
They have skippers. I mean,
in your world right now they don't.

32:13.932 --> 32:19.063
My world is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

32:19.137 --> 32:22.300
Don't talk to me about my world.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.909
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.462
Is that blood?

32:51.269 --> 32:54.238
Babe, come on, we're supposed
to meet them in the theater.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.672
Heather!

32:58.743 --> 33:01.007
Oh, my God. Shit.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.410
Sally. Sal, come on.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.848
Let's just go to the theater.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.361
Downey, I can't see anymore blood.
I don't think she's in here.

33:25.470 --> 33:28.337
To be honest with you, I don't think
she's even on the ship.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.374
Okay. So whose blood was that?

33:37.349 --> 33:39.214
Hello?

33:41.319 --> 33:44.652
Downey? Sally?

34:18.255 --> 34:20.246
Victor. What happened?

34:52.456 --> 34:54.288
Oh, my God.

35:10.642 --> 35:15.545
Stay with me, Greg.
Stay with me, man.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.979
Stay with me, man.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.912
No. No!

35:21.987 --> 35:24.319
You fucking bitch!
You shot him!

35:24.422 --> 35:25.411
What?

35:25.490 --> 35:27.048
He said you shot him.

35:27.125 --> 35:28.717
I didn't!

35:28.793 --> 35:29.919
Fucking liar!

35:29.995 --> 35:31.394
I wasn't even with Greg!

35:31.463 --> 35:35.559
He's dead! He's dead!
Look!

35:35.634 --> 35:37.431
God, you're a bitch!

35:43.808 --> 35:45.742
Get your hands off him!

35:45.810 --> 35:48.506
I didn't do it!
I was with Victor.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.080
Someone attacked him.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.912
Someone?

35:54.185 --> 35:55.482
You think I did it?

35:55.587 --> 35:58.078
Why did you tell us
to come to the theater?

35:58.156 --> 36:02.320
I didn't. L...
Sally, I didn't.

36:02.427 --> 36:03.917
I didn't.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.463
My God, you're a fucking skitso.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.926
Sally, no.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.941
Sally!

36:22.013 --> 36:23.708
No!

36:25.383 --> 36:28.944
Downey!

36:30.789 --> 36:32.381
Let it go. Let it go.

36:32.490 --> 36:34.321
No!

38:49.460 --> 38:51.655
Don't shoot. Please.

38:55.099 --> 38:57.090
Please, don't shoot. Please.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.659
I have a son.
I have a son.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.357
Shit.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.745
Who are you? Tell me!

40:21.185 --> 40:22.243
Who are you?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.113
What the fuck are you saying?

40:26.224 --> 40:28.385
It's the only way to get home.

40:28.459 --> 40:29.949
What?

40:30.061 --> 40:32.052
You have to kill them.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.233
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them!

42:42.060 --> 42:45.860
Over here.
Come on. Hey!

42:48.232 --> 42:50.860
Help us, please!

42:50.935 --> 42:53.233
Help!

42:55.173 --> 42:56.697
Hey. Hey.

42:56.774 --> 42:58.503
Help us!

42:58.576 --> 42:59.838
Please!

42:59.911 --> 43:03.779
There, there. Over there.
I can see somebody.

43:03.881 --> 43:05.940
Please!

43:39.951 --> 43:41.919
Hello?

43:41.986 --> 43:43.715
Looks like they decided
to scratch the welcome.

43:43.788 --> 43:45.585
Let's go to the bridge.

43:45.656 --> 43:49.148
We'll get the captain to put a call
out to the coast guard.

43:53.998 --> 43:55.898
Hello!

44:05.476 --> 44:06.966
Hello?

44:14.986 --> 44:18.114
Where the fuck is everybody?

44:23.127 --> 44:25.322
Do you even know
where we're going?

44:32.303 --> 44:35.932
Well, we're just, just walking
for the sake of it.

44:40.111 --> 44:41.601
You all right?

44:41.679 --> 44:44.273
I feel like I know this place.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.976
I recognize this corridor.

44:47.051 --> 44:50.509
Liners, they look pretty similar.

44:50.621 --> 44:53.146
No, that's not it.

44:54.992 --> 44:56.721
Jess, come on.

44:56.827 --> 44:59.387
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

44:59.497 --> 45:02.796
Yeah. 1932.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.028
It is the same.
Here's where we boarded.

45:05.136 --> 45:08.697
Yeah. Aeolus.

45:08.806 --> 45:10.967
Aeolus.

45:11.042 --> 45:14.170
Aeotus was the Greek god of the winds
and the father of Sisyphus,

45:14.312 --> 45:17.543
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain

45:17.648 --> 45:19.479
only to have it
roll back down again.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.711
That's a shitty punishment.
What did he do?

45:21.852 --> 45:25.413
He cheated Death. No, he made
a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

45:25.523 --> 45:28.686
I studied him and I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving?

45:33.864 --> 45:35.491
Hello?

46:43.401 --> 46:45.596
Heather?

46:46.671 --> 46:48.468
Hello!

46:51.409 --> 46:53.400
Heather!

46:55.613 --> 46:57.274
Heather!

46:57.348 --> 47:01.079
Sally. Please. I don't
know where everyone is.

47:01.152 --> 47:02.744
But the ship's not deserted.

47:02.820 --> 47:06.256
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

47:06.324 --> 47:07.791
so let's just go to the bridge.

47:07.858 --> 47:10.850
We'll find the skipper
and then we go home.

47:10.961 --> 47:13.327
I saw someone.

47:57.074 --> 47:59.065
Hello?

48:05.983 --> 48:07.712
Hello.

48:18.162 --> 48:20.653
Shit. How did you
get here so fast?

48:20.731 --> 48:24.258
Victor, you got, you gotta listen to me.
We don't have much time.

48:24.368 --> 48:25.995
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.094
He's dead.

48:27.204 --> 48:28.501
What?

48:28.572 --> 48:30.403
No, I mean, he was dead.
He's not dead now.

48:30.508 --> 48:31.907
What are you saying?

48:32.009 --> 48:35.604
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

48:35.713 --> 48:38.705
Me, walking and
talking with Greg.

48:39.717 --> 48:41.708
Right.

48:48.392 --> 48:50.189
There.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.728
There's birds.

48:51.796 --> 48:53.593
No, that was Downey's body.

48:53.697 --> 48:56.632
I just left Downey back there.
How did you get here so fast?

48:56.734 --> 48:59.100
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

49:09.079 --> 49:13.277
No. Downey was there.
It was Downey's body.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.251
There are bodies
all over this ship.

49:18.322 --> 49:22.224
Your body is on the floor at the restaurant
with a hole in your head.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.659
Listen, I'm gonna do
you a favor, okay?

49:24.762 --> 49:26.889
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

49:26.964 --> 49:31.333
It's the truth. Victor, we gotta get
off this ship right now.

49:31.435 --> 49:33.403
You're saying there's
two of you now.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.063
Yes.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.663
And I'm dead in the restaurant.

49:36.774 --> 49:38.298
You were killed.

49:38.409 --> 49:42.140
Okay. So, I'm dead. Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

49:42.246 --> 49:44.305
Is Sally okay?

49:44.415 --> 49:46.849
See where I'm going
with this, right?

49:46.951 --> 49:48.782
If we are dead and
there's two of you,

49:48.853 --> 49:50.844
how are we all gonna
get off this ship?

49:50.955 --> 49:53.253
We should never have
boarded this ship.

49:53.324 --> 49:55.019
I knew something was wrong.

49:55.125 --> 49:58.458
I should've forced you to stay
on the yacht and you'd all be alive.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.656
I've gotta tell you I feel pretty
alive right now.

50:00.798 --> 50:04.928
Soon you're gonna be dead. Everything
that happened to you, happened before.

50:05.002 --> 50:07.766
I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

50:07.838 --> 50:11.296
You will die and then, then Downey
and Sally and then Greg.

50:26.457 --> 50:29.119
I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.

50:44.074 --> 50:47.043
We're on the third level.

50:47.144 --> 50:50.375
Greg, that was blood.
You just gonna ignore it?

50:50.481 --> 50:52.415
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.383
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off some steam.

51:05.930 --> 51:08.660
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

51:08.732 --> 51:11.257
Ships don'just magically appear
out of nowhere.

51:11.368 --> 51:14.860
They have skippers. I mean,
in your world right now they don't.

51:14.939 --> 51:19.376
My wortd is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

51:20.911 --> 51:22.936
Don't talk to me
about my world.

51:35.960 --> 51:37.894
Who are you?

51:41.198 --> 51:43.223
Who are you?

52:38.822 --> 52:41.655
Who are you?

52:41.759 --> 52:43.750
Listen, listen to me.

52:43.827 --> 52:46.022
Please, you have to listen.

52:47.598 --> 52:49.259
Kill them all.

52:49.333 --> 52:52.461
If they board, kill them.

52:54.338 --> 52:56.932
Jess. Jess, you gotta kill them.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.202
Please, you have to listen.

52:59.309 --> 53:01.607
Don't let them board.

53:01.679 --> 53:04.944
No, no. No. Please, please.
Stop, stop them.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.279
If they board, kill them.

53:07.351 --> 53:09.717
Jess. Jess, you gotta kill them.

53:09.820 --> 53:11.651
If they board, kill them.

53:11.722 --> 53:15.658
No, no. No. Please, please, stop.
If they board, kill them.

53:15.726 --> 53:18.991
Please, please stop.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

53:19.063 --> 53:21.657
Fuck you!

54:24.094 --> 54:26.289
Shit.

54:33.737 --> 54:35.762
Tommy.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.913
Is that blood?

54:52.556 --> 54:55.116
Babe, come on. We're supposed
to meet them at the theater.

55:22.085 --> 55:23.643
Victor.

55:27.658 --> 55:29.626
I didn't mean to hurt you.

55:29.693 --> 55:32.958
You know I didn't mean
to hurt you, right?

55:33.030 --> 55:36.295
Now, I'm gonna try and get us off
this ship, okay?

55:36.366 --> 55:38.095
Sally.

55:39.636 --> 55:41.604
Sally?

55:45.542 --> 55:47.533
Sally?

56:03.894 --> 56:05.555
Victor?

56:05.662 --> 56:07.357
What happened?

56:23.981 --> 56:25.209
You're not me.

56:41.198 --> 56:43.325
You're not me.

57:14.564 --> 57:17.260
You see? I'm not crazy.

57:22.973 --> 57:24.634
Victor.

57:24.741 --> 57:28.541
This didn't happen
before. Don't you see?

57:28.612 --> 57:31.206
You tried to
strangle me, remember?

57:31.281 --> 57:33.772
Now, you gotta be strong.
I'm gonna get the others.

57:39.156 --> 57:41.716
Downey, do something.

57:41.792 --> 57:43.384
Stay with me, man.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.223
Do something.

57:45.295 --> 57:46.728
I don't know what to do.

57:46.797 --> 57:49.459
Is he dead?
Is he dead?

57:49.566 --> 57:52.296
Greg. Greg.

57:54.137 --> 57:55.661
You fucking...

57:55.772 --> 57:58.332
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
We don't have much time.

57:58.442 --> 57:59.909
Don't you point that thing.

57:59.977 --> 58:01.638
Move!

58:02.479 --> 58:03.969
Go, go, go.

58:05.582 --> 58:07.743
I hit her.
I think I hit her.

58:07.818 --> 58:09.308
What's going on?
Who was that?

58:09.419 --> 58:12.820
It's starting over again.
That's what's going on.

58:12.923 --> 58:14.083
Let's go.

58:14.157 --> 58:15.681
We can't leave without Greg.

58:15.792 --> 58:18.420
We'll come back for Greg.
I promise. Let's go, come on!

58:21.164 --> 58:23.598
We can change the pattern.
Don't you see?

58:23.667 --> 58:27.433
We change the pattern, we're not trapped.
Then we get off this thing.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.369
She's fucking mad.

58:29.473 --> 58:30.440
You think?

58:30.507 --> 58:31.633
You have to listen to me.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.141
No, I don't have
to listen to you.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.643
Was it me that shot you?

58:34.711 --> 58:36.201
I don't know.

58:36.313 --> 58:38.781
Whoa, wait. Could we just take
a breath for a second?

58:38.849 --> 58:41.010
Okay, Jess, I am prepared
to listen to you

58:41.118 --> 58:43.450
and even to believe you,
but you gotta make some sense.

58:43.520 --> 58:47.217
I'm making perfect sense. I'm gonna get Victor,
then we get off this ship.

58:47.324 --> 58:49.986
Wait here.

58:52.029 --> 58:53.826
And don't trust anyone.

58:53.897 --> 58:56.388
If anyone comes, you shoot them.

58:56.500 --> 58:57.967
What are you talking about?

58:58.035 --> 58:59.366
You shoot them.

59:00.470 --> 59:02.335
What?

59:11.048 --> 59:12.913
Victor.

59:13.917 --> 59:15.509
Victor?

59:44.915 --> 59:46.780
I said who is it?

59:54.458 --> 59:56.255
I said who is it?

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.398
It's me, Jess.

01:00:13.143 --> 01:00:15.373
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened to you?

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:17.413
A long story.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.380
Where's Victor?

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:24.079
He's dead.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:28.289
He fell over the side.

01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:31.921
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.622
You don't.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:36.130
If you wanna live,
you'll follow me.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:43.297
Downey!

01:00:43.406 --> 01:00:45.237
Ignore it.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.401
Downey!

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.910
What's going on?

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:51.106
Is said ignore it.

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:52.944
Where are you?
Call out.

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:57.476
No, t'm not just gonna ignore it.
What is going on?

01:00:57.587 --> 01:00:59.350
Where the fuck are you?

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:03.017
Call out! You're in danger.
You're in danger.

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.526
Who is that?

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:07.620
Not who you think?

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:17.667
So, what are we doing in here?

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:40.656
Sally!

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.459
Wait!

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:55.005
I'm sorry but I love my son.

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:01.011
Sally?

01:02:01.084 --> 01:02:03.143
That wasn't me.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.054
Sally?

01:02:38.088 --> 01:02:39.783
Sally?

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:07.481
Hello? Hello?

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:09.916
Please, can you hear me?

01:03:09.986 --> 01:03:12.420
Help me.
Please, help me.

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:14.150
She's killing everyone.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:17.556
They're dead. They're all dead.
Please...

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.390
Sally?

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:22.397
What's your position? Over.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:29.169
Sally.

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:32.571
Distressed caller, we hear you.
What are your coordinates? Over.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:39.081
Coast guard, did you hear a distress call?
We're not getting in anymore. Over.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:41.913
Greg.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:44.510
Greg, is that you?

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:52.793
Distressed caller, make another
transmission. What is your position?

01:03:52.862 --> 01:03:55.126
Greg, can you hear me? Greg.

01:03:57.967 --> 01:03:59.628
Shit.

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:10.641
Sally?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.678
Sally?

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:15.271
Oh, my God, what happened to you?

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:18.404
Get away from me.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:21.951
It wasn't me, Sally.
I didn't do this to you.

01:05:25.355 --> 01:05:27.880
It wasn't me.
Where is Downey?

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:30.619
I don't know where he is.

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:32.058
You killed him.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.562
What?

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:38.032
No, I didn't.
I didn't kill him.

01:05:38.101 --> 01:05:39.227
What?

01:05:39.302 --> 01:05:40.564
I swear.

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:42.696
You're crazy.

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.797
Why are you doing this?

01:05:44.908 --> 01:05:47.706
Sally, I know it's hard
but you gotta trust me.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.143
Gotta trust me, okay?

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.499
Listen, you gotta hold on.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:21.099
I think it will return again.

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:25.238
The yacht, the Triangle,
I think it'll come back.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.250
If it does, we'll escape,
me and you together.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.116
We'll re-board it and escape.

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:34.486
Please.

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:39.859
Don't hurt me.

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:42.329
Sally, I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.161
If you hold on,

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:48.863
you can see Downey again.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:19.896
Hey, come on. Over here.

01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:23.200
Hey. Hey. Help.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:25.900
It returns when they're dead.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.016
It returns when everyone's dead.

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:50.529
Do you think Heather
woutd've made it on board?

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.828
Honey.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.493
There's a chance, isn't there?

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.538
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.390
Stop this thing.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.551
Stop this fucking thing.

01:09:11.913 --> 01:09:13.973
Please.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:16.448
I wanna go home.

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.752
I wanna go home.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:50.444
He's dead.
I mean, he was dead.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.647
He's not dead now.

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:55.020
I was hiding and I saw
this version of myself,

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:58.890
and she had blood on her face,
and then I killed her.

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.792
I killed her on
the front of the ship.

01:10:00.863 --> 01:10:02.797
Listen, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:05.060
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

01:10:05.168 --> 01:10:07.068
It's the truth.
You gotta listen to me.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:09.468
No, I'm not listening
to another word you say.

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:13.373
You will die, and then
Greg and then Downey.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:47.035
Don't be scared, Victor.
I can save you.

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:51.436
I know how to save you.

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:08.253
You should try and eat, babe.

01:12:11.194 --> 01:12:13.162
Jess?

01:12:25.007 --> 01:12:27.134
Jesus, what happened to you?

01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:28.768
Where's Greg?

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:31.439
Greg told me to tell you
we should meet in the theater.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.210
There's a theater?

01:12:34.317 --> 01:12:36.945
Yes, it'just that way.

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.509
Where are you going?

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:40.282
I'll see you there.

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.655
Okay, she's really
starting to freak me out now.

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.495
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

01:13:23.566 --> 01:13:27.525
Ships don't just magically appear out of nowhere.
They have skippers.

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:29.662
In your world right
now maybe they don't.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:34.836
My wortd is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.778
Don't talk to me about my world.

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.947
Jess.

01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:42.881
Jess, I'm sorry.

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.919
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:14:21.991 --> 01:14:23.959
Okay.

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.722
Take it easy, man.

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.787
Just take it easy.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.633
What did we do?
We're not part of this boat.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:38.297
We just got here, okay? We've been walking
around. There's no one on it.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:41.604
I can go right now. I will go.

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:45.113
Okay? Just...
Just take it easy.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.081
Take it easy.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:48.912
Okay?

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.754
Jess?

01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.924
Jess.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.361
Jess, what are you doing?

01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:05.924
Wha... what is this?
Why... what are you wearing?

01:15:06.002 --> 01:15:07.993
I don't want you to see my face.

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:09.628
Why?

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:12.037
Because this is not me.

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:15.838
I'm somewhere out there
in the yacht and you're with me.

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:20.808
And after I kill you, we'll return.

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:23.044
Is that right?

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:28.054
You know, why-why don't you just put
down the gun first?

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:30.853
Okay? Come on.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.451
You see, the boat comes back when
you're all dead.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.690
I've done everything
exactly like before.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:38.631
But when the boat comes back, I'll be
ready, I'll be waiting.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:43.070
I'll be on the landing bay. I won't
let any of them board, even the other me.

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:45.504
I'll make them all stay
on the upturned yacht.

01:15:45.574 --> 01:15:46.836
Okay.

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:50.902
Jess, we'll do
whatever you want.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:54.380
Okay? Just, just put down the gun.

01:15:57.253 --> 01:15:58.311
Come on.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:15:59.877
I'm so sorry.

01:15:59.989 --> 01:16:01.547
No, no, no, no!

01:16:03.692 --> 01:16:05.353
Greg!

01:16:05.428 --> 01:16:07.259
Oh, God!
What happened?

01:16:07.363 --> 01:16:09.058
It was Jess.

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:12.862
You fucking bitch!
You shot him. He said you shot him.

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.402
I wasn't even with Greg!

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:16.664
He's dead!
He's dead!

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:20.934
My God, you're a fucking skitso.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.505
Downey!

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:41.956
Please.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.758
Don't kill me.

01:17:44.827 --> 01:17:49.321
I have a son.

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:10.841
Who are you?

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.838
Tell me!

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.507
They'll return.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:16.346
Who are you?

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.909
They'll return.
You have to kill them.

01:19:19.021 --> 01:19:20.511
It's the only way to get home.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.056
What the fuck are you saying?

01:19:22.124 --> 01:19:24.684
It's the only way
to save our son.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.193
You have to kill them.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:28.628
Kill them?
Kill them?

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:57.230
Hurry up, Sweetheart.
We're gonna be tate.

01:23:32.541 --> 01:23:34.133
What's fun in buying you things

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.700
if you're gonna leave
them in the fucking garden!

01:23:36.812 --> 01:23:38.871
I'm sick of telling
you this, Tommy.

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:43.110
I ain't buying you anymore toys if you can't
look after the ones you've got.

01:23:48.624 --> 01:23:51.024
Now what?

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:56.159
Oh, I'll just
clean it up, shall I?

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:02.129
Yeah, I'm just cleaning
the fucking mess!

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:08.734
What's the matter with you, huh?
What's the matter with you?

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:12.871
Just one day off is all I ask.
Just one fucking day off!

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:18.649
I don't know why you can't paint
a picture like a normal kid.

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:21.188
You get this from your father.

01:24:21.256 --> 01:24:23.520
He was an asshole, too.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.567
Shit.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:53.116
Jack?

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:55.746
Did you see anyone
ring my doorbell?

01:25:32.828 --> 01:25:34.420
Tommy?

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:37.660
Sweetheart, come here.

01:25:37.766 --> 01:25:41.395
Come here.
Come here! It's okay.

01:25:48.477 --> 01:25:50.809
Mommy's fine, you see?

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:54.176
Mommy's fine.

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:59.781
You're just having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

01:25:59.855 --> 01:26:02.688
It's all it was.

01:26:02.791 --> 01:26:06.090
Bad dreams make you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.706
Things are gonna be
different now, Tommy.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.979
Mommy won't lose
her temper anymore,

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:01.208
even when you do things wrong.

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:04.485
And she won't hurt you.

01:27:05.687 --> 01:27:07.814
I know she won't hurt you.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:11.222
You know how I know that, Tommy?

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:15.160
Because that woman that did those
things to you is not Mommy.

01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:18.324
This is Mommy. Mommy's nice.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.890
Shit.

01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:26.100
Shit.

01:27:39.554 --> 01:27:41.715
Tommy, stay in the car.

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:43.917
I'm gonna bury it, okay?

01:28:45.453 --> 01:28:48.149
We have to go.
We have to get out of here.

01:28:52.594 --> 01:28:54.926
Stop screaming, babe.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.794
Please, Tommy, it is just blood.

01:28:57.866 --> 01:28:59.697
Stop screaming!

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:02.497
Tommy, look. See?
There, it's gone.

01:29:02.604 --> 01:29:04.868
See? There. It's gone.

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:36.791
Are you all right?

01:30:42.304 --> 01:30:44.204
Who are you?

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.967
Just a driver.

01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:56.317
No point trying to save the boy.

01:30:56.418 --> 01:30:59.387
There's nothing anyone can do that's gonna
bring him back.

01:31:02.991 --> 01:31:04.925
Can I give you a ride?

01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.724
Yes.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.496
Take me to the harbor.

01:31:36.825 --> 01:31:38.622
Hey.

01:31:43.798 --> 01:31:46.164
I'll leave the meter running.

01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:54.631
You will come back, won't you?

01:31:57.012 --> 01:32:00.106
Yes, I-I promise.

01:32:20.802 --> 01:32:22.030
Jess.

01:32:26.508 --> 01:32:28.203
Do you know me?

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:31.870
I feel like I do.
Greg talks about you enough.

01:32:33.882 --> 01:32:35.645
Where is Greg?

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:37.708
Where do you think?

01:32:37.819 --> 01:32:39.753
Come on, you're late.

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.913
You're the one with the kid, right?

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:44.651
Yeah.

01:32:44.726 --> 01:32:46.853
How come you didn't
bring him along?

01:32:53.868 --> 01:32:56.894
He's at school.

01:32:57.005 --> 01:32:59.565
You sure about that?

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.505
Yes.

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:12.848
Are you okay?

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:15.549
I don't think so.

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:18.091
Hey, what's the matter?
What happened?

01:33:21.396 --> 01:33:22.863
Hey.

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:24.592
I'm sorry.

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:28.863
You have nothing to apologize for.
What's the matter?

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:30.871
I'm just tired.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.601
Listen, we don't have to go today if
you don't want to.

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:36.370
No, I do.
I-I wanna go.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.742
Are you sure?

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:46.319
Yeah.

01:33:46.421 --> 01:33:48.480
Yeah? Come, come here.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:58.065
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

01:33:58.133 --> 01:34:00.897
This is Heather, Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.766
Let's go sailing.

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:04.805
Okay.
