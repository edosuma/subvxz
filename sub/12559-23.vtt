YES, I KNOW.

12:14.692 --> 12:15.853
THIRTY-EIGHT.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.981
WELL, ISN'T THAT TRUE?

12:18.071 --> 12:20.108
MR. HERRICK, YOU
WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME

12:20.198 --> 12:24.487
IF I TOLD YOU HOW
OLD I TH/NKSHE IS.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.114
YOU THINK?
DON'T YOU KNOW?

12:27.205 --> 12:30.698
NO... NOT REALLY.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.035
BUT YOU'RE HER MOTHER.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.505
NO.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.126
I'M NOT HER MOTHER.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.423
I AM HER DAUGHTER!

13:14.794 --> 13:19.254
I DON'T KNOVV VVHEN I'\/E
HAD SUCH A VVONDERFUL TIME.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.627
YOU'VE BEEN SO QUIET
ALL EVENING.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.208
WHAT IS IT?

13:23.303 --> 13:26.637
OH, IT'S... SOMETHING
YOUR MOTHER SAID.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.385
NOW, I DON'T BELIEVE
IT, BUT IT JUST...

13:29.475 --> 13:30.886
IT JUST STICKS
IN MY MIND.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.969
WELL, TELL ME.

13:34.063 --> 13:38.523
SHE SAID THAT YOU
ARE HER MOTHER.

13:38.609 --> 13:40.020
HER MOTHER?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.647
HER MOTHER.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.981
JORDAN, DARLING,
YOU MUST BELIEVE ME.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.985
MY MOTHER IS DISTURBED.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.242
I'M SURE IT'S BECAUSE
SHE FEELS RESPONSIBLE

13:49.329 --> 13:51.161
FOR MY FATHER'S DEATH.

13:51.247 --> 13:54.205
THEY VVERE RETURNING HOME
FROM A PARTY TEN YEARS AGO.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.784
SHE WAS DRIVING THE CAR,
AND IT WENT OFF THE ROAD,

13:56.878 --> 13:58.209
AND MY FATHER WAS KILLED.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.412
I'M SORRY.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.589
EVER SINCE THEN, SHE'S
BEEN FURTIVE, SUSPICIOUS,

14:03.676 --> 14:05.587
IMAGINING ALL KINDS
OF TERRIBLE THINGS.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.012
I'VE TRIED TO HELP HER--
REALLY, I HAVE--

14:09.098 --> 14:11.135
BUT THE DOCTORS SAY
IT'S HOPELESS.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.182
SHE SHOULD BE PUT AVVAY,
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD-

14:13.227 --> 14:14.729
I NEVER SHOULD'VE
BROUGHT IT UP.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.304
NOW, LET'S
FORGET ABOUT IT.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.934
ALL RIGHT.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.983
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.529
AFTER ALL, WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT ME, AND...

14:25.615 --> 14:28.778
NOW YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.109
WHAT ABOUT YOUR LIFE?

14:31.204 --> 14:35.368
[deep sigh] VERY DULL...
UP UNTIL NOW.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.665
ALL RIGHT, THEN TELL ME
WHERE YOU'RE FROM.

14:37.752 --> 14:41.711
CHICAGO. I STILL
LIVE THERE.

14:41.756 --> 14:45.249
I'VE PLAYED CHICAGO.
THE WELLS THEATER.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.378
HAVE YOU REALLY?

14:46.469 --> 14:47.675
[sigh]

14:56.145 --> 14:58.432
I'VE LOVED
EVERY MOMENT OF IT.

14:58.523 --> 15:02.187
I REALLY HAVE.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.653
SHALL I SEE
YOU TOMORROW?

15:03.736 --> 15:06.068
TOMORROW.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.657

15:12.870 --> 15:15.988
HI, JORDY, GLAD YOU CALLED.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.540

IWANT YOU
TO DO SOMETHING.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.168
GET OUT THE FILE ON A PICTURE
CALLED QUEEN OF THE N/LE-

15:29.262 --> 15:30.548
<i>WHICH ONE?</i>

15:30.638 --> 15:31.969
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHICH ONE?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.797
YOU'RE A LITTLE
YOUNG FOR THIS.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.302
THEY MADE TWO OF THEM.

15:35.393 --> 15:36.975
THE FIRST ONE, A SILENT,
I THINK.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.678
<i>AROUND 1920,
MAYBE A LITTLE LATER.</i>

15:39.772 --> 15:41.683
ALL RIGHT, GET THEM BOTH.
I'LL HANG ON.

15:41.774 --> 15:42.855

15:57.248 --> 15:59.364
HEY, YOU THERE?

15:59.459 --> 16:02.326
YEAH. VVHAT VVAS THE NAME OF THE
GIRL VVHO STARRED IN THE ORIGINAL?

16:02.420 --> 16:03.831
CONSTANCE TAYLOR.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.787
ANYWAY, SHE STARRED
IN MOST OF IT.

16:05.882 --> 16:09.500
THERE VVAS AN ACCIDENT DURING
THE LAST DAY OF SHOOTING.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.632
CAVE-IN IN A TOMB IN EGYPT.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.928
<i>THEY NEVER FOUND HER.</i>

16:14.015 --> 16:15.676
NEVER FOUND HER?

16:15.766 --> 16:17.894
NO, IT WAS THE END OF
A VERY PROMISING CAREER.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.719
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I MET CONSTANCE TAYLOR

16:20.813 --> 16:22.349
WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.101
<i>SHE WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN.</i>

16:24.192 --> 16:25.978
HOW DO YOU
MEAN, "EXTRAORDINARY"?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.354
WELL, SHE WAS AGELESS.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.901
SHE'D BEEN
A REIGNING BEAUTY

16:28.988 --> 16:30.729
IN THE DAYS
OF THE FLORA DORA GIRLS.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.485
<i>THAT WAS A LITTLE
BEFORE YOUR TIME.</i>

16:33.576 --> 16:35.817
SHE WAS A <i>REAL</i> FEMME FATALE.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.153
SHE'D BEEN MARRIED
HALF A DOZEN TIMES

16:38.206 --> 16:39.867
BEFORE THE ACCIDENT
IN EGYPT.

16:39.957 --> 16:42.494
SOUNDS LIKE PAMELA MORRIS,
THE SAME HISTORY.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.750
VERY MUCH THE SAME,
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.828
YOU GOT A PICTURE
OF THIS TAYLOR GIRL?

16:46.881 --> 16:48.497
<i>YEAH.</i>

16:48.591 --> 16:50.047
COMPARE IT TO A
PICTURE OF MORRIS.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.096
YEAH, JORDY?

17:05.191 --> 17:06.477
WELL?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.183
THEY LOOK ALIKE,

17:08.277 --> 17:09.858
BUT THEN, THEY PLAYED
THE SAME PARTS.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.904
<i>SAME MAKEUP,
SAME TYPE COSTUME.</i>

17:12.990 --> 17:15.196
KRUEGER, THE
OLD WELLS THEATER--

17:15.242 --> 17:16.904
WHAT YEAR DID
THEY TEAR THAT DOWN?

17:16.993 --> 17:21.157
OH, SOMETIME BACK
IN THE '2OS. WHY, JORDY?

17:21.249 --> 17:23.286
OH, NEVER MIND.
NOT UNTIL I'M REAL SURE.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.333
IN THE MEANTIME,
GET ME A LIST

17:25.419 --> 17:27.160

PRESS RELEASE,

17:28.714 --> 17:29.749

17:29.840 --> 17:30.921
SOUNDS INTERESTING.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.045
MAY SOUND FANTASTIC.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.686
WELL?

17:48.776 --> 17:52.144
IT'S ALL TRUE,
MR. HERRICK.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.229
IT'S <i>ALL</i> TRUE.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.899
BUT DON'T SHOW
IT TO HER.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.443
LEAVE HERE AT ONCE.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.027
IS THIS PAMELA?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.079

18:03.124 --> 18:04.580
<i>PLEASE, MR. HERRICK,</i>

18:04.667 --> 18:08.331
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW IT IS.

18:08.421 --> 18:11.083
SHE HAD MANY
DIFFERENT NAMES.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.756
BUT SHE HERSELF HASN'T
CHANGED IN 4O YEARS.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.426
4O YEARS?

18:16.512 --> 18:19.129
AT LEAST 70 YEARS--

18:19.223 --> 18:23.091
THE TOTAL SUM OF MY LIFE.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.011
<i>CAN YOU IMAGINE

18:26.105 --> 18:30.099
TO SEE HER ALWAYS
SO FRESH AND BEAUTIFUL

18:30.151 --> 18:32.438
WHILE MY MIRRORED IMAGE

18:32.528 --> 18:36.271

YELLOVVED VVITH AGE?

18:36.324 --> 18:38.861
HOW OLD IS SHE, REALLY?

18:38.951 --> 18:40.988
SHE'S AGELESS.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.819
PERHAPS SHE'S ETERNAL.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.745
WHAT IS THE SECRET?

18:44.832 --> 18:48.951
WHAT WOMAN WOULD NOT
SELL HER SOUL--TO KNOW?

18:52.006 --> 18:54.338
IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO--

18:54.425 --> 18:56.666
WITH THIS BEETLE...

18:56.761 --> 18:58.297
<i>WITH EGYPT.</i>

18:58.387 --> 19:01.345
THE SCARABAEI BEETLE.

19:01.432 --> 19:04.470

OF EVERLASTING LIFE.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.176
TELL ME, IF YOU HATE
HER SO MUCH--

19:06.270 --> 19:08.136
WHY DO I STAY?

19:08.189 --> 19:09.429
WHAT ELSE
COULD I DO?

19:09.523 --> 19:12.857
AFTER PAMELA
AND MY HUSB--

19:12.943 --> 19:14.229
GO ON, TELL ME
THE REST.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.810

THOSE OTHER MEN?

19:18.658 --> 19:20.490

CHARLES DAN FORTH?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.491
