WEBVTT

00:01.164 --> 00:03.003
Spence Westmore, you're under arrest

00:03.054 --> 00:05.464
- for the murder of Peri Westmore.
- No, no, he didn't do it!

00:05.515 --> 00:08.999
Maybe Peri told the cult about the
man who drugged and raped her.

00:09.050 --> 00:10.609
I think he's the killer.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.907
There is a video of Peri

00:12.958 --> 00:14.418
being interviewed by The Circle.

00:14.469 --> 00:17.639
If we had it, we can prove
Spence is innocent.

00:17.873 --> 00:18.697
I can't.

00:18.748 --> 00:19.761
The Circle is gone?

00:19.812 --> 00:22.538
Zoila went next door,
and the place was cleaned out.

00:23.002 --> 00:24.752
Oh, my God.
Is that a tunnel?

00:24.803 --> 00:25.768
You coming with me?

00:25.819 --> 00:27.776
- I'm Fiona.
- I thought you were... in Italy.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.466
You must be Zoila, my maid.

00:29.517 --> 00:30.803
I know you're my mother now.

00:30.854 --> 00:32.186
I can't be that for you.

00:32.237 --> 00:34.358
They're casting the movie
based on Marisol's book.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.653
I got a callback.

00:35.704 --> 00:36.695
You did?

00:36.746 --> 00:38.739
Peter.
Husband number three.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.790
I happen to think
you're sexy as hell.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.685
"I didn't know what kind
of flowers you liked,

00:42.736 --> 00:44.198
so I got them all."

00:44.628 --> 00:45.586
Peter."

00:45.637 --> 00:46.762
A little birdie told me

00:46.813 --> 00:49.451
that Marisol got back together
with Jesse.

00:49.502 --> 00:51.958
You were right.
Marisol's seeing her ex again.

00:52.009 --> 00:54.100
I really screwed things up
royally, huh?

00:54.151 --> 00:56.374
I didn't realize you were
so taken with Peter.

00:56.425 --> 00:58.834
Neither did I...
until he was gone.

00:58.885 --> 01:00.285
I'm not usually like this.

01:00.336 --> 01:01.884
It's just Peter.

01:01.935 --> 01:03.970
I never meant to cheat on him.

01:04.021 --> 01:05.498
What happened to you...

01:05.550 --> 01:06.631
that's rape.

01:06.682 --> 01:07.710
Who was it?

01:07.761 --> 01:09.655
Hugh Metzger...
the director.

01:09.706 --> 01:10.789
Mr. Metzger?

01:10.840 --> 01:11.809
Come on in.

01:11.859 --> 01:12.854
I'm leaving you.

01:12.904 --> 01:14.884
Evelyn, we were meant to be together.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.724
Oh! Dear God.

01:16.774 --> 01:18.945
Evelyn is jealous of me and Gail.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.428
You told me your marriage was over.

01:20.479 --> 01:22.182
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.074
I decided to give Evelyn her divorce.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.415
Gail, I am madly in love with you.

01:30.247 --> 01:31.520
Good morning, Evelyn...

01:31.570 --> 01:34.722
and attorney whose name
I will never learn.

01:34.772 --> 01:37.371
Shall we begin
the divorce negotiations?

01:37.421 --> 01:39.129
Will your attorney be joining us?

01:39.179 --> 01:40.864
No, no.
I didn't invite him.

01:40.914 --> 01:45.390
I'm certain we can divide
the assets fairly and amicably.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.625
We'll see how amicable you're feeling

01:47.675 --> 01:50.053
after you have read
my list of demands.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.130
The penthouse in Manhattan.

01:55.180 --> 01:57.129
I spent a great deal of effort
renovating that apart...

01:57.179 --> 01:58.506
It's yours.

01:58.928 --> 02:01.974
Our yacht,<i> The Lady Evelyn...</i>
yours again.

02:02.024 --> 02:03.635
In fact, this all seems acceptable.

02:03.685 --> 02:04.904
Agreed.

02:05.498 --> 02:06.538
Agreed. Agreed.

02:06.588 --> 02:10.857
I know it's not on the list,
but I also want the Manet.

02:10.907 --> 02:13.778
The Manet or the Monet?

02:14.042 --> 02:15.246
Both.

02:15.457 --> 02:16.718
Agreed.

02:16.768 --> 02:18.089
What the hell are you doing?

02:18.139 --> 02:21.026
She means, "Thank you." Yeah.

02:21.604 --> 02:23.886
I'll have the final documents
drawn up immediately.

02:23.936 --> 02:25.002
Wonderful.

02:25.052 --> 02:26.169
See?

02:26.606 --> 02:27.804
Amicable.

02:34.335 --> 02:37.258
Adrian, you have been fighting
this divorce for months,

02:37.308 --> 02:38.707
and suddenly you're just giving up?

02:38.757 --> 02:40.394
It's time for me to move on,

02:40.444 --> 02:43.056
just as you moved on
with Reverend Hamilton.

02:43.584 --> 02:44.502
Yes.

02:44.552 --> 02:47.157
Yes, we are very happy,
but I don't understand.

02:47.207 --> 02:48.256
What turned you around?

02:48.306 --> 02:50.521
Evelyn!
Oh, dear.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.718
This must be
a little bit awkward for you.

02:52.768 --> 02:55.671
Awkward?
Why would it be awkward?

02:55.721 --> 02:57.404
I haven't had the chance
to give her the news.

02:57.454 --> 02:59.509
Oh, let me tell her.

03:00.423 --> 03:02.774
Adrian and I are engaged!

03:03.752 --> 03:06.611
Is that the Powell Family
blood diamond?

03:07.910 --> 03:09.668
Adrian, this is insane.

03:09.718 --> 03:12.567
I assumed you'd be happy.
You're finally free of me.

03:12.617 --> 03:15.763
That's exactly what you want,
isn't it?

03:21.588 --> 03:26.615

03:28.851 --> 03:32.253
Rosie, what do you know
about Peri's killer?

03:32.303 --> 03:33.805
I think he's the same man

03:33.855 --> 03:37.185
who drugged Peri
and raped her years ago...

03:37.404 --> 03:39.191
Tucker's real father.

03:39.339 --> 03:40.363
I can't say who,

03:40.413 --> 03:43.205
but I know someone who's had
a very similar experience,

03:43.255 --> 03:46.537
and the man who assaulted her
was Hugh Metzger.

03:46.587 --> 03:47.838
Get out.

03:47.888 --> 03:49.727
Wait. The jerk
Who's directing your movie?

03:49.777 --> 03:51.559
Do you think he could have
killed Peri?

03:51.609 --> 03:56.144
Miss Shannon said Peri's rapist
was a big shot in the movie industry.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.690
<i>Ay, dios mío.</i>

03:57.740 --> 03:59.960
Danni had a callback with him
last night.

04:02.736 --> 04:04.643
<i>Contesta.</i>
Danni, pick up. Pick up.

04:04.693 --> 04:06.605
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Daniela.

04:06.655 --> 04:07.636
Are you okay?

04:07.686 --> 04:08.744
Yeah, I'm fine.
What's wrong?

04:08.794 --> 04:10.025
Oh, thank God.

04:10.075 --> 04:13.346
Listen to me...
stay away from Hugh Metzger.

04:13.396 --> 04:14.320
What?

04:14.370 --> 04:17.156
He drugs and rapes women,
and he could be a killer, Danni.

04:17.207 --> 04:18.861
Unbelievable!

04:18.911 --> 04:21.752
You're making up these crazy lies
because you're jealous of me.

04:21.802 --> 04:24.275
- I'm protecting you from a rapist.
- Please.

04:24.325 --> 04:26.901
He was super nice to me
at the callback last night.

04:26.951 --> 04:29.844
Well, o-okay. Maybe he's trying
to get you to trust him.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.119
But stay away from him.

04:31.169 --> 04:32.916
And do not drink
anything he gives you.

04:32.966 --> 04:34.752
Promise me, Danni, please.

04:36.221 --> 04:37.460
I promise.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.536
Now I got to go.
<i>Adios.</i>

04:40.216 --> 04:41.455
Who was that?

04:42.160 --> 04:44.218
Oh, just my cousin.

04:45.491 --> 04:47.082
Anyway, let's get back to work.

04:47.132 --> 04:48.159
You know, actually,

04:48.209 --> 04:49.721
I thought we'd take
a little bit of a break,

04:49.771 --> 04:51.860
maybe have a little wine.

04:52.681 --> 04:56.590
Oh, but shouldn't we keep rehearsing
for my big screen test?

04:56.640 --> 04:58.813
Come on.
You've got to loosen up.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.937
You do want the part, don't you?

05:05.346 --> 05:08.021
Genevieve Delatour
for Dr. Selevan.

05:08.071 --> 05:09.208
I'm a bit early.

05:09.258 --> 05:11.287
Oh, may I offer you a beverage
while you wait?

05:11.337 --> 05:13.027
We have sparkling water, champagne.

05:13.077 --> 05:14.373
Champagne?

05:14.423 --> 05:17.000
Oh, I'm so happy
I changed therapists.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.644
Yes, please.

05:21.587 --> 05:25.136
I always get here early
just for the bubbly.

05:25.186 --> 05:26.870
Got to love Beverly Hills.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.951
My waxer offers
complimentary Vicodin.

05:32.045 --> 05:33.811
So, what are you in for?

05:34.925 --> 05:37.044
I recently discovered, uh,

05:37.094 --> 05:40.473
some troubling things
about an incident in my past.

05:40.999 --> 05:42.670
You?
Breakup...

05:43.350 --> 05:44.828
two years ago.

05:45.257 --> 05:48.921
Letting go of relationships is...
It's not my strong suit.

05:48.971 --> 05:51.239
I've been holding onto mine for 20.

05:51.289 --> 05:55.124
Ohh. I love meeting somebody
who's more messed up than me.

05:56.484 --> 05:58.876
Oh, you should probably
leave the bottle.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.066
Oh.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.869
Cheers.

06:05.821 --> 06:07.563
Maids by Marisol.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.956
Yes. Peter. Hello.

06:11.294 --> 06:12.354
Give me the phone.

06:12.404 --> 06:14.167
No. You know I've
been trying to talk to him.

06:14.217 --> 06:15.866
Marisol, you don't under...
Just give me the phone.

06:15.916 --> 06:20.361
Hi. Peter, I have been missing
you like crazy...

06:21.686 --> 06:24.444
Oh. Hi, sir.

06:24.928 --> 06:27.150
Yes, we can find you a maid.

06:27.541 --> 06:29.940
How's Wednesday at 2:00?

06:30.572 --> 06:31.749
Great.

06:33.277 --> 06:35.145
- Wrong Peter?
- Shut up.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.655
I'm gonna go out on a limb

06:36.705 --> 06:39.071
and say you're still not over
your breakup?

06:39.121 --> 06:42.122
What breakup?
Peter has just disappeared.

06:42.172 --> 06:44.104
It's the best relationship
I've ever had,

06:44.154 --> 06:47.070
and I never even got the chance
to say I'm sorry...

06:47.290 --> 06:48.295
or goodbye.

06:48.345 --> 06:50.793
Well, why don't you stop
moping around here then

06:50.843 --> 06:52.777
and go out and find yourself
some closure, already?

06:52.827 --> 06:56.026
God, I envy you, Evelyn.
You seem completely over Adrian.

06:56.076 --> 06:57.229
Ohh!

06:57.279 --> 06:59.948
- Ah, you don't know yet.
- What?

07:00.914 --> 07:04.698
Adrian is marrying...

07:04.748 --> 07:05.718
Gail Fleming.

07:05.768 --> 07:07.357
- What?!
- I don't understand it.

07:07.407 --> 07:08.747
He has always despised her,

07:08.797 --> 07:11.413
and yet they're having
an engagement party

07:11.788 --> 07:14.122
at the mansion tomorrow.

07:14.451 --> 07:16.332
And you're my plus one, by the way.

07:16.382 --> 07:18.376
They invited <i> you?</i>

07:18.426 --> 07:19.551
Seems kind of aggressive.

07:19.601 --> 07:21.238
It's like he's going out of his way

07:21.288 --> 07:22.698
to rub my nose in it.

07:22.748 --> 07:25.071
Oh, maybe he's just trying
to make you jealous.

07:26.158 --> 07:27.894
Oh, my God.

07:28.754 --> 07:29.919
He doesn't want to marry Gail.

07:29.969 --> 07:32.262
He wants me to break them up
and come running back to him.

07:32.699 --> 07:34.298
Sounds like Adrian is playing

07:34.348 --> 07:36.381
a very high-stakes
game of chicken.

07:36.431 --> 07:39.560
If <i> that's</i> what he wants...

07:40.271 --> 07:43.770
then chicken we shall play.

07:44.694 --> 07:45.686
Here it is...

07:45.736 --> 07:47.180
the guest list
from the night of Peri's party.

07:47.230 --> 07:49.548
Thank God you saved this.

07:49.712 --> 07:51.455
What are all the sad faces?

07:51.505 --> 07:53.747
Peri wanted me to keep track of
anyone who didn't bring a gift

07:53.797 --> 07:55.634
so she knew who to publicly shame.

07:57.588 --> 07:59.557
There's his name...
Hugh Metzger.

07:59.607 --> 08:00.766
He <i> was</i> at the party.

08:00.816 --> 08:02.676
Which means
he could have murdered Peri.

08:02.726 --> 08:04.601
I told you.

08:06.021 --> 08:07.862
I'm gonna get Spence out of jail.

08:07.912 --> 08:09.529
Police! Step back!

08:16.148 --> 08:17.254
I got this.

08:17.304 --> 08:19.141
Check in the back.
You two, upstairs. Go.

08:19.191 --> 08:20.730
Detective, what's going on?

08:20.780 --> 08:23.434
I'm gonna ask you this once.
Where is Spence?

08:23.484 --> 08:25.313
I don't understand.
He's not at the prison?

08:25.363 --> 08:27.515
No. He escaped
with another inmate.

08:27.906 --> 08:29.355
Listen, if you're harboring him
here...

08:29.405 --> 08:30.792
I'm not. I swear.

08:30.842 --> 08:32.052
We didn't even know he was missing.

08:32.102 --> 08:33.991
- Is all this really necessary?
- Yes.

08:34.042 --> 08:36.289
Spence Westmore
is an escaped murderer.

08:36.339 --> 08:37.690
We have orders.

08:37.740 --> 08:40.953
Now, if he resists capture,
we will shoot to kill.

08:46.912 --> 08:50.246
I understand why Peter wouldn't
talk to me after what I did.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.187
You didn't do anything.
You were violated.

08:53.237 --> 08:54.765
And Peter was an a-hole

08:54.815 --> 08:56.902
for not even bothering
to find out what happened.

08:56.952 --> 08:59.595
You're right.
Thank you, Lori.

08:59.645 --> 09:03.062
Just reminds me how happy
I am that I'm not into men.

09:03.112 --> 09:04.550
Oh.

09:04.600 --> 09:05.941
You're a lesbian.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.705
Do you enjoy it?

09:08.755 --> 09:10.127
I do.

09:10.177 --> 09:11.898
No male egos.

09:11.948 --> 09:14.696
You don't have to watch
stupid things on TV.

09:14.747 --> 09:17.157
And you end up
with twice the wardrobe.

09:17.207 --> 09:20.959
Oh, well, when you put it like that,
I get the appeal.

09:21.009 --> 09:22.782
Dr. Selevan
is ready for you.

09:22.833 --> 09:26.159
Uh, actually,
I don't need my appointment.

09:26.209 --> 09:28.763
I've just had
The best therapy of my life.

09:29.715 --> 09:30.876
Aww.

09:34.415 --> 09:35.477
Oh, hey, Danni.

09:35.527 --> 09:39.233
Carmen, something bad happened
with Hugh Metzger.

09:39.283 --> 09:40.574
Where are you?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.995
Oh, my God.
Danni, are you okay?

09:45.046 --> 09:47.032
Did he touch you?
You can tell me.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.584
I'll kill him, but you can tell me.

09:48.634 --> 09:50.625
I'm fine, but Hugh's not.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.702
Oh, my God.

09:52.752 --> 09:55.332
- What happened?
- You told me he drugged women,

09:55.382 --> 09:57.902
so I switched our glasses
when he wasn't looking.

09:57.952 --> 09:59.451
Is he dead?

10:00.030 --> 10:02.107
Unfortunately, no.

10:02.530 --> 10:03.878
You did the right thing.

10:03.928 --> 10:06.678
If you hadn't warned me,
he would've done that to me,

10:06.728 --> 10:08.256
- and then...
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

10:08.307 --> 10:10.381
No. You're safe now.
It's okay.

10:10.431 --> 10:11.763
Should we call the police?

10:11.813 --> 10:14.754
No. No. The police are idiots.
They always screw up.

10:14.804 --> 10:16.906
Spence is in jail
while this guy goes free.

10:16.956 --> 10:18.142
No, no, no.

10:18.609 --> 10:19.787
I have an idea.

10:21.070 --> 10:22.637
Okay, the house is all clear,

10:22.687 --> 10:24.421
but Spence may try to make contact.

10:24.472 --> 10:26.875
Spence didn't kill Peri.

10:27.282 --> 10:28.778
But I know who did.

10:28.864 --> 10:30.065
Really?

10:30.115 --> 10:32.604
It was Hugh Metzger, the director.

10:32.654 --> 10:35.201
He drugged Peri and raped her.

10:36.561 --> 10:37.685
What?

10:38.651 --> 10:40.739
Over the years, I have heard rumors

10:40.789 --> 10:43.159
about Mr. Metzger
taking advantage of women.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.708
So, you believe me?

10:44.903 --> 10:49.102
Look, Rosie, even if he is a rapist,
it doesn't mean he's a murderer.

10:49.152 --> 10:52.176
Please.
Spence didn't do this.

10:52.254 --> 10:54.570
Then why is he on the run?

10:56.000 --> 11:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:05.203 --> 11:06.498
Flowers for Peter Hudson.

11:06.548 --> 11:08.273
Yeah, just put them anywhere.

11:10.964 --> 11:13.098
Wait. What's all this?

11:14.024 --> 11:16.397
I didn't know
what kind of flowers you liked,

11:16.819 --> 11:17.911
so I got them all.

11:17.961 --> 11:19.117
You snuck into my office?

11:19.167 --> 11:21.171
It was the only way
I could talk to you.

11:22.611 --> 11:24.152
Peter...

11:24.464 --> 11:27.998
I am so,<i> so</i> sorry.

11:28.048 --> 11:31.008
- For sleeping with your ex?
- I made a huge mistake.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.656
You have every right to be mad at me.

11:32.706 --> 11:34.678
I don't need you to tell me that.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.058
Look...

11:38.690 --> 11:41.726
I can't think of a big enough
way to say I'm sorry.

11:42.031 --> 11:45.348
I would write it across the sky
if I could.

11:46.629 --> 11:50.661
I always sabotage
the good things in my life,

11:50.711 --> 11:53.462
and you were a really good thing.

11:53.512 --> 11:54.989
I loved you.

11:55.850 --> 11:56.979
Peter...

11:57.865 --> 11:59.288
I love you.

12:01.647 --> 12:03.158
Was there anything else?

12:03.349 --> 12:06.515
I just wish we could go back
to the way things were.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.184
Me too.

12:23.970 --> 12:25.444
Zoila, need I remind you

12:25.494 --> 12:28.242
that fetching the post
is the maid's job?

12:28.292 --> 12:29.269
I'm so sorry.

12:29.319 --> 12:33.325
I would have, but you asked me
to hand-steam all your gowns.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.146
Hey, what's the name of that
handsome chap who lives next door?

12:36.196 --> 12:38.014
Kyle. But he moved away.
Why?

12:38.064 --> 12:39.542
Well, apparently he's returned.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.177
I just spied him
through their window.

12:43.644 --> 12:44.982
I'll be right back.

12:46.934 --> 12:48.679
Zoila, where are you going?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.508
Oh, for God's sake.

12:59.911 --> 13:01.139
Hello?

13:01.664 --> 13:02.985
Kyle?

13:10.555 --> 13:11.931
Kyle?

13:12.376 --> 13:13.753
Oh, my God.

13:13.803 --> 13:15.051
Spence!

13:19.009 --> 13:20.728
What are you doing here?

13:20.777 --> 13:22.414
Rosie mentioned that
this house was empty,

13:22.465 --> 13:23.965
and I figured
It was a good place to lay low.

13:24.015 --> 13:27.836
- And why the hell did you break out?
- Because I was ruining Rosie's life.

13:27.886 --> 13:30.023
All she cared about
was proving I was innocent.

13:30.073 --> 13:31.443
And she's about to do it, too!

13:31.493 --> 13:33.298
She's this close
to finding the real killer!

13:33.346 --> 13:34.590
Who's this?

13:34.641 --> 13:35.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:35.763 --> 13:37.912
Put the gun down, Kill Face.

13:38.356 --> 13:40.054
Your name is "Kill Face"?

13:41.657 --> 13:42.871
It suits you.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.367
Where'd you even get that?

13:44.416 --> 13:45.408
Supply run.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.386
She a hostage? She's cute.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.271
No, no, no.

13:49.321 --> 13:50.305
She's a friend.

13:50.355 --> 13:52.033
She might tell the cops about us.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.384
I won't tell anyone.

13:53.434 --> 13:57.028
And you cannot be seen outside,
so let me go,

13:57.077 --> 14:00.161
and I can bring you back
some food and soap.

14:00.648 --> 14:01.972
Come on, man.

14:02.021 --> 14:03.177
Mm.

14:05.304 --> 14:06.881
Rosie really knows who killed Peri?

14:06.930 --> 14:09.088
I think so. But, Spence,
if the police find you,

14:09.139 --> 14:10.866
they're gonna use deadly force.

14:10.915 --> 14:14.323
So Rosie needs to solve
this thing quickly, or...

14:14.373 --> 14:16.000
Yeah. I'm a dead man.

14:22.074 --> 14:23.173
Why am I tied up?

14:23.223 --> 14:24.278
You messed with Danni.

14:24.328 --> 14:27.478
And when you mess with Danni,
you mess with me.

14:27.528 --> 14:30.762
You don't want to mess with her.
She <i> crazy.</i>

14:30.812 --> 14:32.977
You can't do this to me.
Do you know who I am?

14:33.027 --> 14:35.022
You're a monster.

14:35.072 --> 14:36.927
Help! Help!

14:36.977 --> 14:39.497
Stop that!
Nobody can hear you.

14:39.548 --> 14:40.619
We don't want to hurt you.

14:40.669 --> 14:45.478
We just want you to tell the truth
about what you did to Peri Westmore.

14:45.528 --> 14:47.793
Well, I-I-I didn't do anything
to her.

14:47.843 --> 14:50.885
I think he needs some help
jogging his memory.

14:50.935 --> 14:53.226
This is oven cleaner.

14:53.277 --> 14:55.755
"Avoid contact
with eyes and skin."

14:55.804 --> 14:57.306
- I wonder why it says that.
- <i>Ay.</i>

14:57.355 --> 14:58.656
Huh?

14:58.705 --> 15:00.987
Aah!
You crazy bitch!

15:01.037 --> 15:02.256
You can stop this.

15:02.306 --> 15:04.768
All you have to do
is tell us what you did.

15:06.537 --> 15:07.919
Spray him more.
Go ahead.

15:07.970 --> 15:10.173
Spray as much as you want.
I'm not saying another word.

15:10.674 --> 15:13.150
Okay. Let's try this
some other way.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.170
Ohh.

15:17.401 --> 15:21.286
Geez!
Who the hell are you people?

15:21.336 --> 15:24.701
We're maids,
and we're not messing around!

15:24.750 --> 15:26.485
Now start talking.

15:28.377 --> 15:31.776
Evelyn, thanks again for letting
us have the engagement party here.

15:31.826 --> 15:35.297
Please. Not being consulted
made it an easy decision.

15:35.347 --> 15:38.781
But still, you're being such
a good sport about all this.

15:38.831 --> 15:41.813
Well, I've been trying
to divorce Adrian for a year.

15:41.863 --> 15:44.106
I should be thanking you.

15:44.156 --> 15:45.504
In fact...

15:46.315 --> 15:48.073
I just had the craziest thought.

15:48.123 --> 15:52.949
What if we turned the engagement
party into a surprise wedding?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.912
Marry Adrian tomorrow?

15:54.960 --> 15:59.106
Gail, you have got
to lock him down A.S.A.P.

15:59.155 --> 16:00.523
I don't mean to sound indelicate,

16:00.574 --> 16:02.859
but Adrian does have a wandering eye.

16:03.382 --> 16:04.643
Well, an impromptu wedding

16:04.693 --> 16:07.521
would be a wonderful surprise
for everyone.

16:07.572 --> 16:10.386
And you know who else
would <i> love</i> the idea?

16:11.237 --> 16:12.418
Adrian.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.251
I think I know what this is about.

16:16.534 --> 16:18.304
And just because
Marisol and I broke up

16:18.354 --> 16:20.786
does not mean that you and I
will be getting back together.

16:20.835 --> 16:24.665
I see your self-esteem
is as robust as ever.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.880
But I wanted to see you
to tell you...

16:28.582 --> 16:30.772
it's over between us.

16:30.822 --> 16:33.122
It's been over for 20 years.

16:33.173 --> 16:34.476
Not for me.

16:34.913 --> 16:37.917
I've been carrying a torch
for you all this time.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.918
But I finally realized
that you were a real...

16:42.798 --> 16:44.012
a-hole.

16:44.061 --> 16:45.481
I'm not the one who cheated.

16:45.531 --> 16:47.118
I didn't cheat.

16:47.516 --> 16:49.345
But you didn't even
stick around long enough

16:49.396 --> 16:51.411
to hear my side of the story.

16:51.966 --> 16:53.129
Okay.

16:53.738 --> 16:54.912
Do you want to tell me now?

16:54.961 --> 16:57.793
I didn't come here
to rehash the past.

16:58.838 --> 17:01.930
I came here to tell you
that you made a mistake.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.427
You ran away.

17:03.478 --> 17:06.574
And it seems to me you're doing
the same thing with Marisol.

17:08.011 --> 17:11.282
You already threw away
one great love.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.476
Do you really want
to throw away another one?

17:17.121 --> 17:20.657
Thankfully,
Peri didn't tell the police...

17:20.991 --> 17:22.287
what I did to her.

17:22.336 --> 17:25.787
You mean drugging her?
Raping her?

17:26.329 --> 17:27.563
Getting her pregnant?

17:27.612 --> 17:31.155
- You're gonna pay for that.
- Well, trust me, I have...

17:31.319 --> 17:32.337
through the nose.

17:32.388 --> 17:34.120
What do you mean?

17:34.170 --> 17:36.838
The Circle, the...
the cult that Peri joined...

17:36.888 --> 17:40.091
she told them everything, and...
and they've been using it against me.

17:40.611 --> 17:42.494
Because they had it all on video.

17:42.544 --> 17:43.999
They blackmailed me.

17:44.050 --> 17:46.298
I've been bankrolling the cult
for years.

17:46.347 --> 17:48.458
What about
the night of Peri's murder?

17:48.623 --> 17:51.683
- You were at her party.
- I was, and that night

17:51.732 --> 17:54.335
Peri saw something
that she shouldn't have.

17:55.350 --> 17:58.264
- Do you know where Ben is?
- Uh, I'll check downstairs.

17:58.314 --> 17:59.586
Ben!

18:02.191 --> 18:03.729
Oh, my God.

18:03.780 --> 18:05.216
Uh, Peri...

18:05.266 --> 18:08.357
<i>Peri knew exactly
what was going on in that room</i>

18:08.407 --> 18:10.962
<i>because I'd done the same thing
to her years before.</i>

18:11.011 --> 18:12.384
Peri, you were looking for me?

18:12.434 --> 18:13.362
Call the police.

18:13.411 --> 18:15.320
He was about to rape some poor girl.

18:15.370 --> 18:18.798
<i>Peri had always thought
she was the only one.</i>

18:18.847 --> 18:21.104
<i>But that night,
she realized there were others.</i>

18:21.153 --> 18:23.060
Okay, Peri, we can work this out.

18:23.110 --> 18:25.310
You son of a bitch.
You are done hurting women.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.588
Done!

18:27.962 --> 18:29.741
You can't let her talk.
I'll be ruined.

18:29.790 --> 18:31.633
Relax. We'll handle Peri.

18:31.682 --> 18:34.006
You know how valuable you are to us.

18:34.055 --> 18:36.260
I saw the look in Peri's eye.

18:36.674 --> 18:38.861
She wanted my head on a platter.

18:39.234 --> 18:43.253
And that's why you killed her...
to keep her quiet.

18:43.304 --> 18:44.808
I didn't kill Peri.

18:45.939 --> 18:47.978
No! No! No! No! No! No!
It's the truth!

18:48.029 --> 18:50.897
Look, I mean, why would I
confess to everything else

18:50.947 --> 18:52.510
and not this?

18:53.072 --> 18:55.538
Look, I know it looks bad,

18:55.588 --> 18:56.890
but the night of her party,

18:56.940 --> 18:58.451
she got into a big fight with her ex.

18:58.502 --> 19:00.699
I mean, he killed her...
uh, Spence Westmore.

19:00.748 --> 19:03.439
Spence is innocent.
He was framed.

19:03.489 --> 19:06.099
- Well, I didn't murder her.
- Come on.

19:06.149 --> 19:08.499
Peri was killed
to protect your secrets.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.897
If you didn't kill her,
who else would?

19:13.791 --> 19:14.981
Oh, my God.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.245
What?

19:16.294 --> 19:17.950
No, she wouldn't.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.328
She? Who's she? Peri?

19:25.197 --> 19:28.069
Guys, h-he doesn't look
so good.

19:28.118 --> 19:29.598
My chest.

19:29.804 --> 19:32.159
<i>Dios mío,</i> he's...
he's having a heart attack!

19:32.209 --> 19:33.620
Aah!

19:40.000 --> 19:41.711
What on earth are you doing?

19:41.761 --> 19:45.830
Oh, um, this is food
that I'm taking to my mom

19:45.880 --> 19:47.347
because she's dying.

19:48.476 --> 19:50.526
What a wretched little life you lead.

19:51.503 --> 19:53.213
Take out the rubbish as you go.

20:01.672 --> 20:04.013
Fiona, did you throw out my mail?

20:04.063 --> 20:05.825
You shouldn't have your letters
sent here.

20:05.875 --> 20:07.090
This is my house.

20:07.140 --> 20:08.636
I live here, too.

20:08.686 --> 20:11.157
No. You work here.
There's a difference.

20:18.543 --> 20:21.327
"Sorry how things ended.
I'm really not a bad guy.

20:21.377 --> 20:23.324
Hope this helps. Kyle."

20:28.796 --> 20:30.695
Oh, my God.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.104
Hugh Metzger had a heart attack?

20:33.154 --> 20:36.891
Yes, so we untied him,
called the paramedics, and ran.

20:36.941 --> 20:38.095
Why didn't you report it
to the police?

20:38.145 --> 20:41.863
He killed Peri. I think he's
protecting the real killer.

20:41.913 --> 20:43.701
He said something about a woman.

20:43.751 --> 20:45.094
Rosie!

20:46.982 --> 20:48.100
What's wrong?

20:48.150 --> 20:49.902
First, Spence is okay.

20:49.952 --> 20:52.369
- What?
- He's hiding out in Kyle's attic.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.705
<i>Ay, dios.</i>
I got to go see him.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.024
No, no!
The police are watching you.

20:57.074 --> 21:00.226
And besides, Kyle sent me something
you need to see right away.

21:00.630 --> 21:01.616
You put it in your bra?

21:01.666 --> 21:03.788
Don't start. I'm having a day. Okay.

21:05.631 --> 21:06.807
Is that...

21:07.299 --> 21:10.224
The video you've been looking
for... Peri's secrets.

21:14.853 --> 21:17.224
Hey. How are you doing?

21:17.763 --> 21:19.123
Okay.

21:20.561 --> 21:23.440
But I realized
How awful I've been to you,

21:23.550 --> 21:26.479
so I brought you this
to say I'm sorry.

21:26.529 --> 21:28.832
Aww. That's so s...

21:28.882 --> 21:32.315
Hey. This is my bracelet.

21:32.365 --> 21:37.068
The point is that you were there
for me when I needed you.

21:37.440 --> 21:38.980
I care about you...

21:39.519 --> 21:40.609
a lot.

21:40.659 --> 21:43.460
I could tell.
You got pretty crazy with Hugh.

21:43.510 --> 21:47.156
Well, nobody messes with Carmen Luna.

21:49.357 --> 21:50.709
Or her daughter.

21:52.605 --> 21:55.184
- You just called me your...
- I know. I know.

21:57.019 --> 21:59.013
Why don't we start over?

22:00.295 --> 22:02.026
No lies...

22:02.076 --> 22:04.512
or secrets or fighting.

22:05.684 --> 22:07.733
Just a real relationship.

22:09.310 --> 22:11.004
That sounds really nice.

22:14.494 --> 22:16.986
You know, it's too bad
that your birth father

22:17.036 --> 22:18.419
isn't here to see this.

22:22.584 --> 22:25.885
I just hope Lucas is smiling
down on us from heaven.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.735
Mm-hmm.

22:31.178 --> 22:33.633
More flowers, Cherie.

22:33.683 --> 22:36.519
After all, this is
a celebration of undying love

22:36.569 --> 22:39.293
between my husband
and a close friend of mine.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.441
Evelyn, did you convince Gail

22:42.491 --> 22:45.365
to turn this party into a wedding?

22:45.415 --> 22:48.938
Isn't this what you wanted...
to marry Gail Fleming?

22:49.738 --> 22:51.064
Of course it is.

22:51.114 --> 22:53.982
Unfortunately, you and I have yet
to sign the divorce documents,

22:54.032 --> 22:57.051
so, sadly, there can be
no wedding today.

22:57.101 --> 22:58.905
Oh, darn.

22:58.955 --> 23:00.172
But now that I think of it,

23:00.222 --> 23:01.889
I have the divorce documents
right inside.

23:01.939 --> 23:03.408
We just need to sign them.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.038
That is wonderful.

23:06.088 --> 23:07.714
If only it were that simple.

23:07.764 --> 23:10.309
The documents have to be signed
in front of a notary public.

23:10.359 --> 23:11.989
Judge Winslow is on the guest list.

23:12.039 --> 23:14.094
If we catch him
as the party's starting,

23:14.144 --> 23:15.682
he can make it official.

23:17.322 --> 23:18.697
Excellent idea...

23:19.502 --> 23:21.847
because I <i> really</i> want to marry Gail.

23:21.897 --> 23:23.028
Good...

23:23.078 --> 23:25.737
because it is <i> really</i> happening.

23:30.104 --> 23:31.564
<i>...not even cute at all...</i>

23:31.614 --> 23:34.105
How's it going with Peri's
video? Learn anything?

23:34.155 --> 23:36.382
Just that Peri
loves to talk about herself.

23:36.432 --> 23:37.835
It's nine hours long.

23:37.885 --> 23:39.974
What could she possibly talk
about for nine hours?

23:40.024 --> 23:41.106
Mm.

23:41.156 --> 23:42.720
<i>So, now it's sophomore year,</i>

23:42.770 --> 23:46.725
<i>and my roommate</i>
<i>is this awful girl named Tamar.</i>

23:46.775 --> 23:48.248
<i>She snores like an animal,</i>

23:48.298 --> 23:49.560
<i>but of course I can't say anything</i>

23:49.610 --> 23:51.127
<i>because she's in a wheelchair.</i>

23:51.177 --> 23:52.413
Oh, boy.

23:52.463 --> 23:53.863
Maybe just scroll forward

23:53.913 --> 23:55.935
until she gets emotional?

23:57.293 --> 23:58.531
Wait. There.

23:59.086 --> 24:00.634
Is she crying?

24:00.907 --> 24:02.397
This could be it.

24:03.052 --> 24:05.771
<i>I was terrified</i>
<i>that Spence would find out</i>

24:05.821 --> 24:07.317
<i>the baby wasn't his.</i>

24:08.520 --> 24:11.193
<i>I knew I had to come forward</i>
<i>about the rape,</i>

24:12.312 --> 24:16.049
<i>so I called Hugh and I told him</i>
<i>I was turning him in.</i>

24:17.425 --> 24:18.691
<i>But you never did?</i>

24:20.463 --> 24:22.438
<i>Well, the strangest thing happened.</i>

24:23.602 --> 24:26.001
<i>Hugh's daughter showed up</i>
<i>with an offer.</i>

24:26.423 --> 24:28.121
<i>In return for my silence,</i>

24:28.171 --> 24:30.792
<i>Hugh would turn me</i>
<i>into a giant movie star.</i>

24:31.463 --> 24:33.906
<i>He sent his daughter</i>
<i>to do his dirty work?</i>

24:34.446 --> 24:36.834
<i>Man, she was desperate to shut me up.</i>

24:37.450 --> 24:40.769
<i>She obviously didn't want to see</i>
<i>her family dragged through the mud.</i>

24:42.074 --> 24:45.858
Hugh's daughter
really wanted to protect him.

24:46.765 --> 24:49.173
Maybe that's the woman
Hugh was talking about.

24:49.223 --> 24:51.494
Well, he's a public figure.

24:51.544 --> 24:53.681
Shouldn't be that hard to figure
out who his daughter is.

24:53.731 --> 24:57.208
Can you imagine finding out
your father raped somebody

24:57.258 --> 24:58.962
and covering it up for him?

24:59.012 --> 25:00.702
She must be evil.

25:00.752 --> 25:03.431
Oh, she's evil, all right.

25:06.290 --> 25:08.022
You got to be kidding me.

25:10.159 --> 25:12.077
Your father's stable,
and he's resting now.

25:12.127 --> 25:13.684
We'll call you when he wakes up.

25:13.734 --> 25:15.766
In the meantime,
You should go home and rest.

25:15.816 --> 25:17.200
He's in good hands.

25:17.681 --> 25:19.157
Thank you so much.

25:20.282 --> 25:22.291
My dad means everything to me.

25:25.572 --> 25:27.817
<i>Officials say there are no new leads</i>

25:27.867 --> 25:31.060
<i>in the search for escaped</i>
<i>inmates Spence Westmore</i>

25:31.110 --> 25:33.953
<i>and Stewart "Kill Face" Pearlman.</i>

25:34.003 --> 25:35.478
Zoila!

25:36.544 --> 25:38.679
Yes, Fiona?

25:38.729 --> 25:41.142
That's the man I saw,
the one on the left.

25:41.192 --> 25:43.123
I thought he was the neighbor.

25:43.352 --> 25:46.749
Peri Westmore's murderer
is hiding next door.

25:46.799 --> 25:49.034
No, that's crazy.

25:49.084 --> 25:51.001
I know what I saw.
I'm ringing the police.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.431
Fetch my mobile.

25:53.530 --> 25:57.003
Zoila, my phone... now.

25:58.596 --> 26:00.541
Hand it over this instant.

26:01.906 --> 26:05.318
Oh, for God's sake.
Do you want to be fired?

26:06.879 --> 26:08.010
Yes.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.597
Who's ready to get a divorce?

26:14.647 --> 26:16.613
The line forms behind me.

26:16.663 --> 26:17.602
How are you, Judge?

26:17.652 --> 26:21.483
A little confused by the enthusiasm,
but otherwise fine.

26:21.533 --> 26:23.902
Evelyn, I have something for you.

26:26.582 --> 26:28.171
The 1932 Riesling

26:28.221 --> 26:30.003
salvaged from
The crash of the Hindenburg.

26:30.053 --> 26:31.692
You gave it to me
on our wedding night...

26:31.742 --> 26:33.791
such a romantic gesture.

26:34.579 --> 26:37.399
We were supposed to drink that
on our 50th anniversary.

26:37.449 --> 26:39.491
But we'll never see 50 years now,

26:39.541 --> 26:42.876
so I thought I would use it to
toast the end of our marriage...

26:42.926 --> 26:45.877
unless that would be
too upsetting for you.

26:47.063 --> 26:50.083
Nope.
Crack that bitch open.

26:50.133 --> 26:54.058
Well, if you two are done
with whatever the hell this is,

26:54.108 --> 26:56.334
can we get these signed?

26:56.384 --> 26:58.122
- Who's first?
- I'll go.

27:03.132 --> 27:04.305
There.

27:05.604 --> 27:06.886
Your turn.

27:15.984 --> 27:17.404
Done.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.469
You're divorced.
Congratulations.

27:23.133 --> 27:27.678
Well, I must say, I feel an
indescribable sense of relief.

27:28.459 --> 27:30.481
I didn't enjoy a single day
of our marriage.

27:30.531 --> 27:34.322
Please! If anyone was miserable,
I can assure you it was I.

27:34.372 --> 27:36.070
On three distinct occasions,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.409
I considered suffocating you
with a pillow.

27:38.459 --> 27:39.719
It's a shame you didn't.

27:39.769 --> 27:42.200
I lay awake most nights
praying for death.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.707
Dear God,

27:43.757 --> 27:45.578
I despise you.

27:45.628 --> 27:47.252
And I you.

27:49.696 --> 27:50.828
Oh!

28:01.684 --> 28:03.182
Gail!

28:03.232 --> 28:04.717
The party started an hour ago.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.732
Where have you been?
Marisol, it is awful.

28:06.782 --> 28:08.616
My father had a heart attack.

28:08.666 --> 28:10.526
We didn't have enough time
to cancel the party.

28:10.576 --> 28:12.735
I would feel so much better
if I could just find...

28:12.785 --> 28:14.021
Adrian?

28:14.071 --> 28:15.454
I was gonna say a bar.

28:15.503 --> 28:18.400
Gail, can I offer you a cocktail?

28:18.611 --> 28:19.814
Thank you.

28:20.392 --> 28:23.303
You really should find Adrian.
He'll take care of you.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.508
Yes, yes.
He's in the study.

28:25.558 --> 28:26.747
Great. Thank you.

28:30.902 --> 28:32.383
Adrian?

28:32.433 --> 28:34.386
Adrian, are you in here?

28:35.731 --> 28:37.239
Adrian?

28:38.149 --> 28:40.452
No, he's not.

28:41.014 --> 28:41.966
Who are you?

28:42.016 --> 28:45.157
I'm Genevieve Delatour's maid.
We've met before.

28:45.207 --> 28:46.179
Are you working the party?

28:46.229 --> 28:47.761
'Cause you really
shouldn't be in here.

28:47.811 --> 28:49.871
But I need to talk to you...

28:50.246 --> 28:52.649
about Peri Westmore.

28:52.699 --> 28:55.022
Never met her.
Such a tragedy.

28:55.072 --> 28:56.792
Oh, I knew her.

28:56.842 --> 29:00.483
And so did my husband...
Spence Westmore.

29:00.533 --> 29:03.135
- The man who killed her?
- Oh, he didn't kill her.

29:03.185 --> 29:04.368
You did.

29:05.179 --> 29:07.355
I know what happened that night.

29:07.405 --> 29:11.072
You were protecting your father,
Hugh Metzger.

29:11.121 --> 29:13.850
Okay. Well,
you are clearly deranged

29:13.900 --> 29:15.746
or mentally challenged...

29:15.796 --> 29:17.019
maybe both.

29:17.069 --> 29:18.734
Peri walked in on him that night,

29:18.784 --> 29:21.429
alone with an unconscious woman.

29:22.203 --> 29:23.305
How do you know about that?

29:23.355 --> 29:25.274
He was worried
Peri would go to the police,

29:25.324 --> 29:29.753
so he confided in the one person
who loved him unconditionally...

29:30.167 --> 29:31.508
you.

29:31.558 --> 29:35.023
Most daughters would be horrified to
hear about such things, but not you.

29:35.073 --> 29:36.790
You helped him cover before.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.643
But she said
she's going to the police.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.411
What? No, she can't do that.
We had a deal.

29:40.461 --> 29:42.757
Well, she doesn't care anymore.

29:42.807 --> 29:45.309
Okay, I will talk to her.

29:45.359 --> 29:49.134
Daddy, I promise, by morning,
this will all be over.

29:49.184 --> 29:51.332
So you raced over
in the middle of the night

29:51.382 --> 29:53.637
to convince Peri to keep quiet,

29:53.687 --> 29:55.460
just like you convinced her before.

29:55.510 --> 29:59.253
But this time,
she couldn't be bought.

29:59.303 --> 30:02.224
I'm gonna tell the whole world
your daddy's a rapist,

30:02.274 --> 30:04.996
and there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

30:05.464 --> 30:07.920
Now get the hell out of my house.

30:08.416 --> 30:13.292
You had to stop her,
Or your family would be ruined.

30:23.975 --> 30:25.505
What are you doing?!

30:26.067 --> 30:27.300
Aah!

30:44.044 --> 30:45.628
Huh.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.813
Guess there was something
I could do about it.

30:49.397 --> 30:52.097
The next morning,
Spence found her body,

30:52.147 --> 30:53.836
and the police blamed him.

30:53.886 --> 30:55.983
They never thought
to look anywhere else.

30:57.935 --> 31:01.196
Well, did I get it right?

31:03.721 --> 31:04.819
You did.

31:04.869 --> 31:06.164
Oh, God.

31:06.214 --> 31:07.987
You don't even know how long
I've been waiting

31:08.037 --> 31:09.547
to say it out loud.

31:09.597 --> 31:11.419
I killed Peri Westmore.

31:11.469 --> 31:12.802
You're proud of it?

31:12.852 --> 31:13.753
Uh, yeah.

31:13.803 --> 31:16.143
As far as I'm concerned, killing
Peri was a public service.

31:16.193 --> 31:18.114
They should pin a medal on me,
really.

31:18.164 --> 31:19.912
I'm just surprised.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.290
I figured you wouldn't want
to tell me the truth.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.424
Come on.
I mean, who's gonna believe you?

31:24.474 --> 31:26.772
You're nothing but a dumb maid.

31:27.388 --> 31:30.162
- I believe her.
- What the hell?

31:30.212 --> 31:31.584
Gail Metzger Fleming,

31:31.634 --> 31:33.751
you are under arrest
for the murder of Peri Westmore.

31:33.801 --> 31:34.967
You have the right to remain silent.

31:35.017 --> 31:36.916
W-W-Wait.
What is going on?

31:36.966 --> 31:39.987
I went to Detective Shaw
with my suspicions about you.

31:40.037 --> 31:41.870
Yeah. We figured you wouldn't
confess to the police.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.936
But maybe you wouldn't worry
about telling me.

31:43.986 --> 31:47.639
After all, I'm just a dumb maid.

31:49.064 --> 31:50.707
You two set me up.

31:50.757 --> 31:53.794
Yes, we did.
Enjoy jail, Gail.

31:53.844 --> 31:55.176
"Jail Gail"...

31:55.226 --> 31:57.133
that could be your prison name.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.879
All right, take her away.

32:02.122 --> 32:05.467
Rosie, thank you
so much for your help.

32:05.517 --> 32:07.335
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you sooner.

32:07.385 --> 32:10.342
I'm just glad Spence
can finally come home.

32:15.388 --> 32:17.954
Listen. Listen to me.
You have to turn yourself in.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.822
The police will be here any minute.

32:19.872 --> 32:22.889
You snitched on us!
No, no. My boss did.

32:24.260 --> 32:26.211
Liar.
She sold us out.

32:26.261 --> 32:28.054
Oh, hey, hey. Okay,
we got to... we got to be smart.

32:28.104 --> 32:29.130
She's got to pay for this.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.381
I swear I'm only trying to help you!

32:31.431 --> 32:33.295
I'm not going back to prison.

32:33.345 --> 32:34.448
Oh!

32:34.498 --> 32:36.319
Spence, stop!

32:45.959 --> 32:47.165
Spence!

32:48.736 --> 32:51.308
Spence! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

32:51.358 --> 32:52.414
Oh, my God. Okay.

32:52.464 --> 32:54.812
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm gonna call for help.

32:56.551 --> 32:58.400
Copy that.
We're still at the scene.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.039
Spence was shot?

33:03.089 --> 33:05.660
- They're bringing him down now.
- The shooter's still at large.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.448
We're searching the neighborhood.

33:07.939 --> 33:09.112
Spence!

33:12.230 --> 33:13.353
Are you all right?

33:13.404 --> 33:15.242
- I think so.
- He's very lucky.

33:15.292 --> 33:17.555
The bullet didn't hit
any vital organs.

33:18.758 --> 33:20.700
Does he have to wear these handcuffs?

33:20.750 --> 33:22.156
Spence is innocent.

33:22.206 --> 33:24.056
He still broke out of prison.

33:24.678 --> 33:27.782
But Kill Face forced you to escape.

33:28.264 --> 33:29.702
Isn't that right?

33:30.488 --> 33:33.173
Yes, yes, he did.

33:33.223 --> 33:34.580
I was a hostage.

33:34.630 --> 33:37.467
He shot you when you tried
to get away from him.

33:37.517 --> 33:39.453
Rosie, I witnessed it all.

33:39.503 --> 33:40.873
Are we buying this?

33:41.711 --> 33:44.994
He's been through enough.
Take off the cuffs.

33:45.065 --> 33:46.685
We have to get him to the hospital.

33:46.735 --> 33:49.079
Not without my wife.

33:59.822 --> 34:01.831
Your fly is unzipped.

34:01.881 --> 34:05.305
Oh, well, that would be awkward
at my engagement party,

34:05.355 --> 34:06.737
wouldn't it?

34:06.787 --> 34:08.159
What's going on?

34:08.210 --> 34:10.516
Why are the police here?

34:10.567 --> 34:12.396
How long did we make love?

34:12.446 --> 34:15.833
Based on history,
no longer than 11 minutes.

34:15.884 --> 34:17.518
Carmen, what happened?

34:17.569 --> 34:20.172
Tell me no one was killed
or dismembered.

34:20.222 --> 34:23.190
Our parties really <i> do</i> have
a terrible track record.

34:23.239 --> 34:26.849
The police arrested Gail
for killing Peri Westmore,

34:26.899 --> 34:29.072
and the party kind of died
after that.

34:29.963 --> 34:31.458
Wow.

34:31.507 --> 34:33.103
Gail is a murderer?

34:33.154 --> 34:36.005
I'm oddly unfazed by this.

34:36.054 --> 34:38.585
It looks like I won't be
marrying her after all.

34:40.231 --> 34:42.949
At least you still have
the Reverend Hamilton.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.556
He dumped me.

34:44.607 --> 34:46.420
It's for the best.

34:46.469 --> 34:50.042
He's a wonderful man.
It never would have worked.

34:55.436 --> 34:59.093
Well, I'm not involved with anyone,
and you're not, either.

35:00.913 --> 35:02.972
But we signed the divorce papers.

35:03.022 --> 35:05.125
We can tear those up.

35:05.175 --> 35:07.595
So, where does that leave us?

35:08.724 --> 35:11.351
Are we married or not?

35:15.050 --> 35:17.427
That's wonderful, Rosie.

35:18.243 --> 35:19.873
Give Spence my love.

35:19.923 --> 35:21.343
Okay, bye.

35:24.143 --> 35:25.511
Peter.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.737
What are you doing here?

35:27.787 --> 35:30.621
Well, I saw you on the news
when Gail Fleming was arrested.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.104
Oh.

35:32.154 --> 35:35.130
Figured it was the universe
giving me a kick in the pants.

35:35.451 --> 35:36.503
What?

35:36.553 --> 35:40.731
I've been acting like a big baby.

35:41.396 --> 35:43.215
But I was hurt.

35:43.266 --> 35:46.218
See, when I was in New York,
I bought a ring.

35:48.201 --> 35:49.293
Oh, my God.

35:49.344 --> 35:53.304
I realized that I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with you.

35:53.799 --> 35:56.602
And then I came back and found out
that you didn't feel the same way.

35:56.652 --> 35:59.185
But I did. I do.

35:59.235 --> 36:03.059
It just didn't seem
that you felt the same way.

36:04.823 --> 36:06.561
Peter, I made the biggest mistake.

36:06.611 --> 36:10.466
Well, I don't want to make
a bigger one by letting you go.

36:12.425 --> 36:13.667
So...

36:13.717 --> 36:14.958
What is happening?

36:15.008 --> 36:17.319
Well, it's an engagement party.

36:17.757 --> 36:20.063
<i>Someone</i> should be getting engaged.

36:21.835 --> 36:24.534
Marisol Suarez, will you marry me?

36:24.584 --> 36:26.361
Yes.

36:27.479 --> 36:28.758
Oh, Peter.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.433
Oh!

36:41.290 --> 36:43.889
You got fired?
It was for the best.

36:43.939 --> 36:46.017
But having a boss like Fiona
made me see

36:46.067 --> 36:47.357
that you're not so bad after all.

36:47.407 --> 36:49.259
That's what I always told you.

36:49.309 --> 36:52.337
So, I was thinking maybe...

36:52.387 --> 36:54.203
You want your job back?

36:55.149 --> 36:59.305
Oh, I'm so, so happy!

37:00.947 --> 37:02.210
Wait.

37:02.260 --> 37:03.631
Your key.

37:04.711 --> 37:05.891
Here.

37:06.539 --> 37:09.188
And you better never
give it back to me.

37:09.238 --> 37:10.430
Deal.

37:10.480 --> 37:14.246
But I do think we need to set
some ground rules first.

37:14.296 --> 37:16.483
No meddling in each other's lives.

37:16.533 --> 37:17.482
You're right.

37:17.532 --> 37:20.506
From now on, you do you,
and I'll do me.

37:20.556 --> 37:22.624
Look at you with the lingo.

37:24.118 --> 37:26.962
Oh, I'll get it.
I have a date.

37:27.012 --> 37:30.111
And I'm not gonna ask who he is
because I'm not meddling.

37:31.593 --> 37:32.439
Cute dress.

37:32.489 --> 37:34.401
Ooh, I'm totally gonna borrow that.

37:35.062 --> 37:37.204
Zoila, this is Lori...

37:37.254 --> 37:38.488
my date.

37:38.934 --> 37:40.239
Your date?

37:40.887 --> 37:42.068
Lori.

37:42.780 --> 37:44.976
I've always been unlucky in love,

37:45.026 --> 37:49.725
so maybe, after five husbands,
what I need is a wife.

37:57.631 --> 37:59.141
Have fun.

37:59.368 --> 38:01.656
Daddy!
We missed you!

38:01.706 --> 38:03.071
Ohh!

38:03.121 --> 38:06.627
Easy,<i> chiquitos.</i>
Your daddy's still healing.

38:06.677 --> 38:07.842
Oh, no, that's okay.

38:07.892 --> 38:11.845
I really missed you guys, too,
but I promise I am back now for good.

38:13.618 --> 38:16.391
We're glad to have you back, boss.
-Oh!

38:16.441 --> 38:18.718
Jesse, can you grab the boys
some lunch?

38:18.768 --> 38:20.093
I need to talk to Spence.

38:20.143 --> 38:23.343
'Course. Come on, guys.
I'll make some nuggets.

38:23.393 --> 38:25.018
What do you need to talk to me about?

38:25.068 --> 38:26.329
It's not Shannon, is it?

38:26.379 --> 38:27.571
She doesn't want to stay here,
does she?

38:27.621 --> 38:29.603
No, no, no, it's not that.

38:29.653 --> 38:31.900
She already packed up and went home.

38:32.948 --> 38:34.852
Well, why are you so serious?

38:35.587 --> 38:38.735
Is it one of the boys?
Miguel? Tucker?

38:40.408 --> 38:43.572
I've been waiting to tell you
till you got home.

38:44.018 --> 38:46.696
Well, just tell me.
I can handle it.

38:47.033 --> 38:51.403
I know you think of Tucker
as your baby boy, but...

38:52.271 --> 38:53.414
What?

38:57.504 --> 38:59.654
Tucker's gonna be a big brother.

39:00.132 --> 39:01.570
Miguel, too.

39:01.948 --> 39:03.323
You're pregnant?

39:05.417 --> 39:08.713
I guess we weren't too careful
on those conjugal visits.

39:09.744 --> 39:11.212
Are you happy?

39:11.298 --> 39:13.564
Oh, I've never been happier
in my whole life.

39:14.205 --> 39:18.154
- I love you, Rosie.
- I love you, too.

39:19.144 --> 39:20.968
Mr. Spence.

39:33.524 --> 39:36.288
Ay, Peter looks so handsome.

39:36.338 --> 39:38.844
- And he is crazy about Marisol.
- Mmhmm.

39:38.894 --> 39:40.195
They're so good together.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.800
Hey, it took me 40 minutes

39:41.850 --> 39:43.044
to get my makeup to look like this.

39:43.094 --> 39:44.315
Nobody make me cry.

39:44.365 --> 39:46.473
It took you 40 minutes to do <i> that?</i>

39:46.523 --> 39:48.295
I'm gonna make <i>you</i> cry.

39:55.661 --> 39:56.685
Rosie.

39:56.735 --> 39:59.279
Oh! Sorry.

39:59.329 --> 40:00.510
Spence and the baby say hi.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.157
Ay, enough with the baby.
We're here to party.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.470
Open bar!

40:19.549 --> 40:21.199
Where is she?

40:25.794 --> 40:28.826
I'm sorry.
We need a moment.

40:35.893 --> 40:37.507
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

40:37.557 --> 40:39.455
She was supposed to be
right behind me.

40:45.781 --> 40:47.231
Marisol?

40:49.933 --> 40:51.325
What the hell?

40:54.495 --> 40:55.808
Where'd she go?

40:57.217 --> 40:58.625
"I'm sorry"?

41:00.257 --> 41:01.705
Marisol got cold feet?

41:01.755 --> 41:03.918
I thought she was happy with Peter.

41:07.346 --> 41:08.527
Girls...

41:20.186 --> 41:22.690
Is that... blood?

41:27.629 --> 41:30.167
I don't think she got cold feet.
