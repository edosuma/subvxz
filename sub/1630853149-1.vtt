01:16.759 --> 01:18.159
Have a beautiful night.

01:18.159 --> 01:20.837

02:41.651 --> 02:42.920
- Uh...

02:42.920 --> 02:44.810
- Come on, it's Patron!

02:44.810 --> 02:46.830
- Sure, thanks.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.020
- [Chip] Cheers!

02:48.020 --> 02:49.320
- Cheers.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.000
- So you're ridesharing?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.620
- Yeah. I don't even own a car.

02:52.620 --> 02:53.670
- Did you know those companies

02:53.670 --> 02:55.740
are destroying the middle class?

02:55.740 --> 02:57.440
While the owners line their pockets

02:57.440 --> 02:59.800
with millions of dollars?

02:59.800 --> 03:01.100
- Uh, no.

03:01.100 --> 03:04.230
I just thought it was a
convenient way to get around town.

03:04.230 --> 03:05.480
- Yeah, for you!

03:05.480 --> 03:07.350
But it's not so convenient
if you're a driver,

03:07.350 --> 03:08.800
trying to make a living wage!

03:09.870 --> 03:12.660
You know what? Cancel the ride.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.690
I'll take you home.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.770
- No, thanks.

03:15.770 --> 03:17.120
- Of course.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.980
These fucking rideshares
are the blight of humanity.

03:19.980 --> 03:23.630
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you.

03:23.630 --> 03:24.960
- Hey!

03:24.960 --> 03:27.220
I just bought you a $20 drink.

03:27.220 --> 03:29.350
Why don't you sit down and
talk to me for five minutes?

03:29.350 --> 03:31.420
- Hey, jerk! Leave her alone!

03:31.420 --> 03:32.470
- You heard the lady.

03:33.340 --> 03:34.313
- Fuckin' bitch.

03:35.952 --> 03:38.052
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

03:40.352 --> 03:42.060
- Where did she find such a loser?

03:42.060 --> 03:43.007
- Such a dick.

03:45.990 --> 03:47.958
(glasses clink)

03:47.958 --> 03:49.350
(brakes squeak)

03:49.350 --> 03:54.350
(suspenseful music)
(muffled dance music)

04:10.070 --> 04:12.020
- Hey, man. Your picture was of a girl.

04:13.150 --> 04:15.040
Guess you thought by having
a picture of a hot chick,

04:15.040 --> 04:16.663
you'd get picked up faster, huh?

04:17.690 --> 04:19.140
Yeah, you're probably right,

04:19.140 --> 04:21.510
but I'm stilling giving you bad feedback.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.320
How do you like that, asshole?

04:23.320 --> 04:25.513
Fuckin' thumbs-down for your lying ass.

04:27.897 --> 04:30.897
(groans and chokes)

04:39.524 --> 04:42.691

(brakes squeak)

06:03.886 --> 06:06.553
(brakes squeak)

06:18.040 --> 06:19.160
- Okay.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.806
Thanks for the ride.

06:20.806 --> 06:21.955
Bye.

06:21.955 --> 06:24.705
(car door opens)

06:26.894 --> 06:29.644
(car door slams)

06:32.065 --> 06:34.482

(ominous tones)

07:14.368 --> 07:17.451
(footsteps approach)

07:18.540 --> 07:19.373
- Oh!

07:21.740 --> 07:24.703
- So does this outfit
radiate confident leader?

07:26.480 --> 07:29.223
- Well, if you have to ask, probably not.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.693
- I know, right?

07:32.780 --> 07:33.883
Too much gray.

07:41.432 --> 07:43.515
(knocks)

07:44.710 --> 07:46.203
- Yeah?

07:46.203 --> 07:47.440
- [Julia] Are you ready to go?

07:47.440 --> 07:48.420
- Can I go?

07:48.420 --> 07:52.240
- No one told you you could talk, slave!

07:52.240 --> 07:54.360
And no, you can't go.

07:54.360 --> 07:55.860
- Sorry, mistress.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.670
- Give me like five minutes.

07:57.670 --> 07:58.503
- [Julia] Okay.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.110
- Can you at least untie me?

08:06.612 --> 08:07.963
- In a few hours.

08:23.340 --> 08:26.220
So, what the fuck is this shindig tonight?

08:26.220 --> 08:27.390
- It's a pre-IPO party

08:27.390 --> 08:30.060
for my overachieving brother's company.

08:30.060 --> 08:31.570
- Oh, fuck.

08:31.570 --> 08:34.520
A night with stuffy white people.

08:34.520 --> 08:35.353
- Probably.

08:41.330 --> 08:45.060
- And you're dragging me along because?

08:45.060 --> 08:48.870
- Because my father invited
every rich person he knows,

08:48.870 --> 08:51.763
and we need an investor for
Rock n Ride, like yesterday.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.980
- So I gotta be nice, too?

08:54.980 --> 08:56.560
- We all do.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.450
We need to go there and
see if anyone's interested.

08:59.450 --> 09:02.130
Collect cards, names.

09:02.130 --> 09:04.493
Then I'll follow up with
a formal pitch next week.

09:05.994 --> 09:08.994
(suspenseful music)

09:17.901 --> 09:19.131
(car door slams)

09:19.131 --> 09:21.798
(mirror creaks)

09:30.923 --> 09:33.423
(eerie tones)

09:35.670 --> 09:38.023
- [Billy] Hey. Do you remember me?

09:39.280 --> 09:40.870
- I'm not sure.

09:40.870 --> 09:43.930
- Billy Smith. We went
to high school together.

09:43.930 --> 09:45.180
- Oh, yeah!

09:45.180 --> 09:47.320
- Remember? We were in Miss
Dahlia's biology class?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.820
We were lab partners?

09:48.820 --> 09:50.400
- Of course.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.870
What have you been up to?

09:51.870 --> 09:54.330
- [Billy] Uh, not much.

09:54.330 --> 09:56.740
- I heard you went into the army.

09:56.740 --> 09:59.620
- [Billy] Air Force.
God, it fuckin' sucked.

09:59.620 --> 10:01.080
One motherfucker fuckin' me over

10:01.080 --> 10:03.193
after another motherfucker fucks me over.

10:04.120 --> 10:05.730
First I was driving this cab for a while,

10:05.730 --> 10:08.360
I was picking people up
from the Beverly Hilton.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.260
I was just taking them to the same places.

10:10.260 --> 10:11.820
Over and over again.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.200
Back and forth.

10:13.200 --> 10:17.063
You know, my life was just
like going in circles.

10:17.063 --> 10:18.970
- I'm sorry to hear that.

10:18.970 --> 10:21.400
- [Billy] It's not your fault or anything.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.233
- Good.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.520
- [Billy] You know, I
just have to thank you,

10:26.520 --> 10:28.080
for starting this company.

10:28.080 --> 10:33.080
It really has turned
my life around so much.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.110
- Well, you're welcome.

10:35.110 --> 10:36.690
- [Billy] It's not like
I'm stalking or anything.

10:36.690 --> 10:38.800
I'm just following you on Twitter.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.300
- Good, 'cause I was a
little scared for a second.

10:53.540 --> 10:54.373
- Thanks.

11:01.398 --> 11:04.640
(mellow music)

11:04.640 --> 11:05.960
- [Reginald] Bad traffic?

11:05.960 --> 11:06.793
- Hey, Dad.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.100
- We'll call you over when we need you.

11:10.100 --> 11:10.933
- Okay.

11:10.933 --> 11:13.126
- Nice to see you, Mr. Altimari.

11:13.126 --> 11:13.959
- Stop.

11:17.817 --> 11:18.650
- Thank you.

11:18.650 --> 11:21.510
I want you to meet Todd
Woodbridge and James Flayhaven.

11:21.510 --> 11:24.263
Two heavy hitters with billions to invest.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.270
Be careful what you say to Flayhaven.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.700
He's invested heavily in
the tech taxi cab industry.

11:30.700 --> 11:32.500
- I'll give him the abridged pitch.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.573
- Okay. Come on.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.100
Todd. (chuckles)
- Hey. (chuckles)

11:42.100 --> 11:43.300
- James.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.360
I want you to meet my daughter, Julia.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.380
- How you doin'?

11:47.380 --> 11:48.820
- Very well, thank you.

11:48.820 --> 11:50.630
- I hear you might be
looking for some additional

11:50.630 --> 11:52.390
seed investors in your company.

11:52.390 --> 11:55.730
- Well, yes, we are, but
we're a little concerned

11:55.730 --> 11:58.540
about your investment in TaxiQuick.com?

11:58.540 --> 12:02.320
- You've already done some
due diligence. I'm impressed.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.480
- We're good that way.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.334
- I don't know which way
this thing is gonna break.

12:05.334 --> 12:08.260
Ridesharing might ultimately win out.

12:08.260 --> 12:11.430
But then again, the taxi
industry is adjusting

12:11.430 --> 12:13.063
and winning back a few markets.

12:14.550 --> 12:15.850
I just wanna make sure
I'm on the winning side,

12:15.850 --> 12:17.420
no matter what side wins.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.900
- Okay, but how can we be sure?

12:19.900 --> 12:21.480
- Take a meeting with me.

12:21.480 --> 12:24.583
I'll sign any NDA you want
and bring my checkbook.

12:25.550 --> 12:27.950
I'm prepared to give you
a full round of funding.

12:27.950 --> 12:31.060
- Well, that's a very
generous offer, James.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.420
Isn't it, Julia?

12:32.420 --> 12:34.150
- Almost too good to be true.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.160
- [James] I'll have my
assistant ring you tomorrow,

12:36.160 --> 12:37.290
to set something up.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.990
- That'd be great.

12:38.990 --> 12:40.930
The rideshare industry is expected to grow

12:40.930 --> 12:43.030
over 400 million in the next-

12:43.030 --> 12:45.680
- There's no need for your pitch.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.630
I understand the market.

12:47.630 --> 12:49.410
I wanna get to know you better.

12:49.410 --> 12:52.250
I invest in people, not companies.

12:52.250 --> 12:55.930
- And this is our CTO, Lorraine Barbour.

12:55.930 --> 12:57.570
- Hello.

12:57.570 --> 13:01.260
- And this is our art director.

13:01.260 --> 13:03.561
Naomi McGuinea!

13:03.561 --> 13:05.950
- What up, peeps?
(Reginald laughs)

13:05.950 --> 13:07.122
- Isn't she delightful?

13:07.122 --> 13:11.002
(Naomi laughs dramatically)

13:11.002 --> 13:13.540
(mellow music)
(footsteps approach)

13:13.540 --> 13:14.633
- Julia.

13:18.050 --> 13:20.480
- So, I've got one meeting set up.

13:20.480 --> 13:21.313
How you doin'?

13:21.313 --> 13:23.441
- Well, we're gettin' a lot of interest.

13:23.441 --> 13:26.503
- Of course you are. You've
built a fantastic company.

13:27.860 --> 13:28.693
- Are you ready?

13:30.841 --> 13:32.420
- (chuckles) I guess.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.820
- Oh, come on.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.950
Dad's been grooming you for
this IPO since you were three.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.257
- Yeah. I think he's more
interested in it than I am.

13:40.257 --> 13:42.590
- What're you doing? Get up!

13:44.010 --> 13:45.550
- Uh, he just gave me a dirty look.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.740
Well, gotta get back to schmoozing.

13:47.740 --> 13:48.573
Ciao.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.133
There we go.

13:57.150 --> 13:57.983
- Waiter.

13:58.870 --> 14:00.600
No more for him.

14:00.600 --> 14:01.843
- [Waiter] Of course, ma'am.

14:04.690 --> 14:07.320
- Why don't you just go
work for your brother?

14:07.320 --> 14:11.170
Get in now and you'll make
millions in a few months

14:11.170 --> 14:13.570
when they get their IPO.

14:13.570 --> 14:17.520
- My company is going to
do very well, thank you!

14:17.520 --> 14:20.030
- Of course. I didn't mean it wasn't.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.740
It's just...

14:21.740 --> 14:23.113
His is a sure thing.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.530
- I didn't empty my Rolodex on this party

14:26.530 --> 14:28.500
so you could talk to each other.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.470
Go! Mingle!

14:30.470 --> 14:32.443
Meet another investor!

14:33.660 --> 14:34.843
- Yes, Dad.

14:36.989 --> 14:39.906
(footsteps recede)

14:40.897 --> 14:44.814
(muffled chatter and laughter)

14:46.658 --> 14:48.370
- Oh, hey, Julia.

14:48.370 --> 14:51.453
You have time for a little due diligence?

14:52.320 --> 14:54.540
- Sure. What would you like to know?

14:54.540 --> 14:55.600
- Are you married?

14:55.600 --> 14:57.050
- No.
- Boyfriend?

14:57.050 --> 15:00.013
- I'm a little too busy for
a serious relationship now.

15:00.013 --> 15:04.150
- So, you're open for
a casual relationship?

15:04.150 --> 15:06.200
- No, I don't have time for that, either.

15:07.840 --> 15:08.673
- How old were you when you had

15:08.673 --> 15:10.580
your first sexual experience?

15:10.580 --> 15:11.680
- That's relevant, how?

15:11.680 --> 15:13.660
- [James] I'm just trying
to get to know you better.

15:13.660 --> 15:16.080
- Well, I'm not gonna answer that.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.300
Any more questions?

15:17.300 --> 15:20.540
- Clean shaven, landing
strip, or full-on bush?

15:20.540 --> 15:23.760
- Really? That's the
question you wanna ask me?

15:23.760 --> 15:26.530
Not where did I grow up or
where did I go to college,

15:26.530 --> 15:28.950
or what challenges I
think the business faces?

15:28.950 --> 15:31.520
- You grew up in Upstate New
York, you went to Stanford.

15:31.520 --> 15:35.400
Right now, a lack of capital
is your biggest challenge.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.978
A problem I can help you with.

15:38.978 --> 15:42.060
- Oh, congratulations. You've
done your due diligence.

15:42.060 --> 15:45.337
- Some of it, but I'd
like to do a little more.

15:45.337 --> 15:46.637
- (scoffs) No, thank you.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.080
- Do you what difference
between successful people

15:50.080 --> 15:52.530
and unsuccessful people is?

15:52.530 --> 15:54.370
Successful people are willing to do

15:54.370 --> 15:56.513
what unsuccessful people simply aren't.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.040
Are you working to work
with a real son of a bitch

15:59.040 --> 16:00.090
to save your company?

16:01.127 --> 16:02.570
(thud)
(groans)

16:02.570 --> 16:03.433
- Julia!

16:04.639 --> 16:07.399
I'm so sorry. I don't
know what got into her!

16:07.399 --> 16:09.460
(James groans)

16:09.460 --> 16:12.873
- Luckily I cryogenically froze
several billion of my sperm.

16:16.170 --> 16:19.190
- [Reginald] What the hell happened there?

16:19.190 --> 16:22.130
- That creep sexually harassed me.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.610
- He was probably just trying

16:23.610 --> 16:25.780
to get to know you a little bit.

16:25.780 --> 16:29.348
- He asked me how I shave my pubic hair.

16:29.348 --> 16:32.598
(brooding piano music)

16:42.954 --> 16:45.787
(children giggle)

16:52.994 --> 16:53.827
- Julia!

16:57.346 --> 16:58.179
Hey.

17:33.566 --> 17:36.316
(car door opens)

17:42.164 --> 17:44.914
(car door slams)

17:56.026 --> 17:56.859
You okay?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.770
- We shouldn't have gone.

18:01.770 --> 18:03.263
It was my brother's party.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.933
And just one more thing for
my dad to criticize about me.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.673
- Dad's wrong on this, okay?

18:12.673 --> 18:16.180
That guy was a creep and
you did the right thing.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.013
- I know.

18:18.484 --> 18:20.620
I just wish they'd shut the
fuck up about my perfect

18:20.620 --> 18:23.920
little brother and how fantastic
his company is, you know?

18:23.920 --> 18:25.360
- Yeah.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.804
He sucks.

18:26.804 --> 18:29.387
(both chuckle)

18:44.631 --> 18:47.298
(switch clicks)

18:50.109 --> 18:53.322
(keyboard clacks)

18:53.322 --> 18:55.322
(sighs)

18:56.930 --> 18:59.930
(suspenseful music)

19:02.002 --> 19:02.835
Um...

19:02.835 --> 19:04.040
Julia?

19:04.040 --> 19:06.240
I think you better come
take a look at this.

19:07.410 --> 19:10.243
(keyboard clacks)

19:12.920 --> 19:14.283
- What the fuck?

19:15.471 --> 19:17.210
- That can't be real.

19:17.210 --> 19:19.370
- Well, we're gonna find out.

19:19.370 --> 19:20.981
What is her number?

19:20.981 --> 19:22.930
(keyboard clacks)

19:22.930 --> 19:23.847
- Um, here.

19:26.549 --> 19:28.757
(phone dials)

19:28.757 --> 19:30.708
(phone rings)

19:30.708 --> 19:31.940
- [Machine] The customer
you are trying to reach-

19:31.940 --> 19:33.249
- Voicemail.

19:33.249 --> 19:35.393
- [Machine] Please leave
a message at the tone.

19:36.267 --> 19:37.490
- Hi, Samantha.

19:37.490 --> 19:40.500
This is Julia Altimari
calling from Rock n Ride.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.357
We just saw your feedback from last night

19:42.357 --> 19:44.480
and we wanna talk to you about it.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.890
With allegations this serious,

19:45.890 --> 19:47.840
we're gonna have to involve the police.

19:48.690 --> 19:50.130
Call me back as soon as possible.

19:50.130 --> 19:51.550
I'm calling you from my cellphone.

19:51.550 --> 19:54.769
Please call me back on
this number. Thanks.

19:54.769 --> 19:56.280
(phone bleeps)

19:56.280 --> 19:58.169
Where was she dropped off?

19:58.169 --> 20:00.810
(keyboard clacks)

20:00.810 --> 20:03.740
- Uh, Woodland Hills.
About 10 miles from here.

20:03.740 --> 20:05.440
- Are we gonna call the police?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.390
- We have to make sure it's not a joke.

20:08.670 --> 20:11.090
Pull the driver so he
can't pick up anyone else.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.300
- Got it.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.430
(keyboard clacks)

20:15.430 --> 20:16.930
- [Julia] I'm goin' over there.

20:16.930 --> 20:18.273
- You're doing what?

20:24.209 --> 20:27.876
(brooding orchestral music)

20:31.208 --> 20:33.875
(brakes squeak)

20:45.768 --> 20:46.909
(knocks)

20:46.909 --> 20:48.550
(door creaks)

20:48.550 --> 20:49.533
- Samantha?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.603
Are you here?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.583
Call 911.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.853
Call 911!

20:57.853 --> 20:59.480
(phone bleeps)

20:59.480 --> 21:00.653
Samantha!

21:01.640 --> 21:05.220
It's Julia Altimari from
Rock n Ride. Are you here?

21:05.220 --> 21:07.970
- I think we should wait for the police!

21:07.970 --> 21:09.270
- She might need our help!

21:23.520 --> 21:25.280
- I think we should get
the hell out of here

21:25.280 --> 21:27.170
and wait for the police!

21:27.170 --> 21:29.337
- [Julia] Samantha! Are you here?

21:29.337 --> 21:31.837
(Naomi sighs)

21:44.502 --> 21:45.931
(Naomi screams)

21:45.931 --> 21:47.014
- Oh, my god.

21:51.030 --> 21:53.530
(Naomi gasps)

21:56.850 --> 21:59.267
(door slams)

22:23.860 --> 22:24.693
- Well?

22:25.650 --> 22:28.550
- Well, she didn't post the
feedback when she was tied up.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.170
- Thank you, Captain Obvious.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.113
- Obviously the killer
wanted her to be found.

22:37.750 --> 22:38.773
- But why?

22:39.961 --> 22:43.461
- Well, that's what we have to figure out.

22:56.268 --> 22:58.188
(car door slams)

22:58.188 --> 23:00.938
(crickets chirp)

23:02.382 --> 23:04.422
(doorbell rings)

23:04.422 --> 23:05.780
(Moyer sighs)

23:05.780 --> 23:07.230
- Man.

23:07.230 --> 23:10.240
Wonder how a small startup
can afford a place like this.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.410
- Actually, it's my house.

23:12.410 --> 23:14.710
I'm letting Rock n Ride use
it as their headquarters

23:14.710 --> 23:16.620
until they can move into a proper office.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.880
- And you are?
- I'm Reginald Altimari.

23:18.880 --> 23:20.990
I'm chairman of the board.
- It's a pleasure.

23:20.990 --> 23:22.670
- And you're Julia
Altimari's father, right?

23:22.670 --> 23:23.750
- That's right.

23:23.750 --> 23:24.890
- Figures.

23:24.890 --> 23:27.640
No way a bunch of coeds could
afford a place like this.

23:32.513 --> 23:34.130
- You bringin' sexy back?

23:34.130 --> 23:35.313
- Uh, no?

23:36.530 --> 23:37.453
Is Julia here?

23:50.100 --> 23:52.380
- We found the driver in a dumpster,

23:52.380 --> 23:53.873
about a mile from the club.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.220
- What were you able to
find out about the driver?

23:57.220 --> 23:59.020
- Well, when I-
- Hold on a second.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.780
Should our lawyers be here?

24:01.780 --> 24:03.130
- I don't think that's necessary.

24:03.130 --> 24:06.270
- Look, something like this,
it could sink our business.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.260
So, it has to be handled carefully.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.470
I don't want this
leaking out to the media.

24:11.470 --> 24:14.300
- We're not in the habit
of leaking information.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.970
- Yeah, right. Cops
never leak information.

24:16.970 --> 24:20.275
- Two people are dead. They're gone.

24:20.275 --> 24:23.490
They're not coming back and
your app was used to kill 'em.

24:23.490 --> 24:25.070
- You don't know that!

24:25.070 --> 24:27.140
- We all want the same thing, pal.

24:27.140 --> 24:28.060
- Do we?

24:28.060 --> 24:29.823
- Look, stop. Everyone.

24:30.710 --> 24:33.040
These two people deserve
all of our best efforts

24:33.040 --> 24:33.963
to get this guy.

24:34.860 --> 24:37.110
We're happy to share
any information we have.

24:38.190 --> 24:39.320
- Thank you.

24:39.320 --> 24:41.810
- Now what do you have on the driver?

24:41.810 --> 24:44.220
- Uh, nothing unusual.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.930
He's done over 300 rides

24:45.930 --> 24:48.670
and his feedback was all pretty good.

24:48.670 --> 24:50.400
He's picked up 14 people from that club

24:50.400 --> 24:52.080
in the last two weeks.

24:52.080 --> 24:54.080
- Well, you guys know your
systems better than anybody else

24:54.080 --> 24:57.210
so why don't you keep
thinking about the problem

24:57.210 --> 24:59.700
and see if you can come at
it from a different angle?

24:59.700 --> 25:01.347
- And no matter how trivial
you think it might be,

25:01.347 --> 25:05.213
you let us know immediately
if you know anything, okay?

25:06.190 --> 25:07.023
- Of course.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.970
- This thing could not
only sink our business,

25:17.970 --> 25:20.163
it could sink the entire industry.

25:21.380 --> 25:22.870
You've gotta do everything you can

25:22.870 --> 25:26.280
to help the police catch
this son of a bitch quickly.

25:26.280 --> 25:29.493
But also, keep it as private as possible.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.240
- We will.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.200
- If it's just one murder,

25:34.200 --> 25:36.943
we could position it as an anomaly, but,

25:38.260 --> 25:41.670
if it's a string murders,
there's no way to spin that.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.820
People would be too scared to
take even one of our rides.

25:44.820 --> 25:46.353
- Believe me, I know.

25:48.090 --> 25:50.100
- I'm giving you just enough money

25:50.100 --> 25:52.040
to get through another month.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.580
- And then what?

25:53.580 --> 25:56.240
- I'm gonna need you to
call James Flayhaven back

25:56.240 --> 25:58.500
and apologize.

25:58.500 --> 26:01.510
- Apologize for being sexually harassed?

26:01.510 --> 26:04.130
- He's the only person that
showed even a remote interest

26:04.130 --> 26:06.180
in investing in your company!

26:06.180 --> 26:07.730
- Well, I don't wanna call him!

26:11.030 --> 26:12.023
- Julia!

26:13.520 --> 26:17.400
I invested in your company,
because you told me

26:17.400 --> 26:20.350
that you would do whatever it
takes to make this thing work.

26:20.350 --> 26:24.760
Well, now is the time
to do whatever it takes.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.840
- Well, I think it's time
to pivot the company.

26:27.840 --> 26:29.423
- Pivot? To what?

26:30.290 --> 26:33.290
- What about a rideshare for women only?

26:33.290 --> 26:35.370
Women passengers, women drivers.

26:35.370 --> 26:36.670
No men.

26:36.670 --> 26:39.560
- How many of our rides are only women?

26:39.560 --> 26:41.454
- About 10%.

26:41.454 --> 26:45.113
- So, you literally wanna
cut our sales by 90%?

26:46.280 --> 26:49.190
Come on. You're smarter than this.

26:49.190 --> 26:51.180
- Women would feel safe.

26:51.180 --> 26:52.790
We could cut into the bigger companies'

26:52.790 --> 26:54.810
market shares and stand out!

26:54.810 --> 26:58.150
- Nobody is going to invest in that!

26:58.150 --> 27:01.070
Look, your business needs a market cap

27:01.070 --> 27:05.380
of at least a billion
dollars, not 10% of a billion.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.380
- Well, would you consider-

27:06.380 --> 27:09.783
- I'm going to need you to call James!

27:10.730 --> 27:12.563
- I'm not going to call him!

27:14.190 --> 27:15.800
- Fine.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.120
Okay!

27:17.120 --> 27:18.880
You're the CEO.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.250
But you're gonna have to go back in there

27:21.250 --> 27:25.640
and fire your friends, because
if you are not committed

27:25.640 --> 27:27.900
to making this company a success,

27:27.900 --> 27:31.913
then I am not committed to
throwing any more money at it.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.620
- Well, I am going to
explore other options,

27:36.620 --> 27:40.193
and if nothing pans out in
a month, then I'll call him!

27:43.820 --> 27:46.963
- Well, I'm glad to see you
got your head screwed back on!

28:02.670 --> 28:03.790
(phone clicks)

28:03.790 --> 28:05.460
- [Driver] Say, are you
one of the head honchos

28:05.460 --> 28:06.483
at Rock n Ride?

28:07.600 --> 28:10.070
- I'm on the board, if
that's what you mean.

28:10.070 --> 28:12.460
- That's exactly what I mean.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.940
You know, I think it's
fantastic what you're doing.

28:14.940 --> 28:18.390
Creating millions of jobs
with scheduling flexibility.

28:18.390 --> 28:21.490
All while bringing the
consumer an amazing product.

28:21.490 --> 28:24.460
- Maybe we should hire
you as our pitch man.

28:24.460 --> 28:26.213
- Well, I'm absolutely available.

28:40.782 --> 28:43.782
(suspenseful music)

28:47.360 --> 28:52.360
(doorbell rings)
(keyboards clack)

28:55.586 --> 28:58.336
(doorbell rings)

29:02.670 --> 29:04.253
- I'll get it.

29:04.253 --> 29:07.253
(clears her throat)

29:12.272 --> 29:17.272
Hello?

29:18.123 --> 29:18.956
Hello?

29:20.323 --> 29:21.656
Is anyone there?

29:29.156 --> 29:31.573
(door slams)

29:34.216 --> 29:37.049
(keyboards clack)

29:38.190 --> 29:39.540
- Who was it?

29:39.540 --> 29:40.593
- Nobody was there.

29:43.576 --> 29:45.610
(muffled rustling)

29:45.610 --> 29:47.150
- Oh, shit.

29:47.150 --> 29:49.053
There's someone in the backyard.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.100
- What're you doing?

29:57.449 --> 30:00.282
(machete scrapes)

30:04.340 --> 30:05.430
- Wow.

30:05.430 --> 30:06.790
Where did you get that?

30:06.790 --> 30:11.290
- I keep it under the table,
in case of emergencies.

30:11.290 --> 30:12.123
- Good thinking.

30:13.895 --> 30:14.728
- What?

30:25.853 --> 30:28.230
(bottles and cans clink)

30:28.230 --> 30:29.890
- Hey, motherfucker!

30:29.890 --> 30:33.633
I got a big-ass machete
here, with your name on it!

30:38.645 --> 30:41.228
(music swells)

30:42.153 --> 30:44.903
(screams)
- Whoa!

30:46.023 --> 30:47.870
- (sighs) Fuck.

30:47.870 --> 30:49.423
Really?
- Do you know him?

30:50.410 --> 30:52.290
- Unfortunately.

30:52.290 --> 30:55.670
What the hell are you doing
creeping around our backyard?

30:55.670 --> 30:58.080
- I rang the bell. No one answered.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.460
- Hey, fuck wad!

30:59.460 --> 31:03.483
You know you're allowed to
kill someone who trespasses.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.943
- Maybe in 1876 Texas, but
not in modern-day California.

31:10.550 --> 31:12.210
- What do you want?

31:12.210 --> 31:15.310
- I'm writing a fair and balanced
article about Rock n Ride.

31:15.310 --> 31:17.390
- Oh, of course you are.

31:17.390 --> 31:20.010
- I was hoping I can get
an interview with you.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.423
- Absolutely not.

31:24.380 --> 31:28.040
- [Rohan] I got a tip one of
your drivers killed a girl.

31:28.040 --> 31:29.040
- Who told you that?

31:30.010 --> 31:32.463
- I can't reveal my source, but it's true.

31:33.410 --> 31:34.400
Isn't it?

31:34.400 --> 31:36.590
- Look, don't fuck with me again.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.690
This company has legs and I
don't want you ruining it!

31:39.690 --> 31:41.350
- Who the fuck are you?

31:41.350 --> 31:44.680
- I'm Rohan Patel, publisher
of ShittyStartup.com.

31:44.680 --> 31:45.710
Nice to meet you.

31:45.710 --> 31:48.713
- He also single handedly
fucked Julia's other startups.

31:50.130 --> 31:52.480
- Yeah, we had a thing in college.

31:52.480 --> 31:53.530
I thought it was so sweet

31:53.530 --> 31:56.400
that he was putting his
number into my contacts,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.350
but then when I called the next day,

31:58.350 --> 32:00.120
it was an abortion clinic.

32:00.120 --> 32:01.780
- What a dick!

32:01.780 --> 32:03.480
- Hey, that wasn't my best moment.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.250
Did I ever apologize for that?

32:06.250 --> 32:07.083
- No.

32:10.950 --> 32:13.400
- Hey, if you change your
mind about the interview,

32:13.400 --> 32:14.700
you know where to find me.

32:15.670 --> 32:18.253
(Naomi hisses)

32:21.030 --> 32:24.030
(suspenseful music)

32:43.760 --> 32:46.200
- Thank you for sitting in the front seat.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.060
It's about damn time
someone sat up here with me.

32:49.060 --> 32:53.093
Most of the time, people just
hop in the back and ignore me.

33:03.970 --> 33:05.520
You're sure this is a shortcut?

33:06.422 --> 33:09.422
(groans and chokes)

33:22.529 --> 33:25.362
(car door closes)

33:40.371 --> 33:42.709
(distant siren wails)

33:42.709 --> 33:45.042
(lid slams)

33:47.640 --> 33:49.160
- Have we really done everything we can

33:49.160 --> 33:50.613
to protect our customers?

33:52.627 --> 33:55.473
- I mean, we could always do more.

33:57.220 --> 34:00.033
- You know, my dad kept
telling us to grow quickly,

34:00.960 --> 34:03.290
but maybe that was a mistake.

34:03.290 --> 34:04.883
Maybe we should grow slow.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.033
Maybe our protocol isn't good enough.

34:10.030 --> 34:12.003
- I mean, what could we have done?

34:12.970 --> 34:17.790
Some psychopath picks up a
driver, kills them, gets a rider.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.390
- Let's try to solve this thing.

34:20.380 --> 34:21.280
- [Lorraine] Okay.

34:22.810 --> 34:25.503
- How do you think Rohan
found out about the murder?

34:27.656 --> 34:30.253
- I don't know.

34:30.253 --> 34:33.600
- I don't think the police
told him after the talk we had.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.630
- Me neither.

34:34.630 --> 34:36.060
- And none of us would have told him.

34:36.060 --> 34:37.810
- Absolutely not.

34:37.810 --> 34:41.070
- So the only person that
could know about the murder

34:41.070 --> 34:42.403
would be the killer.

34:44.070 --> 34:44.903
- Yeah.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.713
But why would he tell Rohan?

34:48.780 --> 34:50.863
- To get press for the murder.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.650
- Okay.

34:53.650 --> 34:54.483
Why?

34:55.690 --> 34:57.240
- Maybe to destroy our company.

34:58.190 --> 34:59.663
- Again, why?

35:00.800 --> 35:04.320
- The killer must have
visited the club, right?

35:04.320 --> 35:05.370
- Maybe.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.170
- To get familiar with the location.

35:08.020 --> 35:09.900
To plan the murder.

35:09.900 --> 35:10.830
- Okay.

35:10.830 --> 35:12.940
- Maybe he just made that call

35:12.940 --> 35:14.790
to see how everything would play out.

35:17.290 --> 35:20.965
How many people have been picked
up from that club recently?

35:20.965 --> 35:23.900
(keyboard clacks)

35:23.900 --> 35:26.973
- At least half a dozen, almost every day.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.820
- Holy fuck!

35:29.820 --> 35:31.470
- What?

35:31.470 --> 35:33.060
- Print that out for me.

35:33.060 --> 35:34.103
- What? What is it?

35:35.965 --> 35:37.100
(keyboard clacks)

35:37.100 --> 35:39.600
- Yeah, Dad. Yeah.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.550
No, I've got some leads for the police.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.300
No, no, no. No, I'm walking
it over there myself.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.173
Okay, bye.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.000
- Do you really think it's a good idea

35:49.000 --> 35:50.593
to take one of our own rides?

35:51.430 --> 35:53.020
- I'm the fucking CEO.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.320
If I'm not gonna use my service,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.920
how do I expect anybody else to?

35:56.950 --> 35:59.540
- You're not creeped out at all?

35:59.540 --> 36:01.830
- Of course not, even if there
is a serial killer out there,

36:01.830 --> 36:05.603
using our app, what are the
odds of him picking us up?

36:06.525 --> 36:08.843
(car approaches)
(suspenseful music)

36:08.843 --> 36:11.510
(brakes squeak)

36:28.169 --> 36:31.002
(car door closes)

37:42.985 --> 37:45.818
(car door closes)

37:47.920 --> 37:49.203
- So, what you got?

37:50.830 --> 37:53.180
- These three men were picked
up by one of our drivers,

37:53.180 --> 37:56.540
from the same club, numerous
times, in the last month.

37:56.540 --> 37:57.870
- Really?

37:57.870 --> 38:00.760
- I don't recognize him, but
he's been picked up nine times

38:00.760 --> 38:01.733
in the last month.

38:02.810 --> 38:05.730
- We'll talk to this guy, ASAP.

38:05.730 --> 38:07.090
- I went to high school with him.

38:07.090 --> 38:09.190
He took us to a party on Friday.

38:09.190 --> 38:10.930
- That's one hell of a coincidence.

38:10.930 --> 38:11.900
- Yeah and I caught this one

38:11.900 --> 38:14.340
creepin' around in my backyard tonight.

38:14.340 --> 38:16.113
- Rohan Patel?

38:16.960 --> 38:18.410
What did he want?

38:18.410 --> 38:20.750
- He said he couldn't reveal his source,

38:20.750 --> 38:22.400
but he knew about the murder.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.617
- Why do you have pictures
of the two of them,

38:23.617 --> 38:26.080
but not this Rohan Patel guy?

38:26.080 --> 38:28.290
- Well, we only have
pictures of our drivers

38:28.290 --> 38:29.790
and the first two have driven for us,

38:29.790 --> 38:31.763
whereas Rohan's only been a passenger.

38:33.470 --> 38:35.260
- It's really good work.

38:35.260 --> 38:36.823
We will follow up on this.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.760
- Thanks for a great date night.

38:40.760 --> 38:41.593
- You're welcome.

38:41.593 --> 38:43.439
It's not over yet.

38:43.439 --> 38:46.900
- Mm, I like the sound of that. (chuckles)

38:49.561 --> 38:51.978
(horn honks)

38:54.847 --> 38:57.847
(suspenseful music)

39:03.758 --> 39:06.591
(car door closes)

39:17.350 --> 39:20.247
Stop! He's gonna kick us out.

39:20.247 --> 39:21.893
- It'll be the highlight of his week.

39:23.023 --> 39:25.440
(hand slaps)

39:33.440 --> 39:35.100
Yo, driver.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.818
Aren't you supposed to give
us some free water and gum?

39:37.818 --> 39:40.327
(wheels screech)

39:40.327 --> 39:42.366
- [Female Passenger] Help! Help!

39:42.366 --> 39:44.509
(male passenger chokes)

39:44.509 --> 39:45.342
(fence rattles)

39:45.342 --> 39:48.558
(car door slams)

39:48.558 --> 39:51.475
(gasps and chokes)

40:04.292 --> 40:06.841
(body thumps)

40:06.841 --> 40:09.591
(crickets chirp)

40:11.831 --> 40:15.331
(somber orchestral music)

40:29.342 --> 40:31.759
(Julia sobs)

40:46.880 --> 40:49.380
- Yeah, I go to that club all the time.

40:49.380 --> 40:50.580
They let babes in for free,

40:50.580 --> 40:52.330
so it's always packed with hotties.

40:53.190 --> 40:54.223
- You recognize her?

40:58.000 --> 40:59.920
- Nope. Never seen her.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.550
- Really?

41:01.550 --> 41:02.500
Take a closer look.

41:05.644 --> 41:08.430
(ominous music)

41:08.430 --> 41:09.830
- Oh, yeah.

41:09.830 --> 41:11.250
Her.

41:11.250 --> 41:12.710
I met her Saturday.

41:12.710 --> 41:13.763
- You mean Sunday.

41:15.040 --> 41:15.930
- Could've been.

41:15.930 --> 41:17.840
- This picture was taken on Sunday.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.710
- Whatever. I talked to
her for like five seconds.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.370
She was a bitch.

41:22.370 --> 41:24.370
- What did you do after she left?

41:24.370 --> 41:26.164
- I went home, I went to bed.

41:26.164 --> 41:27.876
- Can anyone verify that?

41:27.876 --> 41:30.260
(Chip laughs)

41:30.260 --> 41:31.623
- If this girl's missing,

41:32.650 --> 41:34.450
I don't have anything to do with it.

41:35.570 --> 41:37.870
- Can anybody corroborate your whereabouts

41:37.870 --> 41:40.260
on Sunday night around midnight?

41:40.260 --> 41:41.360
- I don't know. Maybe.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.303
I went home, I went to bed. I live alone.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.670
I didn't talk to anybody.
Maybe somebody saw me.

41:58.772 --> 42:01.522
(car approaches)

42:02.582 --> 42:05.249
(brakes squeak)

42:20.770 --> 42:23.853
(passenger chuckles)

42:26.120 --> 42:28.453
- [Rohan] So, she's the
girl who got killed.

42:29.460 --> 42:32.070
- We're the ones asking
the questions, pal.

42:32.070 --> 42:33.570
- Who told you about the girl?

42:35.140 --> 42:37.230
- I wouldn't tell you the
source, even if I knew.

42:37.230 --> 42:38.223
But I don't.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.640
I got an anonymous call saying

42:41.640 --> 42:43.640
that a Rock n Ride driver killed a girl.

42:44.900 --> 42:47.060
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

42:47.060 --> 42:49.590
- Why were you at the
club on Sunday night?

42:49.590 --> 42:52.090
- So she was there, wasn't she?

42:52.090 --> 42:55.440
- We're the ones asking
the questions, asshole.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.370
- Why were you at the club?

42:57.370 --> 42:58.680
- Same tipster called me.

42:58.680 --> 43:01.593
He said he was gonna be
there, but he never showed up.

43:10.306 --> 43:12.723
(horn honks)

43:19.712 --> 43:22.456
- Hey. How are you this evening?

43:22.456 --> 43:25.289
(car door closes)

43:29.900 --> 43:30.850
- I don't know her.

43:31.715 --> 43:33.670
- Have you ever seen her before?

43:33.670 --> 43:35.000
- No.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.150
- Why were you at the
club on Sunday night?

43:38.590 --> 43:40.080
- I was just hanging out.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.163
- You go there often?

43:42.060 --> 43:43.653
- I've been there a few times.

43:45.600 --> 43:48.853
- We need you to hang in
town until further notice.

43:51.110 --> 43:51.943
- Okay.

43:59.153 --> 44:00.383
(phone camera clicks)

44:00.383 --> 44:03.466
(footsteps approach)

44:06.892 --> 44:07.730
(phone camera clicks)

44:07.730 --> 44:09.090
- Hey! What up, slut?

44:09.090 --> 44:11.970
- What the fuck are you doing out here?

44:11.970 --> 44:14.150
- I heard there was
another murder last night.

44:14.150 --> 44:15.720
- [Julia] There was not.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.440
- My source tells me there was.

44:18.440 --> 44:19.990
- Do you realize that the only person

44:19.990 --> 44:23.120
that could tell you that
information is the murderer?

44:23.120 --> 44:24.253
- Or the police.

44:25.200 --> 44:27.010
- They have no need to feed information

44:27.010 --> 44:29.320
to a shitty tech blogger.

44:29.320 --> 44:30.450
- Maybe.

44:30.450 --> 44:32.010
Maybe not.

44:32.010 --> 44:34.550
- Have you considered why this murderer

44:34.550 --> 44:36.720
wants to give you all this information?

44:36.720 --> 44:39.600
- Maybe because he's a
fan of great journalism.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.763
- Oh, so your source is a man?

44:42.823 --> 44:44.303
- I didn't say that.

44:45.270 --> 44:48.130
- Well, he knew we had history,

44:48.130 --> 44:50.570
and he knew you'd take the bait.

44:50.570 --> 44:52.450
He wants you to write this story

44:52.450 --> 44:55.060
and you are being played like a fiddle.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.490
And if the police don't catch this guy,

44:57.490 --> 45:01.580
sooner or later, he'll have
no use for you, either.

45:01.580 --> 45:04.233
You will be a loose end
that needs to be tied up.

45:05.260 --> 45:07.070
- You're not going to scare me.

45:07.070 --> 45:09.873
- If you're not scared,
then you're the murderer.

45:21.984 --> 45:24.984
(suspenseful music)

45:45.142 --> 45:47.420
(keyboard clacks)

45:47.420 --> 45:49.130
There's been more murders.

45:49.130 --> 45:50.690
- What?

45:50.690 --> 45:53.770
- A driver was killed and
then the killer picked up

45:53.770 --> 45:56.883
three rides and killed them all.

45:57.840 --> 46:00.100
- Let me see what I can find out.

46:00.100 --> 46:02.490
What was the name of the driver?

46:02.490 --> 46:03.653
- Michelle Lindholm.

46:05.500 --> 46:06.763
I gotta talk to my dad.

46:11.562 --> 46:12.562
- (sighs) Okay.

46:12.562 --> 46:14.140
- What're you looking for?

46:14.140 --> 46:16.470
- I'm gonna cross-reference
the first list of suspects

46:16.470 --> 46:18.110
from the club with anyone
who's gotten a ride

46:18.110 --> 46:19.710
from one of these new locations.

46:21.020 --> 46:21.853
- Smart.

46:23.490 --> 46:25.640
- Oh, shit!
(suspenseful music)

46:25.640 --> 46:28.050
- That's the guy who drove us to the party

46:28.050 --> 46:29.060
the other day, right?

46:29.060 --> 46:30.230
- Yeah.

46:30.230 --> 46:31.063
Yeah.

46:31.063 --> 46:32.483
- Is he driving anyone now?

46:33.330 --> 46:34.970
- Yes.

46:34.970 --> 46:36.970
(gasps)

46:38.420 --> 46:39.863
Oh, my god. He's got Julia.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.690
- Hi, Julia.

46:43.690 --> 46:45.250
(machete scrapes)

46:45.250 --> 46:46.510
(phone clicks)

46:46.510 --> 46:49.860
- Billy. I am so glad to
see that you're my driver.

46:49.860 --> 46:52.940
- Why is that?
(phone chimes and vibrates)

46:52.940 --> 46:54.233
- It's a long story.

46:56.510 --> 47:00.083
Um, I forgot something.
I'll be right back, okay?

47:02.380 --> 47:04.020
- Yeah, that sometimes gets stuck.

47:04.020 --> 47:06.020
Wait, wait, wait. You're gonna break it.

47:07.671 --> 47:10.171
(tense music)

47:11.090 --> 47:12.911
(handle rattles)

47:12.911 --> 47:13.759
You have to-

47:13.759 --> 47:16.592
- Get away from her, motherfucker!

47:24.124 --> 47:27.074
(engine roars)

47:27.074 --> 47:29.741
(tires screech)

47:32.397 --> 47:34.230
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

47:35.287 --> 47:36.620
- What happened?

47:43.409 --> 47:46.659
(brooding piano music)

48:14.889 --> 48:16.972
- Check that out.
- Right.

48:40.770 --> 48:41.603
- Bingo.

48:54.668 --> 48:56.560
(door opens)

48:56.560 --> 48:57.393
- Ladies.

49:01.420 --> 49:02.823
We searched his apartment.

49:04.360 --> 49:07.453
We found the drivers
licenses of the victims.

49:09.180 --> 49:11.330
- But he didn't seem like the type.

49:11.330 --> 49:12.700
- No.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.260
They never do.

49:14.260 --> 49:16.003
But he fits the profile to a T.

49:17.050 --> 49:20.923
- He's a loner, high IQ
and socially awkward.

49:22.150 --> 49:24.060
He was dishonorably
discharged from the marines

49:24.060 --> 49:25.683
for allegedly raping a girl.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.193
Textbook sociopath.

49:29.360 --> 49:30.860
- Turn the app off.

49:30.860 --> 49:33.620
I don't want any more rides
until we figure this out.

49:33.620 --> 49:35.370
- It's probably a good idea.

49:35.370 --> 49:36.520
- I'll do it right now.

49:39.300 --> 49:42.170
- And ladies, we're gonna have
a police officer here 24/7

49:42.170 --> 49:44.310
to look after you until
this blows over, okay?

49:44.310 --> 49:45.143
- Thank you.

49:50.870 --> 49:52.010
- I miss you too, baby,

49:52.010 --> 49:54.875
but Mommy's gonna have to
tuck you in tonight, okay?

49:54.875 --> 49:56.105
(distant cracking)
And...

49:56.105 --> 49:57.860
(suspenseful music)

49:57.860 --> 49:59.483
I have to go. I'll call you back.

50:00.959 --> 50:02.819
(phone bleeps)

50:02.819 --> 50:05.486
(switch clicks)

50:26.162 --> 50:28.829
(switch clicks)

50:35.179 --> 50:37.679
(Julia gasps)

50:45.006 --> 50:47.506
(birds tweet)

50:51.670 --> 50:53.020
- [Erin] Would you like
to make a statement

50:53.020 --> 50:53.853
about the murders?

50:53.853 --> 50:55.800
- Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

50:55.800 --> 50:57.250
- Not at this time.

50:57.250 --> 50:59.000
- How many murders have there been?

51:02.059 --> 51:04.982
(door closes)

51:04.982 --> 51:07.120
(Julia sighs)

51:07.120 --> 51:09.290
- How did she know about the murders?

51:09.290 --> 51:12.120
- Rohan published the scoop this morning.

51:12.120 --> 51:15.273
- God damn it. My dad
is gonna be so pissed.

51:16.361 --> 51:17.651
- Yeah.

51:17.651 --> 51:20.151
(phone dials)

51:34.150 --> 51:36.750
- Bring the reporters up to the courtyard.

51:36.750 --> 51:37.583
- Yes, sir.

51:42.630 --> 51:46.020
- You're gonna have to go out
there and make a statement.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.173
- What am I gonna say?

51:49.310 --> 51:51.123
- You make yourself the victim.

51:52.030 --> 51:54.810
You tell them that this guy
harassed you in high school

51:54.810 --> 51:57.200
and that he's a deranged lunatic.

51:57.200 --> 52:00.090
And you make it clear that

52:00.090 --> 52:02.903
we're not liable for any of this.

52:04.550 --> 52:06.560
Julia? I'm talking to you.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.590
- I don't even know if Billy did it.

52:08.590 --> 52:12.760
- Well, the police think he's
guilty and so do we, okay?

52:12.760 --> 52:14.710
- Well, I don't know!

52:14.710 --> 52:16.230
- Listen to me.
(tense music)

52:16.230 --> 52:19.190
The only chance that this
app stands of surviving

52:19.190 --> 52:24.120
is if you make it clear that
this lunatic was an aberration.

52:24.120 --> 52:24.953
And...

52:25.800 --> 52:27.690
This whole thing,

52:27.690 --> 52:31.513
it has nothing to do with any
of our policies or procedures.

52:32.830 --> 52:33.663
Julia.

52:34.630 --> 52:38.460
You have a fiduciary
duty to your investors.

52:38.460 --> 52:40.893
Do not get all emotional on me.

52:50.570 --> 52:52.860
- As you know, there
have been several murders

52:52.860 --> 52:54.620
in the past few days.

52:54.620 --> 52:56.020
The police have a suspect

52:56.020 --> 52:58.730
and are confident that
they'll catch him very soon.

52:58.730 --> 53:00.960
This is someone that I
went to high school with,

53:00.960 --> 53:03.940
who apparently was obsessed with me.

53:03.940 --> 53:07.763
He was a deranged lunatic with
some sort of mental illness.

53:08.920 --> 53:11.590
We're working with the police
and doing everything we can

53:11.590 --> 53:14.270
to help catch him, but
as an added precaution,

53:14.270 --> 53:18.470
we've taken the app offline,
until the killer is caught.

53:18.470 --> 53:19.780
- When was the last time you had sex

53:19.780 --> 53:21.080
with the rideshare killer?

53:22.370 --> 53:24.343
- I was never intimate with him.

53:25.230 --> 53:27.050
I knew him in high school.

53:27.050 --> 53:28.460
We never dated.

53:28.460 --> 53:31.560
- Could I have a word with you, privately?

53:31.560 --> 53:33.840
- Actually, I was just leaving.

53:48.510 --> 53:50.763
- You did a good job tonight, slave.

53:51.899 --> 53:53.600
- (chuckles) Thanks.

53:53.600 --> 53:55.290
So, um...

53:55.290 --> 53:58.420
I was thinking maybe
we could do like dinner

53:58.420 --> 53:59.790
and maybe a movie, or something?

53:59.790 --> 54:00.623
- No.

54:02.550 --> 54:03.590
- Okay, but why-

54:03.590 --> 54:05.913
- You're not my boyfriend! Don't ruin it.

54:08.868 --> 54:11.368
(slave sighs)

54:13.958 --> 54:16.440
(grunts)

54:16.440 --> 54:17.273
Yeah.

54:18.369 --> 54:21.119
(car approaches)

54:22.120 --> 54:24.020
- Hey, ma'am, did you call for a ride?

54:25.040 --> 54:26.040
Come on, sweet lips!

54:26.040 --> 54:28.240
I don't have all day
to watch you suck face!

54:33.996 --> 54:35.720
(car bleeps)

54:35.720 --> 54:37.330
- When can I see you again?

54:37.330 --> 54:39.790
- When I ask you out!

54:39.790 --> 54:42.160
- No, okay? That doesn't
work for me anymore.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.520
- Okay!

54:43.520 --> 54:46.470
You can call me and ask me out.

54:46.470 --> 54:48.773
But we're goin' on no date.

54:51.160 --> 54:52.933
- No! That is not what I meant.

54:54.745 --> 54:56.494
(car door slams)

54:56.494 --> 54:59.494
(suspenseful music)

55:04.670 --> 55:07.990
- So, I noticed we're goin'
to that Rock n Ride house.

55:07.990 --> 55:09.620
You work for them?

55:09.620 --> 55:11.120
- I'm their creative director.

55:12.030 --> 55:13.410
- Yeah, you know, I used
to drive for that app,

55:13.410 --> 55:16.010
until they shut it down temporarily.

55:16.010 --> 55:17.980
A little warning would've been nice.

55:17.980 --> 55:19.253
- Okay. Sorry.

55:20.420 --> 55:22.270
- Is it too forward of me to ask

55:22.270 --> 55:23.920
what your relationship status is?

55:24.840 --> 55:27.820
- Well, that kid back
there isn't my boyfriend,

55:27.820 --> 55:29.270
if that's what you're asking.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.810
- That's exactly what I'm asking.

55:32.910 --> 55:34.140
- How old are you?

55:34.140 --> 55:35.083
- 29.

55:35.083 --> 55:37.870
(Naomi laughs)

55:37.870 --> 55:39.350
- Yeah.

55:39.350 --> 55:41.423
Right. (chuckles)

55:42.280 --> 55:43.113
It's cool.

55:44.035 --> 55:45.103
I'm 29, too.

55:45.970 --> 55:48.590
- With the recent revelation
that a serial killer has

55:48.590 --> 55:51.190
murdered both riders and
drivers at the ridesharing

55:51.190 --> 55:55.230
company Rock n Ride, the
entire sector has taken a hit.

55:55.230 --> 55:58.270
All major ride companies'
stocks have plummeted,

55:58.270 --> 56:00.730
resulting in nearly a 75% loss of value

56:00.730 --> 56:03.530
in the last few hours of trading.

56:03.530 --> 56:05.081
I'm Erin Rogers and this is channel...

56:05.081 --> 56:07.748
(button clicks)

56:20.647 --> 56:23.960
- Do you really think Billy is the killer?

56:23.960 --> 56:25.430
- You don't?

56:25.430 --> 56:26.263
- No.

56:27.200 --> 56:30.713
I mean, Billy's weird,
but he wasn't a killer.

56:32.475 --> 56:34.440
- I mean, why would he
have been in both locations

56:34.440 --> 56:35.640
where people got killed?

56:36.520 --> 56:37.763
- Maybe he was lured.

56:38.850 --> 56:42.220
I mean, the killer got
Rohan to the first location.

56:42.220 --> 56:43.170
- What about Rohan?

56:45.260 --> 56:48.073
- Rohan is a son of a bitch.

56:50.130 --> 56:52.573
But could he really be the killer?

56:58.070 --> 57:00.910
Can you email me everything
we have on Billy?

57:00.910 --> 57:04.973
His resume, his application,
his feedback, his driver logs.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.220
I wanna see everything we have on him.

57:08.220 --> 57:09.053
- Sure.

57:10.070 --> 57:12.070
Now I'm gonna take a couple Ambien,

57:12.070 --> 57:13.853
because I haven't slept in days.

57:14.793 --> 57:17.123
- Okay. I'll see you in the morning.

57:17.123 --> 57:18.790
- [Julia] Goodnight.

57:24.259 --> 57:26.689
(button clicks)
(chatter from TV)

57:26.689 --> 57:29.189
(door closes)

57:33.405 --> 57:35.905
(tense music)

57:48.903 --> 57:51.403
(Julia sighs)

57:56.049 --> 57:58.716
(button clicks)

58:08.940 --> 58:11.523
(mellow music)

58:12.640 --> 58:14.253
- [Woman] How can I help you, sir?

58:15.100 --> 58:17.523
- [Rohan] I need a girl. Someone new?

58:18.539 --> 58:21.433
- [Woman] Yes, sir. I have
Sarah, but she's 800 an hour.

58:22.410 --> 58:24.970
- Does she liked to be
slapped around a little bit?

58:24.970 --> 58:27.330
- [Woman] Yes, sir. She does.

58:27.330 --> 58:29.230
- All right. Send her over.

58:31.969 --> 58:34.552
(phone bleeps)

58:37.228 --> 58:39.811
(phone chimes)

58:43.720 --> 58:46.303
(phone clicks)

58:52.160 --> 58:53.330
(phone chimes)

58:53.330 --> 58:55.913
(phone clicks)

59:02.371 --> 59:04.954
(phone chimes)

59:14.537 --> 59:17.537
(muffled dog barks)

59:18.737 --> 59:21.237
(eerie music)

59:25.356 --> 59:27.939
(phone chimes)

59:30.146 --> 59:32.396
(creaking)

59:42.037 --> 59:45.418
(knife scrapes)

59:45.418 --> 59:46.706
(pants)

59:46.706 --> 59:47.607
(phone bleeps)

59:47.607 --> 59:49.043
(phone rings)

59:49.043 --> 59:50.640
- [Operator] 911. What's your emergency?

59:50.640 --> 59:53.520
- There's a fuckin'
serial killer in my house!

59:53.520 --> 59:55.378
- [Operator] Is he armed, sir?

59:55.378 --> 59:56.883
- I don't know. Probably.

59:57.820 --> 1:00:00.420
- [Operator] Please, stay calm, sir.

1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:01.570
- Please send somebody!

1:00:03.050 --> 1:00:05.300
- [Operator] Yes, sir.
They are on their way.

1:00:07.430 --> 1:00:09.030
Please stay on the line with me.

1:00:10.436 --> 1:00:12.156
Sir, are you still there?

1:00:12.156 --> 1:00:13.156
- Not for long!

1:00:13.156 --> 1:00:15.739
(knife clangs)

1:00:19.911 --> 1:00:24.494
(chokes)
(tense music)

1:00:28.387 --> 1:00:29.801
(body thumps)

1:00:29.801 --> 1:00:32.468
(fire crackles)

1:00:35.663 --> 1:00:40.663
(suspenseful music)
(muffled mellow music)

1:00:44.479 --> 1:00:47.146
(button clicks)

1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:10.230
- So, this is your place, huh?

1:01:10.230 --> 1:01:11.903
- Yep. This is it.

1:01:11.903 --> 1:01:13.908
- I like it. It's very bohemian.

1:01:13.908 --> 1:01:16.359
- (chuckles) I know,
right? It's kind of silly.

1:01:16.359 --> 1:01:18.600
- (chuckles) No, I like
it. It adds to the fantasy.

1:01:18.600 --> 1:01:22.760
- I'm a top. I like to be in charge.

1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:23.593
- I bet you do.

1:01:26.797 --> 1:01:29.130
(suspenseful music)

1:01:29.130 --> 1:01:30.728
- Excuse me!

1:01:30.728 --> 1:01:32.700
But I like to be on top.

1:01:32.700 --> 1:01:33.533
- So do I.

1:01:35.357 --> 1:01:37.857
(Naomi moans)

1:01:39.597 --> 1:01:42.180
(Naomi chokes)

1:01:48.089 --> 1:01:51.256
(Naomi chokes wildly)

1:01:56.657 --> 1:02:00.074
(Naomi coughs and gasps)

1:02:01.103 --> 1:02:02.830
Are you okay?

1:02:02.830 --> 1:02:04.993
- Jesus! What the fuck?

1:02:05.890 --> 1:02:07.963
- Sorry, was that too much?
- Yeah.

1:02:10.530 --> 1:02:11.963
Maybe a little.
- Sorry.

1:02:12.950 --> 1:02:14.500
Domination is sort of my thing.

1:02:16.910 --> 1:02:18.233
- Thanks for the warning.

1:02:20.260 --> 1:02:22.580
- Hey, where you goin'?
- Chill, dude.

1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:24.400
I gotta use the bathroom.

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:28.040
- Give me like five or ten
minutes, I'm good to go again.

1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:30.430
They don't call me "the
machine" for nothin'.

1:02:30.430 --> 1:02:32.810
- Are you gonna let me choke you?

1:02:32.810 --> 1:02:34.410
- Absolutely.

1:02:34.410 --> 1:02:35.763
- Stay right there.

1:02:42.229 --> 1:02:43.639
(door closes)

1:02:43.639 --> 1:02:46.727
(suspenseful music)

1:02:46.727 --> 1:02:49.394
(leaves rustle)

1:03:07.369 --> 1:03:10.786
(Billy gasps and grunts)

1:03:12.620 --> 1:03:15.200
- I know, baby. This is the last night.

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:17.885
I'll tuck you in tomorrow
night. I promise.

1:03:17.885 --> 1:03:20.286
(Billy chokes)

1:03:20.286 --> 1:03:21.869
I'll call you back.

1:03:26.036 --> 1:03:28.703
(switch clicks)

1:03:51.433 --> 1:03:54.016
(Billy chokes)

1:03:55.055 --> 1:03:57.555
(body thumps)

1:04:40.151 --> 1:04:44.384
What the...
(thud)

1:04:45.291 --> 1:04:48.291
(suspenseful music)

1:04:55.135 --> 1:04:57.718
(door rattles)

1:05:02.821 --> 1:05:03.995
(keyboard clacks)

1:05:03.995 --> 1:05:06.662
(leaves rustle)

1:05:19.370 --> 1:05:20.203
- Julia?

1:05:22.632 --> 1:05:23.465
Are you awake?

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:37.353
Officer?

1:05:42.930 --> 1:05:44.490
Hello?

1:05:44.490 --> 1:05:45.323
Officer?

1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:49.993
Hello?

1:05:53.530 --> 1:05:54.563
Is someone there?

1:06:00.255 --> 1:06:02.422
(screams)

1:06:03.563 --> 1:06:04.990
Julia!

1:06:04.990 --> 1:06:06.740
The killer's in the fucking garden!

1:06:07.725 --> 1:06:09.725
(gasps)

1:06:10.885 --> 1:06:12.968
(chokes)

1:06:30.603 --> 1:06:33.353
(crickets chirp)

1:06:42.670 --> 1:06:43.503
- Hey.

1:06:45.631 --> 1:06:47.480
Did you hear something?

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:49.330
- [Driver] Huh? What?

1:06:49.330 --> 1:06:51.511
- Why are you still here?

1:06:51.511 --> 1:06:52.344
Go home!

1:06:54.943 --> 1:06:56.500
- I thought I could buy you breakfast.

1:06:56.500 --> 1:06:57.453
- No, thanks.

1:06:58.880 --> 1:07:01.173
Go, please. Don't make this awkward.

1:07:02.692 --> 1:07:05.070
- All right. I'm outta here, sweet lips.

1:07:08.191 --> 1:07:09.709
All right, I'm goin'!

1:07:09.709 --> 1:07:10.949
Jesus.

1:07:10.949 --> 1:07:13.949
(suspenseful music)

1:07:16.580 --> 1:07:18.997
(rope snaps)

1:07:20.241 --> 1:07:22.561
(grunts)

1:07:22.561 --> 1:07:24.201
What the fu...

1:07:24.201 --> 1:07:26.201
(pants)

1:07:31.059 --> 1:07:33.767
(body thumps)

1:07:33.767 --> 1:07:36.267
(door creaks)

1:08:12.438 --> 1:08:16.425
- Fuck, dude, really? You need to go home.

1:08:16.425 --> 1:08:17.438
Who the fu...

1:08:17.438 --> 1:08:18.524
(chokes)

1:08:18.524 --> 1:08:23.107
(chokes)
(tense music)

1:08:57.925 --> 1:08:58.842
- Lorraine?

1:09:04.725 --> 1:09:06.310
(suspenseful music)

1:09:06.310 --> 1:09:07.323
- Oh, shit!

1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:09.650
Lorraine, did you see this?

1:09:23.682 --> 1:09:24.515
Lorraine!

1:09:25.602 --> 1:09:26.821
Lorraine!

1:09:26.821 --> 1:09:29.968
(door closes)

1:09:29.968 --> 1:09:32.488
(gasps)

1:09:32.488 --> 1:09:33.321
Oh, god.

1:09:42.670 --> 1:09:45.087
(door slams)

1:09:46.419 --> 1:09:49.002
(door rattles)

1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:51.473
(door rattles)

1:09:51.473 --> 1:09:53.303
I know who you are!

1:09:54.347 --> 1:09:56.560
(door rattles)

1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:58.690
Billy drove for TaxiQuick,

1:09:58.690 --> 1:10:00.800
the company you heavily invested in.

1:10:00.800 --> 1:10:03.383
(door rattles)

1:10:04.790 --> 1:10:06.333
I know it's you, James.

1:10:10.420 --> 1:10:12.730
I called the police and they're
gonna be here in a minute.

1:10:12.730 --> 1:10:14.800
- No, you didn't.

1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:17.470
Your phone is in your bedroom.

1:10:17.470 --> 1:10:18.773
- I used Lorraine's phone.

1:10:20.440 --> 1:10:21.390
- I have her phone.

1:10:25.419 --> 1:10:26.660
(phone clunks)

1:10:26.660 --> 1:10:29.040
When I was doing my due
diligence for TaxiQuick,

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:31.030
I took a bunch of rides.

1:10:31.030 --> 1:10:33.190
One of the first drivers I got was Billy.

1:10:33.190 --> 1:10:35.430
I could tell he was trouble.

1:10:35.430 --> 1:10:37.180
He had problems everywhere he went.

1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:41.330
So when he told me he
knew you in high school,

1:10:41.330 --> 1:10:43.539
it all fell into place.

1:10:43.539 --> 1:10:46.870
(door rattles)

1:10:46.870 --> 1:10:49.210
I can tell he was still in love with you.

1:10:49.210 --> 1:10:51.313
- No, he wasn't!
- Yes, he was.

1:10:52.160 --> 1:10:54.570
When I told him I was
interested in investing in you,

1:10:54.570 --> 1:10:57.290
and suggested he go work for Rock n Ride,

1:10:57.290 --> 1:11:00.050
to get me information about the company,

1:11:00.050 --> 1:11:01.480
he jumped at the chance.

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:03.230
Then it was just a matter

1:11:03.230 --> 1:11:05.810
of pointing the evidence towards him.

1:11:05.810 --> 1:11:07.163
He was the perfect patsy.

1:11:12.355 --> 1:11:14.772
(door slams)

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:18.933
- Why?

1:11:19.950 --> 1:11:22.230
Why do you wanna destroy me?

1:11:22.230 --> 1:11:23.260
- Oh, stop it.

1:11:23.260 --> 1:11:25.890
It's not about you and
your silly little company.

1:11:25.890 --> 1:11:28.450
It's about the entire industry!

1:11:28.450 --> 1:11:31.290
People will be afraid
to drive or take a ride.

1:11:31.290 --> 1:11:33.470
Hell, after tonight,

1:11:33.470 --> 1:11:36.110
people won't even wanna work
for a rideshare company.

1:11:36.110 --> 1:11:40.070
And the cab industry
will reap the rewards.

1:11:40.070 --> 1:11:43.460
- You're not gonna be able to
frame Billy for this tonight.

1:11:43.460 --> 1:11:45.610
- I have him tied up outside.

1:11:45.610 --> 1:11:49.480
Once I kill you, I will
mortally wound him,

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.690
and release him into the neighborhood.

1:11:51.690 --> 1:11:53.690
His body will be found blocks from here.

1:11:54.600 --> 1:11:57.710
With your DNA all over him.

1:11:57.710 --> 1:11:59.610
- You're not gonna get away with this.

1:12:00.550 --> 1:12:02.000
- I've gotten away with more.

1:12:02.913 --> 1:12:05.496
(door rattles)

1:12:08.414 --> 1:12:10.964
(Julia sobs)

1:12:10.964 --> 1:12:13.547
(door rattles)

1:12:17.766 --> 1:12:20.516
(window rattles)

1:12:22.185 --> 1:12:24.685
(lock clacks)

1:12:27.465 --> 1:12:32.465
(window scrapes)
(Julia grunts)

1:12:34.961 --> 1:12:37.544
(door rattles)

1:12:49.523 --> 1:12:52.023
(tense music)

1:12:56.508 --> 1:12:59.008
(Julia pants)

1:13:02.119 --> 1:13:04.619
(Julia gasps)

1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:33.860
- Julia!

1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:35.170
Are you out here?

1:14:35.170 --> 1:14:36.100
- Dad, run!

1:14:36.980 --> 1:14:38.170
- James, but...

1:14:38.170 --> 1:14:39.226
James!

1:14:39.226 --> 1:14:42.226
(groans and chokes)

1:14:49.242 --> 1:14:50.812
(body thumps)

1:14:50.812 --> 1:14:53.062
(grunting)

1:15:00.232 --> 1:15:04.669
(Julia grunts)
(thuds)

1:15:04.669 --> 1:15:07.169
(Julia pants)

1:15:14.099 --> 1:15:16.932
(machete scrapes)

1:15:19.037 --> 1:15:24.037
(machete thuds)
(James screams)

1:15:25.734 --> 1:15:27.890
- Mm, I like a feisty girl.

1:15:27.890 --> 1:15:29.403
I'm glad I saved you for last.

1:15:30.940 --> 1:15:32.160
You're just a little girl!

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:35.544
You can't hurt me with that.
You wouldn't even know how!

1:15:35.544 --> 1:15:38.392
(machete hacks)
(Julia grunts)

1:15:38.392 --> 1:15:42.142
(James chokes and splutters)

1:15:45.312 --> 1:15:48.062
(machete clunks)

1:15:56.244 --> 1:15:58.577
- [Julia] Dad! Are you okay?

1:16:00.506 --> 1:16:03.339
(Reginald coughs)

1:16:07.450 --> 1:16:10.030
- I'm sorry.
(melancholy piano music)

1:16:10.030 --> 1:16:10.943
You were right.

1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:13.960
I'm...

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:15.873
I'm never gonna doubt you again.

1:16:43.550 --> 1:16:45.940
- Are you looking for a safe rideshare?

1:16:45.940 --> 1:16:49.500
I'm Julia Altimari, CEO of
a brand new ridesharing app,

1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:52.290
created by women, for women.

1:16:52.290 --> 1:16:54.883
The drivers and the
passengers are all women.

1:16:59.570 --> 1:17:01.270
- Oh, sorry.

1:17:01.270 --> 1:17:03.240
No boys allowed, ever.

1:17:03.240 --> 1:17:05.000
I mean, like never, ever.

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:06.260
Good day.

1:17:06.260 --> 1:17:07.093
- Sorry!

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:15.200
