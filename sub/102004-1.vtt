02:45.990 --> 02:47.992
Why'd you take him
out of school again?

02:49.194 --> 02:51.463
How in the fuck do
you think that's okay?

02:52.598 --> 02:54.799
It's been difficult
for him there.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.504
He has a hard time with
the other kids emotionally.

02:59.571 --> 03:02.940
I really wish we could rethink
sending him to Cedar Creek.

03:06.345 --> 03:08.180
You know I can't
afford that shit, Carol!

03:08.213 --> 03:10.582
What are you trying to
do, just rub it in again?

03:10.616 --> 03:11.717
No, it's just-

03:11.750 --> 03:14.919
- What exactly do you think
has changed in the last month?

03:14.952 --> 03:16.155
Since yesterday?

03:17.489 --> 03:20.192
I don't have that kind of money!

03:20.225 --> 03:21.593
Besides, the kid
is 10 years old.

03:21.627 --> 03:22.994
He doesn't understand yet

03:23.027 --> 03:24.996
what it means to have
emotional problems.

03:26.231 --> 03:27.965
Now, where is that little shit?

03:31.303 --> 03:32.837
All he does is cost me money!

03:34.105 --> 03:35.873
He doesn't listen to me,

03:35.907 --> 03:37.609
he's got no respect for me

03:37.643 --> 03:38.976
and neither do you!

03:40.412 --> 03:41.513
Goddammit, Carol!

03:41.547 --> 03:44.149
You gotta stop picking him up
every time he starts crying.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.384
How's he ever gonna learn?

03:45.417 --> 03:46.318
He's trying.

03:47.653 --> 03:50.121
It is a difficult environment.

03:51.156 --> 03:53.891
You know how
withdrawn he can be.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.161
Well, it's probably all
the bullshit you spin him.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.531
You can't fill his head
with all this nonsense!

03:59.565 --> 04:00.499
I really don't think that-

04:00.532 --> 04:03.202
- I know you don't,
Carol, and that's obvious!

04:04.703 --> 04:06.438
I need that boy to have
an actual education,

04:06.472 --> 04:07.905
and he's not gonna get it

04:07.939 --> 04:09.375
if you keep picking
him up from school.

04:09.408 --> 04:12.009
He needs to to learn to not cry.

04:14.011 --> 04:16.047
He needs to learn
a little respect.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.915
Now, where is he?

04:17.949 --> 04:18.584
Please.

04:19.485 --> 04:20.319
Tim.

04:22.019 --> 04:23.020
Mark!

04:24.590 --> 04:25.524
Where are you?

04:25.557 --> 04:30.895
Please leave him alone.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.970
I know you're up here, kid.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.234
Alyssa here.

06:15.267 --> 06:16.435
Listen Alyssa, I know-

06:16.468 --> 06:17.769
Thanks for calling.

06:17.803 --> 06:19.705
I'm away right now, but
please leave me your info

06:19.738 --> 06:21.273
and I'll call ya back.

06:21.306 --> 06:22.441
Ciao!

06:24.443 --> 06:25.677
Alyssa, listen.

06:26.812 --> 06:28.780
I know what's really
going on here.

06:28.814 --> 06:31.583
Okay, I understand the
reality of our situation.

06:32.618 --> 06:35.119
You've always been great
at coming up with excuses

06:35.153 --> 06:36.288
and disguising the truth.

06:36.955 --> 06:38.657
As a matter of fact,
you're so good at it,

06:38.690 --> 06:40.225
sometimes you even
fool yourself.

06:41.627 --> 06:45.297
But honestly, I'm astounded
at your lack of insight.

06:45.330 --> 06:47.466
You thought your decision
was for my benefit?

06:47.499 --> 06:49.134
But you did it for yourself.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.402
You were thinking first and
foremost about yourself,

06:50.435 --> 06:52.337
just as everyone always does.

06:54.306 --> 06:56.842
I know part of the reason
you decided to leave me

06:56.875 --> 07:00.379
was because you grew tired
of me over-analyzing things.

07:02.113 --> 07:02.748
You know what?

07:04.516 --> 07:06.618
You don't have to worry
about that anymore

07:07.853 --> 07:09.555
'cause I'm not gonna be
around here much longer

07:09.588 --> 07:13.057
'cause I'm gonna-

07:14.860 --> 07:16.295
Fuck!

07:22.467 --> 07:23.368
Goddamn it!

07:32.911 --> 07:34.179
Who is it?

07:34.212 --> 07:34.846
No one.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.113
It's nothing.

07:38.684 --> 07:41.219
Then go back to sleep.

09:02.434 --> 09:03.235
Hi, Mark.

09:04.870 --> 09:05.971
Hi, Mom.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.205
How are you doing?

09:07.239 --> 09:08.540
Is everything okay?

09:08.573 --> 09:10.742
It's been kind of a long time.

09:10.776 --> 09:11.610
I know.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.715
I'm simply calling
to say goodbye.

09:18.016 --> 09:18.950
What do you mean goodbye?

09:18.984 --> 09:20.185
Where are you going?

09:22.020 --> 09:24.856
I'm just leaving,

09:27.325 --> 09:28.226
going out of town.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.597
I'm gonna be gone for a while

09:32.631 --> 09:36.268
and I just wanted
to say goodbye.

09:37.669 --> 09:38.737
Oh okay.

09:38.770 --> 09:40.205
What's really going on?

09:41.373 --> 09:43.241
Are you still
seeing your doctor?

09:44.009 --> 09:45.243
Nothing.

09:45.277 --> 09:47.312
And yes, I am.

09:47.345 --> 09:49.214
Are you out of your
medication again?

09:54.052 --> 09:55.353
Mark?

09:55.387 --> 09:57.856
No, it's nothing like that.

09:57.889 --> 09:58.957
Okay, I'm...

10:00.625 --> 10:01.960
I haven't talked
to you for a while

10:01.993 --> 10:04.463
and I just wanted to say

10:04.496 --> 10:06.465
that I'm leaving, okay.

10:06.498 --> 10:07.365
That's all.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.267
I'm praying for you, Mark.

10:09.301 --> 10:10.635
Mom, please.

10:10.669 --> 10:12.337
Don't waste your breath.

10:12.370 --> 10:13.939
It's
not a waste, Mark.

10:13.972 --> 10:15.741
I know God can help
you, if you just-

10:15.774 --> 10:17.743
- What, if I believe?

10:17.776 --> 10:18.910
Yes.

10:18.944 --> 10:21.780
So God's help is
predicated on belief?

10:21.813 --> 10:23.815
Does God's existence
also work that way?

10:23.849 --> 10:26.384
If people stop believing,
he ceases to exist?

10:26.418 --> 10:27.252
Of course not.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.288
I know you don't
believe anymore, Mark,

10:30.322 --> 10:32.290
but he still exists.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.793
And he still loves you,

10:35.827 --> 10:37.028
just like I do.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.535
Mark?

10:43.568 --> 10:44.402
Mark?

10:47.706 --> 10:49.875
I don't believe
in anything anymore.

10:52.410 --> 10:53.411
I don't wanna argue.

10:55.413 --> 10:56.681
I just wanna say goodbye.

11:11.130 --> 11:12.531
Oh, Mark.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.531
Yeah, she's a beauty.

12:54.799 --> 12:57.769
Super smooth, quick
cylinder rotation.

12:57.802 --> 12:59.938
A lotta stopping power.

13:01.539 --> 13:02.741
An old classic.

13:03.842 --> 13:05.043
That's good.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.678
This should probably work.

13:08.013 --> 13:10.582
So it is for you?

13:10.615 --> 13:12.584
Or your husband?

13:12.617 --> 13:13.919
I mean, if you're
married and all.

13:13.952 --> 13:14.753
Yes.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.588
My husband.

13:18.123 --> 13:20.458
Well, that oughta
make him happy.

13:22.228 --> 13:23.428
Not likely.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.539
You're gonna need some
ammunition, of course, huh?

13:34.572 --> 13:35.573
Yes.

13:38.977 --> 13:42.013
These are self-loaded,
hollow point rounds.

13:43.581 --> 13:45.116
I reloaded 'em myself.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.024
But we might, uh, have to
keep that on the down-low.

13:53.058 --> 13:54.693
Why's that?

13:54.726 --> 13:58.863
Well, they're loaded a
little beyond regulation.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.934
And technically I'm not
supposed to sell them here.

14:04.869 --> 14:08.640
But I guarantee you,
these are what you want.

14:18.049 --> 14:18.984
Can I help?

14:19.017 --> 14:20.986
No thanks, honey, that's okay.

14:21.019 --> 14:23.989
Go outside and play
with Russell, okay?

14:24.022 --> 14:29.027
Okay.

15:50.242 --> 15:51.143
Goddamn it!

16:09.994 --> 16:14.999
Most people simply underestimate
the power of intention.

16:16.168 --> 16:18.636
It's all about The
Law of Attraction.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.373
You get what you think about.

16:21.407 --> 16:24.976
You manifest it with your
intention and your desire.

16:25.009 --> 16:26.644
It's pretty plain and simple.

16:26.678 --> 16:29.881
All a person needs to do is
focus on a positive thing

16:29.914 --> 16:32.384
and a positive
thing will happen.

16:32.418 --> 16:34.420
It works the same way
with a negative too.

16:34.453 --> 16:35.854
Very true.

16:35.887 --> 16:38.157
My ex, he was so
full of negativity.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.158
I couldn't handle it.

16:39.191 --> 16:40.859
Apparently neither could he.

16:40.892 --> 16:43.728
His negativity got
him fired from his job

16:43.761 --> 16:45.164
so I had to leave him.

16:45.197 --> 16:46.764
See that's
exactly what I mean!

16:46.798 --> 16:51.403
He totally manifested
that in his life.

16:51.437 --> 16:53.905
Just have to not
let it get you down.

16:53.938 --> 16:56.342
What I like to do is
I make a vision board

16:56.375 --> 16:59.411
and on it I put things that
are positive and helpful.

16:59.445 --> 17:02.448
And on a quantum level, things
will start to shift for you.

17:04.215 --> 17:05.184
Excuse me.

17:05.217 --> 17:07.018
Were you rolling
your eyes at me?

17:07.050 --> 17:07.852
No.

17:09.387 --> 17:10.289
No, I wasn't.

17:10.321 --> 17:12.824
Yes, you were. I saw you.

17:12.857 --> 17:15.294
Fine. I did.

17:15.327 --> 17:16.694
How dare you!

17:16.728 --> 17:18.164
Ma'am, let me
ask you a question.

17:18.196 --> 17:19.431
What kind of medication
are you here for?

17:19.464 --> 17:21.433
That's none of your business!

17:21.467 --> 17:23.202
Do you wanna know why
I was rolling my eyes?

17:23.234 --> 17:24.068
Yes, I do!

17:24.102 --> 17:25.803
Well, then tell me
what kind of medication

17:25.837 --> 17:26.905
you're here for.

17:26.938 --> 17:28.773
I will not!

17:28.806 --> 17:29.774
Fine.

17:29.807 --> 17:31.809
Is it insulin?

17:33.111 --> 17:34.180
A diuretic?

17:34.213 --> 17:35.381
It's insulin.

17:35.414 --> 17:37.249
But that's none
of your business.

17:37.283 --> 17:39.185
Why do you even need insulin?

17:39.218 --> 17:40.352
Haven't you spent enough time

17:40.386 --> 17:42.454
visualizing yourself
getting better?

17:42.488 --> 17:44.923
Why haven't you intended your
way right out of diabetes?

17:44.956 --> 17:46.791
Hell, why do you
even need a pharmacy?

17:46.824 --> 17:47.992
It's not how it works.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.795
You don't understand!

17:50.828 --> 17:51.696
Next please.

17:53.831 --> 17:54.466
Ma'am?

17:55.501 --> 17:56.368
Ma'am.

18:05.777 --> 18:06.844
People.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.572
9-1-1,
what is your emergency?

19:40.606 --> 19:42.073
Yes, there's a house on fire!

19:42.106 --> 19:43.908
Okay, ma'am,
what is your vicinity?

19:51.617 --> 19:52.484
That might be too late.

19:52.518 --> 19:54.186
I need to check and see
if someone's in there.

19:54.219 --> 19:55.587
Ma'am, do
not go into that house.

19:55.621 --> 19:57.289
Be safe and keep clear.

19:59.625 --> 20:00.858
Hello!

20:02.161 --> 20:03.027
Hello, anyone?

20:08.534 --> 20:09.635
Hello!

20:09.668 --> 20:10.502
Anyone?

20:12.103 --> 20:15.207
Oh, shit.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.975
Oh my God, wake
up, wake up, wake up!

20:22.046 --> 20:24.115
Come on, your house is on fire!

20:25.384 --> 20:26.618
Oh Jesus, you're
alive!

20:26.652 --> 20:27.619
No, I'm not.

20:27.653 --> 20:29.254
No, I'm not.

20:29.288 --> 20:30.289
What?

20:30.322 --> 20:32.491
Your house is on fire!

20:32.524 --> 20:33.459
Come on!

20:36.662 --> 20:38.664
Just leave me here.

20:38.697 --> 20:39.897
What?

20:39.931 --> 20:41.166
No!

20:41.200 --> 20:42.234
We're getting out
of here, right now.

20:42.267 --> 20:43.535
Come on!

20:43.569 --> 20:46.037
Oh, geez, you make
me do all the work.

21:00.084 --> 21:02.554
I don't
know if I can do this!

21:27.513 --> 21:28.447
What's that?

21:28.480 --> 21:30.182
You mean the sirens?

21:31.115 --> 21:33.585
The fire department, obviously!

21:36.188 --> 21:37.656
What are they doing?

21:39.056 --> 21:41.427
They're coming to
put out the fire.

21:44.596 --> 21:47.733
Shit, shit.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.306
What are you doing?

21:54.339 --> 21:56.375
What are you doing?

22:02.648 --> 22:03.449
What are you doing?

22:03.482 --> 22:04.383
You've been badly hurt!

22:04.416 --> 22:06.618
You need to go to a hospital.

22:06.652 --> 22:08.119
I'm leaving.

22:08.153 --> 22:10.988
Don't try and drive
yourself to the hospital!

22:11.022 --> 22:12.491
Let the ambulance take you.

22:12.524 --> 22:14.493
I'm not going to
the fucking hospital.

22:16.027 --> 22:17.463
You can't just...

22:17.496 --> 22:18.263
What?

22:18.297 --> 22:20.097
What is wrong with you?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.301
Hey, hey!

22:32.377 --> 22:34.279
I just saved your life!

23:33.839 --> 23:34.806
Fuck.

23:53.859 --> 23:55.294
Hello?

23:55.327 --> 23:57.596
Hello,
is this Mark James?

23:57.629 --> 23:58.463
Yeah.

24:00.198 --> 24:01.433
Who's this?

24:01.466 --> 24:02.701
This is Suzanne.

24:02.734 --> 24:04.436
I'm a nurse at Good
Samaritan Hospital.

24:04.469 --> 24:06.471
I'm calling on behalf
of Carol James.

24:07.773 --> 24:09.508
She's your mother,
is that correct?

24:11.276 --> 24:12.109
Wait.

24:13.779 --> 24:15.180
What's wrong?

24:15.213 --> 24:16.582
I'm
sorry to tell you this,

24:16.615 --> 24:18.216
but she's been in
a car accident.

24:18.951 --> 24:21.085
She's unconscious, but
we have stabilized her.

24:24.790 --> 24:25.624
Mark?

24:26.825 --> 24:27.826
Are you still there?

24:31.396 --> 24:32.864
We would like you to
come to the hospital

24:32.898 --> 24:36.468
and fill out some paperwork
at your earliest convenience.

24:36.501 --> 24:39.404
And I'm sure she'll wanna
see you when she wakes up.

25:13.939 --> 25:15.273
Come on!

25:28.887 --> 25:29.721
Put it in back.

25:30.555 --> 25:33.291
- But-
- I said put it in the back!

25:40.298 --> 25:41.299
Hey.

26:17.035 --> 26:18.537
Get out of the truck.

26:20.272 --> 26:22.474
Get out of the fucking truck.

26:28.647 --> 26:29.481
Where's Mom?

26:34.920 --> 26:35.754
Follow me.

26:40.058 --> 26:41.827
That's my
homework packet!

26:43.962 --> 26:46.398
This isn't homework.

26:52.304 --> 26:54.039
Your mom's got a
lotta issues, kid,

26:54.072 --> 26:56.742
and pharmaceuticals
are one of 'em.

26:56.775 --> 26:59.311
You shouldn't be putting
too much trust in her.

27:02.314 --> 27:04.416
Shouldn't really trust
anyone or anything.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.788
Your mom reads a lotta bullshit.

27:09.821 --> 27:12.023
Don't let her fill up your
head with that nonsense.

27:12.057 --> 27:12.924
Look at me!

27:15.694 --> 27:18.563
Anything you believe in is
eventually gonna let you down.

27:20.398 --> 27:22.467
You gotta start focusing
on what's practical.

27:24.736 --> 27:26.304
Don't put your
trust in anything.

27:26.338 --> 27:29.040
Not God, not yourself,

27:29.074 --> 27:31.943
not your artwork, nothin'.

27:35.580 --> 27:36.982
Now, get back in that truck.

28:34.472 --> 28:35.073
Fuck.

28:58.496 --> 28:59.497
Fuck.

29:02.701 --> 29:03.535
God!

29:04.836 --> 29:05.670
Fuck!

29:33.698 --> 29:36.434
How could you do
that without talking to me?

29:36.468 --> 29:38.403
How in the fuck can you do that?

29:40.839 --> 29:42.073
I've tried
talking to you.

29:42.107 --> 29:44.509
It was a bad environment.

29:44.542 --> 29:46.511
He needed a better one.

29:46.544 --> 29:48.713
And I told you, I can't afford
to send him anywhere else!

29:48.747 --> 29:49.581
Don't you listen?

29:51.016 --> 29:53.652
Or are you too busy paying
attention to your own thoughts?

29:53.685 --> 29:55.720
I do pay attention.

29:55.754 --> 29:58.190
I know we can't afford
to send him anywhere,

29:58.224 --> 30:00.558
and that's why I'm
going to homeschool him.

30:01.493 --> 30:03.929
Well, it still costs money!

30:03.962 --> 30:07.465
Besides, you're gonna teach him?

30:07.499 --> 30:08.134
Yes.

30:10.502 --> 30:12.238
And you think you can do that.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.471
I believe I can.

30:15.106 --> 30:16.007
Highly doubtful.

30:18.009 --> 30:19.678
Besides, he needs the experience

30:19.711 --> 30:21.147
of a regular public school.

30:21.180 --> 30:23.548
I cannot believe you
took him out like that

30:23.581 --> 30:25.817
right in the middle of the year.

30:25.850 --> 30:28.586
Goddammit, Carol, we gotta
talk about those things.

30:28.620 --> 30:32.557
Again, Tim, I
tried talking to you.

30:32.590 --> 30:34.626
Then why don't I remember?

30:34.659 --> 30:37.696
I'm pretty fucking
sure I'd remember.

30:37.729 --> 30:42.100
Well, Tim, you
were probably drunk.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.869
Oh!

30:44.903 --> 30:46.972
And that means I
wouldn't remember?

30:49.607 --> 30:52.577
I can't take this anymore!

30:52.610 --> 30:53.611
God.

30:55.880 --> 30:56.915
Stupid bitch.

31:04.323 --> 31:05.490
What's this?

31:06.658 --> 31:07.993
We're leaving.

31:08.026 --> 31:08.893
You're leaving?

31:09.894 --> 31:10.929
Where the hell are you going?

31:10.962 --> 31:12.731
To a hotel.

31:12.764 --> 31:13.765
Head on out, honey.

31:13.798 --> 31:14.799
What about Russell?

31:14.833 --> 31:15.633
He'll be fine.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.268
Please go.

31:16.302 --> 31:18.036
Mark!

31:18.069 --> 31:19.004
Stay right there.

31:19.037 --> 31:20.038
You're not going anywhere.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.276
So you think you can leave
me just like that, do ya?

31:24.310 --> 31:25.110
Yes.

31:26.077 --> 31:27.912
We need a break.

31:27.946 --> 31:29.281
We can talk about
this over the phone.

31:29.315 --> 31:31.183
You need to get some help.

31:31.217 --> 31:32.917
I need to get some help?

31:34.652 --> 31:35.887
Oh, you're the one
taking all the pills

31:35.920 --> 31:36.988
and reading all that bullshit.

31:37.022 --> 31:38.023
You don't know what
to think, Carol!

31:38.056 --> 31:39.258
Mark, go wait in the car.

31:39.291 --> 31:40.159
- He's not going anywhere!
- Oh wait!

31:40.192 --> 31:42.228
- No, let go of his arm.
- He's my son isn't-

31:42.261 --> 31:43.094
- You're hurting him!

31:55.673 --> 31:57.075
Oh.

31:57.108 --> 31:58.676
Where the hell did you get that?

32:00.279 --> 32:01.079
Fine.

32:01.746 --> 32:03.315
Fine, you wanna fuckin' leave?

32:03.349 --> 32:04.115
Go.

32:04.150 --> 32:05.784
Fuckin' go.

32:05.817 --> 32:09.188
You are not gonna
do this to us anymore!

32:09.221 --> 32:10.989
I am not gonna let you.

32:13.725 --> 32:15.560
Well, apparently.

32:25.970 --> 32:27.605
Fuck!

32:27.639 --> 32:28.274
Fuck!

33:12.884 --> 33:14.386
Goddamn it!

33:14.420 --> 33:16.888
That was a close one!

33:16.921 --> 33:18.857
Why, why, why, why?

33:18.890 --> 33:22.428
Why, why, why, I saved
your life for God sake!

33:22.461 --> 33:23.429
I saved your life.

33:23.462 --> 33:24.662
I didn't ask for it!

33:25.797 --> 33:27.765
What, you were
gonna kill yourself?

33:29.301 --> 33:31.636
Looks like you've tried
more than once already.

33:37.443 --> 33:38.776
What's your name, son?

33:40.044 --> 33:41.213
It doesn't matter.

33:41.247 --> 33:42.080
Does to me.

33:44.316 --> 33:45.451
You'll forget it eventually

33:45.484 --> 33:46.784
along with this
whole conversation,

33:46.818 --> 33:48.354
so it really won't matter.

33:49.787 --> 33:51.956
I see. Is that what you want?

33:51.990 --> 33:53.192
You wanna be remembered?

33:55.927 --> 33:57.762
Let's get up off of
the sidewalk, okay?

33:57.795 --> 33:59.063
Come on, I'll buy you a coffee.

33:59.097 --> 34:00.064
I don't think so.

34:04.270 --> 34:05.271
All right.

34:10.208 --> 34:11.876
I remember my
daughter's struggle.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.248
About six years ago
she was diagnosed

34:17.283 --> 34:18.750
with stage four cancer.

34:20.252 --> 34:23.788
Up until then, she was one of
the happiest people on Earth,

34:23.821 --> 34:25.391
but the chemo changed all that.

34:26.824 --> 34:29.960
She lost perspective.

34:31.829 --> 34:35.434
She was convinced that
she was gonna end it all.

34:37.303 --> 34:39.804
And she tried once and failed.

34:39.837 --> 34:41.940
That wasn't a call
for help either.

34:41.973 --> 34:43.375
She just wasn't successful.

34:46.512 --> 34:47.779
But in that failed attempt

34:48.846 --> 34:51.250
she found a new perspective.

34:51.283 --> 34:55.487
She realized that her
life was worth something

34:55.521 --> 34:56.853
even through the suffering.

34:59.123 --> 35:00.392
She survive the cancer?

35:02.561 --> 35:03.795
Uh, no.

35:05.029 --> 35:06.532
Cancer took her two years ago.

35:06.565 --> 35:08.500
But the important thing is

35:08.534 --> 35:12.238
that she gained the
right perspective.

35:12.271 --> 35:15.840
She found a truth that
life's worth living

35:15.873 --> 35:17.875
no matter what
the circumstances.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.516
I don't know you.

35:24.550 --> 35:26.552
I have no idea what
you've been through.

35:26.585 --> 35:27.852
But no matter how tough it is,

35:27.885 --> 35:29.787
there are reasons
to keep living.

35:30.888 --> 35:33.057
You just have to
find the right one.

35:33.091 --> 35:34.993
Human beings have
no reason to live

35:35.026 --> 35:36.794
outside biological function.

35:38.896 --> 35:41.567
Anything beyond that
is simply fabricated.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.835
Well, that is one
sad perspective.

35:46.938 --> 35:49.441
I think you just have to
find what's true for you.

35:50.908 --> 35:52.378
It's different for everybody.

35:54.946 --> 35:58.049
So the truth changes depending
on your interpretation?

36:00.619 --> 36:02.854
That's not a very complete
view of the truth.

36:04.356 --> 36:05.357
But if you're right,

36:06.924 --> 36:08.160
then my interpretation

36:08.193 --> 36:09.861
is that life really
isn't worth living.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.499
Maybe you just haven't
found the right truth yet.

36:16.602 --> 36:18.102
I'm gonna call you an ambulance.

36:18.137 --> 36:19.904
I don't need one.

36:19.937 --> 36:21.440
I think it
would be a good idea.

36:21.473 --> 36:23.941
I think it'd be a good idea
if you just left me alone.

36:26.211 --> 36:27.078
All right.

36:29.281 --> 36:31.417
I can't give you help
if you don't want it.

36:32.950 --> 36:33.885
All right?

36:35.953 --> 36:38.524
I hope you find
the truth you need.

36:49.268 --> 36:50.235
I already have.

37:43.555 --> 37:44.922
What the hell are you doin'?

37:44.956 --> 37:46.558
Nothin'. What do you mean?

37:46.592 --> 37:48.694
You keep fuckin'
with that thing.

37:48.727 --> 37:49.894
Put it away.

37:51.430 --> 37:54.666
I keep tellin' ya the
only way to make this work

37:54.700 --> 37:57.436
is to be ready but not
give anything away.

37:58.504 --> 38:00.004
I am.

38:00.037 --> 38:01.440
Not when you're
fuckin' around.

38:02.307 --> 38:03.941
You gotta be focused.

38:03.975 --> 38:07.179
You gotta be completely
sure of yourself.

38:07.212 --> 38:08.045
I am.

38:14.186 --> 38:15.687
Look, here one comes now.

38:15.721 --> 38:18.055
Oh, this'll be easy,
he's already fucked up.

38:33.104 --> 38:33.971
Give it to us.

38:35.072 --> 38:36.408
I said give it to us!

38:38.210 --> 38:39.445
It?

38:39.478 --> 38:41.012
You
know what he means.

38:42.214 --> 38:43.582
Actually, I have no
idea what he means.

38:43.615 --> 38:44.616
Money, damn it!

38:44.650 --> 38:47.051
Give us your wallet or will
gut you like a stuck pig!

38:48.754 --> 38:50.355
I see.

38:50.389 --> 38:52.191
You need a fix, is that it?

38:52.224 --> 38:54.760
Just give us your fucking
money you piece of shit.

38:54.793 --> 38:56.595
You want my money so
you can further fuck up

38:56.628 --> 38:58.330
your already pathetic lives?

38:58.363 --> 38:59.964
I will cut you.

39:01.433 --> 39:02.267
Fine.

39:03.669 --> 39:04.503
Cut me.

39:06.772 --> 39:08.607
Don't test me!

39:08.640 --> 39:11.075
Your life's in my
hands right now.

39:11.108 --> 39:13.345
It's my choice whether
you live or die.

39:13.378 --> 39:14.246
No, it isn't.

39:15.447 --> 39:17.249
You'll either kill
me or you won't.

39:18.550 --> 39:20.519
We're all just automatons
determined to act

39:20.552 --> 39:22.421
in whatever way our
dominant needs and desires

39:22.454 --> 39:24.356
compel us to act.

39:24.389 --> 39:25.624
What?

39:25.657 --> 39:27.226
See, life is just
a series of reactions

39:27.259 --> 39:29.026
over which we have no control.

39:29.060 --> 39:32.331
So either you'll
kill me or you won't.

39:33.532 --> 39:35.066
You really don't get to choose.

39:36.134 --> 39:38.270
Besides, he's holding the knife.

39:39.538 --> 39:41.005
Fucking cut him, man.

39:43.074 --> 39:46.678
I don't know, man.

39:46.712 --> 39:48.280
Well, just do it!

39:49.681 --> 39:50.482
Listen to him.

39:52.417 --> 39:53.619
Slit my throat.

39:55.354 --> 39:56.288
You want my money,

39:57.556 --> 39:58.323
and I don't wanna live.

39:58.357 --> 39:59.191
It's a win-win.

40:02.561 --> 40:05.664
Oh, Jesus Christ, how long
does this have to take?

40:08.233 --> 40:10.536
Ah shit, it's the cops.

40:54.212 --> 40:54.780
Fuck!

41:08.226 --> 41:10.696
Yeah, let's go up the slide.

41:39.257 --> 41:40.124
Mark?

41:41.393 --> 41:43.895
Alyssa just told me
about your voicemail.

41:43.929 --> 41:46.231
She's really worried about you.

41:46.264 --> 41:48.166
Why would she tell you?

41:48.200 --> 41:49.868
She said she didn't
think it was a good idea

41:49.901 --> 41:52.204
to talk to you and wanted me to.

41:54.272 --> 41:55.273
Okay.

41:58.276 --> 41:59.778
Well, talk.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.513
She let me listen
to the voicemail

42:01.546 --> 42:04.449
and we're both pretty concerned.

42:04.483 --> 42:05.317
Why?

42:06.218 --> 42:07.185
She doesn't give a shit.

42:07.219 --> 42:09.521
Well, obviously she does.

42:09.554 --> 42:10.422
So do I.

42:12.991 --> 42:15.560
Are you really
thinking of doing it?

42:15.594 --> 42:16.561
Not thinking of.

42:18.230 --> 42:18.830
Doing.

42:18.864 --> 42:20.232
Jesus, Mark!

42:21.233 --> 42:22.668
You're just giving up?

42:22.701 --> 42:24.603
You wouldn't understand.

42:24.636 --> 42:25.570
You're right.

42:25.604 --> 42:27.305
I don't understand.

42:27.339 --> 42:29.474
How could you choose
to end your life?

42:29.508 --> 42:31.777
Aren't you at all afraid
of what might happen?

42:33.011 --> 42:34.246
No.

42:35.847 --> 42:37.983
But you're afraid, apparently.

42:38.016 --> 42:40.452
See, death isn't
a reality to you.

42:41.586 --> 42:43.321
Like most people, you
put so much effort

42:43.355 --> 42:45.691
into ignoring and
disguising death

42:45.724 --> 42:47.325
that when you encounter someone

42:47.359 --> 42:50.962
who's chosen to embrace
it, it's unnerving.

42:50.996 --> 42:54.366
I think you're really
choosing to embrace

42:54.399 --> 42:55.634
the easy way out
of your problems.

42:55.667 --> 42:58.003
I'm convinced
there's a better way.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.271
No, it's not that easy.

43:00.906 --> 43:01.773
Or that simple.

43:03.275 --> 43:04.209
Maybe not.

43:05.877 --> 43:07.979
But I think you'd really
be missing out on life

43:08.013 --> 43:09.347
if you just give up.

43:10.816 --> 43:14.453
I am absolutely sure you
can get through this.

43:14.486 --> 43:16.221
You have a lot of
potential, Mark.

43:17.756 --> 43:19.791
You're not a very
empirically-minded person, Andrew.

43:20.826 --> 43:23.595
So you'll forgive me if I
don't appreciate your thoughts

43:23.628 --> 43:25.030
on my potential.

43:25.063 --> 43:26.998
And you're a fairly
close-minded person, Mark.

43:27.032 --> 43:27.933
Close-minded?

43:27.966 --> 43:29.468
Are you fucking kidding me?

43:29.501 --> 43:32.270
You're so sure of your
perception of reality

43:32.304 --> 43:34.606
and its bleak nature
that you've decided

43:34.639 --> 43:36.041
the only thing to
do is to leave it.

43:36.074 --> 43:38.944
And you believe whatever
you're prompted to believe

43:38.977 --> 43:40.779
at any given moment
without any doubt.

43:40.812 --> 43:42.681
That's close-minded, Andrew.

43:42.714 --> 43:45.283
At least I understand
that in my conclusions

43:45.317 --> 43:47.652
there's always room
for new information.

43:47.686 --> 43:49.521
You're always so
absolute with yours.

43:49.554 --> 43:52.390
Well, I think your
conclusion is unrealistic.

43:53.959 --> 43:55.627
Honestly, Mark, I
don't wanna have

43:55.660 --> 43:57.763
another philosophical argument.

43:57.796 --> 43:59.631
I just wanna help.

43:59.664 --> 44:02.300
Well, you can't, okay?

44:02.334 --> 44:04.636
You don't understand
my situation.

44:04.669 --> 44:06.037
And you clearly don't
know what it's like

44:06.071 --> 44:08.540
to have doubts about life
because you trust your intuition

44:08.573 --> 44:10.041
more than you trust facts.

44:10.075 --> 44:12.978
Well, that's something
you can't seem to do,

44:13.011 --> 44:14.279
trust your intuition.

44:16.448 --> 44:19.651
I do think you
can get through this.

44:19.684 --> 44:22.454
I'm convinced you can do
anything you set your mind to.

44:23.421 --> 44:24.589
Okay.

44:24.623 --> 44:27.392
You know how much I
hate inane platitudes.

44:27.425 --> 44:28.393
I'm done talking to you.

44:28.426 --> 44:29.861
No, wait, Mark.

44:29.895 --> 44:30.662
Where are you?

44:30.695 --> 44:31.797
Let me pick you up.

44:31.830 --> 44:33.431
I don't think so, Andrew.

44:34.133 --> 44:35.534
You don't care
about me that much

44:35.567 --> 44:37.402
otherwise you wouldn't
be sleeping with Alyssa.

44:37.435 --> 44:38.470
What?

44:38.503 --> 44:39.805
Did she tell you that?

44:39.838 --> 44:42.440
Heh, you two
are so much alike.

44:43.642 --> 44:45.710
You called me to make
yourself feel better.

44:45.744 --> 44:46.978
That's not true.

44:51.983 --> 44:53.451
Shit!

44:53.485 --> 44:55.620
Christ, kid, that was close.

44:56.588 --> 44:58.089
Sammy, you scared me to death!

44:58.123 --> 44:59.958
You can't go running
off like that.

44:59.991 --> 45:00.792
Are you okay?

45:01.993 --> 45:02.861
Oh, come here.

45:06.464 --> 45:09.334
Thank you so much.

45:10.136 --> 45:11.736
It's... it's no problem.

45:15.473 --> 45:16.441
Are you all right?

45:16.474 --> 45:18.476
You look pretty beat up.

45:19.145 --> 45:19.878
I'm fine.

45:19.911 --> 45:23.448
I just had a little
accident is all.

45:23.481 --> 45:24.583
Wow.

45:24.616 --> 45:27.118
Well, I'm really
grateful you saved Sammy

45:27.153 --> 45:28.720
from a big accident!

45:28.753 --> 45:31.089
Really, it's no problem.

45:33.491 --> 45:35.760
Well, do you live around here?

45:37.529 --> 45:38.363
Yeah, not far.

45:39.198 --> 45:41.867
Are you sure you're okay?

45:41.900 --> 45:42.868
Do you need any help?

45:42.901 --> 45:43.902
No, I'm fine.

45:43.935 --> 45:45.036
Well good.

45:47.772 --> 45:48.907
How long have you lived here?

45:48.940 --> 45:50.008
Do you like it?

45:50.041 --> 45:51.610
Yeah, it's fine.

45:51.643 --> 45:53.912
I've been here for
several years now-

45:53.945 --> 45:55.614
- Oh, good!

45:55.647 --> 45:57.682
I'm asking because I don't
know many people here,

45:57.716 --> 46:00.186
and I wanna make sure it's a
good place for me and my son.

46:00.219 --> 46:02.621
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to bother you,

46:02.654 --> 46:04.022
but do you like
it enough to stay?

46:04.055 --> 46:05.624
Do you think you'll
live here a long time?

46:05.657 --> 46:07.025
Yeah, not much longer.

46:07.058 --> 46:07.826
Oh really?

46:07.859 --> 46:09.060
Why is that?

46:10.196 --> 46:11.830
Look, I've gotta go, okay?

46:11.863 --> 46:13.165
I'm sorry.

46:13.199 --> 46:15.066
Oh, okay, no problem.

46:16.067 --> 46:19.537
Well, I can't thank you
enough for rescuing Sammy.

46:21.940 --> 46:23.408
Oh, you're a hero!

46:26.845 --> 46:29.114
Did you tell him
we were sleeping together?

46:29.148 --> 46:30.715
No.

46:30.749 --> 46:33.952
He was always able to
figure out my secrets.

46:33.985 --> 46:35.687
So, you
didn't say anything?

46:35.720 --> 46:37.088
No.

46:37.122 --> 46:40.192
Besides, I don't think
that's the main problem here.

46:40.226 --> 46:41.092
Okay.

46:42.560 --> 46:43.428
You're right.

46:45.231 --> 46:46.798
I'm going to see
if I can find him.

46:46.831 --> 46:48.234
That's a good idea.

46:48.267 --> 46:49.701
He's not thinking clearly.

46:50.702 --> 46:51.937
He really needs some help,

46:51.970 --> 46:54.472
and I'm going to do my
best to get him some.

46:56.107 --> 46:57.575
I'll be back as soon as I can.

50:09.368 --> 50:11.035
Thank you. Nice beer.

50:13.104 --> 50:14.639
Very good. Yeah.

50:15.441 --> 50:17.276
I don't remember.

50:24.450 --> 50:26.885
Don't have enough
steak knives at home?

50:26.918 --> 50:27.785
No.

50:27.819 --> 50:29.155
Wow, what happened to you?

50:29.188 --> 50:30.688
Looks like you got in a fight.

50:30.722 --> 50:31.323
Something like that.

50:31.357 --> 50:32.224
Kinda looks like you lost too.

50:32.258 --> 50:34.226
I'm gonna have to ask
you for that knife back.

50:34.260 --> 50:35.827
Just leave me the fuck alone!

50:35.860 --> 50:37.996
Wait! Gimme that
knife and get out!

50:44.470 --> 50:45.803
Open the door!

50:50.209 --> 50:52.076
Sir, you
need to open the door.

50:54.146 --> 50:57.081
I can't fucking believe this!

50:58.384 --> 51:00.219
Open
the goddamn door!

51:12.231 --> 51:13.865
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

51:15.767 --> 51:17.403
You are not killing
yourself in my restaurant!

51:23.309 --> 51:27.479
Why can't I just
be fucking left alone?

51:27.513 --> 51:29.381
I don't know what kinda
problems you have, buddy,

51:29.415 --> 51:31.283
but you don't need
to bring them here.

51:31.317 --> 51:33.252
Mom, call the police.

51:34.886 --> 51:36.821
Hi, yes, there's
a man threatening us

51:36.854 --> 51:38.756
and trying to steal
from our restaurant.

51:40.526 --> 51:41.427
Ow!

51:41.460 --> 51:43.429
Shit!

51:46.165 --> 51:47.433
Hey, come back here!

53:16.488 --> 53:19.924
Hey, Mark, it looks
like our new apartment

53:19.957 --> 53:20.825
will take pets.

53:21.993 --> 53:23.828
So we can go home
and get Russell now.

53:24.962 --> 53:25.930
Really?

53:25.963 --> 53:27.232
Yes, let's go.

53:29.134 --> 53:29.967
- Come on.
- Okay.

53:39.445 --> 53:40.446
I'm sorry.

54:20.686 --> 54:24.256
When we get there,
I have a few things

54:24.289 --> 54:26.558
to grab and then I'll
talk to your father

54:26.592 --> 54:28.092
about getting Russell, okay?

54:29.093 --> 54:30.295
Okay.

54:30.329 --> 54:31.330
Sounds good.

54:51.717 --> 54:52.584
Oh oh.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.120
Oh oh.

55:02.728 --> 55:03.928
Oh.

56:02.421 --> 56:05.224
You need to stay in
the car when we get home.

56:05.257 --> 56:06.057
Okay?

56:08.427 --> 56:09.428
All right.

56:15.167 --> 56:16.535
Don't get out of the car.

58:06.645 --> 58:09.147
We have no hope without God.

58:11.249 --> 58:14.820
Our perspectives on ourselves,

58:14.853 --> 58:17.656
on reality, on love

58:18.724 --> 58:19.825
are all skewed.

58:21.393 --> 58:23.395
Our perspectives are skewed

58:23.428 --> 58:26.164
by our fallen, human nature.

58:27.332 --> 58:29.334
But we're not left
to our fallen nature.

58:30.802 --> 58:34.640
God gives us the hope and
the guidance that we need.

58:34.673 --> 58:36.608
He has provided
us with the truth

58:37.709 --> 58:39.177
through his son Jesus

58:41.279 --> 58:42.280
and through his Word.

58:47.285 --> 58:48.754
If left to our own devices,

58:49.721 --> 58:51.556
if we ignore God's truth,

58:51.590 --> 58:55.594
we will always end in
failure and tragedy.

58:57.963 --> 59:01.833
But no matter what
tragedy we may experience,

59:02.834 --> 59:07.272
no matter how much we or
those around us may fail,

59:07.305 --> 59:08.473
God will not abandon us.

59:11.243 --> 59:13.745
We simply have to trust him

59:14.980 --> 59:16.715
and listen to his voice.

59:18.884 --> 59:19.918
For God is the one who made us,

59:19.951 --> 59:24.256
so naturally he is the only
one who knows what's best.

59:27.325 --> 59:32.197
Frequently, we turn to
our own wisdom to save us,

59:33.532 --> 59:35.600
but our wisdom is not wise.

59:37.035 --> 59:39.304
Even though we think
that we know ourselves,

59:39.337 --> 59:42.507
we think that we know
what's best for ourselves,

59:44.042 --> 59:45.377
we haven't got a clue.

59:46.912 --> 59:49.347
We are easily deceived.

59:51.349 --> 59:55.253
Now, the prophet Jeremiah
knew this very well.

59:55.287 --> 59:58.290
As he said, in 17:9,

59:59.491 --> 01:00:02.360
"The heart is deceitful
above all things,

01:00:03.528 --> 01:00:04.763
and desperately wicked.

01:00:06.898 --> 01:00:07.766
Who can know it?"

01:00:42.868 --> 01:00:43.668
Hello?

01:00:44.603 --> 01:00:45.537
Hi, Mark.

01:00:46.705 --> 01:00:47.539
Mom?

01:00:49.808 --> 01:00:52.043
I thought you were unconscious.

01:00:52.077 --> 01:00:52.911
I was.

01:00:52.944 --> 01:00:55.280
I'm actually okay now.

01:00:57.082 --> 01:00:59.651
I was in a car accident.

01:00:59.684 --> 01:01:01.787
The light turned
red really quickly

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.755
and I was going
too fast to stop.

01:01:04.422 --> 01:01:06.057
I'm glad to hear you're awake.

01:01:06.091 --> 01:01:09.861
Yes, and there's
no permanent damage.

01:01:09.895 --> 01:01:12.664
I have a few broken bones
and scrapes and bruises,

01:01:12.697 --> 01:01:14.432
but it could have
been a lot worse.

01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:15.300
Thank God.

01:01:16.101 --> 01:01:17.335
That's good.

01:01:18.137 --> 01:01:19.437
How are you?

01:01:20.605 --> 01:01:21.740
You sound okay.

01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.843
I was really concerned.

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:28.647
Mark?

01:01:30.448 --> 01:01:31.349
Are you okay?

01:01:33.752 --> 01:01:34.986
Not really.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.321
What's going on?

01:01:38.523 --> 01:01:40.725
I don't really
wanna talk about it.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.494
But...

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:46.398
I'm glad to hear that you're
doing all right, though.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.867
Can you
come and see me?

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:51.102
I'll be here overnight.

01:01:51.137 --> 01:01:52.470
I wanna see you.

01:01:55.907 --> 01:01:57.843
I don't think I'm
gonna make it in.

01:01:57.876 --> 01:01:59.110
Please, Mark.

01:01:59.145 --> 01:02:00.745
I'd really like you to come.

01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:04.583
I'm sorry, I just can't.

01:02:04.616 --> 01:02:07.052
What is
going on, Mark?

01:02:07.085 --> 01:02:09.721
I'm afraid of what
you're going to do.

01:02:09.754 --> 01:02:10.555
I have to go.

01:02:14.526 --> 01:02:15.493
I love you.

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:16.628
I love you!

01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:19.998
Don't go, Mark.

01:02:20.031 --> 01:02:22.400
Come and see me, please.

01:02:22.434 --> 01:02:23.501
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:02:24.836 --> 01:02:27.606
Mark?

01:02:27.639 --> 01:02:28.506
Mark?

01:02:35.046 --> 01:02:36.681
You've had a rough day.

01:02:38.516 --> 01:02:39.618
Let me help you.

01:02:39.651 --> 01:02:42.154
I'll get you some bandages and
liniments if you follow me.

01:02:42.188 --> 01:02:43.054
No.

01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:46.458
Thank you.

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.394
Okay.

01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:50.896
I'll bring them out here.

01:02:50.929 --> 01:02:51.963
No, please, look...

01:02:54.466 --> 01:02:55.533
I don't need anything.

01:02:56.968 --> 01:02:58.069
Are you sure?

01:02:59.471 --> 01:03:01.207
You look like you
could use some help.

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:08.113
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:03:09.814 --> 01:03:11.150
I'll be on my way.

01:03:14.719 --> 01:03:18.657
Hey, hey, hey.

01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:19.557
It's okay.

01:03:23.028 --> 01:03:24.462
May I ask what happened?

01:03:25.997 --> 01:03:26.998
I had an accident.

01:03:31.237 --> 01:03:32.204
Couple of accidents.

01:03:32.238 --> 01:03:33.505
Were they accidents?

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.574
More or less.

01:03:39.577 --> 01:03:41.180
You were trying
to kill yourself.

01:03:48.254 --> 01:03:49.188
Unsuccessfully.

01:03:50.588 --> 01:03:52.524
Sometimes it's good
to be unsuccessful then.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:55.194
I'm not so sure.

01:03:59.064 --> 01:04:01.533
I'd be in a lot less pain
if I were successful.

01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:05.237
Perhaps but you would
also be leaving behind

01:04:05.271 --> 01:04:08.473
all the wonder and awe
that life provides.

01:04:09.674 --> 01:04:12.610
Life does not provide
me with those things.

01:04:12.644 --> 01:04:14.045
Maybe you just don't
know how to see them?

01:04:14.079 --> 01:04:15.480
Or maybe they don't exist!

01:04:17.749 --> 01:04:20.652
Maybe they're purely
psychological inventions

01:04:20.685 --> 01:04:24.290
that act as buffers against
a meaningless existence.

01:04:24.323 --> 01:04:26.091
Does existence
require meaning?

01:04:29.295 --> 01:04:33.732
Maybe this desire for meaning

01:04:33.765 --> 01:04:34.933
leads to suffering.

01:04:36.101 --> 01:04:38.170
And that suffering
can be reduced

01:04:39.637 --> 01:04:41.706
when we realize the
truth of impermanence.

01:04:48.113 --> 01:04:49.047
Oh yes.

01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:52.050
Impermanence.

01:04:53.952 --> 01:04:55.920
All experiences are temporary.

01:04:58.923 --> 01:05:01.826
But that means that
happiness and contentment

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.061
are also temporary,

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.797
along with every
other experience.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:10.835
True, but the
concept of impermanence

01:05:12.338 --> 01:05:16.641
is more about not
identifying yourself

01:05:16.674 --> 01:05:19.644
with how you feel,

01:05:19.677 --> 01:05:22.547
or your past, or any
permanent conception of self.

01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:28.920
We are not the
darkness we experience

01:05:28.953 --> 01:05:30.289
or what we've been labeled.

01:05:33.259 --> 01:05:36.594
The past does not
determine who we are.

01:05:39.231 --> 01:05:40.899
There is a way to
move beyond it,

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.869
to really live in
the present moment.

01:05:46.372 --> 01:05:48.573
The present affords
me nothing but misery.

01:06:01.853 --> 01:06:04.989
May be wise to seek
the help of a therapist.

01:06:05.023 --> 01:06:08.126
I personally know a great one.

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.962
She's very thorough, the
deepest thinker I know.

01:06:10.995 --> 01:06:12.797
You'd probably get
along well with.

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:15.867
Let me grab you her card

01:06:16.935 --> 01:06:18.069
and uh...

01:06:19.171 --> 01:06:20.705
and some water.

01:06:20.738 --> 01:06:21.606
Huh?

01:06:23.409 --> 01:06:24.343
I'll be right back.

01:07:22.368 --> 01:07:23.469
Thank you.

01:07:23.502 --> 01:07:24.836
The sermon was
wonderful, thank you.

01:07:24.869 --> 01:07:25.803
Yeah.

01:07:25.837 --> 01:07:29.674
Okay.

01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:33.445
Well, what do you think?

01:07:33.479 --> 01:07:35.079
I thought it was nice.

01:07:35.113 --> 01:07:36.448
I'd like to keep going.

01:07:36.482 --> 01:07:37.782
You liked it?

01:07:37.815 --> 01:07:40.319
Did you agree with
what he was saying?

01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:42.787
Yes, well, maybe
not everything,

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.456
but I thought it
was a nice sermon,

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:47.058
and what Harold said
really made sense.

01:07:47.091 --> 01:07:47.692
Who's Harold?

01:07:47.725 --> 01:07:49.861
That's the name of the pastor.

01:07:49.894 --> 01:07:51.497
Oh.

01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:53.798
Yeah, it didn't really
make sense to me.

01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:54.466
Oh really?

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.700
What do you mean?

01:07:56.834 --> 01:07:58.470
I didn't like
what Jeremiah said.

01:07:58.504 --> 01:08:01.973
You know, about the heart
being deceitful and wicked.

01:08:03.142 --> 01:08:05.009
Well, Mark, I think
it's better to rely

01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:07.745
on God's truth than
to rely on ourselves.

01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:10.815
That was the point he
was trying to make.

01:08:10.848 --> 01:08:12.083
I know.

01:08:12.116 --> 01:08:13.751
I just didn't like it.

01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:16.754
Well, we're going to
keep coming here, Mark.

01:08:16.787 --> 01:08:19.457
So, you better learn to like it.

01:08:33.404 --> 01:08:34.206
Fuck!

01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:10.908
Is it going up?

01:09:12.042 --> 01:09:12.877
Yeah.

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:13.911
Okay, good.

01:09:16.348 --> 01:09:17.216
Which floor?

01:09:17.249 --> 01:09:18.450
Oh, 10, thanks!

01:09:26.191 --> 01:09:31.196
You wanna pet him?

01:09:48.413 --> 01:09:49.846
Have a great day!

01:12:44.723 --> 01:12:46.758
Oh shit!

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:48.760
Oh, hey!

01:12:48.794 --> 01:12:49.761
Are you okay, man?

01:12:49.795 --> 01:12:52.498
Hey, hey.

01:12:52.531 --> 01:12:54.132
Oh God!

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.767
What happened to you?

01:12:55.801 --> 01:12:57.402
You got a window?

01:12:59.137 --> 01:13:00.806
Did you fall out
of a helicopter?

01:13:00.839 --> 01:13:01.607
Oh God.

01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:15.787
Let me call an
ambulance, all right?

01:13:15.821 --> 01:13:20.659
You see, stay right there.

01:13:20.692 --> 01:13:21.560
Hello?

01:13:24.463 --> 01:13:25.597
I'm gonna call you

01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:27.165
Hey, hey, come on.

01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:32.069
Come on, come on.

01:13:32.103 --> 01:13:33.171
You okay?

01:13:34.172 --> 01:13:34.806
Hey, hey.

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:36.708
Hey, look at me, hey.

01:13:36.742 --> 01:13:38.210
Please.

01:13:39.578 --> 01:13:41.078
I just need it to be over.

01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:42.614
Okay.

01:13:42.648 --> 01:13:45.150
Listen, I don't know
what happened to you.

01:13:45.183 --> 01:13:47.319
We're gonna call
an ambulance, okay?

01:13:48.186 --> 01:13:48.854
Okay.

01:13:48.887 --> 01:13:50.188
Just come with me.

01:13:52.858 --> 01:13:54.359
There we go.

01:13:54.393 --> 01:13:55.761
There you go, buddy.

01:13:55.794 --> 01:13:56.828
All right.

01:13:56.862 --> 01:13:58.363
Come on.

01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.466
Oh God, hold on.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:02.334
Okay.

01:14:03.602 --> 01:14:04.870
Yes.

01:14:06.338 --> 01:14:08.240
Yeah, we need an ambulance.

01:14:08.907 --> 01:14:10.107
Oh God.

01:14:10.142 --> 01:14:11.176
Okay, okay.

01:14:11.209 --> 01:14:11.877
You okay?

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:12.844
Wait.

01:14:12.878 --> 01:14:13.879
It's all right.

01:14:13.912 --> 01:14:15.147
Come on.

01:14:25.757 --> 01:14:28.594
Oh.

01:14:28.627 --> 01:14:29.595
Hey babe.

01:14:29.628 --> 01:14:30.629
Did you find Mark?

01:14:31.663 --> 01:14:32.598
No.

01:14:32.631 --> 01:14:34.232
I couldn't turn him up anywhere.

01:14:34.266 --> 01:14:36.201
His place had caught on fire.

01:14:36.234 --> 01:14:38.337
They're still
cleaning up the mess.

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:40.339
Wow, oh my God.

01:14:40.372 --> 01:14:42.140
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.

01:14:42.174 --> 01:14:44.343
I think he tried to
burn it down himself.

01:14:44.376 --> 01:14:46.378
It honestly
wouldn't surprise me.

01:14:47.713 --> 01:14:49.381
Poor Mark.

01:14:49.414 --> 01:14:50.682
I know.

01:14:50.716 --> 01:14:51.917
I'm actually almost back.

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:53.185
Okay.

01:14:53.919 --> 01:14:56.922
Did you leave the door open?

01:14:56.955 --> 01:14:57.789
The door?

01:14:58.724 --> 01:14:59.658
Yes, to the balcony.

01:14:59.691 --> 01:15:00.926
Did you open it?

01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:01.927
Nope.

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.395
That's odd. It's open.

01:15:04.396 --> 01:15:05.897
Well, I didn't open it.

01:15:05.931 --> 01:15:06.632
Maybe you just forgot.

01:15:06.665 --> 01:15:09.368
No, I did not
open it and forget.

01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:11.637
Okay. Well, maybe I did it.

01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:12.537
I don't remember.

01:15:14.539 --> 01:15:15.407
Hmm.

01:15:16.541 --> 01:15:18.276
I just had this bizarre thought.

01:15:20.445 --> 01:15:21.780
Oh well, it doesn't matter.

01:15:21.813 --> 01:15:22.681
I'll let you go.

01:15:23.715 --> 01:15:24.516
Okay.

01:15:24.549 --> 01:15:25.550
I'll see you soon.

01:15:49.574 --> 01:15:51.910
The ambulance
should be here soon.

01:15:58.316 --> 01:16:00.686
Where are you going?

01:16:00.719 --> 01:16:01.453
I'm leaving.

01:16:01.486 --> 01:16:03.288
No, no, man.

01:16:03.321 --> 01:16:04.289
Hey, we can help!

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:12.264
Leave me alone.

01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:17.669
I'm sick and tired of
people getting in my way.

01:16:20.272 --> 01:16:22.407
I was just trying to help.

01:16:25.744 --> 01:16:27.245
I don't want

01:16:28.013 --> 01:16:29.481
your fucking help!

01:16:40.826 --> 01:16:43.729
Holy shit.

01:17:04.516 --> 01:17:06.051
Holy shit, Mark!

01:17:06.084 --> 01:17:07.552
Are you okay?

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.788
What do you think?

01:17:09.821 --> 01:17:11.556
You don't look okay!

01:17:12.858 --> 01:17:14.392
That's because I'm not.

01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:15.494
Holy shit, Mark!

01:17:15.527 --> 01:17:17.796
Yeah, you said that already.

01:17:17.829 --> 01:17:22.667
Well, what happened?

01:17:22.701 --> 01:17:26.538
I unsuccessfully used
Alyssa's balcon... balcony

01:17:26.571 --> 01:17:29.307
as an escape from
the misery of life.

01:17:29.341 --> 01:17:30.408
Holy shit!

01:17:31.244 --> 01:17:32.811
We have to get you
to the hospital.

01:17:33.478 --> 01:17:35.647
That is not where I wanna be.

01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:37.082
I don't care. You're going.

01:17:40.352 --> 01:17:42.654
Fucking fantastic.

01:17:42.687 --> 01:17:44.055
Oh, come on, man.

01:17:44.089 --> 01:17:45.457
Help me out.

01:17:49.861 --> 01:17:52.063
I hate the hospital.

01:17:52.097 --> 01:17:53.331
I don't wanna go.

01:17:53.365 --> 01:17:54.065
That's not an option.

01:17:54.099 --> 01:17:55.700
Yeah, sure it is.

01:17:56.568 --> 01:17:57.402
It isn't.

01:18:18.623 --> 01:18:19.658
You know, Mark,

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.361
I've known Alyssa a
lot longer than you.

01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:27.966
She told me how you and her
weren't doing so well one night

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:30.368
and I tried to comfort her.

01:18:30.402 --> 01:18:31.570
Oh, by fucking her?

01:18:31.603 --> 01:18:33.405
It's not worth
killing yourself over.

01:18:35.174 --> 01:18:36.708
That's not why.

01:18:36.741 --> 01:18:37.609
Then why?

01:18:38.543 --> 01:18:40.846
I tried explaining it to you.

01:18:44.482 --> 01:18:46.518
Life has no meaning.

01:18:49.921 --> 01:18:52.757
And I don't derive
value from anything.

01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:00.932
I put all my faith
into something

01:19:00.966 --> 01:19:03.668
that I now realize is
completely false.

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:13.879
Everything that I thought
gave life meaning is gone.

01:19:20.785 --> 01:19:21.920
And now I have nothing.

01:20:08.733 --> 01:20:10.101
How are you feeling?

01:20:13.004 --> 01:20:16.574
I'm in pain, but
it's manageable.

01:20:17.509 --> 01:20:19.211
I'm glad to hear that.

01:20:19.245 --> 01:20:20.578
My name is Lisa.

01:20:20.612 --> 01:20:22.181
I'm the resident
social worker here.

01:20:26.584 --> 01:20:27.320
You'll be going in for surgery

01:20:27.353 --> 01:20:29.821
as soon as there's
an OR available.

01:20:29.854 --> 01:20:32.757
The doctor believes you may
have some internal bleeding

01:20:32.791 --> 01:20:34.193
due to some fractured ribs.

01:20:35.328 --> 01:20:38.563
We're a little under-staffed
and full of patients today,

01:20:38.596 --> 01:20:40.532
but they'll get you in
as soon as possible.

01:20:42.033 --> 01:20:44.502
In the meantime, I'm going
to ask you a few questions

01:20:44.536 --> 01:20:47.005
to help determine why
you're in here today, okay?

01:20:48.606 --> 01:20:49.541
Well, if you have to.

01:20:51.076 --> 01:20:52.077
Not going anywhere.

01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:54.946
I do.

01:20:56.614 --> 01:20:59.584
Andrew said he believes you
tried to kill yourself today.

01:20:59.617 --> 01:21:01.253
It looks like he was correct?

01:21:01.287 --> 01:21:02.487
Yes.

01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:06.891
Was this
your first attempt?

01:21:08.294 --> 01:21:09.527
More or less.

01:21:12.063 --> 01:21:13.898
Are you
on any medications?

01:21:16.067 --> 01:21:17.303
I was.

01:21:17.336 --> 01:21:18.204
For depression?

01:21:20.638 --> 01:21:22.174
Are you seeing a therapist?

01:21:23.908 --> 01:21:24.709
I was.

01:21:25.777 --> 01:21:27.746
But I stopped a while back.

01:21:27.779 --> 01:21:29.215
You stopped taking
your medication

01:21:29.248 --> 01:21:32.184
and you stopped
seeing your therapist?

01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:33.852
My problems were existential,

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.554
not medical.

01:21:37.789 --> 01:21:39.691
Sometimes medication
can soften the burden

01:21:39.724 --> 01:21:41.659
of our existential crises.

01:21:42.727 --> 01:21:46.332
And therapy can also be
quite helpful in that regard.

01:21:46.365 --> 01:21:47.233
Well, it wasn't.

01:21:48.367 --> 01:21:49.201
Why not?

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:54.539
Because I couldn't afford
a therapist of my choosing.

01:21:55.607 --> 01:21:57.842
I had to see a
Christian therapist

01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:58.943
that my mom paid for.

01:22:00.011 --> 01:22:00.912
And you're not religious?

01:22:00.945 --> 01:22:01.746
Are you?

01:22:03.215 --> 01:22:04.682
My personal beliefs
are unimportant right now.

01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:06.684
Oh, they're
incredibly important.

01:22:07.486 --> 01:22:09.821
They motivate you to
do what you're doing.

01:22:14.692 --> 01:22:16.561
I'm not religious.

01:22:19.697 --> 01:22:20.565
Well.

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:23.101
I was.

01:22:24.702 --> 01:22:25.637
But not anymore?

01:22:27.105 --> 01:22:29.841
There was too much in
Christianity that bothered me.

01:22:31.243 --> 01:22:33.011
I couldn't ignore
all of its problems.

01:22:33.044 --> 01:22:34.579
What problems?

01:22:35.847 --> 01:22:39.851
Poorly structured
values, self-deceit.

01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:45.157
The acceptance of rather
questionable ideals

01:22:45.191 --> 01:22:47.159
and inward torment
labeled as holy.

01:22:48.394 --> 01:22:49.295
Inward torment?

01:22:50.162 --> 01:22:50.995
Sure.

01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:53.765
The self-loathing.

01:22:55.733 --> 01:22:57.735
The introverted
cruelty developed

01:22:57.769 --> 01:22:59.938
through a tradition
of self-shaming.

01:23:03.007 --> 01:23:05.377
At the very core of
Christianity is the belief

01:23:05.411 --> 01:23:09.647
that human beings are such
unworthy, vile creatures

01:23:09.681 --> 01:23:12.117
that a blood sacrifice
of a god is the only way

01:23:12.151 --> 01:23:13.618
for them to become acceptable.

01:23:17.156 --> 01:23:19.258
And whoever doesn't believe that

01:23:19.291 --> 01:23:21.393
is doomed to an
eternity of agony.

01:23:21.427 --> 01:23:22.894
I... it's disgusting.

01:23:27.433 --> 01:23:31.102
I was forced into
religion as a child,

01:23:33.905 --> 01:23:37.742
but eventually I found a
belief in God did offer

01:23:37.775 --> 01:23:41.679
a kind of comfort that
didn't exist anywhere else.

01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:46.385
But that comfort
didn't last long.

01:23:48.487 --> 01:23:51.089
I began to realize
the belief in God

01:23:51.122 --> 01:23:52.924
didn't hold up to
logical scrutiny.

01:23:54.460 --> 01:23:56.162
It takes a lot of
fortitude to be objective

01:23:56.195 --> 01:23:57.695
about one's own beliefs.

01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:00.199
Not everyone can do that.

01:24:01.367 --> 01:24:03.067
I'm not sure it's
done me much good.

01:24:05.271 --> 01:24:08.274
I see the deception
inherent in faith,

01:24:10.942 --> 01:24:12.810
but logic only takes one so far.

01:24:14.812 --> 01:24:16.681
And faith has no equivalent.

01:24:18.816 --> 01:24:20.718
There isn't anything
to give life meaning.

01:24:22.820 --> 01:24:25.089
It obviously lacks
intrinsic value.

01:24:26.991 --> 01:24:30.762
And if a person loses
all value and meaning,

01:24:32.398 --> 01:24:34.065
and all their
relationships fail,

01:24:34.098 --> 01:24:35.700
and they have
nothing to turn to,

01:24:37.969 --> 01:24:39.103
then why should
they go on living

01:24:39.138 --> 01:24:40.439
in such a miserable state?

01:24:42.508 --> 01:24:44.742
Suicide is the most
logical outcome.

01:24:46.844 --> 01:24:48.447
What about creating
your own value?

01:24:49.481 --> 01:24:53.185
Life can be miserable and
relationships can fail,

01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:56.522
but it is possible to
live a meaningful life

01:24:56.555 --> 01:24:57.855
and to have value.

01:24:59.391 --> 01:25:02.228
You now have the opportunity
to build your own foundation

01:25:02.261 --> 01:25:04.762
and create your own values.

01:25:06.265 --> 01:25:07.832
Once you're able to do that,

01:25:07.865 --> 01:25:10.101
your perspective
on relationships

01:25:10.135 --> 01:25:12.137
and everything else
in life can change.

01:25:13.539 --> 01:25:15.507
You can have a will to
life that isn't dependent

01:25:15.541 --> 01:25:18.143
on anyone or anything
outside yourself.

01:25:20.145 --> 01:25:22.214
Unfortunately for
me, it doesn't matter.

01:25:25.217 --> 01:25:27.419
I've exhausted all my resources.

01:25:30.556 --> 01:25:33.525
And I don't think there's
any value to be found.

01:25:33.559 --> 01:25:35.527
I'm not talking
about discovering value

01:25:35.561 --> 01:25:37.162
as if it's hidden somewhere.

01:25:38.297 --> 01:25:39.998
I'm talking about
deciding what's worth

01:25:40.031 --> 01:25:42.334
spending your time on
and what brings you joy.

01:25:43.901 --> 01:25:45.170
This takes a lot of work.

01:25:46.372 --> 01:25:50.476
But in my experience, everyone
who actually sticks with it

01:25:50.509 --> 01:25:52.278
and gets the
assistance they need

01:25:52.311 --> 01:25:53.811
ends up coming out
of their depression

01:25:53.845 --> 01:25:57.048
and finding that life is
valuable and worth living.

01:25:58.850 --> 01:26:01.587
I just don't have the
capacity to hope for that.

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.155
Don't hope.

01:26:03.188 --> 01:26:05.190
Hope is a distraction.

01:26:05.224 --> 01:26:07.892
It leaves us waiting
for some magical escape

01:26:07.925 --> 01:26:09.794
or divine intervention.

01:26:11.062 --> 01:26:13.031
I'm talking about
taking your experiences

01:26:13.064 --> 01:26:14.233
and learning from them.

01:26:15.401 --> 01:26:16.834
You have to put in
conscious effort

01:26:16.868 --> 01:26:18.304
and do the practical
things that'll help you

01:26:18.337 --> 01:26:19.405
get through this time.

01:26:20.872 --> 01:26:21.973
Like what?

01:26:22.006 --> 01:26:25.444
Like medications,
talk therapy.

01:26:25.477 --> 01:26:26.911
There are
state-assisted programs

01:26:26.944 --> 01:26:28.580
that can help you with that.

01:26:28.614 --> 01:26:31.317
Also, meditation and exercising

01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:34.586
tremendously reduce depression
and improve wellbeing.

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:36.355
There are a number of
things that can help you

01:26:36.388 --> 01:26:37.955
get into a healthier mindset.

01:26:38.956 --> 01:26:40.259
Once you find the right balance,

01:26:40.292 --> 01:26:43.595
you can figure out what
really matters to you

01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:46.298
and create a meaningful
life for yourself.

01:26:47.899 --> 01:26:49.967
You don't have to rely on
anyone else's value structure.

01:26:51.002 --> 01:26:53.104
You can create your own values.

01:26:54.005 --> 01:26:55.240
You are capable of that.

01:26:59.977 --> 01:27:01.513
Sorry for the wait,
but it's time to see

01:27:01.547 --> 01:27:03.615
if we can get your
insides all fixed up.

01:27:14.926 --> 01:27:17.128
I could hear it in his voice.

01:27:17.162 --> 01:27:18.630
So could I.

01:27:18.664 --> 01:27:20.265
I knew what he was thinking.

01:27:26.572 --> 01:27:29.475
I still can't believe
he used my balcony.

01:27:31.008 --> 01:27:31.909
I just feel so awful.

01:27:31.943 --> 01:27:34.979
I wish there was something
I could have done.

01:27:35.012 --> 01:27:35.614
Me too.

01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:40.619
Do you know how long
the surgery will take?

01:27:44.323 --> 01:27:45.657
I'm sure it won't

01:27:45.691 --> 01:27:46.592
take too long.

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:49.261
He has a really great doctor.

01:27:49.294 --> 01:27:50.562
He should be just fine.

01:27:52.029 --> 01:27:53.064
I really hope so.

01:27:58.704 --> 01:28:00.037
He's all I have.

01:28:02.174 --> 01:28:05.042
I don't know what
I'd do without him.

01:28:09.314 --> 01:28:12.049
I really wish I could have
given him a better life.

01:28:14.051 --> 01:28:15.920
Maybe I forced too much on him,

01:28:17.054 --> 01:28:18.990
especially when he
lost his father.

01:28:21.058 --> 01:28:22.661
I didn't know what else to do.

01:28:25.997 --> 01:28:27.566
How did it get to this?

01:28:27.599 --> 01:28:30.067
You can't blame
yourself for any of this.

01:28:33.338 --> 01:28:34.406
I'm not so sure.

01:28:39.010 --> 01:28:43.282
I think I failed him
pretty miserably.

01:28:48.487 --> 01:28:49.655
You talked to him.

01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:52.257
What did he say?

01:28:54.226 --> 01:28:56.662
He went on about not
believing in anything,

01:28:57.696 --> 01:28:59.665
not finding meaning in life,

01:28:59.698 --> 01:29:01.467
saying it didn't have any value.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:03.235
He seemed pretty lost.

01:29:07.773 --> 01:29:11.210
I tried getting through to him

01:29:11.243 --> 01:29:13.110
and showing him the right way.

01:29:14.713 --> 01:29:18.250
And I've tried showing
him God's love.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:25.757
He never really seemed to
understand what that meant.

01:29:29.661 --> 01:29:32.297
He may need more time
in order to see that love.

01:29:33.565 --> 01:29:35.167
Whenever I tried
getting through to him,

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:37.402
he'd reject everything
I had to say.

01:29:41.139 --> 01:29:42.808
He insisted he
didn't need my help

01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:47.412
but he seemed to have
given up all hope.

01:29:55.554 --> 01:29:57.322
We have to have hope for Mark

01:29:58.690 --> 01:30:01.527
and trust that someday
he'll find the hope he needs

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.594
to carry on.
