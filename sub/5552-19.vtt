WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:03.963 --> 00:05.090
Oh, crud.

00:05.423 --> 00:08.510
<i>He killed my mother, Jim.
He had her murdered in front of me.</i>

00:08.718 --> 00:10.178
I am going to kill you.

00:10.762 --> 00:11.763
<i>I think I found something.</i>

00:11.930 --> 00:15.100
<i>The week of his murder, he was supposed to
meet a woman named Karen Jennings</i>

00:15.266 --> 00:17.060
<i>about something called Pinewood Farms.</i>

00:17.227 --> 00:20.647
<i>Pinewood Farms was a bioengineering
program at Wayne Enterprises.</i>

00:20.939 --> 00:22.232
<i>It started up again, didn't it?</i>

00:22.399 --> 00:24.275
<i>That's why my father came to see you
after all those years.</i>

00:24.442 --> 00:27.112
<i>Karen Jennings is gonna be dead
the minute she hits Blackgate Prison.</i>

00:27.278 --> 00:28.279
<i>That's why we're gonna break her out.</i>

00:28.613 --> 00:31.157
The man who contracted Matches Malone
to kill your parents

00:31.324 --> 00:32.617
called himself The Philosopher.

00:32.826 --> 00:35.578
And I'd be willing to bet that this
is the man who is behind Pinewood.

00:35.829 --> 00:37.831
<i>"Hugo Strange, The Philosopher."</i>

00:38.289 --> 00:39.457
He runs Arkham now.

00:39.666 --> 00:41.126
We brought someone back.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.546
Azrael!

00:44.963 --> 00:47.215
We actually did it.

01:03.648 --> 01:04.649
Rally to me.

01:04.816 --> 01:08.069
St. Dumas will deliver us.

01:10.739 --> 01:12.323
<i>St. Dumas will protect us.</i>

01:12.615 --> 01:14.075
Heathens!

01:14.242 --> 01:15.452
Idolaters!

01:15.618 --> 01:18.538
Spawn of Satan. Prepare to die.

01:20.373 --> 01:24.753
Don't, don't. No, don't. Please.
Sister, speak to me, please.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.379
Please, speak to me.

01:27.672 --> 01:30.759
Who are you? Huh? Who are you?

01:31.092 --> 01:33.845
Has there been any improvement
since he woke up yesterday?

01:34.095 --> 01:35.138
No.

01:35.805 --> 01:37.515
But he is wonderful, isn't he?

01:38.224 --> 01:44.272
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Strong as an ox, fast as a snake.

01:44.481 --> 01:45.857
And mad as a hatter.

01:48.526 --> 01:51.988
There's not much use bringing back
the dead if they come back crazy.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.573
Oh, he's not crazy.

01:54.199 --> 01:55.909
He just doesn't know who he is.

01:56.326 --> 01:59.370
His psyche can't reconcile
being brought back from the dead.

01:59.579 --> 02:02.624
<i>It's fractured,
grasping at fragmented memories.</i>

02:02.832 --> 02:07.045
The texts that he has written on the walls
are all verses from this book.

02:08.004 --> 02:10.423
<i>"The Will and Order of St. Dumas"?</i>

02:10.590 --> 02:14.928
The Galavan family is proudly descended
from 12th century crusading knights.

02:15.094 --> 02:17.013
This is their secret text.

02:17.222 --> 02:20.725
Evidently, our patient has memorized
the whole book.

02:20.934 --> 02:24.729
<i>His brain is struggling to rebuild
a coherent self.</i>

02:25.104 --> 02:28.691
- But he's using the wrong parts.
- So, what's the cure?

02:30.401 --> 02:31.861
Good question.

02:39.077 --> 02:40.662
What is it?

02:44.249 --> 02:45.375
Mr. Gordon.

02:47.335 --> 02:50.588
Professor Strange.
Sorry to drop by unexpected.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.549
Oh, not at all. Please, have a seat.

02:54.259 --> 02:56.094
To what do I owe the pleasure?

02:56.427 --> 02:58.638
I've been hired by a client
to look into something.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.765
- I was hoping you could help me with it.
- Of course.

03:01.474 --> 03:02.976
This is Karen Jennings.

03:04.102 --> 03:05.770
<i>She was murdered last night.</i>

03:06.980 --> 03:09.357
- Oh, how tragic.
- She was a test subject

03:09.858 --> 03:13.278
in an old Wayne Enterprises program
called Pinewood Farms.

03:13.736 --> 03:17.031
Before she passed, Karen mentioned
you were involved with the program.

03:18.157 --> 03:20.827
- That was a long time ago.
- Try and remember...

03:22.871 --> 03:23.997
If you can.

03:25.623 --> 03:29.460
Pinewood Farms was started by Thomas Wayne
in an attempt to cure

03:29.669 --> 03:32.255
humanity's greatest ailments
on the genetic level.

03:32.630 --> 03:37.051
- Old age, disease, even death.
- But that's not what happened, is it?

03:37.969 --> 03:42.724
Karen said the program tried to play God,
and you ended up creating monsters.

03:42.974 --> 03:44.517
I was just a researcher,

03:44.976 --> 03:47.353
with no knowledge of that
until it was too late.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.856
A man of your skill and expertise,
a lowly researcher?

03:50.648 --> 03:52.066
I find that hard to believe.

03:52.692 --> 03:53.818
But it's true.

03:54.444 --> 03:58.364
Mr. Wayne excelled at compartmentalizing
every aspect of his life.

03:58.615 --> 04:01.868
Within Pinewood, the left hand often
didn't know what the right was doing.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.745
He lied to us all.

04:04.078 --> 04:05.955
Not many people
would see you as the victim here.

04:06.247 --> 04:09.834
I was one of the ones who forced
Thomas Wayne to shut down the program.

04:10.209 --> 04:14.172
But by then, so many people had been hurt.

04:15.673 --> 04:17.258
- I have a theory.
- Hmm?

04:18.927 --> 04:20.762
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.681
I believe you've restarted the program.

04:24.515 --> 04:27.518
- And I would like to know--
- Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?

04:28.019 --> 04:29.020
Excuse me?

04:29.771 --> 04:32.315
This whole city
has turned its back on you,

04:32.732 --> 04:37.278
despite you risking your life to save it
over and over again.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.822
I'm not here
for a therapy session, Professor.

04:39.989 --> 04:41.658
No, it's more like an interrogation

04:42.742 --> 04:45.036
by a man who is no longer
a police officer,

04:45.370 --> 04:48.414
who no longer has the right
to demand answers.

04:48.581 --> 04:51.709
The only reason you're sitting
in that chair is because I allow it.

04:51.876 --> 04:58.132
So let me ask you, why are you here?

05:00.176 --> 05:02.053
Like I said, I have a client.

05:02.762 --> 05:04.389
Bruce Wayne, I suppose.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.891
<i>So it's a job.</i>

05:07.225 --> 05:10.353
You're here to pay the rent? Surely not.

05:12.063 --> 05:14.482
<i>All that's happened to you,
this last year...</i>

05:14.899 --> 05:17.777
Hero cop found guilty of murder,

05:18.111 --> 05:22.573
sentenced unjustly to Blackgate,
and now you returned to what?

05:24.325 --> 05:25.576
You've lost everything.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.913
You're trying to make up
for the sins of your past

05:29.080 --> 05:31.290
<i>and you believe
that this case will somehow</i>

05:31.457 --> 05:33.668
bring about your own personal redemption.

05:33.918 --> 05:36.295
- No.
- You're not doing this for your client.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.589
- You're doing this for yourself.
- You're wrong.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.219
You just exhibited several tells.

05:43.845 --> 05:45.888
Facial tics, expressions,
and eye movements

05:46.097 --> 05:50.476
that people involuntarily
betray themselves with when they lie.

05:52.520 --> 05:56.107
- Let's talk about Victor Fries.
- Victor Fries is dead, Mr. Gordon.

05:56.441 --> 05:57.442
Really?

05:57.692 --> 05:58.943
I saw him last night.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.612
That's impossible.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.206
This is a court order signed
by District Attorney Dent

06:12.457 --> 06:14.167
<i>to exhume Fries' body.</i>

06:16.002 --> 06:17.003
Where's it buried?

06:18.963 --> 06:20.715
He was cremated.

06:22.842 --> 06:23.885
Thank you.

06:24.761 --> 06:25.887
For what?

06:27.680 --> 06:29.015
I can read tells, too.

06:29.891 --> 06:33.352
<i>You're lying. I needed to be sure
you were behind all this.</i>

06:34.062 --> 06:35.063
And now I am.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.002
Don't lie! I heard you!

07:00.046 --> 07:02.882
- Please... Don't.
- Please do.

07:03.341 --> 07:05.009
Squeeze the life from him. Kill him.

07:05.176 --> 07:07.011
- Kill him now.
- Are you two fighting again?

07:07.303 --> 07:11.599
- He called me fat.
- I didn't do anything, it wasn't me.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.142
It was Lucy.

07:14.227 --> 07:15.686
The fifth personality again.

07:15.895 --> 07:18.606
Such a nasty attitude.
See, this gets complicated.

07:19.023 --> 07:22.819
See, Lucy is in his head 'cause Rudy has
what's called multiple personality--

07:23.111 --> 07:24.153
In his head?

07:24.862 --> 07:27.198
- Then I'll pull her out.
- No, no, no.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.408
- She's a ghost.
- A ghost?

07:29.659 --> 07:30.660
Yes.

07:30.868 --> 07:33.704
And she makes Rudy say things
that he doesn't wanna say.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.042
I can see her.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.710
Lucy,

07:40.545 --> 07:44.173
you've got some nerves,

07:44.340 --> 07:46.592
making old Rudy say things like that.

07:48.010 --> 07:52.014
You know that Helzinger is not fat.

07:52.723 --> 07:57.186
In fact, you said
that Helzinger was handsome.

08:00.273 --> 08:02.108
Don't you shove me.

08:03.151 --> 08:05.611
Oh! She slapped me.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.281
Now I'll tell you something, Lucy.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.575
You will leave Rudy alone

08:10.908 --> 08:15.955
and if you come back here again,
you'll have to deal with me.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.042
Thank you, Lucy.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.464
She really made you say all that?

08:28.050 --> 08:29.051
Yeah.

08:30.511 --> 08:31.762
Wasn't me.

08:33.014 --> 08:35.183
- Sorry.
- Hey!

08:36.434 --> 08:38.895
- Lucy thinks I'm handsome?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.479
Isn't that right...

08:42.106 --> 08:43.774
What is he doing here?

08:45.401 --> 08:46.611
Hello, Jimmy.

08:47.278 --> 08:49.947
- Go to hell, Ed.
- You've already put me there. Here.

08:51.616 --> 08:54.118
But not for long, my friend.
I'll find my way out.

08:54.327 --> 08:57.121
'Cause this place is just one big puzzle,
and puzzles are my forte.

08:57.914 --> 08:59.540
Nobody beats me.

09:02.627 --> 09:05.254
I did. See you never, Ed.

09:06.756 --> 09:08.299
That's what you think.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.927
I have
a feeling he is going to be

09:11.093 --> 09:12.511
more than a simple nuisance.

09:12.762 --> 09:15.806
Not the type to be bribed,
nor distracted easily.

09:16.015 --> 09:18.851
- Indeed. If only we...
- Very interesting.

09:20.019 --> 09:22.063
What has no hands,
but might knock on your door

09:22.271 --> 09:23.606
and you better open up if it does?

09:23.898 --> 09:26.817
Mr. Gordon's continued interference
threatens to slow us down

09:27.109 --> 09:28.986
when we're about to reach
our finest moment.

09:29.195 --> 09:30.446
He'll do more than that.

09:31.989 --> 09:32.990
Mr. Nygma.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.744
Eavesdropping is rude and unwise.

09:37.078 --> 09:39.580
Eavesdropping implies intent,
and I mostly...

09:40.081 --> 09:42.667
- Accidentally overheard.
- Overheard what?

09:43.542 --> 09:46.921
Jim Gordon, the word nuisance.
Sounds familiar.

09:48.130 --> 09:51.092
Probably has something to do with your
releasing Penguin and Gordon's ex-fiancée.

09:52.051 --> 09:53.344
Probably.

09:53.552 --> 09:56.430
I can help you take him down.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.683
I know everything about Jim Gordon.

09:59.058 --> 10:01.602
If you let me out of here we could
probably just sit down in your office--

10:01.811 --> 10:04.897
Mr. Nygma, you can't help me.
I'm here to help you.

10:05.189 --> 10:07.692
Those are the roles that were defined
for the two of us.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.653
- Now, there's another pressing matter.
- No, listen, I...

10:12.238 --> 10:13.572
I can manipulate people.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.825
I did it to Gordon once,
and I can do it again.

10:16.033 --> 10:18.786
See, people's brains are just a mystery.

10:19.370 --> 10:20.830
And once you figure it out...

10:21.580 --> 10:23.082
Look, Helzinger.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.544
Can't stand criticism
because of an overbearing mother.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.630
Wants love and approval.
Gets mad when he doesn't get it.

10:29.797 --> 10:30.881
So I give it.

10:31.549 --> 10:33.134
Oh, thank you.

10:34.051 --> 10:38.180
Sharon. Kleptomaniacal due to
obsessive compulsive disorder.

10:41.726 --> 10:44.228
Just give her something to concentrate on.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.688
And--

10:46.230 --> 10:48.441
And Norton, serious boundary issues.

10:49.984 --> 10:52.236
Prone to torture, violence
and cannibalism.

10:52.445 --> 10:54.905
Unless he thinks he's your friend.

10:55.573 --> 10:56.824
- For me?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.747
My point is, everyone has a story.

11:03.164 --> 11:04.457
<i>And they just wanna be listened to.</i>

11:04.874 --> 11:06.917
My God. I should be the shrink.

11:07.335 --> 11:08.586
What did you say?

11:09.170 --> 11:10.338
I'm sorry. Was that too far?

11:10.755 --> 11:12.298
Everybody has a story.

11:13.007 --> 11:16.927
That's it. Mr. Nygma,
you've actually been very helpful.

11:27.063 --> 11:31.817
I have it, Peabody.
I have the cure for our prized patient.

11:32.485 --> 11:34.528
- Do tell.
- What is an identity?

11:35.112 --> 11:36.989
What is a sense of self?

11:37.198 --> 11:40.785
It is a story
that we humans tell ourselves.

11:40.993 --> 11:44.538
We have got to give him
a great heroic story.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.084
We need to give him
a good heroic dose of Thorazine.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.794
But you're the boss.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.048
Perfect. Perfect.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.300
Sir? Sir.

11:57.093 --> 11:59.553
Stop! He's dangerous.

12:08.646 --> 12:10.189
Hello?

12:11.315 --> 12:12.608
Hello?

12:28.457 --> 12:32.503
I need all available security
to the reanimation lab now.

12:32.711 --> 12:35.798
No! Do not let them in. Do not interfere.

12:39.844 --> 12:41.137
My son.

12:41.554 --> 12:43.180
My son, please stop.

12:43.472 --> 12:47.435
Why have you forsaken me?
Have you forgotten the code?

12:51.063 --> 12:52.565
Who are you?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.403
My poor, dear, son.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.655
Who do you think I am?

13:00.614 --> 13:01.866
Your son?

13:02.741 --> 13:04.034
You're my father?

13:05.035 --> 13:06.287
Who else?

13:07.163 --> 13:10.958
Don't you feel a father's love
when I look into your eyes?

13:11.959 --> 13:13.252
Where am I?

13:13.461 --> 13:16.964
What is happening to me?
What happened to me?

13:17.131 --> 13:18.215
Shh. Shh.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.050
Why don't I know my name?

13:20.551 --> 13:21.719
My son.

13:24.638 --> 13:25.890
Calm your heart.

13:26.182 --> 13:30.019
Demons took you to the Land of Death
and bewitched your soul.

13:30.186 --> 13:34.899
But I brought you back to life.
You are the redeemed one.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.359
What is my name?

13:41.155 --> 13:43.073
You know your name.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.536
No, no. There is another life.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.874
There is a sister, a high tower--

13:52.124 --> 13:53.417
No, no, no. Bewitchment.

13:53.751 --> 13:55.336
False memories put into your head.

13:55.544 --> 13:59.215
I am your father and your lord.

14:00.883 --> 14:06.889
"And he who has another birth,
brought forth from the cold grasp of death

14:07.181 --> 14:11.018
"shall rise again and serve my order.

14:11.644 --> 14:14.563
<i>"I say this and it becomes.</i>

14:14.813 --> 14:18.526
"And I will give him the name of..."

14:20.402 --> 14:22.238
- Azrael.
- Yes.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.574
I am Azrael.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.119
My Lord Dumas...

14:30.246 --> 14:31.622
Command me.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.599
This man ordered my parents' death.
You're sure?

14:52.184 --> 14:54.019
I know he was part of the reason
they were killed.

14:54.645 --> 14:55.980
Why is he not under arrest?

14:56.355 --> 14:57.815
It's not so simple, hoss.

14:58.107 --> 15:00.442
The evidence we have is far too tenuous
for a warrant.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.987
It's ancient hearsay, not fingerprints.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.613
Only witness is dead.

15:04.822 --> 15:06.198
Barnes wouldn't even say no.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.534
He would just look at me like I was nuts.

15:10.578 --> 15:11.704
I'm sick of this.

15:13.289 --> 15:14.582
We know where Strange is.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.501
We know he's hurting people right now,
and you two are talking about politics

15:17.668 --> 15:19.295
with your boss and
getting a piece of paper signed.

15:19.503 --> 15:22.006
- This is the way it works, Bruce.
- Why?

15:22.464 --> 15:23.674
You're not a cop anymore.

15:27.595 --> 15:28.887
Give us a second?

15:33.642 --> 15:36.687
Bruce, I know you're frustrated.
But we need to do this the right way.

15:36.979 --> 15:40.065
The right way? And how many times
did that fail with Galavan?

15:41.358 --> 15:43.193
- It's not the same.
- He bent and broke the law

15:43.402 --> 15:46.447
over and over again,
and Strange is doing the same thing.

15:46.947 --> 15:49.033
This man killed Karen, maybe my parents.

15:50.784 --> 15:53.871
Look, I appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

15:55.039 --> 15:57.374
But I fear we're going down
the same path as before,

15:57.541 --> 15:59.543
- and we won't get justice unless--
- Unless what?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.631
What you did to Galavan.

16:04.423 --> 16:07.217
What you knew you had to do, because
of the bureaucracy and the red tape--

16:07.426 --> 16:08.552
What I had to do?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.889
I chose to kill a man in cold blood.

16:12.723 --> 16:15.517
And it was the wrong choice,
crossing that line.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.436
You'll pay for it.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.272
Over and over again, like I have been.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.399
Like I still am.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.654
And it will make you
more like the evil you're trying to fight.

16:31.784 --> 16:33.327
You need to be better.

16:34.995 --> 16:36.288
Do you understand me?

16:38.415 --> 16:39.875
Just hold out a little bit longer.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.251
<i>We'll work on Barnes.</i>

16:41.460 --> 16:44.546
Get him to sign off on a warrant.
And put Strange away for good.

16:46.465 --> 16:47.841
The right way.

16:52.096 --> 16:54.223
<i>Fearing
the knights had become soft and weak</i>

16:54.390 --> 16:55.849
<i>from lack of leadership,</i>

16:56.225 --> 17:00.145
<i>Lord Dumas split and divided them,
and formed a new faction.</i>

17:00.562 --> 17:05.609
<i>He named this new sect after himself,
calling it the Order of St. Dumas.</i>

17:06.318 --> 17:08.278
Okay. Impressive.

17:08.612 --> 17:09.613
Yes.

17:10.322 --> 17:13.534
His psyche
couldn't reconcile death and rebirth

17:13.701 --> 17:16.286
<i>until we gave it a grander context.</i>

17:17.746 --> 17:20.499
- A story.
- He's Azrael now.

17:21.291 --> 17:27.214
A fabled 12th century knight who died for
the cause of his feudal lord, Adam Dumas.

17:27.798 --> 17:31.301
This Dumas character was made a saint,
performed a lot of miracles and so forth

17:31.468 --> 17:34.638
and one of those miracles
was bringing Azrael back to life.

17:35.556 --> 17:37.599
I still prefer Thorazine.

17:38.475 --> 17:41.395
You need to learn to work
with what you have, Ms. Peabody.

17:43.313 --> 17:44.440
Okay.

17:44.648 --> 17:49.027
Our creations need new personas to equal
and embody what they have become,

17:49.236 --> 17:50.904
to give their minds focus.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.618
Perhaps this was Mr. Galavan's destiny
all along.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.329
How do you even know
if the persona will hold?

17:59.705 --> 18:01.707
There's only one way to find out.

18:02.040 --> 18:07.963
We send our beautiful monster out in
the wild with a simple task to perform.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.633
He's going to need something to wear.

18:15.012 --> 18:18.682
"Mr. Nygma,
you have actually been helpful.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.851
"Mr. Nygma,
you have actually been helpful."

18:21.018 --> 18:22.770
This imbecile. The complete arrogance.

18:27.191 --> 18:30.194
Inmate Helzinger. Come with me.

18:30.986 --> 18:31.987
Yes, ma'am.

18:50.714 --> 18:54.218
Why do they keep disappearing
down that hallway?

18:56.762 --> 18:58.555
Strange is hiding something.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.146
Where are you taking me?
Where are we going?

19:09.358 --> 19:10.818
<i>Where are we going?</i>

19:33.674 --> 19:35.259
How interesting.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.143
Move.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.733
Hey, I know you.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.112
<i>I have a gift for you, my son.</i>

19:57.281 --> 20:01.535
I'm crafting your armor as we speak.
But first, your skills must be tested.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
I got it.

20:04.997 --> 20:06.290
You're the mayor.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.710
What is this place? What is going on?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.129
- That is a demon.
- What is going on in here?

20:12.337 --> 20:14.256
- He lives in fire.
- I wanna get out of here.

20:14.464 --> 20:17.092
That case will give you
everything you need to destroy him.

20:17.384 --> 20:18.510
<i>I wanna get out of here!</i>

20:19.052 --> 20:24.391
Let me out of here. Let me out.
I wanna get out of here. I wanna--

20:29.855 --> 20:32.482
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but good enough.

20:32.816 --> 20:36.445
Try opening the chest, my son.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.203
<i>The Sword of Sin.</i>

20:47.247 --> 20:49.583
Your ally and instrument of justice.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.421
A vanquisher of evil for generations.
She thirsts for blood.

20:55.172 --> 20:58.425
Generations? That sword
was made yesterday.

20:58.675 --> 20:59.801
It doesn't matter.

21:00.010 --> 21:03.347
Our replica is central to his acceptance
of his new identity.

21:03.639 --> 21:06.975
An awe-inspiring signature weapon.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.355
What must I do?

21:13.106 --> 21:16.068
A murderer walks the streets of the city
a free man.

21:16.401 --> 21:20.530
For his sin, by your blade,
he must be destroyed.

21:20.864 --> 21:24.743
- Tell me his name.
- James Gordon.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.538
My Lord, I am the Angel of Death.

21:29.748 --> 21:32.084
James Gordon dies...

21:36.129 --> 21:37.130
Tonight.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.553
<i>My officers responded
to an anonymous tip</i>

21:44.388 --> 21:46.264
and arrived here earlier this evening.

21:47.099 --> 21:48.850
Upon entering the construction site,

21:49.059 --> 21:53.730
my men discovered the bodies
of four male victims.

21:54.231 --> 21:57.901
It will be some time before we have
any information about their identities.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.737
Uh. Uh...

22:01.196 --> 22:02.906
That's all I have for you at this time.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.324
Excuse me.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.326
No, that's it.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.789
- Hey, Cap. Look who I found.
- Shut it, Bullock.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.041
- You have one hell of a nerve.
- Listen.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.585
You think I don't know it was you
that busted out Karen Jennings?

22:15.794 --> 22:17.087
- Tell me it wasn't you.
- Captain--

22:17.337 --> 22:19.631
No. I don't wanna hear it.
How do I keep falling for your games?

22:19.798 --> 22:21.091
Really, it's a mystery to me.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.635
Every time you come back,
I truly believe that you've changed.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.470
You're like an optical illusion.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.097
Listen, I just need
five minutes of your time.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.433
Hargrove, Snead, escort Mr. Gordon

22:29.599 --> 22:31.601
off my crime scene immediately.

22:31.852 --> 22:34.771
You. We're gonna have a little discussion
about this tomorrow morning.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.274
Captain Barnes, please. Hear him out.

22:37.607 --> 22:38.859
Listen, kid...

22:39.401 --> 22:40.527
Mr. Wayne.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.405
I don't care how much money
or pull you have in this town.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.450
- I'm through talking to him.
- Are you through listening to the truth?

22:47.951 --> 22:49.786
Oh, come on. Give me a break.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.461
All right, five minutes.
No, three minutes.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.468
Okay, bobby pins?

23:05.927 --> 23:08.263
- Only one?
- It's all I could steal.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.308
It'll have to do.
Rudy, did you get the ammonia?

23:11.641 --> 23:12.809
Here.

23:13.185 --> 23:16.772
- Perfect.
- Okay. Now we just need the bug zapper.

23:18.315 --> 23:20.192
- What is this?
- It's a fly swatter.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.819
I can see that it's a fly swatter.
I didn't ask for a fly swatter.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.321
I asked for the bug zapper in the kitchen.

23:24.488 --> 23:25.697
What's the difference?

23:26.073 --> 23:27.491
The difference is that
one has a black light

23:27.699 --> 23:29.868
that emits ultraviolet energy,
and this is leather on a stick.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.495
They both kill flies.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.081
I don't need to kill flies.
I need you to go back to the kitchen

23:34.498 --> 23:35.665
and get the bug zapper.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.418
What are you gonna do
with all this stuff anyway?

23:41.046 --> 23:43.048
I think Professor Strange
is hiding something.

23:43.507 --> 23:46.676
And I think that something
is a secret way out of this dump.

23:46.927 --> 23:50.722
So I'm gonna use this stuff to find it.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.855
So, in a nutshell,

23:59.356 --> 24:03.568
Hugo Strange is making monsters
out of dead people in his spare time.

24:03.902 --> 24:06.571
And he had Karen Jennings
killed by Victor Fries,

24:06.947 --> 24:11.284
- who's been dead for three months.
- I know it sounds far-fetched.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.787
Far-fetched? No. It sounds insane.

24:13.954 --> 24:16.331
But it's true. Trust me.

24:16.581 --> 24:18.708
How can I trust you
when you're talking crazy?

24:18.875 --> 24:21.920
How can I trust you when you've lied to me
so many times? Monsters?

24:22.170 --> 24:24.214
I lied to you because it's hard
to tell you the truth.

24:24.548 --> 24:28.218
You're stubborn and you're angry and
the GCPD has paid a price for it.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.428
Really? You self-righteous punk.

24:30.679 --> 24:33.223
You think you have all the answers?
Maybe you should run it yourself.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.475
- Maybe I will one day.
- In your dreams.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.688
Who's there?

24:43.775 --> 24:46.653
- I said who's out there?
- What the hell?

24:49.906 --> 24:51.324
<i>James Gordon.</i>

24:52.409 --> 24:55.036
<i>The time for your penance has come.</i>

24:56.037 --> 24:57.497
You know this guy?

24:58.248 --> 24:59.457
Who are you?

24:59.708 --> 25:01.418
<i>I am Azrael,</i>

25:02.252 --> 25:04.629
<i>righteous scourge of sins,</i>

25:05.463 --> 25:08.592
<i>and I have come to kill you, James Gordon.</i>

25:12.304 --> 25:13.597
Put down that weapon.

25:14.139 --> 25:17.267
Put the weapon down.
Put it down right now or I'll shoot.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.046
<i>Captain!</i>

25:53.720 --> 25:54.971
Jim!

26:24.167 --> 26:27.212
I need information now.
What do we know about this guy?

26:27.754 --> 26:31.299
Just what you saw. Calls himself Azrael.
Wants to kill me.

26:33.009 --> 26:35.345
We know Hugo Strange is responsible.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.931
- Told you so, did he?
- Who else could it be?

26:38.431 --> 26:39.683
I have no idea.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.643
I have to find out the facts.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.561
<i>Fun part of being a police detective.</i>

26:43.728 --> 26:46.189
- Instead of a loose cannon vigilante--
<i>- Excuse me, Captain.</i>

26:46.564 --> 26:48.817
I find your flippant attitude
to be inappropriate.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.570
I find you to be
kind of a pain in the ass.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.448
- What's he even doing here?
- I'm a concerned citizen.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.534
I wanna know
what you're doing about all of this.

26:58.201 --> 26:59.202
You...

27:00.036 --> 27:01.037
Oh, uh...

27:01.538 --> 27:03.331
<i>I'm gonna assemble a strike force.</i>

27:04.374 --> 27:06.251
Call in all off-duty personnel.

27:06.751 --> 27:09.713
We're gonna dragnet the living daylights
out of this whacko.

27:10.005 --> 27:13.216
A knight from outer space
shouldn't be hard to find, right?

27:14.509 --> 27:15.510
Okay?

27:16.261 --> 27:17.637
That's what <i>we're</i> gonna do.

27:18.054 --> 27:21.725
What you're gonna do is go home and stop
inserting yourself into police business.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.393
- Captain--
- That's the final word.

27:26.980 --> 27:27.981
He's right.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.734
It's time you went home.
Leave the rest of this to the police...

27:31.026 --> 27:33.278
- And to me.
- This is not just police business.

27:33.611 --> 27:34.738
This is my business, too.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.866
I can't make the moves I need to make
if I'm worrying about you.

27:38.116 --> 27:40.910
You need to be at home,
where Alfred can look after you.

28:05.185 --> 28:07.812
Hello, Grace. How are you today?

28:11.483 --> 28:13.610
<i>Incredibly, the attacker
fled the crime scene by,</i>

28:13.777 --> 28:15.111
<i>for all intents and purposes,</i>

28:15.278 --> 28:16.905
<i>scaling the side of the structure,</i>

28:17.072 --> 28:18.448
<i>literally disappearing into thin air.</i>

28:18.740 --> 28:22.035
<i>In all my years, Ken, I must say,
I've never seen anything quite like it.</i>

28:22.202 --> 28:24.746
<i>That a human being
should be capable of such feats.</i>

28:25.038 --> 28:26.539
<i>It just astounds the mind.</i>

28:40.762 --> 28:43.723
<i>Theo Galavan,
the new Mayor of Gotham.</i>

28:43.932 --> 28:46.643
<i>Oh, brother, like I don't
know you from way back.</i>

28:47.560 --> 28:49.270
<i>Remember.</i>

28:51.981 --> 28:53.817
<i>He calls himself Azrael.</i>

28:54.192 --> 28:58.988
He's armed, dangerous, and has exhibited
some extraordinary physical abilities.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.950
But no one, and I mean no one,

29:02.992 --> 29:06.121
comes into our city
and tries to carve up my officers.

29:06.704 --> 29:09.791
<i>We're gonna go out tonight
and we're gonna comb each and every block</i>

29:09.999 --> 29:12.043
<i>until we find this masked freak</i>

29:12.669 --> 29:14.963
and put him behind bars where he belongs.

29:16.714 --> 29:18.466
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.718
Good. Now get out there and get him.

29:24.347 --> 29:25.849
What are you doing?

29:26.349 --> 29:28.143
- I'm going out there.
- The hell you are.

29:28.476 --> 29:29.519
Excuse me?

29:29.769 --> 29:31.187
You're staying here
for your own protection.

29:31.521 --> 29:32.897
That's an order.

29:33.481 --> 29:36.901
I'm not a cop anymore, remember?
I don't need to follow your orders.

29:39.487 --> 29:40.947
You're absolutely right.

29:41.448 --> 29:44.033
You two. Put Mr. Gordon, here, in lockup.

29:44.617 --> 29:46.369
- What?
- I'm holding you on suspicion

29:46.619 --> 29:49.164
of breaking Karen Jennings
out of GCPD custody.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.375
- Don't do this.
- I've already done it.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.673
So many stories to choose from.

29:59.174 --> 30:01.384
I feel like a child on Christmas morning.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.386
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

30:03.553 --> 30:06.473
I want to install personas
into more subjects immediately.

30:06.723 --> 30:09.100
Everything we've worked for
is finally within reach.

30:11.728 --> 30:15.064
'"But I don't want to go among
mad people,' Alice remarked.

30:15.565 --> 30:17.859
'"Oh, you can't help that,' said the cat.

30:18.276 --> 30:20.236
""We're all mad here.""

30:21.279 --> 30:25.116
Oh, yes. Yes. That will do nicely.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.342
No news from the search.

30:42.926 --> 30:45.261
- Let me out of here.
- This is for your own good.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.306
Trust me.
You've broken enough laws for one day.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.725
There are times when breaking the law
is the right thing to do.

30:51.226 --> 30:55.522
- And who gets to decide that. You?
- Yeah. Someone has to.

30:55.688 --> 30:57.106
No, Jim. You're wrong.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.526
Look where Gotham's going.

31:00.109 --> 31:03.446
Maniacs, perverts and freaks
crawling out of every hole.

31:03.780 --> 31:05.698
<i>It's like a sea of evil flooding the city.</i>

31:05.949 --> 31:10.912
If a man doesn't cling onto the law,
he'll lose his bearings. Drowned.

31:19.462 --> 31:21.506
- Blackout?
- I don't think so.

31:22.966 --> 31:24.884
Yeah, me neither.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.751
<i>James Gordon.</i>

32:03.590 --> 32:06.009
Back up against the cell. Move.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.598
This is Captain Barnes of the GCPD.

32:12.348 --> 32:17.061
Whoever you are, step into the light,
or we will take you out.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.147
<i>But I am the light.</i>

32:19.981 --> 32:23.192
<i>Tasked with vanquishing the evil
in that cell.</i>

32:24.193 --> 32:25.903
You can die trying.

32:26.696 --> 32:29.741
<i>You lead these men,
so I will parlay with you.</i>

32:30.241 --> 32:32.785
- Parlay?
<i>- Order them to stand aside,</i>

32:32.994 --> 32:35.413
<i>and allow the sinner, James Gordon,
to be punished.</i>

32:35.913 --> 32:38.416
<i>Do this and I will spare them all.</i>

32:39.083 --> 32:42.211
<i>Decline, and they will face my judgment.</i>

32:43.004 --> 32:45.089
<i>Their lives now rest in your hands.</i>

32:45.882 --> 32:47.550
<i>How many will die?</i>

32:47.967 --> 32:49.886
<i>All? Or one?</i>

32:50.720 --> 32:52.263
<i>Decide, Captain.</i>

32:53.348 --> 32:56.267
- You can go to hell.
<i>- I've been there.</i>

32:57.852 --> 32:59.062
<i>You go.</i>

33:02.190 --> 33:04.400
<i>Over there. You see him?</i>

33:14.577 --> 33:15.912
<i>Where'd he go?</i>

33:16.120 --> 33:17.580
<i>I don't know.
You got eyes on him?</i>

33:34.847 --> 33:36.265
Get him out of there!

33:46.984 --> 33:50.571
<i>Such an amazing tool of destruction.</i>

33:52.198 --> 33:53.950
<i>Vile sorcery.</i>

34:28.192 --> 34:29.819
We need a bigger gun.

34:30.653 --> 34:31.654
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:32.029 --> 34:33.948
I'm gonna lure the freak up the stairs.

34:34.323 --> 34:37.034
And you show up with something
that will tear a hole in this bastard.

34:37.326 --> 34:39.162
- You got it.
- Let's get to the roof right now.

35:16.032 --> 35:17.033
<i>You.</i>

35:18.576 --> 35:20.745
<i>You will show me to him.</i>

35:21.996 --> 35:24.957
<i>You will tell me where he is.</i>

35:25.541 --> 35:26.584
<i>And then what?</i>

35:27.502 --> 35:28.961
You'll spare my life?

35:29.670 --> 35:31.214
<i>It's too late for that.</i>

35:31.881 --> 35:34.634
<i>The most I can offer you
is a painless death.</i>

35:36.344 --> 35:37.720
Let's dance.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.402
<i>That is not possible.</i>

36:07.041 --> 36:08.084
You?

36:09.836 --> 36:11.254
You're dead.

36:11.504 --> 36:12.713
Not anymore.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.735
Finally.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.448
Come to me.

36:41.784 --> 36:44.370
And I will show you the way to hell.

36:45.454 --> 36:46.497
I know the way.

37:01.470 --> 37:03.598
<i>For those just joining us,
we're coming to you live</i>

37:03.764 --> 37:05.808
<i>from outside of the
Gotham City Police Department.</i>

37:10.771 --> 37:12.148
<i>There's been a major impact</i>

37:12.315 --> 37:14.901
<i>on the vehicle.
It appears a body has fallen...</i>

37:15.067 --> 37:16.986
<i>- It's Theo Galavan...</i>
<i>- Theo Galavan...</i>

37:18.279 --> 37:20.323
<i>- Theo Galavan wearing a...
- Oh, my God.</i>

37:21.657 --> 37:23.701
<i>- Looks like he has...
- Right...</i>

37:24.201 --> 37:27.580
<i>Once again, we are confirming that
the former Mayor of Gotham city,</i>

37:27.788 --> 37:31.626
<i>Theo Galavan, is alive and
dressed in a bizarre costume.</i>

37:31.959 --> 37:32.960
Boss?

37:33.502 --> 37:34.921
Boss? Boss?

37:36.589 --> 37:39.508
It's getting crazy in this town, huh, Jim?

37:39.675 --> 37:41.802
Don't talk, just breathe.

37:42.136 --> 37:44.305
- I've tried.
- You're gonna be okay.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.806
Sure, I am.

37:46.349 --> 37:48.309
You're a pain in the ass, you know that?

37:48.976 --> 37:50.353
That makes two of us.

37:52.647 --> 37:57.777
Boss, breathe. Come on, Captain.
Hold on, stay with me. Boss.

38:03.157 --> 38:05.368
BP's falling fast. We got to go now.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.787
Radio Gotham General.
Let them know we're coming in hot.

38:08.037 --> 38:10.373
Jim? Jim, what the hell happened?
You okay?

38:10.539 --> 38:11.540
Yeah.

38:11.916 --> 38:13.250
It was Galavan.

38:14.251 --> 38:16.545
- You sure?
- I know it's hard to believe.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.173
But Azrael is Galavan.

38:34.814 --> 38:35.898
Barb.

38:38.275 --> 38:39.610
It's a little irritating.

38:39.777 --> 38:40.820
Oh.

38:40.987 --> 38:42.321
Sorry.

38:43.823 --> 38:44.907
Hey.

38:48.411 --> 38:49.578
Babes.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.497
Relax.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.165
Yeah.

38:54.834 --> 38:56.085
No, I...

38:57.586 --> 38:59.380
You guys have been so good to me.

38:59.964 --> 39:01.424
That's okay. Don't worry.

39:02.258 --> 39:03.592
Cocktails.

39:04.969 --> 39:06.554
I make great cocktails.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.807
- Sure. That'd be nice.
- What do you want?

39:10.474 --> 39:12.768
- Uh, bourbon--
- Gimlets.

39:14.145 --> 39:16.647
- Actually, bourbon sounds--
- I'm making gimlets.

39:20.484 --> 39:22.445
Okay. She scares me.

39:23.029 --> 39:24.613
Don't be a baby. She's harmless.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.366
Honey, I know you like her,

39:27.575 --> 39:29.368
but that woman's mad
as a bag of squirrels.

39:29.618 --> 39:32.121
- She said she's cured.
- That's what an insane person would say.

39:34.373 --> 39:35.875
Do we have any limes?

39:36.625 --> 39:37.668
No.

39:38.044 --> 39:39.086
Oh, my God.

39:39.420 --> 39:41.964
<i>That's right, Don.
The masked assassin that attacked the GCPD</i>

39:42.131 --> 39:46.469
<i>earlier tonight has been identified
as former Mayor, Theo Galavan.</i>

39:47.094 --> 39:48.971
<i>Theo? It can't be.</i>

39:49.889 --> 39:51.223
Holy moly.

39:54.310 --> 39:56.312
<i>The assassin was forced
off the roof,</i>

39:56.562 --> 40:00.816
<i>then fell right over there,
then stood up in front of all of us.</i>

40:01.067 --> 40:04.320
<i>And it was him, Theo Galavan, alive.</i>

40:04.737 --> 40:08.741
<i>And from what we know, responsible for
three officers fatalities.</i>

40:11.243 --> 40:12.995
Hello, old friend.

40:17.208 --> 40:20.169
...<i>is still at large
and is considered extremely dangerous.</i>

40:20.503 --> 40:21.670
Well...

40:22.171 --> 40:24.507
He must have never have been dead.

40:24.673 --> 40:26.008
I mean, that's the only possibility.

40:26.175 --> 40:29.095
I mean, no one dies and
comes back to life again, do they?

40:29.762 --> 40:30.763
No one.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.515
But he did.

40:34.308 --> 40:35.434
Strange.

40:36.268 --> 40:37.728
Strange must be behind this.

40:38.020 --> 40:41.023
What the hell is happening to our city?

40:42.191 --> 40:43.526
Nothing good.

40:48.364 --> 40:51.992
<i>- Oh, no. I don't wanna go.</i>
<i>- You're just going to...</i>

41:17.601 --> 41:18.853
Ah!

42:29.965 --> 42:31.175
Oh, my.
