00:12.901 --> 00:14.301
Abu Fayed,

00:14.368 --> 00:15.800
a citizen of your country,

00:15.867 --> 00:17.067
enters the United States,

00:17.134 --> 00:18.734
detonates a nuclear bomb

00:18.800 --> 00:20.067
killing thousands.

00:20.134 --> 00:23.034
Next, Assad attempts
to assassinate the president.

00:23.101 --> 00:25.567
AMBASSADOR:
 <i>You know fully well</i>
 <i>that we have cooperated</i>

00:25.634 --> 00:27.800
with you since
the inception of this crisis.

00:27.867 --> 00:29.834
I had an understanding
with your president.

00:29.901 --> 00:31.667
And now you're going
to have one with me.

00:31.734 --> 00:34.500
You help us find those nukes
before another goes off,

00:34.567 --> 00:36.901
or I'm going to unleash
the full power of our military

00:36.967 --> 00:38.533
on your country.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.533
VASILI:
I'm terminating the American.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.201
Do you confirm?

00:42.268 --> 00:43.500
Yes.

00:45.301 --> 00:47.500
(grunting)

00:47.567 --> 00:49.433
MARKOV:
 <i>The American has shot Vasili.</i>

00:49.500 --> 00:51.667
He's in the basement.

00:51.734 --> 00:53.101
Shut down the phone lines, DSL,

00:53.167 --> 00:54.867
 <i>everything!</i>

00:54.934 --> 00:56.500
JACK:
 <i>Morris, it's Jack.</i>

00:56.567 --> 00:59.001
I know how
to find Gredenko.

00:59.067 --> 01:00.001
He's in the...
(dial tone)

01:00.067 --> 01:00.967
Morris?

01:01.034 --> 01:03.368
Jack? Jack?

01:04.934 --> 01:06.167
Jack Bauer's currently
being held captive 

01:06.234 --> 01:07.533
in the Russian consulate.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.400
Doyle will help you
put a tactical profile together

01:10.467 --> 01:12.334
for an assault on the consulate.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.767
DOYLE:
 <i>Our primary objective</i>

01:14.834 --> 01:16.767
is to abduct Anatoly Markov,
the consul.

01:16.834 --> 01:19.268
According to Jack, Markov knows
how to find Gredenko,

01:19.334 --> 01:22.201
who controls the remaining
three suitcase nukes.

01:22.268 --> 01:23.800
The Americans are coming in.

01:23.867 --> 01:25.567
I thought you had that
under control.

01:25.634 --> 01:28.101
 <i>Won't be long</i>
 <i>before they have your position.</i>

01:28.167 --> 01:29.634
This drone is ready to launch.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.201
Arm the bomb.

01:31.268 --> 01:32.867
What's going on
at the Russian consulate?

01:32.934 --> 01:35.067
Jack Bauer's still at large
and somewhere inside.

01:35.134 --> 01:37.467
 <i>We have to go in.</i>

01:44.433 --> 01:45.567
Drop your weapon!

01:48.700 --> 01:50.500
My name is Jack Bauer.

01:50.567 --> 01:52.334
You need to contact
Bill Buchanan.

01:52.400 --> 01:53.901
Tell him that
Fayed and Gredenko

01:53.967 --> 01:54.934
are in the Shadow Valley.

01:55.001 --> 01:56.700
Patch me in
with Buchanan.

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:07.567 --> 02:10.532
(indistinct radio transmissions)

02:23.700 --> 02:25.001
Medevac's on the way.

02:25.067 --> 02:26.134
How you holding up?

02:26.201 --> 02:27.634
I'm fine.
Doc?

02:27.700 --> 02:29.268
He may have floating
rib fragments 

02:29.334 --> 02:31.334
which could cause
internal bleeding.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.800
He needs
to be stabilized.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.268
Agent Doyle,
I told you I'm fine.

02:34.334 --> 02:35.600
I want to be involved
in this mission.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.600
CTU has the ball, Jack.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.634
Right now, this is out
of your hands.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.301
We now believe Gredenko
is in possession

02:48.368 --> 02:51.268
of at least five
RQ-2 Aerial Drones

02:51.334 --> 02:52.533
(over speakerphone):
somewhere in Shadow Valley.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.834
RQ-2s?

02:53.901 --> 02:55.368
Unmanned stealth aircraft

02:55.433 --> 02:58.067
which can be remotely piloted
from anywhere in the world.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.467
And Gredenko's arming them

02:59.533 --> 03:01.700
with the nuclear weapons
he provided to Fayed?

03:01.767 --> 03:03.201
Yes, sir.

03:03.268 --> 03:05.467
We're redirecting satellite
coverage over the Mojave Desert,

03:05.533 --> 03:07.834
and the Air Force is scrambling
F-16s from Edwards.

03:07.901 --> 03:10.433
But you have no idea how
close Fayed and Gredenko are

03:10.500 --> 03:11.834
to launching
these drones?

03:11.901 --> 03:12.867
No, sir, we don't.

03:12.934 --> 03:14.867
(sighs):
All right, Bill.

03:14.934 --> 03:16.533
You keep me updated.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.901
Yes, sir.

03:22.901 --> 03:24.800
GREDENKO:
Bring the trucks around.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.600
We are moving out now.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.867
What's wrong?

03:27.934 --> 03:29.767
How many drones
have been armed?

03:29.834 --> 03:31.001
Just this one.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.368
GREDENKO:
Damn it.

03:32.433 --> 03:33.901
We need to launch it now.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.368
Get it ready.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.500
Go, go.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.001
Tell me what's wrong.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.001
What's wrong?

03:43.067 --> 03:45.334
The Americans
know our location.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.001
How?

03:47.067 --> 03:48.600
It was Markov, huh?

03:48.667 --> 03:51.201
Markov told them.

03:51.268 --> 03:54.167
All that matters is
that they know we are here.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.234
We need to launch the drone
before they close in.

03:57.301 --> 04:00.167
We have three bombs
and three targets.

04:00.234 --> 04:03.234
We'll find a way to deliver
the other two bombs.

04:05.001 --> 04:09.034
All this time we've tolerated
your condescension,

04:09.101 --> 04:11.334
berating us for losing
the other bombs.

04:11.400 --> 04:13.301
But now it's your fault.

04:13.368 --> 04:15.234
Markov was your man.

04:15.301 --> 04:17.433
Blame me all you want,
but if we stay here,

04:17.500 --> 04:19.399
we'll be captured
or killed.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.234
Refit the other bombs
into their casings

04:25.301 --> 04:26.567
and load them on the truck.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.234
Do it now!

04:28.301 --> 04:29.967
Take them out!

04:31.167 --> 04:33.600
We're accelerating our schedule.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.301
Why?

04:35.368 --> 04:36.834
I don't have time to explain.

04:36.901 --> 04:41.134
I need you to launch
drone 0-7-0-9.

04:41.201 --> 04:44.167
I haven't finished implementing
the evasion vectors.

04:44.234 --> 04:46.567
They'll shoot it down
before it reaches its target.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.500
Launch the drone.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.767
You'll execute evasion tactics
once it's in the air.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.834
Yes, sir.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.567
(engine whooshing)

05:25.734 --> 05:27.934
We need to leave now.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.967
Come on, let's go.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.034
We're repositioning
our satellites

05:38.101 --> 05:39.500
as fast as we can, sir.

05:39.567 --> 05:40.800
As soon as we make
visual contact,

05:40.867 --> 05:41.967
we'll uplink a real-time feed

05:42.034 --> 05:43.600
to your command.
(quietly):
Here.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.667
(over phone):
Lives are at stake, Yassir.
Get me that intel.

05:45.734 --> 05:47.467
Yes, sir.

05:49.101 --> 05:50.834
You okay?

05:52.901 --> 05:55.600
The truth? No, not really.

05:55.667 --> 05:56.967
Hey.

05:57.034 --> 05:58.901
We're going to get
through this, okay?

05:58.967 --> 06:01.234
I hope so.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.901
Is there
a problem, Chloe?

06:09.967 --> 06:11.500
Yeah.

06:11.567 --> 06:13.368
Are you going to tell us
what it is?

06:13.433 --> 06:15.001
I was installing
security upgrades,

06:15.067 --> 06:17.334
and I noticed you were using
Milo's clearance code.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.334
Which, in case
you didn't know,

06:19.400 --> 06:21.268
is a felony security breach.

06:21.334 --> 06:23.167
No, it must be a mistake.

06:23.234 --> 06:24.867
My system's been glitchy,
and I think I...

06:24.934 --> 06:26.201
It's not a glitch, Milo.

06:26.268 --> 06:28.101
Nadia's been working
with your user I.D.

06:28.167 --> 06:30.034
So unless she stole it,
you gave it to her.

06:30.101 --> 06:33.167
Milo was just trying
to help me do my work.
Nadia...

06:33.234 --> 06:34.934
Homeland Security
sent down

06:35.001 --> 06:36.834
an order restricting
my security access

06:36.901 --> 06:39.034
because I was born
in the Middle East.

06:39.101 --> 06:42.533
I've heard of that directive,
and I think it's wrong for us

06:42.600 --> 06:44.667
to be racially profiling our
own agents, but it's still

06:44.734 --> 06:47.234
a felony security breach
for you to be using Milo's code.

06:47.301 --> 06:49.334
Chloe...

06:51.201 --> 06:53.667
If you report this,

06:53.734 --> 06:55.700
we can't help the situation

06:55.767 --> 06:57.800
if we're fired and arrested.

06:57.867 --> 07:00.901
If I wanted to report you,
I wouldn't be talking to you.

07:00.967 --> 07:03.533
I'm telling you this so
that you'll be careful.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.268
I mean, I noticed it.

07:05.334 --> 07:08.101
Someone else is going
to notice it sooner or later.

07:13.201 --> 07:14.467
BUCHANAN:
Nadia?

07:14.533 --> 07:16.301
Yes, sir.

07:16.368 --> 07:18.067
Morris has a satellite visual
on Shadow Valley.

07:18.134 --> 07:21.268
It looks like the terrorists
have launched a single drone.

07:21.334 --> 07:23.334
I'm conferencing
with General Walsh now.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.634
I'll be right there, sir.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.001
Coordinate with first-responders
in all target zones.

07:28.067 --> 07:30.067
Put General Walsh through.

07:30.134 --> 07:31.634
You're on with
Bill Buchanan, sir.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.400
This is Walsh.

07:33.467 --> 07:36.433
BUCHANAN:
General, we've made visual
contact with a single drone.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.001
We're tracking it on satellite.

07:38.067 --> 07:40.268
It's heading on a northwest
vector out of Shadow Valley.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.400
Altitude is 3,300 feet
and climbing.

07:42.467 --> 07:44.600
Velocity is 360 miles an hour.

07:44.667 --> 07:47.234
I'm looking at the specs
on the RQ-2 now.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.634
It's got a
low-profile design,

07:48.700 --> 07:51.433
virtually impossible
to detect by radar.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.268
We'll need to manually guide
our F-16s to intercept.

07:54.334 --> 07:56.700
We're uplinking
a video feed to you now.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.800
Have you determined
its intended target?

07:58.867 --> 07:59.967
Yes. This is Nadia Yassir.

08:00.034 --> 08:01.734
The closest target
is downtown Los Angeles.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.201
That's a four-minute window.

08:03.268 --> 08:07.368
Maximum airspeed of an RQ-2
is 400 miles per hour.

08:07.433 --> 08:10.767
My F-16s should be able to
intercept it within two minutes.

08:12.734 --> 08:14.268
MORRIS:
Um...

08:14.334 --> 08:15.268
that may be a problem.

08:15.334 --> 08:17.167
I can't find the drone.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.767
The drone's gone.

08:21.834 --> 08:22.800
How can it be gone?

08:22.867 --> 08:24.067
It was passing between grids,

08:24.134 --> 08:25.301
but when I switched
satellites...

08:25.368 --> 08:26.967
Readjust based on
projected vectors.

08:27.034 --> 08:28.301
I'm doing that now, General,

08:28.368 --> 08:29.800
it's just not where
it's supposed to be.

08:29.867 --> 08:33.634
Until you find it, I'll have my
F-16s stay in a holding pattern.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.600
(beeping)

08:39.667 --> 08:41.368
Yes?

08:41.433 --> 08:43.799
I've accessed our connection
to CTU.

08:43.866 --> 08:46.201
I've disabled
their tracking capability.

08:46.268 --> 08:47.400
Then they cannot

08:47.467 --> 08:49.301
detect the drone?

08:49.368 --> 08:51.334
No. And I'll be able
to keep it hidden

08:51.400 --> 08:54.467
from their satellites until
we've hit the target.

08:54.533 --> 09:00.667
Good. I'll contact you again
once we are out of the area.

09:02.767 --> 09:06.268
Sir, I was just talking
to Bill Buchanan at CTU.

09:06.334 --> 09:08.001
They were tracking
one of the drones.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.700
They've now lost
visual contact with it.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.234
Lost visual contact?

09:11.301 --> 09:12.433
Yeah, it's unclear

09:12.500 --> 09:13.667
just how, sir.

09:13.734 --> 09:15.500
They just simply
can't find it.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.867
We have the most sophisticated
satellite network in the world.

09:17.934 --> 09:19.600
How the hell did this happen?

09:19.667 --> 09:22.334
CTU is still trying
to determine that, sir.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.268
What about
the military?

09:24.334 --> 09:25.767
Well, they've got three
squadrons looking for it,

09:25.834 --> 09:27.034
but these drones
are invisible

09:27.101 --> 09:29.567
to radar, so the pilots
are limited to making

09:29.634 --> 09:32.867
visual ID at night
over hundreds of square miles.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.967
Now, CTU has a ranked list

09:36.034 --> 09:37.400
of potential
targets.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.400
They're running civil
disaster scenarios...

09:39.467 --> 09:40.600
Lisa?

09:40.667 --> 09:41.901
Sir?

09:41.967 --> 09:44.634
Advance the meeting
with the Joint Chiefs.

09:44.700 --> 09:45.867
When do you want
it to happen?

09:45.934 --> 09:47.467
Right away.

09:47.533 --> 09:49.134
Wait, sir. Why...

09:49.201 --> 09:50.901
Why are we assembling
the Joint Chiefs?

09:50.967 --> 09:53.201
I warned
the ambassador, Tom.

09:53.268 --> 09:54.800
You heard me tell him

09:54.867 --> 09:57.433
that I'd hold his country
responsible

09:57.500 --> 10:00.867
if another nuclear weapon
was detonated on our soil.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.867
Sir, there's
absolutely no evidence

10:02.934 --> 10:06.067
that his country
either sponsored these attacks

10:06.134 --> 10:07.901
or is even in support of them.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.967
His people need
to understand

10:10.034 --> 10:12.500
that I'm not just
rattling my saber.

10:12.567 --> 10:13.834
They need to see

10:13.901 --> 10:16.368
with their own eyes
that I will answer this threat

10:16.433 --> 10:18.901
with an in-kind
military response.

10:20.834 --> 10:22.301
Wait.

10:22.368 --> 10:25.167
"In kind," sir?

10:25.234 --> 10:27.167
I want the Joint Chiefs

10:27.234 --> 10:31.134
to draw up our own target list
for a nuclear strike.

10:57.433 --> 10:59.901
--At its rated speed, the drone
should have reached Los Angeles,

10:59.967 --> 11:01.967
so we can eliminate us
as a target.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.867
In the next few minutes,
I can take Santa Barbara

11:03.934 --> 11:05.334
and San Diego off the list.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.368
How many targets does that leave
within the drone's range?

11:07.433 --> 11:10.567
Counting cities with populations
over a million...

11:10.634 --> 11:11.767
fifteen.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.667
We have to narrow it down.

11:13.734 --> 11:16.533
Assuming they want the maximum
civilian death toll,

11:16.600 --> 11:18.967
how many likely targets
within the drone's range?

11:19.034 --> 11:21.101
Areas with the highest
population density are

11:21.167 --> 11:23.967
San Francisco, Las Vegas
and Phoenix.

11:24.034 --> 11:26.400
Confirm that NEST teams and
First Responders have deployed

11:26.467 --> 11:27.734
in those cities.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.234
Morris, make sure the
Air Force prioritizes

11:30.301 --> 11:33.101
their search
on that basis.
Yup.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.234
(gasps)

11:35.301 --> 11:37.268
Give me the projected
coordinates.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.101
Bill.

11:43.167 --> 11:44.334
Bill, did we pick up
Gredenko?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.433
We're working on it.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.567
Bill, what happened?

11:47.634 --> 11:49.600
Gredenko escaped.

11:49.667 --> 11:50.734
But not before
launching one

11:50.800 --> 11:51.867
of the drones.

11:51.934 --> 11:54.334
How close is the Air Force
to intercepting it?

11:54.400 --> 11:55.767
F-16s were minutes away,
then the drone disappeared

11:55.834 --> 11:57.433
from the satellite grid;
we're still looking for it.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.867
Jack.

11:59.934 --> 12:01.268
Get to medical.

12:01.334 --> 12:02.500
There's nothing
you can do here.

12:02.567 --> 12:04.301
Just keep me
informed, please.
I will.

12:04.368 --> 12:07.134
Doyle, I want you
to run point

12:07.201 --> 12:08.567
on the search for
Fayed and Gredenko.

12:08.634 --> 12:10.901
Milo's monitoring from
the Situation Room.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.268
I'll be right there.

12:20.034 --> 12:22.167
I'll see you over at Medical.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.134
Hey.
Hey.

12:25.201 --> 12:26.834
Could we have a moment, please?

12:26.901 --> 12:28.234
They said you
were hurt.

12:28.301 --> 12:30.268
I'm, I'm fine.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.600
As soon as all
of this is over,

12:37.667 --> 12:39.634
I'll come by and check
on you and Josh.

12:42.467 --> 12:46.167
I always regretted things didn't
work out between us...

12:46.234 --> 12:48.700
and...

12:48.767 --> 12:51.234
I always believed
you did, too.

12:58.934 --> 13:01.134
Maybe I was wrong.

13:02.201 --> 13:04.334
No, you weren't.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.268
Listen, Marilyn,

13:07.334 --> 13:10.767
before I was taken prisoner
by the Chinese...

13:10.834 --> 13:12.934
I, I was with someone.

13:13.001 --> 13:17.034
She doesn't even know
I'm still alive, but...

13:17.101 --> 13:19.167
I need to talk to her...

13:19.234 --> 13:21.234
see what happens.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.034
Are you talking
about Audrey Raines?

13:26.433 --> 13:28.067
Yeah.

13:30.167 --> 13:31.467
You don't know.

13:31.533 --> 13:33.567
Do you?
(sighs)

13:33.634 --> 13:35.234
Jack, I'm...

13:35.301 --> 13:38.467
I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this...

13:39.533 --> 13:42.634
Audrey's dead.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.834
I don't know all the details,
I just know what I read

13:44.901 --> 13:46.334
in the paper
about her accident.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.667
What accident? When?

13:47.734 --> 13:49.500
It was a few months ago.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.500
It was a car accident.

13:51.567 --> 13:53.567
Somewhere in China.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.934
China.

13:58.001 --> 14:00.400
Excuse me.

14:00.467 --> 14:01.500
I'm sorry.

14:01.567 --> 14:03.567
I have to go.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.600
(panting)

14:11.500 --> 14:12.700
CHLOE:
There'll be separate
channels open

14:12.767 --> 14:15.467
for all First Responders
in at-risk cities...

14:15.533 --> 14:18.101
All First Responders
should coordi...

14:18.167 --> 14:20.901
Why the hell didn't anybody
tell me about Audrey?

14:22.600 --> 14:25.034
Mr. Buchanan didn't want to tell
you when you first got back,

14:25.101 --> 14:26.201
because we all thought

14:26.268 --> 14:28.734
Fayed was just going
to kill you.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.067
But I probably should have.

14:31.134 --> 14:32.400
I'm sorry.

14:32.467 --> 14:34.368
She was in China looking for me?

14:34.433 --> 14:35.800
She was the one
who figured out

14:35.867 --> 14:36.967
the Chinese had taken you.

14:37.034 --> 14:38.268
Apparently she spent
the past year

14:38.334 --> 14:39.567
going through
back channels,

14:39.634 --> 14:40.800
to try to get you out.

14:40.867 --> 14:42.934
The rest of it's
classified by Division,

14:43.001 --> 14:44.268
I don't know any more.

14:44.334 --> 14:45.700
We were asked

14:45.767 --> 14:46.800
to send the DNA records,

14:46.867 --> 14:48.433
so that they could
get a positive ID

14:48.500 --> 14:51.268
on the remains...
which I guess they did.

14:51.334 --> 14:52.600
I want that file.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.667
All right, Jack.

14:54.734 --> 14:56.301
Now!

14:56.368 --> 14:58.001
I have to dig it up
in archives.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.201
Just do it.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.600
The Secretary of Defense

15:12.667 --> 15:14.634
and the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs
will be attending

15:14.700 --> 15:16.500
in person, the State
will be monitoring
via satellite.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.368
And the rest of the
Cabinet will be provided

15:18.433 --> 15:20.234
with video
transcripts.
Good.

15:20.301 --> 15:22.834
You should also know that
Karen Hayes will be attending.

15:24.433 --> 15:26.734
I thought I told you I wanted
her excluded from this.

15:28.433 --> 15:31.001
She supported Wayne Palmer's
policy of appeasement.

15:31.067 --> 15:32.600
She's going to be a problem.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.433
Well, there was nothing
I could do.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.667
She's still acting

15:35.734 --> 15:36.901
National Security
Advisor.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.834
But I've only given her
current circumstances.

15:39.901 --> 15:42.368
Any objection to your plans will
not be able to gain traction.

15:42.433 --> 15:43.634
(chuckles)

15:43.700 --> 15:47.134
Oh, I've known Karen Hayes
for many years.

15:47.201 --> 15:49.967
It's always been a mistake
to underestimate...

15:50.034 --> 15:52.934
her.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.001
Hello, Tom.

15:58.067 --> 16:01.034
Somebody push
you down the stairs?

16:01.101 --> 16:03.600
No, Karen, I tripped
over your ineptitude.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.634
On that subject,
welcome back.

16:05.700 --> 16:08.700
Look, Tom,
I don't want to play games.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.067
I won't let you
blackmail me again.

16:11.134 --> 16:12.700
So you do what you need to do,

16:12.767 --> 16:14.400
I am here to represent
the President,

16:14.467 --> 16:16.167
and I intend to stay.

16:16.234 --> 16:17.533
All right, fair enough.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.001
Karen.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.901
No one is sorrier than I am

16:21.967 --> 16:23.301
about what happened to Wayne.

16:25.368 --> 16:27.201
Well, at least we have that
in common.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.934
Please be seated.

16:50.600 --> 16:53.067
As many of you
are already aware,

16:53.134 --> 16:55.600
the terrorist who attacked us
this morning,

16:55.667 --> 16:58.934
Abu Fayed, with the help
of Dmitri Gredenko,

16:59.001 --> 17:01.400
has launched an aerial drone
that we believe is armed

17:01.467 --> 17:03.867
with another nuclear bomb.

17:05.567 --> 17:09.334
Efforts are ongoing
to locate this drone.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.733
But should
those efforts fail,

17:11.800 --> 17:13.901
we are looking at a second
nuclear attack on our country

17:13.967 --> 17:14.934
in less than ten hours.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.867
And I am determined

17:16.934 --> 17:18.767
not to let this
attack happen

17:18.834 --> 17:22.134
without a military response
on our part.

17:22.201 --> 17:24.934
A military response
directed against

17:25.001 --> 17:27.001
whom, Mr. Vice
President?

17:27.067 --> 17:28.300
We were under the impression

17:28.367 --> 17:30.334
that these terrorists were
essentially stateless.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.934
Secretary Kanin, that is
the fiction they hide behind.

17:34.001 --> 17:35.600
But...

17:35.667 --> 17:37.201
everyone in this room knows

17:37.268 --> 17:39.433
that elements within
Abu Fayed's country

17:39.500 --> 17:42.001
train and fund terrorist
organizations like his.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.167
It is time

17:43.234 --> 17:45.734
to hold them
accountable.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.400
The Ambassador
has just been informed

17:47.467 --> 17:48.600
that if the nuclear weapon

17:48.667 --> 17:50.301
on that drone detonates,

17:50.368 --> 17:54.034
we will retaliate
with our own nuclear strike.

17:54.101 --> 17:55.301
Now this will be

17:55.368 --> 17:58.400
a warning shot, not
a full-scale attack.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.800
The Joint Chiefs have been
instructed to identify

18:01.867 --> 18:03.934
an unpopulated area

18:04.001 --> 18:06.500
where there will be limited
civilian casualties.

18:06.567 --> 18:07.667
Admiral.

18:07.734 --> 18:10.700
The closest match
we have 

18:10.767 --> 18:13.268
to that scenario
is territory near
their northern border.

18:13.334 --> 18:16.368
We believe this should result
in fewer than 2,000 deaths.

18:16.433 --> 18:19.034
Long-term damage from
radioactive fallout, however,

18:19.101 --> 18:21.500
could double that number,
depending on ground conditions.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.834
I can accept that.

18:23.901 --> 18:25.334
Mr. Vice President,

18:25.400 --> 18:27.101
I'm sure you're aware
that our intelligence suggests

18:27.167 --> 18:29.334
that their government
can't control

18:29.400 --> 18:30.467
Fayed either.

18:30.533 --> 18:32.101
They are doing the best
that they can.

18:32.167 --> 18:36.134
And I'm saying they need to
figure out a way to do better.

18:36.201 --> 18:37.734
Something tells me

18:37.800 --> 18:40.034
that once this bomb hits,
they will.

18:40.101 --> 18:43.634
If this bomb hits,
the opposite will hold true.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.101
The moderates will be driven
from power,

18:46.167 --> 18:47.600
the terrorists' position
will be strengthened there

18:47.667 --> 18:49.467
and in the region,
and I don't hear anyone

18:49.533 --> 18:53.001
talking about the Chinese
or Russian response to this.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.467
We could start another
world war.

18:55.533 --> 18:57.533
If I thought there was a high
likelihood of that,

18:57.600 --> 18:59.234
I wouldn't be suggesting this.

18:59.301 --> 19:00.867
Mr. Vice President,

19:00.934 --> 19:03.533
the stakes are too high
for this decision to be based

19:03.600 --> 19:05.567
on your personal
judgment.

19:05.634 --> 19:07.167
It is my opinion

19:07.234 --> 19:11.134
that this course of action would
be dangerous and reckless.

19:11.201 --> 19:15.067
Consider your concern
registered, Karen.

19:17.567 --> 19:20.700
But the debate is over.

19:20.767 --> 19:22.400
America must start

19:22.467 --> 19:24.901
to stand up
for herself.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.734
The attacks on this
country must stop!

19:26.800 --> 19:29.433
And as acting
Commander In Chief,

19:29.500 --> 19:32.268
I believe this is the best way
to make that happen.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.767
Admiral,

19:38.834 --> 19:42.067
have a nuclear strike sub
standing by.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.867
--Nadia?

20:04.934 --> 20:07.300
I never got those SIM files
you were gonna send me.

20:07.367 --> 20:08.867
Oh, yeah, your system
was overloaded.

20:08.934 --> 20:10.200
So I gave them to Morris,

20:10.267 --> 20:12.267
he's going to take care
of it for you.
Morris?

20:12.333 --> 20:14.068
Yeah.

20:14.134 --> 20:16.168
I mean, you really think
he can handle it?

20:16.233 --> 20:19.034
Well, he seems
to be himself again.

20:19.101 --> 20:22.867
Is he himself because he had
a drink and he smoothed out?

20:22.934 --> 20:25.467
I don't think so.

20:31.034 --> 20:32.034
Hey.

20:32.101 --> 20:33.434
What are you doing?

20:33.500 --> 20:36.467
Setting up a reverse
data stream on the drone's

20:36.534 --> 20:38.200
satellite intel,
okay?

20:38.267 --> 20:40.767
Morris seems better.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.600
Is that a question?

20:43.667 --> 20:46.267
Is he?

20:46.333 --> 20:48.034
Yes.

20:48.101 --> 20:50.867
Look, I need you
to do me a favor.

20:50.934 --> 20:51.901
No.

20:51.967 --> 20:53.333
I need you to check his breathe.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.001
If he's better, great.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.168
If he had a drink

20:56.233 --> 20:57.567
and he's headed
for another crash

20:57.634 --> 20:59.300
we need to know about that.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.300
Fine.

21:12.934 --> 21:15.634
Thanks, darling.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.500
What was that for?

21:22.567 --> 21:24.534
Just checking
your breath.

21:29.534 --> 21:30.967
He's fine.

21:31.034 --> 21:32.867
Thank you.

21:33.934 --> 21:35.901
(typing)

21:35.967 --> 21:38.600
Got to love this place.

21:38.667 --> 21:39.834
HAYES:
Tom.

21:39.901 --> 21:40.867
Tom.

21:40.934 --> 21:42.034
Yes, Karen, I hear you.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.267
You can't possibly
be in favor

21:44.333 --> 21:46.200
of Daniels' plan for
a nuclear strike.

21:46.267 --> 21:47.634
You heard the Vice President.

21:47.701 --> 21:50.600
It's a warning shot
into an unpopulated area.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.333
It is a military offensive
on foreign soil.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.200
And you and
I both know

21:55.267 --> 21:58.134
it will be impossible
to contain.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.367
Tom, you know this is
insane, I know you do.

22:01.434 --> 22:02.600
I saw you in
that meeting.

22:02.667 --> 22:04.333
I saw the doubt in your eyes.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.233
Do not presume

22:07.300 --> 22:09.600
to know what I am
thinking or feeling.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.200
I serve at the discretion

22:11.267 --> 22:12.834
of those above me.

22:12.901 --> 22:14.567
You serve the interests
of the President.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.068
And you know that
Wayne would not

22:16.134 --> 22:17.701
sign off on this course
of action.

22:17.767 --> 22:19.001
Wayne was wrong.

22:19.068 --> 22:21.101
Every decision
he made today was wrong--

22:21.168 --> 22:23.001
rejecting
my security initiatives,

22:23.068 --> 22:24.267
using Assad as an appeal

22:24.333 --> 22:26.300
to extremist groups.

22:26.367 --> 22:27.767
And look what we've been led to!

22:27.834 --> 22:28.867
You can't seriously
believe that.

22:28.934 --> 22:29.867
You just cannot!

22:29.934 --> 22:32.233
Doesn't matter what I believe.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.600
As long as the President
is in a coma,

22:34.667 --> 22:37.300
Daniels is the acting
Commander in Chief.

22:37.367 --> 22:38.500
Now, if you want him

22:38.567 --> 22:41.168
to abort that missile launch,
you had better pray

22:41.233 --> 22:45.267
that CTU can find
and stop that drone.

22:48.967 --> 22:51.300
We've got ground teams
on all roads leading out

22:51.367 --> 22:53.200
of Shadow Valley looking
for Fayed and Gredenko,

22:53.267 --> 22:55.767
but with SAT support dedicated
to finding the drone,

22:55.834 --> 22:57.001
there's not much to go on.

22:57.068 --> 22:58.168
MILO:
And CalTrans doesn't have

22:58.233 --> 22:59.967
any cameras set up
in the outlying areas.

23:00.034 --> 23:01.767
Mr. Buchanan, we figured out

23:01.834 --> 23:03.434
how the drone
is able to stay hidden

23:03.500 --> 23:04.534
from our satellites.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.600
Whoever is piloting it
is able to anticipate

23:06.667 --> 23:07.801
our repositioning directives,

23:07.867 --> 23:09.534
flying through the gaps
in the images.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.134
How can he do that?

23:11.200 --> 23:12.734
CHLOE:
Our satellite data
is being relayed

23:12.801 --> 23:14.567
to the drone pilot
through a workstation here.

23:14.634 --> 23:15.767
We have a leak.

23:18.801 --> 23:20.300
One of our own people?

23:20.367 --> 23:21.534
Looks that way.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.200
Can you isolate the workstation?

23:23.267 --> 23:25.467
No. It's being masked
through a sub-circuit.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.168
Morris is working on it now,
but there are

23:27.233 --> 23:28.300
over 50 stations
in this building.

23:28.367 --> 23:29.300
It could take an hour

23:29.367 --> 23:30.367
to do a
signature trace.

23:30.434 --> 23:31.434
We don't have an hour.

23:34.567 --> 23:35.600
Run a trace match

23:35.667 --> 23:37.134
on Nadia Yassir's
station.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.367
Why Nadia?

23:39.434 --> 23:40.467
Do it.

23:40.534 --> 23:41.701
MILO: Wait, you
think just because

23:41.767 --> 23:42.801
she's a Muslim,
that gives you the right...

23:42.867 --> 23:44.168
I'm following
standard protocol.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.500
Standard protocol?
She's already
been tagged

23:45.567 --> 23:46.734
and given restricted clearance.

23:46.801 --> 23:47.801
(scoffs)

23:47.867 --> 23:49.434
And, yeah,

23:49.500 --> 23:51.434
she is a Muslim.

23:51.500 --> 23:52.634
That's enough to go on.

23:52.701 --> 23:54.168
Everyone here
is thinking it,

23:54.233 --> 23:55.600
even if they won't say it.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.400
You're a racist.

23:57.467 --> 23:58.400
BUCHANAN:
Milo,

23:58.467 --> 23:59.834
I understand your distaste.

23:59.901 --> 24:02.168
But we have to vet every
system in the building.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.434
There's no reason
not to start with hers.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.667
No, sir, there's every reason.

24:06.734 --> 24:09.233
Nadia Yassir's 100 percent
loyal to this country.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.534
She is not a terrorist.

24:10.600 --> 24:12.534
Is this assessment based on
some private knowledge?

24:12.600 --> 24:14.500
Or is it because you're
itching to sleep with her?

24:14.567 --> 24:16.134
Son of a...
BUCHANAN:
All right!

24:16.200 --> 24:16.867
That's enough!

24:18.333 --> 24:20.367
Agent Doyle,

24:20.434 --> 24:21.867
that was way out of line.

24:21.934 --> 24:24.367
We don't have time for
your personal differences.

24:24.434 --> 24:27.667
We have to find out
who's subverting our system.

24:31.434 --> 24:32.467
It is Nadia.

24:33.934 --> 24:35.867
The signature trace
matches her computer.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.567
Shut down her workstation.

24:37.634 --> 24:40.134
CHLOE:
I'm trying. The only way to cut
the data flow is to reboot

24:40.200 --> 24:41.634
CTU's mainframe.

24:41.701 --> 24:43.667
We'd be without system power
for more than 20 minutes.

24:43.734 --> 24:45.367
Get security on the floor now.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.333
Surrender
your station.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.734
Excuse me?

24:57.801 --> 25:00.467
Who are you streaming
our satellite data to?
What?!

25:00.534 --> 25:02.034
Where is the pilot?
BUCHANAN:
Doyle, damn it,

25:02.101 --> 25:03.068
that's enough!

25:06.801 --> 25:07.934
Take her to holding.

25:08.001 --> 25:10.801
Bill, don't let,
don't let him do this!

25:10.867 --> 25:12.168
What are
you doing?!

25:14.168 --> 25:15.333
Bill, I'm innocent!

25:15.400 --> 25:16.901
I'm not a traitor!

25:25.434 --> 25:26.500
Morris,

25:26.567 --> 25:28.200
secure her station.

25:28.267 --> 25:29.834
See if you can
run a back trace

25:29.901 --> 25:31.367
on that leak.

25:31.434 --> 25:33.200
Find out where
the feed is going.

25:33.267 --> 25:35.233
Excuse me.

25:48.834 --> 25:49.967
Victor.

25:50.034 --> 25:53.434
What is the drone's
current position?

25:53.500 --> 25:56.034
130 miles

25:56.101 --> 25:58.034
southeast of target.

25:58.101 --> 26:00.801
Have you locked in
the GPS coordinates?

26:00.867 --> 26:02.267
Yes.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.400
The bomb will detonate
over San Francisco

26:05.467 --> 26:07.101
within 20 minutes.

26:25.633 --> 26:27.900
--WELTON:
...you want the drip
to stay steady.

26:27.967 --> 26:31.067
Add in some glucose
after about an hour.

26:31.134 --> 26:32.267
If you see anything,
any movement,

26:32.334 --> 26:33.700
twitch of the
eyelids, you get me.

26:33.767 --> 26:35.867
Got it?

26:36.934 --> 26:38.500
Dr. Welton,

26:38.567 --> 26:39.900
I need to speak
with you.

26:39.967 --> 26:41.334
I don't have much time,
Ms. Hayes.

26:41.401 --> 26:43.301
What's the President's
condition?

26:43.368 --> 26:45.167
It's worsened
in the last 15 minutes.

26:45.234 --> 26:46.667
There was a buildup of

26:46.734 --> 26:47.667
intracranial pressure.

26:47.734 --> 26:48.900
We had to induce a coma

26:48.967 --> 26:50.134
to relieve the swelling.

26:50.201 --> 26:51.201
I see.

26:51.267 --> 26:52.834
Good news is
we stopped it in time.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.934
Doesn't seem to have been
any neural damage,

26:55.001 --> 26:57.234
and his vitals are
surprisingly strong.

26:57.301 --> 26:59.001
He's a fighter.

26:59.067 --> 27:00.834
We have that much going for us.
Excuse me.

27:00.900 --> 27:01.967
Doctor...

27:02.034 --> 27:03.334
Yes.

27:03.401 --> 27:05.767
Is there any way that you can

27:05.834 --> 27:07.368
bring the President
back to consciousness?

27:07.434 --> 27:10.167
I know this is an
unusual request,

27:10.234 --> 27:13.667
but it's a matter of national
security that I speak with him.

27:13.734 --> 27:15.101
I'm sorry.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.101
It could pose
a serious risk to his life.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.201
I couldn't possibly
authorize it.

27:18.267 --> 27:19.401
Who could?

27:19.468 --> 27:22.267
I'd need consent
from his family.

27:22.334 --> 27:23.834
His sister is here.

27:23.900 --> 27:26.700
But I would strongly
advise against it.

27:26.767 --> 27:28.067
If the swelling
isn't contained,

27:28.134 --> 27:31.401
the President could suffer
permanent brain damage.

27:31.468 --> 27:33.434
I have to go, Ms. Hayes.

28:03.967 --> 28:06.401
* *

28:12.500 --> 28:14.667
This is insane.

28:16.167 --> 28:18.167
Nadia can't be involved in this.

28:18.234 --> 28:20.533
The signal was routed
through her station.

28:20.600 --> 28:21.600
We can't ignore that fact.

28:21.667 --> 28:23.134
Do you really believe that Nadia

28:23.201 --> 28:25.500
is helping the terrorists?

28:25.567 --> 28:27.468
I don't want to believe it,
but I really don't know.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.134
Doyle's an ass.

28:31.201 --> 28:32.533
He's doing his job.

28:32.600 --> 28:34.600
If we want him to stop,
we have to prove she's innocent.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.834
Hello. Think I
got something.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.167
What is it?

28:40.234 --> 28:41.434
I've set up
a feedback pulse.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.101
Whoever Nadia's feeding
our data stream to

28:43.167 --> 28:45.101
will read it as some
static in the line,

28:45.167 --> 28:46.967
but we may be able
to ride the pulse

28:47.034 --> 28:48.867
back to its source, find
the location of the drone pilot.

28:48.934 --> 28:51.034
I've got it.

28:51.101 --> 28:53.001
1530 Hillcrest.

28:53.067 --> 28:54.134
Hillcrest, that's close.

28:54.201 --> 28:55.334
Bloody close--
three blocks away.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.967
Okay, tell Buchanan.

29:00.334 --> 29:02.767
I'm asking you once
again, cooperate.

29:02.834 --> 29:06.134
Help me put
an end to this.

29:07.967 --> 29:09.500
(sighs)

29:11.633 --> 29:14.001
(gasps)

29:14.067 --> 29:15.468
I'm warning you.

29:15.533 --> 29:19.468
I will do what's necessary
to get the answers I need.

29:19.533 --> 29:21.201
Do you understand?

29:21.267 --> 29:23.967
Do you understand?

29:25.867 --> 29:27.834
(gasping)

29:34.667 --> 29:36.401
I understand everything.

29:38.468 --> 29:40.134
I read your file.

29:40.201 --> 29:44.067
I know what you did in Denver.

29:44.134 --> 29:45.834
You enjoy hurting people.

29:45.900 --> 29:48.034
You get off on it.

29:48.101 --> 29:49.533
We're not here to talk about me.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.500
We're here to talk about

29:51.567 --> 29:53.667
what you know.

29:53.734 --> 29:57.500
I don't know anything!

29:57.567 --> 29:58.900
MILO:
Get away from
her, Doyle.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.234
I said let her go.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.134
What the hell
are you doing?

30:05.201 --> 30:06.867
We got the drone
pilot's location

30:06.934 --> 30:08.101
through Nadia's computer.

30:08.167 --> 30:10.533
Where is it?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.101
Three blocks from here.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.767
1530 Hillcrest.

30:17.633 --> 30:19.600
We're not through
with her, Milo.

30:24.134 --> 30:26.101
(gasps)

30:26.167 --> 30:28.934
Are you okay?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.034
Milo?

30:36.101 --> 30:39.767
You know I didn't have anything
to do with this.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.734
Get out of here.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.134
* *

31:49.700 --> 31:51.067
Agent, what's going on?

31:51.134 --> 31:52.700
We have a location
on the drone's pilot.

31:52.767 --> 31:54.434
We're mobilizing now.

31:59.767 --> 32:03.067
BUCHANAN:
As you know, whoever's
piloting the drone

32:03.134 --> 32:05.301
is operating in close
proximity to CTU.

32:05.368 --> 32:08.134
I'm instituting a level
one security lock-down.

32:08.201 --> 32:11.301
All provisional safeguards are
in effect until further notice.

32:11.368 --> 32:13.900
Let's go to work!

32:15.767 --> 32:18.434
Marcy...

32:18.500 --> 32:19.900
contact LAPD.

32:19.967 --> 32:21.368
Have them coordinate
with tactical.

32:21.434 --> 32:23.667
Seal off a perimeter.
Yes, sir.

32:24.967 --> 32:26.600
Chloe...

32:26.667 --> 32:27.867
have they confirmed
the address?

32:27.934 --> 32:29.167
Yes, it's a relay station.

32:29.234 --> 32:30.667
I've got the building
specs and layout.

32:30.734 --> 32:32.134
I'm gonna need a PDA
and a phone.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.667
I'll get them for you.
Thanks.

32:33.734 --> 32:35.401
Jack, what are you doing?

32:35.468 --> 32:38.067
I'm going with the team.

32:38.134 --> 32:40.368
You're injured.
You should be in medical.

32:40.434 --> 32:42.633
You should have told me
about Audrey, Bill.

32:45.633 --> 32:48.134
We were asking you to give
your life, Jack.

32:48.201 --> 32:50.434
I didn't think it
was right to tell you
about Audrey's accident.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.834
It wasn't an accident.
She was murdered.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.001
No one knows that for sure.

32:53.067 --> 32:55.034
I do.

32:55.101 --> 32:56.900
Bill, Audrey gave

32:56.967 --> 32:59.067
her life trying to get me
out of a Chinese prison

32:59.134 --> 33:01.101
because she thought
I was worth it.

33:01.167 --> 33:04.101
I'm not going to let
her die for nothing now.

33:04.167 --> 33:05.934
I'm going to finish this.

33:06.001 --> 33:07.967
And when I do,

33:08.034 --> 33:10.468
I'm gonna track down the people
responsible for her murder,

33:10.533 --> 33:12.734
and I'm going to take
care of them, too.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.734
Please, you have to
let me finish this.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.800
All right.

33:18.867 --> 33:21.567
I'll tell Doyle
you're running point.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.700
--The drone is approaching
the city.

33:41.767 --> 33:43.800
I'm beginning descent now.

33:43.867 --> 33:46.534
How long until the bomb
detonates?

33:46.600 --> 33:49.034
At its current speed,
the drone will reach

33:49.101 --> 33:51.667
the target perimeter
within three minutes.

33:51.733 --> 33:53.167
It will detonate automatically

33:53.234 --> 33:54.867
when it reaches
the perimeter line.

33:54.934 --> 33:57.967
I'll bring it in
at an altitude of 500 feet

33:58.034 --> 33:59.800
to achieve maximum damage.

33:59.867 --> 34:03.867
Don't worry, tovarish,
everything is set.

34:03.934 --> 34:06.934
It will happen exactly
as you planned.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.067
Concentrate on
the task at hand.

34:10.134 --> 34:11.568
Then call me when it's done.

34:11.632 --> 34:13.234
Yes, sir.

34:20.434 --> 34:22.733
Bill, it's Jack.
We're in position.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.934
The gate was open,
there's a utility truck

34:25.000 --> 34:26.333
parked behind the building.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.101
Our back-trace shows
the intrusion

34:28.167 --> 34:29.367
into our system is
coming from a room

34:29.434 --> 34:31.766
in the northwest corner
of the switching station.

34:31.833 --> 34:34.733
Jack, I'm looking at an updated
schematic now. Your most direct 

34:34.800 --> 34:36.900
route is through the rear
entrance, to the left.

34:36.967 --> 34:38.900
Okay. Did you get that?
Yeah.

34:38.967 --> 34:41.000
(grunts)
Do you want me
on point?

34:41.067 --> 34:42.699
I got it.

34:42.766 --> 34:43.934
Let's go.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.967
Whatever you say.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.633
(clattering)
What was that?

35:12.700 --> 35:14.667
Go check.

35:38.967 --> 35:40.301
(gunshot, groaning)

35:52.800 --> 35:55.468
Let's get a medic.

35:55.534 --> 35:57.067
Chloe, it's Jack.
Do you copy?

35:57.134 --> 35:57.934
We copy.

35:58.000 --> 35:58.967
Jack, what's your status?

35:59.034 --> 36:00.167
The drone pilot is down.

36:00.234 --> 36:01.568
I'm at his controls now.

36:01.633 --> 36:03.000
The target is
San Francisco.

36:03.067 --> 36:05.101
I repeat, the target
is San Francisco.

36:05.167 --> 36:07.134
Alert local law enforcement
and First Responders

36:07.201 --> 36:08.700
in the area, and
open a channel

36:08.767 --> 36:10.733
with the Regional Control
Center up there.
Got it.

36:14.468 --> 36:16.967
These controls are
for navigation only.

36:17.034 --> 36:18.067
There is no way

36:18.134 --> 36:19.468
to deactivate the
bomb remotely.

36:19.534 --> 36:21.367
CTU, we're linking you in now.
You should have it.

36:21.434 --> 36:22.501
It's coming through.

36:22.568 --> 36:24.501
Jack, is there any way
for you to determine

36:24.568 --> 36:26.267
what triggering
mechanism they're using?

36:26.334 --> 36:28.334
It looks like they wired
a GPS module into the bomb.

36:28.401 --> 36:30.201
It'll detonate as
soon as it crosses

36:30.267 --> 36:31.367
its designated
perimeter.

36:31.434 --> 36:32.867
I'm trying
to steer it away now.

36:32.934 --> 36:34.900
Don't turn the drone
too sharply,

36:34.967 --> 36:36.600
or it'll stall,
and you'll lose control.

36:36.667 --> 36:37.800
Copy that.

36:37.867 --> 36:38.967
On its current course,

36:39.034 --> 36:40.633
the drone will cross
the perimeter

36:40.700 --> 36:42.034
and detonate
in 30 seconds.

36:47.667 --> 36:49.600
Jack, you're getting
a stabilizer warning.

36:49.667 --> 36:50.700
I see it.

36:50.767 --> 36:52.733
20 seconds.

37:01.067 --> 37:02.633
Ten seconds.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.767
Okay, it's turning.

37:10.134 --> 37:13.534
The drone did not
cross the perimeter.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.700
I'm fighting a stall.

37:14.767 --> 37:15.934
I'm losing control
of the drone.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I need to find a
place to land it now.

37:18.067 --> 37:20.301
All right, according
to the specs,

37:20.367 --> 37:22.568
it's gonna need 500 feet
of runway to land.

37:22.633 --> 37:24.700
Okay, closest to the drone's
current position,

37:24.767 --> 37:26.501
there's a long stretch
of residential road

37:26.568 --> 37:28.134
straight ahead of you.

37:28.201 --> 37:30.501
That's a negative. Find me
an area that's unpopulated.

37:30.568 --> 37:31.900
Hold on.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.767
If you can get
the drone farther east,

37:37.834 --> 37:39.600
there's an industrial
park along the Bay.

37:39.667 --> 37:41.067
I'm uploading
the coordinates now.

37:41.134 --> 37:44.134
Have Regional Command deploy
units to the area immediately.

37:44.201 --> 37:45.568
Regional Command...

37:45.633 --> 37:47.667
Come on.

38:03.034 --> 38:05.101
(engine whooshing)

38:12.000 --> 38:13.067
The drone is down.

38:18.767 --> 38:20.700
(clanking)

38:30.733 --> 38:32.934
MORRIS: Mr. Buchanan,
none of the First
Responders in San Francisco

38:33.000 --> 38:34.700
are reporting a detonation.
The bomb did not

38:34.767 --> 38:35.800
go off on impact.

38:35.867 --> 38:38.267
Jack, did you copy that?
Yeah.

38:38.334 --> 38:41.000
Can we get a visual
from anyone at the site?

38:41.067 --> 38:43.201
I'm showing a fire
and rescue unit already

38:43.267 --> 38:45.568
arriving at the scene.

38:45.633 --> 38:47.334
What's the status on the pilot?

38:47.401 --> 38:48.867
He's alive, barely.

38:48.934 --> 38:50.900
Do whatever you have to
to get him conscious.

38:53.967 --> 38:55.934
(sirens blaring)

39:03.501 --> 39:05.733
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:05.800 --> 39:07.767
(beeping)

39:09.700 --> 39:11.967
Get the Geiger counter.
(beeping continues)

39:19.434 --> 39:21.234
(static crackling)

39:24.067 --> 39:25.900
(crackling continues,
then ceases)

39:25.967 --> 39:27.967
Move out! There's radioactive

39:28.034 --> 39:30.267
material in this area!
Pull back

39:30.334 --> 39:32.667
and wait for HAZMAT.
Move it!

39:55.401 --> 39:57.434
Sir,

39:57.501 --> 40:00.501
I have Bill Buchanan
on line one.

40:01.568 --> 40:03.000
Bill, what do you have?

40:03.067 --> 40:04.501
Mr. Vice President,

40:04.568 --> 40:06.600
the drone was intercepted
before the nuclear bomb

40:06.667 --> 40:08.667
was able to detonate.
Oh, thank God.

40:08.733 --> 40:10.000
Congratulations, sir.

40:10.067 --> 40:13.201
We were able to take control
of the aircraft,

40:13.267 --> 40:14.800
crash-landing it
in an industrial park

40:14.867 --> 40:16.067
at the edge of the city.

40:16.134 --> 40:17.800
But in the process,

40:17.867 --> 40:19.501
the bomb's nuclear
core was compromised,

40:19.568 --> 40:22.201
and radioactive
material was released.

40:22.267 --> 40:23.401
So what we're essentially

40:23.468 --> 40:25.000
dealing with is a dirty bomb.

40:25.067 --> 40:27.000
Sir, this was not
a dispersal device.

40:27.067 --> 40:28.468
It was a radiological spill.

40:28.534 --> 40:30.900
It was an attack
on our nation.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.301
Bill, are there casualties?

40:36.367 --> 40:38.534
Local Responders
got there before HAZMAT.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.767
They were almost
certainly exposed

40:39.834 --> 40:42.367
to fatal doses of
radiation, but so far,

40:42.434 --> 40:44.134
it appears that
radioactive material

40:44.201 --> 40:45.534
was not widely dispersed.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.401
Casualties should
be minimal.

40:48.468 --> 40:50.934
At least we've got that to be
grateful for. Thanks, Bill.

41:00.633 --> 41:02.767
Proceed with the warning strike
as planned.

41:02.834 --> 41:05.067
Sir, the primary
attack was averted.

41:05.134 --> 41:07.401
CTU was successful.

41:07.468 --> 41:10.000
There will be civilian
deaths, as well as untold

41:10.067 --> 41:11.301
environmental damage.

41:11.367 --> 41:13.401
I hardly consider
that a success.

41:13.468 --> 41:15.167
The damage will be minimal

41:15.234 --> 41:17.234
compared to what
we just avoided.

41:17.301 --> 41:19.501
Sir, I think we should
consider ourselves fortunate.

41:19.568 --> 41:21.501
Tom?

41:21.568 --> 41:23.568
Sir?

41:23.633 --> 41:26.800
Mr. Vice President,
we were led to believe
that this warning shot

41:26.867 --> 41:29.367
would be fired
only in response

41:29.434 --> 41:31.867
to the detonation
of a nuclear device.

41:31.934 --> 41:34.367
That is a technicality, Tom.

41:35.834 --> 41:37.867
I gave fair warning
to the Prime Minister,

41:37.934 --> 41:39.733
and I intend to carry it out.

41:43.267 --> 41:44.401
Secretary Kanin?

41:44.468 --> 41:47.101
How long will
it take to move

41:47.167 --> 41:49.034
the submarine
into position?

41:49.101 --> 41:51.401
Once you've given the order...

41:51.468 --> 41:53.468
within the hour.

41:55.967 --> 41:57.301
The order is given.

41:57.367 --> 41:59.834
Launch the missile...

42:01.000 --> 42:03.134
...as soon as they're in range.

42:03.134 --> 42:08.134
