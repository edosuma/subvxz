00:10.378 --> 00:11.545
<i>As of tonight,
everybody gonna know</i>

00:11.545 --> 00:12.646
<i>who the 50 Boyz are.</i>

00:12.646 --> 00:13.647
Do you brothers ever do

00:13.647 --> 00:15.683

like hug?

00:16.450 --> 00:17.518
Man, shut the fuck up.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.322
I see y'all over here
holding it down.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.724
If you're ever over
in the Brewsters, get that K-9.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.459
These are the biggest earners
in my stable.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.794
Nice to meet y'all, man.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.063
<i>That's my wife, Markisha.</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:34.568
We can't say how well his eye
is going to heal right now.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.238
If my son is seeing
anything other than 20/20

00:37.238 --> 00:39.507
when this is done,
you're looking at a lawsuit.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.709
Hey, old head,
why the sudden change of heart?

00:41.709 --> 00:42.810
I want the king
of these streets

00:43.043 --> 00:44.612
to actually come from Ecorse.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.380
You want us to fall back

00:46.380 --> 00:48.249
<i>while old school work
his magic?</i>

00:48.249 --> 00:50.151
Look, we need to talk
about this motherfucker Lamar

00:50.151 --> 00:51.519
right now.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.586
Here I go, nigga.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.821
Get to stepping, nigga.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
Nigga, fuck you,
charcoal-ass nigga.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.758
Ruffle his feathers.
Nothing else.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.560
I ain't shoot him, man.

00:59.560 --> 01:00.694
I didn't do it, man--

01:01.429 --> 01:02.463
What the fuck
did you do that for?

01:02.463 --> 01:03.697
I did something you wouldn't.

01:03.697 --> 01:05.332
Jay-Mo was dragged out
the Detroit River today

01:05.332 --> 01:06.534
<i>with a bullet in his head.</i>

01:06.534 --> 01:07.601
I got a little extra for you

01:07.601 --> 01:09.170
for your inconvenience.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.505
This here? Also done.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.611
Detective Lopez sustained

01:17.611 --> 01:19.647
a massive brain hemorrhage
from head trauma.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.081
<i>I'm sorry.
He didn't make it.</i>

01:21.081 --> 01:22.683
If you'd like to help,
then help.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.385
I don't know how
your partner got killed.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.587
Give your mom my condolences.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.788
<i>Want to tell me
why I just saw</i>

01:27.788 --> 01:29.790
Lamar's crazy ass
leaving my house?

01:29.790 --> 01:31.459
I've been working for Lamar.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.094
If Terry keeps doing what he's
doing, he's gonna end up dead.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.263
And right now,
you are enabling him.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.865
I need you to stop.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.700
- Where you going?
- Terry Jr. and I

01:39.700 --> 01:41.268
are gonna go live
with my cousin

01:41.268 --> 01:42.736
in Pennsylvania
for a few months.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.406
Our business is expanding,
but we need more product.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.208
I don't do business
with you, Meech.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.342
<i>Back, motherfucker.</i>

01:50.177 --> 01:51.612
You think we actually
give a fuck

01:51.612 --> 01:53.280
about a rat bitch
working for you?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.785
Did you shoot
my fuckin' brother?

02:00.387 --> 02:02.223
<i>I love you.</i>

02:03.257 --> 02:04.325
<i>I love you too, boo.</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:07.194
Pulled that from your car.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.729
Our ballistics
connected your gun

02:08.729 --> 02:10.231
to the murders
of Katherine Eder

02:10.231 --> 02:11.499
<i>and James Williams.</i>

02:11.499 --> 02:13.467
I want Meech, or I'ma make sure

02:13.467 --> 02:15.202
<i>that you eat
both these charges.</i>

02:15.202 --> 02:18.272
After fees, you'll be in
the neighborhood of $150,000.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.340
<i>I'm out.</i>

02:19.340 --> 02:21.141
Me and Pops are starting
a car service.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.244
After everything
we've been through to get here?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.378
You're doing this now?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.514

03:43.390 --> 03:44.425
Hang on, Roost.

03:44.425 --> 03:46.393
After tonight,

03:46.393 --> 03:48.562
some of us might not see
each other for a while.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.566
But I want all of y'all to know
we family no matter what.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.401
Sometimes families

<i>Oh, damn!</i>

<i>We didn't even do shit.</i>

Shut the fuck up.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.425
Who winning the game?

04:18.425 --> 04:19.660
Don't matter.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.296
Your ass is always
too uncoordinated to play.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.832
You just wasted 20 years
chasing me.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.600
And for what?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.436
Your life's ruined,

04:40.314 --> 04:41.915

04:43.784 --> 04:45.653
Who the fuck
is that Black bitch?

04:45.653 --> 04:48.055
Come on. Your mama taught you
not to use language like that.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.990
Yeah, and that Black bitch
is the one

04:49.990 --> 04:52.292
that's gonna give you and your
brother that family reunion

04:52.292 --> 04:53.460
you've been asking for.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.662
And that gray sweat suit

04:54.662 --> 04:56.664
is gonna bring out the color
in your good eye.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.399
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.436
Enjoy jail, criminal.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.372
Good work, man.

05:05.372 --> 05:07.875
Goddamn right, it was.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.314
<i>Lock up!</i>

05:14.314 --> 05:15.716
<i>Moms always said,</i>

05:15.716 --> 05:18.919
<i>"Can't nobody ride to freedom
on a Pharaoh's chariot,"</i>

05:18.919 --> 05:22.723
<i>which means you can't outrun
your past or the heat.</i>

05:22.723 --> 05:25.025
<i>Meech knew that,
which is why he always</i>

05:25.025 --> 05:27.995
<i>threw caution to the wind
and dollars in the air.</i>

05:27.995 --> 05:29.663
<i>He got arrested first.</i>

05:29.663 --> 05:31.765
<i>I always thought
I was smarter.</i>

05:31.765 --> 05:34.435
<i>And for the longest time,
I was.</i>

05:34.435 --> 05:35.903
<i>And then I wasn't.</i>

05:35.903 --> 05:38.105
<i>Hey, make sure you
strap that shit on tight, man.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:39.740
I ain't trying to get stopped
by one time.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.109
Hurry the fuck up.
Fight starts in a halfie.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.744
Got a lot of money on Hagler.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.112
Man, fuck that
bald-headed motherfucker.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.714
- Don't be rushing me for him.
- <i>Why?</i>

05:46.714 --> 05:49.349
<i>'Cause he beat Tommy Hearns,
the Motor City Cobra?</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:51.351
Hell no.
I'm pressed for time,

05:51.351 --> 05:52.619
and I need to get
this work back.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.722
There's value to working hard
and playing hard.

05:54.722 --> 05:55.856
Especially in this.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.058
Yo, Earl, you know you talking

05:58.058 --> 06:00.027
to one of the biggest players
in Detroit, right?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.795
<i>Then why you cutting out
one of the biggest events</i>

06:01.795 --> 06:03.430
the streets has to offer?

06:03.430 --> 06:04.665
'Cause I'm 'bout my paper, nigga.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.109
Let me put you up on game.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.580
<i>That's Rayful Edmond
and the D.C. boys.</i>

06:21.782 --> 06:23.784
<i>That's Freeway Rick
and his crew from LA.</i>

06:25.986 --> 06:28.789
Who them Bob Marley looking
motherfuckers over there?

06:28.789 --> 06:31.091
<i>That's Chris Coke
and the Jamaican posse.</i>

06:32.493 --> 06:34.661
Coming to the fights
ain't about boxing.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.163
It's about flexing.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.666
NBA All-Star Game,
Caribana, and Freaknik

06:39.666 --> 06:40.934
are where the big boys
come out.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.870
There's where
the real business happens.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.072
So while you worrying
about getting back to the D,

06:45.072 --> 06:47.074
they out here
running the world,

06:47.074 --> 06:48.942
and we all come to show out.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.613
If you ain't here,
you ain't made it yet.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.914
So you gotta shine
like new money

06:53.914 --> 06:55.983
in order to make mo' money.
Okay.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.685
If you ever out in Atlanta
and you really want to talk,

06:58.685 --> 06:59.720
give me a shout.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.637
<i>Everybody played
cops and robbers growing up.</i>

07:16.637 --> 07:19.039
<i>But in the streets,
that shit ain't no game.</i>

07:19.039 --> 07:21.175
<i>It's a motherfuckin' ethos.</i>

07:21.175 --> 07:22.743
<i>We'd get slick with the work,</i>

07:22.743 --> 07:24.912
<i>and one-time got slicker
with their tactics,</i>

07:24.912 --> 07:27.181
<i>adding drug dogs and shit
to the mix.</i>

07:30.184 --> 07:31.985
<i>If we didn't stay
a step ahead,</i>

07:31.985 --> 07:33.854
<i>we would have became
that bite out of crime</i>

07:33.854 --> 07:35.055
<i>McGruff was always after.</i>

07:35.055 --> 07:36.690
<i>One way to Detroit.</i>

07:38.058 --> 07:39.459
<i>This ain't no fairy tale</i>

07:39.459 --> 07:41.161
<i>about good versus evil.</i>

07:41.161 --> 07:44.698
<i>Out in the wild,
it's hunter and prey.</i>

07:44.698 --> 07:46.667
<i>To survive, Meech and I
had to learn</i>

07:46.667 --> 07:49.803
<i>to be the baddest beasts

I'm-I'm sorry.
My pencil broke.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.888
So I was asking

09:47.888 --> 09:49.890
Sorry, but I'm gonna
have to grade your test as-is.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.258
Yo, come on.
You-you can't do that.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.893
- I'm not done yet.
- That's not my problem.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.895
Rules apply to everyone,
including you.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.164
Oh my...
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.166
- Yo. Hey, yo--
- Fuck outta here.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.849
- Lucille.
- Hey.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.718
- Did you want it?
- You ate it already.

10:17.718 --> 10:18.952
You don't never eat
the second donut.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.187
That don't mean
you shouldn't ask me.

10:25.225 --> 10:27.260
That should have been us.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.366
Yeah.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.270
You know, when me and Terry
get the sedan service up,

10:37.270 --> 10:39.139
I'ma take you
to Carl's Chop House,

10:39.139 --> 10:40.907
and I'ma sing to you every day.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.212
After I get that console
I got put on layaway.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.646
Oh, okay.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.219
You give Nicole
her lunch money?

10:52.219 --> 10:54.788
Yeah, but that still
ain't enough.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.356
I mean, she's spilling
out of all her bras.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.924
She needs new clothes.

10:57.924 --> 10:58.959
Can we please talk
about something else

10:58.959 --> 11:00.127
besides the kids and money?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.095
What you want to talk about?

11:11.271 --> 11:13.874
Well, we better get on the road
before we both late.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.016
What is up with that suit?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.918
This ain't no damn
Prince video, nigga.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.854
The fuck you talkin' 'bout?
I look good.

11:27.854 --> 11:31.892
Good morning.
Our daily recap is as follows.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.294
The turf war between 50 Boyz
and 12th Street

11:34.294 --> 11:37.230
<i>has escalated,
resulting in multiple murders,</i>

11:37.230 --> 11:40.934
including
Detective Jonathan Lopez.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.702
<i>Now, Bryant
has tracked down a lead</i>

11:42.702 --> 11:43.937
<i>and found the murder weapon.</i>

11:43.937 --> 11:45.338
<i>Care to do the honors?</i>

11:45.338 --> 11:49.242
All right.
Forensics came back.

11:49.242 --> 11:52.946
Prints lifted from this
belong to a Katherine Eder,

11:52.946 --> 11:56.016
<i>street name Kato,
known 50 Boyz slinger.</i>

11:56.016 --> 11:58.351
A mud print at the scene
also matched up

11:58.351 --> 12:01.221
with a shoe at her residence,
so case closed.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.824
So Eder and Silas were rivals,

12:03.824 --> 12:05.158
and they were both gunned down?

12:06.326 --> 12:09.262
Uh, yeah,
outside the Visger Bar.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.064
The investigation
remains active.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.365
Public place,
plenty of witnesses,

12:12.365 --> 12:13.800
and nobody's talking.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.135
Fucking typical.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.204
Suspects were shot
with two different guns,

12:17.204 --> 12:19.239
still out on the streets.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.240
My manners.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.976
This is Detective Veronica Jin

12:22.976 --> 12:24.744
<i>joining us from Southfield.</i>

12:24.744 --> 12:26.079
<i>Today is her first day,</i>

12:26.079 --> 12:28.014
<i>so let's give her
a warm welcome.</i>

12:28.014 --> 12:31.017
<i>Your new partner, Bryant here,
can catch you up to speed.</i>

12:31.017 --> 12:32.385
Bodies will continue to drop

12:32.385 --> 12:35.188
unless we get these dealers
off the streets.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.091
Get to it. Let's go.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.228
Uh, Amanda, look here.

12:41.228 --> 12:44.397
I don't want to babysit
some new detective

12:44.397 --> 12:47.501
that came to Detroit
to get their street cred.

12:47.501 --> 12:51.471
Jin's a hard charger vet
who comes highly recommended.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.541
You want to sit on the bench
or get in the game?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.293
I can't even see shit.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.461
We might as well just bounce.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.029
And go do what exactly?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.064
Chauffer my 50 bones
to the bank.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.499
All right, you got
a higher score than me,

13:19.499 --> 13:22.002
but I still passed,
so I don't give a fuck.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.475
Oh, shit, man.

13:36.950 --> 13:40.120
Damn! Ruin me, baby girl.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.122

Why'd you leave Southfield?

18:05.718 --> 18:07.787
I got promoted.

18:07.787 --> 18:10.523
Everybody says
it was affirmative action.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.326

18:32.178 --> 18:34.380

Chinatown was still around.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.182
And then they started
displacing us

<i>And the other half,
I'm nauseous</i>

19:31.604 --> 19:32.939
<i>from the stank-ass cologne
you wear.</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:34.207
<i>I don't understand.</i>

19:38.411 --> 19:40.246
I save your life

19:40.246 --> 19:41.814
and this my thanks?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.316
<i>You disrespecting me?</i>

19:44.417 --> 19:48.388
Yo, Rayzin, get this Colombian
cocksucker out my face

19:48.388 --> 19:49.589
'fore I go the fuck off.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.225
Vámonos, Sina. Adios.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.566
Keep your nose clean, pendejo.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.370
Baby, you really
shouldn't be so mean.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.638
Fuck Sina.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.409
Feeling the music, Meech?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.344
No doubt. It's soulful.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.949
Babe, didn't Jackie Wilson
get his start here?

20:15.949 --> 20:19.452
Yeah, and Berry Gordy
used to sell Polaroids

20:19.452 --> 20:21.521
of all the guests up here
before he started Motown.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.389
- Hell yeah.
- Let's talk shop.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.491
My brother said you and Tee
move shit faster

20:25.491 --> 20:27.427
- than anybody in D.
- Hell yeah.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.761
We used to play hot potatoes
growing up.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.930
So we just applied it
to the game as well.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.899
By the time 5-0 hear
we got some work,

20:32.899 --> 20:34.567
man, we already be cashing out.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.269
Oh.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.870
I ain't get caught
in Vegas either.

20:42.842 --> 20:43.977
Except you're late.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.478
There were drug dogs
at the airport,

20:45.478 --> 20:47.013
so I had to improvise
and think on the fly.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
<i>But I may have found a more
efficient way to transport.</i>

20:50.249 --> 20:51.918
And I wear size 12 in Guccis, nigga.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.854
Look, K-9, I'm the buyer.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.289
You the seller.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.724
I got the weight.
You got the money.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.759
All right, what up?

20:59.759 --> 21:00.960
You think I need
your scrawny ass

21:00.960 --> 21:02.829
<i>or this bitch-ass load
you just hauled?</i>

21:02.829 --> 21:06.265
Look, K-9, I'm not trying
to disrespect you, a'ight?

21:06.265 --> 21:07.834
You're one of the only cats
in the D

21:07.834 --> 21:10.003
with a steady supply
from a Colombian connect.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.771
<i>I did what you asked,
and you know who I am.</i>

21:11.771 --> 21:13.039
So what's crackin'?

21:13.272 --> 21:15.341
It's more to this
than dollars and cents, Meech.

21:15.341 --> 21:16.509
The people who get ahead
in this game

21:16.509 --> 21:18.645
do it off the bonds they make.

21:18.645 --> 21:21.414
And that's built off
honesty and loyalty.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.684
<i>Shit you can't see,
smell, or touch.</i>

21:25.551 --> 21:26.919
You just gotta feel it.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.759
There's a pretty lady
here to see you.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.398
- Good lookin', Unc.
- What's up, K-9?

21:38.398 --> 21:39.866
<i>- You good?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

21:41.534 --> 21:44.704
Nothin' like listenin'
to the blues, so I guess I am.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.372
You know Peaches.

21:46.372 --> 21:48.307
That's Meech.
That's Big L.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.009
We already know each other.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.978
He's a great salesman.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.047
I just wasn't sold.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.716
Anyway, it's nice seeing you.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.519
Maybe next time
we won't take this long.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.926
If she don't fuck with you,
then why should I?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.429
Man, that bitch
was threatened by flash

22:09.429 --> 22:12.532
and didn't get that my glow
makes everybody shine brighter.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.703
Maybe I'll be in touch.

22:16.703 --> 22:17.737
Maybe I won't.

22:19.372 --> 22:20.540
Let's go, baby.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.431
Baby, it's 3:00 in the morning.

22:45.431 --> 22:46.799
Yeah.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.901
I want you round the clock, woman.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.871
Okay. Not tonight, okay, babe?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.639
Come on now.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.709
Baby, please.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.378
I have to be up in three hours.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.481
We ain't been together
in over three weeks.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.416
God...

23:09.055 --> 23:10.389
Let's go to sleep.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.558
I'll get you
another time, okay?

23:58.437 --> 24:00.139
That don't look like oatmeal
to me.

24:00.139 --> 24:04.010
Well, no, but it is a Pop-Tart
and peanut butter sandwich,

24:04.010 --> 24:06.979
and it does cover
all the basic four food groups.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.448
Well, since I bought it,
I'ma eat it too.

24:10.716 --> 24:11.717
Okay.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.120
Let's try this.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.791
Oh, God. Much better.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.760
<i>Go and make that oatmeal
like I said.</i>

24:20.760 --> 24:22.495
Worth a shot.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.796
Hold up.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.766
So busy making this nasty
Pop-Tart sandwich,

24:26.766 --> 24:28.100
you buttoned
your shirt up wrong.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.636
Let me get that.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.838
Kevin, what is this?

24:31.838 --> 24:34.473
Well, that's Bruiser,
the superhero I created.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.810
He's like a mix of Superman
and the Brown Hornet

24:37.810 --> 24:38.978
rolled all into one.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.580
Ill, right?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.581
That's really impressive,

24:41.581 --> 24:42.882
but son,

24:42.882 --> 24:45.117
I don't think this
is appropriate for high school.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.086
Come on, Dad.

24:47.086 --> 24:49.021
Even Mom wouldn't be
stressing me out this much.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.223
Well, your mom's
not in charge anymore.

24:50.223 --> 24:51.624
I am.

24:51.624 --> 24:53.092
She gave up that right
in court, remember?

24:54.861 --> 24:56.863
Okay. Okay, fine.

24:56.863 --> 25:00.233
But can I just please wear it
as an undershirt?

25:00.233 --> 25:02.835
- I-I really need it.
- Why?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.537
That kid still bothering you
in school?

25:05.771 --> 25:07.740
Well, I mean...

25:10.209 --> 25:13.613
Okay. You can wear it.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.782
But you don't have to pretend
to be a superhero.

25:16.782 --> 25:19.285
Your dad is the toughest dude
in the city,

25:19.518 --> 25:22.622
which means that you have that
in your blood.

25:22.622 --> 25:27.627
So if we connect your brain
with our blood line,

25:27.627 --> 25:29.595
you don't have to be afraid
of anything.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.865
You understand?

25:32.865 --> 25:34.734
Good.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.102
I love you, son.

25:36.102 --> 25:37.737
Love you, too, Dad.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.905
Okay.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.673
Now go and make that oatmeal
like I said.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.908
Have to bulk you up
a little bit.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.247

25:59.558 --> 26:01.827
Hey, DJ Can't Scratch.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.163
Can you chill and just
let that shit ride out?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.865
Man, smell these balls, motherfucker.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.803
Yo. Word of advice.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.005
Cut that shit.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.074
Man, what these bitch ass
niggas doing in here?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.642
That's funny
coming from a nigga

26:16.642 --> 26:18.978
who could turn sideways
in the shower and not get wet.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.680
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.815
Well, fuck you, you
Re-run looking motherfucker.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.051
- Oh, shit!
- Get him, nigga.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.286
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Get him.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.626
Hey, hey, hey.
Y'all niggas better recognize.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.161
Recognize what, motherfucker?

26:35.161 --> 26:38.297
Fuck off me.
Fuck off me. Come on.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.299
- Goddamn.
- Get his ass, D!

26:40.299 --> 26:41.934
What the fuck?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.169
Nigga, chill the fuck out, man.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.271
Chill the fuck out!

26:45.271 --> 26:47.740
Fuck is y'all in here doing,
man, tearing shit up, nigga?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.108
Man, these niggas
came up in our spot.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.643
'Cause I called 'em here, dummy.

26:50.643 --> 26:54.213
Now, listen, I want all of us
to combine our resources

26:54.213 --> 26:56.716
and make more money than we
ever fuckin' made before.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.851
But if y'all niggas want
to keep sitting here arguing

26:58.851 --> 27:01.687
and fighting like bitches,
y'all can get out.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.990
So what's this grand
master plan of yours?

27:03.990 --> 27:06.726
It's simple.
Lamar is dead.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.861
So now all we gotta do
is pool our resources.

27:08.861 --> 27:11.263
With what? Lent, motherfucker?

27:11.263 --> 27:15.401
'Cause word is you ain't got
no product and no plug.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.337
Nigga, I'm giving you
my motherfuckin' word, nigga.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.107
It's a lock
on an unlimited supply.

27:21.107 --> 27:23.709
- The best shit ever.
- Then what's the holdup?

27:27.079 --> 27:29.281
Meech ass always
selling wolf tickets.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.817
He better get his ducks
lined up,

27:31.817 --> 27:34.653
or we ain't coming back
up here no more.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.757
- I'ma see you, B-Mick.
- I'ma fuck you up.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.025
Yeah, it's gonna be
a bullet next time,

27:39.025 --> 27:40.159
you round motherfucker.

27:50.202 --> 27:51.837
How the hell I'm supposed
to know what's going on

27:51.837 --> 27:53.005
if you ain't never
told me shit?

27:53.005 --> 27:55.674
Nigga, we going after K-9,

27:55.674 --> 27:57.676
the biggest fish in the pond.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.345
We got to have our shit tight.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.060
Welcome to Wendy's.
How can I help you?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.229
Meechie.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.331
I was having a bad day,
but I came by to see you

28:19.331 --> 28:21.367
'cause I knew you was gonna
put a smile on my face.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.736
That is so sweet.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.204
How you been, Mama?

28:25.204 --> 28:28.474
You know, complaining
would be blasphemy.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.409
But, you know,

28:30.409 --> 28:32.211
your sister
is just wearing me out

28:32.211 --> 28:33.379
with that mouth of hers.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.282
Well, Nikki ain't
no little girl no more.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.284
I know.

28:38.284 --> 28:41.353
You know, your brother just got
his chauffeur's license,

28:41.353 --> 28:43.789
and we're gonna have dinner
on Sunday night to celebrate.

28:43.789 --> 28:45.124
I want you there.

28:46.325 --> 28:48.928
How you think Pops
gonna feel about that, Ma?

28:48.928 --> 28:50.062
It's his house.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.164
I just want to respect him, Mama.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.499
I didn't really understand it
back then,

28:53.732 --> 28:54.767
but I damn sure do now.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.836
Watch your mouth.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.804
I'm sorry. Here.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.442
Take this, Mama. Please.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.312
I can't do that, Meech.

29:09.315 --> 29:11.217
Here you go, baby.

29:11.217 --> 29:12.751
Thank you.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.788
I want to see you
on Sunday, okay?

29:15.788 --> 29:18.891
- I'ma try to make it.
- Don't try. Be there.

29:18.891 --> 29:22.294
- Love you.
- Love you more.

29:25.531 --> 29:27.233
Of course.
All right, have a good day.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.004
Sir, I can help you over here.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.780
Hey. You remember me?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.982
I saw you at
the Saint yesterday.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.050
We also met at Cub Taboo--
was a while back.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.153
I used to be one of Pat's
top earners, Terry.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.289
How can I help you, sir?

29:50.289 --> 29:51.857
I need to be added
to the insurance

29:51.857 --> 29:52.925
for my sedan business.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.026
Oh. Okay.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.194
So I just need you
to fill this out,

29:55.194 --> 29:57.129
provide me with
your business tax ID,

29:57.129 --> 29:59.899
and I'll get everything filed.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.233
Long night, huh?

30:01.233 --> 30:04.570
Nah, I just need the shades
to look at you, sunshine.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.472
Just fill this form out
and get it back to me.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.040
Was there anything else?

30:09.275 --> 30:11.010
It's just real nice
to catch up with you.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.945
Well, I work on commission,
so the longer I talk to you,

30:12.945 --> 30:14.013
the less money I make.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.514
- Next.
- Don't even trip.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.016
I'ma-I'ma make sure

30:17.016 --> 30:18.384
that I send a bunch
of customers your way.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.586
All right, Terry.
Have a good day.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.021
Just call me Tee.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.289
I'm gonna call you
by your government.

30:23.289 --> 30:24.423
All right. That works.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.858
Whatever you want to call me, just...

30:25.858 --> 30:27.526
- <i>Terry.</i>
- You call me. Call me.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.330
Hi, how are you?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.499
Okay, let me see.

30:33.499 --> 30:35.067
Perfect.

30:41.574 --> 30:43.842
What you thinkin' 'bout?

30:43.842 --> 30:47.012
Terry, Terry, look at me.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.186
<i>♪ Oh, sittin' thinking 'bout ♪</i>

30:54.186 --> 30:56.288
<i>♪ How lucky a man I am ♪</i>

30:56.288 --> 30:59.558
- You.
- Aw.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.628
You happy
me and Terry Jr. are back?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.130
Yeah. Hell yeah.

31:05.130 --> 31:09.435
The sound of him sleeping
at night is everything.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.104
You know I'm proud of you,
right, Tee?

31:12.104 --> 31:16.442
For gettin' out the game
and putting your family first.

31:16.442 --> 31:19.545
Meech ain't really
fuckin' with me, though.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.613
Probably 'cause
you took his bed

31:20.613 --> 31:22.114
and made this ghetto-ass king.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.517
It's better than my big ass
rolling around

31:25.517 --> 31:27.386
in that little tight-ass twin.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.955
Shit, you ain't never lie.

31:31.423 --> 31:35.261
I was thinking,
we should start a college fund

31:35.261 --> 31:40.032
for Terry Jr.,
move in, just the three of us.

31:40.032 --> 31:43.402
Yo, Wanda, you just took
our son and ran off.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.437
Now you back
with all these plans?

31:45.437 --> 31:47.273
I'ma need a minute.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.610
So what, we starting over?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.347
Yep.

31:56.949 --> 31:58.417
Nikki and Mama's
at Bible study,

31:58.417 --> 32:00.419
so we starting over right now.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.988
<i>♪ You're so lovely ♪</i>

32:02.988 --> 32:04.290
<i>♪ I love it ♪</i>

32:13.999 --> 32:15.267
Hey. That's not yours.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.535
For this not to be your car,

32:16.535 --> 32:18.404
you sure like
putting stuff in it.

32:18.404 --> 32:21.373
Somebody's starting to feel
real comfy on the job.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.375
My family believes
in the power of Buddha,

32:23.375 --> 32:26.045
and that charm is
for good luck and prosperity.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.279
Well, you got Buddha,

32:27.279 --> 32:29.048
I got Jesus,
and Muslims got Allah.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.949
It's all the same shit
when you get down to it.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.519
You must be fun at parties.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.354
Well, what do we have here?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.656
<i>Couple of 50 Boyz.</i>

32:41.493 --> 32:43.362
I got the tall, skinny one.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.179
Sucker-ass cops.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.125
Freeze right there, asshole.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.793
My tooth!

33:48.026 --> 33:50.028
This bitch hit me
with her fuckin' car!

33:50.028 --> 33:52.731
I'm sorry.
Were you saying something?

33:55.534 --> 33:57.136
Fucker almost ran into Buddha.

33:58.604 --> 34:02.040
Ooh. Mm.

34:03.308 --> 34:04.710
Just for the record,

34:04.710 --> 34:07.146
you're way more fun at parties
than me.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.247
Come on.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.820
Fuck you!

34:18.056 --> 34:20.192
I'll get all of this filed,
and I'll get back to you.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.260
Thanks.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.101
You were supposed to be
bringing me customers.

34:29.101 --> 34:30.636
Hey, look,
they definitely comin',

34:30.636 --> 34:32.237
but your orchid
was on its last leg,

34:32.237 --> 34:34.239
so I figured
I'd get you a fresh one.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.775
Oh, that's nice, but I can't--

34:36.775 --> 34:38.844
See, orchids are high
maintenance and temperamental.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.546
They gotta be treated
just right.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.114
The beauty and joy they bring

34:42.114 --> 34:44.550
outweighs the upkeep
and expense.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.253
Ouch. Oh, okay.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.223
Well, at least
just water the old one

34:51.223 --> 34:52.758
for photosynthesis and shit.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.561
Photosynthesis
is about light, silly.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.662
I know. I know.

34:56.662 --> 34:59.331
I was just seeing
if you was listening.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.700
- All right. Yeah.
- Bye, Terry.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.777
Dink got fucked up moving
the money from the stash house.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.612
What? Come on, man.

35:13.612 --> 35:15.614
He ain't gonna talk.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.383
That nigga ain't gonna talk.
But that green good as gone.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.489
Fuck it, man.
It's just part of the game.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.591
But how the hell
we gonna go cop from K-9 now?

35:25.591 --> 35:26.792
I don't know.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.494
Maybe we should think
outside of the box.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.129
You know what's crazy?

35:31.129 --> 35:32.865
That motherfucker spun
some shit to me other day

35:32.865 --> 35:35.501
that really didn't make sense
until now.

35:35.501 --> 35:38.170
Dope game ain't just
about dollars and cents

35:38.170 --> 35:40.272
as much as relationships.

35:40.272 --> 35:41.573
I gotta show that motherfucker

35:41.573 --> 35:43.475
I'm somebody
he can't afford to lose.

35:43.475 --> 35:44.743
What the hell you gonna do?

35:46.512 --> 35:49.281
I'm just gonna be me,
like I always do.

35:57.289 --> 35:59.525

and the tenth best?

36:33.825 --> 36:37.429
Ball handling skills,
orchestrating offense,

36:37.429 --> 36:38.931
probably leading the team
around him better.

36:38.931 --> 36:39.965
Vision.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.967
They have to see
the entire floor.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.671
Look, I grew up
in the Brewsters.

36:45.671 --> 36:49.274
And now I got homes
in Detroit, Cali, and Florida.

36:49.274 --> 36:52.411
I run the one just like Zeke,
and I'm relentless.

36:52.411 --> 36:54.346
<i>See, I love that
'cause I got the same type</i>

36:54.346 --> 36:55.781
of will and audacity,
and my crew,

36:55.781 --> 36:58.850
they loyal as fuck
and ready to suit up whenever.

36:58.850 --> 37:01.553
Just this point, I'm running
go around without my brother.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.688
He don't have the vision?

37:02.688 --> 37:03.989
That nigga got
a different vision, man.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.891
He want to finish school
and all that bullshit.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.694
My brother was the same way.

37:08.694 --> 37:10.429
Nigga thought he was
going to the league

37:10.429 --> 37:12.764
until I got him to shift
focus on the real.

37:14.433 --> 37:18.837
You and Tee remind me of us.
But winners are never late.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.542
So you knew there'd be
drug dogs at the airport

37:23.542 --> 37:25.377
and that I'd be late.

37:25.377 --> 37:28.780
But I delivered, K-9, and I'm
gonna keep on delivering.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.883
And if you give me a shot,
man, I promise we gonna grow.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.819
When we done, you gonna
have enough to buy a house

37:33.819 --> 37:35.554
in every fuckin' state
in the nation.

37:36.521 --> 37:38.290
Don't cash a check
your ass can't cover.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.626
Shit, your brother already
told us how we get down.

37:40.626 --> 37:42.327
And you seen firsthand.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.931
So am I good
for ten bricks or what?

37:51.837 --> 37:55.040
If you can do 10,
then you can do 20.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.575
You got a problem with that,
hot potato?

37:56.575 --> 37:58.043
Hell no.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.678
Let's get it.
I'm ready to do it right now.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.780
Good.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.049
Fellas, gather around.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.717
Got some gifts for you guys.

38:07.419 --> 38:10.322
'Cause, Meech,
the only way to be the man

38:10.322 --> 38:14.359
is to take care of the people
who take care of you.

38:14.359 --> 38:15.694
Right, fellas?

38:15.694 --> 38:17.996
I got one especially for you, Meech.

38:22.034 --> 38:23.802
Man, I don't even know
what to say, man.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.737
Your word is your bond
out in these streets.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.972
That's all we got.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.875
So don't ever let nobody
disrespect that.

38:29.875 --> 38:33.011
And if they do violate it,

38:33.011 --> 38:36.381
you gotta make it your fuckin'
business to demonstrate.

38:36.381 --> 38:39.651
Big L had a big fuckin' mouth,

38:39.651 --> 38:41.887
so I took care of that for you.

38:41.887 --> 38:43.422
Good lookin'.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.824
Just know,

38:45.824 --> 38:48.593
if you don't give me my money
on time,

38:48.593 --> 38:50.495
I'm gonna kill you.

38:51.763 --> 38:52.864
Then I'ma kill your brother

39:39.544 --> 39:40.946
Enough.

39:40.946 --> 39:44.416
I'm guessing you picked up
four, maybe five rides

39:44.416 --> 39:46.384
for about $10 a pop?

39:46.384 --> 39:49.154
With a tip, that's probably
a grand total of 50 bones.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.124
I'm making
a honest fuckin' living.

39:52.124 --> 39:53.525
Well, that's an honest living.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.594
But is that your dream
or is that Pops's dream?

39:55.594 --> 39:56.728
- You know what?
- No, just listen.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.829
Hear me out, hear me out,
hear me out.

39:57.829 --> 39:58.897
All right?

39:58.897 --> 40:01.433
I finally got a steady supply

40:01.433 --> 40:03.468
so we can start expanding
just like we talked about.

40:03.468 --> 40:04.903
Nigga, we gonna set up shop
in other cities

40:04.903 --> 40:06.471
and take over
the fuckin' nation.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.840
I already told you. I'm out.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.542

gonna quit wasting your time

40:13.812 --> 40:15.046

40:15.046 --> 40:16.782
I'm not talking about
no small-time bullshit

40:16.782 --> 40:17.916
like when we did with Pat.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.186
K-9 is getting the supply
from Colombians.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.421

fuck nothin' up

40:31.096 --> 40:32.097
when we work together.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.965
We always come on top.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.434
- It's the same thing here.
- Nah.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.904
This is your stop
right here, though.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.138
<i>Oh, this my stop?</i>

40:40.138 --> 40:41.973
<i>Yep.

"Didn't your mama teach you
that it's not polite to stare?"

41:03.094 --> 41:04.629
Next thing I know,

41:04.629 --> 41:06.798
an old Eartha Kitt sounding
voice yells out,

41:06.798 --> 41:09.968
"I told him,
but that boy don't listen!"

41:12.470 --> 41:15.040

- Good, thank you.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.822
Hey, grab that extra chair.
Meechie's coming for dinner.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.960
What is that on your face?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.661
Oh, it's just lip gloss.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.496
Well, you're too young
to wear that.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.532
Should be more worried
about Meech than me.

41:40.532 --> 41:41.900
Excuse me?

41:41.900 --> 41:44.269
I am so sick and tired
of you talking back.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.239
Every time I say something,
you got something to say.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.841
Now wipe that mess
off your face like I said.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.676
Nicole, do like your mom says.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.216
Please tell me we're not here
to see that snaggletooth perp

41:58.216 --> 42:00.051
- I hit.
- Nah, but I did cover you

42:00.051 --> 42:02.020
on the accusation
he made with Beckwith.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.822
Did you pull
that Asian driver card?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.257
Well, I just said
he ran into your car,

42:05.257 --> 42:06.725
and you ain't had time to stop.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.628
Well, I guess I should say
thank you, partner.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.196
Look...

42:11.196 --> 42:12.864
losing Lopez changed me.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.734
I wasn't as transparent about
things as I could have been.

42:15.734 --> 42:18.003
I vowed not to make
that mistake again.

42:18.003 --> 42:19.971
I'm still not following.

42:24.242 --> 42:27.545
- Dr. Gaines.
- Detective Bryant.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.016
I'm afraid
there's been no changes.

42:31.016 --> 42:32.651
Patient's still in a coma,
and the vitals

42:32.651 --> 42:34.019
are still touch and go.

42:34.019 --> 42:35.153
Pupils are miotic.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.222
G-C scale's non-responsive.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.891
Making matters worse,
we're attaching a colostomy bag

42:39.891 --> 42:41.059
for the foreseeable future.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.228
Dr. Gaines,
I need this man alive.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.130
<i>We're doing
the best we can,</i>

42:45.130 --> 42:46.798
<i>but I'm not sure
it'll be enough.</i>

42:48.066 --> 42:50.035
<i>Lamar fucking Silas?</i>

42:52.137 --> 42:55.106
The crime board says
that Silas is deceased.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.308
We're keeping him
under a false name

42:56.308 --> 42:57.842
as a protective measure.

42:57.842 --> 43:00.946
If he wakes up, we hope
he'll tell us who shot him.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.352
<i>Aw, baby.</i>

43:07.585 --> 43:08.920
Got me a flower.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.289
Aw. Okay.
Come on, y'all.

43:11.289 --> 43:13.258
Let's sit down here
for this dinner.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.827
All right now, tell me, how
was the first day on the job?

43:15.827 --> 43:16.861
Slow.

43:16.861 --> 43:17.929
We need to strategize

43:17.929 --> 43:19.331
on increasing
our profit margin.

43:19.331 --> 43:21.232
All right now, we can talk
about business later.

43:21.232 --> 43:24.235
Come on, let's bless this food
so we can eat.

43:24.235 --> 43:26.204
<i>Nicole, you want to say grace?</i>

43:26.204 --> 43:28.173
I didn't know
I was allowed to talk.

43:29.741 --> 43:31.876
- <i>I'll pray.</i>
- Okay.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.078
Don't forget
to include your brother

43:33.078 --> 43:34.112
in the blessing, please.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.380
I thought Meech was coming.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.248
Well, something
must have come up.

43:37.248 --> 43:38.383
Mm.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.787
Thank You, Lord,
for this beautiful gift

43:42.787 --> 43:47.258
that Mama prepared and for this
family and my brother Meech.

43:47.258 --> 43:48.960
<i>Please protect him, O Lord,</i>

43:48.960 --> 43:52.163
and watch over every single
person at this table.

43:52.163 --> 43:54.833
We ask all these things
in Your name,

43:54.833 --> 43:57.635
our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ.

43:57.635 --> 43:58.903
Amen.

43:58.903 --> 44:00.338
- Amen.
- Hey.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.340
Brother, you getting better
and better at these blessings.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.376
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought he was about

44:04.376 --> 44:06.978
to do a Pastor Swift
Thanksgiving prayer.

44:10.782 --> 44:12.384
Listen up.

44:12.384 --> 44:15.153
The 50 Boyz, dead.

44:15.153 --> 44:17.922
12th Street, dead.

44:17.922 --> 44:20.925
From now on, we BMF.

44:20.925 --> 44:24.662
Black Mafia Family.

44:24.662 --> 44:26.898
I just need to ask
all y'all a question.

44:26.898 --> 44:30.101
Is you in or is you out?

44:30.101 --> 44:31.936
Now look, for some of y'all,

44:31.936 --> 44:34.005
this will be
the biggest decision

44:34.005 --> 44:35.340
of your fuckin' lives.

44:35.340 --> 44:39.044
<i>We are about to turn BMF
into a global empire,</i>

44:39.044 --> 44:40.945
<i>absorbing all the crews.</i>

44:40.945 --> 44:43.314
<i>Everybody in here gonna be
shining like new money.</i>

44:43.314 --> 44:45.083
<i>Everybody in here
gonna move as one.</i>

44:45.083 --> 44:47.786
<i>Everybody in here
gonna have their own house,</i>

44:47.786 --> 44:51.222
<i>own clothes, own cars,
own hos.</i>

44:51.222 --> 44:52.991
I just need y'all with me.

44:52.991 --> 44:55.794
So if you can't work
with the nigga across from you

44:55.794 --> 44:59.931
or if you can't handle
what I'm saying, just bounce.

44:59.931 --> 45:04.702
If you can't even be a standup
guy, get the fuck on.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.739
<i>We just got 20 keys
from the new plug.</i>

45:07.739 --> 45:09.974
<i>Now if y'all in the mood
to have too much money</i>

45:09.974 --> 45:12.377
<i>to count, stand up.</i>

45:13.378 --> 45:15.947
If y'all trying to set up shop
in Cleveland...

45:15.947 --> 45:16.948
- Yeah.
- <i>St. Louis...</i>

45:16.948 --> 45:17.982
- Yeah.
- <i>Atlanta...</i>

45:17.982 --> 45:19.017
- Yeah.
- <i>Miami...</i>

45:19.017 --> 45:20.051
- Yeah.
- <i>LA...</i>

45:20.051 --> 45:21.419
Yeah!

45:21.419 --> 45:24.989
Raise your glass
in the air right now.

45:24.989 --> 45:26.958
We about to take over
the whole nation.

45:26.958 --> 45:29.794
Pledge allegiance
to the Black Mafia Family!

45:29.794 --> 45:31.396
To the Black Mafia Family!

45:35.333 --> 45:37.001
I am so grateful that things

45:37.001 --> 45:39.404
are working out
with you and Terry.

45:39.404 --> 45:42.740
Well, leaving with Terry Jr.
seemed to have done the trick.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.209
Just like you said it would.

45:44.209 --> 45:47.946
Look, a woman's instincts
are never wrong.

45:47.946 --> 45:49.214
What the hell
are y'all talking about?

45:52.317 --> 45:55.086
I know you not eavesdropping
on our conversation.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.287
Ma, you planned
this whole thing with Wanda

45:56.287 --> 45:57.455
to get me out of the game?

45:58.890 --> 46:00.992
Look, we were just doing
what was best for you.

46:00.992 --> 46:02.160
That's bullshit!

46:02.160 --> 46:03.261
<i>You trying
to manipulate my life</i>

46:03.261 --> 46:04.329
just like everybody else.

46:04.329 --> 46:05.497
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

46:05.497 --> 46:07.065
We already lost control
of Meech.

46:07.065 --> 46:08.967
We ain't losing you
to these damn streets as well.

46:08.967 --> 46:09.968
You knew about this too?

46:12.237 --> 46:14.405
- Oh, my fuckin' God.
- Oh, no.

46:14.405 --> 46:16.941
You not gonna use the Lord's
name in vain in my house.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.076
I don't know
who the hell to trust

46:18.076 --> 46:19.310
in this family anymore.

46:19.310 --> 46:20.979
Damn!

46:20.979 --> 46:22.547
- Bang on something else.
- Babe.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.358
We've been brothers
for years, B.

46:33.358 --> 46:35.860
I know killing Kato
fucked you up.

46:35.860 --> 46:37.996
But you proved
your loyalty to me.

46:37.996 --> 46:39.998
That's why I decided
to make you my right hand.

46:39.998 --> 46:42.901
<i>That means I'ma lean on you
more than I ever did before.</i>

46:44.035 --> 46:45.203
Don't trip.

46:45.203 --> 46:47.005
I got you.

46:47.005 --> 46:49.073
Shit, I would have thought
that made you more happy.

46:49.073 --> 46:51.109
Yeah. Yeah, I...

46:52.043 --> 46:53.478
You know,
I just gotta check on my moms.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.580
- How's she doing?
- She's alive,

46:55.813 --> 46:57.215
which is good enough for me.

46:58.249 --> 46:59.884
You come back
from a lot of shit

46:59.884 --> 47:01.586
as long as you don't
get no toe-tag.

47:03.388 --> 47:06.591
Once they put that bitch
on you, it's a wrap.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.862
Well, let me know
if she needs anything.

47:10.862 --> 47:12.197
That's my moms too.

47:16.267 --> 47:17.902
I love you, dog.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.008
100%.

47:27.979 --> 47:29.414
<i>Wolves like to run in packs</i>

47:29.414 --> 47:31.549
<i>'cause they're harder
to catch that way.</i>

47:31.549 --> 47:34.919
<i>They call it
the Law of the Jungle.</i>

47:34.919 --> 47:38.556
<i>But now Meech
was running alone.</i>

47:38.556 --> 47:41.893
<i>I'd accomplished most
of what I was after as well,</i>

47:41.893 --> 47:43.461
<i>but I, too, was alone.</i>

47:49.067 --> 47:51.169
<i>And so was B-Mickie.</i>

47:58.109 --> 48:00.078
Don't be stupid, nigga.

48:00.078 --> 48:02.013
Now slowly take out your piece,

48:02.013 --> 48:04.282
put it on the table there.

48:04.282 --> 48:05.883
Come on now.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.589
How the hell
you get in my house?

48:11.589 --> 48:12.957
I'm po-po.

48:12.957 --> 48:14.926
I can get in anywhere
at any time,

48:14.926 --> 48:16.961
especially when a motherfucker
ducking me.

48:16.961 --> 48:19.130
My moms
ain't been feeling well.

48:19.130 --> 48:21.099
I've been the one busy
taking care of her.

48:21.099 --> 48:23.501
And here I was thinking
that you was laid up

48:23.501 --> 48:25.903
with some broad
until I found this.

48:25.903 --> 48:27.372
Wow.

48:27.372 --> 48:30.375
And I realized
that your ass is sprung.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.210
<i>But I guess, uh,</i>

48:32.210 --> 48:34.545
<i>the-the pussy
must not have been that good.</i>

48:34.545 --> 48:37.115
First, you break into my shit.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.316
Now you going through everything

48:38.316 --> 48:39.984
after I already gave you
Kato's ass

48:39.984 --> 48:40.985
for your partner's murder?

48:40.985 --> 48:42.620
I want Meech.

48:42.620 --> 48:45.423
Not some dead bitch
that you put to rest.

48:45.423 --> 48:48.126
All I can tell you
is Terry's out.

48:48.126 --> 48:50.161
And Meech is the one
that's running shit on his own.

48:50.161 --> 48:52.463
You trying to game a gamer?

48:56.934 --> 48:58.469
Nah.

48:58.469 --> 49:00.438
I ain't got no reason
to lie to you.

49:08.379 --> 49:10.181
Look here.

49:10.181 --> 49:11.949
You better come with
something bigger next time,

49:11.949 --> 49:14.018
'cause I still got
your other gun,

49:14.018 --> 49:17.455
which means I can hang yo' ass
anytime on a double homicide

49:17.455 --> 49:19.624
of Jay-Mo
and your beloved Kato.

49:23.094 --> 49:24.962
Anytime.
