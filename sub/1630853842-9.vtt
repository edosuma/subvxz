00:29.904 --> 00:32.574
So, I've been having these dreams.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.289
And last night, I dreamed I found Jed.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.251
And he told me

00:44.085 --> 00:47.797
who his foster parents are
and where they live.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.844
So, when I woke up this morning,
I went there.

00:53.511 --> 00:55.889
But when I got there…

00:58.725 --> 00:59.726
Jed was gone.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.898
And they were dead.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.110
I know it's hard to believe, but--

01:09.194 --> 01:10.528
I believe you.

01:11.362 --> 01:15.575
Because last night, I had a dream
that I spent the night with Hector.

01:16.284 --> 01:19.454
And when I woke up this morning…

01:23.208 --> 01:24.417
Oh, my God.

01:25.376 --> 01:26.211
I know.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.547
Is it real?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.258
Feel it.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.058
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.189
What is happening to us?

01:49.109 --> 01:51.778
I think I know the answer to that.

01:54.614 --> 01:55.865
I think it's me.

02:04.499 --> 02:07.335
I don't know how she did it,
but Rose just got Lyta pregnant.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.295
What?

02:09.379 --> 02:12.298
Apparently it happened in her dream,
and when Lyta woke up--

02:12.382 --> 02:15.385
-She was still pregnant.
-Very much so.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.594
Then it's starting.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.889
Rose is weakening
the walls between the realms.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.058
You gonna tell the boss?

02:23.893 --> 02:25.645
-No.
-"No"?

02:25.728 --> 02:27.147
It's none of my business.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.523
Uh, since when?

02:28.606 --> 02:33.236
Since Lord Morpheus reminded me
that I'm merely a librarian

02:33.319 --> 02:35.572
and should concern myself
with my books from now on.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.782
He said that?

02:37.866 --> 02:38.867
He did. So…

02:38.950 --> 02:40.535
What is wrong with him?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.453
Nothing is wrong with him.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.374
He's always been this way.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.377
He's just been away so long I'd forgotten.

02:51.379 --> 02:55.842
He's determined to deal with the vortex
and the missing Arcana by himself.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.010
Without anyone's help.

03:00.430 --> 03:05.727
So any news must be reported
directly and exclusively to him.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.564
Okay. But can I keep you in the loop?

03:10.690 --> 03:12.317
You'd better not.

03:12.400 --> 03:18.031
In His Majesty's current mood,
he could banish us both to the Darkness.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.282
As he did Gault.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.660
All right, fine.
I'll go back to spying on Rose.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.245
But you should make up with him.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.081
I should make up with him?

03:27.165 --> 03:30.877
Yes.
Now's not the time to be fighting,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.588
not when there's a vortex
getting people pregnant

03:33.671 --> 03:36.216
and runaway Nightmares
doing God knows what.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.472
Mm.

03:46.768 --> 03:47.810
You want another one?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.314
Don't we have to meet Rose?

03:51.397 --> 03:54.108
-No, Rose is coming to meet us.
-Here?

03:54.192 --> 03:56.569
No. I have to go to a work thing.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.612
It's a convention.

03:57.695 --> 04:00.698
-We'll call her from there.
-Like a comic book convention?

04:01.574 --> 04:02.909
You like comic books?

04:03.868 --> 04:04.702
I used to.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.454
Back when you were a kid?

04:06.537 --> 04:07.664
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.252
-Can I ask you a question?
-Shoot.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.379
What's your name?

04:16.089 --> 04:20.343
Have you ever noticed
how people only ever use your name

04:20.426 --> 04:22.428
when you're in trouble… Jed?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.682
"We need to talk, Jed."

04:26.391 --> 04:28.017
"Get in here, Jed."

04:30.770 --> 04:32.397
You sound like my Uncle Barnaby.

04:33.106 --> 04:37.026
-Exactly.
-He's gonna come looking for me.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.445
No, he's not.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.699
He always comes looking for me.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.159
Hmm, not this time.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.831
Do you run away a lot?

04:51.291 --> 04:53.209
-Hmm.
-I do too.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.295
And I'll tell you a secret.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.675
I'm running away right now.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.886
You are?

05:03.970 --> 05:06.389
And once we get to Rose,
we don't have to run anymore.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.142
We'll be home free.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.687
Are you ready to meet your sister?

05:12.770 --> 05:13.604
Yeah.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.692
Well, then let's go. Come on.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.362
You wanna drive?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.824
Ah!

05:26.534 --> 05:28.328
This is all my fault.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.122
Because you're a dream vortex?

05:31.205 --> 05:35.335
I don't know how I'm doing it
or even when I'm doing it,

05:37.045 --> 05:40.715
but I promise you… I will fix this.

05:41.716 --> 05:43.509
I will make it go away.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.595
No, you won't.

05:46.804 --> 05:50.308
Look, whatever's happening,
however it's happening,

05:50.391 --> 05:52.602
our dreams are coming true.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.812
You found Jed in your dreams.

05:55.396 --> 05:57.106
And I found Hector.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.068
In fact, uh…

06:02.278 --> 06:03.863
he's asked me to live with him there.

06:04.655 --> 06:05.490
Where?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.409
In your dreams?

06:10.787 --> 06:12.580
How? That's impossible.

06:12.663 --> 06:17.418
I have no idea.
I mean, if this can happen, I have to try.

06:18.586 --> 06:23.257
So, you'd just… give up on your life here?

06:23.883 --> 06:26.135
-What life?
-Don't say that.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.345
It's true, though.

06:28.721 --> 06:32.517
And… you can always visit.

06:34.977 --> 06:35.895
How?

06:35.978 --> 06:39.399
The same way
you found Jed and I found Hector.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.235
In your dreams.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.370
-Hello?
-Hi.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.789
I'm calling because
I found one of your flyers.

06:54.872 --> 06:56.374
-About a missing boy?
-Yes?

06:58.000 --> 06:59.544
I think I found him.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.549
-Rose?
-Jed?

07:04.632 --> 07:06.759
-Hi!
-Hi.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.595
I… I can't believe it.
Are you okay? Where are you?

07:10.179 --> 07:12.598
We're at a hotel in Georgia.
Can you come get me?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.559
Yes. I'm leaving right now, Jeddy.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.811
Tell me the name of the hotel.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.735
The Royal Empire Hotel.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.529
Royal Empire Hotel.

07:32.493 --> 07:35.621
You're about three hours from here.
Is that okay?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.248
She's three hours away.

07:37.331 --> 07:38.416
I'll answer to her.

07:39.167 --> 07:43.254
Rose. Take your time. Just call us
at this number when you get here.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.008
Thank you. Oh. I almost forgot.
What's your name?

07:47.091 --> 07:48.509
We'll see you soon.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.055
All right, kid. Let's go.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.472
Been on the road for three days.
Drive was a killer.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.975
Hate these hick towns. Wouldn't be caught
dead here if it wasn't for the convention.

08:43.272 --> 08:46.567
-What you looking for?
-It's a cereal convention.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.070
I thought there'd be cereal.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.030
Are you still hungry?

08:52.073 --> 08:56.410
Okay. Well, have a seat, uh, over there
and we'll get you something to eat.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.705
Tell ya, I could murder a steak.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.665
A good, bloody steak.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.625
They do this
chocolate fudge whip to die for.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.671
The TV version butchered it,
but you can find it uncut online.

09:06.754 --> 09:09.757
Hell, I thought this whole issue
was dead and buried in the '60s.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.843
That's when Harry
killed the lights. I could've died.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.428
He slays me, that guy.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.935
Nemesis of Neglect, there you go.

09:31.612 --> 09:32.905
There he is.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.492
Our guest of honor
doesn't need to wait in line.

09:36.576 --> 09:43.124
We've got name tags and room keys for you
and the young woman joining you.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.127
I've got her younger brother
with me as well.

09:53.342 --> 09:57.722
You may want to advise him
to steer clear of the convention areas.

09:59.974 --> 10:01.017
Yeah.

10:02.810 --> 10:05.146
Uh, Miss Walker? It's Gilbert.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.190
Uh, one second.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.109
Go. I'll be fine.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.955
Our esteemed landlord tells me
we're running low on these.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.832
Actually, we don't need them anymore.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.376
I just got a call. Someone found Jed.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.419
What? Where?

10:28.502 --> 10:31.088
He's at a hotel in Georgia.
I'm on my way there now.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.049
You're not going alone, I hope.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.385
Uh, Lyta's not feeling well, so…

10:37.011 --> 10:38.846
You must allow me to accompany you.

10:38.929 --> 10:43.142
Uh, I believe America is a very large
and excitable place,

10:43.225 --> 10:46.604
and a young person traveling alone
can get into all kind of scrapes.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.189
As witnessed the other night.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.816
That's very generous of you, but--

10:50.900 --> 10:52.610
If you'll indulge me,

10:52.693 --> 10:56.280
I should rather enjoy the role
of amateur knight errant.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.992
I have my swordstick
and an ancient but serviceable revolver.

11:00.076 --> 11:03.788
All right. But where we're going,
we won't need to defend ourselves.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.416
I, uh, actually got to meet him once.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.709
You met the Big Bad Wolf?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.045
The actor who did the voice.

11:11.128 --> 11:12.004
Wow.

11:12.588 --> 11:14.674
Hey. Fun.

11:15.716 --> 11:19.804
Fun Land. Not "Fun." Fun Land.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.975
Got it. Sorry about that.

11:25.601 --> 11:28.688
-That's okay.
-I see you've met my young friend.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.022
-Oh.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.315
Is he with you?

11:31.399 --> 11:32.608
He is.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.903
He and his sister are my guests
and under my protection.

11:38.864 --> 11:39.782
Are we good?

11:42.910 --> 11:44.662
We are. Yeah. We're good.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.957
Glad to hear it. Come on, Jed.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.292
Nice to meet you.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.343
-You sure you don't mind driving?
-No. Not at all.

11:59.427 --> 12:04.140
When I left home, I made it my mission
to see as much of this world as possible.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.560
And home is England? You sound English.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.104
Thank you.

12:11.605 --> 12:14.442
Just, you know, to me,
the object of travel

12:14.525 --> 12:16.861
is not to set foot in a foreign land,

12:16.944 --> 12:21.991
but at last to set foot
in your own country as a foreign land.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.285
So, it's all about going home?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.913
Yes. I, I suppose it must be, in the end.

12:28.789 --> 12:33.085
And, and you and Miss Hall will be
going home, I assume. Uh, with Jed?

12:33.669 --> 12:36.672
Uh, Lyta has other plans, actually.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.216
Oh, yes, you said that, um,
she wasn't feeling very well.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.509
Is everything all right?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.178
I hope so.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.786
Are you sure this is okay?

13:08.704 --> 13:09.663
Very sure.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.930
What was that?

13:29.308 --> 13:30.726
Uh…

13:30.810 --> 13:32.019
An earthquake.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.066
I'll be right back.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.614
This has never happened before, I promise.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.282
I believe you.

13:51.121 --> 13:52.957
It's fine.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.210
I guess if earthquakes
happen in real life,

13:56.877 --> 13:58.963
they can happen in dreams too, right?

13:59.046 --> 14:01.423
Yeah. We call those nightmares.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.008
Come here.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.305
Does this look like a nightmare to you?

14:09.849 --> 14:10.850
Not at all.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.341
Loosh? You in here?

14:44.425 --> 14:48.012
Whoops. Oh, sorry, boss.
I was looking for Lucienne.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.471
-See ya.
-Wait.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.019
Why were you looking for Lucienne?

14:55.102 --> 14:59.690
Oh, well, we just had some
minor seismic activity

14:59.773 --> 15:02.484
and a little, you know,
damage I wanted to report.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.361
Then why not report it to me?

15:04.945 --> 15:07.448
Uh, because you're busy?

15:07.531 --> 15:10.868
While you were away, Lucienne started
taking care of that stuff,

15:10.951 --> 15:13.078
so I figured…
why bother you when--

15:13.162 --> 15:17.041
Mervyn, if The Dreaming
has been damaged in any way,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.752
I will be the one to address it.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.134
Oh, for crying out loud.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.933
You want me to fix that for you?

15:34.016 --> 15:36.560
Or will it just keep happening?

15:36.644 --> 15:39.188
It will not keep happening

15:40.189 --> 15:42.775
because I will find
the cause of the disturbance

15:42.858 --> 15:44.485
and I will eliminate it.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.905
-Thank you, Mervyn.
-Uh, you're welcome.

16:05.756 --> 16:06.632
Lucienne?

16:09.635 --> 16:10.844
My lord.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.554
I have come to return these…

16:14.890 --> 16:18.227
and to assess the extent of the damage
from the recent disturbances.

16:24.191 --> 16:29.738
Have… you any idea as to what caused them?

16:32.032 --> 16:34.243
-I assumed it was you, sir.
-Me?

16:34.743 --> 16:40.082
Making further improvements
to the realm… now that you're back.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.211
Lucienne, when we last spoke,

16:44.294 --> 16:48.424
I did not mean to imply that your efforts
beyond the library are without value.

16:48.507 --> 16:49.341
Oh?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.593
I really wish to
relieve you of responsibilities

16:51.677 --> 16:54.847
with which, had I been here,
you would never have been burdened.

16:55.556 --> 16:56.598
I see.

16:56.682 --> 17:00.019
And… in that time,

17:00.102 --> 17:06.567
did you experience any…
similar seismic disturbances?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.444
I did not.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.827
Have you any… theory as to their origin?

17:18.829 --> 17:22.374
Speaking strictly as a librarian? I do.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.543
-But you won't like it.
-Go on.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.755
I know you're waiting to see

17:27.838 --> 17:31.175
if the vortex will lead you
to The Corinthian and Fiddler's Green.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.719
-The way she led you to Gault.
-She may yet still.

17:33.802 --> 17:37.306
Yes, but while you're waiting,
she's putting cracks in the foundation.

17:38.015 --> 17:40.726
Rose Walker has visited
this realm before and done no damage.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.811
-This is something else, something new.
-Perhaps.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.858
But if there is something new
in The Dreaming and you did not create it,

17:48.734 --> 17:50.235
how did it get here?

17:51.278 --> 17:54.114
This is the vortex. I assure you.

17:57.951 --> 18:00.037
I can't thank you enough, Unity.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.247
You did all the work, Rose, love.

18:02.873 --> 18:06.043
May I ask Mr. Holdaway to send tickets?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.086
Bring you both over?

18:07.795 --> 18:09.379
I'd love that. Thank you.

18:10.297 --> 18:13.884
I'll ask him to see about
making you Jed's legal guardian.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.428
So no one can take Jed away again.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.805
Would that be all right?

18:17.888 --> 18:19.431
Yes! Thank you, Unity.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.725
Thank Mr. Holdaway for me too.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.519
Thank you, Rose, love.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.274
I'll contact my associates in the US.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.902
What if they were to live here?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.279
-Here?
-In London.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.490
You could find us a house.

18:37.074 --> 18:40.202
Rose could write, Jed would go to school.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.080
I could adopt them.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.165
-At your age?

18:46.458 --> 18:49.169
Be happy for me, Mr. Holdaway.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.173
I'm going to have a life after all.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.301
You're going to London?

18:56.385 --> 18:58.929
And I'm gonna be
Jed's legal guardian from now on.

18:59.012 --> 19:03.559
I must say,
that's very grown-up, Rose Walker.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.103
It is, isn't it?

19:07.855 --> 19:10.315
-What's wrong?
-Well, what if Jed and I…

19:11.483 --> 19:13.569
-What if he doesn't like me?

19:13.652 --> 19:15.445
Or worse, what if I don't like him?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.657
-What?
-I'm just so impressed.

19:19.366 --> 19:23.579
You allowed yourself to be happy
for nearly a minute there

19:23.662 --> 19:26.707
before inventing some
new problems for yourself.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.000
I'm just nervous.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.502
I haven't seen him since he was five.

19:31.461 --> 19:34.715
The only thing I remember about him
is he used to love chicken fingers.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.217
That's all he'd eat for every meal.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.345
He's probably completely different now.

19:43.223 --> 19:47.394
Your sister will be here in a few hours
and I need you to do me a favor

19:47.477 --> 19:49.855
and just stay in the room
until she gets here, okay?

19:49.938 --> 19:52.900
-I can't go with you?
-No. No, no. Trust me, you don't want to.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.694
It's just a bunch of
boring grown-ups down there.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.029
Then why are you going?

19:57.112 --> 19:59.948
I'm going to make it… less boring.

20:00.657 --> 20:04.870
So, I'll see you in a couple hours.
And do not open this door.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.830
I won't, unless it's you.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.000
Okay. We gotta keep you safe, Jed Walker.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.630
-Hello.
-Hello.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.382
Thank you all for being here.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.677
Yeah, uh…

21:01.760 --> 21:05.222
I heard a story recently, uh,
I thought might amuse you.

21:08.475 --> 21:12.604
It seems that
the telephone rang in a police station.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.733
Uh, the duty cop answers,
and a woman's voice says,

21:16.817 --> 21:18.694
"Help. I've been reaped."

21:19.611 --> 21:22.823
The cop says, "Don't you mean 'raped'?"

21:23.448 --> 21:26.493
"No," she says, "He used a scythe."

21:37.087 --> 21:39.506
So it's really good
to see so many of us here,

21:40.424 --> 21:43.844
so many familiar faces
and, uh, new faces too.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.555
For those of you
joining us for the first time,

21:46.638 --> 21:49.850
there are a few rules we must adhere to.

21:49.933 --> 21:54.938
Firstly, use the sobriquet you provided

21:55.022 --> 21:57.232
which has been printed on your name tag.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.027
No civilian names.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.406
Secondly, uh, we don't shit where we eat.

22:04.489 --> 22:08.744
So nobody does any collecting
until the convention's over

22:08.827 --> 22:10.954
and you're at least 200 miles away.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.331
Aw.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.965
Thirdly, on an unfortunate note,

22:22.049 --> 22:26.345
The Family Man, who was to have been
our guest speaker this year,

22:27.095 --> 22:28.680
has not been able to make it.

22:28.764 --> 22:31.183
No. Come on.

22:31.767 --> 22:37.314
But… every cloud has a silver lining,

22:37.397 --> 22:40.525
and it gives me great pleasure

22:40.609 --> 22:45.238
to be able to present
our new guest of honor.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.658
Gentlemen, ladies…

22:50.952 --> 22:52.371
The Corinthian.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.193
The Corinthian's keynote address

23:23.276 --> 23:25.445
will be in this room
immediately after dinner.

23:25.529 --> 23:29.533
Before that,
we have our cocktail reception.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.662
And our first three panels
to kick off the weekend.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.331
The "Make It Pay" panel will be in Hall A…

23:36.415 --> 23:39.084
What fascinates me
about humanity

23:39.793 --> 23:44.256
is that so many people
are looking for reasons to be unhappy.

23:44.881 --> 23:47.717
It's only when they're mired
in their self-made misery

23:47.801 --> 23:50.095
that they are truly content.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.141
I'm boring you.

23:54.224 --> 23:55.684
Not at all.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.853
Oh, good. Because I do love a paradox.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.438
Chesterton did too.

23:59.521 --> 24:03.275
Take charity for example.
Charity usually means one of two things,

24:03.358 --> 24:07.028
pardoning an unpardonable act
or loving an unlovable person.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.323
Or take love. Love's an even better one.

24:10.407 --> 24:12.868
To love means loving the unlovable.

24:13.743 --> 24:16.288
To forgive means
pardoning the unpardonable.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.084
Faith means believing the unbelievable.

24:23.003 --> 24:29.134
And hope means hoping
even when everything seems hopeless.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.765
Look at you.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.020
I know, I'm huge.

24:40.103 --> 24:41.563
You're gorgeous.

24:41.646 --> 24:45.692
I wish this baby would hurry up
and just get here. It's been months.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.944
It's been two hours.

24:49.196 --> 24:50.197
No way.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.075
I guess time moves differently here.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.120
Come on, let me show you the house.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.998
I wish you could've seen it
when we moved in.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.333
Why? What's different?

25:01.416 --> 25:03.251
We've had earthquake damage.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.670
I'm so glad you're here!

25:07.464 --> 25:09.758
So what do you think?

25:11.092 --> 25:14.387
Tell Lucienne she was right
about the source of the tremors.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.766
And that I'm taking care of it.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.234
Hector, look who's here.

25:31.279 --> 25:36.076
Lyta, you remember I told you about
Lord Morpheus, the King of Dreams?

25:36.868 --> 25:38.245
What do you want?

25:39.329 --> 25:40.497
He wants us to leave.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.456
Why?

25:41.540 --> 25:45.627
Because a ghost cannot
escape his fate by hiding in The Dreaming.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.131
Nor can a living human being
escape her grief here.

25:50.215 --> 25:53.927
Do you not see the damage
your presence has done to this realm?

25:55.220 --> 25:57.180
I cannot allow you to stay.

25:57.764 --> 25:59.182
Is there anything we can do?

25:59.808 --> 26:01.351
You belong with the dead.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.353
You must go
to the place appointed for you.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.484
I'm sorry, but you must
say your goodbyes now.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.240
No.
I'm not losing you again.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.751
I love you so much.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.878
You're not going anywhere.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.089
Get out of our house.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.007
Lyta--

26:32.090 --> 26:32.966
Enough.

26:33.550 --> 26:36.761
Tell… Tell the baby I--

26:36.845 --> 26:37.846
No.

26:38.513 --> 26:40.307
-Please! Stop.
-Hector?

26:40.390 --> 26:42.642
-Dream, please, stop!
-No!

26:42.726 --> 26:43.852
Hector!

26:46.730 --> 26:47.564
No…

26:59.367 --> 27:02.579
Your husband died a long time ago.
He was a ghost and this is a dream.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.376
The baby is yours… for now.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.672
What do you mean?

27:12.756 --> 27:14.883
The child was conceived in The Dreaming.

27:15.967 --> 27:16.801
It is mine.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.011
What?

27:19.721 --> 27:22.474
And one day, I will come for it.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.934
No, you won't. You'll do nothing--

27:25.018 --> 27:26.061
This dream is over.

27:29.856 --> 27:33.401
-You killed my friend.
-How did you get here?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.404
In front of his wife,
and then you threaten to take her baby?

27:36.488 --> 27:38.365
Do you know why this happened?

27:39.199 --> 27:43.119
A vortex gathering strength
can weaken the walls between dreams.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.496
I didn't ask for any of this.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.122
-Even so!
-No!

27:46.206 --> 27:49.501
I don't want you coming near me
or my friends ever again.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.252
Rose, listen to me.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.462
I do listen to you.

27:52.545 --> 27:57.217
You said that a vortex
can create universes or destroy them.

27:57.967 --> 28:01.012
So I suggest
you leave my universe the fuck alone.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.640
-Rose--
-This dream is over.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.566
-Hey, are you okay?

28:13.650 --> 28:14.776
He took Hector.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.528
I know. Are you okay?

28:16.611 --> 28:18.613
Physically, I mean, is everything--

28:18.697 --> 28:20.115
I'm still pregnant.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.199
That's good, right?

28:21.825 --> 28:23.451
He said he would take the baby.

28:23.535 --> 28:24.494
He won't.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.706
He's not gonna bother you
or me ever again.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.374
I promise.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.084
We're here.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.547
Gilbert and I
just got to the hotel.

28:35.630 --> 28:38.758
We're gonna grab Jed
and come right back. Okay?

28:39.676 --> 28:41.177
-Okay.
-See you in a few hours.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.103
Is she all right?

28:51.062 --> 28:53.231
Well, let's find your brother then.

28:57.318 --> 29:01.406
I'm sorry, but you are too young
and too hot to be The Corinthian.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.533
You're too kind.

29:03.616 --> 29:07.287
I've always been curious.
Is the name biblical? A reference to Paul?

29:07.370 --> 29:09.914
Or to Corinth? The Roman city of vice?

29:09.998 --> 29:12.167
Or are you just into leather?

29:15.462 --> 29:17.547
You know, all of the above.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.258
Would, uh, you excuse me for a second?

29:27.432 --> 29:29.100
-Hi.
-Hi.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.059
Oh.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.021
Sorry for staring. It's just…

29:33.605 --> 29:35.565
I can't believe you're here.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.692
-I'm a huge fan.
-Hmm.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.988
There was this, um, incredibly detailed
article of your work online.

29:42.071 --> 29:44.991
I don't know if you've seen it.
It's on this blog called "Chaste."

29:45.074 --> 29:46.201
I'll have to look for it.

29:46.284 --> 29:48.244
Oh, I could send it to you if you want.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.456
I'm The Boogieman by the way.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.876
So I see.

29:54.959 --> 29:56.461
-Yeah.

29:56.544 --> 30:00.340
Say, can I… buy you a drink

30:00.423 --> 30:03.009
if I promise not to ask
too many annoying questions?

30:03.092 --> 30:04.803
I don't wanna monopolize you.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.596
Yeah. Let's get that drink later.

30:06.679 --> 30:08.139
-I'd love that.
-Yeah.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.478
Well, I see you've met The Boogieman.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.562
I have.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.692
And that's… not The Boogieman.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.071
Are you sure?

30:23.154 --> 30:27.116
The Boogieman's dead.
He drowned in Louisiana three years ago.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.577
But how do you know?

30:30.829 --> 30:31.663
I know.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.459
We will deal with this immediately.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.212
He mentioned a blog called "Chaste."

30:39.295 --> 30:40.964
Leave it with us.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.757
I'll look into it.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.802
I'll be right back.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.707
Hi, it's Rose Walker. Jed's sister.

31:15.790 --> 31:19.127
I'm here in the lobby
when you get this. So, thanks.

31:19.878 --> 31:23.548
So, do we, uh… wait here or, or…

31:23.631 --> 31:25.383
Well, it can't hurt to look around.

31:25.466 --> 31:26.342
Right.

31:29.304 --> 31:32.015
Uh, excuse me, sir, miss?

31:32.098 --> 31:34.809
I'm sorry, but this area
is for convention attendees only.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.605
Ooh, the Cereal Convention.
Yes, I saw your signage outside.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.899
I'm looking for my brother.
I'll run in and out.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.942
-I can't let you.
-I'll be a second.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.528
There are no kids in the convention area.

31:46.404 --> 31:47.655
I would know.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.617
No children at a cereal convention?

31:50.700 --> 31:53.202
That seems a bit of a missed opportunity

31:53.286 --> 31:56.456
or is it maybe sort of
more of a porridge and muesli affair?

31:56.539 --> 31:59.667
D-Do you mind?
I have to check these people in.

32:03.504 --> 32:06.591
I appear to have
annoyed him with my questions.

32:06.674 --> 32:10.011
Imagine how annoyed he'd be
if he found out we have these.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.264
Oh.

32:13.348 --> 32:16.392
I take it we're attending
the convention then.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.354
The only thing Jed loved
more than chicken fingers was cereal.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.607
I'll check the pool,
you check the convention hall,

32:22.690 --> 32:24.192
and we'll meet back here in 15?

32:24.275 --> 32:25.234
How exciting!

32:25.944 --> 32:28.279
I've never been an uncle before.

32:43.002 --> 32:46.714
Even 10Gs per victim
identified isn't too much to ask.

32:46.798 --> 32:50.051
Thing to remember is that
they'll pay to know for certain.

32:51.094 --> 32:53.513
Even if the cops don't go with it,
families will.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.765
The goal is to drag out hope.

32:55.848 --> 32:58.851
Because they will pay you
for proof that the trophy is alive.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.938
It's not a ton, but it's usually good
for a few grand at least.

33:02.021 --> 33:05.650
The extra cash is nice,
but we don't do it for the money.

33:05.733 --> 33:08.486
We do it because we are called to do it.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.613
Because we love doing it.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.615
We're artists.

33:27.005 --> 33:31.884
I have to tell you, I am sick and tired
of the bias against women in our field.

33:31.968 --> 33:36.723
That it is somehow easier for us
because we use our femininity.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.517
What they really mean is sexuality.

33:40.101 --> 33:42.895
As though a woman's sexuality
determines her value.

33:42.979 --> 33:47.608
I don't know about you, but I don't use
my sexuality when I'm collecting.

33:47.692 --> 33:52.864
I use the same skills as anyone else here:
intelligence, preparedness,

33:53.531 --> 33:56.492
and brute force, if necessary.

33:56.576 --> 33:59.746
I got 171.
Drowned most of them.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.498
It's not a numbers game for me.
It's about the person.

34:02.582 --> 34:05.960
I won't take just anybody.
I specialize. I'm a connoisseur.

34:10.673 --> 34:12.884
I am a merciful and just God.

34:13.968 --> 34:16.846
For I release men and women and children

34:16.929 --> 34:19.140
from the suffering
and torment of their lives.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.185
And I give them new life in my heaven.

34:22.268 --> 34:26.814
As a born-again Christian, I wanna
disassociate myself from this madman.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.359
I do the bidding of the Lord.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.486
With my hammer.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.237
With my love.

34:33.988 --> 34:38.201
It's not up to me to decide
who lives and who dies.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.495
That's up to God.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.081
God tells me to do it.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.958
God tells me to kill them.

34:46.042 --> 34:50.880
The "Chaste" blog is written
by an apparent fanboy named Philip Sitz.

34:51.672 --> 34:55.635
Who, as you can see,
looks exactly like our Boogieman.

34:55.718 --> 34:58.137
-Yeah.
-Since you're our guest,

34:58.221 --> 35:02.225
would you care to, uh… collect Mr. Sitz?

35:02.308 --> 35:04.644
Oh, I thought we don't shit where we eat.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.562
-Except when we have to.

35:07.188 --> 35:08.856
Needs must when the Devil drives.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.860
-But as fans of yours…
-Hmm.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.822
…we have to ask, could we watch you work?

35:15.905 --> 35:17.115
Oh, of course.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.828
Or we could work together
and share the experience.

35:31.087 --> 35:32.588
Please join us.

35:34.090 --> 35:34.924
So…

35:37.301 --> 35:40.638
Hi, it's Rose Walker calling again.
I'm at the pool now,

35:40.721 --> 35:44.142
but I guess maybe I'll see
if you and Jed are in the restaurant.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.269
Anyway, call me when you get this.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.521
Where do you hunt?

35:48.604 --> 35:49.981
I have a great place.

35:51.357 --> 35:53.359
There are thousands of people there.

35:53.442 --> 35:57.655
All these beautiful little kids
wandering off on their own, getting lost.

35:58.406 --> 36:01.742
Always happy to meet someone
who's friendly and kind.

36:01.826 --> 36:02.660
Yeah.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.328
There are quiet places to take them to

36:04.412 --> 36:06.747
where no one will bother you
until you're done.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.834
And if you can't find any kids
to play with you,

36:10.960 --> 36:12.545
you can always go on the rides.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.803
Yeah, that's,
uh, how I started collecting.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.431
How did you start?

36:25.057 --> 36:26.100
Porn.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.103
My dad had a subscription to Playboy.

36:29.687 --> 36:32.148
I used to lock myself
in the bathroom with them.

36:32.231 --> 36:37.528
Then hate myself afterwards
and… rip the magazine into shreds.

36:39.530 --> 36:42.867
Then when I finally had sex
with an actual woman,

36:43.409 --> 36:44.452
it was…

36:46.204 --> 36:47.455
awful.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.415
So I did what I always do.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.293
I ripped her to shreds.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.009
Uh, may I leave a message for someone?

37:00.760 --> 37:02.762
The name is Rose Walker.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.681
Ms. Walker hasn't checked in yet.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.516
When she does,
I can give her your message.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.435
No, no, no, but she's not a guest here.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.479
She has a room reserved.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.105
Does she?

37:17.777 --> 37:20.446
C-Can you leave a message
for her, please? From Gilbert.

37:21.030 --> 37:23.532
Hey, I was just looking for you.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.326
Do you, um…

37:25.952 --> 37:29.455
Do you have time
for that drink at the bar now?

37:29.538 --> 37:30.414
Uh…

37:31.290 --> 37:34.752
How about we find some place
that's a little bit quieter?

37:41.342 --> 37:43.261
Uh… Yeah. Okay.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.644
Hi, I'm looking for my younger brother.

37:51.727 --> 37:54.438
And I was wondering
if maybe you've seen him?

37:59.110 --> 38:00.444
Oh, you're Rose Walker.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.030
I am. Why?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.907
I have your room key right here.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.742
-My room key?
-Mm-hmm.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.035
And a message from Gilbert.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.454
He says he's very sorry
but he had to go home.

38:11.747 --> 38:13.457
Um, did he say why?

38:13.541 --> 38:16.669
No, I'm sorry. But can I have
someone show you to your room?

38:18.838 --> 38:21.632
No, I can find it. Thank you.

38:28.723 --> 38:29.598
Lucienne?

38:31.267 --> 38:33.602
My lord.
There's something I must tell you.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.271
And I will listen.

38:35.354 --> 38:37.815
But first, you must let me tell you that

38:38.816 --> 38:39.775
you were right.

38:40.901 --> 38:44.113
The vortex was responsible
for the damage to our realm,

38:44.196 --> 38:47.366
and I was… wrong

38:47.450 --> 38:50.786
to risk our safety in the hope
that she would locate the missing Arcana.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.581
You were not entirely wrong, sir.

38:54.248 --> 38:55.958
-She's found them both.
-What?

38:56.542 --> 38:59.795
The Corinthian and Fiddler's Green?
Where? How do you know?

39:00.504 --> 39:02.089
Fiddler's Green told me.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.436
Apologies, lord, for having left.

39:16.896 --> 39:19.815
Why? Why did you leave?

39:21.901 --> 39:24.653
I trusted you.
You were the heart of The Dreaming.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.030
No, sir.

39:26.113 --> 39:29.909
You were the heart of The Dreaming.
And you were gone.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.703
I was curious.

39:32.787 --> 39:35.915
And it turns out that
life as a human contains substance

39:35.998 --> 39:39.126
I never even imagined when I was here.

39:39.794 --> 39:44.006
Which is why I've returned
because… he's murdering them.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.007
The Corinthian?

39:45.091 --> 39:49.720
He appears to have built up a cult
of worshippers who kill for pleasure,

39:49.804 --> 39:51.972
endangering the waking world

39:52.056 --> 39:55.851
and the life
of a friend called Rose Walker.

39:55.935 --> 39:58.813
The Corinthian has found Rose Walker?

39:58.896 --> 39:59.980
Yes.

40:00.064 --> 40:03.401
Can you imagine the damage
he could do with someone like Rose?

40:03.484 --> 40:05.277
You must tell me where they are.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.344
Oh.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.804
Hey, guys, what's, uh…

40:33.097 --> 40:34.223
What's going on?

40:34.807 --> 40:40.354
We know who you are… Philip.

40:41.105 --> 40:45.067
What are you talking about?
I'm The Boogieman.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.986
R-Really. I am.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.279
You're not one of us.

40:49.738 --> 40:52.283
No. No. I am, I…

40:52.366 --> 40:55.995
I-I wanna be. I want to understand,
that's why I had to get here.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.329
To see you all.

40:59.123 --> 41:00.332
To learn.

41:01.125 --> 41:04.336
Okay, then… let us teach you.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.630
The Good Doctor.

41:07.381 --> 41:12.720
She likes to kill her victims
by removing their organs, one by one.

41:12.803 --> 41:14.555
Nimrod is a hunter.

41:14.638 --> 41:19.602
He can skin, bone, joint,
and gut just about any animal in minutes.

41:22.229 --> 41:26.317
And as for me, well…

41:27.359 --> 41:29.028
I like the eyes.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.510
This one's mine.

41:56.555 --> 41:57.389
Whoa.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.058
-Buddy.
-Sorry.

41:59.141 --> 42:00.309
Are you okay? What's wrong?

42:00.392 --> 42:01.352
They're after me.

42:01.435 --> 42:02.603
Who? Who's after you?

42:03.354 --> 42:04.271
Come on.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.774
You'll be safe in my room. Yeah?

42:11.237 --> 42:16.867
So, he too spent the last century
in the waking world.

42:16.951 --> 42:21.872
Yes, but he seems to have
experienced the worst of humankind.

42:21.956 --> 42:26.001
Still, his time there appears to have
changed him as it has changed me.

42:26.085 --> 42:28.045
-How so?

42:28.128 --> 42:32.091
Lucienne, he came to you
and told you he was wrong.

42:32.174 --> 42:33.842
It was very nearly an apology.

42:33.926 --> 42:36.679
The Morpheus I knew was incapable of that.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.055
Hmm.

42:38.138 --> 42:42.685
Then perhaps he will be merciful to you
since you came back on your own.

42:42.768 --> 42:44.812
Oh, it doesn't matter what happens to me.

42:44.895 --> 42:48.607
What matters is that
Dream stops The Corinthian

42:49.316 --> 42:51.277
and saves Rose Walker.

42:52.278 --> 42:54.530
There is no saving Rose Walker.

42:56.031 --> 42:57.950
Why on earth would you say that?

42:58.701 --> 42:59.702
Do you not know?

43:02.162 --> 43:03.747
She's a vortex.

43:05.082 --> 43:05.958
Oh.

43:06.834 --> 43:07.960
Oh, dear.

43:08.627 --> 43:10.087
I should have realized.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.172
What have I done?

43:12.256 --> 43:15.551
He's… He's going to have to kill her.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.481
Hello?

43:37.323 --> 43:38.490
Hello?

43:41.327 --> 43:42.161
Jed?

43:43.871 --> 43:44.955
Rose?

43:49.543 --> 43:51.545
-Jed?
-Rose!

43:58.093 --> 44:00.554
You can't have him. He's my friend.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.847
-Stop.
-We were playing.

44:01.930 --> 44:04.016
-Let him go. He's my brother.
-He's mine!

44:04.099 --> 44:05.768
Let me go!

44:16.695 --> 44:17.655
Hurry up!

44:22.785 --> 44:23.702
Come on!

44:25.704 --> 44:28.791
Help! Help!

44:30.417 --> 44:31.627
You hurt me.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.546
Now I'm gonna have to hurt you.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.886
Hello, Rose.

44:47.267 --> 44:48.102
Don't worry.

44:52.189 --> 44:53.399
You're safe with me.
