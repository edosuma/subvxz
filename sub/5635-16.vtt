00:20.569 --> 00:22.904
I'm Tammy Larson
with Wagstaff School News.

00:22.905 --> 00:24.070
Our top story:

00:24.156 --> 00:25.813
Boyz 4 Now has broken up.

00:25.874 --> 00:27.909
Son of a bitch!

00:27.910 --> 00:29.293
It's true.
I'm not kidding,

00:29.294 --> 00:31.045
I wish I was kidding,
I am not kidding.

00:31.046 --> 00:32.580
Anyway, here's Jocelyn.

00:32.581 --> 00:34.332
They're breaking up
because Boo Boo is

00:34.333 --> 00:36.667
going solo,
but who cares about Boo Boo

00:36.668 --> 00:38.134
because everyone
cool likes Griffin.

00:38.220 --> 00:39.554
Or Alan.

00:39.555 --> 00:41.088
Jocelyn, how are
the fans taking it?

00:41.089 --> 00:44.091
And I can't even think about it...

00:44.092 --> 00:45.476
Stop it, Jocelyn.
‭

00:45.477 --> 00:47.595
Don't you cry or I'm gonna cry.

00:51.433 --> 00:52.483
Louise!

00:52.484 --> 00:53.734
Geez, Tina!

00:53.735 --> 00:55.069
Boyz 4 Now!
Boo Boo!

00:55.070 --> 00:56.270
Did you hear?
‭I heard.

00:56.271 --> 00:57.605
Pull yourself together.

00:57.606 --> 00:59.106
We need each other right now.

00:59.107 --> 01:00.775
Come here.

01:00.776 --> 01:02.443
I'm fine, let go!

01:02.444 --> 01:04.361
Fine, like you're a mess fine?

01:04.363 --> 01:06.581
Tina, Boyz 4 Now is your thing.

01:06.582 --> 01:08.032
I could care less.

01:08.033 --> 01:10.117
But remember when
we went to the concert

01:10.118 --> 01:11.953
and you kind of lost your mind?

01:11.954 --> 01:14.755
Listen, some freak thing
happened to me at that concert

01:14.756 --> 01:17.258
but then I slapped Boo Boo's
face and now I'm cured.

01:17.259 --> 01:18.709
Slap therapy, Tina.

01:18.710 --> 01:19.709
Ask your doctor.

01:19.711 --> 01:21.796
She's happy and slappy!

01:21.797 --> 01:23.798
Well, I'm glad to hear that...
‭Thanks.

01:23.799 --> 01:25.800
But the Boyz 4 Now
fan club I belong to

01:25.801 --> 01:27.635
is having an emergency
meeting after school.

01:27.636 --> 01:29.470
It would mean a lot
if you went with me.

01:29.471 --> 01:31.138
Why would I go with you, Tina?

01:31.139 --> 01:32.640
Did you not hear me just now?

01:32.641 --> 01:34.141
I did, it's just...

01:34.142 --> 01:36.258
I could really use some
sister support today.

01:36.311 --> 01:38.278
I think she means from you.

01:38.313 --> 01:39.814
Okay, Tina, I'll come.

01:39.815 --> 01:41.315
Thanks, Louise.

01:41.316 --> 01:43.067
Who wants to join
my Tater Tot club?

01:43.068 --> 01:45.767
We're meeting right now!

01:47.906 --> 01:49.323
What's he doing out there?

01:49.324 --> 01:50.323
Maybe he's wondering
the same thing

01:50.375 --> 01:51.791
about us, Bob.

01:51.827 --> 01:53.627
Yes, this is the place.

01:53.662 --> 01:55.079
Hi, can we help you?

01:55.080 --> 01:56.079
Ah, that corner.

01:56.131 --> 01:57.665
That's where he got shot.

01:57.666 --> 01:58.833
Shot?!
Who got shot?

01:58.834 --> 02:00.000
Somebody got shot?!

02:00.085 --> 02:02.669
Yes, The Grunt got
shot right there.

02:02.754 --> 02:04.055
Who's The Grunt?
What the hell's a grunt?

02:04.056 --> 02:06.007
Dominic "The Grunt" Gruntanno,

02:06.008 --> 02:07.675
one of the biggest bootleggers

02:07.676 --> 02:09.676
on this stretch of coast,
and he was gunned down

02:09.678 --> 02:12.179
right here in 1931.

02:12.180 --> 02:13.346
That's pretty interesting.

02:13.432 --> 02:14.565
Here, have a look

02:14.566 --> 02:15.766
at the crime scene photo.

02:15.767 --> 02:16.933
Whoa. Ugh!

02:17.019 --> 02:18.402
Aw, and it looks like

02:18.403 --> 02:19.486
he just got his steak.

02:19.521 --> 02:20.905
Whoever shot him was good

02:20.906 --> 02:22.522
at shooting someone a lot.

02:22.607 --> 02:24.158
I'm Dr. Donald Wallace,

02:24.159 --> 02:25.576
and I'm researching a book

02:25.577 --> 02:27.361
on this area during Prohibition.

02:27.362 --> 02:29.280
This restaurant is a big find.

02:29.281 --> 02:31.198
Do you want me to try
to get you a plaque?

02:31.199 --> 02:33.366
I'm on the board at
the Historical Society.

02:33.418 --> 02:35.036
I love plaques!

02:35.037 --> 02:36.671
It's like jewelry for buildings.

02:36.672 --> 02:38.755
Uh, I-I don't know if
we need a-a plaque.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.458
Bob, take the plaque!

02:40.459 --> 02:42.093
All the best restaurants
and benches have plaques.

02:42.094 --> 02:44.095
Ooh, I love benches.

02:44.096 --> 02:45.463
Bob, take the plaque.

02:45.464 --> 02:47.097
We'll be like a bench.
Oh, my God.

02:47.182 --> 02:49.133
This is where
we have the meetings.

02:49.134 --> 02:50.383
It's Krissy's house.

02:50.435 --> 02:51.435
She's president of the fan club.

02:51.436 --> 02:52.720
Great, great.

02:52.721 --> 02:53.938
If you get emotional in there

02:53.939 --> 02:55.056
and need a break, let me know.

02:55.057 --> 02:56.724
Not gonna happen, but thanks.

02:56.725 --> 02:58.225
Also, this is a shoes-off house,

02:58.226 --> 02:59.894
so do your best to act
like that's not weird.

03:00.896 --> 03:02.396
Hello, Tina.

03:02.397 --> 03:03.447
Krissy!

03:03.448 --> 03:04.532
Shoes go here, right?

03:04.533 --> 03:06.233
Here they go.

03:06.234 --> 03:09.236
Whoa, depression is in session.

03:09.237 --> 03:11.122
Everybody, this is
my sister, Louise.

03:11.123 --> 03:12.456
She's sitting
in with us tonight.

03:12.457 --> 03:13.708
Oh, welcome, Louise.

03:13.709 --> 03:14.909
I'm Krissy.

03:14.910 --> 03:16.543
My favorite Boy 4 Now
is Griffin.

03:16.578 --> 03:19.046
Ashley, favorite boy, Alan.

03:19.047 --> 03:21.082
Robin, favorite boy
formerly Boo Boo,

03:21.083 --> 03:23.800
Anybody But Boo Boo.

03:23.885 --> 03:25.586
Carly, Griffin.

03:25.587 --> 03:27.004
Becca, Alan.

03:29.257 --> 03:30.925
I'll go.
I'm Krissy's dad.

03:30.926 --> 03:32.643
Favorite boy depends on my mood.

03:32.644 --> 03:34.595
Usually it's Matt,
but in dark times like these,

03:34.596 --> 03:35.813
Griffin's really
my guy as far as...

03:35.814 --> 03:37.264
Shh, shh, not
your moment, honey.

03:37.265 --> 03:38.983
We're all hurting.
Everyone's hurting.

03:38.984 --> 03:40.735
Okay, everybody,
let's get started.

03:40.736 --> 03:42.986
First I'd like to say,
what the fudge, right?!

03:45.991 --> 03:47.858
Who the hell does
Boo Boo think he is?!

03:47.859 --> 03:49.493
Honey... ‭ No, sorry.

03:49.494 --> 03:50.777
We were all thinking it. ‭Yeah.

03:50.862 --> 03:51.996
Official motion to boycott

03:51.997 --> 03:53.197
Boo Boo's solo album

03:53.198 --> 03:54.998
and all future merchandise.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.534
I second.
I third.

03:56.535 --> 03:57.534
The motion passes.

03:57.619 --> 03:58.753
Noted.
Sorry, Louise.

03:58.754 --> 04:00.454
No skin off my butt.

04:00.455 --> 04:02.289
Before we continue,
I want to show you something.

04:02.290 --> 04:04.625
As fan club president,
I receive special, exclusive

04:04.626 --> 04:07.294
e-mails from Boyz 4 Now
and select corporate partners.

04:07.295 --> 04:08.879
Some pretty deep discounts
on merch.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.347
Snap up the T-shirts, guys.

04:10.348 --> 04:12.133
Today's e-mail came
with a video.

04:12.134 --> 04:13.217
Boo Boo!

04:13.218 --> 04:14.634
I mean... I don't care.

04:14.686 --> 04:16.137
Hey, Boo Boo Boosters.

04:16.137 --> 04:17.521
I miss your smiles.

04:17.522 --> 04:18.555
A lot has happened lately.

04:18.557 --> 04:19.890
I've grown as an artist

04:19.891 --> 04:21.308
and also in my body.

04:21.309 --> 04:22.893
It was time for me
to spread my wings

04:22.894 --> 04:24.728
and fly away from Boyz 4 Now.

04:24.729 --> 04:26.947
Matt, you're like a dad to me
'cause you're so old.

04:26.948 --> 04:28.982
Griffin, Alan,
you know what you did.

04:29.034 --> 04:31.285
Boo, boo!

04:31.286 --> 04:32.736
Wait, that's confusing.

04:32.737 --> 04:34.321
Are you saying "boo"
or "Boo Boo"?

04:34.322 --> 04:35.322
"Boo" twice.

04:35.323 --> 04:36.489
God, Ashley, come on.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.075
Anyway, it's all good,

04:38.076 --> 04:39.326
'cause I'm dropping
my first solo album,

04:39.327 --> 04:41.078
Tall Enuff 2 Ride Your Heart.

04:41.079 --> 04:43.214
♪ I'm tall enough
to ride your heart ♪

04:43.215 --> 04:45.715
♪ Keep your arms and lips
inside my car... ♪

04:45.801 --> 04:47.334
Ew, this song is bad.

04:47.335 --> 04:48.502
It's crap!

04:48.503 --> 04:50.386
Awful, pandering crap.
Geez, ah!

04:50.472 --> 04:52.556
To promote the new album,
I'm gonna be kicking it

04:52.557 --> 04:54.057
at some super fun
amusement parks.

04:54.142 --> 04:55.509
He's coming to Wonder Wharf.

04:55.510 --> 04:56.393
Boo Boo's coming
to Wonder Wharf?

04:56.394 --> 04:57.393
Huh, okay.

04:57.429 --> 04:58.729
If you help get the word out,

04:58.730 --> 05:00.231
you and your friends could win

05:00.232 --> 05:01.849
a ride with me on
a grown-up roller coaster

05:01.850 --> 05:04.518
because I am big enough
to ride one, I am!

05:04.519 --> 05:05.653
Me and my friends
could win a ride with him

05:05.654 --> 05:06.853
on a grown-up roller coaster.

05:06.905 --> 05:08.239
Go to my Web site and turn

05:08.240 --> 05:10.324
your Boyz 4 Now fan club
into a Boo Crew,

05:10.325 --> 05:12.443
and the heart I ride
might be yours.

05:12.444 --> 05:14.445
Turn your fan club
into a Boo Crew?

05:14.446 --> 05:16.363
Ugh, we hate Boo Boo!

05:16.364 --> 05:18.199
We hate Boo Boo!

05:18.200 --> 05:19.582
We hate Boo Boo!

05:19.668 --> 05:21.085
We hate Boo Boo!
Great.

05:21.086 --> 05:22.253
We hate Boo Boo!
Lots of fun.

05:22.254 --> 05:23.837
We hate Boo Boo!
So... bye.

05:23.872 --> 05:24.788
Louise?

05:33.765 --> 05:35.933
I'm gonna ride a roller coaster
with you, Boo Boo,

05:35.934 --> 05:38.750
you disgusting, beautiful,
garbage angel.

05:39.705 --> 05:42.281
It happened right here,
kids, right here.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.517
A gangster got plugged
in this corner.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.568
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!

05:45.569 --> 05:46.568
Mm.

05:46.604 --> 05:47.770
Package for Tina.

05:47.855 --> 05:49.521
Oh, Tina, you got a package?

05:49.573 --> 05:51.908
Oh, no, Aunt Gayle's
been saying she's gonna

05:51.909 --> 05:53.276
send me all her old bras.

05:53.277 --> 05:54.277
This must be it.

05:54.278 --> 05:55.412
You'd better share.

05:55.413 --> 05:56.913
Come on, Tina, sign the thing.

05:56.914 --> 05:58.581
The man's got other deliveries.

05:58.582 --> 06:00.700
Pretty heavy, should I help you
carry it up to your room?

06:00.701 --> 06:01.584
Yes, I should.
Come on, let's go.

06:01.585 --> 06:03.419
I got another one here.

06:03.504 --> 06:05.037
Are you gonna give it to us?

06:05.089 --> 06:06.539
I don't know, is it gonna be

06:06.540 --> 06:07.696
a whole long thing
like the last one?

06:07.708 --> 06:09.925
No, no, we'll-we'll
make it pretty quick.

06:10.011 --> 06:12.429
Oh, it's from
the Historical Society.

06:12.430 --> 06:13.670
They must have sent the plaque.

06:13.681 --> 06:15.181
Jealous?
‭I'll live.

06:15.182 --> 06:16.633
I want to be like you, Mike.

06:16.634 --> 06:17.634
You want to be a billionaire

06:17.635 --> 06:19.102
who delivers mail for fun?

06:19.103 --> 06:20.720
What?!
‭Just kidding.

06:20.721 --> 06:22.586
I'm not a billionaire,
but I'm rich in mail.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.140
Get ready, T.

06:24.141 --> 06:25.391
You're gonna love this.

06:25.443 --> 06:26.526
Surprise!

06:26.527 --> 06:28.060
You just joined the Boo Crew!

06:28.112 --> 06:29.195
I didn't sign up for that.

06:29.196 --> 06:30.562
Right, I signed you up,

06:30.648 --> 06:32.198
and Boo Boo's people
sent a package

06:32.199 --> 06:33.900
with everything you
need to get out there

06:33.901 --> 06:35.985
and win that roller
coaster ride!

06:35.986 --> 06:36.985
And best of all?

06:36.987 --> 06:38.121
I'll ride with you.

06:38.122 --> 06:39.572
You know, chaperone.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.574
Make sure you crazy kids
don't get into trouble.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.910
But Boo Boo's the reason
Boyz 4 Now broke up.

06:43.911 --> 06:45.577
I have a Boo Boo
boo boo on my soul.

06:45.663 --> 06:46.963
Why don't you do it without me?

06:46.964 --> 06:48.581
And how would
that work, exactly?

06:48.582 --> 06:49.916
This is your world, T.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.584
Right, but you're the one
who has a crush.

06:51.585 --> 06:52.919
I do not have a crush
on Boo Boo.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.087
I slapped him out of my system!

06:54.088 --> 06:55.337
I slapped him out!

06:55.423 --> 06:57.256
Okay, but at the concert
you were not...

06:57.341 --> 06:58.808
I don't even
remember that concert

06:58.809 --> 07:00.499
and I do not have
dreams about it ever.

07:00.561 --> 07:01.561
Sure, sure.

07:01.562 --> 07:02.729
So, you don't get chills

07:02.730 --> 07:03.930
when you hear Boo Boo sing...

07:03.931 --> 07:06.516
♪ Let me dry your tears ♪

07:06.517 --> 07:08.351
♪ Because you just
pierced your ears ♪

07:08.352 --> 07:09.986
♪ You have tears
in your ears, girl ♪

07:09.987 --> 07:11.176
♪ You have
tears in your ear... ♪

07:11.238 --> 07:12.989
Stop! The line is,

07:12.990 --> 07:14.274
"Are those tears in your ears?"

07:14.275 --> 07:15.608
It's a question!

07:15.609 --> 07:17.277
Whoops.
‭Aha!

07:17.278 --> 07:18.745
Okay, Tina, we can
play the gotcha game,

07:18.746 --> 07:20.497
but here's the truth:

07:20.498 --> 07:23.199
today you don't like Boo Boo,
but tomorrow you might,

07:23.200 --> 07:24.451
and you'll be kicking yourself

07:24.452 --> 07:25.702
for not entering this contest.

07:25.703 --> 07:27.087
What if the fan club finds out?

07:27.088 --> 07:28.088
We took a motion.

07:28.089 --> 07:29.456
We did a chant.

07:29.457 --> 07:30.839
Chants are not legally binding

07:30.925 --> 07:32.208
in our state, okay, Tina?

07:32.209 --> 07:33.626
You're right,
and you're my sister.

07:33.627 --> 07:34.961
I-I want to do this for you.

07:34.962 --> 07:36.513
Okay, we're doing it for you,

07:36.514 --> 07:37.764
but yeah, great, let's do it.

07:37.765 --> 07:39.798
Bobby, think about it.

07:39.884 --> 07:41.633
It could go right here.
I don't know.

07:41.719 --> 07:43.520
Do we really want to be
the murder restaurant?

07:43.521 --> 07:45.805
If it comes with
a plaque like this, sure.

07:45.806 --> 07:47.056
So official.

07:47.057 --> 07:48.308
We're like the White House.

07:48.309 --> 07:49.642
Hey, what are you doing, Bob?

07:49.643 --> 07:50.944
Putting up a warning sign?

07:50.945 --> 07:53.480
Dumb Guy Inside.

07:53.481 --> 07:54.731
Zoom!

07:54.732 --> 07:55.982
Good one, Jimmy.
‭Yeah.

07:55.983 --> 07:58.651
Whoa, there was a mob
hit at this place?

07:58.652 --> 08:00.684
No fair, how did you
get something cool?

08:00.738 --> 08:02.288
Hmm... well, bye.

08:02.289 --> 08:03.873
Hey, I-I-I love mob stuff.

08:03.874 --> 08:06.376
I-I mean the clothes,
the dames, the movies.

08:06.377 --> 08:08.108
Oh, I love the movies!

08:08.162 --> 08:09.379
Okay, see you later.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.080
Johnny Dangerously.

08:11.081 --> 08:13.333
Joe Piscopo in his prime.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.084
Now, that's the movie
that made me

08:15.085 --> 08:16.503
want to be an Italian.

08:16.504 --> 08:18.138
So, you gonna put this,
uh, plaque up or what?

08:18.139 --> 08:19.672
No, we're not.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.341
You're not gonna do anything
at all with this, huh?

08:21.342 --> 08:22.674
Uh... no.

08:22.726 --> 08:24.344
Huh... good to know.

08:24.345 --> 08:26.563
Good to know.

08:26.564 --> 08:29.182
W-Wait, that doesn't mean
you can do something, Jimmy.

08:29.183 --> 08:30.547
Bada bing, Bob.

08:30.601 --> 08:32.518
This is still our mob hit.

08:32.602 --> 08:35.552
I can't hear you over me
saying, "Bada bing, Bob!"

08:35.606 --> 08:36.606
Bada bing.

08:36.607 --> 08:37.690
Linda, stop it.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.159
It's fun to say, it's Italian.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.659
It's not Italian.

08:40.660 --> 08:41.527
Bada bing, Bob.

08:41.578 --> 08:42.976
Bada bing.

08:43.030 --> 08:44.947
Stop saying "Bada bing"!

08:45.032 --> 08:48.034
Boo Boo's coming to
Wonder Wharf this Saturday.

08:48.035 --> 08:49.953
So, the crew that gets
the most sign-ups

08:49.954 --> 08:52.539
for Boo Boo's e-mail list
wins the roller coaster ride.

08:52.540 --> 08:53.706
Am I missing something?

08:53.707 --> 08:54.841
Can it be that easy?

08:54.842 --> 08:56.176
Our Boo Crew is just you and me.

08:56.177 --> 08:57.427
Kind of more of a Boo Two.

08:57.428 --> 08:58.962
Not if we have Gene...

08:58.963 --> 09:00.597
You had me at
"Not if we have Gene."

09:00.598 --> 09:01.786
and that makes three,

09:01.799 --> 09:03.049
and maybe we'll scout around,

09:03.050 --> 09:04.706
fill out the ranks a little bit.

09:06.187 --> 09:07.554
Who's gonna help us?

09:07.555 --> 09:09.210
Right now everyone
hates Boo Boo except us.

09:09.223 --> 09:10.557
It's like that Boyz 4 Now song,

09:10.558 --> 09:12.642
"Girl, Everyone Hates
You Now Except Us."

09:12.643 --> 09:15.395
What we need are a couple
of cold-blooded mercenaries

09:15.396 --> 09:17.396
who will do anything
for the right price.

09:17.481 --> 09:19.532
Now you try it.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.097
Now you try it.

09:21.151 --> 09:22.619
This stuff is great!

09:22.620 --> 09:23.620
Let's try to breathe it!

09:23.621 --> 09:24.621
Okay!

09:26.574 --> 09:29.325
Andy, Ollie, I know you
guys got a lot going on

09:29.326 --> 09:30.910
right now,
but we need your help.

09:30.911 --> 09:32.651
Yay!
‭Yay!

09:34.131 --> 09:35.498
Hello, kind sir, sign up

09:35.499 --> 09:37.300
for Boo Boo's mailing list?

09:37.301 --> 09:39.334
Are you walking away 'cause
you want me to follow you?

09:39.420 --> 09:42.305
We didn't get any e-mails,
but Ollie found a paper clip.

09:42.306 --> 09:43.973
And Andy found
a hundred dollars.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.925
Trade you for
that paper clip. Okay!

09:45.926 --> 09:46.925
Oh, no.
‭What?

09:47.011 --> 09:48.394
It's Krissy.
If she finds out

09:48.395 --> 09:49.417
about our Boo Crew
she'll be... ‭Tina?

09:49.430 --> 09:51.731
Krissy, crazy
running into you here.

09:51.732 --> 09:53.933
Does your shirt say "Boo Crew"?

09:53.934 --> 09:57.820
No, it says, "boo-merang"
because I like boomerangs,

09:57.821 --> 09:59.105
because I'm from Australia.

09:59.106 --> 10:00.440
G'day, mate.
‭Nice.

10:00.441 --> 10:02.441
Move the clipboard for a second?

10:02.493 --> 10:04.494
What clipboard? This clipboard
or your clipboard?

10:04.495 --> 10:06.613
You don't have a clipboard.
Krissy, are you okay?

10:06.614 --> 10:08.581
Look at this
hardworking Boo Crew.

10:08.582 --> 10:09.699
Boo Boo forever, right?

10:09.700 --> 10:10.699
Gene.

10:10.751 --> 10:11.940
Tina, you joined

10:11.952 --> 10:12.835
a Boo Crew?!

10:12.836 --> 10:14.087
What the hell?!

10:14.088 --> 10:15.004
What happened to
my boomerang shirt?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.623
This is actionable.

10:16.624 --> 10:18.124
You're out of the Boyz
4 Now fan club, Tina.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.626
You're out!
‭Krissy, please...

10:19.627 --> 10:21.628
Okay, everyone's
getting a little hot.

10:21.629 --> 10:23.379
We're all just people
wearing T-shirts,

10:23.380 --> 10:24.494
trying to get through the day.

10:24.515 --> 10:25.765
I've made my decision.

10:25.766 --> 10:27.267
Hand over your membership card

10:27.268 --> 10:28.717
and forget the secret handshake.
Forget it!

10:28.802 --> 10:31.054
I lost my membership card,
and I never really knew

10:31.055 --> 10:33.805
the handshake that well to begin
with, it keeps changing, so...

10:33.857 --> 10:35.224
I know it.
How do I know it?

10:35.225 --> 10:36.464
Good-bye, Tina.

10:43.249 --> 10:44.366
Tina?

10:44.367 --> 10:45.499
You with me, girl?

10:45.534 --> 10:46.868
I loved that fan club,

10:46.869 --> 10:48.119
and Krissy just
tossed me aside like

10:48.120 --> 10:50.088
one of Griffin's sweat
towels after he does

10:50.089 --> 10:52.590
the Maniac dance during
the Boyz 4 Now cover of "Maniac,"

10:52.591 --> 10:54.376
which appeared on their covers
album We Got You Covered!

10:54.377 --> 10:55.677
Easy, girl, easy.

10:56.712 --> 10:58.295
I don't know if I can do this.

10:58.381 --> 11:00.382
Whoa, quitting is not an option.

11:00.383 --> 11:01.383
Do you hear me?

11:01.384 --> 11:02.384
Okay, maybe just...

11:02.385 --> 11:03.684
you know, take some Tina time.

11:03.719 --> 11:05.270
Gene, uh, rub her back.

11:05.271 --> 11:06.554
Let me know how my pressure is.

11:08.524 --> 11:09.724
You've sacrificed a lot, Tina.

11:09.725 --> 11:10.725
We all have.

11:10.726 --> 11:11.726
Not really.

11:11.727 --> 11:12.944
Yeah, mostly Tina.

11:12.945 --> 11:14.279
Bup, bup, bup, shh!

11:14.280 --> 11:15.697
We are so close
to winning this thing,

11:15.698 --> 11:16.698
I can just slap it.

11:16.699 --> 11:17.731
I mean, taste it.

11:17.783 --> 11:19.901
What's happening
over at Pesto's?

11:19.902 --> 11:21.201
- Okay, okay, gather around.
- Oh, my God.

11:21.237 --> 11:23.321
I told you he'd do this.

11:23.322 --> 11:25.907
So, recently some kind
of history guy came over

11:25.908 --> 11:27.491
and gave me the best news
of my life.

11:27.576 --> 11:29.911
Back in nineteen-eleventy-seven,

11:29.912 --> 11:33.396
a real-life mobster was gunned
down in my restaurant.

11:33.416 --> 11:35.049
You got to be kidding me, Jimmy!

11:35.084 --> 11:36.751
It happened right here, folks,

11:36.752 --> 11:38.919
in this very establishment.

11:38.971 --> 11:40.221
He's lying!

11:40.222 --> 11:41.589
It happened at my restaurant!

11:41.590 --> 11:42.589
Right over there!

11:42.591 --> 11:44.175
Oh, yeah?

11:44.176 --> 11:45.593
Then how come I'm the one
with the plaque?

11:46.562 --> 11:48.179
He bada-binged us.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.765
"On this spot
in Prohibition times,

11:50.766 --> 11:53.435
"a mobster got
whacked while eating.

11:53.436 --> 11:56.154
This became the basis
for the hit film Dick Tracy."

11:56.155 --> 11:58.523
What?! That's ridiculous!
Hold on, Bob.

11:58.524 --> 12:00.324
The guy from the paper
wants a picture.

12:00.409 --> 12:02.277
Cheese pizza!

12:02.278 --> 12:04.712
Now I'd like to invite
everyone to come in and...

12:04.713 --> 12:07.282
say hello
to my little drink specials!

12:08.284 --> 12:09.451
Rat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat-a-tat.

12:09.452 --> 12:11.503
Rat-a-tat-a-tat-tat-da-da-da.

12:11.504 --> 12:13.588
Jimmy, you can't just put up
a plaque and make it true.

12:13.589 --> 12:15.457
I have history on my side!

12:15.458 --> 12:16.758
Easy, easy, Bob.

12:16.759 --> 12:18.009
It's okay.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.044
History's dumb,
everyone knows it.

12:20.045 --> 12:21.595
It's like,
been there, done that.

12:23.182 --> 12:24.516
I can't believe it.

12:24.517 --> 12:26.518
We've been doing
this for three days.

12:26.519 --> 12:29.220
We haven't gotten a single
e-mail for the mailing list.

12:29.221 --> 12:30.688
People do not seem to trust us

12:30.689 --> 12:32.474
with their personal information.

12:32.475 --> 12:33.755
Here we go,
two live ones coming.

12:33.809 --> 12:35.560
Excuse me, hi!

12:35.561 --> 12:37.145
Do you have a moment
to chat about Boo Boo or...

12:37.146 --> 12:38.780
where are you going?
‭Sorry.

12:38.781 --> 12:39.981
They're getting away!
Blockers, get them!

12:39.982 --> 12:40.982
Windmill arms!

12:42.451 --> 12:43.785
Your loss!

12:43.786 --> 12:45.403
You're really bad at this.

12:45.404 --> 12:46.870
Robin?
‭What do you want?

12:46.956 --> 12:48.573
Look, I shouldn't be here,

12:48.574 --> 12:50.325
but things have gotten
kind of weird in the club.

12:50.326 --> 12:51.793
After Krissy kicked you out,

12:51.794 --> 12:53.077
she called everyone
over to her house

12:53.078 --> 12:54.546
and, I'm not gonna lie, Tina,

12:54.547 --> 12:55.797
some horrible things
were said about you

12:55.798 --> 12:57.081
and Boo Boo.

12:57.082 --> 12:58.833
Mostly about Boo Boo?
Mostly you...

12:58.834 --> 12:59.968
Right, right, right.

12:59.969 --> 13:00.968
And mostly by me,

13:01.003 --> 13:02.137
but here's the thing:

13:02.138 --> 13:03.555
you gave Krissy the idea

13:03.556 --> 13:05.390
to turn the fan club
into a Boo Crew.

13:05.391 --> 13:07.174
Really?
But they hate Boo Boo.

13:07.226 --> 13:08.225
Exactly.

13:08.227 --> 13:09.427
When Krissy suggested

13:09.428 --> 13:10.511
entering Boo Boo's contest,

13:10.563 --> 13:12.012
we were all like, "What?"

13:12.064 --> 13:14.399
But her plan was diabolical.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.351
She said she wanted to win
that roller coaster ride

13:16.352 --> 13:18.653
with Boo Boo, eat a bunch
of junk food at the wharf,

13:18.654 --> 13:22.022
and go from Boo Crew
to Spew Crew.

13:22.074 --> 13:24.359
I like that the last part rhymed

13:24.360 --> 13:26.611
but I don't think
I know what it means.

13:26.612 --> 13:28.196
I mean they're gonna
throw up on Boo Boo.

13:28.197 --> 13:30.031
Oh, no.
‭What?! Yup, they're gonna get

13:30.032 --> 13:31.950
chili...

13:31.951 --> 13:33.868
chili boats... tacos...

13:33.869 --> 13:36.787
taco boats... corn dogs...
Don't say corn dog boats!

13:36.872 --> 13:37.704
Corn dog boats...

13:39.008 --> 13:40.091
and it's all gonna

13:40.092 --> 13:41.458
be on Boo Boo's face.

13:41.544 --> 13:43.044
They're going puke-ular.

13:43.045 --> 13:44.429
Why are you telling us this?

13:44.430 --> 13:45.797
'Cause I used to like Boo Boo

13:45.798 --> 13:47.549
and I don't like
throwing up on people.

13:47.550 --> 13:49.300
I like throwing up on people.

13:49.301 --> 13:51.269
- I mean, I don't love it,
but I'll do it. - Mm.

13:51.270 --> 13:52.604
Boo Boo may have
broken up the band,

13:52.605 --> 13:53.938
but at the end of the day...

13:53.939 --> 13:55.606
Boo Boo was the band.

13:55.691 --> 13:56.691
Exactly.

13:56.692 --> 13:58.359
I mean, hmm, you think so?

13:58.360 --> 14:00.862
Cool perspective and no
wonder people are so upset.

14:00.863 --> 14:03.781
And by the way, Krissy's got,
like, a million sign-ups.

14:03.782 --> 14:05.400
What?! We can't get
anyone to sign up!

14:05.401 --> 14:06.700
How does she do it?

14:06.735 --> 14:08.286
Her Dad signed everyone up

14:08.287 --> 14:09.404
at his company
without them knowing.

14:09.405 --> 14:10.405
It was crazy.

14:10.406 --> 14:11.526
I think he might go to jail.

14:11.540 --> 14:13.074
Krissy and her dad aren't

14:13.075 --> 14:14.374
the only ones
who can play dirty.

14:14.410 --> 14:15.743
Yeah, Krissy's mom, too.

14:15.744 --> 14:17.393
No, I meant us.

14:29.925 --> 14:31.258
Just look at him out there.

14:31.343 --> 14:32.392
Unbelievable.

14:32.428 --> 14:34.062
Forget him, Bob.

14:34.063 --> 14:35.095
You didn't want to put up
the plaque, anyway.

14:35.147 --> 14:36.514
That's not the point!

14:36.515 --> 14:38.683
He's lying, Lin,
he's a total fraud!

14:38.684 --> 14:40.435
Jimmy's not gonna
get away with this.

14:40.436 --> 14:41.603
Bob, what are you gonna do?

14:41.604 --> 14:42.937
I'm gonna call
that history professor.

14:42.938 --> 14:45.405
Oh... tough guy!

14:45.441 --> 14:47.158
We got a lot of sign-ups.

14:47.159 --> 14:48.610
I think we might just
have a shot at this thing.

14:48.611 --> 14:49.744
I mean, you might, Tina.

14:49.745 --> 14:51.029
I-I don't care.

14:51.030 --> 14:52.614
It's okay for you
to be excited, Louise.

14:52.615 --> 14:54.415
Yeah, it's okay
for you to be excited.

14:54.416 --> 14:57.452
Right... listen,
every day at around 2:30,

14:57.453 --> 14:58.785
my armpits get sweaty...

14:58.871 --> 15:00.087
Okay...

15:00.122 --> 15:01.706
and I used to hate

15:01.707 --> 15:03.374
raising my hand in class
to answer a question,

15:03.375 --> 15:05.510
but one day I had to say,
who cares?

15:05.511 --> 15:06.961
I have swampy armpits
and I'm gonna answer

15:06.962 --> 15:08.346
all the questions I want.

15:08.347 --> 15:09.714
I'm swampy and I'm proud.

15:09.715 --> 15:11.382
Tina, where are you
going with this?

15:11.383 --> 15:12.850
I'm saying, just because
you think something

15:12.851 --> 15:14.185
is embarrassing doesn't mean

15:14.186 --> 15:15.603
you have to be
embarrassed by it.

15:15.604 --> 15:17.472
We all have our swampy pits.

15:17.473 --> 15:20.108
My swampy pits is swampy pits.

15:20.109 --> 15:22.277
Maybe your swampy pits
is Boo Boo.

15:22.278 --> 15:24.145
Mm-hmm, have you tried
Dad's deodorant?

15:24.146 --> 15:25.730
It's, like, military grade.

15:25.731 --> 15:27.397
He gets it on the Dark Web.

15:27.483 --> 15:30.451
Good morning, Boo Boo Boosters!

15:30.452 --> 15:32.869
It's a beautiful day
to love Boo Boo!

15:32.955 --> 15:34.622
Oh, I hope we win!

15:34.623 --> 15:35.957
That's what I was hoping, too.

15:35.958 --> 15:37.792
We're going to win.

15:37.793 --> 15:39.744
Boo Squared is gonna
be out here in a bit,

15:39.745 --> 15:42.880
but first let's find out
which lucky Boo Crew won

15:42.881 --> 15:45.799
the Ride a Roller Coaster
with Boo Boo contest!

15:45.834 --> 15:47.885
Ah... the suspense is...

15:47.886 --> 15:49.886
Krissy Davis' crew,
that's who won.

15:49.972 --> 15:51.005
Oh, no!

15:52.424 --> 15:54.174
Hell yes, Krissy!
Hell yes, Krissy!

15:54.259 --> 15:58.095
Sorry, I should have drawn
that out more, made it suspenseful.

15:58.180 --> 16:00.079
No!

16:04.413 --> 16:05.847
All right, let's get the winning

16:05.848 --> 16:07.431
Boo Crew up here onstage!

16:07.466 --> 16:08.449
This can't be right.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.050
Recount, recount!

16:10.119 --> 16:11.986
So, Krissy, you and your crew

16:11.987 --> 16:13.971
are seconds away
from meeting Boo Boo.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.389
How do you feel?

16:16.975 --> 16:18.558
Lovely girl.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.028
Oh, my God.

16:20.029 --> 16:21.396
She's gonna be
so full of corn dogs.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.697
Hey, look out!

16:22.698 --> 16:23.980
She's gonna throw up on Boo Boo!

16:24.033 --> 16:25.033
They're all gonna...

16:25.034 --> 16:27.118
Boo Boo, everybody!

16:27.119 --> 16:28.903
Boo Boo!

16:28.904 --> 16:31.289
Boo Boo's big enough to ride!

16:31.290 --> 16:32.657
Yeah!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.375
Just kissing the line there.

16:34.376 --> 16:36.710
Now let's get these crazy
kids on the roller coaster.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.831
No, no, no, no.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.081
You're not allowed up here.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.582
You don't get it!
They're gonna...

16:44.636 --> 16:46.587
Their puke is on your hands!

16:46.588 --> 16:48.672
I mean, it's gonna be
on his face, but...

16:48.724 --> 16:50.508
Thanks again for
coming, Professor.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.894
So, the plan is, we burst
in there, we get everyone's

16:52.895 --> 16:54.645
attention with the photo,
and then you tell them

16:54.646 --> 16:56.314
where it really happened.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.349
Now I know how Freddie
the Face must have felt

16:58.350 --> 17:00.601
right before taking
out The Grunt.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.070
Where's the plaque, by the way?

17:02.071 --> 17:03.438
You should have
gotten it by now.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.856
Huh, I don't know.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.858
Maybe it got lost in the mail.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.444
I mean, I bet that happens
a lot with, uh, plaques.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.694
You don't know the half of it.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.496
Okay, here we go.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.333
All right, now?

17:15.334 --> 17:16.333
Not yet.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.919
It happened right there.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.337
Can you believe it?

17:19.338 --> 17:21.372
Rat-a-tat-a-tat-
a-tat-a-tat-a-tat.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.839
That's what it sounded like.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.038
See, I'm good at sounds.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.126
Now? Or...

17:25.127 --> 17:27.011
And he's all...

17:27.012 --> 17:28.295
and the blood's going...

17:28.380 --> 17:29.680
wow!

17:29.681 --> 17:31.048
It was like, zoom!

17:32.885 --> 17:34.385
It's the best thing

17:34.386 --> 17:38.189
that's ever happened to me!

17:38.190 --> 17:40.555
Rat-a-tat-a-tat-
a-tat-a-tat-a-tat.

17:41.693 --> 17:43.478
I can't do it.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.979
I've never seen him so happy.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.063
I-I'm calling off the hit.

17:46.064 --> 17:47.115
What?!

17:47.116 --> 17:48.115
I mean, look at him.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.149
H-He needs this.

17:49.234 --> 17:50.735
Taking it away from him

17:50.736 --> 17:51.903
would be like taking a toy

17:51.904 --> 17:54.488
away from a giant, stupid baby.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.456
But he seems like such a jerk.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.325
He is.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.409
He's what we historians

17:58.410 --> 18:00.161
would call a douche bag.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.329
I know.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.547
Here, come back to my place.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.081
I-I'll buy you a burger.

18:04.082 --> 18:06.384
You're my best friend, Bob.

18:06.385 --> 18:08.301
Really?
Uh, okay.

18:08.387 --> 18:11.838
They're having the ride of
their lives up there with Boo Boo!

18:11.924 --> 18:13.090
When's it gonna happen?

18:13.091 --> 18:14.142
When's it gonna happen, Robin?!

18:14.143 --> 18:15.643
I don't know!

18:15.644 --> 18:17.010
I left before Krissy
worked out the details.

18:17.095 --> 18:18.346
Well, it's got to happen soon,

18:18.347 --> 18:19.429
the ride's almost over.

18:19.481 --> 18:21.015
I'm not scared!
I'm not scared!

18:21.016 --> 18:22.232
I'm not scared! I'm not scared!
I'm not scared...

18:22.267 --> 18:23.651
You're crushing it up there,

18:23.652 --> 18:25.936
Boo Boo, crushing it!

18:26.021 --> 18:27.104
That was the last turn.

18:27.105 --> 18:28.439
They're almost done.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.490
Maybe they couldn't throw up

18:29.491 --> 18:31.191
so they just burped in his face.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.443
Oh, my God.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.528
It was never supposed to happen

18:33.529 --> 18:34.579
on the roller coaster.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.863
What do you mean?

18:35.864 --> 18:36.781
A roller coaster
is a horrible place

18:36.782 --> 18:38.166
to barf on someone.

18:38.167 --> 18:39.333
The barf would get everywhere,

18:39.334 --> 18:40.251
it might even miss Boo Boo.

18:40.252 --> 18:41.285
Who's Miss Boo Boo?

18:41.286 --> 18:43.037
Is she our teacher?

18:43.038 --> 18:44.755
All right, time for a photo

18:44.756 --> 18:46.923
with Boo Boo
and the lucky winners.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.008
Out of my way!

18:49.845 --> 18:52.712
Hmm. Ooh. Mm.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.967
Move it!
‭Whoa!

18:55.968 --> 18:58.018
Somebody get this girl
a barf bag!

18:58.103 --> 18:59.303
Step aside.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.521
Okay, come with me.

19:00.522 --> 19:01.689
It's cool, Meredith.

19:01.690 --> 19:02.940
Come on, girls, don't fight.

19:02.941 --> 19:04.191
There's plenty of Boo for you.

19:04.276 --> 19:05.276
Move!

19:05.277 --> 19:06.777
He deserves this!

19:07.779 --> 19:08.980
We hate him!

19:08.981 --> 19:11.031
Everybody hates him!

19:11.116 --> 19:12.700
Not everybody.

19:12.701 --> 19:14.652
I... I like him.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.486
I mean, I hate him
but I like him!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.822
I-I like him a lot
and it's terrible!

19:18.874 --> 19:19.740
That's it, girl.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.825
It makes no sense!

19:20.826 --> 19:22.243
What is he, even?!

19:22.244 --> 19:25.162
He's like a... a piece
of candy with hair.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.999
Or like a boy mixed with
a baby mixed with a girl.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.249
Mixed with an actor,
mixed with an artist,

19:29.334 --> 19:30.468
mixed with a model.

19:30.469 --> 19:31.334
Move!

19:31.420 --> 19:32.670
No, I'm not done,

19:32.671 --> 19:34.338
but just because
he's embarrassing in,

19:34.339 --> 19:36.390
like, every way
I can think of...

19:36.391 --> 19:37.841
Okay, that hurts.
‭Shush!

19:37.893 --> 19:39.010
Just because he's embarrassing

19:39.011 --> 19:40.811
doesn't mean I'm embarrassed.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.313
You hear me, people?

19:42.314 --> 19:45.732
I like Boo Boo!

19:45.817 --> 19:47.184
Yay, Louise.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.352
Oh, swampy pits.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.737
Is it 2:30 already?

19:49.738 --> 19:53.241
Stop... talking...
and... move!

19:53.242 --> 19:54.775
Krissy, I get it.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.110
You thought you'd
always have Boyz 4 Now

19:56.111 --> 19:57.360
and Boo Boo took that away,

19:57.412 --> 19:59.196
but if you barf on Boo Boo,

19:59.197 --> 20:00.581
you barf on yourself, too...

20:00.582 --> 20:02.283
I mean, there's gonna
be splashback...

20:02.284 --> 20:04.201
but also you barf
on the part of you

20:04.202 --> 20:05.869
that liked Boo Boo so much.

20:05.954 --> 20:07.204
Boo Boo's not real.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.506
None of this is real,

20:08.507 --> 20:10.674
but what you felt is real...

20:10.709 --> 20:12.209
and if you barf on it,

20:12.210 --> 20:14.094
then you're gonna
have barf on it.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.381
Maybe... you're right.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.848
Oh, God, I can't hold it!

20:20.636 --> 20:23.520
Okay, can we get a whole bunch
of napkins over here?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.139
You're doing the right thing,
Krissy.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.807
You know, we've
had our differences,

20:26.808 --> 20:29.277
but I guess it's time for me
to rejoin the fan club.

20:29.278 --> 20:30.895
Okay.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.063
Great, could you show me

20:32.064 --> 20:33.064
the secret handshake,
because...?

20:33.065 --> 20:34.732
Okay, you're busy.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.568
So, here we are again,
face to face.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.819
What do you mean again?

20:38.820 --> 20:40.371
Eh, you might not remember.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.123
Do you remember this?

20:42.124 --> 20:43.708
Oh, my God, how are you?

20:43.709 --> 20:45.459
Okay, let's get you out of here.

20:45.460 --> 20:47.127
Bye, girls, bye!

20:47.212 --> 20:49.080
Can't wait to hear the album!

20:49.081 --> 20:50.381
I'm proud of you, Louise.

20:50.382 --> 20:51.749
Ugh, he's the worst.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.913
I miss him so much.
