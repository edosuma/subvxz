WEBVTT

00:01.414 --> 00:03.381
Gene, breakfast. Yum!

00:03.416 --> 00:04.449
Sorry I took so long,

00:04.484 --> 00:05.650
but I think you'll agree

00:05.685 --> 00:07.218
it was worth the wait.

00:07.254 --> 00:08.653
Ooh, yes.

00:08.688 --> 00:10.670
Why are you wearing your fancy clothes?

00:10.695 --> 00:12.257
Why aren't you wearing yours?

00:12.292 --> 00:14.795
- These are my fancy clothes.
- Mm.

00:14.820 --> 00:17.662
Gene's all dressed up for
the school-wide mock trial.

00:17.687 --> 00:18.997
He's the big, tough prosecutor.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.549
Oh, right. Right.

00:20.585 --> 00:22.718
I'm a sharp-dressed,
silver-tongued devil.

00:22.754 --> 00:24.653
And he's going up against Louise,

00:24.689 --> 00:26.355
the savvy defense lawyer.

00:26.391 --> 00:28.157
It's Belcher against Belcher!

00:28.192 --> 00:29.492
Whoop-Dee-Doo!

00:29.527 --> 00:30.659
We win either way!

00:30.695 --> 00:31.839
It is impressive that our kids

00:31.863 --> 00:33.195
got chosen to be the lawyers.

00:33.231 --> 00:35.234
It really is. Also, totally random.

00:35.259 --> 00:36.966
Yep. Literally picked out of a hat.

00:37.001 --> 00:39.568
And we can't forget the
most important role of all...

00:39.604 --> 00:41.007
Tina the juror!

00:41.032 --> 00:43.072
With great jury comes
great responsibility.

00:43.107 --> 00:44.473
You lucked out, T.

00:44.509 --> 00:46.375
I wish I could sit on
the jury and zone out

00:46.411 --> 00:48.377
while we do a mock trial of Snow White.

00:48.413 --> 00:51.213
Whoa, do you think the Evil Queen

00:51.249 --> 00:53.582
gave Snow White a poison apple?

00:53.618 --> 00:54.185
Yes!

00:54.210 --> 00:55.885
That's for a jury of
her peers to decide.

00:55.920 --> 00:56.920
But probably.

00:56.954 --> 00:58.220
It's just so babyish.

00:58.256 --> 00:59.533
I mean, why can't we do a mock trial

00:59.557 --> 01:01.157
of a double homicide or something?

01:01.192 --> 01:03.859
Ooh, double homicide. Twice as nice!

01:04.281 --> 01:05.661
Okay, everyone,

01:05.696 --> 01:08.497
Judge Conklin is just outside,
and he's ready to begin.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.933
He's retired, but today
he's going to hear our case

01:10.968 --> 01:12.435
and guide us through the process.

01:12.477 --> 01:14.077
- I want to be Snow White.
- _

01:14.105 --> 01:15.271
- Uh, snow way.
- _

01:15.306 --> 01:16.405
Bailiff Zeke,

01:16.441 --> 01:17.451
why don't you get us started?

01:17.475 --> 01:19.075
Hear ye, hear ye!

01:19.110 --> 01:21.210
The court of the Honorable Judge Conklin

01:21.245 --> 01:22.511
is now in session.

01:22.547 --> 01:24.046
- All rise.
- Honorable?

01:24.089 --> 01:26.589
I haven't been called that since 1997.

01:26.617 --> 01:28.017
Maybe you should call me

01:28.052 --> 01:30.019
the "somewhat
respectable" Judge Conklin.

01:30.054 --> 01:32.588
He's funny!

01:32.623 --> 01:35.458
Ooh, the somewhat wet
and messy Judge Conklin.

01:35.493 --> 01:37.960
I had a little accident.
Just water, not pee.

01:37.995 --> 01:40.262
God, this guy's got no filter.

01:40.298 --> 01:41.564
Be seated!

01:41.599 --> 01:43.599
It's gonna be a long day.

01:43.634 --> 01:45.067
- Okay, here we go.
- _

01:45.103 --> 01:46.702
We will first hear from the prosecution.

01:46.737 --> 01:49.705
Your Honor, ladies and
gentleman of the jury,

01:49.740 --> 01:51.807
here are the facts: the Evil Queen

01:51.843 --> 01:53.409
was jealous of my client, the gorgeous,

01:53.444 --> 01:55.089
but-a-little-sun-wouldn't-
kill-her Snow White,

01:55.113 --> 01:56.879
and gave her a poison apple, sending her

01:56.914 --> 01:58.147
into a sleeping death.

01:58.182 --> 02:00.049
To sum it up, not cool.

02:00.084 --> 02:03.052
So do your thing and
return a verdict of guilty.

02:03.087 --> 02:05.588
Okay, counterpoint: she's not guilty.

02:05.623 --> 02:06.623
Thank you.

02:06.657 --> 02:07.990
- Louise?
- Yes ma'am?

02:08.025 --> 02:09.458
If you don't want to participate,

02:09.494 --> 02:11.003
then you can just write
a thousand-word essay

02:11.027 --> 02:13.062
on the legal system, due tomorrow.

02:13.097 --> 02:14.430
What am I supposed to do?

02:14.465 --> 02:16.465
I mean, her first name is "Evil."

02:16.501 --> 02:18.734
- Louise...
- Ugh! Fine.

02:19.837 --> 02:20.981
You know any places that make

02:21.005 --> 02:22.138
good food, Bob?

02:22.173 --> 02:24.306
Uh, yeah, Mort, why?

02:24.342 --> 02:26.909
I'm hosting my mom's birthday
party, and I need a caterer.

02:26.944 --> 02:30.112
Oh, okay. So... us? Bob's Burgers?

02:30.148 --> 02:31.280
Oh, God no!

02:31.315 --> 02:32.915
Geez, Mort. Yeah, what the hell?

02:32.950 --> 02:34.283
If I was having a funeral,

02:34.318 --> 02:35.985
I'd get my dead bodies from your place.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.587
No, no, no, no, don't get
me wrong, it's not you.

02:38.623 --> 02:40.289
It's just that my mom's picky.

02:40.324 --> 02:42.166
If it doesn't have a shrimp
on it, she won't eat it.

02:42.191 --> 02:44.827
Uh, I love your food,
too... Sorry to interrupt...

02:44.862 --> 02:47.814
But I found something in it
that I don't love... this.

02:48.466 --> 02:50.599
Oh, God! Can we make you another one?

02:50.635 --> 02:52.535
Yeah, I'm not sure I
could eat another burger.

02:52.570 --> 02:53.769
I'll take it.

02:53.804 --> 02:55.204
Look, we're really sorry about this.

02:55.239 --> 02:57.039
Let us um... let us comp your meal.

02:57.074 --> 02:58.541
No, no. Are you sure?

02:58.576 --> 02:59.675
Yes. We insist.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.009
Well, in that case, thank you.

03:01.034 --> 03:02.900
Have a great day!

03:03.080 --> 03:05.848
Huh. This is a brown hair. That's weird.

03:05.883 --> 03:07.116
Makes me wonder how much hair

03:07.151 --> 03:08.551
I've eaten here over the years.

03:08.586 --> 03:10.219
Probably a whole mullet's worth.

03:10.254 --> 03:12.354
Worth it.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.357
So, you're a charming prince, huh?

03:15.393 --> 03:16.725
- Yes, I am.
- _

03:16.761 --> 03:18.727
And what kind of charmer goes around

03:18.763 --> 03:20.196
kissing dead girls?

03:20.231 --> 03:21.497
I was trying to revive her

03:21.532 --> 03:22.731
with my true-love kiss.

03:22.767 --> 03:23.899
Get off my back!

03:23.935 --> 03:25.467
How many corpses did you kiss

03:25.503 --> 03:27.870
before you found your Snow White, Romeo?

03:27.905 --> 03:29.471
- None.
- How many?!

03:29.507 --> 03:30.472
- One.
- How many?!

03:30.508 --> 03:31.473
- Four!
- How many?!

03:31.509 --> 03:32.474
I don't know!

03:32.510 --> 03:33.475
Why don't you think?!

03:33.511 --> 03:35.010
Ms. Jacobson, help!

03:35.046 --> 03:36.378
Order! Order!

03:36.414 --> 03:38.180
Are you going somewhere
with this, Counselor?

03:38.216 --> 03:39.481
No, not really, I just wanted

03:39.517 --> 03:40.849
to upset the witness, Your Honor.

03:40.885 --> 03:42.551
- Looks like you did it.
- I did it, yeah.

03:42.587 --> 03:43.919
If there are no further questions,

03:43.955 --> 03:45.654
it's time for the jury to deliberate.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.323
All right, then, I guess

03:47.358 --> 03:49.024
I ask for a mistrial.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.227
It's impossible for my
client, the Evil Queen,

03:51.262 --> 03:52.695
to get a fair trial here because

03:52.730 --> 03:54.830
everyone knows the story of Snow White.

03:54.865 --> 03:57.766
Huh. No one has ever
asked for a mistrial.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.201
So you'll grant me one?

03:59.226 --> 04:01.670
No. The jury seems
impartial and capable.

04:01.706 --> 04:03.739
And mysterious, with a hint of glamor.

04:03.774 --> 04:05.908
Jury, how do you find the defendant?

04:05.943 --> 04:08.777
The impartial, capable,
mysterious and glamorous jury

04:08.813 --> 04:11.013
rules in favor of the prosecution.

04:11.048 --> 04:12.615
We find the Evil Queen guilty.

04:12.650 --> 04:14.783
- Shocking.
- Sweet Lady Justice!

04:14.810 --> 04:16.009
No, I didn't!

04:16.053 --> 04:18.286
- Yes, you did!
- I-I did not!

04:18.322 --> 04:19.555
What is going on?

04:19.589 --> 04:21.557
Mr. Frond stole my yogurt!

04:21.591 --> 04:23.392
Look! This is his trash can.

04:23.427 --> 04:24.693
Gasp! Right?

04:24.729 --> 04:26.562
I did not eat that yogurt.

04:26.597 --> 04:28.364
It's a crime of passion fruit!

04:28.399 --> 04:29.798
Sounds like you need a lawyer.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.700
Hey, let's try this in student court!

04:31.736 --> 04:33.035
We've already got a judge.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.237
Oh, I mean, we were gonna try

04:35.273 --> 04:36.571
the Three Little Pigs tomorrow.

04:36.596 --> 04:38.607
I'm fine taking this to student court.

04:38.643 --> 04:40.409
Let the whole school
see that Mr. Frond is

04:40.444 --> 04:41.744
a dirty yogurt thief!

04:41.779 --> 04:43.612
I am not a thief!

04:43.648 --> 04:45.648
I'd be happy to take
this to student court.

04:45.683 --> 04:47.483
Well, I'd preside over this case.

04:47.518 --> 04:48.951
Maybe the fairy tale trials are

04:48.986 --> 04:50.753
- too predictable.
- You think?

04:50.788 --> 04:52.499
Let's see what they
can do with a real case.

04:52.523 --> 04:54.923
Well, if everyone's on board, I guess

04:54.959 --> 04:56.292
we can try this one tomorrow.

04:56.327 --> 04:57.893
We won't need re-enactors,

04:57.928 --> 05:00.095
so Jimmy Jr., Tammy and Jocelyn

05:00.131 --> 05:01.131
can join the jury.

05:01.165 --> 05:02.765
Jimmy Jr. on the jury?

05:02.800 --> 05:05.167
Jimmy Jury... I know who I
want to get sequestered with.

05:05.202 --> 05:06.302
He's my sequestiny.

05:06.337 --> 05:07.736
- What?
- Nothing.

05:07.772 --> 05:09.638
What happens when you find Frond guilty?

05:09.674 --> 05:11.363
Does this school have the death penalty?

05:11.388 --> 05:14.476
How about if the jury finds him guilty,

05:14.512 --> 05:16.445
he has to wear a sign all day that says,

05:16.480 --> 05:18.314
"I'm a disgusting yogurt thief."

05:18.349 --> 05:19.782
Ha, yes!

05:19.817 --> 05:21.750
And, if he's found innocent,

05:21.786 --> 05:23.952
then you have to wear a
sign all day that reads,

05:23.988 --> 05:25.621
"I'm a filthy liar mouth."

05:25.656 --> 05:27.589
- Perfect!
- Tammy and I will make the signs.

05:27.625 --> 05:28.991
It's gonna be so fun.

05:29.026 --> 05:30.504
Jocelyn, will you please
make my sign for me?

05:30.528 --> 05:31.794
- Okay.
- Thank you.

05:31.829 --> 05:33.595
So we'll keep Zeke as the bailiff,

05:33.631 --> 05:34.797
Gene, you'll be prosecuting,

05:34.832 --> 05:36.865
and, Louise, since you were finally

05:36.901 --> 05:38.434
making some progress as a defender,

05:38.469 --> 05:39.868
you get to defend Mr. Frond.

05:39.904 --> 05:41.048
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

05:41.072 --> 05:44.340
- No, no.
- Ugh!

05:46.000 --> 05:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:56.874 --> 05:59.161
Look, I don't like you,
and you don't like me,

05:59.186 --> 06:01.153
but I guess I'm responsible
for your defense.

06:01.188 --> 06:03.121
Yes, that's scary, but I'm sure

06:03.157 --> 06:04.567
you'll do everything in your power...

06:04.591 --> 06:05.824
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:05.859 --> 06:07.559
I was gonna go the other way with it.

06:07.594 --> 06:09.995
All you got to do is cop a
plea so we can get out of here.

06:10.030 --> 06:11.730
You'll be home in time
to talk to your cats

06:11.765 --> 06:13.198
and knit yourself to sleep.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.700
No, no, no, no, no.
No deal, I'm innocent.

06:15.736 --> 06:17.836
Who cares! Just say you did it,

06:17.871 --> 06:19.738
buy him a yogurt, and we're done here.

06:19.773 --> 06:20.773
I'm innocent!

06:20.808 --> 06:22.174
Don't hiss at me.

06:22.209 --> 06:23.975
All rise for the somewhat respectable

06:24.011 --> 06:25.343
Judge Conklin.

06:25.379 --> 06:26.745
I guess I brought that on myself.

06:26.780 --> 06:29.181
Today, you, the jury, will hear the case

06:29.216 --> 06:31.249
of Mr. Ambrose v. Mr. Frond,

06:31.285 --> 06:33.251
one of whom will wear the hilarious sign

06:33.287 --> 06:34.486
- we discussed yesterday.
- _

06:34.521 --> 06:36.154
The signs look really good.

06:36.190 --> 06:38.123
- They're fine.
- They look really good.

06:38.192 --> 06:39.558
They're just fine.

06:39.593 --> 06:41.693
I should instruct the jury

06:41.728 --> 06:44.996
that until the trial is over,
you may not discuss the case.

06:45.032 --> 06:47.065
Whoa. Forbidden conversation.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.867
So, how about this case, huh?

06:48.936 --> 06:50.168
- What?
- I know. We shouldn't.

06:50.204 --> 06:51.603
We mustn't.

06:51.628 --> 06:52.998
I-I don't,
I-I can't...

06:53.023 --> 06:54.322
What-what are you saying?

06:54.347 --> 06:55.540
Exactly.

06:55.576 --> 06:58.109
Let's begin with the opening statements.

06:58.145 --> 07:00.278
As far back as I can remember,

07:00.314 --> 07:02.414
Mr. Ambrose has been hollerin' on

07:02.449 --> 07:04.583
about Mr. Frond stealin' his yogurt.

07:04.618 --> 07:05.884
Why is he talking like that?

07:05.919 --> 07:08.386
Problem was there wasn't no proof!

07:08.422 --> 07:11.256
But now, we have more
evidence than an alligator

07:11.291 --> 07:14.559
with a full belly next to
an empty crawfish bucket.

07:14.595 --> 07:16.528
I don't understand what he's saying.

07:16.563 --> 07:17.729
Can I interrupt here?

07:17.764 --> 07:18.930
The court asks that you use

07:18.966 --> 07:20.565
your normal speaking voice.

07:20.601 --> 07:22.367
I mean, personally, I really like it,

07:22.402 --> 07:23.446
but it's confusing the jury.

07:23.470 --> 07:24.870
Oh, boo.

07:24.905 --> 07:27.906
Mr. Ambrose's yogurt container was found

07:27.941 --> 07:29.875
in Mr. Frond's trash can.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.943
End of story. I'm good at law!

07:31.979 --> 07:33.445
Applause. Applause!

07:33.480 --> 07:35.447
Ladies and gentleman of the jury,

07:35.482 --> 07:36.948
maybe he didn't do it.

07:36.984 --> 07:38.416
Huh? Good night.

07:38.452 --> 07:40.318
That's it? That's all you got?!

07:40.354 --> 07:41.831
Oh, we also have a
right to a speedy trial,

07:41.855 --> 07:43.321
so let's get this going, huh?

07:43.357 --> 07:45.724
Hey, that guy looks familiar.

07:45.759 --> 07:47.392
- Bob, that's Teddy.
- Hi, Bob.

07:47.427 --> 07:49.261
No, out the window.
I think that's the guy

07:49.296 --> 07:51.463
who found the hair in
his burger here yesterday.

07:51.498 --> 07:52.931
Yeah, I think it is.

07:52.966 --> 07:55.667
Hey, Jimmy, did that guy
find a hair in his food?

07:55.702 --> 07:57.302
What? Don't yell that across the street!

07:57.337 --> 07:59.076
I'm over here, come on!

07:59.101 --> 08:01.239
That guy was in my
place yesterday, Jimmy.

08:01.275 --> 08:03.441
Let me guess, he found
a hair on his last bite,

08:03.477 --> 08:05.477
- and you comped his meal?
- Yeah.

08:05.512 --> 08:08.079
- That guy is a scammer.
- What a jerk!

08:08.115 --> 08:09.981
Lin, who is watching the restaurant?

08:10.017 --> 08:11.449
Mort and Teddy.

08:11.485 --> 08:13.184
I can't believe that guy was scamming.

08:13.253 --> 08:15.420
He seemed nice... we were
jib-jabbing about his job.

08:15.455 --> 08:16.488
Don't say jib-jabbing.

08:16.523 --> 08:17.789
Wait, where does he work?

08:17.824 --> 08:19.524
He's, like, a celebrity impersonator.

08:19.559 --> 08:21.026
Like, you rent him for parties.

08:21.061 --> 08:22.827
He gave me a free taste of his Pacino.

08:22.863 --> 08:24.429
It was eye-opening.

08:24.464 --> 08:26.097
Well, maybe we can track him down.

08:26.166 --> 08:28.628
Oh, you want to get back at him, huh?

08:28.653 --> 08:30.956
- Yeah.
- Shave his head, cook his hair

08:30.981 --> 08:32.003
and feed it to him?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.371
N-No...

08:33.407 --> 08:34.683
Replace all the shoes in his house

08:34.707 --> 08:36.174
with shoes one size smaller.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.542
We Amélie the guy.

08:37.577 --> 08:39.277
Teddy, is there anyone
in the restaurant?

08:39.313 --> 08:41.346
Mort. Oh, nope. There he is.

08:41.381 --> 08:43.481
Something's burning!

08:43.517 --> 08:45.884
- That's where you ate the yogurt,
- _

08:45.919 --> 08:48.119
but it wasn't yo gurt, was it?!

08:48.155 --> 08:50.388
- No!
- Aha! You admit you ate it!

08:50.424 --> 08:53.792
No, I'm saying it wasn't my
'gurt, and I didn't eat it.

08:53.827 --> 08:56.194
Yes, you did. No further
questions. Gotcha!

08:56.229 --> 08:58.697
So you walked from here to there.

08:58.732 --> 09:00.665
When, exactly, did you eat the yogurt?

09:00.701 --> 09:03.401
I didn't eat the yogurt!

09:03.437 --> 09:04.502
I'm satisfied.

09:04.538 --> 09:05.971
Uh Louise?

09:06.006 --> 09:07.472
I hate to be that guy,

09:07.507 --> 09:09.007
but you have an obligation

09:09.042 --> 09:10.675
to provide this man with a defense.

09:10.711 --> 09:12.410
Working with what I got, Your Honor.

09:12.446 --> 09:14.346
Let's get this party started.

09:14.381 --> 09:16.147
I call to the stand Ms. Selbo!

09:16.183 --> 09:17.573
Hey, Jimmy Junior, do you think

09:17.598 --> 09:19.017
he's gonna lead this witness or what?

09:19.042 --> 09:21.163
Stop it, Tina, you're
gonna get us in trouble.

09:21.188 --> 09:22.721
Guilty as charged.

09:22.756 --> 09:26.157
So, Ms. Selbo, you are a receptionista?

09:26.193 --> 09:28.226
I'm the school receptionist, yes.

09:28.261 --> 09:29.694
And a person in your position

09:29.730 --> 09:31.529
must see and hear a lot of things.

09:31.565 --> 09:32.897
Sitting at the front desk,

09:32.933 --> 09:35.333
watching the race of mankind go by?

09:35.369 --> 09:36.835
Yes, but I'm very discreet.

09:36.870 --> 09:39.089
What do you know about
Misters Ambrose and Frond?

09:39.114 --> 09:40.505
Where to begin?

09:40.540 --> 09:43.274
Mr. Frond gets a call from
his mother at least once a day.

09:43.310 --> 09:44.676
Oh, there's a surprise.

09:44.711 --> 09:46.411
And Mr. Ambrose uses the computer room

09:46.446 --> 09:48.580
after hours to work on his
sequel to Mrs. Doubtfire...

09:48.615 --> 09:50.015
"Mrs. Doubtwater."

09:50.050 --> 09:52.017
It's a prequel, you ass!

09:52.052 --> 09:54.027
Okay, everyone, okay, I think it's best

09:54.052 --> 09:56.605
we just keep this focused
on the yogurt case for now.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.689
Ms. Selbo,

09:57.724 --> 09:59.791
do you have any 'gurt-related gossip?

09:59.818 --> 10:01.118
Any hot 'gurt goss?

10:01.161 --> 10:02.627
Well, Mr. Ambrose is always leaving

10:02.662 --> 10:04.262
his yogurt spoons lying around.

10:04.297 --> 10:07.065
Wait, what do you mean he
leaves them lying around?

10:07.100 --> 10:09.434
These yogurts have a
plastic spoon in the lid,

10:09.469 --> 10:10.969
for the yogurt eater on the go.

10:11.004 --> 10:13.805
Yeah, or a yogurt thief
on the go, like Mr. Frond!

10:13.840 --> 10:15.540
Look at the yogurt container!

10:15.575 --> 10:17.242
The spoon is still in the lid!

10:17.277 --> 10:18.810
- How did I eat it?
- Hmm.

10:18.845 --> 10:21.312
Probably with your
tongue, like a dirty frog!

10:21.348 --> 10:24.282
Impossible... I have
a tiny tongue, see?!

10:24.317 --> 10:26.313
Ew, put that away!

10:27.254 --> 10:29.235
- So this is the Internet.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.488
Scroll back up. There he is!

10:30.524 --> 10:32.223
Bingo! We got you, buddy.

10:32.259 --> 10:34.759
Austin Powers, Mario or Luigi?

10:34.795 --> 10:37.062
Hey! Borat! Let's get that one!

10:37.097 --> 10:38.663
This isn't supposed to be fun, Teddy.

10:38.698 --> 10:40.343
- Why not?
- 'Cause we're getting revenge.

10:40.368 --> 10:42.233
We're gonna do to him what he did to us,

10:42.269 --> 10:44.069
make him work and then not pay.

10:44.104 --> 10:45.737
Ooh, he's available tomorrow.

10:45.772 --> 10:46.983
Wait, what are we just gonna book him?

10:47.007 --> 10:48.306
I mean, he'd recognize us.

10:48.341 --> 10:49.941
He isn't gonna recognize my mother.

10:49.976 --> 10:51.087
Which is why we're gonna book him

10:51.111 --> 10:52.328
for her birthday party.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.524
So Mort, are you sure
this won't ruin her party?

10:54.548 --> 10:55.958
Are you kidding? This
is her kind of thing.

10:55.982 --> 10:57.182
She loves revenge.

10:57.217 --> 10:58.616
Revenge and shrimp.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.252
Look, it's no use.

11:01.288 --> 11:02.620
That spoon thing went nowhere.

11:02.656 --> 11:04.456
So time to cop a plea, okay?

11:04.491 --> 11:05.690
But I didn't do it.

11:05.725 --> 11:07.158
Falsely accused, huh?

11:07.194 --> 11:09.154
I've been there. All the time.

11:09.179 --> 11:10.128
By you.

11:10.163 --> 11:11.529
All the time? Really?

11:11.565 --> 11:14.699
Well, some of the times.
Yeah, really, Mr. Frond.

11:14.734 --> 11:18.336
Well, if I ever did falsely accuse
you of anything, I'm sorry.

11:18.371 --> 11:19.938
'Cause this feels really horrible.

11:19.973 --> 11:22.207
Pfft. Well, just save the drama

11:22.242 --> 11:23.942
for the phone call from your mama, okay?

11:23.977 --> 11:26.144
- We're gonna go for the plea deal.
- Okay.

11:26.179 --> 11:29.380
Come on, it's our only
chance to... wait, what?

11:29.416 --> 11:30.682
If you're not gonna defend me,

11:30.717 --> 11:32.083
we should just get this over with.

11:32.152 --> 11:33.885
Okay, great.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.020
Your Honor, my client, um...

11:36.056 --> 11:38.056
- Mm-hmm.
- My client would like to...

11:39.426 --> 11:41.559
- Yes?
- Sorry, just a moment.

11:41.595 --> 11:43.962
- So you're really innocent?
- Yes.

11:43.997 --> 11:46.197
But really, really innocent?

11:46.233 --> 11:48.299
Yes, that's what I've
been telling you. Yes.

11:48.335 --> 11:49.823
Crap. All right.

11:49.848 --> 11:52.982
Your Honor, my client would
like to say that he's innocent,

11:53.006 --> 11:56.040
and we're going to keep fighting
to prove it, as long as it takes.

11:56.076 --> 11:58.009
I thought you wanted
to get this over with.

11:58.044 --> 12:01.045
Yeah, I did, but everyone
deserves a fair trial.

12:01.081 --> 12:03.081
Even a broken down, chewed-up,

12:03.116 --> 12:06.050
spit-out guidance
counselor like Mr. Frond.

12:06.086 --> 12:08.119
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said about me.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.205
Objection! Gross!

12:12.010 --> 12:14.024
So how's the jury going Tina?

12:14.049 --> 12:15.516
We're not supposed to talk about it.

12:15.551 --> 12:17.062
But it's all Jimmy Junior and I can do.

12:17.086 --> 12:18.587
It's intense.

12:18.612 --> 12:20.879
We should've had this
thing wrapped up today,

12:20.914 --> 12:23.315
but I guess Louise
wants to lose tomorrow.

12:23.350 --> 12:25.083
Oh, I won't be losing, Gene.

12:25.118 --> 12:26.751
I just needed another day to figure out

12:26.787 --> 12:28.887
how to prove Mr. Frond is innocent.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.555
What? Don't you want to see him fry?

12:30.590 --> 12:31.856
I mean, I do.

12:31.892 --> 12:34.059
I did, I really did,

12:34.094 --> 12:36.261
but now I'm pretty sure he didn't do it.

12:36.296 --> 12:38.229
Pretty sure doesn't win trials, toots.

12:38.265 --> 12:40.198
Sounds like this trial
is gonna drag on forever.

12:40.233 --> 12:41.900
Darn it. Shucks.

12:41.935 --> 12:43.568
Look, I wish I had someone like me

12:43.603 --> 12:45.170
when I was falsely accused.

12:45.205 --> 12:47.172
I mean, today me, not yesterday me.

12:47.207 --> 12:48.707
Yesterday me was phoning it in.

12:48.742 --> 12:52.577
Aw, my baby's having
a crisis of conscience.

12:52.612 --> 12:54.746
You're doing something
nice for Mr. Frond.

12:54.781 --> 12:56.748
Ugh! Gross! I am not!

12:56.783 --> 12:58.750
- You like him.
- No, I don't!

12:58.785 --> 12:59.884
You like him.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.297
You know what? I'm
going to bed to think.

13:01.321 --> 13:02.765
I have to think. I
have to go think in bed.

13:02.789 --> 13:05.091
- You think about how you like him.
- No, I don't!

13:06.493 --> 13:09.361
Today the defense will
prove that Mr. Frond

13:09.396 --> 13:10.595
did not steal the yogurt.

13:10.630 --> 13:12.063
And what's more,

13:12.099 --> 13:14.566
I will show you who
did steal the yogurt.

13:14.601 --> 13:16.112
As soon as I figure out who that is.

13:16.136 --> 13:18.470
Oh, please, we all
know Mr. Frond did it.

13:18.505 --> 13:20.071
The yogurt was in his trash can.

13:20.107 --> 13:21.573
And no one likes him.

13:21.608 --> 13:22.807
I mean, right?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.075
Objection to the first part.

13:24.111 --> 13:25.477
That's hearsay, I think.

13:25.512 --> 13:26.745
It's all hearsay.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.079
You hear it, then you say it.

13:29.349 --> 13:30.582
Oh, that is good.

13:30.617 --> 13:31.816
I will allow it.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.084
Of course you'll allow it.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.486
What won't you allow?

13:34.521 --> 13:36.654
That kind of talk in
my courtroom, Missy.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.790
But in this case, I'll allow it.

13:38.825 --> 13:40.191
Wow, this judge sure is permissive.

13:40.227 --> 13:41.459
Ugh. God.

13:41.495 --> 13:44.507
Your Honor? Tina won't stop
talking to me about the case

13:44.531 --> 13:45.908
and we're not supposed
to do that, right?

13:45.932 --> 13:47.172
Well, technically you're right,

13:47.200 --> 13:48.678
but you're coming off a little whiny.

13:48.702 --> 13:50.235
Ugh. Great.

13:50.270 --> 13:52.270
You're back. Where were we?

13:52.305 --> 13:54.839
Anyway, look at the map.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.275
Mr. Frond's office is
between the teacher's lounge

13:57.310 --> 13:59.010
and the cafeteria.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.579
It would've been easy for
someone to eat that yogurt

14:01.615 --> 14:03.348
as they walked down the hall, finish it,

14:03.383 --> 14:05.850
and throw it in Mr. Frond's trash can.

14:05.886 --> 14:08.153
So the question is who would've been

14:08.188 --> 14:09.954
in the teacher's lounge after school,

14:09.990 --> 14:12.690
when teachers are rushing
out to their second jobs?

14:12.726 --> 14:15.794
Who would've gone from
there to the cafeteria?

14:15.829 --> 14:17.462
Oh, I don't know. Wait, yes I do.

14:17.497 --> 14:19.330
Oh, my God! He's right there!

14:19.366 --> 14:20.977
Yes, Mr. Frond was in
the teacher's lounge

14:21.001 --> 14:22.240
on Monday afternoon.

14:22.265 --> 14:25.003
But witnesses place
two other people there

14:25.038 --> 14:26.838
on that same afternoon.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.007
I call back to the stand Ms. Selbo.

14:29.946 --> 14:32.844
So, Ms. Selbo, you were
in the teacher's lounge

14:32.879 --> 14:35.213
just minutes before the
yogurt went missing, correct?

14:35.248 --> 14:37.916
Yes, I go there after school
and pretend I'm a teacher.

14:37.951 --> 14:39.484
I use Ms. Jacobson's mug.

14:39.519 --> 14:40.985
- What?
- I mean, I don't pretend anything

14:41.021 --> 14:42.220
and I use a paper cup.

14:42.255 --> 14:43.488
And I didn't take the yogurt.

14:43.523 --> 14:44.723
And why should we believe you?

14:44.758 --> 14:45.990
I'm lactose intolerant.

14:46.026 --> 14:47.559
- You are?
- Big time.

14:47.594 --> 14:49.205
Get me a gallon of
milk and I'll prove it.

14:49.229 --> 14:50.229
I will allow it.

14:50.263 --> 14:51.563
No, no, no, we're good.

14:51.598 --> 14:53.487
Thanks for letting us crash

14:53.512 --> 14:54.699
your birthday party to get revenge

14:54.734 --> 14:56.167
on a dirty food scammer.

14:56.203 --> 14:58.002
You only turn 86 once!

14:58.038 --> 14:59.659
Oh, God, is that him?

14:59.684 --> 15:01.705
- Get in the closet!
- Just me and Linda, or everybody?

15:01.730 --> 15:02.874
All of us, Teddy!

15:02.909 --> 15:04.209
Mom, we'll be in the closet.

15:04.244 --> 15:06.511
You ladies let him
in and enjoy the show.

15:08.014 --> 15:09.781
Ow. Ow!

15:09.816 --> 15:12.884
The defense calls to 
the stand Mr. Branca.

15:12.919 --> 15:15.153
Mr. Branca, please tell the
court what you were doing

15:15.188 --> 15:17.188
in the teacher's lounge
after school Monday.

15:17.224 --> 15:18.957
Same thing I do in there every day,

15:18.992 --> 15:21.259
empty the trash, pretend to vacuum.

15:21.294 --> 15:22.727
You know, Branca stuff.

15:22.762 --> 15:24.362
That carpet probably hides dirt.

15:24.397 --> 15:26.064
Yeah. I just make the sound.

15:27.637 --> 15:29.033
Is someone vacuuming?

15:29.069 --> 15:30.602
So what did you do next?

15:30.637 --> 15:32.570
Well, I walked down the hallway,

15:32.606 --> 15:35.106
mopped up something vomit-ish.

15:35.142 --> 15:37.008
Then what? Then what, Branca?

15:37.043 --> 15:38.576
Picked up some odds and ends,

15:38.612 --> 15:41.513
a broken scrunchie, a
few retainers, a spoon...

15:41.548 --> 15:43.781
What? Did you just say "a spoon"?

15:43.817 --> 15:47.134
- Yes. Am I saying that right? Spoon.
- Let me get this straight,

15:47.159 --> 15:50.455
you're confessing that you found
a spoon Monday after school?

15:50.490 --> 15:52.117
Where did you find it, Branca?

15:52.142 --> 15:53.458
In your mouth?

15:53.493 --> 15:55.059
I find spoons all over the place.

15:55.095 --> 15:56.928
Someone tried to flush
a spoon down the toilet

15:56.963 --> 15:59.230
- three times last year.
- My bad.

15:59.266 --> 16:01.266
You want me out there
finding your spoons.

16:01.301 --> 16:03.368
You need me out there
finding your spoons.

16:03.403 --> 16:05.874
I mean, who leaves a spoon
on a drinking fountain?

16:05.899 --> 16:07.472
Wait, where did you find the spoon?

16:07.507 --> 16:08.940
On the drinking fountain.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.276
Thank you. I believe you didn't do it.

16:11.311 --> 16:12.544
Oh, thank God.

16:12.579 --> 16:13.914
But I know who did.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.749
♪ Dun, dun, dun! ♪

16:17.710 --> 16:19.877
I have one last question
for you, Mr. Branca.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.131
The drinking fountain
you found the spoon on,

16:22.156 --> 16:25.139
- how would you describe it?
- The... squirty one?

16:25.164 --> 16:27.192
The squirty one.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.538
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen,

16:29.563 --> 16:31.618
we all started this trial thinking

16:31.643 --> 16:33.272
Mr. Frond was gross and terrible.

16:33.335 --> 16:34.668
And we still think that.

16:34.703 --> 16:35.935
He's many things:

16:35.971 --> 16:37.303
annoying, desperate.

16:37.339 --> 16:39.105
But he's also something else:

16:39.141 --> 16:40.178
innocent.

16:40.203 --> 16:43.076
Mr. Frond didn't eat
Mr. Ambrose's yogurt.

16:43.111 --> 16:44.344
Judge Conklin did.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.412
Whoa.

16:45.447 --> 16:46.579
- What?
- Oh, my God.

16:46.615 --> 16:48.648
- Oh, my goodness.
- Do what?

16:48.684 --> 16:49.858
Order! Order!

16:49.883 --> 16:52.619
That is a very serious
accusation, Louise.

16:52.654 --> 16:54.421
- Yeah!
- Don't you accuse my judge!

16:54.456 --> 16:55.655
Don't you do it!

16:55.691 --> 16:57.023
Present your argument.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.703
You know, I got suspicious
when you mentioned

16:58.727 --> 17:01.795
the carpet in the teacher's
lounge probably hides dirt.

17:01.830 --> 17:04.164
It made it sound like you'd
been in the teacher's lounge.

17:04.199 --> 17:05.799
But it was something else you said

17:05.840 --> 17:07.428
when you first walked in on Monday.

17:07.453 --> 17:11.281
You said you had an accident,
and it was water, not pee.

17:11.306 --> 17:12.972
It was pee!

17:13.008 --> 17:15.545
- No, Zeke. It was water.
- Oh.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.089
I say Judge Conklin

17:17.115 --> 17:18.545
went into the teacher's lounge

17:18.579 --> 17:20.396
and helped himself to the yogurt,

17:20.422 --> 17:22.349
ate it as he walked down the hall,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.684
threw away the container
in Mr. Frond's trash can,

17:24.720 --> 17:27.053
then went to the drinking
fountain to wash it down,

17:27.089 --> 17:28.688
leaving the spoon on top.

17:28.724 --> 17:30.690
The squirty fountain
did what it does best,

17:30.726 --> 17:33.159
squirted him, hence the wet sleeve.

17:33.195 --> 17:35.228
Wow. You are...

17:35.263 --> 17:36.863
100% correct.

17:39.267 --> 17:40.500
I looked up to you.

17:40.535 --> 17:42.969
What I don't know is why.

17:43.004 --> 17:46.306
Why did you eat a yogurt
that did not belong to you?

17:46.341 --> 17:47.474
Yeah, why?

17:47.509 --> 17:49.175
It was an honest mistake.

17:49.211 --> 17:51.010
Usually at these school mock trials

17:51.046 --> 17:52.645
they have some sort of refreshments.

17:52.681 --> 17:54.881
I thought the yogurt
was your attempt at that.

17:54.916 --> 17:58.184
I didn't know about this new
spoon-in-the-lid technology,

17:58.220 --> 18:00.720
so I just used one of those
old-fashioned metal spoons

18:00.756 --> 18:02.793
and I accidentally
left it on the fountain.

18:02.818 --> 18:05.091
But why didn't you just
admit you did it yesterday?

18:05.127 --> 18:06.860
Why make us go through all of this?

18:06.895 --> 18:09.462
I thought I saw potential in
this young defense attorney.

18:09.498 --> 18:12.398
When this case fell in our lap,
it seemed like a good challenge.

18:12.434 --> 18:15.435
So this whole time,
you were teaching us.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.771
And I have to say, I am impressed.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.272
I like the way you think.

18:19.307 --> 18:21.341
You dug deep to find the truth

18:21.376 --> 18:22.942
and saved an innocent man.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.845
Even though you two clearly have issues.

18:25.881 --> 18:26.846
We do. We do.

18:26.882 --> 18:28.181
Anyway, Mr. Ambrose?

18:28.216 --> 18:29.415
How much was that yogurt?

18:29.451 --> 18:32.185
$2.59, plus tax!

18:32.220 --> 18:33.953
I'll give you $3 and
we'll call it square.

18:33.989 --> 18:35.221
Court is adjourned!

18:35.257 --> 18:36.723
I guess I better put this on.

18:36.758 --> 18:37.957
I have a date later.

18:37.993 --> 18:40.059
- It'll be a great ice breaker.
- _

18:40.095 --> 18:42.796
Bye everyone! Hope
you all become lawyers!

18:42.831 --> 18:44.631
Kids, please don't tell your parents

18:44.666 --> 18:46.132
how we've spent the last two days.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.735
My wife.

18:48.770 --> 18:50.470
I, uh, I think he's about to wrap it up.

18:51.807 --> 18:53.473
You like? It's nice.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.808
Oh!

18:54.843 --> 18:56.743
This has to be the finale. Let's go.

18:56.778 --> 18:58.211
Let's go, let's go. Up, up.

19:00.982 --> 19:02.215
- Move it!
- Ow.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.950
Hi, there. Remember us?

19:03.985 --> 19:06.953
You said you found a hair
in my baloney cala-zoney?

19:06.988 --> 19:10.089
- And in a burger at Bob's Burgers?
- Hi, I'm Teddy.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.325
Oh, yeah. What's... going on?

19:12.360 --> 19:16.462
Well, we're really unsatisfied
with your performance today.

19:16.498 --> 19:19.933
It's almost like we found
a hair in your Borat.

19:19.968 --> 19:22.468
Yeah, we're gonna need this comped.

19:22.504 --> 19:24.137
All right, I see what you're doing here.

19:24.172 --> 19:26.105
Yeah, checkmate. Ha!

19:26.141 --> 19:27.974
You, uh, actually prepaid for the show

19:28.009 --> 19:30.009
when you put your credit
card in on the Web site.

19:30.045 --> 19:33.179
No cancellations or refunds
one hour prior to performance.

19:33.215 --> 19:34.981
Uh, what? I didn't, I didn't, uh...

19:35.016 --> 19:36.249
I didn't know that.

19:36.284 --> 19:38.618
Oh, way to go, Bob. Jeez.

19:38.653 --> 19:40.253
So I guess this isn't checkmate,

19:40.288 --> 19:42.622
more like check the user agreement.

19:42.657 --> 19:44.958
I've never seen a man
this naked be this smug.

19:44.993 --> 19:47.093
Thanks for everything
and see you guys around.

19:47.128 --> 19:48.461
Not so fast.

19:48.496 --> 19:49.863
Finish your performance.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.130
- What?
- You heard him.

19:51.166 --> 19:52.999
We paid for it, we want it all.

19:53.034 --> 19:54.767
We do? I saw enough personally.

19:54.803 --> 19:56.169
Fine.

19:56.204 --> 19:59.539
I like you, do you like me?

20:01.042 --> 20:03.329
He... he is actually really good.

20:04.980 --> 20:06.236
Louise,

20:06.261 --> 20:09.515
I've been a lawyer for
three long, sweltering days,

20:09.551 --> 20:11.184
and I know when I've been bested.

20:11.219 --> 20:12.719
Because you lost the case?

20:12.754 --> 20:14.654
Yes. That's when I knew.

20:14.689 --> 20:16.356
I'm just glad the jury came through

20:16.391 --> 20:18.825
and we were able to serve
up a hot slice of justice.

20:18.860 --> 20:20.560
I mean, we didn't, but we would have

20:20.595 --> 20:22.495
if we'd been able to
deliberate or do anything.

20:22.530 --> 20:25.231
Louise, I want to say thank you.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.966
Honestly, I was
terrified the whole time,

20:27.002 --> 20:29.168
but, you did the right
thing. And helped me.

20:29.204 --> 20:31.137
I know. It was very big of me.

20:31.172 --> 20:33.840
Right. If you'll excuse
me, now that I'm a free man,

20:33.875 --> 20:37.043
I have a reservation for one
at the supermarket salad bar.

20:37.078 --> 20:38.411
Ugh. So sad.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.046
Yep. But thank you again.

20:40.115 --> 20:41.915
- I'm proud of you.
- Yuck.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.384
Well, it's how I feel, so there you go.

20:44.419 --> 20:46.319
Sorry I didn't believe
you in the first place.

20:46.354 --> 20:47.854
- What?
- Nothing!
