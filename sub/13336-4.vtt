WEBVTT

00:07.360 --> 00:08.520
We're back!

00:10.560 --> 00:11.960
Let's fucking do this!

00:14.600 --> 00:15.760
Come on!

00:16.960 --> 00:18.040
More pulling.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.040
More getting mortal!

00:21.680 --> 00:22.720
More fights...

00:27.160 --> 00:28.920
Things are about to go crazy.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.560
Let the chaos begin.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.040
I'm so tight.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.840
All I wanna do is get freaky
with Scott.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.040
Stop being so fucking perfect.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.560
Do I fancy him?

00:40.640 --> 00:41.640
I don't even know.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.360
What's different this time?

00:44.520 --> 00:49.160
This is the one and only time
me heart has been broken by Gary.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.560
I'm actually gonna have to
bring her into this mad house.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.160
I fucking love you, right?!

00:59.240 --> 01:01.400
Dead fucking silence.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.640
I think me and Holly
have both realised

01:04.720 --> 01:08.320
that we've got to work a lot harder
if we want this to work.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.160
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.720
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six pack.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.760
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.280
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.480
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.640
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.400
I'm preened to perfection.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.560
I'm colourful and full of mischief.

01:27.640 --> 01:29.400
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.840
I'll make sparks fly
and get everyone feisty.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.840
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:49.200 --> 01:51.760
No, no, no, no!

01:51.840 --> 01:55.200
Last night, I told Kyle
that I loved him. Fuck!

01:55.280 --> 01:57.640
I don't know why I'd say that.
I don't mean it.

01:59.920 --> 02:00.920
Well, I was drunk.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.040
Do drunk people not say these
stupid things sometimes?

02:04.120 --> 02:06.080
No, drunk people say the truth.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.440
Nah, I don't.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.760
Holly's telling us that she
didn't mean what she said to Kyle,

02:10.840 --> 02:13.080
but we all know it's cos
she's embarrassed.

02:13.160 --> 02:16.480
It was a horrible moment.
"I love you, man."

02:16.560 --> 02:18.960
And it was just silence.
This is so awkward.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.760
I can't believe that
when I have actually said it,

02:21.840 --> 02:24.640
I've wore my heart on my sleeve,
and he just went...

02:25.760 --> 02:30.560
I need to know how he feels.
I need to know exactly how he feels.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.160
Before I can take this any further
because right now,

02:34.240 --> 02:36.760
it doesn't seem like
he wants to be involved.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.760
I think that Kyle's gotten in
too deep with Holly,

02:39.840 --> 02:41.280
and now he's in panic mode

02:41.360 --> 02:44.880
cos he's not sure whether he really
wants to take it any further.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.840
(sighs)

02:50.120 --> 02:52.520
What the fuck happened
with Scott and Chloe?

02:54.920 --> 02:57.360
Scott didn't spend the night
in the boys' room.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.200
He probably had a sleepover
in Chloe's vagina.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.840
I kissed Scott.
What?

03:01.920 --> 03:02.920
Yeah.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.560
Was it passionate?

03:08.680 --> 03:09.680
Like a sucker fish.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.280
Scott only went and got dibs
on both the newbies.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.800
Not only pulling Chloe,
he's even necked on with Nathan.

03:17.880 --> 03:21.400
Scott's fucking getting right
amongst the newbies.(laughter)

03:28.240 --> 03:30.680
No, man. I can't believe
I've had sex with you.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.480
I've woke up this morning
to the sound of moaning.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.920
And not even the good kind,
it's Chloe whingeing. Soz, kid.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.000
No, you wanted it.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.680
(laughs)

03:44.760 --> 03:48.520
It has been a while since I got
freaky. Scott has sorted us out.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.320
We may as well make it
a regular thing.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.400
I think, right, we should just,
when we get in,

03:54.480 --> 03:56.880
every time we're drunk...
just have it.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.000
How come every time I have sex with
a girl, she just wants to marry us?

04:01.080 --> 04:02.840
Me cock is fucking cursed.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.040
Yeah.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.760
Yeah, definitely.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.840
I don't know what else to do
any more.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.320
I don't know what Kyle wants and
I know that I wanna be with him.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.280
But does he feel the same?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.320
All I wanna do today
is sort everything out

04:31.400 --> 04:33.640
and let each other know
where we both stand.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.320
I do really care about you.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.360
But what I said in the taxi

04:37.440 --> 04:40.880
was probably one of the most
awkward moments of me entire life.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.400
For you to just, like, not even
give us a cuddle when I'm so upset

04:44.480 --> 04:45.960
was just... it hurts.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.760
Maybe I should give her a cuddle.

04:49.840 --> 04:53.120
I've never been in that position.
It caught me off guard.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.240
I've never said them words
to a woman.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.760
I've never said that,
and I just feel like...

04:59.840 --> 05:02.040
...if you mean that,
you should mean it,

05:02.120 --> 05:04.960
rather than just come out with it.
I was drunk, Kyle.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.760
Yeah.
And maybe I did mean it...

05:08.120 --> 05:09.480
(sighs)

05:09.560 --> 05:11.200
I am terrified of Kyle

05:11.280 --> 05:14.120
finding out how strong
my feelings are towards him.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.720
He'll probably run away.

05:15.800 --> 05:19.520
I'm literally terrified that
we're not gonna get through this.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.560
It really, really scares us.

05:21.640 --> 05:26.640
Because... I haven't felt like this
in a long time.

05:26.720 --> 05:29.360
I don't want you to say
"I love you" or anything,

05:29.440 --> 05:31.680
I just wanna know that you care.
I do care.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.040
I really do care.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.120
Holly means more to me
than anyone in that house.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.600
If I ever lost her,
I don't know what I'd do.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.960
Hopefully, we can carry on now
without any arguments.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.920
Yeah.
(laughs)

06:04.000 --> 06:07.600
Last night, Gaz told me and Aaron
he's been seeing a bird outside.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.760
To be fair,
I'm proper happy for the kid.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.120
Now everyone knows about Lillie,
I want them to meet her.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.000
But obviously I've got
people's feelings to think about.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.760
I'm buzzing to meet Lillie.
She must be something special.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.640
Gaz doesn't look at other girls.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.520
I never thought I'd see the day.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.480
This is the first time I'm
introducing a girl to this house.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.520
I never thought this day would come.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.080
I'm gonna call Lillie
and invite her out tomorrow night

07:08.160 --> 07:11.480
to meet everybody. I honestly
can't believe I'm saying that.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.600
Fuck it, it's time.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.120
Hello, babe. You all right?

07:18.160 --> 07:19.240
You missing us?

07:19.720 --> 07:22.040
Normally when I'm in here,
I miss nothing.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.720
But just ringing Lillie
and hearing her voice is amazing.

07:31.160 --> 07:35.080
If you can come up, I was gonna maybe
go for a meal or something first,

07:35.160 --> 07:36.800
so obviously I'd get to see ya.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.040
Then after that, just go to the club
and meet everyone else.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.480
Should be fun.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.720
OK, bye.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.720
I'm buzzing for everyone to
meet Lillie tomorrow,

07:54.800 --> 07:58.120
but I couldn't be more nervous.
What worries me is Charlotte.

07:58.200 --> 08:00.400
Me and Charlotte have
been through a lot.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.880
I'm just panicking that when she
actually sees Lillie with me,

08:03.960 --> 08:06.120
she might kick off.
She's unpredictable.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.240
Me and the girls are getting ready,

08:16.320 --> 08:18.360
and Chloe is spilling the beans

08:18.440 --> 08:20.480
after Scott spilled his beans
in her.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.440
What was his willy like?
Well, it's a bit curved.

08:23.520 --> 08:25.440
Like, do you know...
Like a banana?

08:25.520 --> 08:28.560
Like a spine.
It's curved like a hunchback.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.080
I was pretty drunk,

08:30.160 --> 08:33.760
but I'm sure it's curved on the
bell-end ten degrees to the right.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.960
I don't think I wanna drink tonight.
I'm gonna try and not drink.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.400
Oh, haway, man!

08:39.480 --> 08:43.240
Well, that's boring. (laughs)
Why don't you just stay in? Freak.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.960
Me and Aaron were flirting
last night.I'll keep you away.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.360
Me and Aaron have been getting
way too close.

08:49.440 --> 08:52.200
When I'm drunk, I get flirty.
I can't risk losing Dan.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.640
What about we all just make
the noise that a hen makes

08:57.720 --> 09:01.600
when it wakes you up?
Cuckoo! Cukoo! Cuckoo!

09:01.680 --> 09:06.000
Me and the girls have got the
most amazing plan to warn Marnie

09:06.080 --> 09:08.200
when she's getting
too close to Aaron.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.520
It's genius. She'll never miss it,
she's always gonna see it

09:11.600 --> 09:13.280
and she's always gonna hear it.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.520
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
(laughter)

09:18.600 --> 09:21.200
Girls on tour, bitches! Kill it.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.480
Cheers everyone!

09:23.560 --> 09:25.720
Everyone is ready
and off to Tup Tup.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.680
It's gonna be a wicked night. Kaw!

09:32.520 --> 09:34.640
I'm pure buzzing
with Tup Tup tonight.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.880
I'll be going wild in the aisles
like fucking Dale Winton.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.640
First things first.
Drinks, shots, dancing. Boom.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.960
Me and Marnie flirting is harmless.
She's got a boyfriend.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.440
Even when I stay away from Aaron,

10:09.520 --> 10:12.080
he goes out of his way to
only show interest in me.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.520
I don't know why he's
making it harder for us.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.120
Why doesn't he go and pull?

10:17.080 --> 10:19.080
Aaron and Marnie are getting close.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.360
This means we need to do the
warning sign. Buccaw! Buccaw!

10:25.800 --> 10:28.760
The girls start making
the warning sound.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.480
He doesn't have a clue.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.840
(squawking)
All I can hear is bird noises.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.880
Are we in Tup Tup,
or the fucking zoo?

10:45.280 --> 10:48.320
I'm buzzing for everyone to
meet Lillie tomorrow night.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.240
I need to tell Charlotte first.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.160
She's the one I care about most
and the person it'll affect the most.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.040
Well, I was having a good night
until Gary started chatting to us

11:07.120 --> 11:11.160
about his new girlfriend.
What a fucking buzz-kill.

11:17.960 --> 11:21.760
I can wait to meet Lillie.
I can wait forever.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.280
I can wait until I'm dead.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.200
You see this? You know what this is?

11:31.280 --> 11:32.840
It's a brave face, Gary.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.240
And I am putting this on
especially for you.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.680
Charlotte says she's OK about Lillie.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.000
Charlotte and Lillie actually meeting
is a whole new ballgame.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.600
I hope Charlotte isn't putting on
a brave face and it goes smoothly.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.840
Of course I'm not happy for you,
Gary.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.360
And no,
I don't want you to bring Lillie in.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.800
But can I say that? No.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.200
Because I'll look like
a jealous, bitter bitch.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.360
But that's exactly what I am!
Die, Lillie, die!

12:20.920 --> 12:23.000
This is the best night by far.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.240
I'm really starting to feel
like part of the family.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.760
Nathan's absolutely off his head.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.440
He can't stand up.
It's nice to have some company.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.640
I'm having such a good night,
but I think I've drank too much.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.080
I'm absolutely mortal.
Time to get back to the house.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.600
We're back at the house
and everyone's shit-faced.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.720
The party's just getting started.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.160
(laughs)

13:07.480 --> 13:09.320
All I wanna do
is get in the hot tub,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.960
but I can't even get
my bloody clothes off.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.680
It looks like it's bed for me.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.920
No one else wants to
come in the hot tub,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.640
they're all boring fuckers.
It's just me and Chloe. Bring it on!

13:27.840 --> 13:29.480
Me and Chloe are very similar.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.680
So I've decided to take her
under me wing, look after her.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.960
OK, I must have had
way too much to drink now.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.120
I'm confessing I fancy Charlotte.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.400
Right, I know I wanted to
take Chloe under me wing,

13:53.480 --> 13:55.200
but this has gone too far.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.920
Any minute now,
I'm probably gonna feel fingers

13:58.000 --> 14:01.120
touching me vagina flaps.
Get me out of here.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.440
I'm mortal
and so much has happened tonight,

14:10.520 --> 14:13.160
I can't even keep up.
So I'm going to bed.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.520
I know I've got a bird now,
but when Charlotte is smashed,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
I'm still gonna help her to bed.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.400
Me and Kyle are snuggled up in our
little den that we've created,

14:33.480 --> 14:36.520
and I'm just so happy that
we haven't argued tonight.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.120
(moaning)

14:38.200 --> 14:40.880
Charlotte's already
fallen asleep in my bed.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.920
So I'm going to have a little
sleepover with the boys.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.280
Night, everyone.
Night-night.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.280
What?

14:59.320 --> 15:01.960
Really? How do you feel about that?

15:02.040 --> 15:05.280
I feel like... Fuck.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.800
I'm starting to get nervous
cos it's getting closer to the time

15:08.880 --> 15:10.400
where I need to meet Lillie.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.120
I'd never normally meet
an ex's girlfriend,

15:13.200 --> 15:17.000
but because I'm living in this house
with Gary, I've got to. I hate it.

15:17.080 --> 15:19.320
You just have to look
extra nice tonight.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.600
Hair, tan...
What do you think I should do?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.560
Sexy is out.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.080
The only way to match perfect Lillie

15:29.160 --> 15:31.720
is if I'm actually
more perfect meself.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.440
Maybe at the end of the night,
Lillie'll be like,

15:34.520 --> 15:38.240
"Charlotte's so much perfect
than me. And I'll be like, "Ha!"

15:38.320 --> 15:41.080
Fuck, she's gonna look so ugly
compared to me.

15:41.160 --> 15:42.920
(laughs)
Stupid bitch.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.840
The big night tonight,
ain't it, kid?

15:49.680 --> 15:51.480
It is mental.
It's a big thing.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.400
Lillie's coming out tonight
and she's gonna meet everyone.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.240
I don't know what's gonna happen.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.680
Have you spoken to Charlotte
about Lillie?

16:10.440 --> 16:12.440
If Charlotte's sober, she's fine.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.280
If she has a drink
and Psycho Charlotte comes out,

16:15.360 --> 16:18.760
that's what I'm worried about.
I've met that girl a few times,

16:18.840 --> 16:20.760
and I do not want Lillie to meet her.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.880
We're going out,
we're gonna get a massage.

16:31.960 --> 16:33.200
Are you?
Mm-hmm.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.760
Relieve some stress before tonight.

16:35.840 --> 16:39.440
Charlotte is so nervous and she
needs someone to talk to about it.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.400
I'm gonna take her for a massage.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.120
Enjoy your massage.
Thanks.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.240
See youse later.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.320
I am expecting her to walk in

16:55.400 --> 16:59.400
and have fireworks shooting out of
her arsehole. Yeah.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.520
It's all becoming really real.
In a matter of hours,

17:02.600 --> 17:05.080
I'll be face to face
with Gary's girlfriend.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.720
And it terrifies us.

17:14.640 --> 17:15.640
Yeah.

17:15.720 --> 17:19.520
If I was Charlotte right now, I
would be absolutely shitting myself.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.840
But we're all here for her and we
won't let anything bad happen.

17:32.000 --> 17:35.560
I feel like there's always gonna be
that something between us

17:35.640 --> 17:37.920
because of all our history.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.440
The thing is, Gary always said he
was never ready to settle down.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.840
But now he is ready
and it isn't with me.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.960
That's the biggest
kick in the teeth.

17:46.040 --> 17:50.520
The road you need to take tonight
is to try and not get too pissed.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.640
Wh... Do I have to do a toast?

18:03.680 --> 18:04.680
(laughs)

18:04.760 --> 18:08.080
I feel sick. I can't do this,
I won't do it.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.760
I've got to do it.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.880
It's gonna be fine.

18:12.240 --> 18:14.280
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.800
God's sake.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.160
Tonight's massive for me.
I'm taking Lillie for a date

18:26.240 --> 18:29.440
then she's meeting everyone.
It's the calm before the storm.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.800
I... I'm actually, nervous.
I've actually got butterflies.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.480
Gaz looks like he's just shit
himself a brand-new arsehole.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.000
I've never, ever seen the kid
so nervous about a night out.

18:52.920 --> 18:55.640
We're back from the massage,
and as we walk in,

18:55.720 --> 18:57.720
Gary is literally walking out.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.720
And I know it's because he's
going to meet Lillie. Shit.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.440
See ya.
See ya soon.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.920
Bye.
Enjoy. See youse in a bit.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.600
That's the thing with the
Geordie Shore house,

19:07.680 --> 19:11.080
I'm leaving to go on a date with
my new bird, and on the way out,

19:11.160 --> 19:14.040
I bump into my ex bird.
Not awkward at all.

19:17.560 --> 19:20.680
I'm really nervous for tonight.
I wanna run away and hide

19:20.760 --> 19:22.000
and not even go out.

19:22.080 --> 19:25.480
I need to speak to my mam
because she knows everything.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
Hi, Mam.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.480
I just need to tell you some stuff.
I need some advice.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.320
Gary told us that he's got,
erm, he's met someone.

19:37.320 --> 19:38.960
What?

19:42.480 --> 19:45.000
I thought me mam would
give us the best advice,

19:45.080 --> 19:47.160
but I shouldn't have bothered.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.120
Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.680
That advice was all right,
I suppose.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.960
All right, well... I love you, then.

20:01.040 --> 20:04.520
It was nice talking to me mam
and she made us feel a bit better,

20:04.600 --> 20:07.040
but it hasn't changed the fact
that tonight,

20:07.120 --> 20:09.840
I've gotta come
face to face with Lillie.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.680
I should be so excited to see Lillie,
and I am,

20:21.760 --> 20:24.960
but at the minute,
nerves are overriding the excitement.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.280
Hello.
(laughs)

20:28.360 --> 20:29.440
Hello.

20:30.640 --> 20:33.920
I honestly can't over to
give her a cuddle quick enough.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.360
I realise how much I've missed her.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.520
This is nice.
(laughs)

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
You OK?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.120
(laughs) That's very cute.
What?

20:44.200 --> 20:45.200
That's very cute.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.840
You look gorgeous.
Thank you.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.760
I've always been the person who used
to take the piss out of all my mates

20:50.840 --> 20:52.960
who've got girlfriends
or go on dates,

20:53.040 --> 20:55.240
and now I've just
shot myself in the foot.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.600
I've been missing you so much, man.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.360
It's cute.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.440
Yeah.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.840
Yeah, it's a good thing.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.840
I know I've changed around Lillie.

21:11.920 --> 21:14.720
She brings a side out in me
I didn't even know I have.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.920
I'm getting butterflies on a date
with a girl I'm seeing.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.680
What's going on?

21:26.400 --> 21:30.480
As soon as Kyle's finished
caking his face in bronzer,

21:30.560 --> 21:32.360
we're off to meet Gaz's new bird.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.920
I hope nothing kicks off
with the girls.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.800
Nah, it won't.
Charlotte's happy to see him happy.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.080
It's gonna be hard for her though,
isn't it?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.320
Yeah, definitely.

21:41.400 --> 21:44.720
Best case scenario for Charlotte
is that this girl turns up,

21:44.800 --> 21:47.480
no hair, warts all over her face
and ugly as fuck.

21:47.560 --> 21:49.640
But she's probably a worldie.

21:53.120 --> 21:56.680
Me and the girls are getting ready.

21:56.760 --> 22:01.680
But this is getting ready for the
most nerve-racking night of me life.

22:01.760 --> 22:03.560
what does someone wear for that?

22:03.640 --> 22:06.720
I've got the little black playsuit,
right? Yeah.

22:06.800 --> 22:09.600
Which I thought I could wear
with me leather boots.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.960
You need to get the legs out.
They need to be on show.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
Shit.

22:17.200 --> 22:20.040
Charlotte is going about this
the right way tonight.

22:20.120 --> 22:21.960
She's got the dress, the attitude.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.080
All she need to do is not
accidentally swill Lillie.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.760
I can't wear this
cos it's gonna get too dirty.

22:30.840 --> 22:34.680
You are so anxious, aren't you?
I'm anxious. I'm getting anxiety.

22:34.760 --> 22:37.080
Right, OK,
so I'm gonna change again.

22:37.160 --> 22:42.160
There's only one thing a girl can
rely on in a situation like this,

22:42.240 --> 22:45.240
and that is a little black dress.

22:45.320 --> 22:46.920
Come to mama.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.080
I like that one, you look tiny.
Yes, love it.Yep.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.400
Simple, classy, sexy.
Short.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.080
But you can see nipple.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.320
Doesn't matter.
I'll always have me hair there.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.560
If you were the new girlfriend...

23:00.640 --> 23:02.080
Would I think you were fit?

23:04.960 --> 23:06.760
Without a doubt. I would as well.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.000
This is the one.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.080
I'm feeling amazing
in me little black dress.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.720
And maybe tonight
when I walk in that club,

23:13.800 --> 23:17.040
Gary's gonna be like,
"Wow, Charlotte looks amazing."

23:17.120 --> 23:20.000
"Goodbye, Lillie! Hello, Charlotte!"

23:22.800 --> 23:26.640
Calm, collective and cool.
Yep.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.840
Them are three things
that I always am,

23:28.920 --> 23:30.800
so it's gonna be easy. Yeah.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.120
Here's cheers to a drama-free night.
(all cheer)

23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
Good girl.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.120
We have a massive toast
to having a good night.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.320
Are these lot actually serious?

23:46.400 --> 23:48.600
Do they not know
what I'm going through?

23:48.680 --> 23:50.920
Can they not see
what a nervous wreck I am?

23:56.680 --> 23:59.240
We get to House of Smith
and we get the drinks in.

23:59.320 --> 24:03.600
But what everyone's really waiting
for is Gaz and Lillie to arrive.

24:05.680 --> 24:09.280
Charlotte needs to realise her
Geordie family are there for her,

24:09.360 --> 24:11.040
and that's all that matters.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.960
The first thing I wanna do
is practice how to meet Lillie.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.440
I need to get this
absolutely perfect.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.960
I'm acting awkward with Kyle. God
knows what'll happen with Lillie.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.120
Hello, Lillie!

24:32.200 --> 24:35.040
I still cannot believe
tonight is the night

24:35.120 --> 24:38.920
we are gonna meet Gary Beadle's
girlfriend. What the fuck?

24:50.120 --> 24:53.240
Don't be nervous.
I will not leave your side.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.840
And I'll make, I'll MAKE sure
you're OK. Promise.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.080
Lillie knows what these people
mean to me.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.200
And obviously she wants to meet them.

25:00.280 --> 25:04.640
But she's scared. I'm reassuring
her that everyone wants to meet her.

25:04.720 --> 25:07.240
I hope Charlotte doesn't
feel uncomfortable.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.000
I want her to feel comfortable.

25:11.560 --> 25:15.240
I respect that you've got a past
and that you're friends and, like...

25:15.320 --> 25:17.560
I hope that you can
continue to be friends

25:17.640 --> 25:21.080
and that she's comfortable,
eventually, with us both.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.160
Lillie, is so different.
She cares about me so much.

25:24.240 --> 25:28.040
She understands I wanna be friends
with Charlotte. That's amazing.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.280
Good night.
Yeah.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.880
That's the date done.
Now it's time to hit the club.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.680
We're all at House of Smith
having a drink,

25:41.760 --> 25:45.240
but what we're really all waiting for
is the minute Lillie walks in.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.120
Everyone's excited,
apart from Charlotte.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.680
She looks like she's trying to cut
the end off a cigar with her arse.

25:59.880 --> 26:02.200
I'm shaking it all out,
shaking it all out,

26:02.280 --> 26:04.560
shaking out the Lillie vibes.
I can do this.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.440
Walking in the club,
and I actually feel sick.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.560
I've never had nerves like this
before in my life.

26:23.120 --> 26:26.600
This is it. She's coming in.
Everyone's turned their heads.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.960
I'm not turning mine. No, I'm not.
Not yet, anyway.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.280
Oh, no, I've turned it.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.960
Fuck, this is it, the minute
that Charlotte has been dreading.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.040
Gary has just walked in with Lillie.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.920
Lillie arrives,
she looks absolutely beautiful.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
Gaz, has she got any fit mates?

26:48.080 --> 26:49.720
Hello! You look very nice.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.400
Oh, my God.
She's absolutely gorgeous.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.960
Charlotte must be gutted.

26:57.560 --> 27:01.240
I wanted her to be so ugly,
but she's not. She's gorgeous,

27:01.320 --> 27:02.640
just like a flower.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.320
Like a fucking lily!

27:08.360 --> 27:11.280
Shit, she's about to meet me.
What the fuck do I do?

27:14.120 --> 27:15.360
Charlotte walks over,

27:15.440 --> 27:18.240
it's like watching someone walk
across a minefield.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.440
I need to be ready,
in case this explodes.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.360
That went so fast, it was a blur.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.400
When I can't remember something,

27:33.480 --> 27:36.920
it means I've either pissed on
something or someone. Shit.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.440
I hope I didn't piss on her.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.160
Stage one, complete.

27:50.240 --> 27:53.920
(sighs) That could not have gone
any better.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.920
Me and Marnie can't help ourselves.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.360
We do flirt and the reason is
because we've got so much history

28:12.440 --> 28:14.680
and we just get on really well.

28:15.880 --> 28:19.800
Sometimes I feel like I might be
getting some feelings back for Aaron.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.520
It's because he's been
treating us and acting

28:22.600 --> 28:24.880
the way I always wanted him to.

28:35.040 --> 28:37.360
I know Charlotte's
keeping her distance.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.920
I don't expect her to
come over with open arms.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.520
I'm just proud of her
for keeping it together.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.960
I've been out pure loads with Gaz,
and I've never seen him like this.

28:59.040 --> 29:01.880
He looks like the Andrex puppy
after it sees bog roll.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.000
Step one was greeting Lillie.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.400
Step two is meeting Lillie.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.240
Fuck. I've gotta do this.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.040
I'm sitting with Lillie
and Charlotte walks over.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.160
She wants to talk to Lillie.
Oh, shit.

29:37.600 --> 29:41.200
I've gotta put my faith in humanity
and just walk off and leave them.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.240
How can she be nervous?
She is Gary's girlfriend.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.960
I have got to meet her, knowing
that I was never good enough.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.960
Everybody's eyes are on
Charlotte and Lillie.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.760
I'm so relieved neither of them

30:03.840 --> 30:06.080
are throwing drinks
in each other's faces.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.960
It's a night for the history books.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
I can't help but be annoyed.

30:17.880 --> 30:21.000
She's talking about what
Gary's told her about our past

30:21.080 --> 30:23.600
and just keeps on using
the word "friend".

30:23.680 --> 30:25.240
"You're such good friends."

30:25.320 --> 30:27.840
"I don't wanna get in the way of
your friendship."

30:27.920 --> 30:30.400
The same bullshit
he told me every night

30:30.480 --> 30:32.480
when he was trying to
get us into bed!

30:45.680 --> 30:49.280
The more I'm talking to Lillie,
the more I'm starting to like her,

30:49.360 --> 30:52.520
the more I'm starting to hate Gary.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.400
I know how hard that would've been
for Charlotte.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.640
She made an effort
and held it all together.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.760
That means everything to me.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.720
I'm glad that's out of the way
and done with.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.120
Now we can all dance
and enjoy the night.

31:13.200 --> 31:16.600
And I can finally get drunk
with me new pal Lillie. Yippee!

31:24.600 --> 31:27.120
I'm just buzzing now
that everyone's relaxed

31:27.200 --> 31:30.120
and Lillie can now see
the bunch of nutters I live with

31:30.200 --> 31:32.440
and realise why I love them so much.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.960
Kyle is being so good tonight.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.640
We promised not to argue
for Charlotte's sake.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.760
I'm just so glad that
Charlotte's misery and pain

31:47.840 --> 31:50.320
has brought me and Kyle
closer together.

32:10.120 --> 32:13.280
I love every single person for
what they were like tonight.

32:13.360 --> 32:16.040
I'm so proud that there's been
a drama-free night,

32:16.120 --> 32:17.480
and it's all for Lillie.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.040
Tonight had disaster
written all over it,

32:21.120 --> 32:24.240
but it couldn't have gone
any better. I am so relieved.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.320
Let's get back to the house.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.080
I'm on cloud nine.
I've had the best night ever,

32:30.160 --> 32:32.000
and it couldn't have went better.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.080
But now it's time to
send Lillie home

32:34.160 --> 32:38.440
cos there's no way she's ready for
a night in the Geordie Shore house.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.640
Charlotte's done so well.
She's held it together

32:43.720 --> 32:48.360
more than I ever thought she could.
I never knew she was this strong.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.800
You did so well.
And I know you're sad, I know.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.160
I've put on a brave face
for everyone to see,

32:58.240 --> 33:01.240
but now, it's all just come
crashing down on us.

33:01.320 --> 33:04.400
I really like her.
I know, she's a nice person.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.320
But that's a good thing.

33:10.440 --> 33:11.760
I know.

33:11.840 --> 33:16.720
I've never felt so shattered and...
just in bits about it.

33:16.800 --> 33:20.120
It's hard, I know. She's really nice
and pretty and lovely.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.400
And when I spoke to her,
she was so nice.

33:22.480 --> 33:26.280
I know.
And that makes it even worse.

33:26.360 --> 33:30.680
It's so awful to see Charlotte
break down in front of us.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.920
Especially when it's over Gary,
who isn't worth her tears.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.360
This has went on for four years.
I know.

33:36.440 --> 33:42.400
It's not like... I can't ignore him.
I can't not be with him.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.600
I can't not look at
anything he's doing

33:44.680 --> 33:46.800
because I have to live with him.
I know.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.760
It must be so difficult for
Charlotte to see somebody

33:49.840 --> 33:52.440
who's Gary's girlfriend
and makes him so happy.

33:52.520 --> 33:56.120
Some things don't work because
other things are meant to happen.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.800
When? Cos it's been four years.
I know it has.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.800
It's been four years.
I know, I know.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.480
And when is this good thing
gonna happen?

34:04.560 --> 34:08.280
Because it hasn't fucking happened.
Right now, you won't see it.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.760
Sometimes two people
aren't meant to work.

34:10.840 --> 34:14.120
And to be honest, Charlotte,
I love you and Gary together,

34:14.200 --> 34:16.120
but I always wanted better for you.

34:16.200 --> 34:19.320
And one day, you will fucking
find better than that.

34:22.920 --> 34:26.280
I gave everything up for Gary.
I would have give him anything.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.760
But all he's done is throw this
back into me face.

34:46.160 --> 34:47.440
I need a wee.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.520
We've got back to the house
and I'm absolutely mortal.

34:50.600 --> 34:52.800
Not only that,
I'm pretty upset as well.

34:52.880 --> 34:56.600
Holly, I'm stuck!
I don't know what's happened.

34:58.880 --> 35:01.440
I'm back at the house
and I'm fucking hyper,

35:01.520 --> 35:03.640
but I can hardly stand up.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.640
I've had a pure wicked night tonight
and everyone's mortal,

35:10.720 --> 35:12.800
but now Scotty T's off to kip.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.920
I'm so horny. I'm gonna
jump on Scott and see what happens.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.040
The problem is, when I've had
a drink, me head says no,

35:26.120 --> 35:29.320
but me fanny says go.
Why is Scott not interested tonight?

35:30.160 --> 35:31.440
Chloe's stuck to me leg

35:31.520 --> 35:34.760
like I've just stood on a
relationship-shaped mouse trap.

35:34.840 --> 35:38.640
Sorry, babe, but there's fucking
nae cheese for you tonight.

35:43.640 --> 35:47.640
I just wanna sit Charlotte down and
say thank you for being so amazing.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.400
Gary comes over and wants to
thank us for not going psycho.

36:02.480 --> 36:06.120
But Gary, if you were me real friend
and you actually knew us at all,

36:06.200 --> 36:08.760
you'd know I would never have
behaved like that.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.360
I'm not gonna lie to you, I'm not
gonna sit here and be nice to you,

36:12.440 --> 36:14.880
play like everything's fine,
it's not fine.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.520
It's not.
You have fucked my life up so bad.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.400
Like, so bad.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.680
And the fact that I have to sit here

36:23.760 --> 36:27.400
and then play happy families
with your new girlfriend

36:27.480 --> 36:28.640
just fucks us off.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.200
That's it.
I've held this in for so long.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.440
I'm not holding in a minute longer.

36:33.520 --> 36:35.880
I'm gonna tell Gary
exactly how I feel

36:35.960 --> 36:37.360
and exactly what I think.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.640
To me, Gary,
this is all a head-fuck.

36:46.880 --> 36:48.280
No.
It fucking was.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.760
Charlotte has just went off on one.
I knew it was too good to be true

36:56.040 --> 36:58.720
I've done this
in the nicest possible way.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.320
I just wanna be her friend.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.760
What, in this situation,
have I done wrong?

37:06.560 --> 37:10.480
Charlotte's kicked off with Gary.
But this has been brewing all night.

37:10.560 --> 37:13.320
She's been too quiet
and under too much pressure.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.200
You...
Why are you doing this? Why?

37:20.280 --> 37:23.200
You said... From day one,
you have not cared about me.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.240
So why...
When have I said that?

37:25.320 --> 37:27.520
When? When?! When, man?!

37:29.080 --> 37:30.600
Who hasn't?
Never!

37:30.680 --> 37:33.120
I have never, ever seen Charlotte
like this.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.680
She is unloading four years of
stress and heartache all over Gary.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.760
Don't fucking act like you
care about us when you don't!

37:39.840 --> 37:42.960
I'm so angry. I want to kill Gary.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.240
Why are you doing this now? Why?

37:45.320 --> 37:46.520
I'm so sorry, Gary.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.520
I wanna be fucking friends with you,
man!

37:52.400 --> 37:55.360
I don't know what's happened
or how this started,

37:55.440 --> 37:57.880
but Charlotte is proper
in Gaz's face, like.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.800
She might as well be exfoliating it.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.120
Charlotte, man...
You don't care! Whoa!

38:02.200 --> 38:04.200
Shut up!

38:10.200 --> 38:13.200
Especially not fucking you.
You can fucking do one.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.400
Cos that is the last time
I'm trying to help you out.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.920
I can't watch this any longer.
I need to be there for Charlotte.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.240
I need to make sure
my best friend is OK.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.320
(sobs)

38:30.600 --> 38:34.440
After a mint night, how has it
come to this? I'm off to bed.

38:34.520 --> 38:38.520
There's me minding my own business,
going to bed like a good girl,

38:38.600 --> 38:41.880
and then Aaron sneakily walks in.
He just can't keep away.

38:54.840 --> 38:56.080
No, because...
Go on.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.080
Right!

38:59.160 --> 39:03.440
In a weird way, I'm pleased.
We're getting stuff off our chest

39:03.520 --> 39:06.240
and this has needed to happen
for a very long time.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.400
Come here.
(cries)

39:08.480 --> 39:10.240
Just...
No.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.160
I know how hard it was, Charl.
No, it's not like that.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.200
OK, OK, OK. Come here.

39:22.760 --> 39:24.680
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

39:24.760 --> 39:27.440
It's always been like this
from day one.

39:30.920 --> 39:34.280
Yet again, I just feel like
I was never good enough.

39:34.360 --> 39:37.520
Like I was always just second best.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.640
I could never have been
the one for Gary.

39:39.720 --> 39:43.160
I was just someone to pass the time
while he waited for someone else.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.360
Shut up. Let us speak.

39:46.440 --> 39:51.520
I have cared for you like... like...
you wouldn't even imagine.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.920
And...

39:56.840 --> 39:59.520
You didn't care. Don't lie.
You didn't care.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.400
When Charlotte got with Mitch,
I didn't say a word.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.800
I gave her that space she needed
to move on.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.400
And now, I need the same.

40:06.480 --> 40:09.840
Why didn't we try anything? Why?
I don't know.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.040
What was the reason?

40:11.120 --> 40:14.600
Cos now I'm saying it, why?! Why?!
I don't know.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.400
Well, I just don't understand.

40:19.720 --> 40:20.840
We didn't.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.280
What has she give him what I haven't
over the past four years

40:36.360 --> 40:39.040
But I forgot,
we're just best friends.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.760
You do. And not as best friends.

40:59.280 --> 41:02.600
I can't give Charlotte
all the answers cos I don't know.

41:02.680 --> 41:06.200
I'm not saying Charlotte's
not pretty enough, or funny enough.

41:06.280 --> 41:09.800
We just never gave it a go. I just
wanna do is put all this behind us

41:09.880 --> 41:11.720
and have some kind of friendship.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.880
OK? Tonight's been hard.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.800
I've got everything out in the open.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.480
But I just feel like
me heart's been shattered.

41:25.560 --> 41:28.600
And it's gonna take a long time
for us to get over this.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.600
(sighs)

41:59.600 --> 41:59.800
.
