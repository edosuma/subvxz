request local units attend.

01:34.357 --> 01:36.256
Help! My baby!

01:36.257 --> 01:38.276

Charlie Zulu Five Five. Standing by.

01:38.277 --> 01:39.797

01:40.997 --> 01:43.116

We're giving assistance
until locals attend then we'll TL.

01:51.284 --> 01:53.660
- Copy all, skip.
- My baby!

01:54.357 --> 01:56.876
I can't get her out!

01:56.877 --> 02:00.116
Control, Charlie Zulu Five Five,

02:40.437 --> 02:43.140
Two minutes! Take the lorry!

02:44.203 --> 02:46.683
No time for that soft lad. Let him go!

02:46.797 --> 02:48.356
Come on!

02:48.357 --> 02:50.117
Come on, let's go.

02:51.117 --> 02:52.996
We need to get the gear out of here!

02:52.997 --> 02:54.716
Move the lorry.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.700
Let's move! Let's move!

03:00.437 --> 03:03.116
Control, Charlie Zulu Five Five,
are you receiving?

03:03.117 --> 03:04.956
If she's alive, finish her!

03:07.197 --> 03:10.980
Can I slow
patrols down? Five Five, receiving?

03:12.317 --> 03:13.516
She's a goner!

03:13.517 --> 03:15.436
Come on! Let's go!

03:15.437 --> 03:18.326
Control Charlie Zulu Five Five,
request sit rep?

03:24.227 --> 03:26.596
Control Charlie Zulu Five Five,

03:26.597 --> 03:28.916
Status Zero, Brown Lane,

03:28.917 --> 03:32.596
ED-905 hijacked by armed suspects.

03:32.597 --> 03:36.156
All units, transport
ED-905 has been hijacked.

03:36.157 --> 03:38.356
Request units to Brown Lane
to assist with officers.

03:38.357 --> 03:41.260
State Zero and all units obs on.

03:48.317 --> 03:49.677
Give.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.637
My favourite!

04:15.357 --> 04:17.100
Job done.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.396
Nice work, lads.

04:19.397 --> 04:22.100
Now let's get this lot shifted.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.476
Sir.

04:41.477 --> 04:42.916
What have we got?

04:42.917 --> 04:45.636
Hijack of a transport by
armed men wearing dark balaclavas.

04:45.637 --> 04:47.699
Three AFOs pronounced dead at the scene.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.236
Fourth critically wounded.

04:49.237 --> 04:50.740
Mother of God.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.276
The convoy was transporting
drugs from Eastfield Depot to the

04:54.277 --> 04:55.716
incineration facility.

04:55.717 --> 04:59.076
The firearms and balaclavas all fit
with the established OCG activity.

04:59.077 --> 05:00.676
As you were.

05:00.677 --> 05:03.476
The transport contained heroin
with a street value of ten million.

05:03.477 --> 05:06.669
Now the drugs themselves were
code number ED-905,

05:06.670 --> 05:08.516
originally seized about 18 months ago.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.956
So the chances are the OCG that
paid for it in the first place

05:10.957 --> 05:13.716
wanted it back, or maybe a rival OCG did.

05:13.717 --> 05:16.716
Either way, ED-905's back
in the hands of organised crime.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.236
Yeah, well, one thing's for sure,
they certainly had access

05:19.237 --> 05:20.468
to inside information. OK.

05:20.469 --> 05:23.076
Steve, Kate,
consider yourselves assigned.

05:23.077 --> 05:24.248
Find that leak.

05:24.273 --> 05:25.356
- Sir.
- Sir.

05:25.357 --> 05:28.037
- Steve, are you OK to open a case number?
- Ma'am.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.619
Maneet.

05:32.620 --> 05:33.641
Sarge.

05:33.666 --> 05:36.100
We need to open a case file
on the Eastfield hijack.

05:42.237 --> 05:43.637
Evening.

05:47.437 --> 05:48.597
Cheers.

05:53.757 --> 05:57.236
PS Cafferty, DI Fleming, AC-12.

05:57.237 --> 06:00.180
DS Arnott. We're sorry about what
happened to your team this morning.

06:00.677 --> 06:02.813
The doctor said you might be
up for answering some questions

06:02.814 --> 06:04.180
about the hijack.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.636
No-one said AC-12 were on this.

06:06.637 --> 06:08.996
We've just opened our inquiry.

06:08.997 --> 06:12.156
We've listened to recordings
of your RT with Control.

06:12.157 --> 06:13.877
This is the transcript.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.636
Now, initially you decided
to follow procedure

06:17.637 --> 06:20.461
and continue the convoy,
and then you changed your mind

06:20.462 --> 06:22.916
and attended the alleged
road traffic collision.

06:22.917 --> 06:25.140
There's no "alleged", ma'am.

06:26.020 --> 06:27.996
I saw a mother fighting to save her baby.

06:27.997 --> 06:30.484
I've got kids of my own.
What else was I going to do?

06:30.740 --> 06:32.780
It must've been very distressing for you.

06:33.277 --> 06:35.516
There was immediate
threat to life, ma'am.

06:35.517 --> 06:38.276
I did my duty as a police officer.

06:38.277 --> 06:40.457
No-one's accusing you of anything, Jane.

06:40.482 --> 06:41.700
Yet.

06:42.077 --> 06:45.116
The OCG didn't look into a crystal ball.

06:45.117 --> 06:47.676
The hijack required inside information.

06:47.677 --> 06:50.497
Anyone spared immediately
becomes a person of interest.

06:50.498 --> 06:53.167
And I'm not telling you anything
you don't already know, Sarge.

06:53.168 --> 06:56.319
The lorry driver got away
without so much as a scratch.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.836
We've learned he didn't get told
the itinerary till a few minutes

06:58.837 --> 07:02.138
before you all set off, and there's
no activity on his phone.

07:02.139 --> 07:04.956
I never said a word to anyone outside

07:04.957 --> 07:07.540
the chain of command about ED-905.

07:08.437 --> 07:10.460
I was lucky, that's all.

07:10.917 --> 07:13.356
You were the only female officer.

07:13.357 --> 07:15.556
- So?
- The only parent.

07:15.557 --> 07:16.996
Yeah.

07:16.997 --> 07:18.956
It wasn't just knowing the itinerary.

07:18.957 --> 07:21.660
The hijackers needed the convoy to stop.

07:22.517 --> 07:24.596
They were counting on
someone ordering your team

07:24.597 --> 07:27.276
back to the burning car
to rescue a child.

07:27.277 --> 07:31.380
Whoever was leaking information
to the OCG, they knew about you.

07:35.717 --> 07:37.116
What, is it?

07:37.117 --> 07:39.557
I haven't told you
the whole truth, ma'am.

07:42.757 --> 07:45.260
- Go on.
- I was spared.

07:46.557 --> 07:49.660
I didn't say, because
I knew you'd be suspicious.

07:50.660 --> 07:53.637
The woman in the car,
the woman who set the trap...

07:55.277 --> 07:58.517
...maybe she didn't want to
leave my kids without a mum.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.376
I don't know.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.237
Whatever the reason, she told
the others that I was dead.

08:07.357 --> 08:09.180
She saved my life.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.477
Can you describe this woman?

08:22.292 --> 08:26.196
The three officers were
PC Kevin Greysham, PC Ray Randhawa

08:26.197 --> 08:27.996
and PC Carl Waldhouse.

08:27.997 --> 08:31.836
All highly trained, authorised
firearms officers.

08:31.837 --> 08:35.596
Our thoughts are with their families
at this very difficult time.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.703
The fourth officer, whose name
and location we're withholding

08:38.705 --> 08:42.220
for her own protection,
is expected to make a complete...

08:51.877 --> 08:53.343
I ended up in a lap-dancing bar.

08:53.368 --> 08:54.396
- Sparkles.
- Yeah.

08:54.397 --> 08:56.516
- I met this worldy.
- Oh, yeah.

08:56.517 --> 08:59.956
She had some bangers on her. Proper.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.276
She's jumping up and down
and that and the room's shaking

09:02.277 --> 09:03.424
and everything, but they didn't move!

09:03.425 --> 09:05.557
Sorry. John, you got a minute?

09:06.717 --> 09:08.157
Yeah, go ahead.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.317
Lise.

09:16.597 --> 09:19.517
I need to tell you something
so that it comes from me first.

09:21.877 --> 09:23.500
The fourth copper...

09:24.237 --> 09:25.837
...she survived.

09:27.917 --> 09:29.740
But you said she was a goner.

09:30.117 --> 09:31.916
I'm not a doctor.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.517
She can ID you.

09:35.490 --> 09:37.290
I'll make it up.

09:39.816 --> 09:41.456
Tell me how.

09:52.637 --> 09:54.156
Not late am I, Sarge?

09:54.157 --> 09:55.396
I'm early.

09:55.397 --> 09:56.796
- Any leads yet?
- Sorry, Sarge.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.076
We're looking at everyone
with knowledge of ED-905.

09:59.077 --> 10:00.316
Nothing yet.

10:00.317 --> 10:01.636
We'll keep working on it.

10:01.637 --> 10:02.997
All right. Cheers.

10:04.797 --> 10:07.316
All right, Maneet. How's the little 'un?

10:07.317 --> 10:09.716
Oh, he's talking all the time now.

10:09.717 --> 10:11.557
- He never shuts up.
- Let's have a look.

10:12.757 --> 10:14.156
Aw! Bless him.

10:14.157 --> 10:15.491
- What's wrong, baby?
- Mummy!

10:15.516 --> 10:16.516
Yeah. Mummy's here.

10:16.517 --> 10:17.700
- What? What?
- Ah, bless him.

10:17.725 --> 10:19.420
- No, Mummy!
- What?

10:20.357 --> 10:22.796
Your feet are so sticky!
I think it's bath time.

10:22.797 --> 10:26.598
Sarge, re the nominal,
I think I might've got something.

10:26.599 --> 10:28.716
Oh, sorry, Maneet.

10:28.717 --> 10:30.796
A betting shop robbery three months ago.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.996
Armed men wearing dark balaclavas.

10:32.997 --> 10:35.716
A female accomplice diverted
staff by claiming her baby had

10:35.717 --> 10:37.476
stopped breathing.

10:37.477 --> 10:39.500
The baby turned out to be a doll.

10:41.837 --> 10:44.316
- Is there a description of the nominal?
- CCTV?

10:44.317 --> 10:45.716
That's the thing, ma'am.

10:45.717 --> 10:48.196
The CCTV's been sequestered.

10:48.197 --> 10:50.796
I tried to access the
details and I was blocked.

10:50.797 --> 10:52.197
Blocked?

10:52.660 --> 10:54.197
What's the case number?

11:10.717 --> 11:12.357
Thanks, Tatleen.

11:28.477 --> 11:29.796
You all right?

11:29.797 --> 11:31.436
All right.

11:31.437 --> 11:35.436
There was a code associated with
the MOPI Notice, C-1601.

11:35.437 --> 11:39.093
C-1601 blocks access to
aspects of a number of cases

11:39.094 --> 11:41.836
and one name kept coming up
as the authorising officer.

11:41.837 --> 11:43.996
Detective Superintendent Alison Powell.

11:43.997 --> 11:46.276
- Never heard of her.
- No. Me neither.

11:46.277 --> 11:47.916
What is this place?

11:47.917 --> 11:49.477
I thought you might know.

11:56.997 --> 11:59.516
DI Fleming, DS Arnott, AC-12.

11:59.517 --> 12:01.757
We've got an appointment with DSU Powell.

12:04.677 --> 12:05.997
They're here.

12:09.517 --> 12:11.060
Alison Powell.

12:22.317 --> 12:23.796
Sir?

12:23.797 --> 12:25.860
- Sir?
- Kate, Steve.

12:27.517 --> 12:31.196
Management of Police Information
exists for a reason.

12:31.197 --> 12:33.116
When you encountered the MOPI Notice,

12:33.117 --> 12:36.716
you set off an electronic tripwire.
I was prepared to overlook that.

12:36.717 --> 12:39.116
And then when your office
requested a meeting, I thought

12:39.117 --> 12:41.516
it best to consult
with Superintendent Hastings.

12:41.517 --> 12:43.676
They are my best team.

12:43.677 --> 12:45.596
They'll get to the root of anything.

12:45.597 --> 12:47.036
The root being what, sir?

12:47.037 --> 12:49.556
Access to certain case
files has been restricted due

12:49.557 --> 12:50.996
to their sensitivity.

12:50.997 --> 12:53.196
I'm not at liberty
to disclose the details,

12:53.197 --> 12:54.996
not even to Superintendent Hastings.

12:54.997 --> 12:58.940
He's here to assure you that there
is nothing unlawful going on.

13:00.197 --> 13:04.916
AC-12 have stumbled on an extremely
sensitive undercover operation.

13:04.917 --> 13:09.036
Is there a UCO embedded in the OCG
that carried out the heroin hijack?

13:09.037 --> 13:11.396
As a former UCO yourself,
DI Fleming, you know

13:11.397 --> 13:12.876
I can't confirm or deny.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.236
I'm a bit baffled here

13:14.237 --> 13:17.876
because I've no idea what
this place is or what you do.

13:17.877 --> 13:20.876
I've been brought in from an
outside force to lead on

13:20.877 --> 13:23.516
a specific operation,
authorised at the highest level,

13:23.517 --> 13:26.197
and we've done a good
job of keeping it hidden.

13:26.463 --> 13:27.863
Till now.

13:28.837 --> 13:32.636
Three police officers
were killed in that hijack.

13:32.637 --> 13:36.396
I can assure you our UCO has not
been authorised to encourage,

13:36.397 --> 13:38.556
enable or commit criminal offences.

13:38.557 --> 13:41.316
Nonetheless, you might
want to extract your officer

13:41.317 --> 13:43.836
and submit some evidence
against the murderers.

13:43.837 --> 13:47.196
Our operation's at a critical stage.

13:47.197 --> 13:49.476
Best served by leaving
our asset in place.

13:49.477 --> 13:52.276
Ma'am, did your UCO provide
intelligence that facilitated

13:52.277 --> 13:54.860
arrests following
the betting shop robbery?

13:56.117 --> 14:00.420
As I said, AC-12 have
stumbled on an undercover operation.

14:03.477 --> 14:05.557
And now I need you all to stumble away.

14:17.877 --> 14:19.317
Ted.

14:24.477 --> 14:25.957
Alison.

14:43.277 --> 14:45.716
What the hell are you playing at,
not keeping me informed?

14:45.717 --> 14:48.476
Sir, it's my job as DI
to take on responsibility.

14:48.477 --> 14:51.387
I wanted to know we were definitely
onto something before I came

14:51.412 --> 14:52.660
knocking at your door.

14:53.117 --> 14:57.036
Sir, an undercover officer involved
in the hijack had a duty to warn

14:57.037 --> 14:59.356
their Covert Ops Manager
officers were in danger.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.636
Same goes for identifying
the betting-shop robber.

15:01.637 --> 15:04.154
Maybe she couldn't make contact
without breaking cover.

15:04.179 --> 15:05.253
She?

15:05.254 --> 15:08.076
You think the UCO's the nominal,
the one that saved Cafferty's life?

15:08.077 --> 15:10.468
Makes sense, sir.
She couldn't stop the hijack

15:10.469 --> 15:12.396
but the best she could do
was limit the loss of life.

15:12.397 --> 15:15.156
Oh, Christ. I've been there.
The lies, the fear.

15:15.157 --> 15:17.237
God only knows what she's going through.

15:34.877 --> 15:37.676
Sorry, Lise, we're loading up.

15:37.677 --> 15:39.237
I'll be right out.

15:50.877 --> 15:53.877
Right. Don't move, lights off,
keep the engine running.

16:14.797 --> 16:16.197
Just do it.

16:21.117 --> 16:23.277
You made his night there, Lise.

16:27.957 --> 16:29.476
Be right with you.

16:29.477 --> 16:31.636
You're all right, Slater.

16:31.637 --> 16:34.500
You take your time.
Shake off all the drips.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.756
You the guys?

16:45.757 --> 16:48.620
Yeah. Yeah, we're the guys.

16:52.117 --> 16:53.700
This your bird?

16:54.237 --> 16:55.700
Bit personal.

16:56.536 --> 16:58.296
Is he yours?

17:00.117 --> 17:03.460
Now the pissing contest's over
with maybe we can talk business.

17:04.277 --> 17:06.099
No business to talk.

17:06.517 --> 17:08.236
You got our merchandise.

17:08.237 --> 17:11.076
Ours, bought and paid for.

17:11.077 --> 17:15.636
Except you lost it and we ventured
some resources into recovering it.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.276
You want a finder's fee.

17:17.277 --> 17:19.356
Call it what you want, mate.

17:19.357 --> 17:20.980
I'd call it half.

17:22.516 --> 17:24.116
What you got is ours.

17:25.396 --> 17:28.836
The filth seizing it way back
when don't make no difference.

17:28.837 --> 17:32.260
Are you going to try putting
it on the street? Our gear?

17:33.917 --> 17:36.236
That's why we should make a deal.

17:36.237 --> 17:39.100
Avoid any conflict of ownership.

17:40.397 --> 17:42.340
I got no problem with conflicts.

17:42.997 --> 17:44.477
Me neither.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.037
Three dead coppers tell you that.

17:52.317 --> 17:55.397
Fight over the merchandise, we both lose.

17:55.696 --> 17:57.136
Make a deal...

17:58.309 --> 17:59.589
...we both win.

18:01.409 --> 18:03.049
She your bird or what?

18:04.717 --> 18:06.916
This is a professional meeting.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.237
I'm here in a professional capacity.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.116
Look at him, not me.

18:12.117 --> 18:15.020
- He's talking sense.
- 50-50.

18:16.317 --> 18:18.356
Half the merchandise

18:18.357 --> 18:20.796
or half the street value.

18:20.797 --> 18:22.837
Makes no difference to us.

18:24.357 --> 18:25.677
50-50 ain't going to happen.

18:27.997 --> 18:29.596
10%.

18:29.597 --> 18:32.860
No, we're facing life for
murdering three coppers, Slater.

18:35.357 --> 18:37.436
That ain't 10%.

18:37.437 --> 18:41.917
We both know you can shift that gear
for ten times what you paid for it.

18:42.169 --> 18:43.649
The numbers work.

18:44.837 --> 18:46.637
Everyone wins.

18:56.957 --> 18:58.581
- Cheers, lad.
- Ta.

18:58.582 --> 19:00.716
I thought we'd lost you for the night.

19:00.717 --> 19:03.396
Just needed a minute
in private, that's all.

19:03.397 --> 19:04.957
Here you are.

19:06.477 --> 19:07.796
Not in the mood, mate.

19:07.797 --> 19:09.476
Come on, Lise.

19:09.477 --> 19:11.356
Don't be stupid. Have a little bump.

19:11.357 --> 19:13.396
Celebrations are a bit
premature, aren't they?

19:13.397 --> 19:14.916
I'll be fine.

19:14.917 --> 19:17.207
We can't trust them, John.
We don't know them.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.819
Look. You don't need to know
someone to play a game.

19:19.820 --> 19:21.905
There's no point talking to
you when you're off your face.

19:21.906 --> 19:23.824
We're getting into business
with bad people.

19:23.825 --> 19:25.637
We're bad people!

19:28.157 --> 19:29.916
Whoa! Look at this.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.116
Now, here we go.

19:31.117 --> 19:33.276
Now the celebrations can really begin!

19:33.277 --> 19:35.357
A pair of crackers! Look at them.

19:36.350 --> 19:38.116
I'll have the two of you.

19:38.117 --> 19:39.636
- Oi, oi!
- Chill out.

19:39.637 --> 19:41.276
What about me?

19:41.277 --> 19:42.997
Get your own.

20:00.537 --> 20:02.377
Sorry, Sarge, have you got a minute?

20:02.790 --> 20:04.150
Yeah.

20:13.557 --> 20:15.180
We've been checking out
officers that were aware

20:15.181 --> 20:16.996
of transport ED-905.

20:16.997 --> 20:19.436
As per instructions, I've been
searching for officers with

20:19.437 --> 20:21.556
any kind of disciplinary record.

20:21.557 --> 20:23.636
Vihaan Malhotra.

20:23.637 --> 20:25.836
Civilian Administrator.

20:25.837 --> 20:28.436
He's one of the staff involved
in organising the processing

20:28.437 --> 20:30.956
and disposal of controlled substances.

20:30.957 --> 20:33.316
Repeated minor disciplinary offences,

20:33.317 --> 20:36.636
mainly for poor time keeping
and irregularities with expenses.

20:36.637 --> 20:38.076
So, what's the problem?

20:38.077 --> 20:40.140
His name came up early on.

20:41.237 --> 20:42.716
I showed the file to Maneet.

20:42.717 --> 20:45.716
I'm not sure why she didn't
think it was worth investigating.

20:45.717 --> 20:47.637
She knows what she's doing.

20:48.049 --> 20:49.449
Sorry.

20:49.747 --> 20:50.980
You're right.

21:08.877 --> 21:10.460
Sit down, Vihaan.

21:10.917 --> 21:13.436
DS Arnott, DI Fleming.

21:13.437 --> 21:15.556
Like to ask you some
questions about the hijack

21:15.557 --> 21:18.596
of seized goods transport ED-905.

21:18.597 --> 21:20.196
Sure, yeah.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.356
Your job here is to
sign off on Seized Goods

21:22.357 --> 21:24.436
when they're no longer
required in evidence.

21:24.437 --> 21:26.556
Our inquiries show you
were responsible for some

21:26.557 --> 21:28.388
- of the paperwork on ED-905.
- Not just that one.

21:28.389 --> 21:30.037
I'm across lots of...

21:32.717 --> 21:34.700
You seem nervous, Vihaan.

21:35.709 --> 21:37.389
Why are you nervous?

21:38.197 --> 21:39.996
Has someone been talking about me?

21:39.997 --> 21:43.397
We did some basic background
checks on you, Vihaan, that's all.

21:46.940 --> 21:48.837
Anything you want to confide?

21:50.117 --> 21:51.757
No.

21:57.856 --> 21:59.256
Vihaan?

22:05.689 --> 22:07.329
I...

22:10.477 --> 22:12.197
I need a glass of water.

22:27.789 --> 22:30.069
Down! Stay down! Down!

22:30.094 --> 22:32.494
Down! Stay down!

22:32.677 --> 22:35.534
Vihaan Malhotra, you're under arrest
for conspiracy to commit robbery.

22:35.535 --> 22:37.507
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

22:37.508 --> 22:38.627
if you do not mention, when questioned,

22:38.628 --> 22:39.800
something you later rely on in court.

22:39.801 --> 22:42.260
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

22:43.397 --> 22:45.156
Steve, are you all right?

22:45.157 --> 22:46.887
Steve? You all right?

22:46.888 --> 22:48.727
Yeah, yeah.

22:48.728 --> 22:50.236
Do you need your back looking at?

22:50.237 --> 22:52.076
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.

22:52.077 --> 22:53.797
Come on, up. Move!

23:04.517 --> 23:05.996
- Hiya!
- Hey.

23:05.997 --> 23:07.556
Look who's back. How are you doing?

23:07.557 --> 23:09.276
Oh, something smells good!

23:09.277 --> 23:10.740
Proper treat.

23:11.597 --> 23:13.477
You all right?

23:45.837 --> 23:49.076
- Good to go, boss?
- Yeah, let's do this.

23:49.077 --> 23:50.756
Tatleen, is Maneet around?

23:50.757 --> 23:53.279
No, ma'am, called in sick today.
Stomach bug.

23:53.304 --> 23:54.540
OK, thanks.

24:01.317 --> 24:03.196
Document nine in your folders.

24:03.197 --> 24:05.516
Document nine shows calls
made from an unregistered

24:05.517 --> 24:08.276
pay-as-you-go phone,
a so-called burner phone,

24:08.277 --> 24:09.876
to contact other burner phones.

24:09.877 --> 24:12.596
Location triangulation
places your phone near your

24:12.597 --> 24:14.396
home address at the time of the calls.

24:14.397 --> 24:16.636
One of the phones you
were contacting has been

24:16.637 --> 24:21.276
retrospectively placed at the
hijack of transport ED-905.

24:21.277 --> 24:23.340
Did you make this call, Mr Malhotra?

24:26.437 --> 24:27.579
No comment.

24:27.580 --> 24:29.676
At your home, our search
team made a discovery

24:29.677 --> 24:33.676
under your floorboards, submitted
in evidence as item JLM-5.

24:33.677 --> 24:36.340
JLM-5 can be viewed in image 11...

24:40.677 --> 24:42.500
...and image 12.

24:42.917 --> 24:46.636
Used banknotes in the sum of £25,000.

24:46.637 --> 24:49.300
How do you account for
this finding, Mr Malhotra?

24:51.048 --> 24:52.920
- No comment.
- Mr Malhotra,

24:52.945 --> 24:55.435
have you been receiving bribes
from an organised crime group

24:55.436 --> 24:58.074
as an inducement to disclose
sensitive information regarding

24:58.075 --> 25:02.797
police operations, specifically
with respect to transport ED-905?

25:03.209 --> 25:04.889
No comment.

25:06.157 --> 25:08.396
OK, Mr Malhotra, whichever
way you want to play this,

25:08.397 --> 25:10.556
it makes no odds to me.

25:10.557 --> 25:13.196
I've consulted with the
Crown Prosecutor in respect

25:13.197 --> 25:17.276
of conspiracy to commit robbery
and malfeasance in a public office.

25:17.277 --> 25:19.996
And I'm satisfied she'll
agree that the threshold has been

25:19.997 --> 25:22.197
reached to charge you
with these offences.

25:23.437 --> 25:26.436
Also, given the loss of life,
I will be seeking authority to

25:26.437 --> 25:28.820
charge you with conspiracy to murder.

25:29.077 --> 25:31.916
And as you may know,
if convicted, conspiracy to murder

25:31.917 --> 25:34.220
carries a life sentence.

25:37.723 --> 25:39.323
No. No, wait.

25:39.348 --> 25:40.940
Come on, Vihaan.

25:41.877 --> 25:43.636
They never said people'd get killed.

25:43.637 --> 25:46.220
- Who did?
- Who contacted you, Vihaan?

25:46.877 --> 25:48.956
They said her was from
the betting company.

25:48.957 --> 25:50.500
A woman?

25:50.797 --> 25:54.556
Her said they had
a policy of offering people

25:54.557 --> 25:58.780
with big debts
a structured repayment programme.

25:59.117 --> 26:02.116
Her took details off me, everything.

26:02.117 --> 26:03.876
Her used the personal information

26:03.877 --> 26:06.796
I'd given her to find out
all about my private life

26:06.797 --> 26:09.555
and, if I don't do what her say,
her tell my whole family.

26:09.556 --> 26:11.340
Can you describe this woman, Vihaan?

26:12.900 --> 26:14.717
Young.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.740
Dark hair, mixed race.

26:19.837 --> 26:21.517
Pausing interview.

26:29.117 --> 26:31.997
The UCO recruited him
and then she never told anyone.

26:32.380 --> 26:34.236
Maybe she had to find
an informant as part of

26:34.237 --> 26:35.956
ingratiating herself into the OCG.

26:35.957 --> 26:38.196
Giving up Malhotra
risked blowing her cover.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.796
If she'd reported Malhotra,

26:39.797 --> 26:41.956
three coppers wouldn't be
in the morgue right now.

26:41.957 --> 26:44.436
No, this UCO, she's crossed the line.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.396
Powell stonewalled us.

26:46.397 --> 26:48.597
Let's see if Malhotra's more forthcoming.

26:49.917 --> 26:51.357
Resuming interview.

26:54.397 --> 26:56.996
Right. This woman,
how many times did you meet her?

26:56.997 --> 26:59.767
Just a couple of times,
first when her pretended

26:59.768 --> 27:03.476
to be from the betting company
and then when her blackmailed me.

27:03.477 --> 27:06.636
So, after that, how did you
maintain contact with this woman?

27:06.637 --> 27:08.156
No way.

27:08.157 --> 27:10.676
Any leads you can give us
tracing this woman, Vihaan,

27:10.677 --> 27:13.700
that would allow us to show the
court you've assisted our inquiry.

27:14.637 --> 27:16.357
Shorten my sentence, yeah?

27:19.597 --> 27:21.436
More like shorten my life expectancy.

27:21.437 --> 27:23.675
Vihaan, this is an urgent
investigation seeking

27:23.676 --> 27:25.158
hardened criminals.

27:25.183 --> 27:27.516
Three police officers
murdered in cold blood.

27:27.517 --> 27:29.996
We need to find these criminals
and put them behind bars.

27:29.997 --> 27:32.073
If you know names and you
aren't giving them to us,

27:32.074 --> 27:34.055
this is only going to
get worse for you, Vihaan.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.622
We're throwing you a lifeline here, mate.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.956
I know what you're up to.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.716
Don't act like I don't.

27:41.717 --> 27:43.116
What are we up to, Vihaan?

27:43.117 --> 27:45.396
Protecting one of your own.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.796
Her's the one pointed the finger at me

27:47.797 --> 27:50.276
and everyone's acting
like her never done nothing.

27:50.277 --> 27:52.596
We really don't know what
you're talking about, Vihaan.

27:52.597 --> 27:54.020
Bollocks.

27:54.517 --> 27:56.497
Her's as much to blame as me.

27:56.498 --> 27:58.700
Who? Who's as much to blame?

28:18.477 --> 28:20.957
We're good to go with Slater for a trade.

28:22.837 --> 28:24.780
- When?
- Tonight.

28:25.597 --> 28:26.956
Nice one.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.380
Is it?

28:29.826 --> 28:31.218
What do you mean?

28:31.219 --> 28:32.860
I look at you.

28:33.237 --> 28:37.836
There's a little voice telling me,
"She's soft. She's a bottler.

28:37.837 --> 28:39.557
"She'll drag us all down."

28:40.717 --> 28:43.260
- That's bollocks, John.
- Well, prove it.

28:44.136 --> 28:46.256
I want to put Slater out of business.

28:47.477 --> 28:50.196
Show me you're still worth some value.

28:50.197 --> 28:53.637
Or that little voice is
going to start telling me that

28:53.996 --> 28:56.436
I've gave you enough second chances.

29:16.317 --> 29:19.117
Right, it's all yours. I won't be far.

29:33.456 --> 29:35.216
Where's your boss?

29:36.549 --> 29:38.069
Tonight, I'm the boss.

29:40.876 --> 29:42.636
Bullshit.

29:43.797 --> 29:46.036
At most, you take care of the livestock.

29:46.037 --> 29:48.597
We're not selling livestock,
we're selling gear.

29:49.957 --> 29:51.940
Half the street value.

29:52.357 --> 29:54.236
Here's proof of our end.

29:54.237 --> 29:56.157
The rest's in the van outside.

30:06.357 --> 30:08.437
Half was what I agreed with your boss.

30:12.157 --> 30:13.540
Me and you...

30:14.820 --> 30:16.620
...we need to make a new deal.

30:19.943 --> 30:21.543
25%.

30:29.469 --> 30:31.709
25%.

30:37.017 --> 30:38.737
That works.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.210
What's in the van's all yours.

30:43.397 --> 30:45.477
But what's in the van's half the gear.

30:46.717 --> 30:50.156
My boss delivers the rest
once you stump up the other 25%.

30:50.157 --> 30:53.980
Or we could just piss around
all night playing games, Slater.

30:56.103 --> 30:57.820
You seem to like that.

31:06.517 --> 31:10.036
Hey. We're minted!

31:10.037 --> 31:12.476
- Lise!
- Never in doubt, eh.

31:12.477 --> 31:14.756
One last thing before we're even.

31:14.757 --> 31:16.836
Mark Malhotra's card.

31:16.837 --> 31:19.436
Make sure he's 100%
acquainted with the consequences

31:19.437 --> 31:21.357
if he talks about the hijack.

31:23.517 --> 31:25.660
He's already shitting bricks, John.

31:27.077 --> 31:29.677
Now let's not go falling
out again, eh, Lise?

31:32.357 --> 31:33.997
Cheers.

31:46.157 --> 31:47.796
PC Paul Harris and PC Bindra.

31:47.797 --> 31:49.436
Could you just sign in, please?

31:49.437 --> 31:50.796
I can't bear this.

31:50.797 --> 31:52.317
Me neither.

32:00.197 --> 32:01.757
Get set up.

32:03.517 --> 32:05.037
Sir. Sir.

32:27.837 --> 32:30.876
AC-12 interview of Police Constable
Maneet Bindra, in the presence

32:30.877 --> 32:32.516
of her Police Federation rep,

32:32.517 --> 32:35.780
by Superintendent Hastings,
DI Fleming, DS Arnott.

32:37.117 --> 32:39.053
PC Bindra, you do not
have to say anything

32:39.054 --> 32:40.852
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

32:40.853 --> 32:43.394
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.528
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

32:46.363 --> 32:47.963
Document eight.

32:49.557 --> 32:52.076
Document eight is a statement
by a member of civilian staff,

32:52.077 --> 32:54.676
Vihaan Malhotra, confessing to disclosing

32:54.677 --> 32:56.996
confidential information
about police operations

32:56.997 --> 32:59.157
to an organised crime group.

32:59.450 --> 33:01.930
What is your relationship
with Vihaan Malhotra?

33:04.076 --> 33:05.596
He's my cousin, ma'am.

33:06.957 --> 33:10.276
Did you deliberately suppress a lead
that would have led us to Malhotra?

33:10.277 --> 33:15.500
A person instrumental in the
hijacking of dangerous narcotics.

33:19.317 --> 33:20.540
I'm sorry.

33:20.565 --> 33:23.100
So you were aware of Malhotra's offences?

33:25.797 --> 33:27.620
PC Bindra?

33:28.037 --> 33:33.312
No, sir, I wasn't aware Vihaan
was passing information to an OCG.

33:33.313 --> 33:37.796
Information that put
three officers in the morgue

33:37.797 --> 33:40.180
and one but for the grace of God!

33:45.196 --> 33:46.836
Document two in your folders.

33:48.117 --> 33:50.676
Document two is a summary of
an internal investigation

33:50.677 --> 33:52.876
into information leakage
that occurred following

33:52.877 --> 33:56.636
the disciplinary proceedings
against DC Jamie Desford.

33:56.637 --> 34:01.796
On screen, video one, an AV
recording of PC Bindra's statement

34:01.797 --> 34:03.860
in respect of the foregoing.

34:04.197 --> 34:06.716
Desford's already
been served a red notice

34:06.717 --> 34:08.556
for his activities in collusion

34:08.556 --> 34:10.956
with Assistant Chief
Constable Derek Hilton.

34:10.956 --> 34:14.525
Yet Desford denies
disclosing sensitive AC-12 files

34:14.525 --> 34:15.956
to Hilton.

34:15.956 --> 34:18.835
Desford claims to have been
deceived in disclosing his username

34:18.837 --> 34:21.076
and password by you.

34:21.077 --> 34:23.320
You've got no evidence
to put her fingers on that keyboard.

34:23.321 --> 34:26.583
Look. Let's stop beating
about the bush, PC Bindra.

34:26.583 --> 34:29.733
Did you use Desford's log-in information

34:29.734 --> 34:33.059
to download confidential files,
which you then passed on

34:33.060 --> 34:35.260
to Assistant Chief Constable Hilton?

34:36.556 --> 34:37.956
Yes, or no?

34:37.956 --> 34:39.900
No, sir, absolutely not.

34:45.036 --> 34:46.556
You work with someone...

34:48.996 --> 34:50.516
...you take them at their word.

34:52.036 --> 34:53.755
More fool me.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.740
Continuing with document eight.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.188
Vihaan Malhotra alleges you
supplied confidential AC-12 files

35:04.189 --> 35:07.476
to Assistant Chief Constable Hilton
in return for Hilton's silence

35:07.477 --> 35:09.957
regarding Malhotra's offences.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.636
No.

35:13.230 --> 35:14.630
No?

35:16.037 --> 35:18.681
I never knew it was so bad,
what Vihaan was doing,

35:18.682 --> 35:20.596
otherwise I'd never have
gone along with it.

35:20.597 --> 35:21.997
Along with what?

35:23.957 --> 35:27.076
It's true ACC Hilton
used Vihaan to blackmail me.

35:27.077 --> 35:29.116
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

35:29.117 --> 35:32.636
You've got to believe me, sir,
when I tell you Hilton never said

35:32.637 --> 35:36.396
anything about Vihaan
leaking information to an OCG.

35:36.397 --> 35:37.676
He only told me

35:37.677 --> 35:40.876
Vihaan was in danger of dismissal
over his personal problems.

35:40.877 --> 35:45.076
I wanted Vihaan to have a chance
of kicking his gambling addiction.

35:45.077 --> 35:48.596
Hilton said that
he'd pull strings for Vihaan

35:48.597 --> 35:51.716
if I agreed to keep him
in the loop on AC-12 operations.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.636
You were spying on us!

35:53.637 --> 35:55.836
Sir, he was the ACC.

35:55.837 --> 35:58.060
I honestly believed it was lawful.

35:59.597 --> 36:01.476
Then he put more pressure on me,

36:01.477 --> 36:03.876
to reveal more
and more sensitive material.

36:03.877 --> 36:05.236
You could've come to me!

36:05.237 --> 36:06.676
I stopped, sir.

36:06.677 --> 36:09.036
I took early maternity leave.

36:09.037 --> 36:11.180
I couldn't bear what I was doing.

36:12.317 --> 36:14.749
Nothing I can say can
make up for what I did.

36:14.750 --> 36:16.540
Yeah, you're not wrong there.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.956
Sir, there's no evidence Maneet
knew Malhotra was

36:26.957 --> 36:29.236
leaking information to an OCG.

36:29.237 --> 36:33.436
And apart from this, sir, she
has got a spotless service history.

36:33.437 --> 36:35.436
Do you hear that, do you?
Do you hear that?

36:35.437 --> 36:36.876
That's good people.

36:36.877 --> 36:38.196
Honest people.

36:38.197 --> 36:40.140
Sticking up for one of their own.

36:40.837 --> 36:43.740
But you have made a mockery of that.

36:44.757 --> 36:46.596
You are finished here, Constable,

36:46.597 --> 36:49.916
you are finished with the force
and that's only the start of it.

36:49.917 --> 36:54.556
Christ knows what criminal charges
you're going to end up facing!

36:54.557 --> 36:56.996
Superintendent Hastings leaving the room

36:56.997 --> 36:59.700
before I say something
I'm going to regret.

37:27.197 --> 37:30.517
Thank you, everybody, can I have
your attention, please? Thanks.

37:32.157 --> 37:35.516
Well, it's been one hell of a
journey to this point, hasn't it?

37:35.517 --> 37:38.700
And it's been a right few ups
and downs along the way.

37:40.277 --> 37:43.516
We've even had to suffer corrupt
police officers in our midst.

37:43.517 --> 37:45.516
But small mercies.

37:45.517 --> 37:49.836
Maneet's confession has put
the final nail in Hilton's coffin.

37:49.837 --> 37:52.916
Hilton knew about Malhotra.
Oh, yeah, he was the one.

37:52.917 --> 37:55.436
He was the senior
police officer who was running

37:55.437 --> 37:58.037
the show for organised crime.

37:59.477 --> 38:04.500
Killing himself was the only
decent thing that man ever did.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.516
H.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.020
Finally.

38:10.677 --> 38:12.636
Well done, everybody.

38:12.637 --> 38:14.276
Well done.

38:14.277 --> 38:17.876
And to celebrate, I am going to put
a few bob behind the bar

38:17.877 --> 38:21.036
in the Red Lion tonight so you can
all have a drink on the gaffer.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.871
And that is something that does
not happen every day. Correct?

38:23.872 --> 38:24.945
That's true, yeah!

38:24.970 --> 38:27.356
So carry on. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

38:27.357 --> 38:28.420
Sir.

38:33.357 --> 38:35.396
Maneet links to Hilton.

38:35.397 --> 38:38.236
Hilton to Malhotra. Malhotra to the OCG.

38:38.237 --> 38:40.956
And now there's a UCO inside the OCG.

38:40.957 --> 38:42.756
If anyone can prove the gaffer right,

38:42.757 --> 38:45.916
that Hilton was the one pulling
the strings, it's her.

38:45.917 --> 38:47.477
Or prove him wrong.

38:49.037 --> 38:50.717
We need to find her.

39:26.717 --> 39:27.997
Oh, my God.

39:29.650 --> 39:31.370
I fell down the stairs.

39:33.557 --> 39:34.917
Vihaan.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.260
You shouldn't be here.

39:41.717 --> 39:45.356
It's OK, I used a false name on the VO.

39:45.357 --> 39:47.797
Prison Liaison don't know
I'm a police officer.

39:49.477 --> 39:51.476
You can't do nothing.

39:51.477 --> 39:54.260
I can talk some sense into you.

39:55.637 --> 39:57.460
Why'd you even want to help me?

39:58.670 --> 40:00.390
I dobbed you in.

40:01.757 --> 40:03.620
You did the right thing.

40:04.317 --> 40:06.756
I've been living a lie.

40:06.757 --> 40:09.500
Keeping secrets from people
that I care about.

40:11.980 --> 40:15.580
I'm sorry, Maneet, for all of it.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.677
I know you are.

40:21.677 --> 40:24.557
Vihaan, come clean to AC-12.

40:25.597 --> 40:30.116
Tell them everything you know
and you'll be out of here sooner.

40:30.117 --> 40:31.980
Look at me.

40:32.357 --> 40:34.357
This is when I don't say nothing.

40:36.950 --> 40:40.980
I won't talk. I'd never talk.

40:44.397 --> 40:47.236
You always looked after me.

40:47.237 --> 40:49.036
I know.

40:49.037 --> 40:50.597
Hands!

40:53.462 --> 40:55.102
Help me, Maneet.

40:57.850 --> 40:59.610
I ain't up to this.

41:06.109 --> 41:07.989
Tell me how I can help.

41:51.437 --> 41:52.980
Nikki's phone.

41:53.397 --> 41:55.517
I've got a betting tip.

41:55.790 --> 41:57.430
Wrong number.

41:58.382 --> 42:00.260
Odds at 100 to 30.

42:02.070 --> 42:03.750
You sure?

42:06.110 --> 42:07.870
100 to 30.

42:08.877 --> 42:10.797
OK, don't move.

43:03.597 --> 43:05.420
You checked her over?

43:06.117 --> 43:08.997
No weapons, no recording devices.

43:09.402 --> 43:11.162
She's clean.

43:15.557 --> 43:17.460
So, what's all this about?

43:17.997 --> 43:20.100
Vihaan Malhotra.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.620
- He won't talk.
- He did talk.

43:23.277 --> 43:24.836
Told you how to get hold of us.

43:24.837 --> 43:26.197
And that's all.

43:27.357 --> 43:30.100
I want a guarantee he's safe inside.

43:30.517 --> 43:31.679
This is family.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.797
No, this is business.

43:34.797 --> 43:36.437
In return for information.

43:38.317 --> 43:39.677
About what?

43:42.197 --> 43:44.060
Police operations.

43:44.357 --> 43:46.917
Investigations that could
damage your business.

43:48.317 --> 43:51.540
I passed information to ACC Hilton.

43:57.117 --> 43:58.997
I could do the same for you.

44:06.957 --> 44:09.700
I've got an idea how we
could help each other out.

44:50.557 --> 44:52.036
Evening, Mr Hastings.

44:52.037 --> 44:53.677
Yeah. Evening.

44:55.837 --> 44:59.116
I just wanted to ask, is that
problem with the toilet fixed?

44:59.117 --> 45:00.636
All sorted, sir.

45:00.637 --> 45:02.076
Good. Good.

45:02.077 --> 45:04.916
Sorry, sir.
There's a reminder on your account.

45:04.917 --> 45:07.516
Oh, yeah, yeah. I think there
was some issue with that.

45:07.517 --> 45:09.996
I mean, I'll make sure
it gets paid next week.

45:09.997 --> 45:11.236
You know, banks!

45:11.237 --> 45:13.077
Screw everything up.

45:51.007 --> 45:53.007
_

46:04.717 --> 46:07.237
Christ sake, this
going to happen or what?

46:31.437 --> 46:33.156
Armed police!

46:33.157 --> 46:34.436
Armed police!

46:34.437 --> 46:36.837
- On your knees!
- On your knees!

46:44.117 --> 46:45.756
Where'd that come from?

46:45.757 --> 46:48.236
That weren't there before!

46:48.237 --> 46:49.756
What's the game, man?

46:49.757 --> 46:52.036
What's the game?

46:52.037 --> 46:53.555
Bastards!

46:53.556 --> 46:55.980
Sir, this way.

46:59.477 --> 47:01.077
Open it.

47:07.117 --> 47:08.837
Jackpot.

47:23.877 --> 47:25.020
All right.

47:25.940 --> 47:27.340
All right.

47:28.197 --> 47:29.836
What's AC-12's interest in this?

47:29.837 --> 47:31.380
Sorry, Sam.

47:31.997 --> 47:34.876
Detective Chief
Superintendent Hargreaves.

47:34.877 --> 47:37.876
Gaffer thinks he knows the
magic words to make them talk.

47:37.877 --> 47:39.316
Don't they all?

47:39.317 --> 47:41.340
What were you all up to tonight?

47:42.437 --> 47:44.356
No comment.

47:44.357 --> 47:47.380
That van full of H.

47:48.277 --> 47:52.157
Bit careless, to leave it there
for us to catch you red-handed.

47:52.403 --> 47:53.963
Not us.

47:55.597 --> 47:58.260
Are you trying to tell me
you didn't hijack the transport?

47:59.237 --> 48:00.860
Not us.

48:02.189 --> 48:03.789
Who then?

48:04.957 --> 48:06.717
Ask the bitch.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.876
A woman?

48:08.877 --> 48:10.397
One that set us up.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.637
Set you up how?

48:15.037 --> 48:16.956
Following the arrests made last night,

48:16.957 --> 48:19.996
the first round of interviews have
been completed by Serious Crime.

48:19.997 --> 48:22.556
The following allegations
have been made relating to

48:22.557 --> 48:26.596
controlled drugs seized by an OCG
in the hijack of transport ED-905.

48:26.597 --> 48:29.396
A portion of the heroin
was traded to a rival OCG

48:29.397 --> 48:31.316
for an extremely large amount of cash.

48:31.317 --> 48:33.436
A further trade was
arranged and the heroin

48:33.437 --> 48:36.076
planted at the scene in a van
to incriminate the rival OCG.

48:36.077 --> 48:37.660
Sir.

48:38.317 --> 48:40.636
It's been alleged the whole
thing was orchestrated by

48:40.637 --> 48:44.476
a female OCG member matching
the description of the nominal.

48:44.477 --> 48:47.276
Well, it sounds like the
UCO is finally getting some

48:47.277 --> 48:50.916
dangerous drugs off the street and
some hardened criminals behind bars.

48:50.917 --> 48:52.956
Except, sir, I looked into the tip-off

48:52.957 --> 48:56.557
and the caller used none of the code
words issued to undercover officers.

48:56.860 --> 48:58.580
We don't believe it was her, sir.

48:59.757 --> 49:01.317
Right.

49:02.997 --> 49:05.516
Well, let's see what
Detective Superintendent Powell

49:05.517 --> 49:07.700
has to say for herself this time.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.717
- All right.
- All right.

49:16.037 --> 49:17.476
What's up?

49:17.477 --> 49:18.797
You tell me.

49:21.077 --> 49:22.636
All went as planned.

49:22.637 --> 49:25.076
We set up the exchange
for the rest of the gear.

49:25.077 --> 49:27.436
The copper did her part, made a call.

49:27.437 --> 49:29.568
They're out of business.
You've got what you wanted.

49:29.997 --> 49:33.916
And this copper? Apart from
make a call, what's she done?

49:33.917 --> 49:36.157
- She's working on it.
- Working on it.

49:38.357 --> 49:40.837
Let's give her time to pan out,
one way or another.

49:42.077 --> 49:43.437
One way.

49:49.837 --> 49:51.557
Or another.

50:18.277 --> 50:20.356
Sorry, sorry. No idea where my head was.

50:20.357 --> 50:22.836
I'm in a rush,
let's just swap insurance details.

50:27.277 --> 50:29.597
Emergency, which service do you require?

50:44.437 --> 50:46.396
What have you got for us?

50:46.397 --> 50:48.780
I haven't had time to
work with my contacts.

50:50.037 --> 50:52.020
What contacts are these?

50:52.620 --> 50:54.156
They don't want anyone knowing.

50:54.157 --> 50:56.077
- You're full of shit.
- John.

50:59.437 --> 51:01.556
My men were following you.

51:01.557 --> 51:03.420
You were on your way to AC-12.

51:04.790 --> 51:06.030
That's not true.

51:07.837 --> 51:10.316
Every one of you is so
keen to believe this is all

51:10.317 --> 51:12.717
about protecting her idiot cousin.

51:13.103 --> 51:14.743
It's the truth!

51:17.923 --> 51:19.483
She got her burner on her?

51:33.356 --> 51:35.036
It's the one we gave her.

51:43.563 --> 51:45.363
Get me a screwdriver.

52:30.822 --> 52:32.382
Christ.

52:32.597 --> 52:35.230
You've got to believe me. It wasn't
there when we gave it to her, John.

52:35.231 --> 52:36.740
I'll deal with you later.

52:37.603 --> 52:39.283
Get out of my sight.

52:43.763 --> 52:45.483
What's going to happen?

52:48.637 --> 52:51.500
There's only one thing
worse than a bent copper,

52:52.670 --> 52:55.070
that's a bent copper
who pretends she isn't.

53:02.797 --> 53:04.796
No!

53:04.797 --> 53:06.836
No!

53:06.837 --> 53:09.076
No! Please!

53:39.517 --> 53:41.020
Right.

53:41.557 --> 53:44.894
So, we have a betting shop robbery,
we have the recruitment

53:44.895 --> 53:48.716
and blackmail of a civilian
administrator, we have a hijack,

53:48.717 --> 53:53.996
we have narcotics traded, we have a
rival organised crime gang framed.

53:53.997 --> 53:56.876
We have three police officers murdered,

53:56.877 --> 54:01.036
one seriously injured, and the
whole time, your UCO has failed to

54:01.037 --> 54:04.596
pass on any intelligence that would
have prevented these offences?

54:04.597 --> 54:06.036
I've already told you,

54:06.037 --> 54:09.876
I'm not at liberty to discuss
any ongoing undercover operation.

54:09.877 --> 54:14.556
I'll give you, "At liberty,"
Detective Superintendent Powell.

54:14.557 --> 54:18.556
If a UCO is committing crimes,
that's the business of AC-12.

54:18.557 --> 54:21.076
And if you have any doubts, you just
watch how fast I'm going to

54:21.077 --> 54:24.112
shut down this operation
and serve you, your COM

54:24.113 --> 54:26.900
and your UCO with Reg 15s.

54:37.596 --> 54:40.140
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

54:41.740 --> 54:44.596
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

54:44.597 --> 54:46.436
within an organised crime group.

54:46.437 --> 54:48.276
Now we're getting somewhere.

54:48.277 --> 54:50.437
So here's a simple question.

54:50.780 --> 54:53.540
Are you in contact
with your UCO or aren't you?

54:56.517 --> 54:58.076
Now listen, Alison.

54:58.077 --> 55:00.437
I didn't float up the Lagan on a bubble.

55:01.903 --> 55:03.263
Are you or aren't you?

55:05.476 --> 55:06.556
No.

55:08.437 --> 55:13.196
Right. So your COM's lost contact,
your cover officers, too?

55:13.197 --> 55:15.276
We're trying our best.

55:15.277 --> 55:16.877
- Christ.
- How long?

55:20.037 --> 55:24.236
How long has your Covert Operations
Manager not been in contact

55:24.237 --> 55:25.796
with your UCO?

55:25.797 --> 55:27.100
Days?

55:28.449 --> 55:29.889
Weeks?

55:31.716 --> 55:33.756
Mother of God, don't tell me it's months!

55:33.781 --> 55:37.221
We can't be certain what's happened.
It's a deep cover operation.

55:37.397 --> 55:39.476
He may still be acquiring intelligence

55:39.477 --> 55:41.317
on organised criminal activity.

55:41.610 --> 55:43.170
He?

55:54.397 --> 55:56.357
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

56:16.197 --> 56:18.397
Come on! Come on, you!

56:19.637 --> 56:22.660
Please! No, please!

56:32.197 --> 56:34.213
- No, no!
- Shut up!

56:34.214 --> 56:36.357
This ain't helping.
