02:21.080 --> 02:23.799
My car's thirsty.
Can I please have some water?

02:36.920 --> 02:40.959
God is good.
He has sent me a big, strong man.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.197
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I was just passing.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.834
But you did not pass.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.551
That is your... your car?

02:57.520 --> 03:00.080
That's my home.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.270
You fix und dann habe ich...

03:03.320 --> 03:06.869
I have something you do.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.835
I thank you very kindly, ma'am, but
I got places to go. Thanks for the water.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.239
If it's for hire,
you got yourself one man for one day.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.875
- Hire?
- You want me to work for you?

04:56.000 --> 05:00.278
For hire means for money. I could build
a better fence than your girls.

05:00.400 --> 05:04.916
Schwester Gertrude. Schwester Albertine.
Schwester Elizabeth. Schwester Agnes.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.429
I am Mother Maria.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.031
Pleased to meet you all. You've got a nice
family, ma'am. My name is Homer Smith.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.038
- Homer...?
- Homer Schmidt.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.116
Oh, Schmidt!

05:20.040 --> 05:23.749
Herr Schmidt, no fence.
We do that ourselves.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.996
Up there. The roof.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.431
- You fix?
- It couldn't be leaking on a day like this.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.915
- Roof only leaks when it rains.
- Was?

05:51.040 --> 05:53.031
I'm only kidding. I'll fix it good.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.870
- You use this.
- No, thanks. I've got my own.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.358
(exclaim in German)

06:13.160 --> 06:16.835
Can't do good work without good tools
and if you hire me, you get good work.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.916
Hire.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.068
Schwester, das Bett in die Scheune.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.315
- What's that?
- The bed you sleep.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.796
- No. I got my own arrangements.
- You sleep in here?

07:34.840 --> 07:39.356
Schwester, tragen Sie die Sachen zurück
ins Haus. Schmidt schläft in seinem Auto.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.914
No, no, you got it just a little bit wrong.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.476
The job is finished,
so you pay me and I take off.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.034
- Take off?
- Thatta way.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.958
You have such a hurry?

07:51.080 --> 07:56.279
I'm hungry. I figured I'd find me a chilli
wagon and log another hundred miles.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.473
We were not put on the earth
to hurry, Schmidt.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.875
For supper, I ring the bell.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.038
Schmidt!

08:31.080 --> 08:36.154
Jesu Christ, sei unser Gast und segne,
was du bescheret hast.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.111
Amen.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.436
Himmlischer Vater...

08:43.480 --> 08:46.119
Möge das Essen, das du uns gibst,

08:46.240 --> 08:50.711
Homer Schmidt stark machen,
damit er deinen Willen erfüllen kann.

08:51.440 --> 08:53.715
- Amen.
- Amen.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.555
Himmlischer Vater,

10:27.280 --> 10:29.555
Er sagt, wir leben
von den Früchten des Landes.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.636
Oh, ja! Ja!

10:33.160 --> 10:35.151
God sets a mighty poor table.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.272
Soon we will have vegetables too.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.596
And sometimes chicken.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.436
- Well...

10:49.480 --> 10:52.438
- Yes, ma'am.
- You smoke is all right.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.875
- I think I'd better be rolling.
- Do not make hurry.

from Austria and from Hungary.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.196
I'm sorry.

16:51.240 --> 16:56.109

16:57.640 --> 17:01.792
People have got to sleep. People
have got to have some joy in living.

17:01.920 --> 17:04.354
People gotta...

17:04.480 --> 17:06.232

- Come! Follow me.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.473

18:30.600 --> 18:33.717
Eine kleine Kirche. A cha... pel.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.516

- Ja, you.

18:50.880 --> 18:55.954
Not only am I ain't building no "shapel",
I'm taking off! I ain't no contractor.

Boy. Look, I'm checking out.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.440
All right. I'll clean out some of that stuff.

19:19.560 --> 19:22.233
I don't want those girls
to break their backs.

19:22.360 --> 19:26.239
Just to work off that tremendous breakfast
you fed me this morning.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.078
- Let's settle up.
- Ja, sind Sie denn nicht zufrieden?

19:28.200 --> 19:31.112
Wenn wir das gewusst hätten, hätten wir
Ihnen das Frühstück ans Bett gebracht.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.276
I hope you're not talking mean to me.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.393
You wanted your breakfast in bed?
You talk like American millionaire!

19:37.520 --> 19:39.988

20:44.000 --> 20:47.913
I milked the cow yesterday.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.589
I milk the cow today.

20:51.720 --> 20:55.269
I milk the cow tomorrow.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.868
Very good. Very good.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.389
- Very good, Schwester Elizabeth.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.671
Good night, Sister Albertine.

21:28.800 --> 21:33.430
Sister Agnes, you be up early.
You've got to milk that poor old cow.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.438
I milk the poor old cow.

21:39.440 --> 21:42.034
You like to make jokes, Schmidt?

21:46.000 --> 21:47.991
This isn't exactly a joke.

21:48.120 --> 21:51.112
Now I sit down.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.470
I give you a bill.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.751
You pay me for my services.

21:56.880 --> 22:01.032
I've put in two good days here, Mother.
I'm for hire, remember? Hire.

22:01.160 --> 22:03.435
I speak English not so good.

22:03.560 --> 22:06.870
You want to take advantage
of a poor country boy like me?

22:07.000 --> 22:09.150
OK.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.430
OK. We'll play it your way.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.838
Book of Luke, chapter ten, verse seven.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.030
Your Bible is all in German.

22:26.800 --> 22:29.234
I'll read it to you in English.

22:35.640 --> 22:39.792
"And in the same house remain, eating
and drinking such things as they give,

22:39.920 --> 22:43.993
for the labourer is worthy of his hire."

22:44.120 --> 22:47.590
That's not exactly what I had in mind
but you get the idea.

22:53.280 --> 22:56.192
What you got there? Proverbs 14.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.673
"Cast in thy lot amongst us,
let us all have one purse... "

23:06.800 --> 23:10.679
I am a poor man! I've got to work
for wages. I can't work for...

23:12.400 --> 23:16.029
Matthew... chapter six.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.948
Acht und zwanzig...

23:20.080 --> 23:22.355
Two-eight-two-nine.

23:22.480 --> 23:25.040
Matthew, chapter six, 28-29.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.875
Schmidt, read it in English.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.431
"Why take thee thought for raiment?"

23:38.560 --> 23:40.630
"Consider the lilies of the field
and how they grow."

23:40.760 --> 23:42.318
"They toil not, neither do they spin,

23:42.440 --> 23:45.398
yet I say unto you,
not even Solomon in all his glories

23:45.520 --> 23:47.636
was arrayed as one of these."

23:47.760 --> 23:50.228
Consider the lilies.

23:56.720 --> 23:59.188
- What's that?
- You go to bed.

23:59.320 --> 24:03.029
Tomorrow Sunday is.
The mass in town is nine by the clock.

24:03.160 --> 24:06.072
- I'm a Baptist. I don't go to mass.
- We go.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.875
- How'd you get there before?
- We walk every Sunday. Now we got you.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.560
Now dammit! You ain't got me!

24:12.680 --> 24:15.035
- Good night, Schmidt.
- Get that straight!

24:15.160 --> 24:17.390
- Schlafen Sie wohl.
- And cut that out.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.476
Bless you, Schmidt.

24:43.680 --> 24:46.240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.032
Morning.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.594
- No breakfast?
- Never before mass.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.032
Oh.

25:15.920 --> 25:18.753
You guys look nice - lean, but nice.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.916
- Where's it at?
- Was, Schmidt?

26:05.040 --> 26:07.838
The church.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.032
- Yeah, but where's it at?
- Er will wissen, wo die Kirche ist.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.557
- That's not fair.
- Over there, Schmidt.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.153
- Now come.
- No.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.191
I'm gonna wait in here for you.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.394
- Are you the man?
- I am the man.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.076
- Can I get me some breakfast?
- Name it.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.350
- A real breakfast?
- Whatever you say.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.313
Double OJ and squeeze it fresh.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.353
So?

27:00.480 --> 27:07.431
A stack of wheatcakes with lots
of melted butter... maple syrup.

27:08.400 --> 27:13.030
And fry me three, four, five eggs
with a mess of sausages

27:13.160 --> 27:17.119
and a mountain of white toast
with strawberry marmalade

27:17.240 --> 27:19.959
and... keep the coffee coming.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.149
- No beans?
- You got beans?

27:23.280 --> 27:25.635
- The most, señor.
- Them too.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.396
You take milk?

27:37.920 --> 27:42.550
- I said fresh.
- I squeezed it myself this morning.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.313
OK.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.230
Very nice.

27:52.360 --> 27:56.194
Very nice. Now...
melt some cheese over those beans.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.197
- What's the matter you're not in church?
- I'm a Baptist.

28:01.320 --> 28:04.790
- Why are you working for the sisters?
- I work for myself.

28:04.920 --> 28:08.356
- How come you're not in church?
- I got a business.

28:08.480 --> 28:12.553
- But you're a Catholic.
- No! I was born one, but...

28:14.040 --> 28:16.759
- Father Murphy...
- What's the matter with him?

28:16.880 --> 28:19.314
- He drinks.
- He's a priest.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.238
- He's Irish.
- Oh.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.116
Holy, holy, holy, hm?

28:28.240 --> 28:31.869
You pray hard enough and your stomach
doesn't feel empty any more.

28:32.000 --> 28:36.471
Praying does not pay the rent
and praying does not fill up the gas.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.797
God ain't gonna get behind
this counter and sling hash.

28:39.920 --> 28:42.354
Me? I gotta fill my wallet.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.750
- Hey.
- What?

28:47.880 --> 28:50.474
- They pay you?
- Sure.

28:50.600 --> 28:53.876
I just wondered.
I heard they don't have a cent.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.150
Not a cent.

28:56.280 --> 28:59.352
Crazy trying to farm that land.
They aren't mean enough.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.436
That old Mother, she'll do.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.120
Oh-h-h!

29:05.320 --> 29:08.278
Old Gus Ritter -
he used to own the place.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.278
He could grow potatoes on bare rock.

29:12.400 --> 29:15.472
He left the place
to this religious order in Germany.

29:15.600 --> 29:19.309
East Germany. The sisters
came over the Wall. They tell you that?

29:21.200 --> 29:23.919
- No. Like in Berlin?
- Sí.

29:24.040 --> 29:29.239
Over the Wall, across the ocean,
across the country to what? This.

29:30.280 --> 29:34.671
- They can't even talk the language.
- I've been straightening them out.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.394
- Yeah?
- Sho'nuff!

29:39.800 --> 29:43.395
Hey, listen. You ain't
gonna hang around with the sisters?

29:43.520 --> 29:47.433
- Nah. I'm just passing through.
- That's right!

29:47.560 --> 29:51.394
The sisters ask you something,
you tell them no. Keep right on going.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.875
- That pie there?
- Sure.

29:54.000 --> 29:57.117
- The whole one. Can I have it?
- It's gonna cost you.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.073
Wrap it. I'm a millionaire.
From Wall Street.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.351
- My name is Homer Smith.
- Juan Aquilito.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.838
Schmidt!

30:10.480 --> 30:11.913
Schmidt!

30:12.040 --> 30:15.828
- Schmidt!
- Looks like you're being paged.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.789
Das ist Schmidt.
Schmidt, Father Murphy.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.195
Father Murphy will talk with you.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.276
Pleased to meet you.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.874
Cuidado con los velos. Deprisa.

30:43.160 --> 30:45.594
Can we get out of this heat?

30:45.720 --> 30:48.029
I didn't know Catholics
had outdoor meetings.

30:48.160 --> 30:53.837
I got five other country clubs like this.
I cover about 400 miles a week.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.114
Welcome to the poor man's Vatican.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.673
Oh.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.955
Mother Superior tells me
she believes God sent you to her.

31:11.080 --> 31:15.232
No. I don't think he sent
a black Baptist to a Catholic nun!

31:15.360 --> 31:17.396
That's what she tells me.

31:18.360 --> 31:21.909
She also says
you're gonna build her a chapel.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.554
She asked me.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.877
But you know how it is.
I got other fish to fry.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.151
She believes there was a need
and she put her trust in prayer.

31:31.720 --> 31:33.676
When I was ordained, how I prayed.

31:33.800 --> 31:38.999
How I prayed for a call to a great majestic
cathedral in some wealthy diocese.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.192
I sent the message up in English,
in Latin, and he answered.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.912
He answered.

31:46.680 --> 31:50.195
I baptise them,
christen them, confirm them,

31:50.320 --> 31:54.279
hear their confessions, give absolution,
last rites, bless their remains,

31:54.400 --> 31:57.710
fill the tank, check the oil and water,
take off again and pray.

31:57.840 --> 32:01.196
Pray that I don't blow out
one of those old tyres.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.596
- You staying with the sisters?
- I'm just passing through.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.836
Well, I think that's for the best.

32:54.440 --> 32:58.115
- Sing another.
- Was sollen wir singen?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.196
"Ave Maris Stella".

33:02.680 --> 33:09.438
# Ave Maris Stella

33:09.560 --> 33:14.236
# Dei mater alma

33:14.360 --> 33:20.435
# Atque semper virgo

33:20.560 --> 33:24.678
# Felix coeli porta

33:24.800 --> 33:29.874
# Amen

33:30.760 --> 33:32.591
That's one you have to teach me.

33:32.720 --> 33:36.508
- Now you sing.
- All right.

33:38.520 --> 33:42.229
- What do you want to hear?
- We know Kirchen song only.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.511
- Just sing, ja?
- All right.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.391
# Frankie and Johnny were lovers

33:49.920 --> 33:53.595
# Oh, Lordy, how they... could...

33:57.960 --> 34:00.155
Erase that one.

34:00.280 --> 34:05.718
Tell you what. I'll sing one of them
down home, go-to-meeting songs

34:05.840 --> 34:07.956
and you join in with me, all right?

34:08.080 --> 34:11.197
- All you have to sing is "Amen."
- Amen.

34:11.320 --> 34:12.992
Nicht ah-men. Ay-men.

34:13.120 --> 34:17.636
- Ay-men?
- Right. OK. Here we go.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.831
# Amen

34:20.960 --> 34:23.793
# Amen

34:23.920 --> 34:25.911
# Amen

34:26.040 --> 34:31.034
# Amen, amen...
Now come on.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.592
# Amen

34:34.719 --> 34:37.632
# Amen

34:37.760 --> 34:39.909
# Amen

34:40.040 --> 34:43.918
# Amen, amen,
Sing it over

34:44.040 --> 34:46.873
# Amen

34:47.000 --> 34:49.797
# Amen

34:49.920 --> 34:52.150
# Amen

34:52.280 --> 34:56.034

# Amen, amen, amen

- # Amen

# Amen, amen

36:45.800 --> 36:49.713
# Amen

36:54.360 --> 36:55.793
Schmidt!

36:57.120 --> 36:59.395
Two times I call you for breakfast!

36:59.520 --> 37:02.432
I heard you. You can keep
the cup of milk and the one egg.

37:02.560 --> 37:06.314
You sucker me into breakfast, I'm
obliged to work. Not me. I'm cutting out.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.998
Was?

37:08.120 --> 37:11.795
This little soul is leaving the roost.
I'm heading thatta way.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.036
- Thatta way?
- I'm leaving.

37:15.680 --> 37:18.240
Schwester Gertrude, schnell!

37:18.360 --> 37:21.796
Hurry up! Schmidt will
take us to Northfolk!

37:23.600 --> 37:25.909
- You take us to Northfolk.
- You got bus fare?

37:26.040 --> 37:28.679
- Back?
- We'll get back. Don't worry about us.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.392
Amen!

38:05.200 --> 38:10.228
Well... it's been interesting.
Not profitable, but interesting.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.635
Schmidt, where do you go?

38:15.000 --> 38:17.434
I don't know. West?

38:17.560 --> 38:20.393
LA, San Francisco.
Maybe I'll swing on up to...

38:25.240 --> 38:27.356
So... goodbye.

38:28.120 --> 38:31.908
- Schwester Gertrude.
- Leben Sie wohl.

39:17.280 --> 39:19.077
Hey, boy.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.876
Are you Schmidt?

39:23.960 --> 39:27.111
Well, that's what they call me.
My name is Homer Smith.

39:27.240 --> 39:31.028
Are you the fellow who's supposed
to build a chapel? They must be kidding.

39:33.720 --> 39:37.269
- Why?
- They tell me you're their contractor.

39:37.400 --> 39:40.198
- So?
- Are you a contractor?

39:41.600 --> 39:45.991
- What's wrong with that?
- Well, what kind of contractor?

39:48.160 --> 39:49.434
Independent.

39:49.560 --> 39:52.279
You local?
I don't remember doing business before.

39:52.400 --> 39:56.791
- I'm out of State.
- How did they get mixed up with you?

39:56.920 --> 40:00.117
- How did they talk you into it?
- Nobody talked me into anything.

40:00.240 --> 40:03.073
They conned me out of some adobe brick
and some lumber.

40:03.200 --> 40:08.069
I figured I could write that off, but
if you're their contractor, like you say,

40:08.200 --> 40:11.875
tell her to take her business someplace
else. My terms are strictly cash.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.310
- You understand, boy?
- I understand. Hey, boy!

40:20.440 --> 40:22.795
- You need a good man?
- A good man.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.388
- I can give you two days a week.
- Doing what?

40:25.520 --> 40:28.637
- Moving earth. Those.
- You got any experience?

40:28.760 --> 40:31.228
I can handle any earth-moving
equipment you've got.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.669
What are you gonna be doing
the rest of the time?

40:33.800 --> 40:37.952
What have we been talking about?
I'm gonna build me a chapel.

40:41.240 --> 40:45.711
OK, contractor. I'll pay you the going rate
for labour on the job you're assigned.

40:45.840 --> 40:50.675
Seven o'clock, Thursday morning. But if
you're snowing me, you'll be out at 7.15.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.477
Just a second.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.110
- Goodbye, Schmidt.
- Get in the car.

41:05.240 --> 41:09.199
- We go to the bus stop.
- Don't be cute.

41:09.320 --> 41:12.118
I don't want him to think
we're having a fuss.

41:12.240 --> 41:14.196
- Fuss?
- Yes. Fuss.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.595
You don't fuss with your contractor.

41:30.160 --> 41:32.116
We can do it, Schmidt.

41:33.360 --> 41:38.878
There are three ingredients to a job
like this. First, you need a plan. Check?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.070
Two, you need labour.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.156
But, three, you need materials.

41:44.960 --> 41:49.431
That's for openers. You're gonna need 10,
20, 30, 40 times as many bricks as that.

41:50.920 --> 41:52.876
Can you get them?

41:54.920 --> 41:56.478
Ja!

42:00.240 --> 42:01.673
OK.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.634
OK. Let's get to work.

42:35.000 --> 42:36.592
You still listening, Lord,

42:36.720 --> 42:40.554
would you mind putting
a little meat on the table? Please?

42:56.840 --> 42:59.274
The work goes well.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.834
The problem is money.

43:03.040 --> 43:06.635
I request to your organisation...

43:07.960 --> 43:11.316
which is renowned for its...

43:12.440 --> 43:14.829
- Philanthropics.
- Was?

43:14.960 --> 43:16.439
Philanthropics.

43:16.560 --> 43:20.473
- Was machen Sie da, Schwester?
- Das Mittagessen für Herr Schmidt.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.154
Lesen Sie mir das Ganze noch mal vor.

43:24.280 --> 43:30.037
"The Maximillian Fund,
sieben elf, Fünf Avenue, New York City.

43:30.160 --> 43:33.391
"Highly honoured
and respected gentlemen,

43:33.520 --> 43:37.877
permit me to an appeal
for financing assistance... "

43:38.000 --> 43:40.355
No. Wait. A better word.

43:47.480 --> 43:48.993
Dollars!

44:30.360 --> 44:31.793
- The Lions.
- Ja.

44:31.920 --> 44:33.512
- The Elks.
- Ja.

44:33.640 --> 44:36.791
- The Order of Moose.
- Ja.

44:36.920 --> 44:40.629
Kiwanis. What kind of animal is that?

44:40.760 --> 44:42.512
Americans.

44:47.400 --> 44:52.554
Schmidt! You make knocking.
Like I told you.

44:53.840 --> 44:57.594
- We saved for you supper.
- No more bread and milk.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.517
A nice potato soup.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.996
Oh, and that'll make me
nice and fat and strong?

45:03.120 --> 45:05.190
- Ja.
- And you love me fat and strong!

45:05.320 --> 45:07.356
Ja.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.556
Oh, Schnuller!

45:14.840 --> 45:17.400
Hey, hey. You like that.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.757
What now?

45:37.880 --> 45:40.314
Look your hands. Dirty!

45:40.440 --> 45:43.591
Go wash your dirty hands and face.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.034
OK, I will.

45:50.160 --> 45:53.948
Then I come and give for you
the English lesson. Nein? Ja!

45:54.080 --> 45:55.991
Ja!

45:58.280 --> 46:00.635
Danke dir Gott, für diesen Segen.

46:02.480 --> 46:05.074
Ah, how about thanking me too, eh?

46:06.120 --> 46:10.033
No. I thank Him.
You, you couldn't help yourself.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.952
Oh, boy.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.158
# Wrapped in the manger

46:16.280 --> 46:19.317
- # Amen
- # On Christmas morning

46:19.440 --> 46:25.356
- # Amen, amen, amen
- # See him in the temple

46:25.480 --> 46:28.358
- # Amen
- # Talking with the elders

46:28.480 --> 46:31.358
- # Amen
- # Who marvel at his wisdom

46:31.480 --> 46:37.396
- # Amen, amen, amen
- # Down at the Jordan

46:37.520 --> 46:40.512
- # Amen
- # Where John was baptising

46:40.640 --> 46:43.518
- # Amen
- # And saving all the sinners

46:43.640 --> 46:48.873
# Amen, amen, amen...

47:19.560 --> 47:21.790
- Come with us, Schmidt.
- No, ma'am.

47:21.920 --> 47:24.673
- I'm gonna go feed my Baptist stomach.
- Come.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.430
Good people of Piedras,

47:39.560 --> 47:43.519
you have seen this man
who brings us now to the mass,

47:43.640 --> 47:47.428
but you did not know who he was,
what he was.

47:47.560 --> 47:50.916
I tell you now.
His name is Homer Schmidt.

47:51.040 --> 47:57.639
He is not of our faith,
but he was sent to us by our God,

47:57.760 --> 48:00.593
who is the God of all faiths.

48:00.720 --> 48:04.395
He is building us a chapel.

48:07.640 --> 48:12.714
It is true! And so we will
all see it. A miracle!

49:03.800 --> 49:05.836
Hey, Mother!

49:12.120 --> 49:15.556
- I laid my last brick.
- A good start.

49:15.680 --> 49:18.877
- And I ran out of board.
- Everything works out.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.913
- I'm ready to keep going but...
- Everything works out.

49:23.040 --> 49:24.951
Yeah, you said that.

49:25.080 --> 49:29.312
- Tomorrow you for Ashton work?
- Tomorrow and the next day. Why?

49:29.440 --> 49:31.749
Then we see.

49:32.800 --> 49:37.510
- Look, we had a bargain. I kept my end...
- Everything works out. It's God's will.

49:37.640 --> 49:41.315
- That we get brick or that we don't?
- Whatever.

49:41.440 --> 49:44.671
You would have made a great lawyer,
you know that?

50:50.280 --> 50:52.236
Bobkin.

50:53.360 --> 50:55.112
Sherman.

50:56.160 --> 50:58.116
Good night.

50:59.240 --> 51:01.037
Smith.

51:01.160 --> 51:06.075
- Tell me, how's the contracting business?
- It's all right.

51:06.200 --> 51:09.795
Just out of curiosity,
what are you using for materials?

51:11.080 --> 51:13.548
We're expecting a new shipment.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.715
No bricks?

52:05.760 --> 52:08.558
Why do you buy things to eat
we do not need?

52:08.680 --> 52:10.989
Now just a minute.

52:11.120 --> 52:13.076
You are very large on religion

52:13.200 --> 52:15.668
but you don't know
how to accept a gift from somebody

52:15.800 --> 52:19.270
without making them feel small.
Small! You follow?

52:19.400 --> 52:22.039
Poor man. His feelings is hurt!

52:22.160 --> 52:26.870
I'm not twisting your arm for any big
thank-yous, but I'm through feeling small.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.117
I got all the patience in the world!

52:30.720 --> 52:34.508
Then why do you work on the road gang
when you should build the chapel?

52:34.640 --> 52:36.596
Where are the bricks?

52:37.920 --> 52:43.472
They will come. Maybe not tonight, but
there is other things you could be busy.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.429
Raking and planting trees.

52:46.560 --> 52:49.393
We had this contract.
You failed to keep your part.

52:50.600 --> 52:54.639
I failed because I put my faith in people
instead of in God!

52:54.760 --> 52:57.991
Forget it.
It was an invisible contract anyway.

52:58.120 --> 53:02.238
- I don't believe you any more.
- Who are you not to believe me?

53:02.360 --> 53:06.831
Hm?! Somebody
passing through thatta way?

53:06.960 --> 53:10.919
Me, I come 8,000 miles to this place.

53:11.040 --> 53:14.953
You cry about a few bricks
which are not here when you want them!

53:15.080 --> 53:18.436
Do you know what we went through
to get to this place?

53:19.680 --> 53:22.035
You will not
stand in the way of this chapel.

53:22.640 --> 53:26.110
No. It will be done.

53:26.720 --> 53:29.439
Well, good luck, Charlie,
and you deal me out.

53:30.280 --> 53:32.191
Yeah. That stuff you wear,

53:32.320 --> 53:35.039
you think it's a uniform
that makes you some kind of cop,

53:35.160 --> 53:38.277
laying down the law,
throwing your weight around.

53:38.400 --> 53:43.679
You sound like one of them
old war movies. A regular Hitler!

53:48.720 --> 53:52.679
Well, you get yourself another boy.

54:31.200 --> 54:35.478
Mutter Maria! Hat der Schmidt
seinen Hammer daeglassen?

54:35.600 --> 54:39.195
Nein! He left nothing. Nothing!

54:39.320 --> 54:41.356
Das haben wir nötig gehabt.

54:41.480 --> 54:45.792
Zuerst beten wir für ihn, dann kommt er
und dann shickt sie ihn weg.

54:53.280 --> 54:55.236
Nothing.

55:49.080 --> 55:52.117
- You haven't heard anything from Smith?
- Nein. Nothing.

55:52.240 --> 55:55.676
- It's been three weeks.
- We thought at least he write postcard...

55:55.800 --> 55:58.997
Schweigen Sie, Schwester.
He will return.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.999
You're sure of that? Well, I wouldn't
get too upset about it, ma'am.

56:03.120 --> 56:06.430
He's shiftless and irresponsible,
you know the type?

56:06.560 --> 56:10.235
If he should come back,
tell him I'll hold his job open for a while.

56:10.360 --> 56:13.272
He's a pretty good man with a bulldozer.

58:08.920 --> 58:11.593
Smile at the people.

58:14.520 --> 58:16.875
But don't say anything.

58:19.520 --> 58:21.476
Go get your breakfast.

58:28.080 --> 58:30.036
Good morning.

58:31.240 --> 58:33.196
Good morning.

58:34.240 --> 58:36.390
Such a beautiful morning.

58:51.320 --> 58:54.949
Business Sunday morning
seems to have gotten better since I left.

58:55.080 --> 58:57.594
A question. Why?

58:57.720 --> 59:00.678
- Why did I take off?
- No. Why you come back?

59:03.280 --> 59:05.953
What's it to you?

59:10.360 --> 59:13.875
Sí. Sí. Sí. Gracias.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.912
- Now you have done it.
- Hm?

59:17.040 --> 59:21.591
That was a messenger. They
want to know if you are back to stay.

59:21.720 --> 59:26.919
I have told them yes. I make them happy.
Now you have the big breakfast, eh?

59:27.560 --> 59:30.120
What will it be?

59:32.000 --> 59:33.956
A coke.

59:37.760 --> 59:41.719
"Wash yourself, Schmidt.
Vash away ze stink."

59:46.040 --> 59:51.512
Why didn't they ask me to build
a bath tub with nice hot water?

59:52.920 --> 59:56.595
That'd make more sense.
"Wash yourself, Schmidt."

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.709
That's the first kind word I've had
since I got back.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.635
What bugs me, she was so positive
I was coming back.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.516
You wouldn't happen to have
a nice cold can of beer on you?

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.916
I must be out of my skull coming back.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.672
Schmidt!

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:33.276
Schmidt!

01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:46.358
Schmidt, look, all these bricks!
Isn't it glorious?

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.192
Gracias.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.996
Faulpelz. Lassen Sie doch die...

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:59.157
- Don't work them by themselves.
- This isn't enough.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.669
- All right.
- All right? What?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.756
We pray some more!

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.152
- We have come to help you.
- Thanks.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.237
I thank you very much,
but I don't need any help, thank you.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.675
You are sure
you are doing the right thing?

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.876
You prayed up a lot of bricks, Mama,

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.197
but you only prayed for one man
to build your chapel.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.789
Hey, amigo. I had to come see
the one-man cathedral.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:42.393
This is all you have done in one week?
God made the whole world in that time.

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:44.829
And he was able to rest.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.954
Hey. Notice your audience.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:55.072
- I can't get rid of 'em.
- They heard it was the best show in town!

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:28.792
Está bien para un americano.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.554
Move your foot off my adobe.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.029
Where would you like us to bury you?
Under the altar?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.116
Move your foot off my adobe.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:05.910
You do not want it? Do not take it.
Step over it and go get another one.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.070
A piece of pie?

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.038
I'm not hungry.

01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:54.879
Was ist los mit dem? Was ist?

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.869
I wanted to build it myself.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.356
Those people help you and all is well.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.871
I don't want any help.
I wanted to build it myself.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.992
That way it would be built
slowly and carefully.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.715
So now it's fast and it's ready the sooner.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.796
The Archbishop...

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.711
If he is busy, he will not come
but I think we should invite him.

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.513
Look...

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.872
You see, all my life,
I wanted to really build something.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:37.913
Maybe if I had had an education I would
have been an architect or an engineer -

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.431
throw the Golden Gate Bridge
across San Francisco Bay.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.950
And even maybe
build a rocket ship to Venus.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.715
I'm not getting through to you.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:58.994
Well, the chapel is being built
and that's all that matters.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.399
I wanted to build it myself.

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.869
God is building out there the chapel

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.788
and you sit here feeling sorry for yourself
because you are not Him?

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.233
Ah.

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.189
He did not finish den Kaffee.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.194
You build the walls too high.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.189
Die Mauern. Die Mauern... zu hoch.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:56.189
Der Balken - nicht dort, da anfangen.
Verstehen Sie mich?

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:58.470
Necesitamos para el marco de la ventana.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.955
Es ist ja ganz egal, was Sie sagen.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.551
Es ist kein Platz für den Beichtstuhl
und das Weihwasser vorgesehen.

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.470
Mother Maria, no comprende
sus instrucionnes.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.636
Das ist nicht richtig. Verstehen Sie?

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.596
Aber das ist nicht richtig.
Verstehen Sie?

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.273
Deswegen hat die Mutter Maria gesagt,
wir müssen...

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:43.469
Ah, Francesco.
Der Wanden is for support. The wall.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.350
Madre mia! What am I doing here?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.112
Amigo!

01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:02.792
Everybody. Everybody! Everybody!

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.434
It is wrong... was ihr macht.

01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.713
Eine Kirche is for Beten. Beten.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.391
Look, you promised them a chapel,
now they will have nothing. Nada.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:17.318
...with practically application.

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:21.115
So... Oh, do not stop now.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.998
OK, OK. I thought you was loco.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.998
I was wrong. You was right.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:33.556
See, I have the big humility, amigo.
How about you?

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.875
The walls are high too much.

01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.915
The padre was right.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:48.431
You quit, they go home,
the walls fall down,

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.755
the rain, she melts the bricks,

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:54.031
the wind, she blows away the dust.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.391
They will be back
getting their spiritual comfort

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.080
from the back end of a pie wagon.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.079
Come!
Please come back like it was.

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.910
Everyone working together
and laughing and singing!

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.395
And that's the way how it should be!

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.749
Hold it!

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:18.836
Everything is cockeyed.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.111
That beam - Mario, Pedro -
it belongs there.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:26.313
Here's the way it goes. That beam
sits on a joist and it supports the roof.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.874
- You got it?
- Sí.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.389
And the walls are not high enough.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.559
- Jesus, we need more adobe all around.
- Sí, señor.

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.750
- Some boss, eh?
- Sí.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.871
A job needs a boss
who knows what he's doing.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.037
I'm no boss, but I just know
how I want my chapel built.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.233
Felipe, once we get that beam in place,
we're gonna pitch the roof, yeah?

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.750
- Like this. You follow?
- El boss!

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:58.436
All right. Vamanos.
Let's get this show on the road.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.836
Let's go. Girls, these men
are gonna need food - lots of it.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.589
So start squeezing that cow
and buttering up those sandwiches.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.995
More adobe in here! Let's go!

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.076
You too, Mama. Macht schnell!

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.156
A Hitler.

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.633
Adobe.

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.513
This was made for ten thousand years.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:59.029
- Feel good!
- Ja!

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.435
- Boss wants more adobe.
- Ja.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.516
Where is the boss?

01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.397
Hey, put another man on this beam!
Miguel!

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:28.239
I need you topside to tie off this truss.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.159
Easy does it. Hold it there.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.236
Hold it there.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.512
Oh, hello... Get up there and tie off
that side. He'll be up in a second.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.996
- I heard about this in town.
- Yeah, you did?

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:50.476
- Juan, think the barbecue's ready?
- Oh, sí. Sí, señor.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.672
- Let them tie off this, then call lunch.
- OK, boss.

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.756
Some boss!

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.872
Muchachos! Lunch! Lunch!

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.756
Lunch! Lunch!

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.958
Say, where'd you get all the materials?

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.152
- The people give them, señor.
- What for?

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:21.430
A man he gives wood, bricks.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.994
This time, what does he get? A chapel.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.112
A place where his children
can receive the sacraments.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.959
For their children to have faith,
it is important.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.119
- Is that why you're here?
- To me, it is insurance.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.109
To me, life is here on this earth. I cannot
see further so I cannot believe further.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:44.519
But if they are right about the hereafter,
I have paid my insurance, señor.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.155
Hey, boss!

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.354
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Well, I'm kind of short-handed.

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:00.436
Getting good labour is always a problem.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.710
Oh, really?

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.070
Er, I've got a new freeway deal.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.680
Sorry, Mr Ashton,
but I've got a church contract.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.951
Well, when you're finished,
I could use a foreman, Mr Smith.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:20.153
Thanks, Mr Ashton. But when
I'm finished here, I'll be moving on.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.032
- But thanks.
- Señor Homer?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.032
Oh.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:32.709
Well, we're gonna have to find
a very special place to put that!

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.796
Thank you. Thank you.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.794
You'd better take this to Mother Maria.

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.716
Everybody wants to give.

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.628
Hey, mister. Mister.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.479
Today we raise the roof.
We have fiesta. You come?

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.319
Oh. No. No, thanks.

01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.238
I've got something I have to do,
but thanks.

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.112
De nada. Adios.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.951
"Und Gott war das Wort... "

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:06.792
Dieser verrückte Schmidt
und seine verrückten Freunde.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:09.388
Perdónelos, madre,
que todos son unos borrachos.

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.637
They build a house, a barn,
there's always a fiesta.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.718
Fiesta! In my chapel!

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.074
Gringo man!

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.870
Gringo! I don't know
if that's a step up or a step down

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.719
from somethin' else
I've been called all my life!

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:51.115
- Well, you are awake?
- I guess so.

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.673
Good.

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.152
Why'd you do that?

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.238
The women last night
say that is the only thing

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.830
when a man has been mixing wine
with tequila.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.394
I'm gonna mix you... With tequila!

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.359
Por favor, shut that thing off!

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.950
Morning! I've brought
something over for your chapel.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.037
They're seconds but I figured
you could use them somewhere.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.470
- They were taking up space at the yard.
- What do you think?

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.751
We could crush 'em.
Use them for gravel for the wall.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:42.795
But those are worth... I mean...
Well, they've been fired good and strong.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.513
- Thanks.
- Mr Ashton!

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.392
Mr Ashton!

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.118
I should have sent those bricks over
anonymously.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:19:01.031
He's very generous - he sees we're
building with adobe, he gives us bricks.

01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.118
They're very expensive.
I wonder what made him do it.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.708
- Insurance.
- What?

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.592
Forget it.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.395
Mr Ashton, we need bricks,
we need lumber,

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:18.149
we need shingles and plenty of cement.

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.794
Because we will build a school
and a hospital.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.879
And we need beams please, Mr Ashton.
Do you understand?

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.116
Hey, Smith.

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:43.712
You and getting everybody involved.
You've been making a lot of mischief.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.910
- What's the matter?
- She's really after me.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:50.079
- But the chapel's almost finished.
- Oh, no. She's just beginning.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.509
Next she'll want a school, then a hospital

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:54.790
and only God knows - and she -
what comes next.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.835
Only so much is deductible.
She's gonna be on my back from now on!

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.916
That sweet old lady?

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:14.714
- Señor Boss, can I help you?
- No, gracias. This part is mine.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.796
This part is mine.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:22.388
Señor Smith? Will it have bells?

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.476
Sure. Some day.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:28.233
So...

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.832
So.

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:34.269
Tomorrow, the first masses.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.991
See...

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.350
Seat in the front. You.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.675
Where all the people can see you.

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.830
And every one of these bricks
over the door I put in myself.

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:04.431
A real church for you to say the mass.
Es verdad, padre?

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.957
There is so much to do. So much to do.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.715
Tomorrow from Northfolk
the town choir is coming.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:39.312
The boys and girls. Such beautiful voices
you never have heard.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.271
Forgive me.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.472
They will stand over there
and up there flowers.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:49.798
On both sides of the altar, flowers.
Nothing but flowers.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.480
I have much to do. Much to do.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.913
Many years ago, I made
a very vain and selfish prayer.

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:03.436
Now He has answered my prayer
through you, through many people.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.638
I... I pray now I become worthy
of His trust and yours.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:15.029
I have so much to do. So much to do.

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:44.355
# Ave Maris Stella

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.191
# Dei Mater alma

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:55.509
# Atque semper virgo

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.838
# Felix coeli porta

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:04.988
# Amen

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.193
Do you feel all right?

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.680
- Tonight you not smile, Herr Schmidt.
- Come on, smile.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.837
This is like the first night you come, ja?

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.948
- Schmidt!
- Nothing's changed.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.433
Schmidt.

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:31.756
You did not fasten the pews to the floor...

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.235
It's done.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:37.557
You must oil the doors
so they will not squeak in the mass.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.875
It's done.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.118
- But the rail of the altar you did not fix.
- Everything is done.

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:01.197
- Ja?
- Ja.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.438
Then it is all finished.

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.034
It's all finished.
I done builded you a "shapel".

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.878
You built me a... cha-pel.

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.949
Correction. S-ank you.

01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:27.200
Correction. Th-ank you...

01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:33.348
That's very nice.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.398
Well, it's English lesson time.

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.909
- I built a chapel.
- I built a chapel.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:50.350
- You built a chapel.
- You built a chapel.

01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:54.234
- Oh, we built a chapel.
- We built a chapel.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.397
He built the chapel.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.638

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.988
