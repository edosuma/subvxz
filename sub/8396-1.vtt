Nothing? 
 No, ma'am.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.734
Her oxygen ran out two minutes ago.

00:34.734 --> 00:36.534
John said she's here, so she's here.

01:41.054 --> 01:43.334
Oh, Henry.

01:43.334 --> 01:46.494
You're going to
fall, Henry. Oh, God.

01:46.494 --> 01:48.334
Please.

01:48.334 --> 01:53.574
Where is Mia? Where is she?

02:02.574 --> 02:04.294
Nothing.

02:09.494 --> 02:11.454
Where is she, where
is she? Living room.

02:11.454 --> 02:15.614
For God's sake, there's a
panel behind the plasterboard.

02:15.614 --> 02:17.134
Please.

02:17.134 --> 02:18.654
John?

02:18.654 --> 02:23.534
'Living room, there's a panel in the plasterboard.'
Living room. Living room, come on! Living room!

02:23.534 --> 02:26.134
Help me with this.

02:27.974 --> 02:31.054
Please, I'm going to fall, I'm
going to fall. What if you're lying?

02:31.054 --> 02:37.254
What if you are lying, because you've done that
before, haven't you? You've lied. And lied and lied.

02:37.254 --> 02:39.694
I'm not lying, I swear. She's there.

02:41.894 --> 02:43.934
Please.

02:45.654 --> 02:47.294
John, she's here.

02:47.294 --> 02:49.614
Is she alive? I can't tell yet.

02:50.334 --> 02:52.734
Come on, oh come on, please.

02:55.254 --> 02:57.014
Please!

02:57.814 --> 02:59.574
Please!

03:02.534 --> 03:04.654
SHE COUGHS

03:04.654 --> 03:06.454
Good girl. Good girl.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.774
We've got her. Oh, thank God.

03:09.774 --> 03:11.294
Get me up, please.

03:11.294 --> 03:12.974
Thank God.

03:12.974 --> 03:15.614
Please, please.

03:15.614 --> 03:18.894
PLEASE!

03:18.894 --> 03:20.214
Well done, you're all right now.

03:20.214 --> 03:23.374
Henry, tell me about
the others. Please!

03:23.374 --> 03:25.814
How many more were there?
 None.

03:25.814 --> 03:29.694
Henry, can you tell me how many
more were there? How many were there?

03:29.694 --> 03:33.734
Because there was Adrian, and
there was little Gabriella,

03:33.734 --> 03:35.334
and of course there was Emma.

03:36.294 --> 03:42.174
Emma. I dug Emma out
with my own hands.

03:44.534 --> 03:47.614
But it was too late.

03:47.614 --> 03:49.534
Please, please.

03:49.534 --> 03:52.094
Please,

03:52.094 --> 03:53.774

04:51.214 --> 04:58.374
# Look at her with
her eyes like a flame

04:58.374 --> 05:02.654
# She will love you like a fly

05:02.654 --> 05:07.374
# Will never love you again. #

07:54.734 --> 07:57.014
This is where you spend
your gardening leave, is it?

07:57.014 --> 08:00.094
Staring down a big hole.

08:00.094 --> 08:02.974
We have the Madsen verdict.

08:02.974 --> 08:08.614
Given the exceptional circumstances, the inquiry
have found no grounds for disciplinary action.

08:10.134 --> 08:12.334
Which means you're back.

08:12.334 --> 08:14.454
If you want it.

08:15.854 --> 08:17.614
I want it.

08:17.614 --> 08:21.254
Rule number one, don't get
yourself into this situation again.

08:21.254 --> 08:24.494
Which means you observe
case management protocol.

08:24.494 --> 08:28.814
Any pro-active strategies are to be signed
off by me. I don't sign, they don't happen.

08:28.814 --> 08:30.854
Is that the speech?
That's the speech.

08:30.854 --> 08:34.854
It's a good speech. Thank you.
It's one I prepared earlier.

08:34.854 --> 08:36.494
You and Zoe, you spoken?

08:36.494 --> 08:40.453
No. Not for a while. And?
It was a trial separation.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.014
I tried it,

08:42.014 --> 08:44.134
didn't like it.

08:44.134 --> 08:46.014
She feel the same?

08:46.014 --> 08:49.894
Rose, I did everything she
asked for. Got myself together.

08:49.894 --> 08:51.414
So, now we'll see.

08:51.414 --> 08:53.414
Well, that's the difference
between her and me.

08:53.414 --> 08:57.494
She talks about taking
you back, I actually do it.

08:57.494 --> 09:00.814
DCI John Luther, DS Justin Ripley.

09:00.814 --> 09:02.534
Morning, sir. Nice to meet you.

09:02.534 --> 09:06.934
Welcome back and...whatever.

09:09.214 --> 09:11.574
Yes, shall we? All right.

09:13.974 --> 09:16.054
So, do we need to have the chat?

09:16.054 --> 09:22.534
What chat? I was sick, I got
better, I'm back, etc. Er, then, no.

09:22.534 --> 09:24.734
We don't need the chat. Good.

09:24.734 --> 09:27.014
I've lobbied to be
stationed with you.

09:27.014 --> 09:28.774
I put in the request
nine months ago.

09:28.774 --> 09:31.134
Chased it up three
times a week in writing.

09:34.334 --> 09:37.374
So, what we got? Er, home invasion.

09:37.374 --> 09:41.374
Murder. Victims are Douglas and
Laura Morgan. Who called it in?

09:41.374 --> 09:42.934
The daughter, Alice Morgan.

09:42.934 --> 09:44.774
She was out when it happened. Doing?

09:44.774 --> 09:46.614
Buying bread and milk.

09:46.614 --> 09:50.414
She live there? No, she's a research
fellow for some Department of Physics.

09:50.414 --> 09:53.454
She lives in a flat near
campus. Why the family gathering?

09:53.454 --> 09:55.414
Douglas Morgan's birthday.

09:55.414 --> 09:56.694
Right, let's go.

10:11.174 --> 10:12.214
Sir.

10:21.294 --> 10:24.454
Our first responders have
this down as point of entry.

10:24.454 --> 10:26.854
The daughter left it
unlocked when she went out.

10:26.854 --> 10:30.254
We need to look for indication that
the shooter was watching the house.

10:30.254 --> 10:35.054
Possible vantage points, hiding
places. Good line of sight.

10:35.054 --> 10:38.334
You might want to keep
your hands in your pockets.

10:38.334 --> 10:40.614
Reduces temptation
to touch anything.

10:42.214 --> 10:44.454
Sleeping pills,

10:44.454 --> 10:47.174
separate bedrooms.
What does that tell you?

10:47.174 --> 10:49.454
Husband snored?

10:49.454 --> 10:52.214
Anything else?

10:52.214 --> 10:55.534
Hard to say. Sometimes separate
beds make for a happy marriage.

10:55.534 --> 10:58.134
That's a very generous thought.

11:00.774 --> 11:03.454
It's good.

11:07.374 --> 11:09.014
He didn't hear it coming.

11:10.694 --> 11:12.734
He's a published poet, small press.

11:12.734 --> 11:17.734
So, no sign of burglary. No attempt to
stage a scene, and no sexual assault.

11:17.734 --> 11:20.334
Contract killing, maybe?
Well, it's workable.

11:20.334 --> 11:22.094
I mean, the shooter
has done his homework.

11:22.094 --> 11:26.174
He knows the layout of the place. He
eliminates any physical threat, the dog.

11:26.174 --> 11:27.814
Douglas, what kind of weapon was it?

11:27.814 --> 11:29.894
Some kind of low-calibre handgun.

11:29.894 --> 11:32.054
Some kind? No gun? They
are still searching.

11:32.054 --> 11:34.134
House, grounds,
drains. Nothing so far.

11:34.134 --> 11:38.414
Yes, see, someone that efficient, you would
expect him to ditch the gun at the scene.

11:38.414 --> 11:41.414
Am I missing something?
Does that seem right to you?

11:41.414 --> 11:45.294
None of it seems right to me.
Because it's not right, is it?

11:47.054 --> 11:48.094
It's not right.

11:50.974 --> 11:52.734
I'll meet you upstairs,
yeah? Yeah, sure.

inquiry come down on my side.

Oh, John. That's really good news, that's great.
I mean, I knew they would, obviously. But...

12:17.654 --> 12:21.094
Yeah, and I'm back
at work. 'Already?'

12:21.094 --> 12:23.894

12:31.294 --> 12:35.854
That's why I was calling, really. I think
that we, well we need to have that talk.

12:37.814 --> 12:41.454

12:42.454 --> 12:49.454
OK, tonight. Look, I'm sorry, I really
do have to go. Um... So... 'What?'

12:51.654 --> 12:54.134

be mad to work here, but it helps."

back with a weird one?

13:48.934 --> 13:51.374
Yeah, they did welcome
me back with a weird one.

13:54.974 --> 13:58.654
You? Honour killing. Ouch.

14:03.014 --> 14:04.734
So, how are you?

Splendid.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.094
Excellent, then. Good.

Miss Luther, I'm Mark
North. I remember, yes.

14:33.454 --> 14:34.894
Did you tell him?

14:37.134 --> 14:39.254
Zoe, he needs to know.

14:41.014 --> 14:45.174
All this sneaking around, it's mad.
You've been separated for months.

14:45.174 --> 14:48.814
He's the only one that doesn't seem to
know. I know, I know, I know, I know.

14:48.814 --> 14:50.934
I wasn't going to
tell him when he was...

14:50.934 --> 14:52.854
you know, getting better.

14:54.654 --> 14:57.934
Now I wake up, I feel sick. I've got
this permanent knot in my stomach.

15:00.134 --> 15:02.334
It's going to kill him.
You can't keep lying.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.054
It's cruel.

15:18.814 --> 15:22.094
Miss Morgan? Alice, please.

15:22.094 --> 15:24.734
Alice. Hello, I'm John Luther.

15:24.734 --> 15:26.574
Senior investigating officer. Can I?

15:29.494 --> 15:31.014
You must be very tired.

15:32.694 --> 15:36.294
Yes. I am.

15:38.654 --> 15:40.654
I don't think I've
ever been this tired.

15:40.654 --> 15:43.014
It's shock.

15:43.014 --> 15:46.254
It's the way our body reacts,
it's one of those strange things.

15:48.334 --> 15:51.654
Alice, I know this has been a
terrible, terrible day for you.

15:51.654 --> 15:55.454
Things look bleak, and you
must be feeling very alone.

15:55.454 --> 16:01.494
But, believe me when I say we will do everything
we can to find out who did this. Thank you.

16:01.494 --> 16:05.294
So, these things I'm going to
ask you, I have to ask. I'm sorry.

16:05.294 --> 16:06.894
Let me turn this on.

16:10.814 --> 16:15.254
Do you have any idea who would
wish harm on your parents?

16:17.174 --> 16:19.414
Even if it's just a feeling,

16:19.414 --> 16:23.054
a sense of unease about someone.

16:23.054 --> 16:25.694
Something you heard
your mum or dad say.

16:25.694 --> 16:31.134
Something that didn't sit right. No.

16:31.134 --> 16:34.214
There's nothing, my mum
was a very kind, very...

16:36.054 --> 16:37.494
very gracious woman.

16:38.614 --> 16:40.414
Can I get you a glass of water?

16:40.414 --> 16:44.854
No, I'm sorry. I'll be OK. A cup of
tea? I'm just... It's OK, it's OK.

16:46.094 --> 16:47.174
And your dad?

16:53.454 --> 16:55.534
He was a very admirable man. Just...

16:57.974 --> 16:59.494
The thing is, Alice...

17:01.654 --> 17:04.773
this was a very singular crime.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.334
No sign of robbery.

17:08.854 --> 17:11.414
And no apparent, and I'm sorry,

17:11.414 --> 17:16.253
sexual motivation. Now, I've been a
police officer for a very long time,

17:16.253 --> 17:21.054
and one of the things that I've found
is that crimes like this aren't random.

17:21.054 --> 17:24.654
And never without motive.
So, as painful as this is,

17:24.654 --> 17:29.454
I'm going to ask you to
dig deep and really think...

17:29.454 --> 17:34.174
about any money issues your
parents may have been experiencing.

17:34.174 --> 17:36.214
Any marital difficulties.

17:36.214 --> 17:39.774
I've done nothing but think, all
I do is think. There is nothing.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.614
There's absolutely nothing.

17:48.894 --> 17:53.054
Guv. So, he's back?
From outer space.

17:53.054 --> 17:56.134
You do know the man
is nitroglycerine?

17:56.134 --> 18:01.774
With respect, sir, a comprehensive investigation
under your edict cleared him of any wrongdoing.

18:01.774 --> 18:04.574
Not least because the only
other witness is in a coma,

18:04.574 --> 18:06.454
measuring three on
the Glasgow scale.

18:06.454 --> 18:09.534
And Mia Dalton is in school
today, and not in the ground.

18:09.534 --> 18:14.934
Rose, if you bet too heavily on
Luther, then you stand or fall with him.

18:14.934 --> 18:19.094
And with you goes this unit, and
my credibility as its architect.

18:19.094 --> 18:25.014
Haven't you worked too hard for too long
to take that big a risk on such a wild card?

18:25.014 --> 18:28.294
I don't consider him a risk.
Then what is he? An investment.

18:28.294 --> 18:32.534
And if Henry Madsen wakes up and gives
his account of what happened that night...

18:32.534 --> 18:34.974
will Luther drag us all down?

18:34.974 --> 18:37.134
Let's hope not.

18:44.934 --> 18:47.494
So just one more time
so I'm absolutely clear.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.054
You saw nothing or anyone unusual?

18:51.054 --> 18:54.534
I'm sorry.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.014
I wish I could tell you I had.

19:00.254 --> 19:02.734
I've got this feeling, this...

19:02.734 --> 19:06.494
strange feeling like I'm looking at
it down the wrong end of a telescope.

19:08.174 --> 19:09.814
Like it happened years ago.

19:09.814 --> 19:12.014
That can happen with stress.

19:12.014 --> 19:14.534
Different parts of
the brain take over.

19:14.534 --> 19:17.174
We remember things
in different ways.

19:24.174 --> 19:26.534
HE YAWNS

19:29.174 --> 19:33.414
I'm so sorry, it's been a long day.

19:33.414 --> 19:35.214
Really, it's fine.

19:36.934 --> 19:40.134
It's very tiring going
round and round like this.

19:41.654 --> 19:43.174
You must be exhausted.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.614
Can I get you a coffee?

19:49.614 --> 19:51.134
Tea would be nice.

20:00.054 --> 20:05.054
She did it. She did
it. Look at this.

20:08.254 --> 20:09.774
I'm so sorry.

20:12.054 --> 20:14.414
It's been a long day.
Look, she didn't yawn.

20:14.414 --> 20:18.014
She didn't yawn. Someone in a room yawns,
you yawn. See, even talking about it.

20:18.014 --> 20:21.854
It's to do with the parts of
the brain that deal with empathy.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.774
She didn't yawn. She did it.

20:23.774 --> 20:26.694
And he's back. Nothing in her
affect points to survivor guilt.

20:26.694 --> 20:28.374
"Why them? Why not me?"

20:28.374 --> 20:30.254
That's pretty atypical.

20:30.254 --> 20:34.014
So her affect's off. It could be
medication, shock. Whatever. Except it's not.

20:34.014 --> 20:37.414
This kind of scenario, an offender
typically tries to stage the scene,

20:37.414 --> 20:40.214
make it look like murder,
suicide, a burglary gone wrong.

20:40.214 --> 20:42.774
But? She did none of
that. Exactly. Exactly how?

20:42.774 --> 20:45.574
Because she's proud of this!
Why give anyone else the credit?

20:45.574 --> 20:48.654
To alibi herself? She
doesn't care about alibis.

20:48.654 --> 20:54.094
She's a malignant narcissist, this is
about prestige, power, self-affirmation.

20:54.094 --> 20:55.614
The timeline doesn't work.

20:55.614 --> 20:59.894
Three minutes before she
called 999 she was at the shops.

20:59.894 --> 21:02.454
There's not enough time.
There's not enough anything.

21:02.454 --> 21:05.374
Absence is the point.

21:05.374 --> 21:07.894
It's a way of her saying
to us "look at me".

21:07.894 --> 21:10.454
So where's the gun?
It's got to be somewhere.

21:10.454 --> 21:12.214
Everything's
somewhere. I don't know.

21:12.214 --> 21:14.334
Say that again. That was special.

21:14.334 --> 21:16.334
I don't know where the gun is.

21:18.294 --> 21:23.014
No, she doesn't look the type. That's the thing
about people, they always find ways to surprise you.

21:25.014 --> 21:27.134
Tea.

21:33.014 --> 21:34.934
Is your chair OK?

21:34.934 --> 21:37.854
Comfy?

21:37.854 --> 21:42.374
It's fine, thank you. Only sometimes,
we like to shorten one of the legs.

21:42.374 --> 21:46.054
So the suspect can
never get comfortable.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.694
Never relax, always unbalanced.

21:48.694 --> 21:50.734
Is it too hot?

21:50.734 --> 21:54.774
Really. It's fine.

21:57.734 --> 22:03.454
'I see you got your
PhD at 18 years old.

22:03.454 --> 22:05.214
'Astrophysics, was it?'

22:05.214 --> 22:08.094
'Dark Matter Distribution
in Disc Galaxies.'

22:08.094 --> 22:09.934
'Dark Matter.

22:09.934 --> 22:12.054
That's the stuff that
makes up the universe.

22:12.054 --> 22:15.854
But it doesn't interact with the
things we know and in the way we expect.

22:15.854 --> 22:21.414
No, but its presence can be inferred from
gravitational effects on visible matter.

22:21.414 --> 22:22.974
We know it's there.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.254
BOTH: We just can't see it.

22:26.934 --> 22:30.694
Would many police officers be able to
gain my trust by having this conversation?

22:30.694 --> 22:33.214
I don't know, I just
like to read books.

22:33.214 --> 22:35.174
It beats burning them.

22:35.174 --> 22:38.454
No but you're the one
that's practically a genius.

22:38.454 --> 22:40.054
Only practically?

22:40.054 --> 22:41.614
See so you went to Oxford at what?

22:41.614 --> 22:43.374
Thirteen. Wow, that's young.

22:43.374 --> 22:49.734
These child prodigies, they're not one thing
or the other, they're sort of freaks really.

22:50.734 --> 22:53.294
But I expect your
parents were... proud.

22:53.294 --> 22:56.054
Very.

22:56.054 --> 22:58.054
There were newspaper articles.

22:58.054 --> 23:02.454
Pictures of mum, dad and
me, smiling in the library.

23:02.454 --> 23:06.294
When I was nine, I
proved tangent minus 1x.

23:06.294 --> 23:07.974
They bought me a dress.

23:07.974 --> 23:09.534
Got me on the news.

23:09.534 --> 23:16.894
I wonder what that was like? You know 13
years old, classmates were what? 20, 22?

23:16.894 --> 23:19.374
No friends your age.

23:19.374 --> 23:21.334
No boyfriends. Quite a presumption.

23:21.334 --> 23:23.694
Actually, I matured very early...

23:23.694 --> 23:25.254
sexually.

23:38.854 --> 23:42.454
Alice, are you familiar
with Ockham's Razor?

23:43.974 --> 23:47.414
"All things being equal, the simplest
solution is the best solution."

23:47.414 --> 23:48.974
That's right.

23:48.974 --> 23:52.774
And what that principle tells me is,
the only other person known to have been

23:52.774 --> 23:55.014
at your parents'
house this morning...

23:55.014 --> 23:57.014
it was you.

23:57.014 --> 24:00.694
I don't see how it's possible
to arrive at that conclusion.

24:00.694 --> 24:03.654
Well, there was no
evidence of an intruder.

24:03.654 --> 24:06.374
But absence of evidence,
isn't evidence of absence.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.454
I know. I'm making a leap.

24:08.454 --> 24:10.134
It's a little leap though.

24:10.134 --> 24:13.534
It's more of a hop. Is this where
you ask me if I hated my parents?

24:13.534 --> 24:15.054
It is about that time, yeah.

24:15.054 --> 24:19.134
Did they make me a freak? Yes.
Did I hate them? Absolutely.

24:19.134 --> 24:22.414
Did I kill them?

24:22.414 --> 24:25.574
No. Can you prove that?
I can't prove a negative.

24:25.574 --> 24:29.374
It can't be done. Innocence is a
negative. It's the absence of guilt.

24:29.374 --> 24:32.134
Meaning the burden of
proof is entirely yours.

24:32.134 --> 24:36.094
If you think I did this, then you
need to demonstrate how and when.

24:36.094 --> 24:38.174
I know, and I won't be
able to do that, will I?

24:38.174 --> 24:41.294
Well, you can certainly try.
Because there is nothing.

24:41.294 --> 24:44.694
You don't interact with the things
we know in the way that we expect.

24:44.694 --> 24:48.374
Your presence, your actions, can
only be inferred by a certain...

24:48.374 --> 24:51.094
absence. Is that a compliment?

24:51.094 --> 24:58.054
Absolutely. Ah, are you trying to
beguile me? No, I wouldn't be so foolish.

24:58.054 --> 25:02.574
But I will tell you this, Alice. You can revel
in your brilliance for as long as you like.

25:02.574 --> 25:04.214
But people slip up.

25:06.174 --> 25:07.694
Happens time and time again.

25:07.694 --> 25:11.134
Well, that's just faulty logic
postulated on imperfect data collection.

25:11.134 --> 25:15.294
What if you only catch
people who make mistakes?

25:15.294 --> 25:17.494
That would skew the
figures, wouldn't it?

25:21.974 --> 25:23.694
Yes, it would.

25:23.694 --> 25:26.454
But criminals aren't as
smart as they think they are.

25:26.454 --> 25:28.534
Oh, that must get monotonous.

25:28.534 --> 25:31.094
For someone as brilliant as you.

25:34.694 --> 25:37.414
Ian, am I wrong?
You're not wrong. No.

25:37.414 --> 25:41.294
Guv. There's got to be something
we can find to charge her with?

25:41.294 --> 25:43.814
Such as? Being a space oddity?

25:43.814 --> 25:45.334
Such as, she killed them.

25:45.334 --> 25:48.534
Right now, she's little girl
lost. We've got no real motive.

25:48.534 --> 25:51.094
She hated her parents.
Seriously, who doesn't?

25:51.094 --> 25:56.454
There's no forensics, no witnesses. Timeline alone
gets it laughed out the CPS. You saw her in there!

25:56.454 --> 26:00.654
It excites her that we know she did it. So
prove it. Bring me something of substance.

26:00.654 --> 26:03.294
Find me the gun, put it in her hand.

26:03.294 --> 26:06.414
Until then, cut her
loose and send her home.

26:13.734 --> 26:16.174
Thank you very much, Miss
Morgan, you're free to go.

26:23.494 --> 26:25.014
Well, I enjoyed our chat.

26:26.574 --> 26:28.094
You're very interesting.

27:58.654 --> 28:01.054
Wow! Nice dress!

28:02.854 --> 28:08.854
Just come from dinner. Come in.

28:19.534 --> 28:22.134
What's wrong? You look tired.

28:22.134 --> 28:25.654
Me? Oh, no I'm all
right. Why...what's wrong?

28:25.654 --> 28:28.934
John, I know... I know what
you came here to discuss.

28:28.934 --> 28:32.214
But before you say anything, you
need to know that I've met somebody.

28:32.214 --> 28:35.054
Sorry? I met someone.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.534
What do you mean? You met...

28:40.534 --> 28:42.134
someone, who?

28:42.134 --> 28:43.894
Someone.

28:52.414 --> 28:55.494
What do you mean, er, Zoe?

28:55.494 --> 28:57.654
When?

28:57.654 --> 29:02.134
A while ago. Who? It doesn't matter.

29:02.134 --> 29:03.414
It does matter.

29:07.694 --> 29:11.054
Are you sleeping with him?

29:25.414 --> 29:31.974
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

29:31.974 --> 29:34.654
Zoe, no, Zoe, no!

29:40.454 --> 29:43.894
Why would you do that?

29:43.894 --> 29:46.894
Why, Zoe come on, why?

29:46.894 --> 29:51.454
Hmm!? Go home, John.

29:52.134 --> 29:53.694
This is my home.

29:57.774 --> 29:59.094
No.

31:01.894 --> 31:03.534
Zoe called.

31:03.534 --> 31:05.014
There we are. All right?

31:15.854 --> 31:17.454
Are you going to say anything?

31:19.934 --> 31:22.934
Anything you'd like me to say? No.

31:25.054 --> 31:27.294
Then why say it?

32:51.934 --> 32:54.014
Where you going?

32:54.014 --> 32:56.094
Do you ever get a song
stuck in your head?

32:56.094 --> 32:58.534
And it just keeps going
round and round and round?

32:59.534 --> 33:04.934
T'Pau. China in Your Hand. Cool,
deep strangeness, that song.

33:04.934 --> 33:07.854
High weirdness. I've been thinking.

33:07.854 --> 33:09.894
She's a narcissist, isn't she?

33:09.894 --> 33:13.654
She needs constant recognition, needs
to exaggerate her accomplishments.

33:13.654 --> 33:18.174
How does someone like that keep secret
the most perfect thing she ever did?

33:18.174 --> 33:21.134
You don't need to be thinking
about Alice Morgan right now.

33:21.134 --> 33:25.534
Why? What do you suggest
I think about, hmm?

33:25.534 --> 33:27.374
My wife? Henry Madsen?

33:27.374 --> 33:29.414
I don't know. Normal
stuff. Breakfast.

33:29.414 --> 33:34.414
The way Alice Morgan sees it, is this world is full
of people that have offended her, embarrassed her,

33:34.414 --> 33:37.174
let her down, and those
people deserve to be punished.

33:37.174 --> 33:40.734
She's already gotten away with it
once and she's eyeing her next victim.

33:40.734 --> 33:44.054
And she won't stop until someone
stops her. Until I stop her.

33:44.054 --> 33:46.814
All right so be patient.
Build a case. There is no case!

33:46.814 --> 33:49.494
She didn't leave one.
She didn't leave anything.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.454
What, so what you thinking?
Well, she's compelled to impress.

33:52.454 --> 33:54.694
People in general, but
right now me in particular.

33:54.694 --> 33:58.454
She needs to show me how brilliant
she is. She needs to be admired.

33:58.454 --> 33:59.854
John... And I give that to her.

33:59.854 --> 34:01.534
I take it away, I make her angry.

34:01.534 --> 34:03.734
And then I watch her get careless.

34:03.734 --> 34:06.294
Slow down. I'll call you later.

34:15.734 --> 34:20.333
They burned my dog. It's
protocol. It's what happens.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.214
He was only a dog.

34:22.214 --> 34:25.454
It seems unduly pitiless to
me, to burn someone's dog.

34:25.454 --> 34:28.454
It seems kind of pitiless to
shoot the dog in the first place.

34:29.534 --> 34:34.574
You look exhausted.
Would you like to come in?

34:42.333 --> 34:47.774
(Are we being listened to?) Would it make
a difference? Who knows? No, we're not.

34:47.774 --> 34:51.054
So, you're not here
to interrogate me?

34:51.054 --> 34:52.494
No.

34:54.494 --> 34:55.893
Liar.

35:01.214 --> 35:02.974
This is a black hole.

35:02.974 --> 35:09.294
It consumes matter, sucks it in
and crushes it beyond existence.

35:09.294 --> 35:12.494
When I first heard that, I thought,
that's evil at its most pure.

35:12.494 --> 35:16.254
Something that drags you
in, crushes you, makes you...

35:17.774 --> 35:21.734
..nothing. I love to
talk about nothing.

35:21.734 --> 35:27.454
It's the only thing I know anything
about. Don't you believe in evil?

35:27.454 --> 35:31.214
I have to. I've seen it. Ah.

35:31.214 --> 35:35.614
Henry Madsen. Henry
and others like him.

35:35.614 --> 35:37.374
Me?

35:37.374 --> 35:38.934
Conceivably.

35:40.454 --> 35:45.414
What's happening to your marriage? Huh? Last
time I saw you, there was a ring. Today, no ring.

35:45.414 --> 35:47.574
Is someone else involved?

35:47.574 --> 35:49.454
I'm not here to discuss that, Alice.

35:49.454 --> 35:51.974
Is he handsome?

35:51.974 --> 35:55.294
If you like that sort of
thing, I guess. Are you in pain?

35:55.294 --> 35:56.894
You don't understand love, Alice.

35:56.894 --> 36:00.814
It's not your fault. You can mimic it and I
guess you can recognise it in other people,

36:00.814 --> 36:04.814
but you will never be
able to understand love.

36:14.774 --> 36:17.974
(Did you come here for sex?)

36:20.094 --> 36:22.494
No.

36:22.494 --> 36:25.534
Because you'd be
surprised how many men do.

36:25.534 --> 36:28.534
Do you think they have any
idea how fatuous they look?

36:28.534 --> 36:32.214
Well, some of us are afraid of that,
yeah. Then why? Why did I come here?

36:32.214 --> 36:38.174
Because I wanted to tell you that I know you
kept the gun and sooner or later I'll find it.

36:38.174 --> 36:41.654
Well, why would I do that? Ah, you
just couldn't help yourself, could you?

36:41.654 --> 36:45.134
Wouldn't it make things easy for
you if that were true? But it's not.

36:45.134 --> 36:48.774
There's no gun to find. See keeping
that gun wasn't a rational decision.

36:48.774 --> 36:53.814
It was a compulsion, you did
it because you needed to do it.

36:53.814 --> 37:01.734
And it's that compulsion that makes you weak
in ways that you can't see or understand.

37:01.734 --> 37:04.934
And it's that compulsion
that's going to get you caught,

37:04.934 --> 37:08.374
and it will bring you down, Alice,
it always does. Just like clockwork.

37:08.374 --> 37:10.854
Are you threatening me?
Because honestly, I wouldn't.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.574
And why's that? Come now, really.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.854
Because I'd be hurt and angry.

37:21.214 --> 37:23.214
I wonder.

37:25.214 --> 37:27.774
Why did your wife turn
her face from you, John?

37:29.374 --> 37:30.894
Why would she do that?

37:33.694 --> 37:36.574
(Is it because you shine so bright?)

37:49.374 --> 37:51.374
I'm coming for you.

37:51.374 --> 37:53.454
Not if I come for you first.

38:36.654 --> 38:38.494
Morning.

38:38.494 --> 38:40.334
Out you two, go on. John! Raus!

38:40.334 --> 38:46.454
Raus! Come on. If you're thinking of calling security,
don't bother. Call the police. Let's go. Arriba!

38:46.454 --> 38:50.734
Arriba! Andale! Andale! He's joking. This is
his sense of humour. This is my husband, John.

38:50.734 --> 38:52.894
That's right, I am her husband.

38:55.254 --> 38:56.974
Way to get me sacked.

38:56.974 --> 39:00.414
John, the people in this office,
they don't know you. They're scared.

39:00.414 --> 39:02.774
They think you're
going to do something.

39:04.094 --> 39:07.174
Do I embarrass you?

39:07.174 --> 39:09.694
Right now? Right at
this moment? Absolutely.

39:09.694 --> 39:11.774
Yes! Is that what this is all about?

39:11.774 --> 39:15.254
No! Am I boring?

39:15.254 --> 39:20.094
Hm, boring? Because, personally,
I don't think that I am boring.

39:20.094 --> 39:24.374
You're not boring. You're the
opposite of boring. And him?

39:24.374 --> 39:27.654
His name's Mark. Does a woman just get
to a stage in her life when she says,

39:27.654 --> 39:30.054
"You know what? I'd like
my man to be boring"?

39:30.054 --> 39:35.574
Because I have to tell you, no-one
warned me about this. He's not boring.

39:35.574 --> 39:37.334
Is the sex good?

39:37.334 --> 39:40.134
It's not about the sex.
It's always about the sex.

39:40.134 --> 39:42.414
You enjoy sex with him. You must.

39:42.414 --> 39:46.214
And that image just goes round
and round in my head like a train.

39:46.214 --> 39:48.854
The trouble with you, that
train in your head never stops!

39:48.854 --> 39:52.134
You really frightened me last night.

39:52.134 --> 39:56.094
Come on, Zoe, you know
I'd never, ever hurt you.

40:00.374 --> 40:04.414
John. Why are you here? Well,
I couldn't help but wonder

40:04.414 --> 40:08.814
if perhaps you'd like to come
home and be married to me?

40:11.534 --> 40:15.094
Some men bring flowers...
What, this was a grand gesture.

40:15.094 --> 40:17.734
This is professional
ruination, is what this is.

40:17.734 --> 40:19.374
Next time, think flowers.

40:19.374 --> 40:21.614
Next time?

40:21.614 --> 40:23.534
You know what I mean.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.854
I just need to know
why. You always do.

40:28.854 --> 40:32.334
But not everything has a motive.
Sometimes things just happen...

40:32.334 --> 40:37.174
That's not true, everything has a reason.
There are physical laws, I mean how did we...

40:37.174 --> 40:40.334
How did we get here? One minute
I'm one place and then next minute

40:40.334 --> 40:45.294
I'm 15,000 miles away and I know that I've travelled,
because I'm dizzy and I just want to throw up.

40:45.294 --> 40:49.134
I just can't remember the
bits in between. You tell me.

40:49.134 --> 40:50.774
How do you think we got here?

40:52.294 --> 40:53.814
What happened?

41:01.614 --> 41:04.334
OK.

41:04.334 --> 41:06.974
You're the reason.

41:06.974 --> 41:08.654
You are. You left.

41:08.654 --> 41:10.414
But I'm here.

41:10.414 --> 41:12.334
Now. Look at me. I'm here.

41:12.334 --> 41:16.094
Only part of you. Never all. You care
more about the dead than the living.

41:16.094 --> 41:18.414
That's where your heart
is. That is not true.

41:18.414 --> 41:23.134
All those years spent up to your neck in malignancy.
All those months looking for Henry Madsen.

41:23.134 --> 41:26.254
All the months that came after.
And you were just... gone.

41:26.254 --> 41:30.774
And you weren't coming back. Not,
not MY you. Not MY John. Then him?

41:32.774 --> 41:34.734
When he's with me, he's with me.

41:34.734 --> 41:38.534
Is that all it takes, Zoe, eh?

41:40.414 --> 41:42.334
Do you love him?

41:47.014 --> 41:48.414
Yes.

41:50.054 --> 41:51.814
I'm sorry.

41:53.534 --> 41:55.214
Oh, er...

41:57.214 --> 41:59.014
And me?

42:00.894 --> 42:04.774
Always. But not like that.

42:04.774 --> 42:06.654
Not any more.

42:08.574 --> 42:13.254
Look, I know it's a cruel thing to
hear, but you need to accept it, John.

42:13.254 --> 42:16.534
If you love me, you
need to accept it.

42:16.534 --> 42:19.174
I don't know how to do that.

42:20.134 --> 42:21.454
KNOCK ON DOOR

42:21.454 --> 42:23.934
Could you open the door please, sir?

42:26.174 --> 42:28.294
Could you open the door, please?

42:31.254 --> 42:37.014
I'm a policeman.

42:35.974 --> 42:37.014
I'm a policeman.

42:46.694 --> 42:50.214
How did you know I was here? Your phone
was off. DI Reed said "Try the wife."

42:50.214 --> 42:53.894
Oh, yeah? Any news on the
gun that killed the Morgans?

42:53.894 --> 42:56.574
We're still looking but ballistics
came back on the bullets.

42:56.574 --> 43:00.374
9mm Parabellum, designed
for ultra-compact weapons.

43:00.374 --> 43:01.934
Good work.

43:06.094 --> 43:07.134
Sod it.

43:16.134 --> 43:18.494
"Raus, Raus." Mother of God.

43:20.214 --> 43:21.614
ZOE GASPS

43:21.614 --> 43:27.094
Don't look at me. OK!
OK! Shh. OK. OK. OK.

43:29.254 --> 43:31.734
Your husband assaulted me. What?

43:31.734 --> 43:34.574
He touched me. Intimately.

43:34.574 --> 43:38.734
He made me do things. He hurt me.
Because of you. What do you mean?

43:38.734 --> 43:43.734
Well, as he touched me, he talked about you. He said
you were dead, that you'd been very badly burned.

43:43.734 --> 43:47.694
Your face was gone
and your skin was gone.

43:47.694 --> 43:51.374
You'd been abducted off the
street by a man, a very sick man.

43:51.374 --> 43:54.414
He kept you alive for days.

43:54.414 --> 43:56.934
He used knives.

43:56.934 --> 44:02.374
A blow torch. He kept
pieces of you for souvenirs.

44:04.134 --> 44:08.134
I'm worried that someone might
want to hurt you like that.

44:08.134 --> 44:11.774
Please, please don't. Shh. Shh.

44:15.014 --> 44:18.934
(Don't turn around.)

44:32.134 --> 44:33.614
PHONE RINGS

44:33.614 --> 44:35.134
DCI John Luther.

44:36.894 --> 44:41.054
Zoe? Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?

44:44.454 --> 44:46.854
Bloody hell!

44:46.854 --> 44:49.094
Honestly guv, you should
have just let me hold her.

44:49.094 --> 44:51.334
You didn't give me
enough to hold her.

44:51.334 --> 44:53.494
And you can't prove it
was her this afternoon.

44:53.494 --> 44:59.054
Zoe didn't see her face. No CCTV,
no eye witnesses, no nothing.

44:59.054 --> 45:01.974
You do know this makes me
Alice Morgan's next project?

45:03.494 --> 45:05.334
I questioned her
brilliance, offended her.

45:06.854 --> 45:08.654
Do you know what she could do?

45:08.654 --> 45:11.814
To me? To Zoe?

45:11.814 --> 45:15.014
I know what you say she can do.

45:15.014 --> 45:20.734
I also know we can't prove what she already did,
and you can't detain people on suspicion of crimes

45:20.734 --> 45:23.774
yet to be committed.
Be nice if we could.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.574
So what do I do to stop her?

45:31.214 --> 45:33.574
Bring her in the right way.

45:55.334 --> 45:57.094
Ah mate, mate, mate, thank you.

45:57.094 --> 45:58.774
Yeah, well.

45:58.774 --> 46:01.934
It's only a gun. So tell
me what I need to know?

46:01.934 --> 46:08.414
All right, so what you've got, this is a Glock 26,
lightweight compact pistol. Weighs less than 16 ounces.

46:08.414 --> 46:14.534
Carbon steel spring and barrel,
polymer frame and components.

46:14.534 --> 46:16.254
Polymer frame? Let me see that.

46:19.374 --> 46:21.654
Polymer. Plastic. Yeah. It's light.

46:21.654 --> 46:26.214
It's easy to carry. Plastic melts.

46:26.214 --> 46:28.014
Plastic melts. Why
am I thinking that?

46:31.454 --> 46:33.014
Of course.

47:00.294 --> 47:02.014
"Knock knock"? What?

47:02.014 --> 47:03.894
Never mind. What's this? So.

47:03.894 --> 47:07.094
Her parents get one shot to
the head each. Boom. Boom.

47:07.094 --> 47:10.654
And the dog gets four. Four
shots spent killing the dog.

47:10.654 --> 47:13.494
Why? It's a dog. It bites intruders.

47:13.494 --> 47:16.294
Why the overkill?
Perversity. I don't know.

47:16.294 --> 47:20.134
No, no. Four bullets in the
dog to maximise the mess.

47:20.134 --> 47:22.814
To make the cause
of death unambiguous.

47:22.814 --> 47:26.414
She needed to blow the dog's head
apart to access the digestive tract.

47:26.414 --> 47:31.654
She disassembles the gun, shoves the pieces,
the gloves, shell casings, down the dog's gullet,

47:31.654 --> 47:33.494
into its stomach.

47:33.494 --> 47:35.174
And then they cremate the dog.

47:35.174 --> 47:39.374
All right! It'll burn, watch. I have
absolutely no doubt. Look at that, it's melting.

47:39.374 --> 47:41.054
John, fine.

47:44.454 --> 47:47.014
It's not enough.

47:47.014 --> 47:48.934
The gun was in the dog!

47:48.934 --> 47:51.654
Section 8, Police and
Criminal Evidence Act.

47:51.654 --> 47:57.094
"A magistrate may issue a warrant authorising the search
of a premises provided there are reasonable grounds

47:57.094 --> 48:01.054
for believing the location contains
material with substantial evidentiary value".

48:01.054 --> 48:03.414
It's my assessment that
saying "the gun was in the dog"

48:03.414 --> 48:07.654
will not be judged by the issuing
magistrate to have met those criteria.

48:07.654 --> 48:09.454
It's in there. On the mantelpiece!

48:09.454 --> 48:15.334
And even if that were true, we can't prove that Alice
Morgan touched it, let alone fired it. We need more.

48:15.334 --> 48:18.494
We've got to trace the gun, put it
in her hands. It won't be traceable.

48:18.494 --> 48:21.734
She doesn't leave evidence,
just an evidence-shaped absence.

48:21.734 --> 48:26.094
And after everything else, that just
infuriates you, doesn't it? Come on!

48:26.094 --> 48:28.894
She kills her parents and walks.

48:28.894 --> 48:32.654
She threatens Zoe's life, we can't touch
her. This is Zoe we're talking about...

48:32.654 --> 48:35.774
John... ..who sat with your
kids the day your father died.

48:35.774 --> 48:38.094
So take the chilly bitch down.

48:38.094 --> 48:40.934
But slow down, calm
down, find another angle.

48:40.934 --> 48:43.134
There are no other angles!
She left us nothing!

48:43.134 --> 48:46.854
What do you need to prove more, that Alice
Morgan's guilty, or that you're right?

48:50.534 --> 48:53.294
John! Give me your wife's address.

48:53.294 --> 48:56.494
Why? I'll stay on her.
Make sure she's OK.

48:56.494 --> 48:57.974
You take down Alice Morgan.

49:39.534 --> 49:44.134
I told you, boss. The
gun was in the dog.

49:44.134 --> 49:45.414
Because she needs it.

50:15.054 --> 50:16.094
Alice.

50:41.334 --> 50:45.014
That would be mine.

50:45.014 --> 50:47.694
Hello, Alice. Do you know why
the gun fragments in that urn

50:47.694 --> 50:50.254
can never be used as
evidence against me?

50:50.254 --> 50:54.174
One, the cremation melted
away their forensic value.

50:54.174 --> 50:58.654
Because those ovens
burn very, very hot.

50:58.654 --> 51:02.614
Two, you could never prove that
I ever knew the gun was in there,

51:02.614 --> 51:05.614
let alone that I so much
as touched it. And three,

51:05.614 --> 51:10.014
most dazzlingly, you broke in
to my apartment and stole it.

51:10.014 --> 51:14.534
In the process you committed a crime that
will cost your job. So congratulations.

51:14.534 --> 51:16.374
Well done. I know that.

51:16.374 --> 51:19.894
This urn. This isn't evidence.

51:19.894 --> 51:23.294
This is what YOU need to remind
yourself of who you really are.

51:23.294 --> 51:25.174
That's why you followed me.

51:25.174 --> 51:27.854
I know you. I see you.

51:27.854 --> 51:29.854
And you think that I'm that weak?

51:29.854 --> 51:33.134
Yes. Then you don't know me at all.

51:34.614 --> 51:36.654
OK.

51:36.654 --> 51:38.934
No, John! No!

51:40.454 --> 51:42.094
Stay away from Zoe.

51:42.094 --> 51:44.014
Is this what you
did to Henry Madsen?

51:49.774 --> 51:54.654
So, go on. Kiss me. Kill me.

51:56.334 --> 51:57.854
Do something.

52:06.054 --> 52:07.854
Here's what's going to happen.

52:10.014 --> 52:12.174
You're going to stay
away from my wife,

52:12.174 --> 52:16.534
or I'm going to arrest someone
else for the murder of your parents.

52:18.054 --> 52:21.534
Oh, yeah, by the time he's found
guilty, you'll have been forgotten about.

52:21.534 --> 52:25.694
There will be no enigma with
Alice Morgan at the heart of it.

52:25.694 --> 52:29.054
No-one will wonder how you did it,
no-one will think how clever you were.

52:29.054 --> 52:32.854
I'll just plant the evidence.
I don't need the gun.

52:32.854 --> 52:37.814
You'd degrade the law you serve, just to
protect some woman who cast you aside like offal?

52:40.854 --> 52:42.414
In a second.

52:43.934 --> 52:46.694
And you think I'M the monster?

52:46.694 --> 52:50.054
Love is supposed to
dignify us! Exalt us!

52:50.054 --> 52:56.294
How can it be love, John, if all it
does is make you lonely and corrupt?

52:59.934 --> 53:01.694
Answer the question.

53:01.694 --> 53:03.774
Don't turn your back on me!

53:46.134 --> 53:48.814
All right, Justin. You can go
home now, all right? You sure?

53:48.814 --> 53:50.574
Yeah. Yeah. I'm good.

53:50.574 --> 53:52.214
OK. All right. You sure, yeah?

53:52.214 --> 53:54.094
I'm very sure.

53:54.094 --> 53:55.734
Go on.

53:57.614 --> 53:58.814
ENGINE STARTS

54:06.374 --> 54:08.974
DOORBELL BUZZES

54:08.974 --> 54:10.494
Zo?

54:10.494 --> 54:11.614
BUZZING CONTINUES

54:14.814 --> 54:16.374
He'll leave. Let him go.

54:16.374 --> 54:20.374
Zoe. No. Sod him. He
doesn't get to do this.

54:20.374 --> 54:22.374
Zoe?

54:24.374 --> 54:26.174
I hate to do this,
it's my ex-husband.

54:26.174 --> 54:28.414
He's... He's, er, I don't know...

54:28.414 --> 54:29.934
Zo.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.214
DOORBELL BUZZES

54:31.214 --> 54:32.254
Zoe.

54:36.054 --> 54:38.894
It's Mark, innit? That's right,
yeah. John, you need to go.

54:38.894 --> 54:40.414
We called the police.

54:41.414 --> 54:44.134
Come on this is mad. What do
you want? I want to speak to Zoe.

54:44.134 --> 54:48.254
