00:03.137 --> 00:06.072
(theme music playing)

00:19.753 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.120
(clock ticking)

01:23.484 --> 01:25.475
(humming quietly)

01:31.225 --> 01:33.386
(continues humming)

01:44.405 --> 01:45.565
(whispers):
Sybil.

01:50.678 --> 01:55.482
"Scrape the skin from the back
of a hairless animal."

01:55.482 --> 01:57.473
Wickedness.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.616
(sighs)

02:36.557 --> 02:38.358
(footsteps approaching)

02:38.358 --> 02:39.416
Sybil.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.054
Ma?

02:45.265 --> 02:47.101
Ma!

02:47.101 --> 02:49.970
I don't want to know
where you got that book, Sybil,

02:49.970 --> 02:51.305
or what you paid for it.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.207
But I want to know
if you've been using it!

02:53.207 --> 02:55.743
It won't burn!
I know what that means!

02:55.743 --> 02:57.444
It tells me
where that book was written!

02:57.444 --> 03:00.311
Sybil, what's wrong?!

03:13.060 --> 03:14.823
(whispering):
0h, poor girl.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.710
Who did it?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.871
Annie Lee.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.017
Claims I stole
her husband's soul.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.819
Claims I made him love me.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.887
Did you?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.321
Annie Lee always hated me.

03:41.321 --> 03:44.057
I didn't go after
Annie Lee's husband;

03:44.057 --> 03:45.217
he come after me.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.328
I know you, Sybil.

03:48.328 --> 03:50.731
Did it out of mischief.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.400
You don't care anything about
Annie Lee's husband.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.902
You just want to make trouble.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.166
Well, I'm gonna be
punished for it, Ma.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.374
I'll be dead by midnight.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.675
Hush.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.735
I need to sleep, Ma.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.924
Sybil, where's that black book?

04:16.924 --> 04:17.913
Sybil.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.983
Sybil!

04:22.029 --> 04:24.031
Sybil!

04:24.031 --> 04:25.899
Sybil, I went down
to the Pages'

04:25.899 --> 04:27.801
and their boy's
going for the doctor.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.404
MA:
Oh!

04:30.404 --> 04:33.907
What on earth are you doing?

04:33.907 --> 04:37.570
Passing the time till I die.

04:44.218 --> 04:48.522
That one's for Annie Lee,
and this one's for her husband.

04:48.522 --> 04:51.355
You're a wicked girl.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.150
(blows)

04:57.431 --> 05:00.000
(Sybil laughs)

05:00.000 --> 05:01.969
(sighs)

05:01.969 --> 05:04.037
MA:
You could die, girl.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.540
You should be
making your peace with God,

05:06.540 --> 05:08.275
not laying a curse
on your enemies.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.310
I'm warning you, Sybil.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.146
This is a terrible way
to leave this earth.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.148
I said I was gonna die, Ma,

05:15.148 --> 05:17.878
but I didn't say anything
about leaving this earth.

05:28.061 --> 05:29.096
(kisses)

05:29.096 --> 05:31.428
(door opens, closes)

05:33.433 --> 05:35.993
Ma, who was that?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.776
That was Leroy, the Pages' boy.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.978
He said the doctor
was in Babylon today,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.847
probably wouldn't get here
till in the morning.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.508
It'll be too late.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.053
Leroy said something else.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.044
What'd he say, Ma?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.928
He said Annie Lee was dead.

06:00.928 --> 06:03.664
Well, that was sudden.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.962
Eugene shot her.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.636
After he found out
she stabbed you.

06:11.338 --> 06:13.307
You did it, didn't you?

06:13.307 --> 06:14.508
With that candle.

06:14.508 --> 06:17.144
I didn't do nothing, Ma.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.135
(clock chiming)

06:20.981 --> 06:24.551
"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

06:24.551 --> 06:29.089
"I will fear no evil,
for Thou art with me.

06:29.089 --> 06:32.926
"Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.196
"Thou preparest
a table before me

06:36.196 --> 06:38.994
in the presence
of mine enemies."

06:40.534 --> 06:42.525
Sybil?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.005
Can you hear me?

06:47.607 --> 06:50.711
You are an evil daughter.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.646
You caused me
nothing but pain and trouble

06:52.646 --> 06:55.449
since the day you were born.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.551
But I have loved you.

06:57.551 --> 07:01.421
I've loved you like you was
one of Jehovah's angels.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.413
I've loved you against my will
and my inclination.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.296
And I loved you
when I knew you was in league

07:09.296 --> 07:11.856
with the things
that gave you that black book.

07:13.800 --> 07:17.504
I won't weep now...

07:17.504 --> 07:21.408
'cause you never did one thing
to deserve my tears.

07:21.408 --> 07:24.673
So you do love me.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.615
I do.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.751
I love you, too, Ma.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.753
And I don't want to leave you.

07:32.753 --> 07:36.490
But you know and I know
you'll be dead in the morning.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.892
Maybe.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.228
But that don't mean
I have to leave you.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.698
I don't want to hear this!

07:44.698 --> 07:46.400
I got a last wish, Ma.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.636
I want you to do
something for me.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.405
I'll pray for your soul.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.498
Something else.

07:56.943 --> 07:59.179
I'll know when
I'm about to die, Ma.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.715
And I'll tell you.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.183
And when that time comes,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.651
I want you to tie a cloth
over my mouth.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.223
Why?

08:10.223 --> 08:12.292
'Cause that's how the soul
leaves the body, Ma.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.494
You know that.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.796
Then, when I'm dead,

08:15.796 --> 08:18.331
you pull the cloth
and put a jar over my mouth,

08:18.331 --> 08:21.134
and you catch
what comes out my mouth.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.104
And don't let it
out of that jar.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.299
Otherwise, I can't come back.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.877
What do you mean, "come back"?

08:30.877 --> 08:35.115
Before dawn, I'll come back
and get whatever's in thatjar.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.349
Will you do it?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.151
No.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.553
You have to!

08:39.553 --> 08:42.852
It's your only daughter's
dying wish.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.902
(wolf howls in distance)

08:55.902 --> 08:58.132
(screaming)

09:02.976 --> 09:05.412
Hurry, Ma!

09:05.412 --> 09:07.280
(gasping)
Please, Ma!

09:07.280 --> 09:08.882
Please, do it!

09:08.882 --> 09:11.051
I don't have much time!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.386
(Sybil panting)

09:13.386 --> 09:16.523
Stuff my mouth.
Ma, I'm dying!

09:16.523 --> 09:18.115
(Sybil gasping)

09:21.528 --> 09:23.519
(grunting)

09:25.332 --> 09:27.033
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.201
Tighter!

09:28.201 --> 09:29.402
Tighter, Ma!

09:29.402 --> 09:31.131
Yes, all right, all right.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.104
MA (whispers):
There.

09:38.678 --> 09:41.545
(panting)

09:47.621 --> 09:50.223
(exhales deeply)

09:50.223 --> 09:51.558
(Ma sobs)

09:51.558 --> 09:53.226
Poor girl.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.922
(crying)

10:14.781 --> 10:16.840
(chittering)

10:26.226 --> 10:28.217
(chittering continues)

10:34.167 --> 10:36.970
I didn't punch any holes
in the top of that jar,

10:36.970 --> 10:40.140
but you're still alive.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.975
You're not a moth at all.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.410
You're something else.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.580
That's cheating God.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.149
May even be cheating the Devil.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.276
(chittering continues)

10:54.487 --> 10:57.958
Darling, if you came back,

10:57.958 --> 11:00.660
you'd just cause more trouble.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.828
You're dead.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.732
If you don't lie still,

11:05.732 --> 11:08.792
you'll be an evil, evil thing.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.396
I can't let you do it.

11:47.741 --> 11:48.867
(jar thuds onto floor)

12:03.723 --> 12:05.247
(gasps)

12:12.098 --> 12:13.929
(Ma whimpers, gasps)

12:23.977 --> 12:26.639
So you're the only one
that can open it.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.387
-(chittering) -MA: "Circle the
day of death with blood.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.290
"Surround the body with water.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.360
"These are the barriers used
to prevent the dead

12:40.360 --> 12:44.023
from recapturing their souls. "

12:56.343 --> 12:59.479
My poor baby said
she was coming back for you.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.881
(chittering)

13:01.881 --> 13:05.785
She has to get you back in her
mouth before dawn, doesn't she?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.288
Or she can't come back.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.224
Well, Ijust found out
how to stop her.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.692
(chittering grows louder)

13:29.876 --> 13:34.114
Be still just a little while
longer, my darlin'.

13:34.114 --> 13:36.549
Don't get up just yet.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.386
Morning's a long way
away, honey.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.184
You got plenty of time.

14:04.010 --> 14:04.999
(glass shattering)

14:29.502 --> 14:31.936
(snapping)

14:36.242 --> 14:39.370
Just a few minutes more,
darlin'.

14:44.951 --> 14:47.351
(wind whistling)

14:49.522 --> 14:51.724
(wood creaking)

14:51.724 --> 14:54.784
(owl hooting)

15:05.138 --> 15:06.306
Not yet, baby.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.141
It's not time to get up yet.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.576
Ma'll tell you when.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.443
(wind whistling)

15:31.130 --> 15:33.121
(floorboards creaking)

15:38.938 --> 15:41.463
Just one more thing.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.905
SYBIL:
Ma...

16:11.905 --> 16:13.740
Ma!

16:13.740 --> 16:15.575
Who's that calling?

16:15.575 --> 16:18.344
Sybil.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.780
MA:
Sybil's dead.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.113
Ma, help me. I'm confused.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.553
I'm not surprised, darlin'.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.621
You died earlier this evening.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.890
I can't be dead, Ma.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.693
I can smell the pines.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.185
What you smell is the pine
boards of your coffin, darlin'.

16:42.969 --> 16:46.072
But I'm not in my coffin, Ma.

16:46.072 --> 16:49.676
Coffins are confining,
and I just sat up straight.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.702
I'm in my old bed, Ma.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.212
That's as may be, but you're
still dead, girl.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.354
Did you save what came out
my mouth, Ma?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.549
It's here.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.861
Looks like a moth.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.522
SYBIL:
I'll come for it.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.834
Why can't I get to you, Ma?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.569
Because you're dead.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.638
The dead don't want
to cross water.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.407
You must be wrong, Ma.

17:21.407 --> 17:24.035
This isn't water; it's milk.

17:29.949 --> 17:33.286
What's this on the dresser, Ma?

17:33.286 --> 17:34.721
A barrette.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.456
Belonged to my daughter.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.825
I broke it when she died.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.293
Has her name on it.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.282
Sybil?

17:42.662 --> 17:44.464
That must be you.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.899
But I'm not dead yet.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.301
Yes, you are.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.603
MA:
See the clock?

17:50.603 --> 17:54.607
I stopped the clock
when you died.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.110
See the calendar?

17:57.110 --> 17:59.912
With my own blood, I circled
the day that you died.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.748
I wouldn't do that
if you weren't dead.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.512
I need my soul back, Mama.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.484
What's this?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.620
What's what?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.920
What does it feel like?

18:20.133 --> 18:22.192
Feels like... sand.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.941
It's the earth piled
above your coffin.

18:28.941 --> 18:29.976
No!

18:29.976 --> 18:32.111
Yes.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.280
Is there much of it?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.549
I don't know, I can't see.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.851
Why don't you count
the sand, Sybil?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.920
Count the grains.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.912
You can't come in till I know
how deep you're buried.

18:45.958 --> 18:49.562
SYBIL:
One, two,

18:49.562 --> 18:54.400
three, four,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.135
five,

18:56.135 --> 18:59.072
six,

18:59.072 --> 19:00.506
seven...

19:00.506 --> 19:02.909
(chittering)

19:02.909 --> 19:05.011
11,208...

19:05.011 --> 19:07.447
(rooster crowing)

19:07.447 --> 19:10.917
11,209...

19:10.917 --> 19:14.910
11,210...

19:15.922 --> 19:17.719
(sand scraping)

19:39.746 --> 19:42.348
You tricked me!

19:42.348 --> 19:44.407
(chittering)

19:53.526 --> 19:54.515
(grunts)

20:27.326 --> 20:28.361
(Sybil's voice):
You should've let me

20:28.361 --> 20:30.852
come back for my soul, Ma.

20:40.273 --> 20:44.710
Not all my tricks were
written down in that book.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.672
Sleep tight, Ma.

21:18.144 --> 21:21.948
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.483
Waiting for us to enter.

21:24.483 --> 21:27.720
Waiting to enter us.

21:27.720 --> 21:34.717
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
