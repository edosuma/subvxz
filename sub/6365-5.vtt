WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:04.036
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
I am with child.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.038
Our child, at last.
(chuckles)

00:06.040 --> 00:06.672
What's your name?

00:06.674 --> 00:07.706
I'm henry.

00:07.708 --> 00:10.476
<i>The joust.</i>
<i>The way he held the lance,</i>

00:10.478 --> 00:12.444
<i>Aimed at my head.</i>

00:12.446 --> 00:14.213
<i>It was not montgomery.</i>

00:14.215 --> 00:15.414
<i>It was some other man.</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:16.482
Would you dare raise a hand

00:16.484 --> 00:18.784
Against your own...
Stop!

00:18.786 --> 00:20.652
Francis:
<i>Opposing narcisse</i>
<i>has become a bad habit,</i>

00:20.654 --> 00:22.621
Dangerous even
when we're right.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.323
Don't pretend
this is about money.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.226
You want power.
You want revenge.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.193
You're bleeding.
(hisses)

00:28.195 --> 00:30.129
I'm losing my child.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.163
We spoke with the shepherd.
He was set upon

00:31.165 --> 00:33.132
<i>By three cloaked riders.</i>

00:33.134 --> 00:36.168
He says they offered protection
<i>in exchange for his soul.</i>

00:36.170 --> 00:37.803
<i>Maybe catholics trying</i>
<i>to make protestants</i>

00:37.805 --> 00:38.604
Reek of the devil.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.773
Strip him.
No.

00:42.108 --> 00:44.109
The mark of the riders.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.813
(sheep bleats)

00:47.815 --> 00:52.451
There is too much fear
in this land.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.286
Fear of hunger, fear

00:54.288 --> 00:57.056
Of disease. To this

00:57.058 --> 01:00.059
We add fear of catholics,
our fellow christians.

01:00.061 --> 01:03.796
But this is precisely
why you are here.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.431
To commune with your god.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.433
Not mine.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.634
W...

01:09.602 --> 01:11.303
What's this then?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.642
Looks like... A church service.

01:20.713 --> 01:23.148
Huh.

01:23.150 --> 01:26.318
What do you want?
What's a
highborn squire

01:26.320 --> 01:29.655
Like you doing
with this protestant lot?

01:29.657 --> 01:31.423
No! No!

01:31.425 --> 01:32.324
Leave the boy alone!

01:33.159 --> 01:34.326
What do you want with him?!

01:34.328 --> 01:36.462
(gasping)

01:42.836 --> 01:45.671
(shouting)

01:51.778 --> 01:54.313
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

01:57.183 --> 01:59.485
â™ª they all need something

01:59.487 --> 02:04.423
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

02:04.425 --> 02:08.193
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

02:08.195 --> 02:11.763
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

02:11.765 --> 02:15.167
â™ª

02:22.909 --> 02:25.444
Mary:
<i>I won't ask you</i>

02:25.446 --> 02:28.280
How much money you lost
dicing with bash last night,

02:28.282 --> 02:30.282
Because then you'd have to lie.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.417
I forgot what a terrible liar
my brother is.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.419
So you already know
we weren't playing dice.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.355
What I don't know
is what you <i>were</i> doing.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.259
Well, the truth is I was...

02:40.261 --> 02:41.293
Visiting my son

02:41.295 --> 02:43.362
In the nursery.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.230
See, this is why
I didn't tell you.

02:45.232 --> 02:47.633
It's a sensitive subject,
only days since...

02:47.635 --> 02:51.336
I'm not a porcelain doll,
francis.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.306
It's true I lost our baby.

02:54.308 --> 02:57.910
And, yes, it hurts.
But we got pregnant once.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.579
We can do it again.
I'm glad to hear you say it.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.181
Perhaps you wouldn't be
so surprised

03:02.183 --> 03:03.949
If you stopped avoiding
the subject.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.185
The way you tiptoe
around it

03:06.187 --> 03:07.653
Makes me think
you've given up hope.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.289
I have not given up hope.

03:11.491 --> 03:12.824
I love you.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.726
And I believe in you.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.962
Believe in us.

03:16.964 --> 03:18.697
(knocking)

03:19.666 --> 03:22.234
Enter.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.304
What's wrong?
Another attack

03:25.306 --> 03:26.805
On a protestant service.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.574
This time in our
own backyard.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.442
A village barn used
as a makeshift church.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.277
Were there
any casualties?
Leith: That's still unclear.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.446
But they did set fire
to the barn.
Go and help

03:34.448 --> 03:36.215
Whoever you can.
Find out what happened

03:36.217 --> 03:37.983
And capture whoever
led this attack.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.484
I will not tolerate
this kind of violence,

03:39.486 --> 03:41.453
No matter what prompts it.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.889
(indistinct chatter)

03:43.891 --> 03:47.326
When I was a girl, I dreamed
of a wedding like this.

03:47.328 --> 03:50.729
It's spectacular. Befitting
its spectacular bride.

03:50.731 --> 03:54.399
Truthfully, I would've preferred
something simpler.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.368
For your sake
or for leith's?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.237
Marrying aloysius
is enough,

03:58.239 --> 03:59.671
Without flaunting all
of this in his face.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.007
Is that
what castleroy's doing?

04:02.009 --> 04:03.609
Goodness, no.
It's my mother.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.943
(chuckles)

04:04.945 --> 04:06.478
Oh, no.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.481
It's all right.
This is gemma,

04:09.483 --> 04:11.350
Aloysius' youngest. His children
are here for the wedding.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.851
And now they're
your children.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.487
Yes. I'll fix
this for you.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.656
Oh, what pretty
locks you have.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.292
Thank you.
Mmm.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.628
(chuckles)
well, they seem

04:22.630 --> 04:24.696
To be very taken
with you.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.366
Enough about me.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.668
What about you?
How are you feeling?

04:29.670 --> 04:31.670
Well, let's just say
your wedding

04:31.672 --> 04:33.572
Is a welcome distraction.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.615
Whoa... Whoa.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.384
(clicks tongue)

04:45.386 --> 04:47.419
What have you found?

04:47.421 --> 04:50.022
They burned the barn
to the ground. No one was there.

04:50.024 --> 04:51.857
But we located
riderless horses nearby.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.492
The fire must have scared

04:53.494 --> 04:55.827
The horses away.
So there are people on foot.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.362
Shall the men go after the ones
who burned the barn?

04:57.364 --> 04:59.364
I want them brought back
to the castle.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.900
Gently.
You heard him.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.535
I want you to take
the rest of these men

05:03.537 --> 05:05.604
And find those
protestant victims.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.506
Assure them
they'll be protected.

05:15.948 --> 05:17.816
They're coming from the
direction of the barn.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.656
Let me have a talk with them.
If we want their help, best not

05:24.658 --> 05:26.958
To have them intimidated
by a group of king's guards.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.729
Lord castleroy.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.964
What are you
doing here?
Leith, please,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.866
I beg you.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.571
All right, you cannot be here.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.973
There's king's guards searching
the woods everywhere. Just go.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.477
These aren't the men
we're looking for.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.978
I recognize these people.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.413
The gentleman's a
friend of the king.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.648
You're certain?

05:49.650 --> 05:50.982
Let's keep looking.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.824
(women chuckling, moaning)

06:10.837 --> 06:12.838
Have you lost your minds?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.740
Oh. Uh, please,
my lady...

06:14.742 --> 06:18.543
Don't mistake me. I do not judge
your predilections. In fact,

06:18.545 --> 06:21.113
I'm rather impressed. But doing
it out here in the open?

06:21.115 --> 06:23.615
What were you thinking?
What was that?

06:23.617 --> 06:24.616
Nothing, my lady.

06:24.618 --> 06:25.917
Give it.

06:28.087 --> 06:29.721
It's a journal.

06:29.723 --> 06:32.023
A chambermaid found it in
the laundry months ago.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.459
We would have returned it, but
the owner never wrote her name.

06:34.461 --> 06:37.429
We've been passing it amongst
ourselves as a distraction.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.965
Well, this is smut.

06:39.967 --> 06:43.068
And reading it clearly led to...

06:43.070 --> 06:45.036
This.
So...

06:45.038 --> 06:47.939
As punishment,
I'm confiscating it.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.923
(indistinct shouting)

07:29.582 --> 07:31.650
Francis.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.884
You're needed
in the throne room.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.553
It's about the attack
on the protestants.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.621
Is there any news?
From what I can tell,

07:36.623 --> 07:39.591
Yes, but I'm not sure what.

07:39.593 --> 07:43.061
Isn't that the nanny
you dismissed weeks ago?
Yes.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.996
But now my son is unwell,
and lola requested

07:44.998 --> 07:46.998
Her advice on how best
to treat him.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.100
Mary, will you go to the
throne room in my stead?

07:49.102 --> 07:50.702
Find out what's happening.
I'll be there soon.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.611
Caroline,

07:59.613 --> 08:02.614
What are you doing here?

08:02.616 --> 08:04.783
I don't know.

08:10.756 --> 08:13.158
Do you know
what this is?
Your grace,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.627
I'm frightened.
It's just some relic

08:15.629 --> 08:18.096
The surgeons kept
after my father died.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.099
A gruesome practice, frankly,
but I found it in my chambers

08:21.101 --> 08:24.202
And then I found you
outside my door.

08:24.204 --> 08:27.138
Did you place
this on my bed?
I keep waking up places

08:27.140 --> 08:29.875
I don't
remember going.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.843
More every day.

08:33.713 --> 08:35.914
(crying)

08:37.583 --> 08:40.719
Caroline, do you remember
where the infirmary is?

08:42.688 --> 08:45.757
Go there and rest.
I'll look in on you later.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.893
And for your own sake,

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
Don't tell anyone
what you've told me.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.601
(indistinct chatter)

09:02.708 --> 09:05.043
Who is this poor boy
and what happened to him?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.212
Begging your mercy, majesty,

09:07.214 --> 09:08.747
But this young man
was murdered.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.782
Beaten to death by thugs.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.584
What for?

09:12.586 --> 09:13.919
For holding unpopular beliefs.

09:13.921 --> 09:16.221
Then you are the protestants
who were attacked

09:16.223 --> 09:18.957
In the barn?
We are, majesty.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.792
And I am their minister.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.661
Protestant heretics.
Throw them out!

09:22.663 --> 09:25.063
These men are guests of
the crown, and they will

09:25.065 --> 09:26.631
Be respected.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.866
I will have order
in this chamber.

09:30.770 --> 09:33.004
It took much courage to be here.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.941
And what do you want?
No great favor, majesty.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.109
Only justice.
Catholic thugs

09:38.111 --> 09:40.345
Dragged this boy
from our service

09:40.347 --> 09:42.247
And murdered him.
The law says

09:42.249 --> 09:45.250
A man who kills must pay
with his life.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.252
Justice for heretics?
That's absurd!

09:47.254 --> 09:49.621
Silence! I said I
would have respect

09:49.623 --> 09:51.189
For these men and I'll have it.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.792
Lord condÃ©?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.126
What is it?
Do you know this boy?

09:55.128 --> 09:56.761
This is my sister's son.

09:57.964 --> 09:59.831
Emile.

10:00.833 --> 10:03.268
Emile.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.836
They murdered my nephew!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.778
My sister sent emile to
live at my house here

10:13.780 --> 10:15.213
Because this part of
France was considered

10:15.215 --> 10:17.782
More tolerant than
where he was attending school.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.718
I will not tolerate
that kind of behavior.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.353
Not here
or in any part of France.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.788
The flogging and burning?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.724
Or the practice
of protestantism?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.158
Catherine:
Francis, be careful.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.827
The throne doesn't judge
what a man believes

10:28.829 --> 10:30.028
In his heart.
We only judge

10:30.030 --> 10:31.296
What he does
with his hands.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.697
I will not tolerate violence

10:32.699 --> 10:34.733
For any reason.
It's against the law.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.869
It is also against the law not
to worship as rome requires.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.838
You're avoiding the question.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.239
Will you rule
as your father did,

10:41.241 --> 10:42.841
And condemn the protestants?

10:42.843 --> 10:44.042
Or will you condone
their religion?

10:44.044 --> 10:45.910
Do not ask me to
rule on that today.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.413
Protestant rebellions
in England and scotland,

10:48.415 --> 10:50.715
Catholic rulers
losing their thrones.

10:50.717 --> 10:54.219
I am in no rush to import
that struggle to France.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.854
Your grace, it is already here.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.957
Not openly. Not yet.

11:00.926 --> 11:04.863
My nephew wasn't marked
for death by accident.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.398
These thugs chose their victim
to send a message.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.267
To you?
But you're a catholic.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.769
I have a brother,
the king of navarre,

11:10.771 --> 11:12.170
Who's converted
to protestantism.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.239
My sister is known to be leaning
in the same direction.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.141
Surely
you're aware.
I am.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.143
And I have made no secret
of my frustrations

11:18.145 --> 11:19.844
With rome's corruption.
Francis:
If what you say

11:19.846 --> 11:21.413
Is true, we'll learn of it,
and the guilty will pay,

11:21.415 --> 11:22.947
As the law
requires.

11:22.949 --> 11:25.183
Even if that means death.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.756
Lola:
There you are.

11:31.758 --> 11:34.693
We're supposed to be trying
on dresses for greer's wedding.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.027
We'll find something
before tomorrow.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.796
Kenna, what are you reading?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.131
It's a sex journal
written by a lady

11:40.133 --> 11:42.367
Who's sampled most of the
nobleman to come through court.

11:42.369 --> 11:43.768
And a fair few
noblewomen, too.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.737
She even rated the
prowess of her partners.

11:45.739 --> 11:49.040
Really? How far does
this journal go back?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.842
Two years.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.043
Is bash in it?
Not so far.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.445
Definitely not since
we've been married.

11:53.447 --> 11:55.013
All the entries are dated.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.314
How do you know it's real?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.749
She doesn't even mention names.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.851
Because I know
the partners.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.853
Oh, not because I've
slept with them.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.189
Because there are
details about their dress,

12:04.191 --> 12:06.758
Their holdings, their
habits, that make it clear.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.261
Except for one has me
stumped and intrigued.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.464
"a lover who towers
above the rest."

12:12.466 --> 12:14.199
She says he's an avid hunter,

12:14.201 --> 12:16.234
And has a small butterfly-shaped
birthmark on his forearm.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.136
That rules out
henry and bash.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.038
It's not julien, either.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.006
What about francis?

12:23.809 --> 12:25.877
We have to find who
the mystery lover is.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.880
Why?
For you.

12:28.882 --> 12:30.949
Well, ever since francis
publicly claimed your baby,

12:30.951 --> 12:32.283
You've been mooning about,

12:32.285 --> 12:34.119
Saying how no man
will come near you

12:34.121 --> 12:35.920
Because they think you're
the king's mistress.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.989
This mysterious and
exalted bachelor could be

12:37.991 --> 12:39.324
Just the fun romance
that you need.

12:39.326 --> 12:41.292
From what I've read,
he cares very little

12:41.294 --> 12:42.827
For a woman's station
or reputation.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.262
Only that she's agile.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.964
You're mad.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.932
I can't go chasing
after some strange man.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.868
I'm already the subject
of relentless gossip.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.469
What do you have to lose?

12:51.471 --> 12:53.872
And besides which, has anyone
said anything to your face?

12:53.874 --> 12:56.307
No.
And they
never will.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.076
For fear of offending the king.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.978
So why not take a lover?

12:59.980 --> 13:02.213
Be with him a
week, or a year.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.415
It might not lead to marriage,
but it could lead to love.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.917
Or at least some fun.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.152
You could use some fun, lola.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.853
Admit it.

13:08.855 --> 13:11.222
I will only admit that
I'm curious who this man is.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.558
Well, then let's find him,
and see if he can spark

13:13.560 --> 13:17.028
Your curiosity for more.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.230
Francis:
These are the men
who attacked the protestants?

13:19.232 --> 13:21.232
You should know they
think their crimes

13:21.234 --> 13:23.868
Are justified.
What justifies murder?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.937
I'll let their eminent advocates
fill you in.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.875
Francis:
Narcisse.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.215
Who is this?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.917
This stable boy's name
is marc d'linde.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.819
As he would tell you himself,
if he could still speak.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.821
(groaning)
or walk.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.923
Or move.
And you think
condÃ©'s nephew

13:44.925 --> 13:46.457
Emile did this?
Witnesses say

13:46.459 --> 13:48.293
Marc was leaving
a catholic mass

13:48.295 --> 13:50.995
When emile took a rock and
threw it with all his strength.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.463
You see the results.
That's absurd.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.966
Why would my nephew
do such a thing?
I have no idea.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.935
Perhaps marc insulted emile
in some way.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.403
Does it really matter?

13:58.405 --> 14:00.371
I implore you, majesty,

14:00.373 --> 14:01.906
Release these men.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.007
If you release them, you will be

14:03.009 --> 14:04.609
Smiling on murder.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.878
Your catholic subjects
implore you,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.080
Including your catholic lords.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.348
Who bow before you now.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.452
Begging you.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.500
Do you recognize this man?

14:29.502 --> 14:32.136
What's this about?

14:33.072 --> 14:35.073
Oh, that.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.209
You may go, marie.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.145
And please, your hair.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.184
My ladies brought this
to me months ago.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.119
I read it in an hour.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.488
We thought one of your flying
squad might know something

14:50.490 --> 14:52.023
About the men in there.

14:52.025 --> 14:55.360
The hunter with
a butterfly-shaped birthmark?

14:55.362 --> 14:58.062
My money's on lord aris.

14:58.064 --> 14:59.364
Why him? How
do you know?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.966
You've been sampling
the court dishes yourself?

15:01.968 --> 15:04.102
Henry died. I live.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.437
Are you moving on
from that poor bastard

15:06.439 --> 15:09.140
Of a husband of yours
so quickly?
No.

15:09.142 --> 15:11.576
Oh, then it's you
who seeks a lover.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.045
We are merely curious.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.115
I read the book after I made...

15:17.117 --> 15:20.018
The acquaintance of lord aris,
and I'd offer

15:20.020 --> 15:21.986
To revisit and investigate,

15:21.988 --> 15:25.456
But a few certain someones
might get jealous.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.058
Good luck
with your search.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.294
You'll need it.

15:29.296 --> 15:32.096
Aris likes his women
with a bit more spark.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.100
I've been
looking for you.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.502
I have good news.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.971
Francis refused
to bow to narcisse

15:39.973 --> 15:42.040
And release the murderers of
your nephew. He's also sent bash

15:42.042 --> 15:44.142
To find out what really happened
to that injured stable boy.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.144
I already know
more than enough.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.379
I went into the village
and asked about this boy,

15:48.381 --> 15:50.148
And no one had
heard of him.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.183
Narcisse said this boy was
injured outside of a village

15:52.185 --> 15:54.385
Church, but he's not from the
village or anywhere near here.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.020
I think they combed the
countryside, and searched

15:56.022 --> 15:58.323
For someone with injuries
they could blame on my nephew.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.191
Either that, or they had
this in mind all along.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.026
You sincerely believe

16:02.028 --> 16:04.462
This was a planned attack
against your family?

16:07.032 --> 16:09.267
Dear god. That's...

16:09.269 --> 16:11.970
The brand of the
three dark riders.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.172
I assume francis
told you about them?

16:14.174 --> 16:16.374
He did.
I met them the
other night.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.209
Very unpleasant.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.112
I assume you think I'm soulless
now, possessed by the devil?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.147
That's what this mark
is supposed to mean.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.183
Of course not.

16:25.185 --> 16:29.187
You and I know that these riders
are nothing but paid brutes,

16:29.189 --> 16:31.422
The same kind who
have killed emile.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.726
Thugs that catch a man strolling
at night, hold him down,

16:34.728 --> 16:37.295
Then press a burning acid
brand into his skin.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.097
You really believe

16:39.099 --> 16:42.000
That catholic extremists
are responsible for all of this?

16:42.002 --> 16:45.303
Your branding,
the murder of your nephew?

16:45.305 --> 16:47.271
Do you have any proof?

16:47.273 --> 16:49.507
Not yet.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.609
But I think this
brand is a sign.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.411
They wanted me to know
that whenever they choose,

16:53.413 --> 16:55.246
They can lift up my
shirt and demonize me.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.215
So that no matter
what they accuse me of,

16:57.217 --> 17:00.351
No one will
dare defend me.
But why?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.153
I don't know what
their plan is,

17:02.155 --> 17:03.521
But rage and mistrust is
building across France,

17:03.523 --> 17:05.189
And maybe that's
their intention.

17:05.191 --> 17:08.226
To see France explode.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.761
(indistinct shouting)

17:12.164 --> 17:14.332
Man:
Catholic scum! You
think you can kill us?!

17:21.373 --> 17:23.341
(shouts)

17:25.744 --> 17:29.714
Francis:
<i>The newest attacks were</i>
<i>by protestants?</i>

17:29.716 --> 17:31.115
What provoked them?

17:31.117 --> 17:32.583
We did.
How?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.352
When we tried to find out

17:34.354 --> 17:36.287
If condÃ©'s nephew threw
the rock at that stable boy,

17:36.289 --> 17:37.622
Protestants thought you
were investigating the victim

17:37.624 --> 17:39.123
Instead of the men
who killed him.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.292
Believing their king had
no interest in justice,

17:41.294 --> 17:42.794
They took justice
into their own hands.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.362
And the catholic reprisals?

17:44.364 --> 17:47.065
Being planned as we speak.
Revenge on revenge.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.699
Enough. I want those
protestant rioters arrested.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.368
Anyone guilty
of violence will be punished,

17:50.370 --> 17:51.769
No matter what their faith.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.371
Be careful, francis.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.706
Punishing equal crimes equally--
it's a lovely idea,

17:55.708 --> 17:57.375
But no one will
thank you for it.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.177
Not the catholics
who'll wonder

17:59.179 --> 18:01.179
Why are you hanging men
of your own faith,

18:01.181 --> 18:02.713
And not the protestants
who will forget

18:02.715 --> 18:06.284
All about your just rule when
they gain power and decide

18:06.286 --> 18:08.352
They want yours.
Arrest them all.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.855
All the rioters.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.160
If you're such good catholics,
tell the truth.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.129
You claim witnesses told you

18:18.131 --> 18:19.730
My nephew threw a rock
at a village parish.

18:19.732 --> 18:23.367
That this was the cause
of the injured boy's wounds.

18:23.369 --> 18:27.305
Do you know what'll happen when
we prove you lied to the crown?

18:27.307 --> 18:28.739
You're going to hang.

18:28.741 --> 18:31.709
It's what happened.
The story's true.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.711
Louis, that's enough.

18:33.713 --> 18:37.849
Lord condÃ© tells me the injured
boy isn't even from the village.

18:37.851 --> 18:41.786
If that's true, then you found
the boy hurt already and

18:41.788 --> 18:44.322
Made up some story about
how he was wounded, or...

18:44.324 --> 18:48.192
Or they crushed the poor
stable boy's skull themselves.

18:48.194 --> 18:50.294
To save their own.
That ain't true.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.729
Shut up, jerome.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.831
They can't
prove anything.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.567
Oh. Yes we can.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.703
I've sent for a man from the
village marc actually came from.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.371
When he gets here, we'll know

19:00.373 --> 19:02.473
If my nephew threw that rock.
If he didn't...

19:02.475 --> 19:04.609
Confess, and you may yet
have mercy, jerome.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.477
Don't lose your head.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.446
Why show them mercy?
Let them hang!

19:08.448 --> 19:09.614
If you've not only
murdered but lied

19:09.616 --> 19:11.582
To your king
to conceal your crimes,

19:11.584 --> 19:13.584
Your punishment
won't be hanging.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.287
You'll be drawn
and quartered, alive.

19:16.289 --> 19:19.824
It was luc's idea.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.926
We found that simpleton
over in val d'sud.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.862
He got kicked by a
horse there last week.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.432
Luc-- he said
it was righteous for us

19:28.434 --> 19:29.867
To use his
misfortune.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.436
He said it was
god's gift to us,

19:32.438 --> 19:33.738
To help us do
his holy work.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.840
So you beat my nephew
to death for no reason.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.642
We had plenty of reason.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.744
He was the devil's
own servant,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.412
A godless protestant.

19:41.414 --> 19:42.947
(gasps)

19:55.260 --> 19:57.762
Kenna:
It's baking.
When will it cool down?

19:57.764 --> 19:59.764
Greer:
Where's mary?
I haven't seen her all day.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.766
That's because your eyes
have been glued to that book.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.435
Mary will find us.
She wouldn't miss

20:04.437 --> 20:06.270
Your last day
as an unmarried woman.

20:06.272 --> 20:09.273
Yes, your last hours of
freedom before you become

20:09.275 --> 20:11.842
An utterly respectable
and disgustingly wealthy

20:11.844 --> 20:13.811
Mother of four.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.279
Lola:
Kenna, what
are you doing?

20:15.281 --> 20:16.781
It's too hit, I'm cooling off.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.982
Is it cold?

20:17.984 --> 20:20.685
It's heaven.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.389
â™ª I think that it's time

20:25.391 --> 20:28.926
â™ª that we find
what we're looking for... â™ª

20:28.928 --> 20:30.361
Greer.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.330
(laughing)

20:32.332 --> 20:33.231
Greer, your dress.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.966
Oh, no. Your dress.

20:34.968 --> 20:38.369
(laughter)

20:44.943 --> 20:46.544
Are you all right?

20:46.546 --> 20:49.580
I'm just drenched.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.250
I should change
before my mother finds me.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.884
You should hurry because I think

20:53.886 --> 20:56.721
I see her coming.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.856
â™ª ooh.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.559
Leith:
Greer.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.761
You look, uh...

21:03.763 --> 21:06.831
Like a drowned rat. I know.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.769
Actually, you look
quite trouble-free.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.604
Excuse me.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.040
Uh, castleroy hasn't spoken
to you, I take it?

21:16.042 --> 21:18.576
I-I should go.

21:18.578 --> 21:19.977
Wait.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.913
Greer, there are things you need
to know about castleroy.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.815
Secrets that he should tell you.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.450
Why are you telling me this?

21:26.452 --> 21:29.053
For more than one reason,
if I'm honest.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.655
Ask castleroy
about this morning.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.590
Before
you marry him.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.358
For yourself,

21:34.360 --> 21:36.594
Not for me.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.338
(grunts)

21:54.513 --> 21:56.414
Francis:
Oh, dear lord.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.951
It still fits me.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.054
I'm not sure if it fits you.

22:03.056 --> 22:05.089
Take her to the infirmary.
Quickly and quietly.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.957
I'll be there soon.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.902
That was the duke of orleans.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.538
Who languishes at the
bottom of the ratings.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.873
I've found the man that
catherine said is the one.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.008
Lord aris?
Yes, he's over there

22:24.010 --> 22:25.443
Talking to that lustful
little countess.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.711
So go. Talk to him

22:26.713 --> 22:28.012
Before she drags him
off to her chambers.

22:28.014 --> 22:30.381
And do what?
See if he has the mark?

22:30.383 --> 22:32.983
And then what?
I was just curious to know
who the mystery man was.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.052
Kenna:
You wanted to see that if you
were to have a fling,

22:35.054 --> 22:38.589
That it would be worth it.
Just talk to him. See if
there's more to him than...

22:38.591 --> 22:41.125
Everything we know.
Exactly. So go.

22:45.397 --> 22:47.565
Why am I here?

22:47.567 --> 22:50.067
What am I doing here?

22:50.069 --> 22:52.670
Who am I speaking to?

22:52.672 --> 22:54.939
Caroline?

22:54.941 --> 22:56.640
Or is this my father?

22:56.642 --> 22:59.877
I've been trapped
in this half-mad diaper maid,

22:59.879 --> 23:02.880
And do you know why?

23:02.882 --> 23:06.150
I've been trying to figure out
how I died.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.152
Who killed me.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.721
Father?
I pieced it
together,

23:10.723 --> 23:12.656
Francis, and now I know.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.392
That's why I left you that gift.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.660
The bit of the lance
that was left in my eye.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.662
If it's really you in there,

23:18.664 --> 23:21.499
I want you to leave
this poor woman alone.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.900
Find peace, father.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.835
There's no peace
for me.

23:24.837 --> 23:27.004
Not while my killer walks free.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.672
If you're here to lay blame,

23:28.674 --> 23:31.008
Then at least be honest
and shoulder your own.

23:31.010 --> 23:34.044
You murdered girls who had the
misfortune of sleeping with you.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.447
You slaughtered hundreds,
heroes of calais,

23:36.449 --> 23:38.849
For your own amusement.
You were mad.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.151
You lusted for power,

23:40.153 --> 23:42.686
For England, for scotland,
for my wife!

23:42.688 --> 23:45.456
You justify your sin
but you don't admit it.

23:45.458 --> 23:47.458
You couldn't have England
and scotland without her.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.093
You couldn't have her
unless I was gone.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.929
Admit it.
Admit you wanted me dead.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.197
Is that why you did it?

23:53.199 --> 23:55.433
Is that why you killed me?

23:55.435 --> 23:56.700
Yes!

23:56.702 --> 23:59.537
Yes.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.072
It nearly destroyed me
to kill my own father,

24:02.074 --> 24:03.507
But you left me no choice.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.042
(man clears throat)

24:08.113 --> 24:10.481
Narcisse.
You were
behaving

24:10.483 --> 24:12.716
So strangely outside.
You seemed so upset.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.084
I wish that
I had not

24:14.086 --> 24:16.086
Followed you here.
I wish that I hadn't seen

24:16.088 --> 24:17.822
Or heard

24:17.824 --> 24:19.790
This moment.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.058
But I did.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.034
Keep her under lock and key.
No one is to speak to her.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.469
Understood?

24:37.976 --> 24:39.777
You're not going anywhere.

24:44.516 --> 24:47.518
You're thinking that if I were
my father you'd be dead by now.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.153
But apparently
you're not your father.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.056
You went one better than henry
by killing him.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.058
Against my word,
all you have are the rantings

24:54.060 --> 24:56.060
Of a deranged woman.
Whom you are locking up,

24:56.062 --> 24:57.895
So no one may hear
what she has to say.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.196
As well
you should.

24:59.198 --> 25:01.165
Because in truth,

25:01.167 --> 25:03.567
No rumor could be as dangerous.

25:03.569 --> 25:06.570
Regicide-- it's-it's a crime
against France, against god.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.205
Anyone
who commits it--

25:08.207 --> 25:11.075
Or even knows of it--
could be summarily put to death.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.810
Man or woman, king...

25:14.112 --> 25:15.112
...Or queen.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.814
Which I imagine

25:16.816 --> 25:18.249
Is why your queen knows nothing

25:18.251 --> 25:20.184
Of this.
There is nothing
for her to know.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.019
And there
never will be.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.787
I understand perfectly.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.856
Do you?
I am a catholic lord,
dependent on the strength

25:25.858 --> 25:29.193
Of my catholic king.
At a time when protestants

25:29.195 --> 25:32.029
Fight to take land and power
from people like me.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.998
Like us.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.034
Why would I want
to help my enemies?

25:37.036 --> 25:40.170
Will you trust me, my king?

25:41.206 --> 25:43.741
Or will you kill me?

25:44.876 --> 25:48.045
It seems
those are your only options.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.122
Then perhaps...

25:58.124 --> 26:00.124
You are not
your father after all.

26:00.126 --> 26:04.695
As long as I'm never given
a reason to be.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.272
I was at the protestant service
this morning,

26:15.274 --> 26:17.775
Where we were attacked.
That's where you were hurt.

26:17.777 --> 26:20.110
Are you
secretly protestant?

26:20.112 --> 26:21.979
Ever since yvette died, I've
been trying to find something

26:21.981 --> 26:23.180
To help me through it,

26:23.182 --> 26:25.883
To make sense of why
she was taken from us.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.217
So I started going to services.

26:27.219 --> 26:30.120
(sighs)
when were you going to tell me?

26:30.122 --> 26:33.791
I was looking for the right
moment, but you were so happy.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.659
What if I asked you not
to do this?

26:35.661 --> 26:37.261
Don't convert.
For your safety

26:37.263 --> 26:39.296
And mine and the children.

26:39.298 --> 26:42.967
For what it could do
to our lives if people knew.
(sighs)

26:44.636 --> 26:46.637
Greer, I love you.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.173
But if you asked me to
give up what I believe,

26:49.175 --> 26:51.008
I don't think I
could marry you.

26:51.010 --> 26:54.745
And to be fair
to you, if you...

26:54.747 --> 26:57.815
If you choose to end this now,
know that I will still take care

26:57.817 --> 26:59.783
Of your sisters
and fund their dowries.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.387
Aloysius, that's too much.
I want to.

27:03.389 --> 27:06.857
But if you do choose
to be my wife, I promise you

27:06.859 --> 27:08.859
You will be
my full partner

27:08.861 --> 27:11.195
In raising our family
and managing my holdings,

27:11.197 --> 27:12.830
In making all the decisions
that touch us.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.031
Not all.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.199
We won't always agree,

27:15.201 --> 27:17.768
But I will always
listen to you,

27:17.770 --> 27:19.370
As you've listened to me.

27:21.339 --> 27:24.775
I hope I will see you
at the altar tomorrow.

27:31.916 --> 27:34.718
Mary:
I keep losing you
in the castle.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.186
Have you been hiding from me?

27:36.188 --> 27:39.023
Of course not. What is it?

27:39.025 --> 27:41.325
Have you considered what I told
you about condÃ©'s nephew?

27:41.327 --> 27:44.028
He didn't throw the stone
like narcisse claimed.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.362
Those men murdered him to prove

27:45.364 --> 27:46.964
That no protestant,
even a highborn, is safe.

27:46.966 --> 27:49.767
I've thought of little else.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.102
I know you're concerned for the
mood of your catholic majority,

27:52.104 --> 27:54.271
But I still think
the simplest solution

27:54.273 --> 27:56.273
Is the best one: Equal justice

27:56.275 --> 27:59.410
For all. The protestant rioters
must be punished.

27:59.412 --> 28:02.680
And the catholic murderers
must be hanged. And quickly.

28:02.682 --> 28:05.716
Before angry men take justice
into their own hands again.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.051
You're right.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.753
I will rule in the morning.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.858
What is it?

28:14.860 --> 28:16.827
It's the nanny, your majesty.
She's gone

28:16.829 --> 28:18.228
From her cell.
But how?

28:18.230 --> 28:20.030
Apparently lord narcisse
released her.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.232
He told the guards
it was on your orders.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.205
Francis, is
something wrong?

28:32.977 --> 28:35.879
Francis.

28:39.184 --> 28:41.385
I was expecting you.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.388
But I wasn't entirely sure
you'd come alone.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.391
I should have killed you,
it's true.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.727
But why would I now when I
know that you have caroline?

28:49.729 --> 28:51.829
Mm.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.363
That's why you
released her.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.898
To protect her from me.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.034
Because
now I know

28:57.036 --> 28:59.036
This was all your doing,
wasn't it?

28:59.038 --> 29:01.939
From beginning to end.
She was always in your service,

29:01.941 --> 29:05.776
Playacting, coaxing some kind
of admission from me.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.010
Yes.

29:07.012 --> 29:09.279
I also have montgomery.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.482
He's in a safe place,
far from any man's reach,

29:11.484 --> 29:14.184
Ready to tell the world
that he didn't kill your father

29:14.186 --> 29:18.422
If I give the word
or if anything happens to me.

29:20.792 --> 29:24.128
What made you even suspicious
of him in the first place?
Certain generals

29:24.130 --> 29:26.864
Remembered you plotting a failed
coup against your father

29:26.866 --> 29:28.499
Just hours before he died.

29:28.501 --> 29:30.300
I began to investigate.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.503
The pieces fell into place.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.138
Does it not concern you
that this plot

29:34.140 --> 29:36.140
Of yours hangs on nothing
but hearsay

29:36.142 --> 29:39.843
And supposition? There is
no physical proof of anything.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.412
Perhaps I need more
to convict you, it's true.

29:42.414 --> 29:45.115
But I only need to weaken you.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.185
I only need to stop your allies
rallying to you.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.054
And I have plenty for that.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.290
Especially after you mismanaged
your early rule,

29:53.292 --> 29:55.425
Pushing your nobles away.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.861
What do you want?

29:57.863 --> 29:59.329
My crown?

29:59.331 --> 30:00.964
Is this all
for power?

30:00.966 --> 30:02.800
I don't want your crown.

30:02.802 --> 30:05.469
I want what I had
when your father still lived:

30:05.471 --> 30:07.504
I want a ruler
who listened to reason.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.306
You mean a ruler
who listened to you?!

30:09.308 --> 30:14.044
Yes! Because what I want is
what is best for France.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.547
You and mary,
with all your ideals,

30:16.549 --> 30:19.316
Will destroy this country.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.984
In the name of justice
and tolerance,

30:20.986 --> 30:23.353
You will drive your people
to civil war.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.323
How will blackmailing me
prevent civil war?!

30:26.325 --> 30:29.193
Well, to begin with,
you will release the man

30:29.195 --> 30:30.561
Who killed condÃ©'s nephew.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.362
I can't!

30:32.364 --> 30:34.932
I have already shared my plans
to prosecute them.

30:34.934 --> 30:38.335
With mary? Explain to her
that you have changed your mind.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.337
And make sure
she believes you,

30:40.339 --> 30:43.874
Because if the people learn
that you killed your father,

30:43.876 --> 30:45.843
They will never believe
your queen didn't know it.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.511
Your heads will be on

30:47.513 --> 30:50.247
Two pikes side by side.

30:50.249 --> 30:54.117
I know you're both
very romantic,

30:54.119 --> 30:56.587
But I doubt this is the future
together you had in mind.

31:04.295 --> 31:07.064
Francis, why? We spoke
of this only hours ago.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.967
I simply changed my mind.
You will only

31:09.969 --> 31:12.536
Inflame the protestants further.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.905
The violence
will get worse!

31:14.907 --> 31:21.278
Yes, and I heard your opinion,
and I... I simply disagree.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.947
The burning of catholic shops
is not my opinion.

31:23.949 --> 31:27.251
The murder of that protestant
boy was <i>not</i> my opinion!

31:27.253 --> 31:29.386
Mary, I have already
made my decision.

31:29.388 --> 31:33.290
I'm informing the court now in
writing, before greer's wedding.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.126
My people will know of my
decision before the day's end.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.128
<i>Your</i> people?

31:38.130 --> 31:39.997
I thought we were
to rule together.

31:39.999 --> 31:43.000
At our coronation, you said
we would rule as a partnership.

31:43.002 --> 31:46.136
Mary, I can't always
be your husband first.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.638
Sometimes I have to be king.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.506
Francis, this isn't like you.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.141
Tell me what's

31:51.143 --> 31:53.410
Going on,
what's wrong.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.511
We have to get
to greer's wedding.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.446
Francis!

32:11.629 --> 32:14.531
Honestly, is greer
drawing out the suspense

32:14.533 --> 32:16.700
To make a grander entrance?

32:16.702 --> 32:20.070
Will she be arriving
on flying swans?

32:20.072 --> 32:22.105
Excuse me.

32:22.107 --> 32:25.976
â™ª waking up for the first time

32:25.978 --> 32:28.178
â™ª in your eyes
I see my bloodline â™ª

32:28.180 --> 32:30.948
â™ª your heart's on fire...

32:30.950 --> 32:33.250
Kenna and I went to wish
greer luck this morning,

32:33.252 --> 32:36.620
And she wouldn't see us.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.493
â™ª breathing in
for the first time â™ª

32:43.495 --> 32:45.662
â™ª your lungs fill up

32:45.664 --> 32:50.634
â™ª with all the life
of heart's desire â™ª

32:50.636 --> 32:54.571
â™ª this heart's on fire

32:57.108 --> 32:59.743
â™ª whoa-oh-oh-oh

32:59.745 --> 33:03.714
â™ª you're the rising sun

33:03.716 --> 33:05.315
â™ª whoa-oh-oh

33:05.317 --> 33:09.419
â™ª you're my setting sun

33:09.421 --> 33:11.521
â™ª whoa-oh-oh-oh

33:11.523 --> 33:15.125
â™ª you're the rising sun

33:15.127 --> 33:17.361
â™ª whoa-oh-oh

33:17.363 --> 33:21.565
â™ª you're my setting sun

33:21.567 --> 33:24.234
â™ª whoa-oh-oh

33:24.236 --> 33:27.738
â™ª may the love come down

33:27.740 --> 33:31.308
â™ª let me hear you say

33:31.310 --> 33:35.512
â™ª that you've found your way.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.415
We were out
on the ocean, sailing,

33:38.417 --> 33:41.284
And a school of dolphins
swam up all around us.

33:41.286 --> 33:42.619
Really?
Now,

33:42.621 --> 33:44.187
They were so close, so wild,

33:44.189 --> 33:45.722
And one of them raised its head

33:45.724 --> 33:47.691
And looked at me
as if he could

33:47.693 --> 33:49.126
Say something.

33:49.128 --> 33:51.161
Uh, sorry.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.529
Uh, what a wonder.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.098
And what would he have
said, if he could?

33:55.100 --> 33:57.434
"I understand more
than you think,

33:57.436 --> 33:59.803
And it thrills me to see you."

33:59.805 --> 34:04.074
Lady lola, I can't
promise dolphins,

34:04.076 --> 34:06.276
But is there any chance

34:06.278 --> 34:08.678
I could take you out
sailing tomorrow?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.347
Lola.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.482
I've been meaning
to congratulate you.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.284
Magnificent christening
of your son.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.719
Baron john phillip.

34:15.721 --> 34:18.388
The king was beaming,
so proud of his son.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.090
Aris:
Oh, I didn't realize.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.792
You're the mother
of the new baron.

34:21.794 --> 34:24.394
That's me, one and the same.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.396
Well, let me offer
my congratulations, as well.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.198
And I must apologize.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.500
It slipped my memory.
I'm leaving

34:30.502 --> 34:32.335
At first light,
so, sadly,

34:32.337 --> 34:34.638
I should retire.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.377
What was that
piece of theater?

34:40.379 --> 34:42.212
You deliberately
drove him away.

34:42.214 --> 34:44.347
I deliberately saved you
valuable time and energy.

34:44.349 --> 34:47.117
Aris doesn't have
the mettle for you.

34:47.119 --> 34:50.821
Other men will be afraid
of getting close to you

34:50.823 --> 34:53.123
Because they see you
as the king's property.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.459
Oh, I don't see you like that.

34:55.461 --> 34:58.662
But unlike most men,
I'm not afraid of the king.

34:58.664 --> 35:02.099
In fact, I suspect francis is
somewhat afraid of me.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.400
Oh, so am I.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.235
And men are afraid of you,

35:05.237 --> 35:07.504
So we're both feared.

35:07.506 --> 35:09.473
Can be quite isolating,
can't it?

35:10.708 --> 35:13.577
It can leave one... Lonely.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.479
That's presumptuous of you.

35:15.481 --> 35:16.847
And yet it's true.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.284
So, why don't we get
to know one another?

35:21.286 --> 35:23.420
What?

35:23.422 --> 35:24.654
Over tea.
Tea?

35:24.656 --> 35:26.289
You don't like tea?

35:26.291 --> 35:27.424
I don't like <i>you.</i>

35:27.426 --> 35:28.658
You don't know me.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.661
I know a little.
Well, that's more than most.

35:32.597 --> 35:36.133
A very... Odd but kind offer.

35:36.135 --> 35:38.301
Regrettably, I must decline.

35:38.303 --> 35:42.439
Well, it's an open invitation.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.442
Xavier, you old ghost.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.277
Lola:
The butterfly.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.612
Where have you been
hiding yourself?

35:48.614 --> 35:50.180
Come.

35:56.554 --> 35:58.788
I was certain
I'd been abandoned.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.490
What changed you?

36:00.492 --> 36:06.530
I've spent my life grasping
for security, safety.

36:06.532 --> 36:08.365
I've lived in fear
of the future,

36:08.367 --> 36:10.400
Of what people
might think of me

36:10.402 --> 36:11.701
And how that could help

36:11.703 --> 36:13.570
Or hurt me and my family.

36:13.572 --> 36:17.407
But you offer something
more interesting,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.776
Something more challenging.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.546
You stand by your convictions
and principles,

36:22.548 --> 36:24.548
You strive to make the world
what it should be,

36:24.550 --> 36:26.583
Not insulate yourself from it.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.785
I will protect you.

36:28.787 --> 36:30.587
And I you.

36:37.428 --> 36:39.663
(laughing)

36:49.507 --> 36:51.341
I love you.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.712
I need you to know that.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.481
I do.

36:58.483 --> 36:59.950
And I want to support you.

36:59.952 --> 37:02.419
As your wife,
as your queen.

37:02.421 --> 37:04.788
But I can't understand why
you would let the murderers

37:04.790 --> 37:06.356
Of that boy walk free.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.824
You know
that this a larger issue.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.860
I understand that we have
to bow to catholic nobles

37:10.862 --> 37:12.662
Who pretend to bow to us.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.998
My own nation has fallen
to protestantism.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.801
But you could have held
those catholics accountable.

37:17.803 --> 37:20.537
What they did is only going
to inflame the protestants.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.005
I can't talk about this anymore.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.506
He was just a boy.

37:23.508 --> 37:24.975
Mary, stop.
The nephew

37:24.977 --> 37:26.376
Of your friend, your cousin.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.744
The decision is made,
it is done.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.279
I am begging you to let it go.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.682
Why can't we discuss this?
We used to.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.284
It's not always possible.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.552
Why, in this instance,

37:35.554 --> 37:37.988
Is that the case?
What has changed?

37:37.990 --> 37:39.756
Francis,
what aren't you telling me?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.858
It is a choice I made as king.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.727
A choice
that we discussed thoroughly.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.528
You just don't agree with it.

37:45.530 --> 37:47.731
There's something else going on.

37:47.733 --> 37:49.699
Lately you've been
distant,

37:49.701 --> 37:53.370
Acting as though
you're haunted by something.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.705
I need peace

37:55.707 --> 37:57.374
And quiet.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.276
You need to trust me!

37:59.278 --> 38:00.610
To share
things with me.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.946
Not everything can be solved
by talking,

38:02.948 --> 38:04.681
By love, by you.

38:04.683 --> 38:08.585
There are things we cannot
change, that cannot be undone.

38:08.587 --> 38:10.487
Things that I don't tell you
to protect you.

38:10.489 --> 38:11.855
Protect me from what?!

38:11.857 --> 38:13.957
I have already said too much.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.293
You have said
far too little!

38:16.295 --> 38:17.761
Mary, please.
What could possibly

38:17.763 --> 38:19.629
Endanger me so much
that I shouldn't know about it?

38:19.631 --> 38:20.964
Don't.

38:20.966 --> 38:22.666
What is this mystery threat

38:22.668 --> 38:23.867
That somehow involves
your son's nanny,

38:23.869 --> 38:25.468
That has you skulking
around the castle

38:25.470 --> 38:27.570
At odd hours?

38:28.739 --> 38:30.940
Something I can't fix.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.677
Something that
you can't change.

38:33.679 --> 38:36.379
These secret visits
to your son...

38:36.381 --> 38:38.315
And the baby
that I lost...

38:38.317 --> 38:41.384
You worry that I can't do it.

38:43.387 --> 38:45.322
Do you worry
that I can't bear you a child?

38:45.324 --> 38:47.057
Yes.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.992
I worry because,

38:48.994 --> 38:50.660
As a king and a man,
I want heirs.

38:50.662 --> 38:52.062
Is that what you want to hear?

38:52.064 --> 38:54.030
Does it bring us closer
for you to know that

38:54.032 --> 38:57.400
Your failure disappoints me
beyond words?

39:01.405 --> 39:03.773
Have I answered you fully?

39:03.775 --> 39:06.609
Are we done with this
relentless interrogation?

39:06.611 --> 39:09.579
You told me
you hadn't lost hope.

39:09.581 --> 39:12.382
I lied.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.753
Mary, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have.

39:16.755 --> 39:18.955
I wish...

39:18.957 --> 39:21.591
For something
that I can't give you.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.364
But I asked you for the truth,

39:27.366 --> 39:29.866
And you certainly gave it to me.

39:31.469 --> 39:33.670
I don't need to hear any more.
