WEBVTT

00:05.500 --> 00:06.417
All right, guys.

00:06.792 --> 00:08.625
This is what we've been practicing for.

00:09.083 --> 00:12.667
This defining moment
will make or break our band.

00:13.041 --> 00:14.041
Milton's right.

00:14.125 --> 00:17.375
We gotta play
like we've never played before.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.583
What are they doing?

00:25.625 --> 00:28.583
The school cut funding for their club,
so they're trying to raise money.

00:28.667 --> 00:31.166
They'd probably make more money
if they stopped playing.

00:32.041 --> 00:33.959
Guys, you are not gonna believe it.

00:34.041 --> 00:35.250
Donnie Parker is moving.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.375
Do you know what that means?

00:36.667 --> 00:37.709
Yes, I do.

00:37.792 --> 00:39.625
He's not gonna be living here anymore.

00:41.291 --> 00:43.917
No, it means the coolest band in school,
the Gutter Rats,

00:44.000 --> 00:45.333
are gonna be looking for a new member.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.417
They're the favorites to win
next week's battle of the bands,

00:47.500 --> 00:49.875
and I'm auditioning
to be their lead guitarist tomorrow.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.709
You know, I might audition, too.

00:52.166 --> 00:53.709
Jerry, you can't play the guitar.

00:53.792 --> 00:54.875
And you can't dance, Kim,

00:54.959 --> 00:57.333
but that doesn't stop your little
freak show every year at the prom.

01:01.667 --> 01:03.792
All right, guys.
Let's see how much we made.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.375
Eighteen cents, two apple cores,
and a note that says...

01:15.291 --> 01:17.667
"Please don't ever play music again."

01:18.583 --> 01:20.000
Kids can be so hurtful.

01:20.083 --> 01:21.792
That was from our music teacher.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.375
We have to figure out a way to raise money
for our classical music club.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.542
I know. We desperately need
new instruments.

02:18.625 --> 02:20.333
That piccolo used to be
a piece of plumbing

02:20.417 --> 02:22.041
from the sink in the faculty lounge.

02:28.166 --> 02:29.709
All right, guys. Clear out.

02:29.834 --> 02:32.041
Time for some real musicians
to use the room.

02:32.625 --> 02:35.375
Uh, for your information,
we are real musicians.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.750
Then why is he playing something
that used to be part of a toilet?

02:37.834 --> 02:39.917
You said it came from the sink!

02:46.291 --> 02:47.208
Hey, Jack.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.542
Why are you here?

02:48.625 --> 02:50.083
I'm here to audition for the Gutter Rats.

02:50.166 --> 02:52.333
- Why don't you stick around?
- Oh, I'm not allowed to.

02:52.417 --> 02:55.250
My mother says rock music
will give me the naughty thoughts.

02:56.750 --> 02:57.834
But good luck.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.041
Okay. Let's do this.

03:02.625 --> 03:04.458
Jack Brewer, you're up first.

03:04.542 --> 03:06.500
You got 15 seconds to blow me away, dude.

03:18.125 --> 03:19.291
Okay, thanks, Jack.

03:20.792 --> 03:21.792
You can leave.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.709
Oh, so I should probably just go then?

03:27.333 --> 03:28.542
And when you get out there,

03:28.583 --> 03:30.500
tell the rest of those guys to go home.

03:31.542 --> 03:32.959
Because you're our new lead guitarist.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.417
What? Oh, dude, are you kidding me?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.709
- That's awesome!
- Dude, dude.

03:37.834 --> 03:39.166
You're a Gutter Rat now.

03:40.375 --> 03:41.375
You gotta be cool.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.458
I mean, yeah. That's, that's pretty cool.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.500
With your help, we're gonna win
the battle of the bands

03:47.583 --> 03:49.083
and the $1,000 prize.

03:49.208 --> 03:50.875
Plus, we just found out

03:50.959 --> 03:53.625
the celebrity judge is Izzy Gunnar
from Kung Fu Lightning.

03:53.709 --> 03:55.709
Izzy Gunnar, I know him! I'm...

03:57.500 --> 03:58.875
I mean, whatever, dude.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.208
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

04:03.291 --> 04:05.667
Rudy, calm down. You're overreacting.

04:05.750 --> 04:06.917
It's just a typo.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.166
The ad you sold me
in your school newspaper

04:09.250 --> 04:10.333
was supposed to read

04:10.458 --> 04:13.375
"lifetime membership
for three people."

04:13.458 --> 04:14.709
Uh, what does that say?

04:15.125 --> 04:17.166
"Lifetime membership for free, people."

04:19.125 --> 04:21.417
Well, dude, you trusted me
with spelling, words, and numbers.

04:21.500 --> 04:22.709
What good could come from that?

04:23.625 --> 04:25.375
High school almost ruined my life once.

04:25.458 --> 04:27.000
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.625
I need my squeezy stress balls.

04:30.709 --> 04:32.041
Rudy, Rudy, I took care of it.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.667
I got down to the school
at 5:00 this morning

04:33.750 --> 04:35.875
and grabbed every newspaper
before they went out.

04:35.959 --> 04:37.375
You see that, Rudy?

04:37.458 --> 04:38.583
There's no problem.

04:38.667 --> 04:39.959
Kim got every copy.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.750
Not every copy!

04:44.041 --> 04:47.041
I'm here for my lifetime membership
for free, people.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.166
And that's gonna be a while.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.542
My grandpa's 114,
and he lives with his father.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.250
You don't think
the snorkel's a little overkill?

05:11.250 --> 05:12.583
No, I don't, Milton.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.959
You know, a person can drown
in three inches of water.

05:17.542 --> 05:20.625
I danced with death last summer
in my grandmother's bird bath.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.583
Carol and Darcy are back again.

05:27.375 --> 05:28.417
They don't even have bikes.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.000
Oh. Well, they're not here for the bikes.

05:30.083 --> 05:31.417
They're here for the gun show.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.250
Look at those nerds.

06:06.375 --> 06:07.917
Let's hit them with some dirt bombs.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.834
I can't do that.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.041
One of those guys is my friend,
and he's not a nerd.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.041
Really?

06:16.041 --> 06:17.625
Okay, well, I do see your point.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.875
I'm not gonna hit him with a dirt bomb.

06:19.959 --> 06:20.875
And you guys aren't either.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.917
You know what? You're right.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.166
Jack, here's a donation.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.500
Go put it in their bucket.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.667
Thanks. You see?

06:30.750 --> 06:33.041
Fellow musicians. That's more like it.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.291
Oh, thanks, Jack.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.458
Oh, no, man. It's not from me.
It's from the Gutter Rats.

06:40.542 --> 06:41.375
Oh.

06:41.917 --> 06:42.959
And so is this.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.208
- Ow!
- Oh!

06:49.125 --> 06:50.542
Oh, and Jack?

06:50.625 --> 06:51.625
You're out of the band.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.583
- Hup.
<i>Rudy?</i>

06:58.667 --> 07:00.250
- Good job, guys.
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

07:00.333 --> 07:03.333
- Again. Again.
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy...

07:03.417 --> 07:05.166
He's a little busy, Albert!

07:06.959 --> 07:09.041
I want him to watch me hit the fake man.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.709
Bah!

07:15.208 --> 07:16.709
I think I'm getting better.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.291
You're really not.

07:18.834 --> 07:20.208
Oh, really?

07:20.542 --> 07:22.917
Well, watch what I can do with a bo staff.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.417
- Albert, Albert.
- What?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.250
Look, maybe karate just isn't your thing.

07:31.333 --> 07:32.417
Well, not yet.

07:32.500 --> 07:36.500
But I've got plenty of time to learn
because you're my sensei for life.

07:37.792 --> 07:39.667
Which means I'm here
until one of us dies--

07:39.750 --> 07:42.375
Please, let it be me!

07:48.250 --> 07:49.625
Hey, why are you guys packing up?

07:50.875 --> 07:53.375
We didn't raise enough money
to save the Classical Music Club.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.417
We only made 49 bucks
from Carol and Darcy,

07:56.500 --> 07:59.500
which, by the way,
made me feel dirtier than the dirt bombs.

08:00.250 --> 08:02.709
You're not a quitter, Milton.
You guys aren't gonna give up.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.291
What if you guys had 1,000 bucks?

08:10.125 --> 08:13.041
Well, that's what the winner
of the battle of the bands gets.

08:16.208 --> 08:17.375
Battle of the bands?

08:17.458 --> 08:18.917
Us?

08:19.709 --> 08:21.875
Come on, Jack. Sidney plays the toilet.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.667
It's true. It's true.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.125
All right, laugh all you want.

08:26.709 --> 08:28.125
If that's what that is.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.375
The Gutter Rats don't deserve to win.

08:31.458 --> 08:32.375
They're jerks.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.709
And when it comes down to it, you guys
are probably better musicians, aren't you?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.333
Well, yeah.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.208
Well, I'm gonna turn you guys
into rock stars.

08:39.583 --> 08:40.500
Who's in?

08:41.542 --> 08:42.792
Rock and roll on three.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.625
One, two, three!

08:44.709 --> 08:46.000
Rock and roll.

08:47.041 --> 08:48.125
Come on, guys.

08:48.583 --> 08:51.125
Pretend you're playing swords and magic
with a hobbit, a robot,

08:51.208 --> 08:53.208
and a warrior princess
in a golden bathing suit.

I don't know why we can't just use
the instruments we have.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.709
Instruments are like animals.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.959
And yours are the boring ones
at the petting zoo

09:10.041 --> 09:11.917
like the bunny or the little lamb.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.583
I'm gonna be a lamb for Halloween...

09:13.667 --> 09:14.583
Sidney.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.625
All we have to do
is make a few adjustments

09:17.709 --> 09:19.083
to turn you guys into rockers.

09:19.500 --> 09:20.333
Teddy,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.083
you play the kettle drums,
so we're gonna stay in percussion

09:23.166 --> 09:24.250
and give you...

09:24.834 --> 09:26.375
a rock drum kit!

09:26.667 --> 09:28.000
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

09:28.709 --> 09:29.792
Now, Sidney,

09:29.875 --> 09:32.083
we're gonna turn your cello on its side

09:32.166 --> 09:34.458
and replace it
with its cooler, hipper cousin...

09:35.333 --> 09:36.834
oh, the bass guitar.

09:37.625 --> 09:39.458
It's bedtime, Cecilia.

09:42.375 --> 09:44.000
I don't want her to see this.

09:45.667 --> 09:46.583
Milton.

09:46.667 --> 09:49.583
You can play the piano,
so we're gonna put you

09:49.667 --> 09:51.500
on the electric keyboard.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.792
I feel so...

10:06.583 --> 10:07.834
bad!

10:10.125 --> 10:13.291
Now, Oliver, you've been
classically trained to play the lute.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.875
So you're gonna get...

10:18.458 --> 10:20.291
Uh, the cowbell.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.500
- The cowbell? But--
- Cowbell!

10:25.250 --> 10:26.875
I'll play lead guitar and sing.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.458
And that's all it takes
for us to become a winning rock band?

10:30.542 --> 10:31.500
No, there's one more thing.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.583
Every rock star has his signature move.

10:33.667 --> 10:34.583
For example,

10:35.041 --> 10:36.709
Mick Jagger has his strut.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.250
David Lee Roth has his kick.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.458
It's what makes them different
from everybody else.

10:44.333 --> 10:45.750
Oh, we got this.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.041
Well, you know what?
Maybe we'll be one of those cool bands

11:31.834 --> 11:34.166
So I'm gonna make him a grandmaster.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.625
He'll think he has nothing left to learn
and he'll leave.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.333
Is this about me barfing in your locker?

11:47.083 --> 11:48.583
You barfed in my locker?

11:48.959 --> 11:49.917
No.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.709
I was reviewing your progress,

11:53.792 --> 11:56.500
and it has exceeded my expectations.

11:56.583 --> 12:00.000
So I've decided to make you a grandmaster.

12:01.834 --> 12:02.959
Wow.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.542
That's the highest of the high.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.583
Surely, there is nothing left
to teach him.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.750
You are a grandmaster now.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.458
You are a leader.

12:13.917 --> 12:16.667
Now you must go forth and lead others.

12:17.125 --> 12:20.083
We shall miss thee, oh, great one.

12:21.291 --> 12:22.166
No!

12:23.709 --> 12:26.125
Grandmaster Albert's not going anywhere.

12:27.625 --> 12:30.875
It is my duty
to lead the people of this dojo.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.709
Rudy, go clean my puke out of your locker.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.417
Jerry, put a bucket of ribs
in the shower for me.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.625
Kim-Kim? Ooh.

12:40.709 --> 12:42.583
Let's spar it up.

12:49.500 --> 12:50.542
Now listen up, guys.

12:50.625 --> 12:53.500
I got us this gig as a little warm-up
for the battle of the bands.

12:53.583 --> 12:55.750
We're gonna go out there
and kick some butt.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.125
I think I sneezed
one of my whiskers off on the bus.

13:02.333 --> 13:04.875
Yeah, I don't know
if I have the neck muscles for this wig.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.834
This is a lot of hair for a little boy.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.667
Guys, you look great. You ready to rock?

13:09.750 --> 13:10.959
Yeah. Let's do this.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.208
When we walk in there,
we walk in like rock stars.

13:14.291 --> 13:15.250
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

13:19.333 --> 13:21.125
All right, Seaford,
this is a group we put together.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.667
We call ourselves the...

13:22.750 --> 13:24.750
The Wolverines.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.125
Get ready to rock, Seaford.

13:30.792 --> 13:32.458

14:03.959 --> 14:05.250
- Uh...
-

14:09.375 --> 14:11.250
Where is the rest of the band?

14:11.709 --> 14:12.625
They're in the parking lot

14:12.709 --> 14:14.667
trying to de-wedge Milton's shoe
from the bass drum.

14:16.458 --> 14:17.291
Izzy.

14:17.375 --> 14:18.834
- Hey, hey.
- What's happening, man?

14:18.917 --> 14:20.542
- It's been a while, mate.
- Yeah.

14:20.625 --> 14:22.041
God, your hair looks good.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.917
Tough gig, though.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.583
You saw that?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.667
Unfortunately, I did.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.125
But fortunately, I hadn't eaten yet.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.166
Hey, it's not your fault, Jack.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.375
You were on stage with a bunch of posers.

14:37.458 --> 14:39.583
They're actually
really great musicians, man. I just...

14:40.917 --> 14:42.959
I tried to make them
into something that they're not.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.667
I once tried to turn a weasel
into a lap dog.

14:46.083 --> 14:47.000
Don't do it.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.375
I'm still missing part of my lap.

14:50.875 --> 14:54.166
So you're saying if they're weasels,
then I should just let them be weasels.

14:54.250 --> 14:57.959
Most rock stars are trying to be
what you say those guys already are,

14:58.417 --> 14:59.417
great musicians.

15:00.875 --> 15:02.417
Thanks, man. That's great advice.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.917
I know. Oh!

15:04.041 --> 15:05.083
One last thing.

15:06.834 --> 15:08.375
Your voice is...

15:09.208 --> 15:10.834
How do I say this nicely?

15:12.542 --> 15:13.500
It's horrible.

15:14.417 --> 15:17.333
Yeah, it's like wretchedly bad.
Just like...

15:21.375 --> 15:22.834
I thought you said you were gonna be nice?

15:22.917 --> 15:23.834
I was.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.625
But your voice made me...

15:26.250 --> 15:28.083
hate my ears.

15:30.041 --> 15:30.917
Cheers, mate.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.333
<i>♪ It's not as cool

15:39.583 --> 15:40.583
You guys okay?

15:55.458 --> 15:56.750
No, we're not okay.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.291
It's over.

16:00.375 --> 16:01.375
We failed.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.333
You guys didn't fail.

16:03.875 --> 16:04.750
I did.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.625
I tried to change you guys into rock stars

16:07.709 --> 16:10.000
instead of letting you guys
be who you really are.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.917
And I believe that we can win
the battle of the bands.

16:15.583 --> 16:16.542
Sidney.

16:19.250 --> 16:20.125
Come on, Jack.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.625
You want us to go up on stage
at battle of the bands

16:22.709 --> 16:24.000
looking like a bunch of nerds?

16:24.083 --> 16:25.125
Yes.

16:26.041 --> 16:28.542
Yes. In fact,
that's exactly what I want you to do.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.083
And all we need is a singer now.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.625
Jack, I thought you were our singer.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.166
I can't sing and we all know it.

16:34.250 --> 16:35.417
- That's true.
- You're horrible.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.583
- You stink.
- Terrible.

16:37.959 --> 16:39.083
Well, I could sing.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.041
Wait, you can sing?

16:41.083 --> 16:41.959
Yeah.

16:42.041 --> 16:44.917
Oh, I've never done it in front of people
because it's a little scary.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.083
But if we're being who we really are,
then let me bring it.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.417
Okay.

16:50.041 --> 16:51.792
And if you want,
I can do a little backup singing?

16:51.875 --> 16:52.917
Not gonna happen, Jack.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.667
- If I could just harmonize--
- He said no!

16:54.750 --> 16:56.500
So back off, hair-bag.

17:00.667 --> 17:02.458
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

17:08.875 --> 17:10.417
Do you think Rudy's new plan's gonna work?

17:11.041 --> 17:12.000
As grandmaster,

17:12.083 --> 17:14.166
it's Albert's responsibility
to protect the dojo.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.917
So when Rudy shows up
dressed like a ninja,

17:16.000 --> 17:18.375
it'll scare Albert so bad,
he'll run away and never come back.

17:24.834 --> 17:25.917
Nice commitment.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.041
Oh, no! A ninja!

17:29.750 --> 17:30.875
No.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.208
Not in my dojo!

17:33.250 --> 17:34.500
I got this, guys.

17:36.792 --> 17:37.750
Go away.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.875
I hate karate!

17:48.959 --> 17:50.625
It's the devil's yoga.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.041
I'm never coming back!

17:54.250 --> 17:56.083
Rudy, that was awesome.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.458
Did you see the look on his...

18:00.333 --> 18:01.291
Where'd Rudy go?

18:10.125 --> 18:11.083
Where's Albert?

18:11.542 --> 18:12.709
Uh, Rudy?

18:14.208 --> 18:15.458
How did you get outside?

18:16.041 --> 18:16.917
What do you mean?

18:17.333 --> 18:19.250
A second ago,
a ninja fell through the ceiling,

18:19.333 --> 18:21.458
beat the tar out of Albert,
and ran him off.

18:21.709 --> 18:22.709
Well, that wasn't me.

18:23.542 --> 18:24.750
Oh, boy.

18:26.625 --> 18:28.542
I gotta call the exterminator.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.208

20:54.000 --> 20:54.917
Oh, that was easy.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.875
Sidney did a spin move with his cello
and nailed me in the crotch.
