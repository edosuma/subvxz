WEBVTT

00:24.492 --> 00:25.826
Police, police! Don't move!

00:25.926 --> 00:26.960
Don't move!

00:27.861 --> 00:30.098
Cut the engine. Keep your hands
where we can see 'em.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.933
Get out. Get out.
Hands on the car.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.569
That's the third luxury
car that's been stolen

00:35.669 --> 00:36.804
in this neighborhood in
the past ten days.

00:36.904 --> 00:37.671
You've been busy.

00:37.771 --> 00:38.772
I got nothing to say.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.508
Better think of
something fast.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.775
Come on,
let's take a ride.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.011
Come on. Let's go.
We'll take our car.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.594
We got a report of an armed
robbery at this location?

01:00.694 --> 01:01.995
This man came in
demanding money.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.198
And you apprehended
him yourself?

01:04.298 --> 01:05.833
No, the officer did.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.401
What officer?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.237
A policeman came in
right after I called.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.904
He grabbed the man,
took his gun,

01:11.004 --> 01:11.972
and tied him up.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.474
Was he wearing a uniform?
No.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.409
But he had a gun and badge.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.178
Well, where's the cop now?

01:17.278 --> 01:18.279
He left.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.913
Said he had another call.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.751
Less police work for us.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.587
Let's take
this clown in.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.929
Hey.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.366
Looks like you saw
something scary.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.302
I did. Me.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.903
Media training.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.838
I'm supposed to watch myself
give a speech

01:44.938 --> 01:47.241
and then critique the delivery.

01:47.341 --> 01:48.976
That sounds smart.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.445
It's completely unnecessary.
I've delivered hundreds

01:51.545 --> 01:53.281
of closing arguments
in front of a jury,

01:53.381 --> 01:54.915
with damn good conviction rate.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.218
Yeah, but when
you're a candidate,

01:57.318 --> 01:59.320
you're the one that's on trial.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.856
In an election,
the public is the jury.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.393
And most of them vote for
the candidate they like best.

02:05.493 --> 02:06.827
I know.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.430
But I'm not an actor.
I'm a lawyer.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.732
You want to be DA?
You got to be both.

02:12.766 --> 02:14.034
You got your speech memorized?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.236
Yes.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.137
Okay. Then do it for me.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.607
Uh, no. Forget it.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.510
Are you running or not?

02:25.045 --> 02:26.247
I hate this.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.382
Yeah, you'll live. Let's go.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.319
I'm Erin Reagan, and I'm...

02:31.419 --> 02:33.821
Okay. Stand up, please.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.196
I'm Erin Reagan, and I'm
running for district attorney.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.597
Okay, smile.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.768
Not like you're on a blind date.
Come on.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.640
My family has been fighting
crime in New York

02:52.740 --> 02:53.974
for three generations...

02:54.074 --> 02:55.643
Okay, eye contact.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.110
And slow down.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.946
Okay. Can you stop?

03:02.583 --> 03:04.585
After 16 years
on the front lines,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.621
I know how the battle
for justice is waged.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.657
As your district attorney,

03:09.757 --> 03:12.393
I will fight to keep you
and your family safe

03:12.493 --> 03:13.994
every day.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.499
Have at it.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.134
By Jove, I think you've got it.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.103
Really?

03:24.071 --> 03:25.506
Now, let's take it from the top.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.940
One more time.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.278
I'm Erin Reagan,

03:30.378 --> 03:33.314
and I want to be your
district attorney.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.385
As you were.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.923
Do you have update
on our officer, Paul?

03:43.023 --> 03:44.292
In surgery.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.526
That's all I know.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.361
Sit down.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.162
You've got
a long day ahead of you.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.834
What's the damage?

03:53.934 --> 03:55.736
Took one in the upper thigh.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.471
Missed
the femoral artery.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.039
Docs are optimistic.

03:59.139 --> 04:02.343
Well, at least
that's promising news.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.577
What happened?

04:03.677 --> 04:05.212
Perp jumped
the turnstile.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.213
Douglas grabbed him.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.348
Perp pulled a gun.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.317
And our officer takes a bullet

04:09.417 --> 04:12.219
over a $2.75 fare.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.390
Yeah, I'd like to talk
to his partner.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.258
Not possible.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.661
How?

04:20.761 --> 04:23.196
Officer Douglas was
on solo patrol

04:23.297 --> 04:24.832
at the time of the incident.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.768
Okay.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.604
Well, maybe this will
convince our mayor

04:30.704 --> 04:33.941
that solo patrols
increase the risk to our people.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.877
To be fair,
this incident could've occurred

04:36.977 --> 04:38.946
even if Douglas had been
with another officer.

04:39.046 --> 04:42.350
"And if one can overpower
he who is alone,

04:42.450 --> 04:43.717
two can resist him."

04:43.817 --> 04:46.219
All due respect
to the good book,

04:46.320 --> 04:49.256
in the ten days
since this program started,

04:49.357 --> 04:51.959
no officers have been
seriously injured until today.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.227
Today was inevitable, Paul.

04:55.162 --> 04:58.866
I want daily updates
on this pilot program.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.934
Yes, sir.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.841
Give it a chance.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.712
The mayor may be right
on this one.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.218
Sounds like someone's buying
what the mayor's selling.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.189
And is hawking it himself.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.954
Got a tricky situation here, Bobby.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.490
Think I might need
to talk to a lawyer.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.393
Which is your right,
but give me a second, okay?

05:59.493 --> 06:01.128
So...

06:01.228 --> 06:03.464
you've clearly moved up
in the world.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.766
Part of a bigger operation.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.835
No idea
what you're talking about.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.069
Let's say I'm right.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.337
Big shots you're working for?

06:10.438 --> 06:12.673
They're gonna let you
take the fall here.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.978
I'm low man on the totem pole
around here.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.848
So when the brown stuff
starts rolling downhill,

06:20.948 --> 06:23.016
I'm the guy it lands on.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.718
Smart move?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.454
You, uh, grab a shovel

06:26.554 --> 06:28.789
before you get buried.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.223
Not gonna happen.

06:30.323 --> 06:31.959
Fine.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.027
But know this: with your sheet,
you're looking at 15 years.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.063
And if you don't start talking,
I'm gonna recommend you serve

06:36.163 --> 06:37.965
every single day of it.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.201
Let's go.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.272
Thought I had him
for a second.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.406
A career criminal like Renner's
not gonna go

06:46.507 --> 06:47.741
for the good cop routine.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.943
Yeah,
I was gonna go at him hard.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.011
Why didn't you?

06:51.111 --> 06:52.179
Didn't want him to shut down.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.981
Which is what he did.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.348
Working Intelligence,

06:55.449 --> 06:57.217
all you got's your instincts.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.653
Got to trust your gut.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.158
Hey.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.127
I checked with communications
and the front desk.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.296
No one put that liquor
store arrest over the air.

07:09.396 --> 07:10.731
I'm sure
they'll get to it.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.900
Cop makes a collar
on a gunpoint robbery

07:13.000 --> 07:14.267
and doesn't call it in.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.536
Not our problem.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.104
That job was
assigned to us.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.438
It feels like we should
find out what happened.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.673
We know exactly
what happened.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.942
Some lowlife skel

07:22.042 --> 07:23.677
tried to commit a gunpoint
robbery and got collared.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.113
The question is:
Who made the collar?

07:26.213 --> 07:27.915
No, the question is:
Who cares?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.449
The clerk ID'd the perp.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.752
Now it's up to the DA
to prosecute. We're done.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.687
Not as far as
I'm concerned.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.788
Okay.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.557
This guy was in
plainclothes, right?

07:37.625 --> 07:38.692
So, maybe
he's a undercover

07:38.792 --> 07:40.060
who can't risk
getting made.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.395
That feels like
a long shot.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.865
If the case warrants
further investigation,

07:44.965 --> 07:48.401
well, then that's
why God made detectives.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.975
Detectives checked
out the address

07:55.075 --> 07:57.945
Renner put in the nav system
of the Mercedes he boosted.

07:58.045 --> 07:59.179
Where was he headed?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.480
High-end chop shop
near Riverdale.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.882
Mm-hmm.
Least it was,

08:01.982 --> 08:04.317
till a couple hours
before our guys showed up.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.753
Yeah, I'm sure
they got wise to it

08:05.853 --> 08:07.387
when Renner didn't
deliver the vehicle.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.823
Yeah, these guys are slick.
They steal a vehicle,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.492
then either dismantle it
or change the VIN number,

08:12.593 --> 08:14.361
and make a brand new registration.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.929
Yeah, creating
an untraceable vehicle

08:16.029 --> 08:17.164
that they can sell anywhere.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.331
Our guys found printouts

08:18.431 --> 08:19.733
of cargo ships
leaving the harbor

08:19.833 --> 08:22.435
for South America,
Europe, even Africa.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.471
So they're not just sophisticated,

08:24.572 --> 08:25.472
they're international. Yeah.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.574
Just a matter of time

08:26.674 --> 08:28.375
till they set up
a new shop.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.310
Okay, time to talk
to the boss.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.247
According to Chief Gallagher,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.149
subway crimes
ticked down last week.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.651
Well, whoop-de-doo.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.687
We had an officer
shot yesterday.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.822
So that was then,
and this is now.

08:41.922 --> 08:45.125
His summary shows solo patrols
have a positive impact.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.459
Not on my cops.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.695
Officer Douglas
will be back

08:47.795 --> 08:48.862
on the street
in a few weeks.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.531
With a partner this time. Amen.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.933
Look, a couple of millimeters

08:53.033 --> 08:54.868
from an artery
is just dumb luck,

08:54.968 --> 08:56.236
not good policy.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.671
Exactly.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.372
Mayor's office asked
when you'll be

08:59.472 --> 09:01.408
publicly endorsing the program.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.679
And you thought it was
a good idea to ask me that?

09:05.779 --> 09:07.347
It is in my job description.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.249
I approved this initiative

09:09.349 --> 09:11.551
fully expecting
the pilot program

09:11.652 --> 09:15.723
to crash and burn under
the weight of its own stupidity.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.591
Probably not the endorsement
they're looking for.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.427
'Cause it was a dumb idea,
any way you slice it.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.162
And word is,
the mayor's staff

09:22.262 --> 09:25.398
consulted Gallagher on
the viability of solo patrols.

09:25.498 --> 09:27.434
And let me guess:
Gallagher told the mayor

09:27.534 --> 09:29.369
exactly what he wanted to hear.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.004
Chapter and verse.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.774
Which makes my guy
<i>his</i> guy in this.

09:33.874 --> 09:37.077
But you're the one who speaks
for the NYPD, not him.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.446
I'd bust him down, it were me.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.082
Not that it ever would be... me.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.185
Do you get the feeling that
maybe Gallagher wouldn't mind

09:45.285 --> 09:47.087
moving into this office one day?

09:47.187 --> 09:48.856
If he ever sits in this chair,

09:48.956 --> 09:51.224
I'm gonna leave a note
in this drawer,

09:51.324 --> 09:52.860
like outgoing presidents do.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.428
It'll be very short,
very simple.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.197
Five words:

09:57.297 --> 09:59.933
"Careful what you wish for."

10:01.301 --> 10:03.603
Whoever this guy is,
he's working really hard

10:03.704 --> 10:05.038
to keep his face
off the camera.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.840
Thanks for taking a look
at this, Danny.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.341
Baez took a few vacation days,

10:08.441 --> 10:09.910
so timing couldn't be better.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.012
Well, my partner thinks
I should just drop it.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.214
But my boss said I could take it
to a detective, so...

10:14.314 --> 10:16.316
Well, you chose the right
one, because I agree.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.886
Guy not calling it in
doesn't make any sense.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.954
Right? We canvassed the whole
area. There's no sign of him.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.323
Badillo thinks he might be
undercover or off duty, but...

10:23.423 --> 10:25.558
Yeah, well, even if he is
undercover or off duty,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.494
he still has an
obligation to report

10:27.594 --> 10:28.996
the incident,
which he did not.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.363
So, what do you think
we're dealing with?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.099
Well, he doesn't
have a...

10:32.199 --> 10:33.333
cape or tights,

10:33.433 --> 10:34.902
so we can rule
out superhero.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.303
That leaves
only one thing.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.337
Which is?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.605
Police impersonator.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.073
You're kidding.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.275
No. You'd be surprised
how often it happens.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.244
I've heard of perps pretending
to be cops to take

10:44.344 --> 10:45.645
cash and drugs from dealers.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.047
Mm-hmm.
But taking down bad guys?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.816
That's a new one.
This happens so frequently,

10:48.916 --> 10:51.184
IA has a Police
Impersonator Unit.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.686
Should we take
this to them?

10:52.786 --> 10:54.421
I don't think so.
Not yet, anyway.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.156
Reagan.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.859
Where?

10:59.693 --> 11:00.928
Okay, we're on it.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.230
Bodega was just hit on 3rd.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.498
Perp was already disarmed
before the cops arrived.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.967
That's our guy. Yeah.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.502
Except this time,
a bystander was shot.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.816
Easy. Yeah, we got him.

11:22.916 --> 11:23.917
There we go.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.585
You okay?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.621
Hey. What do we got?

11:28.722 --> 11:31.591
Owner states this guy tried
to rob him at gunpoint.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.560
Until a plainclothes cop
showed up and saved the day?

11:33.660 --> 11:36.596
Yeah. Had a weapon, flashed
a shield. Took this guy down.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.598
What about the bystander?
How'd she get shot?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.567
Perp threw a shot
at the guy who intervened.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.969
Vic took one to the leg.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.036
Guy disarmed the perp,

11:43.136 --> 11:44.437
secured him with zip ties,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.139
then stopped the vic's bleeding

11:46.239 --> 11:47.474
before he took off.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.078
Mm-hmm. Okay.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.645
We got it from here.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.916
This guy pulled this twice.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.785
I'd say he's not
an undercover.

11:57.885 --> 11:58.952
Well, then, who is he?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.420
Don't know.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.322
How is he responding to calls

12:02.422 --> 12:03.623
before our people even arrive?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.492
Well, maybe
he's using a scanner.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.828
This place is three blocks
away from the liquor store,

12:07.928 --> 12:10.764
so he's coming from somewhere
in the immediate area.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.401
Starting to sound like
a detective, Officer Janko.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.203
Well, on the upside, he did save

12:16.303 --> 12:17.905
our vic from
potentially bleeding out.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.440
Yeah, but if he didn't come
in here waving a gun around,

12:20.540 --> 12:22.943
our vic may have never
gotten shot in the first place.

12:23.043 --> 12:23.977
So what do we do now?

12:24.077 --> 12:25.212
We stop this guy

12:25.312 --> 12:27.147
before someone gets killed.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.653
Hey, you wanted to see me?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.088
Close the door.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.289
What's going on?

12:36.389 --> 12:37.791
The image consultant

12:37.891 --> 12:39.692
sent a stylist.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.329
Okay, so let's take a look.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.230
No.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.098
No, I can't see?
No.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.466
I-I don't, I don't know--

12:46.566 --> 12:48.201
I don't know
if I can do this.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.103
Come on.
It's just you and me here.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.312
Wow.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.614
I know. It's a lot. Right?

13:01.714 --> 13:02.950
You look fantastic.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.084
It-It's not me.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.652
It's just, it's too much.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.587
Yeah? Well, whoever it is,
she's got my vote.

13:07.687 --> 13:08.956
I'll tell you that.

13:09.056 --> 13:11.791
I've spent my entire
professional life

13:11.892 --> 13:13.994
trying to be judged
by the way I think

13:14.094 --> 13:15.863
and not the way I look.

13:15.963 --> 13:16.997
And you've succeeded.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.231
But if you're easy on the eyes,

13:18.331 --> 13:19.266
why not use it?

13:19.366 --> 13:21.001
It's been my experience

13:21.101 --> 13:22.502
that most people
don't appreciate

13:22.602 --> 13:24.938
when people use their looks
to get ahead.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.974
No offense, that's BS.

13:27.074 --> 13:28.141
It's like with movie stars.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.676
Half the people want to be 'em.

13:29.776 --> 13:30.810
The other half want to...

13:30.911 --> 13:32.579
All right, stop.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.483
I just want people
to vote for me

13:36.583 --> 13:38.886
because I'm the best candidate.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.154
All due respect?

13:41.254 --> 13:44.191
Who the hell cares
why they vote for you?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.259
I do.
Let's face it.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.760
There's a reason
more politicians

13:47.861 --> 13:50.530
look like you than me.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.836
I do kind of like the color.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.606
Now you're talking.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.413
Looking for me, Sarge?

14:06.513 --> 14:07.247
Yeah.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.216
We got the, uh, go-ahead

14:09.316 --> 14:10.750
for an undercover op
on the car ring.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
Sweet.
Now we just got to get inside.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.188
Yeah. Actually, I already
got that part covered.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.257
Oh, yeah?

14:17.357 --> 14:18.658
I re-interviewed Renner.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.461
Leaned on him to reach
out to his bosses.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.595
Okay.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.264
I would've
brought you in,

14:24.364 --> 14:26.799
but after you go soft
on a skel like that,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.101
you can't un-ring that bell.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.869
Yeah. I get it, I get it.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.871
Renner reached out
to the head of his car ring

14:31.972 --> 14:33.206
and told him he was in the wind

14:33.306 --> 14:34.607
after a close call
with the cops.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.809
Recommended a wheelman
out of Chicago

14:36.910 --> 14:37.945
named Gary Stokes.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.779
Who the hell is Gary Stokes?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.081
You're looking at him.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.549
Created a fictitious ID,

14:42.649 --> 14:45.218
all the way down
to a juvenile arrest record.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.486
You're going undercover?

14:46.586 --> 14:48.355
Yeah, I know my way
around a car,

14:48.455 --> 14:50.757
and, uh, I've worked
my fair share of undercover ops.

14:50.857 --> 14:51.959
Could get hairy.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.726
I'm happy to take the lead.

14:53.826 --> 14:55.095
Thank you.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.329
But better you sit back,

14:56.429 --> 14:57.764
watch and learn on this one.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.467
Okay.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.971
Uh...

15:04.071 --> 15:05.505
Starting to feel like

15:05.605 --> 15:07.540
I'm letting you down here, Sarge.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.476
No.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.511
There's a learning curve
to every job.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.081
Yeah, but if you're thinking,
like, maybe this is a bad fit?

15:14.181 --> 15:16.616
No, Intelligence is different
than working the street.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.885
Maybe the street's
where I belong.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.520
Only you can decide that.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.222
But right now we're going after
a real big fish.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.556
I need you all in.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.359
Yes, sir.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.165
Terrence Simms?

15:32.265 --> 15:33.700
That's right.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.767
Detective Reagan.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.003
Officer Janko.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.104
Can I help you?

15:37.204 --> 15:38.205
Yeah. You're
security

15:38.305 --> 15:39.539
supervisor around here?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.174
Yeah. I cover four
warehouses on the block.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.475
That's kind of quiet.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.011
Guess I'm doing my job.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.812
I think what she
means is, it's kind of

15:45.912 --> 15:47.147
quiet of a job

15:47.247 --> 15:49.649
for a former NYPD detective
like yourself.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.551
Well, the money's good, and, uh,

15:51.651 --> 15:53.586
it's a hell of a lot
less dangerous.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.655
Seems like danger's something
you've been missing these days?

15:55.755 --> 15:57.924
Don't get your meaning.
What she means is,

15:58.025 --> 15:59.392
a guy fitting your description

15:59.492 --> 16:01.028
has been answering 911 calls

16:01.128 --> 16:02.362
in this neighborhood.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.264
Well, I don't know
anything about that.

16:04.364 --> 16:09.102
The lab lifted partial prints
from a zip tie in the bodega.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.637
As a former cop,
you must know

16:10.737 --> 16:13.006
your prints are
still in the system.

16:14.941 --> 16:16.443
Look,
I was just trying to help.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.910
By impersonating
a police officer?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.046
I was in the neighborhood.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.480
I keep a scanner in the office.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.515
As well as a gun
and a shield?

16:22.615 --> 16:24.884
Hey, look...
No, you look.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.421
You turned in your gun and
your shield eight months ago.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.923
Gave up all your police powers.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.362
Well, you know what they say.
Old habits.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.364
No one's saying
you didn't do some good here.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.898
But you did break the law.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.668
It's a crime to impersonate
a police officer.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.170
You got your gun
on you now?

16:43.270 --> 16:44.604
Nah. I'm clean.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.806
Good. Why don't you take
a ride with us?

16:52.445 --> 16:53.880
And last but never least,

16:53.980 --> 16:56.649
I want to thank you
for your good work,

16:56.749 --> 16:58.351
not just in fighting crime

16:58.451 --> 16:59.686
in your commands,

16:59.786 --> 17:01.988
but, just as importantly,
seeing to it that...

17:02.089 --> 17:05.758
...our officers come home safe.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.962
And, as always,

17:10.063 --> 17:12.432
that work is never done.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.636
So back to it.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.576
Stand by. Boss wants a word.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.022
Paul...

17:36.123 --> 17:39.726
...solo patrols, on the subway
or anywhere else,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.428
concern me.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.163
I gathered that.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.565
But not the mayor.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.236
And not you.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.937
Am I right?

17:52.205 --> 17:55.975
The mayor's people solicited
my input as transit chief.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.313
And you endorsed the program.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.715
I didn't mean to be out of line.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.286
Well, when it comes
to department policy,

18:06.386 --> 18:08.255
one person does the endorsing,

18:08.355 --> 18:10.257
and you're looking at him.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.860
I know you're skeptical about
the wisdom of solo patrols...

18:13.960 --> 18:15.628
For good reason.
But the mayor's

18:15.728 --> 18:17.730
concerned about the spike
in subway crime,

18:17.830 --> 18:20.533
and solo patrols enlarge
our footprint underground.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.769
They also thin our ranks.

18:22.869 --> 18:27.374
On the street, the best weapon
our people have is one another.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.041
All due respect,

18:29.142 --> 18:31.411
I was a transit cop
for four years.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.446
I worked most of my tours solo

18:33.546 --> 18:35.047
and lived to tell the tale.

18:35.148 --> 18:38.418
Well, question is,

18:38.518 --> 18:41.087
were you that good
or just that lucky?

18:41.188 --> 18:43.456
Maybe both.

18:43.556 --> 18:46.025
But you'd agree
something needs to done.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.727
And it will be.

18:47.827 --> 18:51.264
But you'll know
when I agree how?

18:51.364 --> 18:53.933
When I tell you I agree.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.736
Look, I just gave the mayor
my honest input.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.572
I thought he deserved that.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.174
After all, he is the boss.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.210
No, he's my boss.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.178
And I'm your boss.

19:07.214 --> 19:11.083
And NYPD policy is decided

19:11.184 --> 19:13.052
in this office.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.121
Understood?

19:16.223 --> 19:18.525
Yes, sir.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.027
That is all.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.207
You Stokes?
Yeah.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.908
You come highly recommended.

19:36.709 --> 19:37.977
What are we doing?

19:38.077 --> 19:40.012
Oh, not "we." You.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.417
I usually work with a key fob.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.152
We're going old-school.

20:02.669 --> 20:03.936
Tick, tock.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.719
Get it started.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.774
We need a brand-new BMW X5
in 72 hours.

20:41.874 --> 20:43.510
Let me know when you find it.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.950
Hey, Sarge.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.585
We're in.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.531
Sergeant Reagan has infiltrated
the stolen car operation.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.232
Our next step
is to identify

21:06.333 --> 21:07.734
their base of operations,
take it down.

21:07.834 --> 21:10.537
All right,
these guys ordered a BMW X5,

21:10.637 --> 21:11.771
so that's what
we're gonna deliver.

21:11.871 --> 21:12.839
Christo?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.173
We'll use the Bluetooth

21:14.273 --> 21:15.408
in Sergeant Reagan's
phone to track him

21:15.508 --> 21:17.410
and slap a GPS
under the vehicle.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.379
We'll create a duplicate key fob
to get him inside.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.147
Once we're in the car,
the suspect will

21:21.247 --> 21:23.182
enter a location
into the navigation system.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.284
Then you guys will follow us
to that location.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.119
Who's your team leader?

21:27.219 --> 21:28.421
Christo will run point.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.289
No disrespect, but, uh,

21:30.390 --> 21:31.691
this is a complicated operation.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.226
We've got more
experienced officers here.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.696
Christo can handle it.

21:40.232 --> 21:41.368
Okay.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.602
Let's do this, gentlemen.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.203
No mistakes.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.847
It's my first time
on this side of the table.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.849
Sorry to treat you like a perp. Yeah.

21:56.949 --> 22:00.052
Even more sorry you decided
to act like a perp.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.454
You're looking at
criminal impersonation

22:01.554 --> 22:03.556
and a possible weapons charge.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.325
It's not like I could
go in there unarmed.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.660
You shouldn't've
gone in there at all.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.462
We checked your
service record.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.197
First Grade Detective,

22:11.297 --> 22:13.332
two medals,
numerous commendations.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.402
I had a pretty solid career.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.403
Had.

22:16.503 --> 22:18.838
Okay, it's over now.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.272
How'd things go south?

22:21.107 --> 22:24.076
124 Detective Squad was one
of the best in the city.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.613
I mean, we ran like clockwork.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.582
Then we get this new CO,
Captain Armbruster.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.350
Called him Captain Ballbuster.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.185
Prick tried to tell me
how to work an informant.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.754
Could have got her killed.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.288
I pushed back.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.825
He gets in my face,
sticks his finger in my chest...

22:38.925 --> 22:42.128
And you got bounced for
striking your superior officer.

22:42.228 --> 22:45.031
One PP told me
I could either vest out,

22:45.131 --> 22:46.799
or face likely termination.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.501
So, I retired.

22:48.601 --> 22:52.338
And now you just look at empty
warehouses all day, every day?

22:53.372 --> 22:54.407
Was it worth it?

22:54.507 --> 22:55.708
I do what this guy says,

22:55.808 --> 22:56.843
and someone dies.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.411
Is that worth it?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.179
So you land on your feet.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.749
What's with
the vigilante routine?

23:02.849 --> 23:05.251
All I ever wanted
to do was be a cop.

23:05.351 --> 23:07.353
Sadly, those days are over.

23:07.454 --> 23:10.523
And I am trying
to live with that.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.894
I just don't know how.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.970
As a career prosecutor,

23:24.070 --> 23:25.705
I know how dangerous it is

23:25.805 --> 23:28.274
when criminals don't pay
for their crimes.

23:28.374 --> 23:30.276
That needs to change.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.078
I'm Erin Reagan,

23:32.178 --> 23:35.214
and when I'm DA, I'm gonna
stop the revolving door

23:35.314 --> 23:37.484
of the criminal justice system.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.022
Isn't this supposed to stop?

23:43.122 --> 23:44.290
Cut.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.593
Someone cue the damn door.

23:46.693 --> 23:50.497
Let's reset and go
again. Back to one.

23:50.597 --> 23:54.433
Please tell me this looks
less idiotic than it feels.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.635
It's gonna be great.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.370
Oh, yes. You know what that is?

23:58.471 --> 24:00.239
That's politician-speak
for "I'm lying."

24:00.339 --> 24:01.841
The Fonz never lied.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.576
Thank you, thank you.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.579
Truth is, there's very little
the DA can do

24:06.679 --> 24:08.380
about these lousy bail laws.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.783
That's Crawford's problem.
Not yours.

24:10.883 --> 24:14.086
Oh, so we're just supposed to
lay all of the system's flaws

24:14.186 --> 24:16.589
at Crawford's feet?
That's the way
the game is played.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.925
Well, then,
maybe the game is not for me,

24:19.025 --> 24:20.760
because it feels dishonest.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.428
It's politics.

24:22.529 --> 24:23.563
What did you expect?

24:23.663 --> 24:26.198
A reasoned debate would be nice.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.333
And so would healthy ice cream.

24:27.433 --> 24:28.635
Ain't gonna happen.

24:28.735 --> 24:30.970
We need you to
go back to one.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.672
I have to go back to one.

24:32.772 --> 24:33.840
For the record,

24:33.940 --> 24:34.941
I'm allowed to hate

24:35.041 --> 24:36.142
all of this, right?

24:36.242 --> 24:37.343
Absolutely.

24:37.443 --> 24:38.911
Uh-huh.

24:39.746 --> 24:40.847
You're doing great.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.949
Oh, yeah.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.317
That's my girl.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.589
Sir, I have...
Now he's eating
off my plate.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.090
By all means, come in.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.324
This guy's got to go, boss.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.893
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.695
Alphabetical order.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.833
Story on solo patrols is about
to drop on the <i>Times</i> website.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.234
Quotes an anonymous

25:02.334 --> 25:04.370
"high-ranking
NYPD source"

25:04.470 --> 25:06.072
supporting the program.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.840
I wonder who, Sid.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.509
I reviewed all solo patrols
in the pilot program,

25:10.610 --> 25:11.944
like you asked.
Two incidents

25:12.044 --> 25:15.147
occurred involving
solo officers yesterday.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.416
Neither one was reported.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.519
Let's hear 'em.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.622
Two perps committed
a violent assault,

25:22.722 --> 25:25.524
eluded arrest
by our solo officer, and then

25:25.625 --> 25:28.227
committed a second attack
at the same station.

25:28.327 --> 25:29.962
Another cop
on solo patrol

25:30.062 --> 25:32.932
was overpowered
by three suspected gang members

25:33.032 --> 25:35.034
and barely escaped
serious injury.

25:35.134 --> 25:38.671
Gee, I wonder how
we were kept in the dark?

25:38.771 --> 25:40.740
They were swept under the rug
by Chief Gallagher.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.709
You got his fingerprints on it?

25:42.809 --> 25:43.643
Yes, boss.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.177
And you are certain that

25:45.277 --> 25:46.779
Gallagher's the source
for the <i>Times</i> story?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.380
My guy in the mayor's office

25:48.480 --> 25:50.416
says the press secretary
put him up to it,

25:50.516 --> 25:52.184
at the request of the mayor.

25:52.284 --> 25:53.686
But if I come down on him,

25:53.786 --> 25:55.688
it's just gonna look like
I'm trying to silence

25:55.788 --> 25:57.990
support for solo patrols.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.125
Not a good look.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.492
No.
But he can't

26:00.593 --> 26:02.862
skate on this, boss.
He's way out of line.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.397
You could make the case that
Gallagher publicly contradicted

26:05.497 --> 26:06.398
department policy.

26:06.498 --> 26:07.499
Come on.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.768
The long and short of it is

26:08.868 --> 26:10.703
the mayor needed NYPD support.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.906
He couldn't get it from me,
so he targeted someone else.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.675
So Gallagher's
being used.

26:15.775 --> 26:19.612
Yeah. And Gallagher
also believes he's right.

26:19.712 --> 26:20.713
So, what's your move?

26:20.813 --> 26:22.715
Well, actually, it's your move.

26:22.815 --> 26:26.085
Share the incidents Sid reported
with our friends in the press,

26:26.185 --> 26:29.055
without our fingerprints.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.458
Let me just find my gloves.

26:32.558 --> 26:34.627
And work my magic.

26:39.198 --> 26:42.534
You're really working
that sweater, Sean.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.403
Thank you. It was my
favorite Christmas gift

26:44.503 --> 26:45.437
from my favorite aunt.

26:45.537 --> 26:46.773
That's funny.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.207
That looks just
like the shirt

26:48.307 --> 26:49.341
that I got Jamie.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.143
Oh. Well...

26:51.243 --> 26:52.311
Uh-oh.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.312
Kind of 'cause it is.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.380
He gave it to me.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.215
I told you
not to wear it.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.617
Wait! You gave away my gift?

26:58.718 --> 27:01.387
It just wasn't totally my style.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.689
That's because he has no style.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.290
You couldn't find someone

27:04.390 --> 27:07.493
outside the family
to re-gift it to?

27:07.593 --> 27:09.095
That's really
not the point, Pop.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.630
Yeah, seriously. I kept
that cashmere scarf you gave me.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.199
You said you loved that.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.200
I lied.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.671
Have you ever seen me
wear cashmere anything?

27:18.771 --> 27:20.072
Oh, well,
to be fair,

27:20.172 --> 27:22.608
he wouldn't recognize it
if you had.

27:22.709 --> 27:24.610
Okay, thank you. I think.

27:24.711 --> 27:26.478
You know,
when it comes to gifts,

27:26.578 --> 27:29.515
you should take a page
from the master.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.619
Cash is king.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.354
I'm using mine to
buy a new phone.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.555
Not too shabby.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.924
Yeah.
Grandpa didn't give me

27:38.024 --> 27:39.525
enough money
to buy a new phone.

27:39.625 --> 27:42.494
Well, the cash gets less
when the kids get bigger.

27:42.594 --> 27:43.595
Uh-huh.

27:43.696 --> 27:44.731
Well, look.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.266
I-I think we can all agree

27:47.366 --> 27:51.370
that, in the end, it all
comes down to that old adage:

27:51.470 --> 27:54.140
it's the thought that counts.

27:54.240 --> 27:55.407
True.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.642
We did put a
lot of thought

27:56.743 --> 27:57.877
into that watch
we got you.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.578
Not to mention a lot of cash.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.413
And we haven't actually seen you

28:01.513 --> 28:03.015
wear it yet.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.251
Yeah.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.953
What's up with that?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.957
That's for special occasions.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.691
Well, maybe you can make
an exception

28:12.792 --> 28:14.126
for family dinner. Yeah.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.563
Speaking of that,
isn't the food delicious?

28:17.663 --> 28:19.899
Pop. Delicious food.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.134
Oh,
yeah. Hold on.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.503
Don't start changing subjects.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.305
Yeah, Francis,
why don't you go get

28:26.405 --> 28:28.140
the watch and show it off?

28:28.240 --> 28:29.275
Yeah.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.947
Oh, my God.
You returned the watch.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.785
You returned the watch?

28:40.452 --> 28:41.453
Oh!

28:41.553 --> 28:44.323
Look.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.658
I appreciated the gesture.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.260
I really did.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.329
It-it, it was...

28:50.429 --> 28:53.265
a very nice thing you did.

28:53.365 --> 28:57.136
But it was just...
a little too showy for me?

28:57.236 --> 28:58.871
Well, that was
the whole point, Dad.

28:58.971 --> 29:02.174
You're the PC. The PC deserves
a statement piece.

29:02.274 --> 29:04.977
Yeah, that one we gave you when
we were kids is really old now.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.013
No, this is a statement piece,

29:07.113 --> 29:10.149
given to me by my wife
and my, my kids

29:10.249 --> 29:11.750
when I became
Chief of Department.

29:11.851 --> 29:12.751
Yeah, but what

29:12.852 --> 29:14.120
does that statement say?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.222
That your kids grew up
to be cheapskates

29:16.322 --> 29:18.090
and won't upgrade my watch?

29:18.190 --> 29:20.126
No.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.861
The statement is,

29:21.961 --> 29:23.896
it still keeps perfect time.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.799
And reminds me
of a perfect time, and I...

29:28.400 --> 29:29.601
I really treasure it.

29:29.701 --> 29:33.239
And this is
right where it belongs.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.343
In other words, you really
hated that new watch, huh?

29:37.443 --> 29:39.178
That, too.

29:47.987 --> 29:48.687
Hey.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
About time.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.891
Dishes can't dry themselves.

29:51.991 --> 29:54.326
Sorry. I was talking to Erin
about Terrence Simms.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.896
Why?
She could take
a look at the case.

29:56.996 --> 29:58.464
Maybe cut the guy a break.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.500
He already got a break.
We released him on a DAT.

30:01.600 --> 30:02.835
Now it's
up to the DA

30:02.935 --> 30:04.803
to decide
to prosecute him or not.

30:04.904 --> 30:07.006
And if he's indicted
and convicted?

30:07.106 --> 30:08.540
Maybe he's looking at time,
maybe he isn't.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.009
I don't really know.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.411
Simms' story about
his CO checked out.

30:12.511 --> 30:13.812
The guy's a major assbag.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.614
He got tossed off the job

30:15.714 --> 30:17.549
a few months after their fight.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.218
Okay, well, assbag or not,

30:19.318 --> 30:21.020
you still can't
put your hands on a boss.

30:21.120 --> 30:24.423
You've crossed the line
a few times in your life.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.092
Well, if I did cross the line,

30:26.192 --> 30:28.127
I paid the price for it,
believe me.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.397
Look, I'm not trying
to screw this guy over.

30:31.497 --> 30:32.932
He did that to himself.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.867
Look, I brought you this case.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.368
Now, I want it back.

30:36.468 --> 30:39.571
Well, unfortunately,
it doesn't work that way.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.340
You don't have a gold shield.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.043
So you brought it to me.
That makes it my case.

30:44.143 --> 30:47.246
Are you pulling rank because
I'm, I'm assigned to patrol,

30:47.346 --> 30:49.048
or because
I'm your sister-in-law, or...

30:49.148 --> 30:50.849
I'm not pulling rank at all.

30:50.950 --> 30:52.919
If any other cop
brought me this case,

30:53.019 --> 30:55.087
I'd never see their face again,
and it wouldn't matter.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.589
I got you the okay
to ride along

30:57.689 --> 30:58.958
because we're family,

30:59.058 --> 31:00.259
because I know
how important it is

31:00.359 --> 31:02.394
for you to learn
this side of the job.

31:02.494 --> 31:04.763
Lucky me.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.265
Okay, if you don't

31:06.365 --> 31:08.067
like the way
I'm working the case,

31:08.167 --> 31:11.070
you're free to walk away
at any time.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.746
This what you guys
are looking for?

31:20.846 --> 31:22.114
That'll work.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.650
This should do the trick.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.954
You drive.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.257
Let's go.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.391
Hey!

31:32.491 --> 31:34.160
What are you guys doing?

31:34.260 --> 31:35.194
Hey.

31:38.164 --> 31:39.465
What the hell
are you doing?

31:39.565 --> 31:40.866
I'm trying to boost a car here.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.735
I'm not looking
to catch a murder rap.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.238
Hey. Hey.

31:48.207 --> 31:49.808
What's this?

31:52.144 --> 31:53.946
Lost him.
Me, too.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.115
There goes your Bluetooth, cop.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.318
Check the car.

32:03.455 --> 32:07.059
All units, lost the signal.
Anyone got eyes on him?

32:09.695 --> 32:10.997
Yo!

32:16.235 --> 32:19.505
First we're gonna
deliver this car,

32:19.605 --> 32:20.572
and then you're gonna die.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.474
Now let's go.

32:22.574 --> 32:24.276
Let's go.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.128
What the hell is this?

32:42.228 --> 32:43.762
Renner's boy turned out
to be a cop.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.531
You brought him here?
Look, you guys

32:45.631 --> 32:47.066
are looking at grand
larceny and conspiracy.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.868
For starters. But if you let
me go, you can cut a deal.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.039
Or we could bury you in a hole
where no one can find you.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.507
Police! Keep your hands
where we can see 'em!
Police!

32:55.607 --> 32:57.143
Hands up!
Hands up!

32:57.243 --> 32:59.811
Hands where we can see 'em!

33:05.684 --> 33:06.918
Hey.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.355
You okay, boss?
How the hell did you find me?

33:09.455 --> 33:10.689
The hat.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.391
What?

33:12.491 --> 33:13.759
GPS tracker.

33:13.859 --> 33:15.527
Had a feeling
things might go sideways,

33:15.627 --> 33:17.463
so I bought
a little insurance.

33:17.563 --> 33:20.032
Anonymous and encrypted.

33:21.367 --> 33:22.501
You trusted your gut.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.270
Like a wise man once taught me.

33:24.370 --> 33:25.671
You can't teach instinct.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.339
You either got it or you don't.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.641
I owe you, Sarge.
Yeah, well, seeing as

33:29.741 --> 33:31.977
I'm standing here in one
piece, I think we're even.

33:32.078 --> 33:33.045
Come on.

33:33.145 --> 33:34.713
Yeah.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.855
Why are we picking up
Simms again?

33:43.955 --> 33:45.957
Because he zip-tied
those suspects.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.826
And the DA wants us
to re-arrest him

33:47.926 --> 33:49.828
and charge him with
unlawful imprisonment.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.698
You still refuse to put in
a good word for the guy?

33:52.798 --> 33:55.701
We went over this already.
It doesn't really matter

33:55.801 --> 33:57.269
what I think about the guy
and what he's doing.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.770
He broke the rules.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.005
Yes.

34:00.106 --> 34:01.507
But he did it to help people.

34:01.607 --> 34:04.143
And he can explain that
to the grand jury.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.512
All units, 10-30 in progress.

34:06.612 --> 34:08.780
1714 47th Street.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.916
That's right around the corner.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.569
Police!

34:30.669 --> 34:31.670
Hands where I can see 'em!

34:31.770 --> 34:33.105
On your knees,
right now!

34:33.205 --> 34:34.240
Get down!

34:38.277 --> 34:40.679
10-13! We got shots fired.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.953
Hey!

34:54.860 --> 34:55.927
Police!

34:59.265 --> 35:00.866
Put down the weapon.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.672
Danny?

35:08.507 --> 35:09.741
Clear!

35:11.377 --> 35:13.512
Gun! Gun!

35:13.612 --> 35:15.381
Give me your hand. Hey.

35:15.481 --> 35:17.249
Come on. Go back. Stay back.

35:20.886 --> 35:22.721
I guess I owe you one.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.792
Now I need your gun.

35:32.097 --> 35:33.832
And your shield.

35:37.903 --> 35:39.671
And I'm gonna have
to take you in.

35:41.039 --> 35:42.974
Come on.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.551
As a prosecutor,

35:52.651 --> 35:55.421
I've dedicated
my professional career

35:55.521 --> 35:56.988
to keeping this city safe.

35:57.088 --> 36:00.459
As a mom, I know
there's nothing more important

36:00.559 --> 36:02.127
than keeping our kids safe.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.762
I'm Erin Reagan.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.532
And I want to be
your District Attorney.

36:07.533 --> 36:08.467
What do you think?

36:08.567 --> 36:10.369
Pretty damn good.

36:10.469 --> 36:13.405
Smart to stress you being a mom
when Crawford don't have kids.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.707
Well, just because I'm a mom

36:15.807 --> 36:17.709
doesn't make me more qualified

36:17.809 --> 36:19.044
to keep kids safe.

36:19.144 --> 36:20.612
Doesn't mean you're not.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.481
Well, that's
a persuasive argument.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.583
It's not about logic.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.552
It's about
connecting with voters,

36:26.652 --> 36:28.186
and this does a bang-up job.

36:28.287 --> 36:29.788
Well, I'm glad you like it,

36:29.888 --> 36:32.724
'cause you're the only person
who's ever gonna see it.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.226
What are you talking about?

36:34.326 --> 36:37.095
I'm gonna fire the consultant.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.297
Why?

36:38.397 --> 36:39.698
Because whoever that is,

36:39.798 --> 36:41.132
it's not me.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.501
You're overreacting.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.304
Well, win or lose election,

36:45.404 --> 36:47.306
I'm gonna be myself. Excuse me.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.708
Yes?

36:51.577 --> 36:53.111
You're kidding me.

36:56.114 --> 36:59.251
Yeah. I understand. Thank you.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.286
What's wrong?

37:00.386 --> 37:02.354
That was the consultant.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.423
They tested the commercial.

37:04.523 --> 37:05.424
And?

37:05.524 --> 37:06.725
Apparently,

37:06.825 --> 37:09.295
it scored higher
than any other spot

37:09.395 --> 37:10.596
they've ever produced.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.064
That's fantastic news.

37:13.164 --> 37:16.668
And they predict a huge bump
in the polls when it airs.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.904
Too bad you're pulling it,

37:19.004 --> 37:21.273
and firing these guys.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.041
Right.

37:27.613 --> 37:31.650
I mean, it-it, it is already
paid for, so maybe, um,

37:31.750 --> 37:34.486
maybe I just give them
another shot.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.288
Good thinking.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.923
The thing is,

37:38.023 --> 37:40.792
what if they start liking
the fake Erin

37:40.892 --> 37:42.861
more than the real one?

37:42.961 --> 37:46.197
High-class problem.

37:53.505 --> 37:56.408
Your mayor isn't happy.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.311
There's no pleasing that guy.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.980
As you know better than anybody?

38:06.785 --> 38:08.153
Nice try.

38:08.253 --> 38:09.521
At what?

38:09.621 --> 38:12.458
Framing this as you and me
against the mayor.

38:12.558 --> 38:14.693
I wasn't.
Yeah, you were.

38:14.793 --> 38:17.629
So, let's just stay
on our own sides

38:17.729 --> 38:19.898
of the field right now.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.435
I didn't report those incidents
to the press because

38:23.535 --> 38:26.405
I didn't want to cause a rush
to judgment on solo patrols.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.377
So you chose
deception over duty

38:31.477 --> 38:33.078
to bolster your position.

38:33.178 --> 38:35.581
I should have brought those
incidents to your attention.

38:35.681 --> 38:36.715
I apologize.

38:36.815 --> 38:38.584
That train left the station.

38:38.684 --> 38:41.019
But I still owe you the apology.

38:44.423 --> 38:47.526
And we still have a problem.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.060
Sir?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.596
In light of
the reported incidents,

38:50.696 --> 38:52.764
the mayor is being
roundly attacked

38:52.864 --> 38:55.734
for advocating solo patrols.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.504
He wants the program discontinued,

38:58.604 --> 39:00.872
effective immediately,

39:00.972 --> 39:03.775
with fireworks
and a full orchestra.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.979
I see.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.618
He's also looking
for a scalp to cover his ass.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.953
But his people
reached out to me.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.288
A word of advice?

39:17.389 --> 39:21.560
It is a time-honored tradition
to kiss ass to get ahead.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.429
The trick is

39:23.529 --> 39:26.097
knowing which ass to kiss.

39:28.066 --> 39:31.269
The mayor wants you gone.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.250
But he doesn't run
this department.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.018
I do.

39:48.554 --> 39:49.788
Sir?

39:51.990 --> 39:54.159
I told him
you would be reprimanded,

39:54.259 --> 39:57.195
but you will remain
Chief of the Transit Bureau.

39:57.295 --> 39:59.330
But won't that put you
at odds with the mayor?

39:59.431 --> 40:01.467
What doesn't?

40:03.535 --> 40:05.937
You're a good officer
with a bright future.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.874
I trust you'll learn
from this experience.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.976
Thank you, sir.

40:11.076 --> 40:14.846
But substitute your judgment
for mine again?

40:15.614 --> 40:17.282
You're gone.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.130
(inhales0

40:40.238 --> 40:41.940
Couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

40:42.040 --> 40:43.441
I'm blocks away.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.010
I'm supposed to just sit
on my hands?
Yes.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.311
You are supposed
to sit on your hands.

40:46.411 --> 40:47.445
You're not a cop.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.780
He saved our asses, Danny.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.815
I'm aware of that.

40:49.915 --> 40:52.317
No. No, no. He's right.

40:54.886 --> 40:57.455
I'm not a cop anymore.

40:58.389 --> 41:01.392
It's time
I start acting like it.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.263
Maybe.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.203
Say hello to Lieutenant Gormley.

41:13.438 --> 41:14.940
Sir.
No, sit.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.407
What's going on?

41:18.744 --> 41:20.579
I reviewed your record.

41:20.679 --> 41:22.548
You crossed the line plenty.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.716
Slugging your boss,

41:24.816 --> 41:26.685
impersonating an officer,

41:26.785 --> 41:28.687
couple of misdemeanors.
Yes, sir.

41:28.787 --> 41:31.790
But you also kept businesses
from getting ripped off.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.025
You aided
a wounded civilian,

41:34.125 --> 41:35.761
came to the aid

41:35.861 --> 41:37.462
of officers
under fire.

41:37.563 --> 41:39.130
So, provided

41:39.230 --> 41:42.701
the DA drops the charges
against you...

41:42.801 --> 41:44.770
the commissioner's open
to considering reinstatement,

41:44.870 --> 41:46.638
if you're so inclined.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.474
Are you saying I could
get my shield back?
I'm not saying anything.

41:52.978 --> 41:55.280
I'm saying
we could talk about it.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.119
We'll leave you to it.

42:04.956 --> 42:08.059
That was a pretty cool move,
calling One PP.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.662
Well, I mean,
Simms did screw up,

42:10.762 --> 42:12.664
but he deserves a second chance.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.099
The guy was a hell of a cop.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.967
Why the change
of heart?

42:16.067 --> 42:19.638
Well, could be that there
was this voice in my ear

42:19.738 --> 42:20.806
that wouldn't let up.

42:20.906 --> 42:21.940
I do that.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.609
Yeah. Well, you were right.

42:23.709 --> 42:27.078
And whatever good happens
to him, it's because of you.

42:27.178 --> 42:28.880
Danny Reagan,
I do believe

42:28.980 --> 42:30.949
you just gave me
an actual compliment.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.684
