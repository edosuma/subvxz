WEBVTT

00:07.720 --> 00:08.720
Zoe.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.880
You know I've loved getting to know you.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.240
- You're beautiful.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.640
And smart.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.000
And, uh... exuberant.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.840
A strong woman like you

00:22.840 --> 00:25.520
deserves to be with someone
who is truly her match.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.400
I'm sorry, Zoe,

00:31.400 --> 00:32.560
but I'm not that man.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.200
- Oh.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.840
- Yeah, you are.
- Nah.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.040
Like, I'd never even heard
the word "exuberant" before you used it.

00:42.560 --> 00:45.400
Yeah, and I'd never heard
of high-intensity interval training,

00:45.400 --> 00:47.600
but now look, repping squats all day.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.080
- Seriously.
- It's going pretty good.

00:49.080 --> 00:50.400
- Yeah.
- Wait, Zoe.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.200
Look, I'm sorry, but you're not my match.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.720
So, what you're saying is, um...

01:00.800 --> 01:02.840
maybe if I'd laughed
a little bit harder at your jokes.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.960
- Come on, don't do this.
- Or maybe...

01:04.960 --> 01:06.800
Maybe if I'd copped more of a feel

01:06.800 --> 01:08.160
of your [bleep] balls under the blanket

01:08.160 --> 01:10.200
while 15 [bleep] people
stood around filming.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.400
Maybe then I'd be your match?

01:11.400 --> 01:12.920
- Are we still shooting?

01:13.040 --> 01:15.520
I can't believe I got sucked
into this shit.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.560
And for what?

01:17.160 --> 01:20.920
For a hot dummy who thinks
the moon is the sun's shadow.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.240
Are you kidding me? [bleep] this shit!

01:23.240 --> 01:25.880
Yeah, well, some of us are here for love.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.800
Oh, love? Oh, are you here for love?

01:28.800 --> 01:29.880
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:29.880 --> 01:31.400
Because nothing says love

01:31.400 --> 01:34.960
like promoting your online fitness app
in between rose ceremonies.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.400
- But I guess I'm the [bleep] fame whore.
-  Are we gonna cut?

01:37.400 --> 01:41.440
For hoping that maybe a radio hosting gig
would come out of this sexist shit.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.160
-  I think we should cut.
- Or a [bleep] podcast at the very least.

01:45.760 --> 01:49.560
This whole show is as fake
as your spray tan, mate.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.800
These fake flowers?

01:51.800 --> 01:53.520
- Fake, fake...
-  Calm down.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.400
Well, that one's real,
but it's not attached to anything.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.400
There's no [bleep] ceiling in here.

01:58.400 --> 01:59.800
Bullshit!

01:59.800 --> 02:04.160
Oh, and the cheese that we never even eat!

02:05.320 --> 02:06.840
- And the doves.
- Not the doves.

02:06.840 --> 02:08.920
Don't even get me started on the doves.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.360
- Don't touch my doves.
- Out of my way.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.840
- Don't touch 'em.
- The love birds,

02:11.840 --> 02:16.320
rats of the sky that make single women
everywhere feel shit about themselves.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.680
She's lost the friggin' plot.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.440
-  Still rolling. Do not--
-  you!

02:19.440 --> 02:21.560
-  Zoe...
- Come on, out you get!

02:21.560 --> 02:23.280
-  Zoe, just stop.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.280
-  Zoe, don't!
- Go on! Go! Go on! Go!

02:26.880 --> 02:28.000
Get out of here!

02:29.680 --> 02:31.160
-  Oh, my God!

02:32.280 --> 02:34.400
This is gold.
Don't cut. Do not cut.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.760
It shat in my mouth.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.320
<i>♪ Is there any possibility
you'll quit gossiping about me ♪</i>

02:41.320 --> 02:43.440
<i>♪ To hide your insecurities? ♪</i>

02:43.440 --> 02:46.680
<i>♪ All they say is, "Na, na, na, na, na" ♪</i>

02:49.040 --> 02:51.040
<i>♪ Na, na, na, na, na ♪</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:12.800
Oh, no, no, no.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.000
Is this the way it's gonna be between us?

03:20.440 --> 03:22.360
You acting like a little bitch, and me

03:23.200 --> 03:25.280
realizing I'm talking to myself
out loud again?

03:54.640 --> 03:57.920
Oi! Thought we were having a moment.

04:24.240 --> 04:25.480
What the fuck?

04:29.480 --> 04:31.240
Bitch, this is an emergency.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.520
I was given a bad edit!

04:43.760 --> 04:45.040
Shit. Okay.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.560
So, besides organizing our reunion,
which has kept me busy,

05:11.560 --> 05:14.160
I'm currently on track
for pre-selection in 2036

05:14.160 --> 05:15.240
if the bellwether sticks.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.200
Uh, uh, no, no, no.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.000
Teresa, that is your fourth blue one
this hour.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.440
Slow down or drink an orange one,
for God's sake.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.480
- Do you want an orange one?

05:26.480 --> 05:28.560
- Well... I was...
- They're really nice.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.800
So, um...

05:33.440 --> 05:37.480
do you know if Zoe mentioned
if she was coming or not?

05:37.480 --> 05:39.280
Not a word.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.600
Just because a bird took a dump

05:41.600 --> 05:43.560
in your mouth on national television,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.880
it doesn't mean you get
a hall pass on RSVPs.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.320
Yeah.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.880
Oh, don't look at me like that.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.120
I know you were school captain, but

05:54.120 --> 05:56.160
you just disappeared
halfway through the year.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.440
And, whatever, technically,
I was caretaker school captain,

05:58.440 --> 06:02.080
- but someone had to step up.
- Of course, no question.

06:02.080 --> 06:06.200
Speaking of upgrades, have you been
reintroduced to Saskia 2.0 yet?

06:06.680 --> 06:10.360
Did you know that for every pack of tampon
Saskia sells, she donates another pack

06:10.360 --> 06:12.560
to chicks in, like, poor countries?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.920
I mean, don't say people can't change.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.960
Didn't she make your life hell, Genevieve?

06:17.960 --> 06:21.040
Didn't she make your life hell, Amelia?

06:21.040 --> 06:23.000
Anyway, why did you leave?

06:23.000 --> 06:26.920
Rumor is you got expelled
for fucking that staff member.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.560
That's not why I left.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.240
You have made that sound
way more scandalous than it was.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.240
Well, what then?

06:32.240 --> 06:33.400
- Why did you...

06:33.400 --> 06:35.440
- Sorry.
- What, you married him?

06:36.240 --> 06:37.960
You didn't include that in your bio.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.400
-  <i>You having fun up there, babe?</i>
- It's worse than I thought.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.560
They think I ran off
with the bloody maths teacher.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.880
<i>Well, a 19-year-old
groundkeeper's assistant is way sexier.</i>

06:45.880 --> 06:47.040
<i>So, did she show?</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:48.960
No. Told you she wouldn't.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.040
<i>Ah, come on,
you only just got there.</i>

06:51.040 --> 06:52.360
I'm gonna head home.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.720
<i>Oh, but, Mels,
it's a six-hour drive.</i>

06:54.720 --> 06:56.720
<i>Stay. She might show...</i>

06:58.240 --> 06:59.360
Hello? Danny?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.320
Reception's shit up here.

07:01.320 --> 07:03.080
I can't even get 3G!

07:10.520 --> 07:12.160
"Go to higher ground, Zoe."

07:12.160 --> 07:13.720
"Yes, Dad, I am."

07:13.720 --> 07:16.440
"You know, your old school
is the nearest evacuation point

07:16.440 --> 07:17.600
in a weather emergency, Zoe."

07:17.600 --> 07:19.040
"Uh, yeah, Dad. I know that.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.920
I'm literally going to the school
right now."

07:21.560 --> 07:24.320
"How come you never talk to me
in your imaginary conversations, Zoe?"

07:24.320 --> 07:26.240
"Now is really not the time, Mum."

07:27.000 --> 07:29.680
"Is that why you decided to hole up
in your dad's sad little caravan

07:29.680 --> 07:31.800
instead of coming to stay
in my nice big house with me?"

07:31.800 --> 07:34.040
Oh, my God, stop talking to yourself!

08:05.160 --> 08:07.680
He's got over
a million followers now.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.920
And the timing of this little event
was perfect

08:09.920 --> 08:14.200
because Constable had
a cover shoot for <i>Dogue</i> in Seminyak.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.640
So I figured I'd make an appearance
while I was in the neighborhood.

08:16.640 --> 08:19.320
You are the best exchange student ever.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.240
- Is he here or...
- No, he's at a puppy spa in Bondi.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.400
- Oh.
- But here is my baby

08:25.400 --> 08:27.440
at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.

08:28.720 --> 08:29.640
Oh!

08:29.640 --> 08:34.400
Oh, Teresa, she didn't mean "baby" baby.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.280
Guys, guys, pff, we can, what,
we can use the word "baby."

08:39.280 --> 08:42.600
Lots of couples,
they fail the first round of IVF.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.440
And somewhere
in a little freezer in Brisbane,

08:46.440 --> 08:49.640
my embryos are like, "Whoo!

08:50.200 --> 08:51.640
You party while you can, Mama,

08:51.760 --> 08:55.960
because next time we're gonna stay
in your big warm uterus."

08:55.960 --> 09:00.000
And I'm like, "Okay, babies."
'Cause I'm fine.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.880
- Ter...

09:02.880 --> 09:04.880
Ah, no! No!

09:04.880 --> 09:07.760
Well, I'm sorry. It's just that
I traveled halfway across the world

09:07.760 --> 09:08.640
to catch up with my best friend

09:08.760 --> 09:10.640
and all she can do is bitch
about her shriveled fucking womb.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.840
I mean, who even does IVF at our age?

09:12.840 --> 09:15.200
- Guys, I'm going to go.
- No, no, no, no.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.840
We haven't even spoken about Zoe and
<i>The Match</i> and also why you left school.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.240
- I've really got to go, guys.
- Mmm.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.640
Jeez.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.760
So, what is it that you do now, Renee?

09:25.880 --> 09:29.480
- Um, I am a nail technician.
- Oh, darling.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.520
You... Don't, don't tell people that.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.520
No exploding water.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.720
Just years of high school
scar tissue coming back.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.120
Oh, shit!

10:04.960 --> 10:07.040
What the fuck?

10:09.880 --> 10:10.960
Hey, excuse me.

10:10.960 --> 10:13.320
Where's the emergency
meeting point or whatever?

10:15.280 --> 10:16.320
Hello?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.640
- Rude.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.520
Nah. Nothing.

10:39.280 --> 10:41.440
I can't believe how well
everyone's doing, hey?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.720
Yeah.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.240
All of these rich girls

10:44.240 --> 10:48.200
who were handed every social privilege
on a silver platter, you know?

10:48.200 --> 10:51.320
While, um, a scholarship scab like me
had to sell my plasma

10:51.320 --> 10:52.960
just so I could afford
to go on a ski trip.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.080
- Oh...
- But, yeah, everyone's doing so well.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.400
It's nice that you came anyway, Phoebe.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.320
Don't flatter yourself. My boss reckons

11:00.320 --> 11:03.440
he won't give me a bonus
till he can see I've done some human shit.

11:05.280 --> 11:07.040
Uh, what is it that you do anyway?

11:08.080 --> 11:09.000
Renny?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.680
It's Renee. Yeah.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.440
Um, I am...

11:15.600 --> 11:17.240
a doctor. Yes.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.240
Nice.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.640
Oh, my God, she came!

11:30.640 --> 11:31.640
Ah!

11:32.080 --> 11:33.640
What the fuck is going on here?

11:33.640 --> 11:35.880
I'm so happy you're here. You know,
screw him and his interval training.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.720
He doesn't deserve you.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.600
Is this our reunion?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.760
- Yes!
-  Ten years, dum-dum.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.320
Too famous to RSVP, are we?

11:43.320 --> 11:45.520
Um, is this still where
the evacuation point is?

11:45.520 --> 11:46.920
Didn't you get the emails?

11:46.920 --> 11:48.720
- There have been emails.
- No, I haven't been on email.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.840
- But have you guys seen...
- No one could contact you.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.960
That was kind of the point.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.360
Zoe, when people don't RSVP,
it makes catering impossible...

11:54.360 --> 11:56.080
Oh, shh, Pepé.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.480
- Don't call me that.
- Drink up, Zo-Zo.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.920
- Whoo!
- Tell us what the mansion was like.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.840
Do you get to keep dresses
from the show?

12:03.840 --> 12:05.240
No, they're hired.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.960
But, guys, listen, because the birds
outside were flying around in circles...

12:08.960 --> 12:10.560
Hope you had your mouth
closed this time, babe.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.000
What does bird shit taste like, Zoe?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.240
It is perfectly fine to be afraid of birds
after what you've been through.

12:15.240 --> 12:18.960
The ground was shaking,
and then all of these little cracks...

12:18.960 --> 12:21.880
Remember the time she cried wolf
about a gas leak in the chemistry labs

12:21.880 --> 12:23.040
to get out of the exam?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.800
"Oh, can you smell that?"

12:24.800 --> 12:26.000
Please, listen! Please, listen!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.920
Or when she said
she met Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.640
Or when she got caught smoking
and the fire alarm went off,

12:32.640 --> 12:34.040
so she told Sister Bicky...

12:34.040 --> 12:37.680
The fucking Earth is cracking open
and gushing everywhere!

12:37.680 --> 12:40.480
And I'm not crazy.
I was just given a bad edit.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.720
- Zoe...
-  Are you okay?

12:58.240 --> 13:00.280
Uh... Uh...

13:01.160 --> 13:03.160
Hey, you've been through a lot.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.600
Why don't you just take a minute?
Go and splash some water on your face.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.640
Yeah. Yep.

13:11.440 --> 13:12.600
Yeah. Off you go.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.800
God, I love a sequel.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.400
What's wrong with you?

13:21.400 --> 13:23.320
Put your phone away. She's clearly unwell.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.280
Okay, Sas.

13:24.280 --> 13:26.400
As if you wouldn't have been
all over that shit at school.

13:26.400 --> 13:30.040
I was a cunt in high school, Sandy.
Some of us grow out of it.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.640
See? I told you she's changed.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.120
It's fine, Zoe. It was just some
weird weather at Dad's place,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.920
and it's not even happening here.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.360
No cracks, no water explosions.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.640
It's totally fine.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.680
And they're right. They're right.
You have been through a lot.

13:49.440 --> 13:50.960
And you do tend to exaggerate.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.000
And you do make drama.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.840
Even though you totally did meet JTT.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.920
But that is not the point. The point is

13:58.360 --> 14:02.560
that everything is going to be fine
and you're going to go out there

14:02.560 --> 14:05.160
and you're going to be normal
and you're going to have fun.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.400
Mm!

14:08.920 --> 14:11.040
And you're going to stop talking
to yourself in the mirror.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.400
I can't have BO on my forehead.
I just can't.

14:19.120 --> 14:21.320
- It's the hats.
- The hats?

14:21.320 --> 14:23.400
It's the stupid scratchy hats.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.640
- Oh!

14:29.360 --> 14:30.360
-  Hey!
- Hey.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.600
Hi!

14:34.400 --> 14:36.640
Zoe, are you okay?

14:36.640 --> 14:39.640
- You just... You seem...
-  Batshit crazy?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.000
Yeah, I know.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.800
Um, I think it's just, like,
six months off the grid, you know?

14:44.800 --> 14:48.640
My sense of humor's
a bit, bit funky.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.760
Okay, good.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.040
Um, I'm glad you're okay. I'm gonna go.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.040
Um, Amelia, hang on.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.800
- Hi.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.200
How are you?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.960
How have you been for, like, you know,

15:01.960 --> 15:04.480
every minute of every day
for the last ten years?

15:05.160 --> 15:07.840
Not much to tell, really, um...

15:08.360 --> 15:11.960
Danny and I took over the farm
from my parents, so we're still there,

15:11.960 --> 15:13.120
farming peanuts.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.200
Danny? Like, "Danny" Danny?

15:18.520 --> 15:19.600
Cool.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.080
But I also have
a half-finished online law degree.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.280
That's awesome.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.920
Laying it out like that,
that sounds really fucking depressing.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.080
So, yeah, I'm glad you're okay.
I'm just, I'm really...

15:29.080 --> 15:31.680
You can't go out there, actually.

15:33.160 --> 15:34.520
Because, um...

15:36.520 --> 15:38.200
Because I need you to sniff my forehead.

15:39.560 --> 15:41.920
I'm serious, because they're all
talking shit about me out there

15:41.920 --> 15:43.360
and it's the only thing
that makes me feel better,

15:43.360 --> 15:45.320
- so come on, do it.
- I'm not going to sniff your forehead.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.280
Sniff it. I need you to, please.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.320
- It's so weird.
- Please.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.600
- It's weird.
- Please. It makes me feel so much better.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.680
- No.
- Come on.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.520
Come on, sniff it.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.880
Oh, you fucking did it!

15:56.880 --> 15:59.000
Oh, my God, Zoe! You made me do that.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.280
- You...
- Ah!

16:01.280 --> 16:02.440
Please, just stay here.

16:03.240 --> 16:07.120
<i>Because I don't want
the CliffsNotes of your life. Okay?</i>

16:09.120 --> 16:10.880
You can go back out there,
back to the farm,

16:10.880 --> 16:12.960
back to real life, any old time,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.480
but for now, please, just stay
and have a drink with me.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.600
It's been a decade.

16:21.360 --> 16:22.440
One drink.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.040
- Excellent.
-  Then I have to go.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.320
- Fine, but I'm keeping these for now.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.600
Are Tegan and Megan still here?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.040
Uh, yeah, last I heard,
they were out on the fingering bench.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.480
Fantastic. Then I will see you shortly,
you friggin' weirdo.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.000
You riding a unicorn
that's peeing itself on a pink cloud.

16:44.360 --> 16:48.160
Oh, shit, it's the gracious
runner-up herself.

16:48.520 --> 16:49.720
Thought you were MIA.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.160
- Tegan.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.160
Megan.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.120
Oi.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.480
Do you remember a chick from our year
called Laura Cunningham?

16:57.480 --> 16:58.960
Uh...

16:59.120 --> 17:01.520
- No, why?
- She died, dude.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.080
- Yeah, look, there's a sad little plaque.
- Buh-bam.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.440
Some bitches getting married,
some popping out kids,

17:09.080 --> 17:12.720
this chick is getting hymens
wiped all of her memorial plaque

17:12.720 --> 17:14.200
every time there's a school disco.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.640
R.I.P.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.400
Sad.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.240
Um...

17:23.280 --> 17:24.440
Do you have anything stronger?

17:24.560 --> 17:26.280
- Ooh!
- Okay.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.760
You want to go up or down, girlfriend?

17:28.760 --> 17:30.480
Up. Real fast.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.400
Fast enough to forget how badly

17:33.400 --> 17:35.320
I interpreted the dress code, right?

17:35.720 --> 17:38.520
- Look, no payment necessary.
- Oh!

17:38.520 --> 17:40.560
What you did on <i>The Match</i> was peak TV.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.160
- I was living.
- Oh, living.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.920
Happy to be of service.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.320
Thanks.

17:48.920 --> 17:49.960
Um...

17:53.000 --> 17:55.800
Is everything good out here?

17:56.200 --> 17:59.440
Fucking A. Beautiful spot
to avoid those judgmental bitches.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.200
Great.

18:01.200 --> 18:05.160
Laura Cunningham,
I bequeath this joint upon thine lips.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.080
- Puff, puff, puff.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.560
- Better?
- Damn fucking yes, bitches!

18:39.320 --> 18:40.240
Ooh, wow.

18:41.240 --> 18:44.560
No, I wouldn't call myself a hero,
but if you want to, that's fine.

18:45.560 --> 18:49.240
I don't understand how you can call me
your best friend and unfollow my dog.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.080
- Doesn't really seem...
- Second wind, here I come.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.000
Ugh!

18:58.200 --> 18:59.760
Oh, my God, and...

19:04.080 --> 19:05.440
But it's more than that...

19:06.320 --> 19:09.320
And it's like, being a doctor,
like, it's, it's not a job for me,

19:09.320 --> 19:11.240
you know what I mean?
It's more of a vocation.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.640
Uh, Sandy, there's a line.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.720
- Settle down, Pepé Le Poo.
- Don't call me that.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.320
Well, don't shit yourself at grade-nine
camp and we won't have to, PLP.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.320
She wasn't even here in grade nine.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.080
It's like you never left
oh, captain, my captain.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.880
Actually, um, on that topic...

19:36.880 --> 19:38.640
Ooh, Too Cools in the photobooth.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.280
Wait for me, fellow TCs.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.000
Why do white women always feel
the need to do shit like this?

20:27.520 --> 20:28.720
Hey, Zoe.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.560
Can I grab my keys?
I need to... I need to go.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.520
You can't leave. It's the dance.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.320
I don't know the dance.
I wasn't here, remember?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.800
It's okay, it's fine.
We'll teach you. It's super easy.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.400
Not all of us are willing
to make a fool of ourselves

20:43.400 --> 20:45.080
for excitement's sake, Zoe.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.640
I guess I should just be grateful that
you're actually saying goodbye this time

20:49.640 --> 20:51.040
instead of just disappearing, huh?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.760
Can I get my keys, please, Zoe?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.960
Do you know how that felt, Amelia?

20:59.560 --> 21:03.320
Getting shafted between my parents,
and then you just ghosted me, too?

21:05.640 --> 21:07.520
I don't know what I was
expecting from you.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.320
Oh, yeah, no, cool.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.880
Cool, just bail.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.280
Because that's what you do. See ya.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.160
What the fuck?

21:44.440 --> 21:45.520
Um...

21:47.400 --> 21:52.600
We have a... a situation
at the fingering bench.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.200
Uh, just checking,
you guys see it too, right?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.560
'Cause either there's water everywhere

21:58.560 --> 22:01.600
or this THC really is the fucking tits,

22:01.600 --> 22:04.000
- you know?

22:05.920 --> 22:08.960
Oh, my fucking God!

22:11.600 --> 22:12.840
Guys, guys.

22:13.160 --> 22:14.720
Ladies of Ridge Heights!

22:15.000 --> 22:16.320
Let's stay calm!

22:16.800 --> 22:18.320
It's just a flash flood.

22:19.360 --> 22:22.080
Pepé, we're on top of a fucking mountain.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.200
- I don't think we're tripping.
- No, old classic, eh?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.320
Fuck!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.800
No, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

22:36.800 --> 22:39.600
Well, someone's gotta help them.
They're clearly off their faces.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.680
There might be diseases
and stuff in the water.

22:42.680 --> 22:45.760
Uh, medically speaking,
it's a bad idea, right, Renee?

22:45.760 --> 22:46.720
Uh...

22:47.720 --> 22:50.640
Yes. Medically speaking, don't do it.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.800
- It's okay.
- Zoe.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.240
Wait up, Sas.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.040
Yeah. Yes.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.880
Come. Come.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.920
I'm too young and beautiful to...

23:22.560 --> 23:25.200
Don't abandon us, I'm scared!

23:26.320 --> 23:28.960
I just farted out of my butthole.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.840
Well, I guess we can't go in the water.

23:38.080 --> 23:41.000
- I have an idea.
- Melly was fucking there right after me.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.680
It's fuchsia, not salmon.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.880
Shut up, Sandy.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.120
Ladies! Stop!

23:46.120 --> 23:49.200
As former school captain,
I believe the best course of action

23:49.200 --> 23:52.560
is to leave Tweedledum and Tweedledickhead
up there until the waters go down.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.960
Wait, Pepé, weren't you
caretaker school captain?

23:55.960 --> 23:57.480
Stop calling me that.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.040
Are you going to say anything, Saskia?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.600
Little nickname still sticks.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.000
Yeah. Don't call her that.

24:03.240 --> 24:07.200
Okay. I cannot find my fucking bag,
and no one is helping me look.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.600
- It's not the most important thing.

24:09.600 --> 24:11.040
It is important right now.

24:11.040 --> 24:12.440
I have an idea.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.720
What if we tied all the balloons
from the party together

24:16.720 --> 24:20.160
and place the trestle table
on top of some kind of flotation device?

24:24.000 --> 24:25.160
Sorry. Who are you?

24:26.440 --> 24:27.480
Laura Cunningham.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.040
Wait, aren't you dead?

24:29.520 --> 24:31.480
Uh, n... No, no.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.480
Uh, yes, you are.

24:33.480 --> 24:36.080
We put a memorial plaque
on the fingering bench and everything.

24:36.080 --> 24:37.240
Oh, that's nice.

24:37.880 --> 24:38.880
But I'm not dead.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.960
Wouldn't you have figured that out
when you realized there was no funeral?

24:46.320 --> 24:47.960
Which means no one came to my funeral.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.840
- Shit, sorry, Caitlin.
- It's Laura.

24:51.840 --> 24:53.840
Net balls will be way more buoyant
than balloons,

24:53.840 --> 24:57.480
so why don't we raid the sports shed
for all of the net balls that we can find?

24:57.480 --> 24:58.920
And find my bag.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.720
It's a D'Amiré. I...

25:03.200 --> 25:05.080
- Zoe...
- Net balls! Let's go

25:08.520 --> 25:11.040
- I can't do it.
-  Yes, you can.

25:11.040 --> 25:14.080
Just move your fat ass
and inch down like I did.

25:14.080 --> 25:17.000
Fuck you, Tegan.
Not all of us have man arms like you.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.200
Well, fuck you. Stay there.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.800
Believe in yourself!

25:20.800 --> 25:21.840
Just don't panic!

25:21.840 --> 25:23.920
Slow down your breathing. It'll help!

25:23.920 --> 25:26.160
- Zoe.
- Just start backing down, Megan.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.640
Zoe, you said something
about cracks rumbling?

25:28.640 --> 25:30.800
What if there's biting dolphins, huh?

25:30.800 --> 25:32.720
- What?
- I'm... Mmm.

25:32.720 --> 25:35.160
What did you mean when you said
the Earth was gushing?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.920
The seal's not there anymore, Megan.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.320
Can we talk about this
a little bit later, please?

25:38.320 --> 25:39.560
I'm kind of busy right now.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.240
Not the seals, the biting dolphins!

25:41.240 --> 25:42.800
What's she talking about?

25:42.800 --> 25:43.800
Now I'm blanking.

25:43.800 --> 25:44.760
Zoe.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.360
- Please. Come on!

25:47.920 --> 25:50.240
Oh, the ones that got, like, a pig face.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.920
And they look a bit,
"Eh, how are you going?"

25:52.920 --> 25:54.520
- Zoe, what did you mean?
- Shut up.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.280
Oh, oh, oh, dugongs!

25:56.280 --> 25:58.280
Dugongs!

25:58.280 --> 26:00.440
Dugong! Yes, a fucking dugong!

26:00.440 --> 26:02.720
Zoe, please. What was leaking?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.760
Oh, my God. Fine, fine.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.360
Okay? All of this fucking
weird shit was going down,

26:07.360 --> 26:09.200
and then these cracks started
opening up in the ground,

26:09.200 --> 26:11.360
and all this water was gushing out, okay?

26:13.280 --> 26:16.440
You knew it was fucking flooding
and you didn't think to say anything?

26:16.440 --> 26:19.000
What? I did. I tried to tell you.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.040
Nobody listened to me.
You all thought I was crazy.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.480
- Just lower yourself like Tegan!

26:24.480 --> 26:26.680
- No, Zoe. You just got drunk.
- You can do it.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.840
Just fucking jump!

26:39.200 --> 26:40.480
This is going well.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.560
It's going really well.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.320
-  Say what?
-  Net, over.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.600
- Net, net, over.
- Uh-huh.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.920
- Net, over.
- Let's go. Net--

26:51.920 --> 26:54.080
Amelia, hey, what's wrong?

26:54.800 --> 26:55.640
She knew.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.280
She knew it was flooding,
or gushing, actually,

26:59.280 --> 27:01.080
if you consult Zoey's thesaurus.

27:01.720 --> 27:05.080
Yeah, okay, I knew
some weird shit was going on.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.000
I told you guys that.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.440
I didn't know Noah's bloody Ark
was coming up the hill, did I?

27:08.440 --> 27:09.880
You knew?

27:10.520 --> 27:13.640
- You knew?
- She just got wasted anyway.

27:13.640 --> 27:15.760
- Hang on.
- Oh, my God, America!

27:16.280 --> 27:18.840
Does anybody know
what is happening in the Americas?

27:18.840 --> 27:20.880
I need to find Constable!
Where the hell is my bag?

27:20.880 --> 27:23.080
- It is a...
-  D'Amiré.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.120
Jesus, we fucking know.

27:25.120 --> 27:28.400
For God's sake, Zoe,
you should have screamed black and blue.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.440
Plus, you owe us 40 bucks for the pill.

27:30.440 --> 27:33.880
Yeah, you don't get freebies
when you knew shit and didn't say shit.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.720
I did say shit!

27:36.800 --> 27:38.880
What? Okay. Yeah, fine. Sure.

27:38.880 --> 27:41.280
I knew something was up, but, like,

27:41.280 --> 27:44.920
isn't it better that we're up here
instead of out there?

27:44.920 --> 27:46.840
- Huh.
- Like, me not harping on about it

27:46.840 --> 27:49.320
actually is kind of the best
possible thing for us.

27:49.320 --> 27:51.840
Like, I kind of saved our lives.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.760
You know what?
That dude on <i>The Match</i> was right, Zoe.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.680
You're just
an attention-craving fame whore.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.400
Good to see you haven't changed a bit.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.240
I haven't changed?

28:06.080 --> 28:07.760
That's a good one, Sandy.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.360
I have been back with you bitches
for one night,

28:10.360 --> 28:14.000
and already I know
that Genevieve is still a fucking knock.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.520
Saskia is still a bitch.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.000
She's just got a marketing team
to hide behind now.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.640
Renee is still a freaking try-hard.
Phoebe is a soulless workaholic.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.080
Tegan and Megan,
still fucking drug addicts.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.840
Laura, who even are you, honestly?

28:27.840 --> 28:30.920
- Sandy, what are you even doing here?

28:30.920 --> 28:34.360
You went to the school for one year
and shat on it the whole time.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.400
- Like, why did you come?

28:37.440 --> 28:38.280
And you...

28:40.240 --> 28:41.640
You're a disappointment.

28:43.200 --> 28:46.040
You were supposed to be remarkable.

28:46.040 --> 28:50.040
And now you're a redneck
peanut farmer living in bumfuck nowhere

28:50.040 --> 28:52.520
with your dead shit
high school sweetheart.

28:52.960 --> 28:56.360
Honestly, if I don't see you again
for another ten years,

28:56.960 --> 28:58.480
it's fucking fine by me.

29:25.640 --> 29:26.960
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.440
- Pull me back, pull me back!

29:40.000 --> 29:41.440
Mels.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.360
What?

30:03.080 --> 30:04.600
Oh, almost forgot.

30:27.160 --> 30:28.840
- Oh, shit!
