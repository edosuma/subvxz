WEBVTT

00:09.981 --> 00:12.348
Howie? Howie, wake up.

00:12.350 --> 00:13.649
It's time.

00:13.651 --> 00:15.318
Oh. Did your water break?

00:15.320 --> 00:16.819
No.

00:16.821 --> 00:18.721
Are you feeling
any contractions?

00:18.723 --> 00:20.656
No.

00:20.658 --> 00:22.291
Wait. Well,
where are you going?

00:22.293 --> 00:23.659
To the hospital.

00:23.661 --> 00:27.530
Today's my due date,
and this crap needs to end now.

00:28.633 --> 00:32.067
Honey, babies don't
always come on their due date.

00:32.070 --> 00:34.470
Halley was two weeks late.

00:35.373 --> 00:37.774
But this baby's a boy.

00:37.776 --> 00:39.876
They don't take
as long to get ready.

00:39.878 --> 00:41.043
(laughs)

00:41.045 --> 00:42.645
What are you doing?

00:42.647 --> 00:45.081
I'm making the situation
better with humor.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.550
Are you?

00:48.653 --> 00:51.587
Would you rather me
make it better with magic?

00:51.589 --> 00:54.323
- Go back to sleep.
- Ta-da! (snaps fingers)

01:02.367 --> 01:04.834
You know, I hear
that sex can induce labor.

01:04.836 --> 01:07.003

I believe today is
Bernadette's due date.

01:35.021 --> 01:36.487
Yeah.

01:36.489 --> 01:37.689
How do you know that?

01:37.691 --> 01:41.159
Easy. 40 weeks from the date
of her last period.

01:42.796 --> 01:44.896
And why do you know that?

01:44.898 --> 01:48.099
Well, excuse me for taking
an interest in people.

01:49.235 --> 01:51.135
(scoffs softly)
So, any day now.

01:51.137 --> 01:52.437
Oh, I don't know.

01:52.439 --> 01:53.771
We went to the doctor
this morning,

01:53.773 --> 01:56.040
and she said it could still
be another week or two.

01:56.042 --> 01:58.009
How's Bernadette holding up?

01:58.011 --> 01:59.977
It's pretty rough.

01:59.979 --> 02:02.780
She's having a hard time.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.883
Why are you smiling?

02:05.885 --> 02:08.586
I had sex twice
last night.

02:08.588 --> 02:10.388
That's not fair!
She's on bed rest.

02:10.389 --> 02:12.190
She can't run away.

02:12.192 --> 02:14.192
It was her idea.

02:14.194 --> 02:16.160
She read that it
can start labor.

02:16.162 --> 02:17.628
Hmm. Is that true?

02:17.630 --> 02:18.963
Well, I would have Googled it,

02:18.965 --> 02:21.399
but I was busy
taking my pants off.

02:22.969 --> 02:25.770
Yeah, not to brag, but
Amy's last birthday

02:25.772 --> 02:28.139
brought my coital tally
up to four.

02:29.109 --> 02:31.409
Whatever you're doing,
it's not bragging.

02:32.812 --> 02:33.978
- Hey, guys.
- Hey. - Hey.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.279
- Hey.
- Hey, I was just

02:35.281 --> 02:36.347
talking about you.

02:36.349 --> 02:37.715
Oh, should I ask?

02:37.717 --> 02:39.817
You should not.

02:39.819 --> 02:42.153
I'm trying to get
our grant proposal together.

02:42.155 --> 02:43.721
Any chance you've finished up
those mechanical drawings?

02:43.723 --> 02:45.656
Oh, sorry.
I was gonna do it last night,

02:45.658 --> 02:46.891
but I got kind of busy.

02:46.893 --> 02:48.960
Yeah, you did.

02:50.497 --> 02:52.096
What are they talking about?

02:52.098 --> 02:53.364
I'll give
you a hint.

02:53.366 --> 02:56.434
It's something
that we have done four times.

02:56.436 --> 02:58.136
Watched <i>La La Land?</i>

02:58.138 --> 03:00.772
What? No. No.

03:00.774 --> 03:03.107
I've not watched
<i>La La Land</i> four times.

03:03.109 --> 03:05.076
If you find the
soundtrack on my phone,

03:05.078 --> 03:07.712
that's just 'cause
our iTunes accounts are linked.

03:08.848 --> 03:10.515
Looks like I might have
a little more time

03:10.517 --> 03:11.783
before the baby gets here,

03:11.785 --> 03:13.651
so why don't we just stay late
and get it done?

03:13.653 --> 03:15.953
Well, I don't want you
to leave Bernadette alone.

03:15.955 --> 03:17.755
Oh, we can hang out
and keep her company.

03:17.757 --> 03:20.158
- Yeah, absolutely.
- See, see. Look at my Netflix queue.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.125
There's two documentaries

03:21.127 --> 03:22.693
and the movie
<i>Friends with Benefits,</i>

03:22.695 --> 03:24.162
which I thought
was a documentary

03:24.164 --> 03:26.764
about employer
health care plans.

03:28.668 --> 03:31.068
PENNY:
Hey, Bernie, it's me.

03:31.070 --> 03:32.970
I let myself in.

03:32.972 --> 03:35.573
Hey.

03:35.575 --> 03:36.741
What are you doing?

03:36.743 --> 03:38.910
I thought you were supposed
to be on bed rest.

03:38.912 --> 03:40.545
That's done,
but I've been on stair rest

03:40.547 --> 03:42.246
for the last 45 minutes.

03:42.248 --> 03:44.148
Here, let me help you.
Yeah.

03:44.150 --> 03:46.484
If you really want to help,
put on a rubber glove,

03:46.486 --> 03:48.886
reach on up there
and start pulling.

03:48.888 --> 03:51.088
I know you're joking,
but I grew up on a farm.

03:51.090 --> 03:52.089
I'll do it.

03:52.091 --> 03:54.592
Oh, I just want
this to be over.

03:54.594 --> 03:56.661
You know, when
my yoga instructor was pregnant,

03:56.663 --> 03:58.596
she told me
there are tons of poses

03:58.598 --> 03:59.997
that put her right into labor.

03:59.999 --> 04:01.332
I'll try,

04:01.334 --> 04:04.735
but I feel like bendy poses
are what got me into this mess.

04:06.172 --> 04:09.507
Okay, we're gonna start with
some nice breathing exercises.

04:09.509 --> 04:11.409
(inhales, exhales)

04:11.411 --> 04:15.813
Sorry. I can't think of anything
except how flat your belly is.

04:15.815 --> 04:17.648
Oh, thank you.

04:17.649 --> 04:20.418
Go put on some more clothes,
you bitch.

04:25.658 --> 04:28.726
Okay, we go down...

04:28.728 --> 04:30.928
and back up.

04:35.168 --> 04:36.234
And back up!

04:36.236 --> 04:38.536
Yeah, hearing you
is not the problem.

04:41.307 --> 04:42.940
Put that phone away!

04:42.942 --> 04:44.108
Smile.

04:44.110 --> 04:46.510
(camera clicks)

04:46.512 --> 04:48.846
I'm telling you,
there's an acupressure point

04:48.848 --> 04:51.816
right above your ankle
that can induce contractions.

04:51.818 --> 04:53.684
All right, but
just a warning.

04:53.686 --> 04:55.286
My feet are a little swollen.

04:55.288 --> 04:56.687
Oh, please, Bernadette.

04:56.689 --> 04:58.990
I'm sure this-- okay.

05:00.260 --> 05:01.459
What?

05:01.461 --> 05:04.829
Nothing. Your ankles look fine,
and not at all

05:04.831 --> 05:07.531
like I just popped open
a can of crescent rolls.

05:09.602 --> 05:12.169
My mother believes that if
you're not prepared mentally,

05:12.171 --> 05:14.372
it can delay your body
from going into labor.

05:14.374 --> 05:16.741
So what are you trying to say?
It's my fault?

05:16.743 --> 05:18.242
(sighs)

05:18.244 --> 05:20.878
Raj is crazy.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.980
Your ankles aren't that gross.

05:27.854 --> 05:29.820
Hello.

05:29.822 --> 05:32.924
Let me guess. You're here to
try to get me to go into labor.

05:32.926 --> 05:35.893
Oh, please. I'm disgusted
when people sneeze,

05:35.895 --> 05:38.296
and that's just stuff
coming out of their nose.

05:38.298 --> 05:40.531
No.

05:40.533 --> 05:43.467
I am here to sit with you
and keep you company.

05:43.469 --> 05:44.902
Oh, that's nice.

05:44.904 --> 05:47.872
Yeah, by playing
the most complicated board game

05:47.874 --> 05:52.243
ever invented:
Campaign for North Africa.

05:52.245 --> 05:53.811
I bought it off eBay.

05:53.813 --> 05:57.114
It smells a little like chili,
but all the pieces are there.

05:58.751 --> 06:00.618
Come on, baby.

06:00.620 --> 06:03.721
Get out here right now
and I'll buy you a pony.

06:06.192 --> 06:09.226
Are there any engineers
on the grant committee?

06:09.228 --> 06:10.895
I don't know. Why?

06:10.897 --> 06:12.396
I didn't have time to figure out

06:12.398 --> 06:13.664
the three-input
hydraulic manifold,

06:13.666 --> 06:15.900
so this diagram is really just
a flux capacitor

06:15.902 --> 06:17.635
from <i>Back to the Future.</i>

06:17.637 --> 06:21.005
I'm sorry this is
on such short notice.

06:21.007 --> 06:23.641
Hey, I just wish I could be
there when you present it.

06:23.643 --> 06:25.076
That's okay.

06:25.078 --> 06:27.278
It's more important that
you spend time with Michael.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.447
Who's Michael?

06:30.616 --> 06:31.649
Uh, your son?

06:31.651 --> 06:33.451
No, it's not.
(chuckles)

06:33.453 --> 06:35.653
My son doesn't have a name yet.

06:39.359 --> 06:41.625
Okay, well, then,
Bernadette's son.

06:43.496 --> 06:44.862
I can't believe her.

06:44.864 --> 06:48.032
She knows I don't want
to name the baby after her dad.

06:48.034 --> 06:50.368
- What did you want to name him?
- I don't know.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.703
We were gonna wait until
we saw what he looked like.

06:52.705 --> 06:54.638
Well, it's a baby.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.173
Her dad's
a wrinkly bald man.

06:56.175 --> 06:58.309
That wasn't gonna
break your way.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:07.420 --> 07:09.820
Ah, come on!

07:11.557 --> 07:15.192
Welcome to the next five to
eight weeks of your life.

07:15.194 --> 07:17.795
Sheldon, I said
I didn't want to play your game.

07:17.797 --> 07:20.231
Well, then don't
think of it as a game.

07:20.233 --> 07:21.565
Think of it

07:21.567 --> 07:23.501
as a source of information

07:23.503 --> 07:27.171
about one of the lesser known
campaigns of World War II.

07:27.173 --> 07:28.906
You're right.

07:28.908 --> 07:30.875
That's so much better.

07:30.877 --> 07:32.843
I know, right?

07:32.845 --> 07:36.047
Okay, first, we need to roll
to determine the weather.

07:36.049 --> 07:39.183
It's a desert.
Isn't it gonna be hot?

07:51.364 --> 07:53.864
(humming)

07:53.866 --> 07:56.267
Yes.

07:59.572 --> 08:02.306
Michael? Really, you think
we're naming him Michael?

08:02.308 --> 08:03.941
Not now, Howard.

08:03.943 --> 08:06.911
I'm in the middle of a game.

08:06.913 --> 08:10.247
You wish. You are hundreds
of hours away from the middle.

08:15.338 --> 08:18.973
I can't believe you're trying
to hijack our son's name.

08:19.198 --> 08:21.765
Bernie?

08:22.768 --> 08:25.969
BERNADETTE: This is as fast
as I move! Calm down!

08:33.746 --> 08:35.679
So you're just gonna
name him Michael?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.547
Were you even
gonna tell me?

08:37.549 --> 08:38.948
I told you.

08:38.951 --> 08:40.517
When?

08:40.519 --> 08:43.320
Oh, right. That was Amy.

08:44.757 --> 08:47.424
What's wrong with Michael?
It's my dad's name.

08:47.426 --> 08:50.827
I don't want to name our son
after your father.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.733
I didn't want to say
this, but he's dying.

08:56.735 --> 08:59.236
He is?

08:59.238 --> 09:02.739
Eventually. I mean, you
see the way the man eats.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.709
Okay, is this the hormones,

09:05.711 --> 09:08.245
or have you always been
a lunatic?

09:08.247 --> 09:10.747
I don't even know anymore.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.851
Bernie, this is our kid's name.

09:14.853 --> 09:18.121
I think we should both agree.

09:18.123 --> 09:20.390
You're right. We
both made this baby.

09:20.392 --> 09:22.392
Thank you.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.294
And I carried it, had to
stay in bed for four months,

09:24.296 --> 09:25.662
sacrificed my body and my job,

09:25.664 --> 09:27.631
and soon it's gonna
burst its way out of me

09:27.633 --> 09:30.400
like the Kool-Aid Man.

09:30.402 --> 09:33.103
Exactly. Fifty-fifty.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.842
(quietly): I think I got
Bernadette in trouble.

09:38.844 --> 09:39.876
Maybe we should go.

09:39.878 --> 09:41.111
I-I can't.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.413
She and I are playing
Campaign for North Africa.

09:43.415 --> 09:44.581
(sighs)

09:44.583 --> 09:47.551
She doesn't want to play that.
Hmm?

09:47.553 --> 09:49.886
Neither did the Egyptians,
but that didn't stop Rommel.

09:49.888 --> 09:51.121
(door opens)

09:51.123 --> 09:54.091
Hey! I brought Chinese.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.293
And I brought Indian.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.529
What are you guys
doing here?

09:59.531 --> 10:00.497
Sheldon texted and said

10:00.499 --> 10:02.199
Bernadette wanted us all
to come over.

10:05.437 --> 10:09.039
The game's best with
five to ten players.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.144
Okay, if it's not Michael, then
what do you want to name him?

10:14.146 --> 10:17.314
Harry, like Potter or Houdini.

10:18.851 --> 10:20.384
It doesn't bother you that
I have an old boyfriend

10:20.386 --> 10:21.618
named Harry?

10:22.421 --> 10:24.688
Okay.
(clears throat)

10:24.690 --> 10:27.724
How 'bout Al or Max or...

10:27.726 --> 10:29.893
Ted or Kevin?

10:29.895 --> 10:31.561
Same answer.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.297
Hey, Bernadette,
it's your turn.

10:34.299 --> 10:35.499
Penny's air force

10:35.501 --> 10:38.802
is strafing
your supply line in Tobruk.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.103
We're kind of busy.

10:40.105 --> 10:42.773
Oh. 'Kay.
But you're being pretty rude.

10:42.775 --> 10:45.208
Everyone did come over
to play this game with you.

10:47.946 --> 10:51.148
You know, I always thought
Christian was a nice name.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.149
I don't know.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.886
Sounds a little
too uncircumcised.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.321
Bernadette, it's your turn.

10:58.323 --> 10:59.289
What about Greg?

10:59.291 --> 11:00.791
All right,
I'll just roll for you.

11:02.327 --> 11:04.294
Ooh! That is a good one!

11:04.296 --> 11:06.696
Your troops' morale rating
is pretty high.

11:06.698 --> 11:08.432
Now, Leonard, as the defender,

11:08.434 --> 11:10.500
we need to subtract
your morale rating

11:10.502 --> 11:11.902
from Bernadette's
to get a final

11:11.904 --> 11:13.703
adjusted morale rating
for the assault.

11:13.705 --> 11:16.740
And I will just check
the assault differential column.

11:16.742 --> 11:19.743
Ooh! Who said war was hell?

11:20.813 --> 11:21.845
Yeah, that's
a rhetorical question.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.647
Sherman said it.

11:23.649 --> 11:24.648
What about Sherman?

11:24.650 --> 11:26.550
Like, Sherman Wolowitz.

11:26.552 --> 11:30.120
Yeah, that's a kid who's gonna
take his mother to prom.

11:31.356 --> 11:33.323
Hey, Howard,
you did that, right?

11:34.259 --> 11:37.227
I didn't take her.
She chaperoned.

11:37.229 --> 11:40.397
(chuckles)
We slow-danced once.

11:41.467 --> 11:43.200
What about Paul?

11:43.202 --> 11:46.169
Paul. Paul Wolowitz.

11:46.171 --> 11:47.671
I like it.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.639
Ooh, like "Koothra-Paul-i."

11:51.076 --> 11:53.510
Okay, you ruined it.

11:54.713 --> 11:57.380
All right, that moves us on
to the tactical shipping phase.

11:57.382 --> 12:00.383
Penny, I believe, as
logistics commander, that's you.

12:00.385 --> 12:03.520
Okay. I surrender.

12:03.522 --> 12:05.021
Nice try, Penny.

12:05.023 --> 12:07.090
It takes more
than everybody not enjoying it

12:07.092 --> 12:09.493
to stop a game
with Sheldon Cooper.

12:10.762 --> 12:12.596
Sheldon, we're talking
about something important here.

12:12.598 --> 12:13.964
(sighs)
Fine.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.500
If you pick a baby name,
can we get back to playing?

12:16.502 --> 12:17.300
Sure.

12:17.302 --> 12:18.435
All right, here we go.

12:18.437 --> 12:19.970
Ranatanata.

12:22.407 --> 12:24.341
You can't name him Ranatanata.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.576
Oh, right, it's a boy.
That'd be ridiculous.

12:26.578 --> 12:27.511
(gasps)

12:27.513 --> 12:29.646
What about Ozymandias?

12:29.648 --> 12:33.783
Are you making these up
or having a stroke?

12:33.785 --> 12:37.320
Ozymandias is from a poem
by Percy Bysshe Shelley.

12:37.322 --> 12:39.289
Oh, oh! Bysshe Wolowitz.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.891
Solved. Back to the game.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.394
Heyo! Sandstorm!

12:46.165 --> 12:48.598
Some people name their
kids after places.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.568
Like what, Walla
Walla Wolowitz?

12:53.505 --> 12:56.540
If you think that is better
than Ozymandias Wolowitz,

12:56.542 --> 12:58.108
then you have been breathing in
the poisonous gas

12:58.110 --> 12:59.976
that my troops
illegally dispersed.

12:59.978 --> 13:01.545
Ooh!

13:01.547 --> 13:02.779
You okay?

13:02.781 --> 13:04.447
Uh, I think that was
a contraction.

13:04.449 --> 13:07.450
Is it time? Do we need
to go to the hospital?

13:07.452 --> 13:08.485
No. We've been
through this before.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.554
My water
hasn't even broken yet.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.755
Never mind your water.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.191
Has your mucus plug popped out?

13:15.127 --> 13:16.326
Ew, no!

13:16.328 --> 13:17.460
SHELDON:
Oh, you're right.

13:17.462 --> 13:19.496
We probably would've heard that.

13:19.498 --> 13:20.697
It's not a champagne cork.

13:20.699 --> 13:24.768
Although that
would be festive.

13:24.770 --> 13:26.269
You know what,
maybe we should go.

13:26.271 --> 13:28.004
Did you have
another contraction?

13:28.006 --> 13:29.606
No. I'm just worried
that Sheldon's gonna say

13:29.608 --> 13:31.942
"mucus plug" again.

13:31.944 --> 13:35.679
And I'm worried
one's gonna hit me in the eye.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.680
Yep, it's time.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.215
Should we take
two cars?

13:38.217 --> 13:40.250
Uh, actually, could you
stay here and watch Halley?

13:40.252 --> 13:42.352
That way we don't have to wait
for Bernadette's parents.

13:42.354 --> 13:43.553
Yeah, you guys go.
We'll take care of her.

13:43.555 --> 13:45.522
You have nothing
to worry about.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.958
Well, not nothing.
There are U-boats approaching

13:47.960 --> 13:50.393
the Suez Canal.

13:50.395 --> 13:51.962
It's too late for us.
Go, go!

13:51.964 --> 13:54.130
Save yourselves!

13:55.200 --> 13:58.268
Suez? Birth?
It's a big night for canals.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.241
How you feeling?

14:04.243 --> 14:05.508
Eh.

14:05.510 --> 14:09.112
But I am really excited
to meet our son.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.948
Me, too. I thought
I'd be super freaked out.

14:11.950 --> 14:15.252
But I'm ready for this.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.487
Well, not the part
where you're in labor

14:17.489 --> 14:20.557
and you squeeze my fingers
till they turn blue. (chuckles)

14:20.559 --> 14:22.092
I'm sorry.

14:22.094 --> 14:25.795
That must be
really painful for you.

14:26.632 --> 14:27.797
It is.

14:27.799 --> 14:29.266
I mean, last time, I...

14:29.268 --> 14:30.267
Okay,

14:30.269 --> 14:32.102
I see what you're doing.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.338
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
(groans, hisses)

14:35.340 --> 14:36.906
It's a big one.

14:36.908 --> 14:38.875
Just breathe.
(moans, hisses)

14:38.877 --> 14:41.811
(panting)
Okay.

14:41.813 --> 14:44.114
Okay, I'm good.

14:45.183 --> 14:48.351
I'm sorry I tried
to sneak the name past you.

14:48.353 --> 14:49.552
That's okay.

14:49.554 --> 14:53.423
I'm sorry I used up
so many good names in college.

14:54.793 --> 14:58.528
I was really competitive
with my roommate.

15:00.065 --> 15:02.132
Forget about it.
(chuckles)

15:02.134 --> 15:04.434
Please.

15:06.204 --> 15:07.370
You know what,

15:07.372 --> 15:09.306
maybe we're putting
too much pressure on this.

15:09.308 --> 15:10.674
It doesn't matter
what we name him.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.275
He's gonna be amazing.

15:12.277 --> 15:13.777
You're right.

15:13.779 --> 15:17.080
This kid is part
you and part me.

15:17.082 --> 15:21.051
Yeah. He's gonna be smart
and kind and funny.

15:21.053 --> 15:23.286
If he cracks five-foot-six,
it'll be a miracle.

15:25.857 --> 15:27.824
I've always liked
the name Elliott.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.393
Sorry, can't have it.
That's my boy name.

15:30.395 --> 15:31.728
I said it first.

15:31.730 --> 15:33.697
It's not like calling dibs.

15:33.699 --> 15:35.532
Yes, it is.
It's exactly like that.

15:35.534 --> 15:37.534
Dibs on Elliott.

15:37.536 --> 15:40.170
I-I'm just saying,
we might get there first.

15:40.172 --> 15:41.671
You only have sex
once a year.

15:41.673 --> 15:43.340
I'll probably
have sex tonight.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.410
Fine, you can have Elliott.

15:48.380 --> 15:51.281
When did you pick out
our kids' names?

15:51.283 --> 15:53.283
Remember that day
you moved into the building?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.951
(chuckles)
Yes.

15:55.854 --> 16:00.056
A non-creepy amount of time
after that.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.892
Yeah, I like the name Elliott.

16:02.894 --> 16:04.728
That wasn't on my
list, but I like it.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.697
We've heard your names.
They're ridiculous.

16:07.699 --> 16:10.700
And I have a cousin named Dilip.

16:10.702 --> 16:13.436
Well, I wasn't going to give
them any of the good names.

16:13.438 --> 16:15.205
I'm saving those for us.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.274
Really? You've thought
about our kids?

16:18.276 --> 16:21.678
Of course. I think you and I
will have exceptional children.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.380
Aw.

16:23.382 --> 16:25.648
Well, I think so, too.

16:25.650 --> 16:27.350
How many kids do you guys want?

16:27.352 --> 16:29.819
- Two.
- 15.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.956
- What?
- (stammers) Don't worry.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.991
I don't expect you
to bear them all.

16:34.993 --> 16:38.395
I'm sure we can find a
suitable uterus to rent.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.365
- No!
- Uh-uh!

16:42.367 --> 16:44.434
We weren't thinking
about you.

16:44.436 --> 16:45.769
Of course not.
(grunts)

16:45.771 --> 16:47.203
I am going to
the kitchen.

16:47.205 --> 16:48.505
Can I get anybody anything?

16:48.507 --> 16:49.939
Penny, nice glass of milk

16:49.941 --> 16:52.342
and a multivitamin?

17:01.834 --> 17:03.734
SHELDON:
Guys.

17:03.736 --> 17:05.402
Guys, wake up.

17:05.404 --> 17:06.303
Terrible news.

17:06.305 --> 17:07.605
Oh, my God.
What, what, what?

17:07.607 --> 17:08.571
Is it the baby?

17:08.574 --> 17:10.007
No. No, no, we miscalculated

17:10.009 --> 17:11.742
our unassigned
armor class units.

17:11.743 --> 17:13.377
We need to start over.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.079
What?

17:15.080 --> 17:16.313
Oh, no, no, no,
not from the beginning.

17:16.315 --> 17:18.048
Just from when the tanks
started moving.

17:18.050 --> 17:20.651
(sighs)
That was five hours ago.

17:20.653 --> 17:23.220
Mm, no.
No, that was two hours ago.

17:23.222 --> 17:25.823
It only feels like five.

17:25.825 --> 17:27.023
What time is it?

17:27.026 --> 17:28.492
It's almost 2:30.

17:28.493 --> 17:30.027
Don't you think
we should've heard something?

17:30.029 --> 17:31.529
I'm sure they're fine.

17:31.531 --> 17:33.197
I'm calling them.
(clears throat)

17:33.199 --> 17:35.833
(line ringing)

17:35.835 --> 17:36.901
Hey!
(chuckles)

17:36.903 --> 17:37.968
Hey, everything okay?

17:37.970 --> 17:41.405
Yeah! The baby was born
about an hour ago.

17:41.407 --> 17:44.341
(gasps) Dude, why didn't
you call me?!

17:44.343 --> 17:47.177
(chuckles) The only way I would
see my son for the first time

17:47.179 --> 17:49.346
and immediately think
"I need to call Raj"

17:49.348 --> 17:51.815
is if he came out brown.

17:52.885 --> 17:55.586
You know, it can take some time
for pigment to form.

17:55.588 --> 17:57.221
You're still not
out of the woods.

17:57.223 --> 17:58.219
Congratulations!

17:58.243 --> 17:59.640
Yeah. Hey,
what'd you name him?

18:00.326 --> 18:01.859
Neil Michael.

18:01.861 --> 18:03.861
Neil for Armstrong,

18:03.863 --> 18:05.229
Gaiman, and Diamond.

18:05.231 --> 18:08.999
Michael because Bernie
had to get six stitches.

18:09.001 --> 18:11.335
Neil-- that's cute.

18:11.337 --> 18:12.970
BERNADETTE:
But we're calling him Michael!

18:12.972 --> 18:14.838
(sighs)
I'm not gonna fight her.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.608
That kid's head was the size
of a cantaloupe.
