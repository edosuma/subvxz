I just can't believe it.
We stopped King Sombra.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.716
You and me and all
of our friends.

14:44.718 --> 14:48.219
But we aren't friends.
At least not here.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.420
Right.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.491
Look, I hope all this helped,

14:53.493 --> 14:56.728
but I really need to get
back to canning those apples.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.465
Thank you. We're going
to set things right.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.000
I hope you do.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.604
So. How are we going
to set things right?

15:06.606 --> 15:07.739
I DON'T KNOW!

15:09.308 --> 15:11.009
The only thing we know for sure

15:11.011 --> 15:13.211
is that Starlight
stopped the Rainboom.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.347
And that the
map's still here.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.749
Spike! That's it!

15:17.751 --> 15:20.084
The map is connected to
the Tree of Harmony.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.053
It must sense that
something isn't right.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.155
That's why it's still here.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.124
I'll just use Starlight's
version of the spell

15:26.126 --> 15:27.558
and go back a little earlier

15:27.560 --> 15:30.528
and stop her before she
even knows we're there!

15:30.530 --> 15:36.734
[whoosh]

15:41.206 --> 15:43.041
Aaaah!

15:43.043 --> 15:45.376
All we have to do now is
find Starlight and st-

15:45.378 --> 15:46.544
[zap]

15:50.082 --> 15:52.750
Well, finding her
will be easy.

15:52.752 --> 15:57.322
But stopping her's going to
be harder than you think!

15:57.324 --> 16:00.024
Sorry to disappoint you,
but I created that spell

16:00.026 --> 16:02.427
to send myself back in time.

16:02.429 --> 16:07.065
So even when you cast it, I
still get sent back here.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.534
It wasn't difficult to
change Starswirl's spell;

16:09.536 --> 16:11.402
he'd already done the hard part.

16:11.404 --> 16:15.707
But figuring out I could use the
map to go to any time or place

16:15.709 --> 16:17.608
and pull you along with me?

16:17.610 --> 16:21.312
Ha ha! I even impressed
myself with that.

16:21.314 --> 16:25.750
I knew you'd try to stop
me. You're so predictable.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.186
Why else would I leave
the scroll behind?

16:28.188 --> 16:30.989
Touching it triggered
the map to whisk you here

16:30.991 --> 16:33.491
and watch me erase
the one thing

16:33.493 --> 16:36.361
that linked
you with your friends.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.163
My village was a
sanctuary of equality

16:39.165 --> 16:42.433
where no pony's cutie mark
allowed them to feel superior.

16:42.435 --> 16:47.205
It was a special place, and you
and your friends took it away.

16:51.443 --> 16:54.679
Now it's my turn to take
something special from you.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.583
Without the Rainboom, you and
your friends will never form

16:58.585 --> 17:01.152
your special cutie mark bond.

17:01.154 --> 17:05.623
Cutie marks for cutie marks.
Sounds like a fair trade to me.

17:23.175 --> 17:27.078
Spike: Twilight!

17:27.080 --> 17:28.046
Whoops!

17:29.048 --> 17:31.282
[panicked yells]

17:32.584 --> 17:33.584
Thanks.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.119
No problem, Spike.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.555
At least now we know
exactly what we have to do.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.735
OK. Keep your eyes peeled.

17:50.737 --> 17:51.736
Right.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.673
as soon as Rainbow Dash
and those bullies race by.

17:57.176 --> 17:58.209
Um, Twilight...

17:58.211 --> 17:59.577
So be ready.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.545
I know, but...

18:00.547 --> 18:02.346
Because she could
pop up anywhere.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.083
Like over there?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.353
Just remember
how you'd feel

18:09.355 --> 18:11.389
if someone said
those things to you.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.392
What's going on here?

18:14.394 --> 18:17.061
Oh, I was just reminding
these two colts

18:17.063 --> 18:19.497
how hurtful teasing can be.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.698
Well, don't!

18:20.700 --> 18:22.433
Huh?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.204
I mean... You were?

18:26.206 --> 18:30.074
Of course. In a world where
every pony is unique,

18:30.076 --> 18:34.045
some are bound to feel
more special than others.

18:34.047 --> 18:37.548
But that isn't a licence
to be cruel is it?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.685
No. Of course not.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.087
Isn't it a shame
we don't live in a world

18:43.089 --> 18:45.423
where everypony is equal.

18:45.425 --> 18:49.694
No one would ever tease anyone
there. Wouldn't that be nice?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.329
Mm hm!

18:51.331 --> 18:53.364
No. It wouldn't!

18:53.366 --> 18:56.601
I mean, it'd be nice not
to be teased, of course,

18:56.603 --> 18:59.170
but that's not the same thing.

18:59.172 --> 19:01.005
Come on, Fluttershy.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.407
Maybe I can help you get
through the course this time.

19:03.409 --> 19:07.211
Well, I sure could
use the practice.

19:10.015 --> 19:12.617
I know you only convinced those
bullies to not tease Fluttershy

19:12.619 --> 19:14.352
to stop the Rainboom.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.955
Oh, that's not true. I convinced
them not to be bullies

19:17.957 --> 19:20.725
because everypony
should be equal.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.961
Stopping the Rainboom
is just a bonus.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.396

If you say so.

Hi!

19:40.212 --> 19:42.180
Um, hi.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.981
You think you can
stop for a minute?

19:43.983 --> 19:44.715
Sure!

19:46.151 --> 19:48.186
I hear you're pretty fast.

19:48.188 --> 19:52.056
Pretty fast? Please. I'm
even faster than that.

19:52.058 --> 19:55.593
OK, so, um... Hey
you wanna race?

19:55.595 --> 19:57.995
Um. That wouldn't
really be fair.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.064
I mean, you're
a full grown pony.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.767
And, wait, are
you an Alicorn?

20:02.769 --> 20:04.702
Come on, I thought
you were fast.

20:07.406 --> 20:11.275
Actually, I just remembered I
have somewhere I need to be.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.279
OK, listen. You don't
have to race me.

20:15.281 --> 20:18.482
I just need you to fly fast
enough for a Sonic Rainboom.

20:18.484 --> 20:21.752
What? I can't do
that. Nopony can.

20:21.754 --> 20:25.089
It's not even a real thing.
It's just an old mare's tale.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.791
But it's not! I
know it's not.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.759
I've seen you do it.
In the future!

20:30.696 --> 20:34.465
OK. I'm gonna go now.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.200
No! Wait!

20:39.638 --> 20:42.406
Gee, Twilight.
What's the matter?

20:42.408 --> 20:47.778
Couldn't convince her to do the
impossible? That's too bad.

harder than I thought.

We'll have to try again.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.330
Hey, Twilight.

21:06.332 --> 21:09.166
I don't want to live in
that awful future we saw.
