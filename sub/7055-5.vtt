WEBVTT

00:00.135 --> 00:01.763
The first attacks were
three days ago.

00:01.921 --> 00:03.417
All we know is their
hearts stopped.

00:03.538 --> 00:05.101
Previously on Fringe...

00:05.220 --> 00:06.833
Does this remind
you of anything?

00:06.868 --> 00:08.468
Biological-mechanical hybrid--

00:08.519 --> 00:10.320
These are different.
They're human.

00:10.404 --> 00:12.989
And for whatever reason,
they don't work.

00:13.074 --> 00:14.307
Walter?

00:14.358 --> 00:15.825
It's all right.

00:15.910 --> 00:17.310
The area is completely numb.

00:17.361 --> 00:19.446
What are you seeing?

00:19.497 --> 00:21.081
A person, a young man.

00:21.148 --> 00:23.950
Does he look like this?

00:24.018 --> 00:25.919
Father and son
just pulled a man

00:25.986 --> 00:27.287
from the middle of Reiden lake.

00:27.338 --> 00:30.006
Whoever he is knows a lot
of classified information--

00:30.091 --> 00:32.709
Things no one outside this
division could possibly know.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.344
Olivia.

00:34.428 --> 00:36.846
<i>Thank God</i> <i>you're here.</i>

00:36.931 --> 00:37.964
Who are you?

01:32.153 --> 01:34.487
Walter?

01:36.824 --> 01:38.358
Astrid?

01:49.920 --> 01:52.505
<i>Walter?</i>

01:53.841 --> 01:57.594
Walter?

01:57.678 --> 01:58.595
Walter.

02:03.517 --> 02:05.918
- What the hell are you doing?
- Sleeping.

02:05.970 --> 02:09.271
One syringe has
sodium thiopental--

02:09.357 --> 02:11.891
- Well, that sounds--
- It's a barbiturate, yes.

02:11.942 --> 02:13.926
I was going
to say "dangerous."

02:13.978 --> 02:14.978
Nonsense.

02:15.062 --> 02:17.263
And I have the adrenaline
to wake me up.

02:17.314 --> 02:19.399
Who sleeps like this?

02:19.450 --> 02:20.933
Well, what choice do I have?

02:20.985 --> 02:23.936
Ah, I've been haunted for weeks

02:23.988 --> 02:26.322
with visions of a strange man.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.575
And now the stranger
is here in the flesh,

02:28.626 --> 02:30.827
in our midst, and no one
will let me examine him

02:30.911 --> 02:32.111
or even see him.

02:32.163 --> 02:34.214
I'm kept in the dark,
knowing nothing.

02:34.281 --> 02:35.915
How's a man supposed
to get some rest

02:35.966 --> 02:38.301
with all these uncertainties?

02:42.156 --> 02:43.089
Is he talking?

02:43.157 --> 02:44.257
No.

02:44.308 --> 02:46.076
He was, but he stopped
cooperating with us

02:46.143 --> 02:47.260
at the hospital.

02:47.311 --> 02:48.978
Broyles moved him
to a holding facility

02:49.063 --> 02:52.098
in the federal building.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.901
Walter, he says that you're
the only one he'll speak to.

02:54.968 --> 02:57.654
Me?

02:57.738 --> 03:00.774
He's saying that his name
is Peter Bishop.

03:00.825 --> 03:04.611
<i>He says</i> <i>he's your son.</i>

03:24.381 --> 03:25.965
<i>Hello?</i>

03:30.354 --> 03:31.387
Hi.

03:33.441 --> 03:37.393
I thought you said
you hated that sweater.

03:37.478 --> 03:41.731
I thought I'd give it
a second chance.

03:41.816 --> 03:44.150
What's all this?

03:44.201 --> 03:46.686
Looks like a cyclone
went through here.

03:46.737 --> 03:49.823
I can't find
the electric bill.

03:52.243 --> 03:54.327
<i>You okay?</i>

03:54.378 --> 03:55.745
<i>Yeah.</i>

03:57.465 --> 03:59.299
You're probably hungry.

03:59.366 --> 04:02.252
I should start dinner.

04:02.336 --> 04:05.505
<i>I'll be right down.</i>

04:47.765 --> 04:50.350
Karen?

04:50.417 --> 04:52.418
What are you doing?

04:58.108 --> 05:00.476
Y-your face.

05:03.197 --> 05:05.281
Are you sick?

05:05.366 --> 05:08.151
W-what's wrong
with your skin?

05:08.235 --> 05:09.602
K-Karen, w-what's--

05:09.653 --> 05:11.321
Your research files,
are they in the safe?

05:11.405 --> 05:12.705
- What?
- Your files--

05:12.773 --> 05:14.924
<i>Where are they?</i>

05:14.992 --> 05:17.610
<i>Karen!</i>

05:17.661 --> 05:19.746
Dear God.

05:21.465 --> 05:23.449
Oh, no.

05:25.619 --> 05:27.136
What the hell are you?

05:27.221 --> 05:29.556
I'm only going
to ask this once.

05:29.623 --> 05:32.258
Tell me where the files are.

05:32.309 --> 05:33.927
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:33.978 --> 05:36.095
Aah!

05:39.092 --> 05:45.049
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

05:58.703 --> 06:01.723
What makes you think
there's any basis to his claims?

06:01.807 --> 06:03.257
We were able to obtain
a DNA sample

06:03.342 --> 06:05.343
from his I.V.
at the hospital.

06:05.394 --> 06:07.345
There's a 99.7%
probability

06:07.396 --> 06:10.231
that this man is, in fact,
related to you.

06:10.315 --> 06:12.066
We discovered another universe.

06:12.151 --> 06:13.551
There's no reason that
there shouldn't be

06:13.602 --> 06:16.487
more out there we-
we're yet to find.

06:16.555 --> 06:19.073
Logic would dictate
that this man

06:19.158 --> 06:21.275
could be another
version of my so--

06:21.360 --> 06:24.728
Another version of Peter
from a third universe

06:24.780 --> 06:26.497
where he didn't die as a boy.

06:26.565 --> 06:28.116
Walter, people
from other universes

06:28.200 --> 06:29.450
don't just show up
in your dreams.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.786
He asked for my theory.

06:31.870 --> 06:33.904
I never claimed
it was flawless.

06:33.956 --> 06:35.923
In any case,
how did he get here?

06:37.576 --> 06:39.677
The only way to find out
is to ask him.

06:39.744 --> 06:43.097
My thoughts precisely.

06:43.182 --> 06:46.750
We prepared
a list of questions.

06:46.802 --> 06:49.220
This man possesses a lot
of classified information

06:49.271 --> 06:50.638
about our division
and all of us.

06:50.722 --> 06:53.691
I want to know how he got it.

06:53.758 --> 06:56.444
Look, I'm-I'm fairly sure
I'm not the one

06:56.528 --> 06:57.945
best suited to this.

06:58.030 --> 06:59.280
You will be fine, Walter.

06:59.364 --> 07:00.731
We'll be listening
on the room's intercom.

07:00.783 --> 07:02.316
So, if at any point
you want to leave,

07:02.401 --> 07:03.785
you just have to say so.

07:12.611 --> 07:15.580
Hello, Walter.

07:46.995 --> 07:49.147
You don't know
who I am, do you?

07:55.120 --> 07:58.039
I know this must be
confusing for you.

07:58.123 --> 07:59.957
But something's happened.

08:00.008 --> 08:01.926
<i>And you're the only person</i>
<i>who can help me.</i>

08:01.993 --> 08:03.177
What do you want from me?

08:03.262 --> 08:05.930
I need you to help me figure out
why no one remembers me,

08:05.997 --> 08:08.466
<i>why you</i> <i>don't remember me.</i>

08:11.303 --> 08:13.471
I'll try.

08:17.309 --> 08:19.110
There are two
universes...

08:19.177 --> 08:21.529
Ours over here
a-and another one

08:21.613 --> 08:24.031
that's just like it,
just slightly different.

08:24.116 --> 08:25.783
The other universe is dying.

08:25.850 --> 08:28.152
<i>And because</i>
<i>they're interconnected,</i>

08:28.220 --> 08:29.353
<i>ours is dying as well.</i>

08:29.404 --> 08:30.538
How does he know all this?

08:30.622 --> 08:32.289
<i>So you built</i>
<i>a machine to save us,</i>

08:32.357 --> 08:34.041
to form a bridge
between the two worlds

08:34.126 --> 08:36.527
so that we could work together
to heal them both.

08:36.578 --> 08:39.080
<i>And you created it so that</i>
<i>I was the power source.</i>

08:39.164 --> 08:41.215
Only I could activate it,
but you told me that when I did, / No.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.500
<i>there would be</i> <i>consequences.</i>

08:42.551 --> 08:45.553
There is a machine,
but I didn't build it.

08:45.637 --> 08:48.539
I don't know who you are,
what your agenda is,

08:48.590 --> 08:50.558
or why you you claim
to be my son.

08:50.642 --> 08:52.426
Do you have a son, Walter?

08:52.511 --> 08:54.812
<i>You and Elizabeth,</i>
<i>did you have a son?</i>

08:54.879 --> 08:56.764
Yes.

08:59.151 --> 09:00.568
He died...

09:00.652 --> 09:02.886
A long time ago,
when he was just a boy.

09:02.938 --> 09:04.355
And then you found
another version of him

09:04.406 --> 09:06.607
in the other universe.

09:06.692 --> 09:08.559
And he was dying, too.

09:08.610 --> 09:11.245
So you crossed over
to save him.

09:11.330 --> 09:15.366
Yes.
But I couldn't.

09:16.969 --> 09:18.502
What do you mean you couldn't?

09:18.570 --> 09:24.508
That lake where
we crossed over was frozen.

09:24.576 --> 09:28.746
The ice broke.
We fell through.

09:28.814 --> 09:32.082
I tried to hold on to him...

09:32.134 --> 09:34.468
But he drowned.

09:36.138 --> 09:40.358
The observer didn't pull us
out of the lake that night?

09:41.777 --> 09:43.527
Well, that-that must be it, Walter.

09:43.595 --> 09:44.729
What's an observer?

09:44.780 --> 09:46.314
<i>It all makes sense now.</i>

09:46.398 --> 09:49.116
That has to be what happened.

09:49.201 --> 09:50.901
I was supposed to die

09:50.953 --> 09:52.536
that night in both universes,

09:52.604 --> 09:54.972
but when I didn't,
I became a paradox,

09:55.040 --> 09:57.325
and now, for the two
worlds to heal,

09:57.409 --> 09:58.826
I had to be deleted.

09:58.910 --> 10:00.944
But i-i... if I'm already dead
in both universes,

10:00.996 --> 10:02.780
then why am I here?
How am I back?

10:02.831 --> 10:05.466
Something's gone wrong, Walter.
Something's happened.

10:05.550 --> 10:06.467
We're finished here.

10:06.551 --> 10:07.718
<i>Take me back</i> <i>to my lab.</i>

10:07.786 --> 10:09.837
Please, I'd like to go now!

10:09.921 --> 10:11.005
- No, please, I need your help. Walter.
- I want to leave!

10:11.089 --> 10:12.139
Walter, I need your help.

10:12.224 --> 10:13.641
You have to help me
figure out what went wrong.

10:13.725 --> 10:16.394
If I'm not supposed to be
here, then how am I back?

10:22.851 --> 10:26.136
Dunham.

10:26.188 --> 10:27.355
Where are you?

10:29.524 --> 10:31.826
You want to tell me
why you dragged me

10:31.910 --> 10:32.860
to a robbery-homicide?

10:32.944 --> 10:34.412
Victim's skin is translucent.

10:34.479 --> 10:36.080
<i>Since Robert's murder,</i>

10:36.147 --> 10:37.665
<i>I've been keeping up</i>
<i>with local police bulletins,</i>

10:37.749 --> 10:39.500
looking for anything
that came across the wire

10:39.584 --> 10:40.651
with a similar MO.

10:40.702 --> 10:42.820
See, I thought we killed
the last of these things

10:42.871 --> 10:44.472
- at the train yards.
- Apparently not.

10:44.539 --> 10:47.124
<i>Her heart was stopped,</i>
<i>same as the others.</i>

10:47.175 --> 10:48.959
<i>I think the shapeshifter</i>
<i>took on the wife's form</i>

10:49.011 --> 10:50.428
to get access to the home.

10:50.495 --> 10:52.263
I ran background
on the victims.

10:52.330 --> 10:54.998
You are standing in the home
of Dr. Malcolm Truss...

10:55.050 --> 10:56.684
A research scientist

10:56.768 --> 10:57.968
<i>who worked</i> <i>at Massive Dynamic</i>

10:58.020 --> 10:59.503
<i>in their biotech</i> <i>department.</i>

10:59.554 --> 11:01.822
Left the company 10 years ago.

11:01.890 --> 11:03.457
Huh. Interesting.

11:03.525 --> 11:04.942
He was tortured,
so he must have known

11:05.009 --> 11:07.778
something
the shapeshifter wanted.

11:07.846 --> 11:09.814
There's grease
under his fingernail--

11:09.865 --> 11:10.815
Fingernails.

11:10.866 --> 11:12.400
Yeah, I know.

11:12.484 --> 11:14.952
Not too many bio-scientists
work at garages.

11:15.019 --> 11:16.737
So this is...

11:16.822 --> 11:19.790
Mrs. Truss' unlucky boyfriend,
Donald Kellen.

11:19.858 --> 11:21.709
Dr. Truss doesn't live
here anymore.

11:21.793 --> 11:23.327
<i>They separated</i> <i>a few years ago,</i>

11:23.378 --> 11:25.212
<i>but the house is</i>
<i>still in his name.</i>

11:25.297 --> 11:27.631
So the shapeshifter came
here looking for Truss,

11:27.699 --> 11:29.417
didn't find him, which
means it's still looking.

11:29.501 --> 11:31.469
Problem is,
we can't find him either.

11:31.536 --> 11:34.872
After they separated, uh,
Dr. Truss went off the grid.

11:34.923 --> 11:36.807
We're still trying to pull
an address for him.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.427
Well, we should hurry on that.

11:40.712 --> 11:43.547
<i>♪ Oh, baby ♪</i>

11:43.615 --> 11:46.016
♪ what you gonna do ♪

11:46.068 --> 11:48.102
♪ when the water's all gone? ♪

11:48.186 --> 11:50.387
♪ tell me, baby ♪

11:52.691 --> 11:54.558
Hey, Sebastian.

11:58.497 --> 12:00.030
<i>Malcolm Truss?</i>

12:00.082 --> 12:01.916
You're Dr. Malcolm Truss?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.834
<i>You worked</i>
<i>at Massive Dynamic, correct?</i>

12:03.902 --> 12:06.236
Okay, look, I-I-I don't know
who you are, young lady,

12:06.288 --> 12:07.237
but I suggest you leave.

12:07.289 --> 12:10.374
You are trespassing
on priv--

12:11.927 --> 12:15.196
I'm gonna need your help.

12:21.964 --> 12:23.148
<i>Hey, Olivia.</i>

12:23.215 --> 12:25.517
<i>This photo, the girl</i>
<i>with the riding ribbon--</i>

12:25.601 --> 12:28.186
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

12:28.270 --> 12:30.171
Okay.

12:30.222 --> 12:32.557
You, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

12:32.641 --> 12:35.026
W-why does Nina Sharp

12:35.110 --> 12:38.196
have your photo in her office?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.448
After our mother died,
my sister and I

12:40.516 --> 12:43.017
were due to go
into the foster system.

12:43.068 --> 12:46.404
Instead, Nina pulled
some strings, and uh...

12:46.489 --> 12:48.523
We went to live with her.

12:48.574 --> 12:50.208
So the acting c.E.O.

12:50.292 --> 12:53.495
Of one of the richest
companies in...

12:53.546 --> 12:56.998
The world was your nanny?

12:57.049 --> 12:58.132
Something like that.

13:01.136 --> 13:02.253
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting.</i>

13:02.338 --> 13:03.371
Nina Sharp.

13:03.422 --> 13:05.390
You must be Agent Lee.

13:05.474 --> 13:07.175
Phillip tells me that

13:07.226 --> 13:08.376
you're a very welcome
addition to our team.

13:08.427 --> 13:10.345
Lincoln.
It's nice to meet you.

13:10.396 --> 13:12.897
Phillip also told me about the
man claiming to be Peter Bishop.

13:12.982 --> 13:15.049
How's Walter handling it?

13:15.100 --> 13:16.067
Not very well.

13:16.151 --> 13:17.519
Oh, that's unfortunate.

13:17.570 --> 13:19.153
Is there anything
I can do to help?

13:19.221 --> 13:21.189
I don't think so.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.741
Uh, we're here
on a different matter, though.

13:23.826 --> 13:25.410
Dr. Malcolm Truss?

13:25.494 --> 13:27.579
He used to work
for Massive Dynamic,

13:27.663 --> 13:30.415
but he left the company
maybe ten years ago.

13:30.499 --> 13:31.899
No name doesn't ring a bell.

13:31.951 --> 13:33.251
Let's see what we can find.

13:33.335 --> 13:35.920
<i>Ah, I remember Dr. Truss.</i>

13:36.005 --> 13:38.256
Graduated MIT in '82,

13:38.340 --> 13:40.041
came to work for us in 1993,

13:40.092 --> 13:41.075
left in 2001.

13:41.126 --> 13:43.378
What kind of projects
was he working on?

13:43.429 --> 13:44.846
Well, several.

13:44.913 --> 13:46.631
Perhaps if you told me
why you're interested in him,

13:46.715 --> 13:47.966
I might be a better help.

13:48.050 --> 13:51.352
Uh, he was abducted from his house
in Vermont this morning,

13:51.420 --> 13:54.055
and we think a shapeshifter
was responsible.

13:54.106 --> 13:55.423
A shapeshifter?

13:55.474 --> 13:59.060
But what would a shapeshifter
want with Malcolm Truss?

13:59.111 --> 14:03.598
We were hoping
you could tell us.

14:03.649 --> 14:06.484
There was one project
Malcolm was working on.

14:06.552 --> 14:07.986
<i>Cellular replication.</i>

14:08.070 --> 14:11.406
It was designed to help patients
with extensive tissue damage...

14:11.457 --> 14:13.958
Burn victims, cancer patients,

14:14.043 --> 14:15.460
amputees.

14:15.544 --> 14:18.329
It copied the genetic data
of the healthy cells

14:18.414 --> 14:21.165
of the patient and used it
to replace the damaged ones.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.084
Malcolm was in charge of it.

14:23.135 --> 14:24.302
And did it work?

14:24.386 --> 14:26.471
No, he never had
a chance to find out.

14:26.555 --> 14:29.674
William shut the project down,
citing ethical concerns.

14:29.758 --> 14:32.510
Ethical concerns?

14:32.595 --> 14:34.312
Yes.

14:34.396 --> 14:36.797
But I only bring it up
because the project was based

14:36.849 --> 14:38.966
on copying human tissue.

14:39.018 --> 14:40.668
Kind of like shapeshifting.

14:40.736 --> 14:42.203
Hmm.

14:44.139 --> 14:47.325
There are people who think
very highly of your work and you.

14:47.409 --> 14:48.576
What people?

14:48.644 --> 14:51.279
You don't know them,
but they know you.

14:51.330 --> 14:52.647
They share your vision.

14:52.698 --> 14:56.868
<i>They will pay you</i>
<i>to continue your research.</i>

15:00.339 --> 15:02.874
You always bring a gun
to a business proposal?

15:02.958 --> 15:05.543
I couldn't take
the chance you'd say no.

15:05.628 --> 15:07.845
<i>- We need your help.</i>
- Help with what?

15:07.930 --> 15:10.214
<i>I don't know what you're hoping</i>
<i>to find in those files.</i>

15:10.299 --> 15:12.833
That work never went anywhere.
It's useless.

15:21.694 --> 15:24.028
I was terminally ill.

15:24.113 --> 15:26.197
Stage four melanoma
when they came to me.

15:26.281 --> 15:29.850
Cellular replication?

15:29.902 --> 15:31.285
<i>They did it?</i>

15:31.353 --> 15:33.287
The cancer went
into complete remission.

15:33.355 --> 15:34.989
It was a miracle...

15:35.040 --> 15:36.908
At least for a while.

15:36.992 --> 15:39.827
But the procedure
didn't fully take.

15:39.878 --> 15:42.080
<i>The cells,</i>
<i>they aren't stable.</i>

15:42.164 --> 15:43.748
<i>My cancer is gone, but...</i>

15:43.832 --> 15:46.050
I'm still dying.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.726
There are no files.

15:56.878 --> 15:59.681
- What?
- It's all up here.

15:59.732 --> 16:02.350
I'll do it, Nadine.

16:02.401 --> 16:04.569
I'll help you.

16:04.653 --> 16:06.988
But just so you know,
I-I don't do my best work

16:07.055 --> 16:09.557
at gunpoint.

16:24.573 --> 16:25.906
Walter said the shapeshifters

16:25.958 --> 16:27.908
that we encountered
at the train yards

16:27.960 --> 16:29.677
weren't able to complete
their shifts,

16:29.745 --> 16:31.179
that they were flawed.

16:31.246 --> 16:33.131
And this has to do
with Dr. Truss how?

16:33.215 --> 16:34.432
Uh, well...

16:34.516 --> 16:39.220
The, uh, cellular replication
project he was working on...

16:39.271 --> 16:41.055
They might require
his expertise.

16:41.106 --> 16:42.974
So you're suggesting
Malcolm Truss was kidnapped

16:43.058 --> 16:44.592
so the shapeshifter
could perfect itself.

16:44.643 --> 16:47.094
If the shapeshifter needs
Malcolm to fix itself,

16:47.146 --> 16:48.613
then they
need equipment--

16:48.697 --> 16:50.314
Medical supplies-- Which
means they're on the move.

16:50.399 --> 16:52.283
Malcolm's car was
missing from his home.

16:52.367 --> 16:55.236
We put the, uh, plates
and car's make out to local PD.

16:55.287 --> 16:57.955
Well, if the
shapeshifter's flawed,

16:58.040 --> 16:59.457
then it might have
something to do

16:59.541 --> 17:00.941
with the tech Dr. Bishop
pulled from inside

17:00.993 --> 17:02.460
the two we killed
at the train yard.

17:02.544 --> 17:03.828
Maybe that's
what's malfunctioning.

17:03.912 --> 17:05.128
I checked with tech services.

17:05.214 --> 17:06.781
<i>They don't even know</i>
<i>what the device is,</i>

17:06.832 --> 17:07.915
<i>the purpose it serves--</i>

17:07.965 --> 17:09.300
They're memory disks.

17:09.384 --> 17:11.117
<i>I've seen them before.</i>

17:13.722 --> 17:16.140
Those devices
you're talking about,

17:16.224 --> 17:17.308
they're memory disks.

17:20.145 --> 17:22.262
What do you know
about shapeshifters?

17:22.314 --> 17:23.564
Quite a lot, actually.

17:23.632 --> 17:24.766
Enlighten me.

17:24.817 --> 17:26.818
Well, I know if you
shoot them in the head,

17:26.902 --> 17:28.486
- they bleed Mercury.
<i>- Those are the old ones.</i>

17:28.569 --> 17:30.938
<i>What about the new ones--</i>
<i>The human shapeshifters?</i>

17:30.989 --> 17:32.023
The what?

17:32.107 --> 17:34.408
They're prototypes,
human hybrids.

17:34.476 --> 17:37.195
Tell us about the memory disks.

17:37.279 --> 17:39.280
Look, they're a lot more
than that, actually.

17:39.331 --> 17:41.449
<i>The disks are divided up into</i>
<i>three different partitions--</i>

17:41.500 --> 17:43.201
Cognitive functions,
biochemical functions,

17:43.285 --> 17:44.786
and mission objective.

17:44.837 --> 17:46.420
And you know all this how?

17:46.488 --> 17:48.706
Because I've decrypted
a couple of them myself.

17:48.791 --> 17:50.591
If you've decrypted
their tech before,

17:50.659 --> 17:51.992
you think
you could do it again?

17:52.044 --> 17:53.544
I'll ask the questions,
Agent Lee.

17:53.629 --> 17:55.996
We've been sitting
on this tech for weeks.

17:56.048 --> 17:57.131
Our people
aren't able to crack it.

17:57.182 --> 17:58.216
What's the harm
in letting him try?

17:58.300 --> 17:59.550
You about done?

17:59.635 --> 18:00.685
<i>Lincoln has a point.</i>

18:00.769 --> 18:03.688
What is the harm
in letting me try?

18:03.772 --> 18:05.056
What is it that you're after?

18:05.140 --> 18:06.474
<i>You're obviously</i> <i>not doing this</i>

18:06.525 --> 18:07.842
out of the goodness
of your heart,

18:07.893 --> 18:09.193
so what is it that you want?

18:09.278 --> 18:11.028
I just want to talk
to Walter again.

18:11.113 --> 18:12.780
Well, we tried that already.

18:12.848 --> 18:14.849
In case you didn't notice,
it didn't go so well.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.984
<i>I don't see the point</i>
<i>in letting you upset him again.</i>

18:17.035 --> 18:20.238
I'm sorry about that.

18:20.322 --> 18:22.073
I was talking to him like
he was the man that I knew,

18:22.157 --> 18:23.207
which clearly he is not.

18:23.292 --> 18:25.326
He's different,
just like you are.

18:25.377 --> 18:27.194
<i>But I need his help.</i>

18:27.246 --> 18:29.564
<i>And you need mine.</i>

18:31.583 --> 18:33.367
Anyone have a better idea?

18:37.472 --> 18:41.275
I'll see what I can do.

19:37.449 --> 19:40.451
I hope you have money.

19:44.239 --> 19:46.908
You're bleeding.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.410
You should wash up.
I'll take care of this.

19:52.798 --> 19:54.999
I told you
I would help you, Nadine.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.251
I meant it.

20:01.139 --> 20:02.506
She's adorable.

20:02.591 --> 20:05.176
Is that your little girl?

20:05.260 --> 20:07.178
Yes...

20:07.262 --> 20:09.263
My daughter, Hayley.

20:09.314 --> 20:10.681
That's a pretty name.

20:10.766 --> 20:13.634
Karen, my wife...

20:13.685 --> 20:14.652
She always wanted kids.

20:14.736 --> 20:17.738
I was too busy with work.

20:17.806 --> 20:20.858
And when that ended,
I guess I was just too angry

20:20.943 --> 20:22.526
to think about what she wanted.

20:22.611 --> 20:24.195
Still...

20:24.279 --> 20:27.748
I guess I'm hoping that one day

20:27.816 --> 20:31.151
she'll let me be a part
of her life again.

20:55.861 --> 20:57.895
<i>Dispatch,</i>
<i>this is Sierra 2-4.</i>

20:57.980 --> 20:59.313
I think I've got a visual

20:59.364 --> 21:01.532
on that stolen plate they put
the bolo out on, over.

21:01.616 --> 21:02.850
<i>Go ahead, Sierra 2-4.</i>

21:02.901 --> 21:06.737
<i>Plate reads Five, Lima, Tango,</i>
<i>three, one, six.</i>

21:06.822 --> 21:08.689
- Over.
<i>- Yeah, that's the plate.</i>

21:08.740 --> 21:10.190
<i>Be advised, Sierra 2-4,</i>

21:10.242 --> 21:11.742
<i>the suspect is armed</i>
<i>and dangerous.</i>

21:11.827 --> 21:13.828
<i>Stand down</i>
<i>and wait for backup, over.</i>

21:13.879 --> 21:15.362
Roger that--
Waiting for backup.

21:15.414 --> 21:17.048
Sierra 2-4 out.

21:26.925 --> 21:29.343
And, uh, $20 on pump 2.

21:39.438 --> 21:40.821
Ready?

21:40.889 --> 21:42.222
Yep.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.986
<i>Okay, our mystery man</i>
<i>is all set up</i>

22:00.053 --> 22:02.738
<i>with the device we got</i>
<i>off the shapeshifter.</i>

22:02.823 --> 22:04.357
And I requisitioned all
of the equipment he asked for.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.825
And do you think
that he's confident

22:05.892 --> 22:07.393
he can do something with it?

22:07.444 --> 22:10.529
He seems pretty confident,
in general.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.899
Olivia...

22:13.951 --> 22:15.618
I may have only met you
a few weeks ago,

22:15.702 --> 22:17.036
but I think I know you
well enough to know

22:17.087 --> 22:18.788
that this guy's gotten to you.

22:18.872 --> 22:20.339
You didn't ask me
to take him that tech

22:20.407 --> 22:22.574
because you had
a dentist appointment.

22:24.928 --> 22:28.514
He was in my dreams,
and now he's here.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.915
I-I-I can...

22:29.967 --> 22:32.751
Maybe understand why he
would be in Walter's head,

22:32.803 --> 22:34.603
if he's some iteration
of his son, but...

22:34.688 --> 22:35.921
Why mine?

22:35.973 --> 22:37.106
<i>Okay, we got a hit</i>

22:37.190 --> 22:38.574
on Malcolm Truss'
plates--

22:38.642 --> 22:40.276
Two hours from here,
Rutland, Vermont.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.778
Truss comes in
at 11:53 A.M.,

22:42.863 --> 22:45.898
pays for his gas
in cash, alone.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.533
<i>Not exactly the behavior</i>

22:47.600 --> 22:49.235
<i>of someone being held</i>
<i>against their will.</i>

22:49.286 --> 22:51.270
Seems more like an accomplice.

22:51.321 --> 22:54.457
Unless he doesn't know
he's with a shapeshifter.

22:59.279 --> 23:01.297
The people I
work for built this lab

23:01.381 --> 23:03.632
according to the specifications
in your file.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.301
Automated tissue microarrayer,

23:05.385 --> 23:08.137
blood gas analyzer,
centrifuges.

23:08.221 --> 23:11.140
I think you'll find we've got
everything you'll need.

23:11.224 --> 23:14.793
This is amazing.

23:18.648 --> 23:22.485
The artificial tissue
has adapted...

23:22.569 --> 23:24.770
Remarkably well.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.808
Considering the extent
of the grafting,

23:29.860 --> 23:32.078
it's lucky your body
didn't reject it.

23:32.145 --> 23:33.996
The fact that you're even alive

23:34.081 --> 23:35.998
is nothing short of a miracle.

23:36.083 --> 23:39.335
Then I suppose that would make
you a miracle-worker.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.922
After all, the grafts
were based on your research.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.625
I never thought
I'd say this, but...

23:46.676 --> 23:49.995
I wish William Bell
were alive...

23:50.047 --> 23:51.964
Just so he could see you.

23:52.015 --> 23:55.017
I truly believed that the work
that we were doing

23:55.102 --> 23:58.304
was going to change the world.

23:58.355 --> 24:01.307
And just like that...

24:01.358 --> 24:03.642
<i>Bell shut down</i> <i>the project.</i>

24:03.693 --> 24:06.145
And all he could say was,

24:06.196 --> 24:10.783
"some things are not ours
to tamper with.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.352
"Some things...

24:13.403 --> 24:15.371
Are God's."

24:15.455 --> 24:17.523
One man shouldn't stand

24:17.574 --> 24:20.526
in the way of progress,
not even William Bell.

24:24.881 --> 24:27.500
Well, the good news is

24:27.551 --> 24:30.803
I found the source
of the cellular degeneration.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.089
Uh, your genome
isn't fully propagating

24:33.173 --> 24:35.925
- through the artificial tissues.
- Can you fix it?

24:36.009 --> 24:38.561
I had hoped
this day would come.

24:38.645 --> 24:42.014
Yes, I can.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.773
Hello, Walter.

24:52.225 --> 24:53.659
Nina.

24:53.727 --> 24:55.411
I'm probably the last person
in the world

24:55.495 --> 24:56.996
you want to see right now.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.748
But Olivia said
you weren't doing so well.

25:01.835 --> 25:06.088
This man claiming
to be your son, Walter...

25:06.173 --> 25:09.408
If there was ever a time to try
to get past our differences,

25:09.459 --> 25:12.744
it seemed like now.

25:12.796 --> 25:13.846
I'm fine.

25:13.913 --> 25:17.967
The man is a scientific
anomaly, nothing more.

25:18.051 --> 25:21.854
Walter, you're making
Peter's favorite dessert.

25:21.921 --> 25:26.559
<i>I find that baking</i>
<i>custard calms me.</i>

25:29.529 --> 25:31.647
Seeing this man
has brought up many things

25:31.731 --> 25:33.115
I've tried to forget.

25:37.204 --> 25:40.105
That night at the lake,
you begged me to stop,

25:40.157 --> 25:41.824
but I couldn't.

25:41.908 --> 25:44.627
I couldn't watch
Peter die, not again.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.413
I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.914
- Walter--
- I've hated you.

25:48.965 --> 25:52.384
For 25 years, I hated you.

25:52.452 --> 25:53.919
Had you not been there,

25:53.970 --> 25:55.171
the vial wouldn't
have been broken,

25:55.255 --> 25:57.256
and I would've healed Peter
on the other side.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.391
He wouldn't have fallen
through the ice.

25:59.459 --> 26:03.179
I blamed you
for the death of my son.

26:03.263 --> 26:07.066
I blamed you.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.968
I couldn't live with myself...

26:10.020 --> 26:11.904
Because you were right.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.024
I'd crossed the line.

26:15.108 --> 26:16.942
For the sake of one life,

26:16.993 --> 26:20.162
<i>I destroyed two worlds.</i>

26:20.247 --> 26:22.164
And over the years,
I've come to terms

26:22.249 --> 26:25.651
with the fact that
I deserve to be punished...

26:25.702 --> 26:27.419
- To suffer.
- No.

26:27.487 --> 26:29.171
Walter, you're not
that man anymore.

26:29.256 --> 26:31.490
I've watched you.

26:31.541 --> 26:32.824
Working with
the Fringe Division,

26:32.876 --> 26:34.627
you've done everything
in your power

26:34.678 --> 26:35.994
to heal the damage.

26:36.046 --> 26:38.931
I saw him, Nina...

26:38.998 --> 26:41.634
The man.

26:41.685 --> 26:43.669
I saw my boy

26:43.720 --> 26:46.889
in that man's eyes.

26:46.973 --> 26:50.276
The way he looked
that night in the ice...

26:50.343 --> 26:53.362
Floating away from me.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.614
God help me, I...

26:55.682 --> 27:00.119
Saw the eyes of my boy
in a man's face.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.821
That filled me with...

27:02.872 --> 27:06.024
Indescribable joy.

27:09.579 --> 27:11.664
But I don't deserve joy.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.465
For anyone else,

27:13.533 --> 27:15.834
this would be received
as a miracle--

27:15.885 --> 27:18.137
To get a glimpse
of their dead son.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.172
Why should I be rewarded
for what I've done?

27:20.223 --> 27:23.709
Because maybe
you've suffered enough.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.561
No, I can't explain it, Walter.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.045
I don't know why he's here.

27:27.097 --> 27:29.815
I don't know where
he came from.

27:29.882 --> 27:33.185
But maybe you've just been
given a second chance.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.168
I was told you found something.

27:51.554 --> 27:52.888
It's a DNA sequence.

27:52.956 --> 27:54.673
Meaning what exactly?

27:54.741 --> 27:57.593
Meaning I found
six distinct genetic profiles

27:57.677 --> 28:00.379
on that memory
from the shapeshifter tech.

28:00.447 --> 28:02.114
Apparently these things
are able to switch

28:02.182 --> 28:03.849
between every single identity
they've ever taken,

28:03.917 --> 28:05.184
not just one.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.885
That's gonna make it a lot
more difficult to find them.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.054
No, it's gonna make them
impossible to find.

28:09.105 --> 28:11.140
The new, improved models
do a lot more than

28:11.224 --> 28:13.359
just take on the appearance
of another person.

28:13.426 --> 28:16.261
They replicate their victims
down to the molecular level,

28:16.329 --> 28:17.980
including every
last strand of DNA.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.448
You're saying
these shapeshifters

28:19.532 --> 28:21.450
will be completely
indistinguishable

28:21.534 --> 28:22.985
from whoever
they're impersonating?

28:23.069 --> 28:25.154
They're the perfect
infiltrators.

28:25.221 --> 28:27.623
By transforming their DNA,

28:27.707 --> 28:29.792
they can become anyone.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.410
<i>They perfect</i> <i>this technology,</i>

28:31.461 --> 28:33.879
and they can get close to us.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.415
They could replace
any one of us.

28:36.466 --> 28:40.252
And short of performing surgery
to find those memory disks,

28:40.303 --> 28:44.640
you would have absolutely
no way of knowing.

28:47.811 --> 28:48.761
Okay.

28:48.812 --> 28:51.230
You should lie back.

28:51.297 --> 28:54.149
You may feel a little nauseous.

29:01.024 --> 29:01.973
Nadine?

29:11.668 --> 29:13.619
What the hell?

29:13.670 --> 29:14.986
What is it?

29:15.038 --> 29:18.290
Why do you look like my wife?

29:24.180 --> 29:26.048
You said you were going
to help me, Malcolm,

29:26.132 --> 29:28.517
and you will.

29:40.544 --> 29:42.846
Get me Broyles, now.

29:52.439 --> 29:53.690
Progress?

29:53.757 --> 29:55.608
This thing's broadcasting
some kind of signal.

29:55.693 --> 29:56.776
To who?

29:56.861 --> 29:58.427
That's just the problem.

29:58.479 --> 30:00.230
I can't break
the high-grade encryption

30:00.281 --> 30:02.031
without a significant
increase in CPU cycles.

30:02.099 --> 30:03.399
Meaning?

30:03.450 --> 30:05.201
I need a bigger computer.

30:09.123 --> 30:11.074
Just like old times...

30:11.125 --> 30:12.325
Sort of.

30:18.415 --> 30:20.767
How long is this gonna take?

30:20.834 --> 30:22.635
Not long at all.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.053
Those are coordinates.

30:24.121 --> 30:25.221
To what?

30:25.289 --> 30:28.124
Could you pull me up
a map of the city?

30:28.175 --> 30:31.394
So what do luxury cars and
shapeshifters have in common?

30:31.461 --> 30:34.397
They both have LoJack
systems apparently.

30:34.464 --> 30:36.799
You're saying these things
have-- Have tracking devices?

30:36.850 --> 30:38.234
Yeah, I think whoever's
in charge wants

30:38.302 --> 30:39.468
to keep an eye on his agents.

30:39.520 --> 30:40.820
That's t one that
you guys have here.

30:40.905 --> 30:42.238
The one we just hooked up.

30:42.306 --> 30:44.691
But there are actually two
different sets of coordinates

30:44.775 --> 30:46.743
<i>- being broadcast.</i>
- That's by the port.

30:46.810 --> 30:48.511
I think you just found
our shapeshifter.

30:48.579 --> 30:49.612
For the time being.

30:49.663 --> 30:50.830
But whoever's monitoring
that network,

30:50.915 --> 30:52.148
they're going to know
that I breached it.

30:52.199 --> 30:53.499
They can shut down
our access at any time.

30:53.584 --> 30:55.535
We should move.

30:59.590 --> 31:00.957
How did you do that?

31:01.008 --> 31:03.009
Why did you look like my wife?

31:05.012 --> 31:08.464
My offer was sincere...

31:08.515 --> 31:10.383
To continue your research
with people

31:10.467 --> 31:12.802
who'd provide the resources
to complete your work.

31:12.853 --> 31:13.803
What people?

31:13.854 --> 31:16.139
Why did you look like my wife?

31:16.190 --> 31:17.523
Malcolm, it's not
important right now.

31:17.608 --> 31:18.858
<i>Why did you look</i> <i>like my wife?</i>

31:18.943 --> 31:20.777
Malcolm...

31:26.066 --> 31:29.953
Great progress
requires great sacrifice.

31:30.020 --> 31:33.573
Your work created me.

31:35.075 --> 31:36.876
Malcolm, you need to step back

31:36.961 --> 31:38.878
and see things objectively

31:38.963 --> 31:41.297
as a scientist.

31:41.365 --> 31:45.385
You let go of Karen long ago
for a greater purpose.

31:45.469 --> 31:48.388
Don't let that all be
for nothing.

31:48.472 --> 31:51.474
I'm offering you
something precious...

31:51.541 --> 31:53.376
An opportunity to take back

31:53.427 --> 31:55.728
what William Bell took
from you--

31:55.813 --> 31:58.765
Your legacy.

32:15.249 --> 32:17.700
It may be possible...

32:17.751 --> 32:22.505
To alter the compound...

32:22.572 --> 32:25.741
To accommodate...

32:25.793 --> 32:28.878
Multiple genomes.

32:28.929 --> 32:31.414
How?

32:31.465 --> 32:34.517
We need to induce a state

32:34.584 --> 32:37.136
of permanent
hyper-replication.

32:37.221 --> 32:39.689
Ah!

32:39.756 --> 32:40.723
What are you doing?

32:40.774 --> 32:44.444
I am adding a bonding agent.

32:44.528 --> 32:46.429
I'm familiar enough
with biochemistry

32:46.480 --> 32:49.932
to know that restriction enzymes
would fragment my DNA

32:49.983 --> 32:51.600
and trigger a massive
internal hemorrhage.

32:51.652 --> 32:54.404
Ah!

32:56.273 --> 32:58.875
Finish what you started.

32:58.942 --> 33:01.611
I won't ask again.

33:08.118 --> 33:11.454
Okay, we'll take front.
You go on my signal.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.677
How much longer?

33:17.761 --> 33:21.297
Five minutes for
the centrifugation process.

33:21.348 --> 33:26.102
And then we'll know
if the serum's complete.

33:32.309 --> 33:33.409
<i>Team one in position.</i>

33:33.477 --> 33:34.410
<i>Team two in position.</i>

33:34.478 --> 33:35.644
<i>On your go.</i>

34:07.544 --> 34:08.561
<i>I got her.</i>

34:22.292 --> 34:24.127
Oh, my God.

34:24.194 --> 34:26.462
She's headed to the roof.

34:53.389 --> 34:55.358
Okay.
This is Agent Dunham.

34:55.409 --> 34:56.859
Agent Warrick is down.

34:56.909 --> 34:59.162
We need paramedics
on the roof now.

34:59.229 --> 35:00.613
She jumped.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.812
Mr. Truss?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.814
Agent Olivia Dunham.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.650
Uh, I understand
that it's been a long day.

35:36.718 --> 35:39.103
We're just going to need
to get a statement from you.

35:39.187 --> 35:41.772
And then an agent
will take you home.

35:41.857 --> 35:43.774
What that...

35:43.859 --> 35:46.861
Thing said about Karen...

35:48.363 --> 35:49.780
It's true, isn't it?

35:49.865 --> 35:53.400
She's dead?

35:53.452 --> 35:58.238
H.P.D. found your wife
in her home this morning.

35:58.290 --> 36:01.459
I'm so sorry.

36:01.543 --> 36:03.294
It's my fault.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.382
"Some things are not ours
to tamper with."

36:08.433 --> 36:10.267
Excuse me?

36:12.754 --> 36:17.024
It's something someone
said to me once.

36:17.091 --> 36:20.895
I didn't understand it
at the time.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.114
But I do now.

36:24.199 --> 36:26.116
<i>Dunham!</i>

36:26.201 --> 36:27.568
Excuse me.

36:31.873 --> 36:34.658
The dive team--
They just found a body.

36:34.743 --> 36:38.329
That's not our shapeshifter.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.751
That's Agent Warrick.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.219
Get dispatch on the line.

36:45.286 --> 36:48.756
We need all available units
on that ambulance now.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.315
Agent Dunham, I have
those hourlies you asked for.

37:15.367 --> 37:16.834
Thank you, Jill.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.341
I sent the reports to Broyles,

37:24.426 --> 37:27.044
so all the paperwork is done.

37:27.128 --> 37:30.180
Thanks.

37:30.265 --> 37:31.932
We're gonna find her, Lincoln.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.934
I mean, look at how
much more we know now

37:34.002 --> 37:35.769
than we did this morning.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.671
Yeah.

37:40.976 --> 37:42.643
Do you want to go get
a bite to eat or something?

37:42.694 --> 37:44.061
No.

37:44.145 --> 37:45.696
Uh, thank you.

37:45.780 --> 37:50.451
I, um-- I'm going to head
back to the hotel.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.821
<i>Good night.</i>

37:53.872 --> 37:55.372
Night.

37:55.457 --> 37:58.876
Agent Dunham, I have those
hourlies that you asked for.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.461
Uh...

38:00.528 --> 38:02.046
Didn't we already do this?

38:02.130 --> 38:03.080
I'm sorry?

38:03.164 --> 38:05.716
You already
gave me the fi--

38:07.201 --> 38:09.887
Agent Dunham,
are you all right?

38:09.971 --> 38:11.639
Yeah.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.224
Just a little tired, I think.
Thank you.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.570
Are they feeding you?

38:43.622 --> 38:45.623
Yeah.

38:49.928 --> 38:54.264
Walter, I know
how strange this all is,

38:54.349 --> 38:56.600
how hard it must be for you,

38:56.685 --> 39:00.304
but I don't know what to do.

39:00.388 --> 39:03.774
Nobody remembers me here.

39:03.858 --> 39:06.610
Olivia looks at me
like I'm a stranger,

39:06.695 --> 39:08.862
like she's afraid of me.

39:14.953 --> 39:17.121
I know what you're capable of.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.495
I need your help, Walter,

39:24.579 --> 39:27.581
<i>to fix this.</i>

39:44.065 --> 39:46.650
Every day...

39:46.735 --> 39:50.404
For the past 25 years...

39:50.471 --> 39:54.858
I've tried to imagine what you
would look like as a man...

39:54.943 --> 39:57.578
My son.

40:02.667 --> 40:05.919
But I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

40:05.987 --> 40:08.172
I realize now
this was my punishment.

40:08.256 --> 40:12.126
You were sent to tempt me,

40:12.177 --> 40:14.712
to see if I would repeat
the mistakes of the past.

40:14.796 --> 40:15.796
<i>You shouldn't be here.</i>

40:15.847 --> 40:17.214
Walter, no.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.135
Wherever you came from,

40:21.186 --> 40:23.554
however you got here,
it doesn't matter.

40:23.638 --> 40:24.722
I can't help you.

40:24.806 --> 40:26.356
Walter, you don't understand.

40:26.441 --> 40:28.058
I tried to help a boy,

40:28.143 --> 40:30.444
a version of my son,
