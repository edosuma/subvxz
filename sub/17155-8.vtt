[Stella]
<i>Previously on</i> Jonas LA...

00:02.000 --> 00:04.250
What I'm trying to say is I like you.

00:04.333 --> 00:07.291
This is crazy.
You're a rock star.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.041
-I mean, I'm your--
-Macy.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.750
I'm your Macy.

00:10.834 --> 00:12.000
I want to be friends.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.250
-We are friends.
-Just friends.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.291
-Let's go on a date.
-That sounds really nice.

00:17.375 --> 00:19.000
[camera shutter clicking]

00:20.709 --> 00:22.083
That's perfect.

00:22.917 --> 00:25.125
-You rule.
-Thanks.

00:25.208 --> 00:27.291
-Just stay away from Joe.
-Or what?

00:27.375 --> 00:29.458
Or we're gonna have a problem.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.875
[Mona] So, how's my favorite
movie star today?

00:34.959 --> 00:38.208
-Great. Feeling terrific.
-Wrong answer.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.792
-Hi, Vanessa.
-Hi, baby.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.750
So, how's my favorite movie star today?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.917
Oh, happy to be working
with my favorite young director.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.458
And that's how you take a compliment.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.834
I think I got it now, beautiful.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.166
Everyone, meet my axe-boyfriend.
[laughs]

00:55.542 --> 00:57.709
[both laugh]

00:57.792 --> 01:00.041
Beautiful and hilarious.

01:00.125 --> 01:03.583
So, Joe, how is my
new friend Stella doing?

01:03.667 --> 01:05.291
Have you two been hanging out a lot,

01:05.375 --> 01:09.208
since she lives in your guest house,
which is so close to your house?

01:09.291 --> 01:11.875
Yeah, sure. You know, it's so great

01:11.959 --> 01:13.875
that you're cool
with Stella and I staying friends.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.250
Why wouldn't I be?
I'm a very secure person.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.083
Right, Mona?
Answer, please.

01:18.166 --> 01:20.959
Uh, yes, and now, get your
secure little face to makeup, OK?

01:21.041 --> 01:22.208
Right away.
Bye, Joe.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.834
Bye.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.333
So, listen, um,
I need a new wardrobe girl.

01:27.417 --> 01:30.000
You think your friend, Blondie,
might like the job?

01:30.083 --> 01:32.208
Yeah, I could give her a call
and see if she'd be up for it.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.333
Great.

01:34.959 --> 01:39.000
[exclaims and screams]
Yes, yes, yes, yes! Absolutely, yes!

01:40.083 --> 01:41.458
I think she may be interested.

on a big Hollywood movie.

02:40.875 --> 02:44.083
Give me a second.
I know this one. You are.

02:44.667 --> 02:48.000
So, you and Nick, a big day tomorrow.

02:48.083 --> 02:50.709
I know, our one-month-iversary.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.291
Oh, I'm sure he's gonna
get you something really special.

[Kevin] <i>The first gift you give</i>
<i>a woman is the most important.</i>

02:58.041 --> 02:59.375
<i>It sets the whole tone</i>
<i>for the relationship.</i>

02:59.458 --> 03:00.917
I'm listening.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.250
For example, the first gift
that I ever gave Mom.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.667
You mean that stupid handprint
you made in kindergarten?

03:05.750 --> 03:08.000
It was third grade.
And she still loves it.

03:08.083 --> 03:09.959
Ever since she's loved me best.

03:10.041 --> 03:12.917
She says she loves me best
every time I take out the trash.

03:13.375 --> 03:15.041
It's her go-to compliment.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.333
Really?

03:17.250 --> 03:19.875
Well, right now, we're focused on
what we're gonna get your girlfriend.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.583
Maybe I'll just ask her
what she wants.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.000
No, no, no, don't do that.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.458
That just says,
"I don't know who you are."

03:26.083 --> 03:28.709
You have to read her mind
or send in a spy.

03:28.792 --> 03:32.250
-I can't read minds.
-Then I spy.

03:32.333 --> 03:34.917
Double Bro Seven, at your service.

03:36.792 --> 03:37.959
[sighs]

03:39.125 --> 03:41.375
So, how's that harness feeling, huh?

03:41.458 --> 03:43.417
-A little big snug.
-Well, get used to it.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.041
I want you to look completely natural
for your big fight scene.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.542
-It's gonna be so cool.
-Yeah.

03:47.625 --> 03:50.458
Dade versus an army of evil ghosts.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.750
-Loving it.
-You know, I saw a ghost once.

03:52.834 --> 03:55.834
Of course, it might have been
an alien disguised as a ghost.

03:55.917 --> 03:58.417
-Uh-huh.
-They do that.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.500
Is he OK?

04:00.583 --> 04:03.125
Best in the biz, right?
So, here's how it's gonna go.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.208
When you get ghost-punched,
Larry is gonna yank you up into the air.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.083
-Right, Lar?
-You bet.

04:08.166 --> 04:11.583
You know, I got a pet chicken.
Her name is Frank.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.333
-Are you sure he's OK?
-I trust him with your life.

04:18.417 --> 04:20.125
All right, Larry, pull him up.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.542
Whoa.
Yeah.

04:23.625 --> 04:26.750
I just want you to know
that you're the first, um, ghost,

04:26.834 --> 04:29.083
I've ever dressed on a movie set.

04:29.166 --> 04:32.542
Actually, you're the first
anything I've ever dressed on a movie set,

04:32.625 --> 04:35.375
so you have to look perfect.

04:37.834 --> 04:40.041
Awesome.
There you go.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.375
Go be scary.
Boo.

04:43.333 --> 04:44.208
You!

04:44.834 --> 04:46.500
Who let you on my set?

04:46.583 --> 04:48.959
It's Mona's set.
And she hired me.

04:49.583 --> 04:54.625
-Does Joe know about this?
-Why don't you ask him yourself?

04:55.959 --> 04:58.291
My two favorite girls on the same set.

04:58.375 --> 05:00.500
-How good is this?
-So good.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.458
-The best.
-The bestest.

05:02.542 --> 05:06.166
The besterest times infinity,
can't be stopped. [laughs]

05:07.208 --> 05:11.083
Honey, you didn't tell me
Stell was working on our movie.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.417
Surprise.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.083
Well, you two... love this.

05:15.625 --> 05:21.208
But I gotta go do an internet search.
"Larry, safety, accidents."

05:22.834 --> 05:24.959
Do you know how hard it is
to pretend we're friends?

05:25.041 --> 05:28.542
Wait, why are we pretending we're friends?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.917
Because I don't want Joe to think
that I'm jealous of you.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
-Hmm.
-Which I'm not.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.375
I don't believe you, but go on.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.500
And you don't want Joe to find out
that you don't like me

05:37.583 --> 05:39.583
because you're afraid
that he won't like you.

05:41.917 --> 05:46.000
It's not fair.
This set was my one Stella-free zone.

05:46.083 --> 05:49.166
Vanessa, I'm not here
to steal your boyfriend.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.083
I'm here to do a job.

05:51.166 --> 05:56.166
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have some ghosts to fabulize.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.166
Good to go! Next!

06:01.166 --> 06:02.417
[Kevin]
Looking good in here.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.667
Kevin, I'm telling you
there was no leak.

06:05.750 --> 06:09.250
Uh, it's preventative plumbing.
It's the latest thing.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.875
Yeah, all fixed.

06:11.959 --> 06:13.709
So, I love what you girls
have done with the place.

06:13.792 --> 06:17.000
Oh, well, we haven't really
done anything with it. [chuckles]

06:17.083 --> 06:19.000
Exactly. So you need things.

06:19.083 --> 06:24.166
So, what would be the perfect
guest-housewarming gift, theoretically?

06:24.250 --> 06:27.500
Um, I don't know.
A can opener?

06:27.583 --> 06:31.125
-More personal.
-A can opener with my name on it?

06:31.208 --> 06:33.917
Say it's Christmas. What would Macy
want to find underneath the tree?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Oh, actually we have
this tradition in my family

06:37.083 --> 06:38.583
where we don't buy each other gifts.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.583
Really?
Keep talking.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.834
We only exchange things
that we've made ourselves,

06:42.917 --> 06:45.542
like for instance this quilt
that my Grammy Grace made for me.

06:45.625 --> 06:46.542
I really love it.

06:46.625 --> 06:52.542
So, what you're saying is no buying,
just making, followed by loving?

06:53.959 --> 06:56.583
-Have you eaten today?
-Yes, I have.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.750
Thank you very much.
Mission accomplished.

07:01.291 --> 07:02.834
[Stella]
Hey, everybody.

07:02.917 --> 07:08.041
I'm home from work
on a major motion picture.

07:08.125 --> 07:10.250
How exciting.
How was your first day?

07:10.333 --> 07:11.583
Amazing.

07:11.667 --> 07:13.208
-Yeah? Tell me all about it.
-Mm-hm.

07:13.291 --> 07:16.542
Mace, I was so in the zone, like,
I just knew how everyone should look.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.417
And... and Mona loved it.
And I was in heaven.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
Yay!
And Miss Vanessa?

07:22.583 --> 07:26.500
Oh, let's just say
Stella Malone threw down.

07:26.583 --> 07:27.792
-[Macy exclaims]
-Yeah.

07:27.875 --> 07:28.959
Play by play.

07:29.041 --> 07:32.542
OK, so she was all like,
"This is my only Stella-free zone."

07:32.625 --> 07:34.625
And I was like,
"I'm here to do a job."

07:34.709 --> 07:36.291
And then she walked off,
and I ripped some guy's shirt.

07:36.375 --> 07:38.834
-And it was awesome.
-I'm so proud of you.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.417
She will not be a problem
for me anymore.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.709
[Macy squeals]

07:42.792 --> 07:43.917
-[Joe] Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.709
-Hi.
-Do I have a surprise for you.

07:46.792 --> 07:49.458
Vanessa's house is being fumigated,
flying termites.

07:49.542 --> 07:52.667
And guess who's staying with us
for the whole weekend.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.333
<i>Ciao,</i> roomies.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.750
[Joe]
This is gonna be so awesome.

08:06.875 --> 08:09.458
[Vanessa snoring]

08:15.959 --> 08:19.250
You said Vanessa wasn't going to be
a problem for you anymore.

08:19.333 --> 08:23.250
She's not.
She is a problem for us.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.834
-[door opens]
-What's that racket?

08:25.917 --> 08:27.917
-Is someone mowing the lawn in here?
-[snoring continues]

08:28.792 --> 08:29.709
Who's that?

08:29.792 --> 08:32.500
Joe's girlfriend.
Yeah, she has flying termites.

08:32.583 --> 08:35.834
Well, at least I don't have to
worry about you dating him.

08:36.875 --> 08:37.959
[door closes]

08:38.041 --> 08:40.125
[Vanessa inhales]

08:41.000 --> 08:43.500
Good morning, roomies.

08:43.583 --> 08:45.542
[scoffs]
I call bathroom.

08:52.750 --> 08:54.917
So, how did you sleep?

08:55.000 --> 08:58.208
-Horrible.
-Bummer. I slept like a baby.

08:58.291 --> 09:00.458
Well, you snore like a water buffalo.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.208
Oh, I had a lot of cheese last night.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.667
It makes me a little phlegmy.
[coughs]

09:04.750 --> 09:06.667
OK, OK, I get it.
I get it.

09:06.750 --> 09:09.709
I went to where you work,
and you came to where I live.

09:09.792 --> 09:12.792
And we're even.
So, why don't you just pack up your stuff

09:12.875 --> 09:14.000
and just get out of here?

09:14.083 --> 09:17.041
-I don't think so.
-You can't stay all summer.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.458
Oh, I don't know,
because after they fumigate,

09:20.542 --> 09:24.458
things might be a little termitey
and I'll have to redecorate,

09:24.542 --> 09:28.208
which could take...
carry the six, divide by four...

09:28.291 --> 09:30.125
All summer.

09:30.208 --> 09:36.208
Oh, excuse me while I just clear
a little space for my... products.

09:37.166 --> 09:41.166
OK, what is it gonna take
to just get you to go away?

09:41.250 --> 09:43.333
Quit your job on <i>Forever April.</i>

09:43.417 --> 09:45.458
Not gonna happen.

09:45.542 --> 09:49.375
How would you girls
feel about triple bunk beds?

09:50.542 --> 09:52.208
[clicks tongue]

10:00.458 --> 10:02.583
-Are you sure Macy wants a mug?
-Can you make a quilt?

10:02.667 --> 10:04.417
-No.
-Then this is your best shot.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.625
I'm telling you, man,
Macy only likes handmade gifts.

10:06.709 --> 10:09.583
-It's her family's tradition.
-Yeah, but it's just little kids in here.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.667
So what?
When has that ever stopped us

10:11.750 --> 10:13.500
from jumping in the ball pit
at Burger Monkey?

10:14.542 --> 10:16.291
-Good point.
-Thank you.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.417
[grunting]

10:18.917 --> 10:20.834
-Hi.
-Hey, Stells.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.291
I was just working on my fight moves
for the next scene.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.208
So, you guys have
a fun slumber party last night?

10:26.291 --> 10:28.375
Uh, no.

10:29.291 --> 10:32.667
Joe, um, there's something
that you should know--

10:32.750 --> 10:37.583
Joe. And roomie.
I was looking all over for you two.

10:37.667 --> 10:39.208
So sneaky.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.000
-Good morning, Vanessa.
-Hi. Are you nervous

10:41.083 --> 10:43.792
-for your big day, Joe?
-Just a little bit.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.000
Do you know Larry the rigging guy?

10:46.083 --> 10:48.542
Yeah. You have so much
on your plate today.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.375
We wouldn't want anything to upset you.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.041
Right, Stell?

10:53.166 --> 10:55.792
Right, Vaness.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.333
You guys are awesome.
Stella, you wanted to tell me something.

11:00.417 --> 11:01.542
Yeah.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.583
Good luck today.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.750
All right, I think it's finally starting
to take on some mug-like qualities.

11:12.834 --> 11:15.959
-Yeah, keep telling yourself that.
-That mug is ug.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.583
Kiara, what are you doing here?

11:17.667 --> 11:19.208
It's my cousin Theresa's
birthday party.

11:19.291 --> 11:22.333
She's ten.
What's your excuse?

11:22.417 --> 11:24.625
We're making a very important gift
for a very special lady.

11:24.709 --> 11:27.959
Oh, my bad for teasing you.
Your mom is gonna love it.

11:28.041 --> 11:29.709
-Thank you.
-Actually, it's for Macy.

11:29.792 --> 11:31.834
Hold up.
You're making a mug for your love dove?

11:31.917 --> 11:34.583
Yes, Kiara, I'm making a mug
for my love dove.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.917
[laughs] That is so sad.
It's hilarious.

11:38.000 --> 11:41.667
-What do you mean?
-Please, no girl wants a corny old mug.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.542
You might as well just break it now
and save her the trouble.

11:43.625 --> 11:47.041
-You still think this is a good idea?
-Absolutely. I'm giving mine to Mom.

11:47.125 --> 11:49.000
She's gonna put it
right next to that handprint.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.375
-What?
-Sorry, my hand slipped.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.333
Oh, yeah. Mine, too.

11:56.417 --> 11:58.166
-I think you made it better.
-[Kiara chuckles]

11:58.250 --> 12:00.583
[Mona]
And cut!

12:00.667 --> 12:03.542
Beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.125
Is this my chai ice tea?

12:05.208 --> 12:06.208
Ow!

12:07.166 --> 12:10.041
-Oh, please, I didn't even touch you.
-You were thinking about it.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.625
I could feel you
pricking me with your mind.

12:13.208 --> 12:16.333
Hey, Vanessa, when we break for lunch,
why don't you meet me in the barn?

12:16.417 --> 12:17.375
I want to show you something pretty cool.

12:17.458 --> 12:22.208
Goody! I love cool things
from Joe to me.

12:23.041 --> 12:24.709
Hey, Stells, I didn't see you there.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.750
-Hi.
-[Joe] Why don't you come along, too?

12:26.834 --> 12:29.166
-Oh, she's so busy.
-I can make the time.

12:29.250 --> 12:31.250
Great, then I'll see you
ladies in the barn.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.166
All done.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.083
Ow!

12:37.417 --> 12:39.917
-Mona, she stuck me.
-No, I didn't. I didn't.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.417
Ladies, what's this all about?

12:41.500 --> 12:43.750
-Well, I think it all really started--
-Don't care.

12:43.834 --> 12:45.333
These girls are driving me crazy.
Do me a favor,

12:45.417 --> 12:47.625
can you book me a massage for,
like, 10:00 tonight?

12:50.166 --> 12:53.834
-Dude, she's gonna hate it.
-No, she won't, because it's from you.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.583
[groans]
That is nasty.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.917
Don't you have anything positive to say?

12:59.000 --> 13:00.667
Oh, I'm positive.
That is nasty.

13:00.750 --> 13:02.083
Yeah, like your mug's any better.

13:02.834 --> 13:05.000
My mug will beg to differ.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.583
All right, kid,
how much you want for it?

13:06.667 --> 13:09.375
[scoffs] Save your money
and buy your girlfriend a real present.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.542
-Yeah, let's just go to the mall.
-No, dude.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.000
The whole point was to give Macy
something that you made yourself.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.917
You're right. But, you know,

13:16.000 --> 13:17.709
it wouldn't be too hard
to change "Mom" to "Macy."

13:17.792 --> 13:20.625
No way.
Mom's gonna love this.

13:20.709 --> 13:22.875
This is what's putting me back on top.

13:22.959 --> 13:26.417
Hey, would you guys mind saying hi
to my cousin Theresa and her friends?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.083
It would really make
her birthday special.

13:28.166 --> 13:30.667
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Sure, we always have time for our fans.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.667
Yo, everybody, get over here.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.625
-Hey, guys. How are you doing?
-Hey, everybody. Happy birthday.

13:34.709 --> 13:36.625
Yo, check out that whack mug.

13:36.709 --> 13:37.792
[all laughing]

13:40.208 --> 13:42.917
Oh, man, it's a good thing
you guys can sing.

13:49.333 --> 13:53.625
-Hey, Larry, mind doing me a favor?
-Yes, you can borrow my pants.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.375
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't need pants. Good on pants.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.667
Your loss.
These babies are really broken in.

13:59.750 --> 14:01.667
I appreciate the offer.

14:02.625 --> 14:05.333
Are you OK?
You need to talk?

14:05.417 --> 14:09.583
You know what makes me feel better?
Yelling at rocks.

14:09.667 --> 14:14.250
-Larry, focus.
-I can't. My eyes don't work together.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.875
Oh, sorry.

14:16.959 --> 14:20.083
Listen, my girlfriend and my friend
will be here in a few minutes.

14:20.166 --> 14:23.166
I want you to hoist me up to the top
and leave me there until they get here.

14:23.250 --> 14:27.375
Right, and then you're gonna swoop down
and surprise them like a superhero.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.041
-Exactly.
-You want to borrow my tights?

14:29.125 --> 14:31.125
No, no, no, maybe next time.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.041
Let's hook you up.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.166
-To our month-iversary.
-To our month-iversary.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.375
You know I made up that word, right?

14:40.458 --> 14:42.625
-What other girl does that?
-Aww.

14:42.959 --> 14:44.875
OK, open mine, first.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.458
Wow, it's beautiful.

14:54.458 --> 14:57.750
-You made this?
-Of course not.

14:57.834 --> 15:02.250
-It's a watch. [chuckles]
-So, you bought it with money?

15:02.333 --> 15:04.750
Mm-hmm, I've been saving up
for a special occasion.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.333
OK, my turn.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.250
-Wait, no.
-What?

15:08.625 --> 15:10.250
[sighs]

15:11.500 --> 15:14.125
Oh. Gee...

15:14.208 --> 15:16.000
-It's a...
-Mug.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.458
Where did you get it?

15:19.917 --> 15:22.333
-I made it.
-Why?

15:24.500 --> 15:26.959
Because Kevin said your family
only gives handmade gifts.

15:27.041 --> 15:30.667
Oh, Kevin.
That explains that.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.083
You hate it.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.333
No, no, no, Nick.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.291
I think it's really sweet

15:35.375 --> 15:37.500
that you tried to do
something special for me.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.625
How could I not love it?
Come here.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.500
Thank you.

15:43.375 --> 15:47.125
Well, in case you hadn't noticed,
Kevin is wrong sometimes.

15:47.208 --> 15:50.417
I have noticed that, yes.
So, I had a backup plan.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.750
Better, right?

15:59.834 --> 16:05.083
I know I'm supposed to say no,
but they're kind of awesome.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.166
Thank you.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.792
All right, Larry,
this is gonna be awesome.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.458
Wait, here they come.
All right, lift me up.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.750
You are a wonderful
and giving human being.

16:21.875 --> 16:24.709
-Not my mood, my body.
-Oh, can do.

16:25.625 --> 16:27.000
Oh, my goodness.

16:36.291 --> 16:39.709
-What are you doing here?
-Joe invited the both of us.

16:39.792 --> 16:41.750
Oh, he was just being polite.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.709
Joe and I are friends.
When are you just going to accept that?

16:45.792 --> 16:49.834
-When you quit this movie.
-I'm not going anywhere.

16:49.959 --> 16:54.458
Fine. Then I'll just go to Mona
and get you fired.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.041
Please tell me
that you wouldn't do that.

16:57.125 --> 17:00.834
Mm, last time I checked,
I'm the star of this movie

17:00.959 --> 17:04.208
and you are the assistant
to the assistant ghost dresser.

17:06.542 --> 17:08.792
You know what?
That's it.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.375
I have too much self-respect for this.

17:13.417 --> 17:16.709
So you win.
I quit.

17:17.667 --> 17:18.917
No, she doesn't.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.041
Larry, bring me down.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.166
We're all adrift in a cold
and indifferent universe.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.750
Me... down.

17:27.542 --> 17:28.417
Thank you.

17:29.709 --> 17:32.250
-All the way.
-Uh, sorry, it's stuck.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.959
What's going on with you two?

17:35.000 --> 17:38.917
Joe, you might as well know
that Stella and I aren't really friends.

17:39.041 --> 17:42.458
I kind of figured that out.
But why would you try to get her fired?

17:42.542 --> 17:47.583
I know it was wrong.
The truth is, I was jealous.

17:47.667 --> 17:53.250
It's just... there's something between
you and Stella that we don't have.

17:55.750 --> 17:59.041
Vanessa, I'm sorry,
but I can't go out with you anymore.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.417
I don't blame you, Joe.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.125
And it's always a bad idea
to date your co-stars.

18:05.208 --> 18:07.208
I do it in every movie,
and it never works out.

18:07.291 --> 18:08.625
Every movie?

18:11.041 --> 18:16.166
Joe, we will still be friends.
And we will still work together.

18:16.250 --> 18:20.250
And, if my life coach, spiritual advisor
and accountant are right,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.125
this movie will be a big hit.

18:23.875 --> 18:27.166
Stella, I'm so sorry.

18:34.500 --> 18:40.250
I hope you two can figure out...
whatever it is you need to figure out.

18:45.625 --> 18:50.625
-So... that just happened.
-Yeah.

18:53.291 --> 18:56.500
Do we have anything we need to,
like, figure out?

18:56.583 --> 18:59.125
No, I don't think so.
I think we're good, right?

18:59.208 --> 19:00.375
Totally.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.709
Larry!

19:02.834 --> 19:04.834
-That's lunch.
-[Joe] What?

19:04.917 --> 19:06.834
-Mama packed sardines.
-No, Larry, Larry.

19:06.917 --> 19:09.208
-[Stella] Wait, don't go.
-At least bring me something back.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.083
Thanks, guys.
Great work.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.041
I'm really close to Mona.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.083
Let's get you some more lines
in this movie.

19:20.166 --> 19:21.625
Awesome.

19:23.917 --> 19:27.166
You know, Joe, there's a reason
they call this showbiz.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.458
Everything's for show, even relationships.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.542
I think you're right.

19:32.625 --> 19:37.625
My advice to you is when you
find something real, never let it go.

19:38.041 --> 19:40.750
There's a lot of Vanessa's out there,
but not a whole lot of real.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.000
Thanks, Mona.

19:42.959 --> 19:44.834
I'm kind of choking myself up here.

19:44.917 --> 19:48.041
You tell anybody you saw me like this,
you'll never work in this town again.

-Good morning, boys.
-Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Frankie.

22:02.041 --> 22:04.709
-Hey, Macy.
-What are you all dressed up for?

22:04.792 --> 22:06.959
-You.
-Oh.

22:07.041 --> 22:09.542
Wow. OK.

22:09.625 --> 22:11.709
It's time to get back to the music,
all right? Ideas?

22:11.792 --> 22:13.959
-We should do a new music video.
-I like it.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.542
I was thinking maybe I would direct it.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.041
Wow, that's awesome.
I think you should definitely go for it.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.625
It's just that our dad
usually makes these decisions.

22:19.709 --> 22:21.667
Well, I'm sure he'll support you.

22:21.750 --> 22:26.542
I have hired a director for your video,
and not just any director.
