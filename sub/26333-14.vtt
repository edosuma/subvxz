00:01.080 --> 00:04.380
Gary: After a tragedy,
you grieve.

00:04.380 --> 00:05.540
That's what you do.

00:05.540 --> 00:06.620
It doesn't make
any sense.

00:06.620 --> 00:08.500
Nothing about suicide
makes sense.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.040
And then...
I don't know
what you're doing later, but --

00:10.040 --> 00:12.040
I, um...
Sorry. I didn't realize

00:12.040 --> 00:13.250
you were already
part of a duo.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.380
...life goes on.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.580
You're not giving up
on the restaurant.

00:15.580 --> 00:16.540
That is your dream.

00:16.540 --> 00:17.460
How are we gonna pay for it?

00:17.460 --> 00:20.210
At least, you hope it does.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.830
We're not
out of the woods yet.

00:21.830 --> 00:24.000
We need to continue the chemo
so that surgery is an option.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.580
But to truly heal...

00:25.580 --> 00:27.880
I think we should
get a divorce.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.790
...we need answers, Jon.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.120
You know somebody
named Barbara Morgan?

00:31.120 --> 00:33.460
Jon made her
the fourth beneficiary.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.620
We need the truth...

00:34.620 --> 00:36.120
Who lives here?
No idea.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.460
...and I'm determined...

00:37.460 --> 00:38.790
Oh, my God.

00:38.790 --> 00:40.170
It's the view
from the painting.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.040
...to find it.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.040
B. Morgan.

00:42.040 --> 00:43.500
Barbara Morgan.

01:06.420 --> 01:08.920
Hey.
Can I help you?

01:08.920 --> 01:10.120
Yeah, I sure hope so.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.080
I'm looking for
Barbara Morgan.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.500
Uh, 237 Wickenden Street,
Number 5.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.210
That's the address
I have for her.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.460
Well, you're in
the right place,

01:17.460 --> 01:19.830
but I'm sorry, there's
no one here by that name.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.670
Yeah, I see
the buzzer says "Nelson."

01:21.670 --> 01:24.210
I just really need
to find this woman.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.290
Were you a friend
of...Jon's?

01:28.210 --> 01:29.830
How do you know Jon?

01:29.830 --> 01:34.290
I don't, but a woman came
by here, spoke to my husband.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.040
Right.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.290
Uh...
was her name Ashley?

01:37.290 --> 01:38.620
I think so.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.250
She said that, um...

01:41.250 --> 01:43.750
Do you have any idea
why he killed himself?

01:45.080 --> 01:46.540
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

01:46.540 --> 01:47.830
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.
Sorry.

01:47.830 --> 01:49.500
It's okay.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.380
We don't.

01:51.380 --> 01:54.000
I was hoping Barbara Morgan
might have some answers.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.250
Well, my husband and I
have been living here

01:57.250 --> 01:59.000
a couple years now.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.500
Maybe she lived here
before us.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.290
Man:
Honey, is everything okay?

02:02.290 --> 02:04.000
Yeah, it's fine.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.460
Um, I-I really hope you find
what you're looking for.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.710
Yeah, me too.

02:09.710 --> 02:10.960
Have a good day.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.380
You too.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.080
What did he want?

02:17.080 --> 02:19.080
It's fine, Mitch.
He's gone.

02:24.380 --> 02:26.250
Gary: The Red Ferns,
ladies and gents.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.790
And there's the grizzled
front man, Eddie Saville.

02:28.790 --> 02:32.000
Oh-ho! Wel--
Welcome home, honey!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.880
Uh, role-play stops
right there.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.830
All right, all your texts
were either about Theo

02:35.830 --> 02:37.000
or exaggerated
crowd sizes.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.540
And we get it.
You know?

02:38.540 --> 02:40.830
You didn't want to leave a
paper trail, but now's the time.

02:40.830 --> 02:41.880
Tell us about
the women.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.210
I want to hear about
every sexual encounter

02:43.210 --> 02:44.420
you had
on or off that bus.

02:44.420 --> 02:45.880
Sorry to disappoint
you guys.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.170
Come on!
You did have sex?

02:47.170 --> 02:49.170
Come on.
You dabbled, though, right?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.250
Y-You dibbled, though?

02:50.250 --> 02:52.290
Okay, guys, that's enough!

02:52.290 --> 02:53.670
What's been
going on here?

02:53.670 --> 02:55.920
I switched to dish,
only to switch back to cable.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.620
And, uh,
how's Maggie doing?

02:57.620 --> 03:01.330
Ah. She's bald, but she has
cool, sexy, colored wigs.

03:01.330 --> 03:03.120
She's one round
of chemo away

03:03.120 --> 03:05.540
from getting the surgery,
so...pretty good.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.290
That's fantastic.
And get this.

03:07.290 --> 03:08.880
This guy hired
a private investigator.

03:08.880 --> 03:10.710
I did not hire her.
She works at my office.

03:10.710 --> 03:12.290
He's like a dog
with a bone.

03:12.290 --> 03:13.420
No, he's like a dog
without a bone

03:13.420 --> 03:15.000
still trying
to find his bone.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.460
I would simply like
to understand

03:16.460 --> 03:19.290
why Jon left one-quarter
of his life-insurance policy

03:19.290 --> 03:20.500
to someone
that we don't know.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.790
What if we never know?

03:21.790 --> 03:23.210
Oh, I'm gonna
figure it out.

03:23.210 --> 03:25.000
Just like I'm gonna figure out
how you managed to go on

03:25.000 --> 03:26.170
a sexless
rock 'n' roll tour.

03:26.170 --> 03:27.500
Okay.
No, what is that?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.670
How you doing, man?
I'm chill, you know?

03:29.670 --> 03:32.250
My wife is opening
a restaurant tomorrow.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.250
Thanks, bro.

03:36.420 --> 03:37.750
Listen up, crew.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.880
It's time to get serious,
so this is your new bible.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.830
Service standards,
house cocktails,

03:42.830 --> 03:45.080
et cetera, et cetera.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.960
Let's review the menu,
shall we?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.460
Honey,
did you make these?

03:48.460 --> 03:50.000
Yes.
Is there a problem?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.500
You spelled "flambÃ©"
with an "R."

03:52.500 --> 03:53.960
Uh, i-is that right?

03:53.960 --> 03:55.080
It's French, Mom,

03:55.080 --> 03:58.040
so it's either "flamber"
with an "R" or "flambÃ©."

03:58.040 --> 03:59.290
Then I would need
an accent aigu.

03:59.290 --> 04:01.000
You can ask Delilah.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.250
She spent 26 years of her life
in France.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.000
Okay.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.830
The grilled scallops are
prepared with celeriac

04:07.830 --> 04:09.170
and spicy peanuts.

04:09.170 --> 04:10.670
Which brings me
to allergens.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.380
Excuse me. Hi.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.620
Uh, I told you, you needed to
get the liquor license by today

04:14.620 --> 04:15.830
or we have to
take another gig.

04:15.830 --> 04:17.000
No, we'll get it.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.080
Yeah, and our
Certificate of Occupancy, too.

04:19.080 --> 04:20.790
You don't have
your C of O, either?

04:20.790 --> 04:23.000
Anton, bartenders
are also paid by the hour.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.670
You'll be fine.
I promise.

04:25.670 --> 04:27.920
Well, honey,
it is all about the tips.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.330
They're gonna be
making much less

04:29.330 --> 04:30.830
if they're just
slinging seltzer.

04:30.830 --> 04:32.380
Exactly.

04:32.380 --> 04:34.540
Sorry, but this just
isn't gonna work out.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.330
Oh --

04:36.330 --> 04:37.710
Thanks a lot, Mom.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.710
Uh-huh.
Take it up out of
the saddle right here.

04:40.710 --> 04:42.540
Ah! I'm up.

04:42.540 --> 04:44.420
Come on! Dig in! Push it!
Yeah!

04:46.000 --> 04:48.750
You got it! Don't quit on me!

04:48.750 --> 04:50.790
This is your day --
I got to pause you.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.170
That's my other lady.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.880
Hey.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.000
How's it going
with your mom?

04:58.210 --> 05:00.080
Say "soup spoon"
if it's really bad.

05:00.080 --> 05:01.830
What if I said "ladle"?

05:01.830 --> 05:04.040
Ohh.
I'll be right there.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.170
All right,
here's what I'm thinking.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.580
I'm gonna come up
with some signs

05:06.580 --> 05:09.620
to help you recognize when women
want to have sex with you.

05:09.620 --> 05:13.000
Okay, if I do this
that's the sign to steal home.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.080
Yep.
Think I got it.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.040
Yeah?

05:15.040 --> 05:16.420
Gary: Huh?

05:16.420 --> 05:17.830
Whoa!
Regina: Fine. I'll hold.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.250
Just put me on
with someone who can help.
Wow.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.080
I cannot believe
this place.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.540
Mm, right?
Look at that one.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.880
Always working.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.080
And this one -- Heh -- gets
more pregnant by the minute.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.920
She promised me
there aren't twins in there.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.540
Okay,
you're all caught up.

05:35.290 --> 05:37.000
Hey.
Hi.

05:39.620 --> 05:40.830
You're back.

05:40.830 --> 05:42.170
I am.

05:42.170 --> 05:43.920
How was it?
How was the tour?

05:43.920 --> 05:45.710
It was good.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.710
Well, um, this place just --
it looks amazing.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.750
Yeah, well, it's actually
a train wreck right now,

05:59.750 --> 06:01.710
and I got to try
and get her a liquor license.

06:01.710 --> 06:03.920
Excuse me.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.830
Unh-unh-unh-unh!
Maggie Bloom! No, no, no.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.210
I will carry that.

06:07.210 --> 06:08.620
What?
No, it's not heavy.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.080
It's just a bunch of hand soap
and candles for the bathroom.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.620
Let me ask you
something.
Hmm?

06:12.620 --> 06:14.620
What's the longest you've
ever gone without having sex?

06:14.620 --> 06:16.250
Uh...junior year.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.540
I thought I could
pull off baby bangs. Why?

06:18.540 --> 06:20.540
Because I'm starting
to think that Eddie

06:20.540 --> 06:22.170
has not had sex
since Jon died.

06:23.670 --> 06:25.830
That's an interesting way
to mark things.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.540
Hi! You look great.

06:27.540 --> 06:28.670
So do you.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.620
Aw. It's a wig.
Yeah.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.120
So, the point
I was trying to make

06:32.120 --> 06:35.420
is that now is exactly
when you should be having sex.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.830
Okay, I'm gonna
let you...do that.

06:44.710 --> 06:46.290
Ooh! Hello.

06:46.290 --> 06:49.210
I am all about stalking,
but who are we stalking?

06:49.210 --> 06:51.040
It's the guy
from...the gas station.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.170
From our road trip.

06:52.170 --> 06:53.960
The one who likes
Simon and Garfunkel.

06:53.960 --> 06:57.000
You tracked him down?!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.330
No.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.710
Yes.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.620
He had a bar
with a very memorable name,

07:01.620 --> 07:04.000
which allowed me
to track him down.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.790
Mm-hmm.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.120
Well.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.580
Hey, he doesn't
just own a bar.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.920
Yeah, exactly.

07:10.920 --> 07:14.080
It's Andrew Pollock
of the Pollock Restaurant group.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.420
And I thought
maybe he could help us.

07:16.420 --> 07:19.380
Oh, I definitely think
he could help you.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.170
Maybe even
with the restaurant.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.210
Will you stop that?
Delilah, call him.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.250
What do I say?
"Hello. Hi. It's me.

07:25.250 --> 07:26.830
Do you remember me
from pump 6?"

07:26.830 --> 07:28.000
That's it, because
that's what happened.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.620
That's your meet cute.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.380
I mean, the only thing that
scared him off was your ring,

07:31.380 --> 07:33.920
and you could take that off
this time.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.000
No, but it's...
professional.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.460
I need two, and not just
bartenders. I need mixologists.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.460
Yep, I'll hold.

07:41.460 --> 07:43.250
W-What is that music?

07:43.250 --> 07:44.960
It's a playlist I made
for the opening --

07:44.960 --> 07:46.420
fun '60s music.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.790
You used to love
this stuff.

07:47.790 --> 07:50.540
It's my opening,
not your oldies station.

07:50.540 --> 07:53.580
You just can't make decisions
like that without asking me.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.920
Okay,
but...sounds good.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.670
Who are you e-mailing?

07:58.670 --> 08:00.580
It's Neil.
He's wishing us good luck.

08:01.830 --> 08:03.380
You told him
about the opening?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.000
He's my brother.
Of course I did.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.210
Please tell me
he's not coming.

08:09.420 --> 08:10.710
No, he's not.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.080
He's not well enough
to travel.

08:14.170 --> 08:16.120
He's in the hospital,
actually.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.040
The, uh...
the silverware is spotty.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.920
I'm gonna have them
polish it.

08:22.620 --> 08:25.000
That's on me.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.380
I think
that you can admit

08:26.380 --> 08:28.710
that desperate times
call for desperate measures.

08:28.710 --> 08:31.880
And he...
is desperately attractive.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.040
No way.
I can't do it.

08:34.710 --> 08:36.250
Hey!
Hi.

08:36.250 --> 08:39.000
You know that's the universal
sign for watching porn, right?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.040
What's going on
in here?

08:40.040 --> 08:41.170
Porn.
It was totally porn.

08:41.170 --> 08:42.790
Yeah.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.420
Clear your history!

08:44.420 --> 08:45.750
That's a rookie mistake.

08:45.750 --> 08:46.750
Yeah.
Hello.

08:46.750 --> 08:47.830
Hi.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.290
Ed and I are leaving.

08:49.290 --> 08:51.210
Do you need anything?
Do you want anything?

08:51.210 --> 08:53.540
Need a ride?
'Cause your Uber driver is here.

08:53.540 --> 08:55.540
You can call me "Guber."

08:55.540 --> 08:57.710
Or "Gyft."

08:57.710 --> 08:59.420
Okay, I'm fine.
Thank you.

08:59.420 --> 09:03.170
I can get my own ride.
I can carry my own bags.

09:03.170 --> 09:05.880
I really appreciate you taking
the time to worry about me,

09:05.880 --> 09:07.380
but it is too much.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.790
You're worrying
about everybody now.

09:08.790 --> 09:10.380
It's Delilah, Eddie...

09:10.380 --> 09:12.710
Between that
and your positive attitude,

09:12.710 --> 09:14.080
you're really starting
to throw off

09:14.080 --> 09:15.620
the whole ecosystem
around here.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.000
But still,
that's a long time

09:19.000 --> 09:21.210
for Eddie
not to have sex, right?

09:21.210 --> 09:23.210
Regina: We do not have
enough scallops.

09:23.210 --> 09:25.290
Dante, I need you
to swing by the fish market.

09:25.290 --> 09:26.830
Dante: Yes, Chef.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.250
Do you have a second?

09:43.250 --> 09:45.790
They need help out there
with the t--

09:45.790 --> 09:48.000
Is everything okay?

09:48.000 --> 09:49.040
Honey?

09:49.040 --> 09:50.460
Actually, no.

09:51.830 --> 09:54.000
I just got an e-mail
from Neil, too.

09:55.380 --> 09:57.170
Why did you give him
my address?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.920
Because he's family,
Regina.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.620
He's just trying
to be supportive.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.330
Mm-hmm.

10:04.330 --> 10:05.580
You should really
go out there.

10:05.580 --> 10:07.330
The waiters are arranging
the tables all wrong.

10:07.330 --> 10:08.750
You know, actually,
they're doing it

10:08.750 --> 10:10.330
exactly the way
I asked them to.

10:10.330 --> 10:12.420
Really? That's how
you want the tables?

10:12.420 --> 10:14.120
Mom, my bartenders
just quit,

10:14.120 --> 10:16.420
I don't have
the paperwork to even open yet,

10:16.420 --> 10:18.460
and everything's
gone wrong.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.880
Why is it
I have waited my entire life

10:20.880 --> 10:22.040
for you to take my side?

10:22.040 --> 10:24.460
Just once take my side!

10:37.210 --> 10:39.000
Gina. Hey.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.460
What's going on?

10:40.460 --> 10:42.380
What's wrong?

10:42.380 --> 10:43.960
It -- It doesn't --
It doesn't matter.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.250
I just --

10:45.250 --> 10:46.830
I need to stay focused.
I can't get distracted.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.290
That's right, yeah.

10:48.290 --> 10:50.460
Everything is going wrong,
and we're opening tomorrow.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.620
How are we
going to do this?

10:53.620 --> 10:57.040
Hey, I'm gonna go talk
to somebody who can help us.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.500
You just stay focused
in the kitchen.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.670
I got everything else
covered, okay?

11:00.670 --> 11:02.580
Okay.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.710
We're gonna
get through this together.

11:04.710 --> 11:06.500
Yeah,
damn right we are.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.000
Rome: Why isn't Shelly
doing this?

11:13.000 --> 11:16.120
She's the one
who thinks they're...spotty.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.920
Y'all know my mother.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.620
You okay?
I'm fine.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.170
Just not gonna get
my second spin in. That's all.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.580
You've been spinning
a lot recently.

11:27.580 --> 11:29.830
If that bike could move,
I'd be in California by now.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.750
How's it feel
to still be in Boston?

11:35.880 --> 11:38.750
The meds have been out
of your system for a while now.

11:38.750 --> 11:41.250
Yeah.
But I'm fine.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.830
There are rough days,
but there were rough days

11:43.830 --> 11:45.000
on the meds, too.

11:47.830 --> 11:50.710
You used to say that
it was like wearing a heavy coat

11:50.710 --> 11:52.000
that you couldn't
take off.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.540
Days like that?

11:55.790 --> 11:58.330
Try to understand this.

11:58.330 --> 12:00.710
I want to be in control.

12:00.710 --> 12:02.330
Not some pill.

12:11.330 --> 12:12.460
Andrew: Hi.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.330
Hi.

12:14.330 --> 12:16.750
Hi. I-I don't know
if you remember me.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.790
Uh...wait a minute.

12:19.790 --> 12:20.790
No.

12:22.250 --> 12:24.170
No, I'm just kidding.
Simon and Garfunkel, right?

12:24.170 --> 12:26.330
Of course.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.830
So, what brings you
to my gin joint?

12:28.830 --> 12:30.580
Well, actually,
I could use some --

12:30.580 --> 12:34.380
some he-- some -- some advice,
some professional advice.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.880
Okay. Do you want
to grab a table?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.500
Sure. Yes.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.920
Oh.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.750
We'll, uh, have to make it
a table for three.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.790
Yeah.

12:42.790 --> 12:44.540
Are you really
a private investigator?

12:44.540 --> 12:46.000
Like, are you allowed
to tell people that?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.710
I'm not in the CIA.

12:49.120 --> 12:51.290
I'm sorry.
You're Eddie Saville, right?

12:51.290 --> 12:52.460
Gary: Oh.

12:52.460 --> 12:54.750
I'm sorry.
I'm a Red Ferns fan.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.080
Oh, don't be sorry.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.250
You guys
are touring again.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.670
We just finished.
Col, this has a bow on it.

12:59.670 --> 13:01.290
I actually
just got back today.

13:01.290 --> 13:03.420
I might've seen you
in Hartford.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.290
Yeah, I did see you.
Yeah.

13:05.290 --> 13:06.380
It was an awesome show.

13:06.380 --> 13:08.250
Awesome show.
Yeah.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.960
You guys met
in Hartford, huh?

13:09.960 --> 13:11.000
Yeah.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.380
Yeah, from afar.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.170
So, anyway...

13:14.170 --> 13:16.330
I have contacted
every Barbara Morgan

13:16.330 --> 13:18.170
I could find
on the East Coast.

13:18.170 --> 13:19.710
No luck.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.250
Do you have
any other leads for me?

13:22.250 --> 13:24.080
No.
Just the painting.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.500
Well, I've reached out
to art galleries, as well.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.830
Haven't found anyone who's shown
an artist named B. Morgan yet.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.210
But if I find her,
do I get a backstage pass?

13:32.210 --> 13:34.330
Oh, I know a guy
who can make that happen.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.960
Oh?
The tour's over.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.880
I...don't know, friend.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.500
The  tour's
never over.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.620
You okay?
Hmm?

13:41.620 --> 13:43.250
He's got a sinus infection,
is all.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.080
Oh.

13:44.080 --> 13:45.880
It's not contagious.

13:45.880 --> 13:48.380
I have some connections that can
help with the liquor license.

13:48.380 --> 13:49.880
I don't only own this place.
I have --

13:49.880 --> 13:51.670
Four other restaurants.

13:51.670 --> 13:53.210
Yes, I know.
Yeah.

13:53.210 --> 13:55.580
I may have put your name
in a search engine.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.000
How did you come
to own this place?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.960
Um...

14:02.960 --> 14:05.330
my husband died,
and he left it to us.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.920
It was the last thing
that he did.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.790
I know it's probably become
too important to me, but, uh...

14:10.790 --> 14:12.330
The good ones usually do.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.620
There's a lot
riding on it.

14:16.620 --> 14:19.080
You know, I lost my wife
three years ago.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.880
I'm -- I'm sorry.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.120
Me too.

14:23.580 --> 14:26.710
You remind me of myself
the day I opened my first place.

14:26.710 --> 14:29.040
Scared and pregnant?

14:29.040 --> 14:30.460
Determined.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.540
Excuse me.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.000
I don't want to bother you.
I just need your final menu.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
I want to get it
to the printer.

14:43.170 --> 14:44.580
Great.

14:44.580 --> 14:45.880
Thank you, sweetheart.

14:48.040 --> 14:50.830
What did he mean by
"Glad it all worked out"?

14:52.330 --> 14:53.750
What did who mean?

14:53.750 --> 14:55.290
Neil.

14:59.620 --> 15:02.170
"Glad it all worked out" --
what did he mean by that?

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
I don't know.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.460
I don't know
what the big deal is.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.210
He was thinking of you.
Is that so bad?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.420
Yeah. I don't want him
thinking of me.

15:12.420 --> 15:14.670
Ohh.
Just tell me what he meant
by "worked out."

15:16.500 --> 15:18.290
I guess he thought
you were having money problems.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.420
You guess?

15:22.830 --> 15:25.500
He knew, yes.
Okay?

15:25.500 --> 15:26.710
I told him.

15:26.710 --> 15:28.460
Don't be angry at him
for trying to help.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.170
How did he help, Mom?

15:35.380 --> 15:37.040
How did he help?

15:39.210 --> 15:41.000
The money for the restaurant
came from him.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.290
Oh, my God.

15:44.290 --> 15:47.000
Honey, I don't have
that kind of money.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.580
And -- And, look, in -- in
Neil's defense, it was just --

15:49.580 --> 15:51.250
he wanted me to tell you
that it was from him.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.210
I-I just -- I-I knew
it would only upset you.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.250
Get out of here.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.540
Oh. Regina, you just
need to calm down.

15:56.540 --> 15:57.920
Get out!

15:57.920 --> 16:00.080
I know
you don't like your uncle.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.620
I know the two of you haven't
gotten along in the past,

16:02.620 --> 16:06.120
but you have to admit,
what he has done is very nice.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.380
Neil's the one who's made

16:07.380 --> 16:09.750
all of your dreams
come true, Regina.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.620
Oh, come on.

16:16.620 --> 16:18.460
Regina, please.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.580
Gina, hey.
This is Andrew.

16:27.580 --> 16:29.710
He's gonna help us
get through this.

16:31.170 --> 16:32.420
Gina.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.080
There's nothing
to help us through.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.000
Every penny my mother gave us,
we're giving back.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.620
This restaurant
will never open.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.250
Not with me involved.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.670
I don't understand
what's going on.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.670
What's she saying?

16:59.670 --> 17:02.330
That the money
for the restaurant

17:02.330 --> 17:03.750
didn't come
from her mom.

17:03.750 --> 17:04.830
It came from Neil.

17:04.830 --> 17:05.880
Who's Neil?

17:05.880 --> 17:08.000
Her uncle.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.040
I don't know him.
He wasn't even at our wedding.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.670
And now she won't...

17:12.670 --> 17:14.120
she won't
come out of there.

17:17.250 --> 17:19.210
She needs you.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.120
You do know these tables
are too small, right?

17:29.120 --> 17:31.790
Yes. Just put it
on the list.

17:31.790 --> 17:33.540
Guess I missed
all the drama, huh?

17:33.540 --> 17:35.710
Well, Maggie's over there now.
Maybe that'll help.

17:35.710 --> 17:38.670
I refuse to believe she doesn't
want this restaurant to open.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.000
Who's the happy fixer?

17:42.000 --> 17:44.880
Oh. That, um --
it's Andrew.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.880
He's been very helpful.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.250
He's got like
five restaurants.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.500
Oh, really?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.670
And he just came over
to help you out, huh?

17:51.670 --> 17:53.710
I mean, he seems a little tall
for a guardian angel.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.500
You think he -- he's really
just here to help out?

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
I mean, come on.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.210
Hi.
Hi.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.620
Nice to meet you.
I'm Andrew Pollock.

18:02.620 --> 18:04.040
Gary.

18:04.040 --> 18:05.710
Mendez.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.080
Okay, I got
your liquor license.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.040
Wow. Thank you.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.210
Wow, indeed.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.290
How much does a bribe
cost these days?

18:12.290 --> 18:14.210
Nice to meet you, Gary.

18:14.210 --> 18:16.380
Um, okay, I'll see you
in the morning.
Okay.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.580
Bye.
Bye.

18:18.580 --> 18:19.790
Thank you.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.960
We're gonna
have to exchange these.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.080
You know what?
I'll call my guy.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.120
Great.
See you tomorrow.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.170
Yeah, he's got
a tablecloth guy.

18:27.170 --> 18:29.330
What's your problem?
I don't have a problem.

18:29.330 --> 18:33.000
But if I did, I bet you
Andrew could fix it.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.170
âª Oh, Jeanie, say you'll
be there when I come back âª

18:40.000 --> 18:42.290
âª Say nothing's changed âª

18:42.290 --> 18:43.670
âª I love you âª

18:45.080 --> 18:46.620
âª And that's a fact âª

18:48.750 --> 18:50.920
Nice!

18:50.920 --> 18:54.500
So...who was Jeanie?

18:54.500 --> 18:56.670
I want
all the liner notes.

18:56.670 --> 18:59.080
I'd been on the road
a lot,

18:59.080 --> 19:01.710
and I was
really missing...

19:03.080 --> 19:05.540
...this burger place
called Jean's.

19:07.170 --> 19:09.170
I thought she was
some long-lost love.

19:09.170 --> 19:10.670
Well, you haven't had
their cheese fries.

19:10.670 --> 19:12.080
Well, I guess not.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.960
So...

19:34.790 --> 19:37.000
You okay?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.210
Yeah.

19:41.750 --> 19:42.960
Uh, no.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.120
I'm sorry.

19:46.540 --> 19:48.210
Look, um...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.710
...the thing is,
it's not that I don't want to.

19:52.710 --> 19:56.880
But my life is just
very confusing right now.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.500
No.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.250
I get it.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.000
You don't have to be
an investigator to know

20:02.000 --> 20:03.880
that you are
on the rebound.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.670
Oh. I bet
that's my office.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.460
No. Get it.
It's fine.

20:08.460 --> 20:11.210
This can't be
all for naught.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.080
She's coming back,
right?

20:13.080 --> 20:14.250
'Course she is.
Come on.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.290
Look, all I, uh...

20:20.290 --> 20:23.170
all I meant earlier was,
you know, you should --

20:23.170 --> 20:24.830
you should be careful,
okay?

20:24.830 --> 20:28.420
'Cause...y-you trust people
too much.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.290
I can take care
of myself.

20:32.290 --> 20:34.500
Let's lock up.

20:38.670 --> 20:39.830
Dude.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.330
Hey. I'm with Joanna.

20:41.330 --> 20:43.040
Hello, Joanna.
Joanna: Hi.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.710
Joanna just heard
from a gallery

20:44.710 --> 20:47.790
who showed an artist
named B. Morgan.

20:47.790 --> 20:49.000
You're kidding me.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.540
Hey, Gina,
I have Maggie with me.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.170
You think
we can come in?

21:16.380 --> 21:18.290
I was supposed to go
to this dance.

21:20.670 --> 21:21.880
I wanted to.

21:23.420 --> 21:26.170
Everyone else went.

21:26.170 --> 21:28.920
I wasn't invited.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.830
It kind of broke my heart.

21:30.830 --> 21:33.420
Dances are really important
to teenagers.

21:33.420 --> 21:36.500
I wasn't a teenager.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.250
I was only 12.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.750
It felt like
no one asked me

21:41.750 --> 21:44.290
because I was the only
black girl in my class.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.290
I was in my room...

21:49.290 --> 21:51.920
feeling sorry
for myself.

21:51.920 --> 21:52.790
He knocked on the door.

21:54.580 --> 21:58.290
He'd found out
about the dance.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.080
He felt bad for me.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.580
He said, "Don't worry
about the boys at school.

22:05.580 --> 22:07.120
I think you're beautiful."

22:13.080 --> 22:14.500
And then...

22:18.210 --> 22:20.880
...I...took my shirt off.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.380
He asked me to.

22:26.500 --> 22:27.920
Gina.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.380
Yeah, I know.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.670
I know.
I shouldn't have.

22:32.670 --> 22:33.880
That's not what I meant.

22:33.880 --> 22:38.830
But I needed to feel beautiful
that night.

22:38.830 --> 22:40.540
I needed to feel accepted.

22:42.790 --> 22:44.960
I just wanted him
to console me.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.710
When he came closer,
I didn't move away.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.040
I let him touch me.

22:59.170 --> 23:01.330
I've never
told anyone that.

23:04.330 --> 23:07.500
I'm just so ashamed.

23:09.500 --> 23:13.460
Regina, you need
to listen to me.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.960
You were 12.

23:16.380 --> 23:18.210
You didn't do anything.

23:20.170 --> 23:23.170
And you did not let him
do anything.

23:23.170 --> 23:25.500
He did it to you.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.210
No.

23:27.210 --> 23:28.750
It's not like
he raped me.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.670
No, what he did
was sexual assault.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.670
So, the -- the next day,
I tried to tell my mother.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.250
And...

23:45.210 --> 23:46.750
...she, uh...

23:49.210 --> 23:51.620
...all she said to me was...

23:58.250 --> 24:01.120
..."You must have
misunderstood him.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.000
He was just trying
to comfort you."

24:05.330 --> 24:08.670
And all I thought
was that she was right.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.080
I was too flirty.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.880
No. No.

24:14.880 --> 24:17.250
Gina, you did not
misunderstand anything.
I did.

24:17.250 --> 24:19.290
No. What happened to you
was not your fault.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.120
Listen to her, Gina.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.670
You were molested.

24:22.670 --> 24:26.580
Oh, my God.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.750
Gina, baby.

24:49.750 --> 24:52.460
What can I do?

24:52.460 --> 24:55.580
I didn't tell you
because it was better

24:55.580 --> 24:57.250
to pretend
it never happened.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.000
I didn't want it
to be real.

25:02.290 --> 25:04.790
I understand that.

25:04.790 --> 25:06.500
I have to go see him.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.960
Now.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.290
Wait. You've --
You've kept this in for so long.

25:10.290 --> 25:14.120
Do you -- Do you even know
what you would say to him?

25:14.120 --> 25:15.710
Wait until you're ready.

25:15.710 --> 25:18.000
Ready? I --

25:18.000 --> 25:21.210
I won't be ready
until after I do it.

25:21.210 --> 25:23.460
Do you remember
what Jon told me?

25:23.460 --> 25:25.120
What I keep
telling myself --

25:25.120 --> 25:27.380
"You can someday yourself
out of a life."

25:28.830 --> 25:32.290
This is not about
the restaurant anymore.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.210
I have to go.

25:34.210 --> 25:36.420
He can't think
that I took that money.

25:36.420 --> 25:38.170
Okay. Okay.

25:38.170 --> 25:40.460
Two conditions.

25:40.460 --> 25:42.500
I'm driving...

25:42.500 --> 25:44.330
and we're bringing
backup.

25:44.330 --> 25:45.830
Gary: You're really gonna go
on a two-hour road trip

25:45.830 --> 25:47.540
and not tell me
where you're going?

25:47.540 --> 25:49.880
You're headed to
some obscure gallery.
What's the difference?

25:49.880 --> 25:50.830
I told you
where I'm going.

25:50.830 --> 25:52.040
I will be fine.

25:52.040 --> 25:53.670
I just want you
to take care of yourself.

25:53.670 --> 25:55.040
That's all this is.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.210
You got one more round of chemo
before you get the surgery.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.500
If I'm lucky.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.210
Okay, that's it.
That's --

26:00.210 --> 26:02.960
See, this is the attitude
that I don't care for.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.250
But you know what?

26:04.250 --> 26:07.250
Just to keep you
thinking positive,

26:07.250 --> 26:10.250
I have made a variety of
artisan sandwiches for the road.

26:10.250 --> 26:11.620
San--

26:11.620 --> 26:13.830
Gary.
I was serious.

26:13.830 --> 26:15.290
In any ecosystem,

26:15.290 --> 26:18.000
qualitatively different
influences oppose each other.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.210
What the heck
are you talking about?

26:19.210 --> 26:21.120
In biochemistry --
which I took --

26:21.120 --> 26:23.540
one set of chemicals drives
the system in one direction,

26:23.540 --> 26:25.670
and another set drives it
in the opposing direction.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.290
Sugar is sweet,

26:27.290 --> 26:29.710
but without insulin,
it will kill you.

26:29.710 --> 26:34.420
You were born to be insulin,
Gary -- the negative feedback.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.540
Please don't get too sticky.
We need you on that wall.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.750
The food's in the bag.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.080
I made
too many sandwiches.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.000
Mm-hmm.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.830
Now, go steal some candy
from a baby.

26:47.830 --> 26:49.290
It'll make me feel better.

26:50.540 --> 26:53.120
I can't talk.
I can't.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.790
How much longer
till we get there?

26:54.790 --> 26:56.170
Like an hour.

26:56.170 --> 26:58.000
Do you know
what you want to say?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.960
I'll know
when I get there.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.500
Maybe you should practice.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.290
No.

27:02.290 --> 27:03.500
Well, he's right.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.080
You should
probably figure out

27:05.080 --> 27:06.290
what you want
to get out of this.

27:08.080 --> 27:10.460
I want him
to acknowledge what happened,

27:10.460 --> 27:12.000
say he's sorry.

27:14.540 --> 27:16.330
Yeah,
he might not do that.

27:18.380 --> 27:21.750
Fine. He can say
what he wants.

27:21.750 --> 27:23.920
But I'm telling him
I know what happened.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.500
I'm looking him
straight in the eyes

27:25.500 --> 27:27.420
and telling him
I know what he did.

27:33.620 --> 27:34.540
Thank you.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.540
Andrew.

27:37.540 --> 27:41.540
One brand-new
liquor license.

27:41.540 --> 27:43.460
Thank you.

27:43.460 --> 27:45.250
I took the liberty
of putting it under glass.

27:45.250 --> 27:46.710
Wow.

27:46.710 --> 27:48.750
Let's hang it.
Let's.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.670
Oh, and I got you
two bartenders.

27:50.670 --> 27:51.960
You did?!
Yeah.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.620
Thank -- Thank you.

27:53.620 --> 27:55.080
Have you heard
from Regina yet?

27:55.080 --> 27:56.960
No, not yet.
I keep calling.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.620
It's still early, though.
She'll -- She'll be here.

27:59.620 --> 28:02.580
No, sir, I'm sorry. I can't
give you that information.

28:02.580 --> 28:03.960
You need to speak
to the attending on service --

28:03.960 --> 28:05.040
Dr. Anthony.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.210
Okay, we --
we don't need a doctor.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.250
We just need this guy's
room number. That's it.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.210
I understand that, sir.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.620
Um...I don't know
exactly where he is,

28:12.620 --> 28:14.710
but I will try
and page him for you.
Okay, let's page him.

28:14.710 --> 28:16.750
No, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, don't page him. Just --

28:16.750 --> 28:19.540
And, please, kindly look me in
my eye while I'm talking to you.

28:19.540 --> 28:23.120
Um, why is it that Dr. Anthony
can talk to me and you cannot?

28:23.120 --> 28:24.500
Uh, I'm just --

28:24.500 --> 28:26.710
Take me -- Take me through
your entire day. Let's do that.

28:26.710 --> 28:28.170
How about --
How about, say, like,

28:28.170 --> 28:30.080
the beginning of your day
starts here?

28:30.080 --> 28:31.710
Sir, I'm --
Like, in this area.
This is the beginning.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.580
Over this way, right?

28:34.580 --> 28:37.210
So let's -- let's start here.
Just walk me through that.

28:37.210 --> 28:39.250
Sir, I'm sorry.
There are rules at a hospital.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.040
I believe in rules.
I believe in rules.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.920
I'm a big fan of rules,
okay?

28:42.920 --> 28:44.790
Built my house
with all rulers.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.330
Did not use
one tape measure.

28:46.330 --> 28:48.460
He's in room 306.

29:40.330 --> 29:42.170
Excuse me.

29:42.170 --> 29:43.920
I'm looking
for Neil Bishop.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.210
Are you Shelly?

29:46.210 --> 29:48.460
No, I'm her daughter.

29:48.460 --> 29:49.170
Why?

29:51.120 --> 29:53.580
Your uncle died
a few hours ago.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.040
I'm sorry you didn't
get to say goodbye.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.290
They look happy.

30:06.290 --> 30:08.040
They won't diagnose it
for six months,

30:08.040 --> 30:10.080
but trust me --
they all have Lyme disease.

30:12.460 --> 30:14.000
I'm trying to steal candy
from a baby.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.420
It's a homework
assignment.

30:15.420 --> 30:16.620
Mm.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.000
I found something,
gentlemen.

30:19.670 --> 30:21.710
We had one left.

30:21.710 --> 30:24.580
It was mislabeled, or otherwise
it probably would've sold.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.580
Her last piece sold a few years
ago, before I was here.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.040
But it is funny --

30:32.040 --> 30:34.000
all of her work was purchased
by the same person.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.670
Let me guess --
Jon Dixon.

30:35.670 --> 30:36.540
You know him?

30:36.540 --> 30:38.710
We sure do.

30:38.710 --> 30:40.620
Where'd you send the money,
if you don't mind my asking?

30:44.880 --> 30:47.080
237 Wickenden Street.
Number 5.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.420
I was there.
She moved.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.580
I feel worse.

30:55.580 --> 30:58.000
I feel cheated.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.830
Like he did it
to me twice.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.000
Oh, my God.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.040
She's here.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.960
I want to...
go out the back way.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.250
Aw, come on.
Wait, babe.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.960
No, no. I told her.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.750
I was 12 years old.

31:16.750 --> 31:20.000
What the hell did I have to tell
her to get her to believe me?

31:20.000 --> 31:23.250
I avoided that man
my entire life,

31:23.250 --> 31:26.290
and she pretended like --
like it never happened.

31:26.290 --> 31:28.790
And what, am I supposed to
tell her all over again?

31:28.790 --> 31:30.580
As if she'd hear me?

31:30.580 --> 31:31.920
Gina, I want
to say something,

31:31.920 --> 31:33.620
and this could be
totally off base,

31:33.620 --> 31:35.920
and this does not
excuse anything,

31:35.920 --> 31:37.620
but there could be
a reason

31:37.620 --> 31:39.500
why she wasn't able
to be there for you.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.710
It's unlikely that
your uncle only molested you.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.500
I mean, if he did this
to his niece,

31:47.500 --> 31:49.000
there's a good chance
he was doing it to other girls.

31:50.750 --> 31:52.540
And maybe even
his little sister.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.830
And if that's the case,
you know,

31:58.830 --> 32:01.000
accepting your truth

32:01.000 --> 32:04.120
would have made her
have to face her own.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.460
You came here
to talk to him.

32:10.460 --> 32:11.920
He doesn't matter
anymore.

32:14.040 --> 32:16.790
You two cannot
continue on like this.

32:16.790 --> 32:19.580
Gina,
you have come this far.

32:50.790 --> 32:52.790
I don't know why you're here,
but I have to get inside.

32:52.790 --> 32:54.120
No, Mom. Mom.
What?

32:56.080 --> 32:58.710
What did he do to you?

32:58.710 --> 33:01.040
What are you talking about?
Neil didn't do anything to me.

33:01.040 --> 33:01.920
Mom.

33:09.670 --> 33:11.750
I called Dr. Heller.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.580
I need to take off
the coat.

33:15.420 --> 33:17.750
I'm getting back
on the antidepressants.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.000
I'm proud of you.

33:20.330 --> 33:22.500
I'm proud of her.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.790
That's crazy. Thanks a lot,
Captain. Thanks for coming down.

33:45.790 --> 33:46.960
I'll be in touch.

33:49.460 --> 33:50.960
Hey.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.210
I didn't see you there.

33:52.210 --> 33:53.750
That's 'cause
I snuck up on you.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.420
I just finalized
the Certificate of Occupancy.

33:56.420 --> 33:57.670
No kidding!
Yep.

33:57.670 --> 33:59.670
That's the hat trick,
isn't it?

33:59.670 --> 34:02.290
The liquor license,
C of O, bartenders.

34:02.290 --> 34:04.790
What's next? A good review
from The Boston Globe?

34:04.790 --> 34:06.380
Let's hope.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.790
Let me ask you something.

34:08.790 --> 34:11.750
You're a handsome,
successful dude.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.830
Don't you have a life?

34:13.830 --> 34:16.120
Why are you so interested
in a pregnant widow?

34:16.120 --> 34:17.920
Isn't it possible
I just want to help her out?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.580
It's possible.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.540
Unlikely.

34:21.540 --> 34:23.620
You don't really like me,
do you?

34:23.620 --> 34:26.750
I don't like anything
that's too good to be true.

34:32.460 --> 34:35.380
All right, this is her
recipe book with all her notes.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.790
Hopefully,
that will keep you going.

34:36.790 --> 34:38.290
She better get here soon.

34:38.290 --> 34:40.750
You can't open a restaurant
without a chef. It's a thing.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.170
Hey!

34:45.170 --> 34:47.000
Hey.
I'm coming home.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.170
Thank God.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.000
Tell the kitchen
I'm coming.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.080
Okay.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.620
She is on her way.

34:59.540 --> 35:01.000
It's all in the details,
right?

35:01.000 --> 35:03.750
Yeah. It's nice to finally
have time for them.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.040
Good luck tonight.

35:05.040 --> 35:09.000
Try to take a moment
to experience it.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.960
You're gonna want to remember it
for the rest of your life.

35:10.960 --> 35:12.330
You're not coming?

35:12.330 --> 35:14.790
No, no. This is
your opening, not mine.

35:14.790 --> 35:15.830
I'll call you, okay?

35:15.830 --> 35:17.120
Okay.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.830
Thank you
for everything.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.710
Oh, uh...

35:21.710 --> 35:24.380
your friend Gary --
is he okay?

35:24.380 --> 35:26.000
Yeah. Why?

35:29.000 --> 35:31.210
Hey --
What are you doing?

35:31.210 --> 35:32.790
Don't worry.
I'm not stealing booze.

35:32.790 --> 35:35.620
I'm just looking
for the CÃ®roc.

35:35.620 --> 35:37.250
Why are you
terrorizing Andrew?

35:37.250 --> 35:39.080
All he's trying to do
is help me.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.500
You serious? You came back here
to tell me that?

35:41.500 --> 35:43.790
I'm just trying to understand
what the problem is.

35:43.790 --> 35:46.210
There's no problem, D.
What? Did Andrew say
there's a problem?

35:46.210 --> 35:48.210
I'm just --

35:48.210 --> 35:50.330
I'm just trying
to keep everybody safe.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.830
No, no, you're trying
to control everyone.

35:55.330 --> 35:57.210
Okay.
Maybe I am.

35:57.210 --> 35:58.000
Well, why?

35:58.000 --> 36:01.420
I don't know...why.

36:14.580 --> 36:16.920
I cannot lose her.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.290
I know.

36:21.290 --> 36:22.620
Hey.

36:22.620 --> 36:25.000
Come here.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.790
Deejay: And are you ready
for a '60s block?

36:27.790 --> 36:29.330
103.3 Boston.
Change it.

36:29.330 --> 36:31.250
Regina doesn't like
this music.

36:31.250 --> 36:33.710
Uh, I like your music
just fine, Mom.

36:33.710 --> 36:37.420
An oldie but a goodie --
Petula Clark's "Downtown."

36:37.420 --> 36:40.880
Clark: âª When you're alone
and life is making you lonely âª

36:40.880 --> 36:43.670
âª You can always go âª

36:43.670 --> 36:45.290
âª Downtown âª
âª Downtown âª

36:45.290 --> 36:47.000
âª When you've got worries âª

36:47.000 --> 36:51.500
âª All the noise and the hurry
seems to help, I know âª

36:51.500 --> 36:53.290
âª Downtown âª

36:53.290 --> 36:57.460
âª Just listen to the music
of the traffic in the city âª

36:57.460 --> 37:01.290
âª Linger on the sidewalk where
the neon signs are pretty âª

37:01.290 --> 37:03.920
âª How can you lose? âª

37:03.920 --> 37:06.830
âª The lights are
much brighter there âª

37:06.830 --> 37:09.380
âª You can forget
all your troubles âª

37:09.380 --> 37:10.880
âª Forget all your cares âª

37:10.880 --> 37:13.710
âª So go downtown âª

37:13.710 --> 37:18.500
âª Everything's waiting for you âª

37:18.500 --> 37:20.120
Man: Right behind you.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.330
Beautiful!

37:28.330 --> 37:29.620
Okay.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.670
Wait! Garnish!

37:31.670 --> 37:33.460
All right,
position 2, table 8.

37:33.460 --> 37:34.420
Yes, Chef.
Wait!

37:36.000 --> 37:37.380
All right,
how far out are my scallops?

37:37.380 --> 37:39.080
Sandra: One minute.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.460
I can't believe
I'm a waiter.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.960
How come
he gets to be a waiter?!

37:44.960 --> 37:46.830
-Go to table 10.
-Yes, Chef.

37:46.830 --> 37:49.250
Baby,
it is crazy out there.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.170
It is a madhouse.
But in a -- in a good way.

37:51.170 --> 37:52.580
People are freaking out,
it's so good.

37:52.580 --> 37:54.460
Someone slipped me a $20
to be seated at the bar.

37:54.460 --> 37:55.710
Okay?
I'm in the wrong business.

37:55.710 --> 37:57.500
Walk-in -- table 4.
Four covers.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.040
I need two burratas
and two cauliflowers.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.330
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

38:00.330 --> 38:02.710
How the mighty have fallen!

38:02.710 --> 38:06.210
You are in a sad episode of
"Behind the Music," my friend.

38:14.960 --> 38:16.120
Here you go --
table 21.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.500
Thank you.
Thanks.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.170
Look at
what you did!

38:30.170 --> 38:32.250
I know.
Hard to believe.

38:36.040 --> 38:37.000
D.

38:38.830 --> 38:40.790
You took your ring off.

38:40.790 --> 38:42.920
I did.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.250
You didn't do that
for Andrew, did you?

38:45.250 --> 38:47.380
No.

38:47.380 --> 38:49.210
I did it for myself.

38:52.790 --> 38:54.040
Last one, Chef.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.330
All right, 86 oysters.
Man: Got it, Chef.

38:55.330 --> 38:58.250
Do you know what is happening
out there right now?

38:58.250 --> 39:00.790
Uh...people are eating food,
I hope.

39:00.790 --> 39:03.460
No, they are salivating
over the food.

39:03.460 --> 39:05.670
They are savoring
every bite.

39:05.670 --> 39:06.670
Oh, stop it.

39:06.670 --> 39:07.920
No! You have to see.
Come on.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.080
I'm a little busy
right now.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.710
I got this.
Go take a peek.

39:10.710 --> 39:12.000
Huh? Oh.
Go.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.170
Yeah, come on.
Man: Go, go.

39:13.170 --> 39:14.920
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

39:19.380 --> 39:20.670
Wow.

39:20.670 --> 39:21.670
Go out there!
No, I can't.

39:21.670 --> 39:22.920
Go out!

39:34.710 --> 39:36.250
Man: There's our chef.

39:47.710 --> 39:52.880
âª And you may find somebody kind
to help and understand you âª

39:52.880 --> 39:57.380
âª Someone who is just like you
and needs a gentle hand âª

39:57.380 --> 39:59.790
âª To guide them along âª

40:04.170 --> 40:05.540
That was quite a night.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.460
Yeah.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.500
I'm giving away the money --
all of it.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.080
To a woman's shelter.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.120
But...
what are you gonna do?

40:18.120 --> 40:20.250
Delilah met someone
who might want to invest, so...

40:21.670 --> 40:22.790
Regina --

40:22.790 --> 40:24.620
Mom, it's...

40:24.620 --> 40:26.670
it's okay.

40:26.670 --> 40:29.500
There's still stuff
you and I have to work out.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.920
I know.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.500
We'll get there.

40:37.380 --> 40:39.380
Do you remember
the night your dad left?

40:41.500 --> 40:45.250
You took my hand and told me
everything was gonna be okay.

40:45.250 --> 40:47.120
You were 8.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.210
And even then,
you were braver than me.

40:51.120 --> 40:53.250
I thought I could never
be more proud of you
than I was that day,

40:53.250 --> 40:55.420
but, honey,
right now, I am.

40:59.250 --> 41:00.880
By the way,
I know you didn't eat.

41:02.170 --> 41:04.170
Well, I was
a little too nervous.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.920
Come on.
I'll make you your favorite.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.540
Really?
Scallops.

41:08.540 --> 41:10.790
Split 'em with me?
Yes.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.210
What can I do?

41:14.210 --> 41:16.710
âª Downtown âª

41:16.710 --> 41:19.330
âª Downtown âª

41:19.330 --> 41:21.710
âª Downtown âª

41:21.710 --> 41:24.170
âª Downtown âª

41:24.170 --> 41:26.500
But I realize,
as I'm doing this, that I --

41:26.500 --> 41:28.120
there -- there's probably
nothing I can say

41:28.120 --> 41:30.670
that can make this make sense.

41:30.670 --> 41:32.250
Uh...

41:32.250 --> 41:33.710
Except just...

41:35.920 --> 41:37.540
...I'm sorry, Barbara.

41:37.540 --> 41:38.670
Patrick: Mom!

41:41.170 --> 41:42.380
I'm coming.
