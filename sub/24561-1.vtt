32:35.519 --> 32:36.454
That's true.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.486
Props, Charles.

32:38.488 --> 32:39.753
Back at you.

32:39.755 --> 32:41.191
You guys know each other?

32:42.359 --> 32:43.327
Yeah.

32:46.629 --> 32:48.062
Look.

32:48.064 --> 32:51.568
Is there any way possible you can
give me a lift to Shelter Island?

32:52.602 --> 32:53.702
Yeah, I could do that.

32:53.704 --> 32:55.036
Oh, good. Awesome.

32:55.038 --> 32:56.207
Ouch!

32:56.974 --> 32:58.176
[groans]

32:58.442 --> 32:59.241
What?

32:59.243 --> 33:01.611
You detached so abruptly.

33:03.914 --> 33:07.315
So without ceremony
of any kind.

33:07.317 --> 33:08.482
I...

33:08.484 --> 33:09.684
I apologize.

33:09.686 --> 33:10.855
It's all right.

Youth.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.226
You enjoyed the show?

33:19.228 --> 33:23.098
Yeah. Yeah, man. You were...
You were incredible.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.065
You're like a god.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.136
[exclaims]

33:27.070 --> 33:28.371
I can't catch them.

33:32.042 --> 33:34.675
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:34.677 --> 33:38.882
Just look at these glowy things
flying around my face.

33:42.919 --> 33:43.821
Kale?

33:44.855 --> 33:45.790
Yeah?

33:46.822 --> 33:48.155
Did you have the punch?

33:48.157 --> 33:49.526
- [brakes screeching]
- [grunts]

33:49.993 --> 33:51.462
Ow! Fuck!

33:52.396 --> 33:54.128
[whispers] It's a fairy.

33:54.130 --> 33:55.763
It's a fairy.

33:55.765 --> 33:56.833
It's not a fairy.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.233
The punch was spiked.

33:59.235 --> 34:01.405
It's a group of fairies.

34:02.438 --> 34:04.405
They're meeting
about something.

34:04.407 --> 34:07.277
No. They're not meeting.

34:09.446 --> 34:11.779
- Kale...
- No, it's what they're doing.

34:11.781 --> 34:13.181
Kale, no. What are you doing?

34:13.183 --> 34:15.150
Kale? Kale, get back on the...

34:15.152 --> 34:17.251
What are you doing?
No, Kale. Stop!

34:17.253 --> 34:19.688
Stop! Stop the car. Stop!

34:19.690 --> 34:20.654
Kale, stop!

34:20.656 --> 34:22.458
Just stop, please, stop!

34:22.993 --> 34:24.161
Shh.

34:24.994 --> 34:26.527
Keep your voice down,

34:26.529 --> 34:29.232
or we won't be able to hear
the fairies' secrets.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.601
Okay.

34:34.071 --> 34:35.773
You're hallucinating.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.507
So...

34:40.509 --> 34:43.244
you're just gonna
give me the keys.

34:43.246 --> 34:46.248
Ow! Ow! What the...

34:46.250 --> 34:47.715
You're a muggle.

34:47.717 --> 34:48.949
A muggle?

34:48.951 --> 34:50.687
Like a Harry Potter muggle?

34:51.154 --> 34:52.456
Hey.

34:53.522 --> 34:54.591
Kale.

34:55.625 --> 34:57.761
Kale, get back
in the car! Kale!

34:58.795 --> 34:59.793
Kale?

34:59.795 --> 35:01.096
Kale, get back in the car.

35:01.098 --> 35:02.730
Kale, where are you going?

35:02.732 --> 35:03.965
Kale, give me the keys.

35:03.967 --> 35:05.203
Give me the keys, Kale.

35:05.802 --> 35:07.438
Kale, no! Kale!

35:08.170 --> 35:09.339
Wonderful.

[Kale whispering]
Come here. It's okay.

35:15.177 --> 35:17.212
Shh. I'm friendly.

35:17.214 --> 35:18.416
Kale?

35:18.848 --> 35:20.181
Come here.

35:20.183 --> 35:21.851
[Kale whistling]

35:34.797 --> 35:35.899
Okay, then.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.344
[leaves rustling]

36:16.772 --> 36:18.041
I go this way now.

36:19.909 --> 36:20.911
Okay.

36:22.779 --> 36:23.748
You wanna come?

36:24.181 --> 36:25.349
No.

37:07.324 --> 37:09.224
That's a great
painting of you.

37:09.226 --> 37:10.494
It's not me.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.994
[laughs] Right.

37:12.996 --> 37:13.931
Right what?

37:17.333 --> 37:18.366
Okay.

37:18.368 --> 37:21.069
Um, could I use your phone?

37:21.071 --> 37:23.438
Sorry. It's a business line.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.706
It'll only take a second.

37:24.708 --> 37:27.675
I just...
I need to call a cab.

37:27.677 --> 37:31.545
I can't tie up the business
line with personal calls.

37:31.547 --> 37:35.518
What if I let everyone in here
make personal calls, hmm?

37:36.819 --> 37:38.319
Okay.

37:38.321 --> 37:40.056
Might I use your restroom?

37:40.723 --> 37:41.926
Customers only.

37:43.627 --> 37:45.762
I would like one scoop
of rum and raisin, please.

37:48.831 --> 37:50.134
Plain or sugar?

37:51.735 --> 37:52.703
Cup.

37:59.775 --> 38:01.946
Uh, where do you think
you're going?

38:02.411 --> 38:03.513
Bathroom.

38:04.447 --> 38:05.980
I have to ring you up first.

38:05.982 --> 38:09.719
You want me to wait and go in
the bathroom with my ice cream?

38:10.554 --> 38:14.322
I have to ring you up first.

38:14.324 --> 38:15.493
Fine.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.199
Three seventy-nine.

38:25.201 --> 38:28.268
I just realized that I left
my wallet somewhere, okay?

38:28.270 --> 38:29.837
So you're not gonna buy it?

38:29.839 --> 38:31.141
Well, I guess not.

38:33.243 --> 38:34.541
What am I supposed
to do with this?

38:34.543 --> 38:35.742
It's melting.

38:35.744 --> 38:37.110
Excuse me?

38:37.112 --> 38:38.980
I scooped this for you.

38:38.982 --> 38:40.047
It's yours.

38:40.049 --> 38:42.452
I didn't even touch it.
Just put it back.

38:43.319 --> 38:44.719
Can I just put it back?

38:44.721 --> 38:46.788
- Sure, you can!
- Then who's gonna want it?

38:46.790 --> 38:48.889
That'd be like eating
someone else's chewed gum.

38:48.891 --> 38:52.061
That's nothing like eating
someone else's chewed gum, sir.

38:55.065 --> 38:57.232
Mom!

38:57.234 --> 38:58.668
[woman] What is it, Donny?

38:59.969 --> 39:01.536
He said he wanted
to use the bathroom.

39:01.538 --> 39:03.204
I told him the bathroom
is only for paying customers.

39:03.206 --> 39:05.639
- Okay, slow down.
- But he said he's gonna buy ice cream.

39:05.641 --> 39:07.308
- But then he said he doesn't want it.
- Slow down.

39:07.310 --> 39:08.909
But now, it's melting!

39:08.911 --> 39:10.915
- Donny...
- I don't know what to do!

39:11.348 --> 39:12.583
In the freezer.

39:13.817 --> 39:15.019
[exhales]

39:16.552 --> 39:18.018
You say you lost your wallet?

39:18.020 --> 39:21.021
Look, I don't even care
about the ice cream.

39:21.023 --> 39:25.025
I just came in here to try and use
the phone so that I can call a cab,

39:25.027 --> 39:28.429
which is irrelevant now
because I don't have a wallet!

39:28.431 --> 39:30.030
Do you need the freezer too?

39:30.032 --> 39:31.101
No!

39:31.567 --> 39:32.869
I'm fine!

39:33.969 --> 39:37.304
So you wanted an ice cream
to make you happy?

39:37.306 --> 39:40.708
No, I only ordered
the ice cream

39:40.710 --> 39:45.081
because otherwise Donny wouldn't let
me use the customers only bathroom.

39:46.148 --> 39:47.715
Donny, soft liquor.

39:47.717 --> 39:50.684
Now, you let this poor boy
who's had a difficult night

39:50.686 --> 39:52.623
go and use our potty.

39:54.456 --> 39:55.725
Thank you.

40:04.768 --> 40:06.634
Everything come out all right?

40:06.636 --> 40:08.873
From the speed of things,
it was number one.

40:10.272 --> 40:11.338
Yep.

40:11.340 --> 40:13.675
Come join us for a treat.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.876
Uh, no, I'd love to,
but I really gotta go.

40:15.878 --> 40:20.784
I thought Donny told you that our
facilities are for customers only.

40:21.518 --> 40:22.820
Join us.

40:25.188 --> 40:26.123
Great.

40:28.023 --> 40:29.025
Thank you.

40:33.395 --> 40:35.131
Here you go.

40:37.833 --> 40:39.602
Aah.

Aah.

Good, isn't it?

Creamy.

40:51.047 --> 40:52.081
Mm-hmm.

40:53.183 --> 40:54.114
Take another.

40:54.116 --> 40:55.215
You know what?
I got this.

40:55.217 --> 40:56.918
Oh.

40:56.920 --> 40:58.255
- If you don't mind.
- [chuckles]

41:01.857 --> 41:02.993
Mmm.

41:05.561 --> 41:07.063
You know what?
This was...

41:07.998 --> 41:11.034
Mmm. This was great.
Thank you.

41:12.034 --> 41:13.603
Are you two friends?

41:15.839 --> 41:18.572
Yeah. Yeah, we're friends.

41:18.574 --> 41:20.810
Guess you're in the gang now.

41:21.210 --> 41:22.543

41:22.545 --> 41:24.244
Donny doesn't have
many friends

41:24.246 --> 41:28.049

store and taking care of me.

41:28.051 --> 41:31.119
When Donny's daddy died,
it was just us.

41:31.121 --> 41:34.023
So he doesn't get much
of a chance to get out.

41:36.726 --> 41:38.125
That's too bad.

41:38.127 --> 41:41.195
So I can tell
you ain't from these parts.

41:41.197 --> 41:42.329
Yeah.

41:42.331 --> 41:44.132
I'm just trying to get
to a party on Shelter Island

41:44.134 --> 41:47.101
so I can find a person that knows
the address where I'm staying.

41:47.103 --> 41:48.469
[sighs]

41:48.471 --> 41:51.072
A party. That sounds fun.

41:51.074 --> 41:53.978
Yeah, maybe Donny
can come with you.

41:56.813 --> 41:58.215
I don't know about that.

41:58.815 --> 42:00.784
You said you were friends.

42:01.418 --> 42:04.355
And if you take Donny here,

42:06.389 --> 42:08.025
you could use our car.

this thing off?

Yeah. This costs money.
