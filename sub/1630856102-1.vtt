00:54.750 --> 00:56.875
-  Help you down?
-  Can you manage there?

00:56.875 --> 00:58.875
-  There we go.
-  Can you manage OK?

00:58.875 --> 01:00.958
-  Grab that one?
-  I can manage this one.

01:00.958 --> 01:02.292
Oh, that's a heavy one!

01:02.292 --> 01:05.125
 If you just follow me,
we'll go find your new homes.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.125
 Bring your bags.
We'll help you down.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.250
That's a bit heavy,
that one.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.333
-  Hey? Your jacket.
-  Can you manage?

01:17.333 --> 01:18.417
Gosh. Here we go.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.000
OK, guys,
we're gonna go...

01:20.000 --> 01:22.500
Diala's family, we're
gonna take you to your home.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.583
Bring that out the way.

01:24.583 --> 01:27.500
If you get your bags,
we can give you a hand.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.042
Where the fuck
are they from?

01:29.042 --> 01:30.417
Mind your language, sir.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.875
Answer me question.
Who the fuck are they?

01:32.875 --> 01:35.042
-  They're from Syria.
-  From Syria?

01:35.042 --> 01:36.708
Are you taking
the fucking piss?

01:36.708 --> 01:38.875
-  More Muslims.
-  Mind your language.

01:38.875 --> 01:40.458
There's kids here.
Let's keep it calm.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.333
I've got me own kids
to fucking worry about.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.000
I understand,
but let's keep it calm

01:44.000 --> 01:45.542
till we get these kids
in their homes.

01:45.542 --> 01:47.000
It's not fair. It's shit.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.958
I'll answer
all your questions later,

01:48.958 --> 01:50.417
but let's please get
these kids in.

01:50.417 --> 01:52.792
-  You all right?
-  No. No, not at all.

01:52.792 --> 01:54.458
Yeah. Yeah.

01:54.458 --> 01:56.583
Why didn't you tell us
these were coming?

01:56.583 --> 01:59.000
The council will explain
to all the neighbours.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.333
You're gonna explain?

02:00.333 --> 02:02.833
You didn't tell us they were
coming! When you gonna do that?

02:02.833 --> 02:03.958
We'll be around...

02:03.958 --> 02:05.583
But they've got a good point.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.667
You've gotta admit
they've a good point.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.375
But listen,
there's bairns on the bus.

02:09.375 --> 02:11.458
- They're tired, frightened.
-  Laura...

02:11.458 --> 02:13.833
We need to get them in.
We'll deal with it later.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.333
How many more busfuls?

02:15.333 --> 02:17.292
We'll just
have to deal with it later.

02:17.292 --> 02:19.500
You fucking ragheads, man!

02:19.500 --> 02:21.042
You shot my mate in Iraq!

02:21.042 --> 02:22.875
All right,
that's out of order, now.

02:22.875 --> 02:25.167
- We need to keep calm.
-  That is out of order!

02:25.167 --> 02:27.208
She's taking
your fucking photo there!

02:27.208 --> 02:29.208
- Look at her! Her, there! Look!
-  What?

02:29.208 --> 02:31.542
She's taking
your fucking photo!

02:31.542 --> 02:34.250
Taking my photo
without my say-so?

02:34.250 --> 02:36.792
- It's a fucking disgrace, TJ!
-  She's a bairn. Howay.

02:38.042 --> 02:39.750
You better delete that photo,
right now!

02:39.750 --> 02:40.875
Rocco, howay.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.708
-  Delete that now!

02:42.708 --> 02:44.708
That's my picture!
Delete it!

02:44.708 --> 02:46.750
The size of youse, man!
You're terrifying them.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.417
Mate, she's taken my photo!

02:48.417 --> 02:50.125
- You can't do that!
- Look, right...

02:50.125 --> 02:52.375
Can you manage? Watch your step
as you're coming off.

02:52.375 --> 02:55.500
Try and stay together.
Quickly, lads.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.917
Quickly, lads. This way.

02:56.917 --> 02:58.625
I'll sort out the photograph, right?

02:58.625 --> 03:01.333
I'll sort the photograph, right?
But they're just kids, man.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.458
Let them get in their house
and get settled, man.

03:10.292 --> 03:12.042
- Smile, boys!

03:12.042 --> 03:14.625
Ooh! Belter!
Right, come on, ladies!

03:14.625 --> 03:17.083
Give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.208
- Right, OK.
- Please!

03:18.208 --> 03:19.458
- Two more pictures.
- Please!

03:19.458 --> 03:23.708
Rocco, man. Rocco, man.
Nah, man. Rocco. Rocco, man.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.500
- Please. Give me the camera.
-  Rocco.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.833
- Give it her back.
- The camera.

03:26.833 --> 03:29.208
- Stop messing.
- Right, selfie!

03:29.208 --> 03:30.500
Please, my camera.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.667
You better step back,
wee man.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.583
-  Rocco.
-  She tried to grab it!

03:37.583 --> 03:39.292
She shouldn't've tried
to grab it!

03:39.292 --> 03:41.750
-  Rocco, man, what the...
-  Wind your neck in.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.958
We'll deal with it
once we get inside.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.542
- It's all right.
-  It was a joke, man!

03:46.542 --> 03:48.500
- Come on.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.792
Rocco, that's...

03:50.792 --> 03:52.125
Let's go inside.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.083
 OK. Everybody in?

04:04.083 --> 04:05.167
OK.

04:08.042 --> 04:09.333
-  I'm sorry.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.083
I'm really sorry for that, guys.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.833
OK, you've got your lounge here.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.041
You've got your lounge.

04:16.041 --> 04:19.166
Here. Here's your bags.

04:19.166 --> 04:20.708
I'm really sorry that happened

04:20.708 --> 04:22.000
and I hope you're OK.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.750
Shukran.

04:23.750 --> 04:27.083
 OK.
So we got a microwave.

04:29.125 --> 04:30.833
We've got a fridge
in the corner.

04:31.583 --> 04:33.833
We've got the most important
thing, a kettle, here.

04:38.583 --> 04:39.917
OK. Everybody OK?

04:46.042 --> 04:48.667
 Come on!

04:48.667 --> 04:49.875
Marra!

04:51.208 --> 04:52.833
Come on! Good girl!

04:52.833 --> 04:54.167
Good girl, Marra.

04:54.792 --> 04:56.500
Right, leave. Ah! Hey!

04:57.458 --> 04:58.458
Leave it.

05:07.625 --> 05:08.875
Come on!

05:13.083 --> 05:15.375
Come on! Come on, Marra!

05:17.958 --> 05:19.167
Marra, leave it.

05:20.167 --> 05:23.042
Hey! Leave it.
Come on. Leave it.

05:23.042 --> 05:24.125
Leave it!

05:42.875 --> 05:44.917
Good girl, Marra. Good girl.

05:44.917 --> 05:46.292
Go on, off you get.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.583
Good girl, Marra.

06:07.583 --> 06:09.542
Come on. Give you some water.

06:18.292 --> 06:20.167
Come on. Good girl. Good girl.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.125
There you go.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.667
Good girl.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.750
Fuck's sake, man.

06:54.417 --> 06:56.083
Ah, fuck's sake!

07:24.458 --> 07:26.042
Just put your mum in the car, Michelle.

07:26.042 --> 07:27.417
I'm gonna have a word
with that lad.

07:27.417 --> 07:30.208
- Dad, settle down.
- Just put her in the car.

07:39.958 --> 07:42.708
Oh, son,
have you sold that house?

07:42.708 --> 07:45.042
That's commercially
sensitive information, sir.

07:45.042 --> 07:48.167
Look, I'll give you sensitive.
Have you sold it or not?

07:48.167 --> 07:50.417
It was sold online at auction
a couple of weeks ago,

07:50.417 --> 07:52.458
along with three others
at the top of the village.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.542
What, four houses
without even a visit?

07:54.542 --> 07:56.125
Who the fuck bought them, like?

07:56.125 --> 07:59.000
I don't know.
Some company in Cyprus.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.833
- How much?
- Eight grand each.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.167
Fuck me, I am screwed!

08:04.167 --> 08:06.042
We paid five times that
for ours!

08:06.042 --> 08:09.625
How the fuck
am I gonna sell it now, eh?

08:09.625 --> 08:12.000
Have you got a tenant? Have
you done a background check?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.250
None of that's my department.

08:13.250 --> 08:16.250
"Not my department."
I'll "not my department" you!

08:16.250 --> 08:18.167
You rented out the house
next door to me

08:18.167 --> 08:19.958
to a fucking nutter!

08:20.500 --> 08:24.583
They've been bought online,
right, on an auction.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.875
They've never been to the
village to look at the houses.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.542
They've never walked
round the street,

08:28.542 --> 08:30.417
our streets, in our village,
you know.

08:31.750 --> 08:33.750
Bought by some speculating
greedy bastard

08:33.750 --> 08:35.832
who'll rent them out
to some fucking moron.

08:35.832 --> 08:38.332
- They're fucking parasites.
- They are.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.875
All they do... They don't
even come to the village,

08:40.875 --> 08:42.167
they don't come to the street,

08:42.167 --> 08:44.125
don't see the fucking
houses they're buying.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.625
Now, you heard this?

08:45.625 --> 08:49.375
They're advertising homes
for rent in my street, right,

08:49.375 --> 08:50.667
in Durham fucking prison.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.500
- I'm not kidding you!

08:52.500 --> 08:55.708
They're shitting on me, man.
Shitting on me, I tell you.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.583
Seriously? Durham fucking jail?

08:57.583 --> 09:01.125
Remember a few years ago,
when Mary was first diagnosed,

09:01.125 --> 09:03.542
and we were thinking about
selling up and moving

09:03.542 --> 09:05.750
so we could be closer
to her sister?

09:05.750 --> 09:07.417
- Yeah.
- Aye, I remember that.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.125
We hummed and hawed for a bit,
like, didn't know what to do.

09:10.125 --> 09:13.042
But we got the house valued.
It was worth about 50 grand.

09:13.042 --> 09:15.000
Bit more than we paid for,
so that was all right.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.375
Do you know how much...

09:16.375 --> 09:18.208
Do you know how much
that company in Cyprus

09:18.208 --> 09:20.458
- paid for them houses?
- Go on.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.875
- Eight grand each.
- Fuck! For fuck's sake!

09:22.875 --> 09:24.792
- I mean, we're screwed.
- Fucking eight grand!

09:24.792 --> 09:26.500
Eight grand!

09:26.500 --> 09:29.000
I mean, Mary cannot take it
anymore, man,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.167
with that dick next door.

09:30.167 --> 09:31.750
But we're just trapped there.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.458
This has now become
a dumping ground, lads.

09:34.458 --> 09:37.542
- You're right.
- And lasses. A dumping ground!

09:37.542 --> 09:39.000
Aye, you're right, there.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.625
Them people
that are buying the places,

09:41.625 --> 09:43.917
they're not bothered,
they're not doing the houses up.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.625
And the people
who are moving in,

09:45.625 --> 09:48.000
well, it's not their property
at the end of the day.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.375
They're not doing them up.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.167
They're just being left
to rack and ruin.

09:51.167 --> 09:53.958
I just don't know what to say.
I mean, me and Mary, we...

09:53.958 --> 09:55.875
we've been in this village
all of our lives.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.375
- I know you have.
- You know?

09:57.375 --> 10:00.625
And is this gonna be it, like?
The rest of our lives, living...

10:00.625 --> 10:02.083
- Oh...
- Howay, man.

10:02.083 --> 10:03.458
I can't take it anymore!

10:03.458 --> 10:05.833
- No, man.
- Come on, marra.

10:05.833 --> 10:08.417
Howay, Charlie. Look, mate,
we're gonna sort this out.

10:08.417 --> 10:10.000
- Give over, man.
- We'll sort this out.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.625
We all know Mary. Please
give her our regards, will ya?

10:12.625 --> 10:14.125
We're all rooting for her.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.333
How is she, Charlie?

10:15.333 --> 10:18.208
At one time, owning
your house was your pride.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.292
It's a fucking millstone now,
though, innit?

10:20.292 --> 10:22.083
A fucking millstone,
you're right.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.667
-  It's not worth nowt.
-  It's what we've become.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.583
Here, she's one of them
from the bus.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.792
Fucking hell. That'll be
a pint of Guinness, then!

10:33.042 --> 10:36.125
Morning. You OK?
Hi, there. How can I help you?

10:36.125 --> 10:39.042
I just came to say thank you for
your kindness when we arrived.

10:39.042 --> 10:41.500
- No need. I didn't do anything.
- I really appreciate it.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.375
No, I didn't do anything.
You're all right.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.250
And I need to ask you
another question.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.958
I am trying to find the man
who broke my camera.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.708
I need him to pay for it
and to fix it.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.125
-  Right.
- Yeah. So do you know him?

10:52.125 --> 10:54.208
No, I don't really know
who it was.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.583
He wore a shirt with
the black and white stripes.

10:56.583 --> 10:58.708
- That cuts it down!
-  That's popular here.

10:58.708 --> 11:01.375
Those are the colours
of a local football team, erm...

11:01.375 --> 11:04.000
Y-Yeah.
But you were talking to him.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.458
Do you remember that?

11:05.458 --> 11:08.667
Yeah, I remember talking to him.
I... I know who he is.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.333
He's not...
he's not a friend of mine.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.417
Erm, listen, I'm not the police.

11:12.417 --> 11:15.167
Maybe if you see him,
can you please let me know?

11:15.167 --> 11:17.375
My name is Yara, by the way.
What's yours?

11:17.375 --> 11:20.000
I'm, erm, Tommy Joe Ballantyne.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.708
Thank you, Mr Ballantyne.
Can you do that?

11:22.708 --> 11:24.792
I'll... I'll see what I can do.
I'll try. Yeah.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.875
Thank you so much,
Mr Ballantyne.

11:26.875 --> 11:27.958
-  OK.
- Bye-bye.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.458
OK. Bye, now.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.625
What a fucking brass neck.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.458
I thought they couldn't
come into the pubs

11:35.458 --> 11:36.542
where they sold alcohol.

11:36.542 --> 11:39.375
Oh, man, they get up to
all sorts when nobody's looking.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.250
I learnt that
when I used to work out there.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.750
She marched in here
as if she owns the place.

11:43.750 --> 11:44.875
What next?

11:44.875 --> 11:46.417
- Building a mosque.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
- Morning.
- Morning.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.125
Youse all right?

11:55.875 --> 11:57.208
Solid ten out of ten, you know.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.125
- Pretty good, yeah.
- You want some?

11:59.125 --> 12:00.667
Ah, I'm still undecided.

12:10.083 --> 12:13.792
- Morning, Linda.
- Oh, morning. Hi!

12:14.625 --> 12:16.292
Should you not be at school?

12:16.292 --> 12:20.292
Yeah, but they could do a day
without me, so... you know.

12:20.292 --> 12:22.375
But don't tell my nan.
I'll get another lecture.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.875
- Stop! Hey! Stop!

12:28.875 --> 12:31.167
Fucking stop!

12:34.333 --> 12:36.667
Jesus Christ, man. Lads,
I nearly fucking shit meself.

12:36.667 --> 12:38.625
TJ, man,
stop overreacting.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.167
They're little soft shits, really.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.542
Overreacting? You can put
a saddle on that fucker!

12:42.542 --> 12:45.000
Let's be fair, TJ. We wouldn't
have them in the street

12:45.000 --> 12:46.333
if they weren't good with kids.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.167
Their bark's worse
than their bite.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.625
-  They're lovely.
- Lovely?

12:49.625 --> 12:51.208
They're not that bad, mate.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.375
They were viewing her
as a bloody breakfast snack!

12:53.375 --> 12:54.625
- They're not bad.
- He's cute.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.042
- We apologise, mate.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.000
Lads... Fucking hell.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.042
Listen to me.
This camera costs so much money.

13:08.042 --> 13:09.125
You need to pay for it.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.042
Well, you shouldn't've
tried to grab it!

13:11.042 --> 13:12.875
You shouldn't take it
from the bag!

13:12.875 --> 13:15.000
You shouldn't have taken
my picture then!

13:15.000 --> 13:17.708
- You should pay for it.
- What's going on?

13:17.708 --> 13:19.333
This is the man
who broke my camera.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.458
What are you banging on about, seriously?

13:21.458 --> 13:23.417
I don't understand
what you are saying.

13:23.417 --> 13:24.583
You should pay for it.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.333
If you don't understand me,

13:26.333 --> 13:28.458
and you don't understand
Queen's English,

13:28.458 --> 13:29.875
fuck off back
to your own country.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.583
You fuck off!
Don't say that to me.

13:31.583 --> 13:32.708
I can speak to you
any way I want.

13:32.708 --> 13:33.792
That's rich coming from you.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.625
You're not exactly
fucking local, are you?

13:35.625 --> 13:37.542
- Are you?
-  Right, I'm off-ski!

13:37.542 --> 13:39.583
Have a good one. Bye!

13:43.667 --> 13:46.458
- So you know him.
- Yeah, I do. Yeah.

13:47.708 --> 13:50.542
You'll not get any money
out of him to fix the camera.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.167
- All his money goes on drink

13:53.167 --> 13:55.375
- Do you have the camera on you?
-  Yeah.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.042
Can I please have a look?

14:03.958 --> 14:05.208
Thank you.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.083
If you've got a moment,

14:10.083 --> 14:11.542
and you'll come to the pub
with me,

14:11.542 --> 14:12.625
I may be able to help you.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.625
-  Now?
- If you've got a moment, yeah.

14:15.625 --> 14:18.500
-  Come on, Marra.

14:21.417 --> 14:22.667
Good girl. Good girl.

14:24.458 --> 14:25.708
Aye, off you go.

14:25.708 --> 14:28.083
Er, Maggie, can I have the keys
to the back room, please?

14:28.083 --> 14:30.125
- The back room?
- Yeah, please.

14:33.708 --> 14:34.708
Thank you.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.542
- Good morning.
- Hiya, pet. You all right?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, thank you.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.125
If you'd just like
to come this way.

14:49.667 --> 14:52.042
You'll have to excuse the mess,
I'm afraid.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.250
It's been locked up
for about 20 years, this room.

15:01.708 --> 15:05.458
Back in the day, it used
to be packed every night.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.792
There used to be a pit
in the village. A coal mine.

15:16.792 --> 15:17.917
Oh.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.417
Every village around here
had their own pit.

15:21.792 --> 15:23.667
They're long gone now,
of course.

15:24.792 --> 15:28.750
A whole way of life,
just gone forever.

16:23.125 --> 16:26.208
Yara, this is what I wanted
to show you.

16:33.958 --> 16:34.958
Oh!

16:34.958 --> 16:37.250
Now, they're not the same
as yours,

16:37.250 --> 16:42.000
but I thought that possibly one
might be of some use to you.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.417
They were my uncle's.

16:46.417 --> 16:48.500
He took most of the photographs
in here.

16:50.250 --> 16:52.875
Well, this one looks
really like my camera.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.000
Thank you for thinking of me.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.208
But my camera is...

16:58.292 --> 17:00.083
special to me.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.625
Right, well,
there's a shop in Durham

17:02.625 --> 17:05.000
where I can get your camera
fixed for you.

17:06.125 --> 17:08.625
Well, thank you,
but erm... I have no money.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.500
Right, well...

17:12.666 --> 17:16.583
What happens if I just trade two
of these cameras in to that shop

17:16.583 --> 17:19.458
and that'll get enough money
to get your camera fixed?

17:19.458 --> 17:21.250
Er, you can trust me with it.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.583
I'll get it fixed and I'll keep
an eye on it, don't worry.

17:25.583 --> 17:27.291
Thank you so much.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.667
I'll look after it, I promise.

17:33.417 --> 17:34.708
Thank you.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.875
Do you mind me asking?

17:37.875 --> 17:41.292
You speak very good English.
Where did you learn?

17:41.292 --> 17:44.083
Because I lived in a camp
for two years

17:44.083 --> 17:47.208
and I volunteered there
to help the foreign nurses,

17:47.208 --> 17:49.167
so they taught me
a lot of English.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.708
- Right.
- Also, in the first month,

17:50.708 --> 17:52.917
I decided that
I am going to learn

17:52.917 --> 17:55.208
20 new words of English
every day.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.458
That's what I did, yeah.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.542
- TJ?
-  Yeah, Maggie?

17:58.542 --> 18:00.542
- I really need to go now.
-  Right.

18:00.542 --> 18:03.333
The regulars are in and there's
two that want serving.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.833
Right, I'll be out.
Cheers, Maggie.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.708
- All right. See you later, pet.
- Cheers now.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.417
I'll leave this with you, right?

18:08.417 --> 18:09.875
-  Mr Ballantyne?
- Yep.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.333
Can I take a look
at the other pictures?

18:12.333 --> 18:14.417
Yeah, course you can.
Take as long as you want.

18:14.417 --> 18:17.625
-  Thank you.
- I shouldn't be too long, OK?

18:23.917 --> 18:27.708
Ah, where have you been?
I'm trying to get served, here!

18:27.708 --> 18:29.125
Five minutes we've been waiting.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.708
- Five minutes...
- Do you want a beer?

18:30.708 --> 18:32.292
- Aye, go on then.
- I'll get these.

18:32.292 --> 18:35.125
- Thank you very much.
- So what's going on, TJ?

18:35.125 --> 18:37.500
-  Not a lot, mate.
- We know she's in there.

18:37.500 --> 18:40.750
Aye, TJ, this is the one place
in the village where we can come

18:40.750 --> 18:43.875
and forget our worries,
just be ourselves, man.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.083
I hope you're not slipping her
a length next door!

18:48.375 --> 18:50.458
That'll be a trip
down memory lane!

18:50.458 --> 18:51.750
Been giving her a sob story

18:51.750 --> 18:54.083
about the poor fucking miners,
have you, TJ?

18:54.083 --> 18:56.083
Our Vic, cut the fucker out now.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.958
Look, we've just come in for
a quiet pint, Archie, all right?

18:58.958 --> 19:02.417
And, TJ, we don't need ragheads
in our boozer, yeah?

19:02.417 --> 19:05.375
Ragheads?
Fucking ragheads, Gary, man?

19:05.375 --> 19:07.167
Speak for yourself, lad.

19:07.167 --> 19:11.125
Anyway, she's doing you no harm
whatso-fucking-ever.

19:11.125 --> 19:13.833
-  Ah, piss off, Joe.
- Fucking hell.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.750
You can tell your father
was a fucking scab,

19:15.750 --> 19:17.542
cos you're turning
just like him.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.542
The only regret my old man had

19:19.542 --> 19:21.583
is that he didn't
return to work earlier.

19:21.583 --> 19:24.750
Aye, he didn't get in
earlier, but he fucking went in.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.583
And five years later, mate,
the pit was fucking shut,

19:27.583 --> 19:30.042
and he was on the scrapheap
like the fucking rest of us.

19:30.042 --> 19:31.417
Exactly!

19:55.458 --> 19:58.667
- Thought you might like a drink.
- Thank you.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.917
"When you eat together,
you stick together."

20:00.917 --> 20:03.542
Yeah.
Me mother always said that.

20:03.542 --> 20:06.833
Yeah. We used to do the same
before we left Syria.

20:06.833 --> 20:09.750
We used to cook together, too,
with our neighbours,

20:09.750 --> 20:13.542
and sleep under the stairs
in case we were bombed.

20:15.208 --> 20:17.417
That's taken during the strike.

20:18.292 --> 20:21.167
I was just a young lad.
I'd just started down the pit.

20:21.167 --> 20:23.375
And the government tried
to starve us back to work,

20:23.375 --> 20:26.167
so we made sure that
we ate together every day.

20:27.208 --> 20:28.917
Yeah. And what's that?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.167
Ah, this is more of the strike.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.667
You didn't wanna be caught
by those bastards.

20:37.708 --> 20:39.000
Yeah.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.583
Oh, they look so strong.

20:43.583 --> 20:47.250
Yeah, we were.
Me father always said,

20:47.250 --> 20:50.792
if the workers realised
the power that they have,

20:50.792 --> 20:53.958
had the confidence to use it,
we could change the world.

20:54.792 --> 20:57.292
But we never did.

21:42.958 --> 21:45.042
-  Hi! Salam alaykum!
-  Mama?

21:45.042 --> 21:47.583
Take it. Yeah?
These for Mama.

21:47.583 --> 21:48.792
- Oh, OK!
-  Yeah.

21:48.792 --> 21:50.417
Salam alaykum.

21:50.417 --> 21:52.125
- This one's clothes.
- Shukran.

21:52.125 --> 21:54.833
This one, yeah?
And this, yeah?

21:54.833 --> 21:57.083
Oh, come. I'll show you.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.083
- You all right with that?
-  Yeah, I've got it.

22:05.125 --> 22:08.125
Hi! Salam alaykum!
Wa alaykumu salam!

22:08.125 --> 22:10.750
How are you doing? Good, good?

22:10.750 --> 22:12.583
- This one's for you!
-  Thank you.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.167
Yeah? No problem.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.500
- Mum say thank you.
- Oh, no problem. No problem.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
- Because Jamila...
- Uh-huh.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.333
- ...kick me in bed.

22:28.333 --> 22:29.750
-  No, Jamila!
- No!

22:29.750 --> 22:30.833
- Yes.
- No!

22:30.833 --> 22:32.167
-  You?
- No.

22:39.417 --> 22:40.667
- See?!

22:50.000 --> 22:51.250
Ta.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.583
Two seconds.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.583
- Oh.
-  You all right?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.917
- You know what?
-  What?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.500
- Summat you'll never learn.
-  What's that, then?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.167
Charity begins at home.

23:09.917 --> 23:11.375
Have you seen what I've got?

23:11.375 --> 23:15.042
It's nappies.
There's a baby. Aye.

23:20.667 --> 23:23.875
-  Salam alaykum.

23:23.875 --> 23:26.167
-  You all right? Eh?
- Salaam.

23:26.167 --> 23:27.833
-  I've got some clothes.
- Oh!

23:27.833 --> 23:29.625
-  A couple of shoes.
- Thank you!

23:29.625 --> 23:30.958
- Can I put it inside?

23:30.958 --> 23:32.833
Yes! Shoes!

23:33.833 --> 23:35.000
A couple of bits here.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.208
- Oh! Thanks!
-  Yeah.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.542
That good!

23:39.458 --> 23:41.125
That Aisha's dead canny,
you know.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.500
But they're having, like,
a proper nightmare.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.417
The bairn won't stop crying
cos of his bad chest.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.042
- And that neighbour you saw?
-  Aye.

23:48.042 --> 23:51.167
Banging on the wall constantly,
swearing his head off at them.

23:51.167 --> 23:53.375
It's a nightmare.
Really, really stressful, like.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.750
I can't say I'm surprised.

23:54.750 --> 23:57.167
If you hear the stuff they
come out with in the pub, man.

23:57.167 --> 23:59.375
Jesus! Especially
when they've had a few.

23:59.375 --> 24:01.833
Yeah. And then they go home,
they go online,

24:01.833 --> 24:03.750
and they just
wind each other up.

24:03.750 --> 24:06.792
Some of the stuff they
come out with, it's horrendous.

24:06.792 --> 24:09.083
Well, what do you say
to them in the pub?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.375
What <i>can</i> I say?

24:11.375 --> 24:14.750
Well, I don't know, TJ.
That's why I'm asking you.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.708
I say nowt.
Just keep me mouth shut.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.917
-  Here.
- Ta, thank you.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.083
Erm...

24:37.667 --> 24:39.083
- Laura] Hi!
- Salam alaykum.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.708
Salam alaykum. Salam alaykum.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.792
For you, for the house.
How are you doing?

24:43.792 --> 24:46.333
- Shukran.
- Yeah. No problem.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.125
And for you,
guess what we've got.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.917
- What?
- Bike!

24:49.917 --> 24:51.750
- Yes!

24:53.875 --> 24:56.500
- There you go! Happy?
-  Yeah.

24:58.167 --> 24:59.542
-  There you go!

24:59.542 --> 25:00.833
Yes!

25:02.083 --> 25:03.583
Go, Rana!

25:05.250 --> 25:06.417
All right, lads?

25:06.417 --> 25:08.583
How come they're getting
all that stuff?

25:08.583 --> 25:10.542
It's all been donated
by local people.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.167
It's all second-hand stuff,
lads. There's nothing new.

25:13.167 --> 25:15.542
I know, but they've
been getting everything lately.

25:15.542 --> 25:17.125
Aye,
but they've lost everything.

25:17.125 --> 25:18.833
That's what
you've gotta understand.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.042
They came to this country
and had absolutely nothing

25:21.042 --> 25:22.625
other than the clothes
on their back.

25:22.625 --> 25:24.583
Wish I could get a bike.

25:27.250 --> 25:30.500
You know, maybe you <i>should</i>
do something for the local kids.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.708
Are you kidding us?
Why don't <i>you</i> do something?

25:33.708 --> 25:37.917
Start the football up again!
No?! Thought not.

25:37.917 --> 25:41.208
Hey, man, I'm ran off me feet.
I never stop.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.125
I've got bairns at home.
I've got work.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.083
Me mam's poorly. Our lad's
saying he never sees us.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.917
You want us to do more?

25:47.917 --> 25:49.917
There's only a couple of us
doing this, you know.

25:49.917 --> 25:51.667
Me, a couple from the church...

25:53.958 --> 25:56.542
Jesus Christ, man, TJ.
<i>You</i> do something.

25:56.542 --> 25:58.375
For fuck's sake.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.167
You used to be the one
kicking <i>our</i> arses

26:00.167 --> 26:02.125
when something
needed doing round here.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.667
And now what? I've gotta beg you
to give us a lift in the van

26:05.667 --> 26:06.833
to drop some stuff off?!

26:06.833 --> 26:08.917
Are you kidding us?
Howay, man!

26:12.500 --> 26:15.542
On your marks, get set.

26:33.208 --> 26:39.458
Olivia! Go on, Olivia!
Go on, Olivia!

26:39.458 --> 26:41.125
Go on, Olivia!

26:48.875 --> 26:50.208
Olivia!

27:01.750 --> 27:03.417
Keep going, Linda!

27:04.000 --> 27:06.708
Go, go, go, go, go!
Keep going, Linda!

27:09.500 --> 27:11.167
Linda! Linda!

27:15.917 --> 27:17.042
Linda, are you OK?

27:18.083 --> 27:20.542
-  I feel ill.
- Is your mother here?

27:20.542 --> 27:22.292
No, she's at work.

27:22.292 --> 27:25.000
Linda.
Linda, you all right, darling?

27:25.000 --> 27:26.250
No.

27:26.250 --> 27:29.583
Here, have some water.
You might be dehydrated.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.375
- Here.
- Thank you.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.500
What have you eaten
today, Linda?

27:34.750 --> 27:37.542
Erm, just a small bag of crisps.

27:37.542 --> 27:40.708
Right, OK. Do you think
you might want to go home?

27:40.708 --> 27:42.250
- Erm... yeah.
- Yep.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.833
Is your home near?

27:43.833 --> 27:45.667
It's just a couple
of streets away.

27:45.667 --> 27:48.208
- OK, I can take you home.
-  Oh, yeah?

28:04.333 --> 28:06.625
Oh, I forgot my keys.

28:19.083 --> 28:20.125
Max?

28:20.875 --> 28:23.042
Max, open the door.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.000
What do you want?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.750
Hi. Your sister
is not feeling well.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.917
- Can I help her inside?
- Yeah, sure.

28:38.167 --> 28:39.167
Come, sit here.

28:42.792 --> 28:44.125
Put your head here.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.750
I have a banana
in my bag.

28:54.750 --> 28:56.542
Could you try and eat that?

28:56.542 --> 29:00.167
I can't. I need summat sweet.
That usually helps.

29:02.167 --> 29:03.750
Sorry, do you have a biscuit

29:03.750 --> 29:05.958
or something sweet
for your sister?

29:09.042 --> 29:10.500
One moment.

29:49.958 --> 29:52.083
Who the fuck are you?!

29:52.833 --> 29:53.833
I'm sorry, I...

29:53.833 --> 29:56.917
Do I come in <i>your</i> house, poking
around in your fucking fridge?

29:56.917 --> 30:01.417
- Get out! Fucking get out!
-  You don't understand...

30:01.417 --> 30:02.583
-  Get out!
- Don't!

30:02.583 --> 30:04.042
I'm sorry,
I was trying to help...

30:04.042 --> 30:06.500
Keep your... These kids
are <i>my</i> responsibility.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.875
Keep your big fucking foreign
nose out my business, right?

30:09.875 --> 30:11.625
- Get out!
-  She was helping me!

30:11.625 --> 30:14.167
I don't fucking care!
You're not wanted here.

30:14.167 --> 30:16.500
You don't understand!
She's sick! I was helping her!

30:16.500 --> 30:18.458
I don't fucking care! Get out!

30:18.458 --> 30:19.875
And don't come back!

30:22.375 --> 30:25.042
What the fuck do
you think youse two are doing?

30:25.042 --> 30:26.917
- Eh?
-  It wasn't me, it was her.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.667
How many times
have I told you

30:28.667 --> 30:30.667
not to let strangers
in the house?

30:30.667 --> 30:32.792
Fucking foreigners in me house!

30:32.792 --> 30:34.750
- How many times?
-  I was ill!

30:34.750 --> 30:37.167
I'm gonna take the key
off you, I swear to God!

30:47.500 --> 30:49.000
- Mr Ballantyne?
- Hello, Yara.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.375
- Hi.
- I have something for you.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.083
- Thank you so much.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.333
-  You're welcome.

31:04.917 --> 31:07.125
- Shukran.
- Thank you, Mr Ballantyne.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.500
My mum say
you must come in for tea.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.042
Oh, no, it's OK. I've got dirty
shoes on. I've been to work.

31:13.042 --> 31:14.875
No, please!
Please, just for tea!

31:14.875 --> 31:16.417
Five minutes. Please, come.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.625
- Well, that's very kind of you.
-  Please, come.

31:18.625 --> 31:19.750
Thank you.

31:42.125 --> 31:44.125
She's, er...
She's making a joke of me.

31:44.125 --> 31:45.875
Like, now I am going
to take pictures

31:45.875 --> 31:48.750
of everyone on the street,
like I did in the camp.

31:48.750 --> 31:50.792
Oh, right.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.917
Thank you.

31:56.458 --> 31:57.792
Shukran.

32:00.000 --> 32:03.083
- Here, have some cakes.
-  Thank you.

32:05.750 --> 32:07.042
Do you like it?

32:07.667 --> 32:10.625
Very good cake. Very nice.

32:13.833 --> 32:15.333
Is the camera OK?

32:15.333 --> 32:18.000
It's perfect. Like a new one.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.500
Shukran.

32:21.042 --> 32:22.833
Do you know
what "shukran" means?

32:22.833 --> 32:25.167
-  No.
- It means "thank you".

32:25.167 --> 32:26.500
-  Shukran.
- Shukran.

32:26.500 --> 32:29.917
It goes with your name.
"Shukran, Mr Ballantyne."

32:29.917 --> 32:33.125
- Well, shukran.

32:36.083 --> 32:37.917
So, all the kids
are in school now.

32:37.917 --> 32:39.417
So how's it going?

32:41.417 --> 32:42.542
-  Good.
- Good?

32:42.542 --> 32:43.833
-  Yeah.
- School? Good?

32:43.833 --> 32:45.708
Good, good. Yes.

32:45.708 --> 32:47.708
Big lad, how's school going?

32:50.625 --> 32:52.708
- Good, good.
-  Good. Right.

32:55.583 --> 32:57.583
Your dolls are very pretty.

33:05.667 --> 33:08.667
-  Do they have names?

33:08.667 --> 33:10.625
Erm...

33:12.250 --> 33:14.000
Erm, yeah.

33:14.000 --> 33:20.250
Erm... Rahat. Rahat, Rafif,
Sham, Shahad, Amara.

33:23.917 --> 33:27.375
So those are the names
of her girlfriends back home.

33:27.375 --> 33:29.792
She doesn't know
where they are now.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.625
This is our father,

33:41.625 --> 33:45.583
and she said she wish
he can find us here.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.417
-  I'm sure he will.

33:49.417 --> 33:50.958
Yeah, I'm sure he will.

34:03.125 --> 34:04.625
If you'll excuse them,

34:04.625 --> 34:06.542
- they have homework to do.
-  Yeah.

34:08.875 --> 34:11.083
- So this is my father.
-  Yeah.

34:11.083 --> 34:15.583
He's a tailor.
Quick hands and quick mind.

34:16.917 --> 34:19.250
His only crime
was to look for his brother.

34:21.875 --> 34:25.292
He was picked up by the shabiha.
It means "the ghosts".

34:25.292 --> 34:27.167
Ghosts?

34:27.167 --> 34:30.708
They are state-sponsored
militias of the Syrian regime.

34:32.292 --> 34:35.792
My mother thinks he's dead.

34:35.792 --> 34:37.625
But I know he's still alive.

34:39.625 --> 34:41.792
Your father got you that camera,
didn't he?

34:41.792 --> 34:42.917
Yeah.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.000
When I was a little girl,

34:47.000 --> 34:49.167
I told him I wanted
to be a photographer

34:49.167 --> 34:51.917
and travel the world.

34:51.917 --> 34:53.000
So...

34:54.542 --> 34:56.917
This camera saved my life.

34:56.917 --> 34:58.250
How's that?

34:59.667 --> 35:02.083
Because I saw a lot of things I...

35:03.000 --> 35:04.708
I wish I hadn't see.

35:04.708 --> 35:07.333
Don't have the words
to describe them.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.667
But when I look through
this camera, I...

35:10.667 --> 35:13.917
I choose to see some hope
and some strength.

35:15.833 --> 35:18.250
So I choose how I live
with this camera.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.708
Right.

35:19.708 --> 35:23.375
And I feel like...
like my father is with me.

35:24.708 --> 35:26.625
So thank you for fixing it.

35:29.167 --> 35:30.792
It's my pleasure.

35:35.792 --> 35:37.042
Go on! Get him!

35:37.042 --> 35:38.333
Hey, Bashir!

35:38.333 --> 35:40.792
Get him down. Give him what
he deserves! Make him pay!

35:40.792 --> 35:43.708
- Go on!

35:43.708 --> 35:45.917
-  Right, boys, go on!

35:45.917 --> 35:47.875
-  Go on, give him it!

35:51.750 --> 35:53.333
All right, boys, go on!

35:55.750 --> 35:58.167
Get the fuck off the Paki cunt!
Let me speak to him.

35:58.167 --> 35:59.250
Get the fuck off him now.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.333
- You, you little bastard, eh?
-  Go on!

36:01.333 --> 36:03.250
Eh? Fucking look at me, yeah?

36:03.250 --> 36:05.542
I know what you've fucking done,
you know what you...

36:05.542 --> 36:08.000
Get the fuck off! We all know
what you've fucking done!

36:08.000 --> 36:10.458
Why the fuck would you do that?!
Eh?

36:10.458 --> 36:12.333
- Get the fuck up.
-  Get him up!

36:12.333 --> 36:14.042
You, you little bastard!
Fuck off!

36:14.042 --> 36:15.333
You dirty immigrant cunt!

36:15.333 --> 36:17.000
Fuck off
back to your own country!

36:17.000 --> 36:19.167
Fucking do that again,
I swear to fucking God...

36:19.167 --> 36:20.708
- Go on!
- Go!

36:20.708 --> 36:22.792
You fucking little
dirty Paki cunt!

36:22.792 --> 36:24.833
Go on! Well, bloody go on!

36:24.833 --> 36:27.667
Fucking wanker. Wanker,
that's what you fucking are!

36:28.292 --> 36:31.167
<i>Get the fuck
off him now. Get the fuck up.</i>

36:31.167 --> 36:32.417
<i>You, you little cunt.</i>

36:32.417 --> 36:34.292
<i>I know
what you've fucking done...</i>

36:34.292 --> 36:37.000
- Stop it there! Stop it there.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.708
Look, see him?
That's my nephew, right?

36:39.708 --> 36:41.042
Listen to what he says.

36:41.042 --> 36:43.625
"You know what you've done,
we know what you've done."

36:43.625 --> 36:44.917
Have you seen this, Charlie?

36:52.667 --> 36:55.125
See, that foreign bastard,

36:55.125 --> 36:57.125
he's been bullying lasses
at dinner time.

36:57.125 --> 37:00.083
He pushed one over.
Yeah! Ask the parents.

37:01.083 --> 37:02.208
I know the lad.

37:03.583 --> 37:05.333
He's a good kid,
he's a decent lad.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.667
We're just trying to figure out
what happened.

37:08.667 --> 37:10.375
Well, summat's gone on, TJ.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.333
Here, Gary, play that again.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.250
<i>Fucking go now!</i>

37:22.250 --> 37:24.917
<i>- Go. Fuck off!</i>
-  <i>Go on!</i>

37:24.917 --> 37:26.958
<i>That's what happens
to bullies in our school.</i>

37:26.958 --> 37:28.792
See? Something
happened before that.

37:28.792 --> 37:31.083
Aye, that's your Ronnie
responding, innit?

37:31.083 --> 37:33.875
Our Ronnie's getting bullied
on fucking social media now.

37:33.875 --> 37:36.000
They're bloody fanatics, man.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.000
So what the fuck do you
make of that then, TJ?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.250
I dunno.

37:41.250 --> 37:43.792
-  Another pint? Anybody?
-  That all you can say?

37:43.792 --> 37:46.083
I'll force another one.
Cheers, Eddy.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.958
That's all you can say,
"Another pint?"

37:47.958 --> 37:49.042
Hm-hmm!

37:49.042 --> 37:50.917
- I better have your bitter.
- Cheers.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.250
Right you are, mate.

37:52.250 --> 37:53.667
-  Cheers.
-  Cheers.

37:53.667 --> 37:56.125
I mean, I'm no racist,

37:56.125 --> 37:58.000
but I'm not happy
about the school.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.458
All those extra kids in there.

38:00.458 --> 38:02.000
And I don't blame them,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
but some of them
don't even speak English!

38:04.000 --> 38:05.208
It's holding everyone back.

38:05.208 --> 38:07.375
Exactly!
Are there no more teachers?

38:07.375 --> 38:10.458
Aye, they're bringing
someone in who speaks Arabic.

38:10.458 --> 38:13.333
Arabic? That's great
for our kids, that, innit?

38:13.333 --> 38:16.000
There was two of them in front
of my cousin in the doctor's

38:16.000 --> 38:17.625
trying to fill
fucking forms out.

38:17.625 --> 38:18.708
That took half an hour.

38:18.708 --> 38:20.917
It was the same with Mary
at the health centre.

38:20.917 --> 38:23.333
Funny, innit?
They always put 'em round here,

38:23.333 --> 38:25.458
but never put 'em in Chelsea
or fucking Westminster!

38:25.458 --> 38:28.208
Of course they don't! They
don't want them living by them.

38:28.208 --> 38:31.250
That's why they're dumping them
on us by the fucking busload.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.917
I mean, I'm not against
refugees, immigrants.

38:33.917 --> 38:36.083
I mean, God,
my father was Irish.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.125
But there's fuck all
in this village now.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.375
And we're supposed to share it
with that lot?

38:40.375 --> 38:41.500
We don't even know them.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.083
And if you say anything
about it,

38:43.083 --> 38:45.250
all the posh wankers
make you out to be a racist.

38:45.250 --> 38:47.708
- I'm fucking sick of it.
-  So am I. I'm sick of it.

38:47.708 --> 38:49.375
What about
the background checks?

38:49.375 --> 38:51.542
You know what I mean?
Who are these people's wives?

38:51.542 --> 38:53.958
Who are they married to?
Who's their brothers? Cousins?

38:53.958 --> 38:55.917
They've all got smartphones.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.875
Face to face with fighters
in a war zone.

38:57.875 --> 39:00.458
All it takes is one of them
to slip through.

39:00.458 --> 39:02.458
One crazy fucking jihadi.

39:02.458 --> 39:05.833
I feel sorry for the poor
bastards. I honestly do.

39:05.833 --> 39:08.333
Well, me an' all, Jaffa,
but what can we do?

39:08.333 --> 39:09.792
We can't even
look after our own.

39:09.792 --> 39:13.000
Bang on! People living in
fucking boarded-up houses, eh,

39:13.000 --> 39:14.083
with candles on?

39:14.083 --> 39:16.750
They've never had any fucking
respect for us round here, ever.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.917
Well, I say we should
draw a line in the sand, eh?

39:19.917 --> 39:22.625
Enough's enough.
It starts here, this village.

39:22.625 --> 39:25.667
This pub, The Old Oak.
We should have a public meeting

39:25.667 --> 39:27.458
and tell everybody
how we're feeling.

39:27.458 --> 39:28.583
Invite everybody.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.750
The local council, the press,
Tyne Tees telly.

39:31.750 --> 39:35.042
You need to be careful, Charlie.
You get a load of racists in.

39:35.042 --> 39:37.125
There's plenty of them about.
We don't need it!

39:37.125 --> 39:39.000
Jaffa,
as far as I'm concerned,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.917
it's now or never.

39:40.917 --> 39:44.000
Where would we hold it?
Everywhere's closed.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.708
There's the church hall,

39:45.708 --> 39:48.000
the miners' welfare,
even the school's gone!

39:48.000 --> 39:50.500
Well, you opened the back
room the other day there, TJ.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.042
- We could have it in there.
- Aye.

39:52.042 --> 39:53.500
It's been shut for 20 years.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.083
The place is an absolute tip.

39:55.083 --> 39:57.375
We could help you
clean it up, couldn't we, lads?

39:57.375 --> 39:59.083
- Do that, aye.
- Yeah, course we could!

39:59.083 --> 40:01.167
There's nay heating,
the plumbing's knackered,

40:01.167 --> 40:03.542
and the electrics are fucked.
That's a non-starter.

40:03.542 --> 40:06.125
Jaffa's done time
in the building trade.

40:06.125 --> 40:07.500
Couldn't you help out, Jaffa?

40:07.500 --> 40:09.750
No, count me out.
I've got a bad back.

40:09.750 --> 40:12.542
-  Fucking lazy bastard!

40:12.542 --> 40:14.167
What about the cookers, TJ?

40:14.167 --> 40:15.458
-  Cookers?
- Aye.

40:15.458 --> 40:17.500
They haven't worked
since the '90s, man.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.042
We'd blow ourselves up
using them.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.458
I'll strip them down.
I've got time.

40:20.458 --> 40:22.208
Oh, anyway,
we don't need cookers.

40:22.208 --> 40:23.667
We don't need any food or nowt.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.917
All we need is a room
for a few hours for a meeting.

40:25.917 --> 40:27.250
Now what's the problem?

40:28.083 --> 40:30.000
I haven't got
public liability insurance.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.125
So I can't have
any public functions in there.

40:32.125 --> 40:35.208
You're a stickler
for the rules all of a sudden!

40:35.208 --> 40:37.000
Do you mind if I go
and have a look meself?

40:37.000 --> 40:38.458
Go on, Charlie.
Go on, son.

40:38.458 --> 40:41.208
Hey, the keys are behind
the bar. Come on, open it up.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.042
The room stays closed.

40:47.583 --> 40:50.333
Hey, do you know
what it is, TJ?

40:50.333 --> 40:52.917
Some of us have been drinking
in this pub for 40 years.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.167
That's a lifetime, man.

40:54.167 --> 40:58.125
Me and Mary, we had our
engagement party in that room.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.667
You were there,
you remember?

40:59.667 --> 41:01.542
- Course I can, mate.
- Aye, course you can.

41:01.542 --> 41:03.417
Cos you made a lovely speech,
didn't you?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.500
-"Marras for life" and all that.
- Aye.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.625
And now you won't
even open the room for us,

41:07.625 --> 41:09.292
but you'll open it
for your new mates?

41:09.292 --> 41:11.333
What's that? Do we not count
all of a sudden?

41:11.333 --> 41:13.167
Aye.

41:13.167 --> 41:17.875
I'm sorry, mate. I'm sorry.
But that room stays shut.

41:17.875 --> 41:20.208
-  Howay, then.

41:20.208 --> 41:22.708
Aye, fair enough.
Fair enough.

41:22.708 --> 41:24.917
-  Sorry, Charlie.
-  Fucking disgraceful.

41:24.917 --> 41:26.792
- Sit down, Charlie.
- He's changed.

41:26.792 --> 41:28.292
Absolutely.

41:47.208 --> 41:48.917
Can I have a word with you?

41:49.750 --> 41:52.875
Nadia...

41:52.875 --> 41:55.333
Yeah, you!
I need to talk to you.

42:01.542 --> 42:04.000
I didn't know what happened
with Linda the other day.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.167
I'm really sorry.

42:05.167 --> 42:07.667
I just wanted to apologise.

42:07.667 --> 42:09.875
I'm sorry too,
for entering your house.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.250
I should have asked.

42:11.250 --> 42:14.792
You know, Linda showed me
the photographs you took of her.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.875
They're really lovely.
They're so natural.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.042
And she looks happy
for a change.

42:21.792 --> 42:23.042
What I wanted to ask you,

42:23.042 --> 42:25.542
I showed the pictures
to the girls in the salon.

42:25.542 --> 42:27.625
I've got a little
cleaning job there,

42:27.625 --> 42:30.417
just a few hours a week.
They would really like it

42:30.417 --> 42:32.708
if you come and took some
pictures of them, as well.

42:32.708 --> 42:35.000
Really?
Yeah, I can do that. Yeah.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.250
-  Just be careful.
- Yeah.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.792
Can you look at the camera, please?

42:41.792 --> 42:44.167
- You want us to look at you?
- Yeah. Look here.

42:46.708 --> 42:49.292
So this is Debbie. Yara.

43:06.167 --> 43:08.000
Are you enjoying
doing this, then?

43:08.000 --> 43:09.875
Yeah, very much.

43:09.875 --> 43:12.417
Thank you for letting me
take your photos.

43:12.417 --> 43:13.750
Ah, you're welcome.

43:14.667 --> 43:17.375
- Oh, nice cup of tea.
- There you go.

43:17.375 --> 43:18.875
Oh, that's fantastic, thank you.

43:18.875 --> 43:20.000
There you are, Yara.

43:20.000 --> 43:21.708
- Thank you.
- Nice brew for you, darling.

43:21.708 --> 43:23.625
- So how's Linda?
- Yeah, she's good!

43:23.625 --> 43:24.708
She's doing better.

43:24.708 --> 43:26.042
- Yeah?
- She's back at school.

43:26.042 --> 43:27.542
Nice and hot.

43:27.542 --> 43:29.458
- Can I just ask you something?
- Yeah.

43:29.458 --> 43:32.667
Do you do, erm...
like, a gift voucher?

43:32.667 --> 43:34.208
Ah. No, Sadie.

43:34.208 --> 43:35.958
We're, like,
a simple outfit, so...

43:35.958 --> 43:37.250
Oh, do you not?

43:38.042 --> 43:39.708
It's just, you know
me daughter Josie?

43:39.708 --> 43:41.500
- Hm-hmm.
- It's her birthday coming up.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.792
- She hasn't been out for months.
- Right.

43:43.792 --> 43:47.000
I was just thinking it would be
lovely, maybe, for her to...

43:47.000 --> 43:49.708
She could do with
having her hair done and...

43:49.708 --> 43:52.792
I mean, she's got her nails,
but, oh, they're a mess.

43:52.792 --> 43:54.458
They really need doing!

43:54.458 --> 43:57.000
And, you know, if I give her
money to get it done,

43:57.000 --> 43:58.958
it'll go straight out
for the kids.

43:58.958 --> 44:00.042
Yeah.

44:00.042 --> 44:02.958
I've got a friend going through
exactly the same thing, Sadie.

44:02.958 --> 44:04.042
It's awful.

44:04.042 --> 44:06.333
She lost all of her confidence.
She's just hiding away.

44:06.333 --> 44:07.875
- Yeah.
- We just never see her.

44:07.875 --> 44:10.500
She's just so lonely.
It really breaks my heart.

44:10.500 --> 44:13.000
And they feel
ashamed, don't they?

44:13.000 --> 44:15.042
That's what happened
to my Katie.

44:15.042 --> 44:17.458
She just got left
by the wayside.

44:17.458 --> 44:18.542
Oh!

44:18.542 --> 44:21.000
I don't even know
where she is.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.417
Don't know
if she'll ever come back.

44:23.417 --> 44:25.083
That's £5.20, there, boy.

44:25.083 --> 44:26.500
- Money's just there.
- Champion.

44:26.500 --> 44:28.125
- Cheers, mate.
- Thanks, TJ.

44:28.125 --> 44:29.958
Got a friend for life,
there, mate!

44:29.958 --> 44:32.250
Ah, she's nay bother!
Canny little dog.

44:32.250 --> 44:33.500
Ah, she's a belter.

44:36.750 --> 44:38.208
-  TJ?
- Yep?

44:38.208 --> 44:39.917
-  Can we have a word?
- Hm-hmm.

44:39.917 --> 44:41.708
Yara and me
have been having a think.

44:41.708 --> 44:44.708
Oh, that's reassuring!

44:44.708 --> 44:46.292
No, not like that,
honestly!

44:46.292 --> 44:49.417
Erm, just, Yara was at the
hairdresser's the other day...

44:49.417 --> 44:51.042
- Right.
- ...talking to the lasses.

44:51.042 --> 44:53.625
And you know what it's like,
people are really struggling.

44:53.625 --> 44:56.875
And she was talking to Sadie
about her daughter, Josie.

44:56.875 --> 44:58.583
Christ, I haven't seen her
in months.

44:58.583 --> 44:59.833
Aye, exactly.

44:59.833 --> 45:02.667
She's, like, really
hiding herself away, right?

45:02.667 --> 45:04.375
I've been thinking,
Mr Ballantyne.

45:04.375 --> 45:07.417
Our families, the Syrian
families, are so isolated,

45:07.417 --> 45:09.000
and worried for their kids.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.042
Some of the locals here
are struggling too.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.417
Ah, I know. Some of the
stories I hear in here, man.

45:13.417 --> 45:15.167
It's absolutely heart-breaking.

45:15.167 --> 45:17.042
Exactly, so...

45:17.042 --> 45:20.667
So that photo, in the backroom.
What your mother said to you.

45:20.667 --> 45:23.042
"If you eat together,
you stick together."

45:23.042 --> 45:24.208
- Right?
- Yeah.

45:24.208 --> 45:27.833
So, imagine if all the families
mix and start to eat together.

45:27.833 --> 45:29.542
We can become friends.

45:29.542 --> 45:32.000
This could really change
our life forever.

45:32.000 --> 45:33.083
What do you think?

45:34.042 --> 45:35.333
Well, sounds like a great idea.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.708
But do you not think
you're taking too much on?

45:37.708 --> 45:41.042
Why, no, man. Our mams did 500
meals a day during the strike.

45:41.042 --> 45:42.125
We can pull off a dinner

45:42.125 --> 45:43.958
for a couple of people
from the village.

45:43.958 --> 45:45.292
If we just start small, maybe,

45:45.292 --> 45:49.000
with the people who need it
the most, like Josie.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.917
And we could maybe
ask Brendan from the school

45:50.917 --> 45:53.292
which of the other bairns
might need it.

45:53.292 --> 45:54.500
Start off like that.

45:55.167 --> 45:58.708
You can borrow the van any time
you want, if that'll help.

45:58.708 --> 46:03.125
The thing is, is there's nowhere
really to do it anymore.

46:03.125 --> 46:05.750
The church hall's gone.

46:05.750 --> 46:07.750
And that was
the last suitable place.

46:07.750 --> 46:10.208
So we were thinking

46:10.208 --> 46:12.458
maybe we could use
the back room?

46:14.583 --> 46:16.625
Are you trying
to embarrass us?

46:16.625 --> 46:17.750
No.

46:17.750 --> 46:19.208
That's been shut up
for 20 years.

46:19.208 --> 46:21.667
We were just thinking
we could get people in...

46:21.667 --> 46:24.042
The plumbing's knackered,
the electric's knackered.

46:24.042 --> 46:26.333
Some of our men
are builders. They can come...

46:26.333 --> 46:29.125
It's not safe, Yara!
You know that.

46:29.125 --> 46:31.917
You know it's not safe in there!
What are you playing at, Laura?

46:31.917 --> 46:33.000
How am I, TJ?

46:33.000 --> 46:34.625
Are you trying
to fucking ruin us?

46:34.625 --> 46:36.917
No, we're trying to do
something for the village!

46:36.917 --> 46:39.000
Even though I could open
that back room,

46:39.000 --> 46:41.667
the last few regulars I've got
left would fucking boycott us.

46:41.667 --> 46:42.833
Oh! Here!

46:42.833 --> 46:45.708
I'm hanging on
by my fingertips here!

46:45.708 --> 46:47.875
I can't sell the place.

46:47.875 --> 46:49.958
I haven't got a penny
to me fucking name!

46:51.083 --> 46:52.792
Do you want us out
on the street?

46:52.792 --> 46:55.833
- No. No, of course not.
- Cos that's what'll happen!

46:57.208 --> 46:59.333
Laura,
just fucking leave it, right?

46:59.333 --> 47:02.250
Just get off me back
and leave it!

47:05.208 --> 47:06.667
Yara, I'm sorry.

47:23.042 --> 47:24.417
Good girl. Come on.

48:12.250 --> 48:13.583
-  Marra!

48:15.125 --> 48:16.125
Leave it!

48:17.042 --> 48:18.042
Marra!

48:21.958 --> 48:24.750
Leave it! Marra, leave it!
Leave it!

48:27.750 --> 48:29.958
Marra! Leave it!

48:33.000 --> 48:34.000
Marra!

48:36.792 --> 48:37.792
Marra!

48:41.500 --> 48:42.500
- Marra!

48:46.125 --> 48:47.417
Come on, girl, down!

48:47.417 --> 48:49.625
- Marra!

48:49.625 --> 48:51.500
Yo, man,
you fucking prick! Come on!

48:51.500 --> 48:53.625
- Get your fucking dog back!
-  Oh, fuck, no.

48:53.625 --> 48:55.875
Get those bastards
under control!

48:55.875 --> 48:57.208
For fuck's sake, man!

48:57.208 --> 48:58.667
I told you not to do this!

48:58.667 --> 49:01.125
- Marra!
-  Get them back, man!

49:01.125 --> 49:02.708
-  Come on!

49:02.708 --> 49:03.833
Marra!

49:03.833 --> 49:05.417
-  Fuck's sake!
- Marra!

49:05.417 --> 49:08.500
-  Fucking grab him, man!

49:08.500 --> 49:10.500
- Marra!
-  Get his head!

49:10.500 --> 49:12.833
Get a hold of
the fucking thing, man!

49:12.833 --> 49:14.500
Fucking size of it, man!

49:21.708 --> 49:23.458
We need to go now.
Go, go, go, go, go!

49:23.458 --> 49:25.167
-  Marra!
-  Go, go, go, go!

49:25.167 --> 49:27.583
Marra!
You fucking bastards!

49:27.583 --> 49:28.833
-  Go!

49:28.833 --> 49:32.375
Marra! Marra!

49:32.375 --> 49:34.208
Marra!

49:35.917 --> 49:37.000
Go, go, go, go.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.250
You fucking... bastards.

49:47.125 --> 49:49.125
You fucking bastards!

49:50.125 --> 49:51.833
I'll fucking have you!

51:20.875 --> 51:23.542
Fuck.

51:38.292 --> 51:39.583
- Hi.
-  Hello.

51:39.583 --> 51:42.542
We were thinking of you.
Can we come in?

51:43.375 --> 51:44.833
Yeah, course you can.

51:50.750 --> 51:52.292
Please...

51:53.125 --> 51:55.042
- Take a seat.
-  Thank you.

52:00.125 --> 52:03.542
Er, bring a plate.
Just for yourself.

52:21.583 --> 52:25.500
Sometimes in life, there is
no need for words, only food.

52:26.542 --> 52:29.458
You make me feel
quite ashamed.

52:29.458 --> 52:32.625
After what you've been through,
to do this for me...

52:39.042 --> 52:40.125
Hm-hmm.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.500
There is no shame in love,
Mr Ballantyne.

52:45.500 --> 52:48.583
We understand loss.
Please, take a seat.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.417
Thank you.

52:59.833 --> 53:03.833
- You will like the food.
-  I'm sure I will.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.083
She won't leave until you eat.

53:28.375 --> 53:30.208
OK.

53:44.083 --> 53:45.458
That's very nice.

53:47.708 --> 53:49.333
Thank you.

53:49.333 --> 53:50.708
- Shukran?
-  Shukran.

53:50.708 --> 53:53.125
- Shukran.

53:54.042 --> 53:55.292
Thank you.

54:22.458 --> 54:24.208
When did you get Marra?

54:25.167 --> 54:27.208
April the 9th, two years ago.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.667
You remember the date?

54:29.667 --> 54:30.667
Yeah.

54:31.875 --> 54:34.042
It's a very special date to me.

54:36.667 --> 54:39.542
My father was a miner,
as you know.

54:41.083 --> 54:44.708
On April the 9th,
many years ago now...

54:46.583 --> 54:49.458
he was working on a seam
three mile out to sea,

54:49.458 --> 54:51.583
and he was killed
in an accident.

54:54.583 --> 54:56.500
So two years ago,

54:57.125 --> 55:00.625
my life was in such a mess...

55:02.583 --> 55:05.208
I decided
that on April the 9th...

55:07.000 --> 55:08.917
I would take my own life.

55:11.167 --> 55:14.083
Now, I don't know, that may
be hard for you to understand.

55:15.167 --> 55:16.958
It's not hard.

55:20.583 --> 55:23.500
Yara, I just made
so many mistakes.

55:25.958 --> 55:27.833
I'd just lost a good woman.

55:30.917 --> 55:33.167
I made time for everybody
except her,

55:33.167 --> 55:35.458
and by the time I realised...

55:36.458 --> 55:40.167
Well, it was too late.
She wanted a divorce.

55:41.458 --> 55:43.583
Do you have any children?

55:44.292 --> 55:46.833
Yeah. I have a son.

55:48.833 --> 55:50.667
He's a good lad,

55:50.667 --> 55:52.708
but he doesn't speak to me anymore.

55:54.125 --> 55:55.958
And I can't blame him.

55:57.250 --> 56:00.208
I just kept hurting everybody
that I loved and cared for.

56:03.458 --> 56:09.583
I mean, this place, The Old Oak,
it's dropping to bits.

56:11.042 --> 56:13.167
And I can't get it fixed.

56:15.792 --> 56:18.833
So when it was coming round
to April the 9th two years ago,

56:20.458 --> 56:22.125
I realised I had a way out.

56:25.667 --> 56:27.167
So I made a decision...

56:29.208 --> 56:31.167
to take me own life.

56:34.208 --> 56:36.208
<i>I walked down to the beach,</i>

56:36.208 --> 56:39.000
<i>I took a bearing
from the old pit head</i>

56:39.000 --> 56:40.958
<i>and I looked out at the horizon.</i>

56:42.208 --> 56:44.833
<i>And I just thought to meself,</i>

56:44.833 --> 56:46.917
<i>"If I can get three mile
out there...</i>

56:49.042 --> 56:51.000
<i>just above
where me father died..."</i>

56:52.250 --> 56:53.708
<i>I thought, "That'll do me."</i>

56:55.875 --> 56:58.292
<i>I couldn't come back from that,
I knew that.</i>

57:01.292 --> 57:03.375
I even left a note
on this table.

57:06.042 --> 57:08.750
"Tommy Joe Ballantyne's
gone for a swim."

57:12.167 --> 57:15.458
So... I stepped into the sea.

57:17.458 --> 57:19.208
And that's when it happened.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.875
Now, I'm not a religious person.

57:21.875 --> 57:26.000
I don't believe in God,
the afterlife, any of that.

57:28.792 --> 57:31.000
<i>- But as I stepped in the sea...</i>

57:31.000 --> 57:32.708
<i>...I heard this noise.</i>

57:34.708 --> 57:37.625
<i>- And I looked around.</i>

57:37.625 --> 57:41.000
<i>And there was this daft
little dog coming towards us.</i>

57:44.458 --> 57:46.167
<i>I remember thinking, "Not now."</i>

57:47.625 --> 57:49.083
<i>"Not today of all days."</i>

57:50.542 --> 57:52.333
<i>But it just kept coming.</i>

57:54.417 --> 57:56.375
<i>It came right up to me feet.</i>

57:57.625 --> 58:02.500
<i>And I looked down
and I saw it had a name tag.</i>

58:03.500 --> 58:05.083
<i>And it said "Marra".</i>

58:05.708 --> 58:08.292
<i>See, "marra"
is an old miners' word.</i>

58:10.083 --> 58:12.417
Your marra is your friend,

58:12.417 --> 58:15.208
but it runs much deeper
than that.

58:15.208 --> 58:17.458
He's your friend,
he's your equal.

58:18.500 --> 58:21.417
He's got your back,
you've got his.

58:21.417 --> 58:23.333
You keep each other safe.

58:25.042 --> 58:27.500
So all I could think of was,

58:27.500 --> 58:30.417
"What would my father
think of me?"

58:31.583 --> 58:33.458
So I stepped back.

58:34.708 --> 58:37.917
Brought the daft little dog
home with us.

58:38.500 --> 58:40.500
She gave us a reason
to get out of bed.

58:42.500 --> 58:44.083
Every time I looked at Marra...

58:45.708 --> 58:48.375
I saw the little dog that
gave us a second chance.

58:58.792 --> 59:00.667
- Youse all right?
- Hi, lasses, you all right?

59:00.667 --> 59:03.000
You all right, Maggie?
Just come to see how TJ is.

59:03.000 --> 59:04.458
He's all right. He's all right.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.333
He's in the back.
God knows what he's doing.

59:06.333 --> 59:07.750
- He's in the back?
- Aye.

59:07.750 --> 59:09.958
Erm, the door's not locked
if you wanna go in.

59:12.375 --> 59:13.708
TJ?

59:22.708 --> 59:24.500
- Get that, Yara. TJ?

59:25.875 --> 59:26.958
Oh!

59:29.083 --> 59:30.750
You all right?
What are you doing?

59:30.750 --> 59:32.792
What does it look
like I'm doing?

59:32.792 --> 59:34.333
I'm cleaning the kitchen.

59:35.083 --> 59:37.042
You're to blame for this,
the pair of youse!

59:37.042 --> 59:40.292
- Er... well, good.
-  Yeah.

59:40.292 --> 59:41.750
So, off with your coats,

59:41.750 --> 59:43.833
and get your backsides in here
and give us a hand.

59:43.833 --> 59:46.792
Right. We'll come back later.

59:46.792 --> 59:48.458
No, no, no!
You're not going anywhere!

59:48.458 --> 59:50.625
- I've started this cos of you.

59:50.625 --> 59:52.250
Get in here, give us a hand.

59:52.875 --> 59:54.875
- OK. OK.
- Yeah, right?

59:54.875 --> 59:56.167
- Come on.
- Right.

59:56.167 --> 59:57.250
- Uh-huh.
- Great.

59:57.250 --> 59:59.167
I've got plenty
of cleaning stuff. Come on.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:11.625
<i>A couple of people
came to me very recently</i>

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:15.292
<i>with an idea
that I reopen this room.</i>

01:00:15.292 --> 01:00:17.417
<i>And I wasn't receptive at all.</i>

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:22.208
<i>But what I wanna do now,
with your help,</i>

01:00:22.208 --> 01:00:24.167
<i>is I wanna reopen this room.</i>

01:00:25.833 --> 01:00:27.833
<i>And I wanna help the kids
in this village</i>

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.667
<i>who are in desperate need
of our help</i>

01:00:30.667 --> 01:00:32.333
<i>and in need of a meal.</i>

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:35.875
So then, Tony, are we safe?

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:38.625
Aye. I've replaced
these three fuses here.

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:39.792
- Right.
- Erm...

01:00:39.792 --> 01:00:42.000
But long term,
it needs sorting out, like,

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.417
cos otherwise you'll have a bit
of an issue on your hands.

01:00:44.417 --> 01:00:46.417
But for now, you're safe.

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:50.458
<i>I want to welcome
our new friends</i>

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:53.625
<i>who have left a war zone,
come to our community.</i>

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:57.083
<i>And what I want to do
is I want to use this space</i>

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.500
<i>so we meet together</i>

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.708
<i>and we sit down
and eat together.</i>

01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:02.917
That'll need a big scrub.

01:01:04.042 --> 01:01:06.417
If you can take that rubbish
out, that would be great.

01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:08.417
Anything that looks as though
it's unsafe,

01:01:08.417 --> 01:01:12.125
or needs chucking out,
exactly, needs to go.

01:01:12.125 --> 01:01:14.833
<i>This is solidarity.
It's not charity.</i>

01:01:14.833 --> 01:01:18.417
<i>This is about,
we do something together.</i>

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:21.417
<i>It's not just about putting some
food on a table as a one-off.</i>

01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:23.167
<i>I want this to be ongoing.</i>

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:27.208
How are you getting on,
Mo? Mo, you good?

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:28.708
- No, no.
-  No?

01:01:28.708 --> 01:01:30.458
No. Rust.

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:31.583
- Rust?
-  Rust, yeah.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.208
I can get you some WD-40
for that.

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:35.208
That's not a problem.
Do you wanna check that one?

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:37.500
-  Yusuf?
-  All right, is it safe?

01:01:40.042 --> 01:01:42.458
Savvy?
Does that mean safe? Yusuf?

01:01:43.792 --> 01:01:45.125
How are we getting on?

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.625
They don't understand
a word I say.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:48.500
I'm struggling, mate.
I'm struggling.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.875
Right, well, where's Yara?

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:52.083
She's up translating with Betty,
up there.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.458
- I didn't want to interrupt.
- No, can't interrupt that.

01:02:07.667 --> 01:02:09.250
- Hi.
-  Hiya. You all right?

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.792
Can I put these things in
for TJ?

01:02:11.792 --> 01:02:15.208
Yeah, you can. Put them
on the bottom table there.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:22.083
Hiya, you all right?

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:26.042
-  Hi.
-  Hi. You all right?

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:28.750
-  Hi.
-  Hi.

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.500
-  All right?
-  All right.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:31.625
All right, yeah.

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.167
- Food on the table?
- Wonderful.

01:02:43.708 --> 01:02:45.417
Away you go.

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:52.250
-  Yusuf!

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.125
- Hello.
-  Hiya, you all right?

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:55.917
-  Hiya.
-  Hiya. All right?

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:57.375
Yeah, good.

01:02:58.042 --> 01:03:02.000
Fucking <i>Ali Baba and the
Forty Thieves,</i> innit? Huh?

01:03:02.667 --> 01:03:05.458
Oh, for fuck's sake. Howay,
I'm gonna go sit down there.

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:08.000
Doing my fucking brain in.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.833
Just come in
for a quiet pint, man, Maggie.

01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:19.458
Is that too much to ask for?

01:03:19.458 --> 01:03:22.042
Charlie, it's TJ's idea.

01:03:22.042 --> 01:03:24.000
Yeah,
I bet it fucking is, an' all.

01:03:29.625 --> 01:03:31.250
- See you, bye.
-  See you.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.000
- Bye.
- See you, bye.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.375
-  All right. Ta-ra.
- Bye.

01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:35.958
-  Right. Bye.
- Bye.

01:03:35.958 --> 01:03:38.667
Ta-ra. See you later.
Bye. Have a nice day.

01:03:38.667 --> 01:03:40.125
-  Thank you.
- Aye.

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:43.083
Fuck off.

01:03:44.458 --> 01:03:45.958
The pub's not ours anymore,
is it?

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.042
Hello, Tony.
What are you doing here, son?

01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:51.625
- All right, Uncle Ed?
-  Why aye.

01:03:51.625 --> 01:03:54.000
Aye, the gaffer sent us over
to check on some wiring.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.625
I hope
you're getting paid, son.

01:03:55.625 --> 01:03:58.833
Ah, usual rate! Nah,
we're doing a favour for TJ.

01:03:58.833 --> 01:04:01.125
- All chipping in to help out.

01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:02.500
Anyway, I'll catch you later on.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.875
- Pint later on, eh?
- Aye! Why aye!

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:06.708
- Oh!
- Thank you.

01:04:07.792 --> 01:04:10.500
Hi, there. Is it OK to leave
these here for TJ, please?

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:12.917
Aye, just put them on
this bottom table there, pet.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.917
It's like
Grand Central Station.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.958
- What the fuck's this all about?
- A car boot sale or something?

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:24.667
Can you tell Laura that's
from the Fire Brigades Union,

01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:26.167
and there's more on the way.

01:04:26.167 --> 01:04:27.833
All right, OK.

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:30.875
Also, erm, I've found
an industrial juicer.

01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:33.125
Erm, can you just tell her
that Sammy's got it?

01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:34.833
It's second-hand
but it's in good nick.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:35.958
I'll drop it off later on.

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:37.667
-  All right.
- OK? Thank you.

01:04:37.667 --> 01:04:39.042
OK. Bye, pet.

01:04:39.042 --> 01:04:41.167
- You all right there, lads?
-  Aye.

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:43.667
- Enjoy your pint.
-  Aye. Great.

01:04:45.958 --> 01:04:49.458
- An industrial fucking juicer.
- What the hell's next, eh?

01:04:49.458 --> 01:04:51.500
A fucking Jacuzzi!

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.292
Fucking unions need
to mind their own business.

01:04:54.292 --> 01:04:55.917
Too much time on their hands.

01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:58.833
It's getting like fucking
Panama Canal in here, innit, eh?

01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:01.583
Aye. You're right there, lad.

01:05:03.458 --> 01:05:05.583
- Another pint please, Maggie.
-  Hm-hmm.

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:06.667
Anyone else?

01:05:06.667 --> 01:05:08.458
-  No.
-  No, I'm all right.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:17.250
- All right, Maggie.
-  So...

01:05:18.292 --> 01:05:20.208
Back room's
not good enough for us,

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:23.125
but it is good enough for them,
is that it, TJ?

01:05:23.125 --> 01:05:24.417
Hadn't planned it, Charlie.

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:25.750
All it is,
is a few of the locals

01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:27.958
trying to give a helping hand
to those that need it.

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.583
It's a few volunteers doing it.

01:05:29.583 --> 01:05:31.708
You and your family
are more than welcome to come.

01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:34.417
-  Aye, OK then.
- What's your problem, Vic?

01:05:34.417 --> 01:05:36.583
I'll tell you the problem,
shall I?

01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:38.625
The problem is we drink in here
all the time,

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:39.792
keeping you in business,

01:05:39.792 --> 01:05:41.500
and you treat us
like fucking shit.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.208
I don't treat you
like fucking shit.

01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:46.125
Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.
We asked you for a favour, mate.

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:48.625
One favour for a meeting.
One fucking meeting.

01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:50.750
And all you did was give us
a load of excuses.

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:53.208
But with these fuckers, right,

01:05:53.208 --> 01:05:55.042
you can give them
what they fucking want.

01:05:55.042 --> 01:05:56.375
As far as I'm concerned, mate,

01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:59.125
you're a fucking two-faced,
forty-faced arsehole.

01:05:59.125 --> 01:06:00.208
Easy, man.

01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:02.333
Aye, just calm down, Vic.

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:04.042
I mean, look at the place, TJ.

01:06:04.042 --> 01:06:06.708
It's like a bloody refugee camp.
It's a shithole.

01:06:06.708 --> 01:06:08.333
That's sad coming from you, mate.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:10.333
You're the one
that's fucking sad, mate.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.917
I tell you what it is, right?
I'm just trying to work it out.

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:15.417
Either you're going for the OBE
for charity work,

01:06:15.417 --> 01:06:17.417
or you're shagging her
in the fucking cellar.

01:06:17.417 --> 01:06:20.375
- Fucking watch your mouth, pal!
-  Make me! Fucking make me!

01:06:20.375 --> 01:06:22.417
I tell you what it is,
you're a fucking loser.

01:06:22.417 --> 01:06:24.000
Even your own son
won't talk to you.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.917
That's why your fucking wife
left you.

01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:28.917
- Me fucking wife?

01:06:28.917 --> 01:06:31.708
- Lads, lads! Lads, stop!
-  Mr Ballantyne, stop!

01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:33.625
I'll put you through
the fucking window!

01:06:33.625 --> 01:06:35.125
What's the matter?

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.417
Touched a nerve, did I,
Mr Ballantyne?

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:39.250
Get outside
and let's fucking sort it out!

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.292
That's enough, Vic!
You've gone too far!

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:46.625
TJ, this is the one last public
space we've got in our lives.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.792
All we want is our pub back.

01:06:48.792 --> 01:06:51.750
Is that too much to ask,
after all this time?

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.250
Howay. It's time you made
your mind up, son.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.583
And you,
with your fucking brass neck,

01:07:04.583 --> 01:07:06.542
not being disrespectful, pet,

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:08.417
but fuck off
where you come from.

01:07:08.417 --> 01:07:10.167
Go back.
That's what we want, too.

01:07:10.167 --> 01:07:12.417
Good. Well, hurry up. Bye.

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:17.083
Well said, Yara, pet.

01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:18.750
- You OK?
-  You all right?

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:20.667
- Maggie, you all right?
-  Yeah.

01:07:20.667 --> 01:07:23.167
I'm sorry about that. I'm sorry.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:26.458
-  You OK, guys?
-  Yeah.

01:07:45.542 --> 01:07:49.375
You slice up your bread
like that, like. Loads of chips.

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:52.458
Lovely, aren't they?
Especially with buttered bread.

01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:56.500
Is that your son over there?
What's his name?

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.000
- What's his name?
- My son?

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.083
- Yeah.

01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:00.208
Ah, OK.

01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:08.792
Everybody's OK
for a drink?

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:13.250
Howay,
they'll come around.

01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:16.917
Enjoy that?

01:08:16.917 --> 01:08:19.542
- Can I have some pizza please?
-  Course you can, Ryan.

01:08:20.875 --> 01:08:24.207
-  Oop! There you go.
- Thanks. Is this just for today?

01:08:24.207 --> 01:08:25.792
We're gonna try and do it
twice a week

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:27.000
and a special on a Saturday.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.832
So can I come here
every Saturday?

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:29.957
Course you can.

01:08:29.957 --> 01:08:32.417
- It is for free?
-  Absolutely, not a penny.

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:34.417
- Can I bring my gran?
-  Of course you can.

01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:36.332
She'll love to hear that. Thanks.

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:38.457
No problem at all.

01:08:38.457 --> 01:08:40.917
Hiya, can I have
some nuggets, please?

01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:45.332
Is that true?
This is... All this for free?

01:08:45.332 --> 01:08:47.500
-  Yeah, absolutely.
- Is it a promise?

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.082
We'll do the best we can.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:01.167
They told me all about
the Berlin Wall,

01:09:01.167 --> 01:09:03.457
and how soldiers were there
and kaput!

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:07.917
You want carrots?
Do you want carrots?

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:09.832
I was dipping it in the...

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:10.917
Good move.

01:09:10.917 --> 01:09:14.375
That's the perfect thing to do.
Is this your glass, pet?

01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:16.082
Er, that's...
Yeah, that's mine.

01:09:16.082 --> 01:09:17.167
It can be yours.

01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:23.417
- What's up, Max?
- Nothing.

01:09:24.332 --> 01:09:26.250
We've still got some food left.

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:28.417
- Is there?
- Yeah.

01:09:28.417 --> 01:09:31.000
If you eat in the kitchen,
no one will see you there.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.500
We won't say anything.

01:09:36.332 --> 01:09:37.375
Wait here.

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:53.042
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:09:53.042 --> 01:09:56.750
If you need anything, just ask.
We are as a family.

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:57.833
Thank you.

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:45.417
<i>Bashir, here's a video filmed by my sister.</i>

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:47.833
<i>Don't let Salim see it.</i>

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:51.000
<i>This is what happened to Othman's school.</i>

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.792
<i>Remember him?</i>

01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:04.000
Bashir, mother wants to tell us something.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:22.792
I have good news.

01:12:24.625 --> 01:12:27.042
Dad is still alive.

01:12:28.125 --> 01:12:30.125
Somebody saw him in prison.

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:42.750
It's the best news we could have.

01:12:57.208 --> 01:13:00.750
My father is still alive.

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.208
Someone saw him in the prison.
Please, don't stop.

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:13.208
Sometimes I wish he was dead,

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.750
we had his body
and I could bury him.

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.833
Where he is, there's
a hundred people into one cell.

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:29.208
So packed
they take turns to sit down.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.000
Starved, beaten.

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:39.667
Only few survive.

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:49.250
This is what the Assad regime
does to us.

01:13:54.875 --> 01:13:57.250
It's the hope
that causes so much pain.

01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:02.208
I'm so sorry, Yara.

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:08.250
But I have to be strong
for my family.

01:14:09.417 --> 01:14:11.000
And community.

01:14:11.833 --> 01:14:14.917
But it's all just... a big act.

01:14:18.292 --> 01:14:21.792
TJ, we're getting a donation
from the Cathedral.

01:14:21.792 --> 01:14:23.292
Can you go and collect it, please?

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.792
Aye, cheers, Phil, will do,
mate. Thank you.

01:14:25.792 --> 01:14:26.875
Thank you.

01:15:03.042 --> 01:15:05.125
- So that's the Cathedral.
-  Wow.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.875
Built nearly a thousand
years ago by the Normans.

01:15:08.875 --> 01:15:11.000
Me father loved it.

01:15:12.042 --> 01:15:13.917
But he always said
that the Cathedral

01:15:13.917 --> 01:15:16.042
doesn't belong to the Church,

01:15:16.042 --> 01:15:18.500
it belongs to the workers
that built it.

01:15:20.125 --> 01:15:22.458
We used to love coming
every July

01:15:22.458 --> 01:15:24.833
to watch the blessing
of the miners' banners,

01:15:24.833 --> 01:15:27.208
and then go on
to the big meeting.

01:15:27.208 --> 01:15:29.708
He used to love all the speeches
and the bands.

01:15:29.708 --> 01:15:32.583
- Just like in the photos.
- Yeah, just like in the photos.

01:15:32.583 --> 01:15:33.708
Can we go?

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.750
It's been a long time
since I went.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:40.167
So it's probably best
if you go with Laura.

01:15:53.833 --> 01:15:56.333
-  It's those as well, mate.
-  Right, cheers, Geoff.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.458
- Leave that, leave that.

01:16:01.458 --> 01:16:04.167
Tell you what, if you hurry up,
you can see the choir practice.

01:16:04.167 --> 01:16:05.333
- Really? Now?
- Yeah.

01:16:05.333 --> 01:16:07.417
Go through the arch,
then in the Cathedral.

01:16:07.417 --> 01:16:08.500
- OK.
- All right?

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:09.583
- I'm going.
- OK, enjoy.

01:18:41.667 --> 01:18:44.042
-  OK, well done.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Beautiful.

01:19:06.542 --> 01:19:10.750
My children will never see
the temple in Tadmor. Palmyra.

01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:14.917
Built by the Romans and
destroyed by the Islamic State.

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.083
When you have
half of your country in rubble

01:19:18.083 --> 01:19:21.292
and you see this...

01:19:21.292 --> 01:19:22.792
It makes me want to cry.

01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:27.458
What will Syria be like
in a thousand years?

01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.167
How many years
to cut the stones...

01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:39.875
to lift the weight,
to imagine the light?

01:19:41.833 --> 01:19:45.458
How many brilliant minds?
How much sweat?

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:49.375
How many people
working together?

01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:53.708
Such a beautiful place...

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:57.208
makes me want to hope again.

01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:03.625
When they torture,

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:08.625
when they target hospitals,
when they murder doctors,

01:20:10.208 --> 01:20:12.083
when they use chlorine gas,

01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:16.542
when the world stands by
and does nothing,

01:20:16.542 --> 01:20:18.208
that's when the regime lives.

01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:20.292
When the world does nothing.

01:20:22.125 --> 01:20:24.167
That's what they do to break us.

01:20:27.708 --> 01:20:31.125
It takes strength to hope,
but they want to smash it.

01:20:33.208 --> 01:20:35.667
It takes faith to hope.

01:20:39.250 --> 01:20:43.167
We tried to build something new,
something beautiful,

01:20:43.167 --> 01:20:45.667
and look at us.

01:20:45.667 --> 01:20:47.625
Thrown to the wolves.

01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:55.875
I have a friend
who calls hope "obscene".

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.083
Maybe she's right.

01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:08.417
But if I stop hoping,
my heart will stop beating.

01:22:48.917 --> 01:22:50.458
Aw.

01:22:54.917 --> 01:22:57.667
Aw.

01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:17.833
Aw.

01:23:23.292 --> 01:23:26.542
- I did me best!

01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:05.750
Our community has
prepared a little gift for you,

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:10.542
inspired by the miners' banners
and also by The Oak Tree,

01:24:10.542 --> 01:24:13.500
which we know, is so important
and so special for you.

01:24:14.292 --> 01:24:16.125
Yusuf and Abdul, please come.

01:25:17.083 --> 01:25:19.208
TJ!

01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:20.875
TJ, quick!

01:25:20.875 --> 01:25:21.958
Fuck's sake!

01:25:23.583 --> 01:25:26.167
TJ! Come down!

01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:30.333
TJ, come
and have a look at this, man!

01:25:33.125 --> 01:25:34.583
What's the matter?

01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:37.083
- Have a look.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:39.667
It's a right mess.

01:25:42.917 --> 01:25:44.375
Oh, bollocks!

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:49.542
It's the fucking pipework that
we got fixed the other week.

01:25:50.417 --> 01:25:53.667
- It's a complete disaster.
- The joints have all gone.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.375
Oh, fucking hell, man.

01:25:57.083 --> 01:25:59.708
Right, I'm gonna try
and turn it off.

01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:01.375
Do us a favour,
get Jaffa on the phone,

01:26:01.375 --> 01:26:03.000
cos he's meant
to have sorted this out.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.417
- Right, right. Will do.
- Great.

01:26:04.417 --> 01:26:06.208
Champion. Cheers, Maggie.

01:26:24.292 --> 01:26:25.292
Hi, Jaffa.

01:26:26.208 --> 01:26:28.875
The plumbing's knackered
and the kitchen's flooded

01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:30.542
and it's a right mess.

01:26:31.375 --> 01:26:32.792
<i>What about the electrics?</i>

01:26:32.792 --> 01:26:34.458
The electrics? I don't know.

01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:36.208
Hang on,
I'll just check the switch.

01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:37.917
-  <i>Maggie, don't!</i>

01:26:37.917 --> 01:26:40.375
Fucker! What the fucking hell
have you done?

01:26:40.375 --> 01:26:43.208
-  <i>What the fuck was that?</i>
-  For fuck's sake, man!

01:26:43.208 --> 01:26:46.083
<i>Maggie, are you all
right? Is everyone all right?</i>

01:26:46.083 --> 01:26:49.042
-  Sorry!
-  <i>What's happened?</i>

01:26:49.042 --> 01:26:51.292
Right. We'll have
to get Tony down here.

01:26:51.292 --> 01:26:54.250
It's just going from bad
to worse, isn't it?

01:26:55.958 --> 01:26:58.417
It's not looking good, TJ.

01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:01.750
Jaffa's meant to have told
them Syrian lads

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:03.667
to double-check them joints.

01:27:03.667 --> 01:27:05.583
And that's what's gone, so...

01:27:05.583 --> 01:27:08.792
they either weren't listening
to him or didn't understand him.

01:27:08.792 --> 01:27:11.417
I cannot believe that's just
gone straight in the electrics.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.458
I don't know, TJ.
Just... everything's ruined.

01:27:15.458 --> 01:27:17.542
Everything we've worked for.

01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.667
Sorry, TJ, mate. They're done.

01:27:22.208 --> 01:27:25.042
Total rewiring. It's a big job.

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:29.208
And you can't use this room.
Nay chance. It's not safe.

01:27:29.208 --> 01:27:31.750
Tony, what about the bar?

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:33.542
Or have I screwed that up
as well?

01:27:33.542 --> 01:27:36.333
It's on a separate ring main,
so the bar's fine.

01:27:37.167 --> 01:27:40.917
But it's not your fault, Maggie.
It would make no difference.

01:27:40.917 --> 01:27:43.667
Your boiler, that's fucked.

01:27:43.667 --> 01:27:45.833
That's gonna cost you
about two grand.

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:48.000
And then just look at the floor.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.042
It's soaked the joists
and the subfloor.

01:27:50.042 --> 01:27:51.958
It's gonna cost you a fortune!

01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:54.500
Wait, the insurance
will cover it, won't it?

01:27:56.583 --> 01:27:57.917
No, it won't.

01:27:58.833 --> 01:28:01.292
We cut this room off
from the insurance

01:28:01.292 --> 01:28:04.625
because it wasn't being used
by the public.

01:28:04.625 --> 01:28:07.625
So in order
to bring the cost down...

01:28:08.875 --> 01:28:11.208
- we didn't need it.
- Youse haven't got insurance?

01:28:12.208 --> 01:28:13.708
I couldn't afford it.

01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:21.667
So, what am I gonna say
to the kids now, eh?

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.375
Hello, mate. Can I have
two pints of lager, please, man?

01:28:33.375 --> 01:28:35.417
Of course you can, mate.

01:28:35.417 --> 01:28:38.000
I'll tell you what, we need
to fucking give them some...

01:28:39.375 --> 01:28:40.792
Happen so.

01:28:40.792 --> 01:28:43.083
Like, the person sitting
watching TV, doing this,

01:28:43.083 --> 01:28:45.042
and you're sort of going...
like that.

01:28:45.042 --> 01:28:47.917
And then in the actual cinema
itself, you can just hear...

01:28:47.917 --> 01:28:50.500
It's a great atmosphere tonight,
TJ. Huh?

01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:52.417
I mean, the place is bouncing, innit?

01:28:52.417 --> 01:28:54.875
Aye, just like the old days. Banging.

01:28:56.792 --> 01:28:59.458
None of the fucking missionary
work going on next door.

01:28:59.458 --> 01:29:01.458
- No.
- Just peace and quiet.

01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:02.958
- Here.
- Cheers.

01:29:02.958 --> 01:29:04.500
- Nay problem, cheers.
- Thank you.

01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:09.292
- 'Ey up, mate. All right?
- Are you getting me one?

01:29:09.292 --> 01:29:12.000
- He's got the money.
- It's my round, isn't it?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.333
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

01:29:13.333 --> 01:29:15.250
I'll have a couple
of pints of bitter

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:17.125
while you're on there, TJ, eh?

01:29:17.125 --> 01:29:19.250
I've gotta hand it to you, TJ.

01:29:19.250 --> 01:29:21.042
You were right, you know.

01:29:21.042 --> 01:29:22.833
I mean, you said it yourself

01:29:22.833 --> 01:29:25.917
that that lounge
wasn't fit for purpose.

01:29:25.917 --> 01:29:29.000
I mean, from what I heard,
it was a fucking death trap.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.708
You should have listened
to your own advice, mate.

01:29:31.708 --> 01:29:33.667
Howay, lads.
Leave it out, will you?

01:29:33.667 --> 01:29:35.458
I'm trying to have a good night
over here.

01:29:35.458 --> 01:29:37.208
We're just chatting,
you know.

01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:39.500
Bit of sympathy for the lad,
you know what I mean?

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:43.375
I tell you what it is, TJ.

01:29:43.375 --> 01:29:46.125
Maybes it wouldn't have happened
if you'd used an English plumber

01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.250
instead of one of those
fucking foreign cowboys.

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:50.083
That's the trouble, you know,
these days.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:51.917
Cheap foreign labour.
It's shite.

01:29:51.917 --> 01:29:53.667
-  Useless.
-  Fucking crap.

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:57.458
I heard a rumour
about no insurance.

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:00.500
- Is that true?
-  Here.

01:30:01.375 --> 01:30:02.625
Ah!

01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:05.250
Sometimes we just don't
get round to these things.

01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:07.542
You know how it is.
Busy lives and that.

01:30:07.542 --> 01:30:09.917
You'll not be selling this place
in a hurry.

01:30:09.917 --> 01:30:12.500
Mind, you've gone very quiet.

01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:14.625
What've you got
to say for yourself?

01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:17.250
Tell you what
I've got to say for meself.

01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:19.000
Why don't you
just shut the fuck up?

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.167
- Oh! Easy, TJ!

01:30:21.167 --> 01:30:22.250
Wind him up!

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.583
Think before you speak.
You'll need these people soon.

01:30:25.583 --> 01:30:30.042
Listen, we wanna help you out.
Let bygones be bygones, man.

01:30:30.042 --> 01:30:31.917
I mean, look at the place.
It's full!

01:30:32.792 --> 01:30:35.667
You help us and we'll help you.

01:30:35.667 --> 01:30:39.417
This is our pub,
these are our kind.

01:30:39.417 --> 01:30:40.875
Our people.

01:30:42.208 --> 01:30:44.000
Come on, we're gonna go.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.333
-  Are you going, Charlie?
- See you later, lads.

01:30:46.333 --> 01:30:48.500
-  What's the matter?
- Get the door, Michelle.

01:30:50.583 --> 01:30:52.542
-  Ta-ra, mate.
- What's the matter with you?

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:56.167
It's only early yet, man.
Catch you later, Mary!

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.083
Bastards.

01:32:09.417 --> 01:32:11.000
- All right, mate?
- You all right, TJ?

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.250
Can I have a word?

01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:13.750
Not today, mate.
It's not the time.

01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:15.917
Hey, look,
I need to speak to you now, TJ.

01:32:16.583 --> 01:32:18.792
- All right, come in then.
- Cheers.

01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:25.500
Away through.

01:32:31.583 --> 01:32:33.667
- Take a seat, mate.
- Ta.

01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:42.083
D'you remember coaching us
at football?

01:32:42.083 --> 01:32:43.167
- Aye.
- Aye.

01:32:43.167 --> 01:32:45.958
You always said speak your mind,
it'd be kept private.

01:32:45.958 --> 01:32:47.042
Aye.

01:32:47.042 --> 01:32:49.375
- Does that still hold?
- Course it does, mate.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:52.000
Just... I've gotta get something
off me chest, mate.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.583
I couldn't even sleep
last night.

01:32:55.583 --> 01:32:58.708
But you've got to promise
it's just between us, aye?

01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:01.583
You've got me word.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.250
Uncle Eddy
and couple of the lads,

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:08.042
Gary and Vic, came round
my house after the pub closed.

01:33:08.042 --> 01:33:10.083
You know how my father's
got a load of drink

01:33:10.083 --> 01:33:11.625
stashed in the shed?

01:33:12.542 --> 01:33:15.542
And I'm in the kitchen
making summat to eat

01:33:15.542 --> 01:33:17.583
and I can hear every word.

01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:20.333
And you know what Vic's like
when he's had a drink.

01:33:20.333 --> 01:33:22.792
He becomes more of a fucking
dickhead than he already is.

01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:23.917
Aye.

01:33:23.917 --> 01:33:26.417
And he's shouting off
to me father and showing off.

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:29.000
Everyone, everyone knew

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.875
the plumbing in the back room
was dodgy.

01:33:32.583 --> 01:33:35.833
And I hear Vic explain that the
water pressure rises at night.

01:33:36.667 --> 01:33:38.583
And all they had to do
was loosen the joint

01:33:38.583 --> 01:33:40.958
between the tank and the pipe...

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:47.042
and as the water pressure rises,
it would give way and...

01:33:47.542 --> 01:33:49.208
nobody would know.

01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:51.375
Bastards.

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:54.958
- Wasn't just the drink talking?
- No.

01:33:54.958 --> 01:33:57.208
I heard them say it.

01:33:57.208 --> 01:33:59.833
They wanted to put the back room
out of action and blame the...

01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:02.792
Blame the ragheads.
That's what they said.

01:34:02.792 --> 01:34:04.792
Fucking bastards.

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:10.500
So that's Vic, Gary
and your Uncle Eddy.

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.208
Anybody else involved?

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:16.417
- Charlie.
- Nah, not Charlie.

01:34:17.167 --> 01:34:19.500
Charlie was the one
who forced the window open.

01:34:21.958 --> 01:34:24.958
No, I cannot believe that.
Not Charlie.

01:34:27.333 --> 01:34:30.625
I heard Vic say Charlie
wanted to teach you a lesson.

01:34:30.625 --> 01:34:33.208
Apparently, him and Mary
got engaged in that back room.

01:34:33.208 --> 01:34:34.750
Aye.

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:39.500
And he wanted a favour.
Like, one meeting in there.

01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:41.417
And you blanked him.

01:34:41.417 --> 01:34:43.542
Vic said Charlie
felt humiliated.

01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.583
Fuck.

01:34:46.833 --> 01:34:48.500
We went to school together.

01:34:49.917 --> 01:34:51.792
In the same class at school.

01:34:54.125 --> 01:34:56.833
We used to eat at each other's
houses when we were bairns.

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:01.875
His father was down the pit
with mine.

01:35:24.917 --> 01:35:26.458
You all right?

01:35:26.458 --> 01:35:30.542
Charlie, look at the state
of the whole village, man.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.458
Look at all the crap that's
happened to us over the years.

01:35:34.458 --> 01:35:36.458
The stuff that's happened
to you,

01:35:36.458 --> 01:35:40.042
the stuff that's happened to me,
and both of our fathers.

01:35:41.208 --> 01:35:43.208
This place has been
going to shite for years,

01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:45.458
long before
the Syrians got here.

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:48.708
Now, I know
you're not a stupid man.

01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:51.792
So how have you become this?

01:36:00.833 --> 01:36:03.792
I... I don't know
what you're on about, man.

01:36:04.417 --> 01:36:07.708
We all look for a scapegoat when
life goes to shit, don't we?

01:36:07.708 --> 01:36:11.125
We never look up.
It's always look down.

01:36:11.125 --> 01:36:13.333
Blame the poor bastards
below us.

01:36:13.333 --> 01:36:15.250
It's always their fault.

01:36:16.083 --> 01:36:18.583
That makes it easier to stamp
on the poor bastards' faces,

01:36:18.583 --> 01:36:20.792
doesn't it? Eh?

01:36:22.625 --> 01:36:24.417
I just want you to know, Charlie...

01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:28.042
I know.

01:36:31.208 --> 01:36:32.875
I know.

01:36:44.542 --> 01:36:47.583
Obviously,
the situation's not good.

01:36:47.583 --> 01:36:50.417
Erm, but it's really good
to know people want to help.

01:36:50.417 --> 01:36:52.333
And, you know,
everyone wants to help.

01:36:52.333 --> 01:36:54.625
I'm gonna speak to Margaret
and Jaffa later, as well.

01:36:54.625 --> 01:36:57.083
They just couldn't be here.

01:36:57.083 --> 01:36:59.375
But first things first, really.

01:36:59.375 --> 01:37:02.000
We need to think about
talking to the families.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.625
There's people
expecting food today.

01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:07.417
TJ, I don't suppose
you've made a start, have you?

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.500
Aye, the kids got to us.

01:37:12.667 --> 01:37:13.917
Erm...

01:37:13.917 --> 01:37:18.292
Linda just said, "It's OK, TJ,
nothing good ever lasts."

01:37:20.583 --> 01:37:23.583
Little Ryan just said,
"I knew it. I knew it."

01:37:24.458 --> 01:37:27.583
Called us a liar
and walked away.

01:37:29.042 --> 01:37:31.708
And Max wouldn't even
look us in the face.

01:37:31.708 --> 01:37:35.458
Listen... that's awful.

01:37:35.458 --> 01:37:37.792
This is awful.
But we cannot be beaten by it.

01:37:37.792 --> 01:37:38.917
This is the best thing

01:37:38.917 --> 01:37:41.250
that's happened
to our community for years.

01:37:41.250 --> 01:37:43.167
I mean,
I can get back to me mates

01:37:43.167 --> 01:37:44.875
in the trade union movement.

01:37:44.875 --> 01:37:48.375
Try and get some new funding.
There must be cash somewhere.

01:37:48.375 --> 01:37:51.500
Why aye. And there's...
and there's local churches,

01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:53.958
there's local business, shops.

01:37:53.958 --> 01:37:55.542
We can get there.

01:37:55.542 --> 01:37:58.000
It'll take time.
But we can get there.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.500
How many times have we
heard that over the years, eh?

01:38:01.833 --> 01:38:03.875
I've spent a lifetime
trying to get there.

01:38:04.875 --> 01:38:07.417
And I've never got close.

01:38:07.417 --> 01:38:09.375
It was just self-delusion.

01:38:10.792 --> 01:38:12.250
Whether it's the strike...

01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:14.625
this fucking pub...

01:38:16.417 --> 01:38:17.417
the village.

01:38:17.417 --> 01:38:19.500
I mean, half the country's
fucking rotten.

01:38:21.125 --> 01:38:23.625
But, Laura, you know
what <i>is</i> getting there?

01:38:23.625 --> 01:38:27.833
It's hate, lies, corruption.

01:38:29.083 --> 01:38:31.125
It stinks to high heaven.

01:38:32.167 --> 01:38:34.708
- And betrayal.
-  What?

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:37.375
Because what happened here
wasn't an accident.

01:38:37.375 --> 01:38:40.125
Betrayal?
That's a strong word, TJ.

01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:41.208
Eh?

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:43.458
You're gonna have to tell us
a bit more about that, mate.

01:38:43.458 --> 01:38:45.042
What do you mean, no accident?

01:38:45.042 --> 01:38:46.542
TJ, you're gonna
have to tell us.

01:38:46.542 --> 01:38:49.667
You're gonna have to
tell us. It's that word, mate.

01:38:49.667 --> 01:38:51.333
It's not the time,
it's not the time.

01:38:51.333 --> 01:38:52.750
TJ, please tell us.

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:55.167
You can't say "betrayal"
and not tell us some more, mate.

01:38:55.167 --> 01:38:57.083
-  What do you mean?
- Betrayal by who?

01:38:57.083 --> 01:38:59.208
Just shut the fuck up!

01:39:02.625 --> 01:39:05.792
I cannot do this anymore.
I cannot.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.750
All that matters
is they closed me down.

01:39:12.875 --> 01:39:14.500
Cos we tried to help
some families

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:16.833
coming from a fucking war zone.

01:39:18.375 --> 01:39:20.542
Tried to help families

01:39:20.542 --> 01:39:22.833
who have to choose
between feeding their bairns

01:39:22.833 --> 01:39:24.667
and heating their house.

01:39:25.542 --> 01:39:28.125
Families humiliated cos
they can't feed their kids...

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.250
in one of the richest countries
in the fucking world.

01:39:33.125 --> 01:39:35.667
And we were helping them.
We were doing something good.

01:39:35.667 --> 01:39:38.250
And the bastards closed we down.

01:39:39.708 --> 01:39:40.750
TJ...

01:39:41.625 --> 01:39:44.667
Listen, TJ. I know, mate, but...

01:39:45.583 --> 01:39:48.375
You've hardly slept.
Please try and take it easy.

01:39:48.375 --> 01:39:50.542
I've been asleep
for years, love.

01:39:50.542 --> 01:39:53.042
I saw it on the kids' faces.

01:39:53.042 --> 01:39:55.333
I saw it on the faces
of those bastards next door,

01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:57.083
who took the piss out of me
all day.

01:39:57.083 --> 01:40:00.625
Who stood and fucking smirked,
took the piss,

01:40:00.625 --> 01:40:03.167
fucking thought
this was clever, funny...

01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.625
They get shit dumped on them
all the time,

01:40:07.625 --> 01:40:09.208
crap served on top of it.

01:40:11.542 --> 01:40:14.125
They say nowt,
they don't complain.

01:40:14.125 --> 01:40:16.750
They just accept it,
that that's the norm.

01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:18.792
They're just fucking doormats.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.208
If you expect nothing,
you get nothing.

01:40:24.583 --> 01:40:27.042
They fucking...

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:31.417
Say nowt,
look after your own, eh?

01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:33.042
Law of the fucking jungle.

01:40:33.042 --> 01:40:35.333
That's what they've learned
around here.

01:40:35.333 --> 01:40:36.875
Mr Ballantyne?

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:40.125
Mr Ballantyne, please believe.

01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:43.833
I can't, Yara.

01:40:44.583 --> 01:40:46.292
I can't.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:49.125
I'm done.

01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:51.792
It's over.

01:40:53.250 --> 01:40:56.583
- Oh, man! TJ, man!
- Listen, lads. Just...

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:58.750
- TJ, man?
- Joe. Joe, just leave him.

01:40:58.750 --> 01:41:00.708
Look, he's not in a good place. Just...

01:41:00.708 --> 01:41:02.375
You're right. You're right, aye.

01:42:02.833 --> 01:42:04.208
TJ!

01:42:05.125 --> 01:42:08.208
Come here! Let me talk to you!

01:42:38.208 --> 01:42:39.708
It's Yara's dad.

01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:51.333
- Let's put it by here.
- Yeah.

01:43:07.042 --> 01:43:10.333
Bashir, salaam alaykum.
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:43:11.458 --> 01:43:13.833
- I've brought these.
- Hi, TJ. Thank you.

01:43:13.833 --> 01:43:15.458
Er, there's...

01:43:15.458 --> 01:43:17.292
Yara.

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:19.208
I'm so sorry.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.375
And TJ's here.

01:43:32.708 --> 01:43:35.167
Yara,
I don't want to intrude.

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:37.792
Erm... but I just want to say
I'm really sorry.

01:43:37.792 --> 01:43:39.542
Thank you.

01:43:41.667 --> 01:43:43.792
They found my father's body.

01:43:46.375 --> 01:43:49.292
At least we can bury him
and let him rest.

01:43:50.375 --> 01:43:52.750
- I'm so sorry.

01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:57.167
He was a beautiful man.

01:43:57.792 --> 01:43:59.500
I'm sure he was.

01:44:00.333 --> 01:44:02.125
I'm sure he was.

01:44:02.125 --> 01:44:04.083
- Come.
- Er...

01:44:04.083 --> 01:44:06.958
- No, come, come.
- OK.

01:44:08.125 --> 01:44:09.125
Thank you, Yara.

01:44:20.250 --> 01:44:22.917
- Thank you.
- Shukran.

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.500
Yara!

01:45:08.792 --> 01:45:10.875
- Hi, Yara.
-  Hi.

01:45:10.875 --> 01:45:14.833
I'm really sorry.
We didn't know what to do.

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.500
Had a word with Rima.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.208
She said it'd be OK
to come round.

01:45:19.208 --> 01:45:21.000
Thank you so much.

01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:25.000
Mama?

01:45:25.583 --> 01:45:26.625
Mama?

01:45:35.708 --> 01:45:37.167
Go on.

01:45:39.250 --> 01:45:40.792
We're really sorry
for your father

01:45:40.792 --> 01:45:43.958
and we're really sorry
for your husband.

01:45:43.958 --> 01:45:46.750
And we're really, really sorry
for your country.

01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:48.167
Thank you.

01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:52.417
Thank you so much.

01:45:54.042 --> 01:45:55.042
Thank you.

01:45:59.125 --> 01:46:01.250
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

01:46:01.875 --> 01:46:04.083
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:09.500
If there's anything I can do,
just tell, just ask.

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:12.500
Thank you so much.
Thank you for everything.

01:46:16.917 --> 01:46:18.667
I'm so sorry.

01:46:22.583 --> 01:46:23.750
Thank you so much.

01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:26.250
Thank you.

01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:31.083
Harry. Cheers, mate.

01:46:36.875 --> 01:46:38.708
-  Thank you.
-  Thank you.

01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:45.583
-  Thank you.
-  Thank you.

01:46:45.583 --> 01:46:46.750
Thank you.

01:46:51.583 --> 01:46:53.042
Thank you.

01:46:54.417 --> 01:46:56.583
- Nah, nor me.

01:46:57.542 --> 01:47:00.375
- Look at this.
- They're still coming.

01:47:00.375 --> 01:47:01.917
They've come from everywhere.

01:47:01.917 --> 01:47:04.000
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:05.625
Thank you so much.

01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.125
I'm so sorry.

01:47:10.792 --> 01:47:13.667
Thank you.
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

01:47:21.458 --> 01:47:22.875
Thank you.

01:47:34.417 --> 01:47:35.792
Thank you.

01:47:44.333 --> 01:47:47.458
Thank you for coming.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:47:48.458 --> 01:47:49.583
Thank you so much.

01:47:49.583 --> 01:47:51.625
Thank you, really.
It means a lot. Thank you.

01:48:48.250 --> 01:48:49.250
Thank you.

01:49:27.042 --> 01:49:28.333
Shukran, Mr Ballantyne.

01:49:30.458 --> 01:49:32.250
Shukran, Yara.
