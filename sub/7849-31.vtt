NOT ON LOOKOUT ANYMORE.

19:39.600 --> 19:40.834
ON LOOKOUT FOR WHAT?

19:40.834 --> 19:43.200
CUSTOMERS.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT THE EXPIRATION DATES
ARE IN ORDER,

19:45.600 --> 19:47.300
JUST AS YOU ASKED.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.800
OH. SO YOU DIDN'T
FEEL MY REQUEST
WAS UNREASONABLE?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.400
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.367
OR A WASTE OF
YOUR VALUABLE TIME?

19:54.367 --> 19:56.900
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.400
AND, ESTEBAN,

19:58.400 --> 20:02.400
YOU DON'T FEEL I'VE BEEN
A BIT HARD ON YOU LATELY?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.700
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:05.567 --> 20:07.767
YOU KNOW, A BIT OF A...

20:07.767 --> 20:10.200
MEANIE-BO-BEANIE-SLOWVENIE?

20:11.400 --> 20:13.100
THE SLOWVENIE PART
WAS HERS, NOT MINE.

20:13.100 --> 20:14.100
AH.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.200
WAIT. HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THAT E-MAIL?

20:17.200 --> 20:18.367
WE DELETED IT.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.100
NOT BEFORE I READ IT
ON MY CELLPHONE.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.867
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DELETED IT?

20:21.867 --> 20:23.900
WELL, THEY SNUCK
INTO YOUR OFFICE.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.100
I WAS LOOKOUT.

20:27.900 --> 20:30.300
MR. MOSEBY, I NEVER
MEANT TO SEND
THAT E-MAIL.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.867
I WAS JUST
VENTING MY FEELINGS,

20:31.867 --> 20:33.700
AND THEN I WAS
GONNA DELETE IT.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.100
SO YOU NEVER MEANT
TO SEND IT?

20:36.100 --> 20:37.400
OF COURSE NOT.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.967
THAT WOULD BE
DISRESPECTFUL.

20:38.967 --> 20:41.300
WELL, THAT DOES MAKE IT
A LITTLE BETTER.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.967
I REALLY
AM SORRY.

20:42.967 --> 20:44.500
ME, TOO.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.033
IN THE FUTURE,
IF EITHER ONE OF YOU

20:46.033 --> 20:47.600
FEEL I HAVE
DONE SOMETHING
THAT IS UNFAIR,

20:47.600 --> 20:49.000
PLEASE JUST COME
AND TALK TO ME.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
AND IF YOU EVER SNEAK
INTO MY OFFICE AGAIN,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.767
YOUR JOBS WILL REACH
THEIR EXPIRATION DATE.

20:54.767 --> 20:55.800
UNDERSTOOD.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.600
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN
AGAIN, MR. MOSEBY.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.300
AND BY THE WAY,

21:00.300 --> 21:04.200
IT'S AFRO, JHERI CURL,
THEN FADE.

21:05.233 --> 21:07.734
I'M RICH.

21:20.734 --> 21:23.800
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE LOST ALL
THAT GREAT STUFF

21:23.800 --> 21:26.100
BECAUSE YOU DECIDED
TO GET GREEDY.

21:26.100 --> 21:27.367
I KNOW, I KNOW.

21:27.367 --> 21:30.100
GUYS, I'M SORRY.

21:30.100 --> 21:33.400
[AS ELVIS] I AIN'T
NOTHIN' BUT A LOSER.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.567
HONEY, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

21:36.567 --> 21:38.467
IT WAS JUST A GAME SHOW.

21:38.467 --> 21:41.467
AND SO YOU DIDN'T WIN
THE TRIP TO HAWAII,

21:41.467 --> 21:43.500
WHERE I'VE ALWAYS
DREAMED OF GOING,

21:43.500 --> 21:46.700
LYING ON THE BEACH,
WITH SUN ON MY FACE,

21:46.700 --> 21:49.000
LISTENING TO
THE SOUND OF THE WAVES.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
OH, I WANTED
THAT TRIP SO BAD!

21:52.000 --> 21:54.767
[SOBBING]

21:54.767 --> 21:56.767
DON'T CRY, LITTLE LADY.

21:56.767 --> 22:00.400
YOU'RE GETTIN' TEARS
ON MY BLUE SUEDE SHOES.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.233
FORGET IT. SHE'S GONNA
BE CRYING ALL NIGHT.

22:03.233 --> 22:05.400
WE'RE NEVER
GONNA GET ANY SLEEP.

22:05.400 --> 22:08.600
HEY, DIDN'T WE WIN
A FREE ROOM IN THIS HOTEL?

22:08.600 --> 22:12.000
[AS JERRY]
THAT'S RIGHT, CODYCITO,

22:12.000 --> 22:13.834
YOU FREAK.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.600
RACE YOU DOWN
TO THE FRONT DESK.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.400
SURE.
OHH!

22:19.000 --> 22:21.133
[SOBBING]

22:23.200 --> 22:25.700
OW!
