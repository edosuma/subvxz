WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:06.807
WHY IS ALL THIS STUFF
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

00:06.874 --> 00:08.409
STEVE URKEL'S COMING OVER.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.444
HE'S PAYING ME
TO GET HIM IN SHAPE.

00:10.511 --> 00:13.347
IS THERE ANY REASON YOU COULDN'T
DO THIS IN YOUR BEDROOM?

00:13.414 --> 00:17.751
YEAH. YOU TOLD ME,
"NEVER LET HIM UPSTAIRS."

00:17.818 --> 00:19.487
GOOD POINT.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.791
HI, EDDIE.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.126
HI, STEVE.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.529
I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING
THE TIME TO PUMP ME UP.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.565
NO SWEAT, BUDDY.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.468
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE WARM UP?
YOU READY?

00:34.535 --> 00:35.336
WATCH ME.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.271
ONE. TWO.
ONE. TWO.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.673
ONE. TWO.
ONE. TWO.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.745
THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.216
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HURT YOURSELF.

00:48.282 --> 00:53.254
THIS IS GREAT, EDDIE.
I FEEL A PUMP COMIN' ON.

00:53.321 --> 00:55.623
NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE?

00:58.959 --> 01:01.862
YEAH. IT'S SCARY.

01:01.929 --> 01:05.032
UM, WHY DON'T WE JUST GO
STRAIGHT TO SOME BENCH PRESSING?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.667
LIE DOWN.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.805
THE OTHER WAY.

01:16.810 --> 01:21.182
OKAY. NOW, GRIP THE BAR
AND DO THREE SETS OF FIVE.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.817
GO.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.656
BOY, THIS IS EASY.

01:28.722 --> 01:29.823
[PHONE RINGING]

01:29.890 --> 01:32.126

EDDIE!

01:41.068 --> 01:42.570
STEVE.

01:42.636 --> 01:43.737
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

01:43.804 --> 01:47.475
I-I'M SCULPTING MY BODY
FOR YOU, MY LOVE.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.677
HOW MUCH WEIGHT

01:51.579 --> 01:52.780

02:21.909 --> 02:26.614

03:33.814 --> 03:35.916
WHAT IN THE WORLD POSSESSED
YOU BOYS

03:35.983 --> 03:38.986
TO BRING A TIMBER WOLF
INTO THE HOUSE?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.989
WE GOT THE IDEA
FROM YOU, DAD.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.792
REMEMBER?
YOU TOLD US HOW
YOU ONCE KIDNAPPED

03:44.858 --> 03:47.328
YOUR RIVAL SCHOOL'S
MASCOT.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.063
YES, SON,
BUT THAT WAS IN
THE SIXTIES.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.266
I DID IT FOR PEACE.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.771
HI, EVERYBODY.

03:57.838 --> 03:58.972
BOY, WHAT A DAY.

03:59.039 --> 04:01.509
THE MOST INCREDIBLE
THING HAPPENED
TO ME TODAY.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.978
HUSH. WE'RE WATCHING
THE BUDDY GOODRICH SHOW.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.714
THE BUDDY GOODRICH SHOW?

04:06.780 --> 04:08.749
YOU'D RATHER WATCH TV
THAN TALK TO ME?

04:08.816 --> 04:11.885
HE'S ON ONCE A WEEK.
YOU'RE HERE EVERY DAY.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.624
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR
ABOUT MY DAY.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.462
SEE? YOU MADE ME MISS
A BIG JOKE.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.165
THIS IS
THE TOP TV SHOW?

04:25.232 --> 04:27.000
A SITCOM
ABOUT A RICH BLACK MAN

04:27.067 --> 04:29.870
WHO ADOPTS
TWO WHITE ORPHANS.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.972
THEY'RE ADOPTED?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.307
OHH!

04:33.374 --> 04:34.908
NOW I GET IT.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.814
COME ON, RICHIE.
COME ON, BABY.

04:40.881 --> 04:45.118
SHOW MAMA THAT LOOK
THAT'S GOING TO
DRIVE THE GIRLS CRAZY.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.219
COME ON.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.822
COME ON. OH--
THAT'S THE ONE.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.892
MOTHERS OF AMERICA,
LOCK UP YOUR DAUGHTERS.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.329
HI.

04:55.396 --> 04:57.197
HI, HONEY.

04:57.264 --> 04:58.432
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.600
UNBELIEVABLE.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.002
REALLY? TELL US
ABOUT IT.

05:02.069 --> 05:05.639
IT'S NICE THAT
EVERYONE DOESN'T LOVE
THE BUDDY GOODRICH SHOW.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.809
OH! DID THAT START
ALREADY? SHOOT!

05:13.046 --> 05:16.384
DON'T WORRY, HONEY.
I'LL TAKE YOU OVER
BUDDY GOODRICH ANY DAY.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.420
[LAUGHTER]

05:21.054 --> 05:22.089
GO AHEAD.

05:28.195 --> 05:33.200
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GOING
TO EAT THE DUCK.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.736
THAT MICKEY IS A RIOT.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.304
SCOOT OVER.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.240
WE'RE SORRY.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.743
I'M SORRY I LEFT
THE BATHROOM WINDOW OPEN

05:42.810 --> 05:45.746
AND LET THE TIMBER WOLF
GET AWAY.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.549
NAH, KIDS,
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

05:48.616 --> 05:52.620
I SHOULD HAVE KEPT
MY PAST A SECRET.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.355
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING.

05:55.423 --> 05:56.790
I'LL PAY FOR
THE DAMAGES.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
I'LL TAKE US
TO DINNER.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.595
I'LL EVEN TRAP
A NEW MASCOT.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.398
DAD...

06:05.999 --> 06:08.869
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD
WE EVER HAD.

06:19.312 --> 06:22.382
OH. THAT MAN
IS WONDERFUL.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.886
WHAT A GREAT DAD.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.755
HE'S NOT REAL.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.023
WHAT DOES HE DO
FOR A LIVING?

06:30.090 --> 06:34.394
HE'S A NEUROSURGEON
AND A TEST PILOT.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.896
HE'S SO SMART.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.965
HE ALWAYS KNOWS
THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

06:38.031 --> 06:42.202
OF COURSE HE DOES.
HE HAS 12 WRITERS.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.237
I THINK HE'S CUTE.

06:44.304 --> 06:46.540
I THINK HE'S SEXY.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.745
WE DON'T JUST
WATCH THIS SHOW
FOR THE LAUGHS.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.682
THERE'S ALSO
A LESSON EVERY WEEK.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.083
AND WHAT WAS
TONIGHT'S LESSON?

06:56.149 --> 06:59.620
WELL, BUDDY SHOWED US
THAT WHEN KIDS MESS UP,

06:59.687 --> 07:00.988
PARENTS SHOULD
THINK BACK

07:01.054 --> 07:04.124
AND SEE HOW
IT'S REALLY THEIR FAULT.

07:04.191 --> 07:08.295
OH, LIKE THE TIME
YOU THREW THE FOOTBALL
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.163
THAT WAS MY FAULT.

07:10.230 --> 07:13.501
HEY. WHO GAVE ME
THE FOOTBALL?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.577
HARRIET.
MM-HMM.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.613
YOU THINK THE KIDS
MIGHT LIKE ME BETTER

07:25.679 --> 07:29.382
IF I DRESSED
MORE IVY LEAGUE
LIKE BUDDY GOODRICH?

07:29.449 --> 07:31.552
CARL, YOU'RE NOT
IVY LEAGUE.

07:31.619 --> 07:35.856
YOU'RE BOWLING LEAGUE.
BUT DON'T WORRY.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.891
THE KIDS KNOW
YOU'RE A GREAT FATHER.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.459
WE ALL DO.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.761
THANKS, HARRIETTE.

07:40.828 --> 07:44.031
I BELIEVE I'LL HAVE ME
A SHOT OF MINERAL OIL,

07:44.097 --> 07:46.500
AND THEN HIT THE SACK.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.101
I'LL GET IT FOR YOU.

07:48.168 --> 07:50.571
BY THE WAY, CARL,
DID YOU GET GOOD SEATS

07:50.638 --> 07:52.773
FOR THE BUDDY GOODRICH
ONE-MAN SHOW?

07:52.840 --> 07:56.276
I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY
TO GET ANY TICKETS.

07:56.343 --> 07:57.511
WITH WHAT?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.946
NOTHING MUCH.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.314
JUST ROBBERIES,
HIGH-SPEED CHASES,
SHOOT-OUTS.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.618
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR LUNCH HOUR, HONEY?

08:04.685 --> 08:09.557
OKAY, MAMA, I'LL PICK UP
THE TICKETS TOMORROW.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.893
AND, CARL, SPRING FOR
SOME DECENT SEATS THIS TIME.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.763
YEAH. WHEN YOU TOOK US TO SEE
THE GLADYS KNIGHT SHOW,

08:15.829 --> 08:19.567
WE SAT SO FAR BACK,
I COULDN'T EVEN SEE THE PIPS.

08:31.278 --> 08:34.882
EXCUSE ME.
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO THE BOX OFFICE.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.351
THE BLACK CONVERTIBLE
IN THE HANDICAPPED SPOT--

08:38.418 --> 08:39.452
WHOSE CAR IS THAT?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.488
THAT'S
BUDDY GOODRICH'S CAR.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.190
REALLY? THAT'S HIS CAR?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.825
MM-HMM.
WOW.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.059
LISTEN,
I'M PRESSED FOR TIME.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.495
SO WOULD YOU MIND TELLING HIM
TO MOVE IT.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.765
I'M ON A BREAK.
SORRY.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.667
THAT'S HIS DRESSING ROOM
RIGHT OVER THERE.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.302
THANKS.
YEAH.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.147
CAN I HELP YOU,
OFFICER?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.982
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU

09:09.049 --> 09:11.719
BUT MR. GOODRICH'S CAR
IS PARKED IN
A HANDICAPPED SPOT.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.453
I'D APPRECIATE
SOMEBODY MOVING IT.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.157
OF COURSE.
LET ME JUST
GET THE KEYS.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.665
HEY, JACK.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.971
WOW! YOU'RE
BUDDY GOODRICH.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.873
MY FAMILY WATCHES YOU
EVERY WEEK.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.441
THEY THINK YOU'RE
THE GREATEST.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.710
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.512
GEE, YOU'RE MUCH TALLER
ON TV.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.081
THAT'S BECAUSE
ON THE SHOW,

09:41.148 --> 09:45.218
I'M ALWAYS STANDING NEXT TO
THOSE LITTLE RUNT ORPHANS.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.589
THAT IS GOOD.

09:49.657 --> 09:50.924
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.960
LISTEN, MR. GOODRICH,
AFTER YOU MOVE THE CAR,

09:53.026 --> 09:55.028
CAN I GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH
FOR MY KIDS?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.765
NOBODY MOVES THE CAR.
IT STAYS WHERE IT IS.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.067
YOU GOT THAT...

10:00.133 --> 10:02.269
OFFICER CHUBBO?

10:07.675 --> 10:10.744
YOU ARE ONE FUNNY GUY.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.480
AND ACTUALLY, THAT WOULD
BE SERGEANT CHUBBO.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.416
BUT SERIOUSLY,
MR. GOODRICH, THE CAR
HAS TO BE MOVED.

10:16.483 --> 10:20.654
SO THIS IS THE THANKS I GET
FOR DOING A CHARITY GIG.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.890
I DON'T NEED THIS.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.294
YOU KNOW,
I'M A BIG STAR.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.199
WELL, FINE.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.534
THEN HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT
MOVE THE CAR.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.103
OH, YOU DON'T GET IT.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.972
THAT HANDICAPPED SPACE
IS RIGHT BY THE STAGE DOOR.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.974
SO, WHEN I FINISH
THE SHOW,

10:41.041 --> 10:44.177
I CAN GET
OUT OF THIS DUMP
AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.412
CAPISCE?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.982
UH, LISTEN,
MR. GOODRICH,

10:49.049 --> 10:50.684
IF YOU DON'T
MOVE THE CAR,

10:50.751 --> 10:52.720
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GIVE YOU
A TICKET

10:52.786 --> 10:54.021
AND HAVE YOU
TOWED AWAY.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.423
YOU ARE GOING
TO DO WHAT?

10:56.489 --> 10:57.758
YOU HEARD ME.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.260
LOOK, YOU DON'T
SEEM TO UNDERSTAND?

11:00.327 --> 11:01.594
I'M NOT
MOVING THE CAR.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.797
AND YOU'RE NOT
GIVING ME A TICKET.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.999
AM I GETTING THROUGH?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.167
YOU KNOW,
MR. GOODRICH,

11:07.234 --> 11:09.569
YOU OUGHT NOT SHOVE
A POLICE OFFICER.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.538
OH, THAT WAS JUST
TAPPING.

11:11.604 --> 11:12.572
THIS IS SHOVING.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.008
YOU DID THAT AGAIN.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.009
YEAH.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.745
I KIND OF
ENJOYED IT.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.379
I'M NOT GOING
TO TELL YOU ANYMORE.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.816
YOU DIDN'T LIKE THAT?
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HATE THIS.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.052
MR. GOODRICH,
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST

11:25.118 --> 11:26.987
FOR ASSAULTING
A POLICE OFFICER.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.856
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.991
YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS REALLY DUMB.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.060
YOU'RE ONE
FIRST-CLASS IDIOT.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.062
OH, REALLY?
IF I'M SO DUMB,

11:35.128 --> 11:37.130
HOW COME YOU'RE ONE
WEARING THE CUFFS?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.966
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY

11:39.032 --> 11:41.168
AND TO HAVE ONE
PRESENT DURING
QUESTIONING.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.179
OH.
HI, EVERYBODY.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.015
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL HOME.
I GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.084
NOT NOW, CARL.
WE'RE WATCHING THE NEWS.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.051
DID YOU HEAR?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.754
SOME WACKO COP
ARRESTED BUDDY GOODRICH.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.455
WELL...

12:02.522 --> 12:04.157
I'D LIKE TO
TALK ABOUT THAT.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.159
QUIET, CARL.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.897
NO, NO, I'M STILL PERFORMING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

12:09.963 --> 12:12.465
OF COURSE AFTER THE WAY
I WAS ROUGHED UP

12:12.532 --> 12:16.269
THE NEXT TIME I'LL REMEMBER
TO BRING A STUNT MAN.

12:20.207 --> 12:25.378
OH, WHAT A GUY. HE COULD STILL
LAUGH AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.514
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO BUDDY GOODRICH.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.884
CARL, PLEASE, WE'D RATHER HEAR
IT FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS THERE.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.389
NO, I DON'T KNOW WHY
THIS OFFICER ATTACKED ME.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.158
BUT MY ASSISTANT ROGER
WILL VERIFY

12:38.225 --> 12:40.493
THAT IT WAS
TOTALLY UNPROVOKED.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.095
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

12:42.162 --> 12:44.531
THAT I DON'T BLAME
THE CITY

12:44.597 --> 12:46.967
OR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.837
THERE'S ONLY PERSON
THAT I HOLD RESPONSIBLE.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.905
ONE BAD APPLE.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.909
ONE ROGUE COP--

12:55.976 --> 12:58.511
OFFICER CARL WINSLOW.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.486
IT WAS YOU?

13:06.553 --> 13:09.122
YOU ARRESTED
BUDDY GOODRICH?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.423
WELL...

13:10.490 --> 13:11.624
YEAH!

13:11.691 --> 13:14.094
WAY TO GO, CARL.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.741
YOU ARRESTED
AMERICA'S FAVORITE DAD?

13:28.808 --> 13:31.178
HOW COULD YOU DO
THIS TO ME?

13:31.244 --> 13:32.345
TO YOU?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.814
CARL, I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
ARRESTED THE MAN

13:34.882 --> 13:36.449
UNLESS YOU HAD
A GOOD REASON.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.986
I WANNA HEAR THIS.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.721
LOOK. I POLITELY ASKED
THE MAN

13:41.788 --> 13:43.957
TO MOVE HIS CAR
OUT OF A HANDICAPPED SPOT.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.693
BUT HE WENT CRAZY.
HE TOOK A SWING AT ME.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.428
THAT'S IT?

13:49.729 --> 13:51.298
THAT'S PLENTY.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.733
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE
THE MAN IS NICE ON TV

13:53.800 --> 13:56.003
DOES NOT MEAN THAT
HE'S NICE IN PERSON.

13:56.069 --> 13:59.907
DAD, YOU BUSTED
THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN AMERICA.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.009
I SAY WE MOVE.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.777
YEAH.
LET'S MOVE TO CANADA.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.179
I'M WITH YOU.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.349
ALRIGHT. I DIDN'T EXPECT
THE KIDS TO UNDERSTAND,

14:09.416 --> 14:11.384
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
MAMA, DON'T YOU?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.954
OH. YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.157
YOU'RE IN A TIGHT SPOT
AND YOU'RE CHOKED.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.426
OKAY, MAMA.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.562
WE BELIEVE YOU, CARL.
DON'T WE, RACHEL?

14:22.629 --> 14:25.198
OF COURSE, WE DO.
CARL, I LOVE YOU.

14:25.265 --> 14:28.368
YOU'RE MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.
WHY WOULDN'T I BELIEVE YOU?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.138
OF COURSE, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
BUDDY GOODRICH'S BIGGEST FAN AND

14:31.204 --> 14:33.974
MAYBE YOU WENT DOWN THERE
WITH A CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER

14:34.041 --> 14:37.010
BUT BASICALLY,
I BELIEVE YOU.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.611
MORE OR LESS.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.916
OH, CARL, DID YOU
SEE THE PAPER?

15:16.984 --> 15:18.185
[MUMBLING]

15:18.251 --> 15:20.220
IT WASN'T A VERY
GOOD PICTURE OF YOU,

15:20.287 --> 15:23.056
BUT IT WASN'T A GOOD REASON
TO BE IN THE PAPER.

15:23.123 --> 15:26.960
BUT HEY, FRONT PAGE!

15:27.794 --> 15:29.362
ARE WE GOING TO
EAT SOON?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.430
[DOORBELL RINGS]

15:30.497 --> 15:31.999
I'LL GET IT.

15:36.569 --> 15:37.537
HELLO.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.072
IT'S BUDDY GOODRICH!

15:39.139 --> 15:42.976
IS THIS
THE WINSLOW RESIDENCE?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.578
YES!

15:45.645 --> 15:49.382
MAY I COME IN?

15:49.449 --> 15:50.750
YES!

15:50.817 --> 15:53.053
THANK YOU.
I'M, UH...

15:53.120 --> 15:54.287
BUDDY GOODRICH.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.058
AND YOU ARE?

15:58.925 --> 16:00.293
I'M HARRIETTE WINSLOW,

16:00.360 --> 16:02.229
AND THESE ARE MY CHILDREN--

16:02.295 --> 16:03.896
EDDIE, LAURA,
AND JUDY WINSLOW.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
AND THAT'S MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
MRS. WINSLOW,

16:06.033 --> 16:09.036
AND I THINK
YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND, CARL.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.770
WE'VE MET.

16:10.837 --> 16:14.074
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL
FAMILY, CARL.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.143
CARL, HOW CAN YOU
ARREST A MAN

16:16.209 --> 16:19.446
WHO SAYS YOU'VE
GOT A BEAUTIFUL
FAMILY?

16:19.512 --> 16:22.082
I JUST CAME OVER
TO SAY HOW SORRY I AM

16:22.149 --> 16:23.116
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.918
AND AS A TOKEN
OF MY FEELINGS,

16:25.985 --> 16:28.255
I BROUGHT SOME TICKETS
TO MY SHOW TONIGHT.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.624
UH-UH. I'M SORRY,
MR. GOODRICH.

16:31.691 --> 16:32.759
BUT, DAD--

16:32.825 --> 16:33.960
WE CAN'T MAKE IT.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.028
OH, MY.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.196
COME ON!

16:36.263 --> 16:38.898
NOW, NOW.
IF THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS,

16:38.965 --> 16:40.867
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.802
SHOW HIM RESPECT.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.505
HE'S YOUR FATHER.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.607
THANK YOU, MR. GOODRICH.
THANK YOU.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.043
WELL, I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.079
WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS
GETS INTO THE PRESS,

16:52.145 --> 16:55.615
WELL, THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW THEY'LL BLOW IT UP.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.717
HI! I'M RACHEL!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.687
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU...

17:00.753 --> 17:02.089
AGAIN.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.991
YOU KNOW,
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE

17:05.058 --> 17:06.926
HOW PROUD
YOU MUST BE OF CARL.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.129
HE HAS A VERY DIF--

17:10.130 --> 17:12.365
HE HAS A VERY
DIFFICULT JOB,

17:12.432 --> 17:14.567
AND HE DOES IT
SO WELL.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.003
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU,
TO SAY, MR. GOODRICH.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.471
THANK YOU.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.074
I'VE ALWAYS SAID WHAT
SEPARATES US FROM ANIMALS

17:21.141 --> 17:22.609
IS WE HAVE THE ABILITY

17:22.675 --> 17:26.179
TO SETTLE OUR DIFFERENCES
PEACEFULLY.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.980
WELL, THAT AND...

17:28.047 --> 17:30.783
WE KNOW HOW TO USE
CHOPSTICKS.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.622
OH, HE'S WONDERFUL.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.857
HE KILLS ME.

17:37.924 --> 17:39.492
SO, UH, CARL,

17:39.559 --> 17:41.961
DO YOU THINK WE
COULD SPEAK PRIVATELY?

17:42.028 --> 17:43.630
IT'LL JUST
TAKE A MINUTE.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.232
WELL, I...

17:46.299 --> 17:49.236
OKAY. WE CAN GO
TALK IN THE KITCHEN.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.011
"ROW A."

17:59.078 --> 18:00.680
WHOO!

18:00.747 --> 18:02.215
IS THAT GOOD?

18:05.017 --> 18:08.155
THANKS FOR
SPEAKING WITH ME.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.322
WELL, I, UH...

18:09.389 --> 18:11.858
I APPRECIATE WHAT
YOU SAID IN THERE.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.594
IT'S ALL TRUE.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.031
CARL, LOOK.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.068
I'D LIKE TO SOLVE
OUR LITTLE PROBLEM
BEFORE I LEAVE TOWN.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.371
ISN'T THERE
SOMETHING WE CAN DO?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.439
SURE. YOU COULD
TELL THE TRUTH,

18:26.506 --> 18:28.908
PLEAD GUILTY,
AND PAY YOUR FINE.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.010
YEAH.
THAT'S AN OPTION.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.712
NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.314
IT'S THE BEST
I CAN DO.

18:34.381 --> 18:36.449
DON'T BE SO HASTY.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.118
THIS WILL BE
A VERY TOUGH CASE
FOR YOU TO WIN.

18:39.186 --> 18:43.223
I KNOW. I DATE ONE OF
THE ACTRESSES ON
L.A. LAW.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.393
WELL, YOU MAY BE RIGHT,
MR. GOODRICH,

18:46.459 --> 18:48.661
BUT I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

18:48.728 --> 18:53.032
CARL, DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO TAKE ON
AMERICA'S FAVORITE DAD

18:53.099 --> 18:55.302
IN FRONT OF A JURY?

18:55.368 --> 18:59.406
MR. GOODRICH, WOULD YOU
GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE ON THIS?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.241
OKAY

19:01.308 --> 19:03.710
I WANT YOU
TO COME BACKSTAGE
AFTER MY SHOW

19:03.776 --> 19:06.679
FOR A PRESS CONFERENCE.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.215
YOU CHANGE YOUR STORY,

19:08.281 --> 19:10.883
I'LL PRAISE YOU
AS A DEDICATED
PUBLIC SERVANT,

19:10.950 --> 19:14.053
AND WE BOTH LOOK GOOD.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.088
I CAN'T DO THAT,
MR. GOODRICH.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.259
YOU SEE, YOU ASSAULTED
A POLICE OFFICER.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.294
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
MY ASSISTANT WILL SAY

19:21.361 --> 19:22.629
ON THE WITNESS STAND.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.697
HE'LL SAY HE SAW
THE WHOLE THING,

19:24.764 --> 19:26.766
AND YOU STARTED IT.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.568
OH, I SEE.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.838
SO WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE HIM DO IS LIE.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.306
COMMIT PERJURY.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.509
THOSE ARE SUCH
UGLY WORDS, CARL.

19:36.576 --> 19:40.247
THEY'RE TRUE, BUT STILL,
THEY'RE VERY UGLY.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.349
I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.583
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.

19:43.650 --> 19:47.487
OH, CARL, DON'T BE
SO SHORT-SIGHTED.

19:47.554 --> 19:51.224
LOOK, I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.294
JUST PITCHING HERE,
BUT, UM...

19:54.361 --> 19:57.129
WHAT IF WE DO
AN EPISODE ON MY SHOW

19:57.196 --> 19:58.398
ABOUT OUR
LITTLE INCIDENT?

19:58.465 --> 20:00.733
AND I HIRE YOU
AS A TECHNICAL ADVISOR

20:00.800 --> 20:03.503
FOR A FEE OF, UH...

20:03.570 --> 20:05.004
$2,000?

20:05.071 --> 20:06.806
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

20:06.873 --> 20:08.875
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
OFFERING ME A BRIBE.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.678
OHH! BRIBE!

20:11.744 --> 20:13.813
ANOTHER UGLY WORD.

20:14.681 --> 20:17.484
CARL!

20:17.550 --> 20:20.086
I AM TRYING TO DO YOU
A FAVOR.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.822
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

20:22.889 --> 20:26.693
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT MY PROBLEM IS,
MR. GOODRICH.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.161
I CAN'T SHAVE
WITH MY EYES CLOSED.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.930
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:30.997 --> 20:34.901
IT MEANS THAT I HAVE TO
LOOK AT MYSELF EVERY DAY
IN THE MIRROR.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.770
SURE, I'D LIKE TO
GET THIS THING OVER WITH,

20:37.837 --> 20:39.972
BUT IF I GAVE IN TO YOU,

20:40.039 --> 20:42.975
I COULDN'T FACE MYSELF.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.912
I COULDN'T
FACE MY KIDS EITHER.

20:45.978 --> 20:47.647
YOU SEE, MR. GOODRICH,

20:47.714 --> 20:51.150
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED
TO TEACH THEM
RIGHT FROM WRONG.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.685
I'M A GOOD FATHER

20:52.752 --> 20:54.321
AND A GOOD COP.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.556
I DON'T BACK DOWN
WHEN I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.392
AND I DON'T
TAKE BRIBES FROM
THE LIKES OF YOU.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.594
NOW, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.266
OKAY

21:07.334 --> 21:08.868
$3,000.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.374
GET OUT, NOW.

21:14.441 --> 21:17.644
OKAY, BUT YOU ARE
MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.980
I AM GOING TO
BURY YOU IN COURT.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.615
HEY!

21:22.682 --> 21:24.317
EVERYBODY!

21:27.253 --> 21:30.089
UM, RACHEL, RIGHT?

21:30.156 --> 21:31.491
RIGHT.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.495
WELL, UH...

21:35.562 --> 21:37.697
GOT TO RUN.
HA HA HA.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.366
EXCUSE ME.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.169
IT WAS VERY NICE
MEETING EVERYONE.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.772
THE PLEASURE
WAS ALL YOURS.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.310
THAT'S GOOD.

21:51.378 --> 21:53.746
SO, UH, REALLY--
I REALLY DO HAVE TO RUN.

21:53.813 --> 21:54.581
MR. GOODRICH.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.115
UH, YOU
FORGOT SOMETHING.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.385
WE WON'T BE NEEDING
THESE TICKETS.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.658
YOU KNOW--

22:05.725 --> 22:06.793
YES!
YAY!

22:06.859 --> 22:08.361
YOU KNOW YOU GOT IT!

22:08.428 --> 22:11.864
CARL, I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU, SON.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.800
THAT IS MY SON!

22:13.866 --> 22:15.502
YOU TOLD HIM GOOD.

22:19.205 --> 22:22.208
I SURE HOPE THIS IS THE LAST DAY
OF THAT GOODRICH TRIAL.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.044
THESE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE
BEEN SO TOUGH ON CARL.

22:25.111 --> 22:30.016
YEAH. I HATE THE WAY HE LOOKS
IN THOSE COURT ROOM SKETCHES.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.389
HI, EVERYBODY.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.424
YOU'RE BACK.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.025
HOW DID THE TRIAL GO?

22:39.091 --> 22:40.059
IT'S OVER.

22:40.126 --> 22:44.464
THEY FOUND HIM GUILTY.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.499
GOODRICH'S ASSISTANT
BROKE DOWN ON THE WITNESS STAND

22:46.566 --> 22:48.134
AND TOLD THE TRUTH.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.102
GOODRICH FIRED HIM
ON THE SPOT.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.338
AND THEN HE PUNCHEDOUT
HIS LAWYER.

22:52.405 --> 22:53.740
IS HE GOING
TO JAIL?

22:53.806 --> 22:55.575
NO.
HE HAS TO PAY A BIG FINE

22:55.642 --> 22:59.278
AND SPEND 100 HOURS
PICKING UP TRASH
ALONG THE INTERSTATE.

22:59.345 --> 23:01.147
A BIG STAR
PICKING UP GARBAGE.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.281
HONEY, I LOVE IT!

23:02.348 --> 23:04.584
NOW, RACHEL,
THAT'S NOT NICE.

23:04.651 --> 23:09.656
MAMA'S RIGHT, RACHEL.
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE PLEASURE
IN SOMEONE'S MISERY.

23:09.722 --> 23:13.426
ANYBODY FOR
A SLOW DRIVE ALONG
THE INTERSTATE?

23:13.493 --> 23:16.062
I'LL GET THE CAMERA.
THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT!
