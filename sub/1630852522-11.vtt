Mary: Sports day today!
You better fuel up, huh?

00:03.170 --> 00:04.836
<i> Adult mark: Sports day.</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:06.305
<i> The worst day of the year</i>
<i> for a wimp -</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:08.306
<i> An all-day gym class.</i>

00:08.342 --> 00:10.576
- I can't eat. The thought
of the whole school

00:10.578 --> 00:12.377
Seeing me collapse
in a potato sack

00:12.380 --> 00:14.112
Is giving my butterflies
caterpillars.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.314
- Oh... Now, don't ya worry,
mark.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.149
We don't expect you to win
a bunch of ribbons

00:18.185 --> 00:19.785
Like your brother.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.654
We know you're not gonna win
anything. Just have fun.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.523
<i> Adult mark: Such confidence</i>
<i> in me.</i>

00:24.525 --> 00:26.024
- Hmm.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.526
<i> Adult mark: I was not athletic</i>
<i> but, in fairness,</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.127
<i> I didn't have</i>
<i> the best teachers.</i>

00:29.196 --> 00:31.196
- No shame in losing, son.
[kettle whistles]

00:31.198 --> 00:33.231
<i> Pop: Kettle's boiled.</i>
<i> - I got it.</i>

00:33.233 --> 00:34.866
- Mike, luv, I'm sorry,

00:34.935 --> 00:36.335
But I can't give you
a driving lesson today.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.903
- What? Why?
- [sighs] your father and I

00:38.939 --> 00:41.239
Agreed to volunteer
for sports day.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.208
- What?
- My driving test is on Monday!

00:43.210 --> 00:45.009
I have no idea how
to parallel park!

00:45.046 --> 00:46.678
Somebody has gotta take me!

00:46.714 --> 00:50.249
- Uh, I'll take you.
- Oh no, that's you won't.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.018
You don't have a licence!
- I drive all the time.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.553
- You haven't driven
since confederation.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.821
- Driving a car's
like ridin' a bike!

00:56.823 --> 00:59.925
- Uh, no offense, pop, but...

00:59.927 --> 01:01.359
I think you're too old
to drive.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.394
<i> Mary: Oh, sweet jesus, no.</i>
<i> [kettle clangs lightly]</i>

01:06.900 --> 01:08.533
- Oh, too old, am I?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.503
Well, you might be surprised
to know

01:11.505 --> 01:15.707
That I'm still spry enough
to turn the... Whatchamacallit.

01:15.709 --> 01:19.244
The... You know, the round thing
with the barmy part.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.045
- The steering wheel?
- Yes!

01:21.082 --> 01:23.515
That's exactly what it is!

01:23.551 --> 01:26.952
Steering wheel, yeah.
Well, that was a test,

01:26.954 --> 01:30.789
And you, young man,
are ready for a lesson.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.190
Mike sr.: [mouthing]
no, you can't go.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.459
<i> [fridge items rattle]</i>

01:34.461 --> 01:36.328
- You know what, pop? I don't
think I actually need to know

01:36.397 --> 01:38.330
How to park, so uh...
You're off the hook.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.632
- Dammit! I'm giving you
a lesson!

01:40.634 --> 01:42.700
I'm not too old to drive!

01:43.904 --> 01:45.337
[liquid pours]

01:45.406 --> 01:47.372
Mary: Pop?
- What?!

01:47.408 --> 01:49.508
- That's orange juice.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.243
- Yeah. So?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.980
That's what I want.
Vitamin c.

01:57.684 --> 01:59.484
It's good for gout.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.889
[sips tea]

02:03.958 --> 02:05.223
Hmm.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.662
Mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm. Mmm!

02:12.566 --> 02:14.566
Mmm, mmm.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.968
[loud gulp,
clears his throat]

02:18.439 --> 02:21.173
Don't you laugh.
I'll see you in the car.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.841
<i>Adult mark: I was going to be</i>
<i> humiliated</i>

02:22.843 --> 02:24.976
<i>In front of the whole school,</i>
<i> but it could be worse.</i>

<i> [birds chirp]</i>

02:32.720 --> 02:35.120
<i> Adult mark: All the parents</i>
<i> came out on sports day.</i>

02:35.189 --> 02:36.854
<i> Many were excited to see</i>
<i> their kids,</i>

02:36.891 --> 02:38.523
<i> Who failed the rest</i>
<i> of the year,</i>

02:38.526 --> 02:41.626
<i>Redeem themselves with ribbons.</i>

02:41.695 --> 02:44.129
<i> And then there were mine.</i>
<i> [car door slams shut]</i>

02:44.198 --> 02:45.597
- Are you sure you both
have to come?

02:45.732 --> 02:48.467
- [sighs] we got stuck
volunteering, to be honest.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.670
Mrs. Perez is like a vampire.
Just 'cause she got bit,

02:51.672 --> 02:54.406
She's trying to damn
as many souls as she can.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.441
Mrs. Perez: [shouting]
did you bring any food?

02:57.878 --> 03:01.312
[whispers] I didn't bring
any food.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.749
Fox: Mom? Mom?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.418
- [low groan]

03:06.420 --> 03:08.587
- Aren't you comin'?

03:08.589 --> 03:11.155
- Oh, I can watch ya from here,
sure.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.891
- Please?
- Ugh...

03:12.893 --> 03:15.027
- All the other parents
actually got out of their cars.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.029
- Oh, that's just what I needs
now, right?

03:17.031 --> 03:18.963
To be hangin' out
with the other parents.

03:18.965 --> 03:20.632
- Mom, come on!

03:20.701 --> 03:22.100
I'm gonna break
the school record.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.970
I'm gonna get all gold,
I promise!

03:25.105 --> 03:27.639
Woman: Sarah?!
- Please?

03:27.675 --> 03:30.642
Woman: Sarah!
- Okay! I'm comin'!

03:31.879 --> 03:33.645
<i> Sister margaret: All right</i>
<i> then. Uh... Mrs. Critch,</i>

03:33.681 --> 03:36.582
I have you and mrs. Perez
at the refreshments station.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.784
- Ooh... Exciting.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.253
<i> - Mr. Perez, I hear you work</i>
<i> at the hospital.</i>

03:41.255 --> 03:42.987
You'll run the first-aid tent.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.724
- Oh no, no,
I'm just a technician.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.126
I fix the machines, that's all.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.428
- Hmm. Modesty is a virtue.
- Uh, but--

03:50.464 --> 03:52.697
- Mr. Critch,
I'll have you run the pa.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.532
How does that sound?
- Ha!

03:54.568 --> 03:57.368
Well, I'm more hard news
than sports, sister.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.739
Uh, yes, sister.
Thank you, sister.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.541
Sorry, sister.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.175
[indistinct chatter]

04:05.479 --> 04:07.211
- Surprised to see you.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.848
Thought for sure you'd get off
with so many health conditions.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.983
- Enh. At least we're in this
together.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.818
What shall we lose at first?
Long jump?

04:13.887 --> 04:17.088
- Sorry, I got out of it.

04:17.157 --> 04:18.556
- What?

04:18.558 --> 04:20.458
- I'm helping my dad
in the first-aid tent.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.327
- [sighs] you gotta get me
in there.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.763
- Not without an injury.
But don't worry,

04:24.765 --> 04:26.364
I'm sure you'll hurt yourself.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.834
Kids: [indistinct chatter]

04:28.836 --> 04:31.436
- Ooh. I see your mom's here.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.072
- Yeah. Why wouldn't she be,
dork?

04:34.141 --> 04:36.274
- I was just making small talk.
I... Didn't...

04:36.310 --> 04:38.376
She seems lovely.
[pa system squawks]

04:38.445 --> 04:40.244
<i> - Mike critch,</i>
<i> reporting field-side</i>

04:40.281 --> 04:41.446
<i> At st. Bridget's sports day.</i>

04:41.482 --> 04:44.116
We now go live to sister rose.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.851
[low mic feedback]

04:47.921 --> 04:51.189
- When we think of sport,
children,

04:51.191 --> 04:53.324
We must remember
the ancient romans

04:53.360 --> 04:56.328
<i> Had a sports day too.</i>
<i> [bunting flutters]</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:59.197
Theirs was held
in the colosseum.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.202
<i> When they threw st. Ignatius</i>
<i> to the lions, he exclaimed,</i>

05:04.204 --> 05:07.706
<i> "I am as grain of the field</i>

05:07.775 --> 05:10.342
And must be ground by the teeth
of the lions,

05:10.344 --> 05:13.578
That I may become fit
to sit at his table."

05:14.648 --> 05:18.083
So, today,
have fun on this field.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.854
Win your ribbons.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.558
But when you pin them
to your chests,

05:26.560 --> 05:28.960
Remember the rivers of blood

05:29.096 --> 05:30.896
<i> That once flowed</i>
<i> from the chests</i>

05:31.031 --> 05:33.198
Of the early christians,

05:33.200 --> 05:35.300
Which stained the sand

05:35.369 --> 05:38.303
Within that roman colosseum.

05:40.907 --> 05:43.041
Father?
[mic rustles]

05:43.176 --> 05:45.276
Father handrigan: Let the games
begin!

05:45.346 --> 05:48.914
<i> Mr. Byrne: [clears throat]</i>
<i> kids: [cheering]</i>

05:49.049 --> 05:51.215
- All right, people, listen up.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.484
<i> Here is how the day</i>
<i> will be ranked.</i>

05:53.520 --> 05:55.520
Gold for excellence,

05:55.522 --> 05:57.321
<i> Silver for losers,</i>

05:57.358 --> 06:00.125
And bronze for the also-rans.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.994
<i> And finally,</i>
<i> the participation ribbon</i>

06:03.063 --> 06:05.163
<i> Which says you may</i>
<i> have showed up,</i>

06:05.232 --> 06:07.666
But you didn't "show up."
- I'll take it.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.001
<i> - In 1965,</i>

06:10.003 --> 06:13.204
I achieved personal excellence

06:13.240 --> 06:16.942
By winning five gold ribbons.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.277
That is a st. Bridget's record

06:19.279 --> 06:22.080
That stands to this very day.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.348
Like me, it is unbreakable.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.019
- I'm gonna break that
scumbag's record.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.221
<i> Mr. Byrne: Ready... Break!</i>

Mark: Hopefully.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.898
[horn blasts]
- ah! Horn works, that's good.

06:39.900 --> 06:43.702
Oh... No gloves in the glove
box. That's bad.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.571
Now, the first thing
you're gonna wanna do

06:46.573 --> 06:48.907
Is toggle your gauges,

06:48.909 --> 06:51.242
Adjust your seat, and uh...

06:51.278 --> 06:53.845
You just make sure you've got
plenty of room in the ashtray.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.713

06:55.783 --> 06:58.082
But are we actually gonna
drive?

06:58.152 --> 07:00.218
- Slow down, b'y.
We're gettin' there.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.254
- [sighs heavily] pop,
we've been here forever.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.355
Please, just get onto the road.

07:04.391 --> 07:07.058
- Look, the key is looking
both ways

07:07.060 --> 07:08.760
And then, behind you.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.195
[car idles]

07:10.264 --> 07:12.063
- There's no one behind us!

07:12.132 --> 07:14.198
We are in an empty parking lot!

07:14.234 --> 07:15.934
Please, pop,
let me take the wheel.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.068
You're too old to drive.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.101
For the arm hang.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.303
For girls.

The boys record is...
30 seconds longer,

And that is a record I hold
to this very day.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.112
- What?!
I could have beaten that!

08:01.114 --> 08:02.780
You told me to let go!

08:02.816 --> 08:05.317
- Boys and girls have different
physical thresholds.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.385
There has to be
a natural order, 'kay?

08:08.889 --> 08:10.722

- Your daughter's doing
very well!

08:35.349 --> 08:37.549
- Yeah! Oh, she's great
at sports.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.317

the clock on me!

Well, sure, it's just sports.

I just don't want you gettin'
a big head on ya, that's all.
