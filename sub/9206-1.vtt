01:25.586 --> 01:27.588
Hit me.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.759
I'm serious, I can't feel anything. Hit me!

01:33.510 --> 01:36.480
Again! Do it harder!

01:38.640 --> 01:42.736
I can't feel anything!
This is awesome.

01:45.230 --> 01:49.736
I hear this little "wah, wah, wah"
inside my head.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.742
That's your brain cells popping.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.334
- Do it!
- You want me to do it?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.754
Hit me! Harder! Punch me!

02:16.053 --> 02:17.805
Hit me really hard. Really.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.516
- Okay, I'm gonna punch you.
- Okay, go!

02:22.684 --> 02:24.561
Oh, shit!

02:26.730 --> 02:28.027
Yeah!

02:41.244 --> 02:43.042
Come on, Hampton.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.258
Come on.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.396
Come on, baby.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.150
Mom! Come on! It's 7:45.
Let's go. Let's go.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.686
I'm ready. Hey, Noel.

03:05.894 --> 03:08.363
- Mason, come on!
- Come on, Mason!

03:08.522 --> 03:11.366
- Where's the new backpack?
- Already in the back seat.

03:11.525 --> 03:15.405
Let me fix this before somebody
gives you the wedgie from hell.

03:15.612 --> 03:16.864
- Mason!
- Come on!

03:17.030 --> 03:19.374
What's up, guys? Hey, Noel.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.635
Bitch.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.546
What the hell?

03:34.548 --> 03:37.802
- You're not allowed to wear that.
- Teachers look mean here.

03:38.009 --> 03:42.185
Well, I promised myself I wouldn't get
anything lower than an A. Careful!

03:42.431 --> 03:44.183
God.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.935
How you doing, man?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.028
Guess what just happened.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.655
Dude! Look at that shit! Damn.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.649
- That shit is tight!
- Mason.

03:52.774 --> 03:55.493
Hey. Guys, this is my little sister.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.531
- Hi.
- Look over there, man.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.242
- There's Evie Zamora.
- She grew up this summer.

04:01.408 --> 04:05.163
- No shit.
- Hey, Evie. What's up, girl?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.164
- Let's go say hi.
- Be cool, dude.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.007
What's up, Evie?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.794
- Come here, I wanna talk to you.
- You see that?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.603
Shit.

04:23.138 --> 04:26.483
Now look up at me. Looks great.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.770
Yeah. Next time we'll do orange.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.193
(Hair gel, bah)”

04:43.366 --> 04:48.463
It's okay, Mom.
You can borrow mine. Again.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.127
Thank you.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.130
Rodney, I love the blue.

04:52.334 --> 04:54.883
Hey, go like this.

04:55.587 --> 04:58.636
You guys hungry?
I did Italian tonight.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.227
Hey, it's hot, guys.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.730
Where'd you put the cheese?

05:06.890 --> 05:09.393
Bye! Don't burn your tongue!

05:09.643 --> 05:10.895
- Bye, Mel.
- Oh, thanks.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.865
So long. Jesus, $2 tip?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.983
They ate half the lasagna.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.736
Mom, you're way too generous.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.864
Dad send the check this month?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.833
Lay off him, Tracy.
He just started the new job.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.745
We're fine, hon. I'm hooked all week.

05:29.496 --> 05:33.876
You'd look great with some honey-blond
entertainment streaks...

05:34.334 --> 05:36.132
...right here.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.216
It's not fair. I can't be mad
at you when you do that.

05:43.009 --> 05:45.137
Here, Mom, listen to this.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.892
<i>He was crippled
But only his body was cracked.</i>

05:50.475 --> 05:51.897
<i>Tracy!</i>

05:52.102 --> 05:53.479
- Hey.
- Hey, Kayla.

05:53.645 --> 05:57.115
Hi. The bus never came, and then it did.

05:57.232 --> 06:00.361
I have to pee,
and she hasn't eaten anything.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.739
Well, that's okay.
There's some stuff on the stove.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.496
- Okay, then we'll go?
- Tracy, I'm sorry.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.375
I just haven't been to a meeting
all week and you know I need to go.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.465
I really wanna hear your poem.
Come on.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.755
- Please start over?
- It's okay, Mom.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.132
No, please. I really wanna hear it.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.264
<i>He was crippled
But only his body was cracked.</i>

06:25.510 --> 06:29.356
<i>It's not simple
Nor is it an easy matter to explain.</i>

06:29.514 --> 06:31.642
<i>"Let's just leave it at that," she says.</i>

06:31.850 --> 06:35.024
<i>And closes the holy book of lies
She covers her eyes.</i>

06:35.228 --> 06:38.232
<i>Denying to herself
What she thought happened.</i>

06:48.325 --> 06:50.453
That's really heavy.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.215
And it scares me a little bit.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.375
It's beautiful.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.471
We gotta talk about it
when I get back, okay?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.716
Can we have some of this cake?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.969
Oh, no, no, no! Shit!

07:07.093 --> 07:10.643
That's Mario's cake!
He's 12 years sober!

07:10.889 --> 07:13.267
- Tracy, I want a piggyback ride!
- Hang on.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.024
Mom? Mom, Mom, Mom!

07:16.144 --> 07:19.819
I told you I can't babysit.
I have an I-Search project due tomorrow.

07:19.981 --> 07:24.111
Baby, baby, cut me a break! You know
I need to go! "Keep coming back!"

07:24.319 --> 07:26.822
- "It works if you work it!"
- Right, baby?

07:27.489 --> 07:28.866
- Mom...
- Bye, Mommy.

07:28.990 --> 07:32.995
- Be good!
- Yeah. Thanks again!

07:37.248 --> 07:39.250
Evie Zamora. Hey, girl.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.004
Evie Zamora has really pretty skin.

07:42.253 --> 07:46.133
I heard she has a huge scar from when
she saved her brother from a fire.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.886
You guys, she's not Wonder woman.

07:50.887 --> 07:54.107
- You guys, I'm wearing lip gloss!
- I'll see you guys later.

07:55.517 --> 07:59.317
He's so smart too. He knows German.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.357
Nice socks.

08:06.361 --> 08:09.581
Who let her out of the cabbage patch?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.557
Thank God you're cleaning
up your room.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.315
You hungry, baby?

08:39.644 --> 08:41.442
I'm not your baby.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.615
<i>Okay -</i>

08:51.281 --> 08:54.535
- Hey, what's wrong with those socks?
- Nothing.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.912
Then what are they
doing in the trash?

08:57.120 --> 09:00.420
I'm not going to wear them anymore.
I need new clothes.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.920
- How come?
- Because I look stupid! Hello?!

09:07.881 --> 09:09.758
Sylvia!

09:10.133 --> 09:12.636
Sylvia! Stop!

09:12.761 --> 09:16.186
Please! Emergency!

09:17.057 --> 09:19.651
Mom. This one's okay. This is cool.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.688
Yes. Mother scores.

09:25.356 --> 09:30.032
Now I know I have another dollar
in quarters here somewhere.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.867
Hey! Is this enough?
I could rinse these off.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.501
Right on.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.163
For the project, I'm doing J. Lo.
What about you?

09:40.288 --> 09:42.916
- I'm doing Usher.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.668
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.677
Cute shirt.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.513
Thanks. Cute belt.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.655
Call me after school.
We can go shopping on Melrose.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.532
<i>Okay -</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:19.665
Write your number on this.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.188
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

10:46.980 --> 10:48.402
You get it?

10:48.523 --> 10:51.743
Yeah, I have heard that one.
Yeah, that one': Good.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.279
Damn. I have gymnastics today.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.739
<i>- Oh, okay.
- Okay .</i>

10:55.905 --> 10:58.158
- I'll see you later.
- I'll call you later.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.539
- Bye. Love you. 'Bye.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.248
I don't know. I just wish
she liked me, you know?

11:04.414 --> 11:05.757
- I've been there.
- Tracy!

11:05.915 --> 11:08.759
Mom says to clean your room
before she gets home.

11:24.392 --> 11:28.989
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time. Please...</i>

11:42.994 --> 11:46.669
<i>The number you have reached is not
in service at this time.</i>

12:01.512 --> 12:03.640
What happened over here,
Cockroachio?

12:03.806 --> 12:05.808
Nothing, Lifeguard Boy.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.436
Hey, come clean this shit up, Trace.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.922
The pants without the pockets
make you have a better ass.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.301
Tried calling you guys,
but I was coming here anyway.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.513
My phone didn't ring.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.442
<i>Ban appétit, darling.</i>

13:33.604 --> 13:37.029
Shit. You guys, I only brought 10 bucks.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.530
What?

13:56.127 --> 13:58.880
I'm gonna go get a drink of water.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.428
Loser.

14:07.263 --> 14:11.143
What? What are you talking about? No!
No... Hang on one second.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.779
The number for you. It's right...
Hang on one second.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.408
I shouldn't be giving you the number,
you should have it. No.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.404
His name is Alberto. I don't know,
it's something, some sort of...

14:22.612 --> 14:25.912
...5-5-3 number, or Alberto,
I don't know. Something.

14:26.157 --> 14:29.627
No. You just keep in mind
that you work for me!

14:29.786 --> 14:32.790
I have 35 people coming tonight.
This is unacceptable!

14:32.914 --> 14:36.168
I need the heater working.
I have to have everything there.

14:36.376 --> 14:42.554
No, this is not right. Let's see,
hang on one second. It's 5-5-3...

14:43.549 --> 14:46.678
- Not bad for 30 minutes.
- Sales clerks didn't see shit.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.430
You guys.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.682
- You guys!
- Check this out. Watch.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.776
You guys, I totally just stole this.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.563
- No fucking way.
- From this lady over there.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.403
- Let's see how much.
- Have you seen what's in it?

14:59.524 --> 15:02.152
- Holy shit, you guys.
- Oh, my God.

15:02.276 --> 15:05.280
- I've never seen this much money.
- Let's go shopping!

15:05.488 --> 15:07.411
Hell, yeah!

15:15.039 --> 15:16.541
A few pairs of these.

15:16.791 --> 15:19.010
That should cover that.
Keep the change.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.763
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.181
Hey, Mason.

15:32.306 --> 15:37.688
Just out of curiosity, who do you think
is the hottest girl in school?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.656
I guess Evie Zamora.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.652
Guess who I hung out with today.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.747
Bull.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.163
Melrose Avenue.

15:54.745 --> 15:58.295
What? God, it's that hard to believe?

16:03.504 --> 16:06.178
Mom, why are there four places tonight?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.055
Mom?

16:14.765 --> 16:17.689
Honey, he just got back.
He's only coming for dinner.

16:17.894 --> 16:21.524
Yeah, tomorrow he's just gonna
tune up your car, right?

16:23.524 --> 16:25.276
It needs it.

16:26.360 --> 16:29.034
Why are you doing this to yourself?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.302
You mind if I put this stuff
in your garage?

17:10.738 --> 17:13.708
So, Brady, how was the halfway house?

17:16.827 --> 17:19.329
The same as the last one, Trace.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.519
Evie, this is my mom.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.394
No way. She's like the hot big sister.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.737
What do you want me to do?

17:43.854 --> 17:47.108
- Can you take us to Melrose?
- Oh, let's go.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.833
Find some really cute platforms,
or maybe some of that body glitter.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.493
No, Mom, it's okay.

17:56.617 --> 18:00.121
Just drop us off and then go
run an errand or something.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.082
Oh.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.722
Okay. I guess that'll be all right,
maybe for an hour.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.508
I have to talk to Evie's mom, though.

18:12.883 --> 18:15.227
<i>Brooke is just my guardian.</i>

18:19.223 --> 18:21.351
Great, thank you.

18:23.144 --> 18:27.115
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.
I haven't talked to Brooke yet.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.739
Mom, please don't do this to me.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.366
This is the best day of my life.
I'll kill you if you embarrass me.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.336
- Okay.
- Okay.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.508
Hi. This is Melanie. I'm Tracy's mom.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.384
Okay, I'll push it up.
What am I saying?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.887
My boobs fit in everything.
It's my ass that isn't fitting.

18:58.012 --> 19:02.392
Evie, Brooke says you're not allowed
on Melrose without adult supervision.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.730
You're here, aren't you, Mel?

19:07.855 --> 19:10.574
Yep. I am.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.866
What do you think?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.491
Mom? Do I look okay?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.747
You look incredible.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.967
You love the leopard fur, Mel?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.758
Yep.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.881
But not for 75 bucks, baby.

19:34.006 --> 19:38.762
- Why? Mom!
- Guys! This only costs 19.95.

19:49.730 --> 19:54.236
<i>This is it! This is the digs, the nest!
My Mount Olympus, baby!</i>

19:57.738 --> 20:01.743
<i>- Hey, boys.
- This is it, this is the dream place.</i>

20:02.368 --> 20:04.245
<i>- Hey, Evie.
- Check this out.</i>

20:04.495 --> 20:07.465
<i>The design is set up feng</i> shui.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.753
Dude, I want my $9 back.

20:11.877 --> 20:16.383
Only way that movie would be decent is if
Britney had her booty hanging all over.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.139
Yeah, with a car blowing up
in the background.

20:20.845 --> 20:24.975
Hey, Christ, I at least wanted
to see some tits.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.317
- Your little friend is coming.
- What?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.238
Oh, shit.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.616
- I'm Evie Zamora.
- Yeah, I know.

20:41.824 --> 20:43.246
I'm Noel.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.496
Pizza?

20:48.873 --> 20:51.843
We love Hawaiian. Don't you, Evie?

20:55.004 --> 20:56.597
Hey, hey, hey.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.475
Let's go, Trace.

21:00.217 --> 21:05.223
- You can't go to the park anyway, right?
- You can't go either after dark.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.738
You guys wanna get high?
Four bucks a hit.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.444
Let's trip. For sure.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.113
We're in.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.867
Pay me back when we get home.

21:28.204 --> 21:31.208
- What's up?
- Guys wanna buy some shit?

21:31.373 --> 21:32.750
Yeah. What you got?

21:55.981 --> 21:58.359
I see spiders.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.320
I see naked people.

22:05.199 --> 22:07.122
My God.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.459
Tracy.

22:57.251 --> 22:58.719
<i>Tracy!</i>

22:59.378 --> 23:02.507
Tracy! Come on.
Mom wants you home now.

23:03.757 --> 23:06.260
Tracy, get over here!

23:08.762 --> 23:11.766
- I found her, Mom.
- Oh, you guys got...

23:11.891 --> 23:17.239
Yeah, Trace, I got that game
that you wanted. Finally.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.237
- I'm a lion!
- Tracy!

23:22.484 --> 23:24.828
You hounded me for weeks
for this damn game.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.993
Oh, no, I haven't.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.744
I really haven't.

23:34.622 --> 23:39.002
Damn. How long is this gonna last?

23:40.753 --> 23:46.760
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Dropped acid at the park.</i>

23:47.259 --> 23:52.516
Evie, I think... I think
my nose is melting off.

23:53.515 --> 23:57.395
Mel, she's a teenager. Come on, baby.

23:58.896 --> 24:02.241
You want me to ground you?
You're not allowed out after dark!

24:02.358 --> 24:05.328
Mom, God!
Can't I have any privacy?

24:07.112 --> 24:09.365
I'm not allowed to see
your body anymore?

24:09.490 --> 24:11.333
No, you're not.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.123
<i>Boy.</i>

24:14.745 --> 24:16.622
Well, after he leaves, we'll talk.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.751
If he leaves.

24:28.509 --> 24:31.638
Whoa, slow down on that
apple cider there, sweetheart.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.849
Come here. Come here.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.736
<i>Soto:</i>

24:40.729 --> 24:43.073
...Mason says good night.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.338
Mom, what's going on? Mom!

25:06.255 --> 25:07.598
Go back to bed.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.755
Nice ass.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.096
Oh, no.

25:48.964 --> 25:52.389
- Mom!
- What? I'm making your fave.

25:52.593 --> 25:55.267
Mom. I have to go to the bathroom now.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.980
Can't you hold it a minute?

25:57.139 --> 25:59.983
That's how you get a
bladder infection, child abuser!

26:00.142 --> 26:01.644
That's dramatic.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.443
Let's just go pee outside, wussy.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.616
French toast is my favorite too, Mel.

26:14.615 --> 26:17.619
Hampton is my baby. You're my baby.

26:17.868 --> 26:21.338
Hey, Mason. Move your
G-string down south.

26:21.497 --> 26:25.252
Dude, no, that is so gross!
That's my brother.

26:28.879 --> 26:31.507
- Oh, my God!
- Maybe I'll marry into the family.

26:50.943 --> 26:55.824
You'll be designing a habitat which the
four of you will live in for two years.

27:00.369 --> 27:03.339
Find creative ways to recycle
the elements.

27:03.497 --> 27:07.127
Think water supply and power supply.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.382
Why are you late, Miss Freeland?

27:14.258 --> 27:17.011
Sorry. Can't a girl go to the bathroom?

27:19.388 --> 27:21.607
All right, settle down, class.

27:21.890 --> 27:24.643
- Hello?
- What I want... Put the phone away!

27:41.076 --> 27:45.377
Do you know the difference between
point-slope form and slope-intercept form?

27:45.581 --> 27:47.458
How about 10 dollars, guapo?

27:47.624 --> 27:51.504
Well, see, that's why I need
to be here at the library.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.758
- They have tutors.
- Hey, does her mom know?

27:55.007 --> 27:57.601
She's 18. Come on,
I know you're a nice guy.

27:57.843 --> 28:01.222
Okay, cool. Pick me up at 5:30. Bye.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.265
Get on the chair.

28:30.250 --> 28:34.881
Is this gonna hurt? Oh.
You haven't had your tongue pierced.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.093
I only put it in when I need to.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.611
Stick it out.

29:00.489 --> 29:04.335
Just don't open your mouth very wide
when you talk. She won't notice.

29:07.454 --> 29:09.252
I have to ask you something.

29:09.373 --> 29:10.966
What?

29:11.833 --> 29:13.506
Okay...

29:14.753 --> 29:19.509
You never did anything with
that crusty tattoo guy, right?

29:19.841 --> 29:21.969
Yeah, he ate my pussy.

29:22.344 --> 29:24.517
Oh, my God! Are you...?

29:24.721 --> 29:26.348
I'm kidding, idiot.

29:29.893 --> 29:32.146
Hey, ladies.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.943
Get a lot of studying done?

29:34.106 --> 29:35.699
We were researching, Mom.

29:35.857 --> 29:39.737
I'm in charge of the gray water module
for the Biosphere Two project.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.994
What module are you in charge of, Evie?

29:43.198 --> 29:46.327
I'm not in that class.
I'm taking advanced physics, Mel.

29:49.705 --> 29:53.585
Well, I'm happy for him that he's
finally paying off his debt, but...

29:53.750 --> 29:57.220
So what if he works weekends? You
had to work, and you had two babies.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.347
It's not like I need it for myself.

29:59.506 --> 30:02.385
- It's just that the kids are getting so...
- Mom. Mom.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.261
Can you guys say "hot"?

30:04.386 --> 30:06.263
That was Mason's favorite shirt.

30:11.143 --> 30:13.646
You two aren't the only
J. Lo's in the house.

30:13.854 --> 30:16.323
Check out these sexy colors!

30:16.481 --> 30:18.233
That's great, Mom.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.360
You need something to eat?
It's 4:00.

30:20.610 --> 30:24.990
Something real? I'll make some
turkey and cheese on whole wheat.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.575
Evil food.

30:26.742 --> 30:31.088
You know if you drink 10 glasses of
ice water a day, you'll burn 300 calories?

30:31.246 --> 30:32.998
Interesting.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.503
Mom! Three strikes and you're out!

30:37.711 --> 30:40.885
How many times you gonna
let him fuck you over?

30:42.632 --> 30:44.134
Hey.

30:45.886 --> 30:47.229
Where is my purse?

30:47.387 --> 30:51.108
Cyn, Cyn, go to the sink.
Oh, yes, I'll rinse your color out now.

30:51.266 --> 30:54.270
- I know that I left it right here.
- Baby, it's here.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.946
Honey, find Cynthia's purse.

30:56.104 --> 30:59.199
His clothes shouldn't be here.
You promised Mason and me.

30:59.358 --> 31:01.611
- No, I never promised that.
- Yes, you did!

31:01.818 --> 31:05.368
Cyn, come on. You're cooking.
You are cooking with gas.

31:05.739 --> 31:09.619
- Really quick. Over here. Over here.
- God, this is so fucked up.

31:11.745 --> 31:14.214
Put this over your face.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.626
- God, you're burning me!
- Shit, I'm sorry.

31:17.751 --> 31:20.095
- Fuck.
- There, how's that?

31:20.253 --> 31:22.472
Oh, baby, you are blond!

31:22.756 --> 31:25.384
That's weird, I thought I had
a bunch of 205 here.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.012
- I have to write a check.
- Pay me next time.

31:28.220 --> 31:33.397
Put a little gel on your hands and go
like this right before Larry picks you up.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.696
Hey, if this gets you laid,
you owe me double.

31:39.815 --> 31:43.865
Tracy Louise Freeland.
Conference time. Now.

31:44.820 --> 31:49.200
You do not pull a scene like that in
front of a client. Even Cynthia.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.828
- I'm on the phone.
- Well, get off the phone.

31:52.994 --> 31:54.621
It's Dad.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.753
He's with the baby.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.872
- Don't ever start smoking.
- Is everything okay, Mel?

32:35.996 --> 32:37.748
Yeah.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.251
Not.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.757
Evie, I'm sorry, but I think
it's time for you to go home.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.509
I can't go home.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.106
Brooke had a convention
in Bakersfield.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.358
She said she sent you an e-mail.

32:56.766 --> 32:58.894
I guess I didn't check my e-mail.

33:01.354 --> 33:04.824
I'm sorry, Mel.
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.736
Well...

33:11.114 --> 33:13.993
I guess it's gonna have to he, isn't it?

33:14.201 --> 33:16.750
Her boyfriend hits me, Mel.

33:25.128 --> 33:29.634
He grabbed my throat
and he threw me against his van.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.139
Oh, Jesus.

33:43.605 --> 33:45.949
Where's your mother, baby?

33:46.233 --> 33:49.737
- Where's your...?
- She passed away.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.824
I didn't have a mother
when I was your age.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.619
I know how hard it is.

33:57.953 --> 33:59.876
I do.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.764
- Mom.
- What is it, baby?

34:13.009 --> 34:15.306
Dad's on the phone.
He wants to talk to you.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.766
- They moved into the new place.
- Okay.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.147
- How's the new house?
- It's an apartment, Mom.

34:25.647 --> 34:28.400
So are you taking them
Saturday night?

34:31.777 --> 34:34.246
That sounds like a big deal.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.283
Congratulations.

34:37.617 --> 34:40.996
- Well, sure, sure.
- He's our fucking father.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.755
- Baby, I...
- He's never with us!

34:43.915 --> 34:45.632
No, not you.

34:45.917 --> 34:51.174
You know, you're going digital on me?
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.759
So we're not staying with him?

34:53.925 --> 34:57.771
He gets to go to some black-tie event.

34:58.179 --> 35:02.685
Hey. Something for NASA.

35:03.893 --> 35:06.487
Says he's gonna try
to have brunch on Sunday.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.865
You get out, you get out of here.

35:09.024 --> 35:12.028
Terrific. Now he might as well
be on the fucking moon.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.659
No, no. My mom will kill me.

35:18.867 --> 35:22.417
- She smokes.
- No shit, the same brand.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.664
No shit.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.928
If you want it so bad.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.772
Look what I got from the tattoo shop.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.392
Let's do it right now.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.688
Here. Sewing kit.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.029
This is probably gonna hurt
worse than your tongue.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.910
I don't give a shit, just do it.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.879
Oh, fuck!

36:05.038 --> 36:06.915
What the fuck did you do?

36:12.921 --> 36:17.017
- Everything okay, Evie?
- Yeah, we just spilled a Coke, Mel.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.617
Trace, it's cool
that you're not scared of needles.

36:34.109 --> 36:37.113
We can go and get tattoos.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.786
More piercings.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.917
May I come in?

36:46.037 --> 36:47.789
Sure, Mel.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.501
I've got a surprise.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.882
I sewed on the leopard fur.

37:01.803 --> 37:05.023
The fur was thicker at Red Balls.

37:06.057 --> 37:11.029
- These are tight, Mel.
- Thanks. It only cost 6 bucks.

37:11.688 --> 37:16.034
Tracy, tomorrow you gotta sit down
and do all your homework.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.282
Maybe you could go to Noel's.

37:18.486 --> 37:22.036
- She called a couple of times, you know?
- I know, Mom. I know.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.659
<i>Okay -</i>

37:24.784 --> 37:27.253
Good night, my little beauties.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.923
I love you, Mel.

37:42.177 --> 37:44.020
Mom.

37:44.929 --> 37:48.934
Don't go in my room without asking me
again. Those were my favorite jeans.

37:49.142 --> 37:52.066
I don't go into your room
and screw with your stuff.

37:52.270 --> 37:56.901
When have you ever seen me mess
with anything that was yours? Mom!

38:06.117 --> 38:07.164
Fuck her.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.292
Yo, Evie!

38:13.666 --> 38:16.670
- You ready?
- I'm going to the park with KK.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.798
Give me a sec, okay?

38:20.256 --> 38:22.258
Go away!

38:28.765 --> 38:30.062
What, do you wanna come?

38:31.017 --> 38:33.941
- Yeah.
- It's just gonna be me and KK.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.655
You know?

38:35.855 --> 38:37.528
You ready?

38:43.655 --> 38:45.749
Stop biting me!

40:33.640 --> 40:36.018
I love you, Tracy.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.788
Evie?

41:13.554 --> 41:15.807
- Stick out on the sides.
- Are they real?

41:15.932 --> 41:19.186
- Possums? Okay. When I...
- Well, excuse me.

41:19.394 --> 41:21.943
Oh, hey. Grab some oatmeal.

41:23.272 --> 41:26.276
- It's okay, I'm on a diet.
- No, you should put some...

41:26.401 --> 41:29.371
...chocolate chips in it.
It's actually very good.

41:29.529 --> 41:33.659
Come on, Tracy. You know you get
mean when you don't eat.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.914
Fuck you.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.504
Come on, Evie. Let's go.

41:39.747 --> 41:43.797
Hey, Evie, could you just
give us a little second?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.920
Yeah, sure.

41:49.882 --> 41:52.135
Does Brooke have a boyfriend?

41:52.427 --> 41:55.806
- No. She dumped him.
- When?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.641
Last week or something.

41:57.807 --> 42:01.311
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. He's in Orlando.

42:01.436 --> 42:04.406
- Now can I go to school?
- Yeah.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.743
All of a sudden Medina
has a ghetto booty?

42:08.901 --> 42:11.620
- I think she stuffs.
- That slut ain't got shit...

42:11.779 --> 42:13.907
...compared to these
double cheeseburgers.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.126
Shake it, don't break it, bitch.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.628
Fuck her.

42:19.412 --> 42:21.790
- Javi, you look hot.
- What up?

42:21.998 --> 42:24.126
Hey, Marcus. Javi.

42:24.417 --> 42:27.136
- Hey, Evie.
- Hey, what's up, Marcus?

42:29.130 --> 42:31.303
Hey, Tracy. Can I holler at you?

42:31.507 --> 42:33.180
Yeah.

42:40.266 --> 42:43.395
I was wondering if maybe you
wanna go kick it sometime.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.491
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay, well, can I have your number?

42:48.983 --> 42:52.032
- Yeah.
- Here's my cell. We'll be hanging out.

42:57.158 --> 43:01.129
- Straight. See you guys later.
'Bye.

43:07.627 --> 43:10.005
Oh, God, he's so cool.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.391
I don't want him to come over
and see Mason and the loser.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.510
Let's all go to my place.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.021
My aunt says only one friend
at a time.

43:18.179 --> 43:19.681
- Come on, babe.
- Okay.

43:19.806 --> 43:21.649
I'm sorry, Astrid.

43:22.517 --> 43:25.441
- Let me call my mom. 'Fine:

43:28.022 --> 43:31.151
- Dude, they say it's 2 feet overhead.
- Yeah? Good call.

43:31.275 --> 43:34.620
Oh, my God. Please don't tell me
that they live here.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.908
No, they're old news. She's my
cousin, not my mom. Got it?

43:38.116 --> 43:40.494
- Don't tell them I like them.
- Hey, boys!

43:40.660 --> 43:44.164
- My friend wants to suck your dick!
- Oh, my God.

43:44.372 --> 43:46.295
That was so not cool.

43:46.916 --> 43:49.795
- Here's my pad.
- Hey, babe.

43:50.169 --> 43:52.672
- Tracy, meet the lovely Brooke LaLaine.
- Hello.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.674
Hi. She's a cute one.

43:54.799 --> 43:58.053
Oh, Tracy,
your mom has been calling.

43:58.302 --> 44:01.556
- Honey, can you get me another beer?
- Yeah.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.028
Evie?

44:12.233 --> 44:14.031
It's okay.

44:15.528 --> 44:19.874
- So you're a model?
- She's a model-slash-actress.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.870
Slash-bartender who's about to be
late for work. What time is it?

44:24.036 --> 44:26.004
- It's like 4:30 or 5.
- Oh, shit.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.046
Hey, no more than one.
You got homework.

44:29.250 --> 44:32.754
They were removing asbestos
from the locker room today, so...

44:32.879 --> 44:35.928
...we got the whole gym period
to do our homework.

44:36.174 --> 44:38.017
Yeah, baby.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.680
I love you, Christina Ricci!

44:41.888 --> 44:43.265
- Tracy?
- What-y?

44:43.431 --> 44:46.184
You're going out with Javi!

44:47.310 --> 44:49.938
Evie, goddamn it,
where': My other cutlet?

44:51.981 --> 44:53.904
- Oh, shit.
- Incoming cutlet!

44:54.108 --> 44:57.908
- Nice meeting you.
- Very nice meeting you too, princess.

44:58.279 --> 44:59.997
Is that your phone?

45:00.990 --> 45:03.163
Popular! Hello?

45:03.367 --> 45:05.290
- It's Javi.
- Oh, my God!

45:05.494 --> 45:07.872
Yeah, she's here.
You wanna talk to her?

45:08.039 --> 45:11.134
Relax, breathe. Calm down.

45:12.543 --> 45:14.136
Hey.

45:16.255 --> 45:19.759
No, I'm not too busy. Can we
do something tonight if Ruben comes?

45:19.926 --> 45:21.269
Yes!

45:21.427 --> 45:23.930
Hello? Come over. Right now.
Okay, bye.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.308
You get to make out with Javi!

45:33.022 --> 45:35.400
You don't know how to kiss, do you?

45:35.524 --> 45:40.155
Oh, no. Yes, I do. Me and Noel practiced
with Cruel Intentions like 50 times.

45:40.279 --> 45:42.031
Right.

45:42.907 --> 45:47.538
- So you want me to prove it, - What?
- Hell, no.

45:56.545 --> 45:59.173
I barely even felt that.

45:59.507 --> 46:02.807
Oh, well, see if you fucking
feel this one then!

46:14.355 --> 46:16.608
Well, okay.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.369
All right, honeys, I'm out of here.

46:19.527 --> 46:23.157
Oh, and if Benny calls,
tell him I'll be down at Rene's.

46:23.364 --> 46:26.789
- Don't do anything I wouldn't do!
- Your lighter sucks.

46:27.660 --> 46:32.040
Okay, remember the part when Josh is
smoking a joint, the beer, and he's all...

46:34.041 --> 46:37.295
- I don't remember that.
- I didn't either.

46:38.170 --> 46:39.922
Did he do that same face too?

46:40.131 --> 46:44.136
You jumped on me when that teacher
got a pencil stabbed through her hand.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.513
- That wasn't even scary.
- Yeah, it was.

46:46.679 --> 46:48.807
What is this shit, man?

46:49.682 --> 46:51.434
Check this out.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.861
Is it getting kind of hot in here,
or is it me?

48:30.282 --> 48:33.286
We are so perfect for each other.

48:35.663 --> 48:40.760
You know, if everybody married
someone from a different race...

48:40.876 --> 48:45.302
...then in one generation
there would be no prejudice.

48:50.886 --> 48:54.265
- So you had a good time?
- Yeah.

48:55.808 --> 48:59.062
But it tasted kind of nasty.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.901
What? We didn't go over that one.

49:08.863 --> 49:10.865
Want anything special
from the market?

49:11.031 --> 49:14.251
No, thanks, Mel.
I like everything you get.

49:14.410 --> 49:16.788
Hey, Trace, do my back.

49:31.677 --> 49:35.557
- Who's that?
- Luke. Or "Lifeguard Boy."

49:35.681 --> 49:38.525
His parents moved away
and left him the house.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.364
(He)', Luke!

49:45.357 --> 49:46.859
Got any beer?

49:48.777 --> 49:51.906
Luke, you are so lucky!

49:53.365 --> 49:55.413
I want your house.

50:14.178 --> 50:17.148
You know, I think I'm gonna call
some of my friends.

50:17.306 --> 50:19.274
How about we make a Luke sandwich?

50:19.433 --> 50:22.152
- How about you're jail bait?
- Yeah.

50:24.396 --> 50:25.739
You know what?

50:25.898 --> 50:28.742
Luke, you know I'll never tell.
Trace, would I tell?

50:28.901 --> 50:31.620
No, because Ruben would kill you.

50:32.238 --> 50:33.865
- Come on, Luke.
- No, no.

50:34.031 --> 50:37.160
Danger. Danger, will Robinson.

50:37.868 --> 50:41.873
- Luke, it's not illegal to kiss.
- Says who?

50:50.548 --> 50:54.394
Tracy, come here.
Check out his white-boy ghetto lips.

50:54.510 --> 50:56.183
- Try it. Come on.
- NO-

50:56.303 --> 50:58.021
- Come on!
- It's Luke.

50:58.305 --> 51:01.650
- So?
- Come on, you guys.

51:08.148 --> 51:09.525
Go, girl.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.531
Luke, where's your bong?

51:12.903 --> 51:14.780
Right there.

51:21.161 --> 51:24.290
Why don't you get back over here,
though, girl. Come here.

51:50.024 --> 51:52.026
Feels good, huh, Luke?

51:52.151 --> 51:54.153
You know you want it.

52:00.367 --> 52:03.416
You know what?
You know what? This is...

52:03.621 --> 52:06.670
why don't you guys get out of my
house. Get the fuck out.

52:06.874 --> 52:09.297
- Stop. Just stop. Now get out. Please.
'shite.

52:09.501 --> 52:11.754
- Just get out.
- What is wrong with you?

52:11.920 --> 52:14.423
- Now, please.
- Get off me, you fucking pervert!

52:14.548 --> 52:17.267
Please, just get out of my house.
Just go.

52:17.426 --> 52:21.181
- Luke, chill out. We're leaving already.
- Get out of here.

52:28.437 --> 52:32.362
- Hey, could you guys give me a hand?
- Mom, I'm not your fucking slave!

52:39.156 --> 52:40.533
Shit.

52:40.658 --> 52:42.410
Shit, my breath!

52:44.745 --> 52:47.373
- Toothpaste, toothpaste.
- Where's the mouthwash?

52:51.251 --> 52:53.174
Hey.

52:53.295 --> 52:55.548
Hey, open this door now!

52:55.798 --> 52:59.052
- What do you want, Mother?
- This is not how I raised you.

52:59.176 --> 53:03.056
- I want you to be civil to me.
- I want you and your stupid boyfriend...

53:03.180 --> 53:05.683
...to get out of my life!
What's he doing here?

53:05.891 --> 53:09.566
- Have you been drinking?
- Of course. She's always fucking drinking!

53:09.687 --> 53:11.610
- Right, Tracy?
- Like you never have!

53:11.772 --> 53:14.366
- Hey, hey, come on.
- You guys!

53:15.359 --> 53:18.033
- Hey, Kayla.
- Birdie, what's going on?

53:18.153 --> 53:19.655
- Hey, - It's okay.

53:19.863 --> 53:24.289
I thought we'd crash here for a couple
of days, just until my check comes in.

53:25.244 --> 53:28.544
- Let me take that from you.
- I'm coming down with diphtheria.

53:28.747 --> 53:31.125
Yeah, sure, just for a couple of days.

53:31.291 --> 53:35.012
- Mason, can you find your sleeping bag?
- Yeah.

53:35.170 --> 53:39.175
Why not open a hotel, Mom? You know,
you should get paid for all this.

53:39.299 --> 53:43.145
Tracy, baby, this is just temporary.

53:55.149 --> 54:00.155
- Where did all this stuff come from?
- Brooke bought it for me. Us.

54:03.282 --> 54:04.909
Come on, Evie!

54:05.117 --> 54:06.790
"Wanna bone?"

54:06.910 --> 54:08.628
Nice.

54:11.790 --> 54:13.918
What's the occasion?

54:14.126 --> 54:18.927
She wanted to say thank you
for taking care of me.

54:30.684 --> 54:33.904
- Baby, we have to have a real talk.
- Wanna go to the park?

54:34.062 --> 54:37.157
- Mom, I have more homework to do.
- Yeah.

54:37.357 --> 54:39.906
You should go to more meetings.

54:41.153 --> 54:47.536
No, you don't understand. It's different
this time. She's starting to scare me.

54:58.670 --> 55:02.766
I know. I know. I know.
Damn it. I know.

55:04.301 --> 55:07.145
I just wanna make it stop.

55:09.056 --> 55:11.184
You fucking hard-ass.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.936
That's why you're my sponsor.

55:16.355 --> 55:19.905
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try.

55:20.025 --> 55:23.120
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

55:23.862 --> 55:26.115
- Yeah, baby. Close your eyes.
- Oh, my God.

55:26.281 --> 55:30.752
Close them. Close them. Oh, loving it.
Loving it. You are a gold queen.

55:30.911 --> 55:32.663
Hey: Guys'

55:32.871 --> 55:34.544
What the hell?

55:34.665 --> 55:36.542
Watch his head.

55:37.251 --> 55:40.425
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God!

55:41.171 --> 55:44.175
Yeah. Zen chicken.

55:44.383 --> 55:46.260
That's weird, right?

55:47.636 --> 55:49.309
It doesn't even move.

55:49.429 --> 55:51.557
Chickens are cool, aren't they?

55:51.807 --> 55:53.434
Cool.

56:05.779 --> 56:08.123
- Oh, Mom, no, I can't see that movie.
- Why?

56:08.282 --> 56:12.128
Because it's a gross, bloody war movie,
and I'm a pacifist like Gandhi.

56:12.286 --> 56:16.666
- Why don't we see the Jack Black movie?
- The Misadventures of Ezekial <i>Balls.</i>

56:16.790 --> 56:18.667
It looks funny. It's a giant pig!

56:18.792 --> 56:21.671
- I won't be seeing that.
- Come on. It's family night.

56:21.795 --> 56:24.765
We'll see separate movies.
We'll meet here at 10:15.

56:24.923 --> 56:28.518
Two for the pig movie and two
for the handsome fellow in the war.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.806
- You are so awesome.
- Look, I've got popcorn...

56:32.014 --> 56:35.439
...and butter
in a separate foil packet...

56:35.559 --> 56:39.484
- ...for the little ones.
- Thanks, Mom.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.648
- Okay.
- Thanks, Mel! I love you guys!

56:41.857 --> 56:43.154
Love you.

56:43.358 --> 56:45.656
I thought that was our popcorn.

56:58.540 --> 57:00.292
Bye, Mom!

57:01.251 --> 57:02.628
Later, Jack.

57:11.136 --> 57:13.309
Come on, Mrs. Hooch.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.558
Mothers, lock up your sons!

57:47.673 --> 57:49.550
What's up, ladies?

57:50.509 --> 57:53.058
How you guys doing tonight?
You guys having fun?

57:54.805 --> 57:57.524
- I got my ass beat for the other night.
- Oh, yeah?

57:57.683 --> 57:59.560
Hey, Javi, come spit that verse!

57:59.685 --> 58:01.437
Oh, all right.

58:09.361 --> 58:11.534
Why don't you go get us some sodas?

58:11.655 --> 58:15.034
And you know what? Tell Conrad
to get down here on his break!

58:15.158 --> 58:16.375
<i>Okay -</i>

58:22.374 --> 58:25.048
Yeah, I just got mine pierced
the other day.

58:25.293 --> 58:27.512
You stupid fucker!

58:27.796 --> 58:30.549
Oh, sweetie. Back that ass up.

58:30.757 --> 58:33.306
I'd like to see how that thong
looks on my bedroom floor.

58:33.427 --> 58:36.306
- Too bad you'll never know.
- Tracy?

58:40.308 --> 58:43.187
Oh, shit. God. Fuck it.

58:43.562 --> 58:47.032
- Hey, Tracy. Here's your Cokes.
- I didn't pay for them anyway.

58:47.232 --> 58:50.406
- You didn't have to with your fine ass.
- Fuck you.

59:00.162 --> 59:03.917
- You seen Evie?
- No. She went to the candy store.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.668
Want some?

59:07.627 --> 59:09.755
- Easy!
- What the fuck is that?

59:09.921 --> 59:12.765
It's my voodoo juice my friends made.

59:14.301 --> 59:16.520
Hey, don't be back washing.

59:20.182 --> 59:21.934
Wanna go find her?

59:22.142 --> 59:23.940
Yeah.

59:26.021 --> 59:27.898
You all right?

59:29.775 --> 59:32.995
Tracy? Let's go. Come on.

59:42.162 --> 59:43.505
Evie?

59:49.503 --> 59:51.176
Evie?

59:54.508 --> 59:56.431
Evie?

59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.431
You all right?

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:05.190
- Wanna suck my cock, baby?
- No!

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:08.897
Evie!

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.530
Evie!

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:17.031
Hey! Hi!

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.034
Javi spilled Coke on his pants
and couldn't perform...

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:24.538
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Do you even know what time it is? Shit!

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.132
Hey.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:30.294
Call me, baby.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:35.803
Jeez, Mom, I can't help it
if the movie ran early.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:39.932
- Bullshit, Tracy. We checked the theater.
- We got a drink at Starbucks.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.182
- What's wrong with that?
- Where's the backpack?

01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:45.813
I got you a keychain.

01:00:54.526 --> 01:00:56.779
Hey. How was the movie?

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.409
Good.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.366
Mom, I gotta talk to you. In private.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.412
Okay. Come in the kitchen.
I'm making tea.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.041
I'll help you.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:09.921
Should we talk about how you
get stoned every night with Rafa?

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.009
She knows I smoke pot, Tracy.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.515
Look at your pupils.
You're so fucking busted.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.050
I'm gonna fucking...

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:21.262
- Jesus Christ! Goddamn it!
- Don't ever touch me again!

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:24.932
Go ahead! Hit me! Come on!
You'll go to jail, you fucking slut!

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.566
Don't you fucking call me a slut!
Mom! Mason just called me a slut!

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.280
- Melanie!
- Hey, stop, stop, stop! Stop it!

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.528
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Wait, wait! Stop it!

01:01:34.733 --> 01:01:37.737
- Tracy, look at this shit!
- You know she didn't mean it.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:40.281
Mom, don't touch me!
Don't touch my hair!

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.287
- She's out of control.
- Have you eaten anything today?

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.415
- Mom, stop with the food thing already!
- Fuck it.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.544
You don't want me to cook
for you anymore? Fine.

01:01:49.748 --> 01:01:53.252
- Then don't eat my food.
- Fine! I hate your nasty food anyway!

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:54.798
Great!

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:59.679
Then I can stop doing 12 haircuts
a day trying to pay for all this shit!

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.268
You think I wanna be here?

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.940
Fuck!

01:02:13.104 --> 01:02:14.777
Damn it.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:31.006
Goddamn dollar-fifty-a-square-foot floor!

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:37.424
Mel. Mel!

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.689
I told you we need a new floor.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.403
Baby?

01:02:54.854 --> 01:02:57.653
Mel? You all right?

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.529
Yeah, okay. I'm okay.

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:04.497
- You're okay.
- I'm okay. I need to call Sue.

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.533
Mom!

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:12.130
Don't worry about that, all right?
I'll take care of it.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.507
Mom!

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:21.052
- Yeah, what is it?
- I can't even sleep in my own bed?

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:24.055
We can all sleep in here
if we just get this dog out.

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:25.681
- Yeah. Wake up, girl. 'Out:

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.429
Come on.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.560
Oh, Jesus.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.439
Something peed in your bed.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.691
We'll change the sheets.
Take her.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:39.240
- Mom, you're dealing with this!
- I'll take care of it.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:43.154
You know what, Tracy?
You're gonna have to lay off of her.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.623
Don't tell me what to do,
you fucking cokehead.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.876
You're such a loser.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:12.391
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.435
Arms up.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.406
I can't do this with her anymore.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:32.161
I can't. I can't.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.542
I'm horrible.

01:04:43.421 --> 01:04:45.674
Get in the shower, Mel.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:26.298
This place is fucking with my head.

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:31.303
And, well, I wanna get loaded.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.391
Go see Mario.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.738
He'll read the Big Book
in that scratchy voice.

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.654
Okay, I know what to do.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.504
Evie, I have to ask you something.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.290
What?

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:04.799
What happened in the dressing room
with you and Javi?

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:08.553
Nothing, cokehead. He's your guy.

01:06:22.187 --> 01:06:25.487
- Here.
- So, what's with the spoons?

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.403
- Just go like this.
- It's really cold.

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.781
- You're gonna call Evie's mom.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:36.035
And then I'm just gonna talk to her
for a few minutes.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.290
- She's just a kid, after all.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:43.417
Mason, could you come in here
for a second, please?

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.551
Brooke does this every morning
and still has huge bags.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:52.259
I wonder how much of this you have
to swallow for it to kill you.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.554
This family needs some healing.

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:58.560
- Who bought you that wet suit?
- Fuck you.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:00.934
Your mother's phone
has been disconnected.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:05.238
She's not my mom, she's my cousin.
My mom was a crack whore.

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:09.743
Okay, everybody just take a deep breath.

01:07:09.901 --> 01:07:14.281
Evie, honey, do you have a friend that
you could stay with for a few days?

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:17.038
I think this family
needs some alone time.

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:21.538
Cynthia, I'm the one that's here every
day trying to make the situation better.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:23.631
Ask Mel.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:28.045
Look, Mom, there's a huge swell,
and I gotta get pounded.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:30.513
It's okay, baby. Just go.

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:34.680
- Phone!
- Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:38.809
- Hello? It's Conrad.
- Hey, Spidey.

01:07:39.013 --> 01:07:41.562
Evie, let's talk about you
for a minute, okay?

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:44.645
- I need to make sure...
- Are you a licensed therapist?

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.813
Bring the stuff
and I'll give you a surprise.

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.859
- She's done great things for me.
- She's a psychic.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:52.652
Remember when
you tried to bring back Grandma...

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:54.996
...and Hampton ended up
humping your leg?

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:57.498
- Cynthia, I can handle this.
- Bye-bye.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:08:00.285
I should... I should be
getting back to work.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:04.373
- I could be selling houses right now.
- 10:30 at Nona's.

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:08.294
Cynthia can handle it, Mom.
You want me to model my new thong?

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.888
- Perfect for pooping on the go.
- What's that on your shirt?

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.678
None of your business.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.766
- What is it?
- Don't worry about it.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:18.519
- Let me see.
- What is it with you and poking me?

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.894
- I just wanna see what you've got there.
- Mom, stop!

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.107
What the hell is that?

01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:33.859
- I'm talking to you.
- It's a bellybutton ring.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:38.206
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- It's a bellybutton ring.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:42.118
How else can I say it?
I don't speak no other languages.

01:08:42.327 --> 01:08:44.750
Oh, and you wanna know what that is?

01:08:45.496 --> 01:08:47.999
That is a tongue ring.

01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:54.631
- When did you do all this, baby?
- Oh, Mom, 2000 years ago.

01:08:54.756 --> 01:08:58.010
I'm a mummy.
I was born 2000 years ago.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:02.848
Tracy, Tracy, Tracy. I'm really starting
to lose it. Stop it, please.

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:09.647
No bra, no panties.
No bra, no panties.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.819
- Stop it.
- No bra, no panties.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.251
- You have to take her for a while.
- Mel, I can't.

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:30.341
- I need you to.
- I've been on the phone all morning...

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.845
- ...trying to get out of this thing.
- I need you to take her.

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.471
Are you hearing me here? I can't.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:40.389
I will talk to her.
It'll be just fine. All right?

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.470
Where is she?

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:45.264
Is she in the back?

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.740
Hey, how you doing?

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:58.077
Listen, we gotta talk about something.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:01.995
I gotta tell you upfront
that I can't take you this weekend.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.119
I knew that you wouldn't take me.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:10.248
Tracy. Look, baby.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:14.128
You... You have gotta
cut me some slack, okay?

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.505
I am trying to kick ass at this new job.

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:20.850
I am trying to get you
and your mom more money. That's all...

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:24.137
Let me shut this thing off.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.567
What's the problem?

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.108
What's going on?

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:39.326
Can I help?

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:42.948
Tracy, you gotta talk to me.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:49.121
Dad, do you even remember
what the last thing we did together was?

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:53.842
- Dad, just answer the fucking thing.
- Look, this could be an emergency. I...

01:10:54.083 --> 01:11:00.136
Let me take this. Yeah? No, I can't.
I'm with a client right now.

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:04.970
Look, Chris, I will call you
from the airport, okay? Fine.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:08.390
Nice talking to you, Dad.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.520
Baby, I'm not going anywhere, okay?
You know, fuck this work shit, okay?

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:16.982
I'm calling him right now
and telling him I'm not going...

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.859
Dad, just go, okay?

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:23.617
Really, you need this job.

01:11:25.239 --> 01:11:27.367
Yeah, baby, I do need this job.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:37.094
- Nice car.
- Yeah, it's just a silly business tool.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:41.882
We're going surfing in two weeks, right?
San 0's? Okay.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.634
She needs help, Dad.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:48.142
Okay. Okay.

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:50.731
What is the problem?

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:55.270
Can somebody please just tell me,
what is the problem?

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.989
In a nutshell.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:02.110
Wha...?

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.366
Mason, wait a..

01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:14.247
Hey.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.004
Nice car.

01:13:05.256 --> 01:13:08.009
- Morning, Mom.
- Whoa. Hey. Hi.

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:10.011
Knocking's real good.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.768
Mom, we have something
really important...

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:16.647
- ...that we need to talk about, okay?
- Okay.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:25.618
I think that I would get along
a lot better with everybody...

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:28.864
...if Evie just lived with us.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:31.490
Brooke will pay you to take me.

01:13:31.699 --> 01:13:34.122
She won't be like
all the other freeloaders.

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:37.001
She was abused...

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:40.716
...by her uncle when she was 9.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:44.963
Mel, he put things inside me.

01:13:45.338 --> 01:13:48.342
And he pushed me into a fire.

01:13:50.468 --> 01:13:55.144
'Mamas:
- You could really help me if I lived here.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:58.142
You could maybe even save me.

01:13:58.392 --> 01:14:00.520
Okay, I'll think about it.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.443
You're so cool.

01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:04.858
Bye,

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:11.115
why did you put me on the spot
in front of that poor little girl?

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:14.117
I can't reject someone
like that to her face.

01:14:14.325 --> 01:14:15.952
I know, Mom.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:20.624
- Come on, Tracy.
- Goodbye. I love you.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.389
I got a C-plus. Moving up.
What'd you get?

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:38.975
Let's just say my mom isn't gonna
get a bumper sticker this year.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:45.069
Oh, I wanna bleed more. Hit me!

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:49.236
Make an effort, bitch.

01:14:57.868 --> 01:14:59.745
Tracy?

01:15:02.873 --> 01:15:04.716
Tracy?

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.094
- Food's ready, ladies.
- Just a minute.

01:15:07.253 --> 01:15:09.221
Tracy?

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:12.637
Get up, okay?

01:15:17.388 --> 01:15:22.144
- We can't go out like this.
- Oh, shit.

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.238
Here.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.977
- Her uncle got seven years.
- Look at you.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:01.520
You're stretched to the limit.
Shit, you're stretched beyond the limit.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.143
Kayla and I are sleeping in a tent?

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.771
She's been abused
by practically everyone...

01:16:06.937 --> 01:16:10.237
...who was supposed to take
care of her. I have to help her.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:14.488
No, Mom, come on,
you don't know that. I mean, Jesus.

01:16:15.488 --> 01:16:17.616
How do we look, darling?

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:24.877
Guys, say hello to the butt.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:29.131
- I wanna play. I wanna play.
- Okay.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:35.258
- What happened to your lip?
- Nothing, Mom. I just bit it.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:38.511
Is that my belt, Evie?

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:41.222
Yeah.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.484
Do you have any film?
You want to take pictures of us?

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:55.194
No, Evie, I don't.

01:16:55.361 --> 01:17:01.209
Okay, kids, this is the day. You guys
did a great job, these all look really...

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.871
What?

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:11.507
Oh, my God.
Wait. Today's the due date?

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.005
You guys could've called to remind me.

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:18.343
- We left you a bunch of messages.
- Not to mention a note on your locker.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:24.145
Our phone's been disconnected
because we're having family problems.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:27.227
My grandmother, she passed away.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:32.733
Go to the counselor, Tracy.
She'll talk to your mom. Now.

01:17:36.443 --> 01:17:37.820
Knock it off, you guys.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:42.950
Fuck.

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:55.847
So you just wanna go
to the boardwalk and sell some shit?

01:17:56.255 --> 01:18:02.513
I can't. I'm late for marine biology,
actually. We're doing a play.

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:04.730
And I'm a mermaid.

01:18:39.381 --> 01:18:42.760
I can't even remember
how to spell "photographer."

01:18:50.643 --> 01:18:52.862
Where are we going, Mel?

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:12.339
Brooke. Wow.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:17.345
- I've been calling for two weeks.
- Sweetie, sorry.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:23.351
Sorry, sorry. I just...
I didn't want you to see me like this.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.637
They cut off my ears.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:28.472
What?

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:31.518
They cut off my ears.

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:37.945
Okay, girls, please go out to the car.
Okay? Please. Please go out to the car.

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:44.330
I had that little kind of
turkey-neck thing, you know?

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:47.958
I mean, listen, I had a kid to support.
I mean, fuck.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:51.371
You had... You had plastic surgery.

01:19:51.578 --> 01:19:55.583
- Why, Brooke? You were so pretty.
- Evie knows what I'm talking about.

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:59.879
You know that little kind of flap thing
that was in the pictures?

01:20:00.087 --> 01:20:03.887
Oh, my ears hurt so bad. Look.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:08.221
- Was this, like, a standard procedure?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:13.268
I mean, you know, they had to tuck
the skin somewhere, I guess. It's just...

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:18.319
I didn't realize they'd have to do the
whole, you know, fucking crop circle.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.198
Right.

01:20:21.191 --> 01:20:23.614
So everything's okay, then?

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.867
Yeah.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.117
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

01:20:30.242 --> 01:20:32.244
Excuse me.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:35.748
Oh, God, I'm a mess.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.255
Beer.

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:42.881
- Can I get you a beer?
- No, that's okay.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.007
We're gonna split.

01:20:47.468 --> 01:20:50.392
So, Evie...

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.976
...we'll bring your suitcase over
later, okay?

01:20:55.142 --> 01:20:58.237
So you're not gonna adopt me, Mel?

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:00.739
Evie, I mean...

01:21:02.232 --> 01:21:05.361
...Brooke's back, so...

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:13.892
Hi.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.766
Hey, Trace.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:26.860
- Hey, girlies. Astrid, Medina.
- Hey, baby!

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:32.699
- Ladies.
- Let's go, ladies!

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.993
Go, Brian.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:48.381
<i>Evie. Evie, that was hilarious, okay?
Now come pick me up.</i>

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.591
It's Tracy.

01:22:51.091 --> 01:22:52.889
Evie, can you hear me?

01:23:02.102 --> 01:23:04.480
- Mason, would you hurry up?
- Just a minute.

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:06.861
What the hell? Are you jacking off?

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:10.069
Hey, Tracy, I'm with a client.
Work mode.

01:23:10.235 --> 01:23:13.865
Mom, I told you
that I was having a bad day.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:18.870
- I can't wait till you move to Dad's.
- What the hell did you say?

01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:24.250
Nothing. It's just something I heard
Mom and Dad talking about, okay?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.843
Forget it.

01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:19.980
Hang on a minute.

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:24.359
- Hey, Tracy.
- Okay, hang on.

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:44.122
- You's nasty. I heard that you got used.
- What? By who?

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.590
By Conrad on the stairs at Nona's party.

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:49.877
That never happened.
Believe whatever the fuck you want.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:52.630
That's not what Evie said.
You fucking lying?

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:54.631
Bitch, you better not touch me.

01:24:54.756 --> 01:24:56.884
- Stop!
- This shit ain't over.

01:24:57.009 --> 01:25:00.138
Stop it! Hey, come back here.

01:25:01.263 --> 01:25:04.016
You've made F's
on your last three tests.

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:08.362
You haven't turned in any homework.
On that basis alone, you're gonna fail.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.690
You'll be held back in 7th grade.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:13.700
What?

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:19.615
- They can hold me back?
- Yes, they can hold you back.

01:25:19.865 --> 01:25:23.335
Tracy, your name was brought up
in Impact Group today.

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:25.370
Evie Zamora turned in your fake ID.

01:25:25.579 --> 01:25:28.253
And there's the matter of cheating
in math class.

01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:31.006
You were one of my
best students. Your poem...

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:34.505
...was one of the most
incredible I've ever read.

01:25:35.255 --> 01:25:37.257
I'm sorry.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.774
Hey, Tracy.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:52.572
Your mom sent me to pick you up.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:56.076
What's going on? I'm supposed
to be studying at Yumi's house.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:58.362
I don't think so.

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:00.830
Come on, hop in.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:45.621
It'll be okay.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:15.948
Hey, Evie.
Brooke, you healed up great.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:19.576
Sit down.

01:27:21.486 --> 01:27:24.114
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Leave your purse.

01:27:25.991 --> 01:27:27.834
Fine.

01:27:36.626 --> 01:27:38.594
Tracy.

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:40.506
What the hell?

01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:44.351
They found my stash,
and I had to tell them.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:48.264
I love you, okay?

01:27:48.472 --> 01:27:53.148
You're my girl,
remember that. I love you.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:56.942
Come on, let's go.

01:28:24.758 --> 01:28:27.887
- Tracy...
- What?

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:32.019
None of that shit': Mine.

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.144
We found it.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:39.482
What? Speak up, Mama,
because I can't hear you!

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:42.359
Do not talk to your mother like that.

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:45.613
She said, we found it
stashed around your bedroom...

01:28:45.821 --> 01:28:49.121
...all your little hiding spots.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.248
Jesus, Evie.

01:28:52.369 --> 01:28:56.840
- I had to. You don't get it.
- Oh, no, I get it.

01:28:57.207 --> 01:28:59.505
Who do you think you are
going in my room?

01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:02.132
You're lucky I got there
before the cops did.

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:06.009
Hey, I'm just trying
to help you, sweetie.

01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:12.519
How do you explain
$860 in your purse?

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:17.270
What do you expect me to say, Mom?
We jacked it, okay?

01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:21.740
It's not like your broke ass
ever has any money to give me.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:26.362
Mom, when Brady
went to the halfway house...

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:30.575
...what happened to our phone?
Our cable?

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:33.748
You didn't even know
how to pay the bills.

01:29:34.369 --> 01:29:38.499
No wonder Dad didn't want to be with
you. You didn't even finish high school!

01:29:38.748 --> 01:29:43.003
We don't have extra stuff, but we're
okay. You know we're doing okay.

01:29:43.253 --> 01:29:44.505
You don't have to steal.

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:48.258
Mom, you knew what was going on
with all those clothes and shit.

01:29:48.383 --> 01:29:52.854
- Christ, you're not that dumb, are you?
- I didn't know it went that far!

01:30:01.730 --> 01:30:03.573
Oh, God.

01:30:11.823 --> 01:30:16.329
We'll be moving up to Ojai,
so you won't be seeing Evie again.

01:30:16.494 --> 01:30:20.340
Never. You're really cruel, Tracy.

01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:25.254
I'm sure you can be a sweet kid
when you want to, but right now...

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:29.849
...you're a really bad influence.
I mean, you cheat, you lie, you steal.

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:34.013
Are you kidding? Where do you think
I learned all this shit from?

01:30:34.262 --> 01:30:36.890
Tracy was playing Barbies
before she met Evie!

01:30:37.015 --> 01:30:39.768
Did she teach you how
to beat the crap out of her?

01:30:39.976 --> 01:30:41.774
I've seen the bruises.

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:46.233
- What the hell did you tell her, Evie?
- Come here. What about this?

01:30:46.483 --> 01:30:48.861
- We were just goofing!
- Tracy didn't hit her.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:52.114
- Yes, she did!
- I don't believe this! She hit me too!

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:54.833
- And look at this, Mel.
- Don't you dare. No...

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.709
- Take your hands off her.
- No!

01:30:56.868 --> 01:31:00.338
- She cuts!
- Oh, God!

01:31:01.498 --> 01:31:04.377
It's none of your business,
you fucking Frankenstein!

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:08.255
Oh, no, this child is my business,
you little cunt.

01:31:08.505 --> 01:31:11.884
That's enough. You need to get out.

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:13.885
- Come on, Evie. Come on.
- Get out!

01:31:14.094 --> 01:31:19.601
Who would want to be in this shithole
anyway? It fucking stinks in here, Mel!

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:26.107
Oh, no, Mom. Get off of me.
I hate you. Stop.

01:31:27.565 --> 01:31:31.320
I love you and your brother
more than anything in the world.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:34.615
I'll die for you, but I won't leave
you alone right now.

01:31:34.990 --> 01:31:39.211
Mason said you wanted me to move in
with Dad. You don't want me.

01:31:39.369 --> 01:31:41.997
You don't want me.

01:31:43.248 --> 01:31:46.252
I want your dad to be in your life more.

01:31:50.255 --> 01:31:52.883
I want you here with me.

01:31:54.509 --> 01:31:56.637
You're my heart.

01:31:59.139 --> 01:32:01.483
We'll make it right.

01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:06.942
It can never be right.

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:13.327
- Get off me.
- No.

01:32:13.486 --> 01:32:20.085
Get off. Mom, please.
Don't hold me. Don't! Stop.

01:32:21.953 --> 01:32:26.629
Mom, don't. Don't.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:33.007
No, no. Oh, God.

01:32:48.229 --> 01:32:51.608
Stop. Stop.

01:32:52.108 --> 01:32:53.985
Stop.

01:33:05.622 --> 01:33:07.624
Don't.

01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:12.004
Oh, God.
