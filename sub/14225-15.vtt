00:04.629 --> 00:05.629
Any bites?

00:06.632 --> 00:07.956
Only from mosquitos.

00:09.335 --> 00:11.134
Hello, ladies.

00:11.170 --> 00:14.588
Ravi, why are you wearing a
life jacket under your shirt?

00:14.623 --> 00:16.383
I wish to know the joy
of appearing buff.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.110
Oh, look! It's a bottle
with a note in it!

00:21.146 --> 00:22.829
I hope it's a treasure map!

00:22.864 --> 00:24.138
I hope it's a signed poster
of Chris Pratt.

00:24.174 --> 00:26.541
I hope it is recyclable.

00:26.576 --> 00:27.934
What? 10 cents is 10 cents.

00:32.742 --> 00:35.124
"Being held against my will!
Please send help!"

00:35.160 --> 00:37.200
We've got to do something!

00:38.247 --> 00:40.097
Zuri, we just found a note

00:40.132 --> 00:41.692
from somebody who's
being held prisoner!

00:41.717 --> 00:44.893
Yeah, that was me.

00:44.928 --> 00:46.886
I threw it in the lake
the first day of camp

00:46.922 --> 00:49.442
after I found a beaver
tooth in my meatloaf.

00:51.644 --> 00:53.685
<i>¶ Here we go</i>

00:53.721 --> 00:56.613
<i>¶ We're leaving the city
behind right now</i>

00:56.648 --> 00:58.540
<i>¶ Let's gather by
the campfire light</i>

00:58.575 --> 01:00.400
<i>¶ And sing this song</i>

01:00.435 --> 01:02.094
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

01:03.772 --> 01:05.889
<i>¶ Hanging out with someone new</i>

01:05.924 --> 01:08.742
<i>¶ Then falling out
of a camp canoe</i>

01:08.778 --> 01:10.702
<i>¶ What's that smell?
It's on your shoe</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:11.937
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

01:13.866 --> 01:15.915
<i>¶ Got a s'more in my hair</i>

01:15.951 --> 01:18.401
<i>¶ Mosquitos in our underwear</i>

01:18.436 --> 01:20.420
<i>¶ Shower's broke
but we don't care</i>

01:20.455 --> 01:22.072
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka</i>

01:22.107 --> 01:27.244
<i>¶ This is our home away from home
away from home away from home</i>

01:27.279 --> 01:31.548
<i>¶ But watch your back
A bear just ate my phone</i>

01:31.583 --> 01:33.884
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

01:33.919 --> 01:36.294
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka</i>

01:36.330 --> 01:39.047
ALL: <i>¶ Kikiwaka, Kikiwaka ¶</i>

01:48.842 --> 01:51.259
Look, I know we were
supposed to go out tonight,

01:51.295 --> 01:53.028
but taking the kids camping
is kind of like a date.

01:53.063 --> 01:54.930
Yeah. Except instead of perfume,

01:54.965 --> 01:57.732
I'll be wearing
"skeeter killer."

01:57.767 --> 02:00.007
Well, it may repel mosquitos,
but it won't repel me.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.930
(COUGHING)

02:03.966 --> 02:05.073
Actually, it will.

02:07.652 --> 02:09.469
Maybe we can go
on a date tomorrow night?

02:09.505 --> 02:11.271
I can't. I gotta
teach a guitar class.

02:11.307 --> 02:12.689
How about Friday?

02:12.724 --> 02:14.649
I'd love to, but I'm busy.

02:14.684 --> 02:16.109
I have an archery
safety seminar.

02:16.144 --> 02:17.510
It's called "Arrows,
the pointy end"

02:17.545 --> 02:18.785
"goes away from you."

02:20.674 --> 02:22.590
Man, ever since
we started dating again,

02:22.626 --> 02:24.084
we haven't had much alone time.

02:24.119 --> 02:26.086
Hello, fellow adventurers!

02:26.121 --> 02:29.097
And the streak continues.

02:29.132 --> 02:30.983
You guys excited for your
first overnight campout?

02:31.018 --> 02:33.101
Heck yeah, I can't wait
to go exploring!

02:35.247 --> 02:39.308
It's weird, he has a costume
for every possible occasion,

02:39.343 --> 02:42.486
yet only one pair of underwear.

02:42.521 --> 02:46.564
I'm hoping to document a rare and
deadly beetle for my nature journal.

02:46.599 --> 02:50.585
If I can catch it, maybe I can use
its poison to cure a disease.

02:50.621 --> 02:54.680
Or start a global pandemic that
wipes out most of society.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.836
Either way, I'll be famous.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.728
Look, I don't wanna
spend all night

03:00.764 --> 03:02.572
camping in the scary forest.

03:02.607 --> 03:05.700
If the deadly beetles or
wild animals don't kill us,

03:05.735 --> 03:07.135
Jorge's hot dog farts will.

03:14.094 --> 03:17.011
It is a shame we cannot go on that
overnight campout with our cabins.

03:17.047 --> 03:19.739
I was really looking
forward to roughing it.

03:19.775 --> 03:23.752
Aren't you the same kid who has
four-ply toilet paper shipped in?

03:23.787 --> 03:26.147
Hey, even rugged outdoorsmen
can have sensitive heinies.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.393
Well, somebody's gotta
build this jungle gym.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.536
Gladys has a photographer
coming early tomorrow morning

03:33.571 --> 03:35.422
to take pictures
for the new camp brochure.

03:35.457 --> 03:37.507
Oh, on a related note,

03:37.542 --> 03:39.617
the kids in Bunny cabin
saw these boxes,

03:39.653 --> 03:41.661
and I promised them they
could play on it tomorrow.

03:41.696 --> 03:43.996
(SHUDDERS) Bunny cabin.

03:44.032 --> 03:46.157
They may be young,
but their bite is fierce.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.702
Tell me about it.

03:48.737 --> 03:51.396
I still have a baby tooth
lodged in my forearm

03:51.431 --> 03:53.591
from last week's
teeter-totter tumult.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.502
Well, time's a-wastin',
so let's build this...

03:57.538 --> 03:59.271
Klatterstallning?

04:01.675 --> 04:04.550
Yes, apparently,
Gladys saved money

04:04.586 --> 04:08.146
by ordering this from a Swedish
discount store called, Argh!

04:09.766 --> 04:11.349
That explains why the logo

04:11.384 --> 04:13.264
is an angry blonde guy
ripping his hair out.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.114
I assume the first step is to
consult the instruction manual.

04:18.149 --> 04:23.845
Nope. The first step is to start
whacking stuff with a hammer.

04:23.881 --> 04:26.481
Correction. The first step is to
rescue you from the instructions.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.108
Argh!

04:29.144 --> 04:31.384
Oh, that's where
the name comes from.

04:36.752 --> 04:39.436
Hey, Jorge,
you see those tracks?

04:39.471 --> 04:41.771
You can tell they're from a white-tailed
deer by the shape of the hoof.

04:41.806 --> 04:45.951
And I can tell what it had for
lunch, by what's on my hoof.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.069
Wanna see? ALL: No, thank you!

04:49.623 --> 04:50.623
Your loss.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.042
Well, this is
their feeding grounds.

04:54.077 --> 04:55.801
Deer love to eat honeysuckle.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.104
And bears love to eat deer,

04:58.139 --> 05:00.059
so let's not hang out
at the buffet.

05:02.827 --> 05:05.587
Here. A pretty flower
for a pretty girl.

05:05.622 --> 05:07.848
Thanks, Xander!

05:07.924 --> 05:10.258
What a perfect example
of nature's fragile beauty.

05:16.741 --> 05:18.541
Good thing you didn't
try to give me a puppy.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.874
Not to second guess you again,

05:25.909 --> 05:29.310
but according to the diagram,
that board is called Ulla.

05:29.346 --> 05:31.506
She needs to go with Oli,
who you have put with Gilda.

05:34.468 --> 05:37.544
No, I put two of the exact
same four by-fours together.

05:37.621 --> 05:39.661
I'm making a triangle,
not starting a bikini team.

05:42.350 --> 05:44.000
But you keep putting things
together all willy-nilly!

05:44.035 --> 05:46.878
Except for when you actually
refused to nail Willy to Nilly!

05:49.199 --> 05:51.266
Okay, this isn't working.

05:51.301 --> 05:52.809
So how about you
and your instructions,

05:52.844 --> 05:54.953
go build the slide structure.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.430
Me and my instincts
will handle the swing set,

05:57.466 --> 06:00.132
and we'll see
who finishes first.

06:00.168 --> 06:02.777
Very well. May the best
klatterstaller win!

06:02.812 --> 06:04.020
Ladies, come with me!

06:06.808 --> 06:08.299
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

06:08.334 --> 06:10.235
Not you, I was
talking to the wood.

06:12.564 --> 06:14.204
That does not sound any better.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.131
Are we sure this is
the safest place to camp?

06:24.167 --> 06:27.935
Because I found a spot on the
map that might be better.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.691
Zuri, you circled
a bed and breakfast.

06:31.416 --> 06:33.641
I just finished digging
the bathroom hole.

06:33.677 --> 06:35.660
And using it.

06:35.695 --> 06:37.320
I couldn't find
any toilet paper,

06:37.355 --> 06:38.513
so I used my socks.

06:41.517 --> 06:45.078
Better than my socks.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.639
Hey, Jorge, why don't you study the
Morse code on the back of this walkie?

06:47.674 --> 06:49.107
And you lost me at study.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.845
Yeah, who studies
on a camping trip?

06:57.367 --> 06:58.887
You sure do know how to party.

06:59.569 --> 07:01.361
Here, go nuts.

07:01.396 --> 07:04.964
Thanks.

07:04.999 --> 07:06.208
Okay, guys. Let's unpack, and then
we'll do a bunch of fun campout stuff.

07:06.243 --> 07:07.692
Fine. Okay.

07:07.727 --> 07:10.087
I'm gonna go hide my socks.

07:12.782 --> 07:16.384
You know, this might be a great
place for a date someday.

07:16.420 --> 07:19.153
It's actually really romantic.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.149
(SNIFFING) You know,
minus the bathroom hole.

07:22.992 --> 07:24.200
Well, maybe once
the kids are in bed,

07:24.236 --> 07:26.444
we can have like
a mini-date out here.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.071
Great idea. Too bad we have a whole
night of activities planned.

07:29.107 --> 07:30.523
Yeah, too bad.

07:35.122 --> 07:38.431
Okay, everyone, dinner time!

07:38.466 --> 07:41.317
Emma, you just let
every hungry animal out here

07:41.352 --> 07:43.904
know exactly where we are.

07:43.939 --> 07:44.971
You can take the big blonde one,

07:45.006 --> 07:46.122
if you let me live!

07:48.151 --> 07:49.968
Why are we
eating dinner so early?

07:50.003 --> 07:52.671
It's still light out.

07:52.706 --> 07:57.075
Um... Because studies show the
better you see your food,

07:57.110 --> 07:58.710
the better you digest it.

07:59.880 --> 08:00.960
That sounds true, right?

08:03.741 --> 08:06.167
Okay everyone,
who wants a s'more dog?

08:06.202 --> 08:08.620
It's dinner
and dessert all in one!

08:08.655 --> 08:10.975
I'm in! It's all going down
the same bathroom hole anyway.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.126
All done! Don't want
to get too full.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.411
Time for the traditional
campout song!

08:16.446 --> 08:17.529
Oh, that's always fun.

08:20.642 --> 08:23.317
<i>¶ This is the Kikiwaka
campout song</i>

08:23.353 --> 08:25.812
<i>¶ So clap your hands
and sing along</i>

08:25.847 --> 08:28.740
<i>¶ You've all been fed
almost time for bed</i>

08:28.775 --> 08:30.575
<i>¶ If you thought there
was more you're wrong ¶</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:34.487
Great song, Xander!

08:34.522 --> 08:39.033
And now, Emma will tell you
all a scary ghost story!

08:39.068 --> 08:42.587
It was a dark
and stormy night...

08:42.623 --> 08:43.997
Blah, blah, blah, she's
been dead for 20 years,

08:44.032 --> 08:44.981
she had a hook for a hand,
and she's right behind you.

08:45.016 --> 08:46.576
(SCREAMS) The end.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.545
Okay, everyone,
time to hit the hay!

08:50.580 --> 08:52.238
Here's to another
great overnight!

08:52.273 --> 08:54.499
Ah, let's do this every year!

08:54.534 --> 08:55.534
(EXCLAIMS)

08:57.779 --> 08:59.896
(SIGHS) Finally,
some alone time.

08:59.931 --> 09:03.391
Hey! Nice try.

09:03.426 --> 09:05.707
Now we're gonna stick to you
like that tick to my butt.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.789
I knew we should've brought
those tranquilizer darts.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.859
(GRUNTING)

09:21.895 --> 09:23.762
Yes, I know Gladys will
be back from town soon,

09:23.797 --> 09:28.049
but I need to use her computer
to find a video to help me.

09:28.084 --> 09:30.543
I have been struggling to decipher
those cursed instructions for hours.

09:30.579 --> 09:32.729
(GRUNTS)

09:32.764 --> 09:36.691
No, we cannot check your
profile on Reptile Romance.

09:36.727 --> 09:38.025
Also, you post too many selfies.

09:38.061 --> 09:39.502
It is a major red flag.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.820
(GRUNTING)

09:42.774 --> 09:46.434
Now, if you see Gladys coming,

09:46.469 --> 09:47.677
just shake what
your momma gave you.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.412
(JINGLING)

09:52.793 --> 09:56.711
Huh, Gladys' cabin is not as
creepy as I thought it would be.

09:59.608 --> 10:00.757
I stand corrected.

10:03.277 --> 10:05.945
A tuft of Mr. Daddy's
chest hair,

10:05.980 --> 10:09.348
a vial of his sweat,

10:09.383 --> 10:12.344
photos of Mrs. Mommy
with her head missing.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.059
Recurring nightmare,
here I come.

10:17.692 --> 10:20.317
(WATER SLOSHING) What the...

10:20.353 --> 10:24.614
Oh, dear, I thought that noise I was hearing
at night was the waves on the lake!

10:27.460 --> 10:30.828
Well, well, well...

10:30.863 --> 10:33.739
Whatcha doing in
<i>la casa del</i> crazy?

10:33.775 --> 10:36.525
Looking for an
instructional video, perhaps?

10:36.560 --> 10:38.728
Just admit my way is better.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.614
Never! What happened to
alerting me, you lazy lizard?

10:41.650 --> 10:42.650
(DINGS)

10:45.061 --> 10:46.602
I bribed her with a dead rat.

10:46.637 --> 10:49.463
She told me everything.

10:49.499 --> 10:52.339
Well, she just hissed a
bunch, but I got the drift.

10:53.369 --> 10:55.445
You carry dead rats on you?

10:55.480 --> 10:57.413
Yep. Everyone always
said it was weird.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.799
Well, not so weird now, is it?

10:59.834 --> 11:00.954
No, it is still very weird.

11:03.346 --> 11:05.438
Now, I bid you a good day!

11:05.473 --> 11:07.115
(WATER SLOSHING)

11:10.879 --> 11:13.237
A little help, so that
I may storm out?

11:13.273 --> 11:15.873
You got it. Cannonball!
(SCREAMS) No!
