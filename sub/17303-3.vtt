Hi, I'm Rory Reid, and welcome to
Extra Gear, the show with a triple-A

00:04.760 --> 00:06.879
backstage pass to all things
Top Gear.

00:06.880 --> 00:10.399
Tonight, Extra Gear gets an
exclusive invite to a secret stash

00:10.400 --> 00:12.439
of cars in Japan.

00:12.440 --> 00:15.880
I have been waiting to do this
all day.

00:16.960 --> 00:20.559
Harris takes a Nissan Nismo 370Z
out for a spin.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.960
Through the follow-through.
Breathe in.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.559
And I'll be joined on the sofa

00:26.560 --> 00:29.079
by gamer-turned-racer
Jann Mardenborough

00:29.080 --> 00:30.879
and comedian Matt Richardson.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.440
That's how we roll.
This is Extra Gear.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:55.400 --> 00:58.879
Let's get our guests out. First up
is a man who was so good on the

00:58.880 --> 01:02.679
PlayStation that Nissan gave him
a job as a real racing driver.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.040
It's Jann Mardenborough.

01:06.440 --> 01:09.079
All right? All right?
Take a seat.

01:09.080 --> 01:12.160
And a man who knows all about
drive-time, it's Matt Richardson.

01:19.040 --> 01:20.799
So, Jann, thanks for joining us.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.479
You've flown in all the way from
Japan to be here, right?

01:23.480 --> 01:26.799
Yeah, I got in yesterday,
three o'clock.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.999
Wow. So, a bit tired.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.439
Bags under the eyes. But make-up
solved that for me.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.039
But you hold the record now for the
person who has flown the longest to

01:35.040 --> 01:36.719
be on Extra Gear,
so congratulations.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.079
Sweet. Matt, have you been to Japan?

01:39.080 --> 01:43.319
I've never been to Japan and I came
from Zone 3, so, it's...

01:43.320 --> 01:44.599
Never been inclined to visit?

01:44.600 --> 01:47.279
I don't speak Japanese so I don't
think my comedy would go down

01:47.280 --> 01:48.719
that well there. And, you know,

01:48.720 --> 01:51.479
I'm not a racing driver, so I don't
get to be as rock and roll.

01:51.480 --> 01:53.919
Jann, you actually race in Japan.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.119
Your path into motorsport wasn't
exactly traditional, was it?

01:58.120 --> 02:01.679
I started to get into motorsport
through gaming.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.759
So, I won a competition back in 2011
called GT Academy.

02:06.760 --> 02:11.119
So, they find the fastest people
on the racing game Gran Turismo,

02:11.120 --> 02:16.719
the main prize is a professional
drive in Dubai, and Nissan said,

02:16.720 --> 02:20.919
"OK, yeah, you did well, we'll
give you a contract for 2013."

02:20.920 --> 02:24.199
And then it's just kind of like
carried on since then.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.799
So... Yeah, it's an amazing story
but I want to know

02:26.800 --> 02:28.479
about the process. To qualify,

02:28.480 --> 02:31.239
I was in my room a minimum
six hours a day, every day.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.759
I was when I was a teenager as well,
but not playing games.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.240
Other reasons.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.839
So, you went to Brands Hatch
and then Silverstone.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.799
You won the big final race of GT
Academy and you're on the big podium

02:44.800 --> 02:47.039
step at Silverstone,
you've got Johnny Herbert,

02:47.040 --> 02:48.479
you've got Eddie Irvine with you.

02:48.480 --> 02:51.119
Yeah. He announced that
I was the champion but his accent,

02:51.120 --> 02:54.799
he's from Ireland, and
it's so strong and he talks so fast.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.879
He said, "Not only Jann's the winner
of the race,

02:56.880 --> 03:00.559
"but winner of GT Academy." And
then, like, I couldn't understand
what he was on about.

03:00.560 --> 03:03.239
You were like, "Eh, what?" And then
there was champagne from the

03:03.240 --> 03:05.999
competitors, from, like, second and
third were spraying at me and I

03:06.000 --> 03:07.399
was like, "Oh, I won."

03:07.400 --> 03:10.879
We actually have a clip of you
telling your mum that you've won.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.360
So, let's take a look at that.

03:14.200 --> 03:17.520
Hello. Yeah, I've kind of won
GT Academy.

03:29.400 --> 03:32.399
All of those hours in your bedroom
finally paid off and now you compete

03:32.400 --> 03:34.399
in Super GT 500.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.279
We'll come back and we'll talk a bit
more about your racing in a minute.

03:37.280 --> 03:40.760
But now we're going to head to Japan
in search of a 1960s icon.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.000
This is Zama, Kanagawa Prefecture.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.320
A sleepy town about
25 miles west of Tokyo.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.840
Home to Camp Zama military base...

04:00.280 --> 04:02.400
..and Nissan's operations centre.

04:04.280 --> 04:08.720
It's safe to say that Zama is not
a fixture on Japan's tourist trail.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.080
But there is more to Zama
than initially meets the eye.

04:14.680 --> 04:17.159
Here, behind tight security,

04:17.160 --> 04:20.880
is one of the most comprehensive
heritage collections in the world.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.720
Nissan's DNA Garage is not open
to the public.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.639
You have to be invited.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.760
Luckily, we were.

04:47.720 --> 04:52.199
The secret stash includes cars that
date back to the company's inception

04:52.200 --> 04:53.760
in 1933.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.079
Cars like Nissan's first
electric vehicle, the Tama,

05:00.080 --> 05:03.840
and more magical Nismo machinery
than can ever be imagined.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.119
But, as impressive as all of this
is, I'm here for something specific.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.959
You might remember the Nissan 240Z,
the grandfather of all Z-cars.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.039
Here in Japan,
it's known as the Fairlady Z.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.959
It was built in 1969 as a rival
for the Ford Mustang, Chevy Camaro,

05:24.960 --> 05:27.279
and indeed, the Jaguar E-Type.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.399
And inside this factory, there lives
and ultra-rare, high-performance

05:31.400 --> 05:35.200
version known as the Fairlady Z432.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.320
This is it.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.879
They only ever made 420 of these and
they only ever sold them here in

05:51.880 --> 05:57.239
Japan. The Z432 used the same engine
that you found in the

05:57.240 --> 06:02.280
Skyline 2000 GT-R, a two-litre,
six-cylinder S20 engine.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.719
Now, that was like taking a Porsche
911 engine and stuffing it into a

06:07.720 --> 06:11.799
Porsche Boxster. The standard
Fairlady Z was no slouch,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.919
but in this, Nissan created
something truly special -

06:14.920 --> 06:17.600
a Z-car with the heart of a GT-R.

06:25.920 --> 06:31.880
If the Z432 was rare in 1969, it has
since become a bit of a unicorn.

06:34.400 --> 06:37.760
There are only around 100
rumoured to be in existence...

06:40.680 --> 06:44.400
..with many in a condition
most consider beyond salvage.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.999
There is one man who has dedicated
his career to hunting down the

06:51.000 --> 06:55.639
mythical beast. A man who has become
a bit of a unicorn himself -

06:55.640 --> 06:59.440
one of only two people to still
restore these cars by hand.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.759
It's here that collectors of these
rare Nissans go to bring their

07:04.760 --> 07:06.280
Fairladys back to life.

07:07.720 --> 07:09.759
And I've come to meet Tadashi Ando,

07:09.760 --> 07:14.359
the man who has dedicated 30 years
of his life to preserving so many

07:14.360 --> 07:18.240
432s, to find out what makes
this car so special.

08:03.200 --> 08:07.280
Why is it so important to you that
these cars are restored properly?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.239
I know they're incredibly rare

08:40.240 --> 08:42.599
but do you reckon maybe I could have
a go in one?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.840
Yes. Yeah?

08:47.880 --> 08:51.200
I have been waiting to do this
all day.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.639
The first thing that hits you
is that sound.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.399
The noise from that straight six
just resonates around the cabin,

09:05.400 --> 09:08.199
forcing its way out through those

09:08.200 --> 09:11.679
twin vertically-mounted pipes
at the rear.

09:11.680 --> 09:13.320
It sounds fantastic.

09:14.920 --> 09:19.279
The basic 240Z came with a two-litre
engine that made about 130

09:19.280 --> 09:24.679
horsepower. The GT-R engine in this,
the S20, makes 160.

09:24.680 --> 09:28.679
That doesn't sound like an awful lot
but the car only weighs 1,000kg,

09:28.680 --> 09:30.999
so it does shift.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.599
You've got to remember
that in the late '60s, early '70s,

09:34.600 --> 09:36.959
this was cutting-edge performance.

09:36.960 --> 09:39.999
And even by today's standards,
I mean, it's still fun.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.799
Trust me.

09:41.800 --> 09:47.199
Peak power comes in at 7000rpm,
so it does pay to wring it out.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.600
Be a bit of a hooligan.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.680
Oh, yes.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.599
Growing up, so many young men and
women kind of fantasised about

10:02.600 --> 10:06.039
owning an old Mustang, or maybe a
Jaguar E-Type,

10:06.040 --> 10:07.879
a Corvette in my case,

10:07.880 --> 10:13.519
and probably dismissed the 240Z as a
sports car that they aspired to own.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.919
And maybe I'm a little bit guilty
of that myself,

10:15.920 --> 10:21.159
but here I am in Japan
driving it for myself,

10:21.160 --> 10:22.679
and I feel a connection to it.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.999
I feel like I should have paid
more attention to this thing,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.560
especially in this form.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.359
How would I sum this up? I mean,
I'm kind of at a loss for words.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.519
I can describe it for you, but it
doesn't quite explain how it feels.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.559
And the best way I can describe it
to you is that it's special.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.240
That's what it is -
the 432 is special.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.679
It's a really special car.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.879
Amazing thing.
You've been to Zama, right?

10:59.880 --> 11:02.320
Yeah, quite a few times.
Have you driven anything there?

11:03.800 --> 11:07.719
Well, yeah, at Nismo Festival they
have a load of the old race cars.

11:07.720 --> 11:10.999
They take them out from Zama
and bring them to the track,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.559
so I've raced quite a few
of the race cars.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.919
Tell us about your Super GT car.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.959
So, the car is a Nissan GT-R.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.559
But the only thing that's... We've
got a picture of it right here.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.679
Yeah. So, the only thing that's the
same as the road car and the

11:25.680 --> 11:29.079
race car is the roof-line
and the rear lights.

11:29.080 --> 11:31.879
Everything else is completely
custom -

11:31.880 --> 11:35.279
different engine, four-cylinder,
two-litre 600...

11:35.280 --> 11:38.039
They don't actually tell us the
numbers of the engine but it's

11:38.040 --> 11:40.319
probably between 650 and
700 horsepower.

11:40.320 --> 11:43.199
But this is serious racing, though.
There are big names in this series.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.559
Yeah, man. It's, like, this
championship is properly cool.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.239
The cars are cool, the championship
is run very well and we have
drivers,

11:51.240 --> 11:56.079
ex-F1 drivers - Jenson Button's
doing it this year with Honda,

11:56.080 --> 11:59.319
Kamui Kobayashi is racing for Lexus.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.119
There's another one... Heikki
Kovalainen. Kovalainen for

12:02.120 --> 12:04.599
Lexus as well. Have you come up
against them already?

12:04.600 --> 12:09.919
Yeah. So, I've raced against
all of them actually last year.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.399
I think it was at Fuji and I was
sort of battling with Kovalainen,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.679
and it's like this guy was
a McLaren driver.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.159
You know, like, this is cool.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.999
Well, you might not remember,
but I actually raced against you

12:21.000 --> 12:23.559
at Le Mans
when you were doing GT Academy.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.999
You didn't know who I was,
but I knew who YOU were. Yeah.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.159
And we were in some go-karts and
I thought... I saw you whizz by me,

12:29.160 --> 12:33.079
and I thought, "I'm not letting him
get away, I'm going to hang onto the
back of him."

12:33.080 --> 12:35.359
This guy disappeared on me.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.679
Unbelievable.
Speaking of dream cars, though,

12:37.680 --> 12:38.839
what do you aspire to own?

12:38.840 --> 12:42.279
So, I'd quite like, I mean,
an Aston Martin would be the dream.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.679
There's someone on my street
that's got a really nice one.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.759
And I always wanted a really nice
black one.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.439
Or, I quite like a Porsche Cayenne.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.039
No, no, I said DREAM car.

12:51.040 --> 12:53.279
Yeah, Porsche Cayenne,
I think they're really cool.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.959
So, tell me about your car history.

12:54.960 --> 13:00.199
What have you owned? I started out,
I had a Peugeot 106 1.2 litre.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.879
Ladies. And then I had
a much sexier car.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.879
I went for the Fiat Grande Punto.

13:06.880 --> 13:09.439
The Grande Punto?

13:09.440 --> 13:12.759
The Grande Pun...
The Grande's important.

13:12.760 --> 13:16.999
And then...
I've got a Mercedes E250 now.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.119
So it was like not that good,
not that good, and then OK.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.799
Yeah, and that's it.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.359
That's my car there.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.799
Where did you get that from?
I bought it off my dad.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.079
Because I decided a 56-year-old man
shouldn't be driving a white

13:31.080 --> 13:33.600
Mercedes,
because that is a midlife crisis.

13:35.400 --> 13:36.879
It's nice, I like it. It's good.

13:36.880 --> 13:39.439
You and Jann actually have something
in common, don't you?

13:39.440 --> 13:42.759
You're into your gaming as well.
I'm into my gaming, yeah.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.319
I'm not so much into car gaming.

13:44.320 --> 13:48.319
I used to play for hours a day -
Flight Simulator.

13:48.320 --> 13:52.199
What Flight Simulator is -
you're thinking, "That's exciting,
fighter jets, things like that."

13:52.200 --> 13:54.279
Commercial aviation.

13:54.280 --> 13:58.319
My dream job was a pilot so I used
to play Flight Simulator and I have

13:58.320 --> 14:00.759
like a proper yoke, like,
you know, a flight...

14:00.760 --> 14:04.399
..a flying yoke and the pedals and
everything attached to my desk.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.959
Not any more because I've just
moved in with my girlfriend and she

14:06.960 --> 14:08.479
threw it out.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.279
You should tell her the Jann
Mardenborough story -

14:11.280 --> 14:12.759
you plug away on your console...

14:12.760 --> 14:15.839
Yeah, but I'd be like, "One day I'll
be a real pilot." I don't think BA

14:15.840 --> 14:20.159
go, "Hey, guys, who's playing Flight
Simulator? Let's get them to be a
pilot now."

14:20.160 --> 14:24.399
But I used to do the flight from
London to New York in a 747

14:24.400 --> 14:26.200
in real-time.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.079
What's that, eight hours?

14:29.080 --> 14:31.920
Eight hours, depending on what
you set the weather to be.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.079
Hang on... Because, you know,
it gets pretty boring if,

14:36.080 --> 14:38.359
halfway through, there's not a bit
of turbulence.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.839
If there is turbulence, you could
click the seat belt signs to go on.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.279
I used to put...

14:43.280 --> 14:46.679
Right, I used to put films on and
I'd pretend that they were the films

14:46.680 --> 14:49.360
being shown on the in-flight
entertainment system.

14:51.040 --> 14:54.560
And I lost my virginity
as late as you'd imagine.

14:55.800 --> 14:58.719
But, yeah, yeah,
that was my gaming history.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.919
You're so much cooler than me.
That's pretty cool, you know. Like,
having your own... It's not cool.

15:02.920 --> 15:06.519
Thank you. Bless your heart for
going, "That's very cool of you
sitting in your room..."

15:06.520 --> 15:09.279
The eight-hour thing sitting on
the plane watching your own...

15:09.280 --> 15:11.559
That's... You know what,
but you set the weather,

15:11.560 --> 15:13.639
so it can make it a bit interesting.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.480
And then your foggy landing at JFK,
there's nothing more thrilling.

15:18.120 --> 15:22.519
You say that but Jann actually had a
go in a slightly different simulator

15:22.520 --> 15:24.719
recently... Yeah. ..and it was
a lot more thrilling.

15:24.720 --> 15:25.960
Let's take a look.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.160
No way.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.160
Oh!

16:28.520 --> 16:32.479
A little bit cooler. A little bit
cooler. You're living this life -

16:32.480 --> 16:35.399
I did a gig to 25 people in Stoke
two days ago,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.720
so who's having a better career?

16:39.000 --> 16:41.079
That's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.639
Thanks, man. A bit cooler
than flying imaginary planes.

16:43.640 --> 16:46.959
Yeah, I mean, he's in an actual
helicopter driving a sports car.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.239
Were you worried about doing that,
Jann, at all?

16:49.240 --> 16:51.799
Shitting myself. Why?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.599
If you crashed it, you don't die.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.519
It's perfect. That thing was fine,
but the helicopter,

16:56.520 --> 16:57.799
being in a helicopter...

16:57.800 --> 16:59.559
Did you not like? Nah, man.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.399
It was mad. The guy was...

17:01.400 --> 17:03.599
The pilot was really good
and, you know,

17:03.600 --> 17:05.118
he was calming me down and stuff.

17:05.119 --> 17:08.358
But I think when I was sort of
focusing on the car,

17:08.359 --> 17:11.519
cos I'm trying to look at the car
while the thing's doing these mad

17:11.520 --> 17:14.519
turns and stuff,
and it has like a glass floor.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.479
Yeah. But sometimes he would have to
cut the track and the car's like

17:18.480 --> 17:21.398
here, and I can't see anything,
I can't even see the car,

17:21.400 --> 17:23.839
I'm meant to be controlling it,
I can't see anything.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.159
I've no sympathy.

17:25.160 --> 17:27.319
You have the coolest life
I've ever known.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.879
Absolutely.

17:28.880 --> 17:30.359
Well, earlier on, Matt,

17:30.360 --> 17:33.919
Jann and myself went head-to-head
around Suzuka in our very own

17:33.920 --> 17:36.120
GT Academy. Let's take a look.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.560
I can't mess this up.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.040
I've gone in too deep.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.960
Perfect start.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.160
Stressful.

17:53.320 --> 17:54.680
Oh, yes.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.839
Whoa!

17:58.840 --> 18:00.399
Finish.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.999
And we're off.

18:02.000 --> 18:04.119
Oh! Straight into a wall.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.080
That did not go well. Dab of brakes.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.359
Dab of opposite lock.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.359
Dab of dirt.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.839
That's gone wrong.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.560
That's gone wrong. Oh!

18:16.200 --> 18:18.639
I meant that.
Couple of problems here -

18:18.640 --> 18:21.800
I don't know this track,
I never play this game...

18:23.560 --> 18:24.800
..and I'm rubbish.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.800
Lovely. OK.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.439
I'm so bad at this.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.920
How have I put my...?
I've put my hazard lights on.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.879
Right, now I'm in the swing of it,
this is going to be good.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.479
Oh, yeah, of course, brilliant.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.040
I hope my insurance company
aren't watching this.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.160
I mean, that was horrific.

18:56.520 --> 18:59.240
Cheers. That was BLEEP pathetic.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.919
OK. All right,
I have the lap times here.

19:05.920 --> 19:08.040
Who's your money on? Jann?

19:09.080 --> 19:10.360
I'm still driving it!

19:12.600 --> 19:17.480
OK, let's see. Jann, obviously you
were the fastest by some margin.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.760
Your best lap was lap two,
at 2:23.50.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.440
I did it in a 3:10.50.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.359
No, I don't even want to know.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.399
I mean,
four hours and three seconds.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.079
It's not as bad as you think. You
were only four seconds behind me.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.159
Was I? I mean, that's a lifetime
in real life,

19:38.160 --> 19:40.519
But in a game
it's not too bad. Yeah, yeah.

19:40.520 --> 19:43.999
Although your worst lap
was a 3:47, which is...

19:44.000 --> 19:46.919
I've never been to Japan before.
I just wanted to see the scenery.

19:46.920 --> 19:51.039
You were in this room!
All right, congratulations, guys.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.079
The winner, Jann Mardenborough.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.320
Thank you.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.599
Now, we're off for another lap, but
this time it's on British turf -

20:00.600 --> 20:03.880
Chris Harris hits the track
in a Nissan 370Z.

20:09.200 --> 20:13.199
The car revs out to about 7,500, but
beyond about 6,800,

20:13.200 --> 20:17.479
it's kind of had enough.
It's a bit asthmatic, this engine.

20:17.480 --> 20:21.879
I mean, it offers about 35
horsepower more than a standard 370Z

20:21.880 --> 20:25.479
but it doesn't feel dramatically
faster if I'm being honest with you.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.079
The main thing about the Nismo
package is the handling,

20:28.080 --> 20:32.199
so we've got better brakes, we've
got better dampers, stiffer springs.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.239
Everything's a bit different,
a bit racier.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.280
And through here...

20:36.640 --> 20:38.000
..it feels great fun.

20:40.080 --> 20:44.399
Power, 344, torque, 274,

20:44.400 --> 20:47.599
top speed, 155, 0-62,

20:47.600 --> 20:49.119
five and a bit seconds.

20:49.120 --> 20:53.039
I mean, those are quite good numbers
for back in the day, but these days,

20:53.040 --> 20:56.599
you know, everything's got a bit
stronger and a bit punchier.

20:56.600 --> 21:02.359
So, I have to say, it doesn't
feel that fast any more.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.239
It's a nicely-balanced car.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.199
It's quite heavy too -

21:06.200 --> 21:08.559
it's nearly 1.5 tonnes.

21:08.560 --> 21:10.759
What's it like through here
if we give it a flick?

21:10.760 --> 21:13.440
A lot of understeer.
A lot of safety understeer.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.639
Through the Follow Through.

21:16.640 --> 21:17.680
Breathe in!

21:20.520 --> 21:22.239
I do like this track.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.959
Braking. Braking's pretty good,
but again there's a little bit

21:25.960 --> 21:27.399
of squidge in the end of the pedal.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.559
Everything feels like it's sort of
rubber-bushed

21:29.560 --> 21:32.719
and a little bit indirect
on the car.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.319
But the Z-cars, yeah, they need
some more concentration,

21:35.320 --> 21:36.520
some more effort.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.560
Over the line.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.039
Great lap, as always.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.039
I mean, Chris, he was kind of
on the fence with it.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.439
He was saying not enough power,
too much understeer.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.919
You actually have one of these cars,
though, don't you?

21:52.920 --> 21:55.879
Yeah, it kind of hurt a little bit,
some of the stuff he was saying.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.599
Do you disagree?

21:57.600 --> 22:01.039
There's some bits I do agree, I do
agree that it's, you know, it is,

22:01.040 --> 22:04.039
it is getting on.
It's quite an old car.

22:04.040 --> 22:08.639
But I have one and I do like the
fact that it does feel kind of

22:08.640 --> 22:14.079
old school. Like, it's heavy
steering, the manual gearbox,

22:14.080 --> 22:17.079
you have to be quite precise on it,
the clutch is quite heavy.

22:17.080 --> 22:18.719
Yeah.

22:18.720 --> 22:23.999
When I drive it, it's fun,
and on wet roundabouts, it's mint.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.999
Yeah. Matt, you're no stranger
to Dunsfold. I hear you've actually
visited the track.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.999
I've done, you know, where you pay
to go and drive supercars

22:32.000 --> 22:35.559
for the day. So, we paid and drove
an Aston Martin DB9

22:35.560 --> 22:38.879
and a Ferrari Spider,

22:38.880 --> 22:41.439
which was great. I promised my dad
when I started doing comedy,

22:41.440 --> 22:45.039
I was like, "When I'm famous, I'm
going to buy you an Aston Martin."

22:45.040 --> 22:47.559
And then last year I reassessed
where my career was and I went,

22:47.560 --> 22:49.640
"How about we do a lap
in an Aston Martin?"

22:51.360 --> 22:54.239
But, yeah, I have driven that track
and it's a nice track.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.319
The lady who was in the car
with me who was, like,

22:56.320 --> 22:57.479
the professional driver,

22:57.480 --> 23:01.199
she then took me round for a spin
and I screamed because she was

23:01.200 --> 23:04.879
really fast. Whereas
I was driving very responsibly.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.799
And on that note,
it's time to wrap this up.

23:06.800 --> 23:10.079
Thank you to our guests, Jann
Mardenborough and Matt Richardson.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.400
Round of applause, please.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.479
I'll be back next week
for more Extra Gear.

23:16.480 --> 23:17.840
See you then. Goodnight.
