WEBVTT

00:06.297 --> 00:08.173
Oh, oh, cannot go,
you can't go in there.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.259
- Why?
- Vince is in there.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.761
Oh. Tina, are you kidding me?

00:11.845 --> 00:14.055
It's no big deal. I love Ben.

00:14.139 --> 00:17.267
I had one little dream
about kissing Vince, who cares?

00:17.350 --> 00:20.270
Last night, I dreamt I was naked
on a train going into a tunnel.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.355
What are you gonna tell me,
that was a sex dream, too?

00:27.152 --> 00:29.070
Happy almost grand opening!

00:29.154 --> 00:30.530
Shh! We're having a taste test.

00:30.613 --> 00:31.781
Okay, which one
do you like better

00:31.865 --> 00:34.117
the devil's food,
or the coconut swirl?

00:35.201 --> 00:36.661
I don't know.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.497
I think we're gonna have
to try another one, Mr. Gary.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.707
Heck no!

00:40.790 --> 00:42.625
Choose!

00:42.709 --> 00:45.295
Mmm! The chocolate chip one
is a dream.

00:45.378 --> 00:48.423
Will you shut up
about dreams? I love Ben.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.050
- What?
- Oh.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.218
I-I'm just talking to Tina

00:52.302 --> 00:54.971
about how much
I'm loving on Ben.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.139
Yeah. Who cares?

00:56.222 --> 00:57.223
I got a food critic coming here

00:57.307 --> 00:58.767
in half an hour whose review

00:58.850 --> 01:00.143
could make or break this bakery.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.603
And I've got no one helping me.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.897
- Lauren, get out here!
- 'I don't want to!'

01:03.980 --> 01:05.230
Lauren!

01:08.693 --> 01:10.361
I look ridiculous.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.530
[laughing]

01:12.614 --> 01:14.407
That's 'cause you're not
wearing the cherry.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.412
Holly.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.414
Will you please let your sister
know that if we wanna draw in

01:21.498 --> 01:23.666
customers, we should
be showing off these cupcakes.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.711
- It would be so easy--'
- 'Lauren!'

01:26.795 --> 01:27.837
A tap-dancing cupcake

01:27.921 --> 01:29.964
outside a bakery
will bring people in.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.382
You will look adorable

01:31.466 --> 01:32.801
as soon as you learn
how to do this.

01:38.431 --> 01:41.601
Okay, I'm embarrassed,
to be standing next to you.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.895
I know. I realize the irony.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.817
Hey! So, do you guys wanna
come watch Ben sing tonight?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.151
Actually, I-I kinda have--

01:50.235 --> 01:51.861
With his new partner Amber?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.030
Got to come!

01:54.113 --> 01:56.741
I'm setting up a showcase
for them tonight at Skids.

01:56.825 --> 01:58.535
Since when does Ben
have a singing partner?

01:58.618 --> 02:00.578
Since the management firm
thought that his sound

02:00.662 --> 02:03.039
could use a nice pair of boobs.

02:03.122 --> 02:07.043
Man, forget the cupcakes.
I'd like a slice of Amber-pie

02:07.126 --> 02:10.380
with a big scoop
of chocolate-Gary, on top.

02:12.131 --> 02:13.424
So, Vince and I

02:13.508 --> 02:15.468
will be meeting you tonight
at the showcase

02:15.552 --> 02:17.095
you know, to support Ben.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.351
Wow, she really is hot.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.270
You know, I wouldn't want
my boyfriend standing

02:25.353 --> 02:27.564
next to that thing
acting all sexy.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.525
Yeah, but you're not well.

02:30.608 --> 02:33.611
Me, I am so confident
about my relationship with Ben

02:33.695 --> 02:35.071
that I don't get jealous.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.865
That, Tina, is true love.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.242
Mm-hmm. That,
Holly, is true bull.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.411
When you really
are in love with someone

02:41.494 --> 02:43.246
you can't help
but be jealous.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.457
[chuckles]
Okay, little Tina "One date."

02:46.541 --> 02:48.501
Someday, when you're
in a relationship

02:48.585 --> 02:51.921
where you actually know the
fella's last name, we'll talk.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.256
Okay, Little Miss Confidence.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.549
Did you ever think
that maybe you're not

02:54.632 --> 02:56.134
so sure about Ben and maybe

02:56.217 --> 02:58.428
that's why you keep
having dreams about Vince?

02:58.511 --> 03:01.598
Okay, you thought
that Condoleezza Rice

03:01.681 --> 03:04.100
was something you ordered
at a Chinese restaurant.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.727
And I'm supposed
to listen to you?

get into the cupcake business?

04:29.477 --> 04:31.688
Oh, well, um,
I was in PR

04:31.771 --> 04:33.773
but my business fell apart
after I called off my wedding

04:33.856 --> 04:35.441
at which point,
I had a little breakdown..

04:36.776 --> 04:39.487
Just put down
that I've always liked cupcakes.

04:39.570 --> 04:43.074
[bell dings]
Ooh, there's a batch
of our mocha cupcakes.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.826
- My grandmother's recipe.
- Hmm.

She used them to escape

we get a good review, Alan.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.199
Well, that certainly
could be possible.

05:25.283 --> 05:30.121
Oh? Anything I could do
to make it really possible?

05:30.204 --> 05:33.082
Yeah. Get me a date
with your boss.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.586
Ha-ha! I would love..
Not me?

05:36.669 --> 05:38.921
- She's really hot.
- Trust me, she would never--

05:39.005 --> 05:41.549
It would definitely inspire me
to write a good review.

05:41.632 --> 05:42.759

Well, what are we,
Keebler Elves? Huh!

06:52.578 --> 06:54.997
We deserve a night out.
We're celebrating, you know?

06:55.081 --> 06:57.792
A couple of crazy bakers,
out on the town.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.253
Yeah, go nuts.
Let your hair nets down.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.004
Okay.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.507
She's right. This is ridiculous.
We have so much work to do.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.676
Oh, will you just sit down
and relax

07:06.759 --> 07:08.344
and slap on a little lipstick?

07:08.427 --> 07:09.345
Why?

07:09.428 --> 07:11.180
Oh, because it's almost
eight o'clock.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.807
And I like it,
when you look pretty.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.604
Oh, my God.
Well, look who's here.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.315
It is Alan Lloyd,
the food critic.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.360
What are you doing?

07:24.443 --> 07:26.529
Alan, hi. Oh, my God!

07:26.612 --> 07:28.823
- Won't you come join us?
- Hey.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.576
Hello, Val.
Nice to see you again.

07:31.659 --> 07:35.746
Huh, wow, look at the time.
I have to be up at 5:00. See ya!

07:35.830 --> 07:37.415
Lauren, Lauren!

07:37.498 --> 07:38.708
[chuckles]

07:38.791 --> 07:41.210
I'm gonna have to do random drug
testing at work.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.588
Can I get you a drink?

07:43.671 --> 07:47.216
Oh, no, um, actually, I have to
get up early tomorrow.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.595
Yeah, yeah, me too.
Writing your review.

07:51.596 --> 07:55.057
Mmm, you smell really good.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.267
What is that?

07:56.350 --> 07:59.645

vanilla and cinnamon

07:59.729 --> 08:01.063

08:02.607 --> 08:04.358
I've been baking all day.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.776
Yeah.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.321
You're a little baking girl,
aren't you?

08:08.404 --> 08:10.448
Are you a naughty
little baking girl?

08:12.033 --> 08:15.077
- Excuse me?
- Just having a little fun.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.204
Seriously,
let's get outta here.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.747
I live a few blocks away..

08:19.165 --> 08:22.043
Okay, Mr. Lloyd, I think
you have the wrong idea.

08:22.126 --> 08:24.420
Well-well, wait a minute.
Don't you want the good review?

08:24.503 --> 08:26.631
I mean,
this was the deal, right?

08:26.714 --> 08:28.132
"Deal?"

08:28.216 --> 08:30.218
Did-did you not talk
to your assistant?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.638
Oh, my God,
this was a setup.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.306
So she did talk to you.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.726
Eww!

08:40.019 --> 08:43.188
So you're saying if I..

08:43.272 --> 08:45.816
...make a little time with you

08:45.900 --> 08:47.276
you're gonna give me
a good review?

08:48.402 --> 08:50.154
I would never say that.

08:51.530 --> 08:52.823
Legal reasons.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.286
Oh, my God, would you

11:02.161 --> 11:03.245
[laughing]

11:03.329 --> 11:05.831
Oh, my gosh, we rock.
Cheese doodle?

11:05.915 --> 11:09.251
Oh, no thanks. The doodle dust
makes my guitar orange.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.296
Oh, you guys sound great.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.799
Way better than that whiny crap
you usually play.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.511
Oh, yeah, thanks, mate,
that's what I was going for.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.554
Aww.

11:20.638 --> 11:23.057
Uh, we never got to meet
last night.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.767
- I'm Amber.
- Vince.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.310
Oh, sorry about that.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.106
Mmm. It's okay.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.655
So, what's it like
living with him?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.536
I imagine it's a lot like living
with the queen.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.456
It sucks he has a girlfriend.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.417
Who Vince? No. Vince
doesn't have a girlfriend.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.419
- Holly said he did.
- What?

11:51.502 --> 11:53.295
Yeah, last night at the club,
I asked about him

11:53.379 --> 11:55.506
and she said
he was totally taken.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.800
Oh, she must've misunderstood.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.427
He's, uh, quite available.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.512
I'm sure if he knew
that you were interest..

12:04.056 --> 12:05.558
More doodles, Vince?

12:11.605 --> 12:12.898
Later, dude.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.026
- Holly.
- Hey, Vince.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.653
Everywhere I go, there's Vince.

12:17.736 --> 12:19.029
Vince, Vince, Vince.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.198
Well, I'm here
to see my boyfriend.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.908
See you later.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.494
You know, there was a time
when I lived here by myself.

12:26.370 --> 12:28.247
I miss those days.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.041
- Hey. How's it going?
- Great.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.543
Hey, Holly, what's the deal?

12:32.626 --> 12:34.044
You said Vince has a girlfriend

12:34.128 --> 12:35.713
and Ben says he doesn't.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.384
No. What?

12:41.051 --> 12:42.595
I-I said that?

12:42.678 --> 12:44.388
Yeah, last night at the club,
I asked you about him

12:44.472 --> 12:46.015
and you said
he was totally taken.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.143
Oh, no, see, last night,
when she asked

12:49.226 --> 12:53.355
I had thought you were asking
if he was totally Jewish.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.232
Because you only dated
Jewish guys?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.485
No? Oh, okay, well, he's not.
So go for it!

12:57.568 --> 12:59.862
Yeah, I hope the two of you
work out! Mazel tov!

13:00.905 --> 13:01.906
You know,
I-I think Vince and Amber

13:01.989 --> 13:03.157
would make
a really great couple.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.534
- You should set that up.
- Good.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.536
Good idea!

13:07.620 --> 13:09.163
In fact, we could double.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.539
Me and Vince
and you and Amber.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.374
I mean, me and Amber
and you and Vince.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.418
We all know who goes together.
Mazel tov!

13:15.628 --> 13:17.463
[instrumental music]

13:20.674 --> 13:21.967
Yeah, you're right, Val.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.761
At least we still
have our dignity.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.140
I still think I made
the right decision.

13:28.224 --> 13:29.099
Oh, yeah?

13:29.183 --> 13:30.184
Well, let's see how much dignity

13:30.267 --> 13:32.144
we've got in the cash register.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.646
Ow.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.441
We've been open four hours,
and we have sold three cupcakes.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.443
To each other!

13:39.527 --> 13:41.862
And we should be proud.
They're delicious.

13:41.946 --> 13:46.367
Well, not according to our
sexually frustrated reviewer.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.410
"The cupcakes
at Sugar Babies Bakery

13:48.494 --> 13:52.665
are tasteless and dried up,
much like the owners."

13:52.748 --> 13:57.169
God! Couldn't you have just let
Alan Lloyd cop one little feel?

13:57.253 --> 14:00.464
I am sorry. That is not
how Val Tyler does business.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.383
'I have done everything,
I posted flyers'

14:02.466 --> 14:04.635
I took out ads,
I sent cupcake baskets

14:04.718 --> 14:06.387
to every business
on this street.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.348
We do not have to resort to
using our bodies, to get ahead.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.102
Wake up, Bambi!

14:13.185 --> 14:15.229
This is how things work
in the forest!

14:16.021 --> 14:18.023
Not in my forest.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.316
And don't make that dirty.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.611
Lauren, take a look
around this place.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.197
Do you remember
why we picked a '60s theme?

14:25.281 --> 14:27.616
It was the time
of the women's movement.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.368
Female empowerment.

14:29.451 --> 14:30.619
Great. Okay.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.288
We'll sell tasteless
and dried-up

14:32.371 --> 14:34.123
women's movement cupcakes.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.960
Why don't we just open up
a lesbian bookstore?

14:39.628 --> 14:42.464
Well, I don't care if this place
goes down in flames.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.966
I will never resort to this!

14:44.049 --> 14:47.386
Hey, fellas, take a look
at these "C" cupcakes!

14:49.221 --> 14:50.431
Want a bite outta this?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.102
Look at them.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.478
You disgust me!

14:58.731 --> 15:01.400
If this is what I have to do
to succeed in this business

15:01.483 --> 15:02.985
then I don't want
any part of it.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.408
[instrumental music]

15:16.749 --> 15:18.834
[instrumental music]

15:22.171 --> 15:24.757
So...you and Amber, huh?

15:24.840 --> 15:26.842
I'm sensing sparks.

15:26.925 --> 15:28.427
She's okay.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.139
I am so lame.
I don't know what I'm doing.

15:32.222 --> 15:35.267
Vince, she's lame.
Why don't you go help her?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.852
[music continues]

15:40.105 --> 15:43.984
[sighs]
God! They make
such a cute couple.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.320
Well, not as cute as us,
of course.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.032
'Cause we are in L-O-V-E.

15:50.115 --> 15:53.786
And I think you are
I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.290
- "Incredible."
- Oh. Thanks.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.334
Aw, I love
having a smart boyfriend.

16:01.502 --> 16:05.547
[chuckles]
I told you, I am terrible.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.299
Well, but you know what?
It doesn't matter.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.842
Because you happen
to be standing next

16:08.926 --> 16:10.511
to one of the greatest teachers.

16:10.594 --> 16:12.638
Vince, can teach you anything.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.390
Yeah, if you don't mind
broken toes.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.559
What?

16:17.643 --> 16:20.062
Oh, it's another one
of their private little jokes.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.022
I choose to find them charming.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.902
- Come on, tell me, tell me.
- Yes, please, do tell us.

16:26.985 --> 16:28.320
I'm just gonna stay seated
over here

16:28.404 --> 16:29.905
as you do tend to go on.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.660
Okay. We're in Paris,
at this cool outdoor concert.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.078
People were dancing
in the gardens.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.705
But, remember, this is France

16:37.788 --> 16:39.456
so we've already had
half a bottle of wine.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.419
Totally legal. Oh, wait,
my sister's not here.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.586
(Vince)
'Anyway, Holly's like'

16:44.670 --> 16:46.797
"It's Paris. It's romantic.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.132
Let's dance."

16:48.215 --> 16:50.759
But the only problem is,
they're playing a waltz.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.429
And the only dance
this woman can do is..

16:57.015 --> 16:59.059
Well, Vince happens
to have this deep dark secret.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.227
Now, that has nothing
to do with the story.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.479
Yes, it does. It's important.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.940
His mother used to run,
"Tippy Tap Dance Studio."

17:05.022 --> 17:07.276
So he used to take turns dancing
with all the little girls

17:07.358 --> 17:08.444
in the ballroom dance classes--

17:08.527 --> 17:09.569
Th-th-th..

17:10.779 --> 17:12.321
So I teach her, a few moves.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.116
She takes a couple
little steps

17:14.199 --> 17:16.785
and Holly steps on what,
grass or cheese

17:16.868 --> 17:19.704
or whatever the hell's
on the ground in Paris.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.790
And we go crashing
into these flower beds.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.626
And when I pull her out,
her dress is torn

17:24.710 --> 17:26.545
her foot's already
turning black and blue

17:26.627 --> 17:29.214
but all I can see,
is that she's got these..

17:30.591 --> 17:31.842
...rose petals in her hair.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.013
And the whole next day whenever,
she'd shake her hair..

17:38.057 --> 17:39.141
...I'd smell those roses.

17:39.224 --> 17:40.726
[music continues]

17:42.436 --> 17:44.188
So you got drunk,
fell in a bush

17:44.271 --> 17:45.522
and then didn't shower
for a day.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.275
That's so...adorable.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.237
[instrumental music]

17:56.033 --> 17:57.367
Oh, my God. Customers.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.995
Well, how-how did this happen?
What did you do?

18:00.078 --> 18:01.079
Well, what did you do?

18:01.163 --> 18:02.539
All of those ads and flyers

18:02.623 --> 18:04.792
and cupcake baskets
must've paid off!

18:04.875 --> 18:06.168
They love them!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.419
They're here for our cupcakes?

18:07.503 --> 18:11.840
Mm-hmm. What can I say?
You were right, Val.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.677
See, Lauren,
people are basically good.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.764
Mm-hmm, and we didn't
have to use sex or sleaze

18:18.847 --> 18:21.058
or objectify the female body.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.727
You teach me every day.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.024
Okay, hot buns,
here's some more samples.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.859
And, uh, let's keep
that moneymaker shaking.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.361
We're getting
a little slow in there.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.949
God! This is amazing.

18:37.699 --> 18:38.992
Oh, thank you.

18:40.118 --> 18:41.286
Have you ever had a job

18:41.370 --> 18:44.248
where you didn't
take off your shirt?

18:44.331 --> 18:45.582
No.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.752
Hey, listen, why don't
you, grab us a table?

18:48.836 --> 18:50.587
I'm gonna get some cupcakes,
preferably ones

18:50.671 --> 18:53.048
that didn't make contact
with Gary's naked body.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.682
Where's Amber?

19:01.765 --> 19:03.183
Oh, we, uh, called it a night.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.645
Aw. So, what'd you think of her?

19:07.771 --> 19:08.730
She's okay.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.023
Maybe we should all, um

19:10.107 --> 19:11.692
hang out again some time.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.610
I don't think so.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.487
You didn't have a good time?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.906
- Just not that interested.
- Why not?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.327
Think about it, Holly.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.999
- Hey, why'd Vince leave?
- I don't know.

19:27.082 --> 19:28.458
What happened with Amber?

19:28.542 --> 19:30.586
I just don't think
he really liked her.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.588
Oh, that's funny. I thought she
would've been just his type.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.590
Yeah, I'm so glad
that we don't have to go

19:34.673 --> 19:38.677
through that anymore,
blind dates and setups.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.762
I'm really grateful
that we have each other.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.765
- Yeah, me too.
- Mm.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.186
- I love you, Holly.
- I love you, too, Vince.

19:54.610 --> 19:55.986
[theme music]
