00:41.410 --> 00:45.290
I didn't kill Clarke.

00:45.330 --> 00:46.420
Are you sure about that?

00:48.290 --> 00:50.380
We've been through this
a thousand times.

00:50.420 --> 00:51.960
I showed up. He popped out.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.760
He had all these stab wounds
all over him.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.800
You were holding the knife
that he was stabbed with.

00:56.840 --> 00:57.550
Stop talking.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.970
Clarke told the whole world at a
press conference yesterday

01:02.020 --> 01:03.520
that you were gonna kill him,
and that he was gonna

01:03.560 --> 01:06.310
press charges
against Leslie for assault.

01:06.350 --> 01:09.360
And he just happens to
end up dead? Look.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.400
This will all be over if you
just tell the truth.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.450
I am telling you the truth.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.120
Leslie Bennett is not gonna bail
you out this time, old friend.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.750
For some reason, nobody
knows where she is.

01:28.630 --> 01:28.710
Alright, look.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.710
I'm gonna want a moment,
alone with my client, please.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.720
His blood is all over you.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.550
You were holding the weapon.
You have a motive.

01:36.590 --> 01:40.180
[Walter] I want a moment
alone with my client. Now!

01:40.220 --> 01:41.810
This is murder, Jake.

01:42.390 --> 01:44.890
Murder. Okay?

01:44.930 --> 01:49.110
You're charm and jokes are not
gonna get you outta this one.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.150
I've been doing this
all night.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.780
Send Jake down to
Her Majesty's Pen.

01:57.820 --> 02:00.160
I'm sure him and his lawyer
will be very comfortable there.

02:14.800 --> 02:15.670
What the hell?

02:21.510 --> 02:23.350
[Brogan] Don't be
stupid, gentlemen.

02:23.390 --> 02:25.890
[Harley] We need dynamite or
something to blow this door.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.140
[Brogan]
Plan B, then?

02:31.310 --> 02:34.480
[Grayson] Hey! This is a
police vehicle. We will fire!

02:34.530 --> 02:36.650
[firing]

02:36.690 --> 02:37.900
[Harley]
Thant was dumb!

02:37.950 --> 02:38.740
Do it again
and you're a dead cop!

02:39.450 --> 02:40.780
This is Officer Grayson.

02:40.820 --> 02:42.950
We are requesting immediate
backup on Forest Road.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.240
We have two suspects.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.910
Gas! Gas!

02:47.960 --> 02:48.960
What the hell?

02:55.670 --> 02:58.050
Roll down your windows. Throw
out your weapons, please.

02:58.920 --> 02:59.970
Do it. Or you will burn.

03:04.350 --> 03:08.100
Very good. Now, slowly, step out
of the van, show me your hands.

03:12.770 --> 03:13.860
Keys please.

03:14.770 --> 03:15.940
Down on your knees, gentlemen.

03:19.570 --> 03:20.570
[buzzing]

03:20.610 --> 03:21.700

03:32.000 --> 03:32.880
Uncuff yourself.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.130
[Jake]
Okay.

03:36.170 --> 03:37.050
Okay.

04:11.870 --> 04:12.750
C'mon!

[Des] They think
Jake killed Clarke.

04:42.950 --> 04:43.990
That doesn't make
any sense.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.820
No. It doesn't. Don't
worry, honey.

04:45.860 --> 04:47.070
We'll get to the
bottom of it.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.700
We have everything narrowed
down to this guy-

04:48.740 --> 04:50.290
Blake Brogan.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.700
There's a reason I couldn't find
anything on him.

04:51.750 --> 04:55.250
He spent some time overseas.
Hong Kong. UAE. Monaco.

04:55.290 --> 04:56.830
What was he doing there?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.840
I don't know. It just says
independent contractor.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.090
Demolitions Specialist.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.350
Please tell me you made a
deposit at the bank today.

05:09.390 --> 05:10.680
No. Why?

05:10.720 --> 05:11.850
The safe's empty, Des.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.180
Sloan.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.440
I guess so.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.390
What are we gonna do?

05:15.440 --> 05:16.690
I don't know.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.770
Just let's keep this between
us for now, okay?

05:21.150 --> 05:22.230
[Hood] Listen, I hate
Jake as much as anyone.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.740
But I'm telling you--

05:23.780 --> 05:25.990
You don't think he killed Clarke
or arranged to jailbreak.

05:26.030 --> 05:27.280
No. I don't.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.870
For the record,
I don't hate Jake Doyle. At all.

05:30.780 --> 05:31.700
What did you see?

05:31.740 --> 05:32.870
I think I saw--

05:32.910 --> 05:34.080
I saw them drag Jake away.

05:34.870 --> 05:35.920
But I gotta say, Boss--

05:36.290 --> 05:37.500
What?

05:37.540 --> 05:39.290
It looked like he was taken
against his will.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.090
Okay. Get cleaned up.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.760
Find Jake Doyle.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.590
Get his family in here now.

05:45.010 --> 05:45.970
On it.

05:48.720 --> 05:50.350
[Luke] Jake Doyle
killed the ex-mayor.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.060
What kind of a family are
you running with?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.980
He didn't do it. I know him.

05:55.020 --> 05:57.390
Whatever. It's all good.
We're gonna be filthy rich.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.810
And you'll never have to
see him again.

06:01.060 --> 06:01.690
So we understand the plan.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.440
My plan? Yes, I do.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.360
We bring in the money and we
set up a camera in his office.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.240
You plant the camera directly
in front of the safe.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.490
We steal the cash.
Next stop, Mexico.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.000
[Brogan]
Hi.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.300
I have to say, Jake.

06:25.340 --> 06:27.630
You were not supposed
to show up when I killed Clarke.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.970
Kinda messed up my plans, pal.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.260
You killed him.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.220
Yeah, he was
running his mouth.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.140
Reopening all these nasty
accusations about kickbacks.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.520
I mean, can you believe he
called a press conference?

06:41.810 --> 06:44.610
And then he tried to shake
me down for money.

06:44.650 --> 06:45.940
You offered Clarke cash

06:47.190 --> 06:48.950
for the contract for
the airport terminal.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.450
But obviously,
Elsa paid him more.

06:51.490 --> 06:52.580
You're a smart guy, Jake.

06:53.700 --> 06:56.330
Too bad Clarke wasn't.
So he had to go.

06:56.370 --> 06:57.620
You should be thanking me.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.960
Did you drug me?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.550
Just to keep it
interesting, Jake.

07:07.630 --> 07:09.090
Alright, what do you
want from me?

07:09.130 --> 07:10.930
A lot, Jake.

07:10.970 --> 07:14.140
You are an integral part
to this plan.

07:14.180 --> 07:15.350
That's why I busted you out
of police custody.

07:16.890 --> 07:19.020
Well, if it's okay with you,
I mean I appreciate it, but

07:19.940 --> 07:21.310
I'd rather go back to prison.

07:21.350 --> 07:22.980
Because there's less
psychopaths there.

07:23.480 --> 07:24.980
[laughing]

07:25.020 --> 07:26.690
Funny. Funny guy, Jake.

07:26.730 --> 07:28.400
If you only knew what our
plans really were.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.370
It might make you take all
this a little more seriously.

07:33.820 --> 07:34.740
Listen--

07:35.200 --> 07:36.080
Brogan.

07:36.740 --> 07:37.620
Whatever.

07:40.250 --> 07:40.920
You're insane.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.000
And obviously, you're
about to implode.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.000
And don't take this personally,

07:46.420 --> 07:48.210
But I'd like to be as far away
from you as possible

07:48.260 --> 07:49.840
when that happens.

07:49.880 --> 07:52.010
So if you don't mind letting me
go, that would be great. Thanks.

07:52.050 --> 07:52.930
Arrgh!

07:56.510 --> 07:58.180
Was that really necessary?

07:58.220 --> 08:00.020
The violence only teaches
you one thing.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.940
The person you're
fighting is yourself.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.570
Alright. Harley.

08:09.610 --> 08:10.530
Nice to see you again.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.700
I see you got yourself
a new boss.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.280
You always were attracted
to the real winners.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.290
He's not my boss, Jake.

08:19.330 --> 08:20.790
Brogan is the teacher.

08:21.910 --> 08:23.580
And together we're gonna
do great things.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.250
The teacher.

08:25.290 --> 08:26.290
Why do I get the feeling

08:27.750 --> 08:30.760
you fellas are gonna hand me a
pamphlet any minute now?

08:30.800 --> 08:31.760
[Brogan]
Jake, please.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.880
Don't start to get insulting.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.260
Or I'm gonna have to hurt you
again.

08:35.300 --> 08:36.890
And I don't wanna do that, pal.

08:36.930 --> 08:40.430
It'll be easier if you joined
with us. Our mission's perfect.

08:40.470 --> 08:43.020
Teacher, mission,
join with us.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.770
[Brogan] The police
have a large amount of

08:46.810 --> 08:48.730
my explosives in their custody.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.570
And I need you to
get them back for me.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.940
Sounds like fun, huh?

08:52.990 --> 08:54.700
[Jake] Please don't take
this as insulting.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.320
I think you're
a little too unstable

08:57.370 --> 08:59.160
to handle that
kind of firepower.

08:59.200 --> 09:00.910
You might change
your mind about that.

09:00.950 --> 09:02.000
No, I won't.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.290
When I'll tell you about
your girlfriend.

09:04.330 --> 09:05.210
Leslie.

09:06.460 --> 09:08.540
When was the last time
you heard from her?

09:13.380 --> 09:15.090
What did you say?

09:15.130 --> 09:18.430
If you don't do everything
that I tell you to do,

09:18.470 --> 09:20.640
you'll never hear
from Leslie again.

09:21.850 --> 09:23.060
Well now.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.060
All of a sudden.

09:31.940 --> 09:33.360
Where is she? What
did you do to her?

09:33.400 --> 09:36.360
I'll tell you. But first,
go get the explosives.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.200
Then, I'll give you
Leslie Bennet. Simple.

09:39.410 --> 09:40.580
[Harley] The explosives
are being moved

09:40.620 --> 09:41.620
to a disposal facility.

09:42.740 --> 09:44.370
I'll text you the time
and location.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.420
Call us when you have them.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.710
And Jake, keep your head down.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.710
The cops are kind of
on the lookout for you.

09:50.750 --> 09:54.210
And if you get caught, I'm
gonna have to cut my losses.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.800
I'm gonna kill you.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.180
Let's hope for Leslie Bennet's
sake, you're not that stupid.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.810
Harley will drop you somewhere
away from here.

10:03.260 --> 10:06.390
Good luck. You're gonna need
it to save Leslie's life.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.190
Bye now.

10:15.110 --> 10:15.700
-Anything?
-No.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.070
All I know is that he escaped,

10:18.110 --> 10:19.240
and they're looking for him
everywhere.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.530
And I can't find Sloan.
Any luck?

10:21.570 --> 10:23.990
Not yet. I even sent a squad car
out looking for her.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
She's vanished.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.410
Whoever has Jake
might have her too.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.370
Possibly, yeah.

10:27.410 --> 10:28.750
Constable.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.880
You realize your being here
is the very definition

10:30.920 --> 10:31.920
of a conflict of interest?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.210
Honestly, Inspector,

10:33.250 --> 10:35.300
I found out about all this
long after you did.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.470
We'll talk about that later.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.550
Any of you heard form Jake?

10:39.590 --> 10:41.720
We know that Jake had
nothing to do with this.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.560
Apologies, Rose,
but that was not my question.

10:43.600 --> 10:44.680
He hasn't make contact.

10:44.720 --> 10:45.770
I swear.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.020
[Mal] None of us has
heard from him.

10:47.060 --> 10:50.150
Which, as his father,
makes me very uneasy.

10:50.190 --> 10:50.650
It's making the rest of us
uneasy too.

10:52.020 --> 10:54.320
If any of you hear from him,
please let me know.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.110
Right away.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.400
[ringing]

10:56.440 --> 11:00.410
I'm sorry that's J--
My girlfriend. Just a sec.

11:01.570 --> 11:03.740
-Hey baby. What's up?
-[Jake] What?

11:03.780 --> 11:05.910
Des. Listen to me.
This is very important.

11:05.950 --> 11:07.910
I love you too, baby.

11:07.950 --> 11:11.370
You're so hot when
you're in that shower.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.710
I really hope you're talking
to me like this because

11:13.750 --> 11:14.840
you're in front of the cops,

11:14.880 --> 11:15.920
and not because
you've lost your mind.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.010
That's right, baby. Yeah.

11:18.720 --> 11:18.760
Whatever, Des. Listen.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.890
Grab Dad.
I'm gonna text you an address.

11:21.930 --> 11:23.890
Take the surveillance
van to pick me up.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.010
Do you understand?

11:25.060 --> 11:26.600
Oh, I love you too.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.400
Alright. Well, remember
what I said. I'll be in touch.

11:35.940 --> 11:38.030
Obviously, I don't have another
girlfriend, besides you.

11:38.070 --> 11:40.320
Which we've made public--

11:40.900 --> 11:41.820
Is Jake okay?

11:41.860 --> 11:42.700
Where is he?

11:42.740 --> 11:44.160
He wants us to meet him.

11:44.200 --> 11:48.750
Tinny. We have to help Jake.
If you have any hesitation

11:48.790 --> 11:50.120
you need to
follow through on it.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.750
No one will judge you.
Not Jake, me, or any of us.

11:52.790 --> 11:53.920
He's right, honey.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.550
Go. Find him.

12:02.300 --> 12:04.260
[Jake] Someone tell me
they know where Sloan is.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.640
No one can find her.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.760
If Brogan hurt her--

12:07.810 --> 12:10.600
No. He'd have no reason to.
He only needs Leslie.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.140
Let's sort one mess out
at a time, okay?

12:13.190 --> 12:15.480
You escaped from police
custody. What's going on?

12:15.520 --> 12:16.860
Brogan.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.070
He's got Leslie held
captive. And he killed Clarke.

12:19.110 --> 12:21.190
He's gonna do the exact
same thing to her

12:21.240 --> 12:23.610
if we don't break into the
Police Disposal Facility

12:23.660 --> 12:25.200
and steal a load of explosives.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.450
What does he want with
the explosives?

12:26.490 --> 12:27.530
God only knows.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.040
I'm pretty sure he knows
how to use them.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.160
He was a demolition expert
overseas. Jake, he is dangerous.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.790
Des. I need you to find out
where they're keeping Leslie.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.330
Right. They?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.500
Harley's working for Brogan now.

12:38.550 --> 12:40.090
It's pretty obvious
what we gotta do.

12:40.130 --> 12:41.010
Right.

12:43.090 --> 12:44.090
What?

12:44.130 --> 12:45.180
Steal from the cops.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.350
That must be the shipment.

12:54.730 --> 12:55.480
Barbed wire fence.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.520
Reinforced gate.
And four guards.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.070
Armed.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.530
This is not gonna be easy.

13:01.570 --> 13:03.900
It's way more men than
I was anticipating.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.570
Look.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.870
Dad, I'm already wanted
by the cops.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.660
I got no idea how I'm gonna
get out of this mess.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.790
So why don't I just go do this
by myself, alright?

13:12.830 --> 13:15.160
One of us, you, will
have to climb the gate.

13:15.210 --> 13:18.210
While one of us, me,
runs a little interference.

13:18.250 --> 13:21.300
As much as I'd like to go scale
a barbed wire fence right now,

13:21.340 --> 13:22.050
I don't think we
got enough time.

13:22.090 --> 13:23.510
You have a better plan

13:23.550 --> 13:25.760
other than walking over there
and asking them for it?

13:27.890 --> 13:28.640
That's a...

13:30.060 --> 13:33.890
That's a pretty good idea.
It's nice. It's simple.

13:33.930 --> 13:35.230
You can't be serious.

13:35.270 --> 13:36.640
Get out of the car.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.360
And make a break for it as
something opens up.

13:38.400 --> 13:38.980
Opens up?

13:39.650 --> 13:41.280
Ge out of the car.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.460
We've been cleaned out.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.100
[tires screech]

14:13.520 --> 14:14.980
Hey guys.
My name's Jake Doyle.

14:15.020 --> 14:15.810
I'm wanted for murder.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.690
Who wants to be a hero?

14:32.950 --> 14:35.200
The bank tracked the
account holder to this guy.

14:35.250 --> 14:35.500
It's Luke Jacobs.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.670
The idiot didn't even us
a dummy name.

14:38.710 --> 14:40.830
Anyway, he stole all our money,

14:40.880 --> 14:42.750
and he left a trail
like a caterpillar.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.380
Luckily,
the bank recognizes it's fraud

14:44.420 --> 14:46.340
and I think the
money's gonna be insured.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.130
What happened?

14:48.170 --> 14:49.090
Brogan has Leslie
held hostage.

14:49.130 --> 14:49.930
Oh my God!

14:49.970 --> 14:51.390
Yeah. So we gotta find her.

14:51.430 --> 14:53.760
Okay, so, I tracked down
the three current listings that

14:53.800 --> 14:54.600
Brogan has access to through his
business corporation, right?

14:56.140 --> 14:57.890
So there's a parking garage.
There's a restaurant, and--

14:58.850 --> 15:00.150
[Rose]
The airport expansion.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.230
You think he's
holding her there?

15:01.270 --> 15:02.230
No, it's unlikely.

15:02.270 --> 15:03.770
Because now
all work is on hold

15:03.810 --> 15:05.360
while they sort through the
scandal between Elsa and Clarke.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.610
What else?

15:06.650 --> 15:07.650
Well, Brogan has some
residential property,

15:08.820 --> 15:09.200
but I looked into him and
I found nothing.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.570
Elsa's our link to Brogan.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.700
Maybe we should go talk to her,
see if she can give us anything.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.740
I'm having a lot of trouble
tracking Elsa right now.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.040
She's not at home,
and even if she was,

15:18.080 --> 15:19.660
there's no way she's
gonna talk to us.

15:19.710 --> 15:20.960
What are you getting at?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.830
I know Tinny's walking
a fine line right now,

15:22.880 --> 15:25.420
but we could really use
her help on this one.

15:25.880 --> 15:26.760
Call her.

15:28.420 --> 15:29.340
Jake?

15:29.380 --> 15:30.720
Yeah. You got the explosives?

15:30.760 --> 15:31.260
No.

15:31.300 --> 15:32.840
And next time,

15:32.890 --> 15:35.640
you tell me the full plan before
you pull something like that.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.730
Look. I gotta lose this car and
get another one. So, hurry up.

15:39.770 --> 15:41.020
Hurry up?

15:41.060 --> 15:43.810
Just get in there and get
the explosives, alright?

15:58.700 --> 16:01.460
Good. Now, getting outta here.

16:27.690 --> 16:29.650
[ringing]

16:33.280 --> 16:34.280
Yeah.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.570
You have dynamite.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.740
I'm impressed.

16:36.780 --> 16:37.990
How do you know that?

16:38.030 --> 16:39.580
I know a lot of things, Jake.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.080
Just bring me the explosives.

16:42.120 --> 16:44.040
I will. I just got like

16:44.080 --> 16:46.290
a gazillion angry
security guards all over me.

16:46.330 --> 16:49.800
As soon as I get rid of them,
the explosives are all yours.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.800
Well, you know what's at stake.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.300
So I'll be very careful with
your next move.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.550
Tell you what. Just

16:54.590 --> 16:56.350
text me your address
and I'll bring it to you.

16:57.390 --> 16:59.010
That's a nice try.
Just get it done

16:59.060 --> 17:01.100
and I'll be in touch with
what happens next.

17:01.140 --> 17:04.650
I'm sure Leslie's very curious
about what's to come.

17:08.520 --> 17:12.110
Des. Shut up. Listen. I need
you to hack into my phone

17:12.150 --> 17:15.950
and track the last number that
just called me. Got it? Bye.

17:21.660 --> 17:23.250
Yes boy.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.260
This has gotta be the easiest
car that I ever stole.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.900
I could swear I told someone
to send you home.

17:49.940 --> 17:50.770
Why?

17:50.820 --> 17:51.940
Tinny.

17:51.980 --> 17:53.400
You're a good cop.
Everybody knows that.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.740
But your family's involved
in this. You're uncle.

17:55.780 --> 17:58.570
You can't be impartial.
It's impossible.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.030
I realize that.
But hear me out?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.580
What?

18:02.620 --> 18:04.950
I know everyone here thinks Jake
is guilty, and I'm not gonna

18:05.000 --> 18:05.410
try and convince you otherwise.

18:06.790 --> 18:08.710
But I'd be remiss if I didn't
mention something.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.170
Elsa Tessier admitted
to bribing Clarke

18:12.210 --> 18:13.550
to get the airport contract.

18:13.590 --> 18:14.920
We already know this,
Constable.

18:14.970 --> 18:16.090
I know.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.130
But she mentioned
in her statement to us,

18:18.180 --> 18:19.720
that there was someone
else involved

18:19.760 --> 18:21.600
who she was selling
the explosives to.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.100
But she didn't reveal
the name.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.020
I think we need to
dig further.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.270
It wouldn't hurt to
bring her in.

18:26.310 --> 18:26.350
Talk to her.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.020
She's staying at her summer
home out in Salmonier Line.

18:31.060 --> 18:33.070
Okay. Bring her in.

18:51.710 --> 18:52.630
[Mal]
Let's go.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.550
That's quite the arsenal.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.760
Are we really gonna hand them
over to this madman?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.260
I don't know. But
Brogan's watching us.

18:59.300 --> 19:00.840
He knows we've
got the dynamite.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.100
I've gotta convince him I'm
gonna do whatever he wants

19:03.140 --> 19:04.140
long enough to find Leslie.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.060
[ringing]

19:07.480 --> 19:08.980
Des. What do you got?

19:09.020 --> 19:10.770
I tracked the phone. And I'm
pretty sure I got a location.

19:10.810 --> 19:11.940
Where?

19:11.980 --> 19:13.110
The phone that Brogan
called you from

19:13.150 --> 19:14.610
is somewhere near Elsa's house.

19:14.650 --> 19:15.980
[Rose] Also, we checked the
deed to Elsa's property.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.610
Turns out she sold it to a
numbered company

19:18.650 --> 19:19.990
three months ago.

19:20.030 --> 19:22.490
Guess who the sole
shareholder of the company is?

19:22.530 --> 19:24.160
Brogan bought Elsa's house.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.370
She must have needed the cash.

19:25.410 --> 19:26.870
That's gotta be where he's
keeping Leslie.

19:26.910 --> 19:28.250
[car revs]

19:28.660 --> 19:29.040
Easy.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.500
We're not carrying groceries
back there.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.960
[tires squeal]

19:49.940 --> 19:50.980
No Leslie.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.150
[Jake]
I was here before.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.230
The concrete floor.
The hook on the light.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.440
Brogan's chair.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.280
What are you talking about?

20:00.070 --> 20:01.700
He was holding me here.

20:01.740 --> 20:05.070
I'm telling you.
I mean, I was drugged.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.040
I dunno, Dad. I feel like I'm
losing my mind here.

20:07.910 --> 20:09.750
[Brogan] Jake! Out here!

20:13.630 --> 20:16.040
Jake! Well done.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.380
You're resourceful.
I'll give you that.

20:18.420 --> 20:19.590
Malachy.

20:19.630 --> 20:21.170
They're in the trunk.
They've got 'em.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.640
See, I knew you were the right
guy for the job, pal.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.720
Where is she?

20:26.180 --> 20:27.680
Leslie? She's close.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.230
She doesn't have much
time left, Jake.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.960
Now remember exactly
what I say when I say it

20:56.000 --> 20:57.040
or you'll never see
Leslie alive again.

20:58.420 --> 21:02.170
Okay. You want me to blow up
hundreds of people.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.300
[Harley]
Relax, Jake.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.470
Listen to the teacher.
He has a vision.

21:05.510 --> 21:06.640
[Mal]
This is crazy.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.810
You can't expect us to go
along with this.

21:21.650 --> 21:23.700
-[buzz]
-Arrgh!

21:25.240 --> 21:27.620
[Brogan]
Gentlemen. Gentlemen! Please.

21:27.660 --> 21:29.240
Take comfort in the fact

21:29.280 --> 21:32.080
that what you are doing will
liberate the minds of many.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.540
Yes. I know you worry
about Leslie.

21:35.580 --> 21:36.120
-[buzz]
-Arrgh!

21:36.170 --> 21:37.710
Stop it!

21:37.750 --> 21:40.300
Until he learns that the teacher
is always right, he will pay.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.510
-[buzz]
-Arrgh!

21:50.510 --> 21:51.720
[Mal]
Leave him alone.

21:51.760 --> 21:55.520
Now, now, father.
Don't move. Or I finish him.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.230
You're a dead man.
I promise you that.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.730
We're all dead men, Jake.

22:02.780 --> 22:07.070
Do it. Do it!
Or let Leslie go.

22:07.110 --> 22:08.360
She has enough air in the tank

22:08.410 --> 22:10.160
to survive a little
while longer.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.530
Don't worry.

22:11.580 --> 22:15.210
We'll get her to safety once
we complete the mission.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.250
Malachy.

22:16.290 --> 22:17.870
You're free to go as
I don't need you

22:17.920 --> 22:19.500
to incentivize your son.

22:19.540 --> 22:20.460
I'm not leaving him.

22:20.500 --> 22:21.420
Afraid so.

22:22.630 --> 22:25.380
If the police or anyone hear
about this,

22:25.420 --> 22:26.840
When you find Leslie,

22:26.880 --> 22:29.220
she'll be long past
her expiry date.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.100
I got this. I got it.

22:34.140 --> 22:38.310
We're always watching,
Mr. Doyle. Don't forget that.

22:38.350 --> 22:39.150
Goodbye.

22:39.730 --> 22:41.150
I'll be okay.

22:45.070 --> 22:45.990
[Brogan]
Now Jake.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.360
Let's go meet our destiny.

22:50.490 --> 22:51.780
[Des] I got here as
soon as I could.

22:52.410 --> 22:53.410
[Mal] Des.

22:53.450 --> 22:54.580
They've buried Leslie somewhere.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.750
She's in a crate.
But I'm sure I saw

22:58.790 --> 23:00.830
some dirt trickle down on the
feed Brogan showed us.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.210
That could be anywhere.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.000
We know that Brogan's been
working multiple sites.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.510
The airport alone is massive.

23:05.550 --> 23:05.710
[ringing]

23:07.170 --> 23:08.970
What do you got? Please tell
me you got something.

23:09.010 --> 23:10.180
Maybe. But nothing definitive.

23:10.220 --> 23:11.340
What?

23:11.390 --> 23:11.850
I'm going through these
blueprints, okay.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.310
Brogan and Elsa have
different sets of plans.

23:15.350 --> 23:17.140
Elsa's are really
straightforward. Simple.

23:17.180 --> 23:18.640
Everything about the
site adds up.

23:18.690 --> 23:19.600
And Brogan's?

23:19.640 --> 23:20.560
They're off somehow.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.980
What do you mean, off?

23:22.020 --> 23:23.190
There's a discrepancy with the
measurements.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.190
It could be nothing, but--

23:25.230 --> 23:27.570
No. It's a lead. Send
both copies to Des.

23:27.610 --> 23:28.530
We'll check it out.

23:28.570 --> 23:29.530
Here they come.

23:29.570 --> 23:30.410
I'll keep you posted.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.820
Got sound?

23:31.870 --> 23:32.780
You know it.

23:32.820 --> 23:33.780
[Jake] No gun?

23:33.820 --> 23:35.410
Leslie buried is
quite enough.

23:35.450 --> 23:38.500
So what's Brogan. Sorry, the
Teacher. What's his big plan?

23:38.540 --> 23:40.000
Let's just say this TNT

23:40.040 --> 23:42.210
will do wonders for the main
terminal of the airport.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.540
Also, every minute you waste
is a minute of Leslie's life.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.880
The main airport terminal.

23:46.920 --> 23:47.130
What do we do?

23:48.300 --> 23:51.010
We call the cops.
We risk Leslie's life.

23:51.050 --> 23:54.470
Let's check this terminal. I'll
have to let Jake handle Harley.

23:54.510 --> 23:56.060
I know he'll have a plan.
Come on.

24:15.740 --> 24:18.950
[screaming] Somebody
help me, please!

24:20.870 --> 24:23.330
[choked up]
Somebody help me.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.210
[Mal] Des?

24:28.630 --> 24:29.510
Wait.

24:30.800 --> 24:31.880
We need to keep looking--

24:31.930 --> 24:32.840
Wait!

24:32.880 --> 24:33.890
Just wait, wait, wait.

24:34.550 --> 24:37.640
Wait a minute.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.100
Look. Elsa's plans.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.930
Rose was right. In Elsa's
plans. The blueprints.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.270
This corridor ends at
this wall here.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.110
-Okay?
-Yeah.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.360
But in Brogan's plans,

24:48.400 --> 24:51.740
the corridor keeps going for
another nine feet.

24:51.780 --> 24:53.990
[Mal] Either that's a huge
oversight by the architect--

24:54.030 --> 24:55.070
Or...

24:56.950 --> 24:58.830
Des. Give me a hand.

25:04.750 --> 25:06.080
You think she's in here?

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
Leslie?

25:15.640 --> 25:16.430
Leslie!

25:17.050 --> 25:17.720
What can you see?

25:18.760 --> 25:21.350
Nothing. Just
an empty corridor.

25:29.940 --> 25:31.440
Make yourself at home. Please.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.410
I told you, those eyes will
get you no mercy from me.

25:36.240 --> 25:37.160
[Sloan]
There.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.120
You should count it.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.120
I wouldn't trust me.

25:40.240 --> 25:42.330
The interest is included,
I presume.

25:42.370 --> 25:44.790
Of course. How else do you
make a living?

25:44.830 --> 25:49.040
I mean, no offense to this fine
detailing business of yours.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.010
None taken. Twenty grand?
It better be twenty.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.800
Oh.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.390
Before I forget.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.220
A token of
our appreciation.

26:04.270 --> 26:05.680
How did you know?

26:05.730 --> 26:07.770
Come on, Saul. Everyone knows
you love Frank.

26:07.810 --> 26:10.150
It's an original.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.230
It was my aunt's.

26:14.490 --> 26:15.570
Signed an everything.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.910
[Saul]
I'll be damned.

26:17.950 --> 26:19.870
You got guts.
I'll give you that.

26:19.910 --> 26:24.120
Well, out of respect to you.
Thank you.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.370
You're welcome.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.750
Well, if it's okay. We'll be
on our way now.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.670
Sure, kid.

26:35.130 --> 26:36.010
Good luck.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.360
You know this is
insane, right?

26:58.400 --> 27:01.070
Just shut it. And try not to
draw attention to yourself.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.830
Remember what will be gained.

27:02.870 --> 27:04.950
So Brogan is your
big cult leader.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.410
Honestly, Harley. I'm not
buying any of that.

27:08.830 --> 27:11.500
No. We're not a cult.

27:11.540 --> 27:13.170
But we needed you to
believe that we were.

27:13.210 --> 27:15.090
We needed you here. Now.

27:15.130 --> 27:16.840
So if you're not terrorists,
then why do you want me

27:16.880 --> 27:17.920
to blow up the friggin' airport?

27:18.840 --> 27:21.050
Jake Doyle kills the ex-mayor.

27:21.090 --> 27:23.300
Jake Doyle then kills his
lover Leslie Bennett.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.760
Jake Doyle goes crazy

27:24.810 --> 27:27.230
and tries to blow up St. John's
International Airport.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.520
Oh my God!

27:29.560 --> 27:31.400
He has a bomb!

27:31.440 --> 27:32.360
No, I don't!

27:32.400 --> 27:33.360
I do not!

27:33.400 --> 27:34.320
Have fun in prison, baby.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.270
Help!

27:35.320 --> 27:37.440
He's gonna kill everyone!

27:40.450 --> 27:41.950
I gotta take this!

27:54.460 --> 27:54.670
You wanted to see me?

27:56.090 --> 27:58.130
Would you like to request your
counsel be present?

27:58.170 --> 27:59.220
Why?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.430
I'm awaiting trial for
bribery charges.

28:01.470 --> 28:03.890
And theft from your
own company.

28:03.930 --> 28:06.260
Explosives that you had your
husband Curtis steal for you.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.310
Yes. I was desperate.

28:08.350 --> 28:09.640
I needed the cash.
You already know this.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.230
It was in my statement.

28:11.270 --> 28:13.940
Well, things have changed. The
explosives that were confiscated

28:13.980 --> 28:15.610
from your site were stolen from
a private disposal company.

28:17.230 --> 28:18.940
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

28:18.990 --> 28:19.440
No.

28:19.490 --> 28:20.860
Why?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.740
Because you mentioned
that you had a buyer for them.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.870
Who's the buyer?

28:24.910 --> 28:26.780
Like I said before, I'm not
gonna tell you.

28:26.830 --> 28:27.790
Well, you should
think about that.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.450
Your husband and Clarke are both
dead

28:30.500 --> 28:30.870
and we're missing an officer.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.880
Plenty of obstruction charges
to go around.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.580
You read me?

28:35.630 --> 28:38.250
Jake was just spotted out at the
airport. He has the stolen TNT.

28:39.170 --> 28:40.880
Plus, witnesses are reporting

28:40.920 --> 28:42.630
that he's threatening to blow
up the airport.

28:53.190 --> 28:55.310
Brogan was never intending to
blow up the airport.

28:55.350 --> 28:57.440
He just wanted to make it look
like I was going to.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.270
[Mal]
Yeah. And we think we know why.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.820
So, the entire airport is shut
down now, right?

29:01.860 --> 29:03.650
[Mal] Brogan's got a corridor
running from the expansion site

29:03.700 --> 29:05.240
to the Customs Office.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.570
And it wasn't in the original
floor plan, so he was doing this

29:07.620 --> 29:08.620
without anybody
knowing about it.

29:08.660 --> 29:09.370
Why?

29:09.410 --> 29:10.410
I don't know.
But...

29:10.450 --> 29:11.950
I think we should go
to the police.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.460
We can't go to the police, Des.
They think I'm a murderer.

29:14.670 --> 29:17.040
I escaped police custody.
I kidnapped a cop

29:17.080 --> 29:18.340
and now they
think I'm a terrorist.

29:18.380 --> 29:20.050
[Mal] Brogan's completely
discredited you.

29:20.090 --> 29:22.210
No one will ever believe
our word over his.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.130
You're right. You look
bat poop crazy.

29:24.170 --> 29:26.510
I don't care. We
gotta get Leslie back.

29:26.550 --> 29:27.760
You go within a hundred feet of
that airport,

29:28.720 --> 29:29.890
and they'll arrest you on site.

29:29.930 --> 29:33.140
Why would Brogan want the
airport shut down?

29:33.180 --> 29:34.440
And why would he build
this tunnel?

29:35.560 --> 29:36.650
It's gotta have

29:36.690 --> 29:38.730
something to do with smuggling
something

29:38.770 --> 29:40.110
out of this Customs Office.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.900
This is why Brogan wanted
the contract so bad

29:41.940 --> 29:44.280
and then why he went to work for
Elsa when he didn't get it.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.530
Des, check into what could be
held in Customs right now

29:46.570 --> 29:48.410
that Brogan would want to
slip out through that tunnel.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.700
We gotta find Brogan

29:49.740 --> 29:52.040
before he gets whatever it is
he's looking for.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.870
Or Leslie might
not make it out alive.

29:53.910 --> 29:55.290
[message sound]

29:59.290 --> 30:04.010
Okay. So I'm left to drive a
stolen cab by myself.

30:04.050 --> 30:05.630
Actually, that's
pretty awesome.

30:18.480 --> 30:19.360
Thank God.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.380
[whispering]
Please work.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.380
Jake. I need you, Jake.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.390
[bang]

31:02.110 --> 31:02.980
[bang]

31:04.190 --> 31:04.860
[bang]

31:05.610 --> 31:06.490
[Des] Platinum?

31:06.530 --> 31:08.070
Plane landed
at noon today

31:08.110 --> 31:10.280
carrying a shipment of platinum
bars from the National Mint.

31:10.320 --> 31:11.820
Passing through from
the United States

31:11.870 --> 31:13.200
to a private buyer in Monaco.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.250
Valued at over eighty million.

31:15.660 --> 31:16.870
Rose.

31:16.910 --> 31:18.210
Brogan used to
work in Monaco.

31:18.250 --> 31:19.670
Maybe he had an inside
track on this.

31:19.710 --> 31:21.750
I think we found
what Brogan was after.

31:21.790 --> 31:24.550
The airport's closed. Everyone's
looking for a bomber--Jake.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.170
All the planes have been
grounded all day.

31:27.210 --> 31:28.880
The plane was supposed to
leave in two hours.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.800
With this delay, Brogan can
get at least another ten hours

31:31.840 --> 31:33.260
to steal the platinum,

31:33.300 --> 31:35.390
escape through the Customs
terminal totally unnoticed.

31:35.430 --> 31:38.520
And the cops’ eyes are on
everything outside the airport.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.440
Not on the planes sitting
on the tarmac.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.280
Every five minutes.

31:50.570 --> 31:51.820
And the back side of
the airport.

31:53.120 --> 31:54.620
They don't seem to be
covering that as well.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.790
That's because the only way
into the main terminal

31:56.830 --> 31:57.660
is through customs back here.

31:58.620 --> 31:59.960
Unless you use
Brogan's tunnel.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.380
[ringing]

32:03.420 --> 32:04.380
Honey?

32:04.420 --> 32:05.960
Hey, listen.
Des is texting Jake

32:06.000 --> 32:08.840
the plane ID along with the
cargo we think Brogan is after.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.090
What are we looking at?

32:10.130 --> 32:11.470
Eighty million U.S.

32:11.510 --> 32:12.050
National Mint platinum.

32:13.180 --> 32:15.010
We'll keep you posted
on what happens.

32:15.800 --> 32:16.470
We gotta get inside.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.180
We have to make sure Brogan is
in there.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.350
And we need to catch
him with it.

32:21.390 --> 32:23.400
Then use it as leverage to get
Leslie back. It's the only way.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.020
I can't believe that
the two people

32:26.060 --> 32:27.900
that I likely care about
most in the world--

32:27.940 --> 32:30.240
One of them I can't get a hold
of. And the other one's missing.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.450
Hey.

32:31.490 --> 32:34.660
Leslie and Sloan are okay.
We can do this.

32:35.530 --> 32:36.410
Head's up.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.000
[whispering]
That's them.

32:53.800 --> 32:54.680
Let's go.

33:11.190 --> 33:12.240
Someone's on to us.

33:12.280 --> 33:13.200
We gotta get outta here.

33:13.240 --> 33:15.200
No, no, no. It's
just the Doyles.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.410
They thought this is where
we had the cop stashed.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.160
I've been watching on CC.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.120
Harley. Let's just
finish this job.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.960
Plane's right on the other
side of this hallway.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.630
We walk out. We get the
platinum. We're gone.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.420
There's two guards
watching the plane.

33:34.050 --> 33:35.380
The tightness and

33:35.430 --> 33:38.050
safety of airport security
is gonna make them lax.

33:38.970 --> 33:40.470
Get in close. Take them out.

33:41.140 --> 33:42.390
What if I mess up?

33:42.430 --> 33:44.100
Then it will get messy.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.190
Shall we?

33:50.940 --> 33:51.820
Ready?

34:02.620 --> 34:03.500
[Brogan]
There it is.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.000
Just as planned.

34:15.800 --> 34:18.140
Hey boys. See any
Jihadist's tonight?

34:18.180 --> 34:19.970
Not much chance of that,
I'd say.

34:20.010 --> 34:21.220
What a waste of time this is.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.350
Some wacko faked a bomb threat
is what I heard.

34:23.390 --> 34:24.470
Hey lads.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.640
What's this on the side
of your plane?

34:25.680 --> 34:26.350
What?

34:26.770 --> 34:27.810
[buzz]

34:28.270 --> 34:29.150
[buzz]

34:42.200 --> 34:43.080
[buzz]

34:59.550 --> 35:00.600
Harley!

35:03.430 --> 35:04.890
Harley!
Let's go!

35:15.110 --> 35:16.490
Put that one on the bottom.

35:28.540 --> 35:29.960
Eighty million.

35:31.370 --> 35:33.130
Now, let's get
the hell out here.

35:45.640 --> 35:47.140
[Jake] I think it's
time that we have

35:47.180 --> 35:50.730
a really, really deep chat.

35:51.690 --> 35:52.770
Don't you?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.400
[Jake]
So, Harley, tell me.

36:00.450 --> 36:04.070
What's the big lesson from the
Teacher in this one, huh?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.580
[Brogan]
Jake.

36:05.620 --> 36:07.580
Let's not go taking
this all personally now.

36:07.620 --> 36:08.540
Personally?

36:09.330 --> 36:11.710
Where's Leslie?

36:12.580 --> 36:13.920
I'll tell you, alright?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.970
[Mal] Jake! I got
this! Go. Go!

36:19.880 --> 36:21.760
Down on the ground. No one move!

36:21.800 --> 36:22.840
Drop the gun. Now!

36:23.930 --> 36:26.010
We're on your side.
Take it easy.

36:26.060 --> 36:26.970
You drop it.

36:27.010 --> 36:28.350
Now we both know
mine's bigger.

36:28.390 --> 36:29.520
So you drop yours.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.480
Then you get to keep
your platinum.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.810
And we could both send this
one to jail. Okay?

36:38.690 --> 36:40.360
Okay.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.870
Now that we trust each other--

36:45.910 --> 36:47.830
I need you to cover me. Deal?

36:48.240 --> 36:49.450
Deal.

-Screw you.

37:15.650 --> 37:16.810
Ha, ha! I'm not gonna
tell you, Jake.

37:17.650 --> 37:18.730
Nobody knows where she is.

37:19.150 --> 37:20.230
Only me.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.690
Even Harley doesn't
know where she is.

Feel good, Jake?

[snap-staple gun sound]

37:34.750 --> 37:36.580
-What did--

37:41.340 --> 37:42.340
Ohhh!

37:42.380 --> 37:43.510
Where is she?

37:43.550 --> 37:45.470
No, no. I can't tell you.

37:45.510 --> 37:45.970
[screaming]
Where is she?

37:46.720 --> 37:48.600
You can't kill me, Jake.

37:50.390 --> 37:51.850
Tell me.

37:51.890 --> 37:52.680
[snap]

37:53.730 --> 37:56.730
Or this will get very,
very ugly.

37:57.940 --> 37:59.310
You wanna see her?

37:59.360 --> 38:00.230
One last time?

38:13.620 --> 38:14.750
She's alive.

38:15.870 --> 38:17.870
I even give her a
proper burial, Jake.

38:17.920 --> 38:21.050
She's at peace. I gave her
own headstones and everything.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.260
Son! Don't!

38:23.300 --> 38:23.960
I got a call from Tinny.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.340
Leslie's buried at Elsa's.

38:26.380 --> 38:27.930
That's a big place, Jake.

38:29.220 --> 38:31.930
And her oxygen tank ran out
five minutes ago.

[Luke] We gotta hurry.

39:47.920 --> 39:48.800
Relax.

39:51.300 --> 39:51.840
Here.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.260
Are you sure this is
gonna work?

39:55.350 --> 39:57.680
I told you. I'm good
with numbers.

39:59.560 --> 40:01.310
[Luke] Where did you get
that photo, anyway?

40:01.350 --> 40:02.980

It's not important.

40:04.230 --> 40:05.570
[Luke]
Ready?

40:05.610 --> 40:07.570
Here we go.

Yup.

Alright. Twenty seven.

And fourteen right.
