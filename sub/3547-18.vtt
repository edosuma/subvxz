00:00.083 --> 00:02.166
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.250 --> 00:04.041
<i>Mike's therapy hit a snag.</i>

00:04.125 --> 00:05.709
I keep telling you, I don't remember.

00:05.792 --> 00:08.041
Something happened at that movie.
Who did you see it with?

00:08.125 --> 00:10.125
- Probably Susan.
- Why not ask her about it?

00:10.208 --> 00:12.875
- Mike, it wasn't a movie. That was us.
- What?

00:12.959 --> 00:14.834
That was the first night
that we spent together.

00:14.917 --> 00:18.291
I saw you watching us.
We were just talking.

00:18.375 --> 00:20.583
<i>Gabby saw another side of Victor.</i>

00:20.667 --> 00:22.667
I didn't marry an angry woman.
I just divorced one.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.917
And I set her up in a nice house,
I gave her an allowance.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.458
And then I came and went as I pleased.

00:26.542 --> 00:27.959
I've known you for two weeks,

00:28.041 --> 00:30.750
and this is the first glimpse of a guy
I could actually like.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.291
<i>Tom's back put him out of commission.</i>

00:33.375 --> 00:35.125
It'll be a while
before he's back on his feet.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.792
- How much of a while?
- Three months.

00:36.875 --> 00:40.083
<i>And Edie bared more than her soul</i>
<i>for Carlos.</i>

00:40.166 --> 00:42.875
I'm here and I'm asking for a chance.

00:48.291 --> 00:52.917
<i>Edie Britt had always thought</i>
<i>of herself as passionate.</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:55.041
<i>Aggressively,</i>

00:55.125 --> 00:57.166
<i>relentlessly,</i>

00:57.250 --> 00:59.375
<i>violently passionate.</i>

01:01.208 --> 01:05.542
<i>Carlos Solis had always thought</i>
<i>of himself as passionate.</i>

01:05.625 --> 01:07.709
<i>Romantically,</i>

01:07.792 --> 01:10.333
<i>spontaneously,</i>

01:10.417 --> 01:13.542
<i>constantly passionate.</i>

01:13.625 --> 01:19.125
<i>So it was natural for Edie and Carlos</i>
<i>to assume that if they ever had sex,</i>

01:19.208 --> 01:21.041
<i>it would be amazing.</i>

01:21.125 --> 01:24.750
<i>And in fact, it was.</i>

01:24.834 --> 01:28.291
<i>Amazingly bad.</i>

01:28.375 --> 01:30.625
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.417
So last night...

01:34.500 --> 01:38.000
Yeah, I know. Wow.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.542
Super wow.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.250
Is that clock right?

01:47.333 --> 01:48.917
Oh, man, I gotta get to work.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.542
Yeah. I gotta get home.

01:52.834 --> 01:56.166
So... Well, we should do this again.

01:56.250 --> 02:00.792
Oh, definitely. This week
doesn't seem to be that great. Maybe...

02:00.875 --> 02:02.625
Next week, I'm swamped.

02:02.709 --> 02:06.291
Oh. Well, we'll figure something out.

02:06.375 --> 02:12.083
<i>It was at that moment Edie and Carlos</i>
<i>had the exact same thought.</i>

02:14.667 --> 02:15.792
Thank you.

02:15.875 --> 02:19.291
No. Thank you.

02:19.375 --> 02:23.125
<i>They would definitely</i>
<i>be having sex again.</i>

02:23.625 --> 02:27.041
<i>Just not with each other.</i>

03:10.625 --> 03:15.000
<i>It's so easy to spot the lonely ones.</i>

03:15.083 --> 03:16.667
It wasn't the first time...

03:16.750 --> 03:19.709
<i>They're the people</i>
<i>who tell stories to their plants...</i>

03:19.792 --> 03:21.208
I kind of like him.

03:21.291 --> 03:24.500
<i>...and whisper secrets to their pets...</i>

03:24.583 --> 03:26.083
Come on!
Luis ain't no basketball player!

03:26.166 --> 03:28.291
<i>...and have arguments with their TV.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:31.250
He was running like his feet
are made out of lead!

03:31.333 --> 03:35.083
<i>And the loneliest of all</i>
<i>are the ones who talk to people.</i>

03:35.166 --> 03:36.542
You know what I think, Gilbert?

03:36.625 --> 03:39.333
<i>People who are no longer there.</i>

03:39.417 --> 03:40.959
Phone's gonna ring any second

03:41.041 --> 03:44.083
and it's gonna be Lynette begging me
to come over early.

03:45.375 --> 03:49.208
Did I tell you that Tom had surgery
on his back last week?

03:49.291 --> 03:53.667
Yep, that idiot's flat on his ass
while Lynette brings home the bacon

03:53.750 --> 03:55.375
again.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.083
I shouldn't judge.

03:57.166 --> 03:59.959
Plenty of people didn't get
what I saw in you.

04:00.041 --> 04:03.333
I won't name names. My sister Gayle.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.583
You know, I always told her

04:06.667 --> 04:10.500
that beneath all the name-calling
and the dish-throwing,

04:10.583 --> 04:12.291
we really loved each other.

04:14.041 --> 04:16.834
Bet you 50 bucks it's Lynette.

04:16.917 --> 04:18.750
Hello?

04:19.291 --> 04:21.417
You lose, Gilbert. What's up?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.000
I have to get to the restaurant early.

04:23.083 --> 04:26.125
Is there any way you could come over
and get the kids off to school?

04:26.208 --> 04:28.375
Hey, why am I seeing pyjamas?
Get dressed.

04:28.458 --> 04:31.709
Yeah, they are ready to go.
So what do you say?

04:31.834 --> 04:35.917
Oh, great. Thanks. I owe you big time.
Okay, bye.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.917
All right. I'm heading out of here.
Wish me luck.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.166
More interviews this morning?

04:40.250 --> 04:41.542
Yeah, but don't worry,

04:41.625 --> 04:44.375
I'm gonna find you
the assistant manager of your dreams.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.458
Are you sure? Because
the last 10 résumés you showed me...

04:47.542 --> 04:49.083
Yeah, I know, I know.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.000
Bottom of the barrel,
convicts and losers.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.333
You were clear about that last night.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.959
But make sure that they really know
how to wrangle the employees.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.375
Like Kim, she never buses her tables.

04:57.458 --> 05:00.291
- I'm the one that told you that.
- Oh, you're right.

05:00.375 --> 05:03.083
Hey, honey, I had an idea
about the specials for today.

05:03.166 --> 05:05.458
I was thinking
goat cheese and mushrooms.

05:05.542 --> 05:08.500
Oh, for God's sake, Tom!

05:11.792 --> 05:14.291
I'm gonna be late for the interviews.
I really should go.

05:14.375 --> 05:17.625
Honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I know I am driving you crazy.

05:17.709 --> 05:21.250
It's just that I'm feeling so guilty
laying here, totally worthless,

05:21.333 --> 05:23.250
while you run the restaurant
and the house.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.875
It's okay. I am gonna find a way
to make this all work.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.667
And you just get better.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.667
Oh, Mrs McCluskey. Perfect timing.

05:31.750 --> 05:35.083
Hey, make sure you have
your cell phone with you.

05:35.166 --> 05:39.166
Then while you're interviewing,
I'll call, you can conference me in.

05:40.041 --> 05:42.417
That is a great idea.

05:44.583 --> 05:45.709
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:45.792 --> 05:47.667
At some point,
Tom's gonna ask you to look for this.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.625
You will not find it.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.458
Great. Love you.

05:56.542 --> 05:57.583
Here's your beer.

05:57.667 --> 06:01.375
Oh, good job, chipmunk.
No foam this time.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.208
I tipped the glass
just like you told me to.

06:04.291 --> 06:08.041
I think someone's ready
to salt his first margarita glass.

06:10.291 --> 06:13.208
Mommy, do you have trouble
going to sleep?

06:14.166 --> 06:15.542
No.

06:16.166 --> 06:17.333
Why do you ask?

06:17.417 --> 06:20.208
'Cause I heard Carlos say
you were bad in bed.

06:20.291 --> 06:21.750
What?

06:21.834 --> 06:24.667
Why'd he say that?
Do you have nightmares?

06:24.750 --> 06:27.750
Okay, sweetie, I need you to focus.

06:27.834 --> 06:31.625
What exactly did Carlos say,
and who did he say it to?

06:31.709 --> 06:33.750
I went to get my soccer ball
from his yard.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.291
He was on the phone
talking to someone.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.917
So what does "bad in bed" mean?

06:40.917 --> 06:45.000
Oh, it means
that you're not good at making

06:46.417 --> 06:48.375
your bed.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.875
And Mommy doesn't like people saying
she can't make a bed

06:50.959 --> 06:57.250
because, trust me, nobody makes
a bed as good as your mommy.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.667
If you want,
I can tell people you're good in bed.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.959
No, no, no. That's fine, sweetie.

07:05.041 --> 07:08.208
If you want to help Mommy,

07:08.959 --> 07:11.458
just top off her breakfast.

07:18.667 --> 07:22.792
Susan, I'm by the orange stand.
Where are you?

07:22.875 --> 07:24.375
The cheese stand.

07:24.458 --> 07:26.583
No, I don't mind you going back
for free samples,

07:26.667 --> 07:30.000
but if you like it so much,
why not just buy some?

07:30.333 --> 07:34.417
Yeah, of course, you're right.
It always tastes better when it's free.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.583
Okay, then, please hurry.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.875
Oh. Hello.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.083
Hey.

07:43.709 --> 07:46.250
Boy, you're everywhere these days.

07:46.709 --> 07:47.792
Excuse me?

07:47.875 --> 07:50.250
Yesterday Susan and I ran into you
at the post office.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.542
Last week, the movies.

07:51.625 --> 07:53.375
One might think you're following us.

07:53.458 --> 07:57.875
Trust me, one has better things to do
than follow you around.

07:59.125 --> 08:02.291
And yet here you are again.

08:03.959 --> 08:06.583
Ian, Fairview's a small town.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.333
You want distance? Move to the city.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.750
You've been awfully quiet since we left
the market. Is everything okay?

08:21.834 --> 08:26.667
Well, since you ask,
I'm having some problems at work.

08:26.750 --> 08:28.000
Really?

08:28.083 --> 08:32.250
Yes, we're in the midst
of some corporate restructuring.

08:32.333 --> 08:35.083
I'm gonna have to spend more time
in London.

08:35.583 --> 08:36.625
Oh.

08:38.291 --> 08:39.458
Okay.

08:40.333 --> 08:45.625
And I was thinking,
maybe you and I should just relocate.

08:46.750 --> 08:49.333
To London? Permanently?

08:49.417 --> 08:50.834
I know it's sudden, but...

08:50.917 --> 08:52.542
Yeah! It's sudden.

08:52.625 --> 08:54.667
My whole life is here. My friends...

08:54.750 --> 08:56.291
Julie is still in school.

08:56.375 --> 08:57.959
Susan!

09:16.000 --> 09:18.458
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

09:18.542 --> 09:20.542
I'm fine. I'm fine.

09:20.625 --> 09:26.375
Okay. I can feel the car sinking.
We're gonna have to get to shore.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.500
Ian?

09:30.583 --> 09:32.917
How deep do you think this water is?

09:34.709 --> 09:38.125
Deep enough. Come on, let's move!

09:38.959 --> 09:40.333
Susan,

09:41.625 --> 09:43.166
I can't swim.

09:43.542 --> 09:47.917
What? You...
You said you played water polo.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.125
I said polo! With horses!

09:50.208 --> 09:53.208
How can you not know how to swim?
Didn't you go to summer camp?

09:53.291 --> 09:55.375
I stayed in the canoe! Let it go!

09:55.458 --> 09:58.333
Okay, don't panic.

09:58.917 --> 10:02.208
Just grab onto my neck,
and I'll swim for the both of us.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.250
I'm twice your size. We might drown.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.500
Let's just stay here
and think of something else.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.667
If you stay here, you'll definitely drown.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.375
You see how my plan is better?

10:18.834 --> 10:21.625
Oh, look,
there's somebody on the shore!

10:23.250 --> 10:27.667
- It's Mike! He's here!
- Of course he is.

10:27.750 --> 10:29.375
Mike!

10:42.792 --> 10:45.417
Okay, okay, okay, I can walk from here!

10:45.500 --> 10:49.000
Sorry.
You were just gripping me so tight.

10:50.750 --> 10:54.583
Oh, my God. Mike, you saved our lives.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.625
And our cheese!

10:58.709 --> 11:04.375
Ian, can you believe it?
Mike saved our cheese.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.291
Yes. He's quite the hero.

11:06.375 --> 11:08.792
Yeah. Good thing I was following you.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.083
Arnie, thanks for coming in.

11:17.166 --> 11:19.792
We will definitely keep you in mind.

11:19.875 --> 11:24.166
Okay. Okay.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.959
Come on.
What was wrong with that guy?

11:27.583 --> 11:30.667
He kept asking what we do
with the food people don't eat.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.625
All right, so he's a fat loser.

11:32.709 --> 11:35.083
I mean, who'd you expect
to get for $8.50 an hour?

11:35.166 --> 11:37.208
Well, that's what we pay you,
and you seem happy enough.

11:37.291 --> 11:40.250
Well, that's because
I'm doing the beer delivery guy.

11:40.333 --> 11:44.125
Okay. My fault for asking.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.959
Rick Coletti?

11:49.041 --> 11:51.667
- That's me.
- Oh, great. Come on over.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.375
Your application?

11:55.583 --> 11:56.959
One second.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.750
That's been bothering me. Sorry.

12:02.834 --> 12:06.375
No, it's great. You can spell.
You are now officially the front-runner.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.875
Yeah, my grandma came over
from Naples.

12:08.959 --> 12:12.375
I've been making calzones
since before you were born.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.583
How old do you think I am?

12:15.291 --> 12:16.875
Thirty? Thirty-one?

12:17.542 --> 12:21.333
Not afraid to shamelessly ass-kiss.
You are doing very well.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.667
Great. You wanna skip ahead
to the part where you hire me?

12:23.750 --> 12:27.709
Well, I should probably take a look
at your application first.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.667
Okay.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.000
Okay, don't be afraid
if you don't have a tonne of experience.

12:33.083 --> 12:35.667
I realise for what we're paying,
we're not exactly gonna get a...

12:36.458 --> 12:37.500
Whoa!

12:38.166 --> 12:39.917
You were sous chef at Cucina?

12:40.000 --> 12:42.792
- Yeah.
- That's a five-star restaurant.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.959
- Actually, four.
- Which is four more than we have.

12:46.041 --> 12:51.208
Yeah, but this place has character
and charm, and a beautiful owner.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.583
Yeah, but seriously,

12:55.667 --> 12:58.542
why would a four-star chef wanna slum
at a pizza joint?

13:01.125 --> 13:04.917
Mrs McCluskey! Mrs McCluskey!

13:05.000 --> 13:07.458
I'm right here. Keep your shirt on.

13:07.542 --> 13:08.875
I need another pill.

13:08.959 --> 13:13.166
And please tell the kids
to turn down the TV.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.959
I yell, they turn it down.
I walk away, they turn it up.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.083
Vicious circle.

13:17.291 --> 13:20.291
Surely you can control five little kids.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.458
- Can I beat them?
- No.

13:22.542 --> 13:25.000
Then my hands are tied.

13:25.083 --> 13:29.959
Hi, I'm home! And I've got good news.
I found a new manager.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.458
- That's terrific.
- Yeah.

13:31.542 --> 13:35.834
His name is Rick Coletti
and he was a sous chef at Cucina.

13:35.917 --> 13:38.291
Cucina?
Why does he wanna work at our place?

13:38.375 --> 13:42.083
Yeah, I had that exact same thought.
And to be honest, he has a history.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.333
History?

13:43.417 --> 13:46.166
You know how stressful it is
working at a four-star restaurant.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.834
And he, like many chefs,
started using cocaine, just to...

13:48.917 --> 13:52.291
- Oh, no, no, no. No way.
- He's been clean for almost a year.

13:52.375 --> 13:54.041
We're not the Betty Ford clinic.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.375
No, I know, but I've got
a really good feeling about this guy.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.041
All he wants is a fresh start.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.750
I am not gonna hire a junkie
who's gonna turn around

14:00.834 --> 14:03.750
and then hock our jukebox
just to feed his habit.

14:03.834 --> 14:06.458
- Here. No, find somebody else.
- I can't find somebody else.

14:06.542 --> 14:07.959
I've interviewed 50 guys

14:08.041 --> 14:10.542
and this "junkie" happens
to be the best of the bunch.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.041
Seriously, Tom,
I don't know how much longer I can...

14:13.125 --> 14:14.834
Lynette, please,
can we just talk about this later?

14:14.917 --> 14:16.500
I'm in a lot of pain right now.

14:18.083 --> 14:20.083
I'm sorry.

14:20.166 --> 14:24.125
Please, just do what I am asking.

14:24.875 --> 14:29.125
Fine. I'll keep looking.

14:31.125 --> 14:32.333
Jerk.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.417
I had such a good time tonight.
Who knew you could dance?

14:37.500 --> 14:39.166
It's one of my many hidden talents.

14:39.250 --> 14:40.542
Tell you what.
You invite me in for a drink,

14:40.625 --> 14:43.333
- I'll show you another one.
- Not tonight, thanks.

14:43.417 --> 14:46.208
So you would tango with a man
and then not have sex with him?

14:46.291 --> 14:48.917
You know, that's actually
against the law in Argentina.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.333
Come on, we both know
it's gonna happen eventually.

14:51.417 --> 14:55.583
And every time you say that,
"eventually" gets a little further away.

14:55.667 --> 14:58.041
Stop begging, or I'm not going
to your rally tomorrow.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.875
Okay, fine. I can be patient.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.583
As far as I'm concerned,
the chase is half the fun.

15:02.667 --> 15:07.792
Half the fun?
Oh, honey, if I ever do say yes,

15:13.291 --> 15:17.458
you're gonna adjust
that percentage way down.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.125
You can't possibly be
eating more cheese.

15:30.208 --> 15:33.291
What? You've never heard
of a midnight snack?

15:33.917 --> 15:37.917
Unless you can think of something else
that I can nibble on.

15:39.625 --> 15:44.000
Slide over,
you cheddar-breathed tease.

15:50.875 --> 15:55.125
- Oh, what's that?
- Oh, it's a thank-you gift for Mike.

15:55.208 --> 15:56.250
Oh, okay.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.417
Correct me if I'm wrong,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.709
but didn't we already thank him
at the shore,

16:00.792 --> 16:02.458
and again when he dropped us off
at home?

16:02.542 --> 16:05.375
Well, I don't think
you can really thank somebody

16:05.458 --> 16:07.208
too many times for saving your life.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.834
Oh, I wish you'd stop saying that.

16:08.917 --> 16:11.000
- Saying what?
- That he saved my life.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.291
I'm fairly certain
I could've survived without his help.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.417
And if anyone did any life-saving,
it was me.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.083
- You?
- Yes.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.291
If I hadn't warned you about the deer,

16:18.375 --> 16:20.000
it would've gone straight
through the windshield,

16:20.083 --> 16:22.834
and you would've ended up
with an antler through your brain.

16:22.917 --> 16:24.000
Oh.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.792
Okay.

16:28.208 --> 16:30.542
- That's a good point.
- Thank you.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.959
But we were in a bit of a jam there,

16:34.875 --> 16:37.875
and I don't think you should be
embarrassed for needing a little help.

16:37.959 --> 16:41.166
I'm not embarrassed.
I don't feel emasculated either.

16:41.250 --> 16:47.083
Emasculated? Who said emasculated?
And why are you not kissing me now?

16:47.709 --> 16:49.667
I'm ready when you are.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.083
Oh, okay.

17:01.583 --> 17:06.583
I guess we're gonna cut right to the...
Whoa. Wow.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.000
Don't worry. It happens to everybody.

17:26.709 --> 17:31.417
- Maybe it would help to talk about it.
- No. I don't want to talk about it.

17:32.709 --> 17:36.458
All right. We won't talk about it.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.959
Want some cheese?

17:52.417 --> 17:53.500
Hey, how are you?

17:53.583 --> 17:59.083
I'm good.
You might not think so, but I am good.

17:59.458 --> 18:00.500
Huh?

18:01.500 --> 18:05.875
Where in the hell do you get off
telling people that I am bad in bed?

18:05.959 --> 18:08.667
- I never said that!
- Travers heard you on the phone.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.333
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was talking to my cousin in Tucson,

18:12.417 --> 18:14.959
and we always trade bad date stories.

18:16.458 --> 18:20.417
And to think that I went out of my way
to spare your feelings.

18:20.792 --> 18:23.375
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You think you were bored?

18:23.458 --> 18:26.458
I've had more thrills leaning up
against my dryer.

18:26.542 --> 18:28.250
Then what was all that moaning?

18:28.333 --> 18:31.083
I was in pain!
You were smashing my breasts.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.583
Oh, come on!

18:32.667 --> 18:35.917
You hunkered down on top of me like
you were hiding from the border patrol.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.542
I was tired! You just laid there
while I did all the work.

18:38.625 --> 18:41.208
When we were done,
I felt like I should deflate you.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.583
Yeah, well, sex is like tennis.

18:43.667 --> 18:47.041
When you play an inferior opponent,
your game suffers.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.291
Are you challenging me to a rematch?

18:54.083 --> 18:57.375
- Maybe.
- So you wanna do it again.

18:58.417 --> 19:00.959
If it'll shut you up,

19:01.542 --> 19:04.792
yeah, I'll fall on that grenade.

19:05.709 --> 19:09.166
Oh, there's gonna be an explosion.
Come on.

19:21.834 --> 19:23.959
I'm prescribing a mild painkiller
for your back.

19:24.041 --> 19:27.250
And I will see you in a week
to remove those stitches.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.417
Great.

19:28.500 --> 19:32.542
So how'd you folks get so banged up?
Car accident?

19:33.792 --> 19:35.083
Bad sex.

19:38.250 --> 19:39.709
Really bad.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.291
Okay.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.083
Thanks.

19:48.792 --> 19:50.542
God, what a disaster.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.458
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.

19:54.500 --> 19:55.583
How so?

19:55.667 --> 19:58.834
Well, we got it out of our system.
Now we can go back to being friends.

19:58.917 --> 20:02.959
I mean, we like hanging out,
and Travers adores you.

20:03.542 --> 20:05.959
Yeah, and I wouldn't want to ruin that.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.375
Still, it doesn't make any sense.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.250
Oh, I know. I'm hot, you're hot.

20:12.333 --> 20:15.291
On paper, we should
be having great sex.

20:16.792 --> 20:19.083
Well, we could always try again.

20:21.625 --> 20:23.375
Yeah, me neither.

20:24.792 --> 20:29.625
<i>Yes, this town is hungry for change.</i>

20:29.709 --> 20:33.542
<i>When Gabrielle agreed to attend</i>
<i>Victor Lang's campaign rally,</i>

20:33.625 --> 20:37.166
<i>she was fully prepared to be bored.</i>

20:37.250 --> 20:41.667
<i>I give you the next mayor of Fairview,</i>
<i>Victor Lang!</i>

20:43.250 --> 20:45.917
<i>But when Victor took the stage,</i>

20:46.000 --> 20:50.291
<i>Gabrielle found herself</i>
<i>strangely enthralled.</i>

20:50.375 --> 20:54.291
<i>Perhaps it was the cheers</i>
<i>that greeted his arrival.</i>

20:55.709 --> 21:00.500
<i>Perhaps it was</i>
<i>the confidence he exuded.</i>

21:00.834 --> 21:06.417
<i>Or perhaps it was the effect he had</i>
<i>on the citizens of Fairview.</i>

21:06.500 --> 21:10.250
<i>Whatever the reason, Gabby decided,</i>

21:10.333 --> 21:14.041
<i>not only did Victor Lang</i>
<i>have her vote...</i>

21:14.125 --> 21:15.291
Thank you.

21:15.375 --> 21:20.458
<i>...it was time to make</i>
<i>a campaign contribution.</i>

21:20.542 --> 21:25.417
Sorry, excuse me, excuse me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:26.500 --> 21:31.458
I'm afraid Mr Lang has to take
an important meeting in his limo.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.667
Now.

21:37.041 --> 21:38.750
To the radio station, Clyde.

21:39.375 --> 21:43.166
- So what's all this about?
- Your speech. I liked it.

21:46.667 --> 21:49.709
Seriously? Here? Now?

21:49.792 --> 21:53.166
Well, you laid out all your positions.

21:53.250 --> 21:57.458
Don't you want to get acquainted
with mine?

21:59.083 --> 22:01.000
Clyde, could you put up
the partition, please?

22:01.083 --> 22:05.917
- Yes, sir. Anything else?
- Music. Loud music.

22:17.709 --> 22:21.375
Mrs McCluskey!
It has been 10 minutes.

22:21.458 --> 22:24.125
Where's my pie?

22:24.917 --> 22:28.125
I'm unloading the dishwasher.
You get your damn pie when I'm done.

22:29.709 --> 22:31.250
Mrs McCluskey!

22:35.041 --> 22:37.542
I want my pie now.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.417
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you heard me.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.125
Your being here isn't charity.
We pay you good money to help us.

22:45.208 --> 22:47.917
So when I ask you to do something,
I want it done!

22:52.000 --> 22:56.166
Well, here's a surprise for you. I quit.

22:56.583 --> 23:00.000
What? What? Why? Why?
What happened?

23:00.083 --> 23:01.542
Five kids are tough enough,

23:01.625 --> 23:03.959
but your husband makes six,
and that's where I draw the line.

23:04.041 --> 23:07.333
Okay. I know that Tom has been
a little cranky lately...

23:07.417 --> 23:11.166
No, I'm cranky. He's insufferable.
I hate to admit this, Lynette,

23:11.250 --> 23:14.625
but every time that man screams out
in pain, I do a little jig inside.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.041
Look, I'll talk to Tom.

23:16.125 --> 23:18.291
- No, my mind's made up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

23:18.458 --> 23:20.583
Please don't do this.
Please, I am at the end of my rope.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.417
I wish I could help you, Lynette.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.917
I can see that you're going down,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
but I'm just too old
to get dragged down with you.

23:39.250 --> 23:43.959
Okay, everybody, go on up to bed.
Parker, you got the baby.

23:44.041 --> 23:47.458
Yeah, that's exactly right.
You know what to do.

23:49.792 --> 23:52.959
Before you speak, just know that
ever since McCluskey left,

23:53.041 --> 23:56.834
I've been lying here feeling
like the biggest jerk ever.

23:57.250 --> 24:01.166
Tomorrow morning,
I am gonna call her and apologise.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.333
I will fix this.

24:06.583 --> 24:09.458
Well, you might also want to apologise

24:09.542 --> 24:13.166
to the customer who found a Lego
in her pizza.

24:13.542 --> 24:15.834
Oh, God, did the kids do that?

24:16.417 --> 24:17.667
I hope.

24:17.959 --> 24:23.166
Oh, God, it was so awful tonight.

24:23.250 --> 24:26.583
Oh, honey. You know what you need?

24:27.583 --> 24:28.750
What?

24:31.083 --> 24:32.625
A seeing to.

24:33.709 --> 24:36.625
Once the kids are asleep,

24:36.709 --> 24:41.625
slip on that sexy blue thing
and then sneak back down here.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.875
You wanna have sex?

24:44.959 --> 24:47.291
But you're immobile.

24:47.375 --> 24:50.917
Okay, maybe full-on sex
is a little ambitious,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.709
but there's other stuff that we could do.

24:55.792 --> 24:57.583
But you can't bend at the waist,

24:57.667 --> 25:01.750
and that pretty much leaves
the heavy lifting to me.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.917
Trust me,
if you get us to the finish line,

25:05.667 --> 25:07.375
I will cross it.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.291
Is that why you apologised?
Just so I'd service you?

25:13.375 --> 25:17.834
Honey, I have been trapped in this bed
all day long. I'm bored, I'm miserable.

25:17.917 --> 25:20.750
Can't you do this one little thing
for me?

25:21.875 --> 25:26.208
I have been doing everything
I can to keep our heads above water.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.583
I can't do you, too.

25:34.709 --> 25:38.458
<i>For Gabrielle, the best part</i>
<i>of having sex with a new man</i>

25:38.542 --> 25:42.750
<i>was seeing how quickly his affection</i>
<i>would turn to obsession.</i>

25:42.834 --> 25:44.417
<i>No messages.</i>

25:45.458 --> 25:48.709
<i>But when Victor failed to call</i>
<i>the next morning...</i>

25:48.792 --> 25:51.250
<i>No messages.</i>

25:51.333 --> 25:54.792
<i>...or the next afternoon...</i>

25:54.875 --> 25:56.125
<i>No messages.</i>

25:56.208 --> 25:59.625
<i>...it was Gabrielle</i>
<i>who began obsessing.</i>

26:00.792 --> 26:02.500
Not a peep. 24 hours.

26:02.583 --> 26:05.166
Well, he's busy.
Isn't he debating the mayor tonight?

26:05.250 --> 26:07.583
I don't care.
He can find two lousy minutes for me.

26:08.250 --> 26:10.875
I'm here. Deal me in.

26:10.959 --> 26:14.959
Sorry, no poker today.
Lynette had to work. Want a margarita?

26:15.041 --> 26:17.709
Well, I'd like three,
but I'll start with one.

26:17.792 --> 26:20.583
Ms Solis? Sorry to interrupt.
You have any water?

26:20.667 --> 26:21.834
Yeah, in the fridge.

26:28.875 --> 26:30.959
Who is that?

26:31.375 --> 26:34.709
And why don't you put your water
on a lower shelf?

26:35.709 --> 26:37.458
Thank you.

26:37.542 --> 26:39.625
That's Toby. He's fixing my closet.

26:39.709 --> 26:42.792
Has your cocky boyfriend
gotten a load of the help?

26:42.875 --> 26:46.250
- Move away from that topic.
- We had sex yesterday, in his limo...

26:46.333 --> 26:49.417
Oh, I love limo sex.
Town car or stretch?

26:49.500 --> 26:52.208
Well, stretch, of course.
I'm not a complete slut.

26:52.792 --> 26:56.000
- Point is, he hasn't called since.
- Oh.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.500
So how was the sex?

26:58.583 --> 27:01.625
Fantastic. As good as with Carlos.

27:02.583 --> 27:03.959
That good, huh?

27:04.083 --> 27:06.083
God, I'm such an idiot.

27:06.166 --> 27:08.542
I gave it up way too fast.
Now I've lost all the power.

27:08.625 --> 27:09.959
Oh, come on.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.667
No, I'm serious.
Our mothers had the right idea.

27:12.750 --> 27:15.125
They let men think they were
the only ones who needed sex

27:15.208 --> 27:17.166
and women just went along as a favour.

27:17.250 --> 27:20.333
Men begged for every crumb,
and we never lost the upper hand.

27:20.417 --> 27:23.375
Yeah, no guy respects
an easy conquest.

27:23.458 --> 27:25.500
I make all my men wait.

27:25.583 --> 27:29.709
It's true. She has a little room
with magazines and an aquarium.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.500
I have so missed our friendship.

27:34.500 --> 27:37.834
I think if you really like this guy,
you should just be honest.

27:37.917 --> 27:39.875
You should tell him
that you feel a little hurt...

27:39.959 --> 27:43.458
Oh, yeah. Whining is really
gonna bring him to his knees.

27:43.625 --> 27:45.458
You want to get this guy back in line?

27:45.583 --> 27:49.208
You hit him hard, hit him fast.
Is he the jealous type?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.291
Aren't they all?

27:52.875 --> 27:54.959
So what should
I do to make him jealous?

27:55.041 --> 27:56.917
I got all the shelves up.

27:57.291 --> 27:58.750
Anything else?

28:05.333 --> 28:08.542
<i>My opponent thinks</i>
<i>we should combat prostitution</i>

28:08.625 --> 28:11.750
<i>by mounting surveillance cameras</i>
<i>to embarrass the customers.</i>

28:12.667 --> 28:16.500
<i>I call that a blatant violation</i>
<i>of our citizens' privacy.</i>

28:16.583 --> 28:18.750
Mr Mayor,
if you're so worried about privacy,

28:18.834 --> 28:21.083
just wear a hat, keep your head down
and you'll be fine.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.583
Okay, thank you very much,
gentlemen.

28:25.667 --> 28:29.291
So let's move on to our next subject.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.667
You both have said our citizens
pay too much in taxes.

28:32.750 --> 28:37.333
How would you attract new businesses
to boost the city's tax base?

28:38.583 --> 28:39.917
Mr Lang?

28:42.125 --> 28:43.500
Mr Lang?

28:43.583 --> 28:47.875
I'm sorry, would you repeat
the question, please?

28:47.959 --> 28:51.542
How would you bring new business
to Fairview?

28:52.583 --> 28:56.250
I would offer tax exemptions

28:56.333 --> 28:58.166
to first year start-ups.

28:58.250 --> 29:02.333
And that will increase our tax base?

29:02.417 --> 29:07.959
No, of course not.
Not at first, but when conjoined with...

29:11.375 --> 29:14.750
My opponent seems
a bit overtaxed himself.

29:19.542 --> 29:24.375
Gentlemen, there's been much talk
lately regarding our local schools.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.792
What would you do
to improve public education?

29:27.875 --> 29:29.333
Mr Lang?

29:33.792 --> 29:36.250
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.

29:36.333 --> 29:38.959
- Miss? Please?
- I will be right there.

29:41.208 --> 29:43.583
Oh, my God! Mrs Scavo, I am so sorry.

29:43.667 --> 29:46.500
- Don't cry. Just clean.
- Miss, if you could just...

29:46.583 --> 29:48.709
I swear, I will be there in one second.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.834
Here you go. Here.

29:51.625 --> 29:52.667
Yeah?

29:53.542 --> 29:55.250
Let me guess, this a bad time?

29:55.333 --> 29:58.625
Oh, my God, Rick.
I never got back to you. I am so sorry.

29:58.709 --> 30:03.333
That's okay. I didn't mind waiting,
so long as it's good news for me now.

30:03.750 --> 30:07.083
Look, I think you're great,
and we would be lucky to have you.

30:07.166 --> 30:11.000
It's just my husband
isn't really comfortable...

30:11.083 --> 30:14.125
With an ex-drug addict in his kitchen.

30:14.208 --> 30:17.959
You can drug test me every week.
Anything you want.

30:18.041 --> 30:21.709
Just... I really need this job.

30:23.583 --> 30:28.208
- Miss!
- Could you excuse me a second?

30:28.291 --> 30:31.041
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's up?

30:31.125 --> 30:33.875
- I hate my calzone.
- Oh. What's wrong with it?

30:33.959 --> 30:36.208
It's just not good, and I want a new one.

30:36.291 --> 30:38.208
All right, all right.
I will put your order in,

30:38.291 --> 30:39.709
but the kitchen's a little backed up.

30:39.792 --> 30:43.500
Not my problem!
You gave me a sucky calzone.

30:43.583 --> 30:46.583
I don't care if you have
to get back there and make it yourself!

30:53.667 --> 30:56.709
I can't do this.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.917
It's just...

31:10.375 --> 31:12.041
What is this?

31:13.959 --> 31:15.750
I'll make you a new calzone, sir.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.583
Fresh basil, garlic.
You like sun dried tomatoes?

31:18.667 --> 31:20.959
Yeah, sounds good.

31:21.041 --> 31:24.000
Hey, is she all right?

31:24.083 --> 31:27.125
Yeah.
It's her grandma's calzone recipe.

31:27.208 --> 31:29.792
She takes criticism very personally.

31:31.875 --> 31:36.542
Prep some dough for a calzone for me,
and get someone to chop some basil.

31:37.542 --> 31:39.625
Yeah, okay. Who are you?

31:40.417 --> 31:43.125
- I'm Rick.
- You work here now?

31:49.458 --> 31:51.166
Looks like I do.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.375
Oh, is that new?

32:00.458 --> 32:01.917
I just bought it.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.041
But if you don't like it,
feel free to rip it off me.

32:06.166 --> 32:09.458
Actually, I have this book proposal
to discuss at an 8:00 a.m. meeting,

32:09.542 --> 32:11.041
so I can't really...

32:11.125 --> 32:14.709
Oh, that's okay.
If you gotta work, you gotta work.

32:16.250 --> 32:20.041
So I was thinking about London.

32:20.417 --> 32:22.166
- Oh?
- Yeah.

32:23.792 --> 32:26.834
Julie's gonna be applying
to colleges soon,

32:26.917 --> 32:31.458
and a year abroad
could give her a real boost.

32:32.166 --> 32:36.250
- So let's do it.
- Are you serious?

32:36.792 --> 32:40.542
Yes. I want to spend time in your world.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.083
I want to play cricket,
and I want to eat crumpets

32:44.166 --> 32:46.125
and I want to use the word "ghastly."

32:47.792 --> 32:52.875
God, Susan, you have no idea
how excited this makes me feel.

32:53.625 --> 32:56.208
Well, my thigh's getting an inkling.

32:56.291 --> 32:58.166
We'll call a realtor
first thing in the morning

32:58.250 --> 32:59.917
and put our houses on the market.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.125
Not mine, okay?
That way we can use it when we visit.

33:02.834 --> 33:04.125
That's what hotels are for, darling.

33:04.208 --> 33:07.792
I don't want to sell my house.
Everybody I love is on this street.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.417
- What happened?
- I'm feeling tired.

33:16.834 --> 33:20.834
- You weren't tired a second ago.
- I'm not in the mood, all right?

33:21.792 --> 33:22.917
Why not?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.917
You know, I'm not used to being grilled
about my sex drive.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.417
Well, I'm not used to guys bailing
on me in the middle of foreplay.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.208
And by guys, of course,
you mean Mike.

33:32.291 --> 33:33.375
What?

33:33.458 --> 33:36.583
Oh, I'm sure good old Mike
was ready and able 24/7.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.542
You're not actually...

33:41.667 --> 33:44.208
Oh, okay. That's it.

33:45.709 --> 33:47.291
- I've had it.
- Susan!

33:47.375 --> 33:50.834
No, really. I can't have
this conversation one more time.

33:50.917 --> 33:54.250
I've done nothing but prove my love
to you for the last year,

33:54.333 --> 33:56.125
and you cannot shut up about Mike.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.291
I don't trust the man!

33:57.375 --> 34:01.291
But you don't have to trust Mike!
You have to trust me and you don't!

34:03.792 --> 34:05.959
That's what going to England's about,
isn't it?

34:06.041 --> 34:08.291
You're just trying to get me away
from Mike.

34:08.959 --> 34:10.875
Well, you know what? Screw it.
I'm not going.

34:10.959 --> 34:13.250
And if you ever bring up
his name again, we're over!

34:13.333 --> 34:14.959
Got it? Over!

34:39.625 --> 34:43.333
Hi. This is from me and Ian.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.709
An electric juicer?

34:48.875 --> 34:52.583
Yeah, well, you know,
you try to think of a more appropriate

34:52.667 --> 34:54.709
"Thank you for saving my life" gift.

34:58.083 --> 35:00.959
This works fine for me.

35:01.542 --> 35:02.667
Good.

35:09.834 --> 35:11.208
I should go.

35:12.917 --> 35:14.250
You okay?

35:16.291 --> 35:19.792
Yeah. I'm good.

35:20.959 --> 35:22.792
You sure about that?

35:24.625 --> 35:25.750
Yeah.

35:27.583 --> 35:28.834
Yeah, it's just...

35:32.125 --> 35:37.417
You know, Ian and I had a little thing.

36:03.250 --> 36:06.000
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.208
- Ian, about what I said...
- You were right.

36:14.750 --> 36:17.667
You've never given me reason
to doubt you.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.625
I'm an insecure idiot.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.166
I don't deserve you, Susan.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.625
But if you'll please keep pretending
that I do,

36:26.709 --> 36:30.083
I swear, I will not utter
a single jealous word

36:30.166 --> 36:32.417
for the rest of our lives together.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.458
<i>Gabby, it's Victor.</i>
<i>What the hell were you thinking?</i>

36:56.542 --> 36:59.375
<i>That little stunt of yours</i>
<i>almost cost me the debate.</i>

37:04.417 --> 37:06.834
<i>It's me again. Okay, I get it.</i>

37:06.917 --> 37:09.667
<i>I forgot to call, and you were mad.</i>
<i>But still...</i>

37:15.250 --> 37:17.083
<i>Hi, I hope you got the flowers.</i>

37:17.166 --> 37:19.417
<i>Again, I am so sorry for not calling.</i>

37:25.291 --> 37:28.250
<i>Gabby, come on, what's it gonna take</i>
<i>for you to forgive me?</i>

37:28.333 --> 37:29.917
<i>I'll do anything you want.</i>

37:37.417 --> 37:39.208
I brought you some flowers.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.458
In case the other three bouquets
get lonely.

37:41.542 --> 37:43.542
Thank you. You can go now.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.792
I don't want to take any more time
out of your busy schedule.

37:45.875 --> 37:46.917
For God's sake, Gabby.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.917
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

37:50.041 --> 37:51.959
What I did was thoughtless
and inconsiderate.

37:52.041 --> 37:54.542
- Yes, it was.
- But what you did was flat out vicious.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.041
- Just trying to get your attention.
- By humiliating me in public?

37:57.125 --> 38:00.041
Hey, you hurt me. If I have
to strike back hard to protect myself...

38:00.125 --> 38:02.583
Is that what you think this is? Combat?

38:02.667 --> 38:05.709
I've been taken for granted before and
I'm not going to let it happen again.

38:05.792 --> 38:08.875
If I'm going to give myself to you,
you damn well better worship me.

38:08.959 --> 38:12.250
And I will do that.
Morning and evening services.

38:12.709 --> 38:13.750
Good.

38:14.083 --> 38:15.542
But you have to stop treating
this relationship

38:15.625 --> 38:18.583
like it's a boxing match
only one of us can win.

38:18.667 --> 38:21.875
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.

38:21.959 --> 38:25.625
So it'd be nice if you could take
the gloves off and trust me.

38:26.709 --> 38:28.709
You're in love with me?

38:29.125 --> 38:30.458
Yeah.

38:33.333 --> 38:36.333
My campaign, that's about winning.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.500
This, you and me, it's about happiness.

38:42.875 --> 38:45.250
And we could both use a little.

38:48.083 --> 38:50.917
But maybe you need some more time
to think about it.

39:05.417 --> 39:08.041
Look, no gloves.

39:18.083 --> 39:22.000
Travers conked out the moment
his head hit the pillow.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.083
Poor little guy was beat.

39:24.417 --> 39:28.000
Well, he should be.
We covered every inch of that zoo.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.458
Oh, check this out.
You and Travers at the monkey house.

39:31.625 --> 39:34.125
Oh, I look squinty. Delete, delete.

39:35.750 --> 39:37.125
Oh, there's the one
the pretzel guy took.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.333
Oh, look at the three of us.
You have to e-mail me that one.

39:40.417 --> 39:41.500
Isn't that great?

39:42.542 --> 39:45.041
You know,
he thought that Travers had my eyes.

39:45.667 --> 39:48.250
- Seriously?
- He totally thought we were a family.

39:48.333 --> 39:53.417
Oh, well, if we were, we'd be one hell
of a good-looking one.

39:54.583 --> 39:57.333
Yeah. Nothing better than family.

40:26.917 --> 40:29.375
Oh, wow.

40:30.625 --> 40:32.959
And this time I really mean it.

40:33.041 --> 40:35.417
Yeah. Me, too.

40:40.834 --> 40:43.125
Well, you gonna say anything?

40:43.667 --> 40:46.583
To be honest,
I've heard better apologies.

40:46.875 --> 40:50.166
But I know how hard
this must have been for you,

40:50.250 --> 40:52.000
and that makes me happy.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.542
So I accept.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.792
Thanks. That's big of you.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.500
And it's big of you
to admit you're a chucklehead.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.667
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:03.083 --> 41:05.917
Did you hear that, Gilbert?
He apologised.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.583
I mean, I know he did it
just for her sake, but still.

41:11.333 --> 41:14.250
Maybe they have
a good marriage after all.

41:15.375 --> 41:19.250
But they'll never have what we had.
Will they, Gilbert?

41:20.291 --> 41:22.250
Not by a long shot.

41:25.000 --> 41:26.125
<i>Passion.</i>

41:26.208 --> 41:31.750
<i>It's a force so potent, we still</i>
<i>remember it long after it's faded away.</i>

41:33.709 --> 41:35.458
<i>A drive so alluring,</i>

41:35.542 --> 41:40.000
<i>it can push us into the arms</i>
<i>of unexpected lovers.</i>

41:42.208 --> 41:44.750
<i>A sensation so overwhelming,</i>

41:44.834 --> 41:49.875
<i>it can knock down walls we have built</i>
<i>to protect our hearts.</i>

41:50.917 --> 41:52.792
<i>A feeling so intense,</i>

41:52.875 --> 41:58.709
<i>it resurfaces even though</i>
<i>we tried so hard to keep it buried.</i>

42:00.750 --> 42:03.333
<i>Yes, of all emotions,</i>

42:03.417 --> 42:08.166
<i>passion is the one that gives us</i>
<i>a reason to live</i>

42:08.792 --> 42:14.417
<i>and an excuse to commit</i>
<i>all sorts of crimes.</i>
