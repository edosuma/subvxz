WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:45.586 --> 00:46.551
Ooof!

00:46.551 --> 00:47.655
I've been craving
this all week.

00:50.275 --> 00:51.172
What?

00:51.827 --> 00:53.344
I don't think I ever
see you as happy

00:53.344 --> 00:54.448
as when we're at
this restaurant.

00:57.482 --> 00:59.793
There are other things
that make me happy.

01:00.137 --> 01:00.896
Oh yeah.

01:00.896 --> 01:02.379
Well I mean,
it's true.

01:02.379 --> 01:03.137
There is the time-

01:12.241 --> 01:13.103
Oh my God!

01:14.827 --> 01:15.448
What?

01:15.448 --> 01:16.344
Behind you.

01:19.689 --> 01:21.206
Is that Chief
Superintendent Archer?

01:21.206 --> 01:23.068
Yeah, that's him.

01:24.413 --> 01:25.310
What's he doing here?

01:26.413 --> 01:28.448
Yeah I can't tell
if he saw us.

01:29.137 --> 01:30.655
Oh my God.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.482
Enjoying the noodles?

01:32.482 --> 01:34.241
I might need
another plate.

01:34.241 --> 01:34.965
On their way.

01:34.965 --> 01:35.689
Thank you.

01:48.103 --> 01:49.103
Hey Mom.

01:50.965 --> 01:51.793
It's busy!

01:53.241 --> 01:54.586
Thank you so much.

01:54.586 --> 01:55.689
You're the best.

01:55.689 --> 01:57.620
I'll call you
later okay?

02:00.793 --> 02:01.896
What are you doing?

02:02.655 --> 02:04.586
He's almost thirty.

02:04.586 --> 02:06.000
You're still
giving him money?

02:06.379 --> 02:07.896
He's my son.

02:11.379 --> 02:12.655
Should we get
a take-out box?

02:14.862 --> 02:16.172
No.

02:16.172 --> 02:17.448
No no no,
we should just relax.

02:17.448 --> 02:20.172
Maybe I'm over-reacting.

02:21.758 --> 02:23.172
Well, maybe
it's a sign.

02:23.172 --> 02:24.758
Things have been
going pretty good.

02:24.758 --> 02:26.206
Maybe we should
tell our friends.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.517
Yeah I mean it
would be awful

02:28.517 --> 02:30.034
if they found out
from the chief.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.586
No Mike, Mike!

02:44.586 --> 02:45.413
Somebody help!

02:45.413 --> 02:46.413
Everybody step
back, step back!

02:46.413 --> 02:47.344
Give the doctor
some space.

02:47.689 --> 02:48.758
Come on.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.862
Yeah I need an ambulance
to Good Taste restaurant

02:54.862 --> 02:56.206
on Water Street.

02:57.482 --> 02:58.965
It's too late.

03:00.551 --> 03:01.448
He's gone.

03:23.517 --> 03:25.344
My sincerest
condolences, Rebecca.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.068
Your husband
was a great man-

03:29.206 --> 03:31.241
deeply respected by
everyone on my team.

03:34.862 --> 03:36.655
When was the last time
you told him that?

03:39.862 --> 03:40.620
He knew that.

03:43.448 --> 03:44.793
Ah, come on.

03:46.068 --> 03:48.344
You remember all those late
nights we spent at the pub

03:48.344 --> 03:49.517
during our rookie days-

03:50.448 --> 03:51.620
the three of us.

03:52.551 --> 03:54.827
He always spoke
very highly of you, Joe.

03:56.931 --> 03:57.931
Even through those years

03:57.931 --> 03:59.827
when you guys weren't
on the best of terms.

04:00.137 --> 04:02.068
We were on
fine terms.

04:02.068 --> 04:04.379
And that history
between us

04:06.413 --> 04:07.793
was water under
the bridge.

04:09.379 --> 04:10.344
You and Mike-

04:10.344 --> 04:12.241
that was real.

04:12.241 --> 04:13.344
It was
meant to be.

04:15.551 --> 04:17.275
Your team is investigating?

04:17.275 --> 04:19.689
Do you have reason to suspect
your husband was murdered?

04:19.689 --> 04:23.000
I swear that we were
being followed.

04:25.517 --> 04:27.103
And there's these.

04:28.931 --> 04:32.413
This hate mail,
death threats.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.172
Did he report this?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.275
Come on,
you know Mike.

04:42.275 --> 04:44.689
He always said that

04:44.689 --> 04:45.931
the letters were
the end of it-

04:45.931 --> 04:47.413
that people just wanted
to say their piece.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.206
And that was enough.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.379
Unless for
someone it wasn't.

05:01.172 --> 05:02.793
So you two were at
the restaurant together?

05:05.103 --> 05:05.758
Uh-

05:07.172 --> 05:08.172
Yeah.

05:08.172 --> 05:10.862
Yeah we were just
grabbing a bite after work.

05:12.034 --> 05:13.724
Oh!

05:13.724 --> 05:15.724
Don't you think the restaurant
across the street is better?

05:16.103 --> 05:17.310
Never tried it.

05:17.310 --> 05:18.448
You should.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.103
I mean everybody in town
has picked their favourite.

05:20.103 --> 05:21.482
Yeah, I like
what I like.

05:21.482 --> 05:22.551
You like
what you like?

05:22.551 --> 05:24.034
Charlie, what
do you think?

05:24.034 --> 05:25.000
You like
what you like?

05:28.586 --> 05:29.275
Yeah.

05:29.275 --> 05:31.034
So I mean-

05:31.034 --> 05:32.379
Chief Archer just
had a heart attack

05:32.379 --> 05:33.793
and keeled over?

05:33.793 --> 05:36.206
No, he showed
signs of poisoning.

05:36.206 --> 05:37.724
So we're just waiting
on test results.

05:37.724 --> 05:39.448
Uh- Jesse.

05:39.448 --> 05:40.344
Do you think
you could

05:40.344 --> 05:43.241
pull up the phone
and financial records?

05:43.241 --> 05:44.482
Yeah I could
do that.

05:44.482 --> 05:46.172
Why- do you think that he's
harbouring some sort of secret

05:46.172 --> 05:47.068
that he
might not be

05:47.068 --> 05:48.620
telling anybody about?

05:48.620 --> 05:50.413
Ah, maybe we should
just cover our bases.

05:50.655 --> 05:51.344
Yeah.

05:51.344 --> 05:52.068
Hey listen team.

05:52.068 --> 05:52.896
Um-

05:52.896 --> 05:54.724
Rebecca Archer
just gave me these.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
They're death threats

05:57.000 --> 05:59.241
that were sent to
Chief Archer recently.

05:59.241 --> 06:01.206
That one there is
the most recent.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.275
Recognize the name?

06:06.620 --> 06:07.586
Rex.

06:26.275 --> 06:27.068
Noel Cameron?

06:27.068 --> 06:27.724
It's the police!

06:27.724 --> 06:28.793
Open up!

06:38.103 --> 06:38.793
Rex.

06:42.172 --> 06:43.172
Aghh!

06:52.068 --> 06:53.206
Aghhh!

07:08.517 --> 07:09.448
Why'd you run, Noel?

07:09.448 --> 07:10.896
I was only going to
ask a few questions.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.620
Are you kidding?

07:12.620 --> 07:13.551
I heard about
Archer's death.

07:13.551 --> 07:15.137
And knew you'd
set me up for it.

07:15.137 --> 07:16.344
Not how this works.

07:16.344 --> 07:17.310
Come on.

07:17.724 --> 07:19.758
Tell that to the
poor schmucks

07:19.758 --> 07:21.551
falsely imprisoned
by the police state!

07:21.551 --> 07:24.034
Is that why you sent
Archer death threats?

07:24.034 --> 07:25.689
Those are just words.

07:25.689 --> 07:27.241
Freedom of speech, man.

07:27.586 --> 07:29.448
Noel, do
your pants up.

07:29.793 --> 07:32.448
Freedom of Expression
in Canada.

07:32.448 --> 07:34.310
And it doesn't apply
to death threats.

07:35.724 --> 07:37.206
So what?

07:37.206 --> 07:39.275
You're gonna let me
freeze to death?

07:40.931 --> 07:42.448
Let's warm up
at the station.

07:50.758 --> 07:52.137
Archer.

07:52.586 --> 07:54.068
Your time is over.

07:54.068 --> 07:56.000
It could be a
year from now.

07:56.000 --> 07:56.758
A month.

07:56.758 --> 07:57.689
A day.

07:57.689 --> 07:58.965
Your life will end.

07:58.965 --> 08:01.482
And I will be there
watching as you

08:01.482 --> 08:03.068
take your last breath.

08:03.068 --> 08:04.620
I am always watching.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.517
Remember that.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.034
It's kind of dramatic,
the way you read it.

08:08.034 --> 08:09.896
Yeah dramatic how
you wrote it too.

08:09.896 --> 08:12.620
You go on to describe
his daily routine.

08:12.620 --> 08:13.551
You were watching him!

08:13.551 --> 08:14.517
Well, yeah.

08:14.517 --> 08:16.241
I said that
in the letter.

08:16.241 --> 08:18.068
You were looking for an
opportunity to strike.

08:18.068 --> 08:19.172
And you found
it last night.

08:19.172 --> 08:21.862
I was no where near
him last night.

08:21.862 --> 08:23.103
Prove it.

08:28.517 --> 08:29.827
Prove I was.

08:29.827 --> 08:31.448
You know what
this looks like to me?

08:31.448 --> 08:34.034
You've been sending
threats to Archer for years.

08:34.034 --> 08:36.310
And last night you
finally decided to act!

08:36.310 --> 08:37.827
Why would
I kill him?

08:38.586 --> 08:39.896
My method worked!

08:39.896 --> 08:41.137
I sent him threats.

08:41.137 --> 08:42.482
And boom!

08:42.482 --> 08:43.965
Retirement announced!

08:43.965 --> 08:44.793
Wait a sec.

08:44.793 --> 08:47.034
Do you think that
you're responsible

08:47.034 --> 08:48.275
for the Archer's
retirement plans?

08:48.275 --> 08:50.517
Obviously.

08:54.586 --> 08:56.137
Listen, you've
been watching Archer right?

08:56.137 --> 08:58.034
Right- don't answer though.

08:58.034 --> 08:59.689
You notice anything unusual?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.103
Are you going
to answer now?

09:03.965 --> 09:06.137
I'm not gonna participate
in the police state!

09:06.137 --> 09:08.000
If you don't
answer me now-

09:09.827 --> 09:11.517
you're going to do a lot
more than participate-

09:11.517 --> 09:12.724
if you know
what I mean.

09:18.137 --> 09:19.724
I did see something.

09:19.724 --> 09:20.862
Yeah?

09:20.862 --> 09:21.827
About a week ago-

09:21.827 --> 09:25.206
he was arguing with
a mean-looking dude.

09:26.068 --> 09:27.310
I think I need a
better description

09:27.310 --> 09:28.344
than mean - looking dude.

09:32.965 --> 09:34.344
Apparently Noel
Cameron can draw.

09:34.344 --> 09:35.862
Thinking of getting
a new tattoo?

09:35.862 --> 09:37.586
No it's not
for me Jesse.

09:37.586 --> 09:40.241
Noel saw this tattoo on
a guy who was arguing

09:40.241 --> 09:41.034
with Chief Archer

09:41.310 --> 09:42.034
Okay.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.275
Well I will send it

09:43.275 --> 09:44.965
to the local
tattoo parlours-

09:44.965 --> 09:46.172
to see if they
can recognize it.

09:46.172 --> 09:47.620
Ah, I like your
magic wand.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.758
Um- any other leads?

09:48.758 --> 09:49.551
Uh no no.

09:49.551 --> 09:50.448
Nothing out
of the ordinary

09:50.827 --> 09:52.413
from Chief Archer's financials-

09:52.413 --> 09:53.655
phone or email.

09:53.655 --> 09:54.827
Yeah, apparently he was
a pretty straight arrow.

09:54.827 --> 09:57.068
All his friends had only
good things to say about him.

09:57.068 --> 09:57.827
Hey Sarah.

09:57.827 --> 09:58.517
You find anything?

09:58.517 --> 09:59.551
Cause of death

09:59.551 --> 10:01.275
was cardiac arrest
caused by aconite poisoning.

10:01.275 --> 10:02.206
Aconite.

10:02.206 --> 10:04.137
Wolfsbane.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.724
You and your classic
mystery novels.

10:05.724 --> 10:07.172
You know-

10:07.172 --> 10:10.310
Wolfsbane was historically
used to poison wolves-

10:11.103 --> 10:12.206
and other wild dogs.

10:13.310 --> 10:14.724
Okay, I'm just
the messenger!

10:15.896 --> 10:17.275
Oh, I'm sorry!

10:18.206 --> 10:20.206
Um- it's also
grown locally.

10:20.206 --> 10:21.137
So anybody
could get it.

10:21.137 --> 10:22.172
How was it administered?

10:22.172 --> 10:22.931
Ingested.

10:22.931 --> 10:24.000
It was in his
stomach contents.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.620
And the leftovers from
the Chicken Royal Stir-fry

10:26.620 --> 10:27.758
I collected from
the restaurant.

10:27.758 --> 10:28.724
That's their
signature dish.

10:28.724 --> 10:29.655
Were there any
other victims?

10:29.655 --> 10:31.689
I called hospitals
and the restaurant.

10:31.689 --> 10:33.000
No other illnesses
were reported.

10:33.000 --> 10:33.724
Okay.

10:33.724 --> 10:35.310
So we can
probably safely say

10:35.310 --> 10:36.344
that Chief Archer's dish

10:36.344 --> 10:37.655
was the only one that
was tampered with.

10:38.344 --> 10:39.275
Well-

10:39.275 --> 10:41.275
I guess we're just
looking for anyone

10:41.275 --> 10:43.103
who had access
to the restaurant.

10:43.103 --> 10:43.793
Come on Rex.

10:51.620 --> 10:54.000
Hard to believe somebody with
such a big presence is gone.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.137
Yeah it's not right
for him to go like this.

10:56.137 --> 10:57.965
He had such big
plans for retirement.

10:57.965 --> 10:58.620
Mm-hmm.

10:58.620 --> 10:59.482
Travel.

10:59.482 --> 11:00.724
Time with the wife.

11:00.724 --> 11:01.482
Yeah.

11:01.482 --> 11:02.206
Golf!

11:02.206 --> 11:03.000
Yes!

11:03.000 --> 11:04.586
Mike Archer loved
to swing a club.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.068
Makes you think,
doesn't it?

11:08.068 --> 11:09.758
Just how quickly
things can change-

11:10.620 --> 11:12.034
just like that.

11:14.000 --> 11:14.758
Yeah.

11:18.275 --> 11:21.310
You know, I heard-

11:21.310 --> 11:24.241
that the board is going to
be naming an interim chief

11:24.241 --> 11:25.379
by the end
of the day.

11:27.034 --> 11:27.965
Yeah.

11:29.137 --> 11:29.965
And the deputy chief

11:29.965 --> 11:32.241
has declined the position

11:32.241 --> 11:33.724
due to personal reasons.

11:35.137 --> 11:36.137
Mmmm.

11:36.655 --> 11:40.034
Which only leaves-

11:44.586 --> 11:46.000
So what do you
want to do?

11:47.758 --> 11:49.448
Drinks after
the shift?

11:49.448 --> 11:50.620
Hmm?

11:51.034 --> 11:52.000
Toast whoever gets it?

11:54.068 --> 11:55.137
You're on.

12:04.275 --> 12:05.655
Your dog shouldn't
be in here.

12:06.689 --> 12:07.862
He's a police officer.

12:07.862 --> 12:09.724
Right now, you have
bigger problems

12:09.724 --> 12:11.310
than Rex in
your kitchen.

12:11.310 --> 12:15.103
Test show that your Royal
Stir-fry contained the poison

12:15.103 --> 12:15.965
that killed Mike Archer.

12:15.965 --> 12:18.379
We do not put
Wolfsbane in our food.

12:18.379 --> 12:20.344
Well it did get
in here somehow.

12:21.551 --> 12:22.793
Who else
works in here?

12:22.793 --> 12:23.655
On a Tuesday?

12:23.655 --> 12:24.448
Only me.

12:24.448 --> 12:26.448
Who's in charge
of inventory?

12:26.448 --> 12:27.655
Alice.

12:27.655 --> 12:28.482
My dad's wife.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.310
Interesting distinction.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.310
My mother
died years ago.

12:32.310 --> 12:34.275
My dad re-married her.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.172
You two get along?

12:35.172 --> 12:36.724
We get along
well enough.

12:37.241 --> 12:38.172
Right.

12:38.172 --> 12:40.310
I'm going to need a
sample of everything

12:40.310 --> 12:41.482
that goes into
the Royal Stir-fry.

12:41.482 --> 12:43.482
Yeah I've made
it so many times-

12:43.482 --> 12:44.724
I could do it
in my sleep.

12:49.413 --> 12:50.724
Something wrong?

12:51.172 --> 12:53.103
The galangal
paste is missing.

12:53.862 --> 12:54.689
Galangal paste?

12:54.689 --> 12:55.827
What's that?

12:55.827 --> 12:57.172
It's used in
Thai cuisine.

12:57.172 --> 12:58.793
It helps lowers
blood pressure.

12:58.793 --> 13:00.793
Chief Archer and
my dad thought

13:00.793 --> 13:01.758
by making the switch-

13:01.758 --> 13:03.758
he could keep having
his favourite dish.

13:03.758 --> 13:05.793
We've been making it
this way for him for years.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.137
When was the last
time you saw it?

13:08.896 --> 13:09.965
Last night.

13:09.965 --> 13:10.827
After I made
the dish.

13:10.827 --> 13:12.448
It should be here.

13:12.448 --> 13:14.275
You have any security
cameras in the restaurant?

13:14.275 --> 13:16.620
No, my dad says
they're too expensive.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.655
Ah!

13:18.931 --> 13:20.103
Hey, Kenny.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.482
Sorry, we forgot to tell
you we're closed today.

13:22.862 --> 13:23.551
Hi Maple.

13:25.103 --> 13:27.068
Is everything okay?

13:27.862 --> 13:29.413
There was a death in
the restaurant last night.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.241
Oh.

13:32.896 --> 13:33.965
I'm sorry
to hear that.

13:33.965 --> 13:35.068
Um-

13:35.344 --> 13:37.206
I'll just take this stuff
back to the depot then.

13:50.724 --> 13:51.413
Hey hey hey.

13:51.413 --> 13:53.000
Hey what's
your dog after?

13:54.310 --> 13:55.586
Show me your hands.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.137
Roll your sleeve up.

14:10.275 --> 14:11.931
Kenny Constantine.

14:11.931 --> 14:13.896
Did eleven years
for manslaughter.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.793
Eligible for parole
after seven.

14:15.793 --> 14:19.103
Guess who spoke against
him at every hearing.

14:19.103 --> 14:20.172
Chief Archer?

14:20.172 --> 14:21.965
Yeah you got it.

14:21.965 --> 14:25.379
Gives him four years
to dream up a murder.

14:25.379 --> 14:26.413
Plenty of motive.

14:39.344 --> 14:41.137
You want to tell me
what I'm doing in here?

14:41.137 --> 14:44.137
Yeah, breach of
parole, Kenny.

14:44.137 --> 14:45.172
Killing a man-

14:45.172 --> 14:47.482
that's against the
terms of your release.

14:47.482 --> 14:50.206
The only man I killed
was a long time ago.

14:51.448 --> 14:53.206
And I didn't
even mean to.

14:54.482 --> 14:56.862
Guy came after
my best friend.

14:56.862 --> 14:57.586
Things-

14:58.586 --> 14:59.655
got out of hand.

14:59.655 --> 15:01.241
Yeah but you
still killed him.

15:01.241 --> 15:03.344
It was a mistake.

15:03.344 --> 15:05.965
And one I promised
that I'd never repeat.

15:05.965 --> 15:10.068
Kenny Constantine's out of
control anger took the life

15:10.068 --> 15:11.586
of a promising
young man

15:11.586 --> 15:14.206
whose family has been
torn apart by his actions.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.413
That sound
familiar to you?

15:15.413 --> 15:16.172
Yeah.

15:16.172 --> 15:18.310
Too familiar.

15:18.310 --> 15:19.724
That's what
Chief Archer said

15:19.724 --> 15:21.689
every time my parole
hearing came up.

15:22.413 --> 15:24.000
Pretty hard not
to hold a grudge.

15:26.413 --> 15:27.517
Archer's dead?

15:36.241 --> 15:37.241
Yeah.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.896
He wasn't on my
Christmas card list.

15:39.896 --> 15:42.689
But I told myself I
would never do anything

15:42.689 --> 15:44.000
that would put
me back in prison.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.965
You threatened
the chief of police.

15:46.965 --> 15:47.896
I spent four years

15:47.896 --> 15:49.482
thinking of what
I would say to him

15:49.482 --> 15:51.482
if I ever got
the chance.

15:51.482 --> 15:52.517
So when I
ran into him-

15:52.517 --> 15:53.620
outside the bank-

15:53.620 --> 15:54.482
I unloaded on him.

15:56.586 --> 15:57.517
Yeah.

15:57.517 --> 15:59.241
But maybe that
wasn't enough.

15:59.241 --> 16:00.310
You wanted to
make him pay

16:00.310 --> 16:02.275
for the years that he had
taken away from you huh?

16:02.931 --> 16:03.586
You can think

16:03.586 --> 16:04.482
whatever you want, man.

16:06.620 --> 16:07.482
I didn't kill him.

16:09.172 --> 16:10.172
I didn't kill him.

16:21.482 --> 16:22.793
Results just came back
on the food samples

16:22.793 --> 16:23.655
we took from
Good Taste.

16:24.724 --> 16:26.206
None of the other
ingredients contained aconite.

16:26.206 --> 16:28.137
So the source has to
be in the missing paste.

16:28.137 --> 16:29.862
Can you get
me a sample

16:29.862 --> 16:31.482
of aconite that I
can train Rex on?

16:31.482 --> 16:32.413
Well unfortunately-

16:32.413 --> 16:33.931
aconite is known
for its lack of scent.

16:33.931 --> 16:34.896
So I don't think

16:34.896 --> 16:36.655
Rex is going to be
able to detect it.

16:40.551 --> 16:41.758
Don't say that
in front of him.

16:45.896 --> 16:47.689
Is this the galangal
paste you use?

16:47.896 --> 16:49.482
No we don't use
that cheap stuff.

16:49.482 --> 16:50.379
Oh.

16:50.379 --> 16:51.965
That came from
a favourite store.

16:51.965 --> 16:55.724
Hey you still have
Kenny in custody?

16:55.724 --> 16:56.793
Yeah, for now.

16:57.586 --> 17:00.896
Well, he
didn't do it.

17:00.896 --> 17:01.551
He wouldn't have.

17:01.551 --> 17:02.724
Yeah, Peter.

17:02.724 --> 17:04.862
Look I appreciate that you
see the best in people, but-

17:04.862 --> 17:08.241
Kenny worked
hard to change.

17:08.241 --> 17:09.586
He was taking
courses, training-

17:09.586 --> 17:11.034
anger management-

17:11.034 --> 17:12.689
all while he
was in jail.

17:12.689 --> 17:13.827
How do you
know all this?

17:13.827 --> 17:15.793
Mike told me.

17:16.689 --> 17:18.827
He heard it from
the prison warden.

17:18.827 --> 17:23.000
Mike was so happy that Kenny
was turning his life around-

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
he even supported his
bid for parole last year.

17:27.275 --> 17:28.000
Alice and I-

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
helped him
get his job.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.482
Did Kenny
know about this?

17:31.482 --> 17:32.482
Of course he did!

17:32.482 --> 17:34.275
That's why I know he
would never do anything

17:34.275 --> 17:37.655
to bring shame to
me or my restaurant.

17:37.655 --> 17:39.000
He's loyal.

17:40.034 --> 17:40.689
We'll see.

17:42.137 --> 17:43.000
Okay.

17:43.206 --> 17:44.206
Ready?

17:44.965 --> 17:45.620
Get the scent.

17:47.000 --> 17:47.827
Track it.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.241
It's not better.

18:27.862 --> 18:28.965
Hey, buddy!

18:28.965 --> 18:29.793
Where'd you come from?

18:31.620 --> 18:32.275
Uh, you.

18:32.275 --> 18:32.965
Uh-huh?

18:32.965 --> 18:34.206
Is that your dog?

18:34.206 --> 18:35.448
No, he's my partner.

18:53.000 --> 18:53.827
Yeah.

19:06.551 --> 19:08.172
This come
from your kitchen?

19:08.172 --> 19:08.931
Bill!

19:09.413 --> 19:10.241
I should have known

19:10.241 --> 19:11.310
it was you!

19:11.310 --> 19:12.689
Is that what
you do now, Bill?

19:12.689 --> 19:14.172
Kill my customer?

19:14.172 --> 19:14.896
Huh?

19:18.965 --> 19:19.620
Aghh!

19:19.620 --> 19:20.758
What are you doing?

19:20.758 --> 19:21.448
Calm down!

19:21.448 --> 19:23.275
Arrest him!

19:23.275 --> 19:24.275
It's Bill!

19:24.275 --> 19:26.000
Bill's been trying
to ruin me for months!

19:26.827 --> 19:27.965
Come on!

19:43.034 --> 19:43.724
Liam!

19:44.068 --> 19:45.000
Liam!

19:45.689 --> 19:46.896
Where you
involved in this?

19:46.896 --> 19:47.931
In what?

19:47.931 --> 19:49.137
Poisoning our best customer!

19:49.137 --> 19:51.862
Are you seriously pointing
fingers at me?

19:51.862 --> 19:53.413
After everything that's
happened at Better Taste?

20:04.379 --> 20:05.448
Are you okay?

20:06.034 --> 20:07.000
Mmmm.

20:08.482 --> 20:10.137
How do you know
these people?

20:10.137 --> 20:12.000
There's clearly history here.

20:12.758 --> 20:13.965
I practically grew
up with Liam.

20:15.034 --> 20:16.655
Our dads started
Good Taste together.

20:18.206 --> 20:20.034
But the partnership ended?

20:20.965 --> 20:22.172
It's no surprise.

20:23.827 --> 20:26.275
A lot of ego
in this business.

20:26.275 --> 20:27.482
Mm-hmm.

20:27.482 --> 20:30.862
But then Bill started
Better Taste across the street-

20:30.862 --> 20:33.517
with a nearly
identical menu.

20:33.517 --> 20:35.413
They even have their
own Royal Stir-fry.

20:36.448 --> 20:38.482
Did that hurt
your business?

20:38.482 --> 20:40.413
No one is happy.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.965
My dad and Bill used
to be best friends.

20:41.965 --> 20:43.379
And now they're just
at each other's throats.

20:44.379 --> 20:45.275
Just those two?

20:45.275 --> 20:47.275
Because it sounded
like you were just

20:47.275 --> 20:49.413
accusing Liam of
being part of the feud.

20:50.965 --> 20:52.482
I didn't think
he was.

20:52.482 --> 20:54.379
But maybe my
dad was right.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.482
I should stay
well away.

20:57.655 --> 21:00.275
How serious
is this rift?

21:00.275 --> 21:02.827
Is it possible that the
Chief's death is related?

21:04.172 --> 21:06.000
It was just resentment
and competition at first.

21:07.517 --> 21:09.000
But it was
never dangerous.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.103
Any news Charlie?

21:15.103 --> 21:16.103
Yeah according to Maple-

21:16.103 --> 21:17.586
Peter and Bill
have been battling

21:17.586 --> 21:18.689
since their partnership ended.

21:18.689 --> 21:20.172
Opening Better Taste
across the street

21:20.172 --> 21:21.413
was just asking
for trouble.

21:21.413 --> 21:23.310
Yeah, maybe things
just got out of hand.

21:23.310 --> 21:24.896
So why target
Mike Archer?

21:24.896 --> 21:26.655
Death of a high
profile customer

21:26.655 --> 21:27.517
could ruin Good
Taste's business.

21:27.517 --> 21:29.379
So Mike Archer

21:29.379 --> 21:30.793
is just a pawn in
this whole feud?

21:30.793 --> 21:31.758
Uh, I don't know.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.068
It's just a theory.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.689
Everything okay?

21:41.965 --> 21:42.620
Yeah yeah.

21:42.620 --> 21:43.862
I just-

21:43.862 --> 21:45.724
I think Mike's death is hitting
me harder than I expected.

21:45.724 --> 21:48.689
Yeah, you two were
rookies together, right?

21:48.689 --> 21:49.586
Yeah, we were
close friends

21:49.586 --> 21:50.241
for a while there.

21:50.241 --> 21:51.000
Mmm.

21:51.000 --> 21:52.137
What changed?

21:52.137 --> 21:53.310
Well you know
this Charlie.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.551
When you're
a rookie-

21:54.551 --> 21:55.551
you realize that
this career

21:55.551 --> 21:56.793
requires a lot
of sacrifice.

21:56.793 --> 21:57.862
Mmm.

21:57.862 --> 21:59.275
I was in a relationship
at the time.

21:59.275 --> 22:00.620
And uh-

22:01.448 --> 22:03.206
I loved the
job more I think.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.379
And-?

22:05.379 --> 22:07.586
And-

22:07.586 --> 22:09.241
Mike was
there for her.

22:10.517 --> 22:11.241
Rebecca?

22:12.551 --> 22:13.482
Wait a second.

22:13.482 --> 22:15.413
You and the
Chief's wife?

22:18.448 --> 22:19.482
I shouldn't
have blamed him.

22:21.655 --> 22:22.965
But I was hurt
at the time.

22:22.965 --> 22:25.344
Things were never the
same between you two.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.137
Even after twenty years?

22:28.137 --> 22:30.413
I just wish Mike and I
had settled things

22:30.413 --> 22:31.586
while we still
had time.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.896
He was
a good man.

22:36.068 --> 22:38.172
A great friend.

22:38.172 --> 22:38.896
Yeah.

22:38.896 --> 22:40.103
Right?

22:51.068 --> 22:52.172
Oh hey
hey hey look!

22:52.172 --> 22:53.931
Now if this is
about the lights-

22:53.931 --> 22:55.793
or the flash mob
or the fake eggs-

22:55.793 --> 22:56.448
Listen.

22:56.448 --> 22:57.551
I will come clean.

22:57.551 --> 23:00.517
But I had nothing to do
with Chief Archer's death.

23:03.862 --> 23:04.517
Oh!

23:04.517 --> 23:05.689
Yeah.

23:05.965 --> 23:07.137
Sure.

23:08.206 --> 23:11.241
So you admit to antagonizing
Peter Wong and his business?

23:11.241 --> 23:12.689
Our business.

23:12.689 --> 23:13.862
We started it together.

23:13.862 --> 23:15.068
And listen.

23:15.068 --> 23:16.827
Peter can give
as good as he gets.

23:17.448 --> 23:18.103
Really?

23:18.103 --> 23:18.793
Yeah.

23:18.793 --> 23:20.413
Last winter- okay?

23:20.413 --> 23:22.344
He froze our delivery
van to the sidewalk.

23:24.137 --> 23:26.137
We had to use a
blowtorch to thaw it out.

23:26.137 --> 23:27.379
That didn't
make you mad?

23:27.379 --> 23:28.068
Well-

23:28.068 --> 23:29.034
yeah.

23:29.034 --> 23:29.827
But you know-

23:29.827 --> 23:31.517
I mean, it wasn't
a bad stunt.

23:31.517 --> 23:33.379
I mean it was pretty
funny actually.

23:33.379 --> 23:34.517
Hmmm.

23:35.034 --> 23:37.172
Hey, tell me about your
online delivery system.

23:38.689 --> 23:40.758
I never wanted
that thing okay?

23:40.758 --> 23:41.724
That was Liam's idea.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.689
Yeah, all items
on your menu-

23:43.689 --> 23:44.724
they were priced
at a dollar.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.758
Must have lost
a lot of money!

23:46.758 --> 23:50.206
Yeah, and didn't discover it
until the end of the night.

23:50.206 --> 23:51.034
Stupid app.

23:51.034 --> 23:52.103
And Peter
was behind it?

23:52.103 --> 23:53.896
Well who else
could it be?

23:53.896 --> 23:54.655
I just-

23:54.655 --> 23:56.241
I don't know
how they did it!

23:56.241 --> 23:57.620
So you needed to
get back at him.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.931
And you targeted his
favourite customer?

23:59.931 --> 24:01.551
Oh.

24:01.551 --> 24:02.724
Look.

24:03.586 --> 24:07.413
If I wanted to use Chief
Archer to get back at Peter-

24:07.413 --> 24:08.896
I would steal him
as a customer-

24:08.896 --> 24:10.068
not poison him!

24:10.068 --> 24:11.862
Maybe you didn't
mean to kill him.

24:11.862 --> 24:14.344
You were just trying
to make him sick?

24:14.344 --> 24:15.275
Ruin Peter's reputation?

24:15.275 --> 24:16.896
Well how could
I even do that?

24:16.896 --> 24:19.586
The closest I could get to
Good Taste is the sidewalk!

24:19.586 --> 24:20.758
Huh.

24:21.896 --> 24:23.172
Look.

24:23.758 --> 24:26.000
Um- I'm sorry Detective.

24:26.000 --> 24:26.965
But um-

24:26.965 --> 24:28.034
I just-

24:28.965 --> 24:30.310
I think you're barking
up the wrong tree.

24:33.310 --> 24:34.896
We don't have
enough to hold him.

24:34.896 --> 24:37.965
The jar was found in the garbage
outside of the Better Taste.

24:37.965 --> 24:39.896
Anyone could
have planted that.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.034
Maybe I can tell you
who that anyone is.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.379
Why- what
have you got?

24:43.379 --> 24:44.862
Okay, the local food
blog Chewfoundland

24:44.862 --> 24:46.137
has been covering
the rivalry

24:46.137 --> 24:47.379
ever since Wong-
Morrison split.

24:47.379 --> 24:50.793
I mean he's got articles of
every battle in the prank war

24:50.793 --> 24:52.103
between Good
and Better Taste.

24:52.103 --> 24:52.793
I mean look.

24:52.793 --> 24:54.517
Judging by these comments-

24:54.517 --> 24:55.379
people are
really into this.

24:55.379 --> 24:57.241
Okay so the
whole city knows

24:57.482 --> 24:58.655
that Peter and Bill
hate each other?

24:58.655 --> 24:59.931
Oh yes, but
that's not all.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.206
Take a look
at this.

25:04.137 --> 25:05.000
Yeah
well that's the-

25:05.000 --> 25:07.103
dining room of
the Good Taste.

25:07.103 --> 25:09.448
Yeah I mean
at first glance-

25:09.448 --> 25:11.620
it looked like
a customer photo.

25:11.620 --> 25:13.827
But there's way too much
noise going on in this image.

25:13.827 --> 25:15.551
Meaning what?

25:15.551 --> 25:17.137
Well it's an image
from CCTV.

25:17.137 --> 25:19.413
Maple said that they don't
have CCTV in the restaurant.

25:19.413 --> 25:20.413
They don't.

25:20.413 --> 25:22.172
But the food blogger
placed secret cameras

25:22.172 --> 25:23.689
inside both restaurants.

25:23.689 --> 25:28.620
Which would mean that they would
have video evidence of um-

25:28.620 --> 25:30.724
what happened in the
restaurant last night?

25:30.724 --> 25:31.758
Oh yes.

25:31.758 --> 25:33.758
See, I was chatting
with the creator

25:33.758 --> 25:34.862
of Chewfoundland.

25:34.862 --> 25:37.000
And I'm downloading all
of his footage right now.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.655
If something sneaky happened
at that restaurant yesterday-

25:40.655 --> 25:41.724
it's going to
be on here.

25:42.758 --> 25:43.551
And um-

25:43.551 --> 25:46.965
Sorry- he agreed
to hand it over?

25:46.965 --> 25:47.689
All of it?

25:47.689 --> 25:48.931
Yeah yeah,
all of it.

25:48.931 --> 25:50.241
Every single thing.

25:50.241 --> 25:51.620
I mean I did
impress on him

25:51.620 --> 25:54.137
that filming someone
without their consent

25:54.137 --> 25:55.724
is practically illegal.

25:55.724 --> 25:56.862
Mm-hmm.

26:00.206 --> 26:02.000
Oh, download complete!

26:04.344 --> 26:05.379
Huh.

26:09.310 --> 26:11.793
Ugh- it's just an
empty restaurant.

26:11.793 --> 26:13.034
Well yeah.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.413
But that's from the morning
of the day that Archer died-

26:14.413 --> 26:15.206
before they opened.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.655
Let me see if I
can scrub forward.

26:16.655 --> 26:17.965
Sure you want
to do that?

26:17.965 --> 26:19.241
Because the
image is grainy.

26:19.241 --> 26:20.034
No no no.

26:20.034 --> 26:20.965
I think
I got it.

26:24.103 --> 26:25.655
Well hello there!

26:37.620 --> 26:38.482
Wait Jesse.

26:38.482 --> 26:39.206
Rewind and pause that.

26:39.206 --> 26:40.103
Yeah.

26:43.517 --> 26:44.586
Huh.

26:44.586 --> 26:45.965
Who is that?

26:45.965 --> 26:47.068
Liam Morrison.

26:47.068 --> 26:47.793
Bill's son.

26:48.482 --> 26:49.206
Come on pal.

26:49.724 --> 26:50.482
Rex.

27:54.655 --> 27:55.793
Liam?

27:56.482 --> 27:57.310
Step back.

27:57.310 --> 27:58.103
It's okay!

28:01.344 --> 28:02.172
Turn around.

28:02.172 --> 28:03.517
It's okay.

28:04.655 --> 28:05.379
Uh-

28:07.344 --> 28:08.758
Maple are you okay?

28:09.586 --> 28:10.413
It's not what
you think.

28:29.758 --> 28:30.517
I thought Maple

28:30.517 --> 28:31.620
must have
been in trouble

28:31.620 --> 28:33.482
because of how heated
you two were earlier.

28:33.482 --> 28:36.793
I just apologized
for that.

28:36.793 --> 28:39.310
I was right
about Liam-

28:39.310 --> 28:40.655
Detective.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.689
Neither of us want this rivalry
between our dads to escalate.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.655
So what were you doing
in the restaurant

28:46.655 --> 28:48.344
the day that Mike Archer
was murdered, Liam?

28:49.137 --> 28:50.551
I came to
see Maple.

28:51.379 --> 28:53.172
We've
been dating

28:53.172 --> 28:54.827
for over
a year now.

28:56.241 --> 28:58.724
So neither of your parents know
that you two are together?

28:59.931 --> 29:02.275
It's better this way.

29:02.275 --> 29:06.241
We were waiting until we
had a business plan in hand.

29:06.241 --> 29:07.931
A business plan?

29:07.931 --> 29:09.482
We crunched
the numbers.

29:09.482 --> 29:10.655
The restaurants

29:10.655 --> 29:11.827
would be way more
profitable together

29:11.827 --> 29:12.689
than they are apart.

29:14.137 --> 29:15.344
We want to
work together.

29:15.344 --> 29:18.931
Trust us, Detective.

29:18.931 --> 29:20.827
We just want our dads
to be friends again.

29:31.862 --> 29:32.517
Hey.

29:32.517 --> 29:33.275
Hey.

29:34.896 --> 29:37.482
Think you'll give
it a rest soon?

29:37.482 --> 29:38.689
Ah, I can't.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.034
Joe's counting on
me for this one.

29:40.034 --> 29:41.862
So I don't
think so.

29:43.241 --> 29:44.137
Okay.

29:45.448 --> 29:46.862
Let's run it.

29:48.034 --> 29:48.689
Really?

29:48.689 --> 29:49.517
Yeah let's do it.

29:49.517 --> 29:50.586
Come on.

29:50.586 --> 29:51.965
Ah-

29:51.965 --> 29:54.827
Well, start
with the obvious.

29:54.827 --> 29:55.827
What do we know?

29:55.827 --> 29:57.551
Mike Archer was
killed by aconite

29:57.551 --> 29:59.689
from the galangal
paste jar.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.965
Paste that was delivered
to the restaurant

30:01.965 --> 30:02.896
by Kenny Constantine.

30:02.896 --> 30:04.344
Now, he would
have known

30:04.344 --> 30:05.275
the Chief was
a regular-

30:05.275 --> 30:06.310
and what he ordered.

30:07.344 --> 30:09.241
Yeah but Peter
Wong swears

30:09.241 --> 30:11.000
Kenny had nothing
to do with this.

30:18.896 --> 30:20.862
Then there's Maple Wong.

30:20.862 --> 30:22.172
She made the dinner
that killed Archer.

30:22.172 --> 30:24.103
But I don't know
what her motive is.

30:24.103 --> 30:26.137
Wouldn't be good
for the restaurant.

30:27.413 --> 30:28.965
What about-

30:28.965 --> 30:29.862
Noel-

30:29.862 --> 30:31.103
Noel Cameron?

30:31.103 --> 30:33.482
Yeah he's all bark.

30:34.310 --> 30:35.724
No bite.

30:40.793 --> 30:43.586
Well, I looked
into Bill and Liam.

30:43.586 --> 30:44.689
Yeah.

30:44.689 --> 30:46.758
Their restaurant is doing
really well actually.

30:46.758 --> 30:48.862
Possibly better
than Good Taste.

30:49.758 --> 30:50.827
Hmm.

30:52.137 --> 30:54.137
I think we'll just
hang on to them-

30:54.137 --> 30:55.620
just for a
minute pal.

31:01.448 --> 31:03.206
So that leaves us
with the Wongs.

31:03.206 --> 31:06.413
The family that cooks
together kills together?

31:08.068 --> 31:10.000
Something like that.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.413
I'd feel better if I there
was a motive with them.

31:17.965 --> 31:19.103
Hey.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.896
Let's tell people
about us.

31:26.655 --> 31:28.000
What do you think?

31:30.137 --> 31:32.241
I mean we did just
have a close call.

31:34.137 --> 31:36.655
And I really think people
should hear about it from us.

31:41.034 --> 31:42.379
Maybe we have
nothing to worry about.

31:54.517 --> 31:55.241
Hey.

31:56.275 --> 31:57.068
Vanessa!

31:57.068 --> 31:57.965
Thanks.

31:58.551 --> 32:00.586
Oh hey!

32:00.586 --> 32:01.965
News?

32:01.965 --> 32:03.275
Yeah!

32:03.275 --> 32:06.758
The president
of the SJPD board

32:06.758 --> 32:09.586
asked if I'd be open to
the interim chief position.

32:11.241 --> 32:12.034
Really?

32:12.034 --> 32:14.172
Yeah, no hard feelings?

32:14.172 --> 32:15.000
Right?

32:15.724 --> 32:16.724
No.

32:18.241 --> 32:19.620
No, none at all.

32:21.758 --> 32:23.758
Because he asked me
the same damn thing.

32:25.241 --> 32:25.896
Okay.

32:26.896 --> 32:28.551
Just when I thought
I had one up on you.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.103
How's the
investigation going?

32:35.310 --> 32:38.172
I spent the morning reading
death threats against Mike.

32:39.586 --> 32:40.758
You know
how it is.

32:40.758 --> 32:42.586
The higher you go-

32:42.586 --> 32:44.724
the bigger the
target on your back.

32:46.448 --> 32:48.379
Vanessa do you ever
wonder sometimes

32:48.379 --> 32:50.000
whether it's all
even worth it?

32:53.413 --> 32:54.896
Come on now, Joe.

32:56.620 --> 32:58.586
We don't scare
that easily.

33:10.931 --> 33:12.275
Charlie.

33:12.275 --> 33:13.517
You find something
on the Wongs?

33:13.517 --> 33:17.448
Oh baby, I've got a hot and
spicy plate of motive baby.

33:17.448 --> 33:18.551
Take a look
at this.

33:18.551 --> 33:21.310
Jesse I do not have
time to read all this.

33:21.310 --> 33:22.931
Okay so Good Taste
took out insurance

33:22.931 --> 33:23.689
covering
acts of malice

33:23.689 --> 33:24.482
and vandalism.

33:24.482 --> 33:25.241
Mm-hmm?

33:25.241 --> 33:26.172
You're saying that-

33:26.172 --> 33:27.551
if we can prove that
Chief Archer's death

33:27.551 --> 33:28.586
was an act
of malice-

33:28.586 --> 33:30.068
They'd have a claim.

33:30.068 --> 33:31.068
What's the policy worth?

33:31.068 --> 33:32.068
Well if the
restaurant closes

33:32.068 --> 33:34.241
as a result of Chief
Archer's death-

33:34.241 --> 33:35.275
three million.

33:37.241 --> 33:38.793
Who took out
the policy?

33:38.793 --> 33:39.724
Alice Wong.

33:54.137 --> 33:55.068
Come on!

33:55.068 --> 33:56.620
I think you're making
a huge mistake here.

33:56.620 --> 33:57.620
You should be
cashing out-

33:57.620 --> 34:00.206
and finally retiring!

34:00.206 --> 34:02.931
Since when are you so
invested in this place?

34:07.172 --> 34:07.931
Oh!

34:07.931 --> 34:09.172
Detective!

34:09.172 --> 34:10.379
What can I
do for you?

34:10.379 --> 34:13.206
Am I interrupting anything?

34:13.206 --> 34:15.827
Oh, no.

34:15.827 --> 34:17.862
I was just breaking
the news to Kurt.

34:17.862 --> 34:20.793
Peter and I are
helping Maple and Liam

34:20.793 --> 34:21.896
to take over
the restaurant.

34:23.965 --> 34:25.862
They told you
their secret?

34:25.862 --> 34:27.793
We're so
happy for them.

34:27.793 --> 34:30.689
You really think those
two lovebirds are ready

34:30.689 --> 34:31.620
to take this
restaurant over?

34:31.620 --> 34:33.827
You'll wind up
having to come in

34:33.827 --> 34:35.689
and keep working your fingers
to the bone like you always-

34:35.689 --> 34:36.413
Shhh.

34:36.413 --> 34:38.448
Kurt, please.

34:39.206 --> 34:39.931
Mrs. Wong.

34:40.275 --> 34:41.068
Yes.

34:41.068 --> 34:41.862
Can
you tell me

34:41.862 --> 34:44.241
about the restaurant's
insurance?

34:45.137 --> 34:46.862
Standard stuff, I think.

34:46.862 --> 34:48.724
No no.

34:48.724 --> 34:52.379
You have special coverage for
acts of vandalism and malice.

34:52.379 --> 34:53.206
Why is that?

34:53.206 --> 34:54.241
Oh!

34:54.241 --> 34:55.413
Uh-

34:55.413 --> 34:56.413
Kurt suggested that

34:56.413 --> 34:58.517
after a rash of broken
windows in the area

34:58.517 --> 35:00.034
earlier this year.

35:00.034 --> 35:02.172
He has the head
for business.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.655
Really?

35:05.655 --> 35:06.517
That's interesting.

35:06.517 --> 35:09.206
Uh- do you
know that

35:09.206 --> 35:12.551
if the Chief's death were to
shut this restaurant down-

35:12.551 --> 35:15.206
that policy would be worth
up to three million dollars.

35:16.620 --> 35:17.344
Oh!

35:18.241 --> 35:19.206
Oh my.

35:19.206 --> 35:21.137
See, Mom?

35:21.137 --> 35:22.724
This is what
I'm talking about!

35:25.344 --> 35:27.137
That is a new
life for you-

35:27.137 --> 35:29.000
away from this place!

35:40.000 --> 35:42.655
Hey man, you want to
tell your dog to lay off?

35:43.689 --> 35:45.172
Detective?

35:45.172 --> 35:45.931
Mrs. Wong.

35:45.931 --> 35:46.862
Stay right
where you are.

35:46.862 --> 35:47.827
Kurt.

35:47.827 --> 35:49.620
There's something
on your jacket.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.103
Nope.

35:52.724 --> 35:54.206
Let the detective
see your jacket!

35:54.206 --> 35:55.517
Mom.

36:04.896 --> 36:05.586
Kurt!

36:07.586 --> 36:08.448
Kurt!

36:08.655 --> 36:09.724
Come on kid.

36:09.965 --> 36:11.896
We're going in to the
station peacefully okay?

36:15.827 --> 36:17.413
Back off, mutt!

37:09.344 --> 37:10.172
Mom, just-

37:45.965 --> 37:46.689
Aghhh!

38:00.896 --> 38:01.620
Ughh!

38:16.758 --> 38:17.793
Good job buddy.

38:23.724 --> 38:24.862
The black sheep.

38:24.862 --> 38:26.206
What did you have
against the Chief?

38:26.206 --> 38:27.413
Nothing.

38:27.413 --> 38:29.137
I owed money.

38:29.793 --> 38:31.758
The crypto crash
pretty much broke me.

38:31.758 --> 38:33.068
I borrowed
money to get in.

38:33.068 --> 38:34.034
And I
lost it all.

38:34.034 --> 38:35.103
Turn around.

38:35.586 --> 38:36.344
How much
did you owe?

38:36.344 --> 38:37.517
A hundred K.

38:37.517 --> 38:39.413
I asked for
more time.

38:39.413 --> 38:40.172
They said no.

38:40.172 --> 38:41.310
And the guys
that I owed

38:41.310 --> 38:43.172
knew that Archer ate at my
mom's place every Tuesday.

38:43.172 --> 38:43.896
I get it.

38:43.896 --> 38:44.586
So-

38:44.586 --> 38:46.137
you kill Archer-

38:46.137 --> 38:46.931
your debt goes away.

38:46.931 --> 38:48.103
Hmm?

38:48.103 --> 38:51.379
Peter made my mom put her
whole life into this place.

38:51.379 --> 38:52.758
It made me sick!

38:52.758 --> 38:53.517
I figured-

38:53.517 --> 38:55.172
two birds, one stone.

38:55.172 --> 38:56.586
You really convinced yourself.

38:56.586 --> 38:57.379
Didn't you?

38:57.379 --> 38:59.344
Kill a good man-

38:59.344 --> 39:00.965
instead of coming
to the police?

39:02.551 --> 39:03.448
We could have
helped you.

39:03.448 --> 39:05.344
The debt just became
too much, man.

39:05.344 --> 39:06.275
Okay?

39:06.275 --> 39:08.758
I owed so much
that I was desperate.

39:09.551 --> 39:11.206
Get in the cell.

39:17.241 --> 39:18.103
Look.

39:25.206 --> 39:25.931
Oh!

39:25.931 --> 39:26.896
There you are.

39:26.896 --> 39:28.931
I heard your team
caught Mike's killer!

39:29.586 --> 39:31.103
Well you
know, I guess-

39:31.103 --> 39:32.172
if my
squad had a K9-

39:32.172 --> 39:33.551
I'd be the Chief!

39:34.448 --> 39:36.103
Well actually,
it's interim chief.

39:36.103 --> 39:37.517
You know, it's
still up in the air

39:37.517 --> 39:39.000
who gets the permanent
assignment you know?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.965
If I screw up-

39:40.965 --> 39:41.931
Oh come on.

39:41.931 --> 39:43.275
You're not the
type to screw up.

39:44.827 --> 39:45.965
Congratulations.

39:45.965 --> 39:46.724
Thank you.

39:47.620 --> 39:48.931
You know, drinks
are on me now.

39:48.931 --> 39:50.275
Oh okay!

39:51.344 --> 39:52.586
Unless uh-

39:52.586 --> 39:54.586
you need to
comfort the widow.

39:55.551 --> 39:56.551
Excuse me?

39:57.931 --> 39:59.241
Yeah I mean,
you know-

39:59.241 --> 40:01.000
I heard you two
have history.

40:02.551 --> 40:03.931
Uh look, she's-

40:03.931 --> 40:05.586
I mean, she's
an old friend.

40:06.689 --> 40:07.793
And her husband
just died.

40:12.724 --> 40:13.413
You know what?

40:13.413 --> 40:14.206
Um-

40:14.862 --> 40:15.931
I think it might
be better-

40:15.931 --> 40:17.827
if we do take
that rain cheque.

40:18.827 --> 40:22.758
Yeah, except I don't
do rain cheques.

40:22.758 --> 40:25.275
And I certainly don't
do ex-girlfriends.

40:33.206 --> 40:34.344
Hey Joe.

40:35.344 --> 40:36.965
Hey.

40:36.965 --> 40:38.517
You made an arrest?

40:38.517 --> 40:39.793
Yes.

40:39.793 --> 40:41.931
Yes, and we
got a confession.

40:41.931 --> 40:43.448
So hopefully
he pleads out.

40:43.448 --> 40:45.068
And that'll spare you-

40:45.068 --> 40:46.689
a trial.

40:52.448 --> 40:53.275
Thank you.

40:53.275 --> 40:55.000
Of course.

41:05.413 --> 41:06.586
That smells good.

41:06.586 --> 41:08.448
Maple gave
me the recipe.

41:09.862 --> 41:11.448
We're definitely
telling them, right?

41:11.448 --> 41:12.793
No turning back now.

41:12.793 --> 41:13.758
So you're kidding me.

41:13.758 --> 41:15.655
So she actually said
no rain cheques?

41:16.379 --> 41:17.241
Yeah.

41:17.241 --> 41:18.517
Yeah that's exactly
what she said.

41:18.517 --> 41:20.241
I thought I was king
of the rookie moves.

41:21.379 --> 41:22.448
Mmm!

41:22.448 --> 41:24.137
Charlie, so the
restaurant feud

41:24.137 --> 41:25.103
is over, right?

41:25.103 --> 41:27.241
Liam and Maple are
running the show?

41:27.241 --> 41:29.034
Yeah, Good Taste
and Better Taste

41:29.034 --> 41:30.827
are coming together
once again.

41:30.827 --> 41:32.931
Oh I just came up with a
name for their restaurant.

41:32.931 --> 41:33.620
Want to hear it?

41:33.620 --> 41:34.344
What?

41:34.344 --> 41:35.482
Best Taste.

41:35.482 --> 41:36.344
That's what they
should call

41:36.344 --> 41:37.206
the name of
the restaurant.

41:37.206 --> 41:37.896
Best Taste.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.379
Mmm- no.

41:39.379 --> 41:40.655
That's the
best you got?

41:40.655 --> 41:41.344
Okay.

41:42.793 --> 41:45.448
Okay this just needs to
sit a couple of minutes.

41:45.448 --> 41:46.551
Oh do you mind?

41:46.551 --> 41:47.551
No, go ahead!

41:48.379 --> 41:49.724
Mmm!

41:50.827 --> 41:51.689
Oh wait.

41:51.689 --> 41:52.724
There's no galangal
in this is there?

41:52.724 --> 41:54.448
Oh it's a secret ingredient.

41:58.689 --> 41:59.620
Mmm!

42:01.206 --> 42:02.103
Mmm!

42:03.620 --> 42:04.965
Okay so, I asked
you guys here

42:04.965 --> 42:07.034
because I have some
personal news to share.

42:09.310 --> 42:11.551
Uh-

42:14.379 --> 42:16.517
Sarah and I
are dating!

42:19.689 --> 42:21.724
Yeah, we wanted to
tell you at first.

42:21.724 --> 42:22.689
But um-

42:23.655 --> 42:25.655
Charlie and Sarah: Uhhh-

42:26.448 --> 42:27.482
I don't know!

42:27.482 --> 42:30.068
We didn't.

42:30.068 --> 42:31.103
So-

42:31.103 --> 42:33.689
Well first, um-

42:35.482 --> 42:36.551
We're cops.

42:38.137 --> 42:39.482
So we saw this
coming a mile away.

42:41.586 --> 42:42.965
What?

42:42.965 --> 42:44.344
How long have
you known?

42:44.344 --> 42:45.448
I mean, come on.

42:45.448 --> 42:46.931
You thought you could
hide it for an entire year?

42:46.931 --> 42:47.586
That's cute.

42:47.586 --> 42:48.344
Come on.

42:48.344 --> 42:49.137
It's in the eyes.

42:53.206 --> 42:54.206
And also-

42:54.206 --> 42:57.758
I saw you guys on the
restaurant CCTV, so-

42:57.758 --> 42:59.103
Yeah.

42:59.103 --> 43:00.517
You should really work on
your undercover skills there.

43:00.517 --> 43:01.827
Yeah, maybe
take an acting class!

43:08.241 --> 43:09.689
Well I'm glad
it was a secret!
