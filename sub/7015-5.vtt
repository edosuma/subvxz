00:22.840 --> 00:25.965
doesn't anybody want
to ask me how I'm feeling?

00:26.012 --> 00:27.584
Well, of course.

00:27.772 --> 00:30.198
Eric, ask your mother
how she's feeling.

00:30.853 --> 00:32.381
How are you feeling, mom?

00:32.415 --> 00:34.498
Unneeded, unnecessary
and unloved.

00:34.532 --> 00:36.430
Oh, you set me up.

00:37.119 --> 00:39.437
Well, there's no one
for me to take care of.

00:39.487 --> 00:41.906
Steven's off with his dad,
you're...

00:41.940 --> 00:44.930
busy with your silly
not-working projects, and...

00:44.963 --> 00:47.332
we haven't heard from laurie
since she moved to canada.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.787
Where bottomless
dancing is legal.

00:49.811 --> 00:52.570
Cheer up, kitty. You'll always
have me to take care of.

00:52.623 --> 00:55.894
Oh, the way you eat,
you'll be dead long before me.

00:57.050 --> 00:59.900
- You're the one that puts bacon on everything.
- I do not.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.917
- Last week you put bacon on ham.
- Fine.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.150
Everything's my fault.

01:05.300 --> 01:07.567
Man, I can't wait
to be married.

01:07.684 --> 01:10.400
All right, fine.
Look, we could talk all day,

01:10.434 --> 01:16.201
but I see one little fella that
still needs your attention.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.534
We still have schotzie?

01:19.975 --> 01:21.508
I thought he ran away.

01:21.542 --> 01:24.409
No, he's been hiding
underneath the house.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.242
For a year?

01:26.525 --> 01:29.892
Poor little fella.
He's afraid of the garden hose.

01:32.389 --> 01:37.389
Look, mom, maybe you should stop worrying about
everyone else so much and start thinking about yourself.

01:37.423 --> 01:40.156
Maybe you should find something
to enrich your life.

01:40.239 --> 01:41.789
Oh, may I suggest

01:41.839 --> 01:44.172
the teachings of the jedi?

01:45.922 --> 01:49.906
And may I suggest
the footing of your ass?

01:52.840 --> 01:55.573
this is not the ass
you're looking for.

01:57.773 --> 02:00.073
See, now you don't know
what to do.

02:04.399 --> 02:08.666
You guys, yesterday at the salon
I gave a shampoo to tina simpson.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.232
And you know what?

02:10.299 --> 02:12.616
She has a lumpy head.

02:13.949 --> 02:17.266
Oh, gross. I made out with her
in the tenth grade.

02:17.299 --> 02:21.013
If I'd have known she had a lumpy head,
I would have felt around up there.

02:22.046 --> 02:25.030
Well, I mean, it's gross,
but you want to feel it, right?

02:25.213 --> 02:28.230
You guys, listen to this ad.
"Do you like to draw?"

02:28.363 --> 02:32.879
Well, I have been known to trace my
hand and turn it into a turkey.

02:33.013 --> 02:39.313
"If so, have your artistic ability evaluated
"by the cartoon academy of fort lauderdale."

02:39.346 --> 02:42.113
Ooh. I think picasso
went there.

02:42.798 --> 02:47.598
All I have to do is send in my
drawing of sanchez the turtle

02:47.914 --> 02:53.681
and a money order for $19.95. 20 bucks to
get judged by a panel of cartoon experts?

02:53.742 --> 02:55.892
I'd pay twice that.

02:57.109 --> 03:00.876
Steven, you cannot go to your first day
at your dad's company dressed like that.

03:00.925 --> 03:04.809
You're working there,
not digging a ditch to there.

03:05.409 --> 03:07.932
Jackie, he owns a chain
of record stores.

03:07.965 --> 03:10.732
This is the official uniform
of rock 'n' roll.

03:10.782 --> 03:12.732
I'm dressed to jam.

03:13.265 --> 03:16.382
I agree with jackie.
You clean up so nice.

03:16.965 --> 03:19.198
Let the world see what I see.

03:23.548 --> 03:27.917
I'm sorry. I'm drawing sanchez the turtle.
I made a little bubble where he's saying,

03:27.950 --> 03:29.967
"what's the hurry, guys?"

03:31.867 --> 03:34.734
Watch your back,
"doonesbury."

03:35.903 --> 03:40.036
- All right, steven, you know, I really think you--
- Lay off, okay? I'm dressed fine.

03:40.086 --> 03:42.136
Really?
What's the job?

03:42.186 --> 03:45.220
Are they looking
for an entry-level hobo?

03:46.269 --> 03:50.319
Actually, I'm hoping to get to listen to the
records and pick which ones the stores carry.

03:50.369 --> 03:51.836
In which case,

03:51.886 --> 03:53.869
bye-bye, andy gibb.

03:54.286 --> 03:57.169
What do you have against
good-looking guys?

03:57.702 --> 04:00.955
We're just like you,
except for much better-looking.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.438
You know what you should do?

04:03.496 --> 04:06.046
Bring back swing music.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.344
Hey, sue me. I like a song
I can throw a lady around to.

04:19.861 --> 04:23.011
That 70's Show - Saison 7 Episode 05

04:26.394 --> 04:29.761
Merci Ã  Raceman

04:29.818 --> 04:33.118
www.forom.com

04:56.543 --> 04:59.060
here's where
you'll be working, son.

04:59.626 --> 05:01.260
Well, it's pretty grim.

05:01.776 --> 05:04.876
So is this where we interrogate
the political prisoners?

05:06.860 --> 05:08.433
So, um,

05:08.467 --> 05:10.717
- where's all the records at?
- Right here.

05:10.833 --> 05:15.500
These papers are the sales records for all
of our stores in the greater tri-county area.

05:16.167 --> 05:19.059
These aren't the kind of papers
I thought I'd be working with.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.950
I thought they'd be smaller and
wrapped around something illegal.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.355
Look, I don't wanna bum you out, but
we kind of have a dress code here.

05:27.484 --> 05:28.950
You're dressed pretty casual.

05:29.034 --> 05:31.917
Yeah, but this is silk.
You couldn't pull it off.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.582
Steven, I love your closet.

05:36.632 --> 05:38.499
Where's your office?

05:39.716 --> 05:41.116
Did you follow me here?

05:41.149 --> 05:43.216
And you never even saw me.

05:43.366 --> 05:48.016
See, the trick is, is to stay two
cars behind and one to the left.

05:48.466 --> 05:51.699
Oh, here. I brought you
a very special lunch,

05:51.749 --> 05:55.049
and it's wrapped
in a suit and tie.

05:55.083 --> 05:56.483
Wear it.

05:57.199 --> 06:00.032
A suit? See,
she has the right idea.

06:00.066 --> 06:01.949
Well, I told him
to dress nicer.

06:01.999 --> 06:04.649
But he's poor,
and that's your fault.

06:08.082 --> 06:09.216
Steven,

06:09.232 --> 06:11.708
we're gonna be evaluating
store profits from last quarter,

06:11.742 --> 06:16.592
so your job is to go through these records and
to underline every instance of the word "credit."

06:16.642 --> 06:18.542
That's what I'm gonna be doing
my whole first day?

06:18.575 --> 06:21.259
First day? Ha!
It'll take you a week.

06:21.542 --> 06:24.259
Well, if you get bored,
do what I do--play golf.

06:24.642 --> 06:26.192
I don't play golf.

06:26.359 --> 06:28.475
Good.
You can't leave anyway.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.348
What exactly
are they doing?

06:35.482 --> 06:36.965
I'm not sure.

06:37.282 --> 06:40.715
I think it's like a karate
that kills you with jiggle.

06:43.532 --> 06:45.843
And  that's
how you do tai chi.

06:46.043 --> 06:48.143
Are you boys
ready to try?

06:48.193 --> 06:51.926
No, I think we need to watch
you two do it a little bit more.

06:53.493 --> 06:55.176
They're not trying
to learn, mom.

06:55.226 --> 06:58.734
Otherwise  they wouldn't have
brought lawn chairs and fudgesicles.

06:59.193 --> 07:02.743
Kelso, I thought you were gonna start respecting
women now that you have a daughter.

07:02.776 --> 07:05.976
I am, but you two
are grandfathered in.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.643
I really don't see
what the big deal is, bob.

07:10.676 --> 07:13.576
We brought this tray over
to you full of cookies.

07:13.610 --> 07:16.709
You should have brought it back full
of cookies. That's all I'm saying.

07:17.276 --> 07:20.126
- What are you two doing?
- It's tai chi.

07:20.159 --> 07:22.943
It's an ancient form
of exercise and meditation.

07:23.109 --> 07:27.587
It originated in the far east
in a place called los angeles.

07:29.187 --> 07:32.620
- Seems really interesting. Can I try?
- Sure.

07:32.637 --> 07:36.237
I'd stay out here and try it with you,
but I'd rather go inside and eat.

07:37.333 --> 07:41.349
So the key is to relax
and find your inner peace.

07:41.383 --> 07:43.349
Seems a little exotic,

07:43.383 --> 07:48.958
but if this tai chi is half as good as a
mai tai, I'm sure I'm gonna love it.

07:59.539 --> 08:02.306
You're the new guy, huh?
I'm dennis.

08:03.773 --> 08:05.256
I'm hyde.

08:13.266 --> 08:15.133
Mondays, huh?

08:15.833 --> 08:17.333
I guess.

08:18.266 --> 08:23.033
Well, you picked a good week to start.
We just got a new copy machine.

08:24.183 --> 08:26.166
It's already broken.

08:28.352 --> 08:30.685
I'm really unhappy.

08:39.842 --> 08:40.909
Okay.

08:41.892 --> 08:44.425
Donna was right. I do need
to start respecting women,

08:44.475 --> 08:49.342
so I decided to donate my entire
"playboy" collection to the needy.

08:50.186 --> 08:52.036
Here you go, fez.

08:53.036 --> 08:55.986
You're giving fez a box
full of nudie magazines?

08:56.036 --> 08:58.702
That's like giving a monkey
a loaded gun.

08:59.352 --> 09:03.316
No, it's not.
A monkey with a loaded gun
can hurt a lot of people.

09:03.616 --> 09:06.000
I can only hurt myself.

09:07.116 --> 09:11.150
But a monkey with a loaded gun
would be an awesome tv show.

09:12.066 --> 09:16.656
Everybody would be, like, "aw, don't
worry. It's just a monkey,"and then bam!

09:20.156 --> 09:23.489
Thanks for taking me
to get my tai chi supplies.

09:24.339 --> 09:26.806
What was that wonderful
store called again?

09:26.839 --> 09:30.368
Point place meditation supply
and dried fruit depot.

09:30.434 --> 09:32.884
Well, that is so clever.

09:32.968 --> 09:34.268
Really?

09:34.401 --> 09:37.268
Wow. Your clever threshold's
really low.

09:38.630 --> 09:41.517
This colors a lot of the compliments
that you've given me.

09:43.531 --> 09:46.160
I just love my new buddy.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.984
I think it's called
a buddha.

09:49.416 --> 09:52.066
No, that is not even a word.

09:52.316 --> 09:55.616
Next you'll tell me butter
is called "booder."

09:56.333 --> 09:58.033
What's going on back here?

09:58.183 --> 09:59.366
Hey, look!

09:59.421 --> 10:01.588
You got a thing of me.

10:04.454 --> 10:08.004
I am making this space
my tai chi area.

10:08.079 --> 10:10.729
So you're gonna be
out here,

10:10.779 --> 10:12.762
and I'll be in there
alone?

10:13.196 --> 10:14.979
I love tai chi.

10:15.562 --> 10:17.312
Eric, I got a job for you.

10:17.362 --> 10:20.362
Go grab some cement
and secure that...

10:20.395 --> 10:22.145
bob statue.

10:22.795 --> 10:26.679
Okay, if that's a job,
then how much does that pay?

10:26.929 --> 10:29.996
It pays my foot
not going in your ass.

10:31.346 --> 10:33.412
So it's on credit then.
Good.

10:34.129 --> 10:35.696
Hey, donna, look!

10:35.729 --> 10:37.496
Ho, ho, ho!

10:44.629 --> 10:48.395
I can't tell you how good it makes me
feel to look in here and see my own son.

10:48.429 --> 10:49.562
How's it going?

10:49.595 --> 10:52.579
Well, I'm kind of glad
there's not a window in here.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.378
Probably would have
jumped out of it.

10:56.462 --> 10:59.778
Ah, you kids
with your suicide jokes.

11:53.093 --> 11:55.526
finally finished.

11:55.576 --> 11:57.676
Bad news, hyde.

11:57.759 --> 12:03.809
Sales decided it would be more efficient to whiteout
the credits and underline the debits instead.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.392
But...

12:07.742 --> 12:08.875
but...

12:09.492 --> 12:11.785
but I underlined credits.

12:11.852 --> 12:13.735
If you're interested,

12:13.769 --> 12:17.235
I have some stuff that can
help you get through the day.

12:18.035 --> 12:20.152
Oh, I'm interested.

12:20.419 --> 12:21.685
Cool.

12:23.741 --> 12:26.291
Wait.
What are you talking aut?

12:27.341 --> 12:29.158
What are you talking about?

12:30.525 --> 12:32.691
What are you talking about?

12:32.991 --> 12:34.958
What are you talking about?

12:38.708 --> 12:40.241
Licorice.

12:41.391 --> 12:43.208
Get out of my office!

12:56.455 --> 13:00.321
"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life."

13:26.306 --> 13:28.394
and finished.

13:28.444 --> 13:30.744
Eric, this looks
nothing like me.

13:30.794 --> 13:34.611
Oh, I wasn't drawing you. I just
wanted you to shut up for a little while.

13:38.278 --> 13:40.678
steven! How was
your first day at work?

13:40.711 --> 13:44.828
Damn,  jackie, can't I sit down and
have a beer before you start in on me?

13:46.099 --> 13:47.315
Sorry.

13:47.765 --> 13:51.282
It's the store in skokie. The
numbers just don't add up.

13:51.665 --> 13:55.482
Hey, have you guys seen fez? He was supposed
to meet me at the hub an hour ago.

13:55.532 --> 13:57.398
Where's the last place
you saw him?

13:57.732 --> 14:01.265
Down in the basement
with a box full of "playboys."

14:02.291 --> 14:05.441
Oh, my god. I'll get
the first-aid kit.

14:10.274 --> 14:12.107
We're too late.

14:13.157 --> 14:15.974
He suffered
a massive horny attack.

14:16.391 --> 14:19.674
We're gonna need some gatorade
and a couple of ice packs.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.633
Back off! They're mine!
They're all mine!

14:26.199 --> 14:27.366
Fez,

14:27.416 --> 14:29.233
we're here to help you.

14:29.299 --> 14:32.870
You need to stop, 'cause people
gotta sit on this couch.

14:34.103 --> 14:37.503
Okay, I say we put him and
the couch out on the curb.

14:37.553 --> 14:38.770
No.

14:38.820 --> 14:41.120
Look, fez...

14:43.103 --> 14:47.103
there's a reason that these
magazines only come once a month.

14:47.437 --> 14:50.202
You have to pace yourself.

14:50.518 --> 14:54.035
Do something else besides
look at pornography.

14:54.702 --> 14:57.118
What  kind of a life
is that?

15:03.551 --> 15:04.935
By the way,

15:05.001 --> 15:06.818
any plans you had with me,

15:06.868 --> 15:08.668
they're now off...

15:10.501 --> 15:12.618
until further notice.

15:20.506 --> 15:23.573
I'm having trouble
concentrating.

15:24.905 --> 15:27.722
me too.
That dog is loud.

15:27.789 --> 15:29.672
What dog?

15:30.972 --> 15:35.739
Please stop barking, schotzie.
Mommy's doing her tai chi.

15:39.272 --> 15:44.339
it's not very considerate to bark during
mommy's quiet time, schotzie.

15:45.622 --> 15:48.122
shut your freakin' trap!

15:50.805 --> 15:52.925
This is so soothing.

15:59.842 --> 16:02.459
So, Steven, you're
first day at work.

16:02.509 --> 16:04.826
I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be working there.

16:04.909 --> 16:06.743
I was getting a cup
of coffee, today..

16:06.776 --> 16:10.643
This guy walks up to me and says,
"workin' hard or hardly workin'?"

16:11.393 --> 16:13.608
I threw my powdered
milk at him.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.324
See, that's what I'm looking forward
to about being an artist--

16:17.374 --> 16:20.574
loving my job. And don't get
me wrong. It can be torture

16:20.591 --> 16:23.541
waiting for inspiration to strike,
but it's nice, because

16:23.591 --> 16:25.858
that gives me
time to go bowling.

16:26.608 --> 16:29.041
Did you secure
that statue of bob yet?

16:29.157 --> 16:30.291
I didn't,

16:30.341 --> 16:34.407
but I could give you an artist's
rendering of what that might look like.

16:35.641 --> 16:38.599
You're gonna end up
selling women's shoes.

16:39.124 --> 16:40.849
I don't know
if I can hack it,

16:40.966 --> 16:42.649
working in an office.

16:43.083 --> 16:46.199
My tolerance for following
directions is really low.

16:46.316 --> 16:50.849
Which is ironic, because your
tolerance for other things is really high.

16:52.646 --> 16:55.229
Steven, everybody goes
through the same thing,

16:55.329 --> 17:02.246
but the misery that you feel now will eventually be broken up
by stretches of time where you will feel that you're happy.

17:03.887 --> 17:06.021
Of course, you're not happy.

17:06.737 --> 17:11.070
You're just too numb from your
hellish life to feel the pain.

17:13.148 --> 17:15.282
How was your day, red?

17:16.165 --> 17:17.898
Pretty good, actually.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.249
Hey, W.B., You got a sec?

17:27.299 --> 17:29.882
Steven, I heard
what happened yesterday.

17:29.932 --> 17:34.099
Perhaps I should have been more clear
about our milk-throwing policy.

17:34.849 --> 17:36.215
Look, man,

17:36.282 --> 17:37.965
I don't think
I can work here anymore.

17:37.999 --> 17:39.382
Well, why not?

17:39.432 --> 17:42.282
I just... I don't
belong here.

17:48.213 --> 17:49.646
Dennis?

17:49.846 --> 17:51.646
Tuesdays, huh?

17:53.780 --> 17:55.725
Get outta here!

17:57.425 --> 18:00.709
- Look, I can't let you quit on me.
- You don't know me that well.

18:00.809 --> 18:02.659
I've quit on a lot of people.

18:03.158 --> 18:04.975
No, I mean
I won't let you quit.

18:05.025 --> 18:08.775
You could have a really great future, but you
need somebody to help you get started.

18:08.825 --> 18:12.342
I wasn't there for you when you were
growing up, so I want to do this.

18:12.642 --> 18:15.608
Yeah, but a job?
Can't you just, like,

18:15.658 --> 18:17.725
buy me a stereo?

18:18.992 --> 18:22.475
You're the boss' son. You really
don't have to work that hard.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.086
All right.
I'll give it a week.

18:26.336 --> 18:29.920
But what am I supposed to do
with all those sales reports?

18:30.320 --> 18:33.187
Just give 'em to dennis.
That's what I do.

18:49.022 --> 18:50.938
Fez,  are you okay?

18:51.680 --> 18:56.330
I haven't seen you look this awful since you
found out candyland's not a real country.

18:58.813 --> 19:01.630
It's the bunnies, man.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.060
I haven't slept in a week.

19:07.226 --> 19:09.610
It's only been one day.

19:10.076 --> 19:12.826
Fez, why would you
do this to yourself?

19:12.893 --> 19:15.752
'Cause he can't get
anybody else to do it for him.

19:19.435 --> 19:23.319
I don't have the willpower
to keep these magazines, kelso.

19:24.548 --> 19:26.598
I'm just a boy.

19:27.382 --> 19:30.398
Well, I'd take 'em
off your hands, but

19:30.615 --> 19:33.915
I don't want to actually
touch your hands.

19:34.632 --> 19:35.865
Okay, buddy.

19:35.915 --> 19:38.932
I think you're better off. Just
hand the magazines over to me.

19:43.538 --> 19:46.755
All right.
Fez, you're not letting go.

19:48.738 --> 19:50.305
Oh. Sorry.

19:54.980 --> 19:57.697
You're still holding on.

19:58.547 --> 20:01.264
Look, a robot!

20:05.968 --> 20:08.968
Man, you fall
for that every time.

20:09.234 --> 20:13.068
Yeah? Well, one day,
there's gonna be a robot,

20:13.964 --> 20:17.114
and all you suckers
are gonna miss it.

20:24.646 --> 20:26.629
red, why are you out here?

20:26.679 --> 20:30.512
I thought you were so excited
to have the house to yourself.

20:30.596 --> 20:32.679
I got lonely.

20:33.679 --> 20:35.050
I don't believe it.

20:35.100 --> 20:40.850
They think I have "no artistic talent." You know, I'm beginning
to suspect that the cartoon academy of fort lauderdale

20:40.883 --> 20:42.883
isn't that legitimate.

20:43.350 --> 20:45.633
okay. All right.
Schotzie,

20:45.683 --> 20:49.150
it's time for you to have some
quiet time behind the wall.

20:50.283 --> 20:54.133
Well, I guess it's back
to hand turkeys for me.

20:54.583 --> 20:58.083
I don't know what that means,
but don't do it around here.

21:06.076 --> 21:08.042
schotzie?

21:09.376 --> 21:13.373
You know, that statue was
supposed to bring you peace...

21:14.740 --> 21:16.723
and in a way, it did.

21:19.690 --> 21:21.806
Loving my job now, men.

21:21.861 --> 21:26.877
Being the boss' son means never having to
say, "you'll have it by the end of the day."

21:27.711 --> 21:30.277
Guys, fez is really overdoing it
with the "playboys."

21:30.311 --> 21:35.284
This isn't like the time he ate a case of mars bars,
either. They can't pump your stomach for porn.

21:35.334 --> 21:38.450
I'm not so much worried about fez as
I am schotzie. He goes on the attack

21:38.500 --> 21:42.550
every time he sees
that buddha statue.

21:42.767 --> 21:45.064
And, weirdly, bob.

21:46.305 --> 21:52.860
