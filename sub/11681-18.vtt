WEBVTT

00:00.457 --> 00:02.958
<i>My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.487 --> 00:07.022
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.643 --> 00:10.011
<i>When you're burned,
you've got nothing --</i>

00:10.029 --> 00:12.631
<i>no cash, no credit,
no job history.</i>

00:12.670 --> 00:14.671
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.728 --> 00:16.695
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.886 --> 00:20.055
<i>You do whatever work
comes your way.</i>

00:20.123 --> 00:22.691
<i>You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.759 --> 00:24.293
<i>A trigger-happy
ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.360 --> 00:25.928
Should we shoot them?

00:25.995 --> 00:28.497
<i>...An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.565 --> 00:30.899
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.967 --> 00:33.435
<i>...Family, too...
Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.503 --> 00:35.604
<i>...If you're desperate.
Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.672 --> 00:38.106
<i>Bottom line --
as long as you're burned,</i>

00:38.174 --> 00:39.775
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:44.480 --> 00:46.481
<i>In any desperate situation,</i>

00:46.549 --> 00:49.585
<i>the temptation is always
to act immediately.</i>

00:49.652 --> 00:51.753
<i>It's understandable but unwise.</i>

00:51.821 --> 00:53.789
<i>No matter how bad things are,</i>

00:53.857 --> 00:55.457
<i>the first step
is always the same --</i>

00:55.525 --> 00:57.793
<i>assess the threat</i>

00:57.861 --> 01:00.629
<i>and figure out how bad
things really are.</i>

01:00.697 --> 01:03.265
It's bad, Mike.
It's <i>real</i> bad.

01:03.333 --> 01:05.467
How bad, exactly?

01:05.535 --> 01:07.736
Turns out that any time I called
one of your known associates,

01:07.804 --> 01:10.372
whether it was Barry
or your ma's home phone

01:10.440 --> 01:12.507
or even the Carlito,

01:12.575 --> 01:13.942
there was a major response
at FBI H.Q.

01:14.010 --> 01:15.477
I don't know what Vaughn
is telling these guys,

01:15.545 --> 01:16.678
but there's no question
about it --

01:16.746 --> 01:18.247
he is pulling out
all the stops.

01:18.314 --> 01:19.581
Let me get this straight.

01:19.649 --> 01:21.083
The people
that had you burned

01:21.150 --> 01:22.651
have the FBI
in their pocket?

01:22.719 --> 01:24.586
More like they've got someone
<i>in</i> the FBI.

01:24.654 --> 01:26.088
Someone placed high enough
that they can loose the dogs

01:26.155 --> 01:27.322
when they want to.

01:27.390 --> 01:28.624
And, boy,
they have loosed the dogs.

01:28.691 --> 01:30.759
So, what, we're supposed
to just sit on the list

01:30.827 --> 01:31.927
while they hunt us down?

01:31.995 --> 01:33.562
No.

01:33.630 --> 01:36.098
We keep it safe until we can get
to someone in the government

01:36.165 --> 01:37.232
with some serious clout.

01:37.300 --> 01:39.001
Someone who can play
this card.

01:39.068 --> 01:40.903
Well, last time I checked, we don't
have many friends in the government.

01:40.970 --> 01:42.237
Well, then we need
to <i>make</i> one.

01:42.305 --> 01:43.605
Or die trying.

01:43.673 --> 01:44.773
Well, as appealing
as <i>that</i> sounds...

01:45.942 --> 01:47.276
...I think
I got an idea.

01:51.714 --> 01:53.415
You're serious?!

01:53.483 --> 01:54.983
Maddy, do I look like
I'm joking?

01:55.051 --> 01:57.452
You stash me
in some godforsaken motel,

01:57.520 --> 01:59.821
and now you're asking me
to strong-arm

01:59.889 --> 02:02.057
that jerk on the House
ICtelligence committee again?!

02:02.125 --> 02:03.959
It's the only way, Mad.
The guy is powerful,

02:04.027 --> 02:06.261
and we got enough dirt on him,
he's <i>got</i> to listen to us.

02:06.329 --> 02:07.863
Oh, and he's gonna
help you?

02:07.931 --> 02:09.664
And that would be...Why,
exactly?

02:09.732 --> 02:11.099
This could make him
the most powerful man

02:11.167 --> 02:13.535
in American Intelligence.

02:13.603 --> 02:15.537
A guy like Cowley
won't pass this up.

02:15.605 --> 02:17.806
And, you know, you helped me
get to this guy before,

02:17.874 --> 02:19.207
so, same thing,
different day.

02:19.275 --> 02:23.679
It amazes me the things that
become normal to you people.

02:23.746 --> 02:25.976
I'll take that as a yes.
All right, look.

02:26.216 --> 02:28.684
I checked into his schedule.
Tomorrow's gonna be --
and you put me in a non-smoking room!

02:33.823 --> 02:35.257
I should take this.

02:37.827 --> 02:39.328
That's against the law.

02:39.395 --> 02:40.729
Yeah.

02:40.797 --> 02:43.098
Michael.
Your old pal Vaughn here.

02:43.166 --> 02:44.433
It's been a while.

02:47.470 --> 02:49.771
Been out of touch.

02:49.839 --> 02:52.407
Been keeping
a low profile.

02:52.475 --> 02:54.343
But I think it's time
we should meet.

02:54.410 --> 02:56.111
Great. Let me know the next time
you're in Miami.

02:56.179 --> 02:57.546
We'll grab a mojito.

02:57.613 --> 02:59.448
Well, there's no time
like the present.

02:59.515 --> 03:00.849
I'm in town right now.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.651
Today's bad for me.

03:02.719 --> 03:04.052
Errands.

03:04.120 --> 03:05.921
Ah.

03:05.989 --> 03:07.089
So that's why
you're routing your phone

03:07.156 --> 03:08.090
through three
different numbers.

03:08.157 --> 03:09.391
Well,
you can't be too careful.

03:09.459 --> 03:12.394
You know what?
I'm tired of this coy crap.

03:12.462 --> 03:14.129
What's that
supposed to mean?

03:14.197 --> 03:15.897
I gave you a chance
to be my friend...

03:15.965 --> 03:19.368
Time after time,
but that's over now, Westen.

03:21.604 --> 03:23.205
Now you're gonna see
what it's like

03:23.272 --> 03:24.773
having <i>me</i> for an enemy.

03:24.841 --> 03:27.042
And so are your friends.

03:27.110 --> 03:30.879
And so is your family.

03:54.155 --> 03:56.356
Are we sure we want to
compromise a nuclear facility?

03:56.424 --> 03:58.759
'Cause I got to say, it, uh,
you know, kind of feels wrong.

03:58.826 --> 04:00.527
If the only copy of the list
is in there,

04:00.595 --> 04:02.563
Vaughn could extract
the location from one of us

04:02.630 --> 04:04.565
and still not be able
to get to it.

04:04.632 --> 04:05.899
And by "extract,"

04:05.967 --> 04:08.235
I assume you mean torture,
interrogate, and execute?

04:13.808 --> 04:15.175
Those trucks are carrying

04:15.243 --> 04:17.043
decommissioned
radioactive equipment,

04:17.111 --> 04:18.212
depleted uranium rounds,

04:18.279 --> 04:19.713
nuclear-sub parts --
that kind of thing.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.113
We get <i>this
onto one of those,</i>

04:21.182 --> 04:22.316
and it's locked up tight.

04:22.383 --> 04:23.517
And how do we do that?

04:23.585 --> 04:25.886
If the access road
is closed for repairs,

04:25.954 --> 04:28.455
the trucks will have to stop
long enough for us to get close.

04:28.523 --> 04:31.592
Okay. So we just got to arrange
for a little road damage.

04:31.659 --> 04:33.927
You read my mind.
I'll get my C4.

04:49.911 --> 04:52.179
Well,
there's our buddy Cowley.

04:52.247 --> 04:53.580
Mm. "Fighting for us."

04:53.648 --> 04:56.183
That smug son of a bitch
never fought for anything

04:56.251 --> 04:57.651
in his life
except his own career.

04:57.719 --> 04:59.253
Well, true enough,
but that's kind of the point.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.355
We need a guy like that
to run with this little scandal.

05:01.422 --> 05:02.256
Can we just do this?

05:02.323 --> 05:03.624
Yeah, well, uh,

05:03.691 --> 05:04.925
since I don't have a change
of clothes handy,

05:04.993 --> 05:06.693
I think you got the best bet
of getting inside.

05:06.761 --> 05:08.095
I'm sure you could pass
as the bartender,

05:08.162 --> 05:09.363
maybe a towel boy.

05:09.430 --> 05:10.998
Just get him outside
someplace private.

05:11.065 --> 05:13.133
I'm thinking you can talk
your way through the kitchen.

05:13.201 --> 05:14.534
I think
I can handle this, Sam.

05:15.470 --> 05:17.504
You think you can get yourself
on the docks out back?

05:17.572 --> 05:18.405
Yeah, I think
I can handle that.

05:18.473 --> 05:19.606
Good.

05:23.177 --> 05:25.646
Uh, young lady,
I think we have a problem.

05:25.713 --> 05:27.714
Excuse me?

05:27.782 --> 05:28.982
My husband and I
have been <i>very</i> generous

05:29.050 --> 05:30.317
with Congressman Cowley.

05:30.385 --> 05:31.718
A hell of a lot
more generous

05:31.786 --> 05:33.553
than our table in Siberia
would suggest.

05:33.621 --> 05:35.188
I am so sorry.
I-I'm sure it's a mix-up.

05:35.256 --> 05:36.456
What is your table number?

05:36.524 --> 05:38.325
If you have
your invitation, I ca--

05:38.393 --> 05:39.493
I didn't bring it

05:39.560 --> 05:41.261
because I assumed
I'd be on your list!

05:41.329 --> 05:42.963
I-I'm sure you are,

05:43.031 --> 05:44.731
but if you have your invitation, I can...
Let me see.

05:44.799 --> 05:47.701
Ladies and gentlemen,
Congressman Bill Cowley.

05:48.770 --> 05:49.970
Oh.

05:50.038 --> 05:51.071
Forget it.
It's already started.

05:51.139 --> 05:52.506
Thank you.

05:52.573 --> 05:54.041
We'll talk about this later.
Thank you so much.

05:54.108 --> 05:56.643
You know,
looking out over this crowd,

05:56.711 --> 05:58.979
I'm reminded
of my first campaign.

05:59.047 --> 06:01.248
We've come a long way
since then.

06:01.316 --> 06:02.849
And I've been proud
and honored

06:02.917 --> 06:04.518
to be able to represent you
in our nation's capital.

06:08.823 --> 06:12.726
<i>Road hazards are a key tool
in the spy trade.</i>

06:12.794 --> 06:14.394
<i>Whether you're slowing traffic
for surveillance,</i>

06:14.462 --> 06:17.397
<i>routing cars
to set up a tail,</i>

06:17.465 --> 06:19.132
<i>or putting yourself in place
for an ambush,</i>

06:19.200 --> 06:21.468
<i>it all starts
with a busted road.</i>

06:21.536 --> 06:23.704
That's the last of my C4
and blasting caps.

06:23.771 --> 06:25.639
<i>For a quick and dirty
road hazard</i>

06:25.707 --> 06:27.641
<i>that doesn't take too long
to set up,</i>

06:27.709 --> 06:29.242
<i>a water line is best.</i>

06:29.310 --> 06:31.745
<i>Water can shut down a road
without raising eyebrows.</i>

06:31.813 --> 06:34.414
<i>It's just a matter of getting
a charge in the right place</i>

06:34.482 --> 06:36.616
<i>to bust the pipe underground.</i>

06:36.684 --> 06:38.285
Michael, say this works.

06:38.353 --> 06:39.519
We hide the list,
we get to Cowley --

06:39.587 --> 06:40.887
what, then, with us?

06:40.955 --> 06:42.155
With you and me

06:42.223 --> 06:43.690
and Jesse and Sam
and your mother?

06:43.758 --> 06:45.592
I don't know what you mean
by "what then?"

06:45.660 --> 06:47.327
I want to know what it is
we're fighting for here.

06:47.395 --> 06:49.296
Was it worth getting everyone
marked for death?

06:49.364 --> 06:51.565
If you're asking me if I think
this is important, yes, I do.

06:51.632 --> 06:52.833
I never wanted Vaughn --

06:52.900 --> 06:54.368
none of us wanted
any of this, Michael.

06:54.435 --> 06:55.669
That's not the point.

06:55.737 --> 06:57.371
I want to know what this means
in the end.

06:57.438 --> 06:59.072
Who wins?

06:59.140 --> 07:02.042
'Cause honestly, I feel,
however this turns out, <i>I</i> lose.

07:02.110 --> 07:04.611
Maybe this isn't
your fight, Fi.

07:06.013 --> 07:08.415
Just because it's my path
doesn't mean it's yours.

07:11.219 --> 07:13.520
- Maybe you're right.
- Bad news!

07:13.588 --> 07:17.157
- They're here. They are here. We gotta go.
- What's wrong?

07:17.225 --> 07:19.292
Vaughn's men are here. I just saw them
talking to the guards at the gate.

07:19.360 --> 07:20.494
Well,
how did they know --

07:20.561 --> 07:21.695
I don't know.
They probably had cops

07:21.763 --> 07:22.829
watching the traffic cams
or something.

07:22.897 --> 07:23.597
Doesn't matter.
We got to roll.

08:06.474 --> 08:08.008
<i>What</i> is Michael doing
back there?

08:08.075 --> 08:09.543
Blocking bullets,
it looks like.

08:09.610 --> 08:10.777
Those guys
are pretty strapped, Fi.

08:15.917 --> 08:18.251
<i>Skill will only take you
so far in a car chase.</i>

08:18.319 --> 08:20.053
<i>The bottom line is physics.</i>

08:20.121 --> 08:21.688
<i>Machine versus machine.</i>

08:21.756 --> 08:23.957
<i>If yours comes up short
in that equation,</i>

08:24.025 --> 08:26.493
<i>it's just a matter of time
before it's over.</i>

08:26.561 --> 08:28.228
Fi, pull up
alongside me!

08:28.296 --> 08:29.796
What do you have
planned here?

08:29.864 --> 08:32.299
I still got that
explosive charge you made.

08:32.366 --> 08:33.700
I'm gonna see if I can get us
some breathing room.

08:33.768 --> 08:35.802
Climb into the back.
What?

08:35.870 --> 08:37.304
Do it!

08:41.775 --> 08:43.710
<i>If you can't outrun
your pursuers,</i>

08:43.778 --> 08:45.645
<i>you have a choice to make.</i>

08:45.713 --> 08:48.381
<i>You have to decide
if your vehicle is more useful</i>

08:48.449 --> 08:50.851
<i>as transportation
or as a roadblock.</i>

09:23.751 --> 09:25.652
- Did we lose 'em?
- Yeah. I think.

09:27.054 --> 09:27.787
No.

09:46.140 --> 09:48.341
Let's go!

09:48.409 --> 09:49.943
I just need a second here.

09:50.011 --> 09:52.646
Oh, God, Jesse!
Your leg!

10:16.103 --> 10:19.039
<i>Whether it's the Trojan War,</i>

10:19.106 --> 10:20.307
<i>the Battle of Thermopylae,</i>

10:20.374 --> 10:21.741
<i>or the Last Stand
at the Alamo,</i>

10:21.809 --> 10:24.010
<i>many of the famous battles
in history</i>

10:24.078 --> 10:25.946
<i>were sieges
in which small forces</i>

10:26.013 --> 10:28.415
<i>took on much larger armies.</i>

10:34.388 --> 10:35.555
Jesse, Fi...

10:35.623 --> 10:37.457
What are you carrying?
Just the 9 millimeter.

10:37.525 --> 10:38.792
The rest is
in the motel.

10:38.859 --> 10:39.893
Yeah, I got a 9 mil, too.

10:39.961 --> 10:41.561
Spare clip -- that's it.

10:41.629 --> 10:43.730
<i>Unfortunately,
sieges don't make good stories</i>

10:43.798 --> 10:45.398
<i>because the smaller force won.</i>

10:45.466 --> 10:47.367
<i>They make the history books</i>

10:47.435 --> 10:48.768
<i>because the little guys
fought well...</i>

10:48.836 --> 10:50.303
<i>Before they died.</i>

11:04.315 --> 11:06.316
You hit anything?

11:06.384 --> 11:08.552
They're spreading out
around the hotel behind cover.

11:08.619 --> 11:09.753
I'm just keeping them
from rushing in.

11:09.821 --> 11:11.555
Yeah, well,
in other late-breaking news,

11:11.622 --> 11:12.856
Jesse here
needs a hospital.

11:12.924 --> 11:14.891
Yeah, sorry, man.
Turns out I'm allergic to rebar.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.661
They're jamming signals.
Damn, that was fast.

11:17.729 --> 11:19.329
We need to patch him up
and get deeper into the hotel.

11:19.397 --> 11:20.564
They're not gonna stay
out there forever.

11:26.971 --> 11:28.038
In here.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.646
Keep pressure on it.
We'll be right back.

11:36.714 --> 11:39.049
Not my fight, huh?

11:39.117 --> 11:40.550
Well, I guess
it's everyone's fight now.

11:40.618 --> 11:42.152
I never wanted this, Fi.

11:42.220 --> 11:44.955
Jesse's leg is broken,
and he's bleeding.

11:45.022 --> 11:47.524
It's dumb luck his
femoral artery wasn't severed.

11:48.926 --> 11:50.060
And we're surrounded.

11:50.128 --> 11:52.095
You know, this may be
your war, Michael,

11:52.163 --> 11:53.697
but we're all caught in the crossfire.
Fiona --

11:53.765 --> 11:55.432
Save it!

11:55.500 --> 11:56.833
You can apologize
if we live.

11:58.669 --> 12:00.637
<i>Combat medicine
is not necessarily</i>

12:00.705 --> 12:02.973
<i>about long-term healing.</i>

12:03.040 --> 12:06.343
<i>Civilian doctors try
to immobilize injured limbs</i>

12:06.410 --> 12:07.711
<i>to make sure
they knit properly.</i>

12:07.779 --> 12:10.347
<i>Field medics often have
to do the opposite</i>

12:10.414 --> 12:12.482
<i>and make broken limbs
as usable as possible.</i>

12:12.550 --> 12:16.119
<i>Walking on a broken, bloody leg
isn't good for you,</i>

12:16.187 --> 12:18.155
<i>but it's better
than taking a bullet.</i>

12:19.223 --> 12:21.424
Let's go.
We got to move.

12:21.492 --> 12:24.661
You got a hell of
a bedside manner, Dr. Westen.

12:32.036 --> 12:34.538
What's up with this place?
Who builds half a hotel?

12:34.605 --> 12:36.173
Someone who was
in mid-renovation

12:36.240 --> 12:37.841
when their bank
went under.

12:37.909 --> 12:40.844
Oh, I wish they would have ran
out of money a little later.

12:40.912 --> 12:42.345
Could go for a couple of bottles
of minibar rum

12:42.413 --> 12:43.814
and some air-conditioning
right about now.

12:43.881 --> 12:45.415
We got bigger problems
than that.

12:45.483 --> 12:47.083
Look who's here.

12:52.657 --> 12:54.090
What now?

12:54.158 --> 12:55.859
They're setting up
for the long haul.

12:55.927 --> 12:58.161
With us cut off, their best move
is to be patient.

12:58.229 --> 12:59.996
And <i>our</i> best move?

13:00.064 --> 13:02.365
We need to get to the emergency
weather equipment on the roof.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.733
They can jam the phones,

13:03.801 --> 13:06.269
but if they jam the
Emergency Broadcast System...

13:06.337 --> 13:08.305
They'll have every cop
in Miami here -- nice.

13:08.372 --> 13:10.674
Oh, look.

13:10.741 --> 13:13.076
Vaughn's minion
just handed him a Sat phone.

13:28.226 --> 13:31.194
Bay Point Hotel.
How may I direct your call?

13:31.262 --> 13:32.829
Funny. Should have met me
when I asked, Michael.

13:32.897 --> 13:34.030
It would have been
a lot easier.

13:34.098 --> 13:35.999
Sorry to
inconvenience you.

13:36.067 --> 13:37.601
Yeah, well,
don't worry about me.

13:37.668 --> 13:38.935
Worry about
your girlfriend.

13:39.003 --> 13:40.537
Worry about that man
that's bleeding to death inside.

13:40.605 --> 13:42.272
And worry
about your family.

13:42.340 --> 13:43.840
What do you want?

13:43.908 --> 13:44.941
You know what I want.

13:45.009 --> 13:46.543
Word is you have
a thumb drive

13:46.611 --> 13:48.645
with information
that does not belong to you.

13:48.713 --> 13:49.779
Oh, you mean the list

13:49.847 --> 13:51.882
of the I.D.s of you
and your associates?

13:51.949 --> 13:53.416
Yeah,
I got it right here.

13:53.484 --> 13:55.752
If you want it,
you have to come in and get it.

13:55.820 --> 13:57.554
So you're gonna play it
like that, huh?

13:57.622 --> 13:59.256
Fine.

13:59.323 --> 14:00.957
See you soon.

14:02.827 --> 14:03.860
You're inviting him in?

14:03.928 --> 14:05.128
He was coming in anyway.

14:05.196 --> 14:06.763
You and Jesse
need to keep his men back

14:06.831 --> 14:08.064
until I can get
to the roof.

14:08.132 --> 14:09.165
I think we can
whip something up.

14:10.568 --> 14:11.668
How are you doing?

14:11.736 --> 14:13.470
Won't be running a marathon
anytime soon,

14:13.537 --> 14:14.704
but...I'll manage.

14:14.772 --> 14:16.206
We need
catering supplies.

14:16.274 --> 14:18.408
The, uh, fuel cans they use
for hot plates

14:18.476 --> 14:19.910
and the little
propane tanks

14:19.977 --> 14:21.411
they use for
the omelette stations.

14:21.479 --> 14:22.879
Okay.

14:22.947 --> 14:26.149
We're fighting them off
with breakfast equipment.

14:26.217 --> 14:28.718
It's the most important meal
of the day.

14:30.421 --> 14:32.055
Well, what's this?

14:38.396 --> 14:39.896
Jackpot.

14:41.465 --> 14:43.867
All right,
that's the last of them.

14:46.938 --> 14:48.071
Secure it real tight.

14:48.139 --> 14:49.673
There.

14:51.943 --> 14:53.810
What's going on
with you and Mike?

14:53.878 --> 14:55.879
I just noticed
you guys were...

14:55.947 --> 14:59.482
You know what? Forget it.
It's none of my business

14:59.550 --> 15:00.717
I shouldn't have asked.

15:02.887 --> 15:04.754
It's fine.

15:04.822 --> 15:08.291
I used to think that all this
spy business of Michael's --

15:08.359 --> 15:10.360
the burn notice,
all of it --

15:10.428 --> 15:13.396
was just something
that he needed to get past --

15:13.464 --> 15:14.931
that he'd be done with it, and
he could move on with his life.

15:14.999 --> 15:16.132
And what about now?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.534
Well, now I'm beginning
to realize

15:17.601 --> 15:18.401
that maybe it <i>is
his life.</i>

15:19.770 --> 15:22.572
You know, what you --
what you and Mike have is...

15:22.640 --> 15:23.807
Special.

15:23.874 --> 15:25.141
There's no question.

15:25.209 --> 15:27.944
But I don't think
you get involved with someone

15:28.012 --> 15:29.346
like Michael Westen,

15:29.413 --> 15:32.449
hoping he's gonna buy a house
on the lake, settle down.

15:37.088 --> 15:38.221
They're downstairs.

15:46.931 --> 15:48.064
Visitors
will be here soon.

15:51.769 --> 15:52.869
Thank you.

15:52.937 --> 15:54.671
Your support
makes it all possible.

15:54.739 --> 15:56.172
Excuse me, Congressman?

15:56.240 --> 15:59.909
Uh, could I talk to you
a moment?

15:59.977 --> 16:01.544
Excuse me.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.714
Oh, then you remember me.

16:04.782 --> 16:06.783
Well, it's good
to see you again, too!

16:06.851 --> 16:08.451
I thought we agreed,
after our last encounter,

16:08.519 --> 16:10.053
I would never see you
and your friends again.

16:10.121 --> 16:11.755
Oh.

16:11.822 --> 16:13.923
Well, I guess you thought wrong.

16:13.991 --> 16:16.459
Um, we need to talk
to you outside,

16:16.527 --> 16:17.694
like now?

16:17.762 --> 16:20.230
Now? I'm in the middle
of an event.

16:20.297 --> 16:21.698
Uh-huh.

16:21.766 --> 16:24.267
Well, there's a much more
important event than this.

16:24.335 --> 16:25.468
That's why we're here.

16:25.536 --> 16:27.037
Yeah.

16:27.104 --> 16:28.605
Well, the last time
I listened to you,

16:28.672 --> 16:30.540
I nearly got killed
by a Russian wetwork team.

16:30.608 --> 16:33.076
And you came out of it
looking like a hero.

16:33.144 --> 16:34.778
I'm sorry, didn't you win
your last election

16:34.845 --> 16:35.912
with 70% of the vote?

16:35.980 --> 16:37.414
76%.

16:37.481 --> 16:39.516
Well, there you go.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.751
I guess that means we're <i>really</i>
good people to talk to, then.

16:43.387 --> 16:44.788
After you.

16:50.428 --> 16:52.762
<i>Eventually,
the information spies obtain</i>

16:52.830 --> 16:55.432
<i>usually ends up in the hands
of a politician.</i>

16:55.499 --> 16:58.735
<i>The relationship between spies
and politicians is never easy,</i>

16:58.803 --> 17:00.303
<i>but they need each other.</i>

17:00.371 --> 17:02.639
<i>By themselves,
secrets are just words.</i>

17:02.706 --> 17:04.741
<i>Covert intelligence
is only as powerful</i>

17:04.809 --> 17:06.175
<i>as the person who uses it.</i>

17:06.242 --> 17:08.944
A covert network operating
within the government.

17:10.347 --> 17:11.513
You're serious?

17:11.582 --> 17:13.715
You're gonna put on
your tin-foil hat

17:13.784 --> 17:15.952
and tell me
about the aliens now?

17:16.020 --> 17:17.520
Look, I wish I <i>was</i> crazy,
Congressman,

17:17.588 --> 17:18.721
but this is the real deal.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.457
We've seen it
up close and personal.

17:20.523 --> 17:22.258
A lot closer than <i>I'd</i> like,
believe me.

17:22.326 --> 17:24.127
This list
you claim to have --

17:24.194 --> 17:26.930
it's got the names of the people
in this network?

17:26.997 --> 17:28.865
Anybody can put names
on a list.

17:28.933 --> 17:30.433
Do you remember the business
with John Barrett?

17:30.501 --> 17:31.501
The shootout in the middle
of Miami?

17:31.569 --> 17:32.836
What about it?

17:32.903 --> 17:34.637
Do you know why he was
in Miami, Congressman?

17:34.705 --> 17:36.506
'Cause he sure as hell
wasn't here on vacation.

17:36.574 --> 17:37.707
That's been investigated.

17:37.775 --> 17:39.375
I was on
the congressional committee.

17:39.443 --> 17:40.743
Okay, good.
Then you know

17:40.811 --> 17:41.845
some of the facts
that weren't in the papers,

17:41.912 --> 17:43.079
like the fact
that Barrett's body

17:43.147 --> 17:44.380
was found about a mile
from the others,

17:44.448 --> 17:46.082
the fact
that he was carrying

17:46.150 --> 17:47.650
a silver briefcase
that just disappeared.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.152
Where'd you hear
about that?

17:49.220 --> 17:51.221
I didn't hear about it.
I was there. I saw it.

17:51.288 --> 17:53.123
And you know what was
in that briefcase, sir?

17:53.190 --> 17:54.023
The list.

17:55.926 --> 17:57.894
Interested <i>now?</i>

18:09.507 --> 18:12.175
They're coming this way.
You ready? I can't wait.

18:12.243 --> 18:14.944
<i>Different explosives
have different properties.</i>

18:15.012 --> 18:17.013
<i>Some release their energy
in the blast,</i>

18:17.081 --> 18:20.316
<i>while others create more heat
and flame than force.</i>

18:20.384 --> 18:21.885
<i>Bottom line?
You won't destroy a lot</i>

18:21.952 --> 18:24.087
<i>with propane and canned fuel,</i>

18:24.155 --> 18:26.156
<i>but you can put on
a very big show.</i>

18:26.223 --> 18:27.190
Now.

18:38.302 --> 18:39.869
Blast in the hallway.

18:39.937 --> 18:41.905
We're dealing with it.
Maintain position.

18:41.972 --> 18:42.872
Over.

18:45.943 --> 18:46.876
Copy that.

18:46.944 --> 18:48.811
Maintaining position.

19:00.024 --> 19:01.057
Drop your weapon.

19:11.702 --> 19:13.069
Aah!

19:15.239 --> 19:16.673
Aah!

19:53.043 --> 19:55.445
Vest --
on the ground <i>now.</i>

20:05.456 --> 20:06.656
Zip tie your hands.

20:06.724 --> 20:08.258
Zip ties...

20:08.325 --> 20:09.692
I don't have any.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.327
Plan "B," then.

20:11.395 --> 20:13.329
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

20:13.397 --> 20:14.731
Okay.

20:22.039 --> 20:23.206
Good boy.

20:41.225 --> 20:44.560
That's an ex-special forces
sniper out there.

20:44.628 --> 20:46.996
Good luck making it back
to the door.

20:47.064 --> 20:50.400
It's over, man.

20:50.467 --> 20:51.567
Just stand down.

20:54.271 --> 20:55.338
I got a better idea.

20:55.406 --> 20:56.906
How much do you weigh --
about 200?

20:59.576 --> 21:00.843
205?

21:07.785 --> 21:10.286
<i>To rappel down a building,</i>

21:10.354 --> 21:12.955
<i>you need something
to slow your descent.</i>

21:13.023 --> 21:15.792
<i>Usually
that's an anchor point,</i>

21:15.859 --> 21:18.061
<i>but a counterweight
is equally effective.</i>

21:21.065 --> 21:23.266
<i>Although it's not much fun</i>

21:23.334 --> 21:25.902
<i>for whomever gets to be
the counterweight.</i>

21:46.586 --> 21:49.087
You think this little emergency
call is gonna work?

21:49.155 --> 21:50.522
As sure as I <i>can</i> be.

21:50.590 --> 21:52.057
I sent out
a major distress signal

21:52.125 --> 21:53.492
with the equipment
on the roof.

21:53.559 --> 21:55.961
As far as the emergency
broadcast system is concerned,

21:56.029 --> 21:57.462
this hotel is getting hit

21:57.530 --> 21:59.598
by a hurricane, fire,
and nuclear attack all at once.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.299
About half a dozen
cop cars --

22:01.367 --> 22:03.135
should make
for a fair fight, anyway.

22:03.202 --> 22:04.836
We should get
someplace visible.

22:04.904 --> 22:07.005
We don't want to get killed
by some convenient accident

22:07.073 --> 22:08.407
when they get here.

22:08.474 --> 22:09.941
Well,
there's a balcony here.

22:10.009 --> 22:12.044
Clear view of the road,
good cover.

22:12.111 --> 22:13.478
Good. We can stay there.

22:18.184 --> 22:19.351
Wait, hold the phone.

22:19.419 --> 22:20.318
Guys, check it out.

22:22.255 --> 22:23.555
What's happening?
What are they doing?

22:23.623 --> 22:24.823
I don't know.

22:35.401 --> 22:37.836
Nice try, Westen.

22:37.904 --> 22:40.038
Problem is, one of the guys
on that list you found...

22:40.106 --> 22:41.573
Is with Homeland Security.

22:41.641 --> 22:44.376
He told his boys we were doing
a training exercise.

22:44.444 --> 22:46.712
Well, you tell him
thanks from me.

22:46.779 --> 22:48.680
Way to secure
the homeland.

22:48.748 --> 22:49.981
They're not coming back.

22:50.049 --> 22:51.850
Now, you want Jesse
to bleed out in there?

22:51.918 --> 22:54.019
You want to end this now?
Bring me the list.

22:55.088 --> 22:57.222
I don't know what he's talking
about -- I've never been better.

22:57.290 --> 23:00.659
He says he feels fine.
It's just a scratch.

23:00.727 --> 23:02.828
Yeah, well, we'll just
have to see, won't we?

23:02.895 --> 23:04.096
It'll be dark soon.

23:04.163 --> 23:06.732
Nobody's gonna come
to your rescue, Michael.

23:06.799 --> 23:08.600
We got all the time
in the world.

23:11.037 --> 23:12.704
We need a new plan.

23:12.772 --> 23:14.873
A new plan sounds good
right about now.

23:14.941 --> 23:18.810
I passed a groundskeeping room
on the way to the roof.

23:18.878 --> 23:20.378
They got to have fertilizer
and fuel.

23:20.446 --> 23:22.080
What are you thinking,
like an anfo bomb?

23:22.148 --> 23:25.183
We lure them to the top floors,
we blow the stairwell,

23:25.251 --> 23:26.985
we go down
the elevator shaft,

23:27.053 --> 23:28.153
we get out of here.

23:28.221 --> 23:29.254
Then what?

23:29.322 --> 23:31.223
We hope Sam did <i>his</i> job.

23:31.290 --> 23:32.758
I'm done explaining,
Congressman.

23:32.825 --> 23:34.326
I can talk all day long
about this,

23:34.393 --> 23:35.827
but it's not gonna change
a thing.

23:35.895 --> 23:37.095
We need a leap
of faith here.

23:37.163 --> 23:39.664
I didn't get where I am now
with leaps of faith.

23:39.732 --> 23:41.900
Okay, how about
"enlightened self-interest"?

23:41.968 --> 23:43.535
You move now,
it's the kind of stuff

23:43.603 --> 23:44.936
that'll get
into history books.

23:45.004 --> 23:47.205
If not,
history passes you by.

23:47.273 --> 23:50.442
I'm not making a move without
checking this out with someone.

23:50.510 --> 23:52.744
That's fine, but it's got to go
to the top, and the top only.

23:52.812 --> 23:55.046
The guys we're up against
are well-connected.

23:55.114 --> 23:57.682
They're gonna find out if you start
involving the chain of command.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.951
I know what I'm doing.

24:00.019 --> 24:02.487
Well, what do you think?

24:02.555 --> 24:05.157
Well, I think he's gonna cover
his butt a little, but he's in.

24:05.224 --> 24:06.591
The guy can smell
an opportunity.

24:06.659 --> 24:07.893
Okay, look, Maddy,

24:07.960 --> 24:09.795
you've gone way above and beyond
the call here,

24:09.862 --> 24:11.863
but it's time for you
to get someplace safe.

24:11.931 --> 24:13.665
There's nothing more
to do here.

24:13.733 --> 24:15.033
Are you gonna be okay?

24:15.101 --> 24:16.268
I'm gonna be fine.

24:16.335 --> 24:17.569
You get down
to Homestead,

24:17.637 --> 24:18.970
you use cash,
you hide out,

24:19.038 --> 24:20.539
and we'll call you
when we can.

24:20.606 --> 24:22.007
Come <i>on.
Maddy...</i>

24:22.074 --> 24:23.842
You don't do this,
Mike's gonna kick my butt.

24:25.812 --> 24:27.779
Stay away from bullets.

24:31.684 --> 24:33.852
See ya, Sam.

24:38.991 --> 24:41.560
You make your calls?
We good?

24:41.627 --> 24:43.662
I made some calls.
And?

24:43.729 --> 24:45.430
There's something to it,
I grant you.

24:45.498 --> 24:47.332
It would answer a few
outstanding questions

24:47.400 --> 24:48.366
about that
Barrett debacle.

24:48.434 --> 24:49.835
Yeah. But...

24:49.902 --> 24:51.236
I need to take my time.

24:51.304 --> 24:52.804
Something like this --
it's delicate.

24:52.872 --> 24:54.573
You play it wrong,
it'll blow up in your face.

24:54.640 --> 24:56.174
We don't have time for that,
Congressman!

24:56.242 --> 24:57.242
These people
are dangerous!

24:57.310 --> 24:58.476
Dangerous to <i>you,</i> maybe.

24:58.544 --> 25:00.078
I'm not starting
a major investigation

25:00.146 --> 25:01.546
based on the paranoid
fantasy

25:01.614 --> 25:03.748
of a guy who dresses like
a cruise-ship bartender...

25:03.816 --> 25:06.318
...And doesn't know how
to use a razor.

25:06.385 --> 25:08.186
Yeah.

25:08.254 --> 25:09.955
Meet me in front of the hotel
in five.

25:10.022 --> 25:11.556
Wait. What?

25:13.426 --> 25:15.360
What did he say?

25:15.428 --> 25:17.929
No, I'm fine.
I'll call you back.

25:17.997 --> 25:19.865
I said
I'll call you back.

25:22.869 --> 25:24.603
The police were talking
to my driver.

25:24.670 --> 25:27.439
Apparently, they want to take me
into protective custody.

25:27.506 --> 25:29.641
Said there's a threat
against my life.

25:29.709 --> 25:31.276
There's an APB
out on me now.

25:31.344 --> 25:33.278
The police?
Who did you call?

25:33.346 --> 25:34.646
I called
who I needed to.

25:34.714 --> 25:36.514
FBI is running a background
check on you now.

25:36.582 --> 25:38.183
The FBI --
you got to be kidding me.

25:38.251 --> 25:39.351
I told you
not to do that!

25:39.418 --> 25:40.886
Hey, back off!

25:40.953 --> 25:43.355
You come in to my fundraiser
and dump <i>this</i> into my lap?

25:43.422 --> 25:45.257
Okay, yeah. Fine.

25:45.324 --> 25:46.725
Go into
"protective custody."

25:46.792 --> 25:48.693
Maybe they'll jerk you around
until we're all dead,

25:48.761 --> 25:50.929
or maybe they'll kill you because
I told you their secrets.

25:50.997 --> 25:53.064
So what do you think?
You feeling lucky?

25:53.132 --> 25:54.966
You got a choice,
Congressman.

25:55.034 --> 25:56.201
You can go with me
right now,

25:56.269 --> 25:57.502
and you can go
with the cops

25:57.570 --> 26:00.005
and see how my paranoid fantasy
plays out.

26:06.112 --> 26:07.245
Let's go.

26:10.349 --> 26:11.917
<i>A typical explosive device</i>

26:11.984 --> 26:13.952
<i>is a combination
of a high explosive</i>

26:14.020 --> 26:15.287
<i>and a low explosive.</i>

26:15.354 --> 26:16.688
<i>One starts the reaction</i>

26:16.756 --> 26:19.291
<i>while the other supplies
the force of the blast.</i>

26:19.358 --> 26:23.361
<i>Improvising a low explosive
is basic chemistry.</i>

26:23.429 --> 26:26.598
<i>Improvising a high-explosive
blasting cap is high art.</i>

26:28.234 --> 26:29.901
We good?
Good enough.

26:29.969 --> 26:32.003
It'll have to be hard-wired...

26:32.071 --> 26:34.139
...Since all the phone signals
are blocked.

26:34.206 --> 26:36.141
I guess it's
the old-fashioned way.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.475
We'll only get one shot
at this,

26:37.543 --> 26:38.410
so let's make it count.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.181
You never really talked
to Jesse

26:43.249 --> 26:45.250
after...everything.

26:45.318 --> 26:47.419
He wasn't that eager
to chat.

26:47.486 --> 26:49.688
Well, you know,
he's not doing too well,

26:49.755 --> 26:52.257
so if you're gonna talk,
now would be the time.

26:52.325 --> 26:53.792
Let's focus
on saving his life.

26:53.859 --> 26:56.628
I'll worry about last words
if it comes to that.

26:56.696 --> 26:58.530
Oh, there you are.

26:58.597 --> 27:00.165
Going down?

27:00.232 --> 27:01.299
How's it look
down there?

27:01.367 --> 27:02.834
Oh, dark and greasy,
but it'll do.

27:02.902 --> 27:04.970
If you can get Vaughn's men
trapped in the stairwell,

27:05.037 --> 27:06.037
we can go down
the shaft.

27:06.105 --> 27:07.539
There's an access ladder
right there.

27:07.606 --> 27:09.174
Time to get Vaughn
to bring the party to us.

27:11.978 --> 27:13.778
This is Fiona Glenanne.

27:13.846 --> 27:15.914
I need to speak to Vaughn.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.315
Fiona,
great to hear your voice.

27:17.383 --> 27:18.717
What can I do for you?

27:18.784 --> 27:21.319
You can get us out of here.
I'm sick of hiding.

27:21.387 --> 27:23.288
Talked to Michael.

27:23.356 --> 27:24.322
Didn't seem
to feel the same.

27:24.390 --> 27:26.424
Well, you were right, okay?

27:28.260 --> 27:29.694
Jesse's in bad shape.

27:29.762 --> 27:31.229
I need to make a deal.

27:31.297 --> 27:33.898
I'm listening.
What are your terms?

27:33.966 --> 27:36.368
You walk away with the list.
We walk away with our lives.

27:38.004 --> 27:39.838
Fair enough.
Go on.

27:39.905 --> 27:41.840
Come in with your team.

27:41.907 --> 27:44.709
We're on the top floor,
east side.

27:44.777 --> 27:46.411
I'll handle Michael.

27:46.479 --> 27:47.846
I don't want him hurt.

27:47.913 --> 27:50.181
Yeah, I can do that.
You know...

27:50.249 --> 27:51.983
I gave you a way out
a long time ago, Fiona.

27:52.051 --> 27:53.385
You should have taken
that deal.

27:53.452 --> 27:56.021
Yeah, well,
if I had to do it all over,

27:56.088 --> 27:57.555
Michael and I would be
sipping champagne

27:57.623 --> 28:00.125
on the Place des Vosges
in Paris right now...

28:00.192 --> 28:02.127
But here we are.

28:02.194 --> 28:04.396
Here we are, indeed.

28:04.463 --> 28:06.564
All right,
I'll get the team together.

28:07.833 --> 28:09.734
Let's get ready.

28:09.802 --> 28:11.202
Whether we make it
out of this or not,

28:11.270 --> 28:12.904
I want to blast that smug
son of a bitch to hell.

28:14.373 --> 28:15.974
So this is your plan?

28:16.042 --> 28:17.208
To ran away
along the seawall?

28:17.276 --> 28:18.543
Uh, no, Congressman.

28:18.611 --> 28:20.512
Since you're the one
who tipped off the bad guys,

28:20.579 --> 28:21.880
I'd say this is <i>your</i> plan.

28:21.947 --> 28:23.815
Yeah. Mike.

28:23.883 --> 28:25.650
Listen,
I called you three times.

28:25.718 --> 28:27.552
We got a deal,
but I need to hear from you now.

28:27.620 --> 28:29.154
Call me.

28:29.221 --> 28:31.890
Damn it.
The cops are everywhere.

28:34.593 --> 28:36.694
Look, we got to get around
this local law enforcement.

28:36.762 --> 28:39.531
You said you talked to your
intelligence buddies, right?

28:39.598 --> 28:40.832
That's right.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.634
Well, call them again.
We need some help here.

28:42.701 --> 28:44.235
This is not
a staring contest.

28:50.009 --> 28:52.210
They're on the ground floor.
Not yet.

28:52.278 --> 28:54.312
We need as many of them
in the stairwell as possible

28:54.380 --> 28:55.313
before we blow it.

28:55.381 --> 28:56.748
That's a lot of bodies.

28:56.816 --> 28:57.882
Fi, if there was any other way.

28:57.950 --> 28:59.684
Fiona?

29:03.322 --> 29:05.290
Yes?

29:05.357 --> 29:06.791
Yeah. I just want
to let you know

29:06.859 --> 29:08.226
we're coming up
with my team.

29:08.294 --> 29:11.062
I'm getting Michael
in place.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.230
You do that.

29:12.298 --> 29:13.665
But before you go
any further,

29:13.732 --> 29:15.400
I think there's something
you should know.

29:15.468 --> 29:18.169
I remember how
our last "deal" went.

29:18.237 --> 29:20.839
So I brought along
some insurance

29:20.906 --> 29:22.307
just as a precaution

29:22.374 --> 29:23.308
in case you had
something planned.

29:24.543 --> 29:27.212
What do you mean?

29:27.279 --> 29:28.480
Brought along a friend.

29:28.547 --> 29:30.081
Police found her on the road,
headed south.

29:30.149 --> 29:31.216
Say hi to mom.

29:33.819 --> 29:35.653
Say something, mom.

29:35.721 --> 29:37.922
Go to hell, you bastard!

29:43.830 --> 29:45.431
Michael,
they've got your mother.

29:45.531 --> 29:47.399
If we blow the stairwell,
she's dead.

29:47.467 --> 29:48.800
Give me the radio.

29:54.607 --> 29:55.807
Vaughn,
let me talk to her.

29:55.875 --> 29:58.010
Oh. So <i>there</i> he is.

29:58.077 --> 29:59.945
Fiona said
you weren't involved.

30:00.013 --> 30:02.047
So I guess you had
something planned.

30:02.115 --> 30:03.815
I'm glad
I took precautions.

30:03.883 --> 30:05.417
Let me talk to her <i>now.</i>

30:05.485 --> 30:06.818
Hey, you watch your tone
there, Michael.

30:06.886 --> 30:08.220
If you're not careful,
she can get hurt.

30:08.287 --> 30:10.822
Ohh!

30:10.890 --> 30:12.124
Vaughn!

30:12.191 --> 30:13.892
Calm down, Michael.
That was just a love tap.

30:13.960 --> 30:15.627
Talk to him.

30:20.767 --> 30:22.334
Talk to him!

30:22.402 --> 30:23.869
Michael, are you there?

30:27.940 --> 30:29.641
Yeah, mom, I'm here.
You okay?

30:31.110 --> 30:32.878
No, I'm not okay.

30:32.945 --> 30:34.346
They shot me.

30:34.414 --> 30:35.347
It doesn't matter
what you do, Michael.

30:35.415 --> 30:37.015
Run, Michael!

30:37.083 --> 30:38.116
Shut up!

30:38.184 --> 30:39.284
Run, Michael!

30:42.121 --> 30:43.522
She's fine, Michael.

30:43.589 --> 30:45.957
She's lying.
But I'd be more than happy

30:46.025 --> 30:46.892
to shoot her
if it comes to that.

30:46.959 --> 30:49.728
Leave her alone, Vaughn.

30:49.796 --> 30:51.630
I'm coming down.

30:51.698 --> 30:53.999
Oh, yeah.

30:54.067 --> 30:55.567
I'll believe that
when I see it.

30:57.437 --> 30:58.970
So, now...

30:59.038 --> 31:01.406
Does being too clever for your
own good run in your family?

31:02.642 --> 31:04.176
Could be.

31:04.243 --> 31:07.045
Does being a sadistic <i>bastard
run in yours?</i>

31:07.113 --> 31:09.881
Hang on to her.

31:09.949 --> 31:11.316
She could
still be useful.

31:18.324 --> 31:20.158
I can't see anything.

31:21.561 --> 31:24.396
They must still be inside.

31:24.464 --> 31:26.565
Do you think he did it?
You think he shot her?

31:26.632 --> 31:27.899
It doesn't matter.

31:27.967 --> 31:29.601
Obviously she knows
no one's walking away from this.

31:29.669 --> 31:31.303
Vaughn's not gonna honor
any deal we make.

31:31.370 --> 31:32.738
Are you sure about that?

31:32.805 --> 31:34.539
I mean, what if we --
I don't know --

31:34.607 --> 31:35.874
What if we traded --

31:35.942 --> 31:38.110
traded what --
the list, ourselves?

31:38.177 --> 31:40.879
Once we've made the trade,
we have no leverage.

31:40.947 --> 31:43.181
Vaughn can't afford to have us
walking around --

31:43.249 --> 31:44.649
no matter what.

31:44.717 --> 31:48.386
Now, the only hope we have
to save her and ourselves

31:48.454 --> 31:51.056
is to put this list in the
right hands as soon as we can.

31:51.124 --> 31:52.891
All right, well, that sounds great.
How the hell do we do that?

31:52.959 --> 31:55.460
If I can get
to that building...

31:55.528 --> 31:57.596
I'll draw their fire.

31:57.663 --> 32:00.732
I can bring along
an explosive charge to use.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.869
Once they get close...

32:03.936 --> 32:06.471
That should give you a window
to get out with the list.

32:09.408 --> 32:11.042
That's a suicide mission
for you.

32:11.110 --> 32:13.011
Staying here is suicide
for <i>all</i> of us.

32:13.079 --> 32:15.514
But if you can get out of here,
Fi, with this list,

32:15.581 --> 32:16.648
you can save my mom.

32:16.716 --> 32:18.483
I'll do it.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.285
I can get out there.
I can draw their fire.

32:20.353 --> 32:22.420
Look...

32:22.488 --> 32:24.022
I'm injured anyway.

32:24.090 --> 32:27.359
No. We need Vaughn to focus
all his forces.

32:27.426 --> 32:29.327
He's after me, not you.

32:29.395 --> 32:32.230
He thinks I would <i>never
let this go.</i>

32:32.298 --> 32:33.999
That's why <i>you</i> need
to take it.

32:39.272 --> 32:40.705
Keep it safe.

32:43.342 --> 32:45.010
And for what it's worth,
Agent Porter,

32:45.077 --> 32:46.344
I am sorry
for what I did to you.

32:47.947 --> 32:50.182
I never said it,
but I am truly sorry.

32:50.249 --> 32:52.784
Come on, man, just...

32:52.852 --> 32:55.320
I signed up
to fight the bad guys, right?

32:55.388 --> 32:57.322
That's all you were
ever doing, so...

32:57.390 --> 32:59.357
We're in this together.

32:59.425 --> 33:01.593
Are you good with that?

33:01.661 --> 33:03.929
Yeah.
I'm good with that.

33:05.898 --> 33:07.065
Michael.

33:11.771 --> 33:14.139
You said it yourself,
Fiona.

33:14.207 --> 33:16.274
Maybe it's time
you went your own way.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.172
Looks like he's in.
Come on, let's go.

34:22.241 --> 34:23.507
Let's go.

34:25.777 --> 34:28.079
Put her in the car.

34:28.147 --> 34:30.382
Get her in the damn car!

34:30.449 --> 34:32.117
And grab a window seat,
mom...

34:32.184 --> 34:33.418
So you can watch me
kill your boy.

34:37.523 --> 34:38.956
No!

34:46.933 --> 34:49.167
Fi, come on!
We got to go!

34:49.235 --> 34:50.502
No.
You take the list.

34:50.569 --> 34:52.804
You're the one who knows
what to do with it.

34:52.871 --> 34:54.672
- I'm going back out there with --
- No, no, Fiona!

34:54.739 --> 34:56.074
Listen to me.

34:56.141 --> 34:57.676
If you go back out there,
you know what's gonna happen.

34:57.743 --> 34:59.144
Yeah. I'm going.

35:01.180 --> 35:02.414
What happened
to all that wisdom

35:02.481 --> 35:03.381
about you and Mike
having different priorities?

35:03.449 --> 35:04.416
Well, screw wisdom!

35:06.185 --> 35:08.219
I belong out there
with him --

35:08.287 --> 35:10.121
For better or worse.

35:10.189 --> 35:12.257
It's probably gonna be
for worse.

35:12.325 --> 35:14.159
Well, I knew that
the moment I met him.

35:15.294 --> 35:16.628
Goodbye, Jesse!

35:47.326 --> 35:49.394
What the hell
are you doing here?!

35:49.462 --> 35:51.229
What does it look like?

36:21.527 --> 36:23.862
You know, I'm tired of you
making all the decisions

36:23.929 --> 36:24.863
in this relationship.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.533
What do you got?

36:28.601 --> 36:30.101
Half a clip.

36:32.271 --> 36:33.271
Quarter clip.

36:37.343 --> 36:38.843
Out.

36:42.648 --> 36:44.215
Get the rest of the team.
We're going in.

36:55.094 --> 36:56.227
Is this thing
ready to go?

36:57.396 --> 36:58.963
Fi...

36:59.031 --> 37:00.398
You don't
have to be here.

37:00.466 --> 37:02.634
You know, you --
what, run?

37:02.701 --> 37:04.369
Oh, come on, Michael.

37:04.437 --> 37:06.004
You saw the pattern
of fire out there.

37:06.072 --> 37:07.072
I wouldn't make it
10 feet.

37:08.107 --> 37:09.040
There.

37:10.276 --> 37:11.376
When it's time...

37:11.444 --> 37:13.011
We'll do this together.

37:17.349 --> 37:20.518
I was always so much better
with explosives than you.

37:49.014 --> 37:50.048
Everybody down!

37:50.116 --> 37:52.817
Get that gun
off my face!

37:52.885 --> 37:54.152
You have
no authority here!

37:57.156 --> 37:59.991
Say another word.
I dare you.

38:00.059 --> 38:01.226
Mike!

38:01.293 --> 38:03.094
You in there?!

38:14.306 --> 38:17.375
It's too bad, really, Westen.
We could have been a good team.

38:19.578 --> 38:21.880
I already have a team.

38:21.947 --> 38:24.816
It's not as bad
as it looks.

38:24.884 --> 38:26.351
Thank you.

38:26.418 --> 38:28.386
For what, getting knocked
in the head?

38:30.589 --> 38:34.159
I'm fine, Michael.
I promise.

38:34.226 --> 38:35.693
Go see your friends.

38:42.201 --> 38:44.202
So, anyway,
I was checking to see

38:44.270 --> 38:47.071
if there was any kind of unusual
emergency activity in the area.

38:47.139 --> 38:48.806
Heard about a little
training exercise,

38:48.874 --> 38:50.041
and I figured you guys
would be here.

38:50.109 --> 38:51.409
What about the troops?

38:51.477 --> 38:55.113
Oh, uh, you can thank
Congressman Cowley for that.

38:55.181 --> 38:56.915
Hold up on that, man.
I got to be conscious for this.

38:56.982 --> 38:57.916
I got to tell you something.

38:57.983 --> 38:58.750
What is it?

38:58.817 --> 39:00.018
Your girlfriend...

39:02.021 --> 39:03.087
...Is crazy about you.

39:03.155 --> 39:04.522
You take care of her.
All right?

39:06.058 --> 39:07.358
Mr. Westen?

39:07.426 --> 39:09.861
We need you to come
with us.

39:09.929 --> 39:11.629
Am I under arrest?

39:11.697 --> 39:13.198
We're not
with the police.

39:13.265 --> 39:14.599
The car's waiting.

39:14.667 --> 39:15.800
What's this about?

39:15.868 --> 39:17.268
Just want to ask you
some questions.

39:27.046 --> 39:28.780
Let's go.

39:36.613 --> 39:39.677
<i>As a spy, you are trained
to deal with interrogation.</i>

39:40.025 --> 39:42.427
<i>You have to learn to let
the disorientation,</i>

39:42.495 --> 39:45.130
<i>the sleep deprivation,
and the brutal isolation</i>

39:45.197 --> 39:47.065
<i>just wash over you</i>

39:47.133 --> 39:49.234
<i>and try not to go insane.</i>

39:49.301 --> 39:50.368
<i>In the end, though,</i>

39:50.436 --> 39:51.870
<i>it's not so much
the questioning</i>

39:51.937 --> 39:53.605
<i>as the uncertainty
that gets to you --</i>

39:53.672 --> 39:55.874
<i>not knowing
what the future holds</i>

39:55.941 --> 39:57.475
<i>or if you have
a future at all.</i>

39:57.543 --> 39:59.043
Where are we going?

39:59.111 --> 40:01.212
We're not authorized
to answer questions.

40:04.250 --> 40:07.485
Give me a hint.
Prison? Execution?

40:07.553 --> 40:09.687
Warmer? Colder?

40:14.260 --> 40:16.694
You had me in a box answering
your questions for a week,

40:16.762 --> 40:18.229
and you can't answer
<i>one</i> of mine?

40:18.297 --> 40:19.697
Sorry.

40:21.667 --> 40:24.302
How about this?

40:24.370 --> 40:26.237
Can I have some water?

40:26.305 --> 40:27.939
No.

40:28.007 --> 40:30.575
"No."

41:22.628 --> 41:23.761
You.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.230
Michael.

41:28.534 --> 41:30.235
Welcome back.
