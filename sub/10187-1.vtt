06:48.993 --> 06:49.993
How are you?

06:53.382 --> 06:55.502
Didn't we just talk about that?

06:57.302 --> 06:58.302
That was yesterday.

06:59.921 --> 07:01.471
Today is Tuesday.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.120
So I've been here long?

07:09.990 --> 07:10.990
A month.

07:15.589 --> 07:16.849
Wayne Says

07:19.188 --> 07:21.988
My grief pattern is atypical

07:27.037 --> 07:28.037
Yeah

07:33.866 --> 07:35.096
Got to talk with Wayne.

07:36.815 --> 07:39.635
I think he gives too much medication
Way too much

07:41.275 --> 07:42.614
Stop it, please.

07:43.574 --> 07:45.674
trust on this to be smarter than you.

07:46.084 --> 07:48.773
He strayed out of medical school
He don't know what he's doing

07:49.013 --> 07:51.573
I've treated ten tenths
as many patients as he has

07:54.103 --> 07:55.412
But you're not a doctor.

07:56.962 --> 07:57.962
No, I'm not

07:59.342 --> 08:02.031
And I'm proud that I'm not a doctor like him.

08:04.481 --> 08:05.481
There is nothing...

08:05.921 --> 08:07.581
atypical about your grief

08:18.159 --> 08:19.539
It was my fault.

08:22.748 --> 08:23.748
What about me?

08:24.378 --> 08:25.378
I was there too.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.327
I could have stopped him.

08:29.077 --> 08:30.077
No.

08:33.716 --> 08:34.936
You didn't know that he...

08:34.956 --> 08:36.936
Started waking up lately

08:41.905 --> 08:44.135
I was aware that he would sometimes...

08:45.005 --> 08:46.004
wake up

08:48.244 --> 08:49.974
And crawl out of bed

08:51.154 --> 08:52.213
And walk about

08:54.463 --> 08:57.133
Just as you thought that
he was soundly asleep

08:58.182 --> 08:59.972
He could open the baby gate

09:02.512 --> 09:03.512
He...

09:03.992 --> 09:04.991
He woke up...

09:08.891 --> 09:09.891
And w...

09:10.031 --> 09:12.170
Was confused

09:20.269 --> 09:21.269
Hey!

09:42.335 --> 09:44.045
Dr. Wayne says he won't be back home.

09:48.484 --> 09:50.274
You couldn't leave it, could you?

09:50.684 --> 09:51.884
You had to mettle.

09:51.904 --> 09:53.354
This place leads nowhere.

09:54.773 --> 09:55.773
On the contrary...

09:57.543 --> 09:58.543
Grief

10:00.882 --> 10:02.167
It's not a disease...

10:02.202 --> 10:04.202
It's a natural healthy reaction.

10:04.402 --> 10:06.132
You can't just remove it
You mustn't...

10:08.181 --> 10:09.981
Wayne knows you're a therapist

10:11.161 --> 10:13.211
He said you shouldn't treat your own family

10:13.910 --> 10:15.310
In principle I agree, but...

10:16.290 --> 10:18.240
But you're just so much smarter

10:18.630 --> 10:19.629
Aren't you?

10:21.509 --> 10:22.509
I love you.

10:25.729 --> 10:28.418
Nothing hurts more than
to see the one thy in love...

10:29.448 --> 10:31.458
Subjected to mistakes and wrongs

10:33.137 --> 10:36.087
No therapist can know
as much about you as I do

12:51.655 --> 12:53.405
- It hurts.
- I know.

12:55.765 --> 12:56.765
There's no way around it.

13:02.034 --> 13:03.123
I want to talk to...

13:03.283 --> 13:05.123
I'm not gonna let you do that.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.252
Why not just go all alone?

13:12.872 --> 13:13.872
No.

13:14.512 --> 13:15.512
A little change.

13:18.261 --> 13:19.901
Wouldn't get any worse...

13:22.020 --> 13:23.020
Yes, it will.

13:44.767 --> 13:46.817
You're always been distant from me and Nick

13:49.686 --> 13:51.536
Ever I come to think of it

13:52.476 --> 13:53.855
Very very distant

13:56.135 --> 13:57.135
Okay

13:58.095 --> 14:00.064
Can you give me some examples
from this?

14:03.254 --> 14:05.244
Hell, That's not that difficult to understand.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.233
I've lost someone, for instance...

14:14.332 --> 14:16.012
You terribly distant lost someone

14:18.671 --> 14:19.671
As a father...

14:20.321 --> 14:21.431
And as a husband.

14:23.131 --> 14:24.751
And that was Nick's last summer

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
you missed that on

14:27.550 --> 14:28.550
Too bad

14:33.049 --> 14:34.649
I never interested you.

14:35.789 --> 14:36.789
Until now.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.218
That I'm your patient.

14:41.898 --> 14:44.457
Perhaps I'm not supposed
to talk about these things

14:45.547 --> 14:47.037
There is nothing you can't talk about

14:50.986 --> 14:54.116
You are indifferent
to whether your child is alive or dead

15:02.465 --> 15:05.364
I bet you have a lot of
clever therapist replies to that.

15:05.864 --> 15:06.864
Haven't you?

15:12.473 --> 15:13.473
Well, actually...

15:15.682 --> 15:16.591
It was to...

15:16.592 --> 15:17.592
Honor your wish.

15:18.372 --> 15:19.612
You wanted peace to write.

15:21.382 --> 15:22.431
Perhaps I didn't mean it

15:24.151 --> 15:25.381
What I understood...

15:27.171 --> 15:28.720
Is that you want me to ride alone

15:30.060 --> 15:32.180
That you and Nick,
were going to go to Eden.

15:32.460 --> 15:33.460
Just the two of you

15:34.319 --> 15:36.409
That way
you could finish your thesis

15:39.579 --> 15:40.578
But I didn't

15:42.688 --> 15:43.688
You didn't?

15:44.568 --> 15:45.568
You see?

15:46.158 --> 15:47.207
You didn't even know that.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.757
Why did you give up?
That's not like you

15:50.247 --> 15:53.256
The hope project Just seemed...
Less important upthere.

15:54.806 --> 15:57.276
As you said,
When I like told you about my subject...

15:58.026 --> 15:59.026
Glib

15:59.615 --> 16:01.085
I never called your subject glib

16:02.025 --> 16:04.115
Perhaps you didn't use that word,
but that's what you meant.

16:05.554 --> 16:07.394
And all of a sudden
It was glib

16:11.224 --> 16:13.513
Or even was...
some kind of lie.

16:14.253 --> 16:15.253
I see

16:16.533 --> 16:17.533
No, You don't see.

16:18.752 --> 16:19.782
You see a lot of things

16:20.022 --> 16:21.022
But not that.

17:50.078 --> 17:52.357
Inhale...
On a count of five

17:54.167 --> 17:55.517
Call me, call me.

17:55.677 --> 17:58.676
Just... Follow me...

17:58.746 --> 18:00.376
Do it with me... Inhale...

18:00.406 --> 18:01.535
Inhale...

18:01.536 --> 18:02.866
on a count to five...

18:04.786 --> 18:06.995
Inhale... Two

18:11.294 --> 18:12.294
Stay with me...

18:12.514 --> 18:14.754
Stay with me...
I'm Gonna teach you how to breathe.

18:15.474 --> 18:16.474
Inhale...

18:17.543 --> 18:18.983
2... 3...

18:19.233 --> 18:20.843
4, 5, hold.

18:22.333 --> 18:23.738
2... 3...

18:23.773 --> 18:26.482
4, 5, exhale...

18:27.002 --> 18:28.002
Good.

18:28.142 --> 18:29.142
Imagine...

18:29.562 --> 18:31.371
Imagine you're blowing on your...

18:31.591 --> 18:33.981
Vessel plumbs

18:34.631 --> 18:36.091
Calmly, quietly...

18:39.500 --> 18:41.210
Yes, yes, that's good.

18:41.770 --> 18:42.769
That's good.

18:47.299 --> 18:48.299
That's very good.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.888
I told you there would be a change.

18:53.118 --> 18:55.457
You're still mourning
but you're in a new phase.

19:01.726 --> 19:02.700
What phase?

19:02.701 --> 19:03.701
Anxiety.

19:05.786 --> 19:06.786
Anxiety.

19:06.896 --> 19:07.895
Yes

19:08.915 --> 19:09.965
This is physical.

19:13.895 --> 19:14.984
It's dangerous.

19:15.074 --> 19:16.204
No, it's not dangerous.

19:17.584 --> 19:19.794
Just as your grief wasn't dangerous

19:21.083 --> 19:22.613
a main part of anxiety

19:22.873 --> 19:23.873
Is physical

19:24.293 --> 19:25.533
Dizzy spells

19:26.523 --> 19:27.522
Dry mouth...

19:28.492 --> 19:29.952
misguided hearing...

19:30.342 --> 19:31.342
Trembling

19:31.652 --> 19:33.071
Heavy breathing...

19:33.161 --> 19:34.361
Less pulse...

19:34.651 --> 19:35.651
Nausea...

19:46.139 --> 19:47.139
Hey!

19:53.608 --> 19:54.597
Easy...

19:54.598 --> 19:56.098
Never screw your therapist.

19:57.308 --> 19:59.447
No matter how much
your therapist may like it

20:02.157 --> 20:03.727
I know that distracts you, but...

20:04.606 --> 20:05.606
It's not good for us.

20:06.046 --> 20:07.046
Do the breathing.

20:09.020 --> 20:10.888
Hold

20:12.995 --> 20:13.995
Exhale

20:15.466 --> 20:16.337
You love me?

20:17.424 --> 20:18.424
Yes, I do

20:21.512 --> 20:22.472
Then help me.

20:26.901 --> 20:27.724
It's what I'm doing

20:35.522 --> 20:36.521
Exposure

20:37.271 --> 20:39.931
That's the only thing that really works...

20:41.021 --> 20:42.619
Everything else is...

20:42.620 --> 20:43.620
Just talk

20:45.292 --> 20:49.168
You have to have the courage
to stay in the situation that frightens you.

20:50.281 --> 20:52.575
And then you'll learn
that fear isn't dangerous.

20:55.156 --> 20:57.141
Let's make a list of things
you're afraid of.

20:58.568 --> 21:01.335
In the top
You put the situation you fear the most

21:07.425 --> 21:09.107
But I don't know
what I'm afraid of

21:11.896 --> 21:14.895
Just... take your time.

21:16.850 --> 21:17.660
I'm thinking.

21:18.105 --> 21:19.105
Okay

21:25.771 --> 21:27.110
I'm thinking, but...

21:29.857 --> 21:33.140
Can't I just be afraid
without a definite object?

22:31.813 --> 22:32.813
No, no!

23:15.686 --> 23:17.326
This won't do

23:21.635 --> 23:23.926
Stupe Stupidest thing I could do to you

23:29.529 --> 23:30.763
If you can't tell me...

23:32.463 --> 23:33.813
What your fear's of.

23:34.254 --> 23:36.231
Maybe it would be easier for you to tell me

23:36.603 --> 23:37.953
Where you're afraid?

23:38.623 --> 23:41.050
Where would you feel most exposed?

23:43.529 --> 23:44.716
What would be the worst place?

23:48.021 --> 23:49.121
An apartment?

23:53.940 --> 23:54.940
The street?

23:56.280 --> 23:57.279
A store?

24:00.079 --> 24:01.079
The park?

24:05.013 --> 24:06.182
Listening to someone, maybe.

24:18.346 --> 24:19.572
The woods.

24:21.464 --> 24:22.555
The woods?

24:27.255 --> 24:28.255
The woods, yes.

24:28.295 --> 24:30.004
It's funny because...

24:30.184 --> 24:32.814
you were the one that always wanted
to go into the woods

24:35.278 --> 24:41.370
What scares you about the woods?
What frightens you... there?

24:45.052 --> 24:46.052
Everything

24:52.648 --> 24:55.396
Tell me what you think
is supposed to happen in the woods.

25:02.989 --> 25:03.989
Eh?

25:06.452 --> 25:08.082
Is it any woods in particular?

25:15.287 --> 25:16.326
Eden.

25:16.327 --> 25:17.827
Eden?

25:23.028 --> 25:25.131
What do you say we put...

25:26.505 --> 25:30.305
A garden round Eden
at the top of the pyramid?

25:32.454 --> 25:33.454
No.

25:34.274 --> 25:35.764
Not quite at the top.

25:47.142 --> 25:48.142
No.

25:57.760 --> 25:58.760
Okay

26:14.958 --> 26:16.657
It's... It's okay

26:16.658 --> 26:18.658
- I'm sorry
- It's okay

27:00.077 --> 27:01.974
We can start by working on your expectations

27:03.460 --> 27:04.620
Close your eyes.

27:10.079 --> 27:12.258
Feel the seat underneath you.

27:14.986 --> 27:17.376
Feel yourself sinking down into it

27:18.694 --> 27:19.772
Folding you...

27:21.656 --> 27:22.555
It's a nice feeling.

27:25.304 --> 27:27.530
What you feel is a pleasant warmth

27:28.388 --> 27:29.599
and heaviness

27:32.399 --> 27:34.274
your breath... is deep

27:36.255 --> 27:40.654
I gather
You sink...

27:41.384 --> 27:42.384
Down...

27:43.951 --> 27:45.222
Imagine you're at Eden.

27:47.434 --> 27:50.050
Imagine you arrived
at Eden through the woods.

27:53.662 --> 27:55.222
Tell me what you see?

28:01.121 --> 28:02.470
I'm at the bridge.

28:04.254 --> 28:05.278
It's evening

28:08.000 --> 28:09.849
Almost no voice can be heard.

28:12.290 --> 28:14.087
The water is running without a sound.

28:17.554 --> 28:19.637
Darkness comes out anytime here

28:22.487 --> 28:23.637
I walk into it

28:37.557 --> 28:39.905
The little deers... are hiding.

28:39.940 --> 28:42.704
Among their friends. As usual.

28:44.634 --> 28:47.013
Is it Difficult to go upthere?

28:48.373 --> 28:49.373
No.

28:50.163 --> 28:51.163
Not really.

28:53.312 --> 28:54.992
That is almost okay

29:04.781 --> 29:06.490
In a mountain of trees...

29:07.784 --> 29:08.727
Almosty

29:10.613 --> 29:12.246
There's a built foxhole

29:16.446 --> 29:17.646
How do you feel there?

29:21.108 --> 29:22.148
I can't really tell.

29:24.247 --> 29:25.537
It should be easy...

29:25.572 --> 29:26.647
passing

29:27.787 --> 29:28.817
And yet...

29:29.907 --> 29:31.726
It's like walking through mud.

29:42.585 --> 29:43.524
The trunk is thick

29:47.064 --> 29:48.744
the dear old ****

29:51.403 --> 29:54.143
It has some strange kind of personality.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.332
I've always found that.

30:03.971 --> 30:05.041
No.

30:06.901 --> 30:09.580
Where are you, are you...?
Are you heading for the cabin?

30:12.790 --> 30:13.820
Yes, I am

30:17.539 --> 30:19.589
I'm walking up above...

30:20.179 --> 30:21.728
Through the tall grass...

30:22.108 --> 30:23.088
Then don't come in.

30:24.198 --> 30:25.088
Don't go in.

30:27.017 --> 30:28.617
You see outside you're afraid of

30:28.637 --> 30:29.767
Don't look around...

30:30.977 --> 30:32.137
No.

30:33.286 --> 30:34.706
Lie down on the green.

30:38.096 --> 30:39.495
You want me to lie down?

30:39.695 --> 30:41.215
Lie down on the grass.

30:44.695 --> 30:46.384
On top of all the plants?

30:46.419 --> 30:48.074
Yes, lie down on the plants.

31:02.322 --> 31:03.282
Are you lying down?

31:05.401 --> 31:06.341
Yes

31:08.331 --> 31:09.251
Good

31:09.911 --> 31:11.390
What is everything like around you?

31:14.300 --> 31:15.260
Green.

31:16.730 --> 31:18.249
It's all very green.

31:20.939 --> 31:21.749
Good

31:23.978 --> 31:25.728
Now will you do what I ask you?

31:28.408 --> 31:29.238
Yes

31:30.297 --> 31:31.477
What do you want me to do?

31:34.247 --> 31:35.257
I want you...

31:36.716 --> 31:38.526
To melt... into the green.

31:40.446 --> 31:41.436
Don't fight it.

31:42.835 --> 31:43.835
Just...

31:44.015 --> 31:45.565
Turn green.

31:55.113 --> 31:57.293
No matter what happens
you were there. You did it.

32:00.593 --> 32:02.492
Let fear come, if it likes.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.022
Remember.

32:04.222 --> 32:07.022
But the mind can concieve
and believe it can achieve

32:58.663 --> 32:59.633
What's wrong?

33:00.503 --> 33:01.633
Ground is burning.

33:02.793 --> 33:04.262
The ground is not burning.

33:09.872 --> 33:10.771
Gotta go.

33:30.698 --> 33:31.708
I want to lie down.

33:32.878 --> 33:33.708
Just for a minute.

33:36.527 --> 33:37.487
Sure.

33:38.697 --> 33:39.727
Yea. We'll take a rest.

36:08.963 --> 36:10.013
Shouldn't we go home?

36:17.252 --> 36:18.272
Yeah

36:20.441 --> 36:21.381
Yeah, we should.

37:27.781 --> 37:28.730
Scared?

37:32.140 --> 37:33.170
Stay awake for me.

37:38.869 --> 37:39.769
Relax

37:40.818 --> 37:42.678
Stay... stay in there.

40:47.729 --> 40:50.068
It's just stupid acorns

42:19.474 --> 42:20.414
What are you doing?

42:21.374 --> 42:22.314
I'm just...

42:23.993 --> 42:26.983
Setting up... a little exercise.

42:28.493 --> 42:30.792
It's... It's like a...

42:33.102 --> 42:34.262
It's like a game.

42:34.632 --> 42:36.012
You cheated me yesterday.

42:37.081 --> 42:38.261
Running is not good.

42:38.521 --> 42:40.901
...You have to
really feel the grass.

42:42.241 --> 42:43.720
I want you to go from this stone...

42:45.760 --> 42:47.000
To this stone.

42:48.789 --> 42:50.149
Pretty scary, huh?

42:51.519 --> 42:52.439
You're ready?

42:54.079 --> 42:55.019
Yea

42:55.958 --> 42:56.948
I'll give you a ride.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.238
I'll put you on the first stone.

43:03.167 --> 43:04.657
Stay with me

43:06.167 --> 43:06.977
Here we go

43:07.517 --> 43:09.116
Put your foot down
I got you.

43:09.616 --> 43:11.336
I got you
I'm right here.

43:12.106 --> 43:13.136
I can't do this.

43:13.171 --> 43:14.355
Yes, you can.

43:15.035 --> 43:16.585
You can and you will.

43:16.735 --> 43:17.965
Just like I will.

43:18.115 --> 43:19.965
We're gonna walk together.

43:20.234 --> 43:21.614
We're gonna walk together, okay?

43:21.649 --> 43:22.744
Now...

43:23.184 --> 43:24.744
Alright now, Breathe.

43:25.454 --> 43:26.743
Let's step off the rock.

43:27.613 --> 43:29.283
And step on that grass.

43:30.303 --> 43:31.163
Step down

43:31.683 --> 43:34.042
See?... What happened?

43:34.372 --> 43:36.402
Keep breathing...
See? Keep breathing

43:36.472 --> 43:38.112
I've got you

43:38.147 --> 43:39.751
You're really doing great

43:39.791 --> 43:41.921
Okay?... keep breathing.

43:41.956 --> 43:44.051
Five, five and five.

43:47.910 --> 43:48.980
You're almost there.

43:49.750 --> 43:51.480
You're almost there
You're doing great

43:54.469 --> 43:55.649
...Five.

44:00.568 --> 44:02.228
We're there... We are there

44:02.338 --> 44:03.278
Here, told you

44:08.447 --> 44:09.607
You did it

44:13.196 --> 44:14.226
You learned something.

44:16.885 --> 44:18.025
Didn't you?

44:22.525 --> 44:23.504
You did beautiful.

44:25.644 --> 44:26.634
You did beautiful.

45:16.246 --> 45:17.776
I miss him so much...

45:38.033 --> 45:39.712
I've been afraid of here before.

45:41.742 --> 45:43.562
Yes, it seems likely.

45:45.981 --> 45:47.491
I just didn't know it was fear.

45:52.970 --> 45:56.470
I became afraid
... and I stopped writing.

45:59.069 --> 46:01.259
What was different... the last time?

46:07.588 --> 46:08.638
I heard a sound.

46:29.724 --> 46:30.684
Nick?

46:34.054 --> 46:35.213
Nick!

46:41.832 --> 46:42.922
Nick!

46:52.821 --> 46:53.651
Nick!

47:00.160 --> 47:00.989
Nick!

48:04.789 --> 48:06.289
You didn't hear Nick screaming.

48:10.528 --> 48:11.718
Apparently not.

48:12.218 --> 48:15.762
And because you experienced
something that you can't explain rationally,

48:15.797 --> 48:18.307
You placed
Eden very high on the pyramid chart.

48:23.856 --> 48:26.396
Eden was the catalyst
that triggered your fear.

48:26.676 --> 48:28.395
You jumped to conclusions.

48:29.055 --> 48:31.425
Entitled the emotional event with a place.

48:33.195 --> 48:35.444
When you feel threat
It's natural to react.

48:36.204 --> 48:37.604
If the danger were real...

48:37.954 --> 48:39.434
Your fear would save your life.

48:39.764 --> 48:43.273
Because your adrenaline will be used
for fight or flight.

48:45.033 --> 48:47.722
But what you're experiencing
is panic, nothing more.

48:49.162 --> 48:50.532
The scream wasn't real

49:01.480 --> 49:02.550
Stop!

49:05.630 --> 49:07.229
Calm down.

49:08.149 --> 49:09.589
You shouldn't have come here.

49:11.209 --> 49:13.388
You're just so damn arrogant.

49:15.448 --> 49:17.088
But this may not last.

49:18.937 --> 49:20.117
Have you thought of that?

49:31.525 --> 49:34.515
Oak trees grow to be hundreds of years old

49:36.135 --> 49:39.824
They only have to produce
one single tree, every hundred years.

49:40.334 --> 49:41.824
In order to perpetuate...

49:42.344 --> 49:43.823
May sound benign to you but...

49:44.453 --> 49:47.933
It was a big thing for me to realize that
when I was out here with Nick.

49:54.352 --> 49:56.601
The acorns fell on the roof then too...

49:58.591 --> 50:01.351
Kept falling, and falling

50:02.750 --> 50:04.970
And dying... and dying.

50:10.769 --> 50:12.139
And I understood that...

50:14.659 --> 50:17.598
Everything that used to be beautiful about Eden

50:18.958 --> 50:20.468
Was perhaps hideous

50:23.657 --> 50:27.527
Now I could hear
what I couldn't hear before.

50:30.866 --> 50:34.575
The cry of... all the things that are to die

50:39.515 --> 50:40.544
It's all...

50:41.614 --> 50:42.704
very touching

50:44.044 --> 50:45.914
If it was a children's book.

50:49.703 --> 50:51.333
acorns don't cry

50:53.232 --> 50:54.812
You know that as well as I do.

50:55.882 --> 50:57.362
That's what fear is.

50:58.832 --> 51:01.341
Your thoughts distort reality.

51:03.031 --> 51:04.531
Look the other way around...

51:10.690 --> 51:12.089
Satan's Church

51:12.124 --> 51:13.489
Satan?... Jesus!

51:13.910 --> 51:15.382
Nature is Satan's Church.

51:17.319 --> 51:18.248
What?

51:21.708 --> 51:23.018
Well, there you have him

51:24.857 --> 51:26.037
That was his brother.

51:57.142 --> 51:57.972
Nick?

51:59.742 --> 52:01.772
He drifted away from me the last time.

52:04.611 --> 52:07.251
He was always out and about...

52:07.861 --> 52:10.960
He might have made more of an effort
to be there for me.

54:10.421 --> 54:11.901
You look like you slept well.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.400
Thanks, I did.

54:21.319 --> 54:24.029
I just wanted to say how happy
I am that you're here...

54:28.118 --> 54:29.158
I love you darling...

54:38.537 --> 54:40.566
Did you have a good sleep?

54:42.836 --> 54:44.326
I've just been having a lot of...

54:45.226 --> 54:46.325
crazy dreams...

54:47.555 --> 54:50.355
Dreams are of no interest
in modern psychology.

54:51.884 --> 54:53.454
Freud is dead, isn't he?

55:13.381 --> 55:14.581
What are you doing?

55:14.781 --> 55:16.011
Look!

55:18.560 --> 55:19.870
I'm well again.

55:28.639 --> 55:29.838
I'm cured.

55:32.198 --> 55:33.598
See? perfect.

55:36.977 --> 55:38.227
I'm fine.

55:45.046 --> 55:47.056
You can't just be happy for me, can you?

57:53.816 --> 57:56.875
Chaos... reigns

58:07.018 --> 58:10.907
Chapter Three: The despair

01:02:06.865 --> 01:02:08.745
I want to do one more excercise.

01:02:09.245 --> 01:02:10.575
It's like a role play.

01:02:12.564 --> 01:02:13.554
My role...

01:02:14.354 --> 01:02:15.474
Is..

01:02:16.064 --> 01:02:17.984
All the thoughts
that provoke your fear...

01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:19.983
Yours...

01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:21.303
is rational thinking.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:27.952
I am nature...

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.981
All the things that you call nature.

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:41.030
Okay Mr. Nature

01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:45.319
what do you want?

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.708
To hurt you as much as I can.

01:02:57.397 --> 01:02:58.297
How?

01:03:00.127 --> 01:03:01.287
How do you think?

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.025
By Frightening me?

01:03:13.785 --> 01:03:14.815
By killing you.

01:03:17.964 --> 01:03:19.274
Nature can't hurt me.

01:03:20.314 --> 01:03:22.133
You just told you're the green in the outside...

01:03:22.523 --> 01:03:24.133
No, I'm more than that.

01:03:26.963 --> 01:03:28.142
I don't understand.

01:03:30.342 --> 01:03:32.492
I'm outside, but also...

01:03:36.181 --> 01:03:37.121
within

01:03:39.761 --> 01:03:41.510
I'm nature of all human beings

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:44.440
Oh, That kind of nature.

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:51.149
The kind of nature that...

01:03:51.239 --> 01:03:55.278
Causes people do
the evil things against women

01:03:55.318 --> 01:03:57.088
That's exactly who I am.

01:03:57.618 --> 01:04:00.587
That kind of nature interested me a lot.

01:04:01.237 --> 01:04:02.507
When I was uphere

01:04:03.887 --> 01:04:06.746
That kind of nature
was the subject to my thesis...

01:04:09.896 --> 01:04:12.125
But you shouldn't underestimate Eden.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.205
What did Eden do?

01:04:17.195 --> 01:04:20.204
I discovered somethng else
in my material than I expected.

01:04:23.064 --> 01:04:25.313
If human nature is evil...

01:04:26.523 --> 01:04:28.133
Then that goes as well...

01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:30.133
That the nature...

01:04:31.112 --> 01:04:32.132
of the women.

01:04:34.912 --> 01:04:36.042
Female nature.

01:04:36.412 --> 01:04:38.561
The nature of all the sisters.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.760
Women do not
control their own bodies

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.510
Nature does.

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.830
I have it in writing in my books.

01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:51.759
The literature you used
in your office search...

01:04:51.909 --> 01:04:54.954
Was about evil things
committed against women.

01:04:54.989 --> 01:04:57.888
But you read it as proof
of the evil of women?

01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:01.917
You were supposed to be critical of those says
That was your thesis

01:05:02.697 --> 01:05:04.357
Instead you're embracing it

01:05:05.147 --> 01:05:06.607
Do you know what you're saying?

01:05:08.686 --> 01:05:09.756
Forget it.

01:05:10.456 --> 01:05:12.116
I do not know why I said it.

01:05:13.586 --> 01:05:15.375
It can't work anymore now.

01:05:27.103 --> 01:05:28.353
Hit me.

01:05:29.283 --> 01:05:30.223
What?

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.223
Hit me so it hurts...

01:05:32.913 --> 01:05:33.902
No.

01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:35.452
Hit me, please.

01:05:35.802 --> 01:05:36.742
No!

01:05:37.202 --> 01:05:38.882
I can't stand it

01:05:39.541 --> 01:05:40.881
I do not want to

01:05:41.001 --> 01:05:42.421
I do not want to...

01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:54.979
Then you don't love me.

01:05:58.219 --> 01:05:59.808
Okay

01:06:00.728 --> 01:06:02.078
Maybe I don't love you.

01:06:02.088 --> 01:06:02.998
Yeah

01:06:57.769 --> 01:06:59.019
Again...

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:00.899
Again.

01:07:05.948 --> 01:07:07.797
This is too from nature's spell...

01:07:08.197 --> 01:07:09.797
Could start a hail storm...

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.910
I'm not gonna continue this
if you don't listen to me.

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.859
Good... and evil.

01:07:59.449 --> 01:08:01.249
Have nothing to do with therapy.

01:08:03.409 --> 01:08:07.908
You know how many innocent women were
killed in the sixteenth century alone

01:08:08.058 --> 01:08:09.348
just for being women?

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.347
I'm sure you do... Many.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:14.657
Not because they were evil...

01:08:16.147 --> 01:08:17.015
I know.

01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:19.876
It's just sometimes I forget.

01:08:23.854 --> 01:08:26.805
The evil you talk about is an obsession.

01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:30.894
Obsessions never materialize.
It's a scientific fact.

01:08:32.163 --> 01:08:36.073
Anxieties can't trick you into doing things
you won't do otherwise...

01:08:36.108 --> 01:08:37.218
It's like hypnotizing you

01:08:37.252 --> 01:08:40.393
You can't be hypnotized into doin
something you wouldn't...

01:08:41.353 --> 01:08:43.612
Normally do.
Something against your nature.

01:08:46.362 --> 01:08:47.341
You understand me?

01:08:48.241 --> 01:08:49.551
Yeah, I think so.

01:08:49.731 --> 01:08:52.541
You think so?
You don't have to understand me, just trust me.

01:09:12.837 --> 01:09:13.886
What's this?

01:09:14.576 --> 01:09:16.828
It's from the medical officer
It's a copy of the autopsy report.

01:09:20.886 --> 01:09:21.866
The autopsy?

01:09:24.466 --> 01:09:26.145
They performed an autopsy?

01:09:26.995 --> 01:09:28.984
I didn't wanna tell you,
because you weren't feeling well.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:32.573
Well

01:09:32.703 --> 01:09:33.993
What did they find?

01:09:35.394 --> 01:09:36.834
Nothing that would have any...

01:09:37.203 --> 01:09:38.473
bearing on the case.

01:09:39.803 --> 01:09:41.263
The only abnormality

01:09:41.483 --> 01:09:43.898
in the victim is a slight deformity

01:09:43.933 --> 01:09:47.011
of the bones in his feet,
of an earlier date

01:09:49.002 --> 01:09:51.901
We did not attention a significance to this.

01:10:06.179 --> 01:10:09.429
You were rather to put Nick's shoes on
wrong in this picture?

01:10:15.238 --> 01:10:16.137
Well

01:10:18.337 --> 01:10:21.277
How I would?!

01:10:22.407 --> 01:10:23.876
A slip of the mind that day?

01:10:24.376 --> 01:10:25.296
I wish

01:11:33.175 --> 01:11:34.305
Herself.

01:11:37.984 --> 01:11:40.784
Bastard.
You're leaving me, aren't you?

01:11:42.434 --> 01:11:43.814
get off me, bastard.

01:11:45.103 --> 01:11:46.263
You're leaving me.

01:11:46.483 --> 01:11:47.533
I'm not.

01:11:47.813 --> 01:11:48.938
I'm helping you.

01:11:48.973 --> 01:11:50.632
- You're leaving me, aren't you?
- No!

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:07.080
- I love you.
- I don't believe you!

01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:08.260
Yes

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.029
I don't believe you!

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:12.030
I don't fucking believe you!

01:17:16.141 --> 01:17:17.261
Where are you?

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.170
You bastard!

01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:24.779
Where are you?

01:17:34.308 --> 01:17:35.288
Where are you?

01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:50.695
Where are you?

01:17:59.924 --> 01:18:00.894
Where are you?

01:18:06.743 --> 01:18:07.792
You bastard!

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:20.151
Where are you?

01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:24.770
Where are you?

01:18:29.179 --> 01:18:30.429
How dare you leave me?

01:18:42.147 --> 01:18:44.157
You said you wanted to help me.

01:18:45.856 --> 01:18:47.086
Where are you?

01:18:50.946 --> 01:18:51.885
Where are you?

01:20:14.662 --> 01:20:15.742
Where are you?

01:20:20.721 --> 01:20:21.901
You bastard!

01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:34.430
Get out!

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.749
Get out! You bastard!

01:21:38.279 --> 01:21:39.409
Get out!

01:21:41.319 --> 01:21:42.678
You bastard!

01:21:43.438 --> 01:21:44.508
Get out!

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:47.997
Get out!

01:22:08.454 --> 01:22:09.664
Get out!

01:22:11.894 --> 01:22:13.043
You bastard!

01:22:15.043 --> 01:22:16.093
Get out!

01:23:16.443 --> 01:23:17.483
Sorry.

01:24:03.986 --> 01:24:07.935
You gotta get this thing off... my leg

01:24:29.852 --> 01:24:31.062
I can't find the wrench.

01:25:36.281 --> 01:25:37.441
Did you want to kill me?

01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:40.301
Not yet

01:25:43.650 --> 01:25:45.310
The three beggars aren't here yet.

01:25:46.769 --> 01:25:47.809
The three beggars?

01:25:50.699 --> 01:25:51.749
What does that mean?

01:25:53.628 --> 01:25:55.338
When the three beggars arrive...

01:25:56.198 --> 01:25:57.338
Someone must die.

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:01.677
I see.

01:26:26.013 --> 01:26:28.423
The crying woman
is a scheming woman.

01:26:40.331 --> 01:26:43.740
False in legs
False in thighs

01:26:45.790 --> 01:26:49.420
False in breasts
Teeth, hair and eyes

01:28:41.642 --> 01:28:42.682
Hold me

01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:48.181
Hold me

01:30:12.687 --> 01:30:14.777
There is no such constellation.

01:30:42.462 --> 01:30:43.872
None of it is any use

01:30:44.162 --> 01:30:45.662
Not good.

01:30:51.651 --> 01:30:52.671
No!
