Hey, shout out to this dude right here.

01:48.291 --> 01:49.292
There's no one here.

01:50.458 --> 01:51.893
I didn't tell anybody.

01:53.496 --> 01:54.531
Understood.

01:55.797 --> 01:56.866
Can I give you a lift?

01:58.333 --> 02:00.903
No. I'm okay. I'll do it on my own.

02:02.205 --> 02:04.107
Have you decided what you're gonna do?

02:05.874 --> 02:07.409
Haven't even thought that far yet.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.848
Well, I wish you the best, Michael.

02:12.914 --> 02:14.016
You too, Warden.

02:31.166 --> 02:33.266
- How much?
- Three-fifty.

02:33.268 --> 02:35.269
Oh...

02:35.271 --> 02:37.140
- It's gone up.
- It has.

02:42.244 --> 02:43.845
Hey,

02:43.847 --> 02:45.415
didn't you use to play basketball?

02:46.214 --> 02:47.850
Yeah. Long time ago.

03:51.213 --> 03:53.180
Let's go!

03:53.182 --> 03:54.618
Where's your D at, bro?

03:56.486 --> 03:57.520
Yeah! Yo!

03:59.022 --> 04:00.123
Go, go, go!

04:56.412 --> 04:57.513
Hi, Mama.

05:00.448 --> 05:01.681
Michael.

05:01.683 --> 05:04.018
Why didn't you tell me you was out?

05:04.020 --> 05:05.953
- Why didn't you...
- I didn't want to bother you.

05:05.955 --> 05:08.955
- You just saw me last week.
- Oh, I could have met you.

05:08.957 --> 05:10.390
Don't worry. It's okay, Mama.

05:10.392 --> 05:12.525
You should have told
me. I would've met you.

05:12.527 --> 05:14.462
It's okay.

05:14.464 --> 05:16.496
You're like a changed man.

05:16.498 --> 05:18.064
I am.

05:18.066 --> 05:19.134
A changed man.

05:21.202 --> 05:22.539
Praise God.

05:27.075 --> 05:30.177
- So where's Taye?
- Taye? Well...

05:30.179 --> 05:33.115
Your little brother, he's not doing well.

05:34.183 --> 05:35.415
What does that mean?

05:35.417 --> 05:36.652
He's not doing well.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.453
Where is he?

05:40.724 --> 05:42.325
I don't know, he's out.

05:44.092 --> 05:46.494
Let me look at you.

05:46.496 --> 05:50.597
You look so healthy. I
prayed every day and night.

05:50.599 --> 05:53.633
Come on, you gonna stay
in your old bedroom.

05:53.635 --> 05:56.070
All right, Mom. Look,
just for a time, though.

05:56.072 --> 05:59.009
Oh, don't be silly. You gonna
stay there as long as you want.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.656
Here, son.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.124
- Take it.
- No, Ma.

06:18.126 --> 06:20.562
Look, I still got some money
that the prison gave me.

06:21.296 --> 06:22.729
It's okay.

06:22.731 --> 06:24.263
I'll make us some dinner.

06:24.265 --> 06:27.200
No, Ma. Ma. I already ate.

06:27.202 --> 06:29.736
Listen, I gotta go do some things,
but I'll be back, all right?

06:29.738 --> 06:30.740
Where you going?

06:32.609 --> 06:34.174
I gotta get a job.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.243
That can wait. You just got out.

06:36.245 --> 06:37.380
I'll be fine, Ma.

06:43.253 --> 06:45.018
Don't bug me with this nonsense.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.253
I told you already. How
many times I got to...

06:47.255 --> 06:49.092
Hey, man, have you seen Taye around?

06:49.724 --> 06:51.592
Michael!

06:51.594 --> 06:53.794
I'll call you back.

06:53.796 --> 06:56.397
- When did you get out of jail?
- Today.

06:56.399 --> 06:58.099
Welcome home.

06:58.101 --> 07:00.100
- Thank you, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:00.102 --> 07:01.437
No, I haven't seen him.

07:03.072 --> 07:06.109
All right. No worries. Take it easy.

07:17.053 --> 07:20.587
Jerry, some kid slipped and fell.
Aisle 9. The mom's pretty upset.

07:20.589 --> 07:22.258
Seriously? Did they get hurt?

07:24.125 --> 07:25.559
Hey, listen, I gotta go
take care of this thing.

07:25.561 --> 07:27.363
I don't have time to look at this.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.231
Not much experience, huh?

07:31.233 --> 07:32.602
Listen, I'd be a great worker.

07:34.503 --> 07:35.768
Okay. We'll give it a shot.

07:35.770 --> 07:37.236
All right. Great. When can I start?

07:37.238 --> 07:39.073
- You can start today.
- Now?

07:39.075 --> 07:41.211
- Yeah. Now.
- Okay.

07:45.580 --> 07:47.217
- Enjoy your day.
- You too.

08:02.864 --> 08:03.900
Taye, man!

08:05.200 --> 08:06.333
What up?

08:06.335 --> 08:08.835
Yo, what's up? When did you get out?

08:08.837 --> 08:10.571
Yesterday.

08:10.573 --> 08:11.608
Oh, all right.

08:13.775 --> 08:16.109
Man, I was wondering if we
could hang out after work?

08:16.111 --> 08:17.477
I just got this new job.

08:17.479 --> 08:18.714
Yeah. If I'm free.

08:21.217 --> 08:22.683
That's cool.

08:22.685 --> 08:24.518
Yeah, it's good seeing
you after all this time.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.589
Listen, uh, I gotta go, all right?

08:29.224 --> 08:30.426
All right, little bro.

08:31.693 --> 08:33.227
See you soon.

08:38.567 --> 08:39.802
I got the ball!

08:47.775 --> 08:49.442
Hey, guard George! Get George! Come on!

08:49.444 --> 08:51.744
- Come on, come on!
- Watch it! Watch it! Watch it!

08:51.746 --> 08:53.183
Whoo!

08:56.784 --> 08:58.188
On the ball!

09:02.290 --> 09:04.359
Here it comes, here it
comes. Here it comes.

09:06.261 --> 09:09.229
Whoo! That's game! That's right.

09:09.231 --> 09:10.400
All right, who's next?

09:13.236 --> 09:14.404
Hey, man. You play?

09:15.303 --> 09:16.603
It's been a while.

09:16.605 --> 09:18.205
That don't matter.

09:18.207 --> 09:19.442
- Come on.
- All right.

09:20.842 --> 09:23.210
- Yo, you gonna wear that, man?
- What?

09:23.212 --> 09:24.711
Your supermarket apron.

09:24.713 --> 09:25.778
Oh!

09:26.915 --> 09:28.481
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

09:28.483 --> 09:29.749
You sure you can play though, right?

09:29.751 --> 09:31.451
Like I said, it's been a while.

09:31.453 --> 09:32.819
What do you mean "been a while"?

09:32.821 --> 09:34.455
- I mean...
- Nah, it's all right. That's cool.

09:34.457 --> 09:36.726
We just need another guy.
We're all right. Ball up.

09:38.593 --> 09:40.259
Here we go.

09:40.261 --> 09:42.362
Shoot that! Shoot that!
Steal that! Steal that!

09:42.364 --> 09:43.600
I was open!

09:44.567 --> 09:45.735
I'm up!

09:50.972 --> 09:52.538
Deep! Deep! Deep! Deep!

09:52.540 --> 09:54.206
Deep! Deep! Deep!

09:54.208 --> 09:55.310
Deep!

10:03.619 --> 10:05.319
Come on, to the hoop!

10:05.321 --> 10:07.323
Man! Hey, come on, now.

10:08.323 --> 10:09.623
You straight? You straight?

10:09.625 --> 10:10.760
I'm feeling good, man. I'm good.

10:14.630 --> 10:17.665
Let's go! Pass the ball! Come on, man!

10:17.667 --> 10:20.466
Pass the ball! Go! He's open, he's open.

10:20.468 --> 10:23.336
- Damn.
- Yo! Yo, he was wide open. Come on, man!

10:23.338 --> 10:25.674
- Come on, man!
- I got you, I got you. I got you.

10:34.016 --> 10:35.782
- No way!
- That's game.

10:35.784 --> 10:38.284
- Well, where did that come from?
- I don't know.

10:38.286 --> 10:40.689
Yo, maybe he's LeBron in disguise.

10:41.957 --> 10:43.824
Dude, where did that come from, bro?

10:43.826 --> 10:45.258
I told you, I ain't played in a while.

10:45.260 --> 10:46.562
Yeah, right, not played in a while.

10:54.736 --> 10:56.936
Yo, how come we haven't
ever seen you before?

10:56.938 --> 10:59.773
- You just move here?
- Yeah.

10:59.775 --> 11:01.807
You must have played
some kind of college ball.

11:01.809 --> 11:04.479
- You just didn't come out of nowhere.
- He did.

11:05.648 --> 11:07.817
Brother played at USC, right?

11:09.617 --> 11:12.985
First team All-American.
Averaged 27 points per,

11:12.987 --> 11:16.288
and led USC to an NCAA tournament,

11:16.290 --> 11:17.891
then he got arrested.

11:17.893 --> 11:19.826
Good to see you too, Terrell.

11:19.828 --> 11:21.561
Oh, you played for USC?

11:21.563 --> 11:23.696
I think I remember you now!

11:23.698 --> 11:26.066
You got arrested for
robbing someone, right?

11:26.068 --> 11:27.970
Good to know some things never die.

11:29.571 --> 11:31.007
Yo, I'm sorry. Who are you?

11:31.807 --> 11:32.940
I'm an agent.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.308
- An agent?
- Yes. An agent.

11:35.310 --> 11:36.843
What are you doing here?

11:36.845 --> 11:38.744
I'm looking for the next big client.

11:38.746 --> 11:40.747
If it's any of your business.

11:40.749 --> 11:42.581
I'm your next big client.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.450
No, I don't think so.

11:44.452 --> 11:46.954
Well, you obviously never
seen me play then before, huh?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.058
- Am I right?
- I've seen you play.

11:49.924 --> 11:51.524
And?

11:51.526 --> 11:54.561
You have about as much
chance to make the NBA

11:54.563 --> 11:55.898
as that thing over there.

13:00.795 --> 13:02.529
Well, I didn't mean to.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.064
Why are you gonna stay at home?

13:04.066 --> 13:05.632
'Cause I'm tired.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.700
I just made that whole meal and I'm tired.

13:07.702 --> 13:09.069
Why are you acting like that?

13:09.071 --> 13:10.637
Because I'm old.

13:10.639 --> 13:13.072
- Mom...
- ...nothing to do. Come on.

13:13.074 --> 13:15.642
You know what, I'm tired.
I'm about to go to bed.

13:15.644 --> 13:17.576
But no...

13:21.983 --> 13:23.518
- Michael?
- Hi.

13:25.688 --> 13:26.789
When'd you get out?

13:27.521 --> 13:28.523
A few days ago.

13:32.794 --> 13:34.860
- Lisa?
- Yeah?

13:34.862 --> 13:36.832
- You got a visitor.
- Who?

13:40.968 --> 13:43.071
- Hi.
- Who is that?

13:44.573 --> 13:45.640
It's Michael.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.608
Michael?

13:48.610 --> 13:50.613
Michael, you remember Craig,

13:52.146 --> 13:53.613
right?

13:53.615 --> 13:56.486
- Man. When did you...
- A few days ago.

14:01.691 --> 14:04.157
Look, man, I know you feel some type of way

14:04.159 --> 14:06.558
because I ain't come see
you while you was in the pen.

14:06.560 --> 14:09.162
But, as you heard, I'm
playing in the League now.

14:09.164 --> 14:11.800
The schedule's kinda crazy.
You understand, right?

14:13.702 --> 14:16.036
Yeah, I understand.

14:16.038 --> 14:19.205
Hear you're doing good
too. Congratulations.

14:19.207 --> 14:21.206
Appreciate it.

14:21.208 --> 14:24.177
Anyways, we about to
head to the Clippers game,

14:24.179 --> 14:25.548
meet up with the homies.

14:26.715 --> 14:27.783
So we gonna roll.

14:28.949 --> 14:30.252
Nah. That's no worries, man.

14:31.819 --> 14:33.753
I just come by to say hi.

14:33.755 --> 14:36.223
- For sure.
- Michael...

14:36.225 --> 14:37.923
You living with your mom, now?

14:37.925 --> 14:39.194
Yeah, for the time being.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.961
That's great.

14:41.963 --> 14:44.633
Welcome back, though, man.
For real. It's good to see you.

14:45.634 --> 14:46.802
For real.

14:48.603 --> 14:49.771
Nice car.

14:50.938 --> 14:52.806
See you later.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.577
Michael, Merry Christmas.

15:05.821 --> 15:10.255
Lisa? Why is Michael showing
up over at your momma house?

15:10.257 --> 15:12.625
He was just saying hi.

15:12.627 --> 15:15.061
I haven't seen him in six years.

15:15.063 --> 15:17.263
Well, why are you
concerned with seeing him?

15:17.265 --> 15:19.766
Like, that's... That's the
part that's trippin' me out.

15:19.768 --> 15:22.701
Why do you care to see him? I'm your dude!

15:22.703 --> 15:24.171
He came to my house.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.107
That fool's crazy, man.

15:30.245 --> 15:31.945
Watch out, fool!

15:31.947 --> 15:34.317
What are you doing? What is wrong with you?

15:37.685 --> 15:39.186
Hey, Mr. Porter,

15:39.188 --> 15:42.721
Um, I was wondering, when
are our paychecks coming?

15:42.723 --> 15:44.858
Every two weeks.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.928
- Okay. Thanks.
- No problem.

15:51.632 --> 15:53.667
Is that you, Michael?

15:53.669 --> 15:54.834
Hi, Melinda.

15:54.836 --> 15:56.702
When did you get out?

15:56.704 --> 15:58.037
A few days ago.

15:58.039 --> 16:01.306
I tried my best to defend you, Michael.

16:01.308 --> 16:04.911
Sometimes the justice is dead on arrival.

16:04.913 --> 16:09.316
I truly lost my soul
when they took you away.

16:09.318 --> 16:11.784
Listen, you did the best you could do.

16:11.786 --> 16:13.221
So, that's all that matters.

16:15.122 --> 16:17.223
I gotta get back to work, so...

16:17.225 --> 16:18.628
It's good seeing you.

16:21.597 --> 16:22.698
See you.

16:32.674 --> 16:34.273
- Hey, man!
- What?

16:34.275 --> 16:35.341
You throwin' that out?

16:35.343 --> 16:36.878
Yeah. It's 30 days old, man.

16:38.078 --> 16:40.248
- Can I take it?
- Sure. Here.

16:42.884 --> 16:44.651
You feeding the birds?

16:44.653 --> 16:47.019
Uh, yeah, and the goldfish too.

16:47.021 --> 16:49.321
Well. Good luck, man.

16:49.323 --> 16:50.726
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

17:54.255 --> 17:57.223
<i>Next up is Michael Diggs from USC.</i>

17:57.225 --> 18:02.262
<i>He just needs one complete dunk
and he wins the competition!</i>

18:02.264 --> 18:04.263
<i>But he missed it!</i>

18:04.265 --> 18:06.933
<i>And the winner goes
to Craig Jackson.</i>

18:06.935 --> 18:09.735
<i>Michael Diggs is runner up!</i>

18:09.737 --> 18:12.738
Bro, what is you trippin' about?
So what was you tryin' to do?

18:12.740 --> 18:14.907
Like I said, I about to do this
dunk you ain't never seen before.

18:14.909 --> 18:16.443
That's your problem.

18:16.445 --> 18:18.811
You always tryin' to do
stuff you know you can't do.

18:18.813 --> 18:21.347
Yeah, no use of playing that over
and over again in your mind, Michael.

18:21.349 --> 18:23.483
You just lucky I ain't make that dunk.

18:23.485 --> 18:25.984
Right. So what was you tryin' to do again?

18:25.986 --> 18:28.988
Like I said, it's something
you ain't never seen before.

18:28.990 --> 18:32.425
Whatever. Look, you're good, bro.

18:32.427 --> 18:34.927
You'll go number one in
the draft. You straight.

18:34.929 --> 18:37.130
You got your girl. I won the dunk contest.

18:37.132 --> 18:38.767
So, what? Let's keep it pushin'.

18:41.969 --> 18:44.439
Michael? Is everything all right?

18:46.140 --> 18:47.243
Yeah, Ma.

18:49.044 --> 18:50.478
Just reminiscing. That's all.

18:56.851 --> 18:59.351
See, if you don't show up,
I gotta give him the work.

18:59.353 --> 19:00.786
And do you want the work?

19:00.788 --> 19:02.321
- Run that. I need that.
- He's hungry.

19:02.323 --> 19:04.157
You acting like you ain't hungry right now.

19:04.159 --> 19:05.993
No, I swear, I'm on it, bro.

19:05.995 --> 19:07.263
Yo, what up, Taye?

19:08.863 --> 19:10.496
Michael Diggs.

19:10.498 --> 19:12.298
When they let you out?

19:12.300 --> 19:14.000
Couple days ago.

19:14.002 --> 19:16.837
Yo, that's one of the best
basketball players I ever seen.

19:16.839 --> 19:18.538
Twenty eight points per game, right?

19:18.540 --> 19:22.109
No, not anymore. Come on, man.

19:22.111 --> 19:24.209
Hey, Mike, if you need that
work, you know who to come see.

19:24.211 --> 19:25.544
No, I'm good. I got a job.

19:25.546 --> 19:28.514
Just letting you know.
We don't do drugs anymore.

19:28.516 --> 19:30.484
We're pushing guns now.

19:30.486 --> 19:33.054
Guns is the latest and greatest,
you know what I'm saying?

19:34.489 --> 19:36.455
I know you know what I'm sayin', but...

19:36.457 --> 19:39.224
Listen, we're not interested.

19:39.226 --> 19:42.228
- All right.
- Come on, man.

19:42.230 --> 19:44.397
Yo, Taye, just be on time, a'ight?

19:44.399 --> 19:47.032
- A'ight?
- Right.

19:47.034 --> 19:48.801
Yo, man. What are you doing, man?

19:48.803 --> 19:50.035
Yo, he giving me work.

19:50.037 --> 19:51.404
Yo, he's a gang member!

19:51.406 --> 19:53.042
Mama needs the money, fool!

19:54.042 --> 19:55.274
- What?
- Yeah.

19:55.276 --> 19:57.443
She's desperate. She needs the money.

19:57.445 --> 19:59.846
We don't need to make money like this, man.

19:59.848 --> 20:02.182
I just spent six years
in prison because of this.

20:02.184 --> 20:04.051
Don't that mean anything to you?

20:04.053 --> 20:06.352
You gonna do what with your
little grocery job, huh?

20:06.354 --> 20:07.389
Hmm?

20:09.890 --> 20:13.259
- I'm proud of my job, man.
- I'm sure.

20:13.261 --> 20:15.861
Listen, we don't got to
make money like this, man.

20:15.863 --> 20:17.863
Don't go down this road, bro.

20:17.865 --> 20:21.333
Look, don't talk to me like
you ain't served six years, huh!

20:21.335 --> 20:24.038
If I get hooked up, I
won't get caught like you.

20:25.407 --> 20:26.609
<i>Mom!</i>

20:35.316 --> 20:36.517
Man alive.

20:43.025 --> 20:44.293
Why didn't you tell me?

20:45.427 --> 20:48.094
A $2,300 hospital bill?

20:48.096 --> 20:50.929
I didn't want to give you grief, son.

20:50.931 --> 20:52.298
You just got out of prison.

20:53.435 --> 20:55.104
Look, Mom...

20:56.004 --> 20:57.936
I'll work two jobs.

20:57.938 --> 20:59.207
You know, don't worry.

21:00.108 --> 21:01.176
We'll do this.

21:02.143 --> 21:03.444
God will be with us, son.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.023
Mom?

21:15.290 --> 21:16.392
Are you all right?

21:17.124 --> 21:19.292
I'm fine.

21:19.294 --> 21:21.229
Just working late at the nursing home.

21:22.096 --> 21:23.164
I'll be fine.

21:24.932 --> 21:26.398
Look, Mom,

21:26.400 --> 21:29.001
don't worry about anything, all right?

21:29.003 --> 21:30.339
You was always there for me.

21:32.107 --> 21:34.009
I'm gonna take care of you now, okay?

21:37.912 --> 21:40.280
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

21:40.282 --> 21:44.116
- You guys have any open shifts?
- Sorry, man, no.

21:44.118 --> 21:46.221
- All right. Thank you. No worries.
- Okay.

22:02.236 --> 22:04.238
<i>God will be with us, son.</i>

22:09.110 --> 22:11.010
- <i>Pick it up.</i>
- Hey, take it from him.

22:11.012 --> 22:12.014
Take it from him.

22:15.684 --> 22:17.186
You go!

22:23.257 --> 22:24.624
Ain't that Michael Diggs?

22:24.626 --> 22:25.992
Yeah, it is.

22:25.994 --> 22:27.362
I haven't seen him in years.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.336
Hey, Mike, join the game, man!

22:36.336 --> 22:37.503
Whoa!

22:37.505 --> 22:40.173
- Help me out!
- Oh, no! No!

22:40.175 --> 22:41.210
Ahhh!

23:05.332 --> 23:07.500
That's crazy! He still got the hops!

23:07.502 --> 23:09.601
- Where's he been?
- In jail.

23:09.603 --> 23:12.272
- Were you livin' in a cave?
- Jail? I didn't know.

23:20.015 --> 23:22.314
Two scores, Michael! Go!

23:26.454 --> 23:28.487
That's game!

23:28.489 --> 23:30.189
That's my boy!

23:30.191 --> 23:32.324
Michael Diggs, that's my boy!

23:32.326 --> 23:34.126
- That's my boy!
- Yeah!

23:34.128 --> 23:36.262
- Yeah.
- That's right.

23:36.264 --> 23:39.032
- All right.
- All right, who's next?

23:39.034 --> 23:40.135
I got next.

23:43.237 --> 23:44.803
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

23:44.805 --> 23:48.206
You must have the wrong
court. The YWCA is over there.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.648
- Hey, man. Let her play.
- Give me the ball.

23:54.248 --> 23:55.615
- Give me the ball!
- Her ball.

24:15.503 --> 24:16.705
Ooh!

24:17.505 --> 24:19.140
Yeah! Let's go!

24:32.352 --> 24:34.186
You go, Michael!

24:40.428 --> 24:41.563
Ooh!

24:46.266 --> 24:48.568
Oh! What's that? What's that?

24:48.570 --> 24:49.869
- Whoo!
- That's game, baby.

24:49.871 --> 24:51.571
That's right.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.908
Ooh!

24:54.409 --> 24:56.512
- You wanna go out sometime?
- No.

24:59.781 --> 25:02.148
- Yo, what's up?
- She said no.

25:02.150 --> 25:04.117
Bro, ask her again.

25:04.119 --> 25:06.351
Chicks dig it when you ask
her a second time, seriously.

25:06.353 --> 25:09.388
Go. Go. You got this.
Yeah, that's right. Uh-huh.

25:10.658 --> 25:12.660
Hey, you want to go out sometime on a date?

25:13.861 --> 25:16.698
Did you not hear me? I said, "No".

25:21.835 --> 25:23.535
She said, "No".

25:23.537 --> 25:26.138
You discouraged? Come on, bro. Come on.

25:26.140 --> 25:27.706
I saw her lookin' at you earlier.

25:27.708 --> 25:30.208
No, no, no.

25:30.210 --> 25:31.609
Go. You got this.

25:33.380 --> 25:35.417
Excuse me, do you want to go out sometime?

25:36.817 --> 25:38.318
Are you mentally ill?

25:40.621 --> 25:42.423
I said, "No".

25:47.894 --> 25:49.396
Let's go.

25:49.398 --> 25:51.363
Gimme the ball. Come on, man.

25:51.365 --> 25:52.565
Give... Come on now.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.734
- Who has next?
- Who got next?

25:54.736 --> 25:56.369
Hold up, hold up, hold up!

25:56.371 --> 25:58.870
I don't want anybody talking
trash to this little guy!

25:58.872 --> 26:03.176
Anyone who makes one little
tiny joke will answer to me!

26:03.178 --> 26:04.944
You wanna be on my team, little fella?

26:04.946 --> 26:06.481
Come on, man!

26:13.521 --> 26:14.923
Ooh!

26:29.638 --> 26:30.639
Oh!

26:35.976 --> 26:37.979
Yeah! Yeah.

26:55.429 --> 26:56.696
Watch him!

27:05.273 --> 27:06.371
Ooh!

27:06.373 --> 27:07.476
Game!

27:08.275 --> 27:09.407
Oh...

27:09.409 --> 27:11.679
Come on, man! Dang!

27:16.618 --> 27:18.517
Take that, little fella.

27:18.519 --> 27:20.054
Ohhoho!

27:22.689 --> 27:23.889
Little fella.

27:25.459 --> 27:26.694
Oh...

27:38.840 --> 27:40.375
Michael Diggs.

27:42.376 --> 27:43.842
How have you been?

27:43.844 --> 27:45.878
Been a long time since I've seen you.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.746
The last time I saw you, you
were in high school, Michael.

27:48.748 --> 27:50.416
Good to see you, Pastor Soul.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.784
Sorry, it's been so long.

27:52.786 --> 27:54.954
Been out of church for quite some time now.

27:54.956 --> 27:56.789
That is true.

27:56.791 --> 28:00.359
But the doors of this church
are always open for you, Michael.

28:00.361 --> 28:02.029
But if you are looking for redemption,

28:04.632 --> 28:06.000
you're not gonna find it here.

28:07.502 --> 28:10.369
You know? We could use your help.

28:10.371 --> 28:12.737
We need role models like you, Michael.

28:12.739 --> 28:14.305
Role model?

28:14.307 --> 28:16.442
Me, a role model?

28:16.444 --> 28:19.712
I'm a guy who spent six years behind bars.

28:19.714 --> 28:22.648
Look, I wanna help any way I can, but...

28:22.650 --> 28:25.384
I'm not ready for that yet.

28:25.386 --> 28:27.989
You are Michael Diggs. Or was I mistaken?

28:29.422 --> 28:30.691
- I was.
- Was?

28:31.592 --> 28:32.727
In another life.

28:33.326 --> 28:35.094
No.

28:35.096 --> 28:37.663
You are still Michael Diggs.

28:37.665 --> 28:39.799
I know you have been put through hell.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.466
But you came back.

28:41.468 --> 28:44.070
And you still have that
God-given talent and ability

28:44.072 --> 28:45.140
you always have had.

28:46.107 --> 28:48.040
Listen.

28:48.042 --> 28:51.843
You are not the only one who
has screwed up in this life.

28:51.845 --> 28:54.914
A lot of people have
screwed up worse than that,

28:54.916 --> 28:58.951
and they came back, stronger
and better than ever before.

28:58.953 --> 29:02.421
Now, let's... Let's fix this church up.

29:02.423 --> 29:03.724
Let's resurrect it.

29:05.759 --> 29:08.660
Do we have a deal?

29:08.662 --> 29:10.798
- Let's make it happen, preacher.
- Let's do it.

29:17.938 --> 29:19.705
Oh...

29:19.707 --> 29:21.543
Man, this place is nasty.

29:23.143 --> 29:24.678
It's gonna be beautiful, man.

29:25.545 --> 29:26.715
I sure hope so.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.917
It's perfect. We don't
need to clean up no more.

29:30.919 --> 29:33.119
Come on, man.

29:33.121 --> 29:35.023
Man, they can sit on the ground, right?

29:43.564 --> 29:46.432
Hey, yo, Michael.

29:46.434 --> 29:48.967
You don't have to tell us
if you don't want, you know.

29:48.969 --> 29:50.104
I'm cool, but...

29:52.573 --> 29:53.707
What happened, man?

29:54.941 --> 29:57.475
You mean how I got sent to prison?

29:57.477 --> 30:01.446
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you know,
we all know the headline, but,

30:01.448 --> 30:02.750
I wanna hear it from you.

30:04.685 --> 30:06.822
I was hanging with the
wrong crowd one night.

30:10.056 --> 30:13.759
Yo. Michael, Mike. Hey, man, what's up?

30:13.761 --> 30:15.828
What's up, man? You still ballin'?

30:15.830 --> 30:17.428
- Yeah.
- Taking it to the hoop?

30:17.430 --> 30:18.731
Yeah. Somethin' like that.

30:18.733 --> 30:21.532
Hey, man, you wanna make a quick G?

30:21.534 --> 30:23.836
- Doing what?
- Hey, nothing.

30:23.838 --> 30:27.872
I just want to introduce you to
somebody who's a big fan of yours.

30:27.874 --> 30:30.208
- Why the money, though?
- Oh, come on, man.

30:30.210 --> 30:32.611
Look, it's good for business.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.248
You bein' a celebrity and all.

30:39.553 --> 30:41.454
What up, Mr. Johnson?

30:41.456 --> 30:43.155
Hey, Red.

30:43.157 --> 30:46.091
- Do you recognize this guy?
- I sure do.

30:46.093 --> 30:48.561
Michael Diggs! Wow!

30:48.563 --> 30:50.830
- How are you, sir?
- I'm good.

30:50.832 --> 30:52.465
- Big fan of yours.
- Thank you.

30:52.467 --> 30:53.933
What are you doing here?

30:53.935 --> 30:56.234
Twenty eight points a game, right?

30:56.236 --> 30:57.703
More like 27.

30:57.705 --> 30:58.937
What's it matter?

30:58.939 --> 31:01.240
You're one of the best in the nation, kid.

31:01.242 --> 31:03.908
Say, how come the coach
didn't let you shoot

31:03.910 --> 31:05.945
that 3-pointer in the tournament, huh?

31:05.947 --> 31:07.780
I mean, that was stupid, right?

31:07.782 --> 31:09.982
Yeah, I don't know. That's coach.

31:12.019 --> 31:13.686
What? Did you hear that?

31:13.688 --> 31:14.789
Hear what?

31:15.990 --> 31:17.592
I thought I heard something.

31:18.959 --> 31:20.261
No, you ain't hear nothin'.

31:22.030 --> 31:23.862
What are you doing, Red?

31:23.864 --> 31:26.799
Hey, Joe! Get out of here!

31:26.801 --> 31:28.069
Red?

31:30.170 --> 31:31.273
Don't do that, man.

31:37.512 --> 31:39.244
- Why did you shoot him, man?
- Shut up!

31:39.246 --> 31:41.245
- Get out of here! Go home.
- Why did you shoot him?

31:41.247 --> 31:43.616
Man, dead men can't talk, Michael.

31:43.618 --> 31:46.051
Now go home, and you
ain't hear nothin', right?

31:46.053 --> 31:48.055
Nothin'! Nothin'! Now get outta here!

31:52.994 --> 31:54.161
It doesn't look good.

31:56.096 --> 31:58.265
They have you as an accessory to murder.

32:01.601 --> 32:03.035
What does that mean?

32:03.037 --> 32:04.605
Possible life sentence.

32:06.707 --> 32:09.042
I believe you, Michael.

32:09.044 --> 32:12.878
And I will do everything I can to
work out a deal with the prosecutor.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.015
I don't want a deal.

32:14.948 --> 32:16.517
I did nothing wrong.

32:17.649 --> 32:20.586
Michael, you were there.
The killer paid you.

32:20.588 --> 32:23.656
And those are the facts they
are going to present to the jury.

32:23.658 --> 32:24.892
I don't care!

32:26.695 --> 32:28.964
Michael, I know you're innocent.

32:33.333 --> 32:34.635
They used me.

32:37.938 --> 32:39.905
- I was a fool.
- And,

32:39.907 --> 32:42.206
he was identified through a key witness.

32:42.208 --> 32:44.243
When he was later picked up,

32:44.245 --> 32:47.381
he had $1,000 cash on him.

32:48.582 --> 32:50.619
One thousand dollars.

32:51.651 --> 32:53.252
Now, Michael Diggs

32:53.254 --> 32:56.321
will have you believe he was just ignorant.

32:56.323 --> 32:59.226
That he was just... Just
playing the game, huh?

33:01.262 --> 33:04.933
But evidence shows he knew
exactly what he was doing.

33:06.301 --> 33:11.137
Who gives someone $1,000

33:11.139 --> 33:13.605
for just introducing them?

33:13.607 --> 33:17.141
He knew exactly what the
other three defendants,

33:17.143 --> 33:19.213
all gang members, were up to.

33:22.283 --> 33:24.319
And it's for that reason alone...

33:29.957 --> 33:31.126
You must find him guilty.

33:52.912 --> 33:55.313
Talk to me.

33:55.315 --> 33:58.917
- My life is over.
- No, it's not.

33:58.919 --> 34:01.020
- You don't understand.
- We can get through this.

34:01.022 --> 34:02.754
I can't catch no break in court.

34:02.756 --> 34:04.923
- Where's your faith?
- What faith?

34:04.925 --> 34:06.724
There is no God.

34:06.726 --> 34:08.793
God wouldn't do this to me!

34:08.795 --> 34:10.764
- It's over.
- Don't say that.

34:12.867 --> 34:14.400
Go find somebody else!

34:18.005 --> 34:19.737
<i>Your Honor,</i>

34:19.739 --> 34:21.739
my client is innocent.

34:21.742 --> 34:24.376
He has done nothing wrong.

34:24.378 --> 34:28.446
He himself is a victim
of this incredible scam.

34:28.447 --> 34:30.983
- They used his name...
- I don't care.

34:30.985 --> 34:34.085
He should have shown better common sense.

34:34.088 --> 34:37.922
I sentence Mr. Diggs to
10 years in State Penn.

34:37.925 --> 34:41.225
Please escort the defendant
out of my courtroom.

34:41.226 --> 34:43.130
Next case!

34:45.900 --> 34:47.800
I had no idea, man.

34:47.802 --> 34:49.467
And that's not what I heard in the news.

34:49.469 --> 34:52.303
Man, that's not right. That's not right.

34:52.304 --> 34:55.072
I'd be the most bitter man
on the face of the planet

34:55.074 --> 34:57.007
if that happened to me!

34:57.010 --> 34:58.711
But he's not.

34:58.713 --> 35:00.345
That is the whole point.

35:02.015 --> 35:04.783
- How did you keep your sanity, man?
- Faith.

35:04.785 --> 35:06.452
Couldn't you have protested more?

35:06.454 --> 35:08.854
- I mean...
- No.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.289
But you, you would have
been drafted number one!

35:11.291 --> 35:13.158
I mean, in the NBA, bro!

35:13.160 --> 35:15.026
Why you gotta make him feel worse?

35:15.028 --> 35:17.162
It's all right. It's not
like there was a guarantee.

35:17.164 --> 35:19.164
that it would have happened anyway.

35:19.166 --> 35:22.334
I mean, the Good Book says,
"Tomorrow is guarantee to no man.

35:22.336 --> 35:23.903
"And what good does it profit a man

35:23.905 --> 35:26.472
"to gain the world but lose his soul?"

35:26.474 --> 35:27.939
But God has a plan.

35:40.454 --> 35:42.557
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:50.831 --> 35:52.033
How are you?

35:59.039 --> 36:00.241
Why?

36:02.075 --> 36:03.311
You never wrote me.

36:04.544 --> 36:06.347
You never let me visit you.

36:07.347 --> 36:08.416
Why?

36:13.121 --> 36:15.120
Lisa, I didn't want to hurt you.

36:15.122 --> 36:17.189
So you just cut me off?

36:17.191 --> 36:19.492
Did you not think about how I would feel?

36:19.494 --> 36:21.926
Look, I had to do it, all right?

36:21.928 --> 36:23.361
It was something I had to do for myself.

36:23.363 --> 36:24.465
Uh...

36:26.133 --> 36:27.865
I know.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.102
You had to.

36:30.505 --> 36:32.273
The great Michael Diggs.

36:34.508 --> 36:37.542
Always making your own decisions,

36:37.544 --> 36:39.447
regardless how anybody else feels.

36:41.180 --> 36:43.082
I'm a changed man now.

36:43.084 --> 36:44.419
Yeah? How?

36:45.418 --> 36:46.954
I found God.

36:48.322 --> 36:50.388
God?

36:50.390 --> 36:52.293
Well, everybody finds God in prison.

36:56.162 --> 36:58.498
- So you're seeing Craig now?
- Yeah.

36:59.467 --> 37:00.901
We're dating.

37:03.037 --> 37:04.272
He wants to get married.

37:07.842 --> 37:09.043
I'm sure he does.

37:14.881 --> 37:16.950
Listen. I gotta get going.

37:18.852 --> 37:20.488
I'm glad you have a new life now.

37:21.923 --> 37:22.924
Lisa.

37:24.992 --> 37:26.093
Thank you for coming.

37:27.961 --> 37:29.595
I really appreciate it.

37:29.597 --> 37:31.499
Mmm-hmm. Take care.

37:38.405 --> 37:40.641
Michael, come over here.

37:45.445 --> 37:46.646
Yeah, boss?

37:46.648 --> 37:49.381
We're gonna have to let you go.

37:49.383 --> 37:50.919
I'm very sorry, Michael.

37:52.052 --> 37:53.919
Why? I don't understand.

37:53.921 --> 37:56.555
It's the company policy
not to hire convicts.

37:56.557 --> 37:59.524
I didn't know. I didn't read
your application thoroughly.

37:59.526 --> 38:01.158
I was so busy.

38:01.160 --> 38:02.429
Sorry.

38:05.999 --> 38:08.265
It's okay.

38:08.267 --> 38:09.936
You still have a paycheck coming next week.

38:09.938 --> 38:11.405
You can stop by and pick it up.

38:13.407 --> 38:14.474
Yeah.

38:20.113 --> 38:21.148
Thanks.

38:23.416 --> 38:24.651
Take care.

38:40.566 --> 38:42.066
<i>Now you know I've been out there</i>

38:42.068 --> 38:44.001
<i>doin' my thing, shaking the game.</i>

38:44.003 --> 38:46.405
like you need me to,
baby, like you need me to.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.707
And I've spoken to three
lottery teams already,

38:49.709 --> 38:52.945
and they believe if you
declare yourself eligible,

38:52.947 --> 38:56.715
you'll be the number one
player drafted in the draft.

38:56.717 --> 38:59.218
And they're putting their
money where their mouth is.

38:59.220 --> 39:01.287
They're talkin' about 65 milli millies.

39:01.289 --> 39:03.955
We're talkin' about $65 million.

39:03.957 --> 39:06.057
All of your problems go away.

39:06.059 --> 39:08.494
All your worries will leave you this day.

39:08.496 --> 39:10.294
And your beautiful fiancee,

39:10.296 --> 39:12.499
you can give her the life
she deserves, Michael.

39:29.684 --> 39:31.617
<i>Michael, after this
season, many think</i>

39:31.619 --> 39:34.653
you will declare yourself
eligible for the draft.

39:34.655 --> 39:37.222
Any thoughts?

39:37.224 --> 39:39.524
<i>Yeah, I've decided I'm
gonna stay put right here</i>

39:39.526 --> 39:42.126
<i>with my coach and fiancee.
I'm not going anywhere.</i>

39:42.128 --> 39:44.997
Some say you could be
number one in the draft.

39:44.999 --> 39:47.566
- Are you sure?
- What did he say?

39:47.568 --> 39:49.200
He's gonna stay loyal to our school.

39:49.202 --> 39:51.570
You guys, you're unbelievable.

39:51.572 --> 39:53.439
Lisa? Any comments?

39:53.441 --> 39:56.408
Whatever Michael wants that's
best for him, I support.

39:56.410 --> 39:58.175
Michael, can you address the rumor

39:58.177 --> 40:01.046
that Craig Jackson is not
that happy to see you come back

40:01.048 --> 40:03.249
'cause he might have been the
primary scorer this season?

40:03.251 --> 40:05.550
All right, that's all. Folks, thank you.

40:05.552 --> 40:07.086
Thank you very much.

40:07.088 --> 40:09.588
Excuse me. Aren't you his agent?

40:09.590 --> 40:12.323
- What?
- Someone said you're his agent.

40:12.325 --> 40:13.691
Who? I'll sue them.

40:13.693 --> 40:15.660
It's illegal to recruit underclassmen.

40:15.662 --> 40:17.128
I'm a man of integrity.

40:17.130 --> 40:19.030
I represent people like Troy Aikman

40:19.032 --> 40:20.731
and Emmitt Smith and Marshawn Lynch!

40:20.733 --> 40:22.667
Why do I need to do something illegal?

40:22.669 --> 40:24.236
What's your name anyway?

40:24.238 --> 40:26.238
You're goin' around
repeating this, I'll sue you.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.707
I'll sue you till you pay me
with the seams in your jeans.

40:28.709 --> 40:32.146
The only reporting you'll be
doing is from an unemployment line.

40:32.813 --> 40:34.182
Cheap reporters.

40:42.122 --> 40:43.488
- <i>Hi, sir.</i>
- Hi.

40:43.490 --> 40:46.390
Um, I was wondering if
you had any job openings?

40:46.392 --> 40:48.660
I'm sorry, we don't. Uh...

40:48.662 --> 40:52.300
The other shop in the back may have
some openings if you like to try it.

40:53.467 --> 40:55.399
- Okay. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:55.401 --> 40:57.135
- How you doing?
- Hey. How you doing?

40:57.137 --> 40:58.836
What can I do for you?

40:58.838 --> 41:00.439
Um, I was wondering if you
guys had any job openings.

41:00.441 --> 41:02.274
Uh, what kind of experience do you have?

41:02.276 --> 41:05.244
Uh, do you know anything about
carburetors or engine diagnosis?

41:05.246 --> 41:07.245
Um... No, not that.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.749
Can you mount and balance tires?

41:09.749 --> 41:11.182
No, I can't do that, either.

41:11.184 --> 41:12.820
How about oil changes?

41:13.486 --> 41:14.686
No.

41:14.688 --> 41:16.187
Well, unfortunately,

41:16.189 --> 41:17.689
I'm not looking for
anybody right this second,

41:17.691 --> 41:19.356
but I can give you an application.

41:19.358 --> 41:21.158
Um... Once you get some experience,

41:21.160 --> 41:22.327
you can come back and talk to me.

41:22.329 --> 41:24.363
Maybe we can do something for you.

41:24.365 --> 41:26.231
All right. Thank you. I appreciate it, sir.

41:26.233 --> 41:27.568
Sorry about that.

41:33.206 --> 41:34.574
Hey, yo, Mike, what's...

41:36.108 --> 41:37.408
Mike.

41:37.410 --> 41:39.178
Why you lookin' so downcast, man?

41:39.180 --> 41:41.213
- Life ain't that bad.
- What do you want?

41:41.215 --> 41:43.450
Now, is that any way to
talk to your benefactor?

41:45.385 --> 41:46.653
A welcome home gift.

41:47.688 --> 41:49.454
- What is it?
- It's cash.

41:49.456 --> 41:52.390
- Cold cash. $2,500.
- What for?

41:52.392 --> 41:54.760
'Cause I'm givin' it to
you, that's what's for.

41:54.762 --> 41:57.861
No strings attached. Just
consider it a gift to your church.

41:57.863 --> 42:01.468
- How you know about my church?
- I know all things, Mike.

42:02.769 --> 42:04.637
No, thank you.

42:04.639 --> 42:07.738
You know, you really need to
learn how to accept a gift.

42:07.740 --> 42:09.908
No. There's always strings attached.

42:09.910 --> 42:13.281
What's that term? "Beware
of Greeks bearing gifts"?

42:14.180 --> 42:15.412
Nah, I never heard that.

42:15.414 --> 42:16.816
I learned it reading in prison.

42:17.818 --> 42:19.184
You should do the same.

42:19.186 --> 42:21.153
Don't you walk away from me.

42:21.155 --> 42:23.287
So, you think you're better than me,
but you're nothin' but a washed-up

42:23.289 --> 42:24.791
ex-ball player with no future.

42:27.427 --> 42:29.827
See him gettin' all puffed up?

42:29.829 --> 42:31.898
Do somethin' Mike. Do it.

42:34.233 --> 42:37.635
Come on, gimme your best shot, man of God.

42:37.637 --> 42:40.373
See I can see all that anger inside of you.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.608
But God can't help you, can He?

42:43.610 --> 42:47.347
No. God can't save you
'cause He doesn't exist.

42:48.514 --> 42:49.650
But I do.

42:50.883 --> 42:52.452
So don't you forget that.

43:00.260 --> 43:01.395
Just chill out.

43:15.610 --> 43:17.812
Arthur, that last order is for table 5.

43:28.655 --> 43:30.488
Michael Diggs.

43:30.490 --> 43:32.423
Long time no see.

43:32.425 --> 43:35.359
- Hi, Mr. Peters.
- When did you...

43:35.361 --> 43:37.030
Last week.

43:39.566 --> 43:42.367
So glad you're back.

43:42.369 --> 43:44.369
I know a lot of people have
been hating on you, Michael,

43:44.371 --> 43:45.872
but I believed in you.

43:46.606 --> 43:48.640
Thank you.

43:48.642 --> 43:51.276
Now. What can I do for you?

43:51.278 --> 43:54.479
I was wondering if you
had any job openings.

43:54.481 --> 43:57.450
I'm sorry, Michael. I
just filled an opening.

43:59.852 --> 44:02.023
Mr. Peters, I really need this job.

44:03.823 --> 44:06.390
I'll do anythin' for work.

44:06.392 --> 44:08.762
- Have you tried next door?
- Yes.

44:11.465 --> 44:16.867
Well, would you be willing
to bus tables and wash dishes?

44:16.869 --> 44:18.805
Yes. I'd do anything.

44:22.309 --> 44:24.843
Hey. Be sure to get all
the grease out, okay?

44:24.845 --> 44:26.514
Them fried chicken has a lot of oil in it.

44:27.546 --> 44:28.548
Yes, sir.

44:37.691 --> 44:39.591
- Hungry, man!
- Hey, me, too.

44:39.593 --> 44:42.327
And everything's on me today, baby.

44:42.329 --> 44:45.729
It better be. You makin'
2.5 mill a year off me.

44:45.731 --> 44:47.332
That's a fact, CJ,

44:47.334 --> 44:49.001
but the truth is,

44:49.003 --> 44:51.303
I get so much 'cause I
make you so much more, baby.

44:51.305 --> 44:52.540
I get you the best deals.

44:56.043 --> 44:57.575
What was that?

44:57.577 --> 44:59.678
It's okay, folks. Just some broken plates.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.745
Hey, Michael, go get a broom.

45:01.747 --> 45:03.448
Yes, sir.

45:03.450 --> 45:05.383
What have you decided on?

45:05.385 --> 45:06.787
Michael Diggs!

45:07.720 --> 45:09.023
Come here!

45:12.559 --> 45:14.057
Look at this fool.

45:14.059 --> 45:15.563
What's up, guys?

45:16.595 --> 45:18.430
You a cook now?

45:18.432 --> 45:20.030
I didn't know you could cook.

45:20.032 --> 45:21.633
No.

45:21.635 --> 45:23.604
So what are you doing in the kitchen?

45:25.506 --> 45:27.671
I was washing the dishes.

45:27.673 --> 45:29.807
Washing the dishes?

45:29.809 --> 45:32.676
When you're busing those suds, make
sure you clean the dishes, baby.

45:32.678 --> 45:35.446
I hate a dirty, greasy dish,
you know what I'm sayin'?

45:35.448 --> 45:37.816
Go hard on him. That's crazy.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.550
Michael,

45:39.552 --> 45:42.820
my mom's having a
birthday party on Saturday.

45:42.822 --> 45:46.591
- Would you like to come?
- No, I'm sorry. I can't.

45:46.593 --> 45:47.728
I gotta work.

45:48.595 --> 45:50.062
Okay.

45:50.064 --> 45:51.465
Are you okay?

45:53.032 --> 45:54.865
Do you need any help from us?

45:54.867 --> 45:57.068
Check it out.

45:57.070 --> 45:58.702
I'ma keep it real with you.

45:58.704 --> 45:59.773
If you need it...

46:01.407 --> 46:02.610
I definitely got it.

46:04.144 --> 46:06.080
We go back. Just holla at me.

46:09.715 --> 46:11.381
No, I'm good.

46:11.383 --> 46:13.684
If anything, you could
just give it to my church.

46:13.686 --> 46:16.088
Your church? What do I look like?

46:16.090 --> 46:19.457
- Yo, what church is this?
- The one on 112th Street.

46:19.459 --> 46:22.093
That building's been closed forever, baby.

46:22.095 --> 46:24.129
Yeah. We reopened it.

46:24.131 --> 46:26.164
You guys should drop by sometime.

46:26.166 --> 46:27.765
We'll see.

46:27.767 --> 46:29.066
Listen, I gotta get back to work, though.

46:29.068 --> 46:31.635
It was good seeing you all. Take care.

46:31.637 --> 46:33.504
- Good seeing you too.
- Bye, Michael.

46:33.506 --> 46:34.805
That's quite a fall.

46:34.807 --> 46:36.075
What a waste.

46:37.744 --> 46:39.111
God!

46:39.113 --> 46:41.113
Everybody finds God in prison.

46:41.115 --> 46:43.948
Yeah. I said that, too.

46:43.950 --> 46:45.584
Do you believe in God?

46:45.586 --> 46:47.455
- Who? Me?
- Yeah.

46:49.756 --> 46:53.057
That's my God right there.
And I praise him every day.

46:55.496 --> 46:57.097
<i>Look, I know a lot of
y'all had it rough.</i>

46:58.865 --> 47:00.468
But you gotta keep your faith.

47:02.702 --> 47:05.503
It's been really tough for me too,

47:05.505 --> 47:09.508
but I truly believe,
like the Good Book says,

47:09.510 --> 47:12.176
all things work together for the good.

47:12.178 --> 47:15.648
Yeah, sometimes it doesn't seem like
things work together for the good.

47:16.115 --> 47:17.749
At all.

47:17.751 --> 47:22.019
Sometimes it may seem
like there's no way out,

47:22.021 --> 47:24.521
like you've hit rock bottom.

47:24.523 --> 47:27.624
I bet Joseph felt that way when
he was in that prison in Egypt

47:27.626 --> 47:29.995
for a crime he didn't even commit.

47:29.997 --> 47:33.097
And after many years,
God got him outta there,

47:33.099 --> 47:35.133
and look how that worked out.

47:35.135 --> 47:38.070
Thank you, Michael, for sharing that.

47:38.072 --> 47:42.506
We all appreciate your transparency
in sharing all your trials with us.

47:42.508 --> 47:44.945
Let's stand up and pray now.

47:47.981 --> 47:49.049
Hi.

47:50.182 --> 47:51.217
Hi.

47:52.552 --> 47:53.687
So glad you made it.

47:55.655 --> 47:56.789
Well...

48:00.760 --> 48:02.195
I wanted to show my support.

48:04.965 --> 48:07.198
Wow!

48:07.200 --> 48:09.837
- This is a lot.
- That's okay.

48:14.675 --> 48:16.644
So do you want to get lunch or something?

48:17.309 --> 48:20.211
Uh... No. I'm sorry.

48:20.213 --> 48:21.778
Craig is coming to pick me up.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.883
We're going to a celebrity basketball game.

48:24.617 --> 48:25.619
Okay.

48:26.519 --> 48:28.686
No worries.

48:28.688 --> 48:29.990
Take care of yourself.

48:31.258 --> 48:32.560
Will do.

48:35.160 --> 48:36.162
Hey, Lisa.

48:37.798 --> 48:39.066
Thanks again for coming.

48:40.233 --> 48:41.702
Really appreciate it.

48:47.139 --> 48:49.807
I'm sorry. He's not seeing anyone.

48:49.809 --> 48:52.276
I know. But I'm his fiancee.

48:52.278 --> 48:55.349
Yes, but, um, he's not seeing anyone.

48:58.318 --> 49:00.617
Why? How is this possible?

49:00.619 --> 49:03.086
- What...
- It's his choice.

49:03.088 --> 49:05.222
Well, can you tell him I'm here?

49:05.224 --> 49:07.191
I did.

49:07.193 --> 49:08.861
And he doesn't want to see you.

49:12.032 --> 49:13.133
I'm sorry.

49:20.773 --> 49:22.573
She's gone.

49:22.575 --> 49:24.311
You can complete your journey alone now.

49:29.582 --> 49:30.818
Hmm.

49:35.856 --> 49:38.856
Split. Split. Split. I
got it. I got the ball.

49:42.961 --> 49:44.729
He's back, baby!

49:49.068 --> 49:51.769
- Game, baby! That's right.
- Ooh!

49:51.771 --> 49:54.338
Come on now. Let's go.

49:54.340 --> 49:56.240
Where'd you learn to dunk like that?

49:56.242 --> 49:57.843
I don't know.

49:57.845 --> 49:59.910
You got some serious
hops for your age, bro.

49:59.912 --> 50:02.046
Thanks, man.

50:02.048 --> 50:04.048
Man, those six years behind
bars did nothing to change that.

50:04.050 --> 50:06.917
There's a dunk competition,
Michael. You should join.

50:06.919 --> 50:09.019
They allow convicts, I think.

50:09.021 --> 50:10.687
Man, you got some serious game.

50:10.689 --> 50:12.222
Thanks, bro. Thanks, man.

50:12.224 --> 50:13.925
- And you can fly, too.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:13.927 --> 50:15.894
I want you to enter my
dunk contest this weekend.

50:15.896 --> 50:18.896
Yeah, right. It's the Kenny
Dobbs dunk competition.

50:18.898 --> 50:20.733
Hey. What is this tiny guy doing?

50:23.369 --> 50:25.236
What you think, man?

50:25.238 --> 50:29.173
I think when his mom met his dad
and they made him 4 feet nothin',

50:29.175 --> 50:32.843
it's okay for him to stop
foolin' himself about dunkin'.

50:32.845 --> 50:34.211
Hey. I'll dunk it one day.

50:34.213 --> 50:35.847
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

50:35.849 --> 50:37.749
When a snowball freezes in hell.

50:37.751 --> 50:39.383
You're too short to dunk.

50:39.385 --> 50:41.986
Man, what are you talking about?

50:41.988 --> 50:44.756
Snowballs don't freeze in hell.

50:44.758 --> 50:48.026
All I'm sayin', man, is there are
some things that are impossible.

50:48.028 --> 50:49.827
Man, I would love to encourage you.

50:49.829 --> 50:51.963
There's just not enough
of you to encourage.

50:51.965 --> 50:53.267
You're too short to dunk.

50:54.267 --> 50:56.033
I will, man.

50:56.035 --> 50:59.003
Man, why don't you leave the
brother alone and get a life?

50:59.005 --> 51:01.006
I have a life. What about you?

51:01.008 --> 51:02.707
I have a life.

51:02.709 --> 51:04.809
Oh, really? Where do you work?

51:04.811 --> 51:07.010
- Me? Taco Hut.
- Mmm-hmm.

51:07.012 --> 51:08.178
Taco Hut?

51:08.180 --> 51:09.814
Never heard of it.

51:09.816 --> 51:12.383
What is that, like the poor,
poor cousin to Taco Bell?

51:12.385 --> 51:14.051
Yeah. So what?

51:14.053 --> 51:18.722
But it shows. No direction, no focus.

51:18.724 --> 51:21.227
That right there? That
should cover your expenses.

51:24.363 --> 51:25.896
Tsk!

51:25.898 --> 51:28.298
- Man, what's his problem?
- Hey!

51:28.300 --> 51:30.934
Hey! You think it's impossible?

51:30.936 --> 51:32.336
You got you something. All right.

51:32.338 --> 51:34.704
Let's go!

51:34.706 --> 51:35.842
Hey!

51:37.244 --> 51:39.042
Let's go, Douggy!

51:39.044 --> 51:40.945
Let's go! Go get it.

51:40.947 --> 51:43.213
Get it. Go get it. There you go.

51:43.215 --> 51:44.782
Go get it!

51:47.720 --> 51:49.255
Yeah! Yeah!

51:56.829 --> 51:59.731
Hey! And I'm 5'5.

51:59.733 --> 52:01.231
- That was crazy.
- There you go.

52:01.233 --> 52:03.401
- Yeah!
- There you go.

52:03.403 --> 52:04.538
Hey!

52:13.947 --> 52:14.981
Hey, Ma.

52:21.755 --> 52:22.890
How are you?

52:27.059 --> 52:30.229
- Mom, you all right?
- I'm fine.

52:33.332 --> 52:37.068
Mom, you sure I can't get you
something from the drugstore?

52:37.070 --> 52:41.238
No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.

52:41.240 --> 52:43.541
I'm gonna join that dunk
competition on Saturday.

52:45.043 --> 52:46.876
What you think?

52:46.878 --> 52:49.982
I think you'll win it if you
want to, Michael. That's for sure.

52:52.151 --> 52:56.820
Mom, Mom, look, Mom, you sure
I can't get you something?

52:56.822 --> 53:00.224
The nearest drugstore is seven miles away.

53:00.226 --> 53:02.794
I mean, I can go on a bus.

53:02.796 --> 53:04.095
You know that.

53:04.097 --> 53:06.396
I'm fine. I'm fine.

53:16.943 --> 53:20.345
- How's your new job?
- Oh, it's great.

53:20.347 --> 53:23.082
I'm learning how to be the
world's fastest dishwasher.

53:29.555 --> 53:31.988
Have you seen Taye?

53:31.990 --> 53:33.860
No, I haven't.

53:35.260 --> 53:36.630
I was looking for him too.

53:39.465 --> 53:40.499
Michael,

53:42.102 --> 53:43.871
if anything should happen to me,

53:44.438 --> 53:46.437
and it shouldn't,

53:46.439 --> 53:49.106
but, if anything should happen to me,

53:49.108 --> 53:50.941
please take care of your brother.

53:50.943 --> 53:52.144
Mom,

53:53.313 --> 53:55.345
listen.

53:55.347 --> 53:57.116
Always gonna take care of Taye.

53:58.351 --> 54:00.218
But don't worry.

54:00.220 --> 54:01.619
I mean, nothing's gonna happen to you.

54:01.621 --> 54:04.856
I know, dear.

54:04.858 --> 54:07.024
I just want to be reassured.

54:11.997 --> 54:13.467
Mom, don't worry at all, okay?

54:16.535 --> 54:19.403

55:09.255 --> 55:10.691
Let's just have a good contest.

55:12.592 --> 55:14.524

- I'm Bill Smith.

55:34.014 --> 55:36.213
<i>And this is Jerry
Johnson with Channel 19.</i>

55:36.215 --> 55:37.715
<i>The first dunker of the night,</i>

55:37.717 --> 55:41.285
<i>we got my boy Steve
Trace from Los Angeles.</i>

55:41.287 --> 55:44.722
<i>Clap your hands. Let's
go. Clap! Clap! Clap!</i>

55:44.724 --> 55:48.024
<i>Clap! Clap! Clap!</i>

55:48.026 --> 55:51.062
<i>Off the glass! Tomahawk dunk!</i>

55:51.064 --> 55:53.997
<i>Whoa! Beautiful! Beautiful!</i>

55:53.999 --> 55:57.267
<i>Off the glass with a Tomahawk slam.</i>

55:57.269 --> 55:59.037
- Boo!
- That was a horrible dunk.

55:59.039 --> 56:00.604
He didn't even get off the ground!

56:00.606 --> 56:02.273
<i>Here we go, first round.</i>

56:02.275 --> 56:04.274
<i>It's the Great White Hype.</i>

56:04.276 --> 56:05.746
<i>Let's go!</i>

56:07.747 --> 56:10.280
<i>He takes off, one...</i>

56:12.452 --> 56:14.584
A 35 from the judges.

56:14.586 --> 56:15.753
- Not too shabby.
- Well deserved.

56:15.755 --> 56:17.320
<i>We got the Big Fella.</i>

56:17.322 --> 56:19.590
<i>Seven and some change.
Rock the cradle.</i>

56:19.592 --> 56:23.394
<i>Rock the cradle! Put
the baby to sleep!</i>

56:23.396 --> 56:26.396
<i>Put the baby to sleep!</i>

56:26.398 --> 56:29.033
10! 10! 10!

56:29.035 --> 56:30.570
Man, that's the worst dunk I've ever seen!

56:32.671 --> 56:35.205
<i>Whoa! With a Tomahawk slam!</i>

56:35.207 --> 56:36.774
Ooh, tomahawk, dog.

56:36.776 --> 56:40.176
In the vein of Vince Carter. I love it.

56:40.178 --> 56:42.680
<i>Here he goes. Windmill!</i>

56:42.682 --> 56:44.481
Oh, yes.

56:44.483 --> 56:46.617
<i>Very, very finesse
touch on that one.</i>

56:46.619 --> 56:49.653
<i>We got the shortest man in
our competition. He's 5'9.</i>

56:49.655 --> 56:51.757
<i>Now show him some love. Let's go!</i>

56:54.026 --> 56:56.794
<i>Windmill dunk reverse!</i>

56:56.796 --> 56:59.196
A reverse dunk, ladies and gentlemen.

56:59.198 --> 57:00.633
<i>Make some noise!</i>

57:02.235 --> 57:03.767
<i>All right, here we go. Round one.</i>

57:03.769 --> 57:06.370
<i>He's setting up his dunk.
What is he gonna do?</i>

57:06.372 --> 57:08.305
<i>Looks like he's
bringing in some help.</i>

57:08.307 --> 57:10.073
<i>He's gonna go off for the bounce.</i>

57:10.075 --> 57:12.042
<i>Let's go, crowd, make some noise!</i>

57:14.447 --> 57:18.682
<i>Off the bounce. Windmill dunk!</i>

57:18.684 --> 57:22.653
<i>Off the bounce with the first
round, we got Michael Diggs.</i>

57:22.655 --> 57:24.821
<i>Make some noise!</i>

57:24.823 --> 57:27.158
<i>But Michael Diggs has been
out of it for so long,</i>

57:27.160 --> 57:29.260
<i>but I don't think that matters.</i>

57:29.262 --> 57:31.762
<i>I agree, but we're gonna have to
wait and see how this all plays out.</i>

57:31.764 --> 57:34.399
<i>He just got outta
prison after six years.</i>

57:34.401 --> 57:36.401
<i>Now make some noise!</i>

57:36.403 --> 57:38.102
Mike, come on! Mike, come on!

57:38.104 --> 57:41.338
Mike! Mike! Mike!

57:41.340 --> 57:44.841
<i>Just the local magic
of Michael Diggs!</i>

57:44.843 --> 57:46.479
<i>Oh!</i>

57:49.081 --> 57:50.146
<i>Ooh!</i>

57:51.584 --> 57:53.350
<i>That was crazy right there.</i>

57:53.352 --> 57:55.119
That was the sickest dunk I've ever seen.

57:55.121 --> 57:57.655
What, are you superhuman
or something? Hoo-hoo!

57:57.657 --> 58:00.256
<i>Ten! Ten! Ten!</i>

58:00.258 --> 58:02.825
<i>And another ten! All
across the board!</i>

58:02.827 --> 58:05.264
Incredible. The judges gave him a 40.

58:09.769 --> 58:12.772
<i>We got The Jammer. Let's
go. Make some noise!</i>

58:17.242 --> 58:19.709
<i>Off the lob</i>

58:19.711 --> 58:22.479
<i>with the reverse slam!</i>

58:25.584 --> 58:28.452
I think Jammer has the ultimate tools

58:28.454 --> 58:30.754
to make it to the championship round.

58:30.756 --> 58:32.557
<i>In the first round
he went off the glass</i>

58:32.559 --> 58:34.658
<i>with the Tomahawk.
Let's see what he's got.</i>

58:34.660 --> 58:37.264
<i>Let's go, crowd, make some noise!</i>

58:39.731 --> 58:41.899
<i>Let's go crowd, clap
it up. Clap it up.</i>

58:41.901 --> 58:45.135
<i>360! Oh, with the 360 dunk!</i>

58:45.137 --> 58:46.436
Whoa!

58:46.438 --> 58:47.905
Beautiful! Beautiful!

58:47.907 --> 58:50.207
<i>Round two, it's the
Great White Hype.</i>

58:50.209 --> 58:51.642
<i>What's he gonna do?</i>

58:53.680 --> 58:57.881
<i>The Great White Hype from the
baseline. Reverse two hands!</i>

58:59.584 --> 59:02.352
<i>Five, six, seven, seven.</i>

59:02.354 --> 59:05.891
<i>We got the Big Fella. 360!</i>

59:07.559 --> 59:10.229
- <i>360!</i>
- Oh, please, that's nothin'.

59:11.932 --> 59:13.631
<i>With a pop reverse.</i>

59:13.633 --> 59:14.798
Oh...

59:14.800 --> 59:16.233
My goodness!

59:16.235 --> 59:18.503
<i>A three, a one, a two,</i>

59:18.505 --> 59:20.504
<i>and another one. No love.</i>

59:20.506 --> 59:23.240
<i>In the first round, he
slapped the glass in windmill,</i>

59:23.242 --> 59:25.778
<i>now with a reverse off one foot!</i>

59:28.715 --> 59:30.414
<i>Whoo!</i>

59:30.416 --> 59:32.950
<i>This competition is heating up!</i>

59:32.952 --> 59:37.720
<i>Nine, nine, ten, ten.
There we go, much respect.</i>

59:37.722 --> 59:40.457
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Make some noise!

59:40.459 --> 59:43.894
<i>Out of the hand. Windmill dunk!</i>

59:45.865 --> 59:47.497
<i>All right, here we go!</i>

59:47.499 --> 59:52.470
<i>Make some noise for Michael Diggs!</i>

59:52.472 --> 59:55.740
Let's go, kids! Make some
noise! Make some noise!

59:55.742 --> 59:59.744
Michael! Michael! Michael!

59:59.746 --> 01:00:03.414
Michael! Michael! Michael!

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:05.952
- Michael! Michael! Michael!
- There we go.

01:00:06.852 --> 01:00:08.388
Oh!

01:00:11.523 --> 01:00:15.392
<i>Tens across the board! 360 windmill!</i>

01:00:15.394 --> 01:00:18.528
- Michael!
- Oh, yeah!

01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:20.266
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:00:22.602 --> 01:00:24.801
<i>Last round, he had the 360 dunk.</i>

01:00:24.803 --> 01:00:26.769
<i>What is he gonna do? Off the wall!</i>

01:00:26.771 --> 01:00:28.604
Aw!

01:00:28.606 --> 01:00:31.008
<i>Here we go. Seven foot
tall and some change.</i>

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:33.477
<i>Make some noise!</i>

01:00:33.479 --> 01:00:36.280
- Let's go!
- Out of the hand!

01:00:36.282 --> 01:00:37.847
<i>All right. That's it. That's it.</i>

01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:39.682
<i>He's out, man. So close.</i>

01:00:39.684 --> 01:00:43.287
<i>This is it. The third
and final round.</i>

01:00:43.289 --> 01:00:46.823
<i>Michael Diggs!</i>

01:00:46.825 --> 01:00:48.427
<i>Oh!</i>

01:00:49.762 --> 01:00:53.463
<i>With the Tomahawk Sling shot!</i>

01:00:53.465 --> 01:00:56.434
Now that is gonna be hard
for The Jammer to beat.

01:00:56.436 --> 01:00:58.702
I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.

01:00:58.704 --> 01:01:00.271
Michael!

01:01:00.273 --> 01:01:02.740
<i>All right, this is
it, our last dunk.</i>

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.508
<i>He needs a perfect score to win.</i>

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:08.048
<i>Make some noise for
your champ The Jammer!</i>

01:01:17.923 --> 01:01:20.957
The moment of his career is happening now.

01:01:20.959 --> 01:01:23.359
<i>Wiping off his shoes,
he's ready to go.</i>

01:01:23.361 --> 01:01:26.398
<i>Let's go, crowd, make some noise!</i>

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.635
<i>Jammer! Jammer! Jammer!</i>

01:01:31.637 --> 01:01:34.738
<i>Jammer! Jammer! Jammer!</i>

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:37.608
<i>He's up in the air! Oh!</i>

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:38.975
Oh, my goodness!

01:01:38.977 --> 01:01:40.546
<i>Oh!</i>

01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:44.648
<i>Ten, ten, ten!</i>

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:47.651
<i>And a perfect score. He
wins the competition!</i>

01:01:47.653 --> 01:01:50.387
- No way. A 40!
- All tens!

01:01:50.389 --> 01:01:51.955
- A perfect 40!
- Wow!

01:01:51.957 --> 01:01:55.024
That's what I'm talkin'
about winning it all.

01:01:55.026 --> 01:01:56.794
Better go back to school, Michael.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.428
Or better yet, jail.

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.064
Oh, yo, that's not right, man.

01:02:00.066 --> 01:02:01.801
So what're you gonna do about it?

01:02:03.736 --> 01:02:05.436
- That's what I thought, punk.
- Jammer! Jammer! Jammer!

01:02:05.438 --> 01:02:06.704
Hey.

01:02:06.706 --> 01:02:07.970
And your winner

01:02:07.972 --> 01:02:09.941
of the Kenny Dobbs Dunk Competition is

01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:11.908
The Jammer!

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:13.109
Jammer! Jammer!

01:02:13.111 --> 01:02:15.479
Great effort, Michael.

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:19.483
Are you going to the national
championship next month in Venice Beach?

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:22.686
- Uh, no. I don't think so.
- But you automatically qualify.

01:02:22.688 --> 01:02:24.888
Oh, you goin'. You goin'.
He's goin'. How you doin'?

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.789
Jerome Matthews, I'm his
agent. Nice to meet you.

01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:28.457
- Michael.
- Pleasure to meet you.

01:02:28.459 --> 01:02:30.126
- Michael, it's your mom.
- What?

01:02:30.128 --> 01:02:32.495
- She collapsed. I called 911.
- What happened?

01:02:32.497 --> 01:02:33.900
I don't know!

01:02:35.901 --> 01:02:39.438
Mom! Mom, you okay? Mom!

01:02:40.639 --> 01:02:43.140
Call help! Call help!

01:02:43.142 --> 01:02:45.879
Mom! Mom! Mom.

01:02:47.512 --> 01:02:48.847
Mom.

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:03.861
- Is she gonna be okay?
- She had a stroke.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:05.465
I'm so sorry.

01:03:07.666 --> 01:03:09.566
She was so happy today.

01:03:09.568 --> 01:03:11.470
Seeing me play, it was like old times.

01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:16.075
- And then...
- I know.

01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:19.178
Michael, but she was happy.

01:03:21.079 --> 01:03:22.648
Listen, you better go.

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:25.749
It's late.

01:03:25.751 --> 01:03:27.687
- Michael, I...
- I understand.

01:03:30.456 --> 01:03:31.691
I appreciate you coming.

01:03:49.108 --> 01:03:53.880
<i>Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.</i>

01:04:28.947 --> 01:04:31.580
- Yo. Where you been?
- How is she?

01:04:31.582 --> 01:04:32.851
She had a stroke!

01:04:33.985 --> 01:04:35.686
Is she gonna be okay?

01:04:35.688 --> 01:04:37.521
- Where have you been?
- Around.

01:04:37.523 --> 01:04:39.923
Around? That doesn't
cut anymore, little bro!

01:04:39.925 --> 01:04:42.158
- Look, you ain't my daddy.
- No, I ain't your daddy.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.760
But I'm your big brother.

01:04:43.762 --> 01:04:45.629
I'm not lettin' you fall like I did.

01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:47.064
Look, what do you want from me, huh?

01:04:47.066 --> 01:04:48.999
I want you to get your life together!

01:04:49.001 --> 01:04:52.071
If not for yourself, then
do it for Mom! That's what.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.975
- Go to hell.
- Hell?

01:04:56.775 --> 01:04:58.642
I've been there.

01:04:58.644 --> 01:05:00.313
Try six years in prison, Taye.

01:05:02.514 --> 01:05:04.049
You done? Hmm?

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:40.550
She loves you, man.

01:05:40.552 --> 01:05:42.854
She told me to take care of
you if anything happens to her.

01:05:53.733 --> 01:05:57.166
Doc, I don't want her moved.

01:05:57.168 --> 01:06:00.637
Michael, her insurance
doesn't cover private rooms.

01:06:00.639 --> 01:06:01.740
I'm so sorry.

01:06:02.707 --> 01:06:04.140
How much does it cost?

01:06:04.142 --> 01:06:06.612
Approximately $26,000 a month.

01:06:07.747 --> 01:06:10.314
Oh, this is our V.P., Kent Ashworth.

01:06:10.316 --> 01:06:12.115
Michael, I'm sorry.

01:06:12.117 --> 01:06:14.621
Your insurance just doesn't
cover a private room.

01:06:22.794 --> 01:06:24.796
I'll give you the other thousand later.

01:06:25.363 --> 01:06:27.196
What is this?

01:06:27.198 --> 01:06:28.401
I won it yesterday.

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:37.810
God...

01:06:40.044 --> 01:06:42.414
I just want my mother
to have another chance.

01:06:45.383 --> 01:06:47.684
I let her down so many times.

01:06:51.055 --> 01:06:52.425
She don't deserve me.

01:06:54.927 --> 01:06:56.162
She don't deserve me.

01:06:58.898 --> 01:07:03.102
I just want my mother back,
God, please! Please, God.

01:07:13.378 --> 01:07:14.945
What's up with you, boss?

01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:17.079
Man. Good to see you. Always a pleasure.

01:07:17.081 --> 01:07:19.716
For sure. For sure.

01:07:19.718 --> 01:07:22.419
- What's wrong with you?
- It's Michael's mom.

01:07:22.421 --> 01:07:24.354
She suffered from a stroke.

01:07:24.356 --> 01:07:25.858
For real?

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:29.194
Damn.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.898
That's crazy.

01:07:33.064 --> 01:07:34.363
What up, boy?

01:07:34.365 --> 01:07:36.200
I'm gonna see you inside.

01:07:36.202 --> 01:07:37.370
Come on, baby.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:42.439
There he is. There's my man.

01:07:42.441 --> 01:07:45.408
- How you doin'?
- I'm good. Good to see you.

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:47.042
Come on, I'll get you guys in.

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:51.715
All right, Craig Jackson is in the house!

01:07:51.717 --> 01:07:53.149
You dig it? Yeah!

01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:56.253
What up? What's up? What up?

01:07:56.255 --> 01:07:58.055
What up, what up, what up, what up?

01:07:58.057 --> 01:07:59.689
- What's up, boy?
- Hello, boy.

01:07:59.691 --> 01:08:01.390
- How you been, man?
- Good, son.

01:08:01.392 --> 01:08:03.292
How y'all doin'? Check it out,
man. Shout out to everybody in here.

01:08:03.294 --> 01:08:05.294
Shout out to my boys Tray,
Money, and Harlem over there.

01:08:05.296 --> 01:08:07.064
Garyonie and Wheezie. I see y'all.

01:08:07.066 --> 01:08:09.066
Good to see you, bro. How you doing?

01:08:09.068 --> 01:08:10.834
I'm good. Anything you need. Anything.

01:08:10.836 --> 01:08:12.401
I appreciate it, man.
It's good to be here, man.

01:08:12.403 --> 01:08:14.137
I like what you've done with the place.

01:08:14.139 --> 01:08:16.238
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You lit it up tonight, man.

01:08:16.241 --> 01:08:18.041
I appreciate you, fam. Thank you, man.

01:08:18.042 --> 01:08:20.176
- Forty five points.
- Don't forget about the 12 assists.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.377
You know how that go. Already. Yeah.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.046
Let me get another 40, homie.

01:08:24.049 --> 01:08:25.346
I need one. Right now.

01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:26.917
I think you've had enough.

01:08:26.919 --> 01:08:29.086
Girl, what's wrong with you?

01:08:29.087 --> 01:08:31.758
Don't be snatchin' nothin'
away from me in this club.

01:08:32.523 --> 01:08:34.026
Better watch yourself.

01:08:36.094 --> 01:08:38.461
Out here acting crazy.

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:40.796
- What's wrong with you? Look at me.
- Don't touch me like that.

01:08:40.799 --> 01:08:43.800
Don't you hear me talkin' to you?
Look at me when I'm talkin' to you.

01:08:43.801 --> 01:08:45.135
What's wrong with you?

01:08:45.136 --> 01:08:46.339
I just had a bad day!

01:08:47.071 --> 01:08:48.273
Bad day?

01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:51.975
You seem to be havin' a lot more bad days

01:08:51.978 --> 01:08:54.080
now that Michael and his mom is around.

01:08:57.249 --> 01:08:59.948
Why do you care about
him and his mom so much?

01:08:59.951 --> 01:09:02.385
- It's irritating me!
- Because she's a good woman.

01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:04.488
A good woman? How is she a good woman?

01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:07.756
What does she do for
you, me, or anybody else?

01:09:07.759 --> 01:09:09.529
Look at me when I'm talkin' to you.

01:09:11.028 --> 01:09:13.495
I just went to support him as a friend.

01:09:13.497 --> 01:09:17.234
He won the slam dunk
competition, by the way.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:21.171
A friend? Are you talkin' to me
about a slam dunk competition?

01:09:21.173 --> 01:09:24.073
See, that's what trip me out
about these girls nowadays.

01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:28.243
$25,000 got you hot and bothered,
ready to throw it around.

01:09:28.245 --> 01:09:31.481
There's 25 mill over here,
baby. Don't play yourself.

01:09:31.483 --> 01:09:33.917
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:35.287
Out of here.

01:09:39.124 --> 01:09:40.225
Bitch, I...

01:09:43.795 --> 01:09:47.095
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:48.997
- Girl, I know you hear me talkin' to you?
- What?

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.801
Come here!

01:09:50.803 --> 01:09:53.337
Man, are you trippin'
over this fool making 7.50?

01:09:53.339 --> 01:09:54.538
- No.
- Seven-fifty.

01:09:54.540 --> 01:09:55.838
That's what you want?

01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.274
He makes 10!

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:58.908
Oh, well, don't break the bank, homie.

01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:00.976
But he has a million dollar heart.

01:10:00.978 --> 01:10:02.578
You're right. He'll never be you.

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.948
Yeah, I'm glad you know that.

01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:07.517
There's only one Craig Jackson out
here. And that's me. The big homie.

01:10:07.519 --> 01:10:10.252
The best thing that ever
happened to you! And you know it.

01:10:10.254 --> 01:10:11.855
Twenty-five mil.

01:10:11.857 --> 01:10:13.323
You just walked away from it.

01:10:13.325 --> 01:10:16.226
I'm available if you're looking.

01:10:16.228 --> 01:10:18.127
Hoochie, get out of my face.

01:10:18.129 --> 01:10:20.330
I don't have time to be playin' with y'all.

01:10:20.332 --> 01:10:23.867
Hoochie? You best not come here
and say that to my face again!

01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:26.270
- Yeah, you.
- Oh, yeah? What if I do?

01:10:26.272 --> 01:10:28.238
You a hoochie and nothin' else!

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.273
- Uh!
- Uh, what?

01:10:30.275 --> 01:10:32.309
- She hit me.
- Yeah, I hit you.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.209
- No, no.
- I didn't think so.

01:10:34.211 --> 01:10:35.447
Get off me, man!

01:10:37.014 --> 01:10:38.150
Don't touch me!

01:10:40.052 --> 01:10:42.121
Nobody touch me! Nobody!

01:10:51.495 --> 01:10:52.898
Mama?

01:10:57.436 --> 01:10:59.435
I love you, Michael dear.

01:10:59.437 --> 01:11:02.006
Mama, please, please don't. Please don't.

01:11:02.008 --> 01:11:07.177
The way you came back made me so happy.

01:11:07.179 --> 01:11:10.349
Made my entire life worth it.

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:13.052
Please don't.

01:11:14.452 --> 01:11:16.019
Please don't.

01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:17.555
You'll be fine.

01:11:19.291 --> 01:11:22.525
- Please don't...
- You'll be fine.

01:11:22.527 --> 01:11:25.895
No, Ma, please don't. Please.

01:11:25.897 --> 01:11:28.030
Watch over Taye for me.

01:11:28.032 --> 01:11:29.401
He needs you.

01:11:32.103 --> 01:11:35.939
I promise I will. I promise I will.

01:11:35.941 --> 01:11:38.408
I'm going home.

01:11:38.410 --> 01:11:40.546
No, Mama. No, Mama. Please.

01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.217
- I'll see you again.
- No.

01:11:45.983 --> 01:11:47.652
No, please.

01:11:49.019 --> 01:11:52.088
No. No! Please.

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.489
Please, Mama!

01:12:28.727 --> 01:12:31.093
"The Lord is my shepherd.

01:12:31.095 --> 01:12:35.399
"I lack nothing. He makes me
lie down in green pastures.

01:12:35.401 --> 01:12:38.333
"He leads me beside quiet waters.

01:12:38.335 --> 01:12:40.636
"He refreshes my soul.

01:12:40.638 --> 01:12:43.605
"Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,

01:12:43.607 --> 01:12:47.377
"I will fear no evil, for You are with me.

01:12:47.379 --> 01:12:50.683
"Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

01:12:51.415 --> 01:12:53.650
Amen.

01:12:53.652 --> 01:12:55.688
Now Michael'd like to say something.

01:13:01.759 --> 01:13:03.195
My mom

01:13:04.662 --> 01:13:07.462
was a saint, as you all know.

01:13:07.464 --> 01:13:09.699
She taught me the meaning of life,

01:13:09.701 --> 01:13:11.635
not by her words,

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:13.171
but by the way she lived.

01:13:14.205 --> 01:13:15.607
She had a very hard life

01:13:18.477 --> 01:13:21.177
and never once complained.

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:24.784
She took the forces of evil
that the world threw at her

01:13:27.451 --> 01:13:28.753
and stood strong.

01:13:31.455 --> 01:13:32.690
I love you, Mom.

01:13:34.759 --> 01:13:36.227
I'll see you again.

01:13:38.162 --> 01:13:39.464
I'll see you again.

01:14:08.227 --> 01:14:10.193
Thank you for coming. God bless you.

01:14:10.195 --> 01:14:11.263
Thank you.

01:14:13.165 --> 01:14:14.663
Michael,

01:14:14.665 --> 01:14:16.699
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:14:16.701 --> 01:14:19.836
If there's anything that
you need, I'm here for you.

01:14:19.838 --> 01:14:21.240
God bless you.

01:14:26.344 --> 01:14:28.744
- All right, Michael?
- Yeah.

01:14:28.746 --> 01:14:31.483
- She raised a great man.
- Yeah.

01:14:33.184 --> 01:14:35.217
Anything you need, we got you, all right?

01:14:35.219 --> 01:14:37.655
I know. You guys being here is enough.

01:14:39.624 --> 01:14:41.360
- We got you.
- Thanks, bro.

01:14:42.193 --> 01:14:43.361
Be strong.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.733
Glad you could make it.

01:14:49.735 --> 01:14:51.370
Thank you very much for coming.

01:14:54.305 --> 01:14:55.771
I'm so sorry, Michael.

01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.477
Don't let your mother's
death to be in vain.

01:15:01.146 --> 01:15:02.781
She truly believed in you,

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.280
believed that you were...

01:15:05.282 --> 01:15:07.452
That you are a very good person.

01:15:10.321 --> 01:15:11.856
And I also believe it too.

01:15:12.823 --> 01:15:14.489
So sorry.

01:15:14.491 --> 01:15:15.561
Thank you.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:19.529
It's okay.

01:15:19.531 --> 01:15:22.668
Thank you for coming. Thank
you very much for coming.

01:15:26.304 --> 01:15:29.408
Michael. She was a good woman.

01:15:32.277 --> 01:15:33.546
She was.

01:15:40.318 --> 01:15:42.321
- What's up, man?
- What's up?

01:15:44.255 --> 01:15:47.356
Hey, listen. I'm joining a
dunk competition on Saturday.

01:15:47.358 --> 01:15:48.760
Would love for you to be there.

01:15:49.727 --> 01:15:52.261
I don't think so.

01:15:52.263 --> 01:15:54.967
- I just need a little bit of time.
- I understand.

01:15:56.768 --> 01:15:58.368
Maybe we can just hang out...

01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:00.502
- Nah.
- ...and do something.

01:16:00.504 --> 01:16:02.838
I've got some things I gotta do.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:05.343
Look, I'll catch you later, all right?

01:16:10.415 --> 01:16:11.749
He'll be okay, all right?

01:16:13.619 --> 01:16:14.784
I sure hope so, man.

01:16:14.786 --> 01:16:17.354
Yeah. He just needs some time.

01:16:17.356 --> 01:16:18.654
- Nine.
- Higher.

01:16:18.656 --> 01:16:20.922
- Ten. Dunk it, dunk it.
- Higher.

01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:22.760
There we go. All right, take a rest.

01:16:26.464 --> 01:16:28.196
Yo, Mike,

01:16:28.198 --> 01:16:29.664
if you want to beat The
Jammer and that German dude,

01:16:29.666 --> 01:16:31.601
you've got to come up
with a special dunk, man.

01:16:31.603 --> 01:16:33.435
You got to.

01:16:33.437 --> 01:16:35.538
You sure you're up for this, Michael?

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:36.742
I'm doing it for my mom.

01:16:38.576 --> 01:16:41.877
She wanted me to have
another chance at something.

01:16:41.879 --> 01:16:44.279
I'm just not sure what that is yet.

01:16:44.281 --> 01:16:46.283
Winning this dunk tournament's
going to be a start.

01:16:46.285 --> 01:16:47.553
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:16:48.487 --> 01:16:50.520
No.

01:16:50.522 --> 01:16:52.457
It's something more than that.

01:16:54.692 --> 01:16:56.559
Let's keep goin'. Let's go.

01:16:56.561 --> 01:16:59.895
Come on, let's go bass fast.

01:16:59.897 --> 01:17:01.998
- There we go.
- That's right. Finish strong.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.499
- Here we go.
- Got it, right?

01:17:03.501 --> 01:17:06.338
Let's go. Two more. Two more. Come on.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:12.544
- <i>Ready? You dunk, baby.</i>
- Finish strong. Finish strong. Ah!

01:17:32.763 --> 01:17:33.898
Who are you, homie?

01:17:36.535 --> 01:17:37.769
I'm Michael.

01:17:39.269 --> 01:17:40.505
What do you want?

01:17:41.607 --> 01:17:43.509
- I want to see Taye.
- What?

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:48.877
Why you think you can just
roll up in here like that?

01:17:48.879 --> 01:17:50.646
- Man, I ain't afraid to die.
- What?

01:17:50.648 --> 01:17:51.950
Let him go!

01:17:59.357 --> 01:18:00.859
Michael, Michael.

01:18:04.362 --> 01:18:07.566
I hope for your sake that you
came with a change of heart.

01:18:08.933 --> 01:18:12.004
So? You gonna cop one
of these .44s or what?

01:18:14.572 --> 01:18:17.306
It's the only thing that's
gonna protect you out here.

01:18:17.308 --> 01:18:18.574
You know that, right?

01:18:18.576 --> 01:18:20.443
No, I don't need a gun to protect me.

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:22.311
Oh.

01:18:22.313 --> 01:18:23.980
What, you Superman now?

01:18:23.982 --> 01:18:25.984
Catching flying bullets with your teeth?

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.021
Show me.

01:18:31.723 --> 01:18:33.659
I said show me, Superman.

01:18:36.428 --> 01:18:38.030
Who's gonna save you now, Mike?

01:18:39.496 --> 01:18:41.096
God gonna protect me.

01:18:41.098 --> 01:18:43.067
Shut up!

01:18:45.469 --> 01:18:46.571
God, huh?

01:18:47.772 --> 01:18:49.375
Take a look around you, Mike.

01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:53.476
God doesn't live here anymore.

01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:54.913
He checked out a long time ago.

01:18:56.781 --> 01:18:58.484
Where is he?

01:19:04.955 --> 01:19:06.592
He's out back.

01:19:08.092 --> 01:19:09.128
I want to see him.

01:19:12.429 --> 01:19:13.464
Go get him.

01:19:18.135 --> 01:19:20.071
You must really hate guys like us, huh?

01:19:21.039 --> 01:19:22.872
Doin' time for their con.

01:19:22.874 --> 01:19:23.876
No, I don't hate you.

01:19:25.076 --> 01:19:26.943
No?

01:19:26.945 --> 01:19:29.913
Red caused you six years behind bars.

01:19:29.915 --> 01:19:32.481
He took everything away from you, right?

01:19:32.483 --> 01:19:34.650
I'm sure you hate him a little bit.

01:19:34.652 --> 01:19:35.753
Took his girl.

01:19:36.655 --> 01:19:38.821
Took your family.

01:19:38.823 --> 01:19:41.556
Your dreams and aspirations of the future.

01:19:41.558 --> 01:19:46.462
You could've been playing in the NBA
making millions of dollars, but...

01:19:46.464 --> 01:19:48.033
But instead you're here with us.

01:19:50.067 --> 01:19:51.669
How's that make you feel, Mike?

01:19:53.738 --> 01:19:56.172
Either way, I guess Red
got what he deserved, right?

01:19:56.174 --> 01:19:58.574
Three months into his sentence...

01:20:00.844 --> 01:20:02.580
He gets killed by a gang member.

01:20:06.151 --> 01:20:09.054
Red was sloppy. I'm not.

01:20:14.092 --> 01:20:15.093
Make it quick, Taye.

01:20:24.902 --> 01:20:26.037
Taye...

01:20:27.738 --> 01:20:29.474
Don't make the same mistake I made.

01:20:31.742 --> 01:20:32.977
I was a fool.

01:20:34.978 --> 01:20:38.549
I know you don't respect me.
You got every right not to.

01:20:41.887 --> 01:20:43.255
Respect God.

01:20:45.823 --> 01:20:46.955
Respect your mother.

01:20:46.957 --> 01:20:48.794
Respect your family, man.

01:20:50.862 --> 01:20:52.631
Yo, I lost it all six years ago.

01:20:54.799 --> 01:20:56.034
I was young and dumb.

01:21:00.737 --> 01:21:02.240
But I get it now.

01:21:10.214 --> 01:21:12.016
You see this white piece of paper?

01:21:15.686 --> 01:21:17.022
Man, that's you.

01:21:19.057 --> 01:21:20.626
You're clean.

01:21:22.794 --> 01:21:24.028
Not a mark on you.

01:21:26.164 --> 01:21:27.933
Man, don't ruin your life.

01:21:28.967 --> 01:21:30.067
God loves you.

01:21:32.170 --> 01:21:33.272
He loves you.

01:21:37.008 --> 01:21:38.710
Man, I don't care if they kill me.

01:21:41.112 --> 01:21:43.111
But you?

01:21:43.113 --> 01:21:45.049
You got your whole life ahead of you.

01:21:48.586 --> 01:21:51.255
My life means nothing if
you go down the same path.

01:21:53.558 --> 01:21:54.993
Lisa's gone.

01:21:57.961 --> 01:21:59.564
Mama's gone.

01:22:01.898 --> 01:22:03.901
You're the only family I have today.

01:22:06.905 --> 01:22:08.607
You're the only family I got.

01:22:11.977 --> 01:22:14.079
Mom made me promise to protect you,

01:22:16.112 --> 01:22:17.648
take care of you.

01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:22.653
That's what I'm here to do, man.

01:22:24.121 --> 01:22:25.356
I love you, man.

01:22:31.963 --> 01:22:33.165
Taye.

01:22:37.768 --> 01:22:39.236
Go with your brother, man.

01:22:44.075 --> 01:22:46.275
- Thank you.
- Hey.

01:22:46.277 --> 01:22:48.046
You still ain't better than us.

01:22:49.781 --> 01:22:51.082
I'm not.

01:22:52.784 --> 01:22:54.353
That's why I'm here.

01:22:57.188 --> 01:22:58.356
Come on, man.

01:23:08.131 --> 01:23:09.267
Hey.

01:23:09.933 --> 01:23:11.833
Hi.

01:23:11.835 --> 01:23:13.069
What are you doing?

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.337
Practicing for the slam dunk competition.

01:23:15.339 --> 01:23:17.972
Oh, right. The national championship, huh?

01:23:17.974 --> 01:23:19.074
Yeah.

01:23:19.076 --> 01:23:20.811
Wow! Can I help?

01:23:21.912 --> 01:23:23.080
I mean, if you want.

01:23:23.982 --> 01:23:25.283
Okay.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.688
I left Craig.

01:23:36.861 --> 01:23:38.793
But I thought you guys were like...

01:23:38.795 --> 01:23:42.400
Uh-uh. Let's just turn back
the time six years ago, okay?

01:23:44.869 --> 01:23:46.636
Well, if it's six years ago...

01:23:46.638 --> 01:23:48.104
Mmm-hmm.

01:23:48.106 --> 01:23:50.006
That means we're still serious.

01:23:50.008 --> 01:23:52.244
Mmm-hmm. Just like before.

01:23:53.344 --> 01:23:54.346
So kiss me.

01:23:55.746 --> 01:23:57.413
No.

01:23:57.415 --> 01:23:59.916
Not with all that sweat on your face. Ew.

01:23:59.918 --> 01:24:00.951
Come on.

01:24:02.753 --> 01:24:04.790
We have a lot of practicing to do.

01:24:13.063 --> 01:24:16.865
Hey, man, your mom would
want you to win it, all right?

01:24:16.867 --> 01:24:19.034
There's not enough time, man.

01:24:19.036 --> 01:24:20.805
The dunk contest's in two weeks.

01:24:22.939 --> 01:24:25.775
There's enough time, Michael.

01:24:25.777 --> 01:24:27.443
- You got this, kid.
- Oh, God.

01:24:27.445 --> 01:24:29.043
Keep it goin'. You can do it.

01:24:29.045 --> 01:24:30.346
- Yeah.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:24:30.348 --> 01:24:32.148
- Pick up those knees.
- Let's go.

01:24:32.150 --> 01:24:34.851
Yeah. Let's go. Higher.

01:24:34.853 --> 01:24:36.118
Higher!

01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:38.256
Here we go. Higher! Let's go, Diggs!

01:24:40.156 --> 01:24:41.858
- Yeah.
- Come on, man.

01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:43.691
Seriously, that's not gonna
beat The Jammer. Let's go!

01:24:43.693 --> 01:24:45.360
- Gotta work!
- Quicker, baby.

01:24:45.362 --> 01:24:47.363
Come on, Michael. You're not gonna beat him

01:24:47.365 --> 01:24:48.830
- if you're not working. Let's go!
- Quicker, baby. Quicker!

01:24:48.832 --> 01:24:50.469
Hold it out. Hold it out.

01:24:52.402 --> 01:24:55.072
That's good. Come on, man. Too simple.

01:24:55.973 --> 01:24:57.038
Okay.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.306
Let's go.

01:24:58.308 --> 01:25:00.243
Explosive. Explosive. There you go.

01:25:00.245 --> 01:25:01.780
- Try to get lower.
- Let's go.

01:25:04.316 --> 01:25:05.914
- Lower, lower.
- Keep going.

01:25:05.916 --> 01:25:07.783
Feel it.

01:25:07.785 --> 01:25:09.251
- Move it, baby.
- Nice work.

01:25:09.253 --> 01:25:11.020
Come on, let's go.

01:25:12.188 --> 01:25:13.191
There we go. Come on.

01:25:16.893 --> 01:25:18.895
<i>Let's get in there.
Let's get in there.</i>

01:25:18.897 --> 01:25:20.261
Let's hear it for him.
Let's hear it for him.

01:25:20.263 --> 01:25:22.931
Come on. Come on. Clap. Clap.

01:25:32.477 --> 01:25:35.444
Whew!

01:25:35.446 --> 01:25:37.079
Come on, man, you're too slow.

01:25:37.081 --> 01:25:38.780
You're slower than my grandpa.

01:25:38.782 --> 01:25:40.850
Whatever.

01:25:40.852 --> 01:25:43.787
Your grandpa's, like, 75 years
old. I don't see the comparison.

01:25:43.789 --> 01:25:46.321
- Bro. It's a metaphor.
- Okay, well...

01:25:46.323 --> 01:25:48.157
What's that?

01:25:48.159 --> 01:25:50.128
He's not, like, literally...

01:25:50.829 --> 01:25:52.861
Never mind.

01:25:52.863 --> 01:25:56.164
Well, they're gonna have the best
dunkers in the world there, Michael.

01:25:56.166 --> 01:25:57.499
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

01:25:57.501 --> 01:25:59.467
They got that one, that German dude.

01:25:59.469 --> 01:26:03.138
Frankie Fudengurstgleen...

01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:04.974
Frigginsurspleek...

01:26:04.976 --> 01:26:07.476
- Frick... Frick...
- Hey, just... Just stop.

01:26:07.478 --> 01:26:10.812
How you feeling, man? You good?

01:26:10.814 --> 01:26:12.914
- I'm good.
- You still got the hops, man.

01:26:12.916 --> 01:26:14.784
You know you got to come
with that one killer dunk

01:26:14.786 --> 01:26:16.485
to take it all, you know that, right?

01:26:16.487 --> 01:26:19.021
Yeah, I know. I've been
thinkin' about something.

01:26:19.023 --> 01:26:20.823
I just haven't attempted it yet.

01:26:20.825 --> 01:26:22.425
Why not?

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:24.062
Well, it's impossible to do.

01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:26.031
Impossible?

01:26:27.063 --> 01:26:28.200
Yeah.

01:26:35.439 --> 01:26:37.107
Impossible.

01:26:38.976 --> 01:26:41.476
Impossible? Which one is that?

01:26:41.478 --> 01:26:44.913
It's a 540 dunk. No
one's been able to do it.

01:26:44.915 --> 01:26:47.016
A 540? What's that?

01:26:47.018 --> 01:26:49.020
It's a 360 with an extra loop.

01:26:50.254 --> 01:26:52.587
- It's impossible.
- No way.

01:26:52.589 --> 01:26:55.192
<i>Everybody, what time is it?</i>

01:26:56.027 --> 01:26:57.427
<i>Here we go!</i>

01:27:04.367 --> 01:27:08.106
<i>Make some noise,
y'all! Coming up next.</i>

01:27:13.878 --> 01:27:16.078
<i>Make some noise!</i>

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:21.048
Welcome to the International Slam
Dunk Competition, Slamma Jamma,

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:24.854
where we have a one million dollar
first place prize for the winner.

01:27:24.856 --> 01:27:27.023
The world's best dunkers are here, Bob.

01:27:27.025 --> 01:27:29.057
We have a newcomer, Michael Diggs,

01:27:29.059 --> 01:27:32.194
who many remember served six years in jail.

01:27:32.196 --> 01:27:34.532
Is there room for redemption?
That's another story.

01:27:47.445 --> 01:27:51.047
<i>Let's go. Round one.
The Jammer, Round one.</i>

01:27:51.049 --> 01:27:54.083
<i>The Jammer from Canada,
people. Let's go.</i>

01:27:54.085 --> 01:27:57.285
<i>Clap. Clap. Clap. Cartwheel.</i>

01:27:57.287 --> 01:27:59.187
You way too special for
this competition, boy.

01:27:59.189 --> 01:28:00.556
This is nationals.

01:28:00.558 --> 01:28:01.990
I'll be surprised if you
even come in 10th place.

01:28:01.992 --> 01:28:03.559
Hey!

01:28:03.561 --> 01:28:05.660
- Chill, man.
- The Jammer.

01:28:05.662 --> 01:28:08.430
Think you're all cool making
millions, being a world-class dunker,

01:28:08.432 --> 01:28:10.199
havin' all the girls chasing you?

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:12.434
Well, you still be just
a high school dropout.

01:28:12.436 --> 01:28:14.136
High school dropout?

01:28:14.138 --> 01:28:16.538
I got my Masters in education.
What are you talking about?

01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:18.341
Oh, yeah?

01:28:18.343 --> 01:28:20.378
Well, can you make five tacos
blindfolded in one minute?

01:28:21.679 --> 01:28:24.012
Yeah. I bet you can't do that.

01:28:25.982 --> 01:28:27.349
Got him.

01:28:27.351 --> 01:28:28.684
<i>Round one! The Jammer...</i>

01:28:28.686 --> 01:28:30.586
Okay.

01:28:30.588 --> 01:28:33.154
The Jammer has never lost a dunk
competition in three years, guys.

01:28:33.156 --> 01:28:36.426
- <i>Clap. Clap. Clap. Cartwheel!</i>
- Wow.

01:28:36.428 --> 01:28:39.127
- <i>Out of the seat! Out of the seat!</i>
- Unbelievable!

01:28:39.129 --> 01:28:41.530
What a dunk! Oh, man.

01:28:41.532 --> 01:28:44.632
All tens. Jammer is now in first place.

01:28:44.634 --> 01:28:46.636
Wow, incredible dunk.

01:28:46.638 --> 01:28:50.306
<i>José Marks from Argentina.
Everybody, let's go, make some noise.</i>

01:28:50.308 --> 01:28:52.307
Up next is José Marks,

01:28:52.309 --> 01:28:55.177
winner of the Argentina dunk competition.

01:28:55.179 --> 01:28:58.113
- Great dunk!
- Hey!

01:28:58.115 --> 01:29:01.449
<i>Let's go, fans. Clap,
clap, clap, clap.</i>

01:29:01.451 --> 01:29:03.952
<i>Up... Between the legs dunk!</i>

01:29:03.954 --> 01:29:05.456
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:29:06.991 --> 01:29:08.556
<i>Man, that was nasty!</i>

01:29:08.558 --> 01:29:10.726
<i>Okay, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:29:10.728 --> 01:29:12.427
Next up is Michael Diggs,

01:29:12.429 --> 01:29:15.631
the former college champion
who spent six years in prison.

01:29:15.633 --> 01:29:17.565
A real tragedy.

01:29:17.567 --> 01:29:21.002
And Michael, of course, placed
second in the local dunk competition.

01:29:21.004 --> 01:29:25.207
But these are the world's greatest dunkers
vying for that million-dollar prize.

01:29:25.209 --> 01:29:28.476
And I think Michael Diggs should
count himself lucky to be here.

01:29:28.478 --> 01:29:30.178
<i>Give it up. Give it
up. Michael Diggs.</i>

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:34.650
<i>Michael. Michael. Michael! Michael!</i>

01:29:34.652 --> 01:29:39.124
<i>Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael!</i>

01:29:42.994 --> 01:29:44.560
- <i>Ah! 360!</i>
- Incredible dunk!

01:29:44.562 --> 01:29:48.029
- Oh, my... Wow!
- Spectacular dunk!

01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:51.566
Oh, that will ensure he
gets to the next round.

01:29:51.568 --> 01:29:55.337
Next up. Frank Frondheim from Germany!

01:29:55.339 --> 01:30:00.275
Frank Frondheim has a 48 vertical
leap. He's the best dunker in Germany.

01:30:00.277 --> 01:30:03.111
<i>Coming up...</i>

01:30:03.113 --> 01:30:04.579
What is he doing?

01:30:04.581 --> 01:30:07.083
<i>He don't like it. He don't like it.</i>

01:30:07.085 --> 01:30:09.685
<i>This guy's too short. He
wants to add a chair in there.</i>

01:30:09.687 --> 01:30:11.252
<i>What is he gonna do?</i>

01:30:11.254 --> 01:30:13.021
Go higher!

01:30:13.023 --> 01:30:15.024
- <i>He wants to go higher.</i>
- This is crazy.

01:30:15.026 --> 01:30:16.661
He's gonna jump over that guy?

01:30:22.098 --> 01:30:25.700
Amazing. The German is now
in first place over Jammer.

01:30:25.702 --> 01:30:28.404
<i>Goodness! Clap it up.
Clap it up. Clap it up!</i>

01:30:28.406 --> 01:30:30.806
<i>How about a round
of applause, please?</i>

01:30:30.808 --> 01:30:33.074
<i>Wow!</i>

01:30:33.076 --> 01:30:34.310
Wow, that was fantastic.

01:30:34.312 --> 01:30:36.078
<i>Whoo! Perfect tens!</i>

01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.712
<i>And now...</i>

01:30:37.714 --> 01:30:40.681
Whoa. What's Craig Jackson
doing? The NBA star?

01:30:40.683 --> 01:30:43.051
<i>Get off the roll, punk!</i>

01:30:43.053 --> 01:30:46.355
<i>Look, I'm tired of all y'all people out
here cheering for these whack dunkers</i>

01:30:46.357 --> 01:30:47.823
<i>like they're really doin' somethin'.</i>

01:30:47.825 --> 01:30:50.525
<i>You all know what's
up. Yeah, you heard me.</i>

01:30:50.527 --> 01:30:52.727
<i>It's about time Craig
Jackson came out here.</i>

01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:54.428
<i>I'm in the dunk contest, homie.</i>

01:30:54.430 --> 01:30:56.664
Sir, no, no. The rules clearly state

01:30:56.666 --> 01:30:59.133
an NBA player cannot be
part of the competition.

01:30:59.135 --> 01:31:02.203
Look, man... Bro, give me the
rules. Bro, give me the rules.

01:31:02.205 --> 01:31:05.274
I don't care about your
rules. I'm in the dunk contest.

01:31:05.276 --> 01:31:07.810
Your rules, I break 'em.
That's what it is, homie.

01:31:07.812 --> 01:31:09.212
- Okay.
- I'm making the rules.

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.613
We need to check with the judges.

01:31:10.615 --> 01:31:12.847
Yeah, go check with your
little judges, homie.

01:31:12.849 --> 01:31:16.318
<i>Dang. Is y'all ready or what?
Let me hear it. Make some noise.</i>

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.386
<i>I see you. Hey, you
got that jersey on?</i>

01:31:18.388 --> 01:31:20.288
- It looks...
- Hey!

01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:22.091
What are you doing?

01:31:22.093 --> 01:31:23.624
Lisa, get out of my face, man!

01:31:23.626 --> 01:31:26.261
- What you always coming up on me for?
- It's not right!

01:31:26.263 --> 01:31:27.628
You trippin' 'cause you
think your little boyfriend

01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:29.364
gonna lose, that a real one here?

01:31:29.366 --> 01:31:31.600
Please, don't do this.

01:31:31.602 --> 01:31:33.334
You got one choice. Listen to me.

01:31:33.336 --> 01:31:35.337
You got one choice.

01:31:35.339 --> 01:31:37.172
You drop that fool Michael

01:31:37.174 --> 01:31:39.374
and come back with me, and we good.

01:31:39.376 --> 01:31:40.775
I'm out of the contest.

01:31:40.777 --> 01:31:43.846
Otherwise, suffer the
consequences with him.

01:31:43.848 --> 01:31:45.780
He needs the money!

01:31:45.782 --> 01:31:47.619
I don't care nothin' about that.

01:31:49.486 --> 01:31:51.153
Now, as you know, Craig Jackson

01:31:51.155 --> 01:31:53.821
is the three-time NBA slam dunk champion.

01:31:53.823 --> 01:31:58.694
<i>Let's go. Let's get it. Ready?
Clap. Clap. Clap. Clap. Clap!</i>

01:31:58.696 --> 01:32:00.261
Unbelievable!

01:32:00.263 --> 01:32:02.597
They're letting Craig
Jackson in the competition.

01:32:02.599 --> 01:32:05.266
<i>Craig Jackson, everybody. Get up!</i>

01:32:06.570 --> 01:32:09.236
<i>Yay! Between the legs,</i>

01:32:09.238 --> 01:32:13.676
<i>over the dude with the nasty dunk.</i>

01:32:13.678 --> 01:32:16.145
<i>Craig Jackson, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:32:16.147 --> 01:32:18.779
And the judges give Craig all nines.

01:32:18.781 --> 01:32:20.516
A 27 for Mr. Jackson.

01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:23.584
What you gonna do? What you gonna do? Huh?

01:32:23.586 --> 01:32:25.721
<i>And the competition is heating up.</i>

01:32:25.723 --> 01:32:27.455
- Gonna stand there like a punk?
- Craig Jackson,

01:32:27.457 --> 01:32:28.523
<i>Michael Diggs.</i>

01:32:28.525 --> 01:32:30.458
<i>Crowd, make some noise.</i>

01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:33.630
Wow. It looks like Craig has
a beef with Michael Diggs.

01:32:35.198 --> 01:32:36.765
Yeah, your homies heard me, too.

01:32:36.767 --> 01:32:38.699
Bootie Josie from Kenya now up.

01:32:38.701 --> 01:32:40.435
<i>All the way from Kenya!</i>

01:32:40.437 --> 01:32:42.870
<i>Between the legs over three people!</i>

01:32:42.872 --> 01:32:45.207
<i>Whoo!</i>

01:32:45.209 --> 01:32:47.579
And the judges give him a 29.

01:32:48.845 --> 01:32:50.846
<i>Off the lob.</i>

01:32:50.848 --> 01:32:53.782
<i>360!</i>

01:32:53.784 --> 01:32:57.218
And the Argentinean hits
it, but is it enough?

01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:00.355
No! The judges rule him out.

01:33:00.357 --> 01:33:01.623
<i>In the first round he went
between the legs, 360.</i>

01:33:01.625 --> 01:33:03.225
<i>What's he gonna do?</i>

01:33:03.227 --> 01:33:04.426
<i>Over and...</i>

01:33:04.428 --> 01:33:07.229
<i>Ah!</i>

01:33:07.231 --> 01:33:11.833
<i>Whoo! Over the guy,
reverse dunk! Here we go!</i>

01:33:11.835 --> 01:33:14.869
Oh! And Frank Frondheim is getting all 10s!

01:33:14.871 --> 01:33:16.372
He's in the finals!

01:33:16.374 --> 01:33:19.274
- <i>That was nasty.</i>
- Das ist gut!

01:33:19.276 --> 01:33:21.377
So, uh, what are you gonna do?

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:24.915
I don't know.

01:33:29.452 --> 01:33:31.455
Yo, I got an idea. Follow me. Follow me.

01:33:33.223 --> 01:33:35.391
- Where did he get that shirt?
- I bought it for him.

01:33:35.393 --> 01:33:36.995
Can you get me one?

01:33:42.432 --> 01:33:46.470
It looks like Michael Diggs is
going to jump over a motorcycle.

01:33:48.638 --> 01:33:51.642
<i>This is a level 20.</i>

01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:55.380
- Is that possible?
- Oh, my gosh!

01:33:56.479 --> 01:33:58.346
<i>Over the person,</i>

01:33:58.348 --> 01:34:00.318
<i>over the motorcycle! Oh!</i>

01:34:04.789 --> 01:34:07.525
- Michael did it!
- Oh, my God!

01:34:09.793 --> 01:34:13.828
And Michael Diggs advances
to the final round.

01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:16.864
<i>Michael Diggs. Give it up for him!</i>

01:34:16.866 --> 01:34:19.368
<i>Round number two. Craig
Jackson. Let's go!</i>

01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:23.605
And this dunk could advance
Craig Jackson to the final round.

01:34:23.607 --> 01:34:26.775
- Incredible dunk!
- Oh, my! What a dunk!

01:34:26.777 --> 01:34:28.778
- <i>360 windmill!</i>
- What a dunk, baby!

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:30.745
- Baby! A winner's dunk!
- I love it!

01:34:30.747 --> 01:34:34.483
- Gonna win this thing.
- I love it! All 10s, baby. Can't see me?

01:34:34.485 --> 01:34:36.487
Now let's see what the judges give Craig.

01:34:39.423 --> 01:34:41.623
Oh, my! José gives Craig an 8!

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:43.659
Eight? Are you kidding me?

01:34:43.661 --> 01:34:45.794
- Terrell! Do something!
- I got you. Hey.

01:34:45.796 --> 01:34:47.062
- Keep your head in the game, baby.
- All right. All right. Okay.

01:34:47.064 --> 01:34:48.663
- I got you, baby.
- Stop talkin' to me.

01:34:48.665 --> 01:34:50.364
- Talk to 'em.
- I got you. I got you.

01:34:50.366 --> 01:34:51.999
Hey, José. Come on, baby.

01:34:52.001 --> 01:34:53.968
We go way back. We've always been good.

01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:55.870
I'm gonna need you to
hook a brother up on this

01:34:55.872 --> 01:34:58.039
and get that score up for me.

01:34:58.041 --> 01:35:00.476
Man, that was a boring dunk. He gets an 8.

01:35:00.478 --> 01:35:02.343
Hey, listen, I'm not askin' for something

01:35:02.345 --> 01:35:04.511
and not be willing to give something.

01:35:04.513 --> 01:35:07.917
Two tickets, floor seats,
Clipper game. And it's yours.

01:35:07.919 --> 01:35:09.918
Man, who do you think you're talking to?

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:13.020
I'm José Canseco.
MVP. 4-time All-Star.

01:35:13.022 --> 01:35:16.091
First player to hit 30 home runs
for four different ball clubs.

01:35:16.093 --> 01:35:17.993
Beloved by millions of fans.

01:35:17.995 --> 01:35:20.061
You actually think I would stoop so low

01:35:20.063 --> 01:35:22.498
for two Clipper tickets?

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.498
You're right. Make it four.

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:25.635
You got a deal.

01:35:26.536 --> 01:35:28.736
My man.

01:35:28.738 --> 01:35:30.439
- Bam!
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:35:30.441 --> 01:35:31.940
Right back where we need to be!

01:35:31.942 --> 01:35:33.542
- I knew you got it, baby.
- I got you, baby.

01:35:33.544 --> 01:35:35.543
That's what's up, baby. That's what's up.

01:35:35.545 --> 01:35:40.882
Oh, no! José just changed his score
from an 8 to a 10 for Craig Jackson!

01:35:40.884 --> 01:35:42.449
What?

01:35:42.451 --> 01:35:43.886
What is going on?

01:35:43.888 --> 01:35:45.386
I changed my mind, okay?

01:35:45.388 --> 01:35:47.388
Well, that's wrong!

01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:50.859
- I mean...
- Mr. Canseco. Mr. Canseco.

01:35:50.861 --> 01:35:53.664
Why'd you change your
score? I looked up to you.

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:57.833
Welcome to the real world, kid.

01:35:57.835 --> 01:35:59.534
Bill, who do you think will win?

01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:01.470
Well, my favorite of
course, is still, the Jammer.

01:36:01.472 --> 01:36:03.439
I mean, even over the German.

01:36:03.441 --> 01:36:05.440
I mean, he's already won the
contest three years in a row,

01:36:05.442 --> 01:36:07.141
and he just keeps
getting better and better.

01:36:07.143 --> 01:36:09.544
And what about the crowd
favorite Michael Diggs?

01:36:09.546 --> 01:36:10.812
Unfortunately, no.

01:36:10.814 --> 01:36:12.513
He's too old,

01:36:12.515 --> 01:36:14.417
and you saw he barely made
it to the second round.

01:36:14.419 --> 01:36:16.450
I'm sorry, but his days are over.

01:36:16.452 --> 01:36:17.985
Well, we will see.

01:36:17.987 --> 01:36:20.555
We'll be right back after
this commercial break.

01:36:22.092 --> 01:36:24.159
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

01:36:24.161 --> 01:36:25.694
I was wondering.

01:36:25.696 --> 01:36:26.994
Have you ever played basketball before?

01:36:26.996 --> 01:36:28.797
- Uh, me? No.
- Okay.

01:36:28.799 --> 01:36:30.865
Then why do you criticize those that do?

01:36:30.867 --> 01:36:31.967
I'm just wondering.

01:36:31.969 --> 01:36:33.467
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:36:33.469 --> 01:36:35.002
I'm a friend of Michael Diggs.

01:36:35.004 --> 01:36:36.971
I just don't really appreciate

01:36:36.973 --> 01:36:39.740
how you disrespected him like
that on national television.

01:36:39.742 --> 01:36:42.077
I'm a sports critic. That's what we do.

01:36:42.079 --> 01:36:44.113
Oh, a sports critic. Okay.

01:36:44.115 --> 01:36:46.181
You seem like a guy who's never been picked

01:36:46.183 --> 01:36:47.983
to play basketball. Am I right?

01:36:47.985 --> 01:36:49.650
Excuse me?

01:36:49.652 --> 01:36:51.086
I already told you that
I didn't play basketball.

01:36:51.088 --> 01:36:52.921
Therefore, you couldn't pick me.

01:36:52.923 --> 01:36:55.923
I wouldn't give you the chance
to reject me. You understand?

01:36:55.925 --> 01:36:59.127
You can't reject me. How
dare you criticize me?

01:36:59.129 --> 01:37:01.128
- Bill?
- Bill, we're on.

01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:02.763
You come over here and tell me
that I can't criticize people?

01:37:02.765 --> 01:37:04.632
See, I am a professional sports critic.

01:37:04.634 --> 01:37:06.501
That's what I do. See, you don't understand

01:37:06.503 --> 01:37:08.203
because you've never criticized anybody

01:37:08.205 --> 01:37:10.172
- on a professional level like me.
- Bill... We're on...

01:37:10.174 --> 01:37:12.039
Who do you think you are,
you little hoopster hood rat,

01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:13.441
coming over here and messing with me?

01:37:13.443 --> 01:37:14.508
Give me a break. Get outta here.

01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:15.577
- Bill!
- What?

01:37:15.579 --> 01:37:16.981
We're on national TV.

01:37:19.683 --> 01:37:22.650
I... was just talking
to my buddy over here.

01:37:22.652 --> 01:37:24.685
We're good friends from way back.

01:37:24.687 --> 01:37:26.453
I've never seen you before,

01:37:26.455 --> 01:37:28.489
so obviously you're a liar

01:37:28.491 --> 01:37:31.193
and a very awful critic, so good luck, pal.

01:37:31.195 --> 01:37:33.494
Oh!

01:37:33.496 --> 01:37:37.168
And now, here we are at the final round.

01:37:41.504 --> 01:37:42.939
I wish you the best, man.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:46.842
Man, why'd you do it?

01:37:46.844 --> 01:37:48.208
When I was a kid, I used
to look up to you, man.

01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:49.579
I used to watch you all the time.

01:37:50.746 --> 01:37:52.180
We all make mistakes.

01:37:52.182 --> 01:37:53.614
I ain't even tryin' to hear that, man.

01:37:53.616 --> 01:37:55.048
I ain't trying to hear that.

01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:56.651
<i>All right. Here we go. This is it.</i>

01:37:56.653 --> 01:37:59.988
<i>Round number three. This
is the grand finale.</i>

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:03.926
<i>If he hits this dunk, he
may be crowned our champion.</i>

01:38:03.928 --> 01:38:05.828
<i>Let's go. Make some noise!</i>

01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:09.030
Each contestant gets one
dunk in the final round.

01:38:09.032 --> 01:38:10.832
Up now is Jammer.

01:38:10.834 --> 01:38:13.135
- <i>Can he do it?</i>
- What dunk will he do?

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:15.736
<i>Over the guy...</i>

01:38:15.738 --> 01:38:17.672
- Oh! And he's out.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:38:17.674 --> 01:38:19.673
Jammer is out of the tournament!

01:38:19.675 --> 01:38:21.909
Bill, what do you think of that?

01:38:21.911 --> 01:38:24.511
Unbelievable. He was my favorite.

01:38:24.513 --> 01:38:26.515
<i>And that's it. The
Jammer's eliminated.</i>

01:38:26.517 --> 01:38:27.983
<i>Make some noise for The Jammer!</i>

01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:29.284
All right. Incredible.

01:38:29.286 --> 01:38:32.052
Three-time champion is
out of the competition!

01:38:32.054 --> 01:38:34.890
<i>All right. This is it.
Round number three.</i>

01:38:34.892 --> 01:38:37.758
<i>This is the grand
finale, right here.</i>

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:43.230
<i>We got our man, the
German. Make some noise!</i>

01:38:43.232 --> 01:38:44.699
<i>All right. This is it.</i>

01:38:44.701 --> 01:38:48.235
<i>Frank Frondheim from
Germany, let's go!</i>

01:38:50.874 --> 01:38:53.675
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- And that might do it.

01:38:53.677 --> 01:38:55.543
He may be our champion!

01:38:55.545 --> 01:38:58.814
- The guy from Germany.
- 360 through the legs! Whoo!

01:38:58.816 --> 01:39:00.651
<i>That was a nasty dunk.</i>

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:07.654
<i>Give it up for Frank Frondheim!</i>

01:39:18.803 --> 01:39:20.868
Wow! And the judges give him all 10s...

01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:23.038
Except for one 9.

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:25.807
- And now Craig Jackson's up.
- Give it up, give it up.

01:39:25.809 --> 01:39:28.043
He has one dunk to win it.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:29.977
- <i>Oh!</i>
- And he's out!

01:39:29.979 --> 01:39:31.980
Craig Jackson is out.

01:39:31.982 --> 01:39:33.217
<i>He tried.</i>

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.787
<i>Sorry, Craig. That's
a technical foul.</i>

01:39:45.996 --> 01:39:47.361
All right, what are you gonna do?

01:39:47.363 --> 01:39:49.632
Hey, you don't have to
do anything spectacular.

01:39:49.634 --> 01:39:52.033
You just gotta dunk and you win.

01:39:52.035 --> 01:39:53.237
What you gonna do, man?

01:39:55.071 --> 01:39:56.406
The impossible.

01:39:57.808 --> 01:40:01.379
That's crazy. That's crazy.

01:40:07.017 --> 01:40:09.684
He is in a virtual tie right
now with Frank Frondheim,

01:40:09.686 --> 01:40:12.620
unless he misses his final dunk.

01:40:12.622 --> 01:40:15.923
<i>All right, this is
it! Our grand finale!</i>

01:40:15.925 --> 01:40:18.392
<i>Round number 3. Michael Diggs.</i>

01:40:18.394 --> 01:40:19.993
<i>If he makes this dunk,</i>

01:40:19.995 --> 01:40:22.663
<i>he is our million-dollar champion!</i>

01:40:22.665 --> 01:40:24.399
<i>You are Michael Diggs.</i>

01:40:24.401 --> 01:40:25.867
<i>Or was I mistaken?</i>

01:40:25.869 --> 01:40:27.368
<i>In another life.</i>

01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:30.137
<i>No. You are still Michael Diggs.</i>

01:40:30.139 --> 01:40:32.940
<i>God will be with us, son.</i>

01:40:32.942 --> 01:40:35.209
<i>This is it! Make
some noise! Let's go!</i>

01:40:38.013 --> 01:40:42.318
<i>The international slam dunk
championship, Michael Diggs!</i>

01:40:43.687 --> 01:40:45.052
<i>Say it with me!</i>

01:40:45.054 --> 01:40:49.856
<i>Michael! Michael! Michael! Michael!</i>

01:40:49.858 --> 01:40:51.993
Michael! Michael!

01:40:51.995 --> 01:40:54.730
Michael! Michael! Michael!

01:40:54.732 --> 01:40:56.096
<i>Michael Diggs!</i>

01:40:56.098 --> 01:40:58.999
Michael! Michael! Michael!

01:40:59.001 --> 01:41:02.102
Michael! Michael! Michael!

01:41:02.104 --> 01:41:05.342
Michael! Michael!

01:41:16.452 --> 01:41:18.153
<i>Michael Diggs!</i>

01:41:18.155 --> 01:41:21.890
He just did the impossible! A 540 dunk!

01:41:21.892 --> 01:41:25.828
No one has been able to do it! Not even MJ!

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:28.332
Amazing! He's our champion!

01:41:33.737 --> 01:41:35.904
<i>Michael Diggs!</i>

01:41:35.906 --> 01:41:38.776
<i>Michael Diggs, the champion now!</i>

01:41:48.751 --> 01:41:50.785
Michael...

01:41:50.787 --> 01:41:52.820
Oh, wow! He just did the impossible.

01:41:52.822 --> 01:41:54.290
- A 540!
- Good work!

01:42:01.866 --> 01:42:03.864
<i>Michael Diggs!</i>

01:42:03.866 --> 01:42:07.368
<i>Michael Diggs the champion now!</i>

01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:08.539
Champ!

01:42:10.106 --> 01:42:11.108
Yeah!

01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:15.310
Yeah!

01:42:15.312 --> 01:42:17.078
We did it, man. We did it! We did it!

01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:18.779
Ha-ha. We did it.

01:42:18.781 --> 01:42:19.914
Congratulations, man.

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:21.783
That's the best dunk I've ever seen.

01:42:21.785 --> 01:42:23.784
- You earned it.
- Thanks, Jose. Appreciate it.

01:42:23.786 --> 01:42:26.053
- Congratulations, Michael.
- Thank you.

01:42:26.055 --> 01:42:27.788
Now, I haven't forgiven myself.

01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:30.492
Don't worry about it. I forgive you.

01:42:30.494 --> 01:42:32.228
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Michael.

01:42:35.999 --> 01:42:37.334
You are a good dunker.

01:42:38.235 --> 01:42:40.101
Talented man.

01:42:40.103 --> 01:42:42.235
- God bless you.
- Thanks, man.

01:42:42.237 --> 01:42:43.941
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

01:42:47.044 --> 01:42:49.343
- Man, you did your thing, man.
- Thanks, man.

01:42:49.345 --> 01:42:51.312
Every man can redeem
himself from time to time.

01:42:51.314 --> 01:42:53.146
Man, this is for everybody.

01:42:53.148 --> 01:42:54.882
I feel you, man.

01:42:54.884 --> 01:42:56.320

He wants you in the NBA.

01:44:11.394 --> 01:44:12.560
- Thank you, sir.
- Give me a call.

Man, listen, baby.
