WEBVTT

00:06.507 --> 00:09.810
It's not as fast
as the human eye

00:09.910 --> 00:12.080
so like every--

00:12.180 --> 00:15.749
when you're looking at--
when the lens looks at stuff

00:15.849 --> 00:19.187
everything seems
much faster.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.354
THAT'S REALLY COOL.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.790
- IT LOOKS AMAZING.
- Yup.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.558
SO HOW ARE YOU DOING
IN SCHOOL?

00:24.658 --> 00:27.728
- Good good.
- HOW ARE YOU DOING
IN ENGLISH?

00:27.828 --> 00:29.363
Pretty well.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.433
SO WHAT SUBJECT ARE YOU
NOT DOING SO WELL IN?

00:32.533 --> 00:36.170
- YOUR MOM SAID THAT--
- Writing.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.039
WRITING.
SHE SAID THAT YOU GOT
A C IN THAT.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.309
It's no big deal, Dad.
It's just one C.

00:41.409 --> 00:44.978
OKAY.
ON YOUR NEXT REPORT,

00:45.079 --> 00:47.381
WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME HELP YOU?

00:47.481 --> 00:50.751
YOU CAN EMAIL IT TO ME AND WE
CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.254
- OKAY?
- Email it?

00:53.354 --> 00:55.189
- Are you joking?
- NO.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.991
- ( knocking )
- GOD.

00:58.092 --> 01:01.662
UM, CAN YOU HOLD ON
FOR A SECOND?

01:03.497 --> 01:07.401
OKAY, MAX.
I'VE GOT TO GO, UNFORTUNATELY.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.537
I'VE GOT A--
I'VE GOT A PATIENT
COMING TO SEE ME.

01:09.637 --> 01:12.973
You don't have
patients this late.
Is it a girlfriend?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.875
NO, IT'S NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.977
IT'S A PATIENT
WHO LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.047
I'D TELL YOU IF I HAD
A GIRLFRIEND.

01:20.148 --> 01:22.516
No you wouldn't.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.419
I'VE GOT TO GO NOW,
MAX, OKAY?

01:25.519 --> 01:28.189
I'LL TALK TO YOU
REAL SOON, OKAY?

01:28.289 --> 01:31.159
Have fun with
your girlfriend.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.706
- HELLO.
- I'VE COME TO COLLECT
THE TURTLE.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.775
OF COURSE.
COME ON IN.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.445
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW MY SON HAD A TURTLE

01:51.545 --> 01:54.948
UNTIL THIS MORNING.
I HAVEN'T SEEN OLIVER
ALL WEEK, SO...

01:55.048 --> 01:57.485
WELL, I-I'LL GET HIM
FOR YOU IN A SECOND.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.354
HE'S BEEN-- HE'S BEEN
IN MY KITCHEN LIVING--

02:00.454 --> 02:02.723
LIVING THE GOOD LIFE.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.562
YEAH, OLIVER'S BEEN
WITH LUKE ALL WEEK.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.399
HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME,
OR SO LUKE SAYS.

02:11.499 --> 02:15.135
SO I FIGURED
WHY SPOIL THE PARTY?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.104
IT WAS NICE
HAVING A WEEKEND.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.307
I ACTUALLY FINISHED
"MIDDLEMARCH."

02:19.407 --> 02:22.142
I THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY
ONE I KNOW WHO HAS.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.178
DOES IT END WELL?

02:24.278 --> 02:26.747
UM, I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.516
( both chuckle )

02:28.616 --> 02:31.419
OH, AND PLUS I HAD
A THREE-HOUR PHONE CALL
WITH MY SISTER,

02:31.519 --> 02:34.522
WHICH WAS ACTUALLY
PRETTY HARROWING.

02:34.622 --> 02:38.459
BUT AT LEAST NOW
I'VE DONE MY DUTY, SO...

02:39.727 --> 02:41.995
WELL, I--

02:42.095 --> 02:44.898
I-I FOUND THIS
SHOEBOX FOR--

02:44.998 --> 02:47.000
FOR SAFE TRAVEL.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.136
I'M SORRY
FOR ALL THE TROUBLE.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.605
OH, IT'S REALLY
NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.575
UM, ACTUALLY HE WAS
GOOD COMPANY.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.177
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT
LEAVING HIM ALONE,

02:57.278 --> 02:59.980
BUT I GUESS TURTLES ARE

03:00.080 --> 03:01.549
PRETTY SELF-SUFFICIENT.

03:02.983 --> 03:05.152
YEAH, AND I BAKED
YOU SOME COOKIES.

03:05.253 --> 03:07.788
I MEAN, NOT JUST FOR YOU.
I DID A LOT OF BAKING

03:07.888 --> 03:09.156
OVER THE WEEKEND.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.392
THAT'S REAL SWEET OF YOU.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.427
YEAH, I MADE
TOO MUCH AND...

03:13.527 --> 03:16.930
THE TURTLE, IT'S WAY
ABOVE AND BEYOND
THE CALL OF DUTY.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.700
- OH.
- ( laughs )

03:19.800 --> 03:21.769
THANK YOU.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.205
OKAY, SO I'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR EVENING.

03:25.306 --> 03:28.376
- SEE YOU WEDNESDAY, 4:00.
- GOOD NIGHT.

03:32.980 --> 03:36.284
( theme music playing )

03:59.840 --> 04:01.842
SO...

04:01.942 --> 04:04.545
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

04:12.620 --> 04:14.688
Paul:
HOW WAS YOUR WEEK?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.990
GREAT.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.559
GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.895
AND WHAT WAS GREAT
ABOUT IT, OLIVER?

04:21.995 --> 04:24.965
- I STAYED AT MY DAD'S.
- OH, ALL WEEK?

04:25.065 --> 04:27.868
WE WENT TO
A BASKETBALL GAME
AND WE SAT UP CLOSE.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.571
MY FEELING IS EVERY NEW YORK
KID SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE

04:30.671 --> 04:34.174
TO GO TO THE GARDEN
AND WATCH THE KNICKS SUFFER
A HUMILIATING DEFEAT.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.709
( chuckles )

04:35.809 --> 04:37.545
Oliver:
AND WE WATCHED
"THE GODFATHER."

04:37.645 --> 04:40.180
THAT'S A PRETTY COOL MOVIE.
I HAD NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.616
TELL PAUL WHAT YOU SAID
WHEN WE WATCHED IT.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.252
WHAT YOU DECIDED YOU WANTED
TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.455
OH, I WANT TO BE
A CONSINGULARY.

04:47.555 --> 04:50.157
A CONSIGLIERE.
( laughs )

04:50.257 --> 04:52.526
WHAT ELSE DID WE DO?

04:52.626 --> 04:55.496
WE WENT TO THE MET
AND SAW ARMS AND ARMOR

04:55.596 --> 04:57.765
AND BOUGHT SOME POSTERS
FOR HIS ROOM.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.967
DID YOU HAVE
ANY TROUBLE SLEEPING?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.403
HE WAS OUT LIKE A LIGHT
THE SECOND HIS HEAD
HIT THE PILLOW.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.937
WE WERE RUNNING AROUND
THE CITY SO MUCH.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.507
AND DID YOUR DAD
HAVE THE RIGHT KIND
OF FOOD FOR YOU?

05:06.607 --> 05:08.108
Oliver:
WE WENT OUT
TO EAT EVERY NIGHT.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.177
GUESS WHAT I LIKE NOW?
PAELLA.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.446
Luke:
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE
ABOUT PAELLA?

05:12.546 --> 05:14.748
EVERYTHING GOOD
IS IN PAELLA.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.818
SO IT WAS JUST YOU
AND YOUR DAD ALL WEEK?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.387
NONE OF YOUR DAD'S FRIENDS
CAME OVER?

05:19.487 --> 05:21.121
OH, THEY CAME OVER
TO WATCH FOOTBALL,

05:21.221 --> 05:23.791
BUT AT HALFTIME
WE PLAYED WII GOLF

05:23.891 --> 05:25.726
AND I BEAT EVERYBODY.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.729
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD
A REALLY GOOD TIME.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.265
WAS THERE ANY TIME
TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK?

05:32.366 --> 05:34.134
HEY, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

05:34.234 --> 05:37.037
JUST IF YOU GUYS WERE
EATING OUT EVERY NIGHT
AND WATCHING MOVIES

05:37.137 --> 05:39.707
AND RUNNING AROUND
THE CITY, WHEN DID OLIVER
HAVE TIME TO DO HIS HOMEWORK?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.308
I GOT IT ALL DONE.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.377
THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY
TRUE, IS IT?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.178
'CAUSE I FOUND OUT
THAT ONE OF YOUR ASSIGNMENTS

05:45.278 --> 05:47.147
WAS TO TAKE CARE
OF A TURTLE.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.883
DID YOU APOLOGIZE TO PAUL
FOR MAKING HIM DO THAT?

05:49.983 --> 05:53.220
- I'M SORRY.
- Paul: IT'S NO PROBLEM.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.888
ANYWAY, I'M GLAD
YOU GOT HIM BACK.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.558
I KNOW YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT HIM LAST WEEK.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.159
BUT YOU FORGOT ALL
ABOUT HIM WHEN YOU
WERE AT YOUR DAD'S.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.228
CAN'T YOU JUST CUT
THE KID SOME SLACK?

06:01.328 --> 06:02.996
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS
HAD A GOOD TIME.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.699
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT HOMEWORK AND SCHOOL
COME FIRST FOR OLIVER.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.502
I GOT ALL
OF MY HOMEWORK DONE.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.838
- DID YOU?
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.040
NINA CAME OVER AND HELPED
ME FINISH IT ALL.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.314
I'M SORRY,

06:21.415 --> 06:23.651
WHO'S-- WHO'S NINA?

06:25.118 --> 06:28.622
UM...
MY GIRLFRIEND.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.998
SO OLIVER MET
YOUR GIRLFRIEND THIS WEEK?

06:39.433 --> 06:41.635
THIS PERSON IS STAYING
AT YOUR APARTMENT?

06:41.735 --> 06:43.704
NOT STAYING.
SHE CAME OVER A FEW TIMES

06:43.804 --> 06:45.405
TO HELP OLIVER
WITH HIS HOMEWORK.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.275
DIDN'T WE CLEARLY AGREE
IT WAS TOO SOON FOR THAT?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.743
YOU HEARD HIM,
RIGHT, PAUL?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.780
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
THE KID HAD A GREAT WEEK.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.048
YOU HEARD HIM.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.884
OLIVER,

06:56.984 --> 07:00.788
HOW DID IT FEEL TO SPEND
TIME WITH NINA?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.490
IT WAS OKAY.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.558
SHE ONLY CAME OVER
TWO OR THREE TIMES.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.159
SHE WENT WITH US
TO ARMS AND ARMOR.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.795
IT WAS HER IDEA.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.362
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
ANYTHING BEFORE?

07:09.463 --> 07:10.664
DID YOUR DAD TELL YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.800
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO GET YOU SAD.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.968
Bess: OH.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.705
SO NOW HE'S TELLING OLIVER
TO KEEP SECRETS FROM ME.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.541
NO, I JUST WANTED
TO AVOID THIS EXACT
KIND OF CONVERSATION.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.443
Paul:
LUKE, I WONDER
IF YOU CAN SEE HOW

07:23.544 --> 07:26.013
UPSETTING THAT MIGHT
BE TO BESS.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.982
THE WAY SHE SEES IT,

07:29.082 --> 07:32.620
YOU'VE ASKED OLIVER TO KEEP
A SECRET FROM HER.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.355
BUT IT ENDED UP
BEING A GREAT WEEK.
ALL WENT WELL.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.225
I DON'T SEE WHY EVERYBODY
WANTS TO MAKE THIS HARDER
THAN IT REALLY IS.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.093
DON'T WE HAVE ENOUGH
UPHEAVAL GOING ON

07:40.193 --> 07:42.262
WITHOUT BRINGING SOME STRANGE
WOMAN INTO THE MIX?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.997
MOM, I ALREADY KNEW NINA.

07:47.367 --> 07:51.471
HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU KNOW NINA?

07:53.240 --> 07:55.643
SHE WAS MY TEACHER
LAST YEAR.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.946
NINA CABOT,

07:59.046 --> 08:01.081
HIS HOMEROOM TEACHER?

08:01.181 --> 08:02.883
FROM LAST YEAR

08:02.983 --> 08:05.252
WHEN HE WAS IN
THE LOWER SCHOOL.

08:05.352 --> 08:08.255
- OH.
- HE'S ON A WHOLE
DIFFERENT FLOOR NOW.

08:08.355 --> 08:11.659
OH, THAT REALLY PUTS
MY MIND AT EASE.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.027
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN DATING HER?

08:14.127 --> 08:16.897
A MONTH.
SIX WEEKS.

08:20.868 --> 08:24.805
OLIVER, IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO
SAY ABOUT THIS?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.542
WHATEVER I SAY

08:28.642 --> 08:30.944
MAKES EVERYTHING WORSE.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.685
OLIVER, TELL YOU WHAT:

08:37.785 --> 08:40.621
WHY DON'T YOU AND I GO
INTO THE WAITING ROOM

08:40.721 --> 08:43.123
AND WE JUST TAKE
A FEW MINUTES?

08:43.223 --> 08:46.293
GIVE YOUR MOM AND DAD
SOME TIME TOGETHER, OKAY?

08:46.393 --> 08:48.528
OKAY.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.707
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

09:04.344 --> 09:05.813
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID ANYTHING.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.181
I'M GLAD YOU TOLD
THE TRUTH.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.686
I THOUGHT IF I STAYED
AT MY DAD'S EVERYBODY
WOULD BE HAPPY.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.856
BUT THEY'RE FIGHTING AGAIN.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.158
WELL...

09:18.258 --> 09:21.561
YOU CERTAINLY DON'T NEED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING
A GOOD TIME AT YOUR DAD'S.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.597
IT WASN'T SO GREAT.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.733
REALLY?
BUT YOU--

09:25.833 --> 09:28.535
YOU SAID IN THERE
THAT YOU HAD FUN.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.971
I DID HAVE FUN.
BUT THE KNICKS LOST.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.906
( chuckles )

09:33.006 --> 09:35.342
IT WAS STILL HARD
FOR ME TO FALL ASLEEP.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.844
REALLY?

09:36.944 --> 09:39.246
MY DAD CHECKED ON ME,
SO I PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.182
SOMETIMES HE SITS
AT MY DESK AND WATCHES ME.

09:42.282 --> 09:45.152
AND I TRY REALLY HARD
NOT TO OPEN MY EYES.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.655
SO WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE

09:47.755 --> 09:50.390
TO HAVE YOUR DAD
WATCHING YOU LIKE THAT?

09:50.490 --> 09:53.293
IT FELT LIKE
HE WAS A SOLDIER.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.630
YOU KNOW,
LIKE GUARDING ME.

09:57.731 --> 10:01.468
GUARDING YOU FROM WHAT?

10:01.568 --> 10:04.805
HE WANTS ME TO BE ASLEEP,
EXCEPT I'M NOT.

10:04.905 --> 10:08.375
SO I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL HIM THAT.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.177
YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY HIM

10:10.277 --> 10:13.480
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.983
WELL, I CAN'T SLEEP
AT MY MOM'S EITHER.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.118
DO YOU PRETEND TO BE
ASLEEP THERE AS WELL?

10:18.218 --> 10:20.453
I DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE ANYWHERE.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.857
I JUST WISH THERE WAS SOMEPLACE
I DID FEEL COMFORTABLE.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.126
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

10:27.594 --> 10:30.698
DID YOU LIKE SPENDING
TIME WITH NINA?

10:34.634 --> 10:36.536
I MISS MY MOM.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.539
I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE
YOUR MOM VERY MUCH.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.343
AND I'M SURE THAT SHE
MISSES YOU TOO.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.679
SHE CALLED EVERY NIGHT.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.315
I TOLD HER I WAS FINE,
BUT SHE SOUNDED SAD.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.618
DID YOU FIND IT HARD
NOT TO TELL HER ABOUT--

10:51.719 --> 10:53.020
ABOUT NINA?

10:53.120 --> 10:55.255
MY DAD SAID
IF WE TOLD HER

10:55.355 --> 10:57.490
SHE WOULD GET UPSET.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.693
AND SHE DID.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.662
DO YOU FEEL THAT

11:02.763 --> 11:05.198
YOU HAVE TO KEEP SECRETS
FROM YOUR MOM AND DAD

11:05.298 --> 11:08.301
SO THAT THEY WON'T GET
ANGRY OR UPSET?

11:08.401 --> 11:09.970
Luke:
THIS ISN'T ABOUT NINA.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.805
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
WANTING CONTROL.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.440
Bess:
NO, IT'S ABOUT YOU
BEING AN ASSHOLE.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.876
WILL YOU KEEP
YOUR VOICE DOWN?

11:18.345 --> 11:22.049
OLIVER, I KNOW THAT YOU
WANT TO HELP THEM.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.754
BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP THEM
FROM BEING ANGRY OR SAD.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.757
I JUST WISH NONE
OF THIS EVER HAPPENED.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.426
I HEAR YOU.

11:35.863 --> 11:38.431
YOU KNOW,
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME

11:38.531 --> 11:40.400
WATCHING YOUR TURTLE.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.369
I THOUGHT

11:42.469 --> 11:44.404
HOW HE CARRIES
THAT HOUSE

11:44.504 --> 11:46.639
ON HIS BACK
WHEREVER HE GOES.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.642
THAT'S WHY TURTLES
ARE SO SLOW.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.045
THEY'RE ALWAYS WALKING
AROUND WITH THEIR HOUSES.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.117
ANYTHING ELSE YOU NOTICED
ABOUT THE TURTLE?

11:57.217 --> 12:00.087
NOT REALLY.
I JUST GOT HIM BACK
THIS MORNING.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.722
YOU SPENT MORE TIME
WITH HIM THAN I DID.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.858
THAT'S TRUE.
( chuckles )

12:04.958 --> 12:07.227
I DID NOTICE ONE THING.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.929
YEAH?

12:09.029 --> 12:11.799
WHEN MY MOM MET ME AT SCHOOL
TO BRING ME THE TURTLE,

12:11.899 --> 12:13.867
IT WAS IN A SHOEBOX.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.069
I THOUGHT IT WAS MINE
BUT SHE SAID IT WAS YOURS.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.806
AND WHAT MADE YOU THINK
IT WAS YOURS?

12:18.906 --> 12:22.109
'CAUSE IT WAS FOR
A KID'S SNEAKER.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.610
I ASKED MY MOM.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.179
SHE SAID MAYBE
YOU HAVE A SON.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.215
DO YOU?

12:28.315 --> 12:30.683
ARE YOU WONDERING WHAT KIND
OF DAD I WOULD BE?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.319
I BET YOU'RE A GOOD DAD.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.754
YOU SOUND PRETTY SURE
ABOUT THAT.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.457
'CAUSE YOU LISTEN TO ME.

12:40.127 --> 12:43.430
SO DO YOU HAVE A SON OR ARE YOU
GONNA MAKE ME GUESS?

12:44.865 --> 12:46.800
OKAY, FOR NOW LET'S SAY

12:46.900 --> 12:49.202
THAT I DO HAVE A SON.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.739
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.407
WELL, I THINK HE
DOESN'T LIVE HERE.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.344
NOT MOST OF THE TIME.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.112
HOW COME?

12:59.212 --> 13:01.014
'CAUSE I COME HERE
RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL

13:01.114 --> 13:03.817
AND IF HE LIVED HERE
I'D SEE HIM COMING HOME
FROM SCHOOL TOO.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.486
SO WHERE DO YOU THINK
HE DOES LIVE?

13:06.586 --> 13:08.521
PROBABLY WITH HIS MOM.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.927
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
THAT'S LIKE FOR HIM?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.896
MAYBE HE'S LONELY.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.298
HE PROBABLY MISSES
SEEING YOU ALL THE TIME.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.501
ANYTHING ELSE?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.873
I'D WANT TO MEET HIM.

13:25.973 --> 13:29.142
OH, WHY WOULD YOU
LIKE TO MEET HIM?

13:29.242 --> 13:31.078
I DON'T KNOW.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.614
JUST TO TALK TO SOMEONE
LIKE ME.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.049
I GUESS IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO HAVE A FRIEND

13:36.149 --> 13:38.018
WHO'S GOING THROUGH
THE SAME STUFF, YEAH.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.621
DOES HE HAVE
ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.924
WOULD THAT MAKE
A DIFFERENCE?

13:44.024 --> 13:46.259
IT'D MAKE IT EASIER.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.266
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
A BROTHER OR SISTER?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.169
I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET ONE,

13:56.269 --> 13:58.305
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE'S COMING ANYMORE.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.174
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.543
WELL, MY PARENTS WERE GOING
TO ADOPT A BABY BOY.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.980
THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO FLY SOMEPLACE IN AFRICA
TO GET HIM.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.616
MY MOM SHOWED ME
HIS PICTURES.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.919
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

14:12.019 --> 14:13.954
THEY JUST STOPPED
TALKING ABOUT HIM.

14:14.054 --> 14:16.623
AND THEN MY DAD
MOVED OUT.

14:18.758 --> 14:22.562
SO SINCE THEN
THEY HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO
YOU ABOUT THE ADOPTION?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.735
MAYBE HE'S--

14:28.835 --> 14:33.673
MAYBE HE'S STILL WAITING
FOR MY MOM AND DAD
TO COME GET HIM.

14:33.773 --> 14:36.709
MAYBE IF THEY DON'T
GET A DIVORCE HE'LL
COME LIVE WITH US.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.645
I DON'T KNOW.

14:40.780 --> 14:44.351
THAT'S A BIG THING
NOT TO KNOW, OLIVER.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.391
DO I HAVE TO GO
BACK IN THERE?

14:51.491 --> 14:53.927
CAN'T YOU JUST TALK
TO THEM BY YOURSELF?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.296
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.069
WON'T BE LONG.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.077
YOU LEFT THE TWO OF US ALONE
IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.445
YOU SURE LIKE TO LIVE
DANGEROUSLY, DON'T YOU?

15:12.545 --> 15:15.282
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
THE TWO OF YOU TO CONTINUE

15:15.382 --> 15:17.450
TALKING ABOUT NINA
IN FRONT OF OLIVER.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.920
YOU MEAN HOW LUKE'S
BEEN FUCKING OLIVER'S
23-YEAR-OLD SCHOOLTEACHER?

15:21.021 --> 15:23.556
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING
REALLY WELL IN HERE SO FAR.
CAN'T YOU TELL?

15:23.656 --> 15:26.826
OR HOW YOU'VE BEEN USING
OLIVER TO GET LAID?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.295
I KNEW OLIVER LIKED HER.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.797
SO I WANTED TO TALK
TO HER ABOUT HOW THINGS

15:30.897 --> 15:32.665
WERE GOING FOR HIM
AT SCHOOL THIS YEAR.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.467
I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BIG PLAN.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.437
AND SHE LIKES HIM.
SHE HELPS HIM WITH
HIS HOMEWORK.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.906
SHE'S A GOOD PERSON.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

15:40.007 --> 15:43.143
WE HAD AGREED IT WAS TOO
SOON FOR OLIVER TO MEET
SOMEONE YOU'RE DATING.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.846
AND YOU JUST OVERTURNED
THAT DECISION ALL BY YOURSELF.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
DO YOU REMEMBER AGREEING
TO THAT, LUKE?

15:49.549 --> 15:51.985
Luke:
WHAT I REMEMBER
IS AN ULTIMATUM.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.254
Bess:
SO INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN
AND DISCUSSING THIS WITH ME--

15:54.354 --> 15:56.323
THERE'S NO DISCUSSIONS
WITH YOU.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.658
THERE'S JUST GIVING IN
TO KEEP THE PEACE.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.028
OH, SO YOU JUST GO
ALONG WITH WHATEVER
I SAY TO SHUT ME UP

16:01.128 --> 16:03.796
AND THEN YOU GO DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT NO MATTER HOW MUCH
IT'S GOING TO HURT OLIVER?

16:03.896 --> 16:06.333
LOOK, I KNEW
OLIVER COULD HANDLE IT.
AND I KNEW IF I HAD WAITED

16:06.433 --> 16:08.268
FOR YOU TO SIGN OFF
THINGS WOULD NEVER CHANGE.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.470
Paul:
SO, LUKE, DO YOU FEEL
THAT THERE'S NO WAY

16:10.570 --> 16:12.639
TO DISCUSS THINGS WITH BESS
AND COME TO A COMPROMISE?

16:12.739 --> 16:15.975
DO YOU FEEL THAT SHE NEEDS
TO WIN EVERY ARGUMENT?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.478
THAT'S THE WAY
IT WORKS, YES.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.447
MM-HMM. AND, BESS,
DO YOU FEEL THAT LUKE

16:20.547 --> 16:23.383
PRETENDS TO AGREE BUT THEN
HE JUST DOES WHATEVER WANTS?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.985
YEAH, ONLY THIS TIME
IT'S WORSE

16:26.086 --> 16:28.455
BECAUSE HE'S USING OLIVER
TO COVER FOR HIM.

16:28.555 --> 16:31.091
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK OUR JOB HERE

16:31.191 --> 16:32.392
IS TO FIND A WAY
FOR BOTH OF YOU

16:32.492 --> 16:34.761
TO BE STRAIGHTFORWARD
WITH EACH OTHER

16:34.861 --> 16:37.830
SO THAT OLIVER
FEELS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO

16:37.930 --> 16:40.700
HIDE THINGS
FROM EITHER OF YOU.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.403
IF YOU FIGURE THAT OUT,
YOU'RE WORTH A MILLION TIMES
WHAT WE PAY YOU.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.106
BESS, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO JOIN US?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.409
OKAY THEN.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.345
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
BOTH A QUESTION.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.414
WHEN I WAS TALKING
TO OLIVER JUST NOW

16:54.514 --> 16:57.984
HE TOLD ME THAT YOU'D BEEN
PLANNING TO ADOPT A BABY.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.386
IS THAT TRUE?

16:59.486 --> 17:02.289
HE TALKED ABOUT THAT
WITH YOU?

17:02.389 --> 17:05.858
WELL, I WAS SURPRISED
NEITHER OF YOU MENTIONED
IT BEFORE.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.761
THAT'S BECAUSE
IT WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.397
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.699
HE LIKES TO REWRITE
HISTORY HERE.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.967
THE TRUTH IS WE HAD
BEEN TALKING ABOUT HAVING
ANOTHER BABY FOR YEARS.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.604
SHE ACTUALLY THINKS
THAT WAS GOING TO SOLVE
ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

17:17.704 --> 17:21.241
OR MAYBE I WANTED
TO GIVE OLIVER THE CHANCE
TO BE A BIG BROTHER.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.276
YOU KNOW, WE HAD
A REALLY GOOD LIFE

17:23.376 --> 17:26.979
AND I WANTED TO SHARE
THAT WITH ANOTHER CHILD.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.981
I HAD WANTED TO ADOPT
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.318
THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS
WHO NEED A GOOD HOME.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.521
AND, YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T FEEL ALL THE NEED

17:34.621 --> 17:36.923
TO GO THROUGH PREGNANCY
AND LABOR ALL OVER AGAIN.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.759
ALSO YOU GENERALLY
NEED TO BE HAVING SEX
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.195
Paul:
CAN WE GO BACK TO
THE ADOPTION FOR A MOMENT?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.931
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:45.031 --> 17:48.835
I HONESTLY BELIEVED
THAT LUKE WANTED THIS

17:48.935 --> 17:50.837
AT LEAST AS MUCH AS I DID.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.273
WE WERE FIGHTING ALL THE TIME.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE HER HAPPY.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.776
WELL, CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE ADOPTION PROCESS?

17:56.876 --> 17:58.311
WHAT THAT WAS LIKE
FOR YOU?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.413
Bess:
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS,

18:00.513 --> 18:02.849
I WAS THE ONE
WHO DID ALL THE WORK.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.085
SHE'D GO CRAZY ON ME
BECAUSE I FILLED OUT
MY MEDICAL REPORT WRONG.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.520
I HAD SPENT A WEEK
ON THAT THING,

18:07.620 --> 18:09.356
THEN I HAD TO DO IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.891
THE WEEK BEFORE THE SOCIAL
WORKER CAME FOR THE HOME VISIT,

18:11.991 --> 18:13.460
SHE GOES NUTS.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.695
SHE'D REHEARSE WITH
OLIVER EVERY NIGHT.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.397
TELLS HIM WHAT TO SAY.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.566
SHE'S TERRIFIED THAT
WE'RE GONNA BE TURNED DOWN.

18:19.666 --> 18:23.570
BUT OF COURSE, WE PASS
WITH FLYING COLORS.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.439
SO WHEN WE GOT
THE REFERRAL,

18:26.539 --> 18:30.143
THE BABY'S MEDICAL RECORDS,
HIS LITTLE PHOTO...

18:31.478 --> 18:34.914
I SHOWED IT TO OLIVER.
WE WERE SO EXCITED.

18:35.014 --> 18:38.117
I WAS READY THAT NIGHT
TO GET ON A PLANE TO
PICK UP THE BABY.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.788
AND THEN I GAVE THE FOLDER
TO LUKE TO LOOK AT.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.429
I TOOK ONE LOOK
AT THAT KID'S FACE

18:49.529 --> 18:52.565
AND I KNEW WHAT A DISASTER
ALL THIS WAS GOING TO BE.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.369
THE WHOLE THING WAS
JUST A BAND-AID.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.839
AND THEN NOW WE'RE GONNA
FLY TO AFRICA

18:59.939 --> 19:01.608
AND HAVE SOME POOR BABY

19:01.708 --> 19:04.744
DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE
OF OUR UNHAPPINESS?

19:04.844 --> 19:08.047
NO NO, I KNEW THE KID
WOULD FIND A BETTER HOME.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.583
WE WERE ALREADY
OUT 20 GRAND,

19:10.683 --> 19:13.486
BUT I FIGURED
THAT'S THE PRICE YOU PAY.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.423
THERE WAS NO WAY
WE WERE GONNA FIX THIS.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.726
HE COMES INTO OUR ROOM,

19:19.826 --> 19:22.629
THROWS THE FOLDER ON THE BED
AND SAYS, "I'M LEAVING."

19:22.729 --> 19:26.299
SO WOULD YOU SAY THEN
THAT THIS ADOPTION

19:26.399 --> 19:29.135
WAS THE FINAL STRAW
IN YOUR MARRIAGE?

19:29.236 --> 19:31.338
WELL, HE JUST DECIDED
OUR MARRIAGE WAS OVER

19:31.438 --> 19:32.972
WITHOUT EVEN DISCUSSING
IT WITH ME.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.608
THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH YOU.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.578
IF YOU HAD SAID ANY
OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID TODAY

19:38.678 --> 19:40.913
THAT WOULD HAVE
AT LEAST BEEN SOMETHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:42.982 --> 19:46.052
SO, LUKE,
ONCE AGAIN YOU FELT THAT

19:46.152 --> 19:48.455
BESS WAS PUSHING YOU.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.324
AND, BESS, ONCE AGAIN
YOU FELT LIKE LUKE

19:51.424 --> 19:53.460
DECEIVED YOU.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.229
IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE YOU'VE NEVER

19:56.329 --> 19:58.498
REALLY BEEN ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT

19:58.598 --> 20:01.434
HOW TO WORK THROUGH
YOUR PROBLEMS TOGETHER.
WOULD THAT BE RIGHT?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.636
I WOULD SAY THAT'S
PRETTY ACCURATE.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.938
YEAH, MAYBE THAT'S
THE WHOLE REASON WHY
WE'RE NOT MARRIED ANYMORE.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.807
SEE, THE THING ABOUT IT IS
THAT OLIVER NEEDS YOU

20:07.907 --> 20:10.377
TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE
DECISIONS AS A TEAM.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.613
AND HE NEEDS YOU TO--

20:13.713 --> 20:17.950
HE NEEDS YOU TO EXPLAIN
THINGS TO HIM CLEARLY,

20:18.050 --> 20:20.453
OTHERWISE HE--

20:20.553 --> 20:22.689
HE FILLS IN THE GAPS
ON HIS OWN.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.358
I MEAN, FOR INSTANCE,
DO YOU REALIZE

20:25.458 --> 20:27.594
THAT HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT

20:27.694 --> 20:30.663
HE'S GOING TO HAVE
A BABY BROTHER?

20:35.034 --> 20:36.469
OH NO.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.340
WHAT?
YOU NEVER TOLD HIM?

20:42.642 --> 20:45.412
CAN WE--
CAN WE BRING HIM
IN HERE RIGHT NOW?

20:45.512 --> 20:46.646
CAN WE JUST TALK
ABOUT THIS TOGETHER?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.615
DO YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU CAN BOTH

20:48.715 --> 20:51.083
TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT
IN A WAY THAT WILL

20:51.183 --> 20:53.886
CLEAR UP HIS CONFUSION?

20:56.222 --> 20:58.625
I GUESS WE OWE IT TO HIM
TO TRY, RIGHT?

20:59.792 --> 21:01.628
OKAY.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.196
OKAY, I'LL--

21:04.297 --> 21:06.366
I'LL CALL HIM IN THEN.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.036
( theme music playing )
