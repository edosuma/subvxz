01:38.374 --> 01:41.468
Come on!

01:44.513 --> 01:47.141
Come on!

01:50.519 --> 01:52.714
It's a green light!

01:58.394 --> 01:59.793
Come on! Move it!

01:59.996 --> 02:02.726
Sir? Open your window, sir.
Okay! Okay!

02:03.532 --> 02:05.022
Wait a minute!

02:05.234 --> 02:07.668
- Sir? Sir?
- I'm blind.

02:07.870 --> 02:11.499
- Open the window, please!
- I'm blind.

02:11.707 --> 02:14.301
Stay calm. Stay where you are,
and tell me, what happened?

02:14.510 --> 02:16.341
I'm blind! I'm blind!

02:16.545 --> 02:19.946
It's like something's flooding
my eyes. I didn't do anything.

02:20.149 --> 02:21.548
Right. It's probably nerves.

02:21.751 --> 02:22.775
- Should someone call an ambulance?
- Please...

02:22.985 --> 02:25.283
...just take me my apartment.
- Just wait a minute!

02:25.488 --> 02:28.582
- And my wife can help me.
- I can take him.

02:29.058 --> 02:30.923
I can drive him home.

02:31.127 --> 02:32.560
- Are you sure, sir?
- Yes. Of course.

02:32.762 --> 02:34.855
We got to get him off the street.

02:35.064 --> 02:36.258
Okay.

02:36.565 --> 02:38.499
Okay, sir.
I'll take you to the other side.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.061
It's just a blind guy.

02:43.272 --> 02:46.469
Careful. Take care of him.
Watch him. He can't see.

02:51.013 --> 02:52.310
He's blind.

02:52.515 --> 02:56.451
He's blind.

02:56.652 --> 02:57.676
Here you go.
Give me your hand.

02:57.887 --> 03:00.583
Watch your head, please.
Easy. Easy.

03:01.257 --> 03:06.422
Okay. So, you can hear me, right?

03:06.629 --> 03:09.257
- Yeah. Right.
- So say something if you need it.

03:09.465 --> 03:13.731
And we'll have you home in no time.
Okay? Any questions?

03:14.603 --> 03:17.163
Why aren't we moving?

03:19.075 --> 03:21.635
It's a red light.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.888
There's a movement to it.
Like light particles.

03:41.097 --> 03:44.294
Like light shining
through a sea of white.

03:44.500 --> 03:48.163
- It feels like I'm swimming in milk.
- Really? Well...

03:48.370 --> 03:52.272
one good thing is I've never heard
blindness described as white.

03:52.475 --> 03:54.773
It's black, right?
It's the absence of light.

03:54.977 --> 03:57.172
- So, that's a good thing.
- I guess.

03:57.379 --> 03:59.074
Yeah, sure it is.
It means it's not real blindness.

03:59.648 --> 04:01.741
Anyway, it's too fast.
Blindness is slow, right?

04:01.951 --> 04:05.944
What you have is psychosomatic.
Some kind of nervous thing.

04:06.322 --> 04:08.119
Just a second here.
Is this where we're going?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.655
Okay, so... Why don't
you just get out here.

04:13.162 --> 04:17.894
- Walk to the curb.
- All right.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.694
- I got it.
- Walk to your left. Straight at.

04:20.903 --> 04:24.498
Hey! Hey! Look!

04:28.444 --> 04:30.344
Help!

04:35.851 --> 04:37.682
Help!

04:46.162 --> 04:47.493
Help!

04:47.696 --> 04:49.994
Don't worry.
I got you.

04:50.199 --> 04:52.963
- You okay?
- Yeah. Oh, my God!

04:54.904 --> 04:56.201
This your building?
It's nice.

04:56.872 --> 04:58.999
He's blind.
Can't see.

04:59.475 --> 05:03.377
Just put your hand... Be careful!
Remember stairs, right?

05:04.313 --> 05:06.975
What floor? I got it.
I got it.

05:07.283 --> 05:10.343
- 14th.
- So. What are your problems?

05:10.986 --> 05:12.886
- Sorry?
- What are you worried about?

05:13.255 --> 05:16.053
- Nothing unusual.
- No? Any other symptoms?

05:16.258 --> 05:17.555
- No?
- Like nervous symptoms?

05:17.760 --> 05:20.820
No, my life is pretty regular
these days.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.329
Not a care in the world?
Life of leisure, huh?

05:24.567 --> 05:29.527
Here we go. Is anyone going to be at
home, or are you going to be alone?

05:31.740 --> 05:34.106
Honey, I'm home.

05:35.010 --> 05:37.001
Honey, I'm home.

05:39.148 --> 05:41.673
- Thank you for everything.
- Nice place.

05:45.120 --> 05:49.557
Did your wife design it here?

05:50.059 --> 05:55.190
No. Listen. Thank you for
everything. I'm so fine for now.

05:55.397 --> 05:59.265
Do you want me to stay and take care
of you until your wife gets home?

05:59.468 --> 06:02.028
- No, no, no. I'm fine.
- Sure? It would make me feel better.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.671
I'm fine. Thank you.

06:03.873 --> 06:05.340
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

06:05.541 --> 06:07.600
- You want me to stay?
- No, thank you.

06:07.810 --> 06:10.370
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.275
Thank you.

06:20.823 --> 06:27.092
Wonderful!
I liked it so much.

06:27.396 --> 06:29.728
Look at this.

06:30.966 --> 06:34.333
You couldn't have cleaned
it up before you lay down?

06:37.139 --> 06:39.164
Are you even listening?

06:39.975 --> 06:42.705
I'm not your maid.

06:44.980 --> 06:49.280
You're bleeding.
Are you okay?

06:54.223 --> 06:56.282
I'm blind.

07:00.796 --> 07:05.529
Eye doctors, eye doctors...
Do you know any?

07:06.035 --> 07:07.935
Let's just go to the hospital.

07:08.137 --> 07:11.800
No way, they'll keep
us waiting for hours.

07:12.007 --> 07:15.374
We're going to a specialist.

07:15.878 --> 07:17.812
I'd rather die than stay like this.

07:18.013 --> 07:21.244
Shut up!
You're confusing me.

07:21.684 --> 07:23.618
My apologies.

07:25.788 --> 07:26.982
- Honey?
- What?

07:27.189 --> 07:30.090
- So?
- So, what?

07:30.292 --> 07:31.953
Can you see anything?
Anything at all?

07:32.161 --> 07:34.493
- I see nothing.
- Try harder.

07:34.697 --> 07:36.892
- What?
- Where are the car keys?

07:37.733 --> 07:40.861
Take your keys.
You can look for mine later.

07:41.070 --> 07:42.765
Taxi!

07:48.544 --> 07:50.239
Are you sure you
looked everywhere?

07:50.446 --> 07:54.712
Sure. There's nothing
wrong with my eyes.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.920
What kind of a person
steals from a blind man?

08:01.190 --> 08:03.954
He should go blind.

08:09.431 --> 08:11.331
You can come with me now, sir.
The doctor will see you in a minute.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.522
- Excuse me.
- Oh, God!

08:12.735 --> 08:15.033
But I've been waiting here
for over an hour with a child.

08:15.237 --> 08:16.431
Sorry, doctor's orders.

08:16.638 --> 08:18.435
Yeah, but my appointment was at six.
It's now seven o'clock.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.074
- We'll get to you as soon as we can.
- And it's not...

08:21.410 --> 08:25.346
Miss. Miss... Let him go.
He's worse off than we are.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.974
This is totally disrespectable.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.614
Nothing. Nothing in your lenses.
Nothing in the retina.

08:35.457 --> 08:36.788
Somebody just turned
out the lights?

08:36.991 --> 08:40.325
No, it's more like all the
lights were turned on.

08:41.196 --> 08:43.027
Your eyes look perfect.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.597
You see, I told you.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.563
Except I cannot see anything.

08:46.769 --> 08:49.567
Yes, and if this is true then we're
going to run some more tests.

08:49.772 --> 08:51.967
Unfortunately we're not going
to be able to do that today.

08:52.908 --> 08:54.603
What do you mean, if it's true?

08:54.810 --> 08:56.937
- You think I'm lying?
- No, not at all.

08:57.379 --> 09:00.780
But I've to be honest. I've never
experienced anything like this.

09:01.216 --> 09:03.707
So, is that a prescription?

09:03.952 --> 09:06.944
No, I'm actually writing
directions for the hospital.

09:08.590 --> 09:11.388
I know how to get to the hospital.
I don't need directions.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.151
They're not for you.
They're for the staff.

09:13.362 --> 09:16.695
So they know what to do with
your husband when he arrives.

09:18.534 --> 09:21.025
- So that's it?
- That's it for now.

09:21.236 --> 09:24.205
It's going to be okay.
We're going to find out what it is.

09:24.506 --> 09:26.599
There's nothing else
we can do right now.

09:30.212 --> 09:31.839
And I'll just need a
signature right there.

09:32.047 --> 09:34.015
- Okay.
- I'm sorry. Not you, him.

09:34.750 --> 09:36.650
Me?

09:40.122 --> 09:42.682
- Parking stamp?
- We don't have a car.

09:53.435 --> 09:55.164
Shit.

09:59.208 --> 10:03.304
What you doing?
The road's closed!

10:03.712 --> 10:04.701
What was that?

10:10.319 --> 10:11.786
Fuck!

10:17.626 --> 10:20.151
That's stupid.
Stupid.

10:39.314 --> 10:42.681
Alright, we're gonna do this guy.
Remember this guy, the crab?

10:43.819 --> 10:48.347
Alright, we're gonna
test this eye first.

10:48.657 --> 10:50.852
- Do you prefer this lens or this?
- The other one.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.959
- This one? You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:53.328 --> 10:57.230
All right, put your glasses on.
This is for you.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.001
Show your mom.
Good boy.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.967
I'm going to ask you to take the
drops for at least five days.

11:04.173 --> 11:06.607
And maybe, should I keep
wearing the glasses.

11:06.808 --> 11:09.140
Would you like me to
order you to wear them?

11:13.582 --> 11:19.487
Okay. I order you to wear
your sunglasses.

11:19.955 --> 11:22.924
Unless you're bathing or sleeping.

11:23.392 --> 11:25.223
All right, I'll give
you a try tomorrow.

11:25.427 --> 11:30.797
I just wanted to get your take on
a bizarre case I saw today. Okay.

11:31.733 --> 11:36.033
<i>So, it appeared to be a kind of,
"amaurosis", which is a...</i>

11:44.112 --> 11:47.047
...which is a kind of a...
- Sorry.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.444
Are you done? Sure do you
want to hear this or no?

11:49.651 --> 11:52.085
Except with an "amaurosis"
everything goes dark...

11:52.287 --> 11:54.255
and with him everything was white.

11:54.456 --> 11:57.823
- Well, how do you know what he saw?
- Exactly, I don't know...

11:58.026 --> 12:01.154
what he saw, but I guess I have
to take his word for it, don't I?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.125
It could be something
neurological, like...

12:04.333 --> 12:06.392
something we call "agnosia"...

12:06.602 --> 12:10.094
which is an inability to
recognize familiar objects.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.931
- "Agnosia?"
- That's right.

12:14.142 --> 12:17.839
It's as if a man sees, I don't know,
a fork, he looks at it he says:

12:18.080 --> 12:21.641
"What is this thing? I've never
seen anything like this before. "

12:24.553 --> 12:27.579
Is that related to "agnosticism"?

12:29.758 --> 12:31.055
In what way?

12:31.260 --> 12:33.922
You know, "Agnosia", "Agnosticism".

12:34.129 --> 12:37.121
- Etymologically speaking?
- Yeah. Didn't you take Latin?

12:37.332 --> 12:38.924
It's actually Greek, dear.

12:39.134 --> 12:44.128
Well, I bet it has something to do
with ignorance, or lack of belief.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.369
There's a lot of
judgment in that word.

12:48.210 --> 12:50.872
Never mind.
Never mind.

12:51.179 --> 12:52.942
You want some more wine?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.980
- No, but are you sure you do?
- Yeah!

13:14.736 --> 13:17.034
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.199
Wait, hold on, hold on.

13:21.443 --> 13:22.910
What was I gonna ask you?

13:23.111 --> 13:25.773
- What was I gonna say? How are you?
- Something about dinner?

13:25.981 --> 13:27.243
No.

13:27.449 --> 13:31.408
- Diseases?
- No. That's a nice sweater.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.088
Thanks. I can't help you,
sweetheart. Sorry.

13:34.289 --> 13:35.586
- Okay. Good night.
- Good night.

13:35.791 --> 13:39.283
I'm sorry. I'm a little distracted.
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

13:39.494 --> 13:41.052
Could you set the alarm
back for half an hour?

13:41.263 --> 13:42.787
I need to make a couple
calls in the morning.

13:42.998 --> 13:45.523
- Yeah, of course. Good night.
- Good night.

13:45.734 --> 13:48.430
- Thank you for the tart.
- It was Tiramisu.

13:48.637 --> 13:50.764
Yeah, Tiramisu.

14:04.519 --> 14:07.852
Well, well.
What's the big secret?

14:10.625 --> 14:14.493
- What are you hiding from?
- Jerks like you.

14:19.201 --> 14:21.761
That'll be 11 even.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.705
Thank you.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.088
Taxi!

14:45.761 --> 14:48.525
Hi. Hotel Emiliano, please.

14:57.506 --> 14:59.565
Do you have the time?

15:00.308 --> 15:03.106
Yeah, you still have 20 minutes.

15:11.420 --> 15:12.944
<i>- Hi.
- Hi.</i>

15:13.155 --> 15:17.387
<i>Your guy said you might be late.
You're pretty. Nice to meet you.</i>

15:17.592 --> 15:19.958
<i>I can't take my glasses off.
Is that a problem?</i>

15:20.162 --> 15:22.357
<i>- Are you serious?
- Doctor's orders.</i>

15:22.564 --> 15:25.158
<i>- Really?
- I can call another girl.</i>

15:32.874 --> 15:35.035
Fuck!

15:38.547 --> 15:40.572
That was wild.

15:41.216 --> 15:45.277
I mean it. Really weird.

15:45.987 --> 15:48.251
<i>I still see everythingwhite.</i>

16:00.302 --> 16:03.760
- Just ring the bell.
- I've been ringing the bell.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.566
- Can I help you?
- This man says he's your husband.

16:08.810 --> 16:11.210
- He can't see.
- I don't care what he's done!

16:11.413 --> 16:14.075
- You can just turn around...
- Just open the fucking door!

16:14.282 --> 16:15.544
Officer, I don't know this man!

16:15.750 --> 16:18.184
- Forget he's a cop! Let me in!
- All right.

16:18.386 --> 16:20.411
Get out! Fucker!

16:21.223 --> 16:24.886
- Thanks a lot!
- Nice and easy.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.719
Come on, come on, let's go!
I'll get you some help.

16:27.929 --> 16:29.396
- I can't see!
- Wait here! I'll get you some help!

16:29.598 --> 16:32.294
- Just wait right here!
- You don't understand? I can't see!

16:32.501 --> 16:34.560
- Shit!
- Oh, Jesus!

16:34.769 --> 16:36.634
I need security at 18,
right away!

16:36.838 --> 16:41.207
- Hi!
- Hi! What?

16:41.409 --> 16:44.071
- I'm gonna grab your purse.
- Yeah. It's okay.

16:44.279 --> 16:46.474
- Where's your clothes?
- Jesus Christ!

16:46.681 --> 16:48.672
- Everything's going to be all right.
- I know her.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.613
- Don't push me!
- Everything's going to be...

16:50.819 --> 16:54.880
- Shut the hell up!
- Take your hands off me!

16:55.090 --> 16:57.422
- Where's my dress?
- Your dress is just here.

17:02.297 --> 17:05.425
I need to call my parents.

17:43.471 --> 17:46.372
- You're up before the alarm.
- Yes.

17:46.775 --> 17:50.267
- Good morning.
- I doubt it's going to be that good.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.378
What's the matter?

17:53.949 --> 17:56.417
I... I can't see.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.916
- What?
- That patient I saw yesterday...

17:59.120 --> 18:00.644
must have infected me.

18:00.855 --> 18:04.222
That's... that's impossible.
Let... let me look. Here.

18:07.128 --> 18:11.360
I don't... I don't see anything.
Nobody goes blind like that.

18:11.566 --> 18:13.227
Well, there's at least
two of us now.

18:13.435 --> 18:17.132
Oh, no! No, go out! Oh, God, no!
You touched! No, I'm...

18:17.339 --> 18:19.239
- It's infectious!
- No, no, no!

18:19.441 --> 18:21.102
I'm telling you!
It's infectious!

18:21.309 --> 18:23.209
He gave it to me!
It's contagious!

18:23.411 --> 18:27.211
I'm not gonna get sick.
I promise. I promise.

18:27.415 --> 18:28.882
Jesus! I spent the
night in bed with you!

18:29.084 --> 18:34.317
It's all right. We'll take care of it.
It's all right.

18:34.522 --> 18:37.514
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

18:42.998 --> 18:46.229
- What time is it?
- It's almost 8h30.

18:46.434 --> 18:48.732
Okay, let's call the hospital.

18:56.745 --> 18:59.646
<i>With no visible signs of trauma.
No extenuating symptoms.</i>

18:59.848 --> 19:02.282
<i>- I'm not barricade the streets.
- There you go. Here you are.</i>

19:02.484 --> 19:05.612
All right, I'll see you soon.
No problem.

19:06.221 --> 19:08.689
That's a risk I can take.
All right.

19:11.326 --> 19:13.385
- What seems to be the problem?
- It's a boy, he's blind.

19:13.595 --> 19:15.654
Hey, sport! It's okay.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.628
Everything is fine.
Don't be nervous.

19:21.236 --> 19:24.330
<i>Somebody, help!</i>

19:27.208 --> 19:28.869
I can't see!

19:29.611 --> 19:32.580
Ministry of Health.
It's a little bit early.

19:32.781 --> 19:36.239
I would suggest that you call
sometime after nine. Yes nine.

19:36.885 --> 19:40.252
Morning, Minister.
Some strange calls this morning.

19:40.655 --> 19:41.986
Thank you.

19:42.390 --> 19:46.383
God! He was here at six I think.
Or, six thirty.

19:46.761 --> 19:49.321
Who else was here? The waiting
room was crowded, I remember.

19:49.964 --> 19:51.795
- Ma'am.
- Excuse me.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.525
I've all the contact numbers here.
Do you want me to...

19:54.736 --> 19:56.761
Ma'am. I'm gonna have to
ask you to close up shop...

19:56.971 --> 19:59.030
and come with us as
quickly as possible.

19:59.340 --> 20:01.433
May I have those files, please?

20:04.212 --> 20:05.907
They're going to be
here any minute.

20:06.114 --> 20:08.878
I know. That's why
I want you to relax.

20:09.184 --> 20:12.381
I'll take care of everything
we may come across.

20:14.355 --> 20:15.344
Okay, I'll be fine.

20:15.557 --> 20:19.789
If I need anything, I'll have them
call you. Or I'll call you myself.

20:21.730 --> 20:24.221
They can't keep us apart
for too long. Can they?

20:29.504 --> 20:31.096
- Are you coming?
- I'm right behind you.

20:31.306 --> 20:34.605
- Don't lock yourself out now.
- Don't worry, I've got the keys.

20:34.843 --> 20:37.368
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

20:39.114 --> 20:40.604
Please, approach the vehicle.

20:40.815 --> 20:43.784
- Do you have a cell phone, sir?
- Yes.

20:44.052 --> 20:46.020
Put it in the bag, please.

20:46.221 --> 20:48.416
- What for?
- Thank you. This way.

20:48.623 --> 20:51.592
- I got it, thank you.
- This way.

20:53.194 --> 20:55.662
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.623
No, no, step down, ma'am.
I'm asking you to step down!

20:59.834 --> 21:01.563
- No, I'm gonna go.
- My orders are only to take the man.

21:01.770 --> 21:03.897
This vehicle is for infected, okay?

21:04.105 --> 21:08.804
Well, then you'll have to take me,
because I've just gone blind.

21:09.010 --> 21:10.944
Fine, have it your way.

21:13.348 --> 21:14.372
Jesus!

21:25.794 --> 21:28.262
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

21:28.530 --> 21:32.523
<i>The Government regrets having been
forced to exercise with urgency...</i>

21:32.734 --> 21:37.671
<i>what it considers to be it's duty to
protect the population by all means.</i>

21:38.339 --> 21:42.366
<i>We are in a state of crisis.
An epidemic of blindness...</i>

21:42.577 --> 21:46.877
<i>provisionally known as the
"White Sickness"we're relying...</i>

21:47.081 --> 21:50.107
<i>on the public spirit and
cooperation of all citizens...</i>

21:50.318 --> 21:52.809
<i>to stem any future contagion.</i>

21:53.021 --> 21:56.149
<i>The decision to temporarily
quarantine all those infected...</i>

21:56.357 --> 21:59.349
<i>was not taken without
careful consideration.</i>

22:00.161 --> 22:03.324
<i>Be assured that the isolation
in which you find yourselves...</i>

22:03.531 --> 22:07.228
<i>represents, above any
personal considerations...</i>

22:07.435 --> 22:10.427
<i>an act of solidarity with
the rest of the Nation.</i>

22:10.638 --> 22:13.232
You'll never believe
where they brought us.

22:14.108 --> 22:17.771
Let me guess, this guy's voice
is already driving me crazy.

22:19.214 --> 22:21.148
You're lucky you can't see it.

22:21.349 --> 22:24.648
It's a video?
Well, that's scary.

22:24.853 --> 22:26.548
Makes you question what
kind of an idiot...

22:26.754 --> 22:29.780
would play a video in a
quarantine for the blind.

22:30.558 --> 22:32.355
<i>Each ward is equipped with
a phone forcommunication...</i>

22:32.560 --> 22:35.552
<i>- Here.
... with the outside.</i>

22:35.997 --> 22:39.694
<i>The phone is for
emergency purposes only.</i>

22:40.101 --> 22:44.128
We've got to get you out of here.
I'm gonna tell them you can see.

22:44.339 --> 22:46.432
No. They'll never believe it. You'd
never get near enough to tell them.

22:46.641 --> 22:48.541
I want you to go home.
Please, go home.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.870
I know you think you
have to say that, but I'm fine!

22:51.079 --> 22:52.910
- It's what I want.
- Really? All right.

22:53.114 --> 22:55.082
- I want it.
- All right.

22:56.251 --> 22:58.515
Anyway, it's too late now.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.784
- We shouldn't tell that I can see.
- You're right.

23:02.991 --> 23:05.255
<i>With that spirit of
cooperation in mind...</i>

23:05.593 --> 23:09.085
<i>we ask everyone pay attention to
the following simple instructions.</i>

23:09.297 --> 23:11.561
- Are you with me?
- Echo!

23:11.766 --> 23:16.635
<i>Number One: Each patient
shall choose his own bed.</i>

23:17.005 --> 23:19.473
<i>- It's a corridor.
- Number Two:</i>

23:20.041 --> 23:23.841
<i>Each ward shall elect a captain,
or"ward representative"...</i>

23:24.545 --> 23:27.070
<i>forcommunication with
the outside world...</i>

23:27.282 --> 23:29.978
Four? Three?

23:30.251 --> 23:32.617
Row two, Number Three.

23:33.521 --> 23:34.510
Five.

23:34.722 --> 23:37.213
- Doctor, how many wards are there?
- Yes, sorry.

23:37.425 --> 23:40.861
There's two other wards
on this floor...

23:41.062 --> 23:42.654
and then another ward
on the lower floor...

23:42.864 --> 23:46.459
...for people who...
- How do you know that?

23:46.668 --> 23:48.829
We explored a little
before you came in.

23:49.037 --> 23:51.631
We chose this ward because
it's closest to the entrance...

23:51.839 --> 23:54.706
...where the food comes in.
- Well, someone's thinking.

23:54.909 --> 23:58.310
That's the asshole who's
responsible for all this.

23:58.513 --> 23:59.946
If I had my fucking eyes,
I'd kill him.

24:00.415 --> 24:02.007
He's responsible for
stealing my car.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.908
- What? Are you serious?
- Damn yeah!

24:05.119 --> 24:06.484
If I hadn't been decent
and stopped to help you...

24:06.688 --> 24:08.485
I'm gonna go to another room...

24:08.690 --> 24:11.022
as far away as possible
from this son of a bitch.

24:11.225 --> 24:13.887
Son of a bitch who can
steal from a blind man...

24:15.496 --> 24:17.430
- Honey, honey, they're fighting!
- They are fighting?

24:17.632 --> 24:20.100
Stop it now!
Stop that!

24:20.335 --> 24:22.166
- Stop this!
- Over here.

24:22.370 --> 24:24.031
- Stop this!
- Here.

24:24.772 --> 24:28.208
Stop! Stop, you're
acting like children!

24:28.643 --> 24:31.134
Stop it, please!

24:34.515 --> 24:37.609
We're obviously all alone here.
Okay? We're on our own!

24:38.486 --> 24:40.215
So, if you want to make
this place a hell...

24:40.421 --> 24:42.184
you're going upon it in
absolutely the right way.

24:42.390 --> 24:44.187
- He stole my car.
- It doesn't matter.

24:44.392 --> 24:46.417
What are you gonna do with a car?
You can't drive anyway.

24:46.627 --> 24:48.822
- He stole my sight!
- Okay, stop that now.

24:49.030 --> 24:51.999
Look, Doc, or whoever
the fuck you are!

24:52.200 --> 24:55.260
We're all equal here, right?
There's been no proper election.

24:55.470 --> 24:58.337
So don't start ordering people
around with that tone of voice.

24:58.539 --> 25:01.736
I am not ordering anybody,
I'm simply asking you to...

25:01.943 --> 25:04.571
I'm simply asking you
to leave this man alone.

25:04.779 --> 25:06.610
Okay. Fine.

25:06.881 --> 25:10.681
Just be aware that I don't
respond well to that voice...

25:11.219 --> 25:12.743
of authority.

25:12.954 --> 25:16.617
What I do respond to,
in case you're wondering...

25:16.824 --> 25:20.453
is flattery, and people
sucking up to me.

25:20.862 --> 25:25.697
Everyone close your eyes, ladies.
I'm gonna take off my clothes now...

25:26.067 --> 25:29.969
and try out this bed here.
Number Three.

25:32.940 --> 25:37.240
Are you okay? If you need anything
in the night, I'm right here.

25:37.478 --> 25:39.309
I gotta go pee.

25:40.114 --> 25:43.845
Doorway.
So try to remember the route.

25:44.052 --> 25:46.612
How many doors.
How many steps.

25:46.821 --> 25:49.221
I counted them when
I first got here.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.982
- And straight.
- And straight.

25:51.192 --> 25:53.353
Stop it.

25:53.561 --> 25:56.394
Doorway. Doorway.
Right turn.

25:56.597 --> 25:59.395
- I think.
- Right turn.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.329
Straight.

26:02.637 --> 26:05.367
Another doorway.

26:07.475 --> 26:10.501
- Jesus!
- What happened?

26:11.145 --> 26:12.942
What are you wearing
for shoes, bitch?

26:13.147 --> 26:14.739
Where's the wound?

26:14.949 --> 26:16.974
- Here?
- Fuck!

26:17.185 --> 26:18.516
- We need to clean it up.
- Crazy bitch stuck her heel in me.

26:18.719 --> 26:20.619
I tripped.
And watch your mouth.

26:20.822 --> 26:23.154
- I gotta go pee!
- Just hold it a little while.

26:23.357 --> 26:27.054
Everyone, stay put.
We'll be right back. Okay, okay.

26:30.331 --> 26:33.300
I really gotta go pee!

26:43.444 --> 26:46.504
Jesus! A piece of skin,
or something.

26:46.714 --> 26:49.148
I found some dishtowels,
but I don't know if they're clean.

26:49.350 --> 26:51.910
Okay. Keep pressure on it.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.179
- It's too dirty, I think.
- It's really bleeding.

26:54.388 --> 26:58.950
What are you wearing?
Give me your shirt. Quickly.

27:00.428 --> 27:03.693
Thank God we have a real
doctor here. Seriously.

27:04.599 --> 27:06.863
- I was only fooling around.
- Relax, relax.

27:07.401 --> 27:10.700
- Here, here. Let me...
- Careful!

27:10.905 --> 27:13.339
Let me do it.
Let me do it.

27:18.980 --> 27:21.414
Careful with that.
It's expensive.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.409
Expensive shirt of mine.

27:24.785 --> 27:26.150
Once...

27:27.922 --> 27:29.355
twice...

27:29.557 --> 27:31.491
three times.
All right.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.060
- That's fine.
- That's good.

27:45.373 --> 27:48.672
I'm afraid it's gonna be infected.

27:51.312 --> 27:55.942
Doesn't surprise me. The filth
from the street on that shoe.

28:04.392 --> 28:06.690
What time is it?

28:07.094 --> 28:09.358
1h30.

28:17.872 --> 28:21.330
You can't be responsible for everyone.

28:21.542 --> 28:24.272
You need to sleep.

28:30.451 --> 28:35.718
- Are you afraid to close your eyes?
- No. I'm afraid to open them.

28:35.990 --> 28:39.585
Afraid I'll go blind in my sleep.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.135
I'm gonna take a walk.

28:58.779 --> 29:02.442
Opening the gate.
Pull right up to the door.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.255
Closing the gate.

29:11.692 --> 29:13.353
Locking up.

29:14.295 --> 29:16.786
<i>Only the infected are
permitted within these doors.</i>

29:16.998 --> 29:21.935
<i>Once inside, follow the corridor
until the wards. Alright, let's go.</i>

29:23.070 --> 29:25.766
Four, three, two, one.

29:27.608 --> 29:32.807
Five, four, three, two, one.

29:35.483 --> 29:39.112
Five, four, three, two, one.

29:39.553 --> 29:45.287
Hello? Hello, can anyone
hear us? Door. Door?

29:45.826 --> 29:48.727
Hello? Hello?

29:48.929 --> 29:50.123
Honey, wake up.

29:50.331 --> 29:51.821
- What?
- New people.

29:52.033 --> 29:53.091
- How many?
- Not... not many.

29:53.301 --> 29:55.394
- Do you have beds available in here?
- Yeah. We should.

29:55.603 --> 29:58.333
- How many of you are there?
- We don't know.

29:58.572 --> 30:00.597
- We don't know
- Okay.

30:00.808 --> 30:05.302
Maybe you could count off. One by
one, and introduce yourselves.

30:06.747 --> 30:08.180
I'm Number One.
I'm a police officer.

30:08.382 --> 30:12.512
I'm Number Two.
I'm a taxi driver.

30:14.288 --> 30:16.552
Number Three.
A pharmacist assistant.

30:16.757 --> 30:19.225
Four.
I'm a hotel maid.

30:20.194 --> 30:23.652
Five.
Financial advisor.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.992
That's my wife!
That's my wife!

30:28.069 --> 30:29.934
- Honey?
- It's me.

30:30.137 --> 30:31.365
Honey?

30:31.572 --> 30:34.564
- Where are you?
- Here.

30:35.376 --> 30:37.367
Where are you?

30:37.578 --> 30:40.342
Here.
Say something.

30:42.983 --> 30:46.043
Here.

30:47.888 --> 30:54.020
- Keep talking.
- Here.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.314
That's great!

31:16.617 --> 31:21.554
- Is my mom here?
- She'll be here, don't worry. Okay?

31:21.756 --> 31:23.553
Get off!

31:24.392 --> 31:27.293
That's them. I wanna catch them.
Quickly.

31:29.463 --> 31:34.298
- It's occupied. Move on.
- We'll be right back!

31:34.502 --> 31:38.598
- And who was that guy talking?
- Is our ward representative, right?

31:38.806 --> 31:40.535
Please!

31:40.908 --> 31:42.967
- Let's go!
- Please! Stop!

31:43.177 --> 31:44.166
- Stop!
- Stop!

31:44.378 --> 31:47.142
- Please wait!
- Excuse me!

31:47.348 --> 31:48.872
- Wait!
- Wait!

31:49.083 --> 31:52.314
- I'm sorry. You gotta to get back.
- Excuse me. Listen.

31:52.586 --> 31:54.611
We have a man here
with a injured leg...

31:54.822 --> 31:57.052
and he needs serious
medical attention.

31:57.258 --> 32:00.159
He has an infection, he needs
antibiotics, I'm a doctor.

32:00.361 --> 32:02.420
I can't let you leave.
So, please, turn back.

32:02.630 --> 32:05.724
Okay. I'm not asking to leave. I'm
simply trying to ask for help here.

32:05.933 --> 32:08.663
Get the fuck back!
Another step and I'm gonna shoot.

32:08.869 --> 32:10.530
- Honey...
- This is ridiculous.

32:10.738 --> 32:13.502
- I have a sick man here.
- This isn't gonna work.

32:13.707 --> 32:16.767
I'm gonna count to three and
if you don't turn back...

32:16.977 --> 32:18.501
I'm going to shoot you!

32:23.851 --> 32:26.877
Can you talk to your superior,
please?

32:27.087 --> 32:29.146
- One!
- You got to be kidding me.

32:29.356 --> 32:31.415
- Two!
- This is... this is insanity!

32:31.625 --> 32:33.616
Will you talk to your supervisors?

32:33.828 --> 32:36.058
- This is not going to work!
- Three! I'm gonna fucking shoot you!

32:36.430 --> 32:38.796
Let's go!

32:41.936 --> 32:46.873
- This is ridiculous!
- Just forget it. They're not...

32:49.477 --> 32:51.411
I can't believe this is happening.

32:53.781 --> 32:55.009
Stop.

32:55.216 --> 32:57.184
<i>Each ward is equipped
with a phone...</i>

32:57.384 --> 32:59.147
<i>forcommunication
with the outside...</i>

32:59.353 --> 33:02.049
<i>the phone is for
emergency purposes only.</i>

33:10.764 --> 33:13.927
Take. Try it.

33:14.235 --> 33:15.600
- This is great.
- Is there any coffee here?

33:15.803 --> 33:18.704
Is there any extra food
at the end there?

33:20.774 --> 33:22.401
I don't have.

33:22.610 --> 33:24.840
I don't...
The other table needs more.

33:25.045 --> 33:28.242
I think I have one extra fruit cup.

33:28.649 --> 33:31.812
- Any want the meat pack?
- The other table can have some?

33:32.019 --> 33:34.078
Does anybody have a knife?

33:34.421 --> 33:37.515
- A knife?
- Or a fork?

33:37.992 --> 33:40.517
I have a knife.

33:40.728 --> 33:43.754
- Do you want to borrow mine?
- I'll wait, what about you?

33:43.964 --> 33:47.024
- We can share.
- No problem.

33:47.501 --> 33:50.470
I'm still curious about what
happened to that girl, though.

33:50.671 --> 33:52.969
There was this girl, in 1806.

33:53.574 --> 33:57.237
Screaming. Naked,
except for these sunglasses.

33:57.444 --> 33:59.378
- Naked?
- She'd gone blind?

33:59.580 --> 34:02.378
Yeah. She was the one
that infected me.

34:03.150 --> 34:04.447
- Is it good your fruit?
- Yeah.

34:05.119 --> 34:07.451
Yes, I'll leave a message.

34:07.655 --> 34:10.418
My message is: Why is there
an emergency number...

34:10.623 --> 34:13.058
if there's no one
there to answer it?

34:13.793 --> 34:15.625
We have a situation
here in the blind ward.

34:15.963 --> 34:18.898
Apparently you missed that,
because we don't have enough food.

34:19.132 --> 34:24.435
Also, there's still my request from
yesterday for an medical supply kit.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.938
I hope you get this
message before dinner.

34:29.376 --> 34:31.400
Six more coming!

34:33.414 --> 34:35.905
Number Five:
Security guard at a hotel.

34:36.116 --> 34:37.639
Number Six: Engineer.

34:37.851 --> 34:39.580
I'm a receptionist at
an ophthalmologist.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.444
I know your voice.

34:41.655 --> 34:44.715
- Oh, my God, where are you?
- Here. Here.

34:44.925 --> 34:47.792
I'm 7, I forgot to say 7.

34:55.369 --> 34:58.099
Are you all right?
I've got you. All right?

34:58.305 --> 35:04.904
Door. Left, left, make a left.
And straight. Straight.

35:05.546 --> 35:07.138
<i>Keep going.</i>

35:07.348 --> 35:10.840
- Do you need a hand?
- No. I got it. That's it.

35:23.864 --> 35:26.424
<i>First of all,
welcome to the newcomers.</i>

35:27.568 --> 35:29.729
We're Ward One.

35:32.139 --> 35:33.868
There's a few things
I want to discuss.

35:34.074 --> 35:37.441
We've a guide line that connects
all the wards to each other.

35:37.645 --> 35:39.977
It's an innovation made by my wife.

35:40.180 --> 35:42.239
We can thank her for that.

35:43.050 --> 35:47.783
<i>There's another point. The toilets.
They're absolutely disgusting.</i>

35:47.988 --> 35:51.651
<i>I'm going to need a team to go
and see what's going on in there.</i>

36:04.672 --> 36:07.698
I like the warm feeling on my face.

36:08.942 --> 36:11.274
The smell too.

36:12.079 --> 36:14.673
You used to like it...

36:17.051 --> 36:21.818
Remember that New Year's
when we went to the Shrine?

36:24.391 --> 36:29.829
There were so many people
waiting in line.

36:30.364 --> 36:33.993
It was cold.

36:34.201 --> 36:37.898
The ceremonial fire
was near the line.

36:38.105 --> 36:40.573
When we got close to it...

36:40.774 --> 36:44.301
our bodies were
warmed on one side...

36:44.511 --> 36:48.242
It felt good!

36:49.516 --> 36:52.610
We didn't even know
each other that well.

37:01.862 --> 37:03.796
And so...

37:03.997 --> 37:06.363
I don't want to listen.

37:12.506 --> 37:14.804
I don't want to listen.

37:16.210 --> 37:18.337
Why?

37:21.415 --> 37:24.942
I can't pretend.

37:34.228 --> 37:36.856
There's no...
there's no soap.

37:37.064 --> 37:40.227
I guess it's better than nothing.

37:42.269 --> 37:44.567
- You hear that?
- What?

37:46.573 --> 37:49.007
- Any bed in here?
- There's not.

37:52.579 --> 37:54.479
Hello.

37:54.715 --> 37:56.842
Hello.

37:57.284 --> 38:00.378
Would you happen to have
an extra bed in your dorm?

38:00.587 --> 38:02.782
I have a radio.

38:08.362 --> 38:11.456
There's not as many
stations as there used to be.

38:11.665 --> 38:16.432
But I guess, if you insist...
I can give you an update.

38:16.637 --> 38:19.970
- At least we save on the batteries.
- Please.

38:20.174 --> 38:22.665
In the first 24 hours there
were hundreds of cases...

38:22.876 --> 38:24.343
or so, the rumor says.

38:24.545 --> 38:29.312
All the same. No pain.
A sea of white.

38:31.718 --> 38:34.881
<i>The Government's response,
as you know, was decisive.</i>

38:35.088 --> 38:38.421
<i>The first of the
make shift quarantines.</i>

38:38.692 --> 38:43.026
<i>But this decommissioned sanitarium
didn't make ideal public relations.</i>

38:43.230 --> 38:45.824
Let's organize a massive
international medical conference...

38:46.033 --> 38:47.830
of ophthalmologists
and neurologists.

38:48.035 --> 38:49.366
We don't yet know if this is...

38:49.570 --> 38:52.300
<i>And so for days and days...</i>

38:52.506 --> 38:55.737
<i>the helpless viewing public
was subjected to seminars...</i>

38:55.943 --> 38:57.410
<i>and endless roundtables...</i>

38:57.611 --> 38:59.238
<i>with specialists
from around the world...</i>

38:59.446 --> 39:01.471
<i>proclaiming their general ignorance.</i>

39:01.682 --> 39:04.446
...that was published in "Infectious
Disease International"...

39:04.651 --> 39:07.085
<i>How premature it was
to talk of cures.</i>

39:07.287 --> 39:10.779
<i>How more research was needed,
and more funding.</i>

39:10.991 --> 39:14.358
<i>A point that was at least
once dramatically illustrated.</i>

39:14.828 --> 39:17.524
Oh, my God!
I've gone blind! Oh, my God!

39:17.731 --> 39:20.666
Help me! Help me!
Help me! Someone, please!

39:21.468 --> 39:22.765
Somebody!

39:23.136 --> 39:27.732
- Shit! Shit! No, no, no!
- Take him out of here!

39:27.941 --> 39:31.502
<i>Weeks passed, and with time,
and the constant coverage...</i>

39:31.712 --> 39:33.976
<i>the city was bored back to work.</i>

39:34.181 --> 39:36.672
<i>Oblivious to the evidence
all around them...</i>

39:36.884 --> 39:38.977
<i>that the disease was
immune to bureaucracy.</i>

39:39.186 --> 39:42.713
- No! No!
- Ma'am, stop. Stop struggle, please.

39:42.923 --> 39:45.483
What about the roads and traffic?

39:46.560 --> 39:48.391
Chaos, as usual.

39:48.595 --> 39:53.055
But then reports came of a
bus crash with 23 casualties.

39:56.503 --> 39:59.472
That same day, two planes collided.

39:59.673 --> 40:03.700
<i>No one could say if the disease
was the cause of the accidents.</i>

40:03.911 --> 40:05.469
<i>But people were terrified.</i>

40:05.679 --> 40:08.739
<i>And eitherthe panic
spread the blindness.</i>

40:11.151 --> 40:13.051
<i>Orthe blindness spread the panic.</i>

40:13.253 --> 40:14.777
<i>Casualties multiplied.</i>

40:14.988 --> 40:17.183
<i>People decided to stay home.</i>

40:17.591 --> 40:20.617
<i>And the traffic
problems were solved.</i>

40:23.964 --> 40:28.060
<i>My fellow citizens,
friends, supporters.</i>

40:28.268 --> 40:31.635
Like so many of you,
I have gone blind.

40:45.419 --> 40:49.480
Maybe... maybe we need
some music after all.

40:51.558 --> 40:53.526
Leave it there.

41:28.829 --> 41:30.956
<i>And forthe length of the song...</i>

41:31.164 --> 41:37.330
<i>the "Kingdom of the Blind"shrank
to the circle of an AM radio.</i>

41:49.649 --> 41:52.379
<i>One can only imagine
the inclined heads...</i>

41:52.586 --> 41:55.578
<i>the wide eyes, the tears.</i>

41:55.789 --> 41:59.850
<i>Why do they ask were they
tears of joy or sorrow?</i>

42:10.837 --> 42:14.204
<i>Joy and sorrow are not
like oil and water.</i>

42:15.442 --> 42:17.842
<i>They coexist.</i>

42:24.084 --> 42:27.952
Ladies and gentleman,
I need you to follow my voice.

42:29.122 --> 42:33.149
Come towards my voice, and as
you do, please, watch your step.

42:33.360 --> 42:36.557
- Right ahead.
- Why is I warned you?

42:36.763 --> 42:39.630
For follow some one.

42:42.736 --> 42:45.500
- Do not push!
- Put it to the right.

42:51.511 --> 42:58.110
<i>Number 12: Anyone attempting leave
the premises will be corrected.</i>

43:03.390 --> 43:07.554
Hello? Excuse me! Sir?

43:09.729 --> 43:13.187
Can we have some guidance,
please? Sir?

43:15.836 --> 43:17.599
- Stay in line.
- Please?

43:18.438 --> 43:22.966
- Stay in line, little man.
- Hello? Excuse me, sir?

43:23.276 --> 43:25.141
Some one?

43:26.179 --> 43:28.943
- We need some guidance, please.
- Stay in line.

43:31.384 --> 43:32.817
Fuck!

43:56.076 --> 44:01.309
Attention. The shovel you requested
is waiting in the yard.

44:03.583 --> 44:06.552
Choose one person to
come and collect it.

44:06.786 --> 44:09.050
One person.

44:14.327 --> 44:16.295
Where is it?

44:16.563 --> 44:20.556
Straight ahead. Just come.
Come this way.

44:21.134 --> 44:23.193
Okay. Good.
You're fine.

44:23.403 --> 44:25.564
Next one's the ground.
That's okay.

44:25.772 --> 44:31.233
Okay, keep coming. Warmer. Warmer.
Keep coming.

44:31.811 --> 44:35.144
Oh, colder. Stop.

44:35.749 --> 44:39.617
Okay.
Turn to your right.

44:40.420 --> 44:43.651
Good.
Now, keep going forward.

44:43.857 --> 44:48.590
Okay. Warmer.
Warmer, colder. Stop.

44:48.795 --> 44:51.628
Now, turn right again.

44:51.965 --> 44:54.627
Yeah. That's it.
Okay. Good.

44:54.834 --> 44:57.826
<i>Very good.
Now keep going forward.</i>

44:58.038 --> 45:00.336
Go forward.

45:00.540 --> 45:05.705
Good, warmer, colder, colder.
Stop, stop, stop.

45:05.912 --> 45:10.178
Colder! Colder!

45:11.184 --> 45:14.847
Did you see that, Sarge?
Did you see that?

45:15.589 --> 45:17.056
The blind adapt quickly.

45:18.825 --> 45:25.492
<i>Ward Three? Today, three newcomers
were gunned down by the guards.</i>

45:25.865 --> 45:28.766
<i>So, I think that the
best solution would be that...</i>

45:28.969 --> 45:32.871
<i>each ward, takes one body,
takes turns with the shovel...</i>

45:33.073 --> 45:37.100
<i>...and they bury theirown share.
- What do you mean our share?</i>

45:37.310 --> 45:39.301
<i>They're not ours.</i>

45:39.813 --> 45:43.010
Yes, but some of them would
have probably come to this ward.

45:43.316 --> 45:47.343
After they were turned away
from yours... like I was.

45:48.121 --> 45:50.954
Our ward is full.

45:51.691 --> 45:53.784
The same here.

45:54.694 --> 45:57.686
Okay, so we're all in
the same position, right?

45:59.366 --> 46:00.856
Listen...

46:02.002 --> 46:05.768
I don't wanna argue. I just
wanna have these people buried.

46:05.972 --> 46:08.907
And I think the fair thing to do
is that each ward takes a body.

46:09.109 --> 46:12.704
And then the job is quickly done.
All right?

46:14.781 --> 46:16.612
Good.

46:16.816 --> 46:20.547
Now, there's the matter
of food rationing.

46:21.554 --> 46:25.046
It seems that one of the wards is
taking more than their fair share.

46:25.258 --> 46:28.193
So, I'm proposing that we put
together some sort of committee...

46:28.395 --> 46:30.556
with a representative
from each ward, and...

46:30.764 --> 46:32.391
Who the fuck are you?

46:32.632 --> 46:34.623
Who the fuck are you?

46:36.536 --> 46:38.003
Excuse me?

46:38.938 --> 46:41.736
Yeah! Yeah!
Who do you think you are?

46:42.142 --> 46:43.666
Giving all these orders.

46:43.877 --> 46:47.040
I am. I'm the chosen representative
from Ward One.

46:47.247 --> 46:49.875
And I suggest that you people
choose your own representative.

46:50.083 --> 46:52.051
Otherwise we're gonna be at
each other's throats constantly.

46:52.252 --> 46:54.550
- So you wanna talk to our leader?
- That's right.

46:54.754 --> 46:57.780
Yeah, yeah. Like in a diplomatic
mission, negotiate?

46:58.224 --> 47:02.923
Yeah? Well, here we have
a monarchy system.

47:03.129 --> 47:07.259
And I hereby declare myself
the King of Ward Three.

47:07.467 --> 47:11.369
- Long live the king!
- Long live the king!

47:11.571 --> 47:15.302
- Any objections?
- Long live the king!

47:15.909 --> 47:17.171
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Long live the king!

47:17.377 --> 47:21.746
For my first pronouncement I declare
that everyone in Ward Three...

47:21.948 --> 47:25.884
will eat dinner before we think
about getting, or burying any dead.

47:28.855 --> 47:32.188
So, eat, eat. Come on, eat.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

47:35.195 --> 47:39.291
You can't sleep like that.
You're filthy. Give me your clothes.

47:39.499 --> 47:41.933
I'll wash them tomorrow.

47:49.843 --> 47:51.936
Go to sleep.

48:13.266 --> 48:15.860
How are you?

48:17.036 --> 48:22.702
They don't know what it's like.
You gotta see it to believe it.

48:23.743 --> 48:26.803
If you want something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

48:27.013 --> 48:31.575
Okay. Okay.
Just try to get some sleep.

48:31.785 --> 48:34.015
You're so hot.

48:36.356 --> 48:39.018
- I know you can see.
- No, I can't...

48:39.225 --> 48:42.626
...I don't know why you think that.
- Don't lie to me. You trust me, huh?

48:42.896 --> 48:45.626
You trust me, then why
don't you tell me the truth?

48:46.766 --> 48:49.394
You can't trust a thief, right?

48:50.537 --> 48:54.303
I got a secret too.
You know what? I'm smart.

48:54.841 --> 48:58.709
And when I went blind,
it made me think better.

48:59.345 --> 49:01.643
I got a lot to contribute.

49:06.252 --> 49:09.551
I'm sorry for being such a burden.

49:14.093 --> 49:15.617
Oh, God!

49:20.600 --> 49:23.091
I can't take this.

49:30.977 --> 49:34.504
Come on, lie down.
Get some sleep.

49:38.351 --> 49:40.410
What time is it?

50:02.575 --> 50:05.066
What? What?

50:05.378 --> 50:09.109
What's the matter?
Have you lost your sight?

50:12.118 --> 50:16.248
I forgot to wind my watch.

51:04.470 --> 51:07.837
You fuckers.
Are you in pain?

51:09.876 --> 51:13.141
- Look at me!
- Did you hear that?

51:14.080 --> 51:15.172
I'm gonna check it out.

51:15.381 --> 51:18.782
- Hey, fuckers!
- What the fuck song is that?

51:20.486 --> 51:22.716
- It sucks.
- You suck.

51:22.922 --> 51:25.117
Whatever.

51:46.212 --> 51:48.476
Fuck!

51:50.783 --> 51:52.978
- Did you get him?
- Blood!

51:53.186 --> 51:57.054
There's blood, man, step back!
It could be infected, step back!

51:57.957 --> 52:00.687
The Sarge is gonna
fucking kill me.

52:10.269 --> 52:13.636
- Is this the right way to go?
- Yeah.

52:25.852 --> 52:28.616
You know, he told me he knew
I could see. He told me that...

52:28.821 --> 52:32.382
...and I did nothing. Nothing.
- What could you have possibly did?

52:32.592 --> 52:34.321
- You did everything you could.
- I think I've to tell them, and...

52:34.527 --> 52:35.551
- And then what?
- And maybe...

52:35.762 --> 52:36.888
- Become their slave?
- I could help. I could help.

52:37.096 --> 52:39.462
- It's bad enough as it is.
- I can handle this.

52:39.666 --> 52:44.194
No. I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about us. Us!

52:45.705 --> 52:47.332
What?

52:48.875 --> 52:51.309
You dressing me, bathing me,
wiping my ass.

52:51.511 --> 52:53.775
For Christ sakes! It's hard
enough to think of you as...

52:53.980 --> 52:56.141
As? As, as... what?

52:56.349 --> 52:58.283
As a wife.

52:58.651 --> 53:01.711
Instead of my mother.
Or... or a nurse

53:06.526 --> 53:11.486
Well, you'll just have get
used to it, won't you? 'Cause...

53:13.199 --> 53:17.465
I don't...
I don't have any choice.

53:17.737 --> 53:21.764
You're right, I'll get used to it.
I guess I have to get used to it.

53:22.709 --> 53:25.769
Do not tell a soul.

53:32.151 --> 53:34.779
<i>- Oh, come on!
- Attention! Attention!</i>

53:34.987 --> 53:38.514
<i>The Government regrets having
been forced to exercise...</i>

53:38.725 --> 53:40.420
Fuck you!

53:49.335 --> 53:52.566
Attention! Attention! Attention!

53:53.706 --> 53:56.470
That's the last we're gonna
hear from that asshole.

53:56.843 --> 54:00.677
We're taking over this shit hole
now. I'm the King of Ward Three.

54:00.947 --> 54:02.972
<i>And there's gonna be a
lot of changes around here.</i>

54:03.182 --> 54:05.013
<i>- What the fuck is that?
- Number One:</i>

54:06.018 --> 54:08.816
If you wanna eat,
you'll have to pay for it.

54:10.189 --> 54:12.714
And that's pretty much it, I guess.

54:14.127 --> 54:16.994
Okay, and now,
for our "grand finale"...

54:17.196 --> 54:20.324
a little song that comes
from the bottom of my heart.

54:20.533 --> 54:22.899
And it goes something like this:

54:23.770 --> 54:30.334
<i>I just called
To say I love you</i>

54:30.943 --> 54:35.778
<i>- I just called to say...
- I'm turning it off.</i>

54:36.048 --> 54:41.179
- I'm turning it off.
- No, no!

54:41.387 --> 54:47.257
<i>I just called to say
How much I care</i>

54:48.561 --> 54:55.228
<i>I just called
To say I love you</i>

54:56.669 --> 55:01.368
<i>And I mean it from the bottom...</i>

55:07.180 --> 55:11.446
- I gotta push it!
- I've done it!

55:12.218 --> 55:13.446
Stop it!

55:13.653 --> 55:15.382
Stop it!

55:19.225 --> 55:21.193
Shut up! Shut up!

55:22.428 --> 55:27.024
Shut up! Or I'll just keep on
shooting 'till somebody gets hit.

55:27.233 --> 55:31.431
- Back off...
- God, you blind people are stupid.

55:31.637 --> 55:35.198
Screaming and crying like babies.
Makes me ashamed to be one of you!

55:35.408 --> 55:39.367
Ward Three is going to take
charge of the food right now.

55:39.579 --> 55:41.308
- What?
- Like in a store!

55:41.514 --> 55:44.210
And like in the real world,
we're gonna guard our store!

55:44.417 --> 55:46.385
So, don't even think
of breaking in, okay?

55:46.619 --> 55:48.450
So, how... how do we pay for it?

55:48.654 --> 55:51.418
Excuse me.
Did I ask for any questions?

55:52.325 --> 55:54.452
He means... he means
explain your rules.

55:54.660 --> 55:56.184
How. What. What do
you want us to do?

55:56.395 --> 55:58.488
Do want us to come one at a time,
or all together. What do you want?

55:58.698 --> 56:01.428
- He said shut up!
- Okay. I'll tell you what!

56:01.634 --> 56:05.866
We're gonna pile up the food, and
we'll let you know the rules later.

56:06.772 --> 56:09.070
Now go back to your wards,
and get your money ready, okay?

56:09.275 --> 56:12.642
- You know we don't have any money!
- Well, then whatever you got, lady!

56:12.845 --> 56:15.313
Shoot her right now.
I mean, one less mouth to feed.

56:15.514 --> 56:18.483
If I had eyes, she'd be
dead already, I tell you.

56:18.684 --> 56:21.551
Now. Jewelry, lady.

56:21.754 --> 56:24.848
For example, watches,
electronic shit.

56:25.057 --> 56:26.581
Anything, anything you
think we might like.

56:26.792 --> 56:27.986
- Excuse me?
- Yes? Yes?

56:28.194 --> 56:33.257
- But how much is it for a meal?
- Well, man. I don't know!

56:33.466 --> 56:36.663
Get your stuff together, and we'll
let you know what you deserve, okay?

56:36.869 --> 56:39.929
And by the way!
Don't, don't hide anything!

56:40.139 --> 56:44.769
All right? Understood?
Let's go! Let's go!

56:45.311 --> 56:49.077
Lady? Lady?
Lady, I'll never forget your voice.

56:49.282 --> 56:51.182
And I won't forget your face.

56:52.585 --> 56:55.986
What the...
What the fuck?

56:56.789 --> 56:57.983
Fuck.

56:58.357 --> 57:00.348
- This is wrong, man.
- It's wrong but what else can we do?

57:00.559 --> 57:02.652
- There's nothing to do.
- We can stick together...

57:02.862 --> 57:05.353
...and just tell them "no. "
- We're going to stick together.

57:05.564 --> 57:09.056
I'm not giving my stuff up
because a nigger says I have to.

57:09.268 --> 57:11.065
Hey, we don't know
what race he is, man.

57:11.270 --> 57:15.172
- I can tell by his voice.
- Fuck you.

57:15.875 --> 57:18.366
- Who the hell are these people?
- This is absolute bull shit!

57:18.577 --> 57:20.204
We don't have to do
whatever the fuck they say!

57:20.413 --> 57:23.405
Cause they make an announcement!
We don't have to back down!

57:23.616 --> 57:25.277
- We can stand up to these guys!
- You're right!

57:25.818 --> 57:28.343
- It's true.
- We don't have a choice.

57:28.554 --> 57:31.022
- What?
- They've a weapon. They've a gun.

57:31.223 --> 57:33.487
But the point is they
can't shoot us all!

57:33.693 --> 57:35.285
Yeah, exactly!

57:35.494 --> 57:37.985
Yes, but if they kill one of us,
then, it's too many!

57:38.197 --> 57:41.064
I'm going to collect the valuables!

57:41.267 --> 57:43.258
No one has to give if
they don't want to.

57:43.469 --> 57:46.768
But don't expect to be fed at
the expense of the rest of us.

57:46.973 --> 57:48.907
- Here.
- I don't have anything.

57:49.842 --> 57:52.242
Don't worry.
I'll be like your mom, okay?

57:52.445 --> 57:53.639
I'll pay for us both.

57:53.846 --> 57:56.371
- What if you don't have anything?
- It's just jewelry, everybody.

57:56.582 --> 57:58.607
What can we do with
it in here, anyway?

57:59.318 --> 58:01.786
Each give according to what
they have, and all that.

58:01.988 --> 58:03.421
Thank you.

58:04.423 --> 58:06.516
Well, they better come
through with the food.

58:06.792 --> 58:08.692
Why are we doing this?

59:05.051 --> 59:08.043
This is what? Plastic?
There's so much junk.

59:09.822 --> 59:13.087
You know,
I thought I told someone...

59:13.292 --> 59:15.692
to just tell them not to even
bother putting the plastic in...

59:15.895 --> 59:18.921
...because it's a waste of my time.
- I'll tell them. I'll tell them.

59:19.131 --> 59:22.328
These have some weight.
That's gold.

59:23.636 --> 59:25.297
Two rings, possibly a diamond.

59:25.671 --> 59:28.003
Yeah? That's good.

59:29.075 --> 59:30.770
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

59:32.144 --> 59:34.203
Got something here.
We're fine with these people.

59:34.547 --> 59:39.450
- Okay, good. That was close.
- It was actually, but it's okay.

59:40.219 --> 59:42.244
- All right, one.
- One.

59:42.655 --> 59:43.781
- Two.
- Two.

59:43.989 --> 59:45.650
- And... three.
- Three.

59:45.858 --> 59:46.882
- That's it.
- Three?

59:47.093 --> 59:48.424
We normally get four
when we go by ourselves.

59:48.627 --> 59:51.824
Well, now you get three. You keep
whining, you'll get two! Next!

59:52.565 --> 59:54.032
We're coming!

59:54.233 --> 59:56.167
- Next!
- We're here.

59:56.535 --> 59:57.934
All right.

59:58.771 --> 01:00:00.966
- We're from Ward One.
- Ward One?

01:00:01.173 --> 01:00:03.141
Don't handle me!

01:00:04.076 --> 01:00:06.476
Okay, okay.

01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.778
We're not gonna hurt you here.
Want your food?

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.744
- Watch your manners.
- All right, it's here, it's here.

01:00:15.454 --> 01:00:19.481
- I wonder. Can I touch this?
- Oh, man!

01:00:19.692 --> 01:00:23.594
- Shit. Fell down.
- I think we've done.

01:00:23.796 --> 01:00:25.423
Fuck!

01:00:26.065 --> 01:00:29.125
- Nail polish, nail polish.
- We got some good stuff here.

01:00:29.768 --> 01:00:31.963
- Yeah?
- Looking pretty good so far.

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:33.832
Yeah? Yeah, we're good?

01:00:35.808 --> 01:00:38.572
All right.
Take it, take it.

01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:48.511
- You're blind.
- Thank you, professor.

01:00:48.721 --> 01:00:51.189
You're using a Braille writer.

01:00:51.423 --> 01:00:54.586
No, you...
You're a normal blind person.

01:00:54.793 --> 01:00:57.193
No, he's not normal.
He was born blind.

01:00:57.396 --> 01:01:00.331
That makes him some kind of
super hero in a world like this.

01:01:01.133 --> 01:01:03.465
- So you better watch out.
- You of all people...

01:01:03.669 --> 01:01:06.035
born blind should
understand empathy...

01:01:06.238 --> 01:01:08.365
...and human decency.
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:01:08.574 --> 01:01:12.510
He's blind. That's all.
That doesn't make him good or bad.

01:01:12.711 --> 01:01:15.771
That just makes him blind.
And now, he's blind with a purpose.

01:01:15.981 --> 01:01:19.473
Because he's looking out for the
sick and the hungry of his own ward.

01:01:19.685 --> 01:01:22.176
- That's right.
- How do you sleep with yourself?

01:01:25.024 --> 01:01:27.117
That's all we get?
Is two boxes?

01:01:27.326 --> 01:01:31.057
- Yeah, that's it.
- But the others got a third box.

01:01:31.263 --> 01:01:33.163
How are we suppose to
survive on only two boxes?

01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:36.630
That's it.
That's it, no more.

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.967
- It's immoral! A blind man...
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:01:41.173 --> 01:01:43.300
- It's immoral!
- Shut up!

01:01:43.976 --> 01:01:46.877
Shut up.
Fuck off with the sermon, okay?

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:48.876
Okay.

01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.447
Get your food.
Get out.

01:01:52.751 --> 01:01:57.017
And say "thank you" for
what you got. Understand?

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:01.086
Understand? Understand?

01:02:02.561 --> 01:02:03.619
I understand.

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:06.821
Okay, okay.
Now say "thank you. "

01:02:10.869 --> 01:02:12.837
Thank you.

01:02:17.743 --> 01:02:21.144
- All right. Okay.
- Out! Out!

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:27.185
- Don't let them get to you.
- No, it's fine! This fucking guy.

01:02:27.386 --> 01:02:30.378
The son of a bitch.
He wants more.

01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:34.582
<i>- How many people are in Ward One?
- 35.</i>

01:02:34.793 --> 01:02:39.162
We only have 24 meals, so everyone
is gonna have to share.

01:02:39.365 --> 01:02:40.491
- What?
- I'm sorry.

01:02:40.699 --> 01:02:43.793
- This is all they gave us.
- Quit shoving, everybody! Relax!

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.404
Just find a partner.
Find a partner.

01:02:47.606 --> 01:02:50.006
Two people to a meal.
Please!

01:02:50.209 --> 01:02:52.871
Just don't push, okay?
Just stay in the line, okay?

01:02:53.078 --> 01:02:54.841
Guys, guys, stop pushing!

01:03:00.552 --> 01:03:02.543
- Wanna eat something?
- Stop.

01:03:02.755 --> 01:03:05.246
You have to eat something.
You have to eat a little something.

01:03:05.457 --> 01:03:07.425
Stop it!

01:03:39.158 --> 01:03:41.092
Doctor?

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:43.890
- Are you here?
- Yes, I'm here.

01:03:48.133 --> 01:03:49.896
Here.

01:03:51.203 --> 01:03:53.603
Here. Here.

01:03:55.307 --> 01:03:57.741
- I brought you some food.
- No. Jesus Christ, no.

01:03:57.943 --> 01:04:00.503
- This place is a toilet!
- It's not your fault.

01:04:00.713 --> 01:04:03.580
- You did everything you could.
- No, no, I didn't.

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:06.449
The son of a bitch, he had
his gun right in my throat.

01:04:06.652 --> 01:04:08.347
- Exactly.
- I could've reached and taken it...

01:04:08.554 --> 01:04:11.421
...but.
- And then what? And then what?

01:04:13.992 --> 01:04:14.822
I don't know.

01:04:15.027 --> 01:04:17.359
If you did kill him it
would've been way worse.

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:21.431
You would've started a
war for sure. A real war.

01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:25.469
You're right.

01:04:26.205 --> 01:04:29.663
Yeah, you're right. I'll pretend
like I thought that one through.

01:04:30.342 --> 01:04:34.608
And it's not easy knowing that
you've killed someone. Like I did.

01:06:27.593 --> 01:06:29.720
Oh, God!

01:06:38.303 --> 01:06:41.033
- Hello?
- Don't say anything.

01:06:42.241 --> 01:06:45.574
It'll be easier for
me to understand.

01:06:46.545 --> 01:06:49.309
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
I wanted.

01:06:49.515 --> 01:06:53.713
Let's be quiet.
Let's all be quiet.

01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:05.560
I can see.

01:07:06.198 --> 01:07:08.257
I knew that.

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.659
- At least I think I knew.
- It's a secret.

01:07:41.066 --> 01:07:42.226
So...

01:07:42.434 --> 01:07:44.868
it's been like a week or so...

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:48.198
and you people have
nothing left to offer.

01:07:49.041 --> 01:07:52.977
So at Ward Three,
we came up with a new plan.

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:55.979
Bring us your women.

01:07:56.582 --> 01:07:59.676
Women for food.

01:08:00.786 --> 01:08:02.515
Have a good day.

01:08:10.529 --> 01:08:13.828
What's going on?
We haven't eaten in three days!

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:20.131
We gave you all the food we have!
It's up to you to ration it!

01:08:20.372 --> 01:08:23.671
Distribution is your problem!

01:08:26.578 --> 01:08:29.171
- Asshole.
- Forget it! We're not doing that!

01:08:29.381 --> 01:08:31.439
- Do you have any better idea?
- I'm not. I'm not. I'm not going!

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:33.810
I'm not gonna go!

01:08:34.019 --> 01:08:35.680
- No!
- Bull shit!

01:08:35.886 --> 01:08:38.117
No one's asking you to go.

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:42.582
Certainly not the men from this ward.
So, you can't blame us.

01:08:42.794 --> 01:08:44.886
I think she brings up a good point.

01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:47.425
And I think we should ask
if there are any volunteers.

01:08:47.633 --> 01:08:50.100
- "Volunteers?"
- What are you talking about?

01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:54.261
Look, if there are any volunteers,
I think they should say so now.

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:58.598
I wonder how many volunteers would
we have if he said send us your men?

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:01.801
- It's not the same.
- Oh, really? And why's that?

01:09:02.014 --> 01:09:03.572
Because it's just not.

01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:06.912
- Because there's no fags here.
- Well, there's no whores either!

01:09:07.118 --> 01:09:10.087
- That's debatable.
- I gave myself to you out of pity...

01:09:10.287 --> 01:09:12.848
and now you think I'm some
sort of goddamn whore?

01:09:14.693 --> 01:09:16.627
- Doctor?
- What?

01:09:16.828 --> 01:09:21.527
Are you asking me for a
deliberation here? I mean, my God!

01:09:21.966 --> 01:09:24.595
Of course I would rather
that my wife didn't go.

01:09:25.237 --> 01:09:28.934
But, what I want really doesn't
matter. It's completely up to her.

01:09:29.573 --> 01:09:31.837
My "male pride", of course,
is gonna be hurt.

01:09:32.277 --> 01:09:34.404
But if that even exists in here,
what does it matter anyway?

01:09:34.613 --> 01:09:37.309
We're all starving to death.

01:09:38.116 --> 01:09:40.380
So, I just think that people should
do whatever they feel like doing...

01:09:40.585 --> 01:09:44.645
according to whatever
morality they have left.

01:09:45.756 --> 01:09:47.917
There's nobody, forget it!

01:09:49.461 --> 01:09:51.895
Anybody.

01:10:03.675 --> 01:10:05.905
- I'll go.
- No.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.778
I'll go with her.

01:10:12.617 --> 01:10:14.676
Me too.

01:10:16.021 --> 01:10:19.855
- All right, all right. I'll go too.
- I'll go too.

01:10:22.327 --> 01:10:26.991
Well, you do whatever you like,
but my wife is going nowhere.

01:10:27.666 --> 01:10:30.430
Dignity has no price.

01:10:31.069 --> 01:10:33.629
No one knows how
many women are here.

01:10:33.839 --> 01:10:36.774
You can do what you like,
and we'll feed you both.

01:10:36.975 --> 01:10:39.170
And then you can talk
to me about dignity.

01:10:39.377 --> 01:10:43.905
- No, that's not the point.
- I'm no different than the rest.

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:46.076
- What?
- I'll do what they do.

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:50.914
You'll do what I tell you to do!

01:10:51.556 --> 01:10:55.617
- Stop!
- Don't! Don't order me.

01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:02.599
There's nothing worse.
No, it's disgusting.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:05.668
From now on you don't eat.

01:11:06.171 --> 01:11:10.505
How long do we wait before
they come and get us?

01:11:24.763 --> 01:11:27.323
Get out of the way!

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:34.328
Good evening.
How many ladies?

01:11:37.443 --> 01:11:38.933
Eight.

01:11:39.311 --> 01:11:42.109
- Nine.
- Nine? Only nine?

01:11:42.314 --> 01:11:46.114
Well, you nine, will have
to do double duty tonight.

01:11:47.719 --> 01:11:51.382
If any of you is on the rag,
we don't want you.

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.683
We will get you some other time.

01:11:53.892 --> 01:11:55.120
No one's on the rag.

01:11:55.327 --> 01:11:59.661
Then, get yourselves all gussied
up and come over at your leisure.

01:11:59.865 --> 01:12:00.957
We'll be waiting.

01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:03.532
And the food will
follow if we're happy.

01:12:03.735 --> 01:12:06.169
In the mean time I've...

01:12:06.972 --> 01:12:10.305
I have brought you a little
bit of bread to tide you over.

01:12:12.544 --> 01:12:14.808
I think I have one more.

01:12:16.615 --> 01:12:18.742
There you go.

01:12:19.051 --> 01:12:20.882
Let's go.

01:12:54.553 --> 01:12:57.852
There's no point in trying to run.
They have guards.

01:12:58.056 --> 01:13:01.492
At least it would be faster.
We'd be dead by now.

01:13:01.727 --> 01:13:03.854
No one's gonna die.
Come on.

01:13:24.183 --> 01:13:26.651
They're coming!

01:13:29.688 --> 01:13:32.623
They're coming!

01:13:48.273 --> 01:13:51.731
Hey. Welcome!
Girls, okay, don't be afraid.

01:13:51.944 --> 01:13:55.402
We're here to love you. We're
not going to hurt you, all right?

01:13:55.614 --> 01:13:57.377
Guys, don't get too excited,
all right?

01:13:57.583 --> 01:13:59.676
Everyone's going to get
their own girl, okay?

01:14:00.152 --> 01:14:03.644
We don't... Well, we share.
That's how we do things here, right?

01:14:03.989 --> 01:14:07.390
Okay. I want you all in order
from hot to cold, okay?

01:14:07.593 --> 01:14:11.359
The hottest, come here. And the
coldest go to the back of the line.

01:14:11.563 --> 01:14:12.894
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong?

01:14:15.267 --> 01:14:18.828
She's a bit of a dead fish. Take
care of her. Give her some life.

01:14:21.406 --> 01:14:25.308
Oh, man. Where have
you been all my life?

01:14:25.877 --> 01:14:27.845
Do I know you?

01:14:28.213 --> 01:14:30.443
It's okay! Yeah.
I take it! I take it!

01:14:30.916 --> 01:14:35.080
Why are you trembling?
Are you trembling?

01:14:35.287 --> 01:14:38.654
No, easy, easy. Okay.
You two are coming with us.

01:14:39.691 --> 01:14:41.750
Are you blonde?
Are you blonde?

01:14:43.161 --> 01:14:47.791
Okay. All right.

01:14:48.634 --> 01:14:52.798
Okay. A bit on the mature
side, but that's more I like it.

01:14:54.273 --> 01:14:56.537
You like this?

01:14:56.842 --> 01:14:59.106
That's my gun.

01:15:00.445 --> 01:15:02.936
- You like it?
- No. I don't.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:08.212
Lady? Lady?

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.088
Now, that's a surprise, lady.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.287
You're coming with me. If you let
go I'll bite your nipples off.

01:15:16.795 --> 01:15:19.525
Now, come on.
Now, suck. Come on.

01:15:19.731 --> 01:15:21.096
- Come on.
- No!

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.500
I'm not asking, all right?

01:15:24.703 --> 01:15:27.968
- Come on! Come on!
- I could bite it off.

01:15:28.173 --> 01:15:32.735
Try it! I'll blow your fucking
head off! You and your friend.

01:15:32.944 --> 01:15:35.879
Or I'll tear you to pieces.
Come on!

01:15:36.081 --> 01:15:39.175
All right, lady!
Hey! Hey! Back it off!

01:15:39.384 --> 01:15:41.750
All right!

01:15:42.154 --> 01:15:44.349
There you go! Okay.

01:15:46.058 --> 01:15:49.050
Okay, let's just speak.

01:15:49.261 --> 01:15:51.889
Here we go.

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:56.362
It's okay, don't worry. You're so
tense. Please, sit down.

01:15:56.568 --> 01:15:58.433
Get the fuck out of here!

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:03.700
Little bit tense, there we go.
May I suck on your nipples?

01:16:05.143 --> 01:16:08.010
Just a... Just a little bit.
There we go.

01:16:11.917 --> 01:16:16.013
That wasn't so bad.
It's just a little tickle.

01:16:20.459 --> 01:16:24.623
Come on, dead fish.
Move for me! Come on!

01:16:25.897 --> 01:16:26.921
Move now!

01:16:47.119 --> 01:16:49.849
Someone go get the food.

01:16:58.163 --> 01:17:00.290
What happened?

01:17:01.666 --> 01:17:03.896
What happened?

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:42.126
You okay?

01:18:43.068 --> 01:18:44.467
You want another story?

01:18:44.669 --> 01:18:48.298
Women of Ward Two,
tonight is the big night!

01:18:48.507 --> 01:18:50.634
- How many ladies?
- Seven.

01:18:50.842 --> 01:18:54.539
Seven? You sure that's it?
Count them again.

01:18:54.746 --> 01:18:56.509
- Seven!
- All right, if you've got seven.

01:18:56.715 --> 01:19:00.082
How about the boy with
the magic powers?

01:19:00.218 --> 01:19:01.583
- You like that one, don't you?
- Yeah.

01:19:01.786 --> 01:19:05.813
- So, where did we leave off?
- This boy wasn't ordinary.

01:19:06.024 --> 01:19:08.049
- No.
- He could turn invisible.

01:19:08.426 --> 01:19:09.984
He had special powers.

01:19:10.195 --> 01:19:12.322
And he turned invisible
when they weren't looking.

01:19:12.531 --> 01:19:15.432
- All right.
- It's when they looked, he wasn't...

01:19:15.634 --> 01:19:17.829
Good afternoon, ladies.

01:19:19.471 --> 01:19:21.769
I just wanted to make sure
that you've all recovered...

01:19:21.973 --> 01:19:24.737
from the fun that we
had the other night.

01:19:24.943 --> 01:19:28.310
No, no. Seriously, I just wanted
to touch base with any of you...

01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:29.912
that might be feeling a
little bit of jealousy...

01:19:30.115 --> 01:19:32.413
I know that tonight
is not your night...

01:19:32.617 --> 01:19:35.415
but I assure you that our
hearts are still with you.

01:19:36.888 --> 01:19:39.789
You men folk should be
very proud of your ladies.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.515
<i>Very proud.</i>

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.491
Well, one of them was
kind of a dead fish...

01:19:43.695 --> 01:19:46.960
but the other ones
performed like real pros.

01:19:47.165 --> 01:19:49.190
There are only eight of us now.

01:19:49.634 --> 01:19:53.035
- Oh, what happened, did someone die?
- Yeah.

01:19:54.406 --> 01:19:57.807
It's not a big deal, though.
She was kind of a dead fish.

01:20:13.258 --> 01:20:16.159
I'm gonna finish the story later.

01:20:16.361 --> 01:20:19.819
I promise.
I'll finish it later.

01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:09.945
Who's that?
Where you going, huh?

01:21:22.093 --> 01:21:26.860
Wait!

01:21:40.345 --> 01:21:43.246
It's you, isn't it?

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.678
What happened?!

01:21:50.889 --> 01:21:52.049
Help!

01:21:57.028 --> 01:21:58.859
What the fuck is going on?

01:22:00.865 --> 01:22:02.196
I know you're here!

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.868
- You don't even know my name!
- No. I know your voice!

01:22:05.336 --> 01:22:07.395
Just say one more word!
I dare you!

01:22:07.605 --> 01:22:10.699
Your dead friend
said the same thing!

01:22:13.511 --> 01:22:15.069
Don't let them leave!

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:18.511
Do not let them leave!
You idiots!

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:20.144
Do not let them leave!

01:22:20.351 --> 01:22:25.050
- Let's go!
- You fucking jerks, stop them!

01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:28.848
Come back!
Get back here!

01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:34.093
That's it! That's it for you!
Ladies, no more food for you!

01:22:34.299 --> 01:22:38.861
Everyday we go without food,
one of your men will die!

01:22:39.304 --> 01:22:42.068
We collect from now on!

01:22:43.374 --> 01:22:45.035
You missed!

01:22:51.683 --> 01:22:53.913
He's dead!

01:22:54.119 --> 01:22:58.283
What's going on?
Where are you? Where are you?

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:00.458
- Are you okay?
- Just go get the food.

01:23:00.658 --> 01:23:02.455
They told me a man was killed.

01:23:04.028 --> 01:23:05.996
I... I killed him.

01:23:08.299 --> 01:23:12.133
Now there's gonna be a war.
They're going to want revenge.

01:23:12.337 --> 01:23:15.602
We're gonna barricade our doors.
We'll use our beds like they did.

01:23:15.807 --> 01:23:18.105
Whatever you say.
I'll get the food.

01:23:37.866 --> 01:23:39.128
Oh, shit!

01:23:39.334 --> 01:23:42.565
- Barricade it. Barricade it!
- You got the door?

01:23:43.371 --> 01:23:44.702
- Two beds!
- So fucking what...

01:23:44.906 --> 01:23:47.101
if send the women there twice a
month? We'll get fucking fed!

01:23:47.309 --> 01:23:49.800
Stand it up!
Barricade the thing!

01:23:50.011 --> 01:23:53.071
What I suggest we do is we find
out who killed their leader...

01:23:53.281 --> 01:23:55.272
and offer them up like
a peace offering.

01:23:55.483 --> 01:23:59.613
- We don't know what they're gonna...
- In exchange for food!

01:23:59.821 --> 01:24:02.881
They have a stock pile!
We're in a state of war.

01:24:03.091 --> 01:24:04.649
- And we started it.
- Yeah, exactly.

01:24:04.859 --> 01:24:10.024
And I suggest we find out who killed
the leader, and we offer to the...

01:24:19.574 --> 01:24:22.099
Look! Look!

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:25.643
If they won't give us food,
I say let's get it ourselves!

01:24:26.448 --> 01:24:28.245
- I agree!
- Then, let's go!

01:24:28.450 --> 01:24:29.747
Okay, I think he's right.

01:24:29.951 --> 01:24:32.613
If anyone's wiling to go,
I think you should raise your hand.

01:24:35.223 --> 01:24:38.784
That's about the most ridiculous
thing I've ever suggested.

01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:42.422
How about:
Whoever doesn't wanna fight...

01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:46.191
simply slip away right now,
and no one will know you were here?

01:24:46.468 --> 01:24:50.029
And for those that are left, gather
around me, and we'll make a plan.

01:24:51.239 --> 01:24:54.902
Here. Here.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.980
Okay, how many of us are there?

01:25:02.250 --> 01:25:04.343
- One.
- Two.

01:25:04.986 --> 01:25:06.851
- Three.
- Twelve.

01:25:07.088 --> 01:25:09.818
I can see twelve of us.

01:25:10.024 --> 01:25:14.324
- What?
- She can see?

01:25:28.309 --> 01:25:31.870
Don't touch my fucking bed!

01:25:41.256 --> 01:25:45.386
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:26:11.152 --> 01:26:14.053
- I heard something!
- Someone's here!

01:26:14.355 --> 01:26:16.084
- Who's there?
- I heard somebody!

01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:18.384
- Who's there?
- I heard somebody!

01:26:22.897 --> 01:26:25.957
I have a chair over here.
If anybody could happen...

01:26:34.609 --> 01:26:37.169
Let's go, come on!
Grab the person in front of you.

01:26:37.378 --> 01:26:39.278
Stay in a tight group!

01:26:40.682 --> 01:26:42.343
Alright.
Straight ahead.

01:26:42.717 --> 01:26:45.982
What...

01:26:46.187 --> 01:26:48.553
If we go back!
We can't go back! Come on.

01:26:48.756 --> 01:26:50.553
Let's move!

01:26:51.993 --> 01:26:54.689
- What's that?
- Smoke.

01:26:54.929 --> 01:26:57.397
Fire!

01:27:16.718 --> 01:27:18.515
Don't push!

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.449
Fire!

01:27:25.326 --> 01:27:28.318
It's okay! It's okay!
Stay there!

01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:30.794
I'm gonna come in get you.

01:27:37.705 --> 01:27:40.173
Upstairs.
Upstairs.

01:27:49.684 --> 01:27:50.343
Watch!

01:27:50.552 --> 01:27:55.012
- Here. Here I am. Hold on to him.
- They're going to shoot us.

01:27:59.027 --> 01:28:02.963
Guards! Guards!

01:28:04.399 --> 01:28:08.699
You see what is going on?!

01:28:13.641 --> 01:28:15.700
Guards!

01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:31.390
We're free!

01:30:29.644 --> 01:30:31.737
It's empty.
Go on in.

01:30:31.946 --> 01:30:32.935
- Step up.
- We're in a shop.

01:30:33.147 --> 01:30:36.674
Everyone, please, stay together.
I don't wanna loose anybody else.

01:30:37.051 --> 01:30:40.145
Step up. All right.
I'm gonna go look for food.

01:30:40.354 --> 01:30:42.914
- I'll go with you.
- No, I can do better on my own.

01:30:43.124 --> 01:30:45.957
Stay here and look after each other.
It's something you can do better.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:51.029
Get out!
This place is occupied!

01:30:52.633 --> 01:30:56.160
There are other groups out there.
Do not leave this spot.

01:30:56.637 --> 01:30:59.071
I know you can do it.

01:30:59.407 --> 01:31:02.706
But how can you carry the
food back on your own?

01:31:15.823 --> 01:31:18.223
Is there anything?
Is there running water?

01:31:18.426 --> 01:31:20.951
I'll look for bottles.

01:31:22.663 --> 01:31:26.258
- I guess there's electricity.
- No.

01:31:27.668 --> 01:31:31.331
Are there any signs that
people can still see?

01:31:34.442 --> 01:31:36.672
What's happening?

01:31:50.925 --> 01:31:54.986
I miss you.
I miss you so much.

01:32:09.811 --> 01:32:12.780
Here's a supermarket.
I'll go in.

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:14.845
- Okay.
- Step up.

01:32:17.218 --> 01:32:19.846
I'll stay here.
I know my place.

01:32:39.540 --> 01:32:41.872
Stay off my fucking spot!

01:32:49.884 --> 01:32:54.321
I'm coming back! I'll fucking kill
you! You stay off my fucking spot!

01:32:54.922 --> 01:33:00.053
Give it to me, you thief!
You thief! You thief! Give it back!

01:33:09.537 --> 01:33:11.129
Hey! Hey!

01:33:11.339 --> 01:33:14.399
I can here you near
my fucking spot!

01:33:18.779 --> 01:33:20.713
Go! Go! Go!

01:35:03.784 --> 01:35:05.581
What do you have there?!

01:35:07.655 --> 01:35:09.418
What are you eating?!

01:35:09.623 --> 01:35:12.217
Smells like meat!

01:35:15.029 --> 01:35:17.088
- No! No!
- Stop!

01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:20.896
Let on!

01:35:50.765 --> 01:35:56.260
It's me! It's me!
Go! Go! Go!

01:36:05.813 --> 01:36:10.614
Okay.

01:36:11.285 --> 01:36:14.379
Are you alright?
Are you okay?

01:36:16.290 --> 01:36:17.314
Okay. Okay.

01:36:17.525 --> 01:36:19.959
- I have... I have to stop.
- Stop. Stop.

01:36:20.161 --> 01:36:23.096
Stairs.

01:36:23.364 --> 01:36:29.928
- You're all right. You're safe.
- Thank you.

01:36:30.137 --> 01:36:33.129
I've go back and get those clothes
before I forget where they are.

01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.035
Here, eat something.

01:38:33.427 --> 01:38:38.592
I'm just trying to say...

01:38:44.271 --> 01:38:47.240
people screaming out loud...

01:38:47.441 --> 01:38:49.102
that God is hiding...

01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:52.871
that we failed and
that God is punishing us.

01:38:54.014 --> 01:38:58.678
This is not what is happening. God,
it's not. This is not the God's way.

01:39:01.855 --> 01:39:06.121
What is happening to us reminds
me of what happened to St. Paul.

01:39:06.393 --> 01:39:10.124
Paul used to kill Christians,
used to persecute them...

01:39:10.331 --> 01:39:13.459
but the Lord came to
him and converted him.

01:39:13.667 --> 01:39:16.659
And not only converted him,
but blinded him.

01:39:17.304 --> 01:39:20.034
This is what's happening to us.

01:39:34.121 --> 01:39:35.588
- Here!
- Here!

01:39:35.789 --> 01:39:38.053
- Here I am!
- Here!

01:39:39.293 --> 01:39:42.091
Here.
Here, I have a jacket.

01:39:42.296 --> 01:39:45.595
- I have a jacket.
- Thank you.

01:41:16.457 --> 01:41:17.617
That's terrible.

01:41:18.225 --> 01:41:21.524
- Who would do that?
- Someone who went blind.

01:41:21.729 --> 01:41:24.596
And then he went crazy.
Since he couldn't see...

01:41:24.798 --> 01:41:26.663
he didn't want his statue to see.

01:41:26.867 --> 01:41:28.994
- I don't think so, little man.
- I don't know if it'd be possible...

01:41:29.203 --> 01:41:31.899
for a blind man to paint
the painting like that.

01:41:32.106 --> 01:41:34.040
- Yes, they could.
- Or likely a priest...

01:41:34.241 --> 01:41:38.371
who saw what happened,
and had a crisis of faith.

01:41:39.146 --> 01:41:42.946
No, but seriously, all those people
made me think of how lucky we are...

01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:45.209
that we have a leader with vision.

01:41:45.686 --> 01:41:49.122
So, I think it's up to you to
decide what we should do next.

01:41:49.923 --> 01:41:51.356
Well...

01:41:51.558 --> 01:41:55.255
I think we should stay here tonight,
try to get some sleep.

01:41:55.462 --> 01:42:00.866
And then, tomorrow, I was thinking
that we could go to our house.

01:42:01.068 --> 01:42:04.663
<i>It's pretty near here,
and it's big...</i>

01:42:04.872 --> 01:42:07.568
<i>so it can accommodate everybody.</i>

01:42:12.045 --> 01:42:13.945
Where are you, dog?
Still there?

01:42:14.148 --> 01:42:17.777
No. Don't follow that dog.
He'll lead you to a fire hydrant.

01:42:17.985 --> 01:42:21.978
Too proud to be a seeing eye dog.

01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:45.410
<i>Twenty seven.
Five four.</i>

01:42:45.612 --> 01:42:48.376
<i>Black hair.
Brown eyes.</i>

01:42:48.849 --> 01:42:50.441
<i>I don't wanna know
what you look like.</i>

01:42:50.651 --> 01:42:52.846
<i>But how can we know each other?</i>

01:42:53.053 --> 01:42:56.284
<i>I know that part inside
of you with no name.</i>

01:42:56.757 --> 01:42:59.624
<i>And that's who we are, right?</i>

01:43:06.433 --> 01:43:08.833
<i>When you went to look for food,
we talked to this man...</i>

01:43:09.036 --> 01:43:11.129
<i>that was part of a group
that moved around together...</i>

01:43:11.338 --> 01:43:13.033
<i>trying to find food and shelter.</i>

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.504
<i>Each night they slept
in a different place.</i>

01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:18.769
<i>I asked him why he didn't
sleep in his own home.</i>

01:43:19.213 --> 01:43:21.443
<i>And he said he didn't know
where it was anymore.</i>

01:43:21.648 --> 01:43:23.275
<i>- Yeah, he lost it.
- They're welcome to it...</i>

01:43:23.484 --> 01:43:26.248
<i>if they can find their
way to my little room.</i>

01:43:27.554 --> 01:43:30.352
I think it's okay. Here we are.

01:43:30.557 --> 01:43:33.526
Here we are. Looks fine.
Come in. Come in.

01:43:33.727 --> 01:43:35.888
I can't believe it.

01:43:38.298 --> 01:43:40.596
It's exciting.

01:43:42.302 --> 01:43:45.032
Okay. Careful. Just because
the door was locked...

01:43:45.239 --> 01:43:47.002
doesn't mean that no one's here.

01:43:47.207 --> 01:43:49.141
Hello! Hello!

01:43:49.343 --> 01:43:51.402
Hello! Is anyone here?

01:43:51.612 --> 01:43:53.409
Maybe we should take
our shoes off. Right?

01:43:53.614 --> 01:43:55.582
That's a good idea.
You can leave them by the door.

01:43:55.849 --> 01:43:58.477
We don't wanna mess the place up.
We just arrived.

01:43:58.685 --> 01:44:01.381
If you wanna take off
your clothes too...

01:44:01.588 --> 01:44:03.385
we have plenty of
clean ones upstairs.

01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:05.285
- Thank you.
- Are you talking to me?

01:44:05.492 --> 01:44:09.826
No, to everyone. Our clothes
are just as dirty as our shoes.

01:44:10.964 --> 01:44:13.262
- Here? All together?
- Come on!

01:44:13.467 --> 01:44:15.526
She's the only one who can see!

01:44:15.736 --> 01:44:18.364
If it makes you feel better,
it's getting pretty dark.

01:44:18.572 --> 01:44:20.597
All right.
If you insist.

01:44:20.807 --> 01:44:23.367
I'm sure you've seen worse
sights than this old body.

01:44:24.845 --> 01:44:28.008
I want you to feel at home here
because this is your home now too.

01:44:29.082 --> 01:44:33.485
Thank you both. We're all flattered
that you would offer your home.

01:44:33.687 --> 01:44:34.517
It's our pleasure.

01:44:34.721 --> 01:44:36.621
Kick us out when you had enough.

01:44:37.090 --> 01:44:39.081
Or when I become
too much of a burden.

01:44:39.293 --> 01:44:42.490
Just tell me, and I'll just
wander off like an elephant.

01:44:42.696 --> 01:44:45.494
- You're not an elephant.
- I'm not a man, either.

01:44:45.699 --> 01:44:46.961
- You're plenty of a man, babe.
- I...

01:44:50.971 --> 01:44:52.734
I don't know.

01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:59.509
I haven't seen myself in so long.
I must look ridiculous.

01:44:59.713 --> 01:45:05.049
No, no. Dirty and skinny.
But not ridiculous. Not at all.

01:45:05.852 --> 01:45:08.514
- And what about me?
- You're beautiful.

01:45:08.722 --> 01:45:10.280
Yeah. Not like you.

01:45:10.991 --> 01:45:13.926
- You've never seen me.
- But in my dreams you're beautiful.

01:45:14.127 --> 01:45:17.358
How come you never appeared in my
dreams but I know you're beautiful?

01:45:17.564 --> 01:45:21.091
Well, that's why blindness
is a gift to the ugly.

01:45:21.401 --> 01:45:23.096
- Come on, you're not serious.
- No...

01:45:23.303 --> 01:45:26.136
but I suppose I was
more beautiful before!

01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.865
We were all more beautiful before.

01:45:29.376 --> 01:45:31.241
Is anyone cold?

01:45:32.079 --> 01:45:36.038
- It feels so good!
- I'm having a great time!

01:45:52.899 --> 01:45:53.991
Hello?

01:45:54.201 --> 01:45:56.294
It's me.

01:46:04.277 --> 01:46:08.236
- I brought you some hot water.
- Oh, thank you.

01:46:08.448 --> 01:46:11.815
- I'm gonna pour it down, okay?
- Okay.

01:46:15.055 --> 01:46:17.489
- Feels good?
- Feels good.

01:46:33.707 --> 01:46:36.733
<i>I hope we can find
the boy's parents.</i>

01:46:38.412 --> 01:46:40.141
<i>What do you hope for?</i>

01:46:40.347 --> 01:46:44.010
<i>Nothing is more ridiculous than
the desires of an old man.</i>

01:46:44.217 --> 01:46:46.378
<i>Tell me. Iwanna know.</i>

01:46:47.721 --> 01:46:49.848
<i>You wouldn't understand.</i>

01:46:50.057 --> 01:46:52.389
- Why that tone of voice?
- What tone?

01:46:52.626 --> 01:46:54.560
That one.

01:46:57.264 --> 01:47:01.792
What I hope is that we
can go on living together.

01:47:02.235 --> 01:47:05.329
- As we are. Like this.
- Blind?

01:47:06.473 --> 01:47:10.034
For me nothing has been better.

01:47:12.879 --> 01:47:17.316
- I'd want us to live together.
- Together with me, or with everyone?

01:47:18.518 --> 01:47:20.645
Don't make me say.

01:47:21.955 --> 01:47:24.014
I want to know.

01:47:24.791 --> 01:47:27.089
Are we alone?

01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:32.426
Is anyone listening?

01:47:35.368 --> 01:47:37.029
Good.

01:47:37.504 --> 01:47:38.994
Good.

01:47:39.206 --> 01:47:41.731
I wanna live with you.

01:47:53.587 --> 01:47:56.351
I remember that New Year's.

01:47:57.758 --> 01:48:01.558
It was cold, but I didn't mind.

01:48:11.071 --> 01:48:15.007
All right. At this end of the table
we have pees and carrots.

01:48:15.208 --> 01:48:20.077
At the center we've olives in a bowl
and some crackers on a small plate.

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:23.272
And, at the far end of the table,
we have anchovies.

01:48:23.917 --> 01:48:25.407
Anchovies!

01:48:25.619 --> 01:48:28.144
Don't we have a special bottle of
something sparkling for our guests?

01:48:28.355 --> 01:48:31.654
There's nothing like water.
Clean water.

01:48:32.993 --> 01:48:35.757
I'd like to propose a toast.
To our family.

01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:38.994
- To our human family.
- And the dog!

01:48:40.367 --> 01:48:43.234
- And the dog!
- And the dog! And the dog!

01:48:43.436 --> 01:48:46.200
- Salute!
- Salute!

01:48:46.473 --> 01:48:49.135
Much better than any champagne.

01:49:03.924 --> 01:49:06.449
I see you.

01:49:10.597 --> 01:49:15.625
When I touch you like this,
I see your face.

01:49:15.836 --> 01:49:17.895
So beautiful.

01:49:18.772 --> 01:49:21.707
It's all I need to remember.

01:49:27.681 --> 01:49:31.674
- Tell me, is this working?
- Let's see. You take another one.

01:49:31.885 --> 01:49:34.319
Take another of me in the face.

01:49:34.521 --> 01:49:36.352
Blind inspiration.

01:49:36.656 --> 01:49:39.921
There's coffee,
if anybody wants some.

01:49:40.126 --> 01:49:43.527
- I'll have some, please.
- I want some too.

01:49:45.165 --> 01:49:46.427
I need to wake up.

01:49:46.633 --> 01:49:48.624
Honey? Honey?

01:49:49.169 --> 01:49:54.004
I think we should get together
and talk about what we need to do.

01:49:54.374 --> 01:49:57.741
There's not much food left,
and I'm worried about security.

01:49:59.045 --> 01:50:01.809
- Okay.
- I can pour it for you.

01:50:10.457 --> 01:50:12.584
It's hot.

01:50:17.364 --> 01:50:19.161
It's you.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.061
It's you! Oh, my God!
It's everyone at here.

01:50:24.671 --> 01:50:25.831
Hi.

01:50:26.106 --> 01:50:28.404
- What?
- I can see you!

01:50:29.075 --> 01:50:32.101
- What are you saying?
- I can see you!

01:50:33.146 --> 01:50:34.841
- What?
- Yes.

01:50:35.048 --> 01:50:37.516
- What are you talking about?
- Everything is beautiful!

01:50:38.785 --> 01:50:39.979
I can...

01:50:40.186 --> 01:50:41.210
- What?
- Oh, my God!

01:50:41.421 --> 01:50:43.150
- What do you mean, you can see?
- Hey, you! I can see you.

01:50:43.356 --> 01:50:45.324
I got back my sight!

01:50:46.526 --> 01:50:49.120
- What is it?
- Come here.

01:50:49.529 --> 01:50:50.655
- I can see!
- How?

01:50:50.864 --> 01:50:53.128
- I can see!
- You're lying.

01:50:53.333 --> 01:50:57.565
- What?
- Really?

01:50:57.771 --> 01:51:00.865
- You have your sight?
- Yeah!

01:51:01.074 --> 01:51:02.541
You're kidding!

01:51:02.742 --> 01:51:04.403
- You're eyes!
- Nice to meet you.

01:51:04.611 --> 01:51:07.739
- Oh, my God!
- He can see!

01:51:07.948 --> 01:51:11.281
- I can't believe it!
- He sees! He sees!

01:51:11.484 --> 01:51:13.714
- I thought he was kidding!
- No.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:17.651
- Hey, you guys!
- What this mean?

01:51:17.857 --> 01:51:19.051
I can see everybody's face!

01:51:19.259 --> 01:51:22.558
- Oh, my gosh!
- I know. I can't believe it!

01:51:22.762 --> 01:51:27.790
I can see you. I love you guys!
You guys are so beautiful!

01:51:28.802 --> 01:51:30.030
<i>At that moment...</i>

01:51:30.236 --> 01:51:33.171
<i>the same unspoken thought
occurred to everyone:</i>

01:51:34.541 --> 01:51:36.805
<i>"He was the first to go blind.
Perhaps...</i>

01:51:37.143 --> 01:51:40.203
<i>we will all regain
our sight in turn. "</i>

01:51:42.515 --> 01:51:46.007
<i>So the celebration was
not entirely selfless.</i>

01:51:51.825 --> 01:51:53.315
<i>The next days,
the next weeks...</i>

01:51:53.526 --> 01:51:56.757
<i>would therefore be
sleepless with anticipation.</i>

01:51:56.963 --> 01:51:59.158
<i>They would see again.</i>

01:51:59.532 --> 01:52:03.798
<i>This time, they would really see.</i>

01:52:05.438 --> 01:52:06.928
<i>But who would be so timid...</i>

01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:10.974
<i>as to cling to this
blanket of blindness?</i>

01:52:11.211 --> 01:52:13.145
<i>Who would be so
foolish as to fear...</i>

01:52:13.346 --> 01:52:16.747
<i>that its intimacies might be lost?</i>

01:52:19.252 --> 01:52:21.220
<i>And what of this woman...</i>

01:52:21.421 --> 01:52:24.185
<i>who is now so strangely silent...</i>

01:52:24.391 --> 01:52:27.792
<i>who has borne such a
terrible weight...</i>

01:52:27.994 --> 01:52:31.862
<i>and is now so suddenly free?</i>

01:52:32.966 --> 01:52:37.335
<i>Already she could imagine the
voices of the city, shouting:</i>

01:52:37.537 --> 01:52:39.903
<i>"I can see!"</i>

01:52:44.344 --> 01:52:46.869
<i>"I'm going blind", she thought.</i>
