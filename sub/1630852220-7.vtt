01:55.735 --> 01:59.813
- Enzo! Glad you came.
- Congratulations.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.093
Thank you. Come.

02:02.095 --> 02:04.575
- Hi, Rosa.
- Hi, Enzo.

02:05.775 --> 02:07.293
He's beautiful.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.493
He doesn't look like you at all,
good thing he took after Rosa.

02:10.495 --> 02:12.653
Good thing, for real!

02:12.655 --> 02:15.453
Enzo, I'm going to get the party favors.

02:15.455 --> 02:18.573
We gotta celebrate something else
and we gotta hurry.

02:18.575 --> 02:21.933
- The first one to become a dad?
- No, when the drugs arrive.

02:21.935 --> 02:24.253
When and if they arrive.

02:24.255 --> 02:27.773
- Do you know?
- Patrizia said a month, it's up.

02:27.775 --> 02:30.973
But the fucking Capaccios
bought stuff on their own

02:30.975 --> 02:32.973
and they're expanding
behind our backs.

02:32.975 --> 02:35.973
Wait 'til the stuff gets here
then we'll be laughing again.

02:35.975 --> 02:37.933
What's there to laugh about?

02:37.935 --> 02:41.133
The problem's not
that there's no drugs, but why.

02:41.135 --> 02:44.733
Secondigliano's in the shit,
they even had a rat in the house.

02:44.735 --> 02:48.373
- What if nothing turns up?
- What do you think, Valerio?

02:48.375 --> 02:50.813
Unfortunately, it's not up to me.

02:50.815 --> 02:53.295
Enzo...

02:54.775 --> 02:56.653
Why the long faces?

02:56.655 --> 03:00.055
Today we all gotta celebrate,
our family's growing.

03:01.255 --> 03:04.533
I know some are worried,
but I found a contact.

03:04.535 --> 03:08.533
While we wait for Patrizia's shipment,
our ass is covered.

03:08.535 --> 03:12.693
- But we gotta pay in cash.
- And where do we get it?

03:12.695 --> 03:14.173
You'll see.

03:14.175 --> 03:17.455
Now let's celebrate,
let's take a picture.

03:19.335 --> 03:21.215
Give it up for Top Model!

03:23.295 --> 03:25.215
Thanks, guys!

03:32.575 --> 03:34.935
You ready? Make it snappy!

04:04.735 --> 04:08.533
This machine gun's a beast,
I'm gonna raise hell.

04:08.535 --> 04:11.733
Get your piece outta my face.
The fuck are you doing?

04:11.735 --> 04:13.213
Can you smell shit too?

04:13.215 --> 04:15.053
Top Model needs to change his diaper.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.173
Get off my ass!

04:17.175 --> 04:20.572
- You scared, Goliath?
- He's forgotten how to shoot.

04:20.575 --> 04:23.413
- When did he ever know how to shoot?
- Suck my dick!

04:23.415 --> 04:25.973
Top Model's momma sucks dicks!

04:25.975 --> 04:27.933
- Jerk-off!
- Knock it off.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.973
You always take it out on his mother!

04:29.975 --> 04:32.133
- What's with you?
- You're a dickhead.

04:32.135 --> 04:35.653
A little exercise will do us all good.

04:35.655 --> 04:39.173
- Speak for yourself, with that gut!
- I'm on a diet.

04:39.175 --> 04:42.813
I was just fine in bed
with a tit in my mouth.

04:42.815 --> 04:44.695
You got that right.

04:46.375 --> 04:48.655
What's wrong, Valerio,
you wanna go home?

04:50.815 --> 04:54.333
You're so serious...
You wanna spoil the party?

04:54.335 --> 04:57.495
Why, are we going to a party?

05:09.535 --> 05:12.695
The armored truck's
entering the tunnel.

05:16.815 --> 05:18.895
You wanna get out?

05:22.095 --> 05:25.853
It's too late,
there's no taxis at this hour.

05:25.855 --> 05:27.655
Walking's a drag.

05:30.135 --> 05:32.533
So let's do it.

05:32.535 --> 05:34.813
- "Walking is a drag..."
- He's a legend!

05:34.815 --> 05:36.935
Let's do this, game on.

06:12.535 --> 06:14.453
Get out!

06:14.455 --> 06:16.533
Come on, guys!

06:16.535 --> 06:21.695
Get out! Get out!

06:23.375 --> 06:25.175
Get outta there!

06:27.215 --> 06:29.935
Fuckers, they got an escort!

06:32.295 --> 06:34.655
Guys!

06:36.455 --> 06:39.533
- Quick!
- Come!

06:39.535 --> 06:41.293
Guys, come on!

06:41.295 --> 06:43.615
Quick!

06:50.735 --> 06:52.895
Motherfuckers!

06:56.615 --> 06:59.533
The cops! We gotta go!

06:59.535 --> 07:01.735
Hurry!

07:27.015 --> 07:28.335
Close it!

07:33.055 --> 07:35.573
Come on, quick!

07:35.575 --> 07:37.375
Call the doctor!

07:38.695 --> 07:40.535
Get the scooter.

07:41.975 --> 07:45.015
- Let's hurry.
- Go!

07:50.495 --> 07:51.815
Close it!

08:02.295 --> 08:04.133
Go.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.853
Get off here.

08:06.855 --> 08:09.173
Go, hurry up!

08:09.175 --> 08:12.095
We'll wait for you over there. Go!

08:14.415 --> 08:15.935
Move!

08:19.015 --> 08:22.015
C'mon, let's get him on the gurney.

08:24.695 --> 08:28.055
- Hold him here!
- Hurry!

08:30.735 --> 08:32.255
Quick.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.815
You can't come in here.

08:52.535 --> 08:54.933
Enzo...

08:54.935 --> 08:57.175
We gotta call Rosa.

08:59.855 --> 09:03.333
Let's wait 'til he makes it
and we can give her the good news.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.655
Did you see the state he's in?

09:07.175 --> 09:09.895
I said he's gonna make it.

09:13.415 --> 09:16.733
Do you see why we can't afford
any more fuckups?

09:16.735 --> 09:19.095
You shoulda known they had an escort.

09:20.775 --> 09:23.853
I know what I have to do.

09:23.855 --> 09:25.575
I don't think so.

09:27.455 --> 09:30.133
When Nicola came to talk to us,
you ignored him.

09:30.135 --> 09:34.413
Again? You know what your problem is?
You see shit that's not there.

09:34.415 --> 09:37.933
Fine, Enzo, do what you want.

09:37.935 --> 09:40.615
But sooner or later,
they'll get sick of it.

09:41.775 --> 09:43.533
They?

09:43.535 --> 09:47.455
If there's anyone changing
their mind, it's you.

10:38.375 --> 10:40.015
What?

11:52.015 --> 11:53.575
Sasà...

12:08.855 --> 12:11.055
What's happened?

12:14.495 --> 12:15.935
Where's Sasà?

12:47.615 --> 12:49.815
You happy now?

12:51.095 --> 12:53.455
You happy now?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.415
Let's go in.

13:57.735 --> 13:59.495
Bro'...

14:08.295 --> 14:10.055
Bro'...

14:17.095 --> 14:21.093
Pure'n'Simple, Sasà woulda done
anything for Enzo,

14:21.095 --> 14:23.173
he woulda even gone to hell.

14:23.175 --> 14:24.853
For real.

14:24.855 --> 14:27.535
Luckily, only he died.

14:30.975 --> 14:34.013
The fuck you looking at, Pure'n'Simple?

14:34.015 --> 14:36.173
Enzo's at home,

14:36.175 --> 14:40.373
on that nice sofa he bought
without even doing a mugging.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.773
Are you serious?

14:42.775 --> 14:44.693
Enzo has nothing to do with it,

14:44.695 --> 14:48.293
no one could have known
what was gonna happen.

14:48.295 --> 14:50.133
He wants to order everyone around.

14:50.135 --> 14:52.855
Then I say he's responsible
for Top Model's death.

14:55.135 --> 14:57.055
Is that what you think, Goliath?

15:00.615 --> 15:03.095
He's not the only one, Pure'n'Simple.

15:17.575 --> 15:20.135
We'll pretend I didn't hear that.

15:32.575 --> 15:36.333
- I nearly went for him.
- You shouldn't talk in front of Valerio.

15:36.335 --> 15:38.895
What are you talking about?

15:41.615 --> 15:46.253
- I agree with you.
- Why didn't you say anything?

15:46.255 --> 15:49.133
A brother died.

15:49.135 --> 15:52.575
Instead of flinging shit at each other,
we gotta do something.

15:53.575 --> 15:57.253
I don't want to put Enzo on the spot,
I want him to think.

15:57.255 --> 16:00.893
- What the fuck is there to think about?
- About what Nicola tried to tell us.

16:00.895 --> 16:02.215
He was a rat.

16:04.575 --> 16:11.013
That's what Patrizia says.
But I saw him and so did you.

16:11.015 --> 16:15.253
He was talking like he was scared
not like he wanted to screw you.

16:15.255 --> 16:17.415
So what do you think?

16:19.655 --> 16:23.573
Didn't you say the Capaccios
are taking our turf?

16:23.575 --> 16:25.775
So what do we do?

16:32.615 --> 16:35.373
Enzo's a brother, but he's not a boss.

16:35.375 --> 16:38.853
And I don't want to die because
no one's got the balls to tell him.

16:38.855 --> 16:42.973
- I want to talk to the Capaccios.
- You want to make a deal with them?

16:42.975 --> 16:46.133
I want to know what they're up to.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.815
And I want to know if they're
the only ones behind the bust.

16:50.415 --> 16:51.735
And then?

16:55.375 --> 16:57.613
And then we can decide on our future,

16:57.615 --> 17:02.173
whether to stay with them
or with Patrizia or go our own way.

17:02.175 --> 17:03.973
You don't want to tell Enzo?

17:03.975 --> 17:07.415
When it's done we'll tell him,
he'll just have to accept it.

17:20.415 --> 17:25.053
Goliath doesn't know what he's saying.
It's the grief talking.

17:25.055 --> 17:27.453
I know.

17:27.454 --> 17:30.175
It's what Valerio says that worries me.

17:32.015 --> 17:34.095
Didn't Valerio tell you anything?

17:35.615 --> 17:38.175
No need, I can read his mind.

17:44.455 --> 17:46.575
He thinks it's my fault.

17:50.015 --> 17:51.415
What is it?

17:56.815 --> 17:58.815
We gotta see something.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.655
It's Secondigliano.
The drugs have arrived.

18:28.215 --> 18:30.615
You'll see, it'll be all right now.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.055
It's here!

19:28.535 --> 19:30.375
Guys, let's unload.

19:33.535 --> 19:36.213
Easy with this stuff.

19:36.215 --> 19:38.335
Say hello to Donna Patrizia.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.255
Quick, go.

19:54.775 --> 19:57.055
Hurry up.

20:06.175 --> 20:08.095
Bro', finally.

20:12.215 --> 20:14.495
Guys, open this shit.

20:19.935 --> 20:21.935
Check out the trash...

20:23.495 --> 20:25.935
That's gross!

20:27.855 --> 20:30.695
Where's Valerio?
Anyone heard from him?

20:33.935 --> 20:37.455
You know he's delicate.
He's probably sleeping.

20:40.535 --> 20:42.215
Smells like shit.

22:00.255 --> 22:03.053
Now you want to talk to us again?

22:03.055 --> 22:05.413
This guy does what the fuck he wants.

22:05.415 --> 22:09.013
He wants to talk,
then he doesn't want to talk...

22:09.015 --> 22:11.895
Elia, I don't know
if I want to listen to him.

22:16.375 --> 22:21.213
I know you've never liked Patrizia.
It's all the same to me.

22:21.215 --> 22:23.733
In Secondigliano they're raking in
the cash, and we're scraping by.

22:23.735 --> 22:27.335
If you came to tell us what
we already know, you can leave.

22:29.535 --> 22:33.055
Nicola told us the seized shipment
went back on the streets.

22:34.055 --> 22:39.133
I don't know, Elia...
Why did Nicola go talk to him?

22:39.135 --> 22:42.093
Something like that
you'd tell your boss.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.935
Unless you don't trust your boss
anymore either.

22:46.855 --> 22:49.333
And do you know why?

22:49.335 --> 22:51.373
Nicola knew that behind the seizure

22:51.375 --> 22:53.773
there's someone
who doesn't like this truce

22:53.775 --> 22:57.295
because he wants Patrizia
out of the way, like I do.

23:00.495 --> 23:03.053
And you think it's us?

23:03.055 --> 23:06.055
I think you play an important role
in this game.

23:13.735 --> 23:17.773
- And what do you want to do?
- An alliance.

23:17.775 --> 23:20.375
With you and with those
who are with you.

23:21.895 --> 23:24.935
And if we do that, others will follow.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.095
Let us think about it.

23:36.775 --> 23:38.255
We'll let you know.

23:39.575 --> 23:41.815
Take him outside.

23:47.775 --> 23:50.055
This guy wants
to take Blue Blood's place.

23:51.175 --> 23:53.255
Son of a bitch!

23:55.135 --> 23:57.655
Friends... Friends, my ass!

23:59.535 --> 24:02.173
Can we trust him?

24:02.175 --> 24:04.455
Last time he ran riot.

24:06.135 --> 24:08.095
But we had fun, right?

24:13.090 --> 24:16.530
This goes to Vicaria Vecchia.
Get it there fast.

24:24.250 --> 24:25.850
This goes to Piazza Calenda.

24:29.330 --> 24:30.770
Come.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.850
Wait.

24:37.010 --> 24:41.368
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I had some problems.

24:41.370 --> 24:42.930
What happened?

24:44.530 --> 24:47.408
Papa had a heart attack last night.

24:47.410 --> 24:50.328
- How is he now?
- He's out of danger.

24:50.330 --> 24:52.810
But Mama needs me.

24:54.050 --> 24:58.328
You're right, I know how important
it is to have a father.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.730
Valerio....

25:01.210 --> 25:03.050
Your bag's there, come with me.

25:10.810 --> 25:15.330
Come. Go to Vico della Pace.

25:19.330 --> 25:22.490
- Everything all right?
- He said they'll think about it.

25:31.370 --> 25:35.368
Goliath, if Enzo notices anything,
tell me right away.

25:35.370 --> 25:37.090
Don't worry.

25:58.250 --> 26:01.648
One week and we'll get it all back.

26:01.650 --> 26:04.608
We won't get our lost brothers back.

26:04.610 --> 26:08.008
Enzo, you gotta let it go,
Top Model is dead.

26:08.010 --> 26:11.330
Hold your head high and show everybody
we can move forward.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.530
I wasn't talking about him.

26:22.370 --> 26:24.370
I was talking about Valerio.

26:46.050 --> 26:48.608
- <i>Yes, who is it?</i>
- A friend of Valerio's.

26:48.610 --> 26:50.728
He said I'd find him here.

26:50.730 --> 26:53.170
<i>After the glass door,
at the back on the left.</i>

27:21.690 --> 27:24.810
Who are you? Any news of my son?

27:27.050 --> 27:28.810
Wait!

27:30.130 --> 27:34.688
Why are you looking for him?
What is he doing, what do you know?

27:34.690 --> 27:36.930
Get your hands off me.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.570
I need to speak to you.

28:02.730 --> 28:07.008
Stay on Valerio's ass,
I need to know if I can still trust him.

28:07.010 --> 28:10.050
Tell me everything you find out.

29:13.450 --> 29:15.528
Goliath, what the fuck's going on?

29:15.530 --> 29:19.048
Shouldn't we tell Valerio
Enzo suspects him?

29:19.050 --> 29:20.968
What do we do?

29:20.970 --> 29:24.528
The time's come
to take the situation in our hands.

29:24.530 --> 29:27.930
Trust me, or we'll end up
like our brother.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.328
Dude! I said we'd be in touch.

29:52.330 --> 29:55.048
There's no time,
my friends want an answer now.

29:55.050 --> 29:56.930
Has Enzo noticed anything?

29:58.170 --> 30:01.010
I don't know, but I can't risk it.
We have to hurry.

30:08.330 --> 30:12.808
Listen to me. You're getting yourself
into something bigger than you are.

30:12.810 --> 30:15.968
It's not only us behind this shipment,
there's someone more powerful.

30:15.970 --> 30:18.768
<i>You need to speak to him.</i>

30:18.770 --> 30:21.448
- <i>All cool anyway?</i>
- Yeah.

30:21.450 --> 30:24.368
We'll set up a meeting
for tomorrow night.

30:24.370 --> 30:25.730
All right.

30:51.650 --> 30:55.328
What happened, Valerio?
You couldn't wait 'til tomorrow?

30:55.330 --> 30:58.848
- Did Enzo tell you anything?
- Why?

30:58.850 --> 31:02.408
We gotta hurry, I spoke to Crazy.

31:02.410 --> 31:06.850
- What did he say?
- We gotta do it tomorrow night.

31:08.730 --> 31:10.450
The sooner we do it, the better.

31:34.730 --> 31:36.568
What happened?

31:36.570 --> 31:38.088
Well?

31:38.090 --> 31:39.450
Valerio.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.368
Tell me.

31:44.370 --> 31:47.250
We did what you asked,
we followed him.

31:49.890 --> 31:52.490
Valerio spoke to the Capaccios.

32:01.290 --> 32:06.570
At this point we want to know.
Is Valerio a brother or not?

32:10.410 --> 32:12.570
He was a brother.

32:20.010 --> 32:21.650
Bring him to me.

33:00.970 --> 33:04.168
Hi, Papa.

33:04.170 --> 33:07.850
- Valerio.
- You're always here, huh?

33:18.770 --> 33:20.968
Your mother's losing her mind,
she hasn't seen you for a year.

33:20.970 --> 33:23.728
I'm losing my mind.

33:23.730 --> 33:26.128
I can't come home.

33:26.130 --> 33:28.648
Why can't you?

33:28.650 --> 33:32.328
What's going on? Does the guy
who was looking for you come into it?

33:32.330 --> 33:36.328
- Who came?
- A guy with one eye....

33:36.330 --> 33:38.650
Who are these people, Valerio?

33:46.810 --> 33:49.368
You have to do something for me.

33:49.370 --> 33:51.290
Whatever you want.

35:31.010 --> 35:33.768
Wanna speak to those
who want war with Secondigliano?

35:33.770 --> 35:35.770
Here we are, speak.

35:37.570 --> 35:40.248
So Nicola was right,

35:40.250 --> 35:43.688
there really was something big
behind this seizure.

35:43.690 --> 35:45.848
The Levantes.

35:45.850 --> 35:48.170
You got a problem, guys?

35:51.650 --> 35:54.130
The offer's still the same.

35:55.770 --> 35:57.570
Put down your guns.

36:00.770 --> 36:02.690
Don't move.

36:16.170 --> 36:19.088
What's all this show about?

36:19.090 --> 36:21.810
This piece of shit was screwing us all.

36:23.450 --> 36:25.848
He was recording everything
to spy for his boss.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.490
Look in his pockets.

36:45.410 --> 36:48.328
<i>Wanna speak to the people
who want war?</i>

36:48.330 --> 36:49.808
What does that mean?

36:49.810 --> 36:54.048
He wanted to ask you to get rid of Enzo
and Patrizia, but it was a trap.

36:54.050 --> 36:58.650
He woulda gone to Enzo with proof
you were behind the bust.

37:01.450 --> 37:03.490
I want to do the deal with you.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.568
We gotta bring Enzo down.

37:07.570 --> 37:10.330
And who says
you won't do the same thing?

37:15.450 --> 37:17.688
No...

37:17.690 --> 37:20.730
You know that Enzo is loyal to Patrizia.

37:22.250 --> 37:24.170
You think she won't respond?

37:25.410 --> 37:27.970
Lower your gun.

37:29.730 --> 37:31.210
Lower it.

37:36.610 --> 37:39.450
Is it worth keeping an ally like him...

37:43.490 --> 37:45.770
...instead of an enemy like Enzo?

37:50.770 --> 37:52.490
Let's think about it.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.330
Let's go, Ciccio.

38:10.410 --> 38:12.170
You're lucky.

38:16.130 --> 38:18.370
You're lucky.

38:45.970 --> 38:47.490
And Valerio?

38:54.410 --> 38:56.250
He was running away, Enzo.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.930
I'm sorry.

39:31.210 --> 39:33.850
I'll deal with it all,
don't worry about a thing.

39:35.370 --> 39:37.050
Do me a favor.

39:47.970 --> 39:50.090
Valerio has to go home.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.610
Whatever you want.
