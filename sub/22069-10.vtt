02:24.978 --> 02:25.879
EMILY: Hello.

02:51.104 --> 02:51.939
Yeah.

02:53.207 --> 02:53.607
CROWN: Hey, Tommy, do you
know where Nick is?

02:54.141 --> 02:54.775
His phone is off.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.410
I don't know. I saw him
on a call about

02:57.678 --> 02:58.712
half an hour ago,
then he was gone.

02:59.547 --> 03:00.314
CROWN: Dammit.

03:01.315 --> 03:01.915
Do you think
he's still close by?

03:02.550 --> 03:03.317
Probably. Maybe.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.419
CROWN: I think I have
a good lead near you.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.421
An old employee
from Barrett House.

03:08.121 --> 03:08.722
Okay, I'll take the lead.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.291
You track down your boy.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.560
She has a bunch of
old files in her attic.

03:13.627 --> 03:14.228
Maybe there's something
we could use.

03:15.028 --> 03:15.796
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

03:16.797 --> 03:17.431
It's good.

04:43.183 --> 04:43.784
Alice, wake up.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.419
Alice, you've gotta wake up.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.989
HARLOW:
Up and at 'em, agent.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.499
This is your second chance.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.803
Life doesn't give us
second chances too often.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.639
Make the most of it.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.345
Where is Flynn?

05:17.851 --> 05:18.819
Who are you?

05:21.989 --> 05:22.856
HARLOW: I am you.

05:26.093 --> 05:26.927
What do you want?

05:31.799 --> 05:32.800
I want to show you
what you are.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.641
Do you remember the first life
you destroyed?

05:43.444 --> 05:44.678
You were just a child.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.482
But it came

05:49.049 --> 05:50.718
so naturally to you.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.758
"Child exhibits violent urges."

05:58.926 --> 05:59.760
"Impulsivity."

06:00.828 --> 06:01.662
"Aggression."

06:02.463 --> 06:04.097
"Stimulation seeking behavior."

06:08.101 --> 06:10.738
"Does not respond to typical
disciplinary measures."

06:15.008 --> 06:17.945
"Child appears to
fit in with others,
but displays little affection."

06:21.582 --> 06:23.717
"Rarely or minimally
seeks comfort from others."

06:28.789 --> 06:30.791
"Possible attachment disorder."

06:34.695 --> 06:36.530
"Low probability of
adoptive success."

06:41.401 --> 06:42.570
Nobody wanted you.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.106
Too troubled.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.442
Too flawed.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.879
So, you did something about it.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.683
You took someone else's life.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.054
My life.

07:14.301 --> 07:15.703
All these years I wondered why,

07:17.170 --> 07:18.772
why Dr. Shen chose me.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.808
Why me?

07:24.478 --> 07:25.746
Shen was looking for a profile.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.783
A very specific profile.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.754
You had
what he was looking for.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.127
You gave me your life, Emily.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.600
EMILY: I'm sorry...

07:48.636 --> 07:49.670
I'm so sorry...

07:51.939 --> 07:52.706
Tonight...

07:53.406 --> 07:54.241
I finish giving it back.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.777
Please let them go.

07:57.778 --> 07:58.646
Flynn's not a part of this.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.113
Flynn is a part of this.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.016
I was his age when
Dr. Shen chose me.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.853
He transferred in
right after you left.

08:07.287 --> 08:07.988
He would sign us out.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.823
Weekend trips,

08:10.257 --> 08:10.991
the museum,

08:11.358 --> 08:12.192
the zoo.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.564
But they would also end up
at his special place.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.000
He promised he'd kill us
if we told anyone.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.069
Who could we tell?

08:23.236 --> 08:24.271
We had no one.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.608
He had the power.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.980
For six years he tortured us.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.030
You can take it off now.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.101
Logan.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.008
You can take it off.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.279
You see

09:07.915 --> 09:10.050
Shen believed
children who survived
early trauma like yours

09:11.351 --> 09:12.119
and weren't crushed by it,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.822
could be forged
into killer soldiers.

09:15.889 --> 09:16.556
Clinical.

09:17.257 --> 09:18.091
Dispassionate.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.595
Weapons that could be
turned on and off ...

09:21.995 --> 09:22.896
Like a switch.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.068
Charles was
the control subject, and...

09:30.537 --> 09:31.805
I was supposed to be
a perfect killer.

09:32.706 --> 09:33.807
Controllable.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.576
One who followed orders.

09:37.978 --> 09:38.846
A good soldier.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.153
But we were both
failed experiments,

09:46.954 --> 09:47.855
Charles and I.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.099
You...

10:43.310 --> 10:44.377
LAURIE: You're not
the only one who can
start a new life, Emily.

10:47.781 --> 10:48.949
I mean, you'd think
I'd go crazy,

10:51.218 --> 10:51.952
but I didn't.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.189
And it just made me stronger.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.126
Charles and I,

11:00.393 --> 11:01.394
we found out where Shen was

11:02.529 --> 11:03.363
and we took care of him.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.767
He's not going to
bother us any more.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.246
Shen's work was brilliant,

11:53.646 --> 11:54.447
no doubt,

11:55.582 --> 11:56.449
but it was flawed.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.352
He was an amateur.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.288
And I had a lot more money.

12:02.990 --> 12:03.857
Harlow made that comfortable.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.028
I couldn't have asked
for a more willing partner.

12:10.430 --> 12:11.865
Six years breaking you down.

12:13.000 --> 12:13.834
Taking everything
away from you.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.235
Recreating you

12:16.369 --> 12:18.271
then setting you free
to watch your life crumble

12:18.972 --> 12:20.207
around you once and for all.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.979
It all went beautifully.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.517
Nothing would have been
more satisfying

12:31.852 --> 12:33.053
than to see you kill
your husband's new wife.

12:34.154 --> 12:35.823
And show the world the truth
about Emily Byrne.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.095
Sadly, I watched
as you did nothing

12:48.969 --> 12:50.103
Shen would have been
so surprised to learn

12:51.338 --> 12:52.539
that all his work could be
undone by a mother's love

12:53.173 --> 12:53.807
for her child.

13:01.849 --> 13:02.415
Tell me what you want.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.118
I'll do anything.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.988
I'll turn myself in,
I'll confess to murder.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.423
Please, just let Flynn go.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.994
You will confess to murder,
Emily, you committed it.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.096
You killed Harlow.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.165
You killed Robert Semerov.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.901
You killed Semerov right there
in that room.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.469
I didn't do it.

13:23.803 --> 13:24.938
You killed Harlow to frame me

13:25.605 --> 13:26.306
just like you killed Semerov

13:26.706 --> 13:27.374
and Radford.

13:28.241 --> 13:28.541
Well, you're right
about one thing,

13:29.542 --> 13:29.977
I did kill Radford.

13:32.712 --> 13:33.346
You left me no choice.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.083
But now it ends.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.251
The way it should have.

13:46.927 --> 13:47.995
Mom!

13:50.130 --> 13:51.031
No.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.402
Please... No.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.206
But you can save him.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.540
No.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.143
Kill Alice.

14:14.888 --> 14:15.889
EMILY: No!

14:19.192 --> 14:20.093
No!

14:26.533 --> 14:27.434
LAURIE: Go on.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.237
I'll do it.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.341
Kill her.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.080
Show yourself
who you really are.

15:08.976 --> 15:09.676
Kill her.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.687
Emily! Emily, get away!

15:21.688 --> 15:22.322
Nick, it's not me.
Get away!

15:22.789 --> 15:23.490
What's this?

15:25.792 --> 15:26.659
I gotta go,
I gotta get out of here!

15:27.627 --> 15:28.561
No, don't move!
Stand back!

15:29.329 --> 15:30.063
Nick...
I swear to God...

15:30.697 --> 15:31.131
Look at it. Look behind you.

15:31.831 --> 15:32.632
Just look behind you, please!

15:33.066 --> 15:33.933
Don't move.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.002
Stay here.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.436
FLYNN:  Mom!

15:40.507 --> 15:41.441
What is this?

15:44.344 --> 15:44.978
What is this?

15:45.412 --> 15:46.113
What is this?

15:47.147 --> 15:47.580
What have you
done to my son?

15:48.115 --> 15:49.016
Where is he, Emily?

15:49.882 --> 15:50.650
Please...
NICK: Where is my son?

15:51.551 --> 15:52.219
EMILY: Stop it, Nick,
it's not me.

15:52.852 --> 15:53.486
Tell me, where my son is.

15:54.387 --> 15:54.988
Tell me, where my son is.
Alice...

15:55.488 --> 15:56.056
Alice.
Alice.

15:56.756 --> 15:57.390
ALICE:
I know where he is.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.326
I know where...

15:59.792 --> 16:00.460
NICK: Just stop!

16:00.960 --> 16:02.229
Follow her. Slowly.

16:05.432 --> 16:06.199
Alice!

16:08.468 --> 16:09.336
EMILY: Nick, we got to
be careful.
She's still out there.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.104
NICK: There's no one out there.
Stop...

16:11.404 --> 16:12.405
Stop it!

16:16.709 --> 16:18.111
Yeah. Okay.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.246
Crown!

16:20.213 --> 16:21.681
We got a triangulation
on Durand's cell.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.250
CROWN:
Okay, gather around, people.

16:25.918 --> 16:26.619
I don't believe this.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.555
God, damn it.
He's at the cabin.

16:29.056 --> 16:29.622
Okay, let's go.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.624
I want a team ready in five,
let's go!

16:37.530 --> 16:38.198
NICK: Face forward.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.532
Face forward!

16:46.406 --> 16:47.174
Stop.

16:47.907 --> 16:48.241
You okay?
It's okay.

16:54.747 --> 16:55.682
That door!

16:57.384 --> 16:58.085
NICK: Faster!

17:00.019 --> 17:00.587
ALICE:
The lock! Just pull it out!

17:00.853 --> 17:01.654
Go!

17:02.222 --> 17:03.090
NICK: Emily, get away!

17:03.856 --> 17:04.591
Emily, get away!

17:05.092 --> 17:05.692
ALICE: Get the lock!

17:07.094 --> 17:08.027
Get the lock!

17:20.039 --> 17:21.040
Stand up. Move!

17:21.341 --> 17:22.109
Move!

17:24.544 --> 17:25.445
Out!

17:26.113 --> 17:26.713
Are you okay

17:27.480 --> 17:28.181
Come here.

17:28.481 --> 17:29.249
Come on!

17:29.582 --> 17:30.483
Slowly.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.618
Slowly!

17:35.988 --> 17:36.823
Jump.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.260
Are you okay?

17:41.894 --> 17:42.795
Get down!

17:43.563 --> 17:44.197
Get down on the floor!

17:45.598 --> 17:46.533
Come on! Go!

17:46.799 --> 17:47.600
Go!

18:11.991 --> 18:12.625
NICK: Right this way.

18:13.226 --> 18:14.093
Here it is. Here it is.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.196
Go outside!

19:12.219 --> 19:12.719
NICK: Do you see the car?

19:13.553 --> 19:14.421
ALICE: No.
Go straight, go straight.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.700
Alice! Alice, get in the
driver's seat.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.335
ALICE: What?
NICK: Start driving south.

20:02.869 --> 20:03.470
What about you?

20:03.970 --> 20:04.571
I have to go back.

20:05.272 --> 20:05.872
No, Nick.
FLYNN: Dad.

20:06.373 --> 20:06.973
Dad, don't go!

20:07.640 --> 20:08.241
Get in the car.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.471
ERICSON:
I've got Staties on the line.

20:38.905 --> 20:39.539
This is Crown.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.441
I want a perimeter
at the access road.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.609
No one in or out.

20:43.075 --> 20:43.710
Do not advance.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.313
Repeat, do not advance
until we know the situation.

20:46.746 --> 20:47.480
Am I clear?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.416
You got that? Great.

24:16.656 --> 24:17.557
Look what they've done to us.

24:20.226 --> 24:21.027
What?

24:41.748 --> 24:42.715
No!

27:57.977 --> 27:58.845
CROWN: The six bodies
recovered in the forest

28:00.112 --> 28:01.981
were the victims
of Conrad Harlow
and Laurie Colson.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.351
These two serial killers
operated together.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.888
Emily Byrne has been cleared
of any involvement

28:09.388 --> 28:10.122
in those murders,

28:11.023 --> 28:12.725
as well as those
of Robert Semerov,

28:13.259 --> 28:13.926
Conrad Harlow,

28:14.927 --> 28:16.295
and Special Agent Adam Radford.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.165
Ms. Colson committed those
murders.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.368
She was killed two days ago
by Emily Byrne,

28:23.335 --> 28:24.136
in an act of self-defense.

28:25.371 --> 28:25.972
Thank you very much.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.076
So Logan Brandt kills Shen

28:30.810 --> 28:31.778
as revenge for the experiments.

28:33.579 --> 28:34.246
Can't say I blame her.

28:35.047 --> 28:35.882
CROWN:
Then she digs into his files,

28:37.049 --> 28:37.984
finds out about the switch
that leads her to Emily.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.788
She dedicates her life
to revenge,

28:43.455 --> 28:44.791
reinvents herself
as Laurie Colson

28:45.724 --> 28:46.959
and in Harlow she finds
the perfect partner.

28:47.894 --> 28:48.895
He hated Emily.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.329
Match made in heaven.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.098
Leopold and Loeb.

28:53.365 --> 28:54.867
What did you find in those
new Barrett House files?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.070
Nothing, we're looking
for more kids that
Shen might have targeted.

29:03.175 --> 29:03.943
You comfortable?

29:04.610 --> 29:05.444
Yeah.

29:07.213 --> 29:08.047
Okay.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.481
Then get to it.

29:22.728 --> 29:23.529
Hey.

29:26.032 --> 29:26.966
Hey.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.271
You're here.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.306
Yeah.

29:38.577 --> 29:39.345
How do you feel?

29:42.414 --> 29:43.415
On the mend.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.185
You?

29:47.053 --> 29:47.887
Yeah.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.122
The same.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.327
Sorry I doubted you.

30:05.704 --> 30:06.973
I almost got you killed.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.947
I should have
believed you all along.

30:18.417 --> 30:19.451
I hope you forgive me.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.066
Nick, in the hotel room...

30:38.537 --> 30:40.306
I didn't know if I was going
to see you again.

30:44.877 --> 30:45.611
And I just wanted
to relive it.

30:46.212 --> 30:47.179
I did, too.

30:48.447 --> 30:49.448
But, um,

30:51.317 --> 30:52.218
I'm not the same.

30:55.888 --> 30:56.889
I mean,
we're both not the same.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.094
And things are different now.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.096
I know.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.068
You know,
Alice is good for you.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.472
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.343
Alice is pregnant.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.153
Congratulations.

31:29.821 --> 31:30.622
Yeah...

32:12.764 --> 32:13.532
WARREN: This is good.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.435
We needed this.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.304
Yeah, we did.

32:22.241 --> 32:23.209
I bet I put people
through a lot.

32:23.475 --> 32:24.410
Stop!

32:25.511 --> 32:27.213
You did what you had to do
in order to survive.

32:29.481 --> 32:30.649
I know who you are.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.185
I know how far you've come.

32:34.753 --> 32:35.687
Even what you did as a child

32:36.422 --> 32:37.089
is what you had to do.

32:39.591 --> 32:40.326
But now it's time to move on

32:41.127 --> 32:43.062
because that's what
survivors do.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.402
Oh! What is that?

32:51.170 --> 32:51.970
Ma, check this out.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.072
That is amazing!

32:54.140 --> 32:55.374
I bet your Uncle Jack
got that one for you, huh?

32:56.242 --> 32:57.009
Yes.
I love it.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.077
Happy birthday, babe.

32:58.577 --> 32:59.311
FLYNN: Thank you.

33:00.412 --> 33:01.180
Why don't you go show it
to Alice and your dad?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.248
Sure.

33:07.986 --> 33:08.687
Dad, you want
anything to drink?

33:09.221 --> 33:09.755
I'll have a beer.

33:10.556 --> 33:11.223
Okay, I'll go get it.

33:50.629 --> 33:51.763
I told you
I was the second type of cop.

33:53.932 --> 33:54.766
Yes...

33:56.535 --> 33:57.136
I'm glad you are.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.343
I'm glad you were innocent.

34:12.050 --> 34:12.618
So...

34:12.984 --> 34:13.752
What now?

34:16.522 --> 34:17.589
Crown asked me

34:18.390 --> 34:19.358
if I wanted
back in the Bureau.

34:23.529 --> 34:24.463
And?

34:28.334 --> 34:29.368
And I think I'm gonna do it.

34:31.937 --> 34:32.738
But I need
a little bit of time,

34:33.172 --> 34:33.805
first, you know.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.307
Maybe I'll go

34:36.408 --> 34:37.709
climb a mountain
or something.

34:39.478 --> 34:40.279
Yeah, you...

34:40.679 --> 34:41.613
You should.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.319
So, um...

34:48.820 --> 34:49.621
Whenever you're

34:50.222 --> 34:51.257
back at ground level

34:53.091 --> 34:54.593
and if you ever need
any help from...

34:56.362 --> 34:57.529
Boston's finest...

35:00.399 --> 35:01.300
Yeah...

35:03.569 --> 35:04.270
Come look for me.

35:07.873 --> 35:08.640
Thanks.

35:13.044 --> 35:13.845
Yeah...

35:17.883 --> 35:18.550
Thank you for the beer.

35:19.050 --> 35:19.651
You're welcome.

35:22.020 --> 35:22.754
Cheers!
