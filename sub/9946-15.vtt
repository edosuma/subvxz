Come and watch pikeys making a mess
of the lives they were given

00:11.238 --> 00:13.638
by 'im upstairs...

00:13.831 --> 00:17.257
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.258 --> 00:18.367
Stay away!

00:18.368 --> 00:22.159
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.160 --> 00:25.142
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:25.143 --> 00:27.681
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:27.682 --> 00:32.625
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented -

00:32.627 --> 00:36.380
to calm us all down,
stop us going mental.

00:36.381 --> 00:40.828
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:40.829 --> 00:45.068
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.069 --> 00:47.290
You shit on our heads.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.714
But you pay the taxes!

00:52.833 --> 00:55.844
Imagine a Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:55.845 --> 00:58.256
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:58.257 --> 01:02.069
Make poverty history,
cheaper drugs now!

01:02.070 --> 01:04.670
Make poverty history,

down, I go down for a very long time!

Come on, then, get on with it.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.606
Mr Pritchard,

02:46.607 --> 02:50.393
I'm sorry to say that your father has
been involved in a serious accident.

02:50.394 --> 02:53.306
He died earlier this evening.

I'm sorry to hear about your dad.

03:25.237 --> 03:27.606
What's this?

03:27.607 --> 03:29.397
It's our new house.

03:29.398 --> 03:31.958
You, me, our baby.

03:38.745 --> 03:40.326
You're not thinking
of playing today, are ya?

03:40.327 --> 03:44.122
It'll do me good.
Keep my mind occupied, you know?

03:44.123 --> 03:45.766

Just like the pre-match rules say.

03:56.159 --> 03:57.831
Thank you. Fuck off.

03:57.832 --> 04:01.278
Mimi's not coming today, so she's
asked yours truly to escort you.

04:01.279 --> 04:04.292
Just to make sure
you're all sober for kickoff.

04:04.293 --> 04:07.213
You only get tea at half-time
and nobody gets done for assault.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.127
And who's gonna give me the ball back?

04:09.128 --> 04:11.712
It's called an 'at-trick. And?

04:11.713 --> 04:14.318
So don't worry,
I'm not here to interfere with you.

Come with me for one night.

04:39.810 --> 04:42.210
Let me show you
what it could be like, us together.

04:42.211 --> 04:44.234
I can't just leave here for a night.

04:44.235 --> 04:46.196
I'm not gonna leave Jamie

All right, boys, tea's on the way.

05:49.451 --> 05:51.668
Some painkillers for your back.
It must be hurting,

05:51.669 --> 05:54.080
the amount of times you've had to pick
the ball out of the back of the net.

05:54.081 --> 05:55.662
Yeah, cos this lot are running
around like headless chickens!

05:59.687 --> 06:01.075
You can't blame it all on Micky.

06:01.076 --> 06:03.153
What do you know about it?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.423
They're dictating all the play.

06:05.424 --> 06:08.564
You're giving them too much space.
They're pulling you apart on the wings.

06:08.565 --> 06:12.463
Drawing you out wide and then pummelling
you straight down the middle.

06:12.464 --> 06:15.179
But like you say, Chesney,
what would I know about it,

06:15.180 --> 06:16.477
being a poof an' all?

06:20.361 --> 06:24.812
Just for the record, there's more
gays than Asians in the Premiership.

06:24.813 --> 06:27.446
In fact, there's probably more gays
than Asians at United,

06:27.447 --> 06:27.446
which is why they're so successful.

06:27.447 --> 06:31.849
Which is why they're so successful.
Are you saying they're successful

06:31.850 --> 06:34.030
because they haven't got
any Asians playing for 'em?

06:34.031 --> 06:35.134
You fucking racist!

06:35.135 --> 06:36.829
Whoa! Leave it, Chesney! Leave it!

06:36.830 --> 06:39.340

Let go of it!

MICKY: Deep breaths.

Hands up if you want Bruce
to manage us second half.

Full house. Kings and queens.

Ah! You all right, Mimi?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.028
I'm not feeling meself.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.094
Is that all?

07:03.095 --> 07:05.775
Breathlessness, mood swings,
tiredness.

07:05.776 --> 07:08.742
Me skin's crawling with spiders.

07:08.743 --> 07:11.061
An overly dry vagina.

07:11.062 --> 07:12.925
But I don't like to complain.

07:12.926 --> 07:14.298
Yeah(!)

07:14.299 --> 07:16.323
I'm probably dying.

07:39.878 --> 07:41.678

07:41.679 --> 07:45.574

Oh, thanks. I couldn't have gone,
not with my gut.

07:55.564 --> 07:58.928
I think it was that dodgy Chinese
I had last night.

07:58.929 --> 08:00.032
What was his name?

08:00.033 --> 08:03.183
I shagged a Chinese guy once
and ten minutes later

08:03.184 --> 08:04.817
I was horny all over again.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.475
(GROANING) That's racist.

08:06.476 --> 08:08.534
It's a joke, homophobe.

08:08.535 --> 08:10.309
Shame there's no more games, innit?

08:11.299 --> 08:12.550
Maybe there could be.

08:12.551 --> 08:14.683
Why, what do you get out of it?

08:14.684 --> 08:16.737
Kudos, public adoration, respect.

08:16.738 --> 08:19.878
And permission to gaze at all the fit,

and registration fees.

- What's wrong with that?

11:13.097 --> 11:15.467
Women love the gays, don't they?
The gays?

11:15.468 --> 11:18.769
Mate, they go mad for it. They want
to turn you straight and all that.

11:18.770 --> 11:23.482
Yes, Ches, it's a gay tournament,
but first prize is a grand.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.333
That'd cover fees for next year

11:25.334 --> 11:28.155

for a big fuck-off party.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.760

Go gay for pay?

11:31.761 --> 11:35.504

But this isn't real life.

I'd look after you.

12:25.460 --> 12:27.379

I've thought about nothing else.

12:38.622 --> 12:40.453

to form relationships.

13:34.449 --> 13:35.484
Okay.

13:37.728 --> 13:43.917
And pay particular attention to the
places where the lines form space,

13:43.918 --> 13:47.826
areas we can't see,
where innocent lines cross

13:47.827 --> 13:50.512

14:08.334 --> 14:11.391
I probably said the same thing
to you back at school.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.144
A couple of times, yeah.

Er... I'm sorry it's not very much.

Oh, ta. I wasn't really doing it
for the money, to be honest.

14:24.130 --> 14:25.661

the nearest thing to it.

14:31.694 --> 14:33.296
You're not shit.

14:33.297 --> 14:36.163
You made some great sculptures
for me back in my class.

30:40.950 --> 30:43.009
You fucking...

30:43.010 --> 30:46.310
But the thing you need to know
about your dad, Ches,

30:46.311 --> 30:48.479
is that it weren't me. It were him.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.278
He came on to me.

30:49.279 --> 30:50.450
He came on to me.
Fuck off!

30:50.451 --> 30:53.379
Believe what you want.
It doesn't bother me.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.701
But you need to know the truth.

30:56.794 --> 30:59.183
We're going. Now.

31:00.994 --> 31:03.806
I've got reason to believe
that you're not an out gay team.

31:03.807 --> 31:06.225
Who are you, the bandit police?

31:06.226 --> 31:07.488
Yeah, actually.

31:07.489 --> 31:10.709
This was an exclusively gay
football tournament.

31:10.710 --> 31:13.260
All right, all right, we know.

31:13.261 --> 31:16.162
Some of us are gay,
some of us aren't. Here y'are.

31:19.151 --> 31:20.300
Come on, let's bounce.

31:24.132 --> 31:25.736
You can stay for a bit, can't you?

31:32.364 --> 31:33.774
Canal Street?

31:35.689 --> 31:36.917
I can't.

31:38.206 --> 31:39.412
I'm with someone.

31:39.413 --> 31:41.754
Fine.

31:44.826 --> 31:45.804
It was him?

31:48.066 --> 31:49.829
It was my dad...

31:51.225 --> 31:53.227
..who came on to you?

31:54.768 --> 31:56.998
Come on.

32:01.072 --> 32:03.028
(LAUGHS)

32:06.929 --> 32:08.419
Let's go t'pictures!

32:15.145 --> 32:16.157
Shit.

32:17.461 --> 32:19.022
I can't do this.

32:19.023 --> 32:20.586
I'm sorry.

32:20.587 --> 32:22.396
That's mine and Ian's bed.

32:28.900 --> 32:31.935
Let's do it on the floor, then.
Standing up?

32:31.936 --> 32:34.692
No, I don't want to.

32:34.693 --> 32:37.119
I am so sorry
to fuck you about, Marc.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.718
But this would be
the biggest mistake ever.

32:39.719 --> 32:42.984
And I can't do that. Not to Ian.

32:44.379 --> 32:45.896
That's a bit much, innit?.!

32:45.897 --> 32:48.001
Sorry.

32:48.002 --> 32:49.389
Marc?
It's my heart.

32:49.390 --> 32:51.415
(PANTS FOR BREATH) I can't...

32:51.416 --> 32:52.566
Marc?.!

32:52.567 --> 32:55.520
Ohhh! Excited... Stressed...

32:55.521 --> 32:57.066
Oh, fuck!

32:57.067 --> 32:59.829
Fucking hell!

32:59.830 --> 32:59.829
Marc!

32:59.830 --> 33:02.027
Marc!
It'll pass. It'll... Ohhh!

33:02.028 --> 33:04.678
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

33:04.679 --> 33:07.443
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

33:08.336 --> 33:10.691
Hiya. Ambulance, please.

33:10.692 --> 33:13.229
27 Shipman Street.

33:13.230 --> 33:15.114
Marc Arlington.

33:15.115 --> 33:16.388
MOBILE RINGS

33:16.389 --> 33:18.217
***

33:18.218 --> 33:20.971
Yes, a heart attack.

33:20.972 --> 33:23.761
A fucking heart attack!

33:23.762 --> 33:25.992
Oh, fucking hell.

33:27.304 --> 33:29.521
No, no, no, not you.
Yes, he's still alive.

33:29.522 --> 33:31.080
Can you just hurry up, please?

33:32.667 --> 33:34.500
(GASPS FOR BREATH)

33:34.501 --> 33:36.511
Hiya, babes, you all right?

33:36.512 --> 33:38.332
Oh, nothing, you know.

33:39.192 --> 33:42.991
Oh, it's just some shit film.
I'll just turn it down.

33:42.992 --> 33:46.260
Yeah, go for a drink.
Go for a dozen.

33:46.261 --> 33:47.819
Yeah.

33:49.197 --> 33:51.483
I'll just see you whenever.
All right.

33:56.492 --> 33:58.585
He was my father
but he weren't a dad.

34:01.216 --> 34:03.059
He was never there for me.

34:04.692 --> 34:07.808
He never saw me...kick a ball.

34:07.809 --> 34:10.310
Never bought me a pint. Never.

34:10.311 --> 34:12.257
Never.

34:12.257 --> 34:15.212
Fucked off when I was a kid
and I never saw him,

34:15.213 --> 34:18.710
except when I had a bit of cash
and he wanted something.

34:18.712 --> 34:20.373
But as much as I hated him...

34:21.431 --> 34:23.583
..he was my father.

34:23.585 --> 34:24.802
Never a dad.

34:49.371 --> 34:51.920
I'll see you later, Dad.

35:13.436 --> 35:15.165
Maxine!

35:31.930 --> 35:33.679
I think it's egg and cress.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.217
Oh, that will be nice.

35:35.218 --> 35:36.225
I don't like egg.

35:36.226 --> 35:37.238
I don't like egg.
Since when?

35:37.239 --> 35:38.361
I want a pie.

35:38.362 --> 35:40.260
I don't think there are any pies.

35:40.261 --> 35:42.589
There must be. It's not a buffet
without a dinky beef.

35:42.590 --> 35:44.581
Oh, how about a lovely chicken drum...

35:44.582 --> 35:47.560
I want a pie.
Ask if they've got any pies. Go on.

35:48.621 --> 35:51.350
Excuse me, Joe, but...

35:51.351 --> 35:52.875
Do you have any pies?

35:56.670 --> 35:57.489
Sorry.

35:57.490 --> 36:00.701
I'd have thought he'd have laid
on a decent spread for his father.

36:00.702 --> 36:02.215
Did you know him?

36:03.651 --> 36:05.950
Did any of you know him?

36:05.951 --> 36:08.679
Well, you know...not strictly, no.

36:08.680 --> 36:13.484
But, I mean, this is a time
when people come together, innit?

36:13.485 --> 36:15.541
You know, when communities unite.

36:15.542 --> 36:19.642
It's like we were all throwing
flowers at Lady Diana's coffin...

36:19.643 --> 36:20.985
Shut it, Frank.

36:20.986 --> 36:23.004
It's all right for me
to raise a glass though?

36:23.005 --> 36:25.872
Sorry about that, I was checking in 
on Karen. She's...

36:25.873 --> 36:29.257
A bit all over the place
at the minute.

36:30.415 --> 36:32.647
Strictly between us,

36:32.648 --> 36:34.923
we're going through
a bit of a rough patch.

36:36.256 --> 36:37.712
She's been having an affair.

36:42.924 --> 36:45.588
It's over now. I think
we're going to make a go of it.

36:45.589 --> 36:47.386
Enough about me, eh?

36:49.340 --> 36:50.759
Two pints, please.

36:50.760 --> 36:51.408
And that's just for starters.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.066
Bruce is paying, aren't you mate?

36:53.067 --> 36:54.588
Yeah.

36:54.589 --> 36:56.107
Bruce has promised us a party,
haven't ya?

36:56.108 --> 36:59.521
What's that, Bruce? 
Drinks all round? (LAUGHS)

36:59.522 --> 37:01.147
You all right, mate?

37:01.148 --> 37:02.331
I will be.

37:02.332 --> 37:03.816
Listen...

37:03.817 --> 37:06.365
I'll understand if you, er...

37:06.366 --> 37:08.282
What?

37:08.283 --> 37:10.563
..if you've thought about
giving me a blow job.

37:10.564 --> 37:12.555
I don't ever want you
to do it or anything,

37:12.556 --> 37:15.843
but I'll understand if you've had
a sly wank over the thought of it.

37:15.844 --> 37:17.106
Fuck off!

37:33.743 --> 37:35.563
Another beer, Joe?

37:39.032 --> 37:41.472
Listen, I know how hard it is
to lose someone close,

37:41.473 --> 37:42.963
but it will get easier, I promise.

37:44.089 --> 37:48.652
In the meantime, if you need a chat,
a beer, whatever,

37:48.653 --> 37:52.805
if there's anything either of us
can do, anything at all, just ask.

37:53.862 --> 37:55.022
Anything?

37:55.023 --> 37:56.828
Yeah.

38:01.733 --> 38:02.711
Your wife.

38:04.849 --> 38:07.244
I want your wife.

38:07.245 --> 38:10.002
That I've been fucking on and off
for over a year.

38:10.003 --> 38:13.300
We don't want wasting any more time
sneaking around on your back.

38:13.301 --> 38:15.997
So I'd like her to go with me.

38:18.317 --> 38:21.081
I'd like my son too.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.062
You'll be wanting your change, then?

38:37.083 --> 38:39.017
I think you'd better get your coat.

39:13.386 --> 39:15.786
Nothing happened, Ian.

39:16.881 --> 39:21.524
I swear it on my life,
nothing, nothing happened.

39:21.525 --> 39:25.024
I thought about it,
and I nearly did, but I didn't.

39:25.025 --> 39:27.045
I couldn't.

39:27.046 --> 39:29.514
I love you!

39:31.434 --> 39:32.878
I love you!

39:42.314 --> 39:44.464
(SCREAMS) What the fuck?!

39:44.465 --> 39:47.002
What the fuck have you done, Joe?

39:52.256 --> 39:53.653
We.

39:53.654 --> 39:57.285
Karen, we.
What the fuck have we done.

39:57.286 --> 39:58.881
You should have left it to me.

39:58.882 --> 40:00.908
I couldn't wait. Life's too short.

40:00.909 --> 40:02.065
You don't know what he'll do.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.158
We'll deal with it.

40:03.159 --> 40:04.212
DNA tests.

40:04.213 --> 40:09.794
Psychiatric reports. Court cases.
He won't leave us be.

40:09.795 --> 40:10.539
Let's kill the cunt.

40:10.540 --> 40:11.571
Let's kill the cunt.
No.

40:11.572 --> 40:12.630
James!
No.

40:12.631 --> 40:14.045
I said no.

40:14.046 --> 40:16.560
This is my shit and I'll fix it.

40:17.654 --> 40:20.862
I don't need help from any of you
unless I ask for it, you got that?

40:21.897 --> 40:25.688
(KAREN) He's a convicted
fucking murderer.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.714
What's gonna stop him doing it again?

40:32.870 --> 40:36.419
He isn't the sort of bloke
who just walks away from stuff.

40:54.348 --> 40:55.897
(CONNOR CRIES)

40:55.898 --> 41:00.787
We could go. We could get Connor
and leave right now.

41:00.788 --> 41:04.305
No, it's not safe.

41:04.306 --> 41:05.523
He'll kill us.

41:06.688 --> 41:09.225
You, me...

41:17.677 --> 41:21.035
This is when he's at his worst, when
you don't know what he's thinking.

41:21.036 --> 41:23.581
What he's planning on doing.

41:23.582 --> 41:28.257
And this... This is when...

41:28.258 --> 41:32.752
He's either going to lock the doors
and go to bed...

41:36.539 --> 41:37.733
...or...

41:40.035 --> 41:41.855
(KNOCKING)

41:44.003 --> 41:48.303
I've double locked the shop, the
flat. There's chains, bolts, CCT...

41:58.257 --> 42:00.384
What are you doing?

42:00.779 --> 42:02.152
You're not going out there.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.097
I'm not knackering up
my best clothes.

42:04.098 --> 42:04.097
This isn't a little kids' fight.

42:04.098 --> 42:06.202
This isn't a little kids' fight.
I'm not hiding away.

42:06.203 --> 42:08.615
You're not at school. He's not just
going to slap you about a bit.

42:08.616 --> 42:10.137
He's gonna fucking kill ya!

42:10.518 --> 42:11.850
I'll be ready for him.

42:11.851 --> 42:13.000
No! Joe. Joe!

42:19.754 --> 42:21.176
Jamie!

42:25.070 --> 42:27.056
Joe, please don't.

42:27.057 --> 42:28.866
Jamie, I know you're out here.

42:31.161 --> 42:33.038
Come back inside, Joe, please.

42:33.039 --> 42:34.495
Jamie!

42:35.598 --> 42:38.442
(FOOTSTEPS)

42:41.647 --> 42:43.672
We're going to have
to sort this out.

42:46.277 --> 42:47.807
I know that your pride is...

42:47.808 --> 42:48.866
Fuck off! I haven't come to see you,

42:48.867 --> 42:51.428
you weasley little fuck.

42:52.232 --> 42:54.143
Karen,

42:56.727 --> 42:58.149
Karen...

43:00.156 --> 43:01.236
What?

43:01.237 --> 43:03.535
This is your last chance.

43:04.655 --> 43:08.671
Come on. We can work through this.

43:11.742 --> 43:14.142
Come home.

43:16.864 --> 43:18.513
What do you say?

43:36.453 --> 43:39.149
Brought someone to see you.

44:03.778 --> 44:05.118
No! Fuck, no!

44:05.119 --> 44:06.410
It's me dad.

44:06.411 --> 44:08.345
Fuck!

44:11.014 --> 44:12.834

44:14.308 --> 44:16.462
Joe! Joe, get up!

44:16.463 --> 44:18.340
(SOBBING)

45:02.298 --> 45:03.837
Karen's a little bit tired, isn't she?

45:03.838 --> 45:04.941
Shut it.

45:04.942 --> 45:07.957
I've heard she's not
been taking her meds.

45:07.958 --> 45:09.645
She'll go mental again.

45:09.646 --> 45:11.914
Shall we call the hospital? 
Get a section?

45:11.915 --> 45:14.873
Don't worry about it, mate.
I'll look after her for you.

45:16.446 --> 45:19.161
Where's Connor?

45:19.162 --> 45:20.723
Where the fuck is my son?

45:20.724 --> 45:21.999
Far away from you.

45:22.000 --> 45:22.711
Jamie...

45:22.712 --> 45:23.736
Jamie...
Get her out.

45:23.737 --> 45:24.863
He's safe from you.

45:24.864 --> 45:26.469
What do you mean? Karen...

45:26.470 --> 45:27.755
Jamie!

45:29.611 --> 45:32.116
Where the fuck is my son?

45:32.117 --> 45:32.752
Go on, Fuck off!

45:32.753 --> 45:33.794
Where is my son?

45:33.795 --> 45:34.807
Fuck off!

45:34.808 --> 45:36.569
He's my son. I want my son!

45:36.570 --> 45:41.244
Fuck off! Fucking bitch.

45:41.245 --> 45:42.253
Go on, Karen.

45:42.254 --> 45:43.443
Piss off, you fucking trollop.

45:43.444 --> 45:45.287
Fucking slapper! (KAREN SCREAMS)

45:45.288 --> 45:46.705
I want my son!

45:46.706 --> 45:49.605
(JOE) My dad didn't give a fuck
about right and wrong,

45:49.606 --> 45:51.313
fallout, consequences.

45:51.314 --> 45:53.295
Because they never affected him.

45:53.296 --> 45:56.941
Cause and effect.
Whatever we do has an effect.

45:56.942 --> 46:01.830
Maybe not for us, at first,
but for everyone else, it does.

46:01.831 --> 46:03.887
It always does.

46:03.888 --> 46:07.000
The way you live your life, the things
you do, the choices you make...

46:07.001 --> 46:09.649
(GROWLING) No-o-o-o!

46:09.650 --> 46:13.063
...will have an effect
somewhere along the line.

46:13.064 --> 46:15.376
And you might not give a shit.

46:15.377 --> 46:19.349
You're just a butterfly
fluttering its wings,

46:19.350 --> 46:21.386
but on the other side
of the world...

46:23.866 --> 46:26.163
Connor...I want him back.

46:26.164 --> 46:27.597
You haven't seen us, right?

46:27.598 --> 46:29.371
Let go of my son.

46:29.372 --> 46:30.552
We've got family up there!

46:30.553 --> 46:32.327
Loved ones who are
facing their darkest hour!

46:33.457 --> 46:36.105
How's your foo-foo?
It's fine, thank you.

46:36.106 --> 46:40.112
And it may get tough. And some of us
might not get out alive.

46:40.113 --> 46:42.166
Just remember what it was

46:42.167 --> 46:46.781
that turned this country from
Britain into Great Britain.

46:46.782 --> 46:48.181
Check mate.

46:48.182 --> 46:49.182
