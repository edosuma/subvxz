WEBVTT

00:11.100 --> 00:13.133
TOPANGA, HOW COULD YOU
BE SICK?

00:13.133 --> 00:15.500
YOU SAID YOU'D
NEVER CATCH A COLD.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.734
YOU'RE TAKING
THAT TROUT FLUID.

00:17.734 --> 00:19.500
IT'S FISH OIL.
I'LL BE FINE.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.600
TAKE GOOD NOTES.
I'LL BE BACK MONDAY.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.834
I MISS YOU SO MUCH,

00:23.834 --> 00:26.800
AND I'LL CALL YOU
AFTER NEXT PERIOD...

00:26.800 --> 00:27.800
Topie.

00:27.800 --> 00:28.834
AW!
AW!

00:28.834 --> 00:31.367
OH, DROP DEAD!
WE'RE IN LOVE.

00:31.367 --> 00:32.900
NOT US!

00:32.900 --> 00:34.967
DO THAT AGAIN,
I'LL HURT YOU.

00:34.967 --> 00:37.500
SHAWN, I'M NOT
EMBARRASSED ABOUT IT.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.000
TOPANGA AND I
ARE SERIOUS.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.500
WE DO EVERYTHING
TOGETHER.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.400
HI, CORY.
LOVE THAT SHIRT.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.033
THANKS. UNDERNEATH
I'M HALF-NAKED.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.600
YOU AND TOPANGA DO
EVERYTHING TOGETHER?

00:47.600 --> 00:49.133
EVEN FLIRT
WITH LIBBY HARPER?

00:49.133 --> 00:51.033
FLIRT? I WAS JUST
BEING FRIENDLY.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.767
GIRLS LIKE LIBBY HARPER
DON'T FLIRT WITH ME.

00:53.767 --> 00:56.400
THAT WAS BEFORE.
NOW YOU HAVE <i>THE SCENT. </i>

00:56.400 --> 00:57.800
WHAT EXACTLY IS
<i>THE SCENT? </i>

00:57.800 --> 01:01.100
I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT <i>THE SCENT. </i>

01:01.100 --> 01:02.467
IT MEANS WOMEN WANT YOU

01:02.467 --> 01:03.834
BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T HAVE YOU.

01:03.834 --> 01:06.667
YOU'RE WITH TOPANGA,
THEY THINK YOU'RE
UNAVAILABLE,

01:06.667 --> 01:09.033
VIRGO, THEY WANT YOU.

01:09.033 --> 01:10.033
YOU'RE BATTY.

01:10.033 --> 01:12.300
ONE GIRL MAY HAVE
FLIRTED WITH ME.

01:12.300 --> 01:15.500
YOU'RE MAKING
IT SOUND LIKE
ALL GIRLS--

01:15.500 --> 01:16.600
MISSY ROBINSON--

01:16.600 --> 01:20.100
WILL COME OVER
AND SUDDENLY
MAKE SMALL TALK.

01:20.100 --> 01:21.367
CORY?

01:21.367 --> 01:22.500
YES, MISSY?

01:22.500 --> 01:26.000
DID YOU KNOW
THE SUN SETS TODAY
AT 6:52?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.233
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

01:29.233 --> 01:31.000
SHAWN.

01:34.033 --> 01:35.500
THEN THE PAPA BEAR SAID,

01:35.500 --> 01:36.934
"MISSY'S TAKING
TOPANGA'S SEAT."

01:36.934 --> 01:40.100
HOLD ONTO
YOUR PORRIDGE, COR.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.400
SHH!

01:41.400 --> 01:44.200
I'M TRYING TO LISTEN
TO WHAT FEENY'S
SAYING.

01:44.200 --> 01:48.567
ALL RIGHT. MR. MATTHEWS,
WHAT WAS I SAYING?

01:50.500 --> 01:55.867
I--I--I WAS TOO BUSY
ABSORBING TO LISTEN.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.567
VERY GOOD.

01:58.567 --> 01:59.934
MR. HUNTER.

01:59.934 --> 02:02.000
FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT
AND THE NEW DEAL.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.100
DEAR LORD, HE'S RIGHT.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.767
IT'S BEEN MY ANSWER
FOR TWO YEARS, MR. FEENY.

02:11.767 --> 02:14.233
SOONER OR LATER,
IT HAD TO PAY OFF.

02:14.233 --> 02:15.400
[BELL RINGS]

02:15.400 --> 02:17.834
DON'T FORGET,
FOR NEXT WEEK'S ASSIGNMENT

02:17.834 --> 02:19.700
YOU'LL NEED
TO CHOOSE PARTNERS.

02:19.700 --> 02:20.700
SHAWN?

02:20.700 --> 02:21.700
WHO ELSE?

02:21.700 --> 02:23.100
MR. MATTHEWS,
MR. HUNTER,

02:23.100 --> 02:25.600
SPREAD THE WEALTH,
HMM?

02:25.600 --> 02:28.800
BUT, MR. FEENY,
YOU CAN'T SPLIT US UP.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.467
COR, THIS IS
PLAIN WRONG.

02:30.467 --> 02:31.667
HE CAN'T BREAK US UP.

02:31.667 --> 02:34.900
IF I CAN'T DO
THIS PROJECT WITH YOU,

02:34.900 --> 02:36.567
MY BEST FRIEND, THEN...

02:36.567 --> 02:37.800
I'M NOT GOING TO.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.600
SHAWN, YOU GOT
A PARTNER?

02:39.600 --> 02:41.600
GOT TO GO.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.100
HOW DID I NOT
SEE THAT COMING?

02:45.100 --> 02:46.700
CORY.

02:46.700 --> 02:47.700
TRINI.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.500
WHAT AM I
GOING TO DO?

02:49.500 --> 02:51.033
TOPANGA'S MY BEST FRIEND.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.200
SHE'S ALWAYS MY PARTNER.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.567
THERE ARE SO FEW PEOPLE
WHO GET ME.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.100
REALLY NOW?

02:58.100 --> 02:59.100
OH, YEAH.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.033
I COULD CALL HER
AT, LIKE, 3 A.M.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.133
AND NOT SAY
ONE SINGLE THING,

03:04.133 --> 03:07.567
YET SOMEHOW
SHE KNOWS IT'S ME.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.200
GO FIGURE.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.300
LISTEN, SINCE I DON'T
HAVE A PARTNER,

03:11.300 --> 03:13.467
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE A PARTNER--

03:13.467 --> 03:16.400
RIGHT. WE BETTER
BOTH GET LOOKING.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.367
CORY!

03:18.367 --> 03:21.400
WANT TO WORK WITH ME
ON THE PROJECT?

03:21.400 --> 03:22.500
UH...

03:22.500 --> 03:26.000
ACTUALLY I THINK
I'LL GO SOLO
ON THIS ONE.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.233
WORK TWICE AS HARD.

03:27.233 --> 03:30.133
I HAVE THE STRENGTH
OF 10 MEN.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.400
YOU'RE FUNNY.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.800
AM I?

03:32.800 --> 03:34.133
AND CUTE.

03:34.133 --> 03:35.200
NO.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.900
BUT IF YOU'RE SET
ON WORKING ALONE...

03:37.900 --> 03:42.100
MS. MARTIN STILL
NEEDS A PARTNER.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.700
ANYONE NOT
PAIRED UP?

03:44.700 --> 03:46.367
UH,
MR. MATTHEWS?

03:46.367 --> 03:47.600
TAKEN.

03:48.700 --> 03:49.700
UH...

03:49.700 --> 03:50.767
AND DON'T WORRY.

03:50.767 --> 03:54.600
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
TOPOGIGIO WON'T MIND.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.100
ACTUALLY IT'S--
IT'S TOPANGA.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.900
WHATEVER.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.667
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?

04:05.667 --> 04:07.200
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.467
I GO TO PAY
FOR MY LUNCH,

04:09.467 --> 04:12.367
AND BERTHA SAYS
IT'S ALREADY
TAKEN CARE OF.

04:12.367 --> 04:14.767
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

04:14.767 --> 04:17.233
CORY, OVER HERE.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.900
ALL RIGHT, CORENCE.

04:19.900 --> 04:20.900
WHAT?

04:20.900 --> 04:24.000
YOU STILL DON'T
SMELL IT, DO YOU?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.500
THE SHWARMA
IN A POCKET?

04:26.500 --> 04:29.100
I'M TALKING ABOUT
"THE SCENT."

04:29.100 --> 04:30.834
STOP WITH THE FINGERS.

04:30.834 --> 04:33.767
CORY, I SAVED YOU
A SEAT.

04:34.867 --> 04:36.400
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
I'M GOING OVER THERE,

04:36.400 --> 04:39.734
BUT ONLY TO TALK ABOUT
THE HISTORY ASSIGNMENT.

04:39.734 --> 04:40.734
REMEMBER--

04:40.734 --> 04:42.600
I KNOW,
JUST BE MYSELF.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.500
NO. BE ME.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.500
JONATHAN.

04:46.500 --> 04:47.500
ELI.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.967
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

04:48.967 --> 04:51.967
IT'S LUNCHTIME.
WHERE ELSE WOULD WE BE?

04:51.967 --> 04:54.367
HA HA HA.

04:54.367 --> 04:55.500
ANYWAY,

04:55.500 --> 04:59.133
THIS IS MY LAST DAY
TO GET PLEDGES

04:59.133 --> 05:00.734
FOR THE CHARITY WALKATHON.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.500
IT'S FOR THE HOMELESS,
YOU KNOW.

05:02.500 --> 05:06.000
YOU ALREADY PUT ME DOWN
FOR $2.00 A MILE.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.033
$2.00 A MILE.

05:07.033 --> 05:10.233
GOOD OLD JANITOR BUD
PLEDGED TWICE THAT MUCH,

05:10.233 --> 05:13.934
AND HE'S A MAN
OF NO FIXED ADDRESS.

05:13.934 --> 05:16.000
YOU GOT TO
BEAT BUD, MAN.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.233
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

05:17.233 --> 05:20.200
PUT ME DOWN
FOR $5.00 A MILE,
AND THAT'S IT.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.100
I KNEW I COULD
COUNT ON YOU, JOHNNY.

05:23.100 --> 05:24.600
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:24.600 --> 05:26.233
NOW, MR. WILLIAMS,

05:26.233 --> 05:28.500
HOW MUCH CAN WE MASSAGE
OUT OF YOUR WALLET?

05:28.500 --> 05:31.200
I'M ALWAYS UP
FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
I LIKE YOUR THINKING.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.200
AAH!

05:34.200 --> 05:38.133
HEY, HEY, YOU
ALL RIGHT, GEORGE?

05:38.133 --> 05:39.133
AH!

05:39.133 --> 05:40.300
IT'S NOTHING AT ALL.

05:40.300 --> 05:44.200
IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN THE WEATHER
GETS DAMP,

05:44.200 --> 05:46.667
MY JOINTS
TEND TO SWELL.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.100
CAN YOU DO THIS WALK?

05:48.100 --> 05:49.100
I MUST.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.400
ESPECIALLY AFTER
LAST YEAR'S FIASCO.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.500
I WAS A NO-SHOW.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.667
MY KNEE SWELLED UP
LIKE AN EGGPLANT.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.000
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK
FOR $50.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.867
THAT WAY YOU WON'T
HAVE TO HURT YOURSELF.

06:00.867 --> 06:01.867
50?

06:01.867 --> 06:03.500
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S FOR CHARITY.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.300
EVEN IF I JUST WALK
A BLOCK OR TWO,

06:06.300 --> 06:09.767
THE PAIN WILL BE WORTH
THE FEW DOLLARS I COLLECT.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.467
YOU KNOW WHAT,
GEORGE?

06:11.467 --> 06:12.967
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.133
TELL YOU WHAT.

06:14.133 --> 06:16.133
PUT ME DOWN
FOR $50 A MILE.

06:16.133 --> 06:18.700
IF YOU DON'T GET
PAST THE FIRST MILE,

06:18.700 --> 06:20.967
YOU STILL GOT MY 50.

06:20.967 --> 06:21.967
OOH!

06:21.967 --> 06:23.934
NOT TOO TIGHT.

06:23.934 --> 06:26.934
THEN I STARTED USING
A NEW MOISTURIZER.

06:26.934 --> 06:28.734
THERE. FEEL.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.400
YEAH...MOIST.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.500
WHICH SOMEHOW
REMINDS ME OF
OUR HISTORY PROJECT.

06:34.500 --> 06:37.600
MY SKIN REMINDS YOU
OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
NO.

06:38.600 --> 06:39.667
JUST THE LAST PART,

06:39.667 --> 06:43.300
WHEN THE PEOPLE GOT
ALL HAPPY AGAIN.

06:43.300 --> 06:44.700
SO...OUR
HISTORY PROJECT,

06:44.700 --> 06:46.667
SHOULD WE START
THIS WEEKEND?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.700
THIS WEEKEND'S
NOT GOOD FOR ME,

06:48.700 --> 06:50.033
WITH MY PARTY
AND ALL.

06:50.033 --> 06:51.300
YOU'RE HAVING
A PARTY.

06:51.300 --> 06:52.900
YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT IT?

06:52.900 --> 06:54.567
WELL, YOU SHOULD COME.

06:54.567 --> 06:56.000
BRING SHAWN.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.100
ONE OF US SHOULD
DO THE PROJECT.

06:59.100 --> 07:00.400
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

07:00.400 --> 07:02.300
COME ON, CORY,
JUST COME.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.567
PLEASE.

07:03.567 --> 07:06.567
O.K., BUT DO YOU THINK
WE'LL FIND SOME TIME

07:06.567 --> 07:08.767
TO TALK ABOUT
THE GREAT DEPRESSION?

07:08.767 --> 07:11.000
WOULDN'T BE A PARTY
IF WE DIDN'T.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.300
CORY.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.500
WANT TO COME WITH ME
TO TOPANGA'S
AFTER SCHOOL?

07:15.500 --> 07:17.367
YOU THINK YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON

07:17.367 --> 07:19.767
WHO CARES ABOUT
POOR, SICK TOPANGA?

07:19.767 --> 07:21.100
I LOVE THE GIRL.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.567
SHE'S ALL
I THINK ABOUT.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.300
I'M THINKING ABOUT HER NOW.

07:26.367 --> 07:27.400
AND NOW.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.567
I'M GOING OVER THERE
TO THINK ABOUT HER.

07:35.800 --> 07:38.567
I DO SOME OF MY BEST
STUDYING AT PARTIES.

07:38.567 --> 07:39.767
THIS IS ALL INNOCENT.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.600
I'LL GO TO THE PARTY,
HAVE A GOOD TIME,

07:41.600 --> 07:43.033
AND NOTHING WILL HAPPEN

07:43.033 --> 07:46.200
BECAUSE I'M
MY OWN PERSON.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.500
WHERE YOU GOING?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.767
I'M GOING TO
RUN IT BY TOPANGA.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.500
HEY, HUNTER,

07:51.500 --> 07:52.600
TAKE THIS.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.100
O.K.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.033
WHO-OA!

08:03.033 --> 08:05.700
GOOD THING I'M
HANGING A PICTURE, HUH?

08:05.700 --> 08:08.500
ERIC, I HAD TO
WRESTLE THIS
AWAY FROM SHAWN.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.367
HE SAID YOU
GAVE IT TO HIM?

08:10.367 --> 08:12.500
RELAX, DAD.
WITH THE MONEY
I'LL BE MAKING,

08:12.500 --> 08:15.800
YOU CAN AFFORD
TO BUY YOURSELF
A WHOLE NEW FAMILY.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.300
THAT'S A VERY
TEMPTING OFFER
RIGHT NOW.

08:18.300 --> 08:21.000
WHO'S THAT POOR MAN
WITH THE SWOLLEN HEAD

08:21.000 --> 08:22.800
HANGING OVER
MY FIREPLACE?

08:22.800 --> 08:26.700
THAT MAN WILL BE PAYING
FOR MY COLLEGE INTUITION.

08:26.700 --> 08:30.000
WHERE DO I BEGIN?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.100
MOM, DAD, I GOT
ONE WORD FOR YOU.

08:33.100 --> 08:35.467
BASEBALL COLLECTIBLES
ARE HOT.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.500
HOW MUCH?

08:36.500 --> 08:37.600
ONLY 200 MACAROONS.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.100
FOR A SIGNED PHOTO
OF TEDDY "BEANBAG"
BAGWELL?

08:41.100 --> 08:42.100
MM-HMM.

08:42.100 --> 08:43.967
THAT MAN IS A BUM!

08:43.967 --> 08:45.300
NO PICTURE OF THE BAG

08:45.300 --> 08:47.467
IS GOING
TO BE WORTH $200.

08:47.467 --> 08:50.500
THE GUY DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE HAD IN HIS STORE.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.834
WHEN YOU WALKED IN,
I BET HE DID.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.300
BAGGY IS ONLY
TWO HIT-BY-PITCHES

08:56.300 --> 08:58.200
AWAY FROM
THE MAJOR LEAGUE RECORD.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.500
TWO MORE BEAN BALLS,
WE ALL GO TO COLLEGE.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.934
WHO HOLDS
THE RECORD NOW

09:02.934 --> 09:05.133
FOR GETTING
HIT IN THE HEAD?

CORY, SETTLE DOWN.
YOU'RE HOME FREE.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.834
YOU KISSED ANOTHER GIRL,

18:35.834 --> 18:38.200
AND YOU'RE
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.600
HELLO, TOPANGA.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.467
THAT'S NOT FUNNY,
BECAUSE IF SHE--

18:41.467 --> 18:46.400
♪ OH, SUSANNAH, WELL,
DON'T YOU CRY FOR ME ♪

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
EVERYBODY!

18:47.400 --> 18:48.500
♪ 'CAUSE I COME
FROM ALABAMA ♪

18:48.500 --> 18:50.800
♪ WITH A BANJO
ON MY KNEE ♪

18:50.800 --> 18:54.000
TOPANGA, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:54.000 --> 18:56.200
I HAD TO GET OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.967
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT HAVE
FORGOT ABOUT ME.

18:58.967 --> 19:03.200
FORGOT? DOES THIS LOOK
LIKE I FORGOT?

19:03.200 --> 19:05.300
TRUSTY OLD CORY.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.467
I BETTER GO.

19:06.467 --> 19:10.600
I WON'T KISS YOU
BECAUSE I'M STILL GERMY.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.367
I'LL CALL TOMORROW.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.700
LIKE I SAID--
HOME FREE.

19:18.700 --> 19:21.300
HOME NOTHING.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.033
TOPANGA, WAIT!

19:23.033 --> 19:25.233
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

19:25.233 --> 19:27.934
LOOK,
I CAN'T LIE TO YOU.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.400
ABOUT WHAT?

19:30.400 --> 19:31.700
[SIGHS]

19:31.700 --> 19:34.033
ABOUT TONIGHT.

19:34.033 --> 19:36.000
I, UH...

19:36.000 --> 19:39.500
ACCIDENTLY KISSED
MISSY ROBINSON.

19:39.500 --> 19:42.367
HOW DO YOU ACCIDENTLY
KISS SOMEONE?

19:42.367 --> 19:43.667
WELL, UM...

19:43.667 --> 19:46.867
SHE SLIPPED,
AND YOUR LIPS
BROKE HER FALL?

19:46.867 --> 19:50.400
I DIDN'T INTEND IT.
IT JUST HAPPENED.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.567
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.867
WHY THEN?

19:53.867 --> 19:54.867
I WASN'T THINKING.

19:54.867 --> 19:56.500
THAT MAKES IT O.K.?

19:56.500 --> 19:58.100
NO...NO.

19:58.100 --> 20:03.834
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS
I'VE NEVER FELT WORSE
THAN RIGHT NOW.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.133
YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.600
I FEEL BAD.

20:09.734 --> 20:12.100
NOW WHAT DO I DO?

20:13.200 --> 20:16.200
HOPEFULLY,
NOT WHAT I DESERVE.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.700
SO, TELL ME, CORY.

20:18.700 --> 20:22.567
HOW DID SHE KISS YOU?
LIKE THIS?

20:22.567 --> 20:24.100
MUST WE HERE?

20:24.100 --> 20:25.367
I NEED TO KNOW.

20:25.367 --> 20:28.400
OR WAS IT
MORE LIKE THIS?

20:35.100 --> 20:37.500
NO, IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.100
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
ANYONE'S KISSED ME LIKE THAT.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.667
IT'LL BE THE LAST TIME

20:42.667 --> 20:44.767
IF YOU EVER DO ANYTHING
LIKE THAT AGAIN!

20:56.467 --> 20:57.467
HAVE YOU SEEN
GEORGE YET?

20:57.467 --> 20:58.834
NO, WHY?

20:58.834 --> 21:01.700
HE HAD THAT WALKATHON--
AND HIS BAD KNEE...

21:01.700 --> 21:04.000
BAD KNEE?
WHO SAID THAT?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.600
ELI, JONATHAN.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.467
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE
A 10-MILE WALK

21:12.467 --> 21:16.100
TO INVIGORATE THE BODY
AND LIFT THE SOUL.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.133
10 MILES?

21:17.133 --> 21:19.300
GEORGE, I OWE YOU
50 BUCKS.

21:19.300 --> 21:21.734
10 MORE THAN YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:21.734 --> 21:24.667
I CAUGHT A GOOD WIND.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.300
YOU OWE ME...

21:26.300 --> 21:27.867
$500.

21:27.867 --> 21:29.100
YOU TOOK ME, GEORGE.

21:29.100 --> 21:32.934
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

21:32.934 --> 21:35.967
OH-OH. OH, BOY.

21:35.967 --> 21:39.233
BETTER
ICE THIS KNEE.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.767
JOHN,
BUY ME LUNCH?

21:43.767 --> 21:44.800
SURE.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.200
ALL YEAR?

21:47.300 --> 21:50.400
DOES IT FEEL LIKE
KNIVES IN YOUR THROAT?

21:50.400 --> 21:53.133
I HAVEN'T SWALLOWED
ALL DAY.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.400
SOUNDS LIKE MINE.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.834
I'LL NEVER LEAVE
THIS COUCH.

21:56.834 --> 21:58.000
I'VE SENT SOMETHING OVER

21:58.000 --> 22:00.700
THAT WILL HAVE YOU
ON YOUR FEET SOON.

22:00.700 --> 22:06.300
I AM HERE TO HELP YOU
GET BETTER.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.600
ALL BETTER.
