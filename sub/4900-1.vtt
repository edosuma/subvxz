02:13.880 --> 02:19.720
I am the lord of darkness.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.440
I require the solace
of the shadows...

02:25.520 --> 02:29.480
and the dark of the night.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.880
Sunshine is my destroyer.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.520
All this shall change.

02:43.520 --> 02:48.160
Tonight, the sun sets forever.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.400
There shall never be
another dawn...

02:56.600 --> 02:58.600
Enter!

03:09.720 --> 03:12.640
Blix.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.560
Come closer.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.280
You summoned me, lordship?

03:22.960 --> 03:26.520
Are you not the most loathsome
of my goblins?

03:26.600 --> 03:30.320
Truly, master.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.960
And is your heart black
and full of hate?

03:35.040 --> 03:38.160
Black as midnight,
black as pitch,

03:38.240 --> 03:40.480
blacker than the foulest witch.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.240
That is why
I have called you here.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.920
Since I must remain in darkness,
you shall be my eyes and ears.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.920
You do me great honor, lord.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.360
Something troubles me.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.360
I feel a presence
in the forest,

04:00.880 --> 04:04.440
a force I had mercifully
almost forgotten.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.880
Must be dread, indeed,
to trouble you, lordship.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.880
Looking upon
these frail creatures,

04:10.960 --> 04:14.440
one would not think that
they could contain such power.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.240
One could rule
the universe with it.

04:18.320 --> 04:23.520
You must find them for me
and destroy them!

04:23.560 --> 04:28.360
What do they look like, lord?

04:28.440 --> 04:32.920
Fool! Let this
serve to remind you.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.040
They are each crowned
with a single horn...

04:36.120 --> 04:38.760
reaching straight to heaven.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.440
I get the point, lord.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.440
Bring the horns to me.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.640
You will be well rewarded.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.200
You shall be a prince
here in my realm.

04:50.280 --> 04:53.120
A rare privilege, master.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.600
Where shall I look, sire?

04:58.680 --> 05:03.560
There is only one lure
for such disgusting goodness,

05:03.600 --> 05:06.880
one bait that never fails.

05:06.960 --> 05:10.440
What be this bait?
Please, you teach me.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.560
Innocence. Innocence.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.720
Come, white flowers

05:46.800 --> 05:49.600
Weave us a carpet

05:49.680 --> 05:51.800
Spreading oak

05:51.880 --> 05:55.040
Make a shade where we lie

05:55.120 --> 06:00.280
Leaves and branches
whisper our love song

06:00.320 --> 06:05.720
When I look
in my true love's eyes

06:05.760 --> 06:10.720
Young as any spring

06:10.800 --> 06:15.440
His eyes almost sing

06:15.520 --> 06:19.160
To me

07:01.000 --> 07:03.080
Blooming fairies!

08:11.360 --> 08:14.120
Lily!

08:14.160 --> 08:17.240
God bless, Your Highness.

08:17.320 --> 08:20.040
A royal visit's
always a pleasure.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.360
Have another biscuit.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.320
Nell...

08:34.200 --> 08:36.440
I have no time to stay
for a visit today.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.520
Oh, you've got
a sweetheart waiting?

08:38.600 --> 08:43.240
No, I don't. Surely, your
father forbids such folly.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.240
What my father doesn't know
won't trouble him.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.400
Oh, the willful heart
invites despair,

08:49.480 --> 08:52.280
like blind men creeping
in a dragon's lair.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.720
Not a country proverb
nor king's command...

08:54.760 --> 08:56.160
could keep me
from the woods today.

08:56.200 --> 09:02.560
Then it's common sense sort.
Lily. Princess Lily.

09:02.640 --> 09:07.280
I look on you as a daughter.
If you'll pardon my saying it,

09:07.360 --> 09:11.120
it's time you started behaving
like the princess you are.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.880
You should be out looking for a
handsome prince on a white charger,

09:14.960 --> 09:17.680
not visiting poor folk like us.

09:17.720 --> 09:22.880
No. Don't you know
I love coming here?

09:27.760 --> 09:30.560
This place holds
more magic for me...

09:30.640 --> 09:32.920
than any palace in the world.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.520
You live a very rich
life, Nell.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.920
I don't know of a prince
who could carve wood like this.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.680
You're very sweet, Lily.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.880
Magic is a wonderful thing.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.920
You'll find your own magic
one day.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.240
I'm sure you will.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.880
I have no time for this.
I'm going.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.920
Oh, and you look out for
spriggen and banshee, my girl.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.040
These woods be thick with them.

10:07.120 --> 10:11.120
Stay clear of toadstool
rings and willow trees...

10:11.200 --> 10:13.440
and old oaks.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.440
Jack!

10:17.680 --> 10:19.360
Where are you?

10:23.280 --> 10:25.200
Jack!

10:33.960 --> 10:37.440
Jack! Jack!

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Jack?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.400
Jack?

11:01.040 --> 11:03.160
Jack, answer me.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.680
Jack! Jack!

11:19.760 --> 11:21.680
Jack.

11:21.760 --> 11:26.600
Jack, please. Please, if you're
here, say something to me, please.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.120
Jack, you scared
the life out of me!

11:47.440 --> 11:49.080
You're so clever.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.160
Oh, here.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.480
Whoops. Look inside.
See what you can find.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.800
That's something to eat.

12:05.720 --> 12:08.240
I made that for you myself.

12:13.440 --> 12:17.600
Well, I-I took it from Nell.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.840
Do you like it? Is it sweet?

12:27.240 --> 12:30.120
I know someone sweeter.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.880
May be innocent,
may be sweet...

12:32.960 --> 12:37.240
ain't half as nice
as rotting meat.

12:53.360 --> 12:57.800
Good. Very good. Just right.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.720
Jack, now teach me rabbit
like you promised.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.720
Rabbit?

13:06.640 --> 13:09.480
It's much harder than finch. Let me try.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.760
I'm a good student, and my
father says I'm brilliant.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.440
See how brilliant I am?

13:18.520 --> 13:21.320
Let me dazzle you
with my wisdom.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.800
It's much more than wisdom
that dazzles me, Lily.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.760
Jack, teach me rabbit.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.920
Not today.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.920
Why not?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.240
Because...

13:39.480 --> 13:43.360
there's something really special
that I've been promising to show you.

13:45.080 --> 13:48.120
- Jack, do you mean it?
- Only if it pleases you, Lily.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.360
Oh, it pleases me
more than anything.

13:51.440 --> 13:53.760
We must go now...

13:53.840 --> 13:56.960
because they'll only be here
for a short while.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.720
Don't you trust me?

14:06.800 --> 14:09.320
I trust you, Lily.

15:44.680 --> 15:47.560
Oh, Jack.

17:15.319 --> 17:18.839
Look! Ugly one-horned mules.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.640
Nothing is more magical.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.720
As long as they roam the earth,

17:36.800 --> 17:39.680
evil can never harm
the pure of heart.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.960
Do you speak their language?

17:58.560 --> 18:01.800
They express
only love and laughter.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.280
Dark thoughts
are unknown to them.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.680
No! No.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.320
Please.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.280
Lily, no, please!

19:10.080 --> 19:13.080
Come dance, sparrow

19:13.160 --> 19:15.680
Sing me good morning

19:15.760 --> 19:17.880
Rise up, sun

19:17.960 --> 19:20.560
Like the arch of the sky

20:24.400 --> 20:28.240
You'll spook the beast
and spoil the trap.

20:54.360 --> 20:57.080
Living river

20:57.160 --> 21:00.640
Turn the light to diamonds

21:00.720 --> 21:05.400
When I look
in my true love's eyes

21:05.480 --> 21:08.800
Like a child feels

21:08.880 --> 21:11.440
Watching a rainbow

21:11.520 --> 21:13.760
Like a bird feels

21:13.800 --> 21:16.400
The first time it flies

21:16.480 --> 21:18.880
I feel magic

21:18.960 --> 21:21.720
Stirring within me

21:21.800 --> 21:26.680
When I look
in my true love's eyes

21:26.720 --> 21:31.680
Young as any spring

21:31.720 --> 21:36.520
His eyes almost seem

21:39.720 --> 21:42.840
This shot be
just as sweet as pie.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.200
Jack? Jack?

22:20.040 --> 22:22.000
Jack!

22:23.280 --> 22:26.240
It was lovely... like a dream.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.680
What you did is forbidden.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.400
Who says so?

22:31.480 --> 22:35.200
It is known, Lily.
These are sacred animals.

22:35.280 --> 22:39.480
- I don't care.
- You risk your immortal soul talking like that.

22:43.760 --> 22:48.720
I only wanted to touch one.
Where's the harm in that?

22:52.120 --> 22:53.640
It was magic.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.000
Thank you.

22:59.840 --> 23:02.040
Let me sing to you.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.720
I'll chase your fears away.

23:06.800 --> 23:12.520
In the bumps and the hollows

23:12.600 --> 23:17.560
The sunlight and shadows

23:17.600 --> 23:21.560
He kissed her as those

23:21.640 --> 23:25.680
Bluebells blow

23:25.760 --> 23:31.160
As his lips met her breath

23:31.240 --> 23:36.040
He went sweetly to death

23:36.080 --> 23:40.240
At the roots of the bluebells

23:40.320 --> 23:44.240
Is where he is laid

23:48.880 --> 23:51.880
Are you afraid
to kiss me, Jack?

23:51.960 --> 23:54.320
I'm afraid
you'll break my heart.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.400
Then still your heart.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.400
You're dear to me
as life itself.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.280
Don't you wish this
was our wedding ring?

24:03.360 --> 24:05.280
If I say yes,
will my wish come true?

24:05.360 --> 24:07.680
I'm a princess.

24:07.760 --> 24:11.200
It's my right to set
a challenge for my suitors.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.640
I will marry...

24:14.680 --> 24:16.800
whoever finds this ring.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.440
Jack!

26:47.600 --> 26:51.800
Lily!

28:06.760 --> 28:10.200
I smell human flesh!

28:13.480 --> 28:17.720
- After you, Pig.
- Oh, no, after you.

28:36.200 --> 28:39.640
Clock. Mortal world
turned to ice.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.640
Here be goblin paradise!

28:43.720 --> 28:46.880
Plenty hospitality here.

28:46.960 --> 28:49.680
Baby!

28:49.760 --> 28:52.920
I simply adore milk-fed meat.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.280
What are you,
some kind of animal?

29:05.080 --> 29:09.440
How did you do that, Blix?

29:09.480 --> 29:11.640
Yeah, tell us how
you do those tricks.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.840
Quite easy, actually.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.680
Goblin omelette.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.640
Very nice, very nice.

29:21.720 --> 29:26.240
Lucky day! Kill
ugly one-horned dead!

29:26.320 --> 29:30.640
You act like you do all. It was
me who shoot the poisoned stinger.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.360
Me! Me! Me!

29:33.440 --> 29:36.640
You only got the shot in
because the princess was there.

29:36.720 --> 29:39.560
Wrong! 'Twas beauty
led the beast to bay.

29:39.640 --> 29:44.720
She was so sweet.
I could eat her brains like jam.

29:44.800 --> 29:48.080
- I could suck her bones-
- Enough!

29:48.160 --> 29:52.520
Better hurry. Dark Lord,
he don't like to wait.

30:12.920 --> 30:17.480
What have I done?

30:19.560 --> 30:23.200
Four, five, six!
Hurray for Blix!

30:23.280 --> 30:26.840
I'll make it right.

31:07.560 --> 31:10.160
Lily? Lily?

31:13.400 --> 31:16.400
Jack?

31:17.840 --> 31:21.400
Who's there?

31:23.160 --> 31:25.160
Who are you?

31:25.240 --> 31:28.720
Here be forest child
and not know the Gump?

31:28.800 --> 31:32.000
Gump, is it?

31:32.080 --> 31:35.520
Honeythorn Gump
at your service.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.720
I, I must be dreaming.

31:51.800 --> 31:56.720
If life is a dream,
better you dread the waking.

31:56.800 --> 32:00.520
- Jack?
- Stop it!

32:00.600 --> 32:03.080
- That's Oona. She likes you.
- Go away!

32:03.160 --> 32:06.240
Does your blood
run so cold, Jack?

32:06.320 --> 32:09.800
You'll be a gobs
before your time.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.520
How'd you know my name?

32:14.720 --> 32:18.160
How does a migrating swallow...

32:18.240 --> 32:21.360
know the way south in winter?

32:21.400 --> 32:23.640
Or a spawning salmon...

32:23.720 --> 32:26.360
find the very source
of his birth...

32:26.440 --> 32:31.360
from the cold, black depth
of the mysterious sea?

32:31.440 --> 32:34.920
I know everything, Jack.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.280
Everything?

32:43.160 --> 32:47.040
Then why is it like this?
Why is there winter now?

32:49.840 --> 32:53.280
I'd be a powerful wizard,
indeed, could I answer.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.280
Suppose you tell me, Jack.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.280
Me?

32:58.840 --> 33:02.240
You know these woods
as well as any elf.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.560
Did you not see
something odd today?

33:12.640 --> 33:15.160
Any strange spirits?

33:15.240 --> 33:17.680
Did nothing untoward happen?

33:20.160 --> 33:22.120
No.

33:22.160 --> 33:28.000
No? No? Nothing?

33:28.080 --> 33:31.960
I did take Lily
to see the Unicorns.

33:32.040 --> 33:35.600
You did what?

33:35.680 --> 33:38.640
Silence!

33:43.320 --> 33:45.320
Oh, God, Gump, she touched him.

33:45.360 --> 33:49.240
Touched it? A mortal
laid hands on a Unicorn?

33:49.320 --> 33:53.160
Jack! Squawk, squawk,
no more talk!

33:55.520 --> 33:59.960
Do you think you can upset the order
of the universe and not pay the price?

34:00.040 --> 34:03.040
But she meant no wrong!

34:07.880 --> 34:10.639
What I did is done,
but I did it for love.

34:10.719 --> 34:14.080
Silence!

34:15.480 --> 34:20.440
Love, you say?
But answer me this riddle,

34:20.520 --> 34:22.600
and all will be forgiven.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.080
- And if I cannot?
- Why, Jack?

34:26.159 --> 34:29.199
Then 'tis your death song
I'll be playing.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.440
Then ask away...

34:35.520 --> 34:38.560
and pray God
my answer pleases you.

34:58.160 --> 35:00.840
What is a bell
that does not ring...

35:00.920 --> 35:03.880
yet its knell
makes the angels sing?

35:09.640 --> 35:12.480
Answer me this...

35:12.560 --> 35:15.360
and all will be forgiven.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.360
Flowers?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.960
Bluebells! To hear them ring
means your life is at an end!

35:39.040 --> 35:43.160
No!

35:52.720 --> 35:55.440
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

35:55.480 --> 35:58.000
Riddles! Riddles! Riddles!

35:58.080 --> 36:02.280
Damn it! Riddles!
Riddles! Riddles!

36:06.520 --> 36:08.440
Gump?

36:10.600 --> 36:12.520
Gump?

36:18.960 --> 36:21.920
Gump?

36:24.080 --> 36:26.840
You've bested me, Jack.

36:26.880 --> 36:30.120
Bested me, bested me.

36:30.200 --> 36:34.320
A riddle without an answer's like an
empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.

36:34.400 --> 36:39.000
Well spoken! And if it's wine
you want, it's wine we shall have.

36:39.080 --> 36:44.520
Brown Tom! A small measure
of entertainment at best.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.160
But, Gump, it's the last bottle
of me best wine.

36:48.200 --> 36:51.120
Oh-Oh, if you say so, sir.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.480
Now, Gump, don't you
be forgetting me.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.200
Oh, careful now.

37:06.280 --> 37:09.200
Oh, it's so precious.

37:09.240 --> 37:12.200
Elderberry wine.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.320
Sorry. No finer drink under heaven.

37:15.360 --> 37:17.720
Here's to Jack, Oh, brother.

37:17.800 --> 37:22.480
Riddle solver, dancing fool
and fairy friend.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.680
Tip it.

37:30.160 --> 37:34.200
Here, this'll help.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.520
Don't you care what's happened?

37:36.600 --> 37:40.240
Of course we care. What good's a
world locked in a season of death?

37:40.320 --> 37:42.840
But we must find the
answer. That we must.

37:42.920 --> 37:46.680
But first we must see that
no harm's come to the Unicorn.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.520
I sadly fear the worst.

38:33.600 --> 38:37.160
Wait.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.120
Lily!

38:47.760 --> 38:49.760
Jack, what?

39:40.520 --> 39:42.440
Jack!

41:24.520 --> 41:27.880
Forgive me.

41:32.480 --> 41:34.400
I meant no wrong.

42:20.120 --> 42:24.560
Well, Jack, tell us
what has happened.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.480
Come on, Jack.
Don't keep us in the dark.

42:38.560 --> 42:41.840
The dark is where we'll stay.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.840
We're cursed.

42:43.920 --> 42:47.560
Is there naught we can do?

42:47.640 --> 42:50.160
We must get the alicorn back.

42:51.640 --> 42:55.720
Only then will the world
return to normal.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.120
We must find a champion...

42:59.200 --> 43:02.400
bold of heart
and pure in spirit.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.360
Champion? What champion?

43:05.440 --> 43:08.680
Don't give up so quick, lads.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.040
You'll do.

43:12.760 --> 43:15.360
We must get you some weapons.

43:15.440 --> 43:17.960
But, Gump, I know
nothing of weapons.

43:18.040 --> 43:21.600
You'll learn. I know
where to find the best.

43:21.680 --> 43:25.520
Brown Tom, stay here with the
Unicorn and guard her well.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.400
Like me own life. Better.
She's the last of her kind.

43:42.040 --> 43:45.040
Magic horn is mine, mine, mine.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.520
Now all creatures
will love the night...

43:48.600 --> 43:51.040
and worship goblins as divine.

43:51.120 --> 43:53.880
You shouldn't
talk like that, Blix.

43:53.920 --> 43:57.360
Why not?
I've got the power now.

43:57.440 --> 44:00.640
Plenty big talk.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.120
Hah!

44:10.200 --> 44:14.200
Not even darkness
lasts forever.

44:20.080 --> 44:23.480
Jack, I can't go with you now.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.920
Anyway, Oona
will guide the way.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.760
Follow me, Jack.
Over here. Come on.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.320
Come on, Jack.

45:20.400 --> 45:24.600
Here, Jack. Come on.

45:54.480 --> 45:56.840
Oona.

45:58.240 --> 46:02.640
Nobody knows but you.
It's our secret, Jack.

46:02.680 --> 46:06.760
Don't tell Gump. Promise?

46:06.840 --> 46:09.160
Promise!

46:09.240 --> 46:12.440
I could be anything
you want me to be,

46:12.520 --> 46:15.440
even your heart's desire.

46:15.520 --> 46:18.600
You've got to help us, Jack.

46:18.680 --> 46:22.680
The fairies' love
makes anything possible.

46:32.160 --> 46:36.480
Higher, higher, burning fire.

46:36.520 --> 46:40.400
Making music like a choir.

46:40.480 --> 46:42.600
It seems a pity
to waste such power.

46:42.680 --> 46:46.480
Waste? Better watch out,
old pal Pox,

46:46.560 --> 46:49.480
or I'll turn you
into little pork chops.

46:49.560 --> 46:52.440
Why not turn everything
into garbage?

46:52.520 --> 46:55.360
A great towering
mountain of slop.

46:55.400 --> 46:58.560
Wouldn't that be magic?

46:58.640 --> 47:01.920
Higher, higher, burning fire.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.160
Making music like a choir.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.280
Blix, Blix. Blix!

47:13.320 --> 47:15.960
- What?
- Big D!

47:19.880 --> 47:22.000
Stop!

47:22.080 --> 47:24.960
Hear me, you angel of darkness!

47:25.040 --> 47:29.600
Your reign is over!
A new order begins!

47:29.680 --> 47:33.160
- I hold the power!
- Enough!

47:35.600 --> 47:40.840
Shit! Please!
It was only a joke.

47:40.880 --> 47:44.360
I didn't mean it.

47:44.440 --> 47:47.360
No! No!

47:47.440 --> 47:49.720
Have you no sense of humor?

47:49.760 --> 47:51.760
Adios, amigos!

47:58.040 --> 48:00.200
Forgive that intrusion,
great lord,

48:00.280 --> 48:03.480
but goblins are inclined
to be outspoken.

48:03.560 --> 48:05.680
Yeah. And I like to
encourage their initiative.

48:05.760 --> 48:09.040
Did you think
this a mere plaything?

48:09.120 --> 48:12.680
With it, my empire is eternal.

48:12.760 --> 48:15.360
Before I ruled only the night.

48:15.440 --> 48:20.880
Now my minions will frolic in
darkness until the end of time.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.520
The Unicorns are dead,
is this not true?

48:26.600 --> 48:30.400
True, lord, very plenty
true. Undeniably true.

48:30.480 --> 48:34.360
You lie! Here is dawn!

48:34.400 --> 48:37.200
It is essentially true.
On the other hand...

48:37.280 --> 48:40.640
Stallion is dead.
Dead as dreams.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.800
- Out with it!
- The mare lives still!

48:43.840 --> 48:48.040
If even one Unicorn walks the
earth, my power is not complete.

48:48.120 --> 48:51.080
She's just a female, lord.
She has no power.

48:51.120 --> 48:54.120
Only the power of creation.

48:54.160 --> 48:57.040
Get the mare!

48:57.120 --> 49:00.080
I command you!

49:03.560 --> 49:06.360
Well, let's see,
what have we here?

49:06.400 --> 49:10.640
A little sassafras.

49:10.720 --> 49:12.960
A little spearmint
would be nice,

49:13.040 --> 49:15.600
Some foxglove?

49:15.640 --> 49:19.640
And a little colt's foot.

49:21.720 --> 49:24.840
Hey, who goes there, what?

49:28.720 --> 49:31.440
I'm-I'm Princess Lily.

49:31.520 --> 49:34.600
You! You're the cause
of all our sorrow.

49:34.680 --> 49:38.560
I'm-I'm so sorry.

49:38.640 --> 49:44.160
I didn't know.
Please, please forgive me.

49:44.240 --> 49:47.400
- I'm not the one you should be askin'.
- Listen to me.

49:47.440 --> 49:51.800
Try and understand. I'm only
trying to make things right.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.800
Darkness has sent the goblins
back for the mare.

49:54.880 --> 49:59.280
It's not safe to stay here. You'll
have to hurry! Leave now! Go!

49:59.320 --> 50:02.120
Good lass. You're
a plucky little partridge.

50:02.200 --> 50:05.280
- Hurry! Aaah!
- Too late!

50:05.360 --> 50:08.720
You imps are lookin' for a fight,
you come to the chap who'll oblige ya.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.520
Try this on for size.

50:20.600 --> 50:23.520
You can't beat me.
Ha-ha, look at that!

50:23.600 --> 50:26.480
Keep 'em coming, fellas!

50:26.560 --> 50:31.480
Oh, check this out!
Yes, sir. You see?

50:31.520 --> 50:36.080
You just can't beat me!
You can't...

50:36.160 --> 50:40.680
Little tool is stuck.
They done for me.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.920
Quick!

50:58.200 --> 51:00.840
Wait for me!

51:05.120 --> 51:07.160
Brown Tom!

51:11.280 --> 51:15.520
Brown Tom, you can't be dead.

51:15.600 --> 51:18.080
This is terrible. Terrible!

51:18.160 --> 51:21.120
Brown Tom. Brown Tom.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.240
Gump?

51:23.320 --> 51:25.440
Screwball.

51:25.520 --> 51:28.040
Jack, lad.

51:28.120 --> 51:32.640
- They killed you too?
- Of course they didn't.

51:32.720 --> 51:36.520
- But what in blazes are you talking about?
- Goblins.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.960
- Goblins?
- Shot me through me brain pan.

51:42.480 --> 51:45.120
That's one spot an arrow
will do no harm.

51:45.200 --> 51:49.720
I did my best to fight 'em off,
but they swarmed up by the hundreds.

51:49.800 --> 51:54.640
All fierce creatures they were.
The princess warned me, but...

51:54.720 --> 51:56.720
- Lily?
- Aye.

51:56.800 --> 51:58.720
Then she's alive!

51:58.800 --> 52:01.720
She was alive still
when they killed me.

52:01.800 --> 52:04.400
The goblins
must have taken her.

52:04.480 --> 52:05.920
We follow their tracks
in the snow.

52:11.520 --> 52:13.800
The Great Tree.

52:13.880 --> 52:17.120
When evil anarchy
ruled the land,

52:17.160 --> 52:20.400
the wicked came here
to sacrifice.

52:53.680 --> 52:57.320
Ugly. I hate it.

52:57.360 --> 53:00.000
Good. You go first.

53:00.080 --> 53:02.600
Why always me?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.240
Go!

53:08.480 --> 53:11.480
Foreigner.

53:11.560 --> 53:16.040
Slippery.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.880
Oh, okay, okay.

53:38.920 --> 53:41.080
I made it!

53:41.160 --> 53:44.080
Screwball!

53:56.240 --> 53:58.840
Foul-tasting fairy!

54:04.080 --> 54:07.440
Come to Meg, juicy boy.

54:12.560 --> 54:16.440
Who be this tender morsel...

54:16.520 --> 54:21.280
disturbing
Meg Mucklebone's rest?

54:21.360 --> 54:25.440
Jack. They call me Jack, ma'am.

54:28.520 --> 54:32.800
And what a fine,
fat boy you are, Jack.

54:32.880 --> 54:35.200
You don't really mean
to eat me, do you, ma'am?

54:35.280 --> 54:38.720
Oh, indeed I do!

54:40.800 --> 54:44.320
But that would be a shame,
because someone as fair...

54:44.400 --> 54:48.640
and lovely as yourself, Miss Meg,
deserves far better than scrawny me.

54:51.120 --> 54:53.720
Don't you think?

54:53.800 --> 54:59.440
You think me fair,
do you, Jack?

54:59.520 --> 55:03.560
All the heavenly angels
must envy your beauty.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.400
What a fine meal you'll make,

55:14.480 --> 55:18.560
be the rest of you
as sweet as your tongue.

55:18.640 --> 55:20.640
Wait! No!

55:20.720 --> 55:24.960
Your Loveliness, feast on
the beauty of your reflection.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.520
You are an angel, Miss Meg.

55:28.600 --> 55:31.960
Look. Look.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.680
What a splendid idea.

55:40.160 --> 55:42.120
Clever boy!

55:42.160 --> 55:46.360
Yes.

55:46.400 --> 55:50.680
Your alchemy makes
crusted steel shine like silver.

55:51.960 --> 55:54.040
That's discerning taste...

55:54.120 --> 55:57.160
for one so young, Jack.

56:03.600 --> 56:07.040
Come. Come, Jack!

56:07.120 --> 56:10.160
Give us a kiss...
before dining!

56:26.760 --> 56:29.360
I did it!

57:48.560 --> 57:50.520
Screwball!

57:57.960 --> 58:00.920
Oh, okay. Okay.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.800
Oh! Whee! Look.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.440
What a big trumpet!
I'll bet it makes a lot of noise.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.240
Our lives are lost if it blows.

58:36.160 --> 58:38.520
I think it stopped.

58:43.640 --> 58:45.880
Look out!

58:54.760 --> 58:57.080
My back! Me achin' back!

58:57.120 --> 59:01.000
Oh, I'm not as old
as I used to be, you know.

59:03.360 --> 59:07.440
Hey, where are we?

59:07.520 --> 59:10.440
Someplace we don't want to be.

59:13.960 --> 59:17.360
Hey, hey! Wait for me!

59:17.440 --> 59:21.240
We gotta get out of here!
It's the stench of hell itself!

59:23.280 --> 59:26.080
Quiet!

59:26.160 --> 59:30.480
You'll be fricasseed fairies
if you don't keep quiet.

59:30.560 --> 59:32.800
Who be you, bucket head?

59:32.880 --> 59:36.160
Who I am won't help me
nor you, neither,

59:36.240 --> 59:39.560
even though
we are all brothers.

59:43.200 --> 59:45.720
What happened to you?

59:45.800 --> 59:47.720
It's a long story.

59:47.800 --> 59:50.920
Let's just say
I went looking for adventure...

59:51.000 --> 59:54.040
and found
more than I could handle.

59:54.120 --> 59:57.760
Doesn't matter now anyway.

59:57.840 --> 01:00:01.080
We are all in the same fix!

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:06.160
I knew it. I knew it.
I should have stayed at home.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.600
Let's face it, brothers.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:13.720
Me and you all... is barbecue.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.280
Barbecue?
That's right. Barbecue.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.240
Only dead meat waits
for the stew pot.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.760
Spring the lock
with your magic, Gump.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:46.000
Iron is trouble for elves.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.000
Iron?

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.080
Oh, no!

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.080
The thing!

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.720
Oh, no! He's coming! Hide!

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.240
Hide! Hide! Hide!

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:28.000
I don't think I can handle it!
Help me!

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.400
Let me go! Let me go!

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.680
Help! Help me!

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.040
Please! Please!

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.520
Help me!

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:18.280
Oh, you beast! Help me!

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.440
Let me go!

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:41.160
Gump, we've got to help him.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.160
Oh, don't worry. Our brother
can take care of himself.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.200
I'm sure of it, I think.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.920
Screwball's right. It's more
important that you find the Unicorn.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.440
Why not have Oona fly out,
find a key?

01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.960
Oona? But she's much too small.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Could never lift it.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:03.720
Our secret!

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.440
Our secret will keep forever
in this grave if you don't help us.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:09.600
You promised!

01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.760
You willful sprite.
How dare you keep such secrets?

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:16.160
They're mine to keep.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:26.520
I'll do what you ask...
if you'll kiss me, Jack.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.960
Easy enough.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.800
You call that a kiss?
Am I not sweet?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.960
Sweeter than bee pollen...

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.000
on a summer wind.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.160
Sweet as the wind
that blows me to you.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.400
Oh, it's fairy magic.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.000
Lily?

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.520
- Lily?
- Yes, Jack.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.240
This isn't real.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.080
Oh, it is.

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:33.040
I'm warm and alive...

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.560
and want to be in your arms.

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:02.080
No, I, I can't. No.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.560
This is just
more fairy glamour.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.440
Human hearts
don't work that way.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.040
What care I for human hearts?

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.160
Soft and spiritless
as porridge!

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.880
A fairy's heart beats
fierce and free!

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:30.360
Oona!

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:34.680
Your fine sensibilities
have left us here to rot!

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.520
I'm behind you all the way, Gump.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.680
You look like mourners
at your own funeral.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.200
Oona!

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.680
Quick, lads!

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.680
You!

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.280
You mortal, you!

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:17.120
I could vex you!
Dance your life away!

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.840
I'll stay here and...

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.720
Wait for me!

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.760
A terrible sight
for a sober man.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.120
We must find the dungeons.

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.120
I think I'll stay right here,
thank you very much.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:18.120
You'll search
with the rest of us.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.640
Then I'll go with Jack.
No! We split up.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.160
Yes! It's better
if we go in teams.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.960
No, I will go with Ja...

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.400
Gump and me,
Brown Tom and Screwball.

01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:30.400
Right. Let's synchronize.

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:41.960
Oh! A-ha!

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:46.960
We meet back here in twice
500 beats of a bluebird's heart.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.320
Do you know what I think? I think we should
add a couple more hundred breaths of a...

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.760
Take care. Come on, Jack.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.800
Be careful.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.760
There's only one thing
I want to know. What?

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.200
Why me?

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:15.840
I think we should go west.
I think we should go east.

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:17.840
Oh, okay. Wait!

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:24.840
Father, I hold the world
in my grasp,

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:30.319
and yet this girl...
distracts me.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:34.600
It has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.160
What am I to do?

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.840
She fascinates you
because her soul is pure.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.800
- I'll take her then.
- Fool!

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.720
You must woo her!

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:56.600
She remembers the world
as it was,

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.760
so... tempt her.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.000
Win her.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.120
Make her one of us.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.399
Hey.

01:09:27.479 --> 01:09:29.399
Did, did you see something?

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.600
- No, did you?
- I don't know.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.600
I think.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.120
D- D-D-Did you hear that?

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.120
What's that?

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.120
That's a horse, you idiot.

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:35.080
Woo her.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.200
Win her.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.840
Woo her, win her.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:00.720
Make her one of us.

01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:23.320
Lady, do not be afraid.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.640
Quiet, quiet.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:33.480
How like you my gifts?

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:37.240
Does the gown not please you?

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.400
No.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:47.880
Can you speak so
of your bridal gown?

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.480
I've found my true mate,

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.080
and you know it.

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:58.760
- Never.
- Beneath the skin, we are already one.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.280
Was it not your sin
trapped the Unicorn?

01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:07.040
- No.
- Even now...

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.800
the evil seed
of what you have done...

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.280
germinates within you.

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.440
No. You lie.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:19.040
You disgust me.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.040
You're nothing but an animal.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.520
We are all animals, my lady.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.960
Most are too afraid to see it.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.480
- Lily!
- Jack.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:54.120
There's nothing
you can do now to help her.

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.800
Be thankful she still lives.

01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.800
You've got to help us, Jack.

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.960
The last Unicorn dies tonight.

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.560
- As her blood ebbs,
- Never.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.800
The sun sets forever.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:16.280
There shall never be
another dawn.

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:18.600
No!

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.160
Lady, I require the solace
of the shadows...

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:28.160
and the dark of the night.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:32.680
Sunshine is my destroyer!

01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.520
Damn you!

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.720
We are all of us damned,
my queen.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.720
As long as the sun still shines,

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:54.800
we can destroy him.

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:57.560
Let me dazzle you
with my wisdom.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.040
I think I know a way.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:10.160
Come on, come on, come on.
You're holding us up.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:13.440
Listen. We're not going down
the same corridor umpteen times.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.840
I think we should go that way.
No, we're going this way.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.840
No, not me.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:25.480
Let's go down there.
Stay close to me now.

01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:43.600
- You know what?
- What?

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.720
I vote we run like hell.
I second the motion.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.560
Screwball.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.280
Where were you?

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:01.640
In another three flicks of a
badger's tail, we would have gone.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.400
While you're having fun,
time goes by fast.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.240
Yeah, we found the mare,
and it's alive in the dungeon.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.280
Excellent. Excellent, you two!

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.560
Thank you very much.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:15.480
Now Jack has a plan,
and a good one!

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:18.960
We must gather every
shining object we can find.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.800
We're going to bring light
to darkness.

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.480
Blunder.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.720
Blunder!

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.720
Any more noise,
and you're shish kebab.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.480
You do what we say, understand?
Swear it.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:32.360
I swear it on the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:36.240
Please, help. Help me.

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:40.880
Thank you.

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.200
Judge me not so harshly,
mistress.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.360
I invite you
to share this supper.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.680
Look how sweet it is.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:00.720
Hurry, hurry. Keep 'em
comin'! Come on, come on!

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
- Brown Tom!
- Huh?

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.640
Gump? Gump!

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.440
- Gump?
- Jack. Jack!

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.680
Three cheers for our champion!

01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.120
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.440
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.240
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.000
Now what, Jack?

01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:02.160
Must go all the way out.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.840
Light.

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.960
Not much to hold on to.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:14.200
Take a pea pod pixie
to make that climb.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:22.640
I'll do it.

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:28.040
What's the matter? Ain't
I small enough for the job?

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.480
No job is too small
for my little brother.

01:27:31.560 --> 01:27:35.480
Please, Gump. Let me try.
I won't let you down.

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.720
All right, all right.
Do it, but be swift!

01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:43.320
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You'll never regret it.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:47.400
I always knew you'd be
going places, Screwball. Yes.

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.120
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.960
You lie.

01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:04.040
Just to please me.

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.600
I do nothing for your pleasure.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:12.440
All I wish...

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:16.640
is for you to sit
and talk with me.

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:19.080
Sit?

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.640
- Here?
- Yes.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.640
Please.

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.320
- I prefer to stand.
- Sit!

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.720
Or stand. As you wish.

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.400
It is enough that
we are alone together.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.080
Just the two of us.

01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:54.240
Some... simple conversation.

01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:58.160
I have nothing to talk about.

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:02.480
You've stolen my dreams away.

01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:04.640
All things change, Lady.

01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:09.080
The dreams of youth...

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.320
are the regrets of maturity.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.160
Dreams are my specialty.

01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:22.160
Through dreams
I influence mankind.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.320
My dream...

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:28.840
is of eternity with you.

01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.040
I offer you this rose,
Princess...

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.800
my heart,

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:43.800
my soul,

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.920
my love.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.160
Love?

01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:08.320
Once I was content
with solitude...

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.960
until that moment...

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.800
I felt your vivid presence.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.080
A little to the right.

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:21.000
Left. Good!

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:27.600
It grows late. Sit.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:30.680
I value your thoughts.

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.400
Share them with me.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:15.640
- Sit?
- Yes.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.560
- Nothing more than that?
- And talk with me.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.840
I think I'll stand,
if you don't mind.

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:37.960
Damn you!

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:41.240
No! Never! Never!

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.240
I hear a throat
begging to be cut.

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:15.080
Are you so... anxious...

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.120
to see blood flow?

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.400
As you are to drink it. Grant
your bride one wish on this night.

01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:23.400
You have but to ask.

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.760
I will stay here with you
as you wish.

01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.640
- But on one condition.
- Anything.

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:36.600
I want to kill the Unicorn.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:58.120
I can't let that happen.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.120
In the beginning...

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.840
there was nothing...

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:19.360
a void of darkness,

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:23.680
a cold eternity of silence.

01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:29.520
Jack, your greatest challenge
is still to come.

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.400
And we have not much time.

01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:45.320
When the perfect void
was corrupted...

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.320
by light,

01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:50.560
a great wailing was heard,

01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:55.320
and all the brethren fled
in terror.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.120
Gump!

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:00.440
Oona, fly up like the wind.

01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:02.440
It's time.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.760
Jack!

01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:17.480
- Lily.
- Jack.

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:20.760
Judge her with your heart,

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.920
not your eyes.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.440
Hear me,

01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:29.440
ye powers of the night!

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:33.280
We offer this sacrifice,

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.040
in honor of you,

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.080
sanctified with blood...

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:46.160
and with fire!

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:00.160
I pray you, Father,

01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:02.880
accept my sacrifice.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.880
Let light
be forever extinguished.

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:14.320
Let the age of darkness begin!

01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.880
Come, Lady.

01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.720
The birth of a new world
awaits your stroke.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.520
Let my offering be made
of flesh and blood.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:32.680
She means to do it, Jack.
She's one of them.

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:35.200
I am sister to the Fates.

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:38.320
Kill her. Forget her.

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.680
Think about the Unicorn.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.200
- Do it!
- Lily.

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.720
- I'll do it.
- No! No.

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:03.800
I trust you, Lily.

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:06.240
I'll always trust you.

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:11.640
Run!

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:14.800
Run! You're free!

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.480
Darkness!

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:50.520
What have we here?

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.040
A little boy.

01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.120
Screwball! Screwball, wake up!

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.920
Wake up, Screwball! Wake up!

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.160
It's always a pleasure
to take a brave man's life.

01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:50.040
Wake up!

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.520
Don't you know me, boy?

01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:45.080
- Quickly!
- What time is it?

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:49.160
Every wolf suffers fleas.

01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:52.040
'Tis easy enough to scratch.

01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:09.760
Give it to me, boy!

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.560
Father!

01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:36.680
Protect me!

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:50.760
You think you have won!

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:55.320
What is light...

01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.320
without dark?

01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:01.040
What are you...

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:04.360
without me?

01:41:07.560 --> 01:41:11.160
I am a part of you all.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:15.920
You can never defeat me.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.360
We are brothers...

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:20.160
eternal!

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.000
Do it, Jack! Kill him!

01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:25.360
Kill him!

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.640
She's under a spell.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:13.200
A powerful spell.

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.400
Do something.

01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.240
Look what we've been through.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.320
Look who you are.

01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:27.600
Have faith in yourself.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.360
It is the greatest lesson
you have learned.

01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:33.760
Only you
can answer this riddle.

01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:38.080
I'm a princess.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.760
It's my right to set
a challenge for my suitors.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.600
I will marry...
whoever finds this ring.

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:51.600
We too have a promise to keep.

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.280
Now fulfill your promise.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.760
I will miss you.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:02.840
- But don't forget us.
- Never.

01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:01.040
I love you, Lily.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:04.520
Come back to me.

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.000
Come back to me.

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:22.000
I... love you, Jack.

01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:41.120
I love you, Lily.

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.920
I had such a terrible
nightmare.

01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:47.440
Did you?

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.200
It's over.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.800
Jack, was it all a dream?

01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:12.600
You're safe now.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.120
So many terrible things
happened.

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:22.560
I...

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:27.040
I learned something
about myself...

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:29.320
and something about you.

01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:31.680
What's that?

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:34.680
You belong here.

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:37.280
You're my prince.

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:42.040
I'm only Jack.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:44.560
My Lord Jack.

01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.280
So you take that...

01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.800
and you keep it, treasure it.

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:33.680
It's part of me.

01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:41.160
Can I come tomorrow?

01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:43.160
Of course.

01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:47.160
I'll be here.

01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:49.640
I'll always be here
for you, Lily.

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.360
Will you sing for me?

01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:04.360
Come down, sparrow

01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.720
Sing me good morning

01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.080
Rise up, sun
like the arch of the sky

01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.200
Living river

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.800
Turn light to diamonds

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:19.480
When I look
in my true love's eyes

01:48:20.305 --> 01:48:26.664
