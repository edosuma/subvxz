WEBVTT

00:01.238 --> 00:08.365
...test facing any captain, any crew, is the loss of a shipmate.

00:08.365 --> 00:11.835
We've come here to honor one of our own.

00:11.835 --> 00:17.983
In the time we knew him, he showed us just how much one life can truly matter.

00:17.983 --> 00:23.662
We will never forget what he did for us and for the ship he loved so much.

00:23.662 --> 00:27.947
We will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission,

00:27.947 --> 00:33.243
so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on this ship,

00:33.243 --> 00:36.164
but for all the citizens of Earth.

00:40.827 --> 00:45.223
It's been a long road

00:45.223 --> 00:48.409
Getting from there to here

00:48.409 --> 00:52.349
It's been a long time

00:52.349 --> 00:56.267
But my time is finally near

00:56.267 --> 01:00.484
And I will see my dream come alive at last

01:00.484 --> 01:04.183
I will touch the sky

01:04.183 --> 01:07.843
And they're not gonna hold me down no more

01:07.843 --> 01:11.091
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:11.091 --> 01:15.786
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:15.786 --> 01:18.710
I'm going where the heart will take me

01:18.710 --> 01:23.764
I've got faith to believe

01:23.764 --> 01:26.480
I can do anything

01:26.480 --> 01:31.283
I've got strength of the soul

01:31.283 --> 01:34.254
No one's gonna bend or break me

01:34.254 --> 01:40.159
I can reach any star

01:40.159 --> 01:43.861
I've got faith

01:43.861 --> 01:47.915
I've got faith

01:47.915 --> 01:50.831
Faith of the heart

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074

02:00.239 --> 02:03.117
062 [3x10] Similitude

02:05.486 --> 02:11.218
We just re-route the system taps...
compress the antimatter stream before it reaches the injectors.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.281
That will stabilize the warp field?

02:13.281 --> 02:16.694
Every simulation I run comes back with the same result.

02:16.694 --> 02:20.774
We'll be able to cruise at warp 5.0
with no field fluctuation.

02:20.774 --> 02:26.276
I'm talking about a ride so smooth you can build a house of cards on the warp reactor.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.797
If we can maintain high warp for extended periods,

02:28.797 --> 02:30.830
we can cover the Expanse more quickly.

02:30.830 --> 02:35.372
Which boosts our chances of finding the Xindi weapon in time.

02:36.977 --> 02:39.696
- To the left.
- Oh, sorry.

02:41.246 --> 02:45.677
You get me talking about the engines and I forget where I am.

02:45.677 --> 02:49.739
Don't know what it is about fine-tuning a piece of machinery.

02:49.739 --> 02:52.153
Lie on your back.

02:55.677 --> 03:00.182
You know... you made this sound
a whole lot worse than it is.

03:00.182 --> 03:03.065
Advanced neuro-pressure can place great demands on the body.

03:03.065 --> 03:06.838
I have to say, so far, it's a piece of cake.

03:06.838 --> 03:12.095
We haven't gotten to the more challenging postures.

03:13.464 --> 03:15.157
Well.

03:16.233 --> 03:18.915
I'm always up for a challenge.

03:18.915 --> 03:20.473
Breathe.

03:28.254 --> 03:30.630
Tucker to the bridge.

03:30.630 --> 03:33.255
Archer.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.364
We're all set down here.

03:35.364 --> 03:39.485
I'll need at least 4.9 to get the plasma hot enough to compress the stream.

03:39.485 --> 03:43.011
- You heard the man, Travis. 4.9.
- Aye, sir.

03:54.548 --> 03:57.306
4.5...

03:57.306 --> 04:00.978
4.6...

04:00.978 --> 04:04.668
4.7...

04:04.668 --> 04:08.148
4.8...

04:11.634 --> 04:15.186
The warp field is fluctuating.

04:16.735 --> 04:18.901
4.9...

04:18.901 --> 04:21.831
Initializing stream compression.

04:26.635 --> 04:30.684
Damn.... that's a beautiful sound.

04:30.684 --> 04:33.834
Field fluctuations have dropped to zero.

04:33.834 --> 04:37.366
I think we just got our second wind.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.070
Something's flooding the intake manifolds.

04:46.070 --> 04:46.997
Drop to impulse!

04:46.997 --> 04:49.645
- I've lost helm control...
- Trip! Status?

04:49.645 --> 04:54.063
I've got a primary injector flare!
I'm shutting down!

04:56.983 --> 05:00.507
It's not responding, Captain!

05:11.721 --> 05:15.533
The flare's causing a system-wide overload.

05:40.176 --> 05:43.414
Fires reported on B and C Deck.
emergency crews en route.

05:43.414 --> 05:45.367
Helm control is still down.

05:45.367 --> 05:46.445
Analysis.

05:46.445 --> 05:50.617
Some kind of polaric field, approximately 11,000 kilometers in diameter.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.062
Composition unknown.

05:52.062 --> 05:54.754
I'll need more time to complete a detailed scan.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.588
Is that what stopped us?

05:56.588 --> 05:59.469
It's a logical conclusion.

05:59.469 --> 06:00.741
Keep scanning.

06:00.741 --> 06:02.420
Numerous injuries throughout the ship.

06:02.420 --> 06:05.702
Mostly minor, except for one.

06:05.702 --> 06:09.029
Commander Tucker. He's been taken to Sick Bay.

06:18.933 --> 06:21.112
Report.

06:21.112 --> 06:26.112
When we entered the field, nucleonic particles flooded the manifolds, causing the injector flare.

06:26.112 --> 06:31.506
If Commander Tucker hadn't shut down the reactor, we could've had a breach.

06:31.506 --> 06:33.825
How much time before we can get the engines back on line?

06:33.825 --> 06:35.744
We're still running diagnostics.

06:35.744 --> 06:38.857
The damage is significant.
It could take weeks.

06:38.857 --> 06:43.415
Commander Tucker's going to have his hands full.

06:44.512 --> 06:47.340
You'll be supervising the repairs.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.204
I've just come from Sick Bay.
Trip's in a coma.

06:51.204 --> 06:54.416
He has extensive neural damage.

06:54.416 --> 06:59.729
Dr. Phlox says we have prepare
for the possibility that Trip won't survive.

07:12.161 --> 07:13.452
How is he?

07:13.452 --> 07:16.208
His condition's unchanged.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.814
I'd like to show you something.

07:18.814 --> 07:23.696
This is one of the more interesting members of my little menagerie.

07:23.696 --> 07:26.921
A Lyssarian Desevae.

07:26.921 --> 07:31.931
Its epidermal layer secretes a viral suppressant that I use as a salve for cuts and bruises.

07:31.931 --> 07:34.501
How does this relate to Trip?

07:34.501 --> 07:38.848
The larvae had another, somewhat more controversial property.

07:38.848 --> 07:41.250
When implanted with DNA from another species,

07:41.250 --> 07:46.965
it exactly replicates that species' life cycle,
albeit at a rapidly accelerated rate.

07:46.965 --> 07:48.273
It becomes a clone.

07:48.273 --> 07:53.310
Essentially, but one that is born, grows old and dies in approximately 15 days.

07:53.310 --> 07:56.279
The Lyssarians call them "Mimetic Simbiots."

07:56.279 --> 08:00.917
They are a closely guarded secret.
Very few people know of their existence.

08:00.917 --> 08:04.540
And you want to do this with Trip.

08:04.540 --> 08:06.997
Use his DNA to grow a simbiot?

08:06.997 --> 08:12.263
To harvest its neural tissue for a transplant.

08:16.498 --> 08:20.851
There's no guarantee that human DNA will stimulate the larvae's growth cycle.

08:20.851 --> 08:28.468
But as it stands now, it may be Commander Tucker's only hope for survival.

08:28.468 --> 08:30.611
To ensure the tissue's compatibility, I'll have to wait

08:30.611 --> 08:34.616
until the simbiot reaches Commander Tucker's present physical age.

08:34.616 --> 08:40.740
Then, I can excise the tissue from a non-critical region of the simbiot's cerebrum.

08:40.740 --> 08:47.176
It would experience no discernible side effects,
and should be able to live out its normal life span.

08:47.176 --> 08:49.741
Its 15-day life span.

08:49.741 --> 08:56.287
I don't make this proposal lightly, Captain,
but I'm obligated to provide you with all available options.

09:03.141 --> 09:05.046
Come in.

09:05.046 --> 09:06.755
We sent out an EV team.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.384
They retrieved a sample of the substance accumulating on the hull.

09:10.384 --> 09:15.974
Multiple hits with a plasma-rifle were required to dislodge it.

09:18.351 --> 09:21.046
It's composed of highly-charged particles.

09:21.046 --> 09:22.959
Mostly ferric ions.

09:22.959 --> 09:26.965
But there are several elements that we can't identify.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.496
And it's highly magnetic.

09:32.496 --> 09:35.493
So far, the danger to the ship seems negligible.

09:35.493 --> 09:42.716
But the longer we remain in the field, the more these particles build up.

09:42.716 --> 09:46.257
Do whatever you have to do.

09:46.257 --> 09:48.303
But we need to get those engines back on line.

09:48.303 --> 09:50.557
Understood.

09:53.761 --> 09:58.111
Regarding the Lyssarian procedure Doctor Phlox proposed.

09:58.111 --> 10:00.991
May I ask if you've reached a decision?

10:00.991 --> 10:03.295
I approved it.

10:03.295 --> 10:07.256
Are you aware that the Lyssarian Prime Conclave has banned the creation of simbiots?

10:07.256 --> 10:11.070
We don't answer to the Lyssarian Prime Conclave.

10:11.070 --> 10:14.906
Simbiots are living, conscious entities.

10:14.906 --> 10:18.621
We'll be growing a sentient being for the sole purpose of harvesting tissue.

10:18.621 --> 10:22.624
I'm aware of the ethical implications.

10:22.624 --> 10:26.801
If we weren't in the Expanse, maybe my decision would be different.

10:26.801 --> 10:31.613
But... we've got to complete this mission.

10:31.613 --> 10:34.296
Earth needs Enterprise.

10:34.296 --> 10:37.317
Enterprise needs Trip.

10:40.151 --> 10:42.595
It's as simple as that.

11:14.239 --> 11:16.320
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

11:16.320 --> 11:21.458
The engines are still down, and the nucleonic particles
continue to build up on the hull.

11:21.458 --> 11:26.772
It's been two days since Doctor Phlox
initiated the procedure to grow the simbiot.

11:26.772 --> 11:31.053
He's rather sensitive to light at this stage.

11:31.053 --> 11:38.627
By tomorrow morning, if all goes well, we'll have a healthy baby boy on our hands.

11:52.669 --> 11:57.778
A perfect genetic duplicate, right down to the birthmark on his right side.

11:57.778 --> 11:59.487
He certainly sounds healthy.

11:59.487 --> 12:00.411
And hungry.

12:00.411 --> 12:02.596
Excuse me...

12:06.354 --> 12:13.662
Oh, it's been some time since I've handled a newborn.

12:17.689 --> 12:20.971
But I see I haven't lost my touch.

12:20.971 --> 12:25.380
Three days ago, he was just another one of your creatures...

12:25.380 --> 12:28.042
something you kept on a shelf.

12:28.042 --> 12:31.433
He's certainly come a long way in a short while.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.799
In a short while, he'll be a lot older.

12:33.799 --> 12:35.719
Have you thought of where he's going to live?

12:35.719 --> 12:37.292
Why not right here?

12:37.292 --> 12:40.935
I can't think of a more stimulating environment for a developing young mind,

12:40.935 --> 12:45.290
and I'll be able to keep a close watch on his development.

12:45.290 --> 12:48.307
Sounds like you've found yourself a new roommate.

12:48.307 --> 12:50.862
Now, all I need to do is find him a name.

12:50.862 --> 12:54.601
The crew has been offering suggestions, but nothing sounds right.

12:54.601 --> 12:59.583
Steven, Enrique, Dennis? Dennis?

12:59.583 --> 13:01.976
You see my dilemma.

13:02.966 --> 13:05.383
I'm sure you'll think of something.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.706
Chief Medical Officer's Log.

13:09.706 --> 13:15.288
After much deliberation, I have finally thought of a name for this newest addition to our crew...

13:15.288 --> 13:16.925
It's all right, Sim.

13:16.925 --> 13:18.861
It's all right.

13:18.861 --> 13:21.564
Lucky for me, Denobulans require very little sleep.

13:21.564 --> 13:25.520
I'm at a loss to understand how human adults endure the REM cycle interruptions

13:25.520 --> 13:27.951
that accompany the teething stage.

13:27.951 --> 13:33.241
Though I knew what to expect, I can't help but be astonished by Sim's rapid physical development.

13:33.241 --> 13:39.406
A side note... I may have stumbled across an effective fertilizer for my Orsic fern.

13:39.406 --> 13:43.068
"Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely

13:43.068 --> 13:49.269
imagine the strange horror of its... appear... appearance..."

13:49.269 --> 13:51.150
That's very good.

13:51.150 --> 13:55.701
Can we just skip to the part where the Martian machines attack?

13:55.701 --> 13:56.922
We just showed you this book.

13:56.922 --> 13:59.141
How do you know about the Martian machines?

13:59.141 --> 14:01.068
My mom read it to me.

14:01.068 --> 14:02.136
Your mom?

14:02.136 --> 14:05.529
Uh, huh... I think it's Chapter Ten.

14:05.529 --> 14:08.823
It's become quite evident that Sim's remarkable scholastic progress goes

14:08.823 --> 14:12.232
far beyond an aptitude for learning.

14:12.232 --> 14:15.641
He's remembering things that happened to Trip when Trip was this age.

14:15.641 --> 14:19.936
So, the older he grows, the more of Trip's life he'll recall.

14:19.936 --> 14:24.696
There are some species that rely solely on genetic seque to pass on their cultural memories.

14:24.696 --> 14:26.513
Evidently, humans have a similar capacity.

14:26.513 --> 14:29.516
This could be an important discovery.

14:29.516 --> 14:32.194
He certainly possesses Commander Tucker's curiosity.

14:32.194 --> 14:36.056
This morning, he took apart my medical tricorder.

14:36.056 --> 14:37.811
He's starting to look like Trip.

14:37.811 --> 14:39.975
And he's beginning to ask questions.

14:39.975 --> 14:41.218
"Where did I come from?"

14:41.218 --> 14:42.979
"Where's my mother and father?"

14:42.979 --> 14:45.606
"Why am I here?"

14:45.606 --> 14:50.663
It's only been three days and he's already beginning to realize how different he is.

14:50.663 --> 14:54.696
He's going to have to be told the truth... soon.

14:56.836 --> 15:00.584
I gave the order that created him.

15:00.584 --> 15:03.780
I should be the one to explain why.

15:09.002 --> 15:12.491
There's nothing Porthos likes more than dinner time.

15:15.287 --> 15:16.973
Can he do any tricks?

15:16.973 --> 15:19.300
I haven't taught him any.

15:19.300 --> 15:25.494
Mostly what he does is eat, sleep, and, uh, and not fetch.

15:25.494 --> 15:27.782
Just fill it up halfway.

15:31.183 --> 15:33.101
I used to have a dog.

15:33.101 --> 15:35.457
His name was Bedford.

15:35.457 --> 15:38.943
He was so big, I could ride him like a horse.

15:38.943 --> 15:41.693
Is that right?

15:41.693 --> 15:44.783
That's Zefram Cochrane.

15:45.630 --> 15:48.503
He invented warp drive.

15:48.503 --> 15:49.714
That's right, he did.

15:49.714 --> 15:53.687
Doctor Phlox says your dad helped design the Warp V engine.

15:53.687 --> 15:57.708
That's a picture of him right there.

15:57.708 --> 16:02.484
And this is me on my first day of flight school.

16:02.484 --> 16:05.082
Did you always want to be a starship captain?

16:05.082 --> 16:06.803
As long as I can remember.

16:06.803 --> 16:08.525
Why?

16:08.525 --> 16:10.733
It's what I was meant to do.

16:10.733 --> 16:13.482
Bet it's a fun job.

16:13.482 --> 16:16.596
It has its moments.

16:17.725 --> 16:20.104
Let me show you something.

16:21.152 --> 16:23.622
Keep the nose up.

16:24.111 --> 16:27.723
That's right.

16:27.723 --> 16:29.349
It pulls a little to the left...

16:29.349 --> 16:32.772
Trim the port aileron.

16:32.772 --> 16:36.834
That feels better...

16:36.834 --> 16:39.762
My dad says I should be an engineer.

16:39.762 --> 16:42.442
My mom thinks I should study architecture.

16:42.442 --> 16:44.150
But I want to do what you do.

16:44.150 --> 16:47.068
Be a starship captain.

16:50.993 --> 16:52.680
You know what's weird?

16:52.680 --> 16:54.132
What?

16:54.132 --> 17:00.014
My parents call me "Trip," but everyone here  calls me "Sim."

17:01.922 --> 17:06.303
Where's my mom and dad?

17:06.303 --> 17:09.422
Are they back on Earth?

17:09.422 --> 17:13.109
That's a little difficult to answer.

17:31.364 --> 17:32.946
It's broken.

17:32.946 --> 17:35.692
Nothing a little glue won't remedy.

17:35.692 --> 17:40.645
I crashed it plenty of times myself.

17:40.645 --> 17:43.286
I miss my parents.

17:46.656 --> 17:48.453
Come with me.

17:56.005 --> 17:58.004
Doctor Phlox says I'm not allowed to go in there.

17:58.004 --> 17:59.851
It's okay.

18:21.978 --> 18:24.913
He's Trip.

18:24.913 --> 18:27.986
That's right.

18:27.986 --> 18:35.582
My parents... they're not really mine... they're his?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.968
Yes.

18:37.968 --> 18:53.667
So... that time I put a garden snake in Lizzie's dollhouse... that wasn't me.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.096
No.

18:56.096 --> 19:00.402
So, I'm just some kind of copy of him?

19:00.402 --> 19:06.245
You're more than that, Sim.

19:07.898 --> 19:13.388
You have Trip's memories,
but you also have your own memories,

19:13.388 --> 19:16.281
the one's you're making here...
on Enterprise.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.348
How long have I lived here?

19:18.348 --> 19:22.529
You were born only four days ago.

19:22.529 --> 19:23.895
I feel older.

19:23.895 --> 19:26.556
It's hard to understand, I know.

19:26.556 --> 19:34.584
There's a part of you... something inside you... that Trip needs.

19:34.584 --> 19:39.064
Doctor Phlox is going to have to perform an operation.

19:39.064 --> 19:40.967
- Will it hurt?
- Not at all.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.851
You won't feel a thing.

19:42.851 --> 19:44.523
Doctors always say that.

19:44.523 --> 19:47.211
When Phlox says it, it's the truth.

19:51.180 --> 19:54.583
Can we go fix the model now?

19:54.583 --> 19:56.841
Sure.

20:06.925 --> 20:08.959
Captain's Starlog, Supplemental.

20:08.959 --> 20:13.380
Enterprise has been incapacitated for seven days, and during that time,

20:13.380 --> 20:16.519
Sim has practically become a member of the crew.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.399
I've assigned him to engineering, where he's been assisting T'Pol

20:19.399 --> 20:23.211
in the ongoing effort to repair the engines.

20:32.533 --> 20:36.109
Waveguides... for the primary port bypass.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.551
Think I made some progress.

20:38.551 --> 20:42.452
This looks promising.

20:42.452 --> 20:44.800
They're showing A Night at the Opera tonight.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.055
Marx Brothers.

20:46.055 --> 20:47.637
I was wondering if you're planning to go.

20:47.637 --> 20:50.254
I'll be reviewing the field coil equations.

20:50.254 --> 20:54.021
They need to be finished in time for tomorrow's reactor test.

20:54.021 --> 20:56.131
Oh.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.592
What about dinner?

20:57.592 --> 20:59.339
You want to grab a bite?

20:59.339 --> 21:03.578
I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I have to work late into the evening.

21:03.578 --> 21:07.518
Ensign Massaro is running a diagnostic on the plasma assembly.

21:07.518 --> 21:09.220
I'd like you to assist her.

21:09.220 --> 21:12.941
Yes, ma'am.

21:12.941 --> 21:16.073
It's because I'm different, isn't it?

21:16.073 --> 21:19.743
The reason you don't want to do anything with me.

21:19.743 --> 21:24.723
I guess it must be weird...
being with someone like me.

21:24.723 --> 21:27.739
Five days ago, I was wearing diapers.

21:27.739 --> 21:32.731
I simply believe that our attention should be focused on the ship's engines.

21:32.731 --> 21:36.464
At least until the current situation is resolved.

21:36.464 --> 21:41.905
I probably won't be around after the current situation is resolved.

21:42.844 --> 21:49.644
- Archer to T'Pol.
- Go ahead.

21:49.644 --> 21:52.825
Would you please come to my ready room?

21:52.825 --> 21:54.707
On my way.

21:57.908 --> 22:02.215
Warp drive should be functional in two weeks.

22:02.215 --> 22:05.116
I'm afraid that won't be soon enough.

22:05.116 --> 22:05.870
Sir...?

22:05.870 --> 22:12.118
According to Malcolm, the accumulation on the hull is generating a dia-magnetic field.

22:12.118 --> 22:14.945
It's having a dampening effect.

22:14.945 --> 22:19.101
The more the particulate builds up,
the more powerful the field becomes.

22:19.101 --> 22:24.408
In another four days, every system on the ship will be off-line.

22:24.408 --> 22:29.180
If we don't make it out of here by then...
we never will.

22:34.664 --> 22:35.985
Key lime pie.

22:35.985 --> 22:38.653
I suddenly realized it was my favorite dessert.

22:38.653 --> 22:41.542
Now I know why.

22:41.542 --> 22:45.215
Do these memories just come to you?

22:45.215 --> 22:48.579
Well, the older I get,
the more I remember.

22:48.579 --> 22:51.740
It's like I've lived this whole other life.

22:51.740 --> 22:53.526
I can't explain it.

22:53.526 --> 22:56.044
I can't imagine it.

22:56.044 --> 23:00.260
You wanted to ask me about something.

23:00.260 --> 23:04.948
Do you think it's possible to redirect the phase-cannons
so they can fire back onto the hull?

23:04.948 --> 23:07.294
I suppose so. Why?

23:07.294 --> 23:11.485
Well, I want to try and blast off enough of that particulate
so we can open up the launch bay doors.

23:11.485 --> 23:13.846
Is someone planning on going somewhere?

23:13.846 --> 23:17.704
All we need to do is build up enough momentum to get the ship out of here, right?

23:17.704 --> 23:18.506
Right.

23:18.506 --> 23:22.843
Well, we've got two perfectly good engines sitting in the launch bay.

23:22.843 --> 23:28.950
If we string a couple of grappler lines between the shuttlepods and the ship, we can tow ourselves clear.

23:28.950 --> 23:31.872
The shuttlepods don't generate that kind of thrust.

23:31.872 --> 23:35.382
We'd never build up enough momentum to get clear of the field in time.

23:35.382 --> 23:37.795
Leave that to me.

23:52.438 --> 23:55.863
Can I come in?

23:57.330 --> 24:00.964
Did you have a chance to look at my calculations?

24:00.964 --> 24:02.865
I reviewed them thoroughly.

24:02.865 --> 24:06.005
And?

24:06.005 --> 24:10.029
A fusion overburn has never been attempted with a shuttlepod engine.

24:10.029 --> 24:11.956
That doesn't mean it won't work.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.715
I agree.

24:13.715 --> 24:16.669
Despite the risks, I believe it's our best option.

24:16.669 --> 24:20.401
So you're going to recommend the plan to the Captain?

24:20.401 --> 24:24.504
I already have.

24:24.504 --> 24:29.401
Was there something else?

24:29.401 --> 24:32.552
You and Trip used to spend a lot of time here together.

24:32.552 --> 24:36.525
I was instructing him in the practice of Vulcan neuro-pressure.

24:36.525 --> 24:39.752
I remember.

24:39.752 --> 24:45.119
We were lying right there, working on the neural nodes of each other's feet,

24:45.119 --> 24:50.516
talking about the warp engines, how I was hoping to modify them.

24:50.516 --> 24:53.245
How Commander Tucker was hoping to modify them.

24:53.245 --> 24:57.190
Right. Commander Tucker.

24:57.190 --> 25:00.410
You know, he was really starting to enjoy those sessions with you.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.798
They were helping him sleep.

25:02.798 --> 25:05.908
I'm not sure that's the only reason.

25:05.908 --> 25:08.501
What do you mean?

25:10.503 --> 25:15.327
Was there ever anything between you and Trip?

25:15.327 --> 25:20.652
If you're referring to a romantic relationship, no.

25:20.652 --> 25:25.237
The reason I ask is...

25:25.237 --> 25:29.355
Well...

25:29.355 --> 25:35.592
You're all I think about, if you know what I mean,
and I'm not talking about an adolescent crush.

25:35.592 --> 25:36.620
That was...

25:36.620 --> 25:40.825
Well, that was two days ago.

25:40.825 --> 25:46.010
This is much more serious,
the way I feel about you.

25:46.010 --> 25:55.766
Anyway, what's driving me crazy is,
I don't know if these feelings are mine... or his.

25:55.766 --> 25:59.905
I can't answer that.

25:59.905 --> 26:02.253
I didn't mean to make you feel uncomfortable.

26:02.253 --> 26:05.662
I'm not uncomfortable.

26:05.662 --> 26:12.148
I just thought I should tell you this
while I still had the chance.

26:14.098 --> 26:16.111
Come in.

26:17.906 --> 26:20.101
I want to pilot one of the shuttlepods.

26:20.101 --> 26:21.248
That's out of the question.

26:21.248 --> 26:24.148
It's my plan. I think I should have a say
in how it's implemented.

26:24.148 --> 26:26.840
This is a dangerous procedure.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.526
You've never flown a shuttlepod before.

26:28.526 --> 26:29.642
Yes, I have.

26:29.642 --> 26:32.876
Trip has thousands of hours of flying time, and I have his memories.

26:32.876 --> 26:38.524
I can't jeopardize this ship on the strength of those memories.

26:38.524 --> 26:44.188
Mayweather and Reed will pilot the shuttlepods.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.960
I want you to coordinate from the bridge.

26:45.960 --> 26:47.601
T'Pol will assist you.

26:47.601 --> 26:52.446
You're worried something will happen to me, aren't you?

26:53.196 --> 26:57.293
You want to make sure I'm around
because you need part of my brain.

26:57.293 --> 26:59.504
Yeah.

26:59.504 --> 27:00.667
That's part of it.

27:00.667 --> 27:03.627
So your concern for my safety is really about saving Trip.

27:03.627 --> 27:06.501
My main concern is that this plan work.

27:06.501 --> 27:10.778
If we don't make it out of here in the next six hours,
it won't matter whether Trip survives or not.

27:10.778 --> 27:14.027
We'll all be dead.

27:14.027 --> 27:16.081
I've realigned the targeting scanners.

27:16.081 --> 27:18.147
They're set for close proximity.

27:18.147 --> 27:20.953
Phase-cannons are charged and ready.

27:29.994 --> 27:32.373
Try the doors.

27:32.373 --> 27:35.694
They're still frozen.

27:45.687 --> 27:47.327
Archer to Shuttlepods One and Two.

27:47.327 --> 27:48.895
You are clear to launch.

27:48.895 --> 27:50.044
Acknowledged.

27:50.044 --> 27:52.506
Shuttlepod Two, acknowledged.

28:13.412 --> 28:16.607
Whenever you're ready.

28:16.607 --> 28:18.858
Set the overburn ratio.

28:18.858 --> 28:21.300
We'll start at oh-point-one-seven-five.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.578
Acknowledged.

28:22.578 --> 28:24.532
Oh-point-one-seven-five.

28:24.532 --> 28:28.482
Prepare to initiate on my mark.

28:28.482 --> 28:30.104
Now.

28:34.298 --> 28:35.928
1,000 kilodynes.

28:35.928 --> 28:38.858
Thrust vector holding steady.

28:42.928 --> 28:46.082
Come on.

28:47.861 --> 28:49.931
2,000 kilodynes.

28:49.931 --> 28:52.109
Engine temperature's rising!

28:55.277 --> 28:57.674
I'm reading zero forward momentum.

28:57.674 --> 28:59.949
2,500 kilodynes.

28:59.949 --> 29:01.762
Engine temperature is nearing critical.

29:01.762 --> 29:03.201
We're still not moving.

29:03.201 --> 29:04.344
Come on!

29:04.344 --> 29:07.882
Increase the overburn ratio another 30%.

29:07.882 --> 29:10.882
Captain?

29:10.882 --> 29:13.588
Go ahead.

29:13.588 --> 29:16.435
Increasing 30%.

29:20.116 --> 29:22.867
I've got a temperature warning light.

29:22.867 --> 29:26.483
I'm reading 500 degrees above critical!

29:30.576 --> 29:32.099
Their systems are overloading.

29:32.099 --> 29:33.361
Sim?

29:33.361 --> 29:34.440
A few more seconds.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.993
They won't last a few seconds.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.992
Sorry, Sim.

29:39.992 --> 29:42.450
Archer to shuttlepods.

29:52.250 --> 29:54.712
We're moving.

29:54.712 --> 29:59.429
.62 kilometers per hour.

30:04.685 --> 30:09.669
12 kilometers per hour.... and accelerating.

30:14.731 --> 30:15.907
How much do we need?

30:15.907 --> 30:19.766
At this speed, we'll emerge from the field in 6.1 hours.

30:19.766 --> 30:21.779
That's good enough.

30:21.779 --> 30:27.042
Archer to Shuttlepods One and Two... come on home.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.908
Well done.

30:31.908 --> 30:33.875
Thanks, Captain.

30:39.572 --> 30:43.580
You wanted to see me?

30:43.580 --> 30:45.244
There's been a development.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.265
I'm listening.

30:48.265 --> 30:52.566
Sim won't survive the transplant.

30:58.191 --> 31:02.784
You told me you can remove the tissue without harming him.

31:02.784 --> 31:06.743
That assessment was based on simbiots grown from Lyssarian DNA.

31:06.743 --> 31:10.704
My tests on Sim show that human-based simbiots are not as resilient.

31:10.704 --> 31:15.544
If I excise the quantity of neural tissue I need to save Commander Tucker...

31:15.544 --> 31:18.622
Sim will die.

31:18.622 --> 31:21.642
I'm sorry, Captain.

31:28.060 --> 31:31.634
Why not give up my life?

31:31.634 --> 31:36.220
I've only got... five, six days left anyway.

31:36.220 --> 31:39.166
That isn't how we see it.

31:39.166 --> 31:43.480
Let me ask you something, Doc.

31:43.480 --> 31:55.283
When you researched Lyssarian larvae, did you come across any references... to the Velandran Circle?

31:55.283 --> 32:01.383
They were a group of Lyssarian scientists who conducted illegal experiments on simbiots.

32:01.383 --> 32:06.563
They claimed to have developed an enzyme that stopped the rapid aging process.

32:09.615 --> 32:13.746
Is there any truth to it?

32:13.746 --> 32:17.442
Why do you think he kept it a secret?

32:17.442 --> 32:19.081
Doctor?

32:19.081 --> 32:24.072
The enzyme is experimental, with very little empirical evidence to suggest that it works.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.730
That's why I didn't mention it.

32:25.730 --> 32:28.422
There's not much evidence, but it exists.

32:28.422 --> 32:33.329
The fact is, I may not have to grow old and die in a week.

32:33.329 --> 32:38.855
There's a chance that I can live out a normal life span.

32:38.855 --> 32:42.004
I can't change what happened to him...

32:42.004 --> 32:46.843
but maybe I can change
what's going to happen to me.

32:54.033 --> 32:55.776
Come in.

33:02.611 --> 33:05.204
How long have you been staying here?

33:05.204 --> 33:13.999
I was on the way to my room last night, but...
I came here instead.

33:19.377 --> 33:21.952
These are Trip's quarters.

33:21.952 --> 33:25.484
Which is where I belong.

33:25.484 --> 33:27.615
I have his memories.

33:27.615 --> 33:30.469
I have his feelings.
I have his body.

33:30.469 --> 33:32.347
How am I not Trip?

33:32.347 --> 33:36.384
Commander Tucker is lying in Sick Bay.

33:36.384 --> 33:38.810
Then what am I?

33:38.810 --> 33:41.738
Just something you grew in a lab?

33:41.738 --> 33:44.478
Does that make it easier for you to condemn me to death?

33:44.478 --> 33:48.626
If you refuse to go through with this, you'll be condemning Trip to death.

33:48.626 --> 33:49.696
I didn't put him in a coma.

33:49.696 --> 33:53.505
No... but you can save him.

33:53.505 --> 33:59.521
In a way, I will... by saving myself.

33:59.521 --> 34:02.084
Phlox says there's almost no chance that the enzyme will work.

34:02.084 --> 34:04.466
My life is at stake!

34:04.466 --> 34:06.233
Any chance is worth taking!

34:06.233 --> 34:08.489
But at what cost?!

34:08.489 --> 34:11.553
It'll take a day to synthesize the enzyme.

34:11.553 --> 34:14.510
By that time, your neural tissue won't be compatible with Trip's anymore.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.205
He'll die.

34:16.205 --> 34:19.949
I know.

34:19.949 --> 34:22.355
I can't let that happen.

34:22.355 --> 34:24.772
So, what are you going to do?

34:24.772 --> 34:27.149
Drag me down to Sick Bay?

34:27.149 --> 34:31.536
Force me onto a bio-bed at gunpoint?

34:31.536 --> 34:38.842
If you truly have all of Trip's memories...
you know the answer to that.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.800
I don't have to tell you what's at stake.

34:40.800 --> 34:46.281
I must complete this mission, and to do that, I need Trip!

34:46.281 --> 34:48.612
Trip!

34:48.612 --> 34:51.652
I'll take whatever steps necessary to save him.

34:51.652 --> 34:58.389
- Even if it means killing me.
- Even if it means killing you.

34:58.389 --> 35:02.703
You're not a murderer.

35:02.703 --> 35:06.861
Don't make me one.

35:16.419 --> 35:18.621
I was wondering if there's anything I could still do.

35:18.621 --> 35:23.749
Maybe there's a panel I could install or something.

35:23.749 --> 35:27.544
I've got a few hours to kill before my operation.

35:27.544 --> 35:30.689
You wish to spend your last hours in Engineering?

35:30.689 --> 35:32.340
Why not?

35:32.340 --> 35:36.263
The two things I care about most are in this room.

35:36.263 --> 35:39.825
If you'd like, the A-3 injector port needs replacing.

35:39.825 --> 35:42.440
I'll get right on it.

36:04.795 --> 36:07.370
- What's the problem?
- Someone's rerouted the launch bay controls.

36:07.370 --> 36:09.962
We're shut out.

36:09.962 --> 36:13.368
Archer to Launch Bay; come in.

36:13.368 --> 36:16.638
Captain, I'm reading one person in there.

36:27.103 --> 36:29.681
I was all ready to do it.

36:29.681 --> 36:31.308
What stopped you?

36:31.308 --> 36:34.010
Where the hell was I going to go?

36:34.010 --> 36:36.996
We're nowhere near any habitable planet.

36:36.996 --> 36:41.760
Didn't really want to spend the rest of my life floating around in a shuttlepod.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.114
Which doesn't even have any toilet facilities.

36:45.114 --> 36:48.207
Can you imagine a lousier way to spend your old age?

36:48.207 --> 36:50.017
Cooped up in that thing?

36:50.017 --> 36:52.302
Peeing in a bottle?

36:52.302 --> 36:55.015
Actually, I can imagine a worse fate.

36:55.015 --> 36:57.503
What would that be?

36:57.503 --> 36:59.956
Being stuck in there with Malcolm.

37:04.291 --> 37:10.021
Damn. This is a screwed-up situation.

37:10.021 --> 37:13.440
I can't argue with you there.

37:13.440 --> 37:18.288
A lifetime in eight days.

37:18.288 --> 37:21.208
It's not that I'm scared of dying.

37:21.208 --> 37:29.480
It's just that... I can't imagine not being here tomorrow.

37:34.738 --> 37:36.465
You want to know what really stopped me?

37:36.465 --> 37:37.780
What?

37:37.780 --> 37:40.391
My sister.

37:40.391 --> 37:44.422
And she was my sister as much as Trip's.

37:47.019 --> 37:49.347
I believe that.

37:49.347 --> 37:55.027
I don't want what happened to her to happen to anyone else.

37:55.027 --> 38:00.947
That's why I gave the order to create you.

38:02.917 --> 38:06.036
Do me a favor when this is over.

38:06.036 --> 38:14.960
If Commander Tucker decides to do any more modifications to the engines... tell him to watch his ass.

38:27.639 --> 38:28.975
Yes?

38:28.975 --> 38:31.820
We're ready for you.

38:34.536 --> 38:36.716
On my way.

38:49.354 --> 38:52.288
May I come in?

38:58.857 --> 39:07.227
I just wanted to say... how much your absence will affect the crew...

39:07.227 --> 39:10.349
How much it will affect me.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.387
I appreciate that.

39:12.387 --> 39:15.855
All in all... I've had a pretty good life.

39:25.073 --> 39:30.119
I couldn't have asked for a better going away present.

39:42.362 --> 39:46.615
I'm sorry I doubted you, Doc.

39:46.615 --> 39:47.977
No need to apologize.

39:47.977 --> 39:49.474
Yes, there is.

39:49.474 --> 39:53.411
You see, I don't just remember Trip's childhood.

39:53.411 --> 39:56.645
I remember mine.

39:56.645 --> 39:59.820
You made a damned good father.

39:59.820 --> 40:03.136
You were a damned good son.

40:03.136 --> 40:12.010
You said to me once that commanding a starship was what you were meant to do.

40:12.010 --> 40:16.582
I guess this is what I was meant to do.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.869
Good luck, Captain.

40:18.869 --> 40:23.026
Thanks.

40:30.640 --> 40:32.947
You owe me one.

40:55.763 --> 41:00.964
We will never forget what he did for us and for the ship he loved so much.

41:00.964 --> 41:05.339
We will go forward with renewed determination to complete this mission,

41:05.339 --> 41:10.179
so that his sacrifice won't just have been for the people on this ship...

41:10.179 --> 41:13.640
but for all the citizens of Earth.
