WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:03.135
- Here she comes.
- Okay, it's a lot. It's a lot.

00:03.169 --> 00:04.069
Oh, hello.

00:05.071 --> 00:09.241
It is fulfilling all
my goth princess fantasies.

00:09.275 --> 00:10.876
- Hi.
- Hello, beautiful.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.579
- When is your wedding?
- Two and a half months away.

00:13.613 --> 00:15.848
- [all exclaiming]
- Challenge accepted.

00:15.882 --> 00:21.220
As an Indian person, your
wedding is the epitome of your life.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.555
I could see her in something
with it, like topless.

00:23.590 --> 00:28.927
- Topless! Oh no!
- No, never use topless for a bridal gown.

00:28.962 --> 00:32.531
Feel like a kid almost when you're
trying, like, your mom's clothes.

00:32.565 --> 00:37.202
Maybe I can still be a goth
princess in a white dress.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.670
Please come in.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.174
[woman] I haven't seen
the dress since last year.

00:42.208 --> 00:42.741
Wow!

00:42.776 --> 00:43.942
I hope this thing fits.

00:43.977 --> 00:48.847
I'm two and a half months
away, my options are limited.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.683
I was surprised that she
waited this long but, uh...

00:51.718 --> 00:54.219
This is a really
quick turnaround.

00:54.254 --> 00:56.822
Do I love it? No.

00:56.856 --> 00:59.658
She's done all this work and she's
not sure if it's really gonna make

00:59.692 --> 01:02.161
as big of an impact
as she wanted.

01:02.195 --> 01:04.930
She's nervous.
Even though she's lost weight.

01:04.964 --> 01:08.534
I'm concerned it's gonna be too
small. That's where I'm at right now.

01:08.568 --> 01:10.402
[cries] Sorry.

01:18.578 --> 01:21.046
- We're at Kleinfeld.
- [whooping]

01:21.681 --> 01:24.683
Oh, my God. It's super loud.

01:24.717 --> 01:27.119
Hopefully I find
my wedding dress today.

01:28.354 --> 01:29.421
Ooh!

01:32.492 --> 01:34.493
- That's a lot of dress.
- That's a lot of dress.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.096
Oh, yeah. Ah!

01:37.464 --> 01:39.798
Less dress.

01:39.833 --> 01:45.671
I'm from Brooklyn, New York and I'm here
because somebody decided to marry me.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.374
So, I need a dress.
I've been told.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.376
- Okay, I'm Alex.
- I'm James.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.881
And we're engaged!

01:55.915 --> 01:59.284
I think James wants to see
me in a dress that's a full dress.

01:59.319 --> 02:03.956
I own a lot of clothes that he
calls, "Not a shirt and not pants."

02:03.990 --> 02:08.227
And if I came out with like,
two lace pasties and a thong,

02:08.261 --> 02:12.631
he'd be like, "That's my wife.
That's... That's who I'm marrying."

02:12.665 --> 02:16.635
But I kind of want to shock
him, maybe keep it a little classy.

02:16.669 --> 02:18.837
What is this trumpet? When it
comes down, it comes out like that.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.140
- I don't know. I've never done this before.
- I haven't either.

02:21.174 --> 02:26.712
I've been told I'm a perfect mashup of
like Lucille Ball and Morticia Addams.

02:26.746 --> 02:31.283
So, like, I could be a in a black
dress with a train or I could, like,

02:31.317 --> 02:32.818
look like a 1950s, like,
pin-up doll.

02:32.852 --> 02:36.555
I'm kind of all over the place
as far as my style.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.690
Do you think they
have black dresses?

02:38.725 --> 02:42.494
- I just wanna see one.
- Try, but I have... Do you know,

02:42.529 --> 02:44.129
that was Sarah Jessica
Parker's biggest regret?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.899
- That she wore a black dress on her wedding day?
- Yes, I know, but...

02:46.933 --> 02:51.703
-I'm not a bride. I mean, I'm a
bride-- -Honey, you're a bride.

02:51.738 --> 02:55.474
Today, I brought my best friend,
Allyson. She's a "no BS" New York lady.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.843
- [Allyson laughs hysterically]
- Allyson.

02:57.877 --> 03:01.647
If she doesn't like it
she's not gonna be like,

03:01.681 --> 03:04.483
"Your hair looks pretty in that dress."
She'll be like, "Take it off. Next."

03:04.517 --> 03:05.784
Do they have like
a short person section?

03:05.818 --> 03:07.553
- Where are the petite?
- Where are the petite?

03:07.587 --> 03:11.089
- Hi! Alex?
- Hi. Oh, my gosh.

03:11.124 --> 03:15.661
[Krissy] I love your style, first of
all. We're gonna have so much fun.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.529
Tell me what are you
looking for?

03:17.564 --> 03:20.499
- So I don't know. We...
- [Allyson laughs]

03:20.533 --> 03:22.734
Stop. Stop. We don't know.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.338
We have the venue. So we're
getting married at the TWA hotel.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.608
Very, like,<i> Mad Men.</i> All red.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.810
I wanted to keep it
relatively small.

03:31.844 --> 03:35.080
But we're both Italians from
New York, so we have big families.

03:35.114 --> 03:38.917
Uh, so that right there is like the
cousins and the cousins' cousins.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.588
<i>So, all roads led to TWA.</i>

03:42.622 --> 03:46.358
So, I do wanna maybe
play to the 1960s theme.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.726
I love that.

03:47.760 --> 03:51.697
But I do also kinda
wanna try on a black dress.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.766
- If you guys have black dresses.
- I could totally see it.

03:54.801 --> 03:58.270
- We have some black dresses.
- Just to feel a little more comfortable.

03:58.304 --> 03:59.671
Yes, I love that.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.841
So exciting. How long
are you with your fiancÃ© for?

04:02.875 --> 04:06.311
We met seven years ago. I
was like, he's too good to be true.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.579
Just be my friend.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.748
[Alex] <i>I think when I
met James I got to a point</i>

04:09.782 --> 04:12.117
<i>where, even though
we were friends for a while,</i>

04:12.151 --> 04:16.788
<i>I just didn't want to deal with any of
the games or the getting to know people,</i>

04:16.823 --> 04:20.692
like, "Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm a mess. I sweat all the time."

04:20.727 --> 04:24.496
I never shave. My stomach
makes noise constantly

04:24.530 --> 04:27.733
"and I'm gassy. Do you
wanna hang out with me?" Like.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.836
<i>Now he still wants
to hang out with me</i>

04:31.604 --> 04:34.039
<i>and marry me for some reason.</i>

04:34.707 --> 04:37.843
Yeah, he's like calm and nice.

04:37.877 --> 04:40.679
- He balances me up for sure.
- I love that.

04:40.713 --> 04:46.285
Obviously, she doesn't look conservative
but there's a traditionalness to her

04:46.319 --> 04:48.053
despite what you might see.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.889
[Krissy] Do you want me to stay in
like a certain price point or anything?

04:50.923 --> 04:54.126
- 3,000 is, I think, where we were looking to spend.
- Okay.

04:54.160 --> 04:58.063
Try some shapes too. Especially with
the black dress because I have something

04:58.097 --> 05:01.667
in mind that's like super dramatic.
But when you put it on, you'll know

05:01.701 --> 05:03.935
- immediately if that's the route you want to go.
- Okay, yeah.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.239
I feel like I need
to see one on to be like,

05:08.241 --> 05:09.441
"Okay, I did it. I'm good."

05:09.475 --> 05:10.976
Love it. So, come on over.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.980
You could slip right into the robe.
I'm just gonna start pulling some stuff.

05:15.014 --> 05:18.884
Not that it hasn't been done and
well-executed but, in my opinion,

05:18.918 --> 05:23.822
a black gown is a little tricky for
a bride to truly feel like a bride.

05:23.856 --> 05:26.792
She's either gonna really love
them or she's gonna be okay

05:26.826 --> 05:29.127
with trying some
more traditional colors.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.197
Alex, come on out.

05:32.231 --> 05:33.265
[Alex gasps]

05:34.167 --> 05:35.467
I'll try. Okay.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.470
- This dress is making me sweat.
- [all laugh]

05:38.504 --> 05:41.640
[Alex]<i> It is so sparkly,</i>
<i>my eye goes right to it.</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:44.409
<i>I have to try this one on first.</i>

05:44.444 --> 05:45.744
Look, a white one.

05:45.778 --> 05:49.815
- I know but I am still here.
- She's like, I'm not quite there yet.

05:49.849 --> 05:53.819
Allyson is hesitant
about the black dress.

05:53.853 --> 05:57.589
Oh, my God. I can't stop
staring at it. It's so pretty.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.459
She's gonna take some
convincing. That's for sure.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.493
But I'm gonna do it.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.962
- Oh, hello, ladies.
- Whoa!

06:04.664 --> 06:06.832
- Oh, I love it.
- Alex, well?

06:06.866 --> 06:10.535
- This is a gorgeous dress.
- This is really beautiful. I love that you could

06:10.570 --> 06:14.272
- see your shoe too.
- I love that you can see the shoe.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.275
- [Alex] Allyson!
- I'm ready.

06:18.745 --> 06:22.981
- Here she comes.
- Okay, it's a lot. It's a lot, it's a lot.

06:24.217 --> 06:27.319
Okay. Alright. Okay.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.589
[Krissy] And it's short
underneath.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.859
[Alex] You can see
my shoes through this dress.

06:34.827 --> 06:38.430
It's the most "me" dress
that she's pulled out

06:38.464 --> 06:42.701
and it is fulfilling all
my goth princess fantasies.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.570
- I have thoughts.
- I know you do. I can see that.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.439
Would you like to hear my...
Would you like my feedback?

06:47.473 --> 06:48.774
[Alex] What?

06:48.808 --> 06:52.644
[Allyson] If it was Tim Burton
themed, perfect.

06:52.678 --> 06:54.746
- [Alex] Yeah.
- [Allyson] But that's not what it is.

06:54.781 --> 06:58.750
Think of the venue
and you look stunning, but...

06:59.619 --> 07:02.587
- [Alex] Hmm?
- [Allyson] Not your dress.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.157
Do you feel like
a bride in this dress?

07:08.628 --> 07:10.829
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.764
I don't. I thought I would
but I don't.

07:12.799 --> 07:15.033
- I don't have the...
- Butterflies?

07:15.067 --> 07:15.700
Yeah.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.436
I think I want something else.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.371
- I think I want--
- Like, a white dress?

07:20.339 --> 07:21.773
Well, yes.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.708
It's not gonna
get any better than that

07:23.743 --> 07:27.913
<i>and feel like if I don't find
my dress today I'll be screwed.</i>

07:27.947 --> 07:30.982
I don't know if I can say that. I'll
feel like... I'll be like Pamela Anderson

07:31.017 --> 07:33.885
and be like, "I'll just wear a
bikini and a veil." I don't know.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.555
I guess I'll just surprise
everybody and wear a white dress.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.023
White wedding.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.958
Okay.

07:46.699 --> 07:50.202
[Randy] Come on, Chewy.
Come here, right here.

07:50.236 --> 07:51.736
Good boy. Okay.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.272
We've got an appointment today.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.308
Mindy, she has a bride.

07:56.776 --> 07:57.976
Hi, beautiful.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.012
- Hi, Randy. How is it going?
- [on phone]<i> Good. How are you?</i>

08:01.047 --> 08:04.716
- I'm doing well. I'm excited to work with you today.
- Me, too.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.787
- Hi, Dorothy. Look who I have.
- Hi, cutie. What's doing?

08:08.821 --> 08:11.590
I'm gonna help Mindy today. We're
gonna help this bride find a dress.

08:11.624 --> 08:14.693
- Now, that's a dress.
- It's a heavy dress.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.928
I think it weighs more than you.

08:16.963 --> 08:20.332
- Do you want a lot of train?
- I'll give it a shot. Let's do it.

08:20.366 --> 08:23.635
It's a little crazy because
this is gonna be my first time

08:23.669 --> 08:27.339
trying on a gown and we're
so close to the wedding.

08:27.373 --> 08:28.573
- Prashanthi?
- Yes.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.542
- Hi, there. I'm Mindy.
- Hi, Mindy.

08:30.576 --> 08:32.611
- I brought a special someone. We have Randy here.
- Hi.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.413
- Hello, beautiful.
- Hi, Randy.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.582
<i>So, tell me, who's the
gentleman behind you?</i>

08:37.617 --> 08:40.886
- This is my future brother-in-law, Mike.
- How are you?

08:40.920 --> 08:43.755
He's the reason that
my fiancÃ© and I are together.

08:43.789 --> 08:47.425
- [Randy]<i> Okay, and who are you, beautiful?</i>
- I'm her friend, Sallyann.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.860
<i>Wonderful.
And what's your fiancÃ©'s name?</i>

08:48.895 --> 08:49.895
Steven.

08:49.929 --> 08:53.532
Mike and I had been working
together for so long

08:53.566 --> 08:56.902
and I say to him,
"Where are all the good guys?"

08:56.936 --> 08:59.571
And he says,
"My brother is a good guy."

08:59.605 --> 09:03.008
But he was like, "Oh, you probably
won't wanna date him, you know",

09:03.042 --> 09:06.411
<i>he's kind of a nerd and
he's really into board games.</i>

09:06.445 --> 09:08.613
And I'm like,
"I love board games."

09:08.648 --> 09:09.881
<i>You know, he connected
the both of us.</i>

09:09.916 --> 09:14.019
<i>Our first conversation
lasted about two hours</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:16.721
and I never felt that way,
you know, with anyone before.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.691
Have you thought about
your wedding dress at all?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.026
I want a big ball gown.

09:21.060 --> 09:26.898
As an Indian person, your
wedding is the epitome of your life.

09:26.933 --> 09:32.604
<i>And the one thing that I love about
Steven is he's embraced my culture so much.</i>

09:32.638 --> 09:35.473
We're doing a mehndi ceremony.

09:35.508 --> 09:36.975
<i>I'll be wearing,
what's called a lehenga.</i>

09:37.009 --> 09:40.579
<i>So it'll be a blouse and a
skirt and usually a shawl.</i>

09:40.613 --> 09:43.582
<i>And then after that
we are going to have</i>

09:43.616 --> 09:45.728
<i>a traditional Catholic ceremony.</i>

09:45.752 --> 09:50.855
And today, I'm shopping for my
bridal gown for my Catholic ceremony.

09:50.890 --> 09:56.361
I like the idea of an
empire waist, lots of tulle,

09:56.395 --> 09:58.096
lace as well, and off-shoulder.

09:58.130 --> 10:03.068
Have you tried on a dress with
empire waist with lots of tulle?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.704
- I have not.
- Okay, if you have an empire waist

10:05.738 --> 10:07.739
and then you have lots of tulle,

10:07.773 --> 10:11.142
you're probably gonna
look like you're expecting.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.545
Oh, really? Oh, yeah.
No, I don't want that.

10:13.579 --> 10:15.580
We're getting married
in a Catholic church.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.984
We want to stick to more of a
conservative look, a classy look.

10:19.018 --> 10:20.352
Now, when is your wedding?

10:20.386 --> 10:24.456
This is the crazy part. My wedding
is two and a half months away.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.792
- Oh-kay!
- Challenge accepted.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.662
Yeah, it's really...
It's really cutting it close.

10:30.696 --> 10:34.499
It may limit us a little bit
on what we can get.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.635
Yeah, most likely
what you see on the floor,

10:36.669 --> 10:40.238
it's gonna take six to eight
months to come in,

10:40.272 --> 10:42.607
so I don't want to bring in
something that you fall in love with

10:42.642 --> 10:45.410
and then I can't get it. That's
the hardest part. [chuckles]

10:45.444 --> 10:46.778
And how much
are you looking to spend?

10:46.812 --> 10:49.981
I budgeted
for about six to eight.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.852
I've been waiting so long to pick
out my dress because we didn't know

10:53.886 --> 10:57.789
what we were gonna do about
COVID, and travel, and things like that.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.792
Basically, once things seemed
a little safer,

11:00.826 --> 11:03.795
that's when we decided to go full
force. And that's why I'm here today.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.196
Oh, there's like,
a 30-pound dress over there

11:05.231 --> 11:07.632
- I think she should put on just for the fun of it.
- [women giggling]

11:07.666 --> 11:09.701
She probably doesn't weigh
30 pounds. [chuckles]

11:09.735 --> 11:11.803
Oh, it's... Randy,
it's one of your dresses.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.271
- Get out!
- [Randy]<i> Oh, let me see.</i>

11:13.305 --> 11:14.539
Is that Brussels?

11:14.573 --> 11:17.409
- I think it is Brussels.
<i>- That's the one I just wrote down.</i>

11:17.443 --> 11:18.576
- No way!
- Brussels!

11:18.611 --> 11:20.779
- Swear to God.
- It's a dropped waist.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.981
It's the exact opposite
of an empire waist.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.817
So it's actually gonna show
off way more of your figure

11:25.851 --> 11:28.586
than right underneath
that bust line.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.121
I do love it. It's incredible.

11:30.156 --> 11:34.225
And also keep in mind it's sheer on
the sides but it comes with a lining.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.760
So you will have more coverage.

11:35.795 --> 11:40.398
Oh, my goodness. Uh, like, I feel like
it just keeps selling itself even more.

11:40.432 --> 11:41.833
But I have to see
if I can get it in time.

11:41.867 --> 11:45.370
So why don't you try it on
first? And see if you like it.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.639
If she likes it, I'll call
and see what we have.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.442
Awesome! All right. So you're
actually gonna follow me this way.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.610
It's absolutely beautiful.

11:52.678 --> 11:53.978
[Prashanthi] <i>Gorgeous ballgown.</i>

11:54.013 --> 11:58.516
<i>But I'm a little bit concerned
about the amount of exposure.</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:02.954
I want to keep my... my look
conservative for the wedding.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.423
[Mindy] What do we think?

12:06.659 --> 12:09.294
- Well...
- You're taking it in, I see. [chuckles]

12:09.328 --> 12:11.162
Oh... I...

12:13.399 --> 12:15.633
I... I feel like a princess.

12:15.668 --> 12:19.037
- Good. That's what we're aiming for.
- Um...

12:19.405 --> 12:22.140
But... I...

12:22.174 --> 12:24.509
I'd love to see what other
dresses are available too.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.678
Just that provide
a little bit more coverage.

12:26.712 --> 12:31.249
Mike, Sallyann and I were
immediately drawn to Randy's dress.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.785
But I'm feeling like, "Okay."

12:33.819 --> 12:35.720
It's not exactly
what I'm looking for

12:35.755 --> 12:37.956
and then I have to tell
Randy that.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.693
Hang on, wait. I see her.
[laughs]

12:41.727 --> 12:43.461
- [Michael] Oh, my goodness.
- What do you... What...

12:43.496 --> 12:45.263
What do you think?
Do you like it?

12:45.297 --> 12:46.297
Oh, my goodness.

12:46.332 --> 12:47.365
Oh, wow...

12:50.736 --> 12:52.403
- I see tulle.
- [Sallyann laughs]

12:52.438 --> 12:54.472
Look at the size of that train.

12:54.507 --> 12:55.874
It's an insane train!

12:56.375 --> 12:57.375
Can I say something?

12:58.377 --> 12:59.277
Emotions.

12:59.311 --> 13:00.779
Aw, Mike is crying.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.982
No, 'cause, come on. Steven's gonna
see, no matter what dress you buy...

13:04.016 --> 13:07.452
When you see him look at you
the way I looked at my wife...

13:07.486 --> 13:10.555
- Aw, Mike. Never seen you this emotional.
- [Sally Ann] That's so sweet.

13:10.589 --> 13:12.590
- Michael's crying.
- Oh, Michael.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.526
- [Prashanthi] You're so...
- You guys all suck.

13:14.593 --> 13:15.794
[all laughing]

13:15.828 --> 13:18.463
- You're just...
- Not you, Randy. Not you.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.965
So, Prashanthi, how do you feel?

13:21.600 --> 13:24.435
It's... It's beautiful and...

13:24.470 --> 13:27.505
I'm just a little concerned
with the, um...

13:27.540 --> 13:29.340
With the mesh right here and...

13:29.375 --> 13:32.510
And having the back
so transparent.

13:32.545 --> 13:35.079
I'm not saying no. I'm just...

13:35.614 --> 13:36.581
There's a little concern.

13:36.615 --> 13:37.882
Well, here's the thing.

13:37.917 --> 13:44.455
You have to absolutely love it
100%. And have no hesitation.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.192
So I definitely think you need
to try on some more dresses.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.593
I think you may be right.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.662
It's a little
nerve wracking because

13:50.696 --> 13:54.199
<i>I do have a very specific
taste of what I want.</i>

13:54.233 --> 13:55.900
<i>And, you know...</i>

13:55.935 --> 13:58.469
<i>the clock is ticking. We're
two and a half months away.</i>

13:58.504 --> 14:01.039
I have to get my dress.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.477
Feel like a kid almost, when you're
trying your... Like, your mom's clothes.

14:06.512 --> 14:10.281
<i>Maybe if I can still
be a goth princess.</i>

14:10.316 --> 14:12.984
Morticia Addams bride...

14:13.419 --> 14:14.986
In a white dress.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.088
Oh, hello.

14:17.556 --> 14:18.489
Okay...

14:18.524 --> 14:20.291
<i>I hope this thing fits.</i>

14:20.326 --> 14:21.559
I did lose 50 pounds.

14:21.594 --> 14:23.428
I'm concerned
it's gonna be too small.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.129
Even though I lost 50 pounds.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.176
Okay. Well, dress one.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.179
- That was really exciting.
- Dress one. That was exciting!

14:41.213 --> 14:42.447
Wow, you know...

14:42.481 --> 14:45.617
I do love it, but I'm glad that
we're trying on other ones.

14:45.651 --> 14:47.318
I think so. I think it'll
be interesting to see

14:47.353 --> 14:49.587
something not as "poofy" on you.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.756
Maybe something
just a little slimmer.

14:51.790 --> 14:55.860
It is actually very challenging
when brides come in and they have

14:55.895 --> 14:58.563
less than three months
till their wedding.

14:58.597 --> 15:03.434
And right now I am looking at
designers that I know I can get in on time.

15:03.469 --> 15:04.769
[Mindy] I have another dress
for you.

15:04.803 --> 15:06.504
- It's with long sleeves.
- Okay. Okay.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.473
[Mindy] It's this dress
by Michelle Roth.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.408
You have
all the beautiful sparkle.

15:10.442 --> 15:11.509
- Okay.
- It's more of an A-line.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.579
So it's not as full
as the Brussels dress.

15:14.613 --> 15:16.014
[Prashanthi]<i> It's gorgeous.</i>

15:16.048 --> 15:19.684
It's got the long sleeves, which
was something that I was interested in

15:19.718 --> 15:23.421
even before walking into Kleinfeld.
And I'm real excited about that.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.525
It's beautiful. It's elegant.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.194
- But...
- [Mindy chuckles] I hear a "but".

15:30.229 --> 15:31.863
But... I don't know.

15:31.897 --> 15:35.500
- Well, see what they say. And we'll go from there.
- [Prashanthi] Yeah. Okay.

15:35.534 --> 15:38.937
I was surprised that she
waited this long. But, um...

15:38.971 --> 15:40.605
the right dress
will find itself.

15:40.639 --> 15:44.509
[hesitating] I hope so. This
is a really quick turnaround.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.045
I could see her in something
with a, like, topless.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.514
-[laughing] -No, no,
no, no. Not topless.

15:49.548 --> 15:50.815
He didn't just say that, did he?

15:50.849 --> 15:52.684
But, you know what I mean?
Like, where it cuts off.

15:52.718 --> 15:55.320
- Okay, showing shoulders.
- Yeah, the top. Okay, fine.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.487
- Shoulderless.
- Yes.

15:56.522 --> 15:58.356
- Shoulderless.
- Okay, got ya. Yeah, no, I...

15:58.390 --> 15:59.791
[producer speaking]

15:59.825 --> 16:01.392
- Strap, oh yeah.
- That, that's it. That's it.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.661
It's a... Show's rated PG.
Strapless.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.029
- Oh, my God.
- [Sallyann gasps]

16:08.400 --> 16:10.134
Oh!

16:12.738 --> 16:16.107
[Michael] You know normally, I don't
care for sleeves, but this kinda looks...

16:17.376 --> 16:18.643
This kinda has you on it.

16:18.677 --> 16:21.512
So... Do you love it?

16:21.547 --> 16:22.714
Do you like it?

16:22.748 --> 16:25.249
Do<i> you</i> love it? Do<i> you</i> like it?

16:26.685 --> 16:28.786
It's... It's beautiful.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.724
And it's conservative. And
it's got all the elements but...

16:33.492 --> 16:34.759
Not really for me.
I don't think.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.795
You know, I didn't get that
feeling when I put this one on.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.599
And for me, I think that
it's a little short-waisted.

16:41.633 --> 16:44.002
I think a drop waist is gonna...

16:44.036 --> 16:46.871
make you look a little better. It's
kind of coming out at the stomach.

16:46.905 --> 16:49.540
Turn sideways and look
in the mirror sideways.

16:49.575 --> 16:53.478
I want you to see. To me, it
comes out right at the waist.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.712
- Yeah.
- It needs to come down a little lower

16:54.747 --> 16:56.881
to really show off
your figure, I think.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.549
[stammering] I agree with you.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.985
I think, yeah, a little
lower would be better.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.554
Got it.
So if you were going to...

17:03.589 --> 17:08.192
describe what you want to see
next, what would you want to see?

17:10.295 --> 17:11.596
- So...
- Can I pick it?

17:11.630 --> 17:12.897
- Oh, I don't know.
- I wanna pick it.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.799
- I don't know. I don't know. Mindy?
- Let him pick.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.602
I think, I think Mike's
pretty good at this, actually.

17:17.636 --> 17:18.703
- Oh, really?
- [Michael] You see? You see?

17:18.737 --> 17:20.772
- Well, you got Randy's seal of approval.
- Randy...

17:20.806 --> 17:23.608
and I chose
the same first option.

17:23.642 --> 17:26.244
So I think if anyone's gonna help
you find a dress you might like.

17:26.278 --> 17:28.413
- [Prashanthi] Okay. Well...
- The only thing is Mike's gotta work

17:28.447 --> 17:29.781
on his terminology.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.316
He said he wanted
a topless dress

17:32.351 --> 17:34.052
instead of a strapless dress.
[laughs]

17:34.086 --> 17:37.622
- Topless, oh, no!
- Yeah, no. Never use "topless"

17:37.656 --> 17:38.823
for a bridal gown.

17:38.857 --> 17:43.895
Mike is a very, you know,
quirky, unique, crazy character.

17:43.929 --> 17:47.932
And I'm thinking to myself,
"What is he going to do?"

17:50.469 --> 17:51.769
[woman] She loves it.

17:51.804 --> 17:54.305
One and done!
Easiest appointment!

17:58.410 --> 17:59.510
- Next.
- Next?

17:59.545 --> 18:02.447
- Oh, do you mean this next?
- [laughing]

18:02.481 --> 18:03.781
Do you work here now?

18:04.416 --> 18:05.850
The black dress is awesome.

18:05.884 --> 18:10.588
<i>I love it. But it's more of an
event dress than a wedding dress.</i>

18:10.622 --> 18:12.390
<i>And this is my best friend.</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:15.059
It's the one day
that she can be a bride.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.296
- Okay, so Allyson, kind of, pulled this, I guess?
- Yeah.

18:18.330 --> 18:21.399
<i>I don't think that I want</i>

18:21.433 --> 18:24.035
this long-sleeved white dress.

18:24.069 --> 18:27.805
Feel like a kid almost, when you're
trying your... Like, your mom's clothes.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.709
<i>But, maybe I can still
be a goth princess.</i>

18:31.743 --> 18:36.514
Morticia Addams,
but<i> Mad Men</i> bride...

18:36.548 --> 18:39.350
<i>- in a white dress. We'll see.</i>
- [chuckles]

18:40.452 --> 18:41.619
Okay. Okay.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.955
- [Alex] Okay, Allyson.
- Okay...

18:45.557 --> 18:47.625
- Oh, hello!
- Okay.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.428
- Okay, wait.
- [Allyson] Ooh! Alex!

18:50.462 --> 18:53.064
- Oh, hi.
- I know. Okay.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.300
- Okay.
- [Krissy] Thoughts?

18:56.335 --> 18:58.302
- There's a dress.
- There's a dress.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.672
This is a great dress.

19:01.707 --> 19:05.309
I love how it gets her figure
like, so beautifully.

19:05.344 --> 19:06.277
So do I.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.112
I'm... [clears throat]

19:08.147 --> 19:10.648
-I think-- -A little
speechless. [chuckles]

19:10.682 --> 19:14.318
I think, I think you're
feeling the white dress vibes.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.487
I feel like a bride
in this dress.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.589
That's so cheesy. [laughs]

19:18.624 --> 19:19.891
- It's not cheesy, you're a bride.
- Aw.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.592
I'm a bride.
I feel like a bride.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.060
[clears throat]

19:23.562 --> 19:24.662
Yeah, oh, wow.

19:24.696 --> 19:27.398
I don't know if this
is the one but, like...

19:28.700 --> 19:31.169
- Yeah. Yep.
- It's a different feeling.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.670
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.272
I feel beautiful
in this dress. It's...

19:34.306 --> 19:35.506
I don't know how you could not.

19:35.541 --> 19:39.544
<i>But it doesn't fit the vibe
that we're really going for.</i>

19:39.578 --> 19:43.314
I think I wanna try a white,
simple dress

19:43.348 --> 19:46.217
but maybe something
with no sleeves.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.451
I have something in mind.

19:47.486 --> 19:50.755
- Okay.
- That could possibly be perfect.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.724
Blowing my mind right now.
[laughs]

19:53.759 --> 19:57.328
<i>I'm surprised, like, the
direction my brain is going in.</i>

19:57.362 --> 19:59.764
Like, I think I want
to look like

19:59.798 --> 20:01.832
a traditional bride,
a little bit.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.703
I think James is gonna be
so surprised. [chuckles]

20:05.737 --> 20:07.471
I'm getting nervous
but I'm excited.

20:07.506 --> 20:09.307
- Don't be. Don't be.
- Okay.

20:09.341 --> 20:11.409
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.711
- I'll be here.
- [Krissy chuckles]

20:13.745 --> 20:15.379
[Jen] Oh, my God.
I hope this thing fits.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.782
Jen does see herself
in her old body.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.584
<i>Even though she's lost
so much weight.</i>

20:19.618 --> 20:23.754
She's still not
that comfortable with herself.

20:23.789 --> 20:26.057
Michael, what did you
pick for me?

20:26.091 --> 20:27.358
- I think it's pretty close.
- [Prashanthi] Okay.

20:28.694 --> 20:31.095
I'm really not sure
what I'm gonna do.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.635
Getting ready
to go to Kleinfeld.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.470
- So exciting!
- [all whooping]

20:39.504 --> 20:41.672
For my fitting. We're all ready.

20:41.707 --> 20:44.375
- We got our hair done.
- [all chuckling]

20:54.319 --> 20:55.586
- I'm excited to see.
- I agree.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.588
- Feels like it's been forever, you know?
- Yeah.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.390
It has. It's been, like, a year.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.759
[woman] If we don't get
the dress right...

21:01.793 --> 21:03.995
- So, she's a fighter.
- She may use some of those moves on us.

21:04.029 --> 21:07.265
I became a Taekwondo master
which is a fourth degree blackbelt

21:07.299 --> 21:08.366
at age 18.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.433
[kicks and yells]

21:09.468 --> 21:11.102
This is my first time shopping.

21:11.136 --> 21:15.273
And this is gonna be my last time
shopping. I've a really good feeling.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.242
Is this the dress?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.678
[all cheering]

21:20.712 --> 21:22.513
I know I'm gonna love the dress.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.215
I'm not nervous about that.

21:24.249 --> 21:27.285
But nervous trying it on.
I did lose 50 pounds.

21:27.319 --> 21:28.686
So, seeing how
it's going to fit,

21:28.720 --> 21:32.056
but more nervousness
that it's not going to fit.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.425
I don't know why that would
be a thing but that's...

21:34.459 --> 21:35.826
I guess, what I'm most
nervous about,

21:35.861 --> 21:38.829
that it's not going to fit
even though I lost 50 pounds.

21:38.864 --> 21:40.898
- Are they gonna suck it right in?
- Maybe.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.667
- Right here in the waist line.
- You don't know.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.902
- You don't know.
- No. It's definitely going to be smaller.

21:44.936 --> 21:49.307
She started her weight loss
journey because she saw

21:49.341 --> 21:51.776
her<i> Say Yes To The Dress</i> show.

21:51.810 --> 21:57.348
She saw herself
in the dress and felt bad.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.582
You know, big.

21:58.617 --> 22:01.952
And, um, not beautiful.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.889
[Jennifer]<i> That was actually</i>
<i>the turning point, literally.</i>

22:04.923 --> 22:07.458
<i>My episode came out
and I was like,</i>

22:07.492 --> 22:09.360
<i>"That's it.
Things need to change."</i>

22:09.394 --> 22:12.096
And I am very proud of myself.

22:12.597 --> 22:13.564
Jennifer?

22:13.598 --> 22:15.499
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, how are you?

22:15.534 --> 22:17.101
- I'm great.
- My name is Loren.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.403
I'm going to be your fitter
today. Are you girls ready?

22:19.438 --> 22:20.471
- Yes.
- Very ready.

22:20.505 --> 22:22.373
- Okay. Please follow me.
- Awesome.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.041
She's done all of this work

22:24.076 --> 22:27.611
and she's not sure if it's really going to
make as big of an impact as she wanted.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.313
- Yes. For sure.
- Yeah, she is nervous.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.715
Please come in.

22:31.650 --> 22:35.286
- Here we are.
- Wow! That is a good dress.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.722
[laughs nervously] Oh, my Gosh!

22:37.756 --> 22:39.056
- [Loren] Shall we?
- [Jennifer] Yes.

22:39.091 --> 22:42.660
I'm concerned it's going to be
too small. Like, I know it's not true,

22:42.694 --> 22:44.762
but I tend to do that anyway.

22:44.796 --> 22:47.565
Yeah. That's where
I'm at right now.

22:47.599 --> 22:51.769
I think that Jen does see
herself in her old body still today.

22:51.803 --> 22:54.638
Um, even though she's lost
so much weight.

22:54.673 --> 22:58.509
She's still not
that comfortable yet

22:58.543 --> 23:00.578
with herself, you know.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.880
[Jennifer]<i> Oh, my God.</i>
<i>I hope this thing fits.</i>

23:03.315 --> 23:04.949
Been a long time.

23:07.486 --> 23:10.721
Yeah. And a lot of hard work.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.323
<i>I don't know why
I'm getting emotional now.</i>

23:13.492 --> 23:15.359
Sorry. [sniffles]

23:17.396 --> 23:18.429
[Loren] Okay.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.501
Come with me over here.

23:23.535 --> 23:24.502
Pick a winner.

23:24.536 --> 23:27.638
Mike is picking out
my next dress.

23:27.672 --> 23:30.541
I don't know how to feel
about that. I did bring him

23:30.575 --> 23:32.643
so I will put it on.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.378
So I know princess
is a big thing.

23:34.679 --> 23:35.946
Romantic.

23:35.981 --> 23:39.583
My biggest fear is that I put
her in a gown that I can't get.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.819
I want to make sure that
everything we're looking at

23:41.853 --> 23:45.823
is time-okay, it's the
aesthetic that she's looking for,

23:45.857 --> 23:49.059
um, and something that
she really feels like she loves.

23:49.094 --> 23:52.696
This is all Michelle Roth. It's the
same designer that she currently has on.

23:52.731 --> 23:54.598
<i>She does really good
rush orders.</i>

23:54.633 --> 23:57.601
Um, anything popping out at you?

23:57.636 --> 24:00.871
[Michael] I like that.
Maybe this might be it.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.873
I found one with a little bit
of flowers on it.

24:02.908 --> 24:05.476
Something that had the kind
of train she liked.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.345
The, um, strapless... and...

24:08.380 --> 24:10.514
I think maybe she could
look good in it.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.416
Michael, what did you
pick for me?

24:12.451 --> 24:14.185
- I think it's pretty close.
- Okay.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.288
I like it.

24:17.322 --> 24:18.322
I like it a lot.

24:19.157 --> 24:20.391
I'm surprised.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.793
<i>It's gorgeous.
It has the flowers.</i>

24:22.828 --> 24:25.329
<i>It has, you know,
the beautiful flowy skirt.</i>

24:25.363 --> 24:27.865
It exceeds all my expectations.

24:28.366 --> 24:29.333
- Oh, team.
- Team.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.501
- Triple it.
- Team.

24:30.535 --> 24:32.470
- Let's all... Let's all high-five.
- [Mindy laughing]

24:32.504 --> 24:33.771
Why did I doubt him?

24:33.805 --> 24:38.542
He, you know, brought me
and Steven together, my fiancÃ©.

24:38.577 --> 24:41.479
<i>So he obviously knows
what's he doing.</i>

24:41.513 --> 24:43.247
What do we think of this one?

24:45.550 --> 24:51.455
I will say that I appreciate
what Mike did.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.525
- Do I love it? No.
- No.

24:54.559 --> 24:56.794
I do like the off-shoulder look

24:56.828 --> 24:59.463
<i>but doing the big reveal</i>

24:59.498 --> 25:01.098
<i>I don't feel like it's worth it,</i>

25:01.132 --> 25:03.133
when I know in my heart that
it's not the one I'm gonna pick.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.103
So, come on in.

25:07.639 --> 25:09.073
What do you think?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.175
Do you like it?

25:12.344 --> 25:13.577
I like it.

25:13.612 --> 25:17.815
However, now seeing it on you
and your frown...

25:17.849 --> 25:21.585
I'm not frowning.
I will say I appreciate

25:21.620 --> 25:24.421
how you, uh,
came to this conclusion.

25:24.456 --> 25:27.625
I will take my failure
with, uh, honor.

25:27.659 --> 25:28.792
I will be back in just
a couple of minutes.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.461
I'm going to go pull
some more for you.

25:30.495 --> 25:33.831
My wedding is two
and a half months away.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.300
<i>If I don't find the dress today,</i>

25:37.936 --> 25:40.004
I'm really not sure
what I'm going to do.

25:42.407 --> 25:45.309
That's my dress.
I think that's my dress.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.746
I think, I'm going
to start to cry, like I...

25:49.481 --> 25:51.215
Like, I think this is my dress.

25:53.585 --> 25:55.286
I can't control it.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.333
Nope.

26:09.367 --> 26:11.502
I mean, I know
a lot of these dresses

26:11.536 --> 26:13.604
are dresses that Prashanthi
would really love

26:13.638 --> 26:17.341
but none of them I can
get in time for her wedding.

26:17.375 --> 26:20.144
- How can I help?
- Hi, Dorothy.

26:20.178 --> 26:22.680
First of all, she's looking for
something a little bit more conservative.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.782
- Okay.
- She likes sparkle. She like tulle.

26:24.816 --> 26:27.718
She likes that kind
of princessy vibe.

26:27.752 --> 26:31.789
What she is asking for
is not unheard of.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.691
It's just
her timeframe is pretty close

26:33.725 --> 26:37.394
and I don't want to disappoint her by
not being able to get what she wants.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.730
Did you look in the
in-stock dresses at all?

26:39.764 --> 26:40.764
I didn't 'cause I know,
she's wanting something

26:40.799 --> 26:43.701
a little more covered
but I'll look there now.

26:43.735 --> 26:46.003
- You know, let me take a peek.
- Yeah, take a look.

26:47.305 --> 26:48.606
Minutes are going by

26:48.640 --> 26:51.508
and I'm starting
to get in my head

26:51.542 --> 26:53.544
I'm two and a half months away.

26:53.578 --> 26:56.614
My, you know, options
are limited.

26:56.648 --> 26:57.948
The pressure is on.

26:57.983 --> 27:00.784
-Can you just do me a favor.
Just look at this one second -Sure.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.320
This one here, it's tiny
with the off-the-shoulder.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.956
Possibly. Possibly.

27:06.324 --> 27:06.924
Okay.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.327
So Kleinfeld has
a limited selection

27:10.362 --> 27:12.496
of what we call
as "in-stock" gowns.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.299
They are brand new dresses

27:15.333 --> 27:17.468
in a variety of sizes and shapes

27:17.502 --> 27:20.237
for brides with close
wedding dates.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.238
[knocking at door]

27:21.272 --> 27:23.540
- Prashanthi, can I come in?
- [Prashanthi] Yes.

27:23.575 --> 27:26.577
- Awesome. Okay. Take a look at this one.
- Okay.

27:26.611 --> 27:27.745
- It's brand new.
- Wow.

27:27.779 --> 27:30.414
We like to keep
a collection of in-stock gowns

27:30.448 --> 27:32.583
just for these purposes

27:32.617 --> 27:34.451
when we have
our close-date brides.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.452
What I love about this

27:35.487 --> 27:36.854
is it's different
than the first one,

27:36.888 --> 27:38.856
- it's kind of this all-over detail.
- Uh-huh.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.291
- And it's got the off-the-shoulder.
- Ah! I love.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.860
- Yeah?
- I love.

27:43.361 --> 27:46.096
It is pure elegance.

27:47.532 --> 27:49.166
Oh, my God!

27:49.401 --> 27:50.901
Wow!

27:50.935 --> 27:55.239
I don't even know what to say. Like,
let's see if we can make Mike cry again.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.340
Let's do it.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.242
- Oh!
- [gasping] She's coming.

27:58.276 --> 27:59.410
She's coming.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.383
- [Michael] Oh!
- Oh, wow!

28:07.252 --> 28:08.285
Beautiful.

28:09.554 --> 28:10.387
<i>That's gorgeous.</i>

28:11.856 --> 28:14.625
[Mindy] <i>This is kind of like
a one-in-a-million chance</i>

28:14.659 --> 28:18.228
<i>that we have the dress
that is perfect,</i>

28:18.263 --> 28:20.197
<i>in stock, in her size,</i>

28:20.231 --> 28:21.432
<i>ready to go.</i>

28:21.466 --> 28:23.233
<i>Prashanthi, how do your feel?</i>

28:24.569 --> 28:28.439
Randy, I absolutely love it.

28:29.174 --> 28:30.207
Whoo!

28:30.241 --> 28:31.709
I love the sparkle.

28:31.743 --> 28:34.445
- I think... I think this is perfect, right?
- [Sallyann] It's beautiful.

28:34.479 --> 28:35.813
[Mindy] Absolutely. I mean,

28:35.847 --> 28:38.549
I don't know if you can tell.
Take a look in the mirror for me.

28:38.583 --> 28:39.483
[Dorothy] What's the verdict?

28:39.517 --> 28:41.018
Oh, Dorothy, we love it.

28:41.052 --> 28:46.190
And the great thing is that it's in
stock. You can walk out with it today.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.524
<i>That's huge.</i>

28:47.559 --> 28:49.560
I feel like the stars aligned,

28:49.594 --> 28:51.628
that this is the dress for me.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.263
- Look how happy she looks.
- Mmm-hmm.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.299
I am, I am very, very happy.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.633
Steven's gonna flip out.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.270
He's going to see her
finally in a dress.

29:00.305 --> 29:03.006
That moment, he'll get one...

29:03.041 --> 29:05.743
- Oh!
- Mike's getting emotional again.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.778
Mike's going to hide
from the camera again.

29:07.812 --> 29:10.781
We were afraid, knowing
that there might not be a dress

29:10.815 --> 29:12.716
for her to take home in
such a short period of time.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.753
And we're good.
Everything's... I love it.

29:15.787 --> 29:17.654
What kind of veil
would you recommend?

29:17.689 --> 29:21.592
A simple one or something
a little more extravagant.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.795
<i>Um, I think the dress
has a lot going on,</i>

29:24.829 --> 29:28.499
so you want to keep it clean
around the face

29:28.533 --> 29:32.069
because if you
have lace around your face,

29:32.103 --> 29:34.037
<i>to me, it takes away
from your beauty.</i>

29:34.472 --> 29:36.039
I like that veil.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.009
I feel like royalty.

29:39.477 --> 29:42.346
It is so gorgeous.

29:42.380 --> 29:43.647
<i>I'm feeling all tingly.</i>

29:43.681 --> 29:46.984
<i>And it's it.</i>

29:47.385 --> 29:48.485
This is it.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.654
The moment. I know it.

29:51.589 --> 29:54.258
Mindy, I think we need
to ask the question.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.592
I think so too, Randy.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.427
Prashanthi...

29:57.462 --> 30:00.130
[both] Are you saying
"Yes" to the dress?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.301
I'm saying "Yes" to the dress.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.435
[all cheering]

30:05.470 --> 30:08.338
Congratulations! Oh, congrats!

30:08.373 --> 30:09.273
Thank you.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.507
There are so many emotions.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.444
I'm feeling excited.
I'm feeling grateful.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.947
I'm feeling relieved.

30:16.981 --> 30:21.418
<i>It's just like, everything that I
wanted to happen today did.</i>

30:21.452 --> 30:23.854
And I got my dress.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.489
Congratulations.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.925
Thank you, Randy. Thank
you so much for your help.

30:27.959 --> 30:31.662
Oh, it was such a pleasure to be a
part of this appointment. Really. Truly.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.131
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.033
Bye! Mwah!

30:46.144 --> 30:49.980
This has like, all the vintage
vibes that we're looking for.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.850
Just like classic, Jackie O,
'60s kind of vibe.

30:52.884 --> 30:57.621
Nice low back. We're going
to get our modern flair.

30:57.655 --> 30:58.822
This is clean cut, classic,

30:58.857 --> 31:02.559
but still has a little bit
of a sexy, modern feel to it.

31:02.594 --> 31:07.331
Which for me is just screaming
the TWA Terminal at JFK.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.169
Oh, my God!

31:12.503 --> 31:14.171
I... Yeah.

31:16.574 --> 31:19.710
That's my dress.
I think that's my dress.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.980
I think I'm going
to start to cry, like I...

31:23.715 --> 31:25.415
Like, I think, this is my dress.

31:28.253 --> 31:29.653
I can't control it.

31:29.687 --> 31:31.722
- [sniffing]
- Oh, my God!

31:31.756 --> 31:33.357
[Krissy] I can't wait
to see you in it.

31:33.391 --> 31:34.892
Like, I-I, really...

31:34.926 --> 31:36.393
Honestly, I've never
had a bride, like, react

31:36.427 --> 31:38.028
- just seeing a dress.
- Great.

31:38.730 --> 31:40.163
This feels like my dress.

31:41.332 --> 31:42.866
Um. [sniffles]

31:42.901 --> 31:44.434
- I'm going to get you a tissue.
- Um...

31:45.436 --> 31:47.170
[gasping]

31:49.440 --> 31:53.343
My dad... um... passed away...

31:53.378 --> 31:55.012
- [Krissy] Oh, my God!
- ...in August.

31:55.046 --> 31:56.446
- [sniffing]
- [Krissy] I'm so sorry.

31:57.749 --> 32:01.618
[Alex]<i> He's always kind of
been not in the best of health.</i>

32:01.653 --> 32:05.555
And um, it was
my biggest fear...

32:05.590 --> 32:08.158
was that he wouldn't be able
to give me away.

32:10.361 --> 32:12.029
And now he can't.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.266
[sniffing] Now I'm just
thinking about him, and it's...

32:17.769 --> 32:19.903
It's bringing up
a lot of emotions.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.238
I haven't even tried
the dress on yet.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.472
So this is silly but...

32:22.507 --> 32:24.308
Oh, my gosh!

32:24.342 --> 32:26.944
[Alex]
<i>A huge part of me is gone.</i>

32:28.446 --> 32:29.746
But that James got to know him,

32:29.781 --> 32:32.215
and loved him and they
loved each other...

32:33.584 --> 32:35.585
And he got to ask him
permission to marry me,

32:35.620 --> 32:38.088
so I... always have that.

32:38.423 --> 32:39.957
[sniffles]

32:41.426 --> 32:42.759
[chuckles softly, sniffles]

32:42.794 --> 32:45.095
He's just not gonna get to see
me in my dress...

32:45.530 --> 32:47.264
and give me away.

32:48.866 --> 32:51.501
Okay, I just have to try it on
and then...

32:51.536 --> 32:53.804
maybe I'll feel better.
[chuckles]

32:53.838 --> 32:56.273
[Alex]<i> If this is how</i>
<i>I'm feeling right now,</i>

32:56.307 --> 32:57.641
this has to be it!

32:57.675 --> 32:59.843
- Okay, we gotta get it in.
- Uh, if I try this on and it's not--

32:59.877 --> 33:02.379
We hyped it up then
you're gonna be like,

33:02.413 --> 33:03.613
"Oh, womp-womp."

33:03.648 --> 33:05.349
Yeah, I want it.
I just want to put it on.

33:05.383 --> 33:07.384
- Okay, let's do this.
- Okay, yes!

33:14.759 --> 33:17.461
Okay, I just have to try it on
and then,

33:17.495 --> 33:18.862
maybe I'll feel better.
[chuckles]

33:19.831 --> 33:21.565
[Alex]<i> If this is how</i>
<i>I'm feeling right now,</i>

33:21.599 --> 33:23.400
this has to be it!

33:23.434 --> 33:25.402
- We're doing this!
- Okay!

33:25.436 --> 33:26.970
So, I've never had a bride

33:27.005 --> 33:30.407
get emotional like this before
she's even been in the dress.

33:30.441 --> 33:32.743
So, I'm getting
a little bit nervous,

33:32.777 --> 33:34.511
<i>because I hope that when
she steps in it</i>

33:34.545 --> 33:36.813
<i>she still feels the same way.</i>

33:36.848 --> 33:38.348
[Krissy] Look at you! Aw!

33:39.283 --> 33:40.384
Wow!

33:42.754 --> 33:43.987
[sniffles]

33:44.022 --> 33:47.357
- You look so beautiful.
- I wanna marry James in this dress.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.561
It's like James... Like,
I can't put my finger on it.

33:51.596 --> 33:52.796
<i>But it's right.</i>

33:52.830 --> 33:55.599
And I didn't think a dress
could make you feel that way.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.134
But it can. [chuckles]

33:57.168 --> 34:00.037
If Allyson doesn't like this,
she better lie to me. [chuckles]

34:00.705 --> 34:03.707
Allyson, um, is the person...

34:03.741 --> 34:06.276
<i>that I look to, to be like,
"Is this it?"</i>

34:10.381 --> 34:12.649
Oh! Aw!

34:12.683 --> 34:14.985
Okay, wait. I don't wanna fall.

34:21.292 --> 34:22.959
[sniffles]

34:26.497 --> 34:28.198
Oh man!

34:29.534 --> 34:32.302
- I'm such a loser. [chuckles]
- Aw!

34:34.472 --> 34:36.073
[chuckles]

34:38.509 --> 34:40.510
- Yeah!
- Yep!

34:40.545 --> 34:43.380
[Allyson]<i> Alex cracking open</i>
<i>emotionally in this dress,</i>

34:43.414 --> 34:46.483
tells me... this is it!

34:46.517 --> 34:48.151
How are you feeling, Alex?

34:49.287 --> 34:50.387
[laughs]

34:51.122 --> 34:52.122
Um...

34:52.156 --> 34:53.423
I'm feeling a lot.

34:54.592 --> 34:55.725
I feel really beautiful.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.527
And I feel this is my dress.
[chuckles softly]

34:57.562 --> 34:59.563
- Feel it, do you...?
- Yes.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.798
[Alex]<i> I'm feeling...</i>

35:02.166 --> 35:04.568
everything.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.737
- It's just a dress. Like, what's happening?
- It's not just...

35:07.772 --> 35:10.974
It's not just a dress, you're
marrying the love of your life.

35:11.008 --> 35:13.743
You're also dealing with
the loss of your father.

35:13.778 --> 35:17.547
You can't put it in words.
That dress is magic.

35:17.582 --> 35:20.016
Are you ready to see yourself
in a veil?

35:20.051 --> 35:23.120
- Yeah, I think we need to try
a-- - May be something in the hair.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.387
Try a veil.

35:24.422 --> 35:27.491
So, James has a lot of pressure
on him because I was like,

35:27.525 --> 35:29.459
<i>"I want tears."</i>

35:29.494 --> 35:31.495
And he's like,
"I'm as cold as ice."

35:31.529 --> 35:32.796
And I'm like, "Mmm-mmm."

35:32.830 --> 35:36.433
"I'm gonna break you." And I
think this dress is gonna get him.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.569
[Krissy] All right, I know. It's
the veil. The veil makes it real.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.538
It's immediate.

35:41.572 --> 35:43.340
- It's immediate.
- Yes!

35:44.775 --> 35:47.511
- Wow!
- [Allyson] Oh, my God, Alex!

35:47.545 --> 35:48.879
This is absolutely stunning.

35:49.947 --> 35:53.617
- You're a picture-perfect bride.
- Aw, thank you.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.254
- I mean, what do you say when you find the dress.
- The perfect dress.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.456
So beautiful! Well...

35:59.490 --> 36:02.125
you know how we do it here
at Kleinfeld.

36:03.461 --> 36:04.694
- Alex?
- Yeah?

36:04.729 --> 36:08.064
[both] Are you saying
yes to the dress?

36:08.566 --> 36:10.100
Hell, yes!

36:10.134 --> 36:12.269
[whooping]

36:12.303 --> 36:13.436
[chuckles]

36:13.471 --> 36:16.573
[Alex]<i> It's everything that</i>
<i>they said it would be.</i>

36:16.607 --> 36:18.175
<i>And as soon as
I saw that dress...</i>

36:19.644 --> 36:21.344
Game over! That was it!

36:21.379 --> 36:22.412
That was my dress.

36:23.581 --> 36:26.483
<i>I'm a little shocked at what
I picked out but it's...</i>

36:26.517 --> 36:28.251
<i>It's perfect!</i>

36:28.286 --> 36:30.287
- It's perfect.
- It's so perfect!

36:31.422 --> 36:33.490
<i>I'm gonna take today
with me forever.</i>

36:33.524 --> 36:35.425
<i>And I think that,
that's really awesome.</i>

36:36.260 --> 36:37.227
[chuckles softly]

36:37.461 --> 36:39.062
Mmm.

36:39.096 --> 36:40.197
[chuckles]

36:40.231 --> 36:42.265
- No! [laughs]
- Hi!

36:42.300 --> 36:43.767
- Never. Aw!
- I love you!

36:43.801 --> 36:46.970
I love you!
I'm not crying, you're crying.

36:50.474 --> 36:52.642
[Jennifer] Oh, my God,
I hope this thing fits.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.412
<i>I don't know why that would be
a thing but that's...</i>

36:55.446 --> 36:56.646
I guess what
I'm most nervous about,

36:56.681 --> 36:59.783
<i>that it's not going to fit
even though I lost 50 pounds.</i>

36:59.817 --> 37:03.253
I can't wait to see, um, how
much actually they pulled in.

37:03.287 --> 37:04.554
Ready?

37:04.589 --> 37:06.890
[Jennifer]<i> Is this thing even
gonna fit? I don't even know.</i>

37:07.792 --> 37:10.160
[Lorena] I can already see
that it's big.

37:10.194 --> 37:12.295
We're gonna have to take
it in a little bit.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.663
Yeah, I can feel it here.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.298
Definitely a lot looser.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.367
[chuckles]
That makes me excited!

37:17.401 --> 37:18.768
[laughs] For sure!

37:18.803 --> 37:21.204
Hi, ladies!
Are you ready for your bride?

37:21.439 --> 37:22.806
Yes!

37:23.174 --> 37:25.475
Oh, my God!

37:25.509 --> 37:28.612
- Jen, it looks so good!
- Oh! It's so pretty!

37:28.646 --> 37:30.113
[Jordan] That is amazing.

37:30.147 --> 37:33.116
- I know it feels, it feels
awesome. And it's-- - Oh, my gosh!

37:33.517 --> 37:35.085
Oh, my goodness.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.387
- They're gonna have to take so much.
- It's definitely loose.

37:37.421 --> 37:38.555
These aren't in the right spot.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.590
It's still shocking to hear

37:40.625 --> 37:42.826
when other people make
comments about you,

37:42.860 --> 37:44.861
"Wow! Oh, my God, I can
tell, like, you lost weight."

37:44.895 --> 37:48.632
<i>I was like, "Really?" You know,
you're still kind of have like two...</i>

37:48.666 --> 37:51.034
two voices going on
in your head, right?

37:51.068 --> 37:52.636
The positive one
and the negative one.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.838
- Wow!
- Oh, goodness.

37:54.872 --> 37:55.939
Luis is gonna lose it.

37:55.973 --> 37:58.575
- That's all I gotta say, he's
gonna see-- - You think?

37:58.609 --> 38:00.977
I wanna see that guy cry.
[chuckles]

38:01.545 --> 38:03.513
My fiancÃ©'s name is Luis.

38:03.547 --> 38:07.017
<i>I've been with him now for
over ten years,</i>

38:07.585 --> 38:08.918
<i>which is kind of crazy.</i>

38:08.953 --> 38:12.656
<i>So, it's about time. I'm
ready definitely to get married,</i>

38:12.690 --> 38:14.958
<i>to have everything kind
of fall into place.</i>

38:15.593 --> 38:17.427
So, I had an original plan,

38:17.461 --> 38:19.429
back when I first got engaged.

38:19.463 --> 38:21.264
<i>Now, my plan is</i>

38:21.299 --> 38:23.733
<i>to actually elope in Vegas.</i>

38:23.768 --> 38:25.535
<i>It's just going to be
very small, only,</i>

38:25.569 --> 38:28.338
<i>my mom, stepdad and sister
are going to be there.</i>

38:28.372 --> 38:29.673
<i>And then I'll have
another ceremony</i>

38:29.707 --> 38:32.475
with everyone in attendance,
so I get to wear my dress twice.

38:32.510 --> 38:33.677
I'm excited about that.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.011
- You look beautiful!
- Right?

38:35.046 --> 38:38.581
Wow! It's gonna look even
better after we do all the work.

38:38.616 --> 38:40.650
- Wow!
- Goodness.

38:40.685 --> 38:43.019
To see it being pulled back,

38:43.287 --> 38:44.387
um...

38:44.422 --> 38:45.588
<i>I just... I'm like, wow!</i>

38:45.623 --> 38:48.992
I can definitely see
a difference in myself.

38:49.593 --> 38:51.594
You lost, uh, four inches

38:51.629 --> 38:53.663
on your waist and your hips.

38:53.698 --> 38:55.865
And four and
a half on your bust.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.734
So, that's a big difference.

38:57.768 --> 39:01.204
- That is exciting.
- That's awesome.

39:01.238 --> 39:02.439
That is so good.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.808
Oh, my God!

39:04.842 --> 39:07.977
I couldn't be more proud
and you just...

39:09.246 --> 39:10.613
You know...

39:10.648 --> 39:13.083
All the steps you took
to get here, to do this.

39:13.718 --> 39:16.252
Proud of you. Happy for you.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.454
Thanks, Mom.

39:17.488 --> 39:19.255
[chuckles] I love you!

39:20.224 --> 39:21.358
Love you too.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.593
I feel proud of Jen
all the time.

39:23.627 --> 39:25.295
<i>She's a beautiful girl.</i>

39:25.329 --> 39:27.330
<i>Well, she's beautiful
on the inside, too.</i>

39:27.365 --> 39:28.998
<i>She's such a good person.</i>

39:29.367 --> 39:30.500
It's just...

39:30.534 --> 39:32.602
amazing to see her
like this, like,

39:32.636 --> 39:37.040
<i>glowing and feeling
so confident and happy.</i>

39:38.376 --> 39:40.577
[Jennifer]<i> I do love it.</i>
<i>It's... amazing.</i>

39:40.611 --> 39:42.645
<i>It doesn't compare
to any other dress.</i>

39:42.680 --> 39:44.347
<i>You know... I mean...</i>

39:44.382 --> 39:45.815
<i>You have to wear one to know.</i>

39:45.850 --> 39:47.951
<i>Hundred percent ready
to get married.</i>
