WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.489
We're throwing a wedding for
my wife's friend from New York.

00:02.651 --> 00:04.359
But you don't really care about that.

00:04.384 --> 00:05.773
- Thank you so much.
- Sure thing.

00:05.798 --> 00:07.829
Honey, I think we need to
really just start organizing

00:07.853 --> 00:09.415
- some of this inventory because...
- Sure, sure.

00:09.439 --> 00:11.615
... you know, Sierra's just
got a very specific vision

00:11.640 --> 00:13.218
of what she wants, and I just...

00:13.243 --> 00:15.289
I-I do want it to be perfect.

00:15.314 --> 00:16.929
How much are we spending on this?

00:16.954 --> 00:18.524
Oh, we're not...
We're not spending. Yeah.

00:18.548 --> 00:19.782
- We're not?
- Sh... No, no. She's paying

00:19.806 --> 00:21.836
for all of it, and she's
actually giving us a little...

00:21.860 --> 00:23.001
little bit of cheddar on the top.

00:23.025 --> 00:24.290
I don't hate that, because, you know,

00:24.314 --> 00:25.672
- we could use the money.
- That's why we're trying to... Yeah.

00:25.696 --> 00:27.415
If she wants to spend a
bundle on white tablecloths,

00:27.439 --> 00:28.809
- God bless her.
- White? Are they white?

00:28.833 --> 00:30.390
Yeah, it's white... White tablecloth.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.765
Okay.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.961
They're light cream. Thank God.
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

00:33.985 --> 00:35.835
Okay, let's see what we got in here.

00:35.860 --> 00:39.734
Oh, my goodness!
We've got a light cream bunny.

00:39.759 --> 00:41.064
Those should be white.

00:41.089 --> 00:42.844
Those are white.
Oh, you're messing with me now.

00:42.868 --> 00:44.696
- I'm messing with you to keep it light.
- Okay. Yep.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.781
Hey, guys.

00:45.806 --> 00:47.180
I finished folding all the napkins.

00:47.204 --> 00:49.421
But I-I think that you're
kind of wasting my strength.

00:49.446 --> 00:50.531
I mean, I'm very strong.

00:50.556 --> 00:52.913
You know what you could do
is do some ironing for me.

00:52.938 --> 00:54.290
- Yeah, you'd be great at that.
- I need you to do some ironing.

00:54.314 --> 00:55.929
Yeah. Give me
the heaviest iron you have.

00:55.954 --> 00:56.955
- Great. That's awesome.
- Great job.

00:56.979 --> 00:58.711
Oh, my God, Mike, she's here.
She's here! She's here.

00:58.735 --> 01:00.031
Look who's here! Oh, my God.

01:00.056 --> 01:02.164
- Bonjour and shalom, bitch!
- Oh, my God.

01:02.189 --> 01:04.742
- Woman!
- I'm getting married!

01:10.142 --> 01:12.382
I don't even know what
they're talking about.

01:12.407 --> 01:13.633
Do you think they're talking about me?

01:13.657 --> 01:15.156
- I do.
- No, that wouldn't make sense, right?

01:15.180 --> 01:16.657
- No, I think they are.
- You think they are?

01:16.681 --> 01:17.856
Yeah, your strength.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.291
Right. So, this is
what I was thinking...

01:29.315 --> 01:30.500
That we'd line up guests here

01:30.525 --> 01:32.532
and they would sort
of sage you and Lars.

01:32.557 --> 01:33.797
Saging's a little bit basic.

01:33.822 --> 01:35.297
Y-Yeah. Yeah, that is basic.

01:35.322 --> 01:36.705
So, maybe we won't do that, but like...

01:36.729 --> 01:38.313
But I feel like no one's basic anymore.

01:38.338 --> 01:39.594
- Yeah.
- Like, let's be basic.

01:39.619 --> 01:41.134
Yeah, and so, I was thinking
we should be basic.

01:41.158 --> 01:42.594
- And so... Yeah.
- God.

01:42.619 --> 01:45.407
I mean, this place, it's just so...

01:45.432 --> 01:46.993
It... It's like...

01:47.018 --> 01:48.314
- ... real.
- ... real.

01:48.339 --> 01:49.539
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:49.564 --> 01:51.784
And, like, he's so...

01:51.943 --> 01:53.244
American and cool.

01:53.269 --> 01:54.749
- Oh, yeah.
- Jacob. I'm Jacob.

01:54.774 --> 01:56.252
Jacob, I love your outfit.

01:56.277 --> 01:58.308
- Ja... What... What's happening?
- It's Jacob.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.357
You can just go with it.

01:59.381 --> 02:00.980
- And this is Rudy.
- Oh, my God.

02:01.005 --> 02:02.652
- Oh, my God.
- Rudy, this is Sierra.

02:02.677 --> 02:04.558
I think that you are the unkempt man

02:04.583 --> 02:05.637
who lives in the barn, right?

02:05.661 --> 02:07.488
You're the littlest person
I've ever met.

02:07.513 --> 02:09.449
- It's an honor.
- Okay, total sidebar...

02:09.473 --> 02:12.175
Can I just say you
have an exquisite body?

02:12.742 --> 02:13.742
You may.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.355
I'm so glad someone finally said it.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.433
I've been thinking it
the whole time here.

02:17.458 --> 02:18.938
- Guys.
- Hey.

02:18.963 --> 02:22.316
Okay, this is the local ensemble team

02:22.341 --> 02:24.090
that is going to bring
your wedding to fruition,

02:24.114 --> 02:26.019
and this is Sierra.

02:26.044 --> 02:28.855
I am absolutely teeming with gratitude

02:28.880 --> 02:30.273
for your guidance and nourishment

02:30.298 --> 02:32.347
as I make this transition
into my married life.

02:32.372 --> 02:33.403
- Yeah.
- You know,

02:33.428 --> 02:35.520
my dear friend Marianne Williamson

02:35.545 --> 02:37.528
just said some wise words to me...

02:37.553 --> 02:38.911
"Love is like a book,

02:38.936 --> 02:41.543
and I appreciate you helping
me writing this next chapter."

02:41.568 --> 02:43.372
- That's really sweet.
- Oh, wow.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.661
This is why she's the best, you guys.

02:46.263 --> 02:47.856
I follow you on Instagram.

02:47.881 --> 02:49.536
You never respond to my messages.

02:49.561 --> 02:51.715
Oh, I don't handle my messages.

02:51.740 --> 02:53.271
You have to talk to Katsana about that.

02:53.295 --> 02:54.848
Oh. Um, okay.

02:54.873 --> 02:57.180
So, let's just do introductions.
Obviously, I'm Rio.

02:57.205 --> 02:59.145
I'm the best friend.
I'm the wedding planner.

02:59.170 --> 03:01.489
- I'm whatever... mother of pigs.
- She does it all.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.287
Should we... Do you want to...
Clara, do you want to...

03:03.311 --> 03:06.444
Um, I'm Clara. I am a Pisces,

03:06.469 --> 03:09.217
and I will be making your
22-tiered wedding cake.

03:09.242 --> 03:11.155
Oh. Um, did you...

03:11.180 --> 03:13.413
So, 20 two-tiered cakes.

03:13.438 --> 03:14.531
Yeah, we're saying the same thing.

03:14.555 --> 03:17.030
I don't think we are.
So... What did you say?

03:17.055 --> 03:20.811
- Twenty two...
- 22-tiered wedding cake.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.381
Great. Okay.

03:23.406 --> 03:24.827
And Jacob, you're on decor.

03:24.852 --> 03:27.226
You're gonna be doing the
thousand origami cranes.

03:27.414 --> 03:30.296
If all I can do is fold paper,
how come this?

03:30.597 --> 03:32.678
But you're good for origami cranes?

03:32.703 --> 03:34.007
Yeah, yeah. I can fold the cranes.

03:34.031 --> 03:35.554
Okay. Um, alright.

03:35.579 --> 03:36.956
Here's another thing that
we should discuss,

03:36.980 --> 03:38.514
which is the father-daughter dance.

03:38.539 --> 03:39.758
Like, what do you want to do?

03:39.783 --> 03:40.968
It's obviously a unique situation.

03:40.992 --> 03:43.116
You have two dads... Daddy and Pop-Pop.

03:43.141 --> 03:45.535
Like, do you want to dance
with them at the same time?

03:45.560 --> 03:46.952
You know what? I am feeling...

03:46.977 --> 03:49.405
I'm feeling a little deluged right now.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.436
- Okay.
- You know?

03:50.461 --> 03:52.069
Why don't we open a bottle of champagne?

03:52.094 --> 03:53.545
Sure. And so...

03:53.570 --> 03:56.178
I feel like we should, like,
finish the meeting first, right?

03:56.203 --> 03:57.491
And then we can do champagne?

03:57.516 --> 04:01.116
Ooh, sounds like Rio's putting
the "snore" in "Bucksnort."

04:05.328 --> 04:07.217
- She got... That's...
- Okay, okay.

04:07.242 --> 04:08.475
- Very funny.
- I love it.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.037
- I love it.
- She's very funny.

04:10.062 --> 04:12.764
Oh, hey, Brandon,
where do you guys keep cannons

04:12.789 --> 04:14.303
for shooting, like, rose petals?

04:14.328 --> 04:16.504
Come on, man.
We don't even have shampoo.

04:16.529 --> 04:17.616
- Oh.
- Brandon!

04:17.641 --> 04:19.709
Is that Mike? I need to talk to him.

04:19.733 --> 04:22.616
Hey, bud, be careful.
She is on a war path right now.

04:22.641 --> 04:25.084
She already ticketed three
people for jaywalking.

04:25.109 --> 04:26.428
We don't even have a crosswalk.

04:26.453 --> 04:27.975
- Okay, okay.
- Mike.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.131
I noticed that you placed a
very large order of alcohol.

04:31.156 --> 04:32.843
Now, you know you can't
serve that at a wedding...

04:32.867 --> 04:34.116
... without a liquor license.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.546
We don't need a license for that, do we?

04:35.570 --> 04:37.233
I mean, it's... It's not on my list.

04:37.258 --> 04:38.702
- Let me see that.
- Well, you know,

04:38.727 --> 04:39.889
I need that back. Okay?

04:39.914 --> 04:41.507
So, you're having the
wedding at Rudy's barn?

04:41.531 --> 04:42.553
Is he okay with that?

04:42.578 --> 04:43.750
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They... They're not

04:43.774 --> 04:44.959
speaking right now.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.881
- Oh.
- Okay, we got butterflies... no.

04:46.906 --> 04:48.366
Fireworks... nope.

04:48.391 --> 04:50.077
I'm denying your wedding permit.

04:50.102 --> 04:52.108
Wait, did we even apply for a permit?

04:52.133 --> 04:53.233
No. Would you like one?

04:53.258 --> 04:54.444
Uh... sure.

04:54.469 --> 04:55.959
Denied!

04:57.843 --> 04:59.358
Okay, so, this clearly

04:59.383 --> 05:00.709
has something to do with the breakup.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.545
- 100%. Definitely.
- Yeah.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.875
But I'm not gonna be
the one to tell her.

05:03.899 --> 05:05.156
- Are you kidding me?
- Listen, I can't have

05:05.180 --> 05:07.295
your mom on full tilt for this wedding.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.538
So, we've got to figure out

05:08.563 --> 05:10.398
how to cool things down
between Constance and Rudy.

05:10.422 --> 05:11.506
Yeah, we... we just got to

05:11.531 --> 05:12.851
figure out a way to break
the seal, right?

05:12.875 --> 05:14.789
- Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
- Create some conversation.

05:14.813 --> 05:17.131
- There we go.
- Help them move past this.

05:17.156 --> 05:18.609
Yes, and we got to fast-track it.

05:18.633 --> 05:19.889
Brandon, watch the register.

05:19.914 --> 05:21.803
- I'm gonna go tase someone.
- Alright.

05:21.828 --> 05:22.992
Theresa, I know I've been getting

05:23.016 --> 05:25.077
a lot of comments on my body lately,

05:25.102 --> 05:26.959
but I'd appreciate your brutal honesty.

05:27.518 --> 05:29.624
- You're just jealous.
- Hey.

05:29.649 --> 05:31.811
Rudy, I-I was hoping to talk to you

05:31.836 --> 05:33.670
for a second about Constance.

05:33.695 --> 05:34.772
We had a clean break.

05:34.797 --> 05:36.538
Cold turkey's the only
way to stop anything.

05:36.563 --> 05:38.420
Six years ago,
I stopped making left turns.

05:38.445 --> 05:39.639
Haven't done one since.

05:39.664 --> 05:40.834
So, h-how then do you...

05:40.859 --> 05:42.733
- Three rights, Mike.
- Fascinating.

05:42.821 --> 05:46.491
Uh, just to bring it back
to Connie, she...

05:47.152 --> 05:50.590
asked i-if she could
get a recipe from you.

05:50.615 --> 05:53.052
What recipe? She knows
the only thing I make is trail mix.

05:53.077 --> 05:56.178
Uh-huh. She wants to know your
peanut-to-almond proportions.

05:56.203 --> 05:57.686
So, uh, she's on her way...

05:57.711 --> 05:59.334
- On her way now?
- Yeah. She'll be here.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.350
- On her way.
- Maybe we could regroup

06:00.375 --> 06:01.397
in, like, 30 minutes?

06:01.422 --> 06:03.757
Great. I look forward to
telling her my nut ratio.

06:05.828 --> 06:07.092
Yeah. It's just...

06:07.117 --> 06:09.014
You have a weird smile on your face.

06:09.039 --> 06:10.655
- No, I really don't.
- Okay.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.703
Well, look...

06:11.727 --> 06:14.350
I've got to find a place to
rent a chuppah in Nebraska,

06:14.375 --> 06:16.616
which is quite a challenge,
but I'll see you shortly?

06:16.641 --> 06:18.194
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:19.459 --> 06:21.452
Wait, Rio, do you remember
when we threw the rave

06:21.477 --> 06:23.328
in the Meatpacking District,
and I got salmonella?

06:23.352 --> 06:26.186
- How could I forget?
- Oh, my God. We were rolling so hard.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.516
It was ridiculous.

06:27.541 --> 06:29.577
My God, are you guys
talking about drugs?

06:29.602 --> 06:31.756
I lost my virginity on Ibuprofen.

06:31.781 --> 06:33.522
Ooh. Did you wait for it to kick in?

06:33.547 --> 06:35.006
I didn't think of that.

06:35.031 --> 06:36.405
Are you guys carrying right now?

06:36.430 --> 06:39.374
Because, like, if you were
to totally peer-pressure me,

06:39.399 --> 06:40.741
- I would do it.
- We're not doing drugs.

06:40.765 --> 06:42.990
Okay, well, look,
if you want to get a little loopy...

06:43.015 --> 06:44.444
I have got some horse tranquilizers.

06:44.468 --> 06:45.912
- Oh, my God. Kent.
- Ooh.

06:45.937 --> 06:48.850
Kent coming in hot with suggestions.

06:49.233 --> 06:50.843
You're not gonna like
how they're administered.

06:50.867 --> 06:52.505
Horse tranquilizers... Oh, wait.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.326
- Hey.
- What do you have?

06:54.351 --> 06:57.061
I have wedding planning. Come on.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.631
Can we focus on that later?

07:01.728 --> 07:03.412
Come on, Rio. You really have changed.

07:03.437 --> 07:04.718
I mean, I'm telling you,
she used to be fun.

07:04.742 --> 07:05.895
Now it's just like...

07:05.919 --> 07:07.311
You know? It's like downhill.

07:07.336 --> 07:09.056
- Like, what happened?
- I'm still fun.

07:09.526 --> 07:10.993
- No.
- I still have fun.

07:11.018 --> 07:13.236
I throw down. I throw down a lot.

07:13.261 --> 07:17.415
If you throw down,
why don't we throw a par-tay tonight?

07:17.440 --> 07:18.964
- Oh.
- Like we used to, right?

07:18.989 --> 07:20.861
- Yeah, yeah.
- Totally debauched bacchanal.

07:20.886 --> 07:24.095
- Oh, here? Here?
- Like a full-blown rave.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.907
- What do you think? Are you down?
- I think... I think yes. Yes!

07:26.932 --> 07:28.603
Yes! Right?

07:29.959 --> 07:32.266
- Annihilation!
- Yes!

07:32.291 --> 07:34.307
- Take it down, take it down!
- There we go. There's the Rio I know!

07:34.331 --> 07:37.454
Yes! Yes! Get it! Yes, yes, yes!

07:37.479 --> 07:38.931
- Mm!
- Oh. Are you okay?

07:38.956 --> 07:39.993
It's just... Uh... Th...

07:40.018 --> 07:41.782
There's a lot more in
there than I imagined.

07:41.807 --> 07:44.581
Brandon said that Rudy
wanted me to meet him here

07:44.606 --> 07:45.956
because of what?

07:45.981 --> 07:46.986
W-What again?

07:47.011 --> 07:48.970
He saw a large naked man walking by,

07:48.995 --> 07:50.867
and he made a citizen's arrest,

07:50.892 --> 07:53.415
but the man escaped because
he was covered in oil,

07:53.440 --> 07:56.162
and now Rudy wants
to do a police sketch.

07:56.664 --> 07:58.280
That's too much. That's way too much.

07:58.304 --> 07:59.311
W-W-Wait, wait, wait.

07:59.336 --> 08:01.732
He said he was gonna
be waiting for me here?

08:01.757 --> 08:02.929
Is that what you... I don't see him.

08:02.953 --> 08:04.351
That... That could be my fault.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.733
I-I might have got the time wrong.

08:05.757 --> 08:07.194
But I'm sure he just
stepped out for a second.

08:07.218 --> 08:08.219
- He'll be right back.
- Yeah.

08:08.243 --> 08:10.170
You know,
this is such a waste of my time.

08:10.195 --> 08:12.428
I could have been
setting up a speed trap.

08:12.460 --> 08:14.780
This is so stupid.

08:14.805 --> 08:16.323
What the hell, Mike?

08:16.348 --> 08:18.666
Come on. I held up
my end of the bargain.

08:20.207 --> 08:21.807
What's this? W-What is it...

08:21.832 --> 08:23.917
What do you got on
your neck here, Theresa?

08:26.143 --> 08:27.706
Okay...

08:27.731 --> 08:30.159
"Sorry, but I can't talk to Constance.

08:30.184 --> 08:34.073
I've gone into my underground bunker...

08:34.097 --> 08:37.222
for two to five years,
depending on how hungry I am.

08:37.246 --> 08:40.025
Please take care of Theresa,
and don't try to find me.

08:40.049 --> 08:42.197
Love, Rudy."

08:42.222 --> 08:43.361
And then, I don't know,

08:43.385 --> 08:46.781
eight pages of goat care instructions.

08:46.828 --> 08:48.511
"Drain glands at least three"...

08:48.536 --> 08:50.793
No. No, no, no.
I'm not draining any glands.

08:50.818 --> 08:52.667
No, Mike. We made this worse.

08:52.692 --> 08:54.589
Oh, hell yeah. Yeah,
it's much, much worse.

08:54.614 --> 08:55.897
We have to find that bunker.

08:56.819 --> 08:59.022
And it's good!

08:59.047 --> 09:00.478
- Hey.
- Hey. Can I um...

09:00.503 --> 09:02.509
clear some of this off,
whatever that is?

09:02.925 --> 09:04.274
Yeah. Whatever.

09:04.299 --> 09:05.439
Ow!

09:05.837 --> 09:07.275
Aah. I'm bleeding.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.282
Aah, I guess paper really
does beat... rock.

09:10.307 --> 09:12.743
Make sure you are banging
back some electrolytes, okay?

09:12.768 --> 09:14.209
- Yeah.
- You're doing a lot of flexing.

09:14.233 --> 09:15.443
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:15.468 --> 09:16.873
- Holy smokes.
- Whoa.

09:16.898 --> 09:18.013
Who's the lucky guy?

09:18.038 --> 09:20.763
Me? Is it me? No, I know.

09:20.788 --> 09:21.795
No, no. Okay.

09:21.820 --> 09:24.974
So, Sierra called me a "Buck-Snore"...

09:25.413 --> 09:26.943
... and I mildly overreacted,

09:26.968 --> 09:30.538
and now we're throwing a small,
but intimate rave in the barn.

09:30.563 --> 09:32.360
And I hope Rudy doesn't mind,
which I don't think he will.

09:32.384 --> 09:33.580
- Do you think he'll mind?
- I don't think he'll mind.

09:33.604 --> 09:36.959
He is underground in his bunker
somewhere on our property.

09:36.984 --> 09:38.615
- He what? He's in... He's in a what?
- So I'm I'm trying to locate him.

09:38.639 --> 09:40.183
Don't worry about it.
You know, worst-case scenario,

09:40.207 --> 09:41.403
we'll just... we'll cancel the wedding.

09:41.427 --> 09:42.767
We'll be able to see
Rudy in two to five years.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.955
What? You... What do
you mean the wedding is not...

09:44.980 --> 09:46.808
- That's, like...
- Brandon and I are on it.

09:46.833 --> 09:47.916
- Okay, so just...
- Okay. 'Cause, yeah,

09:47.940 --> 09:49.174
- enjoy your rave, honey.
- I'm trying to, like...

09:49.198 --> 09:50.635
- Okay. Phew.
- You can get blackout drunk

09:50.659 --> 09:52.513
- and earn Sierra's respect back, but...
- Oh, well...

09:52.537 --> 09:54.084
Watch out for Connie.
She's on the war path.

09:54.108 --> 09:55.748
Well, nothing ever crazy
happens in this town,

09:55.772 --> 09:56.904
so I think I'm good.

09:58.000 --> 10:04.074

10:05.007 --> 10:07.419
- Hey!
- Rio!

10:07.834 --> 10:09.443
What a dope milieu!

10:09.468 --> 10:10.768
Yes.

10:10.963 --> 10:12.684
Yeah, so dope!

10:12.709 --> 10:14.591
So dope! I love it!

10:14.616 --> 10:17.272
Rio, everyone has hands!

10:17.297 --> 10:19.473
- We...
- We all have hands!

10:19.498 --> 10:21.195
Yeah!

10:21.524 --> 10:23.498
I did drugs!

10:27.266 --> 10:28.350
- Rio!
- Oh, hi.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.911
I just saw Rudy crawling
on the ground like a cat.

10:30.936 --> 10:33.084
What are you chewing?
Clara, what are you chewing?

10:33.109 --> 10:34.327
I told you not to chew any
more of those gummies.

10:34.351 --> 10:35.484
Are you chewing those gummies?

10:35.508 --> 10:36.787
- Clara.
- Oh, I should take my top off.

10:36.811 --> 10:37.873
No, I didn't say that.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.569
You know what? Just stay with me here.

10:39.594 --> 10:41.061
Now hold. Look at this hand.

10:41.086 --> 10:43.381
Stay with me. You're watching my fist.

10:43.413 --> 10:45.560
You're watching my fi... Water.

10:45.585 --> 10:47.928
- Wow!
- Go and take it outside.

10:47.953 --> 10:49.623
This is awesome.

10:49.648 --> 10:51.076
Oh, God. Hello.

10:51.101 --> 10:53.514
Yes. Hi. Who is that guy?

10:53.539 --> 10:55.366
I think he follows me on Insta.

10:55.391 --> 10:57.639
- And that got him here somehow?
- Eh, you know what?

10:57.664 --> 11:00.826
I posted about the barn,
so maybe he saw my location tag.

11:00.851 --> 11:02.026
Oh, wow.

11:02.594 --> 11:04.983
- Oh, that's...
- Oh, my God.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.873
- Come on, guys!
- I-I... Oh.

11:08.944 --> 11:10.991
Another cow bone.

11:11.016 --> 11:12.233
How many does that make?

11:12.258 --> 11:14.241
Enough to make nine full cows.

11:14.266 --> 11:15.485
Whoop, whoop!

11:15.510 --> 11:18.513
Get your hands in the
air and drop your bone!

11:19.327 --> 11:20.676
Hey, Ma.

11:20.701 --> 11:22.772
I was just helping Mike mow his land.

11:22.797 --> 11:26.014
Don't fix your mouth to lie when
I got a megaphone in my hand.

11:26.433 --> 11:27.889
What the hell is going on?

11:27.914 --> 11:30.176
Mike came up with some crazy idea

11:30.201 --> 11:31.897
about getting you and Rudy to talk.

11:31.922 --> 11:33.959
But I said, "No, Mike. That's not right.

11:33.984 --> 11:35.186
This is none of our business."

11:35.211 --> 11:36.584
I... W... Really?

11:36.609 --> 11:39.592
Yeah. Rudy went down into his bunker

11:39.617 --> 11:42.600
because I suggested that you
guys have a conversation.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.709
Rudy went into his bunker?

11:44.734 --> 11:46.662
Yes. D... Has he told you where it is?

11:46.687 --> 11:47.826
No, he didn't tell me.

11:47.851 --> 11:49.975
Don't worry, Mom. This is Mike's mess.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.217
Just Mike.

11:51.242 --> 11:52.334
But I'm-a help you fix it.

11:52.359 --> 11:54.319
You are such a good son, Brandon.

11:54.344 --> 11:55.370
We raised you right.

11:55.395 --> 11:57.311
But you, on the other hand...

11:57.336 --> 11:59.076
Why didn't you just leave us alone?

11:59.101 --> 12:01.248
Well, I would have loved
to have left you alone,

12:01.273 --> 12:03.655
but one of you lives in my barn

12:03.680 --> 12:05.108
and mopes around all day long,

12:05.133 --> 12:07.025
and then I bump into you,
and you've got a long face.

12:07.049 --> 12:08.659
So I know this isn't going so well,

12:08.684 --> 12:09.984
you cutting him out of your life.

12:10.008 --> 12:13.928
So, you're gonna force two
adults who just broke up

12:13.953 --> 12:15.037
to be friends

12:15.062 --> 12:17.631
so that you can get out of
getting a liquor license?

12:17.656 --> 12:19.647
When you phrase it that way, sure,

12:19.672 --> 12:21.350
it does sound a little insincere.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.225
I-It's just awkward between us.

12:23.250 --> 12:26.131
I-I don't even know how to
be friends with him again.

12:26.156 --> 12:27.655
Well, I do believe step one

12:27.680 --> 12:30.272
is extracting him
from beneath the earth.

12:30.297 --> 12:31.297
And then what?

12:31.322 --> 12:32.537
You take a little baby step,

12:32.562 --> 12:33.944
and then it leads to another,

12:33.969 --> 12:36.186
- and you move...
- Hey, I found something!

12:36.211 --> 12:37.842
Is it Rudy?

12:42.789 --> 12:45.264
S-Sierra, I wondered
if you could just make, like,

12:45.289 --> 12:46.638
a really chill announcement,

12:46.663 --> 12:49.006
just telling people
not to wreck the farm,

12:49.031 --> 12:51.381
mainly 'cause it's, like,
my livelihood or whatever,

12:51.406 --> 12:53.249
and, you know,
it just has gotten a little bit bigger

12:53.273 --> 12:55.145
than I initially thought it would.

12:55.170 --> 12:58.178
Look, I'm sorry for putting
the party on Instagram.

12:58.706 --> 13:01.256
I just wanted my family to
see me having a good time,

13:01.281 --> 13:02.593
and I thought they
would change their minds

13:02.617 --> 13:03.920
about not coming to the wedding.

13:03.945 --> 13:05.381
Uh, what?

13:05.406 --> 13:07.342
What do you mean, your family's
not coming to the wedding?

13:07.366 --> 13:09.150
Daddy totally despises Lars.

13:09.175 --> 13:10.686
Whatever. Do you want more moonshine?

13:10.711 --> 13:11.991
No, I don't want more moonshine.

13:12.016 --> 13:13.413
I want to talk to you about why Daddy

13:13.437 --> 13:14.515
doesn't want to come to your wedding.

13:14.539 --> 13:16.123
Yes, but Kent's about to jump

13:16.148 --> 13:17.889
from really high up for no reason.

13:17.914 --> 13:20.678
- Kent is what?
- Who wants to see me jump, baby?!

13:22.930 --> 13:25.320
No, no! Not... No, Kent!

13:25.345 --> 13:28.186
I need a landing zone!
Get that hay in here!

13:28.211 --> 13:29.444
Sierra, Sierra, listen.

13:29.469 --> 13:31.056
It's a really big deal,
what you're saying.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.984
I-I want to talk to you.
That's what I'm here for.

13:33.008 --> 13:34.507
- Look! over here!
- What is it?

13:34.531 --> 13:37.998
Oh, my God! Guys! Door in the floor!

13:38.023 --> 13:40.200
You're avoiding me right now.

13:40.225 --> 13:44.193
Door in the floor! Door in the floor!

13:53.609 --> 13:55.685
Barn man!

14:03.452 --> 14:05.341
What is it? More cow bones?

14:05.366 --> 14:07.709
It's Clarabones.

14:08.734 --> 14:10.740
Clara, are you okay, girl? What...

14:10.765 --> 14:12.599
Oh, yeah. I ate all these gummies,

14:12.624 --> 14:14.302
and then I saw Rudy
crawling in the barn,

14:14.327 --> 14:15.873
and then all these people showed up,

14:15.898 --> 14:18.292
- and I was like, "nap before orgy."
- W-W-Wait.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.466
- You saw Rudy?
- Yeah.

14:19.491 --> 14:21.058
- In the barn?
- You two dummies

14:21.083 --> 14:24.357
did not check underneath
Rudy's barn first?

14:25.027 --> 14:27.067
Wow, this is incredible.

14:30.038 --> 14:31.802
Oh, wow. Wow, wow, wow.

14:37.124 --> 14:39.302
Sierra, what is going on?

14:39.327 --> 14:40.999
Why is your family not
coming to your wedding?

14:41.023 --> 14:43.504
Oh, my God. Can you stop? I don't care.

14:43.529 --> 14:45.255
- Neither should you.
- I do care.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.064
I do care. You're hiding here.

14:47.089 --> 14:48.599
- I'm not hiding.
- You're not hiding?

14:48.624 --> 14:50.365
You're literally behind a bunch of cans

14:50.390 --> 14:51.607
in... in an underground bunker

14:51.632 --> 14:53.810
in the middle of Bucksnort, Nebraska.

14:53.835 --> 14:55.130
- I am fine.
- No.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.723
I am fine. Leave me alone.

14:57.748 --> 15:00.380
You say that you haven't changed,
but you really have.

15:00.405 --> 15:02.591
Yes. I have.

15:02.616 --> 15:03.623
I have changed.

15:03.648 --> 15:04.935
I admit that to you.

15:04.960 --> 15:08.167
I do not want to be in this
underground apocalypse bunker

15:08.192 --> 15:11.170
with a bunch of strangers from
the Internet that I don't know.

15:11.195 --> 15:13.677
Don't look at me like, "Oh,
yeah, I got you," okay?

15:13.702 --> 15:15.920
- There it is.
- I have a farm with my husband.

15:15.945 --> 15:17.146
Yes, we get it.

15:17.171 --> 15:18.865
You own a farm, and I'm just

15:18.890 --> 15:20.677
some dumb party girl from New York.

15:20.702 --> 15:21.951
Sierra, please don't do that.

15:21.976 --> 15:24.201
Excuse me. I'm gonna go get my swerve on

15:24.226 --> 15:26.505
and spank that sexy grandfather clock.

15:29.808 --> 15:32.865
Out of my way! Police business!

15:32.890 --> 15:35.076
Y'all are under arrest!

15:35.101 --> 15:38.061
What in God's name is going on here?

15:38.086 --> 15:39.154
Damn, Rudy!

15:39.179 --> 15:40.873
You all are under arrest,

15:40.898 --> 15:43.521
and your wedding ain't
never gonna happen.

15:43.546 --> 15:45.959
This might be bad timing, but Rudy...

15:45.984 --> 15:47.670
what a bunker!

15:49.766 --> 15:51.740
Alright, it's time for mugshots.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.560
Come on, Rudy.

15:57.411 --> 15:58.804
Great, great, great.

15:59.207 --> 16:01.035
- Great.
- Mm.

16:01.924 --> 16:04.099
I do find it beguiling
that this anteroom

16:04.124 --> 16:05.787
also serves as a penal holding facility.

16:05.812 --> 16:07.792
Oh, my goodness. Can't you
just say that it's cool

16:07.816 --> 16:09.845
- the room also serves as a jail cell?
- Mike...

16:09.870 --> 16:11.370
- ... that's not productive.
- Why do you got to be so hoity-toity...

16:11.394 --> 16:13.299
- ... to break the ice.
- Turn to the left

16:13.510 --> 16:15.315
So, Rudy, how long were you planning

16:15.340 --> 16:17.159
on staying in that damn bunker?

16:17.184 --> 16:18.925
Not sure. It depended on how well

16:18.950 --> 16:21.605
I responded to the taste
of thrice-filtered urine.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.323
And you were gonna stay down there

16:23.348 --> 16:25.034
just because I wanted to talk to you?

16:25.059 --> 16:27.120
Rudy, come on. We can't live like that.

16:27.145 --> 16:29.080
Don't worry.
I wouldn't have lasted long.

16:29.105 --> 16:31.182
Ate most of my snacks in the first hour.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.854
I'm powerless over peanut butter.

16:32.879 --> 16:34.448
Alright. Turn to the right.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.932
The only thing I missed about
the above ground world was you.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.744
Even if we're not speaking...

16:41.052 --> 16:42.955
it's nice to be on the
same side of the dirt.

16:42.980 --> 16:44.690
Well, Mike was trying to rope Brandon

16:44.715 --> 16:47.846
into making us friends again, but...

16:47.871 --> 16:49.682
we'll eventually get there.

16:49.922 --> 16:51.979
I'm just not ready for that yet.

16:52.004 --> 16:53.377
I agree.

16:53.402 --> 16:54.609
May I face you?

16:54.640 --> 16:56.307
Yes, go ahead.

16:57.324 --> 17:00.299
If only there was some way
I knew you were doing okay,

17:00.324 --> 17:02.346
but I didn't have to
see you all the time.

17:04.410 --> 17:06.930
Hope that doesn't mean I have to
join some kind of social media.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.593
Just...

17:19.013 --> 17:21.165
It's a police scanner.

17:21.191 --> 17:23.315
Just turn it on and listen.

17:23.339 --> 17:25.096
You'll hear my voice...

17:26.200 --> 17:29.549
and I'll know that you'll be
listening out there somewhere.

17:30.144 --> 17:32.073
This is wonderful.

17:32.196 --> 17:33.346
Ten-four.

17:33.371 --> 17:35.196
Copy that.

17:36.445 --> 17:38.321
Okay. You know what?

17:38.346 --> 17:40.665
I already tried to force two
other people together today.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.040
It did not go well.

17:42.065 --> 17:43.259
Might as well try it again.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.791
You guys... You can't do this.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.850
You can't do this. You're...
You're not even looking at each other,

17:48.874 --> 17:51.278
you're ignoring each other,
and you're old friends.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.218
Do you know how rare that is?

17:53.298 --> 17:54.659
Everyone changes,

17:54.684 --> 17:57.105
but only a few lucky people
get to have someone there

17:57.130 --> 17:58.740
that witnesses the whole thing.

17:58.765 --> 18:00.167
You want to lose that?

18:00.192 --> 18:04.683
You're gonna throw all that
away over some fatuous dispute?

18:05.859 --> 18:08.386
Oh, that's right, sister.
I know some long words, too.

18:08.919 --> 18:10.784
Don't do that.

18:15.237 --> 18:16.803
Sierra...

18:17.135 --> 18:18.722
back in the day,

18:18.747 --> 18:21.594
we would go out, and we'd... party

18:21.619 --> 18:24.404
and, like, hit on guys,
and it was fun, and...

18:24.682 --> 18:25.694
You know, but now...

18:25.719 --> 18:27.721
Yeah. I mean, we've changed.

18:27.746 --> 18:29.502
- Yeah.
- You're a farmer.

18:29.527 --> 18:30.852
I'm growing up.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.109
I'm getting married to a
guy 20 years older than me.

18:33.134 --> 18:34.467
- Yeah.
- Wow. 20... 20 years?

18:34.492 --> 18:36.710
Yeah. I love it.

18:36.754 --> 18:38.718
I actually wish he was older, like Rudy.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.609
- Sure.
- Rudy's a smoke-show,

18:40.634 --> 18:41.883
and I want a puff.

18:41.908 --> 18:43.156
Experience.

18:43.181 --> 18:47.320
I mean, I feel like just because
we change doesn't mean...

18:47.345 --> 18:50.586
you know,
we can't still be friends, right?

18:50.611 --> 18:53.286
Look, remember
that night right before you left,

18:53.311 --> 18:55.240
- and we went out all night?
- Yes.

18:55.265 --> 18:57.459
- And then we ended up at, um...
- Up at the Broadway Diner.

18:57.483 --> 18:59.022
Yes. Oh, my God, and the waiter thought

18:59.046 --> 19:00.725
you were trying to hit on him,
which you were.

19:00.749 --> 19:02.030
- Yes. I was. Totally.
- You know?

19:02.054 --> 19:04.061
- And I was like, "You should"...
- Oh, okay. Pretend I'm not here. Yeah.

19:04.085 --> 19:05.771
- Yeah. Okay.
- He's very good like that.

19:05.796 --> 19:06.796
Okay.

19:06.821 --> 19:09.216
That was my favorite part
about going out with you.

19:09.241 --> 19:11.372
It wasn't the long nights.

19:11.397 --> 19:13.138
It was the breakfast the next day.

19:13.163 --> 19:15.669
It's the breakfast the next day!

19:15.694 --> 19:18.625
- I love you so much, breakfast!
- Breakfast!

19:18.650 --> 19:20.904
- Aww!
- Ow, ow. Okay.

19:20.929 --> 19:22.053
- Love you so much.
- I love you, too.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.021
It's just, my shoulder's
getting a little...

19:24.794 --> 19:26.186
... thrown out. Okay.

19:26.211 --> 19:27.212
- That was beautiful.
- Sorry.

19:27.236 --> 19:29.802
Alright, you're free to go,
and the wedding is back on.

19:29.827 --> 19:31.294
- Ah!
- Oh, look at that.

19:31.319 --> 19:32.624
Connie, thank you.

19:32.649 --> 19:33.779
Look what I got.

19:34.319 --> 19:35.693
Great.

19:35.718 --> 19:37.170
- Why does Daddy not like him?
- It's a little...

19:37.194 --> 19:39.100
You know what I mean?
It's a little hard to pin down...

19:39.124 --> 19:40.655
- Sure...
- but I think it's because he got caught

19:40.679 --> 19:42.812
low-key maybe embezzling some money.

19:42.837 --> 19:44.756
- What? Lars did?
- Not, like, real embezzlement.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.428
- What, like... What...
- But, like, embezzlement-adjacent...

19:46.452 --> 19:49.411
Thought you might
want a hearty breakfast.

19:49.436 --> 19:51.308
Oh, my God! Breakfast!

19:52.608 --> 19:54.381
- Mike, thank you so much.
- No, literally, this is so good.

19:54.405 --> 19:55.905
- Thank you. You saved my wedding.
- I love this.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.106
- I'm obsessed with you.
- I wouldn't let a wall of fire

19:58.130 --> 19:59.958
stand between you and
this embezzler, so...

19:59.983 --> 20:01.412
- Okay. Thanks...
- ... the honor's mine.

20:01.436 --> 20:02.480
What did he embezzle?

20:02.505 --> 20:04.372
Well, Bernie Madoff was his mentor.

20:04.397 --> 20:05.380
Oh, wow.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.625
But Bernie was actually really nice.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.749
Ow!

20:16.052 --> 20:17.216
Hey, Clara.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.951
No, n-n-n-not so, so, so, so, so loud.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.044
So, so, so loud.

20:23.499 --> 20:25.482
Don't do that. Don't do that.

20:28.132 --> 20:29.785
Oh. If you...

20:30.670 --> 20:33.099
No, no. Don't even try. It's impossible.

20:33.124 --> 20:34.580
Doesn't even matter how strong you are.

20:34.604 --> 20:36.044
There's just... There's just no way.

20:38.703 --> 20:40.974
How did you...

20:40.999 --> 20:44.622
I want you to pick me up and
hold me like a baby kangaroo.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.062
That's pretty cool.
