He's so gorge,
I can't even...

00:59.476 --> 01:01.269
- No way, dude.
What about Brock?

01:01.352 --> 01:02.979

Tree moss is a far more reliable

01:38.348 --> 01:40.600

You're like literally
one of the girls.

01:53.112 --> 01:55.532

One of the girls?!

01:55.615 --> 01:59.619
- This mud mask is both
cleansing and invigorating.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.788

02:01.871 --> 02:05.291

I always mess up my right hand.

how's that hem coming?

- Almost done.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.944
- Thanks. I can wear this
poncho for all five seasons.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.738

02:35.822 --> 02:37.532

You think living with the girls

03:04.976 --> 03:07.687
so, we're spending a weekend
in the extreme wilderness

03:07.770 --> 03:08.938
so, we can turn into steaks?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.231
- Uh, close enough.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.526
Now, are you ready
to get extreme?

03:13.610 --> 03:14.736
- You know it!
- [chests thudding]

03:14.819 --> 03:18.656
- Wait, I promised my dads
I'd stay in their sightline.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.328
It's supposed to be
a really nice B&amp;B.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.663

we supposed to toughen up

03:25.747 --> 03:27.498

03:33.129 --> 03:34.505
- Now this spot looks perfect.

03:34.589 --> 03:39.218
- But the sign says no camping
here, extreme danger.

03:39.302 --> 03:41.638
- Exactly--extreme.

03:41.721 --> 03:45.433
Our first order of
business--securing shelter.

03:45.516 --> 03:48.019
- My dads used this tent
on a safari last year.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.896
It has its own verandah.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.607
- Tough guys don't
sleep on verandahs, Clyde.

03:52.690 --> 03:53.816
They build their own shelter.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.861
- What a beaut.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.156
- All in a manly day's work.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.784
Now how about we rustle
up some grub?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.869
- Great. My dad made
my favorite--

04:04.953 --> 04:06.037
Swiss chard frittata.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.333
- Forget the frittata, Clyde.
Tough guys eat beans.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.420
- Were you thinking chili
or more of a cassoulet?

04:14.504 --> 04:18.091
- Mm! Mm! Mm!
Good stuff, right?

04:18.173 --> 04:20.218
- Very...tasty.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.428
- I think I'll save
the rest for later.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.347
- Yeah, for breakfast--
or never.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.225
- Well, we're burnin'
daylight here.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.269
Better get started
on our campfire.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.311
- Way ahead of you.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.356
This baby's got
LED lights, silk flames,

04:33.439 --> 04:35.358
and a realistic

04:37.193 --> 04:38.319

They brave the elements.

- [farts]
Sorry. Musta been the beans.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.591
Or the loss of feeling
below my waist.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.510
- No need to
apologize, Clyde.

05:02.593 --> 05:04.220
Tough guys let it all out.

05:04.303 --> 05:05.513

has worn me out.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.616
What level of firmness
do you want?

05:25.700 --> 05:29.037
- We don't need that.
The ground will be our mattress.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.206
- Oh, so extra firm.

05:38.254 --> 05:40.715
- We're tough guys,
not animals.

05:40.798 --> 05:42.675
I'm really glad
we did this, Clyde.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.886
Out here in the woods,
away from all the girls,

05:44.969 --> 05:47.388

waking up and--

06:01.611 --> 06:03.488
- Water!
We're in the water!

06:03.571 --> 06:06.616
- Ah! How did this happen?

06:06.699 --> 06:09.118

It's making a dam.

06:19.253 --> 06:20.546
- BOTH: Yeah!
- We're saved.

06:20.630 --> 06:24.425
And all because
we built our own shelter,

06:24.509 --> 06:28.304

- BOTH: [screaming]

06:28.387 --> 06:30.640
- Lincoln? Are you okay?

06:30.723 --> 06:34.185

on a really soft rock.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.895

06:58.584 --> 07:01.963
- [bees buzzing]
- Not a rock. A beehive!

07:02.046 --> 07:04.465
[screaming]

07:04.549 --> 07:06.175
- LINCOLN:
[screaming]

07:06.259 --> 07:08.719
This is still nothing tough
guys like us can't handle.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.432
At least it's not raining.
- [thunder crashing]

07:13.516 --> 07:15.768
- Is that all you've got?

07:15.852 --> 07:17.895
- [mud sloshing]
- BOTH: [screaming]

07:17.979 --> 07:21.941
[panting]

07:22.024 --> 07:24.026
- Lincoln, I know this
probably sounds lame

07:24.110 --> 07:27.363
to a tough guy like you,
but I'm hungry, and wet,

07:27.446 --> 07:29.532
and cold, and I kinda wish

07:29.615 --> 07:31.576
I was with my dads
at the B&amp;B,

07:31.659 --> 07:33.536
eating welcome scones.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.370
- So do I.
[sighing]

07:34.453 --> 07:37.039
I was kidding
myself, Clyde.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.124
I'm no tough guy.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.209
After all those years
around all those women,

07:40.293 --> 07:42.753
it's too late for me.

07:42.837 --> 07:43.963
Now, if you don't mind,

07:44.046 --> 07:47.592
I'm gonna lie down on
this nice soft rock.

07:47.675 --> 07:51.804
- [growling]
- Not a rock! Bear!

07:51.888 --> 07:53.639
- [roaring]
- BOTH: [screaming]

07:53.723 --> 07:56.392
- Clyde, quick, play dead.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.102

07:58.186 --> 07:59.061
[bonks head]

07:59.145 --> 08:02.190
[feet padding]

08:02.273 --> 08:04.275
- Lincoln, that was amazing.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.068
How did you know
to play dead?

08:06.152 --> 08:07.737
- [bonks head]

08:07.820 --> 08:10.990
Oh, I can't rip you apart,
if you're ready dead!

08:11.073 --> 08:13.576
- BOTH: [panting]

08:13.659 --> 08:14.827
- It's something
I learned from Lucy.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.247
- D-D-Does she know anything
about k-k-keeping warm?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.583
- No, but Leni does.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.753
- I can wear this poncho
for all five seasons.

08:23.836 --> 08:26.047
The key is the faux
fur lining.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.842
- Wow, it is so toasty.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.928
- The key is
the birch bark lining.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.181
Now, come on, Clyde,
we're goin' home.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.767
- Which way?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.769
- Why, it's just...

08:41.187 --> 08:43.438
This way!

08:45.024 --> 08:48.861
Lisa said that moss only grows
on the north side of trees.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.822
- My dads are staying at
the North Valley B&amp;B.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.700
Follow that moss!

08:55.826 --> 08:58.371
- [shoes "screeching"]

08:58.454 --> 09:00.331
- How do we get up there?

09:00.414 --> 09:02.208
- You got it, bro.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.710
These accessories will
make our outfits rockin'.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.170
- R-R-R-Rockin'!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.922
- And if you braid
the strands real tight,

09:08.005 --> 09:10.299
they're strong enough to
use as rope, right, Chuck?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.635
- Right as rain, luv.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.805
We're gonna need a bigger
window, though.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.016
- Back two over one.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.393
That'll hold.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.062
- This is great, Lincoln.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.231
What'd you make
this rope out of?

09:25.314 --> 09:27.441
- This should help
the poison ivy.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.652
Oh, my pores are tingling.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.905
- It also soothes sunburn,

19:27.499 --> 19:30.043
- You rock, Loud. Later.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.757
Oh, one more thing...

19:35.841 --> 19:38.218
- Right. The marinara
dipping sauce.

19:38.302 --> 19:42.639
- No, these.
- BOTH: Yes!

19:42.723 --> 19:45.309

so you should bring presents.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.831
You're not wearing
that, are you?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.750
- I'm not going
to the dance.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.335
My boss is making
me work tonight

20:11.418 --> 20:13.879
to pay for all
the free stuff I gave you.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.048
Instead of
"Romance Under the Sea,"

I'm gonna have mozzarella

you wearing?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.482
- This is the only way
my dads would let me

20:33.565 --> 20:36.652
visit a place where I might get
splashed with raw sewage.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.861
Speaking of which,

are you ready to make this
the greatest night ever?

21:00.467 --> 21:02.302
Hey, little bro, thanks for
convincing the manager

21:02.386 --> 21:04.012
to let you fill in for me.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.556
- Huh, it's the least
I could do.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.935
I mean, this dance is why you
got this job in the first place.

21:10.018 --> 21:12.396
- I'm sorry you won't get to
go to your friend's party.

21:12.479 --> 21:15.357
- That's okay.
He's not really my friend.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.692
He was just using me--

21:16.775 --> 21:18.527
the way I was using you.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.278
Have an awesome

without you, Lincoln.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.085
Besides, the Hazmat suit
was giving me a heat rash.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.421
- I guess we'll never
get to experience

21:37.504 --> 21:39.131
the wonders of raw sewage.

21:39.214 --> 21:42.217
- Or have our nose hairs
burned off by the stench.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.303
The toilet in stall
three is overflowing.
