00:00.876 --> 00:02.211
<i>Previously on</i>
Recovery Road...

00:02.211 --> 00:04.171
I don't know
if I trust Cynthia.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.882
It just feels like
she's trying to steal
my daughter away from me.

00:06.882 --> 00:09.301
Sponsoring Maddie
was never part of the deal.

00:09.301 --> 00:12.554
‐Bri.
‐Charlotte Graham!

00:12.554 --> 00:15.390
Maddie‐‐
she's not volunteering.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.769
<i>She's actually kind of</i>
<i>going through it right now.</i>

00:18.769 --> 00:21.355
We don't need parents.
I got your back.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.316
Why are the police after you?

00:24.316 --> 00:25.776
Back up! Back up!

00:25.776 --> 00:27.402
Nobody got shot or anything.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.863
Have you ever been
in a relationship with someone
you shouldn't be?

00:29.863 --> 00:33.450
I can't help but wonder
if there's something
going on there.

00:33.450 --> 00:36.245
You are very lucky
that I play golf with the judge.

00:36.245 --> 00:37.788
Things could've been
far worse.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.999
My whole family said
that they can't talk
to me anymore.

00:40.999 --> 00:43.919
‐I didn't rat you out.
‐But you didn't have
my back either.

00:43.919 --> 00:47.089
You could've told us about this.
We would've been there for you.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.757
Like we were there
for Rebecca?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.427
(creaking)

00:52.427 --> 00:55.681
(both laughing)

00:55.681 --> 00:56.682
Ah!

01:01.228 --> 01:03.397
(distorted laughter)

01:16.201 --> 01:18.412
(no discernible dialog)

01:22.291 --> 01:23.375
(gasps)

01:24.793 --> 01:26.295
Maddie's voice:
<i>I guess we all run from pain...</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:30.382
<i>and from the things</i>
<i>we are afraid of.</i>

01:33.343 --> 01:35.345
<i>Except it's like</i>
<i>when you're a kid</i>

01:35.345 --> 01:37.681
<i>and you close your eyes</i>
<i>at the scary part of the movie.</i>

01:38.682 --> 01:40.684
<i>The images in your head</i>
<i>are far worse</i>

01:40.684 --> 01:42.144
<i>than the reality</i>
<i>could ever be.</i>

01:43.186 --> 01:44.187
Maddie?

01:47.357 --> 01:48.358
Maddie!

01:49.359 --> 01:50.652
Maddie!

01:59.786 --> 02:03.248
‐Good morning, Rebecca.
‐Hi.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.417
You excited about
your sister's graduation?

02:05.417 --> 02:07.127
‐Excited?
‐Yeah.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.671
I was really touched
that Maddie and I got
an invitation.

02:09.671 --> 02:13.300
‐I haven't seen your family in‐‐
‐Yeah, I haven't seen them
in quite some time myself.

02:13.300 --> 02:17.179
Oh. Well, this'll be nice then.

02:17.179 --> 02:20.140
I'm the bad seed,
black sheep, drug addict

02:20.140 --> 02:22.100
who's locked in the attic
and only allowed

02:22.100 --> 02:23.977
to come downstairs
to show everyone else

02:23.977 --> 02:25.437
how really, really supportive

02:25.437 --> 02:27.397
my family's being
during this difficult time.

02:27.397 --> 02:30.400
That's literally
the only reason I've been asked
to attend this thing,

02:30.400 --> 02:34.154
so yeah,
"nice" isn't the word
I would use.

02:34.154 --> 02:37.449
Oh. Well, I hear they hired
an excellent caterer.

02:37.449 --> 02:40.452
(laughs)
I'm sorry.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.621
Do you mind telling Maddie
that I'm down here waiting?

02:42.621 --> 02:44.665
I'm here. All right?

02:44.665 --> 02:46.333
I really don't wanna
go to this thing.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.501
Then don't.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.381
Ouch.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.467
‐That was rude.
‐What? It's not like
she wants to go either.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.095
Besides, I hate the Grangers.
You do too, Mom.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.097
Don't‐‐ don't pretend
like you don't.

03:00.097 --> 03:04.142
(sighs) Okay, I admit it,
I'm not their biggest fan,

03:04.142 --> 03:07.562
but Marcus is doing an entire
office building remodel,

03:07.562 --> 03:09.398
and I'd really like
to put a bid in.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.108
I got outbid
on the last three jobs.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.485
It is still a recession.
I'd like to keep
my team working.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.153
You don't wanna work
for them.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.906
That's like making
a deal with the devil,

03:17.906 --> 03:21.827
or worse‐‐
an office remodel in hell.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.412
We are being
a tad dramatic, aren't we?

03:23.412 --> 03:25.580
I don't know.
They're pretty bad.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.834
Well, be that as it may,
this would still be
a big win for me.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.168
Uh‐huh.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.629
And what if I told you
<i>X: The Man with the X‐Ray Eyes</i>

03:32.629 --> 03:35.507
was playing at the Olympic today
and Wes and I were gonna go?

03:35.507 --> 03:37.384
I'd say I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.345
It's <i>X: The Man</i>
<i>with the X‐Ray Eyes.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:42.806
‐I think the title
is pretty self‐explanatory.
‐Maddie, I really don't want‐‐

03:42.806 --> 03:45.434
Wes, tell my mom we need
to go to the movies,

03:45.434 --> 03:47.978
and I shouldn't have
to go to Rebecca's
sister's graduation.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.440
‐No, you should go.
‐What?

03:51.440 --> 03:54.943
‐Go support Rebecca.
<i>‐Et tu,</i> Wes?

03:55.944 --> 03:56.945
Thank you.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.032
Oh, you know,
in case you haven't heard,

04:01.032 --> 04:02.409
Rebecca hates me.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.328
And I think her family's
a bunch of hypocritical‐‐

04:05.328 --> 04:09.124
‐Maddie.
‐Well, you know what
Oscar Wilde once said,

04:09.124 --> 04:11.209
"We're all in the gutter,

04:11.209 --> 04:13.920
but some of us
are looking at the stars."

04:13.920 --> 04:16.423
Gosh. I don't see
how that applies here.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.092
Okay, Maddie,
get your purse.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.095
All right, fine. I'll go,
since you're all against me,

04:22.095 --> 04:23.680
but I will not be perky.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.849
(scoffs) When have
you ever been perky?

04:25.849 --> 04:27.642
Good point. Let's roll.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.772
Paul: I mean, sure.
There might be a world

04:31.772 --> 04:34.024
in which Marcus
and Pamela Granger

04:34.024 --> 04:37.694
are not the most vilely
repellent people on the planet,

04:37.694 --> 04:40.071
‐but this is not that world.
‐In this world,

04:40.071 --> 04:43.074
they're on
the board of directors,
so we gotta go.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.452
(sighs) I know.
How many of them are there?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.412
Well, the youngest one
is a sophomore,

04:47.412 --> 04:49.498
and when she's gone,
they'll all be gone,
but until then...

04:49.498 --> 04:51.249
<i>A Granger Walks Among Us.</i>

04:51.249 --> 04:53.251
‐Correct.
<i>‐Granger Danger.</i>

04:53.251 --> 04:56.087
‐Pfft!
<i>‐Grangers on a Train.</i>

04:56.087 --> 04:58.423
‐Okay, stop.
<i>‐Grangers with Candy.</i>

04:58.423 --> 05:01.551
‐(scoffs)
<i>‐Never Talk to Grangers.</i>

05:01.551 --> 05:02.594
(sighs)

05:03.929 --> 05:05.514
Okay, come on. We gotta go.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.807
‐We're fine.
‐We're gonna be late.

05:08.558 --> 05:09.351
(sighs)

05:09.351 --> 05:11.853
(doorbell rings)

05:16.358 --> 05:17.400
Hi, Wes.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.363
(theme music playing)

05:23.532 --> 05:28.328
<i>♪ This time is my time,</i>
<i>so step aside ♪</i>

05:30.664 --> 05:32.541
‐Is Craig here?
‐No, umm...

05:32.541 --> 05:35.794
he actually went
to help Vern clear out
his storage unit in Palmdale,

05:35.794 --> 05:39.965
so we're
without a house manager,
and I'm without a sponsor...

05:39.965 --> 05:43.677
right when there's absolutely
nothing remotely triggering
happening in my life,

05:43.677 --> 05:45.554
so... I mean,
it's cool, you know? Really.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.389
They couldn't have picked
a better time to leave.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.518
Hey, it's all right.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.230
I'm clean. Okay?

05:55.230 --> 05:56.690
I'm not holding.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.527
I actually got clean right after
the last time I saw you.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.363
‐You got clean how?
‐Chambers Street Detox.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.449
They let me out yesterday.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.326
Doctors when
I was there were like,

06:08.326 --> 06:10.078
"Seriously, with the amount
of drugs in your system,

06:10.078 --> 06:12.122
I don't even know how
you're even alive right now."

06:13.665 --> 06:16.084
‐I'm sorry.
‐Yeah, I had a seizure, too,

06:16.084 --> 06:18.003
from all the benzos
I was taking.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.882
That stuff's evil, man.
I swear to God.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.426
It wasn't even
getting me high or anything.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.428
I just had to keep taking it
so I wouldn't get sick.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.097
Coming off that can kill you.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.391
I know.

06:35.020 --> 06:38.481
(haltingly)
But you're clean now.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.066
Cross my heart.

06:46.781 --> 06:50.869
Well, good. Good.
I'm really, really happy
for you. I really am, but...

06:52.454 --> 06:55.123
what are you doing here?

06:57.626 --> 06:58.668
(rock music playing on radio)

06:58.668 --> 07:00.503
‐Maddie.
‐Sorry.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.549
Do Rebecca's parents
know about

07:04.549 --> 07:06.635
you being in Springtime Meadows
with Rebecca?

07:06.635 --> 07:09.179
I don't know. Probably not.
It's not like they visit her

07:09.179 --> 07:11.431
or have anything to do with her.
It's super messed up.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.767
‐I'm sure
they have their reasons.
‐Nope, they don't.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.395
‐They suck. That's about it.
‐Well, will your friends
be at the party?

07:17.395 --> 07:18.938
‐I don't know. I hope not.
‐But they don't know

07:18.938 --> 07:20.273
about you and Rebecca
being there.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.275
Yes, they do.
Didn't I tell you?

07:22.275 --> 07:24.486
No. What? What happened?

07:24.486 --> 07:28.490
Ugh! God, it's too annoying
to even talk about.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.159
‐What?
‐I don't know. I mean, I guess

07:31.159 --> 07:33.620
Elle found out first,
then she told Nyla,

07:33.620 --> 07:36.081
and of course Nyla told Zack,
and Zack came to the house,

07:36.081 --> 07:38.917
‐then he broke up with me.
‐You and Zack broke up?

07:38.917 --> 07:41.878
‐True story.
‐Why didn't you tell me?

07:41.878 --> 07:45.548
Ugh. I have to talk
about myself and my feelings

07:45.548 --> 07:48.927
and all the cruel injustice
of the world in group

07:48.927 --> 07:51.388
all of the time.
It's exhausting.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.598
Yeah, but... I'm your mom!

07:53.598 --> 07:56.685
Oh, and Zack‐‐ Zack was like
your first real boyfriend.

07:56.685 --> 07:57.894
You should've
confided in me.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.562
Confide in you?
That would suggest

07:59.562 --> 08:02.232
that my break‐up with Zack
was some kind of secret.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.693
Like I said, I'm not allowed
to have any of those.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.820
My personal life is scattered
all over that house

08:06.820 --> 08:08.947
for everyone to dissect
and analyze

08:08.947 --> 08:12.283
And seriously, if one more
person asks me how I'm feeling,

08:12.283 --> 08:14.661
‐I swear to God‐‐
‐I just think that you and I

08:14.661 --> 08:16.788
should be able to talk
about these things.

08:16.788 --> 08:20.583
Yeah, I know.
I know you do, really.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.129
But, honestly, do we really have
to tell each other everything?

08:26.423 --> 08:28.758
Woman on phone:
<i>Ma'am, your daughter's probably</i>
<i>just at a friend's house.</i>

08:28.758 --> 08:32.262
It's five o'clock
in the morning.
Her curfew is at midnight.

08:32.262 --> 08:35.056
She doesn't always make curfew,
but she always calls.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.726
‐She always calls.
<i>‐Have you tried calling her?</i>

08:37.726 --> 08:40.562
Of course, I have!
I'm not an idiot!

08:40.562 --> 08:41.896
Look, something
must've happened.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.149
I just need you to do your job

08:44.149 --> 08:46.609
and help me find
my daughter, now.

08:46.609 --> 08:50.447
<i>Ma'am, my kids</i>
<i>are at home in bed.</i>
<i>I've done my job.</i>

08:51.531 --> 08:53.241
Huh.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.581
And it was like...

09:02.042 --> 09:05.128
I looked in a mirror and...

09:05.128 --> 09:08.423
it was like...
"If I don't get clean, I'm...

09:10.800 --> 09:12.052
I'm gonna die."

09:13.303 --> 09:17.223
I thought it would
just be better to live
a few short years

09:17.223 --> 09:19.434
‐blissed out on drugs‐‐
‐Yeah, yeah,

09:19.434 --> 09:22.604
"than a whole life
totally depressed
and miserable."

09:22.604 --> 09:26.733
We've had this conversation
so many times before.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.654
All those other times,
I never wanted to get sober
for myself.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.159
‐But now I do.
‐How am I supposed
to trust you?

09:37.786 --> 09:40.038
I know why you called me
to your apartment.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.750
And I'm not stupid.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.713
That's why I'm here now.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.633
You're already making
your amends, huh?

09:52.842 --> 09:57.472
No. I'm here because there's
something that you need to know.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.019
Last week, when Asa came by‐‐

10:03.019 --> 10:06.356
Harper. What are you
doing back here?

10:08.316 --> 10:10.485
Can we go
somewhere else to talk?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.445
Please? It's important.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.614
Yeah.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.080
Could you please try
and not look miserable?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.040
Well, recovery's about honesty.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.167
And having to go to a party
honoring Rebecca's

10:26.167 --> 10:28.378
snotty, little‐miss
perfect‐princess sister

10:28.378 --> 10:30.255
is just about
the definition of misery,

10:30.255 --> 10:32.215
so, yeah, I'm just doing
what I've been told.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.676
Maddie, please,
I don't ask you for much.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.887
Fine, but this goes
into the Pantheon of Asks.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.348
"My dearest, suffering daughter,
could you please come

10:40.348 --> 10:43.810
"to an event feting the sibling
of an old friend who happens
to hate your guts

10:43.810 --> 10:45.728
"and pretend
like nothing is wrong?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.148
Oh, and could you possibly
enjoy yourself?"

10:48.148 --> 10:50.275
All I'm asking
is that you have my back

10:50.275 --> 10:51.693
like I've had yours.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.908
God. You're right, Mom.
I'm sorry.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.744
Okay? I was being selfish.

11:01.744 --> 11:06.416
This is gonna be fun,
and I actually like
Rebecca's parents

11:06.416 --> 11:10.420
and siblings and they love me,
so let's go in there and have
a good time, okay?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.715
‐(sighs)
‐Wow.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.760
If I can convince you,
I'm guessing I can
convince them too.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.387
Oh, let's just go in.

11:21.764 --> 11:25.518
(people chattering)

11:25.518 --> 11:27.687
(piano music playing)

11:31.983 --> 11:35.737
Charlotte. Maddie!
I'm so happy to see you both!

11:35.737 --> 11:37.947
Look at you, Maddie,
always so pretty.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.867
‐Thank you.
‐How's school, Maddie?

11:40.867 --> 11:44.204
Fingers crossed
for an early acceptance to Yale.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.040
I know somebody there.
I would be happy to make
a call for you.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.335
Oh, I don't‐‐
I don't even know what to say.

11:50.335 --> 11:52.503
That would be...

11:53.546 --> 11:54.881
(beeping)

11:54.881 --> 11:56.382
remarkable.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.887
Oh, look, I see Ms. Molina
with the headmaster.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.390
I should go say, hello.
Would you please excuse me
for a second?

12:04.390 --> 12:06.768
Yes, of course.
Oh, it's so good
to see you, Maddie.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.021
Oh, and you, Bri.
Thank you.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.440
See you later, Mom.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.072
It seems like you two are
really back on track

12:19.072 --> 12:20.907
from whatever it was
you were going through.

12:20.907 --> 12:21.866
It's good to see.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.994
I'm sorry. What?

12:24.994 --> 12:28.081
Are you okay, Charlotte?
You seem not okay.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.417
What? No. I'm fine,

12:31.417 --> 12:34.754
‐and we're doing so much better.
‐Bri: That's good to hear.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.305
‐(whispering) Hi.
‐(whispering) Hi, hi.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.724
‐Congratulations.
‐Thank you.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.893
‐Hey, Dad.
‐(mumbles)

12:55.483 --> 12:58.194
‐I haven't been down here in...
‐Two years.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.990
Something like that.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.993
‐Something like that exactly.
‐Looks pretty much the same,
though, huh?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.453
Looks exactly the same.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.168
You know,
when you left the first time
and I ran after you,

13:14.168 --> 13:16.421
then I came back to the house,

13:16.421 --> 13:19.007
I couldn't come down here
for like six months.

13:19.007 --> 13:22.385
But no, I‐‐
I don't know, it was like...

13:22.385 --> 13:24.095
you haunted this place.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.600
And it's taken me a long time
to even start to let that go.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.436
The drugs had me.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.982
And they were stronger
than anything.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.900
But what you and I had...

13:39.694 --> 13:41.279
that was strong, too.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.990
Yeah.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.161
‐That's why I had to come back
and warn you.
‐About Asa?

13:49.704 --> 13:51.998
I was there when they shot him.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.000
Shot who?

13:55.209 --> 13:59.047
‐What are you talking about?
‐At‐‐ at the pharmacy.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.882
Diesel and your brother.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.885
Someone got shot?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.764
Asa told me
that they pulled a gun,

14:07.764 --> 14:11.059
‐but he said nothing happened.
‐No. I was there. I saw it.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.064
‐(heavy breathing)
‐(heart beating)

14:17.148 --> 14:18.399
(no discernible dialog)

14:18.399 --> 14:20.068
‐Let's do this.
‐Whoo!

14:23.112 --> 14:24.530
(bell jingles)

14:24.530 --> 14:25.948
(Harper gasps)

14:28.993 --> 14:31.079
(muffled shouting)

14:36.542 --> 14:38.795
(panicky) No! No.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.594
I can't‐‐ I mean...

14:46.594 --> 14:48.429
What the hell
are you talking about?

14:48.429 --> 14:50.765
Are you telling me
he just stood by

14:50.765 --> 14:54.018
‐while Diesel killed somebody?
‐There was nothing he could do.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.020
Except not be there
in the first place.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.355
I was there, too.

14:58.689 --> 15:01.651
Hey, look at me.
Why are you telling me this?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.903
Why is this my problem?
What the hell am
I supposed to do?

15:03.903 --> 15:06.239
‐It's not my problem!
‐Yes, it is.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.952
Wes, the gun‐‐ Asa's gun.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.705
Please tell me
that you still have it.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.378
(people chattering)

15:20.378 --> 15:23.339
‐(piano music playing)
‐(cell phone buzzing)

15:27.135 --> 15:29.095
(chuckles)

15:30.429 --> 15:32.598
(sighs)

15:41.357 --> 15:42.525
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.694
Excuse me.
Can I borrow you
for a second?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.362
‐Yeah, what's up?
‐Yeah, okay. Just follow me.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.322
‐Excuse me. What?
‐(chuckles)

15:48.322 --> 15:49.323
Trust me.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.161
‐Where are we going?
‐Just trust me.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.374
‐Come here, quick.
‐What are you doing?

15:59.876 --> 16:02.211
(chuckles)

16:02.211 --> 16:04.297
‐Relax. Just‐‐ just relax.
‐Mmm.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.840
Shh!

16:07.008 --> 16:10.178
Wait. No, we can't.
Come on. No, no.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.929
‐Yes, yes, yes.
‐Come on, not here, not here.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.890
‐We can.
‐I mean it.
I mean it. I mean it.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.934
‐What's your problem?
‐What's my problem?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.062
‐Yeah.
‐There's a roomful of parents
and students out there.

16:20.062 --> 16:23.316
‐We‐‐
‐What? Are you not attracted
to me anymore? Is that it?

16:23.316 --> 16:26.611
What are you talking about?
You turned me down
this morning, remember?

16:26.611 --> 16:29.155
Yeah, and I am not
turning you down now.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.496
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop it. Stop it.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.499
What's...
What is wrong with you?

16:40.499 --> 16:42.335
Come on. Jeez.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.170
‐Wow.
‐I was trying to have some fun.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.215
‐I‐‐ I can't‐‐
‐(sighs)

16:47.215 --> 16:48.591
‐Okay.
‐Fine!

16:53.054 --> 16:56.015
‐(sighs)
‐(cell phone chimes)

17:01.270 --> 17:02.813
(chuckles)

17:14.033 --> 17:15.117
(phone camera clicks)

17:18.996 --> 17:19.997
(beeps)

17:26.921 --> 17:30.132
Pamela. Marcus.
It's so good to see you.

17:30.132 --> 17:33.511
‐Thank you so much
for inviting us.
‐Of course.

17:34.512 --> 17:38.307
Maddie Graham.
You are so grown up.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.685
Thank you, Mrs. Granger.
It's really good to see you.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.562
This is a wonderful party.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.147
Bri and I were just saying
that we have to get the name
of your event planner,

17:45.147 --> 17:47.358
because it's just so gorgeous.

17:47.358 --> 17:51.487
Absolutely. Did you see
the vegetable carvings?

17:52.655 --> 17:55.199
‐Yes.
‐They were done
by a local artist.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.286
‐Aren't they exquisite?
‐Uh, yeah.

17:58.286 --> 18:01.581
(sighs)
We are just so proud.

18:03.291 --> 18:05.209
Of the vegetables?

18:05.209 --> 18:09.213
‐Of Penelope.
‐You must be.
You must be very proud.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.049
I mean, this is just
such an accomplishment.

18:12.049 --> 18:15.261
A doctor.
It's just so impressive.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.263
You must be overjoyed.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.223
She'll be doing her residency
at St. Carmine's,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.434
then she'll be shadowing one
of my colleagues at the office.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.187
She's thinking
about specializing
in proctology.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.231
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐So, we are proud.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.485
(jazz music playing)

18:31.485 --> 18:34.030
Is that Rebeccca Granger?

18:34.030 --> 18:36.282
‐Ms. Higgins.
‐(laughs)

18:36.282 --> 18:39.994
I haven't seen you
since you were eight years old.

18:39.994 --> 18:42.288
I know! My God,
it's been forever.

18:42.288 --> 18:45.207
You know, I taught
all three of the Granger girls.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.794
‐Yes, you did.
‐I remember you were
all so proficient

18:48.794 --> 18:54.300
‐in math, reading, and science.
‐Well, I was a very good
third‐grader.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.427
Oh! Why, yes, you were.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.555
And what a lovely young woman
you've turned into.

19:01.766 --> 19:05.186
‐Thank you.
‐It's a shame
about your sister, Heather.

19:06.187 --> 19:07.271
I heard about...

19:07.271 --> 19:08.522
(softly)
the drugs.

19:10.191 --> 19:14.195
What a waste.
She had such a promising future.

19:18.949 --> 19:21.202
‐Heather's outside.
‐Oh.

19:21.202 --> 19:25.623
She turned out just fine.
I'm the one who did
the big, bad drugs.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.416
I'm the waste.

19:27.416 --> 19:33.214
‐Oh, I'm so sorry.
‐No, no, no, there‐‐
there's no need to apologize.

19:36.258 --> 19:40.930
I just want to make sure
that you don't feel responsible.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.725
‐Why would I feel‐‐
‐I know how adults
in leadership roles

19:44.725 --> 19:48.062
can often feel like
they didn't do a good job

19:48.062 --> 19:50.189
in shaping our young minds.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.484
They lie awake at night,
worrying that they
didn't do enough.

19:53.484 --> 19:57.446
You know, couldn't they
have just taught us
some real‐world stuff

19:57.446 --> 19:59.532
along with all that crap
about Christopher Columbus

19:59.532 --> 20:01.283
and the Pythagorean theorem?

20:01.283 --> 20:03.160
But it's important
for you to know...

20:04.495 --> 20:05.996
my drug addiction...

20:06.997 --> 20:09.125
it's not your fault,
Ms. Higgins.

20:18.592 --> 20:22.388
So, that stuff about our mom
being sick was just...

20:22.388 --> 20:25.182
‐A lie.
‐So, it was all just a setup.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.476
It was Diesel's idea,
if it makes you feel any better.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.478
He told Asa to plant
the gun on you.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.355
Oh, that makes me feel
a whole lot better. Thanks.

20:31.355 --> 20:34.275
‐It wasn't his idea. Great.
‐Diesel's crazy.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.860
There's nothing that
your brother could've done.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.779
There's a whole lot
he could've done,

20:38.779 --> 20:42.116
like not frame his brother
for someone's murder.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.119
I know.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.413
But you still have
the gun, right?

20:47.413 --> 20:49.290
So, it's all gonna be okay.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.793
Yeah, I do.

20:52.793 --> 20:54.670
Now, we get rid of it.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.630
Do you know a place?

21:00.050 --> 21:01.677
I think I do.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.979
(jazz music playing)

21:19.445 --> 21:20.988
Of course,
with the American diet,

21:20.988 --> 21:23.574
proctological problems are
at an all‐time high.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.618
They're just... rampant.

21:25.618 --> 21:29.163
And she's such a people person,
I'm confident that her practice
will take off in no time.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.208
Charlotte: Mmm. Uh‐huh.
Well, that's great.

21:32.208 --> 21:36.545
‐Yeah.
‐And I heard you're taking bids
on a remodel.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.464
‐Gonna be a big project.
‐Yes, it is.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.549
I thought about
reaching out to you,

21:40.549 --> 21:43.427
but I figured
medical buildings probably‐‐
they're not your thing.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.555
Well, actually,
we have been branching out

21:46.555 --> 21:49.475
into commercial properties
over the last few years.

21:49.475 --> 21:52.520
We just did
the Grandi Building
remodel in January

21:52.520 --> 21:55.940
and the add‐ons
to the Hasko Business Park
in the fall.

21:55.940 --> 22:01.111
It's a new direction for us,
but it's one that we're
very excited about.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.322
Really?
Well, that's interesting.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.950
I would love
the opportunity to sit down
and talk to you about it.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.161
‐If you have time.
‐Well, yes, I don't see why not.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.746
Why don't you call
my secretary in the morning?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.248
We'll put something
in the books.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.333
‐Okay. Sounds great.
‐Yeah.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.336
She's really great.
You'd be lucky to have her.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.921
‐(chuckles)
‐(softly) Maddie.

22:18.921 --> 22:22.550
‐Mmm?
‐I'm so happy
that you're here.

22:22.550 --> 22:26.303
Must be a bit weird
for you, though.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.888
What do you mean?

22:27.888 --> 22:30.599
It's no secret
that you and Rebecca
are no longer friends.

22:30.599 --> 22:32.434
‐Oh.
‐Sort of breaks my heart.

22:32.434 --> 22:35.855
Well, you know,
people drift apart.

22:35.855 --> 22:39.275
Rebecca made
some very bad decisions.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.486
I know that it put a strain
on a lot of her relationships,

22:42.486 --> 22:46.991
but you were
someone who always was
a good influence.

22:48.784 --> 22:51.620
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that I'm sorry.

22:51.620 --> 22:55.499
I'm sorry
that Rebecca disappointed you.

22:55.499 --> 22:58.627
Trust me. And I hope
that you don't think less of us

22:58.627 --> 23:00.546
because of her bad choices.

23:00.546 --> 23:03.549
I always thought
of you kind of as...

23:04.550 --> 23:08.137
well, one of my own.

23:08.137 --> 23:09.346
Oh.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.101
That‐‐ that's sweet.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.585
‐Hey.
‐(softly) Hey.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.296
Well, this is pretty much
the seventh ring of hell, right?

23:43.756 --> 23:45.925
Is that an expression
or did I just make that up?

23:45.925 --> 23:50.512
There are nine rings of hell,
and actually, I think
they're called circles.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.140
And yeah, they're pretty much
all represented here.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.893
Your sister's gonna be
a proctologist.

23:55.893 --> 23:59.271
There's about 500 jokes
I can make up about that

23:59.271 --> 24:01.482
‐if that'll
make you feel any better.
‐You're not helping.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.780
Look, I just‐‐ I‐‐ I feel‐‐

24:07.780 --> 24:11.075
Oh, please,
don't tell me how you feel.

24:11.075 --> 24:13.911
I don't care.
How about you just
leave me alone?

24:13.911 --> 24:16.372
‐All right?
‐Fine.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.792
‐I will. Happily.
‐(people murmuring)

24:19.792 --> 24:21.502
(mutters)
Damned if I do,
damned if I don't.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.508
Ah! Oh, come on.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.802
I'm sure you're‐‐
that's not true.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.346
‐I mean, you're probably
an excellent cook.
‐No, she's not.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.974
‐(laughs)
‐Excuse me.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.559
‐Hi, Charlotte.
‐Cynthia.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.186
Uh, do you mind?

24:40.187 --> 24:42.064
Of course not.
Excuse me...

24:42.064 --> 24:43.607
‐Marcus: Sure.
‐...for just a minute.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.695
(clears throat )

24:51.407 --> 24:53.325
I'm sorry, I just...

24:53.325 --> 24:55.661
Listen, I know
things have been
awkward between us,

24:55.661 --> 24:57.621
and I just want you
to know that

24:57.621 --> 25:01.125
I only want
what's best for Maddie.
I promise.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.795
I have no ulterior motives.
I only wanna help her.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.548
And help you too, if I can.

25:07.548 --> 25:10.300
You don't have to go
through this alone, Charlotte.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.679
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

25:13.679 --> 25:17.766
In fact, actually,
I've been going
to a few Al‐Anon meetings,

25:17.766 --> 25:20.477
and I found them
very informative.

25:20.477 --> 25:23.605
Wow. I am really
so happy to hear that.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.607
What a wonderful thing
for you to do for Maddie,

25:25.607 --> 25:29.820
especially after everything
that's happened with Zack
and the breakup

25:29.820 --> 25:31.739
and all the friend stuff.

25:31.739 --> 25:36.035
Yes. Of course.
The breakup.

25:36.035 --> 25:40.622
Only Maddie said that things
hadn't been working out
with Zack for a while, so...

25:40.622 --> 25:43.751
‐it was probably for the best.
‐Yeah, yeah. No, no, I know,

25:43.751 --> 25:45.711
but it's still
been hard on her‐‐

25:45.711 --> 25:48.213
having to figure out who she is
now that she's sober

25:48.213 --> 25:50.674
and how she fits in‐‐
it can be really tough.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.177
I've been trying
to help her navigate
through the whole thing,

25:53.177 --> 25:55.971
the best I can,
but you know it's‐‐
it's not easy.

25:55.971 --> 25:59.266
Uh‐huh. So, have you
found her a new sponsor yet?

25:59.266 --> 26:01.852
I mean, one who isn't
her guidance counselor?

26:01.852 --> 26:04.021
Because I can imagine
that the sooner she can start

26:04.021 --> 26:06.065
doing all this
with the right person,

26:06.065 --> 26:07.691
the better off she'll be.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.861
I just want what's best
for Maddie, of course,

26:10.861 --> 26:13.614
just like you do.
What's best for Maddie.

26:14.948 --> 26:19.661
Of course. And yeah, I‐‐
I have a few feelers out.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.831
‐Good.
‐Good.

26:23.999 --> 26:24.958
Good.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.726
This is you
and your brother's
hiding spot.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.311
Won't he know where
to look for this?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.443
Trust me.
He doesn't remember
this place.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.521
Excuse me, everybody.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.189
If I could have
everybody's attention.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.899
Thank you all
for coming today.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.527
Of course...
we all know why we're here‐‐

27:33.527 --> 27:34.736
to celebrate the graduation

27:34.736 --> 27:37.948
of my lovely,
brilliant daughter,
Penelope Anne Granger.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.373
Your mother and I were
talking just this morning

27:46.373 --> 27:48.584
about her first day
of kindergarten.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.627
You got up
three hours early

27:50.627 --> 27:52.337
and you were waiting
by the door.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.673
She was so scared
that she was gonna miss it.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.718
You were always
the perfect daughter.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.888
And I love my boys,
and I love all my daughters
very much.

28:00.888 --> 28:04.850
But some apples do fall
a little closer to the tree
than others, huh?

28:04.850 --> 28:08.729
(laughter)

28:08.729 --> 28:10.439
We are the luckiest parents
in the world.

28:10.439 --> 28:12.232
Pam and I tell
each other that every day.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.861
Although, we obviously did
some things right, too.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.654
There was a lot of love
in our house.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.199
We cared
for each other so deeply,

28:21.199 --> 28:23.660
and we always supported
all our children

28:23.660 --> 28:25.329
in all their endeavors.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.748
Yeah, except when it came
to your other daughter,
Rebecca...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.919
who your turned your back on.

28:31.919 --> 28:35.422
‐I‐‐ I'm sorry?
‐Rebecca.

28:35.422 --> 28:39.134
Did you forget about her?
No, of course you didn't.

28:39.134 --> 28:41.386
You didn't forget,
because you love punishing her.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.305
You love treating her
like she's garbage,

28:43.305 --> 28:46.767
even though she's doing
everything she can to turn
her life around

28:46.767 --> 28:49.394
with absolutely no help
whatsoever from you...

28:49.394 --> 28:50.646
or you or you.

28:52.314 --> 28:55.943
I live with Rebecca
at a sober living house.

28:57.152 --> 29:01.657
And I can tell you
she's there for people
when they need her.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.618
People count on her.
She stands up for them
every day,

29:04.618 --> 29:06.662
and she does not deserve
to be treated like this.

29:06.662 --> 29:11.083
'Cause even though we may be
a bunch of rejects with drug
and alcohol problems,

29:11.083 --> 29:15.504
at least we're not a bunch
of uptight, self‐righteous,
self‐important douche bags

29:15.504 --> 29:18.090
who care more about
some ugly ass vegetable carvings

29:18.090 --> 29:21.468
and stupid flower arrangements
than they do their own daughter.

29:23.595 --> 29:27.015
Who has a disease, by the way,
and is getting better.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.935
You all are doctors.
You should know this,

29:29.935 --> 29:34.606
although maybe you're too busy
looking up a lot of rich,
old people's asses.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.316
Are you gonna stop
your daughter or not?

29:36.316 --> 29:38.860
(murmuring)

29:38.860 --> 29:40.362
The hell I will.

29:40.362 --> 29:42.864
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

29:42.864 --> 29:46.493
And you.
You're her mother.
How could you?

29:48.370 --> 29:51.707
‐Let's go, Maddie.
‐Every person in Rebecca's life

29:51.707 --> 29:53.959
turned their back
on her, even me.

29:53.959 --> 29:57.838
And I wish to God
that I could go back
and fix everything, but I can't.

29:57.838 --> 30:00.590
Whether she hates me
forever for that or not,

30:00.590 --> 30:01.842
I have to live with it.

30:01.842 --> 30:06.596
But you people,
you don't deserve Rebecca.

30:24.990 --> 30:28.076
Maddie Graham is
at Springtime Meadows
with Rebecca Granger?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.661
Did you know about this?

30:33.331 --> 30:35.000
I love you.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.293
(sighs)

30:37.294 --> 30:38.962
‐(both laughing)
‐God!

30:38.962 --> 30:41.965
God! Did you see
the look on his face?

30:41.965 --> 30:43.633
Oh, on all their faces.

30:43.633 --> 30:46.386
‐I can't believe I did that.
‐I can't either.

30:46.386 --> 30:49.056
‐And you're not mad at me.
‐Are you kidding?

30:49.056 --> 30:52.059
I am so proud of you.

30:52.059 --> 30:53.935
That was... awesome.

30:53.935 --> 30:56.063
Mom, I really appreciate

30:56.063 --> 30:58.273
you standing by me,
sticking up for me,

30:58.273 --> 31:00.734
‐all your support, everything.
‐Of course.

31:00.734 --> 31:03.070
‐I'm your mother.
‐Yeah, but not all moms do that.

31:03.070 --> 31:07.616
‐No. No, that's true.
‐And I'm sorry for the way
I acted today.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.827
I mean, for everything.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.829
I know it's been hard
for the both of us,

31:12.829 --> 31:14.956
but for you especially.

31:16.500 --> 31:17.459
Sorry.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.546
But you had my back.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.968
I appreciate that, Maddie.
I do. I really, really do.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.929
I just‐‐
I love you so much.

Ms. Molina.
This is Charlotte Graham,
Maddie's mom.

33:01.521 --> 33:04.774
Cynthia on phone:
<i>Oh, hi, Mrs. Graham.</i>
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

33:04.774 --> 33:10.030
<i>‐It's so early.</i>
‐I‐‐ I need your help.

33:10.030 --> 33:14.075
Do you think you could
do a search of my daughter's
locker this morning?

33:14.075 --> 33:14.993
She...

33:16.912 --> 33:20.123
Something's going on with her.
I don't know what it is.

33:20.123 --> 33:23.585
She... stayed out
all night last night,

33:23.585 --> 33:25.295
and she finally came home...

33:27.547 --> 33:29.591
seven o'clock in the morning.

33:31.259 --> 33:34.346
And... I know
she was drinking...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.682
and I don't know
what else, but...

33:39.226 --> 33:41.853
I'm really scared for her.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.440
And I don't know what to do.
She needs help...

33:46.441 --> 33:49.236
and I can't be
the one to‐‐ I mean...

33:50.445 --> 33:53.531
Please. You have to help me.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.747
And listen...

34:02.207 --> 34:04.292
I do have something
that I need to tell you.

34:10.507 --> 34:14.094
I‐‐ I‐‐ I just‐‐
I needed to tell you that...

34:15.178 --> 34:17.806
‐Huh?
‐I'm sort of seeing someone.

34:20.475 --> 34:24.104
‐It's new.
I met him at Al‐Anon.
‐Oh.

34:26.356 --> 34:29.150
Wow. I‐‐ I think
that's great, really.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.445
Because I'm...

34:34.698 --> 34:37.284
I'm kinda interested
in someone too.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.162
‐Oh really? Who?
‐Wes.

34:41.162 --> 34:44.249
Mmm. Yeah. I kind of thought
that was happening.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.293
He's pretty great, huh?

34:46.293 --> 34:49.170
He's a very...
interesting young man.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.758
‐You don't like him.
‐No, no. I do. I do.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.177
Let me guess.
You're worried because
he's a former addict.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.930
No, that's not it.
I just‐‐ well, I mean,

34:58.930 --> 35:01.266
‐he works for me.
‐Seriously?

35:01.266 --> 35:03.852
‐That's your only concern?
‐Well, yeah.

35:03.852 --> 35:07.314
All right. I‐‐ I think
we can work with that.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.275
‐We can?
‐Mm‐hmm.

35:10.275 --> 35:13.320
Wha‐‐ Don't you think
that that would make
Wes uncomfortable?

35:13.320 --> 35:16.197
No. He's not like that.
He's cool.

35:16.197 --> 35:19.242
So, what do you think?

35:19.242 --> 35:23.371
‐Think I should do it?
‐Well, I mean...

35:23.371 --> 35:25.915
‐Sure.
‐Okay.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.841
So, what are you gonna do now?

35:34.841 --> 35:36.968
Do you have
anywhere you can go?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.720
Not really.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.597
I need to get away
from this place.

35:40.597 --> 35:44.267
Have you checked out
sober livings in LA
or San Francisco?

35:44.267 --> 35:47.228
I can't go back
to another one
of those places.

35:48.355 --> 35:51.858
‐Why not?
‐The meetings and everything.

35:51.858 --> 35:54.110
Group therapy
is just not my thing.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.404
I really‐‐ I...

35:56.404 --> 36:00.283
I want to stay clean.
I just can't handle
all the rules.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.873
‐I do actually have friends
I can reach out to.
‐Friends where?

36:08.208 --> 36:11.419
‐Do you remember Alexandra?
‐Uh‐huh.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.297
She just moved to Austin.
She really likes it there.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.218
You could come with me...

36:18.218 --> 36:19.469
if you wanted to.

36:21.429 --> 36:23.139
It'll be fun.
(chuckles)

36:29.270 --> 36:31.523
No. I can't.

36:33.441 --> 36:36.403
Someone once told me that

36:36.403 --> 36:39.239
there's something in knowing
where you belong.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.909
Well, I belong here.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.495
It's because
of that girl, isn't it?

36:45.495 --> 36:48.498
‐No, it's not.
‐Then why?

36:48.498 --> 36:52.585
Because this is my family.
Not Asa, not my mom,

36:52.585 --> 36:55.296
but the people
in this house, my sponsor.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.967
You may not need
the program like I do, but I do.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.137
I need it.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.724
And I can't just
walk away from that.

37:16.985 --> 37:17.986
(whispers) Okay?

37:39.424 --> 37:40.633
Bye, Wes.

37:51.311 --> 37:52.687
(softly) Good‐bye.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.447
That was
kind of weird, right?

(stammers)
I'm really proud of Maddie.

38:10.747 --> 38:14.292
No, I‐‐ I wasn't talking

‐The janitor's closet, the‐‐
‐Oh! (sputters)

38:19.839 --> 38:21.758
That. I don't know.
I was just‐‐

38:21.758 --> 38:23.384
I was just trying
to have a little fun.

38:23.384 --> 38:25.595
‐That's all.
It's no big deal.
‐But you're‐‐

38:25.595 --> 38:27.388
‐you're okay?
Everything's okay?
‐Yeah!

38:27.388 --> 38:29.724
‐Okay.
‐Of course.
I'm‐‐ I'm great.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.435
‐You're sure?
‐Yes.

38:33.478 --> 38:34.479
I promise.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.649
‐Okay.
‐Yeah.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.318
(chuckles)

38:43.530 --> 38:46.157

<i>Are you gonna stop</i>

39:41.296 --> 39:43.131
Charlotte:
<i>The hell I will.</i>

39:44.173 --> 39:45.884
<i>You should be ashamed</i>
<i>of yourself.</i>

39:45.884 --> 39:48.428
<i>And you.</i>
<i>You're her mother.</i>

39:48.428 --> 39:50.263
Maddie on phone:
<i>Every person in Rebecca's life</i>

39:50.263 --> 39:52.432
<i>turned their back</i>
<i>on her, even me.</i>

39:52.432 --> 39:54.434
<i>And I wish to God</i>
<i>that I could go back</i>

39:54.434 --> 39:56.477
<i>and fix everything,</i>
<i>but I can't.</i>

39:56.477 --> 40:00.857

<i>forever for that or not,</i>
<i>I have to live with it.</i>

40:00.857 --> 40:05.653
<i>But you people,</i>
<i>you don't deserve Rebecca.</i>

40:09.532 --> 40:11.743

‐Hey.

40:15.204 --> 40:17.498

I'm sorry.

40:29.510 --> 40:32.513
(girls laughing)

40:32.513 --> 40:33.806
