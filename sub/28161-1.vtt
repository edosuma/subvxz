01:24.108 --> 01:27.077
[Assertive dance music]

01:30.281 --> 01:34.411
I got my red dress on

01:34.485 --> 01:38.512
and my high heels too.

01:38.589 --> 01:42.355
A pleasure that's forbidden.

01:42.426 --> 01:44.724
Hey, Ethan.

01:44.796 --> 01:46.730
Hey, you.

01:46.798 --> 01:48.493
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.557
I got all turned around
at the station.

01:50.635 --> 01:51.761
No worries.

01:51.836 --> 01:55.101
Abby this is Mio, Jin, Asami.

01:55.173 --> 01:56.663
Nice to meet you.

01:56.741 --> 01:57.730
Hey, you want to get a drink?

01:57.809 --> 02:00.334

Bye-bye.

02:06.984 --> 02:08.883
Hey.

02:08.953 --> 02:11.615
Um, I'll be right back,
business.

02:25.736 --> 02:26.703
Hi, I'm Abby.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.738
Yeah, figured.

02:27.805 --> 02:28.772
Charlie.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.467
So you guys know Ethan?

02:30.541 --> 02:32.270
Who doesn't, sugar?

02:32.343 --> 02:33.935
Gretchen.

02:34.011 --> 02:35.706
You sound like
you're from the South.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.044
Oh, no, I just like
to talk this way.

02:38.115 --> 02:39.707
So, Abby, fresh off the plane, I hear.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.752
Two weeks, actually.

02:41.819 --> 02:43.286
It's wild.

02:43.354 --> 02:45.049
I never thought
I'd end up in Tokyo.

02:45.122 --> 02:46.589
But Ethan's work is here,

02:46.657 --> 02:47.783
and I just couldn't stand

02:47.859 --> 02:49.724
the whole long-distance relationship,
you know?

02:49.794 --> 02:52.024
Abby, need work?

02:52.096 --> 02:53.461
Oh, no, thanks.

02:53.531 --> 02:54.498
I'm all set.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.829
I got this job as a copy editor
at a Japanese law firm.

02:56.901 --> 02:58.095
Poor drone.

02:58.169 --> 02:59.261
How prestigious.

02:59.337 --> 03:00.634
Please, it's a joke.

03:00.705 --> 03:03.003
They barely give me
anything to do.

03:03.074 --> 03:04.735
So what do you guys do?

03:04.809 --> 03:07.676
I drink, and Gretchen's a geisha.

03:07.745 --> 03:09.838
I'm not a geisha;
I'm a goddess.

03:09.914 --> 03:10.881
She's a hooker.

03:10.948 --> 03:12.711
I'm a hostess, okay?

03:12.783 --> 03:13.750
What's that?

03:13.818 --> 03:17.049
I get paid to look good
and entertain businessmen.

03:18.289 --> 03:19.483
Here you go.

Night driving on a motorway

03:52.690 --> 03:56.456
Aren't you glad I'm here?

04:15.680 --> 04:17.704
So what's going on?

04:18.950 --> 04:20.247
Got a new client.

04:20.317 --> 04:21.546
Got to go to Osaka.

04:21.619 --> 04:24.782
They need their website up and running
as of yesterday, so...

04:24.855 --> 04:26.720
So?

04:30.194 --> 04:32.287
How about I come with you?

04:32.363 --> 04:34.126
Don't you have to work?

04:34.198 --> 04:36.928
I hate my stupid job.

04:37.001 --> 04:39.970
You'll work,
and I'll be the tourist.

04:40.037 --> 04:41.095
Come on, we could?

04:41.172 --> 04:42.867
We could just play
all weekend long.

04:42.940 --> 04:45.966
It's gonna be nonstop,
24-7, babe.

04:46.043 --> 04:49.342
I'm not gonna have any time
to hang out at all.

04:49.413 --> 04:53.372
Well, when are you
coming back?

04:55.686 --> 04:57.620
I'm not sure.

04:57.688 --> 04:58.655
You know?

04:58.723 --> 05:00.384
It could be a while.

05:00.458 --> 05:04.895
As in a week a while?

05:08.899 --> 05:10.833
Ethan?

05:10.901 --> 05:13.233
You know how you asked me last night
if I was glad you came?

05:13.304 --> 05:14.271
Yeah.

05:14.338 --> 05:15.930
Well, I really wanted
to say yes,

05:16.007 --> 05:17.872
but I couldn't.

05:17.942 --> 05:20.638
And that's messed up,
you know?

05:20.711 --> 05:23.236
It's just gotten really intense
with you moving to Tokyo.

05:23.314 --> 05:25.339
And you got to admit,
it happened really fast.

05:25.416 --> 05:26.781
What do you mean?

05:26.851 --> 05:28.045
We talked about this.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.245
No, we didn't talk about it.

05:29.320 --> 05:30.844
You just called
and said you were coming.

05:30.921 --> 05:32.149
You said you wanted me
to come.

05:32.223 --> 05:34.088
No, no, I never said that,
Abby.

05:34.158 --> 05:35.682
Yes, you did.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.193
I know I never said that.

05:37.261 --> 05:38.660
Yes, you did.

05:38.729 --> 05:42.290
Abby, I'm just not feeling it.

05:44.402 --> 05:48.964
So now I'm gonna do
what I need to do, okay?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.530
I got to go.

05:53.611 --> 05:55.306
So you're not coming back, then?

05:55.379 --> 05:56.903
I never said that.

05:58.082 --> 06:00.243
This is crazy.

06:00.317 --> 06:01.409
Abby, I'm sorry.

06:01.485 --> 06:02.975
I know this stinks.

06:03.054 --> 06:05.488
But I have to do
what I have to do.

06:05.556 --> 06:06.523
I'm a traveler.

06:06.590 --> 06:09.753

pack my whole life into two suitcases.

Cheer up, cheer up.

06:13.197 --> 06:14.164
I might be back.

06:18.869 --> 06:20.336

of all people in the whole world,

06:22.706 --> 06:24.503
you'd understand this.

everything we said.

all my fault.

about me coming here.

I'm sorry,

08:56.026 --> 08:58.426

and I'm?

49:47.575 --> 49:50.567
probably, I should go.

49:50.645 --> 49:51.873
Sorry to bother you.

49:51.946 --> 49:53.243
No.

49:56.484 --> 49:58.418
Wait.

49:58.486 --> 50:00.716
Do you want something to drink
before you go?

50:00.789 --> 50:03.121
I mean,
you've come all this way.

50:03.191 --> 50:06.627
Personally, I could
really use a beer.

50:08.263 --> 50:09.855
Yeah, me too.

50:09.931 --> 50:10.920
Okay.

50:10.999 --> 50:13.467
That's the ramen shop
where I work.

50:15.704 --> 50:16.966
Easy commute.

50:17.038 --> 50:19.268
Yeah.

50:19.340 --> 50:21.274
- Your boss.
- Mm-hmm?

50:21.342 --> 50:22.309
He speaks English?

50:22.377 --> 50:23.969
Oh, not a word.

50:24.045 --> 50:25.444
Really?

50:25.513 --> 50:27.674
I can't understand
a word he tells me.

50:27.749 --> 50:29.842
Not to mention he's psychotic.

50:29.918 --> 50:31.442
He keeps trying to kill me.

50:31.519 --> 50:32.508
Why do you stay?

50:33.354 --> 50:36.448
Hmm.

50:36.524 --> 50:41.120
Maybe it's because
I have nowhere else to go.

50:41.196 --> 50:42.458
Hmm.

50:42.530 --> 50:44.555
That's pathetic.

50:44.632 --> 50:46.623
No.

50:46.701 --> 50:49.067
I think you're on the path
to something.

50:49.137 --> 50:51.662
One day, I'm sure
I'll taste Abby's ramen.

50:51.740 --> 50:54.732
God, I hope so.

50:54.809 --> 50:56.037
Yeah.

50:56.111 --> 50:57.078
So what about you?

50:57.145 --> 50:58.737
What's your path?

50:58.813 --> 51:02.340
My path.

51:02.417 --> 51:04.442
Hmm.

51:04.519 --> 51:06.282
Typical Japanese.

51:08.022 --> 51:11.321
Work in a big company,

51:11.392 --> 51:13.553
get married,

51:13.628 --> 51:16.722
have children,

51:16.798 --> 51:18.857
grandchildren,

51:18.933 --> 51:20.127
grow old,

51:20.201 --> 51:22.260
then die.

51:24.205 --> 51:25.968
That's just grim.

51:27.275 --> 51:29.175
Back in college, I wrote music.

51:29.244 --> 51:30.211
I had a band.

51:30.278 --> 51:32.269
That's cool.

51:32.347 --> 51:34.645
Most of the time,
we just got really drunk.

51:34.716 --> 51:35.876
[Laughs]

51:35.950 --> 51:38.418
And we were talking about
how we were going to make

51:38.486 --> 51:41.182
the revolution in
the Japanese music world.

51:41.256 --> 51:44.987
Then, of course,
we all became salary men.

51:45.059 --> 51:47.220
It's what our parents wanted.

51:47.295 --> 51:49.763
My parents would only be happy

51:49.831 --> 51:52.026
if I became a partner
at a major law firm.

51:53.535 --> 51:56.299
Strange.

51:56.371 --> 51:59.067
Who'd think to look at us
that we'd have the same problem?

52:00.675 --> 52:02.802
<i>Omoshiroi ne.</i>

52:02.877 --> 52:04.936
Interesting.

52:05.013 --> 52:08.608
Somewhere along the way,

52:08.683 --> 52:11.015
I just forgot what I wanted
to do with my life.

52:13.888 --> 52:17.324
Sometimes when I wake up
in the morning,

52:17.392 --> 52:18.359
I can't breathe.

52:19.928 --> 52:22.920
That's probably why I started
this icky habit.

52:22.997 --> 52:24.624
Sorry.

52:24.699 --> 52:27.862
I smoked your last one,
and I don't have any.

52:27.936 --> 52:30.063
Want to take a walk?

52:30.138 --> 52:31.765
It's a monsoon.

52:31.840 --> 52:34.809
[Laughter]

52:40.114 --> 52:42.639
I guess I should go home now.

52:42.717 --> 52:43.809
Almost the morning.

52:45.854 --> 52:48.379
Have you ever been
to the ramen museum in Yokohama?

52:48.456 --> 52:51.516
There's a ramen museum
in Yokohama?

52:51.593 --> 52:52.560
You're kidding me.

52:52.627 --> 52:53.594
I'm not kidding.

52:53.661 --> 52:55.185
What? Really?

52:55.263 --> 52:56.230
Yeah, really.

52:56.297 --> 52:57.491
Okay, I have to see this.

52:57.565 --> 52:59.590
Yeah, so, um...

52:59.667 --> 53:00.861
let's go then, next weekend.

53:00.935 --> 53:04.166
- Yeah, okay.
- Great.

53:04.239 --> 53:05.206
I'll let Gretchen know.

53:05.273 --> 53:07.605
I don't think
she's interested.

53:08.409 --> 53:10.309
Yeah, but it would be awkward.

53:10.378 --> 53:11.675
You know, she's my friend.

53:11.746 --> 53:13.373
I have to let her know.

53:13.448 --> 53:14.574
You guys are going out and all.

53:14.649 --> 53:15.707
Hmm?

53:15.783 --> 53:17.410
But that first night,

53:17.485 --> 53:19.077
you took the taxi cab
home together.

53:20.922 --> 53:23.550
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

53:23.625 --> 53:25.183
She just shared the cab with me.

53:25.260 --> 53:26.227
Oh.

53:26.294 --> 53:27.761
[Laughter]

53:27.829 --> 53:29.854
So it's okay?

53:29.931 --> 53:30.898
I call you?

53:32.400 --> 53:34.368
Yeah.

53:34.435 --> 53:36.596
It's okay.
You call me.

53:38.940 --> 53:40.703

53:40.775 --> 53:42.743
Over the fields we go,

53:42.810 --> 53:44.607

Bells on bobtails ring,

53:48.383 --> 53:50.248
Oh, what fun it is to laugh and sing

53:50.318 --> 53:52.149
a sleighing song tonight.

53:52.220 --> 53:54.051
Jingle bells, jingle bells,

53:54.122 --> 53:55.851
jingle all the way.

53:55.924 --> 53:57.585
Oh, what fun it is to ride

53:57.659 --> 53:59.650

I thought the decorations
would look nice.

55:33.054 --> 55:34.646
I bought them at the market.

the texture.

Hey, Japan,

I was fired tonight
on Christmas Eve.

58:15.183 --> 58:16.946
Rotten, heartless Japanese.

58:17.018 --> 58:19.748
Cold-blooded Japan.

I'll tell you one thing,

58:21.689 --> 58:24.749
nobody's running this goddess
out of town.

58:24.825 --> 58:26.622
The longer I'm here,

58:26.694 --> 58:33.031
the more I realize I don't
understand anything or anybody.

58:33.968 --> 58:37.529

58:37.605 --> 58:42.065

it was the language, and now?

58:42.143 --> 58:45.010
Now I realize I just
don't get him at all.

58:45.079 --> 58:46.046
It's a bowl of soup.

58:46.113 --> 58:48.343

tell the man to get over it.

Mm-mm.

58:50.418 --> 58:51.476
No, no.

There's something about
the Japanese

58:53.421 --> 58:57.221
and making the perfect bowl
of soup.

58:57.291 --> 58:58.918
It's kind of beautiful.

58:58.993 --> 59:01.928
It's like with each bowl,

59:01.996 --> 59:05.432
you try to get closer
to perfection.

59:05.499 --> 59:07.467
I think that's beautiful.

59:07.535 --> 59:08.502

survive in this country

I came here one time
with my school.

01:00:13.734 --> 01:00:15.224
The other kids
always made fun of me

01:00:15.303 --> 01:00:17.965
because my grandparents
came from Korea.

01:00:20.107 --> 01:00:23.201

from those kids

01:00:23.277 --> 01:00:26.713

01:08:33.934 --> 01:08:35.265
Please, will you taste my broth?

01:08:38.438 --> 01:08:41.167
Please, sensei.

01:08:42.843 --> 01:08:45.812
[Singing continues]

01:09:10.737 --> 01:09:11.863
[Gasps]

01:09:20.380 --> 01:09:21.368
What are you doing?

01:09:24.384 --> 01:09:27.911
I did everything I saw you do,
everything.

01:09:42.269 --> 01:09:43.895
I'll miss you.

01:09:45.138 --> 01:09:48.595
I'll miss you too.

01:09:48.675 --> 01:09:52.042
Are you sure you won't
come with me to the airport?

01:09:52.112 --> 01:09:54.307
No, no.

01:09:54.381 --> 01:09:56.372
That'd be too sad.

01:09:56.450 --> 01:10:01.149
Can you just tell me again,
just? Just one more time.

01:10:01.221 --> 01:10:03.587
You really, really wanted me
to go with you?

01:10:18.305 --> 01:10:19.704
Go.

01:10:19.873 --> 01:10:21.568
Go.

01:10:21.642 --> 01:10:24.008
You're gonna miss your flight.

01:10:24.077 --> 01:10:25.806
Go.

01:10:38.859 --> 01:10:40.451
Go.

01:11:24.438 --> 01:11:26.406
Sensei, wait.

01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:30.270
Sensei, please help me.

01:11:32.779 --> 01:11:34.542
I keep trying,
and I never get it.

01:11:36.483 --> 01:11:37.575
Please.

01:11:38.418 --> 01:11:40.978
Teach me how to have?

01:12:18.692 --> 01:12:20.216
[Wooden pounding sound]

01:12:20.293 --> 01:12:21.817
Ah.

01:13:56.723 --> 01:13:59.191
But how?

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:56.973
I don't know anything
about love.

01:14:57.817 --> 01:15:01.344
Every time I feel it,
it's gone.

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:06.622
It disappears.

01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:12.424
And all I have left is...

01:15:12.499 --> 01:15:15.161
pain...

01:15:15.235 --> 01:15:17.294
and sadness.

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:20.679
[All weeping]

01:20:18.238 --> 01:20:21.207
[Laughing]

01:20:35.421 --> 01:20:38.481
[All weeping]

01:20:38.558 --> 01:20:41.083
[Laughing]

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.129
[Dramatic percussion music]

01:21:13.993 --> 01:21:16.962
[Snoring]

01:22:21.027 --> 01:22:25.327
[Coughing]

01:23:05.238 --> 01:23:08.207
[Cheers and applause]

01:26:04.183 --> 01:26:06.413
See you again.

01:28:14.347 --> 01:28:17.316
I just needed
to create something for myself.

01:28:17.383 --> 01:28:20.113
"Myself, myself."

01:30:44.296 --> 01:30:47.356
"Sa ku se sa."

01:30:47.433 --> 01:30:48.661
"Successor."

01:30:48.734 --> 01:30:51.294
Successor.

01:30:58.110 --> 01:31:01.773
You...

01:31:01.847 --> 01:31:03.678
my successor.

01:31:12.224 --> 01:31:13.851
I'd be honored.

01:31:42.555 --> 01:31:43.852
[Laughs]

01:31:43.923 --> 01:31:45.390
Where's sensei?

01:31:45.457 --> 01:31:47.357
I can't leave without
saying good-bye to sensei.

01:31:47.426 --> 01:31:50.395
[Rhythmic clapping and chanting]

01:32:05.611 --> 01:32:08.580
[Cheers and applause]

01:32:17.523 --> 01:32:20.492
[Rhythmic chanting and clapping]

01:33:29.161 --> 01:33:32.130
[Voices overlapping]

01:33:36.869 --> 01:33:39.599
Four Tokyos, one Goddess,
and one Maezumi Special.

01:33:39.672 --> 01:33:40.639
In a minute.

01:33:40.706 --> 01:33:41.866
Hey, Abby, there's a guy here.

01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:42.998
He says he knows you.

01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:44.565
Who is he?
From where?

01:33:44.643 --> 01:33:45.940
I don't know.

01:34:00.426 --> 01:34:03.918
I hated my job,
so I did what you would do.

01:34:03.996 --> 01:34:05.088
I quit.

01:34:06.198 --> 01:34:07.529
I started writing music again.

01:34:17.943 --> 01:34:20.241
Welcome to my ramen shop.

01:35:09.128 --> 01:35:12.097
[Upbeat indie rock music]

01:35:16.902 --> 01:35:18.062
Staring at the pot,

01:35:18.137 --> 01:35:21.300
she was putting in a lot
of her time.

01:35:24.276 --> 01:35:26.039
Her heart was beating
in her chest.

01:35:26.111 --> 01:35:27.601
She's pointing and swearing,

01:35:27.679 --> 01:35:29.613
and it's mine.

01:35:29.681 --> 01:35:32.775
It's mine.

01:35:32.851 --> 01:35:35.843
My ramen girl,

01:35:35.921 --> 01:35:37.479
seen from above,

01:35:37.556 --> 01:35:40.354
and shining bright like a pearl.

01:35:40.426 --> 01:35:43.395
My ramen girl

01:35:43.462 --> 01:35:46.295
made me a specialty,

01:35:46.365 --> 01:35:49.994
messed with my world.

01:35:55.007 --> 01:35:56.565
Have you ever seen

01:35:56.642 --> 01:35:59.839
a girl on the scene
quite like this?

01:36:02.548 --> 01:36:04.243
On the streets of Shinjuku,

01:36:04.316 --> 01:36:07.615
I promised you a taste,
and it's bliss.

01:36:09.922 --> 01:36:11.389
She's got me all confused

01:36:11.457 --> 01:36:13.254
about a little more than food.

01:36:13.325 --> 01:36:15.350
It's like this.

01:36:18.564 --> 01:36:21.362
She knows just what to do.

01:36:21.433 --> 01:36:24.061
Moves around the stove
like a dancer.

01:36:24.136 --> 01:36:25.865
I have to pursue.

01:36:25.938 --> 01:36:28.873
The aroma draws me near.

01:36:28.941 --> 01:36:29.908
I lose my mind

01:36:29.975 --> 01:36:33.467
and fall to my knees
as the world disappears.

01:36:33.545 --> 01:36:35.274
No, she didn't.

01:36:35.347 --> 01:36:37.474
Yes, she did.

01:36:37.549 --> 01:36:40.313
My ramen girl,

01:36:40.385 --> 01:36:42.114
seen from above

01:36:42.187 --> 01:36:45.088
with a shine in the night
like a pearl.

01:36:45.157 --> 01:36:48.092
My ramen girl

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:50.993
made me a specialty,

01:36:51.063 --> 01:36:54.760
messed with my world.
