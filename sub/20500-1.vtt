00:18.459 --> 00:21.789
BASED ON THE NOVEL
BY JUSSI ADLER-OLSEN

01:57.043 --> 02:04.373
A CONSPIRACY OF FAITH

02:14.168 --> 02:16.918
Assad.

02:17.043 --> 02:19.043
Not now.

02:19.168 --> 02:22.248
Come on, Assad.

02:29.501 --> 02:33.541
- Come on.
- I'm working, Rose.

02:33.668 --> 02:35.618
<i>- One</i> round.
- I'm working.

02:35.751 --> 02:37.831
Come on, Assad.

02:40.668 --> 02:43.038
- One round.
- Have you been practicing?

02:43.126 --> 02:46.626
A bit, but I need to practice on you.

02:49.293 --> 02:50.043
Hook!

02:54.918 --> 02:58.458
- Good! Come on!
- Tighten those muscles, Assad!

03:14.626 --> 03:17.676
<i>Carl Mørck.
Leave a message.</i>

03:31.251 --> 03:33.421
I have a new case for you.

03:35.126 --> 03:37.376
A message in a bottle.

03:37.501 --> 03:42.041
- Only you can solve it.
- Who's... that?

03:42.126 --> 03:44.296
- Pasgård.
- Where's Mørck?

03:45.126 --> 03:48.256
You didn't know?
Jacobsen sent him on sick leave.

03:48.376 --> 03:53.586
I don't blame him. He was worn out.
Completely out of reach.

03:53.709 --> 03:57.459
He just sat there,
completely blank.

03:57.584 --> 04:00.334
Well, you know Carl.

04:00.459 --> 04:04.329
- But this time it was really bad.
- Rose...

04:04.459 --> 04:07.539
- Sometimes it's as if...
- Rose!

04:07.668 --> 04:10.458
He's fine.
He'll be back tomorrow.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.423
Where did you get this?

04:14.543 --> 04:17.423
A retired army guy found it
on the coast.

04:17.543 --> 04:21.423
For some reason he thought it better
to hand it over to the police. Have fun.

04:24.501 --> 04:26.621
Nice to meet you.

04:26.751 --> 04:28.791
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:28.918 --> 04:32.328
- I'm Rose.
- Right. Pasgård.

04:35.168 --> 04:37.538
This is blood, isn't it?

04:37.668 --> 04:40.708
Yes. It could be.

04:42.543 --> 04:45.373
- Send it to Microbiology.
- Sure.

05:29.376 --> 05:31.176
Carl.

05:33.793 --> 05:36.793
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:36.918 --> 05:40.578
- The door was open.
- Oh.

05:45.334 --> 05:47.584
What's going on?

05:51.543 --> 05:54.673
You should have been back at work.

05:54.793 --> 05:57.043
Yeah, I... yeah.

06:02.126 --> 06:04.626
- Let's take a walk.
- What?

06:04.751 --> 06:08.211
Put on a clean shirt and let's go.

06:27.251 --> 06:28.831
Yeah...

06:41.084 --> 06:43.374
Remember to fold your hands.

06:45.709 --> 06:51.419
Good Lord.
Almighty Lord. Beautiful Lord.

06:55.334 --> 06:58.334
Hear us, your faithful servants.

06:58.459 --> 07:01.579
Your eternal servants.
The chosen ones.

07:09.043 --> 07:10.963
Elias.

07:12.918 --> 07:14.038
Come.

07:17.168 --> 07:18.538
Come.

07:43.501 --> 07:47.211
I baptize you in the name of the Father.

07:52.043 --> 07:54.543
I baptize you in the name of the Father.

08:57.376 --> 09:00.586
We haven't seen you in church
for a long time.

09:00.709 --> 09:04.959
I know. Time flies.
It must be over a year.

09:06.126 --> 09:08.836
You have a beautiful farm.

09:10.043 --> 09:14.423
Very beautiful, wonderful fields.
Beautiful place.

09:14.543 --> 09:17.293
This isn't a farm anymore.

09:17.418 --> 09:19.538
Just a house.

09:21.168 --> 09:23.788
I had to sell off the land.

09:23.918 --> 09:24.918
We're fine.

09:28.084 --> 09:31.424
Elias got a job at a market garden...

09:32.501 --> 09:36.671
I do the books for the congregation,
so we get by.

09:39.793 --> 09:41.503
Elias.

09:41.626 --> 09:46.466
What's important is to have
your family and your faith.

09:46.584 --> 09:48.334
Yes.

09:50.376 --> 09:52.756
Good night, Mom.

09:53.543 --> 09:56.123
- Good night.
- Good night, Dad.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.418
Good night.

09:59.543 --> 10:02.333
- Good night, Father.
- Good night.

10:05.084 --> 10:10.674
- Is it true?
- Yes.

10:10.793 --> 10:14.623
Magdalena has been named messenger.
For the entire region.

10:15.918 --> 10:17.498
Listen, Magdalena.

10:20.376 --> 10:24.046
You have a light in your heart.

10:24.168 --> 10:27.248
Just like your mother and father.

10:38.584 --> 10:41.624
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:43.709 --> 10:48.329
What can I say? It has been fantastic
to see you again. I am very blessed.

10:48.459 --> 10:50.169
Thank you.

10:50.293 --> 10:53.173
Thank you.
Have a nice trip onwards.

10:53.293 --> 10:58.253
Thank you.
God bless you both and the children.

10:58.376 --> 10:59.756
Thank you.

11:04.543 --> 11:06.503
I guess we'll see you in a year, then.

11:59.876 --> 12:03.926
- "Bus stop". That's easy to read.
- Yes.

12:04.043 --> 12:05.753
And there...

12:07.418 --> 12:09.498
Maybe "children"?

12:10.459 --> 12:13.829
Yes.
"Mom and Dad" is clear.

12:17.043 --> 12:22.123
We know the bottle has been in the sea
for a long time.

12:22.251 --> 12:24.331
The algae are at least six years old.

12:24.459 --> 12:28.419
The letter is written in tar,
so maybe it was thrown from a boat?

12:28.543 --> 12:33.673
A lighthouse. So maybe
it was thrown out close to land.

12:34.751 --> 12:37.791
It <i>is</i> blood on the paper.
A lot of blood, in fact.

12:38.876 --> 12:41.546
And someone's name starts with a P.

12:43.709 --> 12:46.539
I think it was written by a child.

12:46.668 --> 12:51.078
Because... "man" with an E.
"Mom and Dad".

12:52.334 --> 12:56.044
And look at that "us".

12:57.043 --> 12:59.963
"Us up".

13:00.084 --> 13:06.214
And that looks like an L like in "lock".
Doesn't it?

13:06.334 --> 13:09.374
- Right.
- "Locked us up."

13:12.376 --> 13:17.256
Say you need help
and you write a letter.

13:18.751 --> 13:21.501
What would you write first?

13:21.626 --> 13:24.506
- Your location.
- Or your captor.

13:25.626 --> 13:26.506
Yes.

13:28.834 --> 13:32.044
"A man", right?

13:32.168 --> 13:34.368
- "A man called"...
- Right.

13:34.501 --> 13:38.041
A child would write "called" like that.
With an O instead of an A.

13:38.168 --> 13:43.578
Hang on. So it says:
"Jehovah will -

13:43.709 --> 13:45.959
- save us."

13:46.084 --> 13:48.294
"Jehovah will save us."

13:48.418 --> 13:50.368
Jehovah's Witnesses.

13:51.084 --> 13:54.334
Check missing children
within the last 10 years.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.959
I'll send out an email.

13:59.418 --> 14:04.288
Know how many children have gone missing
in Denmark the past 10 years?

14:06.084 --> 14:07.834
Two.

14:09.334 --> 14:12.504
Both times the press had a field day.

14:12.626 --> 14:17.086
But neither a P nor Jehovah's Witnesses
were involved in either case.

14:17.209 --> 14:19.169
Nothing.

14:23.793 --> 14:25.043
Well, thanks, Carl.

14:30.501 --> 14:35.371
Hi, guys.
Quite a mouthful you've laid on me.

14:35.501 --> 14:39.461
I scanned it using seven different
negative color codes and got zilch.

14:39.584 --> 14:42.294
- Infrared was a dud, too.
- So you found nothing?

14:42.418 --> 14:46.458
Wait. Then I thought:
What originally erased the letters?

14:46.584 --> 14:52.044
- Can we see?
- I ended up mixing natrium...

14:53.626 --> 14:55.426
Thanks.

14:57.626 --> 14:59.466
What does that say?

14:59.584 --> 15:03.334
"Lautrupvang".
Sounds like a location.

15:03.459 --> 15:06.579
There's a Lautrupvang in Ballerup.

15:08.584 --> 15:12.374
"There were other children here."

15:15.126 --> 15:18.926
None of our children have disappeared.

15:19.043 --> 15:24.293
- Have any children been abused?
- Well, sadly that's less unusual.

15:24.418 --> 15:28.618
We think it may be
a Jehovah's Witness child.

15:30.126 --> 15:32.336
- Trygve?
- Excuse me?

15:32.459 --> 15:36.789
I had a young Jehovah's Witness boy
called Trygve -

15:36.918 --> 15:40.248
- but he seemed like a happy boy.

15:40.376 --> 15:44.216
- When did he attend the school?
- Just a moment.

15:50.584 --> 15:55.424
Trygve Holdt left this school
in 1st grade at his parents' request.

15:55.543 --> 15:58.713
At his parents' request?
May I see?

16:04.126 --> 16:08.216
It says here the children didn't come
to class on Tuesday morning.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.254
Next day the parents say-

16:10.376 --> 16:13.426
- they sent the children on
a religious revival trip to Australia.

16:13.543 --> 16:16.373
I don't know what goes on
in those people's heads.

16:17.793 --> 16:20.793
Help me understand this.

16:20.918 --> 16:25.038
The children drop out of school
overnight to go to Australia.

16:25.168 --> 16:28.958
They never return,
and no one at school checks up on it?

16:29.084 --> 16:34.214
- There's no need to put it like that.
- How do you want me to put it?

16:34.334 --> 16:36.714
We've done everything by the book.

16:46.626 --> 16:48.676
The children.

16:50.918 --> 16:53.038
You said "the children".

16:54.043 --> 16:56.253
So there must be more than one.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.542
Poul Holdt, 4th grade.

17:08.376 --> 17:12.925
- He must be Trygve's big brother.
- Poul?

17:13.542 --> 17:17.123
Poul Holdt.
You found your P.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.328
Let's just find Poul and his brother.

17:22.459 --> 17:26.329
They're fine.
They're both fine.

17:26.459 --> 17:29.619
They just changed schools
and are going to crack up -

17:29.751 --> 17:33.171
- when they hear we found their message
after all these years.

17:37.168 --> 17:38.788
Yeah...

18:15.959 --> 18:18.249
- Can I see?
- No.

18:22.751 --> 18:28.291
- I'm going to tell on you.
- We're allowed to look at pictures.

18:30.043 --> 18:34.503
Not of short-haired girls with make-up.

18:38.668 --> 18:42.418
- Are you sure you're allowed?
- No.

18:44.168 --> 18:47.118
Look at the moons
on the belt and the shoes.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.921
Hi... hello?

18:51.876 --> 18:54.126
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:54.251 --> 18:57.291
Do you want a ride?

18:57.418 --> 19:01.038
No, it's okay.
We'll walk.

19:21.251 --> 19:23.961
But it's such a long walk.

19:25.043 --> 19:27.373
We're used to it.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.121
What if it rains?

19:33.543 --> 19:36.713
- It's okay.
- Sure you don't want a ride?

19:36.834 --> 19:39.334
You'll be home in two minutes.

19:40.668 --> 19:42.668
I thought you were leaving.

19:42.793 --> 19:45.793
Yes, but I forgot something in church -

19:45.918 --> 19:50.748
- so I thought I'd say goodbye
to your mom and dad before I left.

19:55.668 --> 19:58.958
Sure you don't want a ride?

19:59.084 --> 20:02.754
I'll let you sit up front.
Would you like that?

20:02.876 --> 20:04.216
Okay.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.043
- No!
- Sit down.

20:13.168 --> 20:16.248
- Let me go!
- Sit down.

20:17.418 --> 20:20.328
Let me out! Stop!

20:34.543 --> 20:36.713
Thank you.

20:36.834 --> 20:39.754
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:10.459 --> 21:14.669
T-r-y-g-v-e.
Trygve.

21:14.793 --> 21:20.173
<i>I have his parents' address here.
Christian Holdt, Ballerup.</i>

21:21.501 --> 21:23.671
<i>Oh dear.</i>

21:23.793 --> 21:27.503
<i>He was found dead in his bed
with his wife.</i>

21:27.626 --> 21:31.716
<i>They'd each swallowed what amounts to
six months' supply of sleeping pills.</i>

21:31.834 --> 21:36.504
<i>The theory was that it was
part of a religious ritual.</i>

21:36.626 --> 21:40.926
Jehovah's Witnesses don't have
suicide rituals.

21:41.043 --> 21:43.543
They don't have any rituals.

21:43.668 --> 21:47.458
They just sit there... and talk.

22:20.959 --> 22:24.169
- The cops are here!
- Take it easy.

22:24.293 --> 22:27.793
- Fuck off! Get out.
- What's your name? Sit down.

22:27.918 --> 22:31.668
- Just sit down. Sit down!
- What the fuck are you doing?

22:31.793 --> 22:34.833
- Sit down.
- Sit down! Calm down.

22:34.959 --> 22:38.369
- Don't touch me.
- Calm down. Sit down.

22:38.501 --> 22:41.331
- What's going on?
- Don't talk to them. Trygve!

22:41.459 --> 22:44.289
- Don't say a fucking word.
- Trygve?

22:44.418 --> 22:47.538
We're here about a letter
from your big brother.

22:47.668 --> 22:51.708
What do you mean?
I don't have a big brother.

22:51.834 --> 22:53.044
Trygve...

22:53.126 --> 22:57.046
- We know you have a big brother.
- My big brother went away!

22:57.168 --> 23:00.418
I don't know him.
I don't know where the hell he is.

23:00.543 --> 23:03.333
Fuck off!
Just fuck off!

23:25.126 --> 23:26.966
We wait.

23:49.126 --> 23:51.086
Assad.

24:01.793 --> 24:04.083
Can I see the letter?

24:43.126 --> 24:45.926
- Hi.
- Shit!

24:46.043 --> 24:49.713
- It's you, Christian.
- The door was open.

24:49.834 --> 24:54.084
- Who else should it be?
- I don't know. I'm so glad to see you.

24:57.793 --> 25:02.293
I just hate being by myself.

25:08.418 --> 25:11.668
It smells of rotting seaweed.

25:11.793 --> 25:13.503
And saltwater.

25:31.626 --> 25:35.756
My big brother was there too.
Both of us are tied up.

25:35.876 --> 25:38.426
- But he's alive?
- Yes.

25:40.918 --> 25:43.748
I remember a loud noise.

25:45.376 --> 25:47.716
A constant noise.

25:49.168 --> 25:51.038
Of what?

25:52.709 --> 25:55.169
I don't know.
A factory...

25:56.543 --> 25:58.833
... a road.
I don't know.

26:00.043 --> 26:05.833
The same metallic drone outside.

26:05.959 --> 26:08.039
- Can you recall it?
- What?

26:08.126 --> 26:09.796
Can you recall the sound?

26:11.043 --> 26:12.793
<i>Yes.</i>

26:34.418 --> 26:38.708
The man who took you.
Do you remember what he looked like?

26:49.251 --> 26:51.371
I couldn't do anything.

26:51.501 --> 26:54.831
He forced me to watch it happen.

26:54.959 --> 26:56.619
He took his scissors...

26:58.793 --> 27:01.373
He's dead.

27:01.501 --> 27:05.121
- Poul is dead.
- Shh...

27:06.709 --> 27:09.039
There.

27:09.584 --> 27:12.174
<i>Shh...</i>

27:12.293 --> 27:16.083
<i>- Calm down.
- He stabbed him with the scissors.</i>

27:16.209 --> 27:19.369
<i>They said that if I ever told anyone,
Jehovah would punish me.</i>

27:22.543 --> 27:24.753
Viborg Police Station, hello.

27:26.709 --> 27:31.499
You'll be spending the night here.
Let's talk some more tomorrow, okay?

27:33.376 --> 27:36.756
You didn't see who grabbed the child?

27:36.876 --> 27:39.586
We'll look into it.

27:41.501 --> 27:45.211
A man walking his dog saw a child
being forced into a golden car.

27:49.709 --> 27:53.369
- 8 km west of Skals.
- It could be anything.

27:53.501 --> 27:57.041
An argument,
a playful parent.

28:05.668 --> 28:09.038
I'll send a car to look into it.

28:24.043 --> 28:29.043
- The bottle was found here. There.
- Why stay within that circle?

28:29.168 --> 28:33.328
We eliminated the Kattegat strait.
The currents wouldn't carry it that way.

28:33.459 --> 28:37.539
The boy said the perp spoke Norwegian.
Can't it have come from Norway?

28:37.668 --> 28:41.578
Oceanographic Institute say
all sea currents there go north.

28:41.709 --> 28:44.669
- It's impossible.
- It's a huge area.

28:44.793 --> 28:47.123
We'll just focus on the coast.

28:47.251 --> 28:50.421
It's a bit hard to throw a bottle into
the sea from downtown Herning, right?

28:50.543 --> 28:55.373
- Sure, but there are the inlets...
- And the Wadden Sea.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.921
- If you have a boat...
- Trygve says it wasn't a boat.

28:59.043 --> 29:03.423
It could be a beachfront house,
a boathouse, a shed...

29:03.543 --> 29:05.753
- A houseboat.
- Whatever.

29:05.876 --> 29:07.296
Department Q, Rose speaking.

29:07.418 --> 29:11.288
You hinge your investigation on
a 15-year-old crystal meth addict?

29:11.418 --> 29:15.828
Investigating that area will eat
0.4% of our entire budget.

29:15.959 --> 29:17.829
It's not gonna happen.

29:23.626 --> 29:24.756
Fine.

29:26.126 --> 29:31.046
We'll work on Trygve
and try to narrow it down.

29:31.126 --> 29:34.086
We also have the sound
that Trygve heard.

29:34.209 --> 29:37.579
- We can try to establish what it was.
- Okay, listen.

29:37.709 --> 29:40.419
What are we looking at?
A child disappears.

29:40.543 --> 29:44.213
The parents don't tell a soul.

29:44.334 --> 29:48.084
- That's pretty strange.
- Yeah.

29:48.209 --> 29:50.499
Some sects make their children
do weird stuff.

29:50.626 --> 29:52.046
Sects?

29:52.126 --> 29:55.296
They're Jehovah's Witnesses.
That's...

29:56.168 --> 30:00.038
- What the hell?
- And it happened this morning? Hang on.

30:00.126 --> 30:03.046
Viborg Police, responding to our email.

30:03.126 --> 30:07.506
A witness saw a child being forced into
a car outside a village called Skals.

30:07.626 --> 30:10.546
Guess what that village houses.

30:10.668 --> 30:13.418
A religious sect,
The Lord's Disciples.

30:13.543 --> 30:17.043
- We have to check it out.
- What's the problem?

30:17.126 --> 30:20.796
- Let Viborg Police do it.
- Marcus!

30:22.626 --> 30:28.216
Extend my leave by a couple of days.
I want to visit relatives in Jutland.

30:28.334 --> 30:30.754
Right, man.
You haven't seen them in ages.

30:30.876 --> 30:33.966
- Uncle Jørgen?
- Right. He's got eye trouble.

30:34.084 --> 30:35.624
- Aunt Esther.
- Her too.

30:35.751 --> 30:38.581
- All of them.
- Suffer from cataracts.

30:38.709 --> 30:41.419
What a shame. That's bad.

30:43.084 --> 30:45.624
I feel sorry for them.

30:59.418 --> 31:04.498
The Lord's Disciples believe
Jesus was born in Texas.

31:04.626 --> 31:07.426
We're obviously dealing with retards.

31:09.126 --> 31:12.256
It's great to have you
back at work, Carl.

31:12.376 --> 31:15.046
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Spare me this conversation.

31:15.126 --> 31:19.216
- What conversation?
- This one. Faith is many things.

31:19.334 --> 31:23.174
It's all the same.
Jesus born in Texas. God in heaven.

31:23.293 --> 31:26.963
Some guy in a cave thinks he's a prophet
because a winged man told him so.

31:27.084 --> 31:30.464
- It's psychotic.
- So you think I'm psychotic?

31:30.584 --> 31:33.294
When it comes to that issue, yes.

31:35.709 --> 31:40.289
Carl, we go back several years. You've
never taken an interest in my faith.

31:40.418 --> 31:43.248
I hoped you'd come to your senses.

31:43.376 --> 31:46.546
That it was a bad habit,
like smoking and homosexuality.

31:51.168 --> 31:54.618
Carl, I don't believe
that I'm going to Paradise -

31:54.751 --> 31:57.961
- or up to meet my family when I die.

31:58.084 --> 32:01.124
But I believe in something
larger than us -

32:01.251 --> 32:04.711
- and that makes me happy.
Get it?

32:04.834 --> 32:09.254
It doesn't mean I'll switch off my brain
or grow a navel-length beard.

32:12.459 --> 32:16.709
- Something larger than us?
- Yes, Carl. It's not all that strange.

32:16.834 --> 32:20.294
Most people in the world share
that belief, man.

32:20.418 --> 32:22.208
As long as they don't kill each other.

32:22.334 --> 32:24.794
- That's just so fucking easy.
- The truth is easy.

32:24.918 --> 32:28.958
What do you want, Carl?
Do you want me to join your religion?

32:29.084 --> 32:32.214
- Watch your blood pressure.
- You believe in a black hole.

32:32.334 --> 32:36.044
That nothing means anything.
No thanks.

32:37.209 --> 32:42.419
I'm just saying: With that attitude
you'll never enjoy a pork roast.

32:46.959 --> 32:49.369
That's not funny.

32:59.168 --> 33:00.828
Hi.

33:00.959 --> 33:03.119
- Assad.
- Lisa.

33:03.251 --> 33:07.421
You don't waste time. You do know
nobody's been reported missing?

33:07.543 --> 33:10.623
- Yes.
- Is that a list of the congregation?

33:10.751 --> 33:12.291
Yes.

33:13.334 --> 33:17.294
I've marked all the families
with school-age children.

33:17.418 --> 33:20.958
- There, there and there.
- Thanks.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.713
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:35.084 --> 33:36.254
Excuse me?

33:37.834 --> 33:39.964
What did you expect?

33:40.084 --> 33:43.124
That we'd let you interrogate people
without anyone from the local police?

33:43.251 --> 33:44.581
Yes.

33:52.251 --> 33:55.251
- So you're a social worker or what?
- No, I'm an investigator.

33:59.376 --> 34:03.336
But we can talk about your childhood
if you want to.

35:00.751 --> 35:03.751
We're with the police.
Carl Mørck.

35:03.876 --> 35:06.586
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

35:14.126 --> 35:15.506
What do you want?

35:17.418 --> 35:21.078
We're asking people around here
if they've seen anything unusual lately.

35:22.668 --> 35:26.248
A witness saw a child
being forced into a car.

35:26.376 --> 35:29.836
We want to hear
if anyone's seen anything.

35:29.959 --> 35:32.039
No, I haven't.

35:33.793 --> 35:38.173
You have two children, right?
Samuel and Magdalena.

35:40.084 --> 35:42.544
- They aren't here.
- No?

35:42.668 --> 35:46.418
No, they're with...
their aunt in Sweden.

35:47.918 --> 35:50.418
Excuse me.
May we come in for a moment?

35:50.543 --> 35:54.043
We don't let strangers in.
Especially not his kind.

35:55.334 --> 35:57.424
His kind?

35:58.876 --> 36:01.086
Because he's a city boy?

36:02.959 --> 36:06.369
We're in the middle of prayers.
As I said, I haven't seen anything.

36:06.501 --> 36:08.121
Bye.

36:18.293 --> 36:21.123
That sure as hell wasn't normal.

36:34.709 --> 36:39.079
You have to be quiet.
Hush... Be quiet.

36:39.209 --> 36:41.959
I don't care about being quiet!

36:58.959 --> 37:02.079
- No, it was lower.
- You mean deeper?

37:03.918 --> 37:06.328
Let's pitch it down a little.

37:27.126 --> 37:29.506
What do you do outside work?

37:31.376 --> 37:34.046
You're asking me?

37:35.834 --> 37:39.044
Why do you ask?

37:39.126 --> 37:43.676
- You must have interests.
- Sure, I have lots of interests.

37:52.126 --> 37:54.376
I'll get a beer.

37:58.709 --> 38:03.079
- Yeah, she's nice, Carl.
- What?

38:05.084 --> 38:09.124
When was the last time
you asked a girl out?

38:10.126 --> 38:12.716
Must be about a week ago.

38:12.834 --> 38:15.794
You haven't seen anyone
since your divorce.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.958
No, exactly.

38:19.084 --> 38:21.834
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

38:32.501 --> 38:34.711
What's going on?
It's Wednesday night.

38:34.834 --> 38:38.254
It's a public holiday tomorrow.
Ascension Day.

38:40.376 --> 38:42.966
What?

38:43.084 --> 38:47.044
What day were Poul and Trygve kidnapped?

38:48.834 --> 38:51.214
11 May 2008.

38:51.334 --> 38:54.674
Could that be Whit Sunday?

38:54.793 --> 38:57.623
We think he kidnaps the children
around religious holidays.

38:57.751 --> 39:01.121
- Do a national search.
- Good to meet you, Lisa.

39:01.251 --> 39:07.171
Everyone. Even a mere scrape at the E.R.
Within a week of all religious holidays.

39:07.293 --> 39:11.923
<i>Carl, shut up and listen!
December 2008:</i>

39:12.043 --> 39:15.213
A member of House of Christ in Rønde,
Birgit Torp -

39:15.334 --> 39:18.834
- reports her two daughters missing.
Later that night-

39:18.959 --> 39:21.329
<i>- she calls off the alarm.</i>

39:21.459 --> 39:25.669
<i>The family now lives in Thailand
except the youngest daughter, Cecilie.</i>

39:25.793 --> 39:29.423
<i>She seems to have vanished
from the face of the earth.</i>

39:29.543 --> 39:32.043
- Rose found one more.
<i>- That's not all.</i>

39:33.251 --> 39:37.621
You asked me to find something
on Elias and Rakel Steensgaard.

39:38.751 --> 39:40.831
<i>And I sure have.</i>

40:00.293 --> 40:02.503
No, let me just...

40:05.126 --> 40:08.086
Let me open this.

41:25.543 --> 41:28.373
Your eternal servant.

41:28.501 --> 41:32.041
Your servant.
Your eternal servant.

41:33.209 --> 41:36.249
Hear our prayer to you now.

41:37.293 --> 41:40.423
We need you, Lord.
We need you.

42:09.168 --> 42:12.828
I looked at your magazine.

42:21.251 --> 42:22.501
Look at it.

42:27.418 --> 42:29.328
Look at it.

42:33.043 --> 42:36.673
What do you think
Mom and Dad would say to that?

42:46.793 --> 42:49.503
Look at me.

43:13.376 --> 43:16.126
Only God can help you now.

43:18.959 --> 43:23.249
You must pray to God
to save you now.

43:30.126 --> 43:31.796
Pray!

43:33.376 --> 43:37.546
Your servant.
Your eternal servant.

43:37.668 --> 43:40.168
Your servant.
Your eternal servant.

43:40.293 --> 43:44.503
Our Father, which art in Heaven.

43:44.626 --> 43:47.426
Hallowed be thy Name.

43:47.543 --> 43:51.423
Stop speaking in your father's language.
I won't hear it anymore!

43:51.543 --> 43:53.463
Again!

43:53.584 --> 43:56.834
- Our Father...
- In Danish, I said! Again!

44:02.876 --> 44:04.176
Stop it!

44:18.293 --> 44:21.043
Elias, we need to talk.

44:22.793 --> 44:27.173
- I have to go to work.
- You've liquidated all your capital.

44:27.293 --> 44:33.083
Pensions, company funds, Rakel's
parents. 670,000 kroner all in all.

44:33.209 --> 44:35.829
What do you need that money for?

44:36.793 --> 44:41.793
Listen to me. We had a neighbor
check on your sister in Sweden.

44:41.918 --> 44:44.918
Not a child in sight, Elias.

44:45.043 --> 44:46.463
Listen...

44:47.918 --> 44:53.368
Stay out of this! How did you
find out about all this? Who are you?

44:53.501 --> 44:58.291
Take it easy, man. We just want to know
what happened to Samuel and Magdalena.

44:58.418 --> 45:02.248
You don't get it! If he finds out
I talked to the police...

45:02.376 --> 45:05.796
- Stop, Elias!
- This isn't his first time.

45:05.918 --> 45:09.668
Last time
only one of the children came back.

45:19.293 --> 45:21.923
So let's talk!

45:22.043 --> 45:23.963
Talk!

45:24.084 --> 45:26.794
But I won't talk to him.

45:26.918 --> 45:31.038
They're here for the children's sake.
Don't you see?

45:34.043 --> 45:36.123
Come in.

45:43.584 --> 45:45.584
Both of you.

45:47.543 --> 45:49.173
Carl.

45:50.168 --> 45:53.038
- What?
- Shoes.

45:59.876 --> 46:03.426
This is the children's room.

46:05.418 --> 46:08.668
Magdalena sleeps there.
Samuel.

46:34.251 --> 46:36.331
What...

46:36.459 --> 46:41.459
We hadn't even started worrying
about them when he called.

46:43.043 --> 46:46.923
- He called you here?
- Yes.

46:50.376 --> 46:54.126
- And he spoke Norwegian?
- Yes.

46:54.251 --> 46:58.421
- Yes?
- He said he had Magdalena and Samuel.

46:58.543 --> 47:02.253
And he told us
to withdraw all our money.

47:03.709 --> 47:07.209
He knew exactly how much we had.

47:07.334 --> 47:12.294
What did he sound like on the phone?
Young? Old?

47:13.459 --> 47:17.209
But we know him.
His name is Johannes.

47:21.751 --> 47:24.041
You know him?

47:24.168 --> 47:25.748
Yes.

47:27.543 --> 47:29.543
Yes.

47:58.043 --> 48:02.043
He's been to the church
a few times over the last 2-3 years.

48:02.126 --> 48:04.756
He claimed to be a missionary
from the congregation.

48:04.876 --> 48:09.176
He had dinner with us the day before
yesterday. Right where you're sitting.

48:10.334 --> 48:13.424
Johannes probably isn't his real name.

48:13.543 --> 48:16.463
You haven't got a picture of him?

48:16.584 --> 48:20.794
- No.
- How does he want the money delivered?

48:20.918 --> 48:26.248
I'm to put it in a bag and get on
a train for Hamburg tonight at 7:15.

48:27.418 --> 48:31.078
He'll call me on the way
and tell me where to hide the bag -

48:31.209 --> 48:35.079
- and then I'm to get off
at the next stop.

48:35.209 --> 48:39.919
As soon he has the money, he'll release
the children where they can be found.

48:40.043 --> 48:44.123
If we don't do as he says
or if we tell anyone -

48:44.251 --> 48:47.081
- he's going to kill them.

48:48.293 --> 48:52.423
But not until he's made sure
they can't go to Paradise.

48:54.793 --> 48:56.673
He's going to...

48:57.501 --> 49:00.171
... do things to them.

49:01.751 --> 49:03.211
So...

49:04.626 --> 49:08.296
You see why we can't involve you.

49:09.543 --> 49:11.213
Right.

49:14.168 --> 49:18.038
You're still to deliver the money,
but we have to be there.

49:18.126 --> 49:20.796
- No.
- No. What if he sees you?

49:20.918 --> 49:25.578
He won't see us. We won't intervene
until we're sure we can catch him.

49:25.709 --> 49:29.369
- He's done this before.
- I won't have it!

49:29.501 --> 49:34.621
- He's killed one child. Maybe more.
- But I won't have it!

49:34.751 --> 49:39.041
The other children's parents let him get
away with it and haven't told a soul -

49:39.126 --> 49:43.426
- because they had more faith in God
than in the police. I'll ask you again:

49:43.543 --> 49:47.423
Can you live with not lifting a finger
to save your children?

49:47.543 --> 49:49.503
Carl, take it easy.

49:49.626 --> 49:52.506
- Can you?
- Take it easy, Carl.

49:54.543 --> 49:55.963
Elias?

50:00.834 --> 50:03.124
They're your children.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.288
You decide.

50:09.376 --> 50:11.336
But Carl is right.

50:11.459 --> 50:14.789
Unless we stop him now -

50:14.918 --> 50:18.618
- you won't see
both your children again.

50:37.793 --> 50:39.423
No.

50:39.543 --> 50:42.423
- No...
- Yes, Elias.

50:46.501 --> 50:48.501
- Yes.
- No.

50:50.959 --> 50:53.499
We can't do it on our own.

51:14.501 --> 51:17.041
If anything goes wrong...

51:19.418 --> 51:22.788
... and you're to blame...

51:28.334 --> 51:31.374
I promise we'll do everything
in our power.

51:33.293 --> 51:38.173
11 stations between Hadsten and Hamburg.
We'll have two men on each platform.

51:38.293 --> 51:41.753
Two men will board in Randers,
one will board with Elias -

51:41.876 --> 51:47.046
- and two patrol cars will follow
the train in case he escapes in a car.

51:47.168 --> 51:50.788
- 25 plain-clothes officers.
- That's <i>plain</i> clothes.

51:50.918 --> 51:55.708
- No windbreakers and skinny jeans.
- Fine. I'll put on a blue suit.

51:55.834 --> 52:01.464
We have 5 hours to get everyone
in place, so you'd better get moving.

52:01.584 --> 52:04.924
We need a helicopter
in case something goes wrong.

52:05.043 --> 52:09.753
If we lose sight of him, or he sends
someone to get the bag in his place.

52:09.876 --> 52:13.506
- Will Carl and Assad be on board?
- No, in one of the cars.

52:13.626 --> 52:19.926
What am I missing here? 28 men
and a helicopter to handle one arrest?

52:20.043 --> 52:25.673
We're dealing with a ransom case.
We don't even know if he's armed.

52:25.793 --> 52:30.253
- We don't think it's about the money.
- He's toying with these families.

52:30.376 --> 52:33.836
He spends years making friends
before abducting the children -

52:33.959 --> 52:35.959
- always on religious holidays.

52:36.084 --> 52:39.124
He made a 7-year-old boy watch
his brother's murder.

52:39.251 --> 52:43.751
We know of at least one sibling pair,
in 2008, where a girl disappeared.

52:43.876 --> 52:48.046
He's not a kidnapper.
He's a serial killer.

52:48.126 --> 52:51.926
If we lose him tonight,
we may lose one of the children.

52:52.043 --> 52:55.173
Maybe both.

52:55.293 --> 52:59.173
Anything else... before we engage?

52:59.293 --> 53:01.503
We know he speaks Norwegian.

53:01.626 --> 53:04.716
Other than that,
we only have this sketch.

53:04.834 --> 53:08.964
He left no leads for us,
neither now nor in 2008.

53:09.834 --> 53:14.254
He called Elias and Rakel from a stolen
cell that was later found in a ditch.

53:14.376 --> 53:17.426
This guy isn't stupid.

53:31.084 --> 53:34.254
- I have to go now.
- Yes.

53:35.418 --> 53:37.668
- See you.
- Yes.

54:10.834 --> 54:13.174
<i>Chopper 1 here.</i>

54:13.293 --> 54:17.543
<i>- Helicopter 1 calling Carl Mørck.</i>
- Mørck here.

54:17.668 --> 54:20.538
<i>Have you
checked out the train route?</i>

54:20.668 --> 54:24.918
The road takes us
up to 4 km from the train.

54:27.293 --> 54:30.963
Remember to say "Heli, Bravo,
Whiskey, over and out," Carl.

54:31.084 --> 54:34.424
- What?
- Or else he can't understand you.

54:34.543 --> 54:36.753
I'm not 12.
"Hello Bravo", what?

54:36.876 --> 54:40.926
"Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out", or
they don't know you're talking to them.

54:41.043 --> 54:43.173
It's important!

54:44.709 --> 54:46.619
Heli, Bravo, Whiskey, over and out.

54:46.751 --> 54:48.961
<i>Yeah right, Carl.</i>

54:51.876 --> 54:54.256
Funny!

54:54.376 --> 54:58.676
<i>- Stop joking around.</i>
- Sure. Sorry.

55:38.209 --> 55:43.039
- Rakel, can I give you a hand?
- Distribute the Bibles.

55:57.293 --> 56:00.373
The train is pulling in.

56:01.376 --> 56:03.836
Elias... ready?

56:13.959 --> 56:15.829
Elias...

56:46.126 --> 56:51.086
<i>The train to Hamburg
will be arriving shortly.</i>

56:59.834 --> 57:04.544
Need a ticket?
The ticket machine is right over there.

57:09.543 --> 57:13.373
- Stop glancing around.
- Thanks.

57:15.209 --> 57:19.499
I'm glad <i>you</i> came with me. Why
do the Danish police hire all kinds?

57:20.626 --> 57:23.756
Beats me.

57:23.876 --> 57:26.216
Stop glancing around.

57:26.959 --> 57:32.169
He might board the train here,
so from now on we don't talk.

57:32.293 --> 57:33.373
Have a nice trip.

57:39.251 --> 57:43.621
Why did the message in a bottle
wind up with us, Carl?

57:43.751 --> 57:47.081
I mean, why now?

57:48.751 --> 57:53.041
Right before all this happens?

57:53.126 --> 57:56.756
If we hadn't got it, we'd never have
known Samuel and Magdalena were taken.

58:00.668 --> 58:04.788
We can save two children because we got
a letter that's been at sea for 8 years.

58:04.918 --> 58:09.458
Are you trying to say that God sent us
that message in a bottle?

58:12.584 --> 58:16.294
What if it's true, Carl?
If there is a force that protects us?

58:16.418 --> 58:20.788
Standing by in railcar 23,
seats 33 and 34.

58:20.918 --> 58:25.038
That propels us all toward good
if only we're open to it?

58:25.126 --> 58:28.296
- Cut the crap.
- Stop calling it crap, Carl.

58:28.418 --> 58:31.078
Do you want to talk about goblins, too?

58:31.209 --> 58:35.039
If you want to be my friend, stop being
so fucking arrogant about my faith.

58:35.126 --> 58:40.466
You're embarrassing. How can a bright
guy like you believe in that nonsense?

58:40.584 --> 58:45.044
It's a bit hard to take your opinion
on right and wrong seriously.

58:45.126 --> 58:49.086
You've got half your life left,
and you've already given up.

58:49.209 --> 58:52.749
Don't you ever ponder
the mysteries of life?

58:57.668 --> 58:58.958
No.

59:31.334 --> 59:35.674
<i>Chopper 1 here. The train is
departing from Hadsten station.</i>

01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:27.463
He's calling.

01:00:28.459 --> 01:00:32.499
- How far are we?
- 2 km away.

01:00:36.834 --> 01:00:39.374
- Yes.
- They've made contact.

01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:42.041
- I see him.
<i>- What railcar are you in?</i>

01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:46.421
- 22.
<i>- Go to the nearest restroom.</i>

01:00:49.959 --> 01:00:52.169
<i>You have 30 seconds to get there.</i>

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:55.084
Let me talk to them first.

01:00:55.209 --> 01:00:58.789
<i>You've got 30 seconds to get there!
Don't ask me again.</i>

01:01:00.834 --> 01:01:05.584
<i>Elias, focus.
Go to the nearest restroom.</i>

01:01:17.543 --> 01:01:20.583
- Where are we?
- Take the next right.

01:01:20.709 --> 01:01:25.619
<i>In front of you on the right you'll
find a red handle next to the door.</i>

01:01:25.751 --> 01:01:28.581
<i>- Hold it down to force the door open.</i>
- What?

01:01:28.709 --> 01:01:32.039
<i>- Do it.</i>
- I can't.

01:01:32.126 --> 01:01:35.506
<i>No more questions!
Do as I say, now.</i>

01:01:37.418 --> 01:01:40.538
- He's opening the door.
- What door?

01:01:46.334 --> 01:01:48.964
<i>He opened the outer door!</i>

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:53.044
He isn't on the train.
He isn't on the train!

01:01:56.043 --> 01:02:00.123
<i>- Pasgård, which side?
- He opened the outer door.</i>

01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:06.213
- Pasgård, which side?
- Right. What are my instructions?

01:02:06.334 --> 01:02:08.674
<i>Don't make a move yet.</i>

01:02:08.793 --> 01:02:12.753
<i>- Prepare to throw the bag.</i>
- Assure me you'll free both of them.

01:02:12.876 --> 01:02:17.256
<i>What do you mean both of them?
Who said you'd get both of them back?</i>

01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:27.714
We have visual of the train again.
We can see Elias.

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:32.584
<i>In 15 seconds you'll pass a gate and
a forest. Prepare to throw the bag.</i>

01:02:32.709 --> 01:02:35.619
- I want to see them first!
<i>- Elias.</i>

01:02:35.751 --> 01:02:39.371
<i>Do you want to see
your children again or not?</i>

01:02:39.501 --> 01:02:43.961
- You're mad! I know you're lying!
<i>- Do as I say, damn it!</i>

01:02:44.084 --> 01:02:45.544
Elias.

01:02:59.584 --> 01:03:01.794
- Where's the next crossing?
- What?

01:03:01.918 --> 01:03:05.578
- The next crossing?
- In 2 km.

01:03:05.709 --> 01:03:09.539
<i>The train is heading for the forest
where our view will be restricted.</i>

01:03:09.668 --> 01:03:12.288
<i>Throw the bag in three seconds.</i>

01:03:12.418 --> 01:03:16.618
<i>I'll kill them if you don't throw it.
Now!</i>

01:03:19.584 --> 01:03:20.964
Hello?

01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:27.829
Elias!

01:03:32.418 --> 01:03:34.118
Fuck!

01:03:34.251 --> 01:03:36.041
He jumped!

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:40.216
<i>A man jumped from the train.
We have no visual contact.</i>

01:03:51.543 --> 01:03:52.043
Carl!

01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:56.924
What the fuck are you doing, Carl?

01:03:57.043 --> 01:03:59.673
What?
God's protecting us, isn't he?

01:04:02.584 --> 01:04:06.044
<i>I repeat: A man jumped from the train.</i>

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:11.208
- What did that mean?
- Rakel, calm down.

01:04:12.459 --> 01:04:14.829
Calm down, Rakel. Sit down.
Come here.

01:04:32.709 --> 01:04:35.829
Carl, where are you?

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:39.709
Carl, come in.
Where are you?

01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:13.711
Elias.

01:05:17.709 --> 01:05:19.959
Where are my children?

01:05:40.793 --> 01:05:43.423
Do you see me now?

01:05:51.959 --> 01:05:53.539
Elias!

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:56.124
Elias!

01:06:39.501 --> 01:06:40.541
Carl!

01:06:50.334 --> 01:06:52.754
Carl, get the helicopter!

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:56.046
There's nothing to see.

01:06:56.126 --> 01:06:57.466
Where are you?

01:06:57.584 --> 01:07:00.674
- Send the helicopter back!
<i>- What?</i>

01:07:00.793 --> 01:07:04.293
<i>Elias must go to the hospital asap!</i>

01:07:05.293 --> 01:07:07.423
Elias? Elias?

01:07:57.251 --> 01:08:00.581
<i>The police won't disclose much
about the operation -</i>

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:04.369
<i>- which apparently went very wrong
and ended with -</i>

01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:08.921
<i>- a man about 40 years old jumping off
the train to Hamburg earlier tonight.</i>

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:12.793
<i>There are speculations as to
whether it is a ransom case.</i>

01:08:12.918 --> 01:08:18.957
<i>Witnesses say the man's two children
haven't been in school for some days.</i>

01:08:19.084 --> 01:08:21.544
<i>We have unique footage
of the incident...</i>

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:29.118
Why...

01:08:29.251 --> 01:08:32.581
Why is it my children...?

01:08:35.876 --> 01:08:38.086
Why?

01:08:40.084 --> 01:08:42.964
You promised to help.

01:08:45.376 --> 01:08:47.586
You promised.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:52.506
And now Elias is lying upstairs.

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:56.368
My children...

01:09:00.792 --> 01:09:03.252
I won't see them again.

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.669
And it's your fault.

01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:57.753
You did everything you could,
and she knows that.

01:10:13.876 --> 01:10:17.716
How long have you had that, Carl?

01:10:17.834 --> 01:10:19.504
What?

01:10:19.626 --> 01:10:24.376
I've seen a lot of our colleagues
who've been through nasty things.

01:10:27.918 --> 01:10:33.828
You need help, Carl.
You're shaking like a leaf.

01:10:33.959 --> 01:10:35.499
Oh.

01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:40.423
I'd better do something about that.

01:10:56.543 --> 01:11:02.043
<i>Better infrastructure in the countries
will bring long-term investments -</i>

01:11:02.126 --> 01:11:06.926
<i>- beneficial to
the people's interests.</i>

01:11:07.043 --> 01:11:11.293
<i>In the case of the two kidnapped
children, we've been unable -</i>

01:11:11.418 --> 01:11:17.418
<i>- to get a statement from the head
of the investigation, Carl Mørck.</i>

01:11:29.959 --> 01:11:32.459
Look at me.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.336
Look at me.

01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:43.671
Do you see me?

01:12:08.584 --> 01:12:10.674
Yes, please.

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:14.963
- Yes, please. Yes, please...
- Hi.

01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:19.424
Who are you talking to?
What's going on, Christian?

01:12:30.459 --> 01:12:33.789
I'd date it to around 1993-96.

01:12:33.918 --> 01:12:36.538
Can you zoom in?

01:12:38.084 --> 01:12:41.374
- Look at her eyes.
- Yes.

01:12:45.209 --> 01:12:50.039
- Did they find any prints in Vejle?
- No matches in the database.

01:12:50.126 --> 01:12:53.126
Neither in Denmark nor in I.F.A.D.

01:13:05.876 --> 01:13:07.256
Yes?

01:13:07.376 --> 01:13:13.296
<i>There's a man on the line claiming
to have info about the children.</i>

01:13:13.418 --> 01:13:16.418
<i>- Should I put him through?</i>
- Yes.

01:13:18.543 --> 01:13:21.373
- Hello.
<i>- What do you believe in?</i>

01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:26.041
- Who is this?
<i>- Are you a man of faith, Carl Mørck?</i>

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:28.288
Yes.

01:13:28.418 --> 01:13:32.418
<i>You've done a very stupid thing.
But I'm sure you know that.</i>

01:13:32.543 --> 01:13:35.543
Yes. I know.

01:13:36.834 --> 01:13:41.334
- We should have let you be.
<i>- I'd say that's a correct assumption.</i>

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:44.039
I don't blame you for being angry.

01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:47.038
<i>Both of the children will die now -</i>

01:13:47.168 --> 01:13:51.038
<i>- and it's your fault, Carl.</i>

01:13:52.459 --> 01:13:55.709
<i>I think your focus is more on me
than on the children.</i>

01:13:55.834 --> 01:14:00.214
What do you want?
Just tell me what you want.

01:14:00.334 --> 01:14:03.714
<i>- So maybe we'll meet.</i>
- Hello? Hello!

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.546
Hello?

01:15:46.543 --> 01:15:49.213
He's here.

01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:55.716
He's here at the hospital.
He's here. He's here!

01:15:55.834 --> 01:15:57.374
- Seal off all exits.
- What?

01:15:57.501 --> 01:15:59.371
Seal off all exits.

01:16:01.084 --> 01:16:02.714
Elias...

01:16:04.834 --> 01:16:07.834
Mrs. Steensgaard, he's waking up.

01:16:16.834 --> 01:16:19.044
He needs a doctor...

01:16:52.834 --> 01:16:56.754
What's going on in there?
Why didn't we hear the alarm?

01:17:00.543 --> 01:17:04.583
- Hello. Can you hear me?
- Elias, are you there? Can you hear me?

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:08.499
- I need help.
- We need to get a doctor.

01:17:14.959 --> 01:17:18.039
Intensive ward 3-14.
We need a doctor.

01:17:18.168 --> 01:17:20.748
- Elias!
- Immediately.

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:36.464
We've got a pulse.
20 over 21.

01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:42.369
- Johannes? Johannes? I know.
- One, two, three, lift!

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:46.039
What?

01:17:51.751 --> 01:17:52.711
Pulse?

01:17:52.834 --> 01:17:56.124
White coat?
Was he wearing a white coat?

01:18:05.459 --> 01:18:09.419
- Yes?
<i>- Carl. He's disguised as a doctor.</i>

01:18:09.543 --> 01:18:13.753
- What?
<i>- He's wearing a white coat.</i>

01:18:13.876 --> 01:18:17.046
<i>Carl, he's wearing a white coat.</i>

01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:18.248
Behind you.

01:18:21.168 --> 01:18:23.958
- Carl!
- Elias, stay with me.

01:18:24.084 --> 01:18:27.714
Elias.
Call in a cardiac arrest team.

01:18:29.043 --> 01:18:32.123
Would you like a priest?
Have you got a priest here?

01:18:32.251 --> 01:18:35.831
- Yes.
- Is an ordinary priest okay?

01:18:50.709 --> 01:18:54.209
Stay clear of the patient.

01:18:54.334 --> 01:18:56.424
One, two, three...

01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:15.079
Come.

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.543
Lock the door!

01:19:26.959 --> 01:19:28.419
In there!

01:20:33.168 --> 01:20:34.958
Pasgård?

01:20:59.793 --> 01:21:01.423
Pasgård!

01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:22.499
No, no, no!
Pasgård... Pasgård!

01:21:22.626 --> 01:21:26.796
Calm down.
What can I do? What can I do?

01:21:27.918 --> 01:21:31.708
Send paramedics to the parking house,
level 3. Now!

01:21:31.834 --> 01:21:33.924
Carl, where are you?

01:21:36.043 --> 01:21:40.333
Carl! Carl, god damn it!
Fuck! Fuck!

01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:50.426
HYDROCHLORIC ACID

01:22:52.959 --> 01:22:56.829
- He hasn't done anything.
- Haven't you done anything wrong?

01:22:57.709 --> 01:23:00.959
- We haven't done anything wrong!
- God doesn't want you!

01:23:01.084 --> 01:23:03.044
We haven't done anything!

01:23:20.918 --> 01:23:24.828
- Where the hell is he?
- It's the last footage I have of him.

01:23:26.918 --> 01:23:29.538
And then he's gone.

01:23:29.668 --> 01:23:34.418
- Not on level 4 nor in the basement.
- Did you check the cars?

01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:39.579
Where the hell are you, Carl?

01:23:40.918 --> 01:23:42.788
There.

01:23:44.543 --> 01:23:47.123
That cabriolet.

01:23:48.376 --> 01:23:51.176
It's not registered to any of the staff.

01:23:51.293 --> 01:23:56.583
We have a license plate:
YJ 47512.

01:23:57.543 --> 01:24:00.923
Mia Hansen.
It's a 30-minute drive from here.

01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:05.669
Okay, we want you all to listen to this.

01:24:06.793 --> 01:24:11.083
Trygve, who was kidnapped eight years
ago, has identified this as the sound -

01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:13.669
- he heard day and night
during his captivity.

01:24:13.793 --> 01:24:17.373
It's our only lead
to where the children may be.

01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:24.711
I know...

01:24:26.876 --> 01:24:30.336
... there's a risk
we won't find them...

01:24:34.293 --> 01:24:36.793
... or Carl alive.

01:25:27.751 --> 01:25:31.171
- We've eliminated various factories...
- Could it be a generator?

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:34.623
No, a generator has a higher tempo,
more constant.

01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:37.751
Maybe his recollection isn't precise...

01:25:41.793 --> 01:25:45.423
You said it was near a boathouse,
so it must be near the sea, right?

01:25:45.543 --> 01:25:47.673
Yes.

01:25:47.793 --> 01:25:50.173
I think I know what it is.

01:26:55.251 --> 01:26:56.211
Hi, Rose.

01:26:56.334 --> 01:27:01.044
Trygve's sound may be a wind turbine.
We're listing residences in the circle -

01:27:01.168 --> 01:27:05.668
<i>- where you might hear wind turbines.
There are still many possibilities...</i>

01:27:05.793 --> 01:27:06.623
Good, Rose.

01:27:29.168 --> 01:27:30.368
Becca.

01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:42.959
Rebecca Henriksen?

01:27:43.084 --> 01:27:47.044
- Assad. I'm with the police.
- Is anything wrong?

01:27:47.126 --> 01:27:49.216
May I come in for moment?

01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:53.579
My brother speaks Norwegian.

01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:57.669
- But his name is Thomas.
- Where does he live?

01:27:57.793 --> 01:28:02.083
He travels a lot. He's been living
in Germany the past couple of years.

01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:05.499
He's CEO of a pharmaceutical company.

01:28:05.626 --> 01:28:09.046
He bought me this house.

01:28:10.168 --> 01:28:13.578
He's always taken good care of me.

01:28:13.709 --> 01:28:17.169
We're looking for a man
who kidnapped two children -

01:28:17.293 --> 01:28:21.253
- from a sect called
The Lord's Disciples.

01:28:22.793 --> 01:28:26.673
He's done it many times before.

01:28:26.793 --> 01:28:27.793
Yes...

01:28:27.918 --> 01:28:32.668
Always siblings
from very religious families.

01:28:32.793 --> 01:28:37.713
- I heard it on the news this morning.
- Rebecca...

01:28:37.834 --> 01:28:40.754
Could it be your brother?

01:28:42.209 --> 01:28:44.329
Rebecca.

01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:53.249
He doesn't live in Germany.

01:28:53.376 --> 01:28:56.046
He has a place in Denmark
near the sea.

01:29:24.293 --> 01:29:27.253
She says he has a boathouse
by the North Sea.

01:29:27.376 --> 01:29:29.836
Start with places near wind turbines.

01:29:43.834 --> 01:29:48.174
<i>Continue up the coast
and then head north west.</i>

01:30:36.376 --> 01:30:39.126
Don't mind her.

01:30:39.251 --> 01:30:42.961
It's just you and me now.

01:30:43.084 --> 01:30:47.294
Do you know what I am?

01:30:47.418 --> 01:30:49.168
You've done this before.

01:30:49.293 --> 01:30:53.293
One thing at a time.
Answer my question first.

01:30:53.418 --> 01:30:56.248
Do you know what I am?

01:30:59.709 --> 01:31:01.079
No.

01:31:03.334 --> 01:31:06.464
I'm the Devil's son.

01:31:10.251 --> 01:31:12.961
- I know what it sounds like.
- No...

01:31:13.084 --> 01:31:16.044
I know what it sounds like.

01:31:16.126 --> 01:31:21.046
I don't think
I'm the Devil's only chosen son -

01:31:21.168 --> 01:31:24.748
- because I'm not.
I'm one of his many sons.

01:31:24.876 --> 01:31:28.216
You could call us his soldiers.

01:31:31.501 --> 01:31:34.331
The Devil's?

01:31:34.459 --> 01:31:36.459
Satan's?

01:31:36.584 --> 01:31:39.714
So that's why you do this?

01:32:12.626 --> 01:32:14.586
Hey...

01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:18.459
He came to me when I needed him most.

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:28.334
Hi, Mom.

01:32:28.459 --> 01:32:31.249
He gave me strength when I was weak.

01:32:49.668 --> 01:32:52.288
And then I became his.

01:32:52.418 --> 01:32:54.708
Ever since.

01:33:03.751 --> 01:33:07.041
And so you kill children?

01:33:07.168 --> 01:33:10.668
As a sacrifice to him?
Does he get their souls in Hell?

01:33:10.793 --> 01:33:13.333
This has nothing to do with children.

01:33:13.459 --> 01:33:17.419
I see why it may seem so,
but it doesn't.

01:33:17.543 --> 01:33:22.713
I've just found a way to serve
his final purpose. That's all.

01:33:22.834 --> 01:33:26.334
To defeat God,
I rob the devout of their faith.

01:33:26.459 --> 01:33:29.459
First I rob the children,
then the parents, the family.

01:33:29.584 --> 01:33:33.794
They all lose their faith
and it spreads, and now...

01:33:38.293 --> 01:33:40.423
And now...

01:33:43.418 --> 01:33:47.248
Now I will rob you of your faith, too.

01:33:54.834 --> 01:33:57.964
You're wasting your time.

01:33:58.084 --> 01:34:02.254
I don't believe in God.
I believe in jackshit.

01:34:18.043 --> 01:34:19.583
Johannes...

01:34:21.959 --> 01:34:23.619
Johannes.

01:34:25.834 --> 01:34:29.294
Johannes, listen to me.
No, no, Jo...!

01:34:30.584 --> 01:34:31.214
No!

01:34:32.501 --> 01:34:36.331
Listen to me.
Take me instead.

01:34:40.334 --> 01:34:44.044
Take me instead.
Take me instead. Samuel...

01:34:47.584 --> 01:34:52.504
All your life you've saved people
you never met. Of course you believe.

01:34:56.043 --> 01:34:57.173
Samuel...

01:34:57.293 --> 01:35:02.043
I've never met a believer like you
in all my life.

01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:06.959
Johannes, he's just a little boy.

01:35:07.084 --> 01:35:11.584
- He didn't do anything.
- Yes, he's just a little boy.

01:35:13.626 --> 01:35:17.506
- So why doesn't anyone help him?
- Take me instead, Johannes.

01:35:18.834 --> 01:35:20.174
Johannes!

01:35:24.209 --> 01:35:26.369
Samuel, look at me.
Samuel!

01:35:27.918 --> 01:35:31.168
No, no, no!
Johannes! Johannes!

01:35:35.584 --> 01:35:36.964
Johannes, take me!

01:35:37.084 --> 01:35:41.834
Don't you wish God would give you
the strength to stop me?

01:35:57.459 --> 01:36:00.789
Johannes, get him up.

01:36:00.918 --> 01:36:04.788
- I think you will remember this day.
- Get him up.

01:36:04.918 --> 01:36:07.118
Listen to me.

01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:10.499
That you were here...

01:36:13.626 --> 01:36:16.756
... and that it didn't change a thing.

01:36:20.543 --> 01:36:24.463
And God never came.

01:36:48.126 --> 01:36:52.216
Johannes, what...
Listen to me.

01:36:52.334 --> 01:36:55.214
Don't do this.
Take me instead.

01:36:55.334 --> 01:36:58.714
Take this -

01:36:58.834 --> 01:37:00.714
- and get your revenge.

01:37:02.876 --> 01:37:06.426
Then you'll be his,
and he'll set you free.

01:37:22.626 --> 01:37:24.426
Stab me.

01:37:27.418 --> 01:37:30.118
Stab me and you'll be free.

01:37:34.793 --> 01:37:37.083
You disappoint me.

01:37:46.668 --> 01:37:49.788
You have seen,
and now you have to live with this.

01:37:52.834 --> 01:37:54.754
<i>I see a house in the sea.</i>

01:37:57.793 --> 01:38:01.043
<i>Assad, go down there.
Find Carl and the children.</i>

01:38:01.168 --> 01:38:04.038
<i>We have to land ashore.</i>

01:38:16.459 --> 01:38:20.959
Magdalena.
Free my wrists.

01:38:21.084 --> 01:38:23.624
Find something over there.
Cut the plastic strips.

01:38:23.751 --> 01:38:27.371
Hurry. Come here.

01:38:53.876 --> 01:38:55.676
Samuel! Samuel!

01:38:57.543 --> 01:38:59.463
Hurry!

01:39:07.793 --> 01:39:10.423
Just put me down here.

01:39:22.668 --> 01:39:24.618
Come back.

01:39:32.668 --> 01:39:36.208
- Samuel! Samuel!
- Samuel.

01:39:37.043 --> 01:39:38.503
Samuel.

01:39:39.543 --> 01:39:43.043
- Carl!
- He's out there somewhere.

01:39:46.043 --> 01:39:48.833
- Are you okay?
- I'll stay here.

01:42:48.626 --> 01:42:52.086
You and all the rest
have to live on -

01:42:52.209 --> 01:42:56.209
- grateful for all you were given
through Poul.

01:42:56.334 --> 01:43:01.294
Albeit short, his life gave you
a precious thing.

01:43:01.418 --> 01:43:06.418
You will live on, Trygve,
confident that he is with God now.

01:43:06.543 --> 01:43:08.793
Just like we are with God.

01:43:08.918 --> 01:43:12.418
For God reaches beyond Death's limits -

01:43:12.543 --> 01:43:17.213
- creating a bond between
the living and the dead.

01:43:17.334 --> 01:43:22.504
And gives us hope
that life is stronger than death.

01:43:22.626 --> 01:43:25.966
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:43:26.918 --> 01:43:32.248
<i>Beauty around us</i>

01:43:32.376 --> 01:43:37.336
<i>glory above us.</i>

01:43:37.459 --> 01:43:41.209
<i>Lovely is earth</i>

01:43:41.334 --> 01:43:45.754
<i>and the smiling skies.</i>

01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:52.369
<i>Singing we pass along</i>

01:43:52.501 --> 01:43:57.081
<i>pilgrims upon our way</i>

01:43:57.209 --> 01:44:03.669
<i>through these fair lands
to Paradise.</i>

01:44:06.626 --> 01:44:11.756
<i>Ages are coming</i>

01:44:11.876 --> 01:44:17.046
<i>roll on and vanish.</i>

01:44:17.168 --> 01:44:21.788
<i>Children shall follow</i>

01:44:21.918 --> 01:44:25.618
<i>where fathers passed.</i>

01:44:27.418 --> 01:44:32.418
<i>Never our pilgrim song</i>

01:44:32.543 --> 01:44:37.253
<i>joyful and heaven born</i>

01:44:37.376 --> 01:44:44.046
<i>shall cease
while time and mountain last.</i>

01:44:46.959 --> 01:44:51.709
<i>First to the shepherds</i>

01:44:51.834 --> 01:44:57.424
<i>sweetly the angels</i>

01:44:57.543 --> 01:45:01.673
<i>sang it at midnight</i>

01:45:01.793 --> 01:45:05.713
<i>a song of morn:</i>

01:45:07.209 --> 01:45:11.329
<i>Glory to God on high.</i>

01:45:12.293 --> 01:45:16.963
<i>Peace and good will to men.</i>

01:45:17.084 --> 01:45:23.504
<i>Today is Christ, our saviour, born.</i>

01:45:38.626 --> 01:45:40.586
Let's go.

01:46:20.084 --> 01:46:21.674
Thanks.

01:46:40.084 --> 01:46:43.424
I've always looked
at those kids thinking...

01:46:43.543 --> 01:46:46.713
What silly fools.
