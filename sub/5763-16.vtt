WEBVTT

00:01.700 --> 00:02.870
The day of the accident,

00:02.870 --> 00:05.300
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body

00:06.810 --> 00:07.680
You're back.

00:07.990 --> 00:08.950
Do I know you?

00:09.010 --> 00:10.350
I see the same guy that you see...

00:10.740 --> 00:12.480
It's not Jim. I just know what I see

00:12.480 --> 00:13.720
when I look in those eyes.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.670
And Jim is in there somewhere.

00:15.670 --> 00:16.645
Wait. You're not gonna tell me

00:16.655 --> 00:18.380
you think I'm your husband reincarnated.

00:18.380 --> 00:20.500
You're the only one who can see me. Please,help.

00:20.950 --> 00:21.880
Was something there?

00:21.900 --> 00:23.990
I'm sorry again for being so distracted.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.810
Where is she always running off to?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.040
She wasn't in this morning.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.670
She wasn't here last night either.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.950
You know they found that girl?

00:34.950 --> 00:36.310
Yeah. It's great news.

00:36.610 --> 00:37.190
Where were you?

00:38.350 --> 00:39.960
The...The firehouse.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.790
Right. You told me that. I forgot.

00:43.770 --> 00:44.320
Later.

00:50.060 --> 00:51.275
If that's Sam, could you just tell him

00:51.275 --> 00:52.490
that I'm at the restaurant already?

00:52.870 --> 00:54.290
That I don't want him to cancel me again.

00:56.340 --> 00:57.520
It's a tele marketer.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.210
What is going on?

00:59.700 --> 01:02.020
Well, it's just he's been acting weird lately.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.290
- You know, like something's changed.  - Like what?

01:06.050 --> 01:08.015
I don't know. It's like he can't trust me,

01:08.015 --> 01:08.980
which who can't blame him.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.640
I'm always running around after ghost

01:10.640 --> 01:12.640
or harsh conversations with Eli.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.580
But you do know, it's all about ghosts.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.930
Melinda, you have to tell him about it.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.745
I mean at best he'll believe you.

01:20.745 --> 01:21.830
At worst he still think you're

01:22.510 --> 01:24.310
eccentric, like I did.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.800
What?

01:27.730 --> 01:30.560
Nothing. I just...I was gonna tell him at dinner tonight.

01:30.560 --> 01:31.500
But a part of me was hoping

01:31.500 --> 01:32.840
that you would really talk me out of it.

01:32.940 --> 01:35.180
Why? You tell people you see ghosts all the time.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.570
Yes. But it's not usually followed up with

01:37.570 --> 01:40.660
"Oh, by the way, you're my husband's soul in another man's body

01:40.660 --> 01:42.340
Could you... could you pass the salt?"

01:42.750 --> 01:44.610
Are you planning on telling him everything?

01:44.710 --> 01:46.900
First I'm gonna see how he deals with my gift, you know,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.260
Maybe steps.

01:49.200 --> 01:49.940
Good night.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.440
- You didn't eat much.  - Yeah. I guess I was not hungry.

01:55.870 --> 01:57.570
Well, I'm glad you've got some free time.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.050
Yeah, schedule's been crazy.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.900
Look, I wanted to spend time together, but...

02:03.967 --> 02:05.866
Never mind.

02:05.933 --> 02:09.067
Look, I think I know what's going on,

02:09.133 --> 02:11.200
And I just want to clear the air,

02:11.267 --> 02:13.300
Because I hate having secrets.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.933
Good. That would be great.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.133
I...

02:16.200 --> 02:19.334
What's wrong? It's like you've seen a ghost.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.033
Actually...

02:25.067 --> 02:27.000
What the hell?

02:27.067 --> 02:29.434
All right, so we got everything, right?

02:29.500 --> 02:32.701
So, um, how long do we have to stay at this hotel?

02:32.766 --> 02:34.100
Oh, probably just the night.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.334
If the events are as frequent as you say they are,

02:35.400 --> 02:36.500
I should know something by dawn.

02:36.567 --> 02:39.133
John, Devin, what's going on?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.000
Oh, hey, Melinda.

02:41.067 --> 02:42.866
We were just, um...

02:42.933 --> 02:44.833
Some weird stuff has been going on.

02:44.900 --> 02:47.334
Uh, noises, things moving.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.167
Then doors started opening... locked doors.

02:50.234 --> 02:52.067
Yeah, we're at the end of our rope.

02:52.133 --> 02:55.500
Yeah, see, I know  you probably think

02:55.567 --> 02:56.667
This sounds crazy,

02:56.733 --> 02:59.133
And that's no offense to you,

02:59.133 --> 03:01.133
But when the plumber and the electrician couldn't help us.

03:01.133 --> 03:03.100
We didn't know who else to call, but...

03:03.167 --> 03:04.467
Linus Van Horn,

03:04.534 --> 03:07.967
SpI...Supernatural, Paranormal Investigation.

03:08.967 --> 03:10.200
Oh, here's my card.

03:10.267 --> 03:13.067
What do you do, exactly?

03:13.133 --> 03:15.800
Uh, well, spectral beings emit energy,

03:15.866 --> 03:18.434
So I set up infrared still and video cameras,

03:18.500 --> 03:19.766
Ultra sensitive audio recorders,

03:19.833 --> 03:21.467
Thermal measuring...

03:23.500 --> 03:25.234
There are a lot of non-believers out there.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.367
I'm guessing you're among them?

03:26.434 --> 03:28.200
No, no, no. It's just...

03:28.267 --> 03:30.367
- Really?  - Absolutely.

03:30.434 --> 03:31.601
So if you ever need a ghost hunter...

03:31.667 --> 03:33.434
No, that's all right. I'm already

03:33.500 --> 03:37.033
In hock to my, uh, witch doctor, but thanks.

03:38.667 --> 03:41.567
Witch doctors.

03:41.634 --> 03:44.534
Ghost hunters? Are people really this stupid?

03:44.601 --> 03:47.100
The clients, or the ghost guy?

03:47.167 --> 03:48.283
What's the difference?

03:48.283 --> 03:49.400
I mean, this is nonsense. Ghosts?

03:49.467 --> 03:50.567
Look, what you were saying about

03:50.567 --> 03:51.667
clearing things up...

03:51.733 --> 03:54.733
You know what, I, um, I...ugh,

03:54.800 --> 03:57.434
I forgot to write a check to the website guys.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.500
I'm just gonna run back to the store.

03:58.567 --> 03:59.900
- I can go with you. - That's ok.

03:59.967 --> 04:01.967
'Cause I'm probably just gonna do some other things

04:02.033 --> 04:04.534
While I'm there, so I'll just... I'll see you later.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.434
All right.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.500
I was this close! You know, to coming clean.

04:09.567 --> 04:11.100
And then this guy had to show up.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.067
You know, how is Sam supposed to take me seriously

04:13.133 --> 04:14.467
When there's a hearse driving around town

04:14.534 --> 04:15.833
With a big, giant ghost on top?

04:15.900 --> 04:16.866
Well, what if there really is

04:16.866 --> 04:17.833
a ghost in your friend's abode?

04:17.899 --> 04:19.933
Well, then it needs to be handled respectfully

04:20.000 --> 04:21.434
And crossed over, you know?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.067
Not tormented and photographed by some guy

04:23.133 --> 04:25.200
Who has no idea what he's dealing with.

04:25.267 --> 04:27.400
Wait a minute. So these guys

04:27.467 --> 04:28.766
Actually really can detect ghosts?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.033
Yeah, some of them, but that's all, you know?

04:31.100 --> 04:32.400
They can capture recordings and sounds,

04:32.467 --> 04:33.900
But they can't communicate with spirits.

04:33.967 --> 04:35.300
So people end up spending

04:35.367 --> 04:37.133
All of this money just to confuse and anger ghosts,

04:37.200 --> 04:39.200
And make things worse.

04:39.267 --> 04:41.866
All right, our ability should be on a need to know basis.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.050
Otherwise, we run the risk of

04:43.050 --> 04:44.167
becoming a complete laughingstock.

04:44.234 --> 04:45.701
Trust me.

04:45.766 --> 04:47.267
Sounds like you speak from experience.

04:47.334 --> 04:48.917
Yeah. I was almost outed by

04:48.917 --> 04:50.500
that shame the devil website.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.601
So you come to me to do what, right?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.534
- No, for help. - Oh, boy.

04:54.601 --> 04:56.033
Please?

04:56.100 --> 04:57.733
Ok, will you just go over there

04:57.800 --> 05:00.000
And find out if there's a ghost, and cross him over?

05:00.067 --> 05:01.634
All right? And tell that guy

05:01.701 --> 05:03.033
To take his carnival act somewhere else,

05:03.100 --> 05:04.933
Because I really...

05:05.000 --> 05:06.766
I really need to tell Sam the truth

05:06.833 --> 05:09.033
With just a little shred of dignity.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.866
If you want to learn about ghosts,

05:12.933 --> 05:14.534
You need the right equipment.

05:14.601 --> 05:15.800
That's a K-2 meter.

05:15.866 --> 05:17.833
That measures magnetic fields.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.067
Theoretically, if used properly,

05:20.133 --> 05:22.100
You should be able to get ghosts to communicate with you,

05:22.167 --> 05:24.033
You know, like 2 blips for yes,

05:24.100 --> 05:25.267
One for no sort of thing.

05:25.334 --> 05:26.467
Sounds primitive.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.667
Have you communicated with any ghosts?

05:28.733 --> 05:31.200
Uh, well, no, not yet.

05:31.267 --> 05:32.967
But I have heard them,

05:33.033 --> 05:35.033
Through EVP.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.167
Electronic, um...

05:36.234 --> 05:38.234
Voice phenomena, yeah. And I've seen them, too.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.733
Well, the recorded images.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.167
Here, check these out.

05:46.967 --> 05:48.267
Look at that.

05:48.334 --> 05:50.866
I used to use a T.I.D.C.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.634
That's a thermal imaging digital camera.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.900
Detects, you know, long wavelength

05:55.967 --> 05:58.100
Infrared, you know, things are invisible to the human eye.

05:58.167 --> 06:02.467
But then I upgraded to the M.F.S.C.

06:03.601 --> 06:04.701
I'm not gonna touch that one.

06:04.766 --> 06:07.766
That's a multi-frequency sensitive camera.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.800
And ever since I got this baby right here,

06:09.866 --> 06:12.933
I've been detecting ghosts everywhere.

06:16.500 --> 06:18.334
They look like little specks of dust.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.300
Uh, yeah,

06:20.367 --> 06:22.500
But they were taken in total darkness

06:22.567 --> 06:25.100
Where there's no light to detect dust.

06:25.167 --> 06:27.400
I thought you said you were a believer.

06:27.467 --> 06:30.967
Oh, I do believe... with the skepticism of science.

06:31.033 --> 06:32.567
Wow, that's a really hot ghost.

06:32.634 --> 06:35.267
What? Oh, no. I'm sorry.

06:35.334 --> 06:38.067
That's, uh, that's my ex-girlfriend.

06:38.133 --> 06:40.900
And you got all this using your multi...

06:40.967 --> 06:43.133
Frequency sensitive camera, that's right.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.766
This baby right here.

06:44.833 --> 06:46.733
And not cheap.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.400
What do we do now?

06:48.467 --> 06:50.534
We turn off the lights and we wait.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:59.234 --> 07:02.100
No, no, hey!

07:02.167 --> 07:03.900
Wait, shh, shh! Hey, hey, hey!

07:03.967 --> 07:06.200
Look at this, come here!

07:06.267 --> 07:08.167
Oh! There is definitely a presence.

07:08.234 --> 07:09.800
Yeah, you can call it that.

07:09.866 --> 07:11.200
This is so weird. Usually when I pick up an E.V.P.,

07:11.267 --> 07:14.234
-Something comes up...   - Stairs! Go towards the stairs!

07:14.300 --> 07:15.967
What?

07:16.033 --> 07:17.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa, there it is!

07:19.000 --> 07:20.033
Wait, is that... Is that...

07:20.100 --> 07:21.800
It's that, really. Come on, come on.

07:25.067 --> 07:27.000
I just saw my first ghost.

07:27.067 --> 07:28.267
Yeah.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.300
How did you know where it was?

08:09.534 --> 08:11.267
Are you listening? I said I saw my first ghost!

08:12.834 --> 08:15.467
Wait, so this ghost guy is the real deal?

08:15.533 --> 08:16.867
Only in that he can take pictures.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.067
Nothing else is new.

08:18.134 --> 08:20.334
Oh, really, miss I see ghosts all the time?

08:20.400 --> 08:22.334
Can us newbies bask a little? Please.

08:24.867 --> 08:27.501
Ok, enough basking. Did you talk to the ghost?

08:27.567 --> 08:29.067
No.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.666
But I kind of let it slip that I could hear them,

08:31.733 --> 08:33.467
So Linus is extending his run.

08:33.534 --> 08:35.700
Ugh, Eli, you validated this guy?

08:35.765 --> 08:36.933
No!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.200
I merely heard the ghost he photographed,

08:39.267 --> 08:40.732
Which means he's legit.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.500
Besides, won't this help you prove to Sam

08:42.500 --> 08:43.500
that ghosts are real?

08:43.500 --> 08:46.067
Yeah, well, fuzzy orbs wouldn't have swayed me.

08:46.134 --> 08:48.033
Thank you. You know, Eli,

08:48.100 --> 08:49.467
You have to cross this ghost.

08:49.534 --> 08:50.501
And get rid of this guy.

08:50.567 --> 08:51.766
Just give me a little bit more time.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.867
- I don't have much more time. - I know.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.467
But when I tried to engage her in a little one-on-one,

08:55.534 --> 08:57.766
She realized she was being videoed, she bounced.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.434
Great, so she's hiding something.

08:59.501 --> 09:01.900
It'd be so much easier if you just came over there and just...

09:01.967 --> 09:03.234
I can't, ok?

09:03.301 --> 09:04.683
If I start hanging out at a house

09:04.683 --> 09:06.066
with a plastic ghost in front,

09:06.066 --> 09:07.467
Sam's gonna think I'm nuts.

09:07.534 --> 09:09.966
Ok, look, I did my research.

09:10.033 --> 09:11.901
Your friends bought that house in a probate sale

09:11.966 --> 09:13.901
From the estate of one Evelyn Bellsbury,

09:13.966 --> 09:15.901
Senior citizen who lived there from 1972

09:15.966 --> 09:17.500
Until she vanished a few years ago.

09:17.567 --> 09:18.834
The case was never solved.

09:18.901 --> 09:20.567
Well, then, solve it for god sake, ok?

09:20.634 --> 09:23.700
Just find out what's keeping this Mrs. Bellsbury here.

09:23.767 --> 09:26.767
Get her into the light so Melinda can tell Sam!

09:26.834 --> 09:30.000
I really, I just can't take much more of this!

09:30.066 --> 09:32.500
Ok! I'm on it.

09:49.133 --> 09:50.500
Come on.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.667
Let's see who you are.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.500
"Grandview antiques dealer Melinda Gordon

09:58.500 --> 10:01.834
Seems to be hiding a very mysterious sideline."

10:05.834 --> 10:08.200
Damn it.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.033
Trouble, no!

10:19.500 --> 10:21.534
Hey, sorry, but can't you read the sign?

10:21.600 --> 10:23.167
Uh, I'm actually

10:23.233 --> 10:24.700
Not selling anything.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.233
Um, I'm...you're Jeffrey Crockett, right?

10:27.300 --> 10:30.667
I'm Dr. Eli James. Um, I'm writing a paper

10:30.734 --> 10:33.267
On the plight of Grandview's elderly,

10:33.333 --> 10:34.834
And, uh, I was wondering if you knew anything

10:34.901 --> 10:37.133
About your neighbor, Evelyn Bellsbury.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.933
Uh, a little. We bought the house 10 years ago,

10:40.000 --> 10:41.333
Right before she disappeared.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.700
I was hoping to learn a little bit more about that.

10:43.767 --> 10:46.533
Well, yeah. She was, uh, a really sweet old lady.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.834
We called her Mrs. Blueberry

10:48.900 --> 10:51.700
Because she made the most amazing jellies and jams.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.700
Trouble! No!

10:55.101 --> 10:57.200
I didn't realize she was married.

10:57.266 --> 10:59.067
Well, she wasn't. It was just her

10:59.133 --> 11:01.333
And her parakeet as far as I know.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.934
Anyway, we were shocked when she went missing.

11:03.001 --> 11:04.700
Do you remember anything about that?

11:04.767 --> 11:07.934
Let's see, um, she brought over these scrumptious

11:08.001 --> 11:10.001
Blueberry tarts for the holidays.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.333
I mean, the filling was unbelievable.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.767
The pastry was like butter. It...Trouble!

11:16.834 --> 11:18.700
And then a couple weeks later,

11:18.767 --> 11:20.767
There were cop cars out in front of her house.

11:20.834 --> 11:22.533
So she just left?

11:22.600 --> 11:24.834
Well, nobody really knows. I mean, her car was there,

11:24.900 --> 11:26.867
Her keys were in her purse in her house

11:26.934 --> 11:28.600
With her license and her passport.

11:28.667 --> 11:31.934
There was still a bunch of blueberry tarts on the windowsill.

11:32.001 --> 11:34.133
Any chance that she could have just wandered off?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.800
I don't know how far she would have gotten.

11:35.867 --> 11:36.967
She walked with a cane.

11:38.266 --> 11:40.533
Listen, I gotta let the dog out, you gotta go.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.034
Give me a 5 second head start, ok?

11:49.233 --> 11:50.533
Sam, hey.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.800
Um, I'm sorry, but Melinda

11:52.867 --> 11:54.333
Just stepped out for a while.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.667
Um, do you have any idea

11:56.734 --> 11:58.233
Where she might be?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.467
Um, actually I don't, but you're welcome to stay,

12:00.533 --> 12:02.867
Or I can just tell her that you stopped by.

12:08.166 --> 12:11.233
She's pretty guarded, isn't she? Melinda?

12:11.300 --> 12:13.467
You know, where she goes all the time.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.166
What she's doing.

12:15.233 --> 12:17.934
Yeah, she's, um,

12:18.001 --> 12:19.734
Kind of a private person.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.166
Look, I don't want to seem like I'm checking up on her, ok,

12:22.233 --> 12:24.567
But I just can't shake the feeling

12:24.634 --> 12:27.101
That there is more going on in her life than...

12:27.166 --> 12:28.867
Selling antiques.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.700
She's, um...

12:30.767 --> 12:32.467
Complicated.

12:32.533 --> 12:33.533
I know.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.834
I get it, I do. And that's cool.

12:35.900 --> 12:37.633
She just lost her husband,

12:37.633 --> 12:39.367
And maybe I'm asking for too much, too soon.

12:39.433 --> 12:40.967
But if there is something going on with her,

12:41.034 --> 12:43.934
I just want her to know she can let me in.

12:44.001 --> 12:46.034
She will.

12:46.101 --> 12:47.867
I know she will.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.934
I hope so.

12:51.067 --> 12:56.101
Sam, Melinda has got this huge heart.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.233
And she's such a good person,

12:58.300 --> 13:00.067
And she helps a lot of people,

13:00.133 --> 13:04.467
And she just doesn't like to be in the limelight or take credit.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.400
Credit for what?

13:07.700 --> 13:10.200
You just gotta give her some time.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.067
And when she does talk to you,

13:14.133 --> 13:17.367
You gotta keep an open mind, ok?

13:17.433 --> 13:22.200
Like, wide open.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.734
Here you go.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.567
Coffee, and in honor of our ghost,

13:29.634 --> 13:31.967
Blueberry pastries. 'Cause I did a little research,

13:32.034 --> 13:33.067
And our ghost...

13:33.133 --> 13:34.867
Is most likely Evelyn Bellsbury,

13:34.934 --> 13:39.034
Who the neighbors affectionately refer to as Mrs. Blueberry.

13:39.101 --> 13:41.067
So you met Trouble.

13:41.133 --> 13:43.367
Yes, I met Trouble, and I brought him dog biscuits, too.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.300
I really do my homework.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.200
You know, if Mrs. Bellsbury

13:47.266 --> 13:48.600
Tells us what happened to her,

13:48.667 --> 13:50.934
She could be... she could be the one.

13:51.001 --> 13:52.133
The one?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.034
Yeah, I mean, people may think

13:54.101 --> 13:55.367
That folks like you and I are crazy,

13:55.433 --> 13:58.034
But if we can actually prove that a ghost helped us solve

13:58.101 --> 13:59.934
A missing person's case...

14:00.001 --> 14:02.734
Oh, she's here!

14:03.600 --> 14:05.500
Hit the lights.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.734
Come here.

14:11.767 --> 14:13.367
Holy cow.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.567
Talk to her.

14:15.634 --> 14:16.867
Talk to her!

14:16.934 --> 14:18.300
Evelyn?

14:18.367 --> 14:20.800
Can you tell me what happened to you?

14:20.867 --> 14:23.433
Whoa, she's on the move. Here.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.867
Put these on.

14:49.567 --> 14:51.300
She's moving kind of slow because...

14:51.367 --> 14:52.533
She walked with a cane.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.067
Yeah.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.934
Oh, look!

14:56.001 --> 14:57.533
There it is.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.300
Oh, my god.

15:01.367 --> 15:02.900
It really is her.

15:04.266 --> 15:06.034
This is awesome!

15:06.101 --> 15:08.333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:08.400 --> 15:11.001
That's the door the occupant said kept opening.

15:11.067 --> 15:13.500
Even when it was locked.

15:23.934 --> 15:26.233
I got goosebumps. Do you have goosebumps?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.834
Mrs. Bellsbury?!

15:38.934 --> 15:40.400
She's gone.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.800
Sorry, sorry, sorry. My bad.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.834
Cake mix?

15:58.867 --> 16:01.333
Cake mix?

16:01.400 --> 16:03.600
It's empty.

16:03.667 --> 16:06.500
Hey, look, there's a false bottom to this.

16:12.567 --> 16:14.767
13 cents.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.467
It's an old savings passbook.

16:16.533 --> 16:19.266
Look at this... right before she disappeared,

16:19.333 --> 16:21.867
She withdrew everything she had in cash.

16:21.934 --> 16:23.333
Do you think she hoarded all of her money

16:23.400 --> 16:24.967
In these cake boxes?

16:25.034 --> 16:26.700
Yes, I do.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.634
But where's the money now?

16:29.700 --> 16:32.467
Little old lady, living alone.

16:32.533 --> 16:33.900
Withdraws all of her savings, and then...

16:33.967 --> 16:35.300
Wait, wait, you think somebody knew

16:35.367 --> 16:36.467
That all of her money was here?

16:36.533 --> 16:39.034
Could have been anyone. Housekeeper or someone

16:39.101 --> 16:40.433
Who followed her home from the bank.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.467
- 'Cause the next thing...  - She disappears.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.900
She leaves a fresh batch

16:44.967 --> 16:46.800
Of blueberry tarts just sitting on the window sill,

16:46.867 --> 16:48.166
Cooling.

16:48.233 --> 16:49.667
What a waste.

16:49.734 --> 16:52.267
I think she might have been murdered.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.101
Murder!

16:59.166 --> 17:00.867
We're talking murder!

17:00.934 --> 17:02.100
Poor little Mrs. Blueberry,

17:02.167 --> 17:03.767
She put all her money into dry goods,

17:03.783 --> 17:04.617
And they whacked her!

17:04.633 --> 17:05.867
All right, keep your voice down!

17:05.894 --> 17:07.194
God, what are you, in the mob?

17:07.260 --> 17:09.027
Wait until you see the footage.

17:10.893 --> 17:12.560
Did he upload this to his website already?

17:12.626 --> 17:14.060
Yeah, guy's gotta make a living.

17:14.127 --> 17:15.660
And if Linus cracks a murder,

17:15.727 --> 17:17.560
He's on his way to some serious ghost coin.

17:17.626 --> 17:19.526
I thought you said this was a passion for him.

17:19.593 --> 17:21.593
It is! And after seeing my first spirit,

17:21.660 --> 17:23.394
I'm thinking about quitting my day job, too.

17:23.461 --> 17:25.327
You were that inspired

17:25.394 --> 17:27.993
By some shifting, grainy blob?

17:28.060 --> 17:29.860
Don't call Mrs. Blueberry a blob.

17:29.927 --> 17:32.593
She's a nice, murdered little old lady.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.394
- How do you know?  - She baked treats.

17:34.461 --> 17:37.227
How do you know that she was murdered?

17:37.294 --> 17:40.560
Ok, so, fine, she led you to some stored money...

17:40.626 --> 17:42.027
Uh, all of her money,

17:42.094 --> 17:43.994
Withdrawn days before she disappeared.

17:44.060 --> 17:46.927
One day it's gone, and so is she.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.572
What, you think she went to Paris

17:48.572 --> 17:49.994
and left her tarts on the windowsill?

17:50.060 --> 17:52.094
I don't know. The woman was 76 years old.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.394
Maybe she forgot about them.

17:54.461 --> 17:56.893
Oh! I forgot about them!

17:56.960 --> 17:59.361
Why can't this be murder?!

18:02.626 --> 18:04.827
Are you jealous because I'm playing with Linus and not you?

18:04.893 --> 18:06.827
Look, if she was killed by somebody,

18:06.893 --> 18:09.127
Why wouldn't she just tell you that? Sam! Hey.

18:09.194 --> 18:10.593
Eli!

18:10.660 --> 18:12.893
- Melinda.  - Eli.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.827
Sam.

18:15.893 --> 18:18.693
Yeah, I just, uh, I thought I'd come by.

18:18.760 --> 18:19.860
I saw you were home and

18:19.927 --> 18:21.927
What is that?

18:21.994 --> 18:23.194
Uh, that's...

18:23.260 --> 18:24.260
That's the guy.

18:24.327 --> 18:26.461
That's the ghost guy, right?

18:26.526 --> 18:29.027
Yeah, uh, Eli was just showing it to me.

18:29.094 --> 18:30.693
Yeah, uh, I was talking to him.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.893
I like people who are different and stuff.

18:33.960 --> 18:35.526
Wait a minute, what's that?

18:35.593 --> 18:36.526
Supposed to be some kind of ghost?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.693
I think so, yeah.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.927
Yeah. How did he do that?

18:39.994 --> 18:42.194
What makes you think he did anything?

18:42.260 --> 18:45.094
What, you guys don't believe in this stuff, do you?

18:45.160 --> 18:47.893
Well, I mean, he recorded sounds

18:47.960 --> 18:49.893
And some energy moving around.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.461
Yeah, well, it's easy enough to doctor footage, isn't it?

18:52.526 --> 18:53.893
Well, yeah, I guess so, but the neighbors

18:53.893 --> 18:55.260
did say that they heard voices,

18:55.327 --> 18:56.793
You know, when nobody else was home.

18:56.860 --> 18:59.060
Right, hearing noises, like bumps in the night.

18:59.127 --> 19:00.827
It's basically air and plumbing.

19:00.893 --> 19:02.693
And energy moving around, isn't that just when

19:02.760 --> 19:04.060
We forget where we put our keys?

19:04.127 --> 19:05.927
Well, what makes you so sure?

19:05.994 --> 19:08.327
You know, I barely know who I am right now,

19:08.394 --> 19:10.460
So I'm not sure about much, but the one thing I am sure of

19:10.527 --> 19:12.527
Is that ghosts aren't real,

19:12.594 --> 19:15.794
And I'm very sure that guys like this who say they are

19:15.861 --> 19:17.993
Are just preying on other people's fears.

19:18.060 --> 19:20.960
What's up with Sam's negativ-o attitude

19:21.026 --> 19:22.694
About all things paranormal?

19:22.761 --> 19:24.727
You'd think a ghost ate his dog or something.

19:24.994 --> 19:30.293
Yeah, it's weird. I mean, Jim was never like that, not at all.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.794
When you told him, he just jumped right in a believer?

19:33.961 --> 19:36.027
All I know is, he...

19:36.093 --> 19:37.727
He believed in me,

19:37.794 --> 19:41.027
And somehow it's harder for him to do that.

19:41.093 --> 19:42.327
Oh, wait, ok! Listen, I really get the sense...

19:42.393 --> 19:44.027
And this knucklehead,

19:44.093 --> 19:46.160
He's not making it any easier.

19:46.226 --> 19:47.293
What can you do?

19:47.360 --> 19:49.093
Nothing! It's probably fine.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.427
Look, you said a woman was murdered

19:50.427 --> 19:51.694
in our house and she's still there.

19:51.760 --> 19:52.894
How was that fine?

19:52.961 --> 19:55.360
It's, uh...oh, hi.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.894
Hey, I was just coming by to see how everything's going.

19:58.961 --> 20:00.860
Honestly? Terrible.

20:00.927 --> 20:03.894
Guess what? We bought a haunted house.

20:03.961 --> 20:05.627
- Honey, I... - You saw the proof!

20:05.694 --> 20:08.027
You guys are talking about the previous owner, right?

20:08.093 --> 20:09.961
Mrs. Bellsbury? Did you ever meet her?

20:10.027 --> 20:12.126
- No. Did you? - No.

20:12.193 --> 20:14.560
Did you actually... did you actually see her?

20:14.627 --> 20:17.794
I mean, how did she make her presence known?

20:17.860 --> 20:19.927
Well, we started hearing clanging

20:19.994 --> 20:21.560
And banging in the night.

20:21.627 --> 20:23.727
And the jars would rattle in the basement.

20:23.794 --> 20:24.561
The jars?

20:24.626 --> 20:26.394
You know, the sealed glass jars

20:26.461 --> 20:27.793
People buy for canning.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.127
She left hundreds of them.

20:29.194 --> 20:32.227
Uh, look, we, uh, we have to re-register at the hotel

20:32.294 --> 20:33.461
If we're going to stay another night.

20:33.527 --> 20:35.427
It's good seeing you, Melinda.

20:35.494 --> 20:37.527
And you, you call us if there's any resolution.

20:37.593 --> 20:40.227
And I truly believe that spirits

20:40.294 --> 20:42.561
Do not mean us any harm, you know,

20:42.626 --> 20:45.027
They just want to be heard and understood!

20:49.726 --> 20:52.260
You didn't tell me about jars.

20:52.327 --> 20:55.194
I didn't know about them, I still don't.

20:55.260 --> 20:57.693
Ok, well, you said that she was hiding her money in the pantry.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.027
Then it's gone, what else is missing?

21:00.094 --> 21:02.827
Um, her body?

21:04.294 --> 21:06.427
The fruits of her labor.

21:06.494 --> 21:09.827
Ok. All right, she was stocking up.

21:09.893 --> 21:12.360
What year did she go missing, exactly?

21:12.427 --> 21:14.561
Uh, I guess it was 1999.

21:14.626 --> 21:16.027
So the last time that the neighbors saw her,

21:16.094 --> 21:17.494
It was Christmas.

21:17.561 --> 21:20.793
But what if...what if she wasn't saving up for Christmas?

21:21.260 --> 21:23.427
Wh what if it was for New Year's?

21:32.160 --> 21:33.500
Mrs. Bellsbury?

21:40.260 --> 21:41.794
It is you.

21:41.894 --> 21:45.126
Can you please tell me what happened.

21:45.193 --> 21:47.327
Oh, no. No.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.527
No, no. Noy, wait, wait, come back!

21:58.694 --> 21:59.827
She's here!

21:59.894 --> 22:03.927
Um, she's, um,  she's here!  she's here!

22:05.260 --> 22:07.060
He's a psycho.

22:27.026 --> 22:28.460
What is that?

22:28.527 --> 22:30.227
Do you hear that?

22:30.293 --> 22:33.193
I don't hear ghosts. You do.

22:33.260 --> 22:34.794
Oh, right.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.000
Right.

22:39.993 --> 22:41.861
Come on.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.360
Why is she making that noise?

22:57.060 --> 22:58.727
No!

23:00.627 --> 23:02.660
Wait a minute. What happened?

23:15.594 --> 23:18.293
Are you seeing this?!

23:18.360 --> 23:20.993
It's Mrs. Bellsbury!

23:21.060 --> 23:22.927
I know that dress. I saw it in a photo.

23:22.993 --> 23:24.160
Holy cow!

23:24.227 --> 23:26.093
Hello, are you seeing this?!

23:26.160 --> 23:28.560
I see it!

23:28.627 --> 23:30.494
- I saw it. - And?

23:30.761 --> 23:33.160
Right body, wrong ghost.

23:42.727 --> 23:44.460
The pressure latch jammed.

23:44.467 --> 23:45.800
She got locked in.

23:45.867 --> 23:47.533
Wasn't a robbery, either. The police said they found

23:47.600 --> 23:49.000
her life savings down there.

23:49.067 --> 23:51.867
Minus the 13 cents we found in that cake box.

23:51.934 --> 23:53.034
So much for robbery murder.

23:53.101 --> 23:55.067
Yeah. I'm glad about that.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.934
Look, I'm gonna try and grab some more gear,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.366
see if I can get in there.

23:58.433 --> 24:00.500
The police might need my help, you know?

24:00.567 --> 24:02.567
There's still a story to be told here.

24:02.633 --> 24:06.067
And thanks to this puppy, I'm the man to tell it.

24:07.601 --> 24:10.200
I think Mrs. Bellsbury's been at peace

24:10.267 --> 24:11.800
For a long, long time now.

24:11.866 --> 24:14.566
Are you sure you didn't see her spirit?

24:14.633 --> 24:16.167
Not unless she was trans-gendered

24:16.234 --> 24:17.767
or cut twenty years off her age.

24:17.833 --> 24:19.167
What was she doing down there?

24:19.234 --> 24:21.500
I think she was preparing for the millennium.

24:21.566 --> 24:23.401
I mean, the jars, the preserves,

24:23.500 --> 24:25.600
the money that she was hiding in her secret room.

24:25.667 --> 24:27.366
A panic room.

24:27.367 --> 24:29.367
She was making a panic room because 1999

24:29.433 --> 24:30.500
was coming to a close.

24:30.567 --> 24:31.834
Yeah, the whole world was freaking out.

24:31.900 --> 24:34.266
You know, January first, 2000.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.200
The computers were supposed to fail;

24:36.266 --> 24:37.800
Banking systems collapse.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.034
Life as we know it would cease.

24:39.101 --> 24:41.500
She was a y2k nut.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.133
But who's the ghost that led us to her?

24:43.200 --> 24:44.800
I have no idea.

24:44.867 --> 24:46.233
Neither does Linus.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.001
And Mrs. Blueberry sure ain't talking.

24:48.067 --> 24:49.433
Wait a minute.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.834
Linus.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.900
What if we're right?

24:52.967 --> 24:54.600
What if the ghost isn't someone in her life

24:54.667 --> 24:57.400
or the new owners? Who else does that leave?

24:58.667 --> 25:00.900
Linus?

25:00.967 --> 25:02.034
But I only said that 'cause you said it already.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.034
Ever since he got his fancy equipment,

25:04.101 --> 25:06.834
His very accurate fancy equipment,

25:06.900 --> 25:08.967
He's been able to see ghosts everywhere.

25:09.034 --> 25:11.000
I haven't seen ghosts everywhere.

25:11.000 --> 25:11.967
Have you heard any?

25:12.034 --> 25:13.400
I just assumed he was exaggerating.

25:13.767 --> 25:15.700
What if he wasn't?

25:15.767 --> 25:18.900
What if the reason he's the only one who's finding ghosts

25:18.967 --> 25:23.067
is because he's the one who's haunted?

25:23.134 --> 25:24.700
Anyway, as you can see, there's a lot of activity here.

25:24.767 --> 25:27.200
It's unbelievable!

25:27.267 --> 25:29.100
I've gotten 3 calls from reporters,

25:29.167 --> 25:30.633
2 new clients, and my website

25:30.700 --> 25:32.334
is getting slammed with hits.

25:32.401 --> 25:34.134
Congrats.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.800
You're the one that figured out

25:35.867 --> 25:37.600
that Mrs. B was canning for catastrophe.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.401
You should be sharing some of the credit.

25:39.466 --> 25:41.367
I appreciate that, but I prefer

25:41.433 --> 25:42.967
to keep what I do private.

25:43.034 --> 25:45.134
Why? It's so cool.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.067
Eli, you could change the way that people think

25:47.134 --> 25:49.600
About the dead, about the unknown,

25:49.667 --> 25:51.067
About everything.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.600
Yeah, well, it might change the way people think about me.

25:53.667 --> 25:55.234
You can't...

25:55.301 --> 25:57.800
You can't be worried about that.

25:57.867 --> 25:59.700
I...I...yes, I know,

25:59.767 --> 26:01.900
I paid the price for believing,

26:01.967 --> 26:04.800
But it doesn't matter, 'cause it's important to me.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.301
Why?

26:06.367 --> 26:08.000
I mean, one day I heard ghosts,

26:08.067 --> 26:10.267
I needed an explanation.

26:10.334 --> 26:13.034
But you, you took a leap of faith long before you had proof.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.900
Oh, I had proof.

26:14.967 --> 26:17.234
Believe me.

26:21.767 --> 26:24.500
I grew up in a bad part of the city.

26:24.566 --> 26:26.367
And when we were 9,

26:26.433 --> 26:28.600
My friend, he got shot.

26:28.667 --> 26:31.367
Just crossing the street.

26:31.433 --> 26:33.267
It was pretty hard to feel safe after that,

26:33.334 --> 26:35.700
But...I did.

26:35.767 --> 26:37.134
Why?

26:37.200 --> 26:40.767
My grandmother told me that he was with me.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.067
Your friend who died?

26:43.134 --> 26:45.200
Did your grandmother have the gift?

26:45.267 --> 26:48.301
Well, she can't see or hear ghosts,

26:48.367 --> 26:51.267
But she believes in guardian angels.

26:51.334 --> 26:52.967
And she said that I have one with me now.

26:53.034 --> 26:54.900
And she must have been right,

26:54.967 --> 26:57.401
Because how else would I have gotten out of there?

26:57.466 --> 26:59.700
Gone to college, graduate school.

26:59.767 --> 27:03.367
All along the way, being guided to people who would help me.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.334
Well, like Carrie.

27:06.767 --> 27:09.067
Carrie?

27:09.134 --> 27:11.566
Who's Carrie? Is that someone who died?

27:11.633 --> 27:13.667
No. No, no, no. It's my ex-girlfriend.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.100
You saw her picture.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.301
Yeah. Even after she broke up with me,

27:17.367 --> 27:18.583
She loaned me the money to buy that

27:18.583 --> 27:19.800
multi-frequency sensitive camera.

27:19.867 --> 27:21.900
I mean, is that nice or what?

27:21.967 --> 27:23.100
Um, mixed.

27:23.167 --> 27:25.034
But I'm interested in this guardian angel.

27:25.100 --> 27:27.200
Is he still with you?

27:27.267 --> 27:28.800
Sure, yeah, I guess.

27:28.867 --> 27:30.466
Do you think it's someone other than your friend

27:30.533 --> 27:31.867
who died as a child?

27:31.934 --> 27:35.000
Say a man, mid-fifties, you may have known?

27:35.067 --> 27:37.234
That's pretty specific, Eli.

27:37.301 --> 27:40.566
Do you know anyone who died who matches that description?

27:40.633 --> 27:43.000
No, no, not a soul.

27:44.267 --> 27:46.234
Why? Do you hear somebody around me?

27:46.301 --> 27:47.621
Because I'm pretty sure that Carrie

27:47.621 --> 27:49.167
would have captured something like that.

27:49.234 --> 27:50.466
Carrie, your girlfriend?

27:50.533 --> 27:53.967
No, no, no, no. I named my MFS camera in her honor.

27:54.034 --> 27:55.500
Ok.

27:55.566 --> 27:58.767
When you said Carrie picks up ghost images,

27:58.833 --> 28:01.301
Basically everywhere you go since you got it...her,

28:01.367 --> 28:03.167
There's a spirit around you.

28:03.234 --> 28:04.633
Spirits are everywhere.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.900
I mean, I just didn't see them until I got Carrie.

28:06.967 --> 28:09.034
When was that, exactly?

28:09.100 --> 28:11.000
He doesn't know anyone who fits that description?

28:11.067 --> 28:12.633
He didn't seem to, but I do know

28:12.633 --> 28:14.200
when he started clocking spirit stuff.

28:14.267 --> 28:16.566
Spirits, or this particular spirit?

28:16.633 --> 28:18.466
That's for you to figure out. I got papers to grade.

28:18.533 --> 28:20.466
But it all started when his girlfriend Carrie gave him the boot

28:20.533 --> 28:22.583
And a nice loan for his fancy camera...

28:22.583 --> 28:24.633
A rather large loan.

28:26.167 --> 28:27.533
Eli, I'm not a jealous guy.

28:27.600 --> 28:28.800
I mean, she and I haven't been dating long enough

28:28.867 --> 28:30.234
For me to even be jealous.

28:30.301 --> 28:31.566
But, look, I have to say,

28:31.633 --> 28:33.367
I do notice you coming in and out of Melinda's

28:33.433 --> 28:34.900
At all hours, I do.

28:34.967 --> 28:36.500
- We're friends.  - I know that,

28:36.566 --> 28:38.067
And that's not what I'm after here.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.401
I don't think for a minute that you guys are involved.

28:40.466 --> 28:41.566
Not for a minute?

28:41.633 --> 28:44.900
I mean, we're not, but...a minute?

28:44.967 --> 28:46.334
Eli...

28:46.401 --> 28:48.200
I'm here about the bodies.

28:48.267 --> 28:49.566
Excuse me?

28:49.633 --> 28:51.566
The dead people that tend to surface.

28:51.633 --> 28:53.500
Every time Melinda becomes interested in something.

28:53.566 --> 28:55.401
There was...there was the little girl

28:55.466 --> 28:56.566
At the bottom of the well

28:56.633 --> 28:58.067
She was suddenly fascinated by.

28:58.134 --> 29:00.667
There was the sorority girl lost in the woods.

29:00.733 --> 29:02.334
She wasn't dead.

29:02.401 --> 29:03.901
Nearly dead.

29:03.901 --> 29:05.401
And then there's the old lady that they just found.

29:05.466 --> 29:08.934
Look, Eli, tell me, I know you worked on this case.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.167
Case? What are you talking about? I'm a professor.

29:11.234 --> 29:12.833
Yeah, but you're also a clinical psychologist.

29:12.900 --> 29:14.334
Who consults with the police.

29:14.401 --> 29:16.633
What makes you think that?

29:16.700 --> 29:18.700
Because you told me one night, over drinks.

29:18.767 --> 29:20.167
I gotta quit drinking.

29:20.234 --> 29:21.466
You had one beer.

29:21.533 --> 29:23.700
That's pathetic. I gotta quit bragging.

29:23.767 --> 29:26.034
Look, I talked to Delia and she said, look,

29:26.100 --> 29:27.833
Cut Melinda some slack, ok, because she does so much

29:27.900 --> 29:29.401
For the community,

29:29.466 --> 29:30.934
You know. She helps people.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.934
Now you tell me, how does an antiques dealer do that?

29:34.000 --> 29:35.433
Well, you can do stuff.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.034
Ah, you can't tell me. All right, I'll say it...

29:38.100 --> 29:40.800
She's a profiler, isn't she?

29:43.234 --> 29:46.466
Well, if she was, and I'm not saying she is,

29:46.533 --> 29:48.700
Don't you think it should be her place to tell you?

29:48.767 --> 29:50.401
She lies to me.

29:50.466 --> 29:52.566
And I just want to know why.

29:52.633 --> 29:54.900
And if she's not working with the law,

29:54.967 --> 29:57.034
Then what the hell is she doing?

29:58.367 --> 29:59.833
Please.

30:03.433 --> 30:06.533
Ok, look.

30:06.600 --> 30:10.234
Her official title is criminologist, ok?

30:10.301 --> 30:12.934
But she operates completely and totally under the radar.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.700
The FED insist on that.

30:19.633 --> 30:23.833
So Linus sent you to me for a reference?

30:23.900 --> 30:26.500
Well, how did you know you were haunted?

30:26.566 --> 30:30.533
I've, um... I've sensed things around me,

30:30.600 --> 30:34.401
I'm guessing that you believe in what Linus does.

30:34.466 --> 30:37.200
What's important is that he believes.

30:37.267 --> 30:40.401
He's not in it for the money.

30:40.466 --> 30:41.934
When I was with him,

30:42.000 --> 30:44.867
I had to push him to even bill for his time.

30:44.934 --> 30:46.700
Do you...

30:46.767 --> 30:49.301
Do you feed the birds like that every night?

30:49.367 --> 30:51.533
No.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.234
It's a baby raccoon.

30:54.301 --> 30:56.566
I think its mother abandoned it.

30:57.900 --> 31:00.900
I guess I'm just the patron saint of lost causes...

31:00.967 --> 31:02.100
Like Linus.

31:02.167 --> 31:05.034
I'm guessing that he wasn't having much luck

31:05.100 --> 31:06.466
When you with him.

31:06.533 --> 31:09.034
- Finding ghosts, I mean.  - No.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.800
Not too many.

31:10.867 --> 31:13.334
But did you see him on the news last night?

31:13.401 --> 31:17.301
He found this woman who had been missing for years.

31:18.466 --> 31:21.433
If only some people could see him now.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.800
Who are we talking about?

31:23.867 --> 31:26.900
My father.

31:26.967 --> 31:29.234
He, uh, he died.

31:29.301 --> 31:31.267
I'm sorry.

31:31.334 --> 31:33.767
He was always so hard on Linus.

31:33.833 --> 31:36.034
You know, he thought he was

31:36.100 --> 31:38.833
Such a loser and a kook,

31:38.900 --> 31:41.167
A pile of wasted potential.

31:41.234 --> 31:44.401
Not someone to build a future with.

31:44.466 --> 31:45.833
And when the rent checks kept bouncing

31:45.900 --> 31:47.934
And a fun date

31:48.000 --> 31:51.301
Meant going to the impound to get the boot off our car...

31:52.334 --> 31:54.401
I caved.

31:54.466 --> 31:56.433
And I dumped him.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.433
But you missed him.

31:59.767 --> 32:01.566
A lot.

32:01.633 --> 32:05.566
Enough to buy some new equipment for him?

32:05.633 --> 32:09.034
Well, after my father died, I didn't see the harm.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.134
Do you...do you have a picture of him?

32:11.200 --> 32:12.833
Your father?

32:12.900 --> 32:15.667
Yeah, why?

32:15.733 --> 32:17.334
I think I can tell you in a minute.

32:17.401 --> 32:19.367
If I could just see a picture.

32:19.433 --> 32:22.600
Ok, I have some on my phone.

32:26.301 --> 32:28.566
He would roll over in his grave

32:28.633 --> 32:30.566
If he knew what I did with his money.

32:30.633 --> 32:33.466
Yeah, I think he's done much more than that.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.733
New clients.

32:40.800 --> 32:43.334
Well, I guess the Linus show is extended once again.

32:43.401 --> 32:45.566
But what people don't realize is the ghost he's looking for

32:45.633 --> 32:48.134
Is his ex-girlfriend's father. What is wrong with you?

32:48.200 --> 32:50.267
You'd think as a shrink I'd know what to do with my anger,

32:50.334 --> 32:52.100
But look at me, my body is vibrating.

32:52.167 --> 32:54.334
You're really that mad? I mean, he's a ghost.

32:54.401 --> 32:55.566
They lie to us all the time.

32:55.633 --> 32:56.733
No, this is different.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.967
Linus can't detect ghosts like us,

32:59.034 --> 33:00.633
Ok, but that never shook his faith.

33:00.700 --> 33:03.167
He doesn't deserve to be deliberately mocked this way.

33:03.234 --> 33:05.600
- Wow, you really care about him.  - Yeah, I do.

33:05.666 --> 33:07.100
He's kind of like my potential.

33:07.167 --> 33:08.134
He kinda looks up to me.

33:08.200 --> 33:09.800
Aw, that's cute.

33:09.867 --> 33:11.533
It's not cute, it's serious.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.967
I hope this ghost creep stays earth-bound forever.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.034
I'm just glad the old man screwed up so bad

33:16.100 --> 33:18.434
He made Linus look like an actual genius.

33:18.501 --> 33:20.200
You just said that the ghost actually

33:20.267 --> 33:22.334
Made Linus look like a genius.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.633
Yeah, his plan backfired, precisely.

33:24.700 --> 33:26.000
What if that was his plan?

33:26.667 --> 33:28.300
Ok? What if...

33:28.367 --> 33:30.500
What if that ghost is actually trying to help him?

33:30.567 --> 33:31.901
Oh, great.

33:31.967 --> 33:33.601
So now all of a sudden, the ghost is a good guy?

33:33.667 --> 33:35.566
What would be wrong with that?

33:35.567 --> 33:36.601
What am I supposed to do with my anger now?

33:36.967 --> 33:38.535
Walk it off.

33:38.801 --> 33:40.267
All right? We have to go talk to Linus.

33:40.334 --> 33:41.634
Go.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.568
Walk.

33:44.635 --> 33:47.067
With a full night to observe, maybe two,

33:47.134 --> 33:49.834
I can confirm whether or not your manifestations

33:49.901 --> 33:52.234
Indicate a spectral infestation.

33:52.301 --> 33:54.601
So this is for real?

33:54.667 --> 33:57.301
Those machines can prove we have actual ghosts?

33:59.101 --> 34:01.067
Didn't you talk to Devin and John?

34:01.134 --> 34:03.268
Well, what happens after?

34:03.334 --> 34:04.601
How do you get rid of them?

34:04.667 --> 34:09.368
Uh, well, I mean, there's a whole process.

34:10.368 --> 34:12.434
Um, but detection is the first step

34:12.501 --> 34:14.034
To elimination.

34:14.101 --> 34:16.201
Could you excuse us for a minute?

34:16.268 --> 34:18.467
Yeah, of course.

34:26.501 --> 34:29.501
So I guess word of mouth is good for business.

34:30.934 --> 34:33.168
You know, it's like ever since that Mrs. Bellsbury thing,

34:33.234 --> 34:35.101
It's like everybody who has air in their plumbing

34:35.168 --> 34:36.501
Has a ghost.

34:36.568 --> 34:39.067
It's not that I'm saying that they don't.

34:39.134 --> 34:41.934
It's just I feel kind of bad taking advantage, you know?

34:42.001 --> 34:44.434
So is that how John and Devon found you?

34:44.501 --> 34:45.867
Is you helped somebody they knew?

34:45.934 --> 34:48.766
Actually, there's a funny story to that.

34:48.833 --> 34:52.201
Both John and Devon each said that they found their browser

34:52.268 --> 34:54.134
Open to my website.

34:54.201 --> 34:55.967
And they thought that the other one left it for them.

34:56.034 --> 34:58.284
I've seen evidence of ghosts

34:58.284 --> 35:00.535
interacting with electronics before,

35:00.601 --> 35:03.501
But... It's almost like Mrs. Bellsbury

35:03.568 --> 35:04.800
Wanted me to find her, you know?

35:04.867 --> 35:06.967
Yeah, it's a lot like that.

35:14.501 --> 35:16.501
Ok.

35:16.568 --> 35:20.134
Ok, you may be right.

35:20.201 --> 35:21.601
The ghost may not be evil.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.700
Yeah, which means he's been leading you this whole time...

35:23.767 --> 35:27.001
To the money stash, the basement room,

35:27.067 --> 35:28.067
Everything.

35:28.134 --> 35:29.334
But we did some pretty good detective work.

35:29.401 --> 35:30.934
I mean...

35:31.001 --> 35:32.967
And the ghost had us look where he wanted.

35:33.234 --> 35:36.000
Look, I wasn't suggesting that you're not a good profiler.

35:36.067 --> 35:37.534
You, either.

35:37.601 --> 35:38.701
The best.

35:38.768 --> 35:41.168
Yeah, except I'm not a profiler.

35:43.001 --> 35:44.534
What?

35:44.701 --> 35:47.334
Sam stopped by earlier.

35:47.401 --> 35:49.134
Had some questions.

35:49.201 --> 35:51.234
Eli!

35:51.301 --> 35:54.034
And I was a vault on the whole ghost thing.

35:54.100 --> 35:56.668
I didn't say anything, not a word, not even a syllable.

35:56.734 --> 35:57.868
The whole ghost thing?

35:57.935 --> 35:59.835
Yeah. Sometimes you have to

35:59.901 --> 36:02.034
use a smaller lie to cover the larger one.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.868
What did you tell him?

36:04.935 --> 36:08.067
He may have gotten the impression

36:08.134 --> 36:11.367
That you sometimes work for the government.

36:11.434 --> 36:12.901
- The government?!  - FBI, really.

36:12.968 --> 36:14.001
FBI?!

36:14.068 --> 36:16.801
As a profiler, but it sounds pretty sexy, right?

36:30.901 --> 36:32.734
Oh, my god. Are you ok?

36:32.801 --> 36:33.451
Jacob.

36:33.651 --> 36:34.351
Are you ok?

36:34.368 --> 36:35.934
You were running so fast...

36:36.001 --> 36:37.467
Jacob, honey, what happened?!

36:37.534 --> 36:41.034
I'm ok. I just fell.

36:41.101 --> 36:42.991
What are you scared of? Why were you running?

36:42.998 --> 36:46.601
He said there were ghosts!

36:46.667 --> 36:49.567
He said that?

36:49.634 --> 36:50.834
Is that true?

36:50.901 --> 36:53.434
You told this child there were ghosts in his house?

36:53.501 --> 36:55.300
No, I was trying to explain to the parents how this all works...

36:55.367 --> 36:56.934
Wait a minute, how what works?

36:57.001 --> 36:59.334
How your camera takes pictures of things that aren't there?

36:59.400 --> 37:00.634
Or how to make out the check?

37:00.701 --> 37:02.667
Sam, listen, I think that

37:02.734 --> 37:04.667
You don't understand the whole picture.

37:04.734 --> 37:06.701
No, I think I do.

37:06.768 --> 37:08.434
The credit this guy is taking for finding a dead body

37:08.434 --> 37:10.101
actually belongs to someone else,

37:10.168 --> 37:11.700
And none of this has anything to do with ghosts!

37:11.767 --> 37:13.001
- Well, actually...  - No, I know this.

37:13.068 --> 37:14.401
I'm not going to tell you how I know this, but I know it.

37:14.468 --> 37:15.934
No, you don't!

37:16.001 --> 37:18.267
- Melinda, you don't have to defend him...  - Yes, I do!

37:21.268 --> 37:23.134
Linus is telling the truth.

37:23.301 --> 37:25.701
What? I don't understand this.

37:25.768 --> 37:27.501
It's all real.

37:27.568 --> 37:29.934
Linus, the ghost, the machines.

37:30.000 --> 37:34.000
Melinda, I can make you a ghost detector machine in 5 minutes.

37:34.067 --> 37:35.101
You need batteries, diodes, and...

37:35.167 --> 37:36.634
Yeah, except I don't...

37:36.701 --> 37:38.934
I don't need the machine to tell me that it's real.

37:44.101 --> 37:45.634
I see ghosts.

37:47.334 --> 37:49.768
I have since I was a little kid.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.735
All right, if this is supposed to be funny, it's not.

37:52.801 --> 37:54.534
Yeah, I know.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.267
Come on, come on.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.800
What took you? I got everyone here,

38:13.867 --> 38:15.334
But I'm a little stuck without my eyes.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.600
Is this ghost ready for the big crossover?

38:17.667 --> 38:18.833
Why don't you ask him?

38:18.900 --> 38:20.167
Well, he's here, I established that,

38:20.234 --> 38:21.934
I just don't know what kind of mood he's in.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.334
Better than mine.

38:24.600 --> 38:25.633
That thing with Sam?

38:25.700 --> 38:27.067
Let's just get this over with.

38:27.134 --> 38:28.733
That's the attitude.

38:28.800 --> 38:30.833
Carrie, hi.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.817
Your father's here,

38:32.917 --> 38:36.334
And I think there's something he wants to say to you.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.633
Not only her.

38:38.700 --> 38:40.301
I want to say something to Linus.

38:40.367 --> 38:41.900
And to Linus.

38:41.967 --> 38:45.134
I'm sorry that I doubted you

38:45.200 --> 38:48.833
When you told me what you believed about ghosts.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.167
I don't know if I can do this.

38:53.234 --> 38:56.000
I remember when Linus first explained

38:56.067 --> 38:58.767
Where his belief came from.

38:58.833 --> 39:00.800
His guardian angel.

39:03.667 --> 39:07.134
He remembers when you told him about your friend,

39:07.200 --> 39:09.934
The one that died.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.301
That was the first I brought Linus home.

39:13.367 --> 39:17.466
Probably not the best way to make an impression.

39:19.367 --> 39:23.334
I thought he was weak-minded to believe in such nonsense.

39:23.401 --> 39:25.466
Until I was dead, I never...

39:25.933 --> 39:28.734
Understood how alone he must have felt.

39:28.801 --> 39:32.833
Or how strong he was to believe anyway.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.534
Nolan says he never appreciated

39:39.600 --> 39:42.267
How hard it must have been for Linus to believe

39:42.334 --> 39:43.667
When everyone doubted him.

39:43.883 --> 39:45.417
And to think my not believing

39:45.484 --> 39:48.751
Might have ruined their chance at love...

39:50.584 --> 39:53.083
I couldn't go on until I made it right.

39:53.150 --> 39:55.417
Nolan couldn't stand the idea

39:55.484 --> 39:58.716
That his doubt kept you two apart.

39:59.183 --> 40:02.417
So that's when he found Mrs. Bellsbury

40:02.483 --> 40:05.850
And led Linus to her.

40:05.917 --> 40:10.617
He thought if Linus got some credibility for the case,

40:10.684 --> 40:14.350
It would bring Carrie back to you.

40:16.850 --> 40:19.317
Is that about right?

40:22.516 --> 40:24.117
Thank you.

40:25.351 --> 40:27.950
Thank you.

40:29.250 --> 40:32.450
You've given me the greatest joy.

40:44.116 --> 40:46.883
He's crossing over, and he says good-bye.

40:48.516 --> 40:50.750
Come here.

40:53.017 --> 40:55.050
Why is it so hard?

40:55.417 --> 40:57.717
What?

40:58.917 --> 41:00.984
Believing.

41:20.217 --> 41:22.417
You got a minute?

41:28.017 --> 41:29.384
You must hate me right now.

41:29.650 --> 41:30.917
Hate you?

41:31.083 --> 41:34.584
For making you feel bad about...what you do.

41:36.116 --> 41:37.951
Look, who the hell am I to...

41:38.017 --> 41:39.417
It's not your fault.

41:39.483 --> 41:41.984
It's just a sensitive thing for me.

41:42.051 --> 41:44.650
Ever since I lost my memory, and my life.

41:45.817 --> 41:47.884
I try to latch on to things that are solid,

41:48.851 --> 41:51.750
And so it's made me allergic to things that are...

41:51.817 --> 41:53.817
Not so solid.

41:53.884 --> 41:55.717
That makes sense.

41:56.584 --> 41:58.350
It's funny.

41:58.417 --> 42:00.817
Because some of the best things in my life right now

42:00.883 --> 42:03.750
- Make no sense at all.  - Like what?

42:04.417 --> 42:06.317
Like us.

42:06.384 --> 42:08.883
We don't make any sense?

42:08.950 --> 42:10.617
No, me waking up out of this coma

42:10.683 --> 42:13.184
And the only thing I know are my feelings for you.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.551
I can't explain it. I...

42:15.617 --> 42:17.284
I have to rewind the tape.

42:17.350 --> 42:18.783
No, please, let's...

42:18.850 --> 42:20.584
Let's not rewind the tape.

42:20.651 --> 42:22.284
Right.

42:23.584 --> 42:27.651
If you're looking for something solid...

42:27.716 --> 42:30.083
What about ghosts?

42:31.617 --> 42:34.917
Why would I let something I can't see come between us?

42:34.983 --> 42:38.317
Because this thing that I do, it's...

42:38.384 --> 42:41.217
It's a really big part of me,

42:41.284 --> 42:43.783
And if you don't believe in it, I...

42:43.850 --> 42:45.484
Hey, you needed a little time and a little space

42:45.551 --> 42:47.584
To get ready to tell me this.

42:47.651 --> 42:52.317
Let me have the same to get used to it.

42:53.950 --> 42:58.017
tomate todo el tiempo que necesites.

42:58.250 --> 42:59.300
esta bien.

43:01.100 --> 43:02.351
gracias.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
