Louie... **

00:31.599 --> 00:34.202
( audience laughing )

00:34.268 --> 00:35.936
The ten-year-old
is more complicated.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.271
She asks me
a lot of questions,

00:37.338 --> 00:39.440
I have to sort of
be ready for them.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.310
She asked me,
what is prejudice?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.145
They told her in school
to ask me.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.879
Well, they said
ask somebody in your life.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.215
And so she asked me.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.816
She said, what's--
What is prejudice?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.351
And I was like, "Well..."

00:50.418 --> 00:51.752
And she's like, ugh,
why did I ask you?

00:51.819 --> 00:52.986
Jesus Christ.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.455
This is gonna be
a nightmare.

00:54.522 --> 00:59.593
So I told her prejudice
is that you judge before,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.895
Pre-ju-dice.

01:01.962 --> 01:05.166
Pre-judge-sadiz.

01:05.233 --> 01:06.400
You judge before--
That's what prejudice is.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.669
You judged before
you knew any--

01:08.736 --> 01:12.005
You say,
ah, he's gonna--

01:12.072 --> 01:14.575
'Cause he's one of those,
so he's gonna...

01:14.642 --> 01:16.677
That's prejudice.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.113
And she asked me,
have you ever been prejudiced?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.714
And I was like, oh.

01:20.781 --> 01:24.084
Oh, oh my.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.555
Oh, well, I wasn't prepared
for such questions.

01:27.621 --> 01:29.823
I said--

01:29.890 --> 01:31.992
You've got to examine
yourself once in awhile.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.694
You can't just-- just--

01:33.761 --> 01:34.728
You can't just go,
"I voted for Obama,

01:34.795 --> 01:36.897
I can't be prejudiced,
it's impossible."

01:36.964 --> 01:39.032
You have to
still check yourself.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.569
What have I done lately?

01:41.635 --> 01:44.472
And I-- well, I've had
prejudice, like, that's diff--

01:44.538 --> 01:47.808
Like, I want to ( bleep )
Scarlett Johansson.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.278
I don't know her, but I--

01:50.344 --> 01:52.946
I never met her
or saw her in person,

01:53.013 --> 01:55.916
but I-- I just know.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.585
Come on.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.720
I just know that that would be
the greatest thing

01:59.787 --> 02:02.256
that ever happened to me...

02:02.323 --> 02:05.125
and the worst thing that ever
happened to her, but...

02:08.562 --> 02:10.998
I don't even jerk off to her,
that's how much I like her.

02:11.064 --> 02:13.867
But I don't-- I just-- No.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.670
I just--

02:16.737 --> 02:18.539
I still just jerk off
to that wedding album

02:18.606 --> 02:21.342
I found in the garbage,
but...

02:31.084 --> 02:32.720
( Lilly )
So what is it, then?

02:32.786 --> 02:34.422
It's a ty-ranny.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.089
( Louie )
It's-- It is a tyranny.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.858
Whoops, tyranny.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.360
You can say ty-ranny--

02:39.427 --> 02:40.828
I didn't mean to correct you,
I just said it

02:40.894 --> 02:42.830
differently than you--
you can say ty-ranny.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.198
Okay, so I want
to say that.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.733
But most people
say tyranny.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.401
Tyrant, tyranny.

02:47.468 --> 02:49.370
Tyrannical.
That's why--

02:49.437 --> 02:52.105
That's why I say "ty-ranny,"
'cause it's "tyrant."

02:52.172 --> 02:53.541
Tyrant, ty-rannical.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.309
I think there's a good argument
for that,

02:55.376 --> 02:56.977
for just matching them up.
Yeah.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.546
Why are you
changing the vowel,

02:58.612 --> 03:00.448
just 'cause you're using
different--
Yeah.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.253
I'm not sure
why they do that.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.521
Just want to make it
more confusing.

03:09.257 --> 03:10.991
Hey, what's that for?

03:11.058 --> 03:13.060
'Cause it's tax.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.329
Why do I need to
pay you tax?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.598
Because without me, you wouldn't
be able to have it.

03:17.665 --> 03:18.799
See, I'm taking
ten percent.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.268
That's what you're paying.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.535
It's pretty good,
by the way.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.471
Don't take my
ten percent of my food.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.105
Then you get the rest.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.474
You can eat--
You're fine on that.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.076
Daddy, what's a blimp?

03:29.142 --> 03:31.512
It's like a big balloon.

03:31.579 --> 03:35.283
Mommy's friend, Patrick,
said he was on a blimp once.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.819
Yeah, he said
it was scary.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.488
Mommy's friend,
Patrick?

03:41.989 --> 03:43.056
Yeah.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.224
He's pretty funny.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.731
Daddy, when are you
gonna have a girlfriend?

03:51.999 --> 03:53.233
Yeah.

03:53.301 --> 03:57.338
When are you gonna
have a girlfriend?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.409
Come on, get yourself
a girlfriend.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.976
You could date
a veterinarian.

04:03.043 --> 04:03.977
We could play animals
all day.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.882
I think he just needs
to find the right person.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.618
Exactly.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.222
Okay.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.325
( audience laughing )

04:17.391 --> 04:18.692
So I know--

04:18.759 --> 04:20.428
I hope nobody here
is deeply religious.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.363
If you are, please just rest
in the glory

04:22.430 --> 04:24.064
that I am wrong.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.767
I, uh...

04:26.834 --> 04:29.703
My mom is very religious
and I like to leave her messages

04:29.770 --> 04:34.074
on her voicemail from
the Baby Jesus.

04:34.141 --> 04:37.545
( imitating baby speech )
Hi Mommy,
this is Baby Jesus.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.381
If you get the chance,
give me a jingle, jingle.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.851
"Maria, will you stop leaving me
those messages?"

04:43.917 --> 04:45.285
"What messages?"

04:45.353 --> 04:47.621
"The ones from
the Baby Jesus."

04:47.688 --> 04:50.858
"Baby Jesus is leaving you
messages?

04:50.924 --> 04:52.893
Better call him back."

04:54.328 --> 04:57.297
Single lady,
and I do believe in love.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.999
I love love songs.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.202
I do listen to "Love Songs on
the Coast with Delilah."

05:02.269 --> 05:03.737
Where you
calling from tonight?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.506
With requests
and dedications.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.408
What's your name?
Where are you calling from?

05:07.475 --> 05:12.245
( muffled speech )

05:12.312 --> 05:15.282
Hi, Amy, calling in from
Tustin, Arizona.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.250
What's going on
with you tonight, Amy?

05:17.317 --> 05:21.822
( muffled speech )

05:21.889 --> 05:24.858
So you and Matt broke up,
that's hard, that's tough.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.260
Sweetie, what do you want to say
to Matt tonight?

05:27.327 --> 05:32.600
( guttural moaning )

05:32.666 --> 05:35.102
We'll play that for you, that's
"Penny Lover" by Lionel Richie.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.539
Thank you so much.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.207
Enjoy the rest
of the show!

05:40.273 --> 05:41.842
( cheers and applause )

05:46.346 --> 05:47.648
Hey.
Hey!

05:47.715 --> 05:49.149
Hey, great job,
really funny.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.318
Thanks, thanks.

05:51.385 --> 05:52.420
How are you?
Thanks.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.021
Good, good.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.188
How are you?

05:55.255 --> 05:57.425
I'm good as well.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.827
You want to--
You want to hang out?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.762
Hang out where?

06:01.829 --> 06:04.097
Uh, we could--

06:04.164 --> 06:05.165
Oh, you just want
to come over?

06:05.232 --> 06:06.500
Yeah, sure.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.536
Yeah.
Okay, all right.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.903
I'll get my stuff,
I'll-- I'll see you outside.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.238
All right.
Okay.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.973
Okay.
You know what?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.307
I'll meet you at the corner,
I'll get--

06:14.374 --> 06:15.676
Yeah, okay.
I just don't need--

06:15.743 --> 06:17.244
Yeah, right--
yeah, I gotcha.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.746
Okay.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.288
I'm not really good at
confronting people.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.491
Can I sit there?

06:30.558 --> 06:32.225
I'm sitting here.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.661
Okay, you're
a piggy bitch.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.995
That's my magazine.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.830
So do you like
working out a lot?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.799
Yeah, I like
working out.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.434
That's cool.

06:40.501 --> 06:43.003
Both my parents died
when I was a baby,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.872
so I never knew my parents.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.943
Can we have sex again
in a few minutes?

06:50.010 --> 06:53.146
Yeah, you like to?

06:53.213 --> 06:56.316
Not as much as I--

06:56.383 --> 06:58.852
That's why I wanted
to try again.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.754
Okay.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.423
Just give me
a little time, okay?

07:03.491 --> 07:05.693
Don't worry, I'll blow you
so you get hard again.

07:08.896 --> 07:12.065
I am just so sick
of Ellen.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.934
She makes me
feel bad about myself

07:14.001 --> 07:15.869
and I have been trying to be,
like, more assertive.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.707
Ellen.
What?

07:20.974 --> 07:23.010
You ( bleep ) bitch!

07:23.076 --> 07:24.545
I am sick of you!

07:24.612 --> 07:27.214
I am sick of you!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.116
( woman )
Get away now!

07:29.182 --> 07:30.217
I can't believe it!

07:32.986 --> 07:34.955
Hey, can I ask you
something?
Uh-huh.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.691
Do you want to come over
sometime and have dinner?

07:37.758 --> 07:40.528
Like, we'd have dinner?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.429
Are you asking me out
on a date?

07:42.496 --> 07:44.598
No, like if you
came to my place and had--

07:44.665 --> 07:46.800
I would make you dinner
at my place,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.902
and then with
my kids there and...

07:50.571 --> 07:52.840
Go and have dinner with
you and your kids?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.007
Yeah.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.009
Oh.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.978
That's nice.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.818
Why do you want me
to do that?

08:04.885 --> 08:07.254
Because I just thought it--
I thought it'd be nice.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.589
You don't want to?

08:08.656 --> 08:11.491
No, I really
don't want to do that.

08:11.559 --> 08:13.160
I do not want to
meet your kids.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.962
Ugh.
"Ugh"?

08:15.028 --> 08:17.030
Why do you have
to say "Ugh"?

08:17.097 --> 08:19.466
What do you think this is,
like, I'm your girlfriend?

08:19.533 --> 08:21.101
No, I'm--

08:22.870 --> 08:24.672
Just forget it,
I'm sorry.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.944
Jesus, now I'm all
dicked up in the head

08:31.011 --> 08:32.946
and it was so simple
with you.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.114
I'm sorry.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.683
I'm sorry I brought it up,

08:35.749 --> 08:38.552
I'm sorry I dicked you up
in the head.

08:38.619 --> 08:42.022
I'm here for that, and...

08:42.089 --> 08:45.492
and now you're trying to add
features to this thing.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.227
I'm not trying to add--
I'm trying to--

08:48.996 --> 08:50.097
You know what?

08:50.163 --> 08:51.932
Really forget it.
Wow.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.768
Really forget it,
I'm so sorry.

08:54.835 --> 08:58.038
You really ruined my night,
two ways now.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.611
You're bad at sex.
Okay.

09:03.677 --> 09:04.812
You're bad at it,
you're bad at it.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.413
Okay.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.916
No, it's one thing
you're not good at, Louie.
Okay.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.789
It's like they're sticks
except they've got legs,

09:15.856 --> 09:17.524
so they move and stuff.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.426
That's so weird.
Yeah.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.194
I'll see you later, okay?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.330
Have a great day.
Bye.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.220
* Baby *

09:50.423 --> 09:51.859
Bye.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.388
* Baby *

10:58.892 --> 11:03.296
* Baby my baby *

11:06.433 --> 11:08.902
* My, my... **

11:11.538 --> 11:13.140
I only like it this way.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.908
Is that okay?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.132
Can I help you?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.801
Uh, no, no.

12:24.878 --> 12:26.179
Hey, can I--

12:26.246 --> 12:28.816
Can I help you?
Yeah, thank you.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.751
I'm looking for a book
about, uh...

12:31.819 --> 12:34.187
flowers.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.856
Flowers?

12:37.257 --> 12:38.591
You mean, like, information
about flowers or--

12:38.658 --> 12:39.827
Yeah, that's great.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.328
I mean, I--

12:41.394 --> 12:42.896
I need a book about my--

12:42.963 --> 12:45.132
For my kid about flowers,
for a child?

12:45.198 --> 12:46.366
Oh, okay.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.534
I love the kids' books.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.536
You do?
Yeah, come on.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.572
How old's your daughter?

12:52.639 --> 12:54.607
She's ten years old.

12:54.674 --> 12:55.742
She's a fifth-grader.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.511
Hmm, flowers, fifth grade.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.948
Is she a serious kid
or does she like a funny book?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.349
Is there a funny book
about flowers?

13:02.415 --> 13:03.984
Yeah.
Really?

13:04.051 --> 13:05.853
This one's great.

13:05.919 --> 13:07.120
It's got this
really funny character.
Yeah?

13:07.187 --> 13:08.788
He grows flowers
in his apartment.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.024
He has soil all over
the floor.
Mm-hmm.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.692
But inside his home
is a garden.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.728
That's perfect.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.064
That's perfect.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.531
Thank you,
thank you very much.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.000
You're welcome.
That's great.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.803
( Louie )
I still get nervous,
it's fun.

13:23.871 --> 13:24.938
That's the fun part
of dating, is you still--

13:25.005 --> 13:27.640
You ask somebody out and then if
she says yes, you go--

13:27.707 --> 13:30.878
You do that--

13:30.944 --> 13:32.812
That tennis-player thing.

13:34.181 --> 13:38.685
Only tennis and golf players
do that fist pump, the--

13:38.751 --> 13:40.820
And it's because
they're alone.

13:40.888 --> 13:44.257
It's 'cause
they're by themselves.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.259
If you're a baseball player,
you go to your teammate

13:46.326 --> 13:49.696
and you go
boom-boom-boom, or what--

13:49.762 --> 13:51.698
High-five, all those things.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.233
Hug.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.435
By yourself on a tennis court,
you just--

14:02.509 --> 14:04.077
( man )
Louis C.K.!

14:04.144 --> 14:06.446
( cheers and applause )

14:21.861 --> 14:23.897
Hi.
Hey.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.198
How you doing?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.900
Did your daughter
like the book?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.035
You know what?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.736
It was kind of
little for her.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.471
Really?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.773
Yeah, she's really into kind of
heavy novels right now.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.175
Wow.

14:35.242 --> 14:38.145
Yeah, just really
mysterious and serious.

14:38.211 --> 14:41.448
Just depressing stuff,
man, yeah.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.016
But her sister loved it.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.751
Oh, there's another one.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.719
Yeah, I guess they
keep multiplying.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.121
How many do you have?
Two.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.856
I have a six and
a ten-year-old,

14:49.923 --> 14:52.059
both girls,
and I'm divorced.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.061
Oh, I think it's great that
you pay so much attention

14:54.127 --> 14:56.129
to what they read

14:56.196 --> 14:58.031
and I think it's great that
you come into a real bookstore

14:58.098 --> 15:00.533
instead of just
perusing Amazon.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.202
Bravo.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.538
* Baby my baby **

15:08.841 --> 15:10.443
Thank you.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.645
That's-- that'll get me
through the day.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.647
Do you want to get something
for your ten-year-old?

15:14.714 --> 15:15.915
That-- Yes, please.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.917
Do you have
any depressing novels

15:17.985 --> 15:19.752
about people's heads
falling off?

15:19.819 --> 15:21.488
Terrible things happening?

15:21.554 --> 15:24.757
Yeah, yeah, come over here
for a second.
Okay.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.627
If you just push this
really hard,

15:27.694 --> 15:29.496
it'll turn
into another room.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.464
Really? You're--

15:31.531 --> 15:34.101
No, I think I know
what she likes.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.868
She sounds
like me at her age.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.004
She does?
Yeah.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.338
You were like--

15:38.405 --> 15:40.273
What's going on with her,
since you--

15:40.340 --> 15:43.610
Well, I don't want to break
the covenant of what it is

15:43.676 --> 15:45.678
to be a little girl,

15:45.745 --> 15:47.547
the kind of things you want
to keep from your parents--

15:47.614 --> 15:49.482
Oh yeah, sure.
--and everyone else
in the world.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.783
But I will say this.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.753
There are things about being
female that at that age,

15:53.820 --> 15:56.123
it starts coming online.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.891
And so some of these books
take these feelings,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.860
these big emotions,

16:00.927 --> 16:04.964
they let you take them out for
a safe kind of spin, you know.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.366
That's--

16:06.433 --> 16:08.635
That's massively
helpful to me

16:08.701 --> 16:10.737
and very terrifying.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.539
Like, deep fear.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.807
Yeah, well, just keep
bringing her the books.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.576
She'll be fine.
Okay.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.318
Has she read this?
I don't think so.

16:25.385 --> 16:28.055
Okay, give her this, but tell
her not to read it at night

16:28.121 --> 16:29.889
because it's too scary.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.391
Oh, well, maybe--

16:31.458 --> 16:33.326
The idea is that she will
read it at night.

16:33.393 --> 16:37.397
It will be like a little
wrongful thrill for her.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.399
That's great.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.469
You are helping me
so much right now.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.371
Wow.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.639
Thank you.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.874
Sure.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.842
Do you need
anything else?

16:49.909 --> 16:51.811
No, no, thanks a lot.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.580
This is great,
thank you.

16:53.646 --> 16:54.747
You're welcome.

16:54.814 --> 16:57.484
* Baby my baby *

17:00.887 --> 17:02.589
* My, my *

17:02.655 --> 17:06.259
* I love *

17:06.326 --> 17:07.894
* So break up with her *

17:07.960 --> 17:11.764
* And stay with me **

17:27.780 --> 17:29.116
Hi.
( gasps )

17:29.182 --> 17:31.784
I'm sorry,
I'm a monster.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.953
Sorry about that, I--

17:34.020 --> 17:36.256
Did Lilly like the book?
You know what?

17:36.323 --> 17:38.425
I didn't give it to her yet
'cause she's on another one,

17:38.491 --> 17:42.061
so it's next up,
but thank you, I--

17:42.129 --> 17:44.431
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.898
Uh--
It's--

17:45.965 --> 17:48.000
Okay.
Okay?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.303
Um, let's--

17:53.173 --> 17:55.007
Thanks, I--

17:55.074 --> 17:57.810
I, um... Uh, okay.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.513
You know, the--

18:00.580 --> 18:02.949
This kind of thing is
so awkward and horrible

18:03.015 --> 18:05.285
that, you know,
from your end, it must--

18:05.352 --> 18:07.787
Okay, I'm gonna come out and
tell you, I'm asking you out.

18:07.854 --> 18:08.955
That's what I'm doing.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.223
And please don't
answer yet,

18:10.290 --> 18:11.524
because I know you
might have a "no"

18:11.591 --> 18:13.493
queued up in your
head already and I--

18:13.560 --> 18:14.494
But I please--

18:14.561 --> 18:16.763
Will you let me say
a few things?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.531
I...

18:18.598 --> 18:22.001
I know that being a woman
in New York must be hard

18:22.068 --> 18:24.671
because it's basically
disappointing maybe

18:24.737 --> 18:27.307
that you try to be
nice to men as human beings,

18:27.374 --> 18:29.108
and then they respond

18:29.176 --> 18:32.245
by just torpedoing
towards your vagina.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.114
I want you to know
that I'm aware

18:35.182 --> 18:37.150
that you're
young and beautiful

18:37.217 --> 18:39.819
and I'm not either of those
things and I--

18:39.886 --> 18:41.888
Part of me knows that as
soon as my lips stop moving,

18:41.954 --> 18:43.890
you're gonna say no,
but I--

18:43.956 --> 18:47.560
Please think of the fact that
it's low-risk, what I'm asking.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.862
You just come out
with me for a drink,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.331
and even if you
got up and left

18:51.398 --> 18:53.099
in the middle of the one
drink, I wouldn't--

18:53.166 --> 18:55.001
I wouldn't hold it
against you.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.570
So just make a judgment
based on that

18:57.637 --> 19:01.174
nothing horrible would happen
if you came out with me.

19:01.241 --> 19:04.311
I think you're so attractive,
I'm attracted to you

19:04.377 --> 19:07.980
because you're nice
and you're a decent person,

19:08.047 --> 19:09.316
and those are--

19:09.382 --> 19:10.850
And other reasons
you probably want people

19:10.917 --> 19:12.051
to be attracted to you.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.020
And also, you're all
horribly cute.

19:14.086 --> 19:16.456
I mean, you're
cute as hell and I--

19:16.523 --> 19:18.858
I grow on people, women,
when they-- You get--

19:18.925 --> 19:21.894
Some time goes by, you get
past the bald head and the--

19:21.961 --> 19:24.897
I sweat a lot
and I'm lumpy.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.733
I've run out of things
to say.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.901
Can you just say--
Tell me now, if it's--

19:28.968 --> 19:30.169
Did this work,
are you gonna?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.705
I don't date guys,
I'm a lesbian.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.608
I'm just kidding.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.378
Of course I'll have a drink
with you, why not?

19:38.445 --> 19:40.513
Oh, my God, really?

19:40.580 --> 19:41.781
Yes.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.618
I don't choose guys
based on looks.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.487
Made for a really
shitty life for me.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.256
And you're not a troll,
for Christ's sake.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.523
Get some confidence.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.191
I'll have it up
and running.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.327
Do you want to
pick me up tonight?

19:54.394 --> 19:56.329
Tonight?
Yeah.
At 8:00?

19:56.396 --> 19:57.397
Yes, please.
When I get off?

19:57.464 --> 19:58.531
That'd be great.
Okay.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.533
Nice job on
the asking out.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.235
Thank you.
I liked it.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.903
A-plus.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.296
So where
are you from?

20:29.362 --> 20:31.898
California.
Oh, are you really?

20:31.964 --> 20:34.066
Yes, I am really.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.202
Of course you are.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.070
Yeah, of course I am.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.607
So I'm sitting on the couch
between Kayla and Kendra.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.276
I ask Kayla where she's from,
she says California.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.345
Kendra's like, oh,
yeah, I bet you are.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.514
Kayla was like, yeah,
yeah, I am.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.916
Kendra's like,
yeah, I bet you are.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.818
And Kayla said, yeah, I am.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.320
I like Albert.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.655
The others are okay.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.890
But I really
want to go home.
