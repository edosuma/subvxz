STEVE, WHAT ARE

02:07.928 --> 02:11.232
SPREADING CHRISTMAS CHEER,
MY LITTLE CANDY CANE.

02:11.299 --> 02:14.602
YOU TOLD ME YOUR FAMILY
WAS GOING TO HAWAII
FOR TWO WEEKS.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.405
MY PARENTS WENT ALONE
TO RENEW THEIR VOWS.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.906
SECOND HONEYMOON?

02:18.972 --> 02:22.243
NO, THEIR RENEWING VOWS
NOT TO HAVE
ANY MORE CHILDREN.

02:24.245 --> 02:27.315
LUCKY ME, I GET
TO SPEND CHRISTMAS
WITH UNCLE CECIL.

02:27.381 --> 02:31.118
WASN'T HE BUSTED FOR
OPERATING AN UNLICENSED
HOT TUB CLUB?

02:31.185 --> 02:32.520
HE BEAT THAT RAP

02:32.586 --> 02:34.121
WITH POLAROIDS
OF THE JUDGE

02:34.188 --> 02:37.725
TICKLING THE BAILIFF
WITH A RUBBER DUCKIE.

02:40.661 --> 02:44.031
SO YOU'LL BE AROUND
ALL CHRISTMAS VACATION?

02:44.097 --> 02:45.333
YEP.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.935
WOW...

02:48.001 --> 02:49.537
BY SHEER
COINCIDENCE,

02:49.603 --> 02:52.740
WE JUST HAPPEN TO
BE STANDING UNDER
SOME MISTLETOE.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.879
LET US HONOR TRADITION
WITH A KISS.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.739
HEY!

03:25.806 --> 03:26.807
CARL...

03:26.874 --> 03:29.743
RICHIE WANTS
A FREDDY TEDDY
FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.844
A WHAT?

03:30.911 --> 03:34.415
A BATTERY-OPERATED BEAR
THAT MOVES HIS MOUTH,

03:34.482 --> 03:36.884
BLINKS HIS EYES,
AND TELLS STORIES.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.587
SOUNDS LIKE THE GUY
I WENT OUT WITH LAST WEEK.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.955
EXCEPT HIS BATTERY'S
WENT DEAD.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.795
ANYWAY, IT'S THE ONLY TOY
LITTLE RICHIE WANTS
FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.930
HE HAS WRITTEN TO
SANTA CLAUS SIX TIMES

03:49.997 --> 03:54.302
IN CASE THE FIRST FIVE LETTERS
GET LOST IN THE MAIL.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.036
SO WHAT IS IT?
YOU NEED SOME MONEY?

03:56.103 --> 03:58.772
IS FUDDY DUDDY
EXPENSIVE?

04:00.040 --> 04:01.942
FREDDY TEDDY.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.577
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.780
I'VE BEEN TO EVERY
TOY STORE IN TOWN,
AND THEY'RE ALL SOLD OUT.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.984
THE TOY COMPANIES
DELIBERATELY
CREATE A SHORTAGE,

04:11.051 --> 04:13.754
WHICH INCREASES DEMAND,
WHICH SHOOTS UP
THEIR PROFITS.

04:13.821 --> 04:14.922
RACHEL..

04:14.988 --> 04:17.391
THEY DON'T GIVE A HOOT
ABOUT THE CUSTOMER.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.059
IT'S JUST
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

04:19.126 --> 04:20.160
IT JUST
BURNS MY BOOTS.

04:20.227 --> 04:21.529
RACHEL.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.831
I'M CALLING
MY CONGRESSMAN.
NO, THE SENATOR.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.533
FORGET THAT--
THE PRESIDENT!

04:25.599 --> 04:27.067
I'LL CALL AL MUSHMAN.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.369
OH...WHO?

04:28.436 --> 04:31.004
AL MUSHMAN,
OUR EQUIPMENT
SUPPLY OFFICER.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.406
HE CAN FIND ANYTHING.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.976
IF THERE'S A FUNKY FRANKIE
WITHIN 500 SQUARE MILES--

04:39.279 --> 04:41.849
FREDDY TEDDY.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.016
WHATEVER.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.918
MUSHMAN WILL KNOW
WHERE IT IS.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.119
CARL.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.356
IS AL MUSHMAN CUTE?

04:49.890 --> 04:51.325
HE'S ALRIGHT.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.761
IS HE SINGLE?

04:53.827 --> 04:54.562
YEAH.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.064
AND HE CAN FIND ANYTHING?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.566
RIGHT, MAMA.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.402
TELL HIM HE CAN FIND ME
HERE TONIGHT AT 8 O'CLOCK.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.910
OH, MOM, LOOK.
I FOUND THE ORNAMENT
GRANDMA BAKER GAVE ME.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.012
OH, IT'S SO PRETTY.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.448
IT'S ALMOST AS OLD
AS I AM.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.049
LET'S SEE,
THAT MEANS IT'S--

05:16.116 --> 05:17.184
YEP...

05:17.250 --> 05:19.853
ALMOST 21 YEARS OLD.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.525
GOSH, YOU GUYS ARE
THE PERFECT FAMILY.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.094
LOOK HOW YOU'VE
DECKED THESE HALLS.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.562
THANK YOU, STEVE.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.864
YOU PUT THE MERRY

05:30.931 --> 05:32.065
THE NO IN NOEL,

05:32.132 --> 05:35.002
THE SP...
IN SPIRIT.

05:36.770 --> 05:39.239
JUDY, COME UP
TO THE ATTIC.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.442
WE FORGOT
THE TREE SKIRT.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.945
HAVE I MENTIONED THAT
I'D LIKE A CD PLAYER?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.681
JUDY,
GIVE IT A REST.

05:52.319 --> 05:53.787
PSST...

05:58.426 --> 05:59.960
WHOA...OH.

06:01.429 --> 06:04.698
GUESS WHAT?
I'M ASKING SANTA
FOR A FREDDY TEDDY.

06:04.765 --> 06:07.468
REALLY? HAVE YOU BEEN
GOOD THIS YEAR?

06:07.535 --> 06:10.137
I HAD A PRETTY GOOD
AUGUST.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.508
THAT'S A KEY MONTH.
YOU'LL GET FREDDY TEDDY.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.545
THANKS,
UNCLE STEVE.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.780
UNCLE STEVE...

06:19.847 --> 06:22.049
AHH...

06:22.115 --> 06:23.383
I JUST LOVE CHILDREN.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.619
THEY'RE STILL YOUNG
ENOUGH TO RESPECT ME.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.256
STEVE, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD RICHIE

06:29.322 --> 06:31.759
SANTA WOULD BRING HIM
A FREDDY TEDDY.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.461
WHY IN HEAVEN'S NAME NOT?

06:33.527 --> 06:35.963
AUNT RACHEL'S
HAVING TROUBLE
FINDING ONE.

06:36.029 --> 06:38.432
WHY IS SHE EVEN TRYING?
THAT'S SANTA'S JOB.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.205
UH...
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

06:45.272 --> 06:46.940
ABOUT WHAT?

06:48.442 --> 06:51.845
STEVE, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU STILL BELIEVE
IN SANTA CLAUS?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.447
OF COURSE.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.148
BUT STEVE, UH,

06:55.215 --> 06:57.885
HASN'T ANYONE
EVER TOLD YOU
THAT HE'S NOT REAL?

06:57.951 --> 07:02.990
WELL, I'VE HEARD RUMORS,
BUT I TRY TO IGNORE
VICIOUS GOSSIP.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.091
YOU KNOW...

07:04.157 --> 07:06.126
THERE'S EVEN
AN UGLY RUMOR
FLOATING AROUND

07:06.193 --> 07:08.161
THAT I'M A NERD.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.701
STEVE, THERE IS
NO SANTA C--

07:15.035 --> 07:16.169
SHH.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.773
HE MIGHT HEAR YOU.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.010
STEVE, HE'S RIGHT.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.344
YOU, TOO, LAURA?

07:24.411 --> 07:27.715
YOU'VE SWALLOWED
THIS BILGE WATER?

07:27.781 --> 07:31.184
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR
ONE GUY TO DELIVER TOYS

07:31.251 --> 07:34.922
TO EVERY KID
IN THE ENTIRE WORLD
IN ONE NIGHT?

07:34.988 --> 07:37.758
WELL, IT'S A MIRACLE, LAURA.
YOU DON'T ANALYZE MIRACLES,

07:37.825 --> 07:39.426
YOU JUST
BELIEVE IN THEM.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.228
OH, PLEASE.

07:42.896 --> 07:46.800
HOW CAN I SHOW YOU
THAT THERE REALLY IS
A SANTA?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.468
OH!

07:48.536 --> 07:50.604
AH!

07:50.671 --> 07:52.205
WELL, I KNOW!

07:52.272 --> 07:55.909
I'LL WRITE DOWN
WHAT I WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.645
THEN I'LL SEAL IT

07:57.711 --> 07:59.980
AND MAIL IT TO YOU
BY REGISTERED MAIL.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.282
WE'LL OPEN IT
CHRISTMAS MORNING

08:02.349 --> 08:05.485
AND SEE IF I GOT
WHAT I WANTED.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.220
GOOD IDEA.
IN FACT...

08:07.287 --> 08:09.322
WHY DON'T YOU
RUN HOME NOW

08:09.389 --> 08:11.525
AND GET STARTED
ON THAT NOTE?

08:11.592 --> 08:13.493
I'M LICKETY-SPLITTING.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.731
STEVE!

08:19.066 --> 08:21.068
DID I DO THAT?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.372
STEVE, YOU BROKE
MY FAVORITE ORNAMENT.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.908
LAURA, I'LL BUY YOU
ANOTHER ONE.

08:27.975 --> 08:28.909
YOU CAN'T.
IT'S AN ANTIQUE.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.579
IT'S AS OLD
AS MY MOTHER.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.648
OH, WELL,
GEE, I'M SORRY.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.650
YOU'RE ALWAYS SORRY.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.286
I DON'T
WANT YOU OVER HERE
CHRISTMAS MORNING.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.855
I DON'T WANT YOU
HERE EVER AGAIN.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.729
THEN THAT WILL BE
MY CHRISTMAS PRESENT
TO YOU.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.698
MERRY CHRISTMAS, LAURA.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.548
HURRY UP.

09:15.923 --> 09:19.492
HOW MANY OF YOU ARE HERE
FOR A FREDDY TEDDY?

09:19.559 --> 09:20.928
I AM.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.064
THEN THE PRICE
JUST WENT UP TO $90.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.934
$90! OH, MY GOD.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.639
MA'AM, I'M GOING TO
HAVE TO CALL THIS IN.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.573
AW.
AW.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.715
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WAITING, SIR?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.416
ALMOST 3 1/2 HOURS,

09:43.483 --> 09:45.452
AND I DROVE
50 MILES TO GET HERE.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.788
OH, MY GOODNESS.

09:47.855 --> 09:51.324
WHAT WE GO THROUGH
FOR OUR CHILDREN
AND GRANDCHILDREN.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.861
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.399
IT'S WORTH IT, THOUGH,

09:59.466 --> 10:01.034
TO SEE
THEIR LITTLE FACES

10:01.101 --> 10:05.105
LIGHT UP WITH JOY
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.907
RIGHT.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.983
AFTER ALL,
WE LOVE OUR KIDS,

10:16.049 --> 10:20.353
AND LOVE IS WHAT
CHRISTMAS IS ALL ABOUT.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.289
YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

10:32.766 --> 10:36.369
FINALLY.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.637
I'M SORRY, FOLKS,

10:37.705 --> 10:39.506
BUT THIS IS
THE LAST FREDDY TEDDY.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.674
WHAT?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.109
COME ON.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.813
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR!

10:45.879 --> 10:48.716
I'M SORRY,
BUT WE'RE SOLD OUT.

10:48.782 --> 10:51.184
THIS BOHUNK

11:38.698 --> 11:40.367
HI, MOM.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.535
HELLO.
FINISH YOUR SHOPPING?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.037
YEAH.
THE MALL WAS MOBBED.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.606
THE STORES
ONLY HAD STUFF LEFT
THAT NOBODY WANTS.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.242
WHERE'S JUDY'S
COMPACT DISC?

11:51.278 --> 11:55.382
WILLARD SCOTT SINGS
HIS FAVORITE CAMP SONGS?

11:55.448 --> 11:56.716
WELL, THAT'S ALL
THEY HAD.

11:56.784 --> 12:00.020
OOH, LOOK.
BRYANT GUMBEL
SINGS BACKUP.

12:04.691 --> 12:07.460
OH, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, HONEY?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.630
WELL...

12:10.697 --> 12:13.066
I GUESS I'M FEELING
A LITTLE GUILTY.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.467
ABOUT WHAT?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.770
THE WAY I TREATED STEVE.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.573
WHEN HE BROKE
MY ORNAMENT,
I JUST...FREAKED.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.877
OH, HONEY,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.414
STEVE CAN'T SEEM
TO HELP BEING CLUMSY.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.849
I KNOW.
WHEN HE WAS A BABY,

12:28.916 --> 12:31.384
I BET
HIS FIRST WORDS WERE,

12:31.451 --> 12:33.987
"DID I DO THAT?"

12:38.091 --> 12:40.227
SO YOU WANT TO
APOLOGIZE?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.129
NO.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.932
BUT I GUESS
I SHOULD, HUH?

12:46.066 --> 12:49.202
EARLIER, I HEARD HIM
SINGING IN HIS BASEMENT.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.873
EITHER THAT, OR SOMEBODY'S
TORTURING A CAT.

12:57.377 --> 13:01.714
* HAVE MYSELF
A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS *

13:01.781 --> 13:04.651
* MAKE THE YULETIDE
BRIGHT *

13:04.717 --> 13:06.119
* FROM NOW ON *

13:06.186 --> 13:10.323
* MY TROUBLES WILL BE
OUT OF SIGHT *

13:19.666 --> 13:22.002
WELL, MY TREE IS UP.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.409
WHAT DO I DO NOW?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.777
I KNOW.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.713
I'LL COUNT
MY CHRISTMAS CARDS AGAIN.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.582
ONE.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.254
NOW I'LL READ IT.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.558
"WARMEST HOLIDAY
GREETINGS

13:45.625 --> 13:48.962
FROM ALL YOUR FRIENDS
AT THE ALLERGY INSTITUTE."

13:50.230 --> 13:51.865
[DING]

13:51.932 --> 13:54.434

14:10.750 --> 14:11.818

14:11.885 --> 14:12.819
OH, WOW.

HELLO, STEVE.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.043
OH, LAURA,

14:36.109 --> 14:37.844
WHY, YOU LOOK PRETTIER

14:37.911 --> 14:40.914

14:40.981 --> 14:42.815
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:42.882 --> 14:44.985
WEREN'T YOU GOING TO
YOUR UNCLE CECIL'S?

14:45.052 --> 14:47.020
OH, WELL,
HE GOT ARRESTED.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.690
OH. WHAT HAPPENED?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.459
HE DRANK EGGNOG,

14:52.525 --> 14:55.963
PUT ON HIS STOCKING CAP,
AND WENT CAROLING.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.164
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

14:57.230 --> 14:59.933
ALL HE HAD ON
WAS HIS STOCKING CAP.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.608
SO YOU'RE SPENDING
CHRISTMAS ALL ALONE?

15:08.675 --> 15:09.676
YEP.

15:09.742 --> 15:13.146
YEP, YEP, YEP, YEP.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.285
I'VE GOT MY CHRISTMAS TREE,
MY CHRISTMAS CARD

15:18.351 --> 15:21.121
AND, HEY,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.425
LOOK, STEVE,
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

15:32.632 --> 15:33.433

OH, YES, IT IS.
THAT'S WHERE I ALWAYS

18:54.734 --> 18:58.571
NOW YOU'LL ALWAYS
HAVE ME WITH YOU.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.474
WELL, GO AHEAD,
PULL THE STRING.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.511
DID I DO THAT?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.180

19:07.247 --> 19:10.583

19:47.954 --> 19:49.456
STEVE, DID YOU GET IT?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.790
NOT ME.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.062
OH, COME ON, WHERE DID IT
COME FROM?

19:56.128 --> 19:59.532
SANTA BROUGHT IT,
RIGHT, UNCLE STEVE?

19:59.599 --> 20:02.269
WELL, NONE OF US DID.
IT HAD TO BE SANTA.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.139
BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.876
