00:46.786 --> 00:50.656
Maura, what time is Jane's
doctor's appointment tomorrow?

00:50.690 --> 00:51.957
I forgot to write it down.

00:51.992 --> 00:54.293
I forgot to tell you
you don't need to cover it.

00:54.327 --> 00:55.794
I can take her after all.

00:55.829 --> 00:58.931
I thought tomorrow was the
first day of your seminar at BCU.

00:58.999 --> 01:02.768
It was, um, but I realized that
as a doctor, I am best poised

01:02.836 --> 01:04.670
to ensure the quality
of your medical care.

01:04.703 --> 01:07.273
<i>You could go to your class.
We'll be fine.</i>

01:07.307 --> 01:10.576
I've given birth to three kids, and...

01:10.610 --> 01:13.712
I've got enough poise
for one O.B. appointment.

01:15.615 --> 01:17.182
Okay.

01:17.217 --> 01:19.885
- Shall we?
- Not so fast, professor.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.022
Why are you trying to
get out of teaching this class?

01:23.056 --> 01:24.790
I told you...

01:24.824 --> 01:28.127
because of my love and devotion
for you above all else.

01:28.161 --> 01:30.129
Nope, didn't sell it.
What's up?

01:31.231 --> 01:33.799
I...
the department head...

01:33.833 --> 01:36.302
he told me that he is so excited
about my syllabus

01:36.336 --> 01:38.904
that he wants it to be
a course for credit.

01:38.939 --> 01:42.741
- Okay, how is that bad news?
- I'll have to give grades.

01:42.776 --> 01:44.944
Yeah, I don't want that burden
on my shoulders.

01:44.978 --> 01:49.348
I'm still scarred over the A-minus
biochemistry incident in 1996.

01:49.382 --> 01:51.584
I can't even imagine
just crushing the spirit

01:51.651 --> 01:54.520
- of young, budding minds like that.
- Your budding mind

01:54.521 --> 01:57.356
was hardly crushed, and it's med school.

01:57.390 --> 01:59.925
The budding minds of today
will have patients tomorrow.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.195
So... grade hard,
save lives.

02:03.229 --> 02:05.197
Mm.

02:08.133 --> 02:11.236
Hello?

02:11.271 --> 02:13.538
Yes, governor. Hello.

02:14.407 --> 02:16.809
H-h-how can I help you?

02:18.812 --> 02:21.280
Of course I understand.

02:21.314 --> 02:24.617
Thank you, governor.
Okay.

02:24.651 --> 02:26.819
If he wants his nephew
to get an "A" in your course,

02:26.853 --> 02:28.821
say no... at least until
the second offer.

02:28.855 --> 02:31.023
He wants me to facilitate
a death certificate.

02:31.057 --> 02:33.392
Chelsea Rothsburgher passed
away last night. Cancer.

02:33.426 --> 02:35.227
I guess they were close.

02:35.261 --> 02:37.096
Would you like to come with me,
or should I take my own car?

02:37.163 --> 02:39.264
Well, how long
does facilitating take?

02:39.299 --> 02:41.266
If I'm just signing, 15 minutes.

02:41.301 --> 02:43.268
Yeah, all right. I'll take you.

02:43.303 --> 02:45.137
That would be great.
Thanks.

02:45.205 --> 02:47.840
Uh, you do understand that
this is a favor to the governor.

02:47.874 --> 02:50.009
Yes, I was right here
when he asked you a minute ago.

02:50.043 --> 02:52.344
That means
no "Downton Abbey" jokes.

02:52.379 --> 02:54.113
- Okay, no problem.
- You promise?

02:54.180 --> 02:58.951
I promise...
milady.

03:04.858 --> 03:05.858
Mm.

03:39.276 --> 03:42.278
That's a little unnecessary.

03:45.115 --> 03:47.116
- Oh, shoot!
- What's wrong?

03:47.150 --> 03:49.118
I left my monocle in the car.

03:49.152 --> 03:51.854
You didn't last 30 seconds.

03:51.888 --> 03:53.889
Well, what am I supposed
to do if I get surprised?

03:53.924 --> 03:56.042
Normally, I would gasp,
and the monocle would

03:56.043 --> 03:58.227
- pop out of my eye socket.
- Very funny.

03:58.261 --> 04:00.062
But your snarky remarks
are rife with errors.

04:00.096 --> 04:02.064
It's your eye orbit, not socket.

04:02.098 --> 04:04.333
And while monocles were
very common in the 1880s,

04:04.401 --> 04:06.969
by 1912, when "Downton
Abbey" takes place,

04:07.003 --> 04:09.939
upper-class men wore glasses
due to advances in optometry,

04:09.973 --> 04:11.774
allowing for better
measurement of refractions.

04:11.808 --> 04:14.109
- So the joke is on you.
- Really?

04:14.144 --> 04:16.095
Oh, and the reason you don't
know that is because you've

04:16.096 --> 04:18.047
never stayed awake long
enough to see one full episode.

04:18.113 --> 04:20.716
It's called meditating.
It's how I focus.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.351
You've never respected that.

04:22.385 --> 04:24.753
The puddle of drool makes it hard.

04:33.730 --> 04:36.632
She was diagnosed with
ovarian cancer two years ago.

04:36.666 --> 04:39.668
If you have questions,
I know every aspect

04:39.703 --> 04:41.203
of her medical history and care.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.005
Thank you.

04:43.039 --> 04:46.241
And, as I said, I have
prepared her death certificate,

04:46.276 --> 04:48.310
so you just need to sign it.

04:48.345 --> 04:50.312
I'm almost done.

04:55.652 --> 04:59.822
The president used it...
to sign the "No child goes hungry" bill.

04:59.856 --> 05:01.824
She was a very impressive woman.

05:01.858 --> 05:04.393
I worked for her for 20 years.

05:04.427 --> 05:06.762
I'm... I'm so sorry for your loss.

05:08.264 --> 05:09.264
<i>Jane.</i>

05:11.835 --> 05:14.069
Excuse me.

05:21.211 --> 05:25.481
- I can't sign the death certificate.
- Well, there's a very fancy pen

05:25.482 --> 05:27.216
over there if yours isn't working.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.018
Her bedclothes are soaked with sweat,

05:29.052 --> 05:31.120
and there are fresh bite
marks inside her mouth,

05:31.154 --> 05:34.089
indicating violent seizures.
I don't know how she died,

05:34.157 --> 05:36.759
But I know it wasn't the
cancer that killed her.

05:36.793 --> 05:38.427
Well, then, you need to do an autopsy.

05:38.461 --> 05:40.062
Well, in a perfect world,

05:40.096 --> 05:42.798
but there are certain
sensitive hierarchical issues.

05:42.832 --> 05:45.918
Because Dr. Elbow patches
over there is the chief

05:45.919 --> 05:49.004
medical examiner of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts?

05:49.039 --> 05:50.305
No, wait!

05:50.340 --> 05:54.743
- You are. Problem solved.
- Dr. Isles, are you quite finished?

05:54.811 --> 05:56.311
Yes. Thank you.

05:56.346 --> 06:00.215
I am afraid this is a suspicious death,
and I'm ordering an autopsy.

06:00.283 --> 06:01.984
You can't do that.

06:02.018 --> 06:05.821
I am the chief medical examiner,
so I respectfully disagree.

06:05.855 --> 06:07.156
Hi.

06:07.223 --> 06:09.725
I'm... Detective Jane Rizzoli,
Boston Homicide.

06:09.793 --> 06:12.928
Um, if you're quite finished,
we'll take it from here.

06:12.962 --> 06:15.698
- I'm calling the governor!
- Great!

06:15.732 --> 06:18.300
Do it outside. This
is now a crime scene.

06:21.938 --> 06:23.739
See, if he was wearing a monocle,

06:23.773 --> 06:26.041
we would know if he was
shocked or horrified.

06:27.811 --> 06:29.912
Now we can only suspect.

06:33.183 --> 06:37.086
- How many times has he called?
- By my count, a lot.

06:37.120 --> 06:41.356
- 27, to be exact.
- All right, well, if he hasn't already

06:41.424 --> 06:43.225
sent a governor's aide
over here to shut you down,

06:43.259 --> 06:46.161
he will do so very soon.
So you almost done?

06:46.196 --> 06:48.430
Uh, yes. I'm moving as fast as I can

06:48.465 --> 06:50.766
while still following protocol.

06:50.800 --> 06:55.037
I've ruled out seizures due to
heart attack, epilepsy, stroke,

06:55.105 --> 06:57.339
meningitis, encephalitis,
and toxoplasmosis.

06:57.373 --> 06:59.074
There's one other possibility.

06:59.142 --> 07:02.277
And instead of testing for that,
you're gonna buy a goldfish?

07:02.312 --> 07:05.247
No, I'm setting up a variation
of the pyrogallol test.

07:07.450 --> 07:10.185
Okay, how much time do you need
before the fish tank is up and running?

07:10.220 --> 07:11.420
I need a few minutes.

07:11.454 --> 07:12.454
Okay. You got it.

07:13.857 --> 07:16.391
- What are you going to do?
- You don't want to know.

07:16.426 --> 07:18.093
- Jane.
- Yeah?

07:18.161 --> 07:20.529
- Thank you.
- For what?

07:20.563 --> 07:23.832
The... plausible deniability,
the support, the friendship.

07:23.867 --> 07:26.301
You're welcome.

07:28.138 --> 07:31.340
Hello?
Yes, can you connect me

07:31.374 --> 07:33.375
to the medical
examiner's office, please?

07:33.409 --> 07:37.012
Excuse me?
No, I'm trying to place a call.

07:37.046 --> 07:38.113
Who are you?

07:39.382 --> 07:41.884
Really, you expect me to
believe that the governor

07:41.885 --> 07:44.386
answers phones at the
medical examiner's office?

07:44.420 --> 07:46.522
Chelsea Rothsburgher's net worth
is in the hundreds of millions.

07:46.556 --> 07:49.491
Her husband, Larry Sr.,
was a financial genius.

07:49.526 --> 07:53.428
He started his company with
$1,000 and a copy machine.

07:53.463 --> 07:57.332
He died in '05.
Used to be king of the tabloids.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.401
So, who had easy access to the house?

07:59.469 --> 08:01.336
Household staff and her two sons.

08:01.371 --> 08:04.139
We've got uniforms setting
up interviews right now.

08:04.207 --> 08:07.009
Are we pushing hard or hardly pushing?

08:07.043 --> 08:09.945
Until we get a cause of
death, somewhere in between.

08:13.082 --> 08:14.449
Okay.

08:14.484 --> 08:17.619
Just pranked the governor
for... whatever this is.

08:17.654 --> 08:19.822
I'm gonna put Chelsea's
heart in the water,

08:19.856 --> 08:22.424
and then I'm gonna remove the
clamp from the pulmonary artery.

08:22.492 --> 08:25.227
And if my suspicions are correct,
we'll know right away.

08:25.261 --> 08:27.963
- You ready?
- For what?

08:27.997 --> 08:30.599
To bask... in the wonder

08:30.633 --> 08:34.236
that is scientific
experimentation together.

08:34.270 --> 08:37.405
Or individually.
Here we go.

08:43.446 --> 08:47.082
Ohh.
Wow!

08:47.116 --> 08:51.478
Wow!
That is... Wow!

08:51.513 --> 08:54.523
- You see what I mean?
- I'm still basking.

08:54.557 --> 08:58.493
- Di... what do the bubbles mean?
- Uh, well, first off,

08:58.528 --> 09:00.395
in a kinetic and
spectroelectrochemistry study...

09:00.430 --> 09:04.399
- Nope.
- Uh, the mechanism of red oxidation...

09:04.434 --> 09:08.036
- Nope squared.
- The release of gas bubbles indicate

09:08.071 --> 09:10.005
that there was air in Chelsea's heart.

09:10.039 --> 09:12.641
All right, that's my girl.

09:12.675 --> 09:16.478
Hell, no.
So, what caused the embolism?

09:16.512 --> 09:19.448
Uh, well, Chelsea wasn't
much of a deep-sea diver,

09:19.515 --> 09:22.251
so somebody must have injected
her with an empty syringe.

09:22.285 --> 09:24.286
To make it look like she
died of natural causes.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.554
Precisely.

09:25.588 --> 09:27.222
Why would someone murder a woman...

09:27.257 --> 09:29.291
that was already on her death bed?

09:36.549 --> 09:39.417
<i>Chelsea's lawyer
sent over a copy of her will.</i>

09:39.452 --> 09:41.253
He said she contacted
him three weeks ago

09:41.287 --> 09:43.488
to set up an appointment
to make an addendum,

09:43.523 --> 09:46.091
and then she called a few
days later and canceled.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.560
- What kind of addendum?
- She didn't tell him.

09:48.594 --> 09:51.129
He wasn't sure if she
wanted to add a bequest

09:51.164 --> 09:53.498
<i>or cut someone out of the will entirely.</i>

09:53.533 --> 09:56.535
I just talked to the maid, Polly,
and she said that a...

10:00.306 --> 10:01.606
Uh...

10:03.276 --> 10:06.144
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

10:06.179 --> 10:09.114
We're doing a software upgrade.

10:09.148 --> 10:11.650
They told me to just sit anywhere.
Am I in your way?

10:11.684 --> 10:13.685
You're kind of in someone else's chair.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.788
Oh, sorry. I didn't realize.

10:26.566 --> 10:29.535
So, anyway, Polly said Chelsea
met individually with her sons

10:29.536 --> 10:32.504
and everyone on the staff right
after she started hospice care.

10:32.538 --> 10:34.890
She said her goodbyes and told them
that she'd take care

10:34.891 --> 10:37.242
- of them after she died.
- According to the will,

10:37.276 --> 10:39.277
every person on the staff
is getting a lump sum.

10:39.312 --> 10:42.180
Holy zeros! That's more than
the pension we'll get for our 20.

10:42.215 --> 10:44.182
- For all of us combined.
- What do the sons get?

10:44.217 --> 10:46.785
A lot.
After some charitable bequests,

10:46.852 --> 10:49.120
the remainder of the estate
is divided between them.

10:49.155 --> 10:51.323
Are you thinking someone was
upset by their share of the pie?

10:51.357 --> 10:53.658
No, I think someone was so
desperate for that money,

10:53.693 --> 10:56.727
they couldn't wait to
get their hands on it.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.844
- Let me get that.
- Oh.

11:12.878 --> 11:15.413
- Here.
- Thank you.

11:15.448 --> 11:17.082
My pleasure.

11:17.116 --> 11:19.517
- Hi. Jack.
- Hello.

11:19.585 --> 11:20.752
I'm Dr. Maura Isles.

11:20.786 --> 11:23.321
I'm teaching a seminar
in forensic science.

11:24.090 --> 11:25.624
First time?

11:25.658 --> 11:28.760
I wasn't sure if there was any,
um, audiovisual, uh, system,

11:28.794 --> 11:30.562
so I just brought everything.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.232
All you need is a password
for the wireless system.

11:34.267 --> 11:37.168
- Oh.
- Do you have a laptop?

11:37.203 --> 11:38.637
Uh, yes. I do.

11:38.671 --> 11:41.172
Here we go. Thank you.

11:41.207 --> 11:42.307
All right.

11:49.248 --> 11:52.250
- There we go.
- Oh. I'm very impressed.

11:52.318 --> 11:54.269
I'm just gonna run a
quick test to make sure the

11:54.270 --> 11:56.230
electrical system has
recovered from this morning.

11:56.255 --> 11:57.822
Oh, w-why?
What happened?

11:57.857 --> 12:00.759
Some idiot teacher got fed up
with the texting and twittering

12:00.793 --> 12:02.627
and went overboard with the visuals

12:02.662 --> 12:05.897
- to try to get the students' attention.
- And did it work?

12:05.931 --> 12:11.369
Yep! You bet... for two whole minutes.
Then, um...

12:11.404 --> 12:13.872
in retrospect, a laser
show and 3-D holograms

12:13.906 --> 12:15.440
was one gigawatt too many.

12:15.508 --> 12:18.443
I just started my lecture
on mechanical engineering,

12:18.477 --> 12:20.545
and the whole building blacked out.

12:21.580 --> 12:24.149
Oh, you're... you're a teacher here.

12:24.183 --> 12:28.553
Yeah.
You thought I was the A.V. guy?

12:29.588 --> 12:31.289
What? No. No, I didn't.

12:32.425 --> 12:35.393
Yes, I totally did. I am so sorry.

12:35.461 --> 12:36.761
Don't be. Don't be.

12:36.796 --> 12:39.464
It means I'm not annoying
and pretentious... yet.

12:41.701 --> 12:44.636
Um, thank you so much for your help.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.805
Anytime.
It was fun.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.208
Hello.

12:51.210 --> 12:52.644
Break a leg.

12:56.916 --> 12:58.850
Chelsea paid her people well.

12:58.884 --> 13:01.786
The chef, the butler,
and Polly all own property

13:01.821 --> 13:03.588
and have solid credit.

13:03.622 --> 13:05.590
The chauffeur's the only one
who can't live within his means.

13:05.624 --> 13:06.925
What've we got?

13:06.959 --> 13:09.861
Uh, we got a chauffeur
with a cash-flow problem.

13:09.895 --> 13:11.329
Brad Oskoff.

13:11.364 --> 13:14.799
He has expensive tastes and 15 grand
in credit-card debt to show for it.

13:14.834 --> 13:16.668
He only pays the minimum every month,

13:16.702 --> 13:18.970
so eventually he'll drown
in compounded interest.

13:19.004 --> 13:21.573
"Eventually" is not worth killing over.
What about the kids?

13:21.607 --> 13:23.942
Larry Jr... successful businessman.

13:23.976 --> 13:25.810
Built his company from the ground up

13:25.845 --> 13:27.412
without taking a cent
of his family's money.

13:27.446 --> 13:28.713
Like father, like son.

13:28.748 --> 13:32.384
On the other hand, the younger son,
Kalter, is 28, still lives at home,

13:32.418 --> 13:34.419
and recently just got back
from his 11th stint in rehab.

13:34.487 --> 13:36.554
Well, I doubt he abstains
from the family fortune.

13:36.589 --> 13:39.991
Chelsea kept him heavily supervised.
No access to cash

13:40.025 --> 13:41.866
without the approval of
his sobriety counselor.

13:41.894 --> 13:43.328
What's his drug of choice?

13:43.362 --> 13:45.630
- Heroin.
- Well, if he's using again,

13:45.664 --> 13:47.332
he needs money, and I mean right now.

13:47.366 --> 13:49.300
The Rothsburgher mansion
must be full of stuff

13:49.335 --> 13:50.969
that a pawn-shop owner
would salivate over.

13:51.003 --> 13:52.771
Let's get a list of Chelsea's valuables

13:52.805 --> 13:55.473
from the insurance company,
see if anything's missing.

13:57.810 --> 13:58.977
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

13:59.011 --> 14:00.311
<i>Hey, Ma.</i>

14:00.346 --> 14:01.746
Ah, Ma! I... I forgot!

14:01.781 --> 14:04.215
I forgot about the doctor's
appointment. I'm sorry.

14:04.283 --> 14:07.018
- I got to reschedule.
- Jane, it'll only take an hour.

14:07.052 --> 14:08.553
Come on. Let's go. It's important.

14:08.587 --> 14:09.954
Okay, well, then maybe I'll... I'll...

14:09.989 --> 14:11.489
I'll try for a Saturday appointment.

14:11.524 --> 14:15.260
- I wrote the number down.
- All right, I'll reschedule it for you.

14:15.294 --> 14:17.629
That would be fantastic.

14:17.663 --> 14:19.264
Why are you doing this?

14:19.298 --> 14:21.332
A "thank you" would suffice.

14:21.367 --> 14:24.969
You're right. Thank you.

14:25.004 --> 14:26.004
<i>No, Ma!</i>

14:26.872 --> 14:27.872
<i>Not in front of people!</i>

14:27.907 --> 14:29.407
You're very welcome.

14:32.678 --> 14:34.612
<i>Thank you all so much.</i>

14:34.647 --> 14:36.514
<i>Thank you. Nice to meet you.</i>

14:36.549 --> 14:38.483
<i>Thanks. Thank you.</i>

14:40.786 --> 14:42.353
<i>Thank you.</i>

14:42.388 --> 14:43.521
You were great.

14:43.589 --> 14:44.956
You think so?

14:44.990 --> 14:48.693
I... I thought I completely
botched the section

14:48.727 --> 14:50.829
on the importance of
statistics and DNA matching.

14:50.896 --> 14:52.797
That has nothing to do with teaching.

14:52.832 --> 14:54.933
People just don't understand statistics.

14:54.967 --> 14:58.369
Well, I-I must say
that being in front of a class...

14:58.404 --> 14:59.537
it's, um, invigorating.

15:00.706 --> 15:04.075
It's like being a rock star...
without the screaming fans or the money.

15:05.578 --> 15:07.812
But I'm... I'm dreading
the grading part.

15:07.880 --> 15:10.849
Mm, it's the worst.
When I was a T.A.,

15:10.883 --> 15:13.685
I used to throw up before and
after I turned my grades in.

15:13.752 --> 15:15.987
Oh, what did you do to change that?

15:16.021 --> 15:19.324
It just got easier over time.
I still dread it,

15:19.391 --> 15:21.793
but I don't throw up my guts anymore,
so that's progress.

15:21.827 --> 15:25.096
I guess I was hoping
there was a way I could fix that.

15:25.130 --> 15:28.399
Probably not.
I don't think feelings can be fixed.

15:30.936 --> 15:35.006
Well, if you need any more
unhelpful advice, I'll be around.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.542
Thanks. I'm always looking
for the least-helpful advice.

15:37.576 --> 15:42.080
- Well, let me help you with this.
- Thank you.

15:42.114 --> 15:45.984
Would you...
want to get a coffee with me?

15:46.018 --> 15:48.653
- I'd love to.
- Great.

15:52.491 --> 15:54.859
Someone swipes my mom's necklace,
of course you think it's me.

15:54.894 --> 15:55.894
<i>Was it?</i>

15:55.895 --> 15:56.895
Are you crazy?

15:56.896 --> 15:59.097
I don't know people
who could move a piece like that.

15:59.131 --> 16:01.633
So that's your defense...
you wouldn't know how to unload it?

16:01.667 --> 16:04.068
- No. My defense is I didn't do it.
- How many times have you said,

16:04.103 --> 16:07.005
"it wasn't me," or, "I'm not using"?

16:07.039 --> 16:09.574
What do you think, a thousand?

16:09.608 --> 16:12.477
I'm sober 74 days.
I don't care if you believe that.

16:12.511 --> 16:14.412
You don't know anything about me.

16:14.446 --> 16:17.582
Well, you have a disease
that's hard to deal with.

16:17.616 --> 16:19.083
Most people don't think it's a disease.

16:19.118 --> 16:20.652
<i>What about your mother?</i>

16:21.654 --> 16:23.655
Was she like most people?

16:23.689 --> 16:26.057
No, she wasn't like
anybody else in the world,

16:26.125 --> 16:29.594
even after... everything,
she still believed in me.

16:29.628 --> 16:30.962
I don't know why.

16:33.098 --> 16:35.867
Was she worried about you having
access to your inheritance?

16:35.901 --> 16:40.960
She said to put it in a trust.
I can't access it till I'm sober a year.

16:40.988 --> 16:43.782
- That's not in the will.
- You think I killed my mother

16:43.850 --> 16:47.019
'cause I couldn't wait six
months to get her money?

16:47.053 --> 16:50.556
The last thing I want in the world
is my inheritance.

16:50.623 --> 16:53.559
- And you expect us to believe that?
- I'm an addict.

16:53.593 --> 16:57.829
That money will kill me,
and not one person will be surprised...

16:57.864 --> 16:59.464
least of all me.

17:02.135 --> 17:03.835
<i>Thank you for checking.</i>

17:06.638 --> 17:09.107
Insurance company confirms that
the diamonds in the necklace

17:09.142 --> 17:11.009
were individually
marked with an I.D. code.

17:11.044 --> 17:13.412
<i>So no breaking
it down to sell the stones.</i>

17:13.479 --> 17:14.813
And it looks like Kalter was right.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.616
- Nobody tried to pawn it.
- Well, not worth the hassle.

17:17.684 --> 17:19.718
The insurance company would
spend hundreds of man hours

17:19.752 --> 17:22.186
tracking it down.
The pawn-shop owner would end up

17:22.255 --> 17:23.755
on the wrong side of a
stolen-property charge.

17:23.790 --> 17:24.790
Hmm.

17:26.858 --> 17:28.160
Detective Korsak.

17:30.029 --> 17:35.234
I bet you were shocked
and appalled, indeed.

17:35.268 --> 17:37.603
Well, thank you very much.

17:37.637 --> 17:40.239
One of the auction houses.
They took the necklace at consignment.

17:40.273 --> 17:42.040
They're faxing over a still
from the security video

17:42.075 --> 17:45.252
- of the guy that brought it in.
- Shocked and appalled?

17:45.303 --> 17:48.212
Yeah, claimed they had no idea
that stolen property was there

17:48.302 --> 17:51.408
- at such a prestigious establishment.
- You buy that?

17:51.519 --> 17:55.447
Not for a second, but I am
trying to be less cynical.

17:55.515 --> 17:56.515
Mm.

17:57.550 --> 17:59.451
<i>That's Larry Rothsburgher.</i>

17:59.519 --> 18:01.453
Now, that is the kind of stuff

18:01.487 --> 18:03.989
that makes it hard for
me not to be cynical.

18:09.607 --> 18:12.775
My mother asked me to sell
the necklace months ago.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.243
I just forgot. But...

18:14.311 --> 18:16.879
I'm glad you guys called me in
so I could help sort it out.

18:16.914 --> 18:20.016
Well, we're glad you're glad,
'cause there's just a few other things

18:20.050 --> 18:22.351
- we need your help with.
- Yeah, anything.

18:22.386 --> 18:23.719
We were wondering why a guy

18:23.754 --> 18:25.354
who built his business
with his own money...

18:25.389 --> 18:26.956
Yeah, never took a dime
of the family's money.

18:26.990 --> 18:28.691
Self-made man, just like my dad.

18:28.759 --> 18:30.439
Right, yeah, you...
you've said that a lot.

18:30.461 --> 18:32.295
Actually, I've checked...
you've... you've said that

18:32.329 --> 18:33.769
in every interview you've ever done.

18:33.797 --> 18:35.765
And we looked into
your company's finances,

18:35.799 --> 18:39.035
and selling that necklace
would buy you a few weeks, at best.

18:39.069 --> 18:41.070
Well, if you have something to say...

18:41.105 --> 18:43.673
- say it.
- Your company's crashing.

18:43.740 --> 18:46.309
Your reputation as a businessman
is going down with it.

18:46.343 --> 18:48.444
Getting that inheritance
would stop that.

18:48.512 --> 18:50.012
Is that clear enough for you?

18:50.047 --> 18:52.648
I didn't kill my mother.
I would never hurt her.

18:52.716 --> 18:54.984
Where were you the night she died?

18:56.053 --> 18:59.722
I was... at home.
My wife was out of town, so...

18:59.756 --> 19:01.524
I was by myself.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.759
- Doing what?
- Reading.

19:03.794 --> 19:06.662
- Reading what?
- Proust.

19:06.697 --> 19:08.631
I didn't think anyone still read Proust.

19:08.665 --> 19:10.867
Which one of Proust's many
books were you reading?

19:10.901 --> 19:14.370
- Look, I'm telling you the truth.
- You have motive, access,

19:14.438 --> 19:18.541
and your alibi is not only flimsy,
it's kind of pretentious.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.878
And the only way we can help you
is if you're honest with us.

19:22.946 --> 19:24.780
I want to talk to my lawyer.

19:34.691 --> 19:37.793
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, there you are.

19:37.861 --> 19:40.963
Listen, you have to take
folic acid as soon as possible.

19:40.998 --> 19:42.632
Good to know.

19:42.666 --> 19:45.368
Uh, were you able to reschedule
my doctor's appointment?

19:45.402 --> 19:46.836
Well, I tried,

19:46.870 --> 19:49.839
but if you don't cancel at
least 24 hours ahead of time,

19:49.907 --> 19:53.075
they charge you,
so I just went to the appointment.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.612
You...
went to my doctor's appointment?

19:56.680 --> 19:58.147
<i>For my pregnancy?</i>

19:58.182 --> 19:59.649
Yeah, I told them I'm your mother.

19:59.683 --> 20:02.952
I mean, I didn't pretend to be you.
I'm not some kind of crazy person.

20:02.986 --> 20:05.988
What did you talk about
at my doctor's appointment?

20:06.023 --> 20:08.457
Well, I asked them if
I could be your midwife.

20:08.492 --> 20:12.094
Ma!
You're not going to deliver my baby!

20:12.129 --> 20:15.164
It's not gonna be a home birth.
We could go to the hospital.

20:15.199 --> 20:18.501
There's no "we"!
This is not a "we"! The... wha...

20:18.535 --> 20:19.969
You know what?

20:20.003 --> 20:23.139
I can get my own vitamins.
And I can talk to my own doctor.

20:23.174 --> 20:25.660
And I can go to my own appointment.

20:26.843 --> 20:29.579
I was just trying to help you.

20:30.180 --> 20:31.647
Well, you're not being helpful.

20:31.682 --> 20:34.417
You're being invasive,
and I need you to stop.

20:37.187 --> 20:38.955
Geez. Ma.

20:40.557 --> 20:44.093
<i>Five sigma's fun, but
forensics solves crimes.</i>

20:44.127 --> 20:45.695
Ah, okay.

20:45.729 --> 20:48.664
Five-sigma's fun, but
forensics solves crimes.

20:48.699 --> 20:51.033
Chin up.
Five sigma's...

20:51.068 --> 20:54.670
You would not believe what my moth...
What are you doing?

20:54.705 --> 20:58.140
89, 90, 91.
I'm just, um...

20:58.175 --> 21:00.576
I'm doing my usual 100 brushes a day.

21:00.644 --> 21:02.411
What does it look like I'm doing?

21:02.479 --> 21:04.847
It looks like you were
singing into your hairbrush

21:04.881 --> 21:07.116
and practicing for your
summer-camp talent show.

21:07.150 --> 21:08.684
That's absurd.

21:08.719 --> 21:10.753
The camps I went to
never had talent shows.

21:10.787 --> 21:12.188
What's that?

21:13.523 --> 21:18.794
"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic"...
these are the worst lyrics ever.

21:18.829 --> 21:22.098
I'm practicing for my next lecture.

21:22.132 --> 21:25.568
- Yeah, how did it go today?
- It went well...

21:25.602 --> 21:26.669
Too well.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.038
- What happened?
- Nothing. Um...

21:29.072 --> 21:32.908
It's just that now there are
expectations that I'm gifted as a teacher,

21:32.943 --> 21:36.512
and I don't exactly know
what I did for anyone to think that.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.981
So if someone, or anyone,
comes to my next lecture

21:39.049 --> 21:41.684
and they're disappointed,
maybe they won't like me.

21:41.718 --> 21:47.523
- And maybe I don't want them to anyway.
- Okay. Um...

21:47.557 --> 21:50.026
Someone paid you a compliment

21:50.060 --> 21:53.663
that you're not really
handling well beca...

21:53.697 --> 21:56.465
- You met a guy!
- Ohh.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.533
And you like him!

21:57.567 --> 22:00.469
- Who is he?!
- His name is Jack Armstrong.

22:00.504 --> 22:01.570
Jack Armstrong.

22:01.605 --> 22:03.773
- He's a professor.
- A professor.

22:03.807 --> 22:05.474
He knows how to use tools.

22:05.542 --> 22:08.911
He's smart, he's funny,
and he may actually be a grown-up.

22:08.945 --> 22:10.713
Seriously?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.282
And when I look at him,
I picture us having sex,

22:13.317 --> 22:16.052
- if you get my drift.
- It'd be impossible not to.

22:16.086 --> 22:18.521
Wh... but, okay, so what?
Why are you so upset?

22:18.555 --> 22:20.723
Because...

22:20.757 --> 22:23.526
because I know that it
just won't work between us.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.095
- There's just no way.
- He's married?

22:26.129 --> 22:28.064
Nope. Divorced, six years.
Has a daughter.

22:28.098 --> 22:31.567
- He's about to be deported?
- Born and raised in Michigan.

22:31.601 --> 22:34.170
Department rivalry, like a
jets/sharks kind of thing? it's...

22:34.237 --> 22:37.173
Jane, it's not gonna work
because it... it just can't.

22:37.207 --> 22:40.943
Because every time I feel this
way about someone, it ends badly.

22:41.011 --> 22:43.679
Okay, well, hang on a second.
I mean, uh...

22:43.747 --> 22:47.650
I've never seen you like this.
You're... you're swooning.

22:47.684 --> 22:51.654
- To swoon is to faint from emotion.
- I know! But I don't have a word

22:51.688 --> 22:54.824
for singing in a sexy
voice into your hairbrush.

22:56.626 --> 22:59.862
I mean, come on.
Give the guy a chance, okay?

22:59.896 --> 23:02.264
It's Frankie. I gotta go.

23:02.299 --> 23:05.901
Here.
Okay, and we're sexy...

23:05.936 --> 23:09.972
- sexy, sexy...
- Go away.

23:10.006 --> 23:12.274
<i>... sexy.</i>

23:16.380 --> 23:18.714
Hi, Polly. What can we do for you?

23:18.749 --> 23:21.217
I heard Mr. Larry's being held here...

23:21.251 --> 23:24.220
that you suspect him
in his mother's murder?

23:24.254 --> 23:27.256
Uh...
Well, I'm... I'm sorry,

23:27.290 --> 23:30.025
but we can't comment on
an ongoing investigation.

23:30.060 --> 23:34.597
But you're making a mistake!
He couldn't have hurt his mother.

23:34.631 --> 23:36.866
When he found out she died,

23:36.933 --> 23:40.236
he was a wreck...
completely heartbroken.

23:41.405 --> 23:45.808
I've known him most of his life.
He's a good man.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.277
Well, sometimes good
people do bad things, Polly.

23:48.311 --> 23:49.812
I'm... I'm very sorry.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.747
His lawyers will let
you know how to help.

23:51.782 --> 23:54.049
Usually, during the trial
phase, friends and family...

23:54.117 --> 23:58.687
No, you're not listening!
I can prove that he's innocent.

23:58.722 --> 24:02.496
- You can?
- Larry did not murder his mother.

24:02.531 --> 24:04.920
I did!

24:10.798 --> 24:14.134
I understand that Polly's confession
was emotionally charged,

24:14.168 --> 24:16.937
but her claim that she
helped Chelsea commit suicide

24:16.971 --> 24:20.040
by giving her a fatal dose of
morphine is... patently false.

24:20.074 --> 24:22.576
Chelsea Rothsburgher did not
die of an overdose of morphine.

24:22.610 --> 24:24.644
Well, she gave us a
pretty detailed confession.

24:24.679 --> 24:26.847
I mean, she told us how
they came up with the plan,

24:26.881 --> 24:29.015
how they hoarded
morphine, picked the day.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.684
Why would she admit
it if it wasn't true?

24:30.718 --> 24:32.285
Well, she could be protecting Larry.

24:32.320 --> 24:34.888
She could be a pathological liar
with narcissistic tendencies.

24:34.922 --> 24:36.690
She could be having a psychotic break.

24:38.726 --> 24:40.894
Or she could be telling the truth.

24:42.163 --> 24:45.632
- Yep. She's telling the truth.
- What just happened?

24:45.666 --> 24:47.267
Because a second ago, she
was a pathological liar.

24:47.301 --> 24:49.703
Well, I-I tested Chelsea's saline bag,

24:49.770 --> 24:53.106
and the contents are a mixture
of saline and liquid morphine.

24:53.141 --> 24:55.275
So Polly did kill Chelsea,
just like she said.

24:55.309 --> 24:57.711
<i>Her story is true, but
she didn't murder Chelsea.</i>

24:57.745 --> 25:00.614
By the time that Polly injected
the morphine in the saline bag,

25:01.248 --> 25:03.616
- Chelsea was already dead.
- Come again?

25:03.650 --> 25:05.284
If Chelsea's heart had been pumping,

25:05.319 --> 25:08.888
the morphine would have been drawn
into the blood flow and killed her.

25:08.922 --> 25:12.358
- Except that someone got to her first.
- Indeed.

25:13.827 --> 25:15.962
Well, she's guilty of
attempted murder, at least.

25:15.996 --> 25:17.663
Mnh-mnh. The law is very clear.

25:17.698 --> 25:19.866
The attempted murder
of a dead body is not a crime.

25:21.735 --> 25:24.437
So, we're saying that
two separate people

25:24.471 --> 25:27.473
both just happened to try
to murder the same person

25:27.508 --> 25:30.309
- on the same night?
- What you think?

25:30.344 --> 25:31.911
No such thing as a coincidence.

25:31.945 --> 25:36.132
Maybe Polly knew what Larry
Jr. did and thought she could

25:36.133 --> 25:40.319
protect him by injecting the
morphine and taking the fall.

25:40.354 --> 25:41.687
That would be a good theory,

25:41.755 --> 25:43.623
but I just met with
Larry Jr. and his lawyer,

25:43.657 --> 25:45.858
and I might have implied
that our case is airtight

25:45.893 --> 25:48.394
and that Larry Jr. is two
steps away from death row.

25:48.428 --> 25:50.329
Massachusetts doesn't
have the death penalty.

25:50.364 --> 25:51.964
My point was made.

25:51.999 --> 25:54.734
Larry admitted he lied about his
alibi to protect his marriage.

25:54.768 --> 25:56.402
Oh, he was with another woman.

25:56.436 --> 25:58.371
He was being intimate
with two other women...

25:58.405 --> 26:01.007
and one man... at the same time.

26:01.041 --> 26:04.727
And unfortunately, there's video...
for our eyes only.

26:04.742 --> 26:07.174
Did I say "ours"?
I meant yours.

26:09.983 --> 26:11.784
Oh, come on, guys. Don't do this to me.

26:11.819 --> 26:13.586
It's a chain-of-command
thing, bud.

26:13.620 --> 26:15.021
I'm sorry. Our hands are tied.

26:22.963 --> 26:24.997
Hey, um...

26:25.065 --> 26:27.500
you remember the guy
that sat there yesterday?

26:27.534 --> 26:30.269
- Yeah.
- Well, the desk, the chair...

26:30.304 --> 26:32.772
it's just kind of become a thing.

26:32.806 --> 26:36.475
You know, we need to do
something to de-thingify it.

26:36.510 --> 26:37.910
You know what I mean?

26:37.945 --> 26:40.479
Maybe if one of us, you
know, sat there sometimes,

26:40.514 --> 26:43.015
- it wouldn't seem so empty.
- It's a great idea.

26:43.050 --> 26:44.684
We should definitely do that.

26:44.718 --> 26:46.919
I mean, uh, Maura needs me now, so...

26:46.987 --> 26:49.388
Yeah, I got to... be somewhere.

26:54.761 --> 26:57.897
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:57.965 --> 26:59.832
Are you looking for something?

26:59.867 --> 27:02.768
No, I'm... I'm hiding
from an empty chair.

27:02.803 --> 27:04.971
Literally or philosophically?

27:05.005 --> 27:06.806
Both, I think. What are you doing?

27:06.840 --> 27:09.709
The final test results
came back on the saline bag.

27:09.743 --> 27:12.478
There was enough morphine
in there to end her life

27:12.512 --> 27:15.448
peacefully and painlessly.

27:15.515 --> 27:16.883
Is there any chance
that the air embolism

27:16.917 --> 27:18.684
could have killed Chelsea
when she was sleeping?

27:18.719 --> 27:22.388
No, she would have been wide awake
and felt every excruciating moment.

27:22.456 --> 27:24.924
It's just tragic... the
brutal irony of her death.

27:24.958 --> 27:28.494
- How do you mean?
- Well, she planned on dying one way,

27:28.528 --> 27:30.429
and then what happened was the
exact opposite of what she wanted.

27:30.497 --> 27:32.498
Yeah.

27:32.532 --> 27:33.733
Dr. Isles?

27:33.800 --> 27:34.901
- Yes.
- Hi.

27:38.071 --> 27:40.773
- Could you sign here, please?
- Yes.

27:44.945 --> 27:46.512
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:47.714 --> 27:51.751
He wrote the card in Latin.
Barf.

27:55.088 --> 27:56.980
What kind of flowers are these?

27:57.076 --> 28:00.524
It's actually a tree.
And over the next two weeks

28:00.559 --> 28:03.561
the roots are gonna get so
strong that they're gonna break

28:03.562 --> 28:06.599
the ceramic pot onless I re-plant
it with enough room to grow.

28:06.633 --> 28:10.736
A latin card and a metaphor plant?
He could be your soul mate.

28:11.638 --> 28:14.807
- Or your clone.
- The truth is, I have been doing

28:14.841 --> 28:16.876
a field study on dating
for over 10 years,

28:16.944 --> 28:18.945
and I can no longer ignore the results.

28:18.979 --> 28:21.714
There is no Mr. Right
out there for me.

28:21.748 --> 28:23.716
Maura. Come on.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.618
All right, you can't
look at relationships

28:25.652 --> 28:27.420
like they're scientific experiments.

28:27.454 --> 28:30.756
The guy who I had
the most amazing sexual chemistry with?

28:30.824 --> 28:33.125
- A face licker.
- Yeah.

28:33.193 --> 28:36.729
And the next guy who I had feelings for
ended up dead,

28:36.763 --> 28:39.498
- and I was framed for his murder.
- To be fair...

28:39.533 --> 28:41.500
getting murdered was not his fault.

28:41.535 --> 28:44.937
For all we know, he... he could
have been a wonderful boyfriend.

28:44.972 --> 28:48.007
And then the guy who said that
he really wanted my body...

28:48.041 --> 28:50.876
He meant it literally,
because he was a serial killer

28:50.944 --> 28:53.546
who made sculptures out
of dead women's bodies.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.147
Yes, that was unfortunate.

28:56.516 --> 29:01.954
But... would a serial killer
send you a romantic metaphor plant?

29:01.989 --> 29:05.057
I'm not sure.
The nerium oleander has two meanings.

29:05.092 --> 29:06.959
It's rare and beautiful and also deadly.

29:07.027 --> 29:08.728
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

29:08.762 --> 29:10.796
God, you'd think a guy
would brush up on his botany

29:10.864 --> 29:13.165
before sending you a
tree with mixed messages.

29:13.233 --> 29:16.002
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

29:16.036 --> 29:18.404
Honey.
I'm sorry.

29:18.438 --> 29:21.707
I know you're iffy about trusting
your gut when it comes to men,

29:21.742 --> 29:23.542
but your professional
instincts are spot on,

29:23.577 --> 29:26.512
and I think what you said about
the irony about Chelsea's death,

29:26.580 --> 29:28.614
that could actually be
the key to this case.

29:37.991 --> 29:41.961
- That bad?
- I've seen things I can't unsee.

29:43.563 --> 29:46.532
- You okay?
- Larry's not our guy, and...

29:46.566 --> 29:48.567
let's not talk about it ever again.

29:48.602 --> 29:50.501
It's probably for the best.

29:50.543 --> 29:53.539
So Maura told me that an
air embolism is excruciating

29:53.573 --> 29:55.141
and that Chelsea probably woke up

29:55.175 --> 29:57.710
and actually felt her heart
exploding in her chest.

29:57.744 --> 29:59.545
Note to self... don't go that way.

29:59.579 --> 30:01.820
I think we've been looking
at this case in the wrong way.

30:01.848 --> 30:03.248
It's not about millions of dollars.

30:03.250 --> 30:04.984
The motive is more personal than that.

30:05.018 --> 30:07.620
- What do you mean?
- I think that someone found out

30:07.687 --> 30:09.855
about Chelsea's plan for
assisted suicide, and they didn't

30:09.856 --> 30:12.024
want her to die peacefully.
They wanted her to suffer.

30:12.092 --> 30:13.626
- Somebody hated her.
- Yeah.

30:13.660 --> 30:16.161
So all we have to do is figure out who.

30:24.663 --> 30:25.929
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:25.997 --> 30:28.065
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

30:28.099 --> 30:29.933
Please, have a seat.

30:38.877 --> 30:42.579
- I think it's best to be up front.
- Damn.

30:42.647 --> 30:44.715
I... haven't finished yet.

30:44.749 --> 30:46.884
You were gonna say
you're not that into me.

30:46.918 --> 30:50.788
- I'm sorry.
- I really thought we had chemistry.

30:50.855 --> 30:52.923
It seemed like you thought so, too.

30:52.957 --> 30:56.193
We do. I-I just think that's...
that's actually the problem.

30:56.227 --> 30:58.195
You're going with
"it's not you. It's me"?

30:58.229 --> 31:01.899
- Oh, no, it's you. Very much you.
- That's direct.

31:01.933 --> 31:04.802
For some reason, the men
that I am attracted to

31:04.836 --> 31:08.038
all have serious neurological
and biological disorders.

31:08.073 --> 31:11.993
And since I'm wildly attracted
to you, I strongly suggest that

31:11.994 --> 31:15.913
you get a full physical and
psychological checkup immediately.

31:15.947 --> 31:18.148
And don't be afraid of a second opinion

31:18.183 --> 31:21.118
because a misdiagnosis
would cost you valuable time.

31:21.186 --> 31:24.305
- You're wildly attracted to me?
- I just told you that you

31:24.306 --> 31:26.557
might be severely ill,
and that's all you heard?

31:26.591 --> 31:27.958
Are you sure about this, Maura?

31:27.992 --> 31:29.727
Do you really want
to live alone in fear,

31:29.794 --> 31:32.529
instead of with somebody
who knows what it's like to be scared?

31:32.564 --> 31:34.031
No.

31:34.065 --> 31:37.735
Okay, then, so we're both terrified.

31:37.769 --> 31:41.739
But the only thing that scares
me more than getting hurt is...

31:41.773 --> 31:43.540
never falling in love again.

31:45.977 --> 31:48.178
It only needs to work out once, right?

31:48.246 --> 31:50.881
That's what my best
friend's mother always says.

31:50.915 --> 31:54.518
- Your friend's mom is a very wise woman.
- Well, she also says

31:54.552 --> 31:56.220
you have to kiss a lot of
frogs to find your prince.

31:56.287 --> 32:00.124
Factually incorrect on many levels,
but I still like the sentiment.

32:00.158 --> 32:04.628
- That's exactly what I said!
- So, what do you think?

32:04.696 --> 32:07.865
I'm not an amphibian with
unlikely royal ancestry,

32:07.899 --> 32:11.568
but are you willing to
take a chance on me anyway?

32:13.004 --> 32:14.805
Did Polly have any idea

32:14.839 --> 32:16.440
who else might have known
about her plan to kill Chelsea?

32:16.474 --> 32:18.475
Well, she swears they
kept it absolutely secret.

32:18.510 --> 32:20.477
But they talked about
the plan for three weeks.

32:20.512 --> 32:21.779
Why so long?

32:21.813 --> 32:23.898
Chelsea wanted every detail
to be perfect, from the

32:23.899 --> 32:25.983
amount of morphine to the wine
she had with her last meal.

32:26.017 --> 32:28.085
That's a lot of talk in
a house full of people.

32:28.119 --> 32:30.020
And the only visitors
she had were her sons.

32:30.088 --> 32:32.523
So her kids and the household
staff are the only people

32:32.557 --> 32:34.425
who could have overheard
the suicide plan.

32:34.492 --> 32:36.727
Yeah. I'll have Frankie
do a deep background check,

32:36.761 --> 32:38.896
try and figure out who
wanted to see her suffer.

32:45.003 --> 32:46.737
Ma, that's not what I ordered.

32:48.239 --> 32:50.040
I mean, thank you.

32:50.074 --> 32:52.676
And would you please
sit with me while I eat?

32:55.613 --> 32:58.916
Okay.
I'm sorry that I hurt your feelings.

32:58.983 --> 33:00.918
And we can talk about my pregnancy.

33:00.952 --> 33:04.788
It's just... will you please just...
be respectful of my boundaries?

33:04.856 --> 33:07.658
You think this is about
my boundary problems?

33:07.692 --> 33:09.960
You don't have any boundaries, either.

33:09.994 --> 33:13.564
You've got 10-foot walls made of steel.

33:13.631 --> 33:15.852
And I know why you built them...

33:15.935 --> 33:20.270
because you watched me make the
mistake of being completely dependent.

33:20.305 --> 33:22.639
So to avoid the same fate,

33:22.674 --> 33:26.109
you chose never to depend on anyone.

33:26.144 --> 33:29.713
But now you have to decide

33:29.747 --> 33:33.250
whether those 10-foot
walls are working for you.

33:33.284 --> 33:35.719
Or are they just leftovers

33:35.753 --> 33:39.756
from trying so hard not to be me?

33:40.758 --> 33:44.561
I'm sorry I went to your
doctor's appointment.

33:44.596 --> 33:47.631
I should have asked you first.

33:49.167 --> 33:51.869
Who are you, and what have
you done with my mother?

33:51.903 --> 33:54.037
Eat your chicken.

33:59.911 --> 34:00.944
<i>What'd you find?</i>

34:00.979 --> 34:02.613
You remember Brad Oskoff?

34:02.647 --> 34:05.949
Yeah, the, uh, handyman chauffeur
with the expensive tastes?

34:05.984 --> 34:07.880
His mother, Katrina Oskoff,

34:07.922 --> 34:11.989
worked at the Rothsburgher
mansion from 1976 to 1979,

34:12.023 --> 34:13.190
the year Brad was born.

34:13.224 --> 34:16.960
After that, Katrina lived in a house
bought by the Rothsburgher corporation.

34:16.995 --> 34:19.696
She died of liver disease
when Brad was 16 years old.

34:19.731 --> 34:21.632
That's the year he started
working for the family.

34:21.666 --> 34:24.001
What was that you said
about coincidences?

34:24.034 --> 34:27.905
- No such thing.
- There's definitely a resemblance.

34:32.023 --> 34:35.312
You know, if I was a
Rothsburgher by blood

34:35.346 --> 34:37.947
but had to work as the help,
I'd be pretty pissed off, too.

34:42.387 --> 34:45.389
Do you think Brad has been
stewing on it all this time?

34:45.422 --> 34:48.190
- Jane.
- Hmm?

34:49.159 --> 34:51.661
Yeah. I di...

34:53.264 --> 34:55.966
You guys, what are we gonna
do about Frost's chair?

34:57.635 --> 35:00.070
I think...

35:00.104 --> 35:02.773
You were right before. We should use it.

35:02.807 --> 35:06.944
- Then what?
- Only one way to find out.

35:17.188 --> 35:20.223
I got to say...

35:20.291 --> 35:23.226
I know he's in my
thoughts, he's in my heart,

35:23.261 --> 35:25.329
and some people would
say he's in this room,

35:25.396 --> 35:30.934
but Detective Barry Frost
isn't sitting here.

35:30.969 --> 35:32.903
Yeah, it's just a chair.

35:34.205 --> 35:35.872
A chair.

35:41.736 --> 35:43.971
All right, thanks.

35:44.005 --> 35:46.257
Maura says that the syringe
used to inject an air bubble into

35:46.258 --> 35:48.509
Chelsea's vein would be completely
empty. There would be no residue.

35:48.543 --> 35:51.112
Brad's too smart to throw the
murder weapon away at the house.

35:51.146 --> 35:53.013
Where did he say he was
the night Chelsea died?

35:53.081 --> 35:56.650
At the movies. A theater
attendant saw him before and after.

35:56.685 --> 35:59.120
So that leaves 2 hours and 40 minutes.

35:59.154 --> 36:01.155
All right, I'll check the
trash cans and dumpsters

36:01.189 --> 36:02.723
on his route and at the movie theater.

36:02.791 --> 36:05.059
He probably dropped the
syringe somewhere along the way.

36:05.093 --> 36:06.260
Yeah.

36:14.002 --> 36:15.836
<i>The DNA on the cylinder is yours.</i>

36:15.870 --> 36:18.205
Probably got there when you
took the cap off with your teeth.

36:18.239 --> 36:21.375
- People make that mistake a lot.
- Using a syringe is not a crime.

36:21.443 --> 36:24.378
We also found some DNA at the
nose of it. It's a small sample.

36:24.412 --> 36:27.348
We had to send it away for
a specialized test, but we're

36:27.349 --> 36:30.284
confident it's gonna come back
testing positive for Chelsea's DNA.

36:30.318 --> 36:33.387
Until then, you have the opportunity
to give us your side of the story,

36:33.421 --> 36:35.122
make a better deal with the D.A.

36:36.658 --> 36:39.426
Not feeling chatty?

36:39.461 --> 36:42.129
All right, we'll go first.

36:42.564 --> 36:44.865
Yeah, it took us a while
to see the resemblance.

36:44.899 --> 36:47.301
<i>Same jaw. Same eyes.</i>

36:48.770 --> 36:50.571
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:50.605 --> 36:52.906
When Chelsea said she
would give you a lump sum

36:52.941 --> 36:55.743
just like the rest of the
staff, was that the last straw?

36:55.810 --> 36:57.444
I didn't care about that.

36:57.479 --> 36:59.580
I think you should.
You're Larry Rothsburgher's son.

36:59.647 --> 37:01.481
Shut up!

37:04.819 --> 37:06.420
You didn't know, did you?

37:15.463 --> 37:17.931
She wanted forgiveness.

37:21.803 --> 37:24.905
She was sorry for not having
welcomed me into the family

37:24.939 --> 37:26.607
like she should have.

37:26.641 --> 37:29.643
She just couldn't get over
the fact that her husband

37:29.677 --> 37:32.141
had an affair... with my mom.

37:32.176 --> 37:34.314
So she tried to give you
money, make things right?

37:34.382 --> 37:36.316
I didn't get a chance to know my dad

37:36.384 --> 37:38.652
when he was alive because
it was too hard for her.

37:38.686 --> 37:42.656
Then she tried to make it
right with a pile of money.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.958
How did you know she
was gonna commit suicide?

37:44.993 --> 37:47.928
Because I saw Polly hiding
bottles of liquid morphine.

37:47.962 --> 37:52.299
And the idea of her just...

37:52.333 --> 37:55.402
- just getting to go to sleep...
- Made you angry.

37:55.437 --> 37:56.904
<i>She decided my life was dirt.</i>

37:56.938 --> 38:00.608
Why should she get to
choose an easy death?

38:11.486 --> 38:13.787
She kept trying to breathe.

38:13.855 --> 38:18.892
It only took three or four minutes,
but it felt like a year.

38:25.366 --> 38:28.661
Well, she suffered.
You got what you wanted.

38:28.696 --> 38:30.788
Why doesn't that make you happy?

38:49.924 --> 38:53.360
Every time I close my eyes...

38:53.394 --> 38:55.996
I see her face staring at me.

38:56.030 --> 39:00.868
And I...
and... and I...

39:04.138 --> 39:06.540
I think she was trying to forgive me.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.060
I just want to go back
to the day that she told me

39:11.155 --> 39:16.102
the truth and say,
"it's okay. It's okay."

39:18.653 --> 39:22.122
And just say, "I forgive you."

39:28.897 --> 39:32.032
And it's completely normal
to be like a cat in heat

39:32.100 --> 39:34.167
during your second trimester.

39:34.202 --> 39:36.603
Really? I thought that was a myth.

39:36.671 --> 39:39.606
Mm, it's not, so beware
of pregnancy goggles.

39:40.608 --> 39:43.844
- You mean like beer goggles?
- Mm.

39:43.878 --> 39:46.446
Worse.
Stick to these rules...

39:46.514 --> 39:48.615
no fanny packs, no cellphone holsters,

39:48.650 --> 39:52.619
and no sandals with black socks.

39:52.654 --> 39:56.423
Well, that's just good
rules for life in general.

39:56.457 --> 39:57.958
Mm.

39:57.992 --> 40:00.494
You can't imagine how many
times I used to ask your father

40:00.528 --> 40:02.529
to pull the car over
so we could get it on.

40:02.564 --> 40:04.932
No, no!
No, no! You see?

40:04.999 --> 40:09.836
That boundary... you just
blew right past it. It...

40:09.871 --> 40:13.073
So it's okay to talk
about sex with strangers,

40:13.107 --> 40:17.110
- but not your father and your boss?
- Write that down.

40:18.913 --> 40:21.448
She took the Triumph on her date?

40:21.482 --> 40:24.785
Yeah, apparently he's
a fan of the sidecar.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.555
Hi.

40:28.590 --> 40:30.657
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:35.096 --> 40:36.196
That's it?

40:37.465 --> 40:39.733
We're working on our boundaries.

40:39.767 --> 40:41.602
<i>Yes, apparently,</i>

40:41.636 --> 40:45.105
it's better if we let
you volunteer things.

40:45.139 --> 40:47.574
Well, he didn't try to kill me.

40:47.609 --> 40:48.942
- Mm!
- Yay!

40:48.977 --> 40:51.244
That's a good sign.

40:51.279 --> 40:52.746
What are you drinking?

40:52.780 --> 40:54.648
- Grapefruit lucys.
- Grapefruit ricky.

40:54.716 --> 40:56.783
It's a grapefruit ricky
but without the ricky.

40:56.818 --> 40:57.884
It's just grapefruit.

40:57.919 --> 40:59.720
May I have one, please?

40:59.754 --> 41:01.888
But a real one, not the one
that we're making Jane drink.

41:01.923 --> 41:03.023
Sure.

41:04.058 --> 41:09.029
So, tell me, was the governor
upset with Jane's phone prank?

41:09.063 --> 41:11.164
Well, according to the press conference,

41:11.199 --> 41:14.790
he was very glad that he pushed
for further investigation.

41:14.825 --> 41:19.873
- So apparently not.
- Ooh. So this is a cause for celebration.

41:19.941 --> 41:22.876
Why, 'cause we solved the case
but we didn't get the credit?

41:22.910 --> 41:24.851
No, because you didn't get fired

41:24.852 --> 41:28.181
and Maura's pretty sure
she's not dating a serial killer.

41:28.516 --> 41:30.584
- Whoo-hoo!
- Hooray!

41:30.618 --> 41:33.082
- Hooray!
- Yippie!

41:34.613 --> 41:37.224
- Give me one sip.
- No!
