WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.575
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.878 --> 00:05.460
- He just killed a guy.
- Only because I asked him to.

00:05.631 --> 00:07.167
- It doesn't mean
he's not gonna learn to like it.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.297
- You actually thought
I might kill her.

00:09.384 --> 00:11.420
That my family's legacy
does not control me.

00:11.595 --> 00:13.756
- The serial killer has a tattoo.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.671
One of their members works
at the Gun & Rose Diner.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.261
- And you think they're just going to talk
to you because you have the tattoo now?

00:18.435 --> 00:19.936
- You don't get the tat
unless you're Troubled.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.388
- Can you control it?

00:21.563 --> 00:23.895
- One touch, and you're doubled over
on the floor.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.681
You don't feel it.

00:35.244 --> 00:37.326
- Agent Howard?
- You have to stop.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.073
- Stop what?
- Remembering.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.292
(background chatter)

01:18.370 --> 01:19.655
(sighs)

01:57.075 --> 01:59.111
- Who's there?

02:06.168 --> 02:07.829
(shouting, thud)

02:08.003 --> 02:10.995
(screaming)

02:14.676 --> 02:16.257
- Mr. Crocker,

02:16.428 --> 02:19.966
do you or do you not own
the vehicle in question?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.222
- Does anybody
really own anything, sir?

02:22.392 --> 02:25.759
I mean, I like to think that my truck and |
sort of found each other.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.314
For instance, do you own that gavel?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.393
Does Lynette own that argyle sweater,

02:30.567 --> 02:32.853
or does it own her?
(scattered laughs)

02:33.028 --> 02:35.144
- And how will you be paying
for your parking citations?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.687
- That's the thing, your Honour.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.231
See, l was ticketed for parking
off-road at Doble's Beach,

02:39.409 --> 02:41.570
but above mean-high tide,
that's private property.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.903
Now, was I trespassing? Perhaps.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.034
But I was cited for...

02:46.124 --> 02:47.239
Lyneﬁe?

02:47.376 --> 02:48.957
- Um...

02:50.295 --> 02:52.206
"Parking in a no-parking zone."

02:52.297 --> 02:53.753
- Parking.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.923
And can't get a parking ticket
on private property.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.384
- Well, then I'll dismiss the tickets.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.969
- Thank you, your Honour.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.089
- That way, you can drive
to the State Liquor Board

03:03.266 --> 03:06.884
and, uh, pay off
the $5,000 liquor license

03:07.062 --> 03:08.552
for the Grey Gull.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.184
OthenNise, you'll be shut down
at 10 tonight.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.065
It's amazing what turns up
when you put a name in the system.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.368
- Today is looking up.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.284
What the hell's this?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.834
Lady”.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.079
I don't suppose you saw
who did this and then...

03:33.839 --> 03:36.080
And then confiscated his knife?

03:37.134 --> 03:38.294
Hey!

03:41.513 --> 03:43.128
What the hell did I ever do to you?

03:44.224 --> 03:45.555
You are gonna regret this.

03:45.726 --> 03:49.139
Tommy, hey, hey, look, I need you
to be a cop right now, 'cause she...

03:50.814 --> 03:53.271
No, no, no, no, look,
this chick was right here, okay?

03:53.358 --> 03:56.896
She... like, tall,
mental, kind of hot.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.312
- You really need to develop
a radar for the crazies, my man.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.193
- No, look, I'm telling you,
she was here, okay?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.153
- Good luck with that.
(laughs)

04:04.244 --> 04:06.826
- Oh, come on, you're not even
gonna take a statement?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.949
Nothing?
- Oh, boy.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.662
- So you saw the Colorado Kid,
a creepy barn,

04:12.753 --> 04:14.084
and your old boss,

04:14.254 --> 04:16.210
who told you
to stop remembering?

04:16.339 --> 04:18.079
- Yeah, and so far, it's worked.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.123
I haven't had a new memory since.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.509
I'm afraid that the ones I do have,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.006
that they're gonna start to fade.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.967
- Do l have to do the whole
"you're freaked out,

04:26.141 --> 04:28.223
"and it's blocking you,
and if you just let go,

04:28.310 --> 04:30.346
it'll eventually come back"
speech?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.135
- Yeah, let's not do that.
- Good.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.929
We need to get
those memories out of your head

04:34.107 --> 04:37.270
and into the real world.
The way a cop would.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.524
- You think I should make a facial composite
of the Colorado Kid?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.359
- Well, I was gonna say
that thing they do on cop shows

04:43.533 --> 04:46.616
where they make a face
with a computer, but, yeah.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.574
(cellphone beeps)
- Huh.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.333
(sighs)

04:52.417 --> 04:54.749
I'm sorry. Can we...

04:54.836 --> 04:57.418
can we try to set up another, um...

04:57.589 --> 04:58.578
- Session.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.748
Or, you know, appointment.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.503
One patient I had called them dates,

05:02.677 --> 05:05.965
but I had to drop him.
- Yeah, that was a good call.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.482
- Vic's name is Jason Dooley.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.107
Neighbour heard screams,
called it in.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.981
Took Haven Fire Department five minutes
to break the door down.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.855
Dooley was crashing by the time
they loaded him on the ambulance,

05:24.950 --> 05:26.941
and won't know till we get
the labs back,

05:27.118 --> 05:30.201
but I'm assuming
the blood is not the attacker's.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.825
- They took his eyes out
with a spoon.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.163
His eyes.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.328
You're not gonna say it?
- We don't know enough yet.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.337
- Come on, Nathan,
we have three vics,

05:41.508 --> 05:42.839
two with missing body parts.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.510
This could be the bolt-gun killer.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.010
- There's no shortage of people
who'd want to hurt this guy.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.055
Dooley's well known
to Haven PD. He's a creep.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.347
Shoots up-skirt videos,

05:51.434 --> 05:54.176
makes a living posting 'em online.
- Why isn't this guy in jail?

05:54.354 --> 05:55.685
- Knew how to work the system,

05:55.772 --> 05:57.763
slipped through on technicalities.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.560
If the person who took you did this,
we'll get him.

06:02.654 --> 06:05.020
I know how important that is to you.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.234
- lt's Laverne for you, chief.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.986
- Nathan, hon, you copy?

06:09.077 --> 06:10.408
- Yeah, Laverne, go ahead.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.574
- Just heard from the hospital.
Mr. Dooley’s stab/e.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.997
- He's alive?

06:16.167 --> 06:19.500
- Which means we might have a witness
who saw the bolt-gun killer.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.415
(theme music)

06:52.203 --> 06:53.579
Before the attack,

06:53.747 --> 06:56.614
you didn't catch a glimpse
ofanyone?

06:56.708 --> 06:58.869
And you're sure he didn't have
any kind of gun?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.626
- It was fast.
I barely had time to scream.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.503
- But you're sure it was a person?
- What else would it be?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.715
- Haven Fire Department
had to break down your door

07:06.801 --> 07:08.086
to get through your dead bolts.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.214
You have any idea
how your attacker made it in?

07:10.388 --> 07:12.299
- No. I told you, it's impossible.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.886
I even have motion-sensor alarms
for when I'm gone.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.432
- Yeah, we know.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.144
- We need to prep him for surgery now.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.777
- Bolt-gun killer's been
surgically removing body parts.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.695
Dooley's wounds
aren't precise at all.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.952
(sighs)

07:36.039 --> 07:37.904
He's not gonna come after you again.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.580
- You know what?
I wish that he would.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.709
He knows more about me than I do.
He knows about the Colorado Kid.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.744
I've been trying everything,
but I am running out of time.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.379
- Parker--
- No, I even contacted the feds,

07:46.466 --> 07:50.084
and | asked them to send me
any murder that fits the profile.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.760
If we miss a victim, then--
- Parker...

07:52.847 --> 07:54.132
(sighs)

07:54.224 --> 07:57.887
The bolt-gun killer has the tattoo.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.769
He's one of the Guard,

08:02.941 --> 08:05.227
and I'm getting in with them.
- Nathan,

08:05.402 --> 08:09.566
it's not gonna be easy to convince them
to accept the chief of police.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.692
- Well, I already have a contact.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.658
Name's Jordan McKee,
and she's starting to trust me.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.740
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.834
You know that, right?

08:27.048 --> 08:30.336
- I know.
(cellphone beeps)

08:34.305 --> 08:37.263
- Tech pulled a partial image
off Dooley's hard drive.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.760
He had a security app.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.142
It's only a single frame, but...

08:41.521 --> 08:43.182
here's our suspect.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.517
- Is that a woman?

08:50.321 --> 08:53.188
It's definitely not the bolt-gun killer.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.151
- Sorry, folks. We're closed.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.991
Let's go.
Go make memories someplace else.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.071
Not my fault.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.786
Send your letters of protest

09:03.877 --> 09:05.333
to Judge Boone
and the Liquor Board.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.251
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa. Hang on.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.254
Yeah, you're drunk.
Give me your keys.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.759
Thank you very much.
- You suck, Crocker.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.350
- Hey, lady, look,

09:23.438 --> 09:25.303
if you're here to mess
with my truck again,

09:25.398 --> 09:26.899
she's in the shop.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.729
(scoffs)

09:40.997 --> 09:42.328
What the hell?

10:01.810 --> 10:06.645
Ma'am, have you ever heard
of the Troubles?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.565
I'm gonna go with yes.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.993
Send every cop that you have
to the Grey Gull right now!

10:22.163 --> 10:24.199
- Hey. You still owe me a drink.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.037
Dude, l'm bleeding. That's assault.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.331
- The cops are on their way,
so you can tell them when they get here.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.670
Now shut up.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.096
Oh, I'm really ready
for this day to be over.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.060
- How is it that I call you guys,
and | end up spending

10:47.230 --> 10:48.561
the night in jail?
- lt's procedure.

10:49.983 --> 10:54.272
Jack Daniels accused you of assault,
and we got plenty of papenNork to file.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.232
Anyway, you have a court date
with Judge Boone tomorrow.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.030
- Boone? Again?

11:00.118 --> 11:01.858
The guy hates me.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.411
- He's been here all night.

11:05.582 --> 11:07.789
(chuckles)

11:09.961 --> 11:11.121
- There a fight at the Gull?

11:11.296 --> 11:13.753
- No, l was attacked at the Gull.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.505
Okay, this chick is stalking me...

11:16.676 --> 11:18.758
Slashed my tires, keyed my truck.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.255
Now, not my first rodeo.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.216
She expressed her anger.
Usually that's all they want.

11:22.390 --> 11:25.757
But this woman teleported herself
inside the Grey Gull,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.092
threw me across the room,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.427
then trashed the place.

11:28.479 --> 11:32.893
So, yeah, go ahead, make fun.
l have a Troubled stalker.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.058
- Was she wearing a white dress?

11:35.236 --> 11:36.897
- What's going on here?
Am I...

11:37.071 --> 11:39.062
Am I being targeted for something?

11:39.240 --> 11:41.902
- We have reason to believe
that this woman attacked another man,

11:42.035 --> 11:44.617
took his eyeballs out with a spoon.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.740
(cell phone beeps)

11:48.082 --> 11:50.949
- We got another possible victim.
- Let's go.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.080
Duke, she's already come
after you twice, okay?

11:53.171 --> 11:54.331
You're coming with us.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.543
- Megan Berlin sustained
22 bone fractures.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.463
If she was conscious right now,
she'd be in terrible pain.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.506
It's like she fell
from a great height.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.265
But she was alone
on the ground floor,

12:08.436 --> 12:10.802
locked in a room
at Child Protective Services.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.095
- Why was she there?

12:12.273 --> 12:14.935
- Evaluation for a custody proceeding.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.937
She was accused
of shaking her six-month-old.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.488
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.320
- So we've got a peeping tom
without eyeballs

12:24.494 --> 12:25.984
and a child abuser
with broken bones,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.616
both found in locked rooms.
- Parking tickets.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.790
Yeah. She attacked my car first,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.997
and then she went
after the Grey Gull,

12:35.088 --> 12:38.626
which apparently is operating
under a questionable liquor license.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.298
- It's like she's punishing people
for their wrongdoings

12:41.469 --> 12:44.632
and, in some twisted way,

12:44.806 --> 12:46.467
making the punishment
fit the crime.

12:46.641 --> 12:47.926
- How much do we think
that she knows?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.807
- No, Duke, Duke.
- She could be going down some list

12:49.978 --> 12:51.969
of all the things
that I've done wrong lately, like...

12:52.146 --> 12:53.977
oh, I don't know,

12:54.148 --> 12:55.649
killing somebody.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.728
- Okay, then we will do
whatever we can

12:57.819 --> 12:59.229
to protect you, day and night.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.527
- Well, no place safer
than a jail cell.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.188
- Hey, jail cell's fine with me.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.568
- I'm serious.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.069
l'm immune to the Troubles,

13:06.160 --> 13:08.537
so maybe I can stop her, all right?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.705
Duke, you'll stay with me tonight.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.834
- I sleep in the raw.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.461
- Oh.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.626
- You know she's using you as bait, right?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.600
- So we're gonna sleep
in three-hour shifts.

13:32.687 --> 13:36.726
I got Haven PD driving by every hour,
so don't panic if you hear a car come by.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.522
I've got a gun, and you've got...

13:42.655 --> 13:45.613
- I'm thinking one drop of her blood,
I can probably take her.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.648
- That is, if you can get close enough.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.074
- Yeah.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.456
Thank you.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.372
You... do you really
go to sleep this early?

14:00.381 --> 14:01.666
- Good night, Duke.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.093
- Okay.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.845
(dog barking)

14:12.310 --> 14:14.346
- Come on, sugar, I don't bite.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.094
- But I do.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.055
- It's time you moved on.

14:28.743 --> 14:31.985
- You're not here for the coffee, are you?
- Did you get my messages?

14:32.080 --> 14:34.446
(door closes)

14:34.540 --> 14:37.907
That guy, why didn't you
just let him grab you?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.583
He would have gotten
a nice surprise.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.582
- Believe it or not,
I don't actually like inflicting pain.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.756
People say that touching me
is the worst thing they've ever felt.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.464
- You can't touch people.
I can't feel 'em.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.931
We're kind of the same,
you and me.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.516
- What, screwed up?

14:55.269 --> 14:59.763
Look, you're not here
to listen to my sad stories.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.023
I talked to my people.

15:03.152 --> 15:07.145
You can't just ink loyalty on your arm
and expect us to trust you.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.613
- See ya.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.738
- Wait.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.249
You want in?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.289
Prove it.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.680
- I know this guy. lt's, uh...

15:35.768 --> 15:37.383
- Duncan Fromsley.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.014
Convicted of arson a year ago.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.845
- And murder.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.685
He didn't know his son was home
when he set fire

15:43.776 --> 15:45.232
to his house for the insurance.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.696
_ Fromsley's in maximum security
at Shawshank.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.856
Stage two cancer,
refusing treatment.

15:51.033 --> 15:54.901
His wife thinks she can convince him
to get chemo if he's closer to home.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.362
- You want me to swing a transfer?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.914
- This woman is close to us.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.708
She already lost a son.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.707
- If I do this,

16:06.507 --> 16:09.715
you vouch for me,
introduce me to the others?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.422
- Yeah.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.074
- Audrey.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.821
Audrey.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.748
Audrey.
- What?

16:44.128 --> 16:47.291
- Are you sleeping?
(scoffs)

16:50.218 --> 16:52.425
You're not Lucy Ripley.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.923
You're Audrey Parker.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.555
Mostly.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.432
(chuckles)

17:01.229 --> 17:05.893
Look,evenifyouloved
the Colorado Kid,

17:05.983 --> 17:09.475
how do you know you're gonna feel
the same way if you saw him today?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.185
- I don't know.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.982
But the bolt-gun killer
seems to think so.

17:15.076 --> 17:19.069
- You trust the ramblings
of some psycho who abducted you,

17:19.247 --> 17:20.783
puts holes in people's heads,

17:20.957 --> 17:23.494
and... and cuts off
people's body parts?

17:26.629 --> 17:28.085
- It's just, I...

17:29.298 --> 17:32.916
I don't know if love is something
that can be erased.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.003
- Disappear every 27 years,

17:37.098 --> 17:39.430
you know,
you lose the people you love.

17:40.810 --> 17:44.143
They lose you.
- And then I come back again.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.595
And the whole thing,

17:45.690 --> 17:48.477
it just... it starts over and over
and over again.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.854
(chuckles)

17:50.945 --> 17:54.654
- It seems like you and me have been
fighting our fates full-time lately.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.945
And losing, I might add.

18:02.415 --> 18:06.203
- I know you only did what you did
because I asked you to.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.833
- Look, whatever happened

18:16.012 --> 18:20.506
between Sarah or Lucy
or whoever and my family,

18:20.600 --> 18:22.181
it's between them.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.808
Can't let them drag us down with them.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.224
We're better than that.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.274
Well, at least you are.
(chuckles)

18:35.239 --> 18:37.821
One good thing about the Troubles...

18:40.328 --> 18:42.785
At least I got to meet Audrey Parker.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.584
(sighs)

18:51.756 --> 18:53.371
Yeah.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.527
Good night, Audrey Parker.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.370
(sand falling)

19:30.461 --> 19:31.701
She doesn't bleed.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.161
- Freeze!

19:37.134 --> 19:38.749
Don't make me shoot.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.259
- No, shoot!

19:50.606 --> 19:52.847
Audrey, you broke her.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.906
Audrey.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.412
Hey!

20:09.083 --> 20:10.744
(piano key plays)

20:20.261 --> 20:21.717
(piano keys play)

20:22.888 --> 20:24.094
(gaSDS)

20:27.727 --> 20:29.513
- Where'd she go?

20:31.188 --> 20:33.270
Where is she?

20:38.863 --> 20:41.400
I think this Troubled woman
is a vigilante,

20:41.490 --> 20:42.946
and I think that she's using

20:43.033 --> 20:44.944
the Haven Herald’s crime blotter
as a hit list.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.027
Our peeping tom and our child abuser
were both written up,

20:48.122 --> 20:50.579
and Duke's assault charge
made the late edition.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.577
- So she's punishing the guilty.

20:52.668 --> 20:56.377
- Duke says that he didn't
actually assault anyone.

20:56.547 --> 20:57.411
- Really?

20:58.048 --> 21:00.915
- I think she's punishing
who she assumes is guilty,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.960
which means that there could be
dozens of potential victims.

21:04.054 --> 21:07.217
So I had Vince help Duke come up
with a composite sketch.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.131
I'm gonna meet Duke
at the courthouse after his hearing.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.059
We're gonna show the sketch around
and see if anybody recognizes her.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.890
- You're meeting Duke
at the courthouse?

21:13.981 --> 21:15.937
He hasn't guilted you enough
about what happened?

21:16.025 --> 21:17.686
- He is my friend,

21:17.860 --> 21:19.725
and there's a woman out there
who's trying to kill him.

21:19.820 --> 21:21.560
- No, you're right.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.270
Stay with Duke.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.107
- What is this really about?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.869
- Nothing.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.957
We're okay, Parker.

21:40.424 --> 21:41.664
- Okay.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.974
The endorsement
from the Haven PD help?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.689
- Well, I mean, the good news is,
I'm not in jail.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.736
Assault charge got thrown out.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.689
But the bad news
is that this woman

22:06.784 --> 22:08.775
is an eye-for-an-eye kind of chick,

22:08.953 --> 22:11.615
and I'm just concerned I'm not gonna
survive her punishment for murder one.

22:11.705 --> 22:14.697
- Don't worry about it.
We're not gonna let your secret get out.

22:16.418 --> 22:19.376
Now, make yourself useful.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.873
Pass these out.

22:30.975 --> 22:32.260
- It's her.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.854
- So, if our Troubled person
is a painting,

22:46.949 --> 22:48.029
how do we stop it?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.907
- Well, my first thought is that Troubles
run in families, right?

22:51.078 --> 22:52.943
So, if we can find our model,
we can find our girl.

22:53.122 --> 22:56.159
- But according to the dedication,
there was no real-life model.

22:56.250 --> 23:00.539
The artist based Lady Justice
on the classical feminine ideal.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.618
- Feminine ideal?

23:02.506 --> 23:03.666
Look at my face...

23:03.841 --> 23:05.627
More like a Terminator
made of plaster.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.424
- Plaster?

23:07.511 --> 23:09.752
- Audrey shot her, she shattered.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.429
She came back, and she was made
of clay or something.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.513
- Oh, dear.
- Guys, I hate it when you do that.

23:16.604 --> 23:20.347
- Your Lady Justice
might be a golem.

23:20.441 --> 23:23.183
- What?
- The Lord Of The Ring guy?

23:23.277 --> 23:25.142
- No, it's different from that.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.946
People often confuse the Troubles
with myths and legends.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.694
Golems appear in folklore,

23:30.784 --> 23:34.322
but they become real
when unleashed by a Troubled person.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.280
- Golems are usually made
of dirt or clay,

23:37.374 --> 23:39.490
designed to do
its master's bidding.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.792
- They're dangerous, indestructible.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.540
- There must be some way to kill it.

23:43.714 --> 23:46.046
- I'm afraid...
- There isn't.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.465
- You know what? I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

23:53.390 --> 23:56.382
- All right. So, maybe if we can find
who brought this thing to life,

23:56.477 --> 23:57.808
its master,

23:57.895 --> 23:59.556
we can get them to call her off.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.887
- Hang on.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.067
Can you handle this without me?

24:08.238 --> 24:11.401
My contact, Jordan,
wants me to swing a prisoner transfer.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.531
Could be my ticket into the Guard.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.530
- Are you sure that that's a good idea?

24:15.621 --> 24:18.328
I wouldn't want you
to compromise yourself.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.369
- Whatever it takes, right?

24:23.212 --> 24:25.624
- You really... you do not need
to do this for me.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.833
It's not gonna change anything.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.632
- It's not about you.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.338
I'm just trying to catch a killer.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.847
(doorbells chime)

24:43.107 --> 24:44.688
- So, Tommy, explain it to me.

24:44.775 --> 24:48.233
You trade a life of big crime,
bad guys, and fast women for...

24:48.404 --> 24:49.735
this.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.733
- I like the quiet.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.189
- I'm just saying...

24:53.283 --> 24:54.534
Makes you wonder.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.404
- Guys, l have something.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.111
Jason Dooley,
he was arrested in August.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.496
He got out of an invasion-of—privacy charge

25:01.583 --> 25:04.370
a month later.
Then we have Megan Berlin.

25:04.461 --> 25:06.622
She was brought
into Child Protective Services,

25:06.797 --> 25:08.207
and she had a custody hearing.

25:08.298 --> 25:11.665
Both of them
with your old friend.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.092
- The honourable Judge Boone?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.133
- A Troubled judge?

25:17.224 --> 25:19.636
- Maybe Boone is creating
the golem to punish

25:19.810 --> 25:21.721
the ones that he had to let off easy.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.430
- Yeah, I knew he had it out for me.
- We need to be careful, all right?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.231
If he's controlling this monster,

25:28.318 --> 25:30.980
the last thing we want to do
is piss him off.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.192
- You may find
this proceeding amusing,

25:34.283 --> 25:36.319
but cutting the head
off the rifleman statue

25:36.493 --> 25:39.109
is not a joking matter.
It's vandalism.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.411
However, since the administrators

25:41.498 --> 25:44.285
of East Haven High
are not pressing charges,

25:44.376 --> 25:45.991
you're all free to go.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.536
Court is adjourned
until tomorrow.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.496
- Let's go.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.293
- Your Honour, a word?

25:58.932 --> 26:01.674
A favour, actually.

26:01.852 --> 26:02.887
- A favour?

26:02.978 --> 26:05.845
- I'd like to transfer

26:05.939 --> 26:09.352
Duncan Fromsley
to a minimum security ward.

26:11.153 --> 26:14.145
- And a transfer needs to go
through proper channels.

26:14.948 --> 26:18.486
- Your Honour,
if there is anything I can do...

26:21.205 --> 26:25.539
- Are you offering an officer of the court
a bribe, chief?

26:25.626 --> 26:27.708
- l was not trying to.

26:27.878 --> 26:30.164
- Because I like single malts.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.549
I know the drill.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.837
Sometimes to uphold the law,

26:39.932 --> 26:42.093
you can't be afraid to bend it...

26:42.184 --> 26:44.220
or crumple it up into a ball

26:44.311 --> 26:48.020
and throw it in the damn corner.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.770
(cellphone dialing)

26:51.860 --> 26:53.145
Yeah, Warden Buxton.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.774
(chuckles)
lt's Booney.

26:55.864 --> 26:59.197
Listen, transfer some con for me
on the down-low today,

26:59.284 --> 27:01.821
and you won't have to pay me
the money you owe me

27:01.912 --> 27:05.075
for that eagle of mine on 17 last week.

27:08.836 --> 27:11.748
(cellphone rings)

27:11.922 --> 27:13.082
- Parker, what's up?

27:13.257 --> 27:15.748
- Finally, I got you.
It’s Judge Boone.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.084
I think he’s the guy.
I think he’s creating the golem.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.502
- l was just with him.

27:29.273 --> 27:33.642
Parker, I don't think Boone is our guy.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.983
And the painting's empty.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.872
- It turns out the coroner says
that the cause of death was a broken neck.

27:52.045 --> 27:55.208
He says that these are just symbolic.
I think we all get the meaning.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.797
Someone didn't like the way
the judge was doing his job.

27:59.803 --> 28:02.089
- Should you be doing that?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.546
- What?

28:03.724 --> 28:05.885
- You're... he's...
You're tainting evidence.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.637
- Oh, pardon me, CSl.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.389
Like your clay lady's
gonna leave fingerprints.

28:09.563 --> 28:10.894
Why don't you do me a favour, man?

28:11.064 --> 28:12.804
Mind your business
while the cops do the cop talk.

28:12.900 --> 28:15.642
- Hey. She's still out there.
I just saw half a dozen

28:15.819 --> 28:18.902
high-school kids get away
with decapitating a statue.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.449
- You're right. You're right.
I'll get a 20 on the kids,

28:21.533 --> 28:23.319
make sure they don't lose
their heads.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.660
- I think I know
why Boone was killed like that.

28:26.747 --> 28:28.078
- Good...

28:28.248 --> 28:29.954
'Cause I doubt he had
his own name on the docket.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.990
- He was corrupt.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.621
- How do you know?

28:33.712 --> 28:36.545
- He was helping me with Jordan.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.255
- Well, that explains
why Lady Justice

28:39.426 --> 28:42.293
would punish him so harshly.
It's like she took it personally.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.427
- You're thinking
our Troubled person knew him,

28:44.514 --> 28:46.095
worked here in the courthouse?

28:46.266 --> 28:49.133
- Yeah. We should start looking.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.935
- I'm gonna go help Tommy
round up those kids.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.608
- Our high-schoolers
are hanging out

28:55.692 --> 28:56.943
at the ice cream shop.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.853
But our lady friend
is not in attendance.

29:00.948 --> 29:04.532
- Maybe she's shy, Tommy.
- Not in that dress, she ain't.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.984
(phone rings)

29:07.079 --> 29:10.822
- Keep eyes on the kids.
(phone beeps)

29:10.916 --> 29:13.828
Jordan... it's done.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.501
Fromsley's set to be transferred
within the hour.

29:16.588 --> 29:19.125
- Within the hour? Really?

29:19.216 --> 29:21.207
- Yeah, I was on my way over
to tell you.

29:23.303 --> 29:26.761
Well, lfigured
the sooner the better.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.182
I can stop by the diner
and show you the papenNork.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.226
-No. I didn't come in to work today.

29:33.313 --> 29:37.477
Look... I gotta go.
(phone beeps)

29:37.567 --> 29:39.023
(phone beeps)

29:42.990 --> 29:44.981
(engine turning)

29:50.998 --> 29:52.534
- That's weird.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.328
These are all time-stamped,
and that means

29:55.502 --> 29:57.038
that the papenNork
for your assault charge

29:57.129 --> 30:00.212
had barely hit Boone's desk
by the time we were attacked.

30:00.299 --> 30:01.880
- Plenty of people
saw me get arrested.

30:03.093 --> 30:05.379
Maybe our guy's in Haven PD.

30:05.554 --> 30:07.545
(snaps fingers)
Like Tommy boy.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.593
- No way.

30:10.684 --> 30:14.268
One person was there
for Megan Berlin's deposition,

30:14.354 --> 30:15.685
Jason Dooley's trial,

30:15.856 --> 30:18.848
and was there at the same time
you were in court.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.814
(scoffs)

30:22.904 --> 30:24.644
- No way.

30:29.786 --> 30:33.074
- Do either of you guys
know how to get to l-95?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.451
I got turned around.
The map said it was east, but...

30:35.542 --> 30:38.204
(grunting in pain)

30:39.254 --> 30:42.792
- Aah!
(grunting in pain)

30:48.889 --> 30:51.050
(grunting in pain)

31:01.234 --> 31:02.485
(keys jingling)

31:07.407 --> 31:10.023
- We're good! Let's go!

31:23.423 --> 31:25.459
(gunshot)

31:25.550 --> 31:27.541
What the hell are you doing here?

31:27.719 --> 31:30.176
- Saving your life.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.593
Go.

31:34.768 --> 31:36.099
Just go.

31:38.939 --> 31:42.807
(car door closes, engine turning)

31:46.446 --> 31:49.563
- You're doing this, Lynette.
- That's just not possible.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.151
- Look at the mural.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.359
You see it every day.

31:54.454 --> 31:57.491
Lady Justice is gone.
You've released her.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.915
She's a weapon,
and she is out there hurting people.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.372
- She could be out there cutting
some high-school kid's head off right now.

32:04.339 --> 32:08.127
- You enjoying this?
You know, harassment's a crime.

32:08.301 --> 32:10.678
Yet another offense to add
to your lengthy rap sheet.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.003
- I'm sorry...

32:13.098 --> 32:14.838
about all of that.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.514
I'm sorry that...

32:18.812 --> 32:20.894
I made fun of your sweater.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.222
- No, you're not.

32:23.316 --> 32:25.398
You're not sorry for anything.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.567
- I'm not sorry for anything?

32:27.654 --> 32:29.155
- Duke.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.321
- Lady, you don't know
the slightest thing about me.

32:31.408 --> 32:33.273
- Duke, would you just
let me handle this?

32:33.368 --> 32:35.905
- You don't know what I've done,
what I've had to live with.

32:37.372 --> 32:39.078
I'm gonna show Lynette
what she's doing.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.703
See, I can prove it to her.
- Duke, stop.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.954
- Yeah, you released that thing.
- Don't.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.660
- But she's in the wrong place.

32:45.839 --> 32:48.046
Because nobody deserves
to be punished more than me.

32:48.133 --> 32:50.499
- Duke, this isn't the way.

32:50.677 --> 32:52.542
- You think I'm a bad guy?

32:52.721 --> 32:55.713
Well, you're right. I am a bad guy.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.595
l murdered a man.
A helpless, defenseless man.

32:59.686 --> 33:01.847
l murdered him,
and I got away with it.

33:04.858 --> 33:07.895
What do you think of that, Lynette?
(gaSDS)

33:17.162 --> 33:18.868
- You're a murderer.

33:18.955 --> 33:22.368
- Lynette, it's not as simple as that.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.578
What he did saved hundreds of lives.

33:24.669 --> 33:28.503
Despite his actions, despite his fate,
he is a good man.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.462
He is a good man.

33:35.597 --> 33:36.712
Don't let him die.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.971
- Nobody knows what it's like.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.727
Every day, I sit in this courtroom.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.735
And I see monsters,

33:52.906 --> 33:55.113
and they get to walk away.

33:56.326 --> 33:59.784
And I'd look at her, and I'd think,

33:59.871 --> 34:02.032
"That is justice."

34:04.918 --> 34:07.079
- Do you want to be responsible
for another death?

34:07.254 --> 34:09.620
Killing someone
who did it to save lives?

34:09.798 --> 34:12.164
That's not justice.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.805
- But if you did what you did
to save lives, then...

34:20.892 --> 34:22.393
(grunts)

34:24.271 --> 34:26.478
l was wrong to judge you.

34:30.986 --> 34:33.227
And the man with the eyes,

34:34.155 --> 34:36.282
and the woman
with the broken bones...

34:36.449 --> 34:37.825
- Stop, Lynette.

34:39.452 --> 34:40.988
- I did that.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.694
That's criminal.

34:44.124 --> 34:47.116
I should be punished.

34:48.378 --> 34:49.743
Aah!
(gaSDS)

34:51.006 --> 34:52.246
(whimpering)

34:54.092 --> 34:54.956
(gaSDS)

34:55.135 --> 34:58.502
(whimpering)

35:20.368 --> 35:21.574
- Audrey, look at that.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.285
- She's part of the mural now.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.305
And with that, Duke Crocker,
you are free and clear.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.143
No charges, no parking tickets,
no warrants.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.599
- Thank you for the clean slate.

35:52.984 --> 35:56.101
- You know, they're overrated.
| get one every 27 years,

35:56.279 --> 35:58.861
except for | just lose
all my friends and memories, so...

35:58.948 --> 36:02.076
- Hey. Hey, look,
you don't know that.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.572
And for the record, this...

36:05.872 --> 36:08.113
it's kind of hard to forget.
(chuckles)

36:09.084 --> 36:11.370
I wanted to ask...

36:13.713 --> 36:16.705
Did you mean all that stuff
you said earlier

36:16.883 --> 36:20.250
about me being a... a good man?

36:21.721 --> 36:23.803
- You have your moments.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.630
- Yeah.

36:25.725 --> 36:28.762
Okay, well, now that I am a good man,

36:28.853 --> 36:31.640
I'm gonna go do about
three years of back taxes.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.360
- Hey.
- You missed all the excitement.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.782
- What's all this about?

36:44.953 --> 36:47.239
- We're at a dead end
with this whole bolt-gun killer,

36:47.414 --> 36:48.870
so...
(sighs)

36:49.040 --> 36:50.655
The feds, you know,
they keep promising me

36:50.750 --> 36:52.411
that they're gonna send me
files of all the vics

36:52.585 --> 36:55.827
with missing parts, but that's...
hasn't happened yet.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.129
So, in the meantime,
I'm gonna get Claire to come by.

36:58.925 --> 36:59.880
- For therapy?

37:00.051 --> 37:03.214
- No, actually, to do a facial composite
of the Colorado Kid.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.803
If the bolt-gun killer is after him,

37:05.974 --> 37:08.090
then we have to know his identity.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.516
- Why don't you just get Vince
to do a sketch?

37:11.438 --> 37:14.271
- Vince and Dave,
they're a little too interested.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.187
Things are different now,
you know?

37:19.654 --> 37:21.519
- Yeah, I do.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.606
- So how did it go with your contact,
Jordan?

37:24.784 --> 37:27.742
Did the prisoner transfer go through?

37:29.706 --> 37:31.196
- Yeah.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.282
- No drama?

37:34.794 --> 37:36.409
- No drama.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.758
- Good.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.800
(sighs)

37:47.891 --> 37:49.802
(fax machine beeps)

38:08.745 --> 38:11.327
(door opens)

38:11.498 --> 38:13.489
- We're closed.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.198
(door closes)

38:20.632 --> 38:21.997
- You lied to me.

38:22.091 --> 38:24.002
I need to know
what your people are doing,

38:24.093 --> 38:25.754
what I'm involved in.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.760
- It's not what you think.

38:27.931 --> 38:31.674
- I found out Duncan Fromsley
doesn't have cancer.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.012
I called and checked.

38:34.103 --> 38:37.766
But he did set a fire
that killed his son.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.852
- He's Troubled.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.934
All Fromsley did
was have a nightmare,

38:42.028 --> 38:45.191
and when he woke up,
his bed was on fire.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.858
Last week, the doctors at Shawshank
cutout his sleep meds.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.402
Imagine if he set fire to a prison.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.738
- Why didn't you tell me?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.244
- What would that get him exactly?

38:57.335 --> 39:00.418
Asbestos walls and a life in solitary?

39:01.381 --> 39:03.087
He's safe now.

39:03.174 --> 39:07.383
My people help the Troubled,
and we do it any way we can.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.884
- If you'd just told me the truth,

39:14.727 --> 39:18.219
you wouldn't have had
to hurt those guys.

39:22.318 --> 39:26.027
l was there. I saw you.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.733
You hated it.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.500
- Don't.

39:45.425 --> 39:47.006
- It's okay.

39:51.431 --> 39:54.047
- Why are you doing this?

39:58.271 --> 39:59.807
- I want to.

40:16.623 --> 40:18.830
What would I do

40:19.000 --> 40:23.835
If I couldn’t have you

40:32.388 --> 40:34.128
Good night.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.813
(indistinct chatter over police radio)

40:44.984 --> 40:46.645
(keys clacking)

40:49.989 --> 40:51.820
(sighs)

40:51.908 --> 40:55.400
- This is pointless.
I'm never gonna get it.

40:55.578 --> 40:58.115
- Well, you're not gonna get it
because you don't want to get it.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.529
- I want to get it.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.289
The Colorado Kid
is the answer to everything.

41:02.460 --> 41:04.667
- And those answers
might shatter your world.

41:06.339 --> 41:07.749
You're blocking.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.922
Okay, let's, uh, try an exercise.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.169
Close your eyes.

41:14.180 --> 41:18.389
Now, imagine your head
is like a balloon.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.593
Light as air.

41:23.523 --> 41:25.388
(computer beeps)

41:25.566 --> 41:27.022
Seriously?

41:28.653 --> 41:29.733
- Finally.

41:29.904 --> 41:32.270
Yes. The file from the feds.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.196
I knew it.

41:34.283 --> 41:36.274
Six weeks ago,
there was a woman who was murdered

41:36.369 --> 41:37.734
in Somerset County.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.527
She was buried
in a shallow grave,

41:39.706 --> 41:42.197
had a...
(key clacks)

41:42.375 --> 41:45.913
...circular wound at the base
of the skull, and her...

41:47.088 --> 41:49.329
chin was sliced off.

41:55.054 --> 41:56.464
Oh, no.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.595
- What is it?
Is it the Colorado Kid?

42:05.773 --> 42:08.230
- No. No, it's the bolt-gun killer.

42:08.401 --> 42:09.390
- What about him?

42:12.822 --> 42:14.562
- What if he's not...

42:15.241 --> 42:18.733
What if he's not using
body parts for trophies?

42:20.038 --> 42:21.903
What if he's building a woman?

42:59.452 --> 43:02.239
