Lisa, this is going
too slow for me.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.613
And I work at the DMV.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.614
Mind if we
take a nap?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.549
I'll have to make it
more neo-classical

02:30.551 --> 02:32.885
and less Mannerist, but okay.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.254
You say such
cute little...

02:35.256 --> 02:37.723
(snoring)

02:37.725 --> 02:40.592
I jumped in front
of your picture.

02:40.594 --> 02:41.493
Now it's ruined.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.829
Bart, this isn't a photograph.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.964
I'm not gonna
just paint you into my-- aw!

02:45.966 --> 02:48.834
You just ruined
six months' work!

02:48.836 --> 02:51.570
I'm really sorry
it wasn't a year.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.404
(cackling)

02:52.406 --> 02:55.507
Aw! You're gonna regret
the day you were born.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.477
I already do.
It's too close to Christmas.

02:58.479 --> 02:59.678
Ugh!

03:02.550 --> 03:05.150
(gasping anxiously)

03:07.888 --> 03:09.288
(gasps)

03:09.290 --> 03:11.590
Not to worry.

03:13.894 --> 03:14.693
Now what?

03:14.695 --> 03:19.531
Bart, I'm afraid we need the
help of someone older and wiser.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.433
(laughing)

03:21.435 --> 03:25.771
Oh, I get to enjoy this,
but I'm not responsible.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.708
Actually, Dad, as the
supervising parent today,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.910
you'll get your share
of the blame, too.

03:31.912 --> 03:32.711
(shrieks)

03:32.713 --> 03:33.745
What do I do?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.280
Patty's gonna kill me.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.481
Unless...

03:36.483 --> 03:37.683
I kill her first.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.385
I put the body in the car,
I dump the car in the lake,

03:40.387 --> 03:42.688
I put a James Taylor CD
in the stereo

03:42.690 --> 03:43.922
so they think it's a suicide...

03:43.924 --> 03:46.858
Why don't you just cut the paint
out of her hair?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.528
Oh, fine, whatever.

03:49.530 --> 03:53.532
I'll just keep cutting
till I hit something solid.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.336

And now, to break the news
as gently as I know how.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.445

04:06.447 --> 04:08.747
What happened to you?

04:09.683 --> 04:12.618
Whoa! Who undid my do?

04:12.620 --> 04:15.854
I didn't do diddily,
and certainly not squat.

04:15.856 --> 04:19.491
Hmm, actually,
it's kind of cute.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.059
You look like Posh Spice.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.428
That's just what
I was going for.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.264
I was going for Scary.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.031
You did this?

04:26.033 --> 04:30.502
With your fat fingers and your
brain the size of a Superball?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.308
And stay out.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.544
I can't believe
I'm saying this...

04:39.546 --> 04:41.713
Homer Simpson, do me.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.916
I meant my hair.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.785
Oh! Oh...

04:46.787 --> 04:47.986
Idiot.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.824
Milhouse, check it out.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.727
I put a roadblock
on the curly slide.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.498
Isn't this the
greatest day ever?

04:59.500 --> 05:03.335
(sighs heavily) There are
no more great days, Bart.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.503
Just days.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.737
What's wrong, man?

05:05.739 --> 05:07.706
Something happened
last night.

05:07.708 --> 05:11.143
Something that
really changed me.

05:11.145 --> 05:14.546
<i>My mom put in the</i>
Finding Nemo DVD,

05:14.548 --> 05:16.948
<i>but then she got</i>
<i>a phone call.</i>

05:16.950 --> 05:18.083
(phone ringing)

05:18.085 --> 05:19.251
<i>So I started it myself.</i>

05:19.253 --> 05:23.889
<i>Did you know it has a chapter</i>
<i>before chapter two?</i>

05:23.891 --> 05:27.759
<i>A chapter where we meet</i>
<i>Nemo's mother.</i>

05:27.761 --> 05:28.994
(gasps)

05:28.996 --> 05:30.629
Nemo doesn't
have a mother.

05:30.631 --> 05:34.633
Not after Chapter One,
he doesn't.

05:42.576 --> 05:47.045
If death can happen to a fish,
it can happen to anyone.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.381
You've gotta live life
while you can.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.984
So I'm gonna finally proclaim
my love for Lisa.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.953
That's your take-away
from<i> Nemo?</i>

05:54.955 --> 05:57.856
I think you've already made
your feelings for Lisa clear.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.825
Well, I can make them
more clear.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.993
You see, in the past,
I've been too subtle.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.730
It's my curse-- subtlety!

06:04.732 --> 06:06.431
(groans)

06:06.967 --> 06:09.968
Homer, thanks to your
unlicensed barbery,

06:09.970 --> 06:12.571
Patty and Selma have been
getting compliments

06:12.573 --> 06:14.139
all day at the DMV.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.874
You two look good.

06:15.876 --> 06:16.975
Open-casket good.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.444
(both chuckle)Well!
(doorbell rings)

06:19.813 --> 06:21.446
I hear this is the home

06:21.448 --> 06:22.581
of Springfield's hottest
hairdresser.

06:22.583 --> 06:26.852
I need a haircut-- and I need
it in three, two, one, now.

06:26.854 --> 06:27.986
Lady, I'm not a hairdresser.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.623
I just put a new lid
on a couple of trashcans.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.425
(both growling)

06:34.528 --> 06:36.061
(gasps)
A hundred dollars?!

06:36.063 --> 06:38.797
Marge, how much is
that in smackaroos?

06:38.799 --> 06:40.599
One hundred.
(whoops)

06:48.909 --> 06:51.009
Wow. Wow.

06:51.011 --> 06:51.977
Wow!

07:01.155 --> 07:02.654
Wow!

07:02.656 --> 07:05.157
Hello, airport piano bar.

07:05.159 --> 07:07.192
And it'll look good
in the morning, too.

07:07.194 --> 07:09.661
Are you sure you
don't have a salon?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.863
Well, I open
a lot of crazy things

07:11.865 --> 07:14.966
when I'm drunk,
but I don't think so.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.435
Too bad.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.170
Just call me
"Homer Fingerhands."

07:18.172 --> 07:21.907
I'd rather call you by your
normal name, if that's okay.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.975
But I never knew you
were so good with hair.

07:23.977 --> 07:28.146
Marge, when someone loses their
hair, they miss it the most.

07:28.148 --> 07:32.117
It's like a beloved dog
that died on your head.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.252
(knocking on door)

07:34.254 --> 07:36.788
You better not be brushing
your hair again.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.723
Uh, uh, no, I'm, uh...

07:38.725 --> 07:40.592
just exploring my body.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.661
You better be.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.195
Oh, hair.

07:43.197 --> 07:46.631
I'll love you
when you're old and gray.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.566
Huh?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.968
Well, two can play at that game.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.604
(grunts)

07:52.873 --> 07:57.042
Now that my soft,
chestnut mane is gone,

07:57.044 --> 07:59.077
I dream of cutting hair,
styling hair,

07:59.079 --> 08:03.048
making hair shorter
in exchange for money.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.716
Maybe I should open
a hair salon.

08:04.718 --> 08:08.687
Well,<i> Newsweek</i> magazine did say
it's good to change careers,

08:08.689 --> 08:11.089
right after they laid off
all their editors.

08:11.091 --> 08:11.790
Yeah.

08:11.792 --> 08:16.194
But what if I can't find any
commercial rental property?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.136
(buzzing)

08:25.138 --> 08:29.975
I really thought people would
like to harvest their own honey.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.077
Oh, how they hated it.

08:39.253 --> 08:42.521
Attention, lovers of love.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.022
Let it be known by all:

08:44.024 --> 08:48.059
Lisa Simpson is
the smartest, sweetest,

08:48.061 --> 08:50.896
most perfectest girl
in the whole world,

08:50.898 --> 08:55.166
and I shall not rest
until I am her boyfriend.

08:55.168 --> 08:56.067
(groans)

08:56.069 --> 09:00.839
I know you like music, Lisa,
so I'm gonna perform a love song

09:00.841 --> 09:03.108
I wrote... for you.

09:05.612 --> 09:08.680
Oh yeah, it's a theremin.

09:10.083 --> 09:14.886
(to the tune of "Greensleeves"):
♪ Teacher said, don't
eat the paste ♪

09:14.888 --> 09:18.323
♪ 'Tis apt to make you spew ♪

09:18.325 --> 09:22.661
♪ I ate the paste,
and liked the taste ♪

09:22.663 --> 09:25.897
♪ Passed out
and dreamed of you. ♪

09:25.899 --> 09:28.700
Okay--
first of all, it's never wise

09:28.702 --> 09:30.702
to use the word "spew"
in a love song.

09:30.704 --> 09:34.039
♪ Lisa, Lisa, maid so fair ♪

09:34.041 --> 09:37.642

09:48.188 --> 09:50.922
So, Lisa, I love you.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.758
Is that love
"requited" or "un"?

09:53.760 --> 09:59.097
I'm sorry, but I don't love
you, Milhouse, and I never will.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.169
(groans)

10:04.805 --> 10:07.772
GIRL:
I thought that was beautiful.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.175
You did?

10:10.177 --> 10:13.712
Yeah. It was romantic
and it rhymed.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.781
Well, I used a rhyming
dictionary,

10:16.783 --> 10:18.850
but it only
gives you options.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.420
The job of the poet is to say,
"This one, I guess."

10:22.422 --> 10:23.655
(laughs)

10:23.657 --> 10:24.122
I'm Taffy.

10:24.124 --> 10:27.158
Would you like to help me
roll the theremin

10:27.160 --> 10:29.227
back to the A.V. closet?

10:29.229 --> 10:30.962
It's a date.

10:32.232 --> 10:36.835
Hm! That theremin has paid
for itself again and again.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.238
All day long, Apu goes
on about Lady Gaga,

10:40.240 --> 10:42.974
who is doing nothing that
Rava Khatan was not doing

10:42.976 --> 10:46.778
20 years ago, while she was
a member of Parliament.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.714
Oh, now, how could
someone as young as you

10:49.716 --> 10:51.249
know about 20 years ago?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.818
Oh!
(laughs, stammers nervously)

10:53.820 --> 10:57.889
Funny how my Timothy always
uses the short-form baptism

10:57.891 --> 11:00.025
when there's a basketball game
he wants to watch...

11:00.027 --> 11:01.126
The worst know-it-all!
I can't--

11:01.128 --> 11:02.761
Wears the same pants
for a month!

11:02.763 --> 11:03.995
I could just talk on and on!

11:03.997 --> 11:07.132
(high-pitched,
rapid-fire talking)

11:10.404 --> 11:12.737
Homie, are you even
listening to me?

11:12.739 --> 11:15.273
Because I have
so much to tell you:

11:15.275 --> 11:17.842
The mailman did
the other side of the street

11:17.844 --> 11:19.077
before our side.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.179
Turns out it was
a substitute.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.781
(groans)
I'm sorry, honey.

11:22.783 --> 11:26.351
All day long I have
to listen to women talk.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.887
Not a good time!

11:30.290 --> 11:32.157
(school bell rings)

11:33.226 --> 11:35.960
Hey, Lise, those books
aren't gonna pick
themselves up.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.096
Oh. Usually,
Milhouse does it.

11:38.098 --> 11:39.164
Hey, guys.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.965
Uh, Lisa, you
dropped your books.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.067
When you pick 'em up,

11:42.069 --> 11:43.835
make sure you bend
your knees.

11:43.837 --> 11:47.072
You know so much about
body mechanics!

11:47.074 --> 11:51.242
Well, I've worn a lot of
different braces in my time.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.277
(sighs)

11:52.279 --> 11:54.079
This dame is
really into you!

11:54.081 --> 11:55.113
She sure is.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.048
This morning I got
to second base...

11:57.050 --> 11:59.984
on our walk around
the softball diamond.

11:59.986 --> 12:02.153
(Milhouse laughs)

12:02.155 --> 12:05.757
Why would a popular
fifth-grader like Taffy be

12:05.759 --> 12:07.459
interested in a Milhouse
like Milhouse?

12:07.461 --> 12:08.993
I dunno.
It's one of those mysteries,

12:08.995 --> 12:12.230
like how do my clothes get clean
and put back in my drawers?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.899
Well, I'm gonna find out
why, because this is...

12:14.901 --> 12:16.868
(back cracks,
Lisa groans)

12:16.870 --> 12:19.904
Knees, Lisa!
Knees!

12:20.340 --> 12:22.907
(women all talking at once)
HOMER:
Mm-hmm. Oh, yes, right.

12:22.909 --> 12:23.475
Ooh, oh! Mm-hmm.

12:23.477 --> 12:26.311
I know Kirk resents
that the dog likes me more,

12:26.313 --> 12:31.249
but Rex is just establishing
dominance over the weaker male.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.051
That's what
miniature dachshunds do.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.252
(wearily):
Oh, yeah.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.122
Men are such dogs,
and vice versa.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.090
Is there anyone in here
that just wants

12:39.092 --> 12:41.092
a haircut with
no chitchat?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.827
No, not me.
No.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.896
Hey, I don't want a
conversation.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.398
Oh?!
I just want you
to listen

12:47.400 --> 12:50.301
while I talk about
the loser I'm married to.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.237
(screaming)

12:52.239 --> 12:55.073
(wailing, sobbing)

12:55.075 --> 12:57.041
(dogs barking)

12:57.043 --> 12:59.944
(sobbing)

13:01.915 --> 13:04.449
These are really good scissors.

13:05.051 --> 13:08.987
All day long, they tell me
stupid, pointless,

13:08.989 --> 13:13.057
boring stories, and I have
to stand there listening

13:13.059 --> 13:16.494
with a phony grin
plastered on my face.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.162
Uh-huh.

13:17.164 --> 13:19.030
Well, Homer,
you're safe here.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.866
You can forget everything
they said.

13:22.969 --> 13:23.968
(gasps)

13:34.181 --> 13:34.913
When I look at you,

13:34.915 --> 13:38.283
all I see are the foibles that
drive your women crazy!

13:38.285 --> 13:41.119
Foibles! Foibles! Foibles!

13:41.121 --> 13:42.987
Calm down there, Homer.

13:43.623 --> 13:44.856
(shrieks)

13:44.858 --> 13:46.324
What got into him?

13:46.326 --> 13:49.994
The freaky ad campaign
they're running.

13:55.235 --> 13:59.003
Homer, can you make me
look fan-cy?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.572
Sorry, Sarah,
I'm retired.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.440
But tonight's
the Policemen's Ball!

14:02.442 --> 14:04.008
And if you let
my Sarah down,

14:04.010 --> 14:07.478
I can make life
very difficult for you.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.914
I'd like to see you try.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.083
Huh, where you goin'?
Excuse me.

14:12.085 --> 14:12.917
Uh-uh-uh!

14:12.919 --> 14:14.485
Come on! Would you...?
No, no.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.119
Oh, buh!

14:15.121 --> 14:18.489
I, uh, I can also make
very annoying noises.

14:18.491 --> 14:22.594
(oscillating whine)

14:22.596 --> 14:26.598
(screeching, wailing,
and warbling)

14:26.600 --> 14:29.033
Come on, bro,
don't hassle me!

14:29.936 --> 14:30.602
Stop that!

14:30.604 --> 14:32.337
Okay, okay, you win.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.273
I'll teach you how
to make love to your wife!

14:35.275 --> 14:37.175
What? No!
Just cut her hair!

14:37.177 --> 14:38.843
Right.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.648
Homer, I thought
you were gonna quit.

14:43.650 --> 14:44.949
I can't.

14:44.951 --> 14:45.984
They won't let me.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.453
Lenny, be a pal and
saw off my hands.

14:48.455 --> 14:50.154
Why don't you do here
what you do

14:50.156 --> 14:52.657
at the nuclear plant--
namely, suck?

14:52.659 --> 14:54.092
Suck!

14:54.094 --> 14:55.393
Of course!

14:55.395 --> 14:56.594
So, I told Timothy

14:56.596 --> 15:00.965
you cannot keep basing sermons
on old<i> Seinfelds.</i>

15:03.904 --> 15:05.503
Oh, my God.

15:05.505 --> 15:08.172
Like Mozart and
Johnny Knoxville,

15:08.174 --> 15:10.141
my genius cannot be stopped!

15:10.143 --> 15:11.609
(sobbing)

15:11.611 --> 15:14.612
Oh, there's only one way out!

15:14.614 --> 15:16.948
I'm committing Barbicide!

15:20.387 --> 15:24.122
Oh, why doesn't anything
kill me?

15:28.261 --> 15:29.193
Hmm...

15:29.195 --> 15:30.595
Hey, that's Taffy's page.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.165
Ooh, I see that she's in
a relationship.

15:34.167 --> 15:34.599
Shut up.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.368
I just want to know what
she's up to with Milhouse.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.038
A girl like her could get
a fifth-grader,

15:40.040 --> 15:41.539
maybe even Kyle LoBianco!

15:41.541 --> 15:43.141
(Bart whistles appreciatively)

15:43.143 --> 15:45.944
I hear he goes to California
on his vacations.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.681
That's the first thing everyone
knows about Kyle LoBianco!

15:49.683 --> 15:50.481
Taffy's up to something.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.718
And I won't find out what it is,
sitting at a computer.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.555
It's time
to get boots on the ground.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.657
You like my boots?

15:59.659 --> 16:03.161
Once you get past
the sister ick,
they're fine.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.730
(Homer moans)

16:05.732 --> 16:09.434
Oh, my poor Homie.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.369
(moans)

16:11.371 --> 16:13.171
Marge, do you hear it?

16:13.173 --> 16:14.138
Listen!

16:14.140 --> 16:15.707
It's the hair... growing!

16:15.709 --> 16:16.607
Always growing!

16:16.609 --> 16:20.211
Blonde, brunette,
auburn!

16:20.213 --> 16:21.346
This ends now!

16:21.348 --> 16:23.614
I need some highlights
for a bridal shower!

16:23.616 --> 16:26.050
You can start with
the rinse! Shoo!

16:26.052 --> 16:27.752
(splutters) Please?!

16:27.754 --> 16:29.387
I'll even buy... product!

16:29.389 --> 16:31.322
(groans)

16:35.261 --> 16:37.762
(Milhouse wheezing)

16:37.764 --> 16:39.731
Here, my love.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.332
Thank you.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.035
Anything for
my silly Milly.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.604
(Milhouse giggles)

16:48.475 --> 16:50.375
Who'd follow Milhouse around
like that?

16:50.377 --> 16:53.511
Sneaking around after them
all day has taught me

16:53.513 --> 16:56.147
a<i> lot</i> about this sicko.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.582
Evening.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.417
(Lisa gasps)

17:03.256 --> 17:03.788
(sighs)

17:03.790 --> 17:07.458
I am never gonna get
my homework done tonight.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.604
All right, sister,
what's your game?

17:20.807 --> 17:21.773
We're just trying

17:21.775 --> 17:23.541
to put our relationship
back together.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.777
In the sack,
he's Salisbury steak,

17:25.779 --> 17:29.280
everywhere else, creamed corn.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.315
I am so sorry.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.651
(chuckles nervously)

17:34.788 --> 17:37.388
Lisa?

17:37.724 --> 17:39.690
Ugh!
Not her again.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.760
Yeah, Lisa,
can't you leave me alone?

17:42.762 --> 17:43.628
We're over.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.396
You're not over,
you never were!

17:45.398 --> 17:47.331
Milhouse,
you're a great guy,

17:47.333 --> 17:49.500
but we're not gonna work out
for one reason.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.103
Is it 'cause when
I wore cuffed pants

17:52.105 --> 17:53.438
they filled up
with leaves?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.840
That wasn't
a great day for us.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.777
But it's because you'll
always be in love with<i> her.</i>

17:59.779 --> 18:01.679
He likes his
apple pie warm

18:01.681 --> 18:03.514
and his
a la mode cold.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.849
Good luck.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.617
You don't want me
to be with you,

18:06.619 --> 18:08.853
you don't want me to be
with someone else.

18:08.855 --> 18:13.691
How miserable do I have
to be before you're happy?

18:15.161 --> 18:19.564
Milhouse, I, I... (groans)

18:20.233 --> 18:24.602
Lisa, does this mean
you like me?

18:24.604 --> 18:25.636
Yes. No!

18:25.638 --> 18:27.638
I don't know!
It means that...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.841
that life is full
of unexpected things

18:29.843 --> 18:31.509
and you should
never give up.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.478
And you're cute in
the moonlight.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.279
Aah!

18:37.150 --> 18:40.852
Everything's comin' up Milhouse!

18:44.724 --> 18:47.859
Doctor and Mrs.
Julius Hibbert!

18:47.861 --> 18:51.596
Mr. Discotheque Stuart,
unaccompanied!

18:51.598 --> 18:54.665
My girlfriend
isn't feeling well tonight.

18:54.667 --> 18:59.904
Krusty the Clown and
Disco Stu's girlfriend!

18:59.906 --> 19:04.742
Mr. Homer J. and Mrs. Marge
Bouvier Simpson!

19:05.845 --> 19:06.911
(all gasp)

19:06.913 --> 19:09.914
Her hair!

19:09.916 --> 19:12.617
Move over, Lard Lad statue,

19:12.619 --> 19:15.887
it's the eighth wonder
of the Springfield world!

19:15.889 --> 19:19.323
You've outdone
yourself, Homer!

19:19.726 --> 19:22.360
Oh, yes, ladies,
I've outdone myself.

19:22.362 --> 19:26.364
Outdone myself
by not doing it at all!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.899
Stop talking crazy talk!

19:27.901 --> 19:30.768
I'm afraid it's all too true.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.803
My wife has betrayed me...

19:32.805 --> 19:34.272
with another hairdresser!

19:34.274 --> 19:36.240
(all gasp)
Another hairdresser?

19:36.242 --> 19:37.241
Who is it?
We must know!

19:37.243 --> 19:41.712
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Julio is my little secret!

19:41.714 --> 19:43.347
(gasps)

19:43.349 --> 19:45.483
I've said too much!

19:45.485 --> 19:46.450
Julio?

19:46.452 --> 19:47.285
That's right, ladies.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.821
And I never heard a complaint I
didn't sympathetically cluck to.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.223
(clicking tongue)

19:52.225 --> 19:52.790
That's how I roll.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.426
Okay, first five customers
get a discount.

19:55.428 --> 19:58.663
Next five hear secrets
about the first five.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.964
Come on, get in line.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.766
(women squealing)

20:01.768 --> 20:02.800
It worked perfectly.

20:02.802 --> 20:06.804
As if anyone but you could
make me feel this beautiful.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.673
Aw, sweetie,
thanks for saving me

20:08.675 --> 20:10.341
from the horrible life

20:10.343 --> 20:13.477
Warren Beatty lived
in<i> Shampoo.</i>

20:13.479 --> 20:16.781
Now it's time
to pay you back.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.422
Oh... ooh...

20:24.424 --> 20:27.558
Homie, you're making
my toes curl.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.860
You sure know how
to please a woman.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.663
(chuckles)
As long as it doesn't

20:32.665 --> 20:37.735
involve losing weight
or changing my pants.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.619
Shh!
