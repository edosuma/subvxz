(Sydney)
'You said you want out
of the game.‘

00:04.670 --> 00:06.626
You want me to join you
in torturing my friends?

00:06.670 --> 00:08.638
You and whoever is on
the other end of that ear piece?

00:08.670 --> 00:10.365
(Ted)
I asked Ma/y
why she really came to see me.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.707
She told me we had
a child together.

00:11.740 --> 00:12.729
Charlotte?

00:12.770 --> 00:14.032
I ran a camp for troubled boys

00:14.080 --> 00:15.308
and Charles
was one of my campers.

00:15.340 --> 00:16.773
The other boy in this photo.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.175
Luke, Lucas maybe.

00:19.210 --> 00:20.643
I'm not playing, I just went.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.375
It's Aria's turn,
it's supposed to land on Aria.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.015
Did you sleep okay?
I'll go make us some coffee.

00:26.050 --> 00:27.244
Nicole's already asleep
upstairs.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.848
I don't know what
you've told her about us

00:28.890 --> 00:30.289
or what you haven't told her

00:30.330 --> 00:32.025
but she's gonna have a lot
of questions in the morning.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.379
(Spencer)
AD. stole Em/Yy’s eggs

00:33.430 --> 00:34.795
fe/t/Yized them,
and then used them

00:34.830 --> 00:36.127
to impregnate ,4/i.

00:40.270 --> 00:42.397
What are you gonna do?

00:43.610 --> 00:45.532
Are you talking about the game?

00:45.570 --> 00:48.733
No, I'm talking about you,
about the baby.

00:49.950 --> 00:52.077
What are you gonna do?

00:55.420 --> 00:58.139
What would you like me to do?

00:58.190 --> 01:00.317
It's not up to me.

01:02.790 --> 01:04.485
How do you feel?

01:06.760 --> 01:08.227
Um..

01:09.600 --> 01:12.068
I feel angry.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.658
I feel violated.

01:15.570 --> 01:17.128
How do you feel?

01:18.540 --> 01:21.008
I'm exhausted
from how angry I am.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.179
We should find out if it's true.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.336
It is true, Em.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.041
I know, but we could get
a blood test.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.378
You know, to be absolutely sure.

01:28.420 --> 01:29.569
Alright.

01:43.330 --> 01:45.469
[cellphone buzzing]

01:51.710 --> 01:54.531
Hello, Aria.

01:54.580 --> 01:57.572
I thought you'd appreciate
a friendly face.

01:57.610 --> 02:00.773
No more messengers,
no more go-betweens..

02:01.980 --> 02:04.039
...just you and me..

02:04.090 --> 02:05.489
...face to face.

02:06.490 --> 02:08.583
I want you
to understand something

02:08.620 --> 02:10.349
I will not hurt my friends.

02:10.390 --> 02:12.119
And I want you
to understand something

02:12.160 --> 02:14.253
you'll do as you're told.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.699
'Otherwise,
your friends will find out'

02:15.730 --> 02:18.460
'you're taking care
of numero uno.'

02:18.500 --> 02:20.422
Oh, and don't forget about Ezra.

02:20.470 --> 02:23.792
He's just a document away
from going to prison.

02:23.840 --> 02:24.795
What do you want?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.865
'I want the same thing
you want.'

02:26.910 --> 02:28.537
The end of the game.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.805
And that's what
we're gomg to accomplish..

02:34.180 --> 02:35.841
...together.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.713
Got a secret
can you keep It?

02:42.760 --> 02:45.126
Swear this one you'll save

02:45.160 --> 02:50.518
Better lock it in your pocket
taking this one to the grave

02:50.570 --> 02:52.492
If I show you
then I know

02:52.530 --> 02:55.294
You won't tell what I said

02:55.340 --> 03:00.562
Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead

03:04.650 --> 03:06.402
(Spencer)
'What happened at the clinic?'

03:06.450 --> 03:07.747
When we explained the situation

03:07.780 --> 03:09.919
they said they'd rush
the blood test.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.815
You explained things?

03:12.520 --> 03:14.511
Sort of explained.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.117
What do we think this means?

03:17.160 --> 03:18.286
It means that the world is much

03:18.330 --> 03:20.127
smaller than we ever thought.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.525
Lucas lied to us

03:21.560 --> 03:23.289
he said he didn't know anything
about Charlotte.

03:23.330 --> 03:24.399
Maybe he didn't

03:24.430 --> 03:26.022
maybe he was friends with a boy

03:26.070 --> 03:27.822
named Charles a long time ago.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.667
Or maybe it was more
than one summer.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.237
Maybe they stayed friends
at Radley

03:32.270 --> 03:34.204
and what happened after that..

03:34.240 --> 03:36.970
No, no, not Lucas.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.773
If there's one thing
we should all know by now

03:38.810 --> 03:40.949
it's that not everybody
tells you everything.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.317
Pastor Ted might not be
the only one

03:44.350 --> 03:45.840
who kept a souvenir
of that summer.

03:45.890 --> 03:49.280
I-if Lucas stayed in touch
with Charles and then Charlotte

03:49.320 --> 03:52.323
maybe there's a trail.
And we should look.

03:52.360 --> 03:55.488
That loft was
a techno death trap, remember?

03:55.530 --> 03:57.919
I-it might be filled
with bugs and cameras.

03:57.970 --> 04:01.326
Well, if it is, Lucas already
knows all of our secrets.

04:01.370 --> 04:03.668
— So we search.
— Discreetly.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.507
You guys are wrong about him.

04:06.710 --> 04:09.235
I can't believe
she was in that house.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.804
Mary.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.340
Whole time we were talking
to Pastor Ted

04:12.380 --> 04:13.904
she was just fifteen,
twenty feet away.

04:13.950 --> 04:15.474
[cellphone buzzing]

04:16.790 --> 04:18.985
— I gotta go.
— Yeah, me too.

04:19.020 --> 04:21.352
— I'll help you after school.
- Okay.

04:22.390 --> 04:23.857
— Bye.
— Bye.

04:34.870 --> 04:36.360
Cupcakes.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.461
Gluten free, dairy free,
sugar free, fat free

04:40.510 --> 04:42.728
technically,
they might not actually exist.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.704
If there is anything
in that box, I'll be happy.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.001
[chuckles]

04:48.620 --> 04:52.386
— I'm trying to reach Toby.
- Uh, he's with Caleb.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.651
Toby has a cabin, so they
went up there to fish or..

04:57.430 --> 04:58.920
...to not fish.

04:58.960 --> 05:01.554
Not fishing
can be very relaxing.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.964
Um, so I understand
that you found a finger.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.309
No, I didn't find it,
it was sent to me.

05:12.340 --> 05:13.602
Okay, well,
so much for Archer Dunhill

05:13.640 --> 05:15.278
being out of the country.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.470
Or alive.

05:16.510 --> 05:18.649
So what do you think happened?

05:20.550 --> 05:22.108
I talked to a nurse at Welby.

05:22.150 --> 05:25.449
She told me that Drake
and your friend Emily Fields

05:25.490 --> 05:26.809
visited Alison.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.454
Dr. Rollins
wasn't too happy about it.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.822
Mary Drake and Rollins argued.

05:31.860 --> 05:33.623
Because if they were
working together

05:33.660 --> 05:35.321
and things went south
between them

05:35.360 --> 05:38.124
that argument may be the reason
Dr. Rollins disappeared.

05:38.170 --> 05:43.130
So the theory is that Mary Drake
killed Rollins, Dunhill.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.831
That's one theory.

05:47.410 --> 05:50.538
Can I, uh,
can I ask you a question?

05:51.180 --> 05:52.943
Sure.

05:52.980 --> 05:55.540
When you asked me
to look for Mary Drake

05:55.580 --> 05:57.548
did you think
that she was involved with

05:57.590 --> 05:59.046
what happened
with Archer Dunhill?

05:59.090 --> 06:00.387
No.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.314
I guess that wouldn't make sense
you asking me to look for

06:03.360 --> 06:06.784
your birth mother if you thought
she was involved in his death.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.555
I didn't know that he was dead
when I asked you.

06:11.430 --> 06:13.091
That's right, you didn't.

06:18.710 --> 06:21.406
Thank you for the cupcakes.

06:21.440 --> 06:22.998
You're welcome.

06:25.050 --> 06:28.178
(Ezra)
'No, no, remember we talked
to Dr. Randall'

06:28.220 --> 06:30.142
'about that before you left.‘

06:31.420 --> 06:33.479
'Right.'

06:33.520 --> 06:37.286
Alright, yeah, no, no,
I'll give him a call.

06:37.330 --> 06:41.528
No, it's-it's okay, it's okay,
just say hi to Nicole for me.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.052
Okay.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.695
— Nicole's dad?
— Nicole's...dad.

06:49.570 --> 06:51.333
How are they?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.668
They want me to come back.

06:53.710 --> 06:56.804
— Nicole does?
— Her parents.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.511
Then I can't imagine
what they're going through.

07:02.550 --> 07:05.940
Uh, they're happy,
they're-they're nervous.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.515
They're treating her like
she's made out of glass and..

07:10.020 --> 07:13.387
Um, I was on my way out
to run a few errands, but, um..

07:13.430 --> 07:15.057
...I'll be back in an hour.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.419
Yeah.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.094
Are you okay?

07:20.500 --> 07:21.967
Yeah.

07:29.340 --> 07:32.468
[cellphone buzzing]

07:43.220 --> 07:47.782
Rule number one,
never send me to voice mail.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.088
What do you want?

07:52.130 --> 07:54.724
You talked to your friends
this morning.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.238
What was that all about?

07:57.270 --> 07:58.567
Nothing.

07:58.610 --> 08:01.568
Mm, you know, Aria

08:01.610 --> 08:04.135
trust is a two—way street.

08:04.180 --> 08:05.909
You wanna live
happily ever after?

08:05.950 --> 08:08.771
I need to know
you've got my back.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.311
Otherwise, the prince
goes back to the tower

08:11.350 --> 08:14.683
and there's no fairytale wedding
for the princess.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.813
Why are you doing this?

08:16.860 --> 08:19.624
What do you think
you'll get out of it?

08:19.660 --> 08:21.218
Everything.

08:22.700 --> 08:24.918
Now, let's try this again.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.188
What were Hanna and Spencer
doing the other day

08:27.240 --> 08:28.832
when they left town?

08:31.910 --> 08:34.799
They were looking
for Mary Drake.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.172
They didn't find her.

08:37.210 --> 08:38.677
But they found something.

08:39.810 --> 08:41.949
I can tell by your eyes.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.039
'Don't push your luck, Aria.'

08:46.090 --> 08:47.614
'Not with me.'

08:48.890 --> 08:51.552
They found the place
she hid for a few days.

08:53.360 --> 08:55.180
And?

08:55.230 --> 08:59.189
And...they talked
to Charlotte's father.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.797
[dramatic music]

09:09.180 --> 09:12.900
God, she trusted that man
and now she's having his baby.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.176
What a nightmare.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.114
Yeah, it is.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.021
I feel sorry for her.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.757
I do.

09:29.260 --> 09:33.196
We were all taking turns,
you know, keeping an eye on her

09:33.230 --> 09:35.232
just to...be there.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.800
Sure, I get it.
That makes sense.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.007
Thank you for understanding.

09:49.450 --> 09:52.214
[bell rings]

09:52.250 --> 09:54.514
I'll talk to you at lunch?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.016
Yeah.

09:57.260 --> 09:59.182
[cellphone rings]

10:02.100 --> 10:03.397
Ali?

10:03.430 --> 10:06.365
Congratulations,
you're a mother.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.630
The blood test?

10:08.670 --> 10:09.898
It's you and me.

10:14.110 --> 10:15.668
It's not just the two of us.

10:15.710 --> 10:18.429
There was someone else involved.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.345
(Alison)
'Or it wasn't Dunhill.‘

10:20.380 --> 10:25.317
It's the wrong blood type,
so that narrows it down to..

10:26.520 --> 10:28.215
...couple million.

10:30.320 --> 10:34.620
- 'Hey, you still there?‘
— Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.260
What are you thinking?

10:40.670 --> 10:42.797
I'm not thinking at all
right now.

[dramatic music]

11:23.480 --> 11:25.402
[music continues]

11:38.090 --> 11:40.354
Why do they always have
such big arms?

11:40.390 --> 11:42.620
How can they even put on spandex
with these things?

11:42.660 --> 11:44.958
Hanna, don't browse, search.

11:46.330 --> 11:49.595
— Lucas wouldn't hurt us.
— Then let's prove It.

11:49.640 --> 11:50.993
Anything in the pictures?

11:51.040 --> 11:53.167
Lots of photos from Comic Con.

11:57.110 --> 12:00.807
So, what are you gonna do,
about the baby?

12:00.850 --> 12:02.977
I'll do whatever
Ali wants to do.

12:03.020 --> 12:07.184
Well, those blood tests give you
a pretty big stake in this.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.381
What's in those boxes
under there?

12:18.930 --> 12:21.091
Surprise, comic books.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.759
What are you even looking for?

12:24.810 --> 12:26.903
We'll know when we find it.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.429
I was such a cute baby.

12:33.110 --> 12:35.670
What? _
I was, my mom has pictures.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.985
I've seen pictures of Caleb
when he was a little kid too.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.443
I think we can make
something pretty good together.

12:41.490 --> 12:44.015
It's not like making a lasagna.

12:44.060 --> 12:46.221
Okay, I'm just saying,
I've been thinking about it.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.897
A lot lately.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.891
— What's that?
— What's what?

12:52.930 --> 12:54.693
I mean, all these comics
are wrapped in plastic.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.332
"Arcturus."

13:04.380 --> 13:05.847
Hanna"

13:08.480 --> 13:10.414
[dramatic music]

13:14.260 --> 13:16.956
So I took your suggestion
about other patients

13:16.990 --> 13:19.129
who might have known
that Dunhill was a fraud.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.521
Did it lead anywhere?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.427
Most people I talked to weren't
available to commit the crime.

13:26.470 --> 13:28.097
And the others would have
preferred he stayed alive

13:28.140 --> 13:29.937
so they could sue him.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.202
When you say weren't available..

13:33.240 --> 13:34.229
I'm pretty sure
that Dunhill was killed

13:34.280 --> 13:35.804
the day he left the hospital.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.933
Same day your friends
went by Welby to complain about

13:37.980 --> 13:40.244
how Dr. _Rol|ins
was treating you.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.168
You have very devoted friends.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.644
So, you think he was killed
that night, after he left town?

13:46.690 --> 13:49.557
Well, his coat left town and
his phone and his credit cards

13:49.590 --> 13:52.753
but I don't think Archer Dunhill
was in any condition to use 'em.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.453
If somebody wanted you to think
he was alive, why would they..

13:56.500 --> 13:58.695
...send you part of him?

13:58.730 --> 14:01.858
See, that is a good question.

14:01.900 --> 14:04.767
Why go through so much trouble
to make us think he's alive

14:04.810 --> 14:07.665
and deliver us proof
that he wasn't?

14:07.710 --> 14:10.929
It only makes sense if there was
more than one person involved.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.878
You think... _
two people were responSIble

14:14.920 --> 14:16.273
for whatever happened to him?

14:17.150 --> 14:21.041
Two, three, maybe four.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.682
And the more people
involved in the crime

14:22.720 --> 14:24.551
'the more likely that someone's
gonna get nervous'

14:24.590 --> 14:26.558
'and look for an out
for themselves.‘

14:26.590 --> 14:30.094
Somebody does not want
Archer Dunhill to stay buried.

14:32.700 --> 14:35.589
Would you like a cupcake?
There're gluten free.

14:36.740 --> 14:37.934
No, thank you.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.904
(Emily)
'The hero's this boy who gets
picked on by other kids'

14:41.940 --> 14:43.635
'and by his own family.‘

14:43.680 --> 14:45.204
(Hanna)
'And then he meets
this alien woman in the woods'

14:45.250 --> 14:46.603
and she becomes his protector.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.299
And she's this
all powerful shape shifter

14:48.350 --> 14:49.840
'who helps get revenge
for the boy.‘

14:49.880 --> 14:50.915
(Hanna)
'Torturing his enemies.‘

14:50.950 --> 14:51.939
And sometimes the boy

14:51.990 --> 14:53.139
turns into Arcturus

14:53.190 --> 14:54.418
so he can experience the payback

14:54.460 --> 14:56.052
she gets for him.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.979
You don't have to be four
to figure this one out.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.986
Lucas and Charles
made this together?

15:01.030 --> 15:02.793
Yes, and Lucas kept it.

15:02.830 --> 15:04.195
He's connected to Charlotte.

15:04.230 --> 15:06.095
He was there
when this whole thing started.

15:06.130 --> 15:08.360
He's done way more
than he's ever said.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.831
Does this mean Lucas is A.D.?

15:13.870 --> 15:15.406
Well, it's possible.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.874
That means something else
is possible.

15:17.910 --> 15:19.707
Ali's baby.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.900
No, no.

15:21.950 --> 15:24.441
No one says anything
about this to Ali.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.248

15:57.620 --> 15:59.281
(A.D.)
'You saw this book yourself?‘

15:59.320 --> 16:02.517
Yes, Emily and Hanna called me
when they found it.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.619
Where is it now?

16:04.660 --> 16:06.150
They put it back.

16:08.430 --> 16:11.558
Is that you, Lucas?
Are you under all that?

16:13.300 --> 16:14.392
[laughs]

16:14.440 --> 16:16.465
Would I tell you if I was?

16:17.770 --> 16:19.704
'You're a good spy, Aria.'

16:19.740 --> 16:22.470
Now let's see
what kind of thief you are.

16:24.950 --> 16:27.976
[music continues]

16:32.650 --> 16:34.288
No. No more.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.059
Or maybe just a splash.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.027
I can't tell you what to do.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.262
I didn't come here for you
to tell me what to do.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.808
[sighs]
Okay.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.331
What am I gonna do?

16:57.380 --> 17:02.101
Don't ask my advice,
please just...flip a coin.

17:02.150 --> 17:04.345
'You'll have a_better shot
at happiness.'

17:07.560 --> 17:11.087
I don't have a right
to ask her to have the baby.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.452
She says I do but...I don't.

17:17.160 --> 17:19.424
Not until we know
who the father is.

17:19.470 --> 17:22.769
She might not know that
in time to decide.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.665
We may never know.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.507
Just makes me so mad

17:26.540 --> 17:28.906
that somebody did this to her.

17:28.940 --> 17:31.101
They did it to you too.

17:41.090 --> 17:44.548
I just keep thinking
about that letter.

17:44.590 --> 17:47.081
'The letter that Mary Drake
wrote before you were born.‘

17:48.960 --> 17:53.420
All the pain and...regret.

17:53.470 --> 17:56.166
You could feel it
coming off the page.

18:01.640 --> 18:05.406
I don't ever want
to write a letter like that.

18:18.930 --> 18:21.854
[intense music]

18:49.320 --> 18:50.787
How are you feeling?

18:52.360 --> 18:54.385
Pretty good..

18:56.260 --> 18:58.194
'...I think.'

19:02.470 --> 19:05.132
Ali, I want you
to have the baby.

19:06.670 --> 19:10.401
I know I'm asking you more than
I have the right to ask, but..

19:12.210 --> 19:14.405
...but I want a chance
to raise this child.

19:20.190 --> 19:23.318
[instrumental music]

19:24.930 --> 19:27.319
We don't even know
who the father is.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.893
We know who the father isn't.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.938
Look, whoever did this to us

19:38.970 --> 19:40.858
I don't want them to win.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.276
You think that's a good enough
reason to have a baby?

19:43.310 --> 19:46.279
No. No, that's not
my only reason.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.818
Ali, I understand if you can't.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.451
Okay, but just promise me that
you'll at least think about it.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.827
I promise.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.198
What do you mean it's gone?

20:06.230 --> 20:08.494
What do you think I mean?
It's gone.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.235
It's not in the place
where we left it.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.033
'Whoever took it knew
where to look.'

20:12.070 --> 20:14.265
Okay, well,
that brings us back to Lucas.

20:14.310 --> 20:15.868
He's on a retreat.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.504
Yeah, at least that's
what his office told you.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.370
Spencer, we keep falling behind.

20:20.410 --> 20:21.900
Alright, we have
to find something

20:21.950 --> 20:23.770
that will give us an edge.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.469
Drink some decaf,
go back to the loft

20:25.520 --> 20:27.078
and wait for Emily to come home.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.781
'Not much of a plan.‘

20:28.820 --> 20:31.152
Yeah, well, that's all
I've got right now. Later.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.329
[sighs]
Later.

20:43.340 --> 20:46.264
[key clatters]

20:46.310 --> 20:49.438
[instrumental music]

20:51.950 --> 20:53.406
Did you know about this?

20:55.580 --> 20:57.275
No, but I don't even know
what it is.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.982
It's a real estate listing
for our factory space.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.089
It's what?

21:01.120 --> 21:02.189
All that talk about Lucas

21:02.220 --> 21:03.551
backing you all the way

21:03.590 --> 21:05.217
that's all it was, talk.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.682
He put the factory up for sale.

21:06.730 --> 21:08.129
He's selling your business
out from under you

21:08.160 --> 21:09.559
before we've even started.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.262
— Lucas did this?
— The contact's his office.

21:13.330 --> 21:14.922
I underestimated him.

21:14.970 --> 21:16.699
He's as snealq as I am.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.537
I have to show you something

21:19.570 --> 21:21.868
but you cannot tell anyone.

[music continues]

[door squeaks]

22:33.410 --> 22:36.117
Ali decides to have the baby

22:36.150 --> 22:37.811
and we'll tell people the truth

22:37.850 --> 22:41.388
about how it's not really
Dunhill's, and it's mine.

22:42.390 --> 22:44.210
Half mine.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.785
Yours and Allison's.

22:46.830 --> 22:49.025
She didn't ask to be
a part of this.

22:50.230 --> 22:53.028
And I don't want to force her.

22:53.070 --> 22:54.526
It's what I want.

22:57.370 --> 23:00.134
Allison is having your baby.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.479
She hasn't made up her mind yet.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.644
Where are you going?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.216
I'm buying the next round.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.787
And probably the one after that.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.422
- Oh, my.
- You'd wanna hurry.

23:19.460 --> 23:21.485
I don't know how long
she'll be gone.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.223
Caleb already did that.
He didn't hear anything.

23:25.270 --> 23:28.262
That's because he didn't know
what to listen for.

23:28.300 --> 23:30.666
I can't hear a fan but..

23:31.940 --> 23:34.408
...I can feel where it's warm

23:34.440 --> 23:35.839
where the batteries are.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.735
Batteries? _
I thought it ran on bitchiness.

23:38.780 --> 23:40.645
It has a finite amount of power.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.945
Like one of those rovers
you send to Mars.

23:43.980 --> 23:45.379
You're going to have
to finish the game

23:45.420 --> 23:47.149
before the batteries
can run down.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.990
Touchy, isn't it?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.530
Mona, I brought you here
to help me

24:03.570 --> 24:05.765
not to admire the craftsmanship.

24:05.810 --> 24:07.766
My turn is next.
We have to shut this thing down.

24:07.810 --> 24:10.870
I understand that, Hanna,
but sometimes you have to stop

24:10.910 --> 24:13.799
and admire the craft
behind the dirty tricks.

24:13.850 --> 24:17.115
[sighs]
I wish I could've built
something like this.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.139
You do?

24:18.190 --> 24:19.418
Think about the mind

24:19.450 --> 24:21.042
that conceived this.

when you can turn'

into a dollhouse?

It's brilliant.

24:28.030 --> 24:31.227

It's beautiful.

Who am I if I stay?

24:52.520 --> 24:54.488
Nobody wanted this.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.454
Somebody did.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.651
He just never asked any of us.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.691
Hey, can we just try
and make this work?

25:03.730 --> 25:07.120
You know, you and me and Ali?

25:08.570 --> 25:10.936
Everyone would be miserable.

25:10.970 --> 25:13.609
You think we'd be all
post modern in let century

25:13.640 --> 25:16.279
but...it would not
be like that.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.778
- And you know it.
— Yeah, we could try.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.947
I've learnt_ so much
from lovmg you.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.379
One of the most important things

25:24.420 --> 25:26.615
you taught me
is not to get greedy.

25:31.660 --> 25:34.220
[sighs]
Now you have to listen to me.

25:36.100 --> 25:38.728
This is the third time
I said goodbye to you.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.969
I'm never going to
say it again.

25:43.940 --> 25:44.793
[sighs]

25:44.840 --> 25:47.001
Hold on

25:48.880 --> 25:50.871
I have to do this.

25:53.050 --> 25:55.177
Of course you do.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.108
That's what make you Emily.

Stay strong

This is where we find out
who we are

Lift your eyes
and count the stars

Why are you packed?

Everything's okay,
uh, Nicole's parents

27:46.960 --> 27:48.279
want me to come to Maine.

27:48.330 --> 27:50.321
If everything's okay,
why are you packed?

27:50.360 --> 27:51.850
They just need somebody
to talk to the doctor

27:51.900 --> 27:53.390
and they don't like
their new one.

27:53.430 --> 27:55.762
Okay, can't you just call
the doctor on the phone?

27:55.800 --> 27:57.358
It's-it's easier this way.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.867
Easier?

27:58.910 --> 28:00.935
To pack a bag, go to the airport

28:00.970 --> 28:03.768
get on a plane and rent a car
on the other side?

28:03.810 --> 28:06.142
They asked me to come.

28:08.980 --> 28:11.778
Ezra, do you honestly believe
that whatever's happening there

28:11.820 --> 28:13.947
her parents can't handle it?

28:13.990 --> 28:15.309
This is just for right now.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.987
What happens next time?

28:17.020 --> 28:18.453
What happens
after we're married?

28:18.490 --> 28:21.288
I am just trying to figure
my way through today.

28:21.330 --> 28:24.788
— So am I.
— I'll be back in two days.

28:24.830 --> 28:27.094
I don't want you to come back,
I want you to stay.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.563
You're putting me
in the middle here.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.659
No, you're in the middle.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.497
I did not put you there.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.360
You're not the only one
struggling through this.

28:34.410 --> 28:36.833
You don't know
what I've done for us.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.404
What I've done for you.

28:40.150 --> 28:41.742
Aria, what Nicole went through

28:41.780 --> 28:43.839
was the worst thing
in the world.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.973
And she survived,
and when she came back

28:46.020 --> 28:48.079
her whole world was different,
that's not fair.

28:48.120 --> 28:49.815
It's not something you can fix.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.010
— I'm not trying to fix it.
— Yes, you are.

28:52.060 --> 28:54.551
And I know this because I spent
my life trying to fix things.

28:54.590 --> 28:56.694
I know how it can make things
worse instead of better.

28:56.730 --> 28:58.652
We're talking about two days.

28:58.700 --> 28:59.997
[sighs]

29:05.870 --> 29:07.167
Ezra, I love you.

29:08.640 --> 29:10.335
I helped you write that book so

29:10.380 --> 29:13.577
I know something
about how you feel.

29:13.610 --> 29:16.977
— You think you owe Nicole.
— This isn't about Nicole.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.671
This is about me trying
to look at myself

29:19.720 --> 29:21.187
in the mirror in the morning.

29:21.220 --> 29:24.656
Aria, uh, I, I can't make
anymore mistakes, okay?

29:24.690 --> 29:27.750
I need to figure out how to
make this right for everybody.

29:27.790 --> 29:29.894
Then stay.

29:29.930 --> 29:33.525
Make things right. Here. Now.

29:33.570 --> 29:36.221
We'll figure this out
when I get back.

29:36.270 --> 29:39.501
— Ezra.
— Please, when I get back.

29:56.290 --> 29:59.157
I knocked. The door was open.

29:59.190 --> 30:01.329
You should watch that.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.793
[crickets chirping]

30:05.830 --> 30:07.889
[cellphone buzzes]

30:15.010 --> 30:16.807
[door creaks]

30:19.580 --> 30:21.946
[footsteps approaching]

30:22.620 --> 30:25.111
[intense music]

30:25.720 --> 30:27.347
Hello, Spencer.

30:29.390 --> 30:31.585
I was coming over to your place

30:31.630 --> 30:33.325
I saw you leave the barn.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.591
— You followed me?
— Yes.

30:36.630 --> 30:39.622
You saw that I was going
some place and you followed me?

30:39.670 --> 30:41.194
'That's right.‘

30:41.230 --> 30:43.460
And then you waited
outside for an hour?

30:43.500 --> 30:45.991
Fifty-eight minutes.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.735
Doesn't that seem
a little odd to you?

30:47.770 --> 30:50.477
Oh, I've got a whole list
of things that seem odd to me

30:50.510 --> 30:52.137
about this case.

30:52.180 --> 30:53.374
Who are you supposed
to meet here?

30:53.410 --> 30:55.640
No one.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.478
You asked me _
to help you once and I did.

30:58.520 --> 31:00.181
Hell, I was glad to.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.744
But things have changed.

31:01.790 --> 31:03.041
If this snowball keeps going

31:03.090 --> 31:04.648
there is nothing
I can do to help you.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.783
What snowball are we discussing?

31:06.830 --> 31:09.151
Every theory
that I can come up with

31:09.200 --> 31:10.849
to figure out what happened
to Archer Dunhill

31:10.900 --> 31:12.356
keeps circling back to you

31:12.400 --> 31:15.221
and Alison and your friends,
especially to you.

31:15.270 --> 31:16.692
Why especially to me?

31:16.740 --> 31:18.833
Like everybody else,
you're connected to Dunhill

31:18.870 --> 31:20.599
through Alison

31:20.640 --> 31:23.131
but you have two connections..

31:23.180 --> 31:24.909
...you have Mary Drake.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.272
I think I'm gonna go home now.

31:29.380 --> 31:32.076
Did you know
that Dunhill was at the bar?

31:32.120 --> 31:33.917
The Radley Bar,
the same night that we were.

31:33.950 --> 31:35.611
The night he disappeared.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.912
No.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.518
How did you know
that he was there?

31:39.560 --> 31:42.358
Maybe he wasn't after all
but his credit card was.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.153
Same card used to buy
the train ticket.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.327
'I finally got
the statement today.‘

31:47.370 --> 31:48.792
— I didn't order this.
— He did.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.263
- What were you doin' tonight?
— Burying a body.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.064
Check please, this one's on me.

31:54.110 --> 31:57.238
[dramatic music]

32:03.220 --> 32:05.643
'I've requested paper receipts
from the hotel.‘

32:05.690 --> 32:07.681
'I'm interested in seeing
the signature on that bill.'

32:07.720 --> 32:10.587
Once that happens,
there's gonna be more questions.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.009
And that's something
I can't control.

32:13.060 --> 32:14.584
'Do you understand?‘

32:16.430 --> 32:17.692
Can I go now?

32:18.900 --> 32:20.561
I can't stop you.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.298
[door creaks]

32:30.080 --> 32:31.729
You don't
have to leave Rosewood.

32:31.780 --> 32:34.374
That's what everybody
keeps telling me.

32:35.150 --> 32:37.038
But it's time to go.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.945
'Time to do something else.‘

32:39.920 --> 32:41.581
I got what I came for.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.247
Not what I thought
I was gonna get

32:43.290 --> 32:46.327
but it's what
I'm supposed to have.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.558
I'm sorry you're going
through a hard time.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.460
Thanks.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.830
I don't wanna make this
any tougher

32:57.870 --> 32:59.565
but before I go

32:59.610 --> 33:01.908
there's something
I need to know.

33:01.940 --> 33:03.407
What?

33:04.710 --> 33:06.439
Do you love her?

33:06.480 --> 33:08.675
— Do I love--
— Emily.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.779
Do you love her?

33:10.820 --> 33:13.448
I'm the last person
you should ask about love.

33:14.820 --> 33:18.756
Maybe, but you're the only one
who can answer the question.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.826
You know Emily loves you.

33:20.860 --> 33:23.590
Maybe you've known all along
and that scares you.

33:23.630 --> 33:26.428
'That's what made you scared
and such a terrible person.‘

33:26.970 --> 33:28.267
Sorry.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.689
Person who sometimes
did terrible things.

33:30.740 --> 33:32.867
I was terrible.

33:32.910 --> 33:35.037
Sometimes I still am.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.036
That's why you can't ask me that

33:37.080 --> 33:39.640
about Emily.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.740
You find it so hard
to be honest with yourself.

33:42.780 --> 33:45.476
I guess you don't have
a lot of practice with that.

33:45.520 --> 33:46.680
Not really.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.115
People don't like the truth.

33:50.160 --> 33:52.116
The truth is slippery.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.980
Can't depend on it.

33:54.030 --> 33:56.521
Try it. Just for a minute.

34:01.770 --> 34:03.328
[sighs]

34:05.640 --> 34:09.030
I know how I feel
when she looks at me.

34:10.710 --> 34:13.042
I've never felt that
with anyone before.

34:14.910 --> 34:16.468
[sighs]

34:17.950 --> 34:20.487
It's like..

34:20.520 --> 34:22.715
...she sees who you really are.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.155
Maybe that's the scariest part.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.996
You look at her..

34:32.030 --> 34:34.692
You look at,
you look at her eyes..

34:36.670 --> 34:39.059
And you wanna be
worth the effort.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.405
You wanna be the person
she sees.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.268
Thanks for the water.

34:55.390 --> 34:58.188
I didn't answer your question.

34:58.220 --> 35:00.256
But you didn't lie to me.

35:00.290 --> 35:03.088
Old Ali might have, just
to get me out of the house.

35:03.860 --> 35:06.124
[instrumental music]

35:12.970 --> 35:14.437
Ali.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.269
You're gonna have
a beautiful baby.

35:20.250 --> 35:23.208
[music continues]

35:23.250 --> 35:24.877
[door opens]

35:26.290 --> 35:27.484
[door closes]

35:30.720 --> 35:33.553
Rails, pulleys and magnets
make the pieces move.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.251
It's probably not listening
all the time

35:35.300 --> 35:36.779
that would drain too much power.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.390
You think we should cover
the camera on the phone?

35:39.430 --> 35:42.263
That would just
make someone angry.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.597
How do we open it?

35:43.640 --> 35:46.131
When the thing was closed,
it was sealed.

35:46.170 --> 35:49.264
Whoever made it probably can't
get into it now, it..

35:49.310 --> 35:51.232
There is poetry to that.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.374
When the game ends,
the game dies.

35:54.410 --> 35:56.605
Do you think Lucas made this?

35:56.650 --> 35:59.448
I mean, he knows all about
games and computers.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.446
It's not a game or a computer.

36:01.490 --> 36:02.809
There's electronics in it

36:02.860 --> 36:06.114
but the heart
of the thing is mechanical.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.321
It was lovingly handmade.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.155
Mona, you have to help me
play this game.

36:13.470 --> 36:16.428
— Do what?
— Play the game and win.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.463
Why me?

36:19.510 --> 36:20.761
Because you are the only person

36:20.810 --> 36:23.438
who isn't afraid of it.
You admire it.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.129
You can get inside the head
of whoever made this.

36:25.180 --> 36:27.341
The reason I'm not afraid of it
is because you don't see

36:27.380 --> 36:29.007
a little Mona
at that starting line.

36:29.050 --> 36:31.939
— Mona, please.
— Don't ask me to do this.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.613
Mona, I am begging you.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.389
You are the only one
who knows what it's like

36:38.420 --> 36:39.819
to make something like this.

36:39.860 --> 36:41.452
Yes, I do.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.492
And that's why I can't touch it.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.961
Playing with people's
lives like this..

36:48.430 --> 36:49.795
...it's an addiction.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.489
'You're not dealing
with a healthy person'

36:51.540 --> 36:53.394
'you're dealing with an addict.‘

36:53.440 --> 36:57.706
I know. I know more about it
than I ever wanted to.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.201
Well, then imagine how
you'll feel when you beat it.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.518

— Hey.
— Hey.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.686
Hey, um, I-I don't think
you've ever met Wren Kingston.

37:40.720 --> 37:43.518
— No.
— Wren, this is Ezra Fitz.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.982
— Ezra, Wren.
— Hello.

37:45.020 --> 37:46.180
Pleasure.

37:46.230 --> 37:48.323
Uh, Wren was almost
my brother-in-law.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.657
— A couple of times.
- Yeah.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.429
I ended up
with a layover from hell

37:51.460 --> 37:52.893
called Spencer
and she was gracious enough

37:52.930 --> 37:55.364
to come and share
the pain with me.

37:55.400 --> 37:58.039
— Are you going someplace?
— Ah, y-yes.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.038
Well, I, I was.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.459
Well, have a drink with us.

38:02.510 --> 38:03.602
Oh, no. No, thanks.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.471
Uh, you two are catching up

38:05.510 --> 38:06.909
and I don't wanna intrude

38:06.950 --> 38:08.906
but listen,
it was great meeting you.

38:08.950 --> 38:10.019
Same.

38:10.980 --> 38:12.311
Spencen

38:12.350 --> 38:13.817
Yeah, bye.

38:16.190 --> 38:18.055
Ezra.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.058
Hey, um..

38:20.090 --> 38:22.729
— I have to ask you a favor.
- Sure, anything.

38:22.760 --> 38:26.218
I haven't seen Wren since
before Charlotte was killed.

38:26.270 --> 38:28.795
And he helped her
sneak into Radley

38:28.840 --> 38:31.138
and I wanted to see
if he remembered something

38:31.170 --> 38:33.968
that would help us, but so far
it's just been nothing.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.331
Do you think that we could
keep this between us?

38:37.440 --> 38:39.078
Keep w-what between us?

38:39.110 --> 38:42.238
That you saw him here with me.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.508
Who would I tell?

38:43.550 --> 38:45.142
I just really wouldn't want
Detective Furey

38:45.180 --> 38:47.489
to find out about this.

38:47.520 --> 38:50.409
— Alright.
— Thank you.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.951
— Of course.
— Have a safe flight.

38:52.990 --> 38:54.457
Yeah.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.456
Ali?

39:01.870 --> 39:02.894
Hey.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.838
What's wrong?

39:10.610 --> 39:11.634
I've thought about it..

39:11.680 --> 39:13.375
And I'm straining to..

39:13.410 --> 39:14.877
About what it means..

39:16.680 --> 39:18.978
About what it could mean.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.945
I'm going to have the baby.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.783
— Are you sure?
— No.

39:28.830 --> 39:32.493
I see_the candle
burning down..

39:32.530 --> 39:35.567
— But if you help me..
— I'll help you.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.398
Before my wild eyes..

39:38.440 --> 39:39.737
Okay.

39:39.770 --> 39:42.159
I feel you holding..

39:42.210 --> 39:43.359
Then it's settled..

39:43.410 --> 39:46.208
Tighter I cannot see..

39:46.250 --> 39:47.899
I'll do it.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.475
We will do it.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.509
Together.

39:51.550 --> 39:54.041
Breathe

39:54.090 --> 39:55.614
Thank you.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.056
Thank you..

40:00.360 --> 40:01.429
...for trusting me.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.724
Breathe

40:04.700 --> 40:10.991
Breathe

40:12.210 --> 40:15.668
Breathe breathe..

40:15.710 --> 40:18.031
There will be
more flights tomorrow

40:18.080 --> 40:19.570
I suppose.

40:21.550 --> 40:22.847
I suppose.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.445
Ezra, I'm sorry
about what I said.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.883
Well, I'm sorry
about how it came out.

40:33.930 --> 40:36.421
I feel the pages turning..

40:36.460 --> 40:38.223
[sighs]

40:38.260 --> 40:40.524
But I'm afraid.

40:40.570 --> 40:44.688
We're so close and I'm just..

40:44.740 --> 40:47.538
I'm afraid
of it all falling apart.

40:48.440 --> 40:49.805
I feel you..

40:49.840 --> 40:51.876
— So maybe I wasn't-—
— No, you were right.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.400
And I, I needed to hear that.

40:53.450 --> 40:55.270
Cannot see

40:55.310 --> 40:57.449
When will we finally..

40:57.480 --> 40:59.744
My flight wasn't cancelled.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.940
I just didn't get on it.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.720
[cellphone buzzing]

41:09.760 --> 41:13.321
Breathe

41:13.370 --> 41:17.397
Breathe

41:17.440 --> 41:19.931
[bottle rattling]

41:20.710 --> 41:23.736
Breathe

41:23.780 --> 41:26.738
Breathe

41:26.780 --> 41:29.578
Breathe

41:29.620 --> 41:32.748
[instrumental music]

41:40.660 --> 41:42.753
I warned you. I-I warned you.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.894
I-I warned you. I-I warned you.

41:50.340 --> 41:53.264
When I call, you answer.

41:53.310 --> 41:56.666
I need you faithful and devoted

41:56.710 --> 41:58.200
or else..

42:00.310 --> 42:03.245
[laughing]

42:16.760 --> 42:19.888
[instrumental music]

42:37.520 --> 42:40.648
[music continues]
