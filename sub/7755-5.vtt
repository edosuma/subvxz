13:01.047 --> 13:05.750
>> Gumball: No, no!
[ Grunts ]
>> Darwin: [ Gasps ]

13:05.752 --> 13:10.088
Dude, you were an ugly baby!
[ Both laugh ]
>> Gumball: I don't know<i> you're</i>

13:10.090 --> 13:15.226
laughing at.
>> Darwin: Aah! Give me that!
No! Give me it!

13:19.832 --> 13:27.939
>> Anais: Pass me that poker.
[ Footsteps pounding ]
>> Mom: Sounds to me like you

13:27.941 --> 13:35.246
really don't need that sandwich.
[ Footsteps pounding ]
>> Anais: Okay, guys,<i> this</i> is

13:35.248 --> 13:41.953
how you solve a case.
[ All coughing ]
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]

13:41.955 --> 13:46.291
Our chimney has been kidnapped!
Detective watterson, shall i
cordon off the area for the

13:46.293 --> 13:51.262
forensic team?
>> Anais: [ Grunts ]
Agh! [ Sighs ]

13:51.264 --> 13:55.667
>> Gumball: Anais? Anais?
Anais, look what we found under
the floorboard!

13:55.669 --> 13:58.970
>> Anais: [ Distorted ] I'm
still the one who found it!
Oh, they're bank statements.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.639
>> Gumball: No, they're bank
statements.
>> Anais: [ Sighs ]

14:01.641 --> 14:06.978
>> Gumball: Look, back here, we
used to have loads of money, and
then it all went in one big

14:06.980 --> 14:10.782
payment to stellar corporation.
>> Darwin: What did mom spend
all that money on?

14:10.784 --> 14:14.552
>> Anais: Well, whatever it was,
I'll bet this key has something
to do with it.

14:14.554 --> 14:21.492
>> Gumball: Wait, I've seen that
key before a long, long time
ago.

14:21.494 --> 14:24.028
>> Darwin: Ready?
>> Gumball: Okay.
>> Darwin: 1, 2, 3, sleep!

14:24.030 --> 14:27.599
>> Gumball: [ Snores ]
>> Darwin: Now I'm gonna take
you back -- all the way back to

14:27.601 --> 14:31.135
the last time you saw that key.
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
I can see it.

14:31.137 --> 14:35.073
>> Anais: [ Gasps ]
>> Gumball: I'm in the attic.
There are bank statements all

14:35.075 --> 14:39.210
over the floor.
>> Anais: That was just now!
>> Darwin: Go further back.

14:39.212 --> 14:44.983
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
Now I'm a baby. I'm with mom.
She -- she's locking a suitcase.

14:44.985 --> 14:48.586
>> Mom: You must never tell
anyone you saw this.
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]

14:48.588 --> 14:51.856
It's the key!
>> Anais: So whatever she bought
is in that case.

14:51.858 --> 14:55.260
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
I'm going further back to
previous lives.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.729
[ Grunting ]
I'm a schoolteacher!
It's boring.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.265
I'm a pharmacist!
Totally boring.
I'm a banker!

15:00.267 --> 15:03.301
That's really boring.
Optician! Boring.
Librarian! Boring.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.004
Prospector! Boring.
Farmer!
Bor-- wait, wait, wait.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.773
Prospector?
>> Yee-haw!
>> Gumball: Hey, that's pretty

15:08.775 --> 15:11.376
good, and I've just found the
gold.
Wait a minute.

15:11.378 --> 15:14.712
I'm not the prospector.
I'm the mule.
[ Snorts ]

15:14.714 --> 15:17.382
>> Darwin: Gumball, stop!
Wake up!
>> Gumball: And now I'm a

15:17.384 --> 15:19.484
hypnotist.
[ Deep voice ] Look into my
eyes.

15:19.486 --> 15:24.022
>> Darwin: Oh...
[ Reel whirs ]
>> Anais: [ Gasps ]

15:24.024 --> 15:26.991
Hey, hey, stop!
Gumball, help!
>> Gumball: [ Normal voice ] Now

15:26.993 --> 15:29.527
you're allergic to cheese.
Cheese!
>> Darwin: Achoo!

15:29.529 --> 15:34.198
Now your body is heavier than
stone.
>> Anais: [ Grunts ]

15:34.200 --> 15:36.901
Hey, come back here!
[ Footsteps pounding ]
[ Thud ]

15:36.903 --> 15:42.774
>> Gumball: Now you can speak
fluent French!
>> Darwin: [ Speaking French ]

15:42.776 --> 15:45.443
>> Both: Hey!
>> Anais: Someone just tried to
steal the key!

15:45.445 --> 15:49.080
We need to get to that suitcase
as quickly as possible!
>> Gumball: Can't we just go to

15:49.082 --> 15:52.283
bed?
Fine.
>> Dad: [ Snoring ]

15:52.285 --> 15:55.853
[ Door creaks ]
>> Mom: [ Yawns ]
What's going on?

15:55.855 --> 16:02.360
>> Gumball: I had a nightmare.
>> Mom: Gumball, honey, you're
too old to sleep in our bed.

16:02.362 --> 16:10.368
[ Clicking ]
All right, just get in.
>> Dad: [ Snoring ]

16:10.370 --> 16:19.677
[ Bed creaks ]
>> Gumball: [ Grunting ]
[ Sighs ]

16:19.679 --> 16:25.950
[ Gasps ]
>> Dad: [ Snoring continues ]
>> Gumball: [ Gasps ]

16:25.952 --> 16:28.953
Oh, that was like being born!

16:34.493 --> 16:38.296
>> Anais: And that's all there
was inside -- an address and a
bunch of doodles?

16:38.298 --> 16:41.399
>> Gumball: Yeah, and, you know,
the shovel.
>> Darwin: Wow.

16:41.401 --> 16:45.136
Who would've thought mom spent
all that money on a rusty, old
shovel.

16:45.138 --> 16:49.440
Well, case closed. Bedtime!
>> Anais: Darwin, don't you see?
This is another clue!

16:49.442 --> 16:53.378
>> Darwin: I'm so tired of all
these clues!
>> Anais: Whatever she bought,

16:53.380 --> 16:56.781
she hid somewhere at this
address.
It must be extremely precious.

16:56.783 --> 17:00.518
>> Darwin: [ Sighs ]
>> Anais: Something<i> big</i> like
missile launch codes, alien

17:00.520 --> 17:04.889
artifacts, a philosopher's
stone, or something even bigger!
>> Gumball: Oh, come on, anais.

17:04.891 --> 17:08.826
If it was that big, mom would've
stopped us by now.
The woman's virtually a ninja.

17:08.828 --> 17:12.196
>> Anais: But that's just it.
It isn't her that's trying to
stop us.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.900
Those footsteps on the roof were
way too heavy.
This goes much deeper than we

17:15.902 --> 17:19.370
thought, and the answer lies at
this address.
So, what do you say?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.440
You coming with me or not?
>> Gumball: Not.
[ Click ]

17:22.442 --> 17:26.310
>> Anais: [ Grunts ]
Where's your sense of adventure?
[ Hissing ]

17:26.312 --> 17:30.348
Stop! Can you hear that?
[ Hissing continues ]
It's gonna blow!

17:30.350 --> 17:36.020
>> Gumball: It's just our tires.
>> Anais: See? They're on to us.
We proceed by foot.

17:36.022 --> 17:44.862
>> Gumball: [ Sighs ]
Is that it?
An empty mailbox?

17:44.864 --> 17:50.401
All of this was a wild goose
chase sending us to the middle
of nowhere at 3:00 A.M. in the

17:50.403 --> 17:53.871
pouring rain!
And what's the stupid shovel
for?!

17:53.873 --> 17:56.374
>> Darwin: I'll show you what
it's for.
[ Grunts ]

17:56.376 --> 17:59.477
That's for wasting our time!
And this for keeping me up all
night!

17:59.479 --> 18:03.381
And this is for the rain!
And this is for not breaking
however many times i hit you!

18:03.383 --> 18:07.385
>> Gumball: And<i> this</i> is for
giving us pointless clues, like
this stupid bunch of doodles!

18:07.387 --> 18:11.155
[ Grunts ]
>> Anais: No, wait!
That's not a doodle.

18:11.157 --> 18:15.393
It's a map!
Look, here's the mailbox.
That's the creepy windmill.

18:15.395 --> 18:18.796
This must be the forest.
>> Gumball: Okay, cool.
We need to go now.

18:18.798 --> 18:21.332
>> Anais: Hold on.
I need to figure out where we're
going.

18:21.334 --> 18:26.604
>> Gumball: No, we need to go
right now.
[ All shout ]

18:26.606 --> 18:30.475
They found us!
We need to get to the treasure
before they get to us!

18:30.477 --> 18:33.911
>> Gumball: I think it's my turn
to go in front, okay?!
Unh!

18:33.913 --> 18:37.281
Found the forest.
>> Anais: Great.
We're looking for an old,

18:37.283 --> 18:43.387
twisted tree in a clearing.
>> Darwin: Aah!
They're still coming!

18:43.389 --> 18:47.458
>> Gumball: [ Grunts ]
Are you sure about this?
It looks kind of dangerous.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.829
>> Anais: It's fine.
Just don't look down.
[ Both shout ]

18:51.831 --> 18:54.432
>> Gumball: Why'd you make us do
that?!
>> Anais: I didn't!

18:54.434 --> 18:57.468
I said,<i> "don't</i> look down."
[ Both shout ]
>> Gumball: You did it again!

18:57.470 --> 19:01.105
>> Anais: Oh, come on, this
thing's been here forever.
It's totally safe.

19:01.107 --> 19:06.177
[ Creaking ]
[ Both shouting ]
Jump!

19:06.179 --> 19:10.748
>> Gumball: Aah!
>> Darwin: Aah!
>> Anais: Take my hand!

19:10.750 --> 19:17.121
>> Gumball: [ Muffled ] I can't
see!
>> Anais: [ Grunting ]

19:17.123 --> 19:20.591
>> Gumball: This treasure better
be worth it.
>> Anais: [ Breathing heavily ]

19:20.593 --> 19:23.594
Guys, look, there it is!

19:28.066 --> 19:33.404
[ Clang ]
That must be it!
>> Stop digging!

19:33.406 --> 19:37.875
>> Gumball: Dad?!
>> Dad: [ Deep voice ] No.
[ Normal voice ] Yeah, it's me.

19:37.877 --> 19:41.646
>> Darwin: Look, I've got it!
>> Dad: No, please, don't open
the box!

19:41.648 --> 19:45.483
I'll give you anything you want!
>> Anais: We want whatever's in
the box.

19:45.485 --> 19:52.089
>> Dad: Noooooo!
>> Darwin: Oh, man, it's another
piece of paper!

19:52.091 --> 19:56.060
>> Dad: It's not just a piece of
paper.
It's the reason we'll never be

19:56.062 --> 20:01.132
able to afford what we want.
>> Gumball: Will someone<i> please</i>
tell me what's going on here?!

20:01.134 --> 20:05.703
>> Dad: [ Sighs ]
It was 12 years ago.
Gumball was just born.

20:05.705 --> 20:12.109
Your mother stayed at the
hospital while the doctors tried
to work out why he was so ugly.

20:12.111 --> 20:16.047
I was left at home alone.
It was the beginning of the
Internet.

20:16.049 --> 20:20.484
"Click now for an
out-of-this-world property
investment for the future of

20:20.486 --> 20:23.087
your kids"?!
Yes!
I clicked too quick.

20:23.089 --> 20:27.658
I should've waited for the page
to finish loading.
Property investment for the

20:27.660 --> 20:34.799
future of your kids' great-
great-great-great-great-great-
great-grandchildren's children?!

20:34.801 --> 20:38.903
I tried to get the money back,
but the company had already gone
bust.

20:38.905 --> 20:43.074
So in my shame, i buried the
evidence.
>> Anais: So it was<i> you</i> hid the

20:43.076 --> 20:46.711
bank statements and tried to
steal the key back.
>> Dad: Yes!

20:46.713 --> 20:50.781
>> Gumball: Yeah, well, that was
a very interesting story, dad.
Well done.

20:50.783 --> 20:55.519
But what did you buy?!
>> Anais: I'll tell you exactly
what it was.

20:55.521 --> 21:00.591
He bought a s--
>> mom: A star.
>> Anais: [ Crying ] No!

21:00.593 --> 21:06.797
You stole my thunder!
>> Dad: You knew? But how?
>> Mom: You talk in your sleep.

21:06.799 --> 21:10.868
>> Dad: And you don't hate me?
>> Mom: I knew you tried to do
well.

21:10.870 --> 21:15.339
It wasn't your fault, honey.
It was the Internet.
>> Gumball: You know what?

21:15.341 --> 21:19.410
It's kind of cool that we have
our own star.
>> Mom: Which one is it?

21:19.412 --> 21:23.748
>> Dad: There.
>> Anais: You know, that star
might not even be there anymore,

21:23.750 --> 21:27.752
but its light travels through
time and space for millions of
years.

21:27.754 --> 21:32.523
It's immaterial, and yet it
still exists.
>> Darwin: Kind of like love.

21:32.525 --> 21:36.294
>> Dad: So, in a way, the star
is a symbol of our family's
love.

21:36.296 --> 21:42.066
>> Gumball: And it'll always be
there -- forever.
[ Poink! ]

21:42.068 --> 21:43.067
>> All: Uh...
