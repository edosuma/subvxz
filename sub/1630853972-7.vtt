I probably should've asked.
- Eh, I think you're fine.

17:49.481 --> 17:51.418
- Heads up. Sea pigs.

17:51.451 --> 17:54.291
- Shut up.
The FBI has Jet Skis?

17:54.324 --> 17:57.330
- Whoo-hoo!
I love civil forfeiture.

17:57.363 --> 17:58.533
- We got these from criminals?

17:58.566 --> 18:00.403
- Fun fact.
They don't even have to be

18:00.436 --> 18:01.673
guilty for us
to take their stuff.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.545
- That cannot be true.
- It is, though.

18:04.578 --> 18:08.285
- Whoo! Jet Ski!
- Whoo!

18:08.553 --> 18:12.293
- [groans]
- Where did you
get that?

18:12.327 --> 18:13.530
[knock on door]

18:13.563 --> 18:15.333
- Pam, what are you doing here?

18:15.366 --> 18:16.536
- Shh, I need a favor.

18:16.569 --> 18:18.607
- Anything, my darling.
- First--

18:18.640 --> 18:22.280
[both moaning]
[fireworks whistle and crackle]

18:22.615 --> 18:26.154
- You probably shouldn't
set off fire
works indoors.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.457
Yeah?

18:27.490 --> 18:30.262
- Agree to disagree.

18:32.501 --> 18:35.607
Alessia made us a care package.
Ka-boom.

18:35.641 --> 18:37.310
- Okay, you can never
break up with her.

18:37.343 --> 18:39.347
- Oh, my God, I love her.

18:39.381 --> 18:40.517
- Those were warning shots.

18:40.550 --> 18:42.721
Stop the boat
or we will open fire.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.328
- AJ, honey,
get below and stay down. AJ?

18:46.361 --> 18:48.299
- [mocking]
Oh, AJ, get below

18:48.332 --> 18:49.267
and stay down.

18:49.301 --> 18:51.438
- We will discuss your tone
later, missy.

18:51.471 --> 18:52.541
- Well, hello.

18:52.574 --> 18:55.580
I'm gonna name you the solution
to all my problems.

18:55.614 --> 18:57.718
- Or maybe we don't blow up

18:57.751 --> 18:59.487
the boat full
of government employees.

18:59.522 --> 19:00.524
- They started it.

19:00.557 --> 19:03.228
- Party boat.
Let's do this.

19:03.630 --> 19:06.636
- Whoo-hoo
!
Waterskiing.

19:06.669 --> 19:10.209

Little too slow for me.

19:10.242 --> 19:11.111
Whoa!

19:11.144 --> 19:12.648
- Come on.
Try not to actually hit him.

19:12.681 --> 19:16.388

a precision operation.

19:28.513 --> 19:30.550

19:30.584 --> 19:32.487
but you're gonna have
to unkink your panties

19:32.521 --> 19:34.424
for about 30 goddamn seconds.

19:34.457 --> 19:36.228
- Do I have to?

19:39.668 --> 19:41.539
- Damn it, I'm out.
- Me too.

19:41.572 --> 19:42.708
- I need you to reach
into my pocket.

19:42.741 --> 19:44.678
- Ah, Jesus.
You have an erection?

19:44.712 --> 19:47.551
- It's a shot glass,
but also, yes.

19:47.584 --> 19:50.222
Use it. The shot glass, I mean.

19:51.425 --> 19:52.528

[explosion]

20:05.554 --> 20:06.455
- Why did you have that?

20:06.488 --> 20:09.528
- Friends in low places,
like whorehouses.

20:09.562 --> 20:10.664
- I know what you meant.

20:10.697 --> 20:12.801
- Consider my panties unkinked.

20:12.835 --> 20:14.672
- Is that in reference
to something?

20:14.705 --> 20:17.978
- Oh, that wasn't you guys.
Never mind.

20:21.719 --> 20:23.556
[gun cocks]
- Hi. Sorry about the gun.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.560
I'll need the golf cart.
- Aw, man.

20:25.594 --> 20:27.397
- Don't be like that.

20:28.566 --> 20:30.537
- Uh, anyone know
where we're going?

20:30.570 --> 20:31.506
- Or who's gonna fly the plane?

20:31.539 --> 20:33.610
- Uh, this is really
as far as my plan went.

20:33.643 --> 20:36.415
[engine roars]

20:36.448 --> 20:37.818
- Well, I guess we lost them.

20:37.851 --> 20:41.592
- No, you've inspired me today,
and I am not giving up.

20:41.626 --> 20:43.429
Well, hello, beautiful.

I see you finally made it.

it has a safety.

20:57.758 --> 21:01.966
[explosion]

21:03.603 --> 21:04.772
You know what?
That's it. I quit.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.609
I'm gonna go back
to clown college.

21:06.642 --> 21:07.644
- I'll be right there
behind you.

21:09.682 --> 21:11.586
What the fuck, Archer?

- Slater, it's you.
I'm so sorry.

21:13.790 --> 21:17.764
I should've shot you twice.
- Wow. You look--

- Really bad.

21:19.635 --> 21:20.637
- Jesus,
the CIA's involved now?

21:20.670 --> 21:22.875
Could we just skip
all the usual agro-bullshit

21:22.908 --> 21:25.747
and get to the point?
- Your old boss, Fabian,

21:25.780 --> 21:28.887
used that blackmail info you
stole from the bank to
destabilize

21:28.920 --> 21:32.528
the country of Manatina,
where he's now fled.

21:32.561 --> 21:33.630
- Hey, in our defense,

21:33.663 --> 21:35.667
we didn't know
it was blackmail info.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.869
- So your defense is
you're stupid.

21:36.903 --> 21:40.510
- I'd also like to say that
in my defense, he's stupid.

21:40.544 --> 21:41.746
- So what are you doing here?

21:41.779 --> 21:42.815
You're not
domestic law enforcement.

21:42.848 --> 21:46.622
- The better question
is what is Ray doing here.

21:46.656 --> 21:47.524
[all gasp]

21:47.558 --> 21:49.829
Lana: Oh, my God,
Ray really did flip.

21:49.862 --> 21:52.835
This is hopeless.
- Now, hang on one minute.

21:52.868 --> 21:55.707
Just because Ray sucks
doesn't mean we do too.

21:55.740 --> 21:56.843
I've done more living
in the past day

21:56.876 --> 22:00.550
than I have in years,
and I don't intend to stop now,

[cheers and applause]

22:08.566 --> 22:09.602
And you know what?

22:09.635 --> 22:11.772
While we're at it,
I have an announcement to make.

22:11.806 --> 22:14.477
I'm ready
to start dating again.

[laughter]

22:17.718 --> 22:20.524
- You haven't dated since Lana?

22:20.557 --> 22:21.926
- What? You wait one year

22:21.959 --> 22:23.830
for every month
you dated someone.

22:23.863 --> 22:26.702
- No, it's the opposite
of that.

22:31.746 --> 22:33.683
- Please, never learn that.

22:33.716 --> 22:35.720
God, thank you so much, Cyril.

22:35.754 --> 22:38.458
It just feels so good...
- To laugh?

22:38.493 --> 22:39.662
