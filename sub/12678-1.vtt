00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Someone fell sick and is being taken to hospital from the plant.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
Male, around twenty.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
Temperature above 40. Unconscious.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
No trauma or bleeding.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
He's in great pain.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Patient needs immediate medical care.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Come in, please!

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
Kansen
(Infection)

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
The patient in Ward 5 fell down.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
He seems can hardly breathe.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Shut up.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
I can see.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
Why he fell? Who's in charge?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
He stood up by himself.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You shouldn't.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
It's not the time you could walk by yourself yet.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
I called for help.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Many times. Nobody cared me.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
No, no. It'll surely be remitted next week.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
The money will be in.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
Look, I'm not so well-to-do myself.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
Don't be absurd! I alway take you...

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
...take you as the most important person in my life.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
More than you...

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Dr. Uozumi.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Here you are.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
The patient with high fever is still waiting.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Look.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Still waiting? I've been waiting and waiting.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
As I told you.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Stay in the line.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Still waiting?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
I feel dizzy.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Please answer me!

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
20 years old male. Weak heartbeat.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Arising temperature. Danger!

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Please answer me!

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Thank you.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
What the hell? The damn hospital.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
The salary is 3 days late.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I just called them.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
I beg you. Please.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
The patient is waiting.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Is it Nanae? What's the matter with him?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
You're in charge of Ward 5.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Outpatient and inpatient, which one to choose?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
You have to take care of both.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
I see. Take him in right now.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
So, our salary is going in, too, right?

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Sorry.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Please answer me!

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
20 years old male.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Arising temperatue. Help!

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Hospital, come in please!

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
The air conditioning doesn't work.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Generator problem. Unstable voltage.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Dr. Akiba.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Come here.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
We're short of syringes, needles and bandages.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
And the drugs...

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
Will them hold on for a while?

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
There were 9 nurses quit in 2 weeks.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
The hospital is doomed and everybody finds their ways of living.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
Just hold on for a while.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
WIll that be of any use?

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
No salary for the nurses.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Inpatients were out of care.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
They gathered together and it'll likely induce infections within the hopital at any time.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
It's time to speak the truth.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Doctor, emergency!

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
If you want to keep the hospital,

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
please discharge some patients.

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
Which? Which patients to discharge? If...

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
I know.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I don't want it like this, either.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Please.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Where's the pain?

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
The chest.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Can't stand it?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Can't be cured?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Advanced stage. Surgery won't do.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
DOn't lose your heart.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Since it can't be cured,

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
could you give me more sleeping pills?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
No way. If I give you more,

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
it will be overdosed.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Dosen't matter. Just give me.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Whatever it is, please give me

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
as long as it would make me feel better.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
No.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Just take it.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Together with me.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
When did the dizziness start?

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
I didn't take it series at first.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
So I can't remember when.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
When I found it.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
What?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
Tell me!

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
When I found it, I fell down.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Fell down?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Bumped your head?

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
Why nobody found it? How long have you been here?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
So many patients...

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
All right. Send for Dr. Akiba now.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Sorry.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
I'm in the duty room. Available at any time.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
Use this when you need me.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Hey, stop it.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
It's not done yet.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
Sending a newbie like you, it's my fault.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Let me do it.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
Shut up.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
You know what you are doing?

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
The patients are not someting for your practice.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
You were going to far for the patients.

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
If you want practice, use your own body.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Come here.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
Come on.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Everybody come here.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Come on.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
Please come in! The patient's condition has worsened.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
Please come in now.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
How's it? Is it brain trauma?

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
He walked here by himself from the national highway.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
Cerebral bleeding. Extradural edema.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
And arachnoid cavity bleeding.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Leave it to you.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
I'll go to check the outpatients.

10:07.000 --> 10:11.000
Come here, everyone.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
Grandpa made the dinner. Come on.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Don't hide there, grandma.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Let's eat.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Please.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
Let me see your hand.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Send her to Dr. Nakayu in the neurology division.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
What are you doing?

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
Suturing.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
I can do it, too.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Simple suture.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
Simple? Suture is the operation of an outstanding surgeon.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
I'm a surgeon, too.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
I won't allow you to suture.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
Bad stitches like this will put the surgeon division to an end.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Let me try.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
I can do it.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
You want it so bad?

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
You,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
only know suturing, suturing, suturing.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
You can't treat people like this.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Call me 3 hours later.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
I'm in Ward 5.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I can do it.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Sutrue for me, it's...

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
"Temporarily closed"

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Hospital can take in patient, please come in!

12:22.000 --> 12:26.000
Skin ulcers appear. Emergency!

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
20 years old male.

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
Sustained high fever. Weak heartbeat. In danger!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Please come in now!

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
20 years old male. The ulcers spread all over...

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
Yes. This is Seiichi.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
"Please take in the emergency patient now."

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
We can't take any patient in right now.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
Do you understand? I'm hanging.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
"If you don't do anything, he will..."

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
We can't do anything even if you send him here.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Is there glasses there?

13:09.000 --> 13:12.000
So.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
What's it?

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
I know.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Look. Everyone's here.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Sorry. I have to make dinner at once.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.000
That's not big news.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
It'll be like this when the brain atrophies.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Is the dinner ready?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Please make yourself at home.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
She saw her parents and brothers who died long ago.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
Why they showed in the mirror every time?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.999
That's an enigma.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
We can know what she's thinking about with a mirror.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
Red. Why it looks always red?

14:20.000 --> 14:23.000
Did you think about it?

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
It looks like this in the sun light.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
And it looks the same in the bulb light.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Isn't it weird?

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
That means it all about the brain.

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
What the eyes see...

14:43.000 --> 14:46.000
are mostly generated by the brain.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
When there're some changes in brain circuits,

14:49.000 --> 14:53.000
people in the memory will appear.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
It dosen't matter if she just looks into the mirror.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
But don't let her hold the mirror.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
It would stimulate her nerves.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.900
I understand.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.900
She's also got cigarettes.

15:16.900 --> 15:20.000
They might come from other patients.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
I'll come at 7 tomorrow.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Are you on the night shift today?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.900
Take care.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Today is...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.200
I can do it, too.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.900
Just suture.

16:14.800 --> 16:14.999
I'm a surgeon, too.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.300
Let me show you.

16:24.000 --> 16:28.000
No nurses and doctors. Everything's running out.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.000
The reconstruction of the hospital is just halfway done.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
What's the adminstration going to do?

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
Uozumi, don't let it out.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.100
Since yesterday,

16:44.100 --> 16:46.200
we lost the contact with the director of the hospital.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.400
No news for his family, either.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.400
Patients can't be discharged.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
Some patients cannot be transfered.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
We have to take them through.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.200
I got it.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Let's contact the hospital.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
But...

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
I will quit after tomorrow.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.400
Why?

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
Why we're not allowed to use the apparatus?

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
I'm not so good at injecting, so I want...

18:05.000 --> 18:07.500
We're short of syringes.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Don't be absurd again.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.000
Mono, patient in Ward 3, emergency!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Ward 3.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
What are you doing? Don't come in.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
This patient has been left uncared for more than 1 hour.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
No nurses whatsoever.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
It will be dangerous if we don't do something now.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
That's an even more tough call.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
It's the limit already.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.000
We can't do it!

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
Can you just look him till he die?

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
If he dies and you do nothing.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.200
Where is he?

19:01.000 --> 19:01.900
Where is the patient?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.100
Here.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
How would this happen?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.800
Felt from the bed.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Call Dr. Akiba and Dr. Uozumi.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.800
OK.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.100
Go back to your own ward.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
If we send the patient away from here...

19:34.000 --> 19:36.600
and he dies on the way,

19:37.000 --> 19:39.900
I will report the condition of your hospital.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I got it.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
I understand.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
Send him to the emergency room. Just did what we can do. Don't expect more.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.700
Nothing can do.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.100
Dr. Akiba.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.700
Patient in Ward 3 shocked.

20:04.000 --> 20:04.600
Ward 3.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.200
We can't do it whatsoever. Send him somewhere else!

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Stop it!

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
What is it?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Fell down, from the bed.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Fell down? By yourself?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.300
I don't know.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.400
It's an unconscious coma.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.700
Check BP and HB.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.900
What is it?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
Hey, what is it?

20:39.000 --> 20:40.000
BP 60.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Put CPR on right now.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
What is it?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Fell down from the bed?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
From the bed? It's impossible.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
Oh, my god. No heartbeat now.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Preparing the infusion.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.200
All righ.

20:57.000 --> 21:01.000
No. Get atropine and calcium chloride.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
Take her away!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.500
Here you are. Atropine.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
Let's get out of here.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.100
Set to 200.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.600
Doctor, let me do it.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.200
It's set to 200 now.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.600
Clear. OK.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.600
No. Rise to 250!

21:39.000 --> 21:40.100
OK.

21:51.000 --> 21:51.600
No response.

21:55.000 --> 21:58.100
Hurry. Get potassium...

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Make her stop!

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
It's set to 250 now.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Rise to 300!

22:03.000 --> 22:05.300
Use potassium chloride.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.100
OK.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.200
That won't work.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
If it dosen't, we just open the chest.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
In there?

22:19.000 --> 22:20.500
It's set to 300 now.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.000
Come on.

22:24.100 --> 22:25.800
Wait.

22:31.000 --> 22:31.700
Please.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Got it!

22:49.000 --> 22:51.600
What did you put in?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Why this color?

22:55.000 --> 22:56.600
What did you just put in?

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
The Doctor told us to...

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
use potassium chloride

23:01.100 --> 23:02.000
potassium chloride?

23:02.500 --> 23:05.800
It should be calcium chloride!

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
But..

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
Doc, you said...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
Incise it! Get ready for surgery!

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
Not here

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Uozumi, got any different solution?

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
No, it should be calcium chloride

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Hurry!

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
It's too late

23:21.000 --> 23:22.300
Cut the bullshit!

23:24.000 --> 23:24.600
Stop

23:25.000 --> 23:27.500
Stop, it's incurable!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.100
It's incurable

23:41.000 --> 23:42.100
I

23:43.000 --> 23:44.600
But

23:45.000 --> 23:47.700
I think it was potassium chloride

23:50.000 --> 23:51.100
It's okay

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
Anywat, it's happened

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
Is that my fault? It was me who...

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
Shut up, everything is too late

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
I killed him

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
Dr. Akiba did say potassium chloride

24:07.000 --> 24:08.600
Shut up

24:10.000 --> 24:13.200
It's okay, don't worry about it

24:13.200 --> 24:15.000
I heard it clearly

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
What Dr. Akiba said is not potassium chloride
it's...

24:19.000 --> 24:20.200
Shut up

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
You want to shirk resposibility?

24:25.000 --> 24:28.900
Anyway, I have to write the report

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
How?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
What report?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Wait

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
Nobody wants the patient to die

24:40.000 --> 24:43.000
It's a medical malpractice!

24:43.000 --> 24:44.700
That's true

24:46.000 --> 24:48.400
I can not recall anything

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
How can I direct like that?
But

24:55.000 --> 24:56.600
Obviously

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
I must take the resposibility

25:06.000 --> 25:10.000
Wait. The lack of heartbeat
means he's dead in the first place

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Yes, but

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
The direct cause is wrong medicine!

25:15.000 --> 25:19.000
Had we found it a little late
he would die as well

25:19.900 --> 25:21.000
Naturally, he is likely to die

25:21.000 --> 25:23.300
Hold on, Dr. Uozumi

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
You are going to tamper with the
medical certificate

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
What the heck do you want?

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
We have been working to save
this patient for 3 months

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
Nobody expects such accident

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Only once

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
Only once?

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
It's just some minor error like mixing
sterlization solution into intravenous dirp solution

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Tiny mistake on battlefield of saving lives

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
You're his physician-in-charge

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
The patient's life is in your hand

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
So let me finish what I'm saying

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
2/3 of his skin was burnt severely

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
Even if we revive him, the cells
can't restore quickly

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
And it's hard to say if we can revive him!

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Ok, doc

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
It's my fault

26:11.000 --> 26:14.000
I'll take the responsibility!

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
I

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
If I had considered carefully

26:20.000 --> 26:22.100
I should know

26:25.000 --> 26:29.000
Let's handle the aftermath

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
If Dr. Akiba not in this hospital

26:36.000 --> 26:40.000
It should like this

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Considering the situation in
this hospital now

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
If medical malpractice is reported

26:45.000 --> 26:48.000
What will the patients think?

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
But we can not give false report

26:51.000 --> 26:54.900
All of us will be fired

26:54.900 --> 26:58.900
What if the outsiders know it?

27:01.000 --> 27:05.000
If some journalists get to know this case

27:06.000 --> 27:10.000
we'll be fucked

27:16.000 --> 27:18.100
Mono

27:19.000 --> 27:23.000
Since this patient came here

27:23.000 --> 27:27.000
he didn't get any visitor

27:28.000 --> 27:31.500
family, friends

27:34.000 --> 27:35.500
Nobody

28:13.000 --> 28:14.400
Nobody knows

28:17.000 --> 28:19.100
this patient?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
If we take out the organs
and get rid of those cells

28:24.000 --> 28:28.000
there will be no potassium chloride left

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
Only the intravenous dripped Calcium Chloride
remains

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
In other words, it can't be perceived

28:34.000 --> 28:38.000
If the blood be tested

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
Let's prepare a unified statement
just say it's natural death, nobody will doubt

28:44.000 --> 28:48.000
This corpse won't be received by his family

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
he will be sent to mortuary

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
and is likely to be dissected

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
It takes 3 days for cells to be
completely decomposed

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
It's too long
We have to report the death in 2 days

29:20.000 --> 29:22.100
heat it up

29:25.000 --> 29:28.000
Heat accelerates the decomposing

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
And the patient's skin was burnt severely

29:33.000 --> 29:37.000
It's even faster

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
and normal

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
here?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Both Room 1 and Room 5 are empty

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
Room 5 is administered by Dr. Kishida

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
Kishida, in Room 5?

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
This is Room 3

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
Room 5 and Room 4 are on the opposite
side of the corridor

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
OK, to Room 1

30:03.000 --> 30:06.300
We still have time

30:07.000 --> 30:08.900
Destroy the cardiogram records

30:13.000 --> 30:14.400
It's okay

30:16.000 --> 30:18.400
Don't worry about this patient

31:16.000 --> 31:18.500
The smell will be the kiss of death

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
It's okay

31:24.000 --> 31:25.100
I'll stay behind

31:37.000 --> 31:39.500
Doc

31:41.000 --> 31:42.900
I'm sorry

31:44.000 --> 31:47.500
I just misconceived

31:49.000 --> 31:50.400
Never mind

31:55.000 --> 31:56.300
I

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
teacher's...

32:00.000 --> 32:01.700
will forever...

32:05.000 --> 32:05.900
It's okay

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
When the muscles degrade

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
twitching is common

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
How long have you been graduated?

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
3 months

32:26.000 --> 32:29.000
So foolish

32:29.000 --> 32:31.300
How old are you?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.400
23 years

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
What?

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Have you ever been faculty member
at your own university?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
No

32:39.000 --> 32:40.100
I'll do my best

32:42.000 --> 32:43.900
That's useless

32:45.000 --> 32:49.000
if you have no talent of nurse

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
But you are allowed to be a nurse here

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
Do you understand?

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
You can barely be a nurse

33:02.000 --> 33:04.400
Only in this hospital

33:14.000 --> 33:16.800
I'm sure I can

34:30.000 --> 34:31.500
What's that?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.800
Patient at the door of emergency room

34:38.000 --> 34:40.100
door of emergency room?

34:41.000 --> 34:43.100
Oh no...

34:46.000 --> 34:46.800
Where?

34:49.000 --> 34:52.100
Just here a moment ago

35:01.000 --> 35:02.900
Dr. Akiba

35:07.000 --> 35:08.300
Dr. Akiba

35:09.000 --> 35:10.000
I'm here

35:11.000 --> 35:11.700
Sir...

35:55.000 --> 35:56.500
Dr. Anseki

35:58.000 --> 35:59.400
Dr. Akiba

36:01.000 --> 36:03.600
What about this patient?

36:03.600 --> 36:06.000
Forsaken there

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
Sorry, there was an emergency treatment
when I took over

36:10.800 --> 36:11.600
Sir

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Didn't you go home?

36:15.700 --> 36:17.600
I fell asleep

36:18.000 --> 36:20.700
in the bed in sickroom

36:20.700 --> 36:22.700
in sickroom?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Which one?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
Which sickroom did you sleep in?

36:28.000 --> 36:28.900
What?

36:32.000 --> 36:35.000
If only you were woken up

36:35.000 --> 36:36.700
Room 4

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
Room 4?

36:39.000 --> 36:43.000
Yes, the same room where the brain
injury patient stays

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
He was asleep when being observed

36:46.000 --> 36:49.100
And he woke just now

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
What's wrong?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
No

36:54.000 --> 36:54.800
Akiba

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
I'm sure you haven't looked at this patient

37:01.000 --> 37:02.600
You must take a look

37:05.000 --> 37:06.200
OK

37:52.000 --> 37:54.800
I never seen

37:55.000 --> 37:56.200
What's this?

37:57.000 --> 38:01.000
Well, How to say? Even the innards
are rotting

38:01.000 --> 38:03.600
He is looking at me

38:04.000 --> 38:05.800
and smiling

38:08.000 --> 38:09.400
He did the same thing to me

38:17.000 --> 38:21.000
We must report to the bureau of
public health

38:21.000 --> 38:22.500
Wait, Akiba

38:23.000 --> 38:24.400
Think about it

38:25.000 --> 38:29.000
It's the first time we see this

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
Do some research, and we will be
the foremost discoverers

38:35.000 --> 38:39.000
But, what if it is infective?

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
We'd better report to the bureau of
public health

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Look, Akiba

38:44.000 --> 38:46.900
If we call them...

38:51.000 --> 38:54.900
Shiozaki, get Dr. Uozumi here

38:57.500 --> 38:59.100
Yes sir

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
Patient in Room 3, fell from the bed

39:08.000 --> 39:12.000
Someone completely paralysed fell
from the bed

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
What do you think?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
It's his fear of you!

39:21.000 --> 39:23.000
He fears you

39:23.000 --> 39:25.000
So he tried to escape

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
No

39:27.000 --> 39:30.000
How many times you injected him?
How much injury he suffered?

39:30.000 --> 39:31.000
No

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
Isn't this what you weared

39:33.000 --> 39:37.000
in front of Room 3?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.200
Yes!£¡

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
It was you

39:45.000 --> 39:46.700
who murdered that patient!

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
What the hell?

40:24.000 --> 40:26.800
He is laughing at me

40:28.000 --> 40:31.000
Tell me what to do

40:31.000 --> 40:32.600
Research him

40:34.600 --> 40:35.000
Research?

40:35.000 --> 40:41.000
Internal organs decomposing, it's never
documented in any medicine book!

40:41.000 --> 40:44.300
I'm sure you don't want to stay in
this hospital forever

40:45.000 --> 40:46.600
Nor do I

40:47.000 --> 40:51.000
If we find the pathogen and publish it

40:52.000 --> 40:55.000
we are the discoverers of the new virus

40:55.000 --> 40:57.900
The virus will be named after us

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Every hospital will invite us

41:01.000 --> 41:03.500
we can use research funds at will

41:04.000 --> 41:05.600
Let's do this

41:07.000 --> 41:10.900
This is our secret research!

41:16.000 --> 41:17.300
Uozumi

41:20.000 --> 41:24.000
I won't join you
I don't know about the infectivity

41:25.000 --> 41:25.000
It's too horrible

41:25.000 --> 41:29.000
I won't, either

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
But you have no choice

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
Why

41:33.000 --> 41:36.000
It's not the order of director

41:36.000 --> 41:37.800
He was in Room 4

41:39.000 --> 41:42.400
He was in Room 4 at that moment

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
I don't know if he heard it

41:46.000 --> 41:48.500
He said he was asleep

41:51.000 --> 41:54.400
The one in Room 1, 3 hours remain

41:55.000 --> 41:56.600
Let's work against time

41:59.000 --> 42:03.000
Everything should be ok after we done

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
Have you finished the discussion?

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
Let's prepare for it

42:09.000 --> 42:12.000
First, collect the cell sample to observe

42:12.000 --> 42:13.000
Shiozaki

42:13.000 --> 42:16.000
Connect the cardiogram cable

42:16.000 --> 42:18.700
Pay attention to the patient

43:20.000 --> 43:21.800
Where?

43:25.000 --> 43:26.800
Not here

43:28.000 --> 43:30.400
Where?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.500
Doc

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
Sleep well, keep quiet

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
He's still there

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
What's up?

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
This patient often goes to Room 1

45:17.000 --> 45:19.800
I bring her here to make he quiet

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
I have some important job

45:23.000 --> 45:24.700
You, take a look at Room 1

45:26.000 --> 45:26.600
Got it

45:33.000 --> 45:35.200
Are you still here?

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Still here

46:33.000 --> 46:34.300
Shiozaki

46:36.000 --> 46:37.900
Hey, Shiozaki

46:48.000 --> 46:49.500
Where is he?

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Vanished!

46:55.000 --> 46:56.000
How could that be!

46:56.000 --> 46:59.000
The tissues vaporized!

46:59.000 --> 47:02.400
Maybe gone

47:03.000 --> 47:04.800
The muscle tissues vanished!

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
That body...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
We have to consider every possibility

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Even if we collect all the tissues

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
it can't reach the patient's original volume

47:17.000 --> 47:20.800
Yes, it's too little!

47:29.000 --> 47:30.600
Gone?

47:33.000 --> 47:35.200
We must find him!

47:36.000 --> 47:38.100
Hurry!

50:01.000 --> 50:02.300
What did you see?

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
No, nothing

50:10.000 --> 50:13.400
Bad things come one after another!

50:18.000 --> 50:22.000
Anseki, have we really seen?

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Is that really hide in
somewhere in the hospital?

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Actually, it's incredible...

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
It's incredible

50:39.000 --> 50:40.500
Without muscles

50:43.000 --> 50:44.000
even if I neglect elementary knowledge
of medicine science

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
I can't believe it's gone!

50:46.000 --> 50:47.400
It't not

50:48.000 --> 50:52.000
I mean the thing before that

50:54.000 --> 50:57.100
Have we really seen?

50:59.000 --> 51:02.300
Are you sure?

51:03.000 --> 51:04.300
That

51:06.000 --> 51:07.200
What do you mean?

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
We were in confusion

51:13.000 --> 51:16.500
Maybe we saw something else

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
Did we

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
confuse some part of the scenery
with human face...

51:20.000 --> 51:23.100
We did saw it!

51:24.000 --> 51:25.400
We saw it!

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Where are the muscle tissues?

51:29.000 --> 51:32.000
He is a human being

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
His body resolved, or the muscles degraded...

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
The man melted with a smile
We did saw that

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
Excuse me

51:51.000 --> 51:52.900
I am go to work

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
everyone leaves!I even not start

52:21.000 --> 52:24.700
we should save our resourse...

52:31.000 --> 52:33.500
it's really waste of resourse

52:34.000 --> 52:38.000
it's for the zymosis

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
what you doing

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
shiozaki

52:58.000 --> 53:00.400

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000

53:04.000 --> 53:05.600

56:36.000 --> 56:38.600
it's ok

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
but this kind of virus

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
can infect other people

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
we should do something before it infect others

56:58.000 --> 57:01.000
shiozakiµÄ

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.100
Doctor anseki

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
we have no other choice

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
it's separate by spit

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
can't be sure

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
room 5 have everything ok

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.200
it's maybe more serious

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.000
we don't know how

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000

if you get this!you be dead

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
you are so stupid

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
you can never be a doctor

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000
it's human solvent

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
not some kind of virus

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
it's bullshit

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:58.000
it like some kind of cell

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
few hours after you die

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
the cell can still reproduce

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.700
Doctor anseki

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.800
what theory you depend on

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.800
why you can sure this was some kind of virus

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.300

you decide the dead lin

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.900
1 hour

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.800
after 1 hour,we still can do nothing

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.000
we report

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.900
this hospital will be sealed

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.300
no one can get out

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
we can only wait to die

this virus was send by you£¿

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
you have the blood serum

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.000
use hospital as your experiment place

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:50.000
i didn't do it

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.600
akiba

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000
when you in room 3

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.600
i was nearby

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000
near by

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Mr. Akiba

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
I didn't go to sleep

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.600
I'm awake

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.400
What's the matter?

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.900
How does it related to the infection?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.900
We deserve to be punished

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Right?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:45.000
That's an accident, not something to be ashamed of

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Yes, an accident

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.800
There is nothing we can do

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.800
People die every minute

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
It's what happened afterwards

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.200
afterwards, Mr. Akiba

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
to cover the crime you committed

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
The virus is not transmitted by air

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.500
but by will

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.600
Will?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000
In dreams

Your will get infected

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.100
without even

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.400
knowing about it

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.400
Shit!

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000
It's you who have been performing
the experiment on human body
You are waiting for the chance

01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:43.000
You are waiting for us to make mistakes
so that you can use it against us

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.100
You are insane

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Even if we were wrong

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.400
you don't have the right to blame us!

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Mr. Akiba

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Dr. Nakayu

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Dr. Nakayu, it's dangerous here
Go!

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000
The virus has spreaded out
Go!

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Now!

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.500
Who are you talking to?

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.400
Who?

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Sir

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:20.700
Who are you talking to?

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.300
Dr. Anseki

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.500
Anseki?

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.600
Look carefully

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.000
No one is here

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Sir

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.100
No one...

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000
The virus is spreading out

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
The blood and body fluid flowing out are green

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Wait, hey!

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
I'm infected!

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Nobody get closer!

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.400
Trust me!

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
There is a patient with a rare disease

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.000
He turned green and evaporated

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Everyone is infected
They all become green and dead...

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
It's the central hospital

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.500
Murder, help!

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.400
Be quick

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Be quick

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.300
Akai

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.200
How

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.800
How

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.400
How did this happen?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.400
Dr. Akai

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.700
Why are you still here?

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.600
Are you there?

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.900
Who are you talking to?

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.000
No chance to live...

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.200
The virus infects your will

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
by dreams

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:27.300
Akiba, you are infected

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000
No heartbeat

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Raise to 300

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.800
Got you

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:45.900
Again

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
No pulse

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
Use Calcium Chloride

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.400
Yepp, use Calcium Chloride

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
No, should be Potassium Chloride

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
Yes, Potassium Chloride

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Wrong!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.500
Stop

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.600
Mr. Kishiba

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.500
Sir, it's 7 o'clock

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000
Get up

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.100
Sir

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.900
Sir

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:17.600
Something is wrong

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:28.000
...2 Doctors and 4 nurses were murdered

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.400
Dr. Akiba disappeared and the police is now looking
for the suspects

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:40.000
It's the report from the first-aider
who knows Akiba before the incident

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:44.000
It's completely inhumane
He didn't even take a look at the patient who needed urgent help

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:49.000
This is not what you should do as a doctor

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
What did you do at that time?

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
At last, I didn't sent the patient to that hospital
How lucky!

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.700
You are responsible for that patient, right?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
I don't know

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Here is your signature

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
We didn't fully understand the symptons of the patient
so we cannot treat him

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
What sympton?

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Can you just look?

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.500
I'm sorry

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000
Dr. Nakayu

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.800
How can you still be here?

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Still
