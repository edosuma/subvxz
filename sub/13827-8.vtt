(PANTING) Had... enough... zbornak?

15:48.282 --> 15:51.743
I'm just gettin' started, you optic
nerd. Huh?

16:02.337 --> 16:05.257
Must... stop their... fighting.

16:05.591 --> 16:10.554
Must... give toast at... 30th...
wedding... anniversary...

16:10.637 --> 16:13.348
Oh, no! Dominator's gonna kill him!

♪ Commander Peepers! And Sylvia! ♪

16:26.028 --> 16:28.405
Stop it! There's got to be a better way!

16:28.530 --> 16:30.657
You two have so much in common.

16:30.741 --> 16:34.411
You both want to control the galaxy, you
both want to destroy each other,

16:34.494 --> 16:39.958
You both like skulls. Let's use that as a
foundation and build from there.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.544
I was totally holding back before,

16:42.628 --> 16:46.173
but now you shall know the full
fury of Lord...

16:46.715 --> 16:51.303
Ow! That's super burny!

16:53.889 --> 16:59.770
Stop... being... so... cool!

16:59.853 --> 17:03.482
Okay, new plan, if romance won't come to
the mountain,

17:03.565 --> 17:06.485
then the mountain must become romantic.

17:08.195 --> 17:12.157
(FRENCH ACCENT) Such a lovely couple
deserves ze beautiful flowers.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.746

dinner. Mwah.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.306
Okay, maybe we're being too forward.

17:36.515 --> 17:38.308
How about a low-stakes coffee date?

17:42.479 --> 17:45.482
Ah! The cinnamon! It burns!

17:49.987 --> 17:54.491
How can he stare longingly into your eyes
if he can't see your face?

17:57.744 --> 18:02.958
LORD HATER: Yes! Nothing will keep me from
that ring, for I am Lord Hater...

18:07.212 --> 18:11.258
Wander! Oh, thank Grop you're okay! I
thought something terrible happened.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.385
Something terrible did happen.

18:13.510 --> 18:18.807
This is less of a meet-cute and more of a
meet "Rah-Gah! I'm going to destroy you!"

18:19.099 --> 18:21.476
Your heart's in the right place, buddy,

18:21.560 --> 18:25.689
but if we don't bolt, the rest of you is
gonna be splattered all over the mountain!

18:25.772 --> 18:28.025
But if Hater and Dominator don't
fall in love,

18:28.108 --> 18:32.112
they'll never get married and invest in a
mid-size time-share on Ziziks!

18:33.071 --> 18:35.532
-Eh, what?
-That's what I said.

-Let's get outta here!

18:53.383 --> 18:56.887
No, this has got to work! I have a series
of ice breakers. "What's your

18:56.970 --> 19:01.558
favorite time of day?" "What embarrassing
thing have you never told anybody?" Oh!

19:01.642 --> 19:04.186
"What's your favorite type of chocolate?"

No, but they were supposed to and
now they...

19:44.685 --> 19:48.146
And now she... And it didn't work?

19:49.731 --> 19:54.111
I really thought with love in his life,
Hater would finally learn,

19:54.236 --> 19:57.364
there's no point in being so angry
and evil all the time.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.740
I'm sorry, buddy.
