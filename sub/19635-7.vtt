WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:03.874
My name's Ellie. I'm a
detective with Wessex Police.

00:03.899 --> 00:05.160
You called about an attack.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.367
Who did this to me?

00:06.880 --> 00:08.440
The day of the party...

00:08.480 --> 00:10.476
Trish and me, we were in bed together.

00:10.718 --> 00:14.320
I didn't do it.
You know that, don't you?

00:14.360 --> 00:16.000
Wessex Police. Who are you?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.640
Ed Burnett. This is my shop.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.203
Difficulty for us, Ed...
is that this is very similar

00:20.509 --> 00:23.269
to the twine used... in the
attack on Trish Winterman.

00:23.309 --> 00:25.269
Results of Ed's phone's coming through.

00:25.309 --> 00:28.589
- How many photos are on here?
- 5,219.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.989
That's not love. That's obsession.

00:31.029 --> 00:33.523
There was a serious sexual assault
at the party on Saturday.

00:33.781 --> 00:35.447
What, so you come for the cab driver?

00:35.664 --> 00:37.171
Why are you lying to us, Lucas?

00:37.257 --> 00:41.167
It's daft but...
I picked a fare up off the road.

00:41.546 --> 00:43.367
He thinks he's a good
liar but he's not.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.781
Trish is recently
separated from her husband Ian.

00:46.906 --> 00:49.727
It's not very nice seeing the woman
you used to be married to,

00:49.767 --> 00:53.178
drunk and cavorting
with a lot of strange men.

00:53.203 --> 00:56.148
That stuff you did to the laptop
I gave you, can you delete it?

00:56.250 --> 00:58.039
Where were you on Saturday night?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.585
I was out with my girlfriend.

01:00.061 --> 01:03.021
We had a few drinks at The Anglers,
and then a kebab on the way home.

01:03.061 --> 01:05.061
- What sort of kebab?
- Doner.

01:05.116 --> 01:07.716
- Was the kebab shop busy?
- Don't think so, no.

01:07.741 --> 01:09.335
- Do you believe her?
- Not a word.

01:09.382 --> 01:13.021
My name is Laura Benson. I live
at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere.

01:13.061 --> 01:17.710
Two years ago... I was raped...
and I never told anyone.

01:18.140 --> 01:20.701
It was a mistake. With Danny.
I didn't mean to kill him.

01:20.741 --> 01:22.741
Take me through the night
you killed my son.

01:22.781 --> 01:25.101
- Dad.
- I've done my best for you Chloe.

01:26.501 --> 01:29.381
I'm just sorry if sometimes
that wasn't enough.

Hello?

02:31.284 --> 02:32.456
What you doing, Mum?

02:33.034 --> 02:34.450
Get Lizzie dressed for me.

02:34.667 --> 02:36.143
And put some clothes on yourself.

02:36.534 --> 02:37.534
Why?

02:42.346 --> 02:43.518
Is that Daisy's bag?

02:44.010 --> 02:45.330
I don't want to talk about it.

02:45.370 --> 02:48.878
We work together, so whatever's going
on in your life affects me too.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.810
Especially since there's less than
six hours left on a suspect,

02:51.850 --> 02:53.650
which is why I'm calling
at this ungodly hour.

02:53.690 --> 02:56.010
- So tell me what's happening?
- She's booked on a train.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.299
She wants to go.

02:58.643 --> 03:00.776
I've asked her not to.
I've begged her not to.

03:02.284 --> 03:03.250
She said she'd sleep on it.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.190
She's gonna call me at work
and let me know.

03:05.330 --> 03:07.330
You know what I'd do?
I'd tear her ticket up,

03:07.370 --> 03:09.090
put it in my pocket, go to work, done!

03:09.206 --> 03:11.307
- I can't do that!
- Well, I can.

03:11.635 --> 03:12.940
No. No. No!

03:13.463 --> 03:14.955
Fine. Well, it's your funeral.

03:15.815 --> 03:18.250
Move your arse! The custody
clock's running down.

03:23.393 --> 03:25.610
Ed Burnett. He's at
the scene, just had a scrap,

03:25.650 --> 03:27.291
clothes are covered in grass and mud.

03:27.448 --> 03:28.506
He's always obsessed with Trish.

03:28.530 --> 03:30.450
- He's gotta be frontrunner.
- Yep. Agreed.

03:30.490 --> 03:33.737
- Except...
- Except? What do you mean except?

03:33.893 --> 03:36.681
Beth called me yesterday. They tried
to talk to the other woman

03:36.706 --> 03:38.978
who was attacked and she's not
willing to disclose.

03:39.003 --> 03:41.751
But she did say she was attacked
after her car broke down.

03:41.776 --> 03:44.635
She was walking home, as the
breakdown service never turned up.

03:44.660 --> 03:46.420
- Which breakdown service?
- They didn't ask,

03:46.449 --> 03:49.174
but we both know Jim Atwood
runs a breakdown service.

03:49.542 --> 03:52.456
We're about to interview Ed Burnett.
You're muddying the waters!

03:52.496 --> 03:54.605
We've struggled to find a link
between the attack on Trish

03:54.629 --> 03:56.932
and the other two women,
and maybe Jim is that link.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.296
Let me see what records he keeps

03:59.336 --> 04:01.177
for breakdown customers
while you interview Ed.

04:01.349 --> 04:03.349
Fine. Just hurry up.

04:05.378 --> 04:06.378
Oi!

04:30.154 --> 04:31.154
Mark.

04:35.661 --> 04:36.951
Hi, Dad.

04:40.689 --> 04:42.748
A fisherman reported your boat empty.

04:44.052 --> 04:45.505
They called a lifeboat out.

04:48.412 --> 04:51.029
They found you in the water
unconscious with hypothermia.

04:52.706 --> 04:54.973
Another ten minutes they reckon
you'd have drowned.

04:58.220 --> 04:59.651
I was with Dan.

05:04.432 --> 05:05.455
What happened?

05:06.486 --> 05:07.541
Where have you been?

05:09.802 --> 05:11.080
I saw Joe...

05:16.141 --> 05:17.471
...and I talked to him.

05:20.037 --> 05:21.377
There's nothing now.

05:24.869 --> 05:26.104
There's us.

05:29.955 --> 05:33.049
I bought the breakdown
truck at auction a few years back.

05:33.086 --> 05:34.726
You get paid twice, you see:

05:34.751 --> 05:36.991
once for the call-out,
and once to fix the motor.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.596
Who answers the calls?

05:39.151 --> 05:41.911
They either come in here or I
get them diverted to my mobile.

05:43.283 --> 05:45.315
Do you keep a record
of everyone who calls?

05:45.933 --> 05:47.493
No, not always.

05:47.518 --> 05:50.291
Although everyone we go out to
will be up in the invoice books.

05:50.696 --> 05:53.377
I'd like to take a look at the
last two years' records, please.

05:54.616 --> 05:55.616
What, now?

05:56.581 --> 05:57.791
Yes. Now, please.

05:59.438 --> 06:02.658
How did your party suit get
grass and mud stains on it?

06:06.189 --> 06:07.645
I'd walked away from Jim...

06:08.608 --> 06:10.182
didn't really know where I was going.

06:11.256 --> 06:12.549
I was all wound up...

06:13.252 --> 06:15.315
ended up in the woods,
the other side of the lake.

06:17.828 --> 06:19.104
I was walking...

06:19.658 --> 06:22.963
and I slipped and I fell
all the way down the bank.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.783
What time was this?

06:27.492 --> 06:29.972
Funny thing, when I
was on my arse in the mud,

06:30.065 --> 06:31.656
didn't think to check my watch.

06:31.696 --> 06:34.479
Can I make a wee suggestion, Ed?
Lay off the smart-arse replies.

06:34.504 --> 06:36.424
Just keep it simple, and honest, yeah?

06:40.932 --> 06:43.936
Ian Winterman er,
says he had to talk to you

06:43.976 --> 06:45.816
about sexually harassing his wife.

06:46.899 --> 06:49.099
Absolutely not true.

06:51.908 --> 06:52.987
Why'd he say it, then?

06:53.955 --> 06:55.475
We'd had a works do.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.346
There was dancing,
it was getting lively.

06:58.470 --> 07:01.350
I was dancing with Trish,
probably closer than I should.

07:03.302 --> 07:05.776
If she was so bothered,
why did she keep working for me?

07:07.504 --> 07:09.033
Do you know a Laura Benson?

07:10.717 --> 07:11.830
Don't think so.

07:12.156 --> 07:13.698
Ever been to Abbots Chapel?

07:14.586 --> 07:15.987
Driven through it, course.

07:16.158 --> 07:18.656
- Been at the pub there?
- Not that I'm aware of.

07:18.696 --> 07:20.268
What's this got to do with Trish?

07:20.971 --> 07:24.541
What were you doing on
Saturday 7th of June, 2014, Ed?

07:25.401 --> 07:26.856
That's two years ago.

07:27.002 --> 07:28.002
I know.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.338
Off the top of my head,
probably in the shop.

07:30.420 --> 07:31.780
We're open seven days.

07:31.930 --> 07:34.570
- What about 2am on the 8th?
- I'd have been in bed.

07:34.729 --> 07:36.213
- Alone?
- Yes.

07:36.299 --> 07:39.136
All right. What about
Thursday 28th of May, 2015?

07:39.176 --> 07:40.260
I don't know!

07:40.867 --> 07:43.643
I live behind the shop. It takes
me 50 steps to get to work.

07:43.893 --> 07:45.338
The shop is my life.

07:46.536 --> 07:50.976
I wish I could make you understand,
that I would never hurt Trish.

07:54.268 --> 07:55.268
Are you sure?

07:58.088 --> 08:00.936
What if Trish told Ed
she was thinking of leaving?

08:00.976 --> 08:03.256
We know that he's in
love/obsessed with her.

08:03.296 --> 08:05.776
We know he relies on her,
feels he can't live without her.

08:05.816 --> 08:07.656
What if Ed thought
he was gonna leave her?

08:07.838 --> 08:09.216
What if she told him that night?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.536
- But it's supposition...
- It's investigation!

08:11.576 --> 08:13.216
- I'm theorising!
- Ellie's right.

08:13.256 --> 08:16.296
It's supposition. And you're out of
time. We have to let him go.

08:16.336 --> 08:18.877
- I am nearly there with him.
- Nearly isn't any good.

08:19.576 --> 08:21.616
Do you currently have
sufficient evidence

08:21.656 --> 08:25.296
to persuade the CPS to
charge Ed Burnett with rape?

08:28.517 --> 08:30.020
I'm sorry. 30 seconds. Sorry.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.743
How you doing, sweetheart?

08:33.971 --> 08:36.360
Can you take me to the station
this morning, please?

08:38.140 --> 08:39.275
I don't wanna do that.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.868
Dad, don't make this difficult.

08:47.451 --> 08:49.635
OK, I'll be there in 30 minutes.
If you're sure.

08:50.536 --> 08:51.643
If you're really sure.

08:53.135 --> 08:54.135
See you then.

08:56.539 --> 08:57.539
OK, bye.

09:03.308 --> 09:04.308
You all right?

09:07.823 --> 09:09.213
So what's it going to be, Alec?

09:14.526 --> 09:17.338
I'm gonna ask the custody
sergeant to release you on bail.

09:17.816 --> 09:20.776
I'll ask for conditions to be put
into place during your bail time,

09:20.816 --> 09:23.376
namely that you cannot
contact Trish Winterman

09:23.416 --> 09:26.056
or members of her family,
either directly or indirectly.

09:26.096 --> 09:27.816
And that you don't
go round to her house

09:27.856 --> 09:29.518
or the house of any family members.

09:32.581 --> 09:35.502
People round here are anxious
and you're playing into that.

09:36.491 --> 09:37.771
It's too sensational.

09:37.796 --> 09:40.876
Too... what do they call it...
clickbaity.

09:41.056 --> 09:43.057
Oh, Maggie, I'm sorry you're not happy.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.205
Plus, to the side of a story
about rape...

09:46.269 --> 09:49.033
you're running a sidebar
of women in bikinis?

09:49.198 --> 09:52.856
And then promoter stories
about the ten hottest WAGS

09:52.896 --> 09:54.216
and weather girls!

09:54.256 --> 09:55.856
We are funded by advertising.

09:55.896 --> 09:58.127
You can choose
what advertising to take!

09:58.522 --> 10:01.962
A newspaper's identity is about
what money you accept from where.

10:02.549 --> 10:03.669
It's not like that any more.

10:03.696 --> 10:05.862
It's all algorithms and analytics.

10:06.112 --> 10:09.336
Oh, so... so our reporting
of a sexual predator

10:09.376 --> 10:12.813
is being subsidised
and framed by soft porn.

10:12.838 --> 10:15.291
It's just pictures. It's nothing
you can't see on a beach.

10:15.729 --> 10:17.087
God's sake, Caroline!

10:17.112 --> 10:19.496
How can you call yourself
a feminist and let this pass?

10:19.536 --> 10:21.299
I don't call myself a feminist.

10:24.155 --> 10:25.932
Please tell me you're not the future?

10:32.510 --> 10:34.576
- Shit.
- You all right?

10:37.705 --> 10:38.940
Dad, what are you doing?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.596
- Stay here.
- Dad!

10:42.426 --> 10:44.112
Police! Shut up!

10:46.212 --> 10:48.448
Enjoying yourself, boys? Get up!

10:49.347 --> 10:50.369
Stand up!

10:53.283 --> 10:55.723
Who of you shared the photos of
my daughter around the school?

10:56.056 --> 10:58.744
- Dunno what you mean.
- Oh, aye, you do.

10:59.354 --> 11:02.291
You boys, you wee babies,
that think they're men...

11:03.316 --> 11:04.604
...you hurt my girl.

11:05.068 --> 11:08.760
So from now on I am gonna be
watching everything you do.

11:09.456 --> 11:11.596
I'm gonna be watching
everything your parents do,

11:11.621 --> 11:13.151
everything your family does.

11:13.791 --> 11:17.431
If any one of you even so much
as belch when you shouldn't,

11:17.682 --> 11:19.082
I will be there.

11:19.362 --> 11:22.260
- Are you threatening us?
- No, son, I'm instructing you.

11:22.285 --> 11:24.005
Do you know what I do in my job? Do you?

11:24.083 --> 11:25.549
I deal with murderers,

11:26.088 --> 11:28.416
and brutal thugs, and sex offenders.

11:28.456 --> 11:30.816
And I win. I get the better of them.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.093
So don't for a second imagine

11:33.118 --> 11:35.801
I will break a sweat
getting you in line.

11:37.976 --> 11:41.176
Any of you come near,
in fact, you even talk to...

11:41.216 --> 11:45.377
no, no, you even talk about
my daughter ever again...

11:45.893 --> 11:48.487
...let alone do anything
to make her unhappy,

11:48.512 --> 11:53.056
I will find you, and I will cut
your tiny little cocks off.

11:53.096 --> 11:55.096
You can't say that to us.
You're the police.

11:55.213 --> 11:56.455
I'm a father.

11:58.056 --> 12:01.424
And I will do whatever is necessary
to protect my daughter.

12:04.902 --> 12:06.471
Right, piss off!

12:11.312 --> 12:12.643
Let's see your ticket.

12:15.893 --> 12:17.862
- Dad!
- You're staying here.

12:18.296 --> 12:20.377
Miller, I'm busy...

12:20.619 --> 12:22.216
Nish just spoke to Laura Benson.

12:22.256 --> 12:25.362
She used Atwood's breakdown
services just before the attack.

12:26.143 --> 12:29.296
I'm just saying it's a lot of
money to spend on a weekly shop.

12:29.336 --> 12:30.336
It's not real...

12:35.460 --> 12:37.987
- Go inside, Cath.
- No.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.136
Can you not just leave us alone?

12:41.176 --> 12:42.913
We've got a few new questions.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.906
Do you want to put the shopping down?

13:01.029 --> 13:02.841
- You all right, Mum?
- Yeah.

13:03.532 --> 13:06.239
Do you mind waiting here with
Lizzie while I talk to your dad?

13:07.747 --> 13:08.747
Mum?

13:12.669 --> 13:14.052
Why aren't we enough?

13:21.521 --> 13:23.269
What did you expect to get from him?

13:23.411 --> 13:27.109
I just needed...
I needed to hear Joe say it.

13:27.286 --> 13:31.255
You know, confess properly,
like he never would in court.

13:32.599 --> 13:34.152
I tried to record him on my phone,

13:34.177 --> 13:36.599
so I could give it to the
police, but he took it off me.

13:38.896 --> 13:40.146
So what did he say?

13:42.013 --> 13:43.450
He just told me everything.

13:45.154 --> 13:47.067
You know, how... how Dan died.

13:49.325 --> 13:50.739
And then he apologised.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.333
Right.

13:55.812 --> 13:57.708
So is it done?
Did you get what you needed?

14:00.849 --> 14:01.709
Mark?

14:01.749 --> 14:03.442
What do you want me
to say to that, Beth?

14:04.305 --> 14:05.497
That I'm all fine?

14:09.803 --> 14:11.349
Did you mean to kill yourself?

14:21.789 --> 14:23.489
I'm so tired, Beth.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.200
I can't see anything ahead.

14:28.915 --> 14:32.349
You know, it'd just be... easier
if all this went away.

14:36.029 --> 14:38.191
Do you not think
you could talk to us? To me?

14:38.216 --> 14:40.349
We did talk. We talked all the time.

14:40.389 --> 14:41.560
And it never helped.

14:45.414 --> 14:47.247
I... I wanted to do something.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.317
I'm so sorry you feel this way.

14:53.966 --> 14:55.552
I'm sorry you're lost.

14:56.302 --> 14:57.911
I'm sorry you feel alone.

14:58.489 --> 15:01.146
I am listening to you,
I'm hearing everything you say.

15:01.615 --> 15:04.560
But, Mark, your grief
is still overwhelming you.

15:06.244 --> 15:09.263
Please believe me, there are
people who can help you.

15:10.069 --> 15:12.069
- I've tried.
- But it's different now.

15:12.109 --> 15:14.028
You've never been in this place before.

15:14.309 --> 15:16.928
Put things to rest.
And live in the present.

15:16.953 --> 15:18.114
Please.

15:46.006 --> 15:48.591
Haven't heard if they've talked
to Dad about your laptop?

15:52.138 --> 15:53.226
We could go out.

15:53.372 --> 15:55.372
I don't want to go out.
I don't want to see anyone.

15:56.911 --> 15:58.966
- We could go for a walk?
- No!

16:03.130 --> 16:04.989
Well, what if he's watching?
And follows us?

16:05.029 --> 16:07.636
- What if he sees you?
- It won't happen!

16:07.661 --> 16:08.911
How do you know?

16:09.072 --> 16:11.052
I never thought any of this
would happen to me.

16:13.083 --> 16:15.378
It's not just me. People
are saying the same thing.

16:15.403 --> 16:17.146
On Facebook, on all the chat groups:

16:17.210 --> 16:19.250
don't go out round here
if you're a woman.

16:19.778 --> 16:21.869
Nobody feels safe.
Everywhere's closing early.

16:21.909 --> 16:24.003
I mean, how is he allowed to do that?

16:24.028 --> 16:26.528
How is he allowed
to control our lives like this?

16:31.614 --> 16:33.589
Jim, can you tell me where you were

16:33.629 --> 16:36.442
on Thursday 28th of May, 2015?

16:37.677 --> 16:39.069
That's over a year ago.

16:39.226 --> 16:40.746
How do you expect me to remember that?

16:42.069 --> 16:43.294
Were you in the area?

16:44.606 --> 16:45.927
As far as I remember.

16:46.356 --> 16:48.036
I'd have been at the garage
during the day.

16:48.103 --> 16:49.114
And in the evening?

16:50.994 --> 16:53.634
I'd have gone home.
If it was a normal day.

16:54.829 --> 16:58.052
What about Saturday 7th of June, 2014?

16:58.949 --> 17:00.911
- What? Going back two years?
- Yeah.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.549
Same answer. Garage and home.

17:06.374 --> 17:08.614
- Ever been to Abbots Chapel?
- Yeah.

17:10.775 --> 17:12.535
Ever drink in The Rising Sun there?

17:13.497 --> 17:14.833
Couple of times, yeah.

17:14.981 --> 17:18.105
Ever done any breakdown or
repair work for a Laura Benson?

17:21.903 --> 17:24.911
I don't keep the name of every person
I've done work for, in my head.

17:25.387 --> 17:26.949
You tell me the car, then maybe.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.716
Red Renault Clio.

17:30.389 --> 17:32.189
Red Clio, er...

17:34.692 --> 17:35.692
Erm...

17:42.183 --> 17:43.341
Er... Kingsbere.

17:44.149 --> 17:45.149
Yeah.

17:46.069 --> 17:49.130
Yeah, 30s, long hair, pretty.

17:50.646 --> 17:52.294
If it's the girl I'm thinking of.

17:52.829 --> 17:54.646
Yeah, she broke down. Er...

17:55.149 --> 17:57.229
I picked her up, took her car
back to the garage

17:57.269 --> 17:58.427
and then I drove her home.

17:59.231 --> 18:01.707
I dunno when this was, though.
About a year back?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.185
June 2014.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.341
Where you going with this?

18:10.414 --> 18:12.489
You told me this was about Trish.

18:13.329 --> 18:14.911
We're just trying to get to the truth.

18:20.356 --> 18:21.709
Didn't like that, did he, Miller?

18:21.749 --> 18:23.231
Looked proper rattled.

18:23.919 --> 18:26.388
You seem much happier.
What happened with Daisy?

18:26.749 --> 18:29.167
- Tore up her ticket.
- You took my advice!

18:29.192 --> 18:30.525
- You know what I realised?
- What?

18:30.549 --> 18:32.989
- I'm too nice to people.
- No, that's...

18:33.029 --> 18:35.029
Never works, being nice.
I'm done with it.

18:35.069 --> 18:36.958
Got 'em queuing up for you
today, have you?

18:37.048 --> 18:39.302
There's another one waiting,
interview room two.

18:42.864 --> 18:46.606
OK, erm... my wife's computer.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.349
That you took off me.

18:48.864 --> 18:49.919
I...

18:52.327 --> 18:54.153
Sorry, this is quite embarrassing.

18:54.528 --> 18:56.266
I installed some...

18:56.291 --> 19:00.498
I think the official term
is spyware... on it.

19:03.829 --> 19:07.149
You've been snooping
on your wife via her laptop?

19:07.755 --> 19:09.825
It gave me access to her webcam.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.525
So I could check in on her
and see what she was up to.

19:12.549 --> 19:13.833
Why would you wanna do that?

19:13.919 --> 19:16.389
She often leaves it open, and on sleep,

19:16.429 --> 19:19.739
and this software
accesses the in-built camera.

19:20.058 --> 19:21.724
I didn't realise how easy it was.

19:23.435 --> 19:25.731
Talk us through
how you installed the spyware.

19:28.153 --> 19:31.364
Well, I... I Googled it.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.567
"How to intercept a webcam."

19:34.138 --> 19:35.789
I downloaded the software.

19:35.829 --> 19:38.247
And there's an installer,
and you click on that.

19:38.544 --> 19:40.731
And it sets itself up,
and away you go, really.

19:41.536 --> 19:43.388
Using Trish's own user account?

19:46.229 --> 19:47.903
Yeah, yes...

19:49.177 --> 19:53.216
We... we always knew
each other's passwords.

19:54.153 --> 19:56.778
You're lying to us, Mr. Winterman.
We don't have time for that.

19:58.552 --> 19:59.829
- What?
- 15 minutes ago,

19:59.869 --> 20:03.028
I got emailed a forensic breakdown
of the contents of that computer.

20:03.638 --> 20:06.677
The spyware wasn't installed
using Trish's user account.

20:07.023 --> 20:08.704
Didn't get installed
the way you described.

20:10.099 --> 20:12.003
Hmm... right.

20:12.028 --> 20:14.402
You've come here and confessed
to something you didn't do.

20:14.427 --> 20:15.589
But you have knowledge of.

20:15.629 --> 20:17.149
Which means someone else was involved.

20:17.536 --> 20:19.549
- I can't tell you who that is.
- Why not?

20:19.589 --> 20:21.427
I promised I'd keep
their name out of it.

20:21.589 --> 20:24.021
Have you forgotten what's
happening? Your wife was raped.

20:24.046 --> 20:26.013
We're trying to find
the person responsible.

20:26.469 --> 20:29.396
What's the matter with you?
Do you have no shame?

20:36.888 --> 20:38.449
All right. Here's what you're gonna do.

20:38.513 --> 20:40.869
You're gonna take a long walk
and a few deep breaths,

20:40.909 --> 20:42.909
and then you'll call us,
and give us the name

20:42.949 --> 20:44.869
of the person who installed
that spyware for you.

20:45.864 --> 20:47.645
If you haven't done that
by the end of the day,

20:47.669 --> 20:49.029
I will come looking for you,

20:49.069 --> 20:51.229
and I will bring you
back in here, under arrest.

20:51.269 --> 20:52.466
Do we understand each other?

20:59.208 --> 21:01.648
- Where did you hear?
- Harbour Master.

21:01.880 --> 21:03.669
Don't worry, he's very discreet.

21:07.109 --> 21:08.247
Is Mark all right?

21:09.564 --> 21:10.564
What happened?

21:11.518 --> 21:12.630
Was it an accident?

21:14.771 --> 21:15.771
Deliberate.

21:16.669 --> 21:19.800
- Oh, God. Beth, I'm so sorry.
- Can you keep it out of the paper?

21:19.825 --> 21:21.466
I can't bear people talking about us...

21:21.491 --> 21:22.536
I've already spiked it.

21:22.744 --> 21:25.372
What you don't print
is as important as what you do.

21:26.005 --> 21:27.169
Thanks, Maggie.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.216
We're going to see him again later.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.949
I'm just grateful
they got to him in time.

21:32.989 --> 21:35.091
What does it mean? For him?

21:35.935 --> 21:36.935
And you?

21:42.731 --> 21:44.583
All coming out the woodwork now,
though, eh?

21:45.716 --> 21:47.989
My old boss used to say,
an investigation's like a vice.

21:48.029 --> 21:50.029
You put all these people
in the middle of the vice,

21:50.231 --> 21:51.989
and you keep turning,
and applying pressure,

21:52.029 --> 21:54.029
sooner or later, they crack.
Just a matter of time.

21:54.114 --> 21:57.669
Thanks for that, Confucius. If that's
the case, why you are so antsy?

21:57.709 --> 21:59.030
You never bloody know
when it's gonna happen

21:59.054 --> 22:01.528
and how long it's gonna take.
That's what drives you mad.

22:02.231 --> 22:04.450
Nothing else came back from
the report on Trish's laptop,

22:04.474 --> 22:07.278
so if we have to arrest him later,
we'll go through his devices then.

22:07.442 --> 22:09.109
For now, keep on Jim Atwood.

22:09.149 --> 22:10.549
Let's look at everything we've got.

22:10.909 --> 22:11.909
OK.

22:12.661 --> 22:14.832
I keep thinking of his wife's
face when we took him away.

22:14.856 --> 22:16.469
It's like she wasn't even surprised.

23:43.109 --> 23:44.456
What do you want, Cath?

23:45.429 --> 23:48.378
I know this is a terrible question,
but just say yes or no.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.542
We're done, remember?

23:52.789 --> 23:54.238
When you were raped...

23:56.269 --> 23:57.777
...did he use a condom?

23:58.503 --> 23:59.534
What?

24:00.349 --> 24:03.469
I'm sorry, I...
I just... I've just gotta ask.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.069
Yeah.

24:25.722 --> 24:28.644
I put them in a freezer bag. I
thought they might be evidence.

24:30.613 --> 24:31.652
Condoms.

24:31.766 --> 24:34.644
I found them in my husband's car
and with the receipt.

24:36.554 --> 24:39.800
I'm bringing them to you
because I thought you should know.

24:41.394 --> 24:44.503
It's the time, you see. On the receipt.

24:46.050 --> 24:47.191
Five o'clock.

24:49.217 --> 24:51.777
On the day of my 50th birthday party...

24:54.232 --> 24:56.113
...my husband
was stocking up on condoms.

24:59.046 --> 25:01.238
We're gonna need to
search your house, Cath.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.126
OK.

25:04.902 --> 25:07.286
Would you be able to corroborate
your husband's movements

25:07.326 --> 25:10.066
on two specific dates
over the last two years?

25:10.808 --> 25:11.808
Yeah.

25:13.433 --> 25:14.886
He's sat there in the hospital.

25:14.926 --> 25:17.027
And I'm listening
to everything he has to say.

25:17.486 --> 25:20.286
And it takes all my training,
all the skills I've learned,

25:20.433 --> 25:21.926
to not just punch him in the face.

25:21.966 --> 25:24.472
- Right.
- I'm so angry with him.

25:25.550 --> 25:30.316
He has two daughters, one of
whom is barely three years old.

25:30.745 --> 25:32.550
How could he do this to them?

25:33.105 --> 25:36.766
He knows what loss feels like,
what it... what it rips out of you.

25:36.806 --> 25:39.042
You were right to go gentle on him.

25:39.766 --> 25:41.988
- He's hurting.
- We're all hurting.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.283
I'm hurting. You're hurting.

25:44.308 --> 25:46.113
The whole bloody world's hurting.

25:46.606 --> 25:48.667
But he has to make it about him.

25:49.366 --> 25:52.870
He takes all the oxygen,
all the attention.

25:53.573 --> 25:54.926
"Look at me, I'm Mark Latimer.

25:54.966 --> 25:57.519
And I am so much sadder
than the rest of you."

25:58.128 --> 25:59.644
And you know what that does?

26:00.628 --> 26:04.136
It leaves no room for me.
No space for me.

26:04.589 --> 26:06.366
He crowds out my grief.

26:06.406 --> 26:07.761
And my grief...

26:08.766 --> 26:11.691
my ongoing daily pain...

26:12.550 --> 26:15.046
...is as strong and as alive as his.

26:15.086 --> 26:16.646
But I don't let it win.

26:17.730 --> 26:20.261
He is selfish and weak.

26:24.105 --> 26:26.144
Part of me wishes he'd succeeded.

26:30.486 --> 26:32.081
And we're left to clear it up.

26:32.472 --> 26:34.675
His family. Like always.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.323
And I'm sick of it.

26:38.046 --> 26:39.046
Yeah.

26:40.548 --> 26:42.042
Yeah, I can understand that.

26:43.378 --> 26:46.213
Aren't you supposed to tell me to
see it from his point of view?

26:46.238 --> 26:48.166
Yeah, I am. But we've all done that.

26:48.206 --> 26:49.675
And it hasn't helped, has it?

26:52.086 --> 26:54.573
I've been with you both,
this whole journey.

26:55.878 --> 26:58.046
I've prayed for you, for Mark,

26:58.086 --> 27:01.628
for the girls, every single
night for the past three years.

27:03.606 --> 27:07.730
That you'll stay together, find
strength in each other and heal.

27:07.789 --> 27:10.149
But I don't know,
maybe that's too simplistic.

27:13.500 --> 27:14.643
But I get it.

27:16.284 --> 27:18.006
I understand what Mark's going through.

27:19.486 --> 27:21.441
We need to talk about Mark Latimer.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.933
I just heard what happened to him.
But not from you.

27:23.966 --> 27:27.245
No. We're not reporting it. That
family have been through enough.

27:27.417 --> 27:29.229
I'm sure you'll write it sensitively.

27:29.254 --> 27:30.814
I'm not writing it at all.

27:32.245 --> 27:34.406
You were the one telling me
you needed to be here

27:34.446 --> 27:36.086
to reflect this town.

27:36.402 --> 27:39.006
And then as soon as a story
comes along, you shirk it.

27:39.046 --> 27:41.566
Don't take the moral high ground
with me, Caroline.

27:41.863 --> 27:45.345
Our readers want to know what is
happening to Danny Latimer's family.

27:45.370 --> 27:47.744
The Latimers are a family in crisis.

27:47.769 --> 27:49.606
They need... and deserve...
their privacy.

27:49.646 --> 27:51.326
- It's not their choice.
- No, it's mine.

27:51.366 --> 27:53.042
I am still the editor here.

27:54.577 --> 27:56.457
Not if you don't publish this story.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.106
I am so proud to be a journalist.

28:05.972 --> 28:09.909
I've written some great stories,
and uncovered important truths.

28:10.894 --> 28:12.855
But I'm not writing about Mark Latimer.

28:14.386 --> 28:20.111
So, I hereby fire you, and your
declining industry from my life.

28:20.136 --> 28:21.323
I quit!

28:23.027 --> 28:26.006
And if I see anything about
the Latimers in the paper,

28:26.046 --> 28:30.326
or on the website, I swear, I will
slash your car tyres every week

28:30.366 --> 28:32.050
until they put me in a home.

28:34.886 --> 28:37.948
As the Americans say...
"Screw you, petal."

28:58.034 --> 29:00.034
Just catching up on some schoolwork.

29:02.037 --> 29:03.386
Sorry about earlier.

29:05.441 --> 29:06.886
It's gonna be all right, Mum.

29:25.698 --> 29:28.113
I'll go and get your stuff
over from the flat in a bit.

29:28.446 --> 29:31.277
- No, you don't have to do that.
- Yeah, I want to.

29:32.300 --> 29:35.847
I thought, I can sleep
here on the sofa,

29:36.253 --> 29:38.027
and you could have my room for now...

29:39.128 --> 29:40.900
- ...just so you get some rest.
- No, Chlo.

29:40.925 --> 29:43.050
Yeah, till you're better.

29:43.769 --> 29:47.519
Till the two of you,
you know, work everything out.

29:52.716 --> 29:54.097
It's good to have you back, Dad.

29:58.394 --> 29:59.863
You definitely all right with this?

30:01.347 --> 30:04.326
Yeah. Leave you to settle in,
give you some space.

30:05.698 --> 30:07.175
This is something we've gotta do.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.073
Miller?

30:21.277 --> 30:24.284
Do you know anything about this?
All over the local social media.

30:25.863 --> 30:28.245
No. Wow.

30:29.589 --> 30:31.275
There's nothing of any relevance here.

30:31.300 --> 30:33.159
Did you get anywhere
with Jim's breakdown records?

30:33.183 --> 30:34.743
The paperwork's diabolical.

30:34.768 --> 30:36.406
It'll take a day or two
to get through it.

30:36.446 --> 30:38.766
Cath's told us Jim went AWOL
towards the end of the night.

30:38.806 --> 30:39.925
He's got no alibi.

30:40.214 --> 30:42.686
He was buying condoms on the
afternoon of his wife's party.

30:42.726 --> 30:44.995
I've found them. The calendars.

30:46.230 --> 30:47.230
Erm...

30:47.870 --> 30:50.406
Those are the dates
that you were asking me about.

30:54.427 --> 30:56.144
So, I was away for both of them.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.667
He was here on his own.

31:08.253 --> 31:10.166
- Well, they're condoms.
- Your condoms.

31:10.206 --> 31:11.433
Found in your car.

31:12.699 --> 31:15.956
By your wife. She brought them to us.

31:17.107 --> 31:20.227
Along with this receipt from
a shop called Wessex Fuel.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.134
Showing that you bought those at 5:03pm

31:24.159 --> 31:26.046
on the Saturday of your wife's party.

31:26.175 --> 31:29.006
Directly on the route between
your house and Axehampton House.

31:29.046 --> 31:30.917
Who were you hoping
to use these on, Jim?

31:32.113 --> 31:33.956
Cos it certainly wasn't
your wife, was it?

31:36.823 --> 31:40.646
See, the problem for you is these
condoms match the brand of condom

31:40.686 --> 31:43.326
used by the man who
raped Trish Winterman.

31:45.086 --> 31:47.292
And there are condoms missing
from that packet.

31:49.043 --> 31:50.933
When did you use the condoms, Jim?

31:54.422 --> 31:55.722
Who did you use them with?

32:00.933 --> 32:03.056
Your wife also confirmed
that she was away

32:03.081 --> 32:05.402
on those other two nights
when women were attacked.

32:08.972 --> 32:10.366
So, unless you tell us otherwise,

32:10.406 --> 32:12.441
you don't have alibis for those nights.

32:15.386 --> 32:17.448
Starts to look like you're responsible.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.534
There was a waitress at the party.

32:28.823 --> 32:31.495
Young, fit. Saw her when they arrived.

32:32.511 --> 32:34.151
So I... went and got condoms.

32:36.296 --> 32:40.792
So you left the preparations of your
wife's 50th birthday party...

32:41.762 --> 32:43.002
...to go and buy condoms

32:43.027 --> 32:45.046
so you could have sex
with one of the waitresses.

32:45.456 --> 32:47.392
She was flirting with me,
as soon as she saw me.

32:47.605 --> 32:49.159
Did you have sex with her that night?

32:51.253 --> 32:52.048
Yeah.

32:52.073 --> 32:54.526
The same day that you had sex
with Trish Winterman.

32:57.589 --> 32:59.541
- Yeah.
- You proud of yourself, Jim?

32:59.566 --> 33:02.253
- No, I'm just a bloke. I like sex.
- How old was she?

33:04.089 --> 33:06.021
Dunno. 19, 20.

33:06.046 --> 33:07.550
Where did you have sex with her?

33:09.683 --> 33:11.902
In the woods. Up against a tree.

33:18.775 --> 33:20.415
Don't you look at me like that.

33:20.675 --> 33:22.285
Cos you'd have done the same,
if it was offered to you.

33:22.309 --> 33:23.988
No, I wouldn't.

33:27.863 --> 33:29.845
I don't subscribe
to your version of the world.

33:29.870 --> 33:31.782
But I worry about sending
my daughter out into it,

33:31.806 --> 33:32.806
with men like you around.

33:38.964 --> 33:41.103
Did you ask Trish to have sex
with you that night?

33:41.128 --> 33:42.417
Yeah, I think so.

33:43.144 --> 33:44.082
She said no.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.433
How did you feel about that?

33:47.551 --> 33:49.300
Like I had a better option.

34:01.608 --> 34:05.008
Hello, this is Ed Burnett,
please leave a message.

34:23.752 --> 34:24.752
Dad?

34:28.197 --> 34:31.011
You told them I was violent.

34:32.347 --> 34:33.746
Yeah, well, you promised me

34:33.786 --> 34:35.371
I didn't need to worry
about you being at the party.

34:35.395 --> 34:36.395
You don't.

34:38.114 --> 34:40.594
You were stalking a woman
who's been raped.

34:41.471 --> 34:44.362
- It's not like that!
- It's never like that, is it?

34:44.791 --> 34:46.308
It's never your fault.

34:48.931 --> 34:50.402
You've cost me my job.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.556
You have no idea what this
life is gonna do to you.

34:57.306 --> 34:58.786
I've only ever done my best.

35:00.303 --> 35:02.503
If I've lapsed or I've failed...

35:03.917 --> 35:05.652
...I've tried to put things right.

35:08.198 --> 35:11.113
Dad, if there's stuff you
haven't told me or the police,

35:11.253 --> 35:12.628
now is the time.

35:14.097 --> 35:15.683
Please don't hide anything else.

35:24.263 --> 35:25.300
Oi!

35:26.411 --> 35:27.542
What you doing?

35:28.308 --> 35:29.261
Get off!

35:29.323 --> 35:32.508
I was trying to work out where
Michael got the porn from. Here!

35:32.548 --> 35:34.291
Your computer. He got it from you!

35:34.316 --> 35:35.941
That is not what's going on.

35:36.323 --> 35:37.708
What are you even doing with it?

35:37.748 --> 35:40.788
- Look, everybody has it! All right?
- No, they don't. I don't!

35:40.828 --> 35:42.868
Right, and you're the
normal one, are you?

35:43.050 --> 35:45.588
Don't put anything on me.
You're such a liar.

35:45.628 --> 35:47.855
You think you're good at it,
like you enjoy it,

35:48.167 --> 35:49.402
and you're just not.

35:49.908 --> 35:52.238
This has been getting worse for years.

35:52.589 --> 35:54.108
What else aren't you telling me?

35:57.441 --> 35:59.191
Do you really wanna know
the answer to that?

36:06.417 --> 36:07.589
How are you doing?

36:08.588 --> 36:11.508
- Or is that a stupid question?
- Yeah, it's pretty stupid.

36:11.548 --> 36:12.548
Yeah.

36:13.308 --> 36:14.347
Can I come in?

36:24.620 --> 36:27.620
This is really bad of me, Trish,
I can't pretend otherwise.

36:28.069 --> 36:29.069
OK.

36:29.628 --> 36:31.222
So, I...

36:33.027 --> 36:35.708
I had some spyware
put on your computer.

36:35.748 --> 36:38.003
And I've been watching you
through your webcam.

36:39.753 --> 36:40.753
What?

36:42.073 --> 36:44.113
Why? Why would you even do that?

36:46.417 --> 36:47.534
Because I missed you.

36:48.648 --> 36:52.288
Because I... I blew what we had.

36:53.508 --> 36:55.748
And my life since then
has been so empty.

36:55.831 --> 36:59.261
There's this... chasm...
where you used to be.

37:01.394 --> 37:03.550
I just wanted to see you. Be with you.

37:09.808 --> 37:13.495
I... I was... I tried to take it off
but the police got wind of it.

37:14.087 --> 37:16.113
And I thought I should
tell you rather than them.

37:20.392 --> 37:21.952
Dad, what are you doing here?

37:22.808 --> 37:23.808
Oh.

37:24.316 --> 37:25.378
Oh, you know...

37:26.532 --> 37:27.589
You OK?

37:29.862 --> 37:32.300
This has to wait.
We're going out for a walk.

37:32.652 --> 37:33.988
What? No. No.

37:34.028 --> 37:35.722
- No!
- Yes, we are.

38:00.777 --> 38:01.847
What is this?

38:02.957 --> 38:03.957
Come on.

38:35.501 --> 38:36.792
Did you do this?

38:38.960 --> 38:40.386
He's not gonna win, Mum.

38:41.985 --> 38:43.550
We shouldn't have to be scared.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.175
Forgive me.

39:04.299 --> 39:05.605
If you forgive me.

39:08.868 --> 39:09.868
Look.

39:48.534 --> 39:50.948
I work for Chaz at the cafe
on the High street.

39:51.066 --> 39:53.345
He asked me if I wanted
to help them out with this do.

39:53.370 --> 39:55.028
I spoke to one of your
people about this.

39:55.068 --> 39:57.268
And did you tell them
about you and Jim Atwood?

39:58.433 --> 40:00.548
- How do you know about that?
- He told us.

40:00.573 --> 40:03.589
What? What's he going round
telling people for?

40:03.878 --> 40:05.885
What's that about? He ain't got
anything to be proud of there.

40:05.909 --> 40:07.019
How do you mean?

40:08.068 --> 40:09.828
Look, I'm not gonna lie. I like a DILF.

40:09.868 --> 40:12.080
- A DILF?
- A Dad I'd Like To...

40:12.105 --> 40:14.355
Oh... Yeah, got it. Thank you.

40:15.823 --> 40:18.668
We were setting up, erm...
had a bit of an exchange.

40:18.708 --> 40:19.823
He's naughty.

40:20.589 --> 40:22.534
And later, service was over...

40:23.120 --> 40:25.720
He was being a bit cheeky,
stashed me some champagne

40:25.745 --> 40:27.331
and asked if I wanted to go for a walk.

40:27.382 --> 40:28.385
What time?

40:29.468 --> 40:31.228
Half-elevenish. Maybe midnight.

40:31.745 --> 40:34.068
So we walked around,
ended up in the woods.

40:34.108 --> 40:36.388
We were getting on with
it but I made him stop.

40:36.428 --> 40:37.428
Why?

40:37.995 --> 40:40.315
He was getting rough. I wasn't
into it. I wasn't having it.

40:40.908 --> 40:43.777
- And how did he take that?
- He was pissed off.

40:43.948 --> 40:45.124
Didn't get his load away, did he?

40:45.148 --> 40:46.433
You know what they're like then.

40:48.511 --> 40:51.988
Jim Atwood was wandering the
grounds, sexually frustrated,

40:52.028 --> 40:53.748
with a pack of condoms in his pocket,

40:53.788 --> 40:55.441
around the time that Trish was raped.

40:55.909 --> 40:57.228
And he's still the only suspect

40:57.268 --> 40:59.730
who's ever come up with a DNA match
on Trish,

41:00.331 --> 41:02.484
even if it was from when they
slept together that morning.

41:02.508 --> 41:04.917
Vice is tightening, Miller.
Right around Jim Atwood.

41:06.363 --> 41:08.508
- Hello?
- Yeah. I'm calling to tell you

41:08.548 --> 41:10.902
who installed spyware on the computer.

41:21.817 --> 41:22.909
Hello, Leo.

41:29.402 --> 41:31.268
So you admit to installing spyware

41:31.308 --> 41:33.222
on Trish Winterman's laptop?

41:34.050 --> 41:35.261
Ian asked me to do it.

41:35.753 --> 41:38.152
So you just went along with it,
no questions asked?

41:38.597 --> 41:41.277
Yeah. I mean, they're married.

41:44.495 --> 41:46.456
But I... I know it was a bad thing.

41:47.188 --> 41:48.542
I should have fessed up earlier.

41:49.277 --> 41:50.277
Why didn't you?

41:52.232 --> 41:53.855
Didn't wanna drop Ian in the shit.

41:57.409 --> 42:00.456
He helped me through a lot when my
mum and dad were splitting up.

42:01.534 --> 42:02.964
It's hard when you're 15.

42:03.878 --> 42:05.433
He was my teacher at the time.

42:06.042 --> 42:08.284
Without him, I'd have thrown
myself on a railway line.

42:09.917 --> 42:12.097
Certainly thought about
it once or twice.

42:13.308 --> 42:15.268
He listened and he helped me.

42:16.386 --> 42:17.386
He saved me.

42:19.136 --> 42:20.284
I owe him a lot.

42:24.592 --> 42:27.253
What else aren't you telling
the truth about, Leo?

42:30.028 --> 42:32.472
I was at the party at Axehampton
for a bit that night.

42:33.433 --> 42:35.244
My girlfriend, Danielle,
she's basically ditched me

42:35.268 --> 42:37.028
cos I had her lie to you
about where we were.

42:37.068 --> 42:38.394
Your girlfriend was there too?

42:38.988 --> 42:40.948
She used to work
at the farm shop with Cath.

42:41.503 --> 42:42.745
She got invited.

42:43.441 --> 42:45.841
I dropped her off early that
evening, that's why I was there.

42:48.841 --> 42:50.316
I didn't tell you cos I was scared.

42:52.308 --> 42:54.468
I thought if you found out
about the computer,

42:54.508 --> 42:55.894
and knew that I was there...

42:57.472 --> 42:58.472
I dunno...

42:59.878 --> 43:01.128
It's a big thing, a rape.

43:06.597 --> 43:09.056
If my dad finds out about any of
this, I'm out on my ear.

43:09.081 --> 43:10.691
Job, home, everything.

43:12.895 --> 43:13.902
I'm really sorry.

43:16.698 --> 43:19.508
We can't charge him for installing
spyware on someone's computer.

43:19.548 --> 43:21.788
But he lied to us about
being at the party. Why do that?

43:21.828 --> 43:24.068
His alibi's blown: where
was he the rest of the evening?

43:24.108 --> 43:25.469
It's still not enough to hold him.

43:26.042 --> 43:28.244
Let him go, but we'll prioritise
finding out where he was

43:28.268 --> 43:29.839
the rest of the night.

43:30.620 --> 43:32.868
Bloody hell, the sock found
on the Axehampton estate,

43:32.908 --> 43:35.136
confirmed as a match for Trish's DNA.

43:35.659 --> 43:37.755
- Traces of her saliva.
- So it was used as a gag?

43:37.788 --> 43:41.081
More than that, there are traces
of one of our men's DNA on the sock.

43:41.620 --> 43:42.620
Who?

43:56.956 --> 43:58.188
What's so urgent?

43:58.228 --> 44:00.206
I was moving stuff and I found this.

44:02.586 --> 44:03.870
Never seen it before.

44:11.679 --> 44:13.394
Dad, these are bloodstains.
