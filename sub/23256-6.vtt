WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:02.703
- Previously on Nashville...

00:02.736 --> 00:04.705
- * Sweet revenge

00:04.738 --> 00:06.540
- You're amazing.
- Oh, thanks.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.177
- My name's Avery, and--
- We're looking for someone.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.178
- Somebody exactly like you.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.379
- Okay.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.681
- I guess I don't know much
about equine therapy at all.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.749
- It's transformational.

00:15.783 --> 00:18.519
Sean, you want to
give it a try?

00:18.552 --> 00:20.154
- No, that's okay.

00:20.188 --> 00:22.256
My nephew. He's staying
with us for a while.

00:25.726 --> 00:27.261
- I'm sorry.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.629
- Deacon, it's okay.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.370
- Maddie, can you
come here for a sec?

00:37.838 --> 00:39.440
- Can you please,
please come to this

00:39.473 --> 00:41.142
stupid Art Walk thing
with us, please?

00:41.175 --> 00:42.810
- I can't. I'm going
to hang out with Jonah.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.512
- Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.
Please?

00:44.545 --> 00:45.646
- I thought you
loved that thing?

00:45.679 --> 00:47.348
- Yeah, when I was 10.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.816
And definitely not
with Jake Maitland.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.484
- I thought you guys were good.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.186
- That does not mean
I wanna go hang out with him

00:52.220 --> 00:53.721
while Dad and Jessie are...

00:53.754 --> 00:55.789
- Oh, that's what
this is about.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.525
- No. It's definitely not
what this is about!

00:57.558 --> 00:58.859
This is about me being
dragged around

00:58.892 --> 01:00.561
like some little girl
that does not know

01:00.594 --> 01:01.662
how to take care of herself!

01:01.695 --> 01:03.131
- Okay.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.499
You're gonna survive,
I promise.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.067
I have to go get ready.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.842
- Dude, this is crazy.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.810
All anybody's talking
about is Alannah.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.279
- Awesome.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.581
- It's like
we weren't even there.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.582
What are you looking for?

01:21.615 --> 01:25.319
- My... vitamins.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.321
They were in my gym bag
and now they're not.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.822
Are you like 80?

01:28.856 --> 01:30.324
- Sorry I'm late, guys.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.727
- Hey, any, uh...
any word from Juliette?

01:33.761 --> 01:37.765
- No, and Cadence cried from
three a.m. to sunrise.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.533
- I'm sorry, man.

01:39.567 --> 01:43.204
- Yeah, it'll be fine.
It's only for two weeks.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.905
I'm just so mad that
she would leave that way.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.576
Anyway, you guys read
the reactions to the show?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.379
- Oh, yeah.
- Yep.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.647
- You know, at least people
are talking about us.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.283
Maybe she's just
what was missing.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.186
- I don't know.

01:58.219 --> 01:59.620
We just figured out our sound.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.522
Now she changes everything.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.756
- I hate to break it to you,

02:02.790 --> 02:04.292
but the genie's
out of the bottle.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.629
- Well, great.
What do we call ourselves?

02:08.662 --> 02:09.897
Three Men and a Lady?

02:11.665 --> 02:13.267
I'm seriously getting
worried about you.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.171
Listen, I get it.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.806
I mean, it's not
how we imagined this.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.741
But we'd be stupid
not to try it.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.378
Will, don't just leave.

02:24.412 --> 02:25.613
Come on, let's talk about it.
- Will, dude.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.914
- Oh, what is there
to talk about?

02:26.947 --> 02:28.516
Y'all made up
your minds already.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.391
- So now we're gonna
attach our family appliques

02:37.425 --> 02:39.260
to our quilt tops.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.562
- This looks just beautiful.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.863
Do you mind if I join you?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.632
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.434
What y'all got going on here?

02:46.467 --> 02:49.803
- Anyone wanna tell Scarlett
about their riding blankets?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.306
Kaitlyn
How about you?

02:54.575 --> 02:55.909
All right.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.478
Well, make sure you get
both layers of fabric

02:57.511 --> 02:58.946
with each stitch.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.915
And make sure your stitches
are evenly spaced.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.254
- I know who you are.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.790
- You're from the band,
The Exes?

03:09.823 --> 03:12.326
- I was.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.462
- Will you sing
for us sometime?

03:16.630 --> 03:19.567
If y'all finish
your projects there,

03:19.600 --> 03:21.969
I reckon we can work
something out. Deal?

03:39.687 --> 03:41.322
- Hey, thanks for coming.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.990
- I can't believe it.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.992
- My mother used to play
"Beneath Still Waters"

03:45.025 --> 03:47.695
over and over.
It kills me every time.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.397
- Very cool.
- Thanks.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.864
- You know, speaking of
killing it,

03:50.898 --> 03:52.833
the reason I wanted to meet
is our Twitter feed

03:52.866 --> 03:53.834
exploded after the show
last night.

03:53.867 --> 03:55.503
- Yeah.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.438
- That's great.
I'm not really into Twitter.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.507
- Oh, well, you're lucky,
but, yeah.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.741
It's great.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.343
- Well, congrats.
That's awesome.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.044
I thought you guys
were amazing.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.780
- Not for us.
For you.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.485
That's cool, I guess.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.886
- Yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.623
Well, I was talking to
the boys this morning

04:15.656 --> 04:17.858
and we all really love what
you bring in the group.

04:17.891 --> 04:22.363
Even debating whether we should
make you a bigger part.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.031
- Well, look, I'm flattered.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.933
But, you know,
you three have a thing.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.601
And I'm...

04:27.635 --> 04:30.037
- Hey, look, we all want this.
What do you think?

04:32.406 --> 04:35.909
- I think you three drank
too much whiskey last night.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.511
- Maybe not enough.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.481
Come on.
What are you afraid of?

04:40.514 --> 04:43.317
- I came to Nashville
to be a singer-songwriter.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.585
I don't wanna lose that.

04:47.421 --> 04:48.922
- You don't even
know my music.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.025
- Well, I know last night
was special.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.961
Come on.
What do you lose by trying?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.464
- I'll tell you what.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.432
Why don't you come
by my place tomorrow night?

04:58.466 --> 05:02.736
I'll play you a few of my songs,
and you'll see what you think.

05:02.770 --> 05:03.704
How's that sound?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.545
- Ah, yes.
Tiny headed horse.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.880
- And a dog.
- Look at that over there.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.815
That's kind of cool.
- I like that.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.784
- Oh, that's awesome.
- I've worked with that guy.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.118
Was it fun?

05:18.151 --> 05:20.621
- That was a good time.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.458
- I like that one.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.059
- Do you think that's
a Landry Major photo?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.695
- I don't know,
but it's great.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.663
- Can you imagine being in
the water like that

05:29.697 --> 05:32.065
at a full gallop with
a lasso in your hand?

05:32.099 --> 05:34.101
- I can't even walk and
chew gum at the same time.

05:34.134 --> 05:36.837
- You can just
feel the movement.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.840
You know, when I was a kid,
I was just obsessed

05:39.873 --> 05:41.542
with shooting for
the National Geographic.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.711
- Yeah.

05:45.446 --> 05:50.418
- Um, I don't know.
I guess...

05:50.451 --> 05:52.386
I guess life had other plans.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.021
- Wish my life had other plans.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.525
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I got carried away.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.759
Isn't this amazing?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.595
- Yeah, I guess so.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.165
Can we go?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.667
- Yeah, we can get outta here.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.702
- No. Actually,
I'd like to see more.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.073
- All right.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.642
Oh, man. Come on, guys.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.709
- It's all right, it's okay.
- Okay.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.977
- Sure.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.760
- Sweetie, it's me.
Can I come in?

06:36.564 --> 06:38.899
- I'm just about
to hop in the shower.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.070
- Okay. Well, maybe we can find
a minute tomorrow.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.137
We can talk?

06:47.675 --> 06:49.009
- Okay.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.210
- 'Night.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.745
- Goodnight.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.770
- There's our miracle worker.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.640
- It means you finally
motivated those two girls

07:19.673 --> 07:21.475
to actually do something.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.743
- Oh...
- It was very generous of you.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.744
Thank you.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.580
- I keep trying to
break free of that life.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.716
But it just keeps on
reigning me back in.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.684
- Things don't really go away
till they taught us

07:30.718 --> 07:32.085
what we need to learn.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.021
- Guess I'm a slow learner.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.624
- I doubt that.
You have a gift.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.659
How you choose to
use it is up to you.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.795
- Thanks.

07:44.197 --> 07:50.070
I saw him yesterday talking
to a woman in the parking lot.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.139
She was crying
and holding a child.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.775
It was one of the
saddest things I ever saw.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.877
- He was the sweetest boy
you ever met.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.178
And they broke him.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.881
- Sean was so talented.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.717
He could have given John Mayer
a run for his money.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.820
- In his case,
nothing physical.

08:06.854 --> 08:09.890
He just saw and heard things
that no one should see or hear.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.193
- His wife, Angela.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.128
High school sweethearts.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.997
I don't know how much longer
she's gonna hang in, though.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.301
So you see, Miss Scarlett,
we're all healing

08:21.334 --> 08:24.004
one way or another
together.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.907
Be patient with yourself.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.609
- Thank you.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.784
- Oh!

08:36.817 --> 08:38.652
- No.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.720
- Thanks.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.825
- Nothing.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.193
- It's not
what you're thinking.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.928
- Sure. Whatever.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.196
Is that my cologne?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.798
- Somebody's hangry.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.199
- Nobody's hangry, Romeo.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.034
Where you taking her?

08:54.067 --> 08:55.769
- I told you,
it's not like that.

08:55.803 --> 08:56.970
We're just going to her house.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.939
- Fast lane.
- No.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.941
To listen to her music
for our band, asshat.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.242
- Uh-huh.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.177
- To see if it
suits our style!

09:04.211 --> 09:05.713
- Just remember what
happened the last time

09:05.746 --> 09:07.147
you slept with a band member.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.149
- Hey, that is low.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.684
- I'm just saying
don't be an idiot.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.053
- I will not be an idiot!

09:18.826 --> 09:20.127
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.829
- I'm sorry.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.030
Everything is still a little
crazy with Zach gone.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.698
- It's okay.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.834
- I'll think about.

09:29.136 --> 09:30.337
Let's do this old school.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.839
- Oh...
- Yeah.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.173
- Wow, people are
gonna start talking.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.208
- Let 'em talk.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.012
- It was all right.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.648
- Well, that's convincing.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.318
I just can't stop
thinking about last night.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.388
- The way Daphne
was treating you.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.624
- Oh... what are
you talking about?

09:50.658 --> 09:51.992
- Come on now.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.661
She hardly said
two words to you.

09:53.694 --> 09:54.928
She was rude as hell.
- Oh, please.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.165
- She wasn't raised that way.
I can tell you that much.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.867
- Well, she's a teenager.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.969
Don't you think you're
making too much of this?

10:02.002 --> 10:03.704
- Funny, didn't you say
you didn't feel anything?

10:03.737 --> 10:07.074
- I mean, I noticed
something, sure.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.742
But it's not like I was
upset about it or anything.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.144
- That's 'cause
you're too nice.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.213
I just feel like I need
to head this thing off somehow

10:13.246 --> 10:15.148
or it's just gonna get worse.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.717
- You're gonna talk
to her about it.

10:16.750 --> 10:17.951
- I might, yeah.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.787
- Oh, wow.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.288
You know, she's just gonna
end up hating me even more.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.657
- She doesn't hate you, Jessie.
- I would hate me.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.928
- Look, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.098
But I think I need
to do something.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.866
- Well, I think we should
just forget about it

10:32.900 --> 10:34.201
for the rest of the night.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.772
- Okay.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.875
- * You're like swimming
in the river in the darkness *

10:41.909 --> 10:44.878
* Never have to question
where my heart is *

10:44.912 --> 10:49.249
* No need to test the water,
I just jump right in *

10:51.118 --> 10:53.453
* We're washing every worry
in the water *

10:53.486 --> 10:57.725
* You and I
in the middle of somewhere *

10:57.758 --> 11:02.830
* You and the moon
gonna take me now *

11:04.297 --> 11:08.301
* Ooh hoo hoo

11:08.335 --> 11:10.804
* We are just river swimming

11:10.838 --> 11:14.975
* Ooh hoo hoo

11:17.077 --> 11:22.716
* Ooh hoo hoo

11:25.418 --> 11:27.821
- Wow.
- Yeah.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.157
I can do better,
but you got the drift.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.825
- Seriously, I mean...

11:31.859 --> 11:33.994
Where'd you learn
to spin a story like that?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.063
- I don't know.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.831
I mean, it's kind of like
asking how I learnt

11:37.865 --> 11:40.834
to walk or talk or breathe.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.306
- My mother.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.276
Yeah, she, um...
she loved country music.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.510
Loved it.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.380
- Hated it.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.248
Called it hillbilly
funeral music.

11:59.152 --> 12:02.522
Each night when
he left for work,

12:02.555 --> 12:05.458
she'd pour herself a drink,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.527
and play her favorite records.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.798
Emmylou, Loretta...

12:10.831 --> 12:12.332
- Just a...

12:12.365 --> 12:14.067
- Oop!

12:14.101 --> 12:16.169
Joan Baez.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.438
You know, she totally
had a thing

12:18.471 --> 12:21.008
for strong resilient women.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.510
That's probably why

12:23.543 --> 12:25.512
nothing changed
when he left for good.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.416
She just kept
playing her records

12:29.449 --> 12:31.084
and doing the laundry

12:31.118 --> 12:33.220
and washing the dishes

12:33.253 --> 12:35.155
and making sure
I had what I needed.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.890
- Hmm.

12:36.924 --> 12:40.293
- Turns out all those women
were just singing

12:40.327 --> 12:42.295
what she was feeling.

12:42.329 --> 12:47.134
Kind of reminding her that
she wasn't alone, you know.

12:47.167 --> 12:50.503
That heartache is just
another rite of passage.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.207
- So that's
what the song's about?

12:54.241 --> 12:56.944
Heartbreak?

12:56.977 --> 12:58.011
- No.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.449
It's about...

13:02.482 --> 13:06.119
letting go of something
before you break it.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.454
Or before it breaks you.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.892
I guess that's
what I learnt from her.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.863
- Beneath still waters.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.105
- Um, so...

13:25.138 --> 13:26.573
- So...

13:31.611 --> 13:34.081
- The band.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.983
- Yeah.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.919
Yeah, I mean,
no, the band.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.520
Rehearsal tomorrow?

13:40.553 --> 13:41.989
Rework some of the songs
for the show

13:42.022 --> 13:45.225
and play the boys
a couple of yours?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.193
- Cool.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.096
- Yeah.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.400
I should probably get going.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.202
- Sure.
- Yeah.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.004
You know, I told
the boys I'd meet 'em.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.273
Uh, don't wanna be late.
- Totally get it.

14:04.377 --> 14:08.348
Hey, thanks for listening.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.616
It means a lot.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.085
- Happy to.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.487
See 'ya.

14:21.661 --> 14:24.164
Be smart, be smart.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.900
Be smart, yeah.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.911
Don't be an idiot.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.084
- I'm an idiot.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.452
For a million reasons,
I'm an idiot.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.887
But I'd be even more
of an idiot if...

14:49.389 --> 14:50.890
- Don't be an idiot.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.193
- Things are complicated.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.527
- They don't have to be.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.437
- Things could get
pretty messy, you know.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.978
You need to relax.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.681
- I just got out of
a relationship, so...

15:16.749 --> 15:19.219
- No, not like that.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.321
But I'm just...you know.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.991
You're incredible and
I'm just not ready

15:24.024 --> 15:25.292
to be anything right now.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.197
- Look, it's just...I think...

15:31.598 --> 15:33.400
- You think too much.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.414
- * 'Cause I caught a fever

16:21.448 --> 16:23.750
* I'm heading
towards the water *

16:23.783 --> 16:27.020
* Listen to
the voice inside *

16:28.588 --> 16:34.194
* No more wasting time

16:36.263 --> 16:39.666
* Do you want to meet me
where the sunlight shines? *

16:39.699 --> 16:42.035
* Oh

16:42.069 --> 16:43.503
* Oh

16:45.438 --> 16:49.109
* You know there will
never be a better time *

16:49.142 --> 16:51.344
* Oh

16:51.378 --> 16:53.613
* Oh

16:59.152 --> 17:01.020
- Hey. Got leftovers
if you want 'em.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.661
Hello.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.264
- Hi.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.632
- Think you could take
those out for a second?

17:14.467 --> 17:15.602
The other one?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.273
- I could be happier.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.276
- Means I'm not happy
about the way

17:23.310 --> 17:24.577
you treated Jessie
the other night.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.214
- I didn't do anything.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.548
- Well, first you ignored her.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.083
Then you mocked her, so...

17:31.851 --> 17:35.455
- No, she didn't complain to me.
This is me talking, all right?

17:35.488 --> 17:37.424
In this house,
we treat people with respect.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.425
You know that.

17:40.527 --> 17:41.661
Daphne, come on.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.130
We gotta figure
this out together.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.131
- There's nothing
to figure out.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.498
- Yeah, there is.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.666
- I just don't know
why you and Jessie

17:46.699 --> 17:48.135
couldn't have gone by yourself.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.803
- We can. I just wanted
you to come out

17:50.837 --> 17:53.140
so we could get to know
each other a little bit.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.343
- Because I think if you got
to know her, you'd like her.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.710
I know you would.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.679
- Why is it so important
to you that I like her?

18:01.514 --> 18:04.784
Because she's important to me.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.586
And you're important to me.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.588
I don't wanna feel like
I'm hiding some part of my life.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.458
- What about my life,
though, like...

18:11.491 --> 18:13.426
Does anyone care
about what I want?

18:14.661 --> 18:16.629
- Maddie has Jonah,
you have Jessie.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.665
And I'm just being dragged
along like a little kid.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.868
I hate it!
I just wanna be left alone!

18:21.901 --> 18:23.170
Why don't you understand that?

18:28.341 --> 18:29.676
- You are not a little kid.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.244
And we are not dragging
you around, honey.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.645
- Oh, it sure is
what it feels like.

18:32.679 --> 18:33.680
- Baby, look.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.215
Baby, you might not know this

18:35.248 --> 18:37.350
but you loom rather
large in my life, okay?

18:37.384 --> 18:39.686
You take up a whole
lot more room in my heart

18:39.719 --> 18:42.889
than some little kid.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.358
That means if you're upset,
then I'm upset.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.394
- Okay, then, I won't be upset.
Can we please just drop this?

18:47.427 --> 18:49.262
- Baby, if you wanna be
treated like a grownup,

18:49.296 --> 18:50.897
then we gotta solve
this like grownups.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.287
- Uh-oh.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.688
- Good morning.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.924
- It is for me.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.293
- I'm good.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.432
- You look like we
just eloped in Vegas.

19:25.465 --> 19:28.801
- Uh-huh.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.371
With a 70-year-old
Elvis impersonator.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.974
- Well, this wasn't
the smartest thing to do.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.877
- I'd like to think
you've done worse.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.946
- I'm serious.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.283
- Well, maybe that's
the problem.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.585
Maybe you shouldn't
be so serious.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.759
Maybe some things are
just meant to be fun.

19:52.792 --> 19:55.262
You have heard of
that word, right?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.634
Don't worry.
No one has to know.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.570
- I can handle that.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.506
- Prove it.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.013
Was he pissed?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.848
- Yeah. He said we have
to figure it out together.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.350
- That's such a Deacon
thing to say.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.620
This reminds me of
when Mom was dating Luke.

20:20.653 --> 20:22.722
- No.
It's completely different.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.491
I have no idea
what he sees in her.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.493
- She's sweet and
she makes him happy.

20:26.526 --> 20:27.927
Like...

20:27.960 --> 20:29.396
- I think she does.

20:29.429 --> 20:32.432
I mean, happier...
I don't know.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.667
Listen, all I'm saying is
we don't have to love her.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.336
We don't even have
to like her.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.037
She's Dad's life, you know.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.507
- Then why are they dragging
me along with them?

20:40.540 --> 20:42.609
- That won't be for much longer.
I promise you that.

20:42.642 --> 20:43.910
- It's already been too long.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.384
No, I'm glad you have it.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.521
- Let's just not
talk about it.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.456
- Okay.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.958
- One sec, it's Jonah.
I'll be right back.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.798
- * I was raised on
eight wheels humming *

21:05.832 --> 21:07.600
* Six strings strumming

21:07.634 --> 21:10.637
* All my dreams running down
a two-lane road *

21:10.670 --> 21:13.706
* Front porch swingin'
while Mama was singin' *

21:13.740 --> 21:15.942
* To somethin' on the radio

21:15.975 --> 21:18.545
* Even though we didn't
know the words *

21:18.578 --> 21:21.648
* We would always sing along

21:21.681 --> 21:24.517
* I was raised on a song

21:25.718 --> 21:28.621
- That was amazing.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.622
- Thank you.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.526
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.528
- Would y'all wanna
sing one together?

21:35.562 --> 21:36.963
Hey, Sean, you wanna join us?

21:36.996 --> 21:38.431
- No, thank you.
I got work to do.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.599
- We sure could use
another voice.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.800
- No. I'm okay.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.970
- He's so cute.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.772
Why does he have
to be such a freak?

21:45.805 --> 21:47.974
- Oh, sweetheart,
don't say that.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.343
We all know what it's like to
be afraid of something, right?

21:51.844 --> 21:54.347
Like everything.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.848
Don't get me started.

22:02.522 --> 22:04.123
- * You know
I don't wanna fight *

22:04.156 --> 22:07.727
* But I hate to see you go

22:07.760 --> 22:09.396
- * And another thing

22:09.429 --> 22:11.364
- * You know I don't
wanna fight *

22:11.398 --> 22:14.467
* But I hate to see you go

22:14.501 --> 22:16.369
- * And another thing

22:16.403 --> 22:18.738
- * If I can keep you around

22:18.771 --> 22:19.906
* By shouting you down

22:19.939 --> 22:21.374
* Well, all right

22:21.408 --> 22:23.643
* Love is loud

22:23.676 --> 22:25.412
- * Don't want to kiss you

22:25.445 --> 22:28.515
* 'Cause I don't want to
miss you too much *

22:28.548 --> 22:30.517
- * And another thing

22:30.550 --> 22:32.385
- * You know I don't
want to kiss you *

22:32.419 --> 22:35.622
* 'Cause I don't want
to miss you too much *

22:35.655 --> 22:37.624
- * And another thing

22:37.657 --> 22:39.125
* With all the people around

22:39.158 --> 22:40.893
* We might draw a crowd

22:40.927 --> 22:44.497
* Well, all right,
Love is loud, loud, loud *

22:44.531 --> 22:46.132
- * And another thing

22:46.165 --> 22:49.402
* And another thing
And another thing *

22:49.436 --> 22:52.171
* And another thing...

22:52.204 --> 22:55.174
- Hang on, hang on.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.011
- Uh, yeah. I'm just not
feeling it yet.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.647
- I mean, I could pull it
back if that helps.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.015
- I thought it sounded
pretty great actually.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.618
- Yeah, no.
It's just missing something.

23:05.652 --> 23:06.919
- I don't know. I was kind
of digging the interplay

23:06.953 --> 23:08.621
you had going
in that last chorus.

23:08.655 --> 23:10.657
You two look kind of
sexy together.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.425
- Almost too sexy.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.928
It's a joke.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.698
Even I wanna make out
with Will right now.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.900
- Uh, I am gonna
go grab a drink.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.880
- Please tell me you
didn't hook up with her.

23:36.483 --> 23:37.750
- Ugh, I knew it!

23:37.784 --> 23:39.218
- You've got to be kidding me!

23:39.251 --> 23:41.053
- Well, that didn't take long.
- Mm-mm.

23:41.087 --> 23:43.790
- I mean, that might be some
kind of record for you. Is it?

23:43.823 --> 23:45.525
- Okay, just slow down...

23:45.558 --> 23:47.026
- Sounds like you're the one
who needs to slow down.

23:47.059 --> 23:49.929
- Dude, Band 101!
Don't sleep with band mates!

23:49.962 --> 23:51.498
- I know. I know.
I'm an idiot!

23:51.531 --> 23:52.899
I didn't mean to!
It just happened!

23:52.932 --> 23:55.167
Guys, she's... she's amazing.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.505
Musically, musically,
she's amazing.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.107
And you two together,
it's awesome!

24:01.140 --> 24:03.743
I think we could really
put on a great show!

24:03.776 --> 24:06.078
Besides, it's just totally
casual, right?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.714
- It's never casual
with you, Gunnar.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.717
- Mm-hmm.
You pick the ring out yet?

24:16.155 --> 24:20.059
- Gunnar's deciding on
the encore for tonight.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.862
- Yeah, just, you know,
finalizing the set list.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.931
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.098
- From the top.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.234
- Yeah.

24:30.870 --> 24:33.172
- * There ain't nothing
that's more lonesome... *

24:33.205 --> 24:36.008
- And her life has been
completely turned upside down

24:36.042 --> 24:37.644
this past year.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.145
She's angry.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.212
- I know.

24:40.246 --> 24:42.181
- I don't blame her.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.984
- Well, she's 14, poor thing.
Like that's not hard enough.

24:45.017 --> 24:47.253
- Yeah, exactly.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.024
- Let's have a dinner
tomorrow night, all of us.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.526
Just talk it out.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.895
That sounds awful!
Are you serious?

24:55.928 --> 24:58.798
- No, I'm serious.
Get it out there, you know?

24:58.831 --> 25:00.800
See what happens.
I think... I think it'll help.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.134
- Yeah.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.036
- I think we might die.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.875
- I will protect you,
I promise.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.544
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.012
- Hey.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.714
- I didn't expect to
see this pretty face.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.315
- Oh, I'm still friends
with two of these idiots.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.017
Trying to figure out how not
to be weird with the third.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.319
It's so good to see
you two together.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.955
- Aw.
- Glad somebody thinks so.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.092
- Kid insurrection.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.260
- Ooh.
They'll get over it.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.262
Excuse me.
I need a very large beverage.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.966
- And a small world
was had by all.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.170
- Well, apparently nothing
short of the second coming

25:38.204 --> 25:40.773
of Clapton, Baker and Bruce.

25:40.807 --> 25:42.575
- Don't forget Highway 65
has first dibs.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.110
- Come on, man. It's all about
the music for me.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.177
You know that.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.847
Hello, Jess.
- Goodbye, Brad.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.617
- Ladies and gentlemen, give it
up for The Last Highways.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.260
- * You know
I don't want to fight *

26:01.293 --> 26:03.596
* But I hate to see you go

26:03.630 --> 26:06.232
- * Gotta go
- * And another thing

26:06.265 --> 26:08.134
* You know
I don't want to fight *

26:08.167 --> 26:11.738
* But I hate to see you go
- * Gotta go

26:11.771 --> 26:13.372
- * And another thing

26:13.405 --> 26:15.041
* If I can keep you around

26:15.074 --> 26:16.609
* By shouting you down

26:16.643 --> 26:17.944
- * Well, all right

26:17.977 --> 26:20.647
- I don't know.
- * Love is loud

26:20.680 --> 26:22.281
- * I don't want to kiss you

26:22.314 --> 26:25.818
* 'Cause I don't want
to miss you too much *

26:25.852 --> 26:27.754
- * Keep in touch
- * And another thing

26:27.787 --> 26:29.388
* You know I don't
want to kiss you *

26:29.421 --> 26:31.924
* 'Cause I don't
want to miss you too much *

26:31.958 --> 26:34.293
- * Keep in touch
- * And another thing

26:34.326 --> 26:36.028
* With all the people around

26:36.062 --> 26:38.064
* We might draw a crowd

26:38.097 --> 26:41.868
* Well, all right,
Love is loud, loud, loud *

27:02.221 --> 27:04.256
- * And another thing

27:04.290 --> 27:07.660
* And another thing
And another thing *

27:07.694 --> 27:09.829
* And another thing...

27:17.003 --> 27:18.004
- All right!

27:18.037 --> 27:20.439
- Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!

27:20.472 --> 27:23.342
- Thank you.
- There you go.

27:27.313 --> 27:31.818
- Brad Maitland.
Shiny New Records.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.219
A woman with your
talent shouldn't be

27:33.252 --> 27:35.054
surrounding herself
with boys.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.924
- Well, what if those boys
are my friends?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.929
- I'm the only friend you
will ever need, all right?

28:04.250 --> 28:07.419
- Hey.
Hey, man, how's it going?

28:41.053 --> 28:43.389
- I'm not following you.
I just saw you.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.057
I wanted to make sure
you're okay.

28:47.326 --> 28:50.062
- You should probably
be more careful.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.131
It's not safe
out here for you.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.800
- Come on, dude.
It's Nashville.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.434
I walk these streets
all the time.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.036
Besides, I don't see
you being too careful.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.840
- I did night patrols
in Kandahar.

29:00.873 --> 29:04.543
I'm pretty sure that
I can handle all of this.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.013
- You--

29:07.046 --> 29:08.380
Are You okay?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.982
- Never better.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.454
- I don't need
your pity, okay?

29:15.487 --> 29:17.456
- Well, I ain't
handin' any out.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.503
- Your voice was
beautiful today.

29:37.143 --> 29:40.246
- It was the prettiest thing
I heard in a long time.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.417
- Music means a lot
to you, don't it?

29:51.023 --> 29:52.091
Do you miss it?

29:53.225 --> 29:54.493
- You shouldn't be out here.

29:56.428 --> 29:57.864
- I don't need your pity.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.473
- So my thinking is between
the big numbers,

30:07.506 --> 30:10.476
we each do a song with you
to help bring it all together.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.211
- I like it.
- Yeah.

30:12.244 --> 30:14.313
- Well, I gotta get going.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.048
- Ah, yeah. Me too.

30:16.082 --> 30:19.118
This sitter is gonna
bankrupt me.

30:19.151 --> 30:21.120
Rehearsal Monday?

30:21.153 --> 30:22.955
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Monday.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.356
- Yeah.
- All right.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.925
Great show tonight.
- See you.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.093
- See you guys.

30:31.898 --> 30:33.499
- You were brilliant.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.568
- We were brilliant.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.537
- If you say so.

30:40.172 --> 30:43.509
- Don't get ahead of
yourself, soldier.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.177
- Ma'am, yes, ma'am.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.979
- Now that's what
I like to hear.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.319
So, Monday?

30:55.021 --> 30:55.988
- Monday.

30:58.124 --> 30:59.191
Hey, Alannah?

31:00.392 --> 31:01.493
You were brilliant.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.201
- I left the nightlight
on in the bathroom

31:09.235 --> 31:12.104
and just help yourself
to whatever you like

31:12.138 --> 31:13.339
in the kitchen.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.274
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.211
- Hey, why'd you ask if music
was important to me?

31:20.612 --> 31:22.281
- Well, you asked, but,

31:22.314 --> 31:24.350
it was like
you already knew.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.584
- Oh.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.055
I looked you up online.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.456
- I don't know.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.324
Just curious, I guess.

31:32.358 --> 31:35.027
It was stupid,
and I'm sorry.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.028
But I saw your
graduation performance.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.363
It was incredible.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.031
You're...
You're real talented.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.368
I think it was
on your Facebook.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.403
You were playing
with a friend.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.939
And his name's Billy, right?

31:46.973 --> 31:48.474
Here, I can show you.
- No, don't do that!

31:48.507 --> 31:49.942
Put it away!

31:51.077 --> 31:52.544
- Okay, okay, it's gone.

31:54.580 --> 31:58.250
I just meant to say that y'all
sounded really great together.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.319
- Yeah, we were.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.988
- I'm confused.
What's happening?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.922
- Well, he died.
That's what's happening.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.959
- I'm so sorry.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.064
Was that before you signed up?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.234
- No.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.203
We signed up together.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.039
He was with me in Farah.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.210
I watched his jaw get shot off.

32:27.713 --> 32:30.216
So anytime you wanna
rub my face in it,

32:30.249 --> 32:31.717
just keep going
on about my music!

32:31.750 --> 32:33.385
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
I didn't...

32:33.419 --> 32:35.621
- I don't play anymore.
You get it?

32:37.289 --> 32:38.357
That's done.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.097
- I get it.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.501
I'm really, really sorry.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.075
- Oh, please don't go.
It was my fault...

32:56.108 --> 32:57.276
- No, this is when it
gets real bad, okay?

32:57.309 --> 32:58.344
I should go.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.048
- Never mind.
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.216
- Please, please don't go.
You don't--

33:06.185 --> 33:08.587
You don't have to.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.123
I'm gonna go into my room.

33:11.157 --> 33:14.260
You can lie down and rest.

33:14.293 --> 33:16.528
Whatever you need to do.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.297
I'll be out of your way.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.410
I'm just wondering.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.215
Who does it help if you
give up what you love?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.608
- Hey, Dell, I know what
this looks like.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.477
But I found him downtown
last night

34:05.511 --> 34:07.379
and he was real drunk.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.814
And it was real cold,
so I took him home.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.582
- Did something happen,
Scarlett?

34:10.616 --> 34:12.451
- Nothing like that.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.086
I just found this video
of him online

34:14.120 --> 34:15.621
playing at his graduation.
His friend, Billy...

34:15.654 --> 34:17.756
- Oh...
- Dell, I'm so sorry.

34:17.789 --> 34:20.326
- Next time you wanna help,
just bring him straight here.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.828
I'm gonna go check on him.

34:22.861 --> 34:25.197
Get started on those stalls.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:30.469 --> 34:33.239
- Well, wonders never cease.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.607
- Whatever, man.
I told you, we're not a thing.

34:35.641 --> 34:37.643
- Mm-hmm.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.111
- Gah!

34:41.547 --> 34:43.382
Last night was insane.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.151
- Yeah, the crowd really
seemed to dig it.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.685
- More than dug it.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.387
How you feelin' about it all?

34:48.420 --> 34:50.889
- You know, I'm just
goin' with the flow.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.258
Seeing where it takes us.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.228
- Well, let's just say
I'm not sure which one of us

34:56.262 --> 34:57.796
is gonna regret
this girl more.

35:18.584 --> 35:21.687
- Well, this is wonderful.
Thank you so much.

35:21.720 --> 35:22.921
- Oh, chicken's
a little rubbery.

35:22.954 --> 35:24.590
But what are
you gonna do, huh?

35:24.623 --> 35:26.892
- No, it's great.
It's great, right, Jake?

35:26.925 --> 35:29.561
Jake?

35:29.595 --> 35:30.662
- Thank you.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.464
- No problem, buddy.

35:32.498 --> 35:35.567
- So I heard you guys partnered
up doing a project in class.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.369
How did that turn out?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.773
- It was fine, I guess.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.845
- A frog.

35:46.878 --> 35:50.216
I love frogs.

35:50.249 --> 35:52.751
- Yeah, we dissected it.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.454
It smelled like formaldehyde.
It was disgusting.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.457
Its legs were
like rubber and slimy.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.426
Then we cut down
its stomach and guts and...

36:00.459 --> 36:01.660
- Okay, all right.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.896
- Sorry, I brought that up.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.601
We're all here.

36:09.635 --> 36:12.304
Probably best we just
talk this thing out.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.241
Why doesn't
she have to be here?

36:15.274 --> 36:16.642
- Because this isn't
about her, sweetheart.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.344
This is about...hey!

36:18.377 --> 36:19.611
Daphne?

36:19.645 --> 36:20.879
Hey, where are you...
Daphne Conrad!

36:20.912 --> 36:22.281
Come back here right now!

36:22.314 --> 36:24.182
- Let me talk to her.
- Oh, boy.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.386
- I think I need to deal
with this, all right?

36:27.419 --> 36:29.755
- But I don't think
it's about you and Daphne.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.457
I think it's about
me and Daphne.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.326
Just let me try.

36:36.528 --> 36:37.696
- Yeah.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.607
- Go away!

36:48.640 --> 36:49.975
- You think you could
give me a minute?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.613
Then I promise I will
leave you alone.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.486
- Okay.

37:14.700 --> 37:17.569
Listen.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.438
I'm basically scared
all the time.

37:21.407 --> 37:24.576
I never really...

37:24.610 --> 37:27.379
felt like I was worth
much of anything

37:27.413 --> 37:29.548
because, honestly,
I was never cool

37:29.581 --> 37:32.818
and I wasn't
particularly smart.

37:32.851 --> 37:37.689
I wasn't talented,
so I made most of my decisions

37:37.723 --> 37:41.660
out of fear which turned out
to be a complete disaster.

37:41.693 --> 37:47.466
Which is why I am determined
not to do that anymore.

37:47.499 --> 37:49.735
But it's really, really tough

37:49.768 --> 37:51.537
because I'm still afraid.

37:55.006 --> 37:58.844
The thing is, I think that you
are such an incredible person.

37:58.877 --> 38:03.315
You are a beautiful
and talented artist

38:03.349 --> 38:05.717
and I see so much of
your mother in you.

38:08.754 --> 38:11.056
And I really wanted to get
to know you better

38:11.089 --> 38:14.860
and I guess that's probably
why I've been

38:14.893 --> 38:17.496
going about this all wrong

38:17.529 --> 38:21.567
because I'm just
scared, Daphne.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.003
I'm scared that I'm gonna
screw it all up

38:25.036 --> 38:26.838
and let everybody down.

38:26.872 --> 38:30.709
Jake and Deacon and you.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.513
- Yes, of course, you.

38:36.848 --> 38:40.652
Do you have any idea how much
that man downstairs loves you?

38:40.686 --> 38:44.456
You're his entire world

38:44.490 --> 38:47.793
and I feel like
I'm sort of messing that up

38:47.826 --> 38:49.861
for you guys, you know?

38:52.498 --> 38:53.865
- It's just really hard.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.000
- Of course, it is.

38:57.803 --> 39:00.772
Which is why you need
to hear this part.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.073
This was the part that
I was scared

39:02.107 --> 39:04.376
to tell you the whole time.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.343
But...

39:08.814 --> 39:11.883
You need to know that
I'm not trying

39:11.917 --> 39:14.119
to replace your mother, okay?

39:16.955 --> 39:20.626
I couldn't and I wouldn't.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.531
And I'm not trying to take
your father from you either.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.135
He has such a big heart,

39:30.168 --> 39:33.672
probably bigger than
any man I've ever met.

39:33.705 --> 39:37.075
And he has enough room
for you and Maddie

39:37.108 --> 39:39.778
and me and your mother.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.049
Forever, your mother.

39:44.082 --> 39:47.118
Which is a little daunting.

39:47.152 --> 39:50.422
But I'm trying to handle it.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.527
The thing is, what I want...

39:55.561 --> 39:58.497
and I really,
really want it...

39:58.530 --> 40:04.670
is just to be your friend...

40:07.573 --> 40:09.808
if such a thing is possible.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.811
- I'm sorry.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.488
I'm the troublemaker here.

40:32.531 --> 40:35.200
- Why is it every time I try
to do something good or right,

40:35.233 --> 40:37.769
it blows up in my face?

40:37.803 --> 40:39.705
- Happens to the best of us.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.840
- Dell, I did not mean
to make things worse.

40:41.873 --> 40:42.974
I truly didn't.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.477
- Walk with me.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.950
There's a verse by Leonard Cohen
that I've always loved.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.785
You know, one
where he talks about

40:53.819 --> 40:55.821
ringing the bells
that still can ring?

40:55.854 --> 40:57.155
- Yeah.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.758
- Well, the point is,
no one is perfect.

40:59.791 --> 41:01.560
Everyone is cracked.

41:01.593 --> 41:04.796
But it's the cracks that let
our light shine through.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.565
- So beautiful.

41:13.071 --> 41:17.543
- * Wasting time

41:23.081 --> 41:25.517
* 'Cause I caught a fever

41:25.551 --> 41:28.920
* I'm headin'
towards the water *

41:28.954 --> 41:33.659
* Listen to the
voice inside *

41:35.627 --> 41:39.064
* No more

41:39.097 --> 41:43.168
* Wasting time
