WEBVTT

00:25.660 --> 00:30.960
rioting today in a repeat of what happened just three weeks ago

00:35.200 --> 00:39.780
tensions are still rising with nuclear threats now coming from both sides.

01:38.420 --> 01:41.500
if it's okay with your mum you play with
this if you like

01:41.680 --> 01:43.180
Oh thank you that's very nice of you

01:44.000 --> 01:45.920
you're very welcome

01:48.360 --> 01:48.980
Jack?

01:50.540 --> 01:51.900
Jack Chyser it is you

01:52.280 --> 01:53.160
Claire?

01:53.920 --> 01:54.940
What are you doing here?

01:55.020 --> 01:57.200
Well, never mind that, how are you?

01:57.280 --> 02:00.780
it's been such a long time like
ten years as I saw you lost

02:01.080 --> 02:01.960
must be about that

02:02.420 --> 02:05.120
must be about that you haven't changed a bit

02:05.120 --> 02:09.380
The last time I saw you, you were in a band, what was it called?

02:09.680 --> 02:10.380
Death Pit

02:10.380 --> 02:12.920
That's the one. You were really good.

02:13.740 --> 02:14.860
We were terrible

02:15.340 --> 02:15.840
God

02:16.360 --> 02:18.660
Our best song was called suck on my sewage pipe

02:18.960 --> 02:21.500
Is that the one that you played at the charity show,

02:21.860 --> 02:25.060
Where all the the grannies have to be a ushered out and all the kiddies started crying?

02:25.060 --> 02:25.720
That's the one.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.660
So what are you doing with yourself now? Did you ever go to med school?

02:30.160 --> 02:33.120
I did indeed
I'm now Dr. Claire Stevens

02:33.500 --> 02:34.000
Wow

That's awesome

02:35.260 --> 02:36.820

music biz?

02:36.820 --> 02:40.860

I'm an IT technician

02:46.840 --> 02:48.200
So where you headed?

02:48.220 --> 02:49.960
Just took a job at weather
station

02:50.820 --> 02:52.260
The EKAF research centre?

02:52.500 --> 02:53.600
Yeah, that's it

02:54.100 --> 02:57.640
that's where I work
how long you gonna be with this for then?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.280
I'm just temping for six weeks

02:59.280 --> 03:01.200
Oh to think in last six weeks it is in

03:01.220 --> 03:04.300
the middle of nowhere and you do realize
there's no pubs there

03:04.420 --> 03:05.060
You what?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.740
excuse me sir I have an anomaly here

03:28.740 --> 03:31.500
I've told you before don't call me sir I'm

03:31.640 --> 03:32.420
not your boss

03:32.600 --> 03:35.980
sorry sir, Jack

03:36.380 --> 03:36.880
ah

03:37.020 --> 03:42.120
looks like a sensor drop out we usually
send this to tech but they left on the

03:42.120 --> 03:48.580
first transport this morning send it to
Colville let them deal with it

04:03.300 --> 04:05.820
Christmas bonus

04:05.820 --> 04:09.080
oh just in time so do
you have any plans for Christmas I bet

04:09.080 --> 04:10.560
you can't wait to get home

04:10.560 --> 04:12.110
Jack Chyser
to the medical Bay

04:12.110 --> 04:15.860
- Jack Chyser - the medical bed

04:17.380 --> 04:18.800
He won't be going anywhere

04:18.959 --> 04:20.100
he'll be here for Christmas

04:20.100 --> 04:22.420
oh no has he
been chosen for maintenance duty?

04:22.420 --> 04:26.720
volunteered for the past four years

04:27.840 --> 04:29.620
breathe in

04:29.620 --> 04:31.960
breathe out

04:31.960 --> 04:35.450
well Jack I think you'll survive till I
get back

04:35.450 --> 04:37.100
so how you doing

I'm sure Carter can get someone to cover

04:45.980 --> 04:50.500
No I told you I'm fine honestly

04:51.480 --> 04:58.360
Jack I'm not a psychologist but I think
yeah acrophobic we need to get you some support

04:58.560 --> 05:04.100
I'm not agraphobic, agraphobia is a
fear of the outside I don't fear it I

05:04.100 --> 05:08.940
just don't like it and besides I've got
everything I need right here

05:09.660 --> 05:13.660
well let's talk about this when I get back you should be getting yourself back upstairs

05:18.380 --> 05:20.420
Well say hello to Mike and kids me you

05:27.240 --> 05:33.920

please exit the building now

05:36.820 --> 05:39.040
We're off now Jack you're gonna be all right
on your own?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.359
don't worry about me go and

05:40.360 --> 05:42.920
enjoy yourselves I'll see you in the new
year

05:43.320 --> 05:44.120
See you Jack

05:45.200 --> 05:47.420

05:47.420 --> 05:49.809
yes I have locked down the facility

05:49.809 --> 05:53.960
Well let's get this party started
hit the music

05:53.960 --> 05:56.060
whoa

05:59.920 --> 06:04.280
sorry to spoil your fun jack but we have
an error with one of the server

06:04.280 --> 06:05.020
fine

06:11.220 --> 06:12.320
is that it Jim?

06:12.320 --> 06:14.619
no it's still not active

06:14.620 --> 06:17.900
Hold on, I think I see the problem.

06:17.900 --> 06:18.500
Ah!

06:18.500 --> 06:20.560
Are you okay jack?

06:20.560 --> 06:21.660
no I've cut myself

06:21.660 --> 06:22.689
should I call the

06:22.689 --> 06:23.980
medical assistance?

06:23.980 --> 06:26.420
No I'll get some
plasters from downstairs

06:26.429 --> 06:32.199
Do you know what Jim I've been thinking
in our family we used to have a

06:32.200 --> 06:39.260
tradition. Christmas Eve we always open
one present and you know what today is Jim

06:39.520 --> 06:41.060
it's Christmas Eve

06:41.060 --> 06:43.520
that's right Jim Bob

06:43.520 --> 06:45.680
I'm afraid I don't have a present for you Jack

06:45.880 --> 06:49.240
that's all right this is more of a

06:49.240 --> 06:51.700
reciprocal gift 33 beretta I'm ready

06:52.240 --> 06:52.960
Sub level 3

06:52.960 --> 06:54.260
Are you ready?

06:54.860 --> 06:55.800
I'm ready

06:59.500 --> 07:03.680
I'm afraid my sensors cannot determine
what that is

07:03.680 --> 07:04.979
it's an Ethernet cable and

07:04.980 --> 07:09.360
what it means is I can plug you into our
games console Hey

07:10.100 --> 07:14.540
Hey, do you reckon we should leave a note for Santa
upon the surface level you know just to

07:14.540 --> 07:16.040
let him know we're down there

07:16.040 --> 07:18.059
I'm not
sure what you mean

07:18.060 --> 07:20.560
do you require psychiatric help?

07:20.980 --> 07:23.840
hilarious Jim I see that humor upgrade

07:23.840 --> 07:25.140
it ain't been wasted

07:25.420 --> 07:25.980
knock knock

07:26.160 --> 07:27.040
who's there?

07:27.460 --> 07:28.180
madam

07:28.460 --> 07:29.180
Sub level 6

07:29.400 --> 07:30.120
Madam who?

07:30.520 --> 07:31.900
madam fingers are stuck in

07:32.100 --> 07:35.960
the door can you open it please
now that is humor

07:35.960 --> 07:38.369
no Jim that is sad and

07:38.369 --> 07:42.709
pathetic and who heard me tell it to Tony last week.

07:43.020 --> 07:43.520
Jim!

07:44.300 --> 07:45.940
What the hell's going on?

07:48.100 --> 07:51.360
was it an earthquake?

08:29.230 --> 08:31.040
Take me to the surface

08:31.040 --> 08:33.520
I'm afraid that
is impossible sub levels three to six

08:33.520 --> 08:34.720
have been compromised

08:34.720 --> 08:36.820
compromised what the hell do you mean compromised?

08:37.059 --> 08:41.260
Large amounts of radiation have been detected

08:43.580 --> 08:48.300
Oh I see. Hilarious, I bet Tony's put you up to this one, I bet you're all having a right laugh

08:48.300 --> 08:49.880
Jack I think you should look at

08:49.900 --> 08:51.620
the monitor on this floor

08:51.620 --> 08:56.220
okay I'll play along, open
the doors

09:03.990 --> 09:09.459
ground floor level 1 contaminated, sublevel
one contaminated

09:09.459 --> 09:12.580
Sub level 2 contaminated, where the hell's our smoke
coming from

09:12.580 --> 09:14.410
I'm not sure but the console

09:14.410 --> 09:17.040
should show you

09:18.280 --> 09:22.340
electrical fire in the audio suite

09:28.560 --> 09:30.600
[ coughing ]

09:31.600 --> 09:35.380
I think the fire's completely out Jim

09:38.830 --> 09:40.920
what's the damage Jim

09:40.920 --> 09:44.720
ground floor down
to sublevel six have large amounts of

09:44.720 --> 09:49.640
radiation enough to kill a human within
10 minutes by my estimation

09:49.640 --> 09:53.520
well at least the fires out what's the food
situation like?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.190
luckily for you jack this

09:55.190 --> 10:00.580
floor houses the entire food store
enough for the entire crew for 18 months

10:00.580 --> 10:03.900
well we should be alright for a few days
then

10:07.380 --> 10:09.160
what day we are now Jim

10:09.160 --> 10:09.760
Thursday

10:09.760 --> 10:16.670
well they'll be back Monday so I'll only be down here three days come on get the music on

10:16.670 --> 10:21.680
I'm afraid we don't have any music I cannot
access the mainframe what

10:21.680 --> 10:23.860
What?

10:23.860 --> 10:26.780
well pick us a film out to watch then make it something good

10:26.780 --> 10:29.880
we have no films

10:29.880 --> 10:31.120
well what about

10:31.130 --> 10:34.520
the old console games there still on the
server right?

10:34.520 --> 10:35.810
we have no access to the

10:35.810 --> 10:37.600
servers

10:37.600 --> 10:42.340
so we've got no entertainment at
all for three days?

10:46.260 --> 10:53.240
hey the CCTVs back up and running but there's still
no sign of anybody

10:57.600 --> 11:01.220
They should have been back by now Jim you detecting anything outside?

11:01.220 --> 11:03.260
nothing detected

11:22.680 --> 11:28.460
it's been two months
now I don't think anybody's coming back

11:28.460 --> 11:31.820
how long have we got to stay down here?

11:31.820 --> 11:34.110
the radiation levels will remain fatal

11:34.110 --> 11:36.860
for approximately eight years

11:36.860 --> 11:39.420
how long's the food gonna last?

11:39.420 --> 11:40.140
for an average male

11:40.140 --> 11:45.600
of your age the food should last eight
years and 13 days but at your current

11:45.600 --> 11:50.220
consumption rate it will only last five
years

11:51.560 --> 11:53.780
whatever

12:13.700 --> 12:14.200
Hey Jim

12:14.200 --> 12:15.680
Look what I've found here

12:21.160 --> 12:24.160
what is all this stuff?

12:24.160 --> 12:28.310
this facility was
opened in 1976 they are some of the

12:28.310 --> 12:33.220
belongings left behind by the staff over
the years

12:47.580 --> 12:52.260
give me some sugar baby

13:07.060 --> 13:08.360
Look what I've found.

13:12.300 --> 13:17.060
might be
a game let's get this bad boy set up

13:17.920 --> 13:21.580
it's bowling Jim now the name of the
game is you have to knock down all the

13:21.580 --> 13:25.580
pins here I'll go first and show you how
it's done

13:32.020 --> 13:33.120
but you will only knock down

13:33.120 --> 13:34.120
three pins

13:34.480 --> 13:38.000
I know Jim but you get
another go to knock down the rest

13:39.840 --> 13:40.840
yes

13:41.360 --> 13:48.240
your go Jim now take it side and try to
line it up in the middle

13:50.300 --> 13:54.220
beginner's luck come on let's have
another game

14:02.660 --> 14:04.080
we have a signal from the

14:04.089 --> 14:08.809
International Space Station it shows an
area unaffected by radiation

14:08.809 --> 14:10.120
What, no

14:10.120 --> 14:11.260
radiation at all?

14:11.920 --> 14:12.780
correct

14:14.060 --> 14:16.380
you know what
that means Jim this information could

14:16.380 --> 14:17.840
save the world

14:20.420 --> 14:24.720
no Jim
Schwarzenegger it was an action star you

14:24.720 --> 14:26.780
must have heard of him

14:34.940 --> 14:38.100
come on give me a
chance

14:48.940 --> 14:54.440
six and nine. 69

15:03.260 --> 15:06.240
a Royal Flush?

15:06.240 --> 15:07.620
wait a minute

15:07.620 --> 15:09.160
are you see in this monkey balls?

15:09.960 --> 15:11.240
He's been cheating

15:12.460 --> 15:15.860
we took you in off the
streets and we gave you a home and

15:15.870 --> 15:21.420
you're cheating on Christmas Day you
need to take a serious look at yourself

15:21.420 --> 15:22.440
horny

15:32.460 --> 15:36.200
you think I've heard you and
monkey balls talking about me and I

15:36.210 --> 15:41.610
wouldn't be surprised if Jim's in on it as
well well listen up I'm Captain Jack

15:41.610 --> 15:47.620
Chyser and this is my operation
you will not sabotage it all right

15:51.870 --> 15:54.700
Jack we have a radio signal coming through

15:54.700 --> 15:56.760
don't wind me up Jim

15:56.760 --> 15:58.160
seriously there is a

15:58.170 --> 16:00.720
radio signal

16:00.720 --> 16:02.400
so there's survivors?

16:02.700 --> 16:04.800
it's hard
to tell from the recording

16:04.960 --> 16:06.400
well let's hear it then

16:07.140 --> 16:11.600
[ distorted audio ]

16:12.240 --> 16:15.600
it then send it through to the audio
room

16:18.120 --> 16:19.440
patch it through Jim

16:20.580 --> 16:21.660
yeah I've got it

16:22.040 --> 16:24.680
right that's it and clean this up a
little bit

16:26.840 --> 16:33.900
[ distorted audio ]

16:34.240 --> 16:35.900
Somethings coming through

16:36.160 --> 16:37.200
Salvation...... [ unintelligible ] ...City

16:37.200 --> 16:38.440
Can you hear that Jim?

16:39.680 --> 16:43.960
salvation...governm...salvation City

16:50.400 --> 16:51.800
Salvation City

16:52.380 --> 16:54.060
Salvation City

16:56.120 --> 16:59.220
We've got a destination but we just don't know where

16:59.220 --> 17:03.920
it is
and we can't stay here much longer

17:07.800 --> 17:10.460
we need to start planning

17:32.660 --> 17:34.180
I hate punks worse than anything

17:58.180 --> 18:02.820
You better give up I'm a master and you're
going to lose this game

18:14.320 --> 18:15.520
This is the one Jim

18:31.800 --> 18:36.680
well we know we need to go south but we
don't know where the radiation is

18:36.680 --> 18:41.140
Well I can detect the radiation up to a 50-mile
radius of the base

18:41.440 --> 18:42.980
so that puts us here

18:43.320 --> 18:48.920
but there's still a long way to go this
is going to be a problem

19:09.060 --> 19:13.040
in your face Jim Bob

19:22.960 --> 19:25.080
oh you're the
meanest guy in the world

19:36.400 --> 19:38.020
Come on!

20:02.420 --> 20:05.880
can you hear me Jim I just have to take
you offline for a moment

20:05.880 --> 20:07.440
yes I can hear you Jack

20:07.980 --> 20:10.420
now open your eyes

20:10.420 --> 20:14.380
I don't
understand how do I open my eyes?

20:14.880 --> 20:18.760
there's a new program on your file system
execute it

20:22.420 --> 20:24.240
and that is not even the best

20:24.240 --> 20:27.460
bit move your wheels

20:31.220 --> 20:33.020
you didn't think I
was gonna leave you behind

20:33.039 --> 20:34.380
did you Jim?

20:34.380 --> 20:37.300
you just need me to come
along to detect the radiation

20:37.300 --> 20:38.169
yeah now

20:38.169 --> 20:40.000
come on we've got work to do

20:48.620 --> 20:59.160
food check, water check, tent check
devilish good looks

20:59.160 --> 21:01.520
check

21:01.520 --> 21:04.170
Ah Horny

21:04.260 --> 21:08.650
I'm not very good
these long goodbyes but you're the man

21:08.650 --> 21:12.160
of the house now
it's time for us to leave we don't know

21:12.160 --> 21:17.910
what's out there or if you can ever come
back goodbye my old friend

21:31.290 --> 21:32.920
which way South Jim?

21:32.920 --> 21:36.380
straight ahead jack

22:03.800 --> 22:07.060
we must be getting close how far have we
come?

22:07.420 --> 22:09.000
128 kilometres

22:09.280 --> 22:09.860
what's that in real

22:09.869 --> 22:14.036
money? it's a figure of speech Jim what
is it in miles?

22:14.036 --> 22:15.779
seventy nine point five

22:15.779 --> 22:19.080
three five five miles approximately

22:19.080 --> 22:20.909
I reckon we should reach civilization

22:20.909 --> 22:25.220
tomorrow well what's left of it

22:25.980 --> 22:28.420
do you ever have dreams Jim?

22:28.420 --> 22:29.340
I aspire to be as

22:29.340 --> 22:30.640
efficient as possible

22:31.460 --> 22:34.220
I don't mean that
kind of dream Jim I mean the kind you

22:34.229 --> 22:35.520
have when you sleep

22:35.520 --> 22:36.980
please explain

22:38.160 --> 22:41.540
it's like a vision a memory that plays in your

22:41.549 --> 22:43.860
head while you're asleep

22:43.860 --> 22:45.360
an involuntary
recall

22:47.100 --> 22:47.880
exactly

22:49.020 --> 22:49.900
what do you dream about

22:49.900 --> 22:50.700
jack

22:53.680 --> 22:57.980
doesn't matter we really need to
get you some better aspirations Jim

22:57.989 --> 23:04.169
because efficiency, It just ain't a
cool dream you were a robot now not just

23:04.169 --> 23:09.830
any run of the mill computer system
maybe we should find you a lady Robot

23:09.830 --> 23:13.460
I would very much like to interface with
another system

23:14.500 --> 23:16.679
now you talk in Jim go on

23:16.679 --> 23:18.840
what would you say to her?

23:18.840 --> 23:21.560
I would request access to their database

23:21.560 --> 23:22.799
yeah I

23:22.800 --> 23:25.520
think we need to work on your chat up
lines

23:35.660 --> 23:39.380
where the hell is everybody?

23:46.660 --> 23:52.120
dr. Stevens so they might actually go
out of here alive

23:53.240 --> 23:54.320
not everyone got out

23:54.320 --> 23:56.980
alive jack

24:12.080 --> 24:19.200
nothing much of use in there but at
least we know that the compasses working

24:19.200 --> 24:23.650
now we know the plane was heading to
London assuming it was taking a direct

24:23.650 --> 24:28.960
course that means were traveling due
South as planned how many miles are we

24:28.960 --> 24:29.860
traveled Jim?

24:29.860 --> 24:31.080
84 miles

24:31.080 --> 24:34.870
so that means
approximately 70 miles to the nearest

24:34.870 --> 24:39.600
town maybe that's where the survivors
are maybe that's where Claire is

24:40.440 --> 24:44.080
I'm sorry to tell you jack but it is
highly unlikely that anyone could have

24:44.080 --> 24:47.520
survived outside for any prolonged
period

24:47.520 --> 24:49.420
well you never know the area

24:49.420 --> 24:54.220
obviously wasn't affected that badly I
mean there's tons of vegetation

24:54.220 --> 24:59.800
don't let appearances fool you we may even see
fruit growing but don't eat it jack

24:59.800 --> 25:02.260
it will be contaminated and deadly for
humans

25:06.000 --> 25:07.980
come on Jim let's get a move on

25:07.990 --> 25:10.890
this place gives me the creeps

25:16.000 --> 25:18.320
Can you hear that Jim?

25:18.320 --> 25:20.260
sounds like a music

25:20.880 --> 25:23.640
It's coming from over there

25:35.320 --> 25:38.040
hello

26:23.740 --> 26:26.380
you see that Jim? It was a zombie.

26:26.680 --> 26:28.040
it wasn't a
zombie Jack

26:28.040 --> 26:29.920
It was a bloody zombie if it

26:29.920 --> 26:32.720
wern't for my kung-fu skills probably
eating me alive

26:33.500 --> 26:34.360
kung fu?

26:34.940 --> 26:36.620
yeah kung fu Jim

26:36.620 --> 26:38.800
I could see
through the door Jack she slipped and

26:38.809 --> 26:39.820
banged her head

26:39.820 --> 26:41.140
yeah but I pushed her

26:41.140 --> 26:42.710
oh well done jack you

26:42.710 --> 26:45.660
killed an infirm malnourished old lady

26:45.660 --> 26:48.280
grow up Jim

26:50.860 --> 26:51.580
Hello!

26:57.100 --> 27:03.160
hey where you heading I was worried there
wasn't any survivors or at least anyone

27:03.160 --> 27:07.780
that wasn't a zombie you're not a zombie
are you?

27:07.780 --> 27:09.120
what's that?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.100
that's Jim he's sort

27:11.110 --> 27:12.000
of a robot

27:12.000 --> 27:14.360
so where have you come from?

27:14.360 --> 27:15.250
about 60 miles

27:15.250 --> 27:16.960
north
we've been underground for the last

27:16.960 --> 27:18.020
eight years

27:18.020 --> 27:20.080
you've not been outside for
12 years Jack,

27:20.080 --> 27:20.710
let's not bore the man

27:20.710 --> 27:24.970
with the details we've heard a
broadcasts about salvation City is that

27:24.970 --> 27:28.060
where the survivors are how many
survived?

27:28.460 --> 27:29.410
You have any water?

27:29.800 --> 27:30.300
yeah of

27:30.420 --> 27:30.920
course

27:36.060 --> 27:38.300
Hey wait up

27:39.600 --> 27:42.740
So salvation city there is it far?

27:44.180 --> 27:48.240
no not too far I'm heading there myself

27:48.240 --> 27:51.040
welcome to tag along

27:51.040 --> 27:54.280
come on Jim

27:54.280 --> 27:55.530
there's no government at all?

27:55.530 --> 28:01.090
no it's all just kind of messed up
there's two main gangs there's the

28:01.090 --> 28:06.940
sylus gang in havenport they have the
water and there it's a Drayfus gang the

28:06.940 --> 28:09.800
Electric City they at the power plant

28:09.800 --> 28:12.140
well what about salvation city?

28:12.140 --> 28:12.880
you can see

28:12.880 --> 28:15.610
it for yourself
well almost there we've just got to

28:15.610 --> 28:19.460
make one quick stop first

28:32.760 --> 28:34.440
Who's this Slater?

28:34.700 --> 28:35.460
this

28:36.460 --> 28:39.920
this is Jack he's
got a bag full of food and water it's

28:39.920 --> 28:41.120
gonna give us

28:41.120 --> 28:42.500
you what?

28:42.940 --> 28:45.500
sorry jack
just business

28:49.000 --> 28:51.400
what we're gonna do now we

28:51.410 --> 28:55.450
got no map we've got no water

28:59.100 --> 29:03.400
all we got is this poxy sachet of ketchup

29:09.380 --> 29:13.820
it doesn't look like there's anybody
there are you picking anything up Jim

29:13.830 --> 29:16.790
nothing

29:18.260 --> 29:21.400
We're gonna have to take a look

29:24.870 --> 29:28.289
after you Jim

30:03.760 --> 30:10.440
Jack I'm in my kitchen, it looks like I
have found the farmer

30:28.730 --> 30:32.840
poor bastard he must have starved to death

30:32.840 --> 30:35.040
I have analyzed the fibers in the clothing

30:35.040 --> 30:39.840
this man died of prolonged exposure to
radiation around three years ago

30:41.080 --> 30:41.580
so if

30:41.580 --> 30:46.800
has been dead for three years that means
he survived out here for five years in

30:46.800 --> 30:49.760
the middle of nowhere
what the hell was he been living on

30:50.060 --> 30:53.125
I'm not sure but he was certainly not
farming

30:53.125 --> 30:55.100
Come on Jim let's take a look

30:55.100 --> 30:57.220
around

31:08.460 --> 31:13.980
yeah baby
hey up Jim cop a load of this

31:21.060 --> 31:21.960
Jackpot

31:36.100 --> 31:40.240
realistically Jim how many survivors do you think there is out there?

31:42.200 --> 31:43.820
I estimate a reduction of 98

31:43.820 --> 31:46.920
percent of the human population in the
past ten years

31:48.320 --> 31:50.440
the chances are nobody I

31:50.450 --> 31:55.240
knew is still alive

31:55.240 --> 31:58.580
did you have a family?

32:01.660 --> 32:04.600
I just need to get away for a while

32:04.600 --> 32:08.419
Is everything okay at home sorry I don't mean

32:08.420 --> 32:09.420
to pry

32:09.820 --> 32:14.220
that's okay something happened

32:15.260 --> 32:15.760
if you

32:15.769 --> 32:21.019
ever need to talk I'm here
no pressure but sometimes it's really

32:21.019 --> 32:26.690
good just to talk about these things
anytime you want to come see me at EKAF

32:26.690 --> 32:30.020
you do that that's what I'm there for

32:30.560 --> 32:34.120
Hostess, can I grab a whiskey

32:46.320 --> 32:53.460
there were so many people they came out
nowhere we got swamped. I tried to hold

32:53.470 --> 33:02.830
their hands but the current of the crowd
it was too strong my wife and son they

33:02.830 --> 33:04.880
were killed in the riots

33:07.640 --> 33:12.000
I did have a
family once upon a time

33:14.950 --> 33:18.760
looks like we're here Jim

33:36.340 --> 33:40.360
I don't think we're gonna find much here

34:44.659 --> 34:46.520
There's somebody out there

35:00.140 --> 35:03.140
what you doing?

35:08.940 --> 35:13.760
whoa I'm well-versed in the art of kung fu

35:14.740 --> 35:18.000
why didn't you use your kung fu Jack?

35:18.340 --> 35:19.800
Shut up Jim

35:52.800 --> 35:53.660
Stop

36:07.520 --> 36:09.920
I'll take these two

36:09.920 --> 36:11.640
My best two?

36:12.560 --> 36:16.060
Want me to get Sylus down here Ten Bolt?

36:37.120 --> 36:39.808
Claire

36:39.808 --> 36:41.600
jack

36:42.760 --> 36:45.800
I thought you was dead I've seen the plane
crash

36:45.800 --> 36:48.780
Jack listen Jack we havn't got much time

36:48.960 --> 36:52.340
you need to get a message
to salvation

37:12.040 --> 37:13.140
Jim

37:14.140 --> 37:16.220
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this one mate

37:16.220 --> 37:20.720
Luckily I made a few adjustments to my infrared

37:24.700 --> 37:25.240
let's

37:25.240 --> 37:27.900
get of here Jim

37:42.980 --> 37:45.520
oh hello sir table for one is it?

37:45.520 --> 37:46.740

want to ask you a couple of questions

37:46.740 --> 37:52.280
yeah there's a table over here sir would
you like a menu

37:52.440 --> 37:53.140

37:54.080 --> 37:57.380

38:04.690 --> 38:07.920

fresh

38:07.920 --> 38:09.100
I'll take the special then please

38:09.100 --> 38:11.280

that?

38:14.800 --> 38:18.700
a bit like the beer actually it's the
same drink but some people like to be

38:18.700 --> 38:20.760
offered a choice

38:20.760 --> 38:22.660
I'll take a beer then please

40:56.890 --> 40:59.823

the kitchen

pay so we're gonna take it back

41:05.830 --> 41:08.340

41:10.500 --> 41:13.140

41:17.980 --> 41:19.840
how the hell do we get out of here?

41:22.080 --> 41:23.100

I love this part

42:06.280 --> 42:09.500

42:13.440 --> 42:15.320
Oh for fuck's
sake

42:17.500 --> 42:18.520
Smiler

42:18.820 --> 42:22.880

42:30.420 --> 42:32.780
these two tried to escape from the cafe

42:32.780 --> 42:34.340

42:35.120 --> 42:36.440
Ten Bolt says this ones his

42:37.800 --> 42:38.840
He's mine

42:39.980 --> 42:44.300
He escaped for the slave docks and
Bernie says he owes him for meat

42:44.800 --> 42:45.460

42:45.470 --> 42:47.260

and who told you that stop pedaling?

43:01.130 --> 43:05.080
oh for Christ's sake

43:05.360 --> 43:10.350
there's more this one's been talking
about salvation says he has information that

43:10.350 --> 43:11.420
can save the world

43:11.420 --> 43:15.020
salvation? Drayfus sent you didn't he

43:15.020 --> 43:20.000
motherfucker well if he wants another
war you can have one

43:20.000 --> 43:21.480
I found this some

43:21.480 --> 43:23.220
kind of computer

43:23.220 --> 43:25.620
I don't know anybody
called Drayfus I'm looking for salvation

43:25.620 --> 43:29.400
city to deliver a message

43:29.400 --> 43:32.130
you'll deliver a message alright, you're gonna

43:32.130 --> 43:37.230
send a message to that bastard in
Electric City you tell him for me this

43:37.230 --> 43:41.850
is a breach of our agreement one more
incident and there will be consequences

43:41.850 --> 43:45.660
now take that thing down to the lab

43:45.660 --> 43:47.060
what
about this one

43:47.060 --> 43:49.880
get on the bike

43:49.880 --> 43:52.590
look I think there's
been a bit of a misunderstanding here

43:52.590 --> 43:54.760
get on the fucking bike

43:54.760 --> 43:57.200
I've only got
one leg

43:57.200 --> 43:59.430
okay fine take him back to the

43:59.430 --> 44:01.740
cafe and bring me back a burger

44:01.740 --> 44:05.240
no no wait

44:59.660 --> 45:04.410
you don't want one of those dirty skinpods, man like you deserves a nice cyber

45:04.410 --> 45:13.790
girl take one of these tell them Eddie sent
you. Ten percent discount

45:16.660 --> 45:23.040
I'm looking for some information I've
got these to trade

45:23.860 --> 45:25.339
we sell noodles here

45:25.339 --> 45:28.140
but the conversation is free

45:28.140 --> 45:30.720
I'm looking
for a place salvation city

45:30.720 --> 45:33.100
I can't say I've ever heard of such a place

45:33.100 --> 45:34.760
I think it's a place where there's scientists

45:34.760 --> 45:38.900
I really need to speak to them I have
some information that could save the

45:38.900 --> 45:39.720
world

45:40.180 --> 45:43.100
wow that's very dramatic

45:43.100 --> 45:47.260
talk like
that will get you killed in a hurry some

45:47.269 --> 45:52.549
people they don't want to be saved some
people just like things well just the

45:52.549 --> 45:53.718
way they are

45:53.718 --> 45:55.540
And you like living like
this?

45:55.540 --> 45:58.299
I didn't say that

45:58.450 --> 46:05.180
I'm serious I found evidence of a place
unaffected by radiation a place where

46:05.180 --> 46:09.511
we can start over we can grow crops we'll even have fresh air

46:09.840 --> 46:10.780
you just don't get

46:10.789 --> 46:18.740
it do you? okay let's just suppose you're
not another lunatic let's suppose this

46:18.740 --> 46:25.910
place exists they wouldn't let us have
it they'd take you for themselves it

46:25.910 --> 46:29.340
wasn't that long ago that you still had
hope Devon

46:29.340 --> 46:31.579
oh I still have hope some

46:31.579 --> 46:35.100
things have to change that's all

46:35.100 --> 46:37.759
salvation city must exist I heard it on

46:37.760 --> 46:39.420
a radio broadcast

46:39.420 --> 46:45.380
Ah, the radio salvation is not
City you're talking about project

46:45.380 --> 46:50.680
salvation it was a scheme that was brought
in to bring all the great minds together

46:50.680 --> 46:55.426
to build a brighter future it was here at
Electric City

46:55.426 --> 46:57.670
I'm afraid you're too late

46:57.670 --> 47:03.410
most of them were killed during the
revolution any that survived fled you

47:03.410 --> 47:07.519
might want to think twice before asking
around after them they are an outlawed

47:07.519 --> 47:11.000
group in Electric City

47:11.000 --> 47:12.289
so where did they all go?

47:12.289 --> 47:16.240
I'm sorry and really don't know

47:17.580 --> 47:19.720
do you know where this is?

47:20.500 --> 47:23.620
club Barbarella just go down the bottom of

47:23.620 --> 47:26.980
the street turn left and keep going

47:27.340 --> 47:28.320
Thanks

47:49.580 --> 47:51.320
what serving?

47:52.120 --> 47:55.260
credit or trade?

48:04.940 --> 48:08.300
what is it?

48:09.660 --> 48:10.540
Vodka

49:17.360 --> 49:21.000
that was brilliant

49:21.000 --> 49:23.060
I haven't seen you
around here before

49:23.060 --> 49:32.540
I'm from somewhere else but I do believe
we've got a mutual friend Claire Stevens

49:33.220 --> 49:37.520
okay
one more drink before work

49:38.240 --> 49:39.240
bartender two more of

49:39.240 --> 49:42.020
whatever that was

49:52.130 --> 49:54.380
how do you know Claire?

49:54.380 --> 49:57.030
I worked with her
at EKAF research but I've seen her

49:57.030 --> 50:01.380
more recently at Haven port now she told
me to find salvation and she drew me

50:01.380 --> 50:04.040
this symbol

50:05.260 --> 50:07.300
where is she now?

50:08.000 --> 50:10.320
I think they killed her

50:11.880 --> 50:14.600
she must have been a messenger the last

50:14.610 --> 50:21.830
messenger was executed I haven't heard
from salvation for three months now

50:26.360 --> 50:32.400
there have been rumors Drayfus has been
sending out search parties to find them

50:32.400 --> 50:38.790
not kill them but to bring them back to
electric city the generators in the city

50:38.790 --> 50:44.340
are failing and no one knows how to
repair them without them electric city

50:44.340 --> 50:49.440
will be finished

50:49.440 --> 50:53.430
Sylas and those beasts
from havenport would make light work of

50:53.430 --> 50:56.060
slaughtering us all.

50:56.060 --> 50:57.180
Who's Drayfus?

50:57.180 --> 50:59.930
you're really not from around here are you?

50:59.930 --> 51:03.280
Drayfus is the boss of electric city

51:03.280 --> 51:05.960
and
you think he knows where to find them?

51:05.960 --> 51:10.710
maybe but no one sees Drayfus without
being invited

51:10.710 --> 51:12.560
what can I find him?

51:12.560 --> 51:13.740
you get killed

51:14.200 --> 51:16.040
that's my concern

51:16.040 --> 51:18.420
Santa's grotto

51:18.420 --> 51:19.880
just tell me

51:19.880 --> 51:23.240

53:52.840 --> 53:56.150
oK you've won so you get to ask your
question

53:56.150 --> 53:58.880
I need to know where salvation is

53:58.880 --> 54:00.830
I'll
draw you a map, it's the other side of

54:00.830 --> 54:06.190
radiation lake but you're gonna need
this

54:09.650 --> 54:14.990
I'm gonna need one more thing I need to
pay an old friend a visit I'm gonna need

54:14.990 --> 54:18.100
some firepower

54:18.100 --> 54:19.380
in havenport?

54:19.380 --> 54:22.749
yeah
havenport

54:37.940 --> 54:39.940
ah

54:47.800 --> 54:50.500
Come on

54:51.340 --> 54:52.060
Stand back

54:56.120 --> 54:59.380
Jim can you hear me

54:59.380 --> 55:01.800
I can hear you
jack

55:01.800 --> 55:07.430
What the hell have they done to you? come on let's get you out of here

55:08.480 --> 55:13.580
the salvation boys back causing havoc, he's killed Bernie and the butcher

55:13.580 --> 55:14.440
what

55:14.440 --> 55:17.660
and he's released the slaves

56:17.620 --> 56:23.720
I think we've lost them don't worry Jim
we'll get you all fixed up we just need to find

56:23.720 --> 56:24.920
salvation

56:24.920 --> 56:28.400
well the good news is that I
still have the information they took my

56:28.400 --> 56:32.900
hard drive but I made a backup in my ram
the bad news is that my battery is dying

56:32.900 --> 56:36.230
as soon as it does the information will
be lost forever

56:36.230 --> 56:40.680
We'll soon be coming up on radiation lake

56:47.580 --> 56:52.040
Jack radiation levels are rising

57:00.420 --> 57:05.160
I estimate that you will only have three
hours to reach the other side

57:05.170 --> 57:08.130
let's do this

57:24.280 --> 57:27.630
battery at 3%

57:38.400 --> 57:42.719
radiation levels are still rising

57:53.930 --> 58:00.520
you cannot sustain this dosage for much
longer Jack maybe we should turn back

58:12.760 --> 58:16.330
battery at 1%

58:24.780 --> 58:29.160
radiation levels are dangerously high

59:14.200 --> 59:15.660
Sir, I think he's coming round

59:17.500 --> 59:21.000
ah nice of you
to join us Mr Chyser

59:21.010 --> 59:25.690
so tell me this do you still want to
save the world

59:25.690 --> 59:28.620
don't I know you from somewhere

59:29.660 --> 59:33.380
welcome
to salvation
