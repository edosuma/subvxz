WEBVTT

00:21.021 --> 00:24.158
Let me be clear.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.528
To truly grasp
man's struggle for power...

00:27.561 --> 00:30.731
we must begin
in the prehistoric sea...

00:30.765 --> 00:33.300
that dark and merciless void.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.804
It was eons
before the strongest among us

00:37.037 --> 00:39.306
slithered out of the muck
to discover

00:39.340 --> 00:42.243
that the lessons of darkness
would continue on land.

00:43.411 --> 00:46.414
Futility. Toil.

00:46.447 --> 00:50.518
The mass of men spend
their days plowing stones.

00:50.551 --> 00:55.322
But true immortality rests
in a pure and mighty will...

00:55.356 --> 00:59.059
for history isn't written
by the feeble masses,

00:59.093 --> 01:00.795
the pissants...

01:00.828 --> 01:05.099
commies, the queers,
and the women.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.301
It is written and rewritten

01:07.334 --> 01:10.070
by soldiers carrying
the banner of kings.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.341
That is what it means
to be strong.

01:16.710 --> 01:19.680
That is what it means
to be American.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.185
That is what it means...

01:25.553 --> 01:27.154
...to be Nixon.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.638
<i>You know her as
one of the most outspoken</i>

01:44.672 --> 01:46.841
<i>conservatives in Washington.</i>

01:46.874 --> 01:48.809
<i>You've seen her
on</i> Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In

01:48.843 --> 01:50.611
<i>and</i> The Dinah Shore Show.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.213
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:52.246 --> 01:53.714
the wife
of the Attorney General

01:53.747 --> 01:55.316
of the United States,

01:55.349 --> 01:57.685
the infamous
Mouth of the South,

01:57.718 --> 01:59.220
Martha Mitchell.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.499
Well, welcome, Mrs. Mitchell.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.467
I hope you are ready
to tell the whole truth

02:13.501 --> 02:14.835
and nothing but the truth.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.537
Well, if you're gonna put me
on the stand,

02:16.570 --> 02:17.805
I better have
my lawyer present.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.542
Now, Martha,

02:21.575 --> 02:23.477
I have heard the rumor
that your husband was made

02:23.511 --> 02:26.380
the director of the Committee
to Re-elect the President.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.883
Yes.
And I am the secret weapon.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.851
I bet you are.

02:30.885 --> 02:32.553
Fuck, she is cheesy.

02:32.586 --> 02:36.690
Martha Mitchell all dressed up
like a holiday ham.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.759
Nice smile, though.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.160
<i>I can dig on that smile.</i>

02:40.194 --> 02:41.428
And a orangutan.

02:41.462 --> 02:44.398
She's an idiot and a lush.

02:44.431 --> 02:46.667
Why are you leaving
all of a sudden?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.336
Stay.
We can watch some <i>Password.</i>

02:49.370 --> 02:51.872
- Oh, yeah?
- Do the thing...

02:51.906 --> 02:53.707
- again.
- That sounds nice.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.543
But my boss
doesn't exactly understand

02:55.576 --> 03:00.314
the, uh, finer points
of the long lunch.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.449
Oh, yeah? Who's your boss?

03:02.483 --> 03:03.584
Mm.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.453
That is on
a need-to-know basis.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.190
Well, thank you.
It's fascinating.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.760
Oh, hold up.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.595
You work for Nixon?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.897
Oh, you're big-time.
You know, I knew it.

03:16.931 --> 03:19.600
The second I saw this place,
I thought to myself, "Wow.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.535
This guy right here,
he's big-time-plus."

03:21.569 --> 03:22.870
Well, you're the expert.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.939
- Who's your superior?
- What?

03:24.972 --> 03:27.341
Who do you report to
at the White House?

03:27.374 --> 03:30.244
Haldeman? Ehrlichman? Hess?

03:30.277 --> 03:34.982
Colson? Atwater? Buchanan?
Chapin? Fleming?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.317
You know a lot of people.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.586
Honey, it's my job
to network...

03:38.619 --> 03:40.287
among other jobs.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.755
At least you're at the Oval.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.858
You could be stuck with those
headless turkeys over at CREEP.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.427
CREEP's the Committee
to Re-elect--

03:46.460 --> 03:48.329
The President.
I know what CREEP stands for.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.698
I actually spend
quite a lot of time over there.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.366
- Yeah.
- Ah.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.634
I used to work for the guy
who was gonna be

03:53.667 --> 03:54.868
<i>Nixon's new campaign chair.</i>

03:54.902 --> 03:57.404
John-boy? Oh, my God!

03:57.438 --> 03:59.473
You tell him Francesca says hi.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.542
You know John Mitchell too?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.410
<i>Sure I do.
He's a dear friend.</i>

04:03.444 --> 04:05.312
Hope he's keeping up
with all that spring cleaning

04:05.346 --> 04:07.514
- over there.
- Wait.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.682
Spring clean--You--

04:11.619 --> 04:13.754
You think h-h-he--
Is he pushing people out?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.656
I didn't say that.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.391
I didn't not say it either.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.627
<i>♪...for you and me ♪</i>

04:35.943 --> 04:37.678

Who the fuck is
Martha talking to

06:09.970 --> 06:12.139
at two o'clock in the morning
in Los Angeles?

06:12.372 --> 06:13.974
Uh, Lloyd Shearer at <i>Parade.</i>
That would be my guess.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.843
He's a known
subversive leftist.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.044
Cocksucker.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.445
Not sure about that, sir,

06:18.479 --> 06:20.380
but I can pull up
his file if you'd like.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.118
I was explicit with her.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.754
No solo interviews
this close to the election.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.092
Any luck tracking down my wife?

06:32.126 --> 06:34.962
<i>She hasn't returned
from her taping yet, sir.</i>

06:34.995 --> 06:36.964
<i>But I have John Dean
here for you.</i>

06:36.997 --> 06:40.634
Oh, God.
Yeah, send the fucker in.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.839
Dean, you flaxen-haired dog.
How you doing, buddy?

06:45.873 --> 06:47.407
- Yeah, good to see you.
- You take a seat.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.576
- Sir.
- Dean.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.411
You look well.

06:51.445 --> 06:55.916
So, uh, I was told you wanted
to see me about something.

06:55.949 --> 06:56.884
Oh, yes.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.186
Uh, as you know, we're gearing
up for what promises to be

06:59.419 --> 07:00.754
a grueling reelection campaign.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.991
And as such,
we are currently reevaluating

07:04.024 --> 07:07.494
certain select personnel.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.062
"Reevaluating"?

07:09.096 --> 07:11.131
Yeah, that's right.
Hey, tell me something.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.100
Where do you see
yourself in a year?

07:13.133 --> 07:14.835
Where do--in a...

07:14.868 --> 07:17.604
Hmm, that's a-
That's a great question.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.740
Um...

07:19.773 --> 07:21.975
Well, let me start by saying,

07:22.009 --> 07:23.577
I have very much valued
the opportunity

07:23.610 --> 07:25.078
to help implement
the president's vision.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.581
And I would urge you
to remember my loyalty

07:27.614 --> 07:29.550
when considering
my continued service

07:29.583 --> 07:32.219
in whatever capacity
that service might be needed,

07:32.452 --> 07:35.189
uh, going forward

07:35.222 --> 07:37.758
forthwith...

07:37.791 --> 07:39.626
in the future.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.863
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.865
I think he thinks this is

07:44.898 --> 07:48.001
some kind of spring-cleaning
situation, sir.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.003
Wait, what?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.939
So you're not recommending
that I be fired?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.073
No. Gosh, no! No.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.942
We brought you in here
because we've uh--

07:54.975 --> 07:57.477
we got a kind
of special opportunity for you.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.979
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.781
Wow. Okay. Um...

08:00.814 --> 08:02.583
I assume you're aware
of the Intelligence Unit

08:02.616 --> 08:03.851
that was set up in the Oval

08:03.884 --> 08:05.519
after this whole
Pentagon Papers fiasco?

08:05.552 --> 08:06.787
Right. The Plumbers.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.055
<i>Yeah,
that's- that's right.</i>

08:08.088 --> 08:10.958
<i>Uh, there's a CIA reject
named Howard Hunt.</i>

08:10.991 --> 08:12.626
<i>He's the main guy over there.</i>

08:12.659 --> 08:14.761
<i>And they're currently graduating</i>

08:14.795 --> 08:19.066
from rooting out leaks to, uh,
rat-fucking the Democrats.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.869
<i>And there is a desire</i>

08:21.902 --> 08:25.606
to enact a uh, similar operation

08:25.639 --> 08:28.075
on the campaign side of things.

08:29.743 --> 08:32.512
You mean you want to set up
an espionage unit...

08:32.546 --> 08:34.848
here, inside
the Committee to Re-elect

08:34.882 --> 08:36.283
to spy on the Democrats?

08:36.516 --> 08:38.051
- <i>Oh, heavens, no, no.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

08:38.085 --> 08:39.620
Espionage? That's a--that's--

08:39.653 --> 08:41.121
that's a big--
that's a serious word.

08:41.154 --> 08:44.524
No, we're talking about
simple intelligence gathering.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.095
I see. Um...

08:48.128 --> 08:50.564
Nixon has 19 points
on the Dems.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.065
The election is practically
in the bag.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.868
Why would we risk
that kind of legal exposure?

08:54.902 --> 08:56.603
<i>It's not our job to ask why.</i>

08:56.637 --> 09:00.007
If men like us asked why,
we wouldn't have the pyramids.

09:00.040 --> 09:04.978
Swollen wet vaginas.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.316
We are good men.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.184
We are men of integrity.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.819
But we come

09:12.853 --> 09:17.057
from our mothers'
swollen wet vaginas

09:17.090 --> 09:19.159
with flaws.

09:19.192 --> 09:23.030
And a time comes where we need
to employ those flaws

09:23.063 --> 09:25.132
to defeat our enemy.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.168
We must become snakes.

09:33.941 --> 09:36.977
I see, uh...

09:37.010 --> 09:38.245
Well, look...

09:40.747 --> 09:44.985
...I'm not sure
that it would be prudent for me

09:45.018 --> 09:48.956
to pursue any...

09:48.989 --> 09:52.793
snake behavior for you...

09:52.826 --> 09:56.229
at this specific point in time.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.666
Hmm.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.069
Shit.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.338
Well, I'll tell the president.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.239
Sorry, the--the president?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.275
Who the fuck do you think
asked for you?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.810
President Nixon asked for me?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.011
Well, to be clear,

10:11.044 --> 10:12.713
the president
would never involve himself

10:12.746 --> 10:14.014
in anything illegal, but, yes.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.315
<i>It's a damn shame.</i>

10:15.349 --> 10:18.051
We thought maybe
you were one of us, but...

10:18.085 --> 10:19.186
you can go.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.725
Diana, get Bob Haldeman for me.

10:24.758 --> 10:29.363
I think I may potentially know
how to charm the snake.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.164
- I think I know a guy.
- You know a guy?

10:31.198 --> 10:32.366
- I know a guy.
- Oh.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.635
Bud Krogh's guy,
Gordon... something.

10:35.669 --> 10:36.937
H-h-he'd be perfect

10:36.970 --> 10:39.206
for an intelligence-gathering
operation of this scope.

10:39.239 --> 10:42.676
He's high logistical savvy,
genius-level IQ, Mensa type.

10:42.709 --> 10:45.145
- Sounds like our type.
- Liddy. Gordon Liddy.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.381
<i>That's his name,
uh, Gordon Liddy.</i>

10:47.414 --> 10:49.383
If you were to hire him,

10:49.416 --> 10:52.919
say, as a general counsel...

10:54.254 --> 10:56.423
...I could get him settled in.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.258
Show him the ropes.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.995
And I could answer any...

11:02.029 --> 11:06.400
election-compliance questions
that he might have.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.106
He's good, isn't he?
Didn't I say he's good?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.075
<i>Mr. Mitchell?</i>

11:15.108 --> 11:16.710
<i>I have your wife on the phone.</i>

11:16.743 --> 11:18.211
<i>She says she's about to go
into a magazine interview.</i>

11:18.245 --> 11:19.880
Sick--Okay, get the fuck out.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.048
<i>What the two
of you still doing here?</i>

11:21.081 --> 11:22.282
- Yes, sir..
- Go. Go, go.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.318
Uh, thank you. Thank you, sir.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.154
Martha marshmallow.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.289
What's this I hear
about an interview?

11:29.322 --> 11:31.024
Hey, Dean, Dean!

11:31.058 --> 11:32.259
Hold on. One more thing.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.062
We're gonna want, um,
your, uh, Liddy friend

11:35.095 --> 11:37.464
to wrangle up a little
presentation for the group,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.266
just a run-through
of potential...

11:39.299 --> 11:41.134
<i>Martha,
you are not listening...</i>

11:41.168 --> 11:43.737
...intelligence gathering,
you- you know,

11:43.770 --> 11:45.972
- Espionage targets.
- Right.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.340
So, uh, next Thursday morning?
Is that okay?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.742
Next Thursday?

11:48.775 --> 11:50.110
It's a little tight,
I know, but Mitchell,

11:50.143 --> 11:54.081
he's stretched so thin
with the, you know, wife.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.415
I've told you,
no solo interviews

11:55.449 --> 11:57.984
that haven't gone
through the campaign.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.720
<i>- M-Martha, what did I tell you?</i>
- So Thursday?

12:00.754 --> 12:02.489
Hmm, yeah. Oh, absolutely.
No problem.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.925
Terrific. Terrific, Deano!
Fabulous.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.493
Martha?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.828
Martha!

12:09.830 --> 12:12.132
Right there.

12:14.134 --> 12:15.735
Oh, why, thank you, dear.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.904
And could you please
get a martini for Ms. McLendon?

12:17.938 --> 12:19.306
Oh, no. No, thank you.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.074
I-I don't usually drink
with my interview subjects.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.276
Mr. McCord here, he doesn't
drink on the job either.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.846
I don't trust him one bit.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.814
Uh, with a twist.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.316
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.817
Now, where were we?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.119
Uh, well, I was ask--

12:32.152 --> 12:35.522
Oh, have I shown you my vases?
They're Chinese.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.191
Yes. Uh, I was asking
if there's any truth

12:38.225 --> 12:40.193
to the talk that
your ease with the press

12:40.227 --> 12:42.195
has soured your relationship
with the president.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.763
A vicious rumor.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.800
I am the one who introduced
Dick to my husband.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.369
So there's no concern that
you're overshadowing Nixon?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.872
You make me sound
like an old oak tree.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.407
Would you ask such
a question to Kissinger?

12:54.441 --> 12:55.842
With all due respect,

12:55.876 --> 12:58.211
Kissinger doesn't have
a 76% name recognition

12:58.245 --> 12:59.446
with American families--you do.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.548
Well, someone should tell that
to Pat Nixon.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.918
She has been double-booking
our events to make a point.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.420
Just this week, I had
to reschedule a fundraiser

13:07.454 --> 13:10.957
just to satisfy her lust
for the spotlight.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.792
Right on.

13:12.826 --> 13:16.396
Let's get the vase in
the frame now and the portrait.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.134
This won't be the first time

13:21.168 --> 13:22.936
I've had to be glamorous
under my husband.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.173
Uh, Mrs. Mitchell,
just because I write

13:26.206 --> 13:27.507
for the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>
doesn't mean

13:27.541 --> 13:29.409
that this isn't
a real interview.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.479
A couple months ago,
you spoke out against the war.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.881
And I'm wondering
if your husband

13:34.915 --> 13:36.149
or the president has--

13:36.183 --> 13:38.585
Oh, you spoil me.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.087
Look at that. Thank you.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.189
There you are.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.491
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.361
Winnie...
May I call you Winnie?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.397
- Sure.
- <i>You want to know why</i>

13:50.430 --> 13:52.532
<i>I've made these comments
against the war?</i>

13:52.566 --> 13:54.935
Well, it's because
my own boy, Jay,

13:54.968 --> 13:56.903
is over there
in that godforsaken jungle

13:56.937 --> 13:58.471
fighting for his life
as we speak,

13:58.505 --> 14:01.308
surrounded by men
who are trying to kill him.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.510
<i>Do you know what that's like?</i>

14:03.543 --> 14:07.414
Just constantly worried
that he might not make it home?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.119
Oh, dear.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.387
Who is it for you?

14:14.421 --> 14:17.524
My little brother. He's...

14:17.557 --> 14:20.126
I see.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.262
We are empathetic creatures.

14:22.295 --> 14:23.396
Yes.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.966
Now, some people see that
as a weakness.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.402
But I decided long ago
that I will say how I feel.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.004
And if that does not conform

14:31.037 --> 14:32.472
to the president's message,
so be it.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.474
If that gets me
banned off <i>Air Force One,</i>

14:34.507 --> 14:36.409
I will fly commercial.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.550
So you were banned
from <i>Air Force One?</i>

14:43.583 --> 14:47.220
- Oh, you're good.
- I do want to hear that story.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.455
You caught that.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.123
We can get back
to the real questions, but--

14:51.491 --> 14:52.492
<i>Where are you?</i>

14:52.525 --> 14:54.594
We're in the sitting room,
cupcake. Put that away.

14:54.628 --> 14:56.896
McCord! Where's McCord?

14:56.930 --> 14:58.365
Yes, sir.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.967
Would you kindly escort
these people

15:01.001 --> 15:02.936
the fuck out of my home?

15:02.969 --> 15:03.970
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>

15:04.004 --> 15:05.305
That's okay.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.573
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for coming.

15:06.606 --> 15:07.907
- Thank you.
- Sorry about this.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.376
<i>No, thank you so much.</i>

15:17.984 --> 15:19.286
Have you gone insane?

15:19.319 --> 15:22.022
I told you,
no more print interviews.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.057
Oh, it's a ladies' magazine.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.226
They were asking me about
the curtains, for Christ's sake.

15:26.259 --> 15:28.061
<i>Oh, I know
exactly what you're doing.</i>

15:28.094 --> 15:30.297
You're just trying to take
the spotlight from Pat Nixon.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.232
I would never. Let me do this.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.001
Do--do you really think
that she, in a million years,

15:35.035 --> 15:36.269
would plan her concert

15:36.303 --> 15:38.104
just to be on the same night
as your party?

15:38.138 --> 15:39.639
It's a fundraiser,

15:39.673 --> 15:42.342
for her husband's campaign,
by the way.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.644
And, yes, I think
she absolutely meant to do it.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.446
Oh, it's a misunderstanding.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.682
The Bay of Pigs
was a misunderstanding.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.183
This is an encroachment.

15:50.216 --> 15:53.186
Oh, for fuck's sake.

15:53.219 --> 15:56.489
I had to reorganize everything.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.225
The caterer, the flowers,

15:59.259 --> 16:01.361
all because you don't know
how to stand up

16:01.394 --> 16:03.263
to your boss' wife.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.367
At least Pat Nixon knows
how to support her husband.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.537
That's not what I heard.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.405
Maybe if she stopped
talking behind my back,

16:12.439 --> 16:16.609
she might find a more fruitful
use for that mouth of hers.

16:18.712 --> 16:21.748
Are you implying
that the first lady

16:21.981 --> 16:25.185
isn't blowing
her husband enough?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.252
What?

16:26.286 --> 16:28.488
No! You're disgusting.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.522
Oh.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.624
She wouldn't know
where to start.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.761
But I do.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.565
I know right where to sta--

16:38.598 --> 16:40.667
Okay, stop it. Stop it.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.035
Don't I?

16:42.068 --> 16:43.670
Stop it, Martha.
I'm really angry this time.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.738
Oh, all right.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.409
I'm sorry.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.782
How can I make it up to you?

17:05.358 --> 17:08.094
That'll be enough.
You can stand down.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.496
Yes, sir.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.041
Mm.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.309
I thought he'd never leave.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.648
- Welcome home.
- Mm.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.762
He should be done with his call
any moment now, Mr. Liddy.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.764
Are you sure
you don't need anything?

17:44.798 --> 17:46.499
No, thank you.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.236
What's your name?

17:50.270 --> 17:52.338
Uh, Linda.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.076
Gordon. I'm
so sorry to keep you waiting.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.245
Great to meet you.
Finally put a face to the name.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.548
You ready? Let's walk.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.187
These pitches
always wind me up.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.855
You nervous?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.524
Oh, I don't experience
human neuroses.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.795
I actually feed
off these moments.

18:15.829 --> 18:20.400
There's a wild and manic energy
to them, animal energy.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.369
Hmm.

18:25.472 --> 18:29.609
Ouch.
What happened there?

18:29.642 --> 18:33.680
I was sourcing
operational recruits...

18:33.713 --> 18:36.149
Cubans.

18:36.182 --> 18:40.687
I needed to show them that I am
what the Spanish call <i>macho.</i>

18:40.720 --> 18:44.524
So I placed my hand into the--

18:44.557 --> 18:46.860
the short flame of a candle
and held it there

18:46.893 --> 18:49.429
until the room smelled
of roasting flesh.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.567
Only then were they willing
to call me their <i>jefe.</i>

18:58.905 --> 19:00.874
<i>Gentlemen, as you know,</i>

19:00.907 --> 19:04.310
<i>our president faces
a daunting campaign season.</i>

19:04.344 --> 19:08.381
For that reason, I've devised
a plan for covert operations,

19:08.414 --> 19:10.250
the likes of which
our electoral system

19:10.283 --> 19:11.584
has never seen.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.587
I present you...

19:17.290 --> 19:19.359
...Operation Gemstone.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.529
<i>The Gemstone,</i>

19:22.562 --> 19:25.732
brilliant, sparkling...

19:25.765 --> 19:27.934
impervious.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.570
I have crafted
an integrated strategy

19:30.603 --> 19:34.741
meant to function seamlessly
in enemy <i>territoire.</i>

19:34.774 --> 19:37.744
Phase one...

19:37.777 --> 19:39.445
Operation Quartz.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.881
<i>- A covert manipulation--</i>
- Oh, quartz--

19:41.915 --> 19:44.684
uh, quartz
is actually a mineral.

19:44.717 --> 19:45.752
Excuse me?

19:45.785 --> 19:47.387
Uh, quartz is actually
a mineral.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.521
It's not a gemsto--

19:48.555 --> 19:51.558
I took a little geology
at, uh, Williams,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.259
which I briefly attended.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.462
But I-I just love rocks.
Please proceed.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.933
Operation Quartz...

19:59.966 --> 20:02.235
a covert manipulation

20:02.268 --> 20:04.270
of the Democrats' outer circle.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.607
<i>We will round up
their fringe activist leaders</i>

20:07.640 --> 20:12.478
and export them to black sites
deep in the heart of Mexico.

20:12.512 --> 20:16.849
Each capture will slice
a viper from Medusa's crown.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.920
<i>Their leaderless ranks
will wither away.</i>

20:20.954 --> 20:24.624
Is that "export" as in kidnap?

20:24.657 --> 20:28.328
"Forced rendition"
is the optimal descriptor.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.363
<i>Next up...</i>

20:30.396 --> 20:32.599
<i>...Operation Ruby--</i>

20:32.632 --> 20:35.902
<i>the blood-red gem
of a duplicitous woman.</i>

20:35.935 --> 20:40.340
The Democrats are weak,
their women cold.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.009
We will secure a pleasure craft

20:43.242 --> 20:45.244
wired for sight and sound

20:45.278 --> 20:47.880
<i>and sailed to the Democratic
National Convention,</i>

20:47.914 --> 20:50.350
<i>where we will capture
their officials</i>

20:50.383 --> 20:54.287
enjoying the company of women
trained in the erotic arts,

20:54.320 --> 20:56.756
some of the finest
in the country.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.927
You want to film...

21:00.960 --> 21:04.330
Democratic officials...

21:04.364 --> 21:07.567
on a boat with hookers?

21:09.035 --> 21:13.473
Call it a passion play
for opposition leverage, sir.

21:13.506 --> 21:16.743
Just out of curiosity,
how many of these gemstones

21:16.776 --> 21:18.778
are we going to be
reviewing today?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.680
Eleven. With four subparts.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.316
And, uh, how much is this
all gonna cost?

21:23.349 --> 21:24.517
We're looking at a price point

21:24.550 --> 21:26.819
between $50,000
and $100,000 apiece.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.488
Right. Just finger math--

21:28.521 --> 21:32.392
that's uh, way over budget, sir,
astonishingly so.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.060
And that will not be a problem,
young man.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.828
Oh, good.

21:35.862 --> 21:37.563
<i>I do hope you
gentlemen have had a chance</i>

21:37.597 --> 21:38.931
<i>to brush up
on your II Corinthians,</i>

21:38.965 --> 21:42.535
because, well...

21:42.568 --> 21:44.804
this is
where we get to play God.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.908
My pitches are too ambitious?

21:51.544 --> 21:55.548
Who in the fresh hell
does Mitchell think he is?

21:55.581 --> 21:59.419
You see the way he looked at me
when all was said and done?

21:59.452 --> 22:00.687
Uh, no.
I didn't catch that.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.321
I'll tell you,
like a rat at his feet.

22:02.355 --> 22:05.925
It was like vomit.
That's how he looked at me.

22:05.958 --> 22:09.562
You know, t-those guys can be
very indelicate, uh, sometimes.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.631
<i>I wouldn't take it
too- too personally.</i>

22:11.664 --> 22:14.600
And Magruder--
that little pissant...

22:16.002 --> 22:19.072
..."Quartz is a mineral."

22:19.105 --> 22:20.707
He's lucky
I didn't snap his spine

22:20.740 --> 22:22.375
right in the fucking room.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.080
<i>Um...</i>

22:31.784 --> 22:33.019
What did you think?

22:33.052 --> 22:34.454
What?

22:34.487 --> 22:36.089
Of the pitch,
what did you think?

22:36.122 --> 22:39.459
You can tell me.
I'm--I can take it.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.931
What did I think?
I-I-I-I-I really liked it.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.767
I-I knew it!

22:47.800 --> 22:50.103
I saw your body language
in the room, and I knew--

22:50.136 --> 22:51.437
I knew Dean liked it.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.872
What was your favorite part?

22:52.905 --> 22:54.407
<i>My favorite?</i>

22:54.440 --> 22:57.677
Um, gosh, you know, th--
t-there were a lot of elements.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.878
<i>You know, I loved the--</i>

22:58.911 --> 23:01.013
T-the cheerful font
was very interesting.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.482
I did the font.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.117
- Great, uh...
- I came up with the font.

23:04.150 --> 23:07.153
Yeah, look, let me
pitch you something.

23:10.990 --> 23:15.595
How about you and I never talk
about this ever again,

23:15.628 --> 23:16.829
ideally?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.971
Okay, compadre.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.506
Enough said.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.778
I do. I really like this one.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.980
I think that's nice, dear.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.996
Whenever he has on tails,
this happens.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.698
It does. Whenever you put on
your tails...

23:52.732 --> 23:54.934
...it makes you crazy.

23:54.967 --> 23:59.172

Yes, ma'am. Think we can

24:16.522 --> 24:17.990
Shimmy it up.

24:18.024 --> 24:20.660
Ooh.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.129
There it is. Look at that neck.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.864
There's a tiny little hook.

24:24.897 --> 24:27.033
Now, that's a neck. That's...

24:27.066 --> 24:29.035
that's a neck I'd like to neck.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.739
I can't get that...

24:35.975 --> 24:37.543

President Nixon,

25:48.314 --> 25:50.249
stop bombing human beings,

25:50.283 --> 25:52.585
animals, and vegetation.

25:52.618 --> 25:53.953
You go to church on Sundays,

25:53.986 --> 25:55.288
and you pray to Jesus Christ.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.123
If Jesus Christ
were here tonight,

25:57.156 --> 25:59.725
<i>you would not dare

25:59.759 --> 26:02.862
Bless the Berrigans
and bless Daniel Ellsberg.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.664
Get her off the stage!

26:15.341 --> 26:17.143
<i>Sorry about that,
Mr. President.</i>

26:17.176 --> 26:19.979
Looks like someone needs to go
back to finishing school.

26:20.012 --> 26:22.882
<i>- Let's move along, shall we?</i>

26:22.915 --> 26:23.916
<i>Ladies...</i>

26:32.224 --> 26:33.326
Maureen?

26:33.359 --> 26:34.794
Hey, John Dean.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.796
- Hi.
- Hi. I am so sorry I'm late.

26:36.829 --> 26:37.930
That's fine.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.231
It's not
some first-date power move.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.866
You know, things have been
nuts at work...

26:40.900 --> 26:42.969
- You know what? It's Mo.
- Traffic and--what?

26:43.002 --> 26:44.337
You can just call me Mo.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.939
Uh, the dating service
suggested that I use Maureen...

26:46.973 --> 26:48.174
Oh, Mo...

26:48.207 --> 26:49.308
...'cause I guess they
thought people would make...

26:49.342 --> 26:50.643
- Like the Stooges?
- ...a Stooges joke.

26:50.676 --> 26:51.911
What? Oh.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.279
So sorry.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.614
You're doing the Stooges--
I didn't--No, I-I remember.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.051
- Good.
- Yes.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.687
- Stooges.
- Um, so--

27:01.721 --> 27:04.690
Hi, hello. How are you know?
Now, I'm gonna give you these.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.926
It's for the, uh, Dijon Porsche
out front.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.694
Now, there's not a scratch
on it right now.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.363
And that's how I want to find
her when I come back, okay?

27:10.396 --> 27:12.198
I'm gonna take
special care of you, okay?

27:12.231 --> 27:14.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you so much.

27:14.367 --> 27:15.868
Your table's ready.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.371
All right. Thank you.

27:18.404 --> 27:22.208
<i>Mele Kalikimaka.</i>
That's the thing to say.

27:22.241 --> 27:24.810
In blood, chained to the door
of County Animal Control,

27:24.844 --> 27:27.380
and I am screaming,
"No more pets have to die!"

27:27.413 --> 27:28.647
I'm sorry.

27:28.681 --> 27:30.016
"No more pets have to die."

27:30.049 --> 27:33.219
And then 20 minutes later,
I, uh--

27:33.252 --> 27:35.221
I find out I-I have
the wrong address,

27:35.254 --> 27:37.156
and I am chained to
the dentist's office next door.

27:37.189 --> 27:39.158
No!

27:39.191 --> 27:41.260
I guess I was a-a young man
with conviction.

27:41.293 --> 27:42.895
So what can I say?

27:42.928 --> 27:44.764
You know, it's embarrassing
to even think about it.

27:44.797 --> 27:47.066
No, no, it's so cute.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.407
You know, I'll be honest,
at the start of the night, I...

27:54.440 --> 27:56.075
I thought I was
in real trouble.

27:56.108 --> 27:59.211
Oh. Why is that?

27:59.245 --> 28:01.113
Well, I don't want
to burst your bubble,

28:01.147 --> 28:05.184
but you don't exactly make
the best first impression.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.852
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

28:06.886 --> 28:09.722
You seemed like you were
gonna be a huge piece of shit.

28:09.755 --> 28:11.323
Oh.

28:11.357 --> 28:15.361
Well, that's funny,
because you kind of seemed

28:15.394 --> 28:17.263
stuck up and weird.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.031
No, I didn't.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.933
You're right.

28:20.966 --> 28:23.903
You seemed
great from the beginning.

28:26.939 --> 28:28.274
So what's a stewardess
from L.A.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.976
doing on a-a D.C.
dating service?

28:31.010 --> 28:32.978
I'm doing research.

28:33.012 --> 28:36.816
I'm thinking
of doing some writing.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.818
You want to be a journalist.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.052
- Mm.
- No.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.987
Someone didn't read
my profile too closely.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.123
- Well, I--
- I want to write novels.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.391
- Oh.
- Romantic novels.

28:45.424 --> 28:46.459
Oh?

28:46.492 --> 28:48.394
Stop it. It's nothing smutty.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.329
No, no, no, that's--
that's fantastic.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.331
But, um...

28:52.364 --> 28:53.432
why D.C.?

28:53.466 --> 28:55.401
I mean, people come here
for depth--

28:55.434 --> 28:56.802
No, I really like it here.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.170
- You do?
- I- I don't know.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.438
People come here to make
a difference in the world.

28:59.472 --> 29:01.307
- Well...
- It's nice.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.775
I mean, God, I'm not naive.

29:02.808 --> 29:05.144
I know, everybody has
to make compromises.

29:05.177 --> 29:09.081
And, well, you probably know
that better than anyone.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.416
What do you mean by that?

29:11.750 --> 29:13.486
Come on. You know...

29:15.754 --> 29:16.889
I'm--I'm not sure I do.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.924
I mean, um,
i-it just must be difficult

29:18.958 --> 29:20.392
working for a man like that.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.794
A man like what?

29:21.827 --> 29:24.296
A man like Richard Nixon.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.266
He's just a little bit
of a liar, don't you think?

29:27.299 --> 29:28.868
Oh, right.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.837
And you think LBJ
was some kind of Boy Scout?

29:31.871 --> 29:34.440
Well, Nixon really takes it
to a whole other level.

29:34.473 --> 29:35.941
How so?

29:35.975 --> 29:38.177
Uh, the stuff about ending
the war, for one thing.

29:38.210 --> 29:39.845
He's drawn down troop levels
by two thirds

29:39.879 --> 29:41.180
since he's been in office.

29:41.213 --> 29:42.815
I saw on the news
he's increased bombings.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.518
Did the news also mention
that he signed Title IX

29:45.551 --> 29:46.919
or established

29:46.952 --> 29:47.987
the Environmental Protection
Agency?

29:48.020 --> 29:49.355
Wow.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.890
You've really talked yourself
into this, haven't you?

29:50.923 --> 29:52.992
Talked myself into what?

29:54.026 --> 29:55.094
Um...

29:57.163 --> 29:58.364
Maybe this wasn't

29:58.397 --> 29:59.932
the best topic
of conversation to bring up--

29:59.965 --> 30:01.200
- No, no, no, no, no, no..
- We don't have--John--

30:01.233 --> 30:03.002
What about you?
What--what about you?

30:03.035 --> 30:04.236
What about me?

30:04.270 --> 30:06.205
- Oh, come on.
- Uh...

30:06.238 --> 30:08.040
You're just like
all your liberal friends.

30:08.073 --> 30:10.943
You--you playact like you want
to save the world,

30:10.976 --> 30:12.545
when all you really care about
is finding a guy

30:12.578 --> 30:14.413
with enough bread
to pick up the check.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.124
Hoped you guys saved
room for the Baked Alaska.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.095
<i>I must have
been drunk when I said that.</i>

30:30.129 --> 30:31.597
<i>Now I've got Dick calling me</i>

30:31.830 --> 30:34.066
<i>'cause he's got Kissinger
up his ass again.</i>

30:35.267 --> 30:36.602
I should have said no to Dick

30:36.835 --> 30:39.905
the second he asked me
to come play politics out here.

30:39.939 --> 30:42.508
Should have stayed in New York.
Could have kept my practice.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.578
Hmm. We'd still have
our house Upstate.

30:45.611 --> 30:47.379
Remember when we used to drink

30:47.413 --> 30:49.081
a whole bottle
of blackberry wine

30:49.114 --> 30:51.250
and watch the moon
rise over the bay?

30:51.283 --> 30:53.586
- I miss those nights.
- Mm.

30:53.619 --> 30:56.355
I've got an idea.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.456
Let's catch a flight somewhere.

30:57.489 --> 31:01.060
We'll go to China,
India, New York.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.262
Dick needs me, honey bear.
You know that.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.997
The man's an emotional wreck.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.166
Without me, he wouldn't get
through to November.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.605
Of course.
Don't know what I was thinking.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.252
Hello?

31:26.285 --> 31:27.553
<i>Winnie, honey.</i>

31:27.586 --> 31:29.154
<i>You won't believe
the night I've had,</i>

31:29.188 --> 31:30.389
<i>a protester crashed...</i>

31:30.422 --> 31:32.057
Martha?

31:32.091 --> 31:33.459
<i>...the first lady's
miserable social evening.</i>

31:33.492 --> 31:35.027
Jesus, what time is it?

31:35.060 --> 31:37.529
Poor woman. They had to
drag her right off the stage.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.298
<i>How did you get my number?</i>

31:39.331 --> 31:41.133
Of course, my husband had to
leave me alone the whole night

31:41.166 --> 31:42.635
'cause he's busy playing
the middleman

31:42.668 --> 31:44.169
in this silly feud

31:44.203 --> 31:46.472
the president's got going
with Henry.

31:46.505 --> 31:48.007
<i>Henry?</i>

31:48.040 --> 31:50.643
<i>As in, like...</i>

31:50.676 --> 31:52.244
<i>Henry Kissinger?</i>

31:52.278 --> 31:54.179
I really shouldn't say.

32:15.968 --> 32:18.671
Father. May I?

32:23.309 --> 32:26.078
Raymond, what are you doing up?

32:29.114 --> 32:31.383
I was having bad dreams again.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.987
Are you okay, Father?

32:35.020 --> 32:38.324
Had a little whoopsie today
at work.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.159
What kind of whoopsie?

32:40.192 --> 32:43.595
Remember
when you were in art class

32:43.629 --> 32:46.565
and Miss Grimmer caught you
eating all the other kids' glue

32:46.598 --> 32:49.201
and all the other kids
laughed at you?

32:50.402 --> 32:53.072
All the other kids laughed
at me today, Raymond.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.387
Sometimes...

33:08.420 --> 33:11.724
when the other boys
at school laugh at me...

33:11.757 --> 33:14.393
Mother says I should make
friends with them.

33:14.426 --> 33:18.063
She says there are good ships

33:18.097 --> 33:19.631
and wood ships

33:19.665 --> 33:22.034
and ships that sail the sea,

33:22.067 --> 33:25.571
but the best ships
are friendships.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.432
Linda, would you put in a call

33:53.465 --> 33:56.802
to, uh, ah,
Harry Welch at the FAA?

33:57.035 --> 33:58.437
Have him send us
any information

33:58.470 --> 34:01.473
he has on a registered
flight attendant, Maureen Kane.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.308
Oh, and, uh, Liddy should be
here any minute

34:03.342 --> 34:05.144
- for the meeting.
- Uh, Liddy's already here.

34:05.177 --> 34:06.779
He arrived
over a half hour ago.

34:06.812 --> 34:08.814
He's already here? Where is he?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.315
Mitchell's office.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.050
- Jesus.
- You want me to go--

34:12.084 --> 34:13.619
I'm so sorry.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.053
Are they in there?

34:17.589 --> 34:19.491
Speak of the devil,
and he doth appear.

34:19.525 --> 34:20.526
What's the matter, Dean?

34:20.559 --> 34:22.161
You look
like you just got caught

34:22.194 --> 34:23.462
butt-fucking your sister.

34:23.495 --> 34:25.164
I don't have a-a sister, sir.

34:25.197 --> 34:26.598
Um...

34:26.632 --> 34:28.600
are we celebrating something?

34:28.634 --> 34:30.836
Wow, sharp as a tack.
Tell him, Liddy.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.638
I ran into Mr. Mitchell
this morning

34:32.671 --> 34:34.339
on the way into the office

34:34.373 --> 34:37.776
and I had a few rough ideas
for pared-down operations--

34:37.810 --> 34:39.244
sketches really.

34:39.278 --> 34:40.712
<i>Ah, don't beat yourself up.</i>

34:40.746 --> 34:42.314
We made some adjustments.

34:42.347 --> 34:43.782
It was all you, Mr. Mitchell.

34:43.816 --> 34:47.152
He helped me come up with
a whole new operation plan.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.755
This man truly knows
his tradecraft.

34:49.788 --> 34:54.226
Sir, are you sure
it's wise to be, um...

34:54.259 --> 34:58.430
casually discussing illicit
activities in your office?

34:58.464 --> 35:00.599
Teacher's here. Fun's over.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.301
<i>Well, no.</i>

35:03.368 --> 35:06.505
Gordo, fabulous work.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.674
Just, uh, talk to Jeb.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.676
He'll take care
of the logistics with you.

35:10.709 --> 35:13.212
Thank you, sir.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.781
Well, whatever you told
that chowderhead

35:15.814 --> 35:19.751
to get him to drop
the James Bond act, it worked.

35:19.785 --> 35:23.655
Well, I just, uh, showed him
how to be a team player, sir.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.658
Hmm. Tell you what...

35:26.692 --> 35:28.827
my wife is doing
a campaign fundraiser

35:28.861 --> 35:30.829
at our house Saturday.

35:30.863 --> 35:32.698
Why don't you come by?

35:32.731 --> 35:35.234
You know?
For all your hard work.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.602
I'd be honored, sir.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.171
And bring a date--
something nice on the eyes.

35:39.204 --> 35:40.739
Right. Okay.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.488
What the hell?

35:56.522 --> 35:58.423
Go, go, go.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.893
Mo. Hey.
I can't believe it.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.561
I was just about
to check in for my flight.

36:02.594 --> 36:03.896
And I was thinking,
what are the odds

36:03.929 --> 36:05.564
I'd run into Mo Kane
at the airport?

36:05.597 --> 36:07.499
And here you are.
That is crazy.

36:07.533 --> 36:09.468
Huh, how did you find me?

36:09.501 --> 36:11.937
Well, I just--I saw you
coming up the thing.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.206
- Where's your ticket?
- Excuse me?

36:14.239 --> 36:15.741
You said you were checking in
for your flight.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.276
You should have a ticket.

36:17.309 --> 36:18.510
Oh, right, ticket.

36:18.544 --> 36:20.412
Um, that--
that is a very good--

36:20.445 --> 36:22.748
Oh, you know, shoot,
I must have thrown it

36:22.781 --> 36:24.483
in the trash
with my food there.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.218
Um, I have to get
a new one now.

36:26.251 --> 36:27.519
Do you know the lady?
Maybe you can--

36:27.553 --> 36:28.854
You little psychopath.

36:28.887 --> 36:29.922
What?

36:29.955 --> 36:32.257
Did you call the FAA?

36:32.291 --> 36:33.692
Call the--

36:33.725 --> 36:36.261
No. What? No.

36:36.295 --> 36:37.930
Why would I--
why would I do that?

36:37.963 --> 36:39.398
To find out my flight schedule

36:39.431 --> 36:41.767
so you could manufacture
a way to bump into me

36:41.800 --> 36:43.602
in the futile hope
you could apologize your way

36:43.635 --> 36:45.304
into a second date.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.475
Has this--has this happened
to you before?

36:50.509 --> 36:52.344
It's a pilot trick.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.846
I have to say, it's never felt
quite so pathetic until now.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.517
Mo. Wait, please.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.718
- John.
- Please.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.986
You seem very nice.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.323
Do you know what it is?
I am looking for a man.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.558
And I can't waste my time
with little boys anymore.

37:06.592 --> 37:08.327
I know I was an asshole
the other night.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.394
Mm-hmm.

37:09.428 --> 37:10.529
But I want
to make it up to you.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.797
There's this fundraiser
next weekend,

37:11.830 --> 37:13.565
and everyone who's anyone
in D.C. is gonna be there.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.667
You want to take me
to a Republican fundraiser?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.569
It'll be great material
for your novel.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.271
And besides, we don't have
to talk to anybody.

37:19.304 --> 37:21.273
We can just sit
in the corner all night,

37:21.306 --> 37:23.508
drinking John Mitchell's
scotch, making fun of people--

37:23.542 --> 37:26.945
Um, John Mitchell?
Martha Mitchell's husband?

37:26.979 --> 37:28.447
Yeah. Why? You--you like her?

37:28.480 --> 37:30.349
She's completely insane.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.651
I love her.

37:32.684 --> 37:35.988
So you will go with me?

37:36.021 --> 37:39.758
Um, I'm gonna think about it.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.561
I'm gonna see when the airline
has me back in D.C.--

37:42.594 --> 37:44.663
Thursday. I-I mean...

37:44.696 --> 37:46.832
I hope they have you back
on Thursday

37:46.865 --> 37:49.968
because that would be, uh...
that would be perfect timing.

37:50.002 --> 37:52.471
Holy shit, man.

37:55.307 --> 37:57.843
- Do you have my number?
- Leave it with the FAA.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.598
- Ahoy!
- Oh! Ha ha!

38:19.631 --> 38:21.566
What the--

38:21.600 --> 38:23.635
Mitchell sent me
down to inform you

38:23.669 --> 38:25.837
he's approved of my plans.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.839
Now, before you fill
your diaper,

38:27.873 --> 38:30.676
you'll be relieved to know
that I've trimmed the budget

38:30.709 --> 38:33.011
to a manageable
quarter million.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.579
Hey, well,
that's fantastic news.

38:34.613 --> 38:35.614
That's great.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.750
Uh, only problem is, um...

38:39.885 --> 38:42.954
...Mitchell doesn't control
the purse strings around here.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.423
I do.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.426
So you're gonna have to make do
with $200,000.

38:47.459 --> 38:49.861
That's--that's all we got.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.631
Do you think this is a joke?

38:52.664 --> 38:53.732
No.

38:53.765 --> 38:56.768
This operation requires

38:56.802 --> 38:59.604
untraceable
foreign contractors.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.640
I need at least five Cubans.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.075
Cubans? Well, I mean,

39:03.108 --> 39:05.077
how- how expensive
are Cubans these days?

39:05.110 --> 39:08.980
Why--just get cheaper Cubans.
How about Puerto Ricans?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.852
Hmm.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.723
You've never tasted
your own blood.

39:17.756 --> 39:20.125
- Pardon me?
- You haven't. Ah...

39:21.593 --> 39:23.562
I can tell.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.530
You know that?

39:25.564 --> 39:28.700
You don't know the first thing
about passion,

39:28.734 --> 39:31.470
about <i>el sangre de libertad.</i>

39:31.503 --> 39:33.839
<i>But you know who does?</i>

39:33.872 --> 39:37.909
Those magnificent men
you just maligned.

39:37.943 --> 39:38.944
- Yeah.
- <i>They know.</i>

39:38.977 --> 39:40.045
God, I got to tell you,

39:40.078 --> 39:42.547
I-I don't appreciate
your tone, Gordo.

39:42.581 --> 39:43.582
No.

39:45.584 --> 39:48.920
They are freedom fighters,
you fuck!

39:48.954 --> 39:50.789
Please let go of me,
you psychopath.

39:50.822 --> 39:55.494
You prep-school sissies think
that you own the world...

39:55.527 --> 39:57.129
but you don't.

39:57.162 --> 40:00.132
The natural world rejects you.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.034
You taste your blood now,
don't you?

40:19.584 --> 40:22.020
Bean-counting Ivy League fag.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.459
Rough day?

40:28.927 --> 40:32.030
Never thought I'd encounter
a bureaucracy

40:32.063 --> 40:35.033
more stocked with vipers
than the FBI.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.637
A thousand petty tyrannies.

40:40.672 --> 40:42.040
You're a Bureau man?

40:42.073 --> 40:44.810
Five years strong. You?

40:44.843 --> 40:46.545
CIA.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.980
I've always admired Hoover.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.917
They don't make them
like him anymore.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.218
I agree.

40:55.487 --> 40:57.889
Jim McCord.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.559
Liddy, General Counsel.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.194
Liddy...

41:02.227 --> 41:05.597
fella who burnt himself
with a candle, right?

41:10.235 --> 41:12.971
Gaius Scaevola would be proud.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.874
Hero of Rome.

41:17.008 --> 41:20.745
Soldier.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.527
Oh, hi.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.495
Great shirt.

41:37.529 --> 41:39.531
Mo, he's here.

41:39.564 --> 41:40.765
Smells good in there.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.602
I, uh, smoked a little
grass myself back in college.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.807
Hi.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.544
Wow. You--

41:52.577 --> 41:53.712
you look--

41:53.745 --> 41:56.648
Thank you.
Anything for Martha Mitchell.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.594
All right.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.164
Welcome, sir, ma'am.

42:14.266 --> 42:15.600
- For you.
- Oh, thank you.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.635
Cheers.

42:16.668 --> 42:17.669
- Oh, hi. Hey.
- John.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.871
- How's it going?
- Hello. Hi.

42:19.905 --> 42:21.806
You have blood on your hands.

42:21.840 --> 42:23.275
- Look who it is. See?
- Oh, my God.

42:23.308 --> 42:25.777
- Want to go say hi?
- Yes, I want to say hi.

42:25.810 --> 42:27.946
- She looks amazing.
- So gorgeous.

42:27.979 --> 42:29.948
I want to get a picture.

42:29.981 --> 42:31.716
Aw.

42:31.750 --> 42:32.951
Excuse me, Mrs. Mitchell.

42:32.984 --> 42:34.586
Uh, my name is John Dean.
I work with your husband.

42:34.619 --> 42:35.820
Oh, Mr. Dean.

42:35.854 --> 42:37.589
Yes, my husband speaks
very highly of you.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.291
Say hello to Mr. Dean, buttercup.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.859
- Hi.
- Hello.

42:40.892 --> 42:43.929
Hmm.
We're working on her volume.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.597
Who is this vision in blue?

42:45.630 --> 42:47.832
Maureen Kane.
It's an honor to--

42:47.866 --> 42:49.668
I'm j- I'm a huge fan.

42:49.701 --> 42:50.936
Thank you.

42:50.969 --> 42:53.738
May I say the two of you
make a striking couple.

42:53.772 --> 42:54.940
Oh, we're not really--

42:54.973 --> 42:56.274
That's so sweet of you.
Thank you so much.

42:56.308 --> 42:57.575
Thank you. Thank you.

42:57.609 --> 42:59.577
All right, Mrs. Mitchell,
right over here.

42:59.611 --> 43:01.813
Oh. Picture?

43:01.846 --> 43:04.582
Are we getting in? Oh, my--

43:04.616 --> 43:05.817
Thank you.

43:05.850 --> 43:06.851
Mm-hmm.

43:06.885 --> 43:08.620
Enjoy yourselves.
Nice to meet you.

43:08.653 --> 43:11.056
- So nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

43:12.958 --> 43:15.160
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

43:19.998 --> 43:21.866
Okay, who are they,
the buzz cuts?

43:21.900 --> 43:23.068
Oh, that?

43:23.101 --> 43:25.070
Uh, that's the president's
chief of staff.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.338
On the right, Bob Haldeman.

43:26.371 --> 43:27.872
<i>Okay.</i>

43:27.906 --> 43:29.274
<i>On the left
is John Ehrlichman.</i>

43:29.307 --> 43:31.176
And nobody gets to Nixon
except through them.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.844
They call them the Berlin Wall.

43:32.877 --> 43:33.878
Hmm.

43:33.912 --> 43:36.181
- The Berlin Wall, huh?
- Mm.

43:36.214 --> 43:39.117
Hmm. Hmm.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.919
Wait, where you going?

43:40.952 --> 43:44.089
Mo. No. Mo. Mo. Mo, Mo.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.359
Now McGovern's got James Taylor
and Barbra Streisand

43:47.392 --> 43:48.727
stumping for him,

43:48.760 --> 43:50.128
as if the voters
are going to be swayed

43:50.161 --> 43:52.897
by a couple of moderately
fuckable socialists.

43:54.733 --> 43:57.202
I'm a big Streisand fan.
What's wrong with her?

43:57.235 --> 43:59.971
- Excuse me?
- Uh...

44:00.005 --> 44:01.873
sorry, y--you are?

44:01.906 --> 44:04.209
I'm Mo Kane.
I think you know my date.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.413
John Dean, sir.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.849
I got a haircut.

44:10.882 --> 44:13.151
Yes, that's it. Right.

44:13.184 --> 44:14.919
My apologies
if John caused any offense

44:14.953 --> 44:16.321
with the Streisand thing,
ma'am.

44:16.354 --> 44:19.224
Oh, God. Hey, as a-a member
in good standing

44:19.257 --> 44:21.359
of the league of moderately
fuckable socialists,

44:21.393 --> 44:23.228
I accept your apology.

44:23.261 --> 44:25.063
Where did you find
this one, Dean?

44:25.096 --> 44:28.366
<i>She's a live one.</i>

44:28.400 --> 44:31.336
Uh, by the way, Bob, I've been
meaning to, uh, thank you

44:31.369 --> 44:34.439
for conveying that message
from POTUS on my behalf.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.908
Mitchell told me about
the, uh, president's request

44:36.941 --> 44:39.411
that I come help with the
election compliance operations

44:39.444 --> 44:41.046
over at CREEP.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.781
Oh, uh, I'm--I'm sorry.

44:42.814 --> 44:44.682
I've never spoken about you
with the president

44:44.716 --> 44:47.786
or really anyone else
for that matter.

44:47.819 --> 44:49.287
Word of advice...

44:49.320 --> 44:52.424
learn to recognize a snake
when you see one.

44:52.457 --> 44:54.192
Hmm.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.371
Oh, God.
John, this party is crazy.

45:06.404 --> 45:08.239
Ehrlichman is a fascist.

45:08.273 --> 45:11.743
He wants to nuke all of Asia.
Everyone's so evil here.

45:11.776 --> 45:13.778
I'm having so much fun.
What's wrong?

45:13.812 --> 45:15.380
- You okay?
- It's nothing. We should go.

45:15.413 --> 45:16.714
No, we just got here.

45:16.748 --> 45:18.483
- I'll get our coats.
- Oh, okay.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.921
Uh, sir, Kissinger's office
just called.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.856
They've been trying to
reach you for the past hour.

45:24.889 --> 45:26.124
In regards to what?

45:26.191 --> 45:27.759
Apparently your wife
spoke out

45:27.826 --> 45:31.463
about some sort of feud
he's having with the president.

45:31.496 --> 45:33.131
<i>What the fuck?</i>

45:33.164 --> 45:35.333
Martha.

45:37.035 --> 45:38.303
God as my witness, woman,

45:38.336 --> 45:40.371
I will cancel
your Diners Club card

45:40.405 --> 45:43.374
if you don't open
this door right now.

45:43.408 --> 45:44.843
What? What do you want?

45:44.876 --> 45:46.444
You want to berate me
in front of our guests?

45:53.284 --> 45:55.086
Oh, fuck me! Jesus!

45:55.120 --> 45:57.021
Ah.

45:57.055 --> 45:58.957
I mean...

45:58.990 --> 46:00.492
Sorry.

46:03.394 --> 46:07.232
- Are you okay?
- I hate this stupid dress.

46:07.265 --> 46:09.334
My mom had it made for me.

46:09.367 --> 46:12.270
I look like Little Bo Peep.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.876
You want a Doublemint?

46:17.909 --> 46:19.344
No, thanks.

46:24.983 --> 46:26.317
Cigarette?

46:27.886 --> 46:29.354
It's just
an interview, for God's sake.

46:29.387 --> 46:31.022
It's not the end of the world.

46:31.055 --> 46:33.958
You had to mention Kissinger,
like I need more enemies.

46:33.992 --> 46:35.426
"Martha Mitchell bares all."

46:35.460 --> 46:37.896
Is this some kind of
retribution for the other night

46:37.929 --> 46:40.165
'cause I didn't just drop everything

46:40.198 --> 46:43.201
and whisk Martha
off to some foreign land

46:43.234 --> 46:44.536
or wherever the fuck?

46:44.569 --> 46:47.005
Yeah. So you--you do know
I have feelings.

46:47.038 --> 46:48.406
You just choose to ignore them.

46:48.439 --> 46:51.009
I see. I'm sure if he asked
to go on vacation,

46:51.042 --> 46:53.111
you'd have your bags packed
in one hour.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.379
He's my boss.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.080
He's your life.

46:56.114 --> 46:58.917
You roll over
for him day and night.

46:58.950 --> 47:00.919
- My God. My God.
- What is the draw, really?

47:00.952 --> 47:03.154
- Tell me. The subservience--
- That's enough.

47:03.188 --> 47:05.423
Is it that he makes you feel
like a big man,

47:05.456 --> 47:07.959
- makes you feel wanted?
- That's enough, Martha.

47:07.992 --> 47:10.395
I mean, your dick
must look so big

47:10.428 --> 47:12.497
in his tiny hands.

47:19.103 --> 47:23.441
Look, let's just both
take a breath.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.379
You take a fucking breath.

47:28.413 --> 47:30.982
My mama slaps me
harder than that.

47:35.119 --> 47:37.055
<i>You're a--you're a pig!</i>

47:37.088 --> 47:38.957
<i>All day--</i>

47:42.994 --> 47:44.862
<i>Nobody cares what you think!</i>

47:48.132 --> 47:52.136
They used to like each other
before we moved here.

47:52.170 --> 47:55.907
Now everything's just terrible.

47:55.940 --> 47:59.544
<i>I hate parties.
I hate all of these people.</i>

47:59.577 --> 48:00.645
How old are you?

48:00.878 --> 48:03.014
Eleven and a half.

48:03.047 --> 48:05.917
What you need
is an exit strategy.

48:05.950 --> 48:08.486
<i>You can petition
for emancipation at 16.</i>

48:08.519 --> 48:11.122
Seems a little extreme.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.028
And that isn't?

48:19.030 --> 48:20.231
Do you have a business card?

48:23.501 --> 48:26.671
I will represent you pro bono.

48:26.904 --> 48:28.239
<i>I'd get started now,</i>

48:28.273 --> 48:31.209
<i>but, uh, I'm a little busy
with the president.</i>

48:31.242 --> 48:33.678
My mom says Nixon's dogshit.

48:36.214 --> 48:38.349
Honestly, I wouldn't know.

48:38.383 --> 48:40.351
I've never even met the guy.

48:46.924 --> 48:47.992
Bye.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.699
- You ready?
- Yeah.

48:58.569 --> 49:02.407
The election is in eight
fucking months, Martha.

49:02.440 --> 49:07.178
<i>You can just keep your mouth
shut for eight months,</i>

49:07.211 --> 49:08.713
<i>we'll be fine.</i>

49:08.946 --> 49:11.349
Get another wife
if you want a silent one

49:11.382 --> 49:14.052
or marry that portrait
I had made for you,

49:14.085 --> 49:16.487
which you never
thanked me for, by the way.

49:19.524 --> 49:22.093
You want to know
the truth, Martha?

49:24.028 --> 49:25.997
There's no conspiracy
against you.

49:26.030 --> 49:30.435
<i>There's no collusion
hiding in the shadows.</i>

49:30.468 --> 49:35.073
People just don't like you.

49:35.106 --> 49:38.543
<i>That's why we can't fly
on</i> Air Force One.

49:38.576 --> 49:40.078
Oh, and those journalists

49:40.111 --> 49:42.080
that you call
in the middle of night--

49:42.113 --> 49:43.581
they're not your friends.

49:45.583 --> 49:49.320
They just can't take
their eyes off a good show.

50:21.486 --> 50:23.688
Bob Haldeman sees my name
on six memos a day.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.591
Has no fucking idea who I am.

50:26.624 --> 50:29.293
Oh, important people
are only as important

50:29.327 --> 50:31.095
as the rest of us make them.

50:31.129 --> 50:33.765
Just don't give
them that power.

50:38.136 --> 50:39.604
You're very wise.

50:39.637 --> 50:41.672
You sound surprised.

50:43.207 --> 50:46.110
These fucking people.

50:46.144 --> 50:48.613
I think it's a good thing
you're not like those people.

50:48.646 --> 50:51.149
You're better than them.

50:51.182 --> 50:53.818
- You barely know me.
- That is true.

50:55.720 --> 50:58.656
But I do know you
well enough to know

50:58.689 --> 51:01.392
that you're
a good person deep down,

51:01.426 --> 51:03.428
even when no one's watching.

51:05.329 --> 51:08.166
But then I also know
that you used the FAA

51:08.199 --> 51:12.236
to find out my flight schedule,
which is a huge red flag,

51:12.270 --> 51:14.806
but it did show
uncanny initiative.

51:14.839 --> 51:16.507
Oh...

51:16.541 --> 51:18.476
And I know your dirty secret.

51:20.645 --> 51:23.347
In the moments
when you shut up,

51:23.381 --> 51:26.584
you actually know
how to listen.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.753
- Wait, I know how to shut up.
- Stop talking.

51:28.786 --> 51:31.122
- Wha--
- Stop fucking talking.

51:33.324 --> 51:34.659
I'm stopping.

51:53.478 --> 51:56.147
Which one's your house?

52:09.694 --> 52:11.729
Met a young couple tonight.

52:11.762 --> 52:15.233
Reminded me
of a long time ago...

52:15.266 --> 52:18.803
being at the beginning
of something.

52:18.836 --> 52:21.272
I'm sorry, I didn't know
anybody was out here.

52:21.305 --> 52:22.573
That's quite all right.

52:23.908 --> 52:25.676
Would you happen
to have a cigarette?

52:29.747 --> 52:31.549
Thank you.

52:41.592 --> 52:45.730
I hope I'm not out of line
here, Mrs. Mitchell, but...

52:45.763 --> 52:47.732
I wanted to tell you
that I read

52:47.765 --> 52:50.568
your <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> interview.

52:50.601 --> 52:54.472
There aren't many honest people
left in this town.

52:54.505 --> 52:56.274
I believe you're one of them.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.413
Well, thank you.

53:02.446 --> 53:04.181
McCord, wasn't it?

53:04.215 --> 53:06.584
Yes, ma'am, James McCord.

53:06.617 --> 53:08.819
I appreciate you, James McCord.

53:14.792 --> 53:16.594
Ma'am.

53:27.638 --> 53:32.510
Mmm.

53:35.947 --> 53:37.481
Mmm.

53:37.515 --> 53:39.984
Fetch the sugar
for me, would you, dear?

54:02.373 --> 54:03.541
California?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.543
We got a couple of fundraisers
out there.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.645
I thought it'd give you
a chance

54:07.678 --> 54:10.781
to try on
that new swimsuit of yours.

54:10.815 --> 54:13.651
The one with the cutouts?

54:13.684 --> 54:16.854
I don't know if that's
appropriate for a public beach.

54:16.887 --> 54:18.823
Well...

54:18.856 --> 54:21.993
maybe you and I could find

54:22.026 --> 54:24.929
something a bit more...

54:24.962 --> 54:26.564
secluded.

54:31.869 --> 54:34.405
I want to go
to boarding school.

54:46.717 --> 54:47.818
<i>You know, John,</i>

54:47.852 --> 54:49.787
whatever it is
they're making you do...

54:51.389 --> 54:53.290
...you don't have to do it.

54:54.925 --> 54:56.594
Just saying
you always have a choice.

55:26.390 --> 55:28.959
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Mitchell's out for the day.

55:28.993 --> 55:30.428
Oh--

55:30.461 --> 55:32.329
But you can leave that
on his desk if you'd like.

55:32.363 --> 55:35.066
Right.

55:35.099 --> 55:37.034
<i>Mr. Mitchell's office.</i>

56:14.538 --> 56:15.973
Mr. Dean,

56:16.006 --> 56:18.676
uh, I can hold on
to that if you want.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.812
<i>Give it to Mr. Mitchell
personally when he comes in.</i>

56:21.846 --> 56:24.682
Don't worry about the letter.

56:24.715 --> 56:27.752
It was a false alarm.

56:27.785 --> 56:29.019
<i>The names of great men</i>

56:29.053 --> 56:30.855
<i>are etched
in the halls of power...</i>

56:30.888 --> 56:31.956
I'll see myself out.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.457
<i>...Napoleon...</i>

56:33.491 --> 56:34.625
Thank you.

56:34.658 --> 56:37.061
<i>...Alexander, Charlemagne.</i>

56:38.896 --> 56:42.533
<i>But who will tell our stories
when we're gone?</i>

56:42.566 --> 56:44.668
<i>Who will sing our songs?</i>

56:47.705 --> 56:50.775
<i>For not all men who change
the world are remembered.</i>

56:52.143 --> 56:55.546
<i>Most are lost
like embers in a fire.</i>

56:57.148 --> 57:00.017
<i>Some worship
at the boot of power,</i>

57:00.050 --> 57:02.553
<i>weak against the tide
of human frailty.</i>

57:02.586 --> 57:05.022
I know your spot right there.

57:05.055 --> 57:07.825
<i>Others are born
to be forgotten,</i>

57:07.858 --> 57:10.861
<i>reaching for a greatness
they can never fully grasp.</i>

57:20.070 --> 57:22.706
There she is, <i>machos...</i>

57:22.740 --> 57:24.508
our destiny.

57:24.542 --> 57:26.210
<i>¿Qué es eso?</i>

57:26.443 --> 57:27.978
<i>El Watergate.</i>

57:33.751 --> 57:37.221
<i>But make no mistake...</i>

57:37.454 --> 57:39.657
<i>a triumphant will
is what binds us</i>

57:39.690 --> 57:42.760
<i>to those creatures
from the prehistoric sea.</i>

57:44.662 --> 57:49.533
<i>And with it, we can alter
the course of human history.</i>

58:28.205 --> 58:30.574
Ow!
