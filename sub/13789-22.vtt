00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:06.006 --> 00:10.041
Your name is Gracie,
which rhymes with dumb face-y.

00:11.342 --> 00:12.743
Stop teasing me.

00:12.743 --> 00:14.345
Stop teasing me.

00:14.345 --> 00:15.616
Stop copying me.

00:15.616 --> 00:17.188
Stop copying me.

00:17.188 --> 00:18.419
I'm stupid.

00:18.419 --> 00:21.322
I'm stupid. Hey!

00:21.322 --> 00:26.297
Dada, Gracie made me
call me stupid.

00:26.297 --> 00:27.928
Enough already!

00:27.928 --> 00:30.000
You kids have been
at each other for days.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.462
Keep fighting
and you're gonna get it.

00:31.462 --> 00:32.803
What is "it"?

00:32.803 --> 00:34.705
Is "it" ice cream?

00:34.705 --> 00:36.437
That would be delicious!

00:36.437 --> 00:38.669
Wait-- no!

00:40.471 --> 00:42.613
STAN: I just don't know
how to discipline my puppies.

00:42.613 --> 00:44.275
I'm out of my depth.

00:44.275 --> 00:47.278
Robert, how do you get your
kids to be so well-behaved?

00:47.278 --> 00:50.281
No, Robert, I can't have
my children stuffed

00:50.281 --> 00:53.023
with premium polyester
toy filling.

00:53.023 --> 00:54.785
I'm not saying it's wrong,

00:54.785 --> 00:57.428
I'm just saying
it's wrong for us.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.249
( alarm beeping )

01:19.480 --> 01:21.682
Yes! A new day!

01:23.013 --> 01:24.785
Wow, you're excited today.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.187
Usually you're like

01:26.187 --> 01:28.018
"Ugh, can't I just
sleep a little more?

01:28.018 --> 01:30.191
Aah! The sun's too bright!"

01:30.191 --> 01:32.463
Aah, the sun's
too bright!

01:32.463 --> 01:34.725
No, wait. I'm the one
who says that.

01:36.567 --> 01:39.099
Today is a big day, Stan.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.572
I got my learner's permit
and I'm off to drive!

01:44.875 --> 01:46.537
Need pants to drive!

01:49.580 --> 01:52.112
Dad, come on!
We've got to get going.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.944
I've got my learner's permit

01:53.944 --> 01:57.117
and I'm ready
to dominate the road!

01:57.117 --> 01:58.849
By setting a good example
for other drivers.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.523
I remember when I got
my learner's permit.

02:02.523 --> 02:04.295
It was a Wednesday.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.398
I never said
it was an interesting story.

02:10.161 --> 02:12.763
Being "permitted" to learn...

02:12.763 --> 02:16.106
that gives me an idea for a book
about a dystopian future

02:16.106 --> 02:18.369
where only the privileged
can study,

02:18.369 --> 02:22.443
until one courageous young girl
brings education to all,

02:22.443 --> 02:25.416
including the ridiculously
handsome boy who says,

02:25.416 --> 02:28.879
"You taught me how to read--
and to love."

02:28.879 --> 02:31.422
She better only teach him
how to read.

02:31.422 --> 02:33.824
All right.
Now let's hit the road.

02:34.885 --> 02:36.187
Yes!

02:36.187 --> 02:37.588
I'm going to be
great at driving.

02:39.430 --> 02:42.132
I'm not great at driving.

02:42.132 --> 02:44.595
She ran over
a garden gnome.

02:44.595 --> 02:47.468
I'm gonna go scrape
gnome butt off the bumper.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.344
Oh, my gosh, Avery,
you're a gnomicidal maniac.

02:53.344 --> 02:55.806
Better call gnomeland security!

02:55.806 --> 02:59.650
We can rebuild him
if we go to Gnome Depot.

02:59.650 --> 03:01.482
Unless you're going to make
a Noam Chomsky joke,

03:01.482 --> 03:03.053
I don't want to hear any more.

03:03.053 --> 03:05.516
Avery, you just
ran over Noam Chomsky!

03:05.516 --> 03:08.389
I don't know who that is,
but I'm pretty sure it works.

03:13.664 --> 03:15.496
Hey, can I have
some juice too, Mom?

03:15.496 --> 03:17.498
Sure.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.470
It's funny, I could've sworn
you just called me "Mom"

03:19.470 --> 03:20.501
instead of "Mommy."

03:20.501 --> 03:23.133
I did, Mom.

03:23.133 --> 03:26.036
If I were drinking, that would
have been a spit take.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.438
Like this.

03:30.180 --> 03:32.483
Are you sure? "Mom"?

03:32.483 --> 03:35.085
I'm nine.
I'm a near pre-tween.

03:35.085 --> 03:36.647
That's what my age
group is called.

03:36.647 --> 03:38.719
You call you age group
called pre-super oldies.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.292
Then comes super-oldies,
then post-super-oldies.

03:41.292 --> 03:42.453
Also known as ghosts.

03:44.255 --> 03:45.496
You know what?

03:45.496 --> 03:48.198
If you're ready to call me
"Mom," then that's great.

03:48.198 --> 03:49.600
You are getting older.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.502
Old enough to help your
mom clean up this juice.

03:51.502 --> 03:53.704
(laughing)
Oh, Mom!

03:55.766 --> 03:57.668
No, no more skipping.

03:57.668 --> 03:59.009
You're a near pre-tween.

04:00.611 --> 04:02.513
How do people do this?
It feels so slow!

04:04.144 --> 04:06.647
Hah! "Mom"?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.619
I mean I'm happy Chloe's
growing up, Stan,

04:08.619 --> 04:10.481
but it also makes me
kind of sad.

04:10.481 --> 04:11.852
You know what makes me sad?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.784
My kids are always fighting.

04:13.784 --> 04:15.486
Well, that and seasonal
beverages.

04:15.486 --> 04:18.659
I want eggnog now!

04:18.659 --> 04:20.661
Wait, why am I talking
to you about Chloe

04:20.661 --> 04:23.994
when I've got a parenting
expert in the other room?

04:23.994 --> 04:26.597
No, I am not a pre-super-oldie.

04:26.597 --> 04:28.699
I'm gonna skip.

04:28.699 --> 04:30.140
Oh, my knee.

04:30.140 --> 04:31.572
Ow! My hip.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.243
Whoa! Something
went soft.

04:35.105 --> 04:36.647
Parenting expert.

04:36.647 --> 04:38.609
Maybe Bennett can tell me
how to get my kids

04:38.609 --> 04:40.250
to stop fighting.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.482
Excuse me, Ellen.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.688
So I need to talk
to you about Chloe.

04:49.660 --> 04:51.762
( phone ringing )

04:51.762 --> 04:54.294
Sorry, hon,
it's my office line.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.566
Wish I had a receptionist,

04:55.566 --> 04:57.067
it's probably
a patient calling.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.069
Okay, okay, I'll be back.

05:02.833 --> 05:05.135
(imitates female) Hello,
Dr. Bennett James's office.

05:05.135 --> 05:07.277
How may I help you?

05:07.277 --> 05:09.740
Bennett has a receptionist?

05:09.740 --> 05:13.043
And with the voice of an angel.

05:13.043 --> 05:15.346
I'm a huge fan
of Dr. James's books.

05:15.346 --> 05:16.687
Can I speak with him?

05:16.687 --> 05:19.720
Dr. James, there's
a fan calling for you.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.552
Thank you, Wanda.

05:21.552 --> 05:23.924
Though you'll never have
a bigger fan than me.

05:23.924 --> 05:27.828
Oh, Wanda.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.230
Hello, this is Dr. James.
Can I help you?

05:30.230 --> 05:33.504
Oh, yes.
My name is, um...

05:33.504 --> 05:35.366
hmm--Chair. Chairy. Jerry.

05:35.366 --> 05:39.009
That's right, Jerry.
Jerry Table.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.841
Sheesh.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.643
I need parenting advice.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.315
Well, Mr. Table,
I'm always happy to help.

05:45.315 --> 05:48.519
Please, call me Chair.
Chairy. Jerry.

05:48.519 --> 05:51.021
The thing is, my kids
fight all the time,

05:51.021 --> 05:52.723
and I just don't
know what to do.

05:52.723 --> 05:55.255
Well, Jerry, it's best
to let siblings

05:55.255 --> 05:57.788
develop their own tools
for conflict resolution

05:57.788 --> 05:59.059
without parental intervention.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.691
That sounds
really complicated.

06:00.691 --> 06:01.862
Just do nothing.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.695
You're approaching
my wheelhouse.

06:04.695 --> 06:07.067
Listen I gotta get going.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.700
My wife is having a problem
with my nine-year-old daughter.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.902
Oh, because she stopped
calling her "Mommy"?

06:11.902 --> 06:12.973
What makes you think that?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.906
Ah, well, ya see--

06:15.906 --> 06:18.278
(imitates female) Mr. Table,
your 11 o'clock is here.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.110
Thanks, Wanda!

06:20.110 --> 06:22.783
Your receptionist
is named Wanda too?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.186
Hello?

06:28.819 --> 06:31.121
Ellen, I just had
the oddest conversation.

06:31.121 --> 06:33.624
I don't know
what to do, Bennett.

06:33.624 --> 06:35.866
Chloe wants to call me "Mom,"
instead of "Mommy."

06:35.866 --> 06:38.799
What? Are you kidding?
No. Of course not.

06:38.799 --> 06:42.703
Did I say "Good one, Ellen"?
I make it very clear
when I'm kidding.

06:42.703 --> 06:45.776
Jerry, the guy I was
just talking to, was right.

06:45.776 --> 06:48.108
He said that Chloe stopped
calling you "Mommy."

06:48.108 --> 06:50.741
How did he know?
Maybe he's psychic.

06:50.741 --> 06:53.944
Did he say I would someday
inherit Steincrotch Abbey?

06:53.944 --> 06:56.086
Because I'm not related
to those Steincrotches,

06:56.086 --> 06:57.948
but I've had my heart
set on a clerical error.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.093
Yeah, listen.

07:03.093 --> 07:05.926
Chloe is growing up, hon,
she's changing.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.397
That's a good thing.

07:07.397 --> 07:10.631
I know being sad about
Chloe growing up is silly.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.433
I mean, she couldn't be
our cute little one forever.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.805
I just didn't want her
to stop

07:14.805 --> 07:16.767
being our cute little one
so soon.

07:16.767 --> 07:20.471
I guess that time's over.

07:20.471 --> 07:23.213
So, you see that I have
ice packs all over me.

07:23.213 --> 07:24.945
You're not going to say
anything about this?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.848
Because it has been
a harrowing morning, Bennett.

07:27.848 --> 07:29.850
Apparently,
I am a pre-super-oldie.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.351
Then I skipped
and something went soft

07:31.351 --> 07:32.753
and now I have a hot spot
on my leg

07:32.753 --> 07:34.555
that I think is cooking
these peas!

07:38.859 --> 07:41.962
Now check
your rear-view mirror.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.795
Okay, now let's turn up there
and we'll gnome around

07:44.795 --> 07:46.597
the neighborhood.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.999
What?
Did you say "gnome"?

07:48.999 --> 07:52.773
Aaaaah!
Who are you?!

07:52.773 --> 07:55.646
I'm the gnome
you ran over and destroyed.

07:55.646 --> 07:57.207
One day from retirement.

07:58.509 --> 08:00.881
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

08:00.881 --> 08:03.253
Then why are you mowing
down the rest of my family?

08:03.253 --> 08:06.917
Daffodil! Rosemary!
Cranky! Sloppy! Doofus!

08:06.917 --> 08:08.959
Didn't know that guy.

08:08.959 --> 08:13.123
Twinkles! Itchy!
Lefty! Bugsy! Two Toes!

08:13.123 --> 08:15.295
Will you please hit the brakes?!

08:15.295 --> 08:16.527
( tires screeching )

08:16.527 --> 08:18.128
( screaming )

08:23.604 --> 08:25.876
Tyler, that is not funny!

08:25.876 --> 08:28.338
Which just goes to show you,
comedy is subjective.

08:37.487 --> 08:38.919
Aah! Don't run over me!

08:41.321 --> 08:43.854
Don't worry, Tyler.
I'm not driving.

08:43.854 --> 08:45.656
I know.

08:45.656 --> 08:47.928
If you were driving,
you'd be on the front lawn.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.560
If you were driving,
there'd be mangled

08:49.560 --> 08:51.632
gnome bodies in your path.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.363
If you were driving--
Tyler!

08:53.363 --> 08:55.505
No, no, I have got one more.
If you were driving-- dang it!

08:55.505 --> 08:57.237
You made me forget!
I hope you're happy!

08:58.969 --> 09:00.971
I'm never driving again.

09:00.971 --> 09:03.774
My book is now about
a courageous young girl

09:03.774 --> 09:05.846
who takes public transportation

09:05.846 --> 09:08.719
with the ridiculously
handsome boy who says,

09:08.719 --> 09:13.023
"You taught me how to ride
the bus-- and to love."

09:13.023 --> 09:15.025
This isn't all
because of the gnome, is it?

09:15.025 --> 09:16.657
And me putting
the gnome in your bed?

09:16.657 --> 09:17.928
And me changing the wallpaper

09:17.928 --> 09:19.159
on your phone
to pictures of gnomes?

09:19.159 --> 09:21.161
What?

09:21.161 --> 09:23.093
Tyler!

09:23.093 --> 09:25.596
Look, I'm sorry if I took
the teasing too far.

09:25.596 --> 09:28.068
But if you're freaked out
about driving, let me help you.

09:28.068 --> 09:32.102
You helped me when I wanted
to graduate early,
and it meant so much,

09:32.102 --> 09:33.674
and then you taught me
how to play the spoons.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.706
I didn't teach you
how to play the spoons.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.277
Then how did I learn this?

09:38.578 --> 09:41.351
( rhythmic clacking )

09:45.916 --> 09:48.358
Look I mean it, Avery.

09:48.358 --> 09:52.893
I'm your big brother.
I may not always act like it,
but I do care about you.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.726
So what do you say?

09:55.726 --> 09:57.067
Let me help you
with your driving.

09:57.067 --> 10:00.030
Well, that's very sweet, Tyler.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.672
Okay. Let's give it a try.

10:01.672 --> 10:03.033
Awesome.

10:04.935 --> 10:06.106
Seriously,
who taught me this?

10:10.440 --> 10:13.644
Ehhhh....

10:13.644 --> 10:15.215
Freddy, stop!

10:15.215 --> 10:16.787
Stop what?

10:16.787 --> 10:20.150
This? Ehhh.....

10:20.150 --> 10:21.922
Dada, make him stop!

10:21.922 --> 10:26.056
Freddy, would you
please-- No, no.

10:26.056 --> 10:28.699
It's up to you guys
to develop your own tools

10:28.699 --> 10:31.732
for conflict resolution,
like Bennett said.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.735
So work it out.
Okay, Dada.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.436
Let's see how you
like it.

10:36.436 --> 10:41.241
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-
yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi...

10:41.241 --> 10:44.014
I think they're
working it out.

10:44.014 --> 10:47.878
Ehhh....
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi...

10:47.878 --> 10:50.881
Stop it! Just stop it!

10:53.123 --> 10:54.825
What's wrong with him?

10:54.825 --> 10:56.987
I think he has
a bad case of

10:56.987 --> 11:00.791
ehhhh.....
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi...

11:02.162 --> 11:05.365
Hey, Chloe.
Never have puppies.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.739
So what are you doing?

11:08.739 --> 11:11.341
I heard my mom say I wasn't
the little cute one anymore.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.003
So I'm watching
home movies to figure out

11:13.003 --> 11:14.374
how to get my cute back.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.376
I don't know what Ellen's
talking about.

11:16.376 --> 11:20.150
I'm no expert on people cute,
but your hair is poodle-y

11:20.150 --> 11:22.612
and you always have
food on your fingers.

11:22.612 --> 11:24.955
I mean, you got a lot
going for you, Chloe.

11:28.118 --> 11:29.720
Look at that technique.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.622
Notice my hopeful,
innocent expression.

11:32.622 --> 11:35.595
That's all natural.
You can't teach that.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.667
So what do you think, Stan?

11:37.667 --> 11:40.300
If I put on those PJs
and find a baby pig

11:40.300 --> 11:44.174
and get in that little car,
that will be really, really...

11:44.174 --> 11:46.676
sad.

11:46.676 --> 11:48.708
Or it could be adorable.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.980
It's hard to know
until we see it.

11:52.442 --> 11:54.284
Yeah, that's pretty sad.

11:54.284 --> 11:56.747
Should have trusted
your gut, Chloe.

11:56.747 --> 11:58.688
If I'm not the cute one anymore,

11:58.688 --> 12:00.090
I'm gonna have to find
something else.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.222
Wait a minute.
That's not even a pig.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.854
It's a hairless guinea pig.

12:03.854 --> 12:05.125
I couldn't find a real pig.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.057
Well, can you put a coat
on it or something?

12:07.057 --> 12:09.159
I'm feeling kind of
uncomfortable.

12:12.362 --> 12:16.006
Okay, I've driven
you to this empty lot.
There's no one around.

12:16.006 --> 12:18.368
You can't hit anyone
or do any damage.

12:18.368 --> 12:20.470
You need a licensed driver
twenty-five years or older

12:20.470 --> 12:22.042
in the car, and we got
Mr. Trummer here,

12:22.042 --> 12:23.273
so we're all set to go.

12:23.273 --> 12:25.215
I believe
I was promised soup.

12:31.181 --> 12:33.183
Oh! This tastes weak.

12:33.183 --> 12:35.025
Like your entire generation.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.028
All right, let's get going.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.359
Start the car.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.660
Okay.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.462
I can do this. Easy day.

12:45.335 --> 12:48.238
I can't. I'm sorry.
I can't learn this way.

12:48.238 --> 12:51.171
I'm used to learning things
by myself, in my room.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.402
So just close your eyes,

12:52.402 --> 12:54.204
pretend you're in your
room, and drive.

12:54.204 --> 12:57.978
This is why we have someone
over twenty-five in the car.

12:57.978 --> 13:01.011
Don't drive
with your eyes closed.

13:01.011 --> 13:03.383
Come on, Avery,
why can't you just do this?

13:03.383 --> 13:06.586
(mumbles) I'm afraid to fail
in front of other people.
What?

13:06.586 --> 13:09.189
I'm afraid to fail
in front of other people.
What?

13:09.189 --> 13:11.561
She's afraid to fail
in front of other people!

13:11.561 --> 13:13.123
Here, you want to borrow this?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.197
I was afraid to fail
in front of Mom and Dad

13:17.197 --> 13:18.768
because their opinions matter,

13:18.768 --> 13:20.700
so I thought it'd be
easier with you two.

13:21.932 --> 13:23.503
None taken.

13:24.935 --> 13:28.108
I just can't do it.
I give up.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.041
If you woulda had that
kind of attitude, Tyler,

13:31.041 --> 13:33.183
you never would have learned
how to play the spoons.

13:33.183 --> 13:35.185
You're the one!

13:37.087 --> 13:39.749
( rhythmic clacking )

13:47.097 --> 13:49.559
CHLOE: So I've been
working out a little.

13:49.559 --> 13:50.901
Aah!

13:52.632 --> 13:53.803
What are you wearing?

13:53.803 --> 13:55.665
M'muscles.

13:58.168 --> 14:00.270
I'm the strong one
in the family.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.942
Check it out.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.977
Aarrgh!

14:09.219 --> 14:10.580
Huh!

14:10.580 --> 14:12.252
Chloe honey, I have
to make dinner.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.085
Why don't you go play dress-up
in the other room, okay?

14:15.085 --> 14:16.987
Take this fake rock
with you.

14:16.987 --> 14:19.589
Whoa! It still has heft!
My back went out.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.263
Do you even lift, brah?

14:28.638 --> 14:30.800
Chloe, that's a fun costume.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.803
It's not a costume.
It's who I want to be.

14:33.803 --> 14:37.477
Why won't anyone
take me seriously?!

14:37.477 --> 14:42.152
Oh, man, I really shredded
my quads this morning.

14:42.152 --> 14:45.685
Ohhh! Ah! Ohh!

14:45.685 --> 14:47.287
Ahaha!

14:47.287 --> 14:50.160
Ohh! Oww!

14:50.160 --> 14:52.522
Ow! Ow!!!

14:52.522 --> 14:54.124
Ow ow ow!

14:55.195 --> 14:57.897
That was weird.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.700
I wonder what Mr. Table
would have to say about that.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.104
So do I, Bennett.
So do I.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.106
( phone ringing )

15:08.378 --> 15:10.910
(imitating female)
Dr. Bennett James's office.
How may I help you?

15:10.910 --> 15:15.345
(imitating female)
Oh hi, this is Wanda
in Jerry Table's office

15:15.345 --> 15:16.947
calling for Dr. James.

15:16.947 --> 15:20.720
Oh, Wanda, hi!
This is Wanda!

15:22.022 --> 15:23.853
I've heard so much about you.

15:23.853 --> 15:25.495
Me too, doll.

15:25.495 --> 15:27.727
We'll have to do
lunch sometime.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.100
Yes, that would be
delightful!

15:33.463 --> 15:34.965
Dr. James? This is Jerry.

15:34.965 --> 15:36.806
Hi, Jerry.

15:36.806 --> 15:38.468
I'm--I'm so glad you called.

15:38.468 --> 15:41.111
Listen, How did you know
that my daughter

15:41.111 --> 15:43.413
was going to stop
calling my wife "Mommy"?

15:43.413 --> 15:45.915
There's only one possible
explanation.

15:45.915 --> 15:47.677
I'm your dog.
What?

15:47.677 --> 15:49.219
No, I'm just kidding.

15:49.219 --> 15:52.052
I'm a regular insightful
stranger.

15:52.052 --> 15:55.185
Don't tell me.
Now your daughter's
dressing up as a strongwoman

15:55.185 --> 15:57.227
and complaining that no one
is taking her seriously.

15:57.227 --> 15:59.429
How did you know that?

15:59.429 --> 16:01.391
Is my wife going to
inherit Steincrotch Abbey

16:01.391 --> 16:02.832
through a clerical error?

16:02.832 --> 16:06.336
Well, I can't really
say, Lord Steincrotch.

16:07.497 --> 16:09.369
Look, your daughter
may be upset

16:09.369 --> 16:11.701
because people think she isn't
the little cute one anymore

16:11.701 --> 16:14.304
and she doesn't know what makes
her special in the family.

16:14.304 --> 16:16.306
That's really helpful.

16:16.306 --> 16:19.509
If you are ever looking
to be a gentleman's valet,

16:19.509 --> 16:23.283
there will always be a position
for you at Steincrotch Abbey.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.187
Anyway,
why were you calling?

16:27.187 --> 16:30.120
Well, letting my kids work out
their conflicts themselves

16:30.120 --> 16:32.122
made the fighting even worse.

16:32.122 --> 16:33.493
Your advice was terrible.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.496
Would you like some more?
Oh, sure!

16:36.496 --> 16:38.598
Well, what finally brought
my kids together

16:38.598 --> 16:40.500
was when we got them a dog.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.673
If your kids are responsible
enough, I recommend it.

16:43.673 --> 16:45.935
I gotta tell you,
Stan is the best thing

16:45.935 --> 16:47.337
that ever happened
to this family.

16:47.337 --> 16:50.110
Hearing you say
that means so much to me.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.743
Tonight I am gonna curl up
and sleep at your feet...

16:53.743 --> 16:58.048
is what I would say if I were
your gentleman's valet.

16:58.048 --> 16:59.919
What?
Gotta go.

17:06.056 --> 17:08.027
What is all this?

17:08.027 --> 17:09.999
You don't want to drive
because you don't want to fail

17:09.999 --> 17:11.461
in front of other people.

17:11.461 --> 17:12.902
So I've built you...

17:12.902 --> 17:15.465
(dramatic)
the Gauntlet of Failure!

17:15.465 --> 17:16.536
The gauntlet of failure?

17:16.536 --> 17:20.140
No,
the Gauntlet of Failure!

17:20.140 --> 17:21.741
I'm going to make you
comfortable with failing

17:21.741 --> 17:24.043
in front of other people.
Come on in, everybody.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.276
That's right, get your
soup and take a seat.

17:27.577 --> 17:30.620
Ooh, it's hot.
Smells like celery.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.252
Like Dorothy.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.858
Okay, Avery, let's start
with this basketball hoop.

17:39.989 --> 17:41.661
Dunk the ball.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.564
You think I'm going to fail,
but I don't fail.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.865
I'm gonna do this, Tyler.

17:47.397 --> 17:49.038
I am gonna dunk
this basketball.

18:11.761 --> 18:15.595
Oh, man, I just blew it in
front of all these people.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.926
This is so embarrassing.

18:16.926 --> 18:19.469
Okay, it's not
the end of the world.

18:19.469 --> 18:20.830
You failed in front of people.

18:20.830 --> 18:21.901
Big deal.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.603
We are all focused on our soup.

18:26.075 --> 18:27.807
Now fail at the rest
of these things.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.482
Okay.
I guess I can give it a try.

18:57.066 --> 18:59.609
( cheering )

19:01.911 --> 19:04.574
Yes! I did it!

19:04.574 --> 19:07.116
Failing in front
of people isn't so bad.

19:07.116 --> 19:09.549
Congratulations!
You're a failure!

19:09.549 --> 19:11.751
Now you're ready to drive in
the Greater Los Angeles area.

19:13.583 --> 19:15.425
And you also helped out
Jimbo here.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.627
He was afraid of success.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.641
Chloe, what are you doing?

19:31.641 --> 19:32.742
I'm the cook
in the family.

19:32.742 --> 19:34.644
But I'm the cook
in the family.

19:34.644 --> 19:36.876
Hear her out, hon.

19:36.876 --> 19:40.950
I just made my special chicken
stuffed with Chinese food.

19:40.950 --> 19:43.953
The secret ingredient
is Chinese food.

19:45.615 --> 19:47.487
I think Chloe
is acting like this

19:47.487 --> 19:49.219
because she overheard you say

19:49.219 --> 19:51.421
that she's not your
little cute one anymore.

19:51.421 --> 19:53.863
She's trying to figure out
what makes her special
in the family.

19:53.863 --> 19:57.166
No, I didn't mean that.
I've got to talk to her.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.928
Although, she could
be the strong one.

19:58.928 --> 20:00.670
That rock was
not light, Bennett.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.532
Jacked me up.

20:02.532 --> 20:03.973
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:03.973 --> 20:06.135
Why is that colander moving?

20:06.135 --> 20:08.408
That's my line cook,
Francois.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.512
Aaah!
Put a coat on it!

20:13.613 --> 20:16.085
I'm gonna let you two talk.

20:16.085 --> 20:19.449
Chloe, why don't I take
care of that for you?

20:20.590 --> 20:22.922
It's like a skin potato!

20:24.654 --> 20:26.456
Sweetie, come here.

20:28.298 --> 20:29.729
Did you overhear me say

20:29.729 --> 20:32.231
you weren't the little
cute one anymore?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.534
I guess so.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.906
Oh, honey, it's okay
that you're growing up.

20:36.906 --> 20:39.269
I don't want you
to feel badly about that.

20:39.269 --> 20:42.572
But it made you sad
when I called you "Mom."

20:42.572 --> 20:46.316
I'm sorry. I didn't
handle that very well.

20:46.316 --> 20:48.678
But I think I know why.

20:48.678 --> 20:51.721
When your dad and I first got
together and I first met you,

20:51.721 --> 20:54.484
I'd already missed out on
years of being your mommy,

20:54.484 --> 20:56.686
and I didn't want
that to go away yet.

20:56.686 --> 20:59.489
But I'm really glad I get
to be your Mom now.

20:59.489 --> 21:02.061
You are?
Oh, yeah, honey.

21:02.061 --> 21:06.366
You're such a wonderful girl.
That'll always make you
special in this family.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.197
I love you so much.

21:08.197 --> 21:10.640
Love you, too, Mom.

21:12.101 --> 21:15.575
Here, try my special
gummy worm lasagna.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.878
Oh. What made you think
to combine those ingredients?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.680
Oh, they're just things I found
around the kitchen.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.552
Lasagna, gum, and worms.

21:24.654 --> 21:26.716
If I had taken a bite, that
would have been a spit take.

21:26.716 --> 21:27.487
Like this.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.561
Why did I do that?

21:33.563 --> 21:36.726
I'll get Francois
to help me clean this up.

21:36.726 --> 21:40.530
Francois, you got time to lean,
you got time to clean!

21:42.572 --> 21:44.534
Yes, I did it!

21:44.534 --> 21:46.836
I went driving
with Tyler and Mr. Trummer

21:46.836 --> 21:49.339
and I didn't mind failing
in front of people.

21:49.339 --> 21:51.110
Not when I went up
on that curb,

21:51.110 --> 21:53.282
not when I drove
through that flower bed.

21:53.282 --> 21:55.144
Not even when
I hit that mailbox.

21:55.144 --> 21:57.286
Our mailbox.
We need a new mailbox.

21:58.287 --> 21:59.789
Proud of you, sweetie.

21:59.789 --> 22:02.151
I am totally putting
this in her bed tonight.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.726
Proud of you, sweetie.

22:06.726 --> 22:10.129
STAN:
So I took Bennett's advice
and got my pups a pet

22:10.129 --> 22:11.661
to bring them together.

22:11.661 --> 22:13.132
I couldn't trust
them to take care

22:13.132 --> 22:14.634
of a real hairless guinea pig,

22:14.634 --> 22:16.806
so I got them
the next best thing.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.875
Aghh! It's weird-looking!

22:25.875 --> 22:28.518
Ohh! Put a coat on it!

22:30.049 --> 22:32.281
