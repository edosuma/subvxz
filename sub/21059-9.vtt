01:27.149 --> 01:28.949
You're beautiful.

01:48.838 --> 01:50.204
And you're mine.

02:01.918 --> 02:03.717
Mine.

02:16.565 --> 02:18.132
<i>Mornin'.</i>

02:18.167 --> 02:20.267
How are we today?

02:21.337 --> 02:24.271
We are a little unsettled.

02:24.307 --> 02:27.074
I had a terrible dream about Benedict.

02:27.900 --> 02:29.310
Oh, it was just a dream.

02:30.613 --> 02:32.765
Nothing to worry yourself about.

02:33.983 --> 02:36.150
I can't help thinking it's a sign

02:36.175 --> 02:38.519
of darker things to come.

02:42.725 --> 02:44.525
This'll fix you right up.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.233
Thank you.

02:55.271 --> 02:57.604
Peggy! What's wrong?

02:57.640 --> 02:59.173
Peggy!

03:00.643 --> 03:03.243
<i>Peggy!</i>

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

03:56.061 --> 03:57.827
Heard you been looking
for a British soldier

03:57.862 --> 03:59.629
- claiming to be a spy.
- Aye.

03:59.664 --> 04:02.098
We nabbed this scrappy
bastard near Blandford.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.067
Claims he was planted
with the lobsters in York City

04:04.102 --> 04:05.601
on Washington's orders.

04:06.052 --> 04:07.670
Bring him out.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.245
Brewster?

04:17.855 --> 04:18.981
Champe.

04:19.017 --> 04:21.951
<i>- This your man?</i>
- No.

04:21.986 --> 04:24.487
- Wait, wait, wait...
- But he's telling the truth.

04:25.738 --> 04:26.956
He's one of ours.

04:32.163 --> 04:33.788
What happened to Woodhull?

04:34.299 --> 04:36.541
Last I saw him, he was looking
for a way to run.

04:37.869 --> 04:39.135
Hopefully, he got another chance.

04:39.170 --> 04:41.104
I thought I glimpsed him at Blandford.

04:41.139 --> 04:42.405
He can't have gotten too far.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.873
Our plan was get to Head of Elk.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.074
We heard Lafayette was there.

04:45.110 --> 04:46.876
- Lafayette?
- Aye.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.344
Frenchies have a sloop
further up the coast.

04:48.379 --> 04:50.947
- They're always patrolling.
- Good man.

05:03.328 --> 05:04.794
Bon appétit.

05:11.836 --> 05:14.670
First time locked in the brig?

05:16.040 --> 05:17.039
Third.

05:18.176 --> 05:20.843
Was it sins or mistakes?

05:33.825 --> 05:35.091
I was summoned.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.627
As were we.

05:46.404 --> 05:48.337
I've written Robert Morris

05:48.373 --> 05:51.783
requesting 30 transport vessels
to move the army.

05:52.243 --> 05:55.344
I require of you our count
of wagons, tent, and horse,

05:55.380 --> 05:57.814
as well as smaller boats
to lay pontoons.

05:57.849 --> 06:00.183
For amphibious assault
on New York Harbor.

06:00.218 --> 06:03.795
No. The vessels are for moving south

06:04.355 --> 06:05.880
to Virginia,

06:06.558 --> 06:09.025
where we will rendezvous
with the French fleet

06:09.060 --> 06:10.526
under Admiral De Grasse.

06:10.562 --> 06:12.795
The pontoons are for the benefit
of General Clinton,

06:12.831 --> 06:15.665
to make him think that
we're attacking New York.

06:16.224 --> 06:20.036
Sir, may... may I ask what
prompted this change of course?

06:20.071 --> 06:22.572
Lafayette received intelligence
from a trusted source

06:22.607 --> 06:25.074
<i>in the enemy's camp
that General Cornwallis</i>

06:25.109 --> 06:26.909
is vulnerable in Yorktown.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.747
We will need to conceal
our true destination

06:31.783 --> 06:34.016
from our own men as well.

06:34.052 --> 06:36.252
Until we reach the Delaware,

06:36.287 --> 06:39.255
they will think that we are
embarking for Staten Island.

06:39.290 --> 06:42.258
Keeping our men in the dark
won't be the problem, sir.

06:42.293 --> 06:44.377
Deceiving Clinton will be.

06:44.762 --> 06:46.495
I can take a regiment to Rhode Island.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.064
They will think we are
mustering with the French

06:48.099 --> 06:49.632
<i>to attack York City.</i>

06:49.667 --> 06:52.368
Dividing the army will put us
at a disadvantage.

06:52.403 --> 06:54.203
<i>Sir, the numbers
clearly favor the enemy.</i>

06:54.239 --> 06:56.272
We need every man we've got.

06:56.307 --> 06:59.108
You'd do well not to dismiss
a proposal out of hand

06:59.143 --> 07:00.509
unless you've a better one.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.602
I do.

07:02.347 --> 07:04.480
I believe I have a way
to convince General Clinton

07:04.515 --> 07:06.182
that we intend to attack New York,

07:06.217 --> 07:10.219
and we don't need to move
a single man to do it.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.260
Maybe Clinton will call
troops from Virginia

07:17.295 --> 07:18.728
to fortify the city.

07:18.763 --> 07:21.664
- If he believes the letter...
- He will.

07:22.100 --> 07:25.209
What did you write in it
that was so compelling?

07:26.437 --> 07:29.972
Oh, it's, uh... nothing of importance.

07:30.008 --> 07:31.807
Then why the secrecy?

07:32.300 --> 07:36.379
Well, if you must know,
it's a, uh, love letter.

07:37.096 --> 07:38.781
From?

07:39.223 --> 07:41.250
From me...

07:41.286 --> 07:43.152
to you.

07:44.622 --> 07:46.389
You said yourself there was gossip.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.108
I merely wrote to what Ann
Bates already believed.

07:51.562 --> 07:54.363
Well, now you have to tell me something.

07:54.699 --> 07:57.099
You don't have much experience
with love letters.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.663
Are you sure it's convincing?

08:03.841 --> 08:05.741
Convincing enough.

08:12.350 --> 08:15.785
Are you sure Mrs. Strong
doesn't know you took this?

08:15.820 --> 08:17.620
I was able to sneak it
out of her belongings

08:17.655 --> 08:18.888
without her noticing.

08:19.557 --> 08:21.524
Who'd have known young Major Tallmadge

08:21.559 --> 08:23.693
had such a way with words?

08:23.728 --> 08:25.594
Especially the ones where he says

08:25.630 --> 08:27.663
he'll miss his little cart wench

08:27.699 --> 08:30.366
while the army's off to take York City.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.373
What are you doing?

08:37.408 --> 08:39.976
Taking this to Sir Henry.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.680
It's not too late
for you to come with me.

08:44.716 --> 08:48.150
It's best if I stay,
if only to ensure that...

08:48.186 --> 08:50.219
that no one comes looking for you.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.757
What aren't you telling me?

08:54.792 --> 08:56.459
I've told you everything that I know.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.895
Except the real reason
you want to stay behind.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.166
Anna Strong.

09:05.303 --> 09:07.478
She's done awful things to me.

09:08.139 --> 09:11.007
I don't forgive easily,
and I won't leave this camp

09:11.042 --> 09:12.900
until I see she gets
what's coming to her.

09:14.527 --> 09:16.570
Well, Mary,

09:16.848 --> 09:19.982
remind me to always stay
on your good side.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.887
Give my regards to your Joseph.

09:24.922 --> 09:26.489
Take care of yourself.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.224
And little Thomas.

09:44.108 --> 09:45.708
What's wrong?

09:45.743 --> 09:46.934
Nothing.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.779
Doctor says you're fine
and so is the baby.

09:49.814 --> 09:51.939
<i>If</i> you stay off your feet.

09:52.850 --> 09:54.358
Do you believe him?

09:55.651 --> 09:57.862
I can tell you're worried
about something.

09:58.256 --> 10:01.365
I've heard tell a bounty's been
placed on General Arnold's life

10:01.826 --> 10:03.826
by the Virginia Governor, Jefferson.

10:04.996 --> 10:06.862
They're gossiping 'bout it
down at the market.

10:06.898 --> 10:10.099
I fear someone's bound
to take a shot at him.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.751
I hope someone does.

10:12.837 --> 10:15.304
Then I'll be rid of him
once and for all.

10:17.742 --> 10:21.110
If I'm honest, it's what
he said about John.

10:23.848 --> 10:26.348
That he still loved me, even at the end.

10:28.186 --> 10:30.561
Major André always loved you.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.982
It broke his heart for you
to be with someone else.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.594
He wanted you more than he ever
wanted to turn General Arnold.

10:38.629 --> 10:40.062
Remember that.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.934
It's probably the delivery
from the market.

10:44.969 --> 10:46.569
I'll see to it.

11:01.886 --> 11:04.120
I told you I was coming back.

11:23.407 --> 11:25.474
I'm sorry I took so long.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.476
But I did come back here in spring...

11:27.512 --> 11:30.446
- I know.
- And y-you weren't here.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.981
And I had to get outta town.

11:32.016 --> 11:33.582
And then Rangers ambushed you,

11:33.618 --> 11:37.169
and you ran off with ã500
of army gold, I know.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.088
How?

11:39.123 --> 11:41.423
Woodhull told me. The son.

11:41.459 --> 11:43.676
Said you saved his life out there.

11:44.552 --> 11:45.845
Y-yeah.

11:46.631 --> 11:49.098
I-I-I didn't mean for this to happen.

11:49.133 --> 11:52.201
- I know.
- Would you stop with that, now?

11:52.236 --> 11:55.271
Listen, go get your
clothes, get that boy.

11:55.306 --> 11:57.907
I'm gonna show you both
someplace you don't know.

11:57.942 --> 12:02.011
It's cold, but it's so beautiful.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.283
Cicero's not here.

12:07.652 --> 12:09.552
He's with General Arnold.

12:09.587 --> 12:11.287
Signed on as his valet.

12:11.722 --> 12:13.822
They're marching somewhere
between here and Virginia.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.724
<i>Abigail?</i>

12:15.760 --> 12:18.427
Mrs. Arnold, she's about to give birth.

12:18.878 --> 12:20.930
I'm sorry.

12:20.965 --> 12:22.598
I'm gonna find him.

12:23.048 --> 12:24.567
No.

12:24.602 --> 12:27.928
I <i> can</i> find him.

12:28.839 --> 12:31.207
- Akinbode...
- I know.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.128
<i>Abigail!</i>

12:54.732 --> 12:57.499
<i>He fears he may never see her again.</i>

13:01.872 --> 13:05.908
When he wrote that an attack of this
size has never been tried before,

13:05.943 --> 13:08.244
<i>I knew I had to get this
to you at once, sir.</i>

13:08.279 --> 13:10.471
You were absolutely right, madam.

13:11.182 --> 13:15.100
Who did you say procured
this intelligence?

13:15.753 --> 13:19.021
In camp, she went by Mary Smith.

13:19.056 --> 13:22.458
But her true name
is Woodhull, wife to...

13:22.493 --> 13:24.226
Abraham Woodhull.

13:24.262 --> 13:28.197
Yes. You... you know him?

13:28.232 --> 13:31.433
<i>One of them refuses
easy money so that he may fight,</i>

13:31.469 --> 13:34.403
the other endangers herself
to spy on our behalf.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.206
If only we had more colonists
like the Woodhulls.

13:37.241 --> 13:38.407
And the Bateses.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.342
<i>You've done very well, madam.</i>

13:40.378 --> 13:43.445
As reward for your efforts,
I've arranged a little visit.

13:49.387 --> 13:50.853
As you were.

13:50.888 --> 13:52.388
Joseph.

13:53.190 --> 13:54.957
My little scout.

13:56.093 --> 13:57.393
Your wife has been exemplary

13:57.428 --> 13:59.603
in service of the Crown, Corporal.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.898
Be sure to thank her properly for us.

14:03.399 --> 14:05.467
Oh, Joseph.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.910
Sir, I... I don't know if we
should trust this intelligence,

14:14.945 --> 14:17.279
seeing as it arrives
from an unverified source.

14:17.315 --> 14:20.382
Mrs. Bates infiltrated
the camp at White Plains

14:20.418 --> 14:22.017
before New Windsor.

14:22.053 --> 14:24.820
<i>You know, she's verified in my book.</i>

14:24.855 --> 14:27.489
And Washington's been itching
to retake New York

14:27.525 --> 14:30.392
ever since Howe sent him
fleeing into Harlem.

14:30.428 --> 14:32.895
Still, sir, I must urge caution.

14:32.930 --> 14:35.264
And caution is what I intend to take.

14:36.348 --> 14:39.368
<i>It will require recalling
some forces from Cornwallis.</i>

14:39.977 --> 14:41.904
He won't take kindly to that,

14:41.939 --> 14:43.472
what with Arnold returning north

14:43.507 --> 14:45.774
<i>and a loss in the Ranger leadership.</i>

14:45.810 --> 14:47.476
Loss in the Rangers?

14:47.511 --> 14:50.279
<i>Colonel Simcoe's gravely ill
after being wounded in battle.</i>

14:50.314 --> 14:52.348
<i>At death's door, apparently.</i>

14:52.383 --> 14:54.983
Still, Charlie will have to make do.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.886
We must protect New York.

14:57.922 --> 14:59.538
Sir?

15:00.291 --> 15:02.024
In the interest of security,

15:02.059 --> 15:05.994
may I ask that I personally
deliver your orders to Yorktown?

15:06.030 --> 15:07.563
Certainly.

15:16.867 --> 15:18.634
<i>Allons-y.</i>

15:21.020 --> 15:22.353
What's going on?

15:32.407 --> 15:33.931
It ain't him.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.567
- Shut up.
- Definitely ain't him.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.836
You bastard.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.599
I told you I was telling
the truth, didn't I?

15:40.624 --> 15:41.610
Come here. With so much at stake,

15:41.645 --> 15:43.574
every precaution had to be taken.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.587
- You all right?
- How are ya?

15:46.112 --> 15:47.214
All right.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.380
I saw you at Blandford.

15:50.276 --> 15:52.443
Was that you who shot Simcoe?

15:52.518 --> 15:55.030
Aye. Did I kill him?

15:55.030 --> 15:56.996
Ah, well, the last I saw,
he was still drawing breath.

15:57.032 --> 15:59.198
Might have had a chance myself,
but it was either that

15:59.234 --> 16:02.268
or making sure the British
plans got to Washington.

16:02.771 --> 16:05.538
- You did send the letter, right?
- What letter?

16:06.567 --> 16:08.241
I received word that His Excellency

16:08.276 --> 16:09.942
has left New York and is moving south

16:09.978 --> 16:11.744
with his army and ours.

16:11.780 --> 16:13.846
I have orders to sail to support him.

16:14.749 --> 16:16.149
Where are we meeting him?

16:17.752 --> 16:19.118
Yorktown.

16:31.466 --> 16:34.534
<i>The general has
received your fervent requests</i>

16:34.569 --> 16:36.035
for more men, but unfortunately,

16:36.071 --> 16:38.004
he cannot allocate them at this time.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.506
In fact, it is he who needs men

16:40.542 --> 16:42.342
<i>from your battalions immediately</i>

16:42.377 --> 16:43.776
<i>for another campaign.</i>

16:43.812 --> 16:46.112
- Another campaign?
- Where?

16:46.147 --> 16:47.280
York City.

16:47.315 --> 16:49.115
Washington is planning to attack,

16:49.150 --> 16:50.717
<i>and General Clinton needs all the men</i>

16:50.752 --> 16:52.618
that you can spare to defend the harbor.

16:52.654 --> 16:54.754
That's not what our scouts report.

16:54.789 --> 16:56.222
Mm.

16:57.859 --> 17:00.760
Let the general know we will
send reserves tomorrow.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.798
You may take your leave
whenever you choose.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.067
Uh, General, one more thing.

17:08.103 --> 17:09.769
Would you permit me
to take notes on the camp

17:09.804 --> 17:11.604
for my report to General Clinton?

17:12.049 --> 17:13.638
The camp is at your disposal.

17:13.675 --> 17:15.141
Thank you.

17:32.026 --> 17:35.280
The wound is festering.
Your blood is tainted.

17:35.797 --> 17:37.663
You've been bled to purge it,
but you're still not healing

17:37.699 --> 17:39.499
as well or as fast as I'd like.

17:39.534 --> 17:40.800
Recourse?

17:40.835 --> 17:42.869
Prayer. That's all there is now.

17:42.904 --> 17:44.771
I can send for the chaplain.

17:44.806 --> 17:46.083
Don't.

17:46.541 --> 17:49.211
Colonel, if you have any loved ones,

17:50.011 --> 17:51.755
you should write to them.

17:52.714 --> 17:54.447
Get your affairs in order.

18:05.668 --> 18:09.061
_

18:09.497 --> 18:12.698
I must find Comte Rochambeau
and give him my report.

18:12.734 --> 18:14.300
Till we meet again.

18:21.242 --> 18:22.619
Is that Thomas?

18:23.511 --> 18:24.977
Thomas!

18:30.002 --> 18:32.018
Either you're getting quick
or I'm getting slow!

18:32.053 --> 18:34.454
Come here, ah! Got you!
Let me look at you!

18:34.489 --> 18:35.855
<i>Abraham?</i>

18:37.225 --> 18:38.391
Hi.

18:38.426 --> 18:41.227
- Abraham.
- Hi. Are you all right?

18:43.164 --> 18:44.897
You made it back in one piece.

18:46.367 --> 18:49.502
Not for lack of trying.

18:49.537 --> 18:51.838
I knew you'd find him.

18:51.873 --> 18:54.140
Never doubted it for a moment.

18:55.610 --> 18:58.322
Well, there's no hiding you now, eh?

18:58.813 --> 19:00.580
So much for Samuel Culper, eh?

19:00.615 --> 19:03.349
Well, I never liked him anyway.

19:04.819 --> 19:06.819
Well, whenever you're ready.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.355
Yeah, just give me
a moment with my wife?

19:09.390 --> 19:12.925
- Of course.
- All right. Good to see you.

19:12.961 --> 19:15.361
All right?

19:15.396 --> 19:17.230
I missed you so much.

19:21.202 --> 19:23.889
You shouldn't be here, nor him.

19:24.672 --> 19:27.017
- It's closer to you...
- It's too close to the fighting.

19:27.675 --> 19:29.575
All right? I want you to take
Thomas, gather your things,

19:29.611 --> 19:31.438
and I'll have Ben arrange for a boat.

19:32.313 --> 19:34.587
A boat? To where?

19:34.622 --> 19:36.616
Back to Setauket.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.386
What about you?

19:42.757 --> 19:44.557
I'm staying here.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.359
I'm not leaving without you.

19:46.394 --> 19:50.196
Washington moved the army based
on intelligence that I sent.

19:50.665 --> 19:52.965
I'm here and I know how to fight.

19:53.001 --> 19:54.252
I...

19:54.903 --> 19:56.802
I can't abandon the cause now.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.177
You're my cause, Abraham.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.545
I won't abandon you either.

20:08.266 --> 20:10.583
We've come too far to go back now.

20:13.522 --> 20:15.454
<i>7,000 casks of rice,</i>

20:15.490 --> 20:18.543
10,000 pounds of salted
beef and pork for the men.

20:18.578 --> 20:20.726
<i>A hundred tons of hay and
oats to feed their horses,</i>

20:20.762 --> 20:23.195
<i>though some of that went with
Arnold when he marched north.</i>

20:23.231 --> 20:26.198
He dumped a cache of black
powder into the James

20:26.234 --> 20:28.917
<i>to make room for the tobacco
that he plans to sell.</i>

20:29.311 --> 20:30.703
So munitions are low.

20:30.738 --> 20:32.371
<i>Enough for the cannons, though.</i>

20:32.407 --> 20:34.173
They have 140 of those on the ground.

20:34.208 --> 20:37.276
140, right.

20:37.312 --> 20:39.612
And? Anything else?

20:39.647 --> 20:41.514
He's right as rain and ready to fight.

20:41.549 --> 20:43.749
You just tell us where you want us.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.218
<i>We will seize the entrenchment defenses</i>

20:46.254 --> 20:50.189
<i>abandoned by the enemy
near the Pigeon's Quarter.</i>

20:54.395 --> 20:56.395
Once reinforced,
we will convert the battery

20:56.431 --> 21:00.066
and continue entrenching, using
them as cover for our advance.

21:00.101 --> 21:01.834
We will then dig two parallels

21:01.869 --> 21:03.936
<i>until we reach our main targets...</i>

21:03.972 --> 21:05.671
<i>Redoubts 9 and 10.</i>

21:08.476 --> 21:11.243
<i>First, we must get
through the Fusiliers redoubt</i>

21:11.279 --> 21:12.244
<i>on the perimeter.</i>

21:12.280 --> 21:13.879
<i>It's heavily fortified.</i>

21:14.249 --> 21:18.384
If the first redoubt falls,
the rest will follow.

21:21.556 --> 21:22.955
Admiral de Grasse is maneuvering

21:22.991 --> 21:24.790
24 of our ships
of the line into position.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.459
Colonel Olney has arrived.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.028
The Rhode Island Regiment
is at our disposal.

21:29.063 --> 21:31.364
Good, as we advance, my hope

21:31.399 --> 21:34.686
is that our friends in the
water will provide cover.

21:35.303 --> 21:37.637
Major, have the men begin reinforcing

21:37.672 --> 21:39.572
- the enemy's works at once.
- Yes, sir.

21:39.607 --> 21:41.140
Come on, get out there, men!

21:41.175 --> 21:44.043
They can't target us at night. Come on!

21:44.078 --> 21:47.513
They're firing blind!
Do not be intimidated!

22:07.769 --> 22:09.201
General.

22:10.571 --> 22:12.271
Come on!

22:34.075 --> 22:37.510
How did you become
so well-versed in John's plans?

22:38.236 --> 22:40.546
I don't understand what you mean.

22:40.582 --> 22:42.181
It's a simple question.

22:44.019 --> 22:45.918
I can't imagine he would
be sharing his plans

22:45.954 --> 22:48.986
to turn Benedict Arnold
over dinner with his servant.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.958
You're twisting my words.

22:51.993 --> 22:53.157
Am I?

22:54.362 --> 22:56.996
Or are you twisting away from the truth?

22:59.034 --> 23:01.401
You told me the rebels
turned you against Benedict

23:01.436 --> 23:03.000
when you were in their camp,

23:03.838 --> 23:06.546
but it started much earlier
than that, didn't it?

23:07.672 --> 23:09.342
Stop.

23:09.377 --> 23:11.310
<i>You're upsetting yourself.</i>

23:11.634 --> 23:13.312
It's not good for you or the baby.

23:13.348 --> 23:17.683
Before conspiring against my husband...

23:20.555 --> 23:23.856
you were spying against John
for the Patriots.

23:26.428 --> 23:29.729
Benedict said Tallmadge was a
step ahead of him at West Point,

23:29.764 --> 23:32.198
and that's how they caught John.

23:33.701 --> 23:36.402
<i>You</i> are the reason he's dead!

23:36.438 --> 23:38.037
No.

23:38.073 --> 23:40.246
I never meant for him to be hurt.

23:41.076 --> 23:43.242
I only warned them about
the General Arnold's betrayal.

23:43.278 --> 23:44.959
You shut your mouth.

23:45.513 --> 23:47.914
Send for the doctor
and leave this house at once.

23:47.949 --> 23:51.551
- Peggy...
- No, don't you dare speak my name!

23:51.586 --> 23:53.486
Get out! Now!

23:57.725 --> 24:00.893
Leave before I force you out myself.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.097
You're bleeding.

24:05.266 --> 24:08.134
- Baby's coming.
- Oh, no.

24:08.169 --> 24:09.569
No, it's too soon.

24:30.625 --> 24:32.225
Get down!

24:35.263 --> 24:36.562
Fall back!

24:38.299 --> 24:41.100
Aah!

24:48.710 --> 24:50.576
Bring broadside to bear.

24:50.612 --> 24:51.944
Adjust for wind and tides

24:51.980 --> 24:53.913
and set sights for the enemy lines.

25:12.167 --> 25:15.168
_

25:17.410 --> 25:20.972
_

25:22.437 --> 25:23.776
_

25:23.811 --> 25:25.545
Line ahead!

25:25.580 --> 25:28.447
Signal the fleet
to clear the field for fire!

25:47.335 --> 25:49.202
Bear down and engage!

25:49.237 --> 25:50.803
Angle starboard!

25:57.812 --> 25:59.478
What the hell is he doing?

25:59.514 --> 26:01.681
He's not following the signal.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.487
Why signal one way and move the other?

26:08.523 --> 26:09.889
Belay that order!

26:09.924 --> 26:12.358
Rake broadsides, fire as she bears!

26:13.795 --> 26:16.562
_

26:22.870 --> 26:26.005
<i>Keep digging those trenches.</i>

26:36.951 --> 26:39.118
<i> Fire!</i>

26:39.153 --> 26:42.955
<i>Second line, advance! Fire!</i>

26:57.138 --> 26:58.971
Anyone need water?

27:00.241 --> 27:01.407
<i>Water?</i>

27:11.819 --> 27:14.787
The red bastards set up shop right
in my goddamn drawing room!

27:14.822 --> 27:17.823
Five guineas to any man who
puts a ball through my house

27:17.859 --> 27:20.259
cellar to chimney!

27:20.295 --> 27:23.462
Your coin's welcome
in my pockets, Nelson!

27:29.504 --> 27:30.603
Missed.

27:40.315 --> 27:43.115
Adjust for shorter range!

27:44.452 --> 27:46.585
<i>Cannon set! We're ready, sir!</i>

27:46.621 --> 27:47.920
Fire!

27:47.955 --> 27:49.455
<i>Move over, boatman.</i>

27:49.490 --> 27:52.391
Let me show you
how the real shooting's done.

27:52.427 --> 27:54.260
Aah!

27:54.295 --> 27:56.362
Molly! Pitcher!

28:02.236 --> 28:05.037
Just a minute, love. I need a drink.

28:28.129 --> 28:32.131
Get him up! Get him up!

28:32.166 --> 28:33.532
Move!

28:38.363 --> 28:40.798
Moving helps with the pain.

28:42.969 --> 28:45.770
I can't. I have to rest.

28:54.747 --> 28:55.913
What is it?

28:55.948 --> 28:58.482
Baby's not turned right.

28:58.856 --> 29:01.519
Y-you need to go for the doctor.

29:01.554 --> 29:03.187
No time.

29:03.233 --> 29:04.900
It's best for both of you if I stay.

29:04.935 --> 29:07.090
No. No.

29:07.671 --> 29:09.438
- I can't.
- You can.

29:12.276 --> 29:15.076
Cicero tried to come
into this world upside down.

29:15.112 --> 29:17.746
A midwife helped me guide him
out during my reckoning,

29:17.781 --> 29:19.748
and she taught me to do the same.

29:19.783 --> 29:22.451
But I need you to trust me.

29:25.289 --> 29:28.028
Help!! I need help!

29:28.692 --> 29:30.926
Hang in there, Woody.

29:30.961 --> 29:33.428
You! Here! Now!

29:45.142 --> 29:47.209
Am I dead?

30:00.858 --> 30:02.791
<i>I want water!</i>

30:10.701 --> 30:12.868
Thomas, I told you to wait outside.

30:12.903 --> 30:15.670
- Papa's here.
- No, Papa's not...

30:18.308 --> 30:20.242
Abe? Abraham?

30:20.277 --> 30:22.277
Oh, God. No.

30:22.312 --> 30:24.646
M-Mary. Mary.

30:24.681 --> 30:27.215
Abe, this is going to hurt.

30:32.756 --> 30:34.956
I need to stop the bleeding.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.568
Your face... I forgot
how beautiful it was.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.740
Try not to talk.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.283
<i>Simcoe's in here.</i>

31:48.026 --> 31:49.264
Sir?

31:53.904 --> 31:55.837
You wanted to see us, sir?

32:11.675 --> 32:15.156
General Cornwallis has informed me

32:15.192 --> 32:19.494
that the safety of this place
is so precarious,

32:19.530 --> 32:24.065
he cannot recommend our
rescue to General Clinton.

32:26.370 --> 32:30.405
<i>Many of you, before you came to me,</i>

32:30.440 --> 32:32.529
<i>before you came to Rogers,</i>

32:33.110 --> 32:35.510
<i>had enlisted with the rebel militia</i>

32:35.546 --> 32:37.679
<i>or the Continental Army.</i>

32:40.286 --> 32:43.289
<i>I recommend that you flee...</i>

32:44.454 --> 32:49.591
<i>and rejoin your former units
if the opportunity arises.</i>

32:49.921 --> 32:53.828
Your excuse should be that you
were captured by the British

32:53.864 --> 32:57.332
and you were biding time
to make your escape.

32:58.969 --> 33:03.768
Otherwise, they will
execute every one of you.

33:04.644 --> 33:06.541
<i>We can't leave you behind.</i>

33:06.980 --> 33:09.477
<i>I will ship out on the Bonetta</i>

33:09.513 --> 33:12.714
with the other ranking
officers that have fallen ill.

33:13.361 --> 33:15.530
The French will allow her
through the blockade?

33:16.053 --> 33:18.658
Washington will convince them.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.089
He's a man of honor.

33:22.793 --> 33:24.025
Go.

33:25.929 --> 33:27.963
While you still can.

33:38.508 --> 33:40.575
While Deux-Ponts advances on Redoubt 9,

33:40.611 --> 33:44.679
I advance on 10 with bayonets
fixed and muskets unloaded.

33:44.715 --> 33:46.548
And the forlorn hope of 20 men.

33:46.583 --> 33:48.016
With your company in reserve,

33:48.051 --> 33:49.584
we can end this tonight,<i> mon ami.</i>

33:49.620 --> 33:52.554
<i>Non!</i> This is folly, my friend.

33:52.589 --> 33:54.589
Laurens' men were torn apart
by the enemy fougasse.

33:54.625 --> 33:57.425
We can expect many more such mortars
embedded around their redoubts.

33:57.461 --> 33:59.227
They will not hear us coming.

33:59.262 --> 34:01.396
<i>They will not have time
to light the fuses.</i>

34:01.431 --> 34:04.299
<i>Your Excellency, we'll wait them out.</i>

34:04.334 --> 34:06.668
We let our Grand Battery
shell them from the field

34:06.703 --> 34:09.504
and our ships shell them
from the sea until they break.

34:09.539 --> 34:12.407
And how long do we wait?
What if reinforcements arrive?

34:12.442 --> 34:14.074
They don't have enough powder.

34:15.779 --> 34:17.679
For their mines.
For the... the fougasse.

34:17.714 --> 34:19.214
They may have made
a show of it at the start,

34:19.248 --> 34:20.482
but they're running on reserves.

34:20.516 --> 34:22.417
- How do you know this?
- Culper.

34:22.972 --> 34:24.052
<i>While in the enemy camp,</i>

34:24.087 --> 34:26.420
he observed their black
powder was running low,

34:26.456 --> 34:29.157
enough for a march, but not for a siege.

34:29.232 --> 34:31.866
They'll save what they have
left for cannons, not mines.

34:33.603 --> 34:37.472
Now or never, deliverance must come.

34:37.507 --> 34:40.007
We attack the redoubts at nightfall.

34:41.777 --> 34:44.679
Okay, I've got the baby turned around.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.415
Now I need you to do the rest.

34:47.451 --> 34:48.516
Push!

34:50.554 --> 34:53.054
Push! Push.

34:54.224 --> 34:56.858
Charge!

35:07.971 --> 35:09.270
Come on!

35:53.450 --> 35:55.383
Take their cannons!

36:13.537 --> 36:16.070
Turn the guns on the town!

36:24.414 --> 36:27.282
- Out of the way!
- Ready!

36:27.317 --> 36:30.018
And... fire!

36:32.322 --> 36:34.255
Get to the shore!

37:11.609 --> 37:13.142
I'm going to the galley, sir.

37:13.178 --> 37:15.211
Let me know if you need anything.

37:41.773 --> 37:45.708
It was wise of you to come

37:45.744 --> 37:47.944
while I was weakened.

37:55.153 --> 37:57.320
I had a horse once.

37:57.355 --> 37:58.688
Bucephalus.

37:58.723 --> 38:00.214
You may recall him.

38:00.859 --> 38:02.258
Andalusian.

38:02.293 --> 38:05.511
Powerful, noble, trustworthy.

38:06.231 --> 38:08.097
Beautiful creature.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.900
Brought low...

38:10.935 --> 38:13.136
with a poisoned apple.

38:16.007 --> 38:17.507
Take a bite.

38:20.145 --> 38:21.611
Bite.

38:37.962 --> 38:41.597
Of all the men I have forged

38:41.633 --> 38:45.234
from weaklings into warriors...

38:46.838 --> 38:52.074
you may have been my greatest creation.

38:55.246 --> 38:57.180
How does your treat taste?

38:57.215 --> 38:59.774
It was delicious.

39:00.785 --> 39:02.418
Thank you.

39:03.822 --> 39:06.522
That is what mercy tastes like.

39:10.929 --> 39:12.495
Bittersweet.

39:14.032 --> 39:16.541
I did so want to kill you, John.

39:17.068 --> 39:19.368
I still do, as a point of fact,

39:19.404 --> 39:22.797
but after I heard you
grant mercy to your men,

39:23.608 --> 39:25.775
I had a change of heart.

39:25.810 --> 39:30.680
You have earned the right to destroy me.

39:32.116 --> 39:33.449
Do it.

39:36.588 --> 39:39.021
All nature is a circle...

39:39.457 --> 39:41.858
of creation and destruction.

39:42.894 --> 39:47.280
And after so much destruction
from this war, John,

39:48.166 --> 39:51.267
it is time to tend the garden again.

39:51.302 --> 39:53.769
I have thought long about this.

39:55.139 --> 39:58.082
So, you see, I am not
breaking the circle

39:58.443 --> 40:01.777
but merely following it...

40:01.813 --> 40:05.314
through its natural revolution.

40:05.350 --> 40:08.584
You... are weak.

40:12.991 --> 40:17.393
We must create a new world
from the old world.

40:17.929 --> 40:22.098
And our feud is part of the old.

40:23.735 --> 40:27.370
Such knowledge is bitter.

40:29.574 --> 40:32.408
But the fruit is sweet.

40:54.165 --> 40:57.633
He's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

40:59.904 --> 41:01.837
What will you name him?

41:03.708 --> 41:05.191
Edward.

41:05.677 --> 41:07.318
After my father.

41:08.194 --> 41:10.346
It's a strong name.

41:18.690 --> 41:20.331
It wasn't your fault.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.829
Providence played a
greater hand in our lives

41:26.864 --> 41:28.798
than either of us could ever know.

41:29.334 --> 41:33.302
It brought you into my home,
for better and worse.

41:34.872 --> 41:36.706
But you saved my life.

41:38.376 --> 41:40.209
You saved us both.

41:44.515 --> 41:47.483
Even though I can't help
my own son right now...

41:50.021 --> 41:53.356
I'm glad I could help yours.

42:28.459 --> 42:29.759
"Yankee Doodle."

42:29.794 --> 42:32.428
"Yankee Doodle" playing

42:44.108 --> 42:45.541
Halt!

43:07.298 --> 43:09.432
Is it the habit of General Cornwallis

43:09.467 --> 43:12.535
not to attend an official surrender?

43:12.860 --> 43:15.529
I'm afraid the general has fallen ill.

43:16.074 --> 43:19.008
He sends his deepest apologies.

43:19.043 --> 43:21.610
Nearly four years ago to this day,

43:22.119 --> 43:24.880
<i>General Gates accepted
General Burgoyne's sword</i>

43:24.916 --> 43:26.582
<i>at Saratoga.</i>

43:27.618 --> 43:30.519
Today, the American and French alliance

43:30.555 --> 43:31.837
is honored...

43:33.291 --> 43:34.723
to accept yours.

44:06.891 --> 44:08.991
Forward march!
