00:30.128 --> 00:30.930
Okay.

00:31.016 --> 00:34.118
Um, Buzz.
If you're through in there...

00:34.783 --> 00:37.155
We have pictures of
all of our victims out here.

00:37.596 --> 00:43.100
Oh, Buzz.
Get these, uh, books here.

00:55.576 --> 00:57.577
This is Skander's grandfather,
Shariq.

00:57.578 --> 00:58.811
He got run over by a police car

00:58.812 --> 01:01.548
while he was trying to murder
his son.

01:01.549 --> 01:03.516
Skander's mother, Anila,
and Aunt Sara --

01:03.517 --> 01:05.518
we found both of them
with their throats cut.

01:05.519 --> 01:08.521
And this is Skander...

01:08.522 --> 01:11.558
Who we currently have
in L.A.P.D. custody.

01:11.559 --> 01:13.526
Lieutenant,
are you all right?

01:13.527 --> 01:15.528
Yeah.

01:15.529 --> 01:18.031
Mmm...

01:18.065 --> 01:19.832
Okay.
Rigor's setting in.

01:19.867 --> 01:21.167
So I'd put
the time of death

01:21.202 --> 01:22.335
between two
to five hours ago.

01:22.369 --> 01:24.637
So when Skander
was with us.

01:24.672 --> 01:26.272
She's got
a good-sized hematoma

01:26.307 --> 01:29.809
on the back of her skull
right here.

01:32.546 --> 01:35.682
So, the killer
knocks her down,

01:35.716 --> 01:38.017
and then he slits her throat
from ear to ear.

01:38.052 --> 01:40.186
Just like her sister,
if it's her.

01:40.221 --> 01:41.321
It is, Chief.
Sara Marku Miller.

01:41.355 --> 01:43.523
She's a nurse
at St. Sebastian Hospital.

01:43.557 --> 01:45.992
Someone's giving this family
their own private genocide.

01:46.026 --> 01:48.628
And for Christmas,
no less.

01:48.662 --> 01:51.998
Yeah, well...
Killer broke in

01:52.032 --> 01:54.334
and probably waited
for her to come home.

01:54.368 --> 01:56.002
She's got a printer
and a router,

01:56.036 --> 01:57.170
but no computer in sight.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.871
Again,
just like her sister.

01:58.906 --> 02:01.107
All right, Lieutenant,
uh, let's amend our warrant

02:01.141 --> 02:02.208
to include Sara Miller's

02:02.243 --> 02:04.577
Internet-service provider,
please.

02:04.612 --> 02:06.179
I'd like access to her e-mail
as soon as possible.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.014
So, Shariq Marku,
two days ago,

02:09.049 --> 02:11.517
dies trying to
kill his son, Armand.

02:11.552 --> 02:15.755
And then Shariq's daughter Anila
turns up murdered.

02:15.789 --> 02:18.258
And now his other daughter,
Sara, also murdered?

02:18.292 --> 02:20.927
Little Skander's the only one
who hasn't been touched.

02:20.961 --> 02:23.263
Yeah, and he also told us
that his Uncle Armand was dead

02:23.297 --> 02:25.064
and that his aunt
lived in Kosovo.

02:25.099 --> 02:27.033
Well, maybe if
we're straight with him,

02:27.067 --> 02:28.368
he'll be straight
with us.

02:28.402 --> 02:30.069
I think it's time to tell
that boy what's going on.

02:30.104 --> 02:32.905
Lieutenant Provenza,
I hate to ask you,

02:32.940 --> 02:34.741
but you've spent the most time
with Skander.

02:34.775 --> 02:36.175
- Would you?
- Right.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.511
- If you could...
- Right. Okay.

02:38.545 --> 02:41.281
I'll, um...
I'll talk him through it.

02:43.284 --> 02:45.251
Detective Gabriel,
would you call in Dr. Morales

02:45.286 --> 02:47.253
to perform another autopsy,
please?

02:47.288 --> 02:48.755
Preferably tonight
if at all possible.

02:48.789 --> 02:50.223
Uh, Chief, I'm pretty sure

02:50.257 --> 02:52.091
the doctor's gonna
have a problem with that.

02:52.126 --> 02:54.894
Why?

02:54.928 --> 02:57.897
Dr. Morales:
'Cause I was supposed to
be in Palm Springs yesterday.

02:57.931 --> 03:00.066
And because you keep
special-requesting me,

03:00.100 --> 03:02.068
now I'm gonna miss meeting
my boyfriend's family.

03:02.102 --> 03:04.070
Well, I'm sure they'll all
be even fonder of you

03:04.104 --> 03:06.539
once they understand
why you're late.

03:06.573 --> 03:07.740
What's wrong?

03:07.775 --> 03:09.542
"Miss Miller."

03:09.576 --> 03:11.744
Is she related to the woman
you brought in yesterday?

03:11.779 --> 03:13.313
- Yeah, she's her sister.
- Why?

03:13.347 --> 03:15.148
Lots of the same,
old scars.

03:15.182 --> 03:18.318
She was tortured...
Brutally.

03:18.352 --> 03:20.553
Burns -- looks like from
the same kind of heated knife

03:20.587 --> 03:22.322
used on the other woman.

03:22.356 --> 03:24.190
Let's concentrate on what happened
this afternoon, shall we?

03:24.224 --> 03:26.092
Yeah, like this wound
going across her neck here.

03:26.126 --> 03:28.094
What can you tell us about
the knife used to kill her?

03:28.128 --> 03:30.763
It was razor-sharp,
and it cut from left to right.

03:30.798 --> 03:33.433
Aside from that, there's no way
to match it to a weapon.

03:33.467 --> 03:35.101
Great --
so the M.O. is the same.

03:35.135 --> 03:36.569
But other than that,
we got nothing.

03:36.603 --> 03:38.237
I'll go back
over her sister's body,

03:38.272 --> 03:40.106
see if there's anything else
they have in common.

03:40.140 --> 03:41.941
Does that mean you have to
miss Christmas dinner

03:41.975 --> 03:43.242
with your boyfriend?

03:43.277 --> 03:45.278
Kyle and his family
should spend some time alone.

03:47.081 --> 03:48.081
Well,
you're more than welcome

03:48.115 --> 03:49.449
to have Christmas dinner
with <i>us.</i>

03:49.483 --> 03:51.084
My mom and dad
are in town,

03:51.118 --> 03:53.453
and -- and the whole division
is coming over for --

03:53.487 --> 03:54.954
Oh, that sounds merry.

03:54.988 --> 03:56.656
I'll think about it.

03:57.758 --> 03:59.225
Are you okay, doctor?

03:59.259 --> 04:01.027
You know
that moment every year

04:01.061 --> 04:03.529
when it suddenly begins
to feel like Christmas?

04:03.564 --> 04:04.897
Yes.

04:04.932 --> 04:06.499
Not happening for me.

04:13.440 --> 04:16.776
Uh-huh.
All right. Bye-bye.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.310
Okay, Chief,
not to worry --

04:18.345 --> 04:21.247
the black-and-whites are all in
place at the Marku residence.

04:21.281 --> 04:24.250
Armand, his wife, their kids,
and her parents

04:24.284 --> 04:25.752
are all safe
and accounted for.

04:25.786 --> 04:26.919
Thank you, Lieutenant.

04:26.954 --> 04:28.087
But, uh, Mrs. Marku

04:28.122 --> 04:29.922
is getting bent out of shape
a little,

04:29.957 --> 04:31.257
already
talking harassment.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.292
Well, as long
as they all stay alive.

04:33.327 --> 04:34.994
Chief,
so, I've left messages

04:35.028 --> 04:36.996
at the Kosovar Consulate
and at Interpol.

04:37.030 --> 04:39.298
I'm trying to see what I can find
out about these blood feuds.

04:39.333 --> 04:41.100
You got your Bosnians,
your Serbs,

04:41.135 --> 04:42.468
your Croats,
and your Albanians.

04:42.503 --> 04:44.270
They're like our street gangs,

04:44.304 --> 04:46.939
only they've been fighting
each other for 800 years.

04:46.974 --> 04:49.976
One thing I did
come across, Chief --

04:50.010 --> 04:52.078
this Albanian code of honor,
known as Kanun.

04:52.112 --> 04:54.247
You can't kill anyone
inside their own home.

04:54.281 --> 04:57.417
Also, it absolutely forbids
the murder of women.

04:57.451 --> 04:58.751
Yeah,
but you get a free pass

04:58.786 --> 05:00.453
for the rape
and for the torture?

05:01.955 --> 05:03.055
Ohh!

05:03.090 --> 05:04.490
Lieutenant,
how's it going with the boy?

05:04.525 --> 05:06.959
Well, for a kid

05:06.994 --> 05:10.630
who just found out that his
family has been annihilated...

05:10.664 --> 05:12.064
About what you'd expect.

05:12.099 --> 05:14.434
Well, did you ask Skander
why he told us

05:14.468 --> 05:15.601
that his Uncle was dead

05:15.636 --> 05:16.936
or that his aunt
was in Kosovo

05:16.970 --> 05:18.271
or anything
about the e-mails?

05:18.305 --> 05:19.772
C-Chief, Chief.
Chief, please.

05:19.807 --> 05:24.277
He's -- he's been crying
most of the night, and...

05:24.311 --> 05:26.679
Well, I'm not doing
so well myself anymore.

05:26.713 --> 05:29.015
Let's just give him
a minute, huh?

05:29.049 --> 05:30.349
Mm.

05:32.019 --> 05:33.619
Um...

05:33.654 --> 05:35.788
Who should I, uh...
Who should I ask

05:35.823 --> 05:38.224
about delivering
the Christmas gifts

05:38.258 --> 05:40.359
to our kids
at the shelter?

05:40.394 --> 05:43.162
Good morning,
Major Crimes, and, uh...

05:43.197 --> 05:44.931
Merry Christmas.

05:44.965 --> 05:46.098
Commander,
Merry Christmas.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.167
What a surprise to see you here
this morning.

05:48.202 --> 05:50.503
Yeah, two of my kids
woke up sick,

05:50.537 --> 05:52.104
so I thought,
"hey, why not go to church?"

05:52.139 --> 05:55.107
Unless you need me
to do something for you.

05:55.142 --> 05:56.409
Uh, Chief Johnson?

05:57.811 --> 06:00.446
Uh, y-yes, Commander,
actually

06:00.481 --> 06:03.382
there is something that
we could use your help with.

06:03.417 --> 06:05.318
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
Great.

06:09.256 --> 06:11.858
How are you at,
"ho, ho, ho"?

06:20.400 --> 06:22.502
Chief Johnson,
you can now hear

06:22.536 --> 06:25.805
the 911 calls made during
Shariq's attack on his son.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.074
Oh, I thought you dropped those
off at the sound lab yesterday.

06:28.108 --> 06:30.142
I did, but since they won't
get to it till tomorrow,

06:30.177 --> 06:32.912
I thought maybe your team
could sort it out.

06:32.946 --> 06:36.749
First, I combined the background
audio from all the calls

06:36.783 --> 06:39.585
to our 911 operators
during the attack.

06:39.620 --> 06:41.287
Then I added
the sound portion

06:41.321 --> 06:44.190
of the film one of our witnesses
took with his cellphone,

06:44.224 --> 06:46.492
after which I managed
to cobble together

06:46.527 --> 06:47.693
the argument between Armand
and his father.

06:47.728 --> 06:49.929
Merry Christmas.

06:49.963 --> 06:51.697
Would you
like to hear it?

06:51.732 --> 06:52.765
Yes, I would.

06:52.799 --> 06:53.933
A request, first.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.835
Uh, certainly.

06:55.869 --> 06:59.272
Since I worked really hard to
put this tape together for you,

06:59.306 --> 07:01.107
I would like another chance
to talk to little Skander.

07:01.141 --> 07:02.775
Oh, that's delicate.

07:02.809 --> 07:04.310
Oh, because if I could
get that boy

07:04.344 --> 07:05.778
to change
his ridiculous story

07:05.812 --> 07:08.748
about Chief Pope kidnapping him
and holding him at gunpoint,

07:08.782 --> 07:11.851
I may be able to make
the last flight to Salt Lake

07:11.885 --> 07:13.486
and get to Park City
for Christmas with my family.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.420
- So, please, if you just --
- Skander's in a difficult place right now.

07:15.422 --> 07:17.222
- Five minutes.
- He just found out what's
happened to his family.

07:17.224 --> 07:19.025
And then all I'll need is to get
Joan Marku to drop her lawsuit,

07:19.059 --> 07:20.660
and then I'll be gone
for weeks!

07:20.694 --> 07:22.094
All right. Look.

07:22.129 --> 07:24.764
Uh, when Lieutenant Provenza comes
back in to talk to the boy,

07:24.798 --> 07:26.666
in addition
to our questions,

07:26.700 --> 07:28.668
I'll get him to drop the charges
he made against Chief Pope,

07:28.702 --> 07:30.403
and then you're halfway free
to go, is that right?

07:30.437 --> 07:32.738
Fine. Thanks.
Buzz, play the tape.

07:32.773 --> 07:34.407
That you worked
so hard on.

07:38.478 --> 07:40.913
It's still in Albanian.

07:40.948 --> 07:42.582
Of course
it's still in Albanian.

07:42.616 --> 07:44.083
It's always been
in Albanian.

07:44.117 --> 07:46.018
Well, I just assumed
that you had it translated.

07:46.053 --> 07:48.187
Well, where on earth am I gonna
get an Albanian translator

07:48.221 --> 07:49.956
on Christmas morning?

07:49.990 --> 07:51.290
Excuse me, Chief.

07:51.325 --> 07:54.126
I just got access to Sara Marku
Miller's e-mail account.

07:54.161 --> 07:56.128
And I came across
a batch of messages

07:56.163 --> 07:57.363
she sent to her sister.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.867
These are in Albanian,
too.

08:01.902 --> 08:05.037
Yeah. Sorry about that.
But look.

08:05.072 --> 08:08.307
The day before everyone
in this family started dying,

08:08.342 --> 08:10.643
Sara sent her sister, Anila,
this photograph.

08:10.677 --> 08:11.978
Joan Marku.

08:12.012 --> 08:14.480
Maybe that's why
the computers were stolen

08:14.514 --> 08:16.549
from their homes -- so we
wouldn't see these e-mails.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.417
Uh, Lieutenant would you please,

08:18.452 --> 08:20.586
um, have Armand's wife
brought back in here?

08:20.621 --> 08:22.588
I need to talk to her.

08:22.623 --> 08:24.023
Hello, Fritzi.

08:24.057 --> 08:25.758
Uh, uh, honey?

08:25.792 --> 08:27.093
We got a bit
of a problem here.

08:27.127 --> 08:28.928
Fritzi! Let me!

08:28.962 --> 08:31.664
Brenda Leigh, there's been
a terrible crime!

08:31.698 --> 08:33.599
What? Mama? Where?

08:33.634 --> 08:35.668
Right here
at your home!

08:35.702 --> 08:37.336
Let me have that!

08:37.371 --> 08:40.972
We need police assistance,
and we need it right now!

08:41.008 --> 08:42.475
Do you copy?!

08:42.509 --> 08:46.112
Yes! Yes, daddy, I copy.
I'm on my way.

09:07.167 --> 09:08.968
Brenda Leigh!
Brenda Leigh!

09:09.002 --> 09:11.537
Brenda Leigh,
we've been robbed!

09:11.571 --> 09:14.040
Oh, mama, just calm down
and tell me what happened.

09:14.074 --> 09:16.275
I came out here...

09:16.309 --> 09:19.111
I came out here to collect
the Christmas presents

09:19.146 --> 09:20.446
and put them
under the tree.

09:21.648 --> 09:24.283
Well, the door
was hanging wide open!

09:24.317 --> 09:27.953
And the gifts had been stolen.
Aw.

09:27.988 --> 09:29.889
Plus, our microwave!

09:29.923 --> 09:32.992
Isn't it lucky your father
found the crime-scene tape

09:33.026 --> 09:35.761
in the laundry room?

09:35.796 --> 09:38.764
I have an idea. Why don't
we all go back inside?

09:38.799 --> 09:39.765
Right.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.333
I called 911

09:41.368 --> 09:43.669
and told them
what happened.

09:43.704 --> 09:45.337
And the lady
on the phone

09:45.372 --> 09:47.506
told me it was not
an emergency.

09:47.541 --> 09:49.842
Out-and-out
stealing Christmas!

09:49.876 --> 09:52.812
That's not an emergency?!

09:52.846 --> 09:57.183
Mama, I am so,
so sorry about this.

09:57.217 --> 09:59.351
Now, you just tell me
what's missing, and, uh --

09:59.386 --> 10:00.720
will you stop
trying to find out

10:00.754 --> 10:02.188
what you're getting
for Christmas?

10:02.222 --> 10:04.123
You do this every year.

10:04.157 --> 10:05.958
Wait, wait, wait.
How about this?

10:05.992 --> 10:08.427
I will describe
the wrapping paper,

10:08.462 --> 10:11.163
which was
a beautiful combination

10:11.198 --> 10:13.666
of flying reindeer
and penguins and elves --

10:13.700 --> 10:15.267
Willie Ray,
the wrapping paper

10:15.302 --> 10:16.669
would have all been torn off
by now.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.270
Oh.

10:18.305 --> 10:20.506
Here's the truth, okay?

10:20.540 --> 10:23.008
It's highly doubtful

10:23.043 --> 10:24.877
we will ever be able to
get those presents back.

10:24.911 --> 10:27.713
But you have to
file a police report.

10:27.748 --> 10:29.849
So we'll just
write it all down

10:29.883 --> 10:33.652
and be thankful that the holiday
isn't just about gifts.

10:35.489 --> 10:36.622
You're right.

10:36.656 --> 10:40.059
That was --
that was very well said, son.

10:40.093 --> 10:43.529
The tinsel,
the mistletoes --

10:43.563 --> 10:47.900
those are not the reasons we get
together every December 25th.

10:47.934 --> 10:49.301
No, no.

10:49.336 --> 10:51.137
What makes this holiday special

10:51.171 --> 10:55.474
is a poor baby
who was born in a stable...

10:55.509 --> 11:01.347
And the people who gathered
together to celebrate his birth.

11:01.381 --> 11:04.016
Which is why,
as long as we're here...

11:04.050 --> 11:07.319
The four of us,
together...

11:08.755 --> 11:10.055
...Nothing else matters.

11:27.407 --> 11:29.008
Ooh.

11:29.042 --> 11:31.277
Deputy Chief Johnson.

11:31.311 --> 11:33.012
Ohh.

11:33.046 --> 11:34.847
All right.

11:34.881 --> 11:38.517
Um, just tell the Markus to,
uh, stay calm,

11:38.552 --> 11:40.953
and I will get there
just as soon as I can.

11:40.987 --> 11:43.389
Thank you, Detective.

11:43.423 --> 11:46.358
I'll try
and make it home for dinner.

11:46.393 --> 11:48.527
"Try"?

11:48.562 --> 11:50.896
You have invited
the entire police department.

11:50.931 --> 11:52.731
I-I know that, mama.

11:52.766 --> 11:54.800
And we're all gonna do the very
best we can to get there --

11:54.835 --> 11:56.435
I mean...Here.

11:57.404 --> 12:01.807
Oh, uh, any luck getting
my present from <i>you?</i>

12:01.842 --> 12:03.742
You didn't really think
I was gonna find

12:03.777 --> 12:06.045
an Albanian translator
on Christmas day, did you?

12:06.079 --> 12:08.948
Ohh!
I ask you for one thing.

12:13.186 --> 12:14.887
Mama, I'll come back
just as soon as I can.

12:24.030 --> 12:27.666
What are we gonna do
about dinner?

12:32.036 --> 12:33.456
Chief I've been doing
some digging around

12:33.474 --> 12:36.376
and four days ago, Joan Marku
had outpatient surgery

12:36.410 --> 12:38.778
at the same hospital
Sara Marku worked.

12:38.813 --> 12:41.348
And then the next day,
Sara sent her sister, Anila,

12:41.382 --> 12:43.049
this e-mail.

12:43.084 --> 12:44.050
And that's when
everything went to hell.

12:44.085 --> 12:45.952
But what's it say,
this e-mail?

12:45.986 --> 12:47.620
I still need
a translator.

12:47.655 --> 12:48.988
No, but I was
giving it a shot

12:49.023 --> 12:50.890
with this Albanian
translations guide.

12:50.925 --> 12:53.893
And I actually recognized
a few words from this e-mail.

12:53.928 --> 12:55.628
"Hospital," "ghost"...

12:57.198 --> 12:58.331
I-I'll keep working on it.

12:58.366 --> 13:00.133
Wait.
Wait a minute, Chief.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.801
They both speak Albanian,
don't they?

13:01.836 --> 13:04.671
Yes, but which one
should I ask for help?

13:04.705 --> 13:05.905
Chief, before you decide,

13:05.940 --> 13:07.741
I stopped by the lab
to pick up the DNA results

13:07.775 --> 13:09.676
we ran
on the Marku family.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.578
And it looks like
we made a mistake

13:11.612 --> 13:13.079
when we handed in
our samples.

13:13.114 --> 13:14.814
The results
are pretty interesting.

13:19.086 --> 13:21.221
I want to know
exactly why Skander thought

13:21.255 --> 13:23.089
his Uncle Armand was dead.

13:23.124 --> 13:25.425
Would you please tell
Lieutenant Provenza he needs

13:25.459 --> 13:27.827
to start asking Skander those
questions he's been putting off?

13:27.862 --> 13:29.829
Yes, ma'am.

13:34.969 --> 13:36.536
Since you've dragged us
in here,

13:36.570 --> 13:38.571
the least you can do
is let us see Skander.

13:38.606 --> 13:40.006
Where is he?

13:40.040 --> 13:42.742
We're concerned about releasing
Skander into your custody

13:42.777 --> 13:45.078
until we can confirm that
you're no longer in danger.

13:45.112 --> 13:49.082
And you're concerned about
our safety based on what?

13:49.116 --> 13:51.918
Regrettably,
based on another murder.

13:51.952 --> 13:55.054
Your sister, Mr. Marku --
Sara.

13:55.089 --> 13:58.091
We found her dead in her home.
Her throat had been cut.

14:02.963 --> 14:05.398
I believe
you warned your nephew

14:05.433 --> 14:07.867
about some sort
of blood feud.

14:09.437 --> 14:11.404
Yes.
What?

14:12.640 --> 14:15.074
Why would you say that?

14:15.109 --> 14:16.676
I was sure my father

14:16.710 --> 14:18.578
would have started
teaching Skander the Kanun.

14:19.647 --> 14:22.515
I thought, if I told him
our family was in hiding,

14:22.550 --> 14:24.751
a blood feud would help him
understand why.

14:24.785 --> 14:26.419
And blood certainly has
something to do with it.

14:31.292 --> 14:36.729
Mrs. Marku...we have something
we'd like you to hear.

14:36.764 --> 14:38.465
We paired the audio
from the attack

14:38.499 --> 14:40.233
with one witness's
cellphone footage.

14:40.267 --> 14:42.902
It's only a small portion
of the exchange.

14:42.937 --> 14:44.571
It's a bit rough in parts, but you
should be able to make it out.

14:44.605 --> 14:46.706
And you can see everything.

14:52.580 --> 14:55.281
"You are...Not my son."

14:59.753 --> 15:01.688
"You have...

15:01.722 --> 15:04.791
Blood on your hands."

15:06.360 --> 15:10.497
"You are...A ghost."

15:22.243 --> 15:24.244
"Ghost."

15:25.746 --> 15:28.748
What did Shariq mean
by calling Armand a ghost?

15:30.551 --> 15:32.185
I...I don't know.

15:32.219 --> 15:34.587
All right, then,
how about this?

15:34.622 --> 15:37.590
Can you account for your
whereabouts yesterday?

15:37.625 --> 15:38.925
<i>My</i> whereabouts?

15:44.398 --> 15:46.232
I-I was with my husband.

15:46.267 --> 15:47.500
And he'll back you up
on that?

15:49.236 --> 15:51.371
Are you suggesting
<i>I</i> killed these women?

15:51.405 --> 15:55.308
I am a human rights
attorney.

15:55.342 --> 15:58.244
I have visited the burned-out
remains of the village

15:58.279 --> 16:00.713
where my husband's friends
and relatives were murdered.

16:00.748 --> 16:03.716
And I have spent
the last 10 years of my life

16:03.751 --> 16:06.219
seeking out the persons
responsible for this...

16:06.253 --> 16:09.822
This horrible tragedy that
Armand was lucky to survive.

16:09.857 --> 16:13.459
Ma'am, I don't know if
I would call it luck, exactly.

16:13.494 --> 16:17.964
Chief, I just listened
to Skander explain to Provenza

16:17.998 --> 16:20.466
why he thought
his Uncle Armand was dead.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.802
And the story, well...

16:22.836 --> 16:24.604
Had a familiar ring to it.

16:25.873 --> 16:28.474
<i>It's why Babo</i>
<i>hated the police.</i>

16:28.509 --> 16:30.910
<i>I told him</i>
<i>it was different here.</i>

16:30.945 --> 16:33.746
<i>He said, "no."</i>

16:33.781 --> 16:36.583
That the police
are always bad...

16:36.617 --> 16:41.287
That they kill people
for no reason.

16:51.498 --> 16:53.166
That's why
he wasn't helping us.

16:53.200 --> 16:58.538
His grandfather had a built-in
distrust of the authorities.

16:58.572 --> 17:01.040
Now listen to the rest
of the interview, Mrs. Marku.

17:01.075 --> 17:03.376
I think you'll find it
very interesting.

17:03.410 --> 17:05.778
<i>So it was</i>
<i>the Serbian police</i>

17:05.813 --> 17:09.115
<i>your grandfather</i>
<i>was talking about.</i>

17:09.148 --> 17:11.818
I guess.

17:14.622 --> 17:16.455
Well,
he called them ghosts.

17:21.362 --> 17:24.964
My mom called them that,
too.

17:24.999 --> 17:29.135
Because they came
in the middle of the night...

17:29.169 --> 17:32.138
Out of nowhere,
and they just --

17:32.172 --> 17:33.873
they killed people.

17:35.776 --> 17:37.110
Like your Uncle.

17:45.185 --> 17:49.489
Just see if you can remember
what your grandfather told you

17:49.523 --> 17:51.457
about the night
your Uncle died.

17:53.894 --> 17:59.766
Tell me the same way
that he told you.

18:02.302 --> 18:05.938
I asked him about it
a lot --

18:05.973 --> 18:08.441
what happened
to my Uncle...

18:08.475 --> 18:11.778
Why they left Kosovo.

18:11.812 --> 18:15.314
And he always told me
I was too little to understand.

18:18.519 --> 18:21.154
But one night last year...

18:23.857 --> 18:27.994
...It was late,
and it was raining outside.

18:28.028 --> 18:30.496
And he was sad.
And I asked him why.

18:30.531 --> 18:32.665
And he said,
"it was raining...

18:32.700 --> 18:34.734
Just like this...
...Just like this."

18:36.270 --> 18:39.439
...The night they were coming
to our village.

18:39.473 --> 18:42.675
The ghosts.

18:48.282 --> 18:52.151
I took Aunt Sara...

18:52.186 --> 18:55.822
Uncle Armand,
and your mother...

18:55.856 --> 19:00.326
And we ran to the grocery shop
owned by my nephew.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.663
There was a basement there
where we could hide with others.

19:07.468 --> 19:09.635
And there was baby.

19:11.138 --> 19:12.772
She starts to cry.

19:12.806 --> 19:14.807
We try to make her stop

19:14.842 --> 19:19.245
because upstairs we could
hear the men looking for us.

19:19.279 --> 19:22.915
But she only cries louder.

19:26.286 --> 19:28.921
And that is how
they found us.

19:28.956 --> 19:32.425
Three of them with flashlights
come downstairs.

19:35.462 --> 19:37.263
They took women away...

19:38.632 --> 19:40.533
...And start shooting us.

19:41.902 --> 19:43.936
I turned
to protect my son...

19:43.971 --> 19:47.273
And they shoot me in back.

19:48.976 --> 19:50.610
I fall, and...

19:52.079 --> 19:55.882
...They shoot Armand
two times in the chest.

19:58.919 --> 20:02.054
He falls on top of me...

20:02.089 --> 20:04.557
And...

20:04.591 --> 20:06.058
I am still...

20:08.428 --> 20:12.231
...Underneath my son...

20:12.266 --> 20:15.067
Listening as...

20:15.102 --> 20:17.637
All breath
goes out of him.

20:20.340 --> 20:22.041
What about the baby girl?

20:28.916 --> 20:31.217
She no longer cries.

20:44.998 --> 20:48.334
What happened
to mom and Aunt Sara?

20:49.336 --> 20:50.670
When the men
took them away?

20:57.611 --> 20:58.945
Terrible things.

21:06.386 --> 21:09.021
Terrible...

21:09.056 --> 21:11.357
Terrible things.

21:12.726 --> 21:15.728
"Terrible,
terrible things."

21:17.297 --> 21:19.799
That's all
he would say about it.

21:22.069 --> 21:23.569
"Terrible things."

21:28.008 --> 21:32.511
I've heard this story before,
and so have you.

21:32.546 --> 21:35.882
My God.
Mrs. Marku!

21:37.484 --> 21:41.120
There was only one survivor
in that story,

21:41.154 --> 21:42.855
but we've heard it twice.
It's a mistake.

21:42.890 --> 21:44.824
So if Shariq and your husband were both there...
No, I don't believe it.

21:44.858 --> 21:46.659
...Then Armand was one
of the men with a flashlight.

21:46.693 --> 21:49.128
Just leave me alone.
Shariq wasn't there!

21:49.162 --> 21:51.464
Our pathologist

21:51.498 --> 21:53.966
dug this out of the old man's
back at the morgue.

21:54.001 --> 21:55.968
It was lodged right next
to his spinal column.

21:56.003 --> 21:57.803
Now, we've identified
that bullet as being

21:57.838 --> 22:00.306
from a Zastava CZ 99
pistol --

22:00.340 --> 22:03.142
standard issue
to Serbian soldiers.

22:03.176 --> 22:05.478
Armand is alive.

22:05.512 --> 22:06.979
He's alive.

22:07.014 --> 22:10.483
When your husband's hand
was slashed in the attack,

22:10.517 --> 22:12.184
some of his blood
got on Shariq's clothing.

22:12.219 --> 22:14.820
And we tested the DNA
by mistake,

22:14.855 --> 22:17.423
and when we compared it to
the rest of the Marku family...

22:17.457 --> 22:19.859
We found that the man you know
as Armand is not Shariq's son.

22:19.893 --> 22:22.662
Anila and Sara
are not his sisters.

22:22.696 --> 22:24.897
But he <i>is</i> related
to one person here today.

22:28.635 --> 22:30.102
No.

22:30.137 --> 22:32.538
How do you think little Skander
came into the world?

22:34.041 --> 22:37.009
He's not
your husband's nephew.

22:37.044 --> 22:39.178
Skander is his son.

22:39.212 --> 22:41.514
And he's also living proof

22:41.548 --> 22:42.982
that you're married
to a war criminal.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.191
Why did all this
turn up now?

23:13.225 --> 23:16.027
Because you had a benign
skin tumor removed last week.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.129
Sara Marku
worked at the hospital

23:18.164 --> 23:20.432
where you had
your procedure.

23:20.466 --> 23:23.435
We think that she saw your
last name on the intake log

23:23.469 --> 23:25.537
and did a little research.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.772
She found out that someone
was living in L.A.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.441
Disguised
as her dead brother.

23:31.277 --> 23:34.379
So...

23:34.413 --> 23:39.384
So you're suggesting
the man I married...

23:39.418 --> 23:42.087
Raped all those women
and --

23:42.121 --> 23:44.255
and he murdered
those men.

23:44.290 --> 23:47.559
A-and then he took
the identity of --

23:47.593 --> 23:49.394
of the victim
he most resembled, yes --

23:49.428 --> 23:50.595
Armand Marku.

23:50.629 --> 23:52.163
Oh, God.

23:52.198 --> 23:53.365
And then slipped
out of Kosovo

23:53.399 --> 23:54.966
before anyone could point him
out as a war criminal.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.475
They specialized
in identity theft.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.145
We trained them in it,
the serbs,

24:07.179 --> 24:12.150
back when we thought the
Albanians were the bad guys.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.185
They practiced terrorism,
too, you know,

24:14.220 --> 24:15.520
the Albanians.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.355
Both groups behaved badly.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.524
And w-we changed sides
several times ourselves.

24:19.558 --> 24:21.960
Really? W-whose side
should we be on

24:21.994 --> 24:24.496
now that Anila and Sara Marku's
throats have been cut?

24:29.635 --> 24:32.604
You said you'd investigated what
happened in Armand's village.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.739
Were you ever able to identify
who was responsible?

24:36.342 --> 24:38.309
No.

24:38.344 --> 24:41.479
No names. No descriptions.
Nothing. God, I...

24:41.514 --> 24:43.481
I can't see Armand that way.
I can't see it.

24:43.516 --> 24:46.384
Three the people who could
see him that way ended up dead.

24:47.953 --> 24:50.422
You said that you've
been trying for years

24:50.456 --> 24:52.757
to obtain justice
for Armand Marku.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.259
Well,
here's your chance.

24:54.293 --> 24:57.595
We may not be able to get
your husband for his war crimes,

24:57.630 --> 24:59.731
but he does have blood
on his hands

24:59.765 --> 25:02.067
for the murders
of Anila and Sara.

25:02.101 --> 25:05.136
Blood on his hands.
Wait a minute.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.807
After he came home from
the fight with his father --

25:08.841 --> 25:09.908
I mean, Shariq --

25:09.942 --> 25:10.942
you saw blood?

25:10.976 --> 25:12.777
No.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.513
Armand walked into the kitchen,
and he had changed clothes.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.482
I-I asked him why, and --

25:17.516 --> 25:19.317
and he said
he was covered in blood

25:19.351 --> 25:21.486
after the police car
ran over Shariq.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.654
But I-in the video
you showed me,

25:22.688 --> 25:23.855
there was no blood on him
at all.

25:23.889 --> 25:25.290
What happened
to those clothes?

25:25.324 --> 25:27.459
Uh, he said he was so upset,
he burned everything.

25:27.493 --> 25:28.760
Hr even scrubbed the car.

25:28.794 --> 25:30.428
The car?
Was there blood in the car?

25:30.463 --> 25:32.197
Yes.
Well, that's what he said.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.631
I-is it the same car
you drove here today?

25:33.666 --> 25:35.266
Uh,
m-may I have the keys?

25:35.301 --> 25:38.603
Yes, uh, but
I-I didn't see any...

25:38.637 --> 25:40.405
Oh, my...

25:41.974 --> 25:45.443
Now, everything I've just
told you is privileged.

25:45.478 --> 25:46.611
I'm his wife.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.346
No, if there's even a trace
of blood on that car,

25:48.380 --> 25:50.181
I can match it
to Anila.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.650
But, wait, wait, wait.
Chief Johnson, I know the law.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.886
- I do, too, Joan. Very well.
- Then you have to understand

25:54.920 --> 25:58.890
you've just wandered into
extremely murky territory here.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.025
So let me
be clear about this.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.862
I never saw any blood, not on
Armand's clothes or in the car.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.997
Everything I know
comes from what he told me.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.233
And marital privilege
means you can't use

26:08.267 --> 26:10.168
anything I've said
against my husband.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.037
Oh, and the car's registered
only in Armand's name.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.140
So you can't
get a warrant.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.407
No, no, no,
I-I won't need a warrant

26:16.442 --> 26:18.042
if I can see blood through
the vehicle's window.

26:18.077 --> 26:22.213
But there is something
I need you to do.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.982
And it might be
very difficult.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.952
What could be more difficult
than <i>this?</i>

26:38.831 --> 26:40.798
<i>Joanie.</i>

26:40.833 --> 26:43.468
<i>Joanie.</i>

26:43.502 --> 26:46.137
<i>Are you okay?</i>

26:48.674 --> 26:49.674
I'm scared.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.751
<i>What did they ask you?</i>

26:59.785 --> 27:01.519
They wanted to know
where I was

27:01.554 --> 27:03.188
at the time
of Sara's murder.

27:03.222 --> 27:05.456
What did you say?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.792
That I was with you.

27:07.826 --> 27:10.295
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>I will say the same.</i>

27:10.329 --> 27:11.930
<i>But what if they find out</i>
<i>we weren't together?</i>

27:11.964 --> 27:13.198
<i>What if they find out</i>

27:13.232 --> 27:14.766
<i>you weren't at home</i>
<i>and I have no way --</i>

27:14.800 --> 27:17.268
listen to me.
Joanie, they won't find out.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.603
We'll be okay.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.906
May we be lucky enough

27:21.941 --> 27:25.443
to call this our worst
Christmas ever, yes?

27:25.477 --> 27:27.445
<i>Our children, too.</i>

27:27.479 --> 27:29.047
That's his alibi broken.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.883
No expectation of privacy
in a police station,

27:31.917 --> 27:33.218
even if you're talking
to your wife.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.386
That doesn't get you
to an arrest for murder.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.388
It might.
Just -- j-just one minute.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.057
<i>But will they let us</i>

27:39.091 --> 27:41.292
<i>take Skander home with us,</i>
<i>you think?</i>

27:41.327 --> 27:42.860
Probably.

27:43.796 --> 27:47.999
They -- they want to make sure
none of us are in any danger

27:48.033 --> 27:50.401
from whoever
killed your sisters.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.869
Listen to me, joanie.
Listen. Listen.

27:53.539 --> 27:54.939
There can be
no "probably" in this.

27:58.277 --> 28:00.078
Tell me
I can search that car.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.113
I say you can.
But here's the video.

28:02.147 --> 28:04.082
And unfortunately,
as you can see...

28:04.116 --> 28:07.085
Though the Marku car
is in our parking structure...

28:07.119 --> 28:08.419
We looked into it
from every angle, Chief.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.587
Couldn't see even a stain

28:09.622 --> 28:11.789
that would give us
probable cause to search it.

28:11.824 --> 28:14.125
Did you pull prints
off the driver's-side door?

28:14.159 --> 28:15.493
Would you see to it

28:15.527 --> 28:17.362
that Agent Howard gets a copy
of those prints, please?

28:17.396 --> 28:19.364
A-and let's put patrol officers
around the Markus' car.

28:19.398 --> 28:20.698
I don't want it
leaving the premises.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.634
Look,
this guy told his wife

28:22.668 --> 28:24.669
that there was blood
in the car.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.970
So I say we open it up
and we find the evidence

28:26.005 --> 28:28.306
that ties this scumbag
to at least one of our murders.

28:28.340 --> 28:30.675
Lieutenant, you simply
cannot enter that car

28:30.709 --> 28:32.677
based on a privileged
conversation

28:32.711 --> 28:34.045
between husband and wife.

28:34.079 --> 28:36.047
The DNA match
between Armand and the boy

28:36.081 --> 28:37.382
gives us probable cause.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.884
Not according
to the U.S. Supreme Court,

28:39.918 --> 28:43.388
which regards marital
privilege as, and I quote --

28:43.422 --> 28:45.556
"so essential
to the preservation

28:45.591 --> 28:47.859
"of the marriage relationship

28:47.893 --> 28:49.527
"as to outweigh
the disadvantages to the

28:49.561 --> 28:51.729
administration of justice." "...
Administration of justice."

28:51.764 --> 28:53.965
Uh, Wolfle vs.
The United States.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.366
We could let the car go,

28:55.401 --> 28:57.802
pull it over for a traffic
violation and search it then.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.171
As long as you can swear in court
that you did not pull that car over

29:00.205 --> 29:01.639
based on what
Joan Marku told you.

29:01.674 --> 29:03.474
Can you that?

29:03.509 --> 29:05.009
<i>...The one person</i>
<i>in my life</i>

29:05.044 --> 29:07.445
<i>i have always</i>
<i>been able to count on.</i>

29:07.479 --> 29:08.780
Joan Marku said that
they could never identify

29:08.814 --> 29:10.782
the Serb attackers
from Armand's village.

29:10.816 --> 29:13.284
If that's really true,
I think I have some other way

29:13.319 --> 29:14.419
to arrest her husband
for murder.

29:37.421 --> 29:38.889
Ah, Captain.

29:38.901 --> 29:40.768
We still waiting
for the boy to recant?

29:40.803 --> 29:43.271
Lieutenant Provenza's
getting him

29:43.305 --> 29:44.973
to withdraw
his charges now.

29:45.007 --> 29:48.209
And I expect Joan Marku
will drop the kidnapping suit

29:48.244 --> 29:49.544
as soon as Chief Johnson
is done.

29:49.578 --> 29:51.546
So you're off the hook.

29:51.580 --> 29:54.983
Oh. Good.
So why the long face?

29:57.186 --> 29:59.154
While I've
been waiting here,

29:59.188 --> 30:02.157
the Salt Lake City airport
has been closed due to snow.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.458
No flights in or out
till tomorrow.

30:03.492 --> 30:05.460
So there goes Christmas.

30:05.494 --> 30:08.129
Why, Sharon...

30:08.164 --> 30:11.466
You can have dinner
with all of us here.

30:11.500 --> 30:15.136
Your friend Brenda
wouldn't have it any other way.

30:15.171 --> 30:16.371
My friend Brenda?

30:17.339 --> 30:20.074
My friend Brenda.
You know what?

30:20.109 --> 30:23.411
You come help me finish
with the cooking,

30:23.445 --> 30:26.648
and I'll tell you some fun
stories about Brenda Leigh

30:26.682 --> 30:28.116
when she was a girl.

30:28.150 --> 30:29.284
They'll make you laugh.

30:29.318 --> 30:31.219
I'm sure they will.

30:31.253 --> 30:32.787
Come on!
Okay.

30:32.821 --> 30:36.457
You make a beautiful
Christmas table, Mrs. Johnson.

30:36.492 --> 30:38.126
Willie Ray:
It's so festive.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.929
You wouldn't know they call
this place the murder room,

30:40.963 --> 30:42.096
would you?

30:42.131 --> 30:43.965
Come on.

30:45.367 --> 30:46.701
You can look through
their pictures all you want,

30:46.735 --> 30:50.038
but I ran the fingerprints
of your Armand Marku

30:50.072 --> 30:53.875
against the database of war
criminals wanted by Interpol,

30:53.909 --> 30:55.543
the war crimes tribunal,

30:55.578 --> 30:59.047
and the police
in both Kosovo and Serbia.

30:59.081 --> 31:01.349
And I came up with a big,
fat nothing.

31:02.384 --> 31:05.119
He really is a ghost.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.356
What happened
to your head?

31:08.390 --> 31:11.559
I was hiding something.

31:11.594 --> 31:16.197
Ask me no questions,
and I will tell you no lies.

31:16.232 --> 31:19.400
Anyway, the chances
of you proving that guy

31:19.435 --> 31:21.903
in your conference room
is a Serbian war criminal --

31:21.937 --> 31:24.138
even if he tells you
his real name --

31:24.173 --> 31:25.573
are next to zero.

31:25.608 --> 31:26.874
And he's bound
to know that.

31:26.909 --> 31:30.378
That's
what I'm counting on.

31:32.848 --> 31:36.317
<i>Right this way,</i>
<i>Mr. Marku.</i>

31:36.352 --> 31:39.320
<i>I do not understand why</i>
<i>you have told me my rights.</i>

31:39.355 --> 31:40.722
<i>Are you suspecting me</i>
<i>of something?</i>

31:40.756 --> 31:42.323
Does this have anything
to do with Skander?

31:42.358 --> 31:43.324
Oh,
we want to make sure

31:43.359 --> 31:44.826
that Skander's safe
to go home with you.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.728
Special Agent Howard
from the FBI and I

31:46.762 --> 31:48.830
have a few questions
for you.

31:48.864 --> 31:50.832
What kind of questions?

31:50.866 --> 31:53.901
Well, why don't we start
with your real name?

31:53.936 --> 31:55.937
Excuse me?

31:55.971 --> 31:58.172
It's not Armand Marku.
That much we know for sure.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.675
We tested your DNA...

32:00.709 --> 32:03.678
Which clearly shows you are not
the son of Shariq Marku,

32:03.712 --> 32:09.017
nor are you the brother
of Anila or Sara.

32:09.051 --> 32:13.821
Curiously, however, you
are related to Skander Marku.

32:15.958 --> 32:18.426
He's your son. Now,
we've heard a lot of stories

32:18.460 --> 32:19.727
from you
over the past few days

32:19.762 --> 32:21.863
<i>about why Shariq Marku</i>
<i>tried to kill you.</i>

32:21.897 --> 32:23.031
<i>First, it was because</i>

32:23.065 --> 32:24.499
<i>you were carrying</i>
<i>Christmas presents.</i>

32:24.533 --> 32:26.367
<i>Then it was because you'd</i>
<i>married a Christian girl.</i>

32:26.402 --> 32:28.369
Then it was because
you escaped a genocide.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.805
Now let's try the truth and see
where that leads us, shall we?

32:36.445 --> 32:37.912
All right.

32:37.946 --> 32:40.381
Fine.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.551
I told you
how Joan and I met.

32:43.585 --> 32:45.320
Let me tell you
another love story.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.722
It's about
a young Serbian man

32:47.756 --> 32:49.490
who fell in love
with an Albanian girl.

32:49.525 --> 32:51.059
Her father didn't approve.

32:51.093 --> 32:54.729
And after the war, it was not
just the girl's father

32:54.763 --> 32:57.065
but the whole of Kosovo
that hated him.

32:57.099 --> 33:00.735
So he fled, using the name
of his girlfriend's brother,

33:00.769 --> 33:02.904
who had died
during the conflict.

33:02.938 --> 33:06.074
This man, he --

33:06.108 --> 33:10.912
he never knew what became
of Anila or her family...

33:10.946 --> 33:14.415
And was unaware
he even had a son...

33:14.450 --> 33:17.185
Until a decade later

33:17.219 --> 33:19.320
when the girl's father
tried to kill him.

33:20.889 --> 33:23.024
Well, that's
another great lie,

33:23.058 --> 33:24.359
and I bet,
if I let you sit here,

33:24.393 --> 33:25.927
you could come up
with even more.

33:25.961 --> 33:29.597
But I saw the bodies
of Anila and Sara Marku.

33:29.631 --> 33:32.266
Skander's a lot of things,
but a love child?

33:32.301 --> 33:33.301
It's not one of them.

33:33.335 --> 33:34.969
So let's let
Agent Howard here

33:35.003 --> 33:36.804
tell a story of his own.

33:36.839 --> 33:43.911
I have a roster
of wanted war criminals

33:43.946 --> 33:45.246
from Kosovo and Serbia.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.814
War criminals?

33:46.849 --> 33:48.316
Uh, yes, because
the attack on the village

33:48.350 --> 33:50.985
where the Markus are from
is considered to be

33:51.019 --> 33:54.021
an extreme violation
of the rules of combat.

33:54.056 --> 33:57.024
The person
or persons responsible

33:57.059 --> 34:00.361
for those murders and rapes
should be tried at The Hague.

34:00.396 --> 34:05.199
I think you might be
one of those persons, sir.

34:05.234 --> 34:08.536
Because I did not
want my wife

34:08.570 --> 34:10.670
to know I have a child
with another woman

34:10.706 --> 34:14.275
and I happen to have been
a Serb living in Kosovo,

34:14.309 --> 34:15.877
<i>I must be a war criminal?</i>

34:15.911 --> 34:17.445
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what it's like</i>

34:17.478 --> 34:19.447
<i>to have your country</i>
<i>torn apart.</i>

34:19.481 --> 34:22.617
<i>What the Albanians</i>
<i>did to us was horrifying.</i>

34:22.650 --> 34:25.219
<i>You Americans</i>
<i>should understand.</i>

34:25.254 --> 34:26.788
Ours was a war
against terror.

34:26.822 --> 34:29.223
And the Markus?
They're terrorists?

34:29.257 --> 34:31.793
No matter what it looked like
to the outside world,

34:31.827 --> 34:33.226
it was the Albanians
against us.

34:33.262 --> 34:35.062
And when you withdraw
your troops,

34:35.097 --> 34:37.965
it will be them
against us again.

34:38.000 --> 34:41.068
To accuse me,
personally,

34:41.103 --> 34:43.471
for a conflict going back
hundreds of years is ridiculous.

34:43.505 --> 34:45.973
You're ridiculous.
I am not responsible.

34:46.007 --> 34:48.141
Shariq Marku thought you were
very responsible, sir.

34:48.177 --> 34:50.878
He saw your face, and he risked
his life to kill you.

34:50.913 --> 34:53.714
And when you found out
that his family was alive

34:53.748 --> 34:55.583
and that they were the only
people who could identify you,

34:55.617 --> 34:57.518
you went after Sara Marku
and Anila,

34:57.553 --> 34:59.520
the mother of your child.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.155
I loved Anila!

35:01.190 --> 35:03.324
And I love that boy!
Prove it, then! Tell us your real name!

35:03.358 --> 35:05.226
Let's see if it's on the list
of war criminals.

35:05.260 --> 35:06.861
And if it's not
on that list?

35:06.895 --> 35:10.264
Then I will be forced to let you
take Skander and go.

35:10.299 --> 35:12.767
But I need to know
your real name, sir.

35:12.801 --> 35:15.102
You are not leaving here
as Armand Marku.

35:15.137 --> 35:17.271
<i>You have one chance</i>
<i>at this, sir.</i>

35:17.306 --> 35:18.773
<i>If you give me</i>
<i>the wrong name...</i>

35:18.807 --> 35:21.108
<i>Or you improperly</i>
<i>identify yourself...</i>

35:21.143 --> 35:23.778
<i>I will immediately have you</i>
<i>deported back to Kosovo.</i>

35:23.812 --> 35:27.148
Who are you, sir?
Really?

35:35.724 --> 35:37.024
Zoran.

35:37.059 --> 35:40.561
My name
is Zoran Antonovic.

35:40.596 --> 35:44.065
Antonovic.

35:44.099 --> 35:46.033
Okay.

35:46.068 --> 35:50.338
I'm gonna go check
on that.

35:55.577 --> 35:57.078
Zoran Antonovic.

35:57.112 --> 35:58.980
<i>So you lied</i>
<i>on your marriage license.</i>

35:59.014 --> 36:02.316
<i>I used another name,</i>
<i>yes.</i>

36:02.351 --> 36:03.317
Which means
you're not legally married

36:03.352 --> 36:04.318
and you don't have privilege.

36:04.353 --> 36:07.255
Go, Buzz. Go.
<i>I had no choice.</i>

36:07.289 --> 36:08.756
Flynn,
we're in business.

36:08.790 --> 36:10.558
<i>But the vows were real.</i>

36:10.592 --> 36:12.126
<i>And the murders</i>
<i>of Anila and Sara Marku</i>

36:12.160 --> 36:14.962
after you shoved Shariq
in front of a police car?

36:14.997 --> 36:18.566
I did not <i>shove</i> Shariq
in front of a police car.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.568
I kept him
from stabbing me to death,

36:20.602 --> 36:22.403
and he was
accidentally crushed

36:22.437 --> 36:24.739
as a result
of his own barbarism.

36:24.773 --> 36:26.607
Can you not see that, huh?
Are you blind?

36:29.111 --> 36:32.179
Buzz! Over here!
Julio, open the door!

36:32.214 --> 36:34.982
All right, Buzz,
this side.

36:43.158 --> 36:45.493
I don't see anything.

36:46.995 --> 36:49.497
Well, not yet.
It could be a moment.

36:55.070 --> 36:58.673
One, two, three.

37:00.742 --> 37:04.145
I'm seeing a wiping pattern
and blood.

37:04.179 --> 37:06.147
Blood!
We got him.

37:08.850 --> 37:09.817
Agent Howard?

37:09.851 --> 37:12.286
Yeah, we got
the son of a bitch.

37:14.856 --> 37:16.524
Thank you, Lieutenant.

37:19.761 --> 37:23.898
There is
no Zoran Antonovic

37:23.932 --> 37:26.200
on any list of wanted
or suspected war criminals.

37:26.234 --> 37:28.202
As I said.

37:28.236 --> 37:30.375
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to see my wife.

37:30.376 --> 37:33.574
Your wife? Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
You're not married.

37:33.609 --> 37:35.376
Go. Go.

37:35.410 --> 37:37.812
<i>You don't have a wife.</i>

37:37.846 --> 37:40.982
- And you're under arrest for murder.
- Under arrest? What?

37:41.016 --> 37:42.817
What do you mean?
I'm not on the list.

37:42.851 --> 37:44.919
You just -- you just said
I-I wasn't on the list.

37:44.953 --> 37:46.754
Of war criminals.

37:46.788 --> 37:48.556
We found blood
in your car.

37:48.590 --> 37:50.925
And when I match that blood
to that of Anila Marku,

37:50.959 --> 37:52.727
you're gonna spend the rest of
your life in prison for murder.

37:54.396 --> 37:59.300
Sir, put your hands
behind your back.

37:59.334 --> 38:01.602
Now.

38:04.206 --> 38:07.008
I have an alibi
for these murders.

38:07.042 --> 38:09.010
Really? Like the Christmas
concert you left to attend

38:09.044 --> 38:10.478
right before you murdered
Skander's mother?

38:10.512 --> 38:11.679
My wife will confirm --

38:11.713 --> 38:12.680
and what about
after that poor boy

38:12.714 --> 38:14.015
told you
where his aunt lived?

38:14.049 --> 38:15.182
Will your wife say
she was with you

38:15.217 --> 38:16.350
during that murder,
too?

38:16.385 --> 38:17.685
And do you have
an alibi planned

38:17.719 --> 38:18.719
for after
you kill Skander?

38:18.754 --> 38:20.154
Why don't you tell it
to me now?

38:20.188 --> 38:22.556
Hmm?
Let's get it over with.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.161
Enjoy your little moment.

38:28.964 --> 38:32.233
Let's go.

38:46.415 --> 38:49.216
Hey. Hey!

38:49.251 --> 38:52.253
We're going this way.

38:53.922 --> 38:55.723
- Give me a second.
- Hey!

38:56.758 --> 38:59.260
It's time
for your little moment.

39:10.338 --> 39:11.639
Joan, I...

39:11.673 --> 39:16.277
I-I want you to know
I have always loved you.

39:16.311 --> 39:19.613
And regardless
of what you might hear,

39:19.648 --> 39:21.449
we can get through this.

39:21.483 --> 39:23.217
I know we can.

39:23.251 --> 39:26.554
And I want you
to know...

39:26.588 --> 39:28.422
I'm taking Skander home
with me.

39:28.457 --> 39:32.326
Oh. Thank God.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.994
Thank God.
Thank you, Joanie.

39:34.029 --> 39:36.630
And then I'm leaving
with the children.

39:36.665 --> 39:40.234
And you will never see any of
them again as long as you live.

39:44.773 --> 39:48.642
Joan. Joanie.

39:48.677 --> 39:51.045
Joan, wait.
Wait, please.

39:51.079 --> 39:52.046
Shut up, you freak.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.981
Joan!
What are you doing?!

39:54.015 --> 39:57.485
Joan!

40:29.279 --> 40:30.746
Brenda Leigh,
a word, please.

40:30.780 --> 40:32.381
Uh, it's important.

40:32.415 --> 40:34.849
Your mother has something
she wants to say to you.

40:34.851 --> 40:35.884
Oh?
Mama, what is it?

40:36.219 --> 40:39.621
Well, you know,
you live your whole life

40:39.656 --> 40:43.792
in a certain place,
it becomes a part of you.

40:43.826 --> 40:44.793
Food's going cold.

40:44.827 --> 40:47.429
Uh, well,
what I want to say is...

40:47.463 --> 40:49.031
We're going back
to Atlanta.

40:49.065 --> 40:51.767
Oh, daddy! No!

40:51.801 --> 40:53.802
Brenda...
Mm?

40:53.836 --> 40:55.470
You've made
a wonderful life here,

40:55.505 --> 40:57.406
with a devoted husband

40:57.440 --> 41:00.242
and some very,
very good friends.

41:00.276 --> 41:04.046
And we're just not cut out
for the Hollywood lifestyle.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.148
Well, we're --
we're disappointed.

41:06.182 --> 41:07.816
But we understand.

41:07.850 --> 41:11.153
I hate to interrupt,
uh, but it is the holiday.

41:11.187 --> 41:13.822
And any minute now we're gonna
be bombarded with suicides,

41:13.856 --> 41:16.591
and I-I don't want to see
this dinner go to waste.

41:16.626 --> 41:18.126
Amen. Excuse me.

41:18.161 --> 41:19.461
Oh, certainly.

41:19.495 --> 41:21.163
Excuse me. Willie Ray.
Uh-huh.

41:21.197 --> 41:22.998
Look, right here.
Sitting by me.

41:23.032 --> 41:24.566
Oh! Lieutenant!

41:24.600 --> 41:27.402
I understand stealing
the Christmas presents,

41:27.437 --> 41:29.338
but why did you have to take
the microwave?

41:29.372 --> 41:31.673
I had to make it look good.
L.A. is a scary place.

41:31.708 --> 41:34.009
I will send them
a brand-new microwave

41:34.043 --> 41:38.313
to their home
in Atlanta, Georgia.

41:38.348 --> 41:41.850
Now, then, who wants to
carve the turkey?

41:41.884 --> 41:43.018
Let me do it.

41:43.052 --> 41:45.687
Oh, come on!

41:45.722 --> 41:46.788
Don't worry.
I do this all day long.

41:48.558 --> 41:51.793
Okay, everybody,
um, just one second.

41:51.828 --> 41:54.731
Just say "Merry Christmas and
Happy New Year" into the camera, okay?

41:54.831 --> 41:55.945
Really?
Really? We're gonna do this.

41:55.965 --> 41:57.132
For the sake
of baby Jesus...

41:57.166 --> 41:59.534
Lieutenant!
...Can we just eat?

41:59.569 --> 42:01.670
All right, Lieutenant.
We're ready.

42:01.704 --> 42:03.105
All right, let's do it.
Here we go.

42:03.139 --> 42:07.042
On three.
One, two, three.

42:07.076 --> 42:11.380
Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year!

42:11.414 --> 42:14.716
- All right! Everybody, dig in!
- All right, Willie Ray!

42:14.751 --> 42:17.384
If anyone wants sweet potatoes,
pass your plates down.

42:17.386 --> 42:18.080
Ooh. There you go.

42:18.081 --> 42:19.607
I did the marshmallows
on those.

42:19.608 --> 42:21.911
Oh, did you?
They're kind of burnt.
