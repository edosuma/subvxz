(mellow music playing)

01:02.233 --> 01:03.900
Dorothy, your father's on the phone.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.667
Ma, Pop's been dead for 15 years.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.166
Oh, you're right. I'm getting old.
I meant, what's for dinner?

01:15.700 --> 01:16.934
Mail call.

01:17.633 --> 01:18.400
Rose.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.767
-Dorothy.
-Thank you.

01:20.834 --> 01:22.066
Here you go, Sophia.

01:22.133 --> 01:26.100
I finally got my membership card
from the Shopper's Warehouse store.

01:26.166 --> 01:28.200
Gloria at the museum shops there.

01:28.266 --> 01:30.400
But don't you have to buy everything
in large quantities?

01:30.467 --> 01:32.867
So what? They give you great bargains.

01:32.934 --> 01:37.533
If you buy 10 boxes of adult diapers,
they're only $8.00 a box.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.233
Ma, you don't wear diapers.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.934
Lots of my friends do.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.967
I'll load up now
and keep them for stocking stuffers.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.133
This is terrible.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.066
Trick move
from your checkers-by-mail partner?

01:55.333 --> 01:58.000
No.
It's from the company Charlie worked for.

01:58.066 --> 02:01.066
They've gone bankrupt
and so has their pension fund.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.767
I won't get pension checks anymore.

02:03.834 --> 02:05.834
I can't live without it.

02:05.900 --> 02:09.300
Don't panic. They can't just cut you off.

02:09.367 --> 02:11.967
She's right. There's an explanation.

02:12.033 --> 02:14.600
You'll call them tomorrow.
Everything will be fine.

02:14.667 --> 02:19.567
What if it's not?
What if I can't afford food?

02:20.066 --> 02:22.567
What if I have to sleep outside
in some park?

02:23.100 --> 02:26.600
There's an Italian saying
for times like this, <i>scappa</i>.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.166
<i>Tu si mal fortuna.</i>

02:28.233 --> 02:29.433
What does that mean?

02:29.500 --> 02:31.266
Get away from me. You're bad luck.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.333
(mellow music playing)

02:43.166 --> 02:44.867
Rose, you're home early.

02:44.934 --> 02:45.700
Yeah.

02:45.767 --> 02:47.467
I called Charlie's company today.

02:47.533 --> 02:50.567
It turns out they have a legal right
to cut off the pension.

02:50.633 --> 02:55.867
I don't make enough to live without it,
so I'm getting a new job.

02:55.934 --> 02:57.000
I'm helping her look.

02:57.066 --> 03:01.333
We're cutting out ads
that might interest her.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.000
"Single white male
seeks traveling companion.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.433
Tour of European cathedrals.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.633
No prudes."

03:14.734 --> 03:16.033
That's my pile.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.734
What a day.

03:20.800 --> 03:21.667
Look at this.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.934
Toothbrushes, 39 cents each.
I bought four gross.

03:28.633 --> 03:30.633
Anybody in the mood to remove some plaque?

03:31.367 --> 03:34.900
You have almost 600 toothbrushes.

03:34.967 --> 03:38.100
People don't use that many
in a lifetime, and at your age--

03:38.166 --> 03:41.467
I'm way ahead of you.
I bought half pink, half blue.

03:41.533 --> 03:42.400
So, after I'm gone,

03:42.467 --> 03:44.934
you and your brother
won't fight over who gets them.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.900
So that's what it feels like
to be an heiress.

03:51.934 --> 03:53.633
Don't cut up the obituaries.

03:53.700 --> 03:56.300
I want to make sure my Canasta game's
still on for tomorrow.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.533
I'm looking for a job.
They cut off Charlie's pension.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.400
He's dead. How much does he need?

04:09.266 --> 04:12.133
You know what gets me mad
about this whole thing?

04:12.200 --> 04:16.033
All those years Charlie put into that job
just for the pension.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.900
He used to say,
"Rose, I hate selling horseshoes,

04:20.367 --> 04:23.500
but if I do it long enough,
you'll be set for life."

04:26.500 --> 04:28.300
Your husband sold horseshoes?

04:28.367 --> 04:30.100
I thought he sold insurance.

04:30.166 --> 04:33.500
He did.
But Charlie wasn't very good at it.

04:33.567 --> 04:36.066
When people said no, he'd give up.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.934
Insurance salesmen have to keep going
until they get a yes.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.100
They have to keep talking,
even if people aren't listening.

04:44.166 --> 04:45.800
He should have taken you with him.

04:48.867 --> 04:52.834
Anyway, after he was fired,
he worked for an iron company.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.533
He sold other things,
but horseshoes were his specialty.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.467
He joked about it.

04:58.533 --> 05:01.300
We couldn't pass a horse
without Charlie saying,

05:01.367 --> 05:03.567
"Can I show you something in an oxford?"

05:05.533 --> 05:08.734
Ah, then he'd laugh, and I'd laugh.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.734
Sometimes even the horse would laugh.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.700
-With them or at them?
-Ma.

05:17.667 --> 05:20.333
You should call what's-his-name.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.800
Ma, could you narrow that down a bit.

05:28.033 --> 05:31.633
The newscaster who glues his head
to the ceiling.

05:32.333 --> 05:36.734
I think she means that consumer reporter
on channel 8, Enrique Mas.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.800
-That's the guy.
-That's a good idea.

05:39.867 --> 05:41.100
He helps lots of people.

05:41.166 --> 05:44.300
I believe he's the best
consumer reporter ever.

05:44.367 --> 05:46.433
You're a fan?

05:46.500 --> 05:50.233
Oh, yes.
He's a great champion of the people.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.266
Besides, he has gorgeous black hair

05:54.300 --> 05:58.367
and those swarthy Latin good looks
and the sexy way he rolls his Rs.

05:58.433 --> 05:59.800
En-r-r-r-ique.

06:01.333 --> 06:05.133
Boy, I'd love to get him on a couch
made out of Corinthian leather.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.600
The woman has such lofty ambitions.

06:14.433 --> 06:17.867
Thanks for the suggestion, Sophia,
but there's nothing Enrique can do.

06:17.934 --> 06:20.367
They have the legal right
to cut off the pension.

06:21.066 --> 06:24.734
Tomorrow I'll start looking for a job.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.333
Dress youthfully.

06:26.800 --> 06:27.800
How come?

06:27.867 --> 06:28.767
You're old.

06:37.734 --> 06:39.100
Let's face it, honey.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.867
Companies aren't falling over themselves
to hire women your age.

06:42.934 --> 06:46.433
Why don't people like to hire older women?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.834
Probably makes them feel uncomfortable,

06:49.300 --> 06:51.767
like they're bossing their mothers around.

06:51.834 --> 06:52.567
"Ma, stop that!"

06:58.166 --> 06:59.333
It's understandable.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.867
(mellow music playing)

07:07.033 --> 07:10.266
Pussycat, can you lend me $20?

07:11.467 --> 07:14.367
This is the second time this week
you've come for money.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.033
What happened to your allowance?

07:16.100 --> 07:17.433
A medical emergency has come up.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.533
Can I have the money?

07:19.600 --> 07:21.800
What medical... Ma, what's wrong?

07:21.867 --> 07:23.066
I think I'm pregnant.

07:28.934 --> 07:31.066
What happened, the rabbit died laughing?

07:33.934 --> 07:35.667
What do you need the money for?

07:35.734 --> 07:37.967
They're having a special
at Shopper's Warehouse.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.967
-It's something I really need.
-What?

07:40.033 --> 07:41.066
Tube socks.

07:43.900 --> 07:47.300
This is how Imelda Marcos started
with that shoe thing.

07:49.533 --> 07:51.600
What is going on?

07:52.166 --> 07:53.934
I don't know. It makes me feel good.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.100
Shopping there makes you feel immortal.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.100
I don't follow.

07:58.166 --> 08:01.900
Let's say you buy 20 cases of sardines.

08:01.967 --> 08:04.000
This better be just an example.

08:05.567 --> 08:06.500
Of course.

08:07.133 --> 08:09.800
You get 20 cases of sardines, you figure,

08:09.867 --> 08:12.233
God doesn't want me to waste
good sardines.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.467
He's gonna wait
till I finish the 20 cases.

08:14.533 --> 08:17.133
That could take 5, 6 years.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.800
Why couldn't you just eat one case slowly?

08:20.266 --> 08:21.600
Silly, isn't it?

08:24.033 --> 08:26.600
What in the hell are those sardines
doing in the kitchen?

08:26.667 --> 08:28.266
Ma!

08:34.734 --> 08:35.800
Wait till you're my age.

08:35.867 --> 08:38.066
We'll see what kind of straws
you clutch at.

08:42.066 --> 08:43.967
Hi, honey, how'd it go?

08:44.033 --> 08:45.300
Not so good.

08:45.367 --> 08:49.233
I looked all day and came up with nothing.

08:49.300 --> 08:51.767
Come on, sit down.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.934
Can I get you a sardine sandwich?

08:56.633 --> 08:57.533
Maybe later.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.300
I knew it would be rough,
but not this rough.

09:02.367 --> 09:03.834
You didn't find anything?

09:03.900 --> 09:05.600
I found one I wanted.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.467
I would've been perfect.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.433
But they said I was too old.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.467
What job?

09:10.533 --> 09:12.500
Pet store assistant manager.

09:13.066 --> 09:14.667
I don't know why they didn't hire me.

09:14.734 --> 09:18.066
I worked in one in St. Olaf for 10 years.

09:18.500 --> 09:22.533
I was the one who thought up
big squeaky toys for cows.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.367
You didn't tell them that, did you, Rose?

09:30.834 --> 09:35.600
Before I could tell them,
they told me I was too old.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.333
They can't do that.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.266
That is age discrimination.

09:39.734 --> 09:41.133
Rose, you can fight this.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.934
I don't want to make a fuss.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.200
Then call Enrique Mas.
Let him fuss for you right on television.

09:49.266 --> 09:50.967
Stand up for your rights, Rose.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.533
-Maybe I'll call.
-Rose!

09:53.767 --> 09:56.100
Well, I just feel overwhelmed.

09:56.166 --> 09:58.266
How could this have happened?

09:58.333 --> 10:00.700
We were so careful with our money.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.533
We saved. We never splurged.

10:03.967 --> 10:07.900
Okay, one year we went to Chicago
to tour the stockyards.

10:10.633 --> 10:14.333
But it was our 20th anniversary.
We had a romantic trip coming.

10:16.100 --> 10:18.834
You must have been the envy
of every woman in St. Olaf.

10:19.967 --> 10:24.233
It was more than the stockyards.
We saw where Crisco is made.

10:26.934 --> 10:32.533
The point is, we thought I'd have
enough money for the rest of my life.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.967
Now, the reality is I probably have enough
for only a couple months.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.600
What's with the sardines?

10:47.066 --> 10:49.867
How will we get rid of all this?

10:49.934 --> 10:52.900
Don't worry. Tomorrow we're getting
five cases of pickled onions.

10:54.734 --> 10:57.867
Life sure has a way
of throwing you curveballs.

10:58.533 --> 11:02.200
I never would've imagined
I'd be worrying about money

11:02.266 --> 11:03.633
at this stage in my life.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.300
I used to think stan would care for me.

11:06.834 --> 11:11.033
We didn't save much,
but he was a good novelty salesman.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.700
It sounds naive now
that I placed my hopes for the future

11:14.767 --> 11:18.266
on a bald pinhead
with the morals of a maggot

11:18.333 --> 11:21.433
who made his living
selling plastic dog doo.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.333
(sighs)

11:28.033 --> 11:29.800
Well, at least I'm not bitter.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.734
I always assumed
I'd be kept by a younger man.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.600
It's not too late.
They get younger every day.

11:44.033 --> 11:48.066
What can I do?
How much longer can I pay the rent?

11:48.734 --> 11:50.000
I can't live here.

11:50.066 --> 11:51.667
I won't hear this.

11:51.734 --> 11:55.266
You will call Enrique Mas
and get that job you deserve.

11:55.333 --> 11:58.166
And you will stay here.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.700
She's right. You have to fight this.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.200
Every morning, when I leave the house,

12:04.633 --> 12:09.533
I see this bag lady going through
the garbage over on 135th street.

12:10.133 --> 12:13.734
She has everything she owns
piled in one of those old shopping carts.

12:15.433 --> 12:18.166
Well, the other day, for the first time,

12:18.233 --> 12:21.433
I noticed she's about our age.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.834
You always feel sorry
for someone like that.

12:24.900 --> 12:29.900
But I wondered, what did she do
to get herself into a fix like that?

12:30.400 --> 12:32.100
I thought, well, she must be lazy.

12:32.967 --> 12:36.266
Or she must be pretty stupid
to let something like this happen to her.

12:38.066 --> 12:39.300
But the truth is...

12:40.834 --> 12:41.900
She's me.

12:43.867 --> 12:45.266
God, what am I going to do?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.834
(somber music playing)

12:52.600 --> 12:56.367
(quirky music playing)

13:03.266 --> 13:04.667
(phone ringing)

13:09.300 --> 13:10.500
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.100
-Can I help you?
-Rose Nylund to see Terry Franco.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.667
-Hi, Mrs. Nylund. I'm Terry.
-Hi.

13:17.233 --> 13:20.367
It's nice of Mr. Mas to see me so soon.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.900
Maybe you misunderstood.
I'll be helping you.

13:23.967 --> 13:26.300
Enrique will get involved

13:26.367 --> 13:29.100
only if your age discrimination case
gets really ugly

13:29.166 --> 13:33.100
and the company tries to discredit you
and make you look stupid.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.266
I guess we can only hope.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.133
(chuckles)

13:38.867 --> 13:41.967
Okay, I'll need to get
some information from you.

13:42.033 --> 13:45.667
Any applicants for production assistant
coming today?

13:45.734 --> 13:46.967
They'll be here at 2:00.

13:47.033 --> 13:47.700
Hi.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.900
How do you do, madam?

13:49.967 --> 13:52.000
I am Enrique Mas.

13:53.667 --> 13:57.000
Mrs. Nylund is here
on an age discrimination complaint.

13:57.467 --> 13:59.633
I will try very hard to help you.

13:59.700 --> 14:00.934
Could I ask something?

14:01.000 --> 14:04.066
You said you were hiring
a production assistant.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.233
Could I apply for that?

14:06.600 --> 14:10.834
I'm a fan, and I respect your work.
I'd be terrific.

14:10.900 --> 14:12.567
I'm sorry.

14:12.834 --> 14:15.100
I'm afraid you're just not the right type.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.600
The job requires someone
with great energy and drive.

14:17.667 --> 14:21.200
And quite frankly,
someone of your advanced age...

14:21.867 --> 14:22.734
Wait a minute.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.400
I'm here about age discrimination.
You're saying I'm too old?

14:26.467 --> 14:27.667
It is not me.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.433
It is En-r-r-r-ique Mas.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.200
I'm confused.

14:33.266 --> 14:34.533
Please, let me explain.

14:36.467 --> 14:39.433
You see, there are two mes.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.233
There is Enrique Mas,
the dedicated consumer advocate,

14:42.300 --> 14:44.300
fighting for justice and equality.

14:44.667 --> 14:45.900
And then there is...

14:46.934 --> 14:48.400
En-r-r-r-ique Mas,

14:48.467 --> 14:51.400
the television personality
who wants out of this local station

14:51.467 --> 14:55.233
and on to the network
to become a big fish in a big pond.

14:57.033 --> 14:59.600
It is Enrique who has reservations.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.200
I can't believe it. You're a fake.

15:03.266 --> 15:04.533
I'm not a fake.

15:05.900 --> 15:09.233
Since I was little boy,
I wanted to be on TV.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.967
That's not easy for a Hispanic kid.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.767
Who were my role models?

15:14.266 --> 15:15.734
Zorro and Ricky Ricardo.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.567
A gay caballero
and a man who couldn't recognize his wife

15:20.633 --> 15:21.467
in a fake mustache.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.734
I swore if I ever got on TV,
I'd maintain the highest standards.

15:27.800 --> 15:30.166
Enrique Mas demands the best.

15:31.934 --> 15:33.867
Well, hold it right there.

15:33.934 --> 15:37.600
You can't write me off
just because I'm not 30-something.

15:37.867 --> 15:42.767
I have experience and...
and wisdom and insight.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.433
I'd be perfect for this job.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.700
You see, I am the battered consumer.

15:48.600 --> 15:50.934
I drive a gremlin, for God's sake!

15:55.633 --> 15:56.767
I'll tell you what I'll do.

15:57.533 --> 15:58.500
Will you accept a test?

15:58.567 --> 15:59.633
You bet.

16:00.934 --> 16:04.233
One of the most important parts
of this job is product testing.

16:04.300 --> 16:08.667
I will give you a test to do at home.

16:08.734 --> 16:09.900
But I must warn you,

16:09.967 --> 16:15.100
Enrique Mas demands that the results
be accurate in every detail.

16:15.166 --> 16:17.567
Thank you very much, Mr. Mas.

16:17.633 --> 16:19.900
You can call me En-r-r-r-ique.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.100
No, I don't think I can.

16:23.367 --> 16:26.367
(light music playing)

16:30.934 --> 16:33.667
I don't know how to thank you
for helping me.

16:33.734 --> 16:34.967
-Pay us.
-(Dorothy) Ma!

16:36.467 --> 16:38.133
It's our pleasure, Rose.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.333
Okay, what we have to do is try
these different hair removal products,

16:42.400 --> 16:45.100
evaluate their advantages
and disadvantages,

16:45.166 --> 16:47.400
and see which gets our legs the smoothest.

16:47.467 --> 16:49.967
Sophia, try the regular razor.

16:50.033 --> 16:52.133
Dorothy, would you try this?

16:52.200 --> 16:53.066
What is it?

16:53.600 --> 16:58.433
That wire vibrates, and it whisks
hair away from below the skin line.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.433
I don't know whether I want to.
It says it's going to hurt.

17:04.834 --> 17:08.734
You can try it on your right leg,
then use hot wax on your left one.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.967
Why don't we just set each other on fire?

17:19.667 --> 17:21.967
-Dorothy.
-All right. All right.

17:22.033 --> 17:24.133
Did they send a bullet to bite on?

17:25.333 --> 17:26.800
Your choice, Blanche.

17:26.867 --> 17:29.233
Razor or cream remover?

17:29.300 --> 17:30.166
Cheesecake.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.633
This reminds me
of the first time I shaved.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.233
It was at a slumber party when I was 11.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.967
What's a party without snacks?

17:39.033 --> 17:42.400
Instead of cheesecake,
let's have oatmeal cookies.

17:42.467 --> 17:43.333
Why?

17:43.400 --> 17:45.367
Because we have so many of them.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.166
Ma, you didn't.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.100
I did.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.400
That's it, that's it. No more.

17:53.467 --> 17:58.433
I know that shopping at Shopper's
Warehouse is a religious experience,

17:58.500 --> 18:01.300
but I forbid you to go there again.

18:01.367 --> 18:02.600
All right, all right.

18:02.667 --> 18:04.066
Does this mean no cookies?

18:04.133 --> 18:06.567
Well, as long as we own them...

18:08.667 --> 18:12.367
Did you really start shaving at 11?

18:12.433 --> 18:14.400
I did it on a dare.

18:14.467 --> 18:15.900
Where I come from,

18:15.967 --> 18:18.333
everybody thought
once you started shaving your legs,

18:18.400 --> 18:19.633
why, you'd become loose.

18:19.700 --> 18:20.867
So, I shaved them.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.500
What happened?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.133
It was a wives' tale.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.800
I wasn't loose
for another year and a half.

18:32.967 --> 18:35.266
I remember when I started shaving.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.100
I was 13, and I wanted to shave

18:38.166 --> 18:40.834
because I was going to a movie
with Alan Steckler.

18:40.900 --> 18:41.633
You remember him, Ma?

18:41.700 --> 18:43.467
Small head. Enormous lips.

18:45.533 --> 18:49.700
Ma told me once I started shaving,

18:49.767 --> 18:54.266
I'd regret it the rest of my life
because my legs would have bristles.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.867
When you were 16,
I could grate cheese on your knees.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.800
When did you start, Sophia?

19:04.867 --> 19:07.333
Not till I came to this country.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.934
In my village,
hairy legs were a sign of beauty.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.567
How do you account for that?

19:12.967 --> 19:14.800
Dumb men, hairy women.

19:18.934 --> 19:21.500
That's not such a big surprise.

19:21.567 --> 19:24.834
A lot of European girls
don't shave under their arms.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.166
Is that true?

19:26.233 --> 19:27.734
They just let it all hang out.

19:29.333 --> 19:30.300
Really?

19:30.367 --> 19:31.834
Bushy as can be.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.166
What do they look like
in strapless dresses?

19:35.233 --> 19:37.300
Like Milton Berle, Rose.

19:40.367 --> 19:43.567
Nothing's wrong with it.
It's perfectly natural.

19:43.633 --> 19:45.834
Too natural if you ask me.

19:45.900 --> 19:50.934
I prefer to be smooth under my arms
and from my ankle to my thigh.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.300
Get out of here.

19:53.533 --> 19:54.200
What?

19:55.200 --> 19:57.166
You shave above the knee?

19:57.600 --> 19:58.567
Of course.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.033
Get out of here.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.100
(chuckles)

20:02.600 --> 20:05.667
Surely, you've heard of women
shaving above the knee.

20:08.734 --> 20:10.433
Get out of here.

20:11.266 --> 20:13.900
Say that one more time and we will.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.400
I never heard of that.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.934
When men see that,
what does that say to them?

20:21.967 --> 20:23.900
Hopefully it says, "Touch my leg."

20:25.834 --> 20:29.200
In case they miss the tattoo
that says the same thing.

20:32.934 --> 20:36.200
My mother would kill me if I did that.

20:36.266 --> 20:38.200
She never wanted me to shave.

20:38.600 --> 20:43.266
In high school, the kids made up
this mean nickname for me

20:43.333 --> 20:45.033
because I had hairy legs.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.233
What?

20:46.300 --> 20:48.300
"Rose with the hairy legs."

20:51.367 --> 20:53.066
Kids can be so cruel.

20:53.900 --> 20:56.867
(dreamy music playing)

21:00.100 --> 21:01.633
Well, it's almost dinnertime.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.533
What can be taking Rose so long
at that job interview?

21:04.600 --> 21:08.467
If she's taking long, that's good.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.500
How long does it take to say no?

21:10.567 --> 21:12.967
Why are you asking her?
She's never said no in her life.

21:16.934 --> 21:20.800
Just to be safe, when she gets home,
we shouldn't ask what happened.

21:20.867 --> 21:23.734
Let's keep the conversation positive.

21:23.800 --> 21:25.934
Good point.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.233
She might be devastated.

21:28.633 --> 21:30.233
So, no matter how bad the news,

21:30.300 --> 21:33.300
let's smile
and show her that we believe in her.

21:33.367 --> 21:34.166
-Yeah.
-(door opens)

21:34.767 --> 21:35.834
Guess what.

21:36.300 --> 21:38.533
(all) Aw...

21:39.900 --> 21:42.400
No, I got the job!

21:43.000 --> 21:45.433
-Rose!
-That's wonderful!

21:45.500 --> 21:46.667
I don't know how to thank you.

21:46.734 --> 21:51.567
Enrique Mas said my report was accurate,
concise, and very professional.

21:51.633 --> 21:52.667
Oh, it's so exciting.

21:52.734 --> 21:55.400
Tomorrow I compare artificial sweeteners,

21:55.467 --> 21:58.367
and next week,
I get to test crash helmets.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.533
You'll leave us out of that one,
won't you?

22:04.033 --> 22:06.533
That's wonderful, honey.
That's just wonderful.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.433
You know what the best part is?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.333
I get to stay here.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.767
That worried me the most.

22:11.834 --> 22:16.233
I knew I'd wind up on my feet.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.734
But what worried me

22:17.800 --> 22:21.266
was that I'd have to leave my friends
and my family.

22:21.333 --> 22:25.000
Oh, honey. It scared me, too.

22:25.066 --> 22:27.767
Okay, okay, everybody, get washed up.

22:29.367 --> 22:33.066
Rose, I knew you'd get that job,
so I made a special dinner to celebrate.

22:33.133 --> 22:34.934
Sophia, that's so nice.

22:34.967 --> 22:35.867
Don't mention it.

22:35.934 --> 22:38.767
Shaving last night
really made me feel good.

22:38.834 --> 22:40.633
That you were helping Rose.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.433
That I can still touch my ankles.

22:45.934 --> 22:47.767
What did you make that's so special?

22:47.834 --> 22:51.700
Sardine casserole
with a kind of an oatmeal cookie crust.

22:54.567 --> 22:55.633
I hope you'll like it.

22:55.700 --> 22:56.633
There's a lot.

22:57.633 --> 23:00.633
(lively music playing)

23:04.400 --> 23:07.400
(closing theme music playing)
