Good morning, Comrade Santos.

Good morning, comrades.

My name is...
Good morning, Señor Voroshevski.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.915
- Aren't you going to attend the trial?
- No. My credentials are not in order.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.278
- And I wouldn't be surprised if yours aren't.
- Absurd!

04:06.400 --> 04:10.075
<i>Manuel Silva. Diário de Notícias, Lisbon.</i>

04:11.120 --> 04:12.917
Credentials not in order.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.956
So sorry.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.749
Just a minute. I am an accredited
correspondent the same as the others.

04:18.839 --> 04:21.718
To file complaint,
consult Bureau of Enlightenment.

04:21.800 --> 04:27.591
Is there something you don't want me to see?
What sort of trial is this?

04:29.680 --> 04:31.910
- Why won't they admit them?
- I wonder.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.753
All these precautions, these soldiers...

04:34.840 --> 04:37.274
Is this to be a military trial?

04:37.360 --> 04:40.397
How can it be? This is a civil court.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.789
I can tell better when I see the judges.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.714
"You are invited to represent your newspaper
at a most important hearing

04:46.800 --> 04:49.314
in the Tokyo district court."

04:49.400 --> 04:52.949
"Invited."
I was picked up yesterday by the police,

04:53.040 --> 04:56.555
examined for two hours,
and last night my rooms were searched.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.074
- So were mine.
- And mine.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.913
I knew it when I found
the plumbing was out of order.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.471
You'd think they'd know that I wouldn't plug
my own drainpipe with secret documents.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.632
It happened to all of us.
You should not be offended.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.315
Toma's right. After all,
we must remember that Japan is at war.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.754
General Mitsubi.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.631
Admiral Yamagichi.
Commander of the Imperial Fleet.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.672
The judges of this court
will now exercise their powers

05:56.760 --> 05:59.957
according to law in the name of the emperor.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.235
Up! Stand!

06:12.760 --> 06:14.557
Toyama.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.234
- Who is it?
- Mitsuru Toyama.

06:18.320 --> 06:24.316
The greatest political power in the empire.
He's the head of the Black Dragon Society.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.440
You have prepared all evidence?

06:34.520 --> 06:36.511
Yes, Excellency.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.194
All witnesses are present?

06:58.960 --> 07:00.837
All witnesses are present.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.593
Have the defendants
brought into the courtroom.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.949
The prisoners will respond as...

07:53.040 --> 07:56.157
Hats off! Hats off!

08:02.960 --> 08:06.509
The prisoners will respond
as their names are called.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.194
Captain Harvey Ross.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.599
Captain Ross.

08:11.680 --> 08:14.035

08:43.320 --> 08:44.992
Lieutenant Greenbaum.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.469
Sergeant Howard Clinton.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.918
Sergeant Clinton.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.514
You may be seated.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.869
If it isn't asking too much, sir,
we'd like to know what this is about.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.520
- You wish to make inquiries?
- Yes, I do.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.828
Speak.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.957
- Are we being put on trial?
- That is correct.

09:15.040 --> 09:19.716
- On what charge?
- You will be informed in due time.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.828
Excuse my ignorance, but back home if
we were on trial, we'd be entitled to a lawyer.

09:24.920 --> 09:28.230
You will have adequate counsel
to defend you.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.595
Thank you, sir.

09:31.680 --> 09:35.753
Oh, yeah. We'd appreciate someone
from the Swiss legation or the Red Cross.

09:35.840 --> 09:40.311
Your counsel
has already been appointed by the court.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.070
Itsubi Sakai.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.431
You may have a brief conference
with the defendants.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.309
My name is Sakai. Princeton, class of '31.

09:59.400 --> 10:04.474
My name is Greenbaum.
City College of New York, class of '39.

10:04.560 --> 10:09.076
- Sir, may I say something to the court?
- Go ahead, Greenie. We're all in this together.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.390
Do you mind?

10:11.480 --> 10:15.029
- Your Honour, I object.
- Speak.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.156
I've had some experience with law,

10:17.240 --> 10:21.711
and I know that no civil court in the world
has any jurisdiction over prisoners of war.

10:21.800 --> 10:25.031
I refer you to the Geneva Treaty, and I quote:

10:26.120 --> 10:28.839
"Combatants captured
are entitled to that protection

10:28.920 --> 10:31.593
which their own state
is unable to afford them."

10:31.680 --> 10:35.719
"Their lives, ceasing to be jura publica
under the dominion of belligerency,

10:35.800 --> 10:41.591
have become jura universalia from one point
of view, and jura privata from another."

10:41.680 --> 10:45.559
"Thus, by a double portal,
they re-enter the sphere of normal relations."

10:45.640 --> 10:48.552
"Though separated
from any political community,

10:48.640 --> 10:52.189
they once more belong
to humanity and to themselves."

10:52.280 --> 10:56.592
"And as of their lives, so of their liberties."

10:56.680 --> 11:02.516
"It is of their combatant liberty alone
that belligerency can dispose."

11:02.600 --> 11:06.832
So you see, Your Honour,
you can't try us in a civil court,

11:06.920 --> 11:10.913
and I therefore move the charges
be dismissed, whatever they are.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.072
He's right.
This court has no jurisdiction over them.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.551
The crime of which you are guilty
is a violation of international law.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.679
The emperor's government finds no basis
on which you may seek immunity

11:22.760 --> 11:24.671
under the Articles of War.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.718
The procurator will read the indictment.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.468
"Whereas the defendants have been identified

11:39.560 --> 11:43.155
as members of the armed forces
of the United States of America,

11:43.240 --> 11:46.550
an enemy with which
the Japanese Empire is at war,

11:46.640 --> 11:51.270
and whereas on the 18th day of April
in the year of 1942,

11:51.360 --> 11:53.999
the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama,

11:54.080 --> 11:58.392
Nagoya, Kobe and Osaka
were bombed by enemy aircraft."

11:58.480 --> 12:02.712
"Whereas the above-mentioned members
of the armed forces of the United States,

12:02.800 --> 12:07.271
while bombing the above-mentioned cities,
diverted from military objectives

12:07.360 --> 12:10.193
and dropped bombs
upon non-military installations,

12:10.280 --> 12:13.670
such as schools,
hospitals and temples of worship."

12:13.760 --> 12:14.909
This is false.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.309
"And whereas they flew at low altitudes

12:17.400 --> 12:21.359
and directed machine-gun fire into
crowds killing women and children."

12:21.440 --> 12:23.556
Brutality! Brutality!

12:23.640 --> 12:28.077
"Therefore, the emperor's government
demands the conviction of the defendants

12:28.160 --> 12:29.912
for the crime of murder."

12:30.000 --> 12:31.956
What do you mean? Murder?

12:32.040 --> 12:36.033
- We never machine-gunned anybody.
- Level off!

12:39.640 --> 12:42.757
We'll speak our piece when the time comes.

12:42.840 --> 12:45.229
Summon the first witness.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.390
Yuen Chiu Ling.

13:16.440 --> 13:21.673
I affirm that, according to my conscience,
I will speak the truth,

13:21.760 --> 13:26.038
adding nothing and concealing nothing.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.228
- Your name?
- Yuen Chiu Ling.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.675
- Your nationality?
- Chinese.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.433
- Where is your home?
- Kunwong.

13:43.520 --> 13:48.036
- You hold an official position there?
- I'm governor of Kunwong province.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.714
Where were you
on the day the bombing took place?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.313
At my home.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.188
Did you see
any of the defendants on that date?

13:57.440 --> 13:59.476
Yes, Excellency.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.994
Describe the circumstances.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.640
I learned of the bombing over my radio.

14:04.720 --> 14:08.315
The first reports
were confusing and contradictory

14:08.400 --> 14:13.269
as to the number of planes involved
and the amount of damage caused.

14:13.360 --> 14:16.750
As night approached, Tokyo radio warned

14:16.840 --> 14:21.197
that the American planes
were believed headed across China.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.473
Still later, other reports claimed

14:24.560 --> 14:29.031
the storm was forcing
many of the planes down.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.875
One of them was reported
to have crashed in the mountains.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.078
Another was believed
to have fallen into the sea.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.435
Then it was reported

14:40.520 --> 14:46.311
one of the planes
was in the vicinity of Kunwong.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.149
Pilot to navigator. Pilot to navigator.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.435
Navigator to pilot. Go ahead, pilot.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.431
<i>How we doing, Greenie?</i>

15:36.520 --> 15:41.355
Wind velocity has altered.
Better compensate to 264. Will we make it?

15:46.720 --> 15:49.871
Not a chance.

15:49.960 --> 15:55.717
<i>Prepare to abandon ship. We'll try to get
above this weather to give us a better break.</i>

15:56.400 --> 15:58.868
That's an order.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.117
Roger.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.398
<i>- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.</i>

16:11.480 --> 16:16.076
All men come forward with your chutes.
We'll ditch it from the forward escape hatch.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.957
Roger.

16:21.640 --> 16:25.315
- Go ahead. I'll set the automatic.
- Right.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.354
- Any idea where we are, Greenie?
- Over China.

16:32.440 --> 16:36.319
Splendid.
That narrows things down considerably.

16:36.400 --> 16:41.315
Well, men, if anything happens to me,
Lieutenant Vincent is in command.

16:45.880 --> 16:49.714
I've set the ship on a circular course
so she won't be far when she hits.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.634
If she burns when she crashes,
we'll see the flames and we'll meet there.

16:53.720 --> 16:57.679
If she doesn't burn, every man look for her
and whoever finds her, burn her.

16:57.760 --> 17:02.550
She mustn't fall into Japanese hands, and
the rest of us can use the fire as a beacon.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.279
OK, boys, this is the end of the line.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.828
Open her up, Greenie.

18:38.840 --> 18:43.072
Time to get up, skipper.
We've arrived. Are you hurt?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.469
I don't know yet.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.632
OK?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.711
I think so.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.676
- Nothing broken as far as I can tell.
- You scared the pants off me.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.638
I was beginning to think
you meant that speech you made.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.757
- Have you seen the others?
- I've seen nothing but mud.

19:10.720 --> 19:14.554
<i>Mrs Murphy sounds like she's getting ready.</i>

19:22.520 --> 19:24.431
Hey, skipper!

19:24.520 --> 19:27.080
Captain Ross, sir!

19:27.160 --> 19:29.196
It's me - Greenie!

19:29.280 --> 19:33.068
Hey! Hey, Greenie! It's me - Clint!

19:33.160 --> 19:35.958
Clinton! Hey, it's me!

19:36.040 --> 19:38.508
It's me - Greenie!

19:38.960 --> 19:41.349
Greenie! Hey!

19:42.840 --> 19:45.832
Over this way! Hey! Hey, Greenie!

19:48.400 --> 19:51.073
- Hey, Greenie.
- Hiya, Clint!

19:51.160 --> 19:54.038
Gee, Clint, I'm sure glad
to see you're all in one piece.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.190
Oh, gee, Greenie, I'm glad you're here.

19:56.280 --> 19:59.670
- Hey, what'd you fall into?
- What did you?

19:59.760 --> 20:01.910
Must be some kind of mud.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.788
Call it mud if you like, but you
needn't be polite. We're in a rice field.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.509
I'll never touch the stuff again
as long as I live, even with raisins.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.909
<i>It's Mrs Murphy.</i>

20:18.920 --> 20:22.435
<i>- Who goes there?
- Hey, Clint, it's the skipper!</i>

20:24.920 --> 20:29.471
Hey, no reflection on you, Vincent, but I'm
sure glad we've still got the same skipper.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.198
- So am I.
- So am I, sir.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.635
Thanks, fellas. So am I.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.996
<i>That's too bad.
Mrs Murphy kept a good house.</i>

20:37.080 --> 20:41.312
How about moving away from this fire?
This place may be crawling with Japs.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.832
If you're coming out,
come out with your hands up.

21:03.920 --> 21:06.036
Who are you?

21:08.160 --> 21:10.594
<i>- It's Georgia Tech!
- Bayforth!</i>

21:10.680 --> 21:13.240
<i>Bayforth!</i>

21:25.960 --> 21:29.191
- What happened to your ship?
- I crashed her in the goo.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.397
- Did you burn her?
- I didn't have to. She sunk out of sight.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.119
Burke was killed.

21:39.120 --> 21:42.112
Please, forgive the intrusion, gentlemen.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.397
It is not safe to stay here.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.594
- You haven't introduced us to your friends.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:12.680 --> 22:17.310
I'm Yuen Chiu Ling,
governor of Kunwong province.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.472
This is my son Moy.

22:20.560 --> 22:23.518
- How do you do?
- How do you do, gentlemen?

22:23.600 --> 22:26.114
I'm glad to know you.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.314
Where'd you pick him up?

22:28.400 --> 22:32.871
Oh, he picked us up down the road.
He said he was out looking for us.

22:33.720 --> 22:39.192
All China is grateful to you
for the blow at Tokyo, Captain.

22:39.280 --> 22:40.633
How do you know that?

22:40.720 --> 22:44.508
Tokyo radio has talked
of nothing else all day.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.477
How did we do? Was there much damage?

22:46.560 --> 22:49.472
One moment they announce, "No damage",

22:49.560 --> 22:54.156
the next they say,
"Fires are raging out of control."

22:54.240 --> 22:57.516
First they say there were no casualties,

22:57.600 --> 23:03.038
then they estimate
casualties may exceed 4,000.

23:03.480 --> 23:05.516
We put the fear of God into them.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.068
The Japanese do not fear God.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.799
They fear only bombs.

23:11.800 --> 23:16.430
No doubt, Captain, you have
a secret base you are trying to reach,

23:16.520 --> 23:19.159
and perhaps I can guide you.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.959
That's very kind,
but we can't say where we're going

23:22.040 --> 23:25.396
any more than we can say
where we came from. Those are our orders.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.870
A million pardons.
I should not have asked.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.190
It was stupid of me.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.755
- May I make a suggestion, Captain?
- What?

23:35.840 --> 23:39.276
Perhaps His Honour
will lend us the station wagon.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.559
My humble car is at your disposal.

23:42.640 --> 23:44.835
You have done much for China,

23:44.920 --> 23:48.196
but the Japanese patrols are all around us.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.714
You must not travel in these clothes.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.633
You expose yourselves to much danger.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.109
And you must eat and rest.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.316
My house is not far.

24:03.320 --> 24:08.440
My son joins me
in urging you to accept our invitation.

24:10.720 --> 24:16.352
OK. We'll take a chance. If you're on the level,
we'll never know how to thank you enough.

24:16.440 --> 24:19.591
But if you cross us,
we'll certainly know how to kill you.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.193
As Your Excellencies can see,

24:29.280 --> 24:34.070
my guests found no method
of carrying out their promise.

24:34.160 --> 24:37.550
I am still in excellent health.

24:38.840 --> 24:41.991
The court is particularly interested
in any conversations

24:42.080 --> 24:44.799
in which the defendants
mentioned the targets.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.519
Yes, Excellency.

24:47.600 --> 24:50.797
Mistaking me for a possible accomplice,

24:50.880 --> 24:56.796
these men were in a boisterous
and a boastful mood.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.316
They laughed as they told me
how they machine-gunned children

25:00.400 --> 25:02.436
at play in a schoolyard,

25:02.520 --> 25:06.479
and how they destroyed
hospital after hospital

25:06.560 --> 25:08.869
and temple after temple.

25:08.960 --> 25:13.112
The court can well imagine
how contemptible I felt

25:13.200 --> 25:16.636
having these monsters share my table,

25:16.720 --> 25:23.034
even if it was only for the purpose of
detaining them until Japanese troops arrived.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.997
Brutality! Brutality! Brutality!

25:25.080 --> 25:30.438
He is a liar. We said we hit our targets, but
they weren't hospitals, temples or schools.

25:30.520 --> 25:34.149
They were oil-storage centres,
airports and shipyards.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.549
That's what we hit. That's what we told him.

25:36.640 --> 25:40.918
Excellencies, my son was present at all times.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.992
He will gladly corroborate my statements

25:44.080 --> 25:49.871
if Your Excellencies think it is necessary.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.873
The court has no cause
to suspect the witness of perjury.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.349
You may step down.

25:58.120 --> 26:02.238
Hey, just a minute here.
We got a right to cross-examine...

26:02.320 --> 26:05.392
Get that liar back.
Work on that guy. Break him down.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.517
Our law does not permit cross-examination,

26:08.600 --> 26:11.831
unless the court suspects
the witness did not tell the truth.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.832
- But the witness...
- Look, look. What's the use?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.309
This is a lynching.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.549
General Ito Mitsubi.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.996
I affirm that I will speak the truth,
adding nothing and concealing nothing.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.192
Your name and rank?

26:45.280 --> 26:49.034
Ito Mitsubi,
general in command of military intelligence.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.556
Following the bombings,
did your department photograph

26:52.640 --> 26:58.590
the result of the attacks
on Tokyo, Nagoya, Kobe and Osaka?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.033
It did.

27:00.120 --> 27:05.319
Specifically, did you prepare
motion pictures showing civilian casualties?

27:05.400 --> 27:08.710
- Yes, Excellency.
- Are you ready to display them to the court?

27:08.800 --> 27:10.791
Yes, Excellency.

27:23.440 --> 27:28.878
This is where the American bombs fell
in Mizu Street in Yokohama.

27:31.040 --> 27:36.797
The court will notice the wreckage of the
Daijingu shrine and many civilian casualties.

27:39.280 --> 27:43.956
Here, you see the result of bombing
and machine-gunning in Nagoya.

27:44.040 --> 27:46.031
- That's not a real air raid.
- Be still.

27:46.120 --> 27:51.035
800 civilian casualties,
and the Buddhist temple of Eihoji destroyed.

27:51.120 --> 27:54.715
Those pictures were made
in an air-raid drill before Japan was at war.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.075
- You know. We were there.
- I wasn't there.

27:57.160 --> 28:01.950
This is what happened when the Americans
brutally bombed Shimbashi station in Tokyo,

28:02.040 --> 28:05.999
which, although it was a railroad terminal,
was not a military objective,

28:06.080 --> 28:10.710
but was crowded with civilians
attempting to flee to a place of safety.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.070
This, at least, Excellency, is the truth.

28:27.160 --> 28:33.156
I'm a soldier of China. My father has
answered to his ancestors for your betrayal.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.318
Stand up, fellas, for a man.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.915
The court regrets this interruption,
and especially deplores its nature.

29:22.000 --> 29:25.117
The Chinese are a treacherous people.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.191
Try as we will to enlighten them,

29:27.280 --> 29:31.478
they remain barbarians who will strike down
even their own flesh and blood,

29:31.560 --> 29:34.028
if the price is high enough.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.715
I believe we can spare ourselves
further visual testimony.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.995
General Mitsubi.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.710
Can you tell the court
the base from which these prisoners came?

29:45.800 --> 29:50.191
Yes, Excellency.
As a result of our preliminary investigation,

29:50.280 --> 29:55.479
we have every reason to believe
that they came from an aircraft carrier...

29:55.560 --> 29:57.790
of the Hornet type.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.710
I trust Your Excellencies
will pardon my interruption.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.712
Proceed, Admiral Yamagichi.

30:06.880 --> 30:11.476
General Mitsubi, your brilliance
in matters of military investigation

30:11.560 --> 30:14.074
is famous throughout the empire.

30:14.520 --> 30:17.114
I rebuke myself
for calling to your attention

30:17.200 --> 30:22.752
certain matters which you must already
have investigated most exhaustively -

30:22.840 --> 30:26.116
certain findings of a naval board of inquiry.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.751
I am grateful
for Your Excellency's assistance.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.593
In a spirit of the most respectful cooperation,

30:34.680 --> 30:40.312
I should like to place these findings
at Your Excellency's disposal...

30:41.120 --> 30:42.155
in private.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.397
The prisoners will be removed.

30:44.480 --> 30:48.359
Court is adjourned
until tomorrow at the same hour.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.114
The emperor has charged this court

31:10.200 --> 31:15.593
with the responsibility of learning the exact
base from which this attack was launched.

31:15.680 --> 31:21.312
I will countenance no political bickering
between the navy and the army.

31:21.400 --> 31:24.551
You are convinced that
the planes came from a carrier?

31:24.640 --> 31:27.359
Yes, Excellency.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.908
And you, Admiral Yamagichi, you disagree?

31:30.000 --> 31:34.357
I would not so far humiliate
either the general or myself.

31:35.440 --> 31:39.035
I merely wish you to consider certain facts.

31:40.200 --> 31:42.839
If it is proved that I am in error,

31:42.920 --> 31:48.074
I shall feel that I have falsely accused
the Imperial Navy of negligence,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.628
and I shall apologise with my life.

32:03.240 --> 32:07.791
With Your Excellency's permission, I can
produce immediate proof of my contention.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.348
Proceed, General Mitsubi.

32:18.600 --> 32:21.194
- What is your name?
- Saburo Goto, Excellency.

32:21.280 --> 32:24.158
- You are a sailor in the Japanese navy?
- Yes.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.231
Where were you on April 18?

32:26.320 --> 32:29.232
<i>On my ship, the Ni-ju-ni-nichi Maru,
a converted trawler.</i>

32:29.320 --> 32:32.153
- Where was your ship?
- On patrol 800 miles at sea.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.549
- What happened?
- We were sunk by an enemy vessel.

32:34.640 --> 32:38.918
- At what time of day was this?
- Shortly after eight o'clock in the morning.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.791
I submit that the sinking of this man's ship
by a carrier at eight o'clock in the morning

32:44.880 --> 32:49.749
would time perfectly with the arrival
of the bombers over Tokyo at midday.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.273
You may go.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.635
One moment, please.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.235
You have been taught to identify
enemy vessels of various types?

32:57.320 --> 32:58.548
Yes, Excellency.

32:58.640 --> 33:02.394
Describe the type of enemy vessel
which sank you.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.438
- I cannot tell you, Excellency.
- Why not?

33:05.520 --> 33:08.478
I was below deck in the boiler room
when we were hit,

33:08.560 --> 33:10.790
and yet I was the only survivor.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.110
You did not yourself see the enemy ship?

33:13.200 --> 33:18.320
When I recovered consciousness,
I saw only the wreckage of our own ship.

33:18.400 --> 33:21.198
It was raining and the visibility was poor.

33:21.280 --> 33:27.628
Excellency, this man's vessel was patrolling
an area which the navy has heavily mined.

33:27.720 --> 33:32.748
It is not uncommon for a mine to break loose
and sink or damage one of our own vessels.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.638
I submit that such an accident
is far more probable

33:35.720 --> 33:37.631
than the presence of an enemy carrier

33:37.720 --> 33:43.317
in a zone which the Imperial Navy
regards as impregnable.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.675
That is all.

33:51.560 --> 33:56.031
I have technical information, Excellency,
which I consider conclusive proof

33:56.120 --> 34:01.114
that the American planes
could not have come from a carrier.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.795
The American planes which bombed Japan

34:08.880 --> 34:13.271
have been officially identified
as the type known as the B-25 bomber.

34:13.360 --> 34:19.117
It has a wingspread of 67 feet
and an overall length of 54.1875 feet.

34:20.239 --> 34:23.949
This is the largest type
of American aircraft carrier -

34:24.040 --> 34:25.871
the Hornet type.

34:25.960 --> 34:30.078
It has a flight deck
which is 809.6 feet in length.

34:30.159 --> 34:33.596
The presence on this flight deck of 16 B-25s

34:33.679 --> 34:37.195
would reduce the deck space
by more than two thirds,

34:37.280 --> 34:41.512
making a takeoff at sea
mathematically impossible.

34:41.600 --> 34:43.556
Can you refute these facts?

34:43.639 --> 34:45.870
I should like time to examine them.

34:45.960 --> 34:50.750
I expect this examination
to be completed without delay.

34:51.960 --> 34:57.557
Again, I wish to remind you of
the emperor's personal interest in this matter.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.790
You are excused, gentlemen.

35:21.920 --> 35:24.309
Shoe! Take off shoe!

35:49.800 --> 35:54.954
I've been thinking, and I can't figure out what
made him say we came from an aircraft...

36:06.240 --> 36:09.198
He was just trying
to get the navy's goat, you dope.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.472
It is I, Moy Ling.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.949
It's our Chinese friend.

36:44.720 --> 36:48.030
I propose we elect him
an honorary member of our squadron.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.190
<i>- All in favour say aye.
- Aye.</i>

36:50.280 --> 36:53.317
Do you hear that, Moy Ling?

36:53.400 --> 36:55.550
Yes, my captain.

37:00.040 --> 37:04.716
I wish to explain
why I did not act sooner than I did.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.634
It required much time
to decide to kill my own father.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.591
Goodbye, friend.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.669
- Bye, Captain.
- Bye.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.830
I'd have him on my team any time.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.877
- Captain Ross?
- Yes.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.758
<i>You come.</i>

38:08.520 --> 38:10.476
Well, boys, I'll see you again.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.869
Soon, I hope.

38:36.120 --> 38:38.429
You go in there.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.877
- Captain Ross?
- Yes, sir.

39:08.960 --> 39:13.112
At last. My name is Keppel.
Karl Keppel of the Swiss Red Cross.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.988
- Well, I'm sure mighty glad to see you, sir.
- And I to see you.

39:17.080 --> 39:20.516
Ever since I learned you were captured,
I have tried to reach you,

39:20.600 --> 39:23.319
but nobody would admit
knowing anything about you -

39:23.400 --> 39:25.994
where you were
or what had happened to you.

39:26.080 --> 39:31.757
I'd still be cooling my heels in somebody's
office if it hadn't been for General Mitsubi.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.479
Mr Keppel, may I see your credentials?

39:34.560 --> 39:38.872
We're charged with murder. Mitsubi
is the star witness for the prosecution.

39:38.960 --> 39:42.919
- Murder? You are on trial?
- In a civilian criminal court, Mr Keppel.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.516
They claim we bombed civilians and are not
entitled to be considered prisoners of war.

39:47.600 --> 39:53.596
I'll get word to Washington immediately.
They will take steps to stop this outrage.

39:55.040 --> 39:58.157
Forgive me for being suspicious.
You see the spot we're in.

39:58.240 --> 40:02.028
I do indeed, and I shall do
everything in my power to help you.

40:02.120 --> 40:04.793
I'll come again and report my progress.

40:04.880 --> 40:09.476
Meanwhile, Captain,
goodbye and good luck to you and your men.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.755
Thank you, sir.

40:14.200 --> 40:16.555
Could you spare me a moment, Mr Keppel?

40:16.640 --> 40:19.108
I am at your service, General.

40:26.800 --> 40:31.032
Captain Ross no doubt told you about
the charges against him and his men.

40:31.120 --> 40:33.270
Yes, sir. He did.

40:33.360 --> 40:39.071
Tell me, Mr Keppel, in your opinion, can
Washington force us to drop these charges?

40:39.160 --> 40:41.390
It most certainly can and will.

40:41.480 --> 40:47.350
There are over 100,000 Japanese nationals
in internment camps in the United States.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.590
Thank you very much, Mr Keppel.

40:49.680 --> 40:52.353
Your observations are most interesting.

40:52.440 --> 40:58.436
If there's anything further I can do for you,
don't hesitate to call upon me.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.555
Sit down, please.

41:11.520 --> 41:14.318
Ever been in California, Captain?

41:14.400 --> 41:16.038
Lots of times.

41:16.120 --> 41:17.917
Recently?

41:19.240 --> 41:22.118
You're a soldier and an officer.
You know as well as I do

41:22.200 --> 41:26.318
I can't give you any information
other than name, rank and serial number.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.073
I was only curious about Santa Barbara.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.118
I lived there for some time.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.111
A beautiful town.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.589
Worked on a fishing boat...

41:36.680 --> 41:40.389
and charted every inch of water
from San Diego to Seattle.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.393
- Those charts will be useful some day.
- Don't bet on it, General.

41:44.480 --> 41:47.278
Perhaps you do not believe
Japan will win the war.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.510
Me and 140 million others.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.909
You still doubt it.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.476
Look here, Captain.

41:55.560 --> 42:00.156
Singapore, Hong Kong, the Indies, Thailand.

42:00.240 --> 42:02.117
May I remind you, Captain,

42:02.200 --> 42:07.877
in five months we have changed from a
have-not nation to the largest have nation.

42:07.960 --> 42:13.990
We control 65 per cent of the world's tin,
85 per cent of copper, 90 per cent of rubber.

42:14.080 --> 42:18.710
In the conquered areas alone, we have 400
million workers developing these resources.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.756
We have a few resources too, General.

42:20.840 --> 42:24.799
The bombing of Japan
was somewhat resourceful, don't you think?

42:24.880 --> 42:27.952
A mere token raid, Captain.

42:28.040 --> 42:33.273
Our important buildings have been
constructed to withstand any catastrophe.

42:33.840 --> 42:38.277
That makes it tough on the little guys
who live in the paper houses, doesn't it?

42:38.360 --> 42:43.115
Don't depend upon a panic among
our people. They are conditioned to shock.

42:43.200 --> 42:47.273
Our earthquakes
have been valuable in that respect.

42:47.360 --> 42:52.354
No, Captain. Japan is united in this war
through emperor-worship and hate -

42:52.440 --> 42:55.830
hate for all foreigners, white or otherwise.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.471
The Japanese will win.

42:59.560 --> 43:02.597
He wears wood-fibre clothes,
cardboard shoes.

43:02.680 --> 43:06.150
He cheerfully eats one third of his usual diet.

43:06.240 --> 43:11.030
He works 14 hours a day, seven days a week.

43:11.120 --> 43:14.396
And our soldiers - ask your troops at Bataan.

43:14.480 --> 43:18.393
We do not leave any place that we want.
You must kill us.

43:18.480 --> 43:23.600
We will win this war because
we are willing to sacrifice 10 million lives.

43:23.680 --> 43:27.593
How many lives
is the white man willing to sacrifice?

43:28.320 --> 43:30.436
Your figures sound mighty impressive,

43:30.520 --> 43:34.513
and from all I've heard of your soldiers,
they fight like cornered rats.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.318
No offence, General.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.914
But I still can't answer your questions.

43:40.360 --> 43:45.957
Tell me, Captain Ross,
do you share Mr Keppel's opinion?

43:46.040 --> 43:50.272
Do you believe
your government can help you?

43:50.360 --> 43:52.794
That I don't know, but I do know this.

43:52.880 --> 43:56.873
If you do anything to us, the people
back home are not gonna forget it.

43:56.960 --> 44:01.556
Would it surprise you to learn
that I thoroughly agree with Mr Keppel?

44:01.640 --> 44:05.792
Washington will act
as soon as they receive the news.

44:05.880 --> 44:06.915
But...

44:07.000 --> 44:10.231
But will Washington receive the news?
Is that what you mean?

44:10.320 --> 44:13.790
That depends upon you and me.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.917
If you tell the truth
and admit you came from a carrier,

44:17.000 --> 44:21.994
I will permit Mr Keppel's message
to go through to Washington.

44:22.080 --> 44:26.596
Even if I trusted you, General,
I still wouldn't tell you.

44:26.680 --> 44:29.069
And I don't trust you.

44:34.160 --> 44:37.755
Very well. That is your decision.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.629
Captain Ross, sir.

44:51.000 --> 44:53.468
You see, Captain Ross,

44:53.560 --> 44:56.120
you are not my only prisoner.

44:56.200 --> 45:01.274
Must I remind you that
a chain is no stronger than its weakest link?

45:14.160 --> 45:17.948
Is there anything you wish to say
to your comrade before you go?

45:18.400 --> 45:23.076
- I have nothing to say.
- Return the prisoner to his cell.

45:25.440 --> 45:27.635
Sit down, please.

46:01.840 --> 46:07.710
- They took Skvoznik.
- Yes. They brought him to Mitsubi's office.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.949
What's going on?

46:09.040 --> 46:13.636
Mitsubi wants to know where
our bombers came from. I didn't tell him.

46:13.720 --> 46:19.397
And if Skvoznik doesn't tell him,
he's gonna keep after us one by one.

46:19.480 --> 46:23.189
Skvoznik won't tell him.
I know the guy. He'll die first.

46:23.280 --> 46:27.478
He's strong as an ox. He worked every
summer as an iron puddler with his father.

46:27.560 --> 46:31.155
- Boy, was he tough on a football field.
- Sure, he made all-American.

46:31.240 --> 46:34.038
Best game he ever played
was with three broken ribs.

46:34.120 --> 46:39.194
They won't get anything out of him.
He'll take all they've got.

46:48.120 --> 46:51.078
Do you suppose that was Skvoznik?

46:51.160 --> 46:52.957
I don't know.

46:53.040 --> 46:55.270
I don't know what to think.

46:55.360 --> 46:58.352
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

47:15.120 --> 47:17.554
You scared, kid?

47:17.640 --> 47:20.279
I wonder if we can take it.

47:20.360 --> 47:22.749
All the way, I mean.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.115
I wonder.

47:26.200 --> 47:30.478
It's the fear of being afraid
that frightens me more than anything else.

47:30.560 --> 47:35.111
Just remember what the old man told you.
Fear has nothing to do with cowardice.

47:35.200 --> 47:39.955
A fellow is only yellow
when he lets his fear make him quit.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.759
I had it bad when we took off,
my hands were shaking,

47:42.840 --> 47:46.230
my heart was pounding so loud
I thought everybody could hear it.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.880
If I'd have been all alone, nobody around,

47:48.960 --> 47:52.111
I don't know whether or not
I could have made it.

47:52.200 --> 47:56.079
And now I think
we'd better change the subject.

49:10.080 --> 49:12.275
Pilot to navigator.

49:12.480 --> 49:14.596
Pilot to navigator.

49:17.080 --> 49:18.957
Roger.

49:21.360 --> 49:25.552
Roger.

49:25.640 --> 49:29.189
<i>Army pilots, man your planes.
Army pilots, man your planes.</i>

49:29.280 --> 49:32.829
<i>Take off now? Why?
We're not due to take off for 36 hours yet.</i>

49:32.920 --> 49:37.436
<i>We have to. The trawler saw us. She
may have radioed Tokyo before we hit her.</i>

49:37.520 --> 49:41.798
<i>- So long. See you in Chongqing.
- Thanks for the ride, sailor.</i>

49:41.880 --> 49:46.556
<i>Attention, men. If any of you
are forced down, destroy your ship at once.</i>

49:46.640 --> 49:50.349
<i>We don't want to take any chance
on the Japs tracing you to this carrier.</i>

49:50.440 --> 49:53.034
<i>Whatever the cost, protect the Hornet.</i>

49:53.120 --> 49:59.798
<i>Protect the Hornet. Protect
the Hornet. Protect the Hornet.</i>

49:59.880 --> 50:06.797
<i>Must I remind you, Captain, that
a chain is no stronger than its weakest link?</i>

50:06.880 --> 50:08.791
<i>Weakest link...</i>

50:09.000 --> 50:12.231
<i>Weakest link...</i>

50:52.160 --> 50:54.594
My name is Keppel, of the Swiss Red Cross.

50:54.680 --> 50:57.638
- I would like to see Mr Oraki.
- Concerning what, please?

50:57.720 --> 51:02.032
He wouldn't approve this message. I have
revised it according to his suggestions.

51:02.120 --> 51:05.476
Thank you. I will call it to his attention.
Return tomorrow.

51:05.560 --> 51:09.109
- But this message must be sent now.
- So sorry. It will take time.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.158
Time? Time? That's one thing I cannot spare.

51:12.240 --> 51:16.711
If you wish to file a complaint,
please consult Bureau of Enlightenment.

51:16.800 --> 51:19.268
Thank you. I shall.

51:45.320 --> 51:47.959
The judges will exercise their powers

51:48.040 --> 51:50.952
in accordance with the law,
and by authority of the emperor.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.838
Up, stand. Everybody! Up, stand!

52:06.880 --> 52:10.759
<i>Bring in the defendants.</i>

52:29.320 --> 52:33.598
- Today there are only seven.
- Perhaps one is indisposed.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.148
<i>You may be seated.</i>

52:40.320 --> 52:44.711
With Your Excellency's permission,
I should like to question one of the prisoners.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.438
Proceed.

52:46.520 --> 52:48.670
Sergeant Jan Skvoznik.

52:49.240 --> 52:53.233
I wish to apologise to the court
for the absence of this defendant.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.675
He became ill during the night.

52:55.760 --> 52:58.718
I request that he be excused
from further testimony.

52:58.800 --> 53:03.510
I am deeply touched
by Mr Sakai's concern for his client.

53:03.600 --> 53:09.835
I have only a few questions, which I am sure
will not inconvenience this poor American.

53:09.920 --> 53:13.310
I have taken the liberty
of having him brought here.

53:13.400 --> 53:16.597
This court has no patience with malingering.

53:16.680 --> 53:19.274
You may question the witness.

53:56.240 --> 54:01.314
- State your name.
- Name... Name...

54:01.400 --> 54:04.870
Your name is Jan Skvoznik.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.997
Skvoznik. Skvoznik.

54:08.080 --> 54:10.469
Stop it! Stop it, you fiends!

54:10.560 --> 54:16.078
Look at him - sick. He's never been sick
a day in his life, you dirty, crawling rat.

54:16.160 --> 54:18.594
If you are newspapermen,
how can you sit there?

54:18.680 --> 54:24.277
Why don't you scream the shame of this
from every headline, every radio? If you are...

54:24.360 --> 54:27.955
Get your slimy hands off of him, you dirty...

54:51.440 --> 54:54.876
I instruct the correspondents
to ignore this fanatical outburst.

54:54.960 --> 54:59.112
It was staged with the obvious purpose
of enlisting your sympathy.

54:59.200 --> 55:03.239
General Mitsubi, proceed with the testimony.

55:06.080 --> 55:08.071
Sit down.

55:09.680 --> 55:13.593
<i>Your name is Jan Skvoznik.</i>

55:35.200 --> 55:37.668
- Corregidor has fallen.
- Corregidor has fallen.

55:37.760 --> 55:42.276
The Philippines belong to us!
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

56:17.680 --> 56:21.389
What do you think
of your illustrious General MacArthur now?

56:21.480 --> 56:23.835
He escaped capture by running away.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.151
Don't be too disappointed, General.
You'll meet him again.

56:27.240 --> 56:31.711
- You approve of his action?
- Wholeheartedly. It was realistic.

56:31.800 --> 56:37.955
I think so too. It is a wise man who knows
where courage ends and stupidity begins.

56:38.040 --> 56:42.079
General MacArthur abandoned Corregidor
when he saw defence was useless.

56:42.160 --> 56:43.832
That is clever.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.878
You insist on protecting the carrier
from which you came,

56:46.960 --> 56:49.235
when it no longer needs your protection.

56:49.320 --> 56:50.912
That is stupid.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.878
General MacArthur had his orders.
We have ours.

56:53.960 --> 56:58.112
I'm sure he found his orders
as difficult to obey as we find ours.

57:03.040 --> 57:07.716
As you wish. Remove the prisoners.

57:31.840 --> 57:34.638
Twice within an hour
I narrowly escaped with my life.

57:34.720 --> 57:37.553
The Japanese treat me as if I am an enemy.

57:37.640 --> 57:42.191
Portugal and Russia are neutral enemies.
England and America, belligerent enemies,

57:42.280 --> 57:46.751
Germany and her satellites are friendly
enemies. They draw a very fine distinction.

57:46.840 --> 57:49.718
Good afternoon, comrades.

57:50.800 --> 57:53.030
Why aren't you celebrating the victory?

57:53.120 --> 57:55.998
You both know Mr Keppel
of the Swiss Red Cross.

57:56.080 --> 57:59.436
How are you, Mr Keppel?
Why aren't you celebrating the victory?

57:59.520 --> 58:03.877
I have turned in my credentials.
I have resigned my position.

58:03.960 --> 58:06.554
I am thoroughly ashamed.

58:09.640 --> 58:15.158
- Won't you gentlemen join us?
- Thank you. Thank you.

58:15.240 --> 58:19.028
Mr Keppel has a favour to ask.
I will let him tell his own story.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.634
He needs help desperately.

58:21.720 --> 58:26.111
The thing is, I'm trying
to get a message to Washington.

58:49.880 --> 58:52.713
- What do you think?
- He's the same.

58:52.800 --> 58:54.631
He'll always be the same, I guess.

58:54.720 --> 58:57.234
What about Vincent? What about Canelli?

58:57.320 --> 59:01.950
<i>- Take it easy, Stoner.
- Yes, but it's night and they're not back yet.</i>

59:02.640 --> 59:06.553
Whatever's happened to them,
at least we know they haven't talked.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.709
You and you, take him in.

59:35.640 --> 59:38.837
What did you do to him? Just let me out...

59:53.200 --> 59:57.398
<i>He's alive. That's about all.</i>

01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:24.078
<i>- What did they do to you?
- What you see.</i>

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:32.359
I intended to continue studying art
if I came through this war.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:36.592
The way things look,
I guess I'll have to change my plans.

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.958
I don't mind so much,
but it's sure gonna be tough on my folks.

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.237
From the first moment
I drew a three-legged cow with a crayon,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.835
my father dreamed of a second Michelangelo.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:55.234
Together with my mother, he saved every
penny for years to send me to Italy to study.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:58.073
When the day came for me to go,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.357
Italy was in the war and on the wrong side.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.034
I couldn't go and I couldn't stay.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.238
I'd said goodbye to too many people.
You know how it is.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.629
So I went to New York.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.269
"There are fine schools there,"
I told my parents.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:19.992
Instead I enlisted. I wanted to fight
the thing that had spoiled my father's dream.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.393
As far as he knows, I'm still in New York
painting beautiful pictures.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.471
I'm glad.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.757
- How's Vincent?
- He's still out.

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.310
- You know what he said before passing out?
- Hold it, Angelo.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.437
We don't know which one of us will be next,

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.715
or how soon.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:56.117
What's that?

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.668
- What's what?
- That music.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:11.036
- I don't hear anything.
- That's funny. I can hear it, plain as anything.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.513
That was my old man's favourite.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.237
"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways."

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.039
- What?
- Oh.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:50.430
That's what Anne had inscribed
on the wristwatch she gave me.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.317
Oh.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.560
"How do I love thee?"

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.756
"Let me count the ways."

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.513
"I love thee to the depth
and breadth and height

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:09.639
My soul can reach,
when feeling out of sight

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.669
For the ends of being and ideal grace."

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:18.514
<i>"I love thee to the level
of every day's most quiet need,</i>

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:20.397
<i>by sun and candle-light."</i>

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.516
<i>- Anne.
- Hello, Martin.</i>

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.033
<i>Hello.</i>

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:27.351
<i>"I love thee freely,
as men strive for right."</i>

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:30.910
<i>"I love thee purely, as they turn from praise."</i>

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.754
<i>"I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs,</i>

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.593
<i>and with my childhood's faith."</i>

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:41.992
<i>"I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints."</i>

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:47.996
<i>"I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life;</i>

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:54.758
<i>and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death."</i>

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.752
"...and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death."

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.673
You too, Clint?

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.513
I guess I was pretty far away.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.070
Personally, I'll settle for a nice, juicy steak.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.436
But I got the kind of thoughts
that don't cooperate.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.432
The kind that insist on
sticking to the trouble at hand.

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.875
The kind that keep saying:

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.077
"Who do you think
you're kidding, Greenbaum?"

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.630
My thoughts played a trick on me too.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:30.632
One time when I was a little boy, I got lost.

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:34.190
I stopped a policeman
and asked him how to find my home.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:37.431
When I told him who I was,
he offered to take me there.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.753
"Please don't," I said. "Just tell me
where I live. I want to find it myself."

01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:47.834
He laughed and said he understood,
and told me how to find my home.

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.275
I asked him his name.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.275
"The boys down at the station house
call me Joe," he said.

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.749
Until I joined the army,

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.358
he was the only person I ever knew
who let me do anything for myself.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.830
It was Joe my thoughts took me to just now.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.996
I don't know why.

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.832
Not your girl,

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.592
not your old man,

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:17.716
not your mama.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.995
A cop named Joe.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.391
Rich people.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.238
Sergeant Clinton, you come.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.990
Howard!

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.798
Don't worry, Greenie.

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.555
It's the second time in my life
I've had a chance to find my own way home.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.029
I think I can make it.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.115
- Not a scratch!
- Never even touched you. Nice score.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.475
All our worry for nothing.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.030
- What's the idea of being AWOL?
- Just in time for breakfast.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.190
What did you do? Scare Mitsubi?

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.953
What did he have to say to you?

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.954
Wait a minute. I know
what you're thinking, but it's not true.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.157
Go on. Tell 'em it's not true.
Tell 'em you didn't talk.

01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.038
Say something, Howard. Talk! Talk!

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:44.279
You can talk, can't you?

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.472
- They did torture him.
- They must have choked him.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.233
Is that it? Is that what they did?

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.351
Please try.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.078
It's tea, Clint. It'll be good for you.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.791
Stoner.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.477
Yes, sir.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:40.917
I was just figuring up. Today is my birthday.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.357
- Happy birthday, Captain.
- Happy birthday, Captain.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.632
Aren't you going to drink with me, Stoner?

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:07.151
In a cup of General Somebody's stinkingly
bitter tea... I drink your very good health, sir.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.958
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.070
How old are you today, sir?

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:16.948
I'm 30. I'm getting to be an old man.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.909
30.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.390
"HAS there any old fellow
got mixed with the boys?"

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.031
"If there has, throw him out,
without making a noise."

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.193
Carry on, Stoner.
You're making me feel younger.

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.158
I don't know whether I remember it.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:50.914
"Hang the Catalogue's cheat
and the Almanac's spite!"

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.911
"Old Time is a liar!"

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.036
"We're twenty to-night!"

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.317
"We're twenty! We're twenty!"

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.868
"Who says we are more?"

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.080
"He's tipsy... young jackanapes!...
show him the door!"

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.357
"We've a trick, we young fellows,
you may have been told,

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.228
Of talking (in public) as if we were old:

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.313
That boy we call "Doctor,"
this we call "Judge;"

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.476
It's a neat little fiction...
of course it's all fudge."

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.873
"Yes, we're boys,
- always playing with sword or with pen...

01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:33.193
And I sometimes have asked...
Shall we ever be men?"

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:37.239
"Shall we always be youthful,
and laughing, and gay,

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:41.598
Till the last dear companion
drops smiling away?"

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.549
"Then here's to our boyhood,
its gold and its gray!"

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.633
"The stars of its winter, the dews of its May!"

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.391
Lieutenant Bayforth.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.549
"When we have done
with our life-lasting toys,

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.668
Dear Father,
take care of thy children, THE BOYS!"

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.750
- Harvey! Harvey!
- What is it?

01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:12.955
It's Clinton.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:17.431
He says if they do to Bayforth what they did
to him and the others, he's gonna talk.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.352
If he feels he must talk, only God
and his own conscience should stop him.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.554
Mitsubi.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.672
<i>Lieutenant Bayforth...</i>

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.957
<i>Sergeant Clinton...</i>

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.233
Lieutenant Kenneth Bayforth.

01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:15.273
Are you aware, Lieutenant Bayforth,
of the information desired from you?

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:20.718
- Yes, I am.
- Are you willing to reveal this information?

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.116
No, I'm not.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.478
Thank you, Lieutenant Bayforth.
You may step down.

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:53.555
Sergeant Howard Clinton, take the stand.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.713
Sergeant Clinton,
do you have a statement to make?

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:09.590
I wish to apologise to the court
for this defendant's inability to answer.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.070
He became ill during the night
and suffered the loss of his voice.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:18.314
In that case, we will provide the prisoner
with other means of communication.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.549
Write your statement.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.557
The defendant points out
that since he is unable to talk,

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:07.555
he has appointed
a brother officer to speak for him.

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:10.871
- Proceed.
- Lieutenant Greenbaum, take the stand.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.349
You may step down.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:39.314
Read to the court the information
Sergeant Clinton wishes to reveal.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:44.551
Gladly.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.111
Thanks to your Dictaphone, you heard
me say that if Bayforth was tortured,

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.919
Sergeant Clinton would speak.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:58.394
Well, there sits Lieutenant Bayforth,
and Sergeant Clinton keeps his word.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.916
He speaks gratefully
of the pain you inflicted upon him,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.993
pain which cleared the mist from his eyes
and showed, with the sharpness of torture,

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.913
exactly why you must know
where our bombers came from.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.039
He speaks of the strength with which
you must patrol the Russian frontier,

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.395
if that is where we came from.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:19.189
He speaks of the forces with which
you guard against attack from China,

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.998
in case we came from there.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:24.629
He speaks of your naval power
forced onto the defensive,

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:28.269
because we might have come from a carrier.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.510
He speaks of eight soldiers,

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.798
unknown, imprisoned and without hope.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:40.193
Eight insignificant men that have your whole
army, navy and air force tied up in a knot.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.635
These are the things of which he speaks,

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:47.236
in this moment of pain and agony and pride.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.153
And now I'll speak for myself.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:55.835
On the day you give Skvoznik
back his mind and Vincent his senses,

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.754
on the day you restore the use
of Canelli's arms and Bayforth's hands,

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.195
on the day you give Clinton back his voice,

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.192
on that day,
I'll tell you what you want to know,

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.033
and not one second sooner.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:13.356
Order! Order!

01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.076
General Mitsubi,
have you any further evidence?

01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.151
Yes, Excellency.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:28.791
Step down.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.072
- Proceed, General Mitsubi.
- Thank you, Excellency.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:50.079
I have been authorised by a power so high
I dare not mention his honourable name

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.948
to request the court
to dismiss the charges against you.

01:23:54.040 --> 01:24:00.070
After all, you are fighting for your country -
a situation every Japanese can understand.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:04.278
When you bombed schools and hospitals,
you were only acting under orders.

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.874
It is your commanding officers
who are guilty.

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.157
It is they who should be on trial.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.073
I therefore request the court
that the trial be ended,

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.709
and the charges
against these prisoners be dismissed.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:22.670
The court is disposed
to show every leniency toward these flyers...

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.154
provided that they inform this court
of the identities of their commanding officers,

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.391
so that they may be punished
when Japan has won the war,

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.199
and that they further inform this court

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:39.477
as to the exact location
of the base from which they came,

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.710
so that immediate steps may be taken

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:45.998
to prevent a recurrence
of the monstrous murder of civilians.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.636
What happens to us
if the charges against us are dismissed?

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:55.111
If you accept, you will be
removed to a military prison camp,

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.354
and shown the consideration to which
all legitimate prisoners of war are entitled.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.192
And if we refuse to accept?

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.875
You will be found guilty as charged
and you will be executed.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:11.034
I beg of you, do not answer hastily.
Realise what this means to you.

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.192
We have thousands
of British and American prisoners of war,

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:19.434
and although Japan never signed
the Geneva Treaty, we respect its provisions.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.594
You will live in a camp with fellow soldiers.
You will be well-fed and well-clothed.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.194
You will be contacted by the Red Cross.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.078
You will be able to send letters
to your loved ones.

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:35.393
Think, Captain Ross,
Lieutenant Bayforth, you other men,

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.471
we are offering you your lives.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.199
You have only to accept.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.750
How do we know you'll do what you say?
You can promise us anything.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:49.356
The members of the international press
are present. They are your witnesses.

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:52.796
The imperial court's decision
will be handed down in writing,

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:57.670
and certified copies
deposited with the Swiss legation.

01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:17.075
After what my men have been through,
that's a tempting offer,

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.358
and we know that the Swiss can be trusted,
but I'd like some time.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.070
I request that the defendants be granted
a few minutes to discuss their decision.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.312
<i>The request is granted.
Remove the prisoners to my chambers.</i>

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.439
Well, men, for one moment
this undemocratic hole

01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:57.592
has given us
the democratic privilege of majority rule.

01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:01.719
It seems we're a jury which must decide
whether its own members live or die.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.952
I suggest we discuss it thoroughly
before taking a vote.

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:10.192
A man who is half-dead is half-decided.
I am not qualified to vote.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:12.396
Canelli is right.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.029
The choice belongs to those of you
who have something to live for.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:20.193
No. You've been tortured,
you've given your blood, you faced death,

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:21.918
and you remained silent.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.869
As long as I too faced only death,
I believed that my courage could equal yours.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:29.030
But now I'm not facing death.

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:30.951
I'm facing life.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.797
I feel that only those who have known torture
can weigh its value, and are entitled to vote.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:39.872
- The captain speaks for me.
- And for me.

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.999
"Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord."

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:54.633
- "He is trampling out the vintage..."
- "...where the grapes of wrath are stored."

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.553
- "He's loosed the fateful..."
- "...lightning..."

01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:00.712
<i>"...of his terrible, swift sword."</i>

01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:03.439
"His truth..."

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.953
<i>"...is marching..."</i>

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.429
"His truth is marching on."

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.875
"Glo... Glory..."

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:15.272
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:21.592
- Glory...
- Glory, hallelujah

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.719
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:30.078
His truth is marching on

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:34.559
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:39.231
Glory, glory, hallelujah

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.914
Glory, glory...

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.516
I guess it needed a wisdom
much more profound than ours.

01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:08.716
It's not majority rule.

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:12.076
It's one for all and all for one.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:16.836
Each of us must bear on his own conscience
the responsibility for Vincent...

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:18.911
and Skvoznik.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:24.715
This will be a secret ballot. Here. Take these.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:39.037
Of course. This is how we'll do it.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:43.159
The man who thinks we ought to talk
will drop his wings in here - broken.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.233
The man who wants to remain silent
will drop in his wings - unbroken.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.711
If there is one pair of broken wings in this
vase, we'll tell them what they want to know.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.394
<i>- Is that agreed?
- Agreed.</i>

01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:59.474
This way, none of us will ever know
which one decided to talk.

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:06.435
Time is up.

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.191
We're ready.

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:41.354
- Have you reached a decision?
- It's in here.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.869
If you find one pair of broken wings
in this vase, we'll speak.

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:50.269
That's our decision.

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.555
Thanks, fellas.

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:41.194
Captain Ross, is this your final word?

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:43.919
No, Excellency.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:49.835
It's true we Americans don't know very much
about you Japanese, and never did.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.753
And now I realise
you know even less about us.

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.513
You can kill us, all of us, or part of us,

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:59.195
but if you think that will put fear
into the United States of America

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:03.398
and stop them from sending other flyers
to bomb you, you're wrong, dead wrong.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.233
They'll come by night and by day,
thousands of them.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:11.599
They'll blacken your skies and burn
your cities and make you beg for mercy.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:16.390
This is your war. You wanted it. You asked for
it. You started it. Now you're going to get it.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:21.759
And it won't be finished until your dirty
little empire is wiped off the face of the earth.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.000
The prisoners will stand.

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.279
The defendants are found guilty of the crime
of murder set forth in the indictment.

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:02.956
They will be removed from the court and
given into the custody of the military prison

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:08.717
until such time as the sentence of death
is executed upon their bodies.

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.594
<i>Off we go into the wild blue yonder</i>

01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:00.911
<i>Climbing high into the sun</i>

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:05.514
<i>Here they come,
zooming to meet our thunder</i>

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.272
<i>At 'em, boys</i>

01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:09.510
<i>Give her the gun</i>

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:13.752
<i>Down we dive,
spouting our flames from under</i>

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.912
<i>Off with one terrible roar</i>

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.879
<i>We live in fame or go down in flame</i>

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:24.794
<i>But nothing can stop the Army Air Corps</i>

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.714
<i>We live in fame or go down in flame</i>

01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.234
<i>But nothing can stop</i>

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:40.791
<i>The Army Air Corps</i>

01:35:41.305 --> 01:35:47.940
