WEBVTT

00:05.266 --> 00:07.137
- Good?
- Yeah, I think so.

00:07.181 --> 00:10.184
Mm.
You still coming tonight?

00:10.227 --> 00:12.360
- Yeah, I gotta see
this spare room.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.014
So listen, I think
I'm gonna go for, like,

00:14.057 --> 00:15.537
a real glacial move-in.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.495
- Sure. You know, if some
of your stuff doesn't make it

00:17.539 --> 00:19.497
over to my place, like,
say your collection

00:19.541 --> 00:21.673
of stolen beer steins,
totally fine.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.023
- Oh, I see what's up.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.286
- Totally fine.
- Message received.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.810
See, look at us communicating.

00:27.853 --> 00:30.465
Working things out.
Modern roommate parenting

00:30.508 --> 00:33.120
at its finest.
They said it couldn't be done.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.209
- Is "they" your dad?

00:35.252 --> 00:37.863
- Yes.
- I think it'll be good.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.083
You'll be there when
the baby comes, it's good.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.564
- Yeah, okay.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.045
I'll see you later.
- Okay.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.568
- Good-bye,
little rice grain baby.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.309
- It's the size
of a navel orange now.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.267
- Yeah, well,
I'm not gonna say that.

00:50.311 --> 00:52.617
- Get outta here.
- Have a good day, you two.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.663
- Bye.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.367
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hi, yes, um...

01:03.411 --> 01:05.195
I was in a car accident.
Everyone's okay,

01:05.239 --> 01:07.241
but the car's
blocking traffic.

01:09.895 --> 01:12.463
- 911, what's your emergency?

01:12.507 --> 01:15.901
911, what's your emergency?
Okay, ma'am.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.381
We're still gonna get
the fire department out

01:17.425 --> 01:18.643
to check on that alarm,
all right?

01:18.687 --> 01:20.123
So just sit tight.

01:20.167 --> 01:24.301
911, what's your emergency?

01:24.345 --> 01:26.521
- Hello?
911, can you hear me?

01:28.610 --> 01:31.569
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Help me.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.050
- Okay, ma'am, where are you?

01:34.094 --> 01:35.530
Can you tell me
what's going on?

01:35.573 --> 01:37.967
- Please help.
- Yes, I'm here to help you.

01:38.010 --> 01:40.230
Can you tell me
what's happening?

01:41.797 --> 01:43.103
- Ma'am, is someone
there with you?

01:43.146 --> 01:44.626
Are you unable to speak?

01:45.931 --> 01:47.803
Okay, it's okay,
I'm gonna track your address

01:47.846 --> 01:49.587
right now and send you
some help, all right?

01:49.631 --> 01:51.241
Don't talk
if you're not able to.

01:51.285 --> 01:53.765
I am here with you,
I'm not going anywhere.

01:55.289 --> 01:56.333
I've got officers
coming your way.

01:56.377 --> 01:57.595
Just hang on, help is coming.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.032
Just hang on,
I'm here with you.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.606
- Hello?

02:08.650 --> 02:11.000
Hello?

02:11.043 --> 02:12.958
No, no, no, no, no.

02:13.002 --> 02:15.222
Come on, come on, come on.

02:17.093 --> 02:21.663
Come on.

02:36.025 --> 02:39.115
911, what's your emergency?

02:39.159 --> 02:41.422
Okay, ma'am,
what's your location?

02:53.347 --> 02:55.653
"19-Paul, no police service."

03:02.051 --> 03:04.488
- Back already?
All your old buddies are gone.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.924
No action to siphon.
- Okay.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.926
I'm actually here to see
two of your officers.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.842
Um, O'Malley and Jeffries.

03:16.587 --> 03:19.590
Jeffries, O'Malley,
this is Officer Burgess.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.331
- Hey.
- With Intelligence?

03:21.375 --> 03:23.028
- Yeah, I'm on light duty
at the moment.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.856
Call-taker at OEMC.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.381
I actually saw that you guys
responded to a 911 call

03:27.424 --> 03:30.340
I answered,
322 South Aberdeen, West Loop.

03:30.384 --> 03:31.863
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

03:31.907 --> 03:34.344
Okay, I was just wondering,
why 19-Paul?

03:34.388 --> 03:36.303
- We talked to the husband
and wife who live there.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.653
Wife said it was
an accidental 911 call.

03:38.696 --> 03:41.612
Nothing to report.
- She said it was accidental?

03:41.656 --> 03:44.615
Okay, um, did you suspect
domestic violence, or--

03:44.659 --> 03:46.617
- No, ma'am, no signs of abuse.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.228
- Did you interview them
separately, or--

03:48.271 --> 03:50.665
- Hey, what is this?
- I'm sorry.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.188
I'm not checking up on you,
I just--

03:52.232 --> 03:53.755
- Isn't that exactly
what you're doing?

03:53.798 --> 03:56.410
Implying we just
blew off our job?

03:57.976 --> 04:00.414
- I apologize,
it's really not my intention.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.894
- Yeah.
Look, I get it.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.201
You're pulling light duty
'cause you're pregnant, right?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.943
Mothering hormones
plus boredom.

04:07.986 --> 04:10.511
I'd start seeing victims
everywhere too.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.688
There was nothing there.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.385
Husband and wife seemed happy,

04:15.429 --> 04:17.344
uh, no signs of anything wrong.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.955
We did our jobs, then we left.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.696
That's it.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.966
- Oh, no. Uh-uh.
Wouldn't do that.

04:31.009 --> 04:34.578
You're light duty.
You can't be doing follow-ups.

04:34.622 --> 04:37.320
- Then I take it
you're coming with me?

05:05.522 --> 05:08.569
- Okay, the condo
the 911 call came from is 3B,

05:08.612 --> 05:10.962
owned by George Weller
and Ann Weller.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.616
Are you coming?

05:14.879 --> 05:18.274
He's got no priors on either,
and no kids.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.495
George Weller? Chicago PD.

05:23.366 --> 05:27.152
George Weller, Chicago PD.

05:27.196 --> 05:30.460
Okay.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.854
That works too.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.206
- Blood.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.690
- Crossing.

05:52.221 --> 05:55.920
More blood.
Chicago PD!

06:11.893 --> 06:14.678
- I'm all clear here.
- Yeah, me too.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.463
Got signs of sex and violence
in the master.

06:16.506 --> 06:17.725
There's blood, there's urine.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.988
- Well, something
happened here.

06:20.031 --> 06:22.120
2102 Squad.
- Go, 2102.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.384
- Roll a couple units
and the mobile lab

06:24.427 --> 06:25.907
to 322 South Aberdeen.

06:25.950 --> 06:27.691
Hold me down
securing a crime scene.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.214
- Hello?
- 10-4.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.216
- Is everything okay?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.696
That couple fights
all the time.

06:32.740 --> 06:34.524
- Okay, have you seen them
this morning?

06:34.568 --> 06:38.180
- No, I haven't.
I've been inside.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.968
What is up with this elevator?

06:50.888 --> 06:53.238
- Do you hear?
- Yeah.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.993
Uh-uh.

07:25.967 --> 07:28.709
- So what do we got?
- What we got is no idea.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.058
- I got the call at dispatch.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.451
Woman calling
from inside the condo,

07:31.494 --> 07:32.452
asking for help.

07:32.495 --> 07:33.888
Patrol responded,

07:33.931 --> 07:35.106
interviewed the husband
and wife.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.368
We followed up,

07:36.412 --> 07:37.979
We found the husband
dead downstairs.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.676
- And all this happened between
the hours of your initial

07:39.720 --> 07:41.025
and the follow-up?
- Yeah, patrol saw no signs

07:41.069 --> 07:42.636
of disturbance.
- Door was unlocked

07:42.679 --> 07:44.681
when we got here,
signs of a struggle inside.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.248
Lots of blood trail.
- Oh, yeah.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.293
Someone took a heavy beating
in that master bathroom.

07:48.337 --> 07:49.512
- Husband?

07:49.556 --> 07:51.340
- I don't know.
I think the wife.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.776
The landline was
in the bathroom.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.212
I'm thinking she took
a beating, called me,

07:54.256 --> 07:56.519
then killed the husband,
but it's miles away

07:56.563 --> 07:57.955
from confirmation.
- There's no cameras

07:57.999 --> 07:59.957
in the building,
and no witnesses so far.

08:00.001 --> 08:02.090
- All right, let's start with
trying to locate the wife, huh?

08:02.133 --> 08:03.744
- You got it.

08:06.442 --> 08:08.183
- There are our guys.

08:09.532 --> 08:11.534
- Come on.
Hey.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.405
- Sarge, this makes no sense.
- Okay.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.972
- We were here a few hours ago.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.279
If something had felt wrong,
we wouldn't have left.

08:17.322 --> 08:20.325
- Listen, you can't always
see these things coming.

08:20.369 --> 08:23.067
What I wanna know is, did you
guys go inside the apartment?

08:23.111 --> 08:25.505
- No, we spoke with Mr.
and Mrs. Weller at the door.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.332
- Huh.
- They were happy, laughing.

08:27.376 --> 08:29.334
I mean, there were zero reasons
to go inside.

08:29.378 --> 08:32.903
- Did you see anyone around
when you entered the building?

08:32.947 --> 08:36.167
- Is that--
can I see that file?

08:36.211 --> 08:37.517
- Yeah.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.042
- This isn't--
- What's going on?

08:41.085 --> 08:43.218
- This isn't the woman
we spoke to.

08:43.261 --> 08:45.350
- That's Ann Weller's
current DMV photo.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.569
- The woman we spoke to
was younger.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.831
She was a brunette.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.659
She said her name
was Ann Weller,

08:49.703 --> 08:51.008
that she was his wife.

08:51.052 --> 08:54.359
I mean, we had no reason
to question that.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.057
Should we get
our FOP lawyers here?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.276
- Give me a break.
- If that's your first question

08:58.320 --> 09:00.801
right now, yeah,
I'd probably give them a call.

09:05.719 --> 09:09.026
So what made you do
the initial follow-up?

09:09.070 --> 09:11.638
- I don't know,
just a feeling, I guess.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.599
I heard it in her voice.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.296
- Good.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.909
- So if they didn't talk
to Ann Weller,

09:21.952 --> 09:24.128
who did they talk to?

09:24.172 --> 09:25.521
- Hey.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.610
- Well, you caught a weird one.

09:27.654 --> 09:30.352
George Weller here died
where he lies.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.615
Looks like a fight happened
in the elevator.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.530
Got blood splatter,
signs of a struggle,

09:34.574 --> 09:35.749
self-defense wounds,

09:35.792 --> 09:38.099
multiple lacerations
in the stomach.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.710
Killer rode down with him,
I'm thinking.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.625
- So can anyone access
this garage?

09:42.669 --> 09:43.713
- No, you need a remote.

09:43.757 --> 09:44.888
George didn't have his,

09:44.932 --> 09:46.498
we checked his car
and his crib.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.978
Pockets are empty,
no cell, no wallet.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.719
- We think
the killer robbed him.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.765
- Jay has Ann Weller right now.

09:51.808 --> 09:52.940
He's taking her
to the district.

09:52.983 --> 09:54.332
She's been at work all day.

09:54.376 --> 09:55.420
- Good, keep working the scene.

09:55.464 --> 09:58.423
Pull any forensics you can.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.208
- Sarge?
- Yeah?

10:00.251 --> 10:01.905
- It okay if I work
the case with you?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.428
I'll ride the desk
the whole time.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.127
- Ah, your instincts caught it,
you should work it.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.044
- I don't understand.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.916
My husband,
he was supposed to be at work.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.439
- I know this is hard,

10:14.483 --> 10:15.658
but it's important
that we ask you

10:15.702 --> 10:17.878
these questions right away.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.489
A woman called 911
from your condo.

10:20.532 --> 10:23.623
When patrol showed up,
the woman was with George,

10:23.666 --> 10:25.625
and she claimed to be you.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.324
Was your husband
having an affair?

10:31.021 --> 10:35.678
- My husband...
We've had issues.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.115
He has issues.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.771
If there was a woman
there with him,

10:41.815 --> 10:44.905
it's possible she was hired.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.821
My husband likes prostitutes.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.088
- So if she is a prostitute,
the question is,

10:54.131 --> 10:57.700
why call 911 and then lie
about it when patrol shows up?

10:57.744 --> 10:59.310
- Yeah, I think we have
an answer to that.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.269
George's cell phone wasn't
recovered at the scene,

11:01.312 --> 11:03.010
it's shut off now,
but we gained access

11:03.053 --> 11:04.315
to his iCloud account.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.230
- Patrol confirmed for us
that this is

11:06.274 --> 11:07.667
the actual lady
who they talked to

11:07.710 --> 11:09.233
at the condo.
- Time stamp?

11:09.277 --> 11:12.410
- These photos were taken eight
minutes before the 911 call.

11:12.454 --> 11:13.673
Followed by these.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.848
A second unidentified woman

11:14.891 --> 11:17.677
in the condo, same time frame.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.245
- She can't be more than 16.
She's the one who called 911.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.507
She's gotta be.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.510
Who is she?

11:25.554 --> 11:27.512
- Her photo doesn't match
in any of our systems.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.036
Not CHRIS, not Vice...

11:29.079 --> 11:30.951
- Missing persons?
- No, no one's looking for her.

11:30.994 --> 11:33.214
We do think we know how
George booked the girls.

11:33.257 --> 11:34.998
He messaged
a burner phone yesterday.

11:35.042 --> 11:36.826
About a minute later,
the burner responded

11:36.870 --> 11:38.523
with pictures of girls
to choose from.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.351
- George tapped into that
same burner a minute

11:40.395 --> 11:42.484
after that 911 call
that he had with you.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.921
- So we're thinking pimp.
- More than likely.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.836
- All right,
so let's run with that.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.751
Have CPIC tear that
burner apart.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.013
I want names.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.188
Who are these girls?

11:51.232 --> 11:53.016
And who the hell
is running them?

11:53.060 --> 11:54.409
- Wanna take a ride?

11:54.452 --> 11:56.367
- Tied to a desk.
- Rojas?

11:56.411 --> 11:57.804
- Yeah, let's go.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.197
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:00.241 --> 12:01.982
- Whoever your burner
belongs to,

12:02.025 --> 12:03.200
he's definitely doing
something illegal,

12:03.244 --> 12:05.115
and he's doing it
real damn well.

12:05.159 --> 12:07.291
I worked his burner
top to bottom.

12:07.335 --> 12:10.033
Now, here are the movements
of his cell in the last month.

12:10.077 --> 12:12.209
Cell hardly ever stays on
for more than an hour,

12:12.253 --> 12:13.994
and when it is on,
it pings

12:14.037 --> 12:15.386
a different tower
clear across town.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.692
But...

12:16.736 --> 12:19.129
here are the movements
yesterday.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.479
Phone was right outside
your West Loop condo.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.352
- Which means pimp
drops off girls, waits outside.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.441
- Gets better.
After about 30 minutes,

12:26.484 --> 12:29.226
your burner synced
to your homicide victim's

12:29.270 --> 12:32.055
Wi-Fi hotspot, meaning--
- Pimp goes inside the condo.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.536
- Yup. He was inside
during time of death.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.625
Cell stayed on for about
20 more minutes after,

12:36.668 --> 12:39.323
went west, pinged a couple
of towers near Garfield,

12:39.367 --> 12:41.456
and then stopped to make
one final call.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.937
Call was to another burner,
lasted four minutes,

12:43.980 --> 12:45.416
and then both phones
shut off for good.

12:45.460 --> 12:48.463
- Can you show me
that last location?

12:48.506 --> 12:50.726
Last location of
the pimp's cell phone hit

12:50.770 --> 12:52.293
was pretty deserted.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.250
Zero traffic cams.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.599
We lucked out
with this hidden

12:54.643 --> 12:56.514
security camera.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.820
- This guy's smart.

12:57.864 --> 12:58.952
Checks for traffic cams

12:58.995 --> 13:01.128
before he pulls over.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.959
- Oh, come on,
step into the light.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.397
- There.

13:27.197 --> 13:28.590
- Whoa.

13:31.201 --> 13:33.813
- Daniel Lopez, 32.
Wanted in six states,

13:33.856 --> 13:35.075
and by the FBI.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.164
In connection to assault,
kidnapping,

13:37.207 --> 13:39.427
aggravated sexual assault,
and the trafficking across

13:39.470 --> 13:42.125
state lines of women and minors
by force, fraud,

13:42.169 --> 13:44.562
coercion, and violence.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.616
- Sergeant Marie Stilman,
Hank Voight.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.487
- Hey, I met you years ago.

13:56.531 --> 13:58.228
You caught a body of mine
down by the river.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.187
Young girl.
- Oh, yeah, I remember.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.972
- Uh, this is SA O'Brien,
rest of my team.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.365
- Sir.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.409
- Take it I don't
gotta do intros?

14:05.453 --> 14:07.672
- No, no.
Get in.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.500
- You all have had
the misfortune

14:09.544 --> 14:12.416
of landing in a cell
of what we have named,

14:12.460 --> 14:15.376
and the FBI,
Operation "Cold Country."

14:15.419 --> 14:17.900
It's a midsize
human trafficking network

14:17.944 --> 14:19.249
operating in the Midwest.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.034
The ring recruits
domestic girls.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.426
Homeless teenagers.
Runaways.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.906
- You say recruits.
Romeo tactics?

14:23.950 --> 14:24.951
- Right on the money.

14:24.994 --> 14:25.995
Only, ain't really Romeos.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.649
More like Juliets.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.694
- So they're using their own
girls to recruit new ones?

14:29.738 --> 14:31.261
- And it's sweet,
for about a hot minute.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.436
But before you know it,

14:32.480 --> 14:33.698
the girls are addicted
to heroin,

14:33.742 --> 14:35.962
raped, beaten, held, pimped.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.180
- They move the girls.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.921
Every couple of months,
a new state.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.097
Avoids the police and keeps
the girls in the dark.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.533
They never know where they are.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.840
- But we have ID'd your man
Daniel Lopez.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.581
He's a trusted
mid-level trafficker.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.539
- How long before he starts
moving girls

14:48.583 --> 14:49.932
across state lines?

14:49.976 --> 14:52.326
- Daniel's probably
shaking now, laying low,

14:52.369 --> 14:53.936
but the ring's big enough.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.503
He'll need time to move it.

14:55.546 --> 14:56.765
And they'll have bookings.

14:56.808 --> 14:58.767
They don't want
to leave money behind.

14:58.810 --> 15:02.858
All of which is me saying,
I got no idea.

15:04.294 --> 15:07.123
We provide our files,
all our support,

15:07.167 --> 15:08.690
we run it together.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.867
We get the girls and the pimps
so we can flip them up,

15:11.911 --> 15:12.650
you get the murder.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.478
- We can work with that.

15:14.522 --> 15:17.003
- Great, thank you.
- Thank you.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.526
Dig in.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.963
- Agent O'Brien.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.443
You got any idea
who I spoke to?

15:22.486 --> 15:24.184
- No, but she's probably new.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.620
Probably being broken in
by Daniel

15:25.663 --> 15:26.969
and the other girl there.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.101
Fact that she called you

15:28.144 --> 15:29.580
means she hasn't
been held long.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.887
These guys are damn good
at breaking them.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.980
- Okay, we got more files
from Wisconsin.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.156
- These are some of the girls
that the FBI believes

15:40.200 --> 15:42.332
may be in the ring--
pulled off johns' cells,

15:42.376 --> 15:43.986
booking pages.
We're still trying to ID.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.988
- Anything?
- We can't even figure out

15:46.032 --> 15:48.686
their names yet.
- Yeah, FBI wasn't kidding.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.514
They got johns, they got cells,

15:50.558 --> 15:53.300
they got money flow--
they got nowhere.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.041
Johns didn't know
who they were hiring

15:55.084 --> 15:56.956
or who they were hiring from.
- Whoa.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.089
Mira Davis, 20 years old.
- Hey, check this box here.

16:00.133 --> 16:03.005
- I've got her booking photo
right here.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.051
Guys, this is a recent arrest,
and Vice booked her

16:05.094 --> 16:06.313
like two months ago.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.531
- Yo, three years ago,
the FBI

16:07.575 --> 16:08.968
linked her to a couple
of johns' phones

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
that booked off
confirmed traffickers,

16:11.057 --> 16:13.102
and Daniel Lopez himself
used a fake name

16:13.146 --> 16:15.365
to bail her out in Ohio.

16:15.409 --> 16:16.801
Yeah, she was definitely
in this ring.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.542
- Well, she's not anymore.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.066
She was arrested
on the Cicero stroll.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.981
There's no way she'd
be working that track

16:22.024 --> 16:23.591
if they still got her.
- Okay, maybe she found

16:23.634 --> 16:25.027
a way out.
- If she found a way out,

16:25.071 --> 16:27.464
maybe she can tell us
what it's like to be in.

16:31.077 --> 16:34.123
- All you cops think
you're so smart!

16:34.167 --> 16:37.474
Oh, you think you're smart?
I got nothing for you.

16:37.518 --> 16:39.041
Hey, honest to God.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.912
Honest to God, please just
throw me in the tank.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.566
I don't want the lady cop.
Please.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.221
Hey, hey, baby.
Tell him I ain't got no pimp.

16:45.265 --> 16:46.483
No dealer.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.876
You ain't getting a pimp
from me,

16:47.919 --> 16:50.661
so toss me in the tank.
I'll bail out.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.538
Fine.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.148
I don't want
the bologna sandwich.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.672
I don't and won't eat animals.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.762
- All right, hey,
get the laces upstairs.

17:05.807 --> 17:06.982
- Easy.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.944
Got a pop or something?
- Yeah.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.598
Sure, we can get you one.
- Nah.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.209
On second thought, it's cool.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.211
I'll just drink the grease.

17:21.605 --> 17:24.043
Up for grabs.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.435
- Mira, three years ago,

17:25.479 --> 17:28.047
you fell off
the face of the map.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.875
Social media stopped,
school records, no address,

17:30.919 --> 17:33.356
no credit cards, no anything--
it's like you disappeared.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.879
- What?

17:34.923 --> 17:37.317
- Only trace of you
are these arrest records.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.535
One in Ohio.

17:38.579 --> 17:41.364
Few weeks later,
Missouri, Wisconsin.

17:41.408 --> 17:42.626
Police never had enough
to charge,

17:42.670 --> 17:44.802
but for three whole years,

17:44.846 --> 17:48.067
this is all we have
left of you.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.807
Where were you?

17:49.851 --> 17:51.766
- I was with a boyfriend.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.898
- Yeah, who?
- I don't remember his name.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.117
- You don't know
the guy's name?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.945
- Nah, I got a lot
of boyfriends.

17:56.988 --> 17:59.165
- Okay, where did he live?
- Why, you want a date?

18:00.905 --> 18:03.995
- Mira, is this boyfriend
the one who gave you the scars?

18:05.649 --> 18:07.782
- No.

18:07.825 --> 18:13.353
I let men tie me up,
choke me, hit me.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.050
Pays more.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.663
- I think you were being held.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.361
And I think you were trafficked
across state lines

18:21.404 --> 18:25.843
by the same ring that's holding
girls in Chicago right now.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.759
Mira, I am trying to find them.

18:28.803 --> 18:32.067
This kid, she dialed 911,
and I wasn't there in time.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.982
So whatever you remember
can help me.

18:34.025 --> 18:36.158
- Help you save them?
- Yeah.

18:36.202 --> 18:40.206
- You can't save them.
They're already gone.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.212
Can't help you.

18:53.741 --> 18:55.003
- Have a seat.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.352
- There's not a doubt
in my mind.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.441
- I could see it.
She was there.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.574
- Then we gotta crack her.
Throw the book at her.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.315
Charge her.
- Yeah, she's going to jail.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.230
Besides soliciting,
she's got an open warrant.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.970
- If we charge her,
she won't talk.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.363
She doesn't need punishment,
she needs help.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.148
- This girl's undergone
complex trauma.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.454
You're not gonna break through
that cement with sweet talk.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.326
- Okay, then I run
at her again,

19:13.369 --> 19:16.720
but this time
with an offer as leverage.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.331
- What are you thinking?

19:18.374 --> 19:21.421
- We give her everything.
We just give her everything.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.031
- You can give her
damn near close to everything,

19:23.074 --> 19:24.772
doesn't mean she'll take it.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.774
Look, you bet on her heart,

19:26.817 --> 19:29.255
your lead might go up in smoke.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.782
- Put it all in writing.

19:36.436 --> 19:39.090
- Okay, good rehab,
sober living for three months,

19:39.134 --> 19:41.832
therapy, and a work program
run by a woman

19:41.876 --> 19:44.183
who got out of the game.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.576
- That a polite way
of saying "ex ho"?

19:46.620 --> 19:50.798
- Mira.
- What's the give?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.756
Give, get--
- You just talk to me.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.931
You tell me
about where you were,

19:53.975 --> 19:55.977
and you tell me about Daniel.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.413
- No thanks.
- Mira...

19:57.457 --> 20:00.242
- Let me save you a little
trouble on the next part,

20:00.286 --> 20:02.984
where you act like
I'm a damn weeping willow,

20:03.027 --> 20:07.075
a pussy you get crying
because of your sob story.

20:07.118 --> 20:10.687
You're gonna tell me
that you're on my side,

20:10.731 --> 20:12.646
how you can help.

20:12.689 --> 20:15.170
Tell me about your deep,
dark little past

20:15.214 --> 20:18.652
that made you wanna
be a lady cop.

20:18.695 --> 20:21.002
Your daddy touch you?

20:21.045 --> 20:23.134
Your little buddy
was murdered.

20:23.178 --> 20:26.790
You were raped
by the boy next door.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.272
Now you wanna save
all the little lost girls

20:30.316 --> 20:32.579
because of it.

20:32.622 --> 20:36.800
You're gonna save me
because you get it.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.672
You get me.

20:40.282 --> 20:44.765
But I know the script,
and I know you're a fake.

20:44.808 --> 20:48.203
I don't need you to save me.
I take care of myself.

20:53.861 --> 20:56.690
- Okay, you're right.
- Great.

20:56.733 --> 20:57.995
- I'm out of my league.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.388
I don't usually
work these cases.

20:59.432 --> 21:01.956
- Then let me out.
- And I don't get it.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.131
I don't have
some deep dark past

21:03.174 --> 21:04.567
that made me want
to become a cop.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.003
I became a cop
because I wanted to.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.179
I'm actually from St. Charles.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.877
- Yeah, I was supposed to have
a real different life

21:09.920 --> 21:12.140
than this, Mira--
college, marriage, and babies.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.229
When I told my family
that I wanted to be a cop,

21:14.273 --> 21:15.056
they laughed.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.318
My boyfriend at the time,

21:16.362 --> 21:18.538
he, um, asked me
if I needed attention.

21:18.581 --> 21:20.670
Everyone at the academy
told me I was a bad fit.

21:20.714 --> 21:21.845
And for like two years,

21:21.889 --> 21:23.194
every time I did
something right,

21:23.238 --> 21:26.807
my FTO looked at me
with complete shock.

21:26.850 --> 21:28.504
But I wanted it.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.550
I wanted to be something
different than I was.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.465
Knew I could.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.554
See, I don't think people
need to end up anywhere near

21:34.597 --> 21:36.382
where they started.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.083
- I want out.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.999
- Hmm.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.522
You don't need my help, Mira.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.045
I need yours.
- Out.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.438
- You already fought,
you already got away.

21:49.482 --> 21:50.831
- Let me out!

21:50.874 --> 21:52.311
- You fought to find a way
to live with it.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.964
- I'm not talking
to this bitch!

21:54.008 --> 21:55.357
- The girl who called me
is still fighting right now.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.228
She's in the place
that you were right now.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.665
- I'm not gonna
remember for you.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.883
- She is fighting
to save herself,

21:59.927 --> 22:01.058
and she's running out of time.

22:01.102 --> 22:02.625
I know that you
know that, Mira.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.192
I am a good cop.
I will find her.

22:04.235 --> 22:05.889
- You won't,
and I don't want to remember.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.239
- You have to, for her.
- I don't want to!

22:08.283 --> 22:10.894
- Damn it, Mira,
you look at this picture now!

22:29.348 --> 22:31.219
Please help me.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.664
- That's him.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.013
Daniel.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.015
- Yeah.

22:45.059 --> 22:48.149
- Keeps you high.
Never alone.

22:48.192 --> 22:51.674
Always someone watching.

22:51.718 --> 22:56.200
Even when we weren't working,
they were watching.

22:56.244 --> 23:00.204
You sleep on the floor,
starving.

23:01.728 --> 23:06.950
They see if you cry,
if you fight, if you sleep.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.695
- Where did they hold you?
- The ring has a house.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.654
Multiple bedrooms,
high ceilings,

23:14.697 --> 23:16.612
place felt urban, run-down.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.441
- They go for someplace buried,
Mira heard traffic.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.225
Highway nearby.
- Easy access.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.053
Less foot traffic.
- Mm.

23:23.097 --> 23:25.578
- But they never
let us outside.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.057
Except to get in the van.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.408
- Passenger vans transported
all the girls.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.279
Always the same van,
black Mercedes.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.846
- Running it right now.

23:32.889 --> 23:35.718
- But we need routes and how
often that van was moved.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.633
- I don't know,
I don't remember.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.243
- Mira, you're doing great.
- Half the time,

23:39.287 --> 23:41.550
the girls worked private calls,
half the time at a brothel.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.770
- Brothel was run out of a bar,
place was seedy,

23:43.813 --> 23:45.554
girls worked the back,
walked right in the front door.

23:45.598 --> 23:48.514
- How long of a drive
from the house?

23:48.557 --> 23:50.777
- Maybe five minutes?

23:50.820 --> 23:53.040
We always took the same way.
- Okay, that helps.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.694
Can you remember it?

23:57.087 --> 24:00.482
- I would look out the window,

24:00.526 --> 24:03.006
see cars passing.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.880
We'd follow a highway.
- Okay.

24:06.923 --> 24:08.490
- But they never got
on the highway.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.100
They took a parallel street.

24:10.144 --> 24:12.755
- There was a park,
on the right,

24:12.799 --> 24:15.149
with a playground.
- Okay.

24:15.192 --> 24:16.716
- Then bars.
- Bars.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.500
- All the signs
were in Spanish.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.763
- That helps too.

24:22.156 --> 24:25.289
- And there was a neon sign.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.813
"Cambio."

24:28.031 --> 24:30.556
I used it like a marker.

24:33.384 --> 24:37.345
See the sign, stop remembering.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.009
Nothing?

24:49.052 --> 24:50.793
- Starting to feel like
we're chasing ghosts.

24:50.837 --> 24:52.969
- Even if it doesn't exist now,
it did then.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.318
We'll find it.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.278
- Something will pop up.
Let's go this way.

24:57.321 --> 24:58.540
- We're looking
for information

24:58.584 --> 25:00.411
on a black passenger van
that was involved

25:00.455 --> 25:01.804
in a traffic accident
a couple months ago.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.589
- You mean the van
with the girls?

25:03.632 --> 25:05.155
- You saw a black van
with girls?

25:05.199 --> 25:06.548
- Comes every day.

25:06.592 --> 25:07.854
Girls stumble out,

25:07.897 --> 25:09.986
file into that hellhole
off 18th.

25:10.030 --> 25:13.033
- A bar?
- Guess you can call it that.

25:13.076 --> 25:14.991
Don't think anyone's
going there to drink.

25:15.035 --> 25:16.819
- Ma'am, if you can give us
any other information

25:16.863 --> 25:18.647
that might help--
a description of who's driving,

25:18.691 --> 25:20.475
what time it comes...
- I don't know.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.304
It's a black van.
Girls all look glazed.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.871
About it.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.576
- Okay, call 'em out.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.536
- Holding down the back exit.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.102
- Anchor on the north end.

25:39.146 --> 25:40.843
- All right, remember,
we keep eyes,

25:40.887 --> 25:43.063
we ID the van,
but we don't take it.

25:43.106 --> 25:46.370
All the girls might not
be inside.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.808
Everybody settle in.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.549
- Van.

25:53.595 --> 25:54.857
- We got eyes
on a black passenger van,

25:54.901 --> 25:57.904
plates Young David Henry 842.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.693
- Everybody just hold steady.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.704
- Sarge, we have confirmation
on eight girls.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.488
Three of them
potential juveniles.

26:17.532 --> 26:19.403
No sign of either Jane Doe.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.536
- Yeah, copy, I see 'em.

26:23.059 --> 26:26.236
All right, Kev, you're up.
Do your thing.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.911
- Tracker's up.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.744
- I want license plates
on every man that enters

26:55.788 --> 26:57.441
or exits that bar.

26:57.485 --> 26:59.356
ID every single one of 'em.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.967
- Absolutely, Sarge.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.233
- We got movement.
- We got girls leaving.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.061
Must have been a shift change.
- All right.

27:08.104 --> 27:11.455
Everybody just remember
your positions, stay loose,

27:11.499 --> 27:14.763
stay back, do not get burned.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.811
We'll have patrol
keep eyes on the bar.

27:18.854 --> 27:21.117
We follow that van
back to their house

27:21.161 --> 27:24.381
to the rest of the girls,
then we take 'em.

27:24.425 --> 27:25.905
- Copy.
- We got 'em.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.515
Pulling up on South Union.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.256
- All right, copy.
Pull back, Kev.

27:29.299 --> 27:32.694
Pull way back.
- You got it, falling back.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.957
Still got eyes, passing 19th.

27:35.001 --> 27:37.481
- We're two blocks west,
following pace.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.745
- Copy.
Reaching South Canalport.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.485
We're slowing down.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.680
- Sarge, they're taking
the girls inside.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.116
- Okay, no one approach.

28:03.159 --> 28:05.335
Atwater and Rojas,
throw down an anchor.

28:05.379 --> 28:06.597
The rest of us will gear up

28:06.641 --> 28:08.338
and we'll take 'em down
tonight.

28:08.382 --> 28:10.514
- We copy.
- Copy that.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.701
- Block's dark.
We're a go.

28:32.841 --> 28:35.757
- Back door's secure.
- Copy. Breach.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.765
- Go!

28:47.073 --> 28:48.901
- Got one down.
Door on my left. Move up.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.250
- Copy.

28:50.293 --> 28:51.555
- Go.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.037
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Get off of me!

28:55.081 --> 28:56.386
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Leave me alone!

28:56.430 --> 28:57.866
- Gun!

28:57.910 --> 28:59.738
- Got another one down!

29:10.313 --> 29:12.576
- Ruze, you okay?

29:12.620 --> 29:13.621
- Good.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.076
- Get you the hell
out of here, okay?

29:34.120 --> 29:37.079
All right?
Sit tight.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.607
- Only two girls upstairs.
- That's it?

29:43.651 --> 29:45.000
- Yeah.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.747
- Hey.

30:00.711 --> 30:03.323
- All right.
Let's watch your step, now.

30:03.366 --> 30:04.933
- Eighteen women,

30:04.977 --> 30:06.543
including the brunette
from the condo.

30:06.587 --> 30:09.068
Two dead offenders,
but our pimp Daniel isn't here.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.461
- Neither is the girl
who called me.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.420
She's not here.

30:22.298 --> 30:25.345
- Girls are all varying degrees
of high, coming down.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.999
- Look, the doctor said
we can question the girls

30:27.042 --> 30:28.130
but warned we might
not get very far.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.479
I say we try.

30:29.523 --> 30:30.872
- And the girl
who was in the condo?

30:30.916 --> 30:31.960
One who pretended
to be the wife?

30:32.004 --> 30:33.179
- Right, that's Natalie,

30:33.222 --> 30:34.441
she won't give intake
or last name.

30:34.484 --> 30:35.921
The girls seemed
really scared of her.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.271
- No physical signs of abuse
like the other girls.

30:38.314 --> 30:39.663
But she has scars
that are years old,

30:39.707 --> 30:41.143
which confirms
what O'Brien said.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.405
She's probably working
with Daniel,

30:42.449 --> 30:43.929
keeps the girls in line.

30:43.972 --> 30:47.410
- Victim turned abuser.
- Let's go talk to her.

30:47.454 --> 30:50.761
- But you're wrong.
Don't matter how you say it.

30:50.805 --> 30:53.764
We didn't do nothing bad.
We're helping those girls.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.376
- All right, you know what?
You might be right.

30:57.681 --> 30:58.769
- The thing is,

30:58.813 --> 31:00.423
the girls are saying
something different.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.990
- If they're talking,
they're lying.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.601
- They're saying Daniel killed
a man a couple days ago.

31:04.645 --> 31:07.561
A john named George Weller.

31:07.604 --> 31:11.608
Uh-oh. Hmm.
You believe 'em, huh?

31:11.652 --> 31:14.481
They wrap you round and round
and chew you up.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.178
That's why you have
to keep them in line.

31:16.222 --> 31:19.268
- Sure, of course.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.880
So tell us
what really happened, Natalie.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.320
- No.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.715
- All right, fine.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.761
Charge Daniel,
release the rest of 'em.

31:33.804 --> 31:34.980
- It wasn't his fault.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.069
- Yeah, well,
I don't know that.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.986
Natalie, I can't help Daniel

31:41.029 --> 31:43.292
if you don't tell me
the real story.

31:46.034 --> 31:48.732
- It was Baby's fault.
- Baby?

31:48.776 --> 31:50.169
- Mm-hmm.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.478
- Is this Baby?
- Mm-hmm.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.133
- Yeah? It is?
Okay, what's her real name?

31:58.177 --> 32:00.266
- Baby.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.050
She needed
to be there, working.

32:02.094 --> 32:06.141
But she goes crazy, calls 911.
So Daniel had to shut her up.

32:06.185 --> 32:07.838
He had to beat her.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.754
To help her.
That's what you have to do.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.148
- All right,
so Baby called 911, cops came.

32:13.192 --> 32:16.238
What happened
after the cops left?

32:16.282 --> 32:17.674
- George saw Baby.

32:17.718 --> 32:20.677
Didn't like the blood.
Didn't get it.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.157
He followed us.

32:22.201 --> 32:25.117
Baby was screaming,
acting crazy.

32:25.160 --> 32:28.163
So George thought
something was wrong.

32:28.207 --> 32:31.123
See?
Daniel didn't have no choice.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.342
It was Baby's fault.

32:33.386 --> 32:35.170
- Where are Baby
and Daniel now?

32:36.867 --> 32:40.436
- He had to take her.
- Take her where?

32:40.480 --> 32:43.396
- To break her.
- Where?

32:43.439 --> 32:45.833
Where, Natalie?

32:45.876 --> 32:47.139
- Hmph.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.619
- Daniel's taken other girls
before to break 'em.

32:49.663 --> 32:51.578
Where did he take 'em, then?

32:57.627 --> 33:00.239
Where did he take you, Natalie?

33:03.590 --> 33:06.897
- I don't know,
he just takes you.

33:12.338 --> 33:13.904
- We just interviewed
every girl at Chicago Med

33:13.948 --> 33:15.471
and half of them didn't know
who we were

33:15.515 --> 33:16.907
or what the hell was going on,

33:16.951 --> 33:18.822
but a couple of them said
something about motels.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.476
- And they said Daniel
would separate them,

33:20.520 --> 33:22.043
take them to a cheap motel
by the highway

33:22.087 --> 33:23.697
if they stepped out of line.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.091
- They did remember traffic,
said it wasn't far at all.

33:26.134 --> 33:27.570
It's not much...
- But it's good.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.703
It's more than we've got.
- Now we do have a grid.

33:29.746 --> 33:30.834
- Yeah.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.140
- So we'll do it
the old-fashioned way.

33:32.184 --> 33:33.750
Boots on the ground.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.535
Rule out these motels
one by one.

33:35.578 --> 33:39.017
I'll see if Trudy
can spare some bodies.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.409
- Here.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.123
- Struck out
at the Shamrock Hotel,

33:58.166 --> 33:59.385
no guest matching
our description.

33:59.428 --> 34:01.169
I'm gonna move west.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.084
- Nothing here, all vacancies.

34:03.128 --> 34:04.129
- Anything?
- Mm-mm.

34:04.172 --> 34:05.695
- Thank you.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.439
- No, I'm sorry.

34:10.483 --> 34:12.354
We just got those two families
filled up tonight.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.616
- If you do see her...

34:15.966 --> 34:17.838
Kim Burgess.
- Detective Burgess.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.448
This is Jimmy from dispatch.
- Hey, Jimmy, is it urgent?

34:19.492 --> 34:20.928
- Yeah, I--
it's weird.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.538
I just got a 911 call
from a cell,

34:22.582 --> 34:24.105
it was just breathing
on the line,

34:24.149 --> 34:25.715
but the cell number
popped in our system.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.108
Intelligence has
a trap/trace on it.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.979
- What are you talking about?
What number?

34:29.023 --> 34:30.285
- Cell phone's registered
to a George Weller

34:30.329 --> 34:31.852
a homicide victim?

34:31.895 --> 34:33.462
- Yeah, we didn't recover
a cell phone at the scene.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.769
We thought the killer
might have stolen...

34:35.812 --> 34:37.075
She has it.

34:37.118 --> 34:38.598
Jimmy, can you trace
the location of the call?

34:38.641 --> 34:40.339
- Yeah, it's pinging off
94 and Pulaski.

34:40.382 --> 34:41.731
- Great.
Is there a motel near there?

34:41.775 --> 34:43.385
- Yeah. Cindy Lyn Motel.
- Cool.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.692
- Whoa, hey, detective.
You want me to transfer you?

34:45.735 --> 34:47.128
- You still have the line open?
- Yeah.

34:47.172 --> 34:50.653
- Yes, yes, transfer me.
- Okay, stand by.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.655
- 5021 Eddie, I
need a flash message sent

34:52.699 --> 34:54.222
to Intelligence and citywide.

34:54.266 --> 34:55.832
I have confirmation
that a Jane Doe victim

34:55.876 --> 34:57.573
is in the Cindy Lyn Motel
off 94.

34:57.617 --> 34:59.271
I need all cars
to meet me there in response.

34:59.314 --> 35:01.751
- Copy, 5021 Eddie.

35:01.795 --> 35:05.625
- 911, you're on the line.
- Hello? Hello?

35:05.668 --> 35:07.322
This is Officer Burgess,
I answered your call

35:07.366 --> 35:08.323
two days ago.

35:08.367 --> 35:09.672
I told you to hang on.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.674
I've been looking for you.
- Hello?

35:11.718 --> 35:12.936
- Hi, can you tell me
where you are?

35:12.980 --> 35:14.329
Can you tell me
what's happening?

35:14.373 --> 35:16.157
- A motel.
Room 8.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.854
He said to take a shower.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.553
He thinks I'm taking one.
- Okay, good.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.294
That's really good.
Look, I'm on my way.

35:22.337 --> 35:23.904
Who's there with you?

35:23.947 --> 35:26.036
- Daniel.
- All right.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.126
Stay where you are,
and lock the door if you can.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.997
What's your name?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.739
- Emma.
- Hi, Emma, I'm Kim.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.044
I'm gonna stay on the line.

35:34.088 --> 35:35.524
You don't have to
say anything, okay?

35:35.568 --> 35:37.352
Don't say anything.
I'm almost there.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.485
I just need you to hang on.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.457
- Hey, Emma, I'm right here
with you, all right?

35:55.501 --> 35:57.590
Just hang on.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.204
This is Kim.
Where the hell are you guys?

36:03.248 --> 36:05.075
- Three minutes out.

36:05.119 --> 36:08.078
- I'm two minutes out.

36:08.122 --> 36:11.647
- Emma, I'm still here.
Just hang on.

36:11.691 --> 36:12.996
All right, I'm here.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.216
I can't go in.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.478
- I need you guys to get here.

36:16.522 --> 36:19.307
I can't go in.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.657
- We're en route.
We'll be there ASAP.

36:27.707 --> 36:30.449
- Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

36:31.885 --> 36:33.626
- No!

37:11.925 --> 37:13.796
Emma!

37:25.286 --> 37:26.374
Ah!

37:40.432 --> 37:42.956
Come on.

37:42.999 --> 37:45.393
You're okay.

37:45.437 --> 37:46.699
I'm here.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.918
Come on.
Emma, you're okay.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.881
- Chicago PD! Kim?
- Hailey.

37:54.924 --> 37:58.188
Please help her.
Please, please help her.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.365
- Okay.
- Come on.

38:00.408 --> 38:03.455
She needs CPR!
- Okay.

38:07.589 --> 38:10.200
- 5021 Henry, 10-1, 10-1,
I have an officer

38:10.244 --> 38:11.941
and a civilian down--
- Emma. Her name is Emma.

38:11.985 --> 38:13.247
- Need two ambos
to Cindy Lyn Motel.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.597
Kim, are you okay?

38:18.818 --> 38:19.993
- Okay, okay.

38:20.036 --> 38:20.994
- Kim!
Kim, are you all right?

38:21.037 --> 38:22.517
- Ruze!

38:22.561 --> 38:24.127
- I don't know.
I don't know.

38:24.171 --> 38:26.956
I don't know.
Help me, please, please.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.611
- Come on.
It's all right, come on.

38:32.222 --> 38:34.964
- It's all right.

38:36.052 --> 38:38.925
- Okay.
You're okay.

38:38.968 --> 38:42.842
- I can call anyone you'd like
to have come meet you.

38:42.885 --> 38:47.281
Um, family, or friends.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.501
I-I actually don't know
your full name.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.940
- Emma.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.203
I'm Emma Fuller.

38:57.683 --> 39:00.468
- Okay, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Jay.

39:04.385 --> 39:07.823
I'll be outside if you think
of anyone, okay?

39:07.867 --> 39:09.651
- Hey.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.179
Can you call my mom?

39:24.318 --> 39:25.275
- Anything?
- No.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.060
She's still being treated.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.105
- All right.
Call me.

39:29.149 --> 39:31.978
I'm gonna track down
Emma's family.

39:45.339 --> 39:47.820
- The abdominal trauma
you suffered was severe.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.605
Pregnancy was lost.
There's no heartbeat.

39:50.649 --> 39:53.173
I'm so very sorry.

39:55.175 --> 39:58.265
Kim, did you hear me?

40:00.659 --> 40:02.312
Kim.

40:02.356 --> 40:05.098
- Yes, I heard.

40:14.629 --> 40:16.588
- Thank you, Doc.

40:38.087 --> 40:40.742
- I'll be right here, Kim.

40:51.144 --> 40:54.147
Still right here.
