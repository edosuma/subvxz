I'M STILL AT THAT POINT THAT
I STILL GET THE BUTTERFLIES
WHEN I PUT THE UNIFORM ON

00:47.500 --> 00:48.767
AND HIT THE STREETS.

00:48.867 --> 00:51.533
IF YOU GET TOO COMFORTABLE
DOING WHAT WE DO FOR A LIVING,

00:51.633 --> 00:52.800
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET HURT.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.233
YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE
OF WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE,

00:55.333 --> 00:58.333
AND ALWAYS BE READY
TO REACT TO IT.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.133
AND NOT LET THE FEAR
CONTROL YOU.

01:01.233 --> 01:03.067

A CALL RIGHT NOW

01:03.167 --> 01:06.100

01:11.733 --> 01:13.367

01:21.233 --> 01:23.067
-WATCH HIS HANDS. YUP.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.233

01:24.333 --> 01:25.833
-WATCH YOURSELF, WATCH YOURSELF.
-HEY, HEY, HEY!

01:25.933 --> 01:27.200

-I DO WANT IT.
-THEN DO ME A FAVOR

01:38.233 --> 01:40.433
AND DROP THE KNIFE, AND I'LL

-JUST DROP IT, BUDDY.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.367
-I'M GONNA HELP YOU,
BUT I NEED YOU
TO DROP THE KNIFE.

01:42.467 --> 01:43.400
-NO, YOU'RE NOT.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.733
-I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.267

01:54.100 --> 01:56.467
YOU'RE GONNA ROLL AROUND
LIKE A FISH.

01:56.567 --> 01:59.067
YOU'LL ROLL AROUND
JUST LIKE A FISH.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.600
DROP THE KNIFE.

02:01.933 --> 02:03.500
-WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

02:04.733 --> 02:06.833
LISTEN, WE'RE NOT HERE
TO DO ANYTHING BAD TO YOU.

02:06.933 --> 02:08.367
WE DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.167
WE'RE HERE 'CAUSE

02:10.267 --> 02:11.833

02:24.200 --> 02:25.700
HE'S WALKING AWAY.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.867
GRAY SHIRT, BLACK BACKPACK,
HE'S GOT THE KNIFE IN
HIS RIGHT HAND.

02:28.967 --> 02:30.267

02:30.367 --> 02:31.367
ALBA, NOT TOO CLOSE.
-DAVE!

02:31.467 --> 02:33.533

GET IN TACO BELL,

02:33.633 --> 02:35.600
SO YOU BETTER NOT WALK
TOWARDS OVER THERE.
-STOP RIGHT THERE.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.767
HE'S WALKING BACK OUT
TOWARDS BOULDER NOW.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.900
-DAVE! YOU'RE NOT WALKING
IN THERE WITH THAT KNIFE.

02:41.067 --> 02:42.567
-ALBA, DON'T GET

BOULDER NOW

02:56.167 --> 02:58.900

YOU'RE JUST BEING CHILDISH NOW.

03:02.367 --> 03:06.200
YOU GOT 10 COPS CHASING YOU,
AND WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.067
-JIM, IF YOU GOTTA HIT HIM
WITH A LITTLE LETHAL, HIT HIM
WITH A LITTLE LETHAL,

03:09.133 --> 03:10.233
BUT KEEP WALKING NEXT TO HIM.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.533
THERE'S NOBODY AROUND HIM.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.467
-HE DROPPED IT!
HE DROPPED IT!
HE DROPPED IT!

03:13.567 --> 03:15.067
TURN AROUND THAT WAY!

03:15.100 --> 03:16.800
-TURN AROUND!
-FACE THE WALL.

03:16.900 --> 03:18.633
HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

03:18.733 --> 03:19.767

03:19.867 --> 03:22.367
-GET ON YOUR KNEES, NOW!

03:22.467 --> 03:23.733
-GOT IT?

03:25.233 --> 03:27.267
-SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

03:27.367 --> 03:28.433

YOUR KNEES, NOW.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.233
GET ON YOUR KNEES NOW!

03:34.533 --> 03:37.067

DID YOU WANT NORTH
OR SOUTH SHUT DOWN?

03:39.933 --> 03:42.733
-YOU CAN DISREGARD LAST.
HE'S IN CUSTODY.
WE'RE CODE FOUR.

03:45.567 --> 03:47.300
THANK YOU.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.200
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GET HURT.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.867

03:50.967 --> 03:53.133
-YEAH.
-YOU ALL RIGHT?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.833

03:55.933 --> 03:57.733
BRING YOUR KNEES UP,
THEN COME ON UP.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.900
THERE YOU GO.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.100
YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.200
-WHY WERE YOU RUNNING
AROUND WITH A KNIFE?

04:04.300 --> 04:05.500
-I WANTED TO KILL MYSELF.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.667
-WHAT'S MAKING YOU
FEEL THAT WAY?

04:06.767 --> 04:09.100
-NO FAMILY, I'M HOMELESS,
NO ONE TO HELP.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.067
I CAN'T GET A JOB,
I DON'T HAVE A PHONE,

04:11.133 --> 04:12.267
I HAVE WARTS.

04:12.367 --> 04:14.433
-EVER TRIED ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE?
-YEAH.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.133
-WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TRIED IT?

04:16.233 --> 04:17.167
-COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

04:17.267 --> 04:18.333
-WHAT'D YOU TRY AND DO?

04:18.433 --> 04:19.400
-SAME THING.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.500
-DID YOU HAVE A KNIFE?

04:20.600 --> 04:21.533
-YEAH.
-POLICE COME?

04:21.633 --> 04:22.733
-YEAH.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.333
-THEY HIT YOU
WITH A BEAN BAG OR TASE YOU?
-NO.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.267
-IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT,
OR DID YOU WANT TO BE SHOT?

04:28.367 --> 04:29.967
-PROBABLY SHOT.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.233
-THAT'S NOT A PRETTY SIGHT, BUD.

04:35.333 --> 04:37.733
IT'S NOT FAIR
TO US, EITHER, RIGHT?

04:37.833 --> 04:40.067
-LAST TIME, WHEN THEY
TALKED TO YOU--
-YOU DO IT ALL THE TIME,

04:40.100 --> 04:41.767
SO WHY NOT--
-NO, WE DON'T
DO IT ALL THE TIME.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.367
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

04:43.467 --> 04:45.867
I COULD HAVE SHOT YOU
BACK THERE, BUT THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN, DID IT?

04:45.967 --> 04:47.233
-NO.
-I TRIED TALKING TO YOU.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.700
YES, YOU DID,
YOU HAD THE KNIFE IN YOUR HAND.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.267
-SO, YOU AIN'T GONNA
SHOOT SOMEBODY IF HE'S GOT
A KNIFE IN HIS (bleep) HAND.

04:52.367 --> 04:55.100
-IF I GET THAT CLOSE,
OR YOU GET THAT CLOSE TO ME,

04:55.200 --> 04:57.500
WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE?

04:57.600 --> 04:59.533
-SO, YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME
'CAUSE I HAVE A KNIFE?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.433
-'CAUSE YOU'RE HOLDING
A KNIFE AGGRESSIVELY.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.500
-YOU DON'T BRING
A GUN TO A KNIFE SHOW, BRO.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.200
-YOU SHOULDN'T.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.333
AND I'M NOT YOUR BRO.
I TRIED HELPING YOU.

05:08.433 --> 05:11.067
INSTEAD, YOU RAN OFF,
AND THEN YOU RAN
THROUGH TRAFFIC,

05:11.167 --> 05:13.300
PUTTING EVERYBODY ELSE'S
LIVES IN DANGER.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.133
DAVE, I'M BEING SERIOUS HERE.

05:15.233 --> 05:17.300
YOU DON'T SEE THE BIG DEAL
WITH YOU HAVING A KNIFE

05:17.400 --> 05:18.800
AND HOLDING IT THE WAY YOU WERE,

05:18.900 --> 05:21.600
AND ME ASKING YOU TO DROP IT
SO THAT I COULD TALK TO YOU?

05:21.700 --> 05:24.500
YOU THOUGHT THAT--
YOU THINK THAT'S NORMAL?

05:24.600 --> 05:26.567
-YOU DON'T SHOOT
A GUY WITH A KNIFE, DUDE.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.467
-SO, YOU HELD A KNIFE
BECAUSE YOU WERE TESTING ME?

05:28.567 --> 05:29.700
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
-YEAH.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.367
I DID ALL THAT--
I DID ALL THIS FOR A (bleep)...

05:32.467 --> 05:33.800
JUST-- JUST--
-JUST TO TEST THE POLICE?

05:33.900 --> 05:35.667
-JUST TO SEE IF YOU GUYS
WOULD SHOOT ME. REALLY?
-OKAY.

05:35.767 --> 05:36.700
I'M ASKING YOU!

05:36.800 --> 05:38.067
-I'M NOT THAT
(bleep) DUMB, DUDE.

05:38.167 --> 05:39.433
-ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS TALK TO ME.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.267
IF YOU NEED HELP,
WE'LL GET YOU HELP.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.133
-I'LL TAKE THOSE CUFFS OFF.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.767
-DO YOU WANT TO GO
TALK TO A DOCTOR?

05:47.867 --> 05:49.300
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.100
-IF YOU ASKED ME
IF I WAS HOMELESS,

05:51.200 --> 05:52.933
IF I TOLD YOU NO,

05:53.067 --> 05:54.333
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
I WAS HOMELESS.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.100
-NO. YOU DON'T
LOOK HOMELESS TO ME.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.733
-I HEAR A LOT OF THAT,
AND IT'S JUST...

05:57.833 --> 06:03.067
I-- EVERY DAY FOR ME
IS LIKE A JOB.

06:03.167 --> 06:05.967
TO-- TO STAY...

06:06.067 --> 06:07.867
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.233
-TO LOOK NORMAL, GET BY.

06:09.333 --> 06:13.067
-I MEAN, I KEEP MYSELF GROOMED,
CLEAN, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

06:13.100 --> 06:14.433
SMELL GOOD,

06:14.533 --> 06:16.967
SO I DON'T LOOK LIKE
SOME OF THEM--

06:17.067 --> 06:20.067
SOME OF THE BAD HOMELESS PEOPLE
OUT HERE IN VEGAS.
-RIGHT. RIGHT.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.067
-SO, THAT'S JUST
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO.

06:22.167 --> 06:23.533
-OKAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.700
WE WANNA HELP YOU.
I REALLY DO WANT TO HELP YOU.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.467
-OKAY.
-I KNOW YOU PROBABLY--
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY,

06:27.567 --> 06:28.967
AND YOU HAVEN'T
HAD HELP IN THE PAST.

06:29.067 --> 06:30.933
WE'RE GONNA DO THE BEST
WE CAN TO GET YOU
SOME HELP TONIGHT.

06:31.067 --> 06:32.733
-OKAY.
-THERE'S A LOT
OF OUTREACH PROGRAMS.

06:32.833 --> 06:35.333
WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO
THE HOSPITAL, MAYBE THEY CAN
GIVE YOU SOME RESOURCES ON IT.

06:35.433 --> 06:40.067
-THERE IS. I'VE BEEN KICKED OUT
OF ALL THE HOMELESS SHELTERS
FOR FIGHTING

06:40.133 --> 06:43.967
'CAUSE I WAS-- I USED TO BE
A UFC FIGHTER.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.500
SO, I COULD--
I COULD TAKE CARE
OF MY OWN.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.200
-YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH
THE AMBULANCE,

06:48.300 --> 06:49.767
YOU'RE GONNA GET EVALUATED.
-THANK YOU GUYS.

06:49.867 --> 06:50.900
-OKAY?
-GO AND GET SOME HELP.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.200
-I'M GONNA HELP YOU
GET THE HELP YOU NEED.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.133
LISTEN, ON THE REAL,
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.800
-ALL RIGHT.
-HONESTLY. THAT'S THE CLOSEST
I'VE BEEN IN A LONG TIME.

06:56.900 --> 06:59.333
THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN SHOT
AND I'M GLAD I DIDN'T DO IT.

06:59.433 --> 07:01.300
-ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.
-TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
ALL RIGHT?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.300
IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE TROUBLE
AND YOU CALL, NO MORE KNIVES.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.433
ALL RIGHT?
-YES, SIR.

07:06.567 --> 07:08.067
-WENT FROM BEING IN
THE MILITARY.

07:08.133 --> 07:10.067
GROWING UP WITH
A COP AS A DAD,

07:10.133 --> 07:11.900
AND AN UNCLE AS A COP,

07:12.067 --> 07:13.933
IS A REAL GOOD EXPERIENCE.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.633
KIND OF LED ME
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.200
SO, I JOINED THE P.D.
THREE YEARS AGO.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.333
STOCKTON'S A BUSY CITY
TO WORK FOR.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.200
IT'S NON-STOP, FAST-PACED.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.500
IT'S A GREAT CITY.
ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.733
SOMEONE'S NEIGHBOR SAW
AN INDIVIDUAL GETTING
INTO THEIR CAR.

07:28.833 --> 07:32.400
THAT PERSON DECIDED
TO PIN THAT PERSON DOWN

07:32.500 --> 07:34.467
AND HOLD HIM UNTIL
WE GET THERE.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.067
-(groaning)
-I GOT HIM.
GO AHEAD AND RELEASE.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.933
STAY ON THE GROUND.
STAY ON THE GROUND.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.333
-AAH!
-STOP KICKING.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.233
-WHAT'D I DO?
-PUT YOUR LEGS OUT
IN FRONT OF YOU.

07:49.333 --> 07:50.833
-WHAT'D I DO?
-PUT YOUR LEGS
OUT BEHIND YOU.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.067

WHEN I SEEN HIM,
HE DID THIS.

10:52.567 --> 10:53.833
HE LOOKED AT ME
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

10:53.933 --> 10:55.333
-OKAY.

10:55.433 --> 10:57.467
-SO, I'M LIKE, "HEY,

10:57.567 --> 11:00.100
HE WAS LIKE, "OH, NO, BRO,
THEY TOLD ME TO COME HERE."

11:00.200 --> 11:02.100
I'M LIKE, "NOPE.
THIS AIN'T YOUR CAR."

11:02.200 --> 11:04.633

YOU KNOW, FROM HERE.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.833
-WHO TIED HIS FEET UP?

11:06.933 --> 11:09.167

11:09.267 --> 11:11.633
-SO, HE ENDED UP TAKING
CONTROL OF HIS ARMS
AND STUFF,

11:11.733 --> 11:13.133

-OKAY.
-SO, YOU KNOW,
HE'S KINDA STRETCHED OUT,

11:19.833 --> 11:20.933

-WHAT ABOUT ORIGINALLY?
WAS HE FIGHTING WITH YOU?

11:22.667 --> 11:24.567

WITH HIM, YES.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.333

TO NUMEROUS OTHER
BURGLARY CASES,

11:32.267 --> 11:34.067

-WE SAY WE'RE THE POLICE,
WHY'D YOU COME TO THE DOOR
WITH A KNIFE?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.867

-COME OVER HERE.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.367

14:52.467 --> 14:55.233
-BECAUSE HE CHOKED ME
AND HE HIT ME,

14:55.333 --> 14:57.633
SO I PULLED A KNIFE
BECAUSE HE KEEPS COMING AT ME,

14:57.733 --> 15:00.733
AND HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
CALL THE POLICE.

15:00.833 --> 15:02.100
-OKAY.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.633

-OKAY.
-I LET HIM COME BACK
THE FIRST TIME

15:08.067 --> 15:09.867
AND DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

15:09.967 --> 15:12.267
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
TO KEEP PUTTING HIS HANDS ON ME!

15:12.367 --> 15:13.500
-OKAY.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.667

15:19.200 --> 15:20.300
-WHAT WERE WE FIGHTING ABOUT?

15:20.400 --> 15:22.833
-BECAUSE I ASKED HIM
A QUESTION

15:22.933 --> 15:24.933
AND THEN HE STARTED
YELLING AT ME.

15:25.067 --> 15:28.300
-OKAY.
-AND THEN HE CHOKED
ME ON THE BED,

15:28.400 --> 15:29.700
AND HE PULLED MY HAIR.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.533
-BRING YOUR HEAD BACK
FOR ME. BRING YOUR HEAD BACK.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.233
OKAY, SO, THAT'S WHERE

15:36.333 --> 15:38.133
-YES.
-OKAY.

15:38.233 --> 15:42.067
-AND THEN I WAS
FIGHTING HIM BACK
BECAUSE HE'S STRONGER THAN ME.

15:42.133 --> 15:43.433
-OKAY.

15:43.533 --> 15:44.900
AND SO YOU GRABBED THE KNIFE?

15:45.067 --> 15:47.967
-I GRABBED THE KNIFE
IN HERE BECAUSE HE KEPT
COMING AT ME.

15:48.067 --> 15:50.800
-OKAY. DO YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT
OF ARGUMENTS LIKE THIS
ALL THE TIME?

15:50.900 --> 15:54.733
-YES. WE-- I CALLED THE POLICE
BEFORE BECAUSE I WANTED
HIM TO LEAVE.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.300
-OKAY.
-AND THEN HE LEFT,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.333
AND THEN I LET HIM COME BACK.
-OKAY.

15:58.433 --> 16:02.067
OKAY. SIT TIGHT FOR A MINUTE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.733
-I GO IN THE HOUSE,

16:03.833 --> 16:06.600
JUST TRYING TO GET MY (bleep)
AND SHE STARTS COMPLAINING
AND CUSSING AT ME

16:06.700 --> 16:08.867
ABOUT A CHECK
FROM THREE WEEKS AGO.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.167
WE'RE EXCHANGING WORDS,
OF COURSE, BACK AND FORTH,

16:11.267 --> 16:12.767
SHE'S SCREAMING AT ME.
AFTER THAT...
-OKAY.

16:12.867 --> 16:15.767
SHE GOES AND GRABS ME
ON MY THROAT, SHE HAS ME
ON MY THROAT,

16:15.867 --> 16:18.300
SO I GRAB HER, AND I RUSH
HER ASS TO THE BED.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.300
ONCE I GET HER ON THE BED,
I LET HER ASS GO.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.800
SHE'S STILL GOT ME
IN A LITTLE CHOKEHOLD.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.500
BUT I SAID, "HEY,
I'M OFF OF YOU, LET ME GO."

16:24.600 --> 16:26.133
SO, I GET MY ASS UP,

16:26.233 --> 16:28.433
AND I'M WALKING
INTO THE LIVING ROOM...
-MM-HMM.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.933
-"I PUT MY HANDS ON YOU
BECAUSE YOU PUT
YOUR HANDS ON ME."

16:31.067 --> 16:32.167
I SAID, "I'M CALLING THE COPS."

16:32.267 --> 16:33.600
SO, I START DIALING THEM,

16:33.700 --> 16:35.567
SHE GOES INTO THE KITCHEN
AND GRABS A KNIFE.

16:35.667 --> 16:37.367
I GO TO SIT ON
THE (bleep) COUCH,

16:37.467 --> 16:40.933
SHE LITERALLY PUSHED ME INTO
THIS LITTLE WEIRD-ASS ARMLOCK,

16:41.067 --> 16:42.867
AND PUTS THE KNIFE
TO MY THROAT.

16:42.967 --> 16:46.433
SO, OF COURSE, I WIGGLE
OUT OF THAT BY GRABBING HER
BY HER (bleep) HAIR. BOOM!

16:46.533 --> 16:48.633
BUT I CAN'T HEAR HER
BECAUSE SHE'S STILL SCREAMING,

16:48.733 --> 16:50.967
AND I GOT THE TIMERS
ON THE (bleep) PHONE.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.067
SO, THE WHOLE TIME
SHE'S STILL SCREAMING
AND SCREAMING.

16:53.167 --> 16:54.733
OF COURSE WE'RE EXCHANGING
BACK WORDS.

16:54.833 --> 16:58.167
"(bleep) YOU," "BITCH,"
"BITCH-ASS (bleep)."
(bleep) LIKE THAT. WHATEVER.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.800
BUT SHE STILL KEEPS JAMMING
THE (bleep) KNIFE--
THE KNIFE AT ME,

17:01.900 --> 17:03.633
ACTING LIKE SHE'S GETTING
READY TO STAB ME AND (bleep).

17:03.733 --> 17:05.333
-HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN DATING?

17:05.433 --> 17:06.833
-WE'RE MARRIED.
-OH, YOU'RE MARRIED.

17:06.933 --> 17:09.133
-WE'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR LIKE,
WHAT, THREE MONTHS NOW?
-OKAY.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.633
HOW LONG HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN
HAVING THESE ISSUES?

17:11.733 --> 17:13.967
-AFTER THE LAST TIME
SHE KICKED ME OUT,

17:14.067 --> 17:15.833
I WASN'T COMING BACK.
-MM-HMM.

17:15.933 --> 17:18.867
-BUT AFTER ALL THE (bleep)
TEXT MESSAGES-- I CAN SHOW YOU
ON MY PHONE RIGHT NOW--

17:18.967 --> 17:21.500
"BABY, I'M SORRY.
WHY WON'T YOU TALK TO ME?"
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.700
HEY, MAN, I'M COOL.
AND I TOLD HER, "HEY, I'M COOL."

17:23.800 --> 17:26.600
I'M SO COOL,
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO DEAL
WITH THIS (bleep) NO MORE.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.233
-ALL RIGHT, MAN. GIVE ME
ONE MINUTE. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
-YEAH, MAN.

17:29.333 --> 17:32.300
-OKAY, LET'S GO AHEAD AND 12-4,
AND THEN FELONY THREATS.

17:32.400 --> 17:36.567
-OKAY.
-I HOPE YOU DON'T BUY HIS
INNOCENT VICTIM ATTITUDE.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.600
I REALLY DON'T.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.433
-OKAY, SO HERE'S WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

17:40.533 --> 17:42.167
RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

17:42.267 --> 17:44.833
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
ASSAULT, 4TH DEGREE DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE AND FELONY THREATS.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.400
OKAY?
-WHAT AM I GOING TO JAIL FOR?
AND I DIDN'T THREATEN HIM.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.400
-ASSAULT, 4TH DEGREE
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,

17:49.500 --> 17:51.067
AND FELONY THREATS
BECAUSE OF THE KNIFE.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.533
OKAY?

17:52.633 --> 17:55.867
-SO, IF A MAN IS HITTING ME,
I CAN'T PICK ANYTHING UP?

17:57.633 --> 18:02.100
-THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE TO GO
BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE
AT THE TIME, OKAY?

18:02.200 --> 18:03.733
WE WEREN'T HERE.

18:03.833 --> 18:06.133
-COME ON.
-HOW IS HE NOT GOING TO JAIL
FOR CHOKING ME AND HITTING ME?

18:06.233 --> 18:09.167
-WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
OUTSIDE. OKAY?

18:09.267 --> 18:11.300
BUT THE PROBLEM IS--
-EVERY TIME THAT I'VE
CALLED THE POLICE,

18:11.400 --> 18:12.900
HE'S PUT HIS HANDS ON ME.

18:13.067 --> 18:14.200
HE PULLED MY HAIR OUT.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.633
-OKAY. YEAH,
YOU HAVE INJURIES.

18:15.733 --> 18:18.300
BUT THE LAST TIME I CAME
OUT HERE, LIKE, A MONTH AGO,

18:18.400 --> 18:20.067
I TOLD YOU TO GET
A PROTECTION ORDER AGAINST HIM.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.500
YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.
AND NOW WE'RE IN THIS
SITUATION NOW,

18:22.600 --> 18:24.267
AND YOU'VE GOT INJURIES,
HE'S GOT INJURIES,

18:24.367 --> 18:27.767
AND WE SHOW UP 'CAUSE
HE'S SAYING THAT YOU'RE
THREATENING TO STAB HIM,

18:27.867 --> 18:31.067
RIGHT? AND I OPEN THE DOOR,
AND YOU'RE HOLDING A KNIFE.

18:31.133 --> 18:32.467
RIGHT?

18:32.567 --> 18:34.300
COME ON OVER
TO THE CAR REAL QUICK.

18:36.600 --> 18:38.200
GO AND HAVE
A SEAT IN THERE.

18:39.633 --> 18:40.700
OKAY.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.067
-WHY ISN'T HE
GOING TO JAIL, TOO?
-HUH?

18:42.133 --> 18:43.700
-WHY AM I THE ONLY PERSON
GOING TO JAIL?

18:43.800 --> 18:45.633
IF HE HAS INJURIES,
AND I HAVE INJURIES,

18:45.733 --> 18:47.833
HOW IS THAT FAIR FOR HIM
NOT TO GO TO JAIL?

18:47.933 --> 18:50.467
-BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO OFF OF
WHO THE PRIMARY AGGRESSOR IS.

18:50.567 --> 18:51.867
OKAY?

18:51.967 --> 18:53.833
AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOOK IT
TO THE LEVEL WITH THE KNIFE.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.533
-YOU REALLY THINK THAT
I'M THE PRIMARY AGGRESSOR?

18:55.633 --> 18:57.167
-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

18:57.267 --> 18:58.533
-COME ON.
-I WASN'T HERE.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.767
I HAVE TO GO BASED ON
WHAT WE HAVE AT THE TIME.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.633
-EVERY TIME I'VE CALLED
THE POLICE IS BECAUSE HE'S PUT
HIS HANDS ON ME.

19:06.733 --> 19:08.233
-BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM
RIGHT THERE

19:08.333 --> 19:11.900
IS YOUR-- THAT FIRST SENTENCE.
"EVERY TIME I'VE CALLED
THE POLICE."

19:12.067 --> 19:13.933
WHY ARE YOU STILL WITH HIM?

19:14.067 --> 19:17.067
-BECAUSE I LET HIM STAY THERE
'CAUSE HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE
ANYWHERE TO STAY,

19:17.167 --> 19:18.567
AND I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE.

19:18.667 --> 19:21.700
-AND SO, WHY DO YOU KEEP
LETTING HIM IN?

19:21.800 --> 19:23.500
YOU CAN'T LET SOMEONE
LIVE WITH YOU,

19:23.600 --> 19:26.300
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
ONE DAY DECIDE THAT THEY
CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU ANYMORE.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.267
OKAY? WATCH YOUR KNEE.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.533
HOW LONG YOU SAY
YOU GUYS'VE BEEN MARRIED?
THREE MONTHS?

19:31.633 --> 19:32.667
-YEAH, THREE MONTHS.
-OKAY.

19:32.767 --> 19:34.100
CUT IT OFF.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:34.200 --> 19:35.967
NEXT TIME, YOU KNOW,
IF IT CAN GO--

19:36.067 --> 19:37.733
-NO. NO.
-IF IT CAN GO THIS FAR,

19:37.833 --> 19:39.367
-IMAGINE WHAT COULD
HAPPEN NEXT TIME.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.933
-WHERE SHE HAD THE KNIFE
TO MY THROAT, NEXT TO
MY JUGULAR,

19:42.067 --> 19:44.333
I ALREADY KNOW I'D HAVE BEEN
BLEEDING OUT UNTIL
YOU GUYS GOT HERE.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.767
YOU CAN'T STOP THAT.
-NO.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.267
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
GOOD LUCK TO YOU, OKAY?

19:47.367 --> 19:48.400
-ALL RIGHT.
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.

19:49.433 --> 19:50.433
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.533 --> 19:51.800
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.333
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.433 --> 19:54.700
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.800 --> 19:55.933
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:03.467 --> 20:04.967
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:05.067 --> 20:06.800
-(theme music playing)
