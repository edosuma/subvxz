01:10.083 --> 01:11.333
Get out of here! Scram!

01:11.750 --> 01:13.000
C'mon!

01:19.833 --> 01:21.458
Shut her up!

01:33.041 --> 01:35.750
What are you looking at?! I want
you in front!

01:35.750 --> 01:37.041
Move it, Chepe!

01:37.041 --> 01:38.208
I'm coming.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.333
Three... Two...

01:39.333 --> 01:40.208
One...

01:40.208 --> 01:41.083
Let's go!

01:43.833 --> 01:46.083
Out in front, Chepe!

02:15.875 --> 02:19.666
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

02:34.041 --> 02:36.083
Shoes on, now.

02:40.708 --> 02:44.291
- I'm not telling you again. -
I'm coming!

02:44.291 --> 02:45.375
Hurry up, everyone.

02:47.708 --> 02:49.833
What are you doing?

03:03.125 --> 03:04.708
Chepe?

03:08.333 --> 03:10.000
Chepe!

03:37.375 --> 03:42.000
Two besos, two chocolate
conchas,

03:42.791 --> 03:46.375
and two ojos de buey. How many
is that?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.750
A dozen.

03:48.750 --> 03:53.166
Today is a big day, why not make
it two dozen?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.541
Yeah, right?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.666
Can I?

04:09.875 --> 04:11.375
Hurry, come on.

04:23.208 --> 04:25.083
Good morning my loves.

04:25.416 --> 04:26.916
Everyone had a good breakfast?

04:26.916 --> 04:29.708
Everyone except for Papa. He
only took coffee.

04:29.708 --> 04:32.333
Straight home after school,
right?

04:32.333 --> 04:33.541
Yes.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.375
Where were you?

04:52.916 --> 04:54.208
Hop on.

05:14.083 --> 05:16.250
Better you get off here.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.125
Chepe, do I have to go?

05:21.125 --> 05:22.291
What did we agree?

05:22.291 --> 05:23.791
Just for a few days.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.208
Right, after that no one will
come poking around.

05:26.208 --> 05:29.125
And then I can work with you,
no?

05:29.625 --> 05:31.333
We'll see, Nico.

05:35.375 --> 05:38.041
- Morning, Director. - Good
morning.

06:02.166 --> 06:04.375
Stay close to the others.

06:08.125 --> 06:10.958
- Look, toys! - Hey, get back
here.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.833
WELCOME BACK STUDENTS!

06:56.291 --> 06:58.208
Silence!

06:58.916 --> 07:01.500
Silence, please.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.583
Silence is the foundation of
obedience.

07:07.583 --> 07:13.125
Obedience is the foundation of
discipline,

07:13.125 --> 07:13.166
Obedience is the foundation of
discipline,
and discipline is the foundation
of learning.

07:13.166 --> 07:19.083
and discipline is the foundation
of learning.

07:20.125 --> 07:26.541
So, let's review our rules,
shall we?

07:26.666 --> 07:28.791
Yeah!

07:28.791 --> 07:31.666
- Good morning. - I brought
enough for everyone.

07:33.250 --> 07:36.041
I'm glad to see that everyone -

07:36.041 --> 07:37.500
Uh... Mr. Juárez?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.083
Well, that almost everyone is
here.

07:41.083 --> 07:44.875
As you know, Mrs. Álvarez gave
birth to a baby boy,

07:44.875 --> 07:49.000
and two days ago decided to
become a full-time mother.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.166
Fortunately, we found Mr.
Juárez,

07:51.166 --> 07:52.333
He's from here in Matamoros,

07:52.333 --> 07:56.541
and he kindly took the job at
the last-minute.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.375
He's got a pulse, he's hired.

08:00.708 --> 08:03.666
There's not much I can say you
don't already know, so I'll be

08:03.666 --> 08:05.583
brief

08:05.583 --> 08:09.291
Although primary education is
mandatory and free,

08:09.291 --> 08:11.291
over half of our sixth graders

08:11.291 --> 08:14.291
are dropping out. We are
failing.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.291
According to our ENLACE test
scores we are the very worst.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.791
I'm sure you're all aware of
this by now,

08:19.791 --> 08:24.166
this year they approved an
incentive bonus

08:24.166 --> 08:26.666
for those who meet certain score
thresholds.

08:26.666 --> 08:31.208
If that can motivate us to do
our jobs just a little bit

08:31.208 --> 08:33.332
better.

08:33.332 --> 08:35.832
Let's not forget our kids, okay?

08:35.957 --> 08:40.832
So... Let's have a good year,
shall we?

08:49.333 --> 08:53.166
Do you smell that? Smells like
something.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.125
It smells like... trash.

09:00.375 --> 09:03.708
Hurry up! Quickly now!

09:03.708 --> 09:06.375
- We don't have much time! -
What happened to the desks?

09:06.375 --> 09:09.625
- Those aren't desks. - Why are
they upside down?

09:09.625 --> 09:11.000
They're lifeboats!

09:11.000 --> 09:13.208
And that's not the floor...

09:13.416 --> 09:14.083
It's the ocean!

09:14.083 --> 09:17.333
Each boat can only hold the same
number of passengers.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.125
Those who don't get into a boat
will drown.

09:20.125 --> 09:20.500
But be careful -

09:20.500 --> 09:23.500
If any boat has more passengers
than the others it will sink

09:23.500 --> 09:26.041
and everyone on board will
drown.

09:26.041 --> 09:29.083
There's 23 of us here and only
six boats,

09:29.083 --> 09:32.041
so, figure it out. Ready? Let's
go!

09:32.041 --> 09:34.041
Five... four...

09:34.041 --> 09:37.208
- Get in! - Three... two....!

09:37.625 --> 09:39.125
One!

09:39.750 --> 09:41.208
Come on!

09:41.750 --> 09:44.375
Don't worry! I'll save you!

09:47.166 --> 09:48.291
Help!

09:48.291 --> 09:52.041
Help me! Please! Someone help
me!

09:52.625 --> 09:54.541
Help... me...

10:32.875 --> 10:35.041
Now eight boats!

10:36.541 --> 10:39.041
What the hell is going on here?!

10:40.416 --> 10:43.208
There's one last passenger! Save
him!

10:43.208 --> 10:48.083
Five, four, three, two!

10:48.083 --> 10:50.708
No, he's too fat! We won't
float!

10:50.708 --> 10:52.083
He'll sink the boat!

10:53.291 --> 10:55.166
Wait wait -

10:55.500 --> 10:57.291
Why would he sink it?

10:57.291 --> 11:01.250
Here's an interesting question.

11:01.250 --> 11:03.166
What makes a boat float?

11:03.166 --> 11:08.125
Or what determines how much
weight a boat can hold?

11:08.125 --> 11:09.833
Anyone know?

11:09.833 --> 11:11.208
No one?

11:14.125 --> 11:16.166
Do you know?

11:19.041 --> 11:22.083
No... I don't know either.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.416
Yeah I don't know either.

11:24.416 --> 11:28.708
Where do we find answers to
things we don't know?

11:29.166 --> 11:31.041
How about the Internet?!

11:31.041 --> 11:34.875
- I believe there's a computer
lab? - Yes.

11:34.875 --> 11:37.708
It's out of service at the
moment.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.208
Okay.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.208
Where else can we find answers?

11:46.750 --> 11:49.208
We ask the teacher.

11:49.208 --> 11:53.041
We tried that but as you've seen
We don't know very much.

11:55.291 --> 11:56.666
How about books?

11:56.666 --> 11:59.166
Is the library in service?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.041
To the library! Let's go!

12:08.416 --> 12:10.708
Where's the library?

12:13.875 --> 12:16.083
Come on, let's go!

12:28.833 --> 12:33.500
- May I help you? - Yes
please... Mrs. Florita.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.250
We don't have any class visits
scheduled today.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.750
You don't have anything
scheduled for today.

12:39.750 --> 12:43.000
Procedure requires notifying the
library at least one day in

12:43.000 --> 12:44.625
advance,

12:44.625 --> 12:47.208
with desired reference materials
identified in advance.

12:47.208 --> 12:51.041
Yeah, yeah, but we'll be quick.
Where are the encyclopedias?

12:51.416 --> 12:54.708
- They're here in back, BUT - -
Come on!

12:54.708 --> 12:56.041
- This way. - Hey!

12:56.041 --> 12:59.208
No running, please.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.750
1974.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.541
What did we come for?

13:04.958 --> 13:06.666
Boats, barcos...

13:06.666 --> 13:07.000
Oh, man.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.541
There's no 'B'.

13:08.541 --> 13:12.458
There's no 'B'. Where else can
we look?

13:12.458 --> 13:15.708
How about 'F', for flotation?

13:32.083 --> 13:33.500
You know what?

13:33.500 --> 13:35.583
We don't need the encyclopedia.

13:35.583 --> 13:38.125
You can figure this out on your
own.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.125
Tell me.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.208
Why do...

13:44.291 --> 13:46.541
Why do things float?

13:47.625 --> 13:49.083
Anyone?

13:49.083 --> 13:51.541
Somebody. Just take a guess.

13:51.541 --> 13:53.708
It doesn't matter if you're
wrong,

13:53.708 --> 13:56.083
what matters is that you try.

13:56.083 --> 13:56.208
what matters is that you try.
In fact, I'd prefer you get it
wrong.

13:56.208 --> 13:59.000
In fact, I'd prefer you get it
wrong.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.125
Yeah, because when we make
mistakes

14:01.125 --> 14:04.208
we learn what we did wrong...

14:04.208 --> 14:07.125
...and that can help us learn
what's right.

14:07.125 --> 14:09.958
But, how will we get good
grades?

14:09.958 --> 14:11.125
What do grades matter?

14:11.125 --> 14:14.000
We need good grades to graduate,

14:14.000 --> 14:17.083
and so that our parents don't
get mad at us.

14:17.083 --> 14:18.458
That's all?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.750
Fine, that's easy.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.958
As of now, you all get a 10.

14:24.958 --> 14:28.083
At the end of the year, when you
get your report cards, you're

14:28.083 --> 14:30.875
all going to find there: your
10!

14:31.333 --> 14:32.333
I promise.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.500
Really. Got it?

14:33.500 --> 14:38.208
Now we can get back to the
important stuff.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.875
Who wants to be wrong first?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.208
Come on, who?

14:45.583 --> 14:47.208
No one?

14:51.958 --> 14:55.041
Have you ever had a class like
that before?

14:55.041 --> 14:56.750
I've never had a teacher like
that.

14:56.750 --> 15:00.958
- What were we supposed to
learn? - About boats, obviously.

15:00.958 --> 15:03.208
Do you think?

15:05.166 --> 15:07.666
- Walk with us, Romeo? - What?

15:07.666 --> 15:10.000
Don't worry, I can keep a
secret.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.541
No, it's just that...

15:12.541 --> 15:16.000
Have you noticed that Paloma
seems different this year?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.875
Um, it's called puberty.

15:20.416 --> 15:24.208
Heavy, no? Could be real silver.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.125
You can replace the mirror.

15:27.375 --> 15:29.208
Besides, I'm keeping it.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.416
What do you want for it?

15:37.833 --> 15:40.625
- Do you think he meant it? -
Why would he lie about something

15:40.625 --> 15:43.041
like that?

15:43.041 --> 15:43.166
like that?
Remember what he said? He wants
us to make mistakes.

15:43.166 --> 15:47.541
Remember what he said? He wants
us to make mistakes.

15:47.666 --> 15:51.458
If we don't have to be right,
it's okay if we're wrong,

15:51.458 --> 15:56.166
and if it's okay to be wrong, we
can't get a bad grade.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.875
I've never had a 10 before.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.125
Papa, your nose.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.083
It's nothing.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.083
Come help me unload.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.291
Ok.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.916
Fifteen minutes of cartoons
while I make lunch,

16:33.916 --> 16:36.083
and then it's homework time.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.291
Aren't you working the night
shift, mama?

16:40.291 --> 16:42.416
What are you doing up?

16:44.208 --> 16:46.416
PREGNANCY TEST

17:49.000 --> 17:50.125
Nico!

17:50.666 --> 17:52.541
The pretty boy.

17:52.541 --> 17:53.583
First day of school -

17:53.583 --> 17:54.208
How did it go, man?

17:54.208 --> 17:56.000
- Well - Last year, they
suspended him on the first day,

17:56.000 --> 17:58.041
right?

17:58.041 --> 18:00.250
It's not for him man, just like
his brother.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.625
Can't sit still, always on the
go.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.000
That's my Carlitos.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.666
Staring out the window,
doodling, getting in fights...

18:07.666 --> 18:11.166
Anything but paying attention,
am I right?

18:11.166 --> 18:15.416
But it's ok, Nico. You got us to
take care of you.

18:17.041 --> 18:19.208
You wanna learn from books...

18:19.625 --> 18:22.208
...or do you wanna learn from
"la vida"?

18:22.208 --> 18:26.208
This is the real school right
here, no?

18:29.458 --> 18:32.583
- We better get going. - Word.

18:33.958 --> 18:36.000
Let him carry it.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.083
Mr. Juárez.

19:02.083 --> 19:03.166
I missed you this morning at the
faculty meeting.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.041
I missed you this morning at the
faculty meeting.

19:05.041 --> 19:07.125
Yeah, I was... uh...

19:07.125 --> 19:10.125
I had a lot of rearranging to do
in my classroom.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.750
Yeah, I saw.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.083
You have something against
furniture?

19:14.083 --> 19:17.208
No... just... some.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.541
Like your desk, for instance.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.458
It's just I don't think I need a
desk.

19:23.458 --> 19:26.875
You have to have a desk. Every
teacher has to have one.

19:26.875 --> 19:30.041
Is there some rule written that
says I have to have a desk?

19:30.041 --> 19:32.625
It's not the kind of rule that's
written,

19:32.625 --> 19:35.125
but how will the students know
who's in charge?

19:35.125 --> 19:37.041
Who's the authority?

19:38.333 --> 19:38.791
Tell me -

19:38.791 --> 19:43.041
You turn your classroom into a
playground, what's next?

19:43.041 --> 19:45.750
Turn the playground into a
classroom?

19:49.750 --> 19:53.083
What's your story, professor?
What do you mean?

19:53.083 --> 19:56.000
This place, you know what they
call it?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.083
- "School of Punishment." -
Exactly.

19:58.083 --> 19:59.083
Yeah.

19:59.083 --> 20:02.041
Your name was the first on the
transfer list.

20:02.041 --> 20:04.041
The only name, in fact.

20:04.041 --> 20:07.125
You asked to come here.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.250
Why?

20:08.375 --> 20:09.708
well...

20:11.125 --> 20:12.875
Maybe I'm crazy?

20:15.583 --> 20:17.583
You're running from something.

20:18.166 --> 20:21.750
No, I just wanted to try
something different.

20:22.375 --> 20:23.750
Like what?

20:24.166 --> 20:26.041
I don't know.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.916
I'm still trying to figure that
out.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.666
Well, perhaps this is the place
to do it.

20:37.666 --> 20:42.875
After all, no one gives a damn
what happens here.

20:44.041 --> 20:48.166
Just do me a favor, don't go
kicking any hornets' nests.

20:48.166 --> 20:51.416
No... why would I...

20:52.208 --> 20:53.708
No.

20:54.791 --> 20:55.916
The desk...

20:55.916 --> 20:57.208
...stays inside.

20:58.208 --> 21:00.750
Help me push it back?

21:02.666 --> 21:04.208
C'mon...

21:06.083 --> 21:07.291
Hey...

21:08.208 --> 21:11.416
So... What's up with the
computer lab?

21:23.875 --> 21:25.958
They were installed four years
ago,

21:25.958 --> 21:29.041
and two months later they were
stolen.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.583
- That was four years ago? -
Mhhm.

21:40.875 --> 21:43.166
There are no other computers
here?

21:43.166 --> 21:46.416
The only one that works is in my
office.

21:47.250 --> 21:52.125
Welcome to Escuela Primaria José
Urbina López, Mr. Juárez..

22:34.125 --> 22:37.041
THE MEGA YACHTS OF THE RICH AND
FAMOUS

22:50.750 --> 22:52.875
What was that?

22:58.375 --> 23:00.708
What's this?

23:00.916 --> 23:03.125
I found it on the dump.

23:03.375 --> 23:06.125
You should've left it there.

23:06.333 --> 23:09.416
What use do we have for such
fantasies?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.416
Come in, come in.

23:53.625 --> 23:57.208
Sit wherever you like, there are
no assigned seats here.

23:57.208 --> 24:00.125
In fact, you don't even need to
sit if you don't want to.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.416
Hurry, come in!

24:20.416 --> 24:23.083
We're going to do amazing things
in here every day.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.583
but if you come late, you'll
miss it.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.541
Have you heard the story of the
burro that fell into the well?

24:32.541 --> 24:34.208
No?

24:34.458 --> 24:36.750
Then let me tell you...

24:37.916 --> 24:42.291
One day, a burro fell into a
deep well.

24:42.291 --> 24:46.291
Miraculously, it wasn't hurt,
but it couldn't get out.

24:46.291 --> 24:48.583
The farmer who owned the donkey

24:48.583 --> 24:52.125
figured that rescuing it would
be very expensive,

24:52.125 --> 24:54.041
certainly more than the burro
was worth.

24:54.041 --> 24:58.416
And since the well was dry and a
danger to his other animals,

24:58.416 --> 25:01.083
he decided he should bury them
both:

25:01.083 --> 25:03.375
The burro and the well.

25:03.375 --> 25:06.000
So, he began to shovel dirt into
the well.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.250
The dirt fell on the burro, who
cried out,

25:09.250 --> 25:13.250
But the farmer kept on
shoveling.

25:13.541 --> 25:18.000
After a while, the burro fell
silent.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.500
The farmer assumed the animal
was dead,

25:20.500 --> 25:24.333
but he had to fill the well so
no one else would fall in.

25:24.333 --> 25:27.750
So, he kept shoveling.

25:29.250 --> 25:34.208
Imagine his surprise when he
suddenly saw

25:34.208 --> 25:38.708
the tips of two ears sticking
out of the well.

25:39.166 --> 25:40.916
He shoveled faster and faster,

25:40.916 --> 25:47.041
as the burro's head slowly
emerged, shaking off the dirt.

25:48.291 --> 25:50.208
Instead of letting itself get
buried,

25:50.208 --> 25:53.166
the burro used all the dirt that
was thrown on it to step up and

25:53.166 --> 25:55.041
up

25:55.041 --> 25:59.166
until the mound of dirt was high
enough

25:59.166 --> 26:02.916
that it could jump right out of
the well.

26:03.958 --> 26:08.291
From now, we are going to be
like that burro.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.166
No matter how much dirt gets
thrown at us, no matter how much

26:11.166 --> 26:13.083
shit rains down,

26:13.083 --> 26:15.916
we are not going to let it bury
us.

26:15.916 --> 26:19.125
We're going to shake it off, and
we're going to use it

26:19.125 --> 26:22.083
to become the very best students
in the world.

26:25.375 --> 26:28.000
There IS one thing that can stop
you though

26:28.000 --> 26:30.083
if you let it.

26:33.041 --> 26:34.750
It's you.

26:36.041 --> 26:40.000
Now, I understand why you might
not

26:40.000 --> 26:42.625
when there are kids your age in
the world

26:42.625 --> 26:46.958
who can solve formulas in
advanced calculus

26:46.958 --> 26:51.208
or write symphonies, or even
build robots.

26:51.208 --> 26:54.083
How could the students at José
Urbina ever do those kinds of

26:54.083 --> 26:55.791
things,

26:55.791 --> 27:00.041
if we don't have computers, the
Internet,

27:00.041 --> 27:03.166
Sometimes we don't even have
electricity.

27:05.041 --> 27:07.250
But, you know what?

27:07.250 --> 27:10.791
We don't need any of that. None
of it.

27:10.791 --> 27:14.583
What you need, what each of you
needs,

27:15.625 --> 27:17.208
you already have.

27:17.666 --> 27:19.416
And it's called...

27:19.416 --> 27:21.541
Potential.

27:21.625 --> 27:24.000
It's up to you whether you use
it or not.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.916
I can't make you.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.041
Neither can your parents.

27:28.041 --> 27:32.583
It's your responsibility to
decide if you want to use it,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.583
and how you want to use it.

27:35.791 --> 27:36.458
So let's do this:

27:36.458 --> 27:39.916
From now on, I'm not going to
decide what we learn;

27:39.916 --> 27:42.916
YOU will. All right?

27:42.916 --> 27:46.875
So now, tell me:

27:47.041 --> 27:48.875
What do you want to learn?

27:49.916 --> 27:52.833
It can be anything, anything at
all.

27:52.833 --> 27:55.041
What do you want to learn?

28:00.166 --> 28:01.750
Oh, nothing.

28:02.041 --> 28:03.916
No one? Nothing?

28:04.000 --> 28:04.958
Perfect.

28:04.958 --> 28:07.291
Easy for me, then.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.416
We'll just sit here then...

28:11.750 --> 28:13.750
...and learn about nothing.

28:15.750 --> 28:19.291
And if you want to, we can do
this all year.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.708
What was that?

28:30.916 --> 28:32.250
Who was it?

28:33.000 --> 28:33.500
No one?

28:33.500 --> 28:37.791
On the count of three, I want
everyone to raise their pen.

28:37.791 --> 28:40.583
One, two, three!

28:44.583 --> 28:45.333
Come here.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.916
Yes, you in the back.

28:47.916 --> 28:50.291
Yes, you. Come.

28:56.375 --> 28:59.250
- What's your name? - Nico.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.125
I also used to be the class
clown, Nico.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.208
I was always punished.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.875
I'll give you a piece of advice:

29:07.041 --> 29:09.041
Don't ever change.

29:26.041 --> 29:26.541
Yes?

29:26.541 --> 29:29.208
No need to raise your hand.
What's your name?

29:29.208 --> 29:31.166
- Donovan. - Yes, Donovan?

29:31.166 --> 29:35.750
I'd like to keep learning about
boats and ships.

29:36.875 --> 29:42.291
Good, anyone think more about
our boats from yesterday?

29:43.541 --> 29:48.708
I realized that sometimes people
are going to die

29:48.708 --> 29:51.000
and there's nothing we can do
about it.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.041
And that's life.

29:52.041 --> 29:56.208
Whoa, heavy. "There's nothing we
can do."

29:56.208 --> 30:00.208
So, we should just let them die?

30:00.208 --> 30:01.166
- Yes? - My name is Lupe.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.666
You don't have to raise your
hand.

30:03.666 --> 30:06.666
I don't agree that there's
nothing we can do about it.

30:06.666 --> 30:10.000
I think you need to do as much
as you can.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.125
You need to do as much as you
can for as many as you can.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.958
Very good, very good.

30:17.958 --> 30:20.166
You just said the same thing

30:20.166 --> 30:23.500
as one of the world's greatest
philosophers.

30:23.500 --> 30:27.166
His name is John Stuart Mill.

30:27.166 --> 30:29.166
Maybe you could be a
philosopher.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.958
What's a "philosopher"?

30:30.958 --> 30:34.875
It's someone who studies
philosophy.

30:35.041 --> 30:38.083
Which is a way to explore,

30:38.083 --> 30:43.208
or talk about life's deepest,
most complicated questions,

30:43.208 --> 30:44.625
which can be very hard to
understand.

30:44.625 --> 30:48.000
and that helps us figure out
right from wrong.

30:48.000 --> 30:51.125
But I still want to know why a
boat floats.

30:51.125 --> 30:51.208
But I still want to know why a
boat floats.
Oh, right.

30:51.208 --> 30:52.083
Oh, right.

30:52.083 --> 30:55.541
Have you thought about why the
boat would sink if the director

30:55.541 --> 30:57.958
got on?

30:57.958 --> 31:00.166
'Cause he's a fat ass.

31:00.166 --> 31:01.166
Good job!

31:01.166 --> 31:03.958
You didn't raise your hand, well
done!

31:03.958 --> 31:05.708
Very good, thanks.

31:05.708 --> 31:09.416
Tell me, Nico, why would the
boat sink because he's fat?

31:10.541 --> 31:13.666
Maybe because he's too heavy?

31:13.666 --> 31:17.041
Did you know a fat person floats
in water better

31:17.041 --> 31:20.875
than a muscular person that
weighs the same?

31:21.208 --> 31:21.833
No?

31:21.833 --> 31:24.875
Can anyone tell me why that
might happen?

31:25.000 --> 31:25.833
Why?

31:25.833 --> 31:28.875
It's a tough one, but I know you
can do it.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.250
Think about it. Think, think,
think.

31:31.250 --> 31:35.000
Who wants to take a guess? Or,
how about this?

31:35.000 --> 31:38.041
Why if I blow up a balloon,

31:38.041 --> 31:41.125
it falls through the air, but
floats on water?

31:43.125 --> 31:46.166
Remember a fat person floats
better

31:46.166 --> 31:50.041
than a muscular person who
weighs the same.

31:50.083 --> 31:51.166
Why?

31:51.166 --> 31:52.875
Because they have different
sizes?

31:52.875 --> 31:56.125
Ah, so then it's the size.
Maybe.

31:56.125 --> 31:59.500
What if I take a bowling ball
that is the same size as my

31:59.500 --> 32:01.416
balloon,

32:01.416 --> 32:03.916
and drop them both on water?

32:03.916 --> 32:05.958
The bowling ball would sink,
it's heavier.

32:05.958 --> 32:09.208
- And the balloon would float. -
But, how?

32:09.208 --> 32:11.208
If they're the same size?

32:11.208 --> 32:14.041
So, is it the size, or the
weight?

32:14.041 --> 32:16.416
I'll give you a clue.

32:16.625 --> 32:20.416
It has to do with the way
fractions work.

32:22.458 --> 32:24.666
That's precisely what we were
going to talk about today.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.875
Fractions, division, and
remainders.

32:27.875 --> 32:29.708
Alright let's see...

32:29.708 --> 32:31.875
Remember the boat game?

32:31.875 --> 32:35.250
Tell me, what were the
remainders.

32:36.916 --> 32:37.958
Think about it.

32:37.958 --> 32:41.083
The passengers who didn't fit in
the boat?

32:41.083 --> 32:42.041
Exactly!

32:42.041 --> 32:45.416
The passengers who couldn't fit
in the boat and drowned.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.041
Well done!

32:47.041 --> 32:48.416
Wow.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.541
You're so smart that, honestly,
I don't think that you even need

32:53.541 --> 32:55.750
me here.

32:55.750 --> 32:59.208
So... I'm going to go get a
drink...

32:59.291 --> 33:01.000
...and be back in 30 minutes.

33:01.000 --> 33:06.208
I bet by the time I get back
you'll have all the answers.

33:06.916 --> 33:09.083
Anyone want anything? No?

33:09.083 --> 33:10.750
I'll be right back.

33:29.208 --> 33:32.750
- Muscle is heavier than fat. -
How do you know that?

33:32.750 --> 33:34.416
My mom works at a butcher shop.

33:34.416 --> 33:37.500
A kilo of meat looks like this,
and a kilo of fat like this.

33:37.500 --> 33:40.541
Maybe there's air in the fat and
that's why it floats.

33:40.541 --> 33:43.750
So if they weigh the same, the
fat guy should be bigger.

33:43.750 --> 33:44.958
But what does it have to do with
size,

33:44.958 --> 33:48.291
if a big balloon floats on
water, but a pebble will sink.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.166
- Because it has air in it. -
Yes,

33:50.166 --> 33:53.750
but I I'm sure a giant balloon
would weigh more than a pebble.

33:53.750 --> 33:56.125
So that's it then, a fat person
floats better because they have

33:56.125 --> 33:58.416
more air inside.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.166
Like Director Chucho.

34:13.541 --> 34:14.875
You must be the new guy.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.000
I'm Arturo... Mr. García.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.583
Hello, I'm Sergio.

34:19.583 --> 34:21.791
Is everything okay, Sergio?

34:21.791 --> 34:24.125
Uh, yeah, I think so.

34:24.583 --> 34:28.208
The kids are getting the best of
you.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.875
That's one way to put it.

34:30.875 --> 34:34.083
You can't let them see your
weaknesses.

34:34.083 --> 34:37.833
The key is to discipline them
from the beginning.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.875
They have to know who has the
authority.

34:42.416 --> 34:46.708
Hmm, I think maybe it should be
exactly the opposite.

34:49.416 --> 34:51.875
Well, good luck with that.

34:52.208 --> 34:53.583
Thanks.

34:57.583 --> 35:01.750
You know the most powerful words
a teacher can say?

35:02.625 --> 35:04.208
I don't know.

35:04.208 --> 35:06.916
Ah, you do!

35:09.041 --> 35:12.083
Shouldn't you be teaching right
now?

35:12.083 --> 35:14.125
Better I let them learn.

35:22.208 --> 35:24.291
Mr. Juárez, everything all
right?

35:24.291 --> 35:26.041
Sergio, just call me Sergio.

35:26.041 --> 35:30.083
Shouldn't you be in your class
right now, MR. JUÁREZ?

35:30.083 --> 35:32.125
Yeah, yeah. So?

35:32.125 --> 35:33.500
The kids are good.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.666
Don't worry, in fact they may be
too good.

35:36.666 --> 35:39.666
- This is the school's only
computer? - Yes.

35:39.666 --> 35:42.083
- May I use it for a minute? -
What? Now?

35:42.083 --> 35:46.291
Yeah, it's just that these kids
are incredible.

35:46.291 --> 35:49.291
I can barely keep up with them.

35:49.291 --> 35:51.708
I would've thought that a former
middle school teacher

35:51.708 --> 35:54.916
would be qualified to teach
sixth graders.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.333
Yeah... me, too.

35:57.333 --> 36:01.416
It's just that they're... moving
so fast.

36:01.416 --> 36:05.750
Do you mind if I just...? Come
on, only for a sec -

36:05.750 --> 36:08.125
Enough, Mr. Juárez! Let's go
let's go.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.083
Enough, Mr. Juárez! Let's go
let's go.

36:09.083 --> 36:10.208
Three minutes. Out.

36:10.208 --> 36:14.041
I'm sorry, Director. Daniel
won't stop crying.

36:14.625 --> 36:18.208
What's wrong, little one? Do you
like clowns?

36:18.958 --> 36:22.208
Look! A clown's nose.

36:54.375 --> 36:57.166
What are you laughing at? What's
your name?

36:57.166 --> 36:59.583
Hey, come back! Wait!

37:15.791 --> 37:17.166
So, what did we learn?

37:17.166 --> 37:19.125
Have we figured out the problem?

37:19.125 --> 37:22.000
FLOTATION = WEIGHT / SIZE

37:25.750 --> 37:31.041
We think that if a fat man and a
muscular guy weigh the same,

37:31.041 --> 37:34.416
then the fat man would be
bigger,

37:34.416 --> 37:37.000
because muscle is heavier than
fat.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.125
Exactly! Well done!

37:40.625 --> 37:42.125
What? What's wrong?

37:42.125 --> 37:47.291
We were sure that if two things
are the same size,

37:47.291 --> 37:50.625
then the lighter would float
better.

37:50.625 --> 37:53.208
Ha! You're both right!

37:54.208 --> 37:55.750
How can that be?

37:55.750 --> 37:59.500
It's called an inversely
proportional relationship,

37:59.500 --> 38:02.500
and you figured out both parts
of it.

38:02.583 --> 38:05.333
What we were calling
'flotation',

38:05.333 --> 38:08.333
is the concept of density.

38:08.333 --> 38:12.250
Where density equals mass over
volume.

38:12.250 --> 38:15.375
Mass is another word for weight,

38:15.375 --> 38:16.250
and volume is another word for
size.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.083
and volume is another word for
size.

38:18.083 --> 38:22.208
As the mass increases, we get
higher density,

38:22.208 --> 38:26.041
but if volume increases, we get
lower density.

38:26.458 --> 38:28.125
Got it?

38:31.708 --> 38:34.125
In Spanish, please!

39:01.125 --> 39:04.458
- Mr. Director, won't you join
us? - What are you doing?!

39:04.458 --> 39:07.750
- Isn't it cool? - I mean, why
are you out here?

39:08.208 --> 39:10.583
It was your idea, remember?

39:10.583 --> 39:13.208
Turn the playground into a
classroom.

39:13.208 --> 39:16.000
You're supposed to be teaching
natural science,

39:16.000 --> 39:17.333
Your lesson plan today, if I am
not mistaken, should be on the

39:17.333 --> 39:19.291
Solar System.

39:19.291 --> 39:21.541
That was the plan, but right now
they're more interested in

39:21.541 --> 39:23.916
physics.

39:24.541 --> 39:25.875
- Physics? - Yeah.

39:25.875 --> 39:27.708
As far as I know, there's
nothing about physics on the

39:27.708 --> 39:30.166
ENLACE test.

39:30.541 --> 39:32.750
The ENLACE, sir. Come on.

39:32.750 --> 39:36.875
Teaching to that test isn't
going to help these kids.

39:38.208 --> 39:40.791
What does it really even
measure?

39:40.791 --> 39:42.208
Teachers.

39:42.208 --> 39:45.208
Did you ever think of that?

39:48.000 --> 39:50.041
Come here.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.916
What have you learned about
physics today?

39:52.916 --> 39:54.958
Um... not much.

39:54.958 --> 39:58.000
I mean I understand the 'reverse
relationship' of density -

39:58.000 --> 40:01.041
- Inversely proportional. -
Yeah, that.

40:01.041 --> 40:04.583
Inversely proportional...
between mass and volume

40:04.583 --> 40:07.041
and how that changes density...

40:07.041 --> 40:11.625
But how those huge metal ships
are able to float...

40:11.625 --> 40:12.833
I just don't know.

40:12.833 --> 40:14.625
But neither did you.

40:14.625 --> 40:18.416
Well, uhm, that's a tough one.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.833
- It's difficult. - I see...

40:19.833 --> 40:22.625
So, who is more dense, then?

40:22.625 --> 40:25.208
You, or the Director?

40:26.000 --> 40:28.541
Uh, I'm sure that...

40:28.541 --> 40:32.750
the Director is far, far less
dense than I am.

40:32.958 --> 40:34.500
You like to push it, huh?

40:34.500 --> 40:35.833
No, not at all.

40:35.833 --> 40:41.416
Although he has a lot more mass
and much more volume,

40:41.541 --> 40:44.250
To know who is more or less
dense, we would have to measure

40:44.250 --> 40:46.583
ourselves.

40:46.875 --> 40:48.541
How could we do that?

40:48.541 --> 40:51.125
If mass is weight, couldn't we
just weigh you?

40:51.125 --> 40:55.041
Yes, we could. But what about
volume?

40:55.041 --> 40:55.166
Yes, we could. But what about
volume?
Long by wide by high.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.916
Long by wide by high.

40:56.916 --> 41:00.041
Length by width by height, but
very good.

41:00.041 --> 41:04.208
That works for a regular object,
like a cube.

41:04.208 --> 41:07.041
What about an irregular object,
like a person?

41:07.041 --> 41:11.166
What's the Director's width? Is
it this...

41:11.166 --> 41:12.750
or this?

41:14.666 --> 41:17.625
Think about it. You're soooo
close.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.375
C'mon you've got this.

41:19.375 --> 41:22.750
You have the answer right in
front of you!

41:31.125 --> 41:34.166
Oh, Paloma. One second.

41:35.291 --> 41:38.541
I saw your notebook. You know
all the answers,

41:38.541 --> 41:41.708
Why didn't you share them with
your classmates?

41:43.500 --> 41:46.291
Look, you have real ability and
-

41:46.291 --> 41:48.708
Aerospace engineer?

41:49.333 --> 41:50.041
Pardon?

41:50.041 --> 41:53.625
You told Lupe she could be a
philosopher.

41:53.625 --> 41:57.416
Do you think I could be an
aerospace engineer?

41:59.125 --> 42:01.291
You want to design spaceships?

42:01.291 --> 42:06.916
Well, several astronauts were
first aerospace engineers.

42:08.958 --> 42:10.500
Whoa...

42:10.500 --> 42:11.916
Astronaut.

42:13.083 --> 42:14.250
Okay.

42:14.916 --> 42:18.250
I guess we have our work cut out
for us.

42:19.083 --> 42:20.166
Paloma...

42:20.166 --> 42:21.333
If you could try to share a
little bit more with your

42:21.333 --> 42:23.666
classmates,

42:23.666 --> 42:26.708
there's a lot we could learn
from you.

42:27.458 --> 42:29.583
Do you think you can try?

42:36.166 --> 42:39.041
Why are we going the wrong way?

42:47.000 --> 42:49.541
Can I help you? Um...

42:49.541 --> 42:52.083
Do you have any books about
philosophy?

42:52.083 --> 42:53.750
Philosophy?

42:54.166 --> 42:56.750
Or philosophers?

42:56.750 --> 42:58.541
Philosophers?

42:59.416 --> 43:02.125
Maybe John Stuart Mill?

43:02.125 --> 43:02.916
Who?

43:02.916 --> 43:03.333
John Stuart -

43:03.333 --> 43:05.875
Those are college subjects,

43:05.875 --> 43:08.416
I don't know why you'd have any
need to read stuff like that at

43:08.416 --> 43:10.875
your age?

43:12.041 --> 43:14.125
Okay, well, thanks.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.416
Is that what you wanted?

43:20.791 --> 43:22.750
Watcha got there?

43:23.000 --> 43:26.208
Did you know you can burn things
with that using sunlight?

43:26.208 --> 43:29.708
- I did. - Yeah, who doesn't,
right?

43:29.708 --> 43:33.083
What a couple! The nerd and the
hoodlum.

43:38.875 --> 43:41.041
Go to hell.

43:42.041 --> 43:46.458
- Afternoon, Director. - Good
afternoon, Mr. García.

43:46.458 --> 43:49.000
This new guy, Mr. Juárez...

43:49.000 --> 43:51.166
- What do you know about him? -
Well...

43:51.166 --> 43:56.083
I checked his evaluations, his
references, the usual.

43:56.083 --> 43:58.875
- Is that all? - Yeah.

43:59.083 --> 44:01.041
That's interesting,

44:01.041 --> 44:02.416
because...

44:03.041 --> 44:05.916
I made a few calls...

44:18.083 --> 44:20.833
Where were you? I was worried.

44:20.833 --> 44:24.166
I guess I've been moving slower
today.

44:31.041 --> 44:32.500
What was that for?

44:32.500 --> 44:35.875
I don't know. I had a good day.

44:37.166 --> 44:38.875
Come on.

44:42.125 --> 44:44.208
It floats!

44:47.125 --> 44:49.291
Ok, you won.

44:49.500 --> 44:53.208
But why do you think it floats?

45:42.583 --> 45:45.833
Mr. Juárez, I hope you don't
mind.

45:45.833 --> 45:48.291
Not at all, come in.

45:48.291 --> 45:50.416
Please, come in.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.875
- How are you? This way. - I'm
fine.

45:56.208 --> 45:58.208
Look, before this goes any
further,

45:58.208 --> 46:01.166
I need to know exactly what
you're up to.

46:01.166 --> 46:04.875
So, I guess it isn't true that
"no one gives a damn.”

46:04.875 --> 46:07.875
It's my responsibility to look
out for my kids.

46:08.166 --> 46:10.125
"My kids..."

46:10.625 --> 46:12.041
Listen.

46:12.041 --> 46:14.291
I called your old school.

46:14.291 --> 46:18.166
They told me about an "incident"
you had there.

46:18.166 --> 46:21.708
I had an episode in front of the
students.

46:21.708 --> 46:26.041
A kind of existential crisis,
let's say.

46:26.041 --> 46:27.666
I'm fine.

46:27.666 --> 46:29.458
What else do you want to know?

46:29.458 --> 46:30.541
Nothing, nothing.

46:30.541 --> 46:32.041
I'm only trying to understand
what it is you're trying to do

46:32.041 --> 46:34.083
here.

46:34.083 --> 46:36.083
I mean, what's your method?

46:36.083 --> 46:38.083
No, no...

46:38.875 --> 46:41.583
I don't have a method exactly.

46:41.875 --> 46:42.666
I don't understand.

46:42.666 --> 46:44.583
Hey, can I offer you a beer?

46:44.583 --> 46:48.750
- No, I was just - - Please, I'm
inviting you in to my home.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.041
Honey? We have a guest.

46:52.208 --> 46:53.375
- Good afternoon. - Hello.

46:53.375 --> 46:55.833
This is my wife, Laura. He's my
boss.

46:55.833 --> 46:59.208
Oh, I thought I was the boss.

46:59.958 --> 47:01.708
Nice to meet you.

47:01.708 --> 47:03.125
I'm Chucho.

47:03.125 --> 47:05.708
And this is our little surprise.

47:06.708 --> 47:08.875
He can be a bit impertinent.

47:08.875 --> 47:10.458
Yeah, I've noticed.

47:10.458 --> 47:14.083
I'm going to put the baby down.
Make yourself at home.

47:14.083 --> 47:16.708
Thank you. Excuse me.

47:19.875 --> 47:23.583
You asked why I came here.

47:24.958 --> 47:26.583
"José Urbina López Elementary
School

47:26.583 --> 47:30.125
receives... grant for a computer
lab."

47:30.541 --> 47:33.166
That's dated eight months ago.

47:33.166 --> 47:35.291
It says the funds were already
disbursed.

47:35.291 --> 47:39.750
They were disbursed all right,
but they never got to us.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.875
- You know how it goes. - Yeah.

47:42.875 --> 47:46.291
"They'll be there tomorrow, no
need to press."

47:46.500 --> 47:48.333
In Matamoros you don't press
more if you know what's good for

47:48.333 --> 47:50.291
you.

47:50.291 --> 47:53.250
Of course, yeah, sure.

47:55.333 --> 47:57.375
Why the obsession?

47:57.375 --> 48:01.583
We grew up without computer labs
and we turned out fine.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.208
You have one of those phones
that go online?

48:06.208 --> 48:07.333
Yeah, why?

48:07.333 --> 48:10.250
Can I borrow it? I want to show
you something.

48:15.750 --> 48:17.125
By the way,

48:17.125 --> 48:20.500
there's a girl in my class,
Paloma Noyola.

48:20.500 --> 48:23.750
- What do you know about her? -
Not much. Quiet...

48:23.750 --> 48:26.125
Could apply herself more.

48:26.583 --> 48:29.708
- That's it? - Yeah, why?

48:45.500 --> 48:48.083
- This is the last of it. -
Let's see...

48:48.083 --> 48:50.958
18 kilos of iron at 55 cents per
kilo,

48:50.958 --> 48:53.000
3 kilos of aluminum, at 11 pesos
per kilo,

48:53.000 --> 48:54.875
4 kilos of bronze at 2.75,

48:54.875 --> 48:57.416
and 3 kilos of copper at 26
pesos.

48:57.416 --> 49:00.125
The total comes to 105 pesos.

49:06.958 --> 49:07.666
Let's go.

49:07.666 --> 49:09.208
He shorted you.

49:09.583 --> 49:10.666
What's that?

49:10.666 --> 49:12.708
Papa, he's cheating you.

49:14.041 --> 49:18.166
Excuse me? I think you counted
wrong.

49:18.250 --> 49:22.083
It should be 131.9 pesos.

49:22.208 --> 49:24.708
Rounded up, 132 pesos.

49:24.708 --> 49:28.250
Would you check again? Of
course...

49:31.416 --> 49:36.958
Look at that... you're right.
It's 131.90 pesos.

49:37.041 --> 49:39.916
Sorry. Must've hit the wrong
key.

49:54.958 --> 49:56.166
Nico!

49:56.625 --> 49:57.291
What happened?!

49:57.291 --> 50:00.125
You didn't come to Nacho's.

50:00.125 --> 50:01.666
I'm sorry, I just -

50:01.666 --> 50:03.083
Where's your backpack?

50:03.083 --> 50:04.250
It's inside.

50:04.250 --> 50:06.708
You need to think, Nico!

50:29.958 --> 50:31.583
It's okay.

50:34.125 --> 50:37.250
I'll be fine. You sure?

50:40.541 --> 50:42.416
What are you doing?

50:44.083 --> 50:50.208
Ever since I can remember, this
thing has been here, rotting

50:51.125 --> 50:54.375
Think you can fix it?

50:54.375 --> 50:55.833
Maybe.

50:55.833 --> 50:59.208
I've been learning about
flotation at school.

50:59.208 --> 51:01.625
Flotation? Really?

51:01.625 --> 51:04.708
- How will you get it to float?
- Well...

51:04.708 --> 51:07.833
First, I have to keep the water
out of it.

51:07.833 --> 51:12.166
- Duh, obviously! - No, what I
meant is...

51:12.166 --> 51:12.208
- Duh, obviously! - No, what I
meant is...
I need to seal all the holes
because if water gets in...

51:12.208 --> 51:17.166
I need to seal all the holes
because if water gets in...

51:19.041 --> 51:20.541
What?

51:21.125 --> 51:23.041
Maybe... maybe that's it.

51:23.041 --> 51:26.125
Even though it's not sealed like
a balloon,

51:26.125 --> 51:29.291
it uses the air in this space,
somehow,

51:29.291 --> 51:32.250
so that it makes the boat less
dense than the water!

51:32.250 --> 51:34.583
Yeah! That could be it!

51:35.000 --> 51:36.166
Look at you...

51:36.166 --> 51:38.583
Getting all scientific!

51:44.583 --> 51:46.500
What is it?

51:46.583 --> 51:50.250
Do you think I could stay in
school, at least for a little

51:50.250 --> 51:52.583
longer?

51:53.250 --> 51:55.083
Jeez, I don't know, man.

51:55.083 --> 51:58.708
- Let me talk to Nacho, okay? -
All right.

52:33.916 --> 52:37.250
You're trying to tell me your
entire approach is based on

52:37.250 --> 52:39.875
some... YouTube video?

52:40.916 --> 52:43.125
Yeah, pretty much.

52:43.125 --> 52:46.708
So you said to hell with the
curriculum?

52:47.125 --> 52:49.416
Yeah, pretty much.

52:52.916 --> 52:55.916
We'll get it all covered
eventually, but,

52:55.916 --> 52:59.750
When they want to, when it's
their idea.

53:00.541 --> 53:02.958
Although, after what I saw
today,

53:02.958 --> 53:05.416
I'm not even sure they need me.

53:07.708 --> 53:10.000
If they had computers,

53:10.000 --> 53:12.750
they'd learn everything by
themselves.

53:12.750 --> 53:14.208
Oh my god.

53:18.875 --> 53:20.583
Here.

53:21.125 --> 53:24.041
Did you ever teach?

53:24.041 --> 53:26.500
It's a requirement to become a
Director.

53:26.500 --> 53:30.875
So then you remember why you
decided to become a teacher, no?

53:31.291 --> 53:33.208
That was a long time ago.

53:34.083 --> 53:37.208
What was the name of that
teacher?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.125
Mrs. Carmona.

53:45.166 --> 53:47.750
Mine was Mr. Chávez.

53:48.125 --> 53:51.208
Profe Juan Antonio Chávez.

53:52.375 --> 53:55.166
He told me I could change the
world,

53:55.166 --> 53:57.083
and I believed him.

53:58.166 --> 54:00.750
I remember how I gave him a hug
up there, in front of everyone,

54:00.750 --> 54:02.666
at my graduation.

54:02.666 --> 54:06.541
When I started teaching my kids
would come up to hug me, too.

54:07.041 --> 54:12.041
but over time, each year there
were fewer and fewer,

54:13.041 --> 54:17.208
until last year, not one.

54:18.791 --> 54:21.041
Kids have changed

54:21.041 --> 54:22.875
No.

54:23.333 --> 54:26.416
Kids will always be kids.

54:33.000 --> 54:35.208
The world has changed, Mr.
Juárez.

54:35.208 --> 54:37.958
Yes, but we haven't.

54:37.958 --> 54:41.083
Nothing in education has changed
in the last 100 years.

54:41.083 --> 54:44.958
Nothing. From the school bell to
the uniforms.

54:44.958 --> 54:48.916
"Be quiet! Stand in line! Raise
your hand!"

54:48.916 --> 54:52.416
We're training these kids to be
cogs in a machine

54:52.416 --> 54:56.583
whose only purpose is to keep
running for its own sake.

54:57.666 --> 55:00.125
And if it chews them up and
spits them out,

55:00.125 --> 55:04.125
it's because they didn't follow
the rules of our little game.

55:04.125 --> 55:07.750
But these kids are so much
smarter than that.

55:07.750 --> 55:12.291
They know full well the machine
is obsolete.

55:12.916 --> 55:17.416
So they tune out, they drift
away...

55:18.291 --> 55:20.583
...and we lose them.

55:21.500 --> 55:25.291
You asked me why I came here.

55:28.125 --> 55:31.166
I don't want to lose any more
kids.

55:32.500 --> 55:34.708
Not one more.

55:35.291 --> 55:38.666
Aren't you a little old to be
such an idealist?

55:38.666 --> 55:42.083
I'm a little too old to be a new
Dad again.

55:49.416 --> 55:53.750
- Okay, Mr. Juárez... - Sergio,
just Sergio.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.208
Call me Sergio.

55:56.541 --> 55:58.750
Okay, Sergio.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.166
I'm going to give you a
chance...

56:02.166 --> 56:04.750
...just don't piss it away, eh?

56:08.125 --> 56:10.458
Oh, actually...

56:10.458 --> 56:13.416
Can I ask you for one more tiny
favor?

56:15.333 --> 56:17.708
It's ready, get in.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.208
Mom, time to get up.

56:28.083 --> 56:32.416
What's going on? Come on, help
me out here.

56:35.375 --> 56:36.375
Good evening.

56:36.375 --> 56:39.125
Breakfast is on the table,
coffee's ready.

56:39.125 --> 56:40.500
Thank you.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.583
All right, in you go.

56:41.583 --> 56:47.083
No! What are you doing!? You
didn't take off your underwear.

56:50.041 --> 56:51.125
Hey...

56:51.125 --> 56:53.166
Get out, get out!

56:57.833 --> 57:00.250
Uhh, get back in...

57:09.416 --> 57:11.083
How much?

57:11.083 --> 57:14.125
- Seven centimeters. - Yeah!

57:14.583 --> 57:16.333
Next. Next!

57:16.333 --> 57:18.416
Wait, I changed my mind!

57:21.375 --> 57:24.125
Ok, I'm here.

57:26.166 --> 57:28.458
"Tiny favor."

57:29.250 --> 57:32.750
- It's for the kids, remember? -
For the kids.

57:32.750 --> 57:35.916
For the kids... This is for the
kids!

57:35.916 --> 57:37.875
For the kids!

57:37.958 --> 57:39.875
For the kids!

57:44.041 --> 57:46.208
I'm going, I'm going.

57:54.666 --> 57:56.875
- Ten Centimeters. - Ten
centimeters!

58:03.041 --> 58:03.541
Sergio is more dense!

58:03.541 --> 58:04.750
Sergio is more dense!

58:29.916 --> 58:34.750
We can build a water heater, or
an oven...

58:34.750 --> 58:38.041
I have an idea! Check this out.

58:38.041 --> 58:41.125
- We're going to win! - Hell,
yeah!

59:02.541 --> 59:05.500
Hi, there. Can I help you?

59:05.500 --> 59:08.583
Do you have any books about
philosophy?

59:08.583 --> 59:09.416
Of course.

59:09.416 --> 59:12.208
Are you interested in any area
in particular?

59:13.791 --> 59:17.000
Metaphysics? Ontology?
Epistemology?

59:17.000 --> 59:21.208
Morality? Logic? Aesthetics?

59:23.208 --> 59:25.125
Marlene, can you give me a hand?

59:30.958 --> 59:32.583
Here you go.

59:46.416 --> 59:49.250
- This never happens! - Give it
a whack.

59:53.666 --> 59:54.583
Sorry.

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:01.958
Over here.

01:00:01.958 --> 01:00:04.916
None of that is usable. Take all
you want.

01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:08.750
Careful not to cut yourself.
Good luck.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:15.916
We believe gravity is that which
makes us fall,

01:00:15.916 --> 01:00:17.708
but it only seems like we're
falling.

01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:21.416
When we're actually being pulled
towards Earth,

01:00:21.416 --> 01:00:24.750
because its mass is so enormous
compared to ours.

01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:27.416
It's the same reason why the sun
pulls the Earth.

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:29.875
Then, if the sun is pulling the
Earth how come we don't just

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:31.666
crash into the sun?

01:00:31.666 --> 01:00:35.625
Because the orbit is the exact
spot where a planet is caught

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:37.041
between falling towards
something and falling away from

01:00:37.041 --> 01:00:39.125
it.

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:42.375
So, the entire universe, all of
us, all the time,

01:00:42.375 --> 01:00:45.750
are actually just falling
through space?

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:49.125
- Yeah, something like that. -
Cool!

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.250
- Hey watch where you point
that. - Sorry!

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:00.708
Okay, so...

01:01:00.708 --> 01:01:04.166
Everyone knows that a magnifying
glass can burn things.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:10.916
This is unfocused light
reflected onto my hand.

01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:13.875
But what happens if we focus it?

01:01:25.166 --> 01:01:25.625
Tada!

01:01:25.625 --> 01:01:28.416
I hope you enjoyed our Solar
Death Ray!

01:01:28.416 --> 01:01:32.125
If you think that was cool,
You'll like this even more...

01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:35.208
Watch what it does to this
bottle of gasoline!

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:45.208
Rotation!

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:48.875
Come on, everyone! Let me see
you rotating!

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:08.791
Rotation!

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.208
Now revolution!

01:02:26.833 --> 01:02:31.416
JOSÉ URBINA ELEMENTARY RECEIVES
GRANT FOR COMPUTER LAB

01:02:54.833 --> 01:02:57.041
Why so early, Nico?

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.208
Everything ok?

01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:03.291
All right, tell me.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:08.416
You said we could ask you
anything, right?

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.083
Yup.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:12.250
And there is no question that's
too weird or that we shouldn't

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.208
ask, right?

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:15.208
That's right.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:19.791
Okay, so... here's my question.

01:03:19.791 --> 01:03:21.250
Shoot.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:28.416
How do I get a girl to like me?

01:03:29.041 --> 01:03:31.000
- See! - No, no!

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.583
It's a very good question.

01:03:33.583 --> 01:03:36.750
A very important question, in
fact.

01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:39.125
I'm serious, but...

01:03:39.291 --> 01:03:43.500
like all big questions, there's
no one answer.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.791
Dammit.

01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:48.541
Because there's not only one
kind of girl.

01:03:50.125 --> 01:03:53.041
What kind of girl are we talking
about?

01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:55.166
That's the thing.

01:03:55.166 --> 01:03:58.500
She's just so smart, and I'm so
dumb -

01:03:58.500 --> 01:03:59.875
Hey, hey.

01:04:00.833 --> 01:04:02.125
None of that.

01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:03.916
Every time I try to impress her,
I end up saying something

01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:05.833
stupid.

01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:08.041
Well there's your problem!

01:04:08.041 --> 01:04:08.541
What?

01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:13.375
You're trying to impress her,
show her how great you are.

01:04:13.375 --> 01:04:15.083
That works with some women,
but...

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:18.416
You're not interested in just
any girl, are you?

01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:19.541
There you go.

01:04:19.541 --> 01:04:20.791
With a girl like that,

01:04:20.791 --> 01:04:25.291
you gotta show her how great she
is, not you.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:28.708
Support her, encourage her...

01:04:29.333 --> 01:04:31.708
Because she is going places.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.041
Especially someone like Paloma.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.083
- How...? - Eh, it was pretty
obvious.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.250
Look.

01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:47.416
I was going to give this to her,

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:51.125
but I think maybe you should.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:58.416
Tell her "look what I found and
it made me think of you."

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:03.583
How come you know all this
stuff?

01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:08.750
Remember when I said we learn
from our mistakes?

01:05:09.958 --> 01:05:12.875
I've made a lot of them.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.541
Take care of it now, you don't
want to lose it -

01:05:18.541 --> 01:05:19.416
No!

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:25.875
Sorry, it's just that... I keep
important stuff in here.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.375
Let me see that bag, Nico.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:35.791
It just has my school supplies,
a gift from my brother...

01:05:35.791 --> 01:05:37.750
- That's all. - Nico!

01:05:40.416 --> 01:05:43.083
- No, no, no, - Nico, give it -

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:46.208
Please, we never open it.
Please!

01:05:48.041 --> 01:05:50.458
Give me that bag.

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:53.541
If they find out, they'll kill
me.

01:05:54.041 --> 01:05:57.875
Please, I'm begging you. Don't
open it.

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:01.250
Give it to me, Nico.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:04.708
Will you?

01:06:32.875 --> 01:06:34.083
What?

01:06:36.916 --> 01:06:38.875
If I open this bag,

01:06:39.083 --> 01:06:43.708
am I going to find something no
12-year-old should have,

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:46.041
much less bring to school?

01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:48.208
I don't know.

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:50.416
Maybe.

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:54.250
Nico, if I find something like
that,

01:06:54.541 --> 01:06:58.166
I'll have no choice but to
report it,

01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:59.916
and from then on everything will
get much more complicated for

01:06:59.916 --> 01:07:02.208
you

01:07:03.208 --> 01:07:06.541
So what are you going to do?

01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:09.208
That's what you have to tell me.

01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:17.875
Good morning.

01:07:18.125 --> 01:07:19.625
I looked up your questions,

01:07:19.625 --> 01:07:22.875
they're up front with your names
on them.

01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:29.916
Nico, I know you've had a lot of
catching up to do,

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:34.583
but out of all my students,
you've made the most progress.

01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:38.166
Remember what I said at the top
of the year about taking charge

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:40.750
of your lives?

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.708
You have to decide which
direction you want your life to

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:44.750
go.

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:47.750
Do you want it to go this way?

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.083
or this way.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.208
You can't have both.

01:07:59.750 --> 01:08:01.333
Almost on time.

01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.541
At least you're making progress.

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:07.458
Today, we're having Rosita's
dance presentation.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.500
It's going to be fantastic.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:14.416
But before we begin, it's game
time.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.082
Pay attention.

01:08:17.082 --> 01:08:19.791
There was a famous mathematician
named

01:08:19.791 --> 01:08:23.041
Carl Friedrich Gauss.

01:08:23.041 --> 01:08:25.916
In 1777, when he was a kid,

01:08:25.916 --> 01:08:28.000
his teacher wanted to keep all
his students busy,

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.082
so he asked them to add up all
the numbers from 1 to 100.

01:08:34.875 --> 01:08:38.166
This was supposed to take them
hours,

01:08:38.166 --> 01:08:42.082
but Gauss answered immediately.

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:45.541
Can anyone tell me how he did
it?

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.250
Uh, Team 2? Paloma?

01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.375
Is it...

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.750
5050?

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:08.291
How did you get that?

01:09:09.207 --> 01:09:14.457
I added 100 plus 1... 101.

01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:17.707
99 plus 2, 101.

01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:20.166
98 plus 3, 101.

01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:23.875
In total, there are 50 pairs of
101.

01:09:28.707 --> 01:09:31.082
Team 2 gets a point.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:40.582
I need to report an incident.

01:09:43.166 --> 01:09:46.750
- Are we done here? - It seems
we are.

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:49.916
What happened?

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:55.291
A student may have brought
contraband to school.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:57.500
"May have brought"?

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.750
Yeah, I'm not certain.

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:03.000
Who's the offender?

01:10:04.083 --> 01:10:05.083
Me.

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:06.500
Come again?

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.458
Yes, maybe I should've reported
the student.

01:10:09.458 --> 01:10:12.000
Isn't that what you're doing
right now?

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.083
Yes.

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:13.208
Yes.
No.

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.875
No.

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:17.708
No, because I'm reporting
myself.

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:18.875
For what?

01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:23.125
For failing to report something
that... Maybe I should have.

01:10:23.125 --> 01:10:25.875
I chose not to look in their
bag.

01:10:25.875 --> 01:10:27.875
So, who is the student?

01:10:27.875 --> 01:10:30.541
No, I can't tell you that.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:34.208
Because technically, there
hasn't been any violation.

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:38.375
And I want to give them an
opportunity.

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:42.083
I just... I'm not sure I did the
right thing.

01:10:42.791 --> 01:10:46.250
This seems more like a
confession than a report.

01:10:46.416 --> 01:10:49.833
I didn't do it just for him. Or
her.

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:52.916
It's just that the whole class
is engaging,

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.583
the method is working.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:58.708
If I report this student now, I
could lose everyone's trust.

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:03.250
It would ruin the whole thing,
and I don't want to lose them.

01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:06.583
So what am I supposed to do?

01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:11.291
Tell me I did the right thing?

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:16.375
Sergio,

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:18.458
the only thing that you did...

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:21.208
was confuse the hell out of me.

01:11:27.458 --> 01:11:29.458
Can I walk you home?

01:11:29.458 --> 01:11:31.083
Don't you live by the beach?

01:11:31.083 --> 01:11:34.291
Yes, but I'm taking the long way
today.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:38.041
Besides, you'll be a lot safer
with me...

01:11:38.666 --> 01:11:40.416
Suit yourself.

01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:44.958
You can build your own rocket,

01:11:44.958 --> 01:11:47.583
and you get to experience a
zero-gravity chamber.

01:11:47.583 --> 01:11:51.083
And look, there's also a
simulation of a failed launch,

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:53.333
where you have to regain
control.

01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:54.375
And get this:

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:59.000
Three students have become real
astronauts.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.291
- Sergio told me that - - Wait a
second.

01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:03.750
Sergio gave you this?

01:12:09.083 --> 01:12:11.083
Wanna see something?

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.666
- Are you okay, Papa? - Yes,
don't worry.

01:12:20.666 --> 01:12:23.875
I'm just a little beat today.

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:27.000
Who's this? Good afternoon. I'm
Nico.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.083
We're partners on a science
project.

01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:33.125
Let me take my bag inside, I'll
be right back.

01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:39.416
Eh, how are you, sir?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.750
Okay.

01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:55.041
Come on.

01:13:01.083 --> 01:13:04.875
- Sorry about the smell. - What
smell?

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.583
Here.

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:15.125
Where did you get that?

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:18.375
I... found it.

01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:20.750
- Whoa. - You haven't seen
anything yet.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.208
Here.

01:13:22.208 --> 01:13:24.750
- What's that? - My tripod.

01:13:28.583 --> 01:13:31.166
Doesn't it have to be nighttime?

01:13:34.041 --> 01:13:35.708
Look.

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:40.416
- Where? - There.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.250
Where the ocean meets the sky.

01:13:43.625 --> 01:13:44.916
What - what's that?

01:13:44.916 --> 01:13:49.125
SpaceX. It's the launch site in
Boca Chica, Texas.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:53.416
Soon the world's biggest rockets
will be launched from there.

01:13:55.041 --> 01:13:57.291
And we can watch them from right
here.

01:14:21.916 --> 01:14:23.708
They're asleep.

01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:30.041
What are you reading?

01:14:30.416 --> 01:14:32.833
About moral dilemmas.

01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:36.583
I don't understand a lot of it,
but it's very interesting.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:38.583
Like...

01:14:38.583 --> 01:14:42.041
let's say you're the captain of
a sinking ship.

01:14:42.041 --> 01:14:46.958
You have 30 passengers, but the
lifeboat only holds 15.

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.208
How do you choose who to save,
and why?

01:14:50.291 --> 01:14:54.958
- What class is that for? - It's
not for school.

01:14:54.958 --> 01:14:58.041
I got it from the university.
For myself.

01:14:58.041 --> 01:14:59.958
Wait, what?

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:04.166
That library is amazing, you
should see it.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:07.125
I thought I'd like to study
philosophy,

01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:11.208
but after seeing all those
books... I dunno.

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:15.750
But I want to be a professor,
that's for sure.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.583
Philosophy?

01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.583
Professor?

01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.208
Honey...

01:15:25.125 --> 01:15:29.083
You're not even going back to
school next year.

01:15:29.166 --> 01:15:33.333
I have to work, who's going to
look after your baby brother,

01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:35.708
huh?

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:43.166
Look, if it means a lot to you
and you really want to,

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:46.041
I'm sure you can get back to it
after, once he's in

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.583
kindergarten.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.041
Let's go, Paloma.

01:16:42.833 --> 01:16:47.208
Oh, there you are! Special
presentation today.

01:16:47.208 --> 01:16:51.666
Your class gets the first slot.
9:00 am. Computer lab.

01:16:51.666 --> 01:16:53.083
Okay.

01:16:53.458 --> 01:16:55.916
The District sent a technician.

01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.958
He'll show some basic concept to
the kids

01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:00.500
He'll explain to them how a
computer works.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.333
Really? Yes, he's setting up
now.

01:17:01.333 --> 01:17:03.416
- Really? - Yes, he's setting up
now.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:06.083
What happened?

01:17:07.041 --> 01:17:09.875
I insisted, I pressed.

01:17:11.166 --> 01:17:13.250
I could kiss you.

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:14.291
Please don't...

01:17:14.291 --> 01:17:16.416
I haven't brushed my teeth.

01:17:18.375 --> 01:17:20.250
See you there.

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:22.750
Nico!

01:17:23.666 --> 01:17:27.125
- How did it go? - I think...
good?

01:17:38.666 --> 01:17:41.708
- What's this? - A little gift.

01:17:41.708 --> 01:17:44.166
Call it a Christmas bonus...

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:49.708
I'm not big on tests, much less
practice ones.

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.708
You see the date?

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:58.583
2012? But that's this year.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:18:02.583
It's not a practice test. It's
the real deal.

01:18:02.958 --> 01:18:06.208
- Where did you get this? - It's
everywhere.

01:18:06.208 --> 01:18:09.041
You just have to know where to
look.

01:18:09.541 --> 01:18:11.416
Thanks but...

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:12.583
No.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:16.916
It's ok. We're all together on
this.

01:18:16.916 --> 01:18:21.125
You can keep doing your thing if
you prepare them with this

01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:23.541
the other teachers won't be so
bothered by your little...

01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:25.750
experiments.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:30.083
Thanks, but... Count me out.

01:18:31.166 --> 01:18:34.250
Thing is, we're evaluated as a
whole.

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:39.416
If your students do poorly, you
bring us all down.

01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:42.541
So you kind of... have to be in.

01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:43.541
What about the kids?

01:18:43.541 --> 01:18:44.666
They'll have no idea.

01:18:44.666 --> 01:18:48.166
If they excel, they graduate. If
they fail, they graduate.

01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:50.541
No matter what happens, they
graduate. That's how it's always

01:18:50.541 --> 01:18:52.000
been.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.291
The only difference is whether
we get a bonus along the way or

01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:56.125
not.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:58.166
No, the only difference

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:01.291
is whether or not we teach them
to cheat.

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.583
That's the difference.

01:19:24.375 --> 01:19:27.041
Laptops? Even better!

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:31.500
- Good morning. - Morning!

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.416
Believing computers are a vital
part of the modern economy...

01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:42.250
- Eh, the government of
Matamoros - - Cut to the chase,

01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:44.583
man.

01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:48.083
Okay.

01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:54.041
This is a CPU, or Central
Processing Unit.

01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:56.708
It's the brain of the
computer...

01:19:56.708 --> 01:20:01.208
The CPU stores the data and
executes

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:04.791
the operations that make a
computer work...

01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:09.250
Did you know that a computer can
execute up to...

01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:14.416
four million commands per
second...

01:20:20.208 --> 01:20:21.291
Hey!

01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:25.750
- What are you doing? - Excuse
me?

01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:29.250
I assume you gave this to my
daughter?

01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:32.250
You must be Paloma's father.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:35.166
Twelve hundred dollars.

01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:38.250
- I don't make that in a year. -
No, no, uh...

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:42.500
They offer scholarships, the
school would recommend her.

01:20:42.625 --> 01:20:45.166
Paloma has a good shot.

01:20:45.166 --> 01:20:48.625
We could hold a fundraiser for
her travel expenses.

01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:51.625
- I'm sure that - - Look,
Maestro.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:52.125
I may be poor.

01:20:52.125 --> 01:20:55.750
I've worked all my life sifting
through trash,

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.958
but I'm no beggar.

01:20:56.958 --> 01:21:00.583
Oh, no, no. That's not what I
meant.

01:21:01.083 --> 01:21:02.666
Look.

01:21:02.666 --> 01:21:06.125
I know this may seem like a big
stretch for you,

01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:09.000
but Paloma isn't just any
student.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:12.708
- She can get that scholarship.
- And then, what?

01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:15.041
When she goes to this "space
camp" and sees all that crazy

01:21:15.041 --> 01:21:17.083
stuff,

01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:20.083
And then returns here? To
reality?

01:21:20.916 --> 01:21:21.791
You know...

01:21:21.791 --> 01:21:25.208
You blast these kids off like
rocket ships into space,

01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.750
after packing their heads with
all these ideas.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.750
But when they leave your class
and return to the real world,

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.375
when they come crashing back
down to earth, where will you be

01:21:32.375 --> 01:21:34.125
then?

01:21:34.125 --> 01:21:39.208
Will you be here to catch them
and tell them to keep trying?

01:21:39.375 --> 01:21:40.208
No...

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:44.875
You'll be filling another bunch
of heads with your crazy ideas,

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:47.583
reminding them of what they
can't have,

01:21:47.583 --> 01:21:49.541
what they can never be.

01:21:49.541 --> 01:21:51.083
Papa?

01:21:51.958 --> 01:21:53.875
Please, Maestro.

01:21:54.416 --> 01:21:57.041
Don't do that to my daughter.

01:21:57.625 --> 01:21:59.250
Come on, Paloma.

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:36.958
- You can't go in! - Excuse me.

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:39.125
- I know you're busy. - I tried
to stop him.

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:41.875
- Sorry to interrupt, but - -
Who are you?

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:43.708
I'm Sergio Juárez Correa.

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:46.666
I teach at Escuela Primaria José
Urbina López.

01:22:46.666 --> 01:22:49.083
I wanted to talk to you about...

01:22:49.375 --> 01:22:52.083
About the situation with...

01:22:52.083 --> 01:22:54.041
with our computers.

01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:56.208
It's fine, Martha.

01:22:56.208 --> 01:23:01.916
We always make time for our
soldiers on the front line.

01:23:03.083 --> 01:23:06.291
- Interesting choice of words. -
Pardon me?

01:23:06.291 --> 01:23:09.375
Soldier. Front lines...

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:12.708
As if I were at war, fighting an
enemy.

01:23:12.708 --> 01:23:14.458
But no. I...

01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:16.708
I spend all day with...

01:23:16.708 --> 01:23:18.166
Children.

01:23:20.916 --> 01:23:22.708
So, tell me...

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:25.583
How can I help you?

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.083
Nacho asked about you today.

01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:58.750
"When is the pretty boy going to
start?"

01:23:58.750 --> 01:24:02.416
Now that school's winding down,
he wants to show you the ropes.

01:24:04.541 --> 01:24:06.083
What is it?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.041
Do you see out there?

01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:11.000
You can't tell where the ocean
ends

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.708
and the sky begins.

01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:17.375
Did you know that right now,
technically,

01:24:17.375 --> 01:24:20.250
we're standing in outer space?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.208
What?

01:24:23.208 --> 01:24:25.916
Yeah, it comes all the way down
to here.

01:24:25.916 --> 01:24:30.166
What we think of as the sky is
just a layer of gas.

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:34.583
It doesn't feel like there's
anything, it seems empty,

01:24:35.083 --> 01:24:37.333
but it actually has mass -

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:39.000
like weight -

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.416
and it's always being pulled
towards Earth.

01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:44.875
It's trapped here.

01:24:45.291 --> 01:24:47.250
Just like we are.

01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:56.208
- Hey, I'm not going to work for
Nacho. - Are you serious?

01:24:56.208 --> 01:24:59.041
But you hate school. What
happened?

01:24:59.041 --> 01:25:02.958
I don't know. I just... like it.

01:25:02.958 --> 01:25:05.833
There's this teacher,

01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:08.083
who does things differently.

01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:11.916
With him, I think I could
actually be smart.

01:25:13.791 --> 01:25:15.666
And, there's this girl...

01:25:15.666 --> 01:25:19.083
Ha! The truth comes out.

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:21.708
Check out our little Don Juan!

01:25:22.458 --> 01:25:23.625
Listen...

01:25:23.625 --> 01:25:25.041
If you had a shot to do
something else, I'd want you to

01:25:25.041 --> 01:25:27.541
take it.

01:25:27.541 --> 01:25:30.666
But with Nacho, once you're in,
you're never out.

01:25:30.666 --> 01:25:33.875
But I was never really in...

01:25:34.208 --> 01:25:35.708
Right?

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:47.291
Hey! Need a ride?

01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:52.041
I was enjoying the walk, but
sure.

01:26:02.708 --> 01:26:06.708
Your car in the shop? Yeah.

01:26:07.125 --> 01:26:08.541
Forever.

01:26:09.083 --> 01:26:12.083
I traded it for something more
useful.

01:26:12.083 --> 01:26:14.583
Is that what I think it is?

01:26:15.916 --> 01:26:18.208
Now you'll see what they can do.

01:26:18.208 --> 01:26:23.000
- You didn't have to do that. -
Oh, I did.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.791
- I'm sorry, I really thought -
- It's okay, I know.

01:26:26.791 --> 01:26:30.750
In fact, I really appreciate
your effort.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:34.416
Your wife didn't get mad?

01:26:37.083 --> 01:26:39.750
- Are you married? - No.

01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:41.041
Good, because...

01:26:41.041 --> 01:26:44.416
I think I'll be staying at your
place for a while.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.750
His approach is unorthodox, but
the results are compelling.

01:27:01.041 --> 01:27:02.583
Yes, I'm sure.

01:27:08.166 --> 01:27:11.375
We have visitors. To what do we
owe the honor?

01:27:11.375 --> 01:27:13.750
I take it you know each other -

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.166
What are you doing?

01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:16.750
Meditating.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:20.541
We were having a discussion and
things got pretty intense,

01:27:20.541 --> 01:27:24.750
so we were taking a moment to
cool down.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.166
Don't mind me. Please, continue.

01:27:27.166 --> 01:27:29.041
I'm just here to observe.

01:27:29.041 --> 01:27:31.083
What were you discussing?

01:27:32.041 --> 01:27:35.083
We were discussing... morality.

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:37.041
Morality?

01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:40.291
That's not a subject we're
familiar with.

01:27:40.291 --> 01:27:44.875
According to the lesson plan...
March 20th...

01:27:44.875 --> 01:27:48.833
you should be preparing for the
ENLACE test.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:52.750
Yeah, but Lupita has taken an
interest in philosophy.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.375
Philosophy? And she was sharing
with the class

01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:58.208
some of the things she has
learned.

01:27:58.625 --> 01:28:01.041
Last year, in the fifth grade,

01:28:01.041 --> 01:28:06.041
this class's scores were among
the worst in the nation.

01:28:06.041 --> 01:28:08.666
I find it strange you have time
to do anything but prepare for

01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:11.083
the test.

01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:13.041
Well, like I said.

01:28:13.041 --> 01:28:15.875
Someone told Lupita she was far
too young

01:28:15.875 --> 01:28:17.416
to read about philosophy.

01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:19.875
So, we were trying to see if it
could answer some difficult

01:28:19.875 --> 01:28:22.083
questions.

01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:25.250
Like which?

01:28:27.458 --> 01:28:29.250
I wanted to know what John
Stuart Mill would say about

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:31.666
abortion.

01:28:31.666 --> 01:28:32.541
Abortion?

01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:37.125
- And what do you think he'd
say? - Well...

01:28:38.083 --> 01:28:44.041
If we want the greatest good for
the greatest number of people,

01:28:44.041 --> 01:28:46.791
I think that if you're
struggling to afford rent and

01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:48.958
food,

01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:51.875
It's better not to bring more
children into the world who are

01:28:51.875 --> 01:28:54.000
only going to suffer.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.916
And that would also cause more
suffering for others.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.000
So, yes.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.083
There are cases where abortion
might be the right thing to do.

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:05.000
My god.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.416
So, how do you feel about this
conclusion?

01:29:10.958 --> 01:29:15.125
Well, I think about my own
siblings.

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:19.125
Sometimes they are a lot of
work,

01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:24.583
but I also don't like imagining
them not having been born.

01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:27.750
I don't know.

01:29:28.958 --> 01:29:31.250
It's very complicated.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.125
But it's cool.

01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:35.833
We all agreed that condoms are
the obvious answer.

01:29:35.833 --> 01:29:38.875
- Condoms?! - Well, not everyone
agrees.

01:29:38.875 --> 01:29:42.583
In fact, we had quite a debate
about that, didn't we?

01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:47.000
According to Stuart Mill,
something can be good or bad

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.416
depending on the situation.

01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:52.041
Is there something that in his
view

01:29:52.041 --> 01:29:55.208
would always be immoral in every
case?

01:29:55.583 --> 01:29:59.583
Anything that hurts many for the
benefit of a few.

01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:00.333
Like what?

01:30:00.333 --> 01:30:05.125
Like if someone steals something
that is meant for everybody?

01:30:05.125 --> 01:30:09.750
Very good, Nico. So something
like...

01:30:11.208 --> 01:30:12.875
Corruption?

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:19.041
Given you have the time to
discuss such advanced subjects

01:30:19.041 --> 01:30:19.333
in class,

01:30:19.333 --> 01:30:24.875
You must have total command of
the basic sixth grade skills

01:30:25.166 --> 01:30:27.208
You, tell me...

01:30:27.208 --> 01:30:31.000
What's the square root of 256?

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:31.041
What's the square root of 256?
What is that supposed to show?

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:33.166
What is that supposed to show?

01:30:33.166 --> 01:30:38.583
No? With whom was Mexico at war
in 1846?

01:30:39.041 --> 01:30:43.208
He hasn't gone over that yet,
he's -

01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:47.125
Explain Darwin's Theory of
Evolution.

01:30:47.333 --> 01:30:49.125
Hold on -

01:30:54.125 --> 01:30:55.833
As I suspected...

01:30:55.833 --> 01:30:58.750
This child lacks the basic
knowledge expected from a sixth

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.083
grader.

01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:04.458
Mr. Juárez, he's the
definition...

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.041
...of an ignoramus.

01:31:06.041 --> 01:31:09.000
Now wait - Hey Nico!

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.791
And undisciplined too!

01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:14.333
What's wrong with you? Why did
you do that?

01:31:14.333 --> 01:31:16.000
To me, say what you want, but
don't you talk to the kids that

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.041
way.

01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:22.125
The square root of 256 is 16.

01:31:22.208 --> 01:31:26.125
Mexico fought the U.S. in 1846.

01:31:26.583 --> 01:31:31.291
Darwin's theory of Evolution is
the survival of the fittest.

01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:40.083
Thank you, Mr. Juárez. See me in
the Director's Office.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.333
I've been thinking about our
game from the first day,

01:32:02.333 --> 01:32:04.750
remember?

01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:07.541
The boats and the passengers?

01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:10.208
There's an obvious solution.

01:32:10.541 --> 01:32:13.958
You shouldn't sell more tickets
than there are spaces in the

01:32:13.958 --> 01:32:16.125
lifeboats.

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:31.208
- Wait, Sergio. - I bet he's
taking bribes from those

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:32.125
assholes!

01:32:32.125 --> 01:32:34.125
Wait, Sergio!

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:37.875
I asked you not to kick the
hornet's nest, and what did you

01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:38.333
do!?

01:32:38.333 --> 01:32:41.208
Abortion? Condoms? Corruption?!

01:32:41.208 --> 01:32:44.583
I can't ask my students to be
fearless learners, to do

01:32:44.583 --> 01:32:45.166
whatever it takes -

01:32:45.166 --> 01:32:48.375
to go wherever their inquiries
take them -

01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:49.708
And then what?

01:32:49.708 --> 01:32:52.166
Turn into a bootlicker right in
front of them?

01:32:52.166 --> 01:32:53.958
Think of the big picture

01:32:53.958 --> 01:32:57.000
What matters is that they keep
you as their teacher.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:00.041
So what if you have to lick a
few boots?

01:33:00.125 --> 01:33:01.541
Are you serious?

01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:08.458
Mr. Director? I'm waiting...

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:10.583
Right away, sir.

01:33:16.625 --> 01:33:19.041
Mr. Juárez...

01:33:19.041 --> 01:33:24.208
I must say I was very disturbed
to receive numerous complaints

01:33:24.208 --> 01:33:27.125
that your kids aren't being
prepared for the ENLACE test,

01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:31.333
But I didn't imagine the
situation would be this bad.

01:33:31.333 --> 01:33:34.875
So you are hereby suspended for
two weeks.

01:33:34.875 --> 01:33:35.083
What?!

01:33:35.083 --> 01:33:37.250
Until after your class has been
prepared for the ENLACE test,

01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:40.250
For which you have obviously so
little regard -

01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:41.541
Look...

01:33:42.250 --> 01:33:45.333
You're right, I won't deny it.

01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:47.166
I think it's a useless test.

01:33:47.166 --> 01:33:49.416
but don't take that out on the
kids.

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:52.208
OK I'll do it, I'll prepare
them.

01:33:52.208 --> 01:33:55.083
For the next two weeks, that's
all we'll do: prepare for the

01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:57.208
ENLACE.

01:33:57.208 --> 01:34:01.250
But please... don't suspend me.

01:34:01.416 --> 01:34:03.666
To bring in anyone else but me
to prepare them would just be...

01:34:03.666 --> 01:34:06.208
stupidity.

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:10.208
You can thank your Director that
this is only a suspension,

01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:12.041
and not a permanent dismissal.

01:34:12.041 --> 01:34:15.166
But to be honest, I'm starting
to reconsider my decision.

01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:18.083
That won't be necessary.

01:34:18.708 --> 01:34:20.500
That won't be necessary.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.708
Anything else to add?

01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:24.708
No.

01:34:25.875 --> 01:34:28.083
Good day, Professors.

01:34:36.291 --> 01:34:40.083
This is insane, Chucho.

01:34:40.083 --> 01:34:44.041
Did you know that in my class,
right here in this school,

01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:47.291
there's a girl who I'm sure is a
certifiable genius?

01:34:47.291 --> 01:34:49.958
The only thing you knew about
her before I got here was that

01:34:49.958 --> 01:34:52.583
"she could apply herself more."

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:54.291
Really?

01:34:54.291 --> 01:34:58.166
How many kids in this country
could be like her?

01:34:58.166 --> 01:35:01.083
But as long as we tolerate this
deliberate ignorance, we will

01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:03.541
never know.

01:35:03.541 --> 01:35:05.166
I'm sorry, Sergio.

01:35:05.166 --> 01:35:07.250
My hands are tied. Yeah, yeah.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:09.458
Consider it a vacation.

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:12.708
Go spend some time with your
wife and baby.

01:35:34.375 --> 01:35:36.291
Hey, you okay?

01:35:47.625 --> 01:35:50.166
You know? You're not stupid.

01:35:50.166 --> 01:35:54.583
Or an ignoramus, or whatever
that man called you.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.416
I mean it.

01:35:56.416 --> 01:35:59.041
You always come up with the most
clever things to say, so

01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:01.000
quickly...

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.583
I could never do that.

01:36:29.458 --> 01:36:32.416
There's the pretty boy!

01:36:33.666 --> 01:36:38.000
Chepe says you're confused about
who you work for?

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.875
I couldn't believe it, so I
wanted to see for myself...

01:36:42.625 --> 01:36:45.875
So? Do you work for me, or not?

01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:54.708
It suddenly occurs to me that
the reason you're confused

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:59.083
is because we never gave you a
proper welcome to the family.

01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:02.083
A real initiation, you know?

01:37:07.041 --> 01:37:08.125
Who's this?

01:37:08.125 --> 01:37:10.250
She's no one, just a friend.

01:37:10.333 --> 01:37:12.083
Go home.

01:37:12.708 --> 01:37:15.083
- Hang on, love. - Hey!

01:37:15.083 --> 01:37:16.875
- What's going on? - Are you a
virgin?

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:17.958
- What?! - Nacho, don't!

01:37:17.958 --> 01:37:20.833
- She'll do. - She's just a kid,
man!

01:37:20.833 --> 01:37:21.041
Hey!

01:37:21.041 --> 01:37:23.916
Look at your brother, trying to
act tough!

01:37:23.916 --> 01:37:26.958
They're just kids, man!

01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:29.208
- Wait, Nico! - What the fuck?!

01:37:58.333 --> 01:38:00.708
Lupe... Lupe!

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:02.875
Are you okay?!

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.708
Are you all okay?

01:38:18.958 --> 01:38:20.416
Are you ok?

01:38:20.791 --> 01:38:23.125
Paloma, are you all right?!

01:38:26.375 --> 01:38:28.083
Nico...

01:38:28.083 --> 01:38:29.583
Nico...

01:39:33.458 --> 01:39:37.541
Carlos ate 3/8 of the pizza,

01:39:37.541 --> 01:39:42.541
whereas Ricardo ate 1/4 of the
same pizza.

01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:48.750
How much of the pizza did Carlos
and Ricardo eat?

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:51.916
Anyone?

01:40:07.708 --> 01:40:09.625
Good morning, Laura.

01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:11.083
What a surprise.

01:40:11.083 --> 01:40:14.208
Maybe you can get him out of
bed.

01:40:16.166 --> 01:40:17.583
Excuse me.

01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:35.291
Can we talk for a minute?

01:40:39.958 --> 01:40:42.666
Sergio, the ENLACE test is
tomorrow.

01:40:42.666 --> 01:40:46.250
That means your suspension is
over.

01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:51.250
We're understaffed, we could use
your help.

01:40:52.791 --> 01:40:55.750
We haven't heard anything from
you.

01:40:57.375 --> 01:41:00.583
I need to know if you're coming
back.

01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:10.000
You know I couldn't do anything
about what happened.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.583
You know I was against it.

01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.541
Sergio, open up!

01:41:25.208 --> 01:41:29.083
I'm not leaving. I'm staying
right here.

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:33.041
I'm going to eat your food, crap
in your toilet...

01:41:33.208 --> 01:41:37.416
Whatever it takes, I'm not
leaving until you come out.

01:41:42.416 --> 01:41:44.291
Sergio...

01:41:44.416 --> 01:41:47.583
You can't walk out on these
children.

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:51.125
They're traumatized enough as it
is.

01:41:53.041 --> 01:41:57.208
Maybe it's the best way to
prepare them for the future.

01:41:57.583 --> 01:42:00.083
- Hi, how are you? - Go.

01:42:01.041 --> 01:42:02.958
Seriously?

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:06.291
That's it? You're gonna give up
so easily?

01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:08.041
Yeah, why not?

01:42:08.041 --> 01:42:11.583
You don't want to finish what
you started?

01:42:15.875 --> 01:42:16.791
Sergio...

01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:20.208
You saw for yourself that you
were succeeding.

01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:24.041
Want to know what I succeeded
at?

01:42:24.583 --> 01:42:29.166
I succeeded at getting... they
killed... one of my...

01:42:29.166 --> 01:42:30.166
Look, look...

01:42:30.166 --> 01:42:32.291
If you don't want to, you don't
have to come back...

01:42:32.291 --> 01:42:35.166
Great, so why are you here?

01:42:35.166 --> 01:42:35.208
Great, so why are you here?
For the kids...

01:42:35.208 --> 01:42:36.708
For the kids...

01:42:36.708 --> 01:42:39.250
I want to get my kids back.

01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:41.916
They stopped coming?

01:42:42.083 --> 01:42:44.083
I want them to take the ENLACE
test.

01:42:44.083 --> 01:42:47.250
That fucking test...

01:42:47.625 --> 01:42:49.416
Chucho...

01:42:49.875 --> 01:42:52.083
Look, like I told you...

01:42:55.083 --> 01:42:57.208
I failed...

01:42:57.208 --> 01:42:58.416
Them -

01:42:59.041 --> 01:43:00.125
Nico.

01:43:00.125 --> 01:43:01.666
I thought...

01:43:01.666 --> 01:43:04.875
I thought I was doing things the
right way.

01:43:06.166 --> 01:43:07.125
Really, but -

01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:09.916
I should've checked the
backpack...

01:43:09.916 --> 01:43:12.000
No, if I come back they're just
going to end up paying the

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.125
price.

01:43:15.708 --> 01:43:17.583
Again.

01:43:20.125 --> 01:43:24.000
- Sorry... - Wait a minute,
Sergio.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:24.125
- Sorry... - Wait a minute,
Sergio.
I really do think you were on
the verge of something big with

01:43:24.125 --> 01:43:25.958
I really do think you were on
the verge of something big with

01:43:25.958 --> 01:43:28.083
them.

01:43:30.041 --> 01:43:32.166
I saw it myself.

01:43:32.916 --> 01:43:36.833
I have never seen children
respond like that before. Ever!

01:43:36.833 --> 01:43:40.500
Or make such progress in so
little time.

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.333
But no one gives a shit what we
think of this method.

01:43:43.333 --> 01:43:46.166
No one will care unless we show
measurable results.

01:43:46.166 --> 01:43:48.666
That's what the test is for.

01:43:48.666 --> 01:43:53.041
You said it yourself. Paloma
might be a genius.

01:43:53.166 --> 01:43:55.583
But, how would we know -

01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:59.916
Paloma stopped coming?

01:44:49.125 --> 01:44:51.083
Good afternoon.

01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:06.041
Paloma?

01:45:50.166 --> 01:45:52.625
What are you doing here?

01:45:52.625 --> 01:45:56.208
The director said he'd leave me
alone if

01:45:57.333 --> 01:46:00.291
...I convince you to come back
to school.

01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:02.916
You're not going back?

01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:07.750
I don't know if I can.

01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:09.458
Why not?

01:46:11.041 --> 01:46:13.708
Maybe your dad was right...

01:46:15.541 --> 01:46:18.708
Maybe I've done more harm than
good.

01:46:20.208 --> 01:46:22.250
I can't come back.

01:46:22.791 --> 01:46:26.875
I have to look after him now.
He's sick.

01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:37.416
I'm so sorry, Paloma.

01:46:41.083 --> 01:46:43.208
I'm so sorry.

01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:46.916
But my dad wasn't right...

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:52.541
You told us we had as much
potential as any other kid.

01:46:53.541 --> 01:46:58.416
But what we didn't have before
you, was the belief...

01:46:58.416 --> 01:47:01.166
That we could fulfill it.

01:47:01.166 --> 01:47:03.000
I never could have allowed
myself to imagine the things I

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.583
did in your class.

01:47:05.833 --> 01:47:10.041
About who I could be, what I
could do.

01:47:10.583 --> 01:47:14.000
And that's something I get to
have now.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:17.250
I wouldn't have that if it
weren't for you.

01:47:18.791 --> 01:47:20.291
And I'll never...

01:47:21.791 --> 01:47:23.750
ever forget that.

01:47:26.541 --> 01:47:29.916
But sometimes, believing is not
enough.

01:47:31.166 --> 01:47:33.208
Sometimes...

01:47:33.958 --> 01:47:36.250
the reality is the reality.

01:47:36.458 --> 01:47:38.541
Look around...

01:47:39.875 --> 01:47:42.708
This is my reality.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.583
There's no escaping it.

01:47:46.416 --> 01:47:48.416
And people like me...

01:47:50.041 --> 01:47:52.125
like Nico...

01:47:57.083 --> 01:47:59.125
We don't get to escape.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.083
I understand.

01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:33.750
Mr. Juárez.

01:48:34.458 --> 01:48:36.250
Mr. Noyola.

01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:40.125
Paloma doesn't need this
anymore.

01:48:40.583 --> 01:48:44.958
You should take it back. It
might get damaged here.

01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:48.208
But... what is it?

01:48:49.291 --> 01:48:54.750
She borrowed it from school, for
a science project.

01:48:57.166 --> 01:49:01.041
The school could never afford
something like this.

01:49:08.916 --> 01:49:11.083
She didn't borrow this.

01:49:12.208 --> 01:49:13.375
She made it.

01:49:13.375 --> 01:49:15.208
What...?

01:49:15.583 --> 01:49:17.458
That's impossible.

01:49:17.458 --> 01:49:20.875
Isn't everything impossible
until it is done?

01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:24.708
Wow.

01:49:24.708 --> 01:49:27.916
Paloma is an extraordinary girl,
Mr. Noyola.

01:49:29.166 --> 01:49:32.583
I only wonder if you know just
how extraordinary.

01:49:33.375 --> 01:49:36.083
Don't say that, Maestro.

01:49:36.083 --> 01:49:37.750
This is hers.

01:49:38.583 --> 01:49:39.875
It's hers.

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:53.041
Can we make one more stop?

01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.250
Paloma?

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:16.208
You should be resting, Papa.

01:51:17.083 --> 01:51:19.875
Come, sit with me.

01:51:22.041 --> 01:51:24.208
Are you feeling all right?

01:51:56.166 --> 01:51:58.416
It's all gonna be ok.

01:54:08.166 --> 01:54:12.875
That list of yours... have phone
numbers?

01:55:09.166 --> 01:55:10.583
Profe?

01:55:13.125 --> 01:55:14.875
Look at that!

01:55:21.583 --> 01:55:23.083
Over there.

01:55:24.208 --> 01:55:26.250
Sit wherever you like.

01:55:44.833 --> 01:55:47.208
Hurry up, everyone.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:52.458
- C'mon, guys, we're running
late! - I'm coming!

01:56:05.083 --> 01:56:08.250
How are we doing?

01:56:08.375 --> 01:56:10.708
Just a few more.

01:56:12.375 --> 01:56:13.875
Look.

01:56:14.166 --> 01:56:16.000
- What's up with him? - Due to
numerous reports of

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.166
irregularities,

01:56:18.166 --> 01:56:20.625
they decided to change this
year's test.

01:56:20.625 --> 01:56:26.416
Perhaps they got a lot of tips
from concerned citizens.

01:56:28.083 --> 01:56:32.083
At least we're all on a level
playing field.

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.541
What?

01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.458
Everyone take your seats...

01:56:41.458 --> 01:56:45.000
Do not touch the materials in
front of you until the test

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.416
begins.

01:58:02.541 --> 01:58:06.083
Ok everyone, let's quiet down
please.

01:58:06.625 --> 01:58:09.166
We're about to begin.

01:58:11.916 --> 01:58:14.208
All right guys, listen; real
quick.

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.791
This test measures how much you
know, okay?

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:21.375
Maybe... this year I didn't
teach you everything you need to

01:58:21.375 --> 01:58:23.750
know.

01:58:24.375 --> 01:58:26.166
But you did learn how to think.

01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:29.208
So, there might be some things
that you don't recognize...

01:58:29.208 --> 01:58:33.208
but there's nothing in this test
you can't figure out.

01:58:33.375 --> 01:58:35.041
Okay?

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:35.083
Okay?
Got it?

01:58:35.083 --> 01:58:36.583
Got it?

01:58:41.583 --> 01:58:43.166
Actually...

01:58:48.250 --> 01:58:52.041
Actually there is one thing I
want you to know before you take

01:58:52.041 --> 01:58:54.416
this test:

01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:08.041
You have all taught me so...
very much.

01:59:08.208 --> 01:59:16.208
And I am so very proud of each
and every single one of you.

01:59:22.083 --> 01:59:25.416
All right! Now let's go kick
some ass!

01:59:37.083 --> 01:59:41.250
You will have three hours to
complete the test.

01:59:43.416 --> 01:59:48.583
You should try to answer as many
questions as you can.

01:59:50.333 --> 01:59:57.125
Any answers left blank will
count against you

02:00:00.541 --> 02:00:02.125
Good luck!

02:00:19.125 --> 02:00:20.708
And...

02:00:20.916 --> 02:00:23.041
...let's begin.

02:00:24.375 --> 02:00:26.791
The year before Sergio's
arrival, only 55% of his

02:00:26.791 --> 02:00:30.208
students passed the ENLACE in
Math and 69% in Language.

02:00:30.208 --> 02:00:33.208
None received a score of
"Excellent."

02:00:33.208 --> 02:00:35.000
In 2012, after a year with
Sergio,

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.375
93% passed the Mathematics
portion, with 63% scoring

02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:38.000
"Excellent",

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.333
and 97.5% passed the Language
portion, with 72% scoring

02:00:39.333 --> 02:00:41.166
"Excellent".

02:00:41.166 --> 02:00:44.375
Ten of Sergio's students scored
in the top 0.1% nationally in

02:00:44.375 --> 02:00:46.875
Mathematics.

02:00:47.833 --> 02:00:50.625
Paloma Noyola achieved the
highest score...

02:00:50.625 --> 02:00:53.083
...in all of Mexico.

02:00:53.083 --> 02:00:55.875
She became a national sensation
and received a private grant

02:00:55.875 --> 02:00:59.041
that allowed her to move to a
new home.

02:00:59.291 --> 02:01:02.666
Sergio Juárez Correa still lives
in Matamoros

02:01:02.666 --> 02:01:06.208
where he continues to teach
sixth grade.

02:01:06.208 --> 02:01:09.125
José Urbina López Elementary
School still has no computer

02:01:09.125 --> 02:01:11.416
lab.

02:01:48.458 --> 02:01:54.208
Like a flame flickering in the
wind

02:01:56.083 --> 02:02:01.583
It's the sand that rises

02:02:03.458 --> 02:02:08.541
The sorrow that time heals

02:02:08.541 --> 02:02:15.625
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

02:02:15.625 --> 02:02:23.208
The sun will rise, come morning
light

02:02:28.750 --> 02:02:34.041
Like the angel of destiny

02:02:36.208 --> 02:02:41.125
Casts stones along the way

02:02:43.125 --> 02:02:48.375
It's my voice, my light, my
heartbeat

02:02:48.375 --> 02:02:56.083
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

02:02:56.083 --> 02:03:03.208
The sun will rise, come morning
light

02:03:05.583 --> 02:03:11.208
The laughter that sweetens life

02:03:11.791 --> 02:03:17.291
The fight I embrace each new day

02:03:19.083 --> 02:03:24.791
All those pearls are hidden

02:03:24.791 --> 02:03:32.458
In the darkness they'll remain.

02:03:39.208 --> 02:03:43.083
Let's push against the current

02:03:43.083 --> 02:03:46.500
Through seas and rivers, a tidal
surge

02:03:46.500 --> 02:03:50.375
A strong burst of faith is
what's needed

02:03:50.375 --> 02:03:54.041
Where will it lead?

02:04:04.625 --> 02:04:08.583
Where will they go?

02:04:14.541 --> 02:04:19.166
The light looks at us serene

02:04:21.875 --> 02:04:26.083
Restless upon waking

02:04:29.083 --> 02:04:34.125
A song that lives and resonates

02:04:34.125 --> 02:04:41.166
And knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

02:04:41.166 --> 02:04:48.750
The sun will rise, come morning
light

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:56.083
It's knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

02:04:56.083 --> 02:05:03.625
The sun will rise, come morning
light

02:05:03.708 --> 02:05:10.833
Knowing, knowing, knowing,
knowing

02:05:10.833 --> 02:05:23.041
The sun will rise, come morning
light

02:05:26.166 --> 02:05:27.916
“The only thing that interferes
with my learning is my

02:05:27.916 --> 02:05:30.041
education”

02:05:30.041 --> 02:05:33.083
Albert Einstein
