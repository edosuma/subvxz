06:55.875 --> 06:58.373
Hello, Jonathan Winterspeak.

06:58.375 --> 06:59.748
Angela Summering.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.873
You recognize me.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.748
That is a good sign.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.164
What are you doing here?

07:06.166 --> 07:07.623
How?

07:07.625 --> 07:09.373
Don’t matter your brain with me

07:09.375 --> 07:10.581
or how I’m here,

07:10.583 --> 07:13.289
for that is not for you to worry about.

07:13.291 --> 07:16.248
What matters is what I have to tell you.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.498
What is it you have to tell me?

07:18.500 --> 07:20.957
Do you ever think about my death?

07:20.959 --> 07:22.248
Yes.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.623
Yes, I try to erase you.

07:24.625 --> 07:28.248
You cannot erase an artifact of the heart.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.082
No.

07:29.084 --> 07:30.623
No, try as I did,

07:30.625 --> 07:32.748
I did try.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.042
Jonathan! Look out!

07:36.583 --> 07:38.831
Gimme all your money, white boy.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.373
You know who I am.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.581
Do me at least the courtesy of admitting that.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.289
You were sent for me.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.873
Yo, yo, pretty smart for a white boy

07:45.875 --> 07:47.623
bout to die.

07:47.625 --> 07:48.957
I don’t wanna hurt you.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.581
Just go.

07:50.583 --> 07:51.831
Jonathan.

07:51.833 --> 07:53.583
Jonathan, wake up.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.289
I couldn’t let you do that.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.873
Are you an angel now?

08:11.875 --> 08:14.289
We don’t think of it like that where I am.

08:14.291 --> 08:16.082
That is an earth word.

08:16.084 --> 08:18.373
But yes.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.831
Did it hurt?

08:20.833 --> 08:22.665
When I

08:22.667 --> 08:23.957
killed you?

08:23.959 --> 08:25.831
No.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.625
Because you were full of love.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.831
I’m not mad.

08:34.832 --> 08:36.832
I’m where I’m supposed to be.

08:38.582 --> 08:40.873
I should be where you are.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.748
Not you.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.581
Jonathan.

08:44.583 --> 08:47.373
Jonathan, you are.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.373
What are you saying?

08:49.375 --> 08:50.581
Don’t you ever wonder

08:50.583 --> 08:53.456
why you can’t read that letter?

08:53.458 --> 08:55.082
What?

08:55.084 --> 08:57.581
Do you ever think about why?

08:57.583 --> 08:58.581
I don’t understand

08:58.583 --> 09:00.748
what you’re saying to me.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.959
You were killed, Jonathan.

09:06.291 --> 09:08.248
Was it by a gangster?

09:08.250 --> 09:10.581
It was by you.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.957
You couldn’t live with the remorse

09:11.959 --> 09:13.581
of killing me.

09:13.583 --> 09:15.623
And your love for me.

09:15.625 --> 09:17.581
I knew you loved me.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.373
That’s why it didn’t hurt.

09:20.375 --> 09:23.248
I don’t remember feeling anything.

09:23.250 --> 09:25.164
Because you love yourself.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.748
You do.

09:26.750 --> 09:27.748
I always believed it,

09:27.750 --> 09:29.581
even if you didn’t.

09:29.583 --> 09:31.456
Even when we were on the run.

09:31.458 --> 09:32.873
Avoiding gangs.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.082
Avoiding my father.

09:35.084 --> 09:36.248
Even when you stayed up

09:36.250 --> 09:37.373
all night saying you wanted

09:37.375 --> 09:38.581
to commit suicide for all the

09:38.583 --> 09:41.082
people you’ve killed.

09:41.084 --> 09:42.873
And you’d drink.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.581
And you’d hit me.

09:44.583 --> 09:45.957
And I’d hit you.

09:45.959 --> 09:47.748
And you’d drink some more.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.665
And then you’d go out and kill.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.373
Just so we could have money.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.164
Contract killing jobs,

09:54.166 --> 09:55.957
just for me.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.456
Freelance contract killing jobs,

09:58.458 --> 09:59.873
for me.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.957
For us.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.581
Stop.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.458
I’m glad to know I was right.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.748
Even if we can’t be alive,

10:09.750 --> 10:13.373
it is good to be right.

10:13.375 --> 10:14.583
Why?

10:15.959 --> 10:18.623
Because I loved you.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.456
What?

10:20.458 --> 10:21.873
I loved you.

10:21.875 --> 10:24.250
I love you, I love you.

10:30.458 --> 10:32.750
Open your eyes, Jonathan.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.623
Here we go!

13:36.625 --> 13:39.540
William Alexander Genovet.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.540
- Name's gonna be known.
- That motherfucker.

13:41.542 --> 13:43.040
Yeah, that's me.

13:43.042 --> 13:45.333
Why are you actin' like I'm not in the room?

13:48.708 --> 13:51.331
Yo motherfucker, get some stable hands,

13:51.333 --> 13:52.414
they're just, like,

13:52.416 --> 13:54.456
Okay, we both filmed stuff, okay?

13:54.458 --> 13:55.998
That was you, but!

13:56.959 --> 13:58.623
- Well, not all of it.
- Don't, don't be,

13:58.625 --> 14:00.331
yeah, but that exact shot was you,

14:00.333 --> 14:03.581
don't be putting it on me!

14:03.583 --> 14:05.915
I like the trees in that part.

14:05.917 --> 14:07.708
Yeah.

14:10.542 --> 14:12.540
Artifact of a love.

14:12.542 --> 14:14.706
I, I hate this font.

14:14.708 --> 14:16.915
It's an artsy font. It's, like,

14:16.917 --> 14:18.540
it's a good font.

14:18.542 --> 14:20.331
It's not boring.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.708
What do you want, Times New Roman?

14:25.416 --> 14:26.831
- There she is!
- Oh yeah.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.042
Courtney!

14:34.583 --> 14:37.833
Like, the I in Sai looks like an L.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.331
Yeah, but that's your fault for having

14:40.333 --> 14:41.498
an I at the end of your name.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.748
Motherfucker, that's your fault because you

14:43.750 --> 14:45.123
can't pick a good font!

14:45.125 --> 14:48.123
My name looks awesome. Look at that.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.123
Yeah.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.540
William Alexander Genovet.

14:50.542 --> 14:52.414
It only looks awesome, it's not.

14:52.416 --> 14:55.123
- Yes, it is.
- That's the only awesome part about it.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.917
Okay. Sure.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.123
Yo, how long is this shit?

15:04.125 --> 15:05.540
It's the opening titles.

15:05.542 --> 15:07.833
Like, it's who worked on the film.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.623
Look, I directed this film, so,

15:12.625 --> 15:14.542
keep that in mind.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.540
Did you not know that?

15:19.542 --> 15:21.123
Was that an afterthought you just had?

15:21.125 --> 15:23.456
No, but when you see this wonderful

15:23.458 --> 15:24.540
piece of art,

15:24.542 --> 15:27.581
- Yeah, with the shaky hands at the start of it!
- It should just be, just,

15:27.583 --> 15:28.706
That one shot,

15:28.708 --> 15:31.123
- you had one job in that shot.
- Okay, shut up, here we go.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.540
Look, that's me.

15:32.542 --> 15:35.040
Oh, pathetic acting, here we come.

15:35.042 --> 15:36.581
'Pathetic acting'. I did fine.

15:36.583 --> 15:37.706
I think I did a good job.

15:37.708 --> 15:39.331
That's one of the parts I'm proud of,

15:39.333 --> 15:41.123
of this film.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.331
Yeah. I'll let you think that.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.331
Wait, wait, wait, it's coming.

15:46.333 --> 15:47.248
Boom!

15:47.250 --> 15:48.082
- There she is.
- Oh.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.082
Look at her run.

15:50.084 --> 15:51.706
We should have got a close up of that.

15:51.708 --> 15:52.831
Yeah.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.623
Her ass, running.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.206
Motherfucker.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.456
Look at her, there she goes.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.540
Again, we cut out the ass,

15:58.542 --> 15:59.581
- what were we doing?
- Yeah.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.831
Who the fuck was filming that?

16:00.833 --> 16:02.206
You know, you probably did it,

16:02.208 --> 16:03.706
because I probably ran, right, right?

16:03.708 --> 16:05.040
Didn't I run right after her?

16:05.042 --> 16:06.540
You probably filmed that.

16:06.542 --> 16:07.998
Look, now I'm looking for her.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.331
Well, you should have told me

16:09.333 --> 16:10.331
you wanted a close up.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.206
Oh, there she is again.

16:12.208 --> 16:13.540
Now she's like, in darkness.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.540
You can barely see.

16:14.542 --> 16:17.331
Yeah. The lighting sucks.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.042
Yo, she is like,

16:20.125 --> 16:21.831
like she's a good actress, but, like,

16:21.833 --> 16:23.917
just as a girl, like,

16:30.917 --> 16:32.540
I look like a priest.

16:32.542 --> 16:34.623
I know, you do.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.540
With the black and the little white.

16:37.250 --> 16:39.248
Totally against who you actually are, though!

16:39.250 --> 16:41.250
Yo, shut up.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.748
It was really cool shooting in the park,

16:44.750 --> 16:46.581
it was a great

16:46.583 --> 16:48.708
great environment.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.540
She has nice hair, too.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.540
Yeah. Everything about her, man.

16:56.542 --> 16:59.123
It matches the trees.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.331
And her shirt is all, like, the top,

17:01.333 --> 17:03.123
Oh, here you come.

17:03.125 --> 17:04.665
Yeah.
There you are, big tough guy.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.623
Ha ha!

17:05.625 --> 17:07.040
What was that?

17:08.333 --> 17:09.540
'Ha ha'!

17:09.541 --> 17:10.580
Yo, motherfucker,

17:10.583 --> 17:12.205
just watch the film, okay,

17:12.208 --> 17:13.330
- just watch the film.
- I am.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.123
I'm watching Courtney especially.

17:16.541 --> 17:18.665
- Best part, uh,
- That's the only thing worth watching.

17:19.791 --> 17:20.830
No it's not!

17:20.833 --> 17:22.830
It's a good film.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.250
And she is good lookin'.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.040
Oof.

17:30.042 --> 17:31.540
What are you zooming into there?

17:31.542 --> 17:32.540
I was zooming in!

17:32.542 --> 17:33.623
I wanted to look!

17:33.625 --> 17:34.915
And that was you, can I,

17:34.917 --> 17:36.042
that was your shot!

17:39.042 --> 17:40.540
You used that cut,

17:40.542 --> 17:42.623
you could've used a different cut!

17:42.625 --> 17:44.540
I bet you, I bet you fucked all of them

17:44.542 --> 17:46.540
up equally.

17:46.542 --> 17:48.414
No I didn't, okay?

17:48.416 --> 17:49.833
Yes you did!

17:51.542 --> 17:52.790
Oh, those eyes.

17:52.792 --> 17:53.706
Mhm.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.540
Nice big eyes.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.542
Nice lips!

17:59.416 --> 18:01.331
Bet those are good for a lot.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.040
Fuckin' asshole.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.540
Can I not imagine?

18:07.542 --> 18:08.998
Can I not dream?

18:09.000 --> 18:09.915
You can!

18:09.917 --> 18:12.540
Who's stopping you?

18:12.542 --> 18:15.540
Go all wild!

18:15.542 --> 18:16.831
It's not like I give a shit!

18:20.917 --> 18:23.414
Imagine, we got like, a nude scene in there?

18:23.416 --> 18:25.250
Yeah.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.915
That's all you got to say?

18:29.917 --> 18:33.540
Well, I'm imagining it, motherfucker!

18:39.542 --> 18:41.706
I wonder if she'd be down for that, like,

18:41.708 --> 18:42.414
Yeah.

18:42.416 --> 18:44.042
I don't know.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.331
Like, with a body like that, I mean,

18:48.333 --> 18:49.331
I don't know.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.540
- How can you not? Like,
- Yeah.

18:50.542 --> 18:51.998
Don't you wanna show that off?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.540
Yeah.

18:53.542 --> 18:54.706
I would.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.583
If I was her.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.706
I'd be lookin' at myself all day long.

19:00.708 --> 19:01.706
Yeah.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.331
She was really cool.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.123
Yeah.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.623
Well, she IS really cool.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.542
Yeah.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.706
Wish we coulda got a kiss scene

19:27.708 --> 19:29.248
in there somewhere.

19:29.250 --> 19:30.915
- Yeah.
- Woulda been awesome.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.540
Well, we coulda gone further.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.623
I wish we had, but, you know?

19:37.625 --> 19:40.333
Only so much you can do.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.248
Yo, man, but I, I have to say,

19:45.250 --> 19:47.581
this is so much better than like,

19:47.583 --> 19:49.915
what the other people are makin' out there.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.331
- I know, like,
- Yeah.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.040
This is a good, like, we did a good job,

19:53.042 --> 19:54.331
I mean, I'll give you that some,

19:54.333 --> 19:55.790
some of it's, like, shaky, blurry,

19:55.792 --> 19:57.456
there's lighting whatever, but,

19:57.458 --> 19:59.540
it's like, a nice environment, and,

19:59.542 --> 20:01.331
- Yeah.
- I don't know, I like the script

20:01.333 --> 20:02.123
and all that, and,

20:02.125 --> 20:04.540
- Yeah.
- That's one of my favorite parts.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.248
I, just the ending overall, I really love.

20:07.250 --> 20:10.123
- And this quote.
- Yep, Martin Luther King!

20:10.125 --> 20:12.540
With your shaky hands in the background!

20:12.542 --> 20:14.790
It's not supposed to be a tripod shot, okay?

20:14.792 --> 20:17.540
Like, it's, it's a handheld shot.

20:17.542 --> 20:20.414
Like, calm down.

20:20.416 --> 20:22.123
Plus, the focus isn't on the sky,

20:22.125 --> 20:23.581
it's on the font.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.540
- Well, not the font, I'm sorry, the text!
- What!

20:25.542 --> 20:27.123
- What the fuck!
- You know what I mean,

20:27.125 --> 20:28.915
there we go, Artifact of a Love,

20:28.917 --> 20:30.540
- there's the title.
- Still hate the font.

20:30.542 --> 20:31.540
Okay, well,

20:31.542 --> 20:33.040
I still love it.

20:33.042 --> 20:34.790
You know, you cold have voiced your opinion

20:34.792 --> 20:36.331
on the font, like, during editing,

20:36.333 --> 20:39.123
it's not like I didn't show you anything.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.123
You didn't give me a choice for font!

20:41.125 --> 20:42.706
You were so adamant on this one!

20:42.708 --> 20:44.831
Because you wanted boring ones!

20:44.833 --> 20:48.540
- Like, you could have picked a different,
- So, what, what's the problem with simplicity?

20:48.542 --> 20:50.414
Because, a simple, you don't want Times,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.123
that's what everybody else does.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.331
Be different.

20:53.333 --> 20:54.915
Yeah, but different doesn't mean

20:54.917 --> 20:56.040
making Sai 'Sal'.

20:57.375 --> 20:58.706
There's a dot above it, okay?

20:58.708 --> 21:00.040
No L has a dot above it,

21:00.042 --> 21:01.623
it's obvious it says Sai.

21:01.625 --> 21:03.540
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.542 --> 21:05.540
Courtney Tane!

21:05.542 --> 21:06.331
Oh yeah.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.708
There she is.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.540
Yeah, there you are.

21:10.542 --> 21:11.581
That says Sai, shut up.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.706
It says Sal, okay?

21:12.708 --> 21:15.331
Shut up.

21:15.333 --> 21:16.706
Like, I get it has a tail,

21:16.708 --> 21:18.540
but that's just cursive.

21:18.542 --> 21:20.915
That's just dumb, is what it is!

21:20.917 --> 21:23.331
Okay, just cause you cant read, like, a

21:23.333 --> 21:26.414
- you know, fancier font, doesn't mean it's bad.
- Oh, just shut up, okay?

21:26.416 --> 21:30.456
It's not a fancy font, it's a dumb font.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.123
No, cause see all those trees in there?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.248
That was all me.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.540
Director of, uh, Cinematography.

21:35.542 --> 21:36.248
Yeah.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.331
That was all me.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.581
All the fuckin'

21:40.583 --> 21:42.623
Stupid shots and lighting that we had,

21:42.625 --> 21:43.581
that was all you!

21:44.583 --> 21:48.331
I'm proud of it, man.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.414
I mean, I, I don't know, I really like the film,

21:50.416 --> 21:51.289
like,

21:51.291 --> 21:52.831
and the music, yeah, the music was a,

21:52.833 --> 21:53.581
like, I felt like

21:53.583 --> 21:55.581
we actually found some pretty good stuff.

21:55.583 --> 21:56.706
Yeah.

21:56.708 --> 21:58.331
I think it fit the tone, and,

21:58.333 --> 21:58.915
Uh huh.

21:58.917 --> 21:59.540
I don't know.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.206
Overall, I mean, I think we actually did

22:01.208 --> 22:01.998
a really good job

22:02.000 --> 22:03.706
with, um,

22:03.708 --> 22:04.540
I don't know.

22:04.542 --> 22:06.331
I mean, we kept it simple, but,

22:06.333 --> 22:08.123
it was interesting, and,

22:08.125 --> 22:09.540
um,

22:09.542 --> 22:11.123
- Eh.
- Like you said, it's better than

22:11.125 --> 22:12.540
what other people are makin', like,

22:12.542 --> 22:15.331
- this is good.
- Yeah.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.790
Like, it has its flaws, but,

22:16.792 --> 22:19.208
so does every other film.

22:28.542 --> 22:29.790
Yo, when the,

22:29.792 --> 22:32.331
- What?
- What the fuck were you thinking when you

22:32.333 --> 22:35.540
It's, yo, that's like, it's true.

22:35.542 --> 22:36.831
The end.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.833
I'm proud of it.

22:58.792 --> 22:59.665
Hey!

22:59.667 --> 23:01.706
I am William Alexander Genovet,

23:01.708 --> 23:03.873
this is actress Courtney Tane,

23:03.875 --> 23:06.164
uh, we are here about to start filming

23:06.166 --> 23:09.040
‘Artifact of a Love’.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.706
There’s Courtney.

23:35.708 --> 23:36.581
There she is.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.581
Um,

23:38.375 --> 23:40.706
she’s signing the release form right now,

23:40.708 --> 23:44.373
just for this, uh, production.

23:44.375 --> 23:46.792
Hi.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.164
How’s it going?

23:53.166 --> 23:54.792
Good.

23:56.000 --> 23:56.915
You uh,

23:56.917 --> 23:57.790
you excited?

23:57.792 --> 23:58.873
Yeah.

23:58.875 --> 24:01.166
Cool.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.456
Look!

25:27.458 --> 25:28.748
We found my dick in the woods

25:28.750 --> 25:30.915
while we were filming.

25:30.917 --> 25:32.040
See?

25:32.042 --> 25:33.623
Had you lost it?

25:33.625 --> 25:34.748
Yeah man, I, uh,

25:34.750 --> 25:36.331
this thing goes all over the place,

25:36.333 --> 25:38.248
you know, sometimes I can’t keep track of it.

25:38.250 --> 25:39.331
it's, you know.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.331
Can we shoot?

25:40.333 --> 25:41.456
We’re shooting right now,

25:41.458 --> 25:42.123
isn’t this,

25:42.125 --> 25:42.957
this counts.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.456
We’ll get to the film, don't worry.

25:44.458 --> 25:46.375
We’ve got plenty of daylight. We're good.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.458
Why, are you not amused?

25:50.959 --> 25:51.915
I think it’s funny.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.706
This is too long to be

25:54.708 --> 25:55.831
your dick, right?

25:55.833 --> 25:57.456
Nah, mine’s longer.

25:57.458 --> 25:58.957
So, we’ve got Courtney here.

25:58.959 --> 25:59.831
She’s uh,

25:59.833 --> 26:02.164
holding my dick on that end.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.248
Smile, smile.

26:05.250 --> 26:06.373
Give a smile.

26:06.375 --> 26:07.373
You’re an actress,

26:07.375 --> 26:08.498
you can do a smile. Smile.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.623
Huh, yeah, there you go,

26:09.625 --> 26:11.706
there you go.

26:11.708 --> 26:13.248
Is it heavy?

26:13.250 --> 26:14.706
Not really.

26:14.708 --> 26:15.831
Whoa!

26:16.625 --> 26:18.456
Yo, don’t, don’t.

26:18.458 --> 26:19.456
This is plenty heavy,

26:19.458 --> 26:21.123
I mean, how, anyway.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.373
You don’t want it too heavy,

26:22.375 --> 26:23.456
or else it can’t get in,

26:23.458 --> 26:24.456
you know what I’m saying?

26:24.458 --> 26:25.456
Are you, are you going?

26:25.458 --> 26:26.040
Yeah.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.040
You’re recording?

26:27.042 --> 26:28.040
Okay, tell, tell them,

26:28.042 --> 26:29.456
tell, say what you were gonna say,

26:29.458 --> 26:31.248
what, what you were saying before.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.748
I have to pee?

26:32.750 --> 26:33.831
Yeah, but,

26:33.833 --> 26:35.831
the, how, with the what, just,

26:35.833 --> 26:36.706
go in the woods,

26:36.708 --> 26:38.331
if you have to pee, go in the woods.

26:38.333 --> 26:39.706
I don’t want to go in the woods!

26:39.708 --> 26:41.456
Well yeah, but the woods are right there

26:41.458 --> 26:43.123
and we, it’s running out of the daylight,

26:43.125 --> 26:44.123
we, just go in the woods,

26:44.125 --> 26:44.915
it’s a lot quicker,

26:44.917 --> 26:45.957
the bathroom is, like,

26:45.959 --> 26:47.373
ten minutes that way.

26:47.375 --> 26:48.957
We’re in a park, here.

26:48.959 --> 26:50.040
Really?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.540
Yeah, just, no one’s gonna see you,

26:51.542 --> 26:53.123
I mean, I, I, I’ve done it,

26:53.125 --> 26:54.456
it’s, you know,

26:54.458 --> 26:55.540
go behind a tree, you pee,

26:55.542 --> 26:56.623
and then you’re done.

26:56.625 --> 26:57.915
It’s a lot quicker, it’s just,

26:57.917 --> 26:59.623
we have to get moving here,

26:59.625 --> 27:01.456
we don’t really have a lot of time.

27:01.458 --> 27:02.748
Just take like two minutes

27:02.750 --> 27:05.331
and then come back.

27:05.333 --> 27:06.540
We won’t look, we’ll just,

27:06.542 --> 27:07.623
we’ll be here, just,

27:07.625 --> 27:09.833
you know, hurry up.

27:13.708 --> 27:15.456
Yo, what are you doin’?

27:15.458 --> 27:16.623
This is her bag, bruh.

27:17.375 --> 27:18.790
Yo, why are you going through it?

27:18.792 --> 27:19.540
She went to pee.

27:20.458 --> 27:22.331
Look, I found a brush.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.706
We can, you wanna clone her?

27:23.708 --> 27:24.498
We can clone her.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.456
Ooh yeah.

27:25.458 --> 27:26.790
We'll have one for each of us?

27:28.042 --> 27:30.250
Yo, I’mma save it for later.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.623
What else is in there?

27:33.625 --> 27:34.456
We got,

27:34.458 --> 27:35.831
ooh, we got money!

27:35.833 --> 27:37.040
Ooh, how much?

27:37.042 --> 27:38.456
We got a rich one!

27:38.458 --> 27:39.456
Uh, let’s see.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.540
We got some dimes.

27:40.542 --> 27:41.456
I like the dimes.

27:41.458 --> 27:42.957
The dimes are small.

27:42.959 --> 27:44.456
You want the, I don't want a penny,

27:44.458 --> 27:45.706
- do you want a penny?
- Nah, man.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.456
- You want a penny?
- Who wants a penny?

27:47.458 --> 27:49.458
Don’t throw it at me!

27:51.250 --> 27:52.373
Dude, she’s taking a while

27:52.375 --> 27:55.040
over there too.

27:55.042 --> 27:56.040
Dude, look at that!

27:56.042 --> 27:56.831
Is that her pee?

27:56.833 --> 27:58.540
Yeah. I think it is.

27:58.542 --> 27:59.915
It goes all the way from here

27:59.917 --> 28:00.831
over to there.

28:02.833 --> 28:04.373
Do girls pee this much, dude?

28:04.375 --> 28:05.164
Like,

28:05.166 --> 28:06.456
Dude, I have no idea.

28:06.458 --> 28:07.957
Yeah, I don’t pee this much, damn,

28:07.959 --> 28:10.040
- what does she drink?
- I have never seen this, dude.

28:11.375 --> 28:12.748
Get a shot, get a shot of like,

28:12.750 --> 28:14.456
dude, like, it’s like,

28:14.458 --> 28:16.456
saturated over here though.

28:16.458 --> 28:17.957
Like, that’s not just a little bit.

28:17.959 --> 28:19.331
Can we go?

28:19.333 --> 28:20.831
What are you drinking, dude?

28:20.833 --> 28:22.456
You said you were in a rush to film,

28:22.458 --> 28:23.748
why aren’t we filming?

28:23.750 --> 28:24.831
Well, because, I mean,

28:24.833 --> 28:25.748
we don’t really,

28:25.750 --> 28:27.040
we’re just looking at the pee,

28:27.042 --> 28:28.456
I don’t know, I mean, it’s funny.

28:28.458 --> 28:30.456
It’s like, behind the scenes stuff.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.456
I don’t want this on camera.

28:32.458 --> 28:34.040
Well, I mean, you did in the woods,

28:34.042 --> 28:35.456
- anybody can see it, I mean.
- Mm.

28:35.458 --> 28:37.540
So, Courtney is

28:37.542 --> 28:39.540
a little bit thirsty, she says, uh,

28:39.542 --> 28:40.248
Yep.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.248
She wants a drink, um,

28:41.250 --> 28:42.456
and we found this tree here

28:42.458 --> 28:45.040
that she claims she can climb,

28:45.042 --> 28:47.456
so, uh, we made a deal that

28:47.458 --> 28:49.623
if you can climb this tree successfully,

28:49.625 --> 28:51.498
and, we’ll determine what’s successful,

28:51.500 --> 28:53.706
uh, then we will buy you a water.

28:53.708 --> 28:54.750
- Yeah.
- Or, you know,

28:54.833 --> 28:58.123
maybe an iced tea or something, but, uh,

28:58.125 --> 28:59.248
Water’s good.

28:59.250 --> 29:00.164
Yeah.

29:00.166 --> 29:01.456
Get climbing!

29:01.458 --> 29:03.748
Okay.

29:03.750 --> 29:05.373
There she goes.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.456
Oh, there, oh!

29:08.458 --> 29:10.123
Skill, it looks like you’re gonna have to

29:10.125 --> 29:11.248
buy the water.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.456
Hang on, hang on.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.458
You never know.

29:16.625 --> 29:19.456
- I’m not actually buyin’ this girl a water.
- This high enough?

29:19.458 --> 29:22.248
No, you gotta keep goin’.

29:22.250 --> 29:23.456
You have to go the top.

29:23.458 --> 29:24.040
Yeah.

29:24.042 --> 29:24.623
The top?

29:24.625 --> 29:26.331
Yeah.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.166
Uh.

29:29.708 --> 29:32.456
Definitely the top, keep going.

29:32.458 --> 29:33.706
It’s a tall tree.

29:33.708 --> 29:35.456
Yeah, well, that’s no excuse,

29:35.458 --> 29:36.540
you don’t get the water,

29:36.542 --> 29:37.831
you didn’t make it to the top.

29:37.833 --> 29:39.456
- Are you kidding?
- She chickened out.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.123
I told you, you had to get to the top,

29:41.125 --> 29:42.248
does that look like the top,

29:42.250 --> 29:43.498
or does that look like the top?

29:43.500 --> 29:44.164
No.

29:44.166 --> 29:45.164
Yup. No water for you.

29:45.166 --> 29:46.831
Doesn’t look like the top to me, dude.

29:47.959 --> 29:48.498
You good?

29:48.500 --> 29:49.540
Can you help me?

29:49.542 --> 29:50.706
You can get down,

29:50.708 --> 29:53.040
you got up, don’t.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.456
There she is.

29:54.458 --> 29:55.915
Yay.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.456
Still thirsty?

29:59.458 --> 30:00.498
Yes.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.456
Yo!

30:01.458 --> 30:02.456
Squirrel!

30:03.250 --> 30:05.040
Wait, don’t scare it, don’t scare it.

30:05.042 --> 30:05.748
Leave it alone!

30:05.750 --> 30:06.498
Come here!

30:06.500 --> 30:09.164
That’s not nice!

30:09.166 --> 30:10.831
Where’s it goin’? Where’s it goin’?

30:10.833 --> 30:12.498
- If you’re cold,
- Can we go inside soon?

30:12.500 --> 30:13.456
If you’re cold,

30:13.458 --> 30:15.456
the best thing to do is jumping jacks, you know?

30:15.458 --> 30:16.040
Yeah.

30:16.042 --> 30:18.831
Warms you right up.

30:18.833 --> 30:19.706
- Go for it.
- Yep.

30:19.708 --> 30:20.706
Do some jumping jacks.

30:20.708 --> 30:22.458
Come on. Do ten.

30:28.166 --> 30:29.456
Mhm.

30:29.458 --> 30:32.456
Do fifteen. Fifteen.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.456
Or twenty.

30:33.458 --> 30:35.123
Fifty will get you really warm.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.456
Yeah, no, if you wanna be like,

30:36.458 --> 30:37.456
That was fifteen.

30:37.458 --> 30:39.456
If you want to be hot, you know,

30:39.458 --> 30:40.456
- Yeah.
- Hot, you know?

30:40.458 --> 30:41.123
- Yeah.
- Uh,

30:41.125 --> 30:41.665
A hundred.

30:41.667 --> 30:42.623
Just go up to, like,

30:42.625 --> 30:43.456
yeah, a hundred, or,

30:43.458 --> 30:44.706
a hundred seventy five, even.

30:44.708 --> 30:45.456
Yeah.

30:45.458 --> 30:46.790
Just, just keep going until they,

30:47.542 --> 30:49.625
like, just keep going.

30:50.708 --> 30:51.623
Is this what you want?

30:51.625 --> 30:53.456
Yes! Come on, I need to go home!

30:54.542 --> 30:55.831
Come on!

30:55.833 --> 30:57.623
- Take your bag! Take your bag!
- I gotta go!

30:57.625 --> 30:59.456
Don’t! Don’t!

30:59.458 --> 31:01.373
Oh shit!

31:01.375 --> 31:02.040
You’re leaving?

31:02.042 --> 31:03.540
Yeah, where are you going?

31:03.542 --> 31:06.498
Don’t, we, we still have another take.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.040
We have a few more shots to do,

31:08.042 --> 31:09.706
where are you heading off to?

31:09.708 --> 31:12.456
The film isn’t done yet!

31:12.458 --> 31:14.831
We’ll, we'll cast someone else!

31:14.833 --> 31:16.331
You messed a couple scenes,

31:16.333 --> 31:18.623
we gotta actually reshot the whole thing.

31:18.625 --> 31:19.706
Or reshoot.

31:19.708 --> 31:21.498
We gotta reshoot the whole thing.

31:21.500 --> 31:23.623
Yo, so, we found,

31:23.625 --> 31:25.456
we found Courtney’s vagina over here.

31:25.458 --> 31:26.456
Yo, look at this.

31:27.458 --> 31:28.498
It looks a little dry.

31:28.500 --> 31:29.915
- Yeah.
- Ain’t lookin’ too good.

31:29.917 --> 31:32.164
We got, what is this?

31:32.166 --> 31:34.456
- Yo, what, what, what’s it doin’?
- Who’s dick is that?

31:34.458 --> 31:35.456
Whose is that?

31:35.458 --> 31:37.248
You know, that ain’t long enough to be mine.

31:37.250 --> 31:38.331
It’s not mine either.

31:38.333 --> 31:39.456
Oh.

31:39.458 --> 31:40.456
Yeah, yup.

31:40.458 --> 31:41.456
She’s one of those.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.498
Damn.

31:45.500 --> 31:46.540
Yeah, she could use some,

31:46.542 --> 31:47.456
what is it, yogurt?

31:47.458 --> 31:49.123
- Mhm?
- They use yogurt down there?

31:49.125 --> 31:50.456
I, I have no idea dude.

31:51.917 --> 31:53.456
Ain’t lookin’ too moist.

31:53.458 --> 31:54.248
Yeah.

31:55.125 --> 31:57.373
Yo, don’t be kickin' it my way.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.248
I don’t want that.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.082
I’m putting it in.

31:59.833 --> 32:01.040
It’s already in there, dudes.

32:01.042 --> 32:02.623
Tight as hell.

32:02.625 --> 32:03.623
It can go further.

32:45.416 --> 32:47.289
Hi, I am William,

32:47.291 --> 32:49.208
and I made 'Artifact of a Love'.

32:51.084 --> 32:53.498
So, Sai came to me, uh,

32:53.500 --> 32:56.414
with an idea for this big sort of

32:56.416 --> 32:58.790
massive sci-fi film that, um,

32:58.792 --> 33:00.206
just, budget-wise, uh,

33:00.208 --> 33:01.414
we couldn't really make.

33:01.416 --> 33:03.123
Uh, it was a little bit out of our hands,

33:03.125 --> 33:04.915
so we figured we'll take a piece of it from,

33:04.917 --> 33:05.581
from the end,

33:05.583 --> 33:07.414
and sort of just focus on that and make that

33:07.416 --> 33:09.123
into more of a short film, uh,

33:09.125 --> 33:11.581
which became 'Artfiact of a Love', and um,

33:11.583 --> 33:13.581
yeah, we're, we're, I mean, we're in love with it,

33:13.583 --> 33:15.915
we're, we, it's a really good film, um,

33:15.917 --> 33:17.581
we like it.

33:17.583 --> 33:20.456
Yeah, I've always been interested in making films

33:20.458 --> 33:22.665
and directing, uh, people, and,

33:22.667 --> 33:24.581
um, it's always been a passion of mine,

33:24.583 --> 33:26.206
it's always been a dream of mine,

33:26.208 --> 33:28.289
um, it's still a dream of mine to

33:28.291 --> 33:30.790
eventually be able to make bigger projects,

33:30.792 --> 33:32.706
maybe one day we can make something,

33:32.708 --> 33:35.456
uh, to the scale that Sai, um,

33:35.458 --> 33:38.581
you know, that his original idea was, um,

33:38.583 --> 33:40.289
so, hopefully we get there, but,

33:40.291 --> 33:41.414
I mean, even for right now,

33:41.416 --> 33:42.790
just to be able to make the films

33:42.792 --> 33:44.082
that we're making is,

33:44.084 --> 33:47.206
uh, it's an honor, it's a dream, um,

33:47.208 --> 33:49.206
since I was a kid I've always wanted

33:49.208 --> 33:50.206
to do this, and,

33:50.208 --> 33:51.790
here we are.

33:51.792 --> 33:54.414
I put out a casting call, um,

33:54.416 --> 33:56.581
to obviously cast people for the film,

33:56.583 --> 33:58.414
um, we got submissions from,

33:58.416 --> 34:00.331
you know, all over the country, and,

34:00.333 --> 34:02.915
um, Courtney was in New York City,

34:02.917 --> 34:05.123
and she had the best tape,

34:05.125 --> 34:06.581
um, so,

34:06.583 --> 34:08.790
she was clearly the choice for us,

34:08.792 --> 34:09.998
we knew, uh,

34:10.000 --> 34:11.414
the second that we saw the tape,

34:11.416 --> 34:12.540
and that she was so close,

34:12.542 --> 34:13.873
it would, it would be convenient,

34:13.875 --> 34:15.540
and we'd get a great performance from her

34:15.542 --> 34:17.790
and we did, she uh, knocked it outta the park.

34:17.792 --> 34:19.414
Courtney was, um,

34:19.416 --> 34:21.414
or is, a very talented actress,

34:21.416 --> 34:22.998
and, uh, just, as a person,

34:23.000 --> 34:24.456
she was great to have on set,

34:24.458 --> 34:25.998
and wonderful to work with,

34:26.000 --> 34:27.206
um,

34:27.208 --> 34:28.665
you know, I feel like its important

34:28.667 --> 34:31.414
as a director to, um,

34:31.416 --> 34:33.123
take care of your cast, and,

34:33.125 --> 34:34.414
your crew, and, whoever works

34:34.416 --> 34:35.581
on your films, and,

34:35.583 --> 34:36.998
to make them feel comfortable

34:37.000 --> 34:38.414
and appreciated, and,

34:38.416 --> 34:40.206
uh, Courtney felt very

34:40.208 --> 34:42.414
you know, um, respected, and,

34:42.416 --> 34:44.581
uh, very comfortable on set, um,

34:44.583 --> 34:46.498
that was very important for me, um,

34:46.500 --> 34:48.581
you know, being in control of everybody,

34:48.583 --> 34:50.289
making sure that the environment,

34:50.291 --> 34:52.790
uh, was one that you would like to work in,

34:52.792 --> 34:55.498
um, I think I accomplished that, and um,

34:55.500 --> 34:58.414
yeah, I mean, she did great, and uh,

34:58.416 --> 35:01.414
she is a very talented and great person.

35:01.416 --> 35:03.581
The film, to me,

35:03.583 --> 35:05.790
it deals very heavily with, um,

35:05.792 --> 35:07.331
themes that are important

35:07.333 --> 35:08.915
in my own life, um,

35:08.917 --> 35:10.414
there's, you know, love,

35:10.416 --> 35:11.790
there's, uh, death,

35:11.792 --> 35:13.915
there's, just, several aspects

35:13.917 --> 35:15.206
of this film that,

35:15.208 --> 35:17.123
uh, really came from my heart,

35:17.125 --> 35:18.581
um, they were very meaningful to me,

35:18.583 --> 35:19.998
and, and, I mean, I think that's

35:20.000 --> 35:21.414
what I do as a filmmaker,

35:21.416 --> 35:22.998
that's what all filmmakers do is they

35:23.000 --> 35:24.082
explore themes that

35:24.084 --> 35:25.581
are very personal to them,

35:25.583 --> 35:28.331
this was no exception, um,

35:28.333 --> 35:30.206
and, yeah, uh, it,

35:30.208 --> 35:31.790
it was sort of an opportunity for me

35:31.792 --> 35:33.706
to take moments from my own life

35:33.708 --> 35:35.915
that have been gnawing away at me, or,

35:35.917 --> 35:37.706
or whatever and just take my own experiences

35:37.708 --> 35:39.498
and pour them into a work of art

35:39.500 --> 35:41.915
that I can share with other people, and, um,

35:41.917 --> 35:43.414
that's one of the best parts

35:43.416 --> 35:45.123
of the whole process.

35:45.125 --> 35:47.331
Uh, my influences, um,

35:47.333 --> 35:48.706
the people that I look up to, uh,

35:48.708 --> 35:50.414
Stephen Spielberg, David Lynch,

35:50.416 --> 35:51.456
he's a great one,

35:51.458 --> 35:52.498
um,

35:52.500 --> 35:54.998
hopefully one day, um,

35:55.000 --> 35:56.915
you know, I can, make,

35:56.917 --> 35:59.665
a production to the scale of what they do,

35:59.667 --> 36:01.414
I think they do great work,

36:01.416 --> 36:03.331
um, they're huge inspirations to me,

36:03.333 --> 36:05.414
both, you know, directing, and,

36:05.416 --> 36:07.206
and just the stories that they tell,

36:07.208 --> 36:08.456
I hope to be able to,

36:08.458 --> 36:09.790
to tell one day,

36:09.792 --> 36:11.581
um, to the extent that they do,

36:11.583 --> 36:13.498
and to really be able to dive deep

36:13.500 --> 36:16.414
into, a, um, production like that

36:16.416 --> 36:18.206
without any limitations,

36:18.208 --> 36:20.414
uh, that's really what's best for this story,

36:20.416 --> 36:21.915
and I can't wait for the day that

36:21.917 --> 36:23.498
I'm actually able to accomplish that,

36:23.500 --> 36:24.414
it's gonna,

36:24.416 --> 36:26.206
it's gonna be fun.

36:26.208 --> 36:28.581
Hopefully, uh, in the future, um,

36:28.583 --> 36:30.414
we can make,

36:30.416 --> 36:32.414
uh, that sci-fi film that

36:32.416 --> 36:33.915
Sai brought to me,

36:33.917 --> 36:35.414
uh, it was about, like,

36:35.416 --> 36:36.414
200 pages long,

36:36.416 --> 36:38.665
um, and it's really ambitious,

36:38.667 --> 36:40.456
uh, that's what I hope to be able

36:40.458 --> 36:42.289
to achieve, it was a really great story,

36:42.291 --> 36:43.414
and I hope that,

36:43.416 --> 36:44.665
that we can expand on it, and,

36:44.667 --> 36:45.915
just really kill it,

36:45.917 --> 36:47.790
um, even if it's, I mean,

36:47.792 --> 36:49.206
if, if, you know,

36:49.208 --> 36:50.998
maybe in the form of a comic book even,

36:51.000 --> 36:52.456
um, but, uh,

36:52.458 --> 36:53.665
I mean, first and foremost,

36:53.667 --> 36:54.665
I like telling stories,

36:54.667 --> 36:56.414
and I want to get that story out there,

36:56.416 --> 36:57.748
and I wanna get a bunch of other

36:57.750 --> 36:59.665
stories out there, um, and, so,

36:59.667 --> 37:01.414
that's, that's what I'm looking to do

37:01.416 --> 37:02.581
in the future, and, uh,

37:02.583 --> 37:04.331
I think it's gonna be really great,

37:04.333 --> 37:05.998
uh, I think people are really gonna like

37:06.000 --> 37:07.581
what I do next, what we do next,

37:07.583 --> 37:08.998
and um,

37:09.000 --> 37:10.206
I'm very excited.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.581
I can't wait.

37:11.583 --> 37:14.414
My advice for any aspiring filmmakers,

37:14.416 --> 37:16.206
anyone just starting out,

37:16.208 --> 37:18.082
um,

37:18.084 --> 37:19.414
first of all, you have to know

37:19.416 --> 37:20.581
what you want, that's,

37:20.583 --> 37:22.414
that's key, you have to

37:22.416 --> 37:23.581
have a goal in mind,

37:23.583 --> 37:25.082
and as long as you set your mind

37:25.084 --> 37:25.915
to that goal,

37:25.917 --> 37:27.414
you will be able to accomplish it,

37:27.416 --> 37:28.790
um,

37:28.792 --> 37:29.790
of course, to do that,

37:29.792 --> 37:31.331
you need people, you need a crew,

37:31.333 --> 37:32.790
you need a cast, and, so,

37:32.792 --> 37:35.082
always be respectful

37:35.084 --> 37:36.414
to people, and, and,

37:36.416 --> 37:38.414
be a guy that people would want to work with.

37:38.416 --> 37:39.665
Uh, you have to take your role

37:39.667 --> 37:41.414
seriously, and, if you, if you don't,

37:41.416 --> 37:42.540
then, nobody is gonna wanna

37:42.542 --> 37:43.706
work on your projects and

37:43.708 --> 37:44.998
nothing is going to get made

37:45.000 --> 37:46.414
because you can't do

37:46.416 --> 37:48.206
everything by yourself, so,

37:48.208 --> 37:49.414
um, I say

37:49.416 --> 37:50.790
have a goal in mind,

37:50.792 --> 37:52.414
set a date for yourself,

37:52.416 --> 37:53.414
I wanna have this made

37:53.416 --> 37:54.706
by this date, or,

37:54.708 --> 37:56.414
um, just, just know,

37:56.416 --> 37:57.873
you know, what you want to make,

37:57.875 --> 37:59.414
have a vision, and,

37:59.416 --> 38:01.206
go out and, and make that vision,

38:01.208 --> 38:02.414
and have a group of people

38:02.416 --> 38:03.790
that you can trust, and, and,

38:03.792 --> 38:04.790
that they can trust you

38:04.792 --> 38:06.414
is really important, and,

38:06.416 --> 38:08.416
just make cool things together.

38:16.416 --> 38:17.957
Hi, I'm Sai,

38:17.959 --> 38:20.831
and I made 'Artifact of Love' with William.

38:20.833 --> 38:22.540
I had this, um,

38:22.542 --> 38:24.373
crazy idea to do a

38:24.375 --> 38:25.831
sci-fi,

38:25.833 --> 38:27.623
um, like, it was, it was gonna be a whole

38:27.625 --> 38:30.164
three-part franchise and stuff, but,

38:30.166 --> 38:33.164
um, didn't have the money to make it,

38:33.166 --> 38:34.373
so,

38:34.375 --> 38:36.748
I, I pitched the idea to William, and like,

38:36.750 --> 38:38.414
you know, we decided to

38:38.416 --> 38:39.957
just take the last part,

38:39.959 --> 38:41.623
make a whole film out of that,

38:41.625 --> 38:45.373
and that's how 'Artifact of Love' came to be.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.248
So, I've known William since, you know,

38:47.250 --> 38:48.456
we were in elementary school,

38:48.458 --> 38:50.164
um,

38:50.166 --> 38:52.414
we basically grew up watching movies together,

38:52.416 --> 38:53.831
we'd go,

38:53.833 --> 38:55.873
um, almost every weekend

38:55.875 --> 38:58.373
to the cinemas, watch something or the other,

38:58.375 --> 39:00.289
um, and if we couldn't go out,

39:00.291 --> 39:01.748
we'd just be at home, um,

39:01.750 --> 39:03.957
you know on, on TV or whatever,

39:03.959 --> 39:05.373
um,

39:05.375 --> 39:06.831
yeah, so, you know, we, we

39:06.833 --> 39:08.164
have similar taste in movies,

39:08.166 --> 39:10.373
we always wanted to make movies together,

39:10.375 --> 39:11.414
and,

39:11.416 --> 39:14.164
I guess here we are, doing that now.

39:14.166 --> 39:16.248
Um, a little bit about William,

39:16.250 --> 39:17.831
he's, um,

39:17.833 --> 39:19.623
well, what can I say,

39:19.625 --> 39:23.164
he's literally among the best directors I know,

39:23.166 --> 39:24.373
um,

39:24.375 --> 39:26.665
he has such a keen eye for talent,

39:26.667 --> 39:29.748
um, like,

39:29.750 --> 39:31.957
I, I, I don't think anyone else

39:31.959 --> 39:34.164
does casting better than he does,

39:34.166 --> 39:36.373
he knows exactly who to work with,

39:36.375 --> 39:38.040
how to work with them,

39:38.042 --> 39:39.248
um,

39:39.250 --> 39:41.414
and even all the other technical stuff,

39:41.416 --> 39:43.373
you know, like, he, he even does

39:43.375 --> 39:44.623
the costumes himself,

39:44.625 --> 39:45.623
he even

39:45.625 --> 39:48.289
does the cinematography himself,

39:48.291 --> 39:49.373
you know, he's,

39:49.375 --> 39:50.373
he's all in,

39:50.375 --> 39:51.289
um,

39:51.291 --> 39:53.289
and that's just amazing about him,

39:53.291 --> 39:55.373
the eye that he has for perfection

39:55.375 --> 39:56.540
and detail,

39:56.542 --> 39:59.373
um, he, he genuinely knows,

39:59.375 --> 40:02.289
um, the entire craft of filmmaking,

40:02.291 --> 40:05.289
and he's really good at what he does.

40:05.291 --> 40:08.040
So, how we find Courtney,

40:08.042 --> 40:11.373
um, William put out a casting call,

40:11.375 --> 40:15.665
um, for the female lead for this film,

40:15.667 --> 40:18.540
um, and we got, we got a bunch of replies,

40:18.542 --> 40:21.373
um, from all over the country, and,

40:21.375 --> 40:23.748
uh, Courtney was by far, um,

40:23.750 --> 40:27.040
the best, um, audition that we saw,

40:27.042 --> 40:29.748
um, she nailed the character completely,

40:29.750 --> 40:31.957
her understanding of the depth of the character

40:31.959 --> 40:33.581
and like, you know, the layers that she

40:33.583 --> 40:36.540
brought out were just superb,

40:36.542 --> 40:39.623
um, yeah, and like, she was so professional,

40:39.625 --> 40:41.540
timely, um,

40:41.542 --> 40:43.373
always, always, um,

40:43.375 --> 40:45.164
a joy to work with,

40:45.166 --> 40:46.957
and, you know,

40:46.959 --> 40:48.373
I'm, I'm so glad that, you know,

40:48.375 --> 40:50.373
we were able to find her and work with her,

40:50.375 --> 40:52.082
because I don't think anyone else

40:52.084 --> 40:54.959
coulda done the character better than she did.

40:56.291 --> 40:58.373
Um, so, what does film mean to me,

40:58.375 --> 41:01.373
film is, um,

41:01.375 --> 41:02.748
you know, it's, it's,

41:02.750 --> 41:04.373
really touching to me

41:04.375 --> 41:06.456
and I feel very passionate about it,

41:06.458 --> 41:07.957
I think it's a great way to

41:07.959 --> 41:09.248
communicate with people,

41:09.250 --> 41:12.040
to share ideas, to,

41:12.042 --> 41:13.665
um, you know, express yourself

41:13.667 --> 41:16.082
and bring out who you really are,

41:16.084 --> 41:19.082
um, and share things with people that,

41:19.084 --> 41:20.373
you know, um,

41:20.375 --> 41:23.456
they need to know, that, you know, um,

41:23.458 --> 41:24.665
it's, it's a way to

41:24.667 --> 41:25.414
get out to people,

41:25.416 --> 41:27.373
it's also a way to just get entertained,

41:27.375 --> 41:28.748
you know, like,

41:28.750 --> 41:30.831
who doesn't like spending a Friday night

41:30.833 --> 41:32.373
at the cinemas, and just, you know,

41:32.375 --> 41:33.831
seeing a fun film,

41:33.833 --> 41:36.373
and, that's, that's sort of where I come,

41:36.375 --> 41:38.248
um, yeah, where, where I come from,

41:38.250 --> 41:40.248
um,

41:40.250 --> 41:41.373
yeah, I, I just,

41:41.375 --> 41:43.540
you know, film means to,

41:43.542 --> 41:45.164
film means the world to me,

41:45.166 --> 41:46.456
um,

41:46.458 --> 41:50.289
cause I think you can do a lot with it.

41:50.291 --> 41:51.748
The filmmakers,

41:51.750 --> 41:53.373
you know, that I've learned a lot from,

41:53.375 --> 41:54.373
and like, you know, I,

41:54.375 --> 41:55.665
I aspire to be like,

41:55.667 --> 41:56.873
um,

41:56.875 --> 41:58.831
you know, the, the main

41:58.833 --> 42:00.540
content that's really moved me,

42:00.542 --> 42:01.540
and like, you know, I,

42:01.542 --> 42:03.164
I aspire to be like that,

42:03.166 --> 42:05.164
you know, you have,

42:05.166 --> 42:06.748
the Christopher Nolan,

42:06.750 --> 42:07.873
you have Danny Boyle,

42:07.875 --> 42:10.164
you have Martin Scorsese,

42:10.166 --> 42:12.040
you know, these are the kind of filmmakers

42:12.042 --> 42:12.957
I want to be like,

42:12.959 --> 42:14.748
you know, I, I look up to them,

42:14.750 --> 42:15.748
and,

42:15.750 --> 42:17.373
I hope that one day

42:17.375 --> 42:20.164
I can make, um, you know,

42:20.166 --> 42:21.748
the sort of impact on cinema

42:21.750 --> 42:23.040
that they've had,

42:23.042 --> 42:25.373
um, and, you know, just,

42:25.375 --> 42:26.373
sort of,

42:26.375 --> 42:28.373
emulate their style, and, you know,

42:28.375 --> 42:30.540
their stature.

42:30.542 --> 42:32.414
So, I'm, I'm currently working on,

42:32.416 --> 42:36.373
um, a screenplay, it's, it's pretty long,

42:36.375 --> 42:39.082
um, yeah, I've, going, touching the

42:39.084 --> 42:40.373
two or three hour mark,

42:40.375 --> 42:42.164
um,

42:42.166 --> 42:44.164
and yeah, there, there's a few other,

42:44.166 --> 42:45.373
um,

42:45.375 --> 42:47.082
projects in the pipeline,

42:47.084 --> 42:48.164
a few of them, you know,

42:48.166 --> 42:50.748
waiting to be greenlit and stuff, and so,

42:50.750 --> 42:54.289
um, yeah, it's pretty exciting.

42:54.291 --> 42:58.373
Um, so, advice for aspiring filmmakers, um,

42:58.375 --> 43:00.540
well, you know, just, just be truthful,

43:00.542 --> 43:02.164
um, be who you are,

43:02.166 --> 43:04.373
make, um,

43:04.375 --> 43:06.164
films that mean a lot to you,

43:06.166 --> 43:07.623
um,

43:07.625 --> 43:10.040
and, you know, try and see if you can work with

43:10.042 --> 43:11.414
the best people,

43:11.416 --> 43:12.831
um, because they always bring

43:12.833 --> 43:14.248
the best to the table,

43:14.250 --> 43:15.373
um,

43:15.375 --> 43:16.665
and yeah, that, that's about it,

43:16.667 --> 43:18.373
just try and be yourself,

43:18.375 --> 43:20.289
express yourself, and,

43:20.291 --> 43:21.959
um, yeah, you'll get there.

43:43.125 --> 43:44.873
Hi, my name is Rachel Elstein,

43:44.875 --> 43:47.833
and I’m reading for the role of Angela Summering.

43:50.084 --> 43:52.706
Because you love yourself. You do.

43:52.708 --> 43:54.414
I always believed it.

43:54.416 --> 43:55.831
Even if you didn’t.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.831
Even when we were on the run.

43:57.833 --> 43:59.289
Avoiding the gangs.

43:59.291 --> 44:00.998
Avoiding my father.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.831
Even when you used to stay up all night

44:02.833 --> 44:04.623
saying you wanted to commit suicide

44:04.625 --> 44:06.748
for all the people you kill.

44:06.750 --> 44:08.831
And you’d drink. And you’d hit me.

44:08.833 --> 44:10.498
And I’d hit you.

44:10.500 --> 44:12.082
And you’d drink some more.

44:12.084 --> 44:13.831
And you’d go out and kill.

44:13.833 --> 44:15.706
Just so we could have money.

44:15.708 --> 44:17.831
Still do contract killing jobs,

44:17.833 --> 44:19.414
just for me.

44:19.416 --> 44:21.540
Freelance contract killing jobs,

44:21.542 --> 44:22.998
for me.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.416
For us.

44:35.166 --> 44:36.706
So, she,

44:36.708 --> 44:38.289
yeah, she wasn't right,

44:38.291 --> 44:39.790
uh, she was

44:39.792 --> 44:41.790
a little bit too fat, um,

44:41.792 --> 44:44.040
skin just wasn't really,

44:44.042 --> 44:46.498
uh, didn't have that actress look,

44:46.500 --> 44:48.790
um, didn't look the part at all,

44:48.792 --> 44:51.581
she's delivering the lines wrong,

44:51.583 --> 44:53.498
got the tone completely off,

44:53.500 --> 44:56.164
it's a dramatic role, a serious role,

44:56.166 --> 44:58.164
and she's just not getting into

44:58.166 --> 45:00.248
that headspace, and, uh,

45:00.250 --> 45:01.790
I could tell that there, there was,

45:01.792 --> 45:03.040
there was nothing you could do

45:03.042 --> 45:04.790
to fix this, uh, this was

45:04.792 --> 45:06.790
a lost cause right here, so,

45:06.792 --> 45:10.164
um, definitely not for this film,

45:10.166 --> 45:12.706
or most films,

45:12.708 --> 45:14.456
um, yeah, the she,

45:14.458 --> 45:15.959
this one missed the mark.

45:26.250 --> 45:28.248
Hi! My name is Gwen Gilbert,

45:28.250 --> 45:30.123
and I will be reading for the part of

45:30.125 --> 45:32.208
Angela Summering.

45:35.000 --> 45:38.123
Because you love yourself. You do.

45:38.125 --> 45:40.540
I always believed it.

45:40.542 --> 45:42.331
Even if you didn’t.

45:42.333 --> 45:43.998
Even when we were on the run and

45:44.000 --> 45:45.331
avoiding the gangs.

45:45.333 --> 45:47.206
Avoiding my father.

45:47.208 --> 45:49.248
Even when you used to stay up all night

45:49.250 --> 45:51.206
saying you wanted to commit suicide

45:51.208 --> 45:53.915
for all the people you’ve killed.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.665
And you’d drink, and then you’d hit me,

45:56.667 --> 45:57.998
and I’d hit you

45:58.000 --> 46:00.125
and then you’d drink some more.

46:00.917 --> 46:03.123
And then you’d go out and kill.

46:03.125 --> 46:05.665
Just so we could have money.

46:05.667 --> 46:07.540
Still do contract killing jobs,

46:07.542 --> 46:08.998
just for me.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.831
Freelance contract killing jobs,

46:10.833 --> 46:12.748
for me.

46:12.750 --> 46:15.540
For us.

46:15.542 --> 46:17.000
Thank you!

46:25.959 --> 46:27.748
So, uh, this one was great,

46:27.750 --> 46:29.289
um, woulda been awesome to have

46:29.291 --> 46:30.164
her in the film,

46:30.166 --> 46:31.706
problem was she was on the west coast,

46:31.708 --> 46:33.790
and just to get her out here

46:33.792 --> 46:35.748
would've been, um,

46:35.750 --> 46:37.581
it woulda cost money, and it,

46:37.583 --> 46:38.706
it woulda been inconvenient,

46:38.708 --> 46:40.289
and it just wouldn't work out,

46:40.291 --> 46:41.998
uh, which is really unfortunate cause

46:42.000 --> 46:43.706
she was really talented,

46:43.708 --> 46:45.289
and really hot,

46:45.291 --> 46:47.498
uh, it woulda been great to have her, um,

46:47.500 --> 46:49.414
hopefully in the future

46:49.416 --> 46:51.082
we can maybe fly her out,

46:51.084 --> 46:52.289
or figure out something,

46:52.291 --> 46:53.706
get an arrangement going to where

46:53.708 --> 46:54.706
we could work on her,

46:54.708 --> 46:55.873
uh, with her on something,

46:55.875 --> 46:58.164
because, yeah, she is,

46:58.166 --> 47:00.206
she's too hot, too hot to pass on,

47:00.208 --> 47:01.706
she is, uh,

47:01.708 --> 47:02.790
uh, easy on the eyes,

47:02.792 --> 47:04.873
which is what you want in an actress, and,

47:04.875 --> 47:06.498
she was also really talented, so,

47:06.500 --> 47:08.164
it was a shame it didn't work this time,

47:08.166 --> 47:10.082
but, uh, you know, who knows,

47:10.084 --> 47:11.708
hopefully in the future.

47:24.125 --> 47:26.040
Hi. I'm Cara McInnes,

47:26.042 --> 47:27.915
and I’m reading for the role

47:27.917 --> 47:30.456
of Angela Summering.

47:30.458 --> 47:32.831
Because you love yourself.

47:32.833 --> 47:34.665
You do!

47:34.667 --> 47:36.748
I always believed it.

47:36.750 --> 47:38.998
Even if you didn’t.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.123
Even when we were on the run,

47:41.125 --> 47:43.331
avoiding the gangs,

47:43.333 --> 47:46.123
avoiding my father.

47:46.125 --> 47:48.915
Even when you used to stay up all night

47:48.917 --> 47:51.331
saying that you wanted to commit suicide

47:51.333 --> 47:54.248
for all the people you’d killed.

47:54.250 --> 47:56.540
And you’d drink.

47:56.542 --> 47:59.748
And, you’d hit me.

47:59.750 --> 48:02.623
And I’d hit you.

48:02.625 --> 48:05.456
And you’d drink some more.

48:05.458 --> 48:08.623
And then you’d go out and kill.

48:08.625 --> 48:11.790
Just so we could have some money.

48:11.792 --> 48:14.206
Still do contract killing jobs,

48:14.208 --> 48:16.414
just for me.

48:16.416 --> 48:20.206
Freelance contract killing jobs,

48:20.208 --> 48:23.456
for me.

48:23.458 --> 48:24.750
For us.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.082
So uh,

48:34.084 --> 48:35.248
this one was

48:35.250 --> 48:37.289
okay, um,

48:37.291 --> 48:40.289
she, she was pretty, but not

48:40.291 --> 48:42.206
really

48:42.208 --> 48:43.373
star-level,

48:43.375 --> 48:45.206
she didn't have that,

48:45.208 --> 48:46.873
you know, actress look, that,

48:46.875 --> 48:47.915
that I was going for

48:47.917 --> 48:49.206
and that you want in a film,

48:49.208 --> 48:51.206
um,

48:51.208 --> 48:52.998
she, you know, her, her delivery

48:53.000 --> 48:54.206
was a bit off,

48:54.208 --> 48:57.373
she seemed on the unprofessional side,

48:57.375 --> 48:59.498
uh, you know, I'm usually a pretty good

48:59.500 --> 49:00.790
judge of character,

49:00.792 --> 49:02.706
and I can usually tell when somebody,

49:02.708 --> 49:04.123
uh, is going to behave on set,

49:04.125 --> 49:05.289
and be good on set,

49:05.291 --> 49:06.873
and when they're just not,

49:06.875 --> 49:09.790
um, I just didn't have good vibes

49:09.792 --> 49:12.665
about her, she, she was giving off some, uh,

49:12.667 --> 49:16.373
yeah, I just, I didn't, I wasn't a huge fan, um,

49:16.375 --> 49:18.665
you know, she was aight, but, just,

49:18.667 --> 49:20.581
she didn't compete with, uh,

49:20.583 --> 49:22.583
some of the other actresses that applied.

49:39.959 --> 49:42.289
Hi. My name is Jackie Morony,

49:42.291 --> 49:43.915
and I’m auditioning for the role

49:43.917 --> 49:45.792
of Angela Summering.

49:47.375 --> 49:50.289
Because you love yourself. You do.

49:50.291 --> 49:52.164
I always believed it.

49:52.166 --> 49:54.206
Even if you didn’t.

49:54.208 --> 49:56.289
Even when we were on the run.

49:56.291 --> 49:58.414
Avoiding the gangs.

49:58.416 --> 50:01.123
Avoiding my father.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.998
Even when you used to stay up all night

50:03.000 --> 50:05.123
saying you wanted to commit suicide

50:05.125 --> 50:07.123
for all the people you’ve killed.

50:07.125 --> 50:10.790
And you’d drink. And you’d hit me.

50:10.792 --> 50:13.123
And I’d hit you.

50:13.125 --> 50:16.289
And you’d drink some more.

50:16.291 --> 50:19.123
And you’d go out and kill.

50:19.125 --> 50:22.123
Just so we could have money.

50:22.125 --> 50:24.123
Still do contract killing jobs,

50:24.125 --> 50:26.123

for me.

50:31.000 --> 50:32.792
For us!

50:42.166 --> 50:44.206
Uh, yeah, so here we have

50:44.208 --> 50:46.998
someone who is trying to be an actress

50:47.000 --> 50:49.706
even though, uh, she's uh,

50:49.708 --> 50:51.915
well, I, she's a bit over the hill,

50:51.917 --> 50:52.915
I think, uh,

50:52.917 --> 50:54.915
this point in her life,

50:54.917 --> 50:56.498
if she hasn't made it anywhere

50:56.500 --> 50:58.790
she should, uh, probably call it quits,

50:58.792 --> 50:59.915
uh, definitely,

50:59.917 --> 51:01.915
I don't know what she's wearing either,

51:01.917 --> 51:03.623
uh, lookin' like Dorothy,

51:03.625 --> 51:05.373
uh, yeah, just,

51:05.375 --> 51:08.082
too old, um,

51:08.084 --> 51:09.706
too actor-y, I don't,

51:09.708 --> 51:10.915
there's something about her,

51:10.917 --> 51:13.831
it doesn't look like she's a real human even,

51:13.833 --> 51:15.915
it, it's a bit, it's, it's,

51:15.917 --> 51:17.998
almost robotic, it's, it's,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.915
too much of an actor vibe going on,

51:20.917 --> 51:22.581
this, this was not the one,

51:22.583 --> 51:23.623
uh,

51:23.625 --> 51:25.164
yeah, just, I would just quit,

51:25.166 --> 51:26.164
if I were you,

51:26.166 --> 51:28.416
I would not keep trying.

51:42.542 --> 51:44.331
Hello, my name is Georgia Byrd

51:53.917 --> 51:55.206
Avoiding the gangs.

51:55.208 --> 51:56.998
Avoiding my father.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.706
Even when you used to stay up all night

51:58.708 --> 52:01.414
saying you wanted to commit suicide

52:01.416 --> 52:03.331
for all the people you killed.

52:03.333 --> 52:05.540
And you’d drink. And you’d hit me.

Thank you!

52:28.500 --> 52:30.414
So this one was, uh,

52:30.416 --> 52:32.289
I mean, you can probably hear it, um,

52:32.291 --> 52:34.498
I, her voice was a no-go,

52:34.500 --> 52:36.540
if I had to listen to this

52:36.542 --> 52:38.498
for even one minute,

52:38.500 --> 52:39.498
let alone nine,

52:39.500 --> 52:41.082
I think I would kill myself,

52:41.084 --> 52:42.498
uh,

52:42.500 --> 52:44.206
her glasses are dumb,

52:44.208 --> 52:45.164
her outfit is dumb,

52:45.166 --> 52:46.540
she,

52:48.583 --> 52:51.082
uh, yeah, I don't, I, I didn't,

52:51.084 --> 52:53.082
I barely made it ten seconds into this tape

52:53.084 --> 52:55.289
before knowing, this, this was not the girl,

52:55.291 --> 52:56.957
yeah, no sir,

52:56.959 --> 52:58.498
no thank you,

52:58.500 --> 52:59.665
uh,

52:59.667 --> 53:01.583
just, just no. No.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.540
Hello.

53:32.542 --> 53:34.248
My name is Jared While,

You do!

53:44.542 --> 53:46.957

53:59.542 --> 54:01.831
for all the people you’ve killed.

54:02.416 --> 54:06.248

54:06.250 --> 54:07.957
And I’d hit you.

54:07.959 --> 54:10.623
And you’d drink some more.

54:10.625 --> 54:12.623
And you’d just go out and kill.

54:12.625 --> 54:14.748
Just so we could have money.

54:14.750 --> 54:16.040
Huh.

54:16.042 --> 54:17.623
Still do contract killing jobs,

54:17.625 --> 54:19.831
just for me.

54:19.833 --> 54:22.040

54:24.250 --> 54:26.040
for me.

54:26.042 --> 54:28.331
For us.

54:28.333 --> 54:30.248
Huh.

54:30.250 --> 54:32.957
I’m glad to know that I was right.

54:32.959 --> 54:35.040
Even if we can’t be alive,

54:35.042 --> 54:37.498
it’s good to be right.

54:37.500 --> 54:40.042
End scene.

54:48.875 --> 54:51.456
This guy here, um,

54:51.458 --> 54:53.665
is a bozo, uh,

54:53.667 --> 54:55.082
decided, I, I don't know if he was

54:55.084 --> 54:56.748
trying to fuck with me,

54:56.750 --> 54:58.456
or if he's just

54:58.458 --> 54:59.873
clinically insane,

54:59.875 --> 55:01.456
uh, the casting call

55:01.458 --> 55:03.581
clearly said women only,

55:03.583 --> 55:06.040
actresses only, it is a female role,

55:06.042 --> 55:07.581
the name was female,

55:07.583 --> 55:09.040
the casting call said female,

55:09.042 --> 55:10.665
everything about it's female,

55:10.667 --> 55:13.164
this bozo applied anyway,

55:13.166 --> 55:14.790
again, I don't know why,

55:14.792 --> 55:17.040
if he's trying to just mess with me,

55:17.042 --> 55:19.164
but it's a waste of my time,

55:19.166 --> 55:21.581
uh, a waste of his time too, quite frankly,

55:21.583 --> 55:22.665
um,

55:22.667 --> 55:25.581
this one just pissed me off, he, just,

55:27.042 --> 55:28.873
yeah, ah, did, just,

55:28.875 --> 55:29.957
what a fuckin' bozo,

55:29.959 --> 55:31.456
he's a fuckin' bozo,

55:31.458 --> 55:33.665
this, this was, uh,

55:33.667 --> 55:36.873
this, this here was a shit show,

55:36.875 --> 55:39.248
I don't know what he was even,

55:39.250 --> 55:41.456
who he thought he was, but, he's,

55:41.458 --> 55:43.331
he's not a girl as far as I can tell,

55:43.333 --> 55:44.915
I don't know if I'm missin' somethin',

55:44.917 --> 55:48.123
but uh, yeah, he, he doesn't,

55:48.125 --> 55:50.665
he doesn't appear to, uh, be right in the head,

55:50.667 --> 55:53.583
so, something's goin' on here.

56:26.084 --> 56:28.498

56:50.375 --> 56:53.790
for all the people you’ve killed.

56:53.792 --> 56:57.500
And then you’d drink. And you’d hit me.

56:59.000 --> 57:00.500
And I’d hit you.

57:01.583 --> 57:04.540
And then you’d go out and kill.

she has a perfect face,

57:40.458 --> 57:42.373
she has a perfect body,

57:42.375 --> 57:44.456
uh, she gave perfect delivery,

57:44.458 --> 57:46.706
she is everything that you want

57:46.708 --> 57:48.164
in an actress,

57:48.166 --> 57:49.456
um,

57:49.458 --> 57:50.831
wouldn't mind seein' her naked,

57:50.833 --> 57:52.456
her body is great, and,

57:52.458 --> 57:54.623
and she just looks

57:54.625 --> 57:57.040
perfect, and, um,

57:57.042 --> 57:58.373
it's very rare that you get that

57:58.375 --> 57:59.623
with a great delivery,

57:59.625 --> 58:01.123
sometimes you just can't find that,

58:01.125 --> 58:02.248
and you have to decide

58:02.250 --> 58:03.623
what you want to prioritize, but,

58:03.625 --> 58:05.831
she hit all the marks, um,

58:05.833 --> 58:08.248
definitely far above everybody else,

58:08.250 --> 58:09.456
uh,

58:09.458 --> 58:10.456
great voice as well,

58:10.458 --> 58:11.915
I could listen to her for hours,

58:11.917 --> 58:13.623
she is,

58:13.625 --> 58:15.456
uh, she was really great,

58:15.458 --> 58:16.873
she turned out to be really great,

58:16.875 --> 58:18.456
she is really great here,

58:18.458 --> 58:20.248
um, she definitely didn't disappoint,

58:20.250 --> 58:21.959
she, she's amazing.

58:34.291 --> 58:35.289
Hi William!

58:35.291 --> 58:36.706
Thanks so much for casting me,

58:36.708 --> 58:37.998
I’m super excited to get started

58:38.000 --> 58:39.289
on this project.

58:39.291 --> 58:40.581
Um, I don’t know how many of my

58:40.583 --> 58:42.082
clothes will work for the character,

58:42.084 --> 58:43.581
but, here are some options,

58:43.583 --> 58:44.957
as requested.

58:44.959 --> 58:47.917
Uh, I have this sweater.

58:50.166 --> 58:52.416
This blue romper.

58:53.959 --> 58:56.917
Flannels in different colors.

59:01.959 --> 59:04.625
Uh, some ripped skinny jeans.

59:06.208 --> 59:08.917
Black skinny jeans.

59:11.084 --> 59:14.915
And, for shoes I have these sneakers,

59:14.917 --> 59:17.792
and this pair of heeled boots.

59:18.917 --> 59:20.291
Let me know what you think!

59:27.375 --> 59:28.540
Hey!

59:28.542 --> 59:29.790
Here’s the outfit you chose.

59:29.792 --> 59:32.042
I like these clothes the best too.

59:49.708 --> 59:50.998
Hi William!

59:51.000 --> 59:52.206
I’m glad you like the outfit.

59:52.208 --> 59:53.790
Um, about the bra and the underwear,

59:53.792 --> 59:55.581
I don’t really think either would actually

59:55.583 --> 59:56.790
show at all underneath

59:56.792 --> 59:58.040
the outfit you chose,

59:58.042 --> 59:59.581
so, I actually don’t think we need

59:59.583 --> 01:00:00.915
to pick them out.

01:00:00.917 --> 01:00:02.123
Anyway, I’m looking forward to

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:02.873
meeting you,

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:04.164
and I can’t wait to get started

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.166
on this project!

01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:12.289
Hi William,

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.706
I’m really sorry.

01:00:13.708 --> 01:00:15.123
I totally understand what you mean

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:16.289
about being a perfectionist

01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:17.831
and wanting to get this character down

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:18.915
one hundred percent,

01:00:18.917 --> 01:00:20.915
even to every little thing she wears.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:22.706
I promise I’m not ‘unprofessional’

01:00:22.708 --> 01:00:24.123
or ‘uptight’,

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:25.706
I totally understand that this film

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:27.123
means a lot to you.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.123
Here are some options.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.625
I have a black halter top bra.

01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:35.500
This nude bra.

01:00:36.917 --> 01:00:38.915
A burgundy one.

01:00:38.917 --> 01:00:40.498
And for underwear,

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:42.123
I have

01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:44.125
this plaid pair,

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:48.208
a red pair,

01:00:50.416 --> 01:00:52.581
and a black pair.

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:54.373
Let me know which ones you'd like me to wear

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.289
underneath the outfit, and I will do so.

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:58.375
Looking for to meeting you and working with you!

01:01:04.583 --> 01:01:05.790
Hi William!

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:06.957
This is the outfit,

01:01:06.959 --> 01:01:08.456
and I’m wearing the bra and underwear

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:09.873
you chose underneath.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.082
I’m looking forward to meeting

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.084
and working with you!

01:03:41.291 --> 01:03:44.581
So, this is the space,

01:03:44.583 --> 01:03:47.458
um, having a wrap party for

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.998
the film, uh,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.456
Sai was not able to be here,

01:03:53.458 --> 01:03:55.915
his mom couldn't let him go

01:03:55.917 --> 01:03:58.581
or some shit, I don't know, um,

01:03:58.583 --> 01:04:01.665
and uh, Courtney, uh,

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:03.373
cancelled a few days ago,

01:04:03.375 --> 01:04:04.915
so, um,

01:04:04.917 --> 01:04:05.998
she'll, have, I'll have a

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.456
special guest coming in,

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:08.790
in place of her,

01:04:08.792 --> 01:04:10.248
um, so just, you know,

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:11.998
gonna carry on with things,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.998
got some, uh,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.706
some cool musical equipment here.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.998
Heh.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.373
Um,

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.082
yeah, so,

01:04:25.084 --> 01:04:26.998
we got some cool artwork on the walls,

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.164
um, yeah, it's a shame everybody couldn't come.

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.373
No one is here but me.

01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:34.289
Um, we'll have,

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:36.289
like I said, um, I'll, I'll have a guest

01:04:36.291 --> 01:04:37.873
coming, and,

01:04:37.875 --> 01:04:40.790
we'll just sort of, do our thing, but uh,

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:42.790
yeah, everyone else is gone.

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:44.248
No one else is here.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.998
At all.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.040
No one else is here.

01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:49.581
So, this is great.

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:51.164
Um, non-refundable, this place,

01:04:51.166 --> 01:04:53.164
so I gotta, you know,

01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:55.790
do something, I don't have

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:56.998
much of a choice, uh,

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.998
that should up there have a DVD player,

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.665
somewhere, I'll try to find that.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:05.248
Alrighty.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.998
Uh, so, just, say your name, if you could.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.706
Um, hi, I'm Myia.

01:05:10.708 --> 01:05:12.581
- You're,
- Are you, are you William?

01:05:12.583 --> 01:05:14.164
- I am, yes, uh, yeah, it's,
- Okay, hi.

01:05:14.166 --> 01:05:15.790
it's nice to meet you, um,

01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:16.998
I'm here for the wrap party.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.915
Yes, yes, of course, um,

01:05:18.917 --> 01:05:19.998
so just, come over here,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.289
you can join me in this little area,

01:05:22.291 --> 01:05:25.373
this can be our little home for the day,

01:05:25.375 --> 01:05:27.873
uh, it'll be just the two of us, cause,

01:05:27.875 --> 01:05:29.998
- nobody else could make it, so,
- Oh, that's fine.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.248
it's uh,

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.373
it's just us.

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:34.373
Um,

01:05:34.375 --> 01:05:36.040
yeah, so, uh,

01:05:36.042 --> 01:05:37.373
up there, I, I gotta figure out

01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:38.790
how that thing works, but,

01:05:38.792 --> 01:05:40.790
we'll probably just get the film going up there,

01:05:40.792 --> 01:05:41.706
and just

01:05:41.708 --> 01:05:43.082
watch it together, and just

01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:44.498
- sort of have a good time.
- Okay.

01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.040
Um,

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:45.998
are you recording?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.164
Mhm. Yeah, I'm recording.

01:05:47.166 --> 01:05:48.373
Alright, um,

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:50.581
so, the place said that it had a DVD player,

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:52.289
so we could, you know,

01:05:52.291 --> 01:05:53.373
show the film,

01:05:53.375 --> 01:05:54.998
um, there's nothing up here,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.164
there's some random cables,

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:58.373
but there's no box or anything,

01:05:58.375 --> 01:06:01.164
um, back here there's another TV,

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.998
but still no DVD player,

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.998
there's about twenty five

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.790
fucking keyboards, and

01:06:06.792 --> 01:06:07.998
there's not one,

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.164
uh,

01:06:11.166 --> 01:06:12.998
That's really frustrating, I'm sorry.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.998
Yeah, uh, do you,

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.998
do you see one,

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.998
am I missing it,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.581
or something?

01:06:17.583 --> 01:06:19.373
No, I don't think you're missing anything,

01:06:19.375 --> 01:06:20.915
I don't see a DVD player either.

01:06:20.917 --> 01:06:22.373
Mhm. Yeah, um,

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:25.289
so, the, the, we're basically, um,

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:26.998
screwed in that department,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:27.998
but whatever, it's fine,

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.998
um, we'll just keep going,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.498
uh, I guess we will, um,

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.665
maybe

01:06:33.667 --> 01:06:36.040
try to,

01:06:36.042 --> 01:06:37.998
we'll figure something out, I don't know,

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.790
I really don't know, um,

01:06:40.792 --> 01:06:42.665
maybe watch it on my phone, or something, or,

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:43.998
Yeah, I would love to!

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.373
- Just sit on the couch together,
- Mhm.

01:06:46.375 --> 01:06:47.665
and just sort of, watch it,

01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:48.498
watch it that way,

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.790
that might literally be our only choice,

01:06:50.792 --> 01:06:52.373
uh, this was supposed to be a wrat,

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:53.706
a wrap party!

01:06:53.708 --> 01:06:55.040
Wrap party! It was supposed to be

01:06:55.042 --> 01:06:56.915
- a wrap party, but no one's here,
- I'm,

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:57.915
There's no way to even

01:06:57.917 --> 01:06:58.915
watch the fuckin' film.

01:06:58.917 --> 01:06:59.998
Well, I'm here, and I can

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:00.998
watch the film with you.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.164
Yeah.

01:07:02.166 --> 01:07:03.706
This thing is useless now,

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:06.665
cause there's no DVD player,

01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:08.040
nobody came to the

01:07:08.042 --> 01:07:09.373
wrap party,

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:10.998
do you want to, just,

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.082
do, do you have your phone

01:07:12.084 --> 01:07:13.040
- or, or something
- Mhm.

01:07:13.042 --> 01:07:13.998
Could we just,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.373
could we pull it up or something?

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:17.331
Yeah, why don't we just watch it on my phone.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:18.998
Yeah, uh, I mean, I guess we have to,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.414
because no one's here and there's

01:07:20.416 --> 01:07:22.665
no DVD player and there's

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:24.706
Well, the couch is great.

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:25.790
Is it? Yeah?

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:26.998
- It's a good couch?
- Yeah.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.040
Good, you know,

01:07:28.042 --> 01:07:29.289
- I paid for the couch
- I know.

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:30.581
cause I paid for the space,

01:07:30.583 --> 01:07:32.581
and then no one came to the space because

01:07:32.583 --> 01:07:33.665
they said they were gonna,

01:07:33.667 --> 01:07:34.915
and then they didn't.

01:07:34.917 --> 01:07:37.581
Why don't you just sit down and relax?

01:07:37.583 --> 01:07:39.458
Uh, yeah, I don't, um,

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.373
Can I start watching now?

01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:53.665
Yeah, yeah, yeah, press, uh,

01:07:53.667 --> 01:07:55.164
press play.

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:10.790
So, tell everybody, uh,

01:08:10.792 --> 01:08:11.581
what you thought,

01:08:11.583 --> 01:08:12.790
what you thought of the film.

01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:13.706
Um,

01:08:13.708 --> 01:08:14.998
I really liked it.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.163
- Yeah? Did you?
- Um,

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:17.872
it was really interesting.

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:19.288
Yeah, I mean, it, it was

01:08:19.291 --> 01:08:21.040
- a bit of a twist, right?
- Mhm.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:21.997
It was, uh, eh, uh,

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.372
- Yeah, I was not expecting that.
- Probably, right, right,

01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:26.997
- well that's, that's the goal.
- I was not expecting that at all.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.581
What about with, uh, with uh, uh, when, when,

01:08:30.582 --> 01:08:32.915
the, there's the gangster who's,

01:08:32.917 --> 01:08:34.997
uh, by the trees, and then, uh,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.247
we find out later that that gangster actually

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:39.372
might have been the guy who killed me

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:40.372
right, and then, that's,

01:08:40.375 --> 01:08:42.372
Yeah, he might have been the one who killed you.

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:43.163
- Right.
- Right.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:44.581
Yeah, it really worked for me.

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.375
Cool, cool.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.872
Okay, um, so,

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.372
uh, there's a little, uh,

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:54.082
secret that I wanna go over, do you,

01:08:54.084 --> 01:08:55.163
do you mind, or,

01:08:55.166 --> 01:08:56.997
can I, about, can I tell them about you?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.790
- Oh, oh, yeah, whatever.
- Okay, cool, uh,

01:08:58.792 --> 01:09:00.497
so Myia over here is actually

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.163
an escort that I paid to be here

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:04.997
because, uh, our actress Courtney

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.497
said that she wasn't going to be able

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.997
to make it here, just a few days ago,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.163
so, uh, fuck Courtney,

01:09:10.166 --> 01:09:13.581
um, Myia is a terrific person,

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.997
and, um, better than Courtney, so,

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.581
uh, thank you for being here,

01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:19.163
- Oh, thank you, that's so sweet.
- And,

01:09:19.166 --> 01:09:21.997
Sai said that his mom isn't letting him come,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.872
and, uh,

01:09:23.875 --> 01:09:24.997
that's probably bullshit,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.997
he's just a pussy,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.040
but, um, Myia's here,

01:09:29.042 --> 01:09:30.247
which is super great,

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:31.790
and uh, we just watched the film,

01:09:31.792 --> 01:09:32.997
you liked the film, right?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:33.915
I loved the film.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:35.247
She loved the film, right, she,

01:09:35.250 --> 01:09:37.082

01:09:37.084 --> 01:09:38.247
Got her reaction to that.

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:39.163
Um,

01:09:39.166 --> 01:09:40.706
yeah, so uh,

01:09:40.707 --> 01:09:42.247
thank you, thank you for actually

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.706
showing up to

01:09:43.707 --> 01:09:45.872
something that somebody told you to come to

01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:47.790
that you said that you would come to, and,

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:50.040
you actually did, so, thank you for that.

01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:51.997

01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.164
That must be,

01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:03.164

Um,

01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:08.665
Just, could you, sit up a little bit more?

01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:09.915
Yeah, oh, absolutely.

Or no?

01:10:32.792 --> 01:10:33.873
