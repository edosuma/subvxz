00:05.273 --> 00:06.508
Previously on "Mr. Mercedes"...

00:08.343 --> 00:11.613
Thank you for this,
but stay the fuck away from my house.

00:11.813 --> 00:13.081
I mean it. Yeah, I heard you.

00:13.281 --> 00:15.617
You fucked yourself, and you fucked me

00:15.817 --> 00:17.486
because if they can't replace me,

00:17.686 --> 00:18.220
they can't promote me!

00:18.420 --> 00:21.623
It was the voices. That killed Ollie.

00:21.823 --> 00:22.491
I tried so hard to hear them,

00:22.691 --> 00:23.892
but Ollie said that they knew
that I was listening,

00:24.092 --> 00:25.427
and so they'd whisper.

00:25.627 --> 00:26.361
Mom?

00:28.663 --> 00:30.365
Fuck.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.035
You burned a woman doing a dye job

00:34.235 --> 00:35.604
because you were shit-faced.

00:35.804 --> 00:38.573
The woman sued.
Jaime almost lost the shop.

00:38.773 --> 00:40.275
But I'm sober now.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.977
Good for you, Deb.

00:42.177 --> 00:44.046
Ta-da!

00:44.246 --> 00:46.114
I figured you might want a drink.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.716
Why?

00:47.916 --> 00:49.584
Wean you off the stuff.

04:06.080 --> 04:11.018
They took her body to, um, Silver's...

04:11.218 --> 04:12.753
Right.
Funeral Home.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.688
Do you know it?

04:13.888 --> 04:16.156
Yeah,
my next-door neighbor used to run it.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.825
Her son still does, I think.

04:18.024 --> 04:19.493
Well, they'll see you right.

04:21.963 --> 04:25.566
Uh, do you know anyone who can
cater the after-funeral?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.703
Milligan's is pretty good.

04:28.903 --> 04:29.770
Milligan's it is.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.907
Olivia's.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.509
Right.

04:34.709 --> 04:37.311
It's grand stuff.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.046
Thank you. Brilliant.

04:39.246 --> 04:40.514
That's good.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.383
Thanks.

04:42.583 --> 04:46.721
That's great stuff.

04:49.724 --> 04:54.262
Republican and Democratic
leaders in the White House...

05:13.481 --> 05:16.550
Time to eat some shit.

05:16.750 --> 05:21.555
Jerome?

05:22.556 --> 05:25.226
A word... A word, perhaps?

05:28.562 --> 05:31.365
I was a bit of a dick.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.103
Look, I could've handled things better.

05:35.303 --> 05:38.906
Your father was worried.
I was worried, okay?

05:42.376 --> 05:44.779
There's a limit to the ass I'll kiss.

05:44.979 --> 05:45.446
I've no gift for puckering.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.914
You were a prick.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.517
You could have just asked me
to back off,

05:50.717 --> 05:53.787
but you got mean
and showed me zero respect.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.058
I'm dealing with a dangerous fella,
Jerome.

05:57.258 --> 05:57.825
I need you to steer clear

05:58.025 --> 05:59.927
of even the appearance
of working with me.

06:00.127 --> 06:03.464
So then, by all means,
allow me to steer clear.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.868
There was a "but"? I'm sorry.

06:07.068 --> 06:10.471
But I don't know fuck-all about
computers, as you well know,

06:10.671 --> 06:14.342
and I need to get into one
that's password-protected.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.877
Well, shit.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.079
Someone in that position
should definitely reconsider

06:18.279 --> 06:19.947
then. their puckering stance,

06:20.147 --> 06:21.415
I fucking apologized.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.851
I-I said I was an asshole.
No, you didn't.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.087
No, you said you were a "bit of a dick."

06:26.287 --> 06:28.222
Well, I admitted that I could
have handled it better.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.658
I'm sorry. All right.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.894
I didn't show you respect.

06:33.094 --> 06:35.163
You deserved it.
I didn't give it to you.

06:35.363 --> 06:37.898
I'd throw meself down
in front of your feet there,

06:38.098 --> 06:40.467
only there's a fence in the way.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.037
For fuck's sake, I'd look stupid.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.512
Shit, Nubian, I can work with that.

07:00.388 --> 07:02.023
So, whose laptop?

07:02.223 --> 07:03.658
Olivia Trelawney's.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.060
Lady who owned the Mercedes? Yup.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.929
Well, I mean, do you know enough
about her personal life

07:09.129 --> 07:09.597
to help me crack that password?

07:09.797 --> 07:11.199
Ah, I do not.

07:11.399 --> 07:13.601
But I might know someone who does.

07:13.801 --> 07:17.071
Go ahead. Finish Ida's lawn.
I'll see you in a bit.

07:26.680 --> 07:30.618
Off to work. Bye, Mom.

07:30.818 --> 07:32.286
Have a great day.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.845
Open the door.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.048
That is my workspace. No fucking way.

08:18.132 --> 08:20.734
Here it is.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.537
What is it?

08:33.147 --> 08:34.847
If Robi said you have Saturday off,

08:35.048 --> 08:36.750
he has no idea what he's talk...

08:36.950 --> 08:39.486
Brady. Hey, Brady.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.956
You can't go back there.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.957
Why?

08:44.158 --> 08:46.093
Here. Come here.

08:46.293 --> 08:51.232
The, um, D.M. stopped by
for a little surprise visit.

08:51.432 --> 08:53.234
He's back there with Robi.

08:53.434 --> 08:56.037
So, what's up?

08:56.237 --> 08:57.905
Dude, I have no fucking idea.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.573
But they called a whole company meeting

08:59.773 --> 09:01.108
in about half-hour from now.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.512
You're working on Sunday.
You know that, right?

09:07.181 --> 09:09.617
<i>Here comes the pain</i>

09:09.817 --> 09:12.053
Ah, well, well, well.

09:12.253 --> 09:14.922
Look who finally decided to show up.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.924
It's not even five after.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.860
He's too easy, this one. Hey.

09:20.060 --> 09:20.861
Holly, this is Jerome.

09:21.061 --> 09:21.662
You don't have to laugh at his jokes.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.997
Jerome, this is Holly.

09:23.197 --> 09:25.666
It's a pleasure to meet you, Holly.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.268
Go ahead. Okay.

09:27.468 --> 09:29.069
Now...

09:31.605 --> 09:32.673
it's all you, my man.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.241
Time to shine.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.344
I'll shine so bright
you're gonna need Ray-Bans, man.

09:37.544 --> 09:40.481
Excuse me, Jerome?

09:40.681 --> 09:43.617
I was just wondering
if it would still be a pleasure

09:43.817 --> 09:46.754
for you to meet me,
but this time with your left hand?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.489
Oh.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.624
Pleasure to meet you, Holly.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.159
Thank you.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.760
Now,
whaddaya say we break into this computer

09:53.960 --> 09:55.362
and show the old man
how it's done, yeah?

09:55.562 --> 09:56.497
I guess.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.369
Oh.

10:01.569 --> 10:05.239
Olivia left the password hint blank.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.107
Probably didn't even know
that was an option.

10:07.307 --> 10:08.909
So, what do we do?

10:09.109 --> 10:14.248
Well, this, my friends, can
crack any password there is.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.450
It uses a program called "Dictionary,"

10:16.650 --> 10:18.385
and what it is,
is you set it into the computer...

10:18.585 --> 10:20.854
Hang on. Is... Is this thing legal?

10:21.054 --> 10:23.324
Is anything we're doing here legal?

10:23.524 --> 10:25.726
Excuse me? I have a question.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.728
Yeah, hold on.
Let me just set this up real quick.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.963
I was just wondering if maybe you knew

10:30.163 --> 10:32.199
that you were about
to destroy everything.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.470
Uh, I'm sorry?

10:36.670 --> 10:39.340
Well, Apple's been onto DPCs
for a while now,

10:39.540 --> 10:41.542
so if you even try to run Dictionary,

10:41.742 --> 10:43.744
you'll wipe out the entire hard drive.

10:43.944 --> 10:44.812
So if what you're looking to do

10:45.012 --> 10:46.997
is break in through an unknown exploit,

10:47.197 --> 10:49.308
we should just create
a new Admin Account

10:49.508 --> 10:51.619
by opening up Terminal in Recovery Mode.

10:57.758 --> 11:02.029
Do you think that maybe
they have chocolate milk here?

11:02.229 --> 11:02.730
Um...

11:02.930 --> 11:04.181
Dolly? Can we get a chocolate milk?

11:04.381 --> 11:05.633
Coming right up.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.034
Thank you.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.572
Janey's calling you.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.842
Yeah, I'll just...
I'll just take this real quick.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.044
Hiya.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.313
Yeah. Everything okay?

11:22.316 --> 11:25.052
No, no, no, we don't need
to bring two cars.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.988
How 'bout I swing 'round
about 15, 20 minutes?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.191
Thanks for that.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.993
Uh, Jerome,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.596
think you'd be able to drop
Holly off on your way home?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.764
Y-You're leaving? Now?

11:37.964 --> 11:39.733
Well, Janey needs my help.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.102
You guys, I can't help you
with anything there, so...

11:42.302 --> 11:44.471
I mean, I can drop you
on the way if you need it.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.674
But since you saved me just now,

11:46.874 --> 11:49.009
I'm pretty sure I can't crack
this code without you.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.346
So, I mean, do you mind sticking
around long enough to help?

11:54.615 --> 11:59.486
I think that's probably
a very good idea, yes.

11:59.686 --> 12:00.287
Yeah, me too.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.889
All right. Great.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.557
Well, here. That should cover it.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.359
Well, Jerome and I
have lots of work to do,

12:05.559 --> 12:07.161
so you can go be with Janey now
if you want.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
Okay.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.237
Hey, mad gratitude.

12:16.437 --> 12:18.839
Uh, you mind if I slide
around next to you there?

12:19.039 --> 12:20.907
Sure.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.742
Awesome.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.378
Cool. So...

12:24.578 --> 12:26.313
Trying to figure this out.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.048
Here's your chocolate milk.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.783
Thank you. You're welcome.

12:32.119 --> 12:36.123
Give me just one moment.

12:36.323 --> 12:36.390
Mmm, that's good.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.592
Yeah.

14:06.547 --> 14:09.016
They all here?
Yeah.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.685
No, you sit with them, please.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.369
You know what "plan" is?

14:29.569 --> 14:30.637
Not a plan.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.706
Plan.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.775
"Plan" is the projected earnings

14:34.975 --> 14:36.243
every year that a manager has to achieve

14:36.443 --> 14:39.780
if he wants to contribute
to keeping this company solvent.

14:39.980 --> 14:46.119
Plan is 6% beyond what was made
the previous year.

14:46.319 --> 14:49.456
That's it. That's all there is to it.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.792
He's not making plan.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.929
He's making 5%, not 6%.

14:56.129 --> 15:01.068
You know what's keeping him
from making 6%?

15:01.268 --> 15:02.403
Losers.

15:02.603 --> 15:08.609
World's real simple...
It's made of winners and you.

15:08.809 --> 15:11.144
Now, you might assume that I feel sorry

15:11.344 --> 15:13.680
for you and your "disadvantages"...

15:13.880 --> 15:15.749
whatever the fuck they are.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.284
I don't.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.020
You don't work hard,
you don't believe in shit,

15:20.220 --> 15:22.756
and you never pull together
for the greater good.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.559
You whine and make sarcastic comments,

15:25.759 --> 15:28.162
but when it comes time to get paid,

15:28.362 --> 15:33.300
you're always there
sticking your hands out.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.236
So how about you all go find
a job somewhere else?

15:40.641 --> 15:43.043
Oh, that's right.

15:43.243 --> 15:46.113
There is nowhere else.

15:46.313 --> 15:46.814
We cut you loose,

15:47.014 --> 15:49.199
and you're three missed paychecks away

15:49.399 --> 15:51.585
from 70-hour workweeks and a meth habit

15:51.785 --> 15:53.654
doing day labor at Cartman Grains.

15:53.854 --> 15:56.123
So, should I care?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.392
Do you pay my bills?

15:58.592 --> 16:01.361
Feed my kids?
Keep my heat on in February?

16:01.561 --> 16:04.331
No. So fuck you
and your bills and your kids.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.401
You can sit in the dark and starve.

16:10.103 --> 16:15.609
Or you can step up
and accept who your Daddy is.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.679
You better get it through
your heads right fucking here

16:18.879 --> 16:19.813
and right fucking now,

16:20.013 --> 16:22.015
or you can stay home
tomorrow and forevermore.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.885
Now, this 1% that he's short right now?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.420
That's coming out of your hides.

16:26.620 --> 16:27.221
Not his.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.691
He's a good man.

16:30.891 --> 16:35.912
Limited, sure, but good.

16:36.112 --> 16:40.934
No, to make up this 1%,

16:41.134 --> 16:44.438
we have to go
full-on fucking Mayan.

16:44.638 --> 16:48.575
The gods demand a sacrifice.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.316
That gonna be you?

16:59.920 --> 17:01.588
You?

17:04.590 --> 17:06.059
You?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.799
Nah, you're the best tech guy we got,

17:11.999 --> 17:14.201
and your customer-satisfaction
ratings are...

17:14.401 --> 17:15.868
God knows why... stellar.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.071
So...

17:19.271 --> 17:22.075
who's it gonna be?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.554
Clean out your locker, DeGeneres.

17:34.754 --> 17:35.989
We're parting ways.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.624
Are you kidding me?
What are you t...

17:37.824 --> 17:39.293
Brady.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.762
Are you fucking kidding me?

17:41.962 --> 17:42.429
What, security?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.898
Dude, get your hands off me!

17:45.098 --> 17:45.966
Robi.

17:47.901 --> 17:48.769
Robi!

17:48.969 --> 17:50.537
We're five steps ahead of you.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.305
And we are fucking into it.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.440
Oh, wow.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.308
Get your fucking hands off me!

17:55.508 --> 17:56.376
Are you kidding me?

17:56.576 --> 17:57.344
You don't even know what I do here!

17:57.544 --> 18:00.447
What the fuck? Robi!

18:03.583 --> 18:05.385
Really?

18:10.257 --> 18:12.793
Back to work, ladies.

18:12.993 --> 18:14.728
Alright. Uh, let's get on the floor.

18:14.928 --> 18:15.562
Come on.
That's wrong, man.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.932
Come on.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.554
Ms. Patterson?
Come in.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.156
Yes.
Timothy Silver.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.426
Hi, Tim.
Good to see you, Bill.

18:46.626 --> 18:47.327
Hello, Bill.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.513
Ida. This is Janelle Patterson.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.141
Janelle. I'm sorry for your loss.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.769
Thank you.
Call me Janey, please.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.237
Janey, then.

18:57.437 --> 18:59.573
Why don't we head
to the parlor so we can talk?

19:04.778 --> 19:06.446
And her date of birth?

19:06.646 --> 19:10.717
August 4, 1929.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.887
She lived a good long life.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.857
She did. Sh...
Yeah, she did.

19:17.057 --> 19:22.062
So, the service
is at Immaculate Heart at 9:00.

19:22.262 --> 19:22.996
Burial at Cedar Grove.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.800
You said Father Ahern
will preside over both.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.668
He's a good man, Jack Ahern.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.537
Very sensitive.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.938
That's good to hear.

19:32.138 --> 19:34.207
Thank you.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.346
Is there a restroom?

19:39.546 --> 19:42.482
Just down by the stairs to your right.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.422
We'll do right by her, Bill.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.491
I know you will, Tim. Thanks.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.697
Well, she's quite lovely, isn't she?

20:05.238 --> 20:07.307
Very easy on the eyes.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.727
Did you find your mom?

20:30.664 --> 20:31.965
I did, yeah.

20:32.165 --> 20:34.201
Glad things worked out for you.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.142
You see Lou after?

20:43.143 --> 20:45.345
No. She was already gone.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.619
Brady.

20:55.956 --> 20:57.524
This time yesterday,

20:57.724 --> 21:00.293
I thought I'd be in the
upper-management track by now.

21:00.493 --> 21:03.096
Lou thought she'd have a job.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.999
Now I'm going nowhere.
Or worse.

21:06.199 --> 21:08.902
And Lou's applying for unemployment.

21:11.171 --> 21:12.572
You, though?

21:12.772 --> 21:15.775
You come out smelling like a rose.

21:18.845 --> 21:19.613
Yeah.

21:19.813 --> 21:22.048
Yeah, that happens to me sometimes.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.251
The other night?

21:24.451 --> 21:25.719
I went to Shop 'n Save

21:25.919 --> 21:29.439
'cause I wanted
a Pepperoni Pizza Hot Pocket.

21:29.639 --> 21:33.159
Go to the frozen food locker,
and they're out.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.395
They got Steak and Cheddar.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.797
They got Meatballs and Mozzarella.

21:37.997 --> 21:38.931
No pepperoni.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.066
I'm like, "Fuck!"

21:40.266 --> 21:41.535
You know?

21:41.735 --> 21:43.536
But just as I'm leaving?

21:43.736 --> 21:45.338
Out comes the stock girl

21:45.538 --> 21:51.611
with a stack of
Pepperoni Pizza Hot Pockets!

21:51.811 --> 21:55.015
I'm like, "Man!"

21:55.215 --> 21:58.518
You know?

21:58.718 --> 22:01.822
I buy four.

22:02.022 --> 22:06.493
Go home just so, ya know,

22:06.693 --> 22:07.627
tickled.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.736
I will pick myself up.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.774
I will focus, I will envision,
and I will actualize.

22:20.974 --> 22:23.310
I will be a district manager someday.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.377
And a few years later,

22:24.577 --> 22:26.379
I'll be a helluva lot bigger than that.

22:30.917 --> 22:33.720
But you'll always be you, Brady.

22:35.322 --> 22:39.125
And what could be
fucking lamer than that?

22:43.930 --> 22:47.133
I'm almost...

22:47.333 --> 22:49.069
Done.

22:50.804 --> 22:51.605
Uh...

22:51.805 --> 22:53.740
Damn.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.875
We're in! Yep.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.544
High. Oh.

22:59.279 --> 23:01.681
Sessions.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.584
Yeah. I was just reading that, too.

23:04.784 --> 23:07.287
Does that mean anything to you?

23:07.487 --> 23:09.756
No, but it definitely meant
something to Ollie

23:09.956 --> 23:12.225
because it's the only file
on her entire desktop

23:12.425 --> 23:13.960
that's not organized into a folder,

23:14.160 --> 23:18.231
and Ollie did not leave things
lying around for no reason.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.501
Well,
aren't you curious as to what's in it?

23:23.503 --> 23:25.505
If what's actually in it
is what I think is in it,

23:25.705 --> 23:28.975
then I'm very curious, yes.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.710
So I say we open it.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.580
Just to see what's inside, I mean.
Then get out.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.248
It's not that big of a deal, right?

23:35.448 --> 23:38.718
Okay.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.438
The hell?

23:42.638 --> 23:43.957
Encryptions?

23:44.157 --> 23:47.460
Ollie definitely did not
know how to encrypt files.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.662
Okay.
Well, if she didn't, then someone did.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.865
We just have to figure out
another way in. Okay?

23:52.065 --> 23:53.633
Mm.

23:55.335 --> 23:57.537
Okay. Yeah, no.
I already placed the order.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.805
Yeah.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.208
Look, let me get a quick shower.

24:01.408 --> 24:04.477
I'll come over, and we can go
through the rest of the details.

24:04.677 --> 24:07.347
But we got this, okay?

24:07.547 --> 24:10.483
No,
nothing's slipping through the cracks.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.422
You just concentrate on the eulogy.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.956
That's plenty right now.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.930
Yeah. Uh, write down the things
you liked about her best.

24:24.130 --> 24:27.767
It's probably what everyone else
liked about her, too.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.103
Yeah. All right. See you in a bit.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.239
<i>Forget your heroes</i>

24:32.439 --> 24:37.377
<i>You don't really need
those lasting lessons</i>

24:41.581 --> 24:44.451
<i>Stand in the open</i>

24:44.651 --> 24:49.122
<i>The next voice you hear will be your own</i>

24:59.399 --> 25:03.136
<i>But, all right,
they knew how they could hurt you</i>

25:06.005 --> 25:09.342
<i>And you let them cut you to the bone</i>

25:12.111 --> 25:13.013
<i>But God forbid</i>

25:13.213 --> 25:18.685
<i>You allow them to rid you of your virtue</i>

25:23.556 --> 25:26.493
<i>Forget their laughter</i>

25:26.693 --> 25:30.763
<i>The next voice you hear will be your own</i>

25:35.502 --> 25:38.771
<i>Throw down your truth
and check your weapons</i>

25:41.174 --> 25:44.911
<i>Don't look to see if you're alone</i>

25:46.980 --> 25:49.649
<i>Just stand your ground</i>

25:49.849 --> 25:53.586
<i>And don't turn around, whatever happens</i>

25:58.858 --> 26:01.328
<i>Don't ask directions</i>

26:01.528 --> 26:05.798
<i>The next voice you hear will be your own</i>

26:34.561 --> 26:37.030
What's the first thing you think of

26:37.230 --> 26:38.498
when you think about her?

26:38.698 --> 26:40.300
Her poise.

26:43.136 --> 26:44.571
Well, write that down.

26:44.771 --> 26:45.905
I did.

26:47.507 --> 26:49.008
Mm-hmm.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.512
And I wrote that she
attended Pitt College

26:52.712 --> 26:54.447
on a full scholarship,

26:54.647 --> 26:56.316
which is where she met my father.

26:56.516 --> 27:00.453
And then they moved here,
where he set up his practice

27:00.653 --> 27:03.122
and she taught at community college,

27:03.322 --> 27:05.792
and blah-blah blah-blah blah-blah.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.063
What did you like about her?

27:10.263 --> 27:12.665
I don't know.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.200
What do you mean, you don't know?

27:14.400 --> 27:17.003
I-I don't know.

27:19.272 --> 27:23.343
My... My mother wasn't
an emotional exhibitionist.

27:23.543 --> 27:26.212
She kept herself to herself,

27:26.412 --> 27:27.480
as they say.

27:27.680 --> 27:33.953
She was never really mean
that I remember.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.888
I wouldn't write that down.

27:36.088 --> 27:36.689
W...

27:41.027 --> 27:43.896
She wasn't really particularly warm,
either,

27:44.096 --> 27:47.033
unless she'd had too many glasses of...

27:47.233 --> 27:48.301
Pinot.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.303
I don't know.

27:50.503 --> 27:53.506
What was your relationship
like with your mother?

27:53.706 --> 27:55.942
Not bad.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.044
Did you know her?

27:59.312 --> 28:00.913
I did know her, yes. She was my mother.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.983
Did you know her?

28:05.652 --> 28:07.987
Not really, I guess.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.858
That generation.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.460
Exactly.

28:13.660 --> 28:17.730
That generation didn't talk
about their feelings.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.466
They didn't treat a cup of coffee

28:20.666 --> 28:23.002
as an invitation to a confessional.

28:23.202 --> 28:26.806
They sure as shit didn't engage
with their children.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.543
My mother was nice, okay.

28:30.743 --> 28:36.148
She...
She was full of grace and...poi...

28:36.348 --> 28:41.754
She...knew a lot about European history.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.690
And she... she liked card games

28:43.890 --> 28:48.294
and...W.H. Auden.

28:50.229 --> 28:54.767
She liked veal scallopini and, um...

28:54.967 --> 28:56.903
"Jeopardy!"

28:57.103 --> 28:58.571
Okay. Write that down.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.806
Sh...She liked riding her bicycle...

29:01.006 --> 29:02.758
well, before she got her hip replaced.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.711
There you go.
But that's not the person.

29:04.911 --> 29:08.181
That's... That's what the person did.

29:10.083 --> 29:11.451
We are what we do.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.254
Oh, thank you, Aristotle.

29:17.457 --> 29:19.792
Are we?

29:34.207 --> 29:36.809
Is it possible that I didn't
really know my own mother?

29:40.113 --> 29:43.216
You knew as much as any of us
can about anybody else.

29:53.024 --> 29:54.092
Mm.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.899
You're amused.

30:01.099 --> 30:03.702
I thought you burned
all of my old journals.

30:03.902 --> 30:07.706
I kept one to remind me of
who you were before you changed.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.441
And who was I?

30:12.577 --> 30:14.846
What are these plastic tubes?

30:17.983 --> 30:20.352
I use them for a lot
of different projects.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.921
You know, computer stuff,
electronics stuff.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.123
It's easier to buy in bulk.

30:25.323 --> 30:27.726
How could you use this in a computer?

30:27.926 --> 30:29.561
Little tiny sections of it.

30:29.761 --> 30:31.780
Wouldn't it burn? Melt?

30:31.980 --> 30:33.799
No.
But in electronics...

30:33.999 --> 30:35.534
Do you know a lot about electronics?

30:35.734 --> 30:38.570
I know a bit about electricity.

30:38.770 --> 30:41.606
Pillow talk between you and Dad?

30:43.475 --> 30:45.611
What else could this be used for?

30:45.811 --> 30:47.913
I don't know.
What else could this be used for?

30:48.113 --> 30:50.215
That's what I'm asking.
That's what I'm asking.

30:50.415 --> 30:52.417
Brady.
Mom.

30:52.617 --> 30:55.887
What could this be used for?

31:06.298 --> 31:08.500
Why was this in your closet?

31:10.969 --> 31:12.103
Why were you in my closet?

31:12.303 --> 31:13.438
Do you go in there a lot?

31:13.638 --> 31:14.306
I never go in there.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.540
Except you do.

31:15.740 --> 31:16.575
No, today I did.

31:16.775 --> 31:18.977
Oh, today.
But never before.

31:19.177 --> 31:20.245
Not in years.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.279
Sure.

31:21.479 --> 31:22.114
Brady.

31:22.314 --> 31:23.649
Mommy?
Brady.

31:23.849 --> 31:25.517
I know my fucking name!

31:25.717 --> 31:27.185
Why do you have this mask?

31:27.385 --> 31:31.156
Why do you think it's okay
to violate my privacy?

31:31.356 --> 31:32.124
Why do you have this mask?

31:32.324 --> 31:36.862
Because, you know, I've long
dreamed of joining the circus.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.798
The smell of peanuts and elephant dung

31:39.998 --> 31:40.599
and chimpanzee sweat,

31:40.799 --> 31:42.934
boy, that's the life for me.

31:43.134 --> 31:44.870
You know,
perhaps I'll find me a missus...

31:45.070 --> 31:49.074
oh, a Russian trapeze artist
or a kindly bearded lady,

31:49.274 --> 31:50.876
and we'll produce a warm-hearted brood

31:51.076 --> 31:51.810
of bearded children.

31:52.010 --> 31:54.346
And great gosh almighty,
we'll live out our days

31:54.546 --> 31:56.948
traversing the land with our circus,

31:57.148 --> 31:59.067
and good cheer dispensing joy

31:59.267 --> 32:00.986
on town upon grateful town.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.821
And all will be right as the rain.

32:03.021 --> 32:05.624
A-yup!

32:05.824 --> 32:09.361
You're not gonna tell me about the mask?

32:09.561 --> 32:11.029
But I just did.

32:11.229 --> 32:12.497
Fair enough.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.966
I shouldn't have snooped in your room.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.704
I would not recommend doing so again,
no.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.843
It's funny to you.

32:59.043 --> 33:01.546
A little, yeah.

33:03.748 --> 33:05.550
I was such a dramatic
child back then.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.056
What did this mean again?

33:12.256 --> 33:13.491
You know what it meant.

33:13.691 --> 33:15.894
Refresh me.

33:21.566 --> 33:24.336
"Die, Motherfuckers, Die."

33:27.772 --> 33:29.641
They wanted me to commit you, Brady,

33:29.841 --> 33:30.642
to send you away.

33:30.842 --> 33:33.211
You couldn't afford it.
I loved you.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.580
That's why all Americans

33:35.780 --> 33:37.983
deserve proper health coverage, y'all.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.451
I didn't commit you

33:39.651 --> 33:40.852
because you told me you could change.

33:41.052 --> 33:42.921
Because you couldn't afford it!

33:43.121 --> 33:46.157
Because you told me you could change.

33:46.357 --> 33:47.442
And I did.

33:47.642 --> 33:48.527
Did you?

33:48.727 --> 33:51.129
That's 10 years old.
I have a good job now.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.064
I have a good life.

33:53.264 --> 33:53.732
Did you?

33:53.932 --> 33:56.401
I did. I certainly did.

33:56.601 --> 33:59.070
Don't you think I did?

34:01.539 --> 34:02.808
I don't know.

34:03.008 --> 34:05.076
Clearly not,
if you're snooping around my room.

34:06.411 --> 34:08.346
This isn't about that anymore.

34:08.545 --> 34:11.081
But it kind of is.

34:11.282 --> 34:13.818
This is about...

34:14.018 --> 34:15.887
Look at me.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.558
Look at me.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.234
What do you want to know, Mommy?

34:30.235 --> 34:32.036
Just ask.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.306
Now's the time.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.574
Here I am, right in front of you.

34:38.976 --> 34:42.047
What do you want to know?

34:45.250 --> 34:48.319
Have you changed?

34:53.391 --> 34:57.462
From the soles of my shoes...

34:57.662 --> 34:59.197
to the crown of my head.

35:32.296 --> 35:34.965
When were you going to wake me?

35:35.165 --> 35:37.835
When the eggs were done.

35:39.436 --> 35:42.906
Morning.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.042
You okay?

35:49.379 --> 35:51.581
You're a god.

35:51.781 --> 35:53.984
That's right.

36:03.927 --> 36:05.663
I couldn't find any juice.

36:05.863 --> 36:09.933
I'm not really a juice girl.

36:10.133 --> 36:14.204
Ahh, I'm not really a juice guy.

36:14.404 --> 36:15.472
Fuck juice.

36:15.672 --> 36:19.076
What'd juice ever do for anybody?

36:22.012 --> 36:25.482
Um... listen, I was thinking.

36:25.682 --> 36:27.351
Uh-huh.

36:27.551 --> 36:31.488
Maybe after the funeral and everything,

36:31.688 --> 36:34.558
I could take you away somewhere

36:34.758 --> 36:37.728
just to let you catch your breath,

36:37.928 --> 36:40.814
get a chance to grieve properly.

36:41.014 --> 36:43.901
I'm going back to California.

36:46.436 --> 36:47.438
When?

36:47.638 --> 36:49.690
As soon as possible.

36:49.890 --> 36:51.942
A few days, maybe.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.512
Yeah?

36:55.712 --> 36:58.649
Lovely, yeah.

36:58.849 --> 37:01.719
Sure, that makes sense

37:01.919 --> 37:04.054
if that's what you've got to do.

37:06.590 --> 37:09.926
I-I still want you to stay on the case.

37:10.126 --> 37:13.463
I still want to receive reports and...

37:13.663 --> 37:15.199
Yeah, of course.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.668
Right.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.006
I mean...

37:22.206 --> 37:24.541
not that it's not...

37:26.410 --> 37:27.344
Not?

37:27.544 --> 37:31.482
I... I mean, of course,

37:31.682 --> 37:33.283
If I stay, I'll fall in love.

37:33.483 --> 37:35.785
And... And I'm...

37:35.985 --> 37:38.088
I'm past that.

37:38.288 --> 37:41.959
That was another girl, another life.

37:45.095 --> 37:46.563
Do you not want that girl back?

37:46.763 --> 37:50.634
That girl got so lost...

37:50.834 --> 37:53.837
that she allowed, even welcomed,

37:54.037 --> 37:55.439
a lot of abuse from someone

37:55.639 --> 37:56.840
who made her wonder

37:57.040 --> 37:59.376
if she was worthy of being loved

37:59.576 --> 38:00.644
or... or even liked.

38:00.844 --> 38:05.182
Made her wonder some nights if the world

38:05.382 --> 38:08.185
would be a... a better place
without her on it.

38:08.385 --> 38:11.188
I-I don't ever want to see
that fucking girl again.

38:28.939 --> 38:30.741
Ta-da.

38:33.677 --> 38:35.746
Thank you.

38:35.946 --> 38:37.681
You're welcome.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.201
For none of us liveth to himself,

39:31.401 --> 39:35.405
and no man dieth to himself.

39:35.605 --> 39:39.642
For if we live, we live unto the Lord,

39:39.842 --> 39:43.880
and if we die, we die unto the Lord.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.982
Therefore, we will not fear,

39:46.182 --> 39:47.885
though the Earth be moved

39:48.085 --> 39:50.954
and though the hills
be carried into the sea.

39:51.154 --> 39:53.523
Before the mountains were brought forth

39:53.723 --> 39:56.093
or ever the Earth and world were made,

39:56.293 --> 39:58.161
Thou art God from everlasting,

39:58.361 --> 40:01.165
and world without end.

40:01.365 --> 40:02.966
For a thousand years in Thy sight

40:03.166 --> 40:07.571
are but as yesterday when it has passed,

40:07.771 --> 40:10.240
and as a watch in the night.

40:10.440 --> 40:14.845
For we consume away in Thy displeasure

40:15.045 --> 40:18.615
and are afraid
at Thy wrathful indignation.

40:18.815 --> 40:22.186
Thou hast set our misdeeds before Thee,

40:22.386 --> 40:26.857
and our secret sins in the light
of Thy countenance.

40:27.057 --> 40:30.194
So teach us to number our days,

40:30.394 --> 40:34.998
that we may apply
our hearts unto wisdom.

40:37.134 --> 40:38.468
Amen.

40:38.668 --> 40:40.537
Amen.

40:42.272 --> 40:45.075
And now, Elizabeth's daughter, Janelle,

40:45.275 --> 40:48.678
would like to say a few words
about her mother.

41:30.253 --> 41:31.788
You okay?

41:31.988 --> 41:33.457
It's all right. Oh!

41:33.657 --> 41:34.258
Okay.

41:34.458 --> 41:35.459
Yeah. Sorry.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.061
It's all right. Sit down here.

41:38.261 --> 41:40.664
Nice and easy, okay? I got you.

41:40.864 --> 41:41.398
Sorry.

41:41.598 --> 41:43.233
It's all right.

41:43.433 --> 41:45.068
Poor thing.

41:47.170 --> 41:48.672
Sorry.

41:48.872 --> 41:50.407
I told you to eat
the oatmeal this morning,

41:50.607 --> 41:53.009
but you turned your nose up at it.

41:53.209 --> 41:53.943
And now look.

41:54.143 --> 41:54.678
I'm fine.

41:54.878 --> 41:56.213
I think she's going to be okay.

41:56.413 --> 41:57.314
No, I'm fine.

41:57.514 --> 42:00.751
Because it's all about you again.

42:00.951 --> 42:04.754
Even at your aunt's funeral,
it's now all about you.

42:04.954 --> 42:06.089
Charlotte.

42:06.289 --> 42:07.424
I just can't.

42:10.494 --> 42:12.762
Can I ride home with you?

42:14.164 --> 42:16.099
Well, I don't know. Uh...

42:18.635 --> 42:19.369
Why not?

42:21.171 --> 42:23.373
I think that's just a splendid idea.

42:28.845 --> 42:31.114
Ahh.

42:34.451 --> 42:36.720
Damn, I think that kinda
worked out okay.

42:36.920 --> 42:38.922
I know.

42:39.122 --> 42:40.390
Did you do that on purpose?

42:40.590 --> 42:42.592
Did ya?
No.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.794
How are you feeling?

42:46.997 --> 42:48.398
I'm feeling a little better.

42:48.598 --> 42:49.866
Yeah?

42:50.066 --> 42:50.867
Yeah, a little.

42:51.067 --> 42:53.403
Just take a minute.
Here, I'll grab the car.

42:53.603 --> 42:55.071
No, that's okay. I'll do it.

42:59.943 --> 43:00.477
The caterer.

43:00.677 --> 43:02.028
Just...

43:02.228 --> 43:03.380
Yeah?

43:03.580 --> 43:05.165
...tell him we're on the way

43:05.365 --> 43:06.950
Aw, Jesus. Let me talk to him.

43:07.150 --> 43:09.019
Give it!

43:53.463 --> 43:55.665
Is your mom always so much fun?

44:38.975 --> 44:40.644
Whew.

44:43.446 --> 44:45.181
Get back in the church!

45:23.019 --> 45:27.890
My mother believed in life after death,

45:28.090 --> 45:32.962
but she didn't believe
in time after death.

45:33.162 --> 45:36.399
Time, she felt, was a human construct.

45:36.599 --> 45:39.836
In Heaven,
there was no before, no after,

45:40.036 --> 45:42.639
no waiting, no... no clocks.

45:42.839 --> 45:46.893
We're already there, she'd say,

45:47.093 --> 45:50.947
and all those who came before us

45:51.147 --> 45:53.583
and all those who haven't been born yet.

45:56.853 --> 45:59.723
I asked her once,

45:59.923 --> 46:01.391
"What does this Heaven look like?"

46:01.591 --> 46:04.060
And she said, "Willow Lake."

46:06.129 --> 46:08.465
Willow Lake, it's in the Berkshires.

46:08.665 --> 46:11.134
It's an hour from where
my mother grew up,

46:11.334 --> 46:15.738
and her family would ski there
and summer there.

46:15.938 --> 46:21.945
The house had wide plank floors
the color of honey and

46:22.145 --> 46:27.016
the shingles weathered so gray
they were almost white.

46:27.216 --> 46:32.088
In a winter squall,
the place would seem to disappear.

46:32.288 --> 46:35.358
My sister and I went there
a few times

46:35.558 --> 46:36.626
as little girls,

46:36.826 --> 46:42.165
and the house smelled
like afghans and...wet sand,

46:42.365 --> 46:44.567
musty window screens...

46:48.772 --> 46:52.242
a roast in the oven.

46:52.442 --> 46:56.145
And my mother's there now...

46:56.345 --> 47:00.049
afghan covering her legs,

47:00.249 --> 47:02.852
fire going.

47:03.052 --> 47:05.455
And my...

47:05.655 --> 47:09.726
father's there...

47:09.926 --> 47:14.330
and my sister and all our ancestors.

47:16.065 --> 47:19.269
And I'm there.

47:19.469 --> 47:20.604
Yep.

47:20.804 --> 47:24.741
All of you come to visit
from time to time.

47:24.941 --> 47:27.243
My mother would like that.

47:27.443 --> 47:29.746
My mother does like that.

47:31.481 --> 47:33.950
She said to me once,

47:34.150 --> 47:38.288
"It's all a beautiful accident, Janey,

47:38.488 --> 47:41.024
who we meet, who we love,

47:41.224 --> 47:43.827
who we're loved by.

47:45.695 --> 47:49.632
And t-this life, it's our dream
and it's God's dream, too.

47:49.832 --> 47:53.603
And then...we wake up."

47:53.803 --> 47:57.374
My mother's awake now.

47:57.574 --> 48:00.176
She has the softest smile on her face.
