02:29.756 --> 02:30.992
Mommy?

02:33.160 --> 02:34.662
Mommy?

03:24.844 --> 03:26.413
Mommy?

03:45.631 --> 03:47.434
Matthew!

03:52.905 --> 03:56.106
Sophie! No! Don't look!
Close your eyes!

07:06.900 --> 07:09.167
Hello?

07:09.169 --> 07:13.140
No, no, I'm fine, I'm just...
I'm just running.

07:15.141 --> 07:19.209
Okay... okay, I'm on my way.

07:19.211 --> 07:22.247
<i>The first
diagnosis is a delusional disorder.</i>

07:22.249 --> 07:26.750
<i>If the subject believes it to be
real, whether imagined or not,</i>

07:26.752 --> 07:29.353
<i>the delusion exists
and should be treated as real.</i>

07:29.355 --> 07:32.692
This is the first step
in a successful diagnosis.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.175
You with the crime scene?

07:50.177 --> 07:52.313
Dr. Fuller, psychologist.

07:54.980 --> 07:57.117
- Dr. Fuller?
- Uh-huh.

07:58.919 --> 08:01.920
Helena Wynsfield.
Murdered her husband.

08:01.922 --> 08:05.423
We just need to evaluate
her state of mind.

08:05.425 --> 08:08.963
Should be easy...
even for a rookie.

08:14.234 --> 08:16.804
Matthew Wynsfield, 43.

08:19.071 --> 08:20.738
Why are you showing me this?

08:20.740 --> 08:23.141
Because before you make the call
whether Mrs. Wynsfield

08:23.143 --> 08:25.043
is going to the court
or the nut house,

08:25.045 --> 08:27.280
you need to understand the reality
of what we're dealing with.

08:40.025 --> 08:42.226
What'chu got?

08:42.227 --> 08:45.165
I don't know. Taka...

08:46.800 --> 08:48.035
Takahas?

09:04.450 --> 09:06.086
Mrs. Wynsfield?

09:09.856 --> 09:11.225
Can you hear me?

09:19.966 --> 09:21.032
Where is the daughter?

09:21.034 --> 09:23.368
Upstairs with her grandpa.

09:23.370 --> 09:25.172
She's not talkin' either.

09:29.108 --> 09:30.477
Come in.

09:34.280 --> 09:38.015
Hello. Is Sophie here?

09:38.017 --> 09:39.452
She's under the bed.

09:40.987 --> 09:43.321
Shouldn't you be out
looking for the real killer?

09:43.323 --> 09:46.990
- Excuse me?
- He's a drug addict. His name's Dougie.

09:46.992 --> 09:50.995
I saw Helena and Matthew
with him last week.

09:50.997 --> 09:54.432
Please, sir, I just need
a couple of minutes.

10:02.876 --> 10:05.545
Sophie? Would you like to
come out and chat?

10:09.348 --> 10:12.152
Okay, I'm coming in.

10:19.458 --> 10:23.927
Oh, and who is this
fine-looking gentleman?

10:23.929 --> 10:26.063
Mr. Fluffy Jojo.

10:26.065 --> 10:30.534
Well, hello, it's so lovely
to meet you!

10:30.536 --> 10:33.971
I'd love a picture
for my wall.

10:33.973 --> 10:36.509
How about you draw
Mr. Fluffy for me?

10:42.616 --> 10:48.286
When I was a little girl, I used
to have a hideout just like this.

10:48.288 --> 10:50.224
A place where
no one could find me.

10:51.491 --> 10:55.125
I'd go there
when I wanted to be alone...

10:55.127 --> 11:00.367
when I felt a little sad,
because... my mommy was so sick.

11:02.935 --> 11:05.637
Just like your mommy.

11:05.639 --> 11:12.476
Grandpa said if I talk to you,
you'll take Mommy away.

11:12.478 --> 11:15.113
Well, Grandpa is right
to be worried.

11:15.115 --> 11:17.581
We're all worried.

11:17.583 --> 11:20.054
Did your mommy have to go away?

11:22.354 --> 11:25.322
Yes. She had to go
into the hospital.

11:25.324 --> 11:28.625
- Forever?
- Just until she got better.

11:28.627 --> 11:31.998
Did she get better?

11:34.400 --> 11:36.636
Yes, she got better.

11:38.405 --> 11:41.475
And I want your mommy
to get better, too.

11:42.675 --> 11:44.708
You have to be brave

11:44.710 --> 11:50.148
and tell me anything that
you remember from last night.

11:50.150 --> 11:55.122
If I tell, promise you won't
take Mommy away?

11:57.991 --> 11:59.894
I promise.

12:03.029 --> 12:06.431
I heard scary noises.

12:06.433 --> 12:10.000
I went to see
what was happening, and...

12:10.002 --> 12:13.139
And... what did you see?

12:18.511 --> 12:24.218
Sophie? Who hurt Daddy?

12:31.558 --> 12:33.160
Mara.

12:46.539 --> 12:49.006
Mrs. Wynsfield?

12:49.008 --> 12:50.707
Helena?

12:50.709 --> 12:53.543
I just spoke to Sophie.

12:53.545 --> 12:55.113
Who's Mara?

13:03.689 --> 13:05.756
<i>Matthew was barely sleeping,</i>

13:05.758 --> 13:09.159
he was losing his mind...

13:09.161 --> 13:13.663
and he, he broke down and he, he
said he had a confession, and he...

13:16.269 --> 13:19.640
It's okay, Helena.
Take your time.

13:23.208 --> 13:26.376
He'd said he'd cheated on me,
with a student.

13:26.378 --> 13:27.714
We've got a motive.

13:29.782 --> 13:34.152
Ten years of marriage,
just gone.

13:34.154 --> 13:36.320
I said I wanted a divorce.

13:38.724 --> 13:42.528
He begged me, he begged me to
forgive him but I just, I couldn't!

13:43.762 --> 13:45.732
Not even for Sophie.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.567
And then every time
I looked at her, I just, I...

13:49.569 --> 13:52.072
I felt so guilty.

13:53.740 --> 13:55.405
And now he's dead.

14:01.347 --> 14:03.847
What happened last night,
Helena?

14:09.322 --> 14:12.092
Uh, um...

14:13.358 --> 14:16.360
I... I woke up...

14:16.362 --> 14:18.131
completely paralyzed.

14:19.431 --> 14:22.201
I was pressed down
into the mattress.

14:23.169 --> 14:25.439
There was something evil
in the room.

14:26.639 --> 14:31.245
And then I...
I heard this awful music.

14:32.377 --> 14:36.147
And then I saw it. Her.

14:36.149 --> 14:38.152
As real as you're sitting there.

14:40.420 --> 14:44.491
The sleep demon. Mara.

14:47.459 --> 14:50.096
And there was nothing
I could do.

14:51.631 --> 14:56.767
She climbed up on...
onto his chest and... and...

14:56.769 --> 14:59.137
I know how this sounds!

14:59.139 --> 15:01.739
But I... I swear.

15:01.741 --> 15:03.541
I swear on my daughter's life,

15:03.543 --> 15:05.546
I did not kill my husband!

15:08.448 --> 15:10.413
Oh, she's gone.

15:10.415 --> 15:12.450
Certifiable froot-loop.

15:12.452 --> 15:15.452
Uh, get me your evaluation
by tomorrow morning,

15:15.454 --> 15:17.922
then we can mop this thing up.

15:17.924 --> 15:19.624
Sophie just lost her dad.

15:19.626 --> 15:21.292
I need to be sure
before I commit her mom.

15:21.294 --> 15:24.294
Are you kidding me?
We got two options here:

15:24.296 --> 15:27.731
now, either Mrs. Wynsfield is
insane and a danger to the public,

15:27.733 --> 15:32.302
or she's telling the truth,
and a demon killed her husband.

15:32.304 --> 15:37.807
Now, which one sounds more
plausible to you, Dr. Fuller? Hmm?

15:37.809 --> 15:41.114
Certifiable froot-loop!

16:14.747 --> 16:16.849
I'm sorry, Sophie.

16:40.439 --> 16:42.539
- I love you, Mommy.
- I love you, too.

16:42.541 --> 16:45.778
And what did Grandpa
give you for breakfast? Huh?

16:47.280 --> 16:52.416
Pancakes,
with sugar and chocolate.

16:52.418 --> 16:54.619
- Sugar and chocolate?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:54.621 --> 16:56.721
That is naughty.

16:56.723 --> 16:58.889
That is not good. And you
got your little pizza in?

16:58.891 --> 17:00.291
Mmm-hmm.

17:06.732 --> 17:07.934
Good girl.

17:12.704 --> 17:15.538
Oh, could you give her a little more
time please, she's with her daughter.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.275
No can do. Running late.

17:17.277 --> 17:19.576
I gotta get home.

17:19.578 --> 17:22.046
Mrs. Wynsfield,
I'm sorry, but time is up.

17:22.048 --> 17:23.445
Can you come with me?
Please come with me.

17:23.448 --> 17:26.348
What is this? No!
Get off of me! No!

17:27.819 --> 17:29.019
I'm innocent,
I didn't do anything!

17:36.762 --> 17:38.596
- Mommy!
- I'm so sorry.

17:40.032 --> 17:42.400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

17:42.402 --> 17:44.301
- You promised!
- I'm sorry.

17:44.303 --> 17:46.636
You promised!

17:46.638 --> 17:47.773
Mommy!

20:02.774 --> 20:06.176
<i>The commerce department
said new home sales increased 3.1%...</i>

20:39.578 --> 20:44.818
"Takahashi knows more,
one-nine-six-six Grange Avenue."

21:41.874 --> 21:43.210
Hello?

21:51.617 --> 21:52.985
Mr. Takahashi?

21:55.320 --> 21:56.689
Hello?

22:40.765 --> 22:42.601
Mr. Takahashi?

23:24.743 --> 23:26.045
Mr. Takahashi?

24:22.801 --> 24:24.233
Who was he?

24:24.235 --> 24:28.439
Don't know.
Not a registered US citizen.

24:28.441 --> 24:30.708
These injuries match those
of the Wynsfield murder.

24:30.710 --> 24:33.277
Whoa, whoa... Now there are
similarities, granted,

24:33.279 --> 24:36.814
but nothing solid enough
to suggest the same killer.

24:36.816 --> 24:38.082
What about the picture?

24:38.084 --> 24:39.950
This guy died over a week ago.

24:39.952 --> 24:42.885
Now what's to say Helena
didn't kill them both?

24:42.887 --> 24:45.788
What? There's no way
Helena did this!

24:45.790 --> 24:47.490
Twisted a guy's head around?

24:47.492 --> 24:49.292
What about this
Dougie character?

24:49.294 --> 24:51.428
- We need to question him...
- We?

24:51.430 --> 24:54.030
Let me remind you
of our roles here, Dr. Fuller;

24:54.032 --> 24:57.300
you're the psychologist,
I'm the detective.

24:57.302 --> 25:00.403
I do the detective work,
plain and simple.

25:00.405 --> 25:04.010
- But I have to put this right...
- Thank you, Dr. Fuller.

25:47.886 --> 25:49.155
Hello, Helena.

26:01.099 --> 26:04.803
Helena, do you know
a Hideo Takahashi?

26:09.140 --> 26:12.175
Your father told me
about someone called Dougie.

26:12.177 --> 26:13.812
A drug addict?

26:21.553 --> 26:22.888
Look...

26:25.323 --> 26:27.423
when I was
around Sophie's age,

26:27.425 --> 26:30.394
my mom started acting strange.

26:30.396 --> 26:34.096
She thought the TV
was talking to her,

26:34.098 --> 26:36.532
and the government
was spying on her.

26:36.534 --> 26:41.538
She went out and bought
this cheap plastic ornament,

26:41.540 --> 26:44.240
a Chinese beckoning cat.

26:44.242 --> 26:49.048
She really, really believed
it would protect her.

26:50.515 --> 26:52.017
It didn't.

26:54.286 --> 26:58.154
Around six months later she was
diagnosed with schizophrenia.

26:58.156 --> 27:03.163
My dad couldn't cope.
He had her committed.

27:06.365 --> 27:11.337
And, three weeks later,
she hung herself.

27:13.305 --> 27:16.476
All I have left of her
is that stupid cat.

27:18.376 --> 27:21.548
My mom is the reason
I became a psychologist.

27:23.514 --> 27:26.118
I know what
Sophie's going through.

27:28.587 --> 27:32.525
I made a mistake, Helena,
and I want to fix it.

27:34.126 --> 27:36.061
Please help me make it right.

27:44.168 --> 27:50.342
Uh... Matthew always had
a sleep problem.

27:54.113 --> 27:57.150
I wanted to help him,
so I... I...

27:58.517 --> 28:03.153
I found a support group
for sufferers in the city,

28:03.155 --> 28:05.489
run by a Dr. Ellis.

28:05.491 --> 28:08.291
Like a...
an Alcoholics Anonymous

28:08.293 --> 28:11.961
for people who suffer
sleep paralysis.

28:11.963 --> 28:16.066
Is, is that where you met
Takahashi and Dougie?

28:16.068 --> 28:18.468
Meeting other sufferers
really helped Matthew.

28:18.470 --> 28:22.306
He... he came home, he was...
he was feeling much better.

28:22.308 --> 28:27.076
But that night, he...
he woke up paralyzed,

28:27.078 --> 28:30.212
a red mark in his eye.

28:30.214 --> 28:32.351
Then things took a turn
for the worse.

28:34.453 --> 28:36.122
He saw her.

28:40.192 --> 28:43.125
It's okay.

28:43.127 --> 28:46.229
Please, let me go home
and see Sophie, please!

28:46.231 --> 28:50.599
I promise you,
we will find Matthew's killer.

28:50.601 --> 28:54.637
I told you! My husband
was killed by a sleep demon!

28:54.639 --> 28:57.007
Helena...
Helena, listen to yourself...

28:57.009 --> 28:58.411
Look!

29:00.111 --> 29:01.577
She marked me!

29:01.579 --> 29:06.215
She's pure evil,
and she's coming for me!

29:06.217 --> 29:09.051
And if you don't get me
out of here soon,

29:09.053 --> 29:13.292
I will die here, alone.

29:15.527 --> 29:17.297
Please...

29:23.402 --> 29:27.003
<i>There are
three states of being:</i>

29:27.005 --> 29:31.240
awake, asleep,

29:31.242 --> 29:35.711
and somewhere in between.

29:35.713 --> 29:38.280
When coming in and out
of REM sleep,

29:38.282 --> 29:41.351
a hormone is released
into the brain.

29:41.353 --> 29:45.555
This suppresses all body-motor
function, paralyzing the sleeper.

29:45.557 --> 29:47.524
It's actually a handy
little trick of nature;

29:47.526 --> 29:50.126
prevents us from
acting out our dreams.

29:50.128 --> 29:56.199
Some people wake up while in this
state, paralyzed but fully aware.

29:56.201 --> 29:59.702
Some people suffer hallucinations,
waking nightmares.

29:59.704 --> 30:05.608
Almost everyone in their lifetime
will experience sleep paralysis.

30:05.610 --> 30:07.411
And no one
talks about it

30:07.413 --> 30:12.585
because of the stigma of
insanity, but crazy you are not.

30:14.219 --> 30:17.186
So these sessions are here
to provide a forum for people

30:17.188 --> 30:19.388
to speak openly
about their experiences.

30:19.390 --> 30:22.459
So, it's over to you.

30:22.461 --> 30:24.294
Let's hear some of your stories.

30:24.296 --> 30:29.399
I was having a bad nightmare...
the old dream.

30:29.401 --> 30:31.434
I must've been trying
to fight it, 'cause...

30:31.436 --> 30:34.304
When I woke up
I was paralyzed,

30:34.306 --> 30:37.774
and there was something
on my chest. I couldn't move...

30:37.776 --> 30:41.414
...like there was something
in my room... watching me.

30:42.614 --> 30:44.681
- Something evil.
- ...evil.

30:44.683 --> 30:48.317
The Devil. Satan.

30:48.319 --> 30:50.854
I... I couldn't see it...

30:50.856 --> 30:53.693
...but, but it.
It, it was there.

30:56.095 --> 31:00.797
She's here now. She's in
this room watching us.

31:03.801 --> 31:05.737
I see her when I'm awake.

31:08.406 --> 31:10.510
When I'm not paralyzed.

31:11.809 --> 31:16.214
At home... at my church...

31:17.549 --> 31:21.852
Here, now, stalking me.

31:21.854 --> 31:25.091
Saul, who are you talking about?

31:29.427 --> 31:32.229
Haggard old woman,
sent by Satan.

31:32.231 --> 31:34.297
- Mara.
- Dougie please, not again.

31:34.299 --> 31:35.798
Can we let Saul speak?

31:35.800 --> 31:40.136
I swear to God almighty...
she's a demon!

31:40.138 --> 31:42.439
Sent to claim my soul
from Satan!

31:42.441 --> 31:46.675
Saul, whatever you do,
do not sleep!

31:46.677 --> 31:48.246
Dougie, please.

31:50.581 --> 31:54.483
When we come in out of
deep sleep in a sleep paralysis,

31:54.485 --> 31:57.753
sometimes we take
our nightmares with us, okay?

31:57.755 --> 31:59.455
What you saw
was a hallucination.

31:59.457 --> 32:00.891
It's a ghost...

32:00.893 --> 32:03.326
It was no hallucination!

32:03.328 --> 32:05.162
It was the Devil incarnate!

32:05.164 --> 32:08.899
Saul, I'm warning you,
you are in grave danger.

32:08.901 --> 32:11.867
Enough, Dougie, you're scaring him!
It's not real, Saul.

32:11.869 --> 32:13.836
Bullshit!

32:13.838 --> 32:15.207
Dougie.

32:16.742 --> 32:19.308
Saul, Saul...

32:19.310 --> 32:22.612
if you sleep tonight,
you will die.

32:22.614 --> 32:24.713
Dougie!

32:24.715 --> 32:27.352
Please, okay...

32:29.253 --> 32:32.189
Look at this. He's cursed!

32:32.191 --> 32:34.457
Hey! Hey!

32:34.459 --> 32:35.925
Okay, let's all just calm down.

32:35.927 --> 32:37.560
There are no such thing
as curses.

32:37.562 --> 32:41.230
Oh, really? And how the fuck
would you know?

32:41.232 --> 32:43.465
Saul, listen to me,
you see her when you're awake,

32:43.467 --> 32:46.236
and that means
you're in the final stage!

32:46.238 --> 32:49.239
When you get home tonight,
you turn on all the lights.

32:49.241 --> 32:51.508
You get an alarm code,
you get 50 alarm codes!

32:51.510 --> 32:53.943
You get the music,
and you blast it up loud!

32:53.945 --> 32:57.681
You do whatever it is
you need to do to stay awake!

32:57.683 --> 32:59.516
Or you will die tonight!

32:59.518 --> 33:02.986
Oh, God, please don't let...
put their hands on me!

33:02.988 --> 33:07.324
You see this?
This is bullshit!

33:07.326 --> 33:11.394
Mara is real.
She is very, very real,

33:11.396 --> 33:14.763
and she will kill
each and every one of us!

33:14.765 --> 33:20.569
You mark my words,
tonight, Saul dies!

33:20.571 --> 33:21.871
Yo, that is enough!

33:23.875 --> 33:25.744
This is bullshit!

33:27.546 --> 33:29.915
I'm sorry, you okay?
You all right?

33:46.330 --> 33:49.499
You're not listening to me!
Dougie said Saul would die!

33:49.501 --> 33:52.001
Tonight!
That's a real threat, right?

33:52.003 --> 33:53.769
- Mm-mm.
- Maybe Dougie's our killer!

33:53.771 --> 33:57.339
If you get a lead you come to me,
you don't follow it up yourself.

33:57.341 --> 33:59.608
I've just separated
a mother and daughter.

33:59.610 --> 34:02.511
You may not get
how awful that is, but I do.

34:02.513 --> 34:03.946
So, I will put this right.

34:03.948 --> 34:07.750
Enough! Go home now,
while I'm still being nice,

34:07.752 --> 34:11.755
or I will personally see to it that this
is the last homicide case you ever work.

34:26.004 --> 34:30.873
<i>You have
one message. Tuesday, 8:28pm.</i>

34:30.876 --> 34:33.409
<i>Kate, she's getting closer.</i>

34:33.411 --> 34:36.446
<i>I have to see Sophie, please...
to say goodbye...</i>

34:36.447 --> 34:40.350
<i>You put me in here.
Please just, just get me out!</i>

34:46.792 --> 34:48.857
<i>All lines are currently closed.</i>

34:48.859 --> 34:52.563
<i>Patient phone hours
are from 9am to 5pm.</i>

35:19.591 --> 35:22.591
Lord, give us this day
our daily bread,

35:22.593 --> 35:24.894
and forgive us our trespasses,

35:24.896 --> 35:28.064
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

35:28.066 --> 35:31.968
Thine is the power
of the grace of the Lord,

35:31.970 --> 35:34.906
forever and ever. Amen.

35:51.122 --> 35:55.760
Jesus, God... purify me!

36:20.551 --> 36:22.521
Purify me, your servant.

36:24.622 --> 36:27.092
This is my journey toward you.

36:29.593 --> 36:34.432
<i>Father who art in Heaven,
deliver me from evil.</i>

36:47.778 --> 36:49.779
Lord forgive me.

38:35.653 --> 38:37.787
Hello?

38:37.789 --> 38:40.959
<i>Dr. Fuller.
What's the matter, you okay?</i>

38:42.160 --> 38:43.792
<i>I'm okay, yeah.</i>

38:43.794 --> 38:46.296
<i>Must've been a bad dream.
I just woke up.</i>

38:46.298 --> 38:48.064
<i>This Dougie character,</i>

38:48.066 --> 38:49.899
<i>did you say he threatened
a man named Saul?</i>

38:49.901 --> 38:52.701
Yes. Why?

38:52.703 --> 38:55.006
'Cause I'm with Saul right now.

39:00.946 --> 39:05.147
Found him living in a dilapidated
shack over on Killhope Island.

39:05.149 --> 39:09.618
Living in the middle of nowhere,
a real hermit.

39:09.620 --> 39:10.953
What did he say?

39:10.955 --> 39:14.122
Not a damn thing.

39:14.124 --> 39:17.727
Figured you could do some,
uh, psychology on him.

39:17.729 --> 39:20.129
Maybe get him to admit
to knowing the victims.

39:20.131 --> 39:23.732
- About before, I... I'm sorry...
- Listen.

39:23.734 --> 39:25.667
What you did
was against procedure.

39:25.669 --> 39:27.039
It was reckless and stupid.

39:32.010 --> 39:33.642
But it did lead to an arrest,

39:33.644 --> 39:37.282
so, let's just consider
the matter closed, all right?

39:41.218 --> 39:46.955
Now...
let's go nail this lowlife.

39:46.957 --> 39:50.892
Time is 15:32, 12th of November.

39:50.894 --> 39:53.328
This is
Lieutenant Mike McCarthy.

39:53.330 --> 39:57.633
Also present is forensic psychologist, Dr.
Kate Fuller.

39:57.635 --> 40:00.138
Suspect is Dougie Trenton.

40:02.807 --> 40:06.743
Mr. Trenton, do you know
a Mr. Takahashi?

40:06.745 --> 40:08.080
No comment.

40:09.414 --> 40:11.381
Matthew Wynsfield?

40:11.383 --> 40:13.281
No comment.

40:13.283 --> 40:15.752
Saul Conlan?

40:15.754 --> 40:18.321
No comment.

40:18.323 --> 40:19.992
Dougie,
did you kill these people?

40:26.731 --> 40:29.265
No... comment.

40:29.267 --> 40:33.169
Yesterday several witnesses heard
you say that Saul was going to die.

40:33.171 --> 40:35.805
And just like you said, he died.

40:35.807 --> 40:39.008
I didn't kill him. I warned him.

40:39.010 --> 40:40.979
Warned him of what?

40:43.948 --> 40:45.850
This is going nowhere.

40:51.156 --> 40:53.790
Mara.

40:53.792 --> 40:55.758
Tell me about Mara.

40:55.760 --> 40:59.095
You're not the first person
to talk about her.

40:59.097 --> 41:00.999
Help me understand.

41:03.368 --> 41:05.371
I can help you
but you have to talk.

41:06.838 --> 41:09.040
Did you know Mr. Takahashi?

41:16.781 --> 41:18.717
I met him at the group sessions.

41:20.151 --> 41:22.484
He was the first person
to see her.

41:24.189 --> 41:27.660
I mean, I thought...
I thought he was nuts.

41:29.060 --> 41:32.962
But that night,
she came to me, too.

41:32.964 --> 41:37.703
We started looking into it...
Takahashi and me.

41:40.171 --> 41:42.741
You would not believe
the shit that we found.

41:44.341 --> 41:47.375
Mara...

41:47.377 --> 41:51.113
Mara has been killing people
since the dawn of time.

41:51.115 --> 41:56.120
- Did you kill Mr. Takahashi?!
- No... I didn't.

42:00.925 --> 42:04.259
Matthew Wynsfield,
did you know him?

42:04.261 --> 42:07.865
Yeah. And his wife Helena.

42:08.867 --> 42:11.234
But he was marked.

42:11.236 --> 42:12.468
Marked?

42:12.470 --> 42:14.707
Marked, like this!

42:17.075 --> 42:20.343
Oh, I told him,
I warned him, do not sleep!

42:20.345 --> 42:23.044
But he didn't listen.

42:23.046 --> 42:25.149
But once you're marked,
that's it.

42:26.450 --> 42:27.885
It's over.

42:33.124 --> 42:37.026
So this demon,
she marks you first,

42:37.028 --> 42:38.763
and then she kills you?

42:40.430 --> 42:43.232
Yes.

42:43.234 --> 42:46.201
So how come they're all dead,
but you're still alive?

42:46.203 --> 42:47.537
Fuck you.

42:47.539 --> 42:49.171
You know what, I knew this.

42:49.173 --> 42:50.573
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

42:50.575 --> 42:52.241
You want to know what I believe?

42:52.243 --> 42:55.076
I believe you're the only
suspect in three murders!

42:55.078 --> 42:58.117
Suspect all you want, detective.

42:59.383 --> 43:03.155
But you do not have
a single shred of evidence.

43:04.222 --> 43:06.425
- Dougie...
- No comment.

43:12.129 --> 43:15.430
Well, he's right
about one thing,

43:15.432 --> 43:17.135
all we have is hearsay.

43:18.435 --> 43:20.602
He has no alibi,
but no motive either.

43:20.604 --> 43:22.537
Don't look so literally.

43:22.539 --> 43:25.308
Dougie genuinely believes
a demon killed those people.

43:25.310 --> 43:27.475
What if that demon was him?

43:27.477 --> 43:29.412
Another aspect
of his personality.

43:29.414 --> 43:32.314
Still, without any physical
evidence I can't make an arrest.

43:32.316 --> 43:36.287
But we'll keep tabs on him.
He'll slip up sooner or later.

43:38.923 --> 43:42.625
Well, thanks partly to you
we have a viable suspect.

43:42.627 --> 43:45.493
So, I guess Helena Wynsfield can
go home and be with her daughter.

43:45.495 --> 43:48.133
You want to be the one
to give the good news?

43:54.037 --> 43:56.071
So, normally, we would just
bring the patients

43:56.073 --> 43:57.939
to the visiting area,
you know,

43:57.941 --> 43:59.375
they don't really get many
visitors, just to their rooms.

43:59.377 --> 44:01.176
- Yeah, if I had more time
- I would've arranged...

44:01.178 --> 44:03.011
Oh, no, it's not
a problem at all.

44:03.013 --> 44:05.982
Helena?

44:05.984 --> 44:07.019
Helena, you have a visitor...

44:09.586 --> 44:13.124
Someone help! Here!
Someone help!

44:19.397 --> 44:20.562
Helena?

44:20.564 --> 44:21.997
Call 911!

44:21.999 --> 44:25.303
Helena. Go, go! 911! Go!

47:40.231 --> 47:44.236
"Dougie Trenton, old mower
shack, Killhope Island."

50:42.312 --> 50:44.513
- Dougie...
- Go fuck yourself.

50:44.515 --> 50:47.219
No, wait, wait, wait, wait!
I've seen her, too!

51:09.673 --> 51:12.006
What is all this?

51:12.008 --> 51:13.575
Research.

51:13.577 --> 51:15.977
Oh, did you think
it was just you and me, eh?

51:15.979 --> 51:17.845
I don't know
what to think anymore.

51:17.847 --> 51:19.647
Millions of people
have seen it, Kate.

51:19.649 --> 51:21.482
All over the world.

51:21.484 --> 51:24.386
In Japan,
they call it Kanashibari.

51:24.388 --> 51:26.721
In Zanzibar,
they call her Popobawa.

51:26.723 --> 51:28.790
In Canada, they call her
the Night Hag.

51:28.792 --> 51:32.694
But over here, it's Mara.

51:32.696 --> 51:34.430
She's everywhere;

51:34.432 --> 51:39.567
in medieval literature,
art, the Chinese Book of Dreams!

51:39.569 --> 51:43.071
The first recorded evidence
is 400 B.C.

51:43.073 --> 51:46.410
Think about it,
Mara predates Christ!

51:47.678 --> 51:49.678
And look at this, Fuseli...

51:49.680 --> 51:55.049
Fuseli paints her in 1781. 1781!

51:55.051 --> 51:57.653
There must be some other
explanation for all of this.

51:57.655 --> 51:59.754
Yeah? Like what?

51:59.756 --> 52:01.122
I don't know.

52:01.124 --> 52:02.825
- Hallucinations...
- Hallucinations?

52:02.827 --> 52:04.058
Yes.

52:04.060 --> 52:05.660
Hallucinations.

52:05.662 --> 52:07.796
Okay... see these?

52:07.798 --> 52:10.935
These are just some
of the recent sightings!

52:12.803 --> 52:14.136
And what about...

52:14.138 --> 52:16.071
Takahashi,
what about Helena,

52:16.073 --> 52:18.841
what about Saul,
Matthew, me, you?

52:18.843 --> 52:24.546
If these are hallucinations, Kate,
then how come we all see her?

52:24.548 --> 52:28.649
Mara is real,
and she's killed before.

52:28.651 --> 52:33.388
Look at this, eh...
right here, 1977.

52:33.390 --> 52:36.024
One hundred Hmong refugees
die in their sleep

52:36.026 --> 52:40.028
after experiencing an evil
presence crushing their chest!

52:40.030 --> 52:46.067
And then again, 1983 Thailand, 230
people are found dead in their sleep!

52:46.069 --> 52:51.140
Now, no doctor or psycho-fucking-therapist
can explain these deaths!

52:51.142 --> 52:54.142
And now she's here,
and she's killing again!

52:54.144 --> 52:57.979
So millions see her
but she only kills a few? Why?

52:57.981 --> 53:00.948
I don't know,
I haven't worked this out yet,

53:00.950 --> 53:02.986
but there is
some kind of pattern.

53:05.622 --> 53:09.825
She kills in clusters, always,
after a tragedy or an event.

53:09.827 --> 53:11.859
It's like Mara
is in the spirit world

53:11.861 --> 53:15.696
and the tragedy somehow
brings her into our world.

53:15.698 --> 53:18.734
But there hasn't been
any big tragedy here recently.

53:18.736 --> 53:19.834
Well, then maybe
we've missed it.

53:19.836 --> 53:21.904
How do you miss a tragedy?

53:21.906 --> 53:24.105
I'm sorry, Dougie,
but this is crazy!

53:24.107 --> 53:28.009
Please, you have got
to start believing me!

53:28.011 --> 53:32.147
Listen, you're at stage two!

53:32.149 --> 53:34.216
Stage two, what?

53:34.218 --> 53:37.051
It comes in stages,
I've worked this out.

53:37.053 --> 53:39.555
Look, stage one:

53:39.557 --> 53:41.823
you're paralyzed,
and you see her.

53:41.825 --> 53:45.727
Now, millions of people experience this,
but for some, nothing else happens.

53:45.729 --> 53:48.964
For the unlucky ones like us,
it goes to stage two.

53:48.966 --> 53:52.600
She marks you, red in the eye.
This is where you are, Kate!

53:52.602 --> 53:56.705
Then it moves to stage three,
the physical contact.

53:56.707 --> 54:00.776
She climbs up on your chest, she
places her hands around your throat.

54:00.778 --> 54:02.511
And then it's stage four.

54:02.513 --> 54:04.580
Soon, you'll see her
when you're awake,

54:04.582 --> 54:06.548
she'll be in your waking world.

54:06.550 --> 54:10.488
And the next time you sleep...
you're dead.

54:11.856 --> 54:15.189
Well, if this is true,
how come you're still alive?

54:22.098 --> 54:24.535
I only sleep
for 20 minutes at a time.

54:25.870 --> 54:27.903
I've figured out
that Mara only comes

54:27.905 --> 54:29.638
if you're in a deep sleep.

54:29.640 --> 54:31.506
I set all of the alarms, music,

54:31.508 --> 54:34.575
anything I can,
for 20-minute intervals.

54:34.577 --> 54:36.912
I never sleep
for more than 20 minutes.

54:36.914 --> 54:38.917
And that way she can't
get into my waking world.

54:41.218 --> 54:44.022
Dougie, how long has it been
since you had a proper sleep?

54:46.723 --> 54:47.959
I don't know...

54:49.193 --> 54:52.560
A few weeks, a month...
I can't remember.

54:52.562 --> 54:54.962
Do you realize what effect
that will have on your mind?

54:54.964 --> 54:58.866
Dougie, you're severely
sleep deprived!

54:58.868 --> 55:01.870
All this talk
about sleep demons, and...

55:01.872 --> 55:03.971
Kate... you have to
listen to me, Kate!

55:03.973 --> 55:07.008
Now, you can believe all this
science and this forensic bullshit,

55:07.010 --> 55:10.279
but I am telling you right now,
you are marked!

55:10.281 --> 55:14.786
Our only hope is to figure out what
links us all, or we're all dead!

55:16.252 --> 55:20.888
Kate! Kate! Listen to me!

55:20.890 --> 55:23.091
I'm warning you, do not sleep!

55:23.093 --> 55:25.830
Find the link, Kate,
so we can stop her!

55:36.740 --> 55:39.243
Dr. Ellis?
I need to show you something.

55:45.982 --> 55:48.584
It's like an invisible force
is lifting her up

55:48.586 --> 55:50.852
and slamming her back down,
right?

55:50.854 --> 55:54.622
But nothing supernatural.
Convulsions, a seizure.

55:54.624 --> 55:57.292
What about the mark?
Helena had it and now I do, too.

55:57.294 --> 55:58.696
Mark?

56:05.935 --> 56:09.270
- Just a burst blood vessel.
- No, people have died.

56:09.272 --> 56:14.075
- Can you explain that?
- Not without looking into their individual circumstances, no.

56:14.077 --> 56:15.944
What about the Hmong refugees?

56:15.946 --> 56:17.712
Over a hundred died
in their sleep.

56:17.714 --> 56:19.982
- SUNDS.
- What?

56:19.984 --> 56:22.383
Sudden unexpected
nocturnal death syndrome.

56:22.385 --> 56:25.155
It has nothing to do
with sleep paralysis.

56:27.825 --> 56:30.261
Come here,
I want to show you something.

56:37.100 --> 56:40.368
Most sleep labs are clinical,
like hospitals.

56:40.370 --> 56:43.340
But for more accurate results the
patient should feel more at home.

56:50.747 --> 56:53.180
It's tinted, two-way.

56:53.182 --> 56:55.850
The control room's
on the other side.

56:57.787 --> 56:59.955
Thanks, Carly.

56:59.957 --> 57:03.792
So this is where
we monitor the sleepers.

57:03.794 --> 57:07.863
This is all great, but what does
it have to do with Helena's death?

57:07.865 --> 57:10.298
I was just a kid the first time
I got sleep paralysis.

57:10.300 --> 57:13.334
I swear to God,
Freddy Krueger was in my room.

57:13.336 --> 57:17.171
- For me, it was aliens.
- Ah, the generation gap.

57:17.173 --> 57:20.142
Ever since Roswell,
the whole UFO phenomenon,

57:20.144 --> 57:21.877
alien abductions
have increased tenfold.

57:21.879 --> 57:24.779
You mean since the <i>X-Files.</i>

57:24.781 --> 57:27.249
Uh... sorry,
what are you saying?

57:27.251 --> 57:30.252
It's no coincidence that people
share similar hallucinations.

57:30.254 --> 57:34.288
What we see in sleep paralysis is directly
influenced by the culture around us.

57:34.290 --> 57:36.223
Things that scare us.

57:36.225 --> 57:39.428
For me, it was Freddy Krueger.
In the old days, it was witches.

57:39.430 --> 57:43.999
Fast forward to Mulder and Scully
over here and boom, aliens.

57:44.001 --> 57:45.933
Yeah, but Mara
isn't part of our culture.

57:45.935 --> 57:47.736
Why did I see her?

57:47.738 --> 57:51.105
Simple. Helena told you
her sleep demon story.

57:51.107 --> 57:53.741
It scared you,
stayed with you,

57:53.743 --> 57:55.843
and then you suffer
sleep paralysis, and,

57:55.845 --> 57:58.913
as if by magic,
you see the same thing.

57:58.915 --> 58:03.218
I'm telling you, as a scientific
fact, Mara is not real.

58:03.220 --> 58:05.453
And sleep paralysis cannot kill.

58:07.057 --> 58:09.390
You have nothing to fear.

58:09.392 --> 58:10.827
Thank you, doctor.

59:54.430 --> 59:56.032
<i>Mommy?</i>

01:00:11.448 --> 01:00:12.850
<i>Mommy?</i>

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:13.276
<i>Mommy?</i>

01:01:15.979 --> 01:01:19.317
You left me alone to die!

01:02:59.749 --> 01:03:01.149
<i>Hello?</i>

01:03:01.151 --> 01:03:02.183
Mr. Wynsfield?

01:03:02.185 --> 01:03:03.785
It's Dr. Fuller.

01:03:03.787 --> 01:03:06.520
I just want to check on Sophie.
How is she doing?

01:03:06.522 --> 01:03:10.158
<i>Terrible. She's not
sleeping right, she's having bad dreams.</i>

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.459
<i>It all happened
after you spoke with her.</i>

01:03:12.461 --> 01:03:16.798
<i>She's got it in her head that it was
her fault her mother got locked up.</i>

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.533
I'm so sorry.

01:03:18.535 --> 01:03:21.069
<i>It's the funeral tomorrow,</i>

01:03:21.071 --> 01:03:24.506
<i>please, just leave us alone.</i>

01:03:24.508 --> 01:03:26.243
We are here today to join...

01:04:02.646 --> 01:04:05.613
<i>You have one
new voice message.</i>

01:04:05.615 --> 01:04:09.517
<i>Kate, it's Dougie. I fell
asleep, Kate. I'm on stage four!</i>

01:04:09.519 --> 01:04:12.187
<i>She's here,
I can't sleep, or I am dead!</i>

01:04:12.189 --> 01:04:13.654
<i>You've got to help me, please!</i>

01:04:13.656 --> 01:04:16.026
I'm gonna do something.
Bye, Kate, help me!

01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:37.080
Mustn't sleep...
stay awake...

01:04:39.415 --> 01:04:41.118
Stay awake...

01:04:49.758 --> 01:04:53.627
Stay awake... mustn't sleep.

01:04:53.629 --> 01:04:55.562
Mustn't sleep.

01:04:55.564 --> 01:04:56.830
Mustn't sleep.

01:04:56.832 --> 01:05:00.134
Mustn't sleep. Stay awake...

01:05:00.136 --> 01:05:02.636
Mustn't sleep. Stay awake...

01:05:09.845 --> 01:05:12.247
Dougie? Dougie!

01:05:12.249 --> 01:05:13.714
Dougie!

01:05:13.716 --> 01:05:15.350
Oh, God.

01:05:15.352 --> 01:05:19.620
- Oh, God... God...
- Kate...

01:05:19.622 --> 01:05:20.921
What have you done?

01:05:20.923 --> 01:05:23.924
- What have you done?
- She's coming, please...

01:05:23.926 --> 01:05:25.259
She's coming, please...

01:05:25.261 --> 01:05:26.694
- This is stage four.
- No...

01:05:26.696 --> 01:05:28.566
This is stage four!

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.698
- She's here, Kate!
- No!

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.866
- She's here, Kate!
- There's no one here,

01:05:32.868 --> 01:05:34.701
there's no one here,
it's just me!

01:05:37.874 --> 01:05:40.375
I will, I will, I promise.

01:05:40.377 --> 01:05:42.843
You have to trust me, okay?

01:05:42.845 --> 01:05:44.712
Hold on, just hold on...

01:05:52.222 --> 01:05:53.921
- <i>Kate?</i>
- Dr. Ellis!

01:05:53.923 --> 01:05:56.290
- <i>You okay?</i>
- I need help. Dougie's hurt himself.

01:05:56.292 --> 01:05:59.627
He's on stage four!
And I've seen it!

01:05:59.629 --> 01:06:02.529
<i>Kate, calm down,
just bring him into the clinic!</i>

01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:04.799
<i>I can't understand
what's happening...</i>

01:06:04.801 --> 01:06:07.238
<i>I can help him here,
trust me, I can help him.</i>

01:06:20.749 --> 01:06:23.750
Kate, you're exhausted.
Dougie, too.

01:06:23.752 --> 01:06:26.490
All you need is a good night's sleep
and your problems will be over.

01:06:27.723 --> 01:06:29.325
I hope you're right.

01:06:33.562 --> 01:06:35.763
It'll help calm you.

01:06:35.765 --> 01:06:37.966
Any sign
of anything unusual

01:06:37.968 --> 01:06:41.805
and we'll wake you up
immediately. I promise.

01:06:50.013 --> 01:06:51.682
<i>It's all a waste of time, Kate.</i>

01:06:53.917 --> 01:06:55.917
She's got me beat.

01:06:55.919 --> 01:06:59.623
You're in safe hands now.
Everything is going to be fine.

01:07:00.856 --> 01:07:03.323
I'm right by your side
and I'm not leaving.

01:07:03.325 --> 01:07:07.562
I know why she comes now.
I've worked it out.

01:07:16.539 --> 01:07:18.341
It's the fucking war.

01:07:20.743 --> 01:07:22.780
We were at a checkpoint.

01:07:23.946 --> 01:07:26.881
Everything was on edge.

01:07:26.883 --> 01:07:29.316
We hadn't slept for days.

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:30.917
Dougie, you don't have to...

01:07:30.919 --> 01:07:35.658
Then out of the dust,
a vehicle came toward us. A car.

01:07:39.863 --> 01:07:43.665
I signaled for it to stop,
but...

01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:44.969
it just kept on coming.

01:07:46.403 --> 01:07:49.537
We'd already lost two men,

01:07:49.539 --> 01:07:51.908
I didn't want to lose
anybody else.

01:07:53.676 --> 01:07:56.444
I opened fire.

01:07:56.446 --> 01:08:00.584
Then the car... slowed down...

01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:02.986
it stopped.

01:08:05.088 --> 01:08:07.258
And that's when I heard...

01:08:08.992 --> 01:08:12.495
the crying, and the wailing...

01:08:14.631 --> 01:08:17.600
it was the most haunting sound
I've ever heard.

01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:20.600
Dougie...

01:08:20.602 --> 01:08:24.006
A young woman. A girl.

01:08:26.475 --> 01:08:27.877
A mother...

01:08:31.346 --> 01:08:34.948
she took a bullet to the chest.

01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:37.953
She was bleeding to death.

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:43.627
She was
holding her dead baby.

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:50.700
She looked straight at me...

01:08:52.901 --> 01:08:55.836
Oh, God, forget it, Kate.

01:08:55.837 --> 01:08:58.475
What the fuck did I do?

01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:04.911
The fuck did I do, Kate?

01:09:04.912 --> 01:09:07.948
Hush, Dougie...

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:10.020
Sleep, sleep, Dougie.

01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:13.423
Everything is going to be okay.

01:09:15.624 --> 01:09:16.926
I'm right here.

01:09:19.796 --> 01:09:21.497
Sleep now...

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:55.064
Let's get this show on the road.

01:09:58.802 --> 01:10:01.536
Subject asleep, 23:45.

01:10:01.538 --> 01:10:05.042
Okay, Mara,
let's see what you got.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:53.656
So much for sleep demons.

01:13:40.757 --> 01:13:43.026
Oh, shit!

01:13:46.428 --> 01:13:48.828
Carly!

01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:49.999
Carly!

01:13:55.404 --> 01:13:56.706
Dougie!

01:13:58.074 --> 01:13:59.874
Dougie!

01:13:59.876 --> 01:14:01.408
Christ!

01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:04.247
Dougie! Dougie!

01:14:31.908 --> 01:14:34.075
Wake up! Kate, wake up!

01:14:34.077 --> 01:14:35.710
Kate, wake up!

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:42.316
I was watching...

01:14:42.318 --> 01:14:47.955
No! No, it can't be!
Oh, my God! Oh my God!

01:14:47.957 --> 01:14:51.925
We had him wired,
monitored, I...

01:14:51.927 --> 01:14:55.028
I don't know what this is.

01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:57.167
It's okay, doctor,
take your time.

01:14:58.434 --> 01:15:00.835
I'm a scientist,
I deal with the facts and logic,

01:15:00.837 --> 01:15:02.737
not, not this, this...

01:15:07.443 --> 01:15:08.945
McCarthy.

01:15:10.812 --> 01:15:12.048
Oh, no.

01:15:41.409 --> 01:15:43.077
What happened?

01:15:43.079 --> 01:15:44.879
Last night
she had some sort of fit,

01:15:44.881 --> 01:15:46.115
she stopped breathing.

01:15:48.150 --> 01:15:50.052
Now she's seeing things.

01:15:55.190 --> 01:15:58.060
Hey... hey...

01:16:06.836 --> 01:16:08.405
She's behind you.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.819
Listen, she's in the final stage.
Do not let her sleep.

01:16:24.387 --> 01:16:28.322
Please,
if she sleeps, she will die!

01:16:28.324 --> 01:16:30.393
Get out!

01:16:32.829 --> 01:16:35.298
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:37.065 --> 01:16:39.567
I'll be back, Sophie. I promise.

01:16:39.569 --> 01:16:41.868
Just stay awake.

01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:43.038
Just keep her awake.

01:17:00.355 --> 01:17:01.957
Shit...

01:17:36.158 --> 01:17:38.995
Shit... shit...

01:18:47.629 --> 01:18:49.595
<i>You are marked!</i>

01:18:49.597 --> 01:18:52.433
<i>My husband was killed
by a sleep demon!</i>

01:18:52.435 --> 01:18:54.201
<i>You'll see her
even when you are awake...</i>

01:18:54.203 --> 01:18:56.236
<i>The next time you sleep,
you're dead.</i>

01:19:39.047 --> 01:19:42.251
Taka, Matthew, Saul.

01:19:44.587 --> 01:19:45.622
Helena.

01:19:49.458 --> 01:19:51.191
Dougie.

01:19:51.193 --> 01:19:52.227
Sophie.

01:19:55.397 --> 01:19:58.098
Matthew, Helena, Dougie...

01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.102
What's the link?

01:20:04.774 --> 01:20:08.642
<i>Find the link, Kate,
so we can stop her!</i>

01:20:08.644 --> 01:20:10.810
<i>I'm warning you, do not sleep!</i>

01:20:10.812 --> 01:20:12.082
<i>Sophie...</i>

01:20:16.084 --> 01:20:18.518
Takahashi, Matthew...

01:20:32.068 --> 01:20:33.669
"Lead the way..."

01:20:39.675 --> 01:20:41.177
Oh, Dougie...

01:20:43.111 --> 01:20:44.247
The war.

01:20:46.815 --> 01:20:48.617
Saul's accident.

01:20:52.354 --> 01:20:55.258
Helena? Helena...

01:20:57.693 --> 01:21:00.227
<i>He begged for
me to stay, but I just,</i>

01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:02.728
<i>I couldn't,
not even for Sophie.</i>

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:07.201
<i>I felt so guilty.
And now he's dead.</i>

01:21:07.203 --> 01:21:10.336
You blame yourself
for Matthew's death.

01:21:10.338 --> 01:21:12.708
And I blame myself for yours.

01:21:22.751 --> 01:21:25.088
<i>Saul killed his mom.</i>

01:21:29.557 --> 01:21:31.360
<i>Matthew had an affair.</i>

01:21:33.662 --> 01:21:35.397
<i>Dougie killed in Iraq.</i>

01:21:37.499 --> 01:21:41.770
<i>In every other outbreak,
there was a big tragedy.</i>

01:21:43.372 --> 01:21:45.141
<i>Why not here?</i>

01:21:56.584 --> 01:21:59.853
Takahashi.
What did you do?

01:22:08.564 --> 01:22:09.929
- Hello?
- Takahashi.

01:22:09.931 --> 01:22:11.532
Who is he, what did he do?

01:22:11.534 --> 01:22:13.500
Kate, what...
where the hell are you?

01:22:13.502 --> 01:22:14.768
Listen to me!

01:22:14.770 --> 01:22:16.803
Listen to me,
Takahashi did something!

01:22:16.805 --> 01:22:19.406
Something so big, so awful,
that he caused all this.

01:22:19.408 --> 01:22:22.742
- What did he do?
- Kate, what... what in the hell...

01:22:22.744 --> 01:22:24.480
- Tell me!
- <i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

01:22:25.881 --> 01:22:28.314
Back in Japan, he was a chef
in a primary school.

01:22:28.316 --> 01:22:30.684
<i>He cut a deal
on some cheap food,</i>

01:22:30.686 --> 01:22:36.355
uh, raw fish that
was contaminated, 38 kids died.

01:22:36.357 --> 01:22:37.491
He'd been on the run ever since.

01:22:37.493 --> 01:22:39.358
That's it, that's the tragedy

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.460
- that brought her.
- Brought who?

01:22:41.462 --> 01:22:44.665
Mara! Takahashi went on the run,
ended up here.

01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:48.301
But he felt so bad for what he had
done that his guilt brought Mara out!

01:22:48.303 --> 01:22:50.804
She killed him then spread,
drawn to people's guilt.

01:22:50.806 --> 01:22:54.907
The sleep clinic group,
friends and family... that's it!

01:22:54.909 --> 01:22:57.344
- That's how she works!
- <i>Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...</i>

01:22:57.346 --> 01:22:59.979
You sound like Dougie, what... what
the hell are you talking about?

01:22:59.981 --> 01:23:03.517
Listen to me!
Dougie killed innocents in Iraq,

01:23:03.519 --> 01:23:05.786
Saul killed his mom,
Matthew had an affair,

01:23:05.788 --> 01:23:07.587
Helena blamed herself
for the divorce,

01:23:07.589 --> 01:23:09.923
I had an innocent woman
committed and orphaned Sophie.

01:23:09.925 --> 01:23:12.559
- It's guilt!
- What about Sophie?

01:23:12.561 --> 01:23:15.365
What does an eight-year-old kid
have to feel guilty about?

01:23:16.531 --> 01:23:19.666
- She talked to me.
- <i>What?</i>

01:23:19.668 --> 01:23:24.504
Her grandfather told her that if she
talked to me I would lock her mommy away.

01:23:24.506 --> 01:23:26.607
Sophie blames herself!

01:23:26.609 --> 01:23:28.242
<i>I have to put her right!</i>

01:23:28.244 --> 01:23:29.242
Wait, Kate!

01:23:29.244 --> 01:23:30.777
Sophie's in the final stage!

01:23:30.779 --> 01:23:32.845
Mara is coming for her next!

01:23:32.847 --> 01:23:35.448
I have to tell her that none of
this is her fault. I'm to blame!

01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:37.617
<i>Wait, wait, Kate, wait!</i>

01:23:37.619 --> 01:23:38.820
Dr. Fuller?

01:23:40.756 --> 01:23:41.758
Shit!

01:24:29.504 --> 01:24:30.739
Helena?

01:25:10.111 --> 01:25:14.113
<i>This is the City Cross
Ferry Line, next stop Stanley Park.</i>

01:25:14.115 --> 01:25:16.386
<i>...Memorial Hospital.</i>

01:27:25.614 --> 01:27:28.849
Yes! I wanted to go!

01:27:31.086 --> 01:27:32.954
It was a whole thing.

01:27:34.655 --> 01:27:36.091
You bad boy!

01:29:20.596 --> 01:29:23.796
Sophie... it's Kate, honey.

01:29:23.798 --> 01:29:25.801
There's something
I need to tell you.

01:29:31.873 --> 01:29:34.040
Sophie! Sophie, can you hear me?

01:29:34.042 --> 01:29:37.914
Sophie, you've done nothing wrong,
it was my fault, not yours.

01:29:39.381 --> 01:29:42.282
Soph... wake up!

01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:48.688
No! No! No!

01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:51.023
Don't you touch her! No!

01:29:51.025 --> 01:29:52.725
No, don't you touch her!

01:29:52.727 --> 01:29:55.631
No, don't you touch her!

01:29:57.833 --> 01:29:59.769
I'm the guilty one, not her!

01:30:02.003 --> 01:30:05.971
I'm begging, take me, take me, take me...

01:30:05.973 --> 01:30:09.009
No! No! Wake up, Sophie!

01:30:09.011 --> 01:30:10.276
Wake up!

01:30:10.278 --> 01:30:12.882
Wake up...

01:30:29.030 --> 01:30:32.032
- Sophie! Sophie...
- I don't blame you.

01:30:32.034 --> 01:30:34.937
It's okay. You're innocent, too.

01:30:39.074 --> 01:30:41.811
It's okay. It's over.

01:30:44.445 --> 01:30:46.912
You can sleep.

01:30:46.914 --> 01:30:48.984
Mr. Fluffy looks tired.

01:30:53.454 --> 01:30:54.990
Sweet dreams.

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:55.251
<i>Kate? Kate?</i>

01:31:56.517 --> 01:31:57.886
Kate?

01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.990
You okay?

01:32:03.391 --> 01:32:05.892
Yeah. How is she?

01:32:05.894 --> 01:32:09.895
Doctor says she'll be fine.
I guess it was all in her mind.

01:32:09.897 --> 01:32:12.866
Demons only exist up here.

01:32:12.868 --> 01:32:13.867
Come on,
you've had a rough night,

01:32:13.869 --> 01:32:15.969
let me give you a ride home.

01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:17.373
Yeah, thank you.

01:32:20.208 --> 01:32:21.444
Just one second.

01:32:25.814 --> 01:32:27.279
Morning, Sophie.

01:32:27.281 --> 01:32:29.318
I hear you're feeling
much better today.

01:32:31.319 --> 01:32:33.419
And so is Mr...

01:32:33.421 --> 01:32:34.957
Huh.

01:32:36.324 --> 01:32:37.860
Where are the stitches?

01:32:47.002 --> 01:32:49.772
I forgive you,
but Mom can't.

01:32:50.806 --> 01:32:51.938
Sophie...

01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:54.506
I will never forgive you!

01:32:54.508 --> 01:32:58.377
You left me alone to die!
