I--I'm Christopher--
- Plover.

00:12.838 --> 00:14.797
- You were looking
for your book.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.756
Yours and your friends' books
are in the Revision Room.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.584
But I happen to know
where that is.

00:19.628 --> 00:22.457
- The end of Quentin's book.
He's going to die.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.372
- Isn't that how all books end?

00:24.415 --> 00:25.721
- His ends next week.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.375
- Your birthright box,

which it has been
my honor to guard,

dictated your absence
from the kingdom

00:32.641 --> 00:33.859
and your return.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.819
- We need your help, Shoshana.

00:36.862 --> 00:38.647
- I have a new deity to follow.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.257
- The Poison Room fountain

00:40.301 --> 00:42.390
has a stack of books
for a statue.

00:42.433 --> 00:43.521
- So if we find
the right fountain...

00:43.565 --> 00:44.522
- We can walk right in.

00:44.566 --> 00:45.654
- When you get back

00:45.697 --> 00:47.264

00:47.308 --> 00:50.398
could I maybe
have Eliot back?

00:50.441 --> 00:52.878
- You were friends
with Eliot.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.924
The very best of friends.

00:54.967 --> 00:58.754
You should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.670
I felt the moment
his soul died.

01:01.713 --> 01:03.454
- Or he's trapped in there.

the Monster does,

of the Physical Kids cottage

01:19.949 --> 01:20.906
must know.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.517
- Where the bathroom is.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.518
- How to make...

01:23.561 --> 01:24.867
- How to make.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.390
- Our signature cocktail.
- How to make

01:26.434 --> 01:27.435

01:51.807 --> 01:54.244
Sorry, I had to interrupt
an orgy upstairs.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.854
- You broke up the orgy?

01:55.898 --> 01:58.205
- No, I told them
there was a bigger room

01:58.248 --> 01:59.249

01:59.293 --> 02:01.295

Now...

02:02.948 --> 02:04.602
I don't say this lightly,

02:04.646 --> 02:07.388
but I think this might be
our best party yet.

02:07.431 --> 02:10.956

the weight of my whole heart.

Whoever is that desperate
to come in can't be fun.

about summer?

Nothing.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.506

to find my friends
and tell them I'm alive.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.964
Help me.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.966
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.141
I can do that.

09:37.185 --> 09:39.622
Right?
- Yeah.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.235
There's a door somewhere.

09:44.279 --> 09:47.151
Hidden deep
in a forgotten remembrance.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.762
- Forgotten remembrance?

09:48.805 --> 09:50.764
- For me it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

09:50.807 --> 09:53.244
But not...part of the memory.

09:53.288 --> 09:54.898
Just...

09:54.942 --> 09:56.465
just there.
- What memory?

09:56.508 --> 09:59.207
Where--how did
you get there, Charlton?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.731
- You can get to any memory.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.081
You just think on it
and walk outside.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.170
The one you seek, though,
is difficult to find.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.781
It's hidden well.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.783
Even from you.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.785
It hides in the place
you think of least

10:11.828 --> 10:14.657
because you don't wish to.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.745
Why?

10:15.789 --> 10:18.052
Because it's so terrible.

10:18.095 --> 10:19.967
- Huh.
So just my most

10:20.010 --> 10:22.317
repressed and traumatic memory.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.407
This'll be fun.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.931
Come on, Charlton.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.411
Time to take a walk
down memory lane.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.326
- Wait, wait, wait.

10:31.369 --> 10:33.110
Why do I have to come?
- You're coming.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.157
- Are you sure this is
the right one?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.767
- What, you don't
trust the book?

10:37.811 --> 10:39.160
- Well, no, it's just I--

10:39.203 --> 10:40.944
well, I've never seen one
locked before.

10:40.988 --> 10:43.381
- Here.

10:49.387 --> 10:52.390
[stones clicking]

10:56.394 --> 10:57.700
[grunts]

11:10.234 --> 11:12.236
I'll throw this down for you
in case you change your mind

11:12.280 --> 11:13.498
and you wanna climb back up.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.327
- Oh, very good.

11:19.548 --> 11:23.117
Right.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.468
Well, Alice, I suppose
this is good-bye.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.427
I do hope wherever you go is...

11:29.471 --> 11:31.560
is where you're supposed to be.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.257
- Same to you.

11:33.301 --> 11:37.000
- Right.
Well, here goes...

11:38.915 --> 11:41.744
[water splashes]

11:59.936 --> 12:03.766
- Hey, 23.
Can I get a ride?

12:03.810 --> 12:06.377
- I ain't your personal Uber.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.553
I'm back to Earth
after finishing the eggs,

12:08.597 --> 12:09.946
which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

12:09.990 --> 12:11.513
- It'll be real quick.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.428
I just need to get
my birthright box.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.777
And I'd love to do that

12:14.821 --> 12:15.865
before having to break
the Eliot news

12:15.909 --> 12:17.519
to the whole castle.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.521
Because that's not gonna be
a short convo.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.784
- Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.568
- You're seriously
blowing me off

12:23.612 --> 12:25.570
to score points
with your crush?

12:25.614 --> 12:27.442
- I'm the only one that
can perform the ritual.

12:27.485 --> 12:30.662
You're the one that brought
your fuckboy with you.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.403
- I brought Josh

12:32.447 --> 12:34.754
'cause we needed a decent cook.

12:34.797 --> 12:35.929
And we're cool.

12:35.972 --> 12:37.757
- Just like Julia
and me are cool.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.585
Cool?
- Cool, so about that ride?

12:40.629 --> 12:43.588
- Thanks for breakfast.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.504
- High King Margo, you're back!

12:47.941 --> 12:49.943
Where's Eliot?

12:55.862 --> 12:57.951
- Hey, Julia, uh...

12:57.994 --> 12:59.996
ready to run some diagnostics?

13:00.040 --> 13:03.870
Sup, Shoshana?
- Oh, we already ran them.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.436
- Oh, uh...

13:05.480 --> 13:06.437
Okay, what did they say?

13:06.481 --> 13:07.787
- Inconclusive.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.919
Uh, we're looking for
the right ritual to try.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.008
- But, um,
I'm her follower now,

13:12.052 --> 13:15.316
so I can handle it.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.449
- Right, so I'll just--
- Oh, do you happen to know

13:18.493 --> 13:20.060
any diagnostics to run

13:20.103 --> 13:23.498
on pseudo-gods or whatever?

13:23.541 --> 13:24.673
- Can't say that I do.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.458
- Mm.
Oh, so...

13:27.502 --> 13:31.027
We're good here, then.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.463
- Right.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.335
I'm gonna bounce.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.467
Uh, text me if you, uh,

13:36.511 --> 13:38.948
need a ride, or...

13:38.992 --> 13:40.080
something.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.081
- Thanks, Penny.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.039
- [gasps] Oh, shit, I--

13:43.083 --> 13:45.041
I totally forgot to ask

13:45.085 --> 13:46.826
if you have any
magical wards or cloaks.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.131
They could be interfering.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.699
- Uh, yeah, a massive
cloaking spell.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.962
This evil bitch
Irene McAllister is after me--

13:53.006 --> 13:54.877
so, uh, you can't remove it.
I need it.

13:54.921 --> 13:57.575
- Oh, crap, I just did.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.839
Um, just, um, give me
30 seconds.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.451
I'll protect you.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.887
- Julia.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.846
Check out this bitch.

14:06.889 --> 14:07.977
- Iris.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.460
What are you doing here?

14:12.503 --> 14:13.853
- That Monster you let
out of the Castle

14:13.896 --> 14:15.942
is after me and my friends.

14:15.985 --> 14:18.074
Gods in hiding.
It's so gauche.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.554
But you're gonna
help us trap him.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.425
- I'll help you.

14:21.469 --> 14:22.905
If you tell me what I am.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.689
I'm not a human.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.126
Not a god.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.997
- You're the worst parts
of both.

14:28.041 --> 14:31.522
Helpless as a human,
immortal as a god,

14:31.566 --> 14:33.437
so everyone you ever love
will die

14:33.481 --> 14:35.962
and you're just stuck here
on this stupid rock,

14:36.005 --> 14:37.789
alone, forever.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.008
Because no one can kill you

14:39.052 --> 14:40.880
except for, oh, hey,

14:40.923 --> 14:42.794
someone exactly like me.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.013
So listen.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.972
This is a living stone.

14:46.015 --> 14:48.104
Its blood keeps the Monster
from traveling.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.540
Blackspire's made of
thousands of these.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.977
That's why
it's the perfect prison.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.805
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.678
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

14:56.721 --> 14:59.420
So bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him.

14:59.463 --> 15:00.900
I'll take him to the Castle.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.858
- You really need me, or...

15:02.902 --> 15:04.599
did you just come here
to talk shit?

15:04.642 --> 15:05.905
- Mm.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.907
Gods can't touch the blood.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.169
It fritzes our powers,

15:09.212 --> 15:11.432
not that that's a problem
for you.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.824
I'll be watching.

15:12.868 --> 15:15.218
Once you dump the blood,
I'll do the rest.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.655
And please, don't do
your usual thing

15:17.699 --> 15:19.919
and screw it up.

15:24.053 --> 15:28.536
- Okay.
Cloak's back on.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.929
What?

15:32.975 --> 15:34.629
Do I have a booger?

15:39.199 --> 15:41.157
- Well.
[sniffles]

15:41.201 --> 15:43.812
That wasn't as bad
as I expected,

15:43.855 --> 15:47.642
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

15:47.685 --> 15:52.081
- Yeah.
Just two short hours.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.649
- How long did you cry?

15:54.692 --> 15:57.043
When you found out
that Eliot's...

15:57.086 --> 15:58.087
that he...

15:58.131 --> 16:00.829
- I've been a little busy.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.962
And it seems like
you're good now.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.050
So I'm gonna go.

16:04.093 --> 16:06.008
- Wait, wait, Margo.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.227
Margo.

16:07.270 --> 16:10.230
Margo.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.840
- High King Margo.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.277
You're returned.
- And just leaving.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.236
- Before you do,

16:16.279 --> 16:19.804
could you say hello
to Her Slowness, Abigail?

16:19.848 --> 16:21.241
She's not herself.

16:21.284 --> 16:23.199
Seeing you might lift
her spirits.

16:23.243 --> 16:25.288
- What's wrong with her?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.595
- She's not speaking.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.858
She hasn't said a word
to me all day.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.816
- Rafe.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.081
Come here.

16:35.124 --> 16:37.039
[both sniffling]

16:37.083 --> 16:39.650
[both crying]

16:39.694 --> 16:41.043
- So, great,
you have each other.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.089
I'm going to find
my birthright box.

16:45.874 --> 16:48.790
- Look, not to be a dick,
but, uh,

16:48.833 --> 16:51.140
drawing blood from a stone
is a saying for a reason.

16:51.184 --> 16:52.533
- Yeah, I know.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.056
She wasn't in the mood
to elaborate.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.537
- Yeah, she was too busy
making threats.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.582
- Shoshana has
her reservations,

16:58.626 --> 16:59.714
but we have no choice, so--

16:59.757 --> 17:01.281
- Wait, what reservations?

17:01.324 --> 17:03.587
- Well, Shoshana thinks that--
- Iris can't be trusted.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.241
Okay?
That bitch is all sketch.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.808
Bacchus hated her.

17:06.851 --> 17:09.071
- Why, did she, uh, give him
an intervention?

17:09.115 --> 17:10.159
- No, he wouldn't say.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.031
And he told me everything.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.641
Okay, look, the point is,

17:13.684 --> 17:15.904
Iris talked him
into doing something

17:15.947 --> 17:17.340
a long time ago, okay,

17:17.384 --> 17:19.560
and the fact that he wouldn't
say what it was?

17:19.603 --> 17:21.953
That should be enough
to scare us off.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.043
- Look, we don't have a choice.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.566
Iris made that damn clear.

17:25.609 --> 17:27.350
So if you could help us--
- I am helping.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.874
- No, Shoshana, you're
getting in the way.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.921
- No, she's right.
We have to do this.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.706
- Q, if this works,

17:35.750 --> 17:39.101
Eliot will be locked
in Castle Blackspire forever.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.582
- Eliot's dead.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.975
And the Monster's
coming back here.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.848
So let's figure this out
before he does.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.381
- Hey.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.035
- Hey.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.866
- Penny, right?

18:04.909 --> 18:06.607
- I know you?

18:17.922 --> 18:19.620
- Well, here it is, Charlton.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.709
My greatest trauma.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.102
- Someone put a sheet over you

18:23.145 --> 18:24.842
and wheeled around
your strange bed.

18:24.886 --> 18:28.150
- That's Logan Kinnear.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.718
Very deceased.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.329
That's me.

18:33.373 --> 18:36.506
The first time I ever
used magic was, um...

18:36.550 --> 18:39.814
to kill Logan
with that school bus.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.859
- That is very fuck.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.687
- That's, um, still
not quite right.

18:43.731 --> 18:47.300
It's more of an adverb.

18:47.343 --> 18:49.867
Anyway,
he was a bully.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.740
He was the single worst person
in my life.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.220
I can't tell you how many times

18:54.263 --> 18:58.572
he made me think
about killing myself.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.313
But when I did this,

19:00.356 --> 19:04.230
I became the worst person
in my life.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.883
Well, this has been...

19:05.927 --> 19:07.407
very therapeutic.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.235
Um, but I'm not seeing
any doors.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.845
- Is there something...

19:10.888 --> 19:14.805
especially painful
that you're avoiding?

19:14.849 --> 19:16.372
- Look at me.
I would say that I--

19:16.416 --> 19:19.201
I--I am suffering
some very special pain.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.769
- Well, it's not all bad.

19:21.812 --> 19:24.728
You have a friend
to comfort you.

19:26.295 --> 19:29.516
- My only childhood friend.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.779
Taylor.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.608
Everyone else would
taunt and bully me,

19:34.651 --> 19:37.567
but never Taylor.

19:37.611 --> 19:40.788
Never.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.877
Oh, shit.

19:42.920 --> 19:47.186
I think I know
where we need to go.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.797
- Bitch.
- Yeah!

19:49.840 --> 19:51.233
- You can kick him
harder than that.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.539
- What, you wanna kiss boys?

19:52.582 --> 19:53.931
- Queer.
- Kick him.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.411
- Faggot.
- Little bitch.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.413
- Let's kick him.
- Come on, kick him.

19:57.457 --> 19:58.588
- [whistle blows]

19:58.632 --> 20:00.460
All right, that's enough.

20:00.503 --> 20:01.765
He gets the point.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.463
Let's go, come on.
Let's go.

20:03.506 --> 20:04.464
Out of here.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.379
Let's go.
Come on.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.730
Hey! Eliot!

20:09.773 --> 20:11.688
I said that's enough.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.474
- Oh, my.

20:14.517 --> 20:17.868
- Come on, Taylor.
Let's go, buddy.

20:17.912 --> 20:21.785
- Hating myself for who I am
is one thing, but...

20:21.829 --> 20:25.746
to hurt somebody else?

20:25.789 --> 20:27.791
[supernatural shrieking]

20:29.793 --> 20:30.968
Do you see a door?

20:31.012 --> 20:32.013
- None.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.971
- Back to the Happy Place?

20:39.629 --> 20:41.675
- Hey!

20:41.718 --> 20:44.330
Hey.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.680
You got to get a visitor's pass
from the front office.

20:46.723 --> 20:49.248
[grunting, gurgling]

20:57.734 --> 21:01.260
- [muttering spell]

21:06.352 --> 21:09.268
Oh, my God, it worked.

21:10.834 --> 21:11.792
- Fantastic news.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.446
- Ow, oh, God.

21:13.489 --> 21:14.838
- [grunts]

21:14.882 --> 21:15.883
- [grunts]

21:15.926 --> 21:18.799
- What are you doing?

21:18.842 --> 21:20.670
- Um, reading.

21:24.413 --> 21:29.592
- You are so boring sometimes.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.985
Look what I found.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.338
- How did you do that?

21:36.382 --> 21:39.036
- I went to Mesopotamia
like you told me to.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.560
- I never said--

21:40.603 --> 21:42.344
- It's really quite different
than I remember,

21:42.388 --> 21:43.911
and I couldn't find
anything useful.

21:43.954 --> 21:46.740
I got so frustrated
I almost broke it.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.350
But when I pick it up

21:48.394 --> 21:50.483
and focus my power into it,

21:50.526 --> 21:52.746
this happens.

21:52.789 --> 21:53.921
What does it say?

21:53.964 --> 21:55.444
- We could look those up.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.316
The symbols.
- Really? How?

21:57.359 --> 21:58.360
- Books.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.709
- Books.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.929
- There's a library here.
- Mm, library.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.671
- Or we can take a field trip.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.760
- Field trip...
- To...

22:06.803 --> 22:08.370
Brakebills.

22:08.414 --> 22:09.719
We could take a field trip
to Brakebills.

22:09.763 --> 22:11.982
They have--they have
a huge library.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.680
- Field trip to...

22:13.723 --> 22:16.813
- Tons of books.
- To Brakebills.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.516
- Holy dick shit!

22:23.559 --> 22:24.604
What are you doing?

22:24.647 --> 22:25.909
- The Last Lay.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.998
The widow lays
in her marital bed

22:28.042 --> 22:30.871
buried in the garments
of her deceased love.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.613
I was worried; you weren't
at the bare-breasted laments.

22:33.656 --> 22:37.399
- Yeah? My boobs can lament
just fine covered, thanks.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.009
Can we get the locksmith
up here?

22:39.053 --> 22:40.489
- Everyone's gone for the day.

22:40.533 --> 22:41.882
- The whole staff is gone?

22:41.925 --> 22:43.405
- Except for the carpenters

22:43.449 --> 22:45.102
building the Altar
of Remembrance.

22:52.414 --> 22:55.374
- [muttering spell]

23:05.514 --> 23:08.125
- Hi, Quentin.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.173
- I need to tell you something.

23:12.216 --> 23:13.740
Can I come in?

23:13.783 --> 23:16.786
- Uh, no.
- Fine.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.092
I was in the Library...

23:18.135 --> 23:19.310
- Of course you were.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.051
- Don't be a shit.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.357
They locked me up, okay?

23:22.401 --> 23:24.011
And...but I escaped,

23:24.054 --> 23:27.275
and I changed our books
so that they can't track us.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.930
And when I was reading
your book I read the end.

23:29.973 --> 23:33.107
Q, you die in two days.

23:33.150 --> 23:36.719
- Why should I believe you?

23:39.113 --> 23:41.202
- You're bleeding
a living stone, right?

23:41.245 --> 23:45.119
To kill the Monster?

23:45.162 --> 23:46.773
You spend two whole days
bleeding it

23:46.816 --> 23:49.819
and when you finally douse him
with it, he kills you.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.212
I'm not here to scare you.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.779
I'm just here to tell you

23:52.822 --> 23:54.868
to forget the plan and run now.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.217
- If we don't trap the Monster,

23:56.260 --> 23:58.480
Iris kills Julia.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.961
So thank you
for the information,

24:01.004 --> 24:02.266
but I'm not bailing on her.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.485
- It's your life, Q.

24:03.529 --> 24:04.834
- What if I beat the book?

24:04.878 --> 24:06.183
It says it takes two days.

24:06.227 --> 24:09.491
What if I bleed it
faster than that?

24:09.535 --> 24:13.147
- Any changes to the book
can have a ripple effect.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.454
Maybe it would work.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.413
- I can't do it any faster,
so if you...

24:18.457 --> 24:21.024
care to help, um...

24:28.118 --> 24:31.426
- I...hate books.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.515
Let's go back to the apartment.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.517
- Nope, sorry.

24:35.561 --> 24:39.478
If we wanna find it,
it's gonna be here.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.567
- This is it.

24:41.610 --> 24:42.959
- You found it?

24:43.003 --> 24:44.831
- Yes. No?
- No.

24:44.874 --> 24:47.311
- Yes...?

24:49.313 --> 24:51.228
- This game is confusing.

24:51.272 --> 24:52.969
Which is it?
- Yes.

24:53.013 --> 24:54.797
We found something.

24:54.841 --> 24:57.844
It's just the, um,
the wrong thing.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.281
It's just totally wrong.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.196
- I'm sorry.

25:09.377 --> 25:13.076
- I really hate books.

25:21.432 --> 25:23.478
- [coughs]

25:23.522 --> 25:24.479
Okay.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.567
This is the inscription,

25:25.611 --> 25:26.873
but we're trying to stall him.

25:26.916 --> 25:28.309
- I thought I was helping.

25:28.352 --> 25:29.571
- I know.
Look,

25:29.615 --> 25:31.268
you should go
help Q at the apartment.

25:31.312 --> 25:32.356
- Please let me stay.

25:32.400 --> 25:33.967
I'll stall him, I'll shut up,

25:34.010 --> 25:36.143
I'll do whatever you want,
just...

25:36.186 --> 25:37.971
he already took Bacchus
from me.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.539
I couldn't stand losing
another god to him.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.888
- Okay.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.280
Just stay out
of the way, got it?

25:43.324 --> 25:45.587
- Yes, yes, my goddess.
Yes.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.328
- This is too many.

25:47.371 --> 25:49.983
- If I cut it down any more,
we're chopping bone.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.462
Any one of these
could have the door.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.116
- Or creature
waiting to kill us.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.902
It's really best
if we stay here.

25:55.945 --> 25:59.166
- No, I have to let my friends
know I'm still in here.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.342
We have to go back.

26:01.385 --> 26:05.215
- Whatever you say,
Jack Shepherd.

26:05.259 --> 26:08.262
- Was that a..."Lost"
reference?

26:08.305 --> 26:10.090
- You watched it all
one week over Christmas.

26:10.133 --> 26:11.613
I stayed in that memory
for a while.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.614
What did you think
of the finale?

26:12.658 --> 26:14.355
- Stay on task, Charlton.

26:14.398 --> 26:16.966
How do we survive visiting
all of these memories?

26:17.010 --> 26:18.359
- Oh, the large man
in the short pants

26:18.402 --> 26:19.447
was quite awful, wasn't he?

26:19.490 --> 26:20.579
- That's what we need.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.364
- More large men
in short pants?

26:23.407 --> 26:25.366
- Even better.

26:25.409 --> 26:28.195
Charlton, meet my friends.

26:28.238 --> 26:30.893
Quentin from the time
I convinced him to fight Penny.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.982
Fen, who was ready
to fight pirates

26:33.026 --> 26:34.549
at a moment's notice.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.638
And Margo the Welters captain.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.946
No force in heaven or on Earth
is more terrifying.

26:39.989 --> 26:42.165
- If you pathetic
sons of bitches

26:42.209 --> 26:45.342
aren't crying blood
by the time this is over...

26:45.386 --> 26:47.040
- Okay, okay.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.216
Save it for the creatures
that you'll be fighting

26:49.259 --> 26:51.305
while I look for a door
back to my body

26:51.348 --> 26:53.046
located in one of these.

26:53.089 --> 26:56.702
Every memory I've shoved
to a dark corner of my mind.

26:56.745 --> 27:00.009
Because being self-aware
and happy don't always mix.

27:00.053 --> 27:04.927
Let's start with
the Embarrassments Minora.

27:06.712 --> 27:10.716
The worst haircut of my life.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.980
- [screams]

27:17.287 --> 27:19.246
- I'm sorry.

27:19.289 --> 27:22.031
He's just a little shy.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.210
- Are you serious right now?

27:27.254 --> 27:29.386
- Well, it's not like
this has ever happened before.

27:29.430 --> 27:33.086
Failing that, we move on
to the darker stuff.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.609
All right, let's do this.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.959
Welcome to the Physical Kids
cottage.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.050
I sleep with people's
boyfriends.

27:58.154 --> 28:02.419
I've betrayed my friends
by accident.

28:02.463 --> 28:04.291
- Go left, go left.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.085
- And on purpose.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.481
Guards.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.222
- No, Eliot.

28:22.265 --> 28:25.312
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

28:25.355 --> 28:27.706
Eliot...

28:30.578 --> 28:32.711
- Ugh, God damn it.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.625
There's still
no fucking doors.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.410
I was feeling really good
about those.

28:36.453 --> 28:38.020
Brace yourselves, everyone.

28:38.064 --> 28:40.806
AIt's daddy issues and dicks
from here on out.

28:40.849 --> 28:42.590
[supernatural shrieking]

28:42.633 --> 28:46.463
- They're here.

28:46.507 --> 28:51.642
- Run. Run.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.470
- You even tango with
a knife maker's daughter?

28:53.514 --> 28:54.776
Come at me!

28:54.820 --> 28:55.777
[shrieks]

28:55.821 --> 28:57.083
- I got this!

28:57.126 --> 28:59.476
[grunting]
- [growling

28:59.520 --> 29:00.608
- [grunting]

29:00.651 --> 29:03.829
Your face looks like a scrotum!

29:03.872 --> 29:06.483
Agh! Go!

29:06.527 --> 29:07.833
- [screams]

29:07.876 --> 29:10.792
You bargain basement creature!

29:20.323 --> 29:21.368
- Oh...

29:21.411 --> 29:22.543
- Get some towels.

29:22.586 --> 29:26.503
- Is it bad?
- Don't look.

29:26.547 --> 29:27.809
- [sighs]

29:27.853 --> 29:29.506
Fuck.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.726
- You got it right.

29:31.770 --> 29:32.814
Yeah.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.958
- That should do it.

29:46.001 --> 29:49.222
It just needs to drain and...

29:49.265 --> 29:51.528
for a minute or two.

29:51.572 --> 29:54.923
- You can, uh, leave now.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.144
Uh, when Julia gets out
of the Brakebills ward,

29:58.187 --> 30:01.060
she'll text me
and I'll meet her in the park.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.192
Then we trap the Monster today,
not in two days.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.672
So we're good.

30:04.715 --> 30:06.195
Deathly fate averted.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.762
- I should--I should
be there with you

30:07.806 --> 30:09.720
just in case what happens
in the book starts happening.

30:09.764 --> 30:10.721
- I'm about to kill my friend.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.288
It's a monster, I know,

30:12.332 --> 30:14.160
but it's a monster
with his face and eyes

30:14.203 --> 30:16.292
and I'm just--I don't

30:16.336 --> 30:18.512
have space for us right now.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.253
- I'm not asking you to!

30:24.474 --> 30:28.522
"A dog approached,
wanting to play.

30:28.565 --> 30:32.091
"The owner followed to talk
to Quentin, distracting him.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.440
"And in that moment,

30:33.483 --> 30:36.269
"The Monster saw
the stone's blood and Quentin,

30:36.312 --> 30:40.664
"and, with a mere thought,
sliced him apart,

30:40.708 --> 30:45.147
so ending the story
of Quentin Coldwater."

30:45.191 --> 30:46.975
I didn't come here
to make up with you.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.672
I came here to save your life.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.500
I'm just trying to figure out
how to fix

30:50.544 --> 30:53.416
this mountain of shit
that I've created.

30:53.460 --> 30:57.681
- Well, it's gonna take
a lot more than just my life.

31:02.512 --> 31:06.081
- I sent Christopher Plover
to the Poison World.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.257
I figure that should give me
some points in my favor.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.085
- You what?

31:10.129 --> 31:12.305
- Well, I was supposed to
send him to a peaceful world,

31:12.348 --> 31:13.306
but I thought that maybe
he would do something

31:13.349 --> 31:14.655
to a little kid and--

31:14.698 --> 31:16.396
and you know what,
he doesn't deserve peace.

31:16.439 --> 31:19.399
- Oh, my God. Oh.
[groans]

31:19.442 --> 31:21.836
Sorry, I'm back
where you were confessing

31:21.880 --> 31:23.794
to murdering my favorite

31:23.838 --> 31:25.579
and yeah, I know, he's evil,

31:25.622 --> 31:28.190
but it's--
- But does that make me good?

31:28.234 --> 31:32.803
Does killing him make me
better or worse?

31:32.847 --> 31:34.805
- I don't know.

31:37.591 --> 31:39.723
- I am trying.

31:39.767 --> 31:44.163
Okay, Quentin?
I am always trying.

31:44.206 --> 31:47.731
So if you have some recipe
for perfect redemption,

31:47.775 --> 31:49.342
just tell me.

31:49.385 --> 31:51.126
Because I can't change
the way that you feel,

31:51.170 --> 31:53.041
so just...

31:58.133 --> 32:01.049
There's a spell...

32:01.093 --> 32:02.703
Okay, there's a spell in here

32:02.746 --> 32:04.531
that...

32:04.574 --> 32:07.055
that will tell me
where I'm supposed to go.

32:07.099 --> 32:08.230
So just let me come with you

32:08.274 --> 32:09.710
and then do this spell with me.

32:09.753 --> 32:11.886
And then wherever
it says to go, I'll go,

32:11.930 --> 32:13.322
and I will stay there
for good, okay?

32:13.366 --> 32:14.671
Just let me help you.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.807
- Wherever it says?

32:24.246 --> 32:27.728
Do you promise?

32:27.771 --> 32:30.774
- Promise.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.126
- Do whatever you gotta do.

32:34.169 --> 32:35.823
Just get it open.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.654
- This seems rash,
even for you.

32:40.697 --> 32:43.222
- Well, like my ex always said,

32:43.265 --> 32:45.267
I'll be happy once that box
is open.

32:45.311 --> 32:46.790
- Margo, have you cried yet?

32:46.834 --> 32:48.836
For Eliot?

32:48.879 --> 32:50.751
- Fen, I'm only gonna
say this once.

32:50.794 --> 32:55.582
Me joining your sad-face
therapy party is dumb.

32:55.625 --> 33:01.283
Because I can't cry out
all the sadness ever.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.459
Because if I start,

33:03.503 --> 33:07.724
I'll never stop, understand?

33:07.768 --> 33:11.598
I'll be useless forever.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.513
And somebody has to rule
this kingdom,

33:13.556 --> 33:15.167
and I will be God-damned

33:15.210 --> 33:16.603
if I drop the ball

33:16.646 --> 33:18.648
'cause I was too busy
lamenting with my tits out,

33:18.692 --> 33:21.608
all right?

33:21.651 --> 33:23.436
- Your Majesty.

33:23.479 --> 33:26.134
With deep regret
I must inform you,

33:26.178 --> 33:29.181
the royal sheep choir?
They've gone silent too.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.617
- But we need them
for the memorial.

33:30.660 --> 33:33.620
Who else will sing
the Bleats of Despair?

33:33.663 --> 33:36.144
- High King Margo.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.460
- A talking lizard
of the Dunes.

33:47.503 --> 33:49.462
I've only ever read
about these.

33:49.505 --> 33:54.162
- Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

33:58.775 --> 34:00.951
- It's the talking animals.

34:00.995 --> 34:03.476
They've all been struck dumb.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.174
- Well, shit.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.654
All right, Fen.

34:07.697 --> 34:09.699
I think I will do a ritual.
Earth specialty.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.440

34:11.484 --> 34:13.703
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

34:13.747 --> 34:16.228
That'll be perfect.

34:19.883 --> 34:22.799
- Mm, I never asked.

34:22.843 --> 34:25.585
When you found your door, um...

34:25.628 --> 34:29.197
what memory was it?

34:32.374 --> 34:34.246
- The day that I left home.

34:34.289 --> 34:35.899
- That's it?

34:35.943 --> 34:38.337
That's your most
traumatic memory?

34:38.380 --> 34:39.512
- Yes.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.731
Because I left...

34:41.775 --> 34:43.472
Home.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.213
- But it was
when you were confronted

34:45.257 --> 34:47.955
with what you fear most.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.826
- Great.

34:49.870 --> 34:53.221
So just figure out what that is

34:53.265 --> 34:55.441
and I'll make a distraction,

34:55.484 --> 34:57.791
and then--and then you can
go there.

34:57.834 --> 35:00.924
- I know you're
just a memory, but...

35:00.968 --> 35:04.363
you're a very generous one.

35:04.406 --> 35:08.802
- Well, you sacrifice
for people you love.

35:08.845 --> 35:11.718
- Oh, shit.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.460
I get it.

35:14.503 --> 35:19.943
Q, I'm gonna take you
up on that.

Go bravely.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.475
- Okay.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.612
- I know where I need to go.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.313
- Did it happen?

35:41.356 --> 35:45.839
- Fifty years.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.754
- It happened.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.760
- Okay, so they should
be coming from there.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.283
I'll stand here.
He'll come to me.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.199
And then you drench him.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.856
- It was sort of beautiful.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.945
- It really was.

36:04.988 --> 36:07.861
- I know this sounds dumb...

We--

36:10.255 --> 36:11.212
You know, think about it.

36:11.256 --> 36:15.173
Like, we--we work.

36:15.216 --> 36:17.218
And we know it 'cause
we've lived it.

36:17.262 --> 36:20.265
Who gets that kind
of proof of concept?

36:24.834 --> 36:26.401
- We were just injected with

36:26.445 --> 36:28.229
a half-century of emotion,

36:28.273 --> 36:31.928
so I get that maybe
you're not thinking clearly.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.887
- No, I'm just saying,
what if we...

36:33.930 --> 36:35.802
gave it a shot?

36:38.021 --> 36:40.807
I mean, would that
be that crazy?

36:43.288 --> 36:47.422
Why the fuck not?

Q, come on.

36:57.476 --> 37:00.522
I love you, but...

you have to know
that that's not me

37:02.611 --> 37:04.265

not when we have a choice.

Okay.

is wrong with you?

37:23.545 --> 37:27.549
And what the hell
are you doing?

37:30.160 --> 37:33.381

- Q, she's the distraction.
- Hmm? No, I...
