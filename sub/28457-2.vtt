00:01.690 --> 00:04.070
Gypsy, Dee Dee,
you guys okay?

00:04.070 --> 00:05.650
Gypsy's different.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.360
She's got the epilepsy,

00:07.360 --> 00:09.700
paraplegia, a heart murmur.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.670
She can barely
take anything by mouth.

00:12.670 --> 00:16.379
- I was just wondering
if Gypsy wants a makeover.

00:16.379 --> 00:19.050
Here, wash all that
stuff off of your face.

00:19.050 --> 00:21.140
- Girls wear makeup, Mom.

00:21.140 --> 00:24.060
- You're not like other girls.

00:24.060 --> 00:25.480
Gypsy!
No!

00:25.480 --> 00:27.910
- Dee Dee, what's wrong?
- She's allergic.

00:27.910 --> 00:30.660
I gotta get her
to the emergency room.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.000
- Your daughter does
not have a sugar allergy.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.340
Well,
something's wrong with her.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.890
- Get in bed.

00:42.890 --> 00:44.810
- Ugh.
We found
Mrs. Blanchard.

00:44.810 --> 00:47.820
- What about Gypsy?
Where is Gypsy?

01:06.150 --> 01:07.570
So what are you
gonna do now?

01:07.570 --> 01:10.030
Put out an AMBER alert
on Gypsy?

01:10.030 --> 01:12.330
It's not like she could
have just ran off.

01:12.330 --> 01:15.250
- She's really sick, I mean--
I mean, she needs her meds.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.130
- "Sick" how?
- Epilepsy.

01:18.130 --> 01:19.970
Stomach tube--
- Muscular dystrophy.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.600
- Wait, I thought
it was cerebral palsy?

01:21.600 --> 01:23.270
- No, no, she has,
like, a spinal injury.

01:23.270 --> 01:25.100
No, it was chromosomal.
She was born with it.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.730
- Okay, guys,
if we could go one at a time,

01:26.730 --> 01:28.900
that'd be helpful.

01:28.900 --> 01:32.410
- She had too many problems.
We must have lost track.

01:34.790 --> 01:38.000
<i>All right,</i>
<i>go ahead and just let that</i>
<i>sit for a minute or two,</i>

01:38.000 --> 01:40.680
<i>just to make sure</i>
<i>that everything</i>
<i>really soaks in there,</i>

01:40.680 --> 01:43.310
<i>and your lips are nice</i>
<i>and soft and moisturized.</i>

01:43.310 --> 01:46.520
<i>All right, so the next thing</i>
<i>you're gonna wanna do</i>
<i>is use a lip pencil.</i>

01:46.520 --> 01:48.900
<i>I have a really</i>
<i>nice moisturizer.</i>
<i>It's a Softlips.</i>

01:48.900 --> 01:52.780
<i>This one I like</i>
<i>in particular because</i>
<i>it has sunscreen in it.</i>

01:52.780 --> 01:56.290
So, just go ahead and start
filling in your entire lip.

01:56.290 --> 01:58.550
<i>So, I like to start</i>
<i>from the middle...</i>

01:58.550 --> 02:00.720
<i>And I just</i>
<i>make my way up.</i>

02:00.720 --> 02:03.010
- Not so bad, just takes
a little bit of practice.

02:03.010 --> 02:05.930
But I wanted to use these
because they just look
so princess-y.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.060
- If you wanna go for,
like, the full brow,

02:08.060 --> 02:10.150
and it'll suit your face,
then go for it.

02:10.150 --> 02:14.200
Her brows are really
strong, so, you know.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.670
- You need fake eyelashes.
- Lots to love trio...

02:17.670 --> 02:19.420
- If you want to
impress your man,

02:19.420 --> 02:21.300
your crush, your boyfriend...

02:21.300 --> 02:23.720
- Very white and just
very sparkly-shimmery.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.980
<i>The light-skinned</i>
<i>girls, they usually use,</i>

02:26.980 --> 02:31.240
<i>like, a dark brown,</i>
<i>but the darker-skinned girls</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:33.320
<i>can usually use,</i>
<i>like, a black.</i>

02:33.320 --> 02:35.830
- If you're lonely and single,
just do as I say.

02:35.830 --> 02:37.920
Before you know it,
you'll have someone
paying your bills.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.590
- That looks good.
I'm excited.

02:48.850 --> 02:52.190
Ow.
Ow.

02:52.190 --> 02:54.450
<i>A nice, like, highlight.</i>

03:26.090 --> 03:28.640

03:49.770 --> 03:53.400

03:56.660 --> 04:01.000

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
What is it?

04:05.880 --> 04:07.930
"Springfield Gives"?

04:07.930 --> 04:09.350
- Oh.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.770
They help the
special kids like you.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.860
- I'm their
"Child of the Year"?

04:16.860 --> 04:20.290
- Yes!
Oh.

04:20.290 --> 04:23.420
But I'm not surprised after
that nomination I sent in.

04:23.420 --> 04:24.960
I worked so hard on it.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.970
I worked hard on it
every morning for a week

04:27.970 --> 04:30.060
so they would know
how special you are.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.890
Oh, and there's
gonna be a celebration

04:31.890 --> 04:33.310
right here in Springfield.

04:33.310 --> 04:34.730
Think of it.

04:34.730 --> 04:37.910
People coming from
all over to see us,

04:37.910 --> 04:40.120
to see you...

04:40.120 --> 04:43.000
- There are gonna be other
people my age there, right?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.710
I can dress up in my--

04:44.710 --> 04:46.710
my princess dress
and make friends.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.050
Oh...

04:48.050 --> 04:51.140
Oh, of course
there'll be all kinds of kids.

04:51.140 --> 04:53.020
You've always been my princess,

04:53.020 --> 04:56.650
but now you'll be everybody's.

04:56.650 --> 04:58.360
Are you okay, hun?

04:58.360 --> 05:00.530
- Mm-hmm, I'm fine.
I just...

05:00.530 --> 05:02.750
Oh, Gypsy Rose.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.170
Gypsy Rose, open up.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.390
Open.
Wider.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.560
Lord.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.770
Oh, how long
has it been hurting?

05:16.770 --> 05:18.190
- A little while.

05:18.190 --> 05:20.160
I just thought maybe
if I brushed harder,

05:20.160 --> 05:22.790
it would go away, or...

05:22.790 --> 05:26.130
- Well, your teeth can't be
going bad all on their own.

05:26.130 --> 05:31.010
There's gotta be some kind
of underlying... condition.

05:31.010 --> 05:34.810
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.

05:34.810 --> 05:37.230
Oh, is your throat hurting

05:37.230 --> 05:39.740
first thing in the morning?

05:39.740 --> 05:43.370
And you got a burning in
your chest and in your tummy?

05:43.370 --> 05:46.290
I know what this is.

05:49.300 --> 05:53.140
Oh...

05:55.730 --> 05:59.190
Hi, good to see you again.
- Hi.

05:59.190 --> 06:00.780
Hi, Gypsy.
How are you?

06:00.780 --> 06:02.780
- I'm good.
Thank you.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.750
- Oh, you're back.
- Oh, yeah, we're back.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.880
Uh-oh.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.140
Now, hang on just one minute.

06:15.140 --> 06:17.270
I don't know what they told you

06:17.270 --> 06:19.110
at the store, young lady,

06:19.110 --> 06:22.820
but that model is not
gonna turn into a prince

06:22.820 --> 06:25.080
no matter how many times
you kiss it.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.540
- Oh, Dr. Harley,
you're too much.

06:27.540 --> 06:31.010
Say hello...

06:31.010 --> 06:34.560
So, what are my favorite
patients doing here?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.640
- Oh, it's Gypsy.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.900
Her teeth are like
Swiss cheese.

06:38.900 --> 06:42.110
Now, here.
See?

06:42.110 --> 06:44.950
Has had reflux issues
since she was a baby.

06:44.950 --> 06:47.580
She got the feeding tube
put in in 2002.

06:47.580 --> 06:50.420
Then they prescribed
15 milliliters of Zantac,

06:50.420 --> 06:53.970
but now Gypsy's
complaining of a sore throat,

06:53.970 --> 06:55.600
and her stomach is burning,

06:55.600 --> 06:57.930
and I just know that
that acid is back

06:57.930 --> 06:59.440
and it's ruining her teeth.
- Okay, okay.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.780
Okay, I give up...

07:01.780 --> 07:04.200
How about, why don't I bring

07:04.200 --> 07:07.240
a gastroenterologist
down here, huh,

07:07.240 --> 07:08.960
for a checkup right now.

07:08.960 --> 07:11.130
- Oh, you're such a dear.
- Yeah? Save you a step?

07:11.130 --> 07:13.380
- Thank you.
- Ah, it's no trouble at all.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.890
There is a new specialist here

07:16.890 --> 07:19.390
that apparently
everyone is raving about.

07:19.390 --> 07:20.730
Ooh.

07:20.730 --> 07:22.610
So I am gonna get her
down here for you.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.030
Her name is--
oh, Dr. Chandra.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.540
DR. - So, very fancy.

07:28.540 --> 07:31.290
All right,
I'm gonna give her a call.

07:33.630 --> 07:36.050
- Gypsy, your regular dentist

07:36.050 --> 07:38.270
should have caught this
a long time ago.

07:38.270 --> 07:39.770
That's what I been saying.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.150
I been trying
to make an appointment,

07:41.150 --> 07:43.780
but you know how it is
with government health care.

07:43.780 --> 07:47.030
I swear, they'd rather you die
on the side of the road.

07:47.030 --> 07:49.450
And you're scared of dentists,
aren't you, hun?

07:49.450 --> 07:51.920
- Okay, Mom,
I would make a new appointment,

07:51.920 --> 07:53.920
and I would tell them
that it's urgent.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.550
And I would get in there
as soon as I can.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.050
- Thank you, I have,

07:58.050 --> 08:00.850
but we're really here about
her underlying condition...

08:00.850 --> 08:02.270
- Um...
- Acid reflux.

08:02.270 --> 08:04.780
- Well, I--I mean,
it could explain the decay,

08:04.780 --> 08:06.530
especially without
salivary glands,

08:06.530 --> 08:08.450
but, um...

08:08.450 --> 08:10.710
Gypsy, do you take
any food orally?

08:10.710 --> 08:13.290
- Oh, barely anything,
just enough to get a taste.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.460
- Maybe 20%?
- 20%?

08:15.460 --> 08:17.430
Well,
she can swallow,

08:17.430 --> 08:19.890
but then you pay the price

08:19.890 --> 08:22.900
with those tummy aches
and such.

08:22.900 --> 08:26.530
But she never has candy.
She's allergic to sugar.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.160
- Okay, let me
check out a few things.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.620
Do you mind if
I touch your neck?

08:32.620 --> 08:34.500
Okay.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.630
All right, just swallow.

08:36.630 --> 08:39.640
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Again.

08:44.110 --> 08:46.110
Mm-hmm, again.

08:49.580 --> 08:50.990
Okay, that's good.

08:50.990 --> 08:53.460
- I'm not a doctor, but, uh--

08:53.460 --> 08:56.340
but I think
she has a hiatal hernia--

08:56.340 --> 08:59.260
- When did you say she had
her salivary glands removed?

09:01.180 --> 09:03.520
- Well, let me check...

09:09.660 --> 09:13.080
Is he cuddly?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.080
- Just a ballpark, Mom.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.180
Is that Gypsy's
full medical records?

09:20.180 --> 09:21.600
Could I just take
a quick look at them?

09:21.600 --> 09:23.310
- I'm sorry,
the records that you want

09:23.310 --> 09:25.100
were all lost during Katrina.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.820
Ah, I see.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.870
All right, well,
the good news is that

09:30.870 --> 09:32.700
feeding tubes
don't have to be permanent.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.210
- They don't?
- Oh, enough is enough.

09:35.210 --> 09:36.840
First things first.

09:36.840 --> 09:39.510

09:57.540 --> 10:00.680

poor thing.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.970
- Wait.

10:06.020 --> 10:08.230
This might help
with the reflux.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.740
Oh, if it wasn't screwed on.

10:12.740 --> 10:15.410
I swear.

45:57.780 --> 45:59.780

46:03.910 --> 46:05.790
Oh, my goodness.

46:05.790 --> 46:07.590
Your teeth look excellent.

46:07.590 --> 46:09.550
Are you able to eat more
as a result of it?

46:09.550 --> 46:11.680
- Um, I still

46:11.680 --> 46:13.060

46:13.060 --> 46:14.810
Well, if that's what you're,

46:14.810 --> 46:16.480

the best that I can do.

46:18.780 --> 46:19.990
- Mm.

46:19.990 --> 46:22.370
- But I hope that one day

46:22.370 --> 46:24.330
I can not maybe have
to use

46:24.330 --> 46:25.920
the tube anymore,
like you said.

46:25.920 --> 46:30.050
- Gypsy, maybe that day
isn't too far away.

46:31.550 --> 46:34.680
And remind me,
what foods can you eat?

46:34.680 --> 46:36.190
- Um, only soft foods.

46:36.190 --> 46:37.900
And no sugar,
'cause I'm allergic.

46:37.900 --> 46:39.650
So if I have sugar
I could die.

46:39.650 --> 46:42.910
- Mm, okay.
And how do you know that?

46:42.910 --> 46:46.370
- W--well, my mom did
all the tests.

46:46.370 --> 46:47.580
Okay.

46:47.580 --> 46:49.500
Gypsy, I have some
really good news for you.

46:49.500 --> 46:51.590
I spoke to a doctor

46:51.590 --> 46:53.140
who had treated you
earlier this year

46:53.140 --> 46:56.560
in one of your ER visits,
and he's not too sure

46:56.560 --> 46:58.270
that you're allergic to sugar.

46:58.270 --> 47:01.570
And frankly,
I'm not too sure, either.

47:01.570 --> 47:03.620
In fact...

47:03.620 --> 47:05.540
I'll make you a bet.

47:05.540 --> 47:08.080
I will bet you...

that you're not allergic.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.180
There you go.

47:15.180 --> 47:18.150
Here.

47:18.150 --> 47:19.570
Just take a sip.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.610
And--and don't be scared,

47:21.610 --> 47:23.990
because if you drink it
and you are allergic,

47:23.990 --> 47:25.030
I'm right here.

47:25.030 --> 47:26.540

and you are not allergic,

47:29.210 --> 47:31.840

you can--you can go crazy

47:31.840 --> 47:34.970

as you want from now on.

47:34.970 --> 47:37.390
