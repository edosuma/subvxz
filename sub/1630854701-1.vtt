Another state today issued

06:13.581 --> 06:15.291
a stay-at-home order,
South Carolina.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.919
That brings the total number of
Americans under such an order,

06:17.961 --> 06:21.339
the total percentage to more
than 97% of the country.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.757
Still there are seven states

06:22.799 --> 06:24.426

Dr. Anthony Fauci

06:30.056 --> 06:31.766
said this evening
that Iowa and Nebraska

06:31.808 --> 06:35.020

Keep it on. We're about
to get in the car.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.178
I'm sorry. I didn't think
I had to wear it outside.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.306
Droplets can float eight feet
in the air. Put the mask on.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.309
Miri, I already ran through
all my symptoms.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.854
I've no cough.
I'm breathing fine. No fever.

11:27.896 --> 11:30.023
And I can still taste
that garlic

11:30.065 --> 11:32.525
from last night's linguini.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.027
This isn't a joke, Parker.

11:35.403 --> 11:38.198
Okay. Better?

11:38.239 --> 11:39.991
This isn't a vacation,
it's a quarantine.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.993
A quarantine in style.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.539
Dude, I need to know
that you're serious.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.999
I'm going home after this.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.876
My dad won't make it
if he's infected.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.462
I am. Okay?
Pinky promise.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.880
But just relax.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.425
We can still have a little bit
of fun, right?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.552
Right? [laughs]

11:59.594 --> 12:01.429

13:26.181 --> 13:29.309
This is beautiful.
It just sits empty?

13:29.351 --> 13:31.561
Well, my dad comes up here
once a year

13:31.603 --> 13:34.564
to get drunk with his
man-friends. Tsk.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.775
I told mom to rent it out,
but no go.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.950

This is incredible.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.536
Sick. Disgusting.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.330
And it's all ours.

13:50.372 --> 13:52.290
The only neighbor
is the Lyons' cabin,

13:52.332 --> 13:55.627
which is about two miles
that way around the lake.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.673
So you don't have to worry
about anyone or their droplets.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.216
[chuckles]

14:04.719 --> 14:07.013
Holy shit.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.353
Seriously, I'm speechless.

14:13.395 --> 14:15.647
I told you.
I know how to 2020.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.360
Yo, is there a Wi-Fi password?

14:20.402 --> 14:24.197
Um... Bookcase. Taped to the
router under the stereo.

14:24.239 --> 14:26.908
- Because I'm posting this shit.
- Shit.

14:28.243 --> 14:30.203
Dude...

14:30.245 --> 14:31.746
This place is awesome.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.373

Hello, it's freezing.
You said it's gonna be warm.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.949
I said there would be sun.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.452
It's April,
you can't have it all.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.622
To quarantine. Boo!

15:16.958 --> 15:20.587
Oop, everyone's conversing
about that guy in your Insta.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.422
[chuckles] Benji.

15:22.464 --> 15:25.091
I don't know,
he's actually really cute.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.594
And I would've kept him
a little while longer

15:27.635 --> 15:30.263
if he hadn't completely
ghosted me.

15:30.305 --> 15:32.849
- Is DJ mad about it?
- Who cares?

15:32.891 --> 15:34.768
Bitch, you care. You just don't
want to admit it.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.436
I don't care.

15:36.478 --> 15:39.731
And if DJ cares,
you know that's his own problem.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.151
Okay. [chuckles]

15:43.193 --> 15:44.652
[phones chimes]

15:52.994 --> 15:54.287
Miri.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.589
"Jump in. Water's fine."
What the fuck? Who is this?

16:04.631 --> 16:08.718
I don't know. I got one earlier
on today saying, "Having fun?"

16:08.760 --> 16:11.805
That's fucking creepy, Parker.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.306
Parker: Could just be DJ using

16:13.348 --> 16:15.558
one of his frat friend's phone.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.519
He's probably just trying to
fuck with us, right?

16:17.560 --> 16:19.521
Hmm, I don't know,
could be anyone.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.315
Guess we both posted we
were coming to the lake, so...

16:22.357 --> 16:27.028
Okay, blocked. Problem solved.

with the state.

17:51.112 --> 17:55.742
But we really have to make sure
we can contact trace rapidly.

17:55.784 --> 17:59.120
Obviously, you know, including
yourself and Dr. Fauci--

17:59.162 --> 18:01.581
Fauci, drink.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.124
Great.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.920
Ah!

18:06.961 --> 18:10.548
So we have, uh,
at taskforce level, we have--

18:10.590 --> 18:12.258
Deborah Birx is kind of a babe.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.594
Uh, Doctor Birx.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.763
[laughs]

18:16.805 --> 18:18.932
Okay, what sorority
would you peg her for?

18:18.973 --> 18:20.475
Uh...

18:21.309 --> 18:22.602
Gamma Phi.

18:22.644 --> 18:26.272
[chuckles] She loves
her scarves, dude.

18:26.314 --> 18:28.650
[vehicle approaching]

18:28.692 --> 18:30.235
Uh...

18:32.320 --> 18:33.863
Did you invite other people?

18:33.905 --> 18:35.490
No, I told you I wouldn't.

18:44.374 --> 18:47.919
Maybe it's like... Postmates?
With the wrong address?

18:47.961 --> 18:50.672
Not possible. We're the only
people around here.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.849
[tense music]

19:09.733 --> 19:11.192
Who is that?

19:12.402 --> 19:13.820
I don't know.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.323
Why is he just sitting there?

19:20.201 --> 19:21.494
I'll go see what's up.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.830
Oh. Do not go out there.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.457
Why, are you scared?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.335
Yes, I'm scared. It could be
Jason Vorhees out there.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.378
Impossible.
It's Saturday the 4th.

19:30.420 --> 19:31.713
[car door shuts]

19:35.342 --> 19:38.053
It's probably just one of my
Dad's friends checking on us.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.680
You know my Mom's paranoid...

19:40.722 --> 19:42.015
Wait.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.725
Parker: What?

19:47.228 --> 19:48.855
Miri's not playing.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.565

20:45.120 --> 20:46.746
Be careful.

[tense music]

20:54.879 --> 20:56.047
Parker: Hello?

21:07.308 --> 21:08.893
Hello?

21:16.818 --> 21:18.111
Where'd he go?

21:18.153 --> 21:20.447
I-- I don't like this...

21:39.049 --> 21:41.051
[screams] Oh, my God.

21:41.092 --> 21:42.427
DJ?

21:42.469 --> 21:45.138
- What the fuck, you asshole?
- Shh!

21:45.180 --> 21:46.639
Why didn't you answer us before?

21:46.681 --> 21:48.808
'Cause I'm on the phone.
On the phone.

21:48.850 --> 21:52.228
Oh. Sir, yeah, I appreciate
the opportunity.

21:52.270 --> 21:55.648
Um... if you need to see any
more illustrations or designs,

21:55.690 --> 21:57.525
I could totally...

21:59.486 --> 22:01.196
Oh...

22:01.237 --> 22:03.490
Yeah... yeah, no-- no worries.

22:03.531 --> 22:04.699
Alright, have--

22:06.201 --> 22:07.535
Hello?

22:11.331 --> 22:12.707
What are you doing?

22:14.167 --> 22:15.669
Trying to get an internship
for the fall.

22:15.710 --> 22:20.006
No, no, no...
DJ, what are you doing here?

22:20.048 --> 22:23.009
Oh! You came all this
way to see me, DJ?

22:23.051 --> 22:26.680
That is so, so sweet.
I-- i-- it's so good to--

22:26.721 --> 22:29.182
What the fuck are you
doing in my house?

22:29.224 --> 22:30.684
Okay, okay, okay.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.853
I... just, I wanted to see you.

22:33.895 --> 22:36.022
Why didn't you announce
yourself?

22:36.064 --> 22:37.816
'Cause I was on the phone,
Your Highness.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.402
[chuckles] Okay. And your mask?

22:45.073 --> 22:46.825
I...

22:46.866 --> 22:49.035
I thought you were spending
quarantine alone?

22:49.077 --> 22:52.122
- Alone with Miri, yes.
- Hi. Yep, that's me.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.207
Whose truck is that outside?

22:54.249 --> 22:55.667
I-- I borrowed Jackson's.

22:55.709 --> 22:57.377
Mine's leaking
transmission fluid.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.712
[chuckles] Okay.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.547
You know you could've
called or texted

23:00.588 --> 23:02.424
before you just showed up here.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.301
Well, you would've said no.

23:05.343 --> 23:08.221
I would've said "no"
because I wanted to be alone!

23:08.263 --> 23:09.556
With me.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.433
Look, are really going
to make me leave?

23:11.474 --> 23:13.059
After I drove all this way?

23:21.943 --> 23:23.570
[sighs]

23:23.611 --> 23:25.321
Fine! Fine!

23:25.363 --> 23:28.575
If you respect the six feet rule
and put your fucking mask on.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.425
[whirring]

23:45.467 --> 23:47.052
How'd you know I was here?

23:48.970 --> 23:50.597
Your Instagram.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.640
You're a compulsive
poster, Parker.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.642
And then, I remembered
that time we came out here,

23:54.684 --> 23:56.478
and I met
your mom and dad...

23:56.519 --> 23:58.938
I was feeling
pretty nostalgic.

23:58.980 --> 24:02.776
And... I was kinda hoping
we could talk about some...

24:02.817 --> 24:05.111
What do you wanna talk about?

24:05.153 --> 24:07.530
Oh, well, you see,
I could tell you, Miri.

24:07.572 --> 24:11.117
But you'd have to get really,
really, really close to me.

24:11.159 --> 24:12.827
Ha. Ha. Ha.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.206
What are you making?

24:16.247 --> 24:17.832
I haven't named it yet.

24:18.667 --> 24:21.294
[whirring]

24:21.336 --> 24:22.962
[lighter clicks]

24:23.004 --> 24:25.006
[bell rings]

24:34.891 --> 24:37.143
Literally how people get sick.

24:39.521 --> 24:43.483
We're too young to get sick.
You should know that, Dr. Miri.

24:43.525 --> 24:45.151
Young people are
testing positive, too.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.696
Spring break in Miami
did not turn out well.

24:49.030 --> 24:52.492
Hope I could have my own
individual joint,

24:52.534 --> 24:55.495
I might possibly partake.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.163
Oh!

24:58.081 --> 24:59.541
Okay.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.718
The basement is calling.

25:11.720 --> 25:13.555
What's in the basement?

25:15.056 --> 25:18.018
[upbeat music]

25:44.919 --> 25:48.048
[music continues]

26:08.276 --> 26:13.239
So back home, we have all of
these strawberry patches, right.

26:13.281 --> 26:16.576
So you can basically pick
your own strawberries

26:16.618 --> 26:18.078
and then pay by the basket.

26:18.119 --> 26:19.287
It's real nice.

26:19.329 --> 26:21.873
So, my Aunt Libby's
sister-in-law's cousin

26:21.915 --> 26:23.917
has a niece
who knew this lady

26:23.958 --> 26:25.585
who pulled over
to pick some strawberries,

26:25.627 --> 26:28.630
and she had her newborn baby
in her car with her, right.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.340
So she gets out of the car

26:30.382 --> 26:33.093
and she leaves the baby in the
car seat with her milk bottle

26:33.134 --> 26:34.719
and leaves the door open,
so she can hear the

26:34.761 --> 26:36.763
baby cries or anything.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.890
Well, the mom,
she's picking berries,

26:38.932 --> 26:42.936
time goes by,
and then it occurs to her

26:42.977 --> 26:45.146
that the baby
hasn't made a sound.

26:46.481 --> 26:50.318
So she goes to check and
you know what she finds?

26:52.153 --> 26:54.823
She finds a snake in
the baby's mouth.

26:54.864 --> 26:57.617
What? Oh, God.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.119
DJ: Yeah, and the mom
freaks out,

26:59.160 --> 27:01.413
and so she pulling the snake,
but she doesn't realize

27:01.454 --> 27:04.040
how far down the baby's throat
the snake has crawled.

27:04.082 --> 27:08.128
So when she pulls the snake out,
the baby's insides come with it.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.005
Baby intestines
were everywhere--

27:10.046 --> 27:12.632
Oh, my God.
That's so fucking gross!

27:12.674 --> 27:14.259
True story. Swear to God.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.012
Yeah. That's anatomically
impossible.

27:17.053 --> 27:18.722
DJ: No, 'cause, 'cause...

27:18.763 --> 27:22.225
I don't think a snake can crawl
into a baby's mouth, right?

27:22.267 --> 27:24.102
Well, hold on. No.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.353
That's not true.

27:25.395 --> 27:28.481
'Cause the-- the baby
just had milk, right?

27:28.523 --> 27:30.775
And snakes are attracted
to milk,

27:30.817 --> 27:34.029
and my Aunt Libby is a Christian
who doesn't lie.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.406
Miri: Okay, um...

27:36.448 --> 27:37.991
Hate to break it to you, but

27:38.033 --> 27:40.118
Aunt Libby's story is
an old urban legend

27:40.160 --> 27:42.871
that migrated from Europe
which derived

27:42.912 --> 27:48.335
from a folktale called
the "Bosom Serpent."

27:48.376 --> 27:50.337
DJ: Well, Miri.

27:50.378 --> 27:53.465
Once again, your brain has
ruined a perfectly good time.

27:53.506 --> 27:56.343
Miri: I'm sorry to hear that
because I had so much fun,

27:56.384 --> 27:59.554
but I'm going to bed.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.014
Goodnight, guys.

28:01.890 --> 28:04.893
Yeah, I'm dead.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.519
Hey, pancakes in the morning?

28:06.561 --> 28:09.230
Miri: Oh, my God, he thinks
he's getting breakfast...

28:14.402 --> 28:16.237
[clanking]

28:28.083 --> 28:29.376
So...

28:29.417 --> 28:30.919
Yes.

28:32.796 --> 28:35.215
Quarantine can be fun, you know?

28:35.256 --> 28:39.386
You mean, yeah, it was until
you showed up, uninvited.

28:39.427 --> 28:40.720
[chuckles]

28:40.762 --> 28:42.222
Yeah, well, you know
why I'm here.

28:42.263 --> 28:44.724
I honestly don't, so say just...

28:44.766 --> 28:48.353
you know, say what's on
your mind or I'm going to bed.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.106
Fine.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.443
Hey!

28:56.778 --> 28:58.405
Who the fuck is this clown?

29:01.533 --> 29:04.285
Oh, God. Benji.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.414
One of their roommates
I coaxed out

29:07.455 --> 29:09.791
of his room
to come to the party.

29:09.833 --> 29:13.545
So he was nice and hot.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.132
Did you two hook up?

29:20.969 --> 29:24.973
Well, okay, do you, like, care
about this Benji dude or what?

29:25.015 --> 29:27.726
It doesn't matter
if I did or didn't.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.603
We were never exclusive, DJ.
I can do what I want.

29:30.645 --> 29:33.565
And what you wanted to do was
make out with a random dude

29:33.606 --> 29:35.108
in front of three friends
of mine that are

29:35.150 --> 29:36.943
all addicted to social media.

29:36.985 --> 29:39.988
Yeah, you wanted me
to see this, Parker.

29:40.030 --> 29:42.449
I'm sorry if I did something
to offend you.

29:42.490 --> 29:45.368
DJ: You're not sorry.
You're not.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.578
You want me to be angry.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.121
And it's fucked up
that you're constantly

29:48.163 --> 29:49.789
trying to piss me off.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.916
So you haven't hooked up with
half of Pi Phi since Thursday?

29:51.958 --> 29:55.462
- No. I haven't.
- Well, you should have.

29:55.503 --> 29:57.630
That was our deal, DJ.

29:57.672 --> 30:00.425
We're not a couple, that's the
message I'm trying to convey.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.469
Yeah, but we have something
and you know it,

30:02.510 --> 30:04.304
or else you wouldn't be
trying to sabotage it.

30:05.347 --> 30:07.015
Jesus, why does
everybody trying to

30:07.057 --> 30:08.725
fucking analyze me all the time?

30:08.767 --> 30:11.144
I'm not, I'm not.
I just want you to be honest.

30:11.186 --> 30:13.480
That's all I ask, Parker.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.023
Okay.

30:16.191 --> 30:17.984
There's something between us.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.611
Yeah, and it's real.

30:23.365 --> 30:25.950
- It's late. I'm going to bed.
- Hey...

30:30.205 --> 30:32.332
Um...

30:32.374 --> 30:33.875
I'm sorry.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.379
I know you drove all this way,

30:37.420 --> 30:39.964
but you're not going to hear
what you want to hear.

30:45.553 --> 30:46.888
Okay.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.060
[pensive music]

30:53.353 --> 30:55.313
DJ: I'll leave in the morning
and...

30:57.482 --> 30:59.150
Goodnight, DJ.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.490

Damn!

32:48.051 --> 32:49.427
It's okay.

32:52.681 --> 32:54.182
How'd it go with DJ?

32:55.058 --> 32:56.309
Nah.

32:58.186 --> 33:00.105
Was he mad about the post?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.107
Oh, yeah.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.192
[chuckles] Yeah.

33:04.234 --> 33:06.611
Well, you got what you wanted.

33:14.244 --> 33:16.329
It's obvious. He loves you.

33:19.207 --> 33:21.042
You should let him.

33:23.878 --> 33:25.797
But you're not going to, huh?

33:27.632 --> 33:29.175
Probably not.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.555
[sighs]

33:37.225 --> 33:39.185
You are text book, Parker.

33:41.354 --> 33:43.189
You're shut off from anything
close to a feeling.

33:43.231 --> 33:46.359
You're emotionally
distancing.

33:46.401 --> 33:49.154
Thank you for the
bed-time psychobabble.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.489
Miri: It's fine,
you can keep deflecting.

33:51.531 --> 33:54.701
I'm gonna keep poking you
because I love you.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.871
Great.

33:57.912 --> 33:59.414

34:03.710 --> 34:06.713
I know you're just
trying to help.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.882
And it just...

34:08.923 --> 34:13.553
It doesn't seem like it,
but... I am listening.

34:17.932 --> 34:19.225

1:04:51.766 --> 1:04:56.062
#FuckedUp, #CovidOnMyFace.

1:04:56.104 --> 1:05:01.609
#2020SucksDonkeyDick.
#FuckCovid.

1:05:04.696 --> 1:05:06.573
She's not figuring it out.

1:05:09.659 --> 1:05:12.328
[tense music]

1:05:12.370 --> 1:05:14.122
[sighs]

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:20.587
Pamela: Did you enjoy
the party, Parker?

1:05:21.963 --> 1:05:24.090
Jason: Do you even remember it?

1:05:25.467 --> 1:05:29.429
Do you know the boy
you were kissing?

1:05:31.306 --> 1:05:32.724
Benji?

1:05:33.808 --> 1:05:35.393
Pamela: Just Benji?

1:05:37.771 --> 1:05:41.775
Benji is just some guy
we met at the party.

1:05:41.816 --> 1:05:45.445
Pamela: You're very intimate
with someone that you just met.

1:05:45.487 --> 1:05:47.614
Parker: So what?

1:05:47.655 --> 1:05:50.450
I made out with
some guy at the party!

1:05:52.452 --> 1:05:55.914
[sobs] I don't even know.

1:05:55.955 --> 1:05:58.416
It didn't mean anything!

1:05:59.668 --> 1:06:01.336
Maybe not to you.

1:06:02.671 --> 1:06:05.632
[gasping]

1:06:13.848 --> 1:06:17.018
[intense music]

1:06:22.023 --> 1:06:24.651
[gasping]

1:06:24.693 --> 1:06:26.027
[coughs]

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:27.654
So selfish your generation.

1:06:27.696 --> 1:06:32.367
I mean, heaven forbid you miss a
keg party or-- or spring break.

1:06:33.326 --> 1:06:35.453
Who the fuck are you people?

1:06:35.495 --> 1:06:40.000
That boy that
you were kissing, Benji,

1:06:40.041 --> 1:06:43.003
he-- he's my youngest son.

1:06:43.044 --> 1:06:47.549
He was one of the seven people
you infected at that party.

1:06:47.590 --> 1:06:50.510
- Was?
Pamela: Three days ago...

1:06:50.552 --> 1:06:55.640
Benji died alone
in a hospital bed.

1:06:59.019 --> 1:07:01.688
But, I don't...

1:07:01.730 --> 1:07:03.189
I don't have it.

1:07:03.231 --> 1:07:05.358
Jason: I told you she wouldn't
admit to anything.

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:07.527
I know, show her the test.
Show her the test

1:07:07.569 --> 1:07:09.571
Honey, it takes a few minutes.

1:07:10.572 --> 1:07:12.699
You people are fucking crazy.

1:07:12.741 --> 1:07:16.077
- And you're fucking dead!
- No!

1:07:17.037 --> 1:07:20.165
[intense music]

1:07:24.586 --> 1:07:27.088
[whimpering]

1:07:29.758 --> 1:07:31.760
[gasping]

1:07:33.261 --> 1:07:34.804
Pamela: How does it feel

1:07:34.846 --> 1:07:37.682
to not know when you're gonna
get your last breath?

1:07:37.724 --> 1:07:42.937
To feel like you're going to
die, scared and alone?

1:07:42.979 --> 1:07:45.231
How does that feel?

1:07:45.273 --> 1:07:49.194
It could've been anyone. I...

1:07:49.235 --> 1:07:50.737
I'm not sick--

1:07:50.779 --> 1:07:53.448
You infected that party!

1:07:53.490 --> 1:07:58.078
We even did the tracing and we
found the man who gave it you.

1:07:58.119 --> 1:07:59.871
Tyler Murphy.

1:08:01.623 --> 1:08:03.792
But don't worry,
we took care of him.

1:08:05.251 --> 1:08:09.464
I'm not sick!
I don't have COVID!

1:08:09.506 --> 1:08:13.301
Well, you're positive.

1:08:15.011 --> 1:08:16.763
You're asymptomatic.

1:08:18.807 --> 1:08:20.266
[sobs]

1:08:20.308 --> 1:08:22.060
Pamela: Oh, no, no, no...

1:08:22.102 --> 1:08:24.479
Don't cry.

1:08:24.521 --> 1:08:28.149
Take responsibility
for your selfishness.

1:08:29.317 --> 1:08:31.236
This didn't have to happen.

1:08:31.277 --> 1:08:33.947
I mean, where was
your fucking mask?

1:08:33.988 --> 1:08:35.782
Where was his?

1:08:38.368 --> 1:08:40.870
This is your fault!

1:08:40.912 --> 1:08:42.789
It's your fault, you hear me.

1:08:42.831 --> 1:08:44.708
You did this!

1:08:44.749 --> 1:08:46.334
Hon, your mask.

1:08:51.339 --> 1:08:53.174
What about DJ?

1:08:54.342 --> 1:08:57.345
And my friend Miri, huh?

1:08:58.763 --> 1:09:00.306
What did they do?

1:09:00.348 --> 1:09:03.476
Pamela:
Well, per CDC guidelines,

1:09:03.518 --> 1:09:05.895
you were meant
to quarantine alone,

1:09:05.937 --> 1:09:09.190
so that is on you.

1:09:09.232 --> 1:09:10.900
Jason: What the hell?

1:09:12.152 --> 1:09:14.446
Pamela: What? What is it?

1:09:14.487 --> 1:09:16.865
Jason:
Someone's using the Wi-Fi.

1:09:22.078 --> 1:09:24.622
[tense music]

1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:34.883
Pamela: It has to be the friend.

1:09:37.886 --> 1:09:41.389
- She's dead.
- Make sure. Make sure.

1:09:46.394 --> 1:09:48.313
Jason: Goddammit!

1:09:48.355 --> 1:09:50.482
Oh! [chuckles]

1:09:52.942 --> 1:09:55.236
Oh, my God!

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:56.863
You don't want Miri.

1:09:59.115 --> 1:10:01.201
You want me.

1:10:01.242 --> 1:10:03.370
She doesn't deserve this.
I do.

1:10:03.411 --> 1:10:06.831
Wow! Look who suddenly found
some integrity.

1:10:08.083 --> 1:10:10.669
[machine whirring]

1:10:10.710 --> 1:10:14.255
Please, you can do what
ever you want with me.

1:10:15.924 --> 1:10:17.759
Just don't hurt her.

1:10:26.935 --> 1:10:29.896
[tense music]

1:10:33.650 --> 1:10:36.736
How do you think you're going to
get away with this?

1:10:38.947 --> 1:10:40.865
The police will find you.

1:10:42.242 --> 1:10:44.911
Your fingerprints,

1:10:44.953 --> 1:10:46.871
DNA is everywhere.

1:10:46.913 --> 1:10:51.251
Pamela: Irresponsible girls
can cause irresponsible

1:10:51.292 --> 1:10:55.797
fires that burn down
the house.

1:10:55.839 --> 1:10:56.631
[machine whirring]

1:10:56.673 --> 1:10:58.425
Fires happen all the time.

1:10:58.466 --> 1:11:01.594
[machine whirring]

1:11:03.138 --> 1:11:05.015
It's tragic.

1:11:32.334 --> 1:11:33.585
Parker: Shit!

1:11:33.626 --> 1:11:36.046
Come on. Okay, this way.

1:11:38.256 --> 1:11:39.257
[door slams]

1:11:39.299 --> 1:11:40.925
Where the fuck are you?

1:11:44.304 --> 1:11:45.638
Pam!

1:11:47.390 --> 1:11:49.100

1:13:44.966 --> 1:13:46.176

1:13:46.217 --> 1:13:48.261
- They destroyed the cars.
- Doesn't matter.

1:13:48.303 --> 1:13:50.930
Come on!

1:13:50.972 --> 1:13:54.309
Be calm, it's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

1:14:38.103 --> 1:14:39.479
Keys are in it.

1:14:39.521 --> 1:14:40.689
Hit the door.

1:14:40.730 --> 1:14:42.816
- Careful.
- Okay.

1:14:44.401 --> 1:14:45.944
Parker: Try and start it.

1:14:48.363 --> 1:14:50.198
Alright. Battery's good.
