00:33.233 --> 00:35.000
WELCOME TO LAST WEEK TONIGHT.

00:35.000 --> 00:35.700
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.633
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:36.633 --> 00:38.233
US.

00:38.233 --> 00:40.333
AND SADLY, WE MUST BEGIN WITH

00:40.333 --> 00:41.467
THE EVENTS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE,

00:41.467 --> 00:42.633
VIRGINIA, WHERE ONE PERSON WAS

00:42.633 --> 00:44.300
KILLED AND 19 INJURED AFTER A

00:44.300 --> 00:47.033
CAR PLOWED INTO PROTESTERS

00:47.033 --> 00:47.767
FOLLOWING A RALLY OF WHITE

00:47.767 --> 00:49.100
NATIONALISTS.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.734
IT WAS TRULY A WEEKEND OF

00:50.734 --> 00:52.367
HORRIFYING IMAGES.

00:52.367 --> 00:55.166
WE SAW NAZI FLAGS AND MARCHERS

00:55.166 --> 00:56.667
CARRYING TORCHES -- TIKI

00:56.667 --> 00:59.467
TORCHES, BY THE WAY.

00:59.467 --> 01:00.767
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING SAYS "WHITE

01:00.767 --> 01:01.934
NATIONALIST," IT'S

01:01.934 --> 01:06.033
FAUX-POLYNESIAN KITSCH AND A

01:06.033 --> 01:08.033
PROTESTER BEING KILLED IN THE

01:08.033 --> 01:09.667
WAKE OF NEO-NAZIS MARCHING IN

01:09.667 --> 01:11.533
THE STREETS OF AN AMERICAN CITY

01:11.533 --> 01:12.700
IS THE KIND OF TRAGEDY THAT

01:12.700 --> 01:14.233
CALLS FOR TRUE LEADERSHIP FROM

01:14.233 --> 01:16.400
WHOEVER IS IN THE OVAL OFFICE.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.333
UNFORTUNATELY, THE CURRENT

01:18.333 --> 01:20.767
OCCUPANT IS THIS GUY, AND EVEN

01:20.767 --> 01:22.567
AFTER A FEW HOURS TO THINK ABOUT

01:22.567 --> 01:24.467
IT, THE BEST HE COULD DO WAS

01:24.467 --> 01:26.400
SQUEEZE IN THIS RESPONSE BEFORE

01:26.400 --> 01:27.633
A BILL SIGNING:

01:27.633 --> 01:28.700
>> Trump: WE CONDEMN IN THE

01:28.700 --> 01:32.066
STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS THIS

01:32.066 --> 01:34.033
EGREGIOUS DISPLAY OF HATRED,

01:34.033 --> 01:36.133
BIGOTRY AND VIOLENCE ON MANY

01:36.133 --> 01:40.533
SIDES -- ON MANY SIDES.

01:40.533 --> 01:43.100
>> John: "ON MANY SIDES"?

01:43.100 --> 01:44.233
THIS WAS A WHITE NATIONALIST

01:44.233 --> 01:46.433
RALLY.

01:46.433 --> 01:47.233
YOU HAVE TO CALL THAT OUT BY

01:47.233 --> 01:47.767
NAME.

01:47.767 --> 01:50.000
THERE AREN'T MANY INSTANCES IN

01:50.000 --> 01:50.834
MODERN AMERICAN POLITICS WHERE

01:50.834 --> 01:53.800
YOU CAN HONESTLY THINK, "THAT

01:53.800 --> 01:54.667
GUY REALLY SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED

01:54.667 --> 01:55.934
THE NAZIS," BUT THIS IS

01:55.934 --> 01:58.066
EMPHATICALLY ONE OF THEM.

01:58.066 --> 02:00.133
IT'S LIKE A REVERSE GODWIN'S LAW

02:00.133 --> 02:01.000
-- IF YOU FAIL TO MENTION

02:01.000 --> 02:04.734
NAZISM, YOU LOSE THE ARGUMENT.

02:04.734 --> 02:06.233
AND HAVING MADE A WILD FALSE

02:06.233 --> 02:11.934
EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN "NAZIS" AND

02:11.934 --> 02:12.700
"PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE NAZIS" TRUMP

02:12.700 --> 02:13.333
MOVED ON TO HIS FAVORITE

02:13.333 --> 02:14.934
SUBJECT, HIMSELF.

02:14.934 --> 02:15.633
>> Trump: IT'S BEEN GOING ON

02:15.633 --> 02:17.400
FOR A LONG TIME IN OUR COUNTRY.

02:17.400 --> 02:18.934
NOT DONALD TRUMP, NOT BARACK

02:18.934 --> 02:21.500
OBAMA, IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A

02:21.500 --> 02:23.967
LONG, LONG TIME.

02:23.967 --> 02:25.166
>> John: IT SEEMS TRUMP'S FIRST

02:25.166 --> 02:26.333
RESPONSE TO ANYTHING BAD

02:26.333 --> 02:27.767
HAPPENING IS ALWAYS TO

02:27.767 --> 02:29.433
IMMEDIATELY ABSOLVE HIMSELF OF

02:29.433 --> 02:31.233
ANY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.367
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY WHO STARTS

02:32.367 --> 02:33.934
EULOGIES AT FUNERALS, "GREAT

02:33.934 --> 02:34.734
GUY.

02:34.734 --> 02:35.734
I DIDN'T KILL HIM, BUT HE'S A

02:35.734 --> 02:36.734
GREAT GUY AND HE'S DEAD AND I

02:36.734 --> 02:39.567
DIDN'T DO IT."

02:39.567 --> 02:40.233
AND YOU KNOW WHO MIGHT TAKE

02:40.233 --> 02:41.567
ISSUE WITH HIS STATEMENT THAT

02:41.567 --> 02:42.400
THE WHITE NATIONALISTS HAD

02:42.400 --> 02:44.500
NOTHING TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP?

02:44.500 --> 02:45.266
THE WHITE NATIONALISTS

02:45.266 --> 02:47.000
THEMSELVES.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.033
HERE'S DAVID DUKE, DURING

02:48.033 --> 02:50.033
YESTERDAY'S RALLY:

02:50.033 --> 02:50.834
>> David Duke: WE ARE

02:50.834 --> 02:51.433
DETERMINED TO TAKE OUR COUNTRY

02:51.433 --> 02:51.900
BACK.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.900
WE'RE GOING TO FULFILL THE

02:52.900 --> 02:56.000
PROMISES OF DONALD TRUMP.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.867
THAT'S WHAT WE BELIEVED IN.

02:56.867 --> 02:57.734
THAT'S WHY WE VOTED FOR DONALD

02:57.734 --> 02:59.066
TRUMP.

02:59.066 --> 03:00.333
HE SAID HE IS GOING TO TAKE OUR

03:00.333 --> 03:01.367
COUNTRY BACK, AND THAT'S WHAT WE

03:01.367 --> 03:06.000
GOTTA DO.

03:06.000 --> 03:06.734
>> John: HEY, DAVID DUKE AND THE

03:06.734 --> 03:07.400
NAZIS REALLY SEEM TO LIKE DONALD

03:07.400 --> 03:08.000
TRUMP, WHICH IS WEIRD, BECAUSE

03:08.000 --> 03:10.200
NAZIS ARE A LOT LIKE CATS:

03:10.200 --> 03:11.867
IF THEY LIKE YOU, IT'S PROBABLY

03:11.867 --> 03:14.400
BECAUSE YOU'RE FEEDING THEM.

03:14.400 --> 03:21.033
ALSO, CATS ARE LIKE NAZIS, BUT

03:21.033 --> 03:21.567
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT

03:21.567 --> 03:24.066
SUBJECT.

03:24.066 --> 03:25.567
AND THAT KIND OF CONNECTION IS

03:25.567 --> 03:26.333
SOMETHING ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT

03:26.333 --> 03:27.667
MIND WOULD WANT TO IMMEDIATELY

03:27.667 --> 03:29.400
AND REPEATEDLY DISAVOW.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.834
AND IT'S NOT LIKE TRUMP WASN'T

03:30.834 --> 03:32.000
GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY.

03:32.000 --> 03:32.867
WATCH WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END

03:32.867 --> 03:34.600
OF HIS SPEECH:

03:34.600 --> 03:36.967
>> Trump: THANK YOU.

03:36.967 --> 03:37.633
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT!

03:37.633 --> 03:39.033
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO WHITE

03:39.033 --> 03:40.834
NATIONALISTS WHO SAY THEY'RE

03:40.834 --> 03:42.567
PARTICIPATING BECAUSE THEY

03:42.567 --> 03:44.100
SUPPORT YOU?

03:44.100 --> 03:44.734
>> Trump: THEY'D LIKE ME TO SIGN

03:44.734 --> 03:49.467
THE BILL HERE, INSTEAD OF

03:49.467 --> 03:49.934
OUTSIDE.

03:49.934 --> 03:50.700
SO I THINK WE'LL DO THAT.

03:50.700 --> 03:51.467
THANK YOU.

03:51.467 --> 03:52.300
>> John: FOR A SECOND THERE, AS

03:52.300 --> 03:54.066
HE CAME BACK TO THE PODIUM, I

03:54.066 --> 03:55.100
ALMOST THOUGHT, MAYBE HE'S ABOUT

03:55.100 --> 03:58.033
TO SAY THE RIGHT THING.

03:58.033 --> 03:59.633
BUT OF COURSE NOT.

03:59.633 --> 04:00.700
HE HAD ONE LAST SHOT BEFORE THE

04:00.700 --> 04:02.500
BUZZER ON THE RACISM CLOCK HIT

04:02.500 --> 04:04.100
ZERO AND HE THREW AN AIRBALL SO

04:04.100 --> 04:06.233
FAR AWAY IT LANDED IN THE THIRD

04:06.233 --> 04:14.767
REICH.

04:14.767 --> 04:15.600
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

04:15.600 --> 04:16.633
AND FOR THE RECORD -- EVEN AFTER

04:16.633 --> 04:17.200
HE SIGNED THE BILL, HE GOT

04:17.200 --> 04:17.567
ANOTHER CHANCE:

04:17.567 --> 04:18.200
>> Reporter: MR. PRESIDENT, A

04:18.200 --> 04:18.834
NUMBER OF THE WHITE NATIONALISTS

04:18.834 --> 04:19.033
AND--

04:19.033 --> 04:19.600
>> Reporter: DO YOU WANT THE

04:19.600 --> 04:20.066
SUPPORT OF THESE WHITE

04:20.066 --> 04:23.834
NATIONALISTS WHO SAY THEY

04:23.834 --> 04:24.367
SUPPORT YOU MR. PRESIDENT?

04:24.367 --> 04:25.000
HAVE YOU DENOUNCED THEM STRONGLY

04:25.000 --> 04:27.834
ENOUGH?

04:27.834 --> 04:29.166
>> John: SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM

04:29.166 --> 04:32.767
WITH THAT: A NON-ANSWER IN A

04:32.767 --> 04:35.200
MOMENT LIKE THIS IS AN ANSWER.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.166
IF YOU ASKED ME, "HAVE YOU EVER

04:37.166 --> 04:38.867
BEEN AROUSED BY THE FAIRIES IN

04:38.867 --> 04:41.233
'ZELDA: THE OCARINA OF TIME'?",

04:41.233 --> 04:42.266
AND I RESPONDED BY SLOWLY AND

04:42.266 --> 04:45.033
SILENTLY WALKING AWAY, YOU WOULD

04:45.033 --> 04:53.633
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING.

04:53.633 --> 04:54.500
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

04:54.500 --> 04:55.100
AND DON'T TAKE THAT FROM ME --

04:55.100 --> 04:55.734
WHITE NATIONALISTS SEEMED PRETTY

04:55.734 --> 04:56.333
CLEAR ABOUT THE MESSAGE TRUMP

04:56.333 --> 04:58.300
HAD SENT THEM WITH HIS RESPONSE.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.133
>> Tapper: THIS IS FROM AN

04:59.133 --> 05:01.200
INFAMOUS NEONAZI WEBSITE.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.567
"TRUMP COMMENTS WERE GOOD.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.000
HE LOVES US ALL.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.333
ALSO REFUSED TO ANSWER A

05:05.333 --> 05:06.000
QUESTION ABOUT WHITE

05:06.000 --> 05:07.367
NATIONALISTS SUPORTING HIM.

05:07.367 --> 05:09.000
NO CONDEMNATION.

05:09.000 --> 05:09.900
WHEN ASKED TO CONDEMN HE WALKED

05:09.900 --> 05:11.433
OUT OF THE ROOM.

05:11.433 --> 05:12.767
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

05:12.767 --> 05:14.567
GOD BLESS HIM."

05:14.567 --> 05:16.433
>> John: TO WHICH GOD

05:16.433 --> 05:17.567
IMMEDIATELY RELEASED A

05:17.567 --> 05:18.367
STATEMENT:

05:18.367 --> 05:19.467
"I UNEQUIVOCALLY CONDEMN THE

05:19.467 --> 05:21.700
NAZIS WHO INVOKED MY NAME...

05:21.700 --> 05:23.033
THEIR BELIEFS AND ACTIONS IN NO

05:23.033 --> 05:24.433
WAY REFLECT THE GLORY OF MY

05:24.433 --> 05:25.800
CREATION.

05:25.800 --> 05:26.767
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF FUCKING

05:26.767 --> 05:28.333
IDIOT WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY

05:28.333 --> 05:31.433
DISTANCE HIMSELF FROM THEM?"

05:31.433 --> 05:33.100
AND LOOK: MAYBE TRUMP WILL,

05:33.100 --> 05:34.433
EVENTUALLY, TAKE A SECOND SWING

05:34.433 --> 05:36.500
AT PERSONALLY CONDEMNING THE

05:36.500 --> 05:37.033
WHITE NATIONALISTS.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.433
MAYBE HE HAS SINCE WE TAPED THIS

05:38.433 --> 05:40.767
SHOW.

05:40.767 --> 05:41.567
BUT EVEN IF HE DOES, IT'LL BE

05:41.567 --> 05:42.633
TOO LATE.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.066
BECAUSE HIS FIRST RESPONSE IS

05:44.066 --> 05:45.533
WHO HE IS.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.266
AND THE TRULY INFURIATING THING

05:47.266 --> 05:48.700
IS HOW COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE

05:48.700 --> 05:49.934
THIS WAS.

05:49.934 --> 05:52.333
NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND,

05:52.333 --> 05:54.033
AHEAD OF TRUMP'S RESPONSE

05:54.033 --> 05:55.033
YESTERDAY, THOUGHT, "WELL, THIS

05:55.033 --> 05:58.367
IS GOING TO GO WELL."

05:58.367 --> 06:00.834
THAT STILL DIDN'T SOMEHOW NEGATE

06:00.834 --> 06:01.867
JUST HOW PAINFUL IT WAS TO

06:01.867 --> 06:02.934
WATCH.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.367
BECAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T GET

06:04.367 --> 06:06.934
EASIER THAN DISAVOWING NAZIS.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.367
IT'S AS MUCH OF A PRESIDENTIAL

06:08.367 --> 06:09.667
GIMME AS PARDONING A FUCKING

06:09.667 --> 06:11.800
TURKEY.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.233
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SCREW

06:13.233 --> 06:14.533
IT UP.

06:14.533 --> 06:18.133
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

06:18.133 --> 06:18.800
SO THERE'S CLEARLY NO POINT

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
WAITING FOR LEADERSHIP FROM OUR

06:19.800 --> 06:21.200
PRESIDENT AT MOMENTS LIKE THIS,

06:21.200 --> 06:23.700
BECAUSE IT'S JUST NOT COMING.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.567
SO WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK TO ONE

06:24.567 --> 06:25.533
ANOTHER.

06:25.533 --> 06:26.700
BECAUSE INCREDIBLY, IN A COUNTRY

06:26.700 --> 06:28.400
WHERE PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAVE

06:28.400 --> 06:30.934
ACTUALLY HAD TO DEFEAT NAZIS, WE

06:30.934 --> 06:32.834
NOW HAVE ONE WHO CAN'T EVEN BE

06:32.834 --> 06:37.633
BOTHERED TO CONDEMN THEM.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.934
AND NOW, THIS:

06:40.934 --> 06:43.967
>> Announcer: NOW, HIGHLIGHTS

06:43.967 --> 06:52.000
FROM ROBOCOP 2017.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.633
AND NOW, HIGHLIGHTS VASTLY

06:57.633 --> 07:00.133
IMPROVED BY UNIVISION

07:00.133 --> 07:03.100
COMMENTATOR.

07:29.967 --> 07:30.500
>> John: MOVING ON.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.133
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

07:31.133 --> 07:32.000
NORTH KOREA, AMERICA'S NUMBER

07:32.000 --> 07:33.066
ONE EXCUSE FOR PUTTING OFF

07:33.066 --> 07:39.166
CHORES THIS WEEK.

07:39.166 --> 07:39.967
"I COULD DO LAUNDRY, BUT IF THE

07:39.967 --> 07:40.533
WORLD'S ABOUT TO ERUPT INTO

07:40.533 --> 07:41.600
NUCLEAR WAR, WHAT'S THE POINT?"

07:41.600 --> 07:42.834
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN ON

07:42.834 --> 07:43.967
EVERYONE'S MINDS THIS WEEK, AND

07:43.967 --> 07:45.500
I THINK YOU KNOW WHY:

07:45.500 --> 07:46.166
>> Boldoun: "PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

07:46.166 --> 07:47.567
NORTH KOREA ESCALATE THE WAR OF

07:47.567 --> 07:51.800
WORDS, LOBBING NEW THREATS AND

07:51.800 --> 07:52.533
SENDING NEW TWEETS.

07:52.533 --> 07:53.100
NORTH KOREA NOW ACCUSING THE

07:53.100 --> 07:54.767
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

07:54.767 --> 07:56.333
PUSHING THE WORLD TO, QUOTE, THE

07:56.333 --> 07:59.567
BRINK OF NUCLEAR WAR.

07:59.567 --> 08:00.734
>> John: WOW.

08:00.734 --> 08:02.633
WHEN TWITTER WAS INVENTED, I'LL

08:02.633 --> 08:04.033
BET EVEN THEY DIDN'T IMAGINE IT

08:04.033 --> 08:06.033
WOULD LEAD US TO THE BRINK OF

08:06.033 --> 08:08.300
NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.133
IT'S LIKE IF THE INVENTION OF

08:09.133 --> 08:10.300
THE FURBY HAD LED TO THE

08:10.300 --> 08:12.100
SUDANESE CIVIL WAR.

08:12.100 --> 08:12.934
WHO KNEW THAT'S WHERE IT WAS

08:12.934 --> 08:15.767
HEADED?

08:15.767 --> 08:16.633
TENSIONS HAVE SHARPLY ESCALATED

08:16.633 --> 08:17.900
THIS WEEK, WHICH IS A LITTLE

08:17.900 --> 08:19.200
SURPRISING, GIVEN THAT THE WORLD

08:19.200 --> 08:20.400
HAS BEEN DEALING WITH NORTH

08:20.400 --> 08:21.433
KOREA'S PROVOCATIVE MISSILE

08:21.433 --> 08:23.266
TESTS FOR YEARS NOW.

08:23.266 --> 08:24.467
JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, THEY WERE

08:24.467 --> 08:25.600
DOING THIS:

08:25.600 --> 08:26.300
>> Anchor: NORTH KOREA FIRES

08:26.300 --> 08:27.600
YET ANOTHER MISSILE, BUT

08:27.600 --> 08:29.333
PYONGYANG CLAIMS THIS ONE WILL

08:29.333 --> 08:31.066
BE ABLE TO HIT THE U.S.

08:31.066 --> 08:31.900
MAINLAND, STRIKING CITIES LIKE

08:31.900 --> 08:34.500
LOS ANGELES, DENVER, CHICAGO,

08:34.500 --> 08:35.567
AND POSSIBLY EVEN NEW YORK AND

08:35.567 --> 08:37.934
BOSTON.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.800
>> John: NEW YORK?

08:39.800 --> 08:41.066
BUT I LIVE IN NEW YORK!

08:41.066 --> 08:41.767
THEREFORE, THIS SHIT JUST GOT

08:41.767 --> 08:43.867
REAL!

08:43.867 --> 08:46.066
IF EVERYONE'S HONEST, YOUR LEVEL

08:46.066 --> 08:48.000
OF FEAR OVER THE NORTH KOREA

08:48.000 --> 08:49.200
SITUATION IS IN DIRECT

08:49.200 --> 08:50.533
PROPORTION TO WHETHER OR NOT

08:50.533 --> 08:51.667
THEY CAN HIT THE EXACT PLACE

08:51.667 --> 08:53.166
WHERE YOU LIVE.

08:53.166 --> 08:54.567
WE FILM THIS SHOW ON 57TH

08:54.567 --> 08:55.767
STREET.

08:55.767 --> 08:57.100
IF YOU TOLD ME THE BLAST RADIUS

08:57.100 --> 08:59.400
STOPS AT 56TH STREET, I'D THINK

08:59.400 --> 09:00.900
"WELL, I HOPE NOTHING HAPPENS,

09:00.900 --> 09:02.300
BUT WE'VE STILL GOT SOME TIME

09:02.300 --> 09:04.867
BEFORE THINGS GET SERIOUS."

09:04.867 --> 09:08.066
NOW, IT IS WORTH PROPERLY

09:08.066 --> 09:09.934
UNDERSTANDING WHAT NORTH KOREA'S

09:09.934 --> 09:11.100
CURRENTLY CAPABLE OF.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.333
BECAUSE WHILE THEIR MISSILES MAY

09:12.333 --> 09:14.033
BE ABLE TO REACH US, AND THEY DO

09:14.033 --> 09:15.433
HAVE NUCLEAR WARHEADS, MOST

09:15.433 --> 09:16.934
EXPERTS BELIEVE THEY DON'T YET

09:16.934 --> 09:18.800
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO RELIABLY

09:18.800 --> 09:20.934
HIT THE U.S. MAINLAND.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.500
SO THAT'S REASSURING.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.266
ALTHOUGH ON THE OTHER HAND A

09:24.266 --> 09:25.934
RECENT PENTAGON ASSESSMENT DID

09:25.934 --> 09:27.100
SUGGEST THEY COULD CROSS THAT

09:27.100 --> 09:28.934
THRESHOLD NEXT YEAR.

09:28.934 --> 09:30.600
SO IF A JOB INTERVIEWER ASKS

09:30.600 --> 09:31.834
YOU, "WHERE DO YOU SEE YOURSELF

09:31.834 --> 09:33.767
IN FIVE YEARS?"

09:33.767 --> 09:35.033
IT'S NOW PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE TO

09:35.033 --> 09:39.300
JUST SCREAM IN TERROR.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.867
LOOK, THIS IS CLEARLY A VERY

09:40.867 --> 09:42.233
SERIOUS SITUATION, REQUIRING A

09:42.233 --> 09:44.000
DEFT HAND.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.400
SADLY, THAT'S NOT WHAT IT GOT.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.367
>> Trump: "NORTH KOREA BEST NOT

09:49.367 --> 09:51.233
MAKE ANY MORE THREATS TO THE

09:51.233 --> 09:53.600
UNITED STATES.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.633
THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE AND

09:55.633 --> 09:57.500
FURY, LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER

09:57.500 --> 10:01.100
SEEN.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.433
>> John: "FIRE AND FURY"?

10:03.433 --> 10:04.567
THE ONLY WAY THAT'S NOT

10:04.567 --> 10:06.000
TERRIFYING IS IF YOU REPORT IT

10:06.000 --> 10:09.367
THE WAY ONE NEWSPAPER IN MAINE

10:09.367 --> 10:12.667
DID, SAYING "TRUMP WARNS OF FIRE

10:12.667 --> 10:13.166
AND FURRY."

10:13.166 --> 10:13.867
IN WHICH CASE TRUMP WAS

10:13.867 --> 10:14.867
THREATENING TO SEND THIS TO

10:14.867 --> 10:16.066
NORTH KOREA, WHICH IS A VERY

10:16.066 --> 10:20.133
DIFFERENT KIND OF THREAT.

10:20.133 --> 10:21.433
IN RESPONSE, NORTH KOREA

10:21.433 --> 10:22.600
ANNOUNCED PLANS TO FIRE MISSILES

10:22.600 --> 10:24.967
THAT WOULD LAND JUST OFF THE

10:24.967 --> 10:25.567
COAST OF THE US TERRITORY OF

10:25.567 --> 10:26.033
GUAM.

10:26.033 --> 10:27.200
WHICH IS FRIGHTENING -- ALTHOUGH

10:27.200 --> 10:29.400
NOT UNPRECEDENTED.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.133
THEY HAVE MADE SIMILAR THREATS

10:30.133 --> 10:31.734
BEFORE.

10:31.734 --> 10:32.900
BUT WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME,

10:32.900 --> 10:34.266
OBVIOUSLY, IS THAT WE NOW HAVE A

10:34.266 --> 10:35.600
PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE GENERAL

10:35.600 --> 10:38.200
TEMPERAMENT OF A WET CAT.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.467
AND IN RESPONSE TO THAT GUAM

10:39.467 --> 10:40.967
THREAT, TRUMP PROMPTLY DOUBLED

10:40.967 --> 10:42.967
DOWN.

10:42.967 --> 10:44.233
>> Trump: FRANKLY THE PEOPLE

10:44.233 --> 10:45.333
THAT WERE QUESTIONING THAT

10:45.333 --> 10:46.734
STATEMENT, WAS IT TOO TOUGH,

10:46.734 --> 10:48.600
MAYBE IT WASN'T TOUGH ENOUGH.

10:48.600 --> 10:49.934
IF ANYTHING, THAT STATEMENT MAY

10:49.934 --> 10:52.400
NOT BE TOUGH ENOUGH.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
>> Reporter: WHAT WOULD BE

10:53.400 --> 10:54.333
TOUGHER THAN FIRE AND FURY?

10:54.333 --> 10:54.900
>> Trump: "WELL, YOU'LL SEE,

10:54.900 --> 10:57.533
YOU'LL SEE.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.500
>> John: "YEAH WE'RE GOING TO GO

10:59.500 --> 11:00.133
WITH THAT BOMB MORE DESTRUCTIVE

11:00.133 --> 11:00.600
THAN THE NUCLEAR BOMB.

11:00.600 --> 11:00.767
WHY?

11:00.767 --> 11:01.367
I DON'T KNOW!

11:01.367 --> 11:02.166
WHO CARES THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST?

11:02.166 --> 11:03.734
SINCERELY, DONALD TRUMP.

11:03.734 --> 11:04.300
I'M NOT WRITING A LETTER I'M

11:04.300 --> 11:04.800
TALKING?

11:04.800 --> 11:05.433
SAYS YOU.

11:05.433 --> 11:09.066
FAKE NEWS. GOODBYE!"

11:09.066 --> 11:11.900
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D ASK:

11:11.900 --> 11:13.000
WHAT, EXACTLY, IS NORTH KOREA

11:13.000 --> 11:14.734
THINKING?

11:14.734 --> 11:15.967
HOW DID WE GET INTO THIS MESS?

11:15.967 --> 11:17.700
AND WHAT CAN WE POSSIBLY DO

11:17.700 --> 11:18.600
ABOUT IT?

11:18.600 --> 11:19.300
AND LET'S START BY TRYING TO

11:19.300 --> 11:20.333
UNDERSTAND JUST A LITTLE BIT

11:20.333 --> 11:21.567
MORE ABOUT NORTH KOREA.

11:21.567 --> 11:23.567
AND THAT IN ITSELF IS DIFFICULT.

11:23.567 --> 11:26.166
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST ISOLATED

11:26.166 --> 11:27.266
IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AT

11:27.266 --> 11:28.333
ALL, IT'S PROBABLY JUST THAT

11:28.333 --> 11:30.033
THEY HAVE A WACKY TOTALITARIAN

11:30.033 --> 11:31.967
LEADER WHO LOVES MILITARY

11:31.967 --> 11:34.400
PARADES AND DENNIS RODMAN, AND

11:34.400 --> 11:35.567
WHO REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT SETH

11:35.567 --> 11:36.700
ROGEN MOVIE ABOUT HIS

11:36.700 --> 11:38.934
ASSASSINATION.

11:38.934 --> 11:40.200
AND IT CAN BE HARD TO TRUST ANY

11:40.200 --> 11:42.233
INFORMATION ABOUT NORTH KOREA,

11:42.233 --> 11:43.600
BECAUSE LOTS OF IT IS

11:43.600 --> 11:45.567
INACCURATE, FOR MANY REASONS.

11:45.567 --> 11:46.567
FIRST, THERE'S THE OUTRIGHT

11:46.567 --> 11:47.834
STATE PROPAGANDA, WHICH

11:47.834 --> 11:49.734
GLORIFIES NORTH KOREA'S LEADERS,

11:49.734 --> 11:51.700
THE KIM FAMILY.

11:51.700 --> 11:52.934
LAST YEAR, WE SHOWED YOU WESTERN

11:52.934 --> 11:54.233
JOURNALISTS BEING TAKEN ON A

11:54.233 --> 11:56.467
TOUR OF A HISTORIC TARGET RANGE,

11:56.467 --> 11:57.567
WHERE THEY LEARNED SOMETHING

11:57.567 --> 11:58.934
SUSPICIOUSLY REMARKABLE ABOUT

11:58.934 --> 12:01.200
KIM JONG UN'S FATHER.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.066
>> Woman: COMRADE KIM JONG-IL

12:02.066 --> 12:04.000
SHOT THREE BULLETS AND THREE OF

12:04.000 --> 12:05.033
THEM GOT BULLS-EYE.

12:05.033 --> 12:05.633
>> Adriana Diaz: THEY ALL GOT

12:05.633 --> 12:06.133
BULLS-EYE?

12:06.133 --> 12:06.767
>> Woman: MM-HMM.

12:06.767 --> 12:07.400
>> Adriana Diaz: AND HOW OLD WAS

12:07.400 --> 12:08.100
HE AT THE TIME?

12:08.100 --> 12:09.467
>> Woman: HE WAS 7-YEAR-OLD.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.066
>> Adriana Diaz: A 7-YEAR-OLD

12:10.066 --> 12:11.000
GOT THREE BULLS-EYES?

12:11.000 --> 12:11.767
>> Woman: MM-HMM, YEAH.

12:11.767 --> 12:12.400
>> Adriana Diaz: THAT'S PRETTY

12:12.400 --> 12:12.800
IMPRESSIVE.

12:12.800 --> 12:18.133
>> Woman: MM-HMM.

12:18.133 --> 12:19.767
>> John: WOW, THAT IS THE MM-HMM

12:19.767 --> 12:21.000
OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO SHUT

12:21.000 --> 12:23.200
DOWN A CONVERSATION.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.066
SHE SOUNDS LIKE A PARENT

12:24.066 --> 12:25.200
FIELDING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE

12:25.200 --> 12:26.500
BABIES COME FROM.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.166
"SO, A STORK BRINGS THE BABY?"

12:28.166 --> 12:29.500
"MM-HMM."

12:29.500 --> 12:30.333
"IT CARRIES AN EIGHT-POUND BABY

12:30.333 --> 12:32.100
THROUGH THE AIR IN ITS MOUTH?"

12:32.100 --> 12:33.300
"MM-HMM."

12:33.300 --> 12:34.367
"ISN'T THAT DANGEROUS?"

12:34.367 --> 12:35.266
"MM-HMM."

12:35.266 --> 12:37.300
"WHERE DOES THE STORK GET THEM?"

12:37.300 --> 12:38.633
"STORKS FUCK!

12:38.633 --> 12:43.133
THEY FUCK EACH OTHER!

12:43.133 --> 12:43.700
THEY FUCK EACH OTHER!

12:43.700 --> 12:44.300
AND THE BABY COMES OUT OF THE

12:44.300 --> 12:44.667
STORK'S VAGINA!"

12:44.667 --> 12:46.166
DON'T ASK FOR THE TRUTH IF YOU

12:46.166 --> 12:52.433
CAN'T HANDLE IT!

12:52.433 --> 12:53.266
BUT INACCURACIES LIKE THAT ARE

12:53.266 --> 12:54.900
EASY TO SPOT.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.033
WHAT'S TRICKIER IS THAT A LOT OF

12:56.033 --> 12:57.300
EYE-CATCHING WESTERN REPORTING

12:57.300 --> 12:58.433
ABOUT NORTH KOREA CAN BE SHAKILY

12:58.433 --> 13:00.900
SOURCED, LIKE THIS ONE:

13:00.900 --> 13:02.066
>> Reid: THE BBC REPORTS ALL OF

13:02.066 --> 13:03.667
THE MEN IN THE HERMIT KINGDOM

13:03.667 --> 13:05.166
MUST NOW SPORT THE SAME HAIRCUT

13:05.166 --> 13:07.834
AS THE DEAR LEADER, KIM JONG-UN.

13:07.834 --> 13:09.000
HIS LOOK WAS KNOWN AS THE

13:09.000 --> 13:10.700
CHINESE SMUGGLER HAIRCUT NOT TOO

13:10.700 --> 13:12.166
LONG AGO IN THE REGION, BUT NOW

13:12.166 --> 13:13.600
IT WILL BE KNOWN AS THE HAIRCUT

13:13.600 --> 13:14.567
EVERY MAN IN NORTH KOREA MUST

13:14.567 --> 13:15.700
HAVE.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.900
LUCKY THEM.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.433
>> John: HERE'S THE THING:

13:19.433 --> 13:20.900
THERE'S NO SOLID EVIDENCE THAT

13:20.900 --> 13:22.166
STORY'S TRUE.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.633
BUT IT'S SEDUCTIVE, BECAUSE IT

13:23.633 --> 13:25.333
SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE.

13:25.333 --> 13:26.367
LIKE IF YOU SAW THE HEADLINE:

13:26.367 --> 13:27.400
"TRUMP TO NATO: I INVENTED

13:27.400 --> 13:28.767
SQUIRRELS."

13:28.767 --> 13:30.100
YOU'D BELIEVE IT, BECAUSE IT

13:30.100 --> 13:31.266
SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING HE'D HAVE

13:31.266 --> 13:32.934
CLAIMED, EVEN THOUGH - AS OF

13:32.934 --> 13:35.700
THIS TAPING - HE HAS NOT.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.300
AND WHILE IT MAY NOT BE TRUE

13:37.300 --> 13:38.834
THAT ALL MEN HAD TO GET THE SAME

13:38.834 --> 13:40.266
HAIRCUT AS KIM JONG UN, STATE TV

13:40.266 --> 13:42.000
DID RUN A SERIES CALLED "LET US

13:42.000 --> 13:43.667
TRIM OUR HAIR IN ACCORDANCE WITH

13:43.667 --> 13:45.834
SOCIALIST LIFESTYLE".

13:45.834 --> 13:47.600
AND IT'S WEIRD WHEN A VERIFIABLE

13:47.600 --> 13:48.934
TRUTH IS ALMOST AS STRANGE AS A

13:48.934 --> 13:51.467
WILD RUMOR.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.400
IT'S LIKE HOW THE "RICHARD GERE

13:52.400 --> 13:54.266
PUT A GERBIL IN HIS ASS" STORY

13:54.266 --> 13:56.066
IS COMPLETELY FALSE, BUT WHAT IF

13:56.066 --> 13:57.567
THE TRUTH WAS THAT HE ENGAGED IN

13:57.567 --> 13:59.734
CONSENSUAL MUTUAL ANAL PLAY WITH

13:59.734 --> 14:00.900
A CHINCHILLA?

14:00.900 --> 14:02.867
THAT WOULD STILL BE BIZARRE; YOU

14:02.867 --> 14:03.600
WOULDN'T HAVE TO EXAGGERATE

14:03.600 --> 14:05.934
THAT.

14:05.934 --> 14:07.000
AND SOMETIMES, THE TRUTH ABOUT

14:07.000 --> 14:08.467
LIFE IN NORTH KOREA CAN BE JUST

14:08.467 --> 14:09.934
AS STRIKING AS THE URBAN

14:09.934 --> 14:11.266
LEGENDS.

14:11.266 --> 14:12.300
FOR INSTANCE, YOU MAY'VE SEEN

14:12.300 --> 14:13.633
CLAIMS ONLINE THAT EVERY TEACHER

14:13.633 --> 14:15.467
IN NORTH KOREA IS OBLIGATED TO

14:15.467 --> 14:17.433
PLAY THE ACCORDION.

14:17.433 --> 14:18.667
WE COULDN'T CONFIRM THAT,

14:18.667 --> 14:20.033
ALTHOUGH IN TRYING TO, WE

14:20.033 --> 14:22.000
DISCOVERED THAT NORTH KOREA DOES

14:22.000 --> 14:23.367
LOVE THE ACCORDION TO A

14:23.367 --> 14:25.667
SURPRISING EXTENT.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.433
THE COUNTRY IS FULL OF THEM.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.734
HERE'S AN ACCORDION FACTORY.

14:29.734 --> 14:30.467
HERE'S SCHOOLCHILDREN PLAYING

14:30.467 --> 14:31.834
THE ACCORDION.

14:31.834 --> 14:32.467
HERE'S KIM JONG UN LOOKING AT AN

14:32.467 --> 14:34.266
ACCORDION.

14:34.266 --> 14:35.834
HERE'S AN AIR COMBAT EXERCISE,

14:35.834 --> 14:37.300
WHERE THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS

14:37.300 --> 14:38.467
PILOTS AND GUESS WHAT?

14:38.467 --> 14:39.633
YEP.

14:39.633 --> 14:42.100
IT'S A FUCKING ACCORDION.

14:42.100 --> 14:42.934
THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY POPULAR

14:42.934 --> 14:44.200
SONG CALLED

YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF HOW

17:16.367 --> 17:17.567
LITTLE DEVELOPMENT THERE HAS

17:17.567 --> 17:19.533
BEEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT

17:19.533 --> 17:20.734

17:26.533 --> 17:27.166
THAT'S NORTH KOREA.

18:26.433 --> 18:28.300
THOSE CAMPS BRINGS US TO A

18:28.300 --> 18:29.166
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT TO

18:29.166 --> 18:30.300
UNDERSTAND:

18:30.300 --> 18:31.934
KIM JONG UN IS TERRIFIED OF

18:31.934 --> 18:33.433
LOSING POWER.

18:33.433 --> 18:34.700
AND WHILE WE LOVE TO PRESENT HIM

18:34.700 --> 18:36.233
AS A MADMAN, MANY EXPERTS

18:36.233 --> 18:37.467
BELIEVE HIS ACTIONS ARE

18:37.467 --> 18:38.600
MOTIVATED BY RATIONAL

18:38.600 --> 18:40.300
SELF-PRESERVATION.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.633
HE HAS SEEN LEADERS LIKE SADDAM

18:42.633 --> 18:44.867
HUSSEIN AND MOAMMAR GADHAFI

18:44.867 --> 18:45.700
SCALE BACK NUCLEAR PROGRAMS,

18:45.700 --> 18:46.967
ONLY TO BE OVERTHROWN -- EITHER

18:46.967 --> 18:48.033
BY THE U.S., OR BY THEIR OWN

18:48.033 --> 18:49.000
PEOPLE -- AND DIE GRUESOME

18:49.000 --> 18:51.166
DEATHS.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.734
DICTATORS GENERALLY DON'T END

18:52.734 --> 18:54.166
THEIR CAREERS LIKE DISGRACED

18:54.166 --> 18:55.867
AMERICAN POLITICIANS, WITH A

18:55.867 --> 18:56.800
STINT ON "DANCING WITH THE

18:56.800 --> 18:58.300
STARS" -- ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD'VE

18:58.300 --> 19:01.834
BEEN AN INCREDIBLE SEASON.

19:01.834 --> 19:02.767
SADDAM?

19:02.767 --> 19:03.934
THAT FOXTROT WAS A WEAPON OF

19:03.934 --> 19:05.500
MASS SEDUCTION.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.367
AND MOAMMAR?

19:06.367 --> 19:09.567
YOU WORKED HARD AND IT SHOWED.

19:09.567 --> 19:12.200
SO KIM JONG UN HAS CONTINUED HIS

19:12.200 --> 19:13.166
FAMILY'S "MILITARY FIRST"

19:13.166 --> 19:14.867
POLICY, SPENDING HUGE AMOUNTS OF

19:14.867 --> 19:16.200
MONEY ON WHAT IS THE FOURTH

19:16.200 --> 19:18.300
LARGEST MILITARY ON EARTH AND AN

19:18.300 --> 19:20.600
ELABORATE NUCLEAR PROGRAM, IN AN

19:20.600 --> 19:22.133
IMPOVERISHED COUNTRY WHOSE

19:22.133 --> 19:23.700
ECONOMY HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE

19:23.700 --> 19:24.633
SMALLER THAN THAT OF BIRMINGHAM,

19:24.633 --> 19:26.867
ALABAMA.

19:26.867 --> 19:27.834
AND BIRMINGHAM IS A SMALL

19:27.834 --> 19:29.200
ECONOMY.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.734
THEIR MOST NOTABLE EXPORT IS

19:30.734 --> 19:34.967
"AMERICAN IDOL" SEASON FIVE

19:34.967 --> 19:35.467
WINNER TAYLOR HICKS.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.233
NOT THAT THAT'S A BAD THING.

19:36.233 --> 19:42.433
SOUL PATROL FOREVER!

19:42.433 --> 19:43.700
SO, HOW CAN KIM JONG UN JUSTIFY

19:43.700 --> 19:44.867
THAT SPENDING?

19:44.867 --> 19:45.934
WELL, HE ARGUES THAT THE HUGE

19:45.934 --> 19:47.667
MILITARY IS THE ONLY THING

19:47.667 --> 19:49.266
STAVING OFF IMMINENT INVASION

19:49.266 --> 19:50.467
FROM A HOST OF OUTSIDERS.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.200
AND THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.333
BECAUSE THE MOST DOMINANT AND

19:54.333 --> 19:56.300
USEFUL VILLAIN IN NORTH KOREA'S

19:56.300 --> 19:57.133
NARRATIVE IS THE UNITED STATES.

19:57.133 --> 19:58.633
AND IT'S NOT LIKE IT COMES OUT

19:58.633 --> 20:00.433
OF NOWHERE.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.533
WE SIDED WITH THE SOUTH DURING

20:02.533 --> 20:03.633
THE KOREAN WAR.

20:03.633 --> 20:04.333
AND WHILE MANY AMERICANS MAY'VE

20:04.333 --> 20:05.333
FORGOTTEN JUST HOW DEVASTATING

20:05.333 --> 20:06.500
THAT WAR WAS, THE NORTH KOREANS

20:06.500 --> 20:08.200
HAVEN'T.

20:08.200 --> 20:09.900
THEY HAVE ENTIRE MUSEUMS DEVOTED

20:09.900 --> 20:12.934
TO AMERICAN WAR ATROCITIES.

20:12.934 --> 20:14.533
AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE WERE

20:14.533 --> 20:16.467
NONE -- I DON'T THINK ANY WERE

20:16.467 --> 20:20.333
QUITE AS OVER-THE-TOP AS THIS:

20:20.333 --> 20:21.633
>> IN THE LAST LIBERATION WAR,

20:21.633 --> 20:23.500
DURING OUR STRATEGIC RETREAT,

20:23.500 --> 20:25.500
THE AMERICAN HYENAS OCCUPIED THE

20:25.500 --> 20:27.734
LAND OF SHINCHON.

20:27.734 --> 20:29.300
THEY ARRESTED MIN YOUNGSHIK AND

20:29.300 --> 20:30.734
STABBED HER MUSCLES WITH A

20:30.734 --> 20:31.967
THREE-PRONGED SPEAR AND SUCKED

20:31.967 --> 20:33.767
HER FLOWING BLOOD.

20:33.767 --> 20:35.567
THEY ALSO TOOK THE FLESH FROM

20:35.567 --> 20:36.667
HER THIGHS USING A BAYONET,

20:36.667 --> 20:40.066
DIPPED IT IN SALT, AND ATE IT.

20:40.066 --> 20:40.667
>> John: IN CASE YOU WERE

20:44.033 --> 20:45.433
BUT THEY'RE $16, WHICH IS THE

20:45.433 --> 20:48.567
REAL WAR CRIME!

20:48.567 --> 20:49.800
AND THE NORTH KOREANS'

20:49.800 --> 20:50.800
INDOCTRINATION IN

20:50.800 --> 20:52.934
ANTI-AMERICANISM STARTS YOUNG,

20:52.934 --> 21:00.333
AS ONE DEFECTOR REMEMBERS.

21:00.333 --> 21:00.900
>> Yeonmi Park: IN MATH BOOK

21:00.900 --> 21:01.500
SAYS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE FOUR

21:01.500 --> 21:02.467
AMERICAN BASTARDS. YOU KILL TWO

21:02.467 --> 21:02.934
OF THEM.

21:02.934 --> 21:03.800
THEN HOW MANY AMERICAN BASTARDS

21:03.800 --> 21:04.133
LEFT TO KILL.

21:04.133 --> 21:05.467
AND AS A CHILD I HAD TO SAY,

21:05.467 --> 21:07.567
"TWO AMERICAN BASTARDS."

21:07.567 --> 21:11.433
AND THAT WAS MY EDUCATION.

21:11.433 --> 21:12.100
>> John: WOW!

21:12.100 --> 21:12.700
IT'S FASCINATING WHEN A

21:12.700 --> 21:13.900
COUNTRY'S CULTURE SEEPS INTO

21:13.900 --> 21:15.433
THEIR MATH LESSONS -- ALTHOUGH

21:15.433 --> 21:16.467
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

21:16.467 --> 21:17.533
AS A BRITISH CHILD, OUR MATH

21:17.533 --> 21:18.900
QUESTIONS WERE, "IF JOHNNY HAS

21:18.900 --> 21:20.867
TWO ARTIFACTS, AND DINESH HAS

21:20.867 --> 21:22.800
TWO ARTIFACTS, THEN HOW MANY

21:22.800 --> 21:23.567
ARTIFACTS IS JOHNNY ABOUT TO

21:23.567 --> 21:25.967
HAVE?

21:25.967 --> 21:27.033
THE ANSWER, OF COURSE: ALL THE

21:27.033 --> 21:29.000
ARTIFACTS.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
DINESH'S FAMILY CAN COME VISIT

21:30.000 --> 21:31.266
THEM IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM

21:31.266 --> 21:34.700
WHENEVER THEY'RE IN TOWN.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.333
AND THE NOTION THAT NORTH KOREA

21:36.333 --> 21:37.367
IS WORKING ON A BOMB THAT CAN

21:37.367 --> 21:39.567
"KILL ALL THE AMERICAN BASTARDS"

21:39.567 --> 21:40.567

22:07.600 --> 22:09.700

PRESENTING A THREATENING IMAGE

22:34.900 --> 22:36.700
OF AMERICANS TO ITS PEOPLE.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.934
AND SOME ACTIVISTS HAVE ACTUALLY

22:37.934 --> 22:40.133
BEEN TRYING TO UNDERMINE THAT BY

22:40.133 --> 22:41.667
SNEAKING INFORMATION INTO THE

22:41.667 --> 22:46.700
COUNTRY ON USB DRIVES.

22:46.700 --> 22:47.333
>> Kangchol Hwan: WE SEND

22:47.333 --> 22:48.133
VARIOUS CONTENT FROM STORIES ON

22:48.133 --> 22:48.900
HUMAN RIGHTS, GENERAL

22:48.900 --> 22:50.633
INFORMATION ON SOUTH KOREA, TO

22:50.633 --> 22:51.300
IMAGES DEPICTING THE AVERAGE

22:51.300 --> 22:53.600
AMERICAN.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.433
>> Karla Murthy: OR A FICTIONAL

22:54.433 --> 22:55.567
VERSION OF THE AVERAGE AMERICAN:

22:55.567 --> 22:56.600
TV SHOWS LIKE "THE MENTALIST"

22:56.600 --> 22:58.400
AND "DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES."

22:58.400 --> 22:59.700
KANG SAYS SCENES LIKE THIS ONE

22:59.700 --> 23:01.600
FROM "NCIS"--

23:01.600 --> 23:02.233
>> NCIS Detective: ANYTHING YOU

23:02.233 --> 23:03.000
SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST

23:03.000 --> 23:04.734
YOU IN A COURT OF LAW.

23:04.734 --> 23:05.433
>> Karla Murthy: -- THAT SHOW

23:05.433 --> 23:07.100
POLICE OFFICERS READING SUSPECTS

23:07.100 --> 23:07.667
THEIR RIGHTS ARE ESPECIALLY

23:07.667 --> 23:09.266
USEFUL.

23:09.266 --> 23:10.467
>> John: WELL, IF NOTHING ELSE,

23:10.467 --> 23:11.767
WE FINALLY HAVE OUR ANSWER TO

23:11.767 --> 23:13.333
THE DECADE-LONG QUESTION: "WHO

23:13.333 --> 23:16.867
THE FUCK IS WATCHING 'NCIS'?"

23:16.867 --> 23:19.433
IT'S ALL YOUR MOM'S FRIENDS, AND

23:19.433 --> 23:21.633
THE PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA.

23:21.633 --> 23:22.834
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

23:22.834 --> 23:24.066
THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR KIM

23:24.066 --> 23:25.500
JONG UN.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.934
IF PEOPLE GET A SENSE THAT THE

23:26.934 --> 23:28.266
IMAGE OF AMERICA HE HAS

23:28.266 --> 23:29.533
CAREFULLY PAINTED FOR THEM IS

23:29.533 --> 23:30.367
FALSE, HE COULD HAVE BIG

23:30.367 --> 23:32.033
PROBLEMS.

23:32.033 --> 23:32.934
AND WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND HIM IN

23:32.934 --> 23:34.066
THAT LIGHT -- AS A DICTATOR

23:34.066 --> 23:35.700
DESPERATELY HEDGING AGAINST A

23:35.700 --> 23:37.300
LOSS OF POWER -- IT'S POSSIBLE

23:37.300 --> 23:39.133
TO UNDERSTAND WHY ALL HIS RECENT

23:39.133 --> 23:40.200
THREATS AGAINST THE UNITED

23:40.200 --> 23:41.567
STATES HAVE BEEN RECKLESS, BUT,

23:41.567 --> 23:45.133
IN HIS MIND, RATIONAL.

23:45.133 --> 23:45.867
AND THAT BRINGS US TO THE KEY

23:45.867 --> 23:47.166
QUESTION:

23:47.166 --> 23:47.900
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT

23:47.900 --> 23:49.533
THIS?

23:49.533 --> 23:50.433
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, DONALD

23:50.433 --> 23:53.166
TRUMP MADE IT ALL SEEM SIMPLE.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.133
>> Trump: THEY SAID, "WOULD YOU

23:54.133 --> 23:57.033
SPEAK TO THE LEADER OF NORTH

23:57.033 --> 23:59.000
KOREA?"

23:59.000 --> 23:59.934
I SAID, "ABSOLUTELY.

23:59.934 --> 24:01.233
WHY NOT?

24:01.233 --> 24:02.633
WHY NOT?"

24:02.633 --> 24:04.200
AND THEY COME OUT, "TRUMP WOULD

24:04.200 --> 24:06.967
SPEAK TO HIM!"

24:06.967 --> 24:08.166
WHO THE HELL CARES?

24:08.166 --> 24:10.967
I'LL SPEAK TO ANYBODY.

24:10.967 --> 24:12.567
WHO KNOWS?

24:12.567 --> 24:13.867
THERE'S A TEN PERCENT OR A

24:13.867 --> 24:16.200
TWENTY PERCENT CHANCE THAT I CAN

24:16.200 --> 24:18.000
TALK HIM OUT OF THOSE DAMN

24:18.000 --> 24:19.767
NUKES, 'CAUSE WHO THE HELL WANTS

24:19.767 --> 24:21.100
HIM TO HAVE NUKES?

24:21.100 --> 24:23.133
AND THERE'S A CHANCE!

24:23.133 --> 24:25.367
>> John: EXCEPT NO, THERE REALLY

24:25.367 --> 24:26.300
ISN'T.

24:26.300 --> 24:27.767
PARTLY REMEMBER: KIM JONG-UN

24:27.767 --> 24:29.000
BELIEVES THEY ARE CRITICAL FOR

24:29.000 --> 24:30.266
HIS SURVIVAL, AND ON TOP OF

24:30.266 --> 24:31.333
THAT, DONALD TRUMP IS A SHITTY

24:31.333 --> 24:33.800
NEGOTIATOR.

24:33.800 --> 24:35.133
IN HIS SHORT PRESIDENCY, HE'S

24:35.133 --> 24:36.300
FAILED TO GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR

24:36.300 --> 24:38.567
HIS STUPID WALL, FAILED TO GET A

24:38.567 --> 24:40.000
CONGRESS HIS PARTY CONTROLS TO

24:40.000 --> 24:44.033
PASS A HEALTH CARE BILL, AND

24:44.033 --> 24:44.600
EVEN WHEN HIS ADMINISTRATION

24:44.600 --> 24:45.867
DOES GET SOMETHING DONE, IT

24:45.867 --> 24:46.433
OVERSELLS IT, LIKE WHEN THE

24:46.433 --> 24:47.433
WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCED A TRADE

24:47.433 --> 24:50.166
DEAL WITH CHINA AS "VERY BIG

24:50.166 --> 24:51.600
NEWS", "GIGANTIC", AND

24:51.600 --> 24:53.500
"HERCULEAN", BUT ITS ONE

24:53.500 --> 24:54.600
MUCH-CELEBRATED COMPONENT TURNED

24:54.600 --> 24:56.500
OUT TO BE LIFTING A BAN ON BEEF

24:56.500 --> 24:57.367
IMPORTS THAT CHINA HAD

24:57.367 --> 24:59.200
PRELIMINARILY AGREED TO LAST

24:59.200 --> 25:00.734
SEPTEMBER.

25:00.734 --> 25:03.667
SO WAY TO FUCKING GO, DONALD!

25:03.667 --> 25:05.300
WHAT A VERY BIG, HERCULEAN DEAL!

25:05.300 --> 25:06.633
THANKS TO YOU -- EXCEPT NOT

25:06.633 --> 25:08.700
ENTIRELY THANKS TO YOU --

25:08.700 --> 25:10.133
AMERICA IS NOW MARGINALLY MORE

25:10.133 --> 25:14.200
ABLE TO EXPORT BEEF AGAIN!

25:14.200 --> 25:15.333
AND SINCE TAKING OFFICE, TRUMP

25:15.333 --> 25:16.700
HAS VOICED SUPPORT FOR AN EVEN

25:16.700 --> 25:18.300
SIMPLER SOLUTION:

25:18.300 --> 25:20.934
>> Trump: CHINA IS HELPING US

25:20.934 --> 25:25.667
POSSIBLY OR PROBABLY WITH THE

25:25.667 --> 25:29.633
NORTH KOREAN SITUATION.

25:29.633 --> 25:30.600
OKAY?

25:30.600 --> 25:31.734
WHICH IS A GREAT THING.

25:31.734 --> 25:33.266
GREAT.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.333
>> John: SO, IN THE SPAN OF 14

25:34.333 --> 25:35.567
SECONDS, HE SAID THE WORD

25:35.567 --> 25:37.166
"GREAT" TWICE,

25:37.166 --> 25:38.400
HE PRONOUNCED "CHINA" WITH THREE

25:38.400 --> 25:40.600
SYLLABLES, SUGGESTED SOMEONE

25:40.600 --> 25:42.433
ELSE SHOULD DO THE WORK FOR HIM,

25:42.433 --> 25:43.934
AND THREW IN A "POSSIBLY OR

25:43.934 --> 25:44.867
PROBABLY", RENDERING THE WHOLE

25:44.867 --> 25:46.100
THING MEANINGLESS.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.400
I THINK I JUST HIT TRUMP BINGO,

25:48.400 --> 25:49.233
AND THE PRIZE I WANT IS TO GO

25:49.233 --> 25:52.333
DROWN IN A RIVER.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.834
BUT TRUMP'S IDEA OF CONVINCING

25:54.834 --> 25:56.500
CHINA TO EXERT INFLUENCE ON

25:56.500 --> 25:57.834
NORTH KOREA IS NOT INHERENTLY

25:57.834 --> 25:59.800
CRAZY -- CHINA SHARES AN

25:59.800 --> 26:01.367
800-MILE BORDER WITH NORTH

26:01.367 --> 26:02.667
KOREA, AND ACCOUNTS FOR AS MUCH

26:02.667 --> 26:03.834
AS 90 PERCENT OF NORTH KOREA'S

26:03.834 --> 26:05.767
TOTAL TRADE, SO THEY HAVE

26:05.767 --> 26:07.934
SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.433
BUT SOME ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT

26:09.433 --> 26:10.567
JUST WHAT CHINA COULD, OR IS

26:10.567 --> 26:12.567
WILLING TO, DO.

26:12.567 --> 26:13.734
TAKE SANCTIONS.

26:13.734 --> 26:14.967
THE U.N. HAVE TRIED MULTIPLE

26:14.967 --> 26:16.567
ROUNDS OF INCREASINGLY-HARSH

26:16.567 --> 26:17.800
SANCTIONS, BUT NORTH KOREA HAS

26:17.800 --> 26:22.200
FOUND EASY WAYS AROUND THEM.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.066
>> Ri Jong Ho: NORTH KOREA IS A

26:23.066 --> 26:25.100
100% STATE ENTERPRISE, SO THESE

26:25.100 --> 26:26.567
COMPANIES CHANGE THEIR NAMES THE

26:26.567 --> 26:27.734
NEXT DAY IF THEY ARE LISTED FOR

26:27.734 --> 26:28.800
SANCTIONS.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.433
THAT WAY THE COMPANY STAYS, BUT

26:30.433 --> 26:33.834
WITH DIFFERENT NAMES WHENEVER

26:33.834 --> 26:34.367
THERE ARE SANCTIONS.

26:34.367 --> 26:35.367
IF I'M INCLUDED IN THE LIST, MY

26:35.367 --> 26:36.934
NAME CAN BE CHANGED TOO.

26:36.934 --> 26:38.166
>> John: YEAH, THAT IS SOME WEAK

26:38.166 --> 26:42.066
ENFORCEMENT.

26:42.066 --> 26:43.734
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY:

26:43.734 --> 26:44.367
LET'S SAY HBO DECIDED THEY

26:44.367 --> 26:44.934
WANTED TO CANCEL THIS SHOW.

26:44.934 --> 26:45.600
THEIR HAND WOULD BE PRETTY WEAK

26:45.600 --> 26:46.367
IF I WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND THAT

26:46.367 --> 26:48.200
SIMPLY BY CHANGING THE NAME TO

26:48.200 --> 26:50.133
"EARLIER TIMES BUT NOW, STARRING

26:50.133 --> 26:57.266
SPANCE MÖRGENDÖRFFER."

26:57.266 --> 26:57.867
AND IT'S TRUE THAT CHINA COULD

26:57.867 --> 26:58.433
INCREASE ENFORCEMENT OF ITS

26:58.433 --> 27:00.734
SANCTIONS, BUT THEY'RE

27:00.734 --> 27:01.300
UNDERSTANDABLY WORRIED ABOUT

27:01.300 --> 27:02.333
WHERE IT COULD LEAD.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.000
>> Zakaria: WHAT THEY WORRY

27:03.000 --> 27:03.967
ABOUT IS, IF THEY DO THAT, WILL

27:03.967 --> 27:07.300
THE REGIME COLLAPSE?

27:07.300 --> 27:07.734
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

27:07.734 --> 27:08.300
MILLIONS OF REFUGEES POURING

27:08.300 --> 27:09.600
INTO CHINA, POSSIBLY A UNIFIED

27:09.600 --> 27:11.233
KOREA THAT IS THEN A

27:11.233 --> 27:13.033
PRO-AMERICAN COUNTRY SITTING ON

27:13.033 --> 27:14.200
THEIR SOUTHERN BORDER, WHICH,

27:14.200 --> 27:15.200
DON'T FORGET, THERE ARE 30,000

27:15.200 --> 27:17.133
AMERICAN TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA,

27:17.133 --> 27:18.667
WHICH WOULD THEN BE ON CHINA'S

27:18.667 --> 27:19.867
BORDER, AND, BY THE WAY, 15

27:19.867 --> 27:23.867
NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

27:23.867 --> 27:24.700
>> John: YOU KNOW THERE ARE A

27:24.700 --> 27:25.333
LOT OF PROBLEMS WHEN YOU END UP

27:25.333 --> 27:26.266
SAYING "AND BY THE WAY: 15

27:26.266 --> 27:27.934
NUCLEAR WEAPONS."

27:27.934 --> 27:29.934
IMAGINE IF YOU WERE A BABYSITTER

27:29.934 --> 27:31.667
"OKAY, YOU'VE GOT HIS EPIPEN,

27:31.667 --> 27:32.800
YOU KNOW ABOUT HIS NUT ALLERGY,

27:32.800 --> 27:34.467
HE NEEDS HIS INHALER EVERY HOUR

27:34.467 --> 27:35.333
AND BY THE WAY: HE HAS 15

27:35.333 --> 27:38.300
NUCLEAR WEAPONS."

27:38.300 --> 27:40.000
NOW, TRUMP'S ALSO BEEN

27:40.000 --> 27:41.166
MENTIONING MILITARY SOLUTIONS.

27:41.166 --> 27:43.100
BUT EVEN TARGETED STRIKES

27:43.100 --> 27:43.967
AGAINST WEAPONS SYSTEMS COULD

27:43.967 --> 27:46.533
GET OUT OF HAND VERY FAST.

27:46.533 --> 27:48.100
NORTH KOREA HAS AN ESTIMATED

27:48.100 --> 27:50.266
8,000 PIECES OF HEAVY ARTILLERY

27:50.266 --> 27:51.800
STATIONED JUST NORTH OF THE DMZ,

27:51.800 --> 27:54.800
WHICH IS HERE.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.033
AND THAT ARTILLERY IS CAPABLE OF

27:56.033 --> 27:57.700
REACHING SEOUL, WHICH IS 40

27:57.700 --> 27:59.433
MILES AWAY, AND IS AN AREA WITH

27:59.433 --> 28:03.233
25 MILLION PEOPLE.

28:03.233 --> 28:04.100
SO EVEN A NON-NUCLEAR WAR COULD

28:04.100 --> 28:06.000
HAVE HORRIFYING RESULTS.

28:06.000 --> 28:06.600
AND LET'S ENGAGE IN SOME TRULY

28:06.600 --> 28:08.333
MAGICAL THINKING:

28:08.333 --> 28:09.333
WHAT IF YOU COULD SOMEHOW "JUST"

28:09.333 --> 28:13.934
TAKE OUT KIM JONG UN?

28:13.934 --> 28:14.500
WELL, YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT AN

28:14.500 --> 28:16.000
IMMEDIATE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS,

28:16.000 --> 28:16.767
AS WELL AS A LEADERLESS COUNTRY

28:16.767 --> 28:17.400
WITH A POWER VACUUM AND NUCLEAR

28:17.400 --> 28:19.000
WEAPONS.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.433
AND AS WE'VE LEARNED FROM IRAQ

28:20.433 --> 28:21.233
AND AFGHANISTAN, WHEN REGIMES

28:21.233 --> 28:22.433
FALL AND THERE'S NO PLAN IN

28:22.433 --> 28:24.367
PLACE, THAT VACUUM CAN BE FILLED

28:24.367 --> 28:26.867
WITH TERRIBLE THINGS.

28:26.867 --> 28:27.967
WE DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT

28:27.967 --> 28:30.834
NORTH KOREA'S ISIS WOULD BE.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.266
EVEN JUST THE PHRASE "NORTH

28:32.266 --> 28:36.533
KOREA'S ISIS" IS TERRIFYING.

28:36.533 --> 28:37.166
IT'S LIKE SAYING "9/11'S BILL

28:37.166 --> 28:38.266
COSBY."

28:38.266 --> 28:40.200
WHAT WOULD THAT EVEN BE?

28:40.200 --> 28:40.834
I HOPE WE NEVER HAVE TO FIND

28:40.834 --> 28:43.734
OUT.

28:43.734 --> 28:45.600
SO SANCTIONS ARE NO GUARANTEE,

28:45.600 --> 28:46.400
AND MILITARY ACTION COULD BE

28:46.400 --> 28:47.533
CATASTROPHIC.

28:47.533 --> 28:48.300
AND DIPLOMACY IS GOING TO BE

28:48.300 --> 28:49.633
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, GIVEN THAT

28:49.633 --> 28:50.834
YOU USUALLY NEED TO HAVE A

28:50.834 --> 28:52.166
SPECIFIC GOAL IN MIND, AND TRUMP

28:52.166 --> 28:53.133
SEEMS TO BE MAKING ALL OF THIS

28:53.133 --> 28:57.166
UP AS HE GOES.

28:57.166 --> 28:58.300
>> Erin Burnett: "WE ARE

28:58.300 --> 28:59.333
LEARNING STUNNING NEW DETAILS

28:59.333 --> 29:00.767
ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

29:00.767 --> 29:01.333
EXTRAORDINARY FIRE AND FURY

29:01.333 --> 29:02.000
THREAT TONIGHT, MULTIPLE SOURCES

29:02.000 --> 29:03.700
TELLING CNN THE PRESIDENT

29:03.700 --> 29:04.700
ADLIBBED THOSE WORDS, THEY WERE

29:04.700 --> 29:08.000
IMPROVISED ON THE FLY.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.400
>> John: OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

29:09.400 --> 29:11.734
THAT'S JUST NOT A GOOD IDEA.

29:11.734 --> 29:12.767
AS I'M SURE SOMEONE HAS SAID TO

29:12.767 --> 29:15.433
WAYNE BRADY AT A FUNERAL MORE

29:15.433 --> 29:16.333
THAN ONCE: NOW IS NOT A GOOD

29:16.333 --> 29:19.700
TIME TO IMPROVISE.

29:19.700 --> 29:20.600
HERE'S A ONE-WORD SUGGESTION,

29:20.600 --> 29:22.200
WAYNE: MOURN.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.500
MOURN LIKE A PERSON.

29:24.500 --> 29:26.734
AND LOOK, THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE!

29:26.734 --> 29:27.700
DEEP DOWN, WE ALL ASSUMED HE WAS

29:27.700 --> 29:29.700
WINGING IT.

29:29.700 --> 29:30.800
WE'VE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO

29:30.800 --> 29:32.867
DISCOUNTING A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT

29:32.867 --> 29:34.233
COMES OUT OF HIS FACE.

29:34.233 --> 29:35.100
BUT NORTH KOREA IS LISTENING TO

29:35.100 --> 29:37.100
WHAT HE SAYS.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.166
AND THE PEOPLE THERE HAVE BEEN

29:38.166 --> 29:39.834
PRIMED FOR DECADES TO BELIEVE

29:39.834 --> 29:41.033
AMERICA IS ON THE BRINK OF AN

29:41.033 --> 29:42.300
INVASION.

29:42.300 --> 29:43.033
JUST LOOK AT THEIR GOVERNMENT'S

29:43.033 --> 29:43.967
RESPONSE TO HIS "FIRE AND FURY"

29:43.967 --> 29:46.767
LINE:

29:46.767 --> 29:49.333
>> THE AMERICAN COMMANDER IN

29:49.333 --> 29:50.734
CHIEF REMAINS STUCK AT A GOLF

29:50.734 --> 29:51.700
COURSE, OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT IS

29:51.700 --> 29:52.867
HAPPENING AND TALKING ABOUT SUCH

29:52.867 --> 29:56.166
NONSENSE AS 'FIRE AND FURY'.

29:56.166 --> 29:57.000
SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE

29:57.000 --> 29:58.000
TALKS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

29:58.000 --> 30:00.867
INCAPABLE OF RATIONAL THOUGHT,

30:00.867 --> 30:01.600
THE STRATEGIC ARMED FORCES HAS

30:01.600 --> 30:02.667
JUDGED THAT WE MUST RESPOND WITH

30:02.667 --> 30:06.000
ABSOLUTE FORCE.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.333
>> John: OKAY, JUST TO BE CLEAR:

30:07.333 --> 30:08.100
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT "STUCK" AT

30:08.100 --> 30:10.567
A GOLF COURSE.

30:10.567 --> 30:11.633
UNLESS THE CART RAN OUT OF GAS

30:11.633 --> 30:12.633
AND HE HAS TO WALK.

30:12.633 --> 30:13.633
IN WHICH CASE, YES, THE

30:13.633 --> 30:14.834
PRESIDENT IS VERY MUCH STUCK AT

30:14.834 --> 30:16.700
THE GOLF COURSE, AND MAY VERY

30:16.700 --> 30:18.433
WELL NEED TO BE AIRLIFTED OUT.

30:18.433 --> 30:20.400
SO THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: WE HAVE

30:20.400 --> 30:21.567
TWO NUCLEAR-ARMED LEADERS, WHO

30:21.567 --> 30:22.800
ARE ACCUSTOMED TO ISSUING EMPTY

30:22.800 --> 30:23.667
THREATS TO IMPRESS THEIR OWN

30:23.667 --> 30:25.266
PEOPLE, CURRENTLY GOADING EACH

30:25.266 --> 30:28.033
OTHER TOWARDS ARMAGEDDON.

30:28.033 --> 30:29.700
WHICH IS TERRIFYING.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.100
AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A

30:31.100 --> 30:31.667
SOLUTION TO THIS.

30:31.667 --> 30:33.133
BUT PART OF ME WOULD LOVE THE

30:33.133 --> 30:35.600
CHANCE TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO THE

30:35.600 --> 30:37.667
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.700
SO ON THE OFF CHANCE THAT THIS

30:39.700 --> 30:41.133
SHOW IS SMUGGLED OVER THEIR

30:41.133 --> 30:43.233
BORDER ON A USB DRIVE CRAMMED

30:43.233 --> 30:44.533
WITH NCIS EPISODES, I'LL JUST

30:44.533 --> 30:47.967
SAY THIS:

30:47.967 --> 30:49.967
HI, NORTH KOREA.

30:49.967 --> 30:51.100
YOU MAY BE HEARING SOME

30:51.100 --> 30:51.700
FRIGHTENING RHETORIC FROM OUR

30:51.700 --> 30:52.200
PRESIDENT.

30:52.200 --> 30:53.867
BUT -- IF IT HELPS -- WHEN OUR

30:53.867 --> 30:55.233
PRESIDENT SAYS WORDS, HE DOESN'T

30:55.233 --> 30:56.433
NECESSARILY MEAN WHAT THOSE

30:56.433 --> 30:58.800
WORDS MEAN.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.000
IT'S INCREDIBLY HARD TO

31:00.000 --> 31:01.133
DESCRIBE.

31:01.133 --> 31:01.834
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WRAP OUR

31:01.834 --> 31:03.700
HEADS AROUND IT OURSELVES.

31:03.700 --> 31:04.934
IT'S OUR PROBLEM, BUT IT'S KIND

31:04.934 --> 31:07.233
OF YOUR PROBLEM NOW, TOO.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.667
BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT

31:08.667 --> 31:09.900
SOME MISCONCEPTIONS.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.367
BECAUSE WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME

31:11.367 --> 31:12.700
ABOUT YOU, BUT YOU SHOULD

31:12.700 --> 31:16.500
IDEALLY KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT

31:16.500 --> 31:18.533
REMOTELY WHAT YOUR STATE

31:18.533 --> 31:19.734
PROPAGANDA IMPLIES, EITHER.

31:19.734 --> 31:21.233
WE HONESTLY DON'T SPEND OUR DAYS

31:21.233 --> 31:24.066
PLOTTING YOUR DESTRUCTION.

31:24.066 --> 31:26.667
WE SPEND THEM SHARING CAT

31:26.667 --> 31:28.734
MEMES, AND SPINNING FIDGII, AND

31:28.734 --> 31:30.300
GETTING FURIOUSLY ANGRY ABOUT A

31:30.300 --> 31:31.700
SINGING BOY BARELY APPEARING IN

31:31.700 --> 31:36.400
OUR FAVORITE DRAGON SHOW.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.367
SO FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I'D LIKE

31:38.367 --> 31:39.867
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW

31:39.867 --> 31:40.867
AMERICA IS FEELING RIGHT NOW, IN

31:40.867 --> 31:42.500
A WAY THAT YOU MIGHT UNDERSTAND

31:42.500 --> 31:43.333
AND ENJOY.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.033
AND THAT'S THROUGH THE

31:44.033 --> 31:44.633

31:44.633 --> 31:45.800
ACCORDION.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.433
AND I HAVE GOOD NEWS AND BAD

31:47.433 --> 31:48.433
NEWS.

31:48.433 --> 31:50.100
THE BAD NEWS IS, I DO NOT PLAY

31:50.100 --> 31:51.767
THE ACCORDION.

31:51.767 --> 31:53.400
THE GOOD NEWS IS, I KNOW SOMEONE

31:53.400 --> 31:54.300
WHO PLAYS IT LIKE A FUCKING

ANGEL.
