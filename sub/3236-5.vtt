Breaking Bad...

00:03.026 --> 00:05.386
What if we took
the kids for a while?

00:05.564 --> 00:08.864
- This idea, was it yours?
- It was Skyler's.

00:09.395 --> 00:13.119
Michael Ehrmantraut, we're putting a
surveillance team as we speak.

00:13.235 --> 00:15.838
There is a nanny cam,
I just thought you should know.

00:15.984 --> 00:17.650
- What's your name?
- Todd.

00:19.597 --> 00:20.692
Stop!

00:20.982 --> 00:23.353
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

00:23.501 --> 00:25.353
Mr. White, what do you think?

00:25.459 --> 00:27.725
The methylamine keeps
flowing no matter what.

00:28.025 --> 00:29.611
We're just getting started.

03:12.591 --> 03:14.025
Hey, man,

03:14.059 --> 03:16.227
look at the sad sack I found
moping around the lobby.

03:16.261 --> 03:18.596
- Hey.
- Ho. Hey, there, Walt.

03:18.630 --> 03:20.131
- How you doing, buddy?
- Good.

03:20.165 --> 03:22.533
Listen, I'm sorry to drop
in on you out of the blue.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.468
- No, no, no.
- If it's a bad time, I could...

03:24.503 --> 03:27.538
No, no. I'm just kind of settling into the
new digs here. What do you think, huh?

03:27.572 --> 03:30.675
Wow.
It is very nice.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.177
- Yeah. Congratulations again.
- Yeah.

03:33.211 --> 03:35.146
- We're all very proud of you.
- Oh, well, thanks.

03:35.180 --> 03:37.848
You know, my days of chasing
dirt-balls is over.

03:37.883 --> 03:40.117
But I'll tell you what,
being a boss--

03:40.135 --> 03:41.953
own kind of grind,
you know what I'm saying?

03:41.987 --> 03:44.372
Uh, Steve,
would you mind if--

03:44.406 --> 03:47.291
I've gotta run something by
Hank, if it's all right.

03:47.326 --> 03:50.244
Yeah. Yeah, hey, somebody's
gotta go chase the bad guys.

03:50.278 --> 03:52.063
- Walt, it's a pleasure seeing you again.
- Hey.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.497
- Thanks again, Steve.
- Take care, all right?

03:53.515 --> 03:54.999
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

03:56.151 --> 03:57.785
Hey. Whoa.
Look at that.

03:57.836 --> 03:59.503
- Jesus, Walt.
- Oh.

03:59.537 --> 04:01.405
- That's nice. Let me see that.
- Yeah.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.374
Wow. That's beautiful.

04:03.408 --> 04:05.309
Was it a birthday present?

04:05.344 --> 04:06.610
Uh, yeah.

04:06.645 --> 04:08.612
Well, I mean,
not-- not really.

04:08.647 --> 04:10.414
I bought it for myself.

04:10.449 --> 04:12.016
Oh.

04:12.050 --> 04:14.218
Hey, have a seat.

04:16.088 --> 04:18.856
New car, new watch.

04:18.923 --> 04:20.757
Ah, good for you.

04:20.791 --> 04:23.527
With all the curve balls that
were thrown at you this year,

04:23.562 --> 04:25.396
you deserve to treat yourself.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.998
I mean, as long as you got

04:27.032 --> 04:29.100
the money to spend, that is.

04:29.134 --> 04:31.068
So, how's Sky?

04:31.103 --> 04:34.805
Actually, she went
to work this morning.

04:34.823 --> 04:36.574
She wanted to.

04:36.608 --> 04:38.909
She said she needed
to, you know,

04:38.944 --> 04:41.445
keep her mind occupied, and...

04:41.480 --> 04:43.848
- That's good. Great, actually.
- Yeah.

04:43.882 --> 04:45.716
I mean, as long as
you're all right with her

04:45.751 --> 04:47.351
being on her own and stuff.

04:47.386 --> 04:48.652
Yeah, well, you know,

04:48.687 --> 04:51.188
I'm right there with her
most of the time.

04:51.223 --> 04:53.758
And Mariano kind of
keeps an eye on her

04:53.792 --> 04:55.092
when I'm not, so...

04:55.127 --> 04:56.494
- Good.
- Yeah.

04:56.528 --> 04:58.562
And what about the whole idea
of talking to somebody?

04:58.597 --> 05:01.232
I mean, you know,
Marie goes off about Dave

05:01.266 --> 05:03.701
like he's a rock star shrink,
you know?

05:03.735 --> 05:05.336
They come in like zombies,

05:05.370 --> 05:06.904
out like larks,
you know what I'm saying?

05:06.938 --> 05:07.905
That's great.

05:07.939 --> 05:10.707
Actually,
she already found someone.

05:10.726 --> 05:12.910
Yeah. Peter...

05:12.944 --> 05:14.979
Uh... hmm.

05:15.013 --> 05:17.314
I don't know why I'm drawing
a blank on his last name.

05:17.349 --> 05:19.917
Peter... anyway,
he's out in Rio Rancho.

05:19.951 --> 05:22.937
He's supposed to be top notch.
Good. I'm glad you're on it.

05:22.971 --> 05:25.156
That's not something
you wanna let fester.

05:25.190 --> 05:26.991
No. No, you don't.

05:27.025 --> 05:29.026
You don't.

05:29.061 --> 05:32.863
Um, Hank,
I-- I just, uh...

05:32.898 --> 05:36.434
I wanted to thank you and Marie
for watching the kids.

05:36.468 --> 05:38.536
No, it's-- it really is--

05:38.570 --> 05:40.471
- No--
- No, it's nice of you, and...

05:40.505 --> 05:43.641
I'd like to come by tonight and
see them if that's all right.

05:43.675 --> 05:46.277
Oh, of course. What do you mean?
You don't have to ask that.

05:46.311 --> 05:48.846
It's great having them.
They're great kids.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.648
I appreciate that.

05:50.682 --> 05:52.149
I do.

05:57.656 --> 06:00.491
Something else
on your mind there, Walt?

06:00.525 --> 06:02.460
Walt, feel free to, you know...

06:10.769 --> 06:13.304
Skyler doesn't love me anymore.

06:16.007 --> 06:18.042
And I don't know
what to do, Hank.

06:18.076 --> 06:20.478
I don't.

06:20.512 --> 06:21.962
She...

06:24.850 --> 06:29.086
She says that I'm
a bad influence on the kids,

06:29.121 --> 06:31.238
and, uh,

06:31.273 --> 06:34.792
that I'm not not good for them.

06:34.826 --> 06:36.644
Aw, jeez, Walt.

06:36.678 --> 06:38.595
No.

06:38.613 --> 06:42.583
She thinks I'm a bad father.

06:42.634 --> 06:45.102
I'm sorry.

06:45.137 --> 06:46.987
Hey, I mean,

06:47.038 --> 06:48.873
Sky and you got your issues,

06:48.907 --> 06:50.691
but, uh, that there--

06:50.725 --> 06:52.743
That's-- that's...

06:52.777 --> 06:54.211
I mean, I'm no...

06:54.246 --> 06:56.847
I'm not an expert
on parenting or anything,

06:56.882 --> 06:58.532
but from where I'm sitting,

06:58.567 --> 07:00.951
I just-- I just don't
see it, you know?

07:00.986 --> 07:02.920
I mean, I...

07:02.954 --> 07:04.655
I think you're great
with the kids.

07:04.689 --> 07:06.123
I think you're great
with the kids.

07:06.158 --> 07:08.459
You're a provider, uh,

07:08.493 --> 07:11.829
a role model, you know?

07:11.863 --> 07:14.732
Hell, the guts you showed
going toe-to-toe with cancer--

07:14.766 --> 07:18.435
That alone, that's--
that's an inspiration to me, you know?

07:18.470 --> 07:21.071
No, I've made mistakes,
you know?

07:21.106 --> 07:22.389
Yeah, I know.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.708
Listen, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You want a coffee?

07:24.743 --> 07:26.810
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a cup of coffee.

07:26.845 --> 07:30.214
I'm gonna give you a moment to--
to just get it together there.

07:30.248 --> 07:31.682
Um...

07:31.716 --> 07:33.717
You want cream and sugar?

07:33.752 --> 07:35.519
Yeah. Hank, I'm sorry.

07:35.554 --> 07:37.421
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:37.455 --> 07:38.589
That...

07:38.623 --> 07:40.357
Cup of coffee, right?
All right.

07:40.392 --> 07:43.360
Just take a moment.
Take a moment.

08:36.631 --> 08:38.782
You know, you two
are really great together.

08:38.817 --> 08:41.284
Take it from me, buddy,

08:41.318 --> 08:44.554
it's always darkest
just before the dawn.

08:44.572 --> 08:46.407
Yeah.

08:49.878 --> 08:51.528
What is this place?

08:52.597 --> 08:54.365
What is this place?
What are we doing here?

08:54.399 --> 08:56.200
- Get me the table.
- I-I-I can't be here.

08:56.234 --> 08:59.370
My-- my daughter-- my little girl,
she's-- she's gonna be home soon.

08:59.404 --> 09:00.904
What?
What are you doing?

09:00.939 --> 09:02.473
Mike-- Mike-- Mike--

09:02.507 --> 09:04.408
Shut up!

09:12.684 --> 09:14.601
Give me her phone.

09:18.189 --> 09:20.124
All right, Lydia.

09:20.158 --> 09:22.693
My friends here
don't know you like I do,

09:22.727 --> 09:26.563
so they're very kindly
giving you one last chance.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.637
There's your script.
Study it.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.572
In about 30 seconds,

09:35.607 --> 09:38.642
I'm gonna dial Agent Schrader
on your line here,

09:38.677 --> 09:41.712
and you're gonna pass along this information,
and then we'll see what we see.

09:41.746 --> 09:44.448
But here are the rules...
If you yell for help,

09:44.482 --> 09:47.718
try to give the man some kind of coded
message or otherwise tip him off,

09:47.752 --> 09:50.087
I am gonna pull out my pistol

09:50.121 --> 09:52.389
and shoot you in the head.

09:52.424 --> 09:55.326
Same goes for panicking,
breaking down into tears.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.227
Remember how
you like to do that?

09:57.262 --> 09:58.595
If it happens this time,

09:58.630 --> 10:01.732
I am going
to pull my pistol out,

10:01.766 --> 10:04.902
and I am going to
shoot you in the head.

10:04.936 --> 10:07.838
Look at me, not at them.

10:07.872 --> 10:11.208
Lydia, look at me.

10:11.242 --> 10:13.811
If you make Schrader suspicious

10:13.845 --> 10:15.112
in any way,

10:15.146 --> 10:17.247
any way at all,

10:17.282 --> 10:19.316
tell me what's
gonna happen next.

10:19.351 --> 10:21.285
You'll pull out your gun
and shoot me.

10:21.319 --> 10:23.553
- And where will I shoot you?
- In the head.

10:23.571 --> 10:25.222
In the head.
That's right.

10:25.256 --> 10:27.391
And it's a pistol, not a gun.

10:27.425 --> 10:29.727
I'm expecting precision here.

10:29.761 --> 10:31.695
We up and running?

10:31.730 --> 10:34.331
Yeah.
Um, computer's set.

10:34.366 --> 10:35.599
Okay, Lydia.

10:35.633 --> 10:39.837
If you ever needed to give
the performance of a lifetime,

10:39.871 --> 10:42.539
it's now.

10:42.573 --> 10:44.608
You're up.

10:46.978 --> 10:48.879
<i>ASAC's office.</i>

10:48.913 --> 10:51.882
Hi. Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
calling for Agent Schrader.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.118
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>What's this regarding?</i>

10:54.152 --> 10:58.055
Madrigal Electromotive.
Lydia. Rodarte. Quayle.

10:58.089 --> 11:00.307
Hold, please.

11:00.358 --> 11:04.361
Hank, Lydia Rodarte-Quayle
on line one.

11:07.298 --> 11:09.600
Hank Schrader.
How can I help you, Ms. Quayle?

11:09.634 --> 11:12.936
Well, this is kind of
an odd, uh...

11:12.971 --> 11:14.972
It's just that I
was in our warehouse,

11:15.006 --> 11:16.907
supervising a shipment
of chemicals,

11:16.941 --> 11:19.076
when I noticed a device

11:19.110 --> 11:21.678
<i>on the bottom of one of our
barrels of methylamine.</i>

11:21.713 --> 11:23.814
- A device?
<i>- Yeah. I-I guess</i>

11:23.848 --> 11:25.115
you'd call it that.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.750
I'm certainly no expert,

11:26.785 --> 11:30.387
but it-- it looks to me
like some kind of a--

11:30.422 --> 11:33.390
a tracking device
or-- or a GPS.

11:33.425 --> 11:36.427
- Huh.
<i>- So I was just wondering</i>

11:36.461 --> 11:38.162
if maybe your people
put it there.

11:38.196 --> 11:39.696
Not that it's
any of my business,

11:39.731 --> 11:41.665
but the last thing
I wanna do is interfere

11:41.699 --> 11:45.536
with a law enforcement operation
or a sting...

11:45.570 --> 11:47.905
or whatever you call it.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.340
So, I don't know.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.542
Maybe you could
give me some guidance?

11:52.560 --> 11:54.978
Uh, well, I'll tell you what.

11:55.013 --> 11:57.197
Set that barrel aside for me,
if you would,

11:57.232 --> 11:59.683
and I'll look into it
and get back to you.

11:59.717 --> 12:02.820
And in the meantime,
mum's the word, all right?

12:02.854 --> 12:05.239
Yeah. All right.
Sure thing.

12:05.290 --> 12:07.491
<i>Okay, great.
Thanks for the call, Ms. quayle.</i>

12:07.525 --> 12:09.610
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

12:15.700 --> 12:18.602
Hey, Gomie, come here,
would ya?

12:18.636 --> 12:19.870
- Yeah?
- Hey, man.

12:19.904 --> 12:21.839
<i>You don't know anything</i>
<i>about GPS trackers</i>

12:21.873 --> 12:23.740
<i>on a methylamine barrel,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

12:23.775 --> 12:25.692
<i>Madrigal Houston</i>
<i>I'm talking about.</i>

12:25.727 --> 12:28.579
<i>No. Nobody from my
team planted anything. Why?</i>

12:28.613 --> 12:31.615
<i>Oh, I don't know.</i>
<i>I figured as much.</i>

12:31.649 --> 12:34.451
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

12:34.486 --> 12:37.454
I-I know what you're thinking,
but I didn't do it.

12:37.489 --> 12:39.306
I'm telling you,
I didn't plant that thing.

12:39.357 --> 12:40.357
Shut up.

12:40.391 --> 12:42.893
And there you have it,
like I said.

12:42.911 --> 12:45.212
All right.
So now what?

12:45.246 --> 12:46.730
It's not the DEA's,

12:46.764 --> 12:49.183
so Schrader's probably thinking
some crew planted it,

12:49.234 --> 12:51.201
looking for a weak spot
to pull a heist.

12:51.236 --> 12:53.787
He's gonna send a team
over to that warehouse.

12:53.838 --> 12:55.639
He's gonna wire it
out the wazoo--

12:55.673 --> 12:57.524
Bugs, cameras,
the whole nine yards.

12:57.575 --> 12:59.209
So the warehouse is too hot.

12:59.244 --> 13:01.678
Her supply
is useless to us now.

13:01.713 --> 13:05.048
It depends on how fast Schrader
can get his guys there.

13:05.083 --> 13:07.484
We're 900 miles closer,
after all.

13:07.519 --> 13:10.754
I say we keep listening,
suss out how much time we have.

13:10.788 --> 13:13.357
If it's at least 12 hours,
then we head down there,

13:13.391 --> 13:15.259
use her security code
to gain access,

13:15.293 --> 13:17.594
and we take every barrel
we can get our hands on.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.363
U-haul can only take
six or seven

13:19.397 --> 13:20.764
before the suspension
gives out.

13:20.798 --> 13:22.165
It's a stopgap.

13:22.183 --> 13:23.967
But right now,
it's the best we can do.

13:26.137 --> 13:28.505
Well, what about her?

13:28.540 --> 13:31.775
You two drive

13:31.809 --> 13:34.378
the barrels back tonight.

13:34.412 --> 13:36.346
I'll deal with her.

13:36.381 --> 13:39.366
No! No, no, no.
You're making a mistake.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.419
This-- this was not me!
I swear to God I didn't do it!

13:42.453 --> 13:44.655
I don't know, man. It sounds like
she's telling the truth to me.

13:44.689 --> 13:47.925
She has a gun to her head, kid.

13:47.959 --> 13:50.527
Everyone sounds like Meryl
Streep with a gun to their head.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.496
I'm sorry, Jesse.

13:52.530 --> 13:56.133
You're the one who wanted
to put it up to a vote.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.101
It's two against one.

13:58.136 --> 13:59.770
Okay.

13:59.804 --> 14:02.239
No. No! You can't kill me!
Come on!

14:02.273 --> 14:04.541
I swear I didn't do anything!

14:04.576 --> 14:07.461
<i>Hey, Janice, give me Doughty
in the Houston office, will you?</i>

14:07.512 --> 14:09.546
<i>You got it.</i>

14:17.188 --> 14:18.889
<i>He's on the line.</i>

14:18.923 --> 14:20.807
<i>Hey, Erol.
Please tell me you guys</i>

14:20.842 --> 14:22.526
<i>didn't do something</i>
<i>as lamebrained</i>

14:22.560 --> 14:24.778
<i>as put a GPS tracker</i>
<i>on the outside</i>

14:24.812 --> 14:26.429
<i>of a barrel</i>
<i>of methylamine--</i>

14:26.447 --> 14:29.316
<i>One earmarked for the Madrigal
warehouse in Houston?</i>

14:29.367 --> 14:31.301
<i>Uh, who's asking?</i>

14:31.336 --> 14:33.070
<i>Did someone find them?</i>

14:33.104 --> 14:34.771
<i>Jesus.</i>
<i>Are you shitting me?</i>

14:34.806 --> 14:37.441
<i>Since when do you put a GPS tracker
on the outside of a barrel?</i>

14:37.475 --> 14:39.810
<i>We didn't have time to go in
there with hazard suits, Hank.</i>

14:39.844 --> 14:41.261
<i>They were about to ship.</i>

14:41.296 --> 14:43.747
<i>We epoxied them to the bottom.</i>
<i>They were well-hidden.</i>

14:43.781 --> 14:45.816
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Well, not well-hidden enough.</i>

14:45.850 --> 14:48.168
<i>How many barrels you tag?</i>

14:48.219 --> 14:51.121
<i>All of them. All the ones that were
headed to the warehouse, anyway.</i>

14:51.155 --> 14:53.624
<i>Christ. All right.</i>

14:53.658 --> 14:55.792
<i>Well, sit tight.
Let me figure out how to play this.</i>

14:55.827 --> 14:57.477
<i>Next time, a little communication
first, all right?</i>

14:57.512 --> 14:58.895
<i>Yeah, I...</i>
<i>I'm sorry about that.</i>

14:58.929 --> 15:01.097
Asshole.

15:04.636 --> 15:08.038
Aside... aside from the fact

15:08.072 --> 15:09.606
that we almost killed
this woman,

15:09.641 --> 15:12.576
all of those barrels
are already marked.

15:12.610 --> 15:14.511
We solve the problem we can.

15:14.545 --> 15:17.447
This has not changed the
equation one iota for her.

15:17.482 --> 15:19.983
Oh, come on!
You are not seriously

15:20.018 --> 15:21.785
still considering killing me?

15:21.819 --> 15:24.888
I saved you! If it weren't for me,
we'd all be in jail right now!

15:24.922 --> 15:28.058
I hate to say it, but
she's-- she's right, Mike.

15:28.092 --> 15:31.428
She saved our asses
by finding that thing.

15:31.462 --> 15:34.564
She was saving herself.
She's a loose cannon.

15:34.599 --> 15:37.334
I am telling you, she will
turn a gun or a badge on us

15:37.368 --> 15:39.219
the first chance she gets.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.238
The woman

15:41.272 --> 15:44.474
put a hit out on me.

15:44.509 --> 15:46.410
Seriously?

15:46.444 --> 15:48.779
Wait. A hit?

15:48.813 --> 15:51.481
What?
Like the mafia?

15:51.499 --> 15:54.818
Yeah, like the mafia.

15:54.852 --> 15:57.821
Hey! You still need methylamine,
don't you? Right?

15:57.855 --> 15:59.589
You wanna talk methylamine?

15:59.624 --> 16:01.558
Then tell your partner
to stop threatening me,

16:01.592 --> 16:03.193
and let's talk.

16:03.227 --> 16:05.595
Talk about what?
You heard.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.831
You can't even get us
a single barrel.

16:07.865 --> 16:09.983
Who said anything
about barrels?

16:10.017 --> 16:13.837
I'm talking about
an ocean of the stuff.

16:20.491 --> 16:22.392
Just give him a minute,
would you?

16:22.427 --> 16:24.027
Trust him.

16:24.062 --> 16:25.462
"Trust him."

16:30.468 --> 16:33.403
Okay.
So, let's hear it.

16:33.438 --> 16:36.573
Not without a guarantee that once I
tell you how to get what you want,

16:36.607 --> 16:38.341
I won't be killed anyway.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.010
- Fine. You have my word.
- Not good enough.

16:41.028 --> 16:42.512
Look, lady--

16:42.530 --> 16:44.381
Do you have children?

16:44.415 --> 16:46.450
That has nothing
to do with this.

16:46.484 --> 16:49.986
It's not a trick question.
Why don't you just answer it?

16:50.021 --> 16:52.689
Yes, I have children.
So what?

16:52.707 --> 16:55.242
You think that somehow
because we're both parents

16:55.293 --> 16:57.411
that I won't let my partner
do what's necessary?

16:57.462 --> 16:59.746
- Swear on their lives.
- Oh, what?

16:59.797 --> 17:01.982
Swear on your children's lives
that I won't be harmed.

17:02.033 --> 17:04.201
Otherwise, how can I trust you?

17:04.234 --> 17:07.854
Look, you're
a smart businesswoman.

17:07.888 --> 17:09.839
You understand
the concept of leverage.

17:09.857 --> 17:11.290
Please don't patronize me.
I hate that.

17:11.325 --> 17:13.643
You have none.

17:16.981 --> 17:21.484
But trust has to work
both ways, Lydia.

17:21.519 --> 17:24.788
Is it true that you put
a hit out on Mike?

17:27.692 --> 17:28.792
Yes.

17:28.826 --> 17:31.060
- Why?
- I was scared.

17:32.330 --> 17:33.764
Of Mike?

17:33.798 --> 17:35.749
Not at first.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.502
There are men who used to work with
Gus Fring in custody right now.

17:38.536 --> 17:41.171
Nine of them. They know
everything about me. Everything.

17:41.205 --> 17:42.639
Some of them
even know about you,

17:42.673 --> 17:44.241
assuming you're
the master chemist

17:44.275 --> 17:45.976
they're always talking about.

17:47.411 --> 17:51.214
And if it's these nine
that you're worried about,

17:51.232 --> 17:53.316
why put the hit on Mike?

17:53.351 --> 17:55.252
I had no choice.
I'm not going to prison

17:55.286 --> 17:57.387
and have my daughter raised
in some horrible group home.

17:57.421 --> 17:59.422
Do you have any idea
what those places are like?

17:59.457 --> 18:01.625
I gave him a list of names,

18:01.659 --> 18:03.860
but instead of handling it,
he's protecting them.

18:03.895 --> 18:05.562
So I hired someone else.
At that point,

18:05.596 --> 18:08.532
there was no option
but to add Mike to the list.

18:13.337 --> 18:16.506
This ocean of methylamine

18:16.540 --> 18:20.360
that you claim
you can get your hands on,

18:20.394 --> 18:23.613
how much are we
talking about, literally?

18:23.631 --> 18:26.650
How does 24,000 gallons sound?

18:29.821 --> 18:31.955
Once a week, on a Wednesday,

18:31.989 --> 18:33.924
a freight train
leaves the port of Long Beach

18:33.958 --> 18:36.159
loaded with
industrial chemicals.

18:36.194 --> 18:38.929
There's always at least one
tanker car full of methylamine,

18:38.963 --> 18:41.264
which we import from
a manufacturer in Guangzhou.

18:41.299 --> 18:44.184
The train travels east
through Arizona,

18:44.218 --> 18:46.553
stops at a rail yard
outside Flagstaff

18:46.604 --> 18:48.522
where it gets broken down
and rebuilt.

18:48.556 --> 18:50.273
But the methylamine
always moves on,

18:50.308 --> 18:52.809
destined for our pesticide
concerns in Texas and Oklahoma.

18:52.844 --> 18:55.712
Which means that it passes
right through your home state.

18:55.746 --> 18:58.715
There's a remote
three-mile stretch here,

18:58.749 --> 19:00.684
in Mckinley County.

19:00.718 --> 19:02.686
That's where you do it.

19:04.155 --> 19:06.439
That's where
we do what, exactly?

19:06.490 --> 19:07.908
Get your methylamine.

19:07.942 --> 19:11.161
Like, rob it?
Like Jesse James?

19:11.195 --> 19:13.997
You want the stuff? I'm offering you
enough to fill a swimming pool.

19:14.031 --> 19:17.601
You are offering us a quick trip to prison.
That's what I'm hearing.

19:17.635 --> 19:20.053
Stopping a train, post 9/11?

19:20.104 --> 19:22.088
You have any idea
how many alarms

19:22.123 --> 19:24.507
that's gonna set off
between here and D.C.?

19:24.542 --> 19:26.576
None, if you do it right here.

19:26.611 --> 19:28.545
If a freight train
is stopped in transit

19:28.579 --> 19:30.647
anywhere other than
the usual yards or depots--

19:30.681 --> 19:32.849
Absolutely, a signal
will automatically alarm

19:32.883 --> 19:35.051
the FRA and the TSA
Surface Division

19:35.086 --> 19:36.853
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

19:36.888 --> 19:38.588
But what you don't know,
and I do,

19:38.623 --> 19:41.791
because my job requires me to keep
track of my buyers' shipments--

19:41.826 --> 19:43.960
This is dark territory.

19:43.995 --> 19:46.596
- What's that?
- Train-speak for an area of no contact.

19:46.631 --> 19:48.498
It's a dead zone.

19:48.532 --> 19:50.250
No automated
supervision system,

19:50.301 --> 19:52.836
no alarms,
no contact with control.

19:52.870 --> 19:54.738
What about cell phones?

19:54.772 --> 19:56.973
- Crew could just call the cops.
- No cellular either.

19:57.008 --> 20:00.076
I'm telling you,
it's the perfect place.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.412
You'd have time enough
to stop the train,

20:02.446 --> 20:04.781
siphon off as much methylamine
as you can carry,

20:04.815 --> 20:06.249
and get away
before the police--

20:06.267 --> 20:08.184
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

20:08.218 --> 20:10.987
Assuming we can stop
a moving train,

20:11.021 --> 20:12.989
how do we know
we have the right one?

20:13.024 --> 20:14.991
And which tanker car is which?

20:15.026 --> 20:17.193
I can't believe that they
would advertise their contents.

20:17.228 --> 20:19.796
Once the train
gets rebuilt in Flagstaff,

20:19.830 --> 20:22.465
a final manifest gets uploaded
to my company's server.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.802
I'll have it for you sometime
between midnight and 2:00 A.M.

20:25.836 --> 20:28.204
That'll give you at least
six hours of lead time.

20:28.239 --> 20:29.973
Keep in mind,

20:30.007 --> 20:32.876
I'm taking a huge risk
supplying this information.

20:32.910 --> 20:34.945
I expect to be paid.

20:36.981 --> 20:39.215
W-we can talk
percentages later.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.618
You know what this means,
don't you?

20:41.652 --> 20:43.486
We've gotta off the crew.

20:43.521 --> 20:45.188
How do you figure?

20:45.222 --> 20:47.223
Well, if we don't, the
engineer's gonna call the cops

20:47.258 --> 20:49.192
as soon as he
gets out of the dead zone.

20:49.226 --> 20:51.728
- It's only three miles long.
- But we're way out in the boonies.

20:51.762 --> 20:53.630
I don't care
if it's in the Gobi desert.

20:53.664 --> 20:56.900
Once they get word,
the FBI and Homeland Security

20:56.934 --> 20:58.702
are gonna swoop down
with choppers on us

20:58.736 --> 21:00.337
so fast it'll make
our heads spin.

21:00.371 --> 21:03.006
And there is no hiding
in that open country.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.908
- How many in the crew?
- Just two--

21:04.942 --> 21:06.409
An engineer and a conductor.

21:06.443 --> 21:08.211
Assuming there are
no security guards.

21:08.245 --> 21:11.398
No guards. It's not like we're
carrying nuclear warheads.

21:11.449 --> 21:13.366
Wait. Two guys.

21:13.401 --> 21:15.485
Can't we just
tie them up or something?

21:15.519 --> 21:18.088
And then what?
Even if we wear a mask,

21:18.122 --> 21:20.623
we're leaving
two witnesses behind.

21:20.658 --> 21:22.425
Bottom line,

21:22.460 --> 21:24.361
I have done this
long enough to know

21:24.395 --> 21:27.063
that there are
two kinds of heists:

21:27.098 --> 21:29.966
Those where the guys
get away with it

21:30.001 --> 21:32.452
and those that leave witnesses.

21:32.503 --> 21:34.537
Give me a break.

21:34.572 --> 21:36.439
You guys were gonna murder me.

21:36.474 --> 21:39.142
I thought
you were professionals.

21:41.545 --> 21:44.714
Can you say "ASAC"?

21:44.749 --> 21:47.150
"Aaay-SAC."
Can you say that?

21:47.184 --> 21:49.869
Say,
"ASAC Schrader."

21:49.904 --> 21:51.688
If those turn out
to be her first words,

21:51.722 --> 21:53.356
I will beat you with my shoe.

21:53.391 --> 21:55.225
Don't listen to him, Holly.

21:55.259 --> 21:57.727
Aw, I'm just telling it
like it is, babe.

21:57.762 --> 22:00.163
Boss man.
I'm the boss man.

22:00.197 --> 22:02.032
Say, "boss man."

22:02.066 --> 22:04.617
Am I the boss man?
I'm the boss.

22:04.652 --> 22:06.619
Hey, that better be
something from a boob

22:06.654 --> 22:08.538
instead of some fake soy crap.

22:08.572 --> 22:11.007
- Yeah, yeah.
- My little girl--

22:11.041 --> 22:13.359
- Your little girl. Oh.
- ...deserves the real McCoy.

22:14.528 --> 22:15.829
- Oh, no. See?
- Okay.

22:15.863 --> 22:18.665
She doesn't want it.
No, she wants me.

22:18.716 --> 22:21.051
She wants me.

22:22.436 --> 22:25.955
Yeah, my little girl,
'cause I'm not giving her back.

22:25.990 --> 22:27.290
Yeah, I know.

22:27.324 --> 22:29.392
What about emo McGee?

22:29.427 --> 22:31.528
Has he come out
of his room today?

22:31.562 --> 22:32.829
Barely.

22:32.863 --> 22:34.597
When he does, he barely talks.

22:34.632 --> 22:36.850
Yeah, well, what do
you expect, you know?

22:36.901 --> 22:39.936
His parents treat him
like he's a baby there.

22:47.845 --> 22:50.847
Flynn, do you want me to
heat up some of that lasagna

22:50.881 --> 22:52.949
to hold you over till dinner?

22:52.983 --> 22:54.150
No.

22:54.185 --> 22:56.319
Hey, I picked up <i>Heat</i>
on BluRay.

22:56.353 --> 22:57.787
Wanna watch it with me later?

22:57.822 --> 22:59.389
No.

22:59.423 --> 23:02.725
And you can keep
talking about me now.

23:06.564 --> 23:09.699
Well, if no one else is gonna
offer an opinion, I will.

23:09.733 --> 23:11.601
We do it
the old-fashioned way.

23:11.635 --> 23:13.603
We hit skid row,
the Crystal Palace,

23:13.637 --> 23:15.204
all the halfway houses,

23:15.222 --> 23:16.973
scrounge up about
a dozen skells,

23:17.007 --> 23:18.942
and put them to work
smurfing cold pills.

23:18.976 --> 23:20.877
You mean switch back
to a pseudo cook.

23:20.895 --> 23:22.846
You're the chemist.
Admittedly,

23:22.880 --> 23:24.814
it's gonna
cut down on our output.

23:24.849 --> 23:27.167
Like a factor of four or five.

23:27.201 --> 23:30.587
It also means that
we will eat $80,000

23:30.621 --> 23:32.956
we just invested
in our new lab equipment,

23:32.990 --> 23:35.358
which is only good
for a P2P cook.

23:35.392 --> 23:37.794
You know, I don't have
to do the math to know

23:37.828 --> 23:40.346
that we'd be making
a fraction of the profit.

23:40.381 --> 23:45.034
And making less money
is better than making nothing.

23:45.069 --> 23:48.304
Oh, yeah, Mike?
Well, why don't you tell us why?

23:48.339 --> 23:51.541
Why is making nothing
not an option?

23:51.575 --> 23:53.176
- Walter--
- Let me tell you why.

23:53.194 --> 23:55.645
It's because of your nine
guys in lockup, right?

23:55.679 --> 23:57.614
You broke it, you pay for it.

23:57.648 --> 23:59.248
And we've talked about
this plenty already.

23:59.266 --> 24:01.351
Well, maybe we better
talk about it a little more,

24:01.385 --> 24:03.586
because what it sounds like
you're telling me, Mike,

24:03.621 --> 24:05.288
is that from now on,

24:05.322 --> 24:08.224
we have no choice but to do
this piddling pseudo cook

24:08.259 --> 24:10.360
so that we can pay back
your guys.

24:10.394 --> 24:13.546
Or else what? Or else they're gonna
rat on us, and we end up in prison.

24:13.581 --> 24:17.000
Yeah? And it sounds like
what you're telling me, Walter,

24:17.034 --> 24:19.502
is that you
wanna do this heist,

24:19.537 --> 24:22.572
even if it means killing
a couple of innocent men.

24:22.606 --> 24:24.908
That what you want?

24:24.942 --> 24:26.576
You know, I don't know why

24:26.610 --> 24:28.595
you insist on putting
words in my mouth here.

24:28.646 --> 24:30.914
What if we can
rip off that train,

24:30.948 --> 24:34.684
and no one ever knows
it got robbed?

24:47.863 --> 24:49.781
Maybe...

24:54.370 --> 24:56.971
Just maybe.

25:07.383 --> 25:09.734
It'll come from that direction.

25:36.695 --> 25:38.696
775...

25:42.451 --> 25:43.952
800...

25:45.304 --> 25:47.822
Oh.

25:47.857 --> 25:51.042
814.

25:53.212 --> 25:55.930
Wow.
Wait a minute.

26:01.837 --> 26:06.107
It's perfect!
Yeah, we do it here.

26:07.476 --> 26:09.511
We do it right here.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.957
How are we looking, Mike?

26:29.415 --> 26:31.232
All clear.

26:31.267 --> 26:32.734
<i>Copy that.</i>

26:39.675 --> 26:41.842
Go down, go down.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.511
All right.

26:43.546 --> 26:45.513
That's good, Fernando.

27:00.529 --> 27:02.197
All right.

27:04.183 --> 27:06.401
This one.

27:06.435 --> 27:07.568
Whoo.

27:11.207 --> 27:12.924
- You good?
- Yeah.

27:17.246 --> 27:19.180
- What's your name again?
- Todd.

27:19.215 --> 27:20.848
Todd, on the day,

27:20.883 --> 27:22.717
are you gonna be able
to make this climb?

27:22.751 --> 27:25.019
Yes, sir.
I'll be ready.

27:25.054 --> 27:27.055
All right.

27:27.089 --> 27:28.990
You mind if I ask you
a question?

27:29.024 --> 27:30.358
No. Go ahead.

27:30.392 --> 27:32.810
Well, I get why we want
the tank for the methylamine.

27:32.845 --> 27:35.446
But why this other one
for the water?

27:35.497 --> 27:37.498
Well...

27:37.533 --> 27:39.867
Jesse, it's your idea.

27:39.902 --> 27:41.836
You wanna fill him in?

27:41.854 --> 27:43.538
It's all about the weight, yo.

27:43.572 --> 27:45.506
The tanker
we're gonna hit--

27:45.541 --> 27:47.909
it gets weighed once when it
gets loaded in Long Beach,

27:47.943 --> 27:50.745
and then again when
it's unloaded in Texas.

27:50.779 --> 27:52.914
If the weights don't match,

27:52.948 --> 27:54.949
the train company's gonna know
it got robbed.

27:54.984 --> 27:56.451
Okay.

27:56.518 --> 27:59.254
Boosting methylamine from a
train is, like, a major rap.

27:59.288 --> 28:02.607
The point is,
no one other than us

28:02.641 --> 28:05.543
can ever know that
this robbery went down.

28:05.577 --> 28:06.994
Nobody.

28:07.012 --> 28:08.630
You got it?

28:10.833 --> 28:12.800
Yeah. Absolutely.

28:12.835 --> 28:15.019
Are you sure?

28:15.070 --> 28:16.904
Yes, sir.

28:16.938 --> 28:18.790
With all that said,

28:18.824 --> 28:21.309
the whole thing relies on us

28:21.343 --> 28:23.278
replacing the weight
of methylamine we steal

28:23.312 --> 28:24.746
with the same weight in water.

28:24.780 --> 28:26.881
Right on. So they'll never
know we hit them. Cool.

28:26.915 --> 28:29.217
Aqueous methylamine
is water-based,

28:29.251 --> 28:31.286
yet it weighs
slightly less than water.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.538
So, we will be removing

28:33.589 --> 28:36.424
a thousand gallons of methylamine
from the tanker car,

28:36.442 --> 28:37.825
but replacing it

28:37.860 --> 28:40.995
with about nine-tenths
of that volume in water,

28:41.029 --> 28:44.866
which comes to
900.24 gallons.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.768
Actually, Jesse,

28:46.802 --> 28:48.569
let's make that an even 920

28:48.604 --> 28:51.706
to account for spillage and
whatever will remain in the hose.

28:51.740 --> 28:53.408
How we doing, by the way?

28:53.442 --> 28:55.376
Uh, 850.

28:55.411 --> 28:57.412
- We're almost there.
- All right.

28:57.446 --> 28:59.314
But won't they figure out
they got robbed anyway

28:59.348 --> 29:01.048
on account of getting
watered-down methylamine?

29:01.066 --> 29:03.718
Well, out of 24,000 gallons,

29:03.736 --> 29:08.255
it'll only amount to about
four percent dilution, so...

29:08.273 --> 29:11.376
But, yes, you're right.
They will notice.

29:11.410 --> 29:15.013
At which point,
they will blame China

29:15.064 --> 29:18.649
for sending
a marginally weaker batch.

29:18.701 --> 29:22.220
Damn, you guys thought
of everything.

29:30.579 --> 29:32.613
Flynn...

29:32.648 --> 29:35.416
Flynn, open the door.

29:35.451 --> 29:38.353
Just come out and talk to me.

29:38.387 --> 29:41.589
I'm staying.
That's all I have to say.

29:46.061 --> 29:47.995
What's going on?

29:48.030 --> 29:50.798
You got what you wanted,
that's what.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.368
Congratulations.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.314
It's me. Open up.

30:09.585 --> 30:12.120
- Come on, Junior.
- I'm not gonna ask twice.

30:13.505 --> 30:14.789
What?

30:14.823 --> 30:16.824
You know what.

30:16.859 --> 30:19.660
Are you seriously kicking
me out of my own house?

30:19.695 --> 30:21.529
Are you seriously doing that?

30:21.563 --> 30:23.831
We are not kicking you
out of anywhere, son.

30:23.866 --> 30:25.333
We love you.

30:25.367 --> 30:27.769
And this is your house
as much as it is ours.

30:27.803 --> 30:30.671
But your mom and I need some
time alone, and you know that.

30:30.706 --> 30:32.123
We explained that to you.

30:32.157 --> 30:33.708
You haven't
explained jack shit.

30:33.742 --> 30:36.711
You want me out?
Explain to me why.

30:36.745 --> 30:38.612
Why do I have to go
to Uncle Hank's?

30:38.630 --> 30:41.516
Give me the exact reason,
or I'm not going anywhere.

30:43.051 --> 30:45.002
This is not gonna be a debate.

30:45.037 --> 30:46.988
What's going on?

30:47.022 --> 30:49.056
Why can't anybody
tell me anything?

30:49.074 --> 30:51.626
I want one good reason.

30:53.361 --> 30:56.564
Because we're your parents,
and you're our child.

30:56.598 --> 30:59.033
That's reason enough.
Now, please, do as I ask.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.137
Now.

31:07.209 --> 31:08.943
It'll pass.
He'll understand.

31:08.977 --> 31:11.179
Don't start, Walt.

31:11.213 --> 31:14.015
I won't change my mind
about you.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.251
Ever.

31:17.285 --> 31:19.453
Well, I don't accept that.
You're my wife.

31:19.471 --> 31:22.190
I'm not your wife,
I'm your hostage.

31:23.375 --> 31:27.294
But since you insist
on keeping me imprisoned,

31:27.312 --> 31:28.946
I'll make you a deal.

31:28.997 --> 31:32.533
I will launder your money,
I'll keep your secrets,

31:32.567 --> 31:35.369
but the kids will stay
at Hank and Marie's,

31:35.404 --> 31:38.172
where they have a chance
of being safe.

31:39.942 --> 31:43.311
Think you've seen
too many movies.

31:43.345 --> 31:47.048
Our children are not in danger.

31:47.082 --> 31:49.483
Just a couple of days ago,

31:49.501 --> 31:52.386
you told me that a man
held a gun to your head.

31:52.404 --> 31:55.223
You said it like
it was a point of pride.

31:55.257 --> 31:57.425
There's nothing you can say
that'll convince me

31:57.459 --> 32:00.328
there won't come a day that
somebody will knock on that door,

32:00.362 --> 32:03.498
looking to harm you
or me or all of us.

32:03.532 --> 32:07.485
And when that day comes,
the children cannot be here.

32:09.705 --> 32:11.906
You agree to that,

32:11.940 --> 32:13.374
and I will be

32:13.408 --> 32:16.878
whatever kind of partner
you want me to be.

32:29.725 --> 32:31.325
Okay.

32:37.165 --> 32:39.767
By the way,

32:39.801 --> 32:43.354
you're visiting a therapist
from Rio Rancho.

32:43.388 --> 32:46.473
Peter.
Last name-- up to you.

32:47.576 --> 32:49.744
Out burying bodies?

32:54.316 --> 32:56.784
Robbing a train.

33:24.026 --> 33:25.493
<i>Yeah?</i>

33:25.527 --> 33:29.130
It's me.
I've got it.

33:30.867 --> 33:33.635
Okay, Mr. White,
everything's set.

35:32.988 --> 35:34.655
Hey, Wallace!
Up ahead!

35:35.891 --> 35:38.592
Stop the train now!

35:58.147 --> 36:01.132
Stop the train!

36:18.400 --> 36:20.785
Now. Go, go, go.

36:48.730 --> 36:51.932
Jesus. Thank God you guys
weren't asleep at the switch.

36:51.950 --> 36:54.335
It'd be like pancake city
out here.

36:54.369 --> 36:56.437
Oh, man.

36:56.471 --> 36:58.539
You believe this?

36:58.574 --> 37:00.775
I mean, shit fire
and save the matches.

37:00.809 --> 37:03.411
Talk about bum luck.

37:03.445 --> 37:06.414
Hey, man, I'm sorry to put
you guys out like this.

37:06.448 --> 37:07.882
What's the trouble with it?

37:07.916 --> 37:09.984
No clue. I was just
driving down the road.

37:10.018 --> 37:12.970
All of a sudden, the old cow
just bellied up and died on me.

37:13.005 --> 37:14.922
Hey, either one of you guys
know about engines?

37:14.940 --> 37:16.224
Oh, of course you do.

37:16.258 --> 37:18.793
That's why they call you
an engineer. Right?

37:21.196 --> 37:23.414
Think it's, uh...

37:23.448 --> 37:25.366
Think it's in there
or something.

37:25.384 --> 37:26.834
- You think?
- Yeah.

37:26.869 --> 37:29.153
Probably a pretty good bet.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.607
When was the last time
you changed the oil?

37:32.641 --> 37:34.575
I don't know, man.
I just drive it.

37:35.694 --> 37:37.478
Now. Go, go, go.

37:37.513 --> 37:38.913
We're on.

38:56.942 --> 38:58.292
- Good?
- Yeah.

38:58.327 --> 38:59.627
Go!

39:21.883 --> 39:23.484
It looks good up here.

39:23.518 --> 39:25.119
How about this one?
Hold up.

39:25.153 --> 39:28.189
There it is.
I think this is the one.

39:28.223 --> 39:30.641
- We good?
- Yeah.

39:30.692 --> 39:32.943
Hey, you wanna get in there,
give it a whirl?

39:32.995 --> 39:35.196
All right.
Let me give it a try.

39:46.141 --> 39:48.059
- Ready?
- Ready.

39:50.278 --> 39:52.413
- Nothing?
- Try again.

39:55.717 --> 39:57.785
- Nothing.
- All right. Uh...

39:57.819 --> 39:59.787
Maybe if we all pushed?

40:00.906 --> 40:02.873
All right.
It's worth a try.

40:05.727 --> 40:08.145
You got any other ideas,
you just shout them out.

40:08.196 --> 40:10.114
Not at the moment, I don't.

40:12.417 --> 40:14.902
You coming?

40:14.936 --> 40:16.971
So far, so good.

40:17.939 --> 40:19.940
Give me a status.

40:19.975 --> 40:22.543
Uh, we're at

40:22.577 --> 40:25.129
300 gallons and counting.

40:27.265 --> 40:29.884
And water is going...

40:32.521 --> 40:35.389
Now.

40:35.424 --> 40:38.893
Water's going in now.
We're going with water now.

40:48.437 --> 40:49.854
- Good?
- Yeah.

40:49.888 --> 40:51.739
All right.

40:59.765 --> 41:02.249
Ready? One,

41:02.267 --> 41:04.151
two, three.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.845
You did remember
to put it in neutral, right?

41:14.896 --> 41:16.647
Yeah, man.
Give me a little credit.

41:43.308 --> 41:45.476
Uh-oh.

41:45.527 --> 41:47.561
You sure you're not out of gas?

41:47.596 --> 41:49.830
I got a full tank here.

41:49.865 --> 41:52.750
Doesn't make any sense.
Everything looks good.

41:52.801 --> 41:56.086
Why don't we just
keep going over it?

41:56.138 --> 41:58.756
There's gotta be
something loose somewhere.

42:05.614 --> 42:08.115
Damn, buddy. Picked a hell
of a place to break down.

42:08.149 --> 42:09.667
I know, right?
Crazy.

42:09.701 --> 42:11.619
Hey, you know anything
about engines?

42:11.653 --> 42:14.538
Not a whole lot.
I can push you off the tracks at least.

42:14.589 --> 42:16.990
Oh, gee, man, I wouldn't want
you to mess up your ride.

42:17.008 --> 42:19.343
I'll go slow.
Won't get a scratch.

42:19.377 --> 42:20.845
You'll screw up
your nice shiny bumper.

42:20.879 --> 42:22.996
Hey, we're running late
because of you, buddy.

42:23.014 --> 42:25.216
- The man said it was no problem.
- Yeah. Come on already.

42:25.267 --> 42:26.834
And thank you, by the way.

42:26.852 --> 42:29.520
Yeah, yeah.
Absolutely, pal. Thanks.

42:53.378 --> 42:56.964
Jesus. Walter, we've got
a good samaritan on the scene.

42:56.998 --> 42:59.466
You pull your guys
off that train right now.

42:59.501 --> 43:01.135
We're not done yet.

43:18.436 --> 43:21.355
The track is clear, Walter.
I said get outta there.

43:32.534 --> 43:34.618
Thank you, mister.
Much obliged.

43:34.669 --> 43:36.337
Glad we could
work that out for you.

43:36.371 --> 43:38.122
Yeah, no problem.

43:38.173 --> 43:40.090
You want a ride into town?

43:40.125 --> 43:42.509
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

43:48.750 --> 43:51.969
Walter, they are back
in the locomotive.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.687
<i>If you do not abort right now,</i>

43:53.722 --> 43:55.639
<i>you are gonna</i>
<i>get us all busted.</i>

44:06.568 --> 44:08.435
- Ready?
- Yeah.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.375
Mr. White...

44:19.331 --> 44:20.881
Hey!

44:20.916 --> 44:24.051
Hold it!
Hold it steady!

44:27.288 --> 44:28.505
Now!

44:33.395 --> 44:35.512
Close it up!
Close it up!

45:16.104 --> 45:17.638
Todd!

45:17.672 --> 45:20.975
Get off!
Get off!

45:54.709 --> 45:56.677
Yeah, bitch!
Oh!

45:56.711 --> 45:59.880
- We did it.
- Oh, yeah!

45:59.898 --> 46:03.734
Oh, my--

46:03.768 --> 46:06.353
Oh, yeah!

46:06.387 --> 46:07.988
Ohh!

46:41.523 --> 46:43.273
No!

46:43.308 --> 46:44.641
No! No!

No.
