23:54.033 --> 23:56.434

23:56.436 --> 23:57.968
Or maybe

23:57.970 --> 24:01.272

24:01.274 --> 24:03.073

in Amarillo as well.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.772

borrow from them

24:34.774 --> 24:36.440

24:36.442 --> 24:37.842

24:57.196 --> 24:59.163
before you got this post,

24:59.165 --> 25:01.932
I was dealing directly

Camila,
if you don't think

you had a built-in cosigner,

25:08.140 --> 25:09.707

25:09.709 --> 25:11.876
What do you mean?

25:11.878 --> 25:13.344
Your husband

25:13.346 --> 25:15.546

25:15.548 --> 25:17.381
All you have to do

25:17.383 --> 25:19.850
is tell him
to give me my money,

25:19.852 --> 25:23.187
