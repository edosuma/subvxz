WEBVTT

02:17.425 --> 02:18.676
Wait here.

02:19.177 --> 02:21.220
This is Earl Kalf's grave?

02:24.348 --> 02:26.559
May I ask why you killed him?

02:29.854 --> 02:31.439
I made a promise.

02:33.107 --> 02:35.526
I promised I'd kill him
for taking my earldom.

02:40.698 --> 02:45.369
I suppose you
would want to leave,
now that Earl Kalf is dead.

02:46.204 --> 02:47.246
No.

02:47.872 --> 02:51.209
I wish to return to Paris,
with you and Ragnar.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.048
Come here, Guthrum.

03:03.054 --> 03:04.555
I will be leaving soon.

03:05.431 --> 03:07.058
Erlendur's coming, too.

03:08.392 --> 03:12.230
I advise you to keep
your friends very close,

03:12.313 --> 03:15.233
for some of them
will die only too soon.

03:15.816 --> 03:17.485
And the others...

03:19.070 --> 03:21.405
The others will betray you.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.576
Do you understand?
Hmm.

03:31.582 --> 03:32.750
Erlendur.

03:34.669 --> 03:37.672
If you're willing to share
a boat with a lot of women,

03:37.755 --> 03:40.758
then you're welcome
to come with me to Paris.

04:07.451 --> 04:08.703
Firstly,

04:08.786 --> 04:10.621
I want to
announce that we leave

04:10.788 --> 04:12.581
for Paris in three
weeks to the day.

04:21.507 --> 04:22.967
But today is today,

04:23.342 --> 04:26.804
and we are here to perform
an important ceremony,

04:27.013 --> 04:32.310
in which my two boys,
Ubbe and Hvitserk,

04:33.936 --> 04:35.146
will receive their
sacred arm rings.

04:39.608 --> 04:41.485
Kneel.

04:48.492 --> 04:51.120
Take this offering
of earth and salt

04:51.203 --> 04:55.333
to remind you that
you belong both to
the earth and to the sea.

05:05.343 --> 05:07.803
These arm rings symbolize
your coming of age.

05:07.887 --> 05:11.223
They also bind you in loyalty
and fealty to me,

05:11.349 --> 05:13.184
your king and your father.

05:15.478 --> 05:18.022
Any oath you swear upon
these rings must be kept,

05:18.147 --> 05:21.108
or else you will sacrifice
your honor and your
place in Valhalla.

05:21.192 --> 05:22.568
Do you understand?

05:23.069 --> 05:24.070
Yes, Father.

05:24.195 --> 05:25.196
Yes, Father.

05:25.821 --> 05:27.031
Do you swear so?

05:27.156 --> 05:28.324
Yes, Father.

05:29.533 --> 05:30.659
There.

05:33.162 --> 05:34.580
Put on your rings,
my brothers!

05:44.006 --> 05:45.216
Come here.

05:55.601 --> 05:57.561
I'm taking the boys
with me to Paris.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.318
They're too young.

06:04.402 --> 06:06.445
It is my decision,
if they come or not,

06:06.570 --> 06:09.031
and they are not
too young to watch.

06:10.741 --> 06:12.868
In any case,
they're safer with me

06:12.993 --> 06:15.037
than they were
the last time with you,

06:15.121 --> 06:16.539
as I remember.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.319
Family, nobles and friends,

06:47.945 --> 06:49.989
I have summoned
you together because

06:50.114 --> 06:52.158
I have made
an important decision.

06:54.118 --> 06:55.369
Alfred.

06:58.622 --> 07:00.249
There we go.

07:03.335 --> 07:06.046
I have decided to
send my grandson,

07:06.172 --> 07:08.924
Prince Alfred,
on a pilgrimage to Rome,

07:10.259 --> 07:12.261
so that he might
see the holy city

07:12.386 --> 07:14.346
and meet His Holiness,
the Pope.

07:16.432 --> 07:18.851
This idea was given to me
by Father Prudentius,

07:18.976 --> 07:21.228
who has himself
visited the holy city

07:21.312 --> 07:23.689
and is willing to act
as Prince Alfred's guide.

07:24.607 --> 07:28.027
Now, some of you may ask,

07:28.319 --> 07:30.946
why send Alfred and
not his older brother?

07:31.030 --> 07:33.282
And my answer to you is this.

07:33.532 --> 07:36.660
We all know the circumstances
of Alfred's birth.

07:37.536 --> 07:41.707
It was my belief then,
and it is still my belief,

07:42.041 --> 07:46.128
that Alfred has been chosen
by God for great things.

07:46.795 --> 07:49.131
This journey will
be a preparation

07:49.215 --> 07:52.760
for whatever great future
our Lord has designed for him.

07:52.843 --> 07:56.889
I wish, Father, that
you had first discussed
this matter with me.

07:57.556 --> 07:59.558
The road to Rome
is filled with untold dangers.

07:59.683 --> 08:00.976
The boy is still too young.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.937
Yes, I am aware
of the dangers,

08:03.020 --> 08:06.065
that is why I also wish you
to accompany your son

08:06.190 --> 08:08.901
so that you may
protect and comfort him.

08:12.363 --> 08:13.531
My son,

08:14.281 --> 08:15.950
so devout a man as
yourself can hardly

08:16.075 --> 08:17.743
object to
undertaking a pilgrimage

08:17.868 --> 08:20.162
to the very
center of our faith,

08:20.246 --> 08:24.083
nor yet meeting in person
the descendent of St. Peter.

08:24.208 --> 08:27.419
No. But who will lead
our armies against Mercia

08:27.545 --> 08:30.548
and place its rightful
queen at her throne?

08:30.631 --> 08:32.216
Oh, be not afraid of that.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.885
I personally
will lead our armies
in that venture.

08:49.275 --> 08:51.777
How long would it
take to walk to Rome?

08:53.404 --> 08:54.405
Father.

08:58.576 --> 09:00.244
Ask him again.

09:00.828 --> 09:02.663
How long will it take?

09:02.746 --> 09:06.542
Your Highness,
we will walk for about,
uh, 12 miles a day,

09:06.625 --> 09:10.504
and the whole
journey is 1,100 miles.

09:10.921 --> 09:12.715
It will be very tiring.

09:12.798 --> 09:15.718
Only your feet will be tired,
Your Highness,

09:15.801 --> 09:18.262
but at the end of the journey,

09:18.345 --> 09:22.474
your soul will be filled
with joy and happiness.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.393
Hmm.

09:50.461 --> 09:52.713
Let me have
the stash of my medicine.

09:54.048 --> 09:57.509
You don't have to dole it out
to me like I'm a child.

10:00.012 --> 10:03.807
Hmm. But you are a child
when it comes to this stuff,

10:04.475 --> 10:09.688
and someone needs to control
what, apparently, you cannot.

10:10.481 --> 10:13.025
Then how will I get
it when I'm in Paris?

10:13.150 --> 10:16.028
It's easy. Take me with you.

10:17.863 --> 10:18.906
Um...

10:19.990 --> 10:21.575
I want to go.

10:22.868 --> 10:24.703
I don't want to stay here.

10:26.872 --> 10:29.208
You said I can do as I please,

10:29.667 --> 10:33.087
but you keep me here
like one of your
rats in a cage.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.213
No.

10:41.345 --> 10:43.514
It's the only way
you can get your medicine.

10:47.685 --> 10:50.562
And you may need me
for other things as well.

10:51.063 --> 10:53.691
What other things?

10:55.109 --> 10:56.735
I speak Frankish.

10:58.195 --> 10:59.405
Can you?

11:13.252 --> 11:15.254
Let me ask you a question.

11:21.468 --> 11:24.221
I want to know
the day that I will die.

11:25.556 --> 11:29.268
You will die on the day
that the blind man sees you.

11:32.062 --> 11:33.397
Is that true?

11:34.064 --> 11:35.733
Don't lie to me.

11:36.233 --> 11:38.986
Whether or not you
believe is up to you.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.780
But in due course,

11:42.281 --> 11:45.784
we will both know
if it is true or not.

13:08.867 --> 13:10.827
Don't waste your
time looking back.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.913
You're not going that way.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.336
Tighten the line!
Tighten the line!

13:28.804 --> 13:30.639
Hold her steady!

13:46.071 --> 13:48.115
So, Floki,

13:49.616 --> 13:51.451
how are you feeling?

13:52.286 --> 13:53.787
I feel happy.

13:55.289 --> 13:57.040
I feel among friends.

13:57.291 --> 14:01.461
That's because you are
among friends, my dear Floki.

14:02.504 --> 14:06.341
You and us, we're the same.
I feel it in my heart's core.

14:08.594 --> 14:11.346
But, uh,
tell us honestly,

14:12.764 --> 14:15.809
wouldn't you rather be
traveling with Ragnar?

14:16.893 --> 14:17.936
Huh?

14:19.730 --> 14:20.772
No.

14:21.648 --> 14:25.694
I'm here with my new friends
who love the gods
as much as I do.

14:26.653 --> 14:29.656
And would never betray them.

14:48.842 --> 14:50.385
That ring again.

14:50.469 --> 14:53.347
I don't understand.
Where did you find it?

14:55.974 --> 14:59.311
I took it from a berserker
who was sent to kill me.

15:10.072 --> 15:11.657
Now do you see?

15:47.693 --> 15:49.820
Don't be frightened.

17:53.652 --> 17:54.778
Sigurd, what is it?

17:56.071 --> 17:57.113
Nothing.

17:58.114 --> 18:01.618
Your brothers have gone.
You have no one to play with,

18:02.244 --> 18:04.496
so play with your
brother's daughter, Siggy.

18:06.623 --> 18:08.542
Do you want to go outside?

18:26.226 --> 18:27.811
You're so dirty.

18:28.186 --> 18:30.146
Don't you ever wash?

18:37.821 --> 18:39.239
Mother!

19:24.326 --> 19:25.994
Keep looking!

19:31.708 --> 19:34.878
We were blown off-course.
We have to head south.

19:37.172 --> 19:39.674
Boys, eyes out for the others!

19:52.187 --> 19:53.521
Amen.

19:54.189 --> 19:55.273
Amen.

19:55.774 --> 19:57.901
Fare you well, pilgrims.

19:58.902 --> 20:02.781
May God in his grace
keep you and console you

20:03.573 --> 20:05.617
on your long journey,

20:05.950 --> 20:08.870
and may you enjoy
its many fruits.

20:11.206 --> 20:12.415
Alfred,

20:13.500 --> 20:16.544
I will say a prayer
for you every day,

20:16.628 --> 20:19.047
but you are very fortunate.

20:19.547 --> 20:23.301
You know, when you are dirty,
you have a bath to
wipe off the dirt.

20:23.551 --> 20:27.222
Well, going on a pilgrimage
is like taking a bath
for the soul.

20:27.472 --> 20:30.225
It wipes away
the dirt from the soul.

20:34.437 --> 20:36.022
Farewell, my boy.

20:42.654 --> 20:44.656
Oh.

20:44.989 --> 20:46.449
My boy.

20:47.492 --> 20:49.160
I shall miss you.

20:49.452 --> 20:51.037
I love you.

20:54.916 --> 20:56.543
Do as your father says.

20:56.626 --> 20:58.962
And Father Prudentius.
They know best.

21:00.004 --> 21:01.423
And be good.

21:02.132 --> 21:03.508
We must go.

21:04.509 --> 21:08.054
The first step is
always the hardest.

21:42.172 --> 21:43.339
Magnus.

21:44.966 --> 21:46.634
Magnus, come here.

21:48.011 --> 21:49.345
Come here.

21:51.139 --> 21:52.348
Magnus.

21:53.183 --> 21:56.102
You are the son
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

21:56.853 --> 21:59.939
Now Ragnar Lothbrok
is a very famous man.

22:00.648 --> 22:03.026
A man who I admire greatly.

22:04.027 --> 22:06.696
I'd like to get to
know you better, Magnus.

22:07.197 --> 22:08.490
Come inside.

22:10.033 --> 22:13.870
I have some very
interesting board games
I'd like to show you.

22:32.222 --> 22:33.723
Look there!

22:37.727 --> 22:38.895
Over there.

22:41.731 --> 22:43.358
Two of our ships.

22:59.749 --> 23:01.000
Heave! Heave!

23:03.086 --> 23:04.379
Heave!

23:16.599 --> 23:17.934
Tally-ho!

23:59.058 --> 24:00.268
Ragnar.

24:06.274 --> 24:07.817
Frankish scouts.

25:21.933 --> 25:23.142
Are you lads happy?

26:03.558 --> 26:04.976
Is that you?

26:07.353 --> 26:08.604
Is that you, Harbard?

26:13.192 --> 26:14.444
Who else could it be?

26:15.945 --> 26:17.447
Why have you come back?

26:22.618 --> 26:24.287
I know how you suffer.

26:24.912 --> 26:26.748
I know all your pain.

26:28.708 --> 26:31.544
The things you
cannot tell anyone else.

26:36.132 --> 26:40.636
Come to me and I will put
an end to your suffering
and heal you

26:42.054 --> 26:43.723
and make you free.

27:27.433 --> 27:29.101
Why are we
doing this, Father?

27:31.521 --> 27:33.356
So our last boats

27:34.190 --> 27:35.399
know that we're
in front of them.

28:15.523 --> 28:19.026
Earl Ingstad,
how is my son?
How is Guthrum?

28:19.986 --> 28:21.737
Your son is healthy and well.

28:22.405 --> 28:26.492
I have no doubt that the gods
have great things
in store for him.

28:26.909 --> 28:29.912
Thank you.
That is good enough
for me to hear.

28:36.919 --> 28:38.588
Why do you ask her?

28:38.921 --> 28:40.756
Because I trust her.

28:41.757 --> 28:43.593
And I'm nothing to you?

28:44.176 --> 28:46.679
Come. We still have
much in common.

28:46.762 --> 28:48.431
Really? Is it so?

28:49.599 --> 28:51.934
We have your son in common.

28:53.936 --> 28:56.439
I don't care about
your feelings for Bjorn,

28:57.273 --> 28:59.108
because if I ask
you to kill him,

28:59.692 --> 29:01.277
you will have to do it.

29:01.736 --> 29:03.946
Otherwise I will kill the boy.

29:04.572 --> 29:07.617
And believe me,
Lagertha can't
protect your son.

29:08.367 --> 29:13.122
You thought you
were free, Torvi.
Free to choose Bjorn over me?

29:16.626 --> 29:18.294
But you never were.

29:23.966 --> 29:25.176
Ragnar!

29:40.441 --> 29:41.984
Signal fires.

29:43.653 --> 29:47.031
News of our arrival
will soon reach Paris.

29:56.123 --> 29:57.625
Come, brother.

30:03.172 --> 30:04.507
I'll take this.

30:07.969 --> 30:09.345
What are you doing?

30:09.679 --> 30:10.680
Taking them for a walk.

30:13.683 --> 30:14.892
Come.

30:20.523 --> 30:21.857
Where are you going?

30:22.274 --> 30:23.275
With my friends.

30:23.359 --> 30:26.028
What about Ragnar?
He is your friend.

30:31.033 --> 30:32.451
Not anymore, Helga.
But he's...

30:32.535 --> 30:34.328
What are you
talking about?

30:35.204 --> 30:38.040
He tortured me and shamed me.

30:39.041 --> 30:40.584
How is he my friend?

30:40.876 --> 30:42.712
He spared your life.

30:54.390 --> 30:55.558
Get up, get up!

31:11.574 --> 31:14.535
Help me understand
why you are here fighting

31:16.078 --> 31:18.873
instead of trying to
keep your baby safe.

31:29.508 --> 31:32.511
You've never spoken
to me about Kalf's death.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.264
Must've broken your heart.

31:36.432 --> 31:38.225
Of course it didn't.

31:38.309 --> 31:40.936
My heart was
broken a long time ago.

31:44.565 --> 31:47.276
I still don't understand
why you are willing

31:47.401 --> 31:50.071
to risk your baby's life
in battle.

31:52.615 --> 31:54.408
Who are you to talk?

31:54.658 --> 31:56.619
I'm not your wife.

32:00.915 --> 32:01.957
Move!

32:05.252 --> 32:07.046
Come on, come on!
Move.

32:07.129 --> 32:08.506
Move, move!
Get up!

32:08.631 --> 32:10.257
You'll give
Christians a bad name!

32:10.341 --> 32:12.760
They'll say all
Christians are fat and lazy!

32:17.389 --> 32:18.390
Stay still!

32:26.148 --> 32:27.608
Light them up.

32:33.489 --> 32:34.990
What do you think
he's saying?

32:36.867 --> 32:40.037
I expect that,
uh, they want you
to put the fire out.

32:40.162 --> 32:41.163
Help them, brother, help them.

32:41.330 --> 32:42.331
I will try, I will try.

32:49.713 --> 32:52.883
So now we've sent
another signal to Paris!

32:53.384 --> 32:55.261
A signal from the gods!

32:55.344 --> 32:57.638
Do you think they can see it?

32:57.721 --> 32:59.682
Do you think they
can understand it?

33:00.182 --> 33:01.809
Odin!

34:22.598 --> 34:24.683
The Northmen have returned,

34:24.766 --> 34:28.187
and it is said they fly
the black raven banner

34:28.270 --> 34:30.272
of King Ragnar Lothbrok.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.860
We have planned for this day.

34:34.944 --> 34:37.987
We have. His Grace and I
will now lead our forces

34:38.112 --> 34:40.157
to the two forts we
have built downriver.

34:40.282 --> 34:44.620
And from these forts,
we will defend the city,
if necessary, to the death.

34:44.954 --> 34:47.121
We are ready for the heathen.

34:47.414 --> 34:48.623
Your Grace,

34:48.958 --> 34:51.877
you are the difference between
failure and triumph.

34:51.960 --> 34:55.922
With your help,
we can frustrate
and defeat the enemy.

34:56.632 --> 34:58.634
I beg and beseech you.

34:59.760 --> 35:04.139
I actually would fall on
my knees before you.
Me, the Emperor.

35:04.473 --> 35:07.101
The grandson of
Charlemagne himself.

35:07.309 --> 35:08.477
Yes.

35:09.603 --> 35:11.146
I would beg you,

35:13.190 --> 35:15.275
for all we have given you,

35:16.652 --> 35:18.112
not to change sides.

35:18.988 --> 35:20.531
Not to betray us.

35:20.990 --> 35:23.283
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ,

35:23.659 --> 35:25.494
for the sake of Paris,

35:28.998 --> 35:31.333
do not return to your brother.

35:37.673 --> 35:39.508
I will not betray you.

35:40.676 --> 35:42.553
I will not betray Paris.

35:42.678 --> 35:44.346
And I will not betray my wife.

35:47.558 --> 35:50.519
I shall take the banner of
Saint Denis down to the forts.

35:50.853 --> 35:52.855
It will inspire our soldiers.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.898
And we shall prevail.

35:55.691 --> 35:57.026
Father, believe me.

35:58.485 --> 36:00.154
Then I am assured

36:00.654 --> 36:03.699
of your fealty
and trustworthiness,
Duke Rollo.

36:04.366 --> 36:06.035
I am persuaded.

36:07.536 --> 36:09.329
And so our victory.

36:11.331 --> 36:15.085
Of course
he will betray us if he can.

36:15.377 --> 36:19.089
Paris must never be left
to the mercies of a pagan.

36:20.382 --> 36:21.592
I thought he had
become a Christian.

36:24.595 --> 36:27.222
Do you
really believe that?

36:27.848 --> 36:31.727
Is it really possible?
Personally, I don't think so.

36:32.936 --> 36:35.647
When Ragnar appears,
when his brother appears,

36:35.731 --> 36:38.734
is it not likely that our
Duke Rollo will embrace him?

36:38.859 --> 36:41.570
Don't you think
they might have already
planned these things?

36:41.945 --> 36:43.822
I thought you needed
him to fight with you.

36:43.906 --> 36:45.407
I was wrong.

36:47.409 --> 36:49.036
He was useful to us early on.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.080
I would've got rid
of him subsequently.

36:51.205 --> 36:54.666
You see, these are
precisely the decisions
an emperor must make

36:54.750 --> 36:56.752
if he wishes to
keep his throne.

37:01.548 --> 37:03.884
Are you ready
for me to undress?

37:06.428 --> 37:07.471
Undress?

37:08.597 --> 37:10.224
No, not tonight.

37:10.933 --> 37:13.727
I will chain you up,
just as you are.

37:14.478 --> 37:16.396
If that is your will.

37:48.595 --> 37:50.639
You are treated very badly.

37:52.099 --> 37:54.935
The Emperor fawns
upon the Northman.

37:55.018 --> 37:56.145
He should trust you more.

37:58.147 --> 38:00.816
He should trust me
above the Northman.

38:03.527 --> 38:05.654
He does not know who to trust.

38:11.326 --> 38:12.828
He's an idiot.

38:14.162 --> 38:15.998
I have lost all faith.

38:16.623 --> 38:18.208
What will you do?

38:42.232 --> 38:44.318
Do I have your permission?

38:47.029 --> 38:48.906
Yes. What will you do?

38:55.245 --> 38:56.330
Strike.

38:57.915 --> 39:00.208
I will save
Paris a second time.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.544
I do not need Rollo.
I will do it myself.

39:02.628 --> 39:03.712
And then?
And then...

39:06.757 --> 39:09.301
I will organize
a coup against the Emperor.

39:09.384 --> 39:12.220
I will have him killed
and I will replace him.

39:12.304 --> 39:14.264
You will be the Emperor?

39:15.057 --> 39:18.560
Yes, I will be the Emperor.

39:18.644 --> 39:20.437
Long live the Emperor!

39:22.064 --> 39:25.567
I love it.
Long live the Emperor.

39:26.234 --> 39:27.903
Long live the Emperor.

39:56.974 --> 39:58.934
There's no sign
of Rollo's camp.

39:59.309 --> 40:00.352
No.

40:03.188 --> 40:04.940
Does that surprise you?

42:43.181 --> 42:46.184
Ivar.
Ivar, wake up.

42:46.518 --> 42:48.478
See who's here. It's Harbard.

42:50.772 --> 42:52.274
You remember Harbard,
don't you?

42:54.234 --> 42:55.402
Hello, Ivar.

42:55.986 --> 42:57.612
Blessed Ivar.

44:14.606 --> 44:15.690
Halt!

44:46.263 --> 44:48.056
Is that not Rollo?

44:48.890 --> 44:50.267
You know very well.

45:12.122 --> 45:13.290
Uncle!
