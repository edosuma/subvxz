00:05.480 --> 00:09.070
<i>Hello, my name is Sam Mendes,</i>
<i>and you have made the fateful decision...</i>

00:09.150 --> 00:12.990
<i>to press the Director's Commentary button</i>
<i>on your DVD...</i>

00:13.070 --> 00:16.820
<i>and now I'm going to bore you stupid</i>
<i>with observations about this movie...</i>

00:16.910 --> 00:19.280
<i>over the next hour and 53 minutes.</i>

00:26.920 --> 00:28.040
A story.

00:28.130 --> 00:30.340
<i>We had various ways</i>
<i>of starting this movie...</i>

00:30.420 --> 00:33.340
<i>and I think maybe in some of the</i>
<i>deleted scenes you're going to see this.</i>

00:33.420 --> 00:37.180
<i>We had a scene, upfront of the movie,</i>
<i>featuring Sam Rockwell...</i>

00:37.850 --> 00:41.720
<i>that fine actor,</i>
<i>playing a kind of composite figure...</i>

00:41.810 --> 00:45.480
<i>of Swoff's uncle and a recruiter.</i>

00:45.560 --> 00:49.820
<i>I felt we needed something to introduce</i>
<i>a comic tone at the beginning of the film...</i>

00:49.900 --> 00:51.940
<i>and something that was telling us...</i>

00:52.030 --> 00:55.070
<i>that Swoff's father and uncle</i>
<i>had fought in Vietnam.</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:58.410
<i>But, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>it felt like it was from a different movie.</i>

00:59.620 --> 01:01.490
<i>It felt like the beginning of almost</i>
<i>a Coen brothers movie...</i>

01:01.580 --> 01:03.870
<i>and I think you'll feel that</i>
<i>when you see it in the deleted scenes.</i>

01:03.950 --> 01:05.370
<i>And on the last day</i>
<i>of principal photography...</i>

01:05.459 --> 01:08.290
<i>I did a voiceover session</i>
<i>with Jake Gyllenhaal...</i>

01:08.380 --> 01:12.210
<i>and we recorded sections from the book</i>
<i>that weren't in the script.</i>

01:12.590 --> 01:15.840
<i>And one of those was this quote</i>
<i>about the Marine and his rifle...</i>

01:15.920 --> 01:18.510
<i>and that became the beginning of the film.</i>

01:19.970 --> 01:23.060
<i>Then we jump right into boot camp here,</i>
<i>which you see with Scott MacDonald.</i>

01:23.140 --> 01:25.680
<i>And this piece of dialogue</i>
<i>that you're watching right now...</i>

01:25.770 --> 01:27.230
<i>is entirely an improvisation.</i>

01:27.310 --> 01:31.860
<i>We did about 20, 25 set-ups on the first day.</i>
<i>This was the first day of the shoot.</i>

01:32.820 --> 01:34.990
<i>And we had an hour left</i>
<i>at the end of the day...</i>

01:35.070 --> 01:37.990
<i>and I said, "Let's go back</i>
<i>to that shot and just improvise. "</i>

01:38.070 --> 01:40.450
<i>And because we had rehearsed</i>
<i>for four weeks...</i>

01:40.530 --> 01:43.370
<i>and Scott MacDonald</i>
<i>had channelled the drill instructor...</i>

01:43.490 --> 01:45.950
<i>he was able to just go off like this.</i>

01:46.040 --> 01:47.540
<i>We had a drill instructor on set.</i>

01:47.620 --> 01:49.710
<i>And we had a lot of Marine advisors</i>
<i>on this movie.</i>

01:49.790 --> 01:52.210
<i>He was very good at preparing Scott...</i>

01:52.290 --> 01:56.510
<i>to play a series of mind-fuck games</i>
<i>in which there is no correct answer...</i>

01:56.590 --> 01:59.300
<i>which seems to me</i>
<i>the great art of the drill instructor.</i>

01:59.340 --> 02:01.300
<i>And that's how this dialogue arrived.</i>

02:02.810 --> 02:05.720
It was shortly after meeting
Drill Instructor Fitch...

02:05.810 --> 02:08.440
that I realised
that joining the Marine Corps...

02:08.520 --> 02:10.440
might have been a bad decision.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.820
<i>The book, by Tony Swofford,</i>
<i>features boot camp very briefly.</i>

02:14.900 --> 02:18.070
<i>There are lots of sections in the book</i>
<i>which is very impressionistic...</i>

02:18.150 --> 02:20.700
<i>which we dropped from the screenplay.</i>

02:20.780 --> 02:22.990
<i>And we decided very early on</i>
<i>to go to this boot camp.</i>

02:23.080 --> 02:26.370
<i>And, of course for me,</i>
<i>it was very difficult to get out of my mind...</i>

02:26.450 --> 02:27.870
<i>the memories of</i> Full Metal Jacket...

02:27.960 --> 02:32.210
<i>which is Kubrick's masterpiece</i>
<i>about boot camp, at least in part.</i>

02:32.290 --> 02:36.130
<i>And whatever you do</i>
<i>to this white room with the yellow lines...</i>

02:36.210 --> 02:38.050
<i>it's very difficult</i>
<i>to get that out of your mind.</i>

02:38.130 --> 02:41.180
<i>But we went for something</i>
<i>a little bit more hand-held, a little looser...</i>

02:41.260 --> 02:43.720
<i>and, at the end of the day,</i>
<i>boot camp is boot camp...</i>

02:43.800 --> 02:46.390
<i>and there's nothing you can do</i>
<i>to change the way it looks.</i>

02:46.470 --> 02:49.600
<i>Kubrick didn't invent it,</i>
<i>it was invented by the Marines.</i>

02:49.690 --> 02:53.480
<i>And when you go in there to those barracks</i>
<i>it looks exactly the same.</i>

02:54.320 --> 02:57.030
<i>One of the reasons</i>
<i>why we took out that section...</i>

02:57.110 --> 03:00.530
<i>with Sam Rockwell at the beginning</i>
<i>is boot camp turned out to be quite funny...</i>

03:00.610 --> 03:03.740
<i>in and of itself,</i>
<i>which it wasn't necessarily in the script.</i>

03:06.450 --> 03:08.290
<i>And then we jump with Swoff...</i>

03:08.370 --> 03:13.210
<i>into the bus on the way to the barracks</i>
<i>at Camp Pendleton...</i>

03:13.420 --> 03:14.460
<i>in 1989.</i>

03:14.540 --> 03:18.590
<i>This is the only time we use a caption</i>
<i>that has a specific date on it.</i>

03:19.340 --> 03:22.800
A bed was a rack.
A wall was a bulkhead.

03:22.890 --> 03:26.930
<i>I felt very much like I wanted</i>
<i>to be very accurate with the period.</i>

03:27.010 --> 03:30.350
<i>But at the same time, I didn't want to keep</i>
<i>reminding people that it was in the past...</i>

03:30.430 --> 03:32.100
<i>because there are many things that are...</i>

03:32.190 --> 03:33.980
<i>direct parallels with the present day...</i>

03:34.060 --> 03:35.690
<i>and that doesn't mean just about the war...</i>

03:35.770 --> 03:37.360
<i>but about the way</i>
<i>in which Marines are trained...</i>

03:37.440 --> 03:39.990
<i>and the places in which they are trained.</i>

03:50.200 --> 03:53.170
<i>This, as is the case</i>
<i>with many scenes in the movie...</i>

03:53.250 --> 03:56.250
<i>was a much longer scene</i>
<i>when he steps off the bus.</i>

03:56.380 --> 04:00.010
<i>We originally had Jamie Foxx's</i>
<i>first appearance in this scene...</i>

04:00.090 --> 04:03.630
<i>with his face painted with green paint,</i>
<i>looking rather scary...</i>

04:03.720 --> 04:06.930
<i>and it was the first moment</i>
<i>they had eye-to-eye contact.</i>

04:07.550 --> 04:10.270
<i>But, in the end,</i>
<i>it became part of a sequence...</i>

04:10.310 --> 04:15.100
<i>that was a very swift introduction of Swoff</i>
<i>into the world of the Marines.</i>

04:15.690 --> 04:18.649
<i>And just another feature</i>
<i>of the speed at which...</i>

04:18.730 --> 04:20.690
<i>people are supposed to acclimatise to it...</i>

04:20.779 --> 04:25.280
<i>and the, frankly, disinterest they have</i>
<i>in the notion of the individual...</i>

04:25.360 --> 04:28.780
<i>within this incredible</i>
<i>and selfless institution.</i>

04:28.910 --> 04:32.200
<i>You know, there's a reason</i>
<i>why everyone looks the same...</i>

04:32.290 --> 04:35.500
<i>has the same haircut, and there are</i>
<i>very few insignias on uniforms.</i>

04:35.580 --> 04:38.090
<i>And that is because in the psychology</i>
<i>of the Marine Corps...</i>

04:38.170 --> 04:41.510
<i>everyone is serving</i>
<i>something bigger than themselves.</i>

04:42.920 --> 04:45.130
<i>And this is Swoff arriving in the barracks...</i>

04:45.220 --> 04:48.350
<i>which is a scene</i>
<i>very vividly described in the book...</i>

04:48.470 --> 04:51.310
<i>in which they pretend to brand him...</i>

04:51.390 --> 04:54.100
<i>and humiliate him on his first day.</i>

04:54.270 --> 04:56.980
<i>And there was something very deliberate</i>
<i>about the way I shot this.</i>

04:57.020 --> 04:59.320
<i>I wanted them</i>
<i>collected at the end of the barracks...</i>

04:59.400 --> 05:02.110
<i>doing something that was slightly</i>
<i>mysterious and quite bizarre...</i>

05:02.150 --> 05:03.320
<i>like a bunch of animals.</i>

05:03.400 --> 05:07.610
<i>And Swoff walking into this very particular</i>
<i>and very charged atmosphere.</i>

05:08.910 --> 05:11.870
<i>And then to introduce Troy,</i>
<i>Peter Sarsgaard's character.</i>

05:11.950 --> 05:15.330
<i>The character who is going to be his friend</i>
<i>and his mentor...</i>

05:15.410 --> 05:17.670
<i>throughout the movie,</i>
<i>in this very offhand way.</i>

05:17.750 --> 05:19.000
<i>Almost thrown away.</i>

05:19.170 --> 05:22.710
<i>And introduce him as really quite</i>
<i>an unpleasant and violent figure...</i>

05:23.380 --> 05:26.880
<i>who, in this case,</i>
<i>binds his hands with duct tape...</i>

05:27.180 --> 05:30.390
<i>and, in fact, begins the fight</i>
<i>straight out of the gate.</i>

05:30.470 --> 05:33.560
<i>Kind of seems to give the order</i>
<i>for it to happen.</i>

05:34.520 --> 05:36.100
Hey, boys! Fresh fucking meat!

05:36.230 --> 05:37.940
-What kind of meat?
-We <i>don't</i> want you!

05:39.020 --> 05:42.110
<i>I wanted to establish that sense of status...</i>

05:42.190 --> 05:44.690
<i>and that sense of slight distance...</i>

05:44.780 --> 05:48.700
<i>that he was the person who started it</i>
<i>but wasn't in the middle of it.</i>

05:49.570 --> 05:52.120
<i>Because I felt that,</i>
<i>that was going to be important later on...</i>

05:52.200 --> 05:53.910
<i>to give him that status.</i>

05:54.160 --> 05:56.870
<i>You know, these guys were pretty amazing.</i>
<i>These are stunt guys.</i>

05:56.960 --> 06:01.670
<i>And I can honestly say, that in this scene,</i>
<i>Jake got the shit beaten out of him...</i>

06:02.000 --> 06:04.460
<i>over and over again. He was pretty bruised</i>
<i>for the next two weeks.</i>

06:04.550 --> 06:07.590
<i>Cuts on his head and, you know,</i>
<i>bruises on his arms and legs...</i>

06:07.680 --> 06:10.470
<i>and, you know, I was worried he....</i>
<i>We cracked a rib at one point.</i>

06:11.640 --> 06:15.600
<i>But Jake was very concerned throughout</i>
<i>to push himself to the limit.</i>

06:16.180 --> 06:19.850
<i>And he was willing to go there...</i>

06:19.940 --> 06:24.570
<i>and I think without that, the performance</i>
<i>wouldn't be half as good as I feel it is.</i>

06:34.660 --> 06:36.450
Oh, fuck.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.960
<i>This was a scene I re-shot...</i>

06:39.040 --> 06:41.630
<i>three days after I shot it, which is rare.</i>

06:42.710 --> 06:45.130
<i>And it's rare to re-shoot something so fast...</i>

06:45.210 --> 06:47.380
<i>but it was a much longer scene and I felt...</i>

06:47.460 --> 06:51.090
<i>when I watched it back in dailies,</i>
<i>that Troy talked far too much in the scene...</i>

06:51.180 --> 06:52.550
<i>and that lost his mystery.</i>

06:52.640 --> 06:55.430
<i>And was also trying too hard</i>
<i>to be Swoff's friend.</i>

06:55.510 --> 06:58.270
Little fuck-fuck trick
we play on the new guys.

07:00.350 --> 07:01.520
Nice.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.980
You want a brand,
you gotta earn it.

07:05.570 --> 07:09.780
<i>I wanted their friendship to be unexpected</i>
<i>and for it to creep up on us.</i>

07:09.860 --> 07:13.410
<i>And I wanted him to remain</i>
<i>a mysterious and distant character.</i>

07:22.830 --> 07:24.960
<i>I originally had three scenes here...</i>

07:25.040 --> 07:28.380
<i>all showing how little Swoff suddenly</i>
<i>wanted to be in the Marine Corps...</i>

07:28.460 --> 07:30.510
<i>and how big a mistake he felt he'd made.</i>

07:30.590 --> 07:33.800
<i>And it all came down to this one scene</i>
<i>with the nurse, in the end.</i>

07:33.890 --> 07:35.300
...that stomach flu, Swofford?

07:35.390 --> 07:37.180
I <i>can't</i> seem to shake it.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.680
<i>That's</i> all right.
Not <i>everyone's</i> cut out for the Marines.

07:40.770 --> 07:44.310
But for me, there was nowhere else.
That was the truth.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.650
After all, I was made in a war.

07:47.820 --> 07:51.900
<i>And then we cut into these flashbacks</i>
<i>which are all shot on Super 16...</i>

07:51.990 --> 07:56.120
<i>just to give it the feel of a home movie,</i>
<i>of a series of recollections.</i>

07:56.200 --> 08:00.250
<i>Quite stylised, obviously,</i>
<i>but I wanted this kind of....</i>

08:00.660 --> 08:05.380
<i>This incredibly swift travelogue</i>
<i>through his past life.</i>

08:05.580 --> 08:09.590
<i>And I wanted to get the feeling of it</i>
<i>as a memory, without being that specific.</i>

08:09.670 --> 08:12.760
<i>And that's why we shot it on Super 16,</i>
<i>like a home movie.</i>

08:15.430 --> 08:17.680
<i>It was originally intended</i>
<i>for earlier in the film.</i>

08:17.760 --> 08:19.680
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>Walter Murch, the editor, and I...</i>

08:19.770 --> 08:24.560
<i>decided it would be better off</i>
<i>going in the toilet, kind of as a reverie...</i>

08:24.690 --> 08:28.860
<i>out of which he is woken up in a second</i>
<i>by Staff Sergeant Sykes...</i>

08:28.940 --> 08:31.570
<i>Jamie Foxx's character, who is his future.</i>

08:31.820 --> 08:34.030
<i>And everything that will happen</i>
<i>from now on...</i>

08:34.110 --> 08:36.120
<i>comes from this one conversation.</i>

08:36.200 --> 08:37.870
<i>And from now on his life will change...</i>

08:37.950 --> 08:40.120
<i>and he will have a focus, which is STA...</i>

08:40.200 --> 08:43.210
<i>and that's</i>
<i>the Surveillance and Target Acquisition.</i>

08:43.409 --> 08:47.460
<i>Which is this elite sniper platoon</i>
<i>that Jamie Foxx's character heads up.</i>

08:48.420 --> 08:50.710
What the fuck? You're sick?

08:52.420 --> 08:56.930
<i>And inside that flashback, you'll find a lot</i>
<i>of information about Swoff's life...</i>

08:57.470 --> 08:58.970
<i>that goes by very, very quickly...</i>

08:59.050 --> 09:01.770
<i>but that beds down, I hope,</i>
<i>quite quickly, too...</i>

09:01.810 --> 09:05.140
<i>about the fact, that frankly,</i>
<i>there was nowhere else for him to go.</i>

09:05.230 --> 09:08.020
<i>He didn't feel at home when he was at home.</i>

09:08.110 --> 09:11.110
<i>You can see the dog tags</i>
<i>around his father's neck at breakfast...</i>

09:11.190 --> 09:14.190
<i>you see the girlfriend he's leaving behind,</i>
<i>you see that he's given her...</i>

09:14.280 --> 09:16.990
<i>his most treasured possession,</i>
<i>which is his USMC T-shirt.</i>

09:17.030 --> 09:19.200
<i>And all of those things</i>
<i>are buried very quickly...</i>

09:19.280 --> 09:21.620
<i>as well as the fact that he's reading Camus...</i>

09:21.700 --> 09:25.500
<i>and that he wants to go to college,</i>
<i>or was thinking about going to college.</i>

09:25.580 --> 09:27.620
<i>A fact that's picked up here...</i>

09:27.790 --> 09:32.300
<i>when Sykes, Jamie's character,</i>
<i>picks up that copy of</i> The Stranger...

09:32.380 --> 09:35.670
<i>and treats it</i>
<i>as if it's some strange Sanskrit text...</i>

09:35.760 --> 09:39.220
<i>that only the chosen few can understand.</i>

09:39.300 --> 09:42.810
<i>Something that again,</i>
<i>as was the case often in this movie...</i>

09:43.220 --> 09:44.520
<i>was an improvisation.</i>

09:44.600 --> 09:47.440
<i>And something that, you know, came to us</i>
<i>because we had rehearsed a lot...</i>

09:47.520 --> 09:49.690
<i>and the actors were very confident</i>
<i>with each other...</i>

09:49.770 --> 09:51.520
<i>very certain</i>
<i>of what the structure of the scene was.</i>

09:51.610 --> 09:54.320
<i>So, like good jazz musicians,</i>
<i>they could improvise over the top...</i>

09:54.360 --> 09:57.990
<i>of what was a very simple,</i>
<i>but certain rhythm.</i>

09:59.280 --> 10:01.700
A little, for small holiday concerts
and festivals.

10:01.780 --> 10:03.080
Good. You <i>ain't</i> gotta be
Chuck Mangione.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.200
All I need is a bugler.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.290
Somebody to play taps,
reveille, battle <i>march....</i>

10:06.370 --> 10:10.830
<i>Jake's lines about a few "holiday concerts</i>
<i>and festivals", that's an improvisation.</i>

10:10.920 --> 10:12.590
<i>Jamie throwing the book in the bin...</i>

10:12.670 --> 10:14.550
<i>astonishingly, at the end,</i>
<i>is an improvisation.</i>

10:14.630 --> 10:16.090
Can I get my book?

10:18.680 --> 10:20.590
<i>There's</i> 60 of you.
I only need eight.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.510
<i>Here's a scene that we took from the book...</i>

10:22.600 --> 10:25.810
<i>and we adapted and enlarged.</i>

10:26.520 --> 10:30.230
<i>In the book the Staff Sergeant doesn't</i>
<i>make him play the bugle with his mouth...</i>

10:30.310 --> 10:32.190
<i>but says he could do, if he wanted...</i>

10:32.270 --> 10:35.360
<i>and he hasn't done it</i>
<i>to avoid him being humiliated.</i>

10:35.610 --> 10:37.820
<i>But, Bill Broyles,</i>
<i>the wonderful screenwriter...</i>

10:37.900 --> 10:40.240
<i>who is himself a Vietnam vet</i>
<i>and an ex-Marine...</i>

10:40.320 --> 10:43.990
<i>and I just thought it was too good</i>
<i>an opportunity for a great scene...</i>

10:44.080 --> 10:46.790
<i>to force him to play reveille with his mouth.</i>

10:49.370 --> 10:51.380
Okay, Swofford, play reveille.

10:52.380 --> 10:53.920
I <i>don't</i> have a bugle,
Staff Sergeant.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.050
-You <i>don't</i> have a what?
-I <i>don't</i> have a bugle.

10:56.130 --> 10:58.670
Oh, no. No, no. Damn, damn.

10:59.130 --> 11:01.220
You better play with your mouth.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.220
What?

11:04.300 --> 11:06.720
I said, play it
with your goddamn mouth.

11:17.280 --> 11:21.700
<i>And then we decided</i>
<i>that maybe he should play another classic.</i>

11:22.740 --> 11:25.200
<i>Which I think at one stage</i>
<i>was Earth, Wind and Fire...</i>

11:25.280 --> 11:29.080
<i>and then maybe was Don't</i> Worry Be Happy,
<i>and various other choices.</i>

11:29.200 --> 11:32.790
<i>And Jamie came down on the side of</i>
You Are The Sunshine Of My Life...

11:32.880 --> 11:37.880
<i>which seemed fantastic, and then Jake</i>
<i>again, took it that extra little bit further.</i>

11:38.260 --> 11:41.380
<i>But again, what Jamie says</i>
<i>here on the parade ground...</i>

11:41.470 --> 11:45.260
<i>"My morale is lifted. Do you know any</i>
<i>Stevie Wonder? Good, that's a classic. "</i>

11:45.350 --> 11:46.760
<i>All that stuff, that's improvised.</i>

11:46.850 --> 11:49.930
<i>Improvised on the day.</i>
<i>And often times I was in the...</i>

11:50.600 --> 11:54.060
<i>I suppose, the nice situation of only having</i>
<i>one option of a shot sometimes...</i>

11:54.150 --> 11:57.320
<i>because it was an improvisation</i>
<i>that never was repeated.</i>

11:57.400 --> 12:00.490
<i>And I was very concerned</i>
<i>with this movie, stylistically...</i>

12:00.570 --> 12:04.740
<i>to throw out everything I had used before</i>
<i>in</i> American Beauty <i>and</i> Road to Perdition...

12:04.820 --> 12:06.990
<i>and not pre-plan the film...</i>

12:07.080 --> 12:10.700
<i>not over-compose the shots,</i>
<i>not be painterly about it.</i>

12:11.080 --> 12:12.960
<i>But to be organic.</i>

12:13.040 --> 12:16.500
<i>To always be</i>
<i>in a biased, subjective viewpoint.</i>

12:16.590 --> 12:18.340
<i>There's no unbiased shot in this movie.</i>

12:18.420 --> 12:22.050
<i>There are very, very few God shots....</i>
<i>Or, there are no God shots, really.</i>

12:22.130 --> 12:25.300
<i>There are no opportunities</i>
<i>that afford the audience...</i>

12:25.390 --> 12:28.600
<i>a view that is unavailable</i>
<i>to the characters in the film.</i>

12:29.600 --> 12:33.060
<i>And to that end,</i>
<i>we used mostly hand-held camera...</i>

12:34.020 --> 12:36.650
<i>and Roger Deakins operating the</i>
<i>whole time, and he is a brilliant operator...</i>

12:36.730 --> 12:37.860
<i>which is very fortunate...</i>

12:37.940 --> 12:39.940
<i>and a brilliant cinematographer,</i>
<i>simultaneously...</i>

12:40.030 --> 12:42.030
<i>which is a rare thing, I think.</i>

12:43.110 --> 12:45.910
<i>We entered that scene entirely</i>
<i>through Swoff's point of view.</i>

12:45.990 --> 12:49.030
<i>And here we fell into this sequence</i>
<i>that was very long in the script...</i>

12:49.120 --> 12:53.160
<i>about their training, and there was a couple</i>
<i>of other scenes in here that I took out.</i>

12:53.250 --> 12:56.380
<i>But became,</i>
<i>once we got into the cutting room...</i>

12:56.460 --> 12:58.210
<i>almost one single montage.</i>

12:58.500 --> 13:03.050
<i>Accompanied by Tom Newman's fantastic</i>
<i>bit of music here in the background...</i>

13:03.260 --> 13:06.640
<i>which kind of binds and unifies</i>
<i>the sequence...</i>

13:06.720 --> 13:09.720
<i>as one long period of growth for Swoff.</i>

13:10.010 --> 13:14.140
<i>Who at the beginning is laughing</i>
<i>and thinking it's all stupid and just a joke...</i>

13:14.230 --> 13:19.440
<i>and by the end, is totally obsessed with the</i>
<i>idea of being a sniper and being the best.</i>

13:19.980 --> 13:22.400
<i>And here you have these guys</i>
<i>running cadence...</i>

13:22.480 --> 13:24.110
<i>which in itself tells a story...</i>

13:24.190 --> 13:28.280
<i>because the number of people is gradually</i>
<i>reducing as each lesson is taught.</i>

13:28.370 --> 13:30.780
<i>More people fall away, more people fail.</i>

13:30.870 --> 13:33.410
<i>One of the things I realised</i>
<i>talking to our Marine advisors...</i>

13:33.500 --> 13:36.120
<i>without whom it would have been</i>
<i>impossible to make this film...</i>

13:36.210 --> 13:39.540
<i>was the amount of detail...</i>

13:39.630 --> 13:42.710
<i>they have to retain mentally</i>
<i>in order to become a sniper.</i>

13:42.800 --> 13:45.300
<i>I mean, Tony,</i>
<i>when we were in pre-production...</i>

13:45.380 --> 13:49.640
<i>gave me a huge file full of paperwork</i>
<i>about snipers.</i>

13:49.720 --> 13:52.260
<i>And one of the things</i>
<i>that I think is in the movie...</i>

13:52.350 --> 13:56.100
<i>when Swoff turns on Fergus,</i>
<i>later on in the film...</i>

13:56.190 --> 13:59.650
<i>is that his mind is filled</i>
<i>with the technical details and information...</i>

13:59.730 --> 14:02.860
<i>about firing a rifle,</i>
<i>and what that rifle does and is.</i>

14:03.110 --> 14:04.360
...shit!

14:04.440 --> 14:06.240
Now, consider your target.

14:06.860 --> 14:08.610
<i>And here he is...</i>

14:08.700 --> 14:12.160
<i>in the process of sexualising his rifle...</i>

14:12.620 --> 14:17.290
<i>making it part of him, and beginning</i>
<i>to understand and catch the bug.</i>

14:17.370 --> 14:19.000
<i>It was very interesting,</i>
<i>when we went to boot camp....</i>

14:19.080 --> 14:23.000
<i>Because, as you'll see from some</i>
<i>of the documentaries on this DVD...</i>

14:23.300 --> 14:25.010
<i>the actors went to boot camp...</i>

14:25.090 --> 14:28.300
<i>and one of the things that they consistently</i>
<i>said is their most exciting moment...</i>

14:28.380 --> 14:31.300
<i>and the high point,</i>
<i>was the firing of the weapons.</i>

14:31.470 --> 14:35.890
<i>Now, whatever you do, you put a gun</i>
<i>in someone's hand and you shoot it...</i>

14:36.100 --> 14:37.480
<i>something happens to them.</i>

14:37.560 --> 14:39.400
If you pick your head up,
you will get fucked up!

14:39.480 --> 14:40.730
<i>Let's</i> find out if we <i>have....</i>

14:40.810 --> 14:42.860
<i>Here we are</i>
<i>in this live-fire training sequence.</i>

14:42.940 --> 14:44.480
<i>There's an interesting story</i>
<i>attached to this scene...</i>

14:44.570 --> 14:47.190
<i>which is that</i>
<i>this is absolutely not in Tony's book...</i>

14:47.280 --> 14:49.360
<i>and only arrived</i>
<i>in a very late draft of the script...</i>

14:49.450 --> 14:52.200
<i>because I felt the need</i>
<i>for something very much darker...</i>

14:52.280 --> 14:56.040
<i>to kind of remind us</i>
<i>that this wasn't a game...</i>

14:56.120 --> 14:58.830
<i>and that these guys were in jeopardy</i>
<i>the whole time...</i>

14:58.870 --> 15:00.580
<i>and they were dealing with stuff</i>
<i>that's frightening.</i>

15:00.670 --> 15:02.250
<i>I mean, really viscerally frightening.</i>

15:02.330 --> 15:05.590
<i>And when you're in the rain</i>
<i>and grubbing through the mud...</i>

15:05.670 --> 15:09.840
<i>with just fake bullets</i>
<i>flying over your head, as it were...</i>

15:10.380 --> 15:13.180
<i>it's pretty scary.</i>
<i>And these guys went through the real thing.</i>

15:13.850 --> 15:14.930
Cease-fire!

15:15.010 --> 15:19.180
<i>The order of lines</i>
<i>at the end of the scene here was reversed...</i>

15:19.270 --> 15:21.230
<i>by Walter Murch in a stroke of genius.</i>

15:21.310 --> 15:22.350
Shit!

15:23.690 --> 15:26.440
<i>The first line, "Shit",</i>
<i>and then the second line, "Shit"...</i>

15:26.530 --> 15:27.860
<i>both were at the end of the scene.</i>

15:27.940 --> 15:31.490
<i>In the original scene he came right over</i>
<i>and started shouting.</i>

15:32.200 --> 15:34.070
I told you to keep
your fucking head down!

15:34.160 --> 15:35.240
If you listened to me...

15:35.330 --> 15:37.200
you would still be
fucking alive right now!

15:37.290 --> 15:38.330
Stupid fuck!

15:38.410 --> 15:39.750
<i>And this is so much better...</i>

15:39.830 --> 15:44.250
<i>and one of the examples</i>
<i>of Walter's particular genius.</i>

15:45.420 --> 15:49.210
<i>This live-fire scene was one of the scenes</i>
<i>based on a story...</i>

15:49.550 --> 15:52.180
<i>told to us by a Marine that we met</i>
<i>during researching the movie.</i>

15:52.260 --> 15:55.260
<i>This happened to his friend,</i>
<i>who was crawling in front of him...</i>

15:55.350 --> 15:58.680
<i>during this exercise,</i>
<i>that he watched him be shot.</i>

15:58.770 --> 16:00.850
<i>And that his Staff Sergeant...</i>

16:00.930 --> 16:04.270
<i>walked over and started shouting at him</i>
<i>for not listening.</i>

16:04.650 --> 16:07.730
<i>And here is the end of the training</i>
<i>which is the presentation of the rifles.</i>

16:07.820 --> 16:09.940
<i>I wanted this scene to have</i>
<i>almost a religious feeling...</i>

16:10.030 --> 16:12.450
<i>and, to that end, you'll hear on the score...</i>

16:12.530 --> 16:16.490
<i>the very beginnings, as you see the rifle,</i>
<i>of a piece of music...</i>

16:16.580 --> 16:18.620
<i>that Tom composed...</i>

16:18.700 --> 16:20.790
<i>that has a slightly religious air to it.</i>

16:20.870 --> 16:23.710
<i>There's something suspended</i>
<i>and breathless about it.</i>

16:23.790 --> 16:25.540
...you will repeat after me.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.880
-This is my rifle.
-This is my rifle.

16:30.260 --> 16:35.430
<i>This little particular piece</i>
<i>of back-forth with Staff Sergeant Sykes...</i>

16:35.800 --> 16:39.680
<i>is echoed much later</i>
<i>when Swoff turns the gun on Fergus.</i>

16:39.770 --> 16:41.680
<i>"This is my rifle", etc.</i>

16:42.140 --> 16:45.440
<i>And I thought it was very important</i>
<i>to lay that in early.</i>

16:46.310 --> 16:51.150
<i>And just this shot,</i>
<i>of Swoff staring at his rifle...</i>

16:51.900 --> 16:53.990
<i>and becoming one with it for the first time...</i>

16:54.070 --> 16:56.780
<i>and focussing on what he needs to do...</i>

16:56.870 --> 16:58.780
<i>and now he's a soldier</i>
<i>and he knows what he wants...</i>

16:58.870 --> 17:01.250
<i>which is to use the rifle and to kill...</i>

17:01.410 --> 17:05.369
<i>is very important for the whole movie</i>
<i>because he's now pointing forward.</i>

17:05.460 --> 17:06.960
<i>He has a purpose.</i>

17:07.290 --> 17:09.460
<i>And the more purposed</i>
<i>and the more focussed he was...</i>

17:09.550 --> 17:13.589
<i>when he arrived in the desert,</i>
<i>the more making him wait...</i>

17:13.670 --> 17:16.640
<i>would turn him, on some level, insane.</i>

17:17.970 --> 17:22.349
<i>And I thought that was very important</i>
<i>that he was fully engaged at this point.</i>

17:23.730 --> 17:26.849
<i>One of the scenes I took out</i>
<i>was a fascinating piece of detail...</i>

17:26.940 --> 17:30.940
<i>which is that you need to be able to shoot</i>
<i>what they call a "dime group at a grand".</i>

17:31.030 --> 17:35.200
<i>In other words, a group of bullets</i>
<i>that would fit within a dime at 1,000 yards.</i>

17:35.740 --> 17:38.160
<i>And 1,000 yards, for those of you</i>
<i>who don't know, is a long way...</i>

17:38.240 --> 17:39.490
<i>when you see it in real life.</i>

17:39.580 --> 17:42.290
<i>And that firing range</i>
<i>that we just shot on was 300 yards.</i>

17:42.370 --> 17:45.080
...worldwide protests
and drew sanctions...

17:45.160 --> 17:47.880
from the United States,
Great Britain and the Soviet Union.

17:47.960 --> 17:50.420
The government
of dictator Saddam Hussein...

17:51.550 --> 17:52.840
<i>And here they are.</i>

17:52.920 --> 17:56.010
<i>We trawled through hours</i>
<i>of news footage to try and get this...</i>

17:56.090 --> 17:58.050
<i>rather moving piece</i>
<i>of the Kuwaiti ambassador...</i>

17:58.140 --> 17:59.350
<i>saying that "We need help. "</i>

17:59.430 --> 18:02.890
<i>And I wanted it to be Troy</i>
<i>that could interpret that...</i>

18:02.970 --> 18:05.350
<i>basically as we're off to war.</i>

18:13.110 --> 18:15.280
We're going to fucking war.

18:18.860 --> 18:22.530
<i>And then we go to one of the scenes that</i>
<i>I suppose first attracted me to the book...</i>

18:22.620 --> 18:24.500
<i>and in the script...</i>

18:24.700 --> 18:28.420
<i>which is this amazing scene</i>
<i>in which they're watching, which is...</i>

18:29.460 --> 18:30.630
<i>by common consent...</i>

18:30.710 --> 18:33.880
<i>one of the greatest anti-war movies</i>
<i>of all time,</i> Apocalypse Now...

18:33.960 --> 18:38.510
<i>and they're treating it entirely</i>
<i>as a pro-war movie and getting pumped up.</i>

18:38.590 --> 18:41.100
<i>There's some very powerful sections</i>
<i>in the book...</i>

18:41.180 --> 18:44.220
<i>about how all anti-war movies</i>
<i>are basically pro-war movies...</i>

18:44.310 --> 18:46.230
<i>when you play them to Marines.</i>

18:49.940 --> 18:53.860
<i>But I thought it was very ironic</i>
<i>that it should be this great movie...</i>

18:53.940 --> 18:56.780
<i>and I'm very, very grateful</i>
<i>to Francis Coppola...</i>

18:56.860 --> 18:58.400
<i>that he allowed us to use it.</i>

18:58.490 --> 19:01.660
<i>Because there's two ways</i>
<i>in which you could take it, and I hope...</i>

19:01.740 --> 19:05.580
<i>it's taken in the right way.</i>
<i>That it's obviously not a pro-war movie.</i>

19:07.080 --> 19:10.920
<i>Some people have said</i>
<i>that they feel this movie is apolitical...</i>

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
<i>which is not something</i>
<i>I would ever agree with.</i>

19:14.460 --> 19:18.630
<i>In the current environment,</i>
<i>just the very fact of making the film...</i>

19:18.720 --> 19:23.010
<i>in my opinion, makes it political.</i>
<i>What it isn't, of course, is party-political.</i>

19:23.100 --> 19:26.930
<i>It doesn't have a polemic,</i>
<i>although I was very tempted...</i>

19:27.020 --> 19:30.390
<i>at many times during the making of this film</i>
<i>in post-production...</i>

19:30.810 --> 19:35.020
<i>to give my opinion of what's</i>
<i>currently happening in Iraq as I speak.</i>

19:35.650 --> 19:37.820
<i>It didn't seem to be true</i>
<i>to the source material...</i>

19:37.900 --> 19:40.900
<i>or to the men</i>
<i>who lived through the war in 1991.</i>

19:41.410 --> 19:44.580
<i>But there are many things in the film</i>
<i>that you see that are still the case...</i>

19:44.660 --> 19:46.660
<i>and this scene, of course, is one of them.</i>

19:46.830 --> 19:49.750
Now hear this. Now hear this.

19:49.830 --> 19:51.870
All personnel from 2-7...

19:51.960 --> 19:55.090
are to report immediately
to your company area.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.380
Get some, Marines. Get some!

19:58.460 --> 20:00.550
<i>This transition, which I think</i>
<i>is one of my favourite...</i>

20:00.630 --> 20:05.850
<i>from the men screaming at a fake war</i>
<i>to travelling in total silence to a real war...</i>

20:06.060 --> 20:09.100
<i>as they did, many of them,</i>
<i>in domestic jetliners...</i>

20:09.180 --> 20:11.770
<i>with stewardesses serving them nuts.</i>

20:14.440 --> 20:17.400
<i>Here this is an improvisation on the day</i>
<i>that we came up with...</i>

20:17.480 --> 20:20.190
<i>because originally he was just commenting</i>
<i>on the air stewardess...</i>

20:20.240 --> 20:24.280
<i>as she was standing and demonstrating</i>
<i>things down the end of the aisle.</i>

20:24.530 --> 20:28.330
<i>And I wanted to use Kristin,</i>
<i>who's a very, very good actress.</i>

20:28.990 --> 20:31.120
<i>I wanted to make sure</i>
<i>she had the last word...</i>

20:31.210 --> 20:33.370
<i>'cause the women in the movie</i>
<i>are pretty few and far between...</i>

20:33.460 --> 20:35.040
<i>and I wanted to make sure that all of them...</i>

20:35.130 --> 20:37.500
<i>at the end of the day,</i>
<i>had some kind of justification.</i>

20:38.710 --> 20:41.920
You know,
I <i>don't</i> really like the little ones.

20:42.590 --> 20:44.680
-Okay, is that all?
-Yeah.

20:44.930 --> 20:46.140
Would you like some nuts?

20:46.260 --> 20:48.180
<i>But all the stuff about the nuts</i>
<i>is improvised...</i>

20:48.260 --> 20:52.230
<i>and this is the introduction of Kruger,</i>
<i>who is Lucas Black's character.</i>

20:52.310 --> 20:55.190
Cocksucker knew the price of every
whore from Olangapo to Stockholm.

20:56.150 --> 20:58.190
<i>And one of the things I loved about</i>
<i>Lucas's character...</i>

20:58.270 --> 21:00.610
<i>as I love about all the characters,</i>
<i>is they're very unexpected.</i>

21:00.690 --> 21:04.200
<i>The clichÃ© of the southern hick</i>
<i>is that he's stupid...</i>

21:04.280 --> 21:06.320
<i>and here was the guy</i>
<i>who was the most intelligent...</i>

21:06.410 --> 21:08.740
<i>and probably the most perceptive,</i>
<i>and certainly the most in touch...</i>

21:08.830 --> 21:12.330
<i>with what's going on in the actual war</i>
<i>of any of them.</i>

21:12.410 --> 21:14.160
<i>But he's roguish, too.</i>

21:14.250 --> 21:16.040
You just start all over again.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.040
How long you think we'll be there?
Two weeks?

21:19.170 --> 21:21.670
Less, man. We'll be back so fast...

21:21.760 --> 21:23.510
we'll still be
shitting out those nuts.

21:24.090 --> 21:26.720
Good luck, now. Goodbye, now.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.470
<i>Here's another improvised line on the steps.</i>

21:29.680 --> 21:31.600
Want to keep me company
for two weeks?

21:31.680 --> 21:32.770
Goodbye, now.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.980
-You <i>don't</i> know what you're missing.
-Yeah, yeah.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.520
<i>And then we come down onto the tarmac</i>
<i>and everything you see here...</i>

21:38.610 --> 21:41.440
<i>was pretty much as we shot it,</i>
<i>except background removal.</i>

21:41.530 --> 21:44.740
<i>And also ILM, who did an astonishing job</i>
<i>on the effects in this movie...</i>

21:44.820 --> 21:47.160
<i>and I can't speak highly enough</i>
<i>about Pablo Helman...</i>

21:47.240 --> 21:49.160
<i>who's the visual effects supervisor.</i>

21:49.240 --> 21:53.700
<i>Changed all the insignias on the planes</i>
<i>so they were TWA planes.</i>

21:55.290 --> 21:58.540
<i>But here they are arriving for the first time</i>
<i>in this burning heat...</i>

21:58.630 --> 22:01.210
<i>and this was the first chance</i>
<i>that Roger Deakins and I...</i>

22:01.300 --> 22:04.510
<i>had to overexpose the film</i>
<i>and really blow it...</i>

22:04.590 --> 22:09.050
<i>and make it feel like it was this hot,</i>
<i>almost white...</i>

22:10.300 --> 22:13.060
<i>sort of science-fiction landscape, in a way...</i>

22:13.140 --> 22:16.020
<i>that gradually during the course</i>
<i>of the second act of the movie...</i>

22:16.100 --> 22:20.400
<i>which starts, I suppose, around here</i>
<i>and ends when they go into Kuwait...</i>

22:20.480 --> 22:22.020
<i>becomes more and more blown...</i>

22:22.110 --> 22:25.530
<i>more and more overexposed</i>
<i>until nothing is available to you.</i>

22:26.240 --> 22:28.950
<i>No horizon line, nothing, no detail.</i>

22:30.030 --> 22:33.120
<i>And they're cut adrift in this moonscape</i>
<i>which is the desert.</i>

22:36.330 --> 22:37.460
<i>And here's Chris Cooper.</i>

22:37.540 --> 22:40.630
<i>This is the second time Chris Cooper</i>
<i>has played a Marine colonel for me.</i>

22:40.710 --> 22:42.540
<i>He played a Marine colonel</i>
<i>in</i> American Beauty.

22:42.750 --> 22:45.090
<i>And he was equally brilliant then.</i>
<i>He's an amazing actor.</i>

22:45.170 --> 22:48.050
<i>And I just love to have him</i>
<i>in everything I do, really.</i>

22:48.130 --> 22:50.220
<i>And I was very lucky to get him</i>
<i>for two scenes here...</i>

22:50.300 --> 22:53.010
<i>'cause just the authority and the status...</i>

22:53.390 --> 22:56.140
<i>and everything he brings with him</i>
<i>is so extraordinary.</i>

22:56.230 --> 22:59.100
We are now a part of
Operation Desert Shield.

22:59.850 --> 23:01.150
Now, just north of us...

23:01.400 --> 23:04.570
Saddam <i>Hussein's</i> got one million
Iraqi soldiers.

23:05.780 --> 23:07.610
And some of those boys
have been fighting...

23:07.700 --> 23:10.110
since you were nine
or ten years old.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.620
They are tough.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.830
They will stop at nothing.

23:14.240 --> 23:18.040
They've used nerve gas
against the Iranians and the Kurds.

23:18.620 --> 23:21.880
<i>There's something of the showman</i>
<i>about Kazinski in this scene...</i>

23:21.960 --> 23:23.710
<i>pumping them up for war.</i>

23:23.790 --> 23:28.420
<i>This is, I'm sorry to say, a real photograph</i>
<i>of a victim of a chemical attack.</i>

23:29.050 --> 23:31.640
You're thinking,
<i>"Let's</i> kick ass and take <i>names...."</i>

23:31.970 --> 23:35.390
<i>It's funny, isn't it,</i>
<i>the thin line between fact and fiction...</i>

23:35.470 --> 23:39.270
<i>and sometimes you feel it's not acceptable</i>
<i>to use real photos of people...</i>

23:39.350 --> 23:40.940
<i>in what is basically a movie.</i>

23:41.020 --> 23:43.650
<i>But when fact and fiction</i>
<i>are interlinked so closely...</i>

23:43.730 --> 23:45.650
<i>I think it's probably acceptable.</i>

23:50.400 --> 23:53.870
<i>On this day, as we landed and we walked off</i>
<i>these fake planes...</i>

23:53.950 --> 23:56.330
<i>or these broken old planes,</i>
<i>onto this tarmac...</i>

23:56.410 --> 24:00.750
<i>way down the end of the runway</i>
<i>there was a plane loading up...</i>

24:00.960 --> 24:05.750
<i>real troops going to Iraq.</i>
<i>And that was a very sobering experience.</i>

24:06.340 --> 24:08.420
<i>You can have nothing but respect.</i>

24:08.510 --> 24:11.220
<i>Particularly once you've lived with</i>
<i>and talked to Marines...</i>

24:11.300 --> 24:12.680
<i>to the degree that we did.</i>

24:12.760 --> 24:14.760
<i>Nothing but respect</i>
<i>for what they've gone through...</i>

24:14.850 --> 24:17.060
<i>and what they continue to go through</i>
<i>in the Middle East.</i>

24:17.140 --> 24:18.930
...and one day soon...

24:19.020 --> 24:22.310
Saddam Hussein is gonna regret
pulling this sorry shit.

24:22.390 --> 24:23.690
Ooh-rah!

24:23.850 --> 24:25.610
We're gonna kick some Iraqi ass!

24:25.690 --> 24:29.940
<i>And here's Evan Jones who I think</i>
<i>is just also a bit of a genius.</i>

24:30.030 --> 24:32.360
<i>His first appearance, Fowler.</i>

24:32.740 --> 24:34.410
<i>Standing up and doing something crazy...</i>

24:34.490 --> 24:37.660
<i>which is what he continues to do</i>
<i>most of the time, the rest of the movie.</i>

24:37.740 --> 24:40.910
<i>And they find him funny to begin with,</i>
<i>which I think is very important...</i>

24:41.000 --> 24:44.330
<i>and increasingly</i>
<i>he sort of becomes unhinged.</i>

24:44.580 --> 24:47.590
Oh, boys, I just got a hard-on!

24:53.220 --> 24:56.930
<i>Here's a shot I particularly liked</i>
<i>that we took driving out of the mirage.</i>

24:57.010 --> 25:00.980
<i>When we went to the big, wide open,</i>
<i>empty desert that you see here....</i>

25:01.060 --> 25:02.180
<i>This is Mexico.</i>

25:02.270 --> 25:04.810
<i>We shot most of this movie in</i>
<i>El Centro, California...</i>

25:04.900 --> 25:09.480
<i>where we built the camp, which is a pretty,</i>
<i>you know, average kind of place, really.</i>

25:09.570 --> 25:12.700
<i>It wasn't wildly interesting,</i>
<i>but it certainly did its job.</i>

25:13.610 --> 25:16.780
<i>And then we shot various,</i>
<i>different kinds of desert in different places.</i>

25:16.870 --> 25:20.120
<i>We went, for the big dunes at the end,</i>
<i>we went to Yuma in Arizona.</i>

25:20.200 --> 25:22.910
<i>And here we're in Mexico,</i>
<i>where we lived for two weeks.</i>

25:23.000 --> 25:25.920
<i>This location really is</i>
<i>the middle of nowhere.</i>

25:26.000 --> 25:29.170
<i>Seventy-five minutes from the nearest....</i>
<i>Basically from the nearest house.</i>

25:29.250 --> 25:33.630
<i>And we all went a little bit insane there</i>
<i>as people will do in the desert.</i>

25:34.090 --> 25:35.220
<i>He's</i> full of shit.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.010
Who do you think gave Saddam
all his fucking weapons?

25:39.050 --> 25:41.100
-We did!
-Fuck politics.

25:41.310 --> 25:43.180
<i>This scene in the Humvee</i>
<i>was a much longer scene.</i>

25:43.270 --> 25:45.730
<i>That line, that is now</i>
<i>the last line of the scene...</i>

25:45.810 --> 25:47.600
<i>that was actually</i>
<i>in the middle of the scene.</i>

25:47.690 --> 25:50.610
<i>And we made it the last line,</i>
<i>which I thought was much, much better.</i>

25:50.690 --> 25:53.400
<i>And that was, again,</i>
<i>something that we created in post.</i>

25:55.950 --> 25:59.830
<i>When I did this movie, I rehearsed for</i>
<i>four weeks, which is a long time for a film.</i>

25:59.910 --> 26:04.960
<i>And this scene I particularly focused on,</i>
<i>and we spent three days on this scene.</i>

26:05.370 --> 26:08.790
<i>We kind of gently rewrote it</i>
<i>with Bill Broyles as we went along.</i>

26:08.880 --> 26:10.380
<i>But not a great deal.</i>

26:10.460 --> 26:13.710
<i>When Jacob Vargas first saw the movie,</i>
<i>he's the actor playing Cortez, he said...</i>

26:13.800 --> 26:15.300
<i>"Man, that scene's great, you know...</i>

26:15.380 --> 26:19.140
<i>"we rehearsed it for three days and it looked</i>
<i>like we hadn't rehearsed at all. "</i>

26:19.350 --> 26:23.180
<i>Which I took as a compliment, you know.</i>
<i>What I think he was trying to say was...</i>

26:23.270 --> 26:26.770
<i>it looked totally natural and it looked like</i>
<i>it was being invented on the spot.</i>

26:26.850 --> 26:29.560
<i>And I think that's one of the great</i>
<i>misunderstandings about rehearsal...</i>

26:29.610 --> 26:31.820
<i>is that by rehearsing you set it...</i>

26:31.900 --> 26:34.820
<i>or make it stiff or make it pre-planned.</i>

26:34.900 --> 26:37.360
<i>For me rehearsals are about</i>
<i>filling up the gas tanks...</i>

26:37.450 --> 26:39.530
<i>of all the actors</i>
<i>with as much fuel as possible...</i>

26:39.620 --> 26:41.580
<i>but not turning on the engine.</i>

26:41.660 --> 26:43.910
<i>So that when they go,</i>
<i>they've got a hundred ideas...</i>

26:43.990 --> 26:47.370
<i>they've got things they wanna cram in</i>
<i>and there's invention all over the place.</i>

26:47.460 --> 26:48.960
<i>And that's what you see here, I mean...</i>

26:49.040 --> 26:52.460
<i>pretty much everything that's being said,</i>
<i>other than what Cortez is saying...</i>

26:52.540 --> 26:54.550
<i>is just improvised on the day.</i>

26:54.630 --> 26:55.960
<i>A lot of the time I told the actors...</i>

26:56.050 --> 26:59.260
<i>they didn't have to match from take to take</i>
<i>what they were doing...</i>

26:59.340 --> 27:01.680
<i>'cause I felt</i>
<i>that would stop them inventing...</i>

27:01.760 --> 27:05.430
<i>and make them feel like they were limited.</i>
<i>And I didn't want that to be the case.</i>

27:06.310 --> 27:09.850
<i>As a consequence, you know, you do get a
great sense that they're giving themselves...</i>

27:09.940 --> 27:12.650
<i>to the roles and, that somehow,</i>
<i>there are definite crossovers...</i>

27:12.730 --> 27:16.360
<i>between the people acting the roles</i>
<i>and the roles that they are playing.</i>

27:17.530 --> 27:20.450
<i>A good example of that, in fact,</i>
<i>is the relationship between...</i>

27:20.530 --> 27:23.530
<i>Jake Gyllenhaal and Peter Sarsgaard,</i>
<i>who plays Troy...</i>

27:23.620 --> 27:25.370
<i>and both of whom are, I think, fantastic.</i>

27:25.450 --> 27:29.290
<i>But both of whom know each other very well</i>
<i>in real life because Peter...</i>

27:29.370 --> 27:31.500
<i>at the time we were doing this movie,</i>
<i>and now as I speak...</i>

27:31.580 --> 27:34.170
<i>is with Jake's sister, Maggie Gyllenhaal...</i>

27:34.250 --> 27:36.300
<i>and they've known each other</i>
<i>for two or three years.</i>

27:36.380 --> 27:39.090
<i>And so, in a sense,</i>
<i>he's kind of his brother-in-law.</i>

27:39.130 --> 27:41.510
<i>And that closeness</i>
<i>and also that love-hate relationship...</i>

27:41.590 --> 27:44.430
<i>was very useful in making this film,</i>
<i>because it's there on screen.</i>

27:44.510 --> 27:46.970
<i>You know, some of the competition,</i>
<i>some of the boredom...</i>

27:47.060 --> 27:50.600
<i>some of the envy,</i>
<i>some of the frustration is present.</i>

27:50.810 --> 27:55.110
<i>And it was my job to kind of make sure</i>
<i>it didn't spill over too much...</i>

27:55.190 --> 27:57.820
<i>but that it was allowed to be on camera</i>
<i>when it was needed.</i>

27:57.900 --> 28:00.530
...you're not too <i>busy....</i>
Gas! Gas! Gas!

28:00.610 --> 28:03.030
Right now! <i>I'm</i> talking about gas!
<i>Let's</i> go! <i>Let's</i> move it!

28:03.120 --> 28:04.530
Come on, guys,
what the fuck are you doing?

28:04.620 --> 28:06.290
<i>Let's</i> go! Get it on!

28:06.370 --> 28:07.790
Right now your dicks
are falling off!

28:07.870 --> 28:10.080
Your skin is bubble wrap!
<i>Let's</i> go! Move it!

28:10.160 --> 28:14.080
<i>This entire sequence, again,</i>
<i>everything that Jamie says is improvised.</i>

28:14.170 --> 28:16.630
<i>But we improvised it in rehearsal</i>
<i>and, you know, he said....</i>

28:16.710 --> 28:20.130
<i>He might have said some of these things,</i>
<i>but he just came in knowing he had to...</i>

28:20.220 --> 28:22.180
<i>give them a hard time.</i>

28:23.840 --> 28:25.640
You stay ready,
you <i>ain't</i> got to get ready!

28:26.350 --> 28:28.970
<i>Jamie did an amazing job on this film,</i>
<i>and he had a difficult task.</i>

28:29.060 --> 28:31.770
<i>A more difficult task, I think,</i>
<i>than some of the other Marines...</i>

28:31.810 --> 28:34.980
<i>in that he couldn't descend</i>
<i>into the group mentality...</i>

28:35.060 --> 28:38.360
<i>and turn to the person on his right</i>
<i>and say, "Well, what are we doing here?"...</i>

28:38.440 --> 28:41.320
<i>because he was on his own</i>
<i>giving the orders.</i>

28:41.400 --> 28:43.660
<i>Which, in many ways,</i>
<i>is more difficult than taking them.</i>

28:43.740 --> 28:45.740
<i>And he did it amazingly.</i>

28:45.820 --> 28:48.160
<i>Given the fact he was about to win</i>
<i>an Academy Award for</i> Ray...

28:48.240 --> 28:50.330
<i>and that's all anyone could talk about.</i>

28:50.410 --> 28:52.790
<i>He remained incredibly focused</i>
<i>during the making of the film...</i>

28:52.870 --> 28:55.790
<i>and was always five minutes early</i>
<i>and over-prepared.</i>

28:55.880 --> 28:57.540
<i>And I'll always be grateful to him for that...</i>

28:57.630 --> 29:00.260
<i>'cause he really showed the way</i>
<i>for lot of the young guys.</i>

29:00.340 --> 29:01.510
<i>Let's</i> go!

29:09.850 --> 29:11.180
Swofford, if you <i>don't</i> pick it up...

29:11.270 --> 29:13.890
<i>I'm</i> gonna shoot you
in your fucking foot! Move it!

29:14.270 --> 29:16.900
The price of crude oil
has nearly doubled.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.400
President Bush sends in more troops.

29:19.940 --> 29:23.110
<i>And here's a sequence that I always</i>
<i>thought of, when I was shooting it...</i>

29:23.200 --> 29:28.120
<i>as a much more kind of poetic,</i>
<i>almost languid sequence...</i>

29:28.200 --> 29:31.580
<i>which is one of the reasons</i>
<i>why it is shot in this sort of very fluid...</i>

29:31.660 --> 29:33.370
<i>quite, sort of relaxed way.</i>

29:33.460 --> 29:35.960
<i>But then when I watched it in the cut...</i>

29:36.040 --> 29:40.300
<i>I felt like the energy</i>
<i>of the gas mask sequence...</i>

29:40.380 --> 29:42.970
<i>should be poured into this whole sequence</i>
<i>in the desert...</i>

29:43.050 --> 29:45.550
<i>as they try to give themselves the feeling...</i>

29:45.880 --> 29:48.470
<i>that what they're doing</i>
<i>has some kind of purpose...</i>

29:48.550 --> 29:51.140
<i>but with, increasingly,</i>
<i>the sense that it doesn't.</i>

29:52.770 --> 29:55.890
<i>And that everything that they've been doing</i>
<i>is coming to nothing...</i>

29:55.980 --> 29:59.400
<i>and that they're losing the reason</i>
<i>why they're there...</i>

29:59.480 --> 30:02.780
<i>and it's becoming</i>
<i>a series of meaningless exercises.</i>

30:04.400 --> 30:07.700
<i>Which is what we feel when we watch them</i>
<i>hydrate over and over again.</i>

30:07.780 --> 30:09.240
And we hydrate some more.

30:09.330 --> 30:11.450
You will hydrate till I get full.

30:11.830 --> 30:13.790
There you go. Hold it down.

30:14.410 --> 30:15.830
Now, hold them up.

30:24.630 --> 30:26.840
<i>Here's this shot sitting on the berm.</i>
<i>This was in El Centro...</i>

30:26.930 --> 30:30.140
<i>and there was just an amazing sky</i>
<i>one night and it was, "Quick, quick!</i>

30:30.220 --> 30:32.850
<i>"Run up the top of the berm and let's grab</i>
<i>this shot from this sequence. "</i>

30:32.930 --> 30:35.310
<i>'Cause it was scheduled</i>
<i>to go somewhere completely different.</i>

30:36.940 --> 30:38.900
<i>This was a much longer scene.</i>

30:38.980 --> 30:42.360
<i>We've taken just the section</i>
<i>where Fowler enters with the scorpion.</i>

30:42.480 --> 30:44.190
<i>And one of the things that fascinated me...</i>

30:44.280 --> 30:49.410
<i>about the notion of the film before I started</i>
<i>it and when I first read the book was....</i>

30:49.490 --> 30:53.410
<i>"Well, what happens to a group of men</i>
<i>when you train them to go to war...</i>

30:53.490 --> 30:55.370
<i>"and then you take away the war?</i>

30:55.450 --> 30:58.420
<i>"How do they create their own war,</i>
<i>their own battles?</i>

30:58.500 --> 31:00.750
<i>"What do they put in its stead?"</i>

31:01.090 --> 31:03.380
<i>Now, astonishingly,</i>
<i>these scorpions that you see...</i>

31:03.460 --> 31:06.420
<i>are, in fact, computer-generated creatures...</i>

31:06.510 --> 31:09.220
<i>made entirely by ILM.</i>

31:09.340 --> 31:13.010
<i>I suppose, scorpions are the ideal</i>
<i>computer-generated creatures...</i>

31:13.100 --> 31:16.270
<i>because they're modular,</i>
<i>and they don't have hair.</i>

31:16.560 --> 31:18.850
<i>So, they're little tiny sections of things.</i>

31:18.940 --> 31:22.360
<i>But I defy anyone</i>
<i>to spot that they are not real.</i>

31:22.440 --> 31:24.980
<i>When they first showed it to me,</i>
<i>I just laughed. I couldn't believe it.</i>

31:25.070 --> 31:26.570
<i>I thought that they were lying to me...</i>

31:26.650 --> 31:28.450
<i>and that they'd just gone out</i>
<i>and shot real scorpions.</i>

31:30.200 --> 31:32.490
Go, Chango!

31:33.660 --> 31:37.040
<i>This, as it's picked up is,</i>
<i>in fact, a real scorpion...</i>

31:37.120 --> 31:39.160
<i>that Laz Alonso picked up.</i>

31:39.250 --> 31:41.830
<i>And there it is crawling back into the box.</i>
<i>That's real.</i>

31:42.380 --> 31:45.500
<i>And I know that Laz would want me</i>
<i>to say this on the commentary...</i>

31:45.590 --> 31:48.880
<i>because he's very proud</i>
<i>he picked up a live scorpion.</i>

31:48.970 --> 31:52.640
<i>The only thing that he won't want me to say</i>
<i>is it took him about three hours to do it...</i>

31:52.720 --> 31:55.140
<i>while everybody watched.</i>

31:55.470 --> 31:59.980
<i>And here's Evan Jones</i>
<i>just giving his scorpion a really hard time.</i>

32:00.060 --> 32:01.310
<i>It's one of my favourite lines in the film.</i>

32:01.400 --> 32:03.860
<i>But it's also just the beginning of a sense...</i>

32:05.150 --> 32:07.860
<i>that Fowler is dancing</i>
<i>to the beat of another drummer entirely.</i>

32:08.610 --> 32:09.860
<i>Here's a second-unit shot.</i>

32:09.950 --> 32:12.160
<i>They went out in the desert</i>
<i>and did this time-lapse photography...</i>

32:12.240 --> 32:13.450
<i>of the sun coming up</i>
<i>and the sun coming down.</i>

32:14.870 --> 32:17.370
<i>And if you look carefully, in fact,</i>
<i>you see a sunspot on the sun here.</i>

32:18.790 --> 32:21.830
<i>And it's just this mesmerising shot</i>
<i>of the sun rising.</i>

32:24.340 --> 32:27.300
<i>And here's another second-unit</i>
<i>series of shots...</i>

32:27.380 --> 32:30.420
<i>based, in large part,</i>
<i>on documentary shots...</i>

32:30.510 --> 32:33.760
<i>or shots that we got from real Marines</i>
<i>that they'd taken themselves...</i>

32:33.840 --> 32:35.930
<i>of what went on when they were in the Gulf.</i>

32:37.510 --> 32:39.180
...cleaning your <i>rifle....</i>

32:40.930 --> 32:42.770
<i>And then another time-lapse shot.</i>

32:42.850 --> 32:44.730
<i>And then over the top of this sequence....</i>

32:44.810 --> 32:47.230
<i>This sequence wasn't in the script</i>
<i>that I put in...</i>

32:47.320 --> 32:50.280
<i>because I wanted to feel</i>
<i>the beginnings of darkness...</i>

32:50.360 --> 32:53.700
<i>and the beginnings</i>
<i>of a true sense of waiting.</i>

32:54.240 --> 32:58.240
<i>And what happens to the mind</i>
<i>when it begins to lose its focus...</i>

32:58.330 --> 33:01.160
<i>and to question why it's there.</i>

33:01.290 --> 33:04.000
...left- versus right-handed
<i>masturbation....</i>

33:05.250 --> 33:07.000
<i>And this voiceover</i>
<i>was written after the event...</i>

33:07.090 --> 33:09.710
<i>and again, it's a very good bit</i>
<i>of Bill Broyles voiceover...</i>

33:09.800 --> 33:13.930
<i>that's kind of in the style of Tony Swofford</i>
<i>but isn't from the book at all...</i>

33:14.010 --> 33:16.140
<i>but is taken from various sections of it.</i>

33:17.390 --> 33:19.060
<i>The obsession with masturbation...</i>

33:19.140 --> 33:21.890
<i>and talking about women</i>
<i>and all that kind of stuff...</i>

33:21.980 --> 33:24.520
<i>that leads into this shot</i>
<i>of the "Wall of Shame"...</i>

33:24.600 --> 33:29.070
<i>where all the women</i>
<i>who have betrayed the Marines get stuck.</i>

33:29.150 --> 33:31.490
<i>And there's this great sense of self-pity...</i>

33:32.990 --> 33:34.410
<i>and, sort of, self-justification about this...</i>

33:34.490 --> 33:36.820
<i>you know, which I think</i>
<i>is slightly inappropriate...</i>

33:36.910 --> 33:39.950
<i>to the degree that I think all the</i>
<i>Marines choose to become a Marine...</i>

33:40.040 --> 33:41.580
<i>knowing that they're not going</i>
<i>to be at home...</i>

33:44.080 --> 33:47.210
<i>and then complain when their wives</i>
<i>and girlfriends say, "He's never home. "</i>

33:47.290 --> 33:49.210
<i>And you do get that a fair amount...</i>

33:49.550 --> 33:51.460
<i>but the life of the Marine is nomadic...</i>

33:51.550 --> 33:53.510
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>you're going to be away from home...</i>

33:53.590 --> 33:56.180
<i>and what happens, happens back home.</i>
<i>You leave it behind.</i>

33:56.260 --> 33:59.680
<i>So, inevitably, life moves on</i>
<i>if you're not there.</i>

34:00.640 --> 34:02.220
<i>Three days ago, as I speak...</i>

34:02.350 --> 34:04.980
<i>George Bush gave a wonderful</i>
<i>press conference to the Marines...</i>

34:05.060 --> 34:07.650
<i>telling them what they can and can't say</i>
<i>to the press.</i>

34:07.730 --> 34:09.440
<i>And as I watched it,</i>
<i>I thought of this scene...</i>

34:09.520 --> 34:12.150
<i>which is exactly the same,</i>
<i>but on a smaller scale...</i>

34:12.280 --> 34:16.280
<i>which is Staff Sergeant Sykes telling them</i>
<i>what they can and can't say to the press.</i>

34:16.449 --> 34:20.280
<i>And here's Kruger,</i>
<i>as he does in this movie, objecting...</i>

34:20.370 --> 34:21.989
<i>and just firing the truth back at Sykes...</i>

34:22.080 --> 34:25.250
<i>which is that actually he shouldn't tell them</i>
<i>what they can and can't say...</i>

34:25.330 --> 34:26.460
<i>and it's un-American.</i>

34:26.540 --> 34:27.670
<i>That's</i> un-American.

34:27.750 --> 34:29.380
Yeah, what about freedom of speech?
The Constitution?

34:29.460 --> 34:31.210
<i>And Sykes points out the simple fact...</i>

34:31.300 --> 34:33.710
<i>that it's not up to them,</i>
<i>what they can and can't say.</i>

34:33.800 --> 34:34.920
<i>It's up to the Marine Corps...</i>

34:35.010 --> 34:37.429
<i>and once they've signed a contract,</i>
<i>it's not up for debate.</i>

34:38.010 --> 34:41.469
<i>And I thought that was a great scene.</i>
<i>That's a scene straight out of the book.</i>

34:41.969 --> 34:43.600
You are a Marine.

34:43.679 --> 34:46.270
<i>There's</i> no such thing
as speech that is free.

34:46.350 --> 34:48.690
You must pay
for everything that you say.

34:51.110 --> 34:54.030
<i>And here is another</i>
<i>series of improvisations, really.</i>

34:54.110 --> 34:58.610
<i>I set up the camera one morning here</i>
<i>to do the interviews that were scripted.</i>

34:58.910 --> 35:01.950
<i>And I think only one scripted interview</i>
<i>is in the movie...</i>

35:02.030 --> 35:03.620
<i>and that is the one with Troy.</i>

35:03.700 --> 35:05.620
<i>The rest of it are improvisations.</i>

35:05.700 --> 35:09.500
<i>We always did the scripted interview,</i>
<i>and then we took it from there.</i>

35:09.830 --> 35:13.590
<i>I gave Donna Kimball, who was playing</i>
<i>the reporter, a series of questions...</i>

35:13.670 --> 35:17.220
<i>and some questions that she came up with</i>
<i>herself. She was incredibly inventive.</i>

35:17.300 --> 35:18.930
So, <i>who's</i> waiting for you back home?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.260
<i>And just pushed them</i>
<i>into talking about various things.</i>

35:23.510 --> 35:24.890
<i>The state of the food...</i>

35:24.970 --> 35:26.680
<i>if they had any messages</i>
<i>for anyone back home...</i>

35:26.770 --> 35:29.140
<i>which is what Fowler is doing right now.</i>

35:29.650 --> 35:31.230
<i>They just improvised.</i>

35:31.560 --> 35:33.400
...you are a maniac.

35:34.610 --> 35:38.110
<i>The one person who didn't want</i>
<i>to improvise, and didn't like improvising...</i>

35:38.320 --> 35:41.240
<i>was Lucas Black, who's right here now,</i>
<i>as Kruger.</i>

35:42.490 --> 35:43.780
<i>He just doesn't think like that.</i>

35:43.870 --> 35:46.500
<i>He likes to have his lines scripted</i>
<i>and all that kind of stuff.</i>

35:46.580 --> 35:51.790
<i>And this, in actual fact, is a shot of</i>
<i>Lucas Black waiting for me to say, "Action. "</i>

35:52.290 --> 35:55.000
<i>He didn't know</i>
<i>that the cameras were rolling here.</i>

35:55.340 --> 35:57.630
<i>And then we dubbed over the top</i>
<i>those questions...</i>

35:57.720 --> 35:59.300
<i>and to all intents and purposes...</i>

35:59.380 --> 36:03.260
<i>it looks like the most fantastic piece</i>
<i>of acting as he ignores every question.</i>

36:05.010 --> 36:06.970
<i>'Cause I count for something.</i>

36:07.730 --> 36:10.060
<i>And here is the scripted answer.</i>

36:10.140 --> 36:12.520
<i>Peter pulls it off 'cause he's a great actor.</i>

36:14.480 --> 36:16.980
<i>"We burn the fat off our souls."</i>

36:18.320 --> 36:20.070
Hemingway, he said that.

36:20.990 --> 36:22.990
<i>Who's</i> waiting for you back home?

36:23.320 --> 36:26.870
<i>And here we go back to Swoff.</i>
<i>We used Swoff three times in this...</i>

36:26.950 --> 36:29.710
<i>because I felt like we really needed to get</i>
<i>some kind of insight...</i>

36:29.790 --> 36:33.380
<i>into what was going on in his head.</i>
<i>It was very important for me.</i>

36:33.630 --> 36:37.000
<i>And, I guess, it was probably the biggest</i>
<i>challenge of the editing process...</i>

36:37.090 --> 36:39.800
<i>to stay in touch with what was going on</i>
<i>in Swoff's head...</i>

36:39.840 --> 36:41.680
<i>so we didn't feel disassociated from him.</i>

36:41.760 --> 36:43.430
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

36:45.720 --> 36:46.970
Hi, Kristina.

36:48.020 --> 36:50.930
<i>And although this is a very seemingly</i>
<i>simple section...</i>

36:51.020 --> 36:53.850
<i>where he decides to say something</i>
<i>to Kristina back home...</i>

36:53.940 --> 36:57.270
<i>just the very act of Swoff</i>
<i>staring into the camera...</i>

36:57.360 --> 37:00.860
<i>gave us a connection with him</i>
<i>that I thought we didn't have otherwise.</i>

37:01.450 --> 37:02.530
I love my country.

37:03.780 --> 37:06.080
I miss my parents.
Hey, Mum, hey, Dad.

37:06.780 --> 37:09.750
<i>Again, what Fergus said there,</i>
<i>that was an improvisation...</i>

37:09.830 --> 37:13.460
<i>and now what Laz Alonso is saying,</i>
<i>as Escobar, is improvised.</i>

37:14.670 --> 37:16.540
<i>When we rehearsed, we spent a long time...</i>

37:16.630 --> 37:18.250
<i>talking about the back-story</i>
<i>of all the characters...</i>

37:18.340 --> 37:21.130
<i>and where they'd come from,</i>
<i>why they'd joined up...</i>

37:21.220 --> 37:23.930
<i>and what they might say if asked</i>
<i>by reporters why they'd joined up.</i>

37:24.010 --> 37:26.470
<i>And that was something he said</i>
<i>in rehearsal, and we just used it.</i>

37:27.720 --> 37:30.310
...and to learn skills to eventually
go into law enforcement.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.060
Are you scared?

37:32.140 --> 37:34.480
<i>Jake was very, very tired</i>
<i>on the day we shot this...</i>

37:34.560 --> 37:37.020
<i>and that exhaustion...</i>

37:37.110 --> 37:40.900
<i>as is sometimes the case with actors,</i>
<i>as long as it's not a high-energy scene...</i>

37:40.990 --> 37:43.900
<i>led to him losing self-consciousness...</i>

37:44.150 --> 37:46.740
<i>and kind of feeling, a kind of relaxation...</i>

37:46.820 --> 37:48.910
<i>that doesn't happen</i>
<i>when you're trying too hard.</i>

37:49.240 --> 37:52.080
<i>And something happened in that last take,</i>
<i>which I loved.</i>

37:52.830 --> 37:55.580
<i>In which he was very honest</i>
<i>and very vulnerable...</i>

37:55.670 --> 37:57.500
<i>and when he said he was frightened</i>
<i>that the bombs were coming...</i>

37:59.040 --> 38:00.090
<i>I believed him.</i>

38:00.170 --> 38:02.880
<i>And that's really all I care about</i>
<i>in that particular section...</i>

38:02.920 --> 38:04.590
<i>that I believe that he's scared.</i>

38:05.050 --> 38:06.550
This is what we call the NBC suits.

38:06.640 --> 38:09.350
<i>That's</i> nuclear-biological-chemical
protective suits.

38:09.390 --> 38:11.890
We also have a mask.
This is the M17 A1 mask...

38:11.970 --> 38:13.520
which is fitted
with a drinking tube...

38:13.600 --> 38:15.770
so these guys
can drink from their canteens...

38:15.850 --> 38:17.100
without taking off their masks.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.440
-Oh, really?
-Want to try it?

38:18.520 --> 38:21.530
-No, thanks, but can I hold it?
-Yeah, sure.

38:21.610 --> 38:23.360
<i>-It's</i> heavy.
-Yeah, it is.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.490
But you know, we need these
in order to protect us.

38:25.570 --> 38:27.530
<i>All the video footage here...</i>

38:27.610 --> 38:31.240
<i>it was shot by our crack team,</i>
<i>led by Laura Nix...</i>

38:31.330 --> 38:34.080
<i>who, way in the background there,</i>
<i>you can see holding a boom.</i>

38:34.160 --> 38:38.250
<i>She's the lady responsible for producing</i>
<i>the documentaries on this DVD.</i>

38:38.670 --> 38:41.500
<i>There was a sense in which the people</i>
<i>who were working alongside us...</i>

38:41.590 --> 38:45.880
<i>on the documentaries</i>
<i>and on the EPK-style video diary...</i>

38:46.010 --> 38:47.380
<i>were kind of embedded with us...</i>

38:47.470 --> 38:49.180
<i>and lived through</i>
<i>the experience with us, too.</i>

38:49.260 --> 38:53.520
<i>And, I think, that's gone a long way</i>
<i>towards making this whole DVD...</i>

38:53.600 --> 38:55.350
<i>feel kind of unified...</i>

38:55.430 --> 38:57.770
<i>even though</i>
<i>we're talking about then and now.</i>

38:57.980 --> 39:00.690
<i>-That's</i> right. Come on, <i>let's</i> go.
<i>-It's</i> 112 degrees.

39:00.770 --> 39:03.900
Then I guess you <i>won't</i> be needing
your parkas, will you?

39:03.980 --> 39:05.150
<i>Let's</i> play!

39:06.990 --> 39:09.620
<i>Here we have this set piece</i>
<i>that was written about in the book...</i>

39:09.700 --> 39:12.490
<i>which is when Sykes forces them all...</i>

39:12.580 --> 39:16.290
<i>to demonstrate</i>
<i>the brilliance of the NBC suits...</i>

39:16.370 --> 39:19.670
<i>by playing a full game of football</i>
<i>in 120-degree heat.</i>

39:19.750 --> 39:22.090
<i>which is something that Tony Swofford</i>
<i>was forced to do.</i>

39:22.170 --> 39:25.130
Swofford, I guess you call that
using your head, huh?

39:25.340 --> 39:26.670
Using his head.

39:27.930 --> 39:31.550
<i>And a lot of this was very difficult to shoot,</i>
<i>as you can imagine...</i>

39:31.640 --> 39:35.310
<i>because it was very, very hot, and we were</i>
<i>out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico...</i>

39:35.390 --> 39:38.270
<i>and they were taking some very severe hits.</i>

39:38.350 --> 39:41.360
<i>Some of these are second-unit hits,</i>
<i>stuntmen, and what-have-you...</i>

39:41.440 --> 39:42.860
<i>but most of it's the guys.</i>

39:45.820 --> 39:47.700
<i>There was just</i>
<i>something animalistic about this.</i>

39:47.780 --> 39:51.820
<i>There were these ritual scenes that took</i>
<i>place in the book and in the movie...</i>

39:51.910 --> 39:56.000
<i>which were kind of</i>
<i>the tent-pole scenes for the film.</i>

39:56.160 --> 39:58.330
<i>From</i> Apocalypse Now...

39:58.410 --> 40:00.710
<i>to the scorpion fight, to the football game...</i>

40:00.790 --> 40:04.090
<i>to the party and the celebration at the end</i>
<i>when they're firing their guns...</i>

40:04.210 --> 40:07.720
<i>these were kind of collective expressions</i>
<i>of different things.</i>

40:07.800 --> 40:10.680
<i>Rage, relief, disappointment...</i>

40:11.090 --> 40:13.390
<i>and here, the need to fight...</i>

40:13.470 --> 40:17.220
<i>and the need to just feel like</i>
<i>they're engaged in something.</i>

40:17.310 --> 40:21.770
<i>Which, of course, tips over into violence</i>
<i>and insanity pretty quickly.</i>

40:22.730 --> 40:24.400
<i>Don't</i> you ever call me
a squishy-face.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.610
Squishy-face.
<i>Let's</i> go, baby, squishy-face!

40:27.690 --> 40:30.070
<i>-Let's</i> go, squishy-face.
-Motherfucker!

40:37.910 --> 40:39.870
All right, <i>that's</i> it!
<i>That's</i> halftime!

40:39.960 --> 40:41.960
Put the masks back on.
Bring the water.

40:42.040 --> 40:44.000
We're gonna further
this demonstration.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.710
Men, these M17 A1 drinking tubes...

40:46.800 --> 40:49.590
are designed to work perfectly
with your canteen and your mask.

40:49.670 --> 40:54.800
<i>And here we're mixing in video footage</i>
<i>with footage shot by Roger Deakins.</i>

40:55.100 --> 40:59.270
<i>And there's this sense in which</i>
<i>this very, very quickly grows out of hand.</i>

40:59.350 --> 41:00.850
<i>They're hot and they're frustrated...</i>

41:00.930 --> 41:04.060
<i>and suddenly, they hate their equipment,</i>
<i>and they turn on Sykes...</i>

41:04.150 --> 41:05.560
<i>and Sykes can't control them.</i>

41:05.690 --> 41:06.940
...my drinking tube fell off...

41:07.020 --> 41:09.110
at the gas chamber at Pendleton.
<i>It's</i> been four months--

41:09.190 --> 41:11.700
I understand that, and
I want everybody to understand this!

41:11.780 --> 41:14.910
-Fucking piece of shit!
-I want you to play fucking ball!

41:15.450 --> 41:17.830
Oh, <i>that's</i> a pick.

41:27.290 --> 41:28.920
Kruger of Arabia!

41:30.630 --> 41:33.470
-Kruger, field fuck.
-Field fuck?

41:35.840 --> 41:37.810
Field fuck!

41:39.260 --> 41:43.850
<i>And then, of course, out of the blue,</i>
<i>Swoff suggests this "field fuck"...</i>

41:45.150 --> 41:47.270
<i>which is this complete confrontation...</i>

41:47.360 --> 41:51.440
<i>of any homoerotic subtext</i>
<i>there may or may not be in the movie.</i>

41:51.610 --> 41:53.740
<i>It's made utterly explicit here.</i>

41:53.820 --> 41:56.910
<i>And in a way kind of dealt with,</i>
<i>I think, quite brilliantly...</i>

41:56.990 --> 41:59.700
<i>because it's so out there,</i>
<i>you know, what I mean?</i>

41:59.740 --> 42:02.830
<i>And it's so clearly</i>
<i>a way of fucking up Sykes.</i>

42:03.660 --> 42:07.420
<i>And then he has to walk off</i>
<i>and try and take the reporter away.</i>

42:08.170 --> 42:10.460
<i>And here we see all</i>
<i>the various techniques of all the guys...</i>

42:10.550 --> 42:12.340
<i>little insights into their bedrooms.</i>

42:12.920 --> 42:15.880
<i>There's Jacob, who looks very with-it...</i>

42:15.970 --> 42:18.720
<i>and Evan who looks a little bit more....</i>

42:18.800 --> 42:22.060
<i>Of course, he's in character.</i>
<i>I couldn't possibly comment on their...</i>

42:22.600 --> 42:24.690
<i>on their home lives.</i>

42:24.890 --> 42:27.600
<i>But a little bit more animalistic, let's say.</i>

42:28.310 --> 42:30.690
<i>And that's Jocko Sims down there.</i>

42:30.770 --> 42:33.990
<i>I gotta give him a mention because that's</i>
<i>really his only appearance in the film...</i>

42:34.070 --> 42:35.990
<i>and it's blowing the lead actor.</i>

42:37.030 --> 42:40.080
<i>And Jocko, if you're out there, well done.</i>

42:45.790 --> 42:48.790
<i>And then we cut straight</i>
<i>to the punishment...</i>

42:48.880 --> 42:50.630
<i>which was inevitable, I suppose.</i>

42:50.710 --> 42:51.880
I <i>don't</i> hear you laughing now.

42:54.470 --> 42:57.720
<i>This was a miserable scene to shoot</i>
<i>for the actors.</i>

42:57.800 --> 43:00.180
<i>I mean, I think you think,</i>
<i>"Well, they're just standing in the rain.</i>

43:00.260 --> 43:02.770
<i>"We stand in the rain every day,</i>
<i>on a street corner, or what-have-you. "</i>

43:02.850 --> 43:06.270
<i>But the truth is movie rain and real rain</i>
<i>are totally different.</i>

43:06.350 --> 43:08.650
<i>Movie rain is about 18 times as strong...</i>

43:08.730 --> 43:12.360
<i>because it doesn't read on camera</i>
<i>otherwise, and it's freezing cold.</i>

43:12.480 --> 43:15.530
<i>And they were shooting it over,</i>
<i>and over and over again.</i>

43:15.740 --> 43:17.490
<i>And it was a miserable night.</i>

43:17.570 --> 43:20.530
<i>And meantime, Jamie,</i>
<i>and I have to say, me...</i>

43:20.620 --> 43:22.790
<i>were sat in tents drinking coffee.</i>

43:22.870 --> 43:26.080
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>we had it lucky on this particular night.</i>

43:26.830 --> 43:28.500
<i>Colour-wise, in the movie...</i>

43:29.080 --> 43:32.750
<i>we went for a very desaturated, blown look,</i>
<i>as I mentioned earlier...</i>

43:32.840 --> 43:34.760
<i>with very occasional pops of colour...</i>

43:34.840 --> 43:38.180
<i>to remind them and us</i>
<i>what we were leaving behind them.</i>

43:38.260 --> 43:40.470
<i>Little reminders of home, in a way.</i>

43:40.550 --> 43:43.350
<i>And one of my favourite ones of those</i>
<i>is coming up just now...</i>

43:43.430 --> 43:47.100
<i>which is the Hawaiian beach chair</i>
<i>that Sykes has been sitting on.</i>

43:48.100 --> 43:49.980
Your mummy again, Fergie.

43:50.650 --> 43:52.690
<i>This push-in is a quite specific moment...</i>

43:52.770 --> 43:56.440
<i>when we.... Kind of beginning the process...</i>

43:56.530 --> 43:59.450
<i>of Swoff cutting himself off from the men...</i>

43:59.530 --> 44:01.910
<i>Iosing himself in his own paranoia,</i>
<i>his own thoughts.</i>

44:01.990 --> 44:04.450
<i>Now his worries are taking over...</i>

44:05.120 --> 44:07.830
<i>and he's beginning to lose sight of reality.</i>

44:07.870 --> 44:09.120
...the third fucking time, man.

44:09.250 --> 44:10.330
<i>What's</i> that?

44:10.420 --> 44:11.920
I just want it to say
<i>"no preference."</i>

44:12.000 --> 44:13.460
Is that so fucking hard?

44:13.540 --> 44:16.300
What difference does it make?
God knows you're "no <i>preference."</i>

44:16.380 --> 44:20.800
<i>So I let this play on the tight shot</i>
<i>with the other guys soft in the background.</i>

44:20.880 --> 44:22.430
<i>Even though Swoff wasn't really speaking...</i>

44:22.510 --> 44:25.220
<i>I could have the sense</i>
<i>that he was the centre of this scene...</i>

44:25.260 --> 44:28.020
<i>and his concerns</i>
<i>were isolating him from the group.</i>

44:28.100 --> 44:29.810
I wonder what <i>she's</i> up to?

44:29.890 --> 44:31.900
Now, I dare <i>you....</i>

44:33.110 --> 44:36.440
<i>Which, in the case of this shot right here,</i>
<i>is made explicit.</i>

44:36.530 --> 44:39.240
<i>You know, here it's very deliberately....</i>

44:39.320 --> 44:42.030
<i>I mean, I very rarely composed a shot</i>
<i>like this in the movie...</i>

44:42.070 --> 44:45.830
<i>because I felt it was too precious.</i>

44:45.910 --> 44:47.950
<i>But this is a very deliberate shot.</i>

44:48.290 --> 44:49.660
Look at that cute kid.

44:50.790 --> 44:52.040
You better check the mailman, bro.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.500
<i>Swoff is so concerned</i>
<i>with what he's going through...</i>

44:54.590 --> 44:57.460
<i>that he's missing life in the background...</i>

44:57.550 --> 45:00.630
<i>which is that one of his friends,</i>
<i>one of his compatriots, has had a child...</i>

45:00.720 --> 45:01.930
<i>and everyone's celebrating that...</i>

45:02.010 --> 45:06.390
<i>and that he's obsessed with Kristina and</i>
<i>whether Kristina is being faithful to him.</i>

45:06.470 --> 45:10.480
<i>And that that is a sign</i>
<i>that he's being cut adrift.</i>

45:14.520 --> 45:16.400
I'll put my little boy up.

45:17.070 --> 45:18.190
<i>Doesn't</i> look good.

45:18.280 --> 45:21.990
<i>That movement continues</i>
<i>all the way through the rear...</i>

45:22.070 --> 45:25.620
<i>and all the way up to the scene with Fergus</i>
<i>when he puts the gun to Fergus' head...</i>

45:25.700 --> 45:27.740
<i>which is that he's becoming self-obsessed...</i>

45:27.830 --> 45:31.500
<i>and egotistical and difficult</i>
<i>with all his buddies.</i>

45:31.710 --> 45:34.960
-Man! This is getting worse.
<i>-He's</i> fucked, man.

45:35.040 --> 45:37.380
Oh, I told you. I told you.

45:37.460 --> 45:39.710
<i>She's</i> one of those girls
with a military fetish.

45:40.210 --> 45:42.970
<i>And, of course,</i>
<i>they just really ruthlessly exploit that.</i>

45:43.050 --> 45:44.840
<i>They know he's worried about Kristina...</i>

45:44.930 --> 45:49.600
<i>so they just find that open wound</i>
<i>and they burrow into it.</i>

45:49.720 --> 45:51.060
<i>As they are doing now.</i>

45:51.140 --> 45:54.600
<i>And believe me, those guys in that tent</i>
<i>were all too happy to do that to Jake...</i>

45:54.690 --> 45:56.650
<i>by the time we got to this scene.</i>

45:58.070 --> 45:59.900
Go pull the legs off a spider.

46:00.650 --> 46:01.860
Okay, Corporal.

46:01.940 --> 46:03.650
Hey, Swoff. <i>That's</i> right.
Cheer up, man.

46:03.740 --> 46:05.740
We heading back to the rear.
We'll get some AC...

46:05.820 --> 46:08.620
shit in a flush toilet,
you can use the phone.

46:08.990 --> 46:11.290
<i>-I'm</i> gonna call her.
-You fucking A.

46:12.080 --> 46:14.580
Even if she is fucking someone else.

46:17.210 --> 46:19.800
Root beer shower!
No more monkey ass!

46:21.550 --> 46:22.800
<i>And here we are in the showers.</i>

46:22.880 --> 46:25.760
<i>We had a whole sequence</i>
<i>where we arrived in the rear.</i>

46:26.220 --> 46:29.850
<i>Went through a series...</i>

46:30.100 --> 46:33.850
<i>of little stalls run by Egyptians.</i>

46:34.770 --> 46:38.060
<i>And made it clear</i>
<i>that they were actually in the rear...</i>

46:38.150 --> 46:40.320
<i>in an old oil company compound.</i>

46:41.570 --> 46:43.400
<i>But it just seemed</i>
<i>to over-complicate the film...</i>

46:43.490 --> 46:48.570
<i>and at this point we wanted to move quickly</i>
<i>into Swoff's state of mind, I felt...</i>

46:48.660 --> 46:49.830
<i>which was this process...</i>

46:49.910 --> 46:54.660
<i>of this period of isolation, and depression</i>
<i>and paranoia.</i>

47:00.540 --> 47:02.170
<i>And here's this masturbation scene...</i>

47:02.250 --> 47:07.380
<i>which I find an incredibly sad expression</i>
<i>of loneliness and kind of pathetic.</i>

47:07.550 --> 47:08.760
Fuck!

47:09.850 --> 47:12.640
<i>And it was the last shot</i>
<i>we did in the movie, ironically...</i>

47:12.720 --> 47:16.440
<i>in a small stall somewhere</i>
<i>on the Universal stage in the backlot.</i>

47:17.310 --> 47:18.520
Hello?

47:18.600 --> 47:20.650
Kris, <i>it's</i> me.

47:20.860 --> 47:23.400
-Hello?
-Hello.

47:24.230 --> 47:25.990
Oh, my God, Tony.

47:26.820 --> 47:29.700
<i>And here's Swoff</i>
<i>finally getting to talk to Kristina...</i>

47:29.780 --> 47:32.740
<i>and unable to prevent himself...</i>

47:32.830 --> 47:36.750
<i>from asking the question that he really</i>
<i>wants to know the answer to straight away.</i>

47:37.160 --> 47:39.080
-How is she?
-Your mum?

47:39.500 --> 47:40.830
No, Rini.

47:41.420 --> 47:44.420
<i>She's</i> doing better.
<i>She's</i> doing really good.

47:45.210 --> 47:47.550
-So this guy--
-Did you get the pictures?

47:47.630 --> 47:49.970
Yeah, I got them. They're great.

47:50.260 --> 47:52.010
Did you see the one of you and me?

47:52.350 --> 47:57.390
<i>We re-recorded this a couple of times with</i>
<i>Brianne Davis, who was playing Kristina...</i>

47:57.480 --> 48:02.310
<i>just to try and get that sense in which</i>
<i>she is lying, basically...</i>

48:02.400 --> 48:06.650
<i>and that something is going on,</i>
<i>but that she's covering it up relatively well.</i>

48:06.740 --> 48:08.400
<i>But he smells something off.</i>

48:08.610 --> 48:11.120
Tony, <i>he's</i> just a friend.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.620
-Hello?
-Yeah, <i>I'm</i> here.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.290
<i>And it's a very delicate thing</i>
<i>because, you know...</i>

48:21.380 --> 48:23.920
<i>those of you who've made long-distance</i>
<i>phone calls to loved ones...</i>

48:24.000 --> 48:26.960
<i>will know</i>
<i>that sense of hanging on every word...</i>

48:27.050 --> 48:31.550
<i>and misinterpreting or re-interpreting things</i>
<i>that they may say.</i>

48:33.100 --> 48:36.180
<i>And we go into what we think is a reality...</i>

48:36.270 --> 48:39.390
<i>and in actual fact is a kind of,</i>
<i>what is a dream state.</i>

48:39.850 --> 48:45.020
<i>And I'm very, very grateful to Courtney Love</i>
<i>and Pete Asher, the manager of Nirvana...</i>

48:45.110 --> 48:47.320
<i>for giving us the rights to use...</i>

48:47.400 --> 48:50.780
Something In The Way,
<i>which is the most amazing track.</i>

48:52.280 --> 48:55.620
<i>It's traditionally been the case</i>
<i>that Nirvana haven't granted the rights...</i>

48:55.700 --> 48:57.490
<i>to use any of their songs in movies.</i>

48:57.580 --> 49:01.420
<i>And there's a line towards the end of the</i>
<i>film when they're in the night-time desert...</i>

49:01.500 --> 49:04.080
<i>"That's Vietnam music, man.</i>
<i>Can't we get our own fucking music?"</i>

49:04.170 --> 49:05.290
<i>And I felt it was very important...</i>

49:05.380 --> 49:08.550
<i>given the fact that, that line was</i>
<i>in the movie, to have our own music.</i>

49:08.630 --> 49:12.090
<i>And to have the music of the period</i>
<i>that in some way defined that era.</i>

49:12.260 --> 49:17.430
<i>And there's no greater expression of that,</i>
<i>I think, than Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.</i>

49:20.640 --> 49:24.690
<i>And this, I suppose, is the first moment you</i>
<i>realise it is a dream, when you see Kristina.</i>

49:24.770 --> 49:28.900
<i>And there she is wearing her USMC T-shirt,</i>
<i>which you can't really see.</i>

49:29.900 --> 49:33.570
<i>And this astonishing bit of lighting</i>
<i>by Roger Deakins.</i>

49:35.910 --> 49:39.330
<i>This was based loosely on a dream</i>
<i>that Tony recounted in the book...</i>

49:39.410 --> 49:42.370
<i>in which he actually vomited glass.</i>

49:43.250 --> 49:46.840
<i>But I felt that the sand</i>
<i>just felt more comprehensible, I think.</i>

49:47.000 --> 49:50.630
<i>The sense in which he was choking from it</i>
<i>and it was inside him now...</i>

49:50.710 --> 49:53.720
<i>and he was unable to breathe</i>
<i>and he couldn't escape.</i>

49:54.590 --> 49:58.390
<i>In this sequence, in the book,</i>
<i>Tony contemplated committing suicide.</i>

49:58.470 --> 50:01.180
<i>We talked a lot about putting that</i>
<i>in the movie, Bill and I...</i>

50:01.270 --> 50:04.190
<i>but, in the end, we decided</i>
<i>that the more important scene...</i>

50:04.270 --> 50:07.560
<i>was the scene in which he threatens Fergus</i>
<i>and puts a gun to his head.</i>

50:07.690 --> 50:11.070
<i>And we kind of</i>
<i>wrote that into the Fergus scene.</i>

50:11.570 --> 50:12.820
Shut the fuck up.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.780
You shut up already.

50:15.740 --> 50:16.990
Yeah!

50:18.330 --> 50:21.040
Get your boot off my fucking chair,
you fucking boot.

50:22.080 --> 50:24.420
Rude motherfucker, Swoff.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.800
<i>And this is a scene, again, from the book...</i>

50:31.130 --> 50:33.670
<i>that was slightly incomprehensible, actually.</i>

50:33.760 --> 50:38.390
<i>It was just a guy's wife sent him</i>
<i>a tape of her being fucked by the neighbour.</i>

50:38.470 --> 50:40.010
<i>But there didn't seem to be</i>
<i>any reason for that.</i>

50:40.100 --> 50:42.810
<i>So, one of the things we were</i>
<i>very conscious of in this scene...</i>

50:42.850 --> 50:47.310
<i>was trying to make sure that we understood</i>
<i>why she was doing it.</i>

50:47.400 --> 50:50.270
<i>And towards the end, when she says,</i>
<i>"Who's fucking around now, Brian?"</i>

50:50.360 --> 50:51.980
<i>Well, that explains it.</i>

50:52.070 --> 50:54.700
<i>And one of the things that Marty Papazian</i>
<i>does so well in this scene...</i>

50:54.780 --> 50:56.700
<i>and this is a pretty amazing performance...</i>

50:56.780 --> 50:59.780
<i>he establishes very quickly</i>
<i>that the guy's a bit of an arsehole.</i>

50:59.870 --> 51:01.540
<i>You know, he's kind of unpleasant</i>
<i>to people...</i>

51:01.620 --> 51:05.250
<i>he's got a big mouth, he's sitting right</i>
<i>in the middle like he owns the place.</i>

51:05.330 --> 51:06.870
<i>And then this happens to him...</i>

51:06.960 --> 51:10.250
<i>and he kind of becomes a little boy</i>
<i>and he says, "I wanna go home. "</i>

51:10.380 --> 51:11.670
Oh, fuck, baby.

51:11.750 --> 51:14.090
You <i>don't</i> need to see this.
Swoff, come on.

51:14.170 --> 51:16.880
-Take him outside.
-Come on, Dettman. Come on.

51:22.350 --> 51:24.350
Fuck! I wanna go home!

51:26.190 --> 51:27.440
I wanna go home.

51:32.400 --> 51:34.110
<i>Who's</i> fucking around now, Brian?

51:37.820 --> 51:41.240
<i>One of the weirdest days on the film, in fact,</i>
<i>was shooting the porn video...</i>

51:41.330 --> 51:44.040
<i>or the homemade porn video. That was odd.</i>

51:46.660 --> 51:50.040
<i>But the guys were very good</i>
<i>and they made it very easy for me.</i>

51:50.830 --> 51:52.290
<i>And, again, you know,</i>
<i>it's one of those things...</i>

51:52.380 --> 51:54.760
<i>that having quoted</i> Full Metal Jacket
<i>at the beginning of the movie...</i>

51:54.840 --> 51:55.920
<i>and watched</i> Apocalypse Now...

51:56.010 --> 52:00.890
<i>here they were ready to get stoked up</i>
<i>by using another Vietnam movie.</i>

52:01.720 --> 52:04.560
<i>Because, you know, in many ways,</i>
<i>our experiences of these wars...</i>

52:04.640 --> 52:06.730
<i>are through the movies</i>
<i>and not through the reality.</i>

52:06.810 --> 52:09.060
<i>And certainly our collective experiences.</i>

52:09.730 --> 52:13.940
<i>And here was a scene that used to be</i>
<i>set outside and that Jake and Peter and I...</i>

52:14.070 --> 52:17.110
<i>kind of changed again</i>
<i>the day before we shot it.</i>

52:19.700 --> 52:23.160
<i>It was Jake's idea that he would be</i>
<i>the person to say, "Let's play it again. "</i>

52:23.240 --> 52:25.490
<i>Originally, it was Fowler</i>
<i>who was gonna do that.</i>

52:25.870 --> 52:28.160
<i>But I was very excited by the surprise...</i>

52:28.250 --> 52:31.210
<i>of Jake, of Swoff, being the person</i>
<i>to turn round and do it...</i>

52:31.290 --> 52:33.790
<i>and then for Troy to know</i>
<i>that something was wrong.</i>

52:33.880 --> 52:36.710
<i>And for him to hold his feet to the flames...</i>

52:36.800 --> 52:40.590
<i>and in the process,</i>
<i>get underneath what was really wrong.</i>

52:40.680 --> 52:44.390
<i>And I think that it's one of the best bits</i>
<i>of acting in the film that Jake does...</i>

52:44.470 --> 52:49.560
<i>this turning point from bullish defiance</i>
<i>and childish resentment of Troy...</i>

52:49.640 --> 52:51.900
<i>to this shot where he looks like...</i>

52:51.980 --> 52:55.190
<i>a 12-year-old who's just lost his parents.</i>

52:55.320 --> 52:59.950
<i>I mean, he's just utterly, utterly bereft</i>
<i>and completely lost.</i>

53:00.240 --> 53:02.570
Come on. Get your shit.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.200
Come on. We're going back.

53:13.710 --> 53:15.750
<i>And here we have this sequence again...</i>

53:15.840 --> 53:17.800
<i>accompanied by a voiceover</i>
<i>that was written in post...</i>

53:18.510 --> 53:23.680
<i>just to get the sense that he is now lost</i>
<i>and not quite sure where to go next.</i>

53:25.680 --> 53:27.220
<i>So that when he walks in...</i>

53:27.310 --> 53:30.350
<i>to pick up the hooch</i>
<i>and to pick up the booze in the next scene...</i>

53:30.560 --> 53:33.400
<i>he is kind of going a little crazy.</i>

53:34.770 --> 53:37.230
<i>But also in this sequence</i>
<i>there is some indication...</i>

53:38.480 --> 53:41.200
<i>of how much the camp is growing</i>
<i>and how many people are there...</i>

53:41.280 --> 53:44.570
<i>how much he's lost</i>
<i>within this huge number of people...</i>

53:44.660 --> 53:47.200
<i>that are gradually accumulating</i>
<i>in the desert.</i>

53:47.280 --> 53:48.540
<i>And now we walk into...</i>

53:48.620 --> 53:52.410
<i>this tent full of people planning the war</i>
<i>and people writing about the war...</i>

53:52.500 --> 53:54.330
<i>and people making communications...</i>

53:54.420 --> 53:57.340
<i>and we come across</i>
<i>Corporal Harrigan here...</i>

53:58.920 --> 54:02.550
<i>who I became aware of</i>
<i>through the American version of</i> The Office.

54:02.630 --> 54:05.220
<i>He's a fantastically gifted actor, John.</i>

54:06.260 --> 54:07.550
...read this.

54:08.310 --> 54:10.060
-What is it?
<i>-It's</i> a love <i>letter....</i>

54:10.140 --> 54:14.060
<i>And this bizarre echo</i>
<i>that keeps coming back to Swoff...</i>

54:14.140 --> 54:16.360
<i>of all the women</i>
<i>that are betraying everyone...</i>

54:16.440 --> 54:20.360
<i>or this fact that other people are having</i>
<i>these relationships that he's not having.</i>

54:20.610 --> 54:24.280
<i>And this kind of jaunty, sort of fake jollity...</i>

54:24.360 --> 54:28.740
<i>that Jake has got, that he puts on here,</i>
<i>which is about to crack.</i>

54:28.830 --> 54:30.240
$40, five gallons.

54:36.130 --> 54:38.670
Hey, Swoff.
Which way do I mount this?

54:38.750 --> 54:41.630
<i>Here's Brian Geraghty, who,</i>
<i>I think, is absolutely amazing in the film.</i>

54:41.710 --> 54:44.430
<i>Brian is absolutely nothing like</i>
<i>the character he plays.</i>

54:44.510 --> 54:47.850
<i>He has the same softness, obviously,</i>
<i>of voice and face...</i>

54:47.930 --> 54:50.970
<i>but he is a very smart guy</i>
<i>and a very, very good actor.</i>

54:51.060 --> 54:54.480
<i>And I think it is a very difficult part to play.</i>

54:54.560 --> 54:57.560
<i>-It's</i> Christmas Eve.
-I'll send you out a fucking tree.

54:57.650 --> 55:00.480
Oh, great, a tree. Merry Christmas.

55:02.360 --> 55:06.030
<i>I gave these guys</i>
<i>six songs at the party to learn, basically.</i>

55:06.110 --> 55:08.370
<i>One of them was</i> OPP,
<i>by Naughty by Nature...</i>

55:08.450 --> 55:11.160
<i>which many of them knew anyway,</i>
<i>kind of having grown up with it.</i>

55:11.240 --> 55:15.410
<i>And there were several scenes in this movie</i>
<i>that I kind of threw Roger Deakins...</i>

55:15.500 --> 55:18.630
<i>and Scott Sakamoto was the second camera</i>
<i>operator and the Steadicam operator...</i>

55:18.710 --> 55:21.840
<i>into without telling them</i>
<i>what was going to happen.</i>

55:21.920 --> 55:23.420
<i>And this was one of them. I just said...</i>

55:23.510 --> 55:25.760
<i>"You know what?</i>
<i>The guys are just gonna do their thing.</i>

55:25.840 --> 55:28.220
<i>"They're gonna party.</i>
<i>Jacob might breakdance. "</i>

55:28.300 --> 55:30.510
<i>I remember Lucas Black doing the worm.</i>

55:30.600 --> 55:34.560
<i>"And you just go</i>
<i>where you think you should go.</i>

55:34.640 --> 55:35.770
<i>"Treat it in a documentary way. "</i>

55:35.850 --> 55:37.190
<i>And it was exciting that way...</i>

55:37.270 --> 55:40.480
<i>because there was obviously nothing</i>
<i>happened the same twice...</i>

55:40.940 --> 55:42.110
<i>but it didn't need to...</i>

55:42.190 --> 55:46.950
<i>because I knew we were going to cut it</i>
<i>in a particular way that wasn't linear.</i>

55:48.860 --> 55:52.120
<i>And then we go outside, shot totally</i>
<i>at a different time and a different place...</i>

55:52.200 --> 55:55.620
<i>to Fergus making his sausages.</i>
<i>And then back and forth.</i>

55:56.000 --> 55:58.420
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>about the editing of this sequence...</i>

55:58.500 --> 56:03.130
<i>was just trying to get the rhythm,</i>
<i>the back-forth rhythm as good as possible.</i>

56:09.550 --> 56:14.220
<i>And the sense that this wildness</i>
<i>and this alcoholic...</i>

56:15.390 --> 56:18.020
<i>excitement was building up in the tent...</i>

56:18.100 --> 56:21.520
<i>while Fergus was chilling out</i>
<i>to his mother's Christmas tape outside.</i>

56:27.950 --> 56:32.070
<i>This took a while,</i>
<i>to try and get the trousers to catch fire...</i>

56:32.160 --> 56:35.410
<i>and we had wind machines</i>
<i>and pyrotechnics and what-have-you.</i>

56:35.490 --> 56:37.790
<i>Sometimes, it's the simplest things</i>
<i>that take the longest.</i>

56:37.870 --> 56:41.500
<i>You know, you wanna set up</i>
<i>a big explosion, it's pretty straight-forward.</i>

56:41.580 --> 56:43.840
<i>You wanna set up a tiny thing</i>
<i>that catches fire...</i>

56:43.920 --> 56:46.090
<i>and then something else catches fire</i>
<i>off that...</i>

56:46.170 --> 56:47.800
<i>it's actually quite difficult.</i>

56:49.840 --> 56:52.550
<i>And this is them getting wild in the tent...</i>

56:52.590 --> 56:55.100
<i>probably listening to Guns N' Roses,</i>
<i>actually, rather than to</i> OPP...

56:55.180 --> 56:57.980
<i>but we just wanted to have one track.</i>

56:58.180 --> 56:59.770
What the fuck?

57:01.190 --> 57:05.610
<i>And then this high jinks of hearing...</i>

57:05.690 --> 57:09.110
<i>what they think is an enemy attack outside</i>
<i>and responding accordingly...</i>

57:09.190 --> 57:11.820
<i>Iooking absolutely ridiculous as they go.</i>

57:15.120 --> 57:18.120
<i>This was a scene in the book</i>
<i>in which Fergus just fell asleep.</i>

57:18.200 --> 57:20.330
<i>And I read on an Internet diary...</i>

57:20.410 --> 57:24.630
<i>a story of someone who'd told someone else</i>
<i>a story of someone who'd fallen asleep...</i>

57:24.840 --> 57:27.250
<i>and their fire had tipped over...</i>

57:27.340 --> 57:31.010
<i>and set off a bunch of rockets,</i>
<i>actually, not even flares.</i>

57:31.510 --> 57:34.350
<i>And I took that, and Bill and I
developed it into this scene...</i>

57:34.430 --> 57:37.310
<i>so that Fergus would do something</i>
<i>so substantial...</i>

57:37.390 --> 57:39.220
<i>that it would humiliate the whole camp.</i>

57:44.020 --> 57:46.730
<i>It was kind of a chain-of-events decision....</i>

57:46.820 --> 57:51.150
<i>I wanted to make something so big</i>
<i>that this scene and his demotion...</i>

57:51.320 --> 57:53.910
<i>was a very public event.</i>

57:58.830 --> 58:00.580
<i>Here's a scene from the book.</i>

58:00.660 --> 58:04.670
<i>Forced to drink water until he vomits.</i>

58:05.290 --> 58:09.250
<i>And punished first in this way</i>
<i>and then by burning the shitters.</i>

58:09.710 --> 58:11.630
...out of your system?

58:12.680 --> 58:17.300
<i>Here's another splash of colour also, this</i>
<i>Santa hat that we decided to keep on him.</i>

58:17.390 --> 58:21.730
<i>I felt like Sykes would force him to wear it,</i>
<i>a little bit like it was a dunce cap.</i>

58:21.810 --> 58:23.980
<i>You know,</i>
<i>"I want everyone to know the idiot...</i>

58:24.060 --> 58:26.230
<i>"who nearly burnt down</i>
<i>the camp last night.</i>

58:26.310 --> 58:29.150
<i>"And I want everyone to spot him</i>
<i>from a thousand yards. "</i>

58:30.030 --> 58:33.320
You think you're the only one
<i>that's</i> bored around here?

58:34.950 --> 58:36.820
<i>It also was this kind of image...</i>

58:36.910 --> 58:39.700
<i>of Swoff as this joker,</i>
<i>this strange outsider in the camp.</i>

58:39.950 --> 58:42.580
<i>By this time, he's divorced himself</i>
<i>from almost everyone...</i>

58:42.790 --> 58:45.000
<i>and he's very, very isolated.</i>

58:45.120 --> 58:49.590
<i>And that was something I was seeking</i>
<i>to express in the next shot here...</i>

58:49.960 --> 58:54.050
<i>which is him, for the only time</i>
<i>almost in the movie, shot in a camp...</i>

58:54.130 --> 58:58.640
<i>alone in the landscape of the camp.</i>
<i>Very isolated, very solitary.</i>

59:01.020 --> 59:02.560
Hold it right there, Marine.

59:02.850 --> 59:04.810
<i>Dennis Gassner, the production designer...</i>

59:04.890 --> 59:07.600
<i>did an incredible, selfless job</i>
<i>on this movie...</i>

59:07.650 --> 59:09.940
<i>because it's a production designer's</i>
<i>nightmare, really.</i>

59:10.020 --> 59:11.980
<i>Because there's no fantasy landscapes.</i>

59:12.070 --> 59:14.190
<i>There's no.... There's nothing to sort of</i>
<i>get their teeth into.</i>

59:14.280 --> 59:17.450
<i>What they're doing is they're building</i>
<i>a camp in the middle of nowhere...</i>

59:17.530 --> 59:18.740
<i>and they're moving sand...</i>

59:18.820 --> 59:21.910
<i>and they're constructing spaces</i>
<i>within spaces, within spaces.</i>

59:21.990 --> 59:26.250
<i>You know, interiors of tents,</i>
<i>tents within camps...</i>

59:26.420 --> 59:28.790
<i>camps within deserts</i>
<i>and all that kind of stuff.</i>

59:28.880 --> 59:30.750
<i>And he did a brilliant, brilliant job.</i>

59:33.800 --> 59:36.880
<i>One of the things he and I were really</i>
<i>tickled by were these sort of little...</i>

59:36.970 --> 59:40.050
<i>wooden Tardis-like structures</i>
<i>that dotted the edge of the camp...</i>

59:40.140 --> 59:42.310
<i>which were the shitters and the showers.</i>

59:42.390 --> 59:45.520
<i>And there was this whole string</i>
<i>of details in the book...</i>

59:45.680 --> 59:48.730
<i>about things like this</i>
<i>that really made you feel like...</i>

59:48.810 --> 59:51.320
<i>you were living the day-to-day life</i>
<i>of a Marine.</i>

59:51.480 --> 59:55.110
<i>And it was that texture and that level</i>
<i>of interest and those...</i>

59:55.280 --> 59:59.070
<i>amazing little details that jumped out of it</i>
<i>at you that really made me...</i>

59:59.160 --> 01:00:03.740
<i>want to make this film and focus on</i>
<i>what happened to him in the desert.</i>

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:09.710
<i>It's the specifics. The fact that you need</i>
<i>a pair of welder's gloves...</i>

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.380
<i>and an iron fence post</i>
<i>to stir the burning shit.</i>

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.340
<i>Always, I don't know. It always stood out.</i>

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:28.390
<i>And then, with the help of a very skillful</i>
<i>Tom Newman cue, we kind of...</i>

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.560
<i>explode or arrive into this scene...</i>

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:33.980
<i>which is the beginning of the confrontation</i>
<i>between Swoff and Fergus.</i>

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.610
<i>And this, I suppose,</i>
<i>has been building for a long time.</i>

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:39.950
<i>I think when you train a man</i>
<i>to use a weapon...</i>

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:41.700
<i>and then you don't allow them to use it...</i>

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.740
<i>or use it in the way</i>
<i>they're expecting to use it...</i>

01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:48.410
<i>in the end, it will come out in other ways,</i>
<i>whether it's to do with the weapon or not.</i>

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:50.080
<i>And in this case, it is.</i>

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:51.540
How many is that, Cortez?

01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:56.130
<i>Swoff is angry with Fergus</i>
<i>and something snaps in him...</i>

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:58.380
<i>that's been waiting to snap.</i>

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.180
<i>And it was a really,</i>
<i>really interesting scene to shoot...</i>

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.890
<i>and you'll see something about this</i>
<i>on the DVD additional documentary...</i>

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:07.310
<i>the video diary.</i>

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:12.270
<i>And it was interesting because it was</i>
<i>the scene that Jake auditioned with...</i>

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.190
<i>and he felt he auditioned very badly...</i>

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:18.690
<i>and compared to what he is doing on film</i>
<i>here, he didn't audition particularly well...</i>

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.200
<i>but I wasn't expecting him to go full-out.</i>
<i>He was at my kitchen table.</i>

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:25.990
<i>But something happened to him in that,</i>
<i>which is that he...</i>

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:28.790
<i>felt that because I'd asked him to audition</i>
<i>with this scene...</i>

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:32.370
<i>this for me was the most important scene</i>
<i>in the movie for him as an actor.</i>

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.960
<i>And so, he kind of froze</i>
<i>the first day we shot it.</i>

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.000
<i>And we started on him and he couldn't do it.</i>

01:01:37.090 --> 01:01:40.470
<i>So, we turned around</i>
<i>and shot Fergus' direction first.</i>

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.180
<i>-That's</i> it.
-What do you think, Cortez?

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:44.390
You think I'll accidentally kill
your homeboy from boot camp?

01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:45.760
Sure you'll kill him.
Accidents happen.

01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:50.310
<i>And during that, Jake warmed up and the</i>
<i>next morning, he came in really focussed.</i>

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.480
<i>But he was so tense that...</i>

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.780
<i>he was really quite out of control of what he</i>
<i>was doing with his body and his hands...</i>

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.570
<i>and as he jams the barrel of the rifle</i>
<i>into Fergus' cheek here...</i>

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.240
<i>he was pushing it really pretty hard.</i>

01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:06.580
<i>And gradually during the course</i>
<i>of the morning...</i>

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.750
<i>Brian Geraghty's cheeks</i>
<i>got more and more swollen.</i>

01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:12.790
<i>And Brian being a mensch
and a general good chap...</i>

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:15.250
<i>didn't really say anything about it</i>
<i>but kept saying.</i>

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:18.380
<i>"Can you ask Jake</i>
<i>to not push quite so hard?"</i>

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.840
Repeat after me.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.840
Repeat after me!

01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.510
-This is my rifle.
-There you go. <i>That's</i> right.

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:31.350
<i>And the scene got more and more tense...</i>

01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:34.770
<i>and Jake had to remember</i>
<i>this machine-gun dialogue...</i>

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:37.230
<i>that had to come out,</i>
<i>pouring out at great speed.</i>

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:42.150
<i>And I told him, when he stopped,</i>
<i>to not stop and go back to the beginning...</i>

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.070
<i>or for me to say, "Cut. "</i>

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:47.120
<i>I told him to shout "wrong" at himself</i>
<i>and start again.</i>

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.160
<i>So he became kind of insane.</i>

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:51.620
Without me, <i>I'm....</i>

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:53.120
This is my rifle.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:56.380
<i>And by the time he got through the end,</i>
<i>he was so wound up...</i>

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.340
<i>as you see now,</i>
<i>that he kind of went berserk.</i>

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.720
<i>And when he turned the barrel on himself...</i>

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.300
<i>he jammed the barrel into his mouth</i>
<i>and knocked out his front tooth.</i>

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.180
<i>At which point, he walked off-camera.</i>

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.720
<i>And I was about to say, "cut"</i>
<i>and he walked back on again...</i>

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:13.020
<i>with blood coming out of his mouth</i>
<i>and carried on.</i>

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.900
<i>That's actually not the take you're seeing</i>
<i>now, strangely. This is the take before.</i>

01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:21.280
<i>And he was so out of control</i>
<i>he started slapping Brian around the head...</i>

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.190
<i>in character and in the scene</i>
<i>with the dialogue.</i>

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:28.740
<i>And Brian, who I'd said, "You can say 'cut'</i>
<i>whenever you want", didn't say "cut".</i>

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:32.040
<i>And it went on. Eventually, I said "cut",</i>
<i>and Brian was very, very upset.</i>

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.790
<i>He felt that he was being abused by Jake.</i>
<i>And in a way, he was.</i>

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:40.540
<i>But I tell this story as an indication</i>
<i>of when you want people to act...</i>

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:43.960
<i>on the edge here and this extreme,</i>
<i>the line between...</i>

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:46.720
<i>punishing someone and acting</i>
<i>punishing someone, is very, very, very slim.</i>

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:53.560
<i>Brian took a while...</i>

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.730
<i>to forgive Jake.</i>

01:03:54.810 --> 01:03:57.770
<i>But I felt that because of what happened</i>
<i>in that scene...</i>

01:03:57.940 --> 01:04:00.980
<i>because I realised how humiliating</i>
<i>it had been for Brian...</i>

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:03.230
<i>the reality of someone turning</i>
<i>a gun on you...</i>

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.240
<i>and sticking it in your face</i>
<i>became greater for me.</i>

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.950
<i>And I realised that in the script</i>
<i>we didn't have a scene...</i>

01:04:09.030 --> 01:04:12.200
<i>in which Swoff apologised to Fergus</i>
<i>and it was essential...</i>

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.540
<i>for the movie and for Swoff's journey</i>
<i>as a character...</i>

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.540
<i>that he confronted what he had done.</i>

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.620
<i>And from that point on...</i>

01:04:18.830 --> 01:04:22.840
<i>he was a different person</i>
<i>and a better Marine, ironically.</i>

01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:24.670
<i>And so that's what we did.</i>

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:27.970
<i>And the turning point, therefore,</i>
<i>of Swoff's entire character...</i>

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:31.050
<i>which I think is this moment</i>
<i>when he turns around and says he's sorry.</i>

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:34.890
<i>After which, he ceases to be</i>
<i>the egotistical creature...</i>

01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:37.690
<i>that we've got to know</i>
<i>in the previous half-an-hour...</i>

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.190
<i>and starts being some kind</i>
<i>of human being again.</i>

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.570
<i>That turning point was written two days</i>
<i>before the scene was shot.</i>

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:48.200
<i>I'm</i> sorry, man.

01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:56.040
<i>And was entirely a response</i>
<i>to a scene that we'd shot in sequence...</i>

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:58.410
<i>which is one of the great things</i>
<i>about shooting a sequence.</i>

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.500
<i>One of the great things about working</i>
<i>with actors who know what they're doing...</i>

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.290
<i>and have rehearsed</i>
<i>and are used to improvising...</i>

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.210
<i>because, basically, we improvised a scene,</i>
<i>sent it to Bill...</i>

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.930
<i>Bill rewrote it,</i>
<i>and then we printed out the pages...</i>

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.390
<i>and that's the scene</i>
<i>that you see onscreen now.</i>

01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:15.060
Army has satellites,
and we have this fucking shit.

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.600
<i>That was one of the pleasures for me</i>
<i>about doing this movie...</i>

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.600
<i>is that we were able to respond...</i>

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:25.190
<i>quickly and accurately</i>
<i>to what the actors were doing...</i>

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:27.360
<i>right in front of our eyes, all the time.</i>

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.650
<i>I mean, minute-to-minute,</i>
<i>not just day-to-day.</i>

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:38.250
<i>So, here we go into this Bedouin scene</i>
<i>which I took out for a long period in the cut.</i>

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.960
<i>When I first put the movie</i>
<i>together and showed it to the studio...</i>

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.460
<i>this scene wasn't featured.</i>

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.210
<i>Because I felt it was texture,</i>
<i>and it didn't really have a point.</i>

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.590
<i>But what I realise now, retrospectively...</i>

01:05:49.670 --> 01:05:51.930
<i>now putting it back in,</i>
<i>and what I hope is the case...</i>

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:55.390
<i>is that finally, it adds some kind of tension.</i>

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:58.850
<i>Military tension, I mean,</i>
<i>they point their guns at something.</i>

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:01.940
<i>They have what they think are</i>
<i>the enemy facing them.</i>

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:04.980
<i>Now, the fact that they're not</i>
<i>is not available to the audience, yet.</i>

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:07.900
<i>That tension is something that we've</i>
<i>been craving for the last...</i>

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.610
<i>thirty, forty minutes of the movie...</i>

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:12.490
<i>and we need to feel like there</i>
<i>is some threat out there.</i>

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.530
<i>Also, they represent, in a way,</i>
<i>a gradual encroachment...</i>

01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:21.910
<i>of the desert into their world,</i>
<i>into their environment.</i>

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.710
<i>The sudden realisation</i>
<i>that they're actually not alone out there...</i>

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:29.510
<i>and that there are enemy over the horizon</i>
<i>and that it's coming down quite quickly.</i>

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:38.720
<i>When this Bedouin scene was first written,</i>
<i>it was much more involved.</i>

01:06:38.810 --> 01:06:41.600
<i>Swoff went all the way up to the Bedouin.</i>
<i>We went up with him.</i>

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.520
<i>We heard the dialogue between them</i>
<i>and all that kind of thing.</i>

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:49.440
<i>And then, when we got to the scene</i>
<i>I just felt it was wrong.</i>

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:54.240
<i>It was too mundane to go up with them.</i>
<i>And it was too, somehow predictable.</i>

01:06:54.450 --> 01:06:58.120
<i>The whole</i>
<i>"these guys are humans too" line.</i>

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.450
<i>"These are all people who live there. "
It seemed a little obvious.</i>

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:07.330
<i>So, I stayed back,</i>
<i>in the point of view of Troy, mostly...</i>

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.670
<i>and shot the scene at a distance, which I felt</i>
<i>retained the mystery of the Bedouin...</i>

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.510
<i>without really seeing their face.</i>

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:16.680
<i>So that they were these figures</i>
<i>who emerged out of the mirage...</i>

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.640
<i>and kind of retreated back there,</i>
<i>these amazing indigenous desert folk.</i>

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:26.190
<i>And as a consequence</i>
<i>this scene remained in the film.</i>

01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:28.440
<i>I think otherwise it probably wouldn't</i>
<i>have made it in...</i>

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.440
<i>because, I think it would've been</i>
<i>a little bit too ordinary.</i>

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:37.610
<i>But there's something, also, about</i>
<i>the reality of when you're confronted...</i>

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.160
<i>with an enemy that isn't aggressive</i>
<i>or who you think is an enemy.</i>

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:43.450
<i>How do you go about dealing with them?</i>

01:07:43.540 --> 01:07:46.580
<i>And I think that Troy's line,</i>
<i>"Well, what do we do now?"</i>

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:50.920
<i>I think it's a really good line, but it's also</i>
<i>a line, again, improvised by Peter.</i>

01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:59.010
<i>Joe, our Arabic advisor,</i>
<i>gave Jake the line</i> "ana <i>sadiak"...</i>

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:02.180
<i>which I think means, "Good afternoon",</i>
<i>or "How are you?"</i>

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:05.060
<i>But that was prompted by...</i>

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.600
<i>me studying one of the Marine guidebooks...</i>

01:08:07.690 --> 01:08:11.610
<i>which had a page full of Arabic expressions</i>
<i>spelt phonetically.</i>

01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:15.530
<i>So, I thought it would be credible</i>
<i>that he would learn a line of Arabic...</i>

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:17.200
<i>and be able to deliver it to them.</i>

01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:19.279
Swoff spoke Arabic.

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:23.240
Sounded like a duck fucking
or something, but he spoke Arabic.

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:25.790
Oh, yeah, yeah. But at least
we finally saw something.

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.410
You guys should see
what the .40 does...

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:28.620
to the head
of a fucking <i>camel....</i>

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:32.250
<i>And then we get this scene again which,</i>
<i>on the face of it, is just texture, really.</i>

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.420
<i>It's not pushing the story on</i>
<i>and so much of this movie...</i>

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.680
<i>you know, is not narrative-based,</i>
<i>it's not a story...</i>

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:41.470
<i>but needs to give you the feeling</i>
<i>that a story is being told...</i>

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:43.470
<i>and a narrative is taking place all the time.</i>

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.140
<i>And that was one of the things that was</i>
<i>most difficult for Walter Murch and I...</i>

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:49.229
<i>in the editorial process.</i>

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:52.819
<i>And here's Fowler doing something....</i>
<i>You know, early on...</i>

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:56.109
<i>they might have found him amusing</i>
<i>and now, progressively...</i>

01:08:56.279 --> 01:09:00.859
<i>he's stepping over the boundaries</i>
<i>and they actually do have some kind of...</i>

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:03.660
<i>moral compass, and think that what he</i>
<i>is doing is pathetic...</i>

01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.290
<i>as you can see by the look</i>
<i>on all of their faces when he does it.</i>

01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:09.250
-Sit down, Fowler.
<i>-That's</i> the one. You saw.

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:11.250
<i>And then this stuff at the end...</i>

01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:16.510
<i>that Evan says, that Fowler says over</i>
<i>to Jake is improvised, too.</i>

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:20.470
<i>We were very lucky to have</i>
<i>that improvised line because it kind of...</i>

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:22.930
<i>pointed the way forward</i>
<i>to the beginning of the war.</i>

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.930
Your day will come, man.
Your day will come.

01:09:28.979 --> 01:09:33.729
<i>And here we go into what is effectively</i>
<i>the beginning of the war...</i>

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:39.240
<i>as Staff Sergeant Sykes reads out</i>
<i>the message from Saddam.</i>

01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:42.160
...you better not consider this
a bunch of bullshit.

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:45.779
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>that is very similar between...</i>

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.080
<i>the war in 1991 and the war now is...</i>

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.580
<i>and I felt this very much at the time,</i>
<i>the mythologizing of Saddam...</i>

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:58.170
<i>as this kind of bogeyman</i>
<i>who has more weaponry...</i>

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:01.130
<i>more force, more power than he really does.</i>

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:02.930
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>Chris Cooper's character...</i>

01:10:03.010 --> 01:10:05.600
<i>says in the first speech he gives</i>
<i>to the troops...</i>

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.060
<i>is that there's a million-man Iraqi Army,</i>
<i>the Republican Guard...</i>

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.230
<i>trained in chemical weapons.</i>

01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.190
<i>And here, in a minute...</i>

01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:19.400
<i>Staff Sergeant Sykes reminds the men</i>
<i>that they expect 30,000 casualties...</i>

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.070
<i>on the first day of the war.</i>

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:23.910
<i>And, of course, this is very like</i>
<i>what's happened since then...</i>

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:28.830
<i>which is that we have been promised that</i>
<i>Saddam has weapons of mass destruction...</i>

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:32.410
<i>we have been promised that he has</i>
<i>a nuclear armoury underway...</i>

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.630
<i>or in the planning stages and, of course,</i>
<i>no such weapons have been found.</i>

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:40.840
<i>And so, here you see this sort</i>
<i>of foreshadowing of what's to come...</i>

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:42.220
<i>over the next 15 years.</i>

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.470
<i>This sense of the mythic baddie</i>
<i>that Saddam is.</i>

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.930
...we expect as many as
30,000 casualties the first day.

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.150
<i>And, of course, the big question is.</i>
<i>Who is responsible for creating that myth?</i>

01:10:55.230 --> 01:10:58.110
<i>Whether it's the media or whether</i>
<i>it's from within the Marines.</i>

01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.400
<i>Of course, well, we'll never know.</i>

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:02.110
...by nerve agents such as soman...

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.780
these agents will produce
casualties immediately...

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:08.120
if you do not deploy these
countermeasures fucking ricky-tick.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.290
Why in the fuck, if we've already
taken a set of PB pills...

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:13.290
and just now been issued
the fucking injector?

01:11:13.370 --> 01:11:15.460
Shut the fuck up.
<i>I'm</i> sick of your shit.

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.040
All right, all right, man.
Calm down.

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:19.250
Look, they <i>don't</i> want chemically
dead fighters on CNN.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.500
Just sign it, Kruger.

01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:22.630
-What the fuck is this?
<i>-It's</i> a waiver.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:27.180
<i>And this scene I love very much and wanted</i>
<i>to make sure was in the movie because...</i>

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:32.020
<i>the discussion of how to deal with chemical</i>
<i>attacks and the fear, the collective fear of...</i>

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.650
<i>the way in which they were gonna be able</i>
<i>to deal with the gas, particularly...</i>

01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:39.190
<i>was an obsession of that particular war.</i>

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:43.860
<i>And it led to them taking a lot</i>
<i>of anti-gas drugs that many believe...</i>

01:11:44.190 --> 01:11:47.490
<i>created what was known, and what</i>
<i>is known, as "Gulf War Syndrome".</i>

01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:51.200
<i>Some people will deny that,</i>
<i>and I think a lot of the Marines on our set...</i>

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:53.500
<i>said they took the pills</i>
<i>and they were perfectly fine...</i>

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.410
<i>and that was probably undeniable.</i>

01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:59.170
<i>But I think it's also the case that there</i>
<i>are some people who have suffered from it...</i>

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:03.010
<i>and it was as a direct result of the drugs</i>
<i>that they ingested during that period.</i>

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:06.300
<i>And here, Kruger, I suppose</i>
<i>on some level quite justifiably, is saying...</i>

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.800
<i>"We don't know what these pills are.</i>
<i>We don't know what they do to our bodies.</i>

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.930
<i>"Why are we taking them, suddenly?</i>
<i>Do you know what they are?"</i>

01:12:12.010 --> 01:12:15.810
<i>You know, and he complains about it</i>
<i>and with that memorable line...</i>

01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:19.980
<i>"In a year's time, my arsehole's gonna</i>
<i>turn inside out and start talking to me"...</i>

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:25.400
<i>conveys the concern that they</i>
<i>were taking stuff that they didn't trust.</i>

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:29.870
<i>And, as Jamie turns his back here,</i>
<i>Sykes turns his back...</i>

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:33.870
<i>Kruger spits his out</i>
<i>and Troy takes his out as well.</i>

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.330
Dig your holes with the hands
God gave you.

01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.590
<i>Something has turned in Troy.</i>

01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:46.590
<i>Obviously, he's learnt in the last couple</i>
<i>of days in screen-time...</i>

01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.100
<i>that he's not gonna be able to re-enlist and</i>
<i>so, suddenly, he starts behaving differently.</i>

01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:55.470
<i>He's aggressive towards Kruger after being</i>
<i>so calm for so long and now...</i>

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.980
<i>he launches this tirade against them.</i>

01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:02.400
<i>Saying that surely they must realise</i>
<i>that in this particular war...</i>

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.070
<i>the grunt on the ground</i>
<i>is gonna be left behind.</i>

01:13:05.150 --> 01:13:06.990
...Iook around.
You hear those planes.

01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:09.450
This war is gonna move
too fast for us.

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.570
All right, we can shoot 1,000 yards.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.330
To go that far in <i>Vietnam....</i>

01:13:13.410 --> 01:13:17.410
<i>And I love this because it was both</i>
<i>a demonstration of Troy's state of mind...</i>

01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.870
<i>which is that he is very, very edgy</i>
<i>and they don't know why.</i>

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.380
<i>Of course, in a minute we realise...</i>

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.170
<i>it's because he's not being allowed</i>
<i>to re-enlist...</i>

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.750
<i>and he's the person,</i>
<i>I suppose, who cares about it the most.</i>

01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:28.760
<i>But also because it makes the point...</i>

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.800
<i>that in some way</i>
<i>the whole movie is making...</i>

01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:33.720
<i>that these guys on the ground</i>
<i>were the victims of this war.</i>

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.270
<i>They were the people who suffered</i>
<i>and when they came back...</i>

01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:41.560
<i>they felt that their war memories</i>
<i>didn't even warrant serious consideration...</i>

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.730
<i>because their war</i>
<i>had only lasted four days...</i>

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:48.240
<i>and in the eyes of the public,</i>
<i>it had been a totally one-sided effort.</i>

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.990
<i>The fact that there had been people</i>
<i>out there for nine months...</i>

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:53.530
<i>wasn't something that I realised</i>
<i>until I read the book.</i>

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:56.330
<i>And the argument that somehow</i>
<i>this war was fought in the air...</i>

01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:58.580
<i>by people, who as Cortez says</i>
<i>in this scene...</i>

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:00.540
<i>"Go home and sleep</i>
<i>in their own beds tonight"....</i>

01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.750
<i>That argument hadn't ever occurred to me.</i>

01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:05.960
<i>This is the beginning of a type of war</i>
<i>in which...</i>

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:09.840
<i>the men on the ground are utterly</i>
<i>out of the loop and just not...</i>

01:14:10.130 --> 01:14:13.260
<i>in the midst of the war.</i>
<i>Bear witness to the war more than fight in it.</i>

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.680
I <i>don't</i> need your fucking attitude.

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.470
But <i>that's</i> all he wants,
is to be in the Suck.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.390
I know that,
but the Suck <i>doesn't</i> want him.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.520
He had a criminal record.
He lied about it.

01:14:23.770 --> 01:14:25.810
And he lied about it
on his application.

01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:28.400
<i>We had a long scene that we took out...</i>

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.280
<i>which is the next scene after this one</i>
<i>that you're watching now...</i>

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.370
<i>between Troy and Swoff,</i>
<i>explaining why he couldn't re-enlist...</i>

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.160
<i>because he'd been caught selling drugs.</i>

01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:43.620
<i>And I felt it was too on-the-nose, it was too</i>
<i>explanatory and it was too expositional...</i>

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.000
<i>and that, instead,</i>
<i>it was better to put the information...</i>

01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:48.550
<i>about why he couldn't re-enlist...</i>

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:52.220
<i>very casually in the conversation</i>
<i>between Sykes and Swoff.</i>

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.390
<i>So, we ADR'ed that line.</i>

01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:58.310
<i>After, in post-production,</i>
<i>we dubbed that line of Jamie's...</i>

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:02.180
<i>in which he says, "He's got a criminal</i>
<i>record. He lied about it on his application"...</i>

01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:05.020
<i>so that we wouldn't have to deal with it</i>
<i>in this scene.</i>

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.360
<i>And I kind of felt like we nodded towards...</i>

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:11.240
<i>why he wasn't allowed to re-enlist</i>
<i>in a later scene, when he says...</i>

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.200
<i>"What do you think you're gonna do when</i>
<i>you leave", and Troy says, "I don't know.</i>

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.700
<i>"Sell some crack, sling some dope"...</i>

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:22.040
<i>he says, and so it kind of hints at the fact</i>
<i>that he had that kind of life before.</i>

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.000
<i>And I wanted those hints</i>
<i>and those suggestions...</i>

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:29.250
<i>because I felt that the character was best</i>
<i>when shrouded by a little bit of mystery.</i>

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:34.130
<i>That wasn't just me being bloody-minded</i>
<i>about not giving the audience information.</i>

01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:38.760
<i>It was making sure that when finally</i>
<i>Troy flips and he explodes...</i>

01:15:38.970 --> 01:15:41.560
<i>that it is genuinely shocking and volcanic...</i>

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:45.600
<i>and comes from someone who you utterly</i>
<i>don't expect to express themselves...</i>

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:49.190
<i>or to be able to explain</i>
<i>what is happening in their life.</i>

01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:53.780
<i>And I felt that,</i>
<i>that's where the power of the role lay...</i>

01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:57.320
<i>so I kind of deliberately</i>
<i>stopped him explaining himself...</i>

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.910
<i>and coming out</i>
<i>with philosophical gobbets about...</i>

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.080
<i>what the Marine Corps meant</i>
<i>and what it should be...</i>

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:05.500
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>the history of the Marine Corps.</i>

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:08.210
<i>...'cause</i> we're about to
go in the shit. We're Marines.

01:16:08.290 --> 01:16:11.170
<i>This scene was the one scene</i>
<i>where I stopped in the middle.</i>

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:14.260
<i>And, just, we ground to a halt</i>
<i>for half a day and I stopped...</i>

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:17.340
<i>and we talked about what</i>
<i>the scene should be and re-shot it.</i>

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.560
<i>It was much longer, originally,</i>
<i>and I felt like...</i>

01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.600
<i>it was the moment when the men,</i>
<i>who have all...</i>

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:28.850
<i>separately discussed that Troy is</i>
<i>at a low ebb and can't re-enlist.</i>

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.570
<i>They've all discussed what to do</i>
<i>and they've decided...</i>

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:35.530
<i>that they're going to brand him and it's</i>
<i>Swoff who basically gives them the signal...</i>

01:16:35.610 --> 01:16:37.030
<i>that the moment has come.</i>

01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:39.820
<i>And you hear his voice over</i>
<i>the wide shot here saying...</i>

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:42.620
<i>"Get the brand, get the brand,</i>
<i>now, now, now", he says...</i>

01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:46.210
<i>and before you know it, it's out,</i>
<i>and this is their love letter.</i>

01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:49.420
<i>And what they are saying to him, really,</i>
<i>is that it doesn't matter what happens...</i>

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:50.880
<i>however long you are in the Marine Corps...</i>

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.920
<i>you're a Marine for life, because you are</i>
<i>one of us and you will always be a Marine.</i>

01:16:55.010 --> 01:16:57.840
<i>And there's something</i>
<i>about the brotherhood and the bond...</i>

01:16:57.930 --> 01:17:00.680
<i>that exists between these guys,</i>
<i>particularly when you meet them...</i>

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:04.060
<i>that whatever they go through,</i>
<i>they will always be...</i>

01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.230
<i>a jarhead.</i>

01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:11.060
<i>And that's what the movie says at the end</i>
<i>and what this scene is very clear to say.</i>

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:13.150
<i>And this expression on Peter's face...</i>

01:17:13.230 --> 01:17:16.990
<i>after he gets branded is, I think,</i>
<i>one of the best pieces of acting...</i>

01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:20.860
<i>in any film that I've done, or play, either.</i>

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:23.080
<i>It's just heart-stopping.</i>

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:30.870
We turned the inside of our <i>tent....</i>

01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:36.260
<i>Always, with Peter, I pushed him just</i>
<i>that little further than he expected.</i>

01:17:36.340 --> 01:17:39.300
<i>He felt he'd done it and I said,</i>
<i>"Just give me one more"...</i>

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.890
<i>and this was the last take</i>
<i>and it was pretty special.</i>

01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:44.600
<i>And then we have that voiceover about...</i>

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.980
<i>the inside of their tent being</i>
<i>a circus and then we...</i>

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:50.940
<i>in the style of the film,</i>
<i>in the cutting style of the film, cut very....</i>

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:56.570
<i>In a very jagged fashion to this,</i>
<i>the middle of this incoming-fire sequence.</i>

01:17:56.650 --> 01:18:01.110
<i>It was very deliberate, the sudden changes</i>
<i>of rhythm and shifts of tone in the film...</i>

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.910
<i>and the clashes of one tone with another.</i>

01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.160
<i>Very deliberate on the part of myself</i>
<i>and Walter Murch.</i>

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:12.040
<i>It's kind of like, you want the dissonances</i>
<i>between different styles.</i>

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.750
<i>Between the lyrical, in this case,</i>
<i>and the violent...</i>

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.250
<i>and then suddenly back to the lyrical again.</i>

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.670
<i>Between the comic and the serious.</i>
<i>You want people...</i>

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:24.510
<i>hopefully, laughing one moment</i>
<i>and gasping the next.</i>

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:28.470
<i>This is a shot that took a long time</i>
<i>because we had to...</i>

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:30.230
<i>set a lot of explosions in the background.</i>

01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:32.270
<i>We had to ramp the speed of the camera</i>
<i>as we pushed in.</i>

01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:36.320
<i>We had to go from, I think,</i>
<i>24 frames to, I don't know, 120 frames...</i>

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.190
<i>and go gradually into slow motion</i>
<i>as we got closer to him...</i>

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.570
<i>and watch the sand pouring down on him.</i>

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:45.490
<i>120 frames is the speed that we shot</i>
<i>the rose petals in, in</i> American Beauty.

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:47.160
<i>It's the same speed we shot here.</i>

01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:52.250
<i>And then, suddenly, he's out</i>
<i>of his weird, terrified...</i>

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.130
<i>frozen reverie in which he pisses himself...</i>

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:59.130
<i>and he is thrown back into the middle</i>
<i>of the action again by Sykes...</i>

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:02.630
<i>who is completely practical</i>
<i>and very focussed...</i>

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:04.890
<i>and just wants him</i>
<i>to go and get the battery.</i>

01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:08.720
<i>Again, we stoked this up from the book.</i>

01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:13.440
<i>This run happened in a break in the fire</i>
<i>to Tony Swofford...</i>

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.900
<i>and I made it happen as</i>
<i>the incoming fire was happening.</i>

01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:22.360
<i>It's a movie, and you needed this kind</i>
<i>of visceral thrill at this point...</i>

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:26.070
<i>to remember the danger that they</i>
<i>are under and to just try...</i>

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:30.410
<i>and keep us focussed on the fact</i>
<i>that they can die at any minute.</i>

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:34.580
Do not fucking die!
Do not fucking die!

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:36.880
Do not fucking die!

01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:40.090
Do not fucking die!

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.510
This fucking hole <i>isn't</i> deep enough!

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:52.390
<i>Again, here we are with an improvisation.</i>

01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:54.640
<i>These two guys that came in</i>
<i>in the morning...</i>

01:19:54.730 --> 01:19:57.230
<i>that's John who played Harrigan</i>
<i>in the earlier scene...</i>

01:19:57.310 --> 01:20:02.440
<i>and we improvised the scene</i>
<i>in my trailer, scripted it, narrowed it down...</i>

01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:05.530
<i>edited it and shot it that way</i>
<i>in the afternoon.</i>

01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:10.030
<i>I wanted them to be having an argument.</i>
<i>I wanted it to be overheard, thrown away.</i>

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:14.160
<i>Just something about the absurdities</i>
<i>and people's just raw terror.</i>

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:18.380
<i>Everything is running ahead of Swoff</i>
<i>at this point...</i>

01:20:18.460 --> 01:20:21.460
<i>and then nothing is as he expected, which</i>
<i>is something that's gonna obviously...</i>

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:23.130
<i>continue all the way through.</i>

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.550
<i>He's just there, as all of them were,</i>
<i>a beat after something has happened.</i>

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.300
<i>He goes to get the batteries, he comes back.</i>

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:32.220
<i>They're dead batteries,</i>
<i>but it's too late anyway...</i>

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:33.970
<i>they're already going through the berm.</i>

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:36.350
<i>They think that they're heading</i>
<i>in one direction...</i>

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:38.900
<i>and the planes are heading in one</i>
<i>direction, and then in this scene...</i>

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:43.030
<i>of course, the planes turn round</i>
<i>and face them.</i>

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.760
That was A-10s. Warthogs, baby.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.560
Those things
are fucking tank killers.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.520
-That <i>shit's</i> a fucking monster.
-Yeah, no shit, Fowler.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.480
<i>Off they go</i>
<i>into the wild blue yonder</i>

01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:22.400
<i>Let's</i> go, zoomies!

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.780
<i>Let's</i> drop
that righteous hand of God!

01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.780
Fowler, get back in formation.

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:31.070
-They're about to drop those bombs!
-Fowler, stay in position.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.870
They're gonna drop the hand of God
all over the Iraqis!

01:21:33.950 --> 01:21:36.290
-Fowler, stay in your formation.
-Yeah!

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:42.460
<i>This is my little homage,</i>
<i>this scene to</i> North by Northwest.

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:45.050
<i>The shot of Cary Grant running away</i>
<i>from the biplane...</i>

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:46.760
<i>is something that occurred to me...</i>

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:50.430
<i>as Fowler runs towards us,</i>
<i>pursued by two A-10s.</i>

01:21:53.140 --> 01:21:57.390
<i>This is the beginning of the really</i>
<i>serious work done by ILM on the effects.</i>

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.190
<i>When we shot this,</i>
<i>this scene was surrounded by scrubland...</i>

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:03.900
<i>and shrubs, and what-have-you,</i>
<i>and mountains in the distance.</i>

01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:08.530
<i>And the sense of there being an area over</i>
<i>the next berm...</i>

01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:11.990
<i>which has been bombed, which, of course,</i>
<i>is the highway, way in the distance...</i>

01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:14.240
<i>and the planes,</i>
<i>and the smoke in the atmosphere...</i>

01:22:14.330 --> 01:22:17.580
<i>and the whiteness of the desert,</i>
<i>all of those things were added by ILM.</i>

01:22:18.620 --> 01:22:21.960
<i>Of all the scenes in the movie</i>
<i>that were utterly different to shoot...</i>

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.880
<i>the discrepancy between the shooting</i>
<i>of this scene and the actual scene...</i>

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.550
<i>that's on the screen was the greatest.</i>

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.590
<i>'Cause this was a really boring scene</i>
<i>to shoot...</i>

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.430
<i>with one tiny little airplane flying over.</i>

01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:36.600
<i>And on camera, and onscreen,</i>
<i>it is a much more...</i>

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:38.680
<i>I hope, exciting scene.</i>

01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:41.730
<i>And also, surprising.</i>
<i>And happens much, much faster.</i>

01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:46.320
<i>It took us two days to shoot</i>
<i>a scene that must last maybe a minute.</i>

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:49.570
<i>I deliberately didn't shoot the scene</i>
<i>with seven cameras...</i>

01:22:49.650 --> 01:22:52.280
<i>right up against the explosion.</i>
<i>We shot the explosions on four cameras...</i>

01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:57.740
<i>but from a distance, all from</i>
<i>the point of view of Troy, Sykes and Swoff...</i>

01:22:57.830 --> 01:23:01.370
<i>in their formation. I didn't want it to be</i>
<i>sensationalising in any way.</i>

01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:04.790
<i>I just wanted it to be fast</i>
<i>and simple and brutal.</i>

01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:10.670
<i>And then our guys, our platoon,</i>
<i>is cut adrift...</i>

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.930
<i>just making it over the next berm...</i>

01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:15.760
<i>expecting to receive enemy fire,</i>
<i>or at least to meet the enemy...</i>

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.060
<i>and what they see instead...</i>

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:21.890
<i>is the effects of the last 78 hours</i>
<i>of sustained bombing...</i>

01:23:21.980 --> 01:23:23.770
<i>by the US Air Force...</i>

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:28.020
<i>which I talked about a great deal</i>
<i>in pre-production.</i>

01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:31.360
<i>You know, we did a large amount,</i>
<i>an enormous amount of research...</i>

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.900
<i>and photo research in pre-production</i>
<i>on this movie.</i>

01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:37.700
<i>Very little storyboarding, which is</i>
<i>very unlike what I'd done in the past.</i>

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:40.910
<i>And I went in</i>
<i>with very few pre-planned shots.</i>

01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.460
<i>One thing I was very concerned to do</i>
<i>was talk to people...</i>

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.830
<i>who were there all the time...</i>

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.290
<i>and, indeed,</i>
<i>to surround myself with those people.</i>

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:51.050
<i>And one of the people I talked to</i>
<i>was a member of the US Air Force...</i>

01:23:51.130 --> 01:23:53.420
<i>who flew over the "Highway of Death"...</i>

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:57.220
<i>and explained to me that what</i>
<i>had happened was that they were...</i>

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:00.100
<i>bombing those people</i>
<i>coming out of Kuwait City.</i>

01:24:00.180 --> 01:24:04.100
<i>All four lanes of a two-way highway</i>
<i>were all facing in the same direction...</i>

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.690
<i>that the vehicles were exiting Kuwait City.</i>

01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:10.860
<i>And they bombed the head of the road</i>
<i>and the end of the road...</i>

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:15.110
<i>and they created a log-jam,</i>
<i>a giant traffic jam, if you will...</i>

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:17.910
<i>and they just picked out</i>
<i>all the cars in between.</i>

01:24:17.950 --> 01:24:20.450
<i>So they were firing at sitting targets.</i>

01:24:20.530 --> 01:24:25.040
<i>But such was the obsession, at that stage,</i>
<i>with the scale of Saddam's army...</i>

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:30.250
<i>that they felt that they needed</i>
<i>all of that hardware in the sky...</i>

01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:33.670
<i>and, of course,</i>
<i>they vastly outnumbered them, in the end.</i>

01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:38.510
<i>And they destroyed many innocent people</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:42.720
<i>They were only operating on orders</i>
<i>and they were only given those orders...</i>

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:46.060
<i>I think, because there was a great fear</i>
<i>and a great sense...</i>

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:49.480
<i>as Sykes' character says at the time,</i>
<i>that there would be 30,000 casualties...</i>

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.520
<i>the first day of the war.</i>

01:24:51.610 --> 01:24:54.650
<i>In the event,</i>
<i>there were barely 30 of the US side...</i>

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:59.070
<i>but there were vast numbers</i>
<i>of opposition soldiers and civilians...</i>

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:03.410
<i>killed in those 78 hours,</i>
<i>and this is what they stumble on.</i>

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:09.210
<i>It was an iconic image that really</i>
<i>gripped me when I was watching the war...</i>

01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:11.920
<i>from afar in England, in 1990.</i>

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.840
<i>And looking at these photographs</i>
<i>on the front of the newspaper...</i>

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.800
<i>it felt genuinely shocking,</i>
<i>and I hope that some of that...</i>

01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:25.810
<i>shocking aspect of what happened there</i>
<i>is present in the film.</i>

01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:31.980
<i>It was very odd to create this, to build</i>
<i>corpses and cars and set light to them.</i>

01:25:32.770 --> 01:25:34.730
<i>I think Dennis Gassner,</i>
<i>the production designer...</i>

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:38.610
<i>did an extraordinary job</i>
<i>of creating something that was...</i>

01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:40.450
<i>so desolate and real.</i>

01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:45.540
<i>But I felt that the atmosphere on set</i>
<i>that particular day was unlike any other.</i>

01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:50.790
Fergus, here.

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.460
Thanks.

01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.460
<i>And here you have a little scene...</i>

01:25:57.550 --> 01:26:00.800
<i>which shows Swoff still trying to atone,</i>
<i>on some level.</i>

01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:04.810
Spaghetti marinara.

01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:09.100
<i>And then a line that we improvised...</i>

01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:11.400
<i>about the MREs, Meals Ready-to-Eat...</i>

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:14.770
<i>based on something that Jim Dever,</i>
<i>our wonderful Marine advisor, said to us...</i>

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:18.440
<i>which is that, you know, his favourite MRE</i>
<i>was spaghetti marinara.</i>

01:26:18.530 --> 01:26:20.400
<i>It just always amused me...</i>

01:26:20.490 --> 01:26:22.070
<i>'cause it all tasted the same to me.</i>

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:24.700
<i>They're made to eat</i>
<i>some pretty brutal stuff out there.</i>

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.290
<i>And here we are in this scene...</i>

01:26:26.370 --> 01:26:28.410
<i>that really was the most vivid scene</i>
<i>from the book...</i>

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.420
<i>and, I think, one of the scenes</i>
<i>for which I did the movie.</i>

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.300
<i>The scene in which he goes and sits down</i>
<i>in a circle of dead Iraqis...</i>

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:39.260
<i>who were sitting in a not dissimilar</i>
<i>positions to...</i>

01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:43.010
<i>the positions his friends are sitting in</i>
<i>over the berm.</i>

01:26:44.090 --> 01:26:47.600
<i>We blew this black dust on everything</i>
<i>to replicate explosions.</i>

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:51.350
<i>We had no idea there were going to be</i>
<i>white footprints on the sand...</i>

01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:53.270
<i>which also seems very powerful.</i>

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:56.230
<i>Very clearly indicating that</i>
<i>he is the only person to have....</i>

01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.900
<i>The only living person,</i>
<i>to have entered this circle.</i>

01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:03.320
<i>We were pretty lucky with the weather</i>
<i>and stuff on this movie.</i>

01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:08.080
<i>You know, here you have this</i>
<i>very, very flat, dull, almost dead light...</i>

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:11.540
<i>in this scene, which was just very overcast</i>
<i>on that day and hot...</i>

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:14.880
<i>and it felt really</i>
<i>suffocatingly claustrophobic there.</i>

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:18.050
<i>And it was very, very helpful for the scene.</i>

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:24.470
<i>And then Jake had to do it</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:27.140
<i>Be sick over and over again...</i>

01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:31.560
<i>with a mouthful of vegetable soup,</i>
<i>or whatever it was.</i>

01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:37.770
<i>And we improvised some lines.</i>
<i>This brief line...</i>

01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:42.030
<i>"One hell of a day", is actually something</i>
<i>that was an improvised line as well.</i>

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.080
<i>And then this really crucial moment, I think,</i>
<i>showing as much about...</i>

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.160
<i>Jamie's character</i>
<i>as it does about Swoff's character...</i>

01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:55.420
<i>that Jamie cares about what they're seeing</i>
<i>and what they're going through...</i>

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.710
<i>and is interested, is very important.</i>

01:27:57.790 --> 01:28:01.510
<i>But also, Swoff decides not to talk about it.</i>

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:03.670
-What?
-Oil wells.

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.630
They lit up the oil wells.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.270
<i>Something that Bill Broyles said to me</i>
<i>is that there will always be...</i>

01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:14.690
<i>those things you see in war</i>
<i>that you will never talk about.</i>

01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:16.690
<i>And one of the extraordinary things</i>
<i>about Tony Swofford is...</i>

01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:19.110
<i>he not only talked about it,</i>
<i>he wrote about it.</i>

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:32.620
<i>Here are these oil fires, the beginning</i>
<i>of the oil fires on the horizon...</i>

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:36.170
<i>and everything you see,</i>
<i>with the very rare exception...</i>

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:38.750
<i>of the occasional very close fire...</i>

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.880
<i>is created by ILM, out of nothing.</i>

01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:47.010
<i>The oil rain that hits him on the face</i>
<i>and on the tongue, that's real.</i>

01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:50.300
<i>We made that out of</i>
<i>a molasses-type mixture.</i>

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:52.890
<i>It was pretty vile,</i>
<i>but it wasn't nearly as vile as crude oil...</i>

01:28:52.970 --> 01:28:55.100
<i>which frankly would've been intolerable...</i>

01:28:55.180 --> 01:28:57.900
<i>as I'm sure it was for those guys</i>
<i>when they were there.</i>

01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:01.940
Well, <i>you'd</i> better get used to it,
<i>'cause we're gonna be living in it.</i>

01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:04.860
<i>And you see it splattering on his face here.</i>

01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:08.070
<i>And now you see them</i>
<i>literally knee-deep in it...</i>

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.620
<i>digging their sleeping holes.</i>

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:12.410
<i>They had to dig sleeping holes</i>
<i>in pretty much any environment...</i>

01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:14.830
<i>and put up little canopies over them.</i>

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.540
<i>But here the winds change, and it's blowing</i>
<i>the oil rain down onto them...</i>

01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:22.840
<i>while they're trying to dig their holes,</i>
<i>and Kruger gets it in his eyes.</i>

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.130
<i>But one of the things about this scene...</i>

01:29:25.210 --> 01:29:28.720
<i>is it forms a kind of....</i>
<i>One of the circles of hell...</i>

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:31.010
<i>in the third part of this movie.</i>

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:34.310
<i>I've always thought of these</i>
<i>as concentric circles.</i>

01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:36.350
<i>Gradually descending to the still centre.</i>

01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:39.060
<i>You know, you go through the friendly fire...</i>

01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:41.110
<i>and then you walk down</i>
<i>the "Highway of Death"...</i>

01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:43.440
<i>and then into the circle,</i>
<i>and then you're put into the oil rain...</i>

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.570
<i>and then you're in the scene where Fowler</i>
<i>is mutilating the corpse.</i>

01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:50.030
<i>And right at the centre of this hell...</i>

01:29:50.110 --> 01:29:52.490
<i>is this man, Sykes...</i>

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.370
<i>as he does later,</i>
<i>justifying why they're there and saying...</i>

01:29:57.450 --> 01:30:01.500
<i>how beautiful it is.</i>
<i>Which to me is the true vision of hell.</i>

01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:05.000
<i>Let's</i> go, man. <i>Let's</i> go.

01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:09.010
<i>I always felt that this sequence</i>
<i>was part of that journey...</i>

01:30:09.090 --> 01:30:11.300
<i>deeper and deeper into the darkness.</i>

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:14.100
<i>And as such, again, there is no story.</i>

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:16.520
<i>You don't know where they're heading,</i>
<i>you don't know why.</i>

01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.980
<i>And in a sense, neither do they.</i>
<i>They're just operating on orders.</i>

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:21.900
<i>They're moving across the desert.</i>
<i>Sleeping and moving.</i>

01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.940
<i>But they haven't encountered anything.</i>

01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:27.690
<i>They haven't seen any enemies,</i>
<i>except dead ones...</i>

01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:30.490
<i>and now the fires</i>
<i>are burning all around them.</i>

01:30:30.570 --> 01:30:32.950
<i>So, there's some kind of...</i>

01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:35.490
<i>emotional journey going on.</i>

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:39.000
<i>Some state of mind that is echoed</i>
<i>by the landscape...</i>

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:40.500
<i>and what's happening to it.</i>

01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:43.630
<i>Their sort of mental landscape is aflame,</i>
<i>as well.</i>

01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:45.750
Fowler, what are you doing?

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.300
Fowler!

01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.090
What are you <i>digging....</i>

01:30:49.170 --> 01:30:51.470
<i>And now they spot Fowler</i>
<i>over the next berm...</i>

01:30:51.550 --> 01:30:54.430
<i>and he's doing something</i>
<i>that isn't what he's supposed to be doing...</i>

01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:57.350
<i>and they all have suspicions,</i>
<i>and so they go and check it out.</i>

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.140
<i>This was a scene that was in the book...</i>

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.850
<i>and that wasn't in the original version</i>
<i>of the script...</i>

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:04.900
<i>and I think the studio was a little nervous,</i>
<i>understandably, and by the way...</i>

01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:09.190
<i>I couldn't be more grateful to the studio</i>
<i>for letting us make this film.</i>

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:12.110
<i>It is not an easy film to make.</i>
<i>It's a big film to make.</i>

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:16.120
<i>It's expensive, and it's....</i>
<i>It offers no easy answers, I hope...</i>

01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.450
<i>and it's not told in black-and-white terms.</i>

01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:22.000
<i>And it has some pretty extreme scenes,</i>
<i>this being one of them, you know.</i>

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.170
<i>For any mainstream Hollywood studio now</i>
<i>to spend money on a movie...</i>

01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:28.380
<i>set in the Middle East in any way</i>
<i>is pretty extraordinary...</i>

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:30.260
<i>let alone to have scenes in which...</i>

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:32.930
<i>you see a US Marine mutilating a corpse.</i>

01:31:33.510 --> 01:31:36.510
<i>But, you know, you see,</i>
<i>as hopefully is the case...</i>

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.930
<i>throughout this movie,</i>
<i>both sides of the argument.</i>

01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:42.180
<i>You see the person who's mutilating,</i>
<i>and then the disgust of the people...</i>

01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:45.350
<i>that are his compatriots.</i>
<i>And, in the end, they win out.</i>

01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:49.940
<i>But he has a totally justifiable argument,</i>
<i>in his view...</i>

01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:52.320
<i>which is that he didn't kill him.</i>
<i>He was already dead.</i>

01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.740
<i>So what's he hurting, what's he harming?</i>

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:58.120
<i>And that's a terrifying argument to hear,</i>
<i>I think.</i>

01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:01.290
<i>And, I think, at this point Swoff provides</i>
<i>the moral compass, you know.</i>

01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:03.790
<i>He says there is something wrong</i>
<i>about this...</i>

01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:06.960
<i>and this is unacceptable,</i>
<i>and I'm not gonna explain why.</i>

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.210
<i>I'm just gonna take</i>
<i>the body away and bury it.</i>

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:13.720
<i>But it's very difficult, in these situations,</i>
<i>to keep your moral bearings, I think.</i>

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.220
<i>And I think one of the things</i>
<i>that the movie does...</i>

01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.930
<i>hopefully, is show how it is just possible,</i>
<i>but difficult.</i>

01:32:20.010 --> 01:32:21.770
-...as many as I want.
-You <i>won't</i> get this one.

01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:24.690
<i>Evan auditioned with this scene for Fowler</i>
<i>and did it brilliantly.</i>

01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:26.480
<i>And he does it brilliantly again here.</i>

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.190
<i>'Cause I don't</i> even
fucking want that one!

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:32.030
I don't.

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.530
Fowler...

01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:36.910
<i>And again improvised that line about...</i>

01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:38.990
<i>"I didn't kill him. He's already dead. "</i>

01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:42.620
<i>And improvised this stuff at the end saying,</i>
<i>"You know, I....</i>

01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:45.410
<i>"I don't even really want that one. "</i>

01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:49.920
<i>And then this is a scene</i>
<i>that wasn't in the book...</i>

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.710
<i>that I felt we needed to have in, really...</i>

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:57.430
<i>which was something that indicated</i>
<i>the destruction of the natural world...</i>

01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:00.430
<i>which is what happened</i>
<i>here in the desert.</i>

01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:04.140
<i>The oil killed thousands,</i>
<i>tens of thousands of creatures.</i>

01:33:04.770 --> 01:33:06.940
<i>Horses, cows, camels...</i>

01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:11.110
<i>reptiles, birds, et cetera, et cetera.</i>

01:33:11.190 --> 01:33:14.150
<i>And, in a way, this horse represents...</i>

01:33:14.230 --> 01:33:19.030
<i>the whole of the natural world here.</i>
<i>But it's also a creature that allows...</i>

01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:22.370
<i>some tender moment from Swoff...</i>

01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:27.620
<i>and kind of gives him a moment alone,</i>
<i>which I felt was necessary...</i>

01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.580
<i>at this point in the film,</i>
<i>just to somehow isolate him.</i>

01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:33.630
<i>And allows us to breathe a bit</i>
<i>after that Fowler scene...</i>

01:33:33.710 --> 01:33:34.840
<i>and everything that's been happening...</i>

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.260
<i>all the craziness</i>
<i>that's been happening in the oil fires.</i>

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:42.390
<i>Allows us to just get some distance on it</i>
<i>before the scene with Jamie...</i>

01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.640
<i>as Sykes...</i>

01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:47.270
<i>that begins with this shot.</i>

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:51.150
<i>There is something, I hope, iconic about...</i>

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.020
<i>the image of a man digging a grave...</i>

01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:58.530
<i>in the still centre of this hellish landscape...</i>

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:01.990
<i>and being joined</i>
<i>by his commanding officer...</i>

01:34:02.030 --> 01:34:04.330
<i>who proceeds to tell him</i>
<i>why he'd rather be there...</i>

01:34:04.410 --> 01:34:05.540
<i>than anywhere else in the world.</i>

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:08.460
...pull this type of shit,
but the Marines don't.

01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:13.540
<i>If there was ever an equivalent to</i>
<i>that great moment in</i> Apocalypse Now...

01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.260
<i>where Duvall says, "I love</i>
<i>the smell of napalm in the morning"...</i>

01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:20.430
<i>it's this moment which is him saying...</i>

01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:22.720
<i>"Who else gets to see shit like this?"</i>

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.310
<i>And there are many, many people,</i>
<i>many men out there fighting now...</i>

01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:28.100
<i>who, ultimately, feel the same way...</i>

01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:31.600
<i>and I felt it was very important</i>
<i>to give those people a voice.</i>

01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:34.270
<i>You know, on the one hand,</i>
<i>you've got Swoff staring at him...</i>

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.400
<i>and looking at him as if he's a total lunatic...</i>

01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:40.450
<i>and on the other hand,</i>
<i>you have a very, very sane rationalisation...</i>

01:34:40.530 --> 01:34:42.700
<i>of why he's there and why he loves it.</i>

01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:45.580
<i>And I think that in microcosm</i>
<i>there is the debate...</i>

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:47.700
<i>and there is the argument,</i>
<i>and it's up to the audience...</i>

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:49.410
<i>to pick their way through it.</i>

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.420
<i>In a way, a lot of the meaning of the scene</i>
<i>is carried in Jake's reactions...</i>

01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.340
<i>which are very subtle, I think.</i>

01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.510
<i>And most important of all,</i>
<i>his reaction at the very end...</i>

01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:03.970
<i>when Sykes looks out at the oil fires</i>
<i>and he carries on staring...</i>

01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:08.220
<i>at this person he takes to be a lunatic...</i>

01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:11.100
<i>and yet, who makes total sense.</i>

01:35:11.190 --> 01:35:13.810
<i>So, I suppose all the scariest lunatics</i>
<i>make total sense.</i>

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:16.940
Do you know why I don't?

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.780
Because I love this job.

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:33.750
I thank God for every fucking day
that He gives me in the Corps.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.330
Ooh-rah.

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.260
I mean, who else gets a chance
to see shit like this?

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:56.940
<i>Here is this big wide shot,</i>
<i>again created by ILM.</i>

01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:01.280
<i>If you can believe it,</i>
<i>all the night-time desert oil well scenes...</i>

01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.200
<i>starting with the previous scene with Fowler</i>
<i>and ending with this...</i>

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.620
<i>were shot on Stage 22 at Universal Studios.</i>

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.540
<i>These are interior scenes shot on a stage...</i>

01:36:10.620 --> 01:36:14.710
<i>and when we walked into the stage,</i>
<i>it looked like a blasted...</i>

01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:17.080
<i>empty desert landscape.</i>

01:36:17.170 --> 01:36:19.170
<i>One of the strangest sets</i>
<i>I've ever walked onto...</i>

01:36:19.420 --> 01:36:21.630
<i>with an enormous bank of lights above...</i>

01:36:21.710 --> 01:36:23.970
<i>and here you can see those lights</i>
<i>coming into play...</i>

01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:27.340
<i>as dawn breaks over the desert,</i>
<i>and they're given their final mission...</i>

01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:29.760
<i>which is to.... Well, they don't know</i>
<i>it's their final mission...</i>

01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:34.690
<i>but it is their final mission</i>
<i>to go and report to the Colonel.</i>

01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.320
<i>Here's a line that was in the book</i>
<i>that I loved...</i>

01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.860
<i>"Don't thank me, just don't fucking die. "</i>

01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:43.030
Thank you.

01:36:43.110 --> 01:36:45.450
<i>Don't</i> thank me,
just <i>don't</i> fucking die.

01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:46.860
<i>Let's</i> go.

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:51.200
<i>Sykes is a very brilliant composite</i>
<i>of many, many lines and characters...</i>

01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:55.040
<i>from the book,</i>
<i>as indeed are many of the other men.</i>

01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:58.170
<i>Because, although Tony writes brilliantly</i>
<i>about himself in the book...</i>

01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:02.840
<i>he fails to go into great detail</i>
<i>about any of the other guys...</i>

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.090
<i>and that was Bill Broyles'job,</i>
<i>and he fulfilled it brilliantly...</i>

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:09.800
<i>and then the actors</i>
<i>added the next dimension to it.</i>

01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:12.430
<i>And here we see</i>
<i>this kind of important shot...</i>

01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:15.310
<i>that takes them</i>
<i>out of the burning oil fields...</i>

01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:17.730
<i>and moves them into the daylight again.</i>

01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:21.480
<i>Although, they're still wiping off</i>
<i>the oil from...</i>

01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.940
<i>their faces and hands and what-have-you.</i>

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.240
-Sykes thinks you boys are good.
-Yes, sir.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.790
<i>And then we're back to Chris Cooper</i>
<i>who is giving their final briefing...</i>

01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:36.580
<i>and suddenly they feel like....</i>
<i>You can see the two of them feel...</i>

01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.670
<i>kind of excited and awed...</i>

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:43.590
<i>and totally focussed</i>
<i>about what they're going to do.</i>

01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:48.840
<i>And, I suppose, this begins the process</i>
<i>of the biggest, kind of...</i>

01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:52.850
<i>rug-pulling exercise</i>
<i>that the movie attempts...</i>

01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:54.600
<i>which is to put the audience...</i>

01:37:54.680 --> 01:37:58.190
<i>in the shoes of two men</i>
<i>who have been trained to kill...</i>

01:37:58.270 --> 01:38:01.900
<i>and, whatever their political views...</i>

01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:06.820
<i>liberal or not liberal,</i>
<i>to be willing them into shooting someone.</i>

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:08.900
Before you take a shot,
you must get clearance.

01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:12.570
<i>And then realise what they've been asking</i>
<i>of their central characters.</i>

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.080
Some of my <i>officers....</i>

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.830
<i>This journey that they go on...</i>

01:38:16.910 --> 01:38:19.370
<i>this build-up,</i>
<i>really begins with this briefing...</i>

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:22.040
<i>and this fantastic bit of music transition...</i>

01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:24.840
<i>that happens at the end of this line</i>
<i>that takes them up the berm.</i>

01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.550
...fucking show me.

01:38:33.010 --> 01:38:37.100
<i>Again, ILM created the background here...</i>

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:41.560
<i>the factory and what's beyond Swoff...</i>

01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:43.060
<i>as he looks now.</i>

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:45.520
<i>That was an empty berm</i>
<i>and they created the long shot...</i>

01:38:45.610 --> 01:38:46.940
<i>of the observation tower.</i>

01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:49.240
<i>And again here</i>
<i>we were in a bluescreen studio...</i>

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.820
<i>in Universal, the Universal backlot.</i>

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:55.530
<i>This is not a real location.</i>
<i>Neither is the interior.</i>

01:38:57.790 --> 01:39:00.410
<i>I think had we not come to this</i>
<i>pretty much in sequence...</i>

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:04.500
<i>towards the end of the shoot,</i>
<i>I think it would've felt ridiculously fake.</i>

01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:05.880
<i>But by the time we got here...</i>

01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.470
<i>the reality between</i>
<i>Jake and Peter was so great...</i>

01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:12.680
<i>and the sense</i>
<i>that this was the climactic scene...</i>

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:16.720
<i>they could've acted it anywhere,</i>
<i>they were so ready to do it.</i>

01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:21.270
<i>I approached Peter before we did this scene,</i>
<i>and I said, as I often do...</i>

01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:23.980
<i>to actors who have big scenes,</i>
<i>"How would you like to shoot it?</i>

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:27.270
<i>"Do you want to do it in pieces?</i>
<i>Do you want to do the intense bit...</i>

01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.780
<i>"in other words, the last bit, first?</i>
<i>Do you want to do the whole thing as one?</i>

01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:32.530
<i>"How do you wanna do it?" And he said...</i>

01:39:32.610 --> 01:39:34.110
<i>"I'll do the whole thing as one.</i>

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:36.660
<i>"From the moment</i>
<i>they start looking at the observation tower...</i>

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:38.830
<i>"to the very end of the scene...</i>

01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:41.210
<i>"and then we'll do it</i>
<i>as many times as you need. "</i>

01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:44.210
<i>And so that's what we did.</i>
<i>We did the whole scene beginning to end...</i>

01:39:44.290 --> 01:39:48.000
<i>over and over again,</i>
<i>so that Peter would always have a run-up...</i>

01:39:48.090 --> 01:39:50.800
<i>into the tension he was experiencing...</i>

01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:54.130
<i>and the sense of disappointment</i>
<i>that he wasn't getting the shot...</i>

01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:57.890
<i>and then the imploring and the pleading</i>
<i>that he goes through with the Major...</i>

01:39:57.970 --> 01:40:02.850
<i>and then his final breakdown,</i>
<i>which I think is an amazing piece of acting...</i>

01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:06.020
<i>to totally make yourself vulnerable like that.</i>

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.900
<i>And here we deliberately go....</i>

01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:14.110
<i>We iris down on the scene</i>
<i>with listening to tiny noises...</i>

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:19.410
<i>to the sound of Swoff's cheek</i>
<i>scraping against the butt of the rifle...</i>

01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:24.460
<i>to the sound of the clicking of the scope,</i>
<i>to the catch being flicked here.</i>

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:30.460
<i>The tiniest breath, the tiniest noise.</i>
<i>Everything in extreme close-up...</i>

01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:33.800
<i>which is not something that I'd used</i>
<i>up to this point in the movie.</i>

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:38.640
<i>Racking back and forth</i>
<i>between the tower and the sniper scope.</i>

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.180
<i>And I love this particular shot</i>
<i>of Troy's hand shaking...</i>

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:45.270
<i>as he holds the receiver</i>
<i>ready to get the news...</i>

01:40:45.350 --> 01:40:47.860
<i>that he's got the clearance to make the shot.</i>

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.190
<i>And the quieter it gets and the stiller it gets,</i>
<i>the more and more tension builds...</i>

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.240
<i>until the moment the Major walks in</i>
<i>and blows it all apart...</i>

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.410
<i>in a big wide shot...</i>

01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:02.290
<i>and then the scene changes direction</i>
<i>suddenly and very dramatically.</i>

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:03.870
Fire.

01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:05.960
Fire.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.830
Fire.

01:41:09.210 --> 01:41:11.500
-What the fuck frequency are you on?
<i>-Oh....</i>

01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:13.960
<i>This was something</i>
<i>that I loved from the book...</i>

01:41:14.050 --> 01:41:15.880
<i>was the lines that Dennis Haysbert has here.</i>

01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:19.260
<i>"Bad knees. College football",</i>
<i>when one of his right-hand men there...</i>

01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:21.720
<i>flips up a deck chair for him.</i>

01:41:22.770 --> 01:41:25.980
Bad knees. College football.

01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:28.350
<i>It's kind of like a man at the races...</i>

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.070
<i>or a man sitting down</i>
<i>for a slap-up meal, or something.</i>

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.820
<i>You can't believe really</i>
<i>what he's looking forward to...</i>

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:38.200
<i>is calling in an air strike that's gonna kill</i>
<i>three or four hundred men.</i>

01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:39.950
<i>And another favourite line is...</i>

01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:43.240
<i>"You never know how many chances</i>
<i>you're gonna get to do this. "</i>

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:47.960
<i>"You can't take my chance away. "
And every bit as much as Troy wants to...</i>

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:51.880
<i>take out the officer,</i>
<i>the Major wants to take out everyone.</i>

01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:56.010
We have permission
from the Colonel, sir.

01:41:56.090 --> 01:41:57.510
Hitman 45. <i>Hitman....</i>

01:41:57.590 --> 01:42:01.680
<i>This whole scene was suggested</i>
<i>almost entirely by Walter Murch...</i>

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.720
<i>once we had the idea</i>
<i>that the Major took away the kill.</i>

01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:08.690
<i>In the first draft, Troy just gave up</i>
<i>and said, "Okay, fine. "</i>

01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:12.480
<i>And Walter said,</i>
<i>"Well, why doesn't he argue with him?</i>

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.820
<i>"Why doesn't he try and justify it?</i>
<i>Why don't they have a fight?"</i>

01:42:15.900 --> 01:42:18.530
<i>And everything emerged from that one note.</i>

01:42:18.900 --> 01:42:20.990
<i>And it was a brilliant note that Walter gave...</i>

01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:23.200
<i>and he is such</i>
<i>an extraordinary man, Walter...</i>

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.000
<i>that he's capable of giving notes</i>
<i>about every aspect of the film.</i>

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:29.120
<i>Very much like Conrad Hall,</i>
<i>who shot my first two movies.</i>

01:42:29.210 --> 01:42:33.960
<i>He's elevated the position that he finds</i>
<i>himself in of editor and sound editor...</i>

01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:36.090
<i>to something closer to an art.</i>

01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:41.890
<i>And here's Peter's breakdown scene of Troy.</i>

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.890
<i>Again, in every take,</i>
<i>he said something different.</i>

01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:49.350
<i>And what he's trying to say,</i>
<i>although it's very difficult to make out...</i>

01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:52.400
<i>towards the end, is,</i>
<i>"I was just trying to explain. "</i>

01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:55.400
<i>Which breaks my heart. I don't know why.</i>

01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:00.320
<i>One of the things I asked Peter to do</i>
<i>towards the end of the take...</i>

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.030
<i>was to turn himself away.</i>

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:05.700
<i>I think he's very humiliated</i>
<i>about what he's put himself through.</i>

01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.160
<i>And what has been seen</i>
<i>by the Major and by Swoff...</i>

01:43:08.250 --> 01:43:10.580
<i>and so he turns himself away</i>
<i>to face the wall...</i>

01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:13.170
<i>and covers his face like a child.</i>

01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:23.510
Hitman 45. Hitman 45.
This is Bravo 4 Lima. Over.

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.850
<i>And here we are with the air strike</i>
<i>that the Major has called in.</i>

01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.190
<i>Again, almost entirely a CGI shot...</i>

01:43:34.270 --> 01:43:38.360
<i>with a miniature airport being blown up</i>
<i>in the background.</i>

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.860
<i>This all shot on the bluescreen stage</i>
<i>at Universal, as I said.</i>

01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:47.490
<i>And there's very few things</i>
<i>that link my three movies...</i>

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.540
<i>because I feel particularly this one is</i>
<i>quite different from the other two...</i>

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:52.040
<i>but, in all three movies, you'll find...</i>

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:56.710
<i>shots of characters</i>
<i>being divorced from their reality...</i>

01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:59.550
<i>by a window,</i>
<i>and the reflections in the window.</i>

01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:03.880
<i>And then we're into this scene,</i>
<i>which, again, was much longer...</i>

01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:06.800
<i>and I cut down in editing process.</i>

01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:10.680
<i>A final conversation, as it turns out to be,</i>
<i>between Troy and Swoff.</i>

01:44:10.770 --> 01:44:13.600
<i>One of those things</i>
<i>that they'll probably look back on...</i>

01:44:13.690 --> 01:44:15.730
<i>when they get home and remember.</i>

01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:21.030
<i>And it's some little indication</i>
<i>of what Troy did...</i>

01:44:21.110 --> 01:44:24.740
<i>to stop him being able to re-enlist,</i>
<i>which is the drug comment.</i>

01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:28.780
You got any ideas?

01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:33.620
I'll sell some crack.
Sling some dope.

01:44:35.290 --> 01:44:39.420
<i>And I felt like there was a need here</i>
<i>for some brief touching moment...</i>

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.050
<i>between the two of them in which...</i>

01:44:41.130 --> 01:44:44.430
<i>ultimately Swoff really expressed that</i>
<i>that was it for him.</i>

01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:46.800
<i>He wasn't going to come back</i>
<i>into the Corps...</i>

01:44:46.890 --> 01:44:49.350
<i>and that what he had seen was enough.</i>

01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:51.180
<i>But that, you know, Troy...</i>

01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:54.350
<i>is the person who should be staying,</i>
<i>and he's not allowed to...</i>

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:56.520
<i>which is the ultimate irony.</i>

01:44:56.850 --> 01:44:59.480
<i>And then they realise</i>
<i>that they've missed their pick-up...</i>

01:44:59.570 --> 01:45:02.940
<i>and they're suddenly cut adrift</i>
<i>in the middle of the empty desert.</i>

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:06.240
<i>And we shot this next scene here</i>
<i>in Yuma, Arizona...</i>

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:08.950
<i>on the most amazing, dramatic dunes.</i>

01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:11.540
<i>One of the pieces of luck we had...</i>

01:45:11.620 --> 01:45:14.710
<i>was that the tyre marks</i>
<i>from all the dune buggies...</i>

01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:17.000
<i>that go up and down on those dunes</i>
<i>on a daily basis...</i>

01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:19.500
<i>were blown away by this extraordinary wind.</i>

01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:21.880
<i>And we were, in fact,</i>
<i>shooting in a sandstorm.</i>

01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:24.130
<i>This was a pretty brutal evening,</i>
<i>but it was one night...</i>

01:45:24.210 --> 01:45:26.510
<i>and it was really worth it,</i>
<i>because the landscape...</i>

01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:28.840
<i>as it looks here,</i>
<i>and as lit by Roger Deakins...</i>

01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:31.470
<i>is just extraordinary...</i>

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.640
<i>and it really did look like this.</i>

01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:37.770
Fucking Scuds, man.

01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:41.150
<i>Obviously, those oil fires in the background</i>
<i>are computer-generated...</i>

01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:44.150
<i>but the lighting banks</i>
<i>that were lighting the desert were there.</i>

01:45:44.230 --> 01:45:45.570
<i>The way Roger did it, by the way...</i>

01:45:45.650 --> 01:45:49.030
<i>was to put huge banks</i>
<i>of flickering lights up...</i>

01:45:49.110 --> 01:45:53.330
<i>wherever we wanted an oil fire,</i>
<i>and then we replaced those banks...</i>

01:45:53.410 --> 01:45:55.330
<i>with oil fires in post...</i>

01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:58.460
<i>but, of course,</i>
<i>the light was there when we shot.</i>

01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.300
<i>This is largely ADR, this sense of danger</i>
<i>and impending doom over the berm.</i>

01:46:04.420 --> 01:46:07.260
<i>The sense that the screams</i>
<i>are the screams of people being tortured...</i>

01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:09.090
<i>and that these are two heads</i>
<i>impaled on poles...</i>

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:13.640
<i>rather than what they actually are,</i>
<i>in fact, which is two Marine covers.</i>

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.100
<i>Helmets put on e-tools.</i>

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:20.940
<i>And instead of the scenes of torture</i>
<i>and destruction that they expect...</i>

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:26.190
<i>what they see is the end of the war</i>
<i>and the party celebrating that.</i>

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.240
<i>I wanted this to have</i>
<i>a kind of nightmarish feel.</i>

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:30.740
<i>This feeling like...</i>

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:33.870
<i>you know, you come home</i>
<i>expecting your house to be empty...</i>

01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:36.370
<i>and closed up, and someone's having</i>
<i>a party in your house.</i>

01:46:36.450 --> 01:46:40.960
<i>Not only a party, but it's in the final stages</i>
<i>and people are really high.</i>

01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:43.000
Having a little party.
You're a little overdressed.

01:46:43.090 --> 01:46:47.340
<i>And Sykes is totally abandoned here.</i>
<i>I love what Jamie does in this scene.</i>

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:52.430
<i>Suddenly, there's this guy who's been</i>
<i>pushing them around all movie...</i>

01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.720
<i>and now he's just another guy partying.</i>

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:01.020
<i>Again, a suggestion of Walter Murch's</i>
<i>that Lucas Black here...</i>

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.520
<i>says, "Did you get a kill?"</i>
<i>and Swoff has to say, "No. "</i>

01:47:03.610 --> 01:47:05.820
-No.
-Oh, shit.

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:08.070
<i>That sort of embarrassment</i>
<i>immediately afterwards...</i>

01:47:08.150 --> 01:47:10.400
<i>that they haven't done</i>
<i>what they were supposed to do.</i>

01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:12.610
We're going home!

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:15.700
<i>And then Evan Jones</i>
<i>burning his desert camies.</i>

01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:19.960
<i>This was very important for me, this scene,</i>
<i>that they all felt at the time that, that was it.</i>

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.830
<i>That Saddam was dead and deposed.</i>

01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.170
<i>That they would never have to come back,</i>
<i>as Fergus says in this shot...</i>

01:47:25.250 --> 01:47:27.210
<i>"To this shit hole ever again!"</i>

01:47:27.300 --> 01:47:31.800
<i>And, of course, we know now</i>
<i>that that was not the case.</i>

01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:38.770
<i>And this moment when Swoff realises</i>
<i>the war is over and he never fired his rifle...</i>

01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:41.390
<i>and that sets off</i>
<i>a chain of events with them...</i>

01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:44.940
<i>unloading the barrels of their weapons</i>
<i>into the night sky...</i>

01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.520
<i>which is a scene, again, from the book...</i>

01:47:46.610 --> 01:47:49.780
<i>and there was something</i>
<i>kind of ritualistic and wild about this.</i>

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:52.950
<i>The release of tension</i>
<i>of all those months of waiting...</i>

01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:56.530
<i>and the inability to act</i>
<i>and their own impotence...</i>

01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:59.910
<i>and the sense in which</i>
<i>they were the victims of this war.</i>

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:04.830
<i>There's an expression here...</i>

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.670
<i>of, kind of, solidarity and desperation,</i>
<i>depending on who you're looking at...</i>

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.260
<i>which I felt was really powerful.</i>
<i>And for a long while...</i>

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.970
<i>this is almost how</i>
<i>I wanted the movie to end.</i>

01:48:16.050 --> 01:48:17.850
<i>And then we thought about it,</i>
<i>and we thought...</i>

01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:22.430
<i>"No, it needs some contextualising,</i>
<i>in a way. You can't just end it here. "</i>

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.850
<i>And we had various different voiceovers</i>
<i>playing over this.</i>

01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:29.020
<i>But in the script form,</i>
<i>we decided that we were going to...</i>

01:48:29.110 --> 01:48:30.280
<i>go back home with them...</i>

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.280
<i>and witness the scene</i>
<i>that Tony Swofford remembers...</i>

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.870
<i>when they're on the bus at the end</i>
<i>and a Vietnam Vet steps on.</i>

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:40.950
<i>This was a pretty intense scene,</i>
<i>'cause they were firing guns...</i>

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:44.420
<i>and it was very, very loud.</i>
<i>So everyone was struggling.</i>

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.840
<i>It was very, very cold that particular night.</i>

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:49.880
<i>People were getting to the end</i>
<i>of their tether...</i>

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:52.880
<i>which happened on a fairly regular basis</i>
<i>on this movie.</i>

01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:57.850
<i>And you can sort of see it in their faces</i>
<i>which I kind of loved, again...</i>

01:48:57.930 --> 01:49:01.060
<i>because that's exactly</i>
<i>what they are in the movie, too.</i>

01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:03.810
That was my war.

01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:12.280
<i>And then we go back to El Centro,</i>
<i>to shoot this scene of them returning home.</i>

01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:13.740
<i>They're home now,</i>
<i>and in their Marine buses.</i>

01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:19.990
<i>Their friendly, but rather sad,</i>
<i>welcome-home parade...</i>

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.910
<i>and the can of beer, and stuff.</i>

01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:25.410
<i>There was a real sense of, you know,</i>
<i>that they all got home safely at the time...</i>

01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:29.250
<i>and a sense of celebration and delight</i>
<i>and relief, I think, more than anything else...</i>

01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:31.460
<i>that there had been</i>
<i>so few civilian casualties....</i>

01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:33.130
<i>So few military casualties.</i>

01:49:33.210 --> 01:49:35.220
<i>But there was also</i>
<i>a sense of disappointment...</i>

01:49:35.300 --> 01:49:38.090
<i>that they didn't come home</i>
<i>with the war stories that they wanted...</i>

01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:41.180
<i>and the combat action ribbons</i>
<i>that they might've prayed for.</i>

01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:46.520
<i>And then this,</i>
<i>this scene with the Vietnam Vet.</i>

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.360
<i>And he came on the bus, V.J., who</i>
<i>played the Vietnam Vet, who was superb.</i>

01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.980
You did it.

01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.400
<i>And he kind of took everyone</i>
<i>a bit by surprise...</i>

01:49:54.490 --> 01:49:57.740
<i>and that shot of Jamie staring at him</i>
<i>is very much....</i>

01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:01.450
<i>Was what Jamie's expression</i>
<i>was on the day.</i>

01:50:01.870 --> 01:50:06.000
<i>And I told V.J. to shake their hands</i>
<i>and they all looked a bit shocked.</i>

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.620
<i>It was exactly what was required.</i>

01:50:09.540 --> 01:50:12.630
<i>But this image of this wreck, really...</i>

01:50:12.710 --> 01:50:15.420
<i>who's still, even now...</i>

01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:19.840
<i>proud of having been in the Corps,</i>
<i>and giving them an "ooh-rah" at the end.</i>

01:50:19.930 --> 01:50:24.520
<i>This was what effectively</i>
<i>felt like the end of the picture...</i>

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:27.230
<i>and everything else</i>
<i>was really about what happened next.</i>

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:32.270
<i>And we cut and re-cut this sequence</i>
<i>over and over...</i>

01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.020
<i>dealing with</i>
<i>whether to have voice-over here...</i>

01:50:34.110 --> 01:50:37.400
<i>whether to have score here,</i>
<i>whether to let the Tom Waits play.</i>

01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:41.660
<i>In the end, I wanted something that was...</i>

01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.740
<i>a single coda that felt like one piece.</i>

01:50:44.830 --> 01:50:48.080
<i>And I wanted the audience to understand</i>
<i>that the movie was coming to an end...</i>

01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:51.630
<i>and to experience this as the last images</i>
<i>they would have of the characters.</i>

01:50:51.710 --> 01:50:53.250
<i>Some of them going back into civilian life...</i>

01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:56.590
<i>some of them remaining Marines,</i>
<i>and not always the people that you expect.</i>

01:50:56.670 --> 01:50:59.680
<i>Some doing well, some doing badly.</i>

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.220
<i>It also gave our wonderful costume designer</i>
<i>Albert Wolsky...</i>

01:51:02.300 --> 01:51:05.010
<i>a chance to actually put some clothes</i>
<i>on them, as opposed to...</i>

01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:06.970
<i>what he's had to do</i>
<i>throughout the entire movie...</i>

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:09.140
<i>which is dress them in uniforms.</i>

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.490
Hey, where you going?

01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:24.620
<i>This very sad shot of Escobar</i>
<i>stacking Coke cans...</i>

01:51:24.700 --> 01:51:27.080
<i>and, of course,</i>
<i>I don't know whether it is sad or not...</i>

01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:29.000
<i>to see Sykes still there...</i>

01:51:29.370 --> 01:51:33.210
<i>in a different set of camies</i>
<i>with a different weapon in his hands...</i>

01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:37.630
<i>fighting still in Sniper Alley,</i>
<i>somewhere in the Middle East.</i>

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:41.970
<i>And then the return of Fergus</i>
<i>to Swoff's house, you see time has passed.</i>

01:51:42.050 --> 01:51:45.510
<i>Swoff's grown his hair, so has Fergus.</i>
<i>They've both left...</i>

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.220
<i>and then this line when he says,</i>
<i>"I've got some bad news. "</i>

01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:51.690
<i>And you think, "Oh, no. " And Troy is dead.</i>

01:51:51.770 --> 01:51:54.810
<i>Now, a lot of people have asked me,</i>
<i>"Well, how did Troy die?"</i>

01:51:54.900 --> 01:51:58.230
<i>And the truth is in the book he dies</i>
<i>because he flips his car on black ice...</i>

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:01.950
<i>coming home from what Tony describes</i>
<i>as his "dead-end civilian job. "</i>

01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:05.280
<i>But I liked taking out the description</i>
<i>of why and how he died...</i>

01:52:05.370 --> 01:52:08.740
<i>because I felt there was a mystery attached</i>
<i>to the character throughout the movie...</i>

01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:10.700
<i>and that mystery should continue</i>
<i>through to the end.</i>

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:14.000
<i>And I feel like we're always</i>
<i>answering questions in films...</i>

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:18.300
<i>and answering questions in entertainment,</i>
<i>and sometimes it's nice to ask them...</i>

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.170
<i>and to leave a little bit of mystery attached...</i>

01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:24.470
<i>because there would always be a question</i>
<i>of whether Troy killed himself or not...</i>

01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:28.180
<i>and I loved leaving that door open.</i>
<i>And I still do.</i>

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:48.240
<i>And then we go right at the end to</i>
<i>Swoff in his den...</i>

01:52:48.330 --> 01:52:50.950
<i>with the current conflict playing on the TV</i>
<i>in the background.</i>

01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:52.960
<i>For a while,</i>
<i>we had a shot of George Bush here...</i>

01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:55.920
<i>but I felt that limited it</i>
<i>just to this historical period...</i>

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.710
<i>and I want this movie to mean the same</i>
<i>in 10, 20 years as it does now.</i>

01:52:59.800 --> 01:53:03.670
<i>And I daresay we'll be at war somewhere,</i>
<i>I'm sad to say.</i>

01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:05.840
...build a <i>house....</i>

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.890
<i>Then this final shot</i>
<i>with this final voiceover.</i>

01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:15.230
<i>This sense that there are no explanations,</i>
<i>there is no message...</i>

01:53:15.310 --> 01:53:19.520
<i>there is no judgement,</i>
<i>but there is understanding.</i>

01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:23.190
<i>Greater understanding</i>
<i>of what he went through.</i>

01:53:24.190 --> 01:53:27.240
<i>And also a bond that will always be there.</i>

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.070
<i>Not only with the people</i>
<i>that he fought with...</i>

01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:31.700
<i>but the people that are fighting there now...</i>

01:53:31.790 --> 01:53:35.210
<i>as I speak, who are, just as he says...</i>

01:53:35.290 --> 01:53:38.250
<i>at the end of this movie, "Still in the desert".</i>

01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:41.590
<i>And this, of course, is a shot of six people</i>
<i>that we know...</i>

01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:44.300
<i>having seen them in the movie</i>
<i>in this exact same shot...</i>

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:48.800
<i>but at the same time, it's six faceless</i>
<i>Marines who could be there now...</i>

01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:52.260
<i>and I felt that was a very appropriate way</i>
<i>of ending the film.</i>

01:53:59.150 --> 01:54:02.610
<i>And then we go into the end credits</i>
<i>and the music playing...</i>

01:54:02.690 --> 01:54:06.450
<i>is the instrumental version</i>
<i>of</i> Jesus Walks <i>by Kanye West...</i>

01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:08.950
<i>which is a track</i>
<i>that we used over the trailer...</i>

01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:11.280
<i>which kind of weirdly became associated</i>
<i>with the film...</i>

01:54:11.370 --> 01:54:13.160
<i>before it came out, and I thought....</i>

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:16.870
<i>Well, I think it's an incredible piece</i>
<i>and I wanted to use it.</i>

01:54:21.460 --> 01:54:25.300
<i>The temptation with this movie...</i>

01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:27.220
<i>particularly towards the end...</i>

01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:31.350
<i>was to add my own point of view...</i>

01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:36.180
<i>about the current political situation</i>
<i>while we were making this movie...</i>

01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:38.600
<i>in Iraq which is that I felt very strongly...</i>

01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:41.860
<i>that we shouldn't be there,</i>
<i>and the war shouldn't be continuing.</i>

01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:44.730
<i>But in the end,</i>
<i>after much debate and thought...</i>

01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:49.610
<i>I felt that it was inappropriate</i>
<i>in a movie about...</i>

01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:53.450
<i>the Gulf War in '91, to give the characters</i>
<i>the benefit of foresight...</i>

01:54:53.530 --> 01:54:55.330
<i>as to what would happen next.</i>

01:54:55.410 --> 01:54:59.370
<i>And I wanted to leave the audience</i>
<i>to draw their own conclusions.</i>

01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:01.670
<i>So, in many ways, for me...</i>

01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:05.380
<i>the great strength of the film...</i>

01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.720
<i>is its ambivalence about the future...</i>

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:11.970
<i>and its unwillingness to make a comment...</i>

01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:15.390
<i>about the current political situation</i>
<i>at the time the movie was released.</i>

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.310
<i>And I hope in years to come...</i>

01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.940
<i>that 10 years down the line,</i>
<i>15 years down the line...</i>

01:55:21.150 --> 01:55:23.770
<i>the movie means as much, if not more...</i>

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:25.690
<i>than it did when it was first released...</i>

01:55:25.770 --> 01:55:29.280
<i>because it isn't limited</i>
<i>by being a specific polemic...</i>

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:34.030
<i>against the current Presidential incumbent.</i>

01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:40.830
<i>And that's it.</i>
<i>I hope you enjoyed the commentary.</i>

01:55:40.910 --> 01:55:43.250
<i>I hope you enjoyed the movie.</i>

01:55:43.460 --> 01:55:47.590
<i>Obviously, if you're listening to this,</i>
<i>you can't have hated it, but maybe you did.</i>

01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:52.760
<i>I hope that more movies</i>
<i>like this movie get made.</i>

01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:54.930
<i>Not war movies specifically,</i>
<i>but movies that are...</i>

01:55:55.010 --> 01:55:57.560
<i>specifically engaged with political issues...</i>

01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.270
<i>and engaged in them in the current climate.</i>

01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:02.310
<i>Because I think it's important</i>
<i>that people go and see them...</i>

01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:04.360
<i>and people continue to make them.</i>

01:56:05.360 --> 01:56:09.070
<i>So thank you very much for watching,</i>
<i>and thank you for listening, too.</i>
