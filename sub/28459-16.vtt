36:02.200 --> 36:05.033
Don't you ever
go after my ----ing husband!

36:05.066 --> 36:06.700
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

36:06.734 --> 36:10.066
- This is for your grandchild.
- Oh, thank you.

36:10.100 --> 36:13.600
I brought the bunny, because
I never gave it to my grandson,

36:13.633 --> 36:18.500
because it didn't feel like it
had good energy. I'm sorry.

36:19.734 --> 36:23.734
She didn't need to be crude
and rude and disrespectful.

36:25.233 --> 36:27.000
- That's Erika speaking.

36:27.033 --> 36:29.266
- Erika does not do that.

36:29.300 --> 36:31.633
I don't recall Erika being
quite like that.

36:31.667 --> 36:34.133
- I feel very attacked again
by her.

36:34.166 --> 36:38.700
I'm not even hearing anything
but "See you next Tuesday."

36:38.734 --> 36:40.500
- Okay.
Oh, my goodness gracious.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.200
- Are you kidding?
- That was super awkward.

36:44.667 --> 36:46.567
That was really weird.
Okay, that was weird.

36:49.734 --> 36:52.567
- Giving Lisa Rinna
that bunny was really (BLEEP)!

36:52.600 --> 36:54.333
- Okay.
Oh, my goodness gracious.

36:54.367 --> 36:56.700
- Are you kidding?
- That was super awkward.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.367
That was really weird.
Okay, that was weird. Not good.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.300
- That was so fun.
- That was really unbelievable.

37:05.333 --> 37:10.100
- I like being Erika. It's fun.
- That was wrong.

37:10.133 --> 37:11.600
Was that not wrong?

37:11.633 --> 37:13.233
- Yeah.

37:13.266 --> 37:16.667
- You guys, what's happening?
- Kim feels upset.

37:16.700 --> 37:19.667
- Well, that was uncalled for.
That was very uncalled for.

37:19.700 --> 37:24.266
- I feel it was inappropriate,
and it was rude, and it's--

37:24.300 --> 37:26.133
- It's over.

37:26.166 --> 37:28.300
- Is she holding a grudge?
- 100%.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.166
Lisa always acts like this

37:30.200 --> 37:31.700
because she's always
looking for attention.

37:31.734 --> 37:34.166
That's Lisa.
That's Lisa Rinna.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.200
Don't try to blame
beautiful Erika Jayne

37:37.233 --> 37:39.300
for Lisa Rinna's behavior.

37:39.333 --> 37:41.233
Eh-eh. Eh.

37:41.266 --> 37:44.033
When is somebody gonna grow up?
And obviously it's not her,

37:44.066 --> 37:46.667
running around in Erika Jayne's
ponytails tonight.

37:46.700 --> 37:48.166
- Well, I think
she looks great.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.400
I would love to wear
Erika Jayne's ponytails.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.033
I wish I thought
of that costume.

37:51.066 --> 37:52.066
- But then she needs
to at least--well,

37:52.100 --> 37:53.300
that's beside the point.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.700
- Well, then make it
beside the point.

37:54.734 --> 37:56.133
- I am making the point.
The point--

37:56.166 --> 37:58.300
- Why is she talking
about her costume?

37:58.333 --> 38:00.000
- Because she was rude to me,
Denise.

38:00.033 --> 38:01.667
- But that has nothing to do
about her costume.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.233
Lisa is one of
my best friends,

38:03.266 --> 38:05.400
so we've obviously talked
about Kim Richards

38:05.433 --> 38:07.700
and that situation,
and it really hurt her.

38:09.433 --> 38:11.166
- I'm gonna walk away
for just a second,

38:11.200 --> 38:13.200
'cause this just
doesn't feel quite right.

38:13.233 --> 38:15.200
- I don't think
it's cool at all.

38:15.233 --> 38:17.000
- Isn't it a ----ing
stuffed animal

38:17.033 --> 38:18.633
that we're talking about?

38:19.367 --> 38:21.266
And you know what?
It really hurt her feelings.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.700
- That is a lie.
- It's not a lie.

38:23.734 --> 38:27.200
It's not a ----ing lie, Kim.
It hurt her feelings.

38:27.233 --> 38:29.300
- Well, I don't believe that.

38:29.333 --> 38:32.166
Have you ever thought
about my feelings, Denise?

38:32.200 --> 38:36.300
Were you talked about for years
and years? She's disrespectful.

38:36.333 --> 38:39.333
Denise should just stand back
and mind her own business,

38:39.367 --> 38:41.333
because it really
is between Lisa and I.

38:41.367 --> 38:45.200
- Let it ----ing go.
- What? Me let it go?

38:45.233 --> 38:47.100
- Was it the best thing to say?

38:47.133 --> 38:49.767
No, but it's not anything
to annihilate her.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.066
- She's not annihilating.
She's not wrong though.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.400
So give her that,
because she's not wrong.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.233
Regardless, it doesn't
make sense what she did.

38:56.266 --> 38:57.633
That wasn't okay.

38:57.667 --> 38:58.767
- I'm sorry your feelings
are hurt.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.200
- My feelings aren't hurt.

39:00.233 --> 39:02.166
- Then what's the problem?

39:03.700 --> 39:05.033
- Okay.

39:05.066 --> 39:06.467
I don't think you get it.
Okay.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.100
- We're done. We're done. Bye.

39:09.133 --> 39:11.233
- They need to
let it ----ing go.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.300
Who cares about some fuzzy
----ing bunny?

Well, let me tell you

about some ----ing

39:50.734 --> 39:52.367
stuffed animal,
a goddamn bunny.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.400
- Kim has very strong
feelings about it.

39:54.433 --> 39:56.133
And so does Kyle.
- Does she? Oh.

39:56.166 --> 40:00.000
- And I think Teddi,
because she walked away too.

40:00.033 --> 40:02.433
- It's been two years
of unresolved energy.

40:02.467 --> 40:06.266
- You told Eden
that I am near death,

40:06.300 --> 40:10.200
that I am not in a good place.
This is so treacherous.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.467

40:11.500 --> 40:13.767
that I have only wanted
to move on with you.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.000
- I wish that it was different
between the two of you.

40:17.033 --> 40:18.533
- And the truth is giving Rinna

40:18.567 --> 40:20.400
back that bunny
was really (BLEEP).

40:20.433 --> 40:22.300
I'm sorry.

Wait, wait, wait. Can I--

40:45.066 --> 40:46.266
- Okay. All right.

a moment alone.

I think you look beautiful.

I have definitely
been over the top

41:10.367 --> 41:12.767
and in character tonight,
I will say that.

41:13.000 --> 41:14.767
- All right. All right.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.467
Do you want to say
you're sorry?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.500
- Well, you've still never
apologized to me

41:19.533 --> 41:21.200
for that moment.

41:21.233 --> 41:23.066
- But what about you
apologizing to me?

41:23.100 --> 41:27.166
- I have. I used to have
a nice relationship with you.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.400
- Yes.

41:28.433 --> 41:32.200
- So I would be happy
to go back to that.

41:32.233 --> 41:34.066
- But then you have
to be nice, Lisa.

41:34.100 --> 41:35.333
- Well, I know, Kim.

41:35.367 --> 41:37.066
You know,
that wasn't appropriate.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.233
I agree. But also what you did
was not appropriate,

41:40.266 --> 41:41.767
and you've never
apologized for it.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.367
- Wait, wait, wait,

41:43.400 --> 41:46.000
because there was such
bad stuff between us.

41:46.033 --> 41:48.500
I couldn't find it in me.

41:48.533 --> 41:51.333
- I mean, I get it.
I can see your side of that.

41:51.367 --> 41:54.600
- The bunny represented lots
of mean things said,

41:54.633 --> 41:56.567
lots of damage done.

41:56.600 --> 42:00.200
I really didn't feel it was
wrong when I gave it back.

42:00.233 --> 42:02.600
Honestly, I was very hurt

42:02.633 --> 42:06.333
by a lot of things
she did and said.

42:06.367 --> 42:08.200
Sorry.

42:08.233 --> 42:10.300
- You know, I really took me
off-guard to be honest, and--

42:10.333 --> 42:11.467
- To see me?

42:11.500 --> 42:13.300
- I was scared to see you,
I think.

42:14.467 --> 42:18.233
I was scared to see you.
- I'm so sorry.

42:18.266 --> 42:19.767
- And I reacted that way.

42:20.000 --> 42:24.100
That's not--that's not
who I am, so.

42:24.133 --> 42:27.066
Giving me the bunny back
was by far the most hurt

42:27.100 --> 42:28.633
I've ever been in this group.

42:28.667 --> 42:31.400
- I don't really know what's
real and what's not with you.

42:33.467 --> 42:36.266
- (BLEEP).
It was like a gut punch.

42:36.300 --> 42:37.600
It just really hurt me.

42:37.633 --> 42:40.000
I'm sorry for whatever
has happened between us.

42:40.033 --> 42:41.467
How about that?
I'll say that to you right now.

42:41.500 --> 42:45.033
- Me too.
- Can we move on?

42:46.133 --> 42:50.333
- Let's just forgive
each other, right?

42:52.600 --> 42:54.467
- And I'm just glad
that we're having

42:54.500 --> 42:57.567
this conversation
under this, like, dead angel.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.133
Maybe that's a sign.

42:59.166 --> 43:02.400
- Let's see how long
we can do this.

43:02.433 --> 43:04.567
- Let's try to make it
for a while, okay?

43:06.233 --> 43:08.433
- Wow.
- Miracles happen.

43:08.467 --> 43:10.200
See, you never know.
- Yeah.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.600
- Next on "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:14.633 --> 43:16.600
- Can you get me a double?

43:16.633 --> 43:18.433
- Two glasses?
- In one.

43:18.467 --> 43:21.100
If you bring me
two glasses, I will kill you.

43:21.133 --> 43:22.300
- Okay.
- Here, cheers.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.600
- Cheers, bitch.
- Cheers, bitch.

43:24.633 --> 43:26.266
- I don't like the way

43:26.300 --> 43:28.467
that Teddi has been
acting towards me.

43:28.500 --> 43:32.100
She's just gotten a little big
for her britches.

43:33.567 --> 43:36.066
- Hello?

43:36.100 --> 43:37.567
about going on our girls' trip?

43:37.600 --> 43:41.600

43:44.500 --> 43:46.367
- That's where
we're gonna stay.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.700
- So is Camille invited?

43:47.734 --> 43:49.467
- Of course.
We're gonna meet her in France.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.333
- Denise, how are you?

43:51.367 --> 43:54.200
- The fire is literally
on PCH.

43:54.233 --> 43:56.266
I think our house
might be burning down.

43:56.300 --> 43:57.600
