00:10.611 --> 00:13.747
Where the hell is Clara? Ray?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.716
Ray, where the hell
is Clara? She's up next!

00:15.816 --> 00:18.419
Nobody's seen her,
boss. I-I don't...
Oh, God.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.155
You. I'm desperate here.
Can you fill in tonight?

00:21.255 --> 00:22.956
Oh, me? In the spotlight?

00:23.057 --> 00:24.725
I don't know.
Fine. How about you?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.427
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. My turn.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.162
Sorry, Sally.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.331
Up next, Clara Brown
and the Uptown Gals!

00:32.733 --> 00:34.635
Good evening, Harlem.

00:34.735 --> 00:37.571
Unfortunately,
Clara couldn't make it. Huh.

00:37.671 --> 00:39.773
But I'm Alberta Haynes,

00:39.873 --> 00:41.842
and I'll be taking care
of y'all tonight.

<i>Later that day,</i>

01:31.725 --> 01:33.026
Lauren entered her apartment.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.429
Meanwhile, her sister's dead
body was lying

01:35.529 --> 01:36.830
in the adjacent room.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.699
It's the husband, right?
He's got to be the killer.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.134
Pete thinks it was the husband.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.269
No way.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.370
Says the husband.

01:42.470 --> 01:43.671
Hey, what's shaking?

01:43.771 --> 01:45.506
We're listening to a podcast.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.341
Ooh. What's a podcast?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.809
A podcast is like a...

01:48.909 --> 01:50.544
like a TV show
but without the pictures.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.180
Baby, that's called radio.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.947
What you're describing is radio.

01:54.047 --> 01:56.284
This delves into the murder
of a woman named Hailey,

01:56.384 --> 02:00.288
which is especially sad because
all Haileys are crazy hot.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.789
Sam,

02:01.889 --> 02:03.457
you should do a podcast
about Alberta's murder.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.293
Pete, that's a great idea.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.794
Always thinking of you.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.362
I mean, not always.
I have other interests, too.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.632
Not that you're an interest.
Would someone else please talk?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.501
The ghosts think
that I should start a podcast

02:13.601 --> 02:14.835
about Alberta's murder.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.471
A murder pod
where you have access

02:17.571 --> 02:19.407
to the actual victim?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.175
I love it.
Yes!

02:21.275 --> 02:23.143
Plus, it could be drum up
publicity for the B and B.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.879
You know what? I could pitch it
to the <i>Ulster County Review.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:27.114
They do podcasts.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.582
Oh, speaking of podcasts,
can we finish

02:28.682 --> 02:30.518
listening to this one?
Nice segue.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.152
Little did Hailey know

02:32.253 --> 02:35.356
that would be her last trip
to the Pilates studio.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.090
A Hailey who did Pilates.

02:37.191 --> 02:39.960
This story just got
even more tragic.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.699
<i>Now, be sure to mention
I was a famous singer.</i>

02:45.799 --> 02:49.036
Yes, obviously, Alberta.
That's all part of the pitch.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.471
Ooh, I can't believe

02:50.571 --> 02:51.839
I'm gonna be on a podcast!

02:51.939 --> 02:53.040
Whatever that is.
Okay, bye.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.608
Excuse me.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.077
But how many times must
I bring up the washing machine?

02:57.177 --> 03:00.514
It continues to make a racket
that has ruined my slumber.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.915
Yeah. I know. It's broken.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.451
Jay said he called about it
this morning.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.753
Jay lying.
He play video games all morning.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.120
The one with the red little

03:07.221 --> 03:09.590
Italy man and his green
little Italy brother.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.024
Seriously?

03:11.124 --> 03:12.493
Thor! Don't be a rat.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.195
In the world I come from,
there was nothing worse.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.165
Yeah, we did some shady stuff,
but we had a code.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.133
A code you did not break.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.936
It's what inspired my hit song
"Don't Be a Rat."

03:23.036 --> 03:27.841
♪ Hey, they'll flip on you
just like that ♪

03:27.941 --> 03:30.644
♪ There's nothin' worse

03:30.744 --> 03:34.415
No! Last time you sing,
song got stuck

03:34.515 --> 03:36.149
in Thorfinn's head
for many moons!

03:36.250 --> 03:39.253
Okay, whatever.
The point is, there's nothing

03:39.353 --> 03:40.654
lower than a rat.

03:40.754 --> 03:44.024
What about ground
rat walk on? Yes!

03:44.124 --> 03:45.959
Thor win mind fight.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.030
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

03:50.130 --> 03:52.800
Well, I mean, murder,
mobsters, jazz.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.368
You got everything.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.069
And this Alberta-- she seems
like a big personality.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.405
Oh, yeah.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.206
She can be a lot.

03:59.307 --> 04:02.109
Could... be a lot, is what
I've uncovered from my research.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.211
And she died in the house
that you're currently living in?

04:04.312 --> 04:05.546
I mean, that's a hook!

04:05.646 --> 04:07.648
Right?
I think it could be great.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.683
So, do you have an expert
lined up?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.486
Well, I'm sort of
an Alberta expert myself.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.488
No, no, no, no.
You need an expert.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.923
You're the journalist.
You need a cohost

04:16.023 --> 04:17.758
you can talk to
about the subject.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.493
Ooh. How about this guy?

04:19.593 --> 04:22.663
Todd?

04:22.763 --> 04:24.465
It's Alberta's toenail.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.767
Why?
Maybe I could one day

04:26.867 --> 04:29.770
make an Alberta
from just a little bit of nail.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.172
What is wrong with you, Todd?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.074
"Todd Pearlman, curator

04:34.174 --> 04:36.410
of the Alberta Haynes Museum
in Altoona, Pennsylvania."

04:36.510 --> 04:40.080
Yeah. Uh, the thing is,
I've actually met him.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.149
Wow, you know him?
That's fantastic.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.951
Oh, my God. He has
over 100,000 followers.

04:44.051 --> 04:46.354
That's a built-in audience
right there.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.121
Yeah, but how
do I put this?

04:48.221 --> 04:50.524
He's... a little off.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.394
He's got, like, a-a giant tattoo
of Alberta's face on his back.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.195
The guy's kind of a stalker.

04:55.295 --> 05:00.233
Sam, someone who stalks a dead
person is called a historian.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.869
He's weird, Lewis.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.472
I don't know how else
to say this. He's very weird.

05:04.572 --> 05:08.108
Look, at the end of the day,
this podcast is your baby.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.344
But if you want to do it
at the <i>Ulster County Review,</i>

05:10.444 --> 05:12.179
then I will leave you
with this.

05:12.279 --> 05:15.916
No Todd, no pod.

05:20.754 --> 05:24.124
You shut up!
You shut up right now!

05:24.224 --> 05:25.593
Oh, hey, Hetty.

05:25.693 --> 05:28.328
You yelling at the washing
machine? That's cool.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.231
This vile contraption
will not let me nap.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.900
How is this progress?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.068
In my day,
the washer never made a peep.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.105
In fact, I'm not sure I ever
heard Helen say anything at all.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.210
Oh, thank God!

05:43.310 --> 05:45.713
Oh, Jay, I know
you can't hear me,

05:45.813 --> 05:47.080
but thank you very much indeed.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.650
No, Jay!

05:49.750 --> 05:51.084
No!

05:51.184 --> 05:53.621
Come back and
push the button.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.790
You know, there is an upside

05:56.890 --> 05:58.659
to a broken washing machine.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.794
What could possibly be good

06:00.894 --> 06:02.696
about this deafening
monstrosity?

06:02.796 --> 06:04.565
Sit on it.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.834
Sit on it?
Yes.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.702
Why would I ever do
something like that?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.203
Just trust me.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.139
Fine, I will indulge you

06:12.239 --> 06:14.141
if for no other
reason than to end

06:14.241 --> 06:16.844
this conversation.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.752
Oh, my.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.355
I'll leave you two alone.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.492
:
Oh...

06:31.592 --> 06:33.827
Ah...

06:35.295 --> 06:37.898
Oh...

06:38.699 --> 06:39.633
Oh.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.435
So...

06:41.535 --> 06:42.870
how'd the meeting go?

06:42.970 --> 06:44.805
Well, he really liked the idea.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.540
That's incredible!
Yes!

06:46.640 --> 06:48.308
He did have one thought, though.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.578
He suggested
that I have a cohost.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.079
And more specifically...

06:52.179 --> 06:55.282
that that cohost be
Todd Pearlman.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.950
What?!

06:57.050 --> 06:58.452
You mean Creepy Todd?

06:58.552 --> 06:59.920
My psychopath
stalker?

07:00.020 --> 07:02.222
Oh, the freak that collects
Alberta's toenails.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.190
He was sort of emphatic.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.292
He said, "No Todd, no pod."

07:05.392 --> 07:07.861
And you said, "No
pod," right, Sam?

07:07.961 --> 07:09.497
Look at me.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.764
Tell me you said,
"No pod."

07:10.864 --> 07:13.166
Why won't she make
eye contact with me?

07:13.266 --> 07:16.003
Well, I...

07:16.804 --> 07:18.271
Oh, no.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.374
I got here as fast as I could.

07:21.475 --> 07:25.012
Oh, Sam, what did you do?

07:31.384 --> 07:33.621
I brought you
a little gift in honor

07:33.721 --> 07:35.155
of the official opening
of the B and B.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.624
That is sweet.

07:36.724 --> 07:39.192
Sweet? It's probably
one of my baby teeth.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.829
Oh, yay, this guy.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.664
Here you go.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.365
Oh.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.801
It's your self-published book

07:47.901 --> 07:50.504
on Alberta.
I really enjoyed doing it.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.439
I'm thinking
about writing other things.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.341
Manifestos,
ransom notes.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.209
I actually have a bunch
of stuff from the museum

07:56.309 --> 07:57.978
out in my car. Right.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.380
The museum he runs
from his mother's garage.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.983
Research, files, artifacts.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.385
I thought they would be
useful for the podcast.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.287
Mm-mm, thank you,
no pod, no Todd.

08:07.387 --> 08:09.456
We're not doing no
podcast no more, Sam.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.091
Great. Jay and I will
help you bring it in.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.127
Thanks, I had to clear a bunch
of space in the garage anyway,

08:14.227 --> 08:16.196
because my mom's
boyfriend Kyle needed

08:16.296 --> 08:18.532
a place to store
his bowling stuff.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.068
It's like each word is
sadder than the last.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.238
I can't believe this.
Creepy Todd back in my life.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.640
Alberta?

08:26.740 --> 08:29.509
Bertie, sweetie, you've
just got to relax.

08:29.610 --> 08:31.612
Excuse me?
It's all good.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.480
Hetty, are you ill?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.948
Can we, can we get ill?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.685
Well, if you're referring
to my relaxed demeanor,

08:37.785 --> 08:39.720
it may have
something to do

08:39.820 --> 08:41.622
with a magical encounter
I had recently

08:41.722 --> 08:43.557
with the washing machine.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.092
What happened
with the washing machine?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.327
No one knows, Peter, it's simply

08:47.427 --> 08:49.329
one of the magical mysteries
of the universe.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.398
Wait.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.133
Hetty, do you really not know

08:53.233 --> 08:55.068
what was happening
on the washing machine?

08:55.168 --> 08:58.906
Not a clue.
It was making you aroused.

08:59.006 --> 08:59.940
Oh, yes.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.108
Sexually.
What?!

09:01.208 --> 09:03.110
Mm-hmm.
Oh...

09:03.210 --> 09:05.345
Well...

09:05.445 --> 09:07.247
I will certainly...

09:07.347 --> 09:09.282
not be doing that again.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.785
Please, please look away.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.421
What's this old piece
of furniture?

09:14.521 --> 09:16.657
Oh, be careful.
That, my friend,

09:16.757 --> 09:18.425
is an end table that belonged

09:18.525 --> 09:20.460
to Alberta herself. Oh.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.662
Wow, is this a picture

09:21.762 --> 09:23.363
of Alberta
when she was a little girl?

09:23.463 --> 09:25.132
Oh, that's actually
a thing I did online

09:25.232 --> 09:28.401
where I put her and my pictures
together and it shows

09:28.501 --> 09:30.003
what our kid
would look like.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.439
Sam, I beg you,
stop asking questions.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.441
Pretty cute.

09:34.541 --> 09:35.676
Holy crap,
that's my table.

09:35.776 --> 09:37.845
There's a false bottom.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.847
Sam, you tell him to stop
messing with that right now.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.448
Maybe we shouldn't
mess with that.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.450
You know, just 'cause
it's an antique.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.186
What is that?
Some kind of old book.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.155
That's nothing.
Don't look at that!

09:48.255 --> 09:49.422
Oh, my God!

09:49.522 --> 09:51.358
It's Alberta's diary.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.961
Whoa.
Twist of plot.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.395
Diaries are personal,

09:55.495 --> 09:56.864
so keep
your looky-loo hands off it.

09:56.964 --> 10:00.267
Maybe we should just
respect Alberta's privacy.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.669
Are you joking?

10:01.769 --> 10:03.203
What are we even
doing this podcast

10:03.303 --> 10:05.038
for, if not to take advantage

10:05.138 --> 10:06.539
of something like this?

10:06.640 --> 10:08.909
What a find!

10:09.009 --> 10:11.144
Sam, you have
to get that back.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.380
There's something in there
that can't get out.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.884
Alberta says there's something
in there that can't get out.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.052
Come on, what could be that
bad? She's always bragging

10:19.152 --> 10:21.421
about hiding bodies
and bootlegging.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.891
All that stuff's nothing
compared to this.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.893
So what is it?
What's in the diary?

10:25.993 --> 10:28.762
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.497
I mean, now I definitely
want to know.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.499
Yeah.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.769
Come on, Hetty, you can do this.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.771
Clean thoughts, clean thoughts.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.741
Clean, clean, clean... laundry,

10:40.841 --> 10:43.711
washing machine. Damn it.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.480
Has he gotten
to the juicy part yet?

10:47.580 --> 10:50.150
No. Todd's kind
of a slow reader.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.419
We finished this page
two minutes ago, Todd.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.487
Let's go.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.089
Wait.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.158
Should we be feeling
a slight moral quandary

10:58.258 --> 11:00.427
about delving into Alberta's
personal writings?

11:00.527 --> 11:02.763
I mean, diaries are
supposed to be...

11:02.863 --> 11:04.164
private.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.100
On the other hand...
Yes?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.769
Todd is going to find out

11:08.869 --> 11:11.338
whatever secret it is
she doesn't want us to know.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.741
At which point Alberta will
no doubt need our support.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.675
So in a way it'll be better

11:15.776 --> 11:17.377
that we're up to speed.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.346
So we should
keep snooping.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.648
For Alberta.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.486
Oh, my God, I think
he's turning the page.
Yes, yes, yes!

11:26.586 --> 11:28.155
Oh, thank God.
Do it, do it, do it!

11:30.557 --> 11:31.859
No!
Damn it, Todd!

11:31.959 --> 11:33.426
Come on!
Come on, man, come on!

11:33.526 --> 11:35.562
You wrote a book, read one!
Please!

11:37.030 --> 11:39.800
Alberta's really torn up about
this whole diary thing, Jay.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.802
Look, I can try to
take it from him,

11:41.902 --> 11:43.804
but I don't think the Hulk
could pry it from Todd's hands.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.906
It's, like, his
Ark of the Covenant.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.708
His what?
<i>Raiders of the Lost Ark!</i>

11:48.809 --> 11:50.911
Would you just die already
so we can be best friends?

11:51.011 --> 11:52.679
Look, I'm sorry
for what happened.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.147
But, honestly,
we're all gonna find out.

11:54.247 --> 11:57.017
So maybe you should just tell us
in your own words.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.819
Oh, fine.

11:58.919 --> 12:01.221
Remember the story
of how I got my big break?

12:01.321 --> 12:03.757
A real underdog story.
I love underdogs.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.793
Not that I'm saying I love you.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.095
W-Would someone else talk, please?

12:08.195 --> 12:09.729
The headliner Clara Brown
didn't show,

12:09.830 --> 12:11.899
so they asked me
to perform in her place.

12:11.999 --> 12:15.302
What I never told y'all
was the real reason

12:15.402 --> 12:17.304
Clara was a no-show that night.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.507
It was 'cause she got arrested
and spent a night in jail.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.542
And the reason she was arrested

12:22.642 --> 12:24.377
was because...

12:24.477 --> 12:26.079
I ratted her out.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.682
You want to tell me what that
gasp means or wait till later?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.151
Later.
Okay.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.786
Catch up then.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.289
Oh! I'm a rat, y'all!

12:36.389 --> 12:37.690
A rat!

12:37.791 --> 12:39.960
♪ Nothin' worse ♪

12:40.060 --> 12:43.330
♪ Than a low-down rat. ♪

12:43.430 --> 12:44.932
Sorry.

12:50.938 --> 12:51.972
What's all the commotion?

12:52.072 --> 12:53.240
Did I miss a gasp?

12:53.340 --> 12:55.242
Alberta is rat,
which is ironic

12:55.342 --> 12:57.644
because she give Thor trouble
about being rat earlier.

12:57.744 --> 13:00.881
Irony he gets,
yet cars are still landships.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.449
This is all your fault, Sam.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.651
If you hadn't brought Todd back,
no one would have found

13:04.751 --> 13:07.354
the diary and none of this
would be happening.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.056
Okay, no,
I-I played a role in it.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.624
But, honestly, wasn't the
podcast, like, Pete's idea?

13:11.724 --> 13:13.560
It's kind of all his fault.
What are you doing, Sam?

13:13.660 --> 13:15.528
And just so you know,
Pete agrees with me...

13:15.628 --> 13:16.496
Girl!

13:16.596 --> 13:18.365
I forgot you could see him.

13:18.465 --> 13:21.101
Now the whole world's gonna
find out I'm a fraud.

13:21.201 --> 13:22.535
All my fans.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.172
Let down by their one true god.

13:25.272 --> 13:27.674
Even in despair,
she retains a healthy ego.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.743
Alberta, you're looking at this
through the lens of your era.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.946
I don't think people
will be as bothered

13:33.046 --> 13:34.547
by this as you worry they are.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.683
So you don't think my fans
will think less of me?

13:36.783 --> 13:38.585
Your fans love you.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.988
One little incident's
not gonna change anything.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.290
Oh, my God!

13:43.390 --> 13:45.192
This is not gonna
be super helpful.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.027
Alberta was a rat.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.695
I mean, Todd,

13:48.795 --> 13:50.964
not that I am familiar yet
with what you're talking about,

13:51.064 --> 13:53.300
but, honestly, I'm sure
it wasn't, like, a big deal.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.868
No big deal?

13:54.968 --> 13:57.837
She went against the entire code
that she lived by.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.340
I've dedicated
my entire adult life

14:00.440 --> 14:02.642
to the study
and appreciation of this woman.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.244
But now...

14:04.344 --> 14:06.379
I'm not even sure
I know who she is.

14:06.479 --> 14:07.847
Oh, my God.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.350
I've lost Todd.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.886
<i>Uh, Flower?</i>

14:12.986 --> 14:15.088
I have something

14:15.188 --> 14:17.557
that I am ashamed

14:17.657 --> 14:19.927
to admit, but I feel I must.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.896
A short time ago, I succumbed

14:22.996 --> 14:25.432
to my demons and I sat

14:25.532 --> 14:27.334
on the washing machine again.

14:27.434 --> 14:29.970
Hetty, it's... it's okay.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.838
No, it's not okay.

14:31.939 --> 14:33.406
It's weak, it's immoral.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.108
It's your body, isn't it?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.643
I mean, you're in charge
of it, right?

14:36.743 --> 14:38.745
You mean since my
husband passed away?

14:38.845 --> 14:39.779
No!

14:39.879 --> 14:42.682
Since always, man!

14:42.782 --> 14:46.019
Look, being ashamed
of female pleasure

14:46.119 --> 14:48.455
was just some BS thing
that men

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
thought up
to control women.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.792
There is nothing wrong

14:52.892 --> 14:54.427
with feeling good, Hetty.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.930
And you don't need
a man's permission.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.001
But we still need men

15:01.101 --> 15:03.971
to design and manufacture
the washing machines.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.239
No, women can do that, too.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.275
Heavens to Betsy!

15:09.409 --> 15:11.244
Oh, what a time to be alive.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.481
I mean, you know
what I mean.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.119
Hey, Alberta, we just, uh,
wanted to come check on you.

15:19.219 --> 15:23.156
Don't you see,
if Todd reacted that way,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.492
then everyone
who listens to the podcast

15:25.592 --> 15:28.361
is gonna turn against me.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.797
And they'd be right to.
Wait, if ratting out Clara was

15:30.897 --> 15:32.532
so against everything
you believed in,

15:32.632 --> 15:34.734
then why'd you do it?

15:35.735 --> 15:38.771
Things weren't easy
for a woman my size back then.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.374
Sure, we had
Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith,

15:41.474 --> 15:43.110
but that didn't mean
that was

15:43.210 --> 15:44.911
what the club owners
were looking for.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.849
And I was tired
of being overlooked.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.653
♪ Nobody knows you
when you're down ♪

15:53.753 --> 15:58.058
♪ And out, I mean,
when you're down and out. ♪

15:58.158 --> 16:00.227
All right.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.628
The gig is yours.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.265
Oh, yes!
The Alberta era has begun.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.267
Not you. Her.

16:07.367 --> 16:09.036
Her?

16:09.136 --> 16:11.004
Well, look at her.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.705
She's a star, baby.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.475
I guess you just don't have
what I do, hon.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.313
I agreed to stay on as
one of Clara's backup singers,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.582
hoping someday
my talent would win out.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.952
For two years, I watched onstage

16:26.053 --> 16:29.256
as someone less deserving lived
my dream right in front of me.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.923
That must have been so hard.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.259
It was.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.194
One day I decided...

16:34.294 --> 16:35.862
I wasn't gonna take it no more.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.864
I knew Clara dabbled
in bootlegging.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.300
Mostly 'cause I dabbled
in bootlegging.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.902
And so I dropped a dime on her.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.004
And became a rat.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.307
Alberta, you were
in a really unfair situation.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.510
And, honestly, that Clara chick
kind of sounds like she sucks.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.580
Smug little floozie
couldn't even hit a high C.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.782
Oh, from my barbershop
quartet days

16:55.882 --> 16:57.750
I recognize that
as quite the burn.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.220
You know that that story

17:00.320 --> 17:03.123
makes what you did completely
understandable, right?

17:03.223 --> 17:04.724
And why didn't you
tell us before?

17:04.824 --> 17:07.227
'Cause it's not easy
for me to be...

17:07.327 --> 17:08.795
vulnerable.

17:08.895 --> 17:12.499
I mean, people see me
as this super-confident diva.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.502
But the truth is,
that's an armor I wear.

17:15.602 --> 17:18.105
I struggle like everyone else.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.572
But I don't let that show.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.142
I need to be
my loudest fan.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.244
'Cause God knows there's
always been plenty of folks

17:24.344 --> 17:26.946
trying to tear me down.
Okay, I didn't even think

17:27.046 --> 17:29.516
this was possible, but this
makes me love you even more.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.151
Agreed.
Yep.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.685
Seriously?

17:32.785 --> 17:34.354
And I'm pretty sure
your fans would think so, too.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.490
I mean, jazz legend who has
insecurities just like me?

17:37.590 --> 17:40.227
I'm on board.
Stars-- they're just like us.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.329
You're saying
this makes me relatable?

17:42.429 --> 17:44.897
Oh, yeah.
Like that Jason Momoa spread

17:44.997 --> 17:46.933
in that magazine where
he's shopping for shoelaces?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.102
You're saying
I'm the female Momoa?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.837
Oh, yeah, we're saying it.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.341
Oh, what the hell?
Sam, you fire up that podcast.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.942
We got a public to inspire.

17:56.042 --> 17:59.045
I'm coming for you,
regular joes.

17:59.146 --> 18:02.882
Alberta's gonna inject some
hope into your dreary lives.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.752
Is she going too far?
Let her have it.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.955
Oh, your one true god
is now relatable.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.059
<i>So, perhaps,</i>

18:13.160 --> 18:16.296
Alberta's motivations were
more complicated than they seem.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.465
If your theory is correct,

18:18.565 --> 18:20.933
Alberta wasn't just
a tremendous talent.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.204
She was also a crusader
against unfair body standards,

18:24.304 --> 18:25.538
which, honestly,

18:25.638 --> 18:27.640
only makes me more impressed
by her.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.676
Yes! I got Todd back!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.611
And makes my desire
to clone her even greater.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.780
What?
Congratulations.

18:35.014 --> 18:35.982
You know,
it's interesting, Todd.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.517
If Alberta were here,
I feel like

18:37.617 --> 18:38.918
she'd probably be
pretty grateful

18:39.018 --> 18:41.354
this whole rat story came
to light.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.689
She might even

18:42.789 --> 18:44.624
call me a hero
for inviting you over

18:44.724 --> 18:46.159
and discovering the diary.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.494
Okay, girl. Calm down.

18:47.594 --> 18:48.928
Look at Clara.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.331
She kind of does looks mean,
doesn't she?

18:51.431 --> 18:52.665
Gadzooks, I know that woman.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.501
What are you talking about?
Oh, yeah.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.036
She was here the night Alberta
performed at the mansion.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.605
The night I was murdered?
Are you sure?

18:58.705 --> 19:02.008
Yeah, she was wearing
this really big hat.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.376
Oh, yes.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.677
Do you know
what this means?

19:04.777 --> 19:07.580
We have our very first suspect.

19:09.015 --> 19:12.018
Oh, great gasp,
everyone. Bravo.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.254
Are you okay?

19:14.354 --> 19:17.457
I asked you a question,
and you just spaced out.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.726
You do that a lot.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.133
Well, you picked a good one.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.601
What is this? What's happening?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.203
Yeah. I mean, the last one
made such a racket.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.805
What? No. No.
The last one was fine.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.174
Well, this bad boy's
the quietest in the market.

19:35.275 --> 19:39.178
No! Put it down!
Put it down this instant!

19:39.279 --> 19:43.716
Jay! Who are you to play God?

19:46.986 --> 19:49.722
Goodbye, old friend.

19:49.822 --> 19:53.493
I will always remember...
your spin cycle.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.895
You know, you don't need
a washing machine

19:55.995 --> 19:57.630
to achieve the feeling.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.566
You don't?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.034
There are so many other things
you can do.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.036
Hmm.
Here.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.838
Walk with me.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.011
Dear Lord.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.213
Oh, I would never!
