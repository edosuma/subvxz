<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>
<i>Here are a few things that</i>

00:02.391 --> 00:04.491
<i>that you might need to know.</i>
<i>I've had a suspicion</i>

00:04.533 --> 00:07.268
<i>that something's happening</i>
<i>behind the scenes here.</i>

00:07.286 --> 00:09.604
I knew it! We were right.

00:09.639 --> 00:12.474
<i>X-13 gas--</i>
<i>short-term memory eraser.</i>

00:12.508 --> 00:14.643
<i>They'll forget</i>
<i>the last 24 hours.</i>

00:14.677 --> 00:15.810
Lester, something
really weird is up.

00:15.845 --> 00:17.162
Last thing I remember
is that there's

00:17.213 --> 00:18.513
something going on
underneath the Buy More.

00:18.547 --> 00:20.348
Nice to meet you.
I'm Nicholas Quinn.

00:20.383 --> 00:22.000
<i>And I'm about to become</i>
<i>the Intersect.</i>

00:22.051 --> 00:23.918
have your husband.
Bring the Intersect

00:23.953 --> 00:25.587
<i>to the San Pedro docks,</i>
<i>pier 23</i>

00:25.621 --> 00:27.155
It was a trap!

00:27.189 --> 00:28.323
We got to get out of here!

00:29.659 --> 00:31.192
Walker, no!
Don't do it!

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

00:53.816 --> 00:55.483
So, we're taking
the bullet train, huh?

00:55.501 --> 00:58.019
You nailed it, genius.

01:04.025 --> 01:06.695
The Tokaido Shinkansen
will be departing in ten minutes.

01:06.729 --> 01:10.031
So, Nagoya, Osaka
or Kyoto, Quinn?

01:10.066 --> 01:11.633
What's the
lucky city...?

01:11.667 --> 01:12.867
The location's a secret.

01:12.902 --> 01:14.035
Naturally.

01:14.070 --> 01:15.870
I still don't know
what you expect from me.

01:15.905 --> 01:18.206
I told you...
You didn't know how to fix the Intersect.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.408
Yes, you mentioned that.

01:20.443 --> 01:21.776
Maybe you failed in the past

01:21.811 --> 01:23.478
because you didn't have
my servers

01:23.512 --> 01:25.914
or my technicians,
or maybe you weren't

01:25.948 --> 01:28.750
properly incentivized.

01:28.784 --> 01:31.219
What's that supposed to mean?

01:31.253 --> 01:33.388
You didn't have
a gun to your head.

01:33.422 --> 01:34.656
But you will this time.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.057
But without the Intersect
in front of me,

01:36.092 --> 01:37.358
I have nothing
to fix.

01:37.376 --> 01:39.327
I got word that your friends,
Walker and Casey,

01:39.361 --> 01:41.062
just delivered
the Intersect glasses to my men.

01:41.097 --> 01:44.365
They're en route
to my base.

01:46.402 --> 01:48.570
You've had your time, Bartowski.

01:48.604 --> 01:50.538
Now it's my time.

01:52.541 --> 01:55.343
And don't think that
you're going to get rescued.

01:55.377 --> 01:57.011
There's a second part
to that communication.

01:57.046 --> 01:58.012
It's bad news.

01:58.047 --> 02:00.381
Your friends are dead.

02:25.641 --> 02:27.008
Train rolls out
in seven minutes.

02:27.042 --> 02:28.242
We are right on time.

02:28.260 --> 02:29.878
Everything goes
pretty smooth

02:29.912 --> 02:31.045
when you put on
the Intersect, huh?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.430
To a point.

02:32.465 --> 02:34.415
Come on, we took out
Quinn's henchman in a snap,

02:34.450 --> 02:36.417
and in five minutes,
I had flashed on the computer

02:36.452 --> 02:37.786
and sent out
those phony communiques.

02:37.820 --> 02:38.953
It is useful.

02:38.988 --> 02:40.522
You're awfully good at it.

02:40.556 --> 02:42.223
You thought how Chuck's gonna
take the news?

02:42.258 --> 02:44.125
I will find the right time
to tell him.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.560
And besides,
when we get off this train,

02:45.594 --> 02:47.328
the Intersect in my head
is going to be suppressed,

02:47.363 --> 02:49.364
so he'll be fine.

02:49.398 --> 02:51.483
Uh-huh. One last thing,
just for grins.

02:53.268 --> 02:55.069
Name, rank and serial number.

02:55.104 --> 02:57.739
Oh, come on, I've had this
in my head for three days.

02:57.773 --> 03:00.141
It took Morgan a month to
start losing his memory.

03:00.176 --> 03:01.676
I think I have
some time.

03:01.710 --> 03:02.827
Now, let's move, Frank.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.847
Relax, Casey.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.082
I'm kidding.

03:08.116 --> 03:10.668
Also took Morgan
a month to be a jerk.

03:10.719 --> 03:12.253
Guys, I don't mean to be a jerk,

03:12.288 --> 03:14.222
but I should be in Tokyo
with Sarah and Casey,

03:14.256 --> 03:16.140
not stuck here
like some lab rat.

03:16.175 --> 03:17.258
Well, tough.

03:17.292 --> 03:18.960
Sarah has the same version
of the Intersect

03:18.994 --> 03:20.962
that made you lose memory
and deteriorate socially.

03:20.980 --> 03:23.398
As in, breaking up with me
via text message.

03:23.432 --> 03:25.934
Which made us stronger.

03:25.968 --> 03:27.535
So, we're trying
to be proactive,

03:27.570 --> 03:29.303
determine the cause.

03:29.321 --> 03:30.638
We got to poke around
in your prefrontal

03:30.673 --> 03:31.639
and temporal lobes, dude.

03:31.674 --> 03:33.374
Mm, I should be
out there in the action.

03:33.409 --> 03:35.360
I got to go out
on this mission, man! Just...

03:35.411 --> 03:37.445
By helping me, you are
helping the mission, okay?

03:37.479 --> 03:38.780
If we can
figure this out,

03:38.814 --> 03:40.215
then we can help save Sarah from

03:40.249 --> 03:41.783
the deleterious
side effects.

03:41.817 --> 03:43.150
That's a good point.

03:43.168 --> 03:44.319
Okay, you're right.

03:44.353 --> 03:46.153
What does "deleterious" mean?

03:46.171 --> 03:48.823
Could be worse than we thought.

03:48.858 --> 03:51.175
Don't worry, honey, Morgan's
vocabulary never really expanded

03:51.210 --> 03:52.861
beyond cereal boxes
and comic books.

03:52.895 --> 03:54.996
I'll have you know
there are puzzles on them

03:55.030 --> 03:56.464
that can be quite challenging.

03:56.498 --> 03:58.399
It's okay, Morgan.
You're gonna get through this.

03:58.434 --> 04:00.167
I know, it's just, you know,
I'm a trained spy now.

04:00.185 --> 04:02.303
I should be out there, you know,
with my team, making the moves.

04:02.337 --> 04:04.072
Hold still, Morgan.
I'm a weapon, I got to-- Hey, now!

04:04.106 --> 04:05.540
Oh, that hurts!

04:05.574 --> 04:06.708
That's hurty.

04:06.742 --> 04:08.409
My hero.

04:10.012 --> 04:13.181
The train will be departing
in two minutes.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.367
Hmm.

04:38.607 --> 04:40.224
Hey!

04:40.259 --> 04:41.375
Hey.

04:41.393 --> 04:42.877
Hey, guys.

04:42.895 --> 04:44.879
It was stuffy in here,

04:44.914 --> 04:46.948
you know, so I thought
I'd open the window,

04:46.982 --> 04:49.183
and then thought
maybe I'd escape.

04:49.218 --> 04:52.236
Your tricky little ring--
say good-bye to it.

04:52.271 --> 04:53.855
You don't want to do that.

04:55.658 --> 04:57.425
Sarah, thank God.

04:57.459 --> 04:59.294
I knew you weren't dead.
How'd you get here?

04:59.328 --> 05:01.228
Have to tell you about it
as soon as we're safe.

05:03.082 --> 05:05.900
♪

05:08.737 --> 05:09.921
Hey-o!

05:25.754 --> 05:28.389
That was some major
ass whupping, honey.

05:28.424 --> 05:29.807
What, have you been
taking Strip Kick?

05:29.858 --> 05:31.192
I did upgrade
my fighting technique.

05:31.226 --> 05:32.393
We'll talk about that later.

05:32.427 --> 05:33.895
The train is now departing.

05:33.929 --> 05:35.596
First stop: Yamashiro Station.

05:40.269 --> 05:41.769
We got to get out of here.

05:41.787 --> 05:43.488
Okay, let's go.

05:43.539 --> 05:45.289
Casey, how you doing
with the cargo door?

05:45.324 --> 05:48.442
It's sealed.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.944
I'm working on an override.

05:49.979 --> 05:51.612
We may have missed
our window though.

05:51.630 --> 05:52.981
Don't worry,
when I get there,

05:53.015 --> 05:55.133
I'll just have to f--
uh, figure something out.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.118
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
We always do.

05:59.822 --> 06:01.589
We're out of luck
on the door.

06:01.623 --> 06:03.091
It won't let me override.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.475
We're going too fast.

06:04.510 --> 06:07.428
Let me take
a stab at it.

06:09.682 --> 06:13.434
Well, it looks like somebody
sent me false messages.

06:13.469 --> 06:15.336
I don't know
how you did it,

06:15.371 --> 06:17.705
but, uh, I'll applaud later.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.640
Meanwhile, nobody moves.

06:26.365 --> 06:29.017
You don't want to do that!
I know more than you think!

06:31.653 --> 06:33.705
Well, you got out of
that coffin; can he?

06:33.756 --> 06:35.023
No, we put digital locks
in there.

06:35.057 --> 06:36.657
He'll never figure out
the combo.

06:36.692 --> 06:38.342
There's a coupling
under the train

06:38.377 --> 06:40.161
that connects
to an exhaust intake.

06:40.195 --> 06:43.398
I remember that from a schematic
that I flashed on.

06:43.432 --> 06:45.533
If we can get down there,
maybe we can jump off.

06:45.567 --> 06:46.868
Easy for you
to say, Walker.

06:46.902 --> 06:48.502
I think Bartowski and I

06:48.520 --> 06:51.005
are stuck on this bucket
till Yamashiro Station.

06:54.109 --> 06:55.910
I'm sorry,

06:55.944 --> 06:57.745
did you just
say "flashed"?

06:57.780 --> 06:59.147
As in...?

06:59.181 --> 07:00.064
Shh.

07:03.085 --> 07:05.536
Oh, Chuck, honey,

07:05.571 --> 07:08.189
I, um,

07:08.223 --> 07:11.592
I have the Intersect.

07:15.881 --> 07:17.398
Surprise.

Okay.

08:02.590 --> 08:05.099
So Sarah, explain to me please,

08:05.100 --> 08:08.268
uh, when, how and why you
downloaded the you-know-what?

08:08.286 --> 08:10.771
Okay, we'll talk about it
in a minute, I promise.

08:10.789 --> 08:14.324
Train lands at Yamashiro
in about an hour and a half.

08:14.376 --> 08:15.626
Until then, we're stuck.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.578
Well, I'll have Beckman
meet us with CIA

08:17.612 --> 08:20.381
and Japanese Intelligence
to take control of Quinn.

08:20.415 --> 08:22.949
I'll ask her to bring
the suppression device.

08:22.967 --> 08:24.752
Chuck, does Quinn
have any other men

08:24.786 --> 08:26.587
with him on
this train?

08:26.621 --> 08:27.921
Wait, you-you

08:27.956 --> 08:30.858
wouldn't have downloaded
the same version

08:30.892 --> 08:33.092
of the
that Morgan had, would you?

08:33.128 --> 08:34.695
Okay, I did, yes,

08:34.729 --> 08:36.830
but we will talk about
it in two seconds, okay?

08:36.865 --> 08:38.799
We'll need to lay low,
keep guard on him.

08:38.832 --> 08:40.768
I'll take first watch,
you two pretend to be

08:40.802 --> 08:42.102
gaijin tourists or something.

08:42.136 --> 08:43.020
Let's go.

08:45.373 --> 08:48.158
All right, well,
now that we have that covered,

08:48.193 --> 08:50.661
there's a few more bullet points
I'd like to go over

08:50.695 --> 08:52.496
regarding what the hell
is going on, Sarah.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.364
That computer erased
Morgan's memory.

08:56.484 --> 08:58.819
Morgan, you're helping
the mission.

08:58.837 --> 09:00.120
Just keep telling yourself that.

09:00.155 --> 09:01.121
Yeah, I know.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.340
I just, I don't know, man.

09:03.374 --> 09:05.125
I-I just feel like,
no matter how much

09:05.160 --> 09:06.877
they poke around in my skull
and look around in there,

09:06.928 --> 09:08.228
they're just, they're not
going to find anything.

09:08.263 --> 09:09.296
You know?

09:09.330 --> 09:10.631
Okay, ha-ha.

09:10.665 --> 09:12.099
Come on.
Yeah, I know.

09:12.133 --> 09:14.718
Well, looks pretty normal.

09:14.769 --> 09:16.470
There's no evident
long-term effects from having

09:16.504 --> 09:18.205
the Intersect.
I still don't know

09:18.239 --> 09:19.873
what caused the memory loss

09:19.908 --> 09:21.558
and why it triggered
after a month?

09:21.609 --> 09:23.911
All right, in the month between
him getting the Intersect

09:23.945 --> 09:25.212
and his amnesia, what happened?

09:25.246 --> 09:29.399
Castle was
renovated, retooled.

09:29.451 --> 09:31.018
Carmichael Industries
was formed.

09:31.052 --> 09:32.653
And then they started
going on missions.

09:32.687 --> 09:34.388
Anything different
happen on missions?

09:34.422 --> 09:36.039
Uh, I started
wearing tight slacks.

09:36.074 --> 09:39.026
Any-any head trauma,
concussions?

09:39.060 --> 09:40.077
What? No, no.

09:40.128 --> 09:41.195
Nobody would even
close to me, okay?

09:41.229 --> 09:42.396
I would just flash
and then bam,

09:42.430 --> 09:43.664
I dropped those baddies
like they were hot.

09:43.698 --> 09:44.998
You would flash.

09:45.033 --> 09:46.433
Were you flashing
before missions?

09:46.468 --> 09:48.252
Didn't have to.
But out in the field,

09:48.303 --> 09:49.736
I was busting out
the Intersect all the time.

09:49.771 --> 09:51.104
That's when you became a douche.

09:51.139 --> 09:53.073
Would you say "douche"?
It seems like...

09:53.107 --> 09:54.708
Maybe there's
a correlation between

09:54.742 --> 09:55.709
the number
of flashes...

09:55.743 --> 09:56.743
And brain deterioration.

09:56.778 --> 09:57.744
Guys, that's brilliant.

09:57.779 --> 09:59.012
Can I go to Japan now?

09:59.047 --> 10:00.264
No, no. This is
just a hypothesis.

10:00.315 --> 10:01.398
We have more work to do.

10:01.432 --> 10:03.901
Of course you do.

10:03.935 --> 10:05.435
Morgan, what's gonna
make you feel better?

10:05.487 --> 10:06.436
Pizza?

10:06.488 --> 10:07.855
Eh, I don't know.

10:07.889 --> 10:09.223
Combos?

10:09.257 --> 10:10.757
You know me so well.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.861
Pizza Combos!

10:13.895 --> 10:15.195
That...

10:15.229 --> 10:16.830
was my favorite growing up.

10:16.865 --> 10:18.415
Pizza Combos.

10:18.449 --> 10:19.600
<i>We were surrounded.</i>

10:19.634 --> 10:21.401
And so there really was
no choice.

10:21.436 --> 10:22.803
No, no, of course.

10:22.837 --> 10:24.238
I-I get it.

10:24.272 --> 10:25.239
It's just,

10:25.273 --> 10:26.707
with what Morgan
went through...

10:26.741 --> 10:28.609
Ellie's working with him to head
off any possible complications.

10:28.643 --> 10:31.111
And this will be gone
in an hour and a half.

10:31.145 --> 10:32.880
I promise.

10:34.916 --> 10:38.252
Okay, so I guess
we just chill, then.

10:54.836 --> 10:56.094
It's the coolest thing
in the world, isn't it?

10:56.119 --> 10:57.004
The coolest ever.

10:57.005 --> 10:59.606
Did you do any parkour?
Off a bridge, onto a moving truck,

10:59.624 --> 11:01.575
and then onto a car
going the opposite direction.

11:01.609 --> 11:02.609
Ohh, awesome!

11:02.644 --> 11:04.478
You know, I've been a spy
for so long,

11:04.512 --> 11:06.580
and I've never felt this
powerful in my entire life.

11:06.614 --> 11:08.715
It's incredible.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.817
Are you ready to say
good-bye to all of it?

11:11.836 --> 11:14.721
The guns, the bullets,
the parkour?

11:14.756 --> 11:17.057
I don't want to live my life
in danger anymore.

11:17.091 --> 11:20.127
I'm ready to retire
and start a family.

11:22.063 --> 11:24.665
Our future is exciting enough.

11:24.699 --> 11:26.967
Hm.

11:27.001 --> 11:30.137
You know, uh, we still
have a good bit of time

11:30.171 --> 11:31.505
before we get to Yamashiro.

11:31.539 --> 11:33.407
And starting a family's
not something

11:33.441 --> 11:35.509
you can just, you know,
jump right into.

11:35.543 --> 11:38.145
Yeah, no, uh...
we need some practice.

11:38.179 --> 11:39.813
Lots and lots of...

11:39.847 --> 11:41.748
practice...

11:41.783 --> 11:43.517
Allow me to set the mood,

11:43.551 --> 11:45.886
my lady.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.654
Yeah, we...

11:47.689 --> 11:49.189
Ooh.

11:49.223 --> 11:50.891
I have no idea what
any of this means.

11:50.925 --> 11:52.059
Is that a chicken button?

11:52.093 --> 11:54.895
Does a chicken come out
when you hit the button?

12:04.606 --> 12:06.006
Hey... well done.

12:07.775 --> 12:10.944
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto.

12:10.979 --> 12:12.346
Bring it in here.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.680
Let's go make us some sexy...

12:15.416 --> 12:17.401
♪

12:21.372 --> 12:22.706
Who the hell are you?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.157
Hey, great.
We're with the Flu Bus.

12:24.191 --> 12:25.409
Did you get your flu shot?

12:25.460 --> 12:27.961
I do not believe in shots
or inoculations.

12:27.996 --> 12:29.863
Who authorized this?
Morgan Grimes.

12:31.966 --> 12:34.968
Nobody tells nobody nothing.

12:35.003 --> 12:36.420
Oh, hell no.

12:36.471 --> 12:39.373
This place will not
fall to seed on my watch.

12:39.407 --> 12:41.308
We have a lot of
expensive new

12:41.342 --> 12:43.577
inventory here;
you will not destroy it!

12:43.611 --> 12:45.379
It's for selling microwaves.

12:45.413 --> 12:47.147
Not for exploding eggs,
avocados,

12:47.181 --> 12:49.599
Christmas tree ornaments,
fluorescent light tubes,

12:49.651 --> 12:52.085
bars of oatmeal soap,
or a football.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.220
Fine. Be lame.
Son,

12:54.238 --> 12:56.056
have you considered that maybe
it's time for you to grow up?

12:56.090 --> 12:57.557
Like your friend Jeffrey?

12:57.575 --> 12:59.226
Thank you.
You're the best.

12:59.260 --> 13:02.946
Is it really your destiny
to be a complete moron?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.250
Oh, Lord.

13:07.285 --> 13:09.536
I overheard what Big Mike said,
and I hope it sank in.

13:09.570 --> 13:10.954
It did not.
Leave me be.

13:11.005 --> 13:12.589
Jeffrey, stop it.
I know what you're thinking,

13:12.623 --> 13:14.574
and I do not want to
discuss this topic again.

13:14.609 --> 13:16.176
What are you
so afraid of, Lester?

13:16.210 --> 13:17.744
Maybe this is our destiny.

13:17.762 --> 13:19.262
Look, they're just dreams, man.

13:19.297 --> 13:21.915
How can they be dreams if we're
both having the same dream?

13:21.949 --> 13:24.518
The fallen snow,
a different Buy More?

13:24.552 --> 13:26.887
It's like someone tried to
wipe our memories clean.

13:26.921 --> 13:28.255
I know, it's true.
It's just...

13:28.289 --> 13:30.590
It scares me.
We can't be scared.

13:30.625 --> 13:31.858
We have to figure out

13:31.893 --> 13:34.161
who would want to scour
our minds, and why.

13:35.997 --> 13:37.981
I think better when
I'm blowing up avocados.

13:39.233 --> 13:41.735
There are mysterious
happenings around here,

13:41.769 --> 13:43.487
and we can't
ignore them anymore.

13:45.272 --> 13:47.273
Hey.

13:55.717 --> 13:57.718
Had your flu shot?
Uh, yeah. Thanks.

13:58.469 --> 13:59.786
How about you get another,

13:59.804 --> 14:01.855
or I will kill you right here?

14:01.889 --> 14:03.890
Don't make a sound.

14:08.062 --> 14:09.346
Did you see that?

14:09.397 --> 14:11.598
In my previous state
of impairment,

14:11.632 --> 14:12.966
I wouldn't have cared or noticed

14:12.984 --> 14:15.569
that Grimes's woman--
forgive me, not PC--

14:15.603 --> 14:19.372
Grimes's significant other
was just taken at gunpoint.

14:19.407 --> 14:24.044
The newly unimpaired you is
a master... of the obvious.

14:24.078 --> 14:25.245
This is the call.

14:25.279 --> 14:26.713
We'll find the truth,

14:26.748 --> 14:28.749
even if we have to
face mortal danger.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.752
Okay.

14:36.758 --> 14:39.543
Cherry blossoms.

14:39.594 --> 14:40.961
Colonel, would you mind

14:40.995 --> 14:42.562
opening the lid for a moment?

14:42.597 --> 14:44.397
I'd like to discuss
something with you.

14:44.432 --> 14:46.733
Not interested.

14:46.768 --> 14:48.401
Oh, you can keep
your gun on me.

14:48.436 --> 14:49.970
I won't try to escape.
In fact,

14:50.004 --> 14:52.005
there won't be any need to.

14:54.108 --> 14:56.943
Your daughter's name is
Alex McHugh, correct?

15:00.181 --> 15:03.583
If you want her to live,
do exactly as I say.

15:05.953 --> 15:07.420
Dad?

15:07.455 --> 15:08.955
I'm okay, but they have guns.

15:14.162 --> 15:17.164
And now the picket fence.

15:17.198 --> 15:19.599
See?

15:19.634 --> 15:20.867
I haven't forgotten anything.

15:20.902 --> 15:22.903
Mm-hmm.

15:23.604 --> 15:26.406
And perhaps...

15:27.441 --> 15:29.743
this little man.

15:31.262 --> 15:34.181
Or wo-man...

15:35.950 --> 15:37.684
...someday.

15:37.718 --> 15:40.954
Someday.

15:49.530 --> 15:50.831
It's a text from Casey.

15:50.865 --> 15:52.866
He needs a break.

15:55.203 --> 15:56.670
This is gonna be so good.

16:09.967 --> 16:12.219
Oh, oh, ooh.

16:12.253 --> 16:15.055
Hey, Casey, what is going on?
Where's Quinn?

16:16.090 --> 16:18.525
His men have Alex.

16:18.559 --> 16:22.329
I'm gonna need you to follow me.

16:23.364 --> 16:25.365
Sorry. I have no choice.

16:35.633 --> 16:37.534
I'm gonna need you two
to follow me now. Come on.

16:37.569 --> 16:41.271
Do what I say,
and no one gets hurt.

16:41.306 --> 16:43.941
Do what I say,
and nobody gets hurt.

16:43.975 --> 16:45.609
If you fight,

16:45.643 --> 16:47.578
or try to run,

16:47.612 --> 16:49.880
my sweet little daughter
gets her head blown off.

16:49.914 --> 16:52.816
And really sell
that one, Colonel.

16:54.819 --> 16:55.786
If you fight,

16:55.820 --> 16:58.255
or try to run,

16:58.289 --> 17:00.791
Alex gets her head blown off.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.597
Now, move to the control panel

17:06.631 --> 17:07.897
and shut down the dining car.

17:07.932 --> 17:09.465
I want some privacy.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.569
Go to the control panel, Chuck.
Open it.

17:12.604 --> 17:14.922
Move.
Okay...

17:17.040 --> 17:18.392
Shut down the dining car.

17:18.425 --> 17:19.910
Upper left.

17:19.944 --> 17:22.445
Hit it.

17:22.480 --> 17:25.482
<i>The dining car is closed</i>
<i>until further notice.</i>

17:35.693 --> 17:40.030
<i>Innquay say onway ommscay.</i>

17:40.064 --> 17:42.532
Enough of the kabuki!

17:42.567 --> 17:44.167
Move it out.

17:44.202 --> 17:45.435
Let's go.

17:50.908 --> 17:52.459
Chuck.

17:52.510 --> 17:53.961
Text Morgan.

17:54.012 --> 17:55.712
Tell him to get
Alex to safety.

17:55.746 --> 17:57.781
Do it.

18:02.186 --> 18:04.104
"Alex in danger.

18:04.138 --> 18:06.256
Get her to Castle ASAP."

18:06.291 --> 18:07.441
What is...? No.

18:07.475 --> 18:08.892
She's all good, guys.
She's with us.

18:08.926 --> 18:09.977
No, she's not.

18:10.028 --> 18:12.446
She went up to the Buy More
for Pizza Combos.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.697
She should be back by now.

18:13.731 --> 18:15.866
Wait a minute. Hold on a second.
What do you...?

18:20.705 --> 18:22.472
Well, she's not in the Buy More.

18:27.778 --> 18:29.479
Someone's taken her.

18:29.514 --> 18:31.648
Okay, we got a situation here.

18:37.922 --> 18:40.474
I don't know what
you want from me.

18:40.508 --> 18:41.725
I want you to shut up.

18:41.759 --> 18:43.627
Ron, what the hell's
the holdup?

18:43.661 --> 18:45.495
I don't know,
it just won't start.

18:45.530 --> 18:47.698
Well, we can't exactly
call for a tow.

18:47.732 --> 18:49.032
So we'll wait for instructions.

18:49.067 --> 18:50.834
If the order comes to kill her,

18:50.868 --> 18:52.202
we do it here.

18:52.236 --> 18:54.404
I'm not walking across

18:54.439 --> 18:56.073
this parking lot with
a gun in her ribs.

19:01.446 --> 19:03.363
Exactly what did you do?

19:03.414 --> 19:04.448
Sugared their gas tank.

19:04.482 --> 19:06.550
It's an oldie,
but a goodie.

19:06.584 --> 19:11.371
Man, I haven't shugged
a tank in... ds.

19:11.422 --> 19:12.923
Anyway, now that
they are incapacitated,

19:12.957 --> 19:15.392
in a mobile sense,
we need a plan.

19:15.426 --> 19:17.394
It should be keen and clever,
Mm-hmm.

19:17.428 --> 19:20.197
utilizing our unique talents.

19:20.231 --> 19:22.232
Do we have any of those?

19:22.266 --> 19:24.751
I think you are
uniquely wasteful

19:24.802 --> 19:26.803
and destructive.

19:28.306 --> 19:30.307
Let's build on that.

19:33.678 --> 19:36.146
Think Casey has a plan?

19:36.180 --> 19:37.681
I don't know;
he's not letting on.

19:37.715 --> 19:39.850
We don't really know
what's around that corner.

19:39.884 --> 19:41.768
But we can handle it, right?

19:41.819 --> 19:43.070
Of course.
It's just...

19:43.104 --> 19:45.989
The end is so near,
you can taste it?

19:48.025 --> 19:51.261
I want that house
and dog and baby, Sarah.

19:51.295 --> 19:53.964
Me, too.

19:53.998 --> 19:56.466
Okay, let's wrap this up,
take out Quinn and save Alex.

19:56.501 --> 19:58.802
Save the day.

19:58.836 --> 20:00.837
Quinn said, stop whispering
like fourth-graders.

20:10.681 --> 20:12.382
Ah.

20:12.416 --> 20:14.351
Uh... tea?

20:15.386 --> 20:16.887
No?

20:18.523 --> 20:19.639
I'll get to the point.

20:19.690 --> 20:22.976
I want my Intersect technology,

20:23.027 --> 20:25.061
and someone has stolen it.

20:25.095 --> 20:27.998
Release Casey's daughter,
and we'll give you the glasses.

20:30.001 --> 20:30.984
You mean these?

20:32.270 --> 20:33.653
I had the Colonel fetch them.

20:33.704 --> 20:36.573
Worthless.

20:36.607 --> 20:38.341
But then again, you know that,

20:38.376 --> 20:40.844
because one of you...

20:40.878 --> 20:42.913
has the Intersect.

20:42.947 --> 20:45.882
Then you know you're outmanned.

20:45.917 --> 20:47.150
Casey's not gonna fire at us.

20:47.185 --> 20:48.468
He may.

20:48.503 --> 20:51.221
If I don't call my men

20:51.255 --> 20:53.523
on the half-hour,

20:53.558 --> 20:56.860
his little girl gets sprayed
with bullets.

20:56.894 --> 20:59.162
That half-hour's up
in two minutes, Quinn.

20:59.197 --> 21:00.163
I brought them here.

21:00.198 --> 21:01.982
Make the call.

21:08.473 --> 21:09.906
Uh-uh-uh.

21:13.027 --> 21:15.745
I have something
I want to say, first.

21:15.780 --> 21:17.514
You're gonna help me.

21:17.548 --> 21:20.684
A pristine version
of the Intersect

21:20.718 --> 21:22.552
is available.

21:22.587 --> 21:24.671
It's in a government facility.

21:24.705 --> 21:25.956
You're going to find it
and download it

21:25.990 --> 21:27.290
onto these glasses.

21:27.325 --> 21:28.391
Time's up, Quinn.

21:28.426 --> 21:30.594
Call your men off my daughter.

21:32.063 --> 21:33.430
Do it.

21:37.969 --> 21:39.603
Hey, it's Quinn.

21:39.637 --> 21:41.188
Uh, yeah, the little lady

21:41.222 --> 21:43.106
gets another half-hour.

21:43.724 --> 21:46.510
You happy?
That's all I need.

21:46.544 --> 21:48.278
Half hour's an eternity.

21:48.312 --> 21:50.380
I'll come up with some way
to save her.

21:50.414 --> 21:52.015
Ooh...

22:10.334 --> 22:12.035
Walker, pull up!

22:12.069 --> 22:14.638
Sarah, we might need
to trade him for Alex!

22:14.672 --> 22:16.089
No!

22:21.512 --> 22:22.896
Maybe he hit that station,

22:22.930 --> 22:24.898
the one you were talking
about. Maybe...

22:24.932 --> 22:26.600
I don't know what happened.
I just couldn't stop.

22:26.651 --> 22:28.218
God!

22:30.354 --> 22:31.655
Sarah!

22:40.747 --> 22:42.297
I don't know what happened.

22:42.348 --> 22:44.850
I wanted it to stop,

22:44.851 --> 22:47.586
and I couldn't;
I just kept flashing.

22:47.604 --> 22:49.321
God, I screwed up so bad.

22:49.356 --> 22:50.556
No, no.
No-no-no-no-no.

22:50.590 --> 22:52.124
Hey, this is not
your fault, okay?

22:52.158 --> 22:53.859
Look, Casey is
working on a plan

22:53.894 --> 22:55.194
with Morgan as we speak,

22:55.228 --> 22:56.445
and Ellie's working
on the Intersect.

22:56.479 --> 22:57.930
I'm sure she'll think
of something.

22:57.948 --> 23:01.033
I didn't want to flash
a second time, Chuck.

23:01.067 --> 23:03.202
I don't have control of it
anymore.

23:07.574 --> 23:10.342
Sis, talk to me.

23:10.377 --> 23:11.744
The amount that Sarah's
been flashing

23:11.778 --> 23:13.212
is directly compromising
her motor control,

23:13.246 --> 23:16.248
causing the migraine, which
could be cranial pressure,

23:16.283 --> 23:18.050
so we don't want it
exacerbated at all.

23:18.084 --> 23:19.618
Is that what caused
Morgan's memory loss?

23:19.653 --> 23:21.020
I'm pretty certain.

23:21.054 --> 23:22.638
He barely flashed for a month,
and then

23:22.672 --> 23:24.840
when he started going on
missions, the numbers jumped.

23:24.891 --> 23:27.393
How many times before he started
feeling the effects?

23:27.427 --> 23:28.827
Well, he didn't have
a specific amount,

23:28.862 --> 23:30.696
but it was a few times a day.
What about Sarah?

23:31.932 --> 23:34.366
Baby, how many times
have you flashed?

23:34.401 --> 23:37.002
40 times.

23:39.005 --> 23:40.506
In two days?

23:40.540 --> 23:43.525
That intensity level
in such a short period

23:43.577 --> 23:45.778
has to be the cause.

23:45.812 --> 23:48.781
Okay, okay, the fix for now
until she can stop flashing:

23:48.815 --> 23:50.816
She has to get to me
or General Beckman

23:50.850 --> 23:53.118
so we can suppress
the Intersect, get her an MRI.

23:53.152 --> 23:54.503
Listen, Ellie, Sarah said

23:54.537 --> 23:56.355
that she can't control
when she flashes.

23:56.389 --> 23:57.523
Okay, that's a problem.

23:57.557 --> 23:59.425
We have to, we have to think.

23:59.459 --> 24:00.676
Think, Morgan!

24:00.710 --> 24:03.028
Can you sneak up on the Flu Bus
without being seen?

24:03.063 --> 24:05.097
Casey, listen to me.
We're coming at this blind.

24:05.131 --> 24:06.932
We don't exactly know
what they got

24:06.967 --> 24:09.034
in there weapon-wise.
You sure you don't want

24:09.069 --> 24:11.270
to just call in the CIA?
There's no time!

24:11.304 --> 24:12.605
I have an idea.

24:12.639 --> 24:14.607
Devon's gonna be the magnet.

24:14.641 --> 24:16.692
You, Morgan,
you're gonna pick a fight.

24:16.726 --> 24:18.110
A firefight.

24:18.144 --> 24:20.178
A f... a firefight?

24:20.196 --> 24:21.313
First thing that
you have to do is,

24:21.347 --> 24:22.615
you have to blindfold Sarah.

24:22.649 --> 24:24.283
She can't react
to what she can't see.

24:24.317 --> 24:27.036
Then, Chuck, I think
that there might be

24:27.070 --> 24:28.704
a way for you to build
a suppression device.

24:28.738 --> 24:30.189
It's a real long shot.

24:30.223 --> 24:31.890
I'm in the mood
for a long shot.

24:31.925 --> 24:33.859
General Beckman delivered me
the program for the suppressor.

24:33.893 --> 24:37.062
Maybe I can download it,
e-mail it to you.

24:37.097 --> 24:39.264
If I did,
could you build something

24:39.299 --> 24:40.666
and deliver it to Sarah?

24:40.700 --> 24:42.234
Not exactly.

24:42.268 --> 24:43.869
What if, one last time,
we just flashed...?

24:43.887 --> 24:45.004
No way!
Absolutely not!

24:45.038 --> 24:46.705
Baby, what if that's
the one that does

24:46.740 --> 24:47.973
the real damage
or kills you?

24:48.008 --> 24:50.075
Look, all I need is
a laptop, a PSP

24:50.110 --> 24:51.443
and some
virtual reality glasses.

24:51.478 --> 24:54.446
If I was in a Buy More, I'd have
it all in ten seconds...

24:54.481 --> 24:56.915
Wait. We have got something
better than the Buy More.

24:56.950 --> 25:00.052
We have a train full
of Japanese people.

25:00.086 --> 25:01.720
Quinn's thugs are expecting
a call in 19 minutes.

25:01.738 --> 25:03.355
When it doesn't come,
they're gonna kill Alex.

25:03.389 --> 25:05.240
And you are not gonna
let that happen. Clear?!

25:05.275 --> 25:08.327
Crystal. I will not
let my last words

25:08.361 --> 25:10.562
to Alex be a demand
for Pizza Combos.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.081
Go to my Crown Vic.

25:33.603 --> 25:35.471
Devon! Dev...

25:50.537 --> 25:52.955
Wow. Casey rolls strong.

25:52.989 --> 25:54.640
Like, raring-for-the-
Apocalypse strong.

25:54.674 --> 25:56.542
The case in front of you,
open it.

25:56.576 --> 25:59.545
Put in the comm device,
sync it to my phone. Do it.

26:01.214 --> 26:02.981
Okay, we're hot, boss.

26:03.016 --> 26:04.349
I'm gonna talk you through this.

26:04.384 --> 26:06.885
Grab a rifle, the Sig
and a survival knife.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.153
Leave the heavy stuff.

26:08.188 --> 26:09.621
You'll just blow yourself up.

26:11.991 --> 26:13.225
Yah!

26:17.347 --> 26:20.999
Just a few more minutes more,
and everything's gonna be good.

26:21.034 --> 26:23.135
Hang in there.

26:23.169 --> 26:25.270
All right, Chuck,

26:25.305 --> 26:26.872
I'm gonna start sending you
the file.

26:26.906 --> 26:28.607
And as soon as it's complete,

26:28.641 --> 26:29.942
put the glasses on Sarah.

26:29.976 --> 26:31.243
It should run right away.

26:31.277 --> 26:33.011
It's coming in strong, El.

26:33.046 --> 26:34.613
You're gonna be all right,
Sarah.

26:38.351 --> 26:42.488
Chuck, I didn't want to say
anything before, but...

26:42.522 --> 26:45.457
but this whole time you've
been talking about Alex

26:45.492 --> 26:46.992
and how she's in danger?

26:47.026 --> 26:49.394
Yeah? Why?

26:49.429 --> 26:52.264
I don't, um...

26:52.298 --> 26:54.633
I don't remember
anybody named Alex.

27:07.814 --> 27:09.898
Do you remember this?

27:13.086 --> 27:15.871
Yeah. I wouldn't forget that.

27:15.905 --> 27:18.490
Everything's gonna be fine,
okay?

27:18.525 --> 27:20.025
Of course it is.

27:20.059 --> 27:22.027
It's gonna be fine, Sarah.

27:22.045 --> 27:24.096
You're gonna be fine.

27:26.049 --> 27:27.583
Casey, we are ready to roll.

27:32.572 --> 27:34.139
Okay, Morgan, listen up.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.758
You find an some cover 20 meters
from the target. Got it?

27:36.810 --> 27:39.228
Okay, I see a Civic
that might serve our purpose.

27:39.262 --> 27:41.230
Which is what, exactly?

27:41.264 --> 27:42.598
Devon's gonna call them out.

27:42.649 --> 27:44.550
And you, Morgan, you're gonna
do some sniper work.

27:44.584 --> 27:46.218
Some wet work. Got it?

27:46.236 --> 27:47.886
Just so you know,

27:47.904 --> 27:51.056
I've never sniped
in my life, wet or dry.

27:51.074 --> 27:53.025
Just remember,
you're sniping for Alex.

27:53.059 --> 27:56.028
For Alex. I'll snipe for Alex.

27:56.062 --> 27:57.579
Yeah, you got it.

27:57.614 --> 27:59.397
You ready?
Hell, yeah! All right.

27:59.415 --> 28:01.166
There's some wind
kicking up here.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.668
I'll probably have
to overcompensate.

28:02.702 --> 28:04.236
Probably about
30 degrees.

28:04.254 --> 28:06.038
Don't nudge a guy
when he's sniping!

28:06.923 --> 28:09.074
Oh, man!

28:09.108 --> 28:11.143
I can't believe we're this terrible.
Yeah, you are.

28:11.177 --> 28:12.978
- Hand over the rifle, little man.
- Morgan?

28:13.012 --> 28:14.296
Let's go!

28:14.347 --> 28:16.381
Easy!
I'm not your little sister!

28:16.415 --> 28:18.300
Morgan!

28:18.351 --> 28:20.352
Morgan, what the hell's
happening?

28:21.771 --> 28:23.288
Morgan!

28:25.124 --> 28:26.959
Hello?

28:26.993 --> 28:29.311
Who the hell is this?

28:29.362 --> 28:32.664
I might ask you the same
question, little earling.

28:32.699 --> 28:34.566
Lester? Lester Patel?!

28:39.272 --> 28:41.306
Maybe...

28:43.042 --> 28:45.510
Hey, Morgan was taken.

28:45.545 --> 28:48.830
Jeff and Lester
are my only option.

28:50.216 --> 28:51.583
Look, I know this sounds crazy,

28:51.618 --> 28:53.685
but I've worked with those guys
for years.

28:53.720 --> 28:55.821
They may seem like botulism
victims, but they're loyal.

28:55.855 --> 28:57.890
They can do it.

28:59.926 --> 29:01.526
Lester, now I'm gonna tell you

29:01.561 --> 29:04.229
something I never dreamed
I'd tell you,

29:04.264 --> 29:06.231
never dreamed
I'd have to tell you,

29:06.266 --> 29:07.849
but the situation is extreme.

29:07.901 --> 29:11.486
This is Colonel John Casey of
the National Security Agency.

29:11.521 --> 29:13.338
That is so funny.
There's a John Casey

29:13.373 --> 29:14.489
who works at the Buy More.

29:14.524 --> 29:15.574
That's me, you idiot!

29:15.608 --> 29:17.042
I'm NSA.

29:17.076 --> 29:18.527
Sarah Walker, Chuck Bartowski,
they're CIA.

29:18.578 --> 29:20.245
They are so not.

29:20.280 --> 29:22.414
They are so so,
you colossal dope!

29:22.448 --> 29:24.199
Now...

29:24.250 --> 29:26.351
I need you,
my daughter needs you,

29:26.386 --> 29:27.853
and your country needs you.

29:29.522 --> 29:31.206
Canada?

29:32.926 --> 29:34.893
Patel, listen up.

29:34.928 --> 29:37.930
You do what I tell you,
I'll make you a hero.

29:40.266 --> 29:41.833
It's the call.

29:41.868 --> 29:44.202
Go to my Crown Vic.

29:47.941 --> 29:49.574
Each of you grab a pistol.

29:49.609 --> 29:51.343
Leave the big stuff.

30:34.194 --> 30:36.111
The call never
came from Quinn.

30:36.146 --> 30:37.696
We'll kill them all
and leave the bus.

30:41.368 --> 30:42.434
Her first.

30:42.452 --> 30:43.369
Don't you touch her!

30:43.403 --> 30:44.603
Or what?

30:44.637 --> 30:46.805
Attention, Flu Bus.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.625
We have tapped into your
internal public address.

30:49.659 --> 30:52.111
We are armed and dangerous
and suggest

30:52.145 --> 30:53.645
you surrender immediately. Over!

30:53.680 --> 30:55.447
Who the hell is that?

30:55.482 --> 30:56.882
I have no idea.

30:56.916 --> 30:59.284
But somebody's getting
ready to lose a limb.

30:59.302 --> 31:01.854
We appreciate
that you, too, are armed.

31:01.888 --> 31:04.289
But we have heat vision,
infrared scopes,

31:04.324 --> 31:07.159
laser guidance system and armor-
piercing bullets. Over!

31:07.193 --> 31:09.895
I think this is where
we should get down.

31:09.929 --> 31:11.797
Nobody has all that.
It's a bluff.

31:31.384 --> 31:34.086
You're outgunned,
outmanned,

31:34.120 --> 31:37.222
out... side.

31:37.257 --> 31:39.224
And it's a lovely day.

31:39.259 --> 31:42.561
So throw down your gun
and nobody gets hurt.

31:42.595 --> 31:44.563
You're the one

31:44.597 --> 31:46.231
who should be worried
about getting hurt.

31:46.266 --> 31:47.166
Uh!

31:54.724 --> 31:58.577
Behold the flame of destiny!
Ha-ha!

32:06.035 --> 32:07.853
What he said.

32:15.078 --> 32:18.530
Boys, we cannot
thank you enough.

32:18.565 --> 32:20.499
How do we begin
to even repay you?

32:20.533 --> 32:23.268
There is a way.

32:23.303 --> 32:24.870
Honesty.

32:24.904 --> 32:26.772
We know that there is
something going on.

32:26.806 --> 32:29.541
Something spy...

32:29.576 --> 32:30.742
ish.

32:30.777 --> 32:32.544
We need the truth
at this point.

32:32.579 --> 32:34.212
Come on.

32:35.648 --> 32:37.065
Yeah, you do.

32:37.100 --> 32:39.284
Gentlemen,
follow me.

32:39.319 --> 32:40.519
Dad, don't worry.

32:40.553 --> 32:41.937
I'm fine. I promise.

32:41.988 --> 32:44.790
Morgan and Devon
were great, but...

32:44.824 --> 32:46.558
This is so cool!
My <i>Missile Command.</i>

32:46.576 --> 32:48.410
...those guys
that you talk about,

32:48.444 --> 32:49.828
the ones
that give you nightmares--

32:49.863 --> 32:51.797
Jeff and Lester--

32:51.831 --> 32:53.999
yeah, they were the real heroes.

32:54.033 --> 32:56.168
It's a miracle.

32:56.202 --> 32:57.569
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,

32:57.604 --> 32:59.404
Jeffrey, Jeffrey,
yeah, no, no, no.

32:59.422 --> 33:01.807
I got the whole thing on.
Dangerous!

33:01.841 --> 33:04.276
When are you coming back?

33:04.310 --> 33:05.961
We're on our way.

33:07.647 --> 33:09.248
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Problemo.

33:10.650 --> 33:11.817
Alex, I'm going
to call you back.

33:11.851 --> 33:13.302
So glad you're safe.

33:15.121 --> 33:16.822
Internet went down.
Well, maybe it's nothing,

33:16.856 --> 33:18.290
but if there's one thing I know,

33:18.324 --> 33:19.825
it's how to fix
an Internet connection.

33:19.859 --> 33:21.660
The control panel
is between the last

33:21.694 --> 33:23.362
passenger car and
the dining car.

33:23.396 --> 33:25.314
I remember that
from my prep flash.

33:25.365 --> 33:27.115
Easy peasy.

33:28.401 --> 33:29.952
Keep your guard up.

33:48.304 --> 33:49.821
It's been tampered with.

33:49.856 --> 33:51.056
This is not good.

33:55.728 --> 33:57.312
No. Hey, uh... hey.

33:57.347 --> 33:59.631
I'm... I'm Burbank
Buy More, so I...

34:13.880 --> 34:14.913
A little warning.

34:14.947 --> 34:16.481
The only thing I
can't beat down

34:16.498 --> 34:17.666
is the Intersect itself,

34:17.699 --> 34:19.985
but I've studied the program
obsessively.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.319
You know, I've done
a little training myself,

34:21.337 --> 34:22.371
Quinn, so let's rumble.

34:28.895 --> 34:31.730
I can hear you pacing.

34:31.764 --> 34:33.849
Bartowski's really
taking his time.

34:35.301 --> 34:36.868
What are you thinking?

34:40.473 --> 34:42.741
Nothing.
He's probably just goofing off.

34:42.775 --> 34:45.744
You check on him, or I will.

34:47.897 --> 34:49.414
I'm going.

35:15.808 --> 35:17.709
Freeze! Now!

35:18.845 --> 35:20.211
Put it down,
Quinn.

35:21.247 --> 35:23.048
Down.

35:29.072 --> 35:30.939
Two on one-- that's not fair.

35:30.990 --> 35:32.791
How do I even things out?

35:32.825 --> 35:34.893
You move, he dies.

35:34.911 --> 35:36.328
Just let him go,
Quinn, okay?

35:36.362 --> 35:37.596
It's over.
You're on a train.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.164
Where are you
going to run to?

35:39.198 --> 35:40.248
I'll figure something out.

35:40.283 --> 35:43.735
It was never meant
to be like this, Bartowski.

35:43.770 --> 35:45.737
You weren't meant
to get involved.

35:45.772 --> 35:47.773
And until that
Intersect is mine,

35:47.807 --> 35:50.926
this is never going to end...
ever!

35:52.679 --> 35:54.262
- Chuck, what's happening?
- Chuck, come on.

35:54.297 --> 35:56.081
We're searching the train
for Quinn.

36:04.757 --> 36:07.092
Chuck, he's heading
towards the baggage car.

36:07.110 --> 36:08.894
Sarah, stay put.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.069
Step away from the
console, Quinn.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.506
Sarah!

36:21.541 --> 36:23.809
Focus on your... on your
fighting abilities, okay?

36:23.843 --> 36:24.976
Keep your
emotions even.

36:25.011 --> 36:26.945
Do not flash!
I'll try, Chuck.

36:30.016 --> 36:31.783
You won't survive
this one, Quinn.

36:33.353 --> 36:35.003
This is over.

36:35.054 --> 36:36.855
For good.

36:41.794 --> 36:43.161
Sarah!

36:43.196 --> 36:44.479
Is it?

36:45.681 --> 36:46.765
No!

36:46.799 --> 36:48.834
No!

36:48.868 --> 36:51.002
Maybe not over...

36:51.037 --> 36:52.704
quite yet.

36:54.574 --> 36:56.108
Open the door, baby!

36:56.142 --> 36:57.876
See if you can open the door.

36:58.911 --> 37:00.328
No!

37:00.363 --> 37:02.013
Sarah!

37:06.853 --> 37:08.370
Sarah!

37:16.345 --> 37:17.863
No!

37:18.898 --> 37:21.366
No! Sarah! No!

37:23.219 --> 37:24.903
No! Sarah!

37:24.937 --> 37:26.471
Sarah!

37:51.123 --> 37:52.090
You're up.

37:52.091 --> 37:53.241
Good.

37:53.276 --> 37:54.342
Let's get started.

37:54.377 --> 37:56.144
Quinn, this isn't
just going to end here.

37:56.179 --> 37:57.479
Shh. Don't.

37:57.513 --> 38:00.482
This is going my
way from now on.

38:00.516 --> 38:03.251
No more screwups,
no more left turns.

38:03.286 --> 38:06.388
The Intersect in your head
is rotten.

38:06.422 --> 38:07.856
We're going
to remove it

38:07.890 --> 38:09.457
with a suppression
device.

38:09.492 --> 38:13.795
And then I'm sending you
on a new mission to retrieve

38:13.829 --> 38:15.330
a pristine version
of the program.

38:15.364 --> 38:16.665
I'm not working for you.

38:16.699 --> 38:17.966
You are.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.136
Until I get what I want,
you're my soldier.

38:21.170 --> 38:23.238
Now...

38:23.272 --> 38:26.441
I know you lose memories
when you flash.

38:26.475 --> 38:28.176
These, for want
of a better term,

38:28.211 --> 38:29.477
are flash cards.

38:29.512 --> 38:31.479
They may look like
random images

38:31.514 --> 38:33.181
to someone who doesn't
have the Intersect,

38:33.216 --> 38:34.916
but to you,

38:34.951 --> 38:37.786
they're... stimulants.

38:37.820 --> 38:40.021
What are you saying?

38:48.231 --> 38:51.266
Until I get
what I want...

38:51.300 --> 38:52.684
you're mine.

39:00.042 --> 39:01.776
♪

39:12.788 --> 39:13.922
Hey, bro.

39:13.956 --> 39:17.125
Please... please try
to eat something, okay?

39:18.861 --> 39:21.229
I'll eat when I know
Sarah's all right.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.333
Quinn said
he needed Sarah

39:25.351 --> 39:26.668
to steal
Intersect technology

39:26.702 --> 39:27.736
from a government facility.

39:27.770 --> 39:29.170
I need to figure out
which one.

39:30.206 --> 39:31.706
I get it. I know.

39:31.741 --> 39:34.309
Hey, it's going
to happen, Chuck.

39:34.343 --> 39:36.578
All of it.
I promise.

39:36.612 --> 39:39.147
So close I can taste it.

39:39.181 --> 39:41.349
Hey.

39:41.384 --> 39:43.151
She set off
her emergency beacon.

39:43.185 --> 39:45.203
She's close.

39:45.237 --> 39:46.721
What did I
tell you? See?

39:48.857 --> 39:51.076
♪

40:05.057 --> 40:07.542
We'll get Sarah, Chuck.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.044
I know.

40:16.218 --> 40:17.519
Okay, guys.

40:17.553 --> 40:19.020
We got a lock on Sarah.

40:19.054 --> 40:21.356
The signal is strong.

40:43.446 --> 40:45.647
We'll find her.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.751
We'll find her.

41:37.183 --> 41:39.334
Whoa, Sarah.

41:39.368 --> 41:41.603
Sarah, Sarah, easy, girl.

41:41.637 --> 41:43.438
Who are you?

41:43.472 --> 41:45.473
Nicholas Quinn,
your handler.

41:46.842 --> 41:49.778
We've only known each other
for the past five years.

41:49.812 --> 41:52.197
I guess you're not
all back yet, huh?

41:52.248 --> 41:53.715
What do you mean?

41:55.451 --> 41:58.586
Well, you took a nasty blow
to the head.

41:58.621 --> 42:00.255
A week in the hospital.

42:00.289 --> 42:01.706
Any of that ring a bell?

42:01.757 --> 42:03.458
Japan?

42:03.492 --> 42:04.859
The bullet train?

42:04.894 --> 42:06.428
No?

42:06.462 --> 42:07.829
Well, doesn't matter.

42:08.864 --> 42:10.732
I'll fill you in
on the details.

42:11.767 --> 42:13.568
If you're fit for duty.

42:14.603 --> 42:16.304
I am.

42:16.338 --> 42:17.906
Good.

42:17.940 --> 42:19.674
Orders are in.

42:22.394 --> 42:24.512
Recognize this face?

42:24.547 --> 42:26.881
Never seen him before.

42:26.916 --> 42:28.917
He's the reason your
last mission went south.

42:28.951 --> 42:30.251
What are my orders?

42:30.286 --> 42:33.020
Your orders are to kill
Chuck Bartowski.
