WELL...
I READ IT LAST NIGHT.

27:08.208 --> 27:10.000
OH, MY GOD.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.583
IT'S GONNA TURN
THIS NETWORK AROUND.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.291
OKAY.
THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.583
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT "THE OPPOSITE OF US"?

27:15.583 --> 27:16.542
UH, YEAH.

27:16.542 --> 27:18.542
AH.
IT IS SO GODDAMN GOOD!

27:18.542 --> 27:20.166
THE WRITING -- RAZOR-SHARP.

27:20.166 --> 27:21.333
THE COMEDY.

27:21.333 --> 27:22.125
FUCK!

27:22.125 --> 27:23.583
I WAS LAUGHING OUT LOUD.

27:23.583 --> 27:25.166
I NEVER LAUGH OUT LOUD.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.208
HE DOESN'T.

27:26.208 --> 27:27.583
IT'S GOT HEART.

27:27.583 --> 27:29.125
IT'S A SHOW
YOU WANT TO WATCH.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.500
I WANT TO WATCH IT
RIGHT NOW.

27:30.500 --> 27:32.291
I'M EXCITED.
YOU'RE TALKING, AND I'M EXCITED.

27:32.291 --> 27:33.959
WHO WROTE IT?

27:33.959 --> 27:35.166
UH...

27:35.166 --> 27:36.458
SEAN AND BEVERLY LINCOLN.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.041
YOU KNOW,
THE TEAM WHO DID "PUCKS."

27:38.041 --> 27:39.041
AND IT'S GOOD?

27:39.041 --> 27:40.500
I'M TELLING YOU --
IT'S NOT JUST GOOD.

27:40.500 --> 27:41.959
IT'S A HOME RUN.

27:41.959 --> 27:43.375
THIS ONE FOUND A WINNER.

27:43.375 --> 27:45.959
[ LAUGHS ] OH!

27:45.959 --> 27:47.458
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.500
BUT BEFORE WE COMMIT
TO THIS,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.083
THERE ARE A LOT
OF OTHER REALLY GREAT SCRIPTS

27:52.083 --> 27:54.750
THAT I COULD, YOU KNOW,
PULL OUT OF MY ASS.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.667
WHAT? NO!
THIS IS IT.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.291
I DON'T WANT
TO EVEN SHOOT A PILOT.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.333
I WANT TO GO
STRAIGHT TO SERIES.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.667
HOW SOON CAN THEY START?
