WEBVTT

00:10.230 --> 00:11.600
Morning.

00:11.660 --> 00:15.200
Mmm. Morning.

00:15.260 --> 00:18.030
Charlie, please don't start anything.

00:18.100 --> 00:22.030
Too late. I woke up started.

00:22.100 --> 00:25.360
I have to get to work.

00:25.430 --> 00:28.030
Okay, I've got a job for you.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.000
We'll finish this tonight.

00:31.060 --> 00:34.300
I may have to finish this myself.

00:34.360 --> 00:36.000
Knock yourself out.

00:36.060 --> 00:39.200
It's no fun if you have permission.

00:39.260 --> 00:41.200
So, Charlie, I was thinking maybe tonight

00:41.260 --> 00:42.560
we could stay at my place.

00:42.630 --> 00:46.300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.530
Charlie?

00:47.600 --> 00:49.930
I'm sorry, did you say something?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.160
I said maybe tonight we could stay at my place.

00:52.230 --> 00:55.060
You want to play on my face?

00:56.860 --> 00:59.400
Stay at my place.

01:01.260 --> 01:02.800
What about it?

01:02.860 --> 01:05.060
I've been coming here for the past three weeks,

01:05.129 --> 01:07.600
and it's like an hour drive for me to get to work.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.660
Well, I'd be happy to spring for a cab.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.630
It's not the drive, you idiot.

01:12.700 --> 01:13.900
You just said it was the drive.

01:13.960 --> 01:17.150
What I mean is if we're gonna see each other on a regular basis

01:17.150 --> 01:19.330
there should be some give and take.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.130
Based on last night, we're pretty even Steven

01:22.200 --> 01:23.860
in the give-and-take department.

01:24.700 --> 01:28.900
And if I recall correctly, you're up one "take."

01:28.960 --> 01:32.130
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the one with tennis elbow.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.230
So what about tonight?

01:37.300 --> 01:40.060
I'd love to, but it might be a little tricky.

01:40.130 --> 01:41.700
Why?

01:41.760 --> 01:43.830
Oh, I knew she'd ask me that.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.600
I'm starting to get the feeling

01:45.660 --> 01:48.100
that you only want to see at your place

01:48.160 --> 01:50.030
and at your convenience.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.660
No, of course not.

01:53.730 --> 01:56.330
Well, then fine, you'll stay at my place tonight.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.000
Sounds great.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.300
Lookin' forward to it.

好汉两个半
第六季  第七集

02:10.130 --> 02:12.030
So what do you want to do this weekend?

02:12.100 --> 02:13.830
Doesn't matter, just as long  you and I are together.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.460
What did you do?

02:20.530 --> 02:22.100
I didn't do anything.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.460
Why would you even ask me that?

02:23.530 --> 02:26.460
I'm guessing he either robbed a liquor store

02:26.530 --> 02:27.700
or killed a drifter.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.560
Do I need to call your mother and ask her?

02:31.630 --> 02:34.260
If you want to, but you know how she pushes your buttons.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.400
I'll take that chance.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.060
Fine, I don't care.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.730
All right, all right! I got thrown off the school bus.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.830
You got the spine of a gummy bear.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.290
Why were you thrown off the bus?

02:48.300 --> 02:51.900
Well, actually, it's a funny story.

02:51.960 --> 02:53.530
Amuse me.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.800
Have you ever heard of this thing called mooning?

02:57.160 --> 02:59.330
Yeah. Yeah, it rings a bell.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.200
The bus was going past the girls' track team

03:01.260 --> 03:03.430
and a bunch of us thought it'd be funny to moon them.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.660
See, she gets it.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.730
Berta.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.830
Sorry. I'm just remembering my prom.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.030
So what happened?

03:14.100 --> 03:16.360
Well, I was working near the high school that night,

03:16.430 --> 03:19.000
and I thought it would be fun to drive the backhoe...

03:19.000 --> 03:21.060
No. Not you.

03:21.130 --> 03:22.600
Him.

03:22.660 --> 03:25.730
Well. Excuse me for sharing.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.730
What happened?

03:27.800 --> 03:30.260
Well, it sounds like Berta had quite a prom.

03:30.330 --> 03:33.560
You're skating on thin ice, Jake.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.560
Boy, that's something we haven't done

03:35.560 --> 03:36.350
In a long time-- skating.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.150
Jake!

03:37.330 --> 03:39.400
Mom grounded me for two weeks.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.030
Why didn't your mother tell me about this?

03:41.100 --> 03:42.300
I promised I'd tell you.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.330
What can I say? She believed me.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.900
So how about a movie? A little father-son bonding.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.460
No, no. No movies.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.730
- Skating? - No skating.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.260
Fine.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.330
Also no TV, no video games,

03:55.400 --> 03:56.900
no cell phones, and no iPods--

03:56.960 --> 03:58.560
nothing that gives you any amusement or enjoyment.

03:58.630 --> 04:00.930
Couldn't you just smack me with a belt and get it over with?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.060
Get out of here.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.560
I'm bored.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.860
Oh, man.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.430
What's the matter?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.360
Did you know that Culver City

04:17.430 --> 04:19.130
is all the way down near the airport?

04:19.200 --> 04:21.100
Yes.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.530
That's gotta be like 45 minutes from here.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.200
If there's no traffic.

04:26.260 --> 04:27.630
Traffic?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.930
Is this Culver City place popular?

04:32.000 --> 04:35.700
Not particularly, but there are other people with cars

04:35.760 --> 04:38.600
living lives completely separate from your own.

04:38.660 --> 04:40.660
Oh, right.

04:40.730 --> 04:41.960
I hate those people.

04:42.030 --> 04:44.760
"So what's in Culver City?," he asked,

04:44.830 --> 04:46.630
knowing the only possible answer.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.100
Can you believe she wants me to schlep all the way

04:49.160 --> 04:51.700
over to her place just so we can spend the night together?

04:52.330 --> 04:53.830
Aw, you poor guy.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.960
You have to drive 45 minutes to get laid.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.600
And 45 minutes to get back.

05:03.830 --> 05:06.000
That's 90 minutes behind the wheel

05:06.060 --> 05:08.560
for 20, 30 minutes behind...

05:08.630 --> 05:10.730
Well, I don't need to draw you a map.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.760
You're breaking my heart.

05:12.830 --> 05:14.730
And it's not just that.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.060
She said there's only street parking.

05:17.130 --> 05:19.400
Which means trees.

05:19.460 --> 05:21.760
And trees have that, you know, toxic syrup

05:21.830 --> 05:24.260
that drips out of them and gets all over your car.

05:24.930 --> 05:26.900
Sap.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.340
If I make that drive, I am.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.330
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.030
You always said that it was better to go

05:33.100 --> 05:35.350
to the woman's house so that you could make a quick getaway.

05:36.190 --> 05:37.910
Yeah, for one-nighters that's fine.

05:38.180 --> 05:39.700
But this girl, I care about.

05:39.760 --> 05:42.130
We've been seeing each other for almost a month.

05:42.200 --> 05:45.100
And yet you just found out where she lives.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.930
There's a difference between caring and stalking, Alan.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.500
Hey, Dad, I need my laptop.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.130
- What for? - Homework.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.060
What homework?

05:54.130 --> 05:56.460
Um... Damn, you're good.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.160
Thanks for driving all the way over here, Charlie.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.730
Are you kidding?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.760
I would've walked here if I had to.

06:07.830 --> 06:10.930
Probably would've been faster with the traffic.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.700
Good night.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.060
Good night.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.074

06:28.660 --> 06:29.830
What are you doing?

06:29.900 --> 06:31.630
I heard a car door.

06:31.700 --> 06:33.900
Your Mercedes is fine, Charlie.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.830
I know, I know.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.330
Just double-checking.

06:40.730 --> 06:43.660
Probably gonna get sap all over the car cover.

06:43.730 --> 06:45.930
Isn't that what it's for?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.530
You don't get it. That's fine.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.630
No TV in the bedroom, huh?

06:53.700 --> 06:55.100
It's in the living room.

06:55.160 --> 06:57.000
You just got the one?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.500
How many do I need?

06:58.500 --> 07:04.100
Well, you've got three rooms and a bath, so... four.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.830
If you want to go watch television instead of cuddling,

07:06.900 --> 07:08.600
that's up to you.

07:08.660 --> 07:13.230
No, no, I'd much rather cuddle.

07:14.730 --> 07:16.860
At my house, we could do both.

07:16.930 --> 07:20.500
<i>You know, cuddling and Sportscenter.</i>

07:20.560 --> 07:22.460
Good night, Charlie.

07:22.530 --> 07:24.660
Sweet dreams.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.760
What now?

07:45.830 --> 07:49.630
Nothing. I'm just used to sleeping on the other side of the bed.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.560
Yeah, so?

07:51.630 --> 07:53.630
So I usually sleep on my left side,

07:53.700 --> 07:57.800
which faces me towards the edge of the mattress.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.960
But here, I'm facing the back of your head--which is fine;

08:01.030 --> 08:03.960
there are certainly times when I enjoy seeing it

08:04.030 --> 08:06.000
from that angle--

08:06.060 --> 08:08.760
but, you know, when I'm trying to sleep,

08:08.830 --> 08:11.160
it's a little disconcerting.

08:11.230 --> 08:14.530
Well, I'm sorry, but this is my side.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.730
But you sleep on the other side at my house.

08:17.800 --> 08:21.000
Because it's your house; this is my house.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
But I'm a guest.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.500
And I'm the guest at your house.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.300
-That's different. -How?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.800
Give me a minute.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.600
Good night, Charlie.

08:28.660 --> 08:33.429
Boy, you're being pretty inflexible.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.960
<i>Oh, you think  I'm inflexible.</i>

08:36.030 --> 08:38.200
Well, not physically,

08:38.260 --> 08:40.960
but you got to admit in this regard,

08:41.030 --> 08:43.000
you're a little stubborn.

08:43.929 --> 08:47.260
Good night, Charlie.

08:50.260 --> 08:53.530
Okay. Good night.

08:56.230 --> 08:58.900
How about this?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.630
If we switch sides and an armed intruder came in,

09:01.700 --> 09:03.500
I could leap up and protect you.

09:03.500 --> 09:07.560
But this way, you're pretty much guaranteed to catch the first bullet.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.030
What if he comes through the window?

09:13.060 --> 09:15.100
Oh, great.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.160
Now I'm never gonna get to sleep.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.160
Jake?

09:36.730 --> 09:39.230
You'd better not be watching TV.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.360
Maybe he's upstairs.

10:52.660 --> 10:56.060
It's like trying to sleep in the freaking jungle.

11:15.530 --> 11:16.930
What's going on?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.200
Nothing, nothing.

11:18.260 --> 11:21.290
I was going to the bathroom, and I stepped on a cat.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.660
You don't have to sneak out.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.460
If you want to leave, leave.

11:25.530 --> 11:28.860
Whoa, I'd say someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.630
But I don't want to revisit that topic.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.430
Good-bye, Charlie.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.560
Gee, you sound kind of angry.

11:38.630 --> 11:39.300
Why would I be angry?

11:40.360 --> 11:43.600
Just because I drive to Malibu every night for a month,

11:43.660 --> 11:45.530
and you won't stay even one night with me?

11:45.600 --> 11:49.300
Well, that and, you know, possibly crippling your cat.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.460
Go home, Charlie.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.600
Are you sure?

11:53.660 --> 11:55.260
I'm begging you.

11:55.330 --> 11:57.930
Okay, if that's what you want.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.900
So tomorrow at my place?

12:10.300 --> 12:14.630
You make love like a woman, but you throw like a man.

12:38.530 --> 12:40.290
Jake?

12:43.530 --> 12:45.290
Why are you sleeping out here?

12:45.300 --> 12:49.600
I was, um... camping?

12:51.560 --> 12:54.160
Okay, well, as long as you're not watching TV.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.830
Stupid birds.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.630
Hey, how'd it go last night?

13:06.700 --> 13:11.060
I couldn't do it, Alan. I tried, but I couldn't.

13:11.130 --> 13:13.900
Oh, well, that happens to all men occasionally.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.800
Especially when you get to be our age.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.900
What are you talking about?

13:18.930 --> 13:20.860
What are you talking about?

13:20.930 --> 13:23.260
I'm talking about how I'm so set in my ways,

13:23.330 --> 13:25.800
I couldn't spend one night in a strange house.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.630
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

13:29.260 --> 13:31.600
I mean, there was a time when I could sleep anywhere:

13:31.660 --> 13:36.660
couches, floors, witness boxes, police cars, jail cells.

13:36.730 --> 13:39.000
That's not sleeping. That's passing out.

13:39.060 --> 13:42.290
I'm not gonna argue semantics with you.

13:42.300 --> 13:46.460
The point is I was really uncomfortable over there.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.760
Even if I could have gotten to sleep,

13:48.760 --> 13:50.130
the morning would have been a disaster.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.130
How so?

13:51.200 --> 13:53.000
Think about it.

13:53.060 --> 13:54.430
After I had my morning coffee,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.660
where would I go to do my business?

13:56.730 --> 13:59.030
Oh, right, you always want

13:59.100 --> 14:00.960
to have home-field advantage for that.

14:01.030 --> 14:04.200
She's got one of those wooden toilet seats.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.300
It would've been like sitting on Pinocchio's mouth.

14:10.830 --> 14:13.930
You ever wonder about people who can poop in a gas station?

14:15.160 --> 14:16.700
What is wrong with them?

14:16.760 --> 14:18.660
What about Porta-Potties?

14:18.730 --> 14:21.760
Those aren't people. Those are animals.

14:21.830 --> 14:24.360
I'd rather go in the trunk of my car.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.230
I have.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.860
You've gone in the trunk of your car?

14:30.930 --> 14:32.800
No, yours.

14:37.930 --> 14:40.060
That was you?!

14:43.400 --> 14:46.160
I convinced myself a coyote had gotten in there.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.030
What the hell are you doing?!

15:07.100 --> 15:10.000
Playing "Smoke On the Water."

15:10.060 --> 15:11.530
With your tongue?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.930
Pretty cool, huh?

15:13.000 --> 15:15.800
No, that is not cool. It's disgusting.

15:15.860 --> 15:16.860
Alan, get in here!

15:16.930 --> 15:18.530
What now?

15:18.600 --> 15:20.630
Your kid's licking my piano.

15:20.700 --> 15:24.700
Jake, don't lick your uncle's piano.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.360
I'm bored.

15:26.430 --> 15:27.560
Go read a book.

15:27.630 --> 15:28.760
I don't want to read a book.

15:28.830 --> 15:30.100
Then go lick a book.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.430
How long is this whole grounding thing gonna go on for?

15:36.500 --> 15:37.500
Two weeks.

15:37.560 --> 15:38.660
Two weeks?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.530
Charlie, he stuck his ass out a bus window

15:40.600 --> 15:41.760
at the girls' track team.

15:41.830 --> 15:44.560
That's what you're punishing him for?

15:44.630 --> 15:47.130
When you were his age, you mooned the girls' choir.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.900
No, when I was his age, you pantsed me

15:50.960 --> 15:53.100
in front of the girls' choir.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.660
Oh, right.

15:54.730 --> 15:57.130
Well, either way, you made the yearbook.

15:59.530 --> 16:00.660
Berta, I'm leaving.

16:00.730 --> 16:01.760
Hang on!

16:01.830 --> 16:02.930
Where you going?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.560
I talked Chelsea into giving me another chance

16:04.630 --> 16:06.160
to spend the night at her place.

16:06.230 --> 16:09.030
Here's your overnight bag.

16:10.180 --> 16:11.360
Thank you.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.660
All that's for one night?

16:12.730 --> 16:16.800
One night and one morning business meeting with Pinocchio.

16:19.330 --> 16:21.130
I got your flip-flops for the shower,

16:21.200 --> 16:23.600
your personal bath towel, hand towel and washcloth,

16:23.660 --> 16:25.430
your hand soap, face soap and shampoo.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.500
Great.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.930
One handheld TV, your goose-down pillow,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.130
Egyptian cotton pillowcase and sheets

16:31.200 --> 16:33.760
and a ziplock baggie of your special blend French roast coffee.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.100
Terrific.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.100
One jar of seedless raspberry jam, a mild laxative

16:38.160 --> 16:40.830
and one roll of quilted toilet paper with lanolin.

16:43.030 --> 16:46.200
Okay.

16:46.260 --> 16:49.230
Culver City, here I come.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.560
He ain't gonna make it.

16:54.630 --> 16:56.130
Not a chance.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.430
You knowI have never once seen him eat seedless raspberry jam.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.930
That's because you've never applied a thin layer

17:04.000 --> 17:05.760
to your hindquarters.

17:12.900 --> 17:13.930
I'm so glad you decided

17:14.000 --> 17:15.460
this was important to you, Charlie.

17:15.530 --> 17:18.260
<i>Well, you're important to me.</i>

17:18.329 --> 17:20.630
What are you doing?

17:21.849 --> 17:22.950
I brought my sheets.

17:24.380 --> 17:25.819
You wanna grab the other side?

17:27.670 --> 17:28.430
What's wrong with my sheets?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.560
Nothing, nothing. But mine are better.

17:30.630 --> 17:32.860
Egyptian cotton.

17:32.930 --> 17:35.660
Like, eight-million thread count.

17:35.730 --> 17:37.460
And good news.

17:37.530 --> 17:40.630
I solved the wrong-side- of-the-bed situation.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.200
Okay...

17:42.260 --> 17:45.530
I'll just sleep with my head down there.

17:47.160 --> 17:49.830
That way, I'm facing the right way.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.030
But then your feet will be in my face.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.430
Way ahead of you.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.200
Peppermint foot lotion.

17:56.630 --> 17:59.330
You'll think you're sleepin' in Candyland.

17:59.400 --> 18:02.290
Oh, before I forget.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.660
Toilet paper?

18:04.730 --> 18:08.100
Don't get your hopes up, but I'm gonna make the effort.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.830
Hey, Jake?

18:17.030 --> 18:18.660
You out here?

18:21.430 --> 18:22.260
Seen my kid?

18:38.830 --> 18:40.530
What the hell?

18:40.600 --> 18:42.900
Can I have some privacy, please?

18:45.260 --> 18:47.740
Get out of the tub. Out of the tub.

18:48.050 --> 18:49.330
Fine.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.860
You're unbelievable. Is TV that important to you?

18:51.930 --> 18:53.800
Do you really have to ask?

18:53.860 --> 18:55.760
Go to your room.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.030
Fine, but check out Uncle Charlie's toilet seat.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.430
It heats up.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.330
Just go!

19:03.500 --> 19:04.860
Can I have this raspberry jam?

19:04.930 --> 19:07.330
Don't touch the jam!

19:20.430 --> 19:23.630
Toasty.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.430
If only I could poop at night.

19:30.260 --> 19:32.160
Maybe I'll just pee girly style.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.400
Charlie...

19:50.760 --> 19:52.360
What?

19:52.430 --> 19:53.800
This isn't working for me.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.500
My feet too minty?

19:56.560 --> 19:57.930
It's not your feet.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
<i>Well, it is your feet, but it's also the sheets,</i>

20:01.060 --> 20:03.830
the pillows, the towels, the TV, the electric toothbrush.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.460
It's not a toothbrush.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.760
It's an ultrasonic dental appliance.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.300
It's probably got more vibrations per minute

20:09.360 --> 20:11.930
than that plastic egg you keep in your nightstand.

20:13.630 --> 20:14.900
That's right.

20:14.960 --> 20:16.660
I do have one of those.

20:16.730 --> 20:17.290
Go home.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.500
But I want to spend the night here.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.060
No, no, I made a mistake.

20:22.130 --> 20:24.100
From now on, we'll stay at your place.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.000
Oh, okay.

20:26.060 --> 20:27.100
Your call.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.660
I'm nothing if not flexible.

20:34.930 --> 20:38.400
You really should put a bell on that thing.
