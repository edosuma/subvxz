Oh, lovely rising
rose stalk, Sofia.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.740
Thank you, Miss Flora.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.543
Everyone's enchanted
plants look wonderful.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.679
Some seeds here,
a little more there.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.214
That's it.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.918
Princess Kari,
your singing sunflowers

01:25.920 --> 01:28.353
are extraordinarily
enchanting.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.688
Thank you, Miss Flora.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.356
How do you get them
to do that?

01:31.358 --> 01:34.359
I figured out that they sing
higher or lower

01:34.361 --> 01:36.361
depending on how much
plant food you give them.

01:36.363 --> 01:38.530
( flowers singing )

01:38.532 --> 01:41.300
- See?
- Wow!

01:41.302 --> 01:44.236
- Excellent work, Kari.
- You guys wanna try it?

01:44.238 --> 01:45.537
I'll show you how.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.040
Oh, no!
My bouncing bluebells!

01:48.042 --> 01:49.908
They're bouncing
everywhere!

01:49.910 --> 01:51.310
Hang on.
I'll get 'em.

01:51.312 --> 01:54.646
Got it. Excuse me.
Gotcha.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.149
Wow! Kari can
really catch.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.651
I guess that's why
she was the most
valuable player

01:59.653 --> 02:01.887
in the dazzleball
tournament.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.756
Is there anything
she can't do?

02:04.758 --> 02:08.460
Probably not.
She's also captain
of the gymnastics team.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.229
And last week,
in alchemy class,

02:10.231 --> 02:13.298
she was the only student
to change chocolate into gold.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.135
Oh, children, we only
have a few minutes
left of class,

02:16.137 --> 02:19.571
so I want to share
some exciting news with you.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.106
The day after tomorrow,

02:21.108 --> 02:23.308
Royal Prep
will be hosting

02:23.310 --> 02:25.811
its very first
Arts Night.

02:25.813 --> 02:29.114
- What's an Arts Night?
- It's when your parents
come to school

02:29.116 --> 02:32.251
to see presentations
of all the artistic things

02:32.253 --> 02:33.919
we do here at
Royal Prep.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.321
Singing, dancing,
painting.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.657
There are many
presentations
to prepare,

02:38.659 --> 02:40.592
so I'll need
all of your help.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.761
Now, who would
like to put on

02:42.763 --> 02:44.763
an enchanted orchestra
performance?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.298
Oh, I would.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.434
Zoe, Cleo, Derek,
thank you.

02:49.436 --> 02:51.537
And would anyone
like to decorate

02:51.539 --> 02:53.639
the main hall with
student art work?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.607
James, Khalid.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.976
Sounds fun,
Miss Flora.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.778
Vivian. Marvelous.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.813
The next item
on my list...

03:01.815 --> 03:05.350
Will be presented by
yours truly, Miss Elodie.

03:07.787 --> 03:09.688
I need some nimble dancers
to perform

03:09.690 --> 03:12.024
a simple but
stunning ballet.

03:12.026 --> 03:13.158
Any takers?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.660
- Me!
- I'll do it.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.328
Brava, ladies.

03:16.330 --> 03:19.298
But this dance requires
three performers.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.466
Are there any other
volunteers?

03:21.468 --> 03:22.968
You should dance
with us, Kari.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.703
I've never done
ballet before.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.306
I'm surprised
to hear that, Kari.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.541
Your mother was
the star ballerina

03:29.543 --> 03:31.643
when she was a student
at Royal Prep.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.812
She was remarkable.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.814
Yeah, I know.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.549
Guess I just
never had the time to try it.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.017
Now's your chance.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.986
We can help you
learn the steps.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.654
Amber and I have
taken a few classes.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.990
And knowing you,
you'll probably be

03:44.992 --> 03:47.659
a prima ballerina
by the end of
our first rehearsal.

03:47.661 --> 03:54.099
Just like
your mother.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.367
All right.
I'll do it.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.035
Perfect.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.837
I have my three
ballerinas.

03:58.839 --> 04:01.506
Meet me in the dance studio
for practice after lunch.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.675
Be sure to give
your parents

04:03.677 --> 04:05.677
these invitations to
Arts Night.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.180
It's an event
they won't want to miss.

04:08.182 --> 04:10.749
Gather around,
budding ballerinas.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.684
Before we begin
rehearsal,

04:12.686 --> 04:14.853
let me offer you
some words of advice

04:14.855 --> 04:17.055
from my very favorite
ballet teacher,

04:17.057 --> 04:18.523
the world famous

04:18.525 --> 04:21.026
Sergio Adagio.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.228
He said, "In ballet,
you dance

04:23.230 --> 04:25.530
not just with arms
and legs,

04:25.532 --> 04:28.267
but with
a joyful heart."

04:28.269 --> 04:30.102
Now, let me show you
the routine I've choreographed

04:30.104 --> 04:31.570
for Arts Night.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.672
We will start with
a pirouette.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.776
Then an arabesque.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.211
Into a glissade.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.746
That looks tricky.

04:40.748 --> 04:43.148
And we'll end with
a grande jeté!

04:44.284 --> 04:46.118
Uh, Miss Elodie,

04:46.120 --> 04:48.754
we're supposed to learn
all those moves in two days?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.555
( laughs )
Don't worry.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.457
We'll learn it
bit by bit.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.726
Let's begin with
the first move
in our routine.

04:54.728 --> 04:55.927
The pirouette.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.596
This move is
pretty easy, Kari.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.431
You put your feet
like this,

04:59.433 --> 05:02.768
and just lift up your leg
and spin... whoa!

05:02.770 --> 05:04.736
Like that.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.505
- Only better.
- Got it.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.975
Here goes.

05:13.279 --> 05:14.446
( giggling )

05:14.448 --> 05:16.481
It's okay, Kari.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.117
It won't be long before
you're just as good as your mom.

05:19.119 --> 05:22.120
Look at her, Amber.
Her form is perfect.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.423
Okay, let me
try that again.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.628
Sorry. That wasn't
good at all.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.163
No need to apologize,
Kari.

05:33.433 --> 05:36.335
How do you do this
without getting dizzy?

05:38.604 --> 05:39.838
Kari, are you
all right?

05:39.840 --> 05:41.640
I'm okay,
I'm okay.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.241
Let me just
try it again.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.897
( bell tolling )

06:05.899 --> 06:07.466
Ooh, recess.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.701
Oh, my favorite
part of the day.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.169
Go on without me.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.404
I'm gonna stay
and work on this move.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.039
All right, Kari.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.208
But you should know,
you're doing wonderfully

06:16.210 --> 06:17.609
for your first
ballet lesson.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.085
Come on, Kari.
You can take a little break.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.520
No, not just yet.

06:28.522 --> 06:31.590
I really wanna do
a perfect pirouette.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.258
But it doesn't
have to be perfect.

06:34.694 --> 06:36.361
Yes, it does.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.829
I've gotta
keep practicing.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.631
Okay.

06:46.672 --> 06:50.542
My, Zoe, what a lovely
sculpture.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.077
Do you really like it?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.212
I made it out of
all these cool old things

06:54.214 --> 06:56.515
I found at home.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.250
It's an elephant.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.719
So it is.

07:00.721 --> 07:02.888
Very creative.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.689
Wait. Hold on.

07:04.691 --> 07:08.593
I have to add
the final touch.
There.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.797
Excellent.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.800
And here are
my hall decorators.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.635
I leave it to you
to turn this hall

07:16.637 --> 07:19.938
into an enchanting
gallery of student art.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.107
Don't forget to find
a good spot for
my sculpture.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.542
You got it.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.644
Okay, guys,
let's get to work.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.381
Um, any brilliant ideas
on where

07:29.383 --> 07:31.450
Zoe's lion sculpture
should go?

07:35.288 --> 07:37.756
That's not a lion.
It's a castle.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.792
You mean a dragon.
See all the scales?

07:41.727 --> 07:43.562
Whatever it is,

07:43.564 --> 07:45.597
let's move it over there
by the bench.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.165
( all groaning )

07:50.102 --> 07:52.137
It's so heavy.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.474
VIVIAN: Oh, no!

07:55.476 --> 07:57.075
We broke the lion.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.311
- You mean castle.
- You mean dragon.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.413
Come on, we've gotta
put it back together

08:01.415 --> 08:02.881
before Zoe sees it.

08:05.117 --> 08:08.420
Students, remember to give
your parents their invitations

08:08.422 --> 08:09.754
to Arts Night.

08:09.756 --> 08:11.790
Don't look
so worried, Kari.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.459
We still have tomorrow
and the next day to
learn the routine.

08:14.461 --> 08:16.328
I know. I just hope
it's enough time.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.129
See ya, Sofia.

08:18.131 --> 08:21.299
Kari, my little
superstar.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.268
- How was your day?
- Hi, Mom.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.636
What's that?

08:24.638 --> 08:26.104
It's nothing.
Nothing at all.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.106
But I think it has
my name on it.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.875
Let me have a look.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.377
"You are cordially invited
to Royal Prep's

08:32.379 --> 08:34.679
first annual
Arts Night."

08:34.681 --> 08:36.281
Oh, how charming.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.949
What will you be
performing, Kari?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.117
A ballet.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.852
That's wonderful!

08:40.854 --> 08:43.488
I can't wait to see you
leap and spin

08:43.490 --> 08:45.156
just like I used to.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.192
The thing is,
I haven't really

08:47.194 --> 08:50.028
gotten the hang of
leaping or spinning yet.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.664
I'm sure you're going
to make me so proud.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.399
You always do.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.104
( groans quietly )

09:02.808 --> 09:05.477
Good morning,
my prancing princesses.

09:05.479 --> 09:06.912
Ready for rehearsal?

09:06.914 --> 09:09.581
Oh, I see rehearsal's
already started.

09:09.583 --> 09:11.516
I got here early
to practice.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.752
Sofia, she's really
serious about this.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.320
Too serious.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.322
Let's try to help her
have some fun.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.559
Whoa! Uh... uh...

09:20.561 --> 09:21.660
That was great.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.728
What are you
talking about, Sofia?

09:23.730 --> 09:25.363
I totally messed up
that pirouette.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.366
But you made up
a really fun dance move instead.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.069
Let's call it
the Kari hop.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.639
Ooh, look, I can do
the Kari hop, too.

09:36.075 --> 09:37.943
Watch me!

09:37.945 --> 09:39.678
( Sofia giggling )

09:41.247 --> 09:42.681
KARI:
Okay, looks like fun.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.749
( giggles )
This is a hoot.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.185
Marvelous moves,
dancers.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.687
Very spirited.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.789
Thank you,
Miss Flora.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.291
I need to speak with
Miss Elodie for a moment,
but do carry on.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.494
Your parents are going
to just adore this.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.699
Okay, let's get
back to practice.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.034
My parents are coming
to see me do ballet,

10:03.036 --> 10:05.337
not some silly hop.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.443
Oh, I'll never
get it in time.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.378
It's okay, Kari.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.880
It's not okay.

marvelous pirouetting.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.033
Congratulations.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.568
Finally.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.503
I was starting to think
I'd never get it.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.672
Now we can start working on
the other dance moves

12:20.674 --> 12:23.041
- in the routine.
- Other dance moves?

12:23.043 --> 12:24.843
Yes. Remember?

12:24.845 --> 12:27.078
After the pirouette,
you girls will arabesque,

12:27.080 --> 12:30.081
glissade,
and then grande jeté.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.517
But it took me so long
to learn one move.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.085
How will I ever learn
all those others

12:34.087 --> 12:36.888
by tomorrow night?
There's not enough time.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.757
Sure there is.
We can do it.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.759
Maybe you and Amber can.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.527
You've taken
ballet before.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.562
But this is really
hard for me.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.698
I think you're gonna
do fine, Kari.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.533
But if you want
some extra help,

12:48.535 --> 12:51.236
I can ask my old teacher,
Sergio Adagio,

12:51.238 --> 12:53.304
to give you
a special lesson.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.639
He's the best there is.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.141
Really?
You could do that?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.542
We could invite him
to our castle.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.244
We have a big
ballroom there.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.781
Oh, Sergio will get you
dancing in no time, Kari.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.786
That's him!

13:07.788 --> 13:09.654
Sergio Adagio.

13:12.391 --> 13:14.225
( sighs )

13:14.227 --> 13:15.794
My warm-up is complete.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.896
That was just
a warm-up?

13:17.898 --> 13:19.898
We really want to thank you
for making time

13:19.900 --> 13:21.733
to do this,
Signore Adagio.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.301
So we brought
you these.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.137
It is my pleasure.
When it comes to ballet,

13:26.139 --> 13:30.074
I bend over backwards
to help a student in need.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.609
Now, my darlings,

13:31.611 --> 13:33.444
what is this dancing
emergency of yours?

13:33.446 --> 13:35.613
Our friend needs to learn
to arabesque,

13:35.615 --> 13:37.749
glissade
and grande jeté.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.484
And she needs
to learn them fast.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.753
I don't know how to do
any of those moves.

13:41.755 --> 13:44.823
I am very glad
to hear that.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.258
- You are?
- Absolutely.

13:47.260 --> 13:50.128
It means you're like
a shapeless lump of clay.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.963
A shapeless lump of clay
I can mold

13:51.965 --> 13:54.432
into a chiseled statue
of greatness.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.935
Let us begin
with a grande jeté.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.838
Like so.
Now you try.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.279
Hm. I see this will
require

14:08.281 --> 14:10.281
some special
training.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.317
I shall need something
challenging

14:12.319 --> 14:15.253
that Princess Kari
can practice
jumping over.

14:17.223 --> 14:20.191
I've still got some
enchanted plant food
from class.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.360
I can make
these bluebells bounce.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.928
Will that work?

14:25.030 --> 14:27.198
Perfectly.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.702
Now jeté over
the bluebells,
Princess Kari.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.937
Jeté like you have
never jetéd before.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.379
Oh!

14:45.651 --> 14:48.319
Stop. Wait.
Hold everything.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.021
What's wrong?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.689
That, my dear,

14:51.691 --> 14:54.392
was an absolutely
wonderful grande jeté.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.160
- Really?
- Really.

14:56.162 --> 14:58.363
Oh, I can't believe it.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.765
Now we move on to
the arabesque.

15:10.609 --> 15:13.411
Mmmm.... a noble effort.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.380
But for a proper
arabesque,

15:15.382 --> 15:18.449
you must stretch out
much further.

15:18.451 --> 15:22.287
Now, use these
to dust this table,
and this chair.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.789
Stretch your arm forward.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.091
Life your leg back.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.061
And dust, and dust.

15:30.063 --> 15:32.030
And you missed a spot.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.533
Kari, you're doing it.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.035
You're doing
an arabesque.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.270
I am.
This is fun.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.739
And now, I will teach you
the glissade.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.775
Watch how I do it.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.611
But please, hold your applause
until the end.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.888
Now glissade
to the right,

15:56.890 --> 15:58.823
and ring this bell.

16:00.259 --> 16:03.728
Now over there,
and ringy-ding ding.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.263
You're doing
great, Kari.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.765
Thanks. I'm really getting
the hang of this now.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.600
Just remember, girls.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.903
In ballet, you dance
not just with arms and legs,

16:11.905 --> 16:14.205
but with a joyful heart.

16:19.511 --> 16:21.913
JAMES: Guys. Guys,
look at this.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.348
I'm pretty sure this mop

16:23.350 --> 16:25.583
was the mane on Zoe's
lion sculpture.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.987
I'm not so sure, James.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.855
In fact, I'm not so sure

16:30.857 --> 16:32.757
that mop was even part
of the sculpture.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.460
Yeah. I think it fell
out of the janitor's closet.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.595
Oh, yeah.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.597
But I still say
it's a lion.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.666
- Castle.
- Dragon.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.634
Let's get started
right away, girls.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.303
This is our final
rehearsal

16:45.305 --> 16:47.105
before the big
show tonight.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.840
Miss Elodie,
thank you so much

16:48.842 --> 16:50.842
for setting up the lesson
with Sergio yesterday.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.343
He was amazing.

16:55.848 --> 16:59.951
My, my. You certainly learned
the way to grande jeté.

16:59.953 --> 17:02.620
I can even glissade
and arabesque.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.489
It looks like you girls
are ready to rehearse

17:04.491 --> 17:05.890
the entire routine.

17:05.892 --> 17:09.527
Remember, we start with
the pirouette.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.470
Kari, are you okay?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.973
No. I could do
a pirouette before.

17:21.975 --> 17:23.641
Why did I mess it up now?

17:23.643 --> 17:25.510
Because it takes
a lot of practice

17:25.512 --> 17:27.145
to get it right
every time.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.980
And we haven't
worked on it in a while.

17:28.982 --> 17:30.982
- Once more then.
- Okay.

17:35.521 --> 17:37.989
Let me try again.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.926
MISS ELODIE:
Very nice.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.528
This is awful!

17:43.530 --> 17:45.997
- I can't get it right.
- But you almost had it.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.199
My parents will be
watching tonight.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.867
I don't wanna
almost do it.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.004
It has to be perfect.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.673
I'm sorry. I don't think
I can be in the show.

17:55.675 --> 17:58.910
Kari.
Wait!

18:01.180 --> 18:03.214
Well, the good news is,

18:03.216 --> 18:05.550
this is definitely the best
dragon-lion-in a castle

18:05.552 --> 18:07.085
I've ever seen.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.920
But that's not
what Zoe made.

18:08.922 --> 18:11.522
Yeah. She is not
gonna be happy.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.558
( sighs )
You're right.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.294
( footsteps approaching )

18:16.296 --> 18:17.595
Uh-oh, here she comes now.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.664
Quick. Hide
the dragon-lion.

18:20.732 --> 18:24.135
Hi, guys. The hall
looks great.

18:24.137 --> 18:27.738
- Thanks.
- Uh, is that
my sculpture?

18:27.740 --> 18:29.307
- What sculpture?
- Where?

18:29.309 --> 18:30.641
I don't see
any sculpture.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.877
That one right there.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.580
What happened
to my elephant?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.982
So that's what
it was.

18:37.984 --> 18:40.718
Okay, Zoe,
the thing is,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.788
we accidentally
knocked over
your sculpture

18:43.790 --> 18:45.823
and it fell apart.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.125
So we put it
back together.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.993
The bad news is,

18:48.995 --> 18:51.496
some things might not be
in exactly the same place
as you had them.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.264
Or even close.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.199
We are really sorry.

19:02.241 --> 19:04.742
I can't believe
what you did.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.411
It looks even better
than before.

19:07.413 --> 19:08.913
It does?

19:08.915 --> 19:11.082
But it's
totally different.

19:11.084 --> 19:13.584
It doesn't matter.
Making it was
the fun part.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.086
That's true.

19:15.088 --> 19:16.787
- It was.
- Yeah.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.856
Hey, do you have
any other sculptures

19:18.858 --> 19:21.993
- you want us to mess up?
- Kari, come back!

19:21.995 --> 19:24.428
What's the point?
I just can't do it, Sofia.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.030
- Watch out.
- Stop!

19:27.799 --> 19:30.768
No! I messed up
something else.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.937
I'm ruining
Arts Night.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.806
It's okay.
Everyone makes mistakes.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.875
And we can just put
the sculpture back together.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.077
- We did it before.
- It's really fun.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.681
It's just like
with dancing.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.216
Doing it
is the fun part,

19:45.218 --> 19:46.851
even if you don't
do it perfectly.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.486
But my parents--

19:48.488 --> 19:50.988
Will see you having
a great time dancing
in the show.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.823
You think ballet's
fun, don't you?

19:52.825 --> 19:55.393
Yeah, I really do.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.361
The last few days
have been great,

19:57.363 --> 19:59.797
when I wasn't getting
all mad at myself.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.999
Then stop worrying
and just do the show

20:02.001 --> 20:04.202
- because it's fun.
- Okay. I'll do it.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.238
Great. Let's go change.

20:11.977 --> 20:15.713
Oh, I hope you all enjoyed
the art exhibit in the hall.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.550
Now, onto the next
Arts Night presentation.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.053
Ladies and gentle kings,

20:22.055 --> 20:25.389
may I present to you
Princess Sofia,

20:25.391 --> 20:27.024
Princess Amber,

20:27.026 --> 20:29.393
and Princess Kari!

20:32.664 --> 20:33.998
There's my mom and dad.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.167
Just remember
what Sergio said.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.836
In ballet, you dance not just
with arms and legs,

20:38.838 --> 20:41.372
- but with a joyful heart.
- Right.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.407
( music starts )

20:54.953 --> 20:56.621
- Kari!
- Uh-oh.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.462
She's doing the Kari hop!

21:04.464 --> 21:05.596
Let's do it, too.

21:31.456 --> 21:32.990
Oh, fabulous.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.194
Brava, girls.

21:40.666 --> 21:44.101
- Mom, Dad, I'm sorry.
- Whatever for?

21:44.103 --> 21:46.170
I made
all those mistakes.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.239
My arabesque was wobbly,

21:48.241 --> 21:50.107
I completely flubbed
my pirouette.

21:50.109 --> 21:53.010
We don't expect you
to do everything perfectly.

21:53.012 --> 21:56.180
But, Mom, you were
such an amazing ballerina.

21:56.182 --> 21:58.249
I just wanted to do
as well as you.

21:58.251 --> 22:01.752
The most important thing
is you did as well as you could.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.155
We're so proud
of you, Kari.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.823
Thanks, Mom.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.758
Kari, people are asking
if you can show them

22:07.760 --> 22:09.593
how to do
the Kari hop.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.762
Do you mean that adorable
dance move you were doing?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.331
I'd like to learn that.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.099
- Me, too.
- I'm in.

22:15.101 --> 22:18.002
Okay, just go like this
with your arms,

22:18.004 --> 22:20.104
and hop on your leg
like this.

22:20.106 --> 22:23.107
- Ooh, I'm doing it!
- Why, it is fun.

22:23.109 --> 22:26.777
( laughing )
I'm having trouble
with the Kari hop.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.280
Yes, but you invented
a new move.

22:29.282 --> 22:31.415
The Queen Tessa trot.
