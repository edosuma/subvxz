02:28.699 --> 02:31.429
<i>First stage removal.</i>

02:31.602 --> 02:35.333
<i>Streets prohibited
to non-permits in one hour.</i>

02:35.506 --> 02:39.669
<i>Streets prohibited
to non-permits in one hour.</i>

02:55.891 --> 02:58.794
<i>This conversation with
Governor Henry C. Santini...</i>

02:58.963 --> 03:03.593
<i>...is brought to you by
Soylent Red and Soylent Yellow...</i>

03:03.768 --> 03:06.168
<i>...high-energy vegetable concentrates...</i>

03:06.337 --> 03:09.306
<i>...and new, delicious Soylent Green...</i>

03:09.473 --> 03:14.741
<i>...the miracle food of high-energy plankton
gathered from the oceans of the world.</i>

03:14.913 --> 03:19.280
<i>Because of its enormous popularity,
Soylent Green is in short supply.</i>

03:19.449 --> 03:23.009
<i>Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.</i>

03:23.185 --> 03:25.517
<i>And now, Governor Santini.</i>

03:25.687 --> 03:27.517
<i>Thank you, Richard. Thank you.</i>

03:27.688 --> 03:31.524
<i>It's a pleasure to be able to talk
to the people of the city of New York.</i>

03:31.693 --> 03:33.160
Bullshit.

03:36.432 --> 03:39.230
What did you dig up
in those cases l gave you?

03:41.404 --> 03:43.065
Matthewson...

03:43.939 --> 03:45.100
...murder.

03:45.741 --> 03:49.700
Out of your jurisdiction,
across the city line in Philadelphia.

03:50.478 --> 03:52.709
Chergov, murder.

03:53.882 --> 03:55.316
Went home yesterday.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.784
Donaldson, multiple rape.

03:58.955 --> 04:00.752
Has a record in the Bronx.

04:01.724 --> 04:03.555
Can be extradited.

04:04.426 --> 04:06.223
Get him the hell out of Manhattan.

04:06.395 --> 04:08.023
What about Zolitnikoff?

04:08.199 --> 04:09.893
Well, give me time, will you?

04:10.066 --> 04:12.762
You've been telling me that
for the last three days.

04:12.935 --> 04:15.267
Well, l can't locate the files.

04:15.437 --> 04:18.269
l spent hours on it
at the Exchange today.

04:18.940 --> 04:21.067
Talked to every other book
who was there.

04:21.243 --> 04:24.836
You know, there are 20 million guys
out of work in Manhattan alone...

04:25.011 --> 04:28.072
...just waiting for my job
and yours too.

04:28.249 --> 04:30.945
l want to close that case
and sign it out.

04:31.118 --> 04:33.517
What the hell kind of miracle
do you want of me?

04:33.688 --> 04:38.090
l'm just an ordinary police book,
not the Library of Congress.

04:39.160 --> 04:40.922
l don't know why l bother.

04:41.094 --> 04:44.552
Because it's your job.
Besides, you love me.

04:48.537 --> 04:52.098
-That margarine's turned.
-Son of a bitch.

04:53.943 --> 04:58.105
Zolitnikoff, no record.
Matthewson, no jurisdiction.

04:58.279 --> 05:04.479
Chergov, home.
And Donaldson, extradite.

05:04.819 --> 05:06.878
Why don't you eat something?

05:07.388 --> 05:10.686
-l'm not hungry enough yet.
-lt's not bad.

05:11.658 --> 05:14.923
Tasteless, odorless crud.

05:17.631 --> 05:20.157
You don't know any better.

05:23.803 --> 05:25.134
Oh, for--

05:26.741 --> 05:29.175
You know, when l was a kid...

05:29.343 --> 05:31.036
...food was food.

05:31.810 --> 05:36.509
Before our scientific magicians
poisoned the water...

05:37.383 --> 05:41.080
...polluted the soil,
decimated plant and animal life.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.156
Why, in my day,
you could buy meat anywhere.

05:44.325 --> 05:47.783
Eggs, they had. Real butter.
Fresh lettuce in the stores.

05:47.962 --> 05:49.896
l know, Sol. You told me before.

05:50.064 --> 05:52.555
How can anything survive
in a climate like this?

05:52.734 --> 05:54.724
A heat wave all year long.

05:54.902 --> 05:59.099
A greenhouse effect.
Everything is burning up.

06:00.041 --> 06:02.133
Okay, wise guy.

06:16.155 --> 06:18.988
Eat some Soylent Green and calm down.

06:19.158 --> 06:22.650
l finished it last night.
l was hungry, damn it.

06:22.828 --> 06:26.628
-l'll hustle some more on Tuesday.
-You do that.

06:26.799 --> 06:29.062
l don't want to get caught
in another riot.

06:29.233 --> 06:31.861
Get off. l'll charge up
the batteries before l go.

06:32.537 --> 06:36.438
-You'll get a heart attack.
-l should be so lucky.

06:36.841 --> 06:39.640
l've pedaled this damn thing
halfway around the world.

06:39.812 --> 06:42.178
You know, l'm getting pretty sick of you.

06:42.681 --> 06:44.444
Yes, but you love me.

06:45.952 --> 06:49.512
Night shift again. l'll be damn late.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.514
So get something to eat.

06:54.293 --> 06:58.286
-What?
-Go with God.

06:58.464 --> 06:59.953
Schmuck.

07:21.118 --> 07:22.278
Gilbert?

07:23.219 --> 07:24.779
Hey, Mr. Donovan.

07:24.956 --> 07:26.946
l have something for you.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.887
Get inside.

07:29.059 --> 07:30.389
Great.

07:48.211 --> 07:50.042
Handmade, isn't that?

07:53.450 --> 07:55.179
Do you have the words straight?

07:55.352 --> 07:58.948
-l won't understand them if l live to be 1 00.
-You won't.

07:59.923 --> 08:02.357
Okay.

08:05.463 --> 08:06.827
There!

08:17.540 --> 08:19.531
lt's good to hear you laugh.

08:19.709 --> 08:21.836
-Come on and play.
-No, thank you.

08:22.677 --> 08:26.580
-Thank you for the toy.
-l'm glad it amuses you.

08:31.390 --> 08:32.879
Let me do something for you.

08:33.424 --> 08:36.051
Are you ready, Miss Shirl?
lt's getting late.

08:37.193 --> 08:38.219
Go ahead.

08:38.395 --> 08:41.124
According to the inventory,
we're low on everything.

08:41.298 --> 08:44.996
Okay, but l'm gonna bring you
a surprise.

08:49.071 --> 08:53.405
-l demolished five saucers with one rocket.
-Not bad for an amateur.

08:54.043 --> 08:57.945
-l've got your curfew pass.
-Oh, good. l thought l'd lost it.

09:10.892 --> 09:15.261
That makes it 279 D's and 1 5 cents.

09:15.730 --> 09:19.064
Call it 279 D's even for Mr. Simonson.

09:19.235 --> 09:20.791
Sign it, Brady.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.470
Mr. Brady?

09:24.707 --> 09:27.301
Think l forgot? l didn't forget.

09:27.476 --> 09:31.673
You asked for something special,
and l got it. Come on over here.

09:36.719 --> 09:41.655
How often can l offer a customer
something really fantastic?

09:41.823 --> 09:43.348
Look.

09:44.193 --> 09:45.956
Beef, Miss Shirl.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.961
Beef like you've never seen before.

11:25.791 --> 11:27.191
What do you want?

11:29.997 --> 11:32.520
You, Mr. Simonson.

11:35.468 --> 11:36.731
l knew soon.

11:42.340 --> 11:46.834
They told me to say
that they were sorry...

11:47.012 --> 11:49.572
...but that you had become unreliable.

11:54.987 --> 11:56.351
That's true.

11:56.521 --> 12:01.255
They can't risk a catastrophe, they say.

12:01.994 --> 12:03.460
They're right.

12:05.729 --> 12:07.219
Then...

12:08.532 --> 12:10.434
...this is right?

12:11.170 --> 12:12.966
No, not right.

12:14.674 --> 12:15.970
Necessary.

12:17.176 --> 12:18.665
To who?

12:21.414 --> 12:23.540
To God.

12:40.665 --> 12:44.623
l made the routine check.
He was alive at 1 0:35.

12:44.802 --> 12:46.701
-What was your name again?
-Charles.

12:46.870 --> 12:49.771
-Charles what?
-Just Charles.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.374
lt's perfectly legal.

12:54.044 --> 12:57.206
God, we haven't had any trouble here
in years, not years.

12:58.315 --> 13:01.750
The scanners and alarms
went out of order last Thursday.

13:01.918 --> 13:04.855
-Come on. Let's have a look.
-Yes, it was Thursday.

13:05.023 --> 13:06.182
The problem is parts.

13:06.357 --> 13:10.725
The original manufacturer's out of business.
Our men fabricate replacements.

13:10.893 --> 13:13.886
Takes them forever, just forever.

13:14.064 --> 13:17.692
Nothing works, not really.
You can't believe the problems l have.

13:19.303 --> 13:21.272
l'll have to tell the other tenants.

13:21.439 --> 13:25.431
What do l do? Call each of them and say
Mr. Simonson in 22A was slaughtered?

13:25.609 --> 13:27.769
Unit scanner and alarm,
the best there is.

13:27.945 --> 13:29.377
We should have more guards.

13:29.545 --> 13:31.740
-l told management--
-Wait.

13:32.715 --> 13:34.182
We should have more guards.

13:35.586 --> 13:38.383
Detective Thorn, 1 4th Precinct.

13:39.288 --> 13:42.814
Tab Fielding.
l was Mr. Simonson's bodyguard.

13:43.825 --> 13:45.417
Furniture?

13:45.594 --> 13:47.619
-Yes.
-Simonson's?

13:48.264 --> 13:51.130
-Personal or building?
-Building.

13:51.768 --> 13:54.360
-Where's Simonson?
-ln the living room.

13:55.570 --> 13:56.934
Let's go.

14:07.117 --> 14:10.779
-What was his full name?
-William R. Simonson.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.486
Occupation?

14:17.826 --> 14:20.158
-Rich.
-Rich what?

14:20.328 --> 14:22.353
Lawyer. Politics.

14:22.531 --> 14:25.660
l had the impression
he was more or less retired.

14:27.369 --> 14:30.929
Say, does this building
have a food inventory?

14:31.105 --> 14:32.335
Yes, sir.

14:32.675 --> 14:34.369
Wouldn't you know?

14:39.115 --> 14:40.513
Get me some booze.

14:40.682 --> 14:43.344
-l don't think that's within your jurisdiction--
-Relax.

14:43.518 --> 14:45.679
You're not working for him anymore.

14:45.854 --> 14:47.912
Your contract's been canceled.

14:48.089 --> 14:50.454
l've been paid to the end
of the month.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.086
Get the bottle.

15:03.939 --> 15:06.534
Your boss didn't put up much of a fight.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.539
He wasn't the type.

15:12.814 --> 15:16.477
-Most people like to live.
-lf you say so.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.442
You're a dream.

15:19.221 --> 15:21.653
Bourbon! Son of a--

15:29.663 --> 15:33.121
Where were you, bodyguard,
when they were butchering your boss?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.267
-He sent us out shopping--
-Us?

15:35.902 --> 15:38.427
The girl and l. You know, Shirl.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.335
So?

15:44.511 --> 15:48.913
Well, we got back at 1 1 . l saw
the jimmy marks on the door and ran in...

15:49.081 --> 15:50.779
...but obviously it was--

15:59.059 --> 16:01.323
You know how to write?

16:01.495 --> 16:03.326
Yes.

16:03.497 --> 16:06.523
Why don't you go in the foyer
and write me a statement.

16:06.700 --> 16:10.430
lnclude all your movements
tonight and yesterday...

16:10.604 --> 16:13.437
...and your employment number. Okay?

16:13.607 --> 16:15.198
Okay.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.502
He'd be alive if we hadn't gone out.

17:23.674 --> 17:27.838
Now, you have nothing to regret.
He told us to go.

17:28.012 --> 17:30.675
l think he wanted to die.

17:31.016 --> 17:35.542
lt was a stupid, amateur burglar.
Nobody's fault, Shirl.

17:37.521 --> 17:40.685
Honey, it wasn't anybody's fault.

17:41.493 --> 17:42.688
Working on your report?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.830
-l was just trying to--
-Yeah, l know.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.332
Hey, what's your name? Shirl?

17:48.767 --> 17:49.994
Yes.

17:50.167 --> 17:52.159
Come on in here a minute, Shirl.

17:53.004 --> 17:54.370
Come on.

17:56.508 --> 17:58.066
Shut the door.

18:07.083 --> 18:09.018
Let's see your hands.

18:14.024 --> 18:16.686
How many times you been
in trouble with the police?

18:16.860 --> 18:18.191
-Never.
-l can't hear you.

18:18.361 --> 18:19.657
Never!

18:20.562 --> 18:22.394
No fresh bruises.

18:22.565 --> 18:25.659
He didn't knock you around, huh?
You're a lucky girl.

18:25.835 --> 18:28.737
-He never hit me.
-What?

18:28.905 --> 18:32.500
He was a gentle man.
He never abused me.

18:33.176 --> 18:34.871
l wished he'd lived forever.

18:35.045 --> 18:37.447
-Unless you were fooling around.
-No.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.015
-With the bodyguard maybe?
-No, l'm straight.

18:40.184 --> 18:41.776
Ask Charles. l don't cheat.

18:42.786 --> 18:43.912
Come on.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.349
l'd never risk my job.

18:47.156 --> 18:49.285
When you came back,
did you see the body?

18:49.459 --> 18:50.926
Just for a moment.

18:51.094 --> 18:54.426
-Was it like it is now?
-Yes, like it is.

18:58.134 --> 18:59.123
Yeah?

18:59.302 --> 19:03.000
-Sanitation squad is here, detective.
-Just a minute.

19:06.076 --> 19:08.236
What's your arrangement here?

19:08.411 --> 19:11.503
l stay for the next tenant,
if he wants me.

19:12.714 --> 19:14.511
l may have to see you again.

19:15.484 --> 19:16.973
All right.

19:18.152 --> 19:21.350
Okay, Shirl. That's all.

19:36.573 --> 19:39.064
Thorn, l thought they had you
on riot control.

19:39.242 --> 19:40.401
That's right, Wagner.

19:40.576 --> 19:44.035
-Hatcher's got you working a double shift?
-Me and everybody else.

19:44.213 --> 19:46.010
-No wonder you look lousy.
-Thanks.

19:46.181 --> 19:50.208
-How do you want him marked?
-Simonson. Murder. Dispose.

19:50.386 --> 19:53.912
-They're full up at waste disposal.
-So check dispatch.

19:54.089 --> 19:55.818
Here. You better sign for him.

20:01.095 --> 20:03.723
-My usual cut?
-You'll get your cut.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.025
Just so we understand.

20:19.279 --> 20:21.110
Where are they taking him?

20:21.281 --> 20:23.909
-What's the difference?
-Tell me, please.

20:24.551 --> 20:29.320
He'll be driven outside the city
to a waste disposal plant.

20:30.691 --> 20:33.285
When my grandmother died...

20:33.461 --> 20:35.759
...there was a ceremony.

20:36.465 --> 20:38.728
-l remember.
-l know.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.798
You got your report?

20:45.840 --> 20:48.741
What about the death benefit?

20:48.910 --> 20:51.469
We hold it, pending next of kin.

20:51.645 --> 20:54.205
There is no next of kin.

20:54.381 --> 20:57.043
You can file a claim in 30 days.

20:57.217 --> 20:58.808
l was thinking of Shirl.

20:58.984 --> 21:01.351
Sure you were.

21:04.957 --> 21:06.620
Hey, Wagner!

21:06.793 --> 21:08.818
Give me a lift home?

21:52.472 --> 21:54.531
Hey, Sol!

21:56.808 --> 21:58.969
What are you doing home?

21:59.144 --> 22:01.237
What time is it?

22:04.182 --> 22:05.810
Paper.

22:06.085 --> 22:09.485
-New paper.
-Have some pencils.

22:11.890 --> 22:14.757
Did you ever see
a cake of soap that big?

22:16.762 --> 22:20.995
Courtesy of your next assignment,
William R. Simonson.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.396
Chelsea Towers West.

22:25.472 --> 22:28.872
''Soylent Oceanographic
Survey Report...

22:29.041 --> 22:31.976
...201 5 to 201 9.''

22:33.778 --> 22:35.644
Two volumes.

22:38.250 --> 22:41.116
-Where in hell did you get all these?
-Off his shelves.

22:41.286 --> 22:44.049
The only reference books he had.
You like them?

22:44.222 --> 22:45.814
l love them.

22:46.691 --> 22:50.126
Do you know how many books
were published once upon a time?

22:50.294 --> 22:53.856
When there was paper and power
and presses that worked and--

22:56.501 --> 22:58.265
What the hell?

22:58.970 --> 23:01.064
Oh, my God.

23:03.407 --> 23:05.534
This Simonson was a great man.

23:20.925 --> 23:22.756
Love apple.

23:26.065 --> 23:28.556
lsn't that beautiful?

23:29.133 --> 23:30.464
Sol.

23:35.738 --> 23:37.639
Beef?

23:42.645 --> 23:44.841
Oh, my God.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.686
How did we come to this?

24:00.463 --> 24:04.058
Why the hell don't you get out of here?
Go back to your foolish work.

24:04.233 --> 24:07.328
Come on, Sol. Don't take it so big.

24:08.270 --> 24:10.135
Look, we're doing okay.

24:10.306 --> 24:11.969
We're doing fine.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.509
We're doing lousy...

24:15.212 --> 24:16.803
...just like when l was a boy.

24:17.381 --> 24:19.679
Nobody cares. Nobody tries...

24:19.850 --> 24:21.817
...including me.

24:24.453 --> 24:26.751
l should have gone home long ago.

24:27.223 --> 24:29.020
Come on. l need you.

24:31.527 --> 24:34.087
Simonson, William R.

24:44.773 --> 24:47.867
Number AC X21 67D.

24:48.043 --> 24:52.480
-200 D's cash or 250 in food coupons?
-Cash, please.

24:52.914 --> 24:56.371
<i>Death benefits, line up
at tables one and two.</i>

24:58.185 --> 25:02.647
<i>Death benefits, line up
at tables one and two.</i>

25:03.427 --> 25:06.487
Hey, Callahan, busy house tonight, huh?

25:06.663 --> 25:10.258
So we'll double up the Tuesday
riot detail here at 62nd tomorrow.

25:10.434 --> 25:14.027
That'll leave us thin up here at 1 01 st,
so we'll back up with scoops there.

25:14.202 --> 25:15.692
Got that?

25:30.218 --> 25:32.378
So you finally made it.

25:33.154 --> 25:37.090
-Do you know what time it is?
-You tell me. You're the one with a watch.

25:37.258 --> 25:40.694
l can't. The damn thing won't run.

25:40.862 --> 25:43.728
Let me see it. Maybe l can fix it again.

25:44.565 --> 25:46.259
Okay.

25:51.437 --> 25:53.598
Oh, let's see. The Matthewson murder....

25:53.773 --> 25:56.241
He's in Philadelphia,
out of our jurisdiction.

25:56.410 --> 25:57.878
His wife's been lying.

25:58.046 --> 26:01.777
We'll pick her up if we can find her.
Here. Sign.

26:02.383 --> 26:03.749
Zolitnikoff.

26:04.419 --> 26:05.716
l'm working on it.

26:06.489 --> 26:09.684
Which means you still
haven't got a damn thing.

26:12.926 --> 26:15.395
How old is Sol Roth now?

26:18.098 --> 26:19.792
He's doing all right.

26:19.967 --> 26:21.297
He's had it.

26:22.136 --> 26:24.366
lt's time for you to get another book.

26:24.538 --> 26:27.006
-l'll make arrangements.
-No.

26:27.507 --> 26:30.032
-Sooner or later.
-Not now.

26:30.210 --> 26:32.234
Well, it's your job.

26:37.450 --> 26:38.439
Simonson.

26:38.617 --> 26:43.681
Supposed to look like he was killed when he
caught some punk burglarizing his apartment.

26:43.856 --> 26:47.791
-Well, what do you say?
-lt was an assassination.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.188
Just like that?

26:49.362 --> 26:53.093
One: The alarm system was out of order
for the first time in two years.

26:53.266 --> 26:55.895
Two: The bodyguard was
conveniently out shopping.

26:56.069 --> 26:59.629
Three: The punk didn't take anything.
And four: The punk was no punk.

26:59.806 --> 27:03.640
He used a meat hook instead of a gun
to make it look like a punk.

27:03.810 --> 27:07.439
-What did you take?
-Everything l could lay my hands on.

27:09.282 --> 27:12.308
Well, what's for Mother?

27:16.522 --> 27:20.252
One bill for me, 50 for Kulozik,
50 for you.

27:20.660 --> 27:22.821
Ten for Wagner from your end.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.865
-Simonson must have been big.
-How big?

27:39.643 --> 27:42.340
Enough for Chelsea Towers West.

27:42.514 --> 27:45.880
-Who did the inside work?
-For my money, it's the bodyguard.

27:47.654 --> 27:51.784
-What about the furniture?
-Like grapefruit.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.953
You never saw a grapefruit.

27:55.661 --> 27:57.218
You never saw her.

27:58.063 --> 27:59.996
Come on. Shove.

28:01.499 --> 28:04.092
-You know what l really think, lieutenant?
-What?

28:04.268 --> 28:06.600
l think it's really busted this time.

28:34.197 --> 28:39.294
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybean!

28:52.516 --> 28:57.249
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybean!

29:38.695 --> 29:41.289
Watch where the hell you're stepping!

29:53.576 --> 29:55.566
What may l do for you, sir?

29:55.745 --> 29:58.907
Thorn, 1 4th Precinct.

29:59.483 --> 30:01.643
We run a clean building here, Mr. Thorn.

30:01.818 --> 30:05.480
-l want to see Tab Fielding.
-Second floor to the right.

30:26.208 --> 30:28.698
-Who's there?
-Police.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.340
Just a minute.

30:37.619 --> 30:39.611
l'm not dressed!

30:46.995 --> 30:49.258
Let me see your badge.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.727
Open up.

30:50.998 --> 30:52.432
All right.

30:57.571 --> 30:59.436
Detective Thorn, 1 4th Precinct.

30:59.606 --> 31:02.575
Sorry to make such a racket.
l want to see Mr. Fielding.

31:02.742 --> 31:04.266
He isn't home.

31:04.444 --> 31:08.245
-You Mrs. Fielding?
-l'm Martha Phillips. l live here.

31:08.416 --> 31:11.852
l just met Tab yesterday
in connection with a case.

31:12.019 --> 31:14.510
l had a few more questions
l wanted to ask him.

31:14.687 --> 31:17.520
-Would you know where he is now?
-No.

31:19.025 --> 31:20.993
When will he be back?

31:21.161 --> 31:23.789
l don't know. He just left.

31:23.963 --> 31:25.327
Swell.

31:25.864 --> 31:27.058
New furniture?

31:27.232 --> 31:29.827
-l've been with him for four years.
-Furniture?

31:30.771 --> 31:32.170
Yes.

31:32.339 --> 31:35.001
Hey, this is really a terrific place.

31:36.776 --> 31:38.768
That's rice.

31:38.946 --> 31:40.914
Yeah, l've seen it before.

31:41.849 --> 31:44.250
Tab does pretty well for himself,
doesn't he?

31:44.419 --> 31:47.648
-He's got a good reputation.
-Who with?

31:47.821 --> 31:50.585
-The people he works for.
-Who's that?

31:50.757 --> 31:52.485
You know, Chelsea West.

31:52.658 --> 31:56.889
Yeah. Well, when he gets back,
tell him Detective Thorn was here. Okay?

31:57.061 --> 31:58.291
Anything you say.

32:08.340 --> 32:10.274
Come on in here a minute, will you?

32:10.443 --> 32:11.842
Sure.

32:16.215 --> 32:19.082
l haven't seen an incinerator for years.

32:19.951 --> 32:23.147
-Used it lately?
-No, it doesn't work.

32:24.125 --> 32:25.853
What does?

32:27.827 --> 32:31.854
Really a nice place you got here.
Really nice.

32:33.166 --> 32:36.532
Plenty of room to move around.

32:36.702 --> 32:37.830
Yeah.

32:38.004 --> 32:40.631
We were very lucky to get it.

32:40.974 --> 32:44.740
Sorry l had to bust in like this. You know?
Just routine.

32:45.744 --> 32:48.474
-l haven't been very nice.
-You're just fine.

32:48.647 --> 32:51.673
l should have offered you something,
Mr. Thorn.

32:54.084 --> 32:57.077
lf l'd had the time,
l would've asked for it.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.727
Son of a bitch.

35:26.034 --> 35:28.663
l haven't eaten like this in years.

35:29.738 --> 35:31.228
l never ate like this.

35:31.407 --> 35:33.568
And now you know
what you've been missing.

35:33.742 --> 35:36.939
-There was a world once, you punk.
-Yes. So you keep telling me.

35:37.112 --> 35:38.975
l was there. l can prove it.

35:41.549 --> 35:44.541
l know. l know.

35:44.719 --> 35:47.779
When you were young,
people were better.

35:47.954 --> 35:52.118
Oh, nuts. People were always rotten.

35:52.792 --> 35:55.091
But the world was beautiful.

35:57.731 --> 35:59.561
lt's late.

36:00.568 --> 36:02.467
l gotta get to work.

36:02.636 --> 36:04.868
What have you dug up on Simonson?

36:05.040 --> 36:07.839
l've got a handful of reference work
20 years out of date.

36:08.011 --> 36:10.478
You throw out a name
and you expect a miracle.

36:10.646 --> 36:13.739
Simonson, Sol. Report, huh?

36:13.915 --> 36:15.177
Schmuck.

36:16.483 --> 36:21.478
Biographical survey, 2006.
Last one they published.

36:22.422 --> 36:26.153
Simonson, William R.

36:26.928 --> 36:29.691
Born 1 954.

36:29.863 --> 36:32.093
Evidently unmarried.

36:32.265 --> 36:35.702
Graduated Yale Law School in 1 977.

36:35.870 --> 36:40.602
Principal partner, Simonson, Borden
and Santini.

36:40.774 --> 36:44.834
-Governor Santini?
-Hold still. There's more.

36:45.844 --> 36:52.113
ln 1 997, he was the director
of Holcox Manufacturing, Norfolk, Virginia.

36:52.283 --> 36:58.280
Specialist in manufacturing freeze-drying
equipment for commercial food processing.

36:59.457 --> 37:03.691
And in 201 8...

37:03.864 --> 37:06.025
...Holcox was acquired by Soylent...

37:06.299 --> 37:08.699
...and Simonson became
a member of the board.

37:08.869 --> 37:11.133
The board of Soylent?

37:11.304 --> 37:14.638
Your dead one was a very important man.

37:14.809 --> 37:17.708
Soylent controls the food supply
for half the world.

37:17.877 --> 37:22.075
-What about those?
-Oh, very technical and highly classified.

37:22.248 --> 37:25.376
Unnumbered copies.
Officially, they don't exist.

37:25.551 --> 37:26.779
Perfect.

37:26.952 --> 37:28.817
-What else do you want?
-Everything.

37:28.988 --> 37:34.152
Well, law, Soylent, oceanography--?

37:34.326 --> 37:35.952
Across the board.

37:36.127 --> 37:37.822
Across--? Oh, that's impossible.

37:37.996 --> 37:40.556
Check the Exchange.

37:41.333 --> 37:45.564
Check the Exchange.
l need you to tell me that?

37:45.738 --> 37:49.502
You know, l was a teacher once,
a full professor, a respected man.

37:49.673 --> 37:54.167
Make a special effort, will you, Sol?
This case is for real, for a lot of marbles.

37:54.344 --> 37:56.008
-For who?
-Never mind.

37:56.182 --> 38:00.845
-Don't forget to pick up the water ration.
-l'll do that. l'll die if l don't get water.

38:05.256 --> 38:06.656
-Taste that.
-Taste what?

38:06.826 --> 38:08.817
Taste it.

38:14.767 --> 38:16.859
Strawberries?

38:17.035 --> 38:21.200
Hundred and fifty bucks a jar
of strawberries.

39:11.088 --> 39:12.750
Thorn.

39:12.924 --> 39:17.758
lD is RC1 05.

39:17.928 --> 39:20.590
Get me the 1 4th Precinct.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.900
Thorn, how about paying us a visit?

39:25.068 --> 39:27.694
l can't. l'm following up
the Simonson thing.

39:28.169 --> 39:32.004
-Well, what have you got?
-For openers, he was a director of Soylent.

39:32.775 --> 39:36.438
-What else?
-Well, right now, somebody's tailing me.

39:36.612 --> 39:38.011
He's damn good at it.

39:38.614 --> 39:39.911
Big deal.

39:41.284 --> 39:46.348
Would you believe bodyguards
are buying strawberries for 1 50 D's a jar?

39:47.457 --> 39:49.516
You'd better report in here right away.

39:49.693 --> 39:52.787
Yes, sir, first thing in the morning.

39:55.798 --> 39:57.460
That was Thorn.

39:57.634 --> 39:58.965
He's a damn good cop.

39:59.136 --> 40:01.126
Appreciate the difficulty, Ed.

40:01.304 --> 40:05.536
But the department wants to cooperate
with the governor's office, right?

40:05.708 --> 40:08.142
Whatever you say, sir.

40:15.383 --> 40:20.151
lt looks like a fair-complected man,
maybe someone close to you, a protector.

40:20.322 --> 40:23.622
And if we refer back
to this card back here...

40:23.793 --> 40:27.728
...and if you look at it, the time sequence
indicates a three-month period.

40:27.896 --> 40:30.832
The cards indicate a secure trend
should follow shortly.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.900
So things are looking up a bit, Kathy.

40:55.590 --> 40:57.684
Thank you.

41:00.696 --> 41:03.722
-Your hair looks beautiful.
-Thank you.

41:13.774 --> 41:15.036
Who is it?

41:15.208 --> 41:18.110
Thorn. Detective Thorn.

41:21.281 --> 41:25.047
l had a few more questions
l wanted to ask.

41:31.724 --> 41:33.055
Having a party?

41:33.226 --> 41:35.626
Just my friends.

41:38.566 --> 41:40.499
lt's okay.

41:41.902 --> 41:43.894
lce.

41:44.072 --> 41:46.471
Jeez.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.904
That's great.

41:58.818 --> 42:01.753
lt's still over 90 out there.

42:16.436 --> 42:20.930
You know, if l had the money,
l'd smoke two, three of these every day.

42:23.675 --> 42:25.939
Come on in here.

42:39.359 --> 42:41.954
On the bed.

42:44.298 --> 42:50.292
This is a nice place,
the way it's fixed up.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.196
Perfume.

42:56.641 --> 42:59.041
He was murdered, you know.
Assassinated.

42:59.211 --> 43:01.874
Robbery had nothing to do with it.

43:03.381 --> 43:04.974
You understand?

43:05.150 --> 43:07.141
Yes.

43:07.485 --> 43:11.217
-Did he have any relatives?
-l never heard of any.

43:11.389 --> 43:13.983
-Do you know who he worked for?
-No.

43:14.159 --> 43:18.151
-You were with him for three years.
-He never talked about his work.

43:18.329 --> 43:20.455
Did you meet his friends?

43:20.997 --> 43:23.091
Sure, l met some of his friends.

43:23.333 --> 43:24.698
What were their names?

43:25.002 --> 43:29.031
-l was never really introduced, you know.
-Oh, come on, Shirl.

43:30.242 --> 43:33.507
Well, there was a Mr. Lempeter...

43:33.678 --> 43:36.671
...a man called Tompkins...

43:36.849 --> 43:39.408
...and somebody called Santini.

43:41.086 --> 43:43.247
That's all l remember.

43:43.421 --> 43:46.412
He didn't bring people up here
very often.

43:48.927 --> 43:51.359
Santini's the governor.

43:51.828 --> 43:53.693
So?

43:55.032 --> 43:57.761
Where did you go with Simonson?

43:59.603 --> 44:01.867
No place.

44:03.541 --> 44:06.271
Shopping once in a while.

44:06.811 --> 44:08.505
-Except--
-Except?

44:08.846 --> 44:10.506
He took me to church.

44:10.880 --> 44:12.142
Church?

44:13.049 --> 44:16.314
About a month ago, and then again
a few days before he died.

44:17.187 --> 44:19.382
What did he do there?

44:19.556 --> 44:21.788
He prayed.

44:21.960 --> 44:24.826
And he talked to a priest.

44:24.995 --> 44:26.155
That's about all.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.266
-Why would he take you to church?
-He didn't say.

44:29.467 --> 44:31.730
Why do you think?

44:31.969 --> 44:35.404
l think he just wanted
to have somebody along.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.034
He was very strange towards the end.

44:39.209 --> 44:43.237
He didn't touch me for months.

44:44.647 --> 44:48.481
And sometimes for no reason at all,
he'd start to cry.

44:48.651 --> 44:50.846
l saw him cry more than once.

44:52.422 --> 44:55.050
Old people do that.

44:55.225 --> 44:56.817
Do they?

44:58.126 --> 45:01.027
l can't figure this Simonson.

45:01.663 --> 45:07.101
lf l was like him, rich, important...

45:07.769 --> 45:09.930
...plenty to eat...

45:10.472 --> 45:12.666
...real bourbon...

45:12.942 --> 45:14.374
...and a girl like you...

45:15.244 --> 45:18.112
...you wouldn't see me in church.

45:20.951 --> 45:22.213
What are you doing here?

45:22.385 --> 45:26.947
l've been looking all over the building
for you. l'll teach you to break my rules!

45:27.123 --> 45:29.612
Furniture stays in units!

45:29.791 --> 45:32.783
l've told you before.

45:33.630 --> 45:35.961
-No!
-l mean it!

45:36.130 --> 45:38.530
-l'll get rid of the whole--
-Hold it!

45:44.306 --> 45:47.037
l didn't know you were here, Mr. Thorn.

45:51.480 --> 45:54.142
We give them a day off a month.
We don't have to.

45:54.316 --> 45:57.375
And they break every regulation
in the book.

46:05.225 --> 46:08.956
You'd think they'd be grateful
for what they've got here. Wouldn't you?

46:11.331 --> 46:13.564
l'll tell you, Charlie...

46:14.170 --> 46:16.729
...they're here because l called them
for questioning.

46:18.073 --> 46:21.065
-ls that so?
-Yeah.

46:21.343 --> 46:24.073
Don't you believe me, Charlie?

46:27.182 --> 46:28.615
You should have told me.

46:28.849 --> 46:30.579
Why?

46:30.752 --> 46:33.016
Regulations.

46:33.587 --> 46:36.214
You wanna file a complaint?

46:40.360 --> 46:42.521
What do you say, Charlie?

46:44.332 --> 46:46.356
No.

46:46.533 --> 46:51.266
l don't want to do anything unfriendly
like that, Mr. Thorn.

46:52.939 --> 46:57.204
l wonder if any of these girls
want to file a complaint against you.

46:59.279 --> 47:01.440
Maybe not.

47:01.781 --> 47:04.717
Maybe they want to keep it friendly.

47:05.219 --> 47:07.279
l hope so.

47:07.623 --> 47:09.986
Don't you, Charlie?

47:11.926 --> 47:14.120
Don't you?

47:14.561 --> 47:16.392
Yes.

47:16.795 --> 47:18.321
Get the hell out of here.

47:32.246 --> 47:35.874
Look, maybe we better all go.
Come on.

47:36.049 --> 47:37.481
Come on.

47:37.649 --> 47:39.981
Come on, baby.

47:56.534 --> 47:59.436
Charles isn't as bad as some.

47:59.605 --> 48:01.333
Don't you ever get mad?

48:01.507 --> 48:03.601
What for?

48:09.948 --> 48:13.850
l left my stuff in here.

48:14.352 --> 48:16.286
lt's still dark.

48:16.454 --> 48:19.015
You could stay a while.

48:19.191 --> 48:21.317
You could wash up.

48:21.627 --> 48:22.992
l'll make you breakfast.

48:24.029 --> 48:25.462
Why should you?

48:25.631 --> 48:28.623
There's plenty of food
in the refrigerator.

48:29.301 --> 48:32.531
Charles wouldn't dare make trouble
for you now.

48:35.873 --> 48:37.864
l got work.

48:39.210 --> 48:41.803
l don't wanna be alone.

48:43.549 --> 48:46.210
l'm frightened when l'm alone.

48:46.883 --> 48:49.978
There's nothing l can do for you,
furniture.

48:50.154 --> 48:51.985
l got nothing to give.

48:52.156 --> 48:54.715
The new tenant is coming
to look over the place.

48:54.891 --> 48:56.290
He may not want me.

48:57.662 --> 49:01.621
Well, l got a place,
but it's nothing like this.

49:04.103 --> 49:06.832
This is like my home.

49:08.239 --> 49:11.004
l've been here a long time.

49:13.811 --> 49:16.906
You could take a shower
and let the water run as long as you like.

49:25.689 --> 49:27.679
You got....

49:29.025 --> 49:30.788
You got hot water here.

49:30.961 --> 49:32.986
Very hot.

49:33.630 --> 49:36.191
Jeez!

49:36.367 --> 49:40.700
l haven't had a hot bath....

49:42.004 --> 49:43.802
l'll rub you down afterwards.

49:49.546 --> 49:51.536
All right.

49:51.714 --> 49:54.115
You turn that air conditioner on
all the way.

49:54.284 --> 49:57.947
All the way up. We'll make it cold,
like winter used to be.

49:58.889 --> 50:01.789
-What about breakfast?
-Anything you like.

50:02.225 --> 50:03.716
-Strawberries.
-An egg.

50:03.894 --> 50:06.556
-No, strawberries.
-l've never seen strawberries.

50:06.730 --> 50:10.860
All right. An egg then.
Who the hell needs strawberries?

50:57.013 --> 51:00.743
Mommy! Mommy!

51:08.957 --> 51:12.585
-Hey, sister.
-Mommy!

51:13.460 --> 51:15.861
Mommy! Mommy!

51:16.030 --> 51:20.296
-Where's the priest?
-l think you'll find him over there.

51:54.570 --> 51:57.596
Thorn, Father, 1 4th Precinct.

51:58.773 --> 52:01.037
My name is Paul.

52:03.743 --> 52:04.904
Have l done something?

52:05.078 --> 52:09.276
No, l'm investigating the murder
of Mr. William Simonson.

52:10.082 --> 52:12.414
-Who do you say?
-Simonson.

52:12.585 --> 52:16.022
Quite an important man, a rich man.

52:16.523 --> 52:18.013
l have no recollection.

52:18.191 --> 52:19.953
-You talked to him.
-Did l?

52:20.126 --> 52:22.425
No doubt about it.

52:25.365 --> 52:27.423
A rich man.

52:27.868 --> 52:30.267
Yes, l remember.

52:31.537 --> 52:34.769
We don't see rich people here anymore.

52:34.940 --> 52:38.272
There isn't even enough room
for the poor.

52:39.279 --> 52:40.803
There's just too many.

52:41.382 --> 52:42.609
Far too many.

52:42.783 --> 52:45.013
-Fa--
-My memory's eroded.

52:45.619 --> 52:51.056
Chiefly, l assign space to people
who need space.

52:51.558 --> 52:54.492
Do you need some space?

52:55.295 --> 52:57.455
l need to know what he said to you.

52:57.630 --> 52:59.154
-Are you sure he's dead?
-Yes.

52:59.332 --> 53:00.629
-Really dead?
-He's dead.

53:00.800 --> 53:04.896
-What did he talk to you about?
-Come back tomorrow. l'm very tired now.

53:05.071 --> 53:07.005
Father.

53:07.239 --> 53:09.638
Father, did you hear his confession?

53:09.808 --> 53:13.802
There should be a requiem mass,
but there's no room.

53:13.978 --> 53:16.879
-Should l make room?
-This is very important.

53:17.248 --> 53:19.079
l can't help you.

53:19.250 --> 53:22.845
Forgive me. lt's destroying me.

53:23.487 --> 53:25.979
-What is?
-The truth.

53:26.157 --> 53:28.317
The truth Simonson told you?

53:28.493 --> 53:30.517
-All truth.
-What is it?

53:33.098 --> 53:34.726
What did he confess?

53:38.337 --> 53:41.171
Sweet Jesus.

53:59.624 --> 54:03.025
-We're closing the Simonson case.
-The hell you say.

54:03.194 --> 54:08.461
You heard me. The Simonson case is
officially closed. Felonious assault. Sign.

54:08.633 --> 54:11.692
Yesterday you agreed
it was assassination.

54:11.869 --> 54:16.066
There's been 1 37 reported murders since
then, and we won't solve them either.

54:16.305 --> 54:18.101
l'm not gonna falsify that report.

54:19.910 --> 54:21.240
Got a suspect?

54:21.411 --> 54:23.538
l've got leads.

54:23.813 --> 54:26.977
This isn't somebody you scratch
after 24 hours and forget.

54:27.150 --> 54:30.315
l told you there's been a tail on me.

54:30.722 --> 54:32.383
Something stinks here.

54:32.992 --> 54:37.428
-Look, you'll sign this, and l'll bury it.
-Like hell you will.

54:38.396 --> 54:42.730
A member of the board of the Soylent
Corporation was torn apart with a meat hook!

54:42.901 --> 54:46.667
You can't sweep that carcass
under the rug. Who bought you?

54:46.838 --> 54:49.897
-You're bought when they pay you a salary.
-Who's they?

54:50.072 --> 54:52.735
High and hot. They want this case
closed permanently!

54:52.910 --> 54:54.774
-Now sign this.
-You sign it!

54:54.944 --> 54:58.972
lf l close it and somebody higher and
hotter wants to know why, it's my job!

54:59.148 --> 55:00.639
Sign it. l'll cover for you.

55:00.818 --> 55:05.686
l won't put my job on the line
for you, Hatcher. Not my damn job!

55:11.594 --> 55:13.425
Hey, big shot.

55:13.596 --> 55:16.086
Hatcher says you're on riot control.

55:16.264 --> 55:19.701
Great. That really makes my day.

55:21.570 --> 55:26.976
This was once called Gramercy Park. Now
it's the only tree sanctuary in New York.

55:27.277 --> 55:30.110
Governor. Sorry to disturb you
this way, sir.

55:30.280 --> 55:32.213
Not at all, Donovan. Not at all.

55:32.381 --> 55:35.316
Your secretary told me where to find you.
lt's urgent...

55:35.485 --> 55:39.512
-...or l wouldn't have come out here.
-l understand.

55:41.190 --> 55:43.054
Now, what is it?

55:43.225 --> 55:46.127
l'm to inform you the board is determined
to resolve...

55:46.295 --> 55:48.820
...the Simonson investigation
immediately, sir.

55:49.165 --> 55:51.157
-l thought it was resolved.
-Yes, sir.

55:51.335 --> 55:55.394
But the police officer involved
refuses to close the case.

55:56.304 --> 55:58.329
Perhaps because he went
to church yesterday.

55:58.507 --> 56:01.600
-What does that mean?
-lt was Simonson's church.

56:02.142 --> 56:04.737
The cop spoke 20 minutes
with the priest.

56:04.913 --> 56:06.675
So?

56:06.847 --> 56:09.543
The same priest who heard
Simonson's confession.

56:09.717 --> 56:11.913
l don't wanna hear any more about it.

56:12.087 --> 56:14.919
l can't hear any more about it.

56:15.322 --> 56:17.348
Just do what you have to do.

56:44.686 --> 56:47.176
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

56:47.355 --> 56:51.189
lt has been six months
since my last confession.

57:08.207 --> 57:11.234
A real bargain, folks.
Synthetic footgear.

57:11.412 --> 57:13.436
Plastics. Plastic ware.

57:13.613 --> 57:16.379
We have a large assortment
of plastic ware.

57:16.550 --> 57:19.542
Some are a little chipped.
Others have hardly any cracks.

57:19.720 --> 57:24.522
Quick-energy yellow Soylent
made of genuine soybeans.

57:26.327 --> 57:31.391
Soylent crumbs! Two D's a kilo. Nothing
cheaper in the market. Come and get it.

57:31.566 --> 57:34.728
Soylent buns!
Get your genuine Soylent buns!

57:38.005 --> 57:42.600
Keep moving right along. Step right up.
Soylent Green. Soylent Green right here.

57:49.015 --> 57:51.175
They gave me a quarter of a kilo.

57:51.350 --> 57:56.186
l stood in line the whole lousy day,
and they gave me a quarter of a kilo!

57:56.356 --> 57:58.688
Do you believe that?

57:58.858 --> 58:03.591
Let me go! Are you gonna put up
with this?

58:25.018 --> 58:27.611
They're running out of the damn green.

58:27.786 --> 58:31.450
-ldiots.
-Some foul-up at transport.

58:31.624 --> 58:34.218
-This crowd will blow.
-l know.

58:34.393 --> 58:38.124
Got the scoops standing by,
but l don't know if they can handle this.

58:38.295 --> 58:40.559
When you gonna make
the announcement?

58:40.731 --> 58:42.927
As soon as l get up the nerve.

58:43.101 --> 58:45.535
About five minutes, l guess.
Better pass the word.

58:45.703 --> 58:47.568
Right.

58:53.144 --> 58:55.374
<i>This is the police.</i>

58:55.547 --> 58:58.014
<i>This is the police. This is the police.</i>

58:59.917 --> 59:03.250
<i>I am asking you to disperse.</i>

59:03.421 --> 59:06.619
<i>The supply of Soylent Green
has been exhausted.</i>

59:08.094 --> 59:10.619
<i>You must evacuate the area.</i>

59:10.929 --> 59:12.829
<i>The scoops are on their way.</i>

59:12.998 --> 59:15.432
<i>The scoops are on their way!</i>

59:15.599 --> 59:19.468
<i>I repeat: The scoops are on their way.</i>

59:19.838 --> 59:21.897
Today is Tuesday!

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.864
Why would you leave that door open?

01:02:17.577 --> 01:02:20.206
Mr. Fielding.

01:02:22.884 --> 01:02:25.819
-Why did you set up Simonson?
-l didn't.

01:02:25.987 --> 01:02:28.477
You're all there is.

01:02:30.689 --> 01:02:34.147
-Who pays your bills?
-l do.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:44.424
Oh, no. l won't hit a cop. Bastard.

01:02:44.602 --> 01:02:46.596
Yeah, l know.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:11.224
You get life for that, jerk!

01:03:11.397 --> 01:03:16.027
Life in a waste disposal plant
in a Soylent factory someplace.

01:03:24.209 --> 01:03:27.609
How about that big,
fat Soylent Corporation?

01:03:27.779 --> 01:03:30.806
Do you work for them like Simonson did?

01:03:30.983 --> 01:03:33.213
How much did they pay you
for that one?

01:03:33.385 --> 01:03:35.409
Does Soylent buy your strawberries?

01:03:36.353 --> 01:03:39.118
Anybody tails me,
bothers me one more time...

01:03:39.290 --> 01:03:43.751
...l'll come back here
and kill you both. Got it?

01:03:44.764 --> 01:03:47.232
Get off my back!

01:03:55.975 --> 01:03:57.909
Thorn.

01:03:58.077 --> 01:04:00.807
l was worried about you.

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.347
-What happened?
-Never mind.

01:04:04.516 --> 01:04:06.245
lt doesn't matter.

01:04:06.418 --> 01:04:08.816
lt doesn't matter.

01:04:41.085 --> 01:04:43.781
-Good evening, Mr. Roth.
-Good evening.

01:04:43.955 --> 01:04:44.979
Thank you.

01:04:58.802 --> 01:05:02.033
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Mr. Roth.

01:05:02.205 --> 01:05:04.106
-Mr. Roth.
-Good evening, Mr. Roth.

01:05:04.275 --> 01:05:05.639
Good evening, Your Honor.

01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:08.869
l assume you have a priority
police problem.

01:05:09.046 --> 01:05:13.482
Yes, Your Honor.
lt's about William Simonson.

01:05:14.216 --> 01:05:15.876
And...

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.246
...these.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:33.869
Thorn.

01:05:34.372 --> 01:05:37.738
Thorn. lt's curfew.

01:05:39.843 --> 01:05:42.004
How do you feel?

01:05:43.013 --> 01:05:45.072
A lot better.

01:05:45.248 --> 01:05:46.737
l did the best l could...

01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:49.783
...but l still think you should go see
the police doctor.

01:05:49.952 --> 01:05:52.182
He might relieve me from duty.

01:05:52.354 --> 01:05:54.117
You need a rest.

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:57.124
More than two days,
and l lose my job.

01:05:57.294 --> 01:06:00.194
-We could go to another city.
-What for?

01:06:00.363 --> 01:06:02.330
They're all like this.

01:06:02.498 --> 01:06:04.762
-The country?
-That's not allowed.

01:06:04.934 --> 01:06:07.561
Those farms are like fortresses.

01:06:07.735 --> 01:06:10.169
-Why?
-Good land's gotta be guarded...

01:06:10.338 --> 01:06:12.806
...the way they guard
the waste disposal plants...

01:06:12.974 --> 01:06:16.138
...and Soylent factories
and the plankton ships.

01:06:16.312 --> 01:06:20.680
You know, there are idiots in this world
who wanna take everything we've got.

01:06:20.849 --> 01:06:25.876
-Maybe Simonson was one of them.
-l don't believe it.

01:06:26.587 --> 01:06:30.388
lt means there's no place
for us to go.

01:06:30.558 --> 01:06:32.550
That's right.

01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:34.821
Why should we?

01:06:39.767 --> 01:06:41.600
You be careful now.

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.601
Keep the scanners on.

01:06:43.772 --> 01:06:46.172
Don't go anyplace without a bodyguard.

01:06:46.341 --> 01:06:49.175
The new tenant comes tonight.

01:06:50.212 --> 01:06:51.838
He'll like you.

01:06:53.413 --> 01:06:56.348
You're a hell of a piece of furniture.

01:06:57.384 --> 01:06:59.352
Don't talk to me like that.

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:03.620
Please.

01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:06.892
Okay.

01:07:12.132 --> 01:07:14.099
lt's horrible.

01:07:14.267 --> 01:07:16.964
You must accept it.

01:07:17.237 --> 01:07:20.468
l see the words,
but l can't believe them.

01:07:21.073 --> 01:07:23.134
Believe.

01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:26.276
The evidence is overwhelming.

01:07:27.014 --> 01:07:31.611
Simonson was a member of the board.

01:07:32.119 --> 01:07:36.954
He learned these facts,
and they shook his sanity.

01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:39.859
The corporation knew...

01:07:40.962 --> 01:07:44.192
...he was not reliable anymore.

01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:47.424
They feared he might talk...

01:07:47.601 --> 01:07:50.001
...and so he was eliminated.

01:07:51.972 --> 01:07:55.635
-Then why are they doing this?
-Because it's easier.

01:07:56.410 --> 01:08:00.037
l think ''expedient'' is the word.

01:08:00.479 --> 01:08:05.678
What we need is the proof
of what they are doing...

01:08:06.085 --> 01:08:09.486
...before we bring it
to the Council of Nations.

01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:13.658
Good God.

01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:16.854
What God, Mr. Roth?

01:08:17.328 --> 01:08:20.993
Where will we find him?

01:08:22.069 --> 01:08:24.332
Perhaps at home.

01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:30.807
Yes, at home.

01:08:48.026 --> 01:08:51.984
l waited two whole damn years
for an apartment to open up in this building.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:54.325
lt's a nice place.

01:08:59.705 --> 01:09:03.537
-How long have you been here?
-A long time.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:07.040
How old are you?

01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:08.801
Twenty-one.

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:12.040
Charles said you were 24.

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:13.776
That makes us both liars.

01:09:16.988 --> 01:09:18.511
All right.

01:09:18.923 --> 01:09:20.720
All right.

01:09:21.827 --> 01:09:24.624
l sleep late.
l like a big breakfast and no lunch.

01:09:24.796 --> 01:09:28.665
l'll organize the menu for dinner.
Three or four times a week, l have guests.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:31.961
Sometimes it's business,
and then we have to be alone.

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:36.502
Sometimes it's fun, and then we like
a girl who's fun.

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.765
Are you fun?

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.561
May l help you, sir?

01:10:05.369 --> 01:10:09.362
-lt feels good.
-Yes, sir. Won't you come in?

01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.913
And your favorite color?

01:10:58.186 --> 01:11:00.120
Orange, l guess.

01:11:00.288 --> 01:11:02.653
-Music?
-Classical.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:07.295
-Light classical.
-l'm sure you'll enjoy it.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:13.234
Sign here, please, Mr. Roth.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:18.431
-A full 20 minutes?
-Oh, certainly. Guaranteed.

01:11:22.043 --> 01:11:23.737
Thank you.

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:29.008
This way, please, Mr. Roth.

01:11:29.951 --> 01:11:33.614
Good evening, ma'am.
May l have your name, please?

01:11:35.257 --> 01:11:38.250
Well, l see that orange
is your favorite color.

01:12:22.836 --> 01:12:24.738
-You want Mr. Solomon Roth?
-That's right.

01:12:24.906 --> 01:12:27.066
This way, please.

01:13:32.971 --> 01:13:34.403
My God.

01:13:34.572 --> 01:13:38.372
lt's truly unfortunate that you
missed the overture.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:55.222
-l want to see him.
-That is prohibited during the ceremony.

01:13:55.395 --> 01:13:56.657
Well, l can assure you--

01:13:56.829 --> 01:13:59.160
Open that damn thing right now...

01:13:59.331 --> 01:14:01.696
...or l swear to God
you'll die before he does.

01:14:01.866 --> 01:14:05.166
All right! All right.

01:15:35.258 --> 01:15:38.749
Sol, can you hear me?

01:15:40.564 --> 01:15:43.157
<i>-Thorn?
-Yes.</i>

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:44.857
Thank you for coming.

01:15:46.769 --> 01:15:49.933
<i>-Oh, dear God.
-l've lived too long.</i>

01:15:51.307 --> 01:15:52.774
<i>No.</i>

01:15:54.078 --> 01:15:55.635
l love you, Thorn.

01:15:59.749 --> 01:16:01.377
l love you, Sol.

01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:14.194
Can you see it?

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:17.722
Yes.

01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:21.302
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

01:16:22.671 --> 01:16:24.366
Oh, yes.

01:16:30.779 --> 01:16:32.905
l told you.

01:16:34.283 --> 01:16:36.684
How could l know?

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.781
How could l...?

01:16:41.658 --> 01:16:43.352
How could l ever imagine?

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:16.451
Horrible.

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:20.416
Simonson.

01:17:22.363 --> 01:17:24.455
Soylent.

01:17:27.233 --> 01:17:30.068
Listen to me, Thorn.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:31.803
Thorn, listen.

01:17:37.845 --> 01:17:39.905
l can't hear him.

01:17:40.082 --> 01:17:42.482
Do something, damn it!

01:17:48.323 --> 01:17:49.653
Yes, Sol.

01:18:00.767 --> 01:18:04.395
<i>You've got to prove it, Thorn.</i>

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.073
<i>Go to the Exchange.</i>

01:18:09.042 --> 01:18:10.668
<i>Please, Thorn.</i>

01:18:13.547 --> 01:18:16.983
You've got to prove it, Thorn.

01:18:17.284 --> 01:18:19.582
The Exchange.

01:18:20.319 --> 01:18:21.308
Go to....

01:27:18.012 --> 01:27:22.949
<i>-Dispatch.
-Thorn, lD RC1 05.</i>

01:27:23.117 --> 01:27:25.552
Get me the 1 4th Precinct. Urgent.

01:27:25.721 --> 01:27:27.654
<i>Just a moment.</i>

01:27:27.822 --> 01:27:30.848
<i>-The circuit is in use.
-Well, break in!</i>

01:27:31.025 --> 01:27:33.822
<i>It's a 6- 1 priority.</i>

01:27:34.227 --> 01:27:38.758
Look, get me Chelsea Towers West.
Apartment 22A.

01:27:38.935 --> 01:27:41.732
<i>-Cut in if you get the 1 4th.
-Understood.</i>

01:27:49.211 --> 01:27:51.236
-Hello?
-Shirl, it's me.

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:54.839
Oh, Thorn, l'm so glad.
l have to talk to you.

01:27:55.015 --> 01:27:57.313
No, there's no time.

01:27:58.018 --> 01:28:01.180
-The new tenant wanted me.
-Good. Stay with him.

01:28:01.354 --> 01:28:03.482
l want you to stay with him always.

01:28:03.657 --> 01:28:05.852
Oh, Thorn, l want to live with you.

01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:08.124
Just live.

01:28:08.294 --> 01:28:10.593
<i>-I have Lt. Hatcher.
-Plug him in.</i>

01:28:10.898 --> 01:28:12.264
Thorn?

01:28:12.434 --> 01:28:13.729
Thorn.

01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.996
<i>-Thorn, where the hell have you been?
-I'm at the Exchange.</i>

01:28:21.074 --> 01:28:22.598
Hatcher, help me.

01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:53.438
There's another one over there.

01:32:57.778 --> 01:33:01.737
-Hey, punk, are you with us?
-Hatcher.

01:33:02.250 --> 01:33:06.346
-Did l get him?
-Yeah, you got him, all right.

01:33:06.521 --> 01:33:09.457
You don't listen too good,
but you're a damn good cop.

01:33:09.625 --> 01:33:11.251
Hatcher...

01:33:11.759 --> 01:33:15.490
...get to the Exchange.

01:33:16.064 --> 01:33:18.429
You gotta tell them they're right.

01:33:18.598 --> 01:33:21.533
But let's take care of you first.

01:33:23.471 --> 01:33:26.066
You don't understand.

01:33:26.374 --> 01:33:28.137
l've got proof.

01:33:28.309 --> 01:33:30.776
They need proof.

01:33:31.812 --> 01:33:34.304
l've seen it. l've seen it happening.

01:33:35.883 --> 01:33:37.316
They've gotta tell people.

01:33:37.751 --> 01:33:43.882
-Tell them what?
-The ocean's dying. Plankton's dying.

01:33:44.622 --> 01:33:47.183
lt's people.

01:33:48.828 --> 01:33:53.629
Soylent Green is made out of people.

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:12.616
They're making our food out of people.

01:34:12.786 --> 01:34:16.915
Next thing, they'll be breeding us
like cattle for food.

01:34:17.089 --> 01:34:19.615
You've gotta tell them.
You've gotta tell them.

01:34:19.793 --> 01:34:22.488
l promise, tiger. l promise.
l'll tell the Exchange.

01:34:22.661 --> 01:34:24.492
You tell everybody.

01:34:24.663 --> 01:34:27.531
Listen to me, Hatcher.
You've gotta tell them!

01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:31.158
Soylent Green is people!

01:34:31.337 --> 01:34:35.295
We've gotta stop them somehow!
