WEBVTT

00:38.959 --> 00:41.375
Bravo! Bravo!

00:59.208 --> 01:00.625
Papa.

01:19.375 --> 01:20.625
Where is she?

01:20.709 --> 01:22.250
Isn't she coming
back for an
encore?

01:40.333 --> 01:42.166
Speakenzee Englishsky?

01:42.250 --> 01:43.959
Oh. Eh.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.125
I'm sorry. Um..

01:47.208 --> 01:49.000
For my family, please.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.208
We ask for your kind help.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.875
Well, only a little.

01:56.959 --> 01:57.875
Uh.

02:00.458 --> 02:03.083
You a Russky too, Vera?

02:03.166 --> 02:04.458
Go get 'em, rook.

02:10.291 --> 02:12.083
Whoa, sir.
I ain't
fluent.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.375
I got curses
and toasts, that's
all.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.250
Papa, please.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.709
We surrender our passports.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.750
We want to defect
to United States.

02:23.834 --> 02:25.750
The United States.

02:25.834 --> 02:28.583
You speak English...big time.

02:28.667 --> 02:31.959
I learned by watching American
television on the black market.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.166
Don't tell my father.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.917
You, uh, coming
from the prom?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Uh.

02:39.083 --> 02:41.041
Uh, a concert.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.875
This dress
belonged to my
mother.

02:44.500 --> 02:45.875
We'll, uh, call
the State Department

02:45.959 --> 02:47.583
and get someone
down here to meet you.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.417
Discuss political asylum.

02:55.083 --> 02:58.875
You know, if you do this
there's no going back.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.250
Yeah.

03:07.333 --> 03:09.792
Welcome to the
United States, little man.

03:11.166 --> 03:13.583
(Nadia)
'I am sorry.
He only knows police'

03:13.667 --> 03:16.542
in Russia, where
they can't be trusted.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.959
Things are different here.

03:23.250 --> 03:25.750
You call me, any time.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.500
I'll help you out.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.834
And, uh, for your,
uh, collection.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.750
Philadelphia.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.959
Our new home.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.875
I haven't responded
to a fight on the highway

04:34.959 --> 04:36.375
since I was in uniform.

04:36.458 --> 04:37.667
Call came in from the district

04:37.750 --> 04:39.166
someone asking
for me by name.

04:39.250 --> 04:41.959
Don't touch me I'll turn
that face into scrap metal!

04:42.041 --> 04:43.583
Yeah, I'll kill you first.

04:43.667 --> 04:44.834
Your kind of crowd, Nick.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.750
Who's the guy?

04:48.625 --> 04:49.625
I know you?

04:49.709 --> 04:52.875
Yeah, you said
I could call anytime.

05:01.417 --> 05:02.333
I'm Dimitri.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.709
Yeah,
Koslov.
I remember.

05:05.792 --> 05:06.875
What's going on?

05:06.959 --> 05:08.250
This scum has my sister's bag.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.583
This bag ain't even mine, man!

05:09.667 --> 05:11.125
So where'd
you get it, tough guy?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.250
Cousin Beamer.
Just denied
parole.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.041
His mama's giving
away his stuff.

05:16.125 --> 05:18.208
- Son of a bitch.
- Know whose it is?

05:18.291 --> 05:21.000
- Nadia Koslov.
- Who's she?

05:21.083 --> 05:24.333
I was in the Ninth District
the night the family
defected.

05:24.417 --> 05:26.667
Four months later,
I was at her funeral.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.667
"Nadia Koslov,
17-years-old.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.291
"Skull fracture, severe
bruising, manner of
death.."

06:05.375 --> 06:07.417
Undetermined.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.750
Multiple blunt-force
trauma with cardiac arrest

06:09.834 --> 06:12.542
consistent with other
wilding victims that night.

06:12.625 --> 06:15.250
Serious crime wave
in the subways, fall of
'89.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.458
Packs of kids surrounding
their victims, commuters
mostly.

06:18.542 --> 06:22.125
I'm 22 years old, I just
aced my firearms training

06:22.208 --> 06:24.875
and my ma's begging me not
to take the Broad Street line.

06:24.959 --> 06:26.291
Well, your mom wasn't wrong.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.834
The assailants got her bag but

06:27.917 --> 06:29.542
they left her
jean jacket,
sneakers

06:29.625 --> 06:31.458
and an empty caste tape.

06:32.875 --> 06:36.458
She made some kind
of mix tape, the day she died

06:36.542 --> 06:39.291
She was gonna be
a big opera star

06:39.375 --> 06:41.875
but she loved pop culture.

06:41.959 --> 06:45.083
Toughest funeral
I ever went to.

06:45.166 --> 06:47.375
I promised the Koslovs that
things would be different
here

06:47.458 --> 06:50.041
but they were worse.

06:50.125 --> 06:52.625
Cousin of the punk
we picked up in Center City.

06:52.709 --> 06:54.000
Arrested on agg assault charges

06:54.083 --> 06:56.125
three months
after Nadia's murder.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.458
Known ties with the crew

06:57.542 --> 07:00.000
who was out wilding
the night Nadia
died.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.709
Lab found residue on her bag.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.250
This clown's DNA shows up

07:04.333 --> 07:06.542
'we got a slam-dunk.'

07:10.208 --> 07:14.000
What was it about Nadia
Koslov's
bag caught your eye?

07:14.083 --> 07:15.542
You like the patches?

07:15.625 --> 07:18.709
The places your sorry ass
will never see, huh, Beamer?

07:18.792 --> 07:20.333
I ain't Beamer no more.

07:20.417 --> 07:22.333
I found my Lord and Savior.

07:22.417 --> 07:23.625
I go by Michael now.

07:23.709 --> 07:24.834
Tell me what
happened that night

07:24.917 --> 07:26.333
or I'll start using
your grownup name.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.875
It wasn't me
who killed her, man.

07:27.959 --> 07:30.417
No? Then how'd you get her bag?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.875
When I found her,
she was already half-dead.

07:57.750 --> 07:58.750
Oh, man.

08:02.291 --> 08:03.542
Zo.

08:05.917 --> 08:06.875
Zo.

08:06.959 --> 08:08.291
- Say what?
- Zo.

08:09.583 --> 08:10.875
<i>Zol toi.</i>

08:38.000 --> 08:40.917
Seeing that girl die like that

08:41.000 --> 08:43.375
all alone.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.583
Messed me up real good, man.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.417
'Nothing else
to do but pray.'

08:48.500 --> 08:51.667
What's that you heard her say?

08:51.750 --> 08:54.000
Zula Toy.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.333
(Scotty)
'Is that Russian or
something?'

08:55.417 --> 08:56.500
(Michael)
'I don't know.'

08:56.583 --> 08:58.417
'But it's stuck
in my head to this day.'

08:58.500 --> 09:00.458
Well, you see
anyone else in the subway?

09:00.542 --> 09:04.208
I only heard the girl
falling
and footsteps.

09:04.291 --> 09:05.500
What kind of footsteps?

09:05.583 --> 09:07.166
The running kind.

09:07.250 --> 09:09.500
A bunch of Air Jordan's up
the stairs two at a time?

09:09.583 --> 09:14.834
Up the stairs but they
was like clickety-clack

09:14.917 --> 09:15.959
'you know what
I'm sayin'?'

09:16.041 --> 09:18.125
- Hard-soled shoes?
- Yeah.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.166
How many?

09:19.250 --> 09:20.583
One person, that's all.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.125
(Scotty)
'You're saying it wasn't
a wilding thing?'

09:23.208 --> 09:24.417
(Michael)
'God is my witness.'

09:24.500 --> 09:27.083
And I ain't got
no reason to lie.

09:31.041 --> 09:32.458
Clickety-clack.

09:37.083 --> 09:38.792
Zula Toy?

09:38.875 --> 09:40.625
Come on, Yakov Smirnoff.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.208
Tell me you know
what it means.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.959
No clue. Like I told
you, curses and toasts.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.500
But I know someone who might.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.834
You say you cannot convict
man who killed my daughter.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.500
Now you say you can?

09:58.583 --> 10:01.500
What I'm saying, Leo,
is that we've got a new lead

10:01.583 --> 10:02.875
Nadia's dying words.

10:02.959 --> 10:04.792
Zula Toy.

10:04.875 --> 10:06.375
That mean anything to you?

10:06.458 --> 10:08.750
I have no idea
why Nadia say this.

10:08.834 --> 10:09.834
<i>Zolotoi.</i>

10:09.917 --> 10:13.000
It means
gold,
golden one.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.291
Come on, pop.
They're trying to
help.

10:14.375 --> 10:15.500
They cannot bring back Nadia.

10:15.583 --> 10:17.667
(Nick)
'We have witness testimony.'

10:17.750 --> 10:20.250
Whoever killed Nadia
didn't steal anything.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.583
Drian

10:23.667 --> 10:25.333
She knows this person?

10:26.917 --> 10:29.709
What do you remember
about the night Nadia died?

10:29.792 --> 10:32.458
Pop was driving his
usual night shift.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.000
I was upstairs
with the
babysitter.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.041
Anyone come to mind,
had a problem with Nadia?

10:37.125 --> 10:39.375
Of course.
<i>durdom?</i>

10:39.458 --> 10:40.709
(Dimitri)
'The insane asylum.'

10:40.792 --> 10:42.041
That's what he
called her high
school.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.875
Regis High School
of the Performing Arts.

10:44.959 --> 10:46.625
Nadia was a voice major.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.166
I thought it was a good school.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.625
Pop hated the place. A lot
different than the
conservatory

10:51.709 --> 10:53.000
'back in St. Petersburg.'

10:53.083 --> 10:54.458
(Leo)
'At Regis there is no
study.'

10:54.542 --> 10:56.250
Only craziness.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.792
You say it is someone she knows.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.250
It is someone there.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.667
My tax dollars
paying
for this circus?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.417
Can hardly hear
myself think.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.500
My high school,
we were lucky

11:10.583 --> 11:11.834
to get a field
trip to the dump.

11:12.959 --> 11:14.709
Hey, hey, hey.

11:19.834 --> 11:22.583
- Clickety-clack.
- 'Detectives?'

11:22.667 --> 11:23.750
I'm Elliot Glick.

11:23.834 --> 11:25.709
Right this way.

11:25.792 --> 11:26.917
Bear with me.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.417
Office hours
will start in a few.

11:31.834 --> 11:34.083
- Cute haircut, Jules.
- Thank, Elliot.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.542
Nadia's death was a tragedy.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.917
She'd only been
in the country four months.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.458
- You knew her?
- Not really.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.417
I was the head
of the drama department

11:43.500 --> 11:44.583
and she was a voice major

11:44.667 --> 11:47.166
so, you know,
we didn't interact much.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.375
You remember
any students or faculty

11:49.458 --> 11:50.875
<i>Zolotoi?</i>

11:50.959 --> 11:52.333
No, that doesn't
ring a bell.

11:52.417 --> 11:53.917
We'll need the attendance
and disciplinary records

11:54.000 --> 11:56.041
from that year,
Nadia's files, yearbook,
too.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.208
Anything you want.

11:57.291 --> 11:59.792
See you have an
all-girl
fan club outside.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.834
Nadia a member when
she was a student?

12:01.917 --> 12:03.959
I told you
we didn't interact much.

12:04.041 --> 12:05.583
What about the night she died?

12:05.667 --> 12:07.750
I was at home with my wife.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.583
We were divorced 15 years ago,
but she'll remember, we were..

12:10.667 --> 12:12.959
...we were devastated
when we got the call.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.917
Better luck second time around?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.208
Third time's a charm.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.917
We'll need a list
of her teachers.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.834
Well, she only
had one Phoebe Curtis.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.000
Former student of mine.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.417
One teacher?
How's that happen?

12:25.500 --> 12:27.125
Phoebe taught
an advanced workshop.

12:27.208 --> 12:28.709
Only eight
students were accepted

12:28.792 --> 12:30.917
and Nadia was one of them.

12:31.041 --> 12:34.500
I understand you were
Nadia Koslov's teacher at
Regis.

12:34.583 --> 12:36.083
She was in my
improv workshop.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.000
I was an alumna, too.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.500
Artist-in-residence.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.375
Class of '77.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.500
"Voice major", right?

12:42.583 --> 12:43.667
I'm a much better trophy wife

12:43.750 --> 12:45.542
than I ever was a singer.

12:45.625 --> 12:47.000
Who else was in your workshop?

12:47.083 --> 12:49.083
A couple of kids
from each of the departments.

12:49.166 --> 12:52.667
They collaborated in class, and
then completed a final project.

12:52.750 --> 12:53.959
This final project

12:54.041 --> 12:55.417
Nadia work with
anyone in particular?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.041
Oh, no, it was
a solo performance.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.500
They had to improvise
on the city streets

13:00.583 --> 13:02.667
and then submit
a recording of it

13:02.750 --> 13:03.667
'for their final grade.'

13:03.750 --> 13:05.083
Like, on a cassette tape?

13:05.166 --> 13:06.583
Or a videotape,
something like that.

13:06.667 --> 13:07.792
You still have Nadia's?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.834
She died before completing
the course work.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.125
I never got to hear it.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.083
How long was the
last time you saw
her?

13:14.250 --> 13:16.375
In my class,
the day before she died.

13:16.458 --> 13:19.792
Did Nadia ever have
any nicknames for
you?

13:19.875 --> 13:21.250
Not that I know of.

13:21.333 --> 13:23.542
But I'm sure there was
some of that behind my back.

13:23.625 --> 13:25.709
I had a reputation
for being demanding.

13:25.792 --> 13:28.041
Any of her classmates
have any problems with
her?

13:28.125 --> 13:31.417
Nadia was a world-class soprano.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.166
They were all jealous.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.792
What they didn't realize is that

13:35.875 --> 13:39.083
she was struggling
just as hard as they were.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.667
Nadia.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.000
Nadia, I'm sorry.

13:47.083 --> 13:51.041
Nadia! I'm gonna
have
to ask you to stop.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.417
I did something wrong?

13:52.500 --> 13:55.583
I asked you to prepare
a piece that expresses

13:55.667 --> 13:57.750
you

13:57.834 --> 13:58.917
It is my signature aria.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.291
I perform it in concert.

14:00.375 --> 14:04.917
Nadia, I want to hear
your voice, your soul

14:05.000 --> 14:07.083
not your technique.

14:07.166 --> 14:08.333
But my father says..

14:08.417 --> 14:09.667
I'm not talking
about your father.

14:09.750 --> 14:11.375
I'm talking about you, Nadia.

14:11.458 --> 14:13.166
<i>you?</i>

14:14.500 --> 14:16.500
Not what you think.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.041
What you feel.

14:25.709 --> 14:27.166
I don't know.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.875
Okay.

14:29.959 --> 14:31.875
Well, have a seat
until you figure it
out.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.125
Cyrus, get up there
and open up a vein.

14:39.208 --> 14:42.208
- Ow!
- 'Nadia, what's the
problem?'

14:46.917 --> 14:48.458
Black roses.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.709
I must have an admirer.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.500
Maybe I was too hard on her.

15:10.583 --> 15:14.291
You know, those kids
were tough enough on themselves.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.083
And each other.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.792
That girl at the door.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.959
Chelsea.
Chelsea Cutler.

15:21.417 --> 15:24.291
She had just lost
her spot in my workshop.

15:24.375 --> 15:26.917
- To Nadia.
- Yes.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.166
- What's with the black roses?
- They were Chelsea's thing.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.542
She doodled them everywhere.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.166
Had a black rose
tattoo, the whole nine.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.542
After Nadia died,
you give her spot to anyone?

15:36.625 --> 15:38.792
'Well, since it
was available'

15:38.875 --> 15:40.750
I gave it to Chelsea.

15:45.542 --> 15:46.709
(Kat)
'Boss.'

15:46.792 --> 15:47.834
What do you got?

15:47.917 --> 15:50.667
Lab ID'd the substance
on Nadia's bag.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.291
- Methyl salicylate.
- What is it?

15:53.375 --> 15:55.333
It's a compound found
in aspirin and muscle rubs.

15:55.417 --> 15:58.041
This case, in something
called oil of wintergreen.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.208
Oil of wintergreen?
Saying she ingested it?

16:00.291 --> 16:02.458
Yep. Found trace amounts
in her blood samples.

16:02.542 --> 16:03.917
Lab never tested it
back in the day.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.250
'Cause they thought
it was a wilding
incident.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.458
Trace amounts enough
to cause a fatal
overdose?

16:08.542 --> 16:11.041
Not usually,
but Nadia had asthma.

16:11.125 --> 16:12.834
People like her
aspirin compounds

16:12.917 --> 16:14.375
can be highly toxic.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.709
Would have happened
almost immediately.

16:15.792 --> 16:16.959
Caused the cardiac arrest.

16:17.041 --> 16:18.542
That's what the ME said.

16:18.625 --> 16:21.542
And get this. Oil of
wintergreen's a coagulant.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.792
Bruises would have
gotten worse after she died.

16:23.875 --> 16:26.041
Making it look like
she had been beaten.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.041
Nothing random
about this crime, boss.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.750
Nadia was poisoned.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.208
Oil of wintergreen's toxic?

16:38.291 --> 16:40.458
What, like,
death
by breath mint?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.000
In its concentrated form.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.792
You know, little brown
glass dropper bottle.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.041
Where did she
get the stuff?

16:45.125 --> 16:46.959
No poisoning
websites in
'89.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.291
Well, any health food store.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.417
Lucky for me,
not many around back then.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.625
What the
hell
is it used
for?

16:51.709 --> 16:52.917
Flavoring in candy

16:53.000 --> 16:55.166
fragrance in muscle
rubs and lip balms

16:55.250 --> 16:57.458
and, uh, beekeeping.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.250
Beekeeping?

17:00.333 --> 17:04.041
"An essential oil for
promoting healthy
swarms."

17:04.125 --> 17:05.291
So, after tap class

17:05.375 --> 17:08.250
Chelsea Cutler's
tending her bees.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.125
I'm working on it,
okay?
Don't hate.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.542
And why do you
keep saying she?

17:11.625 --> 17:13.166
Could have been
a guy, you know?

17:13.250 --> 17:16.083
Come on, you know how
the ladies love to poison.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.208
Better watch what you drink.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.041
(female #1)
'I need the transcribes.'

17:29.125 --> 17:32.417
Oh, sorry.
I needed some
joe.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.875
Uh, no problem.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.583
Got her waiting.

17:43.041 --> 17:44.917
So.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.041
Got any tattoos, Chelsea?

17:47.125 --> 17:48.792
Tattoos?

17:48.875 --> 17:51.291
I thought you wanted
to ask me about Nadia
Koslov.

17:51.375 --> 17:54.083
Like answers better
than questions around here.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.792
Uh, yes, one.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.250
- A black rose.
- Black roses.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.500
That your thing back in '89?

18:02.583 --> 18:04.166
Oh, God.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.458
What I did to
Nadia
with the roses.

18:06.542 --> 18:07.500
You think it was me?

18:07.583 --> 18:08.834
Took careful planning getting

18:08.917 --> 18:10.458
those things in her bag
no one seeing.

18:10.542 --> 18:11.792
(Lilly)
'Cunning and preparation'

18:11.875 --> 18:14.875
two key ingredients
in homicidal poisoning.

18:14.959 --> 18:16.250
Poisoning?

18:16.333 --> 18:18.083
I thought it was a
bunch
of guys in the subway.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.333
It's a real personal
way of killing someone.

18:20.417 --> 18:21.583
(Lilly)
'You remember who got Nadia's'

18:21.667 --> 18:24.041
spot in Phoebe's
workshop after she died?

18:24.125 --> 18:27.125
Oh, please,
I did not kill
her.

18:27.208 --> 18:29.625
Nadia was stealing your
spotlight you stole it back.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.125
I was angry, and
what
I did was totally
stupid

18:32.208 --> 18:34.667
'but once she got
into that workshop'

18:34.750 --> 18:36.667
she had much
bigger problems than
me.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.792
Oh, yeah?
How is that?

18:38.875 --> 18:41.959
Kids in that class
were the best of the best.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.166
They got whatever they wanted.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.417
And somebody wanted Nadia.

19:13.166 --> 19:15.375
Career concept
ditch the ethnic last name.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.500
Move over, Madonna
hello, Nadia.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.625
Whoo!

19:39.834 --> 19:41.917
You are so busted.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.917
Who knew?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.583
She totally gets it.

19:44.667 --> 19:45.959
A dance?

19:59.834 --> 20:01.458
They were attached
at the hip after
that.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.000
Never saw one without the other.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.041
They still dating
when Nadia died?

20:05.125 --> 20:06.291
Hot and heavy.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.083
Probably wouldn't
have thought
twice.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.959
Till I saw him on a gay
bar
crawl a couple years
ago.

20:12.083 --> 20:15.625
Gay? You just said
he was dating a girl.

20:15.709 --> 20:18.458
Exactly. The guy was a mess.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.291
Couldn't sleep, either?

20:36.375 --> 20:38.542
Hey, what do you got?

20:38.625 --> 20:40.041
Pepperoni.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.875
The books.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.500
"Opera for Dummies."

20:45.583 --> 20:48.000
my
was complicated.

20:48.083 --> 20:51.208
Plots in these things
talk about twists and
turns.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.542
<i>Zolotoi?</i>

20:53.625 --> 20:56.166
I looked for
Zolotoi,
one

20:56.250 --> 20:57.500
Gold...got nothing.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.208
Except how many of
them have
poisonings.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.875
Popular way to go in opera.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.166
What about you?

21:04.250 --> 21:07.041
Looking in Regis directories,
Russian fables.

21:07.125 --> 21:11.250
Even e-mailed a professor
of St. Petersburg
Conservatory.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.208
Shot in the dark.

21:15.291 --> 21:18.166
Shot in the dark's
better than
nothing.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.500
<i>Zolotoi.</i>

21:29.583 --> 21:31.834
<i>Zolotoi.</i>

21:40.500 --> 21:43.208
You and Nadia
close back at Regis?

21:43.291 --> 21:44.625
Absolutely.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.917
I wanted to write
musicals for her.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.542
I was the songwriter
she was the voice.

21:50.625 --> 21:51.875
Thinking more
on the romantic
tip.

21:51.959 --> 21:55.709
Oh. Yeah, we fooled
around a few times.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.583
I guess you could say I was
an equal opportunity crush.

21:59.792 --> 22:01.542
- Bisexual.
- Right.

22:01.625 --> 22:02.834
Yeah, it wasn't until college

22:02.917 --> 22:05.041
that I chose my
major so to speak.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.667
You sound like
a confused guy,
Cyrus.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.500
Getting close to
Nadia even though

22:09.583 --> 22:11.208
you were on a different bus.

22:11.291 --> 22:13.000
(Cyrus)
'Maybe it was because
she was an outsider.'

22:13.083 --> 22:15.291
We just sort
of found each other.

22:15.375 --> 22:17.959
- You two have any pet names?
- No.

22:18.041 --> 22:21.709
But we certainly
did adore each other.

22:21.792 --> 22:23.709
I haven't set foot
back in the subway since

22:23.792 --> 22:27.417
she was...you know.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.125
Ever hear her use the word
Zolotoi?

22:31.208 --> 22:33.750
No, she only spoke
Russian with her family.

22:33.834 --> 22:36.583
With me, she shared the things
that she couldn't bring home.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.208
- Like what?
- Her dreams.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.917
Where you headed,
Ms. Thing?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.542
I'm going to talk to Nikki
about my final project.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.083
Share. Now.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.834
Well, the other day, singing
with you in the subway.

22:47.917 --> 22:50.250
[chuckles]
You're going to
laugh.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.291
Never.

22:51.375 --> 22:52.458
I know it sounds stupid

22:52.542 --> 22:54.667
but that was my voice.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.250
You know, like Phoebe said

22:56.333 --> 23:01.291
I was feeling, not thinking.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.917
I want to be
the singer in a
band.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.959
[chuckles]
A star is born!

23:05.041 --> 23:06.166
Yeah, just don't tell my father.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.542
He thinks
I'm preparing an
opera.

23:07.625 --> 23:09.125
Your father's,
like, in the KGB.

23:09.208 --> 23:10.291
Only way
I'm talking to him

23:10.375 --> 23:12.125
is if there's a gun to my head.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.667
And Nikki's going
to be your backup dancer?

23:13.750 --> 23:15.333
Well, I want her help
me with choreography.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.041
I mean, if I stand
there in my ball
gown

23:17.125 --> 23:18.375
for another minute like this..

23:18.458 --> 23:20.458
She's probably not
the greatest choice, Nadia.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.917
Why not?
She's the
best.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.291
But she's so not a team player.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.291
'Stop gawking at me.'

23:33.375 --> 23:35.250
And get your pet
Commie out of here.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.750
Nikki, what are you doing?

23:36.834 --> 23:39.792
Just warming up for
three hours on toe shoes.

23:39.875 --> 23:40.834
What does it look like?

23:40.917 --> 23:42.208
An overdose.

23:43.792 --> 23:47.000
But you're good. You're great.
You don't need this stuff.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.834
What I need is for you
to get the hell out here.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.667
I'm gonna go get some help.
You're gonna be--

23:52.750 --> 23:54.333
Bitch, if you get
anyone, I swear to God

23:54.417 --> 23:56.375
you'll wish you hadn't.

24:05.875 --> 24:07.625
Nadia consider
herself warned?

24:07.709 --> 24:08.625
I don't think so.

24:08.709 --> 24:10.208
That same week, Regis instituted

24:10.291 --> 24:14.166
a zero-tolerance drug policy
and Nikki was expelled.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.709
Well, how'd the
prima
ballerina take it?

24:16.792 --> 24:20.166
If she had a heart,
it would've been broken.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.250
You were in
Phoebe Curtis's workshop?

24:35.333 --> 24:36.625
Sure was.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.834
The best of the best.

24:37.917 --> 24:39.875
Couldn't find you
in the yearbook.

24:39.959 --> 24:41.917
What happened between
then and graduation?

24:42.000 --> 24:45.166
Regis wasn't preparing me
for the realities of the
biz.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.083
- So I quit.
- 'Oh, you quit, huh?'

24:48.166 --> 24:50.166
So what's this?

24:52.125 --> 24:53.542
Looks like
papers of expulsion?

24:53.625 --> 24:55.709
Yours. Nadia rats
you
out for drugs

24:55.792 --> 24:57.291
and you end up here.

24:57.375 --> 24:58.959
(Scotty)
'So where were
you, night she died?'

24:59.041 --> 25:01.375
Truth this time.

25:01.458 --> 25:05.250
I was too short for a
professional corps de ballet.

25:05.333 --> 25:08.250
Everyone tried to tell me.

25:08.333 --> 25:09.750
But I wouldn't listen.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.625
I punished myself instead.

25:12.792 --> 25:13.875
Nothing an
addict likes better than

25:13.959 --> 25:15.208
someone else to blame it on.

25:15.291 --> 25:18.333
Trust me.
My hatred was directed inward.

25:19.542 --> 25:20.792
They had already kicked me out

25:20.875 --> 25:22.583
when Nadia found me
in my dressing room.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.542
We check with the school,
they gonna confirm that story?

25:24.625 --> 25:28.417
I could care less what
the Regis faculty say about
me.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.959
Those losers couldn't do, teach

25:31.041 --> 25:33.458
or keep their
hands to themselves.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.083
(Glick)
'Think of the most painful'

25:39.166 --> 25:41.458
experience of your whole life.

25:42.834 --> 25:46.291
Boil it down
to one name.

25:48.208 --> 25:50.875
And when you're ready
say it out loud.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.959
'Shout it, if you have to.'

25:54.041 --> 25:55.500
But it's so hard to choose.

25:58.417 --> 26:00.250
I have to go.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.500
You're holding
onto something, Nadia.

26:13.583 --> 26:15.417
(Glick)
'You gotta let it go.'

26:15.500 --> 26:16.959
Holding on?

26:17.041 --> 26:18.625
I left my entire life behind.

26:18.709 --> 26:20.291
I have nothing
left to hold
onto.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.583
Except the hurt.

26:22.667 --> 26:26.166
It's come right along with you.

26:26.250 --> 26:31.291
Running away is not the same
thing as letting go.

26:31.375 --> 26:32.625
I'm trying.

26:32.709 --> 26:37.000
I've seen brilliant
performers self-destruct.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.750
'If you need my help..'

26:41.166 --> 26:42.500
...I'll be there for you.

26:42.583 --> 26:44.166
Day or night.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.792
Okay.

26:49.417 --> 26:52.000
Elliot Glick took
a special interest in
Nadia?

26:52.083 --> 26:53.917
Like a heat-seeking missile.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.125
What was in that
little, brown bottle of
his?

26:56.208 --> 26:58.750
I don't know.
Aromatherapy stuff?

26:58.834 --> 27:00.291
What'd it smell like?

27:01.959 --> 27:03.208
Minty.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.417
Said you and Nadia
didn't interact much.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.166
Want to revise
that statement?

27:11.917 --> 27:13.166
No.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.125
Been divorced twice already.

27:16.208 --> 27:17.625
Well, I don't see
what my marital
history

27:17.709 --> 27:19.709
has to do with Nadia Koslov.

27:19.792 --> 27:22.083
(Will)
'Family court
records on their way.'

27:22.166 --> 27:23.208
Might give us some insight

27:23.291 --> 27:24.542
to the cause
of all those breakups.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.417
Anything you want
to tell beforehand?

27:26.500 --> 27:27.542
I have nothing to hide.

27:27.625 --> 27:29.417
Delivery invoice
from Heart Mart

27:29.500 --> 27:31.917
your old neighborhood
health food store.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.667
Read the highlighted part.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.000
"Oil of wintergreen."

27:38.083 --> 27:40.458
- You know that it was toxic?
- 'I was careful with it.'

27:41.875 --> 27:43.375
I used it for meditating.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.542
Witnesses saw you applying it
to minors, including Nadia.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.041
'Getting handsy
with her afterwards.'

27:48.125 --> 27:50.083
I was teaching the method.

27:50.166 --> 27:51.375
I was helping my students gain

27:51.458 --> 27:54.083
an emotional
investment in their
work.

27:54.166 --> 27:56.583
I gave my soul to those kids.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.208
You were making a pass.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.083
And when she rejected
you, you made her pay.

28:00.166 --> 28:02.083
I didn't kill Nadia.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.291
But I didn't
protect her, either.

28:16.667 --> 28:18.208
Nadia.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.625
Are you alright?

28:23.834 --> 28:25.417
Katya.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.750
- Excuse me?
- 'Katya.'

28:28.834 --> 28:31.709
The name I would've
said if I had courage.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.041
Your mother.

28:36.458 --> 28:37.959
Come here.

28:45.542 --> 28:49.542
My father didn't
let me go to her
funeral.

28:50.667 --> 28:53.208
He didn't even
let me cry for
her.

28:54.542 --> 28:57.125
She was a big deal soprano

28:57.208 --> 29:00.959
so instead
of mourning, we
practiced.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.583
I'm sorry.

29:06.375 --> 29:10.417
Before we left, I
wanted
to put roses on her
grave.

29:10.500 --> 29:12.667
But now I never can.

29:14.959 --> 29:18.291
She would be
so proud of you.

29:19.625 --> 29:22.583
I just wish she
could hear what I sound
like.

29:22.667 --> 29:25.125
Not in Russia, now.

29:26.458 --> 29:29.125
Well, she can.

29:30.458 --> 29:33.458
Go ahead.
Let her hear you sing.

29:59.417 --> 30:01.375
(Leo)
'I stop by.'

30:01.458 --> 30:02.583
'You not at opera.'

30:02.667 --> 30:05.875
- They say you quit.
- Mr. Koslov.

30:05.959 --> 30:07.333
Papa! Papa!

30:07.417 --> 30:09.709
- Hold on!
- Why are you not working?

30:09.792 --> 30:14.208
- I am!
<i>podunkum?</i>

30:14.291 --> 30:16.500
Singing this rapsky,
Amerikansky, pop?

30:16.583 --> 30:18.125
My final project is due tonight

30:18.208 --> 30:20.917
and I will do it
the way that I want.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.291
There is more
to life than opera.

30:24.959 --> 30:26.667
Opera is our life.

30:28.125 --> 30:30.208
I am not her, papa.

30:31.959 --> 30:34.417
This crap school

30:34.500 --> 30:35.583
it ruins us.

30:35.667 --> 30:36.917
Us?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.458
There is no us!

30:38.542 --> 30:40.709
Just your dreams
being shoved down my throat.

30:48.166 --> 30:50.917
A parent should encourage
his child's independence.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.750
But Leo took Nadia's growth
as a personal betrayal.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.709
(Glick)
'He chased her
down the hall.'

30:56.792 --> 30:59.333
'That was the last
time I saw her.'

31:01.750 --> 31:04.500
Hey, Nick,
I got
something.

31:04.583 --> 31:07.583
A dean from St. Petersburg
Conservatory got back to
us.

31:07.667 --> 31:09.083
-Yeah?
- Back in Russia.

31:09.166 --> 31:12.500
Leo Koslov was a vocal
coach to some big
careers.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.750
- Including his wife's.
- Katya.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.917
'She gave him
a nickname and it stuck'

31:17.041 --> 31:19.083
at least in opera circles.

31:20.709 --> 31:21.959
<i>Zolotoi.</i>

31:26.291 --> 31:27.792
The Golden One.

31:27.875 --> 31:30.917
Nadia was saying a name
with her last breath.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.667
And it was her father's.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.667
Open a bottle of vodka

32:00.750 --> 32:02.875
can't leave the
table till it's done.

32:04.709 --> 32:05.959
Russian tradition?

32:06.041 --> 32:08.417
Grand pops, on my ma's side.

32:09.583 --> 32:10.667
My deyda.

32:10.750 --> 32:13.834
Left Russia and came
to this country alone.

32:17.166 --> 32:19.166
He was 14.

32:19.250 --> 32:21.250
'Wish I could ask
him more questions.'

32:21.333 --> 32:23.500
Listen to more of his stories.

32:37.083 --> 32:40.834
Never knew about your career
in the old country, Leo.

32:41.834 --> 32:44.291
'Now I do.'

32:44.375 --> 32:48.166
With her dying breath,
Nadia said your name.

32:48.250 --> 32:51.166
'The glory days of your family.'

32:51.250 --> 32:52.333
'Your career.'

32:52.417 --> 32:54.375
Your marriage.

32:54.458 --> 32:55.875
<i>Zolotoi.</i>

32:58.000 --> 33:00.125
Why did you lie to me?

33:02.291 --> 33:05.875
I thought
I could leave the past
behind.

33:05.959 --> 33:08.083
"Hamlet. Romeo and Juliet."

33:08.166 --> 33:11.709
<i>- "Lacrazy Borga."</i>
<i>- "Lucrezia Borgia."</i>

33:11.792 --> 33:12.834
The great operas.

33:12.917 --> 33:14.709
Stories all
had death by poisoning.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.875
Is that how you punished
Nadia for dishonoring you?

33:17.959 --> 33:20.375
I am one who
is punished by fate.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.333
You knew she had asthma.
You knew it would be quick.

33:23.417 --> 33:25.333
Did that take the sting out
of what you were doing?

33:25.417 --> 33:26.667
You think
I did not suffer enough?

33:26.750 --> 33:28.834
Nadia made a tape
the day she died.

33:28.917 --> 33:31.917
Empty case found
at the crime scene.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.458
You have it, Leo?

33:35.625 --> 33:39.792
Nadia had asked me
to grieve for all we had
lost.

33:41.417 --> 33:45.083
The last time I saw her
she showed me the joy

33:45.166 --> 33:47.834
that is possible
on the other side of grief.

35:41.709 --> 35:43.834
You know "Va Pensiero?"

35:43.917 --> 35:45.583
'From an opera by Verdi.'

35:45.667 --> 35:47.709
It's a famous song
about freedom

35:47.792 --> 35:50.875
and also of homesickness.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.125
The tape..

35:58.291 --> 35:59.417
It was her final project

35:59.500 --> 36:01.583
for the class that I cursed.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.291
She knew you loved her.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.333
But I never got
a chance to tell her
that.

36:13.834 --> 36:16.583
Elliot Glick's divorce
records were a goldmine.

36:16.667 --> 36:18.000
His exes
had a lot to say

36:18.083 --> 36:21.083
about his
extracurricular activities.

36:21.166 --> 36:23.417
He have a history
with his students?

36:23.500 --> 36:24.834
Phoebe Curtis.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.500
Major player
in his second divorce.

36:26.583 --> 36:28.083
Ten years on and off.

36:28.166 --> 36:29.291
Cornered his second wife

36:29.375 --> 36:31.458
in a parking garage
with a crowbar.

36:31.542 --> 36:33.250
That was just
her opening act.

36:33.333 --> 36:34.583
Would have
been threatened by Nadia

36:34.667 --> 36:36.166
once Glick had his eyes on her.

36:36.250 --> 36:38.125
Well, Glick brought
oil of wintergreen

36:38.208 --> 36:41.083
to Phoebe's apartment
for that acting thing.

36:43.083 --> 36:46.834
Date on the cassette case
is the day Nadia died.

36:46.917 --> 36:50.041
Missing tape
was her final project.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.625
She might have gone
to Phoebe's house

36:51.709 --> 36:52.709
to hand it in personally.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.125
Phoebe lived two blocks

36:54.208 --> 36:56.417
from the subway
where Nadia was found.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.750
Get her down here.

37:01.875 --> 37:03.000
Want you to think of the most

37:03.083 --> 37:05.542
painful experience in your life

37:05.625 --> 37:08.333
boil it down to a name

37:08.417 --> 37:10.667
and say it out loud.

37:12.458 --> 37:15.208
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

37:15.291 --> 37:18.125
Too hard to say
Elliot Glick's
name?

37:19.333 --> 37:21.125
Elliot and I
were friends.

37:21.208 --> 37:25.291
Such good friends you
decided to harass his
wife.

37:25.375 --> 37:29.458
Only thing you forgot was the
antifreeze and boiling bunny.

37:29.542 --> 37:31.792
(Lilly)
'What made you
so mad, Phoebe?'

37:31.875 --> 37:33.458
You think he was
forgetting about
you?

37:33.542 --> 37:36.625
He wasn't forgetting
about me. I was his muse.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.667
Sure, when you
still had
potential.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.417
But you start acting up..

37:40.500 --> 37:43.625
(Lilly)
'And he creates the
artist-in-residence
position'

37:43.709 --> 37:45.458
to keep you close.

37:45.542 --> 37:47.291
Work a little
damage control.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.959
I was a great teacher.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.375
I inspired those kids.

37:51.458 --> 37:55.542
Till Elliot found
his new muse, Nadia Koslov.

37:55.625 --> 37:56.959
(Lilly)
'Then you pull out
the oil of wintergreen'

37:57.041 --> 37:58.667
and start making your plans.

37:58.750 --> 38:01.291
Went back to your
old apartment,
Pheebs.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.834
Stuff's all over the place.

38:02.917 --> 38:05.458
Seeped through
the linoleum
floors.

38:07.625 --> 38:09.583
You're right.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.625
I had a plan.

38:11.709 --> 38:13.875
But it wasn't to kill Nadia.

39:01.709 --> 39:03.250
Elliot?

39:16.917 --> 39:18.917
I wanted to kill myself.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.917
That was my plan.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.792
But you're
sitting right
here.

39:24.959 --> 39:27.208
'Cause it wasn't
about Elliot
anymore.

39:27.291 --> 39:29.291
Not once you
heard that
tape.

39:29.375 --> 39:31.458
Nadia had found her voice.

39:31.542 --> 39:33.500
She was the real deal.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.500
Elliot knew that.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.625
So did you.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.458
That kind of talent..

39:41.542 --> 39:44.291
Made you realize
that you never had it.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.125
That hurt.

39:47.208 --> 39:49.625
Even more than
him not loving me.

39:52.625 --> 39:55.291
Until I got the idea that..

39:57.959 --> 40:00.583
...if Nadia was gone..

40:00.667 --> 40:03.208
Your problems would be too.

40:05.792 --> 40:07.750
I'm sorry.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.834
I'm so sorry.

40:24.875 --> 40:27.083
Phoebe, are you okay?

40:30.208 --> 40:32.375
It's-it's beautiful.

40:34.667 --> 40:37.667
You're the one
who taught me to feel.

40:38.834 --> 40:40.834
I felt my mother in my heart

40:40.917 --> 40:42.583
and I sang for her.

40:48.583 --> 40:51.000
Elliot says

40:51.083 --> 40:54.667
running away is not
the same thing as letting go.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.041
Maybe that's
why you're sad.

41:03.291 --> 41:05.542
I made this for myself.

41:05.625 --> 41:08.291
It's, uh, good for your throat.

41:08.375 --> 41:09.834
'You take it.'

41:09.917 --> 41:12.792
You're the real
singer in this
room.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.250
Go ahead.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.041
Thank you.

41:32.667 --> 41:35.709
Come on.
Let's get you to the train.
