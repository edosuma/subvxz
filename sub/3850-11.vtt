00:00.045 --> 00:01.484
The fact that Joss didn't get bail

00:01.509 --> 00:03.554
and can't have any
visitors is unacceptable.

00:03.578 --> 00:05.296
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"... </i>

00:05.332 --> 00:07.055
- Is Lucy home?
- No.

00:09.035 --> 00:10.352
[Exhales heavily]

00:10.377 --> 00:12.170
I will always love you, Daniel,

00:12.195 --> 00:13.482
but this is goodbye.

00:13.507 --> 00:15.247
Give this to Joss' lawyer.

00:15.272 --> 00:17.068
I think it might help.

00:17.637 --> 00:19.587
You're gonna like this.

00:21.232 --> 00:22.631
_

00:22.656 --> 00:24.740
Karen: I have something
I want to tell you both.

00:24.765 --> 00:26.266
Come on in.

00:26.942 --> 00:29.420
So, everything, uh, good with you?

00:29.575 --> 00:31.866
Uh... Yeah.

00:32.125 --> 00:33.781
I've been keeping busy.

00:36.238 --> 00:38.907
Uh... And your, uh... Your friend, uh...

00:38.932 --> 00:40.115
Joss?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.857
That hasn't been going
too well, unfortunately.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.234
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:44.724 --> 00:47.504
So... What did I miss?

00:50.994 --> 00:53.139
There's no easy way to say this,

00:53.164 --> 00:54.297
so I'm just gonna say it.

00:55.257 --> 00:56.657
[Liquid pours]

00:56.682 --> 00:57.709
I'm pregnant.

[Clatter]

01:01.290 --> 01:02.590
Alec: I, uh...

01:04.480 --> 01:05.346
Are you sure?

01:05.372 --> 01:06.806
Yeah.

01:06.831 --> 01:08.616
I went to the doctor about something else.

01:08.641 --> 01:10.108
We did a blood test.

01:10.133 --> 01:12.693
I was as shocked as you are, obviously.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.608
And you're...

01:14.633 --> 01:16.935
Sure that it's, um...

01:16.960 --> 01:19.036
Yes. It's yours.

01:20.946 --> 01:23.195
Ours. Ours.

01:24.436 --> 01:26.938
Um, I thought you were...

01:27.530 --> 01:28.754
Aren't you on the pill?

01:28.779 --> 01:30.764
I was, but as it turns out,

01:30.789 --> 01:34.075
one in 11 women get pregnant
while on the pill every year.

01:34.347 --> 01:35.213
Who knew?

01:35.238 --> 01:36.499
<i>I</i> certainly did not.

01:36.757 --> 01:38.036
Me neither.

01:38.069 --> 01:39.653
Me neither.

01:39.686 --> 01:42.083
You're telling us, so you're...

01:42.429 --> 01:43.721
Obviously keeping it.

01:43.746 --> 01:45.059
Are you happy?

01:45.084 --> 01:47.386
Yes. I am... <i> now.</i>

01:47.500 --> 01:50.114
As I said, it wasn't my first reaction.

01:50.262 --> 01:52.481
I needed time to come to this decision,

01:52.506 --> 01:54.099
which is why I'm telling <i>
you</i> right away...

01:54.124 --> 01:55.745
To give you both enough time

01:55.770 --> 01:58.246
to decide if you want to be involved.

01:58.899 --> 02:00.516
Or not.

02:00.728 --> 02:02.862
It's okay either way.

02:02.887 --> 02:05.178
Thank you for... For telling us,

02:05.203 --> 02:07.018
and we'll... We'll talk
about it, obviously.

02:07.043 --> 02:09.050
I think I'm in shock.

02:09.270 --> 02:12.699
Alec and I haven't talked
about kids for so long, and...

02:12.724 --> 02:14.075
Well, maybe you and I should...

02:14.100 --> 02:15.434
can I finish a thought, please?

02:15.459 --> 02:16.492
I'm gonna go.

02:16.517 --> 02:18.376
You say that we're
gonna discuss this later,

02:18.401 --> 02:19.878
but I have a feeling that
the second she leaves,

02:19.903 --> 02:21.018
the conversation's over.

02:21.043 --> 02:22.034
Now, that is not true.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.307
You've never wanted kids.

02:23.332 --> 02:24.689
Oh, God. Don't start this again.

02:24.714 --> 02:26.167
I didn't "start" that again.

02:26.192 --> 02:28.967
Now all of a sudden,
you're happy about this?

I thought you'd like it.

I love it.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.231
So, your trip was good?

02:55.256 --> 02:57.357
It was fine. I missed you, though.

Aww. [Giggles]

02:59.551 --> 03:01.545
Uh, so, how was <i> your</i> week?

03:01.626 --> 03:04.146
Anything exciting happen while I was gone?

03:05.234 --> 03:08.467
Oh, well, you know, all the
stuff with Joss happened.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.849
Oh, my God. That's right. Uh, how is she?

03:10.874 --> 03:12.427
Holding up as best she can.

03:12.452 --> 03:14.677
I think we finally get to see her tomorrow.

03:15.547 --> 03:17.834
So, you liked Seattle, huh?

03:17.859 --> 03:19.977
Oh, I loved it. You know,
and <i> you</i> would, too.

You know...

03:21.273 --> 03:22.479
Midterm break's coming up.

03:22.504 --> 03:23.955
Maybe we can take a little vacation.

03:24.012 --> 03:25.686
That sounds like fun.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.021
I mean, I'd have to figure out
what to do about Lucy, but...

03:28.046 --> 03:29.607
Or we could bring her.

03:29.632 --> 03:31.420
The three of us could
use a little bonding trip.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.233
Plus, I think she'd really enjoy it.

03:33.325 --> 03:34.738
[Laughs] I'm sure she would,

03:34.763 --> 03:36.848
but the simple fact that
I'm the one bringing it up...

03:36.964 --> 03:39.090
Oh, you know she's just
gonna make that face, right?

03:39.115 --> 03:41.677
Then why don't you just make
us one of your fantastic dinners

03:41.702 --> 03:42.869
and <i> I'll</i> pitch it to Lucy?

05:21.234 --> 05:22.326
at the time of the murder.

Oh, my...

05:23.140 --> 05:24.326
Thank you, time stamp.

05:24.351 --> 05:27.443
So you see? I told you I knew
that she did it, David. I knew it!

05:27.468 --> 05:29.896
To be clear, this doesn't
prove that Calista killed Luca,

05:29.921 --> 05:32.451
but it <i> does</i> call
her alibi into question.

05:32.513 --> 05:35.201
It's the first step to
taking her down, Joss.

05:35.226 --> 05:37.568
Oh, my God. Finally! Thank God.

05:37.593 --> 05:39.826
Where... Where did you get this tape?

05:39.851 --> 05:41.529
Uh, it's from the
neighbor's security camera

05:41.554 --> 05:42.454
across the street.

05:42.479 --> 05:43.404
Are you kidding me?

05:43.429 --> 05:45.256
Why the hell didn't the cops
look at those cameras before?

05:45.281 --> 05:47.365
They weren't looking for
someone <i> leaving</i> the house.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.358
They believed the murderer was
already <i> in</i> the house.

06:10.898 --> 06:12.716
Wait. Harry... Harry came to you?

06:12.741 --> 06:15.029
He did. But it's only if
you <i> want</i> to see him.

No, no, I-I-I want to see him.

06:16.796 --> 06:18.428
I <i> definitely</i> want to see him.

06:18.453 --> 06:19.628
Okay.

06:19.653 --> 06:21.428
Done.

06:22.595 --> 06:25.818

06:43.421 --> 06:44.341
Never heard of him.

06:44.367 --> 06:47.077

far, I am not that impressed.

06:47.101 --> 06:48.373

09:34.103 --> 09:36.204
not being able to see you, talk to you.

09:36.229 --> 09:37.296
I, um...

09:37.543 --> 09:38.643
[Inhales deeply]

09:38.668 --> 09:40.236
I know you're probably still furious at me

09:40.261 --> 09:41.962
over the whole Niko
thing, and I'm so sorry...

09:41.987 --> 09:42.902
Don't... Don't...

09:42.927 --> 09:44.160
It meant nothing. I swear.

09:44.185 --> 09:45.466
Harry, stop. It's...

09:45.491 --> 09:48.513
It doesn't mean anything. I
know. None of that matters.

09:48.538 --> 09:49.919
It's... It doesn't matter.

09:49.944 --> 09:51.545
All that matters is that...

09:51.570 --> 09:52.841
Is that you're here, okay?

09:52.866 --> 09:53.989
Yeah.

09:54.554 --> 09:56.188
Okay.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.435
I still don't understand
why <i> you're</i> here.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.068
I mean, how the hell did this happen?

10:00.093 --> 10:01.560
I-I heard you were...

10:01.585 --> 10:03.302
In bed with a guy or something?

10:03.327 --> 10:04.287
No, no, no, it was...

10:04.312 --> 10:05.612
It was absolutely nothing like that.

10:05.637 --> 10:08.083
It was a <i> really</i> stupid plan.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.177
I was just trying to help
Calista with her divorce,

10:10.202 --> 10:12.146
and... Ugh... It's been a nightmare, Harry,

10:12.171 --> 10:13.572
that I really don't want to relive.

10:13.597 --> 10:14.623
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.841
But you know what... The good news is,

10:15.866 --> 10:16.966
it looks like it's gonna be over soon.

10:17.099 --> 10:18.943
That's... Well, great.
What does that mean exactly?

10:18.968 --> 10:20.702
There's been, you know,
a break in the case.

10:20.727 --> 10:21.894
David said that he found out

10:21.919 --> 10:23.927
that Calista's whole alibi was a lie,

10:23.952 --> 10:25.521
so I should be getting out of here soon.

10:25.546 --> 10:26.701
[Sighs] When?

10:26.726 --> 10:29.131
Well, it's... It's a whole process.

10:29.155 --> 10:30.188
You wouldn't believe

10:30.213 --> 10:32.060
how long some of these
women wait to go to trial.

10:32.085 --> 10:32.787
It's just...

10:32.812 --> 10:35.900
Yeah, but you're not like
the other women in here.

10:35.925 --> 10:38.494
Joss, are you sure this
David guy's the best lawyer?

10:38.519 --> 10:41.185
Uh, well... He's been good so far.

10:41.210 --> 10:42.244
He found the security tape,

10:42.269 --> 10:43.865
a-and I think he's
doing everything he can.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.064
If he was doing everything he could,

10:45.089 --> 10:45.826
he would have gotten the tape

10:45.851 --> 10:47.529
<i>before</i> you were incarcerated, right?

10:47.554 --> 10:49.989
I mean, where did you even find
him? What's his record like?

10:50.014 --> 10:51.317
Uh, his record? I don't...

10:51.342 --> 10:53.077
- Because if it's about the money, you know...
- Harry.

10:53.102 --> 10:54.318
No, if we can find you a better lawyer,

10:54.343 --> 10:55.359
you know I'll pay for it.

10:55.384 --> 10:56.982
I'd do anything for you, you know.

10:57.007 --> 11:00.209
I know you would. And I love you for that.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.825
I love you.

11:04.505 --> 11:06.722
Guard: Time's up.

11:18.279 --> 11:20.977
So, I'll pick you up tomorrow,
and we can go together.

11:21.002 --> 11:23.563
Waze is saying it may take over an hour.

11:23.588 --> 11:24.868
I can't wait to see her.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.962
Feels like she's been in there forever.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.337
I know. [Sighs]

11:28.362 --> 11:29.650
I wish we could bring her something,

11:29.674 --> 11:31.477
but there's so many rules.

11:31.502 --> 11:32.742
Ooh!

11:32.767 --> 11:33.899
What are you doing?

11:33.924 --> 11:35.399
Deboning a duck.

11:35.424 --> 11:38.315
[Sighs] Make that
<i>"trying</i> to debone a duck."

11:38.340 --> 11:41.225
I'm attempting a Julia child recipe.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.868
I am on my second duck.

11:42.893 --> 11:44.076
Why?

11:44.101 --> 11:46.067
Blair's coming over for
dinner tomorrow night.

11:46.092 --> 11:47.884
Feels like the least I can do

11:47.909 --> 11:51.261
after... Having sex with someone else.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.696
So you didn't tell him?

11:52.721 --> 11:54.298
I <i> swear</i> I was going to,

11:54.323 --> 11:56.861
but then he came back all happy to see me,

11:56.885 --> 11:57.758
with presents.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.685
I j... I just couldn't.

11:59.710 --> 12:01.061
So this is a guilt duck?

12:01.086 --> 12:04.338
Oh, it's a mother-ducking
nightmare, is what it is.

12:04.363 --> 12:06.384
I practically lost a finger already.

12:06.775 --> 12:08.108
I've never cheated before.

12:08.133 --> 12:10.329
It just... It just feels awful.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.181
Don't be so hard on yourself, sweetie.

12:12.205 --> 12:13.406
People make mistakes,

12:13.431 --> 12:15.298
and you're still very
early in your relationship.

12:15.323 --> 12:16.219
He may understand.

12:16.244 --> 12:17.516
- [Microwave beeps]
- After I saw him,

12:17.541 --> 12:19.641
I thought, "maybe it would be better

12:19.666 --> 12:21.289
if I <i> don't</i> tell him," you know?

12:21.315 --> 12:23.235
But isn't that what all cheaters say

12:23.260 --> 12:24.633
to avoid doing the hard thing?

12:24.659 --> 12:25.979
Depends.

12:26.004 --> 12:26.903
On what?

12:26.928 --> 12:28.743
On whether you're in it with this guy

12:28.768 --> 12:30.118
for the long haul or not.

12:30.315 --> 12:31.610
[Doorbell rings]

12:31.635 --> 12:32.844
Ooh. Someone's at my door.

12:32.869 --> 12:33.922
Can I call you back?

12:33.948 --> 12:34.781
Oh!

12:34.806 --> 12:36.866
[Groans angrily]

12:38.003 --> 12:39.637
I need to get another duck.

12:39.743 --> 12:41.842
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.571
I'm a jerk, starting a
stupid fight with Alec

12:48.596 --> 12:50.016
and acting all weird.

12:50.041 --> 12:51.164
You didn't act weird.

12:51.190 --> 12:52.223
I didn't act <i> nice.</i>

12:52.248 --> 12:53.915
Pregnancy's supposed to be a happy thing.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.282
Under the circumstances...

12:55.307 --> 12:57.827
I <i> am</i> happy for you, Karen.

12:58.264 --> 13:00.430
[Both sigh]

13:00.478 --> 13:03.329
Obviously, your news completely threw us.

13:03.354 --> 13:05.540
I know. It threw <i> me,</i> too.

13:05.565 --> 13:07.774
[Sighs] But it also...

13:07.799 --> 13:11.527
Brought up a lot of emotional stuff for me.

13:12.207 --> 13:14.962
The truth is, we <i> did</i> kind of try.

13:14.987 --> 13:17.165
A few years ago, I went off birth control,

13:17.190 --> 13:19.267
but then I got sick.

13:19.292 --> 13:20.704
I'm so sorry.

13:20.729 --> 13:21.727
It is what it is,

13:21.753 --> 13:23.814
but I have always wanted to be a mother,

13:23.838 --> 13:26.039
and I think I'd be a
pretty damn good one, too.

13:26.064 --> 13:27.401
So do I.

13:27.426 --> 13:29.894
But I'm not an idiot, Karen.

13:29.919 --> 13:31.634
I know there's none of <i> me</i> in there.

13:31.659 --> 13:33.220
I've got no genetic material in the mix.

13:33.245 --> 13:35.173
That's not what I think, and you know it.

13:35.198 --> 13:39.040
This baby was conceived out
of love by <i> all</i> of us.

13:39.065 --> 13:41.071
It's as much yours as it is mine...

13:41.096 --> 13:42.899
if you want to be a part of its life.

13:42.924 --> 13:43.958
I do.

13:43.983 --> 13:45.782
And I <i> know</i> that Alec does, too.

13:45.815 --> 13:47.743
It's just hard for him
to process all of this.

13:47.768 --> 13:49.602
It's gonna take him a
little longer, I think.

13:49.628 --> 13:52.259
Well, that's where the "nine
months" thing comes in handy.

13:52.284 --> 13:53.918
[Both chuckle]

13:53.943 --> 13:55.313
[Inhales]

13:55.338 --> 13:56.605
What?

13:57.389 --> 13:59.604
If he does come around...

13:59.629 --> 14:02.353
What would say to us all
raising the baby together,

14:02.378 --> 14:03.397
under one roof?

14:03.442 --> 14:04.643
I thought...

14:04.920 --> 14:06.892
You were thinking about separating.

14:06.917 --> 14:09.218
That was just a blip...

14:09.243 --> 14:11.111
Fallout from our breakup,

14:11.136 --> 14:13.010
because, honestly, Karen,

14:13.034 --> 14:16.103
we were our happiest when we were with you.

14:16.564 --> 14:19.228
I feel like this baby is the universe

14:19.253 --> 14:22.505
showing us that we're
supposed to all be together.

14:22.530 --> 14:24.814
But I would <i> never</i> pressure you.

14:24.839 --> 14:27.446
Maybe we can all talk about
it tomorrow night over dinner?

14:27.592 --> 14:29.871
Our place?

14:31.508 --> 14:32.724
Okay.

14:32.749 --> 14:34.650
[Sighs]

14:38.119 --> 14:39.786
[Sighs]

14:42.262 --> 14:43.801
Julia child?

14:43.826 --> 14:45.309
- That's hardcore.
- [Sighs]

14:45.363 --> 14:46.513
Did you debone a duck?

14:46.538 --> 14:48.504
Not successfully.

14:48.549 --> 14:51.778
I am now on my fourth freakin' duck.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.262
This is why I don't normally do recipes

14:53.287 --> 14:54.825
that involve a day's worth of prep.

14:54.850 --> 14:56.001
Well, you want a little help?

14:56.278 --> 14:57.497
From you?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.341
Hey, ever since Harry
bumped me up to sous-chef,

14:59.365 --> 15:00.918
I've picked up all kinds of mad skills.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.385
Here. Move over.

15:06.133 --> 15:07.674
Hmm?

15:11.832 --> 15:13.273
Huh.

15:13.298 --> 15:15.377
I assume all this is for Blair?

15:15.402 --> 15:16.618
Yep.

15:17.081 --> 15:18.820
Well, he's one lucky guy.

15:19.263 --> 15:20.563
Mm.

15:21.946 --> 15:24.062
Eww. Smells gross in here.

15:24.087 --> 15:26.822
Oh, that's the balsamic reduction sauce...

15:26.847 --> 15:27.781
Burning.

15:27.806 --> 15:29.007
What's all this for?

15:29.032 --> 15:30.327
[Smoke alarm beeping]

15:30.352 --> 15:33.654
Oh, this is all for our dinner
with Blair tomorrow night.

15:33.679 --> 15:35.796
- [Beeping stops]
- I'm making his favorite meal.

15:35.821 --> 15:37.718
Yeah, I'll be going out
with Marc and Scotty.

15:37.743 --> 15:38.570
[Marc laughs]

15:38.595 --> 15:40.133
No, you'll be dining with us.

15:40.157 --> 15:42.725
Whatever. Dinner probably won't
even be <i> ready</i> by tomorrow.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.602
Oh, my... Why does there always
have to be attitude with you?

15:45.627 --> 15:47.658
Just get upstairs and do your homework.

15:47.683 --> 15:48.683
Now!

15:48.708 --> 15:50.325
[Sighs deeply]

15:52.405 --> 15:53.968
Are you okay?

15:53.993 --> 15:55.527
I'm just tense, Marc.

15:55.552 --> 15:57.676
Very tense.

15:58.036 --> 16:01.277
[Telephone ringing]

16:05.527 --> 16:07.828
[Telephone beeps]

16:07.853 --> 16:08.803
Hello?

16:08.828 --> 16:09.861
Man: Calista Raines?

16:09.886 --> 16:11.720
Who is this? How did you get this number?

16:11.745 --> 16:13.379
Yeah, I'm a reporter from the <i> Times.</i>

16:13.404 --> 16:16.147
Do you have any comment on
the newly released videotape?

16:16.172 --> 16:17.552
What... What tape?

16:17.577 --> 16:20.312
No... No, do not call here again.

16:20.337 --> 16:21.697
[Telephone beeps]

16:25.975 --> 16:27.120
[Cellphone rings]

16:27.145 --> 16:27.966
Patty.

16:27.991 --> 16:30.378
W-w-why do I have
some people calling me

16:30.403 --> 16:32.104
about... Some tape or something?

16:32.129 --> 16:35.122
I've been trying to call you,
but your cellphone's been off.

16:35.146 --> 16:36.667
I've been... Working.

16:36.692 --> 16:39.050
Well,<i> stop</i> working
and pull up any website.

16:39.074 --> 16:40.241
It's all over the place.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.794
I'm on my way over there now.

16:46.686 --> 16:49.821
<i>You know, I'm not surprised
Calista Raines did this.</i>

16:49.846 --> 16:53.370
<i>She is a hateful
and vindictive woman</i>

16:53.395 --> 16:56.180
<i>who tried to rip me
apart from my sweet Luca,</i>

16:56.205 --> 16:58.116
<i>only to kill him.</i>

16:59.101 --> 17:01.037
[Mouse clicks]

17:01.426 --> 17:04.714
[Keyboard clacks]

17:12.082 --> 17:15.895
Patty, for the last time, that is not me.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.277
That is not my car.

17:17.301 --> 17:18.348
It <i> is</i> your car.

17:18.373 --> 17:20.473
Patty, it is a silver Range Rover.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.667
I understand that.

17:21.693 --> 17:23.527
But it's not <i>my</i> silver Range Rover.

17:23.551 --> 17:25.542
You do understand they made more than one?

17:25.568 --> 17:27.002
But it's driving down your driveway

17:27.027 --> 17:28.113
a-and through your gate.

17:28.137 --> 17:29.318
And <i> that</i> is your ring.

17:29.343 --> 17:31.270
Yes, yes, that's my ring,

17:31.295 --> 17:32.801
and someone's in my clothes,

17:32.826 --> 17:34.694
and someone's driving down my driveway,

17:34.719 --> 17:36.199
but that's not me, Patty.

17:36.224 --> 17:37.926
- It's not me.
- Because you were at the Ace Hotel

17:37.951 --> 17:39.571
with Denise that night?

17:43.132 --> 17:45.270
Oh, damn it, Calista.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.581
Patty. Listen.

17:47.606 --> 17:48.871
Listen to me, please.

17:48.896 --> 17:51.348
I <i> was</i> at the ace hotel. I was there.

17:51.373 --> 17:53.970
I just wasn't with Denise, I was alone.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.566
You have got to tell me <i>everything.</i>

18:01.808 --> 18:03.492
- Right now.
- Okay.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.434
Let's start with what
the hell you were doing

18:05.459 --> 18:08.450
at a bar alone downtown
at 1:00 in the morning.

18:10.004 --> 18:12.624
Everything that Joss said was true.

18:12.649 --> 18:15.027
We just wanted to trap him.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.769
She was supposed to seduce him.

18:16.794 --> 18:18.345
We were gonna get it on video,

18:18.370 --> 18:19.910
and then I could divorce him.

18:19.935 --> 18:21.574
Believe me, I know how that sounds.

18:21.599 --> 18:22.566
I don't think you do.

18:22.591 --> 18:24.592
I d... Uh... Patty. I understand.

18:24.617 --> 18:26.503
Why do you think I haven't
said anything to anybody?

18:26.528 --> 18:28.879
I was at Joss'. I started to get antsy.

18:28.904 --> 18:30.691
I went down to the ace, I had a drink,

18:30.716 --> 18:33.368
and by the time I got back,
there were cops everywhere...

18:33.393 --> 18:35.036
And Luca was dead.

18:35.456 --> 18:37.387
So you think Joss did it?

18:37.412 --> 18:39.032
I-I-I think...

18:39.057 --> 18:41.809
I think whoever did it is on that tape

18:41.834 --> 18:44.754
and they're pretending to be me
and they're trying to trap me.

18:44.779 --> 18:47.160
I think that's who did it,
and I think it's Eva Petrov.

18:47.185 --> 18:49.332
Patty, you got to do something about this.

18:49.357 --> 18:50.423
Please!

18:50.448 --> 18:52.682
I will investigate Eva's alibi, but look...

18:52.707 --> 18:54.592
In the meantime, the
court of public opinion

18:54.617 --> 18:56.475
is turning against you... Right?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.060
Whoever leaked this tape to the press

18:58.085 --> 18:59.238
knew exactly what they were doing.

18:59.263 --> 19:01.457
I've been fielding calls
from nervous vendors all day.

19:01.482 --> 19:02.451
Are you kidding?

19:02.476 --> 19:05.014
No, it's all right. It's
okay. I-I-I-I'm fixing it.

19:05.371 --> 19:07.555
I've reached out to Diane Sawyer's people.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.748
You grieving, Diane, America.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.742
If you cry hard enough for
your dear, departed husband,

19:12.767 --> 19:14.951
America might just forget this video

19:14.976 --> 19:17.095
of you driving down your driveway.

19:20.757 --> 19:23.951
[Crying] That's not me
driving down the driveway.

19:23.976 --> 19:26.457
Patty, you know I didn't do this.

19:26.482 --> 19:27.934
Right?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.276
Yeah.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.898
'Course I know that.

19:37.002 --> 19:39.289
I'm 10 minutes away, April.

19:39.314 --> 19:42.416
Yeah, bring the cupcakes just in case.

19:50.448 --> 19:52.656
[Horn blaring]

19:52.681 --> 19:55.055
[Horns blaring]

19:57.780 --> 19:59.999
[Horn blares]

20:02.546 --> 20:04.814
[Buzzer, gate clanks]

20:04.839 --> 20:06.582
Okay, so, you're pregnant,

20:06.607 --> 20:08.246
you slept with Daniel,

20:08.271 --> 20:09.538
you're keeping the baby,

20:09.571 --> 20:11.698
- and you didn't tell Blair.
- Mm.

20:11.929 --> 20:13.918
Seriously, how long
have I been in the hole?

20:13.943 --> 20:15.510
Okay, we have given you all of our gossip,

20:15.535 --> 20:18.363
and, uh, that guard is about
to kick us out in five minutes.

20:18.388 --> 20:19.668
So quick... Tell us about <i> you.</i>

20:19.693 --> 20:20.559
How are you?

20:20.584 --> 20:21.801
Oh, I'm horrible.

20:21.826 --> 20:23.356
I mean, look at me, right?

20:23.381 --> 20:24.598
Normally, I rock a jumpsuit.

20:24.623 --> 20:25.996
I don't think I'll ever look at a romper

20:26.021 --> 20:27.074
the same way again, you guys.

20:27.099 --> 20:29.332
Aww. At least you've still
got your sense of humor.

20:29.357 --> 20:31.887
Yeah. Not really. I'm dead inside.

20:31.912 --> 20:32.964
[Scoffs] Don't say that.

20:32.989 --> 20:34.556
David thinks you're
getting out of here soon.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.035
What the hell does <i> he</i> know, right?

20:36.060 --> 20:37.419
I thought you liked David.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.377
I do.

20:38.402 --> 20:40.132
I mean... I <i> think</i> I do.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.879
I just... I... I don't know.

20:41.904 --> 20:44.184
Harry got in my head, and I just realized

20:44.209 --> 20:46.996
I know absolutely nothing about this guy.

20:47.021 --> 20:49.090
Does he ever actually <i> win</i> in court?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.432
Does he ever actually <i> get</i> to court?

20:50.457 --> 20:51.621
He has a solid record.

20:51.646 --> 20:52.801
And I don't know if it matters,

20:52.826 --> 20:54.621
but as soon as Daniel got
him that security tape,

20:54.646 --> 20:56.184
- he was all over it.
- Wait, wait, wait.

20:56.209 --> 20:58.481
I thought that David got
the tape from the police.

20:58.506 --> 21:00.379
No, the police never requested it,

21:00.404 --> 21:02.293
so Daniel used his FBI connections

21:02.318 --> 21:04.129
and pulled a few strings.

21:04.154 --> 21:05.653
So <i> Daniel</i> got the tape?

21:05.678 --> 21:07.247
Well, yeah. Does that matter?

21:07.271 --> 21:09.058
Well, I don't know, but it...

21:09.083 --> 21:11.809
Ugggh. Anyway. It's... I don't...

21:11.840 --> 21:13.653
Can we just go back to the good stuff?

21:13.678 --> 21:15.895
How about you... Beautiful, pregnant lady.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.559
[Laughing] What? Come on.

21:17.584 --> 21:19.986
So, what... Are you gonna
raise the baby alone, or...

21:20.011 --> 21:21.662
Are Alec and Vivian involved?

21:21.687 --> 21:25.572
Vivian wants to be, and
maybe Alec would, too, but...

21:25.699 --> 21:27.072
But... ?

21:27.097 --> 21:28.572
It's just so complicated.

21:28.597 --> 21:31.481
Our relationship already
fell apart once before,

21:31.506 --> 21:33.458
and we all know having a kid
doesn't make things easier.

21:33.482 --> 21:35.176
- Mm.
- That's very true.

21:35.201 --> 21:37.995
Plus, Vivian might be having an affair.

21:38.848 --> 21:40.832
I saw her with a man.

21:40.857 --> 21:41.845
Naked?

21:42.164 --> 21:44.845
No. It was just a lunch.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.244
But it seemed emotional.

21:47.269 --> 21:49.404
That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

21:49.429 --> 21:50.934
Just... Can't you just ask her?

21:50.959 --> 21:52.543
I don't want to ask her. That's the point.

21:52.568 --> 21:54.669
I don't want to be in the
middle of their marriage anymore.

21:54.694 --> 21:56.261
Three people... it's just too much.

21:56.286 --> 21:59.551
[Sighs] I almost wish I'd never
told them about the baby at all.

21:59.576 --> 22:01.364
- Well, you know I think about...
- Guard: Time's up, Carver.

22:01.389 --> 22:02.520
[Whimpers]

22:02.545 --> 22:03.879
[Sighs]

22:03.904 --> 22:05.270
Stupid prison.

22:05.295 --> 22:06.810
- I love you guys.
- Love you.

22:06.834 --> 22:08.754
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:17.443 --> 22:20.348
It's okay. I adjusted the oven
20 minutes ago. You're good.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.489
Oh, my God. [Laughing] Thank you.

22:21.514 --> 22:23.473
I also whipped up some sweet potato fries

22:23.498 --> 22:25.004
just in case Lucy doesn't like the duck.

22:25.029 --> 22:26.546
Oh, she'll be eating the duck.

22:26.571 --> 22:28.489
Well, sometimes, kids
don't love fancy food.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.731
Remember... It's an acquired taste,

22:29.756 --> 22:31.907
like coffee or investing for retirement.

22:31.932 --> 22:32.732
[Chuckles]

22:32.963 --> 22:34.814
Uh, listen, uh..

22:34.839 --> 22:36.575
Oh. You might want to consider

22:36.600 --> 22:38.247
going a little easy on Lucy tonight.

22:38.272 --> 22:40.301
I don't know if I should be
the one to tell you this, but...

22:40.326 --> 22:41.653
She doesn't really like Blair.

22:41.678 --> 22:43.114
Oh. [Laughs]

22:43.139 --> 22:44.528
I am well aware of that fact.

22:44.553 --> 22:45.981
She already told me.

22:46.006 --> 22:46.989
Oh, really?

22:47.014 --> 22:48.981
Would've thought that would've
been kind of a deal-breaker.

22:49.006 --> 22:51.278
Well, it would be if
she had a valid reason.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.340
But I know <i> exactly</i>
why Lucy doesn't like Blair.

22:53.365 --> 22:54.793
It's because he is the first man

22:54.819 --> 22:56.353
who has been an authoritative figure

22:56.378 --> 22:57.712
in her life since Paul's death.

22:57.976 --> 22:59.893
Blair sets rules. Lucy hates rules.

22:59.918 --> 23:01.010
<i>Every</i> kid does.

23:01.035 --> 23:02.369
Yeah, I don't think that's it, April.

23:02.395 --> 23:03.229
I think Lucy has some...

23:03.254 --> 23:05.588
- [Cabinet door slams]
- I... Like Blair.

23:05.613 --> 23:08.314
He is kind, he's thoughtful, he's smart.

23:08.339 --> 23:09.789
Quite a list you got going.

23:09.814 --> 23:12.597
I like lists, too. You
got a problem with that?

23:18.111 --> 23:20.109
David: So, if you left Karen's at 9:30,

23:20.134 --> 23:21.742
Calista most likely followed
you back to the house...

23:21.767 --> 23:23.680
- I mean, obviously, without your knowledge.
- Obviously.

23:23.705 --> 23:25.563
A-and the reason she
didn't answer your texts

23:25.588 --> 23:26.782
when you were in the bathroom

23:26.806 --> 23:28.390
was because either she was too smart...

23:28.416 --> 23:30.406
She knew that a response
would ping the cell towers,

23:30.431 --> 23:32.094
placing her at the
scene of the crime, or...

23:32.119 --> 23:34.836
I doubt that Calista knows
anything about cell towers, or...

23:34.861 --> 23:36.352
It doesn't matter what Calista knows.

23:36.377 --> 23:38.211
The jury just needs to
believe it's possible.

23:38.236 --> 23:39.922
Right.

23:40.855 --> 23:42.523
Is something wrong?

23:42.658 --> 23:44.759
How did you get the tape?

23:44.784 --> 23:46.534
It came from April's friend.

23:46.811 --> 23:49.359
Oh. Uh, well, why didn't you tell me that?

23:49.384 --> 23:51.018
I didn't think it mattered.

23:51.043 --> 23:52.570
Well, it <i> wouldn't</i>
have mattered if you told me,

23:52.595 --> 23:54.000
but the fact that you
didn't, it's... It's weird.

23:54.025 --> 23:55.625
It's like you were keeping
it from me or something

23:55.650 --> 23:57.237
so that you could take the credit.

23:57.262 --> 23:58.453
Yeah, t-t-that's not...

23:58.478 --> 24:00.429
And why am I still in here, David?

24:00.468 --> 24:02.847
There's tape of Calista
leaving the scene of the crime

24:02.872 --> 24:04.006
a-at the time of the crime,

24:04.031 --> 24:06.128
and she had an actual motive
to murder him, whereas...

24:06.153 --> 24:08.495
What, my spotty lesbionic
past is a stretch, at best.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.159
Joss...

24:09.184 --> 24:10.464
And she's still out there,
and I'm still in here,

24:10.489 --> 24:13.375
so I'm just... Are you doing
everything that you can do?

24:13.463 --> 24:15.144
W-what's happening right now?

24:15.169 --> 24:17.385
I'm just asking some
basic questions, you know?

24:17.424 --> 24:18.924
Because Harry and I were
talking and I just...

24:18.949 --> 24:21.623
Harry. Now that makes sense.

24:22.823 --> 24:24.683
Wait. No, I'm sorry. David, don't go.

24:24.708 --> 24:26.574
I gave you fair warning
that the system is slow.

24:26.598 --> 24:28.716
Yesterday, I spent half my day on the phone

24:28.741 --> 24:31.026
getting that tape to
the right people at TMZ,

24:31.051 --> 24:32.308
'cause, apparently, there
are <i> wrong</i> people

24:32.333 --> 24:33.808
to leak tapes to at TMZ.

24:33.833 --> 24:35.602
Wait, I...

24:35.927 --> 24:37.081
[sighs]

24:37.106 --> 24:38.714
You're the one that leaked
the tape to the press?

24:38.739 --> 24:40.245
Who do you <i> think</i> did it?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.964
Joss, I've been eating, sleeping, breathing

24:42.989 --> 24:44.542
you and your case since the day we met.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.284
But if that's not enough for you,

24:46.309 --> 24:48.269
you should find yourself another lawyer.

24:48.294 --> 24:50.433
David...

24:58.972 --> 25:00.139
[Doorbell rings]

25:01.613 --> 25:02.613
Alec: Hey.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.498
You're early.

25:06.523 --> 25:08.118
I haven't even started cooking yet.

25:08.586 --> 25:10.020
It's okay. I'm not staying.

25:10.055 --> 25:11.539
Karen. Hi.

25:12.671 --> 25:14.358
Is everything okay?

25:14.442 --> 25:15.659
[Inhales deeply] No.

25:15.727 --> 25:17.227
The whole purpose of this dinner

25:17.278 --> 25:19.162
was to talk about the possibility

25:19.213 --> 25:20.867
of raising the baby together,

25:20.892 --> 25:22.562
but after thinking about it, I don't think

25:22.587 --> 25:24.674
we need a whole dinner to discuss it.

25:25.541 --> 25:27.203
I don't think it's gonna work out.

25:27.228 --> 25:28.494
Karen, please, just come in.

25:28.519 --> 25:30.457
Like I said, I've given
this a lot of thought,

25:30.482 --> 25:32.350
and I just don't feel
comfortable with it now.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.624
Why now? W-what's changed?

25:34.707 --> 25:36.306
I'm sorry.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.130
We'll have the French fries,
the jumbo shrimp cocktail,

25:46.155 --> 25:47.055
and... ?

25:47.080 --> 25:48.802
Um, do they have Mac and cheese?

25:48.827 --> 25:51.437
[Laughs] Well, the Mac and cheese is
<i>truffle</i> Mac and cheese, buddy.

25:51.462 --> 25:52.333
You might not like it.

25:52.358 --> 25:53.241
I will.

25:53.266 --> 25:54.933
This is all free, right?

25:54.958 --> 25:56.745
Yeah. You're good.

25:58.226 --> 25:59.779
Do you have a problem with me?

25:59.804 --> 26:01.905
[Sighs] Uh, no, not personally.

26:01.930 --> 26:03.197
Because I'm doing a good job.

26:03.222 --> 26:06.095
Whether you understand it
or not, I am helping Joss.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.731
You messing with Joss's
head... That's hurting her.

26:07.756 --> 26:08.854
I'm not messing with her head.

26:08.879 --> 26:10.623
No, no, you're trying
to control a situation

26:10.648 --> 26:13.256
in which you have no
control... Except you <i> do.</i>

26:13.280 --> 26:15.185
Because everything you say affects her.

26:15.210 --> 26:16.744
And right now, Joss is scared

26:16.769 --> 26:18.279
because <i> you</i> put doubts in her mind

26:18.304 --> 26:19.419
whereas before, there <i> were</i> none.

26:19.444 --> 26:21.262
Okay, if you're trying to
piss me off, it's working.

26:21.287 --> 26:22.083
Not at all.

26:22.108 --> 26:24.795
Harry, we're on the same team.

top of the Space Needle

26:32.510 --> 26:34.111

26:34.136 --> 26:36.795
And I was thinking we'd
stay right downtown.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.263
We can walk to a Ferris
wheel right on the waterfront.

26:39.288 --> 26:42.307

some of the best shopping ever.

go skiing with her family.

27:06.074 --> 27:07.916

28:56.216 --> 28:57.136
Well, what do you...

28:57.161 --> 28:58.761
She was disrespectful to you.

28:58.855 --> 29:00.902
She needs time to think about that.

29:00.927 --> 29:02.324
For what it's worth,

29:02.349 --> 29:04.363
I-I don't think your
reaction was so terrible.

29:04.388 --> 29:06.801
How can you say that? I was out of control.

29:06.825 --> 29:08.808
Y-you weren't. It was a reflex.

29:08.833 --> 29:10.784

Stop saying it's okay.

I don't need you to make
me feel better about this.

29:17.825 --> 29:20.120
Look, I know that you raised
your daughter a certain way,

29:20.146 --> 29:21.215
and that worked for you, but...

29:21.239 --> 29:22.199

you paid to lie for you.

36:03.457 --> 36:05.595
We can work through this.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.752
I slept with my ex-boyfriend...

36:10.337 --> 36:12.896
While you were away.

36:13.389 --> 36:15.456
[Breathes deeply]

36:15.481 --> 36:17.505
W-why would you do that?

36:17.530 --> 36:19.682
I don't know.

36:19.707 --> 36:21.783
Are you getting back together with him?

36:21.808 --> 36:23.160
No. I'm not.

36:23.185 --> 36:25.046
I'm <i> so</i> sorry.

36:25.071 --> 36:26.822
I don't understand.

36:26.847 --> 36:28.047
I don't understand, either.

36:28.072 --> 36:30.884
I mean, I've never done
anything like this before,

36:30.909 --> 36:32.135
and you're such a great man.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.761
No... No.

36:35.918 --> 36:37.548
Don't do that.

36:40.685 --> 36:42.732
Goodbye, April.

36:50.018 --> 36:52.170
[Doorbell rings]

36:54.692 --> 36:56.899
Why are you ignoring my calls?

36:56.953 --> 36:58.520
I'm just leaving for work...

36:58.647 --> 36:59.780
What happened?

36:59.805 --> 37:01.473
You were open, we were talking,

37:01.498 --> 37:03.755
and then you slammed the
door shut with no explanation.

37:03.780 --> 37:05.256
What changed?

37:05.786 --> 37:07.312
Nothing's changed.

37:07.380 --> 37:09.372
I just had more time to think about it,

37:09.397 --> 37:10.396
and the more I did,

37:10.421 --> 37:12.780
the more I realized how
complicated it would be.

37:12.805 --> 37:15.440
Which is why I was
suggesting a conversation.

37:15.465 --> 37:17.599
Yes, but there's no point
in having a conversation

37:17.624 --> 37:20.184
if we aren't all going to
be honest with each other.

37:20.209 --> 37:23.240
I saw you yesterday with
a very good-looking man

37:23.265 --> 37:24.832
who was...

37:25.214 --> 37:26.231
Holding you.

37:26.508 --> 37:28.130

37:28.155 --> 37:29.013

37:29.038 --> 37:31.247
Oh, my God. You think I'm having an affair.

37:31.272 --> 37:32.973
It's none of my business.

37:32.998 --> 37:34.482
His name's Greg.

37:34.671 --> 37:36.255
He's a friend.

37:36.325 --> 37:37.959
It seemed like more.

37:38.296 --> 37:40.180
I really don't want to
get involved, Vivian.

37:40.205 --> 37:41.522
It's your life.

37:41.547 --> 37:46.018
It was an intense conversation
with an old, dear friend.

37:46.043 --> 37:47.580
And you're right... Alec has no idea

37:47.605 --> 37:49.173
that I was with Greg yesterday.

37:49.198 --> 37:50.849
[Inhales deeply]

37:50.874 --> 37:52.635
Because if I told him that I saw him,

37:52.659 --> 37:55.876
I'd have to tell him <i>why</i> I saw him.
