Today's the day.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.278
We are doing it.

01:10.361 --> 01:14.032
I got Platinum passes for Six Flags.

01:14.115 --> 01:18.912
No, they still got my picture up
from when I pretended to be a war hero.

01:18.995 --> 01:23.166
I see. And may I ask
why you're eating noodles with tongs?

01:23.249 --> 01:25.752
More noods per scoop, brah.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.048
You're having
a complete nervous breakdown.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.176
It's not complete
until I stop wearing pants.

01:35.470 --> 01:36.387
Uh-oh.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.431
What do bike shorts mean?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.391
Perhaps it's time we called Grace.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.102
No, I can't.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.187
I've got to get used to being on my own,

01:44.270 --> 01:46.606
and Grace has got to get used
to being married.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.027
We said we weren't gonna call each other
about every little thing.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.822
Well, then, you need
to snap yourself out of this.

01:53.905 --> 01:57.867
Did you read that book I gave you,
<i>You Need to Snap Yourself Out of This?</i>

01:57.951 --> 02:03.248
Oh, yeah, that bullshit about how the way
you live can affect your mental health?

02:03.331 --> 02:05.834
Well, it really helped me
when I was a person of interest

02:05.917 --> 02:07.335
in my husband's death.

Where is the book?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.552
I think we both know I lost it.

Hi, sailor.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.675
Come here often?

02:55.758 --> 02:57.427
Only when I'm not avoiding my wife.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.806
Why don't I take the day off?

03:01.890 --> 03:04.809
We'll go see Jurassic Park.
I can have the plane ready in an hour.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.228
Why would we fly somewhere
to watch a movie?

03:07.645 --> 03:08.605
Movie?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.565
You know, honestly, I was...

03:10.982 --> 03:14.110
I was kind of looking forward
to settling into a routine

03:14.194 --> 03:18.615
after Vegas and Bora Bora
and that weird half-day in Boise.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.492
I had to take you
to my favorite Ruth's Chris.

03:21.826 --> 03:23.244
You should go to work.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.457
-But I... I will take a hug.

[Nick] Mmm. [grunts]

-Mmm.
-[Grace chuckles]

03:36.341 --> 03:37.842
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's good.
-Mmm.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.678
Someone's a little clingy this morning.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.889
-Well, can you blame me?
-[chuckles]

03:42.972 --> 03:47.018
Here's an exciting thought.
How about a night at home? I'll cook.

03:47.101 --> 03:50.355
True story, I've never once had
a home-cooked meal.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.774
And I'll do you one better.
We'll invite Keith.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.817
-Keith who?
-Skolka.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.111
-Keith Skolka?
-Your son.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.155
Oh, God. Keith?

03:59.656 --> 04:02.325
Well, you know my daughters.
I don't know your son at all.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.911
Funny thing is,
I don't even really know him very well.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.372
But from what I hear
around the office, he's...

04:07.455 --> 04:09.999
You know, he's what you'd call
a "small doses" guy.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.167
Well, it's happening.

04:11.751 --> 04:14.963
You've seen my family
in all its dysfunctional glory.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.049
-Now it's your turn.
-How can I argue with that?

04:18.716 --> 04:19.717
Should we say tomorrow?

04:20.677 --> 04:25.139
Fine. I'll figure out
where his desk is and tell him.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.224
Good boy.

04:26.516 --> 04:27.684
[knocking]

04:28.685 --> 04:31.062
Nick, we need to leave five minutes ago

04:31.145 --> 04:33.564
if we're gonna make this meeting
with Matsuhashi.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.943
Hi, Grace. Congratulations, by the way.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.654
Thank you, Miriam.
What happened to your arm?

04:39.737 --> 04:41.698
Oh, nothing too exciting.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.200
I hurt it playing with Pete Sampras.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.868
You play tennis with Pete Sampras?

04:46.452 --> 04:47.370
No.

04:47.453 --> 04:50.623
Come on. Move it or lose it, buster.
You've got a schedule to keep.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.916
What would he do without you?

04:52.500 --> 04:55.044
Go to prison for many, many years.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.672
I have done some stuff. Shall we?

04:57.755 --> 04:59.382
Yeah. I'll call us a cab.

04:59.966 --> 05:01.801
[both laugh]

05:01.884 --> 05:02.969
Can you imagine?

05:03.052 --> 05:05.263
No. The helicopter's waiting on the roof.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.432
-Come on, let's go. Bye, Grace.
-Bye.

05:07.515 --> 05:08.933
[Miriam laughs] A cab.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.812
Oh. [exhales]

05:16.065 --> 05:19.152
See, I think if we amortize
our four-point-seven...

05:19.235 --> 05:21.112
Let's just call it a five.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.239
If we amortize that surplus
from last quarter

05:23.323 --> 05:26.284
to cover the current gaps in production,
well, I just...

05:26.367 --> 05:28.369
I think we're gonna see
some pretty spectacular

05:28.453 --> 05:30.246
end-of-the-year fiscal projections.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.247
I mean, I'm...

05:31.539 --> 05:33.207
-I'm talking...
-[keyboard clacking]

05:33.291 --> 05:36.294
At best, mind you. I mean, at best a...

05:37.003 --> 05:41.090
point-zero-eight-four percent bump
in variable revenue stream facilitation.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.010
Boom. [chuckles]
How do you like them bananas?

05:45.219 --> 05:46.262
Brianna?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.181
-Brianna!
-[gasps]

05:50.683 --> 05:54.145
Wow. Barry, you just put me
right the fuck out.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.398
-Surprise, Erin and Liz are here!
-Hey.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.818
And you just showed up without calling,
so 1993.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.654
Sorry, I wanted to call,
but Liz said there was no time.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.742
Oh, no, Erin, did you decide not to have
the baby, and I'm free from this?

06:07.825 --> 06:10.244
Oh, I decided not to have the baby,

06:10.328 --> 06:13.081
but you're not free from this
because now Liz is.

06:13.414 --> 06:14.415
Wait, what?

06:14.499 --> 06:17.794
So this one decided to choose
smoking cigarettes over carrying a baby,

06:17.877 --> 06:19.087
so now it's me.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.255
And I am ovulating
like a Civil War cannon.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.341
Well, let's get you pregnant,
General Grant.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.426
Okay. And that's my cue.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.178
Okay, um...

06:27.261 --> 06:30.723
So tomorrow, at the Margera Hotel,
we booked two rooms.

06:30.807 --> 06:32.225
Check-in is at 3:00.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.769
And we will have a fruit plate
and some trail mix waiting.

06:34.852 --> 06:37.855
-Oh.
-And then you'll, well, you know...

06:37.939 --> 06:39.065
[chuckles]

06:39.190 --> 06:40.608
-Masturbate into a bowl.
-Yeah.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.735
-It's a yogurt dish.
-Right, right.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.030
And then our friend Jenny
will take your deposit

06:46.114 --> 06:47.949
and deliver it to us in our room.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.659
[Barry chuckles]

06:50.076 --> 06:50.910
Guys.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.412
Hi.

06:52.829 --> 06:56.416
I couldn't help but listen in horror.
Who is Jenny and why?

06:56.499 --> 06:59.502
-Uh, she's our middleman-slash-runner.
-Yeah, no one wants to see Barry

06:59.585 --> 07:00.962
-all flushed and sweaty.
-Mm-mm.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.256
Uh, you mean dewy and triumphant.

07:03.339 --> 07:04.966
[Liz and Erin chuckle slightly]

07:06.259 --> 07:07.385
Jenny is straight?

07:07.468 --> 07:10.388
-She is, despite our best efforts.
-[Erin chuckles]

07:10.471 --> 07:12.890
And since you didn't want to do it...

07:12.974 --> 07:13.891
Yeah.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.563
She wears a lot of Lululemon or...

07:18.646 --> 07:20.106
-She looks great in Lululemon.
-Mmm.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.774
I'm your runner, ladies.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.028
Hey.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.030
[birds chirping]

07:32.243 --> 07:34.328
Sol, are you quite ready?

07:34.412 --> 07:35.538
[Sol] Coming!

07:36.581 --> 07:40.334
The first challenge in researching
what to do for our honeymoon

07:40.418 --> 07:43.838
was narrowing it down
into four categories:

07:44.714 --> 07:45.923
Getting away from it all,

07:46.299 --> 07:47.592
learning adventure,

07:48.342 --> 07:52.221
feeling good because we're doing good,
and rumpus, general.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.559
-Robert, where are your materials?
-I don't need materials.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.061
I have researched exhaustively

07:59.479 --> 08:03.065
and am prepared to deliver
my opening remarks.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.400
Shall we begin?

08:04.484 --> 08:05.610
Okay.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.905
-Boat.
-Excuse me?

08:08.988 --> 08:11.199
Boat. Bobby wants a boat trip.

08:12.241 --> 08:16.746
Yes, well, I know you fancy yourself
a man of the sea...

08:16.829 --> 08:17.914
Thank you.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.459
But I've got a few things in these binders
that you're going to want to explore.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.710
What about Gettysburg?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.420
Perfect! We'll sail there.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.589
Think about it, Sol. We can go anywhere.

08:27.048 --> 08:31.135
Sail through the Panama Canal if we want.
Just you, me, and the deep blue sea.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.722
I don't know.
I think it's asking for trouble.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.349
How is it asking for trouble?

08:36.807 --> 08:39.852
What about your health?
Your heart attack was only four years ago.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.979
Please, I'm as healthy as a boat.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.315
Why are you so against this?

08:44.398 --> 08:49.904
Because the ocean
is no place for a person.

08:49.987 --> 08:52.823
What if you suddenly need
to get out of the boat?

08:52.907 --> 08:55.326
And how do they stay afloat, the boats?

08:55.409 --> 08:57.703
Wait. Sometimes they don't.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.541
But that's just a myth
propagated by the airline industry.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.627
Sol, what is going on with you?

09:05.586 --> 09:08.965
I can't swim, okay?
So we can't go on a boat trip,

09:09.048 --> 09:12.343
because if I fall off,
I'm sinking into a watery grave.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.845
Oh, Sol, honey,

09:14.929 --> 09:19.809
if you find yourself having to swim
on a sailing trip, you're already dead.

09:23.771 --> 09:28.192

09:44.542 --> 09:46.168
Frankie, meet Dana.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.129
Dana, meet Frankie,

09:48.212 --> 09:50.423
a shell of her former self.

09:50.506 --> 09:53.426
Oh, good. I was hoping
to meet new people today.

09:53.968 --> 09:58.472
Come in. I was just about to watch
my third-favorite Shaq movie.

09:59.015 --> 10:01.017
I hired Dana for the day.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.020
She's here to whip
your sorry ass into shape.

10:04.103 --> 10:06.355
Okay, you can stop helping now,
Joan-Margaret.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.650
Frankie, I want to help you
get your house in order.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.571
I mean, clean house, healthy mind.
Will you let me help you?

10:13.654 --> 10:16.449
It may not look like it
to the untrained eye,

10:16.532 --> 10:21.120
but I have a very carefully curated system
going on here.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.497
Okay. So, can you tell me
what your credit card is doing

10:23.581 --> 10:25.708
stuck to your back with a piece of gum?

10:25.791 --> 10:28.002
That's where I keep my credit card.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.463
But I will thank you for finding my gum.

10:31.672 --> 10:35.676
Frankie, be a good girl, won't you?
I paid good money for today.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.139
Oh, about that.
Uh, your check bounced, so if we could--

10:40.222 --> 10:41.223
Bye, girls!

10:46.228 --> 10:48.230
Look, I know you're having
a hard time right now.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.150
And I totally understand
your resistance to this process.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.777
I've seen it a million times.

10:52.860 --> 10:56.530
But I promise you that
by the end of the day, you'll feel better.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.115
All right.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.535
The whole place, I guess,
needs to be vacuumed.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.163
So your first job will be
to find the vacuum.

11:04.497 --> 11:08.042
I'll be right here if you need me.
Just tell me if the TV's too loud.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.170
Frankie, I am not a maid,
and I am not your mother.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.839
And I have already been paid, sort of.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.551
You're doing this with me,
and it's going to hurt.

11:18.135 --> 11:21.722
Now, what in God's name are these?

11:22.056 --> 11:23.432
Because I love them.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.478
-Really?
-No, they're horrible.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.647
If I had my gun, I'd shoot them.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.191
[scoffs]

11:36.821 --> 11:37.988
[knocking on door]

11:38.114 --> 11:40.449
Oh, hey, Grace, don't mind me.
I'm just in and out.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.326
Oh, hey, you.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.995
I-I just had to grab this file
I need for tomorrow.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.623
I'm so sorry,
I keep barging in on you like this.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.875
No problem.
I'm used to being barged in on.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.712
Not used to the apology.
That's refreshing.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.214
-[chuckles]
-Boundaries, right?

11:55.297 --> 11:58.426
Oh, yes. Boundaries,
they're, like, my whole thing.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.177
Well, boundaries and fen-phen.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.721
God bless you.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.433
I had a roommate who once used
my underpants as a napkin.

12:05.516 --> 12:07.351
So, this is nice.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.978
Come and have a glass of wine with me.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.106
Oh, I'd love to, but I can see
you're getting ready to eat dinner.

12:12.189 --> 12:14.358
-I don't want to intrude.
-Nonsense. Sit.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.485
[sighs] Okay.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.070
[Grace chuckles]

12:18.529 --> 12:19.363
Thanks.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.284
I've always liked you, Miriam.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.327
I'd... I'd like to...

12:25.745 --> 12:27.288
I'd like to get to know you better.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.749
Well, very few people know me, Grace.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.375
I love that.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.504
So give me a... give me a taste.
Are you seeing anyone?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.047
Oh, no, no.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.050
Boyfriends have an annoying habit
of becoming husbands,

12:40.134 --> 12:42.845
and I'm not going down that road again
anytime soon.

12:42.928 --> 12:43.929
And kids?

12:44.013 --> 12:45.556
Just my son.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.433
-[knocking on door]
-Oh.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.393
I want to know more. Hold that thought.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.854
Keith, welcome.
I'm so glad we can do this.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.440
Me too. I brought bread. Hey, Mom.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.276
Keith, I don't even like my own kids
to call me "Mom."

12:57.359 --> 12:58.861
Hello, sweetheart.

13:03.783 --> 13:04.784
[Nick] Hey, Miriam...

13:04.867 --> 13:06.494
and Keith are here together!

13:08.078 --> 13:09.413
Nick!

13:14.668 --> 13:15.920
Oh. Excuse me.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.925
-Hey, so this is super weird.
-Did you guys know it was Comic-Con?

13:21.008 --> 13:25.095
No, but that explains the drunk Spider-Man
passed out on our lawn this morning.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.264
A lot of lonely boys in latex.

13:27.348 --> 13:31.143
Most of these costumes are probably
actually a spandex-cotton blend.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.521
You know, they wish they had latex.
[chuckles]

13:35.314 --> 13:36.982
To our rooms! [chuckles]

13:37.525 --> 13:38.734
Good luck, Barry.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.237
-Thanks again, Brianna.
-Yeah, no sweat.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.824
Shuffling around a glass bowl of spunk
amidst a sea of doughy Captain Americas

13:44.907 --> 13:47.993
is definitely not an actual,
real nightmare I've had.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.704
Milady.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.083
-What?
-Wait, wait, wait.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.794
Did new-Mom not know
that old-Mom is my mom?

13:56.877 --> 13:58.838
No, she definitely did not.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.966
Oh, new-Mom's not gonna like this.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.052
Can we pump the brakes
on the "new-Mom" talk?

14:05.135 --> 14:07.596
Thank you, Keith.
I see you've brought bread.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.848
It's for dinner.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.142
Why am I not surprised
that you didn't tell her?

14:12.226 --> 14:13.310
What's that supposed to mean?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.271
I think it's supposed to mean
you got a new--

14:15.354 --> 14:16.605
Once again, thank you, Keith.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.817
I'm so sorry, Grace. I assumed you knew.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.235
No reason to be sorry.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.321
In fact, why don't you join us for dinner?

14:25.239 --> 14:26.282
I made a roast.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.077
Oh, Grace, that's so weird
of you to offer,

14:30.160 --> 14:31.996
but you know what,
I really should be going.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.163
I insist.

14:33.789 --> 14:37.418
I wanted to have a lovely evening
getting to know my husband's family,

14:37.501 --> 14:39.378
and here you all are.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.213
Honey, are you sure you wouldn't--?

14:41.297 --> 14:43.007
I made a roast!

14:44.258 --> 14:45.968
[vacuum whirring]

14:47.678 --> 14:49.263
Hey, Frankie.

14:49.930 --> 14:50.890
[vacuum turns off]

14:50.973 --> 14:52.725
I need you to give me three good reasons

14:52.808 --> 14:56.979
why we should keep this Happy Meals prize
from 1988.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.564
It's a collector's item.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.524
He swivels.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.193
And we almost named Coyote "Hamburglar"

15:03.277 --> 15:07.364
but ultimately decided that was
a ridiculous name for a child.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.324
[chuckles]

15:08.407 --> 15:12.411
Okay, but-but-but where would be
a good place for it?

15:13.579 --> 15:14.705
The floor?

15:15.372 --> 15:17.333
-But I know that's not right.
-Mmm.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.919
Hey, how about this?

15:22.671 --> 15:23.631
[exhales]

15:23.714 --> 15:24.798
[clicks tongue]

15:26.008 --> 15:29.845
So, what about these <i>Welding Woman</i>
magazines from the 1970s on?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.430
Do we need all of these?

15:31.513 --> 15:32.681
Y-Yes.

15:33.140 --> 15:34.600
Do you weld?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.435
Not as such, no.

15:36.518 --> 15:38.938
-So these are crazy, right?
-[exhales]

15:39.021 --> 15:40.314
I suppose.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.650
[necklaces clattering]

15:42.733 --> 15:44.360
Would you stop struggling?

15:44.818 --> 15:48.280
Good Lord,
how many necklaces do you need?

15:48.364 --> 15:50.157
Some of these are belts.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.244
And who is this, please?

15:56.038 --> 15:57.289
Nobody.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.087
-Hey.
-[Dana] Good job!

16:03.170 --> 16:05.381
Done early with plenty of time to spare.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.757
[Frankie] And spare we shall.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.593
I'm rolling a particularly hearty joint.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.512
-Care for a sip?
-[Dana] No, thanks.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.139
But I, uh... I did see
a freezer full of vodka,

16:14.223 --> 16:16.725
and I am a sucker for a dry martini.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.980
And I'm a sucker for a gal
who's a sucker for a dry martini.

16:21.397 --> 16:22.690
Hmm.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.902
Under. Reach. Good.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.404
Reach. Big elbows.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.614
Reach. Scoop. Great.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.075
Scoop. Reach as far as you can reach...

16:33.158 --> 16:34.660
I was snack mom today.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.455
-My compliments. I love string cheese.
-Yeah, so does my Jason.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.374
-He's the one in the red trunks.
-Mmm.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.293
Ugh, he was so nervous,
I had to bribe him to come today.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.046
Hmm. You should've seen mine this morning.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.798
Yeah? Which one's yours?

16:47.881 --> 16:50.551
-[Kyle] Reach.
-The seven-foot-tall 80-year-old man.

16:50.634 --> 16:52.886
Reach. Reach.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.596
Yeah. Over.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.391
Reach. Reach.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.143
Point your toes.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.353
Ballerina kicks.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.772
Like a ballerina.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.900
Ballerina kicks, everyone.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.235
[grunts loudly]

17:08.360 --> 17:09.528
Make bubbles.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.949
[Sol grunting]

17:16.535 --> 17:17.536
[grunts continue]

17:17.995 --> 17:20.539
[Kyle] Keep kicking.
You're falling behind.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.666
I told you, Kyle,

17:22.750 --> 17:26.962
I only respond to positive reinforcement,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.715
and if you were a good instructor,
you'd know that education

17:29.798 --> 17:34.553
is not monolithic
and that every child learns differently!

17:37.181 --> 17:38.432
Come on, let's go!

17:40.267 --> 17:41.727
I know you can do it.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.025
I'm doing it!

17:49.026 --> 17:50.194
I'm doing it!

17:52.404 --> 17:53.572
Are you walking, sir?

17:55.949 --> 17:56.825
Yes.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
[exhales]

18:00.704 --> 18:03.457
Brianna! I told you
we should have brought a go-bag.

18:03.540 --> 18:07.294
All the lotions are scented.
It's like masturbating at a Sephora.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.129
I'm not listening.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.632
[woman on TV] <i>And... And what's nice</i>
<i>about this product is...</i>

18:11.715 --> 18:13.592
[TV chatter continues indistinctly]

18:15.803 --> 18:16.720
Hmm.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.643
Hey, did you remember
to bring your soft clothes?

18:22.726 --> 18:23.977
I'm gonna want to cuddle after.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.438
I think we should see other people.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.983
[door opens in adjacent room]

18:30.067 --> 18:31.735
[man 1] I'm so tired of this conversation.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.696
Hulk is the most powerful mutant
in the Marvel Universe.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.073
Jesus Christ.

18:36.156 --> 18:38.367
[man 2] You betray yourself, sir. Hulk?

18:38.450 --> 18:39.743
Strongest, sure.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.204
-But can he bend time? No.
-[scoffs]

18:42.287 --> 18:44.498
-Who can? Cable.
-Wha...?

18:44.581 --> 18:47.793
[man 3] You're both tourists.
It begins and ends with Jean Grey.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.213
It's Franklin Richards! Franklin Richards!

18:51.296 --> 18:53.173
Jesus dang Christ!

18:53.257 --> 18:56.760
[scoffs] Incredible Hulk?
He isn't even an Omega-Level mutant.

18:56.844 --> 19:01.181
Franklin Richards can create
whole universes out of dang nothing!

19:01.265 --> 19:03.517
So y'all pretenders needs to shut it

19:03.600 --> 19:06.145
'cause some of us
are trying to masturbate in here!

19:06.228 --> 19:07.312
[man] Yeah!

19:07.938 --> 19:09.690
[smooth jazz playing]

19:21.493 --> 19:23.162
-Is everyone enjoying the roast?
-Mmm.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.080
-Delicious.
-Mmm, roast.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.338
Look, our... our marriage
basically meant nothing.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.133
-Less than nothing.
-For sure. Not a happy home.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.927
We were completely wrong for each other.

19:39.011 --> 19:41.847
But you two are such...
great communicators.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.766
Though neither of you
told me you were married.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.269
Would you buy
"I was getting around to it"?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.813
-Pass the peas?
-How long were you married?

19:49.897 --> 19:51.398
Okay, cards on the table...

19:52.608 --> 19:53.567
I totally forget.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.569
Ditto. I mean, long enough
for this to happen.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.653
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey-o.

19:56.737 --> 20:01.700
But you guys work so well together.
So why didn't you work so well together?

20:01.783 --> 20:04.536
Well, things tend to fall apart
when you screw the help.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.871
What? Wait...

20:06.872 --> 20:09.166
Nick, my God! Are you kidding me?

20:09.249 --> 20:11.543
Oh, no. No, that was my bad.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.503
Giacomo...

20:13.921 --> 20:15.297
He took me to soccer a bunch.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.965
Giacomo was actually a great guy.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.884
Did Giacomo know
you were married to Miriam?

20:18.967 --> 20:21.011
That's a Miriam question. Keith, the peas?

20:21.094 --> 20:23.680
[Miriam] Okay, well, I think you two
have got a lot of screaming to do.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.975
-So, Keith, let's go.
-I'm still workin' on this roast.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.102
-Move your ass!
-Get the hell out of here!

20:31.104 --> 20:32.397
[Keith] Thanks for dinner.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.857
Bye.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.442
[exhales]

20:36.318 --> 20:37.653
Well, you're fucked.

20:40.572 --> 20:41.865
[exhales]

20:43.533 --> 20:45.702
[heavy breaths]

20:45.786 --> 20:46.870
Yeah.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.623
[exhales]

20:53.210 --> 20:54.920
It's bad if I throw up in it, right?

20:55.295 --> 20:56.880
Just go. [pants]

20:56.964 --> 20:57.965
Okay.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.217
-Careful.
-Okay, okay.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.511
I'm going.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.639
-It's actually really authentic. We--
-[gasps]

21:10.686 --> 21:12.437
Of course it's a pair of elves.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
-[owl hooting]
-[crickets chirping]

21:14.898 --> 21:17.609
-I was proud of you today.
-You were?

21:17.693 --> 21:18.902
Of course.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.238
And if this really is
something you cannot do,

21:21.321 --> 21:24.283
then we just won't go
on a boat trip. I'll get over it.

21:24.866 --> 21:25.951
[chuckles]

21:29.496 --> 21:30.956
You're a good husband.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.458
[chuckles]

21:35.752 --> 21:38.338
So... honeymoon ideas?

21:38.839 --> 21:40.882
How a-boat a European trip?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.510
Robert, you just said "how a-boat."

21:44.428 --> 21:46.596
What is it with you and sailing?

21:47.222 --> 21:51.393
I don't know, I guess it all started
when I saw Grace Kelly and Bing Crosby

21:51.476 --> 21:54.563
on that sailing boat in <i>High Society.</i>
Remember?

21:55.480 --> 21:58.150
It all seemed so glamorous and far away.

21:58.233 --> 22:01.695
And I wanted to be
a part of that world so badly.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.947
Is that why you joined the Navy?

22:04.031 --> 22:08.035
Yes. Being a weatherographer
on the USS <i>Pocono</i>

22:08.118 --> 22:09.911
is about as close as I ever got.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.664
But I still dream about that sailboat.

22:17.252 --> 22:20.088
If it means this much to you,
I'm going to do it.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.968
I'm going to learn to swim.
I'm going to beat this thing.

22:25.052 --> 22:27.888
If you can learn to swim,
I promise you this:

22:28.347 --> 22:31.641
I will stop eating bacon past 10:00 p.m.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.393
Really?

22:33.477 --> 22:35.270
11:00 p.m., yep.

22:37.356 --> 22:40.359
And that's why I'm not welcome back
at Benihana.

22:40.442 --> 22:42.194
[both laugh]

22:42.819 --> 22:46.823
Oh, God, I wish I was
a little more like you.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.951
-You mean fascinated by knives?
-[chuckles]

22:51.453 --> 22:52.871
-Oh.
-I think it's cashed.

22:52.954 --> 22:54.373
[chuckles]

22:54.748 --> 22:57.751
You know what?
This whole day's been about me.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.587
I feel like I don't know
anything about you.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.341
You're obviously career-oriented.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.260
What else? Kids? A gay husband?
Tell me everything.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.304
Oh, Frankie, I am not in the habit

23:09.388 --> 23:12.599
of talking about my personal life
or feelings.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.268
Not yet. Wait till I open you up.

23:16.436 --> 23:19.231
And that sounded
exactly the way I wanted it to.

23:19.314 --> 23:20.607
[both laugh]

23:21.066 --> 23:22.275
What do you want to know?

23:22.651 --> 23:24.486
Okay, we'll start off easy.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.447
-Where are you from?
-Denver.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.157
-Go, Nuggets.
-Mm-hmm.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.828
Are you estranged
from any immediate family members?

23:32.911 --> 23:33.870
[both laugh]

23:33.954 --> 23:37.791
I thought you said
we were gonna start off easy.

23:37.874 --> 23:38.875
Well, we did.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.586
-There was all that great Denver stuff.
-[laughs]

23:42.546 --> 23:43.839
Okay.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.507
Well, I...

23:46.466 --> 23:48.468
I'm kind of on the outs
with my oldest daughter.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.679
We're not speaking.

23:50.762 --> 23:54.099
And that's kind of my area of expertise.

23:54.182 --> 23:58.728
This chick I know, Grace, I basically
taught her how to be a mom, so...

23:59.020 --> 24:00.147
[sighs]

24:00.856 --> 24:02.732
Okay, fine. Here it goes.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.735
[exhales] So, Katie and I--

24:05.819 --> 24:07.195
[alarm ringing]

24:07.279 --> 24:11.199
Oh, look at that. Our time's up.
That happened fast.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.035
What are you talking about?
We're just getting started.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.705
No, Joan-Margaret only hired me
for eight hours.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.540
I really need to get going.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.626
Oh, I... I guess I just thought...

24:21.710 --> 24:24.629
Frankie, the place looks great.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.631
Look at all we got done in just one day.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.716
So now we party.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.553
No, now I go home and you party.

24:31.928 --> 24:34.806
But I don't know
where any of my things are.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.226
Well, I don't know about you,
but I actually had fun today.

24:38.685 --> 24:39.769
Me, too.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.274
Oh, what the hell. I don't normally
do this with clients, but...

24:44.357 --> 24:45.317
Yes?

24:45.775 --> 24:48.111
Would you mind leaving me
a good review on Yelp?

24:49.070 --> 24:51.573
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.949
I mean, it'll be easy

24:53.033 --> 24:55.452
-since you found my phone in the fridge.
-[chuckles]

24:58.747 --> 25:01.541
It was good meeting you,
Frankie Steinberg.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.878
See ya.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.226
Well, now Keith can't say
I never had dinner with him.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.312
What the hell were you thinking?

25:22.395 --> 25:23.897
Okay. I wasn't thinking.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.107
She's been my business partner
for so long,

25:26.191 --> 25:29.986
I-I'd truly, truly forgotten
we were ever married.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.489
Oh, bullshit. Bullshit.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.408
You can keep saying bullshit,
but it doesn't make it bullshit.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.826
You lied to me.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.828
Okay, fine. You...

25:39.746 --> 25:41.248
You know why I didn't tell you?

25:41.331 --> 25:44.334
Yeah, 'cause you're a coward, and you
didn't want to have to deal with it.

25:44.417 --> 25:45.418
Well, obviously that.

25:45.502 --> 25:49.422
But also, I was worried that you'd
make me fire her. And I need her.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.299
Why would I make you fire her?

25:51.383 --> 25:54.219
-Well, you know, old wife, new wife...
-[scoffs]

25:54.302 --> 25:58.181
I do understand the concept
of a professional relationship.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.349
Of course you do.

25:59.432 --> 26:01.226
Well, then next time,
don't underestimate me

26:01.309 --> 26:03.562
and assume you know
how I'm gonna react.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.274
I won't. I promise.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.735
-Will you do the same thing for me?
-Of course!

26:14.614 --> 26:15.657
Well, I'm...

26:16.157 --> 26:18.910
I'm waiting for you
to not underestimate me about a thing.

26:18.994 --> 26:20.120
A thing.

26:20.203 --> 26:21.997
A couch thing. And...

26:22.956 --> 26:24.874
not being able to get off it.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.836
You noticed?

26:27.919 --> 26:31.214
Yes. I was a person in the room
with all my faculties.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.801
Okay, you know something?
This couch is a death trap, and I hate it.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.221
Okay. Fuck this couch
and the sultan who gave it to me.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.307
-Fuck that couch!
-[laughs]

26:40.849 --> 26:46.605
The only thing in this house
that means anything to me at all is you.

26:48.523 --> 26:49.566
And my ties.

-I really want to make us work.
-Me, too.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.292
So, from now on,

27:08.335 --> 27:10.170
let's tell each other everything.

Total honesty.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.148
[Brianna] Okay, I have some good news
and bad news.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.693
Bad news first, please.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.278
[Brianna] I bumped into some elves,

27:35.362 --> 27:37.322
and I spilled all of your semen
on the ground.

27:37.405 --> 27:41.951
Brianna, you know how hard it is to get
two in a row out of me on a good night.

27:42.035 --> 27:43.286
Did you do this on purpose?

27:43.370 --> 27:44.996
[Brianna] Of course not.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.583
Can you blame me for asking? I mean,
you've never been on board with this.

27:48.667 --> 27:52.045
If I didn't want you to do this,
would I have done this?

27:54.297 --> 27:55.423
Get the bowl.

27:56.091 --> 27:58.385
I love you,
and I know that you can do this.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.762
You're better
than all those stupid eight-year-olds

28:00.845 --> 28:03.515
with their malleable minds
and their supple joints.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.892
You have something they don't have, Sol.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.228
Bigger hands. Use them!

28:11.231 --> 28:12.440
I can do this.

28:12.524 --> 28:17.112
Yes, you can. And I'll be walking
right beside you every stroke of the way.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.655
Godspeed, my love.
