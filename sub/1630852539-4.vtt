not attracted to me.

suck at eating pussy.

You're not,
you're not you.

51:49.898 --> 51:52.442

and I--

52:45.745 --> 52:47.497
Hoo!

52:47.581 --> 52:50.542
Picked up a real
grade-A piece of ass...

52:51.459 --> 52:54.629
huge tits,
shaved pussy...

52:54.713 --> 52:57.382
and I fucked the shit
outta her in my truck...

52:57.465 --> 53:01.428
you wouldn't be
one-tenth as appalled
as you are right now.

53:01.511 --> 53:05.265
You wouldn't be standin'
here saying, "Dad, what
are you talkin' about?"

53:05.348 --> 53:09.060
You'd be like,
"Dad, don't say that
in front of Mom."

53:09.144 --> 53:12.939
Fuck you... Fuck you.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.317

sexist, chaser, pig,

53:41.509 --> 53:43.970

53:45.013 --> 53:46.890
Living a double life?

53:49.768 --> 53:51.770
Not my biggest regret.

53:56.107 --> 53:57.442
You are.

53:59.527 --> 54:02.238
But let's be honest,
we all live double lives.

54:02.322 --> 54:05.075
Don't give me
that look, Marsha.

54:05.158 --> 54:07.410

full of love letters

54:07.494 --> 54:09.621

used to write you.

54:09.704 --> 54:12.374

you were loved by somebody
other than just me.

54:20.423 --> 54:23.718

54:53.289 --> 54:55.792

I was kind of uptight

55:16.563 --> 55:19.566

and a fuckin' fox.

55:19.649 --> 55:23.319

55:29.868 --> 55:32.287

life's a secret.

55:33.079 --> 55:35.290
A mystery.

55:35.373 --> 55:37.876
Who knows about you?

55:40.503 --> 55:42.547
I have lived with you.

55:47.052 --> 55:48.762
I have raised you.

55:48.845 --> 55:51.056
I am your father.

55:52.057 --> 55:55.268
I know nothing about you.

55:55.351 --> 55:59.564
That's not true.
I know that you're angry.

55:59.647 --> 56:02.484
I'm so sorry
I fucked you up
with my double life.

56:02.567 --> 56:04.319
(laughs)

56:09.741 --> 56:14.370
Okay, maybe, I took
mine to the extreme,
I'll admit that, but...

56:14.454 --> 56:15.997
I have a problem.

56:17.332 --> 56:20.585
But the reason I have
a problem is this family.

56:20.668 --> 56:22.462
That's why.

56:22.545 --> 56:25.632
I'm not allowed to form
an emotional connection.

56:28.301 --> 56:30.345
And I'm an emotional guy.

56:31.971 --> 56:34.557
You fuckers backed me
into a corner.

56:37.060 --> 56:38.686

56:40.730 --> 56:42.690
I think you've set me free.

56:44.442 --> 56:45.610
So...

56:47.028 --> 56:48.404
this is farewell.

56:49.823 --> 56:52.158
I left you with a little...

56:52.242 --> 56:56.496
memory of me here
on the floor of the foyer.
You...

56:56.579 --> 57:01.292
