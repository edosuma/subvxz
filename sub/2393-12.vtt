ARE YOU KEEPING
A DEAD RAT?
I FOUND IT ON THE BUS.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.920
YOU CHECKED OUT
THE BUS?

00:05.970 --> 00:08.564
I SHOULD'VE TAKEN OVER
THIS CASE.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.500
YOU EVER HIT THE CLUBS
IN L.A.?
I'M 18.

00:10.540 --> 00:13.509
I'M A BOUNCER.
I'LL GET YOU IN.

00:13.540 --> 00:14.370
OKAY.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.173
I THOUGHT
YOU KILLED FELIX.

00:16.210 --> 00:18.178
HOW WE GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHO DID IT?

00:18.210 --> 00:20.519
THE ONE THAT DID IT
IS WITH THE FITZPATRICKS.

00:20.550 --> 00:22.438
WHO ARE YOU?
I'M YOUR FATHER.

00:22.490 --> 00:24.287

00:27.660 --> 00:29.127
WHY DID YOU REALLY
COME BACK?

00:29.160 --> 00:30.627
MY TEAMMATE
WAS RASHARD RUCKER.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.390
RASHARD HAD A FEW BEERS.
HE SAID HE WAS OKAY TO DRIVE.

00:33.430 --> 00:36.160

IN FRONT OF THE CAR. HE HIT HIM.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.628
THE HOMELESS MAN
WAS A VICTIM.
WHAT'S THE QUESTION?

00:40.670 --> 00:45.164
THE QUESTION IS WHAT KIND OF MAN
WERE YOU PLANNING ON BEING?

00:56.650 --> 00:59.619
SO, THE MANAGER'S BOYFRIEND
JUST DUMPED HER

00:59.660 --> 01:02.083
AND SHE SAYS THIS HELPS
WITH THE STRESS.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.279
WHAT IS IT?

01:03.330 --> 01:06.094
A GERMAN CHOCOLATE

01:06.130 --> 01:08.997
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S GONNA HELP.

01:09.030 --> 01:10.361
WELL, EAT IT ANYWAY

01:10.400 --> 01:13.460
BECAUSE RASHARD RUCKER
ISN'T JUST ANY GUY.

ABOUT TO IMPLICATE

AROUND HIM,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.641
THEY MIGHT OPEN
THEIR NEWSPAPERS TOMORROW

01:28.680 --> 01:30.614
AND DECIDE
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU.

DO THE RIGHT THING.

IS SO UNDERSIZED

03:01.880 --> 03:05.646

IT'LL START
MAKING MORE SENSE SOON.

JUST A SLOW TYPIST.
