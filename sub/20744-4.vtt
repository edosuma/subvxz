WEBVTT

00:13.714 --> 00:15.082
- It's really hot in here.

00:15.082 --> 00:16.316
- I like it hot.

00:19.953 --> 00:22.923
- I have never heard
anything like that.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.592
- That was incredible.

00:25.592 --> 00:26.994
- I will remember that.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.696
- Oh, God!

00:29.696 --> 00:30.000
- You were men up there,

00:30.000 --> 00:30.998
- You were men up there,

00:30.998 --> 00:33.600
like, full-on,
powerhouse men.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.370
- Everyone in America
is gonna know your name.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.206
- I didn't come here
to try out.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.841
I came here to win.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.913
- I think you are
the next Taylor Swift.

00:50.851 --> 00:55.622
- It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.625
- Oh, my gosh.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.000
- I loved it.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.128
- I loved it.

01:01.128 --> 01:03.430
- Sorry, I've got to do this.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.981
- I don't know why it's called
"America's Got Talent,"

01:20.981 --> 01:24.651
because I think the whole world
showed up.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.587
- Ladies, this is
a one-time show.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.455
We'll never have
another chance to do this.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.000
- Make or break,
90 seconds.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.692
- Make or break,
90 seconds.

01:31.692 --> 01:32.893
- Two, European.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.027
- From Europe, Europe.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.562
- Look, this is especially
for you today.

01:35.562 --> 01:36.997
- Oh, my God.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.899
- Thank you.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.167
Oh, God.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.702
- Can I have a kiss, please?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.937
- That's maybe going
a little too far.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.938
I'll blow you one.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.473
- Thank you.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.442
- ♪ Come on, shake your body,
baby, do that Conga ♪

01:48.442 --> 01:49.843
- Howie, you excited?

01:49.843 --> 01:51.244
- Look at me.

01:51.244 --> 01:53.413
I'm thrilled to be sitting
on this side of the panel.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.983
- But I'm still sitting
next to him.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.217
- How did that work out?

01:57.217 --> 01:59.620
- Because she secretly
does love Howie.

01:59.620 --> 02:00.000
- Have you two ever
made out?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.321
- Have you two ever
made out?

02:01.321 --> 02:03.557
- No!

02:06.927 --> 02:09.830
- Lots of drama
at the judging table.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.164
It's definitely interesting.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.532
You guys ready to get to it?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.436
Let's rock.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.406
- Okay, mark it.

02:19.406 --> 02:20.841
- How long have you guys
known each other?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.342
- When I first met Abby,

02:22.342 --> 02:24.411
I thought
she was so beautiful.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.679
I was like, "Wow."

02:25.679 --> 02:27.180
- My shoelace was undone,

02:27.180 --> 02:30.000
so he went on his knees
and started tying my shoelace,

02:30.000 --> 02:30.083
so he went on his knees
and started tying my shoelace,

02:30.083 --> 02:32.719
whilst asking me
to marry him.

02:32.719 --> 02:33.887
- She was the coolest.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.090
I mean, you are still,
you are still.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.993
- We are a pretty
unusual couple, I guess,

02:39.993 --> 02:43.764
because I throw knives
on my wife.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.132
- How you guys doing?

02:45.132 --> 02:46.299
- Good.
- Hello.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.467
- What's the name
of the act?

02:47.467 --> 02:48.468
- Deadly Games.

02:48.468 --> 02:49.469
- Deadly Games.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.904
- Don't mess with us.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.740
- I saw from afar
I wasn't gonna mess with y'all.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.012
- We met almost eight years ago.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.000
I knew I had the right one,
and I could not let her go.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.816
I knew I had the right one,
and I could not let her go.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.652
Imana and I got married
a little over two years ago.

03:05.652 --> 03:06.987
- Finally.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.221
And the best thing,

03:08.221 --> 03:10.891
we have 2-year-old daughter.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.601
- We both realized we have
this passion for the danger.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.936
And we decide to create

03:22.936 --> 03:25.639
this crazy, unique
knife-throwing act.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.274
The knives we use are real.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.942
I cannot make a mistake.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.000
- Sometimes I feel the wind
from the knife

03:30.000 --> 03:31.611
- Sometimes I feel the wind
from the knife

03:31.611 --> 03:33.714
so close to my head,

03:33.714 --> 03:36.850
my heart is like, "Oh..."

03:36.850 --> 03:38.652
- Right now, we travel a lot,

03:38.652 --> 03:41.188
and we live in
a lot of small space,

03:41.188 --> 03:44.291
like trailers and caravans
in Vegas.

03:44.291 --> 03:48.161
Our lifelong dream
is to have our own show,

03:48.161 --> 03:51.531
not just for us,
but it is for our daughter.

03:51.531 --> 03:55.235
And tonight is the biggest
chance we ever had,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.003
and we are ready.

03:58.538 --> 04:00.000
Uh-huh.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.708
Uh-huh.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.043
- Wow.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.845
- Hi, welcome.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.546
And who are you, please?

04:06.546 --> 04:07.547
- My name is Alfredo.

04:07.547 --> 04:08.682
I'm 34 years old.

04:08.682 --> 04:09.683
- And you are...

04:09.683 --> 04:10.817
- Imana.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.285
And I'm 32 years old,

04:12.285 --> 04:13.920
and I'm his wife.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.256
- So how long have
you been married, you two?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.924
- We've been together
for almost eight years,

04:17.924 --> 04:20.026
but we've been married
for a little over two years.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.896
- So, from where you started
and now you're here today,

04:22.896 --> 04:25.632
has it been easy,
or have you had tough times?

04:25.632 --> 04:27.567
- It's been a very
difficult road, you know.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.970
Knife-throwing act
is one of the most old acts.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.000
A lot of people do this.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.204
A lot of people do this.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.706
You know, we try to make
something different

04:32.706 --> 04:34.107
from something really old.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.042
- When I say,
"Did things go wrong?"

04:36.042 --> 04:37.878
I think you know
what I'm referring to.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.813
- I know.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.081
I hit her twice.

04:43.650 --> 04:47.187
- Okay, so, basically,
without stating the obvious,

04:47.187 --> 04:49.189
this is really,
really dangerous.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.223
- It's dangerous.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.059
I can kill her
if I throw the knife

04:53.059 --> 04:56.563
maybe one or two millimeters
too close, hit her neck.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.000
She's the one pushing me
to the do the crazier tricks,

05:00.000 --> 05:00.834
She's the one pushing me
to the do the crazier tricks,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.135
believe me or not.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.204
- Really?
- Really?

05:04.204 --> 05:06.706
- Okay, well, look, good luck.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.208
- Thank you very much.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.150
- Whoa.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.151
Close.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.454
I can't stand it.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.000
- Good job, A!

06:00.000 --> 06:00.060
- Good job, A!

06:00.060 --> 06:01.695
Good job!

06:12.973 --> 06:15.308
- What?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.776
- I can't watch it.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.083
- Oh, my God, no,
don't do it again, stop, stop.

06:31.758 --> 06:36.329
- Oh, God, God, God, God.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.599
- How's your heart?

06:39.599 --> 06:41.768
- I don't like watching this.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.504
- That's barbaric.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.451
- Whoa.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.971
- That was a little crazy.

07:22.509 --> 07:25.045
- Mel.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.513
- That made me really nervous.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.748
Like, really, really nervous.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.000
And I was literally watching it
the whole time like this.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.217
And I was literally watching it
the whole time like this.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.519
"Ergh!"

07:32.519 --> 07:36.056
So it was very entertaining,
in a frightening way.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.857
- Thank you very much.

07:37.857 --> 07:39.359
- Howie.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.361
- Well, I got to say that we've
seen a lot of knife-throwing,

07:41.361 --> 07:45.098
but we've never seen
somebody moving so much.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.833
It's even more dangerous.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.068
You're amazing.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.272
- Heidi?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.941
- I thought it was
absolutely thrilling.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.776
Immediately,
from the very get-go.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.244
You know,
a lot of the acts that come,

07:58.244 --> 07:59.846
they kind of dance
around a little bit

07:59.846 --> 08:00.000
until they get to it.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.147
until they get to it.

08:01.147 --> 08:03.249
I mean, you took those knives,
and you just, bam, bam.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.617
You started immediately,

08:04.617 --> 08:06.753
so it was like, "Oh, my God,
it's happening already,"

08:06.753 --> 08:09.356
and it's so fast,
and it was so good.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.058
- Thank you very much for that,
thank you.

08:12.058 --> 08:13.660
- Normally the one
being thrown at

08:13.660 --> 08:15.462
is normally quite boring.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.163
But you actually
made it interesting,

08:17.163 --> 08:19.432
because you were actually
making it harder for him,

08:19.432 --> 08:23.236
and therefore,
crazily harder for yourself.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.471
Where would you go

08:24.471 --> 08:26.439
if you were to go through
to the next round?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.074
Does it get more dangerous?

08:28.074 --> 08:29.376
- Always more dangerous.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.000
- Anna, how do you feel
about that?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.878
- Anna, how do you feel
about that?

08:31.878 --> 08:33.546
- Why not?

08:33.546 --> 08:34.614
- Why not, indeed.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.116
Okay, we're gonna vote.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.886
I think you're both nuts,
but let's start with Howie.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.388
- Yes.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.424
- Mel.

08:44.424 --> 08:47.060
- Definite yes from me too.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.528
- Heidi?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.230
- Definitely yes from me
as well, your third yes.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.765
- And we might regret this.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.666
Four yesses, congratulations.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.876
- Aw.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.478
- Whoo, yes!

09:05.478 --> 09:06.746
- Simon, you're right.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.282
The target has never been
the centerpiece of these acts,

09:09.282 --> 09:10.717
and she is.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.288
- So proud of you guys!

09:18.258 --> 09:20.560
- Do not try this at home.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.462
- You're fantastically sick.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.596
- Thank you.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.231
- You play for
the Philadelphia Eagles.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.000
- Yeah, going into my 14th year.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.102
- What are you doing here?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.000
- I think you are
wonderfully crazy.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.472
- I think you are
wonderfully crazy.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.577
- I can't believe
we didn't get any buzzes.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.245
- Never too late.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.284
Sorry, I've got to do this.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.195
- Simon has the best accent.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.196
- Oh, wait, wait.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.098
I'm gonna try and imitate it.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.132
Hi.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.400
- No way.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.835
- Oh, I'm Simon.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.138
- I want some crumpets.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.507
- This is how Simon speaks,
like this all the time.

10:07.507 --> 10:12.045
- Yeah, he sounds
just like this, you bet.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.547
- You just have the worst
accent of them all.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.615
You have the worst.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.283
- You sound, like, Jamaican.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.922
- You are what America needs.

10:18.922 --> 10:19.953
- You are what America needs.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.388
- Was that good?
- That was really good.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.490
- Darling, sweetie,
where's Simon?

10:23.490 --> 10:25.125
Let's get it started,
darling.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.259
- That's good.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.194
- What do you guys like
so much about Simon?

10:28.194 --> 10:30.597
- He has an adorable
English accent.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.798
- Yeah.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.766
- My name is Elias.
- And my name is Zion.

10:33.766 --> 10:37.003
- We're twins,
and guess what...

10:38.505 --> 10:39.706
- Who's this lovely person?

10:39.706 --> 10:40.907
- That's our mom.

10:40.907 --> 10:42.442
- You guys excited
to be here?

10:42.442 --> 10:44.410
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we're so excited.

10:44.410 --> 10:47.280
- We love to sing, dance, act,
play piano and stuff.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.922
- We like to play piano--

10:48.922 --> 10:48.982
- We like to play piano--

10:48.982 --> 10:51.818
- And guess what,
we have a duet.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.487
- ♪ I'm so happy
to be stuck with you ♪

10:54.487 --> 10:57.223
- We've never, ever
cut our hair.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.259
- The worst thing
about having long hair,

10:59.259 --> 11:00.727
when we go to Disney World,

11:00.727 --> 11:02.662
they say,
"Come along, princesses."

11:02.662 --> 11:04.797
And we're like, "We're boys."

11:04.797 --> 11:07.500
- Oh, my gosh.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.735
- Simon!

11:08.735 --> 11:09.869
- Look at you.

11:09.869 --> 11:10.870
- Oh, my God.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.239
- Hey!
- Are you gonna be good?

11:13.239 --> 11:14.841
- Come here.
- Oh, my goodness.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.242
- Are you gonna be good?
- Yes.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.544
- I'm a big fan of you.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.578
- Oh, thank you.

11:18.578 --> 11:18.922
- So great to see you.

11:18.922 --> 11:19.579
- So great to see you.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.880
- Can you follow me
on Twitter?

11:20.880 --> 11:21.881
- Yes.

11:21.881 --> 11:22.882
- Simon Cowell.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.083
Oh, Simon!

11:24.083 --> 11:25.385
- See you later.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.619
- When we perform tonight,

11:26.619 --> 11:28.588
we're probably gonna get
a standing ovation.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.029
- Now let's get to it, guys.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.464
- ♪ Happy to be stuck with you ♪

11:42.435 --> 11:43.970

11:46.105 --> 11:47.273
- Yep.
- How are you?

11:47.273 --> 11:48.408
- Great, how are you?
- Awesome.

11:48.408 --> 11:48.922
- Tell me your names again.

11:48.922 --> 11:49.409
- Tell me your names again.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.810
- You are?
- Elias.

11:50.810 --> 11:51.811
- And how old are you, Elias?

11:51.811 --> 11:52.946
- I'm 9.

11:52.946 --> 11:53.947
- You're 9, and you are?

11:53.947 --> 11:54.948
- Zion.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.482
- And you are how old?
- 9.

11:56.482 --> 11:57.717
- 9, so you're twins.
- We're twins.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.522
- Okay, who is the naughtiest
out of the two?

12:03.990 --> 12:06.392
Yeah, I would have
guessed that.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.695
What would you do with
the $1 million if you won?

12:08.695 --> 12:11.264
- Probably spend it
on college education.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.899
- You agree?

12:12.899 --> 12:16.236
- Probably buy fast cars,
luxury watches.

12:17.971 --> 12:18.922
- Yeah, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

12:18.922 --> 12:19.772
- Yeah, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

12:19.772 --> 12:22.175
The cars and watches
sound a bit more fun.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.477
- I think when I get it,
it's gonna be fun.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.778
- Yeah.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.380
- All right, well,
good luck, guys.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.915

- Look at that,
standing ovation.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.657
- Thank you.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.459
- Thank you, guys.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.194
- I can't believe
we didn't get any buzzes.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.064
- Never too late.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.399
- Oh, my God.

13:53.399 --> 13:54.801
- Awkward.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.604
- You just said
that you can't believe--why?

13:58.604 --> 14:00.540
Did you feel
like it went wrong?

14:00.540 --> 14:03.810
- Sometimes, like,
life isn't fair, so...

14:06.212 --> 14:08.114
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.117
- In the very, very beginning,
did you miss a few notes?

14:11.117 --> 14:12.452
- I didn't hear any.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.387
It was like the best
I've ever played it so far.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.522
- Okay, I just wanted
to double-check that.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.257
- Well done, guys.
- Thank you.

14:18.257 --> 14:18.922

I do think that the two of you

14:21.494 --> 14:23.696
are extremely,
extremely talented.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.997
- My mom says it's raw talent,

14:24.997 --> 14:26.699
but it's what my mom said.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.735
- Where do they get
these personalities from?

14:28.735 --> 14:29.936
- Not me.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.137
- I was very impressed.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.338
- I think we're gonna vote.

Heidi.

of cocky arrogance about you,

20:10.643 --> 20:12.678
I'm 14 years old,
and I'm a singer.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.747
- Now, you get your singing
skills from your mom?

20:14.747 --> 20:15.748
- Yes.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.316
When I was really young,

20:17.316 --> 20:18.931
my mom, she would like sing
in the shower and everything,

20:18.931 --> 20:19.318
my mom, she would like sing
in the shower and everything,

20:19.318 --> 20:21.554
and I would be like,
"She sounds so good."

20:21.554 --> 20:23.222
And I wanted to sound like her.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.157
- You're gonna do awesome.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.859
- She's a single mom,

20:26.859 --> 20:31.130
and she's made a lot
of sacrifices for me.

20:31.130 --> 20:35.835
My mom and I live in Atlanta,
but...

20:35.835 --> 20:37.503
we lost our home there.

20:37.503 --> 20:41.607
So we're kind of, like,
in between houses right now.

20:41.607 --> 20:46.078
- Yeah, we're staying
with a neighbor.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.647
You know, finances
are not always,

20:48.647 --> 20:48.931
you know, the best thing.

20:48.931 --> 20:50.683
you know, the best thing.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.452
But this was something
that she wanted to do,

20:53.452 --> 20:55.187
and it means a lot to her.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.389
So we just packed up
and come out here,

20:57.389 --> 20:58.791
even though at home
we're dealing

20:58.791 --> 21:00.726
with a little bit of turmoil.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.795
- I'm really trying
to do my best on here,

21:02.795 --> 21:05.698
because it would mean the world
for me and my mom

21:05.698 --> 21:08.234
to have this opportunity.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.570
So when I get
on that stage tonight,

21:11.570 --> 21:13.339
I'm just gonna sing
my heart out.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.673
Yeah.

21:14.673 --> 21:16.075
- Get out there, go get 'em.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.931
Me and mom will be on the side
supporting, all right?

21:18.931 --> 21:19.044
Me and mom will be on the side

21:29.255 --> 21:31.023

- I'm 14.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.695
- Oh, wow.
- No way.

21:36.695 --> 21:39.498
- And, Jayna, who is the person
you look up to most?

21:39.498 --> 21:40.566
- My mom.

21:40.566 --> 21:41.801
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.768
- Aw.

21:42.768 --> 21:43.769
- Hi, mom.

21:43.769 --> 21:44.970
- I'm in tears, aw.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.372
- Let them tears flow.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.640
Let them tears flow.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.931
That's your baby out there.

21:48.931 --> 21:49.575
That's your baby out there.

21:49.575 --> 21:50.876
- And, Jayna,
what are you gonna sing?

21:50.876 --> 21:52.444
- I'm going to be singing
"Summertime."

21:52.444 --> 21:53.445
- Great song.

21:53.445 --> 21:54.580
Good luck.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.785
- I think she's gonna
do really well.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.931
What a voice.

23:48.931 --> 23:49.028
What a voice.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.763
So mature.

23:50.763 --> 23:53.866
As soon as the music started,
you went into your own zone

23:53.866 --> 23:55.834
and took us
right there with you.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.870
Well done.

23:57.870 --> 24:00.472
- You got on the waterproof?
- No.

24:00.472 --> 24:01.807
- You are fearless.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.042
You are fabulous.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.910
I mean, you had
everyone on their feet.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.578
I loved it.

24:06.578 --> 24:08.080
- Thank you.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.550
- You know,
it's really interesting.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.919
You're a 14-year-old
little girl.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.655
There's so much poise,
and so beyond your years,

24:16.655 --> 24:18.624
and so beautiful,
and so classic.

24:18.624 --> 24:18.931
Why did you choose that music?

24:18.931 --> 24:20.526
Why did you choose that music?

24:20.526 --> 24:22.127
- My mom, you know,
she had me listen to,

24:22.127 --> 24:24.330
like, Diana Ross
and The Temptations,

24:24.330 --> 24:28.200
and I grew up
on a lot of old stuff, so...

24:28.200 --> 24:30.135
- Jayna...

24:30.135 --> 24:33.639
I didn't like that.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.774
I loved that.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.910
Thank you so much.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.612
I also like the fact
that you understand

24:40.612 --> 24:41.947
why artists in the past

24:41.947 --> 24:43.983
are important
to what you're doing now,

24:43.983 --> 24:45.884
because I think if you're
not interested

24:45.884 --> 24:47.353
in some of the greats,

24:47.353 --> 24:48.931
then it's very difficult to
become a great person yourself.

24:48.931 --> 24:50.022
then it's very difficult to
become a great person yourself.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.390
I love your voice.

24:51.390 --> 24:54.093
But most importantly,
you've got that confidence.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.894
Really, one of my
favorite auditions.

24:55.894 --> 24:57.596
- Thank you.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.098
- They got to vote now.

24:59.098 --> 25:02.334
- Howie.
- Absolutely, yes.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.869
- Yes, yes, yes.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.204
- Thank you so much.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.205
- Yes.

25:06.205 --> 25:07.940

25:21.754 --> 25:22.921

25:26.325 --> 25:28.127

- Okay.

25:45.577 --> 25:48.931

25:48.931 --> 25:49.281
- What else have you got?

25:49.281 --> 25:50.783
- Ah!

25:50.783 --> 25:53.419
- I think we may have found
someone special with you.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.653
I've got to do this.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.795
- And look at you.
- Look at you.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.896
- Look at me.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.898
- You're so bright
and chirpy.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.999
- Chirpy?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.333
- It's your wife's,
isn't it?

26:08.333 --> 26:09.868
- No!
- No?

26:09.868 --> 26:11.270
- This is mine;
I bought it.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.105
Does it look like
I'm wearing a ladies' jacket?

26:13.105 --> 26:14.873
- Yes.

26:14.873 --> 26:16.775
- Look, so many talents here.

26:16.775 --> 26:19.411
Singers, dancers.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.881
But what we're gonna do,
I guess it's really special.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.850
We're gonna amaze them.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.085
I am a tailor,

26:26.085 --> 26:28.587
and I like to design
different costumes

26:28.587 --> 26:28.891
in different styles.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.122
in different styles.

26:30.122 --> 26:32.324
I love this dress.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.892
- Oh, wow,
that's really bright.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.861
- In a positive way?

26:35.861 --> 26:37.463
- I don't know.

26:37.463 --> 26:38.897
- But, then again,
he's a comedian.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.099
He's supposed to make
you laugh.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.467
- I wasn't going for funny.

26:42.501 --> 26:44.636
- This wasn't funny.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.939
- The best thing about our act

26:46.939 --> 26:51.543
is to see my wife changing
clothes all day long.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.045
- Mm-hmm.
- Meow.

26:53.045 --> 26:57.349
- It keeps our relationship
fresh, fun, and sexy.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.450
- Ah.

26:58.450 --> 26:58.891
- But it's true.

26:58.891 --> 27:00.252
- But it's true.

27:00.252 --> 27:03.155
To see our names
on the lights in Vegas,

27:03.155 --> 27:04.590
it's our dream.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.791
- We're gonna do this.
- Yeah.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.659
- Go get 'em, have fun.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.068
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.302
- Who are you guys?

27:17.302 --> 27:18.770
- My name is Sauce.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.072
- My name is Victoria.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.306
- Are you married?

27:21.306 --> 27:22.608
- Yes, we are married.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.643
- This year gonna be
20 years we are together.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.811
- 20 years?
- Yes.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.379
- Wow.
- Wow.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.085
- And what will you
be doing for us today?

27:33.085 --> 27:34.953
- We're gonna show you
a very special set

27:34.953 --> 27:37.656
which we prepared
for this show.

27:37.656 --> 27:38.824
- Okay.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.426
- And all the costumes
you're gonna see,

27:41.426 --> 27:43.228
it's made by us.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.564
- Including the one your wife
is wearing right now?

27:45.564 --> 27:46.565
- Yes.

27:46.565 --> 27:48.000
- You designed that?
- Yes.

27:48.000 --> 27:48.967
- Okay, I can't wait to see it.

27:48.967 --> 27:49.968
Good luck.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.004
- Thank you.

It was fabulous.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.868

30:02.868 --> 30:04.770
- You managed
to pop color in there,

30:04.770 --> 30:07.039
length, design, patterns.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.840
It was so entertaining.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.410
It was brilliant.

30:11.410 --> 30:12.477
- This was beautiful.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.313
I love that you're
really a couple.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.681
I thought the costumes
were great.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.948
It was quick.

30:16.948 --> 30:18.650
Also, something you never
hear in your house is,

30:18.650 --> 30:19.685
"Are you ready yet?"

30:19.685 --> 30:20.819
Because she's always...

30:22.988 --> 30:24.122
- The act is fantastic.

30:24.122 --> 30:27.159
I mean, it was quick, slick.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.891
I have no idea how you did it.

30:28.891 --> 30:29.561
I have no idea how you did it.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.997
I thought the dancing
was pretty bad, but...

30:31.997 --> 30:33.465
- I knew you were
gonna say that.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.033
- It was a bit corny.

30:35.033 --> 30:37.302
But one of the best we've seen,
congratulations.

30:38.303 --> 30:40.038
- We still have to vote--Howie?

30:40.038 --> 30:41.306
- Yes.

30:41.306 --> 30:42.307
- Mel?

30:42.307 --> 30:43.809
- It's a yes from me.

30:43.809 --> 30:44.943
- Simon?

30:44.943 --> 30:46.211
- It's a yes from me.

30:46.211 --> 30:49.348
- And I'm gonna give you
a fourth yes.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.949
Congratulations.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.255
Very good.

31:00.492 --> 31:02.160

31:02.160 --> 31:04.196
- We did it.
- Wow, congratulations.

31:04.196 --> 31:05.197
- You see, they love it.

31:05.197 --> 31:06.431
- They loved it.

31:06.431 --> 31:08.333
- I want to do this too now.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.002
- That was amazing.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.012
- I can do a little bit
of singing.

31:21.012 --> 31:22.047
- Don't do it,
don't do it.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.248
- Nat King Cole.
- Oh, my gosh.

31:23.248 --> 31:25.016
- Okay, listen, listen, listen.

31:25.016 --> 31:28.754
- ♪ Smile,
though your heart... ♪

31:28.754 --> 31:30.322
- So I'm trying to collect
over a billion smiles

31:30.322 --> 31:32.691
in my mirror hat.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.326
- What I believe

31:34.326 --> 31:37.529
is that it's
an upside-down smile.

31:37.529 --> 31:41.400
I'm having the time
of my life.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.739
- I just didn't get it.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.510
- It's just maybe not
for this stage right here.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.512
- Heidi--I mean, you could
just look at that smile,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.247
and you'll be star-struck.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.616
If I can get one smile
out of her,

31:57.616 --> 31:59.184
that's all I ask,
is just one smile.

31:59.184 --> 32:00.719
Maybe a hug or a kiss
or two, maybe.

32:00.719 --> 32:02.554
- Okay.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.822
- You guys look fantastic.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.624
There's not a hair
out of place on you guys.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.026
- Thank you, thank you.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.998
- It was all a bit too happy.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.132
- You're enjoying yourself.

32:14.132 --> 32:14.940
I didn't quite enjoy myself.

32:14.940 --> 32:17.536
I didn't quite enjoy myself.

32:17.536 --> 32:21.440
- There's something about Simon,
like, when he's just going...

32:21.440 --> 32:23.108
- That makes me so nervous.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.610
- You know, it's like,
can you smile?

32:25.610 --> 32:27.212
- Good smiles there,
smiles, smiles.

32:27.212 --> 32:32.017
- ♪ You'll find that life
is still worthwhile ♪

32:32.017 --> 32:33.318
- A little bit too much smiling.

32:33.318 --> 32:34.753
- What's wrong with that?

32:34.753 --> 32:37.289
- When you're constantly
having people smile at you

32:37.289 --> 32:39.391
for three minutes, it does--

32:39.391 --> 32:40.926
it's almost too much.

32:44.629 --> 32:44.940
- So, what brings you over here
this way today?

32:44.940 --> 32:48.366
- So, what brings you over here
this way today?

32:48.366 --> 32:51.636
- A giant airplane
and my talent.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.904
I'm Robert.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.339
I used to be in business.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.708
I used to wear a suit and tie
and have my hair cut short.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.710
I enjoyed it,
but it wasn't in my heart.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.480
My heart was seeing
people smile and laugh.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.582
- Yeah, I have
so many butterflies, but...

33:03.582 --> 33:05.016
- Well, I can see
why you have butterflies,

33:05.016 --> 33:07.118
because you're beautiful
as a butterfly.

33:07.118 --> 33:08.320
When somebody smiles,

33:08.320 --> 33:10.655
It's like magic sunshine
even in the shade.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.558
I love how you turned your hand
into a visor,

33:13.558 --> 33:14.659
beautiful natural visor.

33:14.659 --> 33:14.940
Great job, sir.

33:14.940 --> 33:16.127
Great job, sir.

33:16.127 --> 33:19.631
My main goal is to see the
judges and the audience smile.

33:19.631 --> 33:22.167

- I'm Robert the Compliment Man.

33:32.978 --> 33:35.514
- Robert the Compliment Man.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.882
What do you do for a living?

33:36.882 --> 33:41.586
- I give compliments full-time.

33:41.586 --> 33:42.621
- Can I ask you a question?

33:42.621 --> 33:44.689
What did you do
before you did this?

33:44.689 --> 33:44.940
- I was a businessman
for many years.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.157
- I was a businessman
for many years.

33:46.157 --> 33:47.225
- Doing what?

33:47.225 --> 33:48.960
- Bottled water,
designing machines,

33:48.960 --> 33:51.763
basically on a piece of paper,
and doing magic with the water.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.732
- And then what was
the light bulb moment

33:53.732 --> 33:56.368
when you went, "I'm gonna go
from that to this"?

33:56.368 --> 33:57.769
- The light bulb was the stress,

33:57.769 --> 34:01.072
trading stress for smiles
created by compliments.

34:05.443 --> 34:07.612
- Well, best of luck.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.548
- Thank you.

34:15.086 --> 34:17.956
- I'd like to compliment
the audience on parking.

34:17.956 --> 34:20.225
No one double-parked,

34:20.225 --> 34:22.761
and just about every single car
was locked.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.501
Simon!

34:29.501 --> 34:31.536
I love your blunt honesty.

34:34.105 --> 34:35.640
- Okay, we knew that
was gonna happen.

34:35.640 --> 34:38.076
- Simon doesn't seem impressed.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.512
- Something--something smells...

34:40.512 --> 34:41.546
really nice.

34:41.546 --> 34:42.747
Howie.

34:48.119 --> 34:51.122
And, Heidi, I really love
the way you do this.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.231
- One more.

35:00.231 --> 35:01.700
- Just me left.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.502
- Mel B!

35:04.502 --> 35:08.306
I love how you shorten your name
into a single letter "B,"

35:08.306 --> 35:11.509
being beautiful,
being spicy.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.679
- I like that compliment.

35:14.679 --> 35:14.940
- And, Mel, I love your
beautiful, perfect nose a lot.

35:14.940 --> 35:21.720
- And, Mel, I love your

35:21.720 --> 35:23.822

35:31.429 --> 35:34.532
- Guess people
don't like compliments.

35:34.532 --> 35:38.103
- I'm gonna let Simon start
with the first compliment.

35:38.103 --> 35:40.071
- All right, sounds good.

35:40.071 --> 35:43.942
- You're mad, so it's a no.

35:43.942 --> 35:44.940
- Heidi.
- It's a no.

35:44.940 --> 35:45.243
- Heidi.
- It's a no.

35:45.243 --> 35:46.244
- Okay.

35:46.244 --> 35:48.380
- Mel, you seem
to be the last one.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.814
- I was the last one,

35:49.814 --> 35:52.384
because I actually wanted
more compliments.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.888
So, because I didn't get
that many,

35:56.888 --> 35:59.624
it's a no from me too.

35:59.624 --> 36:02.460
- Robert, you have four no's.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.762
- Okay.

36:03.762 --> 36:06.965
- So you are one of the most
consistently bad acts

36:06.965 --> 36:08.299

36:08.299 --> 36:09.334

36:31.589 --> 36:33.124
So I'll take them as kisses.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.427
- "X"s can be kisses too.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.162

36:37.162 --> 36:38.596

going into my 14th year
in the NFL.

37:09.327 --> 37:10.528

37:10.528 --> 37:12.163

37:25.810 --> 37:28.780

37:28.780 --> 37:29.848
- I know that name.

37:29.848 --> 37:30.849
- You a sports guy?

37:30.849 --> 37:31.883
- I am.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.651
You play for
the Philadelphia Eagles.

37:33.651 --> 37:36.154
- Yeah, yeah,
I'm going into--yeah.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.723
- Wow.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.725

he's gonna do?

37:40.725 --> 37:41.893
- Going into my 14th year.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.561
- 14th year.
- Wow.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.163
- What are you doing here?

37:45.163 --> 37:46.871
- You know,
as much as we can achieve,

37:46.871 --> 37:46.931
- You know,
as much as we can achieve,

37:46.931 --> 37:48.199
there's always new beginnings,

37:48.199 --> 37:50.735
and there's always
new things to do.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.003
So, in the off-season,

37:52.003 --> 37:53.805
I tour around and do magic
and comedy and stuff.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.074
- Oh, wow.

37:56.074 --> 37:59.210
- I was 13 years old when I saw
my first magician.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.211
He did the sponge ball trick.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.846
Went in my hand,
I closed my hand,

38:01.846 --> 38:03.348
I opened it up,
and I had a bunch of them.

38:03.348 --> 38:05.517
Mind blown, and it changed
my life forever.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.018
- Do you do magic
for your teammates ever?

38:07.018 --> 38:08.653
- It's cool, yeah,
like, so plane rides.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.722
Obviously is a great way
to kill time on plane rides.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.724
Literally, in games,
there'll be players

38:12.724 --> 38:14.225
kind of
that I'm playing against

38:14.225 --> 38:15.593
that'll be like, "Yeah,
what's up now, magic man?

38:15.593 --> 38:16.871
Here I come, magic man, ooh!"

38:16.871 --> 38:17.395
Here I come, magic man, ooh!"

38:17.395 --> 38:18.396
You know what I mean?

38:18.396 --> 38:19.697
So you get the trash talk.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.833
But magic is a joy
inside of me.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.501
Performing is a part
of my heart.

38:23.501 --> 38:26.271
And it also takes me back
to when I was a kid.

38:26.271 --> 38:28.373
The reason I'm here today
is to share with people

38:28.373 --> 38:29.974
that there is a different
side of me.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.910
Hopefully they dig it
and don't sit there and say,

38:31.910 --> 38:34.179
"Huh...

38:34.179 --> 38:35.413
"Stick to your day job, kid.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.415
Stick to your day job."

38:41.352 --> 38:42.954
- Hey, let me ask you
a question, John.

38:42.954 --> 38:44.856
This goes well.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.224
You win.

38:46.224 --> 38:46.871
Then what do you do?

38:46.871 --> 38:47.592
Then what do you do?

38:47.592 --> 38:49.794
- Well, let's be honest, the NFL
stands for Not For Long.

38:49.794 --> 38:50.929
So, I've been lucky here.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.764
So you always got to have
a backup plan.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.066
This is a pretty good one,
you know what I'm saying?

38:55.066 --> 38:56.301
- Show us your magic, go ahead.

38:56.301 --> 38:57.302
- We ready?

38:57.302 --> 39:01.072
Let's rock this out.

39:01.072 --> 39:03.107
Here's the deal;
I love this.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.442
So here's a paper clip.

39:04.442 --> 39:05.643
You're gonna do me
a huge favor.

39:05.643 --> 39:06.744
- Okay.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.146
- All I want you to do
is say stop.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.514
- Stop.
- Okay, I'm gonna cut the cards.

39:09.514 --> 39:10.849
- Whatever this is,
we're not gonna look at it.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.383
This gets folded up

39:12.383 --> 39:13.685
and it gets placed
in this paper clip right here.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.353
Mel B, this is gonna
go in front of you.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.871
When I was a kid,
I was fascinated

39:16.871 --> 39:16.921
When I was a kid,
I was fascinated

39:16.921 --> 39:18.156
by counting cards.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.490
This isn't 100%,

39:19.490 --> 39:21.192
but hopefully you're gonna
notice a pattern here.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.360
We're gonna shoot one out,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.329
and hopefully
it'll look familiar.

39:24.329 --> 39:25.897
Look, see,
there's an ace.

39:25.897 --> 39:26.931
I tell you what,

39:26.931 --> 39:28.299
all I need you to do
is pull one out.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.567
- You want me
to pull one out?

39:29.567 --> 39:30.802
- Yeah, you're gonna
pull a card out.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.403
You got to reach in there
and just pull one out.

39:32.403 --> 39:33.471
- You got it?
- Yep.

39:33.471 --> 39:34.505
- Show everybody
what it is.

39:34.505 --> 39:35.607
Watch, this is gonna be sick.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.075
It's gonna be a 2.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.643
Oh...

39:38.643 --> 39:39.844
- Is that bad?

39:39.844 --> 39:41.079
- That's okay, watch the 8.

39:41.079 --> 39:42.080
It's a shake.

39:42.080 --> 39:43.147
Watch the 8,
see, it's a shake,

39:43.147 --> 39:44.215
and we can get the 2 out.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.216
See what I mean?
See what we did there?

39:45.216 --> 39:46.417
You know what I'm saying?

39:46.417 --> 39:46.871
- Ooh, okay.

39:46.871 --> 39:48.219
- Ooh, okay.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.888
- The number one trick
by a comedy magician

39:49.888 --> 39:52.991
is pull it out of your--
so, look, there's a 3.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.759
Hopefully we can shoot one
out of the center.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.427
Look, there's a 4
right there.

39:56.427 --> 39:59.264
So, Mel, all I need you
to do is just yell out stop.

39:59.264 --> 40:00.398
Watch, riffle, go.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.432
- Stop.

40:01.432 --> 40:02.700
- Okay,
take that card right there.

40:02.700 --> 40:03.902
If that's the 5, that's sick.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.905
Check it out, see if we got it.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.439
- Oh, my gosh.

40:08.439 --> 40:11.910
- Wow!

40:11.910 --> 40:13.311
- That's good.

40:13.311 --> 40:14.445
- So right now,

40:14.445 --> 40:16.281
I think the 6
is 38 cards from the top.

40:16.281 --> 40:16.871
So we're gonna kind of shoot one
out here, boom.

40:16.871 --> 40:17.982
So we're gonna kind of shoot one
out here, boom.

40:17.982 --> 40:19.918
Look, there's the 6.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.185
Simon, do me a favor.

40:21.185 --> 40:22.987
If you watch the 10 here,
we can just cover it.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.689
See, there's the 7.

40:24.689 --> 40:26.257
- Howie, you ready?
- I am ready.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.759
- Okay, say stop.
- Stop.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.661
- Okay, we need the 8.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.662
- What do we got?

40:30.662 --> 40:31.796
Show it right here.

40:31.796 --> 40:33.264
We need the 8
for the crowd, show them.

40:33.264 --> 40:34.766
- Oh.
- There it is.

40:37.302 --> 40:38.970
- I put a card in my pocket
before we started.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.305
See, there's the 9
right there.

40:40.305 --> 40:42.273
Now, watch, we're gonna
cut these up like this.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.942
And hopefully we can find
the 10, the jack,

40:43.942 --> 40:44.943
the queen, the king.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.377
- Oh, my God.

40:46.377 --> 40:46.871
- There's the 10,
the jack, the queen.

40:46.871 --> 40:49.580
- There's the 10,
the jack, the queen.

40:49.580 --> 40:50.882
So, Simon, do me a favor.

40:50.882 --> 40:51.883
Think of any card you want to.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.184
Don't name it out loud yet.

40:53.184 --> 40:54.352
Okay, this is gonna be good.

40:54.352 --> 40:55.787
- Do you got it?
- Yeah.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.822
- Watch this;
we're gonna shuffle these up.

40:57.822 --> 40:59.924
Simon, name the card you're
thinking of right now.

40:59.924 --> 41:01.726
- 3 of clubs.
- 3 of clubs.

41:01.726 --> 41:03.861
- I did this because I thought
I would go through here

41:03.861 --> 41:05.530
and not just shuffle
all the cards,

41:05.530 --> 41:07.966
but take all of them
and shuffle all those clubs

41:07.966 --> 41:09.434
back in order like that.

41:09.434 --> 41:10.902
- No.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.870
- No way.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.405
- Had you said hearts,
and said what the hey,

41:14.405 --> 41:16.871
why don't we shuffle
all the hearts in order?

41:16.871 --> 41:18.009
why don't we shuffle
all the hearts in order?

41:18.009 --> 41:19.911
Had you said spades,
we would have actually

41:19.911 --> 41:23.247
shuffled all the spades
in order just like that.

41:23.247 --> 41:25.950
- How do you do that?

41:25.950 --> 41:28.086
- Before we started,
we folded a card,

41:28.086 --> 41:30.455
we put it in a paper clip,
and we didn't look at it.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.693
The card you thought of,
the 3 of clubs,

41:35.693 --> 41:37.562
right there for Simon,
in the paper clip.

41:37.562 --> 41:38.796
Thank you guys very much.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.032
I'm Jon Dorenbos, peace out!

41:43.634 --> 41:46.871
- How did he do that?

41:46.871 --> 41:47.538
- How did he do that?

41:47.538 --> 41:48.539
- Thank you.

41:48.539 --> 41:49.540
- That was crazy.

41:49.540 --> 41:51.809
- That was fun.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.411
- Oh, my God.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.279
- My man, right there.

41:59.617 --> 42:00.618
- You're bewildered.

42:00.618 --> 42:02.420
Simon, talk, use words.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.958
I don't know what to say.

42:06.958 --> 42:10.428
I don't know how the hell
you did that,

42:10.428 --> 42:12.530
because I could see
it never moved.

42:12.530 --> 42:15.033
For someone who doesn't
do this professionally,

42:15.033 --> 42:16.871
it was so slick, so fast.

42:16.871 --> 42:17.001
it was so slick, so fast.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.636
Your dialogue is great.

42:18.636 --> 42:20.371
It's not a trick,
because it's magic.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.372
It was amazing.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.440
- My man.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.975
- I'm really impressed.
- Thank you.

42:23.975 --> 42:26.611
- Well done.
- My man, thank you.

42:26.611 --> 42:27.612
- Heidi.

42:27.612 --> 42:28.713
- I loved it too.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.248
And you're fast
with your hands.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.349
You're fast with your mouth.

42:31.349 --> 42:32.817
You're charming;
I loved it.

42:32.817 --> 42:34.152
You were right here
in front of us,

42:34.152 --> 42:35.920
and I have no idea
how you did it.

42:35.920 --> 42:37.255
- Thank you.

42:37.255 --> 42:38.256
- Mel B.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.624
- I still can't get over that.

42:39.624 --> 42:41.492
That was the very first card

42:41.492 --> 42:44.028
before you even started
any of these tricks.

42:44.028 --> 42:45.463
- That should not
have happened.

42:45.463 --> 42:46.871
- You put that
right in front of me.

42:46.871 --> 42:47.231
- You put that
right in front of me.

42:47.231 --> 42:48.699
And I kept my eye on this card.

42:48.699 --> 42:50.701
This card did not move.

42:50.701 --> 42:53.271
That is just shockingly good.

42:53.271 --> 42:54.605
- I just want to say something.

42:54.605 --> 42:55.807
You have a gift,

42:55.807 --> 42:58.176
and it's the gift
of making magic happen

42:58.176 --> 43:00.311
for you and for others.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.246
And this was just not only
a very entertaining

43:02.246 --> 43:04.048
and funny moment,

43:04.048 --> 43:05.683
but just an amazing moment,

43:05.683 --> 43:06.984
and I'm so glad
that you're here.

43:06.984 --> 43:08.386

43:12.190 --> 43:13.357

43:13.357 --> 43:14.425

43:14.425 --> 43:16.861

43:16.861 --> 43:16.871

43:16.871 --> 43:17.962

43:21.666 --> 43:23.267

43:24.268 --> 43:25.603
- I love ya!

43:28.606 --> 43:29.874
- How'd it feel?

43:29.874 --> 43:31.275
- It's really cool to come
and walk in a theater

43:31.275 --> 43:33.945
with over 2, 000 people
with a deck of cards.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.813

talking about, man.

43:35.813 --> 43:38.449
- Wow.

was awesome.

49:45.549 --> 49:49.053

got good voices,

52:30.648 --> 52:33.017
but now you have to go

52:33.017 --> 52:34.251
I'm really sorry, guys.

52:34.251 --> 52:35.452

52:39.523 --> 52:42.559

playing the piano
on that song.

53:06.894 --> 53:07.985
playing the piano
on that song.

53:07.985 --> 53:10.788
I'm not gonna lie and say
that was a fantastic audition,

53:10.788 --> 53:12.856
because it wasn't.

53:12.856 --> 53:13.857
- I'm gonna go grab Mike's phone

when I heard you

53:31.975 --> 53:34.511
and I thought, actually,
this girl could be really good.

53:34.511 --> 53:36.894
But then other times,
it wasn't great.

53:36.894 --> 53:39.883
But then other times,
it wasn't great.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.885
I'm gonna say no.

53:43.320 --> 53:45.989
- Such a shame,
because she's talented.

53:45.989 --> 53:48.258
- And that wasn't
good enough.

53:48.258 --> 53:50.427
- And I go and stand
on that "X" right there?

53:50.427 --> 53:52.062
- Mm-hmm, right on
the "X" over there.

53:52.062 --> 53:53.430
- That big old "X"?
- That big old "X."

53:53.430 --> 53:54.531
- Here we go.

53:54.531 --> 53:56.533
There it is,
walk that walk.

53:56.533 --> 53:58.202
That's what I'm
talking about.

54:05.743 --> 54:06.894
- Hello.

54:06.894 --> 54:07.111
- Hello.

54:07.111 --> 54:08.278
- Hi.

54:08.278 --> 54:09.279
- What's your name?

54:09.279 --> 54:10.748
- My name is Ronnie Martin.

54:10.748 --> 54:12.750
- How old are you Ronnie,
if you don't mind me asking?

54:12.750 --> 54:14.184
- I am 62.
- Wow.

54:14.184 --> 54:16.520
- You look good.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.655
- She doesn't look
like she's 62.

54:18.655 --> 54:20.557
- You're in good shape.
- Thank you.

54:20.557 --> 54:22.459
- So, are you married?

54:22.459 --> 54:23.927
- No.

54:23.927 --> 54:25.729
- Okay, you have kids?

54:25.729 --> 54:27.131
- No.

54:27.131 --> 54:29.600
But I have lots of nieces
and nephews and godchildren.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.635
I love them all, yes, I do.

54:31.635 --> 54:33.237
- I'm single.

54:33.237 --> 54:36.240
Just saying, 62 ain't
nothing but a number.

54:36.240 --> 54:36.894
- And do you work?

54:36.894 --> 54:37.341
- And do you work?

54:37.341 --> 54:38.509
- I work a 9-to-5.

54:38.509 --> 54:39.510
- Don't what?

54:39.510 --> 54:42.246
- I work as an assistant.

54:42.246 --> 54:43.814
- For?
- At a law firm.

54:43.814 --> 54:45.115
- Okay, and why are you here?

54:45.115 --> 54:46.116
Do you sing?

54:46.116 --> 54:47.117
- Yes.

54:47.117 --> 54:48.452
- Over the years,

54:48.452 --> 54:50.087
you've tried to get
a record deal, I presume.

54:50.087 --> 54:52.322
- You know, I was close,
close, close, close, close,

54:52.322 --> 54:54.558
and it just didn't happen.

54:54.558 --> 54:57.628
- And, look, the whole point
of this show is,.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.062
for me, it doesn't matter
how old you are.

54:59.062 --> 55:00.164
If you've got it,
you've got it.

55:00.164 --> 55:01.698
Is that how you're
feeling now?

55:01.698 --> 55:03.667
- Absolutely.

55:05.769 --> 55:06.894
Before I lose it,
I need to get it.

55:06.894 --> 55:07.671
Before I lose it,
I need to get it.

55:07.671 --> 55:09.807
Before I lose it.

55:09.807 --> 55:12.142
- Okay, well, Ronnie,
best of luck.

55:12.142 --> 55:13.443
I hope it goes well.

55:13.443 --> 55:14.578
- Thank you.

55:14.578 --> 55:15.779
Pull it together.

55:15.779 --> 55:17.080
Hmm.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.586
- Hit it.

right there.

58:50.894 --> 58:52.629
- Thank you, thank you.

58:57.467 --> 59:00.270
- That second song,
you really showcased

59:00.270 --> 59:03.106
what a talented singer you are.

59:03.106 --> 59:04.207
And when that chorus hit,

59:04.207 --> 59:06.209
you took it all the way there.

59:06.209 --> 59:06.894
You were not afraid of it
at all.

59:06.894 --> 59:09.913
You were not afraid of it
at all.

59:09.913 --> 59:14.151
So thank you for that.

59:14.151 --> 59:16.153
- I think it was unnatural.

59:16.153 --> 59:17.154
It was beautiful.

59:17.154 --> 59:18.388
You were spectacular.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.290
And you should be a star.

59:23.927 --> 59:25.395
- Yeah, the first song you sang,

59:25.395 --> 59:27.864
in my head,
I was already saying no.

59:27.864 --> 59:29.399
I would have.

59:29.399 --> 59:32.402
And, you know, when Simon
made you sing the second song,

59:32.402 --> 59:33.670
I don't know what happened,

59:33.670 --> 59:35.405
but your voice
all of a sudden transformed

59:35.405 --> 59:36.894
into something
that was really amazing.

59:36.894 --> 59:38.075
into something
that was really amazing.

59:41.845 --> 59:43.113
- Ronnie, you know what?

59:43.113 --> 59:45.449
You have an amazing voice,
fantastic personality.

59:45.449 --> 59:46.683
- Thank you.

59:46.683 --> 59:49.219
- But now you have
to become relevant and current,

59:49.219 --> 59:52.456
and the whole idea of this show
is to give people like you

59:52.456 --> 59:54.758
a chance maybe other people
wouldn't give.

59:54.758 --> 59:56.193
Because I can't deny the fact

59:56.193 --> 59:57.928
you have a fantastic voice,
Ronnie.

59:57.928 --> 59:59.396
- Oh, my gosh.

59:59.396 --> 1:00:01.531
- And a great spirit.

1:00:05.135 --> 1:00:06.636
But we're gonna make
an important decision

1:00:06.636 --> 1:00:06.894
about you now, Ronnie.

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:07.637
about you now, Ronnie.

1:00:07.637 --> 1:00:09.272
We're gonna vote.

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:10.941
Let me start with Howie.

1:00:10.941 --> 1:00:12.509
- You know, I'm gonna go
by what I heard,

1:00:12.509 --> 1:00:13.977
and what I heard was phenomenal,

1:00:13.977 --> 1:00:16.179
and there is no way
to say no to phenomenal,

1:00:16.179 --> 1:00:19.282
so it's a yes.

1:00:19.282 --> 1:00:20.484
- Mel?

1:00:20.484 --> 1:00:21.585
- Your voice is incredible,

1:00:21.585 --> 1:00:23.186
so I'm gonna give you
your second yes.

1:00:23.186 --> 1:00:26.356
- Thank you.

1:00:26.356 --> 1:00:28.458
- And I'm gonna give you
your third yes.

1:00:31.194 --> 1:00:33.296
- Ronnie...

1:00:33.296 --> 1:00:35.398
We're on our way,
four yesses.

1:01:01.525 --> 1:01:02.792
- I did it!

1:01:02.792 --> 1:01:05.762
- Dang, you are on your way.

1:01:17.941 --> 1:01:19.442
426...

1:01:19.442 --> 1:01:20.977
427...

1:01:20.977 --> 1:01:22.679
and 428,

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:25.148
please make your way
to the door.

1:01:25.148 --> 1:01:27.250
- We got long numbers.

1:01:27.250 --> 1:01:28.251
- Yeah.

1:01:28.251 --> 1:01:29.953
- We got to wait
for a long time.

1:01:29.953 --> 1:01:30.954
- Here we go.

1:01:40.297 --> 1:01:40.867
- Um... no?

1:01:40.867 --> 1:01:42.032
- Um... no?

1:01:44.935 --> 1:01:46.803
- Okay, come on, next.

1:01:50.307 --> 1:01:51.875
- He's drinking tea.

1:01:58.014 --> 1:01:59.783
- Did you singe
your hair a bit?

1:01:59.783 --> 1:02:02.219
- Uh, yeah, I probably did.

1:02:04.254 --> 1:02:05.689
- Are we at the act yet?

1:02:05.689 --> 1:02:08.558
- That was honestly the most
boring thing I've ever seen.

1:02:11.061 --> 1:02:12.696
- Can I start over?

1:02:12.696 --> 1:02:15.932
- Oh, my God.

1:02:15.932 --> 1:02:17.167
- Oh, my God.

1:02:17.167 --> 1:02:19.869
- There is $1 million
at stake.

1:02:19.869 --> 1:02:21.571
- At stake, yes.

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:24.641
- Just back to planet earth.

1:02:26.343 --> 1:02:28.278
- I would wear that.

1:02:28.278 --> 1:02:30.513
With these shoes
and that cape,

1:02:30.513 --> 1:02:32.515
set it off.

1:02:36.486 --> 1:02:37.520
- Hello, judges.

1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:38.588
- Hi.

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:39.856
- How you doing, all right?

1:02:39.856 --> 1:02:40.867
- Good, how are you?

1:02:40.867 --> 1:02:40.924
- Good, how are you?

1:02:40.924 --> 1:02:41.958
- I'm very good, thank you.

1:02:41.958 --> 1:02:43.126

1:02:43.126 --> 1:02:44.127
- Where are you from?

1:02:44.127 --> 1:02:45.161
- Las Vegas.

1:02:45.161 --> 1:02:46.162
- Wow, what an outfit.

1:02:46.162 --> 1:02:47.230
What's your name?

1:02:47.230 --> 1:02:48.431
- I am The Baron.

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:50.100
The Baron of the Universe,
darling.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:51.401
- Of course you are.

1:02:51.401 --> 1:02:53.470
- Baron, what's your real name?

1:02:53.470 --> 1:02:54.671
- Micah.

1:02:54.671 --> 1:02:55.772
- Micah.
- Yeah.

1:02:55.772 --> 1:02:57.240
- How old are you, Micah?
- 35.

1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.808
- Why have you entered
the show?

1:02:58.808 --> 1:03:00.543
- Because I want to win the show

1:03:00.543 --> 1:03:03.013
and create the best possible
show in Las Vegas.

1:03:03.013 --> 1:03:04.281
- Okay, now you got to show us.

1:03:04.281 --> 1:03:05.515
- Please.
- Good luck.

1:03:05.515 --> 1:03:08.785
- Thank you.

1:03:39.549 --> 1:03:40.867

1:03:40.867 --> 1:03:41.117

1:05:01.398 --> 1:05:03.400
- I need a break.

1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:04.401
- Simon?

1:05:04.401 --> 1:05:06.603
- Uh, my nipples hurt.

1:05:08.104 --> 1:05:09.706
- Do you like doing that?

1:05:09.706 --> 1:05:10.867
- I absolutely love doing that.

1:05:10.867 --> 1:05:11.708
- I absolutely love doing that.

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:13.109
- Why?

1:05:13.109 --> 1:05:14.844
- It feels good.

1:05:14.844 --> 1:05:16.446
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:05:16.446 --> 1:05:17.747
- It feels good, yeah.

1:05:17.747 --> 1:05:19.582
- Mel, did you like it?

1:05:19.582 --> 1:05:20.784
- It's not my cup of tea,

1:05:20.784 --> 1:05:22.719
but I actually get
what you're doing.

1:05:22.719 --> 1:05:24.554
Some people absolutely
love this.

1:05:24.554 --> 1:05:25.655
They love to watch it.

1:05:25.655 --> 1:05:26.856
They're addicted to it.

1:05:26.856 --> 1:05:28.925
They love piercings
and hanging things

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:33.797
and pulling at things
that shouldn't be pulled at.

1:05:33.797 --> 1:05:35.665
So, even though
I didn't watch it,

1:05:35.665 --> 1:05:36.699
I get it.

1:05:36.699 --> 1:05:37.700
- Thank you, darling.

1:05:37.700 --> 1:05:38.668
Thank you very much.

1:05:38.668 --> 1:05:39.669
- Simon?

1:05:39.669 --> 1:05:40.804
- There's something about you.

1:05:40.804 --> 1:05:40.867
You know, when I was a kid

1:05:40.867 --> 1:05:42.172
You know, when I was a kid

1:05:42.172 --> 1:05:43.573
and I used to watch
a horror movie

1:05:43.573 --> 1:05:45.642
from behind a sofa.

1:05:45.642 --> 1:05:48.645
I kind of want to peek my head
around and see more of you,

1:05:48.645 --> 1:05:51.581
because you're
fantastically sick.

1:05:53.583 --> 1:05:55.118
- All right, let's vote, guys.

1:05:55.118 --> 1:05:56.719
I mean, I had
a really hard time,

1:05:56.719 --> 1:05:57.921
so I'm gonna say no.

1:05:57.921 --> 1:05:58.922
I'm sorry.

1:05:58.922 --> 1:06:00.023
Mel?

1:06:00.023 --> 1:06:01.491
- You're a very sick man,

1:06:01.491 --> 1:06:02.692
but I love it.

1:06:02.692 --> 1:06:04.360
It's a yes.

1:06:06.396 --> 1:06:07.697
- Howie?

1:06:07.697 --> 1:06:09.265
- This is the show
where we see things

1:06:09.265 --> 1:06:10.867
we've never seen before,
so I'm a big fan of this.

1:06:10.867 --> 1:06:11.501
we've never seen before,
so I'm a big fan of this.

1:06:11.501 --> 1:06:12.602
I'm giving you a yes.

1:06:12.602 --> 1:06:13.903
- Thank you.

1:06:13.903 --> 1:06:17.574
- What are you prepared
to attach next

1:06:17.574 --> 1:06:19.142
if you go through
to the next round?

1:06:19.142 --> 1:06:21.144
- Dragster.

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:22.979
- Attached to what?

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:24.414
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

1:06:24.414 --> 1:06:27.750
- Talk about calling AAA.

1:06:27.750 --> 1:06:28.785
- I'm gonna say yes.

1:06:28.785 --> 1:06:30.186
- Thank you very much.

1:06:30.186 --> 1:06:31.187
- See you in the next round.

1:06:31.187 --> 1:06:33.756
- Thank you,
good night, guys.

1:06:33.756 --> 1:06:37.160
- Bye.

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.462
- That was absurdly disgusting.

1:06:39.462 --> 1:06:40.867
- But I want
to see it again.

1:06:40.867 --> 1:06:41.064
- But I want
to see it again.

1:06:41.064 --> 1:06:42.632
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1:06:42.632 --> 1:06:44.801
- We'll see you later.
- Fantastic, thank you.

1:06:44.801 --> 1:06:45.969
- Bye.

1:06:45.969 --> 1:06:51.474
- ♪ Follow me

1:06:51.474 --> 1:06:54.577
- I want to show people that age
has nothing to do with it.

1:06:54.577 --> 1:06:56.913
You don't stop
because you got gray hair.

1:06:56.913 --> 1:06:59.215
- To be fair, Mel,
you're still singing.

1:07:01.551 --> 1:07:03.486
- I'm gonna kill you.

1:07:03.486 --> 1:07:05.455
- I love everything about you.

1:07:05.455 --> 1:07:07.323
I think you're
really special.

1:07:07.323 --> 1:07:08.491
I really do.

1:07:08.491 --> 1:07:10.293
Sorry, I've got to do this.

1:07:17.567 --> 1:07:18.902
- Walking in two minutes,
everyone.

1:07:18.902 --> 1:07:20.136
Two minutes, please.

1:07:20.136 --> 1:07:21.671
- Are you doing your own
makeup and hair?

1:07:21.671 --> 1:07:23.072
- Yeah.

1:07:23.072 --> 1:07:25.475
- You did that yourself?

1:07:25.475 --> 1:07:26.709
- What's that mean?

1:07:26.709 --> 1:07:28.645
- What--the whole--
did you do that yourself?

1:07:28.645 --> 1:07:31.447
- No, I had, like,
help putting it all together.

1:07:31.447 --> 1:07:33.182
- It looks like
you did it yourself.

1:07:34.884 --> 1:07:37.954
- I'm just getting
into the whole judging thing.

1:07:37.954 --> 1:07:40.690
- My extensive makeup
is in here.

1:07:40.690 --> 1:07:42.392
This doesn't just happen.

1:07:44.694 --> 1:07:44.831
It's a miracle
of modern technology.

1:07:44.831 --> 1:07:48.798
It's a miracle
of modern technology.

1:07:48.798 --> 1:07:51.000
I'm Julia Scotti,
I'm 63 years old.

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.669
I'm from Whiting, New Jersey.

1:07:52.669 --> 1:07:54.837
And I'm a comedian.

1:07:54.837 --> 1:07:57.473
- When did you get into comedy?

1:07:57.473 --> 1:07:58.741
- When I was about 28,

1:07:58.741 --> 1:08:01.110
I saw an ad
for an open mic night

1:08:01.110 --> 1:08:02.211
in New Jersey,

1:08:02.211 --> 1:08:05.281
at a Chinese restaurant,
of all places.

1:08:05.281 --> 1:08:08.484
I stopped doing comedy because
I needed something more stable.

1:08:08.484 --> 1:08:11.521
I was married, I had kids,
so I went back to college.

1:08:11.521 --> 1:08:14.824
I became a sixth grade
language arts teacher.

1:08:14.824 --> 1:08:14.831
But my love of comedy
never went away, ever.

1:08:14.831 --> 1:08:19.529
But my love of comedy
never went away, ever.

1:08:19.529 --> 1:08:20.930
- So, why here, why now?

1:08:20.930 --> 1:08:22.265
- Oh, why here, why now?

1:08:22.265 --> 1:08:24.100
You know, I've been doing
comedy all my life.

1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:26.102
I love it more than
anything else in the world.

1:08:26.102 --> 1:08:28.871
This is where I want to be.

1:08:28.871 --> 1:08:30.273
People tell you
when you're young,

1:08:30.273 --> 1:08:31.541
life goes by so quickly.

1:08:31.541 --> 1:08:33.476
Suddenly, you look around
and you're 63,

1:08:33.476 --> 1:08:35.578
and you're going,
I better get off the stick

1:08:35.578 --> 1:08:38.314
and start making
some stuff happen soon.

1:08:39.949 --> 1:08:41.417
And what am I gonna do?

1:08:41.417 --> 1:08:44.831
Go join the knitting club
or the bocce club?

1:08:44.831 --> 1:08:45.521
Go join the knitting club
or the bocce club?

1:08:45.521 --> 1:08:48.091
No, no, I want to do stuff.

1:08:48.091 --> 1:08:49.792
And that's why I'm here.

1:08:51.260 --> 1:08:52.462
- When am I up?

1:08:52.462 --> 1:08:54.163
- Next.
- I'm up next?

1:08:54.163 --> 1:08:55.498
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:08:55.498 --> 1:08:58.501
- Oh, uh, what do I do?

1:08:58.501 --> 1:08:59.969
- Are you ready
to go give it to them?

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:01.104
- In 90 seconds.

1:09:01.104 --> 1:09:02.538
- Let's get to it.
- Let's do it.

1:09:02.538 --> 1:09:04.173
- All right, come on.

1:09:04.173 --> 1:09:08.611
- When I leave here,
I want people to just go,

1:09:08.611 --> 1:09:11.481
"She was hot stuff."

1:09:16.352 --> 1:09:17.820
- Welcome to
"America's Got Talent."

1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:19.455
- Thank you, this is fantastic.

1:09:19.455 --> 1:09:20.823
- What's your name,
and where you from?

1:09:20.823 --> 1:09:23.526
- My name is Julia Scotti,
and I'm from New Jersey.

1:09:23.526 --> 1:09:25.762
- There you go.

1:09:25.762 --> 1:09:27.864
And what is it that you do?

1:09:27.864 --> 1:09:29.399
- I'm a stand-up comic.

1:09:29.399 --> 1:09:32.201
- Ah.

1:09:32.201 --> 1:09:35.171
Okay, so why
"America's Got Talent"?

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:37.874
- I want to show people that age
has gonna to do with it.

1:09:37.874 --> 1:09:41.010
You know, you don't stop
because you got gray hair.

1:09:41.010 --> 1:09:44.080
Right?

1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:44.831
- Well, I mean, Howie's 60,

1:09:44.831 --> 1:09:45.815
- Well, I mean, Howie's 60,

1:09:45.815 --> 1:09:48.184
and you still do stand-up,
don't you?

1:09:48.184 --> 1:09:51.054
- Well, it would be harder
if I had gray hair.

1:09:51.054 --> 1:09:53.756
I have no hair,
which gives me the ability.

1:09:53.756 --> 1:09:55.191
- It would be harder for me
if I had no hair.

1:09:55.191 --> 1:09:57.126
- And to be fair, Mel,
you're still singing.

1:09:57.126 --> 1:09:59.495
- You know what?

1:09:59.495 --> 1:10:01.497
I'm gonna kill you.

1:10:01.497 --> 1:10:03.700
- I meant it
as a compliment.

1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:06.002
- Okay, back to you.
- I admire you.

1:10:06.002 --> 1:10:08.137
- So, listen,
this is your stage.

1:10:08.137 --> 1:10:10.707
We're all standing
at your attention.

1:10:10.707 --> 1:10:12.075
Good luck, and enjoy yourself.

1:10:12.075 --> 1:10:14.043
And by the way, Simon,
you're dead meat.

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:18.781
- Thank you,
thank you for coming out.

1:10:18.781 --> 1:10:19.782
This is great.

1:10:19.782 --> 1:10:20.783
So I am old.

1:10:20.783 --> 1:10:22.952
I'm in the autumn of my years.

1:10:22.952 --> 1:10:26.456
It is, because my foliage
is starting to change color.

1:10:28.591 --> 1:10:29.692
- No.

1:10:29.692 --> 1:10:33.162
No, no, no.

1:10:33.162 --> 1:10:34.864
- If you know what I mean.

1:10:34.864 --> 1:10:36.566
- We know.
- We do.

1:10:37.900 --> 1:10:40.670
- I'm at this age where
if I were on a sinking ship

1:10:40.670 --> 1:10:43.106
and there weren't enough
lifeboats to go around, right,

1:10:43.106 --> 1:10:44.831
and I was getting the last seat
on the last boat,

1:10:44.831 --> 1:10:46.843
and I was getting the last seat
on the last boat,

1:10:46.843 --> 1:10:48.611
and just as I was about
to climb on board,

1:10:48.611 --> 1:10:51.147
this young girl comes up,
gives me the sad face,

1:10:51.147 --> 1:10:52.381
you know, like...

1:10:52.381 --> 1:10:54.617
Like I'm supposed to
change places with her.

1:10:54.617 --> 1:10:58.121
Seriously, I'm supposed to say
something noble like,

1:10:58.121 --> 1:11:03.092
"You know, dear,
I've had a good life.

1:11:03.092 --> 1:11:06.729
You take my seat
on the lifeboat."

1:11:06.729 --> 1:11:08.231
that!

1:11:17.340 --> 1:11:18.541
I didn't get to be this old

1:11:18.541 --> 1:11:22.578
by giving up my seat
on a lifeboat.

1:11:22.578 --> 1:11:27.016
You're gonna have to learn
to live with disappointment.

1:11:27.016 --> 1:11:28.918
At least for a couple
of more minutes.

1:11:28.918 --> 1:11:30.753
You know...

1:11:37.927 --> 1:11:40.329
So, in addition to being old,

1:11:40.329 --> 1:11:44.100
I'm fat, single, and broke.

1:11:44.100 --> 1:11:44.831
My 401, I got enough in there

1:11:44.831 --> 1:11:45.968
My 401, I got enough in there

1:11:45.968 --> 1:11:50.373
for about a month and a half
of Netflix.

1:11:50.373 --> 1:11:52.441
I'm a complete and utter
physical wreck.

1:11:52.441 --> 1:11:56.879
You know, my primary care doctor
is a paleontologist.

1:11:59.615 --> 1:12:02.585
I don't work out, because I got
the really bad arthritis.

1:12:02.585 --> 1:12:03.653
Not like my cousin.

1:12:03.653 --> 1:12:04.987
My cousin's 70 years old.

1:12:04.987 --> 1:12:08.958
She ran a marathon at 70,
26 1/2 miles.

1:12:09.959 --> 1:12:10.960
I know!

1:12:10.960 --> 1:12:12.094
Making me look bad.

1:12:12.094 --> 1:12:14.063
I smoke two packs
of cigarettes a day.

1:12:14.063 --> 1:12:14.831
I jog a block and a half.

1:12:14.831 --> 1:12:16.065
I jog a block and a half.

1:12:16.065 --> 1:12:17.700
I'm starting
to see dead relatives

1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:20.069
at the end of the street,
going...

1:12:25.074 --> 1:12:26.342
Thank you so much.

1:12:26.342 --> 1:12:27.944
Thank you, thank you.

1:12:31.948 --> 1:12:34.617
- She got 'em smiling
and on their feet.

1:12:35.818 --> 1:12:39.188
- Thank you.

1:12:39.188 --> 1:12:43.092
You're gonna make me cry!

1:12:43.092 --> 1:12:44.093
Thank you.

1:12:46.863 --> 1:12:48.631
Thank you so much.

1:12:48.631 --> 1:12:50.199
- Heidi, what did you think?

1:12:50.199 --> 1:12:52.034
- You're a little bit naughty,
and I love it.

1:12:52.034 --> 1:12:53.402
And I love
how you're yelling at us,

1:12:53.402 --> 1:12:56.105
and I love how comfortable
you are on the stage.

1:12:56.105 --> 1:12:57.907
You really made me laugh;
it was great.

1:12:57.907 --> 1:12:59.375
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:00.376
- I'm glad.

1:13:00.376 --> 1:13:02.712
- Julia, from one comic
to another,

1:13:02.712 --> 1:13:04.247
I'm gonna have Howie
tell you what he thought.

1:13:04.247 --> 1:13:05.281
- Oh, my God.

1:13:05.281 --> 1:13:08.251
You are a joy.

1:13:08.251 --> 1:13:09.952
You have so much to offer.

1:13:09.952 --> 1:13:11.320
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.831
- Why did you start
so late in life?

1:13:14.831 --> 1:13:16.392
- Why did you start
so late in life?

1:13:16.392 --> 1:13:19.762
- I was 28 when I started,
and I did it for 20 years,

1:13:19.762 --> 1:13:21.697
and then I took 11 years off.

1:13:21.697 --> 1:13:22.999
I became a teacher,

1:13:22.999 --> 1:13:24.967
and there was other issues.

1:13:24.967 --> 1:13:27.003
Do you want to know
what they were?

1:13:27.003 --> 1:13:29.972
- I would.

1:13:29.972 --> 1:13:31.874
- Well, for the first
28 years of my life,

1:13:31.874 --> 1:13:36.045
I was known as Rick Scotti.

1:13:36.045 --> 1:13:37.213
- Oh, no way.

1:13:37.213 --> 1:13:38.281
- Wow.

1:13:39.782 --> 1:13:41.684
- So this is big for me.

1:13:44.287 --> 1:13:44.831
- Well, you know,

1:13:44.831 --> 1:13:45.755
- Well, you know,

1:13:45.755 --> 1:13:48.291
whether you're a man
or whether you're a woman,

1:13:48.291 --> 1:13:50.593
you're human,
and you're funny.

1:13:50.593 --> 1:13:52.395
- Thank you.
- And you're talented.

1:13:52.395 --> 1:13:54.797
- Thank you.
- And you're brave.

1:13:54.797 --> 1:13:56.832
- And I'm so glad
we got to see you.

1:13:59.735 --> 1:14:00.836
- You know, you're funny.

1:14:00.836 --> 1:14:02.471
You're completely inappropriate,

1:14:02.471 --> 1:14:03.973
and you say
what everybody's thinking.

1:14:03.973 --> 1:14:05.041
- Thank you.

1:14:05.041 --> 1:14:06.242
- And you're my kind of girl.

1:14:06.242 --> 1:14:07.310
I loved it.

1:14:07.310 --> 1:14:11.080
Loved it, loved it, loved it.

1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:13.549
- Well, you are a piece
of work, Julia, aren't you?

1:14:13.549 --> 1:14:14.684
I mean, you know, like,

1:14:14.684 --> 1:14:14.831
the nice sort of
granny schoolteacher, all sweet,

1:14:14.831 --> 1:14:17.954
the nice sort of
granny schoolteacher, all sweet,

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:19.689
and then you go
into your routine.

1:14:19.689 --> 1:14:21.357
It was like, whoa.

1:14:21.357 --> 1:14:22.391
- Surprise.

1:14:22.391 --> 1:14:23.793
- I mean, talk about surprises.

1:14:23.793 --> 1:14:26.362
They're never-ending
with you, are they.

1:14:26.362 --> 1:14:27.863
But you know what, Julia,

1:14:27.863 --> 1:14:29.999
you genuinely made me laugh,

1:14:29.999 --> 1:14:32.268
because you were
really shocking.

1:14:32.268 --> 1:14:34.136
- You were the one
I was worried about.

1:14:34.136 --> 1:14:35.705
- No, I'm the pussycat, Julia.

1:14:35.705 --> 1:14:38.407
You're edgy,
and you're interesting.

1:14:38.407 --> 1:14:40.242
So congratulations,
great audition.

1:14:40.242 --> 1:14:43.679
- Thank you very, very much.

1:14:43.679 --> 1:14:44.831
- So let's vote--Howie?

1:14:44.831 --> 1:14:46.315
- So let's vote--Howie?

1:14:46.315 --> 1:14:48.384
- It's obvious, you're a yes.

1:14:48.384 --> 1:14:50.453
- Definite yes.

1:14:50.453 --> 1:14:53.322
- Obviously, sweetie,
it's a yes.

1:14:53.322 --> 1:14:55.925
- And you got your
fourth yes from me.

1:15:00.796 --> 1:15:01.998
- See you in the next round.

1:15:01.998 --> 1:15:03.866
Congratulations.

1:15:06.602 --> 1:15:07.670
- Ha!

1:15:07.670 --> 1:15:09.438
- Wow!

1:15:09.438 --> 1:15:10.639
- Thank you so much.

1:15:10.639 --> 1:15:11.841
Oh, my God,
that was amazing.

1:15:11.841 --> 1:15:12.942
- How does it feel?

1:15:12.942 --> 1:15:14.110
- Oh, my God,
it's like I want to go out

1:15:14.110 --> 1:15:14.831
and do another 45 minutes.

1:15:14.831 --> 1:15:15.311
and do another 45 minutes.

1:15:15.311 --> 1:15:17.146
- She's fantastic;
I loved her.

1:15:17.146 --> 1:15:18.681
- I love her too.
- She's great.

1:15:18.681 --> 1:15:20.383
- I got a standing ovation,

1:15:20.383 --> 1:15:23.819
and all four of them
voted to pass me.

1:15:23.819 --> 1:15:25.755
And I didn't have
a heart attack.

1:15:28.758 --> 1:15:30.159
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:15:30.159 --> 1:15:32.294
- What's your name?
- My name's Callie Bevilet.

1:15:32.294 --> 1:15:33.529
- What is your dream?

1:15:33.529 --> 1:15:36.298
- My dream is to win
"America's Got Talent."

1:15:50.279 --> 1:15:51.480
How many more do we have?

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.883
- One more, guys.
- What?

1:15:53.883 --> 1:15:55.484
- I mean, that's what I see.
- How many more?

1:15:55.484 --> 1:15:56.886
- This is it.
- There's one more.

1:15:56.886 --> 1:16:00.122
- We only have one more?
- Yeah.

1:16:00.122 --> 1:16:02.425
- I wouldn't be here
without you, Mom.

1:16:02.425 --> 1:16:04.060
- Oh, I love you, baby.

1:16:04.060 --> 1:16:06.062
- I love you too.

1:16:06.062 --> 1:16:08.998
- So you ready to go out there
and give it your all?

1:16:08.998 --> 1:16:09.999
- Yes.

1:16:09.999 --> 1:16:11.500
- All right, go get 'em.

1:16:18.774 --> 1:16:20.242
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:16:20.242 --> 1:16:22.778
- What's your name?
- My name's Callie Bevilet.

1:16:22.778 --> 1:16:24.847
- Hi, Callie,
and where you from?

1:16:24.847 --> 1:16:27.049
- I am from a really small town
in Ohio.

1:16:27.049 --> 1:16:28.684
It's called Grand Rapids.

1:16:28.684 --> 1:16:29.785
- And how old are you?

1:16:29.785 --> 1:16:30.786
- I'm 16 years old.

1:16:30.786 --> 1:16:32.888
- 16 years old.
- Yeah.

1:16:32.888 --> 1:16:34.957
- And what is your dream?

1:16:34.957 --> 1:16:38.694
- My dream is to win
"America's Got Talent."

1:16:38.694 --> 1:16:39.762
- As a singer?

1:16:39.762 --> 1:16:41.163
- As a singer, yes.

1:16:41.163 --> 1:16:42.665
- Who do you compare
yourself to?

1:16:42.665 --> 1:16:44.433
- I don't compare myself
to anyone.

1:16:44.433 --> 1:16:45.668
- That's good.

1:16:45.668 --> 1:16:46.869
As Simon always says,

1:16:46.869 --> 1:16:46.876
he looks for somebody
who's original,

1:16:46.876 --> 1:16:48.304
he looks for somebody
who's original,

1:16:48.304 --> 1:16:50.372
somebody who
we can hear something

1:16:50.372 --> 1:16:51.474
we've never heard before.

1:16:51.474 --> 1:16:52.775
Is that what
we're about to hear?

1:16:52.775 --> 1:16:54.009
- Hopefully, yes.

1:16:54.009 --> 1:16:55.010
- I hope so too.

1:16:55.010 --> 1:16:56.112
I like the whole look.

1:16:56.112 --> 1:16:57.446
It's like a little
Audrey Hepburn.

1:16:57.446 --> 1:16:59.048
- Oh, thank you.

1:16:59.048 --> 1:17:02.118
My hair wasn't really,
like, my choice.

1:17:02.118 --> 1:17:05.688
I'm a survivor
of stage 3 ovarian cancer.

1:17:05.688 --> 1:17:07.323
- No way.
- Yeah.

1:17:11.861 --> 1:17:15.064
- Last summer,
we were on vacation,

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:16.876
and my mom noticed
a lump in my stomach.

1:17:16.876 --> 1:17:18.200
and my mom noticed
a lump in my stomach.

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:20.336
- We took her in
to the doctor,

1:17:20.336 --> 1:17:22.304
and the doctor said,

1:17:22.304 --> 1:17:24.640
"Your child has cancer."

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:27.042
It's probably the worst--

1:17:27.042 --> 1:17:30.012
the worst things you can hear
as a parent.

1:17:30.012 --> 1:17:32.181
- They're words that
you just don't want to hear,

1:17:32.181 --> 1:17:34.083
and, yeah, definitely
took my breath away

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:37.119
when I heard that.

1:17:37.119 --> 1:17:39.722
I got chemo
over the whole summer.

1:17:39.722 --> 1:17:41.590
I remember I was, like,

1:17:41.590 --> 1:17:45.661
running my fingers
through my swoosh one day,

1:17:45.661 --> 1:17:46.876
and it just started
kind of like falling out.

1:17:46.876 --> 1:17:49.598
and it just started
kind of like falling out.

1:17:49.598 --> 1:17:53.702
That was definitely the day
that I think I cried the most.

1:17:53.702 --> 1:17:55.237
Yeah.

1:17:55.237 --> 1:17:56.639
- It was anything but normal

1:17:56.639 --> 1:17:58.974
for a teenager
to go through that.

1:17:58.974 --> 1:18:01.177
But she's a fighter.

1:18:01.177 --> 1:18:02.444
I'm so proud of you.

1:18:02.444 --> 1:18:03.879
I look at her and I think,

1:18:03.879 --> 1:18:06.048
"Oh, my gosh, you're so much
stronger than I am."

1:18:06.048 --> 1:18:08.317
You got this.

1:18:08.317 --> 1:18:10.819
- When I was sick
in my hospital bed,

1:18:10.819 --> 1:18:12.321
I always tried to be happy

1:18:12.321 --> 1:18:14.456
and look at the positive
side of things.

1:18:14.456 --> 1:18:16.458
I always had on my headphones,

1:18:16.458 --> 1:18:16.876
and I was always
listening to music.

1:18:16.876 --> 1:18:18.894
and I was always
listening to music.

1:18:18.894 --> 1:18:21.864
Songs can really help people
through any situation.

1:18:21.864 --> 1:18:24.366
- She loved music,
and she loved singing.

1:18:24.366 --> 1:18:28.304
There was something special
with her voice.

1:18:28.304 --> 1:18:32.575
- Singing makes me feel happy,
and that's pretty much--

1:18:32.575 --> 1:18:36.378
that's the one word that I can
really fit to singing.

1:18:36.378 --> 1:18:38.180
And on August 28th,

1:18:38.180 --> 1:18:40.149
they told me
I was in remission.

1:18:40.149 --> 1:18:43.152
I was definitely
one of the lucky ones.

1:18:43.152 --> 1:18:44.286
That kind of motivated me

1:18:44.286 --> 1:18:46.876
to want to do more
with singing.

1:18:46.876 --> 1:18:47.223
to want to do more
with singing.

1:18:47.223 --> 1:18:49.592
- You want to say, "I know
she'll pull through this."

1:18:49.592 --> 1:18:51.694
But in the back of your mind,
it's always,

1:18:51.694 --> 1:18:53.562
you're really just hoping,

1:18:53.562 --> 1:18:57.333
because there's always
that, "What if?"

1:18:57.333 --> 1:19:01.537
- My dreams are just to grow up
and finish high school.

1:19:01.537 --> 1:19:05.274
I'm only a sophomore right now.

1:19:05.274 --> 1:19:07.343
I'm here now, so, obviously,

1:19:07.343 --> 1:19:09.144
be positive
about what you have.

1:19:09.144 --> 1:19:11.080
Keep pushing,
and you keep trying,

1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:15.784
and never stop believing
in yourself.

1:19:15.784 --> 1:19:16.876
Kind of came here today
to show people

1:19:16.876 --> 1:19:17.720
Kind of came here today
to show people

1:19:17.720 --> 1:19:19.655
that no matter
what you've gone through,

1:19:19.655 --> 1:19:22.858
to keep chasing your dreams.

1:19:22.858 --> 1:19:26.161
- Well, what a great message.

1:19:26.161 --> 1:19:27.997
Wow, you're an inspiration,

1:19:27.997 --> 1:19:29.431
and we can't wait to hear you.

1:19:29.431 --> 1:19:31.533
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1:19:37.539 --> 1:19:39.575
- Can feel my heart
beating out of my chest.

1:19:39.575 --> 1:19:42.044
- It's gonna be okay.

through an obstacle

1:21:35.224 --> 1:21:37.626
far greater than anybody
much older than you

1:21:37.626 --> 1:21:39.695
could even imagine
going through.

1:21:39.695 --> 1:21:41.530
And then you come
to this point,

1:21:41.530 --> 1:21:42.664
and you make choices,

1:21:42.664 --> 1:21:45.000
and you made the choice
of singing that song,

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.435
and that's your fight song.

1:21:46.435 --> 1:21:46.876

1:21:54.243 --> 1:21:55.611

1:21:55.611 --> 1:21:57.946
Your tones and the way
that you fell off the note

1:21:57.946 --> 1:22:00.249
was just on point.

1:22:00.249 --> 1:22:02.217
Couldn't have gone any better
for you, I don't think.

1:22:02.217 --> 1:22:03.752
- Thank you.

1:22:03.752 --> 1:22:05.220
- You do have a beautiful voice,

1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:08.390
and I can't believe
that you're only 16 years old.

1:22:08.390 --> 1:22:09.458
I mean, it's incredible.

1:22:09.458 --> 1:22:10.459

Just--you know what?

1:22:18.500 --> 1:22:21.270
I just had this feeling
when you walked out.

1:22:21.270 --> 1:22:22.771
I can't explain it.

1:22:22.771 --> 1:22:28.143

the choice of song, your voice.

felt it.

1:22:42.524 --> 1:22:44.426
And I think that, look,
you were nervous.

1:22:44.426 --> 1:22:46.562
I could hear that.

1:22:46.562 --> 1:22:46.876
But, you know,
you get past this stage,
