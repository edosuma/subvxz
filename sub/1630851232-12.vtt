00:08.310 --> 00:11.230

the things we do, right?

But, really, living in London
has just been

00:13.140 --> 00:14.710
the absolute best, truly.

00:14.750 --> 00:16.320

Dr. Goodwin.

medical license in the UK.

a urologist.

recent employment.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.300
- Receptionist.
- Receptionist?

overly qualified.

so easily replace me

01:19.820 --> 01:21.820

the wisest of ideas.

a million reasons

a position for you,

She still spotting?

02:27.450 --> 02:28.800

02:28.840 --> 02:31.760

in the doghouse.

02:33.330 --> 02:35.500

covering for me, man.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.680
I got a few job interviews.
If she needs anything--

02:37.720 --> 02:39.420

some exit paperwork

03:28.380 --> 03:31.430

any forwarding information.

Somebody here must know
where she is, right?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.740
It's for official paperwork,
okay?

03:41.780 --> 03:45.750
You wouldn't be betraying any
trust or anything like that.

his spine and order head CT.

So you were looking for me.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.420
- Yes. Veronica placed me
in the oncology department.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.600
So I wanted to reach out
and connect.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.690

05:00.730 --> 05:02.690

very helpful with patients

05:02.740 --> 05:04.740
who are going through chemo
and radiation

05:04.780 --> 05:06.740

31:00.900 --> 31:03.770
Thank you. Here you go.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.300
But, you know,
things are gonna get better.

31:06.340 --> 31:08.520
Okay? I promise you.

31:10.950 --> 31:12.480
Come on, let's walk.

31:16.740 --> 31:18.920
- Let 'em through.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.830
[indistinct chatter]

31:32.280 --> 31:32.500
.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.330
- Hey.

31:34.370 --> 31:35.800
- Hey.

31:35.850 --> 31:38.020
- Do you mind?
- No.

31:38.070 --> 31:39.370
- Thank you.

31:40.850 --> 31:42.900
Yeah. Good old St. Joe's.

31:44.070 --> 31:47.030
They allow the unhoused
to hang out out back.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.300
I wish I could say
Erman's situation was okay,

31:49.340 --> 31:52.170
but at least
he's not in danger, you know?

31:54.430 --> 31:57.440
- That's good.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, it is.

32:01.830 --> 32:04.010
- Last year, um...

32:06.270 --> 32:09.190
I had a terrible call.

32:09.230 --> 32:10.930
Kid getting beaten.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.890
We're supposed to
compartmentalize.

32:15.930 --> 32:18.850
Anyway,
another call comes in.

32:18.890 --> 32:22.200
Garden-variety
street crazy causing a scene.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.380
I go to move her,

32:24.420 --> 32:26.510
but when I touch her,

32:26.550 --> 32:28.420
she freaks out.

32:28.470 --> 32:31.120
She fights back.
She's scared.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.990
And I'm doing
this hold we learn.

32:35.040 --> 32:39.960
It's what we're supposed to do
to minimize the danger.

32:40.430 --> 32:43.870
But this hold they teach us...

32:43.920 --> 32:47.010
it's so easy to just...

32:47.050 --> 32:49.050
crack their shoulder.

32:51.490 --> 32:53.320
And I did.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.930
She starts screaming.

32:57.840 --> 33:01.060
It was so messed up,

33:01.110 --> 33:03.110
'cause I didn't
feel sorry for her

33:03.150 --> 33:08.290
or regret or anything
like a decent human being.

33:08.330 --> 33:11.550
I fractured her shoulder
in three places,

33:11.600 --> 33:14.600
and all I felt was--

33:14.640 --> 33:16.990
- Angry.
- Yeah.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.210
- You know, people with PTSD,

33:21.260 --> 33:25.090
they often freeze out
the ones they love.

33:26.090 --> 33:29.010
It's like with you
and your wife...

33:29.050 --> 33:31.490
you pull back because
you're afraid if you don't,

33:31.530 --> 33:35.190
she's gonna see
that you're bad person.

33:35.230 --> 33:38.060
But that's not the truth.
You're not a bad person.

33:38.100 --> 33:41.100
You said it yourself.
You're doing your job.

33:41.150 --> 33:43.540
You're doing
what you're supposed to do.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.940
But officers
are not equipped to handle

33:47.980 --> 33:50.500
a mentally unstable person
who isn't committing a crime.

33:50.550 --> 33:53.640
That's not your job.
That's my job.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.860
That's a social worker's job.

33:55.900 --> 33:58.340
- What about the next time?

33:58.380 --> 34:01.170
- Well, I teach doctors
and nurses

34:01.210 --> 34:03.650
how to deescalate psychosis
all the time.

34:03.690 --> 34:07.090
I'd be more than happy
to teach you.

34:07.130 --> 34:09.570
- Everything I do
has to be sanctioned,

34:09.610 --> 34:14.220
approved by the committee,
union reps, training.

34:14.270 --> 34:19.360
There's no going rogue
even if it helps.

34:19.400 --> 34:23.150
- Well, then maybe I'll just
have to make it official.

34:23.190 --> 34:25.540
- Teach the whole NYPD?

34:25.580 --> 34:28.540
- Heck yeah. Why not?

34:28.590 --> 34:30.940
- That's crazy.

34:30.980 --> 34:33.590
- Okay. But we don't
use that word anymore.

34:33.630 --> 34:37.380
Bananas.
I will accept bananas.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.510
- All right.
- All right?

34:39.550 --> 34:42.560
- That's bananas.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.690
- How's that feel?

34:45.730 --> 34:49.480
- It's a world of difference.
You are legitimate then, eh?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.910
- On my better days.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.350
- Well, I'll wager
this is one of them.

34:54.390 --> 34:56.090
Thanks, Doc.
- Yeah.

34:57.530 --> 35:00.230
Hey, you know, I didn't even
get your first name.

35:00.270 --> 35:02.620
- Sid.
- Max.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.450
- Be good.

35:06.190 --> 35:08.020
- It's a bit smaller
than New Amsterdam,

35:08.060 --> 35:09.710
but at least it's outdoors.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.590
- No one would hire me.

35:16.630 --> 35:20.120
And I...just wanted
to feel useful.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.600
- I thought you said that
the interviews were going well.

35:25.640 --> 35:29.300
- Yeah, I did say that,
but I was lying to you.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.740
I was either overqualified
or underqualified

35:31.780 --> 35:36.090
or just the right qualified
with the wrong references.

35:36.130 --> 35:38.090
- Oh, you'll find
the right spot.

35:38.130 --> 35:39.310
I know you will.

35:39.350 --> 35:41.570
- That makes one of us.
How's your day?

35:41.620 --> 35:43.010
- It's not much better.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.310
- No?
- No.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.710
- Interviews no good?
- Quite the opposite.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.620
The candidates are remarkable,

35:47.670 --> 35:50.580
but they're just somehow
not quite enough.

35:50.620 --> 35:53.110
Every community
needs representation,

35:53.150 --> 35:56.110
and hiring one means
eliminating the other.

35:56.150 --> 35:58.630
So it looks like
whoever I hire,

35:58.680 --> 36:01.070
I'm gonna be letting down
some part of this place.

36:01.110 --> 36:03.420
- Hmm.
- Some part of myself.

36:03.460 --> 36:05.770
- Shame you can't just
hire another you.

36:05.810 --> 36:09.210
[punchy music]

36:09.250 --> 36:10.990
- Oh wait. That's brilliant.

36:11.040 --> 36:12.690
- What?
- Thank you.

36:12.730 --> 36:15.040
- Of course,
glad I could help?

36:16.260 --> 36:19.180
- Transport team
to unit 7 please.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.180
Transport team to unit 7.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.440
- Dr. Bloom?

36:24.480 --> 36:26.310
- Yeah, I'm right here.

36:26.360 --> 36:28.660
- Yeah. How did it go?

36:28.710 --> 36:30.710
- Okay. So there were
some complications

36:30.750 --> 36:33.230
with your procedure,
but Dr. Reynolds and his team--

36:33.280 --> 36:34.630
- I meant the game.

36:34.670 --> 36:36.670
Did we win?

36:36.710 --> 36:39.330
- Nico--
- Just lay it on me, Doc.

36:39.370 --> 36:40.500
- They got slaughtered.

36:40.540 --> 36:42.680
- Ah.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.550
- Total blowout.

36:45.550 --> 36:47.200
- And you wore the jersey.

36:47.250 --> 36:50.160
- Nico, I just told you
that you almost died

36:50.210 --> 36:51.820
and you're asking me
about a jersey.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.250
Why?

36:53.300 --> 36:55.040
- Because I'm a Knicks fan.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.470
- Because you're an addict.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.820
- [snorts]
- What?

36:58.870 --> 37:01.170
The very definition
of addiction

37:01.220 --> 37:02.610
is the compulsive engagement

37:02.650 --> 37:05.570
in rewarding stimuli
despite adverse consequences.

37:05.610 --> 37:07.610
Tell me, which part
doesn't apply to you?

37:07.660 --> 37:09.440
Your body is screaming at you

37:09.490 --> 37:12.230
that your engagement
with the Knicks isn't healthy

37:12.270 --> 37:14.710
and you're just not listening.

37:14.750 --> 37:16.710
I did wear the jersey, okay?

37:16.750 --> 37:20.150
But if I'm being honest,
I kind of wish I hadn't.

37:24.630 --> 37:28.810
- I need more calm in my life.
- Yeah. I'll say.

37:28.850 --> 37:32.640
- Less anticipation of failure.
- Exactly.

37:35.770 --> 37:38.730
- No more obsessing
over the Knicks.

37:41.430 --> 37:42.870
- Good.

37:45.170 --> 37:47.480
- Well, because baseball's
starting up spring training.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.870
- Nico, come on.

37:48.920 --> 37:51.830
- Let's go, Mets.
Let's go, Mets.

37:51.880 --> 37:53.620
- You best be kidding.
- I'm not kidding.

37:53.660 --> 37:55.620
I just heard
we got Max Scherzer.

37:55.660 --> 37:57.580
I think we'll make playoffs
this year.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.450
- You did wonders
for Willow today. Thank you.

37:59.490 --> 38:01.360
- And if we continue
our sessions together,

38:01.410 --> 38:05.320
I can help manage her pain
and her nausea as well.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.110
- But if you want to do more
and help more people,

38:08.150 --> 38:09.420
we have a way to do that.

38:09.460 --> 38:13.420
But Veronica can't know.

38:13.460 --> 38:15.730
Are you in?

38:15.770 --> 38:17.770
- Are you asking
the holistic doctor

38:17.820 --> 38:21.300
if she'll say yes to something
mysterious and unusual?

38:21.340 --> 38:25.170
- Welcome to the resistance.
Hmm.

38:34.350 --> 38:35.530
- What is this?

38:35.570 --> 38:37.310
- Pierogi Platter
from First Avenue Deli.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.490
- Flowers
from Sherene's Garden.

38:40.750 --> 38:43.620
- Who sent all this?

38:45.540 --> 38:48.320
[phone rings]

38:49.670 --> 38:51.370
- Hey Floyd. How'd it go?

38:51.410 --> 38:55.160
- All good. Yeah.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.380
Hey listen, when you get home
and Lyn thanks you

38:58.420 --> 39:02.820
for everything you got her,
just say you're welcome.

39:02.860 --> 39:05.690
- Okay. But wait,
I didn't get her anything.

39:05.730 --> 39:11.520
- You have a beautiful home,
Claude, a beautiful life.

39:12.740 --> 39:14.960
Just say you're welcome.
Yeah?

39:29.930 --> 39:32.850
- Spit it out, Zamaya.

39:32.890 --> 39:35.550
- I'm here about
a theoretical situation.

39:39.850 --> 39:41.420
- I'm listening.

39:41.460 --> 39:43.770
- What if a few friends
of another friend

39:43.810 --> 39:47.380
were worried about that friend
throwing their future away?

39:47.430 --> 39:49.390
But the friends that are
worried about the other friend

39:49.430 --> 39:50.910
are also worried
about their futures

39:50.950 --> 39:55.780
due to certain retribution?

39:55.830 --> 39:59.570
- Is she safe?

39:59.610 --> 40:02.270
Please. Is she okay?

40:18.590 --> 40:22.720
- As I met with you, Narin,
I thought this person

40:22.770 --> 40:26.420
really has something special
to offer our community.

40:27.640 --> 40:32.430
And when I met with you, Rahul,
I felt the same thing.

40:33.990 --> 40:36.740
And again, with you, Charmaine.

40:36.780 --> 40:40.440
This hospital's
second in command

40:40.480 --> 40:43.260
who might one day be
its medical director

40:43.310 --> 40:46.700
has to represent
our multidimensional community.

40:48.310 --> 40:50.530
So Charmaine, I'm hiring you.

40:50.580 --> 40:53.360
- Thank you.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.670
- And Narin, I'm hiring you.

40:55.710 --> 40:57.020
- Oh, that's wonderful.

40:57.060 --> 41:01.540
- And Rahul you're hired too.
- Thank God.

41:01.590 --> 41:04.330
- You're all hired.
Now, let's get to work.

41:04.370 --> 41:06.850
Shall we?
[laughter]

41:17.820 --> 41:21.560
[quiet folk music]

41:21.610 --> 41:23.610
- Oi, oi. Maxie.

41:23.650 --> 41:24.960
- Hey.
- All right?

41:25.000 --> 41:28.610
- Yeah.
- So I hope you don't mind,

41:28.660 --> 41:30.960
but, uh, I've told
a few mates about you.

41:31.010 --> 41:33.790
- Y-you have?
- Yeah, I know it's late,

41:33.840 --> 41:36.670
but all these fellas have
got appointments months away

41:36.710 --> 41:38.800
and they all need
to keep working.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.970
The thing is, we don't know
why you're doing this,

41:41.020 --> 41:42.760
but we don't care.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.070
- And they don't mind
my little clinic in the alley.

41:45.110 --> 41:47.590
- Well, you think they need
somewhere posh?

41:47.630 --> 41:51.120
They just need help.

41:52.070 --> 41:54.070
- That I can do.

41:55.900 --> 41:58.820
- So this is Ken.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

41:58.860 --> 42:00.470
- Matthew.
- Hey, pleasure.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.080
- Eric.
- Nice to meet you.

42:02.130 --> 42:04.480
- Dennis.
- How are you?

42:04.520 --> 42:06.040
- Yeah, we got time for this?
- Yeah, sure.

42:06.090 --> 42:07.440
- All right, sweet.
