01:09.861 --> 01:11.955
Germans.
Let's get them!

01:14.950 --> 01:16.827
Where are
the damn fighters going?

01:20.706 --> 01:22.208
They've gone chasing scalps,

01:22.291 --> 01:24.089
leaving us unprotected again.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.594
Damn those
glory-grabbing bastards!

01:26.670 --> 01:29.469
Bandits! Hundreds of them!
Six o'clock!

02:09.253 --> 02:11.473
Is there anything
left of our escort?

02:11.548 --> 02:12.640
Negative, boss.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.889
Damn it! Why don't
they worry about us?

02:15.677 --> 02:18.226
I can't believe this!
It never fails.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.004
Oh, no.
Stay with me.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.530
This is Bouncing Betty.
Engine three is out.

03:15.612 --> 03:17.785
We're falling back. Two,
you take lead position.

03:22.786 --> 03:23.878
Need the extinguisher.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.956
Hank!

03:34.673 --> 03:36.926
Mayday! Mayday!
Prepare to bail out.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.806
I repeat, prepare to bail...

04:36.902 --> 04:38.654
Red One to Red Two, come in.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.456
<i>Are you awake
over there, Lightning?</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:49.836
Yeah, yeah, sorry.
Boy, I need a nap!

04:50.207 --> 04:54.758
Well, look alive. Wouldn't
want you to miss this war.

04:55.754 --> 05:00.681
War is hell. What we're doing
is just boring as hell.

05:02.385 --> 05:05.639
Whoever she was, I hope she
was worth losing sleep over.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.309
Oh, trust me, she was worth it!

05:09.476 --> 05:11.399
<i>Junior.
Junior, you okay?</i>

05:11.478 --> 05:15.858
Fine as wine, Red One. The sky
is blue and my guns are hot.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.035
<i>Joker, you all right?</i>

05:19.110 --> 05:22.740
Nope. I feel like I'm flying
my grandfather's Buick.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.999
Coolant indicator's
all over the map.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.329
And to think I was as happy as a
church lady when I got this plane.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.798
All right, Red Four, you're done.
Take it on home.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.170
Come on now, Captain, this gauge
over here is a piece of crap.

05:37.587 --> 05:41.933
Captain, let me give it a looky
before you send him back.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.396
He's not trailing
any oil or water.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.362
Seems to me like he's
just got a bad indicator.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.578
Come on, Easy. Let
me fly, sir, please?

06:01.653 --> 06:03.826
You know it ain't gonna be
no fun without me.

06:07.117 --> 06:11.338
All right. Okay.
You stay on, Red Four.

06:11.413 --> 06:13.711
You stay on, but you keep
an eye on it, all right?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.963
Thank you, sweetheart.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.545
Just my luck I get stuck
with the flying wreck.

06:19.170 --> 06:23.300
Another P-40 from
Uncle Sam's junkyard.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.060
It looks like we
got a truck up there.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.770
It's got German markings.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.105
Junior, it's your turn.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.313
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

06:37.981 --> 06:40.985
Prepare to feel
the wrath of the Ray Gun.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.280
I'm on your wing, Junior!

06:47.240 --> 06:48.287
Come on.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.180
You see that?

07:04.424 --> 07:07.394
Congratulations, kid.
You killed yourself a truck.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.595
Whoo-hoo!

07:08.678 --> 07:10.646
We can go back victorious.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.731
Everybody, form up.
We're going home.

07:15.852 --> 07:16.819
Uh...

07:16.895 --> 07:20.650
Easy, I see something. It's a train!
Eleven o'clock.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.614
I don't think it's German.
I don't see any guns.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.946
Looks like they're
moving livestock to me.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.204
No. It's military.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.160
It's camouflaged.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.334
It could just be cows.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.460
You don't want to shoot up no
cows if you don't have to.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.917
Unless y'all
planning on a barbecue.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.502
Nobody sees any guns?

07:41.086 --> 07:42.929
I'm telling you, Easy,
that's a munitions train.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.256
And I bet it's
armed to the teeth.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.133
You grown-ups better think fast.
It's headed for that tunnel.

07:47.509 --> 07:51.184
All right. Only one way to find out.
Let's go get it.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.985
Wait. Easy,
we got to take it head-on,

07:57.060 --> 07:59.279
low, so their guns
can't hit us.

07:59.396 --> 08:03.572
It's my decision, Lightning.
Stay in formation.

08:21.793 --> 08:24.012
Looks like these
cows are armed.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.057
Come on.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.023
Stay in front of it!

08:36.265 --> 08:37.643
Die, you Nazi dogs!

08:42.605 --> 08:44.983
Dang! Those cows
just shot up my wing!

08:49.112 --> 08:50.284
No sweat. No sweat.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.296
If that train makes it into the
tunnel, they'll stop in there.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.464
Where's Lightning?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.965
<i>Where the hell
are you, Lightning?</i>

09:05.045 --> 09:07.298
Taking the train from the front,
like you should have done.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.438
Come on. Come on. Come on.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.772
Gotcha!

09:26.566 --> 09:28.068
Whoa! Shit!

09:34.991 --> 09:35.992
Whoa!

09:39.079 --> 09:40.171
Whoo!

09:41.414 --> 09:43.542
Nothing like a good old
Georgia ass-whupping.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.593
Just trying to keep
you boys inspired.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.545
<i>How's this headline
for inspiration?</i>

09:47.629 --> 09:50.849
"Negro Pilot Dies Because He's
Too Stupid To Follow Orders."

09:54.928 --> 09:56.726
Your plane looks like
it's been through a shredder.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.442
How are you going to
explain that to Coffee?

10:01.851 --> 10:05.276
By explaining to him that I'm
the one who blew up the train.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.884
You boys go on ahead.
I've spotted something.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.262
Lightning destroyed
another one.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.635
Look at that mess.
Look at that mess.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.138
I guess we'll be
working all night again.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.892
<i>It's been a long time
since you've seen your sweetheart.</i>

11:19.971 --> 11:22.690
<i>Too bad she's
dancing with someone new.</i>

11:22.765 --> 11:24.517
<i>This is Axis Mary coming to you</i>

11:24.601 --> 11:27.070
<i>from Berlin with
your favorite music.</i>

11:28.855 --> 11:31.074
<i>Never thought that you would be</i>

11:31.149 --> 11:33.993
<i>Standing here so close to me</i>

11:34.569 --> 11:39.120
<i>There's so much I feel
that I should say</i>

11:40.408 --> 11:44.208
<i>But words can wait</i>

11:44.287 --> 11:48.918
<i>Until some other day</i>

11:53.129 --> 11:56.724
How about one time you bring my
plane home without wrecking it?

11:56.799 --> 11:57.800
Good morning, Mr. Coffee.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.681
You keep tearing up
my planes like this,

11:59.761 --> 12:01.638
you're gonna be wearing
your balls for a necktie.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.769
See, I can't let you do that,
'cause I just saw a goddess

12:03.848 --> 12:05.566
who's gonna bear
my beautiful children.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.736
You're a clown, Lightning.
You need to grow up.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.187
We can't afford to
have any more planes

12:09.270 --> 12:11.068
taken off the line
with your stupid...

12:11.147 --> 12:12.740
What is this?
What did you do?

12:12.815 --> 12:14.442
Oh, man! Where did
that come from?

12:15.193 --> 12:16.945
What happened was...
Sticks!

12:17.028 --> 12:19.030
Come see what this
clown did to the plane.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.581
I can see what you're thinking.

12:22.992 --> 12:26.417
What the hell is this? Did
somebody throw a train at you?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.622
Coffee, I can see you're upset.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.338
Maybe we should talk
about this another time.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.680
Oh, we got a new recruit here!

12:43.846 --> 12:45.598
Hey there.
You lost, son?

12:46.349 --> 12:47.851
I was looking for Jimmy Wayans.

12:48.643 --> 12:51.738
Uh, Jimmy got shot down must've
been, what, two weeks ago?

12:51.813 --> 12:52.860
I believe so.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.488
Well, is Uly Douglas here?

12:55.566 --> 12:56.613
Uh-uh.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.287
Furball's dead, son.
Crashed on takeoff.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.490
You're just a bad-luck
Chuck, aren't you?

13:01.572 --> 13:04.200
Everybody you know ends up on
the wrong side of the dirt.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.621
Don't pay him no mind, boy.
My name's Smokey.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.627
This here's Neon,
this is Joker.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.549
Flight Officer
Maurice Wilson, sir!

13:13.209 --> 13:16.133
You can leave all that saluting, son.
You're home now.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.384
Seeing as how
everybody you know dead,

13:17.463 --> 13:18.589
you might as well bunk with us.

13:18.673 --> 13:19.674
Wait. Wait. Wait.

13:19.757 --> 13:22.601
Just don't bad luck us before
you get up in this Jeep now.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.429
Yes, sir.
I'm trying to live.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.889
Come on, Maurice.
Come on, boy.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.269
Come on, boy, get in there!

13:27.348 --> 13:28.600
Hold on.

13:28.683 --> 13:29.900
Come on, Maurice.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.774
Wait, you've got to back up.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.328
How'd it go up there, Ray?

13:46.951 --> 13:48.544
I'm telling you, Deacon.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.088
Lightning almost got himself
killed again today.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.258
He's one crazy pilot.

13:58.421 --> 14:01.470
I'm going to pray for him if we
ever get to see any real combat.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.976
Well, hey, I see you here
after every mission.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.649
I'm sure your
prayers are helping.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.192
Thanks, Deke.

14:24.822 --> 14:29.794
Black Jesus, we thank you for bringing
Red Squadron back home to us.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.676
Lightning's usual elegant work.

14:41.798 --> 14:45.723
Although I understand your plane
didn't fare any better than the train.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.270
Sir.

14:47.345 --> 14:49.723
That old Lightning don't
never have his brakes on.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.059
Questions, gentlemen.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.269
Does it really matter, sir?

14:55.353 --> 14:56.821
- Lights up.
- Here we go.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.317
What was your question?

15:01.150 --> 15:04.575
What we do, how well we
do it, does it matter?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.580
Strafing runs and
coastal patrols.

15:10.660 --> 15:14.415
They got us out here using
planes to mop floors, fellas.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.124
I don't normally
go in for loose talk,

15:16.207 --> 15:19.381
but we won't even be
doing that for long.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.800
Ain't that why Colonel
Bullard went stateside?

15:23.172 --> 15:26.267
The Colonel's business
stateside is above your grade.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.428
All due respect, sir,
but are they back there

15:28.511 --> 15:29.808
deciding if they
should shut us down?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.184
Just a rumor, Winky.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.358
You know this how?

15:34.517 --> 15:35.689
Pass it up.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.411
Read it, Easy.
Out loud.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.366
Go ahead, son.

15:53.703 --> 15:56.422
"The use of Negroes in the Army
Air Corps may yet be halted."

15:57.248 --> 16:00.468
"A report has been forwarded calling
the performance by Negro pilots"

16:00.543 --> 16:02.136
"unsatisfactory."

16:04.714 --> 16:07.092
"A plan to assign the Negroes
to routine convoy cover may be"

16:07.175 --> 16:08.973
"all that remains
for those who seem"

16:09.051 --> 16:11.019
"to have neither
the intelligence"

16:11.095 --> 16:14.565
"nor the proper reflexes
for such a complicated task"

16:14.640 --> 16:17.769
"as fighter pursuit.
The great Tuskegee..."

16:17.852 --> 16:20.150
"The great Tuskegee experiment"

16:20.229 --> 16:24.735
"to allow the Negro type
to fly airplanes has failed."

16:48.925 --> 16:50.927
And you all thought what?

16:51.886 --> 16:53.183
You'd sign up.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.390
You get shiny boots, a uniform,

16:55.473 --> 16:57.771
and that'd be the end
of 100 years of bigotry?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.273
You're colored men
in a white man's army.

17:00.353 --> 17:03.527
It's a miracle you're
flying fighters in Italy,

17:03.606 --> 17:06.576
and not mopping
latrines in Milwaukee!

17:07.151 --> 17:08.743
You want it straight?

17:08.819 --> 17:13.619
Yes, the old man's stateside,
fighting the good fight.

17:14.784 --> 17:15.955
And when he
comes through for us,

17:16.035 --> 17:19.881
we better be damn sure we're
ready to do the same for him.

17:19.955 --> 17:25.133
Any of you feel otherwise, any of
you want to wash yourselves out,

17:25.962 --> 17:27.589
well, Negro, please do so,

17:27.672 --> 17:29.720
and I'll have you on the
next thing smoking back home

17:29.799 --> 17:32.894
to make room for the men
who want to stand and fight.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.266
Get your head up, son.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.103
You're fighter pilots.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.280
Watch the rest of the film.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.278
Learn something.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.755
When we came under
your command, Colonel,

18:00.830 --> 18:04.460
you stated very clearly that
we would never find Negroes

18:04.542 --> 18:06.715
who could pass a pilot's exam,

18:06.794 --> 18:10.014
make it through flight school,
survive basic combat.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.933
A combat record which,
to this point...

18:13.009 --> 18:14.602
We've done all of that.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.226
To this point,
I don't believe your boys

18:17.305 --> 18:19.103
have scored
a single aerial kill.

18:19.181 --> 18:23.186
Because you have not assigned
us a single forward mission.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.067
It's damn hard to
shoot down the enemy

18:25.146 --> 18:27.274
100 miles behind
the front lines.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.529
As a matter of fact,
when will we be

18:29.609 --> 18:31.953
assigned to
bomber escorts, Colonel?

18:32.028 --> 18:35.407
There have been any number of
reports of poor discipline.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.493
Which is in every newspaper
and magazine in the country.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.249
We have enough
race troubles as it is

18:40.328 --> 18:43.707
without these sons of bitches in the
press throwing fuel on the fire.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.423
How an unofficial assessment
of the Tuskegee program

18:47.501 --> 18:50.300
made its way to
newspapers and magazines

18:50.379 --> 18:52.973
may be worthy of
its own hearing, sir.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.801
Colonel Tomlinson,
you've been supporting

18:54.884 --> 18:56.978
this experiment
from the beginning,

18:58.387 --> 19:01.391
but I'm afraid you're just gonna
have to suffer its failure.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.894
We're given
hand-me-down planes.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.447
Ordered to attack targets that
have already been bypassed.

19:08.522 --> 19:12.322
Fly patrols where the enemy
hasn't been seen for months.

19:12.401 --> 19:16.531
Now we've clone every lowdown,
dirty job you've handed us,

19:16.614 --> 19:20.039
hoping that we would just
limp along and go away.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.711
We will not go away.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.881
We have a right to
fight for our country,

19:25.956 --> 19:28.300
the same as
every other American.

19:28.376 --> 19:32.756
So you shut us down,
or you let us fly.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.933
<i>Soldier boy</i>

19:36.008 --> 19:40.605
<i>Oh, do you think about me,
soldier boy?</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:42.682
<i>How could you ever...</i>

19:44.558 --> 19:45.901
What?

19:45.976 --> 19:48.024
Don't give me that look.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.481
What the hell were you
doing up there today?

19:50.606 --> 19:54.782
Beating up on Hitler. Winning the war.
I got the train, didn't I?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.114
I love you like a brother, Joe.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.289
But you disobey
my orders again,

19:59.365 --> 20:00.457
I'm gonna have to write you up.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.664
For what?
For being right?

20:02.743 --> 20:03.710
I told you those
guns were there.

20:03.786 --> 20:04.787
You almost got yourself killed.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.372
No, I followed protocol.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.628
You went for the glory.
There's a difference.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.585
Now you may not need me to get
you through this thing alive,

20:10.668 --> 20:14.047
but Joker, Junior, the rest
of the squad just might.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.851
Okay. You're right,
I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.304
What you in such a
hurry for anyway?

20:21.804 --> 20:24.683
I saw a girl.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.518
The most beautiful
I have ever seen.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.320
Just can't let them
alone, can you?

20:30.855 --> 20:33.984
No more than you can
let that bottle alone.

20:35.276 --> 20:39.156
You got your way of getting
through the war, and I got mine.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.164
I wonder what your
pops'd say to that.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.413
We can just leave
him out of this.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.500
He's got you in a pressure cooker, man.
Graduating college at 20,

20:50.583 --> 20:53.006
4.0, and now a captain?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.678
Pushing yourself mighty
hard to please him.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.765
Didn't I just say we can
leave him out of this?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.433
All right.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.433
Besides, I drink 'cause I got
to bunk with your crazy self.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.641
You bunk with me 'cause I'm the
best pilot in the whole damn Army,

21:06.724 --> 21:08.601
and you're just hoping
you're gonna learn something.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.692
If I'm not mistaken,
I'm the flight leader,

21:11.771 --> 21:14.240
which would make you
my wingman.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.407
Smarter doesn't
make you better.

21:15.483 --> 21:16.985
Better at what? Busting
up Coffee's planes?

21:17.067 --> 21:18.444
Romancing the ladies, for one.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.029
Now if you're done whining,

21:20.112 --> 21:22.365
I have got a pass to do
that very thing right now.

21:22.490 --> 21:23.742
Lightning.
Can I ask you something?

21:23.824 --> 21:24.825
What?

21:24.909 --> 21:27.708
What's going to happen when you go
home and the women speak English,

21:27.787 --> 21:31.382
and they understand just how
full of bullshit you are?

21:33.334 --> 21:34.551
What's this?

21:34.627 --> 21:36.880
Something to celebrate you being
old enough to know better.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.063
Ha!

21:47.389 --> 21:49.642
<i>"Italian for Beginners"?</i>

21:50.267 --> 21:51.985
How many cartons of smokes
this set you back?

21:52.061 --> 21:53.108
A simple "thank you"
wouldn't hurt.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.440
And a "happy birthday"
would have been fine.

21:55.523 --> 21:56.866
Knowing you,
you're just tired of me

21:56.941 --> 21:58.443
embarrassing myself
in front of the signorinas.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.903
Yeah, that might be it.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.573
How you feel?

22:04.073 --> 22:06.667
A whole lot more
than one year older.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.752
Thank you.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.296
Happy birthday.

22:13.791 --> 22:14.917
It's tight.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.507
Pilots got you all hot and bothered.
Come on.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.309
Coffee!

22:26.262 --> 22:29.812
We got three planes, the
hydraulic pumps are shot.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.483
Two more got bad governors.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.938
Grab a piece of that tape
and put it over that hose.

22:38.732 --> 22:39.858
What are you doing, Lightning?

22:39.942 --> 22:41.660
What?
What did you say?

22:41.735 --> 22:42.782
Come on, Lightning.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.535
I need it back by nightfall!

22:45.614 --> 22:47.366
And ask if she's got a sister!

22:47.449 --> 22:49.417
Yeah, a blind one!

23:10.639 --> 23:12.391
I'm sorry to bother you.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.977
I flew around your
house this morning.

23:17.980 --> 23:18.981
Okay. Uh...

23:30.451 --> 23:31.873
Right, you...

23:31.952 --> 23:32.999
Si.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.251
That was me.
I'm Joe.

23:35.664 --> 23:36.665
Joe.
Yeah.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.459
<i>D'accordo.</i> Sofia.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.715
Sofia, right.
Nice to meet you.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.805
Thanks.
Mama.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.816
Little.
Joe Little.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.204
I hope I'm not
intruding, ma'am.

24:11.617 --> 24:12.960
Thank you.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.083
Ah!

24:21.877 --> 24:22.969
Ah!

24:31.095 --> 24:34.065
Hold on. I want to
ask you something.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.451
How?

24:46.527 --> 24:50.532
Oh, how? I got a Jeep. You
want to come for a drive?

24:50.656 --> 24:51.908
<i>Dove?</i>

24:53.784 --> 24:55.127
What's <i>dove?</i>

24:55.244 --> 24:56.416
Dove.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.756
Is that a yes?

25:04.920 --> 25:07.139
You want to bring your mother?

25:08.924 --> 25:11.302
It's going to be
tougher than I thought.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.204
What you going with?
I got two pair.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.073
And three of clubs.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.830
I don't care what you have,

25:34.908 --> 25:36.285
you'll never be
able to beat me, son.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.787
You ain't got
enough in the head.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.248
I can't lose. I don't
even know why y'all try.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.880
You just got here, Maurice. I
hope you're learning something.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.427
Hope at least
you're learning by now

25:45.502 --> 25:47.095
not to play poker
with people that cheat.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.388
I ain't cheating.

25:48.881 --> 25:49.928
You cheat.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.975
I don't want to learn
how to play cards,

25:52.051 --> 25:53.974
I want to learn
about combat flying.

25:54.053 --> 25:57.353
Dogfights and tricks for
switching it up on them Jerries.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.189
What the hell you think it is
we know about dogfighting?

26:01.268 --> 26:02.690
The white boys are
the only ones get to

26:02.770 --> 26:04.772
tangle it up with
the Jerries around here.

26:04.855 --> 26:06.857
But they don't
talk to us much, so...

26:06.940 --> 26:11.867
Experience is a cruel teacher. She
gives the exam first, then the lesson.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.288
You know what?

26:13.363 --> 26:14.580
I decided when I get home...

26:14.656 --> 26:15.748
Yeah.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.292
...people ask me
about the war,

26:17.367 --> 26:18.789
I'm going to
just make stuff up.

26:21.121 --> 26:25.797
Hell, I already do! Ask me what I
killed, seven trucks, five Jeeps,

26:25.876 --> 26:29.255
and one of those motorcycles
with the sidecar on them.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.512
My record look like the inventory
down at the motor pool.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.843
How the hell am I
gonna go back home

26:33.926 --> 26:36.054
and tell my dad all I
killed were traffic?

26:36.136 --> 26:38.355
He'll whup my ass!

26:39.139 --> 26:40.186
What's that?

26:40.265 --> 26:42.609
It's my Buck Rogers
X-38 disintegrator pistol.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.946
Makes me feel like...
You know,

26:47.106 --> 26:48.699
like I can't lose.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.234
Here, try it.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.035
No. No, thanks, Junior.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.580
I don't really like to fool with
other people's good luck charms.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.205
What's the matter?

26:58.659 --> 27:00.206
Nothing. Um...

27:01.620 --> 27:05.295
Look, I don't like
being called Junior.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.968
I want the tag Ray Gun.
I'm not a kid.

27:08.043 --> 27:12.549
I did two years at Howard before I
even enrolled in the Tuskegee program.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.847
I'm going to be an engineer.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.766
What about you?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.807
My dad's a judge.

27:22.683 --> 27:25.106
He wants me to
go to law school,

27:25.185 --> 27:26.402
so I guess I'm gonna do that.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.650
You ought to just give it up!

27:27.729 --> 27:29.106
Go back to where you came from.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.736
I'd rather be up there
killing Jerries

27:30.816 --> 27:33.160
than down here playing
games with you, Joker.

27:33.235 --> 27:37.035
Look, don't be in a hurry to
get to the killing part, Maurice.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.912
Tell me something.
You scared of dying?

27:42.411 --> 27:44.129
I don't know.

27:45.497 --> 27:46.794
I am.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.758
Every time I close
the lid on that canopy,

27:51.837 --> 27:54.761
I feel like I'm shutting
the lid on my own coffin.

27:56.425 --> 28:00.350
I tell you something else, the pilot that
tells you otherwise is either a liar

28:01.221 --> 28:03.690
or too foolish to
know any better.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.059
Amen.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.112
It's useless.

28:09.188 --> 28:12.488
All this talk for another
study, another inquiry.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.986
"Politics is
the art of..."

28:15.777 --> 28:19.156
Major Kessel's political science
class, the quote that he used...

28:19.239 --> 28:23.369
He said, "Politics is the art of
postponing a decision until it is..."

28:23.452 --> 28:25.580
"No longer relevant."

28:28.248 --> 28:30.751
Colonel
Mortamus stumbled badly.

28:30.834 --> 28:33.178
If he hadn't
embarrassed the brass

28:33.253 --> 28:35.722
by leaking that report
to the press,

28:35.797 --> 28:38.016
they probably would have
let you wither and die.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.640
His politicking
bought you time.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.764
For what?

28:44.556 --> 28:46.604
Operation Shingle.

28:46.683 --> 28:48.685
Air cover for a beach landing.

28:48.769 --> 28:52.148
It's your chance to go up
against German fighters.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.984
I'll say this, Jack.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.870
Even when your hope is
false, it sure is grand.

28:59.571 --> 29:03.246
I'm serious, A.J.
I can get that for you.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.628
If you stick your
neck out how far?

29:09.665 --> 29:12.168
I don't want you to put your
career on the line for me, Jack.

29:13.085 --> 29:17.261
A little less tin on my
uniform is the least of it.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.762
If I get you the mission,

29:19.841 --> 29:21.639
your men have got to
put something on the board.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.766
They come through,
or Mortamus and the brass

29:23.845 --> 29:27.850
will have all they need
to shut the whole thing down.

29:28.850 --> 29:31.399
You get us that mission,

29:31.478 --> 29:33.606
we will light up the board.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.614
Has this flight order
been verified?

29:42.698 --> 29:45.201
Yes, sir. It came directly
from Colonel Bullard in Washington.

29:47.119 --> 29:50.123
Check it again. Get the
flight leaders together.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.752
Sir.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.845
The Colonel got us an opportunity.
Gather around, gentlemen.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.797
Attacking another train, sir?

29:58.880 --> 30:03.431
Or did we graduate to minding
a truck convoy this time?

30:03.510 --> 30:05.387
Operation Shingle.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.606
It's an ambitious
landing off the coast

30:08.682 --> 30:10.309
of the Tyrrhenian Sea
at Nettuno.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.022
We've been given the frag order

30:15.105 --> 30:16.482
to provide air cover
for the landing.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.024
Yeah!

30:18.191 --> 30:19.317
Whoo!

30:20.527 --> 30:22.825
I'm gonna have so many of those
little swastikas on my plane,

30:22.904 --> 30:24.451
they're gonna think
it's camouflage.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.659
We will repay the old man
with victory, hear me?

30:27.743 --> 30:28.744
Yes, sir!

30:28.827 --> 30:32.206
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.

30:32.289 --> 30:33.962
Good luck, gentlemen.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.513
Junior, where you at, boy?
You're gonna miss the flight.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.603
<i>I know I'm late.
I'm coming.</i>

30:50.682 --> 30:53.561
We're a long way from Memphis,
but Black Jesus is here with me,

30:53.643 --> 30:55.862
and he says it's gonna
be a successful mission.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.190
Now does that mean we're gonna
shoot down a bunch of Jerries,

30:58.273 --> 30:59.946
or we gonna come back
in one piece,

31:00.025 --> 31:02.869
or Lightning gonna pick up
some girls along the way?

31:03.612 --> 31:08.288
No more pickups for me, boys.
I swear to you, lam in love.

31:08.909 --> 31:12.254
Love? Swearing? Both
bad luck in my book.

31:15.832 --> 31:19.086
<i>I can't believe I made it.
Don't tell Easy I was late.</i>

31:25.300 --> 31:26.392
They all set?

31:26.468 --> 31:27.469
All ready, sir!

31:27.928 --> 31:28.975
Send them off.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.210
Hallelujah. The saints
are marching in!

32:12.139 --> 32:14.062
Watch me become
an ace today, boys.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.438
Lightning, did you
just say you're gonna

32:15.517 --> 32:17.110
become an ass today, or an ace?

32:17.185 --> 32:18.482
I couldn't quite
hear what you...

32:18.562 --> 32:21.190
<i>Was it ass or ace?
I couldn't hear.</i>

32:21.273 --> 32:23.150
I think you heard
him right, Smokey.

32:23.650 --> 32:26.449
All right, men,
cut the chatter.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.709
Jesus.
Would you look at that!

32:44.671 --> 32:47.891
Oh, my goodness.
Just like in the newsreels.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.450
Keep your eyes peeled
for the Jerries.

33:24.419 --> 33:25.887
Bogies inbound, twelve o'clock.

33:25.962 --> 33:27.760
And they're
closing in mighty fast!

33:31.718 --> 33:34.312
These pilots are rookies!
Make quick work of them.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.517
All planes, hold formation.

33:47.067 --> 33:48.068
Hold on.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.153
Come on, come on, come on.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.539
Anytime, Red One.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.498
Drop tanks!

34:07.462 --> 34:09.089
Oh, shit!

34:10.465 --> 34:12.592
<i>I'm shaking them!
There's two more!</i>

34:12.676 --> 34:14.098
Yes. They're cutting left!

34:14.803 --> 34:17.226
<i>Put a
little hitch in his giddyup!</i>

34:17.304 --> 34:18.351
<i>I'm feeling good now!</i>

34:18.431 --> 34:19.853
<i>Remember,
keep the beachhead clear.</i>

34:19.933 --> 34:21.560
<i>It's clear.</i>

34:21.643 --> 34:24.192
<i>Straighten up
over there, Junior.</i>

34:25.272 --> 34:26.899
Let's go, Lightning.
I'm on one.

34:26.982 --> 34:29.076
<i>I'm behind you. Break right!</i>

34:29.150 --> 34:30.402
I got him.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.658
Get on the inside, Easy!
Get on the inside.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.382
Come on, slip just a little.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.255
Come on, tighter, tighter.

34:58.471 --> 34:59.518
Congratulations, Captain.

34:59.598 --> 35:03.023
You are the first Negro to
shoot down a Jerry! Whoo!

35:03.476 --> 35:04.523
Ha-ha!

35:07.147 --> 35:09.195
Junior!
Straight ahead now.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.823
There's my swastika.

35:11.901 --> 35:13.699
I'm on your wing.

35:18.325 --> 35:20.077
Come on, baby, just move
a little bit closer.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.457
All I want is
a little bitty kiss.

35:21.536 --> 35:24.255
Just give me a little
peck on the cheek. Yeah!

35:26.666 --> 35:28.088
Good shot.

35:37.052 --> 35:38.349
Oh, hell.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.191
Joker, there's one on my tail!

35:47.270 --> 35:51.275
Okay, listen, Junior. Buttonhook
right, and I'm gonna go left.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.075
Come on.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.496
No touchdown for
you today, Fritz.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.553
Junior, you're
all clear, buddy.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.468
Deke, on your right!

36:19.135 --> 36:20.182
I see him.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.066
Let's give those newspapers
something to write about.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.698
Tennessee says hello!

36:46.913 --> 36:49.132
There's the squad leader.
I'm gonna take him out.

36:51.584 --> 36:52.631
Careful. He's good.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.178
You're letting him
get away, Lightning!

36:58.258 --> 36:59.851
I'm just toying with him.

37:00.093 --> 37:02.767
This is for you, Pretty Boy,
with your bright yellow nose!

37:03.221 --> 37:05.144
Come on, boy. Line it up.
One shot.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.150
Holy crap!

37:17.527 --> 37:18.744
How'd he do that?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.163
<i>Get him off me!</i>
I'm on him.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.239
<i>Get him off me!</i>

37:21.322 --> 37:22.619
Get out of the way, Lightning!

37:22.699 --> 37:24.622
Open your throttle.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.248
Come on, man!
Take him out!

37:29.330 --> 37:31.879
<i>I can't get a clear shot.
Hold on.</i>

37:33.668 --> 37:34.760
Drop to your right.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.391
All right! I got him.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.060
Oh! Thank you, Lord.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.773
And there I was thinking
you didn't love me any more.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.600
He's headed home to mama.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.321
You thinking what I'm thinking?

37:54.397 --> 37:55.819
<i>If you're thinking
I should finish him off</i>

37:55.899 --> 37:58.448
<i>so we can get back to the
beachhead, then, yes.</i>

37:58.526 --> 38:00.369
Or we could follow him.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.197
We could go
after their airdrome.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.497
I don't know, Lightning. We got orders.
You know that.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.170
Come on, Easy. I'm talking
about a Jerry airbase.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.964
Dozens of planes!
You're saying no?

38:12.707 --> 38:15.335
All right. I'll trust
your instincts this time.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.671
But we're running low on fuel. We're
gonna follow for five minutes.

38:17.754 --> 38:19.848
You got that?
Five minutes.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.351
Joker, you back there?

38:25.053 --> 38:26.726
We're still back here.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.481
Junior?

38:28.556 --> 38:30.229
I'm ready for a turkey shoot.

38:42.111 --> 38:44.955
Mayday! Mayday!

38:56.125 --> 38:59.254
There it is, boys.
Get your scorecards ready.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.620
Gotta knock out those fighters
before they take off.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.502
Got to take
those guns out first.

39:51.639 --> 39:52.765
Everybody, form up.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.820
Here we go!

39:58.646 --> 40:00.023
Brand-new 109s.

40:14.162 --> 40:16.130
Not so brand-new 109s.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.168
Like ducks in a row.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.029
All right.
Two at once!

40:48.029 --> 40:50.157
That's nothing. Watch
me get four this time.

41:22.563 --> 41:23.735
Touchdown!

41:23.815 --> 41:24.941
<i>We're running low on fuel.</i>

41:25.024 --> 41:27.322
No time for celebration.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.166
Whoo!

41:34.242 --> 41:36.370
The Ray Gun strikes again.

41:36.452 --> 41:38.125
Junior, watch out
for that flak!

41:51.634 --> 41:52.681
Good job, Lightning.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.523
<i>Washington brass won't
be able to ignore this.</i>

42:24.542 --> 42:26.465
My God!
Those pilots are African!

42:30.006 --> 42:31.929
Hey! What happened to Junior?

42:32.008 --> 42:33.225
There he is.

42:33.301 --> 42:35.724
Three o'clock high.
He's trailing oil.

42:36.137 --> 42:38.435
Red One to Red Three.
Junior, come in.

42:39.932 --> 42:42.401
I took something in the leg.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.320
Something in my head.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.945
Level off, Junior,
or you're gonna stall out.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.993
All right.

43:19.514 --> 43:20.811
Oh, yeah!

43:30.525 --> 43:31.651
Yeah!

43:32.276 --> 43:33.528
Yeah!

43:36.197 --> 43:37.289
Yes!

43:57.260 --> 43:58.352
Whoa!

43:59.804 --> 44:01.898
They done shot down the whole
Luftwaffe, didn't they?

44:02.640 --> 44:05.143
Yes, they did, huh?
Those hotshots sure did.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.489
Never doubted it.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.822
Did I make it?

44:18.906 --> 44:21.955
Yeah, you made it, damn Knucklehead.
Should have let you crash.

44:22.034 --> 44:23.581
You'll be okay.

44:26.706 --> 44:28.583
No surprises, Ray Gun.
You get healthy, all right?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.760
Luck is with you, Ray!

44:39.427 --> 44:43.523
I think we can cautiously
declare the landing a victory.

44:43.598 --> 44:46.477
It's a slog, but the
ground troops are holding.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.232
Colonel Bullard.

44:48.603 --> 44:49.820
Sir.

44:49.896 --> 44:52.149
Your boys chalked
eight kills in the air,

44:52.231 --> 44:54.450
63 aircraft destroyed
on the ground.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.198
No losses in their first wave.

44:56.277 --> 44:59.156
Outstanding. Pass along
my congratulations.

44:59.238 --> 45:01.115
Thank you, sir.

45:01.532 --> 45:04.206
Action reports and
assessments by 1500.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.292
Colonel.

45:12.168 --> 45:15.468
Eight German fighters
or 80 German fighters,

45:15.546 --> 45:18.470
it still doesn't change what I
think of you and your boys.

45:19.508 --> 45:21.636
We don't care.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.182
Respect the uniform.

45:28.893 --> 45:32.318
Believe me, sir, that is
all I have respect for.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.700
It's not as bad as all this.

45:43.783 --> 45:47.629
Leg's good, eye's fine.
In a week's time,

45:47.703 --> 45:51.674
I'll be able to see fine out of one
eye and mostly out of the other.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.841
"Mostly."

45:54.293 --> 45:56.216
Is that what you
want me to tell Stance?

45:56.295 --> 45:58.548
"Sir, Ray Gun has one-and-a-half
eyes' worth of ability."

46:00.883 --> 46:03.853
Look, come on.
I landed a plane blind.

46:04.387 --> 46:05.434
Lightning...

46:05.513 --> 46:07.436
Hey, don't get me in this.

46:08.391 --> 46:10.439
If the Flight Surgeon
won't clean bill you,

46:10.518 --> 46:12.236
what do you expect me to do?

46:12.645 --> 46:15.945
Just talk to him.
He listens to you.

46:17.358 --> 46:20.157
I mean,
you got the same respect

46:20.236 --> 46:23.035
on this base
as the old man, so...

46:34.292 --> 46:36.920
I'd rather be dead
than on the ground.

46:39.088 --> 46:41.557
Easy, you're
the best friend I got.

46:41.632 --> 46:44.351
Please don't do this to me.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.139
General Luntz, Colonel Bullard.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.065
Thank you, Lieutenant.

46:55.646 --> 46:57.569
Colonel, please.
Thank you.

46:58.858 --> 47:00.701
No, thank you, sir.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.163
Colonel, I'm in a hell of a fix
with our target in Europe.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.912
Our boys are
getting cut to shreds.

47:08.326 --> 47:11.546
I read the action report
from Operation Shingle.

47:13.372 --> 47:17.673
Eight kills in your first wave.
Thirteen in ail.

47:18.210 --> 47:19.757
That's a right trick.

47:20.629 --> 47:23.849
Colonel, I'll give
it to you straight.

47:23.924 --> 47:25.392
I can't afford
the kind of losses

47:25.468 --> 47:26.890
my bombers have been suffering.

47:26.969 --> 47:28.516
Do you have film
of the air cover

47:28.596 --> 47:30.644
your bombers are
getting now, sir?

47:34.602 --> 47:36.730
We need to change
the way we fight.

47:37.855 --> 47:42.611
I need pilots who will fly close and
tight to the heavies all the way.

47:43.861 --> 47:46.580
Not put my men in harm's way
by chasing rabbits.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.373
So you're asking me
to tell my men

47:48.449 --> 47:50.543
not to shoot down
Jerry fighters?

47:50.618 --> 47:54.213
I'm asking them to put the
bombers ahead of themselves.

47:54.288 --> 47:57.508
I don't care if they never
splash another Jerry fighter.

47:57.583 --> 48:00.211
I need to get my heavies
to the target and back.

48:00.294 --> 48:03.719
The losses from enemy air, I believe
my men can get that down, sir.

48:05.049 --> 48:08.553
If you can bring back one or two
more of my planes every mission...

48:08.636 --> 48:13.142
Sir, I believe we can cut
your losses by 70% or 80%.

48:14.475 --> 48:16.443
Colonel, the word is
you're arrogant.

48:17.478 --> 48:21.699
If "arrogant" is the only word
people use to describe me now,

48:21.774 --> 48:25.369
I would say I think
I'm making progress.

48:38.165 --> 48:40.793
Can you help us?
I'm asking you man to man.

48:41.168 --> 48:43.421
Can you help save lives?

48:43.504 --> 48:47.680
We need new planes.
No more hand-me-downs.

48:48.926 --> 48:51.475
If you get us new planes,

48:51.554 --> 48:53.431
we can help your boys.

48:57.810 --> 49:01.781
I got a bullet right through my canopy.
I ought to be dead, y'all.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.358
But nothing
happened to me though.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.909
It's Black Jesus,
I'm telling you.

49:04.984 --> 49:07.863
Oh, go on with that.
Let's play.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.198
Don't sass Black Jesus, now
you might need him one day.

49:10.281 --> 49:13.410
What happened to you is luck.
Just luck.

49:13.492 --> 49:15.494
Lords of Poker,

49:15.578 --> 49:17.797
Black Jesus, White Jesus,

49:17.872 --> 49:20.341
Tooth Fairy, Easter
Bunny, all of them!

49:20.416 --> 49:23.636
I done lost all my damn money.
Something is wrong.

49:23.711 --> 49:24.758
Ain't that right.

49:24.837 --> 49:27.966
How about you just get wise?

49:28.048 --> 49:30.301
There is no special
mojo running the world.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.352
Things just are how they are.

49:32.428 --> 49:33.645
Us getting shot up

49:33.721 --> 49:35.815
and the people we're protecting
not caring a thing for it.

49:35.890 --> 49:37.767
I hear that.

49:37.850 --> 49:40.524
You talk real tough, Joe Little.
Real cold.

49:40.603 --> 49:42.230
Well, reality's
a little chilly.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.735
Is that right?
Let's play!

49:43.814 --> 49:46.658
Let me tell you about
this cold, hard brother.

49:46.734 --> 49:48.907
While y'all trying to get by with
your whiskey and cigarettes,

49:48.986 --> 49:50.158
guess what he's
doing with his rations?

49:50.237 --> 49:51.454
- What's that?
- What he doing?

49:51.530 --> 49:53.658
Trading them all for lingerie
to spoil his old lady.

49:53.741 --> 49:54.867
Oh, really?

49:54.950 --> 49:56.623
Perfume, silks.
Aw!

49:56.702 --> 49:58.796
That tease!

49:58.871 --> 50:02.717
Yeah, well, lucky at love
and lucky at cards.

50:03.459 --> 50:06.087
Right like that. Boom!

50:28.609 --> 50:33.080
Man, you are so beautiful.

50:37.034 --> 50:40.629
Of course, you have no
idea what I'm saying.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.496
I love you.

51:23.622 --> 51:24.669
Oh, uh...

51:26.292 --> 51:27.794
Wow, that's...

51:29.336 --> 51:30.428
Uh...

51:32.506 --> 51:33.553
Uh...
Shh!

52:02.119 --> 52:04.713
What are you doing here?
This is an officers' club.

52:05.581 --> 52:07.128
I am an officer.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.507
This is a whites-only
officers' club.

52:11.712 --> 52:14.591
You're off
the reservation, pal.

52:15.758 --> 52:18.932
Try the Italian dance hall
near the main plaza.

52:19.553 --> 52:22.727
Hey. Go home, nigger.

52:24.183 --> 52:26.606
I got what I came for.
Good night.

52:57.174 --> 52:59.597
Am I going
to be court-martialed?

53:01.804 --> 53:03.272
I don't know.

53:03.764 --> 53:05.482
I'm sure you trying to start a
race riot won't help you...

53:05.557 --> 53:07.400
I was finishing
what they started!

53:08.102 --> 53:09.479
Wrong or right,
we got regs to live by.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.438
And you throwing punches,
busting them up, gets you what?

53:11.522 --> 53:14.321
A good feeling, Easy.
Right here.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.153
A throb that says I didn't choke
on what they were feeding me.

53:17.277 --> 53:19.325
How do your heart feel? You say
"they" like it's all of them.

53:19.405 --> 53:22.284
Same as always. "Shuffle
along, cause no strife.

53:22.366 --> 53:25.586
"Don't scare the ofays
by speaking out."

53:28.747 --> 53:29.919
Some other time I'd have stood

53:30.040 --> 53:31.212
with you, side by side.
"Some other time"!

53:31.291 --> 53:33.919
But you put a minute's worth of
righteousness ahead of a whole war!

53:34.461 --> 53:35.508
Ugh!

53:35.587 --> 53:37.089
Same old Joe Little.

53:37.798 --> 53:39.892
Still getting into the wrong
fights for the wrong reasons.

53:39.967 --> 53:42.095
Your reasons any better?

53:45.973 --> 53:49.398
You spent your whole life being one
big, lousy Atlanta Compromise.

53:49.476 --> 53:52.855
Well, go sell that somewhere else.
I'm not buying it.

54:40.652 --> 54:42.279
I've come bearing gifts.

54:42.362 --> 54:44.035
I'm all ears, sir.

54:44.615 --> 54:46.709
Bomber escort
New P-51 s.

54:47.409 --> 54:49.912
You did it.
You really did it, sir.

54:49.995 --> 54:51.247
Come on. Let's get some food.
I'm hungry.

54:51.330 --> 54:52.547
Welcome home, Colonel.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.905
Lieutenant Little
. What am I going to do with you?

55:26.782 --> 55:29.285
Everything's a fight, isn't it?

55:29.368 --> 55:33.418
It must be so goddamn
exhausting being you.

55:35.874 --> 55:38.172
You know something, Joe Little?

55:38.919 --> 55:40.421
You're a punk.

55:44.716 --> 55:46.309
You remind me

55:48.053 --> 55:50.772
of one of those kids
from a comic strip,

55:52.099 --> 55:53.646
walking around,

55:55.227 --> 55:57.525
pushing his sleeve up one arm,

55:58.647 --> 56:00.775
hand balled in a tight fist,

56:02.818 --> 56:06.288
walking and looking at the
world through a squint.

56:07.614 --> 56:12.461
Always looking to knock something
down just because it's standing.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.591
It's right there.

56:21.962 --> 56:23.964
It's right there.

56:24.381 --> 56:27.134
You really want to
knock something down?

56:28.802 --> 56:30.304
Try using that.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.897
Because I will
tell you straight,

56:35.976 --> 56:38.820
I don't have
anything against you.

56:39.479 --> 56:43.325
I have the highest
expectations for you.

56:53.118 --> 56:54.961
Lieutenant Little,

56:55.913 --> 56:58.211
I need everyone on
this next mission.

56:58.290 --> 57:02.420
And you're lucky you're the
best damn pilot we've got.

57:02.502 --> 57:04.425
Report to your unit.

57:06.048 --> 57:07.595
<i>Bless you</i>

57:07.674 --> 57:11.395
<i>For being an angel</i>

57:12.971 --> 57:15.941
<i>Just when it seemed</i>

57:16.016 --> 57:20.021
<i>That heaven was not for me</i>

57:21.688 --> 57:25.818
<i>Bless you, for building...</i>

57:32.449 --> 57:34.372
They let you out, huh?

57:35.661 --> 57:37.083
Or did you bust out?

57:37.162 --> 57:38.539
Very funny.

57:40.916 --> 57:42.042
Look, uh.

57:43.835 --> 57:45.803
I said some things.

57:45.879 --> 57:47.381
Yeah, you did.

57:49.341 --> 57:51.309
I didn't mean them.

57:51.385 --> 57:52.887
Yeah, you did.

57:55.180 --> 57:58.184
You know me. Act
first, think later.

58:00.102 --> 58:02.025
Well, nobody's perfect.

58:04.147 --> 58:05.194
We good?

58:07.109 --> 58:08.736
Yeah, we're good.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.585
I figured it out.

58:21.415 --> 58:23.759
What? That throwing punches
doesn't solve your problems?

58:24.793 --> 58:25.840
No.

58:27.462 --> 58:30.215
That maneuver Pretty Boy
pulled on me, got on my tail,

58:30.298 --> 58:32.471
I figured out how to do it.

58:34.469 --> 58:36.392
Fancy trick flying
will only get you killed.

58:36.930 --> 58:38.603
Or make me an ace.

58:43.854 --> 58:49.202
The American pilots flying escort now
go for every kill they can score.

58:49.276 --> 58:52.746
That's how they were trained.
That's how they fight.

58:54.156 --> 58:57.330
Here's how we change up the strategy.
Lights up.

58:58.744 --> 59:03.545
At all costs, under every circumstance,
you protect the heavies.

59:03.623 --> 59:04.875
Colonel.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.843
We signed up to shoot
Germans, not babysit planes.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.800
You signed up to follow orders.

59:13.633 --> 59:16.136
One bomber, that's 10 men.

59:16.219 --> 59:20.975
You getting one Jerry so you
can put a cross on your plane,

59:21.058 --> 59:23.106
that doesn't balance that.

59:24.144 --> 59:25.896
We count our victories

59:25.979 --> 59:29.358
by the bombers we
get to their targets.

59:29.441 --> 59:32.741
By the husbands we
return to their wives.

59:33.820 --> 59:37.165
By the fathers we get
back to their children.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.953
What has not changed,
what will never change,

59:41.495 --> 59:45.671
from the last plane, to the last
bullet, to the last minute,

59:45.749 --> 59:47.797
to the last man, we fight.

59:49.002 --> 59:50.299
We fight!

59:50.378 --> 59:51.675
Yes, sir!

59:59.763 --> 01:00:02.642
We've secured new aircrafts.
P-51s.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.602
The best the AAF's got.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:09.990
As soon as we get the A-okay, we'll
begin ferrying them in from Bari.

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:13.869
Dismissed.

01:00:29.167 --> 01:00:31.044
Say cheese, say cheese.

01:00:31.503 --> 01:00:32.504
Whoo-hoo!

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.055
My, my, my!

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:36.891
Hey, Maurice!
How are they flying?

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:39.728
Like angels.

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:42.769
I don't know any angels with
six .50-caliber machine guns.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:45.442
All right, men, get your manuals.
Get familiar.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.110
Coffee!
Yes, sir.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:50.155
We'll need them all marked
up and ready to fly.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:51.277
It's taken care of.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:54.906
The Major says paint their tails
bright red, so they stand out.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.157
Like the Red Baron.

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:57.995
Loud and proud.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.197
Appreciate it.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.411
Beautiful.

01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:15.055
<i>Blue skies smiling at me</i>

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:20.474
<i>Nothing but blue skies do I see</i>

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:23.101
This will definitely make
the group distinctive.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.184
Bright red tails
and black pilots?

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.271
You can't call us nothing
else but distinctive.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:34.942
From now on.

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:40.326
<i>Never saw the sun
shining so bright</i>

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.579
<i>Never saw things going so right</i>

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.331
What do you think?

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:48.459
It's like it's speeding
even when it's sitting.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.135
I never even met a girl
as beautiful as this plane.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.130
Well, take good care of her.

01:01:57.172 --> 01:01:58.640
What do you mean?

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.717
I twisted
the Flight Surgeon's arm.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.598
Got you back on the roster.

01:02:02.677 --> 01:02:04.554
You going up with us
next mission.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:11.569
Uh...

01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:13.522
Sorry.
Thank you, sir.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.941
I'm going to tell the guys.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.018
Heavenly Father, we thank
you for this glorious day.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.069
We ask that you
send your angels down

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:56.068
to surround us as we
fly through the sky.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.408
We know that it's
part of your master plan

01:02:58.483 --> 01:03:01.532
that we've made it all the way
from Tuskegee here to Ramitelli.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.247
We are very confident
in our abilities,

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:08.372
but we ask that you give
us the vision, the sight,

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.833
and the speed and power to
make it through this mission.

01:03:10.912 --> 01:03:14.291
All the airmen say, "In
Jesus' name we pray." Amen.

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.466
Amen.

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:17.590
- Nothing's difficult.
- Everything's a challenge.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.637
- Through adversity...
- ...to the stars!

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.636
From the last plane,
to the last bullet,

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:23.558
to the last minute, to
the last man, we fight!

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.010
We fight!

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:26.219
We fight!

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:28.512
Anybody got eyes
on the bombers?

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:30.222
Uh...

01:05:30.301 --> 01:05:34.522
We are all by our lonesome, Red One.
Think we screwed up.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:38.978
Right on target, and according to
my reckoning, 32 seconds early.

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:40.604
We're here.
They're not.

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:43.148
Maybe the bombers turned back.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.367
Damn! Maybe they
went on without us.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.537
Red One, there they are.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.410
Nine o'clock low.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.042
Junior, head on over
to the bomber leader.

01:05:58.204 --> 01:05:59.581
<i>Let him know we're friendlies.</i>

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:01.041
Roger that.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:07.714
Bogies! Three high.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.094
<i>Everybody, on your guns.</i>

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:12.678
<i>Counting close to 70 chicks.
We got one coming down.</i>

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.524
Hold your fire.
They're ours.

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:21.478
Red tails? I don't
recognize the markings.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:23.738
He's colored.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:25.152
Yeah, right.

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:27.233
Hell if I'm joking!
Look.

01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:32.239
Jesus Christ. They
can't all be colored.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:35.041
One fighter group of all Negro pilots?
I don't believe it!

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:38.916
What the hell do we do?

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:42.132
Tacoma One to all planes.
Everybody's eyes open.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.795
<i>I don't think
our fighter escort</i>

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:45.343
<i>is gonna be much
help this trip.</i>

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.771
Flying Fortresses!
At least a hundred!

01:06:59.015 --> 01:07:02.019
Decoy Squadron, move in
and draw off those fighters.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:09.867
Fighters, four o'clock.

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.362
They're not attacking.
Let them go.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.492
Let them go?

01:07:13.613 --> 01:07:15.741
Our orders are to
stay with the bombers.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.664
Uh. What? What?
You're breaking up.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:22.623
You heard Colonel Bullard. Forget
the prize, save the lives.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:25.087
God, I hate this war.

01:07:27.502 --> 01:07:30.130
Look at that. Those Red
Tails are staying put.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:32.719
They're giving up
glory to save our asses.

01:07:34.509 --> 01:07:35.556
We'll have to do
this the hard way...

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:36.724
...Break!

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:45.111
Here we go, Lightning.

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:46.233
Right behind you.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.453
Where'd this jackass come from?

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:05.085
Get out of there, Lightning!
Come on, get out of there!

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.089
Don't you worry about me.
I'm just playing with him.

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:11.589
Stop fooling around!
Damn it, I'm coming.

01:08:11.713 --> 01:08:13.010
<i>No, you're not.
Stay put.</i>

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:18.886
I'm gonna show him
a little trick I learned.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:29.568
Whoo! Ha-ha!

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:34.077
Lightning, when are you gonna
learn this is not a game?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.573
Coming up on
anti-aircraft guns.

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.707
Back off! We'll get
'em on the way back...

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:44.871
Break! Break!

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.179
Those Jerries are
hightailing it out of here.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.634
Flak's getting thick.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.687
Break off. Circle clear of the
flak until the bombers return.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.267
Good luck, bombardiers!

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.455
All bombs away! Let's get
the hell out of here.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.300
Here they come.
Form up.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.343
Move in...

01:09:36.421 --> 01:09:37.469
...Concentrate
on the stragglers!

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:43.475
Hey, Junior! You got
a bandit on your left!

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:44.930
Get out of there.
I'll take him.

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.350
<i>Junior, get out of there!</i>

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:49.068
Where is he?
I can't see him!

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.153
Ah!

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:57.819
Junior, where are you?
Are you all right?

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.446
I'm all right!

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.455
<i>Junior, you're on fire!</i>

01:10:01.948 --> 01:10:04.167
Junior, get out of the plane!

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:05.619
Junior!

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:11.173
Come on, Junior, bail!

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.468
Geronimo!

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:49.332
We didn't lose a single plane.

01:10:49.495 --> 01:10:51.293
Well, that's a first.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.419
Red One, Deke's trailing fuel!

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:58.213
Don't look good.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:01.758
Deke, talk to me.
What's your status?

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.177
I'm all right.

01:11:04.385 --> 01:11:08.106
I got gas spraying everywhere,
but I think I'm gonna be okay.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:12.610
I'm a little dizzy, but
other than that, I'm fine.

01:11:12.685 --> 01:11:14.528
All right, listen up.

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.028
I'll give escort to Deke
. Everybody else head back to base.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.034
No, I'll stay. I'm his wingman.
I'll stay.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:23.155
Let me take him, Easy.
God, I hate this mask!

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:25.869
It's my call, Lightning.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.458
Your calls have been
a little off lately.

01:11:27.992 --> 01:11:30.370
What? What are you
talking about?

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.879
Junior shouldn't
have been up here.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:35.208
You got a problem with the
way I'm running this squad,

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.134
you talk to Bullard
about it, all right?

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.928
Until then, I'm in control.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.472
And my order for you right now
is to head back to base.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.058
Damn!

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.387
All right, Deke,
you'll be all right.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.687
I'll see you back at the ranch.

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:50.231
You got Black Jesus
with you, boy!

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.892
Thanks, Smokey.

01:12:00.775 --> 01:12:02.743
Well, get me home, Easy.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.404
No, sir. You're going
to get yourself home.

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:11.628
What the hell put the Captain
in such a bad mood?

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.956
He gets like that sometimes.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:16.791
He knows good and well he
shouldn't have let Junior fly.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:17.921
That boy was half blind.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.846
We're almost home.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:24.219
I hope we meet up with
those Red Tails next time.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.389
Listen, boys, the bombers
have passed their safe point.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:30.104
Our mission is over.
Let's head back to base.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:44.159
You guys are
taking the long way.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:47.114
I'm going to take a
shortcut down the coast.

01:12:47.238 --> 01:12:49.866
Come on now, Lightning. Ain't
no need to get all crazy.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:51.201
You know you got to stay
with your squadron.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:54.709
You stay with the slow-ass squadron.
I'm running low on fuel.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.922
And what if you
turn up missing?

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:58.921
Then I'll have to
break it to Major Stance.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.752
Well, break it to him gently.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.462
<i>Great, great, great!</i>

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:04.301
One's a drunk,
and the other one

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.053
does whatever
the hell he wants to do.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.055
Smokey, stay with him.

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:09.678
<i>And keep him out of trouble.</i>

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.138
Don't worry.
I'll stick with him.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.813
My head, it hurts.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:22.148
We're almost there, Deke.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:23.733
Stay with me.

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:31.329
Easy, I got blood all over
me, but I'm not bleeding.

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.289
<i>You're gonna be okay.
I'm right above you.</i>

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:37.796
Captain,
I'm getting real dizzy.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.166
I need to rest a minute.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:44.345
No, no. Stay alert, Deke.
I'm here with you.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.048
I can't really see anything!

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:51.019
Everything's all blurred!
I got double vision.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:55.516
You're slipping, Deke! Deke,
you're slipping! Steady up!

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:58.859
All right.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.483
All right.

01:14:12.365 --> 01:14:15.039
You're diving, Deke. You need
to pull back on your stick.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.539
<i>Pull up, Deke, pull up!</i>

01:14:22.249 --> 01:14:24.422
Deke, listen to me! Pull
back on your stick now!

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.633
<i>Pull up, Deke, pull up!</i>

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:27.964
Pull up?

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:32.139
Oh, I'm pulling up!
I'm pulling up!

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:34.391
Come on!

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.227
I must have passed out!

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.451
I need you to stay with me, okay?
Stay with me.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:49.735
<i>Just keep talking.</i>

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:50.911
All right.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:07.796
Lightning, look! German
destroyer, moving to the north!

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:14.310
I still got ammo.
How about you?

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:18.765
Nah. You need about a 500-pound
bomb to put a dent in that thing.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:22.234
Plus, that baby got very,
very big guns.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.608
Just watch me.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.614
Lightning, no, all right?
Don't be crazy.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:30.743
If the big guns don't kill you,
your plane will get messed up,

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:32.616
<i>and Coffee is gonna kill you.</i>

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:36.116
Relax, Smokey. Worrying
too much will kill you.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.605
All right! That was fun! Okay,
come on now, time to go home.

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.151
Just one more pass.

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:21.911
How do you like
that, Mr. Hitler?

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:25.131
Lightning, you a damn fool!
But I love you! Come on.

01:16:36.217 --> 01:16:38.390
Ramitelli to Subsoil Red One.
Do you read?

01:16:38.469 --> 01:16:40.847
<i>I got Red Four
with me, he's busted up pretty bad.</i>

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.855
Stay alert, Deke.
Stay alert.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.483
Ramitelli, have
a fire truck standing by.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:50.815
He's leaking fuel. I
repeat, he's leaking fuel.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.407
This is Major Stance.

01:16:55.486 --> 01:16:58.490
Circle a half-mile out
and have Red Four bail.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.582
Flight surgeons
will be there waiting.

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:01.705
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:05.671
You're gonna put it
into a left bank,

01:17:05.746 --> 01:17:07.214
and you're up and out.
All right?

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.719
I can't get the canopy open!

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:16.173
Easy!

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.762
Listen, Deke,
the only thing between

01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:19.435
you living and dying
is that canopy.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:20.636
Now, get it open!

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.605
I can't open it!

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:26.600
I can't open it!

01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.481
Red Four cannot
open his canopy.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:30.484
I repeat,
he cannot open his canopy.

01:17:30.563 --> 01:17:31.985
I'm gonna have to bring him in.

01:17:32.815 --> 01:17:34.237
Roger that.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.239
Sweet Jesus,

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:42.075
don't let this happen to me.

01:17:44.285 --> 01:17:46.333
Okay. Okay.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:48.835
<i>All right, Deke.
Flaps down.</i>

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:50.465
Flaps down.

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:55.595
There you go.

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:02.929
Level off, level off!

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:06.106
I'm leveling.

01:18:07.433 --> 01:18:09.310
Help me, sir.
I'm covered in fuel!

01:18:09.476 --> 01:18:11.478
I'm coming around
behind you, Deke.

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.701
All right,
now get your gear down.

01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:29.459
Easy! I think I'm
coming in too hot!

01:18:30.122 --> 01:18:33.592
I don't want to die!
I'm not ready!

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:36.420
Just relax.
Level off, Deke.

01:18:39.798 --> 01:18:42.142
Too fast.
I'm going too fast!

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:45.391
Nose up! Nose up!

01:18:46.805 --> 01:18:48.227
Come on!

01:18:52.436 --> 01:18:54.438
Drop your throttle!
Nose down!

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:55.864
<i>Nose down!</i>

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.989
No! No!

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:19.262
Shit!

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:35.020
Deke!

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:02.214
Smoke cloud on the left.

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:08.684
You don't think
that's Deke, do you?

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.887
Who was it?
Deke.

01:20:43.172 --> 01:20:44.594
It was Deke.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.138
Oh, shit.
An engine fire.

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:49.557
Gas leak must have
caught on the landing.

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:51.730
But I talked to the medics, they
said he's gonna be all right.

01:20:51.805 --> 01:20:53.102
Must have been a spark.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:54.649
What?

01:20:56.435 --> 01:20:58.233
You've been drinking.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:20:59.563
You're going to
blame this on me?

01:20:59.646 --> 01:21:01.114
Tell me you haven't
been drinking.

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.858
I got him down!
Say it!

01:21:02.941 --> 01:21:06.445
I got him down alive! You
don't blame this on me!

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.538
I did everything I could do!

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.867
Joe! Joe!

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:06.129
All back, Colonel.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:09.683
The good news is Lieutenant Watkins
survived the fireball landing.

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.268
He's in critical.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.016
Do they think
he's gonna make it?

01:22:13.137 --> 01:22:14.389
Yes, sir.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:19.023
With 60% third-degree burns.
We're sending him back home.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:25.233
I brought the background on the
captured flyer, Lieutenant Ray Gannon.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:28.744
His mother's name is Dorothy.
Father is Thomas.

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:32.491
His wife's name is Thelma. They
have a little girl, Adele.

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.375
In particular,
Ray loved to fly.

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:39.921
More than any pilot we have,
he loved to be in the air.

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:05.694
You must be Lt. Gannon.

01:23:06.023 --> 01:23:07.866
Welcome to Stalag 18.

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:12.454
You're the first of
your kind we've had here.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:16.162
I hope your stay
will not be cut short.

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:33.971
Here is the new prisoner
your captain requested,

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:35.969
Lieutenant Ray Gannon.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:39.519
A pilot with the 332nd.

01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:43.477
Where the hell
did you come from?

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.399
Lieutenant!

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.115
Sit down.

01:24:01.828 --> 01:24:04.377
So, I bet you're wondering why
I picked you to bunk with us.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.881
It's not something
I care to think about.

01:24:09.503 --> 01:24:10.925
Don't worry.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:13.591
It's not so we can
hang you or anything.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:17.019
I chose you because I know
you can't be a German spy,

01:24:17.386 --> 01:24:19.434
being colored and all.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.065
We're in the middle of a
rather delicate operation,

01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.393
and we don't need
any new white faces.

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:27.355
You'll be treated no differently
than any other man here.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.278
Any problems, you tell me.

01:24:34.361 --> 01:24:38.241
Come on! Let's go!
Move, move, move!

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:41.168
Line it up! Let's go!

01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:47.674
I welcome you to the 332nd Fighter Group.
You're a long way from home.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:53.088
Jerry's going down!

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:54.468
I'm telling you,
Lightning sunk it.

01:24:54.548 --> 01:24:57.017
That is a destroyer.
Shit, Lightning's crazy!

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:03.686
Here it comes!

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.021
Whoo!

01:25:06.226 --> 01:25:07.853
I came around for a second pass.
Watch this.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.828
We fight! We fight!

01:25:16.903 --> 01:25:19.201
We fight! We fight! We fight!

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:20.763
Mmm.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:32.900
My best friend.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:35.358
He...

01:26:36.566 --> 01:26:39.661
He almost caused the death
of one of our pilots.

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.208
I don't know what to do.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.883
I am so glad I found you.

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:33.002
I want you to stop, Easy.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.129
Stop what?

01:27:35.208 --> 01:27:36.676
You can't drink on duty.

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.754
I told you, what happened to
Deke wasn't my fault, all right?

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:40.839
No one cares what you do
when you're in town.

01:27:40.922 --> 01:27:42.174
How you relax is your business.

01:27:42.299 --> 01:27:43.767
This coming from
a guy who flies

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:46.186
like he has got some
kind of death wish.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:47.763
You're a piece of work, Joe.

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.689
You ignore me up there,
then all of a sudden,

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:51.108
you expect me to
listen to you down here.

01:27:51.183 --> 01:27:53.026
All right, all right, all right.

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:59.195
Tell you what.
I'll make you a deal.

01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:03.536
You promise to
ditch the bottle,

01:28:04.821 --> 01:28:06.494
I'll promise to fly right.

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:10.664
And follow my orders.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.585
And follow your orders.

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.134
Happy?

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:24.094
Very happy.

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:42.442
I can't wait to
hear her sweet singing!

01:28:42.526 --> 01:28:45.780
You guys can go chase skirt.
I'm going to Sofia's.

01:28:47.572 --> 01:28:49.245
What did you
say, about three miles?

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:50.834
Odds of us getting pinched?

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.911
I won't even take that action.

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:54.587
Hey, flyboys!

01:28:55.247 --> 01:28:57.500
That trouble. Keep walking.
Come on.

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:59.129
Don't just walk away from me.

01:28:59.209 --> 01:29:00.927
He picked the wrong day.
Let's go.

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:04.590
Hey, come over here!

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:09.761
What?

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.434
You guys.

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:15.851
You're the Red Tails, right?

01:29:18.395 --> 01:29:22.116
You know, Red Tails?
Colored boy flyers?

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:26.700
Well, I wouldn't necessarily say
it like that, but who's asking?

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.831
Chester Barnes,
98th Bomb Group.

01:29:29.948 --> 01:29:33.077
You guys flew a little top cover
for us about a month ago.

01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:35.287
A little run over Ploiesti?

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.044
It was the best goddamn flying
I've ever seen, gentlemen.

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:42.173
And we guys, well, we feel that
we owe all you boys a drink.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:46.131
Why don't you come and join us?
Come on.

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:51.891
Come and join them?

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.639
What's he saying?

01:29:54.639 --> 01:29:56.687
Come on.
Drinks are on us.

01:29:57.434 --> 01:29:59.232
Well, I'll be damned.

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:02.739
I guess the dance hall
will have to wait.

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.072
How you doing?
Much obliged.

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:15.085
<i>He was a famous trumpet man
from out Chicago way.</i>

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.754
<i>He had a boogie style
that no one else could play.</i>

01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:20.332
<i>He was the top man at his craft.</i>

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:23.385
<i>But then his number came up
and he was gone with the draft.</i>

01:30:23.710 --> 01:30:26.338
<i>He's in the army now
a-blowin' reveille.</i>

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:29.425
<i>He's the boogie woogie
bugle boy of Company B.</i>

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:32.306
<i>They made him blow a bugle
for his Uncle Sam.</i>

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:35.059
<i>It really brought him down
because he couldn't jam.</i>

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.607
<i>The captain seemed
to understand.</i>

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.776
All right, boys, listen up!

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:43.029
These fellas are the Red Tails.

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:45.857
They're the guys who have
been giving us an escort.

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:49.365
First drink is on me, fellas.
Whatever you'd like.

01:30:54.324 --> 01:30:56.201
Hanson, Travis J.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.786
Samuel George.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:01.586
Me and the boys over here
are with the 463rd Bomb Group.

01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:02.757
Glad to meet you, man.

01:31:02.832 --> 01:31:06.553
You flew with us over Brux
. Appreciate you getting us home.

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:14.391
Hey, have you guys run into
any of those new jet pursuit fighters?

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.179
We haven't been that lucky.

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:18.356
Well, we've been that unlucky.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:22.402
Those babies go so fast
you can't even see them.

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:33.781
You know,

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:36.161
we say "colored."

01:31:36.241 --> 01:31:40.417
But that's not what you prefer?

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:42.706
No, no.
The word is...

01:31:42.789 --> 01:31:44.041
"Negro."

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:50.673
When you get upset, when you
get mad, you turn red, right?

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:54.389
When you get envious or
sick, you turn green.

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:57.645
When you become cowardly,
you turn yellow.

01:31:57.721 --> 01:32:00.600
And y'all got the nerve
to call us colored.

01:32:35.467 --> 01:32:38.767
I want to ask you
an important question.

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.221
Um...

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:13.589
Will you marry me?

01:33:23.848 --> 01:33:24.974
Uh...

01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:31.238
Time to think.

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:34.863
Oh.

01:33:38.530 --> 01:33:39.656
Okay.

01:33:49.374 --> 01:33:50.796
When you get to
the other side, don't wait.

01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.718
Just run for the woods, okay?
Go!

01:33:53.461 --> 01:33:55.589
Remember, run for the woods!

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:58.133
It's Ray Gun, he's
back with the batteries.

01:33:58.216 --> 01:33:59.468
Any problems?

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:01.219
They won't even
know they're missing.

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:04.310
Divide the batteries among
those who have flashlights.

01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:06.107
You've been
a great help, Ray Gun.

01:34:06.182 --> 01:34:09.277
I guess there's a lot more to
you coloreds than I thought.

01:34:09.769 --> 01:34:12.864
We want you to travel with us.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:18.074
Oh, I can't. I'll stick out
like a pig in a poultry shop.

01:34:18.570 --> 01:34:20.197
I'll draw attention
to you guys.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.202
Thank you.

01:34:22.574 --> 01:34:24.542
I'll go alone.
But...

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:28.505
Here, take my dog tags.

01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:30.665
Get them back to my unit.

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:35.049
You're a wily sucker, Ray. At least
they won't see you in the dark.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.797
Good luck, Lieutenant.

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:40.724
Safe journey, Captain.
Good luck, Ray.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.143
Good luck.

01:34:44.095 --> 01:34:46.518
Remember, run for the woods.

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.441
Okay, let's go.

01:35:35.355 --> 01:35:37.153
- Run, Miller, run!
- Halt!

01:35:39.859 --> 01:35:40.985
Halt!

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:42.324
Halt, halt!

01:35:46.866 --> 01:35:54.842
<i>Hot tamales, and they're red
hot Yes, she got them for sale.</i>

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.293
<i>I got a girl,
she's long and tall.</i>

01:35:57.377 --> 01:35:59.675
<i>Sleeps in the kitchen
with her feets in the hall.</i>

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:02.883
Sticks on metal ain't music.
It ain't.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:04.509
I like music.

01:36:05.009 --> 01:36:07.933
Aww! Coffee, were you
always mean as hell,

01:36:08.012 --> 01:36:09.855
or you just get like
that with old age?

01:36:09.931 --> 01:36:13.401
I once was a happy man. Never did
not have a smile on my face.

01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:15.774
That was before you guys started
tearing up my beautiful planes.

01:36:16.688 --> 01:36:18.656
I could tolerate
the P-40s.

01:36:18.731 --> 01:36:21.985
But these new babies getting beat up?
It breaks my heart.

01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:26.369
Come on, Coffee. I only came
back with two holes this time.

01:36:27.156 --> 01:36:28.874
Uh. Six.
Six holes.

01:36:29.575 --> 01:36:31.953
Well, that ain't nothing compared
to what's gonna happen to you

01:36:32.036 --> 01:36:35.290
when you run into those jets those
bomber jockeys was talking about.

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:36.920
I ain't afraid of no jets.

01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:39.928
Don't go trying your
old tricks, Lightning.

01:36:40.003 --> 01:36:42.131
If you end up too close
behind one of those jets,

01:36:42.213 --> 01:36:44.432
the turbulence alone will blow your
black ass right out of the sky.

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:46.388
Trust me, I'm gonna
be the first one

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:47.844
to shoot one of
those things down.

01:36:47.927 --> 01:36:49.144
And I'll be the second.

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:52.190
My advice is, you see
one, run like hell.

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:54.646
The only thing in life that
makes me want to run like hell

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:56.194
is you, Coffee.

01:36:59.147 --> 01:37:02.367
That's gonna get you killed out there.
I'm not dancing with you.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:07.410
The target is a tank factory
on the outskirts of Berlin.

01:37:08.239 --> 01:37:13.666
Shut that down, you shut down Jerry's
ability to shore up a Berlin defense.

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:17.461
General Campbell's wing will
be leading the bombardment.

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:19.751
You have recon on the area?

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:22.462
In the air, we're expecting
everything the Luftwaffe's got,

01:37:22.545 --> 01:37:24.513
100s, 109s, 190s.

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:28.430
A possibility of 262s,
German jet fighters.

01:37:28.634 --> 01:37:29.886
Jet fighters?

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:31.263
The boys are
gonna love this one!

01:37:33.222 --> 01:37:35.725
The target area
isn't your concern.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.530
The 52nd will escort the
General's planes into Berlin.

01:37:42.398 --> 01:37:43.991
Is there a reason, sir?

01:37:44.067 --> 01:37:46.320
Sixteen hundred miles
to Berlin and back.

01:37:46.402 --> 01:37:48.905
The fighters need
to take it in stages.

01:37:48.988 --> 01:37:51.992
With external fuel tanks,
the 51s can make it.

01:37:52.075 --> 01:37:53.827
I guarantee our pilots can.

01:37:54.035 --> 01:37:56.914
I'd prefer the Red Tails take the
leg where we need protecting.

01:37:57.497 --> 01:38:00.341
Our first major air
offensive over Berlin.

01:38:01.459 --> 01:38:03.882
From a propaganda
point of view,

01:38:04.337 --> 01:38:06.886
a lot of attention gonna be paid
to this and a lot of ink spilled.

01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:10.306
And Negro pilots aren't
part of that story.

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.305
Colonel, A.J.

01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:18.935
This is coming
from way above me.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:21.441
If you didn't have my respect,

01:38:21.521 --> 01:38:24.320
I wouldn't be talking
to you face to face.

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:28.407
But we don't win this
war, all my regard,

01:38:28.486 --> 01:38:31.365
everything that you and
your men have done,

01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:35.159
none of it means a thing.

01:38:43.876 --> 01:38:45.128
Colonel.

01:38:45.962 --> 01:38:49.262
Please see to it that the
General gets to his plane.

01:38:49.924 --> 01:38:51.016
Sir.

01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:02.562
You like it?

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:13.532
I want you

01:39:14.323 --> 01:39:16.701
stay in Italia.

01:39:19.537 --> 01:39:21.289
You want me to stay?

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:26.711
Does that mean...

01:39:27.503 --> 01:39:29.301
Does that mean you'll marry me?

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:33.184
Yes. Marriage.

01:39:40.725 --> 01:39:42.102
I love you.

01:39:46.856 --> 01:39:48.574
I can't believe it.

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:54.322
I'm getting married.

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:04.632
Okay, we're going to throw it, all right?
There you go.

01:40:05.917 --> 01:40:08.261
There you go. All right. Throw!

01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:31.613
I'm looking for Captain Julian.

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:33.612
Right here.

01:40:36.822 --> 01:40:38.950
You the one they call Easy?

01:40:39.116 --> 01:40:42.120
I guess some people do.
What can I help you with?

01:40:42.411 --> 01:40:46.132
I'm Captain Miller. I was in
prison with Lieutenant Gannon.

01:40:46.749 --> 01:40:49.298
He asked me to
give his tags to you.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:54.674
Four of us got out.

01:40:55.132 --> 01:40:57.226
The deal was, if we
made it and he didn't,

01:40:57.301 --> 01:40:59.303
I'd get his dog tags
back to his unit.

01:41:01.681 --> 01:41:03.433
Ray was a good man.

01:41:04.308 --> 01:41:07.312
To whoever it matters,
you tell them from me.

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:10.152
Ray was the best
soldier I ever met.

01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:13.117
Thank you.

01:41:31.085 --> 01:41:32.758
A moment, Colonel.

01:41:35.256 --> 01:41:37.008
What is it, Captain?

01:41:41.012 --> 01:41:43.140
Ray Gannon's dog tags, sir.

01:41:46.017 --> 01:41:47.940
A soldier brought it by today.

01:41:48.019 --> 01:41:50.147
He and Ray were
prisoners together.

01:41:51.105 --> 01:41:53.733
They got out from
under the Germans,

01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:56.990
but Ray didn't make it.

01:42:02.825 --> 01:42:06.375
Sir, Ray Gun wasn't fit when
I put him back in rotation.

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:08.373
The Flight Surgeon
wouldn't clean bill him,

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:11.630
so I talked my way
right past him.

01:42:16.255 --> 01:42:19.885
I just don't feel like I'm fit
to lead the squad any more.

01:42:22.928 --> 01:42:24.521
I've made so many mistakes.

01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:27.191
No, you've made
one big mistake.

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:30.486
That self-pity of yours,
that's your weakness.

01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:33.276
But it ends right here,
right now.

01:42:34.273 --> 01:42:36.776
You man up,
you lead your squad.

01:42:38.277 --> 01:42:42.282
Every decision that you make isn't
gonna always be the right one.

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:53.459
All right, this is it.

01:42:54.210 --> 01:42:57.305
For the first time, the bombers
are going all the way to Berlin.

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:01.968
They'll be up against 109s and
262s the new jet fighters.

01:43:09.684 --> 01:43:12.187
Unfortunately, we're only
going to escort them

01:43:12.269 --> 01:43:14.271
on the first leg
of their mission,

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:16.107
so I don't expect
you'll see much action.

01:43:16.774 --> 01:43:19.869
You will rendezvous with the
relief escorts at 0830.

01:43:20.277 --> 01:43:23.952
I know this is disappointing to you.
It's not the job you wanted.

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:26.617
But those are your orders.

01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:28.711
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:32.173
Full briefing at 0400.
On the flight line at 0530.

01:43:32.248 --> 01:43:33.374
Spread the word, gentlemen.

01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:35.797
Julian. A moment.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:45.053
Captain, if your relief
doesn't arrive,

01:43:45.136 --> 01:43:47.389
as squadron leader,
it's your call.

01:43:47.471 --> 01:43:49.644
If you think you can make it.

01:43:50.516 --> 01:43:51.608
Sir.

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.686
That is all, son.

01:44:39.106 --> 01:44:40.528
We're past
the rendezvous point.

01:44:40.608 --> 01:44:42.906
Tail gunner, has the
52nd squadron arrived?

01:44:43.277 --> 01:44:45.450
No, sir.
No sign of them.

01:44:45.821 --> 01:44:47.869
Anybody got eyes on
our relief fighters?

01:44:48.199 --> 01:44:50.201
Not a dang thing, Red One.

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.787
Are we going all the way, sir?

01:44:52.912 --> 01:44:55.040
Fuel-wise,
we're looking good.

01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:57.466
But I'm guessing
the hours there and back,

01:44:57.541 --> 01:45:00.090
it'll definitely be
one for the record books.

01:45:00.377 --> 01:45:03.176
Come on, Easy.
It's Berlin.

01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:08.302
Let's go.
We can make it.

01:45:11.222 --> 01:45:15.318
All right, gentlemen. Brace yourselves.
We're going the distance.

01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:17.732
Yeah! We fight!

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:20.857
Ha-ha! Watch out,
Hitler, here we come!

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:24.114
Just remember, we're here
to protect the bombers.

01:45:24.235 --> 01:45:27.159
Under all circumstances,
we stay on mission.

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.250
What's that about?

01:45:31.408 --> 01:45:34.628
I think we've got the Red
Tails for the duration.

01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:45.051
By my reckoning,
we're deep into Germany.

01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:47.383
It's a little creepy we haven't
seen any fighters yet.

01:45:48.592 --> 01:45:51.345
Maybe they found out
we were flying escort

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:53.476
and decided not to show up.

01:45:53.722 --> 01:45:55.224
That'd be nice.

01:45:55.307 --> 01:45:57.526
Wouldn't mind that,
would you, baby?

01:46:05.818 --> 01:46:08.321
Colonel!
It's from Mission Control.

01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:11.202
The 52nd didn't
make the rendezvous.

01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:12.625
They didn't join
up with the 5th.

01:46:13.742 --> 01:46:15.289
Did our boys turn back?

01:46:15.452 --> 01:46:17.329
No, sir. They're
headed on to Berlin.

01:46:17.955 --> 01:46:20.333
I gave Captain Julian
the option.

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:24.341
Headquarters wants to know
if we're gonna call them back.

01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:26.381
Yes, sir!

01:46:48.444 --> 01:46:49.787
Show no mercy.

01:46:57.453 --> 01:46:59.376
Oh, shit! Jets!
We got jets!

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.001
What the hell?

01:47:05.210 --> 01:47:06.678
What? Oh, no!

01:47:13.093 --> 01:47:14.345
Maurice!

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:15.687
<i>Mama!</i>

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:18.016
<i>Break! Break! Break!</i>

01:47:18.515 --> 01:47:19.687
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:47:28.192 --> 01:47:29.819
Nine o'clock low!

01:47:31.654 --> 01:47:32.826
I see them.

01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:37.917
We're losing them!

01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:41.710
I got the throttle wide open!
They're too damn fast!

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:46.753
Son of a bitch!
Those babies are gone.

01:47:54.218 --> 01:47:55.845
I'm losing power!

01:47:56.053 --> 01:47:57.521
Stay left!
I'll get him!

01:48:02.518 --> 01:48:04.270
This is for Maurice!

01:48:08.273 --> 01:48:09.525
Yeah!

01:48:11.568 --> 01:48:13.787
Brilliant!
Smokey, brilliant!

01:48:24.498 --> 01:48:26.125
Easy, we got one
crossing in front of us.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:27.923
Start firing,
he'll fly right into it.

01:48:28.085 --> 01:48:29.382
I know.
I got him.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.852
These jets ain't nothing.

01:48:37.928 --> 01:48:39.225
<i>We need more speed.</i>

01:48:39.304 --> 01:48:40.772
Let's get some altitude.

01:48:51.984 --> 01:48:53.452
Easy, right there!
Ten o'clock!

01:48:56.488 --> 01:48:57.956
I got him!

01:49:05.956 --> 01:49:07.799
Now that's how it's done!

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.643
Smokey! Smokey!

01:49:19.845 --> 01:49:22.064
I'm all right.
I'm all right!

01:49:23.849 --> 01:49:26.147
I'll be damned!
They missed me!

01:49:26.351 --> 01:49:28.900
No holes in me, baby!
Whoo! Come on.

01:49:35.486 --> 01:49:36.658
Now we're losing
power on engine four.

01:49:36.737 --> 01:49:39.240
That's it for us, guys.
We're turning around.

01:49:46.705 --> 01:49:48.707
We got a straggler.
Two o'clock.

01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:51.009
<i>Oh, I see him!</i>

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:54.842
I'm on it, Red One. We'll get
down there and cover him.

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:04.602
Lightning, form up.
I'm going back.

01:50:04.723 --> 01:50:06.896
We got a crippled
bomber to protect.

01:50:09.228 --> 01:50:12.072
Easy, you got Pretty Boy on your tail.
I'm coming around.

01:50:12.147 --> 01:50:13.694
Where? I don't see him!

01:50:15.359 --> 01:50:16.326
Die, you...

01:50:16.401 --> 01:50:17.402
...foolish African!

01:50:18.362 --> 01:50:20.330
Damn it!

01:50:25.744 --> 01:50:27.121
I'm heading right for you!

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:31.382
I've got him!
I've got him!

01:50:32.209 --> 01:50:33.381
Get out of my way!

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.712
What the hell are you doing?

01:50:34.795 --> 01:50:36.263
Dive right now! Dive.

01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:51.653
Whoo!

01:50:54.273 --> 01:50:56.742
That's the end of Pretty Boy!

01:51:07.494 --> 01:51:09.496
Sure got him good!

01:51:09.997 --> 01:51:11.874
Ha! You did it!

01:51:12.207 --> 01:51:13.709
You got that son of a bitch.

01:51:15.711 --> 01:51:17.839
Did you say Lightning
shot down Pretty Boy?

01:51:17.921 --> 01:51:18.968
Whoo-hoo!

01:51:19.047 --> 01:51:20.765
Give 'em hell, Lightning!

01:51:20.841 --> 01:51:23.185
You just might be the best
pilot that ever lived!

01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:25.729
<i>Now get your ass back here
and help us with this bomber.</i>

01:51:25.804 --> 01:51:28.557
<i>We're on our way back
to you, Joker.</i>

01:51:35.105 --> 01:51:38.234
It was a crazy move. You
almost got yourself killed.

01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.954
<i>I think I did
get myself killed.</i>

01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:45.039
What are you talking about?

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:49.961
I don't think
I'm going to make it, Easy.

01:51:51.788 --> 01:51:53.961
What do you mean, you're
not going to make it?

01:51:54.333 --> 01:51:56.210
<i>Don't talk like that!</i>

01:51:57.127 --> 01:51:59.801
There's a lot...
There's a lot of blood.

01:52:01.632 --> 01:52:03.225
Listen to me.
Just hang in there.

01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:04.802
I'm gonna get you back,
all right?

01:52:05.010 --> 01:52:07.058
<i>Just stay focused.
I'm gonna help you.</i>

01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:12.734
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

01:52:12.809 --> 01:52:16.859
<i>Come on now. We've gotten out
of worse scrapes than this.</i>

01:52:16.939 --> 01:52:20.193
I screwed up.

01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:22.118
I don't care about that.
I'm right here with you.

01:52:22.194 --> 01:52:24.788
We can do this together.
Come on.

01:52:25.197 --> 01:52:26.323
Easy.

01:52:28.951 --> 01:52:30.373
Gruesome Twosome.

01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:33.664
Lightning!
Lightning, talk to me!

01:52:33.747 --> 01:52:35.875
Lightning, don't you
do this to me!

01:52:35.958 --> 01:52:39.508
<i>Lightning?
Lightning, look at me!</i>

01:52:40.295 --> 01:52:41.467
I love you.

01:52:42.089 --> 01:52:44.091
I'm sorry, Sofia.

01:53:01.525 --> 01:53:04.654
Lightning, pull up!
Pull back on your stick!

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:10.993
Lightning, pop the canopy!
Pop the goddamn canopy!

01:53:15.372 --> 01:53:17.045
Get out of the plane,
Lightning, that's an order!

01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:19.547
<i>Get out of the plane!</i>

01:53:29.928 --> 01:53:31.930
Damn you, Lightning!

01:53:39.271 --> 01:53:40.397
Easy.

01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:42.740
Easy.

01:53:47.404 --> 01:53:49.406
<i>Easy, do you read me?</i>

01:53:51.783 --> 01:53:52.909
Easy!

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:56.087
Stay on mission!

01:53:58.498 --> 01:53:59.920
Do you copy?

01:54:03.003 --> 01:54:04.880
We need you back here.

01:54:08.967 --> 01:54:10.310
We need you.

01:54:11.762 --> 01:54:14.811
<i>For God's sake, tell me
you still out there.</i>

01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:17.268
I'm okay.
I'm on my way down.

01:54:22.606 --> 01:54:23.903
Red One.

01:54:24.775 --> 01:54:26.903
Lightning's with you, right?

01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:36.578
Lieutenant Little is dead.

01:55:24.876 --> 01:55:26.219
Lightning?

01:56:36.573 --> 01:56:37.745
Marty?

01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:10.445
The expectations
placed upon you men are high.

01:57:11.483 --> 01:57:13.281
Lieutenant Little

01:57:13.985 --> 01:57:16.158
exceeded those expectations.

01:57:16.738 --> 01:57:19.287
We should not be
discouraged by his death,

01:57:19.366 --> 01:57:22.290
but be all the more
encouraged by his life.

01:57:23.203 --> 01:57:25.752
The acts of bravery by him

01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:27.707
will make us stronger.

01:57:28.041 --> 01:57:30.885
It will inspire us
to fight harder,

01:57:30.961 --> 01:57:33.305
to make this world free.

01:57:33.755 --> 01:57:36.975
Because we are on the side
of God Almighty!

01:57:37.968 --> 01:57:39.390
Let us pray.

01:57:40.971 --> 01:57:43.144
Hey! Hey, guys!

01:57:47.269 --> 01:57:50.523
Hey! Guys!

01:57:52.107 --> 01:57:54.656
I know you didn't
forget about me already!

01:57:54.734 --> 01:57:56.862
I've been to hell and back,

01:57:58.697 --> 01:58:01.325
so you will no longer
call me Junior.

01:58:01.992 --> 01:58:07.089
From now on you will address
me as the fabulous Ray Gun.

01:58:08.331 --> 01:58:09.674
How'd you do it, man?

01:58:09.791 --> 01:58:11.338
I'll be damned!

01:58:15.964 --> 01:58:17.011
Ray!

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:18.091
Ray Gun!

01:58:18.174 --> 01:58:19.517
Boy, you look good.

01:58:38.903 --> 01:58:42.203
<i>In the name of the
President of the United States,</i>

01:58:42.282 --> 01:58:45.161
<i>a Distinguished Unit Citation
has been conferred upon</i>

01:58:45.243 --> 01:58:48.213
<i>the all-Negro
332nd Fighter Group</i>

01:58:48.747 --> 01:58:52.593
<i>for outstanding performance of
duty in conflict with the enemy.</i>

01:58:53.168 --> 01:58:58.140
<i>By the conspicuous gallantry, professional
skill and determination of the pilots,</i>

01:58:58.214 --> 01:59:00.717
<i>together with the
outstanding technical skill</i>

01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.519
<i>and devotion to duty
