00:05.431 --> 00:07.552
from the Nobel Prize foundation.

00:07.620 --> 00:10.206
I'm calling to inform Mr. Bugs Bunny

emergency, and I--

00:56.626 --> 00:58.919
Wow. I'm glad you're OK, Porky.

00:58.934 --> 01:00.669
But you know,
next time that happens,

01:00.692 --> 01:02.144
you really should call someone.

01:02.162 --> 01:04.230
[Doorbell rings]
Oh, got to go.

01:04.309 --> 01:06.176
[Beeps]

[Vehicle departs]

01:09.681 --> 01:11.815
Sweden?

01:14.687 --> 01:16.154
- What's that?

01:16.176 --> 01:18.457
- Huh. I guess I won
the Nobel Prize.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.631
- What's the Nobel Prize?

01:20.646 --> 01:22.412
- An award given to
those who have made

01:22.413 --> 01:24.962
the greatest contributions to
the betterment of humanity.

01:25.029 --> 01:27.464
- Oh, the betterment of humanity!

01:27.532 --> 01:29.299
That's why I haven't won one.

01:29.367 --> 01:32.136
- I wonder where I should put it.

01:32.203 --> 01:34.304
- Ugh, you're going to display it?

01:34.372 --> 01:36.666
That's so tacky, so showy.

01:36.682 --> 01:38.196
Have a little decorum.

01:38.224 --> 01:41.238
- What about that thing?

01:41.254 --> 01:42.418
- This?

01:46.389 --> 01:48.839
- Do you know how many daughters
there are in the world?

01:48.861 --> 01:49.744
Millions.

01:49.745 --> 01:50.787
And I,

01:50.791 --> 01:52.956
"Sandra Sanchez,"

01:53.024 --> 01:54.725
Am the world's greatest.

01:54.792 --> 01:57.661
I'll get your own shelf.

01:57.729 --> 01:59.796
[Sighs]

02:01.666 --> 02:03.100
- Here your shelf.

02:03.113 --> 02:04.501
You know, for an additional $20,

02:04.514 --> 02:06.236
We'd be happy to install it for you.

02:06.304 --> 02:09.406
- $20 to install a shelf?

02:09.473 --> 02:11.068
I won a Nobel Prize!

02:11.068 --> 02:13.610
I think I can put up my own shelf.

02:18.316 --> 02:19.616
Looks secure.

02:19.684 --> 02:21.012
[Rattles]

02:21.019 --> 02:21.809
Hmm.

02:21.810 --> 02:23.738
I guess I need to find a stud.

02:23.754 --> 02:27.418
[Tapping]

02:27.426 --> 02:28.528
[Clunks]
- Ah.

02:28.529 --> 02:29.693
Here we go.

02:29.761 --> 02:30.559
Yep.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.197
That's the stud right there.

02:35.934 --> 02:37.834
Guess that wasn't a stud.

02:37.902 --> 02:41.862
You guys have anything to fill in
a couple of tiny, little holes?

02:41.906 --> 02:43.273
Barely anything.

02:43.341 --> 02:44.608
- You mean spackle?

02:44.676 --> 02:46.276
- Yeah, spackle.

02:46.344 --> 02:48.178
Some people call it spackle.

02:48.246 --> 02:49.513
Aisle 19.

02:49.581 --> 02:52.010
You having trouble
putting up that shelf?

02:52.034 --> 02:52.738
- What?

02:52.755 --> 02:54.017
No.

02:54.085 --> 02:55.639
I put that up no problem.

02:55.655 --> 02:57.321
Just hammered it right in there.

02:57.388 --> 02:58.382
- Hammered?

02:58.383 --> 03:00.231
You used a drill, right?

03:00.247 --> 03:01.302
- Of course.

03:01.303 --> 03:04.294
Drilled it right in there.

03:04.362 --> 03:06.763
Are the drills anywhere
near the spackle?

03:10.106 --> 03:12.012
Well, the award will cover that.

03:14.693 --> 03:17.061
[Drill whirring]

[Doorbell rings]

03:19.944 --> 03:21.411
Oh, Hi, Tina.

03:21.479 --> 03:23.580
- Hey. Picking up Daffy.
Date night.

03:23.648 --> 03:25.282
Oh, is that a Timmel?

03:25.350 --> 03:26.678
- Huh? Oh, yeah.

03:26.679 --> 03:28.418
That's my brand, Timmel.

03:28.486 --> 03:30.654
Is that what you said, Timmel?

03:32.323 --> 03:33.690
- What you working on?

03:33.758 --> 03:35.525
- Just putting up a shelf.

03:35.593 --> 03:37.265
[Whirring and clanking]

03:37.288 --> 03:38.862
- Oh, that doesn't sound good.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.023
- It's fine.

03:40.024 --> 03:41.932
I'm sure I just hit a stud.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.094
- That's not a stud.

03:43.095 --> 03:45.569
You either hit your junction
box or a water pipe.

03:45.637 --> 03:46.840
- Thanks for your help,

03:46.848 --> 03:48.248
But I think I know what I'm doing.

03:48.473 --> 03:50.741
I mean, I won the Nobel Prize.

03:50.808 --> 03:53.148
[Whirs and clanks]

03:53.164 --> 03:54.511
- There, see?

03:54.579 --> 03:56.880
- What happened to the water?

03:56.948 --> 03:58.282
- Guess it was your water pipe.

03:58.349 --> 03:59.449
- What are you doing here?

03:59.517 --> 04:00.784
- Date night.
Remember?

04:00.852 --> 04:02.368
Isn't that why you're in the shower?

04:02.383 --> 04:02.985
- What?

04:02.986 --> 04:04.859
No. I got peanut butter
all over my back.

04:04.889 --> 04:06.723
When's the water going to come back on.

04:06.791 --> 04:08.725
Well, first, he's got
to remove the drywall,

04:08.738 --> 04:09.846
saw off the damaged pipe,

04:09.847 --> 04:11.112
and put on a slip coupler.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.730
Then, he's going to
replace the drywall,

04:12.737 --> 04:14.984
spray the texture
on, and paint it.

04:15.101 --> 04:18.039
- I could do it for you, but it
would take a couple of days.

04:18.062 --> 04:19.503
- A couple of days?

04:19.570 --> 04:21.404
I can't go without a
shower for that long!

04:21.471 --> 04:23.640
- Since when do you
take so many showers?

04:23.708 --> 04:25.108
- It's the principle.

04:25.176 --> 04:26.730
If I'm going to pay
rent somewhere,

04:26.744 --> 04:28.312
then I want everything to work.

04:28.379 --> 04:29.513
- You don't pay rent.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.148
- And I won't,

04:31.215 --> 04:33.183
Not until that's fixed.

04:33.251 --> 04:34.740
Now where am I supposed to live?

04:34.752 --> 04:36.452
They won't let me
back at the "Y".

04:36.453 --> 04:37.688
Long story.

04:39.157 --> 04:40.828
- I guess you could stay with me.

04:40.906 --> 04:41.992
- I don't think so,

04:42.060 --> 04:43.927
not until there's a
ring on this finger.

04:43.995 --> 04:45.562
[Hissing]

04:45.630 --> 04:46.256
Here.

04:46.257 --> 04:48.799
Looks like you're
going to need this.

04:48.833 --> 04:49.888
Hey.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.176
My eyes are up here.

04:56.973 --> 04:58.807
- Thanks for letting me stay here, Porky.

04:58.875 --> 05:00.208
- It will be fun.

05:00.276 --> 05:03.412
It can get kind of lonely living
in this big old house by myself.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.014
Well, this is the guest bedroom.

05:09.482 --> 05:10.015
- Great.

05:10.071 --> 05:12.640
I'm sure you'll be
very comfortable here.

- [Deep voice] Shelf?

05:24.166 --> 05:25.274
Ha ha ha.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.091
You must have me confused
with somebody else.

05:28.115 --> 05:30.223
I'm a totally different customer.

05:30.239 --> 05:32.177
Never been here before.

05:32.576 --> 05:33.729
- Just the saw?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.276
- Uh, yeah.

05:35.277 --> 05:37.924
Oh, I'm also going to need a...

05:37.940 --> 05:39.467
Slip coupler.

05:39.491 --> 05:41.358
- Oh. You got a
cracked water pipe?

05:41.389 --> 05:42.507
- Oh, yeah. Heh.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.803
You know how that goes.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.757
Water was pouring
out when I left.

05:45.789 --> 05:47.975
- You mean, you didn't
shut off the water main?

05:48.871 --> 05:51.039
- [Screaming]

05:51.097 --> 05:53.581
[Normal voice] Keep the change!

05:59.989 --> 06:01.516
- Congratulations!

06:01.528 --> 06:03.942
- Lola, I got to get inside
and shut off the water main,

06:03.943 --> 06:04.887
whatever that is.

06:04.903 --> 06:06.708
- Winning the Nobel Prize?

06:06.709 --> 06:07.848
That's amazing!

06:07.903 --> 06:08.871
- Lola, move it!

06:08.903 --> 06:10.614
- I mean, no bells.

06:10.615 --> 06:11.387
None.

06:11.419 --> 06:12.668
I can't live without bells.

06:12.691 --> 06:14.859
[Jangling]

06:16.672 --> 06:18.840
- I think my house is flooded!

06:23.278 --> 06:24.705
- Wow!

06:24.706 --> 06:27.488
Someone wins the Nobel Prize
and thinks they're pretty hot.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.543
Well, guess what?

06:28.544 --> 06:29.918
You're not, all right?

06:29.941 --> 06:32.543
All you did was not
have a bell, Mmm-Kay?

06:32.558 --> 06:34.621
Anyone could do that. I
could totally do that.

06:34.652 --> 06:36.980
Who am I kidding? No I can't.
Bells are so fun!

06:36.995 --> 06:38.860
[Jangling]

06:46.491 --> 06:47.569
- What's going on, man?

06:47.570 --> 06:48.592
I was taking a nap.

06:48.607 --> 06:49.770
I almost drowned!

06:52.211 --> 06:53.879
- I was trying to put up a shelf,

06:53.897 --> 06:55.531
and I drilled into a water pipe.

06:55.546 --> 06:58.023
- Why didn't you just pay
someone to put it up for you?

06:58.038 --> 06:58.796
I don't get it.

06:58.822 --> 07:00.389
- I won the Nobel Prize.

07:00.425 --> 07:02.031
I think I can put up a shelf.

07:02.063 --> 07:03.809
- Oh, the Nobel Prize, huh?

07:03.810 --> 07:04.839
What did you get it for?

07:04.863 --> 07:06.020
Making bad decisions?

07:06.088 --> 07:08.923
[Jangling]

07:08.991 --> 07:10.802
- Speedy, what are you doing here?

07:11.003 --> 07:12.098
-  I live here.

07:12.101 --> 07:13.817
Or at least I used to.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.708
- Wait a minute.
You live in Bugs' house?

07:15.730 --> 07:18.265
Don't you own a restaurant? Can't
you afford your own place?

07:18.333 --> 07:19.667
- Mmm.
Probably.

07:19.734 --> 07:22.136
- Speedy, we're adults, M'kay?

07:22.204 --> 07:23.671
Adults live on their own.

07:23.738 --> 07:24.754
- Where do you live?

07:24.755 --> 07:25.739
- With my parents.

07:25.807 --> 07:27.675
They gave me these bells!

07:29.700 --> 07:30.832
[Knocks on door]

07:30.894 --> 07:31.912
- What's up?

07:31.980 --> 07:34.648
- Oh, I was just going
to do some laundry.

07:34.716 --> 07:36.984
So I need to get my laundry basket.

07:37.052 --> 07:38.263
- I'll get it.

07:40.956 --> 07:41.815
Here you go.

07:41.816 --> 07:42.723
- Thanks.

07:42.791 --> 07:43.792
- Hold it.

07:43.793 --> 07:45.993
These are my whites.

07:46.061 --> 07:47.828
These are my darks.

07:47.896 --> 07:49.845
Oh! And...

07:49.846 --> 07:51.165
These are my delicates.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.067
I've never seen you wear clothes.

07:53.134 --> 07:54.902
I like having the option.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.537
Now, pay attention.

07:56.605 --> 07:58.772
The delicates don't
go in the machine.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.442
These are 100% silk.

08:01.509 --> 08:03.834
They need to be hand washed.

08:03.835 --> 08:04.545
Got it?

08:04.568 --> 08:05.746
- I think.

08:05.814 --> 08:06.914
Repeat it back to me.

08:06.982 --> 08:10.351
- Uh, darks, whites, delicates.

08:10.418 --> 08:11.785
- What about the delicates?

08:11.853 --> 08:13.554
- Hand wash them?

08:16.024 --> 08:19.426
- Oh, and I'm having a lady
friend over for dinner tonight,

08:19.494 --> 08:21.862
so here's a list for
the grocery store.

08:21.930 --> 08:24.365
- Ooh, who are we having dinner with?

08:24.432 --> 08:27.134
I'm having dinner with my girlfriend.

08:27.202 --> 08:29.630
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:29.631 --> 08:31.505
I'm in the middle of something.

08:34.943 --> 08:36.710
It's fun having a roommate.

08:36.778 --> 08:37.981
- All right.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.147
Let's see what we got here.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.018
Looks like we got a big

08:45.019 --> 08:47.321
hole in the wall.

08:47.389 --> 08:48.737
OK.

08:48.738 --> 08:51.859
So I guess I just need to
make a cut here and here,

08:51.926 --> 08:53.512
Then remove this part,

08:53.513 --> 08:54.777
put in a slip coupler,

08:54.796 --> 08:56.497
Then somehow...

08:56.564 --> 08:58.032
Fix this whole wall,

08:58.099 --> 08:59.630
Pop in the ol' shelf,

08:59.631 --> 09:01.379
and we're done.

09:01.403 --> 09:03.003

I don't know.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.754
It's not really my taste.

18:40.822 --> 18:43.490
I guess I could make it work.

Get rid of some of this

I'm a Nobel Prize winner.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.482
I know how to fix a house.

21:50.513 --> 21:51.979

21:52.788 --> 21:54.656
Let me know if you
need anything else.
