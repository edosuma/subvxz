[Cricket] So, grass,
you dare to stand in my way?

00:04.587 --> 00:06.626
[fighting grunts]

00:06.627 --> 00:08.916
Ha ha! Success! I rule.

00:08.917 --> 00:10.416
Aah! Street goblin!

00:10.417 --> 00:12.416
Oh, wait, it's just an ugly dog.

00:12.417 --> 00:13.666
[coughs]

00:13.667 --> 00:14.836
Where'd you come from, buddy?

00:14.837 --> 00:15.966
[whimpers]

00:15.967 --> 00:17.206
Aw, you must be lost.

00:17.207 --> 00:18.916
You don't live
too far from here.

00:18.917 --> 00:20.966
Better get ya home
before Tilly tries to keep ya.

00:20.967 --> 00:23.626
[Tilly] Oh, I sense
an unfamiliar canine energy!

00:23.627 --> 00:24.797
Come on, hurry! Let's go!

00:26.127 --> 00:28.006
Hello! Hello, hello, hello!

00:28.007 --> 00:29.756
Hello? Oh, my gosh!

00:29.757 --> 00:31.126
You found my dog!

00:31.127 --> 00:32.836
Sorry his face is all messed up,

00:32.837 --> 00:33.797
but he was already like that
when I got him,

00:33.798 --> 00:35.376
I swear.

00:35.377 --> 00:36.916
Oh, he's supposed to be
like this.

00:36.917 --> 00:38.466
[coughs]

00:38.467 --> 00:41.506
Since my lost dog posters
promised a reward...

00:41.507 --> 00:43.206
- A reward?
- Here ya go.

00:43.207 --> 00:45.506
One hundred dollars,
as promised.

00:47.877 --> 00:49.966
- Thanks! Bye!

could go that high!

01:13.467 --> 01:15.666
Be careful waving
your money around like that.

01:15.667 --> 01:18.836
You might attract
some shady characters.

01:18.837 --> 01:21.876
Hey, thanks, mister!
Name's Cricket Green,

It's, uh...
It's, uh...
I'm John.

- Yes, it is!

01:27.467 --> 01:29.416
You know what's better
than a hundred dollars?

01:29.417 --> 01:30.756
Two hundred dollars.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.086
Wow, that is better!

01:32.087 --> 01:33.546
Gosh, now this
one hundred dollar bill

01:33.547 --> 01:35.006
just looks like junk.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.836
Listen, you give me
your hundred dollars,

01:37.837 --> 01:40.126
I give you a product to sell.

01:40.127 --> 01:43.506
- Product to sell?
- Sell some product,
double your money.

01:43.507 --> 01:45.546
Hmm... "Skull Slimmers."

01:45.547 --> 01:46.876
All right, let's see here...

01:46.877 --> 01:48.706
[grunts] OK...

01:48.707 --> 01:49.707
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:49.708 --> 01:51.296
Oh, it hurts!

01:51.297 --> 01:52.546
That's how you know
it's workin'!

01:52.547 --> 01:53.966
OK. [grunts]

01:53.967 --> 01:55.796
Do you really think
I can sell these?

01:55.797 --> 01:57.966
Listen, most people
aren't as, uh, ya know,

01:57.967 --> 01:59.586
street smart as you and me.

01:59.587 --> 02:00.836
They're easy marks.

02:00.837 --> 02:02.466
Just tell 'em
whatever they wanna hear

02:02.467 --> 02:05.546
and these will
practically sell themselves.

02:05.547 --> 02:07.966
I don't know...
Isn't that kinda like lying?

02:07.967 --> 02:09.836
Nah, that's just
how business works.

02:09.837 --> 02:11.376
So, what do ya say?

02:11.377 --> 02:13.966
Double my money, huh?

02:13.967 --> 02:17.206
- This picture's broken!
- It's a puzzle, Gramma.

02:17.207 --> 02:20.586
So now I'm supposed to do
the picture-maker's job
for him?

02:20.587 --> 02:22.296
[Cricket]
Attention, family!

02:22.297 --> 02:25.966
Get on my good side now,
because I'm about to be rich!

02:25.967 --> 02:28.756
I present to you...
Skull Slimmers!

02:28.757 --> 02:31.416
These babies are gonna
revolutionize heads!

02:31.417 --> 02:32.876
Just, uh, put it on your head

02:32.877 --> 02:34.836
and, uh,
twist the spinny thingy.

02:34.837 --> 02:36.626
Like this?

02:36.627 --> 02:38.006
This product is subpar.

02:38.007 --> 02:39.836
Subpar or not,

02:39.837 --> 02:42.166
I'm gonna sell 'em
for a big fat profit!

02:42.167 --> 02:44.376
Seems a bit dishonest.

02:44.377 --> 02:46.836
Tilly, you just don't understand
how business works.

02:46.837 --> 02:48.166
And you think you do?

02:48.167 --> 02:51.046
Wake up, boy,

02:51.047 --> 02:52.966
- What's that now?
- Bamboozled!

02:52.967 --> 02:55.046
Hoodwinked! Scammed.

02:55.047 --> 02:56.666
How dare you!

02:56.667 --> 02:57.836
I'm Cricket Green!

02:57.837 --> 03:00.706

to buy a new Gramma!

03:05.047 --> 03:06.796
Yeah! And a new sister!

03:06.797 --> 03:10.376
And they'll
appreciate my genius!

03:10.377 --> 03:12.506
I always wanted a sister.

03:12.507 --> 03:14.046
[Cricket]
Citizens of Big City!

03:14.047 --> 03:16.006
Are you tired of hats
that don't fit?

03:16.007 --> 03:18.586
Are you dissatisfied
with the diameter of your dome?

03:18.587 --> 03:20.296
Tiny heads
are the hot new trend!

03:20.297 --> 03:21.506
Don't be the last kid
on the block

03:21.507 --> 03:22.966
with a big ol' noggin!

03:22.967 --> 03:24.416
Benny, I'm looking
in your direction!

03:24.417 --> 03:25.916
People are counting on you

03:25.917 --> 03:27.796
to get their skulls ready
for bikini season!

03:27.797 --> 03:29.506
So... what do ya say?

03:29.507 --> 03:31.666
Uh, no thanks.
This is junk.

03:31.667 --> 03:35.666
I don't appreciate you preying
on my perceived insecurities.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.706
There's no shortcuts
to a slim head!

03:37.707 --> 03:39.876
Only diet and exercise!

03:39.877 --> 03:41.706
Aw, come on!

03:41.707 --> 03:43.586
[Cricket]
Ugh, I don't get it!

03:43.587 --> 03:45.466
Why won't people
buy this garbage?

03:45.467 --> 03:47.506
John made it sound so simple...

03:47.507 --> 03:48.836
Just tell 'em
what they wanna hear

03:48.837 --> 03:52.206
and they'll practically
sell themselves.

03:52.207 --> 03:54.466
Wait!
Is that what I wanted to hear?

03:54.467 --> 03:56.296
Am I the easy mark?

03:56.297 --> 03:57.966
Aw, Gramma was right!

03:57.967 --> 04:00.416
A hundred smackeroos
right down the drain!

04:00.417 --> 04:03.756
Sorry, Katelynn,
I can't afford to go
to the concert with you guys.

04:03.757 --> 04:05.626
Have fun without me.
[sighs]

04:05.627 --> 04:07.506
Money problems are the worst.

04:07.507 --> 04:09.506
Tell me about it! I just
poured a bunch of money

04:09.507 --> 04:10.876
into these Skull Slimmers.

04:10.877 --> 04:13.086
The guy said
they'd sell themselves!

04:13.087 --> 04:15.166
Sell... themselves?

04:15.167 --> 04:16.666
That's what the guy said.

04:16.667 --> 04:17.916
He told me I'd double my money.

04:17.917 --> 04:19.466
Whoa! Wait!

04:19.467 --> 04:21.506
- Can I get in on this?
- Uh, what now?

04:21.507 --> 04:24.336
If I double my money
I can go to that concert
with my friends!

04:24.337 --> 04:27.006
Wait, you want
to buy my Skull Slimmers?

04:27.007 --> 04:29.206
Yeah! How much
for the whole box?

04:29.207 --> 04:31.876
[clears throat] Well,
since we're such good pals,

04:31.877 --> 04:34.086
I'd be willin'
to let them go for...

04:34.087 --> 04:35.706
two hundred dollars?

04:35.707 --> 04:36.836
Sold!

04:36.837 --> 04:38.666
You really think
I can double my money?

04:38.667 --> 04:40.966
I did.

04:40.967 --> 04:44.916
This puzzle's impossible!
What's it even supposed to be?

04:44.917 --> 04:47.706
It's a picture
called "Starless Night."

04:47.707 --> 04:49.086
Why would you pick that?

04:49.087 --> 04:50.876
Oh, family!

04:50.877 --> 04:53.296
Guess who's not a sucker
after all?

04:53.297 --> 04:54.966
I sold the whole lot!

04:54.967 --> 04:57.126
Kiss my filthy bare feet!
Owie!

04:57.127 --> 04:59.966
Who on earth is dumb enough
to buy that junk?

04:59.967 --> 05:02.836
Why, if you must know,
our dear friend Gloria

05:02.837 --> 05:04.796
saw the true value
of Skull Slimmers.

05:04.797 --> 05:06.546
You scammed Gloria?

05:06.547 --> 05:08.256
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

05:08.257 --> 05:11.376
I simply offered her
the same business opportunity

05:11.377 --> 05:12.966
I enjoyed.

05:12.967 --> 05:14.836
- Scam!
- It's not a scam!

05:14.837 --> 05:18.416
Gloria just has to find
someone dumber than her
to buy them!

05:18.417 --> 05:20.336
But then what about that person?

05:20.337 --> 05:22.546
[grunting]
We don't even know them.

05:22.547 --> 05:24.756
Well, be forewarned, Cricket.

05:24.757 --> 05:28.876
The deceitful lifestyle
is a dark and endless void.

05:28.877 --> 05:30.376
Much like this puzzle!

05:30.377 --> 05:32.546
Which we will now have
to start over because of you.

05:32.547 --> 05:35.166
Gah! At least
let me do the edge pieces.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.336
There are none!

05:36.337 --> 05:37.756
Like outer space, this puzzle

05:37.757 --> 05:39.796
is amorphous
and without borders.

05:39.797 --> 05:41.466
[sputters] Gah!

05:41.467 --> 05:43.466
Listen, aren't you interested in

05:43.467 --> 05:44.796
a thinner, lighter skull?

05:44.797 --> 05:46.836
I just wanted a refill!

05:46.837 --> 05:49.756
No, wait! A think skull
is a healthy skull!

05:49.757 --> 05:51.756
Hey, Gloria!
How's the sales going?

05:51.757 --> 05:53.206
Cricket Green!

05:53.207 --> 05:55.876
What pack of lies
did you sell me?

05:55.877 --> 05:59.256
That's a heck of a way
to say good morning
to your li'l business buddy.

05:59.257 --> 06:00.966
Nobody wants
these stupid things.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.966
You totally conned me!

06:02.967 --> 06:04.756
Con is such a strong word.

06:04.757 --> 06:06.876
I never said
people didn't want any...

06:06.877 --> 06:09.086
and you didn't ask
if people did.

06:09.087 --> 06:13.166
So in a way,
didn't we con each other?

06:13.167 --> 06:15.506
- [screaming]
- [grunts]

06:15.507 --> 06:17.376
Gloria, please,
let's just talk this out!

06:17.377 --> 06:18.796
[screaming]

06:18.797 --> 06:20.206
Aah! Stay back, Gloria!

06:20.207 --> 06:21.506
You know, if you put
this kind of energy

06:21.507 --> 06:22.706
into your sales pitch...

06:22.707 --> 06:23.836
- [grunts]
- [screams]

06:23.837 --> 06:24.916
[grunts] Aah!

06:24.917 --> 06:26.666
Come here, Cricket!

06:26.667 --> 06:27.836
[screams]

06:27.837 --> 06:30.046
Oh, man,
Gloria's finally lost it!

06:30.047 --> 06:31.047
[grunts]

06:31.048 --> 06:32.666
Ahh, home free.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.796
- [grunts]
- Somebody save me!

06:34.797 --> 06:35.836
- [grunting]
- [screaming]

06:35.837 --> 06:37.166
Huh?

06:37.167 --> 06:39.546
Cricket Green,
you come back here!

06:39.547 --> 06:41.296
He probably deserves it.

06:41.297 --> 06:43.546
Gloria, no, please!
I'm your friend!

06:43.547 --> 06:46.876
Enough! Cricket,
just give me my money back
and this all stops.

06:46.877 --> 06:48.796
I spent it
already! Gah!

06:48.797 --> 06:50.126
What?

06:50.127 --> 06:51.916
I may, or may not, have decided

06:51.917 --> 06:54.297
to spend the money
you gave me on this.

06:56.047 --> 06:59.796
You spent all of my money
on a wedding cake?

06:59.797 --> 07:01.876
It's just the biggest cake
I could buy.

07:01.877 --> 07:03.966
I don't care
if it's for a wedding.

07:03.967 --> 07:06.626
Then what are those?

07:06.627 --> 07:08.836
Well, excuse me if I wanted
to feel special on my big day.

07:08.837 --> 07:09.757
[grunts]

07:09.758 --> 07:11.706
Cricket,
that two hundred dollars

07:11.707 --> 07:13.916
was from my rent fund.

07:13.917 --> 07:17.706
If I don't make my money back,
I won't be able to pay my rent!

07:17.707 --> 07:20.376
Oh. Gee, I-I didn't know that.

07:20.377 --> 07:21.876
Cake?

07:21.877 --> 07:23.296
Ha.

07:23.297 --> 07:25.167
[sighs]

07:26.757 --> 07:28.416
I'm really sorry, Gloria.

07:28.417 --> 07:30.586
I was just so desperate
not to look like a fool

07:30.587 --> 07:32.006
when I got flimflammed

07:32.007 --> 07:34.836
that I ended up
passin' my burden on to you.

07:34.837 --> 07:38.966
Yeah, well, scamming
someone else isn't the best way
to get out of a scam, dummy.

07:38.967 --> 07:40.706
[gasps] Or is it?

07:40.707 --> 07:42.796
I think I know a way
to get your money back.

07:42.797 --> 07:44.506
But we'll need some help.

07:44.507 --> 07:47.836
Ahh. Really brightens up
the office.

07:47.837 --> 07:49.086
- [Gloria] Hey!
- [gasps]

07:49.087 --> 07:51.166
Would you happen to be John?

07:51.167 --> 07:53.586
Might bees, might beesn't.

07:53.587 --> 07:57.546
I'm Gloria Hightower,
executive VP of acquisitions
for ThingieCorp Incorporated.

07:57.547 --> 07:59.966
Heard you're the man to see
about Skull Slimmers.

07:59.967 --> 08:02.256
Well, you're in luck.
I got tons of 'em!

08:02.257 --> 08:05.206
Hmm... No, this isn't
the model I'm looking for.

08:05.207 --> 08:07.466
- The model? What do you mean?
- Haven't you heard?

08:07.467 --> 08:08.966
There's a new version
of the Skull Slimmer

08:08.967 --> 08:10.296
that makes you super smart.

08:10.297 --> 08:11.756
If you had the new model,

08:11.757 --> 08:13.666
I would have
paid handsomely for them.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.086
Someone's selling Skull Slimmers
that make you smarter?

08:16.087 --> 08:20.546
Boy, I sure was
a real dumb-dumb before
I bought my Skull Slimmer Plus!

08:20.547 --> 08:23.126
I purchased mine
with every dollar I had!

08:23.127 --> 08:24.466
Ho!

08:24.467 --> 08:25.626
Hey, kids,
where'd you get those?

08:25.627 --> 08:26.836
Why, from a young chap

08:26.837 --> 08:29.046
down the alley
on Grantham Avenue.

08:29.047 --> 08:30.706
He bought it!

08:30.707 --> 08:32.796
Yes, well, your acting
has really improved.

08:32.797 --> 08:35.126
Ooh. Huh? It's that kid.

08:35.127 --> 08:39.836
Yes, young man.
Here is my life savings
for the Skull Slimmer.

08:39.837 --> 08:41.166
[whispers] You owe me.

08:41.167 --> 08:42.876
Kid, I gotta hand it to ya.

08:42.877 --> 08:44.466
You were able to turn
that junk I sold ya

08:44.467 --> 08:46.006
into somethin'
people actually want.

08:46.007 --> 08:48.296
But now I'm gonna need
those Skull Slimmers back

08:48.297 --> 08:49.506
with whatever mods
you made to them.

08:49.507 --> 08:51.006
Here's your hundred bucks back.

08:51.007 --> 08:54.916
Sorry, John. The price
has gone up. [slurps]

08:54.917 --> 08:56.546
Fine. Two hundred bucks.

08:56.547 --> 08:58.836
Eh, nah. [slurps]

08:58.837 --> 09:01.756
Let me save us both some time.
What do ya say?

09:01.757 --> 09:04.256
That's a lot of money.

09:04.257 --> 09:07.126
- So we got a deal?
- Absolutely.

09:07.127 --> 09:09.506
Fantastic. Oops.

09:09.507 --> 09:12.296
Whoopsie-daisy.

09:12.297 --> 09:14.006
- Here ya go.
- Thank you, sir.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.966
Pleasure doin' business with ya!

09:15.967 --> 09:17.796
What the...? Hey!

09:17.797 --> 09:19.916
This is just a bunch of napkins!

09:19.917 --> 09:23.006
- Pete never pays full price!
- I thought your name was John!

09:23.007 --> 09:26.206
Yeah, that's what I meant.
John never pays full price!

09:26.207 --> 09:28.086
- [laughs, gasps]
- Stop right there!

09:28.087 --> 09:31.006
Agent William Walker,
Fraudulent Business Division.

09:31.007 --> 09:34.206
-[gasps]
-Just as I suspected.
Skull Slimmers.

09:34.207 --> 09:38.416
Somebody's been selling these
all over town under false claims
that they'll make you smarter.

09:38.417 --> 09:40.876
He sold these to me!
I'm the victim here!

09:40.877 --> 09:44.836
- That true?
- Gee, I'm just a kid,
holdin' a bag of napkins.

09:44.837 --> 09:48.256
Nothin' illegal about holdin' a
bag of napkins, right, Officer?

09:48.257 --> 09:50.506
Checks out.
Hope you like jail!

09:50.507 --> 09:53.586
Wait, wait, wait!
If I get away,
it's all yours.

09:53.587 --> 09:56.416
In all my years on the job,
I've never taken a bribe!

09:56.417 --> 09:58.506
Always wanted to see
what it's like.

09:58.507 --> 10:00.256
Go on, get outta here.

10:00.257 --> 10:01.836
You'll never see me again!

10:01.837 --> 10:04.376
Nice work, "Agent Walker."

10:04.377 --> 10:07.506
Finally,
theater classes pay off!

10:07.507 --> 10:10.546
Yeah! We flim-flammed
the flim-flam man!

10:10.547 --> 10:12.876
- Here. This is for you.
- What?

10:12.877 --> 10:15.586
But, Cricket,
don't you want your share?

10:15.587 --> 10:17.916
Nah, I feel bad
for scamming ya, Gloria.

10:17.917 --> 10:21.626
I even feel kinda bad
for scamming John. Or Pete?

10:21.627 --> 10:24.086
- Yeah, don't.
- You're right. I don't.

10:24.087 --> 10:28.336
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go to a concert
and pay my rent. Whoa!

10:28.337 --> 10:31.167
