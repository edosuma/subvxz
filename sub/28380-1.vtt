WEBVTT

06:17.618 --> 06:20.897
He's gonna sell,
move back to Illinois.

06:25.315 --> 06:26.903
She had my gun.

06:40.330 --> 06:43.195
I'll get supplies
while I'm in town.

06:43.230 --> 06:46.164
It would be good to get stocked
up before winter sets in.

06:48.062 --> 06:50.168
How did she get my gun?

06:54.517 --> 06:56.795
You gotta keep your wits
about you.

06:57.865 --> 06:59.453
Will you do that?

07:12.259 --> 07:13.571
Won't be long.

07:18.092 --> 07:20.025
Couple of days, maybe.

07:53.024 --> 07:53.990
Lizzy!

07:55.060 --> 07:56.648
Lizzy, wake up!

07:57.615 --> 07:59.893
- Isaac?
- Lizzy!

07:59.927 --> 08:01.204
Lizzy!

08:01.239 --> 08:03.172
We gotta get the baby out!

11:15.675 --> 11:17.124
Aah!

13:19.591 --> 13:21.524
We got new neighbors.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.735
They bought
the old Bergson Cabin.

13:26.702 --> 13:28.635
A man and his wife.

13:31.741 --> 13:33.191
Did you invite them over
for dinner?

13:33.226 --> 13:36.160
Of course. Said you wouldn't
take no for an answer.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.197
What are they like?

13:44.789 --> 13:46.480
A little funny.

13:46.515 --> 13:48.793
- Funny?
- Nervous?

13:50.243 --> 13:51.209
Huh.

13:52.797 --> 13:54.730
Better get dinner started.

14:20.618 --> 14:23.414
This is the best food
we've had in weeks.

14:26.451 --> 14:28.350
Lizzy, you'll have to
give my Emma a few lessons

14:28.384 --> 14:30.317
on making a decent meal.

14:35.357 --> 14:36.945
I'd be happy to.

14:46.644 --> 14:47.679
Mm.

14:47.714 --> 14:49.198
You two have a hell
of a lot to do

14:49.233 --> 14:51.166
before the winter sets in.

14:52.684 --> 14:55.791
Everyone said that
this was the best time

14:55.825 --> 14:58.449
of year to get started.

14:58.483 --> 15:02.384
Well, sure, but between getting
that old cabin livable again

15:02.418 --> 15:04.351
and planting your garden..

15:06.112 --> 15:08.390
We'll do what we can to help,
of course.

15:17.986 --> 15:20.264
Maybe I can bring my plow
around tomorrow.

15:20.298 --> 15:22.231
We could at least get your crops
in the ground.

15:24.199 --> 15:27.823
That would be a,
a mighty big help.

15:33.829 --> 15:36.211
- You're German?
- Yes.

15:36.245 --> 15:38.178
I was brought over as a child.

15:39.386 --> 15:40.387
Thank you.

15:46.048 --> 15:48.671
- How were your travels?
- Long.

15:48.706 --> 15:51.881
- Meet anyone?
- Uh, a few people.

15:51.916 --> 15:53.849
A family going to Oklahoma

15:53.883 --> 15:56.817
some men, a reverend.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.960
Is there a church nearby?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.927
Not enough people
around here yet.

16:04.618 --> 16:06.551
- Now many?
- Now..

16:08.553 --> 16:09.520
Four.

18:38.634 --> 18:39.911
Oh, my.

18:41.430 --> 18:44.261
Is the rain always like this?
This intense?

18:44.295 --> 18:45.572
It can be.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.922
Oh, my.

18:50.957 --> 18:53.477
Lizzy, these are beautiful
pieces.

18:53.511 --> 18:56.031
Did you bring them with you
from Saint Louis?

18:56.065 --> 18:58.999
No. Isaac made most
of our furniture.

18:59.966 --> 19:01.209
That's incredible.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.074
Isaac, you are truly talented.

19:07.801 --> 19:10.804
My father made most
of our pieces as well.

19:10.839 --> 19:12.772
He was quite the man.

19:21.401 --> 19:23.334
How long have you been married?

19:24.715 --> 19:26.337
Eight years.

19:26.372 --> 19:27.373
Oh, my.

19:30.238 --> 19:32.171
And no little ones?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.419
- We had a son.
- Wasn't the Lord's will.

19:42.629 --> 19:44.907
It's none of my business,
of course.

19:48.601 --> 19:52.570
Ah, sometimes I don't know
when to stop talking.

19:52.605 --> 19:55.124
And the rain..

19:55.159 --> 19:59.198
Well, I tend to get
a bit restless.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.659
Is that what we look like
to them,

21:21.694 --> 21:24.421
just a little flickering light
in the middle of nowhere?

21:26.457 --> 21:27.424
Perhaps.

21:34.465 --> 21:36.398
What do you think of them?

21:38.158 --> 21:40.299
It's nice to have people close.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.266
Something I've always
longed for.

21:44.820 --> 21:45.787
But?

21:52.483 --> 21:54.416
But it feels odd.

21:56.487 --> 21:59.421
In cities,
strangers stay strangers.

22:02.631 --> 22:05.254
Here we don't have that luxury,
do we?

22:17.128 --> 22:20.062
Come to bed. It's too cold
to have the door open.

24:13.728 --> 24:15.384
Are you sure
they're expecting us?

24:23.254 --> 24:24.255
Come on.

24:34.542 --> 24:37.130
We were very comfortable
in Illinois, you see?

24:37.165 --> 24:39.478
Be sure to hold firmly

24:39.512 --> 24:41.307
and get the root.

24:41.341 --> 24:43.205
Gideon couldn't stand working
for my father

24:43.240 --> 24:46.243
as if it were something
to be ashamed of.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.521
He's not strong like Isaac.

24:49.557 --> 24:50.799
Like you.

24:52.387 --> 24:53.353
Hm.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.880
I'm going to get some water
for the men.

25:02.915 --> 25:03.881
Hm.

25:07.885 --> 25:09.818
Be sure to bring some
for us as well.

25:29.044 --> 25:30.011
Isaac?

26:18.715 --> 26:21.821
I fear I'll never really
get clean again.

26:24.997 --> 26:26.274
Something wrong?

26:28.276 --> 26:32.211
Just getting used
to everything, I think.

26:33.661 --> 26:35.248
That takes time.

26:46.846 --> 26:49.124
This land is funny, you know?

26:50.885 --> 26:52.990
It plays tricks on your mind.

29:55.034 --> 29:56.967
It's Emma, she..

30:01.385 --> 30:02.973
She's not well.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.779
Better to wait outside.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.505
No point in us all getting sick.

30:19.714 --> 30:21.889
It is not that kind of sickness.

30:24.926 --> 30:26.652
We'll wait outside.

30:40.942 --> 30:42.668
Emma?

30:50.641 --> 30:52.022
Emma?

30:54.645 --> 30:57.269
Give us this day
our daily bread.

30:57.303 --> 30:59.858
Forgive us our trespasses.

30:59.892 --> 31:01.721
It's coming for me.

31:03.792 --> 31:05.725
It's coming for me.

31:07.624 --> 31:09.419
It's coming for me.

31:11.179 --> 31:12.871
It's coming for me.

31:18.393 --> 31:19.325
Emma.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.366
It's coming for me.

31:28.024 --> 31:30.060
No one's here but us.

31:31.751 --> 31:34.616
Gideon and Isaac are outside

31:34.651 --> 31:38.655
but in here
it's just you and me.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.381
No.

31:40.415 --> 31:42.831
No. This place is wrong.

31:42.866 --> 31:45.420
We're not supposed to be here.

31:48.768 --> 31:51.254
And now it wants my baby.

31:54.809 --> 31:56.776
You're with a child.

32:03.438 --> 32:04.819
Come on.

32:09.444 --> 32:12.827
Don't touch me! Don't..

32:24.321 --> 32:25.944
Is she pregnant?

32:29.982 --> 32:33.813
Uh, did she say she was?

32:36.885 --> 32:38.611
She needs rest.

32:51.038 --> 32:52.453
Lizzy, what are you doing?

32:52.487 --> 32:54.627
Shh. It's okay.

32:54.662 --> 32:57.216
- You're exhausted.
- I'm not.

32:57.251 --> 33:01.117
I can't rest because
it's coming for me.

33:01.151 --> 33:02.532
No, Lizzy.

33:02.566 --> 33:04.120
Please don't do that.

33:04.810 --> 33:05.914
No.

33:07.019 --> 33:10.298
Lizzy, don't..
Lizzy. Lizzy! Lizzy!

33:10.333 --> 33:11.265
Ah!

33:18.375 --> 33:20.136
Don't do that. Don't do that!

33:21.171 --> 33:22.414
Shh!

33:29.248 --> 33:31.802
Pull your wife out
from under the bed

33:31.837 --> 33:33.459
and tie her to it.

33:52.616 --> 33:53.859
You alright?

33:56.034 --> 33:56.965
Fine.

34:06.251 --> 34:08.770
It was hard enough
when it was just the two of us.

34:10.393 --> 34:13.051
And now we're expected
to look after them as well?

34:15.605 --> 34:17.745
Gideon should take her home.

34:19.471 --> 34:22.612
She's gonna hurt herself
or one of us with her nonsense.

34:26.133 --> 34:27.548
Is she really pregnant?

34:32.932 --> 34:34.693
She thinks she is.

36:25.631 --> 36:27.771
"At length, the worn out anxiety

36:27.806 --> 36:30.360
"she determined to call loudly
for assistance

36:30.395 --> 36:32.811
"from her casement,
and was advancing to it

36:32.845 --> 36:35.745
"when whether the terror of her mind gave her ideal sounds

36:35.779 --> 36:38.057
"or that the real ones did come

36:38.092 --> 36:40.439
she thought footsteps
were ascending.."

36:43.270 --> 36:45.203
Perhaps we should finish
another time.

36:46.963 --> 36:48.447
When you're feeling better.

36:50.656 --> 36:53.521
It's just a person in the book.

36:53.556 --> 36:55.316
It's not a spirit.

37:00.494 --> 37:01.667
I see.

37:03.911 --> 37:05.223
You can keep it.

37:10.124 --> 37:12.195
Have you thought of names
for the baby?

37:12.644 --> 37:14.024
Not yet.

37:25.829 --> 37:27.245
They're coming in for lunch.

37:32.215 --> 37:33.665
I've seen something.

37:35.908 --> 37:39.187
- Just now?
- At night.

37:39.222 --> 37:43.019
I hear it too, whispering.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.746
I've told Gideon
but he doesn't believe me

37:45.780 --> 37:47.506
tells me it's the wind.

37:50.889 --> 37:52.960
- There are many natural --
- It's not.

37:56.653 --> 37:59.794
You remember how many graves
you passed on the way here.

38:05.731 --> 38:07.871
I told Gideon
we should turn back.

38:17.053 --> 38:19.020
I said everyone would be dead
when we get there and there's --

38:19.055 --> 38:20.263
Hush now.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.653
Please don't be unpleasant
in front of the men.

41:09.397 --> 41:10.468
Lizzy?

41:12.435 --> 41:13.401
Isaac.

41:59.896 --> 42:02.520
My help cometh from the Lord,
which made heaven and Earth.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.798
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

42:06.178 --> 42:07.317
The Lord is my keeper

42:07.352 --> 42:09.181
the Lord is thy shade
upon thy right hand.

42:09.216 --> 42:10.804
The sun shall not strike me
by day, nor the moon by night.

42:10.838 --> 42:12.495
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.877
Behold, He who keeps Israel
shall neither slumber nor sleep.

42:14.911 --> 42:15.947
The Lord is my keeper.

42:17.086 --> 42:18.294
...which made heaven and Earth.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.916
He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

42:19.951 --> 42:21.642
He that keepeth thee will not
slumber..

42:33.896 --> 42:34.862
Lizzy?

42:55.158 --> 42:56.125
Lizzy?

43:16.628 --> 43:17.595
Lizzy?

43:22.703 --> 43:24.429
Hey, hey, Lizzy.

43:24.463 --> 43:25.741
English! English!

43:25.775 --> 43:26.742
Lizzy!

43:29.468 --> 43:30.711
You're alright.

43:32.092 --> 43:33.369
You're alright.

43:51.111 --> 43:53.044
I shouldn't have left you alone like this.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.095
What's this?

44:10.130 --> 44:11.407
It's nothing.

44:12.822 --> 44:14.824
Have you been reading it?

44:14.859 --> 44:16.550
I glanced at it.

44:18.172 --> 44:20.105
You don't need to be filling
your head with stuff like this.

44:20.140 --> 44:21.693
You need to rest.

44:24.282 --> 44:26.008
What I saw was real.

44:42.852 --> 44:44.958
This is yours now.

44:44.992 --> 44:46.235
- I don't --
- No.

44:46.269 --> 44:50.032
Promise me you will keep it
by you at all times.

44:50.066 --> 44:53.000
It will protect you.
It will protect our baby.

44:56.245 --> 45:00.180
And the next time you think
you see a demon..

45:02.216 --> 45:03.217
...shoot it.

47:04.338 --> 47:05.615
What?

47:07.341 --> 47:09.619
What do you want now?

47:12.208 --> 47:15.384
Where are you?

47:24.289 --> 47:25.566
Aah!

47:27.741 --> 47:30.157
What must I do to be rid of you?

47:48.175 --> 47:51.938
No! Stop!

48:54.862 --> 48:56.795
Lizzy, where's your gun?

49:00.489 --> 49:04.734
Mara, damner of souls.

49:04.769 --> 49:08.566
Abbadon, the destroyer.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.188
That's enough, Emma.

49:11.465 --> 49:13.157
Succorbenoth..

49:14.744 --> 49:16.263
...bringer of jealous thoughts.

49:16.298 --> 49:17.264
Enough.

49:20.060 --> 49:21.889
Do you want to play a game?

49:22.856 --> 49:23.822
No.

49:24.927 --> 49:26.170
Why not?

49:29.587 --> 49:31.692
You are not well, Emma.

49:33.142 --> 49:35.110
You should rest.

49:35.144 --> 49:36.283
Think of your baby.

49:36.318 --> 49:38.423
I am, Lizzy.

49:39.252 --> 49:41.288
Elizabeth.

49:41.323 --> 49:42.910
Little lady Macklin.

49:44.291 --> 49:47.398
I want you to know
what I'm going to name the baby.

49:48.675 --> 49:50.263
And what's that?

49:51.195 --> 49:53.921
I want you to guess.

49:53.956 --> 49:55.889
I do not want to play
a game, Emma.

49:57.270 --> 49:59.548
Three guesses
for if it's a girl.

50:01.895 --> 50:02.861
Mary?

50:03.966 --> 50:05.450
- No.
- Sarah?

50:05.485 --> 50:07.107
Mnm-mnm.

50:07.142 --> 50:08.729
Do you want a hint?

50:12.630 --> 50:15.391
It's one of two names
in this room.

50:16.634 --> 50:17.773
Emma.

50:18.670 --> 50:19.844
Elizabeth.

50:21.639 --> 50:22.605
Why?

50:24.159 --> 50:27.093
Because you have been such
a strong person.

50:28.473 --> 50:31.062
I would not have survived
without you.

50:38.552 --> 50:40.658
Three guesses for if it's a boy.

50:44.075 --> 50:45.007
Gideon.

50:46.077 --> 50:47.009
No.

50:51.324 --> 50:52.325
Samuel?

50:54.292 --> 50:56.225
Lizzy, I'm not a monster.

50:58.917 --> 51:00.195
One more guess.

51:01.092 --> 51:02.887
No hints this time?

51:02.921 --> 51:04.854
I don't think you need one.

51:11.723 --> 51:13.829
- Isaac.
- Yes.

51:17.315 --> 51:18.282
Why?

51:19.006 --> 51:20.594
You know why.

51:22.976 --> 51:27.118
Mesimer,
prince of pestilence.

51:27.153 --> 51:31.502
Succorbenoth,
bringer of jealous thoughts.

51:33.400 --> 51:37.508
Mara, damner of souls.

51:39.613 --> 51:41.063
Babael..

51:42.927 --> 51:44.860
...keeper of graves.

52:51.892 --> 52:54.205
For I have never,
not in my entire life

52:54.240 --> 52:56.690
seen anything like this land.

52:56.725 --> 52:59.210
The wind never stops.

52:59.245 --> 53:01.488
Gideon has barely been able
to do his part

53:01.523 --> 53:03.525
in making this place livable.

53:03.559 --> 53:07.218
My only comfort is the time
I get to spend with Isaac.

53:07.253 --> 53:10.359
He puts in extra hours
in the long days here

53:10.394 --> 53:12.327
away from Lizzy.

53:12.361 --> 53:15.157
I am pregnant. I know it.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.677
I can feel it inside of me.

53:17.711 --> 53:19.023
Our baby.

53:38.353 --> 53:41.908
Succorbenoth,
bringer of jealous thoughts.

53:41.942 --> 53:44.186
Babael, keeper of graves.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.775
Abbadon, the destroyer.

53:46.809 --> 53:49.398
Mesimer, prince of pestilence.

53:49.433 --> 53:52.367
Mara, damner of souls..

54:19.014 --> 54:20.187
Isaac..

54:21.499 --> 54:23.467
...I'm scared.

54:23.501 --> 54:25.158
You're doing fine.

54:25.192 --> 54:26.366
I wanna die.

54:51.667 --> 54:52.944
It's a boy.

54:53.842 --> 54:55.119
It's a boy.

55:07.614 --> 55:09.685
Why isn't the baby crying?

55:15.484 --> 55:17.831
Why isn't the baby crying?

55:20.351 --> 55:21.835
Isaac?

55:25.149 --> 55:28.808
- Isaac, why isn't..
- You stay right there, Lizzy.

55:30.948 --> 55:32.501
He should be crying.

56:13.887 --> 56:15.233
Samuel.

56:19.065 --> 56:20.860
It's a good name, Lizzy.

57:11.531 --> 57:13.430
He'll use it
more than I will.

59:40.024 --> 59:43.062
I.. I am so sorry.

59:43.096 --> 59:44.477
Reverend.

59:54.107 --> 59:55.592
I do beg pardon.

59:57.801 --> 1:00:01.080
I haven't had much in the way
of real food for weeks.

1:00:08.535 --> 1:00:10.952
You out here alone?

1:00:13.230 --> 1:00:17.027
I came across an empty cabin
about a mile east of here.

1:00:18.304 --> 1:00:19.339
Kin?

1:00:21.341 --> 1:00:22.273
No.

1:00:26.899 --> 1:00:28.901
Well, I've been traveling
a while..

1:00:31.213 --> 1:00:32.732
...spreadin' the word of God.

1:00:34.009 --> 1:00:37.150
I don't suspect
God has much business out here.

1:00:41.672 --> 1:00:44.399
No longer a God-fearing woman,
hmm?

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:10.736
Mrs. Macklin,
thank you so much.

1:01:10.770 --> 1:01:13.980
You have been
more than hospitable.

1:01:15.292 --> 1:01:17.121
You shouldn't be out at night.

1:01:17.156 --> 1:01:20.228
The Harper cabin is empty
and you'll be comfortable there.

1:01:21.091 --> 1:01:22.851
You can head out in the morning.

1:01:25.509 --> 1:01:27.338
You and your family..

1:01:28.305 --> 1:01:30.238
...will be in my prayers.

1:01:31.446 --> 1:01:35.415
Reverend, don't answer the door
for anyone..

1:01:35.450 --> 1:01:36.796
...not after dark.

1:01:37.728 --> 1:01:39.419
Not even for me.

1:01:44.114 --> 1:01:45.218
Goodnight.

1:01:45.253 --> 1:01:46.599
Goodnight.

1:02:27.122 --> 1:02:31.230
Mrs. Macklin? There's something out here. Please!

1:02:32.127 --> 1:02:34.751
Quick! Mrs. Macklin!

1:02:35.924 --> 1:02:37.270
Mrs. Macklin, quick!

1:02:37.305 --> 1:02:40.446
There's somethin' out here,
please!

1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:42.413
Move to the window
so I can see you.

1:02:42.448 --> 1:02:43.760
Alright.

1:02:49.524 --> 1:02:51.698
Inside, quickly!

1:02:57.843 --> 1:03:00.949
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

1:03:06.921 --> 1:03:08.508
What is that thing?

1:03:10.752 --> 1:03:12.823
I don't know.

1:03:12.858 --> 1:03:15.067
It's been here
for as long as we have.

1:03:17.034 --> 1:03:18.587
Why did you stay?

1:03:20.486 --> 1:03:22.281
My husband doesn't believe me.

1:03:22.315 --> 1:03:24.386
He -- he hasn't seen it?

1:03:26.285 --> 1:03:28.839
But sure he..
When Emma saw it..

1:03:35.052 --> 1:03:36.329
Oh, no.

1:03:41.024 --> 1:03:42.715
I've said too much.

1:03:46.788 --> 1:03:47.927
Pity.

1:03:49.584 --> 1:03:53.588
I was havin' such a good time!

1:07:59.282 --> 1:08:01.284
Oh, hey, Lizzy!

1:08:07.600 --> 1:08:08.601
Lizzy?

1:08:15.091 --> 1:08:16.264
Lizzy?

1:08:22.236 --> 1:08:23.375
It's me.

1:08:24.859 --> 1:08:25.998
It's me.

1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:31.590
Hey.

1:08:34.765 --> 1:08:36.767
Look at me. It's alright.

1:08:39.563 --> 1:08:41.082
It's alright.

1:08:41.117 --> 1:08:42.980
Okay. It's alright.

1:08:43.878 --> 1:08:45.776
Hey.

1:08:45.811 --> 1:08:48.676
What happened? You hurt?

1:08:52.542 --> 1:08:55.338
I saw the reverend
on the way home.

1:08:58.134 --> 1:09:00.170
He said you were
very hospitable.

1:09:03.484 --> 1:09:04.416
No.

1:09:17.705 --> 1:09:18.913
Hey.

1:09:22.261 --> 1:09:23.400
Lizzy?

1:10:36.749 --> 1:10:38.648
You should have woke me.

1:10:43.135 --> 1:10:46.000
That is probably the longest
sleep you've had in a while.

1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:52.696
All the men are gone, but, uh..

1:10:54.353 --> 1:10:55.906
...I brought you something.

1:11:20.586 --> 1:11:23.140
Good Lord, Lizzy,
you've gone pale.

1:11:28.180 --> 1:11:30.872
I just wasn't expecting
to see anything of theirs again.

1:11:32.702 --> 1:11:34.013
They're just books.

1:11:38.742 --> 1:11:39.881
Besides..

1:11:41.366 --> 1:11:43.437
...they'll help us pass
the winter.

1:11:45.301 --> 1:11:46.750
Occupy our minds.

1:11:48.580 --> 1:11:50.236
Occupy my mind?

1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.312
Let's get it inside.

1:12:06.252 --> 1:12:09.773
"I demand a creature
of another sex

1:12:09.808 --> 1:12:12.742
"but as hideous as myself.

1:12:12.776 --> 1:12:16.090
"It is true
we shall be monsters

1:12:16.124 --> 1:12:19.093
"cut off from all the world.

1:12:19.127 --> 1:12:20.922
"But on that account

1:12:20.957 --> 1:12:23.615
"we shall be more attached
to one another.

1:12:26.065 --> 1:12:29.655
"Our lives will not be happy..

1:12:29.690 --> 1:12:31.519
"...but they will be harmless

1:12:31.554 --> 1:12:35.074
"and free from the misery
I now feel.

1:12:36.006 --> 1:12:38.319
"Oh, my creator, make me happy.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:43.289
"Let me feel gratitude
towards you for one benefit.

1:12:43.324 --> 1:12:45.775
"Let me see that I excite
the sympathy

1:12:45.809 --> 1:12:48.225
of some existing thing.."

1:14:07.719 --> 1:14:09.790
Oh, it's getting cold.

1:14:09.824 --> 1:14:12.137
Maybe you should pull out
the extra blankets.

1:14:16.624 --> 1:14:19.006
I burned this.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:22.112
- It was Emma's.
- She was reading this?

1:14:23.113 --> 1:14:25.322
She was seeing something.

1:14:31.156 --> 1:14:32.502
Lizzy..

1:14:35.332 --> 1:14:37.507
- There is something out there.
- Enough.

1:14:37.542 --> 1:14:39.129
Just enough. Enough.

1:14:39.164 --> 1:14:40.545
I really thought
we were past this.

1:14:40.579 --> 1:14:43.237
Nothing, nothing good can come

1:14:43.271 --> 1:14:44.894
from reading this nonsense.

1:14:46.482 --> 1:14:48.000
Look what happened
to Emma, she took

1:14:48.035 --> 1:14:50.624
her own life,
for Christ's sake!

1:14:50.658 --> 1:14:52.660
I'm not so sure she did.

1:14:58.390 --> 1:14:59.805
No, Lizzy.

1:15:05.086 --> 1:15:07.088
You really shouldn't be out
after dark.

1:15:07.123 --> 1:15:09.574
Y -- you don't know
what's out there.

1:15:09.608 --> 1:15:12.577
There is nothing out there!

1:15:14.026 --> 1:15:16.235
Oh, God. Isaac, please!

1:15:16.270 --> 1:15:17.478
Where's your gun, Lizzy?

1:17:39.344 --> 1:17:40.863
Isaac.

1:17:45.281 --> 1:17:47.076
How long have you had this?

1:17:55.153 --> 1:17:57.086
It's not safe here.

1:18:03.471 --> 1:18:04.921
Isaac.

1:18:08.925 --> 1:18:11.238
Isaac, we have to leave.

1:18:11.272 --> 1:18:13.033
We have to get out.

1:18:14.931 --> 1:18:17.693
How did she get your gun, Lizzy?

1:18:19.315 --> 1:18:21.386
It doesn't matter.

1:18:21.420 --> 1:18:24.354
- Emma?
- Lizzy!

1:18:27.150 --> 1:18:29.566
Isaac, I don't care
what happened.

1:18:31.603 --> 1:18:33.570
- We need to go home.
- I told Gideon.

1:18:33.605 --> 1:18:35.434
I told Gideon
that he should leave

1:18:35.469 --> 1:18:37.402
and that he
shouldn't come back.

1:18:38.714 --> 1:18:40.336
What did you do?

1:18:40.370 --> 1:18:44.305
Isaac...please untie me.

1:18:44.340 --> 1:18:47.584
You don't understand
what's happening..

1:18:47.619 --> 1:18:49.794
...but I do, I've seen it.

1:18:51.796 --> 1:18:54.488
Isaac! Please untie me!

1:18:54.522 --> 1:18:58.216
- She was pregnant.
- Oh, God, no.

1:18:58.250 --> 1:19:02.530
It's just gonna be me,
you, Isaac..

1:19:04.498 --> 1:19:07.294
- You killed her.
- No. It wasn't me.

1:19:07.328 --> 1:19:08.744
It was.

1:19:37.427 --> 1:19:38.704
Isaac.

1:19:42.122 --> 1:19:43.537
There's something here.

1:19:49.439 --> 1:19:50.578
Lizzy!

1:19:56.343 --> 1:19:58.138
It's right there.

1:19:58.172 --> 1:20:00.002
There is nothing!

1:20:00.036 --> 1:20:01.175
Lizzy.

1:20:03.764 --> 1:20:04.903
No.

1:21:34.959 --> 1:21:36.581
Good morning.

1:21:36.615 --> 1:21:38.445
Morning, reverend.

1:21:38.479 --> 1:21:39.895
How was your journey?

1:21:41.310 --> 1:21:43.070
Fine. Thank you.

1:21:43.933 --> 1:21:46.246
I have something for you.

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.903
I came prepared.

1:21:49.283 --> 1:21:51.596
You can never be too prepared.

1:21:52.873 --> 1:21:55.772
The Lord's blessing
be with you.

1:21:55.807 --> 1:21:57.326
And with you.

1:22:13.929 --> 1:22:15.723
There's something out there.

1:22:19.417 --> 1:22:21.488
There is nothing out there.

1:22:23.110 --> 1:22:25.733
This land, there's something
wrong with it.

1:22:27.943 --> 1:22:31.222
Your mind is looking for things to worry about.

1:22:33.155 --> 1:22:34.742
First baby and all.

1:22:44.994 --> 1:22:46.927
It's just you and me.
