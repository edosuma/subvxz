01:51.542 --> 01:53.250
<i>Before we begin, I have a question.</i>

01:53.333 --> 01:54.583
<i>Who here is an economics major?</i>

01:56.208 --> 01:58.625
Okay. You all know
I'm a popular professor, right?

01:59.708 --> 02:02.292
There are so many students
who want to take my class,

02:02.875 --> 02:04.750
but I can't accept all of them.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.417
Can you drop the class for them?

02:07.500 --> 02:10.042
- Excuse me?
- Drop my class.

02:11.125 --> 02:12.250
- That's a bit...
- I mean,

02:12.333 --> 02:15.583
can't you leave for students
with other majors to take this class?

02:15.667 --> 02:18.167
If I drop this class,
I can't enroll again.

02:19.167 --> 02:20.208
Right. Okay.

02:21.167 --> 02:22.667
All right, think about this.

02:22.750 --> 02:25.708
As you see, young musicians and artists

02:26.000 --> 02:28.417
who led the so-called "Hongdae Culture"

02:28.500 --> 02:31.875
were chased out of the area
when Hongdae became popular.

02:32.667 --> 02:34.667
They moved to Yeonnam-dong,

02:34.750 --> 02:36.375
but had to relocate when the rent rose.

02:36.458 --> 02:38.833
When all seemed good at Mangwon-dong,

02:38.917 --> 02:41.250
they were chased out again
because of Starbucks.

02:41.917 --> 02:44.375
All right, how do we solve this problem?

02:52.958 --> 02:53.958
Hello.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.375
Isn't that too thin?

02:57.083 --> 02:59.208
It's 50pi, so it'll be strong enough
for most things.

02:59.708 --> 03:02.042
Do you know how much the projector weighs?

03:02.833 --> 03:05.250
A 20,000 lumens projector
weighs 47 kilograms.

03:05.333 --> 03:07.833
With the brackets, it weighs 52 kilograms.

03:08.042 --> 03:10.667
It's how much I weighed this morning.
Should I step on it?

03:10.750 --> 03:13.042
We checked that already.

03:14.792 --> 03:17.125
Everything will be ready on time, ma'am.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.833
The quality is what's important.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yes, ma'am.

03:23.583 --> 03:24.958
Ms. Min, what is this?

03:25.042 --> 03:26.083
It's Zhou Zhang.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.125
Zhou Zhang? I thought we dropped that.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.333
I talked with the director about this.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.250
Isn't that enough, then?

03:34.208 --> 03:35.333
Good work.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.833
Director.

03:54.917 --> 03:56.083
{\an8}DIRECTOR LEE HWA-LAN.

03:56.167 --> 03:59.583
Wouldn't it be better to just go to court
than give up the ranch?

03:59.667 --> 04:02.042
You can request alimony separately,

04:02.125 --> 04:03.917
so that would be the best choice, but...

04:04.583 --> 04:06.958
I'm absolutely sure
Yong-seok is cheating on me,

04:07.042 --> 04:09.792
but he doesn't have any loose ends.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.458
- What is it?
- I saw that a Zhou Zhang came in.

04:15.542 --> 04:18.208
Zhou Zhang is nice. People would go crazy
for one of his pieces.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.625
We already chose the pieces
for our new artists exhibition,

04:20.708 --> 04:22.208
and the press announced it already.

04:22.792 --> 04:23.792
Really?

04:23.958 --> 04:25.625
I guess we'll need a new article.

04:26.042 --> 04:29.458
Director, the reopening exhibit is about
showing our center's direction, and...

04:29.542 --> 04:32.000
So why is the vice director having issues,

04:32.083 --> 04:34.042
when I find the direction fine?

04:36.542 --> 04:38.667
Just stick to your job.

04:39.917 --> 04:44.208
You must think you'll become the director
as soon as I get promoted to chairwoman,

04:44.292 --> 04:46.125
but not anyone can be a director.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.083
Did you know Zhou Zhang was coming in?

04:55.875 --> 04:58.667
I just heard about it a minute ago.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.500
{\an8}The reporter, Ms. Yoon, called.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.583
{\an8}Are you going to Alt Space tonight?

05:05.167 --> 05:08.583
{\an8}All the artists who worked
on the reopening exhibit are coming.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.750
But the problem is that we can't just

05:13.833 --> 05:16.125
suppress the housing market.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.500
That is the pressing problem with reform.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.833
Professor, when will
the reform take place?

05:20.917 --> 05:23.542
People are about to get evicted,
and you're saying

05:23.625 --> 05:25.167
they should just wait until then?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.375
Wait a minute.

05:26.458 --> 05:30.333
It really is a problem
that rent has risen to unbearable levels.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.958
Well then,

05:32.042 --> 05:34.083
is there any practical way
to resolve this?

05:36.542 --> 05:37.917
Professor Jang?

05:39.292 --> 05:40.417
They should pay the rent.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.333
What?

05:41.417 --> 05:43.667
They should pay the rent.

05:43.750 --> 05:47.208
Are all landlords evil people?

05:47.292 --> 05:49.625
They have a chance to make profit
through real estate,

05:49.708 --> 05:51.667
How can we stop them from raising rent?

05:52.292 --> 05:54.292
I get what you're saying, but the thing is

05:54.375 --> 05:57.542
that in reality,
paying rent is extremely difficult.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.083
We can help them pay.

05:59.167 --> 06:00.542
How would that be possible?

06:01.167 --> 06:05.250
A civic bank could offer low-interest
and long-term loans

06:05.333 --> 06:08.083
to small business owners
to help them pay rent.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.083
Professor Jang.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.583
Small business owners
are getting chased out right now,

06:13.667 --> 06:16.750
and we're having a serious discussion here

06:16.833 --> 06:19.375
about how to protect
the rights of our citizens.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.898
- This far-fetched...
- You're right.

06:21.917 --> 06:23.125
Tenants are citizens.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.958
But landlords are citizens as well.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.250
Of course, there is a difference
in their wealth,

06:29.333 --> 06:32.208
but both are citizens
that require protection.

06:32.833 --> 06:35.083
We have to focus on mutual benefits
while coexisting.

06:35.167 --> 06:39.875
All politicians think about is which side
they should support to get more votes.

06:40.083 --> 06:42.667
Isn't that why they can't find
a practical solution?

06:44.417 --> 06:45.417
He's pretty harsh.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.500
- Isn't he charismatic?
- Our citizens

06:47.583 --> 06:50.042
achieved things
that the US and Finland couldn't.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.958
Forbidding desire is totalitarianism.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.333
And letting desires go wild

06:57.417 --> 06:58.625
is laissez-faire.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.042
But encouraging reasonable levels
of desire,

07:02.500 --> 07:05.000
is the responsibility of a civic society.

07:05.083 --> 07:07.208
Oh, thank you.

07:07.292 --> 07:09.208
- Thank you.
- I'll see you at school.

07:09.292 --> 07:11.083
- All right.
- Take care.

07:19.292 --> 07:20.667
Excuse me, Professor.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.583
Do you remember me?

07:24.125 --> 07:25.125
Were you my student?

07:25.625 --> 07:28.875
I took your class before,
"The Birth of a Civic Capitalist."

07:29.083 --> 07:30.875
I didn't know I'd see you again like this.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.970
This is how we meet
after students graduate.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.542
You mentioned during class
how a civic bank was necessary,

07:36.625 --> 07:37.945
and you're actually doing it now.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.667
We'll have to see. Thank you for today.

07:41.875 --> 07:43.458
I'll go to the rally tomorrow.

07:43.708 --> 07:44.750
Good luck, sir.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.792
- I'll get going now.
- Bye.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.875
<i>Ma'am, you really came.</i>

08:17.083 --> 08:19.083
<i>I didn't think you'd come.</i>

08:19.167 --> 08:22.083
I heard the rising artist exhibit
got cancelled.

08:22.167 --> 08:24.333
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.125
I already told everyone about it.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.542
We're here today
to congratulate the opening of Alt Space,

08:28.625 --> 08:30.083
- so hold it.
- I trusted you.

08:30.167 --> 08:32.000
Cheers to Alt Space!

08:32.082 --> 08:33.667
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

08:33.750 --> 08:35.832
I wanted to do something like this too.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.082
Congratulations.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.667
You know Zio Shin, right?
He was invited to the Documenta.

08:47.750 --> 08:50.417
Yes. I thought he was in Paris, though.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.083
Right. He's just here for a short while.

08:53.708 --> 08:55.833
It's something about
a dance collaboration.

08:56.208 --> 08:58.208
Why? Do you want an introduction?

08:58.458 --> 09:00.000
It's fine, maybe later.

09:26.417 --> 09:28.708
The weather was nice,
but it's raining now.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.333
"Alternative space."

09:33.500 --> 09:35.875
That's a really tacky name.

09:36.667 --> 09:40.000
But it takes quite a lot of courage
to call it "alternative" himself.

09:41.708 --> 09:44.292
Is it true? About Zhou Zhang?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.042
I need your help, Ms. Yoon.

09:47.375 --> 09:49.917
We're buying three pieces from him.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.708
One is getting sent to a Paris auction.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.792
- The sponsor?
- Hwayoung Group.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.583
Another conglomerate story?

09:55.667 --> 09:58.542
It's a bit clichÃ©,
and there's no evidence.

09:59.250 --> 10:00.667
How about abuse of power?

10:01.042 --> 10:02.792
They suddenly backed out of the contract,

10:02.875 --> 10:04.375
and they took away opportunities

10:04.458 --> 10:06.458
from local artists
just to invite a foreign one.

10:08.958 --> 10:11.542
So you won't even drink
with losers like us?

10:11.625 --> 10:12.958
How ridiculous.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.875
If you're a mysterious artist who doesn't
even do interviews, why are you here?

10:16.958 --> 10:20.000
You should greet a senior artist
if you see one, you shit.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.917
- What's up with you?
- You know

10:22.000 --> 10:23.976
- that I'm not usually like this.
- Of course, I do.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.208
It's okay. I'll take him.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.625
- Stop. Come here.
- How could he do that to me?

10:27.708 --> 10:31.167
- Come on.
- I was just...

10:31.250 --> 10:32.917
- I didn't mean...
- Let's go, come on.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.417
What an asshole.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.000
<i>The past love.</i>

10:44.083 --> 10:47.542
<i>Becomes a thorn.</i>

10:47.792 --> 10:51.708
<i>That digs into me.</i>

10:52.958 --> 10:56.042
<i>I ask it to leave.</i>

10:56.250 --> 10:59.042
<i>To leave for good.</i>

10:59.208 --> 11:03.083
<i>But still, it keeps bothering me.</i>

11:03.167 --> 11:05.527
Don't you know women hate
men singing that in karaoke rooms?

11:06.625 --> 11:08.500
That's why I'm singing it at home.

11:09.042 --> 11:14.708
<i>I missed you like crazy.</i>

11:15.708 --> 11:16.708
Why did you do that?

11:16.833 --> 11:19.353
If you sing with that on,
you'll get wrinkles around your mouth.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.167
Gosh.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.833
Maybe I should just quit work.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.167
What is it this time?

11:29.917 --> 11:33.167
Those who do whatever they want
with their money... I hope they die.

11:34.042 --> 11:35.417
That Ms. Min.

11:35.625 --> 11:38.167
She'd be nothing
if it weren't for her money.

11:39.625 --> 11:43.167
While I was looking at Chun Kyung-ja's
pieces on a calendar,

11:43.250 --> 11:46.833
that bitch had the real pieces
hung on her bedroom wall. Unbelievable.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.500
Are they expensive?

11:48.833 --> 11:50.167
Should I buy one for you?

11:51.208 --> 11:52.542
Can you afford that?

11:56.500 --> 11:59.667
Hey, I'm doing pretty well.
I was on TV again today.

12:04.792 --> 12:07.083
Weren't you just assisting
Professor Lee again?

12:07.750 --> 12:09.208
It's not like that.

12:09.958 --> 12:12.458
No one helps me out as much as he does.

12:12.708 --> 12:15.000
I heard he's quitting to go into politics.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.625
That's why I should stick with him.

12:17.375 --> 12:19.695
- You want to do politics, too?
- There's no reason not to.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.833
If the time comes,
and if there's an opportunity.

12:23.708 --> 12:24.708
I believe

12:25.000 --> 12:27.708
you won't lose an opportunity
if it comes to you.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.458
But I...

12:31.125 --> 12:33.125
I prefer a man who makes a chance,

12:33.292 --> 12:34.958
not a man who waits for one.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.667
Someone who makes their opportunities...

13:23.083 --> 13:24.292
You're here.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.542
Yes, hello.

13:28.167 --> 13:31.292
Do you know how much
one cc of this boy's semen costs?

13:32.583 --> 13:34.958
It costs the same as a one-carat diamond.

13:35.708 --> 13:38.583
Whether it's a person or a horse,
the bloodline is important.

13:42.375 --> 13:46.583
PRESIDENT'S AWARD HAN YONG-SEOK

13:46.667 --> 13:48.500
GRAND ART EXHIBITION OF KOREA

13:57.583 --> 13:59.292
So you've visited Germany.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.625
Was it nice there?

14:01.625 --> 14:03.500
Nowhere is like how it used to be before.

14:03.583 --> 14:04.750
Nothing moves me.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.125
But still, you're amazing.

14:07.417 --> 14:10.000
You make art even while you're so busy.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.625
It's not time that bothers me,
it's my lack of physical energy.

14:14.875 --> 14:19.292
I should do a piece with you sometime.

14:22.500 --> 14:24.542
"Abuse of power from large galleries.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.500
Local artists cannot find places
to exhibit their pieces."

14:28.583 --> 14:30.750
This article was your doing, wasn't it?

14:31.958 --> 14:34.667
It's fine since the name "Mirae"
wasn't mentioned, right?

14:34.750 --> 14:36.292
Don't underestimate Hwa-lan.

14:37.125 --> 14:40.417
She's not the director
just for show, you know.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.458
Please let me become the director.

14:49.958 --> 14:52.667
You want the director's seat?

14:54.750 --> 14:56.042
What's in it for me?

14:56.125 --> 14:58.667
A partner you can trust.

14:58.750 --> 15:02.208
I'm a pretty good partner.
Trust me with that role.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.917
If Hwa-lan heads the foundation,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.042
wouldn't you become
the next director anyway?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.750
You're the one who gets to decide.

15:14.708 --> 15:17.958
{\an8}Out with conglomerates that kill

15:18.042 --> 15:19.208
small businesses!

15:19.292 --> 15:21.750
- Conglomerates, back off!
- Conglomerates, back off!

15:21.833 --> 15:23.917
Get rid of political corruption

15:24.000 --> 15:25.875
and help the dreams of citizens!

15:25.958 --> 15:28.583
- Get rid of corruption!
- Get rid of corruption!

15:29.875 --> 15:31.125
Professor Jang.

15:32.375 --> 15:35.375
Sir, you're here again.

15:36.083 --> 15:37.708
Why don't we have a drink later?

15:38.333 --> 15:40.167
Could I borrow your lighter?

15:41.042 --> 15:42.250
Here you go.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.000
Hold on, I'll get you some coffee.

15:46.083 --> 15:48.667
- Back off!
- Back off!

15:48.750 --> 15:50.708
When the hell will the reform be in place?

15:50.792 --> 15:53.583
We want practical measures!

15:53.667 --> 15:55.667
- Practical measures!
- Practical measures!

15:55.750 --> 15:59.042
Protect the rights
of small business owners!

15:59.125 --> 16:00.333
Citizens...

16:02.000 --> 16:03.250
Fire!

16:03.333 --> 16:04.917
He's on fire!

16:06.667 --> 16:08.792
Someone help! He's on fire!

16:29.750 --> 16:31.708
Oh, no. What do we do?

16:31.833 --> 16:33.292
Oh, my goodness.

16:33.958 --> 16:36.875
Sir, are you okay? Sir!

16:39.833 --> 16:41.042
He saved him.

16:42.875 --> 16:44.958
Is Ms. Lee still the same?

16:45.875 --> 16:47.583
She's still clueless as always.

16:47.958 --> 16:49.708
Except when she bullies me.

16:50.042 --> 16:53.708
It's amazing that you're still working
for her with your temper.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.250
What else can I do?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.708
I have to earn money and pay off my debt.

16:57.875 --> 16:59.375
Why do you live like that?

16:59.458 --> 17:01.042
You just had to go to Gangnam,

17:01.125 --> 17:03.292
even if you could only afford
to rent a house.

17:06.541 --> 17:09.000
Your fibroids grew.
Let's check again next month.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.083
You're at the age where premature
menopause isn't uncommon.

17:12.666 --> 17:14.958
Hey, I'm only 37.

17:15.041 --> 17:18.541
That's why I'm saying this.
37 isn't a young age.

17:19.041 --> 17:20.750
It won't matter if you don't want a baby.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.125
I'm healthy, and I'll have a baby
after some time.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.583
Here.

17:29.292 --> 17:31.458
- How is Tae-jun?
- He's busy.

17:31.667 --> 17:32.958
He must be doing well.

17:33.042 --> 17:35.292
He bragged that he was on TV yesterday.

17:38.292 --> 17:41.417
- <i>During a rally about the rights...</i>
- He does appear on TV often.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.750
<i>A man of age 73 attempted to burn
himself to death.</i>

17:44.875 --> 17:47.208
<i>Professor Jang Tae-jun,
who was at the site,</i>

17:47.292 --> 17:50.292
<i>threw himself over the man to save him.</i>

17:53.917 --> 17:56.417
Won't it leave a scar?
What did the doctor say?

17:56.500 --> 17:58.333
It's fine as long as
I take good care of it.

17:58.417 --> 18:00.333
Don't do things like that again.

18:00.417 --> 18:03.708
Even if we ever break up,
I really wouldn't want to be a widow.

18:04.667 --> 18:05.958
That's a bit harsh.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.875
I just don't want you to get hurt
for some stranger's sake.

18:08.958 --> 18:11.417
He wasn't some stranger, I knew him.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.208
That doesn't mean you really know him.

18:13.375 --> 18:14.875
Always so meddlesome...

18:15.292 --> 18:18.083
How could I just stand there
and do nothing in that situation?

18:24.833 --> 18:25.875
Hello?

18:27.708 --> 18:28.917
Yes, that's right.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.000
The Republican Party?

18:44.750 --> 18:47.542
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR THE PEOPLE

18:50.625 --> 18:53.667
HEAD OF PARTY'S OFFICE

19:02.583 --> 19:04.292
<i>Is your hand okay?</i>

19:04.375 --> 19:06.125
I hope you weren't hurt badly.

19:06.458 --> 19:08.917
Oh, it's fine.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.292
What do you think is the value
of a conservative party?

19:14.167 --> 19:15.000
Excuse me?

19:15.083 --> 19:16.583
It's practicality.

19:17.583 --> 19:20.833
Practical policies that will help
improve the lives of citizens.

19:21.750 --> 19:24.083
The civic bank idea, Professor Jang.

19:24.917 --> 19:26.917
I was very touched.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.458
Thank you.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.875
Let's work together
to make that civic bank.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.583
And we'd like you

19:38.125 --> 19:40.708
to run in the election for our Party.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.292
You have great insight, sir.

19:46.917 --> 19:51.417
It's not easy even for a presidential
candidate to be this popular online.

19:52.542 --> 19:54.583
What do you say, Professor Jang?

20:02.917 --> 20:06.250
If you give me the opportunity,
I'll do my best.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.917
I'll look forward to working with you.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.333
Sure, thank you.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.208
The piece you mentioned last time,

20:19.292 --> 20:21.875
I got information that it's going to be
auctioned in Hong Kong.

20:24.042 --> 20:25.375
You're buying another piece?

20:25.750 --> 20:27.875
Ju-yeong likes Hopper's works.

20:28.167 --> 20:31.292
Wow, he's different from kids these days.

20:31.458 --> 20:33.500
He looks just like his father,

20:33.625 --> 20:35.750
but his artistic sense is just like mine.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.458
You have to be born with artistic sense.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.208
About 800 million
would do it, right, Curator Oh?

20:44.458 --> 20:47.708
Oh, have you forgotten
that she's the vice director now?

20:48.167 --> 20:49.875
She's been so for a while.

20:49.958 --> 20:53.042
I don't see what the difference is.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.458
Don't say it like that.

20:54.542 --> 20:57.500
- Is it that different?
- Of course, it was a promotion.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.583
I must have drunk too much coffee.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.125
Where's the bathroom?

21:03.208 --> 21:04.958
Oh, I'll show you the way.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.542
"Artistic sense"? How ridiculous.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.583
She can't even tell apart
Gogh and Gauguin.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.387
I'll get you that piece
for 1.2 billion won.

21:12.583 --> 21:15.958
I just want that piece to find an owner
that deserves it.

21:16.042 --> 21:17.750
She just said 800 million.

21:17.833 --> 21:20.083
I can never get that for that price.

21:21.292 --> 21:22.375
One billion, then.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.917
I'm doing this because I don't want
that woman getting that piece.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.583
You're really good at this.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.667
But I want that Takashi piece
you have in exchange.

21:32.750 --> 21:33.917
How much can I get for it?

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
Four billion if it's auctioned,
and five if you give it to me.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.417
You really are something.

21:40.042 --> 21:41.875
When can I come get the Hopper piece?

21:42.208 --> 21:44.458
Just sign the certificate I send you,

21:44.542 --> 21:45.782
and we'll take good care of it.

21:45.833 --> 21:48.750
But isn't it funny to buy a piece
for a billion won

21:48.917 --> 21:50.625
and not even look at it?

21:51.125 --> 21:54.625
Ma'am, did you look around all the land
you bought in the suburbs?

21:54.708 --> 21:55.708
You have a point.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.167
How did it go, Tae-jun?

22:06.000 --> 22:07.125
See you later.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.333
Did something good happen?

22:20.958 --> 22:22.000
Yes.

22:22.250 --> 22:24.792
- What about those women?
- They left a moment ago.

22:26.042 --> 22:30.583
They're always going around in groups,
gossiping about useless stuff.

22:31.125 --> 22:32.417
They're so uncultured.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.525
Will she give us the Takashi piece?

22:34.958 --> 22:36.250
I think she might.

22:38.917 --> 22:40.208
I read the article.

22:40.750 --> 22:43.083
What would you gain
from going against me like that?

22:43.708 --> 22:45.625
I'll take responsibility
and take care of it.

22:47.125 --> 22:49.458
You'd better not mention
that rising artist exhibit again.

22:50.292 --> 22:52.750
If you don't find a decent artist
for the exhibit,

22:53.458 --> 22:55.667
this is going to be your last exhibit.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.375
So think carefully.

23:32.667 --> 23:34.458
<i>What? Really?</i>

23:35.042 --> 23:36.792
<i>Zio Shin said he'll work with you?</i>

23:37.125 --> 23:38.125
It's not confirmed yet.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.917
<i>You're unbelievable, how could you
come up with such an idea?</i>

23:42.125 --> 23:45.625
<i>Who would want to work
with the woman who dumped him?</i>

23:45.708 --> 23:48.188
Why mention something that happened
ten years ago? I better go.

24:33.417 --> 24:36.583
I thought interactive art
fell out of popularity.

24:36.792 --> 24:38.708
I guess the artist
is what's more important.

24:40.542 --> 24:41.792
What's your agency?

24:42.792 --> 24:44.042
I don't have one.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.625
You need one to exhibit your work
in places like Mirae Culture Center.

24:48.958 --> 24:50.750
I'm not interested in places like Mirae.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.250
The name sucks, too.

24:52.625 --> 24:56.167
In Korea, strange places with weird names
are the ones with authority.

25:10.125 --> 25:12.375
So you are not willing
to display your work in Korea?

25:12.458 --> 25:14.250
I heard you rejected a billion won offer.

25:14.458 --> 25:17.125
I don't like people who start talking
money right from the start.

25:17.208 --> 25:20.083
Right? That's a bit tacky.

25:23.292 --> 25:24.625
Let me be frank with you.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.833
I want you to be the main artist

25:27.250 --> 25:29.210
for our reopening exhibit
at Mirae Culture Center.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.083
Is that offer

25:33.750 --> 25:34.833
a personal one?

25:38.667 --> 25:40.208
I don't work like that.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.542
You don't want some?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.917
CIVIC BANK'S 1ST ACCOUNT

25:53.083 --> 25:55.667
Get closer to him and talk to him a bit.

25:57.208 --> 25:58.208
All right.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.875
Sir,

26:02.750 --> 26:04.083
how are you feeling?

26:06.375 --> 26:07.375
Pardon?

26:13.292 --> 26:16.292
It seemed like he told you something.
What did say?

26:18.250 --> 26:19.250
Well...

26:23.667 --> 26:24.708
He thanked me.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.458
He said that the civic bank

26:28.625 --> 26:30.667
must succeed.

26:31.833 --> 26:33.667
Thank you, we'll make sure it succeeds.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.300
- Can you get me some water?
- Professor Jang.

26:36.875 --> 26:38.833
- Yes.
- Let's take a photo together.

26:38.917 --> 26:42.125
- All right. Thank you.
- Smile.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.042
Okay.

26:44.750 --> 26:45.917
FOR THE PEOPLE

26:46.000 --> 26:47.958
Jang Tae-jun for the Gangnam District.

26:54.917 --> 26:58.542
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

27:06.667 --> 27:08.750
That doesn't suit him. How about this one?

27:10.208 --> 27:11.042
Okay.

27:11.125 --> 27:13.167
Make sure that's lined up straight.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.500
- Okay!
- Okay!

27:15.167 --> 27:17.125
Number two, Jang Tae-jun.

27:17.208 --> 27:18.458
- Go!
- Go!

27:19.542 --> 27:21.583
I'm Jang Tae-jun. Hello.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.417
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

27:23.500 --> 27:24.976
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Jang Tae-jun.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.542
Wow.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.792
Gosh, ma'am.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.042
- Gosh.
- Take a photo.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.458
I'll take that for you.

27:32.542 --> 27:33.833
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

27:48.292 --> 27:49.333
Mr. Jang.

27:49.583 --> 27:51.542
Mr. Ahn isn't here.

27:52.708 --> 27:54.875
You shouldn't just come in like this.

27:54.958 --> 27:57.500
I came to give him the list
of supporters for tomorrow.

27:57.583 --> 27:59.792
You could've called me,
why did you come here yourself?

27:59.875 --> 28:01.958
I'm not used to this kind of thing yet.

28:02.042 --> 28:04.833
You know we have a meeting, right?
Let's hurry before we hit traffic.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Okay.

28:07.833 --> 28:08.875
<i>I'm Baek Gwang-hyun.</i>

28:09.458 --> 28:11.333
<i>I entered law school in '99.</i>

28:11.417 --> 28:14.167
I met you once when you were
working on the school paper.

28:14.667 --> 28:17.500
- You can talk to me casually, sir.
- Oh, right. Nice to meet you.

28:17.583 --> 28:19.667
It's nice to meet you, sir.
Please have a seat.

28:19.750 --> 28:20.792
- All right.
- Here.

28:26.458 --> 28:28.000
I heard from Mr. Ahn

28:28.583 --> 28:31.500
that you're thinking
of around 3 billion to get started.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.708
Oh, it's 30 billion.

28:34.375 --> 28:35.417
What?

28:35.625 --> 28:38.708
The loans will be in small amounts,
with low interests,

28:39.208 --> 28:41.958
so I think we'd need that much
to able to earn a stable amount.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.042
Is that a bit overwhelming?

28:44.583 --> 28:47.042
No, it's fine. Mr. Jang,

28:47.708 --> 28:49.208
I'm not here to negotiate.

28:49.292 --> 28:52.208
Whatever you say, you'll get it.

28:52.292 --> 28:53.625
Is that so?

28:55.208 --> 28:59.250
"Daeil." The company was named
to mean, "against Japan."

28:59.958 --> 29:03.000
I named it to respect my grandfather's
part in the independence movement.

29:03.083 --> 29:05.542
Wow, he's very admirable.

29:06.042 --> 29:08.458
I'm putting my trust in you, then.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.583
Thank you for trusting me.

29:17.458 --> 29:21.083
- Mr. Oshima is here.
- I'll be there soon.

29:24.292 --> 29:26.458
I'm sorry, but give me a moment.
I'll be right back.

29:26.542 --> 29:27.542
All right.

29:30.708 --> 29:32.125
He seems pretty nice.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.417
He sponsors our Party often.

29:34.500 --> 29:37.625
I think he could be a politician too.
He's gentle and good with words.

29:38.583 --> 29:41.875
But I believe you'll be
a better politician,

29:41.958 --> 29:42.958
since you're brave.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.500
I was very touched that day

29:45.708 --> 29:47.458
when you ran over to the man on fire.

29:48.292 --> 29:51.750
No one knew what to do,
and you were the only one who rushed over.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.750
That was nothing, it was just instinct.

29:56.417 --> 29:58.042
Someone was dying, you know.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.958
They say that what you do
in such situations is who you truly are.

30:03.542 --> 30:05.208
You're different from other people.

30:06.792 --> 30:07.792
Oh, right.

30:14.667 --> 30:16.583
- What's this?
- It's a bribe.

30:18.958 --> 30:20.083
A bribe?

30:21.833 --> 30:23.583
That means you want something in return.

30:24.333 --> 30:26.417
Buy me a drink sometime.

30:32.583 --> 30:34.042
Do you have feelings for me?

30:49.083 --> 30:50.375
I haven't seen that before.

30:52.625 --> 30:54.542
It's a congratulatory gift from the Party.

30:58.167 --> 30:59.875
It looks a bit cheap, though.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.250
It does?

31:06.500 --> 31:09.917
But still, the Party gave it to you,
so you better wear it.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.667
Politics is about the cause, not fashion.

31:16.500 --> 31:20.208
You know, I think you might
do better than me at this.

31:20.667 --> 31:22.458
The road to the Blue House
is open, you know.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.583
Are you just going to stand there
and take photos?

31:24.750 --> 31:26.875
You're getting way ahead
of yourself again.

31:26.958 --> 31:28.417
Getting ahead is how you win.

31:29.625 --> 31:30.625
Let me see.

31:33.542 --> 31:36.167
I think we look pretty decent today.

31:39.708 --> 31:40.708
You're right.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.167
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:45.250 --> 31:46.875
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.542
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:50.833 --> 31:54.083
- Senator, thank you for coming.
- Hello, Mr. Jang.

31:54.167 --> 31:56.458
- Oh, hello.
- This is my wife.

31:56.583 --> 31:58.917
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello, Ms. Oh.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
- This is my husband.
- Hello.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.792
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

32:08.792 --> 32:12.083
There's one of the women
I talked to you about.

32:12.958 --> 32:16.208
Oh, the one who kept talking about Hopper?

32:17.375 --> 32:18.958
She's looking, just smile.

32:23.792 --> 32:25.583
Let's do it.

32:25.667 --> 32:26.708
Hello.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.333
I'm also a huge fan
of Edward Hopper's works.

32:31.375 --> 32:34.000
I heard a piece was hung
in President Obama's office.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.167
- You know Hopper?
- Of course.

32:36.250 --> 32:37.667
You have a great artistic sense.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.625
Hello, ma'am.

32:39.708 --> 32:41.542
Hello, Ms. Oh.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.208
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Sure.

32:44.292 --> 32:45.875
- I'll see you again soon.
- Yes.

32:50.167 --> 32:51.292
Hello.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.375
Who...

32:52.792 --> 32:55.583
I'm Mr. Jang's political aide,
Park Eun-ji.

33:00.792 --> 33:04.125
I heard you were his student.
You're quite a beauty.

33:21.083 --> 33:22.875
I'm Jang Tae-jun, her husband.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.375
I'm Zio Shin.

33:24.458 --> 33:27.500
Oh, this is the man
you wanted to do the exhibit with.

33:27.583 --> 33:28.917
It's nice to meet you.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.378
I heard she's making a lot of effort
to lure you.

33:32.375 --> 33:34.125
I see my efforts paid off,

33:34.208 --> 33:35.667
seeing how you've come here.

33:36.958 --> 33:37.958
I hope you work with her.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.917
She's putting everything
into that reopening exhibit.

33:43.167 --> 33:44.833
There are many people like her.

33:46.750 --> 33:50.458
But the wine is so expensive,
it's hard to pity them.

33:55.875 --> 33:57.042
Is that so?

33:57.875 --> 33:59.917
<i>I know landlords have divine authority
these days,</i>

34:00.000 --> 34:02.640
<i>but I can't afford to do business
while paying such expensive rent.</i>

34:02.708 --> 34:06.167
Since this is a sponsorship event,
many people ask me this.

34:06.750 --> 34:08.833
"Which account should I send my money to?"

34:09.417 --> 34:10.792
Don't donate your money.

34:12.000 --> 34:15.417
Invest it, since we'll make you a profit.

34:16.417 --> 34:18.708
I heard that this is very expensive wine.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.083
Think of this as our investment

34:22.167 --> 34:24.375
to gain many great investors.

34:24.458 --> 34:26.000
Let's have a toast for our cause!

34:26.375 --> 34:27.375
Cheers!

34:27.458 --> 34:29.625
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

34:29.708 --> 34:32.208
Mr. Jang, you're so good with words.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.583
You look like a politician now.

34:36.667 --> 34:38.375
All thanks to you, Su-yeon.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.833
Mr. Jang, our Party leader
is waiting for you upstairs.

34:48.917 --> 34:51.000
Really? Okay. I'll see you later.

34:57.625 --> 35:00.958
Eun-ji. Why don't we have a drink
together when this is over?

35:01.042 --> 35:02.667
Don't you see I'm working?

35:05.667 --> 35:06.750
You're here.

35:07.667 --> 35:08.875
Hello, sir.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.917
Let me introduce you.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.792
This is the new face of our Party,
Jang Tae-jun.

35:14.875 --> 35:16.125
And this is...

35:16.208 --> 35:18.792
This is Mr. Nam Kyu-sik,
the CEO of Angel Venture Investments.

35:18.875 --> 35:20.208
It's nice to meet you, sir.

35:22.042 --> 35:23.542
All right, sit down.

35:23.625 --> 35:24.750
Please have a seat.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.167
Sir, Mr. Nam here agrees with our cause,

35:30.292 --> 35:34.292
and he's decided to invest in it.
An amount of 10 billion won.

35:35.708 --> 35:38.583
We really needed someone
to step up first for our cause.

35:38.667 --> 35:41.250
Please, don't. Actually,

35:41.875 --> 35:43.292
I haven't decided for sure yet.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.333
We just can't do this openly yet,

35:46.958 --> 35:48.250
but let's do it properly.

35:49.083 --> 35:51.963
This is for a decent cause, so I'm sure
he'll think this over positively.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.333
All right.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.833
Let's all have a drink together.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.458
- Have a drink, sir.
- Cheers.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.333
Why did the free school meals policy work?

36:11.542 --> 36:12.583
It's simple.

36:13.333 --> 36:16.542
It's something that parents
who have packed lunches can relate to.

36:17.083 --> 36:20.000
"Why would you stop
such a decent thing, you jerks?"

36:20.667 --> 36:22.250
That's what people should say about it.

36:22.333 --> 36:25.250
We have to do this the simple way,
nothing complex.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.083
Why do politics

36:27.667 --> 36:29.583
the hard way?

36:32.708 --> 36:35.083
I thought he was a teaching dweeb,

36:35.458 --> 36:36.792
but he's a wolf.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.000
So,

36:40.958 --> 36:42.000
did you make up your mind?

36:42.625 --> 36:45.125
I'm not sure I can work with you.

36:45.708 --> 36:48.125
Don't be like that.
Just stop by the center sometime.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.125
How about next week?

36:50.500 --> 36:53.042
I'm going to Paris. I have an exhibit.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.333
Do you want to join me?

37:18.917 --> 37:20.375
This suits you well.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.125
Have you ever done it with a congressman?

39:03.333 --> 39:04.708
I'm doing it right now.

39:32.208 --> 39:33.917
Did you overdo yourself last night?

39:35.125 --> 39:37.167
How can you become a congressman
with that energy?

39:37.792 --> 39:40.083
They don't get elected
based on their physical stamina.

39:41.125 --> 39:44.292
What's going on, though?
You can hardly wake up in the morning.

39:45.250 --> 39:46.792
I thought I should work out a bit.

39:47.292 --> 39:49.917
And spend some time with you too.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.958
Did things go well last night?

39:53.500 --> 39:55.375
Nothing will get in my way.

39:56.167 --> 39:57.458
Aren't you being too cocky?

39:58.125 --> 40:00.000
Why? I thought you wanted
a successful husband.

40:00.083 --> 40:01.708
You reek of alcohol.

40:01.958 --> 40:03.292
Let's keep exercising.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.875
- Come on, let's exercise.
- How much did you drink?

40:07.125 --> 40:08.375
Wait for me.

40:09.958 --> 40:11.542
What about the parents?

40:12.208 --> 40:15.167
We scheduled campaigns
targeting women's clubs.

40:15.375 --> 40:19.583
Education is an important subject,
so I want to put a lot of focus on it.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.583
We already contacted reporters, and...

40:21.667 --> 40:25.333
So we're preparing live broadcasts
on Facebook and YouTube.

40:25.417 --> 40:28.458
Okay, then I'll do the speech
tomorrow morning.

40:28.542 --> 40:30.462
- Okay.
- If there's nothing else, I'll head off.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.860
You still have a lot of time
before your dinner appointment.

40:32.917 --> 40:35.708
I have somewhere I need to go first.
Would you join me, Eun-ji?

40:35.792 --> 40:36.792
Sure.

40:37.375 --> 40:39.333
I'll drive, sir.

40:39.542 --> 40:40.625
I'll drive myself.

40:43.750 --> 40:45.750
<i>One glass is 1,000 won?</i>

40:46.875 --> 40:49.083
He sold drinks by glasses,

40:49.667 --> 40:52.125
saying some people didn't have
the money to buy a bottle.

40:55.542 --> 40:57.000
I hope he gets better soon.

40:59.542 --> 41:02.125
You can become a congressman
and take care of him.

41:08.917 --> 41:12.000
So we're putting up a banner
with no names of any artists.

41:12.125 --> 41:14.542
People will think we're not announcing
any names on purpose.

41:15.208 --> 41:16.792
The auction will go smoothly, right?

41:17.500 --> 41:21.083
It's Ms. Min's first time doing this,
so make sure things go well.

41:22.833 --> 41:25.125
I'll go to Paris, Director.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.875
Ms. Min's family company branch in Paris

41:27.958 --> 41:29.583
promised to send people to help.

41:29.667 --> 41:33.042
Don't you think we should be careful
about conglomerates nowadays?

41:34.833 --> 41:37.625
It's a sensitive issue. I believe
a professional should handle this.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.667
Well, it's true you've never made
any mistakes.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.917
I think this area is okay,
so just organize this part.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Yes, ma'am.

41:54.042 --> 41:55.708
Let me talk to you for a minute.

41:57.042 --> 41:59.250
Does it have to be now? I'm busy.

41:59.333 --> 42:01.792
What happened with the Paris business?

42:04.250 --> 42:06.000
It's your first time, Ms. Min.

42:06.375 --> 42:08.167
Don't you think it's better
for me to do it?

42:08.250 --> 42:09.792
Why are you doing this?

42:10.667 --> 42:12.667
It's just money laundering!

42:14.042 --> 42:15.333
Yes, you're right.

42:17.750 --> 42:20.500
But you need a name value to do it right.

42:22.125 --> 42:23.167
I guess

42:24.125 --> 42:25.917
you have nothing to be afraid of.

42:27.625 --> 42:28.625
Why?

42:29.417 --> 42:31.708
You thought only plutocrats have no fear?

42:33.833 --> 42:36.250
You should think about other things too,

42:36.917 --> 42:39.083
not just about making
your breasts bigger all the time.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.125
{\an8}ZIO SHIN PHOTO EXHIBIT.

43:02.208 --> 43:05.167
- How do you do? Pleased to meet you.
- Thanks.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.083
How about you guys take a selfie together?

43:07.708 --> 43:08.708
One, two...

43:08.750 --> 43:10.125
- Is this good?
- Yes.

43:11.917 --> 43:13.125
Thank you. Bye.

43:18.292 --> 43:20.167
Take a photo with me, too.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
Why

44:09.833 --> 44:12.042
aren't you getting married anytime soon?

44:12.958 --> 44:15.625
I should at least stay single
to meet you like this.

44:31.542 --> 44:32.542
Here you go.

45:14.833 --> 45:16.667
Don't film me.

45:18.292 --> 45:19.542
Stop that!

45:20.167 --> 45:21.375
- Stop it.
- Why?

45:21.458 --> 45:22.958
Come on, stop it.

45:23.042 --> 45:24.208
Come on.

45:24.292 --> 45:25.708
- Don't do that.
- Stop it.

45:25.792 --> 45:26.792
Stop.

45:27.542 --> 45:28.750
Stop it.

47:07.375 --> 47:09.917
The main piece for today's auction

47:10.500 --> 47:12.917
is Zhou Zhang's <i>Tears Of a Dragon.</i>

47:13.000 --> 47:17.458
Bidding will start with 1.7 million euros.

47:19.375 --> 47:20.792
Three million.

47:20.875 --> 47:21.875
Four million?

47:22.458 --> 47:24.333
And 4.5 million.

47:24.417 --> 47:25.667
Five million?

47:26.542 --> 47:27.917
Six million?

47:29.417 --> 47:31.583
Six million. Going once...

47:33.083 --> 47:34.750
Seven million for the gentleman.

47:34.833 --> 47:36.458
Eight million for the lady.

47:38.375 --> 47:39.375
Nine million.

47:40.042 --> 47:41.042
Ten million.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.000
Ten million, going once.

47:44.208 --> 47:46.292
Ten million, going twice.

47:47.208 --> 47:48.458
Ten million, going three times.

47:49.083 --> 47:51.833
Sold for ten million euros.
Congratulations, ma'am.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.125
We will proceed to the next piece.

47:56.667 --> 48:02.000
Next is a painting by Michael Coren.
We'll start with 950,000 euros.

48:17.250 --> 48:19.208
Hey, what's going on?

48:19.292 --> 48:20.208
You must be Zio.

48:20.292 --> 48:21.292
I am.

48:27.375 --> 48:28.750
Thank you.

48:32.500 --> 48:33.500
All right.

48:34.458 --> 48:35.458
Su-yeon,

48:36.500 --> 48:37.875
please contact me again next time.

48:37.958 --> 48:41.167
So you two made a 100-million-won painting
get sold for 10 billion?

48:41.917 --> 48:44.167
The one who sold the painting
was in on it, too.

48:44.583 --> 48:47.250
So that deal left us with 10 billion won.

48:47.333 --> 48:50.792
That means you're embezzling
that much money from the company.

48:51.125 --> 48:52.285
Can the company run properly?

48:52.333 --> 48:54.250
The company has the picture.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.458
The Zhou Zhang we bought for 10 billion.

48:56.958 --> 48:59.708
We'll display that at the center
a few times,

48:59.792 --> 49:02.625
and then get a loan of 10 billion
with it as mortgage,

49:02.708 --> 49:04.188
since it's a 10-billion-won painting.

49:08.625 --> 49:11.125
I just did a huge deal,
so I'll treat you today.

49:33.875 --> 49:35.375
How were things recently?

49:36.167 --> 49:37.250
Oh, yes.

49:37.542 --> 49:38.625
Good news...

49:38.708 --> 49:41.542
Mr. Jang, what are you doing?
Come on, join us.

49:41.625 --> 49:43.500
Come over here!

49:43.583 --> 49:46.333
I was preoccupied for a minute.

49:46.667 --> 49:49.875
Let's drink to Mr. Jang's election!

49:50.125 --> 49:51.375
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

49:57.833 --> 50:01.625
HEY, EUN-JI. GOOD MORNING.
I'M WAITING OUTSIDE TO GIVE YOU A RIDE.

50:15.417 --> 50:17.667
- Let's hurry.
- All right.

50:20.833 --> 50:22.875
We should have breakfast before we go.

50:39.417 --> 50:41.083
Excuse me. Ms. Oh Su-yeon?

50:41.792 --> 50:44.667
You're under arrest for violating
laws regarding foreign exchange

50:44.750 --> 50:46.250
and specific economic crimes.

50:47.500 --> 50:49.083
- Wait a minute.
- Zio.

50:49.917 --> 50:50.958
I'll handle this.

51:09.417 --> 51:11.292
She's very pretty.

51:15.625 --> 51:18.792
And you are beautiful.

51:20.042 --> 51:21.917
And you have a great personality.

51:37.375 --> 51:38.833
Did you have dinner?

51:40.333 --> 51:41.708
I'll eat when I get home.

51:42.792 --> 51:44.042
How was Paris?

51:45.208 --> 51:48.000
Is there a problem with the picture
I bought at the auction?

51:48.375 --> 51:50.208
That's for a slush fund, isn't it?

51:50.625 --> 51:54.208
Raising the price that much
would leave at least eight billion won.

51:54.750 --> 51:56.292
A picture's value increasing means

51:56.542 --> 51:58.875
that the curator
has a great artistic sense.

51:59.167 --> 52:01.375
- You keep records, right?
- Of course.

52:01.625 --> 52:03.958
Records of our members, the transactions,

52:04.042 --> 52:07.083
and the art pieces we have.
Our center is very meticulous.

52:07.167 --> 52:09.875
Not things like that. Secretive records.

52:15.042 --> 52:19.292
Ms. Lee of Daewon Group bought a Takashi
on her wedding anniversary.

52:19.875 --> 52:22.500
A daughter-in-law of Sangjin's chairman
wanted a trade.

52:22.750 --> 52:25.083
Ms. Yang wanted a nude painting.

52:25.292 --> 52:27.750
And Ms. Lee Dong-jin wants
a painting to hang in the bedroom.

52:27.833 --> 52:29.625
Anything by Peter Doig.

52:30.208 --> 52:32.583
The Prosecutor General
only wants one of his.

52:34.167 --> 52:36.042
That's all I know.

52:37.625 --> 52:39.750
And you were doing business with Zio Shin?

52:44.542 --> 52:46.125
I'm preparing an exhibit

52:47.625 --> 52:49.042
with Zio Shin.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.500
Ma'am, one minute, please.

52:55.167 --> 52:57.708
A JUST PROSECUTION FOR CITIZENS

53:05.792 --> 53:07.083
<i>You can't do this.</i>

53:07.167 --> 53:09.500
He's her husband,
which means he's involved.

53:09.583 --> 53:10.750
Besides, he's a politician.

53:10.958 --> 53:13.208
This could lead to a huge scandal.

53:14.500 --> 53:16.875
It's Jang Tae-jun who's come to me.

53:17.375 --> 53:21.667
Don't worry, and get that pretty
Ms. Oh some dinner.

53:25.750 --> 53:27.458
Oh, gosh.

53:39.625 --> 53:43.042
I was excited to hear
that a rising politician was here.

53:43.542 --> 53:45.742
Prosecutor Cho Yeong-seon
of the Seoul Central District.

53:45.792 --> 53:48.750
Oh, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Jang Tae-jun.

53:48.833 --> 53:51.167
What did my wife do wrong?

53:51.250 --> 53:52.625
You didn't know?

53:53.167 --> 53:55.958
Ms. Oh is a professional
at making slush funds for the wealthy.

53:56.042 --> 53:58.000
And at amounts up to several billion.

53:58.083 --> 54:01.917
How could a culture center curator
make money like that?

54:02.000 --> 54:04.208
But you made several billion, too.

54:04.458 --> 54:06.292
The fund for that civic bank
you're preparing,

54:06.375 --> 54:08.333
I know it's a lot of money.

54:08.708 --> 54:10.458
You're starting with 30 billion won?

54:11.333 --> 54:14.208
This is how I think. I guess this is
why people call me a nut case.

54:16.000 --> 54:19.542
I'm actually more interested in you
than your wife.

54:20.042 --> 54:24.208
The suspicious connection between
Mirae Group and the Republican Party.

54:24.292 --> 54:27.583
The connection between Mirae Group
and the Republican Party?

54:27.667 --> 54:30.667
When Ms. Oh launders black money
and makes it clean,

54:30.750 --> 54:33.708
you make the civic bank with it.
Isn't that how it goes?

54:33.958 --> 54:35.708
That's what usually happens in movies.

54:36.375 --> 54:40.083
I don't think that kind of imagination
is a skill you need.

54:40.167 --> 54:41.958
It's a reasonable suspicion.

54:42.042 --> 54:44.375
You can't detain someone
based on suspicion.

54:44.458 --> 54:48.250
The Korean law lets us detain people
for 48 hours based on suspicion.

54:49.875 --> 54:52.583
I thought you'd know everything
since you're a professor,

54:52.958 --> 54:54.958
but I guess you don't.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.500
Did you actually think that you became
a candidate all on your own?

55:10.708 --> 55:12.667
You really are a nut case.

55:20.000 --> 55:21.125
<i>Did you get a warrant?</i>

55:21.208 --> 55:22.958
I think I need to look into this.

55:23.042 --> 55:24.958
I told you not to get ahead of yourself.

55:25.042 --> 55:26.958
Let her go right now.

55:47.208 --> 55:50.583
Your husband already has
as many connections as top politicians.

55:52.708 --> 55:53.708
Excuse me.

55:57.083 --> 55:58.583
Could you get me some water?

56:24.500 --> 56:26.140
<i>The Party is pretty sensitive about this.</i>

56:26.208 --> 56:28.667
Any scandals before the election
could cause trouble.

56:29.875 --> 56:32.375
We just met, and that's what you say?

56:32.500 --> 56:34.000
I'm just saying, be careful.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.208
Tae-jun.

56:36.958 --> 56:38.208
You've changed.

56:38.292 --> 56:40.667
No, I haven't. I'm just making an effort.

56:40.750 --> 56:44.083
Do we really have to hear things
like slush funds and money laundering?

56:44.208 --> 56:46.042
You could just quit
working for that center.

56:46.625 --> 56:48.465
I can earn enough
without you doing dirty work.

56:48.542 --> 56:50.750
- "Dirty work"?
- If I knew what you were doing,

56:50.833 --> 56:52.625
- I wouldn't have let you.
- You didn't know?

56:52.708 --> 56:54.958
Are you stupid? This is ridiculous.

56:55.958 --> 56:56.792
Don't cross the line.

56:56.875 --> 56:59.667
You're mistaken about something.
I decide what to do with my life.

56:59.750 --> 57:02.708
You think your ambition is some great
dream, but mine is nothing?

57:45.917 --> 57:49.250
You're a wannabe congressman,
but you have no respect for the law.

57:49.417 --> 57:50.833
Stop picking a fight.

57:58.917 --> 58:00.750
I don't think
it's just because of the center.

58:01.500 --> 58:02.958
But I don't know what they're after.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.917
She talked about the Republican Party,
then Mirae Group.

58:06.000 --> 58:07.167
Anyway,

58:07.958 --> 58:09.458
I've been to the Prosecutor's Office,

58:09.542 --> 58:12.375
so I'm qualified for a wife
of a congressman now.

58:17.333 --> 58:18.667
Let's raise it.

58:24.583 --> 58:27.083
I can see it has every element
of a hot art piece.

58:27.667 --> 58:30.333
First, the piece has to
be large and expensive.

58:30.417 --> 58:33.292
- And it...
- It has to be hard to understand.

58:33.792 --> 58:35.917
I guess you know
since you're an international artist.

58:38.917 --> 58:39.917
Is everything okay?

58:40.625 --> 58:43.625
I learned all this in school,
but I can't remember anything.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.833
That's what you filmed in Paris.

59:18.625 --> 59:20.958
<i>Why would you suddenly
withdraw your investment?</i>

59:21.458 --> 59:23.875
I'm just a powerless businessman,

59:24.750 --> 59:26.625
but I can't waste
my company's money anymore.

59:26.708 --> 59:29.208
Don't say it like that, sir.

59:29.667 --> 59:32.375
Investments from businessmen like you
are necessary

59:32.500 --> 59:34.417
for the civic bank to have a good start.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.333
- Investments?
- Yes.

59:35.417 --> 59:37.750
I've already given enough
for the slush funds.

59:38.667 --> 59:41.333
We're not a conglomerate,
I can't just give 10 billion won.

59:41.417 --> 59:44.083
Chairman Han can get that money easily.

59:44.167 --> 59:46.708
Why make smaller companies
suffer like this?

59:47.375 --> 59:51.667
You just want us to be the scapegoat
if something goes wrong, right?

59:53.333 --> 59:55.583
I guess it was a mistake coming here.

59:56.167 --> 59:58.583
But you tell Mr. Ahn this.

59:59.292 --> 01:00:02.708
I won't just stand by
if he sends people to scare me again.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:05.833
Wait...

01:00:27.792 --> 01:00:29.708
<i>Don't film me.</i>

01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:32.667
<i>Stop that!</i>

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:33.750
<i>Stop it.</i>

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:36.625
{\an8}Yes, I took some medicine.

01:00:38.208 --> 01:00:41.750
No, it's not that. I know the date.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.458
Okay, I will.

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.458
I'll stop by after work. All right.

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:58.292
There's a guest here to see you.

01:00:58.375 --> 01:01:00.708
Tae-jun cheated on me?

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:04.083
Do you have evidence?

01:01:04.167 --> 01:01:05.167
Pardon?

01:01:05.833 --> 01:01:08.750
Photos, voice recordings, videos.
Anything like that.

01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:13.125
No, I don't have anything like that.
I was just worried

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:14.958
about Eun-ji and Mr. Jang.

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:17.583
Really?

01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:20.333
So,

01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:23.000
what did you actually come here to say?

01:01:24.292 --> 01:01:26.375
Are you telling me

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:28.625
to keep my husband in line?

01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.042
Why don't you leave now?

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:37.917
Mr. Jang.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:40.138
About that thing
you asked me to look into.

01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:43.125
- I looked through the list of graduates.
- Yes?

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.292
But there was no Baek Gwang-hyun.

01:01:46.375 --> 01:01:49.625
There were some with the same name
among other years,

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:52.292
but none of them were in law school.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.333
Daeil is registered as a loan company,

01:01:55.417 --> 01:01:57.667
and it's connected
to gambling and prostitution.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.083
I'm sure it's not just a normal company.

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:04.000
<i>Mr. Nam said he'll withdraw
his investment.</i>

01:02:04.083 --> 01:02:08.500
What did he mean when he said
you sent people to bully him?

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.667
What are you talking about?

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:13.958
Hey, do you even know
what you're implying right now?

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:16.333
And there are many suspicious things
about Mr. Baek.

01:02:16.417 --> 01:02:17.792
Hey, Mr. Jang!

01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:20.333
We have enemies everywhere. You know that?

01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:23.458
Don't get swayed by nonsense,
and make sure you know your side.

01:02:23.542 --> 01:02:27.250
You have responsibilities.
You have to keep your focus.

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:28.917
I'm going to check if there isn't

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.542
anything fishy
about the companies that are investing.

01:02:31.625 --> 01:02:32.750
That's my responsibility.

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.500
He's really going to cause trouble.

01:02:35.667 --> 01:02:38.875
Hey! Stop bringing those inside.
I'm already annoyed as it is.

01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.583
Do you think this is a botanical garden?

01:02:40.667 --> 01:02:43.267
I gave them the hospital address,
but they keep sending them here,

01:02:43.333 --> 01:02:44.833
saying they hope he recovers soon.

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:49.625
Nonsense. That man who put himself
on fire is irrelevant.

01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:51.792
We need something fresh!

01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:09.250
Do you like Tae-jun?

01:03:09.833 --> 01:03:10.833
Excuse me?

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.042
He's a pretty decent man.

01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:18.167
But

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:22.083
you almost ruined that decent man's life.

01:03:26.917 --> 01:03:30.250
Let me give you some useful advice.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.833
When there are still some guys
who want to sleep with you,

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:37.458
find a nice guy and hold on to him.

01:03:40.208 --> 01:03:43.542
Or else girls with mediocre skills
like you will live a difficult life.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.250
What brings you here?

01:04:08.542 --> 01:04:11.667
I don't know where you heard
some nonsense to end up here,

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.958
- but you're mistaken.
- Mistaken?

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:21.000
Have I ever made you upset
about something like this?

01:04:21.167 --> 01:04:24.167
Did I ever say anything to you
about something like this?

01:04:32.208 --> 01:04:33.667
- I'm sorry.
- About what?

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.708
Are you sorry about cheating on me?

01:04:35.958 --> 01:04:38.208
Don't fool yourself.
I don't care about that.

01:04:38.292 --> 01:04:40.042
- Hey...
- But

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:42.917
don't get caught by anyone else.

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:45.917
If you ruin your life,
it's going to affect mine, too.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.333
You sound

01:04:51.292 --> 01:04:52.500
just like Hillary.

01:04:54.167 --> 01:04:55.292
Exactly.

01:04:56.250 --> 01:04:58.750
So, have an affair
when you become like Clinton, not now.

01:05:11.083 --> 01:05:14.583
They launder money through the center
and blackmail companies for money.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:17.750
And they empty citizen's pockets
by offering high-interest savings.

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:20.375
Some of that is given
to politicians as hush money,

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:23.667
and the rest is invested
in paper companies made beforehand.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.875
Then it goes bankrupt,
and everyone loses their deposits.

01:05:26.958 --> 01:05:29.768
The government must then give
50 million to each person as compensation.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:32.792
As civil servants, we can't sit and watch
while the government loses money.

01:05:32.875 --> 01:05:35.792
That seems exactly the same
as the Busan Savings Bank case.

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:37.333
They've just changed the name.

01:05:37.417 --> 01:05:40.917
And plus, they're emphasizing their
noble cause, talking about gentrification,

01:05:41.042 --> 01:05:42.442
so there's no one criticizing them.

01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.333
That Jang Tae-jun, though.

01:05:44.417 --> 01:05:46.417
His profile doesn't really suit
this kind of thing.

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:49.000
Whether he started knowing
about this or not,

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:51.417
he'll become a congressman
thanks to that civic bank.

01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:54.067
- He won't be able to play innocent later.
- Never mind that.

01:05:54.917 --> 01:05:56.750
Aside from Mr. Jang,

01:05:57.333 --> 01:05:59.667
you know who's behind all this, right?

01:05:59.750 --> 01:06:02.458
CIVIC BANK
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, MIRAE CULTURE CENTER

01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:06.625
Han Yong-seok is a conceptual artist

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.640
who makes intangible things into objects.

01:06:10.292 --> 01:06:14.375
His works of art are radical.

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:19.667
The inspiration he gets as an artist...

01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:24.208
Add "infinite" before "inspiration."

01:06:28.333 --> 01:06:33.250
The infinite inspiration he gets
as an artist comes from...

01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:36.792
Comes from...

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:56.083
She says, "It's nice to meet you.
I'm Minami."

01:06:56.167 --> 01:06:57.917
I can understand that much.

01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:02.583
What do you think is art, Minami?

01:07:04.542 --> 01:07:06.250
Come on, interpret that.

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:19.708
"Something beautiful."

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.125
Art is

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:24.708
shit.

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:32.542
Is that funny?

01:07:35.792 --> 01:07:37.042
Yes.

01:07:37.125 --> 01:07:40.417
Oh, what is it, Mr. Ahn?

01:07:42.333 --> 01:07:43.875
What are you doing? Hold him.

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.375
- Is that enough?
- Bring him here.

01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:56.375
You were happy to invest that money.

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:58.000
Do you think you can just say

01:07:58.083 --> 01:08:00.708
you've done enough and back out?

01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.750
I wasn't ready yet...

01:08:04.667 --> 01:08:06.750
That's your problem, you shit.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:09.167
Why did you agree
when you weren't even ready?

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:20.042
Gosh, that hurt.

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:30.792
I'm taking one, and two. They're all mine.

01:09:37.457 --> 01:09:39.500
How was it, sir?

01:09:40.417 --> 01:09:42.542
I accidentally hurt my hand, damn it.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.542
You really have a strange hobby, sir.

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:48.250
What about Jang Tae-jun?

01:09:49.625 --> 01:09:53.332
Don't worry, we're meeting together
with Mr. Ahn tomorrow.

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:01.458
<i>Tell Mr. Ahn that
Mr. Nam is taken care of.</i>

01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:12.042
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:35.750
The Republican Party...

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.083
Sir.

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:40.167
Were you awake?

01:10:41.875 --> 01:10:43.458
It's you, Professor Jang.

01:10:44.042 --> 01:10:46.875
Yes, it's me.
Candidate number two, Jang Tae-jun.

01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:51.167
Is my pub

01:10:51.917 --> 01:10:54.500
taken care of now?

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:56.917
Your pub?

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.333
What do you mean?

01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:02.958
They said they would

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.458
take care of the rent

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:09.042
and everything if I set myself on fire.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:13.042
I did everything they told me to,

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:17.958
so tell them to keep their promise.

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.292
You said it's a cultural foundation.

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.333
It seems like a charity foundation to me.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.083
Do you even know what art is?

01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:53.958
I see art on Instagram.

01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:57.583
What cheerful bullshit.

01:11:58.583 --> 01:11:59.667
I mean it.

01:11:59.875 --> 01:12:01.750
I have hundreds of artist friends.

01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:05.292
Then why are you here instead of living
in the States with those friends?

01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:16.083
Move.

01:12:22.917 --> 01:12:26.125
I need to think some more
about being the director.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.708
That son of a bitch.

01:12:35.625 --> 01:12:36.708
The director?

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:39.333
The board will decide soon.

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:42.750
It's out of my hands.

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:49.917
Does the chairman know about this?

01:12:51.042 --> 01:12:53.375
Is there something you discussed with him?

01:12:56.625 --> 01:13:00.167
He called Jason here himself.

01:13:01.792 --> 01:13:03.833
You should've known whom to suck up to.

01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:09.083
God, this is suffocating me.

01:13:11.458 --> 01:13:12.875
This goddamn thing.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.292
Mr. Park,

01:13:17.583 --> 01:13:18.917
come massage my feet.

01:13:19.083 --> 01:13:20.208
Yes, ma'am.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.792
I'll do a three-level massage.

01:13:31.042 --> 01:13:33.125
I'll begin with your metatarsal bones.

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:38.417
What are you doing?
Aren't you going to leave?

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:54.708
E-MAIL FROM MIN HYUN-AH

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:15.583
Ms. Oh, this...

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.542
The woman is so annoying.

01:15:39.625 --> 01:15:41.542
She's fussing
over this fucking lousy center.

01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:44.083
Hold that fucking lousy center

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:47.958
and shake it up.

01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:50.792
I thought you'd get me something nice.

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:52.583
<i>When you're ready,</i>

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:55.667
I'll get you something bigger.

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:01.167
Turn around.

01:16:09.417 --> 01:16:11.042
It's better to get a used one

01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:13.250
for your first car,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000
since you'd scrape it and crash it.

01:16:18.375 --> 01:16:19.917
<i>So you're saying running the center</i>

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:21.750
is just for practice?

01:16:23.333 --> 01:16:24.458
<i>Lie down.</i>

01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:30.917
Yes.

01:16:43.625 --> 01:16:44.625
Dad,

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.292
are you exercising?

01:16:51.792 --> 01:16:52.917
Get out.

01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:00.417
I meant you. Get out.

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:13.833
All right, let's turn over a new leaf
and focus

01:18:13.917 --> 01:18:14.917
on the civic bank.

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:17.792
That's why I invited you here.

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:22.167
Sir, you heard something strange
from Mr. Nam?

01:18:22.958 --> 01:18:24.917
There were several strange things.

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:27.708
Did you pay the man

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.250
who set himself on fire?

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:46.667
My company, Daeil. It means "Great Japan."

01:18:48.375 --> 01:18:52.750
I named it like that
after my grandfather said

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:55.167
useless hate toward Japan

01:18:55.875 --> 01:18:57.292
will only ruin Korea.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.833
Why don't you try this?

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:23.625
It's nice.

01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:28.500
That old man was always sitting
in the front of the rally.

01:19:28.583 --> 01:19:30.917
He got the money to pay his rent,

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.750
so it turned out well for him.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.417
We take care of things neatly
without any legal problems.

01:19:36.667 --> 01:19:37.500
What?

01:19:37.583 --> 01:19:38.903
Are you familiar with knife laws?

01:19:39.625 --> 01:19:42.542
It's very difficult to get permission
to own katanas,

01:19:42.625 --> 01:19:44.708
but this doesn't apply to that law

01:19:44.792 --> 01:19:48.875
because it's just a kitchen knife
for cutting sashimi.

01:19:51.875 --> 01:19:53.875
By the way, Mr. Jang.

01:19:55.042 --> 01:19:57.208
Which parts do you like?

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.167
I like

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:02.083
the Achilles heel.

01:20:02.917 --> 01:20:05.500
If you stab the stomach or the chest,
you could serve 20 years.

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:07.250
But...

01:20:08.542 --> 01:20:10.833
stabbing the Achilles heel
isn't that serious,

01:20:14.833 --> 01:20:16.333
since people don't die

01:20:17.042 --> 01:20:19.000
by getting stabbed there.

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:26.792
It might be hard to go jogging, though.

01:20:27.417 --> 01:20:29.792
Do you still go jogging every morning?

01:20:30.375 --> 01:20:32.708
With your sexy wife, Su-yeon?

01:20:34.167 --> 01:20:35.792
Are you threatening me?

01:20:35.875 --> 01:20:40.208
Come on, don't be like this
when we're here for a good cause.

01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:43.208
"Threatening"? You're so clueless.

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:45.625
Coming out.

01:20:46.667 --> 01:20:49.208
I'm revealing my true self.

01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:53.417
We're close friends now, aren't we?

01:20:54.708 --> 01:20:57.750
I should support you properly,

01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.583
like family.

01:21:01.667 --> 01:21:04.250
Come on, look.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Look at that.

01:21:06.042 --> 01:21:08.500
Don't you feel like it's waiting for you?

01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:11.417
You should get in there, don't you think?

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:14.375
Congressman Jang Tae-jun!

01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:16.958
That sounds great.
Now, let's drink together.

01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:19.750
Come on, drink with me.

01:21:20.583 --> 01:21:21.792
Here...

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:56.083
You think using money is bad,
but selling your body is okay?

01:21:59.125 --> 01:22:02.125
This USB can hold up to 30,000 books.

01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:04.000
And about 2,000 photos.

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:08.417
I wonder how much video
it can hold. It was pretty long.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:12.792
So what are you going to do with it?

01:22:16.542 --> 01:22:18.250
You're still a snob, Su-yeon.

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:27.083
What would happen if this gets out?

01:22:27.792 --> 01:22:31.375
Your husband would go back
to being a professor.

01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:34.542
You might not get divorced,

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:38.250
but I guess you might get
into a huge fight.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.292
It's so strange.

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:11.500
Why are you always rallying
against conglomerates?

01:23:12.667 --> 01:23:14.333
I know you envy the wealthy.

01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:23.000
Listen, Su-yeon.

01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:26.333
Only the wealthy live without fear.

01:23:27.167 --> 01:23:29.458
You shouldn't be the same,
you should have fear.

01:23:31.333 --> 01:23:34.958
You should be afraid of me,
and Hwa-lan as well.

01:24:01.958 --> 01:24:04.917
Okay, I'm going.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:07.708
I said I'm going! Fuck!

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:19.958
Shit, that's disgusting.

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:22.625
Hey, are you okay?

01:24:25.042 --> 01:24:26.917
Stand up straight.

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.083
Come on, don't fall down.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:31.875
Look at this.

01:24:31.958 --> 01:24:33.000
What's this?

01:24:35.458 --> 01:24:36.625
Take-out?

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.375
All right, let's go.

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:43.667
Come on.

01:24:47.083 --> 01:24:51.000
Hey, don't stare at me like that.

01:24:51.542 --> 01:24:53.458
I like you.

01:24:54.375 --> 01:24:56.667
You said you wanted a civic bank.

01:24:56.917 --> 01:24:59.792
Things will be so easy
when you become a congressman.

01:24:59.875 --> 01:25:01.250
Don't you think so?

01:25:01.667 --> 01:25:03.917
Stop touching my nose!

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.333
What do you think you're doing?

01:25:06.417 --> 01:25:08.042
Let me go!

01:25:08.583 --> 01:25:11.750
You're a bunch of sick thugs!

01:25:12.458 --> 01:25:14.167
That bullshit about being my junior...

01:25:14.333 --> 01:25:18.292
All you know is how to use sashimi knives.

01:25:18.667 --> 01:25:22.708
You just got knocked down
by a kick in the knee, you losers.

01:25:23.542 --> 01:25:26.583
What? You take care of things
neatly with no legal problems?

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:29.708
Everything you do is so sloppy!

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.500
If you take care of things so neatly,
how would I know this?

01:25:34.167 --> 01:25:36.333
I know you made that man
set himself on fire.

01:25:36.958 --> 01:25:39.917
You're all dead
if any reporter gets this information.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.500
- Get that?
- I told you that's never going to happen!

01:25:42.583 --> 01:25:43.833
Hey, you.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.250
Fuck you, asshole.

01:25:48.333 --> 01:25:50.542
Why are you swearing like this?

01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:54.875
You son of a bitch.
Go to hell, you fucker.

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:57.667
I'm really good at swearing, you know.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.917
That Congress badge isn't even real gold.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.833
It's silver, and it only costs 35,000 won.

01:26:05.375 --> 01:26:08.833
- What the...
- I know that, you little shit.

01:26:09.417 --> 01:26:10.583
Damn it.

01:26:14.083 --> 01:26:15.500
The Republican Party...

01:26:18.458 --> 01:26:21.042
is fucking damned now, you suckers!

01:26:23.125 --> 01:26:25.375
God... That crazy idiot.

01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:40.833
It's cold, let's talk inside.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.500
I just met Ms. Min.

01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:46.750
What did she want?

01:26:50.833 --> 01:26:52.125
She wants me ruined.

01:26:55.208 --> 01:26:56.208
I'm sorry.

01:26:56.875 --> 01:26:58.083
"Sorry"?

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.042
That's a useless word.

01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:06.417
If the video gets out,
I lose my family and my work.

01:27:06.792 --> 01:27:09.542
You could just run away to Paris,
but not me.

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:11.458
Let's leave together.

01:27:11.542 --> 01:27:13.250
To where? Paris?

01:27:14.292 --> 01:27:16.583
I'm not leaving.
I have no intention of running away.

01:27:16.667 --> 01:27:18.250
You said you weren't happy here.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.792
You can't even love someone freely.

01:27:22.375 --> 01:27:24.208
Go look at the video.

01:27:25.333 --> 01:27:27.917
Go see how dirty that love seems.

01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:45.792
Goodness.

01:27:48.458 --> 01:27:50.500
INCOMING CALL JANG TAE-JUN

01:27:52.458 --> 01:27:56.125
<i>Su-yeon! My amazing Su-yeon.</i>

01:27:58.125 --> 01:28:00.542
<i>I told you I'd make you happy, right?</i>

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:04.167
<i>I have tuna sashimi.</i>

01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:06.958
I have the best parts.

01:28:08.167 --> 01:28:09.458
<i>You love this,</i>

01:28:10.167 --> 01:28:11.167
<i>right?</i>

01:28:12.792 --> 01:28:15.917
I'll hurry home with this.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.500
<i>Okay?</i>

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:24.083
But where am I?

01:28:25.125 --> 01:28:26.708
Where is this place?

01:28:40.333 --> 01:28:42.125
I'm sorry to call you at this hour.

01:29:03.958 --> 01:29:06.000
WE SUPPORT THE CIVIC BANK

01:30:08.042 --> 01:30:10.083
What are you looking at so intently?

01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:12.292
It's nothing, sir.

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:18.125
I heard

01:30:19.083 --> 01:30:20.875
you're the one who called Jason.

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:26.083
You said I'd be the next director.

01:30:28.125 --> 01:30:30.667
Of course, it's your turn.

01:30:32.083 --> 01:30:34.750
You've done so much until now, right?

01:30:35.667 --> 01:30:37.083
And we're partners.

01:30:43.208 --> 01:30:44.333
I like things...

01:30:47.292 --> 01:30:48.750
that are certain.

01:30:52.167 --> 01:30:53.375
Certain?

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:58.167
Yes, I like that, too.

01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:02.250
Ms. Kim!

01:32:32.208 --> 01:32:34.958
Mr. Han, let's talk for a minute.

01:32:35.042 --> 01:32:36.125
Be quiet.

01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:38.542
Art is not made with words.

01:32:43.583 --> 01:32:45.208
Wait. Please.

01:33:00.917 --> 01:33:02.167
Make sure you get good shots.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:04.958
I've caught you at the scene.

01:33:05.042 --> 01:33:07.458
They say there's no law
against adultery anymore,

01:33:07.542 --> 01:33:09.083
but that's criminal law.

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:13.833
Why don't we figure out how much
compensation you'll pay in a civil suit.

01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:16.750
You bitch.

01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:18.958
I guess you succeeded today.

01:33:28.542 --> 01:33:30.125
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:33:30.792 --> 01:33:32.667
You can't even get it up.

01:33:35.333 --> 01:33:36.458
Just not with you.

01:33:36.542 --> 01:33:38.500
I'm doing well
with other women, you bitch.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:53.667
<i>Mr. Jeong Shin-woo,
who set himself on fire</i>

01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:56.833
<i>in front of the National Assembly Building
died around 5 a.m. today.</i>

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.458
The cause of death is assumed to be

01:33:58.542 --> 01:34:01.375
the incident's aftereffects affecting
his heart disease. Mr. Jeong's...

01:34:01.958 --> 01:34:03.833
There's a press briefing in 30 minutes.

01:34:04.375 --> 01:34:06.042
What briefing?

01:34:06.125 --> 01:34:07.917
Mr. Jang, how do you feel right now?

01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:09.333
This way, sir.

01:34:09.417 --> 01:34:11.268
- Mr. Jang, please give us a comment.
- Mr. Jang.

01:34:11.292 --> 01:34:13.012
The press briefing will begin
in 30 minutes.

01:34:13.042 --> 01:34:15.333
- Mr. Jang!
- Please give us a comment.

01:34:15.417 --> 01:34:16.583
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:20.792
HEAD OF PARTY'S OFFICE

01:34:23.250 --> 01:34:24.625
You surprised me.

01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:27.708
Your timing is perfect.

01:34:28.292 --> 01:34:30.212
I was just about to find you
to get complimented.

01:34:30.417 --> 01:34:32.125
- What?
- I took care of things

01:34:32.208 --> 01:34:33.958
really neatly, just like you said.

01:34:36.917 --> 01:34:38.167
You bastard!

01:34:39.875 --> 01:34:41.625
Unbelievable.

01:34:43.042 --> 01:34:45.083
You idiot.

01:34:45.167 --> 01:34:47.583
- It hurts.
- I'm supposed to be a thug,

01:34:47.667 --> 01:34:49.750
it'll be embarrassing to get beaten twice.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:51.792
Don't you think so?

01:34:55.542 --> 01:34:58.750
What kind of professor uses such violence?

01:35:11.708 --> 01:35:13.125
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
FOR THE PEOPLE

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:15.875
The civic bank project began
with Mr. Jeong's sacrifice,

01:35:17.875 --> 01:35:20.125
but I don't think
it's going well right now.

01:35:24.208 --> 01:35:28.500
Starting today, we're holding off
the project temporarily.

01:35:31.167 --> 01:35:35.292
First, I want to find a new,
better way to proceed

01:35:36.083 --> 01:35:37.750
in honor of Mr. Jeong.

01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:39.458
That will be all.

01:35:41.208 --> 01:35:43.917
Mr. Jang, what did you mean
when you said it's not going well?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.875
Is it the official position of the Party?

01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:47.792
What will happen
to the civic bank project?

01:36:05.708 --> 01:36:07.625
I owe you a lot this time,

01:36:09.583 --> 01:36:11.208
Su-yeon.

01:36:13.333 --> 01:36:16.958
Don't say it like that, Ms. Lee.

01:36:18.083 --> 01:36:22.708
You sacrificed yourself
and played the lead of a crazy drama.

01:36:23.167 --> 01:36:24.167
Good work.

01:36:29.333 --> 01:36:31.458
An article was added to guarantee you

01:36:31.542 --> 01:36:33.708
the position of director
for at least five years.

01:36:34.792 --> 01:36:38.667
You've finally become the director
of Mirae Culture Center.

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:40.125
CO-DIRECTOR JASON HAN

01:36:43.167 --> 01:36:44.500
You're the director.

01:36:46.167 --> 01:36:47.708
Jason is the director, too.

01:36:48.917 --> 01:36:50.375
You're co-directors.

01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:55.625
I don't understand what you mean.

01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:59.708
When you came to me that night
and suggested tricking Yong-seok,

01:37:00.125 --> 01:37:01.833
I was a bit surprised, to be honest.

01:37:02.542 --> 01:37:06.750
I just thought you were
that desperate for the position.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.125
But why did you suggest
having Ms. Min be the vice director

01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:14.250
when you didn't even like her?

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:16.750
It seemed strange.

01:37:18.417 --> 01:37:19.958
So I called her and asked.

01:37:50.167 --> 01:37:52.208
The piece is sincere, I like it.

01:37:53.208 --> 01:37:57.333
I heard a rumor that Professor Jang
had an affair with his student.

01:37:57.917 --> 01:38:00.333
And his wife had affairs
with the culture center artists.

01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:05.125
People love gossip like this,
couple sex scandals.

01:38:07.792 --> 01:38:09.375
Jang Tae-jun

01:38:10.292 --> 01:38:12.292
keeps acting out of line.

01:38:13.875 --> 01:38:15.625
That's going to cause us trouble.

01:38:17.833 --> 01:38:21.500
So Su-yeon,
talk some sense into him, okay?

01:38:21.833 --> 01:38:24.500
It wouldn't be nice
for your husband to see this video.

01:38:25.333 --> 01:38:27.625
The relationship between
a husband and a wife is precious.

01:38:27.708 --> 01:38:29.250
Stop the bullshit.

01:38:36.250 --> 01:38:37.250
Hey,

01:38:37.917 --> 01:38:39.333
I look forward to working with you.

01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:50.208
Can't you even eat by yourself?

01:38:50.292 --> 01:38:52.792
Hey, watch your mouth.

01:38:52.875 --> 01:38:55.792
If you've eaten enough,
why don't you leave now?

01:38:56.417 --> 01:38:59.000
Since you earned lots of money,
you could pay the bill.

01:38:59.083 --> 01:39:00.417
Close the doors.

01:39:05.708 --> 01:39:07.042
So what will it be?

01:39:08.167 --> 01:39:12.208
Honestly, I'd prefer to have you
on my side than him.

01:39:12.583 --> 01:39:14.458
Jason isn't even my son.

01:39:16.208 --> 01:39:17.292
But

01:39:17.875 --> 01:39:19.708
no matter how hard you try,

01:39:20.208 --> 01:39:24.833
you can't beat a single drop
of Yong-seok's blood in him.

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:27.708
You know that, right?

01:39:50.583 --> 01:39:53.625
And you know that the reopening exhibit

01:39:53.708 --> 01:39:55.250
is important, right?

01:39:57.583 --> 01:39:59.000
So I think...

01:39:59.708 --> 01:40:04.125
It'll be hard to exhibit
Zio Shin's pieces, don't you think?

01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:06.458
Let's cancel that, okay?

01:40:08.167 --> 01:40:09.542
- Then...
- Zhou Zhang.

01:40:10.125 --> 01:40:11.925
It'll be better to stick
to the original plan.

01:40:12.542 --> 01:40:14.333
You'll help out, won't you?

01:40:17.375 --> 01:40:18.542
Oh, right.

01:40:19.917 --> 01:40:22.875
I have a copy of that video as well.

01:40:23.292 --> 01:40:25.958
I probably won't have any use for that,
but you never know.

01:40:27.708 --> 01:40:30.542
Why do people film that kind of stuff

01:40:30.625 --> 01:40:32.625
when they have no intention
of showing others?

01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:41.000
Those two people

01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:43.667
might fight over money,

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.167
but they'll always be on the same side.

01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:49.292
They could fight violently
inside the house,

01:40:49.917 --> 01:40:53.333
but they'll never let their money seep
outside their walls.

01:40:55.458 --> 01:40:57.083
They're different from people like us.

01:41:38.708 --> 01:41:39.833
Are you sleeping?

01:41:42.958 --> 01:41:44.000
Yes.

01:42:03.333 --> 01:42:04.333
Should I

01:42:05.292 --> 01:42:06.458
stop doing this?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.958
Why all of a sudden?

01:42:16.083 --> 01:42:17.375
It's just...

01:42:20.833 --> 01:42:22.583
It's just a bit hard for me.

01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:31.500
If you're drunk, get some rest.

01:42:33.375 --> 01:42:34.708
We'll talk tomorrow.

01:42:48.292 --> 01:42:49.417
Okay.

01:43:09.708 --> 01:43:12.708
ZIO SHIN

01:44:06.958 --> 01:44:09.583
If you want to change the order,
just choose the folders

01:44:10.208 --> 01:44:11.750
like I showed you last time.

01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:13.750
I don't think

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:15.875
we can do the exhibit.

01:44:19.625 --> 01:44:20.625
I'm sorry.

01:44:20.833 --> 01:44:22.500
I should be here until the end.

01:44:32.125 --> 01:44:35.500
<i>Did you know that suicide attempt</i>

01:44:36.167 --> 01:44:37.500
was the Republican Party's doing?

01:44:39.125 --> 01:44:42.250
What will you do if I knew?

01:44:43.375 --> 01:44:44.875
You should have told me.

01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:50.292
Professor, when we were
taking photos in the hospital,

01:44:52.083 --> 01:44:55.750
what did Mr. Jeong say to you?

01:44:57.042 --> 01:45:00.042
Did he even say anything?

01:45:02.833 --> 01:45:05.417
<i>Sir, how are you feeling?</i>

01:45:07.583 --> 01:45:08.583
Pardon?

01:45:09.417 --> 01:45:11.333
Give me some water.

01:45:14.917 --> 01:45:17.292
It seemed like he told you something.

01:45:21.042 --> 01:45:24.292
He thanked me. He said that the civic bank

01:45:24.375 --> 01:45:25.833
<i>must succeed.</i>

01:45:27.542 --> 01:45:29.833
The Party that manipulated
the whole incident,

01:45:30.417 --> 01:45:32.750
and you, who used that to become a star,

01:45:33.333 --> 01:45:35.750
and me, who was desperate
to keep my place.

01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:38.542
We're all the same.

01:45:39.917 --> 01:45:41.000
Now that I think of it,

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:43.833
those people were at least honest.

01:45:46.708 --> 01:45:47.833
Yes,

01:45:49.417 --> 01:45:50.750
you're right.

01:45:52.375 --> 01:45:53.500
I'm so pathetic.

01:45:55.042 --> 01:45:57.500
I made all this stupid fuss

01:45:58.042 --> 01:45:59.500
just to become a congressman.

01:46:01.667 --> 01:46:02.667
But still,

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:05.750
there are lines that you shouldn't cross.

01:46:07.208 --> 01:46:09.333
You might ignore someone who's dying,

01:46:10.292 --> 01:46:12.042
but actually killing someone...

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:14.375
That's crossing a line.

01:46:15.583 --> 01:46:17.542
Mr. Jeong didn't just die.

01:46:19.333 --> 01:46:20.750
They murdered him.

01:46:24.292 --> 01:46:25.292
I really do

01:46:26.208 --> 01:46:28.125
want to become a congressman,

01:46:29.917 --> 01:46:32.750
but I just can't work with people
who murder others.

01:46:38.708 --> 01:46:40.333
What can I do to help?

01:46:44.167 --> 01:46:45.000
SECURITY LOCKED

01:46:45.083 --> 01:46:47.167
ID CARD SECRETARY PARK EUN-JI

01:46:53.583 --> 01:46:55.625
<i>This is evidence showing
that the Republican Party</i>

01:46:55.708 --> 01:46:58.167
<i>made illegal funds
using the civic bank project.</i>

01:46:59.333 --> 01:47:00.625
<i>If this gets out,</i>

01:47:01.125 --> 01:47:03.250
<i>the project will be shut down,</i>

01:47:03.708 --> 01:47:05.750
<i>and it would affect the Party as well.</i>

01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:11.042
<i>And Mirae Group, which tried to profit
from the bank, won't get away unharmed.</i>

01:47:13.292 --> 01:47:14.458
<i>And it might</i>

01:47:15.417 --> 01:47:16.667
<i>affect you, too.</i>

01:47:26.583 --> 01:47:28.292
Hey, how do you have so many followers?

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:30.250
- It's not that many.
- It's awesome.

01:47:30.333 --> 01:47:32.917
- Let's take a photo together.
- One, two, three.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
One...

01:48:32.958 --> 01:48:35.542
This rice wine fills me up,

01:48:36.583 --> 01:48:37.792
and it's cheap, too.

01:48:39.042 --> 01:48:40.208
It's a great drink.

01:48:42.917 --> 01:48:44.833
What do you want?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.167
Money.

01:48:48.875 --> 01:48:49.958
Money?

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:52.542
Money.

01:48:54.708 --> 01:48:58.208
Right, you need money to campaign.

01:49:00.042 --> 01:49:02.208
All right, I'll give you money.

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:09.708
But

01:49:10.333 --> 01:49:13.750
you should put people before money.

01:49:16.208 --> 01:49:18.288
People who have everything
never pay for their meals.

01:49:19.167 --> 01:49:23.292
The ones who want something
should come and pay for it.

01:49:24.750 --> 01:49:26.458
I'll give you some pocket money.

01:49:27.542 --> 01:49:29.792
And keep these records,

01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:32.208
instead of cutting ties with me.

01:49:32.292 --> 01:49:33.667
I'm not making deals with you.

01:49:35.083 --> 01:49:37.542
I give you those records, get my cash,

01:49:38.458 --> 01:49:39.667
and go home.

01:49:40.375 --> 01:49:41.292
How much do you want?

01:49:41.375 --> 01:49:42.375
Thirty billion won.

01:49:42.875 --> 01:49:44.417
That idiot.

01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.542
Don't go overboard.

01:49:48.625 --> 01:49:50.417
Just give me that money!

01:49:54.083 --> 01:49:56.792
You're the one who went overboard.

01:50:07.292 --> 01:50:08.458
I don't negotiate.

01:50:10.458 --> 01:50:11.833
Do you see that?

01:50:11.917 --> 01:50:13.875
"Fixed price. Cash only."

01:50:15.583 --> 01:50:17.125
He got the spelling wrong.

01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:27.875
Do you think
they're the original documents?

01:50:38.625 --> 01:50:42.583
Would that jerk act like this
if he knew about his wife's video?

01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:45.042
This is nice.

01:50:46.958 --> 01:50:50.333
This is why people have insurances.

01:50:51.167 --> 01:50:54.083
They could get bitten
by a mad dog someday,

01:50:54.542 --> 01:50:57.125
or their pet could become a mad dog.

01:51:03.375 --> 01:51:05.417
Hey, Director Oh.

01:51:06.625 --> 01:51:09.042
<i>That video...</i>

01:51:13.542 --> 01:51:15.102
What are you doing with the lights off?

01:51:21.292 --> 01:51:22.625
This is the original.

01:51:23.667 --> 01:51:26.458
If they don't answer by tomorrow,
I'll send this to the prosecution

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.208
and finish them once and for all.
Those dirty assholes.

01:51:31.958 --> 01:51:35.083
I'm now a director.
Would you congratulate me?

01:51:37.292 --> 01:51:38.333
Congratulations.

01:51:40.917 --> 01:51:41.917
So.

01:51:43.333 --> 01:51:44.333
Stop this.

01:51:44.375 --> 01:51:46.917
- What?
- Stop all this.

01:51:49.417 --> 01:51:51.042
Did you even hear what I said?

01:51:51.125 --> 01:51:52.292
I heard you.

01:51:53.250 --> 01:51:54.250
But

01:51:54.833 --> 01:51:56.250
if you mess with Mr. Han,

01:51:56.625 --> 01:51:58.833
that puts me at risk, too.
Didn't you think of that?

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.542
Is your position

01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:08.583
that important?

01:52:08.625 --> 01:52:09.875
Yes, it is.

01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:12.625
You becoming a congressman
is important, too.

01:52:12.708 --> 01:52:13.708
Su-yeon.

01:52:14.167 --> 01:52:16.458
Just look at this first.

01:52:16.542 --> 01:52:18.333
This has nothing to do with us.

01:52:19.958 --> 01:52:21.250
What are you talking about?

01:52:21.333 --> 01:52:24.333
Thousands of people will get hurt
if I don't do anything about it.

01:52:24.958 --> 01:52:26.292
Is that so bad?

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.250
It's fine as long as we aren't harmed.

01:52:28.333 --> 01:52:31.375
Stop that. If you say anything else,
I'm going to be disappointed in you.

01:52:31.458 --> 01:52:32.708
"Disappointed"?

01:52:33.458 --> 01:52:34.583
How can you say that?

01:52:34.667 --> 01:52:36.750
Do you think life is easy now

01:52:36.875 --> 01:52:38.750
since you had a congress seat
handed to you?

01:52:39.167 --> 01:52:41.667
Do you even know what lengths people go to

01:52:41.750 --> 01:52:43.125
to get such a position?

01:52:43.208 --> 01:52:45.625
No matter how hard I try,
I can't spot an old man

01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:47.417
setting himself on fire.

01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:48.625
Oh Su-yeon!

01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:52.375
That old man died, okay?

01:52:52.583 --> 01:52:53.583
Don't you get it?

01:52:53.917 --> 01:52:56.542
- They killed him!
- That's what I mean.

01:52:57.542 --> 01:53:00.625
If you mess with Mr. Han,
do you think you'll get away with it?

01:53:01.042 --> 01:53:02.583
Who do you think you are?

01:53:04.417 --> 01:53:06.292
I'd rather get killed
than live as his slave!

01:53:06.375 --> 01:53:07.625
What about me?

01:53:09.625 --> 01:53:11.375
I've worked so hard to get here!

01:53:13.583 --> 01:53:17.458
Let's just keep living as his slaves.

01:53:22.208 --> 01:53:23.333
You're crazy.

01:53:35.292 --> 01:53:36.583
What do you think you're doing?

01:53:39.292 --> 01:53:40.292
Are you crazy?

01:53:40.333 --> 01:53:42.583
- Yes, I am crazy!
- Let go.

01:53:45.167 --> 01:53:46.292
Stop it!

01:53:57.333 --> 01:53:59.000
Damn it.

01:54:03.875 --> 01:54:05.292
Do whatever you want.

01:54:15.625 --> 01:54:16.792
<i>Are you filming me?</i>

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.542
<i>Don't film me.</i>

01:54:21.917 --> 01:54:23.542
<i>Stop that!</i>

01:54:41.625 --> 01:54:42.708
Oh Su-yeon.

01:54:45.208 --> 01:54:46.333
Come over here.

01:54:57.167 --> 01:54:58.250
Open the door!

01:55:01.458 --> 01:55:02.958
Open the door, Su-yeon!

01:55:13.542 --> 01:55:14.958
Su-yeon.

01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:22.792
She didn't tell you
she had fibroids, did she?

01:55:23.375 --> 01:55:24.375
No.

01:55:24.458 --> 01:55:27.250
She felt a lot more pain than others.

01:55:27.333 --> 01:55:30.417
She should have had surgery treatment,

01:55:31.167 --> 01:55:33.458
but she just endured it with medicine.

01:55:34.667 --> 01:55:36.250
What do you mean by surgery?

01:55:36.333 --> 01:55:37.750
Removing the uterus.

01:55:39.667 --> 01:55:41.958
But then she'd have to give up pregnancy.

01:55:47.500 --> 01:55:48.500
She is

01:55:49.167 --> 01:55:50.917
not interested in having a baby.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.500
She is.

01:55:54.875 --> 01:55:58.333
She might not have told you that,

01:55:59.667 --> 01:56:02.750
but if she wasn't interested,
she would've had the surgery.

01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:08.333
<i>Su-yeon isn't in a good state right now.</i>

01:56:26.083 --> 01:56:30.708
I guess they serve food to visitors too
since this is an ob-gyn ward.

01:56:41.667 --> 01:56:43.292
I made a mistake too.

01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:48.250
And you let it slide,

01:56:49.292 --> 01:56:51.750
so I should do the same

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.542
and let it slide, right?
I'll be cool with it.

01:56:58.167 --> 01:57:01.292
But you know, Korean men aren't cool.

01:57:02.292 --> 01:57:03.875
And I am a Korean man

01:57:05.375 --> 01:57:06.375
to the bone.

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:13.583
Should we

01:57:15.083 --> 01:57:16.292
get divorced?

01:57:17.542 --> 01:57:18.542
No.

01:57:19.083 --> 01:57:20.333
I don't want to.

01:57:32.125 --> 01:57:34.667
I'll pretend I didn't see this.

01:57:36.792 --> 01:57:39.208
At least we can be happy together.

01:57:57.125 --> 01:58:01.375
I know you're not at an age
to worry about your later years,

01:58:01.625 --> 01:58:03.333
but you should at least

01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:06.542
have some buildings bought
under your children's names.

01:58:07.208 --> 01:58:10.417
Other people seem
to like cars and buildings,

01:58:11.417 --> 01:58:13.917
but now that I'm older, I prefer nature.

01:58:15.042 --> 01:58:16.583
I want to get an island.

01:58:18.042 --> 01:58:20.583
I have several in mind in Namhae County.

01:58:24.208 --> 01:58:25.250
You really have

01:58:25.792 --> 01:58:27.000
excellent taste.

01:58:29.333 --> 01:58:32.500
Packaging the savings bank
as the civic bank was a great idea.

01:58:33.083 --> 01:58:35.958
I was worried since using savings banks
was becoming too common.

01:58:37.375 --> 01:58:41.208
And people seemed pretty interested
in the civic bank.

01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:45.833
The good thing about this nation
is that everyone feels they're lacking.

01:58:46.125 --> 01:58:49.167
Nobody thinks that they have enough money.

01:58:49.583 --> 01:58:53.417
Everyone jumps at the chance to earn more,
even if they have to go into debt.

01:58:55.542 --> 01:58:56.542
Jang Tae-jun

01:58:57.375 --> 01:58:58.625
won't be a problem, right?

01:59:00.083 --> 01:59:02.792
The good thing about this nation
is that everyone feels wronged.

01:59:02.917 --> 01:59:04.958
Nobody is satisfied with his or her place.

01:59:05.292 --> 01:59:07.792
Everyone believes
that their place is at the top.

01:59:09.125 --> 01:59:10.167
Jang Tae-jun

01:59:10.625 --> 01:59:13.458
can't teach anymore
since he's had a taste of power.

01:59:15.875 --> 01:59:18.375
That's the power of this nation.

01:59:18.708 --> 01:59:21.250
Everyone wants
what people around them have.

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:23.833
It isn't just Korea that's like this.

01:59:24.917 --> 01:59:27.250
"You shall not covet
your neighbor's wife."

01:59:28.083 --> 01:59:29.792
It's written in the Bible.

02:00:43.292 --> 02:00:45.875
Mr. Jeong, Mr. Ahn, welcome.

02:00:51.458 --> 02:00:52.542
This way, please.

02:00:55.333 --> 02:00:58.125
Here they are. Zhou Zhang...

02:01:00.250 --> 02:01:01.792
Let's look at the next piece.

02:01:06.083 --> 02:01:07.208
What's this?

02:01:10.625 --> 02:01:13.000
Jason, what's going on?

02:01:13.417 --> 02:01:15.417
This is different from the rehearsal.

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:19.000
Gosh. What's happening?

02:01:24.333 --> 02:01:25.917
What is that?

02:01:30.708 --> 02:01:32.125
I wonder what that is.

02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:43.083
It's our turn now.

02:02:44.375 --> 02:02:45.625
Are you okay with this?

02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:49.958
Yes. What about you?

02:02:53.250 --> 02:02:54.667
If you're okay,

02:02:55.792 --> 02:02:57.083
then it's okay with me.

02:03:00.292 --> 02:03:01.292
Let's go.

02:03:18.083 --> 02:03:19.292
<i>Are you filming me?</i>

02:03:20.083 --> 02:03:21.125
<i>Don't film me.</i>

02:03:21.667 --> 02:03:25.208
<i>Stop that!</i>

02:03:32.042 --> 02:03:33.875
<i>I'll film you.</i>

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:37.250
<i>Look at me.</i>

02:03:38.708 --> 02:03:40.042
<i>Come on.</i>

02:03:56.875 --> 02:03:58.750
I wanted to succeed.

02:04:00.333 --> 02:04:01.958
I wanted people to know my name,

02:04:03.208 --> 02:04:06.208
and I wanted to be the director
of this huge culture center.

02:04:09.125 --> 02:04:10.417
That desire

02:04:11.708 --> 02:04:14.167
gave me the energy to come all this way.

02:04:16.042 --> 02:04:18.167
So for this culture center's
first exhibit,

02:04:19.167 --> 02:04:20.208
my first exhibit,

02:04:24.792 --> 02:04:26.458
I chose to display this piece

02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.208
that showed my desires.

02:04:31.042 --> 02:04:34.125
<i>Don't. Stop it!</i>

02:04:34.292 --> 02:04:37.458
<i>Come on, give me the camera.</i>

02:04:37.542 --> 02:04:39.208
<i>Give me that.</i>

02:04:40.208 --> 02:04:41.583
<i>Give that to me.</i>

02:04:48.792 --> 02:04:50.125
Oh, my gosh.

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:02.958
I was blackmailed because of this video.

02:05:03.167 --> 02:05:04.333
I was afraid.

02:05:05.333 --> 02:05:07.958
I couldn't sleep, thinking about

02:05:08.833 --> 02:05:10.750
how much I could lose.

02:05:12.125 --> 02:05:14.000
I spent so many nights awake,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.375
and when dawn arrived,

02:05:18.417 --> 02:05:20.500
everything became clear to me.

02:05:26.708 --> 02:05:28.375
I was the one

02:05:28.667 --> 02:05:30.208
who held myself back.

02:05:31.958 --> 02:05:33.833
Not the ones blackmailing me.

02:05:36.042 --> 02:05:38.208
It was my desire that stopped me

02:05:40.292 --> 02:05:41.792
from letting go and moving on.

02:05:46.833 --> 02:05:47.833
I want...

02:05:49.042 --> 02:05:50.792
to find myself.

02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:53.917
I want to find freedom for myself.

02:05:58.667 --> 02:05:59.667
I own

02:06:00.167 --> 02:06:01.708
my desires.

02:06:02.583 --> 02:06:04.583
I will not become a slave of them.

02:06:11.042 --> 02:06:13.000
Do you think that I'm crazy?

02:06:15.417 --> 02:06:17.667
You might point fingers at me,
saying I'm shameless.

02:06:20.542 --> 02:06:21.667
But...

02:06:23.750 --> 02:06:25.125
I'm not ashamed.

02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:29.208
I'm proud of myself.

02:06:30.458 --> 02:06:32.042
I'm proud of myself

02:06:33.583 --> 02:06:35.083
for being shameless.

02:08:23.333 --> 02:08:26.833
You got a delivery,
but there's nothing written on it.

02:08:26.917 --> 02:08:29.667
{\an8}PROSECUTOR CHO YEONG-SEON.

02:08:31.083 --> 02:08:33.458
Mirae Group's transfer receipts,

02:08:34.042 --> 02:08:36.125
mortgage loans...

02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:38.458
They seem to be loan applications

02:08:38.542 --> 02:08:41.083
from paper companies to the civic bank.

02:08:42.792 --> 02:08:44.458
This isn't the original copy.

02:08:52.083 --> 02:08:54.500
Jang Tae-jun is a nut case too.

02:08:58.667 --> 02:09:00.417
Mr. Han Seung-hoon.

02:09:03.125 --> 02:09:05.167
Mr. Jang Tae-jun.

02:09:05.667 --> 02:09:07.333
CIVIC BANK FOUNDATION CEREMONY

02:09:07.417 --> 02:09:09.125
Mr. Lee Jung-ki.

02:09:12.125 --> 02:09:14.292
Lastly, please give a round of applause

02:09:14.792 --> 02:09:16.833
to Chairman Han of Mirae Group,

02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:20.958
who donated 30 billion won
for the civic bank.

02:09:27.125 --> 02:09:29.125
Is the suspicion
about Mr. Jeong's death true?

02:09:29.208 --> 02:09:30.708
Tell us about the incident.

02:09:30.792 --> 02:09:32.208
Are you refusing to answer?

02:09:32.292 --> 02:09:34.125
Do you admit to making illegal funds?

02:09:35.042 --> 02:09:38.083
I will answer everything truthfully
to the prosecution.

02:09:38.167 --> 02:09:40.792
- About Mirae Group's...
- Give us a comment, sir.

02:09:40.875 --> 02:09:41.875
Is that right?

02:09:43.333 --> 02:09:46.000
You're really something.
You even gave up becoming a congressman.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.667
We received the documents you sent.

02:09:50.083 --> 02:09:53.167
But we noticed that you left out
some important parts.

02:09:53.583 --> 02:09:55.417
You're not going to send
the original, right?

02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:59.000
If everything gets out

02:09:59.083 --> 02:10:01.563
and the civic bank project gets canceled,
what good will it be?

02:10:02.625 --> 02:10:04.708
Even if it's black money,

02:10:04.792 --> 02:10:06.875
isn't it better to use it
for a good cause?

02:10:07.083 --> 02:10:09.000
Are you admitting to the crime?

02:10:09.083 --> 02:10:10.625
Mr. Han, give us a comment.

02:10:10.708 --> 02:10:13.542
- Mr. Han!
- Please give us a comment.

02:10:13.625 --> 02:10:15.333
- Mr. Han!
- Give us a comment!

02:10:15.833 --> 02:10:19.375
- You're admitting to the crime, right?
- Give us a comment, Mr. Han.

02:10:19.458 --> 02:10:20.917
Just a moment, please.

02:10:21.917 --> 02:10:25.542
I was so upset since I had
no evidence to lock him up,

02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:29.000
but I hit the jackpot
when I searched his clubhouse.

02:10:29.083 --> 02:10:31.792
He'll at least be in jail for assault
and attempted murder.

02:10:33.042 --> 02:10:34.417
Mr. Han! Please say something!

02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:35.708
Mr. Han!

02:10:35.792 --> 02:10:37.000
You really are...

02:10:38.833 --> 02:10:40.083
a nut case.

02:10:42.250 --> 02:10:44.458
I don't see Director Oh Su-yeon here.

02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:46.167
She went to work.

02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:47.750
But not as the director, though.

02:12:17.542 --> 02:12:18.542
Ms. Kim.

02:16:53.916 --> 02:16:57.125
