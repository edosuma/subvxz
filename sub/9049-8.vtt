00:04.908 --> 00:07.275
Guys!

00:07.277 --> 00:09.644
The shipment of
maracas just came in!

00:09.646 --> 00:13.648
These are even nicer
than the last maracas.

00:15.686 --> 00:17.352
Ah! Check them out!

00:17.354 --> 00:19.221
Right now?

00:19.223 --> 00:21.289
Can't you see we're being
chased by a tyrannosaurus rex?

00:21.291 --> 00:23.291
- He's closing in on us!
- We're doomed!

00:23.293 --> 00:25.627
Ahhh!

00:28.431 --> 00:31.433
That screen is supposed
to be a concert simulator

00:31.435 --> 00:34.302
to help the students practice
performing in front of a crowd,

00:34.304 --> 00:37.272
not to practice running away
from prehistoric carnivores.

00:37.274 --> 00:39.975
Performing for a virtual
crowd always bums me out.

00:39.977 --> 00:43.278
Reminds me of how much I miss
performing in front of a real crowd.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.914
I can't believe Jimmy starr
still hasn't lifted the ban.

00:45.916 --> 00:49.885
Guess who got a job working
karaoke night at club-a-dub-dub?

00:49.887 --> 00:51.753
Aw, I love that place!

00:51.755 --> 00:55.457
I set the record for eating
428 chicken wings in an hour.

00:55.459 --> 00:58.360
Bones and all! Whoa!

00:58.362 --> 01:01.263
Working karaoke is the
perfect job for me.

01:01.265 --> 01:02.931
I get to sing all night.

01:02.933 --> 01:06.401
Mmm, isn't your job to get
other people to sing?

01:06.403 --> 01:09.304
Why would I do that?
They're terrible.

01:09.306 --> 01:10.972
Have you heard
people do karaoke?

01:10.974 --> 01:13.708
You haven't heard me do karaoke.
I'm great!

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.321 --> 01:26.755
Yup, sounds great now.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.914
What was wrong with
our old maracas?

02:25.916 --> 02:28.517
The beans in these
are 5% bigger.

02:28.519 --> 02:31.820
Can't you hear the difference?

02:33.389 --> 02:35.423
Hi.

02:35.425 --> 02:37.759
Oh, hi. Can we help you?

02:37.761 --> 02:39.361
Nope.

02:39.363 --> 02:41.763
That was weird.

02:41.765 --> 02:44.866
Actually yes.

02:44.868 --> 02:46.535
I'm here for singing lessons.

02:46.537 --> 02:49.404
Well, great. Let's just
sign you up right now.

02:49.406 --> 02:51.439
- Uh, what's your name?
- Ridley.

02:51.441 --> 02:52.974
You know what? Never mind.

02:52.976 --> 02:56.044
Wait, come back. There is
nothing to be scared of.

02:56.046 --> 02:58.413
Actually, there's a
lot to be scared of.

02:58.415 --> 03:00.515
You could hate my singing,
I could embarrass myself,

03:00.517 --> 03:03.485
one of those guitars could fall
on my head, aliens could attack.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.654
None of that's going to happen.

03:05.656 --> 03:08.356
Well, aliens could attack.

03:08.358 --> 03:09.591
Ignore him.

03:09.593 --> 03:11.760
I am sure you are
a great singer.

03:11.762 --> 03:14.563
So let's hear what you've got.

03:14.565 --> 03:17.098
Okay.

03:35.986 --> 03:37.786
Ridley!

03:37.788 --> 03:39.955
You have a great voice.

03:39.957 --> 03:44.826
Only, uh, I couldn't help but notice
you put on a mask before singing.

03:44.828 --> 03:47.562
Yeah.

03:49.131 --> 03:51.566
You can't be too careful.

03:51.568 --> 03:55.537
Did you know the average person
accidentally swallows 25 flies a year?

03:55.539 --> 03:58.506
Well... wait, really?

03:58.508 --> 04:00.041
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

04:00.043 --> 04:03.712
I really want to be a singer, but all
my fears keep getting in the way.

04:03.714 --> 04:06.548
Well, hang on. Why don't you
come back this afternoon?

04:06.550 --> 04:10.885
I think I have some ideas to help
conquer your fear so you can perform.

04:10.887 --> 04:14.055
Are you sure you want to waste
your time on someone as odd as me?

04:14.057 --> 04:15.590
You're not odd.

04:15.592 --> 04:19.094
I have an inflatable life vest in
my backpack in case of emergency.

04:19.096 --> 04:22.430
Okay, that's a little odd.

04:22.432 --> 04:25.667
Odd or prepared?

04:27.436 --> 04:28.903
Odd.

04:28.905 --> 04:31.072
See you later.

04:31.074 --> 04:33.708
Guys, you would not believe what
happened at work yesterday.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.677
You got fired?

04:35.679 --> 04:39.214
No, you would totally
believe that.

04:39.216 --> 04:41.716
This big hairy
lumberjack dude came in

04:41.718 --> 04:45.453
and rocked an amazing karaoke
performance of one of Austin's songs.

04:45.455 --> 04:47.689
Apparently he goes
there every night.

04:47.691 --> 04:48.823
Seriously?

04:48.825 --> 04:51.993
Yeah, he has that
Austin Moon swagger.

04:51.995 --> 04:54.829
Well the old Austin Moon
that used to perform,

04:54.831 --> 04:57.899
not the new one that just sits
around and does nothing all day.

04:59.602 --> 05:01.069
Sorry.

05:01.071 --> 05:02.804
You gotta check this guy out.

05:02.806 --> 05:04.673
Yeah, this I have to see.

05:04.675 --> 05:06.741
Come on, Austin, let's
all go tonight.

05:06.743 --> 05:08.576
Nah, I can't.

05:08.578 --> 05:11.246
I have to give my cat a bath.

05:11.248 --> 05:13.948
You don't have a cat.

05:13.950 --> 05:16.685
Right. So I gotta go buy a cat

05:16.687 --> 05:19.888
and then give it a bath.
It's gonna be a long night.

05:19.890 --> 05:21.289
See you later.

05:25.094 --> 05:26.895
That was strange.

05:26.897 --> 05:28.663
Uh, yeah.

05:28.665 --> 05:30.799
I can't believe he'd go
cat shopping without me.

05:30.801 --> 05:34.969
I hope he gets one of those fluffy,
grumpy cats with a cute, mean face.

05:34.971 --> 05:37.138
Meow!

05:37.140 --> 05:40.709
Dez, he is not getting a cat.

05:40.711 --> 05:43.011
Meow?

05:43.013 --> 05:45.747
Clearly that was just an excuse.

05:45.749 --> 05:47.782
Austin doesn't want
to go to karaoke

05:47.784 --> 05:50.585
because it hurts to see people
perform his music when he can't.

05:50.587 --> 05:53.655
I don't know, Ally. That's
pretty far-fetched.

05:53.657 --> 05:57.726
I think bathing a cat that he doesn't
even have yet makes way more sense.

06:02.665 --> 06:06.301
Okay, Ridley, I know how
overwhelming stage fright can be.

06:06.303 --> 06:07.936
I used to have it too.

06:07.938 --> 06:11.039
It's true. She was
a train wreck.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.041
It's still all over the Internet.
Want to see?

06:13.043 --> 06:13.943
Dez!

06:13.974 --> 06:17.545
I do have stage fright, but
it's not the kind you think.

06:17.547 --> 06:19.614
I'm literally afraid of stages.

06:19.616 --> 06:22.217
You can fall off, get a
drum stuck on your head.

06:22.219 --> 06:24.552
The dangers are endless.

06:24.554 --> 06:27.288
But you... you seem okay
performing in front of people.

06:27.290 --> 06:29.557
Well, not strangers.

06:29.559 --> 06:35.130
Okay, what about performing in front
of a crowd of people that you know?

06:35.132 --> 06:37.766
Ah!

06:37.768 --> 06:41.002
It's like this nightmare I
had, but instead of dezes,

06:41.004 --> 06:44.205
they were yams. I'm
terrified of yams.

06:44.207 --> 06:47.208
- Dez, do something.
- I got this.

06:47.210 --> 06:49.244
Basically the best way
to get over stage fright

06:49.246 --> 06:53.314
is to picture the audience
in their underwear.

06:53.316 --> 06:56.184
- Whoo!
- Ah!

06:56.186 --> 06:58.787
What? Now I'm going
to have nightmares.

06:58.789 --> 07:00.155
Change it, change it.

07:02.191 --> 07:05.927
Yams!

07:07.263 --> 07:09.931
Wait, come back. There's
nothing to be afraid...

07:09.933 --> 07:13.234
I think I just swallowed a fly.

07:13.236 --> 07:15.170
Did I get it?

07:19.275 --> 07:21.843
- Did you get it?
- No.

07:36.759 --> 07:40.128
Well, we only have time
for one more singer.

07:40.130 --> 07:41.729
And it's not you, Dez.

07:41.731 --> 07:44.165
Sorry nobody on the
list got to sing,

07:44.167 --> 07:48.069
but the important thing is,
I got to sing 15 songs.

07:55.911 --> 07:57.846
Is a crowd favorite.

07:57.848 --> 08:01.416
He rocks Austin Moon songs
better than Austin Moon.

08:01.418 --> 08:03.318
You know him, you love him.

08:03.320 --> 08:07.822
Club-a-dub-dub is proud once again
to present Flermy McGurgen!

08:46.363 --> 08:48.897
Let's give it up for
Flermy McGurgen!

08:51.300 --> 08:53.768
Great job, Flermy.
You did it again.

08:53.770 --> 08:55.904
That was amazing, bearded dude.

08:55.906 --> 08:58.439
Uh, thanks, strangers.

08:58.441 --> 09:01.943
So what do you think, Ally?

09:01.945 --> 09:04.379
I think...

09:05.481 --> 09:08.049
He's pretty cute.

09:14.490 --> 09:16.724
I can't believe you're
cheating on Austin

09:16.726 --> 09:19.494
in front of me with this
big hairy lumberjack!

09:20.429 --> 09:23.898
Guys, I give you
Flermy McGurgen.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.901
Okay, I'm not really
a lumberjack.

09:28.038 --> 09:30.905
Austin, you've been
secretly performing?

09:30.907 --> 09:33.741
If Jimmy finds out, do you know
how much trouble you'll be in?

09:35.878 --> 09:36.978
So?

09:36.980 --> 09:39.747
What kind of cat did you get?

09:49.024 --> 09:51.960
So Austin and Flermy are
actually the same person?

09:51.962 --> 09:54.062
It's been so obvious
the whole time.

09:54.064 --> 09:57.398
"Austin" is Flermy
spelled backwards.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.300
Nope. No, it's not.

09:59.302 --> 10:01.235
They don't even have
one letter in common.

10:01.237 --> 10:04.272
Why didn't you tell us?

10:04.274 --> 10:06.140
Well, I just couldn't
take the chance.

10:06.142 --> 10:09.110
I really miss performing
and putting on a disguise

10:09.112 --> 10:11.412
was the only way I could do it
without Jimmy starr finding out.

10:11.414 --> 10:13.881
It's like he's everywhere.

10:13.883 --> 10:16.951
Hey, look, they're
dancing to your song.

10:16.953 --> 10:18.252
Nice job, guys.

10:18.254 --> 10:20.955
But let me show you
how it's really done.

10:20.957 --> 10:23.992
Stop! No performing, Austin.

10:25.828 --> 10:28.062
Happy Birthday to my
little cousin Jessica!

10:28.064 --> 10:31.032
Now for a special treat,
Austin Moon will sing to you!

10:31.034 --> 10:34.135
Yay!

10:35.538 --> 10:37.138
No performing, Austin.

10:42.278 --> 10:45.947
Stop! No performing, Austin!

10:48.851 --> 10:52.120
Wheee!

10:55.257 --> 10:58.359
I don't think any of that
stuff actually happened.

10:58.361 --> 11:01.262
Okay, I may have
exaggerated a little.

11:01.264 --> 11:04.966
We get it. Wearing a disguise was
the only way you could sing.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.334
I still can't believe
you would even risk it.

11:06.336 --> 11:07.835
What if Jimmy catches you?

11:07.837 --> 11:08.497
I don't know!

11:08.528 --> 11:11.139
I've been going crazy not
being able to perform.

11:11.141 --> 11:14.842
Poor guy. The only time he
gets to sing is in the shower.

11:14.844 --> 11:18.980
I'm guessing. It's not like
I listen outside the door.

11:18.982 --> 11:21.883
We're having a big karaoke
competition here this weekend.

11:21.885 --> 11:23.985
Flermy McGurgen could
take home the top prize.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.520
I'm way ahead of you.

11:25.522 --> 11:27.522
I already have the
perfect song picked out.

11:27.524 --> 11:29.323
I just gotta win the contest.

11:29.325 --> 11:33.261
You know the top prize is just
a basket of chicken wings?

11:33.263 --> 11:35.296
What?

11:35.298 --> 11:37.999
I thought it was just a trophy.
That's way better!

11:38.001 --> 11:40.535
Yeah, trophies don't taste nearly
as good with buffalo sauce.

11:40.537 --> 11:42.036
Whoo!

11:47.443 --> 11:49.510
Check this out.

11:51.246 --> 11:54.916
"Enter to win the club-a-dub-dub
karaoke sing-off.

11:54.918 --> 11:57.418
"First prize is a free
basket of chicken wings."

11:57.420 --> 12:00.021
So what do you think?

12:00.023 --> 12:01.656
I think you've got a
pretty good chance.

12:01.658 --> 12:03.658
I say go for it.

12:03.660 --> 12:08.029
No, not me. I entered you
into the karaoke competition.

12:08.031 --> 12:08.925
You did what?

12:08.956 --> 12:12.500
Trust me, it is the best way
to get over your fears.

12:12.502 --> 12:15.536
I mean, performing in front of
people is my biggest dream.

12:15.538 --> 12:17.371
But it's also my
worst nightmare.

12:17.373 --> 12:19.273
I'm freaking out just
thinking about it.

12:19.275 --> 12:21.476
Oh, hey.

12:21.478 --> 12:23.678
Look.

12:25.114 --> 12:28.483
It's like getting into
a cold swimming pool.

12:28.485 --> 12:31.219
You just have to dive right in.

12:31.221 --> 12:33.221
You know how
dangerous diving is?

12:33.223 --> 12:35.089
You could bump your head,
you could belly-flop...

12:35.091 --> 12:37.291
Ridley, is there anything
you're not afraid of?

12:39.027 --> 12:41.028
Antibacterial wipes.

12:41.030 --> 12:42.697
Okay.

12:42.699 --> 12:44.365
I can work with that.

12:53.041 --> 12:53.855
Thank you.

12:53.886 --> 12:57.111
I know that's my
seventh song in a row.

12:57.113 --> 12:59.180
But tonight is not all about me.

13:15.965 --> 13:19.367
Stay tuned. The karaoke
contest is up next.

13:23.038 --> 13:24.405
I am so nervous.

13:24.407 --> 13:26.741
There's people here, I
saw a fly on the way in,

13:26.743 --> 13:28.576
and I'm not wearing
my life vest.

13:28.578 --> 13:32.079
You can do this. Just
go to your safe place.

13:32.081 --> 13:38.586
Close your eyes and imagine yourself
wrapped up in that antibacterial wipe.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.088
Is it lemon-scented?

13:41.090 --> 13:44.258
It can be whatever you want.

13:44.260 --> 13:47.228
I'm gonna go put some
more tape on my shoes.

13:47.230 --> 13:49.997
That stage looks
really slippery.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.170
Okay. Okay, yeah.

13:56.172 --> 13:58.105
Okay, Flermy.

13:58.107 --> 13:59.340
You're up first. Good luck.

13:59.342 --> 14:00.575
Thanks, Trish.

14:00.577 --> 14:03.010
One day, I hope to perform
as Austin Moon again.

14:03.012 --> 14:06.180
But until then, I really
appreciate you sticking with me.

14:06.182 --> 14:08.316
Yeah, yeah.

14:08.318 --> 14:12.019
Go wait in the club until I call you
up on stage, you hairy wildebeest.

14:14.756 --> 14:17.024
It's so moving to see a
back-country woodsman

14:17.026 --> 14:19.093
living out his dream
in the big city.

14:21.029 --> 14:22.697
Hey, Jimmy.

14:22.699 --> 14:24.065
Jimmy?

14:24.067 --> 14:26.200
What are you doing here?

14:26.202 --> 14:27.081
Nice to see you too.

14:27.112 --> 14:29.804
The owner of this club
is a friend of mine.

14:29.806 --> 14:32.440
I'm tonight's guest judge
for the karaoke contest.

14:32.442 --> 14:36.077
Man! I knew I shouldn't have fallen
asleep at the last staff meeting.

14:36.079 --> 14:38.079
I'm glad I ran into you, though.

14:38.081 --> 14:40.081
I've been wanting to talk
to you about Austin.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.149
I'm thinking of letting
him perform again.

14:42.151 --> 14:45.052
That's great news. Really?

14:45.054 --> 14:48.589
Yeah, as long as he doesn't do anything
stupid to make me change my mind.

14:48.591 --> 14:50.424
Ah. Well... well!

14:50.426 --> 14:54.562
The next time I see him, which I
have no idea when that will be,

14:54.564 --> 14:59.200
because he is nowhere near here,
I will give him the good news.

14:59.202 --> 15:02.236
Great. Well, I gotta head
over to the judge's table.

15:09.511 --> 15:11.512
Flermy?

15:11.514 --> 15:13.347
Flermy?

15:13.349 --> 15:15.383
Flermy McGurgen!

15:29.632 --> 15:32.800
Hey, he's doing an
Austin Moon song.

15:32.802 --> 15:35.536
Wow, he sounds a lot
like Austin Moon.

15:35.538 --> 15:38.806
A lot.

15:56.492 --> 16:02.129
Flermy... Jimmy... stage... career...
judge... Austin... help!

16:02.131 --> 16:03.831
I think she's trying
to tell us something.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.599
Ally, isn't it obvious?

16:05.601 --> 16:08.769
What she's trying to say is Jimmy
starr is here as a guest judge

16:08.771 --> 16:10.471
and has offered Austin the
chance to perform again

16:10.473 --> 16:12.473
if he doesn't do anything
behind his back.

16:12.475 --> 16:15.209
Of course now, if Jimmy finds
out Austin is Flermy McGurgen,

16:15.211 --> 16:18.212
he'll blow his shot at a comeback.
Duh.

16:18.214 --> 16:22.249
You got all that from, "Flermy...
Jimmy... stage... career...

16:22.251 --> 16:23.451
"judge... Austin... help"?

16:23.453 --> 16:25.286
No, I was standing right
behind the curtain

16:25.288 --> 16:28.155
when they had the conversation.
I heard the whole thing.

16:28.157 --> 16:33.294
Well, we need to get Flermy off the
stage before Jimmy figures it all out.

16:36.598 --> 16:39.567
I'm on it.

16:41.471 --> 16:44.405
Let's hear it for
Flermy McGurgen!

16:44.407 --> 16:46.173
Whoo!

16:46.175 --> 16:47.274
Hey, I wasn't done.

16:47.276 --> 16:49.276
You are now. I'm
giving you the axe.

16:49.278 --> 16:50.644
Also, here's your axe.

16:50.646 --> 16:53.647
Jimmy's here. Don't
let him see you.

17:01.223 --> 17:06.227
I'm sure we can all agree that
last guy was forgettable!

17:06.229 --> 17:08.229
So let's just all
forget about him.

17:14.202 --> 17:15.970
Whew.

17:23.246 --> 17:25.246
I don't think I can
do this, Ally.

17:25.248 --> 17:27.982
You're gonna be great. There's
nothing to worry about.

17:27.983 --> 17:31.852
Now let's give a big round of
applause for our next contestant!

17:34.257 --> 17:37.358
Oh, well, not too big.
Loud noises startle her.

17:37.898 --> 17:39.894
Well, now it just seems
like you don't like her.

17:39.896 --> 17:41.729
- Could we split the difference?
- Trish!

17:41.731 --> 17:45.633
Sorry. Uh, ladies and
gentlemen, Ridley Rogers!

17:59.948 --> 18:03.484
Psst, Ally, she's not singing.

18:03.486 --> 18:05.419
I see that, Dez.

18:05.421 --> 18:07.922
Cool, just letting you know.

18:09.291 --> 18:12.927
Ridley, just go to
your safe place.

18:12.929 --> 18:15.763
Wrap yourself in the wipe.

18:40.289 --> 18:42.756
She has a great voice.

18:42.758 --> 18:44.992
You know, I've been looking
for a new young singer.

18:44.994 --> 18:47.294
I'm gonna keep my eye on her.

19:05.982 --> 19:07.515
Yams!

19:09.451 --> 19:13.053
Yams!

19:15.724 --> 19:17.358
Whoa!

19:17.360 --> 19:18.759
Sorry.

19:21.062 --> 19:24.365
Look at that! An emergency!

19:26.369 --> 19:30.471
Flermy McGurgen.

19:30.473 --> 19:32.740
Or should I say Austin Moon?

19:32.742 --> 19:34.742
What was that?

19:34.744 --> 19:37.444
Sorry, I lost my hearing
in a lumberjack accident.

19:37.446 --> 19:40.347
Austin, I can't believe
you would defy me again.

19:40.349 --> 19:43.517
I was about to let you start
playing shows, but you blew it.

19:43.519 --> 19:46.487
Jimmy, I'm sorry. Please
give me another chance.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.390
You had a chance to do the
right thing and you didn't.

19:49.392 --> 19:50.925
You're lucky I don't
take legal action.

19:50.927 --> 19:53.794
I only did it because I
miss performing so much.

19:53.796 --> 19:56.897
Sorry. You're still banned.

19:56.899 --> 20:00.367
And I better not see Flermy
McGurgen playing anywhere either.

20:00.369 --> 20:02.670
I was confused at first as well.

20:02.672 --> 20:06.707
But Flermy and Austin are
actually the same person.

20:08.944 --> 20:11.011
- Tennis next week?
- Nope.

20:11.013 --> 20:12.146
Love that guy.

20:12.148 --> 20:15.516
I'm so sorry, Austin.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.918
I know how much
performing means to you,

20:17.920 --> 20:20.487
but don't give up. Jimmy
will change his mind

20:20.489 --> 20:23.857
and you'll be up on that stage
as Austin Moon again in no time.

20:23.859 --> 20:26.860
It's my fault. I
ruined everything.

20:26.862 --> 20:28.429
No, it's not.

20:28.431 --> 20:30.564
I took a risk and
I shouldn't have.

20:30.566 --> 20:32.566
You did a great job.

20:32.568 --> 20:34.969
Yeah, you were
awesome out there.

20:34.971 --> 20:38.839
Look, it took time for
me to overcome my fear,

20:38.841 --> 20:41.508
and it'll take time for
you to get over yours.

20:41.510 --> 20:42.977
Thanks, Ally.

20:42.979 --> 20:44.812
You know, for a
moment onstage there,

20:44.814 --> 20:48.449
I wasn't afraid of anything.
I felt amazing.

20:48.451 --> 20:50.851
Well, up until the yams.

20:50.853 --> 20:54.955
Yeah, who orders yams at
karaoke night anyway?

20:54.957 --> 20:57.558
Another round of yams, please!

20:57.560 --> 21:00.628
Well, in light of the
fact that one contestant

21:00.630 --> 21:03.597
got spooked by a yam, one
contestant got disqualified,

21:03.599 --> 21:07.801
and our celebrity judge quit, I guess
the only fair thing to do would be...

21:07.803 --> 21:09.203
reschedule the contest.

21:09.205 --> 21:12.206
No, declare myself the winner!

21:12.208 --> 21:16.510
I hereby accept these
chicken wings on my behalf.

21:16.512 --> 21:18.178
Whoo!

21:18.180 --> 21:19.913
Whooo!

21:19.915 --> 21:23.984
Whoo! Trish, Trish!

21:30.126 --> 21:34.561
Oh, yeah, the beans on the
right do sound 5% bigger.

21:36.965 --> 21:40.234
Hey, guys, since Austin can't
perform as Flermy anymore,

21:40.236 --> 21:42.603
I helped him find
a new disguise.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.071
He's unrecognizable.

21:44.073 --> 21:48.509
Oh, an old cowboy.
Austin, I love it.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.914
Ally, why are you
hugging an old cowboy?

21:55.216 --> 21:57.718
Yeah, this is my Uncle. He's
taking me to the rodeo.

21:57.720 --> 21:59.753
Aw.

21:59.755 --> 22:03.557
Sorry, buckaroo.

22:03.559 --> 22:06.026
Come on, unc. I reckon
we better mosey.

22:08.229 --> 22:11.732
Hey, guys, I just started
working on this new song.

22:11.734 --> 22:13.600
What do you think?

22:13.602 --> 22:16.870
Stop! No performing, Austin.

22:18.573 --> 22:21.508
Wheee!
