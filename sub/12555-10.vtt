00:06.089 --> 00:08.342
<i>(male presenter)
THERE IS A FIFTH DIMENSION</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:10.841
<i>BEYOND THAT WHICH
IS KNOWN TO MAN.</i>

00:10.928 --> 00:14.011
<i>IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE</i>

00:14.097 --> 00:16.839
<i>AND AS TIMELESS
AS INFINITY.</i>

00:16.934 --> 00:20.177
<i>IT IS THE MIDDLE GROUND
BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:22.557
<i>BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION</i>

00:22.648 --> 00:25.561
<i>AND IT LIES BETWEEN
THE PIT OF MAN'S FEARS</i>

00:25.651 --> 00:28.609
<i>AND THE SUMMIT
OF HIS KNOWLEDGE.</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:31.437
<i>THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:31.532 --> 00:35.275
<i>IT IS AN AREA WHICH WE
CALL THE TWILIGHT ZONE.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:46.376
<i>HER NAME IS THE
S.S. QUEEN OF GLASGOW.</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:49.584
<i>HER REGISTRY.' BRITISH.
GROSS TONNAGE.' 5,000.</i>

00:49.675 --> 00:51.632
<i>AGE.' INDETERMINATE.</i>

00:51.718 --> 00:54.380
<i>AT THIS MOMENT, SHE'S ONE
DAY OUT OF LIVERPOOL.</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:56.887
<i>HER DESTINATION.' NEW YORK.</i>

00:56.974 --> 01:00.092
<i>DULY RECORDED ON THIS SHIP'S

<i>COURSE TO DESTINATION,
WEATHER CONDITIONS,</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:04.720
<i>TEMPERATURE, LONGITUDE
AND LATITUDE.</i>

01:04.815 --> 01:07.398
<i>BUT WHAT IS NEVER
RECORDED IN A LOG</i>

01:07.442 --> 01:12.437
<i>IS THE FEAR THAT WASHES OVER A
DECK LIKE FOG AND OCEAN SPRAY.</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:17.571
<i>FEAR LIKE THE THROBBING STROKES OF
ENGINE PISTONS, EACH LIKE A HEARTBEAT,</i>

01:17.619 --> 01:21.237
<i>PARCELING OUT EVERY HOUR INTO
BREATHLESS MINUTES OF WATCHING,</i>

01:21.290 --> 01:23.907
<i>WAITING AND DREADING.</i>

01:23.959 --> 01:26.417
<i>FOR THE YEAR IS 1942.</i>

01:26.461 --> 01:29.453
<i>AND THIS PARTICULAR SHIP
HAS LOST ITS CONVOY.</i>

01:29.548 --> 01:32.256
<i>IT TRAVELS ALONE
LIKE AN AGED BLIND THING</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:34.754
<i>GROPING THROUGH
THE UNFRIENDLY DARK</i>

01:34.845 --> 01:38.839
<i>STALKED BY UNSEEN PERISCOPES

01:38.932 --> 01:41.640
<i>YES, THE QUEEN OF GLASGOW
IS A FRIGHTENED SHIP,</i>

01:41.727 --> 01:46.346
<i>AND SHE CARRIES WITH HER
A PREMONITION OF...DEATH.</i>

02:04.499 --> 02:06.490
LIGHTS IN THE SALON.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.452
LET'S BLACKOUT DOWN THERE.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.297
<i>SIR?</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:18.503
THEY'LL BE FINISHED
SERVING DINNER SOON, SIR.

02:18.597 --> 02:21.806
YOU'D BEST GO IN
IF YOU WANT TO EAT.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.428
THANK YOU.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.679
YES, SIR.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.789
THANK YOU.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.830
ARE YOU LANSER?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.544
YES.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.002
JERRY POTTER. VVE LOOKED
FOR YOU AT DINNER.

02:59.054 --> 03:02.718
SAVV YOUR NAME ON THE PURSER'S LIST.
VVE VVERE VVONDERING VVHERE YOU VVERE.

03:02.808 --> 03:06.392
THE CAPTAIN VVASN'T ABLE TO JOIN US
TONIGHT. COME OVER AND HAVE DESSERT.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.095
THANK YOU, NO.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.226
HOW ABOUT SOME
COFFEE, SIR?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.933
THANK YOU, I <i>WOULD</i>
LIKE A CUP OF COFFEE.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.359
HERE'S YOUR SEAT RIGHT OVER HERE, MR.
LANSER.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.897
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.776
VVE COULD DO VVITH A
BIT OF MERRIMENT.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.780
I'LL DO THE HONORS.
THIS IS MAJOR DEVEREAUX.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.406
HOW DO YOU DO?

03:25.497 --> 03:27.329
<i>AND HIS SECRETARY,
MISS STANLEY.</i>

03:27.416 --> 03:31.034
ARE YOU HEADING HOME, MR.
LANSER, OR AVVAY FROM HOME?

03:31.128 --> 03:35.747
WHY, I'M...HEADING
AWAY FROM HOME.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.250
UM, WHAT DO
YOU DO, LANSER?

03:39.344 --> 03:41.585
ME?

03:41.680 --> 03:45.048
I SAVV YOUR NAME ON THE LIST. I TRIED
TO FIGURE OUT VVHAT YOU LOOKED LIKE.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.556
IT'S A GAME I PLAY.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.975
I TRY TO CONNECT
A FACE WITH A NAME.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.976
I THOUGHT PROBABLY YOU VVERE
AN OLD LANGUAGE PROFESSOR

03:53.066 --> 03:55.273
FROM OXFORD
OR SOMETHING.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.320
AH, HERE COMES
THE CAPTAIN.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.902
OH, NO, NO, NO.
PLEASE, DON'T GET UP.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.914
I HAVEN'T MUCH TIME. I JUST VVANTED
TO SAY HELLO TO SOME OF YOU.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.789
<i>I DO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING
ABLE TO GET DOWN TO DINNER.</i>

04:13.879 --> 04:16.337
WE HAVE A MISERABLE
FOG OUT THERE,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.915
AND I THOUGHT IT BEST TO
TAKE MY MEAL ON THE BRIDGE.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.675
<i>AND THE REST OF THE CONVOY,
CAPTAIN, ARE THEY IN SIGHT?</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:24.595
<i>THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE THREE FEET
OFF THE BOW TO BE IN SIGHT, MAJOR.</i>

04:24.681 --> 04:27.093
THAT FOG OUT THERE
IS VERY THICK.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.972
<i>WE HAVE SOME HOPES OF MAKING
CONTACT WITH THEM TOMORROW.</i>

04:30.061 --> 04:32.803
I'D FEEL MUCH SAFER
IF WE WERE IN CONVOY.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.935
I CAN ALMOST SEE
THOSE WOLF PACKS--

04:35.025 --> 04:38.017
ISN'T THAT VVHAT YOU CALL THEM?
CONVERGING ON US.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.695
THERE'LL BE NO VVOLF PACKS CONVERGING
ON A SINGLE SHIP, MAJOR DEVEREAUX.

04:41.782 --> 04:46.276
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SUBMARINE PACK
IS BASED ON THE CONVOY ATTACK.

04:46.369 --> 04:50.704
THE GENTLEMAN IS QUITE CORRECT. OUR PRINCIPAL
DANGER VVOULD LIE IN A SINGLE SUBMARINE.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.873
I'LL TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.122
I'D RATHER THEY GO AFTER US IN
ONE OF THOSE POCKET BATTLESHIPS.

04:56.171 --> 05:00.335
THAT YOU CAN SEE. NOT A
SKULKING, CRUMMY TIN FISH

05:00.425 --> 05:02.336
A COUPLE OF MILES
UNDER WATER.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.964
IF YOU'RE BEING FOLLOVVED,
YOU'LL SEE THE SUB, MR. POTTER.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.843
IT VVILL SURFACE. THEY VVON'T USE
ALL OF THEIR TORPEDOES ON US.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.096
<i>NOT WHEN THEY CONSIDER THE THOUSAND
YARDS AND SHELL US WITH IMPUNITY</i>

05:11.186 --> 05:13.268
AND SINK US AT WILL.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.022
YOU'LL FORGIVE
ME, MISTER--

05:18.109 --> 05:20.396
THIS IS
MR. LANSER, CAPTAIN.

05:20.487 --> 05:24.321
<i>MR. LANSER, BUT YOU SOUND
RATHER LIKE A U-BOAT COMMANDER.</i>

05:30.497 --> 05:34.035
FORGIVE ME. THAT
WAS CLUMSY OF ME.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.503
I HOPE I DIDN'T GET ANY
ON YOU, MISS STANLEY.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.250
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T GET ANY ON ME, BUT
YOU DID QUITE A JOB ON YOURSELF THERE.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.501
THAT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.706
IT'LL STAIN, SIR.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.509
I SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT!

05:45.595 --> 05:48.007
<i>(Steward)
YES, SIR.</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:51.011
<i>AS YOU SAY, SIR. CAN I GET
YOU SOME MORE COFFEE?</i>

05:51.101 --> 05:53.092
NO, THANK YOU. THAT
WON'T BE NECESSARY.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.847
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.602
WON'T YOU PLEASE SIT
DOWN, MR. LANSER?

06:01.361 --> 06:04.945
<i>WELL, I THINK WE CAN START TO
GET BETTER ACQUAINTED NOW.</i>

06:05.031 --> 06:07.944
<i>FIRST OF ALL, I HOPE YOUPEALL
AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.</i>

06:08.034 --> 06:10.617
<i>THIS SHIP WAS NOT DESIGNED
TO CARRY PASSENGERS.</i>

06:10.704 --> 06:13.571
<i>AND I HOPE YOU'LL BEAR WITH
ANY LITTLE INCONVENIENCES.</i>

06:13.665 --> 06:16.748
<i>MR. POTTER, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE
WITH THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT?</i>

06:16.835 --> 06:18.917
<i>WAR PRODUCTION BOARD.</i>

06:19.004 --> 06:21.291
<i>AND WHERE IS
HOME, MR. POTTER?</i>

06:21.381 --> 06:24.590
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.
THE WINDY CITY.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.043
I'LL TELL YOU I'LL BE GLAD
TO GET TO SEE HER, TOO.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.050
<i>AND YOU, MR. LANSER?</i>

06:30.140 --> 06:32.051
<i>WHERE IS HOME FOR YOU?</i>

06:34.227 --> 06:37.060
HOME?

06:37.147 --> 06:38.808
UH--

06:38.899 --> 06:41.482
I WAS BORN IN FRANKFURT.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.981
FRANKFURT? FRANKFURT,
LIKE IN GERMANY?

06:45.071 --> 06:48.405
YES, GERMANY.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.778
HOW LONG HAD YOU
BEEN IN ENGLAND?

06:50.869 --> 06:54.362
HOW LONG? UH--

06:57.375 --> 06:59.628
NOT VERY LONG.

06:59.711 --> 07:03.750
AND NOT LONG AT ALL.

07:05.842 --> 07:09.460
UH, PLEASE FORGIVE ME. I'M
NOT FEELING VVELL TODAY.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.670
I THINK I'D BETTER
GO TO MY CABIN.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.928
THAT'S TOO BAD, LANSER. I VVAS HOPING
VVE MIGHT GET UP A POKER GAME.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.804
PERHAPS LATER,
IF YOU FEEL BETTER.

07:16.895 --> 07:18.852
YES, PERHAPS LATER,
GOOD NIGHT.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.429
GOOD NIGHT,
MR. LANSER.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.064
GOOD NIGHT.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.157
MISS STANLEY?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.002
THE FOG CARRIES A CHILL
WITH IT, DOESN'T IT?

07:44.089 --> 07:46.046
YES, YES, IT DOES.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.169
HAVE WE MET BEFORE?

07:48.259 --> 07:49.715
I DON'T THINK SO.

07:49.803 --> 07:53.171
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.006
YOU LOOKED SO FAMILIAR.

07:58.103 --> 08:01.721
BUT FOR THAT MATTER,
THEY ALL DID.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.681
MR. LANSER, ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:03.775 --> 08:05.641
YES, YES,
I'M ALL RIGHT.

08:05.735 --> 08:09.228
IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE
THESE CRAZY FEELINGS.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.609
WHAT?

08:11.700 --> 08:14.158
A FEELING
OF DOING THINGS,

08:14.244 --> 08:16.030
SAYING THINGS.

08:16.121 --> 08:18.704
A FEELING THAT YOU'VE
DONE THEM BEFORE?

08:18.790 --> 08:21.999
I KNOW THAT FEELING.
I'VE HAD IT OCCASIONALLY.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.076
BEING IN A ROOM SOMEWHERE

08:24.170 --> 08:27.208
AND BEING ABLE TO SVVEAR THAT
YOU'D BEEN THERE BEFORE.

08:27.298 --> 08:32.384
EVEN THE CONVERSATION SEEMS
IDENTICAL TO ANOTHER TIME.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.211
AND THE PEOPLE?

08:34.304 --> 08:37.013
YES, AND THE PEOPLE, TOO.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.974
HOW ODD.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.097
I DON'T SEEM TO RECALL.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.604
I DON'T SEEM TO RECALL

08:48.695 --> 08:51.904
GETTING ON THIS SHIP

08:51.990 --> 08:55.779
OR ANYTHING ELSE
FOR THAT MATTER.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.783
IT'S SUDDENLY AS IF I VVOKE UP AND
FOUND MYSELF STANDING ON DECK

08:59.873 --> 09:03.411
AND HEARING YOUR VOICES

09:03.501 --> 09:05.458
COMING FROM THE SALON.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.910
LIKE AMNESIA?

09:07.005 --> 09:09.542
NO, NOT REALLY.
I KNOW WHO I AM.

09:09.591 --> 09:12.925
I'M CARL LANSER.
I AM CARL LANSER.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.094
I VVAS BORN IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY.
I AM IN THE-

09:17.807 --> 09:19.548
IN THE WHAT?

09:19.642 --> 09:21.895
IN THE WHAT?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.436
YOU WERE GOING
TO TELL ME.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.640
YOU WERE IN
SOMETHING OR OTHER.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.351
WHO WAS I?

09:32.238 --> 09:34.775
I DON'T REMEMBER.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.984
MR. LANSER, PERHAPS
IF YOU GOT SOME SLEEP.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.321
NO, SLEEP COULDN'T HELP ME. I
DON'T THINK I COULD GET TO SLEEP.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.655
I FEEL AS IF-

09:43.750 --> 09:47.960
AS lF...l'M
IN A NIGHTMARE.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.413
IT'S SO STRANGE.

09:50.507 --> 09:54.592
I FEEL AS IF THERE'S
DISASTER OUT THERE.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.594
DOOM.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.138
WE ARE BEING STALKED.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.843
I KNOW WE'RE
BEING STALKED.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.100
THERE IS A SUB
OUT THERE, A U-BOAT.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.851
I KNOW.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.684
I KNOW IT'S THERE.
I KNOW IT.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.815
<i>MR. LANSER?</i>

10:13.905 --> 10:16.317
I'M LANSER.

10:16.407 --> 10:20.196
THE CAPTAIN'S COMPLIMENTS, SIR. HE VVONDERS
IF YOU'D COME VVITH ME TO THE BRIDGE.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.118
HE'D LIKE TO HAVE
A FEW WORDS WITH YOU.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.616
CERTAINLY.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.576
WILL YOU FOLLOW
ME, PLEASE, SIR?

10:30.797 --> 10:33.129
THANK YOU FOR
COMING UP, MR. LANSER.

10:33.174 --> 10:37.042
I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND
ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.469
NO, NO. NOT AT ALL.

10:39.514 --> 10:42.802
FIRST OF ALL, VVOULD YOU MIND
SHOVVING ME YOUR PASSPORT?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.883
MY-MY PASSPORT?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.015
YES, IF YOU
DON'T MIND.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.517
JUST ROUTINE, SIR.
ON OUR PASSENGER MANIFEST

10:49.607 --> 10:52.690
IT SEEMS THAT YOUR PASSPORT
NUMBER VVAS NOT PUT DOVVN.

10:52.777 --> 10:57.146
I'M AFRAID I DON'T HAVE MY VVALLET VVITH
ME HERE. I MUST'VE LEFT IT IN MY CABIN.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.653
IT'S ALL RIGHT. SOMETIME IN THE
NEXT FEVV DAYS YOU SHOVV IT TO ME.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.996
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
MR. LANSER? I MEAN,

11:03.079 --> 11:06.822
IS THERE ANYTHING, VVELL, ANYTHING
THAT YOU VVANT TO TELL US?

11:06.875 --> 11:11.210
THERE IS VERY LITTLE THAT I CAN TELL
YOU AS I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.503
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
HOW I GOT ON THIS SHIP.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.585
I DON'T RECALL
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

11:15.675 --> 11:20.670
I SEEM TO REMEMBER ONLY
ODD, DISJOINTED THINGS.

11:20.763 --> 11:24.256
I KNOVV FOR EXAMPLE THAT
MY NAME IS CARL LANSER.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.933
I KNOW THAT I WAS
BORN IN FRANKFURT.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.351
GO ON, MR. LANSER.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.012
GO ON, GO ON, HOW?

11:30.064 --> 11:33.193
IT SEEMS TO BE
ALL THAT I KNOW.

11:33.234 --> 11:37.398
VVELL, AT THE TABLE YOU SEEMED TO SHOVV
A REMARKABLE VVORKING KNOVVLEDGE

11:37.488 --> 11:40.025
OF GERMAN SUBMARINES.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.611
COULD THAT PERHAPS
GIVE YOU A THOUGHT?

11:44.996 --> 11:48.114
I'M AFRAID IT COULDN'T.
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.918
GO TO BED, MR. LANSER. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT'S
REST. VVE'LL TALK TOMORROVV, YOU AND I.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.620
ALL RIGHT.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.457
THAT'S ALL, MR. LANSER.
GOODNIGHT.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.337
GOODNIGHT.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.137
ODD. VERY ODD.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.435
I'D SAY THAT
HE BEARS WATCHING.
