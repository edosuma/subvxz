- Xiang Xinran
-Mom

00:59.917 --> 01:01.001
Hey!

01:01.209 --> 01:02.334
You two!

01:02.917 --> 01:03.709
Mom

01:04.542 --> 01:06.001
Come Qianjin

01:06.417 --> 01:08.959
- Hey!Go Away!
-Why should I?

01:08.959 --> 01:10.251
- Just move!
-I'm not going!

01:10.251 --> 01:11.459
- Go!
-Come here.

01:11.459 --> 01:13.626
- This is my seat!
-Okay, sit still.

01:13.626 --> 01:14.376
You are so annoying.

01:14.376 --> 01:15.792
I'm your big sister, you must listen to me.

01:15.959 --> 01:18.251
Okay, look at the front.

01:18.876 --> 01:19.792
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.959
One, two, three!

02:03.209 --> 02:05.292
Look right here, please.

02:50.084 --> 02:53.334
"Non-Appreciation of Old People"

02:56.126 --> 02:57.126
Students

02:59.001 --> 02:59.959
The elderly,

03:01.042 --> 03:03.084
they are in every household

03:04.001 --> 03:05.876
Today, let's talk about the elderly

03:06.209 --> 03:07.126
OK

03:07.126 --> 03:08.667
So, who wants to describe the elderly?

03:09.084 --> 03:10.209
The older they are, the uglier

03:10.709 --> 03:12.126
They don't take good care of themselves...

03:12.126 --> 03:13.501
...when they're younger

03:13.501 --> 03:15.292
When they fall, nobody dares to help them up

03:15.292 --> 03:17.209
All their teeth are gone,
so they can't eat anything

03:17.209 --> 03:18.334
They eat so slowly...

03:18.334 --> 03:19.292
...and still talk on and on

03:19.292 --> 03:21.501
They move so sluggishly
and become a burden to everybody

03:21.501 --> 03:23.501
They worry about everything
and anything you do offends them

03:23.501 --> 03:25.001
They're senile

03:25.001 --> 03:26.209
And wet their pants

03:27.042 --> 03:29.251
They expect people to give up
their seats on buses

03:29.251 --> 03:30.542
Well, you pretend to be asleep

03:32.459 --> 03:34.334
Quiet

03:35.001 --> 03:36.251
Senior Citizen's Card

04:07.917 --> 04:09.167
You continue napping

04:09.167 --> 04:11.501
I'll provide some shade,
it'll be more comfortable

04:14.334 --> 04:15.959
What on earth is going on?

04:21.125 --> 04:23.001
Everything that has been said...

04:23.001 --> 04:25.001
...has been about their shortcomings

04:25.584 --> 04:27.709
It seems nobody wants to spend time
with the elderly

04:28.542 --> 04:30.167
But have you ever considered...

04:30.626 --> 04:33.084
...that one day you too will become old?

04:35.209 --> 04:37.251
Who here knows how to fight aging?

04:37.251 --> 04:38.417
More exercise

04:39.126 --> 04:40.084
That is one way

04:40.292 --> 04:41.959
Take good care of ourselves early

04:41.959 --> 04:43.042
Why not just go to Korea...

04:43.042 --> 04:44.542
For botox?

04:47.667 --> 04:49.334
Think harder

04:49.334 --> 04:52.084
ls there any other way to prevent
ourselves from aging?

04:54.501 --> 04:55.542
Nobody has said it

04:56.376 --> 04:57.501
It seems I need to call on students

04:59.042 --> 05:00.084
So I Will

05:00.084 --> 05:00.917
Xiang

05:00.917 --> 05:01.667
Xin

05:01.667 --> 05:02.834
Ran

05:04.084 --> 05:05.376
Xiang Xinran

05:06.876 --> 05:08.001
Xiang Xinran

05:08.001 --> 05:09.876
Come, stand up and answer my question

05:10.417 --> 05:11.167
He's calling on you

05:11.167 --> 05:12.459
Xiang Xinran

05:12.584 --> 05:14.876
Please stand up and answer my question

05:17.126 --> 05:19.709
What can be done to postpone aging?

05:20.792 --> 05:22.084
What else is there?

05:22.292 --> 05:23.084
Worst comes to worst,

05:23.084 --> 05:26.417
I'll just kill myself after thirty

05:26.542 --> 05:28.084
At the time, I really felt that way

05:28.167 --> 05:29.167
3 Bamboos

05:29.417 --> 05:30.292
Kong

05:31.792 --> 05:33.501
Wasn't I pretty in my youth?

05:33.501 --> 05:34.376
Very

05:34.959 --> 05:36.292
Wasn't I a good singer?

05:36.292 --> 05:37.126
Yes

05:39.001 --> 05:41.001
Hurry up, it's almost dark

05:41.001 --> 05:42.501
What's the rush? Five Bamboos

05:42.501 --> 05:43.417
Kong

05:43.959 --> 05:44.751
What?!

05:44.751 --> 05:46.084
Back when you were thirty,

05:46.084 --> 05:47.792
I really should have given you a hand

05:47.917 --> 05:49.459
I didn't need it

05:49.542 --> 05:53.167
If I wasn't so worried about our Guobin,

05:53.209 --> 05:54.667
my noose would have been ready

05:55.626 --> 05:56.751
Are you serious?

05:57.167 --> 05:58.167
No

05:59.167 --> 06:01.834
If I died, what would happen to Guobin?

06:02.001 --> 06:04.376
Back then, life was so difficult

06:04.709 --> 06:06.042
Looking back now,

06:06.292 --> 06:08.334
forty years gone in a flash

06:08.667 --> 06:10.417
I've suffered it all

06:10.751 --> 06:12.042
Did I ever complain?

06:12.209 --> 06:13.626
You shouldn't

06:14.042 --> 06:17.626
Didn't you insist on marrying Guobin's father?

06:17.751 --> 06:18.751
TRUE

06:19.001 --> 06:20.751
I may have married the wrong man,

06:21.167 --> 06:23.001
but I gave birth to the right one

06:23.376 --> 06:25.334
Our Guobin is not only handsome,

06:25.417 --> 06:26.667
he takes care of me,

06:27.209 --> 06:28.876
and he's a college professor

06:29.376 --> 06:31.084
What about your kids?

06:33.709 --> 06:34.542
Let's play

06:34.542 --> 06:35.584
Seven Character

06:39.959 --> 06:41.167
Your tiles...

06:41.959 --> 06:44.542
Old Li, you are looking at two players' tiles

06:44.959 --> 06:46.334
That's not fair

06:47.876 --> 06:49.292
Just because your son is a loser,

06:49.917 --> 06:51.167
don't take it out on Old Li

06:51.167 --> 06:52.417
What about my son?

06:53.584 --> 06:55.001
What a mess...

06:55.042 --> 06:56.251
Who are you talking about?

06:56.251 --> 06:58.584
Who? What has my son ever done to you?

06:58.834 --> 07:00.751
I'm talking about my tiles

07:00.792 --> 07:02.542
Everybody knows about Guobin already

07:02.542 --> 07:03.501
Professor at a top university

07:03.501 --> 07:04.334
Exactly

07:04.334 --> 07:05.292
Let's play

07:05.376 --> 07:07.209
Exactly, what did I say wrong?

07:07.376 --> 07:08.417
Our Guobin...

07:08.417 --> 07:11.042
...specializes in researching social issues
of the elderly

07:11.334 --> 07:13.042
If it wasn't for him,

07:13.334 --> 07:16.542
this place would have become a real estate
agency long ago

07:16.584 --> 07:18.584
Then where would you all be playing mahjong?

07:19.167 --> 07:19.959
Green Dragon

07:21.334 --> 07:22.751
- Seven Bamboos
-Mahjong

07:23.209 --> 07:25.167
Pure hand, two Kongs

07:26.584 --> 07:29.751
You knew she wanted Bamboos,
why keep offering them?

07:29.751 --> 07:31.209
Do you even know how to play?

07:31.209 --> 07:33.126
It was a lone tile

07:33.126 --> 07:34.292
Why'd you do that?!

07:34.292 --> 07:35.751
He played it right

07:35.751 --> 07:37.751
I could tell that you were building a pure hand

07:37.751 --> 07:39.667
When she played Seven Character,
why not declare mahjong?

07:39.667 --> 07:40.792
You wanted a self-drawn win

07:41.667 --> 07:43.042
You deserve to lose

07:44.626 --> 07:47.501
What kind of playing style is this?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.751
6-6-8 Bamboos?

07:50.084 --> 07:51.501
How can this be a winning hand?

07:52.417 --> 07:53.334
Wait a minute

07:54.042 --> 07:56.001
This doesn't count

07:56.334 --> 07:57.167
I don't believe it

07:57.167 --> 07:59.959
- You owe us three money
-Hand over the money

08:00.001 --> 08:01.959
I wanted to remind you just now

08:01.959 --> 08:03.792
I...

08:03.792 --> 08:04.834
...just read the tile wrong

08:04.834 --> 08:05.876
Who plays like that?

08:05.876 --> 08:06.959
Let's restart

08:06.959 --> 08:08.792
I'm done

08:08.876 --> 08:10.751
I've got to make dinner for my son

08:11.042 --> 08:13.251
Even if my son is a loser,
he still needs food after all

08:13.251 --> 08:15.126
Don't be a sore loser

08:15.126 --> 08:16.001
I can't play anymore

08:16.001 --> 08:17.167
Young man

08:17.167 --> 08:18.751
You people,

08:18.959 --> 08:20.251
if you don't want to play, whatever

08:20.709 --> 08:23.126
- Can I help you? Aunt Chen
-My dog is thirsty

08:23.126 --> 08:24.751
Bring him some water

08:25.084 --> 08:26.042
Mineral water

08:26.042 --> 08:27.251
Ok, I'll take care of it

08:27.792 --> 08:30.917
All day I hear Guobin this, Guobin that

08:30.917 --> 08:33.417
It's enough to drive me insane

08:33.501 --> 08:36.083
You dare talk about Guobin like that?

08:36.208 --> 08:39.333
If your Guobin is so exceptional,

08:39.708 --> 08:42.251
how can he bear to see you wear...

08:42.292 --> 08:43.917
...such shabby shoes?

08:44.208 --> 08:45.126
Good ventilation

08:48.792 --> 08:49.792
Brother Li

08:50.459 --> 08:52.001
Let me show you something

08:55.334 --> 08:56.292
Here

08:56.417 --> 08:58.376
This is my passport photo

08:58.501 --> 08:59.542
It looks very nice

09:00.876 --> 09:03.542
Looks nice, my ass! What a ghastly face

09:03.584 --> 09:05.501
It would look great on your funeral altar

09:06.001 --> 09:06.751
Brother Li

09:06.751 --> 09:08.542
You can have the photo if you like it

09:08.542 --> 09:10.751
Where are you going?

09:11.292 --> 09:13.251
I'm going to America

09:13.459 --> 09:16.084
My daughter calls me every day...

09:16.084 --> 09:18.167
...begging me to stay with her awhile there

09:18.167 --> 09:19.084
So what

09:19.334 --> 09:21.876
But there's nobody to care for my dog

09:23.792 --> 09:24.751
Brother Li

09:24.751 --> 09:27.376
Why don't you help me while I'm gone?

09:27.584 --> 09:29.709
I can't, I don't know how to care for a dog

09:29.709 --> 09:30.917
I don't know how to care for a dog

09:33.292 --> 09:35.876
I think you should hurry over to America

09:35.876 --> 09:39.126
Have your foreign son-in-law take care
of the dog

09:39.917 --> 09:43.001
I do what I want, none of your business

09:43.001 --> 09:45.001
You don't even own a passport

09:45.001 --> 09:46.001
If you're so great,
why don't you have your son...

09:46.001 --> 09:48.251
...take you to tour around America?

09:49.001 --> 09:50.167
Let me tell you something

09:50.167 --> 09:51.251
Say what you want about me...

09:51.251 --> 09:52.917
...but don't talk about my son

09:53.751 --> 09:54.709
What?

09:55.001 --> 09:56.459
Want to fight?

09:57.459 --> 09:59.417
I say what I want, so what?

09:59.417 --> 10:01.209
Bullshit professor at a bullshit university

10:01.209 --> 10:01.876
Let's stop this

10:01.876 --> 10:03.251
You old hag,

10:03.501 --> 10:04.709
keep on talking

10:05.084 --> 10:06.001
So what?

10:06.001 --> 10:08.126
What? Go on? Hit me!

10:09.667 --> 10:11.917
Stop grabbing me, I can't stand you

10:13.209 --> 10:14.292
Keep bragging

10:14.626 --> 10:15.251
Don't touch me

10:15.251 --> 10:16.876
Stop pulling my hair

10:16.876 --> 10:18.376
Stop it

10:18.376 --> 10:19.334
Let go

10:20.376 --> 10:21.417
Keep bragging

10:22.126 --> 10:23.417
Where is my wig?

10:23.751 --> 10:25.542
Over here

10:25.542 --> 10:26.876
Pretty eh?

10:27.959 --> 10:30.167
Over here, how about now?

10:30.167 --> 10:32.209
Give it back you damned hag

10:33.084 --> 10:34.917
You damned hag

10:36.834 --> 10:38.709
Pretty huh?

10:38.709 --> 10:40.334
Look how pretty you are, seriously!

10:42.292 --> 10:44.251
You say she's how old already?

10:44.459 --> 10:46.126
All she does is cause trouble

10:47.876 --> 10:49.334
It's not enough that she acts like this,

10:49.334 --> 10:50.709
but she has to drag you into it too

10:51.334 --> 10:53.667
It wasn't madam's fault

10:54.167 --> 10:55.876
Calling her madam?

10:57.126 --> 10:58.084
Listen

10:58.334 --> 11:00.542
It's been how long...

11:00.667 --> 11:02.042
...since you last worked for their family?

11:02.626 --> 11:05.292
I'm very much indebted to them

11:05.834 --> 11:06.834
That was decades ago

11:07.001 --> 11:08.751
You've already paid your dues

11:08.792 --> 11:10.667
Can't you contain her just a little?

11:10.667 --> 11:12.709
This time it's your nose

11:12.709 --> 11:13.834
Next time, who knows, will it be your head?

11:13.834 --> 11:14.792
Shut up

11:17.042 --> 11:19.751
I was talking to Batman, go on

11:22.917 --> 11:23.626
Sit

11:24.251 --> 11:25.542
A forty year old...

11:25.792 --> 11:27.084
...holed up at home all day.

11:27.084 --> 11:28.542
It's no surprise you're still single

11:29.084 --> 11:31.126
Do you plan on living with your dad forever?

11:31.834 --> 11:33.667
Auntie Shen, just look...

11:33.667 --> 11:35.251
...at my dad's injuries

11:35.292 --> 11:36.376
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

11:36.376 --> 11:38.001
Of course

11:38.501 --> 11:40.334
Who asked you to intervene anyways?

11:40.376 --> 11:41.751
You just got in the way

11:42.292 --> 11:43.792
Everything he did was for your sake

11:43.792 --> 11:46.667
Here, wash these for your dad

11:47.292 --> 11:48.417
He doesn't eat peaches

11:49.292 --> 11:50.751
- Let me see
-Here

11:53.917 --> 11:55.709
- Dad you...
-Very sweet

11:57.959 --> 11:59.209
Leaving already?

11:59.209 --> 12:01.001
The rerun for Princess Huanzhu
is about to start

12:01.001 --> 12:02.126
Why don't you watch before leaving?

12:02.417 --> 12:03.709
I don't see the princess

12:04.126 --> 12:06.001
But there is a Rong Momo right here

12:09.042 --> 12:09.834
Dad

12:09.834 --> 12:12.084
Don't you see that mouth of hers

12:12.084 --> 12:14.001
No wonder she's been a widow for all this time

12:14.001 --> 12:15.459
Stop eating those

12:16.792 --> 12:18.792
Say what you want, she did find a husband

12:18.917 --> 12:19.792
What about you?

12:20.751 --> 12:23.084
I'm afraid of having a mother-in-law like her

12:24.084 --> 12:25.167
Stop with that

12:25.167 --> 12:28.084
Don't bother with that dating show,
"if You Are The One"

12:28.501 --> 12:31.167
Even if you don't find it embarrassing, I do

12:31.459 --> 12:32.417
Mengjun

12:32.417 --> 12:34.167
Dad, allergy medicine

12:34.959 --> 12:37.376
Dad, allergy medicine!

12:46.167 --> 12:47.292
Careful, it's hot

12:54.167 --> 12:56.042
How many times have I told you

12:56.042 --> 12:58.751
This type of fish needs to be fried
on both sides first...

12:58.834 --> 13:00.917
...that way it won't taste so fishy...

13:00.917 --> 13:02.334
...and it will hold together in one piece

13:02.459 --> 13:05.042
The soup will be clear yet full of flavor

13:05.042 --> 13:06.334
Just look at this fish soup

13:06.334 --> 13:08.834
Mom, Guobin said he prefers a lighter soup

13:08.834 --> 13:10.834
Light doesn't need to taste bad

13:11.667 --> 13:12.959
Stop making excuses

13:12.959 --> 13:15.209
Stop, let me handle this

13:17.042 --> 13:19.251
If you paid the slightest attention
to what you eat,

13:19.251 --> 13:21.501
you wouldn't be in such poor shape

13:21.626 --> 13:22.501
Just look at yourself,

13:22.501 --> 13:24.167
you're weaker than me!

13:24.334 --> 13:27.167
What heart issues, you're just malnourished

13:27.167 --> 13:29.376
Mom, can you tell Dad...

13:29.376 --> 13:31.542
...to stop calling on me in class

13:31.542 --> 13:32.751
It's really em harassing

13:33.959 --> 13:35.667
How's that embarrassing?

13:35.667 --> 13:37.292
The way you dress is what's embarrassing

13:37.292 --> 13:37.959
Mom, I'm heading out first,

13:37.959 --> 13:39.251
I have a rehearsal this morning

13:39.251 --> 13:40.084
Come back here,

13:40.917 --> 13:42.084
it's your turn to wash the dishes

13:42.084 --> 13:43.459
Mom, I'm going to be late

13:43.834 --> 13:46.126
We had an agreement, it's your turn today

13:46.167 --> 13:46.917
Don't run off

13:46.917 --> 13:48.709
Xiang Xinran, this is none of your business

13:49.417 --> 13:51.001
I'm your older sister, show some respect

13:51.001 --> 13:52.959
Whatever you're only older by five minutes

13:52.959 --> 13:53.959
You come back here

14:07.751 --> 14:09.667
Let Grandma help with the dishes

14:09.917 --> 14:11.542
It's OK, Grandma. Let me do it.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.709
- You shouldn't miss rehearsal,
-Mom,

14:12.709 --> 14:14.001
I'll take care of it

14:14.001 --> 14:16.209
- I can do it, Grandma
-how can you be washing dishes?

14:16.209 --> 14:17.251
Let me do it

14:18.167 --> 14:19.167
OK fine

14:19.709 --> 14:21.417
Anybody can wash dishes

14:21.417 --> 14:23.584
Music though, that's a different story

14:24.792 --> 14:26.084
Thank you, Grandma

14:33.876 --> 14:35.792
Mom, I'm taking some money for dinner tonight

14:36.626 --> 14:38.376
Didn't I give you money just two days ago?

14:38.459 --> 14:39.501
Put the money back

14:56.501 --> 14:57.792
Qianjin, out of money?

14:57.792 --> 14:59.626
Grandma can help, is one hundred enough?

14:59.626 --> 15:01.751
Mom, how can he take your money?

15:01.751 --> 15:02.792
I have some here

15:03.167 --> 15:06.792
- Take it
-Mom, he shouldn't take yours

15:07.542 --> 15:09.209
In my opinion, you should take it all

15:09.209 --> 15:10.126
Really?

15:10.417 --> 15:13.084
Treat the other band members to dinner tonight

15:20.209 --> 15:21.209
I'm leaving

15:22.167 --> 15:23.209
Grandma

15:23.459 --> 15:25.251
Do you have to be so biased?

15:27.501 --> 15:29.501
Qianjin here started a band

15:29.501 --> 15:32.251
Once he's famous, he'll be featured
on entertainment news

15:33.001 --> 15:34.001
Just look at what you're wearing

15:34.001 --> 15:36.167
is this a shirt or bra?

15:36.376 --> 15:37.959
You're courting sexual harassment,

15:37.959 --> 15:39.251
that's how you'll make the news

15:39.251 --> 15:40.126
Mom

15:40.126 --> 15:42.459
You should leave the kids be

15:42.542 --> 15:44.292
How can I not worry about them?

15:44.459 --> 15:45.959
You, of all people

15:45.959 --> 15:47.209
Not intervening when you should...

15:47.209 --> 15:49.126
...and meddling when you shouldn't

15:49.876 --> 15:52.917
I'll say while you're more educated than me

15:52.917 --> 15:55.209
I did raise a university professor

15:55.292 --> 15:56.376
What about you?

15:56.501 --> 15:59.126
Aiyo, eat eat eat, that's all you're good at

15:59.126 --> 16:01.167
You dress like this and still eat that much

16:01.167 --> 16:03.251
Who exactly did you inherit this from?

16:03.917 --> 16:06.542
Don't go, I'm not finished

16:09.751 --> 16:11.334
You used to be in such good shape,

16:11.334 --> 16:13.834
now you've let yourself waste away like this

16:14.376 --> 16:16.709
You can't even take care of yourself,

16:17.042 --> 16:19.417
and you think you can take care
of the whole family?

16:22.959 --> 16:24.001
Honey, are you OK?

16:27.501 --> 16:29.126
Why don't you get checked up at the hospital

16:29.584 --> 16:30.584
That's not necessary

16:33.001 --> 16:34.834
I'll tell Mom to tone it down

16:35.209 --> 16:36.209
Alright

16:37.959 --> 16:40.084
Just let her say what she wants

16:40.376 --> 16:41.376
Don't mind her

16:58.459 --> 16:59.459
Sing

17:01.459 --> 17:04.334
"To love somebody is so hard"

17:04.626 --> 17:09.001
"Why can't I do anything right?"

17:10.126 --> 17:11.584
"Love"

17:12.626 --> 17:16.166
"is my subway train"

17:19.041 --> 17:20.459
"charging ahead"

17:20.459 --> 17:22.541
"free of obstacles"

17:49.542 --> 17:50.751
Xiaomei, Water

17:51.084 --> 17:53.417
Xiaomei, Who's the father?

17:53.501 --> 17:54.751
Come on,

17:55.042 --> 17:56.667
hard alcohol and Sprite

18:01.626 --> 18:02.584
Let's continue!

18:17.459 --> 18:18.376
Xiaomei

18:19.292 --> 18:20.917
You knew we had rehearsal today

18:21.334 --> 18:22.792
Why did you have to drink so much

18:23.334 --> 18:25.084
You're so out of tune right now,

18:25.126 --> 18:27.292
-my grandma could sing better than you
-Qianjin

18:27.834 --> 18:29.626
Well then let her sing!

18:29.626 --> 18:31.584
You wrote this stupid song

18:31.959 --> 18:33.251
This "love moving forward" crap

18:33.251 --> 18:34.626
Guess what? My life is moving backwards

18:34.834 --> 18:35.876
Boss

18:45.542 --> 18:46.376
You say that one more time

18:46.376 --> 18:47.959
Qianjin

18:48.126 --> 18:49.959
So what if I say it again?

18:51.751 --> 18:53.042
Let me remind you,

18:53.167 --> 18:55.334
it was you who begged me to sing
in the first place

18:55.334 --> 18:57.126
Well, can I admit what a mistake that was?

18:57.667 --> 18:59.584
Fine. Of course you can

19:00.501 --> 19:01.417
What

19:02.667 --> 19:05.334
You do realize that her family
owns this rooftop?

19:19.001 --> 19:19.959
Boss

19:21.459 --> 19:23.751
ls there really nobody you like so far?

19:23.751 --> 19:24.876
What do you think?

19:25.001 --> 19:26.834
I thought the last one wasn't bad

19:26.834 --> 19:28.626
Not bad for putting me to sleep

19:29.792 --> 19:32.001
Can you give me an example
of somebody you like?

19:33.709 --> 19:34.584
Sure

19:34.751 --> 19:35.751
Really?

19:37.959 --> 19:39.459
But they're all either old or dead

19:42.292 --> 19:43.626
Where can I find somebody like that...

19:43.834 --> 19:46.792
Xiaomei, we were wrong

19:47.334 --> 19:49.959
I promise this won't ever happen again

19:49.959 --> 19:51.501
Can you forgive us just this once?

19:52.209 --> 19:53.042
Go away!

19:53.042 --> 19:54.542
My drums are still in there

19:54.584 --> 19:55.626
Xiaomei

19:55.626 --> 19:56.292
I really

19:59.292 --> 20:01.876
My drum!

20:37.376 --> 20:40.542
This person never cleans up

20:56.376 --> 20:57.376
Yangqin

20:59.917 --> 21:01.042
Yangqin

21:05.126 --> 21:06.084
Yangqin

21:17.084 --> 21:18.042
Grandma

21:20.459 --> 21:22.167
Grandma, what's going on with Mom?

21:23.167 --> 21:24.376
How's Yangqin doing?

21:38.292 --> 21:39.334
Honey

21:39.876 --> 21:42.209
How are you feeling? A little better?

21:43.542 --> 21:44.542
Want some water?

21:45.584 --> 21:46.459
Mom

21:47.959 --> 21:48.834
Mom

21:49.209 --> 21:50.251
What happened to Mom?

21:50.292 --> 21:51.667
Move aside

21:52.417 --> 21:55.292
Guobin, she wants to speak with me

21:56.209 --> 21:57.251
I'm here,

21:57.584 --> 21:58.501
speak

21:59.209 --> 21:59.917
Mom

22:03.209 --> 22:04.709
She'd like you to wait outside

22:07.417 --> 22:08.084
Oh

22:17.917 --> 22:18.876
ls everything OK?

22:18.876 --> 22:21.001
No need to worry, she has no major issues,

22:21.542 --> 22:23.459
but she should get a monthly checkup

22:23.459 --> 22:24.376
Please do not forget

22:25.126 --> 22:27.626
She needs to be on a healthy diet and rest well

22:29.001 --> 22:29.709
One more thing

22:30.334 --> 22:32.126
Don't give her any kind of stress

22:32.417 --> 22:34.084
She must not be agitated in any way

22:36.042 --> 22:36.667
OK

22:40.167 --> 22:42.084
You don't care about Mom at all

22:42.209 --> 22:44.417
It's all Grandma's fault
that she was in the hospital

22:44.501 --> 22:45.542
No way

22:45.542 --> 22:46.709
Dad, you can't

22:46.709 --> 22:48.417
You can't put her in that kind of place

22:49.417 --> 22:50.792
What kind of place?

22:52.084 --> 22:53.376
Isn't it just a nursing home?

22:53.376 --> 22:54.584
What's the big deal?

22:54.584 --> 22:56.292
Nursing homes these days are great,

22:56.292 --> 22:57.584
and the food is excellent

22:57.584 --> 22:59.709
Tons of people are living nice
and comfortably there

22:59.709 --> 23:00.542
Right Dad?

23:00.542 --> 23:01.917
If it's so comfortable,
why don't you go live there?

23:02.126 --> 23:02.792
Dad

23:02.792 --> 23:04.376
Just think, one day she'll send you
to a nursing home too

23:05.042 --> 23:06.667
Xiang Xinran, I'm warning you

23:06.667 --> 23:07.751
So what?

23:07.751 --> 23:08.917
OK

23:14.584 --> 23:15.334
Mom

23:16.459 --> 23:17.542
You're here?

23:19.917 --> 23:21.417
Princess Huanzhu is starting soon

23:22.084 --> 23:23.209
Let me find it

23:25.834 --> 23:26.709
Grandma, Grandma, um...

23:26.709 --> 23:27.626
Qianjin

23:37.167 --> 23:39.334
I think I should go live the comfortable life

23:45.084 --> 23:46.751
I've made my decision

23:56.584 --> 23:58.667
It's less than an hour away

24:01.667 --> 24:03.501
You can come visit me

24:17.709 --> 24:18.584
Here

24:20.501 --> 24:22.126
Mom, stop peeling

24:22.542 --> 24:24.042
Here, have some meat,

24:24.292 --> 24:25.334
it's very tender

24:26.459 --> 24:27.792
I'm full,

24:28.167 --> 24:29.334
eat the shrimp

24:31.417 --> 24:33.084
Here , you eat too

24:33.751 --> 24:34.667
Here , you eat too

24:35.667 --> 24:36.834
Eat the shrimp

24:46.334 --> 24:47.167
Mom

24:50.001 --> 24:51.792
Once she gets better

24:54.209 --> 24:55.751
I'll come pick you up

24:58.084 --> 24:59.417
Be good to her

25:00.126 --> 25:00.959
OK

25:03.584 --> 25:05.584
Don't blame it on me next time

25:14.834 --> 25:15.626
Mom, get in the car

25:15.626 --> 25:16.709
Let's go Grandma

25:17.292 --> 25:18.459
You all go home first

25:18.792 --> 25:20.667
I want to take a walk to visit Uncle Li

25:23.501 --> 25:24.417
Let me drive you there

25:24.626 --> 25:26.751
It's only one stop away, I can walk

25:26.792 --> 25:28.001
I should still give you a ride

25:28.626 --> 25:30.001
Don't you have work tomorrow?

25:30.251 --> 25:31.376
Just go back home

25:32.042 --> 25:33.001
Alright, I'll leave then

26:20.251 --> 26:21.251
Hello Grandma

26:21.584 --> 26:24.459
Ah, my dear grandson,
why didn't you come to dinner?

26:24.584 --> 26:25.959
I'm not in the mood to see Dad and my sister

26:26.626 --> 26:28.459
Don't say that

26:28.501 --> 26:31.709
Once Grandma is gone,
you should listen to your dad...

26:31.751 --> 26:33.417
...and stop fighting with your sister

26:34.001 --> 26:35.417
So, you haven't eaten yet?

26:35.626 --> 26:37.001
Not yet

26:37.001 --> 26:38.417
Grandma's treating you tonight

26:38.751 --> 26:40.126
What do you want to eat?

26:40.167 --> 26:41.251
What do I want to eat?

26:41.251 --> 26:43.834
Braised chicken with chestnuts! Hotpot!

26:44.167 --> 26:44.959
OK

26:44.959 --> 26:46.542
Can my two friends tag along?

26:46.542 --> 26:47.751
Of course they can

26:47.751 --> 26:49.876
My grandson's friends are my friends

26:49.876 --> 26:51.626
let's meet at Shiban Street in a bit?

26:51.876 --> 26:52.751
Sure

27:31.042 --> 27:35.001
"Photography Studio of Youth"

28:19.542 --> 28:23.584
Wow, I didn't realize this store was so huge

28:34.709 --> 28:36.626
Welcome to the Photography Studio of Youth

28:42.042 --> 28:43.251
How strange

28:43.876 --> 28:45.292
I walk by this area everyday...

28:45.292 --> 28:47.292
...and have never seen this photography studio

28:51.167 --> 28:53.542
I've never had pictures taken
at a studio before

28:55.751 --> 28:57.751
I want these to look especially nice

28:59.376 --> 29:02.001
Later on, they can be used for my funeral

29:02.751 --> 29:04.834
Leave the family something to remember me by

29:07.084 --> 29:08.501
When I was younger,

29:11.251 --> 29:12.792
I loved Teresa Teng

29:14.167 --> 29:16.126
Can you make me look like her?

29:21.292 --> 29:23.459
Over here, look at the camera

29:24.959 --> 29:26.167
Smile

29:37.834 --> 29:39.792
Picture yourself at the peak of your beauty

29:44.167 --> 29:45.542
The peak of my beauty...

29:52.584 --> 29:54.042
The peak of my beauty...

29:57.167 --> 29:58.834
I let those years just slip by

30:12.084 --> 30:12.876
Hello

30:13.292 --> 30:14.251
Qianjin

30:14.251 --> 30:15.084
Hi Grandma

30:15.709 --> 30:17.001
Grandma will be right over

30:17.001 --> 30:18.667
- I'm here
-You're there?

30:19.667 --> 30:21.001
I'm coming

30:26.126 --> 30:27.167
What's going on?

30:27.376 --> 30:28.626
I'm so hungry

30:28.792 --> 30:31.626
Not sure, she sounds a bit strange
over the phone

30:31.709 --> 30:32.834
Strange?

30:46.542 --> 30:47.501
Wait stop

30:47.626 --> 30:48.626
Stop the bus

30:49.167 --> 30:50.084
Stop the bus

30:57.417 --> 30:58.751
Senior Citizen's Card

31:00.917 --> 31:02.459
Watch it! What are you doing

31:02.667 --> 31:04.042
I'm sorry, young man

31:11.751 --> 31:12.626
Hey

31:14.209 --> 31:15.917
You bumped into me earlier

31:17.542 --> 31:18.584
and

31:19.167 --> 31:21.459
-it really hurt
-Yeah, a lot of pain

31:22.751 --> 31:24.209
Are you trying to extort me?

31:24.959 --> 31:26.209
I wouldn't dare!

31:27.626 --> 31:28.834
How about this

31:29.501 --> 31:30.709
You give me a kiss

31:30.917 --> 31:32.751
Just a kiss, and I'll let it slide

31:34.167 --> 31:35.459
Just a kiss

31:36.542 --> 31:37.501
OK then

31:37.792 --> 31:38.834
Come over

31:40.626 --> 31:42.001
Go

31:42.751 --> 31:44.834
Closer, even closer

31:48.417 --> 31:50.126
You little bastard

31:50.126 --> 31:52.167
Speaking like that to an old lady,
get out of my way

31:52.501 --> 31:54.209
Pulling that kind of stunt on an old lady!

31:54.209 --> 31:55.709
Would you dare do that to your grandmother?

31:55.709 --> 31:58.084
Did you even stop and consider my age?

32:02.167 --> 32:03.209
Twenty

32:04.584 --> 32:05.667
Nineteen

32:06.042 --> 32:07.292
Eighteen

32:08.501 --> 32:09.709
Eighteen

32:13.459 --> 32:14.834
Eighteen

32:15.126 --> 32:17.084
Seventeen

32:30.084 --> 32:31.167
Cellphone's off

32:31.626 --> 32:34.751
Maybe the battery's run out, let's just go eat

32:34.751 --> 32:36.709
Yeah, maybe she'll join us soon anyway

32:39.751 --> 32:43.042
"Licensed Sex Shop"

32:50.209 --> 32:52.292
Wasn't this a photography studio just now?

32:52.876 --> 32:55.126
What photography studio? Can't you read?

32:59.334 --> 33:00.751
How is that possible?

33:04.626 --> 33:06.417
Miss, this one here

33:06.417 --> 33:08.501
If you're interested, come in and try it on

33:09.459 --> 33:10.667
They're all quite nice

33:11.501 --> 33:12.834
What is the matter with you?

33:13.334 --> 33:15.459
Have you no decency an old lady like me?

33:16.667 --> 33:18.876
I call Grandma's room

33:19.542 --> 33:20.792
No way, I called it already

33:21.084 --> 33:22.209
It should be mine

33:22.209 --> 33:23.334
-it's mine
-Get out

33:23.334 --> 33:24.792
You two stop fighting

33:24.876 --> 33:26.917
Let's move her things out first

33:27.209 --> 33:29.417
At last, I'm free of her!

33:29.417 --> 33:31.167
- Mine!
-This bookshelf is mine too

33:31.167 --> 33:32.334
Everybody stop

33:33.251 --> 33:35.042
Just look at yourselves

33:37.292 --> 33:39.417
I've made up my mind about this room long ago

33:40.501 --> 33:41.709
It will be a new study room

33:42.709 --> 33:44.459
Dad, that's a wonderful idea

34:23.542 --> 34:25.167
Have you tried calling her?

34:25.167 --> 34:27.042
I did, her cell phone is not on

34:28.583 --> 34:30.458
I knew she must be upset with me...

34:30.708 --> 34:32.292
...and I was afraid to disturb you so late
at night

34:32.626 --> 34:34.876
So that's why I rushed over so early
this morning

34:35.292 --> 34:36.126
Uncle Li

34:36.542 --> 34:38.083
Could you ask her to come down

34:38.333 --> 34:39.917
I want to apologize to her

34:40.251 --> 34:41.251
Really

34:41.292 --> 34:42.667
Mom, can I at least apologize to you?

34:42.667 --> 34:44.501
Your mother really isn't here

34:44.501 --> 34:46.958
You must have said some terrible things to her,

34:46.958 --> 34:48.001
you brat

34:48.333 --> 34:50.126
What could I have said to upset her?

34:50.126 --> 34:51.251
Let's hurry and call the police

34:51.626 --> 34:52.708
Call the police?

34:52.792 --> 34:53.751
Call the police

34:54.001 --> 34:55.376
She's really not here with you?

34:55.376 --> 34:56.501
Really

34:56.501 --> 34:57.876
Well, if she's only been missing this long

34:57.876 --> 34:59.209
The police won't even take the case yet

34:59.376 --> 35:02.542
Is it possible she had a fall somewhere?

35:03.126 --> 35:05.626
Given Auntie Shen's good physical
and mental health,

35:05.626 --> 35:06.584
a fall seems very unlikely

35:06.584 --> 35:08.459
What about a car accident?

35:08.542 --> 35:09.959
Or what if she was kidnapped?

35:09.959 --> 35:11.751
There's no need for wild speculation

35:11.792 --> 35:12.834
Guobin

35:13.042 --> 35:14.626
If she really has been kidnapped,

35:14.709 --> 35:17.334
I am willing to sell this house
and pay the ransom to save her

35:18.001 --> 35:19.959
Come on, if you do sell...

35:20.334 --> 35:22.292
...then what will happen to me?

35:22.292 --> 35:23.709
Are you planning on...

35:23.709 --> 35:24.959
...having your own daughter live on the street?

35:24.959 --> 35:26.292
Stop with your nonsense

35:26.292 --> 35:27.917
What nonsense

35:27.917 --> 35:30.001
Tell me, who's more important, her or me?

35:30.001 --> 35:31.709
Of course she is

35:31.792 --> 35:33.626
- She's gone missing!
-Well, can she provide

35:33.626 --> 35:34.834
-end-of-life care for you?
-That's what you are for

35:34.834 --> 35:36.667
It's me, me, me

35:36.667 --> 35:39.209
Cut it out, go find a husband already

37:45.167 --> 37:46.542
Let's throw these out

37:47.709 --> 37:48.834
Why do that?

37:49.292 --> 37:50.376
Put them in a bag please

38:19.667 --> 38:21.084
So you'd like to rent?

38:21.084 --> 38:21.834
Yes

38:22.209 --> 38:23.876
How did you know we have availability?

38:24.751 --> 38:26.751
Didn't there used to be a posting right here?

38:27.042 --> 38:27.959
We removed that ages ago

38:27.959 --> 38:30.209
That's the one I'm referring to

38:31.834 --> 38:33.792
1,500 per month, 1 month deposit,
3 months upfront

38:33.792 --> 38:35.584
Food, water, and electricity not included

38:35.917 --> 38:36.876
Don't rip me off

38:37.334 --> 38:39.209
Even with the heat on in winter,
it's only 1,200

38:41.751 --> 38:42.917
I'll take the small room

38:42.917 --> 38:45.167
Let's call it 1,000,
and don't worry about my food

38:45.376 --> 38:46.584
ls your mother's cabinet still around?

38:46.584 --> 38:47.542
Bring it over to my room

38:48.251 --> 38:49.084
One second

38:49.459 --> 38:52.042
Have you been here before? Have we met?

38:53.501 --> 38:55.251
I used to live nearby

38:55.251 --> 38:57.126
I'm sure we've seen each other before

38:59.709 --> 39:00.876
Dad, you're back

39:01.792 --> 39:03.834
This young lady would like to rent here

39:04.667 --> 39:06.251
Oh right, what's your name?

39:06.251 --> 39:07.292
My name is Meng

39:07.667 --> 39:08.417
Lijun

39:08.417 --> 39:09.334
Meng Lijun

39:09.792 --> 39:10.792
Lijun

39:12.667 --> 39:14.001
So what if her name is Lijun?

39:16.167 --> 39:18.751
Teresa Teng was Auntie Shen's favorite

39:19.501 --> 39:22.001
Don't worry, I'm sure Auntie Shen is fine

39:22.542 --> 39:24.584
One day, she's perfectly fine,

39:24.584 --> 39:25.792
I'll leave you two to chat, I'm going upstairs

39:26.084 --> 39:27.834
and the next day, she disappears just like that

39:27.834 --> 39:29.542
You have to pay the rent first

39:47.251 --> 39:48.209
You're back

39:54.084 --> 39:56.334
Let me handle it, take it easy

40:09.917 --> 40:10.917
"Yangqin,

40:10.917 --> 40:12.376
remember to take your medicine"

40:12.376 --> 40:14.792
I'm fine, take care of yourselves

40:16.876 --> 40:19.001
I should be the one running away from home

40:27.542 --> 40:31.209
"Dongqing Community Senior Activity Center"

Red Dragon

40:37.709 --> 40:39.917
Brother Li, take a tile

40:45.251 --> 40:47.042
Hurry and discard a tile

40:51.501 --> 40:53.459
What are you doing?

40:53.959 --> 40:57.001
You tell me, someone her age as fragile as her

40:57.001 --> 40:58.501
Where could she go?

40:58.626 --> 41:01.376
That's enough Brother Li,
you know her better than anybody

41:01.459 --> 41:04.626
I bet she'll outlive every one of us here

41:04.792 --> 41:05.751
One Character

41:06.292 --> 41:08.251
We should just focus on...

41:08.292 --> 41:09.792
...taking good care of ourselves

41:09.834 --> 41:11.501
That is what's important

41:11.709 --> 41:12.792
Would you grab a tile already?

41:12.959 --> 41:14.501
"Mengjun's grandson"

41:18.084 --> 41:19.167
Why?

41:19.209 --> 41:21.042
Old Li, how can you just stop like that

41:21.334 --> 41:22.292
I'll take over

41:22.501 --> 41:23.834
I'll take his place

41:26.334 --> 41:27.917
- Who are you?
-Do you hear anything from your grandma?

41:27.917 --> 41:28.834
I

41:29.917 --> 41:33.376
I'm Grandpa Li's tenant, tenant...

41:33.417 --> 41:35.376
So you're Old Li's tenant...

41:35.626 --> 41:36.876
I know

41:38.667 --> 41:40.042
Are you familiar with the rules here?

41:40.667 --> 41:42.209
Qing-Hun-Pong rules: no bonus tiles,
no mixing suits,

41:42.251 --> 41:43.292
and no Pongs before opening

41:43.584 --> 41:45.167
Big sister, hurry and shuffle

41:45.709 --> 41:47.042
I'm familiar

Granny

41:49.459 --> 41:50.501
What did you call me?

41:51.209 --> 41:53.459
You call her big sister and me granny?

41:53.876 --> 41:55.042
Do I look like a granny to you?

You deserve to lose

Hand over the money

43:15.376 --> 43:17.459
Boss, you said you didn't like the last group

43:17.459 --> 43:18.667
Tell me what you're looking for,

43:18.667 --> 43:19.667
I can narrow my search

I'll be waiting

Young lady

43:30.626 --> 43:32.459
Did I do something to offend you?

43:32.501 --> 43:34.042
Every move I make, you either call Pong

43:34.376 --> 43:35.584
or Kong

43:37.667 --> 43:39.251
- I'm done
-Please don't

43:40.417 --> 43:41.001
Hand over the money

43:41.001 --> 43:43.042
Old Lu, can't you see

43:43.417 --> 43:45.584
if we keep playing with her,
we'll all go bankrupt

43:47.751 --> 43:50.001
I'll sing Sweetness

43:50.751 --> 43:53.167
Big sister, let me sing this one

43:53.292 --> 43:54.292
I beg of you

Young man

43:56.959 --> 43:57.792
I'd like to sing

43:57.792 --> 43:58.667
Which song?

44:01.876 --> 44:04.584
Boss, the last person really wasn't bad

44:04.959 --> 44:06.126
You don't think so?

44:06.167 --> 44:07.626
Young talent needs to be developed

44:07.626 --> 44:09.084
You need to give them a chance

44:09.084 --> 44:10.834
Nobody's born a good musician

44:10.834 --> 44:13.251
Grandpa Li, I was just at the police station

44:13.584 --> 44:15.251
They said that Grandma left home
on her own terms

44:15.501 --> 44:17.042
- There's no case
-Left home on her own terms?

44:17.042 --> 44:20.167

44:41.959 --> 44:45.542
"makeup cannot conceal"

44:46.084 --> 44:49.834
"My broken heart"

44:50.292 --> 44:54.334
"drained of so much love"

44:54.709 --> 44:56.751
"Lies about making up for it"

44:56.751 --> 44:59.084
"justified as atonement"

44:59.084 --> 45:02.334
"I won't be fooled"

45:03.376 --> 45:07.626
"Love is a journey of the heart"

45:07.709 --> 45:11.792
"Only room for us two"

45:12.084 --> 45:16.292
"I can't wander alone"

45:16.292 --> 45:20.292
"nor can there be three people"

45:20.459 --> 45:24.501
"You can find new romance"

45:24.584 --> 45:28.917
"and leave without a trace"

45:29.001 --> 45:33.209
"But please don't use atonement as an excuse"

45:33.584 --> 45:37.876
"to hurt me again"

45:38.376 --> 45:40.584
Get off the stage, Stop it!

45:55.334 --> 45:59.417
"Eyes addicted to crying"

45:59.417 --> 46:03.251
"stained red by tears"

46:03.876 --> 46:07.667
"How much time will I need"

46:08.209 --> 46:11.917
"to forget this love?"

46:12.542 --> 46:16.626
"My fragile heart"

46:16.917 --> 46:21.042
"still carries your scars"

46:21.167 --> 46:23.334
"Lies about making up for it"

46:23.334 --> 46:25.584
"justified as atonement"

46:25.584 --> 46:29.251
"How can I believe that?"

46:29.917 --> 46:33.959
"Love is a journey of the heart"

46:34.209 --> 46:38.417
"Only room for us two"

46:38.542 --> 46:42.459
"I can't wander alone"

46:42.876 --> 46:46.667
"nor can there be three people"

46:47.001 --> 46:51.251
"You can find new romance"

46:51.251 --> 46:55.376
"and leave without a trace"

46:55.584 --> 46:59.626
"But please don't use atonement as an excuse"

47:00.209 --> 47:04.167
"to hurt me again"

47:16.501 --> 47:17.542
You know who she is?

47:17.542 --> 47:18.667
Who is she, Grandpa Li?

47:18.792 --> 47:20.417
Our tenant

47:21.251 --> 47:22.376
Lijun, where are you going?

47:22.376 --> 47:24.376
Good day Miss, I'm the...

47:25.292 --> 47:26.209
Miss!

47:27.292 --> 47:28.459
- Boss
-Miss!

47:28.459 --> 47:30.126
- Come back inside, it's raining.
-Wait.

47:33.542 --> 47:35.501
The real princess is Ziwei

47:35.501 --> 47:37.626
She is indeed the daughter of Yu Hexia

47:51.126 --> 47:52.376
This part

47:52.417 --> 47:55.209
The emperor still hasn't figured out Ziwei
is his daughter

47:55.917 --> 47:57.084
He hasn't

47:58.959 --> 48:01.376
Say, don't you think the emperor is so stupid?

48:01.876 --> 48:03.417
She's even played by the same person

48:03.667 --> 48:05.209
and he can't tell

48:09.876 --> 48:12.251
This is not the channel we were on last time

48:12.751 --> 48:14.167
Quick, change it

48:14.251 --> 48:15.667
Let's continue from where we left off

48:15.959 --> 48:18.084
Grandpa Li, that girl from today,
does she live here?

48:21.417 --> 48:24.292
Do you remember Xia Yuhe at Darning lake?

48:24.709 --> 48:25.834
What is it?

48:26.084 --> 48:28.167
Nothing, I was just looking for her

48:28.751 --> 48:29.917
What for?

48:32.209 --> 48:33.334
The uh

48:36.042 --> 48:37.417
Why are you sitting down

48:40.959 --> 48:41.876
I...

48:41.917 --> 48:43.709
This kind of sound

48:43.751 --> 48:45.251
This kind of person

48:45.751 --> 48:49.626
I seem to have a faint memory of this

48:50.459 --> 48:51.542
Everything here

48:51.542 --> 48:52.751
feels so familiar

48:53.376 --> 48:54.792
so intimate

48:54.834 --> 48:56.709
You are blood relatives

48:56.751 --> 48:58.709
How can you take an interest in her?

48:59.584 --> 49:00.876
Who says he takes an interest in me?

49:03.251 --> 49:05.542
I was saying the emperor,

49:05.834 --> 49:08.084
Ziwei is not his daughter

49:19.417 --> 49:20.501
Let's talk

49:24.667 --> 49:26.917
It's Lijun right?

49:28.417 --> 49:29.167
Yup

49:30.584 --> 49:31.626
Been a while...

49:32.251 --> 49:34.167
...since you've had a drink with a boy?

49:35.459 --> 49:36.209
Umm

49:37.334 --> 49:38.084
Yes

49:39.959 --> 49:42.126
Why do you always keep your head down?

49:42.209 --> 49:43.584
Am I that scary?

49:51.792 --> 49:52.626
Actually

49:53.001 --> 49:54.501
The moment I met you

49:56.084 --> 49:57.251
You gave me a special kind of feeling

49:59.917 --> 50:01.584
What kind of special feeling?

50:05.709 --> 50:07.917
I...I have a request, but

50:07.959 --> 50:09.251
I'm afraid...

50:09.334 --> 50:10.542
...you'll reject it if I say

50:10.917 --> 50:11.876
So don't say it then

50:12.042 --> 50:13.751
No way, I must ask

50:14.167 --> 50:14.917
Could we...

50:14.917 --> 50:16.126
Didn't I just tell you not to?

50:16.292 --> 50:17.667
No, that's not what I meant

50:17.751 --> 50:18.834
What I mean is, do you think we could...

50:18.834 --> 50:19.876
No

50:20.209 --> 50:21.417
How could we possibly become a couple?

50:21.417 --> 50:22.876
We can't possibly become a couple

50:22.876 --> 50:24.542
We should never become a couple

50:30.834 --> 50:32.084
I meant singing

50:32.417 --> 50:33.126
What?

50:33.751 --> 50:34.917
I have a band

50:35.709 --> 50:37.042
Our lead singer quit

50:39.959 --> 50:41.167
Mind your own business

50:44.667 --> 50:46.792
Singing, being in a band

50:46.834 --> 50:48.501
My family would never support me

50:58.334 --> 50:59.834
My family doesn't support me either

51:01.167 --> 51:02.667
Only my grandma does...

51:07.334 --> 51:08.917
...but she fled home recently

51:08.959 --> 51:10.209
No idea where she is now

51:26.334 --> 51:27.751
I'm such a failure, right?

51:31.417 --> 51:32.251
Alright

51:40.459 --> 51:41.792
It's just singing after all

51:42.667 --> 51:43.751
I'll sing

51:44.709 --> 51:45.376
I'll sing

51:46.042 --> 51:47.376
Come

51:47.876 --> 51:48.792
Eat the shrimp

51:49.126 --> 51:50.126
Hurry up

51:51.959 --> 51:54.626
"Your love"

51:54.751 --> 51:58.417
"is my subway train"

52:00.792 --> 52:04.417
"charging ahead, free of obstacles"

52:07.667 --> 52:11.292
"Just who exactly is your"

52:11.417 --> 52:14.501
"destination?"

52:23.292 --> 52:24.167
What's the matter?

52:27.209 --> 52:28.792
You people,

52:30.251 --> 52:32.542
dragging a girl to this god forsaken place

52:32.584 --> 52:33.709
Howling and wailing around

52:34.251 --> 52:35.417
Do your parents know about this?

52:35.959 --> 52:37.292
This is rock and roll

52:37.334 --> 52:38.792
Roll? Where are you rolling to?

52:41.251 --> 52:42.251
And you

52:43.501 --> 52:45.001
"Oh" this, "Oh" that

52:47.584 --> 52:49.084
How strange

52:50.709 --> 52:51.834
There's so much equipment

52:52.209 --> 52:53.751
How did you move it all here?

52:59.334 --> 53:01.334
I don't understand your style of music

53:01.876 --> 53:03.001
I can't help you

53:03.459 --> 53:04.251
I'm leaving

53:06.126 --> 53:06.959
Wait wait

53:08.251 --> 53:08.959
So

53:09.876 --> 53:11.542
What kind of music do you want to sing?

53:11.542 --> 53:13.042
We'll do it your way

53:13.209 --> 53:14.084
Yeah

53:23.334 --> 53:25.751
I can think of one song

53:26.917 --> 53:28.542
It has a beautiful melody

53:29.709 --> 53:31.126
and an upbeat rhythm

53:32.126 --> 53:33.126
Sing it

53:33.167 --> 53:34.459
Yeah, sing it

53:34.709 --> 53:35.709
Sing it

53:38.209 --> 53:39.167
Alright

53:43.501 --> 53:46.626
"Give me a kiss"

53:47.667 --> 53:50.084
"Yes or no?"

53:51.667 --> 53:54.876
"Even an air kiss is fine"

53:54.876 --> 53:57.417
"I will be just as grateful"

54:04.876 --> 54:07.251
"Give me a kiss"

54:07.626 --> 54:09.667
"Yes or no?"

54:10.376 --> 54:13.167
"Kiss me on the cheek"

54:13.167 --> 54:15.292
"Leave a mark of love"

54:15.917 --> 54:18.334
"Give me a kiss"

54:18.667 --> 54:20.751
"Yes or no?"

54:21.417 --> 54:24.042
"Kiss me on the heart"

54:24.167 --> 54:25.917
"Let me long for you"

54:25.917 --> 54:28.584
"even while staring into your eyes"

54:28.667 --> 54:30.667
"Even if you say no"

54:31.459 --> 54:34.042
"I still must ask"

54:34.126 --> 54:36.459
"I won't be discouraged"

54:36.959 --> 54:39.501
"even while staring at your lips"

54:39.709 --> 54:41.834
"Even if you don't respond"

54:42.501 --> 54:45.042
"I still must beg of you"

54:45.209 --> 54:47.292
"I won't be sad"

54:49.042 --> 54:51.376
"Give me a kiss"

54:51.792 --> 54:53.792
"Yes or no?"

54:54.501 --> 54:56.876
"Even an air kiss is fine"

54:56.876 --> 54:59.417
"I will be just as grateful"

55:00.042 --> 55:02.417
"Give me a kiss"

55:02.834 --> 55:04.792
"Even a superficial one is fine"

55:05.584 --> 55:07.959
"An air kiss symbolizes your sweetness"

55:07.959 --> 55:10.792
"I will be just as grateful"

55:11.084 --> 55:13.459
"An air kiss symbolizes your sweetness"

55:13.459 --> 55:15.959
"I will be just as grateful"

55:16.667 --> 55:19.001
"An air kiss symbolizes your sweetness"

55:19.001 --> 55:23.626
"I will be just as grateful"

55:27.667 --> 55:29.542
Cheers!

55:29.584 --> 55:31.501
We've never gotten this kind
of reception before

55:31.501 --> 55:33.084
We'll cruise through next week's auditions...

55:33.084 --> 55:34.209
...with Lijun

55:34.251 --> 55:36.876
That goes without saying, of course

55:37.417 --> 55:38.292
Waitress

55:38.751 --> 55:40.417
What's your most expensive dish?

55:40.751 --> 55:41.667
How does a whole fish sound?

55:41.667 --> 55:42.959
Let's have a whole fish, one whole fish

55:43.251 --> 55:45.167
No, thank you

55:45.584 --> 55:46.501
Thank you

55:47.709 --> 55:49.751
Don't you guys realize

55:49.959 --> 55:51.292
how expensive everything here is?

55:52.376 --> 55:54.042
Back when this place first opened,

55:54.042 --> 55:56.376
the portions were so generous...

55:56.376 --> 55:58.792
...and the food was delicious and cheap

55:58.876 --> 56:00.001
At that time,

56:00.001 --> 56:03.084
the number of customers lining up
were unbelievable

56:03.084 --> 56:04.501
Now look

56:06.876 --> 56:09.126
"Celebrating 50 years in business"

56:11.542 --> 56:12.834
Boys, here

56:12.959 --> 56:14.292
Another round of drinks

56:14.292 --> 56:15.584
Alright

56:15.667 --> 56:18.042
- Cheers
-Another! Young men

56:29.792 --> 56:31.126
How much for this?

56:31.501 --> 56:33.376
Two fifty? It was two last time

56:38.834 --> 56:39.876
How much for these?

56:40.501 --> 56:42.667
Four per half kilo

56:45.376 --> 56:46.417
And these?

56:47.126 --> 56:48.417
Three per half kilo

56:52.917 --> 56:54.751
- These?
-Also three

56:57.959 --> 56:59.042
Hey

56:59.917 --> 57:01.376
Don't start eating without buying

57:03.542 --> 57:05.542
How can I know what to buy without sampling?

57:06.042 --> 57:06.917
Crazy

57:07.584 --> 57:08.792
Could you weigh that for me?

57:12.751 --> 57:14.917
Don't cry

57:20.792 --> 57:22.667
Settle him down

57:24.042 --> 57:24.917
How much is it?

57:24.917 --> 57:25.792
Twenty Five

57:27.709 --> 57:28.667
Just a second, I'll get cash

57:28.667 --> 57:29.751
Let me hold him

57:30.376 --> 57:31.209
I can help

57:31.209 --> 57:32.334
Do you still want this?

57:32.334 --> 57:33.792
Thank you so much

57:35.417 --> 57:36.917
- Do you want this or not?
-Sorry about that

57:37.459 --> 57:38.251
How much is it?

57:38.334 --> 57:39.376
Twenty Five

57:39.376 --> 57:41.751
This baby is so cute

57:44.751 --> 57:46.501
Hungry? Did you bring milk?

57:46.792 --> 57:47.667
Yes

57:48.209 --> 57:50.001
Hurry

57:50.001 --> 57:51.209
I'll pay for it

57:55.501 --> 57:56.584
So well behaved

57:57.709 --> 57:59.542
How can you have him wear so little?

57:59.667 --> 58:01.292
Look, no socks even!

58:01.334 --> 58:03.334
See, wasn't I saying that earlier?

58:05.709 --> 58:07.084
Thanks, I'll take him back now

58:11.834 --> 58:12.751
He's crying again

58:17.876 --> 58:18.792
Is this...

58:18.834 --> 58:20.917
...breast milk or milk powder?

58:20.959 --> 58:23.292
Breast milk, although it does give him diarrhea

58:24.084 --> 58:25.251
No wonder

58:25.667 --> 58:27.376
It's too watery

58:29.709 --> 58:30.792
With denser milk,

58:30.792 --> 58:32.667
the baby will be chubby and fair-skinned

58:32.709 --> 58:34.459
He also wouldn't have diarrhea

58:34.709 --> 58:36.459
Just look at how skinny the mom is

58:37.167 --> 58:39.042
She must have had terrible post-natal care

58:39.084 --> 58:42.126
The wateriness must be caused by malnutrition

58:42.126 --> 58:43.292
Exactly

58:43.292 --> 58:44.459
The month after giving birth

58:44.542 --> 58:46.251
she didn't eat this, didn't eat that

58:46.251 --> 58:47.959
- How can her milk be good?
-Let's go, Mom

58:48.334 --> 58:50.334
No wonder he's always crying

58:51.501 --> 58:52.459
Baby

58:53.959 --> 58:55.667
Mommy's milk is watery...

58:55.709 --> 58:58.084
...gives you diarrhea and doesn't fill you up

58:59.167 --> 59:00.292
What is wrong with you?

59:00.709 --> 59:02.917
Somebody your age, going on and on about milk

59:03.209 --> 59:04.167
Your breast milk is so good huh?

59:04.251 --> 59:05.167
Only yours will do

59:05.167 --> 59:06.542
Why don't you nurse a kid yourself?

59:07.959 --> 59:08.959
Mom, let's go

59:16.209 --> 59:17.959
I nursed a college professor

59:18.876 --> 59:20.667
Of course my milk is good

59:26.251 --> 59:27.376
Hello Miss

59:29.709 --> 59:30.792
We've met before

59:33.376 --> 59:34.417
When?

59:36.209 --> 59:38.251
I've met you but perhaps you don't remember

59:41.709 --> 59:44.084
How about we find a place to sit and chat?

59:46.167 --> 59:47.459
What era are you from?

59:47.834 --> 59:49.376
Using that kind of pickup line

59:49.917 --> 59:51.251
Sit and chat...

59:51.542 --> 59:52.959
Why don't you just invite me directly
to a hotel room?

59:54.751 --> 59:56.251
Actually, I've noticed you for quite a while

59:57.917 --> 59:58.792
What do you want?

01:00:00.584 --> 01:00:01.334
I'm not a bad guy

01:00:01.334 --> 01:00:02.959
What kind of bad guy admits that he is?

01:00:03.292 --> 01:00:05.459
I'm warning you, stop following me

01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:10.709
Miss, I work at a record label...

01:00:19.501 --> 01:00:21.167
Help!

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:23.167
Pervert!

01:00:23.167 --> 01:00:25.084
It's a misunderstanding

01:00:25.084 --> 01:00:26.751
I had a bad feeling about you

01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:29.667
A pervert in broad daylight! Restrain him!

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:31.251
It's a misunderstanding

01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:32.751
I'm not

01:00:32.751 --> 01:00:34.459
I work at a record label

01:00:47.334 --> 01:00:49.584
I'll get it

01:00:53.709 --> 01:00:54.667
Slow down

01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:56.459
Who exactly is this important guest of yours?

01:01:07.584 --> 01:01:09.251
How did you know I love watermelon?

01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:10.584
Please come in

01:01:12.167 --> 01:01:13.251
Mom, my friend is here

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:21.417
Gee, you look fine to me

01:01:21.834 --> 01:01:22.876
Huh?

01:01:24.459 --> 01:01:25.667
I was saying

01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:27.126
Auntie

01:01:27.876 --> 01:01:28.959
You really do look...

01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:30.626
...radiant

01:01:32.209 --> 01:01:33.334
Thank you

01:01:33.376 --> 01:01:34.376
Who would have guessed...

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.667
...that Qianjin has as beautiful
a friend as you

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:38.959
She really is beautiful

01:01:39.209 --> 01:01:40.001
Who's your plastic surgeon?

01:01:40.376 --> 01:01:42.167
Go and slice the watermelon

01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:44.626
Don't mind her and that mouth of hers

01:01:44.959 --> 01:01:46.001
She's like my grandmother

01:01:46.084 --> 01:01:47.792
Yes, she is like Grandma

01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:50.001
Come in, I'll prepare dinner

01:01:53.959 --> 01:01:54.709
This way

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:58.251
Their rooms are on the second floor

01:01:58.251 --> 01:01:59.251
Mine is on the highest floor

01:02:01.126 --> 01:02:01.792
Almost there

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.042
Qianjin

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:06.209
I'm a little thirsty

01:02:06.292 --> 01:02:08.042
Could you get me a cup of juice?

01:02:08.042 --> 01:02:09.751
OK, just a second, I'll be right back

01:02:09.751 --> 01:02:10.959
Thanks

01:02:50.709 --> 01:02:52.376
Let's go to my room

01:02:52.459 --> 01:02:53.209
No

01:02:54.167 --> 01:02:55.209
To the living room

01:02:56.501 --> 01:02:59.167
Somebody your age inviting a girl
to your room...

01:03:02.959 --> 01:03:03.751
Don't eat so much

01:03:04.626 --> 01:03:05.417
Don't eat so much

01:03:05.584 --> 01:03:06.251
Screw you

01:03:09.542 --> 01:03:10.792
How strange

01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:49.834
Tastes good

01:03:49.876 --> 01:03:51.334
Tastes good? Hah!

01:03:52.042 --> 01:03:53.542
You'll have to do a better acting job than that

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:54.542
Xiang Xinran

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.834
Where are your manners?

01:03:59.584 --> 01:04:01.459
You want to act along too?

01:04:02.334 --> 01:04:03.292
You deserve it!

01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:05.417
What's the matter?

01:04:06.251 --> 01:04:07.876
Is it not to your liking?

01:04:09.626 --> 01:04:11.209
My grandma used to say

01:04:11.501 --> 01:04:14.459
This type of fish should first be fried
on both sides

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:18.584
then the soup will be clear yet full of flavor

01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:20.751
See mom, Lijun is so knowledgeable

01:04:23.334 --> 01:04:24.959
Yes, she's right

01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:30.376
ls their father not coming back to eat?

01:04:34.126 --> 01:04:36.209
He said he's busy, be back later than usual

01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:37.292
Let's eat

01:04:37.292 --> 01:04:38.876
It's so late already

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.834
Why isn't he back home yet?

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:43.626
You sure have a lot of complaints

01:04:43.667 --> 01:04:46.292
Mom, if this goes any further,
it won't be long...

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:47.959
...before Qianjin comes home one day
with a grandson

01:04:50.126 --> 01:04:51.376
- What are you two fussing about?
-I'm back

01:04:51.376 --> 01:04:52.126
Eat!

01:04:52.751 --> 01:04:53.834
You're back

01:05:04.209 --> 01:05:06.209
Could you tell me where the bathroom is?

01:05:06.209 --> 01:05:08.001
It's that direction, past the stairs

01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:08.876
I know

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:12.917
Who is she?

01:05:12.959 --> 01:05:14.126
Our band's lead singer

01:05:16.876 --> 01:05:17.876
What's the matter?

01:05:22.167 --> 01:05:23.751
Come eat first

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:25.167
I'll set you up

01:05:25.584 --> 01:05:27.126
I'll get changed first

01:05:51.584 --> 01:05:52.584
It's obvious...

01:05:52.584 --> 01:05:55.126
...that the suspect knew
our surveillance camera's location

01:05:55.167 --> 01:05:56.792
She purposely blocked it with that sunshade

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:58.501
She must be an expert

01:06:01.126 --> 01:06:02.542
What you're saying is...

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:05.251
...kidnapping is a real possibility?

01:06:05.251 --> 01:06:06.292
Very likely

01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:08.334
We can't rule out people close
to her as suspects

01:06:09.501 --> 01:06:11.709
ls your mother on bad terms with anybody...

01:06:12.042 --> 01:06:13.667
...or has she offended anybody recently?

01:06:14.709 --> 01:06:17.417
My mother typically treats everybody

01:06:17.959 --> 01:06:18.917
very nicely

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.917
She never offends anybody

01:06:37.251 --> 01:06:38.417
The Forward Band

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:44.209
Next contestant, get ready

01:06:50.292 --> 01:06:52.959
"even while staring into your eyes"

01:06:52.959 --> 01:06:55.501
"Even if you say no"

01:06:55.709 --> 01:06:58.501
"I still must ask"

01:06:58.501 --> 01:07:00.917
"I won't be discouraged"

01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:03.959
"even while staring at your lips"

01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:06.334
"Even if you don't respond"

01:07:06.751 --> 01:07:09.542
"I still must beg of you"

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:11.667
"I won't be sad"

01:07:35.626 --> 01:07:38.042
"Give me a kiss"

01:07:38.376 --> 01:07:39.542
"Yes or no?"

01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:40.751
Stop

01:07:51.792 --> 01:07:52.626
Have we met before?

01:07:52.626 --> 01:07:53.584
No we haven't

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:04.584
That day

01:08:04.959 --> 01:08:06.292
I'm sorry about what happened

01:08:06.959 --> 01:08:08.501
You weren't hurt, were you?

01:08:09.667 --> 01:08:10.709
I'm fine

01:08:11.959 --> 01:08:12.917
So you two know each other

01:08:15.501 --> 01:08:16.251
Oh right

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:18.542
There's a show next week at Live House

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:20.334
It's the preliminaries for the Music Festival,

01:08:20.334 --> 01:08:22.792
so it will be broadcast live on TV and the web

01:08:23.334 --> 01:08:24.292
I don't know...

01:08:24.376 --> 01:08:25.959
...if you all would like to join?

01:08:26.626 --> 01:08:28.084
Of course we would

01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:29.584
Boss

01:08:29.584 --> 01:08:31.709
I've already submitted the list of participants

01:08:32.251 --> 01:08:33.209
Don't worry everybody

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:34.751
She can arrange it

01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:37.626
I have a meeting to attend

01:08:37.626 --> 01:08:38.584
Read it over

01:08:38.584 --> 01:08:39.959
OK, See you

01:08:40.167 --> 01:08:41.126
Bye

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.709
Thank you

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:48.292
What is in this contract?

01:08:48.584 --> 01:08:50.501
We need to be careful with what we're signing

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:51.626
Lijun

01:08:51.834 --> 01:08:53.917
Maybe after this,
we'll be releasing albums next

01:08:54.626 --> 01:08:55.792
Really

01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:12.667
Stop dreaming

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:25.126
I'm back

01:09:27.834 --> 01:09:29.001
Anybody here?

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.876
And no lights on

01:09:44.417 --> 01:09:45.542
Batman

01:09:46.001 --> 01:09:48.917
Batman, how come you're here?

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.751
Where's everybody else?

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:52.709
Not here?

01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:54.417
And they left it pitch black for you?

01:10:44.917 --> 01:10:46.334
You idiot

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:48.792
Can't even aim properly

01:10:49.751 --> 01:10:51.167
What are you doing so late anyways?

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:52.334
Trying to kill me!

01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:54.376
Are you crazy? Have you gone mad?

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:56.834
What are you saying? You're so noisy!

01:10:58.709 --> 01:11:00.501
If you dare try anything,
I'll show you no mercy

01:11:10.167 --> 01:11:12.667
I should have seen through you long ago

01:11:13.042 --> 01:11:14.584
You're no good

01:11:14.584 --> 01:11:17.459
What have you done with our Mengjun? Tell me

01:11:18.834 --> 01:11:20.626
Those shoes you were carrying...

01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:22.376
...and the things in your suitcase

01:11:22.376 --> 01:11:23.751
Those are all Mengjun's

01:11:23.751 --> 01:11:25.417
You think I can't tell?

01:11:26.626 --> 01:11:28.001
What did you do to her?

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.709
What did you do to her?

01:11:29.709 --> 01:11:30.459
Killed her

01:11:34.334 --> 01:11:36.042
Tossed in the river, fish food

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:39.667
Mengjun

01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:43.167
You've been murdered!

01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:48.959
I don't want to live without you

01:11:50.501 --> 01:11:52.292
You can kill me too

01:11:52.292 --> 01:11:53.376
Kill me

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:57.042
Nobody else knows about your crimes

01:12:01.209 --> 01:12:03.667
Hurry up and kill me too

01:12:04.209 --> 01:12:07.459
I want to be with Mengjun

01:12:09.251 --> 01:12:10.584
What's so good about that granny anyways?

01:12:11.292 --> 01:12:12.709
What do you know?

01:12:14.751 --> 01:12:16.834
Do you know when Mengjun was younger,

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.751
how beautiful and sweet she was?

01:12:21.251 --> 01:12:24.417
I worked as a servant in their household
as a teen

01:12:25.084 --> 01:12:28.459
She never once looked down on me

01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:31.834
No matter how tough life got

01:12:31.876 --> 01:12:35.084
I just thought of Mengjun and I could persevere

01:12:36.126 --> 01:12:40.292
Just the sight of her made me so happy

01:12:41.167 --> 01:12:43.709
If it wasn't for my military enlistment...

01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:47.292
Who knows? We could have been together

01:13:00.667 --> 01:13:02.417
Since you love her so much

01:13:02.834 --> 01:13:04.542
How come you can't recognize me?

01:13:05.834 --> 01:13:07.209
What are you saying?

01:13:08.042 --> 01:13:10.042
Didn't you say you'd never forget my face?

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:11.501
Whose face?

01:13:13.876 --> 01:13:15.251
How about if I try this?

01:13:15.251 --> 01:13:18.042
What are you doing? Just kill me already

01:13:19.376 --> 01:13:20.751
You still can't recognize me?

01:13:20.751 --> 01:13:22.209
And you said you'd never forget my face

01:13:22.626 --> 01:13:23.917
What a bunch of nonsense!

01:13:31.917 --> 01:13:33.417
Can you recognize me like this then?

01:13:58.334 --> 01:13:59.834
I sure am jealous

01:14:05.167 --> 01:14:06.459
Next week

01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:08.334
I'm taping something at the TV station

01:14:08.834 --> 01:14:09.834
At the TV station?

01:14:10.376 --> 01:14:12.876
That rascal, Xiang Qianjin,
begged me all day to do it

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:14.876
I had no choice but to sign up

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:18.792
You're so young now,
why worry so much about Qianjin?

01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:20.876
To be honest

01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.001
I'm not just doing this for him

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:25.792
I wanted to sing when I was younger

01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:27.876
But back then, where could we go?

01:14:28.501 --> 01:14:30.376
Now I can seize this opportunity

01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:32.292
People want to listen to me now

01:14:33.042 --> 01:14:34.209
Who knows,

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.626
you may even become the next Teresa Teng

01:14:36.876 --> 01:14:37.959
Don't be so touchy-feely

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:42.001
Oh no, the photo is soaked

01:14:43.209 --> 01:14:44.709
Oh no, the whole thing!

01:14:47.542 --> 01:14:48.876
The subject is right here

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.501
What do you need the photo for?

01:14:50.751 --> 01:14:51.542
Here

01:15:18.167 --> 01:15:19.834
What did my mom say?

01:15:20.084 --> 01:15:22.001
Where exactly is she?

01:15:22.626 --> 01:15:24.876
Calm down one thing at a time

01:15:24.876 --> 01:15:26.792
Uncle Li, this is my mom here,
I can't just calm down

01:15:26.792 --> 01:15:27.876
Where did you see her?

01:15:28.584 --> 01:15:29.792
Your mom, she...

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:32.251
Your mom is like the wind

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:34.292
Here one minute, gone the next

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:37.709
However, she asked me to tell you,

01:15:38.084 --> 01:15:39.334
there's no need to worry about her

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.459
Really, don't worry

01:15:40.626 --> 01:15:43.209
This is a letter she left for you

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.501
Her fingerprint is on the bottom

01:15:50.459 --> 01:15:53.126
Well did my mom say when she will come back?

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:55.751
Your mom said

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:58.376
she wants to experience...

01:15:58.376 --> 01:15:59.584
...a different lifestyle

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:01.084
In the past,

01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:03.542
she did everything for the sake of others

01:16:04.501 --> 01:16:06.126
You two should know this

01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:09.042
Well now...

01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:11.792
Oh right, she requested...

01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:13.917
...that you remove the security freeze
on her credit cards

01:16:13.917 --> 01:16:15.959
It's been quite inconvenient for her

01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:16.917
How about?

01:16:17.167 --> 01:16:17.917
OK

01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:19.709
Since I'm here,

01:16:19.917 --> 01:16:21.834
can you help us with something else?

01:16:24.751 --> 01:16:26.084
What is it?

01:16:27.042 --> 01:16:29.376
You know how you wanted to send your mom...

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:30.667
...to a nursing home?

01:16:30.751 --> 01:16:31.667
Forget that

01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:33.542
She might as well live with me

01:16:33.626 --> 01:16:35.084
We'll be together

01:16:35.626 --> 01:16:36.834
It should be clone lawfully,

01:16:37.251 --> 01:16:39.251
so we will need to get a marriage certificate

01:16:39.876 --> 01:16:40.834
What?

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:42.459
What?

01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:43.709
You want to marry my mom?

01:16:43.709 --> 01:16:45.376
- Have you gone senile?
-Shut up

01:16:45.376 --> 01:16:46.709
What are you yelling at her for?

01:16:47.251 --> 01:16:48.417
A marriage certificate...

01:16:48.417 --> 01:16:50.126
...can only be done in person anyway

01:16:50.209 --> 01:16:51.001
Shut up

01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:51.792
It's none of your business

01:16:51.792 --> 01:16:52.917
What are you yelling at her for?

01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:53.876
You shut up

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:55.751
All you do is lose your temper with me

01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:58.292
This young lady, What's wrong
with me yelling at her?

01:16:58.709 --> 01:17:00.542
You're favoring her over your own daughter?

01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:02.126
Put that away

01:17:02.126 --> 01:17:03.084
Stop it

01:17:03.084 --> 01:17:04.417
Stop it, what are you doing

01:17:04.417 --> 01:17:05.834
You stop it

01:17:05.834 --> 01:17:08.292
- Stop it
-Stop

01:17:09.042 --> 01:17:09.751
You

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:11.792
Who do you think you are?

01:17:11.792 --> 01:17:12.667
Me

01:17:18.792 --> 01:17:19.876
A tenant

01:17:27.667 --> 01:17:29.751
Shen Mengjun is enough

01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:31.834
Now I have to deal with her

01:17:33.376 --> 01:17:34.626
What are you saying?

01:17:35.792 --> 01:17:38.167
That tenant of yours...

01:17:41.626 --> 01:17:43.709
...is surely up to something

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:45.709
Impossible

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:48.792
Girl

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:51.375
I can't blame you with your looks

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.876
But you weren't born yesterday

01:17:53.876 --> 01:17:55.792
Open your eyes!

01:17:56.751 --> 01:17:58.292
What are you talking about?

01:17:58.959 --> 01:18:00.501
She's only how old?

01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.001
What could she see in my dad?

01:18:02.042 --> 01:18:04.584
Also, what does my dad have that's so special?

01:18:05.834 --> 01:18:07.167
A house

01:18:08.167 --> 01:18:10.042
That must be worth millions

01:18:12.126 --> 01:18:14.459
Are you really that naive?

01:18:14.459 --> 01:18:16.209
Which one of you ate my pudding?

01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:21.542
Here, Duoduo

01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:23.709
Grandma will feed you some meat

01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:35.459
Hop aboard

01:18:36.334 --> 01:18:37.917
Li Dahai

01:18:38.084 --> 01:18:39.251
Are you mad?

01:18:39.667 --> 01:18:41.167
At your age?

01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:42.376
Are you flirting with me?

01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:45.167
For you

01:18:54.667 --> 01:18:56.917
I'll tell you, Ms. Wang

01:18:57.042 --> 01:18:59.376
I forgot to tell you earlier in the supermarket

01:18:59.376 --> 01:19:03.376
Two fifty per half kilo,
what a bargain for rice

01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:06.709
Hurry UP

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:10.584
"To love somebody is so hard"

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:15.709
"Why can't I do anything right?"

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:18.584
"Your love"

01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:22.751
"is my subway train"

01:19:26.292 --> 01:19:28.126
This song is a mess

01:19:28.542 --> 01:19:29.876
Who picked this band?

01:19:37.584 --> 01:19:38.834
Why don't we quit

01:19:45.459 --> 01:19:47.167
Look at those bands out there,

01:19:47.792 --> 01:19:49.584
all they care about is money

01:19:50.251 --> 01:19:51.917
I don't want us to become so commercialized

01:19:52.376 --> 01:19:53.792
After all, we never did this for the money

01:19:54.209 --> 01:19:56.042
We do this for the love of music, right?

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:58.209
Well, doing this isn't exactly cheap

01:20:01.751 --> 01:20:02.751
Right,

01:20:03.292 --> 01:20:04.292
let's quit

01:20:04.876 --> 01:20:05.876
After all, this opportunity...

01:20:05.876 --> 01:20:08.042
...was just a gift from Mr. Tan

01:20:08.334 --> 01:20:09.667
We didn't exactly earn this

01:20:09.876 --> 01:20:11.042
So if we quit now, it's no big deal

01:20:12.959 --> 01:20:14.334
If we don't compete, then we won't lose

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:16.959
If we don't lose,
then we won't injure our pride

01:20:19.459 --> 01:20:21.459
I've seen too many kids like you,

01:20:22.542 --> 01:20:24.209
they never amount to anything in life

01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:26.417
Let's just quit

01:20:27.667 --> 01:20:29.542
Don't take pity on yourselves later

01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:31.126
Don't start having regrets when you're older

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:32.334
Wait

01:20:35.084 --> 01:20:36.209
I don't want to have regrets

01:20:38.459 --> 01:20:40.334
Why don't we try again?

01:20:46.334 --> 01:20:47.584
Thank you

01:21:16.167 --> 01:21:17.376
Hello everybody

01:21:19.376 --> 01:21:21.751
We are The Forward Band

01:21:22.542 --> 01:21:23.751
I must apologize...

01:21:24.001 --> 01:21:26.417
...for our alteration to today's program

01:21:30.376 --> 01:21:32.917
Boss, you can't always make an exception
for them

01:21:33.126 --> 01:21:34.584
There's one song...

01:21:34.626 --> 01:21:36.084
...that is very dear to me

01:21:36.792 --> 01:21:38.376
It's because of this song...

01:21:39.042 --> 01:21:41.251
...that I have the courage to stand here today

01:21:59.501 --> 01:22:04.334
"Memories buried long ago"

01:22:06.251 --> 01:22:11.167
"broadcasting themselves into the night"

01:22:13.001 --> 01:22:15.709
"An old romance"

01:22:16.167 --> 01:22:18.376
"A shooting star falling from the sky"

01:22:18.376 --> 01:22:20.167
"has returned"

01:22:21.542 --> 01:22:24.001
"gnawing at my heart"

01:22:25.792 --> 01:22:30.084
"Teardrops buried long ago"

01:22:32.584 --> 01:22:37.084
"My thoughts, pounding at the window"

01:22:39.459 --> 01:22:44.876
"Muddy roads, the bumpy ride of romance"

01:22:44.917 --> 01:22:49.792
"Only clear blue skies remain"

01:22:51.209 --> 01:22:57.917
"Don't be discouraged, don't be sad"

01:22:58.001 --> 01:23:03.667
"This is what fate has taught me"

01:23:04.376 --> 01:23:08.459
"Suffering until you collapse without hope"

01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:17.084
"Time brews these into faintly sweet memories"

01:23:31.459 --> 01:23:35.917
"Teardrops buried long ago"

01:23:38.334 --> 01:23:42.876
"My thoughts, pounding at the window"

01:23:45.042 --> 01:23:47.626
"Muddy roads,"

01:23:48.126 --> 01:23:50.542
"the bumpy ride of romance"

01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:56.084
"Only clear blue skies remain"

01:23:57.084 --> 01:24:03.584
"Don't be discouraged, don't be sad"

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:09.584
"This is what fate has taught me"

01:24:10.084 --> 01:24:14.167
"Suffering until you collapse without hope"

01:24:14.251 --> 01:24:22.584
"Time brews these into faintly sweet memories"

01:24:23.334 --> 01:24:29.917
"Don't be discouraged, don't be worried"

01:24:30.126 --> 01:24:35.584
"The rain won't last forever"

01:24:36.376 --> 01:24:40.501
"Our separation, the suffocating distress"

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:48.876
"Reminiscing brews these into faintly
sweet memories"

01:24:49.542 --> 01:24:53.667
"Our separation, the suffocating distress"

01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:56.417
"Reminiscing brews these into"

01:24:56.542 --> 01:25:02.209
"faintly sweet memories"

01:25:02.667 --> 01:25:05.751
"The most enduring joy"

01:25:06.042 --> 01:25:09.084
"comes not from being with you"

01:25:09.209 --> 01:25:16.917
"but from the memories of our time together"

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:37.959
Isn't your skirt a bit too short?

01:25:39.459 --> 01:25:41.751
I said, isn't your skirt a bit too short?

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:45.751
You think so?

01:25:45.751 --> 01:25:46.834
Yes it is

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:49.042
Didn't I dress like this when I was younger?

01:25:49.042 --> 01:25:51.042
I would have never allowed you
to dress like this

01:25:53.251 --> 01:25:55.501
Were you the singer just now at Live House?

01:25:57.042 --> 01:25:59.209
I think you're so talented

01:26:03.001 --> 01:26:03.792
Let's dance

01:26:05.042 --> 01:26:06.042
What do you mean dance

01:26:07.042 --> 01:26:08.292
She's from your grandmother's generation

01:26:08.376 --> 01:26:09.167
Get lost

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:14.334
Drinks are here, let's drink

01:26:14.584 --> 01:26:16.751
Mr. Tan is covering the tab, drink as you wish

01:26:19.042 --> 01:26:20.792
You all performed brilliantly today

01:26:20.917 --> 01:26:23.042
I just received a call from the Music Festival

01:26:23.126 --> 01:26:24.667
They'd like to invite you to perform

01:26:25.042 --> 01:26:25.792
Really?

01:26:25.917 --> 01:26:26.917
What invitation

01:26:26.917 --> 01:26:28.876
I had to pull a lot of strings to arrange that

01:26:29.542 --> 01:26:31.542
Although you must perform original songs
next time

01:26:31.542 --> 01:26:32.251
Ah?

01:26:32.251 --> 01:26:33.084
Original songs

01:26:33.751 --> 01:26:34.501
Good luck

01:26:34.917 --> 01:26:35.709
I won't let you down

01:26:35.876 --> 01:26:37.251
Let's celebrate

01:26:37.334 --> 01:26:38.876
Cheers

01:26:41.334 --> 01:26:42.917
Let's head to the dance floor

01:26:44.376 --> 01:26:45.251
-OK
-OK

01:26:52.209 --> 01:26:53.209
You guys go

01:26:53.834 --> 01:26:55.167
I'll stick here with Grandpa Li

01:26:58.417 --> 01:27:00.251
You don't need to stay here with me

01:27:01.334 --> 01:27:02.251
We'll go together

01:27:02.959 --> 01:27:03.917
You?

01:27:04.626 --> 01:27:07.709
This music beats faster than your heart

01:27:15.292 --> 01:27:16.376
Let's dance

01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:30.751
What's your problem?

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:31.917
Stop!

01:27:32.251 --> 01:27:33.542
Are you looking for a fight?

01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:35.126
It's none of your business, get lost

01:27:35.501 --> 01:27:36.667
Turn the music off

01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:39.667
I'm sorry

01:27:42.001 --> 01:27:43.209
I thought

01:27:43.251 --> 01:27:45.292
Grandpa was just here with his granddaughter

01:27:45.376 --> 01:27:46.542
Who could have guessed,

01:27:46.542 --> 01:27:48.126
you're actually a dirty old creep

01:27:48.126 --> 01:27:50.667
What did you say? Show some decency

01:27:50.667 --> 01:27:51.792
Let's get out of here

01:27:51.792 --> 01:27:52.917
Who has no decency?

01:27:53.292 --> 01:27:54.084
Come back here

01:27:54.084 --> 01:27:56.292
Everybody look at this dirty old creep

01:27:56.292 --> 01:27:58.126
This old thing here shameless

01:28:00.251 --> 01:28:01.501
Let's go

01:28:03.042 --> 01:28:04.292
Did I say anything wrong?

01:28:04.292 --> 01:28:05.126
Don't move

01:28:08.042 --> 01:28:09.084
Ever served in the military?

01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:11.126
- Served in what?
-Ever driven a tank?

01:28:11.584 --> 01:28:13.417
I'll bet you've never even laid hands
on a gun before

01:28:20.251 --> 01:28:21.834
Field army unit, decorated artillery officer

01:28:21.834 --> 01:28:23.126
Honorary merit citation, second class

01:28:23.376 --> 01:28:25.001
First class

01:28:28.334 --> 01:28:30.501
Look at yourself, throwing bottles
and starting fights

01:28:31.209 --> 01:28:32.917
If you're so tough,
why don't you serve our country?

01:28:39.834 --> 01:28:40.834
Let's go

01:28:42.334 --> 01:28:43.209
Let's go

01:28:43.542 --> 01:28:44.292
Yeah

01:28:49.959 --> 01:28:51.251
You're bleeding

01:28:51.917 --> 01:28:53.584
Cindy, get bandaids and disinfectant

01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:54.417
OK

01:28:55.834 --> 01:28:56.709
Let me take a look

01:28:57.584 --> 01:28:58.417
It's no big deal

01:28:58.667 --> 01:28:59.751
We'll leave first

01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:02.209
Lijun

01:29:02.417 --> 01:29:03.209
Let's go then

01:29:03.459 --> 01:29:04.167
Let's go

01:29:10.251 --> 01:29:11.959
How could this be?

01:29:12.126 --> 01:29:14.251
Looks like we'll have to try this

01:29:18.959 --> 01:29:20.209
You old dog

01:29:20.584 --> 01:29:21.792
Trying to stab me to death?

01:29:36.917 --> 01:29:38.001
Are you sure about this?

01:29:39.501 --> 01:29:40.292
Go ahead

01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:41.501
It doesn't hurt too much

01:29:45.626 --> 01:29:46.501
Is it OK?

01:29:46.876 --> 01:29:48.042
It's fine

01:29:53.834 --> 01:29:56.584
It seems the skin around your injury has aged

01:29:59.126 --> 01:30:00.959
So there is a way to return to your old self

01:30:05.792 --> 01:30:06.917
But I suppose,

01:30:08.834 --> 01:30:10.834
you may not want that right?

01:30:11.792 --> 01:30:14.001
Why are you still up at this hour
with all the noise?

01:30:20.376 --> 01:30:22.167
- Those are her belongings
-You shameless fox,

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:23.376
you get out of here

01:30:24.084 --> 01:30:25.584
What are you just standing there for?

01:30:25.584 --> 01:30:26.834
- Still not leaving?
-Just let me explain

01:30:26.834 --> 01:30:27.584
Out

01:30:27.584 --> 01:30:28.667
What are you doing?

01:30:29.209 --> 01:30:30.501
What am I doing?

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:33.709
Dad, Why are you still protecting her?

01:30:33.959 --> 01:30:35.709
Did that fox put you under her spell?

01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:37.251
You're already this old

01:30:37.376 --> 01:30:39.001
Even if you're not ashamed, I am

01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:40.542
Do you know who she is?

01:30:40.542 --> 01:30:41.834
Who? That fox

01:30:41.959 --> 01:30:43.334
And you even asked me to call her mom!

01:30:43.334 --> 01:30:45.792
Don't go

01:30:45.792 --> 01:30:46.501
You get out of here

01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:47.751
You crazy girl

01:31:14.501 --> 01:31:15.376
Hello?

01:31:16.167 --> 01:31:17.501
Mr. Tan

01:31:17.876 --> 01:31:18.917
Are you back home?

01:31:19.959 --> 01:31:20.834
I wanted to make sure you were OK

01:31:20.834 --> 01:31:22.251
So I just called to check in

01:31:27.792 --> 01:31:28.584
Hello?

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:30.626
Is everything alright?

01:31:36.084 --> 01:31:39.126
I'm terribly sorry to disturb you so late

01:31:39.626 --> 01:31:41.251
I forgot my keys

01:31:41.667 --> 01:31:43.709
and the landlord is staying
with relatives tonight

01:31:48.126 --> 01:31:49.042
Here

01:31:52.376 --> 01:31:53.084
Give it to me

01:31:59.917 --> 01:32:02.167
I'll sleep here, you sleep upstairs

01:32:02.292 --> 01:32:04.251
I can't, I'll sleep here

01:32:04.251 --> 01:32:05.459
- I'm the guest
-good night

01:32:57.001 --> 01:32:57.917
What is it?

01:32:59.126 --> 01:33:00.001
The light's still on

01:33:02.292 --> 01:33:03.334
Thanks

01:33:05.626 --> 01:33:06.584
Back to bed

01:33:14.584 --> 01:33:16.292
Why do you sleep with the light on?

01:33:16.834 --> 01:33:17.959
What a waste of electricity

01:33:19.834 --> 01:33:20.751
You're right

01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:23.584
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

01:33:24.626 --> 01:33:25.751
How could that be?

01:33:28.417 --> 01:33:29.376
Good night

01:33:30.792 --> 01:33:31.876
Good night

01:34:02.126 --> 01:34:03.042
Still in denial?

01:34:06.001 --> 01:34:07.626
I was going to the bathroom

01:34:10.876 --> 01:34:12.084
Come

01:34:14.959 --> 01:34:17.042
Don't be ashamed to admit it

01:34:18.126 --> 01:34:19.751
- Lie down
-I'm really not

01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:20.542
Lie down

01:34:20.542 --> 01:34:22.167
Quick

01:34:23.292 --> 01:34:24.959
Our family's Little Button

01:34:25.042 --> 01:34:26.709
was also afraid of the dark

01:34:27.001 --> 01:34:28.417
Who is Little Button?

01:34:29.042 --> 01:34:30.459
A relative's child

01:34:31.626 --> 01:34:32.459
Come

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:34.834
I'll teach you a way to get over your fear

01:34:34.834 --> 01:34:36.417
I'm really not afraid of the dark

01:34:36.459 --> 01:34:37.542
Give me your hand

01:34:38.084 --> 01:34:39.042
Give it to me

01:34:40.834 --> 01:34:42.167
Close your eyes

01:34:43.792 --> 01:34:45.376
Close them, come on

01:34:46.834 --> 01:34:48.167
Let's count to five

01:34:49.959 --> 01:34:50.876
One

01:34:51.459 --> 01:34:52.251
Two

01:34:53.417 --> 01:34:54.209
Three

01:34:55.459 --> 01:34:56.334
Four

01:34:57.959 --> 01:34:58.834
Five

01:35:07.042 --> 01:35:09.042
It's not as dark as you thought,

01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:10.709
right?

01:35:18.292 --> 01:35:20.542
All we need is a little time

01:35:20.667 --> 01:35:22.126
to adjust to the dark

01:35:25.834 --> 01:35:26.667
OK

01:35:27.292 --> 01:35:29.001
Now you won't be afraid anymore

01:35:31.001 --> 01:35:31.917
Sleep

01:36:04.209 --> 01:36:05.167
Mom

01:36:05.334 --> 01:36:06.917
Are you back?

01:36:08.042 --> 01:36:08.792
It's me

01:36:10.751 --> 01:36:11.876
Are you not feeling well?

01:36:12.001 --> 01:36:13.334
You should go to bed

01:36:15.834 --> 01:36:17.167
I've slept long enough

01:36:24.376 --> 01:36:25.334
Xinran

01:36:26.667 --> 01:36:28.501
You should be nicer
to your future mother-in-law

01:36:29.209 --> 01:36:30.459
I know

01:36:30.542 --> 01:36:31.876
Be nicer to mother-in-law

01:36:31.876 --> 01:36:33.126
Be less nice to daughter-in-law

01:36:36.084 --> 01:36:37.917
That young lady really is your mother

01:36:40.751 --> 01:36:43.417
Students, class dismissed, you're free to go

01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:51.251
I know you must be skeptical
of what I'm saying,

01:36:51.376 --> 01:36:52.959
but you must believe me

01:36:55.417 --> 01:36:56.917
What you're saying is

01:36:57.459 --> 01:36:59.459
Last time you told me you saw my mom,

01:37:00.376 --> 01:37:01.709
you were referring to that young lady?

01:37:01.834 --> 01:37:02.667
Correct

01:37:02.667 --> 01:37:04.459
Lijun is Mengjun

01:37:04.459 --> 01:37:06.792
You're her son and you can't tell?

01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:09.376
Lijun is Mengjun?

01:37:11.167 --> 01:37:13.042
Ah yes, I have a photograph

01:37:13.501 --> 01:37:15.042
This is your mom when she was younger

01:37:15.542 --> 01:37:16.376
Have a look

01:37:21.959 --> 01:37:22.959
Right?

01:37:25.042 --> 01:37:25.959
Uncle Li,

01:37:26.917 --> 01:37:28.167
when did this start?

01:37:28.376 --> 01:37:30.042
It was when she left your home

01:37:30.542 --> 01:37:31.959
I never would have imagined

01:37:33.292 --> 01:37:34.834
My mom leaving home...

01:37:35.792 --> 01:37:37.376
...would impact you this much

01:37:41.584 --> 01:37:43.626
Nothing to be scared of,
A disease can be treated...

01:37:44.251 --> 01:37:46.042
...especially with these early-stage symptoms

01:37:46.084 --> 01:37:47.292
Surely there is a way

01:37:47.376 --> 01:37:49.501
I have a friend
who is a specialist in this area

01:37:49.584 --> 01:37:51.542
You have what is called Alzheimer's disease

01:37:51.542 --> 01:37:53.126
I'm not suffering from Alzheimer's disease

01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:56.209
You brat, you can't even recognize
your own mom?

01:37:56.209 --> 01:37:57.376
For crying out loud

01:38:06.376 --> 01:38:09.334
Hello, is anybody home? Delivery

01:38:17.376 --> 01:38:18.292
Hello

01:38:18.917 --> 01:38:20.084
Jingdong Express

01:38:22.792 --> 01:38:23.959
Please sign here

01:38:27.376 --> 01:38:28.251
Thanks

01:38:28.626 --> 01:38:30.084
Boss, are you home?

01:38:30.209 --> 01:38:32.126
I've been calling you, why didn't you pick up?

01:38:32.167 --> 01:38:34.417
I have some important documents
that need your signature

01:38:34.667 --> 01:38:36.251
Just sign in these areas

01:38:36.251 --> 01:38:37.334
You're up?

01:38:53.042 --> 01:38:58.167
"Black flowers"

01:38:59.001 --> 01:39:04.001
"White hair flows"

01:39:05.001 --> 01:39:07.667
-"Blue..."
-Stop

01:39:12.084 --> 01:39:13.501
This is really not good enough

01:39:15.542 --> 01:39:17.501
Maybe it's best if I find a songwriter to help

01:39:19.167 --> 01:39:20.417
Cindy, can the copyright team

01:39:20.417 --> 01:39:21.709
recommend somebody?

01:39:22.126 --> 01:39:23.126
Ask Zheng

01:39:24.167 --> 01:39:25.126
Cindy

01:39:25.334 --> 01:39:26.251
Mr. Tan

01:39:27.334 --> 01:39:28.501
I've submitted this many songs

01:39:28.501 --> 01:39:29.959
Not a single one is to your liking

01:39:30.667 --> 01:39:32.417
At the very least, I deserve some feedback

01:39:32.959 --> 01:39:34.959
I'll admit your performance last time was great

01:39:35.459 --> 01:39:37.876
But you don't have to stick to the same style

01:39:39.084 --> 01:39:40.292
What do you mean?

01:39:44.292 --> 01:39:45.542
OK band leader

01:39:45.917 --> 01:39:47.917
All your music sounds copied

01:39:48.334 --> 01:39:49.542
That's what I'm saying

01:39:50.042 --> 01:39:51.459
I understand you now

01:39:53.084 --> 01:39:54.959
Anyway, the only person here good enough
for you is

01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:57.001
Meng Lijun

01:40:00.042 --> 01:40:02.334
Qianjin, what are you doing?

01:40:03.042 --> 01:40:04.251
You of all people should know

01:40:05.667 --> 01:40:06.542
Cindy

01:40:08.667 --> 01:40:09.792
I'll talk to her

01:40:11.167 --> 01:40:12.209
Lijun

01:40:12.376 --> 01:40:14.001
Are you and Mr. Tan really together?

01:40:14.751 --> 01:40:17.209
Can you not tell that Qianjin likes you?

01:40:38.501 --> 01:40:40.542
Trying to win sympathy in the rain
is so outdated

01:40:41.667 --> 01:40:42.917
What do you want?

01:40:43.834 --> 01:40:45.084
Nothing

01:40:45.792 --> 01:40:47.376
You're thinking too much

01:40:49.459 --> 01:40:51.667
Are you and Mr. Tan really together?

01:40:53.167 --> 01:40:54.667
So what if we are?

01:40:54.667 --> 01:40:56.376
And so what if we're not?

01:40:59.584 --> 01:41:01.376
It seems that you and I will never be

01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:09.042
Young people, turned down once
and you get so dejected

01:41:17.334 --> 01:41:20.126
You will definitely meet somebody...

01:41:20.126 --> 01:41:23.334
...who you will love
and who will love you back too,

01:41:23.584 --> 01:41:26.709
because you're such a talented and good person

01:41:27.584 --> 01:41:28.876
How would you know?

01:41:30.626 --> 01:41:32.126
I just know

01:41:45.959 --> 01:41:46.876
Peach

01:42:01.459 --> 01:42:02.792
I haven't seen that granny...

01:42:02.792 --> 01:42:05.334
...who was going to America recently

01:42:05.959 --> 01:42:07.042
She's in the hospital

01:42:09.959 --> 01:42:11.584
But she seemed perfectly fine

01:42:12.334 --> 01:42:13.751
At this age,

01:42:13.751 --> 01:42:15.709
who knows when problems will arise?

01:42:27.126 --> 01:42:28.292
I have something to ask

01:42:28.959 --> 01:42:29.959
You go first

01:42:31.917 --> 01:42:33.417
ls your daughter doing OK?

01:42:34.959 --> 01:42:37.042
She's been spoiled by me ever
since she was little

01:42:37.042 --> 01:42:38.084
Don't worry about her

01:42:41.459 --> 01:42:42.626
What did you want to ask?

01:42:47.251 --> 01:42:49.751
Have you been seeing somebody lately?

01:42:54.667 --> 01:42:56.459
The way you're acting

01:42:57.209 --> 01:43:00.126
Reminds me of when you had just met
Guobin's father

01:43:07.376 --> 01:43:09.251
Actually, I'm not so sure

01:43:10.459 --> 01:43:12.959
We're really just not meant to be

01:43:16.209 --> 01:43:18.751
In my life, I've missed the opportunity twice

01:43:24.626 --> 01:43:28.417
Don't be so sappy, you're this old already

01:43:29.417 --> 01:43:30.709
Yes

01:43:31.167 --> 01:43:33.167
I am this old already

01:43:33.626 --> 01:43:35.542
But you are still young

01:43:45.542 --> 01:43:48.001
Don't visit me anymore

01:43:48.834 --> 01:43:50.959
A young lady like you...

01:43:52.501 --> 01:43:56.126
...hanging around an old man all clay,
what will people think?

01:44:05.126 --> 01:44:06.292
Are you OK?

01:44:10.001 --> 01:44:11.084
Fine

01:44:13.292 --> 01:44:14.542
Oh right

01:44:19.542 --> 01:44:20.917
I was taking a stroll today...

01:44:21.209 --> 01:44:22.917
...and saw a nice hairpin

01:44:27.292 --> 01:44:29.001
I think it would look good on you

01:44:32.501 --> 01:44:33.542
I'll help you put it on

01:44:41.084 --> 01:44:42.126
Sorry

01:44:55.292 --> 01:44:56.334
First time doing this

01:45:02.834 --> 01:45:03.876
Mr. Tan

01:45:07.001 --> 01:45:08.251
Do you like me?

01:45:19.334 --> 01:45:20.542
Yes

01:45:24.792 --> 01:45:26.251
If one day...

01:45:27.459 --> 01:45:29.084
...I become old,

01:45:30.376 --> 01:45:31.501
my hair turns white...

01:45:32.876 --> 01:45:34.542
...and my skin becomes wrinkled like paper

01:45:36.417 --> 01:45:38.167
Would you still like me?

01:45:39.167 --> 01:45:42.084
I'll be older than you for sure
if that day one day comes

01:45:46.542 --> 01:45:48.501
You'll regret it then

01:45:53.417 --> 01:45:54.542
We only have one life to live

01:45:55.626 --> 01:45:57.376
Once I make a decision, I don't hold regrets

01:46:17.876 --> 01:46:18.542
Hello

01:46:29.959 --> 01:46:32.209
Don't worry, I'm sure your friend is fine

01:46:34.542 --> 01:46:35.459
Thank you

01:46:56.917 --> 01:46:58.251
Mr. Tan

01:47:02.209 --> 01:47:03.709
Thank you for the hairpin

01:47:05.751 --> 01:47:06.876
You're welcome

01:47:16.084 --> 01:47:18.126
Young lady, can you help me see...

01:47:18.209 --> 01:47:20.209
...if there is a patient named Chen Yumei

01:47:20.334 --> 01:47:21.501
Which room is she in?

01:47:21.542 --> 01:47:23.376
Dr. Ye, listen

01:47:23.459 --> 01:47:24.626
Our landlord's daughter is in America,

01:47:24.626 --> 01:47:26.542
she can't come here now

01:47:26.542 --> 01:47:27.584
Please help us

01:47:27.584 --> 01:47:29.001
This is hospital regulation

01:47:29.001 --> 01:47:30.542
Only the deceased person's immediate family...

01:47:30.542 --> 01:47:32.334
...can sign the death certificate

01:47:32.584 --> 01:47:34.626
Given the time difference with America,

01:47:34.834 --> 01:47:36.626
we simply can't get in touch with her daughter

01:47:36.751 --> 01:47:37.417
Look!

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:39.917
We have been her tenants for so many years

01:47:39.917 --> 01:47:41.334
Can't we just sign it?

01:47:41.334 --> 01:47:43.334
I'm sorry, we must abide by regulations

01:47:49.251 --> 01:47:50.251
Grandpa Li

01:47:55.209 --> 01:47:57.292
I really must apologize...

01:47:57.292 --> 01:47:59.042
...for disturbing you so late

01:48:00.126 --> 01:48:02.126
I simply had no choice

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:05.084
In Aunt Chen's cell phone contacts,

01:48:05.084 --> 01:48:06.667
besides her daughter,

01:48:06.667 --> 01:48:09.542
there is only you and somebody named
Shen Mengjun

01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:11.959
So...

01:48:11.959 --> 01:48:14.751
It's nothing, thank you

01:48:15.167 --> 01:48:16.376
I'll take care of the paperwork

01:48:17.042 --> 01:48:17.876
Thank you

01:50:21.626 --> 01:50:23.834
The drummer enters the stage from here...

01:50:24.209 --> 01:50:25.459
Look

01:50:25.792 --> 01:50:26.459
There

01:50:26.667 --> 01:50:27.792
So many bands

01:50:28.334 --> 01:50:29.334
Where is Xiang Qianjin?

01:50:29.876 --> 01:50:30.667
Qianjin, he

01:50:30.667 --> 01:50:32.584
Qianjin is in the restroom, he'll be back soon

01:50:32.584 --> 01:50:33.292
It's almost your turn

01:50:33.292 --> 01:50:34.501
you'd better tell him to hurry up

01:50:34.501 --> 01:50:35.251
OK

01:50:37.876 --> 01:50:39.417
There are three bands in front of us

01:50:39.792 --> 01:50:42.167
How much time for each band?

01:50:42.376 --> 01:50:43.501
Quick

01:50:43.667 --> 01:50:44.751
Where is Qianjin?

01:50:44.751 --> 01:50:45.959
Qianjin went back to the hotel

01:50:45.959 --> 01:50:47.376
He forgot some sound equipment

01:50:47.876 --> 01:50:49.001
Can he make it in time?

01:50:49.001 --> 01:50:50.042
Yes

01:50:50.042 --> 01:50:51.917
He borrowed a bicycle and he'll be here soon

01:52:04.167 --> 01:52:05.001
Cindy

01:52:06.542 --> 01:52:07.959
It's almost time, ask them to get ready

01:52:07.959 --> 01:52:09.376
I'm calling Qianjin

01:52:09.542 --> 01:52:10.876
He's not back yet? Tell him to hurry

01:52:10.876 --> 01:52:11.626
OK

01:52:14.376 --> 01:52:15.542
Hello Qianjin

01:52:17.626 --> 01:52:19.501
Yes, I meant to dial this number

01:52:26.376 --> 01:52:27.084
What?

01:52:28.542 --> 01:52:30.917
I must apologize,
our guitarist got into an accident

01:52:31.251 --> 01:52:33.584
We can just change the rundown

01:52:33.584 --> 01:52:34.376
Don't worry

01:52:34.376 --> 01:52:37.042
Cindy, work with the organizers
to sort this out

01:52:37.042 --> 01:52:37.876
OK

01:52:38.084 --> 01:52:40.417
Lijun, we should go to the hospital

01:52:41.334 --> 01:52:43.042
We should still perform

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:47.542
Qianjin worked so hard...

01:52:48.959 --> 01:52:51.001
...to give us the chance to perform
on this stage

01:52:52.251 --> 01:52:53.917
If we don't do this,

01:52:55.667 --> 01:52:58.209
then all of Qianjin's efforts will be
for nothing

01:52:59.626 --> 01:53:02.001
We'll realize his dream...

01:53:07.876 --> 01:53:10.167
...and then we can tell him...

01:53:11.126 --> 01:53:13.042
...just how great his song is

01:53:16.167 --> 01:53:16.959
OK

01:53:18.417 --> 01:53:19.167
Cindy

01:53:19.626 --> 01:53:21.542
Proceed as usual, call them back

01:53:21.917 --> 01:53:22.792
- Hurry
-OK

01:53:56.167 --> 01:54:00.376
"I've reached my destination"

01:54:01.751 --> 01:54:06.042
"but I'm back at the start"

01:54:06.959 --> 01:54:09.667
"A new world"

01:54:09.667 --> 01:54:12.501
"I've only just discovered"

01:54:12.792 --> 01:54:16.834
"time is not absolute"

01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:22.542
"When you meet that person"

01:54:24.167 --> 01:54:28.792
"who understands how you feel"

01:54:29.292 --> 01:54:31.917
"Without speaking or asking"

01:54:32.042 --> 01:54:35.001
"you know, you understand that"

01:54:35.167 --> 01:54:40.251
"every moment is like an eternity"

01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:44.959
"I see, there's not much time left"

01:54:44.959 --> 01:54:49.501
"Can I make a wish?
I'm desperate for one more day"

01:54:49.501 --> 01:54:51.834
"Our tomorrow"

01:54:51.876 --> 01:54:56.126
"I ask, how much time is left?"

01:54:56.126 --> 01:55:00.626
"Before my eyes, I thought we had one more day"

01:55:00.751 --> 01:55:05.834
"to fulfill our prophecy"

01:55:14.251 --> 01:55:18.334
"When you meet that person"

01:55:19.876 --> 01:55:24.501
"who understands how you feel"

01:55:25.167 --> 01:55:27.876
"Without speaking or asking"

01:55:27.876 --> 01:55:30.751
"you know, you understand that"

01:55:31.001 --> 01:55:36.001
"every moment is like an eternity"

01:55:36.542 --> 01:55:40.792
"I see, there's not much time left"

01:55:40.792 --> 01:55:45.292
"Can I make a wish?
I'm desperate for one more day"

01:55:45.292 --> 01:55:47.667
"Our tomorrow"

01:55:47.751 --> 01:55:51.876
"I ask, how much time is left?"

01:55:51.876 --> 01:55:56.292
"Before my eyes, I thought we had one more day"

01:55:56.501 --> 01:56:00.292
"to fulfill our prophecy"

01:56:00.292 --> 01:56:03.084
"In fact, there is a legend"

01:56:03.084 --> 01:56:05.876
"that the clock can be turned back"

01:56:05.876 --> 01:56:10.126
"because I once heard in a dream"

01:56:10.126 --> 01:56:15.459
"Love never holds back,
that's what gives me strength"

01:56:16.292 --> 01:56:21.167
"I see, there's not much time left"

01:56:21.167 --> 01:56:26.334
"Can I make a wish?
I'm desperate for one more day"

01:56:26.334 --> 01:56:29.126
"Our tomorrow"

01:56:29.209 --> 01:56:34.251
"I ask, how much time is left?"

01:56:34.251 --> 01:56:39.501
"Before my eyes, I thought we had one more day"

01:56:39.501 --> 01:56:45.167
"to fulfill our prophecy"

01:56:46.167 --> 01:56:50.001
"it has built up into an eternity"

01:56:51.917 --> 01:56:56.501
"of memories"

01:57:12.459 --> 01:57:13.459
Where's Lijun?

01:57:13.459 --> 01:57:15.042
She rushed to the hospital
after the performance

01:57:15.042 --> 01:57:16.501
We should go over too

01:57:16.501 --> 01:57:17.792
Quickly

01:57:21.209 --> 01:57:22.709
Are you family members of Qianjin?

01:57:23.167 --> 01:57:23.917
Yes

01:57:24.334 --> 01:57:25.792
Does anybody have the same blood type
as the patient?

01:57:25.792 --> 01:57:27.292
Rh-AB?

01:57:27.292 --> 01:57:29.417
What's the matter?
ls there a blood supply shortage?

01:57:29.792 --> 01:57:31.751
Our hospital doesn't carry a large supply

01:57:31.792 --> 01:57:33.209
We have already tried contacting
other hospitals...

01:57:33.209 --> 01:57:34.917
...but time is running out

01:57:35.292 --> 01:57:37.667
Does anybody here have the same blood type
as him?

01:57:38.126 --> 01:57:40.751
Only Grandma and Qianjin have that blood type

01:57:41.001 --> 01:57:42.084
What do we do?

01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:44.667
I'm coming

01:57:45.542 --> 01:57:47.251
My blood type is the same as his

01:57:48.042 --> 01:57:49.626
Hold on

01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:52.084
I'd like to have a word with her

01:57:57.792 --> 01:57:59.417
Don't stop me

01:57:59.417 --> 01:58:02.167
Have you thought what this will mean for you?

01:58:03.001 --> 01:58:04.167
I'm here to save my grandson

01:58:04.792 --> 01:58:06.501
Listen to me

01:58:07.584 --> 01:58:09.834
You've worked so hard to become
a successful singer...

01:58:10.501 --> 01:58:12.751
...and you've just met somebody you like

01:58:14.376 --> 01:58:15.751
Think this through

01:58:17.917 --> 01:58:19.001
Doing this,

01:58:19.959 --> 01:58:21.292
is it really worth it?

01:58:44.334 --> 01:58:45.667
Let's draw my blood

01:58:47.042 --> 01:58:48.001
Lijun, my friend

01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:53.959
I'd like to ask

01:58:56.126 --> 01:58:58.542
If you know a woman by the name of Shen Mengjun

01:59:01.792 --> 01:59:02.917
Do you?

01:59:08.417 --> 01:59:09.542
I do

01:59:13.334 --> 01:59:15.251
She was so beautiful when she was young...

01:59:18.167 --> 01:59:20.167
...but unfortunately,
her husband died very early...

01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:23.376
...leaving her with a child
who just had his first birthday

01:59:25.501 --> 01:59:27.251
The sacrifices she made raising this child...

01:59:30.167 --> 01:59:31.417
...were extraordinary

01:59:31.792 --> 01:59:33.376
Even heavy manual labor, she did it all

01:59:38.084 --> 01:59:40.209
Because that child had such fragile health,

01:59:41.626 --> 01:59:43.084
she feared he wouldn't make it

01:59:44.792 --> 01:59:46.959
So he gave him a nickname, Little Button

01:59:51.167 --> 01:59:53.376
Every time that child was seriously ill,

01:59:55.209 --> 01:59:57.251
she would hold him tightly and cry

01:59:57.501 --> 01:59:59.542
Little Button

02:00:01.209 --> 02:00:03.376
You must hold on tight to your life

02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:12.834
She sacrificed everything for this child

02:00:14.292 --> 02:00:15.459
But in the end,

02:00:16.167 --> 02:00:18.834
this ungrateful child wanted to send her
to a nursing home

02:00:24.667 --> 02:00:26.042
If you do know her

02:00:28.417 --> 02:00:29.917
Please tell her

02:00:31.417 --> 02:00:33.334
Don't come back to this house again

02:00:35.751 --> 02:00:37.959
Don't marry a husband who dies early again

02:00:39.001 --> 02:00:41.167
Don't bother having such an ungrateful
son again...

02:00:43.001 --> 02:00:46.792
...and don't mend shoes
and clothes for that child's sake

02:00:49.792 --> 02:00:52.626
If she could do it all over again,

02:00:54.209 --> 02:00:56.584
this time, don't make the same mistakes

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:07.626
You should go

02:01:10.542 --> 02:01:12.709
He's my child, I'll save him

02:01:17.334 --> 02:01:18.292
No

02:01:21.626 --> 02:01:24.334
If she could do it all over again,

02:01:25.834 --> 02:01:27.459
she wouldn't change a thing

02:01:41.334 --> 02:01:42.334
Because only this way...

02:01:44.042 --> 02:01:45.751
...would I be your mother,

02:01:47.584 --> 02:01:49.667
and you my son

02:01:52.751 --> 02:01:53.959
Isn't that right,

02:01:55.459 --> 02:01:56.334
Little Button

02:03:21.792 --> 02:03:24.001
I had a beautiful dream

02:03:26.292 --> 02:03:27.126
Really

02:03:27.584 --> 02:03:30.292
If I tell you, you may not even believe me

02:03:42.584 --> 02:03:44.751
Qianjin

02:03:44.751 --> 02:03:46.584
Guobin, look at Xinran

02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:59.251
What great singing

02:04:03.626 --> 02:04:05.251
My child is such a good singer

02:04:05.959 --> 02:04:07.751
Mom, that's my child,

02:04:07.751 --> 02:04:09.376
yours is right here

02:04:09.376 --> 02:04:12.001
She inherited those musical genes from me

02:04:12.542 --> 02:04:14.542
Alright then, we're all your children

02:04:15.126 --> 02:04:17.251
Yangqin, you're tone deaf

02:04:17.251 --> 02:04:18.834
How could you be my child?

02:04:19.334 --> 02:04:21.376
Guobin, help me out here, quickly

02:04:21.876 --> 02:04:22.751
You dare?

02:04:23.417 --> 02:04:24.376
Mom

02:04:25.376 --> 02:04:26.209
Mom

02:05:56.626 --> 02:05:57.417
Bye!

02:05:58.042 --> 02:05:58.959
Bye!

02:06:00.209 --> 02:06:01.292
No bloopers

02:06:02.305 --> 02:06:08.857
