00:55.789 --> 00:56.990
We shouldn't be here.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.769
This is where those
people were murdered.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.395
That is true, Emily.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.897
Those boys, they were just kids.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.768
They murdered the
resort employees here,

01:08.269 --> 01:11.105
- and the cops never caught them.
- Those were just stories, Em.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.276
Listen, I pulled
a lot of strings

01:15.476 --> 01:17.411
and made some calls
to get us this area.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.712
But why here?

01:19.247 --> 01:21.282
Look around, we're
totally alone.

01:22.750 --> 01:23.884
No distractions.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.087
It's a peaceful place.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.458
Hey, please just trust me.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.230
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:40.868 --> 01:41.869
Close your eyes.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.113
Open them.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.319
Open it.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.557
Charlie.

02:06.894 --> 02:11.131
Emily Hill, you are
the love of my life,

02:12.566 --> 02:15.203
and I wanna spend every day
with you for the rest of mine

02:15.403 --> 02:17.037
until we're old and gray.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.340
Will you marry me?

02:20.441 --> 02:21.442
Yes.

02:22.810 --> 02:23.811
I love you.

02:33.754 --> 02:34.922
Be right back.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.732
Hello?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.339
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

03:27.174 --> 03:28.175
Emily!

03:28.909 --> 03:29.977
Emily!

03:30.578 --> 03:31.912
Emily!

03:35.516 --> 03:36.517
Emily!

03:39.086 --> 03:40.120
Emily!

03:41.722 --> 03:42.723
Emily!

03:57.137 --> 03:58.137
No.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.008
No!

04:16.055 --> 04:17.558
No!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.192
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No!

05:43.210 --> 05:45.345
Hey Richie, do you know
where the extra tape is?

05:47.381 --> 05:48.549
I ain't seen it.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.994
Stop! I promise.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.407
Hi, Mr. Walters.

06:14.675 --> 06:18.579
Sophia, it's official, we're
closed for the New Year.

06:19.179 --> 06:24.017
Whenever you're finished here, just...
lock up behind you.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.729
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

06:25.753 --> 06:28.021
- Okay.
- Okay, oh...

06:28.989 --> 06:31.058
before I forget, the, uh...

06:31.792 --> 06:33.794
Ah, thank you, Mr. Walters.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.465
Sophia, you're doing
a terrific job here.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.732
I thought you should know.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.668
Thank you.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.314
Don't know what I'd do with you.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.071
Thank you, Mr. Walters.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.605
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year to you too.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.376
Bye, Mr. Walters.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.112
Happy New Year.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.089
Oh, no.

06:57.384 --> 06:58.719
Oh, my God.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.621
- That was...
- Oh, man.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.057
Excuse me, have you
seen my brother?

07:04.892 --> 07:05.993
That's him, Charlie.

07:07.394 --> 07:08.394
No.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.842
Will you just take another look?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.783
I already told you,
I haven't seen him.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.801
I mean, what don't
you understand?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.904
We don't need bums like
you pestering people

07:17.037 --> 07:18.138
and disturbing the peace.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.359
I think you should
step back, son.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.345
Hey Taso, ease down, ease down.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.582
What seems to be the problem?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.217
There's no problem.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.752
I was just leaving.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.761
- Morning.
- Morning. Sir, excuse me.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.230
Have you seen my brother?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.265
That's him, Charlie.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.969
Can't say I have, he from here?

07:49.537 --> 07:51.839
No, he was up here proposing
to his girlfriend.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.580
I haven't heard from
either of 'em in ten days.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.968
It's a small town,
shouldn't be hard to find,

07:57.377 --> 08:02.182
but it is New Year's Eve, so
anything's possible, right?

08:02.583 --> 08:04.317
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.498
It's New Year's Eve, baby!

08:18.799 --> 08:21.702
We do gun show, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!
Gun show!

08:21.935 --> 08:24.838
Shots, shots, shots, shots!

08:25.072 --> 08:30.043
Whoa, motherfucker! We do it!
Ba boom, boom, boom.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.645
Bring it, hit me, hit me!
Make it double!

08:32.780 --> 08:34.514
- Booya! Ba boom!
- For sure!

08:34.682 --> 08:36.025
Come on, have some fun with her,

08:36.049 --> 08:37.426
- for once in your life.
- Huh?

08:37.450 --> 08:38.318
Huh, huh?

08:38.451 --> 08:39.820
- Huh, huh?
- Aw.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.264
- Do it!
- No, no, no, no, no,

08:41.288 --> 08:42.799
- I can't do this.
- Put it up, put it up!

08:42.823 --> 08:43.903
Not while I'm on the clock.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.969
- Put it up, put it up!
- Not while I'm on the clock!

08:45.993 --> 08:47.313
Shit, shit.

08:47.427 --> 08:49.507
You guys, shh, just put your...
Put your drinks away.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.535
Michael.

08:55.869 --> 08:56.870
Hey, Sophia.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.405
- Hey!
- Fuck.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.607
Oh no.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.910
Oh no, ladies...
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:03.611 --> 09:08.181
my best friend all the way
from the H-Wood, Michael Bing!

09:08.315 --> 09:10.150
Huh, huh?

09:10.383 --> 09:11.985
Oh man! Good tan, buddy!

09:14.321 --> 09:15.321
Enough slapping.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.033
What, you'd get a tan or what?

09:17.057 --> 09:18.977
Uh, Michael, can I, can I
talk to you in private?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.562
- Yeah.
- Oh shit!

09:22.996 --> 09:24.264
You're in trouble.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.828
What are you doing back here?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.638
Mr. Walters gave me my job back.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.148
'Cause you haven't responded

09:32.172 --> 09:34.875
to a single text message
from me in months.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.244
See, I didn't... I
didn't know what to say.

09:37.377 --> 09:40.447
Oh, so what, now you
just come back here

09:40.580 --> 09:41.849
and we'd get back together?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.982
Is that how you thought
this was all gonna go down?

09:44.417 --> 09:47.120
You know what, too
little, too late.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.892
Put it up.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.894
Oh.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.096
Excuse me.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.406
Hey, everything all right?

09:57.430 --> 09:58.990
Yeah, you know what,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.301
Yeah, you know what,
um, screw it.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.205
I got the keys to the lodge. I
say we party there, you know?

10:05.372 --> 10:07.908
I know I wanna drink, you
certainly wanna drink, so...

10:08.208 --> 10:11.044
Yeah, I mean, I can have Chloe
and Gabe meet us there.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.546
- Who's car we taking?
- No one's driving.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.583
It's New Year's, we
should just be safe.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.686
So, I say we just walk.
The lodge is close.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.764
- I don't think...
- Trail is nearby.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.122
I'm down.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.967
I could certainly use a
breath of fresh air.

10:23.991 --> 10:24.992
Whoa!

10:37.137 --> 10:38.171
It's so crazy.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.808
It's the alcohol, full out
when you're doing squats.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.979
Wild, crazy, shit everywhere,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.715
- I saw it.
- That's disgusting.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.483
I know everything's gonna work
out with you and Michael.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.319
Oh you do, do you?

10:52.619 --> 10:54.788
Yeah, that's why Kyle
and I called him.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.290
You did what?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.960
Yeah, we want you guys
to get back together.

11:00.627 --> 11:02.963
I mean, it's the perfect time
of year for new beginnings.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.798
You can't just
spring this on me.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.434
Look, I know it's
been a rough year,

11:07.667 --> 11:09.202
but a new one's about to start.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.504
Give Michael a second chance.
Come on.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.142
Carry a lot of books, you know,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.378
get my edumacation on.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.580
I need two straps, I
got a lotta books.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.350
Uh, just, you know,
the cool new.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.787
How much farther?

11:27.888 --> 11:31.158
It's uh, it's just
down here, uh.

11:31.624 --> 11:32.960
Are we lost?

11:33.093 --> 11:36.363
No, no, no, we are, we're
getting real close.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.865
We're gettin' real close now.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.499
Okay, Magellan.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.819
What are you doing?

12:33.586 --> 12:34.587
Well.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.257
We are lost!

12:37.524 --> 12:39.126
No, it's just that
all these trails,

12:39.259 --> 12:40.460
they look the same, Chloe.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.072
- God, everyone's waiting for us.
- We're gonna be just fine.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.965
We are going to starve to death.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.399
No, we're fine.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.012
Have you heard about the cougar
problem in these mountains?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.279
- We're gonna be all right.
- I mean,

12:50.303 --> 12:52.105
seriously, did you even
bring signal flares?

12:52.239 --> 12:53.549
- Honey...
- We're gonna starve to death!

12:53.573 --> 12:55.118
- Relax, sweetheart...
- You know how much I hate it

12:55.142 --> 12:57.462
- when you tell me to relax.
- We're gonna get there, okay?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.814
Jeez, you know?

14:08.982 --> 14:11.051
Ah, got a cramp,
little crampy poo.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.886
Whole artery.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.889
Hi!

14:16.423 --> 14:17.424
Hey!

14:18.391 --> 14:22.229
I am so glad you made
it and might I add,

14:22.429 --> 14:24.864
damn, you look hot as hell.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.334
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yup.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.203
I heard she slept with Justin
Anderson and his father

14:30.470 --> 14:31.538
on the same night.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.174
- Doesn't surprise me.
- Guys, this is Tiffani.

14:34.841 --> 14:35.909
With an "I".

14:36.076 --> 14:38.511
With the most beautiful
eyes, might I add?

14:39.446 --> 14:42.082
This is Michael,
Sophia, Vanessa,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.517
Heather, and my dude, Kyle.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.653
Uh, has anybody
else shown up yet?

14:47.054 --> 14:48.755
- No, why?
- Um,

14:48.888 --> 14:51.058
we were just waiting on her
friends, Gabe and Chloe.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.863
All right.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.233
Here, let me help you
out there with that.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.404
Look at this dump, huh?

15:19.319 --> 15:21.888
- You wanted to see me, Sheriff.
- Yeah, that uh...

15:24.257 --> 15:25.925
that big storm is gonna hit us.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.128
I wanna get the word out.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.497
I'll go talk to Walters
and see if we can

15:30.630 --> 15:32.865
set up an area at the hotel
like we did last time.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.367
Copy that.

15:34.501 --> 15:36.261
Now listen, leave the
poachers alone tonight.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.470
You're my only back up,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.015
and I don't have
to rely on county.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.273
On a night like tonight,

15:40.607 --> 15:43.087
there's far worse to deal with,
than checking hunting licenses.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.844
You know people in a storm.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.580
Listen, you head
South on Cold Creek.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.050
I'll head north on Miller Point.

15:50.417 --> 15:51.817
We'll meet some place
in the middle.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.986
Copy that.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.195
Who's ready to get drunk.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.395
- Right!
- Woo!

16:03.596 --> 16:04.840
We gotta get this lady.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.633
- What?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.008
Oh yeah, look at what I found.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.476
Thank you, thank you.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.354
Gotta look good for my
man, you know how...

16:18.378 --> 16:19.618
Did you wear that while hiking?

16:22.149 --> 16:23.216
You want some?

16:24.251 --> 16:26.229
How do you think the old
man would feel about that?

16:26.253 --> 16:27.963
Well, what he doesn't
know won't kill him.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.747
Besides, it's not like
he comes here anymore.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.423
Yeah.

16:31.624 --> 16:32.968
We're gonna give her
a double shot here.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.203
- We gotta get her drunk tonight.
- No!

16:34.227 --> 16:35.262
- No!
- For sure.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.497
- All the way to the top.
- No, you can stop, stop.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.630
No. Oh, my God.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.134
- All right, ladies.
- All right.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.169
To a good night?

16:43.270 --> 16:44.380
- To New Year's Eve.
- Oh, my God.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.473
To not passing out
on me like before.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.874
Agreed.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.879
Hmm.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.583
Yo, have either of you guys
heard from Chloe or Gabe?

16:56.916 --> 16:59.186
No man, you know
what, relax, okay?

16:59.319 --> 17:00.863
They're probably in the woods
like banging somewhere.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.922
Well dude, I just got this
gnarly weather alert.

17:03.056 --> 17:05.492
Actually says we're supposed
to evacuate the whole area.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.859
Oh, you got a weather alert.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.506
Oh man, that sounds
serious, can I see that?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.665
- Yeah.
- Can I, oh, man.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.866
But...

17:14.000 --> 17:15.111
Quit being such a
fucking pussy, man.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.469
Dude, I just got the upgrade.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.137
I'm sorry, man.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.056
Hm.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.259
- Aw man.
- Sophia,

17:39.926 --> 17:41.804
the sheriff's at the door.
What do you wanna do?

17:41.828 --> 17:42.695
Holy shit.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.006
- Hey.
- What are we gonna do?

17:44.030 --> 17:45.550
No, no, no, I'll take
care of it, okay?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.269
Oh, my God, we're all
gonna get fired.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.504
Hey, just calm down, okay?

17:55.542 --> 17:56.976
What are you doing? No.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.745
We're having a good time, girl.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.947
Chill out, if you're
fired, you're fired.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.915
Getting more drunk isn't
going to do anything.

18:03.350 --> 18:04.884
- Drink it.
- Oh, God.

18:09.021 --> 18:12.159
- Sheriff, um, hi.
- Hey.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.495
Hey, didn't wanna
leave you alone.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.897
I saw the lights on.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.675
What are you guys doing up here?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.969
Uh, we're just unwinding.
It's New Year's Eve.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.462
I know it's New
Year's Eve, Sophia,

18:24.737 --> 18:25.981
but have you seen
the weather report?

18:26.005 --> 18:28.675
The storm... Look, you
guys just gotta leave.

18:29.876 --> 18:30.977
- Sheriff...
- Just

18:31.211 --> 18:32.412
do what I say, all right?

18:32.579 --> 18:34.022
Sheriff, please, is
that really necessary?

18:34.046 --> 18:36.283
There's nothing you're doing
that I haven't done before.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.884
Then you'll understand.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.487
I just don't want you making
the same mistakes I made.

18:41.188 --> 18:44.157
The road to hell is paved with
a lot of good intentions.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.460
I'm talking to you as a
friend, not the sheriff.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.129
Get out of this place.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.401
I'm gonna come back tomorrow,
and you better not be here.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.102
- Got it?
- Yeah.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.304
Okay.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.602
So?

21:11.404 --> 21:14.974
So, the sheriff wants
us to leave tonight.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.602
I guess there's some
sort of storm coming in.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.313
So, party's over?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.249
I say we stay.

21:23.983 --> 21:25.151
Guys, I don't know.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.053
If we stay, we have to
be gone by morning.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.822
Come on, is that
really a good idea?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.659
I mean, look, I don't wanna
get in trouble or fired.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.145
You wanna explain to Kyle why
he has to stop drinking?

21:35.562 --> 21:36.863
'Cause I don't.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.666
And besides, Michael's
in the other room.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.134
Chance of a lifetime.

21:44.571 --> 21:46.606
I know, you're probably right.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.877
So... Staying?

21:54.781 --> 21:56.483
- To staying.
- To staying.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.750
You like Michael too?

21:58.084 --> 22:00.853
His eyes, oh, my God, gorgeous.

22:05.291 --> 22:06.891
Yo, damn, where'd
you get that pic?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.162
Yo, Tiffani's outta your
league man, I'm sorry.

22:10.296 --> 22:13.132
Good man, well, hey, uh,
good luck with that, huh?

22:14.934 --> 22:17.704
There he is. Hollywood!

22:18.638 --> 22:19.772
How's it going, man?

22:20.306 --> 22:21.408
It's going, man.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.511
So, you getting back together
with Sophia or what?

22:25.011 --> 22:28.280
- I don't know, it's complicated.
- Hmm, hmm.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.751
Yeah, well, Sophia's changed
a lot since you left.

22:32.919 --> 22:35.121
Yeah, we had to keep a
pretty close eye on her.

22:35.622 --> 22:36.723
What do you mean?

22:40.860 --> 22:43.963
Vanessa told me that one night,

22:44.196 --> 22:46.633
Sophia got drunk and
she disappeared.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.369
Yeah, they found her on
Gabe's porch passed out.

22:50.503 --> 22:53.706
- Did anything happen to her?
- No, she was okay, man, I swear.

22:53.973 --> 22:57.009
I know she's been depressed.
I mean, I...

22:59.311 --> 23:00.747
I just want her to be happy.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.584
Yeah, give it some time, man.

23:05.818 --> 23:06.819
She'll come around.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.757
All right, enough of this.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.926
We need to drink, all right?

23:14.160 --> 23:17.864
I'm proposing a toast to my boy
back from the H-Wood, Michael!

23:18.130 --> 23:19.174
Cheers!

23:19.198 --> 23:20.375
- All right.
- Cheers son.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.735
None for you! All
right, drink up, boys!

23:26.272 --> 23:29.876
New Year's Eve,
motherfuckers, yeah!

23:38.585 --> 23:39.786
Happy New Year.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.054
Oh, oh ladies,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.908
ladies, I'm gonna kiss
you both at midnight.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.224
Wait for me.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.028
Oh, everybody, everybody, can
I have your attention please?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.897
Happy New Year!

23:51.397 --> 23:54.300
I'm so excited to
have you all here,

23:54.467 --> 23:55.735
not like you had a choice

23:55.902 --> 23:57.446
because we are locked in.

23:57.470 --> 24:01.908
It is storming outside, but
it's getting hot inside.

24:02.041 --> 24:06.378
So, everybody gets to kiss
whomever they want tonight

24:06.579 --> 24:11.017
because as of midnight, all
your sins will be absolved.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.520
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

24:14.053 --> 24:16.188
Oh, you're all not drunk enough.

24:16.322 --> 24:19.158
- Can I can an amen?
- Amen!

24:34.473 --> 24:35.508
Ow.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.346
What the... that's not funny.

25:40.339 --> 25:41.608
Sweet!

25:42.308 --> 25:45.211
Now, we have enough players
to actually do this shit.

25:45.411 --> 25:47.513
- Play what?
- Beer pong, baby.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.948
You could be on my team.

25:49.682 --> 25:52.218
Hmm.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.022
I told you, bro.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.166
Listen, you got a better shot
with Heather, all right.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.093
- Okay, she's outta your league.
- Fuck that bitch. Yeah.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.705
Let's take a picture together.

26:02.729 --> 26:05.031
- Uh, I'm okay.
- Please, please, please.

26:05.531 --> 26:07.333
Smile.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.235
Ball, baby, oh.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.498
I think it's time
for another shot.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.475
- Wait, is that rum?
- Mm-hmm.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.578
I don't think so, no,
rum makes me sick.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.247
You'll be fine.

26:21.681 --> 26:24.350
Come on, loosen up,

26:24.516 --> 26:26.953
- have some fun.
- No, I'm fine, thanks sweetie.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.721
I am.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.494
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh, what?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.901
- That bitch.
- What's wrong?

26:42.568 --> 26:45.672
Tiffani with an "I", uploaded
a photo of her and Michael.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.007
Are you kidding me?

26:57.850 --> 26:59.919
Yeah.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.567
- Middle. Calling middle.
- Tip.

27:02.755 --> 27:03.790
We talked about this.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.625
- Excuse me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.128
Michael is off limits.

27:09.261 --> 27:10.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

27:11.063 --> 27:12.941
We're friends on social media
and we took a photo together.

27:12.965 --> 27:13.966
It's not like we fucked.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.377
Well, you'd like
that, wouldn't you?

27:15.401 --> 27:16.521
At least I know what I want.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.304
- Sweet!
- Shut it!

27:19.171 --> 27:20.773
Easy now, shit.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.143
- You okay?
- Shit.

27:24.276 --> 27:27.346
Oh my, damn, snap, girl!

27:31.383 --> 27:32.719
- Go to hell.
- Oh, God...

27:33.786 --> 27:34.854
she's spewing.

27:35.021 --> 27:36.823
- Just.
- She's puking.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.725
Clean it up, here's a ball.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.969
Sheriff Wyatt, this
is Taso, come in.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.843
Concluding perimeter
search of forest.

27:57.309 --> 27:58.544
So far, so good.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.446
Got a whole lot of nothing.

28:11.690 --> 28:12.691
Hey, honey.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.228
Yeah, I'm just finishin' up.

28:16.362 --> 28:19.665
I should be home
in an hour or so.

28:22.869 --> 28:23.870
See you soon.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.087
Oh, God.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.424
Hey!

29:23.195 --> 29:24.263
This yours?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.818
You know you're not
supposed to be out here,

29:28.600 --> 29:29.840
but I'm not gonna write you up.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.770
Big storm coming.

29:32.404 --> 29:35.141
So go on and take your
trophy and head on home.

29:36.708 --> 29:37.908
Do you hear me talking to you?

29:42.214 --> 29:43.249
Mm-hmm.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.554
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm,

29:48.787 --> 29:50.556
- I just wanna go to sleep.
- Okay.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.092
Okay, sit right
here for a second.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.593
Let's get your shoes off.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.163
I'm just gonna...

30:02.434 --> 30:04.336
Okay, come on, let's
get you in bed.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.843
Come on, okay.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.120
Okay, so...

30:22.454 --> 30:23.956
if you can't make
it to the bathroom,

30:24.090 --> 30:25.191
the trashcan is right here.

30:26.092 --> 30:27.126
Okay.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.737
Do you want me to wake up
before the ball drops?

30:29.761 --> 30:31.430
Uh-huh, yeah.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.121
- Oh yeah!
- Here we go, you ready?

30:44.443 --> 30:46.245
I call this... I call
this the hadouken.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.647
Hadouken! Ah, damn it!

30:48.780 --> 30:50.616
I don't know what
that means, dude.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.518
Michael, hurry up, man, come on.

30:53.652 --> 30:55.021
But she really cares about you.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.089
I know she does, I
care about her too.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.091
Then go talk to her,
make this right.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.427
It's just, we're not in
high school anymore.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.730
Yeah, but it's the perfect time.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.799
Charlie!

31:08.167 --> 31:10.369
Some etiquette, you need
some etiquette, dude.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.338
- Watch this.
- Charlie!

31:13.372 --> 31:14.849
- That's probably...
- You guys, quiet, quiet.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.908
Did you hear that?

31:16.075 --> 31:18.244
- Charlie!
- What was that?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.156
Well, hold it, time out,
man, where you going?

31:21.180 --> 31:23.582
- I'm gonna go see who that is.
- No, not without me, man.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.218
Right. Hey, wait
up for me, okay?

31:28.354 --> 31:29.455
Where you guys going?

31:30.322 --> 31:32.034
We're going to check
out the noise outside.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.093
- I heard it too.
- Be careful.

31:36.362 --> 31:39.898
Sweep the leg, dude.
Sweep the fucking leg.

31:42.501 --> 31:43.501
Charlie!

31:45.871 --> 31:46.871
Who is that?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.407
Gabe, is that you?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.742
Hey, hey, what took
you so long, man?

31:51.343 --> 31:52.611
Hey, is Chloe with you?

31:57.083 --> 31:58.284
My name's Travis Crenna.

31:58.517 --> 31:59.877
I'm looking for my
brother Charlie.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.255
Have you seen him?

32:07.226 --> 32:08.466
He's been missing for ten days.

32:10.696 --> 32:11.697
Um.

32:13.232 --> 32:14.233
Uh.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.635
You can go inside and
check with the others.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.605
You, my friend,

32:20.339 --> 32:23.375
look like you could use a drink.
Shit, we all could, right?

32:36.388 --> 32:37.388
Sophia?

33:04.183 --> 33:06.285
- Who is this guy?
- Uh, go man.

33:06.452 --> 33:07.486
Thanks.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.489
- Who are you?
- Travis Crenna.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.859
What the hell are you doing
here, Travis whatever.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.860
I'm looking for my brother
and his girlfriend.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.567
This is him, Charlie, this
is his girlfriend Emily.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.970
- No, man.
- Have any of you seen 'em?

33:25.237 --> 33:26.705
No, sorry.

33:30.609 --> 33:33.379
They've been missing since
just before Christmas.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.299
He told me he was
gonna propose to her.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.015
Just didn't say where.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.793
Well, I don't see how
they would be up here.

33:38.817 --> 33:40.018
This is private property.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.712
Emily posted on her social media
they were going for a hike,

33:42.921 --> 33:44.390
just hours before
they disappeared.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.110
I searched everywhere
else in the area.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.185
This is the only spot
I haven't checked.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.097
This is weird. Who is this guy?

33:52.131 --> 33:53.208
I'm surprised you guys are here.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.234
Um, we all work
in town together.

33:55.934 --> 33:57.803
- Haven't you heard?
- Heard what?

33:58.970 --> 34:00.005
About the murders.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.560
Some of the murders happened
right here in this lodge.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.778
The entire resort
was shut down...

34:08.447 --> 34:09.481
20 years ago,

34:10.149 --> 34:12.109
and they opened it back up
after some time passed.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.559
Uh, I don't know, this is weird.
We were never told about this.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.460
Several employees were
brutally murdered?

34:23.594 --> 34:25.540
Police investigated but the
killers were never found?

34:25.563 --> 34:30.402
Oh, dude, I am way too fucked
up for your little story, man.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.841
- I'm scared.
- Don't you worry, baby.

34:36.041 --> 34:38.177
Richie's here to protect you.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.513
Uh, you know what guys, I'm
gonna go check on Heather.

34:42.648 --> 34:43.681
I'll go with you.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.562
Heather?

34:58.797 --> 34:59.798
You okay?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.335
Maybe we should just let
her sleep it off a bit.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.381
The storm's coming in.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.751
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to find my brother.

35:20.719 --> 35:22.488
You can't go out
there, it's a storm.

35:22.654 --> 35:23.789
He'd do the same for me.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.158
Gonna get yourself killed.

35:26.725 --> 35:28.294
Hey listen, guys,

35:28.494 --> 35:30.629
there's some weird shit
going on out there, okay?

35:30.996 --> 35:32.931
On my way up here, I
walked through a trap,

35:33.465 --> 35:35.100
and a net fell.

35:35.434 --> 35:39.571
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hey, uh, what's your name again?

35:40.439 --> 35:42.274
- Travis.
- Travis.

35:42.408 --> 35:45.777
- Of course, right.
- I'm sorry, man.

35:47.379 --> 35:51.183
Travis, right?

35:52.117 --> 35:54.953
Do me a favor, if
you do come back...

35:55.854 --> 35:57.189
have a better attitude, pal.

35:58.257 --> 36:00.158
You see, I don't know
if you've noticed,

36:00.759 --> 36:02.060
but it's New Year's Eve,

36:02.528 --> 36:06.598
and we are trying to
have a fun time, capish?

36:12.604 --> 36:13.705
Dick.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.977
Oh, yeah. Don't forget
to shut the door

36:19.110 --> 36:21.713
on the way out, all right?
There's a slight breeze.

36:32.991 --> 36:37.028
Sheriff, come in.

36:38.163 --> 36:39.565
Don't be so worried.

36:42.768 --> 36:45.904
I'm not worried, I'm
just being cautious.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.307
- There's a difference.
- Sure is.

36:54.346 --> 36:58.016
You remember that last storm
we had like this one?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.420
- Oh, yeah.
- A lotta people got hurt.

37:02.254 --> 37:05.156
A lot of people went missing for...
for days.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.758
I remember.

37:08.994 --> 37:10.829
Look, I just wanna
shut the town down

37:10.962 --> 37:13.665
and close things
up for 24 hours.

37:14.700 --> 37:16.067
That's, that's smart.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.737
Better safe than sorry,
especially after last one.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.171
Yeah.

37:23.509 --> 37:26.278
You remember my Laurie.

37:26.845 --> 37:27.845
Yeah.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.215
Wonder what she would've done.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.052
She would've kept people safe.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.021
Hey.

37:38.357 --> 37:40.459
How about a short neat
one for the New Year?

37:42.093 --> 37:43.529
No, no, thank you.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.133
Sheriff, even you can
indulge on New Year's Eve.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.771
I don't touch the stuff anymore.

37:56.775 --> 38:00.412
I'm... I'm sorry, that's right, I...
I forgot.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.414
You...

38:03.982 --> 38:05.150
you were quite the wild one.

38:06.217 --> 38:07.217
Yeah.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.388
That was a long time ago.

38:10.622 --> 38:14.159
I got responsibilities now,
people that depend on me.

38:19.197 --> 38:22.167
But I'm gonna... I'm
gonna get going.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.069
I got a long night ahead of me.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.004
Thanks for checking in.

38:33.912 --> 38:34.946
Sheriff.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.383
By the way, I was in town today

38:37.516 --> 38:39.785
when I saw that kid
giving Taso a hard time.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.856
I'm sure with his temper, there
was a fight to break up.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.959
Yeah, you saw that?

38:49.428 --> 38:50.805
Oh, you live in this
town long enough,

38:50.829 --> 38:52.764
you'll see just about anything.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.365
I'm sure you do.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.635
Be careful out there tonight.

38:57.669 --> 38:58.970
You've heard the stories.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.473
I've heard. Goodnight.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.148
Sophia, wait.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.652
Shit.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.687
It's Mr. Walters.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.658
Hello, Mr. Walters?

39:20.158 --> 39:22.127
Sophia, I heard on the news

39:22.260 --> 39:23.795
about the big storm
rolling in tonight,

39:23.929 --> 39:25.497
and I wanted to make
sure you're okay.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.466
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

39:28.767 --> 39:29.868
Good, good.

39:30.969 --> 39:32.370
Well, if you're
worried or scared,

39:32.504 --> 39:33.705
don't hesitate to call.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.742
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to you.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.344
Oh, well, that's very sweet
of you to worry about me.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.713
It seems like only yesterday

39:41.847 --> 39:44.115
you were delivering Girl
Scout Cookies to my house.

39:45.517 --> 39:46.685
I watched you grow up.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.055
Where has the time gone?

39:52.824 --> 39:54.660
Any problems, call
me tonight, okay?

39:55.326 --> 39:56.428
I'll be up late.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.197
You have a wonderful New Year's.

39:59.665 --> 40:00.799
All right, goodnight.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.401
Goodnight.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.543
Do you think we're wrong
for celebrating here?

40:12.243 --> 40:13.411
It's a lodge, Sophia.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.047
It's New Year's, can
you just relax?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.387
Hey Sophia, what is that?

40:22.988 --> 40:23.988
Hmm.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.093
Oh, my God, that's...

40:28.527 --> 40:29.528
It's awesome.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.600
I mean, I was gonna say
disturbing, but, uh...

40:35.634 --> 40:37.769
- Who do you think did that?
- I don't know.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.463
Hello, can anyone hear me?

41:08.634 --> 41:10.836
This is Sheriff Wyatt,
identify yourself.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.104
Travis Crenna.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.273
I found the ranger's truck.

41:15.974 --> 41:16.975
It's abandoned.

41:17.643 --> 41:18.777
Something's wrong here.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.412
Abandoned, what do
you mean abandoned?

41:21.813 --> 41:24.916
Abandoned, as in sitting in the
middle of the road running

41:25.050 --> 41:27.686
and he's not here,
and there's blood.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.021
A lot of blood.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.924
And there's drag marks
and footprints.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.694
It's at the fork on
Pineman's Ridge.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.063
Look, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

41:38.463 --> 41:40.165
You stay put, and
that means stay put.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.853
Taso!

42:09.561 --> 42:10.561
Taso!

42:17.535 --> 42:18.536
Travis!

42:34.519 --> 42:35.587
Great.

42:52.537 --> 42:54.005
Put your hands where
I can see 'em.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.942
It's me, Travis Crenna.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.898
Let me get a second, dawg.

43:42.420 --> 43:43.420
Hey!

43:44.155 --> 43:45.957
I got a little mistletoe.

43:46.591 --> 43:49.861
How 'bout a New Year's Eve kiss.

43:50.061 --> 43:51.963
That's the East
Coast weed, Richie.

43:53.098 --> 43:54.966
Oh, fuck this.

43:55.100 --> 43:58.737
Look, I'm sorry Richie, but
you're just not my type.

43:59.104 --> 44:02.908
Ugh, I think you need to
loosen up a little bit more,

44:03.041 --> 44:07.612
you know? Just... chill
out, I got it, here, here.

44:08.714 --> 44:12.383
I think you need
another cocktail.

44:12.650 --> 44:13.985
Are you trying to get me drunk?

44:14.519 --> 44:17.655
No, I'm just trying to
give you a little drink.

44:17.823 --> 44:19.758
- Oh shit!
- Oh, my God, damn it, Richie!

44:20.191 --> 44:22.293
- I am so...
- You are never gonna get a girl like me

44:22.460 --> 44:23.661
with moves like that.

44:23.962 --> 44:25.296
I got it, I'm sorry.

44:25.764 --> 44:27.365
And besides, that
beard is gross.

44:27.498 --> 44:28.633
What's wrong with the beard?

44:28.767 --> 44:30.044
It looks like something's
growing in there.

44:30.068 --> 44:32.437
It was an accident! Jeez!

44:43.014 --> 44:45.183
I've been waiting
for this all night.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.571
- Give me some more.
- Oh yeah.

45:41.139 --> 45:43.408
- You gonna slap me?
- You like that, you like that?

45:57.455 --> 45:58.790
I need a cigarette.

46:03.494 --> 46:05.430
Time to lose the old beard.

46:14.572 --> 46:16.274
I'm busy in here.

46:16.707 --> 46:17.919
Dude, how much
longer you gonna be.

46:17.943 --> 46:18.943
I need to take a shower.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.912
It's gonna be a little
bit, all right?

46:21.046 --> 46:23.581
Go fucking play with yourself
or something, all right?

46:23.714 --> 46:24.950
Richie's got some work to do.

46:25.583 --> 46:27.085
Just use the other shower.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.020
But that one isn't as good.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.458
Hey, do you have any
rubbers I can borrow?

46:36.461 --> 46:39.965
- Hello, who's in there?
- Oh, it's just me, Tiffani.

46:40.598 --> 46:43.768
The guys, I was doing
a lap dance for them,

46:43.935 --> 46:45.770
they spilled beer
all over my shirt.

46:45.904 --> 46:47.281
I'm just gonna take
a quick shower.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.439
Of course.

46:48.974 --> 46:50.808
All right, honey, you
just clean yourself up.

46:52.077 --> 46:53.644
I will, see you soon.

46:59.784 --> 47:01.586
The fuck? Ugh.

47:38.023 --> 47:40.058
Hello?

47:40.525 --> 47:41.526
Michael?

47:43.962 --> 47:44.996
Hello?

47:55.974 --> 47:56.974
Hello?

48:34.980 --> 48:35.980
Ugh!

48:38.716 --> 48:40.251
I'm sorry about
that, little guy.

48:49.160 --> 48:50.160
Okay.

48:51.229 --> 48:52.297
Okay, we're alone.

48:53.731 --> 48:54.799
Talk to me.

48:59.604 --> 49:00.638
Okay.

49:04.242 --> 49:05.443
Tell me what you're thinking.

49:06.244 --> 49:07.712
I feel like a crazy person.

49:09.514 --> 49:10.881
I thought we had something...

49:13.018 --> 49:14.219
and then you...

49:15.220 --> 49:18.089
just left and went to
California, and...

49:19.790 --> 49:20.925
radio silenced me.

49:21.826 --> 49:23.328
I thought about you every day.

49:28.766 --> 49:31.502
- I thought you forgot about me.
- Sophia.

49:34.305 --> 49:35.340
I've always loved you.

49:50.221 --> 49:51.289
What the hell?

49:57.262 --> 49:58.396
What the hell?

50:07.538 --> 50:09.040
That son of a bitch.

50:10.075 --> 50:11.109
Leave him alone.

50:11.276 --> 50:12.753
He's just out there
looking for his brother.

50:12.777 --> 50:14.279
I told him to leave,
he's out there.

50:14.812 --> 50:16.057
It's New Year's Eve,
just let it go.

50:16.081 --> 50:18.383
Vanessa, relax, I got it, okay?

50:20.918 --> 50:22.720
- Keep it warm.
- Kyle!

50:33.998 --> 50:36.234
- Where are you going?
- That asshole Travis,

50:37.135 --> 50:38.455
he's not gonna ruin
my New Year's.

50:38.836 --> 50:40.538
Can I come? I'm kinda bored.

50:41.139 --> 50:42.240
Yeah sure, whatever.

50:43.841 --> 50:45.841
You can call the paramedics
when I'm done with him.

50:59.924 --> 51:00.925
Over there!

51:11.902 --> 51:13.037
Hey!

51:13.371 --> 51:15.406
- Come on, man, give it up!
- Where are we?

51:15.540 --> 51:17.007
I can't see the lodge anymore.

51:17.975 --> 51:18.975
I don't know.

51:22.513 --> 51:24.048
Kyle, let's go back.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.129
Not until I find this guy.

51:27.084 --> 51:28.653
I swear, I saw him come in here.

51:49.707 --> 51:50.908
Hello?

51:56.947 --> 51:58.015
Somebody live here?

52:03.221 --> 52:04.955
Kyle, I think we should go back.

52:05.590 --> 52:07.692
Ugh, it smells great in here.

52:09.494 --> 52:10.761
The fuck?

52:21.739 --> 52:22.907
What the hell?

52:24.875 --> 52:25.943
We should really leave

52:26.076 --> 52:28.112
before whoever lives
here comes back.

52:28.279 --> 52:29.314
Hell?

52:37.955 --> 52:38.989
Ugh!

52:41.025 --> 52:42.026
Gross.

52:45.430 --> 52:47.798
Tiff, right there.

52:48.566 --> 52:50.046
That's where the noise
is coming from.

52:51.836 --> 52:52.836
Player.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.311
Is this Travis' backpack?

53:02.547 --> 53:03.714
What the hell?

53:10.054 --> 53:11.774
Kyle, I'm serious, this
place is disgusting.

53:11.956 --> 53:13.090
I'm gonna meet you outside.

53:13.391 --> 53:14.392
Yeah, whatever.

53:14.859 --> 53:16.461
Hey, just don't get
eaten by a bear.

53:24.269 --> 53:25.570
Oh, no.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.041
Tiffani?

53:32.176 --> 53:33.177
You okay?

53:37.648 --> 53:38.683
Tiffani?

53:39.884 --> 53:41.018
Shit.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.555
Shit. Tiffani!

53:45.022 --> 53:46.023
Tiffani!

53:46.791 --> 53:47.825
Damn it!

53:54.499 --> 53:56.379
I bet you, this is
where Taso was headed.

53:57.167 --> 53:59.236
I've been by here, it's nasty.

54:01.539 --> 54:03.908
This is Sheriff Wyatt,
does anyone copy?

54:05.209 --> 54:07.645
This is Sheriff Wyatt, if
anyone is listening...

54:09.013 --> 54:13.150
I need backup at
544 Miller Road.

54:13.718 --> 54:14.819
Requesting backup.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.281
No matter what happens,
stay with me, all right?

55:45.710 --> 55:46.711
Gimple?

55:48.646 --> 55:51.148
- In the flesh.
- I thought you were dead.

55:53.150 --> 55:54.351
I might as well be.

55:55.853 --> 55:58.389
What is going on here
and where is Taso?

55:59.089 --> 56:00.357
He's around.

56:04.862 --> 56:05.863
Where's my brother?

56:06.130 --> 56:07.932
Hey, it's not my
fault, it's his.

56:08.132 --> 56:10.401
Gimple, what have you done, man?

56:11.035 --> 56:13.438
It's time to take
responsibility, Wyatt.

56:13.638 --> 56:15.005
Justice is calling.

56:15.673 --> 56:18.609
What you and Taso and
your friends did to us,

56:18.843 --> 56:20.678
me and my brother and sister.

56:21.211 --> 56:24.348
That was no prank,
that was sickening.

56:27.618 --> 56:28.719
We were just kids.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.722
Well, there's more
than one of us.

56:32.056 --> 56:34.391
Angus and Calypso
are still alive,

56:34.659 --> 56:36.160
and we're gonna set straight!

56:36.360 --> 56:39.730
Where's my brother, you freak?

56:39.997 --> 56:41.031
I'll make you talk.

56:42.833 --> 56:45.102
Yeah, look, Taso's
right over there.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.071
You can go ask him
where your brother is.

56:47.237 --> 56:49.173
Go ahead, I got him, all right?

56:49.874 --> 56:52.309
Go ahead, go ahead.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.550
Kill him, Angus, Kill him!

57:01.486 --> 57:02.953
Get him, get him, Angus!

57:37.421 --> 57:39.456
Jesus loves you more than me!

58:54.531 --> 58:55.600
Where's my brother?

59:09.780 --> 59:11.215
Where's my brother?

59:38.676 --> 59:39.744
Sheriff!

59:41.478 --> 59:42.546
Sheriff!

59:42.980 --> 59:44.048
Travis.

59:44.414 --> 59:46.651
Thank God. I heard a gunshot.

59:46.951 --> 59:49.453
Look, I'm locked in here.

59:49.586 --> 59:51.786
Is there any way you can open
the door from the outside?

59:53.290 --> 59:55.592
There's no lock or handle.

59:58.896 --> 01:00:00.297
How about try kicking it in?

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.733
Yeah, stand back.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.077
Gimple's dead, where's Angus?

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.682
It's handled.

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.017
Look, there's one more left.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.030
Do you know where the
Wilson lodge is?

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.756
Yeah, the house where
those kids are staying.

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:27.968
Yeah, I told those kids to
get the hell out of there.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:29.602
You think you can find
your way back there?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:30.828
Yeah, no problem.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:33.097
Look, I'm gonna call for
backup as fast as I can.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:34.431
You get back to the lodge

01:00:34.598 --> 01:00:36.209
and get those fucking kids
out of there, all right?

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.234
Yeah.

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:49.680
Well, I'm glad that's over.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.716
- You're terrible.
- Come, come here.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:55.452
Hey, I don't know what
I'd do without you.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:00:59.023
Maybe we can try and
make things work.

01:01:03.093 --> 01:01:04.328
Is there a generator?

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.330
Yeah, but it's out in the shed.

01:01:06.964 --> 01:01:08.665
- Come on.
- To be continued?

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:09.834
Yeah.

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.503
The power went out.

01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:15.639
Hello!

01:01:16.841 --> 01:01:17.908
Michael!

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.344
Kyle!

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.816
Can someone turn on
the fucking light?

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.857
Not exactly.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:38.162
- Vanessa, Sophia, anyone.
- I'm in my room.

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:40.664
The power's out.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.376
Jesus.

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.581
- Oh.
- I'm right here.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:01.118
- Hey, look...
- The fuck you do to your face?

01:02:01.251 --> 01:02:05.222
I'm just making like a
slight facial alteration

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:06.390
with the cream.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.425
Mm-hmm, so Tiffani
doesn't like beards?

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:09.860
Uh, look, whatever,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.172
just give me like a light
bulb or something, all right?

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:13.030
- I have a candle.
- Okay?

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:14.207
- Yeah, a candle.
- Okay, fine.

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.232
- Fine.
- Would be great.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.000
'Cause I gotta shave, and then
I'm gonna shave my balls,

01:02:18.135 --> 01:02:20.704
and we're gonna have babies
tonight, me and Tiffani,

01:02:20.838 --> 01:02:23.407
like 10,000, in the butt.

01:02:23.707 --> 01:02:25.042
Anal babies, you want one?

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:27.878
- No, I'm good, thank you.
- Why, 'cause he like to felch?

01:02:28.012 --> 01:02:29.613
- Be careful, no.
- Does he gargle it?

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:30.906
Just leave me alone.

01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:32.983
Whatever.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.556
Hey guys!

01:02:40.024 --> 01:02:41.191
We're gonna go out back

01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.765
and see if we can
find the generator.

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:47.865
Wait up!

01:02:51.035 --> 01:02:52.035
Not without me.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.278
Time to do some work.

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:15.926
Follow the leader.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:26.803
That storm is coming in.

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:28.105
Mm-hmm.

01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:31.141
- Where's the generator?
- Uh, oh, there it is.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.221
Well, that'll at least get
us through the night.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.114
- Yeah.
- Till the storm passes.

01:03:41.085 --> 01:03:42.619
This place gives me the creeps.

01:03:43.387 --> 01:03:44.621
Super creepy.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:49.960
♪ And the rockets' red glare ♪

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.367
What the fuck?

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:04.909
Am I trippin'?

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:12.983
Michael, you son of a bitch.

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:14.985
You almost got me.

01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:18.188
That's a nice little Halloween
suit that you put together.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:27.531
Uh, did I do something
to piss you off?

01:04:32.036 --> 01:04:33.070
Shit!

01:04:36.974 --> 01:04:39.043
Oh hey, man, we can
work this out!

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.689
- Nice.
- Ew, is that a brain.

01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.428
We're done, let's go
back to the lodge.

01:04:59.529 --> 01:05:00.630
Jesus!

01:05:01.765 --> 01:05:03.033
Have you guys seen Tiffani?

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.535
Tiffani?

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:10.083
Do you think she would have
come back here on her own?

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:11.208
Tiffani!

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:12.953
I mean, does that sound like
something she would do?

01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:13.977
I don't know.

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:16.289
- Probably fucking Richie.
- Oh, my God.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:17.313
Oh, shit.

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.583
Did we check the gas
gauge on the generator?

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.851
- Is there a gas gauge?
- I don't know.

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:24.421
All right, look, why don't
you guys stay here,

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:25.898
and we'll go check
the gas gauge.

01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.491
Sounds perfect, I'm
gonna have a drink.

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.471
Here, you go.

01:05:45.509 --> 01:05:46.543
What a night.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:49.012
Happy New Year's?

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.281
Happy New Year's.

01:05:58.222 --> 01:05:59.256
The way I see it,

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.957
there's not really
much we can do.

01:06:01.325 --> 01:06:03.827
I mean, Sophia and Michael
are looking for her.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.175
There's no reason why we
can't have a good time.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:12.336
- Yeah, you know what, uh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:13.137 --> 01:06:14.438
I completely agree with you.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.131
- Yeah, she'll be fine, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.143
All right. Round two.

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:26.083
Seriously, I'll have this
guy, I swear to God.

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:29.153
Kyle, Kyle, don't.

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:34.891
Okay, no, I need to handle this.

01:06:35.192 --> 01:06:37.227
- Hey!
- Kyle, Kyle, don't.

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:42.299
Where'd that bastard go?

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:03.687
Oh, God. No!

01:07:04.288 --> 01:07:06.656
- Vanessa, run!
- Oh, God!

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.225
Baby, run!

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:48.498
What is that?

01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:56.373
Please, please, I'm begging you!
Please!

01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:59.843
Help, help, help, help!

01:08:00.043 --> 01:08:01.445
Please, please.

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:06.283
Help, help! You don't
have to do this.

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:08.452
Please, just leave me alone.

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.257
No, no.

01:08:28.372 --> 01:08:29.606
Just find something.

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:33.143
This will work.

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:48.625
Vanessa!

01:08:50.227 --> 01:08:52.296
- Heather!
- Tiffani?

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.106
Fuck.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:10.279
Come on.

01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:19.488
- What is that?
- What the fuck?

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.880
Oh, run, run! Run.

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:51.388
Oh, my God, Heather?

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.859
- Travis!
- Wait, it's not what you think.

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.933
I came back to warn you.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.305
Stop! Listen!

01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:38.715
Please let me go!

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:16.152
Happy New Year, son.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:20.590
I got you something special,
all sorts of goodies,

01:14:21.257 --> 01:14:24.961
including your favorite,
chocolate chip muffin.

01:14:50.453 --> 01:14:51.555
I'll make you a deal.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:57.393
I'll take off the gag if
you promise not to scream.

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:01.330
It would serve no purpose
and no one would hear you,

01:15:01.464 --> 01:15:02.999
we're so high in the mountains.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:06.636
Okay?

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.175
Angus.

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:25.822
Get the others, son.

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:35.164
Why, Mr. Walters, why?

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:42.138
Hold that thought.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:17.906
Tiffani?

01:17:20.003 --> 01:17:21.637
Fuck.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.112
- Sophia!
- Michael!

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:31.419
Don't touch her, you freaks.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.418
Get away from me,
you crazy bitch!

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.087
Oh fuck!

01:17:39.288 --> 01:17:40.589
Thank you, Calypso.

01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:47.296
Welcome.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.299
We're all assembled.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:52.468
Oh, please, please.

01:17:53.302 --> 01:17:55.038
Sophia, of course you
remember Tiffani.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:57.240
Uh, this is Emily Hill.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:59.909
I was feeling a bit
of a festive mood,

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:02.846
so I gave her fiancé the
keys to the property and...

01:18:05.048 --> 01:18:06.482
he's dead now.

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:10.219
You dropped this.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:13.589
You should be more careful
with your possessions.

01:18:14.157 --> 01:18:16.893
Sophia, if you would be so kind.

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:20.496
Thank you.

01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:24.567
This is a 15-minute hourglass.

01:18:24.834 --> 01:18:26.635
That's how long this
conversation will take

01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:29.338
and that's precisely
how much time you have

01:18:29.472 --> 01:18:31.307
to finish that entire
bottle of whiskey.

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:33.309
Please note...

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:36.712
that it's minutes to midnight.

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:43.486
But there's no way that
I can finish all this.

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:46.022
- No.
- I'll die.

01:18:46.990 --> 01:18:49.592
Sophia, uh, one
of them will die.

01:18:54.163 --> 01:18:55.531
You could save their lives.

01:18:57.366 --> 01:18:58.768
You've got 15 minutes.

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:14.550
Sophia!

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:25.962
Drink, Sophia.

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:31.434
It's a continued resolution
that I renew every year

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:34.303
to dispose of the
young filth that...

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:37.106
contaminates our community.

01:19:37.506 --> 01:19:39.208
Sophia, you're not the sweet

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:42.711
and innocent girl
that I once knew.

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:49.652
But you're all the same,
reckless and irresponsible,

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:52.922
just like those degenerates
who picked on my kids.

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:55.058
Laurie would be ashamed.

01:19:57.693 --> 01:19:59.162
Do you know how my wife died?

01:19:59.562 --> 01:20:00.763
It was New Year's Eve.

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.432
Wyatt, Taso and a bunch
of their drunk friends

01:20:03.566 --> 01:20:05.869
chased my kids into a
condemned building.

01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:08.137
Laurie went in to protect them.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.606
The building collapsed
on her and killed her.

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:15.544
Angus, Calypso, and
Gimple were innocent.

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.680
Everyone thought
they were killed.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:20.683
Drink it!

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:29.458
Time is almost up.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:35.631
Angus, show them.

01:20:38.634 --> 01:20:41.704
It's okay, son. Go ahead.

01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:58.454
They were continuously ridiculed
and picked on for their looks.

01:21:06.829 --> 01:21:08.597
You're not doing
very well, Sophia.

01:21:22.478 --> 01:21:24.880
Time's up.

01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:29.452
Who's it gonna be, Sophia?

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:34.523
Please don't do this,
don't make me choose.

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:37.193
You choose or I will.

01:21:37.526 --> 01:21:40.596
- No.
- Why don't we let Angus decide.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.377
She doesn't deserve to die.

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:00.583
Last words?

01:22:09.292 --> 01:22:11.427
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:31.614
Who's next.

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:50.633
Pick me.

01:22:54.437 --> 01:22:56.105
That's very honorable of you.

01:23:16.592 --> 01:23:18.794
Hey!

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:50.119
The fuck!

01:25:48.411 --> 01:25:50.579
You sick son of a bitch.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:04.126
Sophia!

01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:23.045
Okay.

01:26:25.314 --> 01:26:26.549
Charlie?

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:41.096
Let's go, the sheriff
is on his way.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:49.356
Hey guys, guys.

01:26:51.474 --> 01:26:52.541
No.

01:26:59.482 --> 01:27:00.583
Sophia.

01:27:06.322 --> 01:27:07.723
Thought I'd lost you.

01:27:08.657 --> 01:27:09.658
Oh, Michael.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:11.727
Hey.

01:27:15.364 --> 01:27:16.432
Travis!

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:18.534
Almost here, come on.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.274
Where's Angus?

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:38.554
Right side's clear, Sheriff.

01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:40.489
Left side clear.

01:27:41.624 --> 01:27:42.958
Come on guys, you're safe to go.

01:28:18.561 --> 01:28:19.662
Sheriff.

01:28:20.396 --> 01:28:21.630
Sheriff!
