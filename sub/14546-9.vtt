00:01.001 --> 00:02.919
Eek.

00:02.961 --> 00:04.170
Ugh.

00:04.212 --> 00:05.588
Okay, you can go ahead
and rinse.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.465
I've seen all
I need to see here.

00:07.507 --> 00:08.758
Your wisdom teeth.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.218
Those puppies need to come out.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.594
But they don't hurt.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.013
It's preventative.

00:13.054 --> 00:15.015
So then wouldn't that be
like amputating your arm

00:15.056 --> 00:17.434
so that you don't
break it one day?

00:17.475 --> 00:18.476
Who sent you here?

00:18.518 --> 00:19.561
Give me one good reason

00:19.602 --> 00:21.062
to pull four teeth!

00:21.104 --> 00:23.732
Tessa, your dad
asked me to assess

00:23.773 --> 00:26.609
whether or not your wisdom
teeth needed to come out.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.487
I'm assessing that they do.
Now rinse.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.573
Well, I don't really need
to rinse after an assessment.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.034
You will rinse, and when
I say rinse, you rinse!

00:34.075 --> 00:35.493
(female #1)
'Okay, let's see.'

00:35.535 --> 00:37.704
We can get you in
tomorrow morning

00:37.746 --> 00:39.205
on junior secretary's day.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.331
Oh, darn.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.583
I had really big plans

00:41.624 --> 00:43.376
for junior secretary's day.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.795
Just because we do
sub-secretarial work

00:45.837 --> 00:47.464
doesn't mean we're subhuman.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.340
You'll have your day
tomorrow, Greta.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.884
Stand down.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.677
Here's your reminder card, hon.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.845
We will see you tomorrow.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.513
You may see me tomorrow

00:55.555 --> 00:57.766
if I decide to have the surgery
which I haven't yet.

00:57.807 --> 00:59.476
Okay.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.186
Bye, Greta.

01:01.227 --> 01:05.065
And now, salesman of the year
for a record five years running

01:05.106 --> 01:08.151
the one, the only,
the killer in khakis.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.445
Fred Sha-a-ay!

01:10.487 --> 01:11.529
Whoo!

01:11.571 --> 01:13.573
Whoo! Mm! Mm!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.492
Well, gang,
I am off to beautiful

01:15.533 --> 01:17.660
sunny Cranston, Rhode Island.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.912
I don't know why
they even bother

01:18.953 --> 01:20.246
with this contest anymore.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.874
They just end up
sending you every darn year.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.126
Well, I'll be back Thursday.
Group hug.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.711
- Aw. Mmm.
- Mmm.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.255
Oh, yeah. That's the stuff. Mm!

01:29.297 --> 01:32.967
Lisa, you may wanna consider
using a stronger deodorant.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.636
(Tessa)
When something
is painfully boring

01:34.677 --> 01:36.429
people say
it's like pulling teeth.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.598
To determine the subject
of tomorrow's

01:38.640 --> 01:41.059
in-class essay, each pupil will

01:41.101 --> 01:42.727
'have a chance to take a spin'

01:42.769 --> 01:47.190
on the thrilling,
say it with me, wheel of..

01:47.232 --> 01:48.483
Topics!

01:48.525 --> 01:49.859
Oral surgery might

01:49.901 --> 01:50.944
be a nice alternative

01:50.985 --> 01:52.362
to whatever in-class essay

01:52.403 --> 01:54.072
the wheel of topics
would bring.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.158
Tessa Altman, come on down!

02:01.788 --> 02:03.164
Not medieval armor and weapons.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.125
Please, not medieval armor
and weapons.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.796
- Yes.
- Oh!

02:09.838 --> 02:12.924
Look at that!
"Eleanor of Aquitaine!"

02:12.966 --> 02:14.801
"You're welcome"

02:14.843 --> 02:16.136
quoth the wheel.

02:16.177 --> 02:17.679
Well, here's the thing,
Mr. Simpkin.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.305
I'm gonna be out of school
tomorrow due to some

02:19.347 --> 02:20.890
emergency oral surgery

02:20.932 --> 02:22.976
I just decided I'm having

02:23.017 --> 02:26.813
so Eleanor of Aquitaine..

02:26.855 --> 02:28.356
...uh, she might
just have to wait.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.649
Oh.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.818
- 'It's us.'
- 'I see that.'

02:31.860 --> 02:33.236
We were sitting on the couch.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.654
I remember.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.489
Exactly as we are right now.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.366
Well, our love of sitting on

02:38.408 --> 02:40.910
couches has been immortalized.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.246
- I love it.
- I hope I'm not rushing things.

02:43.288 --> 02:45.915
But I was just hoping we were
at the point of joint decor.

02:45.957 --> 02:49.169
- Is that French for no return?
- No, silly.

02:49.210 --> 02:51.379
It just means the point where we
can start leaving things

02:51.421 --> 02:52.463
at each other's places.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.506
Ah.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.008
Unless you don't feel like

02:55.049 --> 02:56.718
we're ready for joint decor.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.219
No, we absolutely are.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.013
In fact, I have
a funky old washcloth

03:00.054 --> 03:02.098
I was hoping to leave
in your guest bath.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.808
See, you're teasing,
but I'm trying

03:03.850 --> 03:06.019
to take all this here
to the next level.

03:06.060 --> 03:09.063
Oh. Well,
thank you, sweetheart.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.983
I will put it
in a place of honor. Ahem.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.276
Do you have to be somewhere?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.486
Oh, no, sorry. I-I'm just..

03:15.528 --> 03:17.488
I'm bracing myself
for an argument with Tessa.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.282
She's supposed to get her
wisdom teeth out tomorrow.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.326
But Noah says she's refusing.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.369
She says it's unnecessary.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.205
Initially, Dalia said
the same thing

03:25.246 --> 03:27.916
about collagen treatments,
but I got her to come around.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.542
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Tessa.

03:29.584 --> 03:30.877
Good luck getting
your wisdom teeth out

03:30.919 --> 03:32.754
tomorrow, girl.
I'll bring you a milkshake.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.297
Sounds good.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.424
Told you she'd come around.

The guys pushing those

Have you brought vermin
into Chatswin?

It's-it's okay. Don't worry.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.745
I've already set
some humane traps.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.956
[scoffs]
Humane traps?

04:49.998 --> 04:52.542
Rats laugh
at humane traps, George.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.919
And the only way
to silence their laughter

04:54.961 --> 04:56.045
poison gas.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.547
Poison gas? Okay.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.215
I-I won't be using
poison gas.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.176
Don't go all wobbly
on me now, George.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.345
I recently purchased
a case of rat bombs

05:04.387 --> 05:06.431
from Australia on eBay.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.391
Technically, they're
illegal here

05:08.433 --> 05:09.851
but they can take out
a full-grown wallaby

05:09.892 --> 05:11.853
in under 30 seconds.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.021

05:13.062 --> 05:14.647
Thank you, Sheila,
but no, thank you.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.357
Really. I got this.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.650
I hope so, George

05:17.692 --> 05:19.652
because I will be following up.

This is how the black plague
started! More or less!

05:23.656 --> 05:25.783

George had a more pressing

general anesthesia.

05:40.256 --> 05:41.924
I love you.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.223
Did anybody follow you here?

05:49.265 --> 05:51.601
What? What is she
talking about?

05:51.642 --> 05:53.936
Dad, I'm talking about

05:53.978 --> 05:55.813
the wisdom teeth
conspiracy thing.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.192
And I'm not even talking
about our government.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.904
I'm talking about...theirs.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.198
Okay, Tessa, sweetheart,
you're drooling blood.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.575
Is this reaction
to the medication normal?

06:07.617 --> 06:09.619
You know, not really.

06:09.660 --> 06:13.122
Uh, I, you know, I'm 80% certain
that she's gonna be okay.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.541
Really? 80%? That's very
reassuring. Thank you.

Mm? Come on.

Ask yourself, George.

What is the one thing
that we have

06:36.521 --> 06:38.481
that they don't have?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.359
Teeth.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.777
Teeth!

06:42.819 --> 06:44.529
Have you ever seen
an alien with teeth?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.865
Well, the alien in the movie
"Alien" had huge teeth.

06:47.907 --> 06:51.411
No, I'm talking
about real aliens.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.913
Not Hollywood aliens.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.124
- The real guys.
- Right.

What are you doing
in my basement

07:31.451 --> 07:33.494

07:33.536 --> 07:36.164
I'm hiding out from Sheila
for a couple of days.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.999
Okay. And what's
with the getup?

07:38.040 --> 07:40.835
Well, as you know, Sheila and I
share a psychic connection.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.463
She's not unlike
the all-seeing Eye of Sauron.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.840
This leaden apron prevents her
from peering into my soul

07:45.882 --> 07:48.092
and the foil crown
scrambles my brain waves

07:48.134 --> 07:51.512
thus retarding Sheila's ability
to read my thoughts.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.139
Okay, you need to get out
of my basement.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.932
I can't!

07:57.602 --> 07:59.061
Winning the salesman-of-the-year
award

07:59.103 --> 08:01.856
is the only thing I do
that she's proud of.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.649
And this year you didn't win?

08:03.691 --> 08:05.818
Oh, the shame, George,
the shame.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.278
Fred, she's your wife.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.821
She loves you.
She'll understand.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.199
Just, just tell her the truth.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.869
Listen to me, George.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.497
At home, Sheila might enjoy
a nice house cat

08:17.538 --> 08:20.666
to stroke and fondle
and feed from her hand.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.335
But out there in the world,
she expects me

08:22.376 --> 08:25.379
to be a lion,
red of tooth and claw!

08:25.421 --> 08:28.841
Honestly, George,
my nerves are shot!

08:28.883 --> 08:30.593
All I've had to eat today
is a can of beans

08:30.635 --> 08:32.595
and a few handfuls of gorp.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.515
Mmm.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.225
Please don't tell Sheila
I'm eating carob.

08:37.266 --> 08:39.227
She thinks it's for liberals.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.314
What's that?

08:43.356 --> 08:44.774
This is Tessa's homework

08:44.815 --> 08:46.651
and your opportunity
to be alone with her.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.403
And as you can see,
I've organized it into folders

08:49.445 --> 08:52.281
and marked it for handy
reference with color-coded tabs.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.783
Yeah, I-I don't think
Tessa wants me

08:53.824 --> 08:55.618

08:55.660 --> 08:57.912
...in the biblical sense.

08:57.954 --> 09:01.457
Ever since we
made out on Christmas..

09:01.499 --> 09:04.293
...I've been giving her some
space and she's been taking it.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.462
This is your chance
to sweep Tessa off her feet.

09:06.504 --> 09:07.838
Just imagine it.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.131
Poor, sick Tessa

09:09.173 --> 09:11.592
home alone,
vulnerable in her bed

09:11.634 --> 09:13.386
and you stroll in carrying

09:13.427 --> 09:14.804
all of this amazing homework

09:14.845 --> 09:17.682
and Tessa, overcome,
with trembling hands

09:17.723 --> 09:20.226
bestows upon you
the ultimate reward and--

09:20.268 --> 09:22.228
Touches me where
the bathing suit covers!

09:22.270 --> 09:24.105
God! No. No!

09:24.146 --> 09:25.940
Why were her hands trembling?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.358
From gratefulness.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.111
Oh. Right. Gratefulness.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.320
[bell ringing]

09:33.531 --> 09:36.492
[gulping]

09:43.249 --> 09:44.834
Young lady, are you sure

09:44.875 --> 09:46.460
that much juice is a good idea?

09:46.502 --> 09:48.504
You'll rot your teeth.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.507
Stay away from me.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.384
I know exactly why you're here.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.011
Look, I'm not proud
of what I'm doing

09:55.052 --> 09:56.304
but it's for the best.
Trust me.

09:56.345 --> 09:58.264
I don't trust you!

09:58.306 --> 10:01.267
Just wait until my father
finds out you've landed.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.810
He knows I've landed,
and he's given me

10:02.852 --> 10:05.104
his blessing to be here!

10:05.146 --> 10:08.274
What's this?
You've captured their souls?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.984
I won't let you
get away with this!

10:10.026 --> 10:11.944
I am already
getting away with this!

10:11.986 --> 10:13.321
So you just
keep your mouth shut!

10:13.362 --> 10:14.697
Oh, I'll keep it shut!

10:14.739 --> 10:15.948
I'll keep it shut, alright!

10:15.990 --> 10:17.283
You'll never get my teeth!

10:17.325 --> 10:18.492
Oh, yes, I will!

10:18.534 --> 10:20.286
Wait. What?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.876
Whoa! Okay.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.045
Did you do it, George?
Did you catch a rat?

10:29.086 --> 10:32.506
Oh. Um...yep.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.550
Caught him in a humane trap.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.552
And then I killed him.
So he's, he's dead now.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.762
I gotta go.
I'll-I'll see you later.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.556
Several years ago, George

10:40.598 --> 10:42.933
I chaperoned a coed
overnight field trip.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.936
In preparation for that event

10:45.978 --> 10:48.981
I memorized the FBI
interrogation manual.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.359
- Naturally.
- You're flinchy, George.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.902
- What?
- You're flinchy.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.695
And you're displaying
all the telltale characteristics

10:54.737 --> 10:56.280
of a liar.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.658
You're avoiding eye contact,
you're stammering

10:58.699 --> 10:59.992
and you're using
your grocery bags

11:00.034 --> 11:01.619
as a physical barrier
between us.

11:01.661 --> 11:04.372
Uh, o-o-okay, this is crazy.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.999
I-I-I'm gonna go inside now.
Okay? Bye.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.668
Just remember, George.

11:08.709 --> 11:10.419
If you're harboring a rat

11:10.461 --> 11:12.296
that makes you a rat.

11:15.883 --> 11:17.760
Knock, knock,
Dr. Werner here

11:17.802 --> 11:20.680
for a little post-op check-in.
Oh, boy.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.223
They've come for me.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.767
They know I know.

11:24.809 --> 11:26.560
But I'm glad you're here to see
this because you'll understand

11:26.602 --> 11:27.770
the facts more than anybody.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.147
1951, water fluoridation

11:30.189 --> 11:31.941
becomes official US policy.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.276
Hmm!
That sounds familiar, Tessa!

11:34.318 --> 11:36.821
Oh, yeah. 'Cause 51
is also in "Area 51."

11:36.862 --> 11:39.240
Break that down further,
five plus one equals six!

11:39.281 --> 11:40.783
Six, the number of legs
on an insect

11:40.825 --> 11:42.451
the number of points
on the star of David

11:42.493 --> 11:44.995
the number of strings
on a standard guitar

11:45.037 --> 11:46.831
the number of cans
in a six-pack

11:46.872 --> 11:49.667
and the number of flags
at a theme park!

11:49.709 --> 11:51.293
Oh, yeah!

11:51.335 --> 11:54.672
When printed
three times in a row..

11:54.714 --> 11:57.425
...it's the number of the beast.

11:59.176 --> 12:00.177
I..

12:00.219 --> 12:01.721
I think it's..

12:01.762 --> 12:03.723
...time to start
tapering off of these.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.393
Uh..

12:07.435 --> 12:09.729
- Sheila knows.
- Fred, she doesn't know.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.856
But you're not supposed to be up
here. Get back in the basement.

12:11.897 --> 12:12.898
[knocking on door]

12:12.940 --> 12:14.525
[gasps]
Meine fraulein!

12:14.567 --> 12:16.402
Shh!

12:16.444 --> 12:18.946
Okay, no. No. It's, it's
not yours.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.448
Go downstairs and stay cool.

12:20.489 --> 12:21.490
Okay.

12:22.658 --> 12:23.951
- Hey.
- Hi, daddy.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.244
Here's that shake
I promised Tessa.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.579
Can I come see the patient?

12:26.620 --> 12:28.539
You know what?
Now's not really a good time.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.582
What? Why not?

12:29.623 --> 12:30.666
Well, I-I'm-I'm just

12:30.708 --> 12:31.959
a little preoccupied

12:32.001 --> 12:33.252
and I think Tessa
may be resting.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.920
So we'll talk later, okay?

12:34.962 --> 12:37.465
- Well, I..
- Oh. Thanks for the milkshake.

12:37.506 --> 12:40.259
[instrumental music]

12:57.276 --> 13:00.571
I know I'm in your way,
George, and I'm sorry.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.948
But that was a close call today.
I need to lay low.

13:02.990 --> 13:05.743
Fred, I can't
keep doing this.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.703
I lied to Sheila,
I was rude to Dallas

13:07.745 --> 13:09.413
and I've got a kid
upstairs that--

13:09.455 --> 13:12.333
Who doesn't need you like I do,
George! Not like I do!

13:12.374 --> 13:13.542
[honking]

13:13.584 --> 13:15.753
Oh, no.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.463
- What?
- Oh, no.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.716
Oh, God!
No, please, Lord!

13:20.758 --> 13:22.134
What is going on?

13:22.176 --> 13:24.094
How could I have been so stupid?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.262
The office thinks I'm home sick!

13:25.304 --> 13:27.264
It's junior secretary's day!

13:27.306 --> 13:29.308
Junior what, now?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.647
It's junior secretary's
day, George.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.774
I'm a junior secretary.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.776
I'm not the salesman
of the year.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.320
They were gonna let me go,
but I convinced them to keep me.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.447
Junior secretary
was the only opening they had

13:43.489 --> 13:46.200
so I took it, George.
I took it right in the pants!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.369
Oh. So you're
a junior secretary?

13:48.410 --> 13:51.539
Yeah, I get the coffee for
the lady who gets the coffee.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.582
If Sheila finds out,
my marriage is over.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.251
I'll have to live
in your basement permanently.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.378
Which is why you
have to go across the street

13:57.419 --> 13:59.421
and steal that basket
so Sheila doesn't find out

13:59.463 --> 14:00.881
about my secretarial work

14:00.923 --> 14:01.924
and I don't
have to live underground

14:01.966 --> 14:03.634
like a Chilean miner!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.261
[sighs]

14:05.302 --> 14:07.346
Now can I get you a coffee?

14:12.309 --> 14:13.811
Only in Chatswin
was junior secretary's day

14:13.853 --> 14:15.688
an occasion that warranted
gift baskets

14:15.729 --> 14:19.275
balloon towers, and limos
full of junior secretaries.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.651
[all cheering]

14:20.693 --> 14:26.365
JSD, 2013, bitches!

14:26.407 --> 14:28.033
[women screaming]

14:32.413 --> 14:33.622
No!

14:34.665 --> 14:36.250
Damn it!

14:43.090 --> 14:44.675
- Oh.
- Hey, Ryan.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.802
Mr. Altman. What up?

14:46.844 --> 14:48.721
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.264
I was just, I was just, um,
I was just looking

14:50.306 --> 14:52.391
for the get-well basket
that I ordered for Tessa.

14:52.433 --> 14:54.018
And wouldn't you know it,
they delivered the darn thing

14:54.059 --> 14:56.687
to the wrong address.
Oh, there it is.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.856
Oh, uh, looks like they got

14:58.898 --> 15:00.316
the "Get well" part wrong, too.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.942
- Uh..
- Bummer. Yeah.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.945
I was just gonna bring Tessa
her homework as a friend.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.989
Not as someone who's, like,
hypnotized by the play

15:07.031 --> 15:10.075
of sunlight on her coppery hair
or anything.

15:10.117 --> 15:12.578
Right. Well, of course not.
I'm sure she'll be grateful.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.080
That's all I want, actually,
is-is her gratefulness.

15:15.122 --> 15:18.125
Well, I'm just gonna
pop into your house

15:18.167 --> 15:20.419
and grab that basket,
which is mine anyway.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.379
I'm just gonna pop over
to your house and grab nothing.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.298
Uh, just gonna deliver

15:24.340 --> 15:26.383
these papers
to your daughter is all.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.260
Nothing else.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.319
Be back in 30 minutes
for dinner, Ryan!

15:45.361 --> 15:46.946
'I just came back
from my riding lesson.'

15:46.987 --> 15:48.489
'Uh, starving!'

15:58.707 --> 16:00.960
[sniffing]

16:01.001 --> 16:03.963
'Fred must have
funked up his fleece again.'

16:04.880 --> 16:06.090
[sighs]

16:15.432 --> 16:16.934
[creaking]

16:22.231 --> 16:24.274
[whispering]
I'm not stealing.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.276
[whispering]
I don't care.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.364
I was finally
off the pain killers

16:30.406 --> 16:31.615
and back to my old self.

16:31.657 --> 16:32.658
But my old self

16:32.700 --> 16:34.243
was in a lot of pain.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.537
Fortunately,
Ryan had a solution.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.248
There.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.500
That's what I did when I got
mouth-checked in lacrosse.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.210
Oh, my God.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.838
Ryan, thank you so much.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.631
That feels so much better.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.216
You look like a bunny.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.093
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.846
By the way, your socks
smell a lot better than mine.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.389
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.474
- I wash 'em.
- Mm.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.770
You mouth-checked me, too,
you know..

17:01.812 --> 17:03.897
...on Christmas.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.900
Ever since you
slammed your tongue into mine

17:06.942 --> 17:09.236
I've been thinking about
what it meant to you

17:09.278 --> 17:10.696
if anything.

17:10.738 --> 17:13.657
It meant something.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.535
But what?

17:16.577 --> 17:19.204
I don't know.
We tried it before.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.666
And...we're total opposites.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.669
That's great, because opposites
don't push each other apart.

17:25.711 --> 17:28.630
They-they-they do
the other thing.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.132
They attract, Ryan.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.801
Opposites...attract.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.763
I'm super attracted to you
even right now.

17:35.804 --> 17:38.432
Your face is puffy,
and your gums are bloody

17:38.474 --> 17:40.434
and your lips are dry
and lusterless.

17:40.476 --> 17:41.810
Ow.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.938
That must mean
something, right?

17:44.980 --> 17:46.899
Don't make me smile.
It hurts.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.485
See? I make you smile
even when it hurts to smile.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.655
Maybe that means something, too.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.450
Ow.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.369
[instrumental music]

18:04.124 --> 18:05.334
Mission accomplished.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.045
- Your secret is safe.
- Oh! Mm.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.797
Thank you, George. Mwah.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.965
- Okay. Okay.
- Thank you. Thank you.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.510
Okay. That's enough, Fred.
You're welcome.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.053
Ooh, ooh,
at least partake in

18:16.095 --> 18:17.846
some delicious
smokehouse almonds.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.223
They're my favorite,
and you earned them.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.100
- I'm gonna go check on my kid.
- Fair enough.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.560
But I can't promise
these will wait for you! Ha ha.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.564
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.274
Certainly didn't mean
to startle you.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.277
Really? 'Cause...
kind of seems like you did.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.696
It's just...
the door was unlocked

18:34.738 --> 18:36.448
and as neighbors,
we're welcome to traipse

18:36.490 --> 18:40.452
in and out of each other's
homes, aren't we, George?

18:40.494 --> 18:41.703
I thought so.

18:41.745 --> 18:45.249
I trust you, George.
I really do.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.879
And I know you would
never lie to me.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.548
Of course not.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.342
So when you told me
you had handled

18:55.384 --> 18:59.263
the problem in the basement,
I took you at your word.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.889
[chuckles]

19:00.931 --> 19:02.224
Still..

19:02.266 --> 19:04.810
...I just can't shake

19:04.852 --> 19:07.896
the feeling that maybe

19:07.938 --> 19:10.983
just maybe, the problem..

19:11.024 --> 19:12.734
...persists.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.319
And if so..

19:14.361 --> 19:16.697
...then perhaps
it's time to use..

19:17.489 --> 19:18.657
...the gas.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.534
(George)
"G'die, mate?"

19:20.576 --> 19:22.161
Sheila, no! He won't survive!

19:22.202 --> 19:23.203
[honking]

19:24.246 --> 19:27.082
- 'Fred!'
- Fred?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.418
That my wife you got there?
I'm gonna need her back.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.838
'Cause I took an early flight
home just to see her.

19:32.880 --> 19:33.881
Hi.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.969
Mmm!

19:39.011 --> 19:42.931
Well, don't you look handsome
in your riding gear?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.349
I know one pony
that needs a ride.

19:44.391 --> 19:48.312
- Well...get in the house.
- Mmm.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.106
What makes a good couple
work is..

19:51.148 --> 19:52.941
...a complete mystery.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.860
I really like him.

19:54.902 --> 19:58.030
[sighs]
But we just don't
make sense on paper.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.365
Well, I'm not sure
I'm the one to be doling out

20:00.407 --> 20:02.034
relationship advice
at the moment.

20:02.075 --> 20:04.578
You see, I mistakenly thought
your daddy and I

20:04.620 --> 20:06.496
had entered
the joint decor stage--

20:06.538 --> 20:10.292
Hey. Where did you find this?

20:10.334 --> 20:13.587
I found that discarded like
a piece of trash in your trash.

20:13.629 --> 20:17.382
Are you kidding? George has been
looking everywhere for this.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.593
What? Well, then why, pray tell,
would he throw it away?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.637
It's not trash.
It's joint decor.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.223
No, he didn't throw it away,
Dallas. I did.

20:24.264 --> 20:27.392
I-I thought it was
from outer space.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.519
It's been a really weird day.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.814
Oh. Oh!

20:32.856 --> 20:35.442
So this is all your fault.

20:35.484 --> 20:38.111
[sighs]
That makes me feel
so much better.

20:38.153 --> 20:41.990
- At least one of us does.
- Right.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.035
Look, Tessa, I know it isn't
easy and believe me

20:45.077 --> 20:47.704
there's no odder couple
than me and your dad.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.582
But sometimes there's more
to life than what makes

20:50.624 --> 20:52.417
sense on paper.

20:53.710 --> 20:56.004
- Thanks, Dallas.
- Sure thing.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.548
And sorry I hijacked the earlier
part of the conversation

20:58.590 --> 21:01.093
to be about my love life.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.887
But seriously, you think
he's super into me, right?

21:07.557 --> 21:10.102
Ah! It feels good
to be home.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.571
- Goodnight, Sheila.
- Night, Fred.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.198
- Oh, and, Fred..
- Hmm?

21:23.240 --> 21:25.200
Happy junior secretary's day.
