- Better job.
- Yeah.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.293
Copy that.

07:54.295 --> 07:55.928
How?

07:55.930 --> 07:57.897
Hey, uh, are we sold out of charcoal?

07:57.899 --> 07:59.699
- Both: Grocery.
- Hmm.

07:59.701 --> 08:01.567
Where are tampons? Electronics?

08:01.569 --> 08:03.302
No, they're where tampons normally are.

08:03.304 --> 08:04.670
Okay.

08:05.773 --> 08:08.708
How about you hang these nifty signs

08:08.710 --> 08:10.376
and then grab a mop?

08:10.378 --> 08:12.445
Because I don't think
that raccoon ever left us.

08:12.447 --> 08:14.814
Will do, uh, so... so real quick,

08:14.816 --> 08:16.182
and I hate to even mention this,

08:16.184 --> 08:18.017
but I think there's, like, a store policy

08:18.019 --> 08:19.785
against hanging flyers.

08:19.787 --> 08:22.388
Yeah, I'm not, like,
looking for a new bassist

08:22.390 --> 08:24.724
for my punk band; I think this is fine.

08:24.726 --> 08:26.459
Right, right, of course.

08:26.461 --> 08:30.763
But there really is a policy.

08:30.765 --> 08:32.164
Yeah, you just said that.

08:32.166 --> 08:35.967
But I'm now trying to do
a better job of saying it.

08:37.337 --> 08:41.340
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

08:41.342 --> 08:42.842
Condolence cards, huh?

08:42.844 --> 08:44.777
Bummer. Who died?

08:44.779 --> 08:46.278
Uh, a friend of mine.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.547
Hmm. You don't look very upset.

08:48.549 --> 08:50.416
Probably not that good a friend.

08:50.418 --> 08:52.284
Can I see a death certificate?

08:52.286 --> 08:53.986
I-I don't think I need a death certificate

08:53.988 --> 08:55.154
just to buy a card.

08:55.156 --> 08:56.422
Well, well, well.

08:56.424 --> 08:59.525
Look who knows a lot
about Cloud 9 store policies.

08:59.527 --> 09:00.726
What was your friend's name?

09:00.728 --> 09:01.894
- I don't understand...
- How did he die?

09:01.896 --> 09:03.395
What did he love? What
kind of music was he into?

09:03.397 --> 09:04.897
Billy Joel? Everybody's into Billy Joel.

09:04.899 --> 09:06.298
Was he a vegetarian or normal?

09:06.300 --> 09:07.566
The kind of guy you trust
with a lot of money or...

09:07.568 --> 09:08.901
Enough, all right?

09:08.903 --> 09:12.204
I see what you're doing, and you're right.

09:12.206 --> 09:14.306
By the end, I didn't
really know him anymore.

09:14.308 --> 09:16.776
May... maybe I never really knew him.

09:16.778 --> 09:18.244
The point is, I wasn't there for him

09:18.246 --> 09:20.146
when he needed me the most.

09:22.717 --> 09:24.383
Hmm.

09:26.821 --> 09:29.355
Funny. You don't look Jewish.

Mateo.

09:34.562 --> 09:36.228
What you doing in here?

09:36.230 --> 09:37.530
I'm investigating.

09:37.532 --> 09:39.532
What if there is no secret shopper?

09:39.534 --> 09:41.333
You ever think that
corporate is spying on us

09:41.335 --> 09:42.735
with a secret employee?

09:42.737 --> 09:46.672
Well, no, but now that's
all I can think about.

09:46.674 --> 09:48.240
You notice how Jonah

09:48.242 --> 09:50.442
never talks about what he
was doing before this job?

09:50.444 --> 09:53.846
Well, sure, but I just
figured he was a criminal.

09:53.848 --> 09:56.749
You'd be surprised how many
of our employees have been.

09:56.751 --> 09:59.218
I mean, I've always
wondered why an educated,

09:59.220 --> 10:01.353
privileged pretty boy
would decide to work here.

10:01.355 --> 10:04.790
And then I noticed Jonah's
car has Illinois plates.

10:04.792 --> 10:05.958
Oh.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.060
Do you know what else is in Illinois?

10:08.062 --> 10:11.564
Oh, soybeans.

10:11.566 --> 10:13.265
Cloud 9 headquarters.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.800
Oh!

10:14.802 --> 10:17.269
I mean, now it makes
sense how he beat my score

10:17.271 --> 10:19.972
on that test; He probably wrote the test.

10:19.974 --> 10:22.641
Okay. Let's keep this under our hats.

10:22.643 --> 10:27.046
I don't want anyone to start
acting weird around him.

10:28.049 --> 10:31.083
[chuckles]

10:33.988 --> 10:37.590
Jonah, do you know why
I called you in here?

10:37.592 --> 10:40.392
Uh, no.

10:40.394 --> 10:41.460
Am I in trouble?

10:41.462 --> 10:43.996
[nervous chuckling] As if.

10:43.998 --> 10:45.397

10:47.602 --> 10:51.737
Um, I-I don't think so.

10:51.739 --> 10:54.139
Whew. That's a relief.

10:54.141 --> 10:57.209
- Yeah.
- So, um...

10:57.211 --> 11:00.546
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

11:00.548 --> 11:03.249

- Absolutely.
- Really?

11:05.219 --> 11:07.219
Yeah. A big one.

11:07.221 --> 11:10.389
Would you be willing to
tell people about that?

11:10.391 --> 11:12.191

11:12.193 --> 11:15.427
I'll definitely... I'll
tell whoever you want, yeah.

11:54.035 --> 11:56.602
Excuse me, Dina? Have you seen Jonah?

<i>Make sure that you actually are.</i>

12:22.430 --> 12:24.596
I just said I am.

Yes, but sometimes you say
you're going to do things,

12:27.168 --> 12:28.600
and then you don't.

12:28.602 --> 12:30.970

how to do my job.</i>

this job better than me

just because you did
well on some stupid test.

12:48.622 --> 12:50.622
The test doesn't make
me think I know better.

Actually, kid, that's a lot more insightful

13:13.981 --> 13:15.881
than anything Jonah's got to say today.

13:15.883 --> 13:18.083
Our manager seems to
think I'm very insightful.

13:18.085 --> 13:19.485

I don't understand what's gotten into you.

Jonah?

was going to fire you?

- Yeah.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.902
What I mean, "Dear,"

14:32.773 --> 14:34.740

calls "an unassuming gem."

16:22.082 --> 16:23.782
Why are you getting meatballs for Jonah?
