Previously onStar Trek:
Strange New Worlds...

00:27.766 --> 00:29.638
HEMMER:
The Aenar believe
the end only comes

00:29.681 --> 00:31.292
once you have
fulfilled your purpose.

00:31.335 --> 00:33.555
-It provides meaning.
-So, what was your purpose?

00:33.598 --> 00:35.252
To fix what is broken.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.211
What do you feel is
the purpose of your life's path?

00:37.254 --> 00:39.300
I really don't know.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.649
I apologize

00:40.692 --> 00:42.694
for the incident
on the bridge

00:42.738 --> 00:44.261
between Nurse Chapel and I.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.220
I never actually believed
you could have feelings

00:46.263 --> 00:48.396
-for Nurse Chapel.
-LA'AN: The Gorn captured

00:48.439 --> 00:49.875
my family's colony ship.

00:49.919 --> 00:52.008
When they hunt,
they're unrelenting.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.228
Plenty of people
have seen the Gorn.

00:54.271 --> 00:56.317
They just don't live long enough
to talk about it.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.105
UHURA:
Cadet's personal log,

01:02.149 --> 01:04.934
stardate 2510.6.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.502
My assignment
toEnterprise is over.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.808
After we complete
our current mission

01:09.852 --> 01:13.203
delivering Vidium power cells
to deep space station K-7,

01:13.247 --> 01:15.162
I go back to Earth.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.860
I'm excited
to see my grandmother.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.775
Our last call was cut short.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.734
Life on a starship
has a way of taking over.

01:22.778 --> 01:26.086
I've rotated through
almost every department.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.958
So many amazing,
talented people.

01:29.001 --> 01:31.743
The top everyone of everything.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.920
They all know
why they belong in Starfleet.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.922
For them, Starfleet

01:36.966 --> 01:39.229
has always been the destination.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.536
For me, it was where I ran to

01:41.579 --> 01:44.016
after the loss of my parents.

01:44.060 --> 01:46.149
Serving aboardEnterprise
is an affirmation

01:46.193 --> 01:49.761
of this entire crew's
hopes and dreams.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.590
I envy their surety.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.376
But, me--

01:55.419 --> 01:57.291
I guess I'm still searching.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.119
PIKE:
Time to bend some ears.

01:59.162 --> 02:00.859
Welcome to the big send-off,

02:00.903 --> 02:01.991
although they leave us
in a couple of weeks,

02:02.034 --> 02:03.775
today it's official.

02:03.819 --> 02:06.517
Let's hear it for Cadets Chia
and Uhura for completing

02:06.561 --> 02:08.432
their training rotation
on the USS Enterprise.

02:17.441 --> 02:21.228
You have both been
exemplary crew members.

02:21.271 --> 02:24.144
Dedicated. Hardworking.

02:24.187 --> 02:25.667
Collaborative.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.059
We've seen
some things together.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.409
-MAN: Yeah, we have.
-[woman laughs]

02:28.452 --> 02:29.758
We've survived
some things together.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.194
-[scattered chuckling]
-Hmm.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.588
We are bonded now and forever

02:33.631 --> 02:35.894
by the family
that is Starfleet.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.898
And speaking of bonds
and oaths...

02:41.378 --> 02:42.771
Ensign Duke,
front and center.

02:46.296 --> 02:49.038
Effective immediately,
you are no longer an ensign.

02:49.081 --> 02:52.128
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Duke.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.608
[laughter, applause]

02:53.651 --> 02:54.826
[laughs]

02:58.439 --> 03:00.484
[quiet chatter]

03:05.663 --> 03:06.969
All this time on the ship,

03:07.012 --> 03:08.971
and you still
shy away from the crowd.

03:09.014 --> 03:10.668
Permission to speak freely, sir?

03:11.669 --> 03:13.105
Nyota, it's me.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.846
Live it up, it's a party.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.848
It's your party.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.678
Yes, permission granted.

03:21.636 --> 03:22.985
I hate goodbyes.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.814
Still haven't decided to stay?

03:27.250 --> 03:30.166
I-I know better than
to beat a dead horse,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.951
but you've made an impact here.

03:32.995 --> 03:36.216
There will always a place
on Enterprisefor Nyota Uhura.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.348
-[comm chirps]
-SPOCK: Spock to Captain Pike.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.312
What is it, Spock?

03:45.355 --> 03:47.923
Incoming priority one mission
from Starfleet Command, sir.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.751
-Spock out.
-[comm chirps]

03:49.794 --> 03:52.057
Aren't we already
a priority one mission?

03:52.101 --> 03:54.364
Yeah.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.583
Where's La'An?

03:55.626 --> 03:57.933
She couldn't make it.
She's...

03:57.976 --> 04:00.196
scheduled personal health time.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.676
She can join us in progress.

04:01.719 --> 04:02.938
Get Science and Medical.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.293
They need to send someone else.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.513
It's not
someone else's assignment.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.471
Sorry I'm late.

04:14.515 --> 04:16.734
I was with Dr. Sanchez again.

04:16.778 --> 04:19.476
-Head shrinker.
-It's called
Starfleet recovery assistance,

04:19.520 --> 04:21.130
and I'm glad
you're making use of it.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.479
You're on time.
We're just kicking around

04:22.523 --> 04:23.785
some intel on a mission brief.

04:23.828 --> 04:25.395
While you clean up?

04:25.439 --> 04:27.397
People are capable of doing
two things at once.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.442
Spock?

04:28.485 --> 04:30.139
Approximately four days ago,

04:30.182 --> 04:32.010
the USS Peregrineactivated
a distress beacon

04:32.054 --> 04:33.447
before losing contact.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.624
Can you take over the dishes
for a minute?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.365
Oh. Yes, of course.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.368
Saved you a plate.

04:41.411 --> 04:42.891
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.327
You're gonna want to try
the omelet and the bacon.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.850
And the waffle.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.330
PIKE:
The Peregrine'sdeep space relay

04:47.374 --> 04:49.898
took two days
to reach Starfleet.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.465
Another two to us,

04:51.508 --> 04:54.076
so we might still have contact,
just delayed.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.339
-Oh, my God, this is delicious.
-Told you.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.428
SPOCK:
At the time of transmission,
the Peregrinewas making

04:58.472 --> 05:01.475
an unscheduled emergency landing
on a class L planet.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.911
Valeo Beta Five.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.261
Are emergency landings
ever scheduled?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.741
The ship made its descent
but its beacon

05:06.784 --> 05:08.264
went out mid-transmission.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.353
Destroyed on impact?
Where... Uh, do you

05:10.397 --> 05:11.789
have the... Where's the, um...

05:11.833 --> 05:13.269
-Extra cheese?
-Mm.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.445
While possible,
it is more likely

05:15.489 --> 05:18.361
the interference on Valeo Beta
Five has disrupted the signal.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.972
The upper atmosphere is littered
with charged nitrate ions.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.365
UNA:
Planet's a known dead zone.

05:22.409 --> 05:23.975
Our communications
and transporters

05:24.019 --> 05:25.325
don't reach the surface.

05:25.368 --> 05:28.240
A Sombra-class ship,
that's unique.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.982
I served on one. Fast.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.028
Built with the same parts
as a Constitution.

05:33.071 --> 05:34.377
PIKE:
She'd gone off the grid,

05:34.421 --> 05:36.771
gathering data
in uncharted sectors.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.250
The Federation wants us
to aid the crew

05:38.294 --> 05:40.252
and, if possible,
retrieve the ship.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.429
And our current mission?

05:42.472 --> 05:44.387
The Vidium power cells for K-7--

05:44.431 --> 05:46.389
without them the whole
space station goes dark.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.130
Including life support.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.349
The nearest ship
that could deliver them for us

05:49.392 --> 05:50.654
is a week away.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.656
SPOCK:
Vidium cells decay in transport.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.658
A delay of that duration
would render them all useless.

05:54.702 --> 05:57.182
I advise we send a landing party

05:57.226 --> 05:59.271
to make repairs
and treat the wounded.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.708
Meanwhile,
Enterprisecan continue on

06:00.751 --> 06:02.013
to deliver the Vidium.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.580
Like you said, sir.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.366
People are capable
of doing two things at once.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.847
-Let me get you some bacon.
-It's risky.

06:09.891 --> 06:12.284
There's no way the landing party
could contact the ship.

06:12.328 --> 06:15.375
True, it is
a communications dead zone,

06:15.418 --> 06:17.812
but I have faith in our crew
to get it done.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.596
The Enterprisecan pick us up
on the way back.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.164
-Us?
-PIKE: I'll oversee this one
personally.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.861
Get the cadets out
on one last away mission

06:23.905 --> 06:25.689
with senior officers.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.299
You sure you want to
split the crew?

06:27.343 --> 06:28.779
It'll be fine, Number One.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.912
You get the supplies to K-7.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.261
I'll pile the kids
in the station wagon,

06:32.304 --> 06:33.610
take a road trip.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.656
Sir? The station wagon?

06:36.831 --> 06:38.398
Anybody has to go,
now's the time.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.487
Do not make me
turn this car around.

06:43.272 --> 06:45.796
Okay. You have your orders.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.149
[over comms]:
Number One, you're good to go.
We're making our descent now.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.413
UNA:
We'll monitor your approach.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.415
PIKE:
That's a negative. Once we enter
the upper atmosphere,

06:55.458 --> 06:58.243
we're going to be out of
contact either w...

06:58.287 --> 06:59.723
[distorted]:
Make haste to K-7.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.778
[thunder rumbling]

07:23.486 --> 07:25.488
[wind whistling]

07:31.015 --> 07:33.540
Man, this is gonna be a hike.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.498
Geothermal anomalies
have forced us to land

07:35.542 --> 07:37.282
several kilometers
from the Peregrine.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.807
We should work quickly.
This area is highly volatile.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.156
It is due to be overrun
by an ice storm

07:41.199 --> 07:42.592
in approximately six hours.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.507
This wind

07:44.551 --> 07:46.944
reminds me of Andoria.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.032
-[laughs]
-[exhales]

07:48.076 --> 07:50.470
Glad someone can enjoy it.

07:50.513 --> 07:53.385
The anomalies-- is that
what's killing our comms?

07:53.429 --> 07:54.604
Negative, Ensign.

07:54.648 --> 07:55.997
It is the ionic interference

07:56.040 --> 07:57.564
that prevents
long-range communication.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.914
Drink.
You owe him a drink, Spock.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.527
Duke's a lieutenant now.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.268
Call him an ensign,
you got to buy him a drink.

08:06.311 --> 08:07.704
Starfleet tradition.

08:08.662 --> 08:10.968
Another human drinking game.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.753
Does their number have no limit?

08:12.796 --> 08:14.058
Nope.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.499
Based on these readings,

08:19.542 --> 08:21.936
the Peregrinemade landfall
near the ridge of a great chasm.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.025
No life signs, anything?

08:27.202 --> 08:28.682
Still too much interference.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.162
PIKE:
We should be getting something.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.599
LA'AN:
Captain,

08:32.642 --> 08:34.688
might not be a scanning problem.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.350
PIKE:
Space.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.745
The final frontier.

08:50.704 --> 08:55.447
These are the voyages
of the starshipEnterprise.

08:55.491 --> 08:58.320
Its five-year mission:

08:58.363 --> 09:01.541
to explore strange new worlds...

09:03.543 --> 09:06.023
...to seek out new life

09:06.067 --> 09:09.636
and new civilizations,

09:09.679 --> 09:13.727

11:14.761 --> 11:17.851
I want a full diagnostic.
As fast as you can.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.380
Any luck on the internal comms?

11:25.423 --> 11:27.512
No. Still down.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.863
And environmental systems
are at 20%.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.213
Captain, the bridge
is completely offline.

11:32.256 --> 11:35.303
Someone hardwired all the
controls down to Engineering.

11:35.346 --> 11:36.696
Why would they do that?

11:36.739 --> 11:38.262
HEMMER:
Plasma in the main circuits.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.090
That's not typical.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.962
They were likely using energy
from the warp core injectors

11:42.005 --> 11:43.267
as emergency power.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.529
But that would imply...

11:44.573 --> 11:45.879
UHURA:
No backup batteries.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.185
And the matter-antimatter
reactor's busted.

-Hem, can you fix it?
-Perhaps.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.757
I'll have to work
in Engineering.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.369
Mr. Spock, can you manage
restoring bridge functions?

11:58.413 --> 11:59.806
I will attempt
to make quick work of it.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.590
[clattering]

12:07.378 --> 12:08.640
It's grim.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.780
The Peregrinehas a crew of 99.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.565
There could be more
we didn't find.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.959
Most died of hypothermia.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.701
Their suits are shredded
by the elements.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.965
Some of them
were picked apart, maybe...

34:03.389 --> 34:05.043
Fascinating.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.088
The Gorn's biological makeup
renders them invisible

34:07.132 --> 34:08.742
to all of our sensors.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.744
A genetic chameleon.

34:10.787 --> 34:12.702
That's how I missed them
inside of Buckley.

34:12.746 --> 34:14.791
Was there anything
from his bioscan we can use?

35:22.381 --> 35:23.556
we have to stop

and start listening.
Hemmer,

35:25.775 --> 35:27.864
what is it you're trying
to tell us about the nav com?

35:27.908 --> 35:29.257
It's the only system left
to reboot.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.693
Everything else is online.

35:30.737 --> 35:32.434
That means
our mission is complete.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.914
That would be correct.

35:33.957 --> 35:36.525
Okay. Now let's
get rid of these Gorn.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.179
La'An, tactical analysis.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.877
The hatchlings
have begun molting,

35:40.921 --> 35:43.010
but they aren't fully mature.

35:43.053 --> 35:45.099
At this stage,
younglings have an intense drive

35:45.143 --> 35:46.840
for alpha dominance.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.103
The two left
will be the strongest,

35:49.147 --> 35:52.411
the smartest, and extremely
hostile to each other.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.152
That's a weak spot.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.979
We can work together,
that's our advantage.

35:56.023 --> 35:58.156
No matter what,
we have to kill them now.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.506
We'd have no chance
even against one adult Gorn.

36:00.549 --> 36:03.117
These younglings move too fast
for us to hunt.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.206
We'll have to create
a choke point.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.991
The Gorn are highly intelligent,
even at this stage.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.385
A simple trap won't work.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.257
How are we
supposed to hunt them?

36:12.300 --> 36:14.259
We-we can't even track them
with sensors.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.043
We make them come to us.

36:16.086 --> 36:19.089
That is... very logical.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.875
Gorn can't resist
aggressive behavior.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.877
They won't back down
from a challenge, so...

36:23.920 --> 36:26.140
we can use that
to draw them out, put them down.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.011
Great. Now we're bait.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.971
We can use
