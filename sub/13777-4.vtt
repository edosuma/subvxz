00:02.012 --> 00:03.315
(gunshots)

00:03.315 --> 00:05.719
(both yelling)

00:05.719 --> 00:07.691
(both grunting)

00:10.530 --> 00:11.732
>> Oh, no!

00:11.732 --> 00:14.204
(both groan)

00:14.204 --> 00:16.175
High five?

00:17.679 --> 00:18.681
>> Oh.

00:18.681 --> 00:20.151
Oh, Rafi!

00:20.151 --> 00:21.520
Get up!

00:21.520 --> 00:23.324
Get up, you big idiot!

00:23.324 --> 00:26.497
Get up! Rafi! Rafi!

00:26.497 --> 00:28.201
This is it, Evan.

00:28.201 --> 00:29.236
We did it.

00:29.236 --> 00:31.240
Bear Stearns Plaza.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.243
The crown jewel of the Bear

00:32.243 --> 00:33.245
Stearns empire.

00:33.245 --> 00:34.214
>> And we were the ones

00:34.214 --> 00:35.216
that built it.

00:35.216 --> 00:36.218
>> Well, I think there's only

00:36.218 --> 00:37.220
one way to celebrate this.

00:37.220 --> 00:38.357
You thinking what I'm thinking?

00:38.357 --> 00:40.327
>> BOTH: Champagne!

00:42.164 --> 00:43.166
(laughs)

00:43.166 --> 00:44.202
>> Ooh, the good stuff!

00:44.202 --> 00:45.605
>> To Randall and Evan!

00:45.605 --> 00:46.641
>> Ah, oh! Shoot!

00:46.641 --> 00:47.643
(screams)

00:47.643 --> 00:49.748
>> Evan!

00:49.748 --> 00:53.121
No!

00:53.121 --> 00:54.290
>> Daddy, Daddy!

00:54.290 --> 00:55.660
The ice cream truck didn't stop.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.196
>> What?

00:57.196 --> 00:58.499
>> Would you, hon?

00:58.499 --> 00:59.769
>> All right, three ice creams

00:59.769 --> 01:00.871
coming up!

01:00.871 --> 01:02.141
>> Thanks, baby.

01:02.141 --> 01:03.143
>> Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:03.143 --> 01:04.145
Hey, how are you?

01:04.145 --> 01:05.147
Can I get three vanilla cones,

01:05.147 --> 01:06.149
please?

01:06.149 --> 01:07.117
>> Isn't he the best daddy?

01:07.117 --> 01:08.119
>> Yup.

01:08.119 --> 01:09.356
>> Ooh, look at that.

01:09.356 --> 01:10.391
Thanks so much.

01:10.391 --> 01:12.429
(Evan screaming)

01:12.429 --> 01:14.400
(woman and children scream)

01:17.740 --> 01:20.379
>> No!

01:20.379 --> 01:23.619
Why?!

01:32.705 --> 01:34.142
>> Wait...

01:34.142 --> 01:35.311
What is this place?

01:35.311 --> 01:36.313
Where am I?

01:36.313 --> 01:37.316
>> Rafael, we have been

01:37.316 --> 01:38.551
expecting you.

01:38.551 --> 01:39.553
My name is Nurse Pam.

01:39.553 --> 01:40.555
This is your orderly

01:40.555 --> 01:41.524
Mr. Spazanelli.

01:41.524 --> 01:42.526
I'm gonna need you to fill out

01:42.526 --> 01:43.529
this paperwork.

01:43.529 --> 01:44.531
>> I-I got to, I have to go

01:44.531 --> 01:45.533
back to home.

01:45.533 --> 01:46.535
I have to go where my wife is

01:46.535 --> 01:47.537
and my kids.

01:47.537 --> 01:48.539
>> Your wife is dead.

01:48.539 --> 01:49.541
>> No!

01:49.541 --> 01:50.544
>> Your children are dead.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.546
>> No, that's not true!

01:51.546 --> 01:52.815
>> So, marital status will be

01:52.815 --> 01:53.817
single and children is zero.

01:53.817 --> 01:54.752
>> Oh!

01:54.752 --> 01:55.621
>> I don't belong here.

01:55.621 --> 01:56.489
I don't need to be here.

01:56.489 --> 01:57.358
>> Randall.

01:57.358 --> 01:58.326
>> I think there's been some

01:58.326 --> 01:59.329
sort of mistake.

01:59.329 --> 02:00.331
>> I think you do need to be

02:00.331 --> 02:01.267
here because I think you've

02:01.267 --> 02:02.202
tried to commit suicide over 75

02:02.202 --> 02:02.904
times according to your file.

02:02.904 --> 02:03.839
So, if you could fill out this

02:03.839 --> 02:04.841
paperwork.

02:04.841 --> 02:05.843
>> Well, all these razor blades

02:05.843 --> 02:06.845
in my bag, I need those 'cause

02:06.845 --> 02:07.847
I might shave later, so don't

02:07.847 --> 02:08.849
take those.

02:08.849 --> 02:09.852
>> Okay, did you hear that,

02:09.852 --> 02:10.854
Spazanelli?

02:10.854 --> 02:11.856
>> I hate rats, so I need all

02:11.856 --> 02:12.858
the rat poison I have.

02:12.858 --> 02:14.194
>> I have to hang myself later.

02:14.194 --> 02:15.197
>> You get these back never!

02:15.197 --> 02:16.199
>> What?

02:16.199 --> 02:17.201
>> What? "Never"?!

02:17.201 --> 02:18.203
>> Wait...

02:18.203 --> 02:19.205
>> Why... That's not a time.

02:19.205 --> 02:20.207
>> Not never, like, just when

02:20.207 --> 02:21.209
you get checked out, that's when

02:21.209 --> 02:22.212
you get it back.

02:22.212 --> 02:23.214
>> Okay, that sounds reasonable.

02:23.214 --> 02:24.316
>> Practically never, though.

02:24.316 --> 02:25.318
>> Okay, so you have tried to

02:25.318 --> 02:26.353
hang yourselves?

02:26.353 --> 02:27.388
>> A bunch of times.

02:27.388 --> 02:28.491
Doctor says I have something

02:28.491 --> 02:29.627
called strong neck.

02:29.627 --> 02:30.796
>> This shit is tight as hell!

02:30.796 --> 02:32.233
>> No, that's my Sidekick!

02:32.233 --> 02:33.268
>> Not anymore.

02:33.268 --> 02:34.270
>> What?!

02:34.270 --> 02:35.272
>> If you could just fill out

02:35.272 --> 02:36.275
the paperwork, that would be

02:36.275 --> 02:38.379
very helpful.

02:38.379 --> 02:39.381
>> Hey, man, it sounds like

02:39.381 --> 02:40.383
you're really good at trying to

02:40.383 --> 02:41.385
commit suicide.

02:41.385 --> 02:42.388
>> I'm good at "trying."

02:42.388 --> 02:43.390
I suck at "doing."

02:43.390 --> 02:44.392
>> I know. Me, too.

02:44.392 --> 02:45.394
So, I called a suicide hotline

02:45.394 --> 02:46.396
'cause I thought they would,

02:46.396 --> 02:47.365
like, give me advice...

02:47.365 --> 02:48.200
>> No, it's not!

02:48.200 --> 02:48.768
>> It's not.

02:48.768 --> 02:49.770
>> They just talk you out of it!

02:49.770 --> 02:50.772
>> They tried to talk me out of

02:50.772 --> 02:51.774
it, which I thought was rude!

02:51.774 --> 02:52.776
>> Yeah, it was very rude!

02:52.776 --> 02:53.778
>> I miss them so much.

02:53.778 --> 02:55.616
>> What's your name, man?

02:55.616 --> 02:57.587
>> Rafael.

02:57.587 --> 02:59.257
>> I'm Randall.

02:59.257 --> 03:00.259
>> Nice to meet you.

03:00.259 --> 03:01.428
>> Oh, I'm, uh...

03:01.428 --> 03:02.598
I actually don't shake hands.

03:02.598 --> 03:03.633
I'm kind of a clean, neat freak,

03:03.633 --> 03:04.869
germophobe.

03:04.869 --> 03:06.004
>> Oh, well, Clean Randall, huh?

03:06.004 --> 03:07.007
>> Yeah, that's what they call

03:07.007 --> 03:08.009
me.

03:08.009 --> 03:09.011
>> Oh, that's funny. (chuckles)

03:09.011 --> 03:10.982
>> Yeah.

03:14.356 --> 03:15.425
>> Okay... okay, Spazanelli?

03:15.425 --> 03:16.962
This is your job.

03:16.962 --> 03:17.997
>> You hold mine, I'll hold

03:17.997 --> 03:18.999
yours!

03:18.999 --> 03:20.001
>> You have to do your job.

03:20.001 --> 03:21.738
No! You're helping them!

03:21.738 --> 03:23.442
You're helping them.

03:23.442 --> 03:25.245
(both yelling)

03:25.245 --> 03:26.247
>> No! No, I want to die!

03:26.247 --> 03:27.250
>> It's the only job you have.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.519
>> I want to die!

03:28.519 --> 03:29.822
>> Let's go! We're done!

03:29.822 --> 03:31.827
>> It's the only job you have.

03:31.827 --> 03:33.430
>> All right, psychos.

03:33.430 --> 03:34.933
Here are your bunks.

03:34.933 --> 03:37.271
You will keep your bunks clean.

03:37.271 --> 03:38.775
If you do not keep your bunks

03:38.775 --> 03:39.910
clean, you will have to answer

03:39.910 --> 03:41.314
to me.

03:41.314 --> 03:42.750
I am in charge here.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.520
Mail time! Joel.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.524
Neil, here's your mail.

03:46.524 --> 03:47.727
Read up.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.963
>> It's blacked out again.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.065
I'm telling you there's no point

03:50.065 --> 03:51.468
in allowing the U.S. Postal

03:51.468 --> 03:52.905
Service to deliver my mail if

03:52.905 --> 03:54.307
you're going to black out all

03:54.307 --> 03:55.544
the pertinent information!

03:55.544 --> 03:57.581
What is the introductory APR?

03:57.581 --> 03:58.817
What poetry has been written to

03:58.817 --> 03:59.987
me by the coupon writers at

03:59.987 --> 04:01.857
Macy's department store?

04:01.857 --> 04:02.859
>> All the important parts are

04:02.859 --> 04:03.928
still there.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.598
And I'm going to keep this.

04:05.598 --> 04:06.600
>> The cat magazine with a

04:06.600 --> 04:07.837
dickhole in it?

04:07.837 --> 04:09.306
>> It's not an obvious dickhole.

04:09.306 --> 04:10.409
>> Oh, it's obviously the size

04:10.409 --> 04:11.478
and girth of a dick.

04:11.478 --> 04:12.480
>> It's not a dickhole.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.482
>> BOTH: What is it for?

04:13.482 --> 04:14.484
>> You can have sex with my

04:14.484 --> 04:15.486
magazine, just please tell me

04:15.486 --> 04:16.856
if they published my letter to

04:16.856 --> 04:18.359
the editor.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.361
>> Come on, Howard.

04:19.361 --> 04:20.397
>> That guy's super into cat

04:20.397 --> 04:21.632
magazines sexually.

04:21.632 --> 04:22.702
>> Gentlemen, my name is Neil M.

04:22.702 --> 04:23.737
and this is my associate

04:23.737 --> 04:24.906
Mr. Joel Cock.

04:24.906 --> 04:26.042
>> Cool name.

04:26.042 --> 04:27.045
>> Welcome to the Cook County

04:27.045 --> 04:28.347
Psychiatric Institute,

04:28.347 --> 04:29.817
originally founded in 1812 for

04:29.817 --> 04:31.588
murderers, homosexuals and

04:31.588 --> 04:32.623
people who didn't know how

04:32.623 --> 04:34.460
to sail.

04:38.903 --> 04:39.905
>> Okay, let's start off our

04:39.905 --> 04:40.907
group therapy session as we

04:40.907 --> 04:41.909
always do-- checking in with

04:41.909 --> 04:42.912
just how insane everyone is

04:42.912 --> 04:44.114
feeling today.

04:44.114 --> 04:45.751
Neil?

04:45.751 --> 04:46.753
>> I remain perfectly sane as I

04:46.753 --> 04:48.524
was last week.

04:48.524 --> 04:49.994
For those of you who don't know

04:49.994 --> 04:51.797
my story, in the past I received

04:51.797 --> 04:53.066
a message from the future saying

04:53.066 --> 04:54.370
that I would wind up in an

04:54.370 --> 04:55.672
insane asylum.

04:55.672 --> 04:56.674
I wait patiently for my future

04:56.674 --> 04:57.977
self to arrive so that I may

04:57.977 --> 04:59.948
secure his release.

04:59.948 --> 05:01.552
I faked my insanity by stealing

05:01.552 --> 05:03.822
neighborhood pets, stuffing them

05:03.822 --> 05:04.959
inside each other and mailing

05:04.959 --> 05:06.595
them to professors.

05:06.595 --> 05:08.934
>> "Neil as nutty as ever."

05:08.934 --> 05:11.004
>> Not nutty. Certain.

05:11.004 --> 05:12.608
>> Okay, now we have some new

05:12.608 --> 05:13.678
members of our group.

05:13.678 --> 05:14.680
Would you guys like to introduce

05:14.680 --> 05:15.682
yourselves, please?

05:15.682 --> 05:16.684
>> Hi.

05:16.684 --> 05:17.686
>> I'm Randall.

05:17.686 --> 05:18.688
I guess I'm here 'cause I

05:18.688 --> 05:19.690
accidently caused the death of

05:19.690 --> 05:20.759
my best friend and business

05:20.759 --> 05:21.761
partner, and I've just been

05:21.761 --> 05:23.164
having a rough time lately.

05:23.164 --> 05:24.467
>> Great.

05:24.467 --> 05:25.603
>> I'm, uh, Rafael.

05:25.603 --> 05:26.973
My family was killed in front of

05:26.973 --> 05:29.444
my eyes about six months ago on

05:29.444 --> 05:30.847
a city street in Chicago.

05:30.847 --> 05:32.584
>> Wow, that's crazy.

05:32.584 --> 05:33.720
>> A man, who had been pushed

05:33.720 --> 05:35.791
off of a 125-story building,

05:35.791 --> 05:39.466
fell on top of them, crushing

05:39.466 --> 05:41.904
them into the ground, creating a

05:41.904 --> 05:45.579
human disaster of organs,

05:45.579 --> 05:47.081
viscera and blood.

05:47.081 --> 05:49.988
I have vowed to find out who

05:49.988 --> 05:52.059
pushed the falling man to kill

05:52.059 --> 05:54.498
him in a manner that befits the

05:54.498 --> 05:58.072
horrors that he fell upon me!

05:58.072 --> 05:59.776
I will destroy him!

05:59.776 --> 06:01.813
Top to bottom!

06:01.813 --> 06:03.885
"T" to "B"!

06:03.885 --> 06:05.655
>> Hope you find him.

06:05.655 --> 06:06.857
>> Great. William, last week we

06:06.857 --> 06:07.993
were talking about your mother?

06:07.993 --> 06:08.961
>> Yeah, I do, I don't want to

06:08.961 --> 06:10.465
talk-talk about my mother, just

06:10.465 --> 06:12.670
do, add 4-3-7...

06:12.670 --> 06:13.672
>> She was making a grilled

06:13.672 --> 06:14.674
cheese sandwich for you.

06:14.674 --> 06:15.676
She realized she forgot to put

06:15.676 --> 06:16.678
the tomatoes in and then she

06:16.678 --> 06:17.680
jumped inside the oven to kill

06:17.680 --> 06:18.682
herself.

06:18.682 --> 06:19.685
>> I don't want to talk

06:19.685 --> 06:20.687
about my mom in the oven!

06:20.687 --> 06:21.689
>> Closed the oven door.

06:21.689 --> 06:22.691
She stared at you through the

06:22.691 --> 06:23.660
little tiny window...

06:23.660 --> 06:24.695
>> I don't want to talk about

06:24.695 --> 06:25.697
my mom!

06:25.697 --> 06:26.700
>> Okay, look, look, you're

06:26.700 --> 06:27.702
upsetting him. He doesn't want

06:27.702 --> 06:28.704
to talk about it!

06:28.704 --> 06:29.706
>> I-I think maybe just move on.

06:29.706 --> 06:30.708
>> Maybe it's not working at all

06:30.708 --> 06:31.710
what Nurse Pam is doing here.

06:31.710 --> 06:32.712
>> No, I don't think this

06:32.712 --> 06:33.715
particular thing is working.

06:33.715 --> 06:34.717
>> I mean, are you...?

06:34.717 --> 06:35.719
>> Maybe it would be better if

06:35.719 --> 06:36.955
Nurse Pam sent William to

06:36.955 --> 06:37.957
electroshock therapy.

06:37.957 --> 06:38.959
>> Why would he want that?

06:38.959 --> 06:39.962
>> Robert, please take William

06:39.962 --> 06:40.964
to the electroshock therapy

06:40.964 --> 06:41.932
room.

06:41.932 --> 06:42.934
>> Why would you do that to him?

06:42.934 --> 06:43.936
>> No, don't do that to him.

06:43.936 --> 06:44.938
>> That makes no sense at all.

06:44.938 --> 06:45.774
>> I feel like you're

06:45.774 --> 06:46.776
overreacting.

06:46.776 --> 06:47.778
>> Yeah, it's disproportionate.

06:47.778 --> 06:48.646
The punishment does not fit

06:48.646 --> 06:49.181
the crime here.

06:49.181 --> 06:50.116
>> I'm gonna need you both

06:50.116 --> 06:50.751
to calm down.

06:50.751 --> 06:51.653
>> We're being pretty calm

06:51.653 --> 06:52.221
actually, I mean...

06:52.221 --> 06:53.223
>> I think we're very rational.

06:53.223 --> 06:54.225
>> Lower your voices.

06:54.225 --> 06:55.227
(quieter indistinct chatter)

06:55.227 --> 06:56.229
And now I'm gonna need you

06:56.229 --> 06:57.231
both to sit down.

06:57.231 --> 06:58.233
>> We are sitting.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.236
>> I couldn't do this if I

06:59.236 --> 06:59.970
wasn't sitting.

06:59.970 --> 07:00.972
>> I don't feel safe.

07:00.972 --> 07:01.975
I got a code red. Kevin!

07:01.975 --> 07:02.977
Please take them to the

07:02.977 --> 07:03.979
electroshock therapy room

07:03.979 --> 07:04.981
immediately.

07:04.981 --> 07:05.983
They're absolutely out of

07:05.983 --> 07:06.985
control.

07:06.985 --> 07:07.987
>> We'll walk voluntarily...

07:07.987 --> 07:08.990
>> They're out of control!

07:08.990 --> 07:09.992
>> I'm actually being very

07:09.992 --> 07:10.994
pragmatic, very open, very

07:10.994 --> 07:11.996
communicative.

07:11.996 --> 07:12.998
I think we learned our lesson!

07:12.998 --> 07:14.000
>> Yeah, what did we do?

07:14.000 --> 07:14.969
Why are we even here?

07:14.969 --> 07:15.972
>> Now, Rafael, before

07:15.972 --> 07:16.974
electroshock treatment, I

07:16.974 --> 07:17.976
usually call family members and

07:17.976 --> 07:18.978
let them know this is about

07:18.978 --> 07:19.980
to happen.

07:19.980 --> 07:20.982
>> Uh-huh.

07:20.982 --> 07:21.984
>> But yours are all dead.

07:21.984 --> 07:22.987
>> Oh, come on. Hey, hey!

07:22.987 --> 07:23.989
>> You can call my sister.

07:23.989 --> 07:24.991
>> I don't know why we're doing

07:24.991 --> 07:25.993
this...

07:25.993 --> 07:26.995
>> Now, listen, if I start

07:26.995 --> 07:27.997
smiling or laughing while it's

07:27.997 --> 07:28.999
happening, it's because I'm

07:28.999 --> 07:30.001
enjoying breaking you down.

07:30.001 --> 07:31.004
>> Breaking us down?

07:31.004 --> 07:32.006
You don't have to...

07:32.006 --> 07:35.246
(both grunting)

07:35.246 --> 07:37.117
>> It did make me laugh!

07:37.117 --> 07:38.219
It did make me laugh.

07:38.219 --> 07:39.255
>> Aah, it hurts!

07:39.255 --> 07:40.290
>> Please don't do that again!

07:40.290 --> 07:41.292
Please don't do that again!

07:41.292 --> 07:42.327
>> All right, one more.

07:42.327 --> 07:44.866
(both grunting)

07:44.866 --> 07:46.236
>> Here we go.

07:46.236 --> 07:47.673
All right.

07:47.673 --> 07:48.808
(groaning)

07:48.808 --> 07:50.646
There you... there you go.

07:50.646 --> 07:52.316
You're all right.

07:52.316 --> 07:54.287
(both groaning)

07:57.026 --> 07:58.729
(both laughing)

07:58.729 --> 07:59.765
>> That's not bad!

07:59.765 --> 08:00.767
>> That one felt good.

08:00.767 --> 08:01.770
>> Yeah, I'm kind of, like,

08:01.770 --> 08:02.772
energized like I just had

08:02.772 --> 08:03.774
an espresso.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.776
>> I feel my personality is

08:04.776 --> 08:05.778
changing a little bit, though.

08:05.778 --> 08:06.780
>> Yeah, but for the better,

08:06.780 --> 08:07.782
though, right?

08:07.782 --> 08:08.785
>> Yeah, yeah, for the better.

08:08.785 --> 08:10.154
(both grunting)

08:10.154 --> 08:11.591
(laughs)

08:11.591 --> 08:12.926
>> Screw you.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.296
>> Yeah!

08:14.296 --> 08:16.634
High five!

08:16.634 --> 08:18.037
>> Gentlemen, time for exercise.

08:18.037 --> 08:20.876
>> Why don't you exercise this?

08:20.876 --> 08:22.146
No.

08:22.146 --> 08:24.250
Why don't you exercise this?

08:24.250 --> 08:25.621
(gasps)

08:25.621 --> 08:27.591
Yeah!

08:27.591 --> 08:30.030
That feels good.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.001
(both grunting)

08:35.308 --> 08:36.810
What was that-- five?

08:36.810 --> 08:38.114
>> I'm gonna guess a four.

08:38.114 --> 08:39.249
>> A six.

08:39.249 --> 08:40.284
>> Hey, how about this?

08:40.284 --> 08:41.921
Give us a two, then a seven,

08:41.921 --> 08:43.325
then a four.

08:43.325 --> 08:44.995
>> My pleasure.

08:44.995 --> 08:48.301
(both grunting)

08:48.301 --> 08:52.077
I'm starving.

08:52.077 --> 08:53.681
>> That's a turd. Big time.

08:53.681 --> 08:54.783
(laughing)

08:54.783 --> 08:55.785
>> It's his!

08:55.785 --> 08:56.787
>> Did you find my turd?

08:56.787 --> 08:57.789
>> She did!

08:57.789 --> 08:58.791
>> I turded in there!

08:58.791 --> 09:00.061
>> Yeah, totally!

09:00.061 --> 09:00.862
>> So instead of eating your

09:00.862 --> 09:02.065
stupid sandwich, you can snack

09:02.065 --> 09:02.800
on a dick.

09:02.800 --> 09:03.668
>> But we didn't have a dick...

09:03.668 --> 09:04.203
>> No.

09:04.203 --> 09:05.205
>> ...so we turded in there!

09:05.205 --> 09:05.940
>> Boom!

09:05.940 --> 09:06.674
Shit-dick!

09:06.674 --> 09:07.209
>> Yeah.

09:07.209 --> 09:08.178
>> Snack on it!

09:08.178 --> 09:09.080
Shock us!

09:09.080 --> 09:09.948
>> Shock us!

09:09.948 --> 09:11.351
(shuddering)

09:11.351 --> 09:12.887
>> Oh... oh.

09:12.887 --> 09:13.957
Is that the best you can do,

09:13.957 --> 09:14.892
bitch?

09:14.892 --> 09:16.161
>> Oh, no, I got more than that.

09:16.161 --> 09:17.230
But first you do me, do me.

09:17.230 --> 09:17.965
>> All right.

09:17.965 --> 09:18.700
Okay, okay, okay.

09:18.700 --> 09:19.902
You ready? Go!

09:19.902 --> 09:21.841
(screams)

09:21.841 --> 09:23.043
(laughing)

09:23.043 --> 09:24.345
>> This is how they made the

09:24.345 --> 09:25.448
Incredible Hulk.

09:25.448 --> 09:26.049
>> Guess what.

09:26.049 --> 09:26.684
>> What?

09:26.684 --> 09:27.319
>> I don't need these anymore.

09:27.319 --> 09:27.920
>> Nice.

09:27.920 --> 09:28.989
You do me while I do you.

09:28.989 --> 09:29.991
>> That's a great idea.

09:29.991 --> 09:31.227
>> Right? Brothers.

09:31.227 --> 09:33.198
(screaming)

09:33.198 --> 09:33.932
>> Hey!

09:33.932 --> 09:34.801
Turn that off!

09:34.801 --> 09:35.937
>> What is the matter with you

09:35.937 --> 09:36.706
idiots?

09:36.706 --> 09:37.240
(laughing)

09:37.240 --> 09:39.779
>> Nothing, nothing.

09:41.249 --> 09:42.251
Hey, hey, easy.

09:42.251 --> 09:43.419
We're all on the same team, man.

09:43.419 --> 09:44.723
>> You're hurting my arm. Ow.

09:44.723 --> 09:45.390
>> Rafael, Randall, are you

09:45.390 --> 09:46.225
okay?

09:46.225 --> 09:46.960
What happened?

09:46.960 --> 09:47.729
>> Rafael and Randall?

09:47.729 --> 09:48.764
They were electrocuted to death.

09:48.764 --> 09:49.299
(laughs)

09:49.299 --> 09:50.067
>> I took the power of

09:50.067 --> 09:51.871
electricity and I killed the

09:51.871 --> 09:54.744
lonely, emotional Rafael.

09:54.744 --> 09:56.314
And now I am Rafi.

09:56.314 --> 09:57.082
>> Exactly.

09:57.082 --> 09:59.020
And I took Clean Randall and I

09:59.020 --> 10:00.422
acknowledged that I'm actually a

10:00.422 --> 10:02.360
filth monster who loves the

10:02.360 --> 10:03.964
grossest stuff on Earth, so I'm

10:03.964 --> 10:04.933
Dirty Randy now.

10:04.933 --> 10:05.700
>> Yeah.

10:05.700 --> 10:06.970
And also, now we can high-five.

10:06.970 --> 10:07.705
>> We can high-five now.

10:07.705 --> 10:08.239
We can high-five now.

10:08.239 --> 10:10.144
>> How rad is that?

10:10.144 --> 10:12.715
Every time!

10:12.715 --> 10:13.852
>> Not that time.

10:13.852 --> 10:14.452
>> Okay, not that time.

10:14.452 --> 10:15.387
>> Heads up, turds!

10:15.387 --> 10:16.390
>> Ooh!

10:16.390 --> 10:17.292
>> Look who's here.

10:17.292 --> 10:18.929
>> Sexy lady alert.

10:18.929 --> 10:19.730
>> Please don't.

10:19.730 --> 10:20.766
I hear you were in the

10:20.766 --> 10:21.902
electroshock therapy room today.

10:21.902 --> 10:22.470
>> Oh, yeah.

10:22.470 --> 10:23.304
>> Unsupervised?

10:23.304 --> 10:24.173
>> All day.

10:24.173 --> 10:24.941
>> Well, we've been there

10:24.941 --> 10:25.776
enough, so we kind of know how

10:25.776 --> 10:26.211
it works.

10:26.211 --> 10:27.247
>> You are not allowed in there!

10:27.247 --> 10:28.382
>> (quietly): Mr. Spazanelli, I

10:28.382 --> 10:29.251
need you to lower your voice...

10:29.251 --> 10:30.052
>> Whoa, sassy.

10:30.052 --> 10:30.888
>> Oh, look at this.

10:30.888 --> 10:31.422
>> Ooh, he's hard.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.458
>> His dick is hard.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.226
>> His wiener's hard!

10:33.226 --> 10:34.061
>> My dick isn't hard!

10:34.061 --> 10:34.763
>> Yes, it is!

10:34.763 --> 10:35.297
>> Oh, come on, man!

10:35.297 --> 10:36.834
>> Please stop pointing at Mr.

10:36.834 --> 10:37.969
Spazanelli's penis.

10:37.969 --> 10:38.738
>> Prude.

10:38.738 --> 10:39.439
(blowing raspberries)

10:39.439 --> 10:41.277
>> Please do not make that sound

10:41.277 --> 10:42.412
and do not make that gesture

10:42.412 --> 10:43.281
again.

10:43.281 --> 10:44.049
>> What-What's that?

10:44.049 --> 10:44.784
>> What gesture?

10:44.784 --> 10:45.419
(blows raspberry)

10:45.419 --> 10:46.521
>> Please, Mr. Spazanelli, do

10:46.521 --> 10:47.857
not go... (blows raspberry)

10:47.857 --> 10:48.792
>> But you asked him what...

10:48.792 --> 10:49.828
(blowing raspberries)

10:49.828 --> 10:50.797
>> I just asked you not to go...

10:50.797 --> 10:51.499
>> Oh, you know what it is?

10:51.499 --> 10:52.367
It's this... Uh...!

10:52.367 --> 10:53.236
>> Please do not go "uh..."

10:53.236 --> 10:54.138
>> She doesn't care about

10:54.138 --> 10:55.140
the "uh..."

10:55.140 --> 10:56.309
>> But you can't do a "uh..."

10:56.309 --> 10:57.244
without a... (blows raspberry)

10:57.244 --> 10:58.479
>> Well, then, don't do "uh..."

10:58.479 --> 11:00.016
so then you won't have to...

11:00.016 --> 11:01.018
>> You know, what we did before

11:01.018 --> 11:02.155
was this...

11:02.155 --> 11:03.190
(blowing raspberries)

11:03.190 --> 11:04.259
>> Okay, okay, that's absolutely

11:04.259 --> 11:05.261
disgusting.

11:05.261 --> 11:06.296
>> That's why we're brothers.

11:06.296 --> 11:07.265
>> Let's all do it together.

11:07.265 --> 11:08.268
>> Nobody's gonna be doing it

11:08.268 --> 11:09.070
together.

11:09.070 --> 11:09.937
>> Doing what?

11:09.937 --> 11:10.472
(blows raspberry)

11:10.472 --> 11:12.209
>> Okay, enough!

11:12.209 --> 11:13.512
Now, because you two have broken

11:13.512 --> 11:15.082
the rules today, it seems your

11:15.082 --> 11:16.218
friends are gonna have to pay.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.220
>> What do you mean?

16:56.712 --> 16:57.714
It's so hard!

16:57.714 --> 16:58.716
>> Great job, man.

16:58.716 --> 16:59.684
>> Thanks, man.

16:59.684 --> 17:00.686
>> The rope is so hard!

17:00.686 --> 17:01.321
>> Great work.

17:01.321 --> 17:01.822
>> Yeah.

17:01.822 --> 17:02.858
>> The reaction we're getting is

17:02.858 --> 17:03.626
fantastic.

17:03.626 --> 17:04.360
>> I know.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.296
That guy is jerking off so hard

17:05.296 --> 17:05.897
right now.

17:05.897 --> 17:06.866
>> You did a great job directing

17:06.866 --> 17:07.601
this.

17:07.601 --> 17:08.770
>> Thanks, man.

17:08.770 --> 17:12.445
(grunts)

17:12.445 --> 17:13.614
Is it in?

17:13.614 --> 17:14.850
>> Is it in?

17:14.850 --> 17:15.618
>> Yeah.

17:15.618 --> 17:16.386
>> You really got that whole

17:16.386 --> 17:17.188
thing in your ass, man.

17:17.188 --> 17:17.890
>> Thanks, man.

17:17.890 --> 17:18.892
>> Good job.

17:18.892 --> 17:20.696
>> Hey, Spazanelli, great work.

17:20.696 --> 17:22.399
>> Call me Spaz. Call me Spaz.

17:22.399 --> 17:23.903
>> I like that.

17:23.903 --> 17:25.272
>> In my face...

17:25.272 --> 17:25.974
>> Get the machine!

17:25.974 --> 17:28.713
>> This machine?

17:28.713 --> 17:29.815
>> Yeah.

17:29.815 --> 17:30.817
That machine.

17:30.817 --> 17:31.887
>> We should 100% do this for a

17:31.887 --> 17:32.487
living.

17:32.487 --> 17:33.356
>> 'Cause we love it and we're

17:33.356 --> 17:33.797
great at it.

17:33.797 --> 17:35.226
>> Whoa... (laughing)

17:35.226 --> 17:36.496
>> What's going on in here?

17:36.496 --> 17:38.600
Settle down... oh, Jesus Christ.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.536
Stop it! Calm down.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.371
Somebody turn that off!

17:40.371 --> 17:41.006
>> We should get going, guys.

17:41.006 --> 17:42.342
>> Yeah, we should get going.

17:42.342 --> 17:43.711
>> Let's go.

17:43.711 --> 17:45.315
>> Get-get against the wall.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.317
Get him over there.

17:46.317 --> 17:47.519
>> Will you put it back in?

17:47.519 --> 17:49.290
>> It's in there.

17:49.290 --> 17:50.359
Jesus.

17:50.359 --> 17:51.528
>> Oh, is it?

17:51.528 --> 17:52.530
>> Come here, come here!

17:52.530 --> 17:53.867
>> I'm so beautiful.

17:53.867 --> 17:55.637
>> Somebody turn that off!

17:55.637 --> 17:57.608
>> Shock him. Shock, shock.

17:57.608 --> 17:59.579
Not sure who that is, but shock

17:59.579 --> 18:01.951
them definitely.

18:01.951 --> 18:05.792
Sho... Actually... No, do sho...

18:05.792 --> 18:07.830
Yeah, don't shock him.

18:07.830 --> 18:08.832
You know what?

18:08.832 --> 18:11.404
Shock him. Who cares?

18:14.444 --> 18:16.414
>> Thank you, Spaz!

18:21.292 --> 18:22.929
>> Whoa! Your lunch box!

18:22.929 --> 18:24.532
(gasps)

18:24.532 --> 18:27.972
>> My lunch box!

18:27.972 --> 18:29.276
>> This is turning out to be the

18:29.276 --> 18:30.278
best day ever.

18:30.278 --> 18:31.280
That's nice.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.315
>> All right, let me check.

18:32.315 --> 18:33.351
>> Yeah, visiting hours are

18:33.351 --> 18:34.353
until 8:30.

18:34.353 --> 18:35.355
>> Shit! There's two orderlies

18:35.355 --> 18:36.357
at the front desk.

18:36.357 --> 18:38.361
>> What are we gonna do?

18:38.361 --> 18:39.363
>> Damn it!

18:39.363 --> 18:40.366
What are we gonna do?

18:40.366 --> 18:41.368
>> Nothing! We're screwed!

18:41.368 --> 18:42.370
There's nothing we can do!

18:42.370 --> 18:43.372
We've come all this way for

18:43.372 --> 18:44.374
nothing!

18:44.374 --> 18:45.376
>> No, wait!

18:45.376 --> 18:46.378
I'll distract the guards...

18:46.378 --> 18:47.380
two, three, four.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.383
>> But then you'll be stuck in

18:48.383 --> 18:49.452
this place forever.

18:49.452 --> 18:50.454
>> You won't be able to escape.

18:50.454 --> 18:51.756
>> I have all I need.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.594
My numbers-- two, three, four.

18:53.594 --> 18:56.334
And my lunch box!

18:56.334 --> 18:57.602
>> Aw, gross!

18:57.602 --> 18:58.604
>> Anyone want a bite?

18:58.604 --> 18:59.606
>> No! No!

18:59.606 --> 19:01.912
(all gagging and retching)

19:01.912 --> 19:03.449
>> I'll take care of it.

19:03.449 --> 19:05.486
Me and my lunch box.

19:05.486 --> 19:06.789
>> No!

19:06.789 --> 19:09.562
(groaning)

19:09.562 --> 19:11.332
>> No problem.

19:11.332 --> 19:13.336
You're welcome.

19:13.336 --> 19:15.374
>> Hi!

19:15.374 --> 19:16.543
>> William, you know you're not

19:16.543 --> 19:17.545
supposed to be down here!

19:17.545 --> 19:18.547
>> Guess what number I'm

19:18.547 --> 19:19.549
thinking of.

19:19.549 --> 19:20.551
>> I don't care what number

19:20.551 --> 19:21.553
you're thinking of...

19:21.553 --> 19:23.090
>> Five! (laughs)

19:23.090 --> 19:24.494
Three, two, four, one, four,

19:24.494 --> 19:26.030
three, lunch box, lunch box!

19:26.030 --> 19:28.001
>> Come back here, you!

19:33.613 --> 19:34.615
>> It's locked!

19:34.615 --> 19:35.617
>> Raf, put in the code!

19:35.617 --> 19:36.619
Put in the code!

19:36.619 --> 19:37.622
>> What? I don't know the code.

19:37.622 --> 19:38.624
Where's Greg?

19:38.624 --> 19:39.626
Greg knows the code.

19:39.626 --> 19:40.628
>> Who's Greg?

19:40.628 --> 19:41.630
>> Greg-- black guy with great

19:41.630 --> 19:42.632
ideas, he's part of our gang?

19:42.632 --> 19:43.634
>> What?

19:43.634 --> 19:44.637
>> Oh, I'm sorry.

19:44.637 --> 19:45.639
The African-American guy!

19:45.639 --> 19:46.641
Now is not the time to be

19:46.641 --> 19:47.643
politically correct, Randy!

19:47.643 --> 19:48.645
>> You actually think there's a

19:48.645 --> 19:49.647
black guy that's part of our

19:49.647 --> 19:50.649
group? That's why you keep

19:50.649 --> 19:51.752
saying the N-word!

19:51.752 --> 19:52.787
>> Yes, I do because he says it,

19:52.787 --> 19:53.889
then I say it 'cause I want to

19:53.889 --> 19:54.925
be cool with him!

19:54.925 --> 19:55.927
>> There's no patient named Greg

19:55.927 --> 19:57.063
in this facility.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.165
>> Come on! What?!

19:58.165 --> 20:00.002
Oh, wait, no, Greg! Greg!

20:00.002 --> 20:01.038
What's the code?

20:01.038 --> 20:02.040
>> Sorry, buddy.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.076
This is the end of our journey.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.045
>> There's no one there.

20:04.045 --> 20:05.047
You're not talking to anyone.

20:05.047 --> 20:06.049
>> Oh, no!

20:06.049 --> 20:07.051
>> Here they come.

20:07.051 --> 20:08.053
>> Hey, get away from that door!

20:08.053 --> 20:09.055
>> Get away from that door!

20:09.055 --> 20:10.057
>> What?!

20:10.057 --> 20:11.060
>> No! No!

20:11.060 --> 20:12.062
>> Are you serious?!

20:12.062 --> 20:13.064
>> No!

20:13.064 --> 20:14.433
>> Come on, man! Not cool!

20:14.433 --> 20:15.903
No!

20:15.903 --> 20:17.607
>> Rafael, Randall!

20:17.607 --> 20:18.943
>> Get off of me!

20:18.943 --> 20:20.012
>> Both of you are gonna start

20:20.012 --> 20:21.481
paying for your actions.

20:21.481 --> 20:22.484
And there's gonna be major

20:22.484 --> 20:24.087
consequences starting now!

20:24.087 --> 20:25.123
>> Ooh!

20:25.123 --> 20:26.459
>> A little electroshock?

20:26.459 --> 20:27.461
>> I could use a tune-up.

20:27.461 --> 20:28.463
>> Both of you have exceeded the

20:28.463 --> 20:29.466
state limit for electroshock

20:29.466 --> 20:30.468
therapy.

20:30.468 --> 20:31.470
>> Awesome!

20:31.470 --> 20:32.472
>> Nice!

20:32.472 --> 20:33.474
>> You've both been scheduled

20:33.474 --> 20:34.709
for lobotomies tomorrow morning.

20:34.709 --> 20:35.946
>> What?

20:35.946 --> 20:36.915
>> What? What?

20:36.915 --> 20:38.418
>> No. You can't do that!

20:38.418 --> 20:39.420
The brain's the biggest

20:39.420 --> 20:40.422
erogenous zone.

20:40.422 --> 20:41.424
>> It's done.

20:41.424 --> 20:42.426
>> What? No!

20:42.426 --> 20:43.428
>> It's-it's done?! When?!

20:43.428 --> 20:44.431
While I was sleeping?

20:44.431 --> 20:45.700
>> No, I mean, it's done as in

20:45.700 --> 20:47.671
it's, it's definitely happening.

20:47.671 --> 20:48.739
>> Okay, okay.

20:48.739 --> 20:49.742
>> It's scheduled.

20:49.742 --> 20:50.744
>> That's bad.

20:50.744 --> 20:51.746
>> Wait, wait.

20:51.746 --> 20:53.217
I know how to get out of this

20:53.217 --> 20:54.852
lobotomy.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.724
Watch this.

20:56.724 --> 20:58.060
I'd like to check myself out of

20:58.060 --> 20:59.730
this facility, please.

20:59.730 --> 21:00.732
(laughs)

21:00.732 --> 21:01.867
>> Wait, what?

21:01.867 --> 21:03.238
>> I'm here voluntarily.

21:03.238 --> 21:05.475
>> What? What does that mean?

21:05.475 --> 21:07.580
>> You know, the state would

21:07.580 --> 21:09.084
really prefer you stay here for

21:09.084 --> 21:10.152
further treatment.

21:10.152 --> 21:11.154
>> You mean get lobotomized like

21:11.154 --> 21:12.457
this idiot?

21:12.457 --> 21:13.593
No, thank you.

21:13.593 --> 21:14.862
I need my brain.

21:14.862 --> 21:16.132
>> Okay, then there's just a few

21:16.132 --> 21:17.167
forms I'm gonna need to sign

21:17.167 --> 21:18.203
before you go if you wouldn't

21:18.203 --> 21:19.205
mind.

21:19.205 --> 21:20.207
>> Okay, yeah, no problem.

21:20.207 --> 21:21.477
>> You can't do this!

21:21.477 --> 21:22.545
>> And your address right there.

21:22.545 --> 21:23.547
>> Oh, uh, you know, for now,

21:23.547 --> 21:24.549
I'm just gonna put "under a

21:24.549 --> 21:25.551
bridge."

21:25.551 --> 21:26.855
>> Works for me. Thank you.

21:26.855 --> 21:27.890
>> Thank you.

21:27.890 --> 21:28.925
>> Wait, what are you doing,

21:28.925 --> 21:30.028
Ra-Randy, what are you doing?

21:30.028 --> 21:31.031
>> Before I go, I got to tell

21:31.031 --> 21:32.600
you something.

21:32.600 --> 21:33.936
>> I love you, too.

21:33.936 --> 21:34.938
>> That's not what I was gonna

21:34.938 --> 21:35.940
tell you.

21:35.940 --> 21:36.942
>> Okay.

21:36.942 --> 21:37.878
>> I killed your family.

21:37.878 --> 21:38.646
>> Wha-what?!

21:38.646 --> 21:39.615
>> Okay, I didn't technically

21:39.615 --> 21:40.550
kill your family, but the guy

21:40.550 --> 21:41.552
who did fall on your family and

21:41.552 --> 21:42.555
squished them...

21:42.555 --> 21:43.524
>> The falling man?!

21:43.524 --> 21:44.526
>> Oh, yeah!

21:44.526 --> 21:45.528
I killed him by accident.

21:45.528 --> 21:46.530
>> You-you made the falling man

21:46.530 --> 21:47.532
fall?!

21:47.532 --> 21:48.935
>> Man, look, you got it easy.

21:48.935 --> 21:49.937
I got to walk through life

21:49.937 --> 21:50.939
remembering all this shit.

21:50.939 --> 21:51.941
You're gonna have that part of

21:51.941 --> 21:52.943
your brain taken out of your

21:52.943 --> 21:53.946
head tomorrow.

21:53.946 --> 21:54.948
>> I want my brain and I want to

21:54.948 --> 21:55.950
be best friends with you for the

21:55.950 --> 21:57.052
rest of time!

21:57.052 --> 21:58.121
>> I can't be best friends with

21:58.121 --> 21:59.156
a brainless idiot, I mean...

21:59.156 --> 22:00.193
>> I get it. You're cool.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.195
>> I'll leave you with these

22:01.195 --> 22:02.197
words-- I'll see you on

22:02.197 --> 22:03.767
the flippity-flop.

22:03.767 --> 22:04.769
All right, nice meeting

22:04.769 --> 22:05.771
you guys.

22:05.771 --> 22:06.773
>> Cool beans, man.

22:06.773 --> 22:07.775
Super cool beans.

22:07.775 --> 22:08.777
>> Yeah, yeah, super cool.

22:08.777 --> 22:09.780
All right, oh!

22:09.780 --> 22:10.782
>> You're a great guy.

22:10.782 --> 22:11.784
Too slow.

22:11.784 --> 22:12.786
>> That was awkward!

22:12.786 --> 22:14.289
Cool, cool.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.592
>> Why is everybody getting

22:15.592 --> 22:16.828
along so well?!

22:16.828 --> 22:18.732
No! Randy, no!

22:18.732 --> 22:21.938
No! No, Randy!

22:21.938 --> 22:24.110
Don't leave me!

22:27.918 --> 22:28.953
>> So, in order to perform a

22:28.953 --> 22:31.659
successful lobotomy, one needs a

22:31.659 --> 22:34.098
giant nail and a teeny, teeny

22:34.098 --> 22:35.802
little baby hammer.

22:35.802 --> 22:37.071
>> Are those medical terms?

22:37.071 --> 22:39.075
>> And then you press the giant

22:39.075 --> 22:40.746
nail right next to the ear lobe.

22:40.746 --> 22:41.748
>> Wait, what are you doing?

22:41.748 --> 22:42.750
No, you don't! That's not how

22:42.750 --> 22:43.819
you do a lobotomy.

22:43.819 --> 22:44.821
A lobotomy you go in through the

22:44.821 --> 22:45.824
nostril.

22:45.824 --> 22:46.826
>> I'm doing an ear lobotomy.

22:46.826 --> 22:47.828
>> There is no such thing as an

22:47.828 --> 22:48.830
ear lobotomy.

22:48.830 --> 22:49.832
>> I'll do a throat lobotomy.

22:49.832 --> 22:50.800
>> There's no brain in the

22:50.800 --> 22:51.802
throat.

22:51.802 --> 22:52.804
>> I've done anal lobotomies.

22:52.804 --> 22:53.941
>> Okay, I'm listening.

22:53.941 --> 22:54.943
>> But if you want a nasal

22:54.943 --> 22:56.178
lobotomy, that's pretty out

22:56.178 --> 22:57.214
there stuff, but I'm willing to

22:57.214 --> 22:58.250
give it a try.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.221
>> Wait, now?

23:05.332 --> 23:07.369
>> I'm coming for you, Rafi.

23:10.375 --> 23:11.745
(grunting)

23:11.745 --> 23:14.852
>> This is gonna be real gross.

23:14.852 --> 23:15.988
Say good-bye to your thoughts,

23:15.988 --> 23:17.123
your dreams and your hopes for

23:17.123 --> 23:18.292
the future.

23:18.292 --> 23:20.264
>> What?

23:23.303 --> 23:24.272
Yeah!

23:24.272 --> 23:25.274
>> What the hell?!

23:25.274 --> 23:26.277
(grunts)

23:26.277 --> 23:27.279
>> I'm here to rescue him!

23:27.279 --> 23:28.281
>> You're too late.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.283
>> Let's go, homie!

23:29.283 --> 23:30.285
>> Yeah!

23:30.285 --> 23:32.055
(both grunting)

23:32.055 --> 23:33.057
>> You okay?

23:33.057 --> 23:34.059
>> Yeah!

23:34.059 --> 23:35.062
>> Did they lobotomize you?

23:35.062 --> 23:36.064
>> I don't know.

23:36.064 --> 23:37.333
Oh, looks like a little bit.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.670
>> Will you ever be able to

23:38.670 --> 23:39.672
forgive me for what I did to

23:39.672 --> 23:40.840
your family?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.110
>> What family?

23:42.110 --> 23:44.014
>> Works for me.

23:44.014 --> 23:45.885
>> Security!

23:45.885 --> 23:47.855
(both laughing)

23:50.294 --> 23:51.898
>> Hey, look!

23:51.898 --> 23:53.000
>> Whoa! Whoa!

23:53.000 --> 23:54.770
>> Guys! Nice!

23:54.770 --> 23:57.242
>> Keep that safe for me, Joely.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.351
Looks like we're getting out of

24:01.351 --> 24:02.821
here.

24:02.821 --> 24:03.823
>> I really did see you on the

24:03.823 --> 24:04.958
flippity-flop.

24:04.958 --> 24:06.362
(laughs)

24:06.362 --> 24:10.103
(both yell)

24:10.103 --> 24:11.773
No!

24:11.773 --> 24:12.775
Oh, Rafi!

24:12.775 --> 24:13.911
Wake up!

24:13.911 --> 24:15.447
Oh, man, he's dead!

24:15.447 --> 24:17.953
I killed my best friend again!

24:17.953 --> 24:20.325
Oh, God!

24:20.325 --> 24:22.062
>> Rafi!

24:22.062 --> 24:23.064
(gasps)

24:23.064 --> 24:24.801
No!

24:24.801 --> 24:26.070
>> Rebecca Ruxin?!

24:26.070 --> 24:27.340
>> No! What happened?

24:27.340 --> 24:29.077
Rafi! What happened to him?

24:29.077 --> 24:30.079
>> Oh, Randy murdered him with

24:30.079 --> 24:31.048
his gun.

24:31.048 --> 24:32.050
>> Come on, dude!

24:32.050 --> 24:33.052
>> You animals!

24:33.052 --> 24:34.321
Don't you leave me!

24:34.321 --> 24:36.059
Don't you leave me!

24:36.059 --> 24:37.461
Not today, my prince!

24:37.461 --> 24:39.165
Not today! Here, here!

24:39.165 --> 24:40.835
Let these guide you back.

24:40.835 --> 24:42.338
Let these guide you back.

24:42.338 --> 24:43.742
Don't go to the light.

24:43.742 --> 24:44.744
Come back to me....

24:44.744 --> 24:45.344
Let them g...

24:45.344 --> 24:46.748
(gasps)

24:46.748 --> 24:49.253
(grunts)

24:49.253 --> 24:50.489
Are you okay?

24:50.489 --> 24:53.796
>> I am now that you're here.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.300
It's a mitzvah.

24:55.300 --> 24:56.870
>> Yes.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.909
It is a mitzvah.

25:01.813 --> 25:03.350
>> We are gathered here today to

25:03.350 --> 25:06.891
join Rebecca and Rafi together

25:06.891 --> 25:09.296
in holy matrimony.

25:09.296 --> 25:11.467
>> Congratulations, my friend.

25:11.467 --> 25:12.503
>> Thanks, man.

25:12.503 --> 25:13.505
>> JENNY: Rafi looks so

25:13.505 --> 25:14.240
handsome.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.476
>> ANDRE: Where's Ruxin?

25:15.476 --> 25:16.478
>> PETE: Not invited.

25:16.478 --> 25:17.781
>> If anyone has any objection

25:17.781 --> 25:18.849
why this man and woman

25:18.849 --> 25:20.153
should not be joined in holy

25:20.153 --> 25:22.157
matrimony, speak now or forever

25:22.157 --> 25:24.228
hold your peace.

25:24.228 --> 25:25.798
>> I have something I have to

25:25.798 --> 25:28.771
say!

25:28.771 --> 25:30.875
You cannot get married.

25:30.875 --> 25:33.548
Not without your best man.

25:33.548 --> 25:35.151
>> Hey, Brian, take a hike, you

25:35.151 --> 25:36.320
dumb dildo.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.289
>> KEVIN: Thank Christ.

25:37.289 --> 25:38.292
>> You got a lot of nerve

25:38.292 --> 25:39.294
showing up here.

25:39.294 --> 25:40.296
>> I got to ask you something,

25:40.296 --> 25:41.298
big man.

25:41.298 --> 25:42.300
>> I'm listening.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.302
>> Can you forgive me for what I

25:43.302 --> 25:45.005
did-- smushing your family and

25:45.005 --> 25:48.112
shooting you?

25:48.112 --> 25:49.181
>> I do.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.152
(short laugh)

25:53.424 --> 25:54.926
>> Wow.

25:54.926 --> 25:56.029
>> I made these from the bullet

25:56.029 --> 25:57.298
I shot you with.

25:57.298 --> 25:58.300
Now, go make an honest Jew out

25:58.300 --> 25:59.370
of her.

25:59.370 --> 26:02.309
>> I plan on it.

26:02.309 --> 26:03.511
>> And with the placing of these

26:03.511 --> 26:05.850
rings, I now pronounce you man

26:05.850 --> 26:08.021
and wife!

26:08.021 --> 26:10.093
You may kiss the bride.

26:10.093 --> 26:12.464
(all cheering)

26:12.464 --> 26:14.101
>> Congrats, Rafi!

26:14.101 --> 26:16.439
>> Get up! Rafi, Rafi, get up,

26:16.439 --> 26:18.410
you big idiot!

26:20.582 --> 26:23.821
Rafi, Rafi!

26:23.821 --> 26:24.823
Rafi!

26:24.823 --> 26:26.594
(gasping)

26:29.033 --> 26:30.035
>> I can't believe mouth to

26:30.035 --> 26:31.171
mouth worked.

26:31.171 --> 26:32.307
>> That wasn't mouth to mouth.

26:32.307 --> 26:34.210
>> That was true love's kiss.

26:34.210 --> 26:36.349
You saved my life.

26:36.349 --> 26:37.584
>> I'll never do anything to

26:37.584 --> 26:39.890
hurt you ever again.

26:39.890 --> 26:42.629
Where'd you get that?

26:42.629 --> 26:44.266
>> Don't worry about it.

26:44.266 --> 26:45.268
(gunshot)

26:45.268 --> 26:46.270
>> Oh!

26:46.270 --> 26:47.272
>> Ah, turns out it is still

26:47.272 --> 26:48.640
loaded, guys. My bad.
