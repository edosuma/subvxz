WEBVTT

02:19.512 --> 02:20.544
Shane!

04:36.110 --> 04:37.615
Son of a bitch.

04:38.618 --> 04:39.815
Where is he?

04:52.962 --> 04:55.699
Relax.
Bet that's him.

05:06.679 --> 05:10.912
Late on his first day.
The balls on this fuckin' guy.

05:15.919 --> 05:17.622
Hi, there.

05:17.657 --> 05:22.121
Special Agent Justin Rosa.
Here for wire room duty.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.123
Got an ID,
Special Agent?

05:25.192 --> 05:26.598
Yes, I do.

05:27.601 --> 05:29.403
Let's take a look at that.

05:32.001 --> 05:34.936
Well, you're
definitely not new.

05:34.971 --> 05:36.443
How can you tell?

05:37.545 --> 05:38.841
Your photo.

05:38.876 --> 05:40.909
I'm guessing that's what,
20 years ago?

05:42.451 --> 05:45.683
Good eye, 18.
But thanks for noticing.

05:45.718 --> 05:47.916
Well, I can tell there's
a good story here,

05:47.951 --> 05:52.459
but, uh, considering
you're about ten minutes
late for your shift,

05:52.494 --> 05:53.988
guess you'll have to fill me in
some other time.

05:54.023 --> 05:55.891
- Yeah. Will do, will do.
- Know where you're goin'?

05:55.926 --> 05:57.629
- Fourth floor, right?
- Got it.

05:58.929 --> 06:00.830
Friday night's
slow around here.

06:00.865 --> 06:02.062
Let us know
if you need something.

06:02.097 --> 06:04.570
- I will. Thank you.
- All right.

06:26.957 --> 06:28.957
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I couldn't find any--

06:28.992 --> 06:30.431
I didn't ask.

06:32.127 --> 06:34.468
Shut the door.

06:34.503 --> 06:35.799
That's rule number one.

06:36.934 --> 06:38.505
Okay. Okay.

06:50.948 --> 06:52.046
Hi, there.

06:54.215 --> 06:56.589
I'm Agent Justin Rosa.
How you doin'?

06:56.624 --> 07:00.186
Don't talk to her.
She's busy.

07:00.221 --> 07:03.596
You must be
Special Agent Mueller.
I'm your new transfer.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.095
It's Senior Special Agent.

07:08.997 --> 07:12.869
I know who you are,
and I know what you are.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.906
Eh, look, I'm sorry I'm late.

07:16.941 --> 07:18.842
I don't have access
to the garage yet.

07:18.877 --> 07:21.141
I had to park
like six blocks away.

07:21.176 --> 07:24.111
Who knew downtown
could get so busy on a Friday?

07:24.146 --> 07:26.014
Yeah, no shit.

07:26.049 --> 07:28.555
No excuses.
You're not allowed.

07:30.790 --> 07:33.252
Understood.
Understood.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.255
Yeah, you look
a little old...
for a rookie.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.599
Yeah. I started out
in Secret Service.

07:39.634 --> 07:42.030
But to be honest with you,
it was a little boring.

07:42.065 --> 07:45.099
I wanted a little more action,
so I figured I'd try this.

07:45.134 --> 07:48.135
Action? Yeah,
there is no action.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.809
Well, I've never been
in a wire room before,

07:51.844 --> 07:54.108
but if this is
what one looks like,

07:54.143 --> 07:57.914
then, uh, you guys must have
a pretty good case. Huh?

07:57.949 --> 07:59.179
It's a shit case.

08:01.656 --> 08:04.624
- You know
what a wire room is?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:04.659 --> 08:06.186
You want
the textbook definition?

08:06.221 --> 08:09.255
- Sure.
- Yeah, a wire is
a lawful interception

08:09.290 --> 08:12.324
of telephonic and internet
based conversations

08:12.359 --> 08:15.734
of subjects
under criminal investigation.

08:15.769 --> 08:17.263
You memorized
this whole thing?

08:17.298 --> 08:20.068
Yeah, I did, yeah.
From that little pamphlet.

08:21.676 --> 08:23.676
Your knowledge
doesn't matter.

08:23.711 --> 08:24.875
You want to know why?

08:24.910 --> 08:27.207
Uh, let me guess,
one of your rules?

08:27.242 --> 08:28.307
Nope.

08:29.618 --> 08:32.146
Why doesn't matter?
Tell him.

08:32.181 --> 08:34.313
Because you are nothing more
than a warm body here

08:34.348 --> 08:36.656
to make sure the place
doesn't burn down.

08:38.022 --> 08:39.560
Exactly.

08:42.895 --> 08:44.290
Don't fuck anything up.

08:46.063 --> 08:47.359
What, so that's it?

08:47.394 --> 08:49.328
You're not gonna
brief me on the case?

08:49.363 --> 08:53.233
It's a gun-smuggling case
with the cartel.

08:53.268 --> 08:54.467
- Which one?
- Does that matter?

08:54.503 --> 08:57.974
Well, yeah, 'cause if we're
talking about the Baja cartel,

08:58.009 --> 09:01.010
they control
all the smuggling routes
in and out of California.

09:01.045 --> 09:03.243
So if that's the one
you're talking about,
then we're good.

09:05.654 --> 09:08.347
Yeah, well, maybe
you're not a complete idiot.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.252
The Baja cartel.

09:13.827 --> 09:16.091
This is our guy.

09:16.126 --> 09:17.994
That's Eddie Flynn.

09:18.029 --> 09:19.864
That's Eddie Flynn, huh?

09:19.899 --> 09:20.964
That's him.

09:20.999 --> 09:23.802
- Huh, this guy right here?
- Yep.

09:29.205 --> 09:32.239
So this is
what a shit case
looks like, huh?

09:32.274 --> 09:34.945
- If you ask me,

09:34.980 --> 09:39.752
it looks like someone put
a lot of hard work
and money into this.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.183
And that is
just unbelievable.

09:42.218 --> 09:45.021
That's your entertainment.
She's the expert.

09:46.387 --> 09:48.992
I'm the expert on all of it.

09:49.027 --> 09:53.161
So, these screens
are tied into two sets
of CCTVs--

09:53.196 --> 09:57.066
one for the federal building
and these are
from Eddie's compound.

09:57.101 --> 10:00.069
We have most of the inside
and all of the outside
monitored.

10:00.104 --> 10:03.776
So he can't take a shit
without us knowing the color.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.437
- It's brown.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.747
Each camera is recorded
to a hard drive,

10:07.782 --> 10:10.178
that way you can
rewind, pause.

10:10.213 --> 10:12.378
You ever see anything
good on there?

10:12.413 --> 10:13.852
Nope.

10:13.887 --> 10:16.756
Just like the wire.
<i>Nada.</i>

10:18.760 --> 10:22.058
Who knows?
Yeah, maybe you'll get lucky.

10:22.093 --> 10:25.391
Yeah, get
some actual activity.

10:25.426 --> 10:28.702
However, we never
turn the channels off
of Eddie's CCTVs.

10:28.737 --> 10:31.265
They are triggered
by facial recognition tech.

10:31.300 --> 10:32.166
Impressive.

10:32.201 --> 10:35.775
Don't get too excited.
It's worthless.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.174
And that's about it
for the TVs.

10:39.209 --> 10:44.883
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd really like to get back
to my actual job.

10:44.918 --> 10:48.117
Can I go, or do you have
more questions for me?

10:48.152 --> 10:52.990
Um, what if I want to leave?
If I gotta, you know,
go pee or something?

10:53.025 --> 10:54.090
You don't.

10:54.125 --> 10:55.487
That's rule number two.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.763
Well, what are the other rules?

10:56.798 --> 11:00.327
You're a real
special agent now, huh?

11:00.362 --> 11:01.834
Yeah, you'll figure it out.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.422
Uh, the rest
are in the blue binder.

11:29.457 --> 11:31.765
- Okay. All right.
- Read 'em.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.833
Nour Holborow, the analyst
assigned to the case.

11:33.868 --> 11:34.933
Hi, Nour.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.870
Well, that
went well, huh?

11:37.905 --> 11:39.267
- Don't let him get to you.

11:39.302 --> 11:40.466
He's three months
from retirement.

11:40.501 --> 11:42.237
He's not always
that friendly?

11:42.272 --> 11:45.306
Shane? He used to be one
of the coolest agents around.

11:45.341 --> 11:47.473
- Oh, yeah?
- Fun-loving,
laid back, charming.

11:47.508 --> 11:50.344
One of the best.
Fucking rock star.

11:50.379 --> 11:51.851
What happened?

11:51.886 --> 11:53.952
Well, it started
as a swan song, you know.

11:53.987 --> 11:55.118
One last case
to hang his hat on,

11:55.153 --> 11:57.318
but didn't quite
turn out that way.

11:57.353 --> 12:00.057
And now he's just trying
to make it these last
few months,

12:00.092 --> 12:01.993
so he can collect
his pension,
call it a career.

12:02.028 --> 12:04.490
So is this case that bad?

12:04.525 --> 12:06.965
I mean, it had legs
early on.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.527
Shane had a CI
in the organization

12:08.562 --> 12:10.331
who was feeding us great intel,

12:10.366 --> 12:14.104
but he went dark
several months ago.

12:14.139 --> 12:15.369
Is that normal?

12:15.404 --> 12:19.142
Mm, there's nothing normal
about CIs.

12:19.177 --> 12:21.441
Anyhoo, Eddie Flynn

12:21.476 --> 12:23.850
is an infamous
Irish arms dealer.

12:25.084 --> 12:26.083
Smuggled Russian-made weapons

12:26.119 --> 12:28.855
into shipments bound
for the South American rebels.

12:28.890 --> 12:30.989
Ended up on the run
after a bloody gang war.

12:31.024 --> 12:32.223
Made his way to the US.

12:32.259 --> 12:35.895
And now is biding his time
as a middleman
for the Baja cartel.

12:35.930 --> 12:39.866
- Ah.
- Still using his arms and dope
connections to survive.

12:39.901 --> 12:42.935
And that is his number two,

12:42.970 --> 12:46.301
who we've yet to identify
other than a nickname
of Junior.

12:46.336 --> 12:47.973
Junior.

12:48.008 --> 12:49.238
We tracked
a few of their shipments,

12:49.273 --> 12:52.846
but once the CI disappeared
so did the guns,

12:52.881 --> 12:55.541
and it's been quiet
here ever since.

12:55.576 --> 12:57.378
Nothing but a bunch
of coded talk

12:57.413 --> 13:00.854
and calls to numbers that drop
the moment they hang up.

13:00.889 --> 13:02.449
Eleven wasted months.

13:04.585 --> 13:08.125
All right, let me show you
how everything works
so I can get out of here.

13:10.195 --> 13:13.900
So, program is always on.

13:13.935 --> 13:16.298
And you'll know
someone is either making
or receiving a call

13:16.333 --> 13:18.168
- when you hear three beeps...
- Yeah. Three beeps.

13:18.203 --> 13:20.434
...and a dial tone.
Once the call connects,

13:20.469 --> 13:22.942
it will play in real time.

13:22.977 --> 13:28.079
And here is the audio waveform
visualizer, or AWV.

13:28.114 --> 13:30.444
It's basically
a computer-generated image
of the audio recording.

13:30.479 --> 13:32.347
Okay.

13:32.382 --> 13:35.020
But for today, you won't need
to worry about any of that.

13:36.584 --> 13:38.254
Eddie doesn't make calls
before midnight.

13:39.521 --> 13:42.126
A criminal
with a schedule.
I like it.

13:42.161 --> 13:44.392
Ah. And if a call
does come in,

13:44.427 --> 13:46.625
the program automatically
records and stores it

13:46.660 --> 13:49.199
for review
and evidentiary purposes.

13:49.234 --> 13:54.171
So nothing to do
but count the minutes
until shift change.

13:54.206 --> 13:55.403
Completely agent-proof.

13:55.438 --> 13:56.602
All right.

13:56.637 --> 14:00.012
Speaking of shift change...

14:02.511 --> 14:06.249
- Think you got it?
- Yeah, it's completely
agent-proof.

14:06.284 --> 14:09.021
- What could go wrong?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.957
Good luck,
Special Agent Rosa.

14:12.026 --> 14:13.927
Thank you, Nour.

14:13.962 --> 14:15.489
- Good night.
- Have a good night.

14:33.509 --> 14:36.609
Senior Special Agent
Shane Mueller.

14:36.644 --> 14:38.380
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

14:39.515 --> 14:40.613
All right.

14:41.449 --> 14:44.221
Let's look at those
fucking rules, huh?

14:48.062 --> 14:51.195
"Rule one:
Keep the door closed.

14:51.230 --> 14:54.627
- Don't leave
the room unattended.

14:54.662 --> 14:58.334
- No one other than HSI
personnel are allowed in.

14:58.369 --> 15:01.271
- Don't destroy wire room.

15:01.306 --> 15:04.637
Never contact the target.

15:04.672 --> 15:07.541
Keep the target alive.

15:10.315 --> 15:13.250
- Don't fuck anything up.

15:13.285 --> 15:16.022
- If you have any issues,
questions or emergency,

15:16.057 --> 15:18.618
the only number
you should call is Shane."

15:22.789 --> 15:24.426
All right.

15:25.429 --> 15:26.626
Let's get into it.

15:26.661 --> 15:29.497
- Oh!

15:31.633 --> 15:33.402
<i> Hey, it's me.</i>

15:33.437 --> 15:37.472
<i>Yeah. Can you get me</i>
<i>the same again?</i>

15:37.507 --> 15:39.375
<i>The chicken dumpling.</i>

15:39.410 --> 15:42.147
<i>And the special sauce.</i>

15:42.182 --> 15:44.479
<i>Don't be late.</i>

15:49.816 --> 15:52.091
Eh, call before midnight.

17:24.548 --> 17:25.613
All right.

17:37.693 --> 17:38.857
Here.

18:01.618 --> 18:04.322
<i> Can't be good</i>
<i>if you're calling</i>
<i>this late, boss.</i>

18:04.357 --> 18:07.325
<i>We had to terminate</i>
<i>one of the babysitters.</i>

18:07.360 --> 18:08.960
<i>How quickly can you</i>
<i>find me another one?</i>

18:08.995 --> 18:13.529
<i> The White girl?</i>
<i> Nah,</i>
<i>the Chinese girl.</i>

18:13.564 --> 18:16.433
-<i> How quickly</i>
<i>do you need one?</i>
-<i> Quickly.</i>

18:16.468 --> 18:18.633
<i>Talk to Marsh,</i>
<i>he'll fill you in on it.</i>

18:22.342 --> 18:24.408
Why are you
dressed like that?

18:24.443 --> 18:26.311
<i> What's that, boss?</i>

18:26.346 --> 18:28.214
Not you, hold on.

18:28.249 --> 18:31.844
- What, we don't look
sexy enough?

18:31.879 --> 18:34.781
- Where do you think you're even
going dressed like that?
- Out. And you're taking us.

18:34.816 --> 18:38.191
Oh, no.
No chance, darling.

18:38.226 --> 18:42.195
<i> Please? Just today.</i>
<i>I won't ask again.</i>

18:42.230 --> 18:44.956
Right.
Until the next time.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.464
You need to take better care
of my girl.

18:47.499 --> 18:49.697
You already know me answer.

18:49.732 --> 18:52.469
- Such a prick.
- Paranoid prick.

18:54.539 --> 18:57.210
I'm getting really tired
of having to explain myself

18:57.245 --> 18:58.805
every fucking time
you talk back.

18:58.840 --> 19:03.612
Nor do I appreciate
being called prick
in me own home.

19:03.647 --> 19:05.713
Well, then
don't act like one.

19:05.748 --> 19:09.420
You always do this.
All because you think
someone wants to kill you.

19:09.455 --> 19:11.818
You're not that important.

19:11.853 --> 19:13.292
<i>Seriousl.</i>

19:14.856 --> 19:17.923
<i>You know what I do.</i>
<i>And who I am.</i>

19:19.663 --> 19:21.795
<i>This is the only place</i>
<i>I'm safe.</i>

19:23.271 --> 19:25.832
So take your sweet little asses
back upstairs,

19:25.867 --> 19:28.835
put your pajamas on,
we're staying in.

19:28.870 --> 19:29.935
I'm not.

19:31.071 --> 19:33.807
- <i> You want me</i>
<i>to call back?</i>
- Did I say I wanted you to?

19:33.842 --> 19:36.348
'Cause if I did,
I'd say so.
Hold the line.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.911
Upstairs.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.519
- Upstairs!
- Fuck that!

19:43.588 --> 19:44.620
Cindy...

19:45.854 --> 19:47.755
do I need to raise
my voice again?

19:48.857 --> 19:50.659
Go change.

19:50.694 --> 19:52.364
<i>Go upstairs.</i>

19:54.335 --> 19:56.929
<i> You know, you're right.</i>
<i>Someone does want to kill you.</i>

19:56.964 --> 19:57.963
<i>It's me!</i>

19:58.765 --> 20:02.341
I'll add you
to the damn list,
you fucking floozy!

20:04.037 --> 20:06.411
Call Ma.
Find me a babysitter.

20:12.617 --> 20:14.947
<i>What's the story?</i>

20:14.982 --> 20:17.719
This guy's life's
a fucking soap opera.

20:17.754 --> 20:21.558
<i> All right. Uh-huh.</i>
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:24.330
<i>Okay, yeah.</i>

20:26.829 --> 20:29.533
<i>What do I pay you for?</i>

20:29.568 --> 20:31.667
<i>Fucking useless.</i>

20:31.702 --> 20:32.932
Hey.

20:34.474 --> 20:37.310
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Shit.

20:37.345 --> 20:38.740
Didn't mean to scare
the piss outta you.

20:38.775 --> 20:39.906
Just doing my rounds.

20:41.646 --> 20:43.811
- Officer...
- Axum.

20:43.846 --> 20:44.845
Call me Mike.

20:44.881 --> 20:47.815
- Hey, Mike. How you doin'?
- Good. Pleasure.

20:47.850 --> 20:49.014
Yeah, pleasure's mine.

20:50.050 --> 20:54.525
You know, how is it
you've been around here
for 18 years,

20:54.560 --> 20:56.054
but I've never
seen you before?

20:58.432 --> 21:00.333
Well, there's not much
to tell, really.

21:00.368 --> 21:01.829
You know, I started out
with Secret Service

21:01.864 --> 21:04.832
and... yeah, I just thought
I'd mix it up a little bit.

21:04.867 --> 21:06.033
Yeah, no, I get that.

21:06.068 --> 21:09.639
I was a deputy
with the sheriff's department
for 20 years.

21:09.674 --> 21:10.805
- No shit.
- Yeah.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.444
Yeah, just retired
a few months ago.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.072
- Hey, congrats.
- Thank you.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.878
Took this gig here
purely out of boredom.

21:17.913 --> 21:19.748
What, this isn't boring?

21:19.783 --> 21:21.948
Well, to be perfectly honest,

21:21.983 --> 21:23.521
keeps me out of the house
a little bit

21:23.556 --> 21:25.050
between the wife
and the boys.

21:25.085 --> 21:26.458
Yeah.

21:27.890 --> 21:29.428
How about you?
You married, kids?

21:29.463 --> 21:31.925
No. Divorced.
No kids.

21:33.093 --> 21:35.566
Eh, you know
this line of work.

21:35.601 --> 21:36.765
It ain't easy.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
No, no, it's not.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.034
What kind of case
you guys working on in here?

21:42.069 --> 21:45.444
It's nothing too exciting.
Guns, drugs,
as far as I know.

21:45.479 --> 21:46.808
I'm the new guy.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.943
- Same old shit, huh?
- Yeah.

21:49.978 --> 21:52.946
Well, looks like you're busy.
Let me let you
get back to work.

21:52.981 --> 21:54.981
- All right, Mike.
- I'm gonna take care
of my rounds.

21:55.016 --> 21:56.653
- All right.
- Okay.

21:56.688 --> 21:58.655
- Hey, Mike, uh...
- Yeah.

21:58.690 --> 21:59.854
Hang on one second.

22:00.857 --> 22:01.856
What is it?

22:02.658 --> 22:04.155
Where's the bathrooms
around here?

22:04.190 --> 22:05.629
Can you show me
where they are?

22:05.664 --> 22:07.697
Yeah, let me show you.
Gets a little confusing.

22:07.732 --> 22:09.798
Prostate's gigantic nowadays.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.800
- Holy shit.
- I shoulda wore my Depends.

22:11.835 --> 22:14.638
I didn't know I was gonna be
stuck in an office all day.

22:14.673 --> 22:16.508
Come on, man,
I'll take you there.

22:16.543 --> 22:17.905
- Thanks, man.

23:10.663 --> 23:12.091
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>you put up with him.</i>

23:12.126 --> 23:15.600
I can do
better, I know.

23:23.808 --> 23:26.545
- Let me guess--
he loves you.

23:26.580 --> 23:29.141
Does he say that
when he's drunk
or sober?

23:30.782 --> 23:31.979
That's what I thought.

23:35.050 --> 23:36.885
No! No!

23:46.633 --> 23:48.699
Junior, come on.

23:48.734 --> 23:52.197
One time I need you.
You useless Yank.

23:52.232 --> 23:54.232
Where are you?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.806
<i> At the tone,</i>
<i>please record your message.</i>

23:56.841 --> 23:58.907
<i> Come down here,</i>
<i>Junior.</i>

23:58.942 --> 24:00.645
<i>Someone's come for me,</i>
<i>where are you?</i>

24:02.110 --> 24:03.483
<i>Fuck!</i>

25:05.745 --> 25:07.008
<i> Come down here,</i>
<i>Junior.</i>

25:07.043 --> 25:09.043
<i>Someone's come for me.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

25:10.849 --> 25:12.013
<i>Fuck!</i>

25:12.048 --> 25:13.949
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:57.126 --> 25:59.896
- <i> Cin, is that you?</i>
- I don't wanna die.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.295
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

26:04.364 --> 26:06.837
They have me
downstairs on the couch.

26:06.872 --> 26:09.004
<i>Okay, okay, okay. Listen...</i>

26:10.106 --> 26:13.140
<i>They're here for me, not you.</i>

26:13.175 --> 26:16.946
<i>You do whatever they say,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna come find you.</i>

26:16.981 --> 26:18.948
<i>I promise,</i>
<i>it's gonna be all right.</i>

26:18.983 --> 26:21.951
They're gonna kill me,
I know it. Please--

26:26.991 --> 26:29.728
<i> Cindy! Cindy!</i>

26:29.763 --> 26:31.191
<i>Fuck!</i>

26:32.832 --> 26:35.327
<i>Fuck. You fuckers.</i>

26:38.365 --> 26:40.068
What the fuck?

27:08.494 --> 27:10.703
- Hello.
- Shane, it's Justin.

27:10.738 --> 27:12.397
-<i> Who?</i>
- Justin. Justin Rosa.

27:12.432 --> 27:16.104
- From the wire room.
- Oh, shit.

27:16.139 --> 27:18.975
<i>- What do you want?</i>
Hey, look, Eddie already
made some phone calls.

27:19.010 --> 27:20.471
<i>- And there's--</i>
- Who did he call?

27:20.506 --> 27:22.847
Well, the first one
I don't know.

27:22.882 --> 27:24.948
Some guy about firing
the babysitter

27:24.983 --> 27:26.444
and hiring
some Chinese girl.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.248
<i>Those are code words</i>
<i>for drugs.</i>

27:28.283 --> 27:30.052
<i>Fentanyl, stash house.</i>

27:30.087 --> 27:31.856
The other two calls
went to Junior,

27:31.891 --> 27:33.385
but they went
right to voice mail.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.553
Did he leave messages?

27:34.588 --> 27:36.960
<i>Yeah, he said get some guys</i>
<i>and come to the house.</i>

27:36.995 --> 27:38.258
<i>Did you read the folder?</i>

27:41.098 --> 27:43.934
The ones the binder?
Yeah, yeah, I read the rules.

27:43.969 --> 27:47.135
-<i> Did you get it?</i>
- Yeah, they're pretty much
self-explanatory.

27:47.170 --> 27:48.268
<i>Obviously not.</i>

27:48.303 --> 27:49.841
You damn broke the last one.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.337
<i>Fucked up my day.</i>

27:51.372 --> 27:53.977
Hey, there's a bunch of guys
over there right now.

27:54.012 --> 27:56.276
- There's some kind of a seat--

27:56.311 --> 27:57.343
Hello?

28:01.921 --> 28:03.723
Fucking prick.

28:06.992 --> 28:10.862
- Looks like one
of those days, huh, Shane?
- Yeah.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.732
You need to train
hose recruits better.

28:14.131 --> 28:15.364
Tell me about it.

28:15.399 --> 28:18.463
- Well, next round
of drinks is on me.
- If you can afford it.

28:18.498 --> 28:21.202
Hefeweizen, not any
of the American slop.

28:21.237 --> 28:22.170
Deal.

28:27.243 --> 28:28.473
All right.

28:41.356 --> 28:44.357
Okay. All right,
think, Justin, think.

28:54.435 --> 28:57.436
- Hello?
<i>- Special Agent Rosa,</i>
<i>this is Nour.</i>

28:57.471 --> 28:59.878
Oh, Nour, thank God.
Hey, look, there's--

28:59.913 --> 29:01.341
<i>I think I forgot my PIF</i>
<i>there in the room.</i>

29:01.376 --> 29:02.881
<i>Could you</i>
<i>check around for it?</i>

29:05.050 --> 29:07.578
Okay, uh...
what's a PIF?

29:07.613 --> 29:10.383
<i>It's our access card</i>
<i>for the building, parking,</i>
<i>the wire room.</i>

29:10.418 --> 29:12.055
<i>And if we lose them....</i>

29:12.090 --> 29:14.420
Okay. Yeah, yeah,
I got your PIF.

29:14.455 --> 29:17.258
Hey, look, Eddie
already made
a bunch of calls.

29:17.293 --> 29:19.524
<i>- Who did he call?</i>
Look, that's not
important right now.

29:19.559 --> 29:20.932
There's a bunch of guys
in there,

29:20.967 --> 29:22.296
and they got his wife,

29:22.331 --> 29:24.837
or his girlfriend
or wherever she is,

29:24.872 --> 29:26.272
and they're looking
for him right now.

29:26.307 --> 29:30.007
I mean, these guys
are like military
or they're SWAT or something.

29:30.042 --> 29:31.041
It's hard to tell.

29:31.077 --> 29:33.439
<i>Shit, Rosa, why didn't you</i>
<i>lead with that?</i>

29:33.474 --> 29:36.244
<i>Give me a sec, I can log in</i>
<i>remotely from my laptop.</i>

29:36.279 --> 29:37.949
<i>If they are SWAT,</i>
<i>I'm gonna be pissed.</i>

29:37.984 --> 29:39.148
<i>I cleared that address.</i>

29:40.349 --> 29:42.151
<i>If any other law enforcement</i>
<i>agency runs it,</i>

29:42.186 --> 29:44.087
<i>I should have been</i>
<i>notified immediately.</i>

29:44.122 --> 29:45.451
<i>Unless they didn't</i>
<i>clear it,</i>

29:45.486 --> 29:47.453
<i>and in that case,</i>
<i>I bet it's the DEA,</i>

29:47.488 --> 29:49.928
<i>because those assholes</i>
<i>never clear shit.</i>

29:49.963 --> 29:53.063
<i>Okay, I'm logged in.</i>
<i>Let me zoom in.</i>

29:54.528 --> 29:56.231
<i>They don't look like</i>
<i>law enforcement.</i>

29:56.266 --> 29:57.870
<i>Have you notified Shane?</i>

29:57.905 --> 29:59.138
Well, I tried to.

29:59.173 --> 30:02.875
I called him, but he
hung up on me before I
could explain. Dick.

30:02.910 --> 30:04.503
<i>All right, I'm on my way</i>
<i>back to the wire room.</i>

30:04.538 --> 30:06.538
<i>Call Shane back, let him know</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

30:06.573 --> 30:09.343
Hey, Nour.
Just real quick, uh--

30:09.378 --> 30:14.117
Shane's rules, that one about
keeping the target alive?

30:14.152 --> 30:15.987
What's that about?
It's driving me crazy.

30:16.022 --> 30:18.286
<i>Remember that CI</i>
<i>I mentioned earlier?</i>

30:18.321 --> 30:21.927
<i>He told Shane that Eddie</i>
<i>has a list of dirty cops</i>
<i>who work for the cartel.</i>

30:21.962 --> 30:24.358
<i>They export loads,</i>
<i>run checks on databases,</i>
<i>stuff like that.</i>

30:24.393 --> 30:27.900
<i>Eddie keeps it</i>
<i>as his get out of jail free</i>
<i>card.</i>

30:27.935 --> 30:29.330
<i>And Shane hopes</i>
<i>if he can arrest him,</i>

30:29.365 --> 30:31.035
<i>he can be used</i>
<i>to go out on top.</i>

30:31.070 --> 30:33.598
<i>You know,</i>
<i>take down the shitbag</i>
<i>and the dirty cops.</i>

30:33.633 --> 30:36.370
<i>The problem is,</i>
<i>the list is in Eddie's head.</i>

30:36.405 --> 30:38.669
Okay, so Shane
needs him alive.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.572
<i>Exactly.</i>

30:40.607 --> 30:43.278
Well, how the hell do we
keep him alive from in here?

30:43.313 --> 30:45.610
<i>We can't. Call Shane.</i>

30:45.645 --> 30:48.481
Shit. All right.

30:53.994 --> 30:56.126
<i> It's Shane,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

30:56.161 --> 30:58.557
Hey, it's Justin.
I just wanted
to let you know

30:58.592 --> 31:01.593
that there is a group
of armed men at Eddie's house.

31:01.628 --> 31:04.596
I just spoke to Nour,
and she's on her way back in,

31:04.631 --> 31:08.006
and she thought you
might want to do the same.

31:08.041 --> 31:08.974
Uh...

31:10.472 --> 31:12.637
That's it. Okay. Bye.

31:47.344 --> 31:48.574
Fuck you!

31:49.577 --> 31:51.346
Tell your fucking friends.

32:05.626 --> 32:07.362
He just killed him.

32:31.619 --> 32:35.060
<i> Your call has been</i>
<i>forwarded to an automatic</i>
<i>voice message system.</i>

32:35.095 --> 32:41.726
<i>999-555-2183</i>
<i>is not available.</i>

32:41.761 --> 32:44.465
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>please record your message.</i>

32:44.500 --> 32:46.071
<i>When you're finished recordin,</i>

32:46.106 --> 32:48.700
<i>you may hang up or press one</i>
<i>for more options.</i>

32:50.003 --> 32:53.243
Goddamn it, Junior,
someone's come for me.
Where are you?

33:09.591 --> 33:12.823
Shit! It's my fucking men.

33:12.858 --> 33:14.594
It's my men coming after me.

33:15.696 --> 33:17.762
If I find out he sent them,

33:17.797 --> 33:20.402
I'll chop him up
into dog treats.

33:21.570 --> 33:23.834
Come on, Eddie. Come on.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.737
Turn around, you dumb fuck.

33:30.249 --> 33:31.281
Fuck...

33:33.648 --> 33:35.054
Fuck it.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.466
Answer it, goddamn it.
Answer it.

33:54.702 --> 33:56.768
About time you called back.

33:58.607 --> 33:59.773
Hello, you there?

33:59.808 --> 34:02.774
There's one
right outside your door.
He's coming your way.

34:05.218 --> 34:07.350
Quit playing,
I don't time for this.

34:07.385 --> 34:10.848
Hey, listen to me, asshole!
He's coming from your left!

34:10.883 --> 34:13.554
- There's no one there,
you lyin' piece--
- Your other left!

34:35.281 --> 34:38.348
Okay.
Let's talk.

34:39.681 --> 34:41.384
Who the fuck are you?

34:45.324 --> 34:46.521
<i>You still there?</i>

34:49.658 --> 34:51.493
Fuck.

34:54.861 --> 34:56.564
Oh, my God.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.896
Oh, my...

35:25.892 --> 35:28.464
<i>Sheriff's office.</i>
<i>Is this an emergency?</i>

35:28.499 --> 35:30.334
Yes, it is, uh--

35:30.369 --> 35:32.534
I need to speak
to the on-duty supervisor.

35:32.569 --> 35:33.865
<i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

35:33.900 --> 35:36.802
Special Agent Justin Rosa
of Homeland Security.

35:36.837 --> 35:38.639
<i>Hold, please.</i>

35:53.458 --> 35:54.589
This is Sergeant Roberts.

35:54.624 --> 35:55.656
Yes, look, uh...

35:56.857 --> 35:58.395
This is gonna sound
little strange,

35:58.430 --> 35:59.924
but we're on a T-3 right now,

35:59.959 --> 36:02.927
and the target
of our investigation
is under attack.

36:02.962 --> 36:04.500
<i>Under attack?</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>

36:04.535 --> 36:06.304
Well, some men
broke into his house,

36:06.339 --> 36:08.504
and it's-it's a complete
war zone out there.

36:08.539 --> 36:11.243
Okay, and what would you
like for me to do about that?

36:11.278 --> 36:13.245
- Well, if you could
send the cavalry.
<i>- Right.</i>

36:13.280 --> 36:16.974
And may I ask,
how come you guys
aren't doing that right now?

36:17.009 --> 36:21.385
Well, that's my next call,
but if you could please
just send a unit out there.

36:24.555 --> 36:27.424
- What's the address?
- It's, uh...

36:27.459 --> 36:29.657
903 Lake Point.

36:29.692 --> 36:32.396
That's L as in Lima,
A as in alpha--

36:32.431 --> 36:34.530
<i>Nine-0-3 Lake Point.</i>
<i>Got it.</i>

36:35.764 --> 36:37.797
All right,
I'll send some guys up.

36:37.832 --> 36:39.931
Thanks. Hey, um,

36:39.966 --> 36:41.834
any chance you can give me
a follow up call?

36:43.574 --> 36:45.376
<i>Well, if you're on a wire,</i>

36:45.411 --> 36:47.312
<i>- wouldn't you find that out?</i>
- Maybe, maybe.

36:47.347 --> 36:49.743
You're new, aren't you?

36:50.977 --> 36:53.318
- Yeah, is it that obvious?
<i>- Yes.</i>

36:53.353 --> 36:55.287
But I know a few
of the HSI guys

36:55.322 --> 36:57.421
and your name
didn't ring a bell, so...

36:57.456 --> 36:58.950
Yeah, it's my first day.

36:58.985 --> 37:01.920
<i>Wow. Wire room duty</i>
<i>on your first day?</i>

37:01.955 --> 37:04.593
- Lucky me.

37:04.628 --> 37:06.859
<i>Well, I look forward</i>
<i>to seeing you face-to-face</i>
<i>at some point.</i>

37:06.894 --> 37:08.894
Same here, Sergeant.
Thank you.

37:38.794 --> 37:39.892
Shit.

37:41.262 --> 37:45.832
<i>You've reached Homeland</i>
<i>Security Investigation</i>
<i>Special Agent Justin Rosa.</i>

37:45.867 --> 37:47.735
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

37:47.770 --> 37:49.440
Special Agent.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.739
<i>Aren't I lucky?</i>

37:51.774 --> 37:53.444
<i>Well, Mr. Rosa,</i>

37:53.479 --> 37:56.414
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why you called me,</i>

37:56.449 --> 37:59.648
but your number
is now in my cell.

37:59.683 --> 38:02.717
<i>And I can hide</i>
<i>from these goons easy.</i>

38:02.752 --> 38:07.084
<i>But if I die tonight,</i>
<i>someone is gonna wonder</i>

38:07.119 --> 38:11.924
<i>why a Special Agent</i>
<i>from Homeland Security</i>
<i>be callin' me.</i>

38:11.959 --> 38:15.059
<i>And that's not gonna</i>
<i>look good on your resume,</i>
<i>is it?</i>

38:15.094 --> 38:18.502
<i>So we need to chat,</i>
<i>sooner the better.</i>

38:18.537 --> 38:19.734
<i>Call me.</i>

38:28.712 --> 38:31.647
You are one annoying fuck,
you know that?

38:31.682 --> 38:33.143
I know. Uh, look,

38:33.178 --> 38:35.387
did you get my message
about the people at Eddie's?

38:35.422 --> 38:36.588
<i>People?</i>

38:36.623 --> 38:39.391
- What people?
-<i> I don't know</i>
<i>who they are, but, uh,</i>

38:39.426 --> 38:41.756
I-I called Nour,
and she's on her way back in.

38:41.791 --> 38:43.989
- She is?
-<i> Yeah. Uh, look...</i>

38:44.024 --> 38:48.026
Eddie got into a fight
with a guy and he killed him.

38:48.061 --> 38:49.830
- Eddie's dead?
<i>- No, no, Eddie--</i>

38:49.865 --> 38:52.767
Eddie killed the guy.
He blew his brains out.

38:52.802 --> 38:54.604
- What the fuck?
<i>- But don't worry.</i>

38:54.639 --> 38:57.068
- Don't worry.
I got it under control.
<i>- How?</i>

38:57.103 --> 38:59.675
- I talked to
the sheriff's department--
<i>- Why would you do that?</i>

38:59.710 --> 39:02.909
<i>Christ. Dirty cops</i>
<i>are everywhere.</i>

39:02.944 --> 39:04.944
Don't worry,
I talked to the supervisor

39:04.979 --> 39:08.178
<i>- and he sent</i>
<i>a unit out there.</i>
- Don't you call anyone else.

39:08.213 --> 39:11.588
<i>- You hear me? No one.</i>
- Yeah, um...

39:13.493 --> 39:14.492
<i>About that,</i>

39:14.528 --> 39:17.088
- I, uh--
-<i> You called him, didn't you?</i>

39:17.123 --> 39:19.959
- You called Eddie.
- Hey, your fucking rule

39:19.994 --> 39:22.665
said to keep him alive.
What was I supposed to do?

39:22.700 --> 39:24.865
<i>I was wrong.</i>
<i>You are an idiot.</i>

39:24.900 --> 39:26.669
A complete idiot.

39:26.704 --> 39:29.606
I did what I thought
was right for the case.

39:29.641 --> 39:32.642
- I couldn't just
let him die, right?
<i>- You listen to me.</i>

39:32.677 --> 39:34.776
You plant your ass
on the couch.

39:34.811 --> 39:36.206
Don't you dare move.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.747
<i>Not till I get there.</i>
<i>You got that?</i>

39:38.782 --> 39:40.815
- Yeah, yeah.
- <i> Oh, yeah.</i>

39:40.850 --> 39:44.588
<i>- This can't get any worse.</i>
- Uh...

39:44.623 --> 39:46.557
Jesus fucking Christ.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.856
<i>You're gonna tell me how,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

39:48.891 --> 39:51.529
Well, when I called Eddie,
I used my cell phone,

39:51.564 --> 39:55.962
so now he's got my number,
and he has since
called me back.

39:55.997 --> 39:57.700
Of course he has.

39:57.735 --> 39:59.999
<i>- Did you answer?</i>
- No, no, I didn't answer.

40:00.034 --> 40:01.770
<i>Call the sheriff's office.</i>

40:01.805 --> 40:03.101
You tell him you're wrong.

40:03.136 --> 40:05.642
- Okay.
-<i> Make something up.</i>

40:17.821 --> 40:20.921
Hey, Special Agent Rosa.
It's Mike.

40:20.956 --> 40:23.528
Oh, hey, Mike.

40:23.563 --> 40:26.190
- This fuckin'--
- Just checking in
on you, man.

40:26.225 --> 40:27.928
- Doin' okay up here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:27.963 --> 40:30.766
Just trying to keep
the place from burning down.
You know?

40:30.801 --> 40:33.901
- Not much else you can do
on wire room duty, huh?
- Yeah.

40:33.936 --> 40:37.872
Especially considering
you're not the, uh,
case agent.

40:37.907 --> 40:40.644
These guys, they get
pretty territorial
about that kind of--

40:40.679 --> 40:44.076
Mike, I hate to be rude,
but, uh, I got a really
important phone call--

40:44.111 --> 40:45.649
Yeah. No,
my-my apologies.

40:45.684 --> 40:47.178
I've been known
to drone on and on.

40:48.885 --> 40:51.149
Wife and kids always
get on me about it,
you know.

40:51.184 --> 40:53.184
Hey, look, maybe could
shoot the shit later, okay?

40:53.219 --> 40:55.890
- I gotta--
- Hey, deal.

40:55.925 --> 40:58.057
- All right, bye. All right.
- Listen, man,

40:58.092 --> 41:00.158
if you need any help
or anything like that,
I'm here.

41:00.193 --> 41:03.260
- I'm good. Thank you, Mike,
I appreciate it.
- Good? All right.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.097
- Sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:05.132 --> 41:06.538
- Yeah, good.

41:12.711 --> 41:15.173
- Hello?
- Special Agent Rosa.

41:15.208 --> 41:18.275
Yeah, hey, Sergeant Roberts,
I was just about to call you.

41:18.310 --> 41:21.080
Uh, apparently,
I made a mistake.

41:21.115 --> 41:23.049
There is no attack
on our target.

41:23.084 --> 41:25.953
Well, actually, that's why
I was giving you a call.

41:25.988 --> 41:29.627
Your target...
that's Eddie Flynn, right?

41:31.631 --> 41:33.026
Yeah. How'd you know that?

41:33.061 --> 41:34.764
Well, the address
seemed familiar.

41:34.799 --> 41:36.700
So we ran it
through our database here

41:36.735 --> 41:38.834
and come to find out
a few of our detectives

41:38.869 --> 41:40.264
are investigating him also.

41:40.299 --> 41:42.970
Well, if you could
have your men
stand down for now,

41:43.005 --> 41:44.840
I'd-I'd appreciate that.

41:44.875 --> 41:46.941
Well, knowing my guys,

41:46.976 --> 41:49.174
they'll probably do
a welfare check
regardless.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.822
<i>Actually, seems like</i>
<i>they're on the scene</i>
<i>right now.</i>

41:59.857 --> 42:01.890
<i>Hey, uh, hold on for a second.</i>
<i>Let me put you on hold.</i>

42:01.925 --> 42:03.661
Yeah, no problem.

42:16.401 --> 42:18.940
<i> We got this covered.</i>

42:18.975 --> 42:21.679
<i> Hey, it's good</i>
<i>to see you, man.</i>
<i>How you doing?</i>

42:24.750 --> 42:27.278
<i> Special Agent Rosa?</i>
<i>You there?</i>

42:27.313 --> 42:29.951
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.

42:29.986 --> 42:32.723
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>I'm glad my guys</i>
<i>cleared the scene.</i>

42:32.758 --> 42:34.252
<i>Everything's code fou.</i>

42:34.287 --> 42:37.090
<i>They did a standard</i>
<i>routine check around the house.</i>

42:37.125 --> 42:38.762
<i>No one's hom.</i>

42:38.797 --> 42:40.665
So, looks like
you were right.

42:40.700 --> 42:42.667
<i>Nothing's going on.</i>

42:45.738 --> 42:47.903
All right, well,
I appreciate it, Sergeant.

42:47.938 --> 42:49.300
Hey, anytime.

42:49.335 --> 42:51.907
And if you need anything else,
you just give me a call.

42:51.942 --> 42:52.974
Will do.

43:06.253 --> 43:10.860
<i>You've reached Homeland</i>
<i>Security Investigation</i>
<i>Special Agent Justin Rosa.</i>

43:10.895 --> 43:12.224
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

43:12.259 --> 43:14.963
- Special Agent Rosa?

43:16.166 --> 43:20.265
We both know these gobshites
aren't leaving 'til I'm dead.

43:20.300 --> 43:22.938
Which may not be
much longer.

43:22.973 --> 43:24.940
It's gonna be
very bad for you

43:24.975 --> 43:27.646
when someone finds
your number in my call log.

43:29.078 --> 43:31.210
Basically,
your career's fucked.

43:31.245 --> 43:32.651
<i>So pick up.</i>

43:41.486 --> 43:44.894
- How many of you fuckers
are cops?

43:50.429 --> 43:52.737
<i> Mr. Rosa.</i>

43:54.169 --> 43:55.773
You gotta stop calling me.

43:55.808 --> 43:57.742
Why would I do that?

43:57.777 --> 43:59.370
You saved my life.

43:59.405 --> 44:03.781
Plus, I really wanna know
why a Fed called to warn me.

44:03.816 --> 44:07.279
And more importantly,
how you knew.

44:09.888 --> 44:11.382
<i>Are you watching me?</i>

44:11.417 --> 44:14.022
Are you one of these gobshites
out here trying to kill me?

44:14.057 --> 44:17.454
- No. Those were sheriffs.
-<i> Sheriffs?</i>

44:17.489 --> 44:19.159
Was it Roberts?

44:22.032 --> 44:24.098
How the fuck
do you know Roberts?!

44:24.133 --> 44:27.464
I don't, I sent a unit out there
because I thought I saw--

44:27.499 --> 44:31.105
Saw? Are there
fuckin' cameras here?
Huh?

44:31.140 --> 44:35.076
<i>Have you got</i>
<i>a spy satellite</i>
<i>over my base?</i>

44:35.111 --> 44:36.781
<i>Can you see this, can ya?</i>

44:36.816 --> 44:40.444
<i>Huh?</i>
<i>Fuckin' have some!</i>

44:40.479 --> 44:42.754
<i>Or maybe you're watching me</i>
<i>through my phone.</i>

44:42.789 --> 44:45.383
<i>Is that it?</i>
<i>You listenin' to me?</i>

44:45.418 --> 44:48.925
<i>If you are, you're wasting</i>
<i>your fucking time.</i>

44:48.960 --> 44:51.862
<i>I don't use my phone</i>
<i>for anything business-related.</i>

44:53.426 --> 44:55.426
Nobody's listening to you.
Nobody's watching you.

44:55.461 --> 44:57.131
You're not
that fucking important.

44:57.166 --> 44:59.969
<i>Clearly I am.</i>

45:00.004 --> 45:01.839
<i>Otherwise, why'd you</i>
<i>call and warn me?</i>

45:01.874 --> 45:03.137
I told you,
it was a mistake.

45:03.172 --> 45:05.403
<i>Doesn't change the fact</i>
<i>that you did.</i>

45:05.438 --> 45:09.407
And I have no idea
how you knew,
but I will figure it out.

45:09.442 --> 45:11.046
You're fucking crazy.
You know that?

45:11.081 --> 45:14.852
Yeah? Let's see how
fuckin' crazy I really am!

45:23.324 --> 45:25.291
<i> Sheriff's office.</i>
<i>Is this an emergency?</i>

45:25.326 --> 45:26.457
Peter Roberts, please.

45:26.492 --> 45:28.195
<i>May I ask who's calling?</i>

45:28.230 --> 45:30.868
No.
<i>- Is this an emergency, sir?</i>

45:30.903 --> 45:34.036
It isn't yet, but the clock's
ticking, darling.

45:34.071 --> 45:36.907
- Put me through.
-<i> Hold, please.</i>

45:45.852 --> 45:48.248
- Roberts.
- You piece of shit.

45:48.283 --> 45:49.447
Eddie?

45:49.482 --> 45:51.449
Surprised I'm still
alive, are we?

45:51.484 --> 45:53.253
<i>What? No.</i>

45:55.290 --> 45:57.862
You're not calling me
from your cell, are you?

45:57.897 --> 46:00.997
- No.
-<i> Good. That's good.</i>

46:01.032 --> 46:02.328
<i>Okay, so why are you</i>
<i>calling me at work?</i>

46:02.363 --> 46:04.330
I've called you
around a dozen times
tonight,

46:04.365 --> 46:05.431
but you never answered.

46:05.466 --> 46:07.597
I don't answer
that cell at work.
You know that.

46:07.632 --> 46:11.304
No, you don't answer
when someone else calls,

46:11.339 --> 46:14.472
but if it's me,
you fucking answer.

46:16.014 --> 46:17.277
Look, I can't talk
right now, okay?

46:17.312 --> 46:18.542
I'm not alone.

46:19.578 --> 46:21.281
Funny, neither am I.

46:23.285 --> 46:25.824
Get alone. I'll wait.

46:34.230 --> 46:36.868
So, what's so urgent
that you couldn't wait

46:36.903 --> 46:38.069
until after I got off work?

46:38.104 --> 46:41.301
Let's start
with the army of men
you sent to kill me.

46:41.336 --> 46:44.370
Army of men? I have no idea
what you're talking about, man.

46:44.405 --> 46:45.910
Don't, Junior.

46:47.606 --> 46:48.672
Junior.

46:48.707 --> 46:53.247
I know it was you
who orchestrated
all of this.

46:53.282 --> 46:55.282
What I want to know
is why.

46:57.957 --> 46:59.253
Why?

47:00.993 --> 47:03.455
<i>Why, why, why?</i>

47:06.933 --> 47:10.066
Because you put
our organization at risk.

47:10.101 --> 47:12.035
<i>That's why.</i>

47:12.070 --> 47:15.940
<i>Allowed a snitch</i>
<i>to infiltrate</i>
<i>your little enclave.</i>

47:15.975 --> 47:19.042
Do you know how much intel
he probably got?

47:19.077 --> 47:20.373
None of it important.

47:20.408 --> 47:22.111
You don't know that.

47:22.146 --> 47:23.607
I had to deal
with it, not you.

47:25.314 --> 47:28.315
<i>Now I have to clean up</i>
<i>the other messes.</i>

47:28.350 --> 47:29.415
One of which is you.

47:29.450 --> 47:33.188
<i>And you'll be dead</i>
<i>by morning.</i>

47:33.223 --> 47:35.960
Is this little plan of yours
approved down south?

47:40.461 --> 47:42.197
Didn't think so.

47:44.102 --> 47:48.467
And if you think
I'm a problem...
just wait.

47:51.274 --> 47:53.208
You're out of your league.

47:53.243 --> 47:55.408
<i>Or do I have to remind you</i>

47:55.443 --> 48:00.149
<i>the last time you</i>
<i>got kicked out of town,</i>
<i>like a little rat?</i>

48:00.184 --> 48:03.152
<i>You lost your empire,</i>
<i>tucked tail</i>

48:03.187 --> 48:05.550
and ran
like a little bitch.

48:07.092 --> 48:09.422
Now you're just
a paranoid lackey.

48:09.457 --> 48:12.392
A middleman.
A reject.

48:12.427 --> 48:16.099
I'm the king.

48:16.134 --> 48:18.233
I'll own this town.

48:18.268 --> 48:20.499
You don't got shit on me.

48:20.534 --> 48:26.043
Without me, this entire ship
goes down like the<i> Titanic.</i>

48:26.078 --> 48:27.979
You hear me?

48:28.014 --> 48:30.476
I'll cook you
like the chickenshit you are,

48:30.511 --> 48:32.709
you fuckin' weasel!

48:32.744 --> 48:36.317
<i>I could see it</i>
<i>in your eyes all along</i>
<i>you were gonna fuck me!</i>

48:36.352 --> 48:39.650
You think your bitch boys
can succeed in their mission?

48:39.685 --> 48:42.323
- Huh?
- Oh, absolutely.
Without a doubt.

48:42.358 --> 48:44.259
<i>Is that a promise,</i>
<i>sweetheart?</i>

48:44.294 --> 48:47.625
Then please tell me
why two of them are dead,

48:47.660 --> 48:49.693
and I'm still breathing!

48:49.728 --> 48:53.103
Oh, and Sergeant Roberts...

48:53.905 --> 48:58.174
I am using my cell,
which is being monitored
by the Feds!

48:59.771 --> 49:02.409
But I think you
already knew that,
didn't you?

49:08.516 --> 49:11.649
Shit. Peggy!

49:11.684 --> 49:13.684
Let's fucking go.

49:25.533 --> 49:29.238
How's that for crazy,
Special Agent Rosa?

49:29.273 --> 49:32.736
You have my number.
We have a lot to discuss.

49:51.460 --> 49:53.625
Thanks for confirming
you're listening to my calls.

49:55.431 --> 49:59.103
And that probably means
there are cameras in here.

49:59.138 --> 50:02.766
Which would explain
how you saw something.

50:10.875 --> 50:13.612
There's nothing there.
You're just being paranoid.

50:13.647 --> 50:14.679
Is that right?

50:15.481 --> 50:17.484
We'll see about that,
won't we?

50:19.257 --> 50:20.553
<i>Come on.</i>

50:20.588 --> 50:23.457
Come to Eddie. Yeah.

50:27.628 --> 50:31.333
<i>You crafty little bastard.</i>

50:31.368 --> 50:32.565
Fuckin'...

50:33.401 --> 50:36.107
<i>How many more</i>
<i>of these are there? Eh?</i>

50:38.507 --> 50:40.276
You really want to know?

50:47.285 --> 50:49.582
I hope you've enjoyed
everything you've seen so far,

50:49.617 --> 50:51.683
because mostly like
your wire room,

50:51.718 --> 50:54.620
these are nothing
but a waste of your time.

50:54.655 --> 50:57.722
I'm hanging up.
Erase my number,
forget we ever spoke.

50:57.757 --> 50:59.592
<i>And what's that gonna fix?</i>

50:59.627 --> 51:01.858
If it's your job
you're worried about,
don't.

51:01.893 --> 51:03.266
I gave you Junior.

51:04.135 --> 51:08.733
He's a high-ranking,
well-respected member
of law enforcement.

51:08.768 --> 51:11.736
Probably be awarded
some sort of medal.

51:12.672 --> 51:16.609
But we'll have to survive
the night first.

51:16.644 --> 51:19.909
<i>So, are you ready</i>
<i>to go to war, Mr. Rosa?</i>

51:19.944 --> 51:20.676
What does that mean?

51:20.712 --> 51:24.485
If I know Junior,
which I do,

51:24.520 --> 51:28.291
he'll be coming after you
and your evidence.

51:28.326 --> 51:31.624
Yeah, he's really
gonna attack
a federal building?

51:31.659 --> 51:34.792
It's too risky,
and for all he knows,
we have nothing on him.

51:34.827 --> 51:38.862
No, for all he knows,
you have everything.

51:38.897 --> 51:43.207
Which threatens that perfect
little life of his.

51:43.242 --> 51:46.243
<i>So he'll be coming</i>
<i>after you.</i>

51:47.543 --> 51:49.543
<i>He'll be coming fuckin' hard.</i>

51:54.913 --> 51:56.484
Yeah, well,
he can't get up here.

51:56.519 --> 51:57.815
<i>Too well protected.</i>

51:57.850 --> 52:00.356
Who're you
trying to convince?

52:36.460 --> 52:38.757
We got guards here,
armed guards.

52:38.792 --> 52:40.363
Six, right?

52:42.301 --> 52:43.828
They're Junior's guys.

52:43.863 --> 52:46.963
<i>The only difference</i>
<i>between you and me,</i>

52:46.998 --> 52:49.273
<i>is they don't know where I am.</i>

52:50.573 --> 52:51.671
No.

52:56.447 --> 52:57.941
These are our guys.

52:57.976 --> 53:00.614
<i>After everything today,</i>
<i>are you still that naive?</i>

53:06.886 --> 53:07.951
What the fu--

53:09.559 --> 53:11.295
Mikey, what the hell?

53:11.330 --> 53:13.330
Fuck, man, I told you
to get out of here.

53:15.301 --> 53:16.564
What's going on?

53:18.601 --> 53:19.732
Well...

53:21.406 --> 53:23.736
looks like there's been
a, uh, small...

53:23.771 --> 53:25.243
<i>change in plans.</i>

53:26.741 --> 53:28.279
What the fuck?!

53:54.505 --> 53:56.637
<i>Hey, whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

53:56.672 --> 53:58.342
<i>Easy, guys, easy.</i>

53:58.377 --> 53:59.937
<i>Weapon discharged,</i>
<i>it's okay.</i>

53:59.972 --> 54:02.445
<i>It's okay,</i>
<i>it's all under control.</i>

54:02.480 --> 54:04.711
<i>Relax. Relax, relax, guys.</i>

54:04.746 --> 54:06.012
<i>Got it all under control.</i>

54:06.048 --> 54:08.352
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>if I hear anything else.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

54:10.488 --> 54:12.488
<i>You guys have a good night.</i>
<i>I'll see you in a little bit.</i>

54:25.302 --> 54:27.635
<i> It's Shane.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

54:27.670 --> 54:28.867
- Shit.

54:34.974 --> 54:37.645
- Yeah?
- One of the SUVs just left.

54:44.951 --> 54:46.555
Guessing they're coming
for you.

54:46.590 --> 54:49.459
Looks like
we're both up shit's creek.

54:49.494 --> 54:51.054
Yeah, that's
really helpful. Thanks.

54:52.662 --> 54:54.629
Now don't lose hope,
Agent Rosa.

54:54.664 --> 54:56.730
You know the playbook.

54:56.765 --> 55:01.031
Right now they're gonna try
and use my girl as insurance.

55:01.066 --> 55:04.100
Let's see how far they get.

55:04.135 --> 55:07.444
It's time for me
to bring out
my fucking toys.

55:08.975 --> 55:11.514
Aye. We're gonna
have some fun.

55:12.847 --> 55:14.748
<i>I like playing.</i>
<i>Do you?</i>

55:15.817 --> 55:17.047
Are you ready?

55:19.524 --> 55:20.919
It's fucking time.

55:20.954 --> 55:23.119
Focus on what's coming
your way.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.396
I can handle
the rest of them here.

55:25.431 --> 55:27.156
Oh, yeah?

55:27.191 --> 55:29.862
Like you handled that guy
that snuck up on you earlier?

55:31.668 --> 55:33.668
Why do you care
if I live or die?

55:38.004 --> 55:42.006
I took an oath
to protect and serve.

55:43.911 --> 55:46.747
I know that might sound
corny to you.

55:46.782 --> 55:48.782
But that's something
I believe in.

55:51.523 --> 55:53.853
Touching. Truly.

55:55.758 --> 55:58.022
All right, we're gonna
focus on you first.

55:58.057 --> 56:01.091
I'll deal with my shit
as it comes.

56:01.126 --> 56:04.160
And just how do you
plan on keeping me alive
from wherever you are?

56:06.065 --> 56:08.472
All right,
I'm gonna be your eyes.

56:08.507 --> 56:11.706
You just need to trust me
and listen to me.

56:11.741 --> 56:15.072
You think you could do that?
You're not a good listener.

56:15.107 --> 56:16.744
Any other option?

56:16.779 --> 56:19.142
Not if you want to get out
of here in one piece.

56:19.177 --> 56:22.178
Such a fuckin' cliché fact,
you know that?

56:25.788 --> 56:27.920
Okay, let's begin.

56:32.663 --> 56:35.862
All right.
What have we here?

56:43.267 --> 56:44.541
Okay.

56:46.237 --> 56:49.205
You got three of them
by the garage.

56:49.240 --> 56:50.943
But you can't just go
in there with your AK,

56:50.978 --> 56:52.043
it's too loud.

56:53.178 --> 56:55.453
I think I got
something for that.

56:59.283 --> 57:01.217
Wow, Eddie!

57:01.252 --> 57:03.758
You do know that's
an illegal firearm,
don't you?

57:03.793 --> 57:05.793
Well, I don't always
play by the rules.

57:08.996 --> 57:10.501
I'm ready.

57:39.895 --> 57:41.565
Okay, he's heading your way.

57:41.600 --> 57:43.666
Hide, hide, get down, go!

57:51.874 --> 57:53.269
All right, just stay there.

58:03.622 --> 58:05.149
He's coming around.

58:05.184 --> 58:06.050
<i>Just stay there.</i>

58:06.085 --> 58:07.789
He's coming around
the front of the truck.

58:09.122 --> 58:11.089
On my mark... Now.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.533
What was that?

58:17.295 --> 58:18.701
That's one down.

58:20.331 --> 58:22.199
Nice shot, Eddie.

58:22.234 --> 58:24.201
Okay, you got a couple
headed your way.

58:36.182 --> 58:37.247
Okay.

58:41.022 --> 58:43.660
All right, all right.
Stay there. Stay right there.

58:53.067 --> 58:54.803
Okay.

58:54.838 --> 58:56.233
Wait, wait, wait.
Stay there.

59:01.680 --> 59:04.043
Good, they're moving around
the front of the truck.

59:05.882 --> 59:07.013
All right, on my mark.

59:08.016 --> 59:08.949
Now.

59:13.252 --> 59:14.658
<i>Very nice.</i>

59:14.693 --> 59:16.220
Very nice, Eddie.

59:16.255 --> 59:17.353
That makes three.

59:19.324 --> 59:20.994
All clear.

59:41.687 --> 59:44.985
Hello... Junior.

59:46.417 --> 59:48.923
How about we handle this
diplomatically?

59:48.958 --> 59:50.023
<i>Shall we?</i>

59:51.290 --> 59:53.796
And how do you
propose we do this?

59:53.831 --> 59:56.260
You simply delete
any evidence you have on me.

59:56.295 --> 1:00:00.330
- Mm. And what's in it for me?
- I'll let you live.

1:00:02.004 --> 1:00:04.136
Well, that's very nice
of you, Junior.

1:00:04.171 --> 1:00:05.874
What more could you want?

1:00:05.909 --> 1:00:07.678
Nothing...

1:00:07.713 --> 1:00:10.175
from a piece of shit,
dirty cop like you.

1:00:10.210 --> 1:00:14.212
You know,
you're very brave
for a man who's all alone.

1:00:14.247 --> 1:00:16.445
Oh, I'm not alone.

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:19.921
- There are other agents
in here.
<i>- Ah, come on.</i>

1:00:19.956 --> 1:00:22.792
Now, you and I both know
that's not true.

1:00:22.827 --> 1:00:25.861
- Yeah.
-<i> But my guys are.</i>

1:00:25.896 --> 1:00:29.194
So what, are you gonna send
your rent-a-cops in here

1:00:29.229 --> 1:00:31.163
to attack a secure wire room?

1:00:32.397 --> 1:00:34.298
You mean a wire room

1:00:34.333 --> 1:00:36.971
that my rent-a-cops
have the keys to?

1:00:51.119 --> 1:00:52.756
No, no, no.

1:01:00.896 --> 1:01:03.294
- <i> Cindy, is that you?</i>

1:01:06.497 --> 1:01:08.937
She can't come to
the phone right now.

1:01:11.810 --> 1:01:13.337
<i>Fuck you, cunt.</i>

1:01:13.372 --> 1:01:15.438
Let her go.
You're here for me.

1:01:15.473 --> 1:01:17.011
<i> Please, help me!</i>

1:01:19.444 --> 1:01:21.048
Baby, baby...

1:01:21.083 --> 1:01:24.249
<i> This is taking</i>
<i>too much time as it is.</i>

1:01:24.284 --> 1:01:25.349
So you know how this goes.

1:01:27.826 --> 1:01:30.123
<i>Come out, she live.</i>

1:01:31.126 --> 1:01:34.325
You don't, she dies.

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:35.898
You won't do nothing.

1:01:36.901 --> 1:01:38.230
You have five seconds.

1:01:42.874 --> 1:01:45.435
I've taken proper shits
that bother me more than you.

1:01:45.470 --> 1:01:47.371
- Five...

1:01:47.406 --> 1:01:48.779
Four...

1:01:50.376 --> 1:01:52.541
-<i> Three...</i>
- Okay, fuck!

1:01:52.576 --> 1:01:54.246
I'm in the garage.

1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:57.447
Eddie, I'm sorry
for earlier.

1:01:57.482 --> 1:02:00.153
It's okay. I'm gonna
come find you. Okay?

1:02:00.188 --> 1:02:02.551
I'm gonna come
fuckin' find you.
I've got ya.

1:02:02.586 --> 1:02:04.927
<i>- Don't you worry.</i>
No, no, no...

1:02:06.425 --> 1:02:07.490
Holy fuck.

1:02:09.032 --> 1:02:10.229
<i>Cindy!</i>

1:02:11.496 --> 1:02:13.001
<i>Cindy!</i>

1:02:13.036 --> 1:02:14.068
Cindy!

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:16.807
Fuck it!

1:02:16.842 --> 1:02:19.975
You motherfucking
fucking cunt!

1:02:20.010 --> 1:02:22.912
<i>You're fucking dead when I get</i>
<i>my hands on you, you hear me?</i>

1:02:22.947 --> 1:02:24.980
<i>You're fucking dead!</i>

1:02:25.015 --> 1:02:27.312
You fucking hear me?!
Fucking dead!

1:02:27.347 --> 1:02:29.347
I'll fuckin' get ya!

1:02:47.873 --> 1:02:50.401
They killed her!
They fucking killed her!

1:02:50.436 --> 1:02:52.403
Yeah, I know. I know, Eddie.

1:02:52.438 --> 1:02:54.845
You gotta stay focused,
all right?

1:02:54.880 --> 1:02:57.210
- There's some guys come--

1:03:03.955 --> 1:03:05.317
Oh, shit.

1:03:05.352 --> 1:03:07.550
All right, all right,
change of plans.

1:03:07.585 --> 1:03:09.156
I need you to hide,
All right?

1:03:09.191 --> 1:03:10.322
<i>Can you do that?</i>

1:03:10.357 --> 1:03:13.061
I'm gonna gut
these fuckers like fish.

1:03:16.132 --> 1:03:18.231
Hey, the pool house.
There's a basement.

1:03:18.266 --> 1:03:21.003
- Get to the pool house
basement.
- That's your plan?

1:03:21.038 --> 1:03:23.401
Hide in a fucking basement,
like a rat?

1:03:23.436 --> 1:03:26.239
For now. Go! Go!

1:03:30.575 --> 1:03:32.542
Justin, there's been
a breach.

1:03:32.577 --> 1:03:35.083
I gotta get you
to a safe location now.
Let's go.

1:03:35.118 --> 1:03:36.920
Yeah, I can't do
that, Mike.

1:03:38.352 --> 1:03:40.418
I saw what you did
downstairs.

1:03:44.556 --> 1:03:47.128
Ah, Justin,
goddamn it.

1:03:47.163 --> 1:03:50.659
See, now that's...
that's really unfortunate,

1:03:50.694 --> 1:03:53.299
because, you know,
I wasn't gonna kill you.

1:03:53.334 --> 1:03:56.005
I really liked you, man.

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:57.105
But now?

1:04:15.994 --> 1:04:19.193
Come on, Justin,
put the gun down.

1:04:19.228 --> 1:04:22.130
I promise to make it quick
and painless.

1:04:23.463 --> 1:04:24.462
Scout's honor.

1:04:50.292 --> 1:04:51.324
Hey, Boy Scout.

1:05:07.474 --> 1:05:11.311
Goddamn it, Mike!
Why'd you make me do that?

1:05:12.578 --> 1:05:15.018
You have no idea
what's coming.

1:05:16.648 --> 1:05:18.252
Junior...

1:05:18.287 --> 1:05:20.221
he ain't gonna stop
until you're dead.

1:05:23.358 --> 1:05:26.194
Burn the whole world down
to get what you got in here.

1:05:27.626 --> 1:05:29.428
Where are the others?

1:05:29.463 --> 1:05:31.969
You know the answer
to that.

1:05:34.567 --> 1:05:36.699
And that...

1:05:36.734 --> 1:05:38.503
That ain't gonna
hold 'em off.

1:05:39.737 --> 1:05:41.440
It held you off.

1:05:42.476 --> 1:05:44.014
You got lucky.

1:05:45.017 --> 1:05:47.545
But you ain't gonna
get lucky four more times.

1:05:49.351 --> 1:05:51.615
Yeah, maybe not.

1:05:51.650 --> 1:05:53.353
But help is coming.

1:05:56.424 --> 1:05:58.424
Sorry I won't be around...

1:05:59.326 --> 1:06:02.065
to see who gets here first.

1:06:41.304 --> 1:06:42.699
<i>- Fuck!</i>
Where are you?

1:06:58.816 --> 1:07:01.223
<i>We got him.</i>
<i>Man down.</i>

1:07:01.258 --> 1:07:03.192
<i>I repeat, man dow.</i>

1:07:03.227 --> 1:07:05.788
<i>- Do not fire.</i>
No!

1:07:05.823 --> 1:07:06.822
No.

1:07:08.166 --> 1:07:09.396
Fuck!

1:07:17.142 --> 1:07:18.471
Okay.

1:07:30.848 --> 1:07:32.188
What the...?

1:07:47.700 --> 1:07:50.239
- <i> Hey.</i>
- You still there, Fed?

1:07:53.805 --> 1:07:55.673
Yeah, I'm still here.

1:07:56.841 --> 1:07:58.445
I thought you were dead.

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:00.348
Ah, you care about me, do ya?

1:08:01.450 --> 1:08:03.351
Let's not get crazy.

1:08:04.618 --> 1:08:06.354
How are things your end?

1:08:06.389 --> 1:08:09.885
I'm good... for now.

1:08:11.196 --> 1:08:13.361
Good. We're making progress.

1:08:13.396 --> 1:08:15.396
We're a team.
Look at that.

1:08:25.573 --> 1:08:27.177
Hold on.

1:08:46.495 --> 1:08:48.231
What's the status?

1:08:49.960 --> 1:08:52.268
<i>Well, his status</i>
<i>ain't so good.</i>

1:08:53.634 --> 1:08:56.635
Ah, Special Agent Rosa.

1:08:56.670 --> 1:08:57.834
<i>Impressiv.</i>

1:08:58.837 --> 1:09:00.573
Yeah, just a little warm up

1:09:00.608 --> 1:09:02.212
<i>while I wait for yo.</i>

1:09:03.611 --> 1:09:04.676
I looked you up, Agent.

1:09:06.350 --> 1:09:07.679
<i>From Secret Service duy</i>

1:09:07.714 --> 1:09:11.287
<i>to just a lower</i>
<i>wire room grunt.</i>

1:09:11.322 --> 1:09:13.751
Ironic, going
from protecting senators

1:09:13.786 --> 1:09:16.193
to trying to keep
that scum Eddie alive.

1:09:17.559 --> 1:09:20.263
Yeah, well,
a job's a job.

1:09:20.298 --> 1:09:25.862
Well, Agent, looks like
you failed at your duties again.

1:09:25.897 --> 1:09:28.502
You know, it seems to be
a pattern for you.

1:09:28.537 --> 1:09:31.406
<i>Disappointment</i>
<i>follows you around.</i>

1:09:31.441 --> 1:09:33.276
<i>Oh...</i>

1:09:33.311 --> 1:09:34.310
My apologies.

1:09:34.345 --> 1:09:36.279
I hate to be
the bearer of bad news.

1:09:36.314 --> 1:09:37.808
<i>Your target's dead.</i>

1:09:37.843 --> 1:09:41.284
<i>Seems like the coward</i>
<i>was hiding in the basement.</i>

1:09:41.319 --> 1:09:44.221
<i>Why do they always</i>
<i>hide in the basement?</i>

1:09:45.884 --> 1:09:47.785
Seems like your case
is closed.

1:09:48.953 --> 1:09:52.020
Oh, no, our case
is just ramping up.

1:09:52.055 --> 1:09:54.022
<i>We got a new target.</i>

1:09:54.057 --> 1:09:55.991
You.

1:09:56.026 --> 1:09:58.301
I'm not too concerned.

1:09:59.535 --> 1:10:00.864
You should be.

1:10:16.981 --> 1:10:19.685
- Okay. You there?

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:21.456
You at the house yet?

1:10:21.491 --> 1:10:23.953
<i> You're one ballsy</i>
<i>son of a bitch,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

1:10:23.988 --> 1:10:25.691
Yeah, I know,
I've been told.

1:10:25.726 --> 1:10:27.561
He's gonna destroy you.

1:10:27.596 --> 1:10:29.860
Yeah, he's definitely
gonna try.

1:10:29.895 --> 1:10:32.896
You need to know
when to stop,
when to give up.

1:10:32.931 --> 1:10:34.832
<i>Now is that time.</i>

1:10:34.867 --> 1:10:38.374
Your sacrificing your job
and your life.
For what?

1:10:38.409 --> 1:10:40.409
<i>A worthless investigatio?</i>

1:10:42.512 --> 1:10:44.281
You don't know what we have.

1:10:45.317 --> 1:10:49.550
I know that if you
had something, I'd be
in cuffs by now.

1:10:49.585 --> 1:10:50.881
There's more to it.

1:10:50.916 --> 1:10:53.389
<i>Like you're trying</i>
<i>to be a hero,</i>

1:10:53.424 --> 1:10:54.753
<i>trying to prove somethin.</i>

1:10:55.789 --> 1:10:58.086
Was Daddy a cop?

1:10:58.121 --> 1:10:59.593
Was that it?

1:10:59.628 --> 1:11:01.463
<i>Are you trying</i>
<i>to make him proud?</i>

1:11:02.796 --> 1:11:03.993
Oh, fuck off.

1:11:04.895 --> 1:11:07.469
Or maybe you're just
trying to right a wrong,

1:11:07.504 --> 1:11:08.734
seeking a little redemption.

1:11:08.769 --> 1:11:10.505
<i>We've all been ther.</i>

1:11:10.540 --> 1:11:12.375
You don't know me, asshole.

1:11:12.410 --> 1:11:15.708
Oh, but I think I do,
Special Agent Rosa.

1:11:15.743 --> 1:11:18.414
<i>How is it</i>
<i>a smart guy like you</i>

1:11:18.449 --> 1:11:20.812
ends up in a shitty wire room?

1:11:20.847 --> 1:11:23.980
<i>What did you fuck up</i>
<i>so badly</i>

1:11:24.015 --> 1:11:26.950
<i>that you'd need to fix</i>
<i>by rescuing me?</i>

1:11:26.985 --> 1:11:29.821
Hey, you'd be dead
if it wasn't for me.

1:11:29.856 --> 1:11:32.890
Don't try and get in my head.
There's no room
for you in here.

1:11:32.925 --> 1:11:34.826
Apologies.

1:11:34.861 --> 1:11:39.061
But there must be some reason
why you risked everything.

1:11:39.096 --> 1:11:41.503
<i>What is it the Feds</i>
<i>want so badly,</i>

1:11:41.538 --> 1:11:45.507
they're willing to risk
an entire investigation
to get it, huh?

1:11:45.542 --> 1:11:48.609
What is it that I have
that everyone is--

1:11:51.812 --> 1:11:52.877
The list!

1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:56.078
The fucking list.

1:11:56.113 --> 1:11:59.884
It doesn't exist.
Sorry.

1:11:59.919 --> 1:12:02.656
<i>You risked everything</i>
<i>for a rumor.</i>

1:12:02.691 --> 1:12:05.824
Oh, no, it's much bigger
than that now.

1:12:07.091 --> 1:12:08.860
List or no list...

1:12:09.729 --> 1:12:12.094
I'm gonna see this thing
through to the end.

1:12:13.867 --> 1:12:17.770
And how does this end,
Special Agent Rosa?

1:12:21.875 --> 1:12:24.909
- I haven't thought it
through yet.
<i>- But I have.</i>

1:12:26.946 --> 1:12:30.145
You're gonna help me
get out of here alive.

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:33.489
And then I'm gonna pull
a Keyser Soze,

1:12:33.524 --> 1:12:35.986
ride into the sunset.

1:12:36.021 --> 1:12:38.923
Poof! I'm fucking gone.

1:12:40.531 --> 1:12:44.192
If you do,
I'll be coming for you.

1:12:44.227 --> 1:12:47.767
Yeah? Will ya?
You promise?

1:12:49.507 --> 1:12:52.002
Oh, yeah. I promise.

1:12:54.039 --> 1:12:55.841
Goddamn it.

1:12:55.876 --> 1:12:58.580
I'm beginning to love
that hoo-rah attitude.

1:12:58.615 --> 1:13:01.814
<i>Right, let's get</i>
<i>our fucking skates on.</i>

1:13:01.849 --> 1:13:03.013
All right, let's do it.

1:13:04.181 --> 1:13:05.785
All right.

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:08.755
There are three downstairs
in the main structure.

1:13:08.790 --> 1:13:11.692
One heading to the basement now.
Get out of sight.

1:13:19.570 --> 1:13:21.229
Okay, hold right there.

1:13:21.264 --> 1:13:24.100
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>
<i>Okay, now.</i>

1:13:27.842 --> 1:13:29.138
Fuck you.

1:13:33.848 --> 1:13:35.947
<i>There's another one</i>
<i>coming. Move.</i>

1:13:37.819 --> 1:13:38.884
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

1:13:38.919 --> 1:13:40.985
Steady. Don't move.

1:13:42.054 --> 1:13:43.856
Don't fucking move.

1:13:46.729 --> 1:13:48.058
Now. Go.

1:13:51.866 --> 1:13:56.000
All right, Eddie.
Nice. Very nice.

1:13:56.035 --> 1:13:57.804
You got some skills.

1:14:00.303 --> 1:14:02.941
The rest are all upstairs.

1:14:07.585 --> 1:14:09.849
At the top of the stairs
go left,

1:14:09.884 --> 1:14:11.587
get the one in the bathroom.

1:14:14.185 --> 1:14:15.250
Be quiet, right there.

1:14:24.063 --> 1:14:25.766
All right, all right.

1:14:31.268 --> 1:14:34.038
All right, there's two more
in the front entrance.

1:14:34.073 --> 1:14:37.679
It's, uh...
it's also where
they killed Cindy.

1:14:37.714 --> 1:14:39.879
So prepare yourself.

1:14:45.953 --> 1:14:47.755
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1:14:47.790 --> 1:14:49.218
You fuckin' stay
right there.

1:14:49.253 --> 1:14:51.792
Keep your fuckin' hands
down, missy.

1:14:57.294 --> 1:15:00.064
Did you really think
I was gonna let her live?

1:15:02.134 --> 1:15:04.574
Do you really think
I'm gonna let you?

1:15:15.686 --> 1:15:17.213
Fuck.

1:15:20.625 --> 1:15:23.824
I'm fuckin' sorry, baby.
I'm fuckin' sorry.

1:15:34.837 --> 1:15:36.870
Feel better?

1:15:36.905 --> 1:15:39.202
Spiritually
fuckin' enlightened, yeah.

1:15:40.810 --> 1:15:42.304
That's it
for downstairs, right?

1:15:43.780 --> 1:15:45.615
All right,
the rest are upstairs.

1:15:47.245 --> 1:15:48.618
<i>Okay.</i>

1:15:57.662 --> 1:15:59.695
Why're you stopping?
What are you waiting for?

1:15:59.730 --> 1:16:01.224
How many, and where?

1:16:01.259 --> 1:16:03.963
<i>Two in the hallway,</i>
<i>one in the master bedroom.</i>

1:16:03.998 --> 1:16:05.932
I truly appreciate
your help, Fed.

1:16:05.967 --> 1:16:07.703
<i>This is where</i>
<i>I bid you farewell.</i>

1:16:07.738 --> 1:16:08.737
No, you mother...

1:16:14.976 --> 1:16:18.010
fucker... What the fuck?

1:16:18.045 --> 1:16:20.012
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:16:20.047 --> 1:16:21.145
<i>Listen to me.</i>

1:16:22.445 --> 1:16:24.181
<i>What the hell?</i>

1:16:24.216 --> 1:16:26.150
<i>It's time for me</i>
<i>to saddle up my horse.</i>

1:16:27.758 --> 1:16:30.022
See you
on the other side, Rosa.

1:16:44.302 --> 1:16:46.137
- God--

1:16:58.151 --> 1:17:00.789
<i> Do not engage.</i>
<i>Hold in the stairwell.</i>

1:17:00.824 --> 1:17:02.285
<i>Reinforcements en route.</i>

1:17:25.409 --> 1:17:27.310
<i> Hold on.</i>
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

1:17:27.345 --> 1:17:29.213
Hey, hey,
you got any guns here?

1:17:29.248 --> 1:17:31.050
Why the fuck
do you need guns?

1:17:31.085 --> 1:17:33.118
Do you have any guns?
Yes or no?

1:17:33.153 --> 1:17:35.087
There's a safe in the office.

1:17:48.773 --> 1:17:49.871
Fuck.

1:17:55.439 --> 1:17:57.340
What the hell
have you done?

1:17:59.245 --> 1:18:01.443
Don't point that at me.

1:18:01.478 --> 1:18:03.016
Open the safe.

1:18:04.019 --> 1:18:05.887
Jesus Christ.

1:18:05.922 --> 1:18:08.989
Come on. I'm not
playing games.

1:18:09.024 --> 1:18:12.025
- Open it.
- I'm not playing either.

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:13.389
- Come on.
- All right.

1:18:14.997 --> 1:18:16.260
Just calm down,
all right?

1:18:16.295 --> 1:18:18.097
I am calm, open it.

1:18:23.104 --> 1:18:26.270
Mm-hmm... 72...

1:18:26.305 --> 1:18:27.975
Jesus Christ.

1:18:33.048 --> 1:18:35.785
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you fuckin'
with me, Shane?

1:18:35.820 --> 1:18:36.786
Open it!

1:18:43.894 --> 1:18:45.025
Back up.

1:18:46.028 --> 1:18:47.093
Bingo.

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:52.329
You wanna tell me
what's going on?

1:18:52.364 --> 1:18:55.937
Fuck if I know.
You called me.

1:18:56.806 --> 1:18:59.336
- Are you one of them?
- Why do you think that?

1:18:59.371 --> 1:19:02.878
Well, after you
ran out of here earlier,

1:19:02.913 --> 1:19:04.880
then I see you down there
having a smoke with Mike,

1:19:04.915 --> 1:19:07.179
the security guard who tried to
fucking kill me.

1:19:07.214 --> 1:19:09.280
You think I'm corrupt?

1:19:10.283 --> 1:19:11.986
After the day I had today.

1:19:12.021 --> 1:19:13.988
The day that you
brought on yourself.

1:19:14.023 --> 1:19:17.123
- I oughta...
- I'm not with him.

1:19:17.158 --> 1:19:19.191
I was meeting my buddy.

1:19:19.226 --> 1:19:21.094
Yet you decided to go
have a smoke. Huh?

1:19:21.129 --> 1:19:22.128
Waiting for a cab.

1:19:23.030 --> 1:19:26.836
- You didn't drive
your car to work?
- I was going drinking.

1:19:30.072 --> 1:19:31.434
Okay. Okay.

1:19:33.438 --> 1:19:35.174
You're still dumb
as a rock.

1:19:35.209 --> 1:19:37.979
All right, I'm sorry, all right?
I fucked up, all right?

1:19:38.014 --> 1:19:40.047
It's been a little crazy
around here.

1:19:40.082 --> 1:19:42.247
If you're done,
explain this.

1:19:42.282 --> 1:19:44.612
Why are the guards
trying to kill you?

1:19:44.647 --> 1:19:48.022
- They're with Junior.
- Junior?

1:19:48.057 --> 1:19:49.221
How the fuck
do you know that?

1:19:49.256 --> 1:19:51.355
Yeah, I'll explain it to you.

1:19:51.390 --> 1:19:53.093
But there's more comin',
all right?

1:19:54.426 --> 1:19:55.997
More?

1:19:56.032 --> 1:19:57.196
What have you gotten into?

1:19:57.231 --> 1:20:00.562
- A fuckin' mess.
- Yeah, you're a mess.

1:20:00.597 --> 1:20:03.939
Hey, I called Eddie
to save him for you,

1:20:03.974 --> 1:20:05.534
- for your fucking list.
- Mm-hmm.

1:20:05.569 --> 1:20:08.174
You've been on this case
for a year and have done
nothing.

1:20:08.209 --> 1:20:11.408
I've been on it
for three hours and I
busted it wide open.

1:20:11.443 --> 1:20:14.510
- You should be thanking me.
- "Busted wide open."

1:20:16.921 --> 1:20:18.283
That's an interesting take.

1:20:20.958 --> 1:20:23.288
Oh, fuck. Here they come.
They're coming, let's go.

1:20:27.932 --> 1:20:28.997
Come on.

1:20:56.290 --> 1:20:57.421
Shit.

1:20:59.458 --> 1:21:00.897
Those our guards?

1:21:03.968 --> 1:21:05.297
One, two,
three, four, five, six...

1:21:08.137 --> 1:21:09.499
We got eight slugs.

1:21:12.141 --> 1:21:15.604
- You got your Glock?
- Not when I'm drinking.

1:21:15.639 --> 1:21:17.474
Shit. Here, take this.

1:21:25.055 --> 1:21:26.450
What about Nour?
Does she carry?

1:21:26.485 --> 1:21:29.486
She'll walk right
into this fuckin' mess.

1:21:31.094 --> 1:21:33.061
Fuck, we gotta call her.

1:21:33.096 --> 1:21:35.723
My phone is toast,
these landlines
are shot to shit.

1:21:35.758 --> 1:21:37.164
What about your phone?

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:39.331
Battery died.

1:21:40.233 --> 1:21:42.664
How many drinks
did you have?

1:21:42.699 --> 1:21:47.075
Just enough.
At least we're-we're
safe in here.

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:49.539
We're not,
the security guys have keys.

1:21:55.514 --> 1:21:57.415
We need to barricade
that door.

1:21:58.649 --> 1:22:00.418
Hey, give me a hand
with this shit.

1:22:03.225 --> 1:22:04.554
Come on, come on,
let's go.

1:22:25.610 --> 1:22:27.082
What's it feel like?

1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:29.777
What does what feel like?

1:22:29.812 --> 1:22:32.021
Knowing everyone
wants to kill you.

1:22:48.336 --> 1:22:49.401
Ready?

1:23:20.302 --> 1:23:21.367
Son of a bitch.

1:24:01.508 --> 1:24:02.441
Shane!

1:25:00.270 --> 1:25:01.599
Shane!

1:26:00.759 --> 1:26:03.331
The glass is
bulletproof, asshole.

1:26:03.366 --> 1:26:04.695
Yeah, no shit.

1:26:11.803 --> 1:26:14.474
Well...

1:26:14.509 --> 1:26:17.510
this really isn't
the face-to-face
you expected, is it?

1:26:19.283 --> 1:26:21.283
Open the door.

1:26:22.814 --> 1:26:23.978
I can't do that.

1:26:25.685 --> 1:26:26.750
Justin!

1:26:33.726 --> 1:26:36.859
Hey, let her go, asshole.

1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:42.029
You know
what it would cost.

1:26:42.064 --> 1:26:44.768
Whatever he wants,
don't do it.

1:26:48.576 --> 1:26:50.774
Open the door,
drop your gun,

1:26:50.809 --> 1:26:53.975
or I'll splatter her brains
all over this goddamn window.

1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.749
Slowly. Now!

1:27:00.049 --> 1:27:01.290
All right.

1:27:02.084 --> 1:27:03.622
Get your ass over here.

1:27:09.025 --> 1:27:11.399
- Ah, slowly.
- Okay.

1:27:13.865 --> 1:27:15.634
Don't you try
nothing, either.

1:27:17.836 --> 1:27:20.342
Typical hero shit.

1:27:20.377 --> 1:27:22.575
Always wanna be
the savior of others.

1:27:22.610 --> 1:27:23.906
So predictable.

1:27:26.614 --> 1:27:29.912
Is that the evidence
over there? In one of those?

1:27:29.947 --> 1:27:31.980
Then take your ass over there,
you know what to do.

1:27:32.015 --> 1:27:34.048
Take her ass
with you, too.

1:27:34.083 --> 1:27:35.687
Slowly.

1:27:35.722 --> 1:27:37.051
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1:27:46.799 --> 1:27:47.996
Let's go, let's go.

1:27:52.706 --> 1:27:53.771
Let's go.

1:27:54.774 --> 1:27:55.839
Pull up my files.

1:27:57.106 --> 1:27:58.446
Now!

1:27:59.449 --> 1:28:00.679
Hurry up!

1:28:15.531 --> 1:28:17.960
Even if I delete this,
there's still gonna be
evidence on you.

1:28:21.130 --> 1:28:23.097
Look, you two
will be dead shortly.

1:28:23.132 --> 1:28:24.505
You let me worry
about that.

1:28:35.452 --> 1:28:36.484
Motherfucker.

1:28:46.661 --> 1:28:48.760
- You know...

1:28:49.796 --> 1:28:52.764
If you just woulda listened
to my instructions,

1:28:52.799 --> 1:28:55.734
we coulda ended this
a long time ago.

1:28:55.769 --> 1:28:57.703
And what,
you woulda let us live?

1:28:58.904 --> 1:29:00.475
'Course not.

1:29:01.709 --> 1:29:04.138
That's 'cause you're
a traitorous piece of shit.

1:29:05.074 --> 1:29:08.417
Sticks and stones,
Special Agent Rosa.

1:29:08.452 --> 1:29:09.946
Sticks and stones.

1:29:34.940 --> 1:29:36.544
Who the fuck
did I just shoot?

1:29:36.579 --> 1:29:38.942
And what the fuck
happened in here?

1:29:53.827 --> 1:29:57.125
The kid broke my rule.
He destroyed the wire room.

1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:00.029
From the looks of things,
I'd say he broke
more than just one.

1:30:00.064 --> 1:30:02.834
Hey, I'm sorry
about your wire room.

1:30:02.869 --> 1:30:05.870
But it's not just about
the room, right?
It's about the investigation.

1:30:05.905 --> 1:30:07.608
I'm not sure the brass
are gonna feel the same way.

1:30:07.643 --> 1:30:09.808
Oh, they will...

1:30:09.843 --> 1:30:13.878
once they find out
we got everything it takes
to close this case.

1:30:13.913 --> 1:30:15.847
And how do you figure
we can close the case?

1:30:15.882 --> 1:30:16.947
He found Junior.

1:30:19.886 --> 1:30:23.492
Yeah. Also known as
Deputy Sheriff Roberts.

1:30:25.221 --> 1:30:28.992
Uh, that's something
I didn't expect to hear.

1:30:29.027 --> 1:30:31.533
Yeah, there's a lot
of explaining to do.

1:30:31.568 --> 1:30:33.667
Obviously,

1:30:33.702 --> 1:30:35.999
but we can't close the case
because he's dead

1:30:36.034 --> 1:30:38.001
and he wasn't the target
of the investigation.

1:30:38.036 --> 1:30:40.905
Well, the original target
is also dead.

1:30:40.940 --> 1:30:43.105
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:30:44.581 --> 1:30:46.207
Uh, wait, I'm sorry,
Eddie's dead?

1:30:46.242 --> 1:30:48.275
Yeah.

1:30:48.310 --> 1:30:50.882
He blew himself up
along with all the others.

1:30:50.917 --> 1:30:53.115
Jesus...

1:30:53.150 --> 1:30:54.655
The list.

1:30:55.790 --> 1:30:57.218
Hey, we'll find it.

1:30:57.253 --> 1:30:59.693
It'll be in one of his devices,
forensics can pull it.

1:30:59.728 --> 1:31:02.091
Hey, I hate to break it
to you guys.

1:31:02.126 --> 1:31:04.632
There is no list.
It doesn't exist.

1:31:06.196 --> 1:31:07.734
And how do you know that?

1:31:07.769 --> 1:31:09.131
Eddie.

1:31:10.673 --> 1:31:13.641
I really wish you
would start explaining

1:31:13.676 --> 1:31:15.302
what the fuck
went on tonight.

1:31:15.337 --> 1:31:17.205
Hey, it's all on tape,

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:20.109
assuming we could get
any of this shit to work.

1:31:20.144 --> 1:31:22.177
- What the--

1:31:23.851 --> 1:31:25.312
For your sake,
let's hope it does.

1:31:25.347 --> 1:31:28.656
He saved the case,
not the world.

1:31:28.691 --> 1:31:31.021
Good point.
Plus, let's not forget

1:31:31.056 --> 1:31:34.662
you are directly responsible
for the death of the target
of the investigation,

1:31:34.697 --> 1:31:37.929
ss well as a multi-million
dollar wire room.

1:31:39.702 --> 1:31:42.164
Yeah, I guess
I'm just not cut out
for wire room duty.

1:31:42.199 --> 1:31:44.936
Too much action for me.

1:31:47.072 --> 1:31:48.610
What took you so long?

1:31:50.339 --> 1:31:52.240
Yeah, what did
take you so long?

1:31:52.275 --> 1:31:55.078
I, uh, couldn't find parking.

1:31:55.113 --> 1:31:56.783
See?

1:31:56.818 --> 1:31:58.752
I told you, parking
around here is a bitch.

1:31:58.787 --> 1:31:59.953
No, you're right,
it's pretty bad.

1:31:59.988 --> 1:32:04.659
- They probably towed my car.
- I mean, yeah, probably.

1:32:04.694 --> 1:32:07.354
- Yeah, the meter
expired hours ago.
- Expensive.

1:32:07.389 --> 1:32:08.927
No, don't tell me that.

1:32:09.696 --> 1:32:12.359
- We don't make a lot.

1:32:14.965 --> 1:32:19.773
<i>You've reached Homeland</i>
<i>Security Investigation</i>
<i>Special Agent Justin Rosa.</i>

1:32:19.808 --> 1:32:21.940
