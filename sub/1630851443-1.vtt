WEBVTT

00:13.620 --> 00:15.931
-Ugh, I gotta
get my hair done.

00:15.931 --> 00:18.965
Who the hell do I think I am?

00:18.965 --> 00:21.689
Did I pay the gas bill? Shit.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.275
These motherfuckers
better not be stealing from me.

00:24.275 --> 00:26.310
What time is it? Fuck!

00:26.310 --> 00:27.793
You supposed to be a bad bitch?

00:27.793 --> 00:29.931
You ain't shit.

00:29.931 --> 00:31.586
Where's that damn watch?

00:31.586 --> 00:34.758
I cannot believe my
daddy has Alzheimer's.

00:34.758 --> 00:38.344
I'm gonna whip my sister's ass
if she ain't taking care of him.

00:38.344 --> 00:41.551
This is some bullshit.
I'm not sick.

00:41.551 --> 00:43.724
I'm not taking
these pills and shit.

00:43.724 --> 00:46.931
I'm stressed, okay?
Who the hell are you?

00:46.931 --> 00:48.137
I'm stressed. I'm you.

00:48.137 --> 00:51.103
You ain't me.
You used to be me.

00:51.103 --> 00:52.137
I've gotta call Blue.
Where's Dime?

00:52.137 --> 00:53.551
I need a dog.

00:53.551 --> 00:54.793
Who gonna clean up
after that motherfucker?

00:54.793 --> 00:56.275
I wonder if I
could kill my sister.

00:56.275 --> 00:58.275
I'm stressed.
You strut your shit.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.586
You are James Deville's
daughter, and don't you

01:00.586 --> 01:04.689
let these motherfuckers
forget it.

01:04.689 --> 01:05.896
Hello?

01:05.896 --> 01:07.724
-Hey, Auntie.
I'm out.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.482
Oh, oh, yeah, daddy!

01:43.482 --> 01:47.034
Oh, oh! Mm! Mm!
- That's my pussy.

01:47.034 --> 01:49.103
-Yes, yes, yes!

01:49.103 --> 01:50.758
Oh, mm!

01:50.758 --> 01:53.620
Oh, yes, oh!

01:53.620 --> 01:56.724
Mm, mm, mm...

02:09.379 --> 02:11.827
- Allen is here. Ooh!

02:13.689 --> 02:16.344
- Oh, shit, Allen is here!

02:16.344 --> 02:19.137
- Shit!
I'm gonna fuck him.

02:19.137 --> 02:21.758
- Doc, don't do this.
It's my husband. Hurry up.

02:21.758 --> 02:24.482
- All right.
It's some bullshit.

02:24.482 --> 02:28.310
- Hurry up! Go.
- All right.

02:31.724 --> 02:33.172
- Hurry up!

02:37.931 --> 02:39.586
- Go, go, go, go, go.

02:39.586 --> 02:41.241
-It's some bullshit, girl.

02:54.551 --> 02:56.827
- Hey.

02:56.827 --> 02:58.482
- Hey.
- Baby.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.689
I thought you went to
Detroit for the day.

03:04.689 --> 03:06.931
- Got postponed.

03:06.931 --> 03:08.827
- Yeah. Okay.

03:14.275 --> 03:15.827
- Where are you going?

03:15.827 --> 03:17.482
- I need to shower.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.827
- Well, before you do that--

03:42.931 --> 03:45.034
- So you had him park
around the corner, huh?

03:52.620 --> 03:54.620
Get your ass over here.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.827
Let me go.

03:56.827 --> 03:59.586
- You gonna tell me who
he is right fucking now!

03:59.586 --> 04:03.241
Tell me who he is, bitch!
Tell me who he is!

04:03.241 --> 04:05.896
You gonna tell me who he is.

04:05.896 --> 04:08.206
That's what you want?
That's what the fuck you want?

04:08.206 --> 04:10.172
You gonna tell me who he is!

04:10.172 --> 04:13.482
Who is it? Who is it?

04:13.482 --> 04:16.517
- Please.

04:33.103 --> 04:35.172
- Auntie.

04:35.172 --> 04:37.551
My bad.
Madam.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.724
- Throw that shit
in the car. Let's go.

04:49.034 --> 04:51.551
Use this.

04:51.551 --> 04:54.310
Your phone from
'09 will not work.

04:54.310 --> 04:57.344
- Thanks.

04:57.344 --> 04:59.931
- And thank you
for picking me up.

04:59.931 --> 05:02.862
-No problem.
- No, for real, thank you.

05:02.862 --> 05:05.172
You're the only family
that hasn't disowned me.

05:05.172 --> 05:10.448
- So, 60 days in a halfway
house and you're free.

05:10.448 --> 05:15.068
- Yeah, um, I just gotta find
a job and stack some money.

05:15.068 --> 05:17.448
- You can always work
the door at the club.

05:17.448 --> 05:21.724
- No. Uh, thanks.
Uh, I'll find something.

05:21.724 --> 05:23.344
- All right, well,
if not, let me know.

05:23.344 --> 05:26.758
- Cool
I do need a favor, though.

05:30.689 --> 05:32.862
- Shoot.
- Can we make a quick stop

05:32.862 --> 05:34.793
before I check in
to the halfway house?

05:37.689 --> 05:40.206
What's the address?

05:40.206 --> 05:41.344
-Thanks.

06:00.551 --> 06:03.827
- Mr. Brown, where
is your attorney?

06:03.827 --> 06:05.896
- I don't have one, Your Honor.

06:05.896 --> 06:08.379
- Well, that's not good.
Can you not afford one?

06:08.379 --> 06:10.586
- No, ma'am.
- He's lying.

06:10.586 --> 06:13.103
- Instruct your client
to be quiet, please.

06:13.103 --> 06:15.379
- You need to be quiet.
- I got you.

06:15.379 --> 06:16.793
-Let's hear it.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.689
- Your Honor, Mr. Brown

06:18.689 --> 06:22.413
is working at
a strip club called Eden.

06:22.413 --> 06:27.793
He is an exotic dancer and makes
thousands of dollars a night.

06:27.793 --> 06:31.413
- Is that true?
- No, ma'am.

06:31.413 --> 06:34.896
I make about $1,000 a week.
And I pay her all that I can.

06:34.896 --> 06:36.482
- Ask him what kind
of car he drives.

06:36.482 --> 06:37.620
- Young lady--
-Just ask him.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.137
He's lying!
- Enough!

06:42.000 --> 06:45.137
Mr. Brown, I wanna see your tax
returns or I'm locking you up.

06:45.137 --> 06:47.206
You have seven days to
provide them to this court--

06:47.206 --> 06:48.724
- Seven days?

06:48.724 --> 06:50.000
---or you will
be dancing behind bars.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.724
-Oh, he gets
seven days--

06:51.724 --> 06:53.172
- Quiet! Next case.
-That's some bullshit!

07:15.862 --> 07:17.586
-Mrs. Ellis!
- Yes?

07:20.965 --> 07:23.758
-Mrs. Ellis, I just
wanted to say I'm sorry for--

07:23.758 --> 07:25.310
- Hell, no.
You don't get to apologize.

07:25.310 --> 07:28.689
You get the hell out
of here right now. Leave!

07:31.793 --> 07:34.206
-And I don't
give a shit, Roman.

07:34.206 --> 07:35.724
I want my--

07:37.413 --> 07:39.344
What the fuck!?

07:43.137 --> 07:44.482
- I've been waiting
ten years for this.

07:44.482 --> 07:45.724
Turn around!

07:46.931 --> 07:49.241
I wanna look in your
face when I shoot you.

07:49.241 --> 07:51.241
You got some nerve
coming around here.

07:51.241 --> 07:53.068
You know what you
put my family through?

07:53.068 --> 07:54.931
Do you?

07:57.034 --> 07:59.068
- Don't do it.

07:59.068 --> 08:01.344
-No.
No, Terry, no.

08:01.344 --> 08:03.896
No, if you do this,
they'll lock you up for life,

08:03.896 --> 08:05.517
and I can't lose you too.

08:05.517 --> 08:07.103
Baby...

08:09.000 --> 08:10.620
Baby...

08:11.517 --> 08:13.000
Baby...

08:21.137 --> 08:23.206
- Come on.
Get--get in the car.

08:25.758 --> 08:27.482
What the fuck was
that about, huh?

08:27.482 --> 08:30.862
- I was trying to apologize!

08:30.862 --> 08:33.689
- What?
That was the mom?

08:33.689 --> 08:35.310
- And her brother.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.620
- You gotta give me a head's up

08:38.620 --> 08:40.551
the next time you gonna do
some stupid shit like that.

08:40.551 --> 08:42.965
Yo, you almost
got yourself killed.

08:45.448 --> 08:47.068
- Yes, Madam.

08:57.379 --> 08:59.068
- You should have let
Ms. Patty represent you.

08:59.068 --> 09:00.827
- Man,
if she had come down here

09:00.827 --> 09:02.379
and known I got
a eight-month-old,

09:02.379 --> 09:04.758
she would cut me off.

09:04.758 --> 09:06.344
- Wait, she taking
care of you like that?

09:06.344 --> 09:07.620
- Come on, man.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.724
You got somebody
taking care of you.

09:09.724 --> 09:11.241
- Not like that.

09:11.241 --> 09:14.551
Hey, nigga, you know you
ain't got no tax returns.

09:14.551 --> 09:16.034
Just break her off.

09:16.034 --> 09:18.586
- Break her--look, every
time I go over there,

09:18.586 --> 09:20.103
she wearing new shit,

09:20.103 --> 09:22.172
and my baby running around
in diapers with no shirt.

09:22.172 --> 09:24.137
She ain't doing
shit with the money.

09:24.137 --> 09:28.206
Fuck her. I'm not doing it.
I'm telling you.

09:28.206 --> 09:32.206
- Okay, but look, if the judge
sends Madam some shit saying

09:32.206 --> 09:36.275
she needs to dock your pay,
she gonna be pissed.

09:36.275 --> 09:39.241
She don't like them
white folks in her business.

09:39.241 --> 09:42.517
Nigga, you better
know what you doin'.

09:42.517 --> 09:46.586
- Nigga, I said I got it.
Worry about your shit.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.000
- I got mine covered.

09:59.448 --> 10:01.034
- Uh-uh.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.896
After that shit
you just pulled, no.

10:03.896 --> 10:07.068
Stay your ass in the car.

10:07.068 --> 10:09.586
- Yes, ma'am.
- Give me that.

10:09.586 --> 10:11.862
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

10:28.655 --> 10:31.551
-Hello?

10:31.551 --> 10:33.517
Hello, Carla?

10:36.517 --> 10:38.379
- Hey, Daddy.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.724
- Carla?

10:54.620 --> 10:57.034
Carla, where you at?

10:57.034 --> 10:58.793
Carla?

10:58.793 --> 11:00.758
Girl, where are you at?

11:04.379 --> 11:05.931
Carla?

11:21.068 --> 11:23.344
- Carla! Where are you?

11:25.793 --> 11:27.896
Carla, where the fuck are you?

11:31.758 --> 11:33.206
How you doin'?

11:36.965 --> 11:39.344
I brought you some banana
pudding from the restaurant.

11:41.655 --> 11:44.137
What the fuck?

11:44.137 --> 11:46.000
Where is this fucking girl?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.758
I'm sorry, Daddy, hold on.

11:56.034 --> 11:57.620
- Carla, where the fuck are you?

12:10.482 --> 12:13.379
- Amp, I need you.
-Yes, ma'am.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.862
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, come here.

12:38.448 --> 12:39.862
She left him like this.

12:43.379 --> 12:44.931
- Damn.

12:46.206 --> 12:48.379
- Look, I need you to help
me get him cleaned up, okay?

12:48.379 --> 12:50.137
- Yeah, I got you.

12:54.517 --> 12:56.275
- I can't do this shit.
-Hey.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.482
- Can't do this shit--
- Hey, hey.

12:59.448 --> 13:01.310
I got you, okay?

13:03.379 --> 13:04.482
Hey, Grandpa.

13:04.482 --> 13:06.931
- They left the
birds in the air!

13:06.931 --> 13:08.448
-They did?

13:08.448 --> 13:09.965
-I saw them!

13:10.793 --> 13:13.724
- Is that right?

13:13.724 --> 13:17.310
All right, Grandpa, you gotta
let me go get you showered, hey?

13:17.310 --> 13:22.000
Okay? I'm gonna
move you real slow, okay?

13:22.000 --> 13:24.586
I got you. It's okay.

13:24.586 --> 13:28.344
Alrighty. How you been?

13:28.344 --> 13:31.000
All right, I'm just
gonna take you in back here.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.379
All right.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.344
- You gotta start using condoms.

14:03.344 --> 14:06.000
- Damn. Right out the gate?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.034
And, yes, I do.

14:08.034 --> 14:10.482
Just...sometimes.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.862
- Well, if you did, you
wouldn't be seeing me so often.

14:12.862 --> 14:14.517
We've gone over this.

14:14.517 --> 14:16.862
- Doc, I'm not here
for that today.

14:16.862 --> 14:18.241
- Okay, what is it?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.068
- Look at this dark
spot on my shaft.

14:23.068 --> 14:24.793
What is this?
Is this a STD?

14:24.793 --> 14:28.758
- No. There is a medical term
for it, but I'll spare you.

14:28.758 --> 14:33.724
Basically, this part of
your penis is dying off.

14:33.724 --> 14:36.344
- What the fuck?

14:36.344 --> 14:40.517
- There is a danger in getting
it erect and using cock rings.

14:40.517 --> 14:42.310
It's like you're tying
it with a tourniquet.

14:42.310 --> 14:44.827
You're tying it off
with all the blood in it

14:44.827 --> 14:46.724
and then there's no circulation.

14:46.724 --> 14:49.448
I can even now see that
you've done it just now.

14:49.448 --> 14:52.379
So, you gotta stop doing that.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.517
- Doc, I can't go
out there half beef.

14:54.517 --> 14:56.310
I'm a grower.

14:56.310 --> 15:00.275
- Well, then you're
gonna lose your penis.

15:00.275 --> 15:04.137
- Look, this
is my job, my money.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.172
I can't lose my dick.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.448
- You gotta stop coming
to me asking me for help

15:08.448 --> 15:10.482
and then
not following my advice.

15:10.482 --> 15:14.931
- Then you need to give
me some better advice.

15:14.931 --> 15:20.172
- Okay, if you stop doing that,
then maybe blood will go back

15:20.172 --> 15:22.448
to the region and
you will start to heal.

15:22.448 --> 15:27.413
But as long as you're doing
that, it cannot be helped.

15:27.413 --> 15:31.000
I'm sorry. It's the truth.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.413
- All right, Doc. Okay.

15:44.413 --> 15:45.689
- Fuck!

15:49.482 --> 15:51.413
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:51.413 --> 15:54.241
- Hey, come on, let's--let's--

15:54.241 --> 15:59.655
- Come on, come on.

15:59.655 --> 16:03.827
It's okay, come on.
It's okay, it's okay.

16:06.689 --> 16:09.206
Why the fuck would
she leave him like this?

16:09.206 --> 16:12.655
- He's all clean.
He's all clean. Okay?

16:12.655 --> 16:14.551
- Where the fuck is she?

16:20.034 --> 16:21.724
- Thank you.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.724
What the fuck, Carla?

16:25.724 --> 16:28.000
Why would you leave
Daddy here by himself,

16:28.000 --> 16:29.931
sitting in his own shit?

16:29.931 --> 16:31.586
- Who the fuck are you
talking to like that?

16:31.586 --> 16:32.793
- You!

16:34.931 --> 16:36.413
- Have you been smoking in here?

16:36.413 --> 16:38.758
- Smoke? Bitch,
you worried about smoke

16:38.758 --> 16:40.896
and you got my daddy in here
smelling like this?

16:40.896 --> 16:42.551
- How about you get out?

16:42.551 --> 16:44.000
And then I don't
have to smell smoke

16:44.000 --> 16:45.620
and you don't have
to smell shit?

16:45.620 --> 16:47.482
- Carla. Okay, if you leave
him in here like this again,

16:47.482 --> 16:49.310
I'm calling the police, okay?

16:51.344 --> 16:54.034
- Call the police.

16:54.034 --> 16:55.448
I'm sure they
would love to hear about

16:55.448 --> 16:57.758
all the illegal stuff
that you've got going on.

16:57.758 --> 16:59.758
Huh? How about that?

16:59.758 --> 17:01.379
- Look, Carla, look.

17:01.379 --> 17:04.965
Just, please, can you
let me put him in a home?

17:04.965 --> 17:08.310
- No. You're not putting him
in a home, point made, period.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.551
- Carla, he needs 24-hour care!
Listen to me!

17:10.551 --> 17:12.000
- No, you listen to me!

17:12.000 --> 17:13.931
You just can't stand that
I have power of attorney

17:13.931 --> 17:16.206
over Daddy and the restaurant!
- So what is it? What is it?

17:16.206 --> 17:18.310
Is it money? Is that what
you want? Money?

17:18.310 --> 17:20.310
I will give you
whatever you want, Carla.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.517
Let me put him in a home.

17:22.517 --> 17:25.379
- Why are you worried about it?
You've got money, don't you?

17:25.379 --> 17:27.379
- I do! That's why I wanna
put him in a fucking home!

17:27.379 --> 17:28.931
- Look, it ain't
about the money.

17:28.931 --> 17:31.172
- Then what is it about,
huh? Huh?

17:31.172 --> 17:33.551
- You think I want
your filthy money?

17:33.551 --> 17:36.379
Huh? That's what you think?
I don't want your money.

17:36.379 --> 17:37.413
- Carla--
- So what?

17:37.413 --> 17:39.551
I could end up like Daddy?

17:39.551 --> 17:41.689
You know, you're part of the
reason that he like this anyway.

17:48.379 --> 17:50.862
- How the fuck am I the
reason Daddy has dementia?

17:50.862 --> 17:52.448
Hm?

17:52.448 --> 17:54.551
- I'm not talking
about the dementia.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.551
I'm talking about
you getting him shot.

17:58.655 --> 18:00.620
- Look, that was a
long fucking time ago.

18:00.620 --> 18:03.793
- How long is long enough
to forget about being shot?

18:03.793 --> 18:05.586
Huh?

18:05.586 --> 18:07.275
- Carla, this is my daddy too.

18:07.275 --> 18:08.655
- Bitch, please!
- Yo, hey, come on--

18:08.655 --> 18:10.275
- No, no, no, no,
wait a minute.

18:10.275 --> 18:12.172
What the hell did you bring
him up in here for anyway?

18:12.172 --> 18:13.551
After what he did?

18:13.551 --> 18:16.206
You need to get
the fuck out, too!

18:16.206 --> 18:17.586
You motherfucking murderer!

18:17.586 --> 18:19.620
- Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh.
Chill the fuck out.

18:19.620 --> 18:20.931
- I'mma go.

18:20.931 --> 18:22.965
- No, you not going.
You stay right here.

18:22.965 --> 18:24.344
Look--

18:24.344 --> 18:25.379
-Madam,
can we just go?

18:25.379 --> 18:27.655
- Ah! Madam!

18:27.655 --> 18:29.034
Madam, that's what
they call you now?

18:29.034 --> 18:32.551
Madam. Huh. Some bullshit.

18:32.551 --> 18:34.344
It's just a matter of time
before they gonna find

18:34.344 --> 18:36.310
your ass somewhere dead.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.482
'Cause all the illegal shit
you got going on,

18:38.482 --> 18:40.896
you down at that club,
screwing all them men.

18:40.896 --> 18:44.000
Ha! That's rich!

18:44.000 --> 18:45.275
You gonna go
straight to hell.

18:45.275 --> 18:47.034
-Carla--
- And I can't wait.

18:47.034 --> 18:48.793
I cannot wait, bitch!

18:48.793 --> 18:50.137
- Look, I know
you're my sister--

18:50.137 --> 18:51.482
- Half sister.

18:51.482 --> 18:53.896
- But if I come back here,
Carla--

18:53.896 --> 18:55.310
-What?

18:55.310 --> 18:56.965
- --and my daddy is
sitting in his own shit--

18:56.965 --> 18:58.896
- Come on, please.
- I'm gonna fuck that half up.

18:58.896 --> 19:00.241
Know that!

19:00.241 --> 19:02.344
- Get your fucking
hands off me!

19:02.344 --> 19:04.827
- Come on.

19:04.827 --> 19:08.206
You's a trifling,
nasty-ass bitch, you know that.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.896
- Come on, let's go.
- Here you go.

19:19.482 --> 19:21.551
- Don't bring your
ass back here.

19:23.172 --> 19:26.758
Smoke in my damn house.
What kind of shit is that?

19:26.758 --> 19:28.655
Talking about
smelling some shit.

19:55.379 --> 19:58.310
-- Who's that?
-- Aw, fuck.

20:10.827 --> 20:12.586
- No.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.034
- One day you're gonna
let me dance here.

20:15.034 --> 20:17.000
- My ladies like the men, okay?

20:17.000 --> 20:20.068
- Oh! Your ladies
will like me, trust me.

20:20.068 --> 20:23.551
- I'm sure they would.
- Then let me dance!

20:23.551 --> 20:28.241
- The answer is no, okay?
No. Come on, Amp.

20:28.241 --> 20:29.758
- Yes, ma'am.

20:36.827 --> 20:38.655
- Shit!

20:44.586 --> 20:49.586
- Wow, whoa,
you've really upgraded.

20:49.586 --> 20:53.103
- Yeah. I'm doing all right.

20:53.103 --> 20:55.448
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dime?

20:55.448 --> 20:58.586
- Hi. New dancer?

20:58.586 --> 21:03.413
- No. This is my nephew.
- Oh.

21:03.413 --> 21:04.931
- Look, I need to
get my shit together.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.275
Do me a favor.

21:06.275 --> 21:07.379
Run him down to
the halfway house.

21:07.379 --> 21:08.862
That's the address.
- Okay.

21:08.862 --> 21:10.896
- And then hurry back, okay?
Get the place open.

21:10.896 --> 21:14.103
- Sure.
Your suit is over there.

21:14.103 --> 21:15.896
- Over there.
Why is it not in my office?

21:15.896 --> 21:18.551
- Uh, I didn't have a chance to
drop it off. My apologies.

21:18.551 --> 21:20.068
- All right, bring it
in there before you leave.

21:20.068 --> 21:21.206
- Okay.
- Thank you.

21:21.206 --> 21:22.344
-See you later.

21:22.344 --> 21:23.379
-See you
later, baby boy.

21:23.379 --> 21:26.241
- Oh. Thank you.

21:26.241 --> 21:27.965
For everything.
For real.

21:27.965 --> 21:29.275
- You're welcome.

21:29.275 --> 21:32.206
And I will see
your face later.

21:32.206 --> 21:33.793
- Yes, ma'am.

21:34.965 --> 21:36.310
- Come on.

21:36.310 --> 21:38.137
I gotta get back
before the club opens.

21:38.137 --> 21:39.517
- Yeah.

21:39.517 --> 21:41.241
- Let's go.
- Okay.

21:48.137 --> 21:49.896
-It's right there.

21:49.896 --> 21:52.793
- You do know have that
we have navigation.

21:54.862 --> 21:58.689
- I'm sorry. My bad.
Yeah.

21:58.689 --> 22:03.206
- And here is your
halfway house.

22:03.206 --> 22:04.931
- Yeah.

22:04.931 --> 22:08.551
So, are you gonna
ask why I'm here?

22:08.551 --> 22:11.724
- No. Not my business.

22:11.724 --> 22:15.689
I hope whatever the reason
is, you learned your lesson.

22:15.689 --> 22:20.206
- Yeah. I did.
A thousand times over.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.758
- Then that's all that matters.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.724
- Yeah.

22:24.724 --> 22:29.448
Uh...yo, do you
work at the club?

22:29.448 --> 22:32.758
- I'm the DJ.
And Madam's assistant.

22:32.758 --> 22:35.379
Kind of like a manager.

22:35.379 --> 22:37.137
You gonna be working there?

22:37.137 --> 22:41.965
- Uh, no, nah. I, uh...

22:41.965 --> 22:45.448
I'mma get something of my own
doing something else.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.068
- Really?

22:48.068 --> 22:49.344
- Yeah.

22:49.344 --> 22:51.827
Why you say it like that?

22:51.827 --> 22:56.310
- Well, halfway house,
I assume jail.

22:56.310 --> 22:59.448
And so it's gonna be
hard to find a decent job.

22:59.448 --> 23:04.655
- Yeah. I was in jail, but...

23:04.655 --> 23:06.965
yeah, I don't wanna
be out around the alcohol

23:06.965 --> 23:09.655
and all the
craziness, feel me?

23:09.655 --> 23:12.000
- Hm.
- My granddad,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.551
he owned the club,
I grew up around it.

23:16.551 --> 23:20.068
And I believe that's...
probably why

23:20.068 --> 23:23.793
I'm in the mess
that I'm in, so, yeah.

23:27.172 --> 23:28.758
- Sure.

23:35.103 --> 23:37.206
- Yeah, um,
thank you for the ride.

23:37.206 --> 23:39.413
- Yeah. You're welcome.

23:42.724 --> 23:45.965
- Drive safe.

24:28.413 --> 24:30.103
- Shit, Madam.

24:30.103 --> 24:31.586
You gotta tell me
when you're walkin' up in here.

24:31.586 --> 24:33.034
- Sorry.

24:35.793 --> 24:38.310
- Madam?
-Oh, yeah?

24:38.310 --> 24:42.275
- We got to get this
money out of the club.

24:42.275 --> 24:44.413
- Look, I know, okay?

24:44.413 --> 24:48.827
- You can't keep leaving
this money here overnight.

24:48.827 --> 24:51.758
- It's fine, Blue. Chill.

24:51.758 --> 24:56.413
- Now you know I don't trust
these motherfuckers. Hm?

24:56.413 --> 25:01.689
- What I do know is that if some
shit pops off, you got my back.

25:01.689 --> 25:03.413
So we good.

25:03.413 --> 25:09.137
- You know I would kill every
last motherfucker there is.

25:09.137 --> 25:11.965
- That's for sure.

25:11.965 --> 25:16.000
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
- You look stressed out as hell.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.758
Let me guess.
Your sister and your daddy.

25:22.758 --> 25:25.620
- Look, Blue, I need a lawyer.

25:25.620 --> 25:29.517
- What's wrong with Marcus?
- No, I need someone, um--

25:29.517 --> 25:31.724
someone that does family law.

25:31.724 --> 25:33.724
Doesn't Ms. Patty do that?

25:33.724 --> 25:38.689
You don't want to use her.

25:38.689 --> 25:41.103
- Why not?

25:41.103 --> 25:44.448
- You want a lawyer
that drives a Prius

25:44.448 --> 25:46.896
and takes care of Babyface?

25:46.896 --> 25:50.620
- I want someone that can help.
That's what I want.

25:50.620 --> 25:52.758
I hear she's good, so...

25:55.034 --> 25:56.310
- All right.

25:56.310 --> 25:57.793
I'll see if
Ms. Patty's coming tonight.

25:57.793 --> 25:59.586
- Thank you.

25:59.586 --> 26:01.586
-And Madam?

26:01.586 --> 26:05.344
We gonna get this money
out of here tomorrow.

26:05.344 --> 26:06.965
- Got it. Thank you!

26:21.689 --> 26:25.586
- Yo.
-Hey.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.655
- You all right?

26:27.655 --> 26:29.551
- Yeah, yeah.

26:29.551 --> 26:31.241
-Did he know?

26:31.241 --> 26:33.275
-No, no.

26:33.275 --> 26:35.034
-Come on. You sure?

26:35.034 --> 26:37.482
-No, he--he didn't.

26:37.482 --> 26:40.000
-Okay.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.137
-You coming
by later tonight?

26:42.137 --> 26:44.413
-It'll be late
when I get off work.

26:44.413 --> 26:46.068
-That's okay.

26:46.068 --> 26:50.862
I'll leave the key on the
left side, on the left tire.

26:50.862 --> 26:52.896
-Okay, I'll see you then.

26:52.896 --> 26:54.862
I'm late.
-Okay.

26:54.862 --> 26:58.448
-Let me get in here.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.206
- You fucking a dude
that works at my club?

27:12.172 --> 27:15.413
That bitch is
gonna sell this club.

27:15.413 --> 27:17.931
I'll be as cool
as I can about this.

27:20.758 --> 27:22.344
She gonna see.

27:24.689 --> 27:29.310
You do this shit to me...

27:29.310 --> 27:32.172
I'm gonna tear
this whole bitch down.

27:38.310 --> 27:40.275
- Fuck.

28:11.931 --> 28:14.137
- All right, fellas.
It's roll call.

28:14.137 --> 28:16.413
- Madam.
- El Fuego.

28:16.413 --> 28:18.172
Come on, papi,
you know the drill.

28:18.172 --> 28:22.344
- I know. I just like
when you call me papi.

28:22.344 --> 28:24.000
Te gusta, Madam?

28:25.172 --> 28:26.517
- What is that smell?

28:28.758 --> 28:30.827
Really, Babyface?

28:30.827 --> 28:32.103
So what, you gonna go out there

28:32.103 --> 28:34.275
smelling like
a peppermint again?

28:34.275 --> 28:36.068
I had a customer
complain last week.

28:36.068 --> 28:37.137
Said she couldn't
feel her tongue

28:37.137 --> 28:39.655
after you gave her a lap dance.

28:39.655 --> 28:42.310
- She was licking my leg.

28:45.103 --> 28:47.793
- Glad you could join us, Doc.

28:47.793 --> 28:49.241
Look, you know the rules.

28:49.241 --> 28:51.655
I don't play that late shit.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:51.655 --> 28:55.482
- You have your ass here on time
or not at all, are we clear?

28:55.482 --> 28:57.034
- Crystal.

29:00.413 --> 29:02.758
- Hey, Midnight.

29:02.758 --> 29:05.034
- Madam...

29:05.034 --> 29:07.827
- All right, fellas.
It's game time.

29:07.827 --> 29:10.655
All the elite clients
are at their usual tables.

29:10.655 --> 29:12.172
Show 'em some love.

29:12.172 --> 29:14.000
And let's have a great night.

29:20.689 --> 29:22.551
- Hey, are you all set?

29:22.551 --> 29:25.448
- Playlist locked in, lineup
set, photobooth prepped,

29:25.448 --> 29:28.310
and the pleasantries
are restocked.

29:30.103 --> 29:32.241
- This promotion suits you.

29:32.241 --> 29:33.827
- Thanks for the raise.

29:33.827 --> 29:36.517
I got some plans
for that extra cash.

29:36.517 --> 29:38.068
- You earned it.

29:49.655 --> 29:53.275
-Put your seatbelts on,
ladies.

29:53.275 --> 29:55.758
The show is about to be begin.

31:15.448 --> 31:18.172
-Ladies,
give it up one more time

31:18.172 --> 31:22.724
for these sexy Atlanta hotties!

31:22.724 --> 31:28.655
And yes, ladies, we do
take all major credit cards.

31:28.655 --> 31:33.103
All right, ladies!
Gather your coins.

31:33.103 --> 31:34.517
Our lovely bottle girls

31:34.517 --> 31:37.344
will be coming around
to take your order.

31:37.344 --> 31:42.103
Two-drink minimum, please!
Yeah, y'all heard me.

31:46.310 --> 31:50.448
-Get ready for
the sexiest, the finest,

31:50.448 --> 31:56.310
the longest, strongest stud
that you'll ever see.

31:56.310 --> 32:00.517
Welcome Doc to the stage!

32:05.482 --> 32:08.310
- NE-Okay, now here's
what I want you to do.

32:08.310 --> 32:10.965
I want you to
look me right in my eyes.

32:10.965 --> 32:14.862
And I want you
to tell me exactly

32:14.862 --> 32:16.724
what you want me
to do to you.

32:17.965 --> 32:19.482
You ready?

32:42.551 --> 32:44.448
- Allen's outside.

32:44.448 --> 32:47.172
Says he needs to
have a word with you.

32:47.172 --> 32:49.413
You know he still
won't come in here?

32:49.413 --> 32:53.620
- No. I think seeing Midnight
dancing naked traumatized him.

32:53.620 --> 32:56.655
I'll go
see what he wants.

32:56.655 --> 32:58.000
Be right back.

33:22.551 --> 33:24.000
- Madam.

33:28.827 --> 33:31.172
Lovely to see you.
- Allen.

33:33.931 --> 33:37.724
- We got an offer on Club Eden.

33:37.724 --> 33:39.379
- I'm not interested.

33:42.275 --> 33:45.620
- I haven't even told
you the number yet.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.206
- My club is not
for sale, Allen.

33:47.206 --> 33:50.448
- Ah, our club.

33:50.448 --> 33:53.931
Might I remind you we
have a 51/49 split, Madam.

33:53.931 --> 33:56.862
Meaning, I can and will

33:56.862 --> 34:00.551
entertain any reasonable offer.

34:00.551 --> 34:05.931
Hey, hey, hey, nothing personal.
It's just business.

34:05.931 --> 34:09.310
- Club Eden is mine.

34:09.310 --> 34:12.103
Don't fuck with me, Fisk.

34:12.103 --> 34:17.000
- Madam, they're offering double
what we paid for this building.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.551
- Who's they? Hm?

34:20.827 --> 34:24.275
- Gene.

34:24.275 --> 34:27.965
- Gene Marks?
My old boss?

34:29.931 --> 34:34.034
Over my dead body, no.

34:34.034 --> 34:36.172
- It's a good deal, Madam.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.862
- For who? Hm?

35:21.517 --> 35:24.482
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

35:24.482 --> 35:26.310
The motherfucker lost his mind.

35:26.310 --> 35:27.517
Think I'm selling my club.

35:27.517 --> 35:29.827
That's crazy.
- Fuck no.

35:29.827 --> 35:32.137
You worked too
goddamn hard to get here.

35:32.137 --> 35:33.655
- I know.

35:33.655 --> 35:35.931
- He just mad because
Doc is fucking his wife.

35:37.586 --> 35:40.000
- What?
- Yeah.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.275
- Does he know?

35:41.275 --> 35:43.310
- No, you know
you'd fuck him up.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.689
- No, he don't know Doc.

35:45.689 --> 35:47.620
He don't come around
here enough to know him.

35:47.620 --> 35:49.586
- Mm.
- You know what?

35:59.620 --> 36:03.310
- Hey, Tina, it's Madam.
-Yeah?

36:03.310 --> 36:06.448
- I'm gonna ask you this one
time and then I'm gonna send

36:06.448 --> 36:09.241
someone to pay you a visit.

36:09.241 --> 36:10.965
-Please don't.

36:10.965 --> 36:13.206
- Does Allen know
you're fucking Doc?

36:15.827 --> 36:18.275
Answer me, bitch.

36:18.275 --> 36:19.620
-Yes.

36:20.655 --> 36:22.827
- When did he find out?

36:22.827 --> 36:24.137
-Today.

36:24.137 --> 36:27.310
He wants me to get him
to come over after work.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.448
- Where? To your house?

36:29.448 --> 36:31.310
-Yeah.

36:32.862 --> 36:35.241
- All right.

36:46.862 --> 36:48.862
- How's it going?

36:48.862 --> 36:50.344
- There's Ms. Patty.

36:50.344 --> 36:52.413
Is that who you want
to represent you?

36:53.724 --> 36:54.896
- Chill, okay?

36:54.896 --> 36:56.758
I haven't even
talked to her yet.

36:58.034 --> 36:59.965
- Okay.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.965
- Hey, Ms. Patty.
- Hey!

37:06.965 --> 37:10.896
- Can we share Babyface
tonight with someone else?

37:10.896 --> 37:15.482
- Aww, okay.
- Please. Thank you.

37:15.482 --> 37:17.379
Come here, Face.

37:17.379 --> 37:20.068
So there's someone
in VIP asking for you.

37:20.068 --> 37:24.344
Go get the money for the house.
She's got on a hell of a rock.

37:24.344 --> 37:26.034
- I got you.
- Thank you.

37:26.034 --> 37:29.482
- Oh, and I heard that
Roman is in the parking lot.

37:29.482 --> 37:31.517
- Is he in the
parking lot right now?

37:31.517 --> 37:35.034
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

37:35.034 --> 37:36.931
Go get that money.

37:41.862 --> 37:44.068
- You wanted to see me?

37:44.068 --> 37:45.344
- Midnight, do you remember

37:45.344 --> 37:47.689
a promoter I
told you about, Roman?

37:47.689 --> 37:50.517
The one that's been dodging me?
- Yeah.

37:50.517 --> 37:56.448
- Well, right now,
he is over at Club Drip

37:56.448 --> 38:00.000
buying bottles and tables.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.620
He owes me $50,000.

38:03.620 --> 38:05.206
- Yeah, let me go have
a conversation with him.

38:05.206 --> 38:06.517
- Mm-mm.

38:08.034 --> 38:09.793
I can handle it.

38:09.793 --> 38:12.000
I do want you and Blue to
come over there with me, though.

38:14.448 --> 38:17.310
- Hm. I get to watch. Okay.

38:37.379 --> 38:39.862
- Hey, there.

38:39.862 --> 38:42.517
- Mm, hm-hm.

38:42.517 --> 38:44.344
I was down there.

38:44.344 --> 38:48.241
It looked like a lot more than a
thousand dollars a week to me.

38:48.241 --> 38:51.000
- Ah, shit!

38:51.000 --> 38:52.965
- Now, let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

38:56.620 --> 39:00.344
If I don't like
what you giving...

39:00.344 --> 39:03.241
your ass going to jail.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.896
- Damn.

39:08.344 --> 39:11.379
- Now get on your knees.

39:48.758 --> 39:50.448
- Where's my fucking money, huh?

39:50.448 --> 39:52.413
- What the fuck?

39:53.758 --> 39:55.758
- You've been dodging me, Roman.

39:55.758 --> 39:57.862
Haven't been answering my calls.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.517
Apparently you think
I'm the kind of bitch

39:59.517 --> 40:01.448
you can get around
to getting back to.

40:01.448 --> 40:02.862
- Please, Madam--

40:04.068 --> 40:06.413
- Don't you fucking
bleed on me.

40:06.413 --> 40:08.137
If I have to come back and
have another conversation,

40:08.137 --> 40:11.068
Roman, this shit gonna
feel like a massage.

41:12.103 --> 41:14.517
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

41:14.517 --> 41:16.137
- Hey, Doc, come here.

41:18.586 --> 41:21.931
What do you have
planned for the evening?

41:21.931 --> 41:24.000
- Nothing really.
Um, I'm tired.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.965
I'mma just go home
and just lay low.

41:28.241 --> 41:30.655
- Okay.
- All right.

41:40.931 --> 41:43.137
- Yo, Fuego, I'm headed over
to do a private party tonight

41:43.137 --> 41:45.275
Madam set up.
You wanna roll?

41:45.275 --> 41:48.724
- Tonight?
- Yeah, a grand plus tips.

41:48.724 --> 41:50.793
Brah made three
stacks last time.

41:50.793 --> 41:52.620
- You've gotta hump them
chicks for that kind of cash?

41:52.620 --> 41:55.413
- Meh, they just wanna be held.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.862
Naked.

41:58.379 --> 42:02.275
- No, thanks. I'm good.

42:02.275 --> 42:03.896
- More money for me.

42:16.896 --> 42:18.655
- Yo, why is it so dark in here?

42:24.310 --> 42:26.862
- 'Cause you're 'bout
to die, motherfucker.

42:26.862 --> 42:29.068
- Oh, shit!

42:29.068 --> 42:32.241
- No, nigga, that would be you.

42:32.241 --> 42:33.620
- Fuck.
