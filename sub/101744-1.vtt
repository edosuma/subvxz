WEBVTT

06:59.171 --> 07:01.606
Where am I?

07:56.862 --> 07:59.331
Hey, hey. Whoa!

07:59.364 --> 08:01.199
Hey, stop!
Stop right there!

08:01.233 --> 08:02.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, stop.

08:02.434 --> 08:04.336
Stop, stop, stop.

08:05.203 --> 08:06.471
Stop.

08:13.178 --> 08:15.347
What the hell's
going on out here?

08:22.487 --> 08:23.488
Tex.

08:24.923 --> 08:25.924
Tex!

08:28.593 --> 08:30.195
I'm just eating
some canned chili, Sarge.

08:30.228 --> 08:31.696
You want some?

08:31.730 --> 08:33.664
Get your ass out here and tell
me what this woman's saying.

08:36.001 --> 08:37.635
Hey, woman,
what you saying?

08:41.173 --> 08:42.640
She ain't saying
shit, Sarge.

08:43.241 --> 08:45.143
Ask her who she is,

08:45.177 --> 08:47.312
and what's with
that stiff in that cart?

08:48.213 --> 08:49.548
Copy that.

08:55.954 --> 08:57.022
Okay.

08:57.656 --> 08:58.657
Huh?

09:17.609 --> 09:19.177
What'd she say?

09:19.211 --> 09:21.479
Um, I don't
really know, Sarge.

09:21.513 --> 09:22.881
I... I think
she said...

09:22.914 --> 09:25.584
I think she said,
um, they fixed him,

09:25.617 --> 09:27.419
or something like neutered
him, or something.

09:27.452 --> 09:28.954
She stitched
him up.

09:30.088 --> 09:31.890
You're crap
for an interpreter.

09:33.024 --> 09:33.959
Sarge,

09:33.992 --> 09:36.728
this woman has very poor
communication skills.

09:36.761 --> 09:37.596
Figure it out.

09:37.629 --> 09:40.065
Sarge, he's not dead.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.488
What?

10:06.491 --> 10:08.493
What's she saying?

10:08.526 --> 10:10.296
I think she said
he got hit by a comet.

10:10.329 --> 10:11.963
Jesus, Tex.

10:27.245 --> 10:28.381
What?

10:28.413 --> 10:30.515
She said he has
a hole in his temple.

10:30.548 --> 10:31.883
A hole in his temple?

10:33.618 --> 10:37.022
Yup, I'm right about that.
I know that part.

10:39.358 --> 10:40.558
No.

10:47.999 --> 10:49.801
Ah! No.

10:50.535 --> 10:52.103
It's a Buddhist temple.

10:52.137 --> 10:53.438
It has a hole in it.

10:53.471 --> 10:55.840
And then some dead guy
comes through it.

10:57.242 --> 10:58.476
Yeah.

10:58.510 --> 10:59.811
Thought you knew
the goddamn language.

10:59.844 --> 11:01.414
Man, I thought
I did too, man.

11:01.446 --> 11:03.615
That <i>Burmese for Dummies</i>
is just not working out.

11:03.648 --> 11:04.950
Just one
of their myths?

11:09.254 --> 11:10.789
You're making me look
real bad now.

11:40.386 --> 11:41.953
You the plutonium mule?

11:49.260 --> 11:50.528
Where am I?

11:51.464 --> 11:54.065
We talking
nuclear facility?

11:55.401 --> 11:56.935
What?

11:56.968 --> 11:58.404
You'll tell us.
What's your name?

12:02.974 --> 12:04.075
You have a name?

12:07.380 --> 12:09.281
Well...

12:09.315 --> 12:10.882
while you're
working on it,

12:11.417 --> 12:12.617
I'm working on it too.

12:13.818 --> 12:15.553
I'm with
Army Intelligence.

12:19.157 --> 12:20.225
And I'm good.

12:24.696 --> 12:26.598
<i>How did you wind up
with that injury?</i>

12:28.300 --> 12:29.634
Hmm?

12:29.667 --> 12:31.536
<i>Where did
you get the stitch job?</i>

12:36.308 --> 12:37.343
Good talk.

12:37.376 --> 12:38.810
Well, in the meantime,

12:38.843 --> 12:40.545
I'm running you through
facial recognition.

12:40.578 --> 12:42.881
It's an international
database.

12:44.249 --> 12:45.583
Your fingerprints...

12:46.117 --> 12:48.119
we've got those, too.

12:48.153 --> 12:51.656
So we'll find out.
Or you can just tell me.

12:54.592 --> 12:55.960
I can't remember.

12:57.128 --> 12:58.797
Hmm.

12:58.830 --> 13:00.299
What are you
doing in Burma?

13:01.300 --> 13:02.567
Burma?

13:04.702 --> 13:06.237
I thought
it was Myanmar.

13:06.271 --> 13:08.307
Very funny.

13:10.875 --> 13:16.515
If what you're doing here
has anything to do

13:16.549 --> 13:18.049
with what
I'm doing here...

13:18.983 --> 13:20.585
I've got a problem
with that.

13:22.288 --> 13:24.423
Are you a ronin?
Merc for hire?

13:24.457 --> 13:25.790
Did you sneak in
the yellow cake,

13:25.824 --> 13:27.258
or are you in it deeper?

13:28.561 --> 13:29.894
Cake?

13:31.497 --> 13:32.697
Hmm.

13:34.999 --> 13:36.768
We found this
in your outfit.

13:39.505 --> 13:40.705
That yours?

13:46.144 --> 13:47.413
Yeah. Thanks.

13:47.446 --> 13:49.180
Hmm. You're welcome.

13:51.683 --> 13:52.984
Where's the other stuff?

13:54.252 --> 13:55.321
What stuff?

13:56.754 --> 13:58.089
I'm not sure.

14:02.428 --> 14:03.895
What do you use this for?

14:04.963 --> 14:07.031
Uh, I don't know.
Locate radiation.

14:17.642 --> 14:19.378
This is doable.
I just...

14:20.245 --> 14:21.547
I need more time.

14:21.580 --> 14:22.714
What about that
tattoo he's got?

14:22.747 --> 14:24.015
You ask him
about that?

14:24.048 --> 14:26.251
Not yet. I'm still trying
to get him to talk.

14:27.386 --> 14:28.853
Well, let's
get on it, then.

14:28.887 --> 14:30.755
It's too soon.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.023
He's got a massive
head trauma.

14:32.056 --> 14:34.225
Look,
we can cry about it later.

14:34.259 --> 14:35.394
Can we do this now?

14:45.103 --> 14:46.137
Come on.

16:31.577 --> 16:33.177
It's a truth serum.

16:34.879 --> 16:37.316
Who are you working for?

16:39.050 --> 16:42.521
They call it the Valley
of the Temples, right?

16:46.659 --> 16:48.694
You know what
I don't understand?

16:48.727 --> 16:50.995
How the hell
are you still alive?

16:54.132 --> 16:55.166
We already know
that there are

16:55.199 --> 16:57.703
excessive levels
of plutonium there.

16:57.736 --> 16:59.037
We know this.

16:59.070 --> 17:01.039
We don't think the
Burmese know about it.

17:01.072 --> 17:03.676
And the Chinese,
they'd be too smart

17:03.709 --> 17:06.210
to try to sneak this by,
so they don't know.

17:07.211 --> 17:08.614
But you know.

17:08.646 --> 17:10.013
Who are you
working for?

17:10.815 --> 17:12.849
Who are you working for?

17:14.353 --> 17:15.554
Why are you here?

17:20.992 --> 17:22.461
I'm here to do a job.

17:22.493 --> 17:23.561
Good.

17:24.430 --> 17:25.497
Bingo.

17:26.765 --> 17:30.134
The fisherman's wife
brought me here.

17:32.671 --> 17:34.172
She thought
you'd help me.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.007
With what?

17:41.580 --> 17:44.115
All right,
everybody out.

17:44.148 --> 17:45.950
I can take it
from here.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.218
You heard me.
Everybody out.

17:48.152 --> 17:49.321
Move.

17:49.688 --> 17:51.155
Move!

17:51.189 --> 17:52.857
All right,
let's cut the crap,

17:52.890 --> 17:54.526
because I already
know your deal.

17:55.594 --> 17:56.628
Just...

17:59.063 --> 18:00.632
they move so fast.

18:06.070 --> 18:07.539
They move so fast.

18:09.575 --> 18:11.008
You don't even
stand a chance.

18:12.411 --> 18:14.513
You don't stand
a chance against what?

18:23.789 --> 18:25.123
What was that about?

18:30.396 --> 18:32.297
I think he's telling
the truth.

18:33.030 --> 18:34.600
He really lost
his memory.

18:35.634 --> 18:37.636
Or he's just
one hell of an operative.

18:39.103 --> 18:41.573
Or we try
a softer approach.

18:42.775 --> 18:44.008
I'll take him out
for some air.

18:50.214 --> 18:51.717
Huh.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.328
Anything coming
back to you?

19:04.430 --> 19:05.664
Just a headache.

19:07.466 --> 19:09.635
I was hoping,
with some walking around,

19:10.736 --> 19:12.304
visual stimuli...

19:13.271 --> 19:16.875
Look,
we are classified,

19:16.909 --> 19:18.811
and we needed to know
if you're on our side.

19:18.844 --> 19:20.144
Against who?

20:01.252 --> 20:02.253
Hmm.

22:32.871 --> 22:34.473
Come on! Come on!

22:36.308 --> 22:37.309
Go!

22:56.193 --> 22:57.496
We got to go.

22:58.296 --> 23:00.632
- Let's go!
- We need backup!

23:06.705 --> 23:09.240
Hey. Hey

23:09.908 --> 23:11.275
Where are we going?

23:36.635 --> 23:37.836
Ow!

25:04.823 --> 25:06.725
Come.

25:36.855 --> 25:38.356
Jake!

25:39.191 --> 25:41.560
Don't move, Jake.

25:41.593 --> 25:44.297
Don't even think about
moving without all of us.

25:44.362 --> 25:46.932
Jake, look at me.
Tell me you understand.

25:46.965 --> 25:50.001
You know you're risking everybody's
life by being here, right?

25:50.035 --> 25:51.403
You're supposed to be dead.

25:51.436 --> 25:54.105
We got a plan. We don't
stick to it, everything goes to shit.

25:54.139 --> 25:55.674
What happened to you?

26:10.989 --> 26:12.357
Jake...

26:15.794 --> 26:17.262
Who are you?

26:17.296 --> 26:19.698
Who are we?
What are you doing?

26:19.731 --> 26:21.833
- Who wants to know?
- I do.

26:21.867 --> 26:23.602
And who are you?

26:23.635 --> 26:25.770
Are you really asking me
who I am?

26:25.804 --> 26:26.938
Yeah.

26:26.972 --> 26:27.973
Really?

26:31.276 --> 26:32.577
You don't know them?

26:40.252 --> 26:41.887
Son of a bitch.

26:51.930 --> 26:53.164
What happened to you?

26:53.965 --> 26:56.001
Hey. Hey, Jake.

26:57.269 --> 26:58.670
Where'd you go?

28:15.246 --> 28:16.948
Do not move.

31:54.832 --> 31:56.502
<i>Charlie 2-0,</i>
<i>this is Charlie 2-1.</i>

31:56.535 --> 31:57.969
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

31:59.371 --> 32:01.105
<i>Who the hell
were those Jedi Knights</i>

32:01.139 --> 32:02.774
<i>that just took out
my entire unit?</i>

32:03.609 --> 32:05.710
I don't know.
But they knew me.

32:05.743 --> 32:06.778
Called me Jake.

32:06.811 --> 32:08.846
Huh. Well,
there's some progress.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.950
Who are they?
Why are they here?

32:11.983 --> 32:13.718
I'm pretty sure
I belong with them.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.655
What did they want?

32:16.689 --> 32:18.990
It's not important.
You have to leave the area.

32:19.023 --> 32:20.825
You're asking all
the wrong questions.

32:23.094 --> 32:25.564
<i>He said
his name is Jake.</i>

32:25.598 --> 32:27.065
<i>He's still foggy
from the shock,</i>

32:27.098 --> 32:29.767
but he did say that we have
to leave the area.

32:30.436 --> 32:31.403
We? What do you mean, us?

32:31.437 --> 32:33.004
He's just saying
we abort the whole mission?

32:33.037 --> 32:34.973
He's insistent.

32:36.575 --> 32:38.377
What are you not
telling me?

32:38.410 --> 32:41.846
Let's just say it's not just
about plutonium levels anymore.

32:42.548 --> 32:44.048
This is just
a cover story?

32:44.082 --> 32:47.185
The story is,
you follow my orders.

32:47.218 --> 32:48.454
What about Jake?

32:49.688 --> 32:50.989
He's coming with us.

32:51.022 --> 32:52.358
What, in that mental state?

32:52.391 --> 32:53.925
I'm not
leaving him here.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.509
Geiger counter's
going crazy.

34:23.514 --> 34:25.317
It's not that kind
of radiation.

34:28.353 --> 34:30.322
Well, what kind
of radiation is it?

34:41.500 --> 34:42.735
You owe me.

34:42.768 --> 34:44.570
Try to make a move,
I shoot you.

34:44.603 --> 34:45.937
Is that clear?

34:47.871 --> 34:49.842
There's something
in there.

34:49.873 --> 34:51.377
They don't know
what they're facing.

34:51.409 --> 34:52.578
Shut up.

34:52.610 --> 34:54.145
They'll get
themselves killed.

35:00.885 --> 35:03.020
- Move.
- Two down.

35:03.489 --> 35:04.857
We need backup.

35:10.895 --> 35:12.096
Come on, hurry!

35:24.476 --> 35:25.577
We're three down!

35:27.145 --> 35:28.946
That's four down!

35:30.816 --> 35:32.384
Chuck, get me out of here!

35:32.751 --> 35:34.853
Aah! No!

35:34.887 --> 35:36.755
No!

35:36.789 --> 35:38.290
What the hell is this?

35:39.056 --> 35:40.158
We call in
an air strike

35:40.191 --> 35:41.326
and tell them
we're being attacked

35:41.360 --> 35:42.994
by some dudes
from outer space.

35:43.027 --> 35:44.329
You want a Section 8?

35:44.363 --> 35:45.531
Yes! Yes!

35:45.564 --> 35:46.698
If that means staying alive.

35:46.732 --> 35:48.232
- No.
- Then call me crazy.

35:48.266 --> 35:49.301
Call it in!

35:49.334 --> 35:50.268
He's after me.

35:50.302 --> 35:52.638
Oh, well, then,
everybody say bye to Jake.

35:52.671 --> 35:53.705
Bye, Jake!

35:53.739 --> 35:55.908
Let's go, come on! Oh!

35:55.940 --> 35:57.709
- Shit.
- We have to get out of here.

35:57.743 --> 35:59.143
You think?

36:43.689 --> 36:44.756
Hmm.

37:07.546 --> 37:09.515
Oh, my God.

37:15.554 --> 37:17.322
Hey.

37:17.356 --> 37:19.391
We have to go back
for Captain Sand.

37:19.424 --> 37:20.425
There's no time.

37:23.362 --> 37:24.363
Hmm.

37:46.418 --> 37:48.320
Did you hear that?

38:03.535 --> 38:04.636
Whoo.

38:06.638 --> 38:09.041
Wow! Man, you did it!

38:09.073 --> 38:10.442
Whoo, you did it, man.

38:10.475 --> 38:13.345
Come on.
Come on, give me some!

38:13.378 --> 38:15.781
Man, you know how famous
you're gonna be, dawg?

38:15.814 --> 38:17.950
You're gonna be so famous right now.
You know how big this is?

38:17.983 --> 38:19.284
This is bigger than Bigfoot.

38:19.318 --> 38:20.319
Move!

39:08.667 --> 39:09.801
Whoa!

39:15.707 --> 39:16.808
Jake!

40:00.852 --> 40:02.253
Who are you?

40:05.290 --> 40:06.491
You don't know?

40:07.559 --> 40:08.593
No.

40:11.262 --> 40:12.864
Forgot a few things, huh?

40:15.367 --> 40:16.435
I'm you
in a few years

40:16.468 --> 40:18.269
if you don't get
your shit together.

40:18.670 --> 40:19.738
You know me?

40:19.771 --> 40:20.806
I am you.

40:26.078 --> 40:27.179
I don't get it.

40:27.211 --> 40:28.680
No one ever gets
what I mean.

40:31.248 --> 40:34.419
Now, someone in your situation
only has two choices.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.588
Be like me,

40:37.055 --> 40:38.924
or a warrior.

40:45.130 --> 40:46.665
That's my
favorite chair.

40:46.698 --> 40:48.333
I knew you'd
find it comfortable.

40:55.841 --> 40:56.975
Ho-ho-ho.

40:57.976 --> 40:59.444
Get off my piano.

41:06.184 --> 41:07.886
But it's
a pretty good life.

41:07.919 --> 41:09.588
I mean, I've got
my hobbies.

41:09.621 --> 41:11.690
I make hats
out of newspapers.

41:11.723 --> 41:12.724
Look at this.

41:14.426 --> 41:16.862
You see the attention
to detail?

41:16.895 --> 41:18.997
It's an art. It's a craft.

41:23.401 --> 41:26.638
But it takes time,
and I got plenty of time.

41:26.671 --> 41:28.607
And if I get
a little hungry,

41:28.640 --> 41:31.042
they usually throw me
some food down at the Valley.

41:31.843 --> 41:33.311
The Valley?

41:33.345 --> 41:34.379
The Valley of the Temples.

41:34.412 --> 41:35.680
You don't even
remember that?

41:37.816 --> 41:39.351
Yeah.

41:39.384 --> 41:40.919
That's where
it all goes down.

41:47.559 --> 41:48.827
You know, I'm going to
have to figure out a way

41:48.860 --> 41:50.128
to smarten you up.

41:50.162 --> 41:51.663
Must have been
a pretty bad fall.

42:03.909 --> 42:05.010
He wanted you here.

42:05.043 --> 42:06.344
Who?

42:06.378 --> 42:08.980
The Poet Warrior
in the sci-fi sense.

42:09.447 --> 42:10.816
The Space Man.

42:21.326 --> 42:24.362
He's the one that
gave us Jiu Jitsu.

42:25.864 --> 42:27.065
Jiu Jitsu?

42:27.098 --> 42:30.035
You are, right this minute,

42:30.068 --> 42:32.771
exactly where
he wants you to be,

42:33.205 --> 42:34.573
and it is over.

42:35.106 --> 42:36.408
Ball in mitt.

42:36.441 --> 42:38.076
Game, match, set.

42:38.910 --> 42:40.045
Checkmate.

42:41.314 --> 42:42.514
Whoo!

42:48.353 --> 42:49.788
See, I can fly too.

43:10.475 --> 43:12.777
Now you're going to face
Brax off right this time.

43:13.312 --> 43:14.813
Brax?

43:14.846 --> 43:16.147
He respects that.

43:16.815 --> 43:17.883
He plays fair.

43:22.821 --> 43:25.257
But if you put
some bullshit soldiers

43:25.291 --> 43:26.825
on the field
with him again,

43:27.626 --> 43:29.594
he'll kill you
in the worst way.

43:44.876 --> 43:45.977
Nice.

43:55.120 --> 43:56.421
Jake?

43:57.856 --> 44:00.191
We're talking.
Can't you see we're talking?

44:02.694 --> 44:04.796
You're gonna want
to come with us, Jake.

44:04.829 --> 44:07.432
No. His mind's
all messed up.

44:07.465 --> 44:08.867
He's crazy,

44:08.900 --> 44:10.035
like me.

44:13.505 --> 44:15.473
We don't have
a lot of time, Jake.

44:15.507 --> 44:17.542
You know what
this is, right?

44:18.411 --> 44:19.611
You know us.

44:20.545 --> 44:21.913
I don't think he does.

44:23.448 --> 44:25.617
Jake, you come with us.

44:26.184 --> 44:27.719
Come with us.
Come on.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.522
Come on, you can
trust me. Come on.

45:08.626 --> 45:10.061
Let them know
we found him.

45:11.496 --> 45:13.064
Rendezvous at
the temple.

45:48.533 --> 45:51.102
Hey, maybe I could
get something to eat.

45:51.803 --> 45:55.374
Like a noodle
or a pickle.

45:55.408 --> 45:56.975
Somebody give
Wylie some food.

46:26.004 --> 46:27.072
Jake...

46:29.274 --> 46:30.642
he comes from there.

46:31.843 --> 46:35.013
It's the comet you see
in the sky right now.

46:35.046 --> 46:38.817
It passes over the earth
every six years,

46:38.850 --> 46:41.152
and causes a portal
right here.

46:42.053 --> 46:43.088
But when it's open,

46:43.121 --> 46:45.723
we get a visitor
from a distant galaxy.

46:45.757 --> 46:47.258
I mean, he actually
comes here from a place

46:47.293 --> 46:51.596
millions of light years away
looking for a fight with you,

46:51.629 --> 46:52.831
the chosen Jiu Jitsu.

46:54.766 --> 46:56.435
And if he
doesn't get it,

46:56.469 --> 46:59.237
he stays
and he kills everything.

46:59.270 --> 47:02.674
He taught our ancestors
how to fight him.

47:03.476 --> 47:04.943
Then you took an oath...

47:06.312 --> 47:07.879
and that's how he did it.

47:09.614 --> 47:12.050
That's how he gave you
Jiu Jitsu.

47:20.326 --> 47:22.093
Yeah, I could eat.

48:22.820 --> 48:24.189
Jake...

48:26.292 --> 48:27.359
Hey.

48:27.825 --> 48:29.093
Pay attention.

48:29.127 --> 48:30.529
Keep your
head on straight.

48:30.563 --> 48:31.963
I said, suit him up.

48:34.032 --> 48:35.033
Hmm.

48:40.772 --> 48:43.174
If you cover yourself
completely with this,

48:44.310 --> 48:45.311
Brax can't see you.

48:47.680 --> 48:49.214
Look at me.
Look at me.

48:50.782 --> 48:52.116
I don't know
how much you forgot,

48:52.850 --> 48:54.185
but it better not be this.

49:08.032 --> 49:09.033
Look up.

49:09.834 --> 49:11.470
You see it?
Twelve o'clock.

49:17.175 --> 49:19.478
By the time it gets to those
trees, it'll be dark.

49:20.878 --> 49:23.616
Fighting Brax in the
dark is not what we want.

49:23.649 --> 49:25.451
We want to bring the
fight to him before then.

49:27.852 --> 49:29.355
Thanks to you, we got to
climb up this hill

49:29.388 --> 49:30.989
with the Geiger counters.

49:31.022 --> 49:32.691
We got to find him,
we got to lure him out,

49:32.725 --> 49:33.925
get the edge.

49:35.661 --> 49:37.929
What happens after dark?

49:37.962 --> 49:40.299
If Brax doesn't square off
and kill us by then,

49:40.332 --> 49:42.334
the hole doesn't close
and he stays.

49:43.569 --> 49:44.836
Everyone dies.

49:45.304 --> 49:46.305
Everyone.

49:49.907 --> 49:52.311
You used to say the fight
was worth dying for, Jake.

49:53.845 --> 49:55.046
All the time.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.181
I believed you.

49:59.485 --> 50:00.486
Try to keep up.

50:04.822 --> 50:06.558
A lot of us thought it would
be you who has the chance

50:06.592 --> 50:07.992
to take Brax out.

50:09.093 --> 50:11.262
You look puzzled.
Are you puzzled?

50:11.297 --> 50:13.898
I mean, I get it. I'm puzzled.
I'm real puzzled.

50:13.931 --> 50:16.769
There's a comet, there's a
portal, there's Brax.

50:16.801 --> 50:18.036
Why don't I remember
any of this?

50:18.069 --> 50:20.104
Don't worry so much about
what you don't remember.

50:20.138 --> 50:21.172
Which is
pretty much everything.

50:21.205 --> 50:22.608
The main thing
is to focus.

50:22.641 --> 50:24.710
- You remember how to do that?
- Maybe.

50:24.743 --> 50:26.512
Maybe?
You've been preparing

50:26.545 --> 50:27.912
for this fight
your entire life.

50:27.945 --> 50:29.947
That makes sense.
Fighting that son of a bitch

50:29.981 --> 50:31.115
makes all the sense
in the world.

50:31.149 --> 50:32.484
Yeah, you got
to fight him.

50:32.518 --> 50:33.885
Even if it kills you,
you got to fight him.

50:33.918 --> 50:35.487
You get your honor back.

50:35.521 --> 50:37.356
Now, Brax fights
nine fighters.

50:37.389 --> 50:39.625
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,

50:39.658 --> 50:40.958
and then he goes home.

50:40.992 --> 50:43.127
But if any of the fighters
refuse to fight him,

50:43.629 --> 50:44.896
he devours.

50:44.929 --> 50:47.932
He devours anything that
walks, flies, crawls.

50:47.965 --> 50:51.069
I mean, he destroys
entire towns and villages.

50:51.102 --> 50:53.806
Now, you...
you, you, you, you, you.

50:53.838 --> 50:56.608
You maybe might actually
have to die.

50:56.642 --> 50:59.043
But as long
as you die bravely,

50:59.077 --> 51:00.646
no one else will have to.

51:00.679 --> 51:01.846
Not for another six years.

51:01.879 --> 51:05.917
That is alien politics
five through fifteen.

51:06.585 --> 51:07.919
You said
he fights nine.

51:07.952 --> 51:09.355
Why is there
only eight of us?

51:10.289 --> 51:11.824
Like I said,
don't worry so much

51:11.856 --> 51:13.024
about what you
don't remember.

51:13.057 --> 51:14.892
- I want to know.
- Keep moving.

51:15.728 --> 51:17.995
- We lost a guy.
- What happened?

51:18.731 --> 51:19.931
Brax happened.

51:20.733 --> 51:22.133
Brax.

51:22.166 --> 51:24.001
Brax. You know
who that is, right?

51:26.971 --> 51:29.073
Breathe. You got this.

51:29.808 --> 51:31.075
You got this.

51:39.518 --> 51:40.652
What are you doing?

51:41.720 --> 51:43.154
Hey.

51:43.187 --> 51:44.490
I said,
stay together.

51:45.056 --> 51:46.090
Don't lag behind.

51:46.124 --> 51:47.493
You want to keep up
with this crowd,

51:47.526 --> 51:48.594
you don't slack.

51:53.231 --> 51:55.032
You don't think we should
go look for him?

51:57.503 --> 51:59.638
This was your plan, Jake.

51:59.671 --> 52:00.672
Your plan.

52:02.608 --> 52:03.642
I had a plan?

52:03.675 --> 52:05.310
Don't tell me.

52:06.144 --> 52:07.579
You forgot the plan?

52:08.313 --> 52:10.081
It was
your plan, Jake.

52:10.114 --> 52:11.350
He'll get it.

52:11.383 --> 52:13.017
Are you trying
to confuse him?

52:13.050 --> 52:15.086
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

52:15.119 --> 52:17.021
Remember what I said.
You're the rabbit.

52:17.054 --> 52:20.459
You just follow me, okay?
Keep moving.

52:20.492 --> 52:22.561
Don't get distracted.
This is all just noise.

52:22.594 --> 52:24.630
Just rise above it.
Come on.

52:28.434 --> 52:29.601
Split up here.

52:32.170 --> 52:35.707
Victor, Franz, Forbes, Jake,
you take that road.

52:35.741 --> 52:37.108
We'll meet you up
on the hill.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.978
Wylie, it's time
for you to fall back.

52:41.979 --> 52:43.282
You see Brax,
you send up a flare.

52:43.315 --> 52:45.350
He'll be after Jake,
you put him on point.

52:46.083 --> 52:47.286
We'll meet you up there.

52:48.420 --> 52:49.488
We good?

52:49.521 --> 52:51.088
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

52:51.590 --> 52:52.591
Let's go.

52:57.128 --> 52:58.497
Was that necessary?

52:59.263 --> 53:00.566
You know it was.

53:45.577 --> 53:47.646
Jake, I'm sorry, man.

53:49.548 --> 53:50.582
It's not your fault.

53:51.783 --> 53:52.784
Don't worry about it.

54:06.465 --> 54:07.699
Keep moving.

54:07.733 --> 54:08.867
What are you
talking about?

54:08.901 --> 54:10.101
Just keep moving.

54:10.536 --> 54:11.537
No.

54:12.136 --> 54:13.372
No, we're not leaving you.

54:15.072 --> 54:16.775
Jake, you're the rabbit.

54:17.676 --> 54:18.677
I got this.

54:25.884 --> 54:27.084
Go.

54:34.793 --> 54:35.794
It's my time.

01:01:13.024 --> 01:01:14.025
Hey.

01:01:14.993 --> 01:01:16.027
Wake up.

01:01:22.267 --> 01:01:23.902
I got a license to kill you.

01:01:24.636 --> 01:01:26.204
No expiration date.

01:01:27.839 --> 01:01:29.941
So you're gonna tell me
everything you know.

01:01:34.946 --> 01:01:36.848
And I'll tell you
everything I know.

01:01:52.764 --> 01:01:53.932
Okay.

01:01:56.267 --> 01:01:58.570
Nobody knows
the mission but me.

01:02:00.038 --> 01:02:02.574
I've been clocking that thing
for 24 years

01:02:02.607 --> 01:02:04.175
for Army Intelligence.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.847
What's your procedure?

01:02:09.647 --> 01:02:11.716
Your crew goes in
one by one?

01:02:12.584 --> 01:02:14.152
That's pretty much
how it is, yeah.

01:02:15.488 --> 01:02:16.888
That's not good enough.

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:19.924
I lost too many good men...

01:02:21.126 --> 01:02:22.127
and women...

01:02:23.396 --> 01:02:24.963
following orders.

01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:30.835
You can do it different.

01:02:31.836 --> 01:02:34.039
He can heal
from almost anything.

01:02:35.006 --> 01:02:37.075
But it takes him
about five or six seconds

01:02:37.108 --> 01:02:38.543
before he's whole again.

01:02:39.744 --> 01:02:41.546
That's your window.

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:43.315
That's enough time
for you.

01:02:54.726 --> 01:02:56.094
Get to it, soldier.

01:03:41.106 --> 01:03:43.675
Do you ever ask
yourself the question,

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.245
"Why am I still alive?"

01:03:47.278 --> 01:03:48.847
So you think
this is funny?

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.082
He's playing with his
food, don't you think?

01:03:52.183 --> 01:03:53.685
He's like a killer whale

01:03:53.718 --> 01:03:57.122
in the frozen waters
of the Arctic with a seal.

01:03:57.155 --> 01:03:59.558
He fools with its head
and then he kills it.

01:03:59.592 --> 01:04:01.759
It's horrible.
Pull up a chair.

01:04:03.962 --> 01:04:04.963
Okay.

01:04:05.464 --> 01:04:06.664
You know something?

01:04:07.566 --> 01:04:10.135
I know something
you don't know.

01:04:10.168 --> 01:04:14.672
I know that the Space Man
actually likes you.

01:04:15.574 --> 01:04:16.641
He likes you

01:04:16.674 --> 01:04:19.612
because he's paying you
a very high honor.

01:04:19.644 --> 01:04:21.813
And I hate to think
that's undeserved.

01:04:22.281 --> 01:04:23.915
A high honor?

01:04:23.948 --> 01:04:26.050
Oh, yeah. He's saving
the best for last

01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:27.486
out of respect
for your skills.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.187
It's an enormous honor.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:32.891
And he bestows it upon you
in spite of what you did.

01:04:34.393 --> 01:04:35.394
What did I do?

01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:40.265
I was there.
I saw it firsthand.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.621
What you're saying
is that I'm a coward.

01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:51.357
Everyone's saying it.

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:52.624
Just not to my face.

01:07:54.393 --> 01:07:57.563
The story will be told
for generations.

01:07:57.596 --> 01:08:00.432
Just like with me,
six years ago.

01:08:00.466 --> 01:08:03.868
I flinched when I faced
him, just like you.

01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:07.105
Yeah, I begged for my life,

01:08:07.138 --> 01:08:08.940
but he thinks I'm crazy.

01:08:08.973 --> 01:08:11.042
There's no honor
in killing crazy.

01:08:12.611 --> 01:08:13.878
You actually ran.

01:08:13.911 --> 01:08:16.448
And by running,
you allowed him to come here

01:08:16.482 --> 01:08:17.915
and kill the innocent.

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:19.451
That's on you.

01:08:21.453 --> 01:08:22.453
But this time,

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.221
we have a plan.

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:27.091
We?

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.361
So you're one of us?

01:08:34.633 --> 01:08:36.067
So tell me this,
old man.

01:08:38.035 --> 01:08:39.371
Will I end up
like you?

01:08:43.742 --> 01:08:45.943
No, you won't live
long enough.

01:08:45.977 --> 01:08:47.379
You won't make it
through the day.

01:08:48.946 --> 01:08:50.749
Hmm. Or he won't.

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:53.385
That's more like it.
That's the spirit.

01:08:54.152 --> 01:08:55.888
Brax has no use
for a coward.

01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.656
He likes
brave fighters.

01:08:57.689 --> 01:08:58.890
Once he has you pegged
as a coward,

01:08:58.923 --> 01:09:01.292
you become like
a sporting hunt to him.

01:09:01.326 --> 01:09:03.761
He's like Manolete,
the clownish bullfighter,

01:09:03.796 --> 01:09:05.330
and you're the bull.

01:09:05.363 --> 01:09:06.865
He'll want to make
an example out of you,

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.634
prove a point,
mess with your head first,

01:09:08.667 --> 01:09:10.001
and then he'll kill you.

01:09:19.977 --> 01:09:21.546
See?
It's already started.

01:09:22.212 --> 01:09:23.916
He's trying to vex you.

01:09:23.948 --> 01:09:25.350
He can stop trying.

01:09:39.765 --> 01:09:41.433
You okay?

01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:46.037
You know, there is one other
way I failed to mention.

01:09:46.805 --> 01:09:47.840
Be a way for you
to make up

01:09:47.872 --> 01:09:49.341
for everything
that went before.

01:09:51.108 --> 01:09:52.743
You could kill
the son of a bitch.

01:09:58.383 --> 01:09:59.217
You're alive.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:00.586
Son of a bitch.

01:10:04.556 --> 01:10:06.325
I'm okay.

01:10:06.991 --> 01:10:08.293
You're not okay.

01:10:08.327 --> 01:10:09.361
We should get him
under the brush.

01:10:09.394 --> 01:10:10.596
He may still
think he's dead.

01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:13.732
What about you?
Where'd you come from?

01:10:13.765 --> 01:10:14.999
He put me here.

01:10:16.267 --> 01:10:17.469
Forbes?

01:10:17.503 --> 01:10:18.504
Dead.

01:10:19.771 --> 01:10:20.772
Shit.

01:10:23.775 --> 01:10:25.176
Comet's moving.

01:10:25.209 --> 01:10:26.612
We got to get
this done now.

01:10:27.044 --> 01:10:28.246
We move.

01:10:29.882 --> 01:10:31.316
Whatever happens...

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.217
You got
something to say?

01:10:34.419 --> 01:10:35.487
...just remember
the one thing

01:10:35.521 --> 01:10:37.756
you always have
with Jiu Jitsu...

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.227
Leverage.

01:10:46.565 --> 01:10:47.633
Move.

01:12:01.406 --> 01:12:02.441
Aah!

01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:59.765
Aah!

01:14:04.663 --> 01:14:06.298
Aah!

01:24:08.266 --> 01:24:10.134
He saved our lives.

01:24:11.804 --> 01:24:15.507
I always knew he was faking
like he was crazy,

01:24:15.541 --> 01:24:17.309
so he could help you.

01:24:18.477 --> 01:24:20.346
What are you
talking about?

01:24:21.846 --> 01:24:23.382
You really don't know?

01:24:27.919 --> 01:24:29.588
He was your father.

01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:59.984
He didn't
want me to know.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.955
Hey, you're hurt.

01:25:03.988 --> 01:25:05.691
Can you breathe?

01:25:05.724 --> 01:25:08.126
Almost.
Let's go.

01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:10.629
No, no, no, slow down.
Slow down, you have a big wound.

01:25:10.662 --> 01:25:11.896
Come here.

01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:34.319
Oh, come on.

01:25:34.353 --> 01:25:36.187
Don't tell me you two
are about to get on

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:39.056
in this tight-ass temple,
that's real unholy.

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:41.627
Not to mention we got a
goddamn Martian on the loose.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:42.927
She's hurt.

01:25:43.862 --> 01:25:45.864
Oh, she's hurt.
My guys are all dead.

01:25:45.898 --> 01:25:48.801
I've been driving around trying
to get a head count, I got <i>nada.</i>

01:25:48.834 --> 01:25:50.869
I figured these two
might be of some use.

01:25:50.903 --> 01:25:53.204
Not to mention
these bad boys right here.

01:25:58.075 --> 01:25:59.944
She going to need a good stitch
job, or what?

01:25:59.977 --> 01:26:03.282
Yeah, let's get her
to a safe place.

01:26:03.315 --> 01:26:05.417
There's no safe place
around here.

01:26:08.085 --> 01:26:11.657
Hey, so you guys are like
some ninja alien killers, huh?

01:26:11.690 --> 01:26:12.925
Jiu Jitsu.

01:26:12.957 --> 01:26:15.561
Ah, that's why you wear
those funky-ass outfits.

01:26:15.594 --> 01:26:17.796
Well, come on, tell me.
You guys are part of some, like,

01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:19.932
secret agency
government probe, right?

01:26:19.964 --> 01:26:21.467
To take down
Martians and shit?

01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:23.167
I've been reading
about that stuff, man.

01:26:23.201 --> 01:26:25.102
Ever since I started
translating in the Army, man,

01:26:25.136 --> 01:26:26.705
I'm finding all kind
of crazy stuff.

01:27:02.106 --> 01:27:03.675
What is it?

01:27:09.146 --> 01:27:11.316
He said something
about it kills the pain.

01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:14.185
I don't need it.

01:27:25.931 --> 01:27:27.265
What?

01:27:27.299 --> 01:27:29.301
This has been very traumatic for
me, okay?

01:27:29.334 --> 01:27:31.336
I still have nightmares from
when I try to milk our pet bull.

01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:33.271
You think I won't need
therapy from this shit?

01:27:45.884 --> 01:27:48.420
How do you blow such
big holes in him with those arrows?

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:51.122
Blasting caps on the tips.

01:27:57.529 --> 01:27:58.764
Here's a thought.

01:28:01.198 --> 01:28:02.668
Get me wrapped.

01:28:07.238 --> 01:28:08.507
What'd she say?

01:28:09.273 --> 01:28:11.275
She says she's ready to go.

01:28:20.986 --> 01:28:22.354
What?

01:28:22.387 --> 01:28:25.324
I think she said she needs
to stretch, run and exercise.

01:28:25.357 --> 01:28:26.391
Yup.

01:28:29.361 --> 01:28:30.395
What?

01:29:04.863 --> 01:29:05.864
Go.

01:30:28.613 --> 01:30:29.614
Aah!

01:32:31.336 --> 01:32:33.939
<i>He was your father.</i>

01:33:06.104 --> 01:33:07.439
Come on.

01:34:17.842 --> 01:34:19.678
<i>But it takes him
about five or six seconds</i>

01:34:19.711 --> 01:34:21.479
<i>before he's whole again.</i>

01:34:21.513 --> 01:34:23.581
<i>That's your window.</i>

01:34:48.374 --> 01:34:49.841
Jake!

01:35:02.288 --> 01:35:03.688
Jake!

01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:45.256
Mm.

01:36:59.371 --> 01:37:00.805
Are we good?

01:37:02.073 --> 01:37:03.875
Everything cool?

01:37:03.908 --> 01:37:06.077
It's not another one,
is it?

01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:08.079
You got to be safe
about these things.

01:37:08.113 --> 01:37:09.714
You never know.

01:37:09.747 --> 01:37:11.683
It'll be like Goldilocks
and the three aliens out here,

01:37:11.716 --> 01:37:12.784
you know what I mean?

01:37:12.817 --> 01:37:14.587
Mama alien, baby alien.

01:37:14.619 --> 01:37:16.489
Whoo!

01:37:16.522 --> 01:37:18.089
Who wants a drink?

01:37:18.457 --> 01:37:19.691
Ooh!

01:37:33.771 --> 01:37:35.173
Coming right up.

01:37:44.916 --> 01:37:46.784
See you in six years.
