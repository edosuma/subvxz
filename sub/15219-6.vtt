07:17.392 --> 07:21.761
I'm not asking you to change
everything you do, Rachel.
Just don't play those records.

07:21.830 --> 07:25.459
You talk about rock and roll
like it's some kind of
contagious disease, like... like...

07:25.534 --> 07:27.695

07:27.769 --> 07:30.465

would say to this.

about what rock and roll
is gonna do to the kids in this city.

07:44.953 --> 07:47.183

Chick, stay out of this.
<i>[Al]</i>
<i>Believe it, Sam.</i>

07:50.392 --> 07:52.292
A lot of people did
back in the '50s.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.988
Well, that's ridiculous.
Chick.

07:55.063 --> 07:58.829
You think it's ridiculous
to be concerned about
the welfare of our children?

07:58.900 --> 08:01.300
Or the undermining
of family values?

08:03.205 --> 08:05.139
No, it's just that...

08:05.207 --> 08:07.675
What we're talking about,
it's just music.

08:07.742 --> 08:09.937
What we are talking about...

08:10.011 --> 08:12.479
is the future of America.

- Is this guy a dinosaur or what?

08:17.853 --> 08:20.344
No, sir.
I don't think it's funny.
Well, I do!

08:20.422 --> 08:22.583
So did I.
I thought it was hysterical.

08:22.657 --> 08:26.115
I think what Rachel
is trying to say...

08:26.194 --> 08:28.822
is that the idea that music...

08:28.897 --> 08:32.094
can make people
misbehave is wrong.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.260
And even if it were true,
which it isn't,

08:34.336 --> 08:36.861
isn't this just simply a matter
of... of people not...

08:36.938 --> 08:40.806
listening to a particular radio station
that might be playing music...

08:40.876 --> 08:42.707
that they might not want
heard played?

08:42.777 --> 08:45.871
<i>You don't have kids,</i>
<i>do you, Mr. Howell?</i>

08:45.947 --> 08:48.415

Soon as you turn your back,
they do exactly what they want.

08:50.952 --> 08:53.580
And then some.

08:53.655 --> 08:56.988
I'm sure that you
and the other parents...

08:57.058 --> 09:01.495
have instilled in your children
proper family values...

09:01.563 --> 09:04.430
so that they know what's right
and what's wrong,

09:04.499 --> 09:07.662
so that no matter
what they listen to,
they'll do the right thing.

09:07.736 --> 09:10.364
Rachel, I didn't want
to have to do this.

09:10.438 --> 09:12.929
Here comes the windup.
You leave me no choice.

09:13.008 --> 09:16.774
Here comes the pitch.
I'm pulling my advertising.

09:16.845 --> 09:21.873
From now on, my paper
and my hardware store will do
their radio spots elsewhere.

09:21.950 --> 09:25.215
Oh, come on, Fred!
And believe me,

09:25.287 --> 09:27.517
so will a lot
of other businesses.

09:27.589 --> 09:29.682
I carry a fair amount
of weight in this town.

09:29.758 --> 09:32.192
Yeah, and a lot of it's
hangin' over your belt.

09:32.260 --> 09:35.923
Go ahead. Pull your advertising.
See if I care.

09:37.132 --> 09:41.364
You may not. But what about
all the other people who work
for you and their families?

09:41.436 --> 09:43.563
I'm not gonna stop
playing rock and roll.

09:43.638 --> 09:47.301
- Maybe you won't have a choice.
- What do you mean by that?

09:47.375 --> 09:49.969
I mean that tomorrow
at the city council meeting,

09:50.045 --> 09:54.311
I intend to propose a law
that will ban rock and roll
from being played over the airwaves.

09:54.382 --> 09:56.646
<i>[Sam]</i>
<i>You can't do that!</i>

09:56.718 --> 09:58.447

10:00.522 --> 10:02.717
Can he?

10:02.791 --> 10:06.625
I don't know. Uh, maybe they could
pass some kind of weird blue law.

10:14.102 --> 10:17.196
What are you looking at?

10:17.272 --> 10:19.866
I was just thinking that you...

10:19.941 --> 10:22.842

10:25.580 --> 10:28.071
Thank you.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.276
Oh, and Chick...
Yes?

10:30.352 --> 10:32.877
If you're late again tomorrow,
you're fired.

10:38.260 --> 10:40.854

10:45.734 --> 10:48.726
Who... Rachel.
Uh... Oh. Oh.

10:48.803 --> 10:52.000
Uh, well, Ziggy figures
there's a 92.4% certainty...

10:52.073 --> 10:54.837
that you're here to save her.

10:54.909 --> 10:57.776
Well, I hope she doesn't die,
because the way I feel right
now, I just might let her.

10:57.846 --> 11:00.371
No, she doesn't die.
But the station does.

11:00.448 --> 11:02.382
In about a year.

11:02.450 --> 11:05.942
And then after that,
her life goes right downhill.

11:06.021 --> 11:09.457
So in order to save Rachel,
I gotta save the station.

11:09.524 --> 11:12.186
Yeah. You gotta make
the station number one.

11:12.260 --> 11:14.421
The only way to do that
is rock and roll.

I'd like to read you something
that, uh, we dug out of the news files
here from the <i>Peoria Dispatch.</i>

24:31.158 --> 24:35.356
It was written a couple of weeks
ago by your friend and mine,
Frederick R. Beaman.

24:35.429 --> 24:39.388
"I am not against music.
I love music.
But rock and roll is not music.

24:39.467 --> 24:44.598
"It is nothing more than the half-articulate
speech of a group of people
of extreme dress and style...

24:44.672 --> 24:48.733
whose radical intention
is to excite and inflame
the youth of our community."

24:48.809 --> 24:50.834
Now I would like
to read you something...

24:50.911 --> 24:55.314
written by a group
of long-haired,
weirdly dressed radicals...

24:55.382 --> 24:58.010
in 1791.

24:58.085 --> 25:00.212
It's called
the First Amendment.

25:00.287 --> 25:03.051
<i>"Congress shall make no law</i>
<i>respecting an establishment of religion...</i>

25:03.124 --> 25:06.992
<i>"or prohibiting the</i>
<i>free exercise thereof,</i>
<i>or abridging the freedom of speech,</i>

25:07.061 --> 25:10.224
"or of the press,
or the right of the people
peaceably to assemble...

25:10.297 --> 25:12.891
and to petition the government
for a redress of grievances."

25:12.967 --> 25:16.767
Now, I believe in the freedom of the press,
and I believe that Mr. Beaman
has a right to print...

25:16.837 --> 25:19.305
whatever he wants to
about rock and roll.

25:19.373 --> 25:22.035
But the First Amendment also
guarantees freedom of speech.

25:22.109 --> 25:27.046
And since Mr. Beaman also admits
that rock and roll is at least
in some form speech...

25:27.114 --> 25:30.572
<i>uh, "half articulate speech,"</i>
<i>to be exact</i>...

25:30.651 --> 25:34.348
<i>then I guess that rock and roll</i>
<i>is also guaranteed</i>
<i>by the First Amendment,</i>

25:34.421 --> 25:38.255
and we'd just like
to exercise that right.

40:29.983 --> 40:34.545
<i>Mr. Beaman, what exactly</i>
<i>prompted your campaign</i>
<i>against rock and roll?</i>

40:34.621 --> 40:36.555
It's simple.
I'm an American.

40:36.623 --> 40:41.856
I want to keep what's good
and right about America intact.
Anything that threatens that, well...

40:41.928 --> 40:45.329
I'm a fighter, not a watcher.
You can say that again.

40:45.398 --> 40:48.299
Dagnabbit, if they keep this up,
I'm gonna have to change my name to...

40:48.368 --> 40:51.633
[All Cheering]

40:54.474 --> 40:57.238
They're back on the air.
Damn it to hell!

<i>[Howling Continues]</i>

41:16.196 --> 41:19.461
But what you're really here for is,
uh, rock and roll.

<i>(music) [Rock And Roll]</i>

41:31.244 --> 41:33.439
<i>(music) [Continues]</i>

41:53.032 --> 41:55.694
Mayor, you oughta consider
rescinding your law.

41:55.768 --> 41:57.702
We're not rescinding
anything!

41:57.770 --> 42:01.206
If you'd done what you were supposed
to do and arrested Rachel when I told you,
none of this would've happened.

42:01.274 --> 42:04.437
Arresting somebody's the last thing
we should do. That's liable to set
this whole thing off.

42:04.511 --> 42:09.608
I thinkJake's right, Fred.
The last thing we need in front
of all this press is trouble.

42:09.682 --> 42:12.310
My God. Some of this press
is even national.

42:12.385 --> 42:16.219
What we need is to show them
that we know how to handle
things like this!

42:16.289 --> 42:20.316
If you don't, I do.
Fred, what
are you doing?

42:47.954 --> 42:52.220
- Leave my station alone!
- You broke the law, Rachel!

42:52.292 --> 42:55.284
A stupid law, Fred!
Couch. Come on.

42:55.361 --> 42:57.886
Sam, forget the couch.
That's not gonna stop Beaman.

42:57.964 --> 43:00.398
Oh, I think
I'm gonna get a hernia.
You got any better ideas?

43:00.466 --> 43:04.664
- Well, I'm just following you!
- I got Ziggy workin' on it.

43:04.737 --> 43:07.365
- As a matter of fact, look!
- [Humming]

43:08.508 --> 43:11.875
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Come on.
I know a way to stop Beaman.

43:15.949 --> 43:17.917
Frank, stop it!

43:29.128 --> 43:31.892
I'd like to read you something
we found in our news files...

43:31.965 --> 43:34.092
dated August 16, 1945,

43:34.167 --> 43:37.261
<i>the day after theJapanese surrendered,</i>
<i>and World War II ended.</i>

43:37.337 --> 43:39.771
<i>"The guns are silent now,</i>

43:39.839 --> 43:42.433
"and so are many of the men
whose hands once held them.

43:42.508 --> 43:45.875
<i>"Never again will they see</i>
<i>their wives or mothers.</i>

43:45.945 --> 43:48.277
<i>"Never again will they hear</i>
<i>their children laugh.</i>

43:48.348 --> 43:51.681
"And never again will they smell
the sweet scents of home.

43:51.751 --> 43:53.616
"And for what?

43:53.686 --> 43:56.985
<i>"For what did</i>
<i>these husbands and fathers,</i>
<i>these brothers and sons,</i>

43:57.056 --> 44:00.321
<i>"give their lives so many</i>
<i>thousands of miles from home?</i>

44:00.393 --> 44:04.659
"I say it was for one word,
and that word is 'freedom.'

44:04.731 --> 44:06.824
"The freedom to pray.

44:06.899 --> 44:09.959
<i>"To write, to speak,</i>
<i>to feel, to be.</i>

44:10.036 --> 44:13.472
<i>"As we see fit, and not as others</i>
<i>would dictate to us.</i>

44:13.539 --> 44:16.667
"To this freedom, which has been
so dearly bought for us,

44:16.743 --> 44:21.271
"it is up to us, the living,
to dedicate our lives
and our futures...

44:21.347 --> 44:23.645
to its eternal protection."

44:26.552 --> 44:29.453
These words were written
by Frederick Beaman,

44:29.522 --> 44:33.458
<i>the editor</i>
<i>of the</i> Peoria Dispatch.

44:33.526 --> 44:37.485

that Mr. Beaman...

44:37.563 --> 44:41.158
would see it in his heart that...

44:41.234 --> 44:44.067
[Exhales]
all we are looking for here...

44:44.137 --> 44:47.800
