06:15.200 --> 06:17.731
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:20.003 --> 06:22.316
Did you just come from the race track?

06:22.907 --> 06:24.537
- Did you win?
- No.

06:26.445 --> 06:28.758
- How much is this?
-$2.

06:31.551 --> 06:34.791
- Will you be racing again?
- Going to California.

06:35.584 --> 06:38.592
- I've got to be there by Friday.
- California?

06:38.688 --> 06:40.634
I always wanted to go to California.

06:40.688 --> 06:42.249
- Really?
- Yes.

06:42.724 --> 06:44.797
-It's nice there.
- Is it?

06:46.397 --> 06:47.990
I thought it would be.

06:48.295 --> 06:50.643
- Is your name Violet?
- Yes, it is.

06:53.636 --> 06:56.368
- Who made the necklace?
- I made it.

07:00.975 --> 07:03.256
You think you'd want to come with me?

07:05.246 --> 07:06.875
I don't even know you.

07:11.650 --> 07:13.554
Please?

07:22.830 --> 07:24.003
Please?

07:27.969 --> 07:29.561
Please come with me.

09:05.722 --> 09:07.102
I like your face.

09:26.939 --> 09:29.550
- Okay, you have to get your things.
- Okay.

09:30.177 --> 09:31.558
Five minutes.

09:32.082 --> 09:33.255
Okay.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.233
Hey, Violet.

09:43.056 --> 09:44.195
Come here.

10:01.241 --> 10:03.143
I like you a whole lot.

10:03.276 --> 10:04.949
I like you, too.

10:12.317 --> 10:14.423
- Okay, hurry up.
- I will.

15:46.956 --> 15:51.588
Hi, Mrs. Lemon? My name is Bud.
I'm a friend of Daisy's.

15:51.925 --> 15:55.092
I used to live next door here,
a long time ago.

15:55.397 --> 15:56.566
Who are you?

15:56.928 --> 16:00.599
I'm Bud Clay. I grew up next door.
I used to live right next door.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.537
My father was David Clay.
My mother was Norma Clay.

16:03.603 --> 16:05.438
- You want to come in?
- Sure.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.301
- Is that Daisy's bunny?
- Yes.

16:37.003 --> 16:38.562
That's her bunny.

16:41.505 --> 16:44.637
I haven't heard from her. She hasn't called.

16:47.246 --> 16:49.771
I don't know why she hasn't called.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.923
I wish I knew why.

17:08.798 --> 17:10.993
The bunny looks so small still.

17:12.366 --> 17:15.042
She's had that bunny rabbit a long time.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.413
That's the cutest bunny.

17:22.141 --> 17:23.738
Where do you live now?

17:23.976 --> 17:27.644
I live in Los Angeles.
Daisy and I lived together in Los Angeles.

17:29.519 --> 17:32.761
We have a small house and...

17:32.818 --> 17:35.914
- Do you have any children?
- No, we haven't had children.

17:35.985 --> 17:38.460
- No?
- No.

17:40.694 --> 17:42.593
We were going to have a baby.

17:43.993 --> 17:45.736
And what happened?

17:55.673 --> 17:57.141
I don't know.

18:10.685 --> 18:12.486
I don't know what happened.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.375
Who are you?

18:21.496 --> 18:23.205
I don't remember you.

18:23.265 --> 18:25.575
- You don't remember me?
- No, I don't.

18:28.102 --> 18:31.744
I grew up next door. I remember you.

18:34.343 --> 18:36.015
I lived right next door.

18:36.076 --> 18:39.175
I'm Daisy's friend from childhood.

18:39.914 --> 18:43.252
And then we lived together in California.

18:44.786 --> 18:48.970
You visited us once. Do you remember
when you came to California to visit us?

18:53.558 --> 18:57.808
Maybe. It's been such a long time.
I don't remember.

18:58.363 --> 19:01.642
But maybe I did visit, once or twice.

19:11.210 --> 19:13.818
I used to play in the backyard all the time.

19:14.648 --> 19:18.257
We had a pool at my house,
but it wasn't nice.

19:24.155 --> 19:28.662
- I would go in your pool with Daisy.
- With Daisy?

19:29.222 --> 19:32.470
Yes, she would let me swim in your pool.

19:32.896 --> 19:35.023
We would go in there all the time.

19:36.431 --> 19:38.903
- Your daughter liked swimming.
- Yes.

19:39.403 --> 19:42.933
- She liked it a lot.
- Yes.

19:48.246 --> 19:49.269
Yes.

19:58.685 --> 20:00.361
I have to get going now.

25:28.556 --> 25:30.230
These are the bunnies?

25:34.161 --> 25:35.574
Are these adult bunnies?

25:35.629 --> 25:38.190
Yes, pretty much. They're almost full-grown.

25:46.168 --> 25:47.764
How old is this bunny?

25:48.270 --> 25:50.505
Around one, two months.

25:52.610 --> 25:54.443
What's the longest a bunny can live?

25:54.511 --> 25:56.254
For five to six years.

25:57.580 --> 25:59.325
- Five or six years?
- Yes.

25:59.782 --> 26:01.980
- That's the most they can live?
- Yes.

26:02.785 --> 26:05.258
Even if you feed it special food
or something?

26:05.321 --> 26:08.056
No, they won't live more than
five or six years.

26:08.258 --> 26:10.866
- All bunnies? Even this kind here?
- Yes.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.486
Okay. Thanks.

26:45.957 --> 26:47.153
Fifty-one!

26:49.993 --> 26:51.167
Fifty-one?

30:27.158 --> 30:28.500
You okay?

48:47.600 --> 48:49.705
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

48:49.765 --> 48:51.750
You looking for a date?

48:52.104 --> 48:53.905
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

49:28.935 --> 49:31.644
- Do you want a date?
- No, sorry.

49:32.236 --> 49:34.308
- You sure?
- I'm sure. Sorry.

49:55.998 --> 49:57.498
Would you like to go out?

49:59.230 --> 50:01.789
- No, I'm just driving around.
- Okay.

51:06.857 --> 51:08.725
You change your mind?

51:22.570 --> 51:24.702
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

51:26.580 --> 51:28.571
- I like your necklace.
- Thanks.

51:28.713 --> 51:30.821
That's your name? Rose?

51:32.182 --> 51:34.562
- That's a nice name.
- Thank you.

52:04.511 --> 52:06.017
I wasn't really driving...

52:06.081 --> 52:09.779
I wasn't driving around
looking for anything like that.

52:09.882 --> 52:11.918
No? Well, you found me.

52:13.050 --> 52:15.181
You want to just have lunch with me?

52:15.253 --> 52:18.261
That'd be nice,
but I need to make my money.

53:42.669 --> 53:43.839
What?

53:47.137 --> 53:49.213
Come on, it's time to go.

54:02.282 --> 54:03.455
Here.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.641
Stefano!

56:23.814 --> 56:24.988
Okay.

56:33.091 --> 56:34.535
That's fine.

56:34.991 --> 56:36.335
Let's go.

56:36.527 --> 56:38.303
Open the computer.

57:00.014 --> 57:02.394
- Where did you say you're from?
- Laroux.

57:02.485 --> 57:03.714
Stefano?

57:03.951 --> 57:05.183
Yes, sir?

57:16.464 --> 57:19.172
- Can I get some earplugs, man?
- Yeah.

58:06.741 --> 58:08.419
Come on. Roll it out.

58:36.104 --> 58:38.661
Are you going to be
driving up to the track tonight?

58:38.734 --> 58:43.108
I think I'm going to stay in LA tonight.
I'll go in the morning.

01:01:43.138 --> 01:01:44.369
Daisy!

01:02:20.105 --> 01:02:21.668
No one's there!

01:03:37.509 --> 01:03:38.976
Daisy!

01:05:04.727 --> 01:05:07.732
Hello. I'm in Room 325.

01:05:10.099 --> 01:05:12.476
I might be getting a call soon.

01:05:15.396 --> 01:05:18.804
I just wanted you to know
that if somebody calls...

01:05:20.603 --> 01:05:22.639
to put the call through.

01:05:22.803 --> 01:05:24.675
And she might just come by...

01:05:24.742 --> 01:05:28.659
so if somebody named Daisy
comes to the front desk looking for me...

01:05:28.777 --> 01:05:30.281
I'm Bud Clay.

01:05:31.581 --> 01:05:34.532
You can let her come right up to the room.

01:05:37.088 --> 01:05:38.283
Daisy.

01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:43.798
Okay.

01:05:45.026 --> 01:05:46.496
Bye. Thanks.

01:07:02.763 --> 01:07:04.062
Hi, Bud.

01:07:05.734 --> 01:07:07.410
I got your note.

01:07:10.541 --> 01:07:12.705
I have to use the bathroom.

01:08:00.948 --> 01:08:02.750
Can I hug you, Bud?

01:08:10.431 --> 01:08:12.329
Can I sit on your lap?

01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:17.273
Can I touch you?

01:08:22.803 --> 01:08:25.412
You don't want to touch me anymore?

01:08:27.975 --> 01:08:30.359
Don't you like me anymore, Bud?

01:08:30.946 --> 01:08:32.359
I like you.

01:08:34.817 --> 01:08:36.354
Can I hug you?

01:08:46.694 --> 01:08:50.303
Remember how, after dinner,
when you were done eating...

01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:53.607
you'd always turn sideways in your chair
and pat your thighs...

01:08:53.665 --> 01:08:56.374
and I would come and sit on your lap?

01:08:57.604 --> 01:09:01.546
You would let me sit there for a long time
and we would kiss.

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:04.346
Remember, Bud?

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.889
Please, can I hug you?

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:19.484
Okay.

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.984
Missed you. Missed you so much.

01:09:53.752 --> 01:09:57.730
I'm thirsty. I'm gonna get a glass of water.
You want some?

01:09:59.594 --> 01:10:00.701
No.

01:10:35.293 --> 01:10:37.855
I'm sorry. Don't look at me like that.

01:10:38.295 --> 01:10:40.130
I know I look ugly.

01:10:41.566 --> 01:10:42.942
I'm sorry.

01:10:45.235 --> 01:10:47.226
I know I look terrible.

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:54.147
I didn't have time to fix myself
before I came over.

01:10:54.643 --> 01:10:58.252
I know we haven't seen each other
in such a long time.

01:10:58.711 --> 01:11:00.748
I'm sorry I look so bad.

01:11:05.222 --> 01:11:09.287
I have to use the bathroom again.
I drank a lot of water before I came here.

01:12:12.282 --> 01:12:16.528
I have to take my antibiotics,
but it's for my allergies.

01:12:19.788 --> 01:12:22.669
I'm sorry, but I guess
I'm just a little nervous.

01:12:23.457 --> 01:12:27.069
Should I go to the store
and get us something to drink?

01:12:31.863 --> 01:12:34.816
- Do you remember the last time I saw you?
- Yes.

01:12:37.138 --> 01:12:39.041
I don't drink anymore.

01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:43.538
I don't drink at all anymore.

01:12:43.643 --> 01:12:45.388
That's great, Bud.

01:12:51.919 --> 01:12:54.413
I keep a photo of us in my purse.

01:12:55.355 --> 01:12:59.168
I look at it every single day.
Do you want to see it?

01:13:02.527 --> 01:13:04.508
Remember, my cousin took it...

01:13:04.562 --> 01:13:07.773
in front of our house on Bay Street,
the day we moved in?

01:13:11.003 --> 01:13:14.668
We're kissing in it. You want to see it?

01:13:21.711 --> 01:13:23.577
Isn't it nice, Bud?

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.242
It was a long time ago.

01:13:34.691 --> 01:13:36.967
I used to love kissing you...

01:13:39.359 --> 01:13:41.194
all over your mouth.

01:13:41.695 --> 01:13:43.443
I love the way you taste.

01:13:45.537 --> 01:13:48.485
You're my favorite person
in the whole world, Bud.

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.699
I never want to kiss anybody else.

01:13:54.577 --> 01:13:56.887
- Really, Bud.
-It's not true.

01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:03.143
I did. I loved kissing you.

01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:07.618
I loved your mouth. I loved the way it tasted.

01:14:07.989 --> 01:14:09.550
It's not true.

01:14:10.557 --> 01:14:13.927
- I never want to kiss anybody else.
- That's not true.

01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:15.224
It is.

01:14:15.896 --> 01:14:17.798
You kissed other boys.

01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:23.611
Do you remember the time you bought me
the really big chocolate bunny?

01:14:24.101 --> 01:14:28.167
It was so big. I ate it in like an hour
and got really sick and threw up.

01:14:28.438 --> 01:14:30.305
You kissed me anyway.

01:14:30.807 --> 01:14:31.978
I remember.

01:14:32.073 --> 01:14:34.241
You used to really like me.

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.690
I still like you.

01:14:43.753 --> 01:14:45.587
I wish you liked me again...

01:14:46.923 --> 01:14:48.189
like before.

01:14:49.357 --> 01:14:51.488
When you liked me the most.

01:14:59.268 --> 01:15:01.763
I liked you the most my whole life.

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:06.048
You're the only person I liked.

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:08.933
- Tell me you love me.
- No.

01:15:12.014 --> 01:15:13.880
I missed you so much.

01:15:15.650 --> 01:15:19.228
It hurts me when I don't see you
for such a long time.

01:15:20.954 --> 01:15:23.480
I just want to hug you. Come here.

01:15:25.824 --> 01:15:26.893
No.

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.470
I love you so much.

01:15:36.969 --> 01:15:39.135
I always loved holding you.

01:15:40.638 --> 01:15:42.587
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:15:45.745 --> 01:15:47.306
Kiss me, Bud.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.224
Don't leave.

01:16:21.612 --> 01:16:23.558
I missed you so much.

01:16:27.214 --> 01:16:28.625
I love you.

01:16:29.949 --> 01:16:33.287
Come on, won't you kiss me? Please?

01:17:06.745 --> 01:17:08.216
I missed you.

01:17:31.171 --> 01:17:32.967
I missed you a lot.

01:18:22.721 --> 01:18:24.554
Take off your shirt.

01:18:31.557 --> 01:18:35.409
But it's so bright in here.

01:18:35.795 --> 01:18:37.244
I want to see your body.

01:18:37.299 --> 01:18:40.830
Can we turn off the light? Please?

01:19:08.025 --> 01:19:10.190
Can we go under the covers?

01:22:10.028 --> 01:22:11.828
You only do this to me?

01:22:12.096 --> 01:22:14.591
You only suck my cock, baby?

01:22:18.998 --> 01:22:21.530
You don't do it with anybody else?

01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:25.417
You don't think about doing it
with anybody else?

01:22:29.076 --> 01:22:30.856
You like doing it?

01:22:54.068 --> 01:22:56.446
You won't suck anybody else?

01:22:56.734 --> 01:22:57.931
Never?

01:22:58.272 --> 01:22:59.744
Never again?

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.374
You promise?

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:08.480
You won't fuck anybody else?

01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.050
You promise?

01:23:13.087 --> 01:23:14.284
Never?

01:23:16.389 --> 01:23:18.584
You won't suck anybody elseâ€™s cock?

01:23:18.657 --> 01:23:19.885
Never?

01:23:20.224 --> 01:23:22.353
You won't suck anybody elseâ€™s cock?

01:23:22.425 --> 01:23:23.984
You promise me?

01:23:26.497 --> 01:23:30.505
Why did you suck that guy's cock?
Why did you fuck those guys?

01:23:31.002 --> 01:23:32.450
Why did you do that?

01:23:32.505 --> 01:23:34.907
Tell me, why did you do that?

01:23:37.141 --> 01:23:38.975
Tell me. I saw you.

01:23:44.178 --> 01:23:46.011
I saw you fuck them.

01:23:46.479 --> 01:23:48.475
Did you know I saw you?

01:23:48.582 --> 01:23:49.847
Never?

01:23:52.452 --> 01:23:54.683
- Why did you let me see that?
- No.

01:24:30.786 --> 01:24:34.457
You're a fucking whore. You're a whore.

01:24:44.301 --> 01:24:48.001
You fucked them. You fucking asshole.

01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:52.874
I hate you so much.

01:25:20.834 --> 01:25:22.910
I don't love you anymore.

01:25:25.207 --> 01:25:28.333
-It hurts me so much when you say that.
-It doesn't hurt you.

01:25:28.405 --> 01:25:29.819
Please don't say that.

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:33.041
I should've never let you come over here.
I'm so stupid.

01:25:33.144 --> 01:25:34.250
Why?

01:25:34.881 --> 01:25:36.865
I'm so stupid for telling you to come here.

01:25:36.918 --> 01:25:38.863
- Bud, I love you.
- You don't love anybody.

01:25:38.918 --> 01:25:42.765
- I love you. I want to be with you again.
- I don't want to be with you.

01:25:42.852 --> 01:25:46.258
- Can't we be a couple again?
<i>- I'll</i> never be with you again.

01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:49.829
- Don't say that, Bud.
- I don't trust you anymore.

01:25:51.061 --> 01:25:53.171
I don't love you anymore.

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:57.846
I'm sorry, Bud. I'm sorry that that happened.

01:25:57.938 --> 01:26:01.544
- You're not sorry.
- I never meant to hurt you, Bud.

01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.217
I don't understand why you did that.

01:26:07.712 --> 01:26:11.022
Why you went with those guys,
I don't understand that.

01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:13.650
It was just a party. I was just being friendly.

01:26:13.715 --> 01:26:15.791
Why were you talking to those guys?

01:26:15.852 --> 01:26:18.799
<i>I saw them talk to you.
Why were you talking to them?</i>

01:26:18.852 --> 01:26:21.419
<i>thought they were nice guys, Bud.</i>

01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:25.039
<i>- Nice guys?
- I talk to lots of guys at parties.</i>

01:26:27.064 --> 01:26:30.011
<i>I didn't want anything from them,
I didn't care about them.</i>

01:26:30.064 --> 01:26:31.738
<i>Why did you get high with them?</i>

01:26:31.798 --> 01:26:34.178
<i>They just came into the bathroom
and they...</i>

01:26:34.234 --> 01:26:36.706
<i>started smoking, and I thought it was pot.</i>

01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:38.545
Why did you smoke pot with them?

01:26:38.603 --> 01:26:42.875
I was just going to have a little.
I just wanted to get high, Bud.

01:26:43.075 --> 01:26:46.061
You were pregnant.
You shouldn't even have been drinking.

01:26:46.112 --> 01:26:47.378
I know.

01:26:48.316 --> 01:26:50.595
Why do you take drugs? I don't understand.

01:26:50.653 --> 01:26:52.486
Because I'm an addict, Bud.

01:26:52.587 --> 01:26:55.900
- Why can't you stop taking it?
- I don't want to take them anymore.

01:26:55.955 --> 01:26:59.874
Why can't you stop taking drugs?
Why do you have to drink and take drugs?

01:26:59.927 --> 01:27:01.726
I don't understand.

01:27:02.762 --> 01:27:06.403
<i>You made our baby die. Our baby died.</i>

01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:10.144
<i>I'm so sorry. I didn't want it to die.</i>

01:27:10.233 --> 01:27:13.114
<i>I didn't want any of it to happen, Bud,
but it did.</i>

01:27:13.736 --> 01:27:17.019
- Tell me what happened.
- They just barged in, Bud.

01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:21.816
<i>- There was no lock on the door and--
- Why didn't you tell them to leave?</i>

01:27:21.911 --> 01:27:25.044
<i>They were standing in front of the door
and started smoking...</i>

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:27.885
<i>and I thought I'd just have a little bit
and then leave.</i>

01:27:27.953 --> 01:27:31.264
<i>- And then what happened?
-Then I passed out, Bud.</i>

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.425
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:27:32.488 --> 01:27:34.960
<i>They raped me,
You saw them and you left me there.</i>

01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:37.824
<i>No, I saw them with you. I didn't see...</i>

01:27:37.924 --> 01:27:41.592
<i>I was unconscious, Bud, and you saw me,
and you didn't help me.</i>

01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:44.306
<i>You just left me there.</i>

01:27:44.366 --> 01:27:47.100
<i>But I didn't know what to do,
I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:27:47.169 --> 01:27:50.301
<i>- Why didn't you help me?
- I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:27:50.706 --> 01:27:52.868
You didn't know what to do?

01:27:54.773 --> 01:27:55.847
No.

01:27:55.943 --> 01:27:58.777
<i>Why didn't you help me?
You left me lying there like that?</i>

01:27:58.844 --> 01:27:59.983
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:28:00.045 --> 01:28:03.362
- I would've helped you, Bud.
- I know.

01:28:03.452 --> 01:28:06.400
- I would've helped you.
- I know you would have.

01:28:09.123 --> 01:28:13.868
<i>I walked away, I saw you in there.
I saw you in the bedroom.</i>

01:28:13.991 --> 01:28:15.791
<i>I saw them touching you.</i>

01:28:15.861 --> 01:28:18.872
<i>I saw them put their hands on you
and touch you.</i>

01:28:18.968 --> 01:28:22.332
<i>And you had your clothes on,
they pulled your bra down.</i>

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:24.391
<i>They had your pants down.</i>

01:28:24.502 --> 01:28:27.142
<i>Then I left. I just kept walking.</i>

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:31.181
And I was walking away to go home.

01:28:33.584 --> 01:28:36.017
<i>When I came back,
there was an ambulance there.</i>

01:28:36.083 --> 01:28:38.247
<i>Why was there an ambulance there?</i>

01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:44.066
I was dead.

01:28:44.322 --> 01:28:47.266
What do you mean?
I don't understand. Why was there--

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:49.095
<i>I</i> died, Bud.

01:28:50.423 --> 01:28:53.374
I got sick. I choked.

01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:56.439
And I died.

01:28:57.328 --> 01:28:59.861
- I'm sorry.
- You didn't die.

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:03.665
Don't say you're sorry. You didn't die.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.947
<i>I know you didn't die.</i>

01:29:07.581 --> 01:29:09.745
<i>You'll be okay, you're just sick.</i>

01:29:10.949 --> 01:29:14.190
<i>- I'm not going to be okay, Bud.
- Yes, you are.</i>

01:29:14.379 --> 01:29:18.954
Nobody was there and I got sick,
and I threw up, and I choked, Bud.

01:29:21.049 --> 01:29:22.794
<i>The ambulance came...</i>

01:29:24.389 --> 01:29:26.223
<i>and I was dead, Bud.</i>

01:29:27.927 --> 01:29:29.225
<i>I died.</i>

01:29:38.243 --> 01:29:39.310
No.
