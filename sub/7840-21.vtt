The Simpsons 18x21 (JABF14)
- 24 Minutes -

00:11.904 --> 00:13.681
Previously on 24...

00:13.869 --> 00:15.175
I mean The Simpsons :

00:16.008 --> 00:16.901
Behold...

00:16.902 --> 00:18.321
our new state-of-the-art weapon

00:18.322 --> 00:20.610
in the global war against mis behavior.

00:20.637 --> 00:21.940
CTU...

00:22.214 --> 00:24.317
the Counter Truancy Unit!

00:29.464 --> 00:30.778
I've got something!

00:30.815 --> 00:32.860
Head Hall Monitor
Loves Poneis / Hates Phonies

00:34.354 --> 00:37.491
The sixth-grade security camera
shows three empty desks.

00:37.491 --> 00:38.368
Enhance!

00:39.260 --> 00:40.122
Skinner Stinks

00:40.519 --> 00:42.063
Dehance! Dehance!

00:42.157 --> 00:43.950
Principal / Mama's Boy

00:45.166 --> 00:47.301
I ran the attendance protocols.

00:47.308 --> 00:49.383
Here are your three missing students:

00:49.388 --> 00:50.381
Hmm.

00:50.758 --> 00:52.530
Good work, Database.

00:52.535 --> 00:53.713
We helped.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.208 --> 01:14.760
Whoa.

01:14.765 --> 01:16.231
This is the source
of the stench.

01:16.237 --> 01:16.912
Hey.

01:16.918 --> 01:18.280
Get your own yogurt.

01:18.577 --> 01:21.061
ATM User
Devoted Father of Two

01:21.467 --> 01:22.703
Vile curd.

01:23.418 --> 01:25.831
Simpson, you can take your putrid mess

01:25.838 --> 01:26.993
far out of my sight,

01:26.998 --> 01:28.831
you song-less land whale.

01:29.647 --> 01:30.210
Whoo-hoo!

01:30.217 --> 01:31.383
Business trip!

01:39.647 --> 01:40.381
Simpson!

01:40.385 --> 01:42.833
I'll teach you to make a Poupon "me."

02:08.208 --> 02:10.229
If someone did eat Bart's shorts,

02:10.237 --> 02:13.212
they'd have a tummy full of pocket garbage.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.510
Springfield elementary
bake sale
friday 3 p.m,

02:22.738 --> 02:25.200
The school's havinga bake sale today?!

02:25.207 --> 02:26.620
At 3:00?!

02:26.625 --> 02:28.542
- Unemployed.
- I promised them a cake.

02:29.945 --> 02:31.883
I've only got 27 minutes.

02:31.897 --> 02:33.852
The pre-heat is on.

02:43.837 --> 02:46.900
The following takes place
between 2:34 p.m.

02:46.907 --> 02:48.401
and 3:04 p.m.

02:48.546 --> 02:50.213
Or maybe it's a.m.

02:50.216 --> 02:51.972
Whichever one is the morning one,

02:51.975 --> 02:53.251
it's not that one.

02:58.956 --> 03:00.922
Apu, I'm returning a yogurt

03:00.928 --> 03:03.290
I wasn't a hundred percent satisfied with.

03:03.948 --> 03:04.740
Mmm?

03:05.715 --> 03:07.113
Ooh. Oh my God!

03:07.118 --> 03:09.792
If a dead fish and a homeless
person had a baby,

03:09.796 --> 03:12.460
and the baby puked,
and a dog ate the puke,

03:12.467 --> 03:14.561
this smells like the rear end
of that dog!

03:14.567 --> 03:16.090
I'll give you any
yogurt in the store,

03:16.096 --> 03:18.442
just take that thing
with you when you go!

03:22.906 --> 03:24.800
Let's spit in the coffee pots.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.183
I call hazelnut.

03:26.188 --> 03:28.460
Truants moving into the Kwik-E-Mart.

03:28.918 --> 03:30.370
I've got a visual.

03:34.056 --> 03:35.000
Ugh!

03:35.006 --> 03:37.210
That yogurt is toxic.

03:37.216 --> 03:39.513
It's just what
we've been looking for.

03:44.927 --> 03:48.563
Now this crossword's nothin' but swears.

03:49.336 --> 03:50.492
We've got what we need.

03:50.495 --> 03:51.651
Milhouse, bring them in.

03:51.656 --> 03:52.771
Roger that.

03:54.497 --> 03:56.860
And Lisa, if I don't make it back,

03:56.865 --> 03:59.281
there's a letter in my locker
I want you to read.

03:59.288 --> 04:00.370
I already read it.

04:00.376 --> 04:01.880
We've all read it.

04:02.228 --> 04:04.470
Wait, Milhouse,
hold your position.

04:04.475 --> 04:05.901
Something doesn't add up.

04:05.906 --> 04:08.222
Look what the bullies
could have stolen...

04:08.225 --> 04:11.231
Big Chief Rotten Cheeks
Chewing Tobacco...

04:11.278 --> 04:14.053
a take-a-penny tray
with a quarter in it.

04:14.056 --> 04:16.440
So why steal the yogurt?

04:16.454 --> 04:18.440
We have to find out
what they're up to.

04:18.447 --> 04:19.122
Hmm...

04:19.125 --> 04:20.713
Milhouse, change of plan

04:20.714 --> 04:22.690
observe and follow.

04:22.698 --> 04:24.751
Permission to buy
a Hostess fruit pie

04:24.755 --> 04:26.133
to keep my strength up?

04:26.136 --> 04:27.022
Denied.

04:32.298 --> 04:33.982
Hey Milhouse, who are
you spying on?

04:33.986 --> 04:35.113
Those bullies?

04:36.328 --> 04:37.372
Huh?

04:41.175 --> 04:42.653
What about the fat guy?

04:42.655 --> 04:43.740
Hey, lay off.

04:43.747 --> 04:45.362
You're the fat one
of you guys!

04:45.365 --> 04:47.351
I'm bulking up
for football!

04:49.866 --> 04:51.020
I'm still alive.

04:51.027 --> 04:52.732
You call that playing to win?

05:02.546 --> 05:04.790
Mr. Simpson, I'm scared.

05:04.796 --> 05:06.601
This is our life now, Milhouse.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.122
We're Dumpster folk.

05:09.527 --> 05:10.871
I've lost Milhouse.

05:10.886 --> 05:12.513
He'll be somewhat missed.

05:14.946 --> 05:16.291
Who do we send now?

05:19.136 --> 05:20.343
Principal Skinner,

05:20.346 --> 05:22.292
you know we have only one agent

05:22.295 --> 05:24.851
who stands a chance
with those bullies.

05:24.856 --> 05:26.131
My brother.

05:30.157 --> 05:31.820
Lord, give me guidance.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.262
That's right, the Guidance
Department

05:34.266 --> 05:34.962
Detention Room.

05:34.966 --> 05:36.082
Thank you, Mrs. Lord.

05:49.735 --> 05:50.311
Hmm?

05:50.538 --> 05:52.082
All out?

05:52.195 --> 05:55.433
I can't make my famous raisin
sponge-cake without raisins.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.931
Kids love the zing of raisins!

06:05.615 --> 06:07.922
If I help you, I want full
immunity for

06:07.928 --> 06:09.991
all pranks past and future,

06:09.998 --> 06:12.161
and you have to teach
me a swear word

06:12.165 --> 06:13.933
I don't already know.

06:13.975 --> 06:15.430
No deal.

06:15.435 --> 06:16.952
Okay, suit yourself.

06:16.956 --> 06:19.641
It's not like you have any
major events coming up

06:19.647 --> 06:21.950
that the bullies would
want to disrupt.

06:22.315 --> 06:23.971
The bake sale!

06:23.976 --> 06:26.033
Principal Skinner,
as we both know,

06:26.036 --> 06:27.690
but you might need reminding,

06:27.705 --> 06:30.220
the annual bake sale provides
90%

06:30.226 --> 06:31.971
of the school's funding.

06:32.356 --> 06:34.381
Okay, you have a deal,

06:34.455 --> 06:35.930
you conniving little...

06:37.828 --> 06:39.721
Wow, that's a swear?

06:39.728 --> 06:41.021
Used as a noun it is.

06:41.036 --> 06:42.323
Sweet!

06:42.325 --> 06:43.630
Now I'm going to need
some wheels.

06:43.635 --> 06:44.341
Yes, of course.

06:44.345 --> 06:46.272
I think we can wrangle you
a used bicycle.

06:46.277 --> 06:47.601
Do you prefer Schwinn or Huffy?

06:47.845 --> 06:49.393
Bart? Where did he...?

06:50.048 --> 06:51.373
My car keys!

06:53.788 --> 06:57.140
Road kill, burnt hair,
my sister's retainer case,

06:57.146 --> 07:00.172
six weeks of bottled farts,
possum placenta,

07:00.177 --> 07:02.370
sweat from a walk-around Goofy suit.

07:02.377 --> 07:05.471
And finally, T.C.B.Y.

07:05.488 --> 07:08.570
that container of botulized yogurt.

07:08.575 --> 07:10.933
Okay, everyone, masks on.

07:19.998 --> 07:24.530
Gentlemen, we've created
the mother of all stink bombs.

07:26.058 --> 07:28.200
Most satisfactory.

07:28.884 --> 07:31.092
Jimbo, sweetie, I have
to run to the bank.

07:31.101 --> 07:32.730
Are you boys going
to be okay alone?

07:32.730 --> 07:34.252
Put a top on, Mom!

07:34.269 --> 07:36.052
Everyone's seen your implants.

07:36.057 --> 07:37.630
But the doctor said the air will help them...

07:37.647 --> 07:39.333
Just go!

07:39.746 --> 07:41.652
Lookin' good, Carol!

08:05.408 --> 08:06.460
I saw it first!

08:06.468 --> 08:08.203
You are such a liar!

08:10.985 --> 08:12.781
You give that to me!

08:37.375 --> 08:39.432
Must... escape.

08:44.356 --> 08:46.470
Springfield Elementary is about

08:46.477 --> 08:49.153
to be Stinkfield Elementary.

08:54.186 --> 08:56.331
Lisa, they're going to put a
stink bomb in the school.

08:56.338 --> 08:57.611
I might be able to stop them,

08:57.616 --> 08:59.742
but I'll need a schematic of Jimbo's house.

09:00.325 --> 09:03.651
Jimbo drew a couple of pictures
of his house in second grade,

09:03.658 --> 09:05.422
but I can't vouch for their accuracy.

09:05.425 --> 09:07.253
The teacher gave him a frowny-face.

09:12.096 --> 09:14.271
I'm so proud of us.

09:17.116 --> 09:18.232
You got Jimbo.

09:18.265 --> 09:19.573
They're on to you, Jimbo!

09:19.586 --> 09:20.413
Get out of there!

09:20.416 --> 09:22.611
Scram... boiled eggs would be lovely

09:22.615 --> 09:24.003
for breakfast, Mother.

09:24.006 --> 09:25.953
Just go! Quickly!

09:25.955 --> 09:27.061
We're busted!

09:27.067 --> 09:28.031
Thanks, mole.

09:28.038 --> 09:29.852
Now make your split-screen vanish.

09:29.858 --> 09:30.803
Will do!

09:30.806 --> 09:31.322
Ooh!

09:38.537 --> 09:40.562
Damn it, these blue prints are all wrong.

09:40.567 --> 09:43.311
Where's the roller coaster room
and the shark tank?

09:44.428 --> 09:44.901
Ooh.

09:53.147 --> 09:54.032
Huh?

10:00.447 --> 10:02.643
Son of a beach ball, they're gone!

10:06.748 --> 10:07.891
I've got a man down!

10:08.148 --> 10:09.230
Well, not a man.

10:09.307 --> 10:10.711
A very special boy.

10:11.896 --> 10:13.590
Chloe, I need those schematics now!

10:13.595 --> 10:14.901
What? Who is this?

10:14.905 --> 10:15.820
I'm Jack Bauer.

10:15.827 --> 10:16.951
Who the hell are you?

10:16.956 --> 10:19.223
Me? Uh, I'm...

10:19.227 --> 10:20.342
Ahmed Adoody.

10:20.347 --> 10:23.183
Chloe, find out all you can about Ahmed Adoody.

10:23.278 --> 10:25.410
Does anyone there know Ahmed Adoody?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.611
Ahmed Adoody, wealthy Saudi financier.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.831
Disappeared into Afghanistan in the late 90s.

10:29.837 --> 10:30.342
Really?

10:30.347 --> 10:31.811
No, Jack, it's a joke name.

10:31.815 --> 10:32.792
You're being set up.

10:32.795 --> 10:33.480
Damn it!

10:39.945 --> 10:40.790
Now, let's see.

10:40.795 --> 10:43.970
20 minutes at 300 degrees is
the equivalent of

10:43.978 --> 10:45.262
five minutes at...

10:45.266 --> 10:46.523
Let's see...

10:46.526 --> 10:47.831
1,200 degrees.

10:49.627 --> 10:50.103
Now...

10:50.105 --> 10:51.940
to make the folded index card

10:51.945 --> 10:53.742
that goes in front of the cake.

11:06.427 --> 11:07.601
D'oh!

11:08.908 --> 11:10.163
No!

11:11.235 --> 11:15.242
Oh. Pink frosting fixes everything.

11:18.555 --> 11:21.503
Say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating?

11:21.506 --> 11:22.541
Oh, mine is.

11:22.545 --> 11:24.833
Still, I wouldn't describe it as unpleasant.

11:24.836 --> 11:26.601
Well, let's get some shut-eye.

11:28.817 --> 11:30.851
Ooh, it's that bar I like!

11:30.858 --> 11:32.081
Wait here in the car.

11:32.086 --> 11:33.191
Ow!

11:36.557 --> 11:38.823
Okay, this might hurt a little.

11:38.827 --> 11:39.883
No problem.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.263
Oh, sweet mother of Mary!

11:48.087 --> 11:49.991
Okay, Milhouse, what do you want to do?

11:49.995 --> 11:52.170
Well, the school's havinga bake sale.

11:52.176 --> 11:54.580
Old Betsy'll get us there.

11:59.827 --> 12:02.471
We are projecting aneffective stink radius

12:02.507 --> 12:05.011
farther than any of uscan kick a kickball.

12:05.018 --> 12:08.102
Sir, we have to call off this bake sale now!

12:08.107 --> 12:10.382
Yes, yes, yes,we have to do something.

12:10.387 --> 12:11.783
Although,

12:11.787 --> 12:14.970
the basketball hoops have been retracted.

12:14.976 --> 12:17.602
D.J. Fun-times has already cashed his deposit,

12:17.606 --> 12:19.522
and Superintendent Chalmers won't be happy to hear...

12:19.528 --> 12:21.481
I won't be happy tohear what, Seymour?

12:21.496 --> 12:24.103
Um, that, uh, bake sale revenue projections

12:24.108 --> 12:25.401
are through the roof!

12:25.407 --> 12:27.581
I'm very happy to hear that.

12:27.586 --> 12:29.210
You don't know me at all.

12:30.277 --> 12:33.241
We have to find those bullies before the bake sale starts.

12:33.245 --> 12:36.660
Martin, run a top-down search on the school security grid.

12:36.665 --> 12:39.652
Will do, and you chose the perfect person.

12:47.198 --> 12:48.493
The stink bomb!

12:48.497 --> 12:50.460
I can't let anyone see it!

12:50.466 --> 12:51.771
Martin, anything?

12:51.888 --> 12:52.850
I wish.

12:52.856 --> 12:55.832
This is as boring as mainstream cinema.

12:57.217 --> 12:58.400
So true.

13:16.727 --> 13:18.592
Cops. Act natural.

13:21.187 --> 13:23.272
Hello, Officer!

13:23.277 --> 13:24.823
Oh, afternoon, ma'am.

13:25.385 --> 13:27.910
What is it about a woman in a Dumpster?

13:42.937 --> 13:43.903
Wait!

13:45.248 --> 13:47.083
Mr. Simpson!

13:54.098 --> 13:55.653
My cake!

14:11.845 --> 14:15.602
They're gonna wish the bake sale was a nose plug sale.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.850
And it totally isn't.

14:20.695 --> 14:21.600
Teens?

14:21.608 --> 14:23.220
In Willie's hidey hole?

14:23.228 --> 14:26.342
I'll mop up your blood from the inside!

14:35.307 --> 14:37.680
We have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!

14:37.698 --> 14:38.732
I'll check it out.

14:45.656 --> 14:47.931
<i>Skip, skip, skip to my Lou...</i>

14:47.938 --> 14:49.200
Top of the morning, Nelson.

14:49.205 --> 14:50.373
And to you, Martin.

14:50.375 --> 14:52.743
<i>Skip to my Lou, my darling.</i>

14:52.858 --> 14:54.630
Hey, Nelson, what gives?

14:54.637 --> 14:57.231
Martin just skipped past you singing "Skip to my Lou",

14:57.238 --> 14:59.081
and you did nothing.

14:59.087 --> 15:01.412
Can't a guy enjoy a catchy tune?

15:03.935 --> 15:05.151
Ow! Ow!

15:05.168 --> 15:07.410
I'm unclear on what you want!

15:09.845 --> 15:11.433
Is Martin working for Jimbo?

15:12.068 --> 15:12.862
Uh...

15:14.286 --> 15:15.180
Ow!

15:16.098 --> 15:17.273
Yes.

15:17.278 --> 15:18.362
Yes what?

15:18.737 --> 15:19.541
Ow!

15:20.566 --> 15:21.653
Yes, sir.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.362
Lisa, are you on a secure line?

15:25.367 --> 15:26.163
I am.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.561
You're on a Bluetooth cell phone,

15:27.565 --> 15:29.843
the most vulnerable device known to man.

15:29.855 --> 15:31.323
But it looks so cool.

15:31.325 --> 15:33.120
Listen, there's a mole inside CTU.

15:33.127 --> 15:34.142
A mole?!

15:34.145 --> 15:35.140
Yes, a mole.

15:35.148 --> 15:36.271
Now, I don't have much time,

15:36.276 --> 15:38.272
so I'm just gonna come right out and say his name,

15:38.278 --> 15:39.530
so get ready to know his name.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.311
His name is the following: M...

15:44.808 --> 15:46.180
<i>Skip, skip,</i>

15:46.188 --> 15:47.840
<i>skip to my Lou.</i>

15:51.468 --> 15:53.063
Rice Krispie Treats?!

15:53.076 --> 15:55.353
Way to phone it in, Sarah Wiggum.

15:55.356 --> 15:57.553
Excuse me, excuse me, I'm in the sale.

15:57.568 --> 15:58.922
I'm in the sale.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.812
Okay, I kept my end of the deal.

16:02.817 --> 16:04.842
Release my friends.

16:07.865 --> 16:10.782
All here, from Asimov to Zarathustra.

16:11.718 --> 16:12.993
Where's Phobos?!

16:12.998 --> 16:14.711
He's with us now.

16:17.195 --> 16:18.217
We're out of here.

16:18.217 --> 16:19.372
Smell you later.

16:19.376 --> 16:22.081
Three minutes later, to be exact.

16:25.658 --> 16:27.870
What have I done?

16:51.988 --> 16:53.052
Raisin cake.

16:53.057 --> 16:54.630
Who wants raisin cake?

16:54.636 --> 16:56.931
Don't worry, it's not too moist.

16:57.525 --> 16:58.060
Hmm?

17:02.287 --> 17:03.733
Can I have some more money?

17:03.738 --> 17:05.520
I gave you ten dollars.

17:05.605 --> 17:08.002
All the other moms gave their husbands twenty.

17:08.007 --> 17:09.542
Well, all the other husbands

17:09.548 --> 17:11.613
don't come home dirty from fighting.

17:11.617 --> 17:12.423
I had to fight.

17:12.428 --> 17:14.461
Lenny said his dad is Hulk Hogan,

17:14.467 --> 17:16.071
and I know he's not.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.291
Here's five more dollars.

17:21.065 --> 17:22.621
Bart, are you all right?

17:22.645 --> 17:23.450
Bart?!

17:23.458 --> 17:24.853
Hey, I'm fine.
They haven't made

17:24.856 --> 17:26.271
a French horn yet that can hurt me.

17:26.275 --> 17:28.349
Now, I'm sending you a picture of the bomb.

17:32.276 --> 17:33.433
My God.

17:33.436 --> 17:36.011
That's a class-fives tench-dispersal unit.

17:36.016 --> 17:37.980
We have to shortout that fan.

17:42.497 --> 17:44.212
"H.D.W."
What's that?

17:44.218 --> 17:46.563
That's the main valve of the hot dog water

17:46.566 --> 17:48.180
recirculation system.

17:48.188 --> 17:51.721
There's over 30 years of wiener soakings in there.

17:51.725 --> 17:53.500
Lis, you have to release that water.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.310
It's the only wayto short out the fan.

17:55.318 --> 17:57.123
But you and Willie will drown.

17:57.128 --> 17:58.432
Possibly, but I can't risk

17:58.438 --> 17:59.971
Superintendent Chalmers finding out about...

18:00.018 --> 18:01.341
Finding out about what, Seymour?

18:01.675 --> 18:04.260
Um, about how early press coverage of

18:04.265 --> 18:06.132
the bake sale is uniformly positive.

18:06.137 --> 18:09.482
Once again, you have thoroughly misgauged my response.

18:09.486 --> 18:11.923
This is going on your permanent record.

18:20.796 --> 18:23.442
The hot dog water's going to push us into the fan!

18:25.105 --> 18:27.491
And I just sharpened those blades.

18:46.947 --> 18:52.100
<i>Skip to my Lou...my darling.</i>

18:53.108 --> 18:54.843
Bart, I've got an idea.

18:54.848 --> 18:55.900
As you're dying,

18:55.908 --> 18:58.153
jam the blades with your spine.

18:58.156 --> 19:00.022
Keep pitching. I'll be back.

19:10.337 --> 19:11.421
Look!

19:11.425 --> 19:14.732
A window to a child's watery grave!

19:14.737 --> 19:16.630
Don't worry, I'll free the boy.

19:22.846 --> 19:24.461
Damn it! This glass is bulletproof.

19:24.465 --> 19:26.052
There's nothing that can shatter it.

19:26.058 --> 19:28.510
Yes, there is!

19:37.726 --> 19:38.500
Huh?

19:40.145 --> 19:41.210
Ooh, a thermos.

19:41.217 --> 19:43.382
With seven cups of coffee still in it.

19:43.385 --> 19:44.312
Oh, wait, six.

19:44.318 --> 19:45.983
Dad, that's a bomb!

19:45.985 --> 19:47.560
Here! It's yours!

19:50.328 --> 19:51.872
How do I stop it?

19:52.818 --> 19:54.473
Oh, that's convenient.

19:56.697 --> 19:59.220
Thank goodness this crisis was averted.

19:59.235 --> 20:00.490
Nicely done, Lisa.

20:00.495 --> 20:02.111
Hey, what about me?

20:02.116 --> 20:04.161
I almost died, and so did Willie.

20:05.565 --> 20:06.811
Oh, leave me be.

20:06.815 --> 20:10.273
I don't want to live if I have to clean up this mess.

20:17.668 --> 20:19.950
Oh, my special little guy.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.232
I'm so glad you're okay.

20:23.027 --> 20:26.103
Oh, I'm just glad you taste like hot dogs.

20:32.767 --> 20:33.983
Good work, Lisa!

20:33.988 --> 20:35.181
What about me?

20:35.186 --> 20:36.651
Bart Simpson, 12 minutes ago,

20:36.655 --> 20:38.693
you made an annoying prank phone call to me.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.142
All units, move in.

20:48.378 --> 20:50.923
I pulled every single field agent off all other cases

20:50.925 --> 20:52.893
to track you down and bring you to justice.

20:52.896 --> 20:54.340
It was a tough decision,

20:54.348 --> 20:56.193
but I think I made the right call.

21:00.535 --> 21:02.433
It's okay, that was Shelbyville.
