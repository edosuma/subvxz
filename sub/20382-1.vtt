01:40.140 --> 01:44.660
'' Hurricane Lucy ripped across
Puerto Rico last October 1 2...

01:44.740 --> 01:49.460
causing even greater devastation
than Hurricane George two years ago.

01:49.540 --> 01:53.020
This time the damage
was considerable.

01:53.060 --> 01:55.420
This time the damage...

01:55.460 --> 01:58.780
was estimated
at $1 .8 billion.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.260
This time--

02:01.260 --> 02:03.180
This time the damage--

02:06.180 --> 02:08.860
This time the damage is est--''

02:13.780 --> 02:15.340
Jesus.

02:18.980 --> 02:20.620
Chantal?

03:29.540 --> 03:31.420
Shouldn’t you get that?

03:47.860 --> 03:49.900
- Hello?
- Henry?

03:49.980 --> 03:53.340
Victor Benezet here.
How are you?

03:53.420 --> 03:55.620
As well as can be expected
under the circumstances.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.060
That's good.

03:57.140 --> 04:00.940
I'm sorry to call you like this,
but I need you to come in.

04:01.020 --> 04:04.260
- There's a charity ball tonight.
- It's just a few questions.

04:04.340 --> 04:06.980
l understand why
you were distressed yesterday...

04:07.060 --> 04:09.380
but we do need
to make a proper report.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.300
I'm giving the toast tonight.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.140
And I'm looking forward
to it, old boy.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.540
Can't we do this tomorrow, Victor?
it’s a fund-raiser.

04:15.620 --> 04:18.899
This'll only take ten minutes.
See you at the station, then.

05:49.740 --> 05:52.260
- Arias.
- Yes?

06:45.140 --> 06:47.220
Hey, how you doing?

07:13.580 --> 07:15.940
Tell me your speech
won't be in sufferably long.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.980
They won't serve dinner
until you're finished.

07:19.060 --> 07:22.940
If you're hungry, write a check,
because I can crawl all night.

07:23.020 --> 07:25.820
Don't bait Henry.
He's nervous.

07:25.860 --> 07:28.580
Henry loves being the center
of attention, don't you?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.540
- Excuse us, will you?
- Yes, go ahead.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.900
I have a position
for a good handyman...

08:31.980 --> 08:35.220
in case you ever tire
of these long policeman's hours.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.659
Nothing works around here.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.780
I do appreciate your coming in
on such short notice, Henry.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.220
You look marvelous.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.340
Just grand.

08:49.260 --> 08:52.380
- You get younger every day.
- Thank you, Victor.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.580
You met Detective Owens
yesterday at the house.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.140
Happy San Sebastian to you.

08:59.220 --> 09:01.540
Same to you, Mr. Hearst.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.580
I'll burn us some coffee.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.460
Nonfat milk if you have it.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.860
I don't think he heard me, actually.
He reminds me a lot of you.

09:14.940 --> 09:17.140
Only listens when it suits him.

09:17.860 --> 09:20.060
That's unfair, Henry.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.340
Not only am I a good listener...

09:22.380 --> 09:24.140
but I keep it all in here.

09:24.220 --> 09:26.500
Anyway, we should have this
cleared up in no time.

09:26.540 --> 09:29.220
Perhaps under the circumstances,
I should be calling you ''Captain.''

09:29.300 --> 09:32.140
Oh, no.
No need for that formality.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.260
I do apologize about the timing.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.260
I know you're due
across the street.

09:37.340 --> 09:40.620
We just need to clarify some
of the details from your report.

09:40.700 --> 09:44.260
Your superintendent is one
of the charity's biggest supporters.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.540
I know, I know.

09:45.620 --> 09:48.740
So if you'll help us put an end
to some of these nagging questions--

09:48.820 --> 09:50.860
why, we'll have you
on your way.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.860
I would've thought you'd be
at the party already.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.820
You do know how to have fun,
don’t you, Victor?

09:55.900 --> 09:58.300
Tuxedo's all ready to go.

09:58.340 --> 10:02.060
I must say, Henry,
you seem in high spirits...

10:02.140 --> 10:04.580
what with all this
on your doorstep.

10:04.660 --> 10:07.180
How should I behave?

10:22.260 --> 10:23.820
How's Chantal?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.700
Waiting.

10:25.740 --> 10:28.180
A noble quality
in that young woman.

10:29.220 --> 10:32.180
Something mine didn't seem
to want to do.

10:32.260 --> 10:36.140
I was sad to hear that. We always
thought you made a charming couple.

10:36.220 --> 10:38.140
Charming, perhaps...

10:38.180 --> 10:40.340
but dull, apparently.

10:42.220 --> 10:44.140
You see the children much?

10:45.860 --> 10:47.980
Both of my daughters
are living with their mother...

10:48.060 --> 10:49.700
back in New York City.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.420
Must be hard
during the holidays and all.

10:55.940 --> 10:57.860
We should get on with it.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.940
- No milk?
- I'm sorry.

11:16.580 --> 11:18.500
No, thanks.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.020
You're into charity.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.940
Why don't you fund-raise us
up a cappuccino machine...

11:23.020 --> 11:26.540
so all the lowlifes that come through
here can enjoy a solid cup of coffee?

11:26.620 --> 11:29.340
I was just going to ask
Mr. Hearst about the dog.

11:29.380 --> 11:32.460
Oh, yeah. Right.
The ''mystery dog.''

11:32.540 --> 11:35.780
Actually, I like ''ghost dog.''
That's got a nice ring to it.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.580
Can we start again?

11:37.660 --> 11:39.580
I come in here
like you ask...

11:39.620 --> 11:42.940
and Mr. Congeniality here is
taking a hostile manner with me.

11:46.980 --> 11:49.100
It's this case, Henry.

11:49.180 --> 11:51.100
It has everyone on edge.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.100
But it’s just--

11:54.180 --> 11:56.900
This business is strange...

11:56.980 --> 11:59.540
going by what's in the record.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.940
But let's see.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.620
Here. January 6.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.820
Yesterday afternoon.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.060
You say you were...

12:09.100 --> 12:10.900
out jogging with a dog.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.540
Yes. Man's best friend.

12:13.620 --> 12:15.860
Belonging to a neighbor of yours...

12:15.940 --> 12:18.100
named Ricardi.

12:18.180 --> 12:19.100
You ever own one?

12:19.180 --> 12:22.260
When I was a boy,
my family had Great Danes.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.780
But you don't own one now?

12:24.860 --> 12:27.140
Chantal prefers cats.

12:27.220 --> 12:31.220
- So, do you have a cat?
- Too unsanitary.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.020
Chantal would want a cat,
but only if it could be sanitized.

12:34.060 --> 12:37.500
What do you mean?
Cats are always licking themselves.

12:37.580 --> 12:39.940
I dumped a girlfriend once
because of her damn cat.

12:39.980 --> 12:42.140
Thing had me up all night
slurping away.

12:42.180 --> 12:44.500
A dog is a lot more unsanitary...

12:44.580 --> 12:47.420
but at least when
they're sleeping, they sleep.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.460
Thank you for that.

12:51.540 --> 12:54.540
Anyway, the messiest is a canary.

12:54.620 --> 12:56.500
She refused that too.

12:56.580 --> 12:59.220
But for once I stuck to my guns.

13:00.460 --> 13:02.660
I can be quite firm
if I need to be.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.460
What was his name again?

13:04.540 --> 13:06.500
Tango.

13:07.460 --> 13:10.700
Do you write that
just like ''tango''?

13:10.780 --> 13:14.380
How else would you write it,
like ''waltz'' or ''fox-trot''?

13:14.460 --> 13:16.820
When you were questioned...

13:16.900 --> 13:19.460
you said...

13:19.540 --> 13:21.780
''I discovered the girl.''

13:23.220 --> 13:26.020
What we're not clear about here
is what the dog was doing.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.740
So?

13:28.780 --> 13:32.300
Logically, you would expect that
the dog would have found the girl.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.820
Well, I suppose it did.

13:33.900 --> 13:37.580
But you say you found her.

13:37.660 --> 13:40.660
Well, me, the dog--
We were together.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.420
We found the body.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.620
What difference does it make?
I called the police.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.900
Unless, perhaps, you think the dog
called and disguised his voice.

13:55.460 --> 13:56.740
Mr. Hearst...

13:58.460 --> 14:00.380
two young girls
have been found strangled...

14:00.420 --> 14:02.660
within the past 16 days.

14:04.100 --> 14:07.100
It is my job
to find the murderer.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.380
You're a principal witness
to the crime scene.

14:10.460 --> 14:13.500
Now, I have to make sure
that the facts of your statements...

14:13.540 --> 14:16.780
agree with the other facts
of the case.

14:16.860 --> 14:19.020
Mr. Hearst doesn't appear
to be as distressed today.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.140
I'm a guest here. I'll be
treated with respect, Sergeant Opie.

14:23.220 --> 14:24.540
Owens.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.540
- That's Detective Owens.
- Please.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.780
- O-W--
- Please!

14:31.740 --> 14:34.180
Let's all--
Let's all relax.

14:35.220 --> 14:37.700
Everyone has somewhere else
they'd like to be.

14:38.780 --> 14:41.620
Now, Henry, if you don't mind...

14:41.700 --> 14:42.900
please...

14:44.100 --> 14:47.860
tell us one more time
how you came upon the girl.

14:50.340 --> 14:53.060
I jogged up to Ricardi's
like I always do.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.660
I grabbed the dog.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.460
Better run him
a little faster, Henry.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.500
He's getting a belly
as round as yours!

15:02.580 --> 15:04.260
Fuckin' old geezer.

15:04.340 --> 15:06.100
Come on, boy.
Let's go. Let's go!

15:07.860 --> 15:09.060
This dog--

15:09.860 --> 15:11.780
He was definitely with you?

15:12.740 --> 15:14.660
What dialect do you need this in?

15:14.740 --> 15:17.060
Yes, the dog was with me.

15:17.140 --> 15:20.940
The dog was with me.
Got it?

15:21.020 --> 15:22.980
You're saying Tango--
He was there.

15:23.060 --> 15:24.980
Good. You're catching on.

15:33.820 --> 15:35.740
Tango's all right.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.900
Keeps me company
on my runs.

15:42.940 --> 15:45.620
We took the path
by my house like always.

15:49.380 --> 15:52.180
- Suddenly Tango wasn't there.
- Tango, come on, boy!

15:52.260 --> 15:56.340
I called to him,
but he wouldn't come.

15:56.420 --> 15:59.100
I could hear him.
He was growling, barking...

15:59.140 --> 16:00.700
acting peculiar.

16:02.100 --> 16:04.340
That's when I turned back.
I kept calling.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.780
Tango, come on, boy.

16:07.820 --> 16:09.820
The dog wouldn't come.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.780
You couldn't see the girl
at this point?

16:11.860 --> 16:14.780
Obviously not from the path.

16:14.860 --> 16:17.540
But I could see Tango
in there moving around.

16:17.620 --> 16:20.260
So you ventured off
into the grove.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.140
That's when I saw her.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.420
At first I thought
she was asleep.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.300
She was almost--
I want to say--

16:36.820 --> 16:37.940
angelic.

16:39.140 --> 16:40.900
The way she just lay there.

16:41.700 --> 16:45.020
Her eyes--
They were dark brown.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.420
They were still open.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.500
Sue Ellen Huddy.

16:51.580 --> 16:53.940
She was three days shy
of her 13th birthday.

16:55.540 --> 16:59.300
- How did you discern she was dead?
- I touched her.

16:59.340 --> 17:02.660
I mean, I put my head
on her chest.

17:11.099 --> 17:13.619
There was no heartbeat.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.940
That was that.

17:25.380 --> 17:28.460
- The dog found the body.
- That's correct.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.380
Mr. Ricardi states firmly that
you did not run the dog yesterday.

17:33.380 --> 17:37.580
He admits that on most days you do,
but not yesterday.

17:38.420 --> 17:40.260
Well, he just
doesn't remember right.

17:40.340 --> 17:43.620
Well, that may be, but in that case,
your neighbor...

17:43.660 --> 17:47.300
Miss Lazzo,
doesn't remember either.

17:47.340 --> 17:50.540
And another neighbor, Mr. Irwin,
also suffers memory loss.

17:50.620 --> 17:53.100
In the whole area, you're the only one
who remembers correctly.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.940
- Who am I to believe?
- Them, naturally.

17:56.020 --> 18:00.940
Come on. You're taking this personally.
I'm just trying to find the truth.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.580
You know, you enjoy hounding me.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.500
- How is that, Henry?
- You forget I know all your tricks.

18:06.540 --> 18:09.500
A murder by some thug or nutcase--
That's average.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.980
But when it's a pillar
of the legal community...

18:12.060 --> 18:13.940
that's more than
just a witness--

18:14.020 --> 18:16.900
Then it's banner headlines,
television.

18:16.980 --> 18:20.340
It'd help in your push to become
our next police superintendent, right?

18:20.420 --> 18:22.540
Come on, Victor.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.300
Confess.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.740
See? I got you.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.460
Let's say you're right.

18:34.540 --> 18:36.220
Everything you say.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.500
I bag a prominent attorney...

18:38.540 --> 18:42.460
hang his pelt on the trophy wall
of my new luxurious offices.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.460
What about your neighbors, then?

18:46.500 --> 18:48.580
Are you saying that
they're all out to get you too?

18:48.660 --> 18:51.020
- How would I know?
- Why would they be?

18:52.540 --> 18:55.140
Maybe because I'm very rich?

18:55.220 --> 18:57.140
Because I have a big house...

18:57.220 --> 18:59.540
and a glamorous wife.

18:59.620 --> 19:03.100
I have these things,
and it happens I don't deserve them.

19:03.780 --> 19:06.900
My looks are entirely ordinary,
and I'm no genius.

19:08.260 --> 19:11.100
Mediocre people
tolerate success...

19:11.140 --> 19:14.860
when it comes to someone exceptional
like a movie star or an athlete...

19:14.940 --> 19:17.900
but when it comes
to one of their own...

19:17.980 --> 19:20.660
then it strikes them
as being an injustice.

19:22.020 --> 19:23.180
You agree?

19:26.060 --> 19:29.300
I think we're getting
a little far a field.

19:30.460 --> 19:34.060
Interesting thing is, there were no
dog prints found at the murder scene...

19:34.140 --> 19:37.140
and we know that
without the dog...

19:37.220 --> 19:38.980
you never would’ve seen the body.

19:39.060 --> 19:42.060
In other words,
your ghost dog story reeks.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.900
There were
dead leaves everywhere.

19:43.940 --> 19:48.260
How do you make dog prints
in dead leaves, Detective Opie?

19:48.340 --> 19:50.300
I don't know.
Tell me.

19:50.340 --> 19:53.540
You're a tax attorney.
Good at making up fantasies.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.940
That's what
they pay you for, right?

19:56.940 --> 20:01.340
The dog was there. Jesus.

20:05.460 --> 20:08.100
Hold it, now.
Hold it. Hold on.

20:09.180 --> 20:10.980
Yesterday. Damn.

20:14.060 --> 20:17.260
They're all correct about Tango.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.540
I didn't pick him up at Ricardi's.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.500
I met him out on the path.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.820
Geez.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.780
Really had me going
there for a sec.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.340
Good.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.420
He gets out sometimes,
and he runs around the gardens.

20:36.580 --> 20:38.340
Half the time...

20:38.380 --> 20:41.540
Ricardi doesn't even know
he's missing until l bring him back.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.460
I remember now...

20:44.500 --> 20:46.340
that I called him.

20:46.420 --> 20:48.740
Tango, come here, boy.
Come on.

20:53.540 --> 20:56.580
- You just went off with him.
- Yeah, Tango's my buddy. Aren’t you?

20:58.660 --> 21:00.420
Go on. Go on. Run.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.700
Perhaps you'll understand
how our ears prick up...

21:03.780 --> 21:05.780
every time your story changes.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.380
Yes, and l certainly hope
this one works...

21:08.420 --> 21:11.700
because I'm banking on this lame
dog story to get me off the hook.

21:11.780 --> 21:14.340
Crap. How much longer
do I gotta put up with this--

21:14.420 --> 21:17.340
Owens!
You're out of line.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.780
Good boy.

21:22.820 --> 21:26.220
Speaking of dogs, you keep yours
on a leash. You don't need a lawsuit.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.220
Now, you listen to me, Victor.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.300
This is getting ridiculous.

21:30.340 --> 21:33.380
When you called me, you told me it was
gonna be ten minutes. Now look at this.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.180
I'm afraid it's gonna
take a little longer.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.300
I can see the notion of civic duty
and being a good citizen is just a myth.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.900
- I don't remember who said it--
- You don't seem to remember very much.

21:40.980 --> 21:45.100
I don't remember who said the police
will ensure public safety everywhere...

21:45.180 --> 21:46.860
except inside a police station.

21:46.940 --> 21:50.220
You called before anyone
knew Sue Ellen was missing.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.780
Well, does that
make me the murderer?

21:52.860 --> 21:56.260
It says right here,
''I ran home and called the police.''

21:56.340 --> 21:59.260
My God, there must have been
several places closer.

21:59.340 --> 22:01.220
I wasn't thinking.
I just ran home.

22:01.260 --> 22:02.980
Or maybe you thought,
''I'd better wash up first.''

22:03.060 --> 22:04.660
I don't like your tone.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.100
And frankly, I'm beginning to find
yours more and more interesting.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.060
What are you recording?

22:11.140 --> 22:13.220
Do you have any idea
why you're still here?

22:14.980 --> 22:16.740
Maybe you should call
a lawyer down here.

22:16.820 --> 22:18.500
I am a fucking lawyer!

22:20.540 --> 22:23.300
This is January 7, 8:06 P.M.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.940
San Juan Police Headquarters.
I'm Captain Benezet.

22:26.020 --> 22:27.780
With me is Detective Owens.

22:27.820 --> 22:29.700
We're talking
to Mr. Henry Hearst.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.140
Do you have your permission
to tape this interview, Henry?

22:32.220 --> 22:35.300
Why not?
I have nothing to hide.

22:35.340 --> 22:36.980
Thank you.

22:37.060 --> 22:40.620
Now, then--your name, age,
profession and marital status.

22:40.700 --> 22:41.900
Come on.

22:41.980 --> 22:46.020
Name, age, profession
and marital status, please.

22:46.100 --> 22:49.380
You just said my name.
Fine. Whatever.

22:49.420 --> 22:52.980
Hearst. Henry Buchanan Hearst.
I'm 57.

22:53.060 --> 22:55.580
Your house is called ''The Ilado''
up on Old San Juan Hill...

22:55.660 --> 22:56.700
and you're an attorney?

22:56.780 --> 23:00.900
Yes. Senior partner with Hearst,
Dean and Dumet right here in town.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.700
You must have a lot of fancy computers
up there in that office.

23:03.780 --> 23:06.980
You ever surf the Net? Check out
the chat rooms and the websites?

23:07.020 --> 23:08.900
I don't know about chat rooms,
but sure.

23:08.940 --> 23:11.180
What does this have
to do with anything?

23:11.260 --> 23:12.620
Any other hobbies?

23:13.940 --> 23:16.420
Computers are not my hobby.
Photography is.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.900
I have my own darkroom.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.740
I enjoy chronicling
the island's history.

23:20.780 --> 23:23.660
- And you're married.
- Yes.

23:24.700 --> 23:27.460
- Ten years now.
- And no children.

23:27.540 --> 23:30.260
Yes. And no children.

23:30.340 --> 23:31.740
Why not?

23:31.820 --> 23:34.820
Chantal won't--
Chantal can't have children.

23:34.900 --> 23:36.980
She can't, or she won't?

23:37.060 --> 23:39.100
She has a fertility problem.
What difference does it make?

23:40.020 --> 23:44.100
You ever hear of adopting?
You walk somebody else's dog.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.540
That's true tact.
That's very elegant.

23:49.740 --> 23:51.620
Do you think that's elegant?

23:55.620 --> 23:58.180
This is what I think.

23:58.260 --> 24:02.500
I remember that
you couldn't afford law school.

24:02.540 --> 24:06.660
I remember you waiting on tables.
We'd swagger in, drunk...

24:06.700 --> 24:10.820
trotting along hot-looking dolls,
spending money you know we didn't earn.

24:13.460 --> 24:16.940
I think the matter at hand is payback.
That's what I think.

24:37.860 --> 24:42.020
When Detective Owens arrived
at your house at 6:54 P.M. yesterday...

24:42.100 --> 24:45.460
he noted that you were not
wearing jogging clothes.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.940
- I showered.
- Before you called?

24:49.020 --> 24:50.180
Of course not.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.340
l called as soon as l came home.

24:55.940 --> 24:57.900
911. What is your emergency?

24:57.980 --> 25:01.260
I want to report a dead body.

25:06.340 --> 25:10.260
Officers also noted that your wife
had not yet been told about the girl.

25:10.340 --> 25:12.380
She was in the bedroom.

25:15.860 --> 25:17.700
It says here you called
from the bedroom.

25:17.740 --> 25:20.020
You had to lie down.
You were distraught.

25:21.300 --> 25:24.500
- We'd had an argument.
- When you got home?

25:26.180 --> 25:28.620
No, earlier. Please don't
go into this now, Victor.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.980
- It's none of your business!
- Damn it, Henry!

25:31.060 --> 25:34.380
Chantal was in the bedroom. She was not.
The dog was with you. The dog was not.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.220
Tell me one thing that adds up...

25:36.260 --> 25:38.340
so we can go across the street
and have a good time.

25:44.900 --> 25:48.460
It's a pity that you've never been
to our home. Then you'd understand.

25:48.540 --> 25:49.580
But I was.

25:50.820 --> 25:54.300
I was there.
Downstairs there's that--

25:54.380 --> 25:57.780
- Upstairs it gets instructive.
- There's nothing real special about it.

25:57.860 --> 25:59.620
Mr. Hearst didn't say ''special.''

26:01.020 --> 26:02.620
He said ''instructive.''

26:02.700 --> 26:03.860
Thank you.

26:05.700 --> 26:07.820
Well, let's see.
Upstairs.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.580
There's a hallway, right?
There's along hallway.

26:11.620 --> 26:14.020
-Sixty feet.
- Possibly.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.740
- Definitely.
- I count five rooms up here.

26:16.820 --> 26:20.740
The extra bedrooms were
for the children, which were never used.

26:21.460 --> 26:25.420
The guest bedroom was
redecorated for my wife.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.140
Our old room is now mine.

26:30.940 --> 26:33.460
In between...

26:35.860 --> 26:37.300
the hallway.

26:38.340 --> 26:40.740
Sixty feet long.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.140
You have separate bedrooms.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.860
My lovely Chantal's affliction
is the green-eyed monster.

26:51.580 --> 26:54.780
They say that jealousy is all the fun
you think somebody else is having.

26:55.940 --> 26:59.860
Chantal can be unbearable,
I promise you.

26:59.940 --> 27:01.940
She have reason to be?

27:06.660 --> 27:10.140
Regardless of what you think of me,
I do love my wife.

27:10.220 --> 27:12.020
I've always loved her.

27:14.180 --> 27:16.780
The only thing I ever wanted
was to be happy with Chantal...

27:16.860 --> 27:19.260
and have children.

27:21.220 --> 27:23.220
But the pitter-patter
of little feet...

27:24.260 --> 27:25.820
was not to be.

27:36.260 --> 27:40.020
- Check those out.
- I certainly would like to.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.340
It certainly pays to advertise.

27:42.380 --> 27:46.700
Ben, Thomas, I caught you in the act.
Married men should be more subtle.

27:48.580 --> 27:51.580
- Where's Henry?
- He'll be right along.

27:51.660 --> 27:53.940
Had a business matter to tidy up.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.020
I thought I saw him
walking into the police station...

27:56.100 --> 27:58.300
as we drove up to the valet.

27:59.740 --> 28:02.380
He'll be right along.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.100
Well, what do we discuss now?

28:09.180 --> 28:12.260
We've pretty much
exhausted canaries and dogs.

28:12.340 --> 28:17.740
Let's talk about the first murder,
if you don't mind, down in La Perla.

28:28.460 --> 28:31.300
Happened not too long ago,
just over two weeks.

28:32.660 --> 28:35.340
Little girl's body was found.
Paulina Valera.

28:36.580 --> 28:38.340
Twelve years old.

28:38.380 --> 28:40.620
Poor island girl.

28:40.700 --> 28:43.940
Mother was a street hooker
living in a motel not too far away.

28:51.420 --> 28:53.500
We think it started
somewhere in the streets.

28:53.540 --> 28:56.420
Paulina was lured or she ran.

28:56.460 --> 28:59.660
Either way, the killer
left her body in the dump.

29:04.420 --> 29:05.820
Yeah?

29:08.340 --> 29:10.180
Tell him I'll be right out.

29:13.340 --> 29:15.140
When I get back, Henry...

29:15.180 --> 29:17.420
I want you to tell me what
you were doing in La Perla...

29:17.500 --> 29:19.780
the night
Paulina Valera was killed.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.740
Superintendent.

29:26.820 --> 29:30.180
I'm waiting to introduce
good citizen Henry Hearst...

29:32.740 --> 29:35.660
in, let's see, 29 minutes.

29:35.740 --> 29:39.980
- And I'm told he's still in there.
- That's right.

29:40.060 --> 29:43.380
Victor, do you realize how important
this fund-raising event is?

29:43.460 --> 29:46.300
Yes, we have two dead girls.

29:46.340 --> 29:48.580
But we also
have countless children...

29:48.660 --> 29:51.820
whose homes were
blown away in the hurricane.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.980
We have open sewers.

29:54.060 --> 29:56.660
- We have a cholera epidemic.
- Sir, I realize--

29:56.740 --> 29:59.460
You obviously do not.

30:01.860 --> 30:05.700
How will the sponsors react
if Henry's accused?

30:05.780 --> 30:10.260
I imagine extremely grateful
that their children are safe.

30:10.340 --> 30:12.860
Just have him across the street...

30:12.900 --> 30:14.540
by 9:00, okay?

30:37.500 --> 30:39.700
- What time you got?
- Time to go.

30:39.780 --> 30:41.660
- Your pulse is racing.
- I'm due to give my speech!

30:41.740 --> 30:44.180
Speech? Yes, I know.
I've been told.

30:44.260 --> 30:46.820
Two patrol officers wrote down
the license plate number...

30:46.900 --> 30:49.980
of your Range Rover, which was parked
in the vicinity of the crime scene.

30:51.740 --> 30:54.140
Your expensive vehicle
attracted attention.

30:55.300 --> 30:58.980
Officers thought it might be stolen,
called it in.

31:00.020 --> 31:01.860
That puts you in the area, Henry.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.940
Any time you're ready.

31:12.020 --> 31:14.460
Me, I'm just hoping this is
as good as ghost dog.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.900
You know where you were
three weeks ago, Sergeant Opie?

31:16.980 --> 31:20.380
I was right here serving coffee
to stand-up citizens like yourself.

31:29.100 --> 31:34.420
I was at my sister-in-law's.
I had knocked back a few at the club...

31:34.500 --> 31:37.860
and l had this inspiration to drop off
some Christmas gifts for the kids.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.900
Name and address, Henry.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.660
l don't know the exact address,
but l know where it is.

31:42.700 --> 31:44.740
it’s Maria and Paco Rodriguez.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.260
Should be in the book.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.260
Chantal's older sister.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.940
Great kids.

32:10.020 --> 32:11.980
- How are you?
- Fine.

32:15.940 --> 32:18.820
Maria's done
a fabulous job with them.

32:20.500 --> 32:22.900
Merry Christmas.

32:28.620 --> 32:30.860
Why didn't Chantal go with you?
It's her sister.

32:32.260 --> 32:33.660
It's complicated.

32:36.660 --> 32:39.380
Paco. Merry Christmas.

32:40.780 --> 32:43.780
I need to know more about this.

32:43.860 --> 32:45.660
No, you don't.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.420
l talked to her.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.420
She gave up a little bit of dirt.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.260
She says that
it's the first time...

33:16.340 --> 33:18.660
that either Henry or Chantal...

33:18.740 --> 33:20.500
had stopped by in a long time.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.580
She didn't sound too friendly.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.740
Why you pick that night
to thaw the ice?

33:24.820 --> 33:28.020
- It has nothing to do with anything.
- Where'd you go next?

33:28.100 --> 33:29.580
I went home.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.260
Police reported
your car at 2:18 A.M.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.700
You see, this is what we here
at the police--

33:35.780 --> 33:39.060
We call it a window
of opportunity.

33:45.860 --> 33:49.540
I was driving drunk.
I was just driving terribly.

33:58.820 --> 34:01.940
l most definitely needed
to walk off the liquor.

34:20.699 --> 34:23.580
La Perla's not a good idea
for a man wearing Armani.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.340
it was a beautiful night.

34:33.020 --> 34:36.420
- This place doesn't scare me.
- Well, it should.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.940
So? Where did you go?

34:41.980 --> 34:43.460
l found a bench.

34:46.179 --> 34:47.780
l sat down.

34:49.060 --> 34:52.260
l found a bench.
l sat down. l fell asleep.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.420
Found a bench.
Woke up I don't know when.

35:02.660 --> 35:05.500
Felt better. I went home.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.180
What's gonna stop me from
shoving my fist down his throat?

35:10.260 --> 35:12.540
The police would rather
that I drove home drunk?

35:12.580 --> 35:14.180
All right, Henry.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.500
Let's revisit this...

35:18.420 --> 35:19.860
bench later.

35:21.020 --> 35:23.140
First I want an answer
to my question...

35:23.220 --> 35:26.140
as to why Chantal didn't
accompany you that night.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.540
It's between the sisters.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.820
l met Paco Rodriguez.
He's a hot local artist.

35:30.900 --> 35:32.940
Busted him once smoking grass.

35:33.020 --> 35:35.620
- Who doesn't on this island?
- You smoke a little grass, Henry?

35:35.700 --> 35:39.740
Do you? God knows it would help
with your sunny disposition.

35:39.820 --> 35:42.940
I'm thinking you don't
fancy Chantal hanging out...

35:42.980 --> 35:47.900
with a handsome,
successful younger man.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.460
- Do you?
- Is this necessary?

35:49.540 --> 35:51.020
How old was Chantal
when you married her?

35:51.100 --> 35:54.060
- Twenty. Right, Henry?
- You're, what, 67, right?

35:54.140 --> 35:57.340
I'm 57!
Goddamn it, 57!

35:58.580 --> 36:01.500
This is a fucking outrage.
You know that?

36:01.540 --> 36:04.300
You've no right to pry
into my private affairs...

36:04.380 --> 36:06.580
with these
soap opera insinuations.

36:07.220 --> 36:10.780
Look at you, Victor.
Doing a bang-up job policing the island.

36:10.860 --> 36:14.140
Drugs everywhere.
Just-- Crime is rampant.

36:14.180 --> 36:17.340
Superintendent, my butt. You'll
be lucky if you still have a job.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.140
I'm sorry.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.340
I'm really sorry.

36:50.420 --> 36:54.140
This is really rather
unbearable for me.

36:58.780 --> 37:00.700
I don't suppose that...

37:00.780 --> 37:03.460
Detective Owens could
get me a cold drink.

37:10.180 --> 37:11.940
If you would, Detective.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.620
My pleasure.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.620
All right, Henry.

37:30.660 --> 37:32.580
What's going on here?

37:32.660 --> 37:34.860
Do you have anything...

37:34.940 --> 37:38.060
a little stronger
stashed away around here?

37:50.940 --> 37:54.060
Okay, Victor. What's it gonna
take to get me out of here?

37:54.140 --> 37:57.100
We both know that I could
march in an army of attorneys.

37:57.180 --> 37:59.900
I'm intrigued they're
not here already, Henry.

38:02.140 --> 38:06.500
You're hiding something, something you
don't want to get outside this room.

38:10.060 --> 38:12.020
Now it's just you and me.

38:13.980 --> 38:16.060
Tell me about Chantal.

38:18.580 --> 38:22.060
You tell me
about Kate and Consuelo.

38:22.140 --> 38:25.180
If having a difficult marriage
makes me a murderer...

38:25.220 --> 38:27.180
you'd be Son of Sam.

38:29.180 --> 38:30.740
Touché.

38:34.260 --> 38:35.860
Kate and I...

38:36.900 --> 38:38.220
married too young.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.260
She grew to want somebody better.

38:41.340 --> 38:44.660
A man with a real job...

38:46.220 --> 38:48.180
money to buy things
she came to know...

38:48.260 --> 38:50.340
that other men were only
too happy to buy for her.

38:52.340 --> 38:54.420
And Consuelo--

38:54.500 --> 38:56.620
Consuelo just hates
me being a cop.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.180
You stuck with your guns.

38:58.260 --> 39:00.860
You can't tell me
being a cop isn't exciting.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.420
And you obviously enjoy
harassing people.

39:07.460 --> 39:10.100
You don't see folks running
up to me at cocktail soirees saying...

39:10.180 --> 39:14.340
''Gee whiz, a tax attorney. Wow.
What a cool job. Wish I could do that.''

39:14.420 --> 39:16.860
Wouldn't mind
what you got, Henry.

39:18.460 --> 39:20.380
Used to be enough.

39:23.860 --> 39:25.940
Chantal's green monster...

39:26.020 --> 39:28.140
extends to her sister's marriage.

39:28.220 --> 39:32.220
You see, Maria married for other
more tried and true reasons...

39:32.300 --> 39:35.020
despite her mother's objections.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.140
Married a man
closer to her own age.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.060
A man of modest means.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.820
Dashing young artist.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.900
Beautiful women.

39:44.980 --> 39:48.060
They are a breed unto themselves.
Wouldn't you agree?

39:48.140 --> 39:51.580
A beautiful woman
moves through life unchallenged...

39:52.820 --> 39:54.860
men giving them
everything that they want.

39:54.940 --> 39:58.780
First their daddies,
then their boyfriends and husbands.

39:58.820 --> 40:02.860
- I'll drink to that.
- For some, beauty is their only talent.

40:04.660 --> 40:06.700
There's always
somebody more beautiful.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.220
Somebody younger.

40:10.020 --> 40:12.420
Chantal's mother taught her that.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.700
Why are you doing this
to me, Victor?

40:17.780 --> 40:21.180
I certainly hope you've gotten your
petty thrill pulling back the curtain.

40:21.260 --> 40:23.380
But there's nothing more to see.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.580
I'll tell you what I see, Henry.

40:28.700 --> 40:32.420
I see the bodies
of two young girls, murdered.

40:32.500 --> 40:35.060
The man who did that's
going to answer to me.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.940
You make me sick.

40:37.020 --> 40:38.940
Why do you keep saying
''The man who did it...

40:38.980 --> 40:40.660
the one responsible, the killer''?

40:40.740 --> 40:42.740
Why don't you put a name
to this phantom--

40:42.820 --> 40:45.180
Henry Hearst, attorney-at-law--

40:45.220 --> 40:47.780
if you're so convinced
that I'm guilty?

40:49.060 --> 40:51.940
Construing my marriage
to be dysfunctional...

40:52.020 --> 40:54.340
just makes it easier for you
to sell me down the river.

40:54.420 --> 40:56.860
I'm being convinced,
but not all the way.

40:58.340 --> 41:02.180
- That's why you're still here.
- I'm still here because I choose to be.

41:02.260 --> 41:04.940
Because you asked me
if I would ''drop by.''

41:05.020 --> 41:07.780
Because you fed me
this line of crap...

41:07.820 --> 41:09.580
about a couple of questions.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.940
But now--
Now I'm leaving.

41:12.980 --> 41:14.780
I've told my story to exhaustion.

41:14.820 --> 41:17.620
I've got a ballroom full of people
waiting for me over there...

41:17.700 --> 41:20.500
to give my toast
in exactly 1 2 minutes.

41:20.580 --> 41:23.940
And I've suffered enough insults
and accusations for any friend to bear.

41:23.940 --> 41:24.420
And I've suffered enough insults
and accusations for any friend to bear.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.420
You're not going anywhere, Henry.

41:27.580 --> 41:29.620
What, are you gonna sick
this knuckle-dragger on me?

41:29.700 --> 41:31.260
In that case, be careful.

41:31.340 --> 41:34.980
Be very careful, because
you only have so many possibilities.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.380
You remember:
I know something about the law.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.740
I'm gonna walk right out that door
unless you book me here and now.

41:40.820 --> 41:43.180
How about I detain you
on suspicion?

41:43.260 --> 41:44.620
Are you serious?

41:47.020 --> 41:49.060
Read him his rights.

41:50.580 --> 41:53.740
Step inside.
You have the right to remain silent.

41:53.820 --> 41:56.900
- Anything you say can and will be--
- On what charge?

41:56.980 --> 42:00.180
Taking a nap on a bench?
Walking a dog without permission?

42:00.260 --> 42:03.380
Two counts, first-degree murder.
Special circumstances.

42:03.460 --> 42:05.500
Two counts, rape...

42:05.580 --> 42:07.940
upon the persons of Sue Ellen Huddy
and Paulina Valera.

42:10.380 --> 42:12.260
I raped them as well, huh?

42:12.300 --> 42:15.380
If you cannot afford an attorney,
the court will appoint one for you.

42:15.460 --> 42:18.420
Now, do you understand these rights
that have been explained to you?

42:24.580 --> 42:26.740
See you outside a minute, please.

42:32.860 --> 42:34.700
He's one hundred
fucking percent guilty.

42:34.780 --> 42:36.700
He knows exactly where
we're taking him.

42:36.740 --> 42:40.020
Yeah, you made sure of that.
Thank you. Now, what if he lawyers up?

42:40.100 --> 42:43.340
He opens his wallet and trots in
some hardball mouthpiece--

42:43.420 --> 42:46.180
- That's it. We lose him.
- We already had him.

42:46.260 --> 42:49.900
''I was sleeping on a park bench.''
I mean, my ass!

42:49.980 --> 42:52.780
You're playing it soft.
Why are you butterballing him?

42:52.860 --> 42:56.100
Why don't you let me go in there
and let me drop the hammer on that guy?

42:56.140 --> 42:57.940
I'm gonna walk across the street.

42:58.020 --> 43:00.460
You go back in there,
and you sit with him.

43:00.540 --> 43:03.300
And you keep your mouth shut.
Okay?

43:03.340 --> 43:04.740
Shut!

43:40.700 --> 43:42.900
I saw Victor's eyes.

43:45.100 --> 43:49.980
And your nostrils seem
to have a new flare to them.

43:50.060 --> 43:53.180
As in, your butt got chewed
for blowing the pooch.

43:56.940 --> 44:00.060
Our notorious captain would love
to have ambushed me with that tidbit...

44:00.100 --> 44:03.180
and owned the most
devastating moment.

44:06.420 --> 44:08.140
Yeah.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.700
- You okay with that?
- What?

44:13.740 --> 44:16.580
I didn't know-- diet or regular.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.460
Bet they're fast, huh?

44:25.540 --> 44:27.100
Excuse me?

44:27.180 --> 44:28.980
Little girls.

44:29.060 --> 44:31.300
I bet they run really fast...

44:31.380 --> 44:33.420
when you're chasing 'em.

44:34.500 --> 44:37.500
You'll be running quick, too,
when I file my lawsuit.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.900
You're telling me to let a man--

44:40.980 --> 44:43.660
whom I think
in all probability...

44:43.740 --> 44:46.580
killed two young girls--
walk out of the station?

44:46.660 --> 44:49.380
For ten minutes, Victor.

44:50.980 --> 44:53.700
- Has he confessed?
- Of course not.

44:53.740 --> 44:55.940
You have proof enough
to arrest him?

44:56.020 --> 44:58.100
I've caught him
in a number of lies.

44:58.180 --> 45:00.580
You need more than a few lies.

45:00.660 --> 45:02.980
And until you have them...

45:03.060 --> 45:06.500
I don't want him
retained officially.

45:09.220 --> 45:11.580
Don't tell me you already--

45:11.660 --> 45:13.900
Five minutes ago.
I thought he might take off.

45:13.980 --> 45:16.540
He has to make his toast!

45:18.860 --> 45:20.740
Bring him here.

45:20.780 --> 45:22.980
No uniformed officer.

45:23.820 --> 45:25.500
No restraint of any kind.

45:25.580 --> 45:27.140
See to it...

45:27.860 --> 45:29.140
Captain.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.940
Well, this is nice.

45:34.980 --> 45:36.980
A little alone time.

45:43.460 --> 45:45.380
You know, I like you, Henry.

45:46.420 --> 45:48.420
Can you believe it?

45:48.500 --> 45:51.300
A couple of girls strangled, raped.

45:51.380 --> 45:53.340
And yet you maintain
a sense of humor about it.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.940
Raped and strangled.

45:57.180 --> 45:58.380
What?

45:59.780 --> 46:01.540
You said ''strangled and raped.''

46:01.620 --> 46:03.460
I wouldn't know, especially...

46:03.540 --> 46:06.060
but these things should
be put in their proper order.

46:06.140 --> 46:07.980
Don't you agree, Detective?

46:08.060 --> 46:10.020
Do you call to them?

46:14.580 --> 46:16.780
What do I know?

46:16.860 --> 46:19.460
Could be the poor kids,
they lured you...

46:19.540 --> 46:22.260
off into the woods
and seduced you.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.900
It happens.

46:24.980 --> 46:27.100
You sound obsessed.

46:27.140 --> 46:28.980
You like this sort of thing.

46:30.820 --> 46:32.860
I'm just curious.

46:32.900 --> 46:35.580
I'm curious how you operate.

46:35.620 --> 46:37.340
Now...

46:37.380 --> 46:41.220
these little girls-- I bet they run
like rabbits, don't they?

46:43.020 --> 46:46.660
Come on.
Tell me about it.

46:46.700 --> 46:48.580
What do you do?

46:50.460 --> 46:52.380
Touch 'em?
You touch 'em like that?

46:53.660 --> 46:55.340
What, did that hurt?

46:58.460 --> 47:01.060
You hurt 'em, don't you?
The little girls.

47:02.100 --> 47:04.020
- Do you kiss them?
- Cut it out!

47:05.900 --> 47:08.300
''What's your name, sweetheart?

47:08.380 --> 47:09.740
Paulina?

47:09.820 --> 47:13.580
That's a pretty name.
It's sexy, yeah.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.500
Are you here all by yourself?

47:18.460 --> 47:20.260
I am too.

47:22.420 --> 47:25.220
Cute top. It's a tight little blouse
you got on there.

47:25.300 --> 47:27.500
God, you're a hot little cutie.

47:27.580 --> 47:29.220
I just wanna put my--''

47:30.700 --> 47:32.860
Where are you going, little girl?

47:42.820 --> 47:44.100
Back.

47:45.460 --> 47:47.340
- Get your hands off me.
- Get back in the office.

48:05.660 --> 48:06.700
You--

48:09.820 --> 48:12.020
You son of a bitch.

48:12.100 --> 48:14.620
It's the captain.
Line three.

48:20.980 --> 48:22.380
He what?

48:23.580 --> 48:26.100
Never mind, Owens.
Never mind!

48:26.180 --> 48:28.940
Just bring him here.
Bring him here now!

48:29.020 --> 48:31.140
He has a speech to make.

48:36.580 --> 48:39.820
When you've fixed your rug,
I gotta run you over.

48:39.900 --> 48:42.260
Haven't you done that already?

48:49.100 --> 48:51.980
Would you please get your hands
off me? Please!

48:52.060 --> 48:55.100
My God, Henry! What happened?

48:55.180 --> 48:57.060
Have you met my new tailor
and hair stylist...

48:57.100 --> 48:59.700
the '' Marquis de fucking Sade''?

48:59.780 --> 49:03.220
Look! This is nothing less than assault
and battery, and I have witnesses!

49:03.300 --> 49:05.860
- Witnesses to what?
- You knocked me down the stairs!

49:05.940 --> 49:08.580
- You attempted to escape!
- That's bullshit!

49:09.540 --> 49:11.020
Come on!

49:11.100 --> 49:13.140
- Let's go have a serious discu--
-Just cut the crap.

49:13.220 --> 49:16.540
- What?
- Henry, people are depending on you.

49:16.620 --> 49:19.660
- Shut up. Just shut up.
- Shut up, Julio.

49:24.340 --> 49:26.180
Do you mind?

49:27.460 --> 49:29.380
Ruthanne,
you're looking lovely, as usual.

49:29.460 --> 49:33.500
- Henry, is everything okay?
- Yes, fine.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.580
Thank you very much.

49:40.180 --> 49:42.540
It's all right.

49:42.620 --> 49:44.140
Isabella, hola.

49:47.660 --> 49:49.380
Wait.

49:49.460 --> 49:52.140
Just pray that I'm guilty
of killing those girls...

49:52.220 --> 49:55.460
because if I am,
then your boys worked over a monster.

49:55.540 --> 50:00.220
It'll be brushed under the carpet. But
if I'm not, the monster changes sides.

50:00.260 --> 50:03.420
Henry,
just give us that money smile.

50:09.700 --> 50:11.380
Shit.

50:13.700 --> 50:15.700
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

50:16.260 --> 50:17.980
Happy San Sebastian.

50:18.060 --> 50:20.540
I'm proud to introduce a man...

50:20.620 --> 50:24.340
who along with his lovely wife
Chantal Hearst...

50:26.620 --> 50:31.140
has championed many charity causes
in Puerto Rico.

50:31.220 --> 50:35.740
And in the wake of Hurricane Lucy,
we need him more than ever.

50:35.780 --> 50:38.860
So, Henry, get over here
and empty these people's pockets.

50:45.580 --> 50:47.620
Where's his fucking hair?

50:51.340 --> 50:53.660
Had the damn thing upside down.

50:55.460 --> 50:58.260
Thank you very much
for coming tonight.

50:58.340 --> 51:01.380
Where you been?
Got a lot of catchin' up to do.

51:01.460 --> 51:03.620
I'm right behind you.

51:06.500 --> 51:11.780
When nature sends its worst, it's
as if one of God's checks has bounced.

51:11.860 --> 51:14.100
Let's pray your checks don't.

51:15.140 --> 51:19.820
Because that's why we're here.
Hurricane Lucy ripped across--

51:19.900 --> 51:22.660
They say no amount of learning
can cure stupidity.

51:22.700 --> 51:25.340
-You're certainly a candidate for--
-If he'd cracked, you'd have come back--

51:25.380 --> 51:30.020
Well, he didn't crack,
and you're off this investigation.

51:30.100 --> 51:32.420
- What?
- Don't, Detective.

51:32.500 --> 51:36.180
Learn the grammar of silence
while you still hold that rank.

51:36.260 --> 51:38.460
Now, you go back to the station.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.460
Go home.
Put on a silly hat.

51:41.540 --> 51:43.380
Do whatever morons do.

51:47.460 --> 51:51.900
The island is a family,
one that has been torn apart.

51:51.980 --> 51:56.420
We need to be there for each other,
especially for our children.

51:58.940 --> 52:01.460
For there's no greater gift
than a child's smile.

52:03.540 --> 52:07.620
I want him back. Now. Tonight.
Not tomorrow.

52:09.020 --> 52:12.180
Victor, don't underestimate...

52:12.260 --> 52:16.100
the resolve of Henry Hearst
and his law firm...

52:16.180 --> 52:19.180
to raise your severed head
on a pole...

52:19.260 --> 52:21.980
and wave it
for the whole damn island to see.

52:22.740 --> 52:25.300
We'll see whose head
gets waved on that pole.

52:29.220 --> 52:33.180
Well, that's your decision,
then...

52:33.260 --> 52:35.060
isn't it?

52:35.140 --> 52:39.420
In closing, I'd like to ask you
to look into your hearts...

52:39.500 --> 52:41.700
realize what truly matters
in life...

52:41.780 --> 52:45.980
and find the love
to help our family.

52:52.940 --> 52:55.420
Perhaps catastrophe...

52:55.500 --> 52:58.740
is the natural human environment.

52:58.820 --> 53:02.460
We find ourselves attacked
by unforeseen forces come to harm us...

53:02.500 --> 53:05.580
even though we are innocent
of any wrong doing.

53:07.780 --> 53:12.900
But it is human nature to overcome,
if we work together.

53:12.940 --> 53:15.900
So, please,
help me help the children.

53:15.940 --> 53:17.500
Thank you.

53:51.420 --> 53:53.460
You know,
as if I wasn't embarrassed enough...

53:53.540 --> 53:57.220
you jerked me out of there without
being able to chat or have dinner.

53:57.300 --> 54:00.220
- I'm hungry, damn it!
- You like chocolate?

54:00.260 --> 54:02.300
There's a whole machine full of it
in the hallway...

54:02.380 --> 54:04.260
and I know you've got money.

54:05.300 --> 54:07.900
- You can't treat me like this.
- Of course I can!

54:09.220 --> 54:12.540
You'll eat, Henry.
Food is the least of your problems.

54:13.540 --> 54:16.060
I'm going to do the best I can
to see you get three squares a day.

54:22.940 --> 54:24.860
Come with me.

54:24.940 --> 54:29.540
Will you hold my husband all night?
How long could that be?

54:38.460 --> 54:40.940
Would you like to have a private chat
with your wife?

54:45.220 --> 54:47.340
This is Detective Castillo.

54:47.420 --> 54:52.700
He's going to set up a video camera
in here while I chat with Chantal.

54:52.740 --> 54:54.940
Why must you question her?

54:58.500 --> 55:01.540
Detective Castillo
will get you some food.

55:16.100 --> 55:19.020
- I should tell you the--
- Do it outside.

55:21.220 --> 55:23.340
Victor,
I need to know what's happening.

55:23.420 --> 55:26.180
Just give me a moment
while I close the door.

55:26.220 --> 55:28.820
She came in-- She was-- to me--

55:29.900 --> 55:32.860
Is Henry here? Can I see him?

55:34.340 --> 55:37.700
- I need to see him.
- Doesn't want to talk to you.

55:40.380 --> 55:43.860
If he's innocent,
why is this taking so long?

55:44.660 --> 55:46.260
I never said he was innocent.

55:54.500 --> 55:56.940
Tell me about your lives together
as a couple.

56:00.340 --> 56:02.620
You could start
with the separate bedrooms.

56:04.900 --> 56:06.660
He talked about that?

56:08.420 --> 56:10.740
- And what else?
- Your sister.

56:17.740 --> 56:20.460
Don't you offer
to light a lady's cigarette?

56:40.540 --> 56:43.860
Tell me about the night he...

56:43.940 --> 56:46.460
visited your sister's home.

56:47.500 --> 56:49.740
What night would that be?

56:49.820 --> 56:54.900
December 19, Sunday night,
about 9:00 in the evening.

56:54.980 --> 56:57.780
I find it curious that you chose
not to accompany him.

56:58.860 --> 57:02.460
I wasn't aware
Henry had visited my sister.

57:04.060 --> 57:05.780
Why wouldn't he tell you?

57:07.700 --> 57:09.980
Obviously Henry has talked to us
about your marriage...

57:10.020 --> 57:15.700
how you wish you had married someone
closer to your age, like Paco.

57:15.780 --> 57:19.300
You're saying Henry's jealous
of my sister's husband?

57:19.380 --> 57:21.260
Are you having an affair
with Paco?

57:21.340 --> 57:23.340
Am I on trial now?

57:29.060 --> 57:31.300
Can you tell me
what time he got home that night?

57:35.300 --> 57:39.540
There was a night
that could be it.

57:39.620 --> 57:41.820
l remember the front door.

57:42.900 --> 57:44.740
it’s old, very heavy.

57:46.340 --> 57:48.180
It tends to slam.

57:49.060 --> 57:51.100
Did you look at the clock?

57:55.620 --> 57:59.860
- You must've been worried.
- This wasn't the first time.

58:08.580 --> 58:09.780
Hello?

58:20.260 --> 58:22.780
Take me into that room.

58:42.740 --> 58:44.780
Why don't you answer me?

58:59.260 --> 59:03.700
And you didn't pursue it? Or didn't
you care to ask where he was?

59:05.340 --> 59:08.140
We don't ask those sort
of questions anymore.

59:09.220 --> 59:11.020
But I'm sure
you're going to tell me.

59:11.100 --> 59:14.140
We have reason to believe
he was in La Perla...

59:14.220 --> 59:17.180
where a young girl named Paulina Valera
was raped and murdered...

59:17.220 --> 59:19.100
and left on a garbage dump.

59:22.500 --> 59:25.100
I need to know whose name
the house is in.

59:26.540 --> 59:28.780
The house was a gift.

59:28.860 --> 59:31.740
Then may I have your permission
to search the house?

59:33.860 --> 59:35.220
You may not.

59:50.900 --> 59:53.900
- You said you were hungry.
- What'd she say?

59:55.460 --> 59:57.500
- You all set, Castillo?
- Yes, sir.

59:57.580 --> 59:59.460
Start recording.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.580
I was talking to you.

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:06.100
That's right. Victor only listens
when it suits Victor.

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.060
I listen, Henry.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.220
I was listening when you told me
you left your sister-in-law's...

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:14.860
and drove to La Perla, that you went
for a walk and fell asleep on a bench.

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:17.820
Now I'd like to hear something
that vaguely resembles the truth.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.500
- That is the truth.
- Chantal says you got home at 3:30 A.M.

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:24.300
I told you I went for a walk.
I was drunk. I--

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:30.540
- I may have had another drink.
- You happen onto Via Del Mar Boulevard?

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.820
Do you want to party with me?
What do you want?

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.500
- Did you see any hookers?
- No.

01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:03.180
- You didn't talk to any hookers?
- No.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.020
- Spend time with one, perhaps?
- Absolutely not.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.220
You're lying, Henry.

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:10.940
Your carotid artery
is pumping like crazy.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:14.100
And your eyes-- They turn down
and to the left.

01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.340
That's what liars do.
It's a fact.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:18.460
Our bodies give us away.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.940
Do you know what these do?

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.220
They keep me awake.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:32.780
I haven't been sleeping much.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:38.380
Since you found Sue Ellen Huddy's body,
I've been working straight through.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:42.820
And I've got so much
to share with you.

01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:46.460
For instance, I accompanied
those two officers...

01:01:46.540 --> 01:01:49.540
who phoned in the license number
from your Range Rover.

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.300
We went back to La Perla.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.700
They showed me
exactly where you parked.

01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.060
We conducted some interviews.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:59.740
Imagine my surprise when several
prostitutes recognized your photo...

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.700
said you'd been coming around
for months.

01:02:01.780 --> 01:02:03.980
Jesus Christ, Victor,
she's in the next room.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:08.020
I'm talking about street hookers,
needle users, crackheads...

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.460
not high-class call girls.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:12.460
Curb crawlers, for God's sake.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:17.940
My God. That old carotid artery
is pumping like gangbusters.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.820
God damn you.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:25.500
Chantal can't hear you,
not with the door closed.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:29.620
- Unless I turn the speaker on.
- Please.

01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:46.380
She was blond.

01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:49.060
Obviously peroxide,
being Hispanic.

01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:55.140
She would truly have been beautiful
without all that makeup.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.140
- I never knew her name.
- Do you miss me, huh?

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:04.060
Yes, you do.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.900
I left my sister-in-law's house...

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.740
to have sex in an alley
with a prostitute.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:17.220
I be a good little girl
for you. Little girl.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.420
I finished myself off...

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.900
drinking any goddamn thing
I wanted at the Sunshine Cafe.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.500
A whiskey.

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:44.580
What do you think? That I'd
spend my life banging on my wife's--

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.740
my wife's door?

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:53.140
I'd find a substitute...

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:58.540
someone just the opposite
from Chantal.

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:02.940
A prostitute is a woman
who will give you a great deal...

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:05.220
for relatively little money.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:19.180
Well, as an alibi,
I don't know, Henry.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.620
A lot of women in Puerto Rico
die their hair blond...

01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:27.700
especially in that profession,
but I'll tell you what I do know.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.260
One of them admitted she'd been with you
last week. Her name was Reina.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:35.500
- Do you know this man?
- No.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.660
Yes.

01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:43.580
She was young,
much younger than the others.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:48.580
And she says
that's why you like her.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.660
But this must be an old picture.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.140
- Why?
- The guy's bald now.

01:04:56.220 --> 01:04:58.780
- Bald?
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.860
You remove your hairpiece down there
as well, don’t you, Henry?

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.340
It seems nobody remembers you
with the rug.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.500
Trying not to be recognized.
That's smart.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.780
Pick 'em up in your car,
somebody might catch a license plate.

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:18.580
- ''This one likes it quick''--
- From behind.

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.780
He pumps me hard.

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:24.020
At least he comes fast.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:28.420
Then goes like he doesn't
want to be here.

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:31.220
But I like it fast.
Gets me back--

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.740
''...into my corner.''

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:36.940
But a week ago is no alibi,
is it, Henry?

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.260
Why, Henry?

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.540
Why here like this...

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.460
in the dirt?

01:05:57.380 --> 01:06:00.140
Think of the high-class escorts
you can buy.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:04.100
Suites at the Ritz.
Don Perignon. And you choose this.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.980
Don't tell her, will you,
Victor? Please.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.540
I imagine Chantal will be thrilled
to learn you were with a prostitute...

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.700
instead of what
you were really doing.

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.460
Rapists leave bodily fluids--

01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:34.260
semen...

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.220
DNA.

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:41.980
Your test'll prove
that it wasn't me.

01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:47.340
- You use condoms with your prostitutes?
- Of course.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.980
- What kind?
- I don't know.

01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:55.660
Trojans. Whatever they have.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.740
The killer used condoms.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.980
Chemical lubricants were found
in the victims. He's smart, like you.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:06.180
Knows all about our lab tests.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.340
Both victims were raped from behind.
Both victims were strangled from behind.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.580
Thumb and fingerprints
on the victims’ necks confirmed this.

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.780
Are you here all by yourself?

01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:21.740
Then you put the clothes
back on.

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.860
Dirt and leaves inside the garments
confirmed this, as well.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.420
- Pretty blouse you have on there.
- Then you pose them.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.260
Each on the side...

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.860
little heads
resting on cupped hands.

01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:38.260
And you combed their hair.

01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.060
The lack of debris suggests this.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.500
And we have reason
to believe you took their photograph.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.780
Stop it!

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:49.020
Photography is your hobby,
isn't it? Isn't it?

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:50.300
Stop it!

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:10.340
- What's wrong? You all right?
- I'm fine.

01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.020
- What's wrong? You all right?
- I'm fine.

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.780
You want some water?

01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.460
No. I'm perfectly fine.
I've never been better.

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.660
I'm just tired.

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:25.340
You don't look exactly
fresh as a daisy yourself.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:49.979
You surf, Henry?

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:55.500
The Internet? This is a statement
from your web-browser provider.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.300
Your E-mail address
is hhearst@elpuerto.com.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.740
You sometimes
use an on-line alias.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.620
'' Hard Body Hank''?

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:11.899
- Very catchy.
- God, does this ever end?

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.819
A simple yes or no, Henry.

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:19.380
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:23.420
It seems that Hard Body Hank
has visited several pornography sites...

01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:27.460
one of which
is called Barely Legal.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:30.500
It features young ladies
posed as schoolgirls.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.700
That website features women,
not children.

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:37.899
Christ.

01:09:38.939 --> 01:09:42.540
Every time I check E-mail, there's a new
message from some electronic bimbo...

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.260
luring me to her site.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.899
So I checked it out a few times.
What's the big deal?

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:51.939
And the prostitutes--
What does that prove? That I'm lonely?

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:57.500
That I don't get it at home? That
my wife makes me sleep down the hall?

01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:04.780
And all this makes me a pedophile,
a rapist, a killer of children?

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:12.540
- Why would I do such a thing?
- I don't know, Henry.

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.100
Not yet.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:22.980
Let's talk about this glamorous wife who
keeps poor Henry shivering in the hall.

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:27.380
- You know what Chantal says?
- She's lying!

01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:29.820
Whatever she said.
I never touched Camille.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.180
Who's Camille?

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:49.660
All right, Mrs. Hearst.
Let's talk about your separate bedrooms.

01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:54.260
Henry says it was his choice;
he moved out.

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.500
- He's wrong.
- He's wrong or he's lying?

01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.940
Let's not quibble over words.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.340
But words can be very amusing.

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.420
Words like ''conjugal duty,''
for instance...

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:08.460
which Henry claims you have not been
performing with willing good spirits.

01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.300
To be honest,
he says you're not performing at all.

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:14.460
He has been revealing things,
hasn't he?

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.660
I'd like to hear your side.

01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:22.260
The most interesting things--
Those I'm sure he kept to himself.

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.100
Not Camille, I'm afraid.

01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:29.420
That is the reason you sent him down the
hall with his toothbrush and wash cloth?

01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:38.140
He's out there...

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:43.860
afraid, hoping for a miracle...

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:47.660
that one day
things will turn out all right...

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.540
as long as nobody
speaks of them.

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.740
He's right to.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.580
To what? Hope?

01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:05.460
To be afraid.

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:13.060
Christmas Day, two years ago.

01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:18.540
We always used to spend Christmas
with Maria and Paco.

01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:22.220
Of course this was before.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:27.020
Yeah.
That's what I understand.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.900
I couldn't wait to see my niece.

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.020
Camille.

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:38.140
Their children were special...

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.820
with an extra share of magic...

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.500
and grace and purity.

01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.660
Camille was one of them.

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.660
Henry and I
were extremely fond of her.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:57.420
How are you?

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.420
- They seem very close.
- Don't they?

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.620
- You look great!
- You too.

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:10.260
We were all having a good time,
the way families should beat Christmas.

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:12.580
- But then Henry got drunk.
- Red, anybody?

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:16.020
- No, thanks.
- You've already poured it out.

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:18.420
- I have.
- He started making remarks...

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.700
- Please excuse my husband.
- about me and Paco.

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.340
Excuse the husband, yeah.
Something Paco seems very adept at.

01:13:27.420 --> 01:13:29.300
- It was embarrassing.
- Henry.

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:30.900
l was angry.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.700
- This the first time?
- No.

01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:39.340
Is it some kind of secret
that Paco finds my Chantal enchanting?

01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:42.460
- Henry, don't.
- So what did you do?

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.820
- Don't what?
- I told him to shut up.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.100
Just don't.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:01.300
After dinner...

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:04.140
Maria and I opened our presents.

01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.700
- Books for me...
- Thanks.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.580
she wanted to read...

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:12.860
and jewelry for her
that l wanted to wear.

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.300
Why I got up when I did,
I don't know.

01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:29.180
Unless
you call intuition a reason.

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.380
But he wasn't there.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:43.260
Something led me
toward the bedrooms.

01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:48.020
- I don't get it.
- Come here.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.780
- They were there...
- Let me see.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:57.220
in her room.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.980
- Yes.
- Thank you.

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.100
He was talking,
and she was listening.

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:06.380
l couldn't tell you
what he was saying...

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.460
but the way he talked to her...

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.500
was the way
you talk to a woman.

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:17.540
l remember how she smiled,
the look in her eyes.

01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:26.380
He had no right
to make her smile that way.

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:35.260
And you continued
to stay together...

01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.340
each at your own
separate ends of the hall.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.380
And you never had sex since?

01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:47.060
You're putting on quite a show
for Henry, aren’t you?

01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:49.460
Right now,
he can't hear you.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.060
Once a woman decides
that's it's not important--

01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.980
Even when l would try
to get things back to normal...

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:01.940
that image was always with me.

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.260
And since you can't
have children--

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.180
Of course I can.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:21.140
Would you mind telling me
how old you were when you and Henry met?

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:27.460
I think I was about 1 1
when we came over from Europe.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:30.900
Henry became
my father's attorney here.

01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:36.460
They sailed together.
He was always around.

01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:40.540
In our families, you could always
find some friend of your father's...

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.980
with a boat in St. Thomas
or a penthouse in Manhattan.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:47.140
And that man was Henry.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.580
Now, your father--

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.780
He died when you were what?

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.740
Fourteen.

01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.300
And Henry
became your surrogate father?

01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:04.580
He paid for my college.

01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.420
And that's
when you became lovers?

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.380
I wasn't interested
in boys my age.

01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.740
Spring break. I couldn't wait.

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:21.900
We did it on Henry's yacht,
then in hotels...

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:26.100
in cars, on beaches, everywhere.

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.180
He was different with me.
He was tender.

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:38.260
We had a time, Henry and I.

01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:42.140
I can imagine.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:48.540
So can you imagine his anger...

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.980
at not being able
to make love to you now?

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:55.980
- I've seen it.
- You've seen it?

01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.060
As in, he raped you?

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:12.100
Rape is an act of anger.

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:15.180
It's about control,
not about sex.

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.220
Henry was a very angry man.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:22.660
Do you think he's guilty?

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.380
Do you?

01:18:32.140 --> 01:18:34.980
That night,
he visited your sister's home.

01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:38.260
Did you notice any scratches on him,
signs of struggle?

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:42.660
I can't remember.

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.100
I need to get my hands on the clothes
he was wearing that night.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.740
Please.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.060
Give me permission
to search your house.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.940
Because you saw your husband talking
to your niece on Christmas Eve...

01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.940
you've thrown him out of your bedroom
and haven't slept with him in two years.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.220
Now, don't you think
that's a little bit harsh?

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.620
Stop trying to bait me.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.940
What do you call a beautiful young woman
who's jealous of her 13-year-old niece?

01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.660
Honest.

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:17.740
'' Honest.'' I don't know
who's more fucked up, you or him.

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.220
I'm sorry.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:34.820
But don't you want to know
you've been right about him?

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.860
Don't you?

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.300
Don't make a mess.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:53.300
Castillo? Take a squad of men.
Escort Mrs. Hearst back to her house.

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.780
Yes, sir.

01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:00.020
- Castillo, search the house.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.460
Say it. Go on. Say it.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:08.660
She tells you about Camille,
everything falls into place.

01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:11.740
There's no need
to even ask my side of the story.

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:16.100
I'm Jack the Ripper,
Jekyll and Hyde, big, bad wolf.

01:20:16.140 --> 01:20:18.060
I'll remind you, Henry.

01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:23.060
I've heard your story all night,
and you've been lying.

01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:32.700
- Detective.
- You got a problem? Huh?

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:35.900
- All right.
- Let's go.

01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:40.420
Sit down, Henry.

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:41.300
Sit down, Henry.

01:20:45.700 --> 01:20:48.060
Going man to man now,
are we?

01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.300
Shall I roll up my sleeves?

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.220
Christmas. Two years ago.
You and Camille.

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:58.180
- Let me see.
- l don't get it.

01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.700
it was nothing,
absolutely nothing.

01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:05.420
Camille dragged me into her room to show
off a Christmas gift from her mother.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:09.420
- Even a knucklehead should be able to--
- She was high on a sugar rush...

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:11.060
from pumpkin pie.

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:14.100
This would look good on you.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.340
Couldn't keep still.

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.300
Smile.

01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:42.340
So Chantal overreacted?

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:47.700
Chantal never let you
touch her after that?

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:54.420
You know, there are many things
that separate couples:

01:21:57.700 --> 01:21:59.420
infidelity...

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:03.380
money, long illness.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.260
I'm separated from my wife
by a hallway, a 60-foot hallway.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:14.300
in fact, it's a desert,
that hallway.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.460
And at the very end,
there's a door.

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:23.060
And when it's locked,
you can knock all you want...

01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:25.540
but that door won’t open.

01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:28.820
Why do you hold on?
Why not just get a divorce?

01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:35.180
Just trade one nightmare
for another. Let's add it up:

01:22:35.260 --> 01:22:38.020
half my money, the house.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.100
I'd end up living
over somebody's reconverted garage.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.420
Oh, yeah, and then there's half
my share of the law firm.

01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:50.940
That's bullshit, Henry.
It's vanity, pure and simple.

01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.860
Being with her
puts you on everybody's A-list.

01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.700
You're Puerto Rico's glamour couple.

01:22:55.780 --> 01:23:00.900
''Ah! Henry and Chantal Hearst!
They're so in love!''

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:05.220
-Just full of compliments, aren't we?
- That's why you stay married.

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.780
At our age, finding another woman
like that's not so easy.

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.860
Not so easy
if you're taking them back...

01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:15.420
to your third-floor walk-up piece
of shit $500-a-month studio apartment.

01:23:15.460 --> 01:23:19.940
- Is that what you mean, Victor?
- Well, we can't all afford...

01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.780
to wine and dine classy, sophisticated
ladies we meet in La Perla, can we?

01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:29.020
Just who'd your wife find you with
before she relocated in such a hurry?

01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.260
Fuck you, Henry.

01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:38.260
Whoops.

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:54.020
Tell me.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.860
Sue Ellen Huddy.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:59.820
Did you know her well
or just in passing?

01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.820
Not well. Not at all.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:07.660
it’s impossible for a man my age
to know a 12-year-old really well.

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:10.820
To know a 12-year-old really well.

01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:24.500
Bags. Throw me the bags.
Thanks.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.620
The darkroom.

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:04.180
There was no dog in there.
There was only you.

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:10.580
We don't have any evidence
of a struggle...

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.980
so it had to be somebody
very good with children...

01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:15.380
or someone she knew.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.260
Did you kick the ball around
with her, Henry?

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.460
Did you laugh and play
with her first?

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.460
Or did you just take her?

01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.420
Was it as exciting
as Paulina Valera?

01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.500
- Tell me, Henry!
- Go to hell.

01:26:00.860 --> 01:26:02.900
You dressed her again.

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.500
You posed her.

01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:20.460
We'll find the brush, Henry.
We'll find the brush you used.

01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:24.740
We'll find the brush you used
to get her hair just right.

01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.220
And then what you came for:

01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:38.220
your trophy.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:10.140
You met Chantal when she was 11.

01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.900
You molded a pleasure model.

01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.020
Is that what you think
children are for? To pleasure you?

01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:32.260
You peel my onion
down to the nub.

01:27:35.740 --> 01:27:38.700
Are you trying to tell me
that you don't like them young?

01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:47.060
You're twice divorced,
single with a vengeance.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:50.420
Who do you talk to
in a martini bar?

01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:53.980
The best-looking girl
you can get away with, that's who.

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:57.940
And she's not 50.
Probably mid-30s.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:00.380
Of course, in their 20s-- Hey.

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:05.060
Now we're talking.
And how about teenage girls?

01:28:05.140 --> 01:28:09.740
We loved them then.
Why should anything change now?

01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:18.220
What does he possibly see
in a girl that young?

01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.100
What in the world
do they talk about?

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:29.420
If I want to discuss the S&P 500,
I'll call my broker.

01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:37.180
Young girls don't talk.
They laugh.

01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:39.900
They live.
They're in the moment.

01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.460
And every night is the night.

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:48.420
And their bodies
are hard and tight...

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:50.180
and smooth...

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:53.700
the way skin is supposed to be.

01:28:58.020 --> 01:28:59.860
And saying so...

01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:03.820
doesn't make me a pervert.

01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:15.100
Men can't say shit anymore.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.100
We're all browbeaten by youth-obsessed
old bitches fresh from chemical peels.

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.460
Still want us to open their doors,
pay their way.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:29.860
Yes, Victor,
I love young women.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.740
At least I'm honest enough
to say so.

01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:40.740
One-hundred
fucking percent guilty.

01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:43.020
Owens. We found them, sir.

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:49.500
- She come back with you?
- Yeah.

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.300
Put her in there.

01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:53.020
All right.

01:29:56.380 --> 01:30:00.020
All right, but only if you promise
to keep your mouth shut until I'm ready.

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.940
You're welcome.

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:11.020
You can sit right here.

01:30:14.900 --> 01:30:17.060
Check the recorder.
There should be enough tape...

01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:19.380
though I don't think
we'll need much more.

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.300
Have a seat, Henry.

01:30:30.820 --> 01:30:32.380
She's in there watching?

01:30:36.580 --> 01:30:38.500
What's he saying?

01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.340
You're good
at hiding behind things.

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:49.700
Sit down, Henry...

01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:53.260
and tell us one more time about your
relationship with these cond victim...

01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:55.660
Sue Ellen Huddy.

01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:04.860
Your relationship with
the murder victim, Sue Ellen Huddy--

01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:08.380
the little girl you claim
you found by the jogging path.

01:31:13.180 --> 01:31:15.180
She thinks that I did this.

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:18.100
I’ll ask the question one more time.

01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:26.020
What was your relationship
to the murdered girl, Sue Ellen Huddy?

01:31:33.900 --> 01:31:35.780
There was none.

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:40.020
None?

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:43.300
No. None.

01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:50.820
I saw her by the house
on occasion.

01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.340
She lived in the neighborhood.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:59.100
I might have spoke to her
once or twice...

01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:03.300
if ever.

01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:08.340
A greeting, per--

01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.860
perhaps.

01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:18.780
Here's what I believe,
Henry.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.340
You're bored.

01:32:25.380 --> 01:32:27.300
You're unhappy.

01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:29.620
You have a history
with very young girls.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.540
You've been placed at the scene
of the first murder.

01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:38.220
Your attempt at an alibi
was to kill a second young girl.

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:45.220
You're in love with someone
who doesn't love you...

01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:48.060
just who you were.

01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:52.540
You're very, very lonely.

01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:57.980
I'll tell you what I believe...

01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.220
what l know...

01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:03.860
what l have proof of.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:10.820
Can you tell me who that is?

01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:32.100
Sue Ellen.

01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.220
A portrait like that
takes time, Henry.

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:52.780
And this little girl?

01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:58.820
Chantal was nice enough
to bring these out of your darkroom.

01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.060
You make lovely photographs,
Henry.

01:34:14.980 --> 01:34:19.420
I can't believe that
she would go these lengths...

01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:25.260
to make this kind of point.

01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:32.540
It's almost farcical.

01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.660
You killed Sue Ellen Huddy.

01:34:56.740 --> 01:34:57.860
Yes.

01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.180
And Paulina Valera?

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:19.020
Yes.

01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:22.700
Both of them?

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:32.060
Yes, both of them.

01:35:33.860 --> 01:35:35.740
Raped and murdered them.

01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:39.420
I’m the one.

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:41.540
Are you prepared
to make a statement?

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:46.020
What else am I doing?

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:49.500
Well, let's--

01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:54.300
Let's begin with the first victim,
little Paulina.

01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:10.260
Take your time.

01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:14.180
I...

01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:21.780
saw her on the doorstep.

01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.220
Go on, Henry.
I'll be right back.

01:36:50.260 --> 01:36:52.580
You saw her on the doorstep.

01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:58.420
I saw her
on the doorstep, and...

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.700
she was all alone.

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.060
- And she went off with you?
- All right. What is it?

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:07.940
- These were in his car.
- You had sex with her?

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.420
Yes. l raped her.

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.860
- And then?
- And then strangled her.

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:18.700
There in the dump?

01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:23.660
- No. No, in the--
- Who is this?

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.620
- in an alley.
- We were too late.

01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:29.580
- Which alley, exactly?
- But we got him, sir.

01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:34.020
Park Central stakeout
caught him in the act.

01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.340
- l don't know.
- He's downstairs.

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.020
They are processing him now.

01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:42.860
So, afterwards...

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:45.260
you carried the body
to the dump?

01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:48.340
Sir, it's over.

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:49.820
Yeah, I dragged it.

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:56.660
Her clothes.
You'd already put them back on?

01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.220
l redressed her.

01:38:01.860 --> 01:38:04.820
And you posed her?

01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.940
Yes, I po--

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.260
Yes, l brushed her hair.

01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.300
l took her--

01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:24.780
l took her hands
and cupped them...

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:27.260
under her cheek.

01:38:29.060 --> 01:38:31.180
l opened her eyes and--

01:38:33.540 --> 01:38:35.060
and then...

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:38.020
I took her picture.

01:38:48.100 --> 01:38:50.060
What are you doing?

01:38:51.780 --> 01:38:53.580
You can go home, Henry.

01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:56.460
What?

01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:58.220
It's over.

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:03.300
They caught the killer.

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:17.980
What are you saying?

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.940
He's downstairs.

01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.380
What?
