WEBVTT

04:55.420 --> 04:57.004
Hey.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.717
You haven't changed. Please, take a seat.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.636
How is your sister?

06:28.472 --> 06:29.889
I have three sisters.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.641
The one with the big tits.
The one I always wanted to fuck.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.478
I hear good things, Latif.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.439
It says here you can shoot straight.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.567
Officer material, promoted already.
Lieutenant.

06:42.027 --> 06:44.236
Please, help yourself.

06:51.870 --> 06:52.912
Juice?

07:00.045 --> 07:02.671
I won't keep you guessing, Latif.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.381
I want you to come and work for me.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.510
- Work for you?
- Here, in Baghdad.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.345
Like old friends.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.348
- We were friends, weren't we, at school?
- Classmates.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.435
Didn't you once paint a picture
of my father?

07:16.520 --> 07:18.145
- You still have it?
- I gave it to you.

07:19.064 --> 07:22.358
I have an awful feeling
I told him I did it myself.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.278
Do you know who this is?

07:26.363 --> 07:28.239
- Of course.
- No, no, no.

07:28.323 --> 07:30.116
It is not who you think it is.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.076
His name is Faoaz al-Emari.

07:32.828 --> 07:35.996
Not Saddam. I see him all of the time.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.833
In the newspapers, in the magazines,
on television.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.710
Even I cannot tell who is who.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.046
It is not so unusual, Latif.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.758
Stalin had a double. He had dozens.
So did the Shah.

07:48.218 --> 07:49.218
The country is at war.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.387
My father cannot be expected
to be everywhere at once.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.224
Half the time there is no good reason,
but the people, they expect it.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.561
Add to that there is always the chance
some fucked-up Shi'a scum

07:58.645 --> 08:00.604
will take a shot at him.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.858
Look at yourself, Latif.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.277
Look. Look, look.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.404
Look at me.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.947
We could be twins, no?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.991
You are taller.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.076
How much? This much?

08:15.370 --> 08:18.038
Didn't they used to say
you looked like Uday Saddam Hussein?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.166
Didn't they used to say that at school?

08:21.501 --> 08:23.252
I want you, Latif.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.089
I want you to be my fidai.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.259
I want you to be my brother.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.429
Don't say anything.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.599
Take 10 minutes.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.683
Think it over.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.270
What happens if I say no?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.027
Ten minutes.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.336
He is shitting bricks.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.964
His grandfather was a Kurd. It's a pity.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.759
But the family's been in Baghdad
a long time.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.385
His father's done well.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.097
I believe he sells domestic appliances.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.934
He's never said a word against the party.

09:21.269 --> 09:25.564
Latif is the best we could find.
And we looked.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.650
Well, I have to have him.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.323
You will have whatever you want.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.743
Everything I own will belong to you.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.995
Uday,

09:41.164 --> 09:42.957
I am my father's son.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.670
I would give my last drop of blood for Iraq.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.716
But when this war is over,
I'm going to work in his business.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.262
I am the eldest son.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.891
I have brothers and sisters.
I have given them my word.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.978
- Sleep on it.
- Uday...

10:05.563 --> 10:07.481
You are asking me to

10:07.941 --> 10:09.608
extinguish myself.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.216
Thought it over?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.081
Please be clear about this, Latif.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.002
Uday has chosen you. You belong to him.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.964
You have about five minutes
to think about this

11:56.966 --> 12:00.552
before a car pulls up
outside your house in Al-Adhamiya

12:01.096 --> 12:02.971
and your family, every one of them,

12:03.681 --> 12:07.393
your father, your mother,
your sisters and brothers,

12:07.936 --> 12:09.978
is thrown into Abu Ghraib.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.316
God willing, they will die quickly.

12:15.610 --> 12:18.904
I've said too much.
You have about two minutes left.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.918
You'll have a cook and four maids.

12:33.044 --> 12:35.838
These pretty girls will get you
anything you feel like.

12:35.964 --> 12:39.591
Strawberries in winter, figs in July.
Just ask.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.886
But lay a finger on one of them
without prior permission

12:42.971 --> 12:45.514
and you'll never walk upright again.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.310
And these are Uday's rooms.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.856
He wants you to use them,
now that you are to be his brother.

12:54.649 --> 12:58.986
Leather sofas, Italian marble,
all designed by Gianfranco Giannelli.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.322
Handmade shoes, suits,

13:02.407 --> 13:05.492
Brioni, Versace, Armani, of course.

13:05.577 --> 13:10.289
Silk ties, watches. Breitling, Cartier, Rolex.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.082
Silk pajamas.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.544
These are very nice.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.254
Poor child never knows what to wear.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.131
He changes his mind every five minutes.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.924
Depends on what car he's driving.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.761
Honestly, habibi, that boy, he wears me out.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.473
You should probably clean yourself up.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.124
No calls.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.672
Incoming, yes. Outgoing, no.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.727
My name is Munem Hammed al-Tikriti.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.940
We're going to be seeing
a lot of each other.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.694
I write to my mother once a week.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.114
She's going to think that I got killed in Iran.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.824
Inshallah.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.785
Inshallah?

14:30.245 --> 14:31.620
My family are going to think that I'm dead.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.873
Let them think you died a martyr.

14:34.958 --> 14:37.668
I know it's difficult,
but it's what Uday wants.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.461
He will accept nothing less.

14:39.546 --> 14:43.382
She will be knocking on the door
of every hospital in Baghdad.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.427
When you say your prayers tonight,

14:47.512 --> 14:50.055
when you turn out the light
and close your eyes,

14:50.139 --> 14:52.724
this is what
you should be saying to yourself,

14:52.809 --> 14:56.228
"Latif Yahia is dead. He died in Iran.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.148
"May God have mercy on him.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.944
"Now I am Uday Saddam Hussein."

15:06.573 --> 15:08.323
Guten Tag.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.659
Take off your clothes, please.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.674
Cough.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.219
One more time.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.931
And one more time, please.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.188
Uday is three centimeters taller.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.107
We can use built-up shoes.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.579
Look at that. He is perfect.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.707
- Uday, this is boring.
- Shut up.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.044
How can you sit here all night
looking at yourself?

16:02.170 --> 16:04.921
- He looks great.
- He doesn't even look like you.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.173
What?

16:06.257 --> 16:08.008
His cock's too big.

16:13.348 --> 16:15.974
What do you mean, his cock is too big?

16:22.607 --> 16:25.150
Uday's life story. Learn it.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.332
Come on, come on, tell me.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.335
Shape of face, hair, nose, physique,
all in the high 90s.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.754
- Good.
- Your eyes are five millimeters bigger.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.465
- They can use make-up.
- And the teeth? What about the teeth?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.464
Two peas in a pod.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.844
- I was just trying the teeth.
- Smile. Go on, smile.

17:33.928 --> 17:36.179
No, no, no. Like this.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.227
And do the hair. Do the hair.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.105
You like the Rolex.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.440
Keep it.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.240
You look good in blue.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.618
Yes, it definitely suits you.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.542
Latif, hurry up.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.712
- There's too much ice.
- Can I say blue is your color?

18:08.796 --> 18:09.921
Shut up.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.121
I like the way you fight.

18:43.206 --> 18:44.206
You fight like me.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.000
He fights like me.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.882
I had a word with Dr. Linz.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.134
He says your cock's too big.

18:56.219 --> 18:58.845
We need to make a surgical reduction.

18:59.847 --> 19:02.557
- A what?
- Chop a bit off.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.768
- What?
- Not much.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.520
Just a teeny-weeny.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.522
Not much?

19:08.606 --> 19:12.067
My cock is well-known in Baghdad.
The women, they talk.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.821
I'm joking with you, you fuck.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.709
This is Said Kammuneh.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.754
He's a member
of the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.091
He has something to show you.

19:49.105 --> 19:53.692
This is from the personal collection
of Uday Saddam Hussein.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.670
That guy, he was a police officer.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.172
We were on the same football team.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.801
Great left foot. Good in the air.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.973
I shot this myself. Wait a minute.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.272
Good work, huh?

20:32.356 --> 20:35.692
We got a lot of this shit
from the East Germans and the Russians.

20:36.694 --> 20:39.362
See that guy? That's Rakti, the wrestler.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.656
He won a bronze medal in Moscow.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.492
The President calls him
the sharp sword of the Republic.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.538
You know that gas station
on Haifa Street by the lights?

20:48.623 --> 20:50.749
The President gave him that.

20:51.626 --> 20:54.127
The fat fuck's making 20 grand a month.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.671
That's good money.

21:00.593 --> 21:03.762
Look, I'll leave this with you.

21:20.529 --> 21:22.656
- Seen enough?
- Enough?

21:23.658 --> 21:25.825
Have I seen enough?

21:25.910 --> 21:29.079
I remember the day Saddam Hussein
became president of this country.

21:29.580 --> 21:32.791
I was still in short trousers.
We ran through the streets, shouting,

21:32.875 --> 21:36.378
"Saddam! Saddam Hussein!
Saddam Hussein!" Firing our guns.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.464
Even my father. Even my father.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.966
This stuff, Munem...

21:41.050 --> 21:43.385
These people...
I hope Said said something about this.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.679
They're criminals, deserters.

21:46.389 --> 21:49.099
Pornographers, counterfeiters,
murderers, of course.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.226
Putschists. Enemies of the Republic.

21:51.686 --> 21:54.980
Saddam Hussein built this country.
Never forget that.

21:55.064 --> 21:58.024
The schools, the roads, hospitals,
the mosques.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.777
He gave the Iraqi people
everything they want.

22:00.861 --> 22:03.530
He demands only one thing in return.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.533
Never raise a hand against his family.

22:07.284 --> 22:09.703
Do so and you will suffer.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.455
The people you love will suffer.

22:12.873 --> 22:16.626
Do well here, work hard
and you'll be one of the family.

22:21.424 --> 22:25.176
One day all this will be over. Inshallah.

22:25.803 --> 22:27.178
Inshallah?

22:28.597 --> 22:30.390
Only God knows when.

23:18.689 --> 23:20.774
Come, come, come, come, come.

23:38.501 --> 23:41.878
Munem disapproves. Look at him.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.423
He's angry with me.
He thinks I should leave you at home.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.969
- Who's this?
- Latif? He's my brother.

23:51.514 --> 23:55.850
Nobody must know this,
but Saddam, he has three sons.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.060
You tell anybody this,

23:57.144 --> 24:00.897
I will have to cut your tongue out
with a razor and feed it to the cat.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.444
Everything I own, I give to him.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.904
You don't own me.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.949
Sarrab, best fuck in Beirut.

24:18.332 --> 24:21.876
Loosen your tie. Let me do it for you.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.839
There. Isn't that better?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.886
Be careful what you say.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.389
I can read your mind.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.101
Are you really the President's son?

24:39.186 --> 24:41.354
You know what they say on TV.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.065
We are all the President's sons.

24:45.568 --> 24:49.362
Hey!

25:48.339 --> 25:50.381
Look at him.

25:50.466 --> 25:53.384
He can't keep his hands off that drag queen.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.433
Poor Uday.

26:00.517 --> 26:02.852
Sometimes I think he wants
to fuck himself to death.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.904
Will you excuse me a moment?

26:20.371 --> 26:21.496
Keys.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.415
Give me the keys.

26:27.670 --> 26:29.295
Give me the fucking keys!

26:30.089 --> 26:33.007
Baby, I so love your tits!

26:33.968 --> 26:36.511
I hope so, lover. You paid for them.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.661
What have you done with my brother?

28:02.431 --> 28:03.973
You see, Munem?

28:05.768 --> 28:09.520
Discipline. We must have discipline.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.690
If we do not have discipline,
we have no control.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.859
If we have no control, we have chaos.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.445
If we have chaos, we have disorder.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.415
You do understand, Latif? It is quite simple.

28:30.918 --> 28:32.919
We must have discipline.

28:34.630 --> 28:39.175
Got it?

28:41.303 --> 28:42.387
Good.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.275
Latif. Five minutes.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.174
Latif.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.375
- No, no, no!
- We must have discipline!

29:56.795 --> 29:59.547
Discipline! We must have discipline!

30:10.517 --> 30:11.726
How was that, Munem?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.562
Excellent.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.024
Sorry.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.245
Good.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.774
Empty your pockets.

31:49.283 --> 31:51.158
My grandfather,

31:51.493 --> 31:55.162
he talks to me the same way he did
when I was 10 years old.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.819
God is great.

32:28.322 --> 32:30.072
He gave me two sons.

32:31.366 --> 32:32.867
Now I have three.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.888
Make sure you give me no reason
to be angry with you.

32:59.186 --> 33:00.478
And?

33:08.403 --> 33:11.697
Uday, you owe me 50 dinar.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.532
50 dinar?

33:14.117 --> 33:15.159
You see?

33:15.243 --> 33:19.997
Trying to get money from your brother
is like trying to get blood from a stone.

33:22.834 --> 33:23.918
What?

33:26.546 --> 33:27.588
It's not him.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.049
What?

34:26.773 --> 34:29.483
It's your turn, brother.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.194
Fuck them. Fucking Kuwaitis.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.072
I hate them all.

34:36.158 --> 34:38.033
Worse than horseflies.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.333
My brothers, welcome to Baghdad.

35:39.846 --> 35:40.888
Fuck!

35:41.556 --> 35:44.266
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

35:44.351 --> 35:45.559
Fucking Kuwaitis!

35:45.644 --> 35:47.478
I fucking hate Jews, I hate horseflies

35:47.562 --> 35:48.979
and I hate fucking Persians,

35:49.064 --> 35:51.565
but I hate fucking Kuwaitis more!

35:51.650 --> 35:53.067
They insult us.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.654
They are filth. They maul our women.

35:56.738 --> 35:59.573
The Kuwaitis have been
stealing $280 million a year

36:00.534 --> 36:02.243
from the oilfields at Rumaila.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.830
$280 million a year!

36:07.165 --> 36:08.958
You know we traced the weapon.

36:09.042 --> 36:12.253
I just know the fucking Kuwaitis
are behind this!

36:12.337 --> 36:13.671
I hope my father wipes them out.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.132
No, I'm telling you this.
I don't care who knows it!

36:17.217 --> 36:20.052
The age of the sheikhs is over. Over!

36:21.596 --> 36:23.931
- What?
- It's me, habibi.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.601
What are you doing right now?

36:27.686 --> 36:32.064
I'm getting my nails done. Nice and sharp.

36:32.148 --> 36:34.024
The better to scratch you with.

36:35.110 --> 36:38.612
Did I ever tell you
how much I love your ass?

36:38.697 --> 36:42.616
It's the best ass in Baghdad.
I'll see you soon.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.702
Hey, you, you!

36:45.453 --> 36:47.121
You'll meet many women.

36:47.998 --> 36:51.208
Whores, wealthy women from Al Mansour

36:51.293 --> 36:54.420
who come looking for a favor
and offer you favors in return.

36:54.504 --> 36:57.339
Schoolgirls he snatches off the street.

36:58.258 --> 37:01.427
- You'll be given your fair share.
- Ready, guys?

37:01.511 --> 37:05.806
Never even speak to a woman
Uday has chosen for himself.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.270
He is insane.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.774
You know it, Munem.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.067
He's insane.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.155
You turn a blind eye. You have no choice.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.324
I understand that.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.619
You are a good man in a bad job.

37:27.704 --> 37:28.829
Look at him.

37:30.665 --> 37:31.707
He's psychotic.

37:31.791 --> 37:34.710
Come on, kiss. Kiss more. More. Kiss, kiss.

37:36.171 --> 37:38.088
Who wants to sleep with me tonight? You?

38:07.369 --> 38:09.662
Through the window
of a British worker's flat,

38:09.746 --> 38:11.538
the Battle of Kuwait unfolds.

38:13.625 --> 38:17.211
Saddam Hussein, very simply,
you cannot bully your neighbor.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.838
You cannot wipe him out,
a member of the Arab League,

38:19.923 --> 38:21.298
a member of the United Nations.

38:22.550 --> 38:27.304
Saddam Hussein!
The hero of the Battle of Qadisiyyah.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.890
The knight of the Arab nations.

38:29.975 --> 38:33.143
Direct descendant of the prophet.

38:33.228 --> 38:35.187
Saddam the noble fighter.

38:35.981 --> 38:39.650
Scion of the family of Imam al-Hussein.

38:39.734 --> 38:44.571
Ladies and gentlemen,
Uday Saddam Hussein.

39:00.755 --> 39:04.675
The age of the sheikhs is over!

39:07.262 --> 39:10.014
With the help of Almighty God,

39:10.098 --> 39:12.599
Kuwait has come home!

40:13.578 --> 40:17.206
Hey, you. The teeth. You with the teeth.

40:17.457 --> 40:20.042
Come on. I'll give you a ride.

40:20.126 --> 40:24.004
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! You!
No, no, no, no. You, you, you.

40:28.635 --> 40:29.718
Hey, you.

40:30.845 --> 40:32.971
Don't be scared. Come for a ride.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.226
Come on, get in the car.
I'll give you a lift home.

40:37.310 --> 40:39.019
I'll take you back.

40:41.689 --> 40:45.317
Hey, don't be scared.
Why do you run? Why do you run?

40:45.401 --> 40:47.611
Come on. Why are you running?
I'll take you home.

40:49.489 --> 40:50.531
Come on.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.492
Hey. How about you?

40:55.537 --> 40:56.870
I love what you've done with your hair.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.044
Hey, hey, hey!

41:04.629 --> 41:07.631
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.134
It's all right.

41:10.218 --> 41:14.054
You're beautiful. Don't be scared.
I'm not going to hurt you.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.890
Brother, she's beautiful. You want her?

41:18.143 --> 41:20.018
- Take.
- No!

41:20.103 --> 41:23.647
What? What?
Don't fucking look at me like that.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.315
- Like what?
- Like that.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.776
I know that fucking look.
I know what you're thinking.

41:27.861 --> 41:30.154
Think what the fuck you like.
I like cunt. I want cunt.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.030
I see a cunt, I want to fuck it. I don't care.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.366
I love my country,
I love my mother, my father.

41:34.450 --> 41:37.077
But I love cunt more than I love God!

42:35.678 --> 42:38.138
Does her mama know that she's out?

42:49.317 --> 42:51.318
You know this man?

42:52.862 --> 42:54.655
This is Kamel Hannah.

42:55.365 --> 42:58.033
He's my father's greatest friend.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.826
He tastes his food.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.538
Did she get a note from her teacher?

43:10.338 --> 43:11.380
See this watch?

43:11.756 --> 43:12.923
You see this watch?

43:13.007 --> 43:14.591
How much you think a watch like this costs?

43:14.676 --> 43:17.761
How much? How much you think
a watch like this costs? $10,000.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.640
It's a $10,000 watch.
My father bought him that watch.

43:21.724 --> 43:26.061
Why? Why did my father buy Kamel Hannah
a watch like this?

43:26.145 --> 43:27.771
Shall I tell you why? Shall I tell you why?

43:27.855 --> 43:30.315
Shall I tell you why my father
loves Kamel Hannah so much?

43:30.400 --> 43:33.527
- Because he gets his whores for him.
- Rubbish.

43:35.196 --> 43:38.323
Our mother... Our mother
sits around the house and weeps

43:38.408 --> 43:41.535
because of the whores
this man brings my father.

43:43.204 --> 43:45.706
She wanders, she walks around the palace,

43:45.832 --> 43:47.332
walks around the palace,
staring in the mirrors,

43:47.417 --> 43:49.710
staring in the mirrors,
looking at herself like a fucking zombie

43:49.794 --> 43:53.213
because of the whores
this man brings my father!

43:56.676 --> 43:58.218
- Shall I kill him, brother?
- Uday.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.059
What do you think, brother?

44:06.144 --> 44:08.061
What do you think? Shall I kill him?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.147
Kill your father's greatest friend?

44:10.231 --> 44:13.900
He is a twittering little pimp
that has driven my mother mad.

44:15.111 --> 44:17.904
- Maybe I'll let you kill him for me.
- Uday.

44:18.406 --> 44:20.073
No.

44:21.034 --> 44:24.161
I don't know him. It's meaningless.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.705
If I am going to kill somebody,
I want to know why I'm going to do it.

44:31.502 --> 44:36.298
Uday.

44:38.176 --> 44:40.927
- You fucker!
- Easy, easy.

44:44.057 --> 44:45.932
You should be ashamed of your...

44:48.144 --> 44:49.603
Motherfucker.

44:51.981 --> 44:54.232
Come into my bedroom. Come on.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.402
Would you like a drink? A nice drink?

44:58.279 --> 45:00.197
I like to drink whiskey.

45:01.616 --> 45:03.658
Take it, here, here.

45:12.960 --> 45:15.712
Would you like some?
Would you like some?

45:20.301 --> 45:23.220
That's it. In just one. In one. In one.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.146
You're very beautiful.
You're a very beautiful girl.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.733
Beg me... Beg me to fuck you.

45:36.818 --> 45:39.736
Beg me. Go on, beg me to fuck you.

45:41.239 --> 45:42.823
He humiliate me.

45:49.372 --> 45:53.834
Why not? Just say it.
Beg me. Beg me to fuck you.

45:53.918 --> 45:56.086
- I can't.
- Come on.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.921
- I...
- Yes?

45:58.005 --> 46:01.133
...beg...
...beg...

46:01.217 --> 46:03.176
...you... I can't.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.137
- Go on.
- No.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.687
- Beg me. Beg me.
- No.

46:16.566 --> 46:19.359
Beg me! Beg me to fuck you.

46:20.194 --> 46:25.490
Beg me to fuck you.

46:26.742 --> 46:30.036
Beg me to fuck you! Beg me!

46:30.413 --> 46:32.998
- Beg! Beg! Beg!
- I beg...

46:35.668 --> 46:38.378
Yassem! Yassem!

46:39.547 --> 46:42.382
- Who's doing that?
- That pig, Kamel Hannah. He won't stop.

46:44.051 --> 46:45.886
He says he doesn't take orders
from faggots.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.197
Stop!

47:06.073 --> 47:08.408
- Fuck you.
- I order you to stop!

47:08.493 --> 47:12.162
I don't take orders from you!
I take orders from Saddam Hussein.

47:35.311 --> 47:36.353
Uday, Uday...

47:38.898 --> 47:40.106
No! No!

47:47.490 --> 47:49.449
Boss, come on. Let's go.

47:56.666 --> 47:57.999
Just get her out of here, okay?

49:28.382 --> 49:30.592
He took pills, sleeping pills.

50:00.498 --> 50:02.082
Give me the knife.

50:12.176 --> 50:14.260
You'll kill him.

50:14.387 --> 50:16.346
The loss of blood and...

50:47.837 --> 50:50.296
I should have gelded him at birth.

52:02.495 --> 52:06.623
At 7:00 tonight the armed forces
of the United States began an operation

52:06.707 --> 52:08.333
at the direction of the President

52:08.709 --> 52:12.295
to force Saddam Hussein
to withdraw his troops from Kuwait

52:12.379 --> 52:15.298
and to end his occupation of their country.

52:27.561 --> 52:29.771
That's the latest Tomahawk cruise missile

52:29.855 --> 52:31.815
to fly just over our position here.

52:32.107 --> 52:35.235
Anti-aircraft gunners all around
have been trying to shoot them down.

52:37.738 --> 52:40.490
I have said to the people of Iraq

52:40.574 --> 52:42.909
that our quarrel was not with them,

52:43.911 --> 52:46.246
but instead with their leadership

52:46.330 --> 52:48.748
and above all with Saddam Hussein.

53:06.433 --> 53:09.394
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.

53:09.478 --> 53:11.604
Millions of dollars a year.

53:12.439 --> 53:14.482
Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars.

53:14.608 --> 53:19.028
Kuwait has been stealing our oil.
Millions of dollars a year.

53:19.113 --> 53:23.032
From the oilfields.
From our oilfields at Rumaila.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.034
Kuwait.

53:26.829 --> 53:28.413
Kuwait, Kuwait.

53:28.497 --> 53:31.124
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!

53:31.208 --> 53:34.294
Millions of dollars a year
from our oilfields at Rumaila.

53:34.378 --> 53:36.838
Our country is losing
more than a billion dollars a year!

53:39.133 --> 53:40.508
Take the glasses off.

53:40.593 --> 53:42.135
What are you doing here?

53:42.219 --> 53:45.096
- How did you get in?
- Do you want me to go?

53:47.516 --> 53:51.185
Why are you wearing Ray-Bans
at 1:00 in the morning?

53:51.270 --> 53:52.729
Take them off.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.649
- I want to be sure it's you.
- Are you sure?

53:57.693 --> 53:58.902
I can always tell.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.029
You cannot stay here.

54:01.989 --> 54:03.740
Have you seen what's going on outside?

54:06.035 --> 54:09.787
Hear what Saddam said on television?
"The mother of all battles."

54:11.040 --> 54:14.626
Iraqi people are not stupid.
Nobody believes that crap.

54:16.545 --> 54:20.673
Iraq is going to burn to the ground.
We won't see that on TV.

54:23.427 --> 54:25.845
And Uday? Is he reporting for duty?

54:26.472 --> 54:30.099
No. Uday has gone to bed
with a splitting headache

54:30.184 --> 54:34.354
because Yassem Al-Helou forgot
to press his tweed hunting breeches.

54:35.356 --> 54:38.316
He's a child. He'll tire of you.

54:39.109 --> 54:41.027
He tires of everything.

54:41.737 --> 54:44.197
One day soon, he'll tire of me

54:44.281 --> 54:47.825
and I'll end up
at the bottom of the lake with the fish.

54:54.375 --> 54:58.628
Today he's infatuated with you.
He's quite dazzled.

54:58.712 --> 55:02.632
He thinks he made you up,
just like that, out of the dust.

55:02.716 --> 55:05.802
Tomorrow he snaps his fingers
and you vanish.

55:05.886 --> 55:08.096
But you can leave, Sarrab.

55:08.180 --> 55:10.390
If I run away, he'll find me.

55:11.767 --> 55:14.602
If he can't find me, he'll find my sister.

55:16.063 --> 55:19.691
Who's going to protect me
from Uday Hussein? You?

55:22.444 --> 55:24.696
This is the way it is in Iraq.

55:32.746 --> 55:33.997
It's him.

55:41.755 --> 55:42.922
Latif?

55:44.425 --> 55:45.842
I cannot sleep.

55:47.011 --> 55:48.094
Take a pill.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.692
You may kiss me now.

58:28.005 --> 58:30.214
You must go to Basra, my son.

58:44.646 --> 58:46.814
- What did he say?
- It's not him.

58:46.899 --> 58:49.692
- Of course it's him.
- You don't know your own father?

58:49.776 --> 58:52.236
- It wasn't him.
- Of course I do. What did he say?

58:52.321 --> 58:53.613
Basra.

58:54.198 --> 58:55.448
Basra?

58:56.783 --> 58:58.659
Fuck Basra.

58:58.744 --> 59:00.620
Don't expect me to go.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:16.779
Kuwait has stolen our Iraqi oil!

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:22.034
Millions of dollars a year
from the oilfields at Rumaila!

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:26.163
Our country is losing
more than a billion dollars a year!

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:30.710
What is Kuwait?
Who made up this country?

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.170
The thieving British!

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:40.219
In 1935 they picked up a pen
and drew a line in the sand.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.639
Kuwait is a fantasy!

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:48.019
- Look, Mother. It's me.
- Kuwait is a lie!

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:52.898
Kuwait is the province of Iraq!

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.001
The age of the sheikhs is over!

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:22.178
- Qusay?
- Uday.

01:01:22.262 --> 01:01:24.930
- Are you watching?
- He didn't fool me, my brother.

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:28.100
You can tell? How?

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:32.688
For one thing he's sober, and second
he's not foaming at the mouth.

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:38.337
It's a hit!

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.840
- Let's go!
- Go! Go! Go!

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:16.375
You've lost a lot of blood.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:18.711
We might have to lose the little finger.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.257
Who's going to tell Uday?

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.302
Take more. Take more.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.679
Monsieur.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:30.931
What? What?

01:03:31.016 --> 01:03:35.561
The little finger. Right hand.
They're doing their best.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.605
Fuck!

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:05.216
Is it you?

01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:08.427
It's me.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.685
The Americans are saying
Uday has been shot by the Shi'a.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:22.733
But I know Uday is in Geneva,
gambling with his uncle.

01:04:23.944 --> 01:04:25.194
He called me last night.

01:04:26.947 --> 01:04:29.073
Yes, it is you.

01:05:26.006 --> 01:05:28.757
- Where's Latif? Latif, with the finger?
- I'm busy. People are dying.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:32.177
People are dying! People are dying!
People are fucking dying!

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.889
I know people are dying!
I know they are dying!

01:05:36.016 --> 01:05:39.685
Men, women, Iraqi soldiers losing arms
and fucking legs. Brave people.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:43.230
I don't give a fuck! Do you understand me?

01:05:43.315 --> 01:05:45.774
Do you understand me? Fuck them!

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:47.985
- I don't give a fuck!
- You must go. Now.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.612
Go, go, go, go. You must go.

01:05:55.869 --> 01:05:57.703
Save his finger.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:02.416
If you fail to save this man's finger,

01:06:03.335 --> 01:06:05.544
I will kill every one of you.

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:19.141
Iraq's army is defeated.
Our military objectives are met.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.810
Kuwait is once more
in the hands of Kuwaitis,

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:24.229
in control of their own destiny.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.480
Oh, my God. Look at that.

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:10.109
I could fuck that. I could really fuck that.
Could you fuck that?

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.276
Yassem.

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:17.324
I wonder if she's a virgin.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.868
Do you think she's a virgin?

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:24.123
It's her wedding day. It is the best day
of her life. She is the man's bride.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:27.334
Do you think she'll let me
stick my finger up her ass?

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.505
You think?

01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:33.382
Come over. Come on.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.801
Come.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.970
I do like that dress.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.388
Come here, darling.

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:42.975
You're beautiful, very, very beautiful.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.686
You having a nice day?
Come, let me kiss you.

01:07:47.188 --> 01:07:49.523
Very good. My brother.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:05.890
Nothing serious.
As you can see, rumors of my death

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.559
- are scandalous lies...
- It's me.

01:09:07.644 --> 01:09:09.269
...put out by the Americans.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:13.732
Scandalous lies that insult
the intelligence of the Iraqi people.

01:09:20.615 --> 01:09:21.698
Allahu akbar.

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.618
Allahu akbar?

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:27.287
Allah gives me nothing.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.791
Everything I want I just take for myself.

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.602
Look at me.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.770
I'm a fucking war hero.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:41.445
Well, she's dead.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:46.408
Find out who she is. Send them some
dinars for the damage. Are you deaf?

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:51.455
I said pick up the phone,
get hold of Said at the Olympic Committee.

01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.415
- Do what I tell you.
- Do it yourself!

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:56.126
What? What did you say?

01:10:56.210 --> 01:11:00.047
I said do it yourself.
I will not be part of this madness.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:21.151
I will never let you go.
I will never let you go.

01:11:25.156 --> 01:11:26.907
I love you too much.

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:31.912
Yassem.

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:51.098
I should have put a bullet in his head.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:55.394
Then you would be just like him.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:56.895
And you're not.

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:59.648
Praise God for that.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:01.358
You're my Latif.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.333
- You must go.
- No, he's gone. He's gone.

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.086
I know, but he'll be back. You must go.

01:12:27.135 --> 01:12:30.762
How can you stand it?
Why do you choose to live like this?

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.433
I didn't choose.

01:12:34.517 --> 01:12:36.935
He chose me, just like he chose you.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.505
You have a visitor.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.307
I want you to do something for me.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:35.827
I will look into this complaint.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:38.497
If need be, I will talk to my father.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:42.375
I'm a tired man.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.961
I have a heart condition.

01:13:45.046 --> 01:13:48.173
Look into my eyes. Look deep.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:51.635
Can you see the pain there?

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:54.763
This is the pain you give
to the people of Iraq.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:57.390
Pain that never ends.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.523
Today I have come to seek justice.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.983
Will I be shown any compassion?

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:09.569
Justice. Compassion.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.239
Fuck this!

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:17.911
Is this him?

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:22.541
Your daughter was a whore. She enjoyed it.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:26.378
She was 14 years old.
No man has ever touched her.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:29.131
God gave her beauty.
This was her downfall.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:32.300
This is too much. You are a criminal.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.595
- All of Iraq knows your crimes.
- You are a good man.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.808
Give him 1,000 dinars for her time.
That is good money for a whore.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.978
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:45.313
I'll put a fucking bullet
in your fucking head!

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.899
You, you, put a bullet in his head now.
Now!

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.860
- What has he done?
- What has he done?

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:52.821
- He's a man who has lost his daughter.
- You heard what he said about you?

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:55.407
- About me?
- About you, Uday Saddam Hussein.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:57.117
It was not me who snatched her
off the street.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.662
I didn't beat her.
If you want to kill him, kill him yourself.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:03.081
You think you can pick and choose?
You think you can pick and choose?

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:05.333
You are nothing!
Without me, you'd be hanging

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:07.085
from a fucking lamppost on Haifa Street.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.505
I made you, Latif. I made you.
I gave you life.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:13.216
If I want, I'll fucking take it away.
Now put a bullet in his head.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:17.762
I'm not going to kill this man.
Kill me if you want.

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:21.391
- I don't care.
- You would die to save this man?

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:23.810
Go on, what are you waiting for?
Kill me. Put a bullet in my head.

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:26.146
You're going to do it one of these nights
when the mood takes you.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.939
Why not now?
Go on, put a bullet in my head.

01:15:28.274 --> 01:15:30.609
Never. I love you too much.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.904
No.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.947
You love Uday.

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:40.535
You are not afraid to die?

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:41.953
You forget.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.915
I died the day I came here.

01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:47.125
You do not fear God.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:51.171
Let me make this easy for you.

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:58.720
I don't believe it.
Somebody get this on tape.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.222
Yassem! Come film this.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:02.432
- This is better than a porno movie!
- Get me the hospital.

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:05.727
- Get out of my way.
- Yassem, film this. Film this.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:11.024
Yassem! Yassem!

01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:12.734
Yassem!

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:14.819
Get help.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:27.165
He's the last person I'd be going out with.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.918
- But he's my best friend.
- Well, you go out with him, then.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:32.671
- Go out with who?
- Nobody, Baba.

01:16:33.381 --> 01:16:35.048
Am I missing something here?

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.009
- I'll get it.
- Yes, Baba.

01:16:38.094 --> 01:16:39.886
Gallalha's getting married next week.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:42.055
Is she? That's good.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.015
Makes life much easier for me.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:45.809
Baba!

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.519
It's Latif!

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:19.652
Ju'an, run along, habibi.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:27.535
Uday Saddam Hussein
invites you to a party.

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.956
His birthday.

01:18:32.124 --> 01:18:34.125
He is never going to stop.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:35.627
Son,

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:38.797
I don't want to know what you've done.

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:44.302
I want you to know
that I absolutely trust you.

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:48.598
And I am proud of you.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.309
One day, when God wills it,

01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:53.144
we'll have justice.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:18:58.650
You must go.

01:19:00.569 --> 01:19:02.904
You must leave this country,
go as far away as you can,

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:06.366
and don't come back
until Uday Hussein is dead and buried.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.576
He will come looking for me.

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:14.124
He will come here. You know that.
He will come looking for you.

01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:19.712
Go to this party, drink his whiskey.
We must look for the right moment.

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:24.551
- Don't ask me to do this.
- Latif, I am an old man.

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:28.471
My life is here.
Everything I have made of my life.

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:32.642
God gave me life, my son.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.687
When he wills it, he'll take it away.

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.857
You will do as you are told.

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:04.257
You.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:07.635
You, you, in the blue dress.
In the blue dress.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:11.723
Get it off. Get it off, all of it.
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.476
Go on, take, take, take.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:17.270
All of you, all of you. You, in the gold.

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:22.066
Give me... Take off your dress.
Take off your dress!

01:20:23.694 --> 01:20:26.738
It's Uday's birthday party for my friends

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:29.908
and I want to see all of you naked,
all of you!

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:33.244
Come on! Come on, naked.
More. Blue clothing. Take it off!

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:35.455
Now, off. All of it. Take your knickers off.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.749
Beautiful ass. Beautiful ass.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.878
Come on! Take it off!
This is birthday celebration!

01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:02.398
Good, good, good. I like it.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.651
And you. Don't hide yourself.
Let me see you.

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:13.326
You're beautiful. You're beautiful.
You should show yourself.

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:17.038
It is a lot of beautiful people
for my birthday.

01:21:21.168 --> 01:21:23.169
- That Mercedes...
- It's not for sale.

01:21:23.254 --> 01:21:24.712
I heard you'd take 30,000.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.673
There are two things I never do, Said.

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:29.509
I never pass wind in the presence
of the President of the Republic

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.386
and I never do business with pimps like you.

01:21:42.356 --> 01:21:45.608
Latif! Latif!

01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:46.985
God is great.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.362
He gives my brother back to me.

01:21:58.414 --> 01:22:00.832
- You didn't?
- I did. Come.

01:22:01.292 --> 01:22:03.001
Come, come, come, come, come.

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.961
I quite enjoyed it.

01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:08.006
It hurt like hell.
I thought I would need stitches.

01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:10.258
What is Sarrab going to say?

01:22:13.429 --> 01:22:15.013
Sarrab?

01:22:16.682 --> 01:22:18.850
What is Sarrab going to say?

01:22:18.934 --> 01:22:21.185
Why the fuck should you care
what Sarrab is going to say?

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:26.524
Look at him.
Latif thinks because he looks like me,

01:22:26.609 --> 01:22:28.860
he dresses like me, he sleeps in my bed,

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:30.570
he thinks he can fuck like me.

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:32.530
You think you can fuck my women?

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:34.240
He's jealous.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.368
He wants to fuck you himself.

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:40.663
You know what this fucking Kurd
said to me?

01:22:41.373 --> 01:22:43.625
I offered him 30,000 dinars
for that Mercedes.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.586
He said he wouldn't sell it to a pimp.

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:49.130
Pimp? You called this gentleman a pimp?

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:51.299
- Gentleman?
- He called you a pimp?

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:53.343
- Uday's.
- Uday's pimp? Uday's pimp?

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.803
- You called this man Uday's pimp?
- He's lying.

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:57.180
This man is my friend.

01:22:57.598 --> 01:22:59.891
He is one of this country's
most successful businessmen.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:01.684
Businessmen?

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.978
What business is that? Cunt?

01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:05.897
- Sit down.
- I'm leaving.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:09.067
- Sit down.
- Are you leaving? No?

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.318
I am leaving.

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:11.986
Sit down. I'm talking to you.

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.031
What do you want from me, Uday?

01:23:15.366 --> 01:23:20.078
You belong to me, Latif.
You do as I say. Sit down.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.579
You are going to have to shoot me
in the back.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:22.830
Stop!

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:25.833
Stop! I order you to stop!

01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:42.975
Fuck!

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:45.687
Take me with you.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.981
You can't leave me here.

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:07.625
Kill him. He'd kill you.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.130
I am not Uday.

01:24:13.257 --> 01:24:14.757
Come on.

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:19.971
Keys.

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:32.650
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:37.447
You let him go.

01:24:38.157 --> 01:24:40.408
He had a gun.

01:24:40.492 --> 01:24:42.577
You had a gun.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:43.995
He took it.

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:48.518
Fuck.

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:55.316
Second thoughts?

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:59.946
I should've put you out back there.
Would've been the smart thing to do.

01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:03.449
- That's what Uday would have done.
- Not so smart.

01:26:03.534 --> 01:26:05.868
Uday would have killed me first.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:08.830
- Do you have any money?
- No.

01:26:08.914 --> 01:26:11.415
- Nothing?
- I'm not a prostitute.

01:26:13.377 --> 01:26:14.585
Too bad.

01:27:33.332 --> 01:27:34.498
Do you ride?

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:54.101
Well, what does it say?
What does it say, Munem?

01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:56.979
Uday Saddam Hussein has fled Iraq.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.233
Sit down.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:05.363
Who is this woman?

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:10.826
Some whore he met.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:27.051
Uday will make an appearance
on the news at 1:00.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.137
They're on their way here now.

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:34.350
She has no shoes on her feet.

01:28:39.898 --> 01:28:42.733
This is what happens.

01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:46.153
You give people an opportunity,

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:49.281
lift them up, let them eat at your table,

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:51.784
sleep in your bed.

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:57.415
And this is how they repay you.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:40.708
Who is this?

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:43.794
I'm sitting here watching Ali
fuck your sister up the ass.

01:29:45.630 --> 01:29:47.256
I'm not joking with you, Latif.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:50.801
Come back to Baghdad.

01:29:50.886 --> 01:29:53.471
We can smoke a pipe together.

01:29:53.555 --> 01:29:56.891
Fuck some women, drive some cars.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:30:00.644
Don't tell me you need time to think.
Don't keep me waiting, brother.

01:30:02.981 --> 01:30:04.315
Don't force my hand.

01:30:06.234 --> 01:30:07.860
Come back, Latif.

01:30:08.987 --> 01:30:11.238
I miss you.

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.657
I've got no one here to talk to.

01:30:15.577 --> 01:30:17.328
Think of your mother and your father.

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:22.833
How did he get this number?

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.670
We just walked through the door.

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:28.923
Uday knows everybody.

01:30:29.007 --> 01:30:31.801
These people in Malta
have a lot of business in Baghdad.

01:30:31.885 --> 01:30:33.594
Half the people I know have money here.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:34.929
They come to get their tits done.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.723
We've got to get out of here.
We cannot stay here.

01:30:40.602 --> 01:30:42.937
We walk through the door
and he's on the phone.

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.356
He will never leave us alone.
I know him, he's a fanatic.

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.690
He will never stop.
You're not listening to me!

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.651
Stop shouting at me!

01:30:58.662 --> 01:31:00.204
I have a child.

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:05.376
A little girl.

01:31:06.044 --> 01:31:07.169
Tara.

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:11.841
Nobody knows this, not even Uday.

01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:15.553
She's with my sister in Samarra.

01:31:17.139 --> 01:31:18.889
You have to help me.

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:22.643
You have to do something, Latif.
She's three years old.

01:31:22.727 --> 01:31:24.228
I can't leave my daughter in Iraq.

01:31:25.814 --> 01:31:27.606
You tell me this now?

01:31:28.775 --> 01:31:30.985
I was too frightened.

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:34.572
- I didn't know what you'd do.
- This is insane.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:36.115
You are insane.

01:31:36.283 --> 01:31:40.661
- What kind of a woman are you?
- There's nothing else, wallahi, I swear it.

01:31:40.829 --> 01:31:42.955
What do you expect me to do?

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:46.417
Who is the father?

01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:48.752
Talk to him.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:53.257
Do you even know who the father is?

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:59.305
Now that's Uday talking. I can hear it.

01:32:01.933 --> 01:32:03.267
He's dead.

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.396
I spoke to my sister.

01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:34.984
She knows a man who can drive
Tara to Amman. He wants US dollars.

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:39.571
It was you.

01:33:41.074 --> 01:33:42.700
What do you mean?

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:49.039
How else did Uday know where I was?
There is no other way.

01:33:55.046 --> 01:33:57.548
You never say anything nice, do you?

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:01.719
You never say I look pretty.

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:04.888
You never ask me how I'm feeling.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:08.517
You never tell me you love me.

01:34:11.688 --> 01:34:13.939
When you make love to me,

01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.817
you're tender.

01:34:16.901 --> 01:34:18.235
Only then.

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:25.576
Look at me, Latif.

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:30.414
Look at me.

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:32.791
What do you see?

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:35.502
Uday's whore?

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:39.715
- Is that what I am to you?
- I spoke to the operator.

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:45.804
He gave me a list of outgoing calls.

01:34:49.726 --> 01:34:51.727
I didn't call the Iraqi Embassy three times.

01:34:53.313 --> 01:34:55.647
It wasn't me
who called the Iraqi Olympic Committee.

01:34:55.732 --> 01:34:57.358
I got scared.

01:34:58.568 --> 01:35:00.527
I was calling my sister.

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:05.032
- I was scared for my daughter.
- It was you, Sarrab.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:07.618
You.

01:35:10.246 --> 01:35:13.999
You called Uday. You told him where I was.

01:35:14.084 --> 01:35:15.459
It was you.

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:22.716
Take what you want, Sarrab.

01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:26.595
There is money in the hotel room.

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:38.565
My poor Latif.

01:36:50.388 --> 01:36:52.014
And how is Sarrab?

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:56.226
Did she tell you about her daughter
living with her sister?

01:36:57.687 --> 01:37:00.314
And you believed her.

01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:02.941
Don't hang up the phone, motherfucker.
I have your father in my office.

01:37:05.403 --> 01:37:06.862
Let me speak to him.

01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:08.822
Come home, Latif.

01:37:10.366 --> 01:37:12.159
Think of your father.

01:37:12.577 --> 01:37:14.369
Come back to Baghdad.

01:37:16.498 --> 01:37:17.748
I'm going to put your father on the phone.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:21.210
I want you to listen
to what he has to say to you.

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:23.754
He's going to tell you what to do.

01:37:25.507 --> 01:37:26.965
Here.

01:37:27.717 --> 01:37:29.384
Speak to your son.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:36.934
Are you well, my son?

01:37:37.727 --> 01:37:42.064
Yes, I'm fine. Listen, I have a plan.

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:46.777
I'm going to say this once,
and it's my final word.

01:37:49.239 --> 01:37:54.284
You will do as I tell you
or you are no longer my son.

01:37:58.039 --> 01:38:02.376
Tell this evil son of a bitch

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:03.961
to go to hell.

01:38:09.342 --> 01:38:10.968
Speak up, Latif.

01:38:12.971 --> 01:38:14.054
What is it to be?

01:38:21.187 --> 01:38:22.229
Go to hell.

01:39:10.361 --> 01:39:12.362
Latif Yahia.

01:39:21.247 --> 01:39:24.458
They took my father
to Uday's office that morning.

01:39:26.294 --> 01:39:29.546
They dropped his body off
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:35.552
My mother was forbidden
to give him a decent burial.

01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:40.849
She was told to bury him in the garden.

01:39:44.646 --> 01:39:48.565
Nothing will bring my wife back.
Or your father.

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:55.405
Why have you come here?

01:39:56.741 --> 01:39:58.367
What do you want?

01:40:39.325 --> 01:40:41.660
Hey, girls! Girls!

01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:43.704
You, come and talk to me.

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:57.300
Hey, you. Come here.
Come. I'll take you home.

01:40:57.385 --> 01:41:00.804
With the pretty hair.
You're very pretty. No, you are.

01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:05.392
Please, come on. Where are you from?

01:41:15.319 --> 01:41:17.028
Trying to get away from me, huh?

01:41:17.113 --> 01:41:18.572
He's stopped.

01:41:25.913 --> 01:41:28.999
Come on. Are they your friends?

01:42:15.046 --> 01:42:17.339
Move. Ali. Ali, Yassem.

01:42:21.844 --> 01:42:23.553
Get the fuck out! Move!

01:42:27.934 --> 01:42:29.184
Yassem! Yassem!

01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:30.769
Ali! Ali! No!

01:42:30.853 --> 01:42:32.896
- No! Yassem! Yassem!
- This is for my wife!

01:42:54.961 --> 01:42:56.002
Latif?

01:42:58.881 --> 01:43:00.340
No! Please stop!

01:43:03.344 --> 01:43:04.803
No! No!

01:43:15.398 --> 01:43:16.773
Out of my way!

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:23.238
Move!

01:43:28.578 --> 01:43:29.911
You, stop!

01:43:29.996 --> 01:43:31.496
Move, move!

01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:33.623
Stop!

01:43:55.104 --> 01:44:02.569
Clear the area!

01:44:03.696 --> 01:44:05.113
Move!
