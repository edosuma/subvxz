00:01.001 --> 00:03.503
Ah! Don't do that!

NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:06.172 --> 00:08.675
It's not just you, you know,
Mahoney has it in for the whole precinct.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.761
I will prove to you there was a knife.
I will go find it.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.097
A man is moving
into the Dante Projects

00:14.180 --> 00:15.515
tomorrow who's running for mayor.

00:15.598 --> 00:19.269
It's the living conditions of these people
in the projects that I'm concerned with.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.188
-You just won 100 grand.
-Yeah!

00:22.272 --> 00:23.606
Yeah, they're leaving with me, Bobby.

00:23.690 --> 00:27.527
A thousand says
the girls are changing their plans.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.611
Here we are.

00:28.945 --> 00:32.032
-Two full-fledged Lamaze scholars.
-Yup.

00:32.115 --> 00:34.367
-Find the arm and bring it in.
-Arm? What arm?

00:34.451 --> 00:38.371
And you put Jesus Martinez in jail
or this guy is gonna die.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.123
-Go, take him.
-Fire.

NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:45.211 --> 00:48.506
Fisk gets some little cockroach
holding a gun to his head,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.216
he ends up an urban Messiah.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.802
I found the knife!
No, no, see here. I'll show you.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.221
Fourteen years
I put in don't count for dirt!

00:55.305 --> 00:57.974
-You're scaring me, man.
-What's it to you?

00:58.058 --> 00:59.893
-(gunshot)
-Mayday!

00:59.976 --> 01:02.145
Mayday! Station under attack!

01:05.690 --> 01:10.028
Item nine,
in light of what is to this podium

01:10.487 --> 01:15.742
Councilman Benjamin Fisk's
incomprehensible resolve

01:16.242 --> 01:17.994
to reoccupy the apartments

01:18.078 --> 01:21.831
which his life's lease
was nearly terminated,

01:22.373 --> 01:24.334
we're temporarily making permanent

01:24.417 --> 01:27.378
the temporary field post
established yesterday

01:27.462 --> 01:29.339
at the Dante Projects.

01:29.422 --> 01:33.009
The post will be under the command
of Lt. Howard Hunter.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.261
Check the roster board for assignments.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.431
-The man doesn't know when to quit.
-It's gonna take a bullet to convince him.

01:38.515 --> 01:41.851
The political mind
works in mysterious ways.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.479
Item ten, pardon the expression,

01:44.562 --> 01:47.565
let's give a hand
for the timely legwork yesterday

01:47.649 --> 01:49.275
of Detectives LaRue and Washington

01:49.359 --> 01:51.945
in affecting the reunion
of Mr. Willard Tisdale

01:52.028 --> 01:54.656
and Mr. Tisdale's errant left arm.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.742
Preliminary reports
indicates surgical success

01:57.826 --> 02:00.912
and a positive prognosis for recovery.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.623
(cheering)

02:03.706 --> 02:06.459
Yeah, that's just great.
And we buy a departmental reprimand.

02:06.543 --> 02:11.965
Item 11, Detective Belker this a.m.
begins a seminar for Hill merchants

02:12.048 --> 02:13.758
recently victimized by crime.

02:13.842 --> 02:18.471
His rubric, the Second Time Around,

02:18.555 --> 02:20.723
Surviving the Urban Crime Experience.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.101
Step one, move on up to the country.

02:23.184 --> 02:26.646
(laughing)

02:26.729 --> 02:30.984
A personal item I'm asked by Officer Hill
to announce the following:

02:31.818 --> 02:34.445
"In order to handle the many requests
for financial aid

02:34.529 --> 02:36.948
I've gotten over the last few days,

02:37.031 --> 02:39.576
I've opened a bank account
for this purpose.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.494
Please make all requests in writing

02:41.578 --> 02:43.913
to Andy Renko
who will be administering the money

02:43.997 --> 02:45.915
and deciding who gets what.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.625
Thanks. Bobby Hill."

02:47.709 --> 02:49.419
Oh, yeah, submit it in writing.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.880
And if possible,
crawl while making the request.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.381
What's your problem, lame?

02:53.464 --> 02:56.217
-Oh, nothing you can't handle, slick.
-Do something about it then.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.344
-Nothing you can't try to buy.
-(laughing)

02:58.428 --> 03:00.847
ESTERHAUS:
All right, men, on a final happy note,

03:01.723 --> 03:05.226
passing the sergeant's exam
this semi-annual go-around,

03:05.310 --> 03:08.646
in tandem, Officers Lucille Bates

03:08.730 --> 03:10.523
and Joseph Coffey.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.859
(cheering)

03:19.115 --> 03:20.867
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.370
And hey, hey, hey.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.290
Let's be particularly careful out there.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.919
-Hey, Luce. Way to go, man.
-Thanks.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.087
Congratulations there, big girl.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.297
Thanks, Andy.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.468
Whoa! (laughs)

03:38.551 --> 03:41.054
JOE: Hey, you have a good time
last night, Bobby?

03:41.137 --> 03:44.140
Not bad. A little busy.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.142
Yeah, well, being a jerk
is a full-time job--

03:46.226 --> 03:48.895
Hey, this is not appropriate.
Congratulations are in order.

03:48.978 --> 03:53.066
Ought to mean a hell of a raise.
What'd you get, four, five bucks a week?

03:53.149 --> 03:56.069
You know, I don't have your expenses
because I don't buy my dates.

03:56.152 --> 04:00.031
I didn't pay for the date, Coff.
I paid to show you for a fool.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.908
-Okay, all right.
-Hey, hey, hey!

04:01.991 --> 04:04.285
-Damn, man, stop it.
-I'm all right.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.912
-That's sick, Bobby.
-Take a walk, man.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.538
-BOBBY: Hey, hey, hey.
-Let me tell you something,

04:07.622 --> 04:09.249
I don't care how many lotteries you win.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.251
I wouldn't be you for all the world.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.128
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch, we have a 9-11.</i>

04:14.212 --> 04:15.922
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:16.005 --> 04:19.968
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:20.051 --> 04:21.511
(sirens wailing)

04:26.933 --> 04:30.853
(theme music playing)

05:37.420 --> 05:40.631
Yo, Furillo.
Sorry we missed connections yesterday.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.928
-You have a parole officer yet?
-Yeah, sure. We just had a meeting.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.014
Seems like an upright citizen.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.601
Gang Intervention is looking
for a sit-down later this week.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.396
My associates and I have been doing
some sitting down of our own, Furillo.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.607
I mean, it's touch and go right now,

05:57.690 --> 06:00.360
but I believe we're coming
to an understanding.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.653
You and I have an understanding, Jesus.
Let's not forget it.

06:02.737 --> 06:08.451
Situation is looking good.
You wanted peace. Me, I'm optimistic.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.329
Yo, Officer.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.875
Whoa, I'm getting to be a regular
wakeup call, aren't I, Captain?

06:17.543 --> 06:19.879
I just heard a story about you and Coffey.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.550
Uh, nothing to it.
We're just good friends.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.344
I'm taking you off the shift today.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.054
-Don't do that.
-I just did.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.848
Look, Bobby, I'm a drunk.
I can feel what kind of spin you're in.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.309
Go home. Lie in for 24 hours.
Things will look different.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.103
I need to work. It's the only time--

06:35.186 --> 06:37.271
On the street you're a mistake
waiting to happen.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.191
I meant what I said the other day.
You can't afford another one.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.526
Get yourself some help, Bobby.

06:41.609 --> 06:44.028
The nightmare can end,
but you got to give it a chance.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.620
Please don't. Just stay away from me.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.168
-I'm gonna have to take a sick day, Sarge.
-All right, Andy.

07:00.336 --> 07:03.714
-Feel better soon, huh?
-I hope so. I hope so.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.428
You're gonna have to be the one to do it.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.221
JOE: No, I don't know what the guy
was trying to prove.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.474
Look, Bobby is very unhappy right now.
You're just gonna have to ignore him.

07:13.558 --> 07:17.103
Hey, everybody has reasons.
Charlie Manson had an unhappy childhood.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.064
Okay. Hey, you want to find out
where we finished?

07:21.482 --> 07:22.400
Yeah.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.030
Sarge, we'd like to know where we stand--

07:28.114 --> 07:31.909
Well, certainly, Lucy. Most certainly.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.079
You're here.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.915
-Third.
-Congratulations.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.918
And Joseph, you finished...

07:41.878 --> 07:44.672
-Twenty-third?
-Aw.

07:44.755 --> 07:46.632
Hey, I found it! Ms. Bates.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.635
I found the knife!
No, no, see here. I'll show you.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.597
I told you it was there.
I went back to the first light.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.849
It was in the rain gutter
across the street.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.143
J. Eldridge must have thrown it
when he got out of the cab.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.061
But this is the one.
Blue handle, remember?

07:59.145 --> 08:02.315
Here, you take it.
So we have him now. Am I correct?

08:02.398 --> 08:04.942
Well, is that the way you picked it up
when you found it?

08:05.026 --> 08:06.152
Yes. Yes, of course.

08:06.235 --> 08:09.614
I went back to Ms. Davenport's office
when I found it, but she wasn't there.

08:09.697 --> 08:11.866
Yeah, it's 7:15.
It's a little early, Kiki.

08:11.949 --> 08:13.284
(chuckles) It's a wonderful morning.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.578
-So what time is your hearing?
-Eleven-thirty.

08:15.953 --> 08:18.247
-Okay, we'll take this to forensics.
-Very good.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.958
-Yeah, if we can get a print off it now.
-Yes.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.461
What he's saying is maybe
because the way you held it--

08:23.544 --> 08:25.838
-Yes.
-Never mind.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.840
-We'll see you there.
-Thank you.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.678
Chief.

08:33.471 --> 08:36.390
-See you at three today, huh?
-I'll need a raincheck, Ray.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.559
This Fisk thing yesterday.

08:40.436 --> 08:43.105
How many pictures do you suppose those
media flacks took yesterday, Frank, huh?

08:43.189 --> 08:46.776
High hundreds?
See what they put on the front page?

08:48.152 --> 08:51.072
-"Daniels on the scene."
-Look at the look on my puss.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.198
A little uncomfortable.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.869
The man is now positioned to blow me
completely out of the water.

08:56.953 --> 08:59.455
The overnights are extremely discouraging.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.874
There's a tremendous swing
in the undecideds towards Fisk,

09:01.958 --> 09:04.001
erosion of the chief
support among liberals.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.338
Fisk gets some little cockroach
holding a gun to his head,

09:07.421 --> 09:08.965
he ends up an urban Messiah.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.800
Give me a hint, Chief.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.470
Fisk is about to move
back into that apartment.

09:14.845 --> 09:17.139
The airtime could turn this into a rout.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.768
Now, that apartment
is still a crime scene.

09:22.645 --> 09:26.190
-Police lines came down two hours ago.
-I want him kept out of there.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.694
Put the lines back up.
Get some more detailed forensics.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.487
Lab unit finished at 9:00 last night.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.532
If those lines go back up, it'll be seen
as deliberate obstruction.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.122
Great. Let him back in.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.584
Then no doubt the Madonna will appear
on the apartment wall.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.549
I'll reschedule.
I'm just under the gun right now.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.883
-When?
-When what?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.720
-When will you reschedule?
-Soon, Ray, soon.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.889
Don't be a pain in the butt,
will you please?

09:59.932 --> 10:03.269
Look, we'll do it.
We'll do it by the end of the week.

10:03.352 --> 10:04.353
I promise.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.734
Sergeant Esterhaus. Well, hello, Fay.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.903
No, Henry-- It's not time, is it?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.363
You're absolutely certain?

10:14.905 --> 10:16.824
At the very first contraction,

10:16.907 --> 10:19.327
you just sound that beeper
and Henry will be there.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.538
If I weren't chained to the desk,
I'd be there, too.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.416
Well, that's kind of you to say.

10:25.833 --> 10:29.378
Just keep calm
and smooth sailing all the way.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.423
-Hello, Francis.
-How is she?

10:33.090 --> 10:35.509
-Oh, she's fine. Just checking in.
-Thanks, Phil.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.929
(indistinct chattering)

10:42.683 --> 10:44.393
Something I can help you with, sir?

10:45.144 --> 10:47.313
The Second Time Around. Catchy.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.858
-When's your lecture start?
-Eleven o'clock.

10:51.984 --> 10:56.697
-No problems addressing groups I hope.
-I don't know, sir. I never did it before.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.867
This could be a brand-new
start for you, Belker.

10:59.950 --> 11:03.454
Community relations.
A whole new future in the department.

11:10.961 --> 11:11.962
Hey, Lester.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.131
I know I have some change here.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.550
-I know I have some change.
-Give me the buck.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.844
-I wanted to get rid of--
-For crying out loud, here.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.472
-What's that for?
-I paid for it. Go on, man.

11:24.016 --> 11:26.018
Take it easy, my friend.
You'll give yourself an ulcer.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.187
-Where's the game, Lester?
-Hotel Lorraine.

11:28.270 --> 11:32.316
Room 203.
Wait, wait, wait. Got to give them this.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.401
All right, thanks.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.115
(car starts)

11:40.866 --> 11:42.201
(shouting)

11:44.453 --> 11:45.538
Got a ticket for me, cousin?

11:45.621 --> 11:47.081
-I lost it.
-Yeah, well, who sent you?

11:47.164 --> 11:49.333
-Sam Cooke. Bobby! Bobby!
-Invite only.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.711
The guy's a friend of mine in there, okay?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.546
Can I just go in and talk to him?

11:53.629 --> 11:54.964
Bobby, would you please tell this guy

11:55.047 --> 11:56.632
to let me come in there
and talk to you for a minute?

11:58.217 --> 12:00.970
Go away, Renko. Six!

12:01.262 --> 12:04.056
-What are you staring at, man?
-Look, your buddy's busy, cuz.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.558
I'm gonna tell you something right now.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.059
See this right here? I'm a police officer.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.061
I'm off duty and out of precinct.
If me and my buddy

12:09.145 --> 12:11.313
aren't out of here in 30 seconds,
I'm gonna bust this game.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.606
-You got it?
-Easy, cuz.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.067
Do I look like your cousin? Hey!

12:16.610 --> 12:17.820
Are we gonna shoot or what?

12:19.196 --> 12:20.322
New shooter coming.

12:21.699 --> 12:22.992
We got no problem, officers.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.869
-Why don't you go straighten things out?
-He's not with me.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.997
-I am, too, with him.
-I'm already out three grand, man.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.915
We'll be here
if you don't get us shut down.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.459
-Come on, let's take a little--
-Come on, man.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.960
New shooter coming out.

12:33.043 --> 12:38.048
-Come on, man, let's go.
-(chattering)

12:38.132 --> 12:39.759
-Now talk. What do you mean, no?
-No, no.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.177
You said you want to talk.
I want to hear you talk!

12:41.260 --> 12:43.721
All right, I'mma tell you something.
You and me are going back to your crib.

12:43.804 --> 12:44.764
We're gonna have a conversation.

12:44.847 --> 12:47.057
-You can come peaceful or otherwise.
-What do you mean otherwise?

12:47.141 --> 12:48.517
What makes you think
you can make it stick?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.519
Maybe I can, maybe I can't.

12:54.565 --> 12:55.941
Then will you leave me alone?

12:56.484 --> 12:58.569
Yeah, we'll see. We'll see after we talk.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.617
What? What?

13:04.700 --> 13:08.037
Okay, tell me what's happening, Robert,
because I do not recognize you.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.498
You're turning into someone
that I do not recognize anymore.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.540
I'll tell you what's happening.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.585
I'm OD'd by having people
on my case and sitting in judgement.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.462
I'm not sitting in judgement on you!

13:16.545 --> 13:18.923
-What do you call it?!
-You're scaring me, man.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.967
I see you gambling. I see you out there
messing around with those women.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.719
The way you treated
Joe Coffey this morning.

13:24.345 --> 13:25.596
What's it to you?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.474
-What's it to you?
-You are my friend.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.267
I figure you got some kind of fever,

13:30.351 --> 13:32.812
and I should just sit here
with you while it goes by.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.983
You should just leave me alone.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.277
Just let me do what I want to do.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.244
-Is that it?
-That's it.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.831
You seem like you're all chewed up.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.750
It's my own situation.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.630
It doesn't have to be.
You and me are buddies.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.174
Here's where a friend
just walks away, Renko.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.553
If you're my friend, Renko,
you'll just let me be.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.764
What, so you can blow
all the rest of the money

14:08.848 --> 14:10.516
in Olympic record time?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.063
So what?

14:17.481 --> 14:19.984
You got yours. Twice.

14:28.993 --> 14:29.994
Here.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.746
Keep it.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.875
You're a real high roller, Bobby.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.461
Looks like you're willing to gamble
just about anything.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.681
You made no threatening gesture
whatsoever at Mr. Chabundi

14:50.764 --> 14:53.183
while you were seated in the backseat
of his cab?

14:53.267 --> 14:54.977
None of any kind.

14:55.561 --> 14:58.230
-You didn't menace him with a knife?
-Nope.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.234
In other words, Mr. Chabundi shot you
utterly without provocation?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.489
Uh-huh.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.577
No further questions, Your Honor.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.330
Anyone else, Ms. DA?

15:14.788 --> 15:16.165
No one, Your Honor.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.250
You're excused, Mr. Eldridge.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.755
Counsel approach.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.761
Let's get rid of this one, people.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.554
That knife he brought in may be worthless,

15:30.638 --> 15:33.933
but defendant has a clean record.
He's a student.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.686
Even if we accept Mr. Eldridge's version,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.606
which I must say,
strange credibility somewhat.

15:41.106 --> 15:44.276
He insists that the attack
was unprovoked, Your Honor.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.236
He also has a sheet of rob assaults

15:46.320 --> 15:49.531
which jives with the defendant's version
of the present incident.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.367
(sighs)

15:52.117 --> 15:55.037
I see no more than
a minor misdemeanor here.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.956
Talk to your client, Ms. Davenport.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.875
What kind of misdemeanor
are we discussing?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.002
What'll he take? How about...

16:02.920 --> 16:04.880
unlawful discharge within the city limits?

16:04.964 --> 16:09.301
-That's a $27 fine, Your Honor.
-Let me confer.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.808
Kiki, judge will agree to let you off
with a misdemeanor.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.644
-That's a $27 fine. No, listen to me.
-No, no.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.729
What of immigration?
What of the taxi board?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.899
-KIKI: No, no, I mustn't.
-Ms. Davenport?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.903
Uh, Your Honor, can we get a brief recess?

16:28.737 --> 16:32.241
It is not the intention of this court
to coerce a plea from anyone.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.245
I gather the defendant prefers trial
on the current charge?

16:36.328 --> 16:38.247
-I think if--
-Yes, I am innocent.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.419
Hold for grand jury. Set a long date.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.839
Defendant remains free
on his own recognizance.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.841
-(taps gavel)
-Next case.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.095
203518. Hochberg.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.517
Kiki, listen.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.354
You said you trusted that I was
looking after your best interests.

17:02.438 --> 17:05.524
-Do you still believe that?
-Yes, I know that you have.

17:05.733 --> 17:09.445
What the judge was offering you was fair.
It's preferable to a trial.

17:10.279 --> 17:13.240
I see. I simply plead guilty.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.369
If you're worried about immigration,
the judge will write a letter. I will.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.040
Ms. Davenport,
you understand with your understanding.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.541
What does that mean?

17:23.125 --> 17:25.461
I am very grateful
for your efforts on my behalf,

17:26.336 --> 17:28.047
but Mr. Eldridge should tell the truth.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.175
I wouldn't hold your breath
waiting for that.

17:31.925 --> 17:33.218
Please, think about it overnight.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.095
We can still change our plea.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.639
Thank you, Ms. Davenport.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.933
Thank you very much.

17:42.227 --> 17:45.481
So you could either go from here to here
or from here to here.

17:49.943 --> 17:52.988
All right, step three, the gun.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.033
If the perpetrator is armed with a pistol

17:56.116 --> 17:59.828
or other firearm,
the most important first response

17:59.912 --> 18:01.246
is to remain...

18:03.207 --> 18:06.668
-calm.
-(clamoring)

18:08.295 --> 18:11.548
Follow the perpetrator's demands quickly
and efficiently.

18:11.632 --> 18:16.970
Do not do anything to upset him
especially if you suspect he may be...

18:19.431 --> 18:21.683
-(clamoring)
-MAN: May be what?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.853
-...on drugs.
-(clamoring)

18:24.937 --> 18:27.689
You are telling us
how to give them our money!

18:27.773 --> 18:30.275
We want to know how to stop them!

18:30.359 --> 18:31.443
-Yeah.
-That's right.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.990
-You have to let us handle the arrests.
-Two days ago I am robbed.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.534
I call the police.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.204
While I'm waiting for them to come
the robber comes back and beats me up.

18:42.287 --> 18:46.083
By the time they come he's long gone.
That's how much help the police are!

18:46.166 --> 18:48.627
It used to be a cop
walked the beat on my street.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.212
Now all they want to do is ride around.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.548
We don't have enough cops
for that anymore!

18:52.631 --> 18:54.174
What it is, is you don't care.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.885
You want to ride around in cars
so you can sleep in the back.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.054
-Now that's not true!
-(clamoring)

18:59.138 --> 19:02.141
I've been robbed three times
by the same hoodlum.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.852
He knows the police
will not do anything to stop him.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.062
-You think it's our fault?
-MAN: Whose is it?

19:09.940 --> 19:14.027
A bunch of politicians started
playing football with this department!

19:14.111 --> 19:18.448
A bunch of bureaucrats
would rather see us chained to desks

19:18.532 --> 19:20.242
than out on the street where we belong.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.286
And if you don't think
I'm telling the truth,

19:22.369 --> 19:24.413
why the hell am I standing here
talking to you

19:24.496 --> 19:26.915
when I should be out doing my?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.126
Wait a minute!
You think I want to do this?

19:29.209 --> 19:32.921
-Mick.
-You think I enjoy feeling like a jerk?!

19:33.005 --> 19:35.090
-Mick.
-I'm talking to them!

19:35.174 --> 19:37.718
No, that's enough now.
Lt. Calletano will finish.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.687
-RAY: Are there any questions?
-(clamoring)

19:53.483 --> 19:55.903
I'm going nuts.
I mean it, I'm climbing the walls here.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.821
-Mick.
-Some suit comes along,

19:57.905 --> 20:00.616
-picks me out, nobody backs me up.
-That's not true.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.993
Fourteen years I put in
don't count for dirt!

20:03.076 --> 20:05.204
-Look, I know--
-I got to get back on the street.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.788
No, you'll get hanged.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.959
Maybe I don't care anymore.
Maybe it's not worth it.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.463
I can't answer that, Mick.
It's your career, not mine.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.132
But if I were you, I'd sit.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.521
-Say, man.
-Hang on just a second.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.026
-Mr. McCordy.
-(chattering)

20:36.109 --> 20:39.112
Hey, how you doing?
I'm gonna have to do something here.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.073
Please accept the apology, huh?

20:41.782 --> 20:45.202
-Please forgive me for the circumstances.
-I understand.

20:45.285 --> 20:47.621
You hear somebody's a cop,
you got to look for a wire.

20:47.704 --> 20:48.956
It's okay.

20:49.039 --> 20:53.001
-Can I go play some more dice?
-Absolutely. Let's go.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.837
Look, I'm gonna call you Joe, all right?

20:56.630 --> 20:58.006
That isn't your real name, is it?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.300
-No.
-So I'll just call you Joe.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.636
Now look, anything you want,
you just holler.

21:02.719 --> 21:04.346
Just let them know, all right?

21:04.429 --> 21:06.139
-Yeah, thanks.
-Go get 'em now.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.100
Make eight good passes, huh?

21:09.268 --> 21:10.394
Money player.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.146
Make some room, boys.
Want to shoot 'em, sir?

21:13.230 --> 21:15.357
-Yeah.
-Got to place a bet first.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.320
Here they come, here they roll. Watch 'em.

21:20.404 --> 21:22.030
Come on, baby. Come on.

21:26.034 --> 21:28.287
-Mocha java, Henry?
-HENRY: No thanks.

21:34.167 --> 21:38.422
Listen, about yesterday. Oh, sport.
(sighs)

21:40.215 --> 21:43.260
My apologies for whatever part
I might have inadvertently played

21:43.343 --> 21:45.762
in causing harsh words between us.

21:45.846 --> 21:46.888
Forget it.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.017
Of course, I don't believe
I was exclusively at fault.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.436
I'm sure I was at fault, too, Howard.

21:52.519 --> 21:55.480
You see, but right now
you're on my B-list for apologies.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.276
About to put a kid
in Potter's field has first call.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.070
Young Ruiz?

22:03.655 --> 22:08.910
Oh, I don't see that you
behaved other than responsibly, Henry.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.496
You wouldn't?

22:14.207 --> 22:17.419
Hey, I'm just in a bad mood today.

22:18.253 --> 22:21.173
After I play Judas it always takes me
24 hours to feel chipper again.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.758
(crying)

22:27.012 --> 22:30.974
-Excuse us, Ballantine!
-Councilman Fisk is here, Lieutenant.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.517
It's all right. It's all right.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.146
-Gentlemen.
-Morning, Councilman.

22:36.229 --> 22:39.524
The situation seems
to be well in hand here.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.234
Well, all things considered.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.489
I'd say you don't look
the worse for the wear yourself.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.366
Wear is on the inside.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.910
I'm seeing some press in a few minutes,

22:49.993 --> 22:52.120
and I thought
I should check in with your first.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.705
Um...

22:54.331 --> 22:56.458
Um, where are you seeing them?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.543
-Oh, in--
-In his apartment.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.963
Give them a little photo opportunity
before you move back in?

23:04.508 --> 23:05.592
That's right.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.306
Excuse me.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.524
FISK: Lt. Goldblume.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.026
Yeah?

23:25.028 --> 23:28.615
Yesterday, I stopped counting the times
you saved my life.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.992
They hustled me off to the hospital,
I never got to thank you.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.202
That's all right.

23:33.578 --> 23:37.499
You and Hector
clearly had some history together.

23:37.582 --> 23:41.670
I'm sure it was very,
very difficult for you.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.590
When you get a chance, Henry,
would you give me a call sometime?

23:46.675 --> 23:48.093
I'd like to talk to you about all this.

23:49.261 --> 23:51.012
Make some sense out of it.

23:52.806 --> 23:56.184
-Sure. Sometime.
-The press is here, Ben.

23:58.979 --> 24:03.442
Well, I'll see you later.

24:08.321 --> 24:10.323
REPORTER: Aren't people going to question
your motive, Councilman,

24:10.407 --> 24:12.451
moving back in here so quickly?

24:12.534 --> 24:16.413
-I assume that's what you're doing.
-(laughter)

24:16.496 --> 24:19.791
No, my feeling is
if what happened here yesterday

24:19.875 --> 24:23.128
puts the spotlight on me,
better it should be on here.

24:23.211 --> 24:24.463
This is what's important.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.256
You said you have a number
of social programs

24:26.339 --> 24:28.675
-that you're proposing.
-You know, it's a funny thing,

24:29.259 --> 24:32.596
I came here as a visitor.
Basically, I thought I could learn.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.222
The sad truth is it wasn't until

24:34.306 --> 24:36.141
I was trapped in here
with a gun to my head

24:36.224 --> 24:39.478
that I had the slightest idea what these
people's lives are really like.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.021
Sure, I've got some ideas.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.773
I'd like to see an escort service
for the older people.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.485
A milk program.
A domestic arbitration service.

24:46.568 --> 24:49.154
Mr. Fisk, aren't these programs
some of the same demands

24:49.237 --> 24:51.239
made by the man who held
you here hostage yesterday?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.450
Yes, that's right. And I'm proud of it.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.911
Listen, Hector Ruiz was a casualty

24:55.994 --> 24:59.998
long before his brains were splattered
against these walls yesterday.

25:00.081 --> 25:04.252
I'd hoped these programs might memorialize
his hopes for his community.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.922
But, Mr. Fisk, isn't it a little
more complicated than just--?

25:07.005 --> 25:09.049
FISK: Listen, it's not complicated.

25:09.132 --> 25:12.761
The only thing that's complicated
is our inability to do anything about it.

25:12.844 --> 25:15.680
You want the words to explain
why that kid died yesterday?

25:15.764 --> 25:18.600
Look around you. This is eloquent.

25:18.683 --> 25:22.062
A world that every day conspires
to deprive the people who live here

25:22.145 --> 25:24.314
of their simple human dignity.

25:24.898 --> 25:28.318
Children growing up here,
it's an exercise in terror.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.655
If the elevators don't get you,
then maybe it'll be the rats

25:31.738 --> 25:33.907
that live in these hallways.
They own the place.

25:33.990 --> 25:36.076
Look around.
This hallway is a shooting gallery.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.787
You know what that is?
What if you found your kid

25:38.870 --> 25:41.706
playing with the syringes
he picked up in front of your door?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.291
We're a few floors up here.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.085
How would you feel if you found out
that the grillwork

25:45.168 --> 25:48.964
on these windows hasn't been inspected
in over-- (screams)

25:49.047 --> 25:51.049
Fine.

25:52.717 --> 25:55.470
(clamoring)

25:55.554 --> 25:57.305
Move! Come on!

25:57.931 --> 26:01.351
Mayday! Mayday! Station under attack!

26:01.434 --> 26:05.564
All units, move in from the perimeter.
Station under attack! I repeat, respond.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.023
All units, damn it!

26:07.482 --> 26:09.359
And red dog it, boy.
This is no drop drill.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.027
MAN (on radio):
<i>Copy, got a niner on the way.</i>

26:11.111 --> 26:12.821
FLETCHER:
First four units use the south entry.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.948
Follow up from the west,
standard formations and hurry.

26:15.031 --> 26:17.409
<i>I have 43 and 46 on approach.</i>

26:18.118 --> 26:19.411
Oh, God.

26:23.790 --> 26:27.043
Endorphins, Henry,
are organically produced opiates.

26:27.502 --> 26:30.922
And under massive stress
the cortex floods the system.

26:31.006 --> 26:33.633
Believe me,
that poor bastard never knew what hit him.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.594
I don't think I want to talk
about this right now, Howard.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.305
Frank, Frank,
we have to rope off the front steps.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.223
There must be a dozen
press crews out there.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.641
Tell Phil to just keep them out there.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.560
Daniels will issue a statement
as soon as he gets here.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.477
All right.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.771
Guess it must have been
pretty awful, huh, Lieutenant?

26:46.855 --> 26:52.110
Oh, in all my days, Leo.
We opened the door and there was Fisk.

26:53.236 --> 26:56.364
And there was Fisk. And there was Fisk.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.367
Can you believe Daniels snatching victory
out of the jaws of death?

27:00.118 --> 27:01.703
I guess he just lives his life right, huh?

27:01.786 --> 27:03.371
Worst way to go I can think of.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.874
You ask me,
the worst way would be eaten by a lion

27:05.957 --> 27:07.792
and have to sit there
and watch while he chewed

27:07.876 --> 27:09.461
chunks of flesh out of your body.

27:09.544 --> 27:11.296
NEAL: That's bad. That's bad.
No doubt about that.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.965
Yeah but wait a minute,
what if you're home all alone

27:14.049 --> 27:16.801
and you choke on a sandwich, you see,
and nobody's there to help you.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.555
Hey, imagine sliding down a banister

27:20.639 --> 27:23.183
that turns out to be
a gigantic razor blade

27:23.266 --> 27:25.685
and he lands in a vat of iodine.

27:26.353 --> 27:29.481
Can you imagine what must have been
going on in his mind on the way down?

27:29.564 --> 27:31.441
I can't get that out of my head.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.068
I bet he was thinking about food.

27:33.151 --> 27:34.110
-What?
-LUCY: Food?

27:34.611 --> 27:37.864
-He knew he'd never eat again.
-(laughter)

27:37.947 --> 27:39.199
Will you shut up?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.618
Will you just shut up about it?

27:47.248 --> 27:48.708
Can I talk to you for a second?

28:00.053 --> 28:00.929
So talk.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.264
So ever since we got word
on the sergeant's exam

28:03.348 --> 28:05.016
you've been acting like a four-year-old.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.269
-And?
-And cut it out.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.357
Do you know how many people
are gonna have to get promoted

28:12.440 --> 28:14.359
or croak ahead of me?

28:14.818 --> 28:17.028
-How hard did you study?
-What?

28:17.278 --> 28:19.447
How hard did you study?
I worked my butt off to pass the exam.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.408
-How hard?
-I studied.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.743
Yeah, you studied all right.
You studied fun with twins.

28:23.827 --> 28:24.828
-That's what you studied.
-Wait a minute.

28:24.911 --> 28:27.163
You know something,
you are a great guy, Joe.

28:27.247 --> 28:30.208
You're my partner and I love you,
but I'm tired.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.293
You're getting along on this sweet smile
and muscles stuff.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.796
Now you're feeling sorry for yourself
and you're doing a number on me

28:34.879 --> 28:37.048
-and I got no patience for that.
-Hold on--

28:37.132 --> 28:38.883
No. No sympathy, Joseph.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.261
I offered to study with you.
How many times? Three, four times.

28:41.344 --> 28:42.303
You turned me down.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.472
Just knock it off, that's all.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.601
I know you're mad at Bobby Hill.
Just don't take it out on me.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.562
That's it.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.523
(water splashes)

28:58.486 --> 28:59.571
(chuckles)

29:00.697 --> 29:02.323
Feel like I've been suffocating.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.659
Can't get any air.

29:05.910 --> 29:06.828
Feel any better?

29:11.374 --> 29:13.084
-Been angry with you, Frank.
-I know.

29:14.335 --> 29:15.545
Gangs, election.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.007
Felt like it climbed into a shell,
made everybody's choices for them.

29:19.090 --> 29:20.717
I don't disagree with you, Henry.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.386
But I'd ask you to understand

29:23.470 --> 29:27.557
that every boss I have has had his hands
on the wheels and...

29:29.851 --> 29:32.270
Well, it's not easy to...

29:33.563 --> 29:35.565
I probably overreacted
and I haven't delegated.

29:35.648 --> 29:37.776
-And it's cost us.
-No argument.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.905
(sighs)

29:43.198 --> 29:44.657
So I've got a grievance.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.538
I've been nursing this like a sick flower.
I don't know what's the matter with me.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.291
I feel like hell.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.252
It occurs to me, Henry,

29:56.336 --> 30:00.256
that a man with your kind
of strong family feeling,

30:01.299 --> 30:03.802
separated from-from Rachel and Josh,

30:03.885 --> 30:08.598
and trying to help Fay
get ready for a baby,

30:08.681 --> 30:10.266
might not be the easiest thing
in the world--

30:10.350 --> 30:11.976
It's the only thing I enjoy.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.312
I understand, but it might, um...

30:14.813 --> 30:16.314
I mean, it might open up...

30:17.440 --> 30:19.025
How empty my life is.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.196
What a tough time you're in.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.074
It's two years, Frank.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.952
Think this will qualify as a phase?

30:29.035 --> 30:31.120
-Henry.
-Uh-huh?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.624
I really hope things get better.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.753
Thanks.

30:42.924 --> 30:45.552
FRANK: Uh-huh, sure. I will.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.222
I'm gonna be straight with you, Frank.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.601
To be the beneficiary of this kind
of misfortune is a dreadful stroke.

30:54.644 --> 30:55.687
Agreed.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.024
This precinct is the center
of the universe for the next few days.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.027
Anything we can do for his family.
Anything at all I can do for you.

31:03.111 --> 31:04.863
I want a meeting with you and Mahoney.

31:05.572 --> 31:09.200
-I'm sure we can find a time.
-I want him off my back today.

31:09.909 --> 31:10.910
All right, Frank.

31:11.411 --> 31:16.332
The office will contact him and we'll meet
back here at say, 5:00. How's that?

31:16.416 --> 31:17.917
-That's fine.
-Good.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.004
Well, I've got to give my statement.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.300
You know, you wake up on a day like this,

31:25.383 --> 31:28.052
you've got a schedule,
events strung out in front of you.

31:29.178 --> 31:32.223
(sighs)
We're never promised tomorrow, my friend.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.226
Well, I guess I better get out there

31:35.310 --> 31:37.228
and squelch the rumors
my guys had anything

31:37.312 --> 31:39.022
to do with loosening those bolts.

31:41.816 --> 31:43.109
That's a joke, Frank.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.531
Seven. No six. Seven out, nine away.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.783
Unbelievable. Guy busts me on every roll.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.327
Ain't nobody trying to lose, pal.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.953
Just seems like a talent you got,
that's all.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.206
-How's it going? How's it going?
-No good.

31:57.290 --> 32:01.753
Take a break. Let him turn around.
Come on. You want a meal or something?

32:01.836 --> 32:03.046
Want some company?

32:04.839 --> 32:05.757
No.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.345
-If I wanted, could I get some credit?
-Sure, we'll set you up with a line.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.347
I got the money. The bank's just closed.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.098
No problem. We'll set you up with a line.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.267
Let me get your real name,
a couple references.

32:16.976 --> 32:18.811
-How's that?
-Yeah, okay.

32:18.895 --> 32:20.146
All right, so you give me your real name.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.440
Look, I'll get you the money
as soon as the bank opens.

32:22.523 --> 32:24.776
You see, I'm sure you're good for it,
but you got to give me your name.

32:24.859 --> 32:28.947
-Just let me play. I'll pay you back.
-You got to give me your name.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.616
-What's the problem?
-No, sir.

32:31.699 --> 32:33.993
No, sir. No!

32:53.096 --> 32:55.932
I got tired of squatting out in the hall
so I picked the lock.

32:56.891 --> 32:58.893
You were pretty sure
I was gonna come home?

32:59.769 --> 33:01.104
I had a hunch.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.150
(sighs)

33:08.653 --> 33:09.737
So how'd it go?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.119
It went.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.080
All of it?

33:23.334 --> 33:25.294
$30,000 left.

33:28.172 --> 33:31.300
I'm gonna pay a year's mortgage

33:31.384 --> 33:33.970
in St. Louis on my mother's house
and then...

33:36.764 --> 33:37.807
I'm gonna buy a car.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.524
One day at a time, man. What can you do?

33:48.359 --> 33:49.861
(crying)

33:54.741 --> 33:57.869
Bobby, let me help you. I can help you.

33:59.078 --> 34:02.749
Oh, man, I've got to
handle this myself, cowboy.

34:03.791 --> 34:04.959
No one can.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.046
I got to try.

34:12.341 --> 34:16.387
Ever since I won this money,
I've had dreams, I've...

34:18.097 --> 34:19.807
I've had nightmares where I...

34:21.601 --> 34:22.727
I blow up.

34:23.603 --> 34:24.812
I'm gonna explode.

34:26.105 --> 34:30.443
I always promised myself
that I would accept my responsibilities

34:30.526 --> 34:31.736
and never...

34:33.196 --> 34:35.364
Never want for anything I couldn't have.

34:36.115 --> 34:37.200
Um...

34:42.371 --> 34:45.041
I hated my daddy. He was a loose man.

34:47.126 --> 34:48.836
He never cared about anyone.

34:49.378 --> 34:51.798
But I like people.

34:51.881 --> 34:54.383
-I like-- I like you and--
-I like you, too.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.930
(crying) I...

35:00.681 --> 35:03.434
I didn't want to be loose, Andy.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.645
But it seems that...

35:07.980 --> 35:12.693
I always have to hold myself so tight
and it just seems...

35:13.528 --> 35:15.113
a loose man's screwing with my mind.

35:15.196 --> 35:18.366
And I... If I want to be good, I got...

35:18.449 --> 35:20.910
- Bobby--
- I got to be careful.

35:22.745 --> 35:24.288
If I want to be good.

35:24.580 --> 35:26.124
Bobby, I don't quite follow you.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.673
That a man with money

35:34.423 --> 35:35.758
and freedom...

35:35.842 --> 35:40.263
(sobbing) ...is... is loose in my mind.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.557
And I hate him.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.147
You don't have to be loose.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.400
I don't want to be cruel.

35:53.359 --> 35:54.735
I know you don't.

35:55.945 --> 35:57.071
You don't have to be.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.199
(sniffles)

36:03.703 --> 36:04.662
All right.

36:11.335 --> 36:12.795
Here, this is yours.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.507
I don't need that.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.929
Keep it. From a friend.

36:27.226 --> 36:30.938
Well, that's pretty loose, Robert,

36:31.647 --> 36:33.274
but I don't think it's so cruel.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.780
I don't know, man. I just--

36:39.864 --> 36:43.034
I was-- It was like a...

36:44.243 --> 36:45.995
a monster was loose.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.125
All right.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.628
All right.

37:01.802 --> 37:03.512
Hey, Officer Coffey.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.849
-What do you want?
-I'm a little upset, Joe.

37:06.933 --> 37:09.352
The girls tell me you're supposed to
see them again tonight.

37:09.435 --> 37:11.312
We had a conversation.

37:11.395 --> 37:13.397
Unless, of course, Bobby Hill makes a bid.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.024
Hey, maybe your friend
was a little bolder,

37:15.107 --> 37:16.692
but he had the right idea.

37:17.485 --> 37:18.861
What are you talking about?

37:21.197 --> 37:23.407
I'm talking groceries. I'm talking rent.

37:23.491 --> 37:26.535
I'm talking wardrobe
and makeup and dry cleaning.

37:26.619 --> 37:29.288
I'm talking a personal
financial relationship, Joe,

37:29.372 --> 37:31.874
because these girls
have their careers to think about.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.334
Let me tell you something.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.169
If I want to see 'em, I'm gonna see 'em.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.588
No, no. You want to see them,
you're going to see me.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.341
-Yeah, right.
-Believe it, pal.

37:42.218 --> 37:45.763
-Do they know you're doing this?
-I got no secrets from these girls.

37:49.183 --> 37:50.184
You know they like me.

37:50.268 --> 37:53.854
They are actresses, my friend.
Hearts of gold they don't need.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.941
You don't want to help us out,
fine, we'll part as friends.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.818
You little pimp.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.696
It was a dream you had one night, Joe.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.864
How many guys can say that?

38:04.448 --> 38:07.368
You stay clear now. Thanks for everything.

38:09.620 --> 38:12.248
-Bates, Coffey.
-Damn.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.875
Disturbance at 116th and Dickard Avenue.

38:15.042 --> 38:16.210
Man with a weapon.

38:18.587 --> 38:19.714
Joe.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.383
Little hammer action. Kid's got a swing.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.218
He could make the majors
in about 30 years.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.262
He's over there. Poor kid's freaked out.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.895
I tell him. I tell him, please.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.480
Please, just say the truth.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.650
I'm very nice to him.

38:39.942 --> 38:43.321
I don't want to start the fighting.
I tell him to say it.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.741
Look, Kiki, you're gonna have to come
with us, all right?

38:46.824 --> 38:51.746
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.956
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.208
WOMAN:
At approximately 2:45 this afternoon,

38:56.292 --> 38:58.252
"I went to the apartment of J. Eldridge

38:58.336 --> 39:00.713
to make Mr. Eldridge say of using a knife

39:00.796 --> 39:02.798
in attempting to rob my cab.

39:02.882 --> 39:06.635
And this had been all my reason
for attempting to defend myself.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.180
Mr. Eldridge gave no care of my request

39:09.263 --> 39:12.683
or my immigration situation
if he refused to come with the truth

39:12.767 --> 39:14.769
and losing my means of support.

39:14.852 --> 39:16.771
I asked him on every ground

39:16.854 --> 39:19.523
and what I regret,
I assaulted him with my fists

39:19.607 --> 39:21.609
and with the hammer of his apartment

39:21.692 --> 39:23.527
which he had thrown at me.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.321
I struck him in the eye."

39:25.404 --> 39:26.614
Did he get Miranda?

39:28.532 --> 39:29.575
At the scene.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.119
(crying)

39:34.622 --> 39:35.956
Should I continue?

39:39.794 --> 39:42.129
"And he staggered and went down."

39:42.546 --> 39:46.592
In your zeal to protect me, Dennis,
which needless to say I deeply appreciate,

39:47.343 --> 39:50.221
I think you may have put a few noses
out of joint up here.

39:50.304 --> 39:52.306
FRANK:
He has three of my men up on charges.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.684
Now, Frank Furillo
has a unique situation here.

39:55.768 --> 39:58.729
They Hill is a precinct
with unique problems.

39:59.480 --> 40:01.357
It takes a particular kind of personality

40:01.440 --> 40:04.318
not just in a captain,
but in the men under his command.

40:05.111 --> 40:07.696
With regard to the disciplinary actions

40:07.780 --> 40:11.242
you've initiated against
Detectives LaRue and Washington--

40:11.325 --> 40:12.368
FRANK: And Sgt. Belker.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.870
And Sgt. Belker,

40:15.454 --> 40:17.706
I think that everyone's best interests

40:17.790 --> 40:20.459
would be served if those charges
fell between the cracks.

40:20.543 --> 40:21.502
No problem here.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.423
As well as the insubordination charges
against the captain himself.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.009
-Right into the shredder.
-I'm delighted.

40:29.760 --> 40:30.928
For your part, Frank,

40:33.055 --> 40:35.433
Deputy Chief Mahoney
is a fact of your life.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.517
He's your superior.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.228
And if the fates
are kind to Fletcher Daniels,

40:39.311 --> 40:42.022
he may just be a little more superior
in a few weeks.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.943
You'd best learn to live with it.
You might even try to learn from him.

40:46.402 --> 40:49.572
Well, did anyone send out
for a peace pipe?

40:50.739 --> 40:52.867
Then this will have to do.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.746
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Chief, the <i>Telegram</i> is on the phone.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.707
-They'd like your statement.
-Thank you.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.460
Now if you fellas would let me
get out of here.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.130
How the hell do you keep
from seeming ghoulish

41:06.213 --> 41:07.756
in a situation like this?

41:08.382 --> 41:09.717
It's just tragic.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.140
We all square, Frank?

41:16.932 --> 41:19.059
Uh, seems to be for now.

41:19.810 --> 41:23.647
Of course, if I do become chief
if the fates are kind,

41:24.732 --> 41:28.068
everyone has their own style
and standards, Frank.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.613
I'd expect you to come up to mine.

41:33.824 --> 41:35.910
I'm busy right now, Dennis.

41:35.993 --> 41:37.620
I guess I'd insist on it.

41:39.413 --> 41:40.539
Would you leave it open?

42:00.017 --> 42:03.896
I share the pain of this entire city.
Today we have lost a champion.

42:04.271 --> 42:08.317
-I'll call you back later.
-Charges have been dropped.

42:11.028 --> 42:11.862
Thank you.

42:12.613 --> 42:14.240
If you see J.D. or Neil before I do,

42:14.323 --> 42:16.742
tell them their reprimands
have been taken out of their jackets.

42:16.825 --> 42:19.286
Captain, I know I put you out on this.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.872
In the future, I'm gonna try to, uh,

42:23.123 --> 42:25.042
-to, uh...
-What?

42:26.126 --> 42:28.003
Well, they say that if Chief Daniels

42:28.087 --> 42:30.339
wins the election,
Mahoney's gonna be the new chief.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.341
Mick, look,
you still have to be your own kind of cop.

42:32.424 --> 42:33.842
You have to follow your own instincts.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.719
I mean, I'm the one
out on the street, Captain.

42:35.803 --> 42:36.971
I need Belker out there.

42:37.429 --> 42:40.140
-Well, you got him.
-Francis, we have a homicide.

42:40.641 --> 42:42.142
-It appears gang related.
-Excuse me.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.395
-Homicide?
-Chief.

42:44.478 --> 42:47.189
Gang related?
Frank, you take care of this, personally.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.483
You sit on it.
I will not have this day ruined.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.819
Any more than it has been
by Ben's tragedy.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.613
Forgive me. Of course.

42:54.697 --> 42:57.116
Francis, 104th and State.

42:58.784 --> 42:59.702
Mick.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.122
Captain.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.127
Homicide.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.546
Joe.

43:11.171 --> 43:12.673
Could I talk to you for a minute?

43:15.175 --> 43:16.218
Uh...

43:18.220 --> 43:20.222
no excuse for last night.

43:20.598 --> 43:23.267
-No excuse for what I did.
-Yeah, you got that right.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.437
I'm sorry.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.023
What was going on?

43:30.441 --> 43:32.693
I had a little visit from Mr. Hyde.

43:35.112 --> 43:37.114
Well, is Dr. Hill back with us or what?

43:39.575 --> 43:40.618
Just checked in.

43:41.827 --> 43:43.787
Well, you tell Mr. Hyde
if he shows his face again

43:43.871 --> 43:45.372
I'm gonna clean his clock.

43:47.875 --> 43:48.917
You got it.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.923
(radio chatter)

43:59.386 --> 44:01.430
They stripped his colors, Frank,
but he's a Blood.

44:01.513 --> 44:04.475
Murdered about an hour ago
at another location.

44:04.558 --> 44:05.392
Dumped here.

44:05.476 --> 44:09.063
-(beeping)
-Excuse me.

44:09.480 --> 44:13.442
-See who's standing across the street?
-Yeah, I saw him. It's his headquarters.

44:17.655 --> 44:18.989
I am appalled, Frankie,

44:19.073 --> 44:21.241
at how people crowd
around things like this.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.993
We had an understanding, Jesus.
No more violence.

44:23.494 --> 44:25.954
I got a sneaking suspicion
that's the last one.

44:26.038 --> 44:27.289
Until the next one.

44:27.539 --> 44:30.334
Well, you know, Frankie,
I heard some rumors.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.920
I heard all negotiations have finished.

44:33.504 --> 44:37.424
I heard Diablos gave up a block
on all four sides of their turf.

44:37.925 --> 44:41.929
I heard everybody agreed
no more riding in their cars at night.

44:42.012 --> 44:45.265
The six dead stay dead. Nobody joins them.

44:45.974 --> 44:47.476
Only no one could shake on this

44:47.559 --> 44:51.063
on account of one piece
of unfinished business left.

44:51.146 --> 44:56.110
Somebody owes something for the flowers
at the little boy's funeral, <i>tu sabes?</i>

44:56.568 --> 44:58.987
The little boy
that got killed two days ago.

44:59.071 --> 45:02.116
Everybody agreed on that, Furillo.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.410
So, now I think the guy's paid up.

45:05.035 --> 45:08.747
So, I got a sneaking suspicion
there's gonna be peace from now on.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.874
Of course, it's a rumor.

45:12.626 --> 45:15.587
I'm going to investigate this murder
right down the line.

45:15.671 --> 45:18.048
And when we get the people who did it,
they're going to jail.

45:18.966 --> 45:21.135
(speaks Spanish) Good luck, Frank.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.345
Yo, Frank.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.472
Can I offer you a beer?

45:34.648 --> 45:36.400
-(Fay panting)
-HENRY: All right, relax.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.944
-DOCTOR: Almost made it that time.
-(chatter)

45:39.027 --> 45:41.113
-HENRY: Don't forget to breathe.
-FAY: It's starting!

45:41.196 --> 45:42.406
-It's starting.
-DOCTOR: This is it.

45:42.489 --> 45:45.868
-Cleansing breath.
-NURSE: Again. Okay, now push.

45:45.951 --> 45:49.246
-(screaming)
-Harder.

45:49.329 --> 45:50.789
Homestretch, Fay.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.958
-(screaming)
-Okay.

45:53.041 --> 45:55.419
You can do it! You can do it!

45:55.502 --> 45:57.004
A little bit more. A little bit more.

45:57.087 --> 45:59.715
-(screaming)
-I can see it.

45:59.798 --> 46:02.468
-There's the head.
-(screaming)

46:06.013 --> 46:08.140
-And push.
-She's here.

46:10.768 --> 46:12.603
-(baby crying)
-She's here.

46:12.686 --> 46:15.814
-(Fay laughs)
-She's here.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.192
-Oh, yeah.
-Welcome to the city.

46:19.943 --> 46:21.278
Look at her, Fay.

46:21.361 --> 46:24.114
-I did it.
-You did it.

46:25.574 --> 46:26.909
Oh!

46:28.869 --> 46:30.954
Not bad for an old broad.

46:41.381 --> 46:43.842
(woman speaking on PA indistinct)

46:47.054 --> 46:48.931
Seven pounds, seven ounces.

46:49.014 --> 46:54.436
Oh, that's a big baby. That's a big baby.

46:54.520 --> 46:55.979
Everybody's fine.

46:56.063 --> 46:58.690
Oh, that's wonderful.
That's just wonderful.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.192
Here, have a cigar.

47:01.151 --> 47:04.571
-(laughs)
-Have one for tomorrow.

47:05.197 --> 47:07.908
Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

47:08.700 --> 47:10.869
I appreciate everything, Henry.

47:13.914 --> 47:14.832
Yeah.

47:16.959 --> 47:17.918
Good night.

47:23.090 --> 47:24.007
Thank you.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.093
It's a healthy baby girl.

47:26.802 --> 47:28.178
(laughs)

47:30.305 --> 47:31.181
How's Fay?

47:32.850 --> 47:38.105
Henry said she had a little trouble
with the delivery, but she's fine now.

47:42.276 --> 47:43.527
She's brave.

47:45.028 --> 47:46.363
More than sensible.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.076
I was so proud when Frank Jr. was born.

47:54.538 --> 47:56.582
I was still drinking, but it hadn't...

47:59.209 --> 48:01.211
World seemed full of possibilities.

48:06.258 --> 48:08.844
It's still full of possibilities,
pizza man.

48:16.602 --> 48:17.603
(kisses)

48:22.566 --> 48:25.402
(closing theme playing)
