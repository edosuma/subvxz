01:51.200 --> 01:54.100
Uptown, Saturday night.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.400
A hell of a place.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.900
Fucking hillbilly heaven
is what it is.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.200
The hell with this.
Let's go upstairs and get this asshole.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.601
We'll wait for Gates.
These are his people.

02:19.902 --> 02:22.502
- Sorry to take you away from dinner.
- What do you got?

02:22.702 --> 02:25.902
A goddamn hillbilly wacko
tore up two men at a bar.

02:26.302 --> 02:28.202
Took the head off one guy
with a bottle...

02:28.403 --> 02:30.803
...and the other was dead
before he hit the floor.

02:31.103 --> 02:33.903
What the fuck gets into
these people of yours, Gates?

02:34.203 --> 02:38.103
Sometimes folks make us
a mite testy, Zimmer. Got a name?

02:38.603 --> 02:41.304
Willy Simpson.
The manager said you might know him.

02:41.904 --> 02:44.404
Hey, Gates, I'm gonna give you
15 minutes.

02:44.704 --> 02:47.104
Then I'm going in.
I'll put some hair on the wall.

02:47.504 --> 02:49.804
You follow what I'm saying?

02:54.105 --> 02:56.205
- Herman.
- You watch yourself, officer.

02:56.505 --> 02:58.705
Like a junkyard dog.

03:11.106 --> 03:12.706
What kind of shape is he in?

03:12.906 --> 03:16.106
They pulled a knife on him first.
They was messing with his woman.

03:16.406 --> 03:20.707
- I'll see he gets a good lawyer.
- Back home he wouldn't need one.

03:21.007 --> 03:23.607
Well, he should have drove
them home and cut them there.

03:23.807 --> 03:26.707
It would have saved us
a shitload of trouble.

03:49.109 --> 03:50.709
Willy?

03:51.009 --> 03:53.209
It's Truman Gates.

03:53.709 --> 03:56.010
I was wondering
if I could come in and talk.

03:56.310 --> 03:59.710
- Are you alone?
- Yes, sir, I am.

04:00.310 --> 04:02.410
Come on in.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.911
I heard of you.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.112
Your family's from up in
Perry County, ain't they?

04:22.912 --> 04:25.012
Yeah, up near Hazard.

04:26.712 --> 04:28.712
Mind if I sit down?

04:37.013 --> 04:39.413
Damn things ride up on me.

04:49.714 --> 04:51.114
So you wanna watch the TV?

04:57.315 --> 04:58.415
She pissed me off.

05:01.615 --> 05:03.315
You wanna see a doctor?

05:06.015 --> 05:08.816
Shit, man, I've known worse than this.

05:09.216 --> 05:11.316
Where'd that be?

05:11.716 --> 05:14.516
Allegheny Mining Corporation,
Number 3.

05:26.917 --> 05:29.117
Harlan County, yeah?

05:29.717 --> 05:32.617
I used to hunt up there with my brothers
up on Daggots Ridge.

05:33.918 --> 05:36.918
Shit, I know just
where you're talking about.

05:37.518 --> 05:40.618
Hey, there are ghosts up on that ridge.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.818
No kidding?

05:43.918 --> 05:46.519
Yeah. One time my dogs took me
straight down this hollow.

05:47.219 --> 05:49.819
There weren't no wind or nothing.
It just got real cold.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.819
Then all at once, them dogs
started to howl like...

05:59.420 --> 06:02.320
Like they was talking to the dead.

06:03.220 --> 06:05.520
Yeah, man,
there are ghosts up on that ridge.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.320
They're coming for you, Willy.

06:12.321 --> 06:17.021
I know you'll take a couple of them with
you, but they'll get you just the same.

06:18.321 --> 06:21.521
Or we could ride down
to the station together.

06:22.521 --> 06:25.222
Just a couple of fellas from the hills.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.022
You've got my word on that.

06:33.122 --> 06:34.922
I know you ain't scared to die, Willy.

06:36.523 --> 06:39.623
You just ain't in no place
to leave your ghost.

06:43.323 --> 06:44.723
Good work, Truman.

06:46.123 --> 06:48.324
- Lenny, grab him.
- Oh, no. Zimmer.

06:48.624 --> 06:52.024
This piece of shit's Homicide's now, pal!

06:52.624 --> 06:55.324
What are you doing, you asshole?
What are you doing?

06:55.624 --> 07:00.125
Touch my prisoner again, I'll break every
bone in your body. You hear me, huh?

07:00.525 --> 07:02.425
You follow what I'm saying?

07:02.725 --> 07:05.225
Do you follow what I'm saying?

07:41.728 --> 07:44.128
- Hey.
- Hey, brother.

07:44.428 --> 07:46.628
Catch any thieves lately?

07:46.928 --> 07:48.928
Same old, same old.

07:50.229 --> 07:53.829
So, what happened to you the other
night? Jessie and I waited two hours.

07:54.129 --> 07:57.129
I had a late pickup out in Cicero.

07:57.429 --> 08:00.129
I thought we left it loose about dinner.

08:00.529 --> 08:04.330
Hey, no big deal. She only spent half
the day making your favorite dinner.

08:04.530 --> 08:07.230
Tell her I'm sorry.

08:09.130 --> 08:12.530
So you heard from Briar lately?
He still after you to stay clear of me?

08:12.930 --> 08:14.431
Give me a break, Mom.

08:14.631 --> 08:16.731
- "Mom"?
- Yeah.

08:20.231 --> 08:24.231
Are you afraid I'll talk you into staying
here and leaving the mountains behind?

08:24.431 --> 08:26.532
- Well, ain't you?
- Yeah.

08:27.832 --> 08:31.532
You can make your own decisions.
I'm just trying to make things easier.

08:32.232 --> 08:35.832
Bullshit. You're just as bad as Briar.
You're just smoother.

08:36.131 --> 08:39.633
- Now wait a minute, little brother.
- No, you wait a second.

08:41.633 --> 08:45.833
I feel like one of them little countries
stuck between two big superpowers.

08:46.233 --> 08:49.333
Both claim to be helping.
They're just trying to outdo one another.

08:49.733 --> 08:52.434
And I'm the one in the middle
catching all the shit.

08:52.634 --> 08:54.234
The fact is, I don't like it here.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.734
As soon as I earn me enough to put
down on a coal truck, I'm heading home.

08:59.234 --> 09:02.334
Now, that ain't Briar talking. That's me.

09:04.035 --> 09:06.335
Let's go, David.

09:41.938 --> 09:44.538
The string section's wonderful.

09:49.638 --> 09:52.538
Well. What a surprise, you were late.

09:53.839 --> 09:55.439
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

09:55.739 --> 09:58.439
- You was wonderful, from what I heard.
- Thank you.

09:58.739 --> 10:00.139
How was Gerald?

10:02.739 --> 10:05.340
He got another letter from Briar.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.940
I pushed him a little hard...

10:07.140 --> 10:10.640
...so he probably won't speak
to me again for a month or so, but...

10:11.040 --> 10:13.540
Other than that, everything's great.

10:15.140 --> 10:18.841
And he says that I do it
just to get back at Briar.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.541
And he's right. You do.

10:23.241 --> 10:27.741
That's what I love about you, Jessie
darling, the way you sugarcoat things.

10:31.842 --> 10:33.242
Let's get out of here.

10:34.442 --> 10:36.342
George. George,
how's that sister of yours?

10:36.542 --> 10:38.142
Not bad.

10:40.242 --> 10:41.742
Hey, where you been?

10:42.042 --> 10:44.243
- Chasing girls?
- I'm sorry I'm late, PappaJohn.

10:44.543 --> 10:46.843
Gabrielle, forgive me.

10:50.443 --> 10:53.743
You're late. That doesn't matter.
You're here, that's all that counts.

10:57.244 --> 11:01.144
This is a special occasion.

11:02.044 --> 11:03.844
Joey.

11:04.144 --> 11:06.945
I want you to meet
Lawrence lsabella, my son.

11:07.245 --> 11:10.445
Lawrence, Joey Rosselini
I was telling you about.

11:10.745 --> 11:13.345
Lawrence is my son from
my first wife, Sylvia, who died.

11:13.745 --> 11:16.345
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.445
Yeah. Good things, I hope.

11:18.945 --> 11:21.646
- He's been bragging about you.
- Hey.

11:21.946 --> 11:25.146
I've been telling Lawrence
how much he could learn from you.

11:26.046 --> 11:28.146
- Like what?
- Business, Joey.

11:28.546 --> 11:31.947
He wants to go to work for his papa.
I couldn't be prouder.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.647
- Honey?
- What?

11:40.847 --> 11:43.147
Do you believe in the hereafter?

11:43.447 --> 11:47.548
- Then you know what I'm here after.
- Not now. Go away.

12:10.950 --> 12:14.750
- Bravo.
- You wanna play on the teeter-totter?

12:22.151 --> 12:23.951
I love you.

12:24.051 --> 12:27.351
You know what happens
when you say that to a mountain boy?

12:52.653 --> 12:53.853
All right, stay close.

12:54.153 --> 12:56.553
- No problem.
- Let's go.

13:06.454 --> 13:08.654
It's time to teach
these fucking punks a lesson.

13:15.355 --> 13:19.755
Hey, I don't bitch when you listen to
that... What you call it? Rat music.

13:20.155 --> 13:23.356
Rap. Rap, not rat.

13:23.656 --> 13:25.956
You ever try to hum any rat?

13:26.156 --> 13:32.056
Look, homeboy, you don't mix rap and
hum music. They're different flavors.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.357
Okay.

13:50.658 --> 13:52.658
Damn it. We're being pulled over.

13:52.858 --> 13:56.058
That ain't no cop, man. That's a hit.

13:56.358 --> 13:58.158
- What are you doing, Gerald?
- Hold on.

14:11.859 --> 14:12.860
What are you doing?

14:16.460 --> 14:17.960
Gerald. Gerald, stop!

14:25.961 --> 14:27.561
Yeah!

14:32.161 --> 14:33.961
Yeah, boy.

14:37.462 --> 14:39.362
Get them, Paulie.

14:45.162 --> 14:47.462
Gerald, let them have it, man.
It ain't worth it!

14:49.963 --> 14:51.763
- Why isn't he stopping?
- He'll stop.

14:55.063 --> 14:56.963
What the hell is wrong with you?

14:57.863 --> 14:59.063
Stop!

15:11.964 --> 15:13.264
- This guy...
- Holy fuck!

15:24.365 --> 15:27.366
Wait. Wait, wait. Hold it.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.666
Leo, get the door.

15:48.467 --> 15:51.468
Hey, Lawrence, come on.
You wanna learn the family business.

15:51.768 --> 15:54.668
Let me show you how we negotiate.
Come on.

16:06.469 --> 16:10.169
Come on, Lawrence. Come on.
Come on up.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.970
What's wrong with you, huh?

16:22.870 --> 16:23.870
Don't you watch TV?

16:24.670 --> 16:28.071
Don't you know when someone wants
you to pull over and talk to them?

16:29.671 --> 16:30.871
I didn't tell you to get up.

16:34.571 --> 16:35.971
You ain't taking my truck.

16:37.271 --> 16:39.271
"You ain't"?

16:40.071 --> 16:42.172
You're a fucking hillbilly, aren't you?

16:42.472 --> 16:46.472
No wonder you didn't pull over.
You never seen a TV before.

16:51.772 --> 16:53.873
What's your name?

16:54.873 --> 16:55.973
Gerald Gates.

17:01.873 --> 17:03.973
What the fuck is this?

17:16.273 --> 17:17.675
You know, Gerald...

17:17.875 --> 17:19.675
...I've dealt with niggers...

17:19.875 --> 17:23.875
...kikes, Polacks, Chinks, spics.

17:24.275 --> 17:25.575
If God made it, I've seen it.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.475
But you fucking hillbillies,
you are the dumbest I ever met.

17:35.576 --> 17:37.376
Go to hell.

17:37.576 --> 17:40.376
You know, Gerald, I gotta
hand it to you. You got balls.

17:41.576 --> 17:46.477
- Stupid as shit, but major balls.
- Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

18:38.381 --> 18:43.081
The owner of the restaurant asked for
the machine to be removed last night.

18:44.182 --> 18:45.682
It was an outfit setup.

18:48.182 --> 18:51.182
Gerald just happened to be the driver.

18:52.682 --> 18:55.482
God, Truman, I'm sorry.

19:02.783 --> 19:05.583
You act like I was supposed to know
his brother was a cop.

19:05.883 --> 19:09.784
He was a fucking hillbilly. How many
hillbilly cops do you know about, Frank?

19:10.384 --> 19:13.384
PappaJohn, in 40 years,
you ever hear of a hillbilly cop?

19:13.684 --> 19:14.784
I did what I had to do.

19:16.284 --> 19:19.084
It was clean. Am I right, Frank? Clean?

19:22.485 --> 19:25.285
Bottom line is,
did we get what we wanted here?

19:25.585 --> 19:29.085
I'm supposed to meet Northside's
lawyers at 3 to discuss our proposal.

19:30.185 --> 19:32.385
That's good. That's real good.

19:33.386 --> 19:35.786
- Relax, Frank. Quit worrying.
- I'm paid to worry.

19:36.986 --> 19:38.886
Not the first time
you've made me anxious.

19:39.086 --> 19:41.186
You do your job and I'll do mine.

19:41.486 --> 19:43.986
Go home, Frank. Get some sleep.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.587
Good night, Frank.

20:14.889 --> 20:17.889
You shot him in cold blood, Joey.

20:20.689 --> 20:22.890
Did Lawrence tell you that?

20:23.890 --> 20:26.290
PappaJohn,
you gave me two instructions:

20:27.090 --> 20:28.490
Teach him the business...

20:30.290 --> 20:31.790
...and take care of him.

20:38.191 --> 20:39.591
Joey.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.991
Thanks.

21:46.896 --> 21:48.696
Jessie.

21:50.297 --> 21:54.797
You best wait here, hon.
They ain't real quick with strangers.

21:57.297 --> 22:01.398
- I'm your wife.
- No, I ain't talking about you, honey.

22:01.698 --> 22:03.798
I'm talking about me.

22:04.098 --> 22:07.098
- Okay?
- Okay.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.400
- Grandpa.
- Truman.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.400
Briar.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.501
Goddamn it, you're still brothers,
ain't you?

22:42.101 --> 22:43.801
Truman.

22:44.601 --> 22:49.801
- Truman.
- Cousin Hollis. Snake.

22:51.202 --> 22:52.702
- Uncle Pierce.
- Truman.

22:53.002 --> 22:54.902
Cousin Selkirk.

22:55.402 --> 22:58.902
- Uncle De Witt.
- Truman.

23:00.202 --> 23:02.702
Get the fella that killed him?

23:03.603 --> 23:07.503
No, sir, not yet. They're working on it.

23:08.003 --> 23:10.203
Is that your wife?

23:13.003 --> 23:15.103
Her name's Jessie.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.914
I wanna thank you
for being good to Gerald.

25:20.014 --> 25:22.914
His letters, they all said
you made him feel at home.

25:45.816 --> 25:47.216
How'd you and Truman meet?

25:50.216 --> 25:52.016
At a church.

25:52.316 --> 25:55.016
Truman in church?

25:55.816 --> 25:57.917
Actually, he was investigating a robbery.

25:59.617 --> 26:01.617
Truman says you play the fiddle.

26:02.117 --> 26:03.217
I teach violin.

26:05.417 --> 26:07.317
Yeah, you know where it is.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.618
- Would you?
- Now?

26:12.118 --> 26:13.718
Why, sure. While we're waiting.

26:15.518 --> 26:17.118
Sure.

26:20.218 --> 26:22.919
Wait, can I have that?

28:06.927 --> 28:08.027
Come on in.

28:17.528 --> 28:21.828
- What you looking at? It ain't changed.
- Gotten dirtier.

28:23.828 --> 28:27.329
- Got another one of those?
- Refrigerator.

28:29.329 --> 28:34.329
- You get good reception on that dish?
- Only when the TV ain't busted.

28:35.429 --> 28:38.930
- Nice trophy. It ain't season yet, is it?
- Bow season.

28:40.730 --> 28:43.830
Got it about two weeks ago.

28:46.430 --> 28:48.330
Kind of hoping Gerald and me was...

29:12.332 --> 29:13.933
So where's the coal truck?

29:14.233 --> 29:17.833
- Bank took it when the mine shut down.
- When was this?

29:18.233 --> 29:21.833
About the same time Gerald went north.
It kind of makes sense, don't it?

29:24.333 --> 29:27.534
- Briar, he never told me.
- That's because I told him not to.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.734
He wanted me to go, Chicago. Shit.

29:32.934 --> 29:35.734
Not me, brother. I been there
and you can have it.

29:37.034 --> 29:39.335
I wouldn't wanna leave
these accommodations either.

29:39.735 --> 29:42.535
At least it's my place.
I still own the land it sits on.

29:42.835 --> 29:46.935
I can open the door in the middle of
the night and take a piss on it if I want.

29:51.436 --> 29:55.636
Don't worry about paying for the funeral.
I'll take care of it.

29:55.936 --> 30:00.236
Is that what you come down here to talk
to me about, paying for his funeral?

30:00.636 --> 30:02.236
No, it ain't.

30:02.436 --> 30:06.037
Goddamn it, Briar, you act like
it don't bother me about Gerald.

30:07.037 --> 30:11.237
Don't you think I ask myself 100 times
a day what I could have done to stop it?

30:11.537 --> 30:13.237
You tell me what I could have done.

30:13.537 --> 30:17.238
It ain't what you could've done,
it's what's gotta be done!

30:19.838 --> 30:21.638
Briar.

30:28.639 --> 30:30.739
Rosie. Rosie.

30:39.639 --> 30:43.440
- So how are you handling all this?
- Better.

30:52.341 --> 30:56.141
You can do better than that.
Try again.

30:58.641 --> 31:00.841
You're doing pretty good.

31:03.441 --> 31:05.942
My daddy said you used to be good
with a bow and arrow...

31:06.342 --> 31:09.142
...before you went off to the city
and forgot everything.

31:09.342 --> 31:11.142
"Forgot everything"?

31:11.442 --> 31:15.442
I've seen this man shoot a hummingbird
out of the sky at 75 yards.

31:15.642 --> 31:19.543
You ever heard of William Tell? This man
makes William Tell look like a beginner.

31:19.943 --> 31:23.643
- Show us.
- Yeah, show us.

31:24.043 --> 31:27.043
- Sure.
- Come on.

31:28.543 --> 31:31.644
- Why, thank you, darling.
- You're welcome, darling.

31:31.944 --> 31:34.844
You know paybacks are a bitch,
don't you?

31:39.144 --> 31:40.844
Can I borrow this?

31:50.345 --> 31:54.646
Good luck.
I just wanna say good luck.

31:59.046 --> 32:01.046
Oh, my God.

32:02.746 --> 32:05.046
Now your turn.

32:06.247 --> 32:08.247
Lock your arrow.

32:12.647 --> 32:16.147
Now put three fing... Yeah, good.
Put that into first... Yeah, yeah.

32:16.447 --> 32:21.648
Now put that finger up. Keep that finger
down. Let your breath out as you let go.

32:23.148 --> 32:25.848
All right, congratulations.
You just got a 10-point buck.

32:26.048 --> 32:31.349
No, sir. I just killed the man
that shot Uncle Gerald.

32:34.449 --> 32:36.949
Wait up.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.850
It's yours this time, Briar.

32:52.150 --> 32:55.150
And if any mischief follows,
then I shall give...

32:55.450 --> 32:59.751
...an eye for an eye, a tooth
for a tooth, a hand for a hand...

33:00.051 --> 33:02.251
The Chicago police will catch
Gerald's killer...

33:02.551 --> 33:06.251
...but we gotta give them time.
- We know about cities, Truman.

33:06.551 --> 33:08.552
We all either lived in one
or got kin there.

33:08.852 --> 33:10.852
And we knows about
your police there too.

33:11.252 --> 33:14.852
Ask anybody here if your big-city cops
ever cared about us, living or dead.

33:15.152 --> 33:20.052
I'll grant you we ain't perfect,
but we are gonna find Gerald's killer.

33:21.153 --> 33:25.353
And as soon as we make a case,
he is going up for murder one.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.553
Damn it, man! He was our brother.

33:30.253 --> 33:32.253
A life for a life.

33:33.154 --> 33:34.354
- Amen.
- Amen.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.354
Amen.

34:07.656 --> 34:09.757
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:09.956 --> 34:12.357
What case are you working on?

34:12.657 --> 34:15.657
These are some of the boys
that might have killed Gerald.

34:16.056 --> 34:18.757
Why did Tony let you have them?

34:19.757 --> 34:21.657
Homicide's running out of leads.

34:21.857 --> 34:26.158
And they haven't been able to find
David Jenkins, Gerald's friend.

34:26.757 --> 34:29.358
These guys may be the reason.

34:29.658 --> 34:31.958
Did they ask for your help?

34:32.658 --> 34:34.358
No.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.659
Jessie.

34:45.659 --> 34:49.159
If Briar kills one of these men,
they'll kill him.

34:50.460 --> 34:55.159
I've already lost one brother.
I can't lose my other.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.060
No, no. I don't give a fuck
about the dock situation.

34:59.361 --> 35:01.961
As long as lsabella's happy,
everybody's happy.

35:02.161 --> 35:06.061
Hey, Leo, I owe you a fin.
You know that, don't you? Excuse me.

35:09.761 --> 35:10.661
What the hell's that?

35:10.961 --> 35:14.962
Closed-circuit TV for security.
Lawrence is putting it in.

35:15.262 --> 35:17.662
- Lawrence, huh?
- Yup.

35:19.462 --> 35:23.462
- Tell them not to put one in my office.
- Okay.

35:24.063 --> 35:26.663
Hey. Hey.

35:26.863 --> 35:28.163
I ordered a leather sofa.

35:28.963 --> 35:32.963
- You Lawrence lsabella?
- Man, just put it down here. Easy.

35:33.363 --> 35:35.263
No, his office is down there.

35:35.563 --> 35:38.764
This is my office. See?

35:40.364 --> 35:44.464
- What the fuck is this?
- That's good. Right under the painting.

35:44.864 --> 35:48.264
Lawrence, what are you doing?
This is my office.

35:48.865 --> 35:52.265
Come on, Joey, I need the one
by the stairs. I'm here all day.

35:52.865 --> 35:54.665
It's okay. I cleared it with Dad.

35:54.865 --> 35:56.965
Besides, you're never here, so it's...

36:00.365 --> 36:01.866
Hey.

36:12.766 --> 36:14.567
Can I help you?

36:14.867 --> 36:16.767
I need some ID.

36:17.367 --> 36:19.467
All right, go ahead.

36:25.868 --> 36:27.968
This isn't my office.

36:28.168 --> 36:30.868
No fucking way.

36:31.968 --> 36:35.168
It wasn't for me, he wouldn't
be getting to play businessman.

36:35.468 --> 36:36.768
Hey, who are you?

36:38.669 --> 36:41.169
My name's Truman Gates.
I'd like to talk to somebody...

36:41.469 --> 36:44.369
...about that driver who was killed.
He was my brother.

36:49.069 --> 36:51.770
- Now who are you?
- Who am I?

36:52.070 --> 36:53.770
Yeah.

36:55.070 --> 36:56.570
This is Mr. Rosselini.

36:56.870 --> 37:00.470
I'm Lawrence lsabella.
We now operate the business.

37:00.770 --> 37:03.371
Wait. Isabella?

37:03.671 --> 37:07.171
- No, you ain't kin to Johnny lsabella?
- Yeah, he's my father.

37:07.471 --> 37:10.971
No kidding. Well, I'll be danged.

37:11.371 --> 37:13.371
Can we help you?

37:13.671 --> 37:15.672
Yeah, I think maybe you can.

37:18.672 --> 37:21.372
And I'm sure all your employee records
are up-to-date.

37:21.672 --> 37:25.272
I take it the police haven't been able
to locate this David Jenkins.

37:25.672 --> 37:28.373
If you ask me, nobody's looked
in the right place yet.

37:28.673 --> 37:30.473
Maybe he took a vacation.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.774
- I appreciate your help, Mr. Isabella.
- Yeah.

37:41.974 --> 37:44.174
Did you find
what you were looking for?

37:44.474 --> 37:47.574
I don't know yet. We'll see, won't we?

37:58.375 --> 38:00.175
Think he figured out
where Jenkins is?

38:00.575 --> 38:03.875
Well, if he did,
I just gave you a way to find out.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.676
- Lawrence, you handled that real well.
- Thanks.

38:06.976 --> 38:09.176
We might just make a good team.

38:09.476 --> 38:11.776
Tell Leo to get the car.

38:12.476 --> 38:14.976
Yeah, we make a great team, Joey.

39:02.080 --> 39:06.081
- He's taking us to the projects.
- No shit. Shut up and keep with him.

39:35.883 --> 39:40.183
Hey, kid, you see a white guy come
through here a couple of seconds ago?

39:40.583 --> 39:42.083
One fifty-two.

39:42.383 --> 39:44.684
One fifty-two? Okay.

40:01.085 --> 40:03.785
Hey, there ain't no 152.

40:04.085 --> 40:07.585
Hey, look at our fucking car!

40:10.186 --> 40:12.886
- My car!
- Come on, come on.

41:16.391 --> 41:18.591
Sure sounds like a fun place.

41:18.891 --> 41:20.491
Pay me $65 a month.

41:21.391 --> 41:24.692
Forty-two dollars a week, $6.50 a day.

41:25.092 --> 41:27.492
Cash up in front.

41:27.692 --> 41:28.892
No cash, no flop.

41:32.692 --> 41:34.393
Hell...

41:35.193 --> 41:38.493
...I used to pay only 25 for
a whole month's rent back home.

41:40.593 --> 41:42.593
Yeah, well, friend,
you're in Chicago now...

41:42.893 --> 41:46.093
...so you better get used to
those high prices.

42:18.796 --> 42:21.296
You fellers better work on that.

43:24.701 --> 43:25.602
Howdy.

43:27.002 --> 43:29.502
I need to talk to Johnny lsabella.

43:29.702 --> 43:31.602
I heard this is his club.

43:33.802 --> 43:35.502
No?

43:36.902 --> 43:38.403
Okay.

43:45.803 --> 43:48.003
So how you boys doing?

43:49.603 --> 43:52.304
Hey, you ain't gambling, are you?

43:52.504 --> 43:55.304
You don't see no money on the table,
do you?

43:56.204 --> 43:58.204
- What'd he say?
- That we're gambling.

43:58.404 --> 44:00.804
Just a friendly little game, huh?

44:02.605 --> 44:04.305
How we doing?

44:07.305 --> 44:11.105
Good old Vinny. Who's Vinny?

44:13.405 --> 44:15.606
Whoever you are, you're kicking ass.

44:15.906 --> 44:19.806
Of course, it don't mean nothing,
does it? Just for fun, right?

44:20.106 --> 44:21.906
That's right.

44:23.906 --> 44:25.906
Yeah.

44:27.607 --> 44:31.007
- And lsabella ain't here, huh?
- Nope.

44:31.407 --> 44:34.707
And no idea where to find him?

44:36.707 --> 44:39.808
Damn shame because all I wanted to do
was talk to the man.

44:41.808 --> 44:44.708
Hey, I'm John lsabella.
What do you want?

44:57.309 --> 45:00.809
- So, what can I do for you?
- My name is Truman Gates.

45:01.109 --> 45:04.510
I'm the brother of the Northside
employee who was killed August 8.

45:05.510 --> 45:07.710
One week before you took over
the company.

45:08.010 --> 45:13.210
I'm sorry. I didn't know anything
about anyone being killed.

45:14.410 --> 45:17.311
As for my taking over Northside,
that's no big secret.

45:17.711 --> 45:20.811
We've been after George Miller
for five years to let me buy him out.

45:21.211 --> 45:24.311
It was a good deal for both of us too.

45:25.811 --> 45:27.011
Needs oregano.

45:27.311 --> 45:29.412
You should check with George
about all that.

45:29.712 --> 45:32.012
But as for a murder in a truck...

45:32.812 --> 45:35.112
I didn't say anything about a truck.

45:36.612 --> 45:41.012
I must have read about it, something.
I really don't remember.

45:42.013 --> 45:45.613
But if you're insinuating that
I had your brother killed...

45:46.713 --> 45:50.613
Let me make something clear.
I don't operate that way.

45:51.013 --> 45:55.014
To you, I may look like Al Capone
and God knows who. I don't know.

45:55.314 --> 45:57.314
I'm a businessman...

45:57.514 --> 46:00.514
...like any other businessman.
No better, no worse.

46:00.914 --> 46:02.614
And I'll tell you something else.

46:02.814 --> 46:06.315
I don't need to go around killing people
to get what I want.

46:08.215 --> 46:11.015
Let me tell you a story, Mr. Isabella.

46:11.315 --> 46:13.315
Years ago, my uncle
was shot and killed.

46:13.715 --> 46:16.515
His wife was pregnant at the time
and she saw it happen.

46:17.115 --> 46:20.116
But when the sheriff
asked her who did it...

46:20.516 --> 46:23.916
...she just pointed here
and said, "He knows.

46:24.216 --> 46:26.516
And someday he'll settle it. "

46:26.816 --> 46:29.016
And 16 years later, he did.

46:31.017 --> 46:33.017
Good story.

46:38.517 --> 46:39.817
I hope it's not a threat.

46:44.518 --> 46:46.418
I got three counties worth of kin...

46:46.718 --> 46:49.418
...that expect a certain amount
of justice for that death.

46:50.918 --> 46:54.718
I'm just trying to save both of us
a lot of bloodletting.

46:55.118 --> 46:57.619
So, what exactly
do you want from me?

46:58.419 --> 47:01.219
I want you to turn over
the man who did it to the police.

47:03.619 --> 47:07.019
- You serious?
- Yes, sir.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.520
First off,
I didn't have anybody murdered.

47:14.920 --> 47:15.920
But if I did...

47:16.820 --> 47:18.920
...I'd never turn them over
to the police.

47:19.220 --> 47:22.121
I'm real sorry you feel that way,
Mr. Isabella.

47:24.121 --> 47:25.921
Hey, Gates.

47:26.821 --> 47:29.621
I'm truly sorry about your brother.

47:29.921 --> 47:32.322
- Too bad.
- Oh, no, sir.

47:32.622 --> 47:36.822
We ain't seen bad yet. But it's coming.

48:36.827 --> 48:39.027
Don't kill me.

48:49.428 --> 48:53.528
- How'd you know I was out there?
- Smelled you.

48:56.028 --> 48:57.628
God fucking damn!

48:58.128 --> 49:01.029
- You planning on taking on an army?
- Maybe.

49:03.029 --> 49:05.429
- What's your name?
- Harold.

49:05.729 --> 49:07.629
Harold.

49:09.429 --> 49:12.830
- How'd you like to make $20, Harold?
- What I gotta do?

49:14.230 --> 49:16.530
Know how to use a telephone?

49:18.630 --> 49:20.230
Yeah.

49:30.731 --> 49:35.031
<i>If I'm not back by morning, call my kin. </i>

50:23.235 --> 50:25.936
- Hi. No, thank you.
- No?

50:26.236 --> 50:29.836
Look, I'm gonna take this upstairs
to Joey and show it to him, all right?

50:30.236 --> 50:31.536
What?

50:31.736 --> 50:35.436
- That's not a good idea.
- Why? What...?

50:38.837 --> 50:40.437
All right.

50:54.838 --> 50:56.038
What the fuck?

50:56.138 --> 50:59.038
Hey, it got dark.

51:03.639 --> 51:06.639
- I'll be right back. Stay right there.
- Okay.

51:07.039 --> 51:09.139
It's your dime.

51:21.540 --> 51:24.940
- What'd you do, stupid?
- I didn't do nothing. Why blame me?

51:25.240 --> 51:27.841
- I wish you'd break your ankle.
- Hey, fuck you.

51:28.141 --> 51:31.741
Hey, what the fuck is going on down
here? That's what I wanna know.

51:32.141 --> 51:35.841
I don't know, boss. Leo screwed up.

51:36.441 --> 51:38.341
What the fuck happened
to all the lights?

51:38.541 --> 51:42.042
We thought maybe you.

51:43.042 --> 51:45.642
Let's go finish eating. Come on.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.243
Just turn around
and join your buddies.

51:54.343 --> 51:56.543
Real easy like.

51:59.643 --> 52:02.443
Everybody get down on the floor,
face first.

52:02.843 --> 52:04.544
Now!

52:05.244 --> 52:07.444
Trying to rob this place?
You know who owns it?

52:07.744 --> 52:09.644
Johnny lsabella.
That mean anything to you?

52:10.144 --> 52:12.844
It means I got me the right place.
Now, get your butt down.

52:13.144 --> 52:16.345
- Hey, who are you? What do you want?
- Get down, goddamn it.

52:29.546 --> 52:32.146
My name's Briar Gates.

52:32.646 --> 52:34.946
I want the man who killed my brother.

52:37.446 --> 52:39.346
Let's put our thinking caps on, boys.

52:39.846 --> 52:41.547
I don't have all night.

52:46.647 --> 52:49.247
- You son of a...
- Shit!

52:49.747 --> 52:51.247
Fuck!

52:54.448 --> 52:56.848
How's your memory doing now, boys?

52:58.748 --> 53:00.148
Gerald Gates.

53:00.348 --> 53:04.148
- Shot in the back of one of your trucks.
- Nobody knows about your brother.

53:09.849 --> 53:12.049
You just made the worst mistake
of your life!

53:12.349 --> 53:15.249
No, sir. I think you did.

53:18.950 --> 53:20.250
I told you, nothing kinky.

53:20.550 --> 53:21.950
This is kinky!

53:22.750 --> 53:26.250
Since you can't do anything,
I called the cops.

53:28.550 --> 53:30.851
Fair warning, boys.

53:31.951 --> 53:34.751
Till I find out who killed my brother...

53:35.051 --> 53:39.151
...working around here
is just gonna be no fun at all.

53:46.252 --> 53:48.952
He's dead. He is dead!

53:49.652 --> 53:51.552
Look at my suit!

54:13.454 --> 54:16.054
You know how this makes me feel?

54:17.454 --> 54:19.054
This makes me feel foolish!

54:21.655 --> 54:24.555
- You know who did it?
- Yeah.

54:24.955 --> 54:26.655
We know.

54:37.356 --> 54:40.256
Looks like you fellas
had a little trouble.

54:42.956 --> 54:46.157
Yeah. Well, it looks worse
than it really is, Gates.

54:47.657 --> 54:50.757
And that's why you ain't
pressing charges against my brother.

54:51.057 --> 54:53.957
Did I say it was your brother?
Who said it was your brother?

54:59.458 --> 55:01.658
Well, yes, well...

55:01.858 --> 55:06.458
See, the cops asked me what he said
and I said his name was...

55:06.858 --> 55:08.358
Sounded like it.

55:08.558 --> 55:12.159
Couldn't be sure.
It was a misunderstanding.

55:19.759 --> 55:22.260
Briar hates Chinese food.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.760
- It sets him off.
- Yeah, well, like I just said...

55:25.660 --> 55:28.460
...it was a little misunderstanding.
With who, I don't know.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.760
We got it worked out.
Hey, we don't wanna press charges.

55:32.260 --> 55:34.861
You're gonna take care of it, then?

55:35.261 --> 55:38.061
- Yeah, we'll take care of it.
- For your sake, I hope so.

55:38.261 --> 55:41.261
Because you mess with my brother,
you mess with me.

55:54.962 --> 55:57.462
Fucking hillbillies.

55:57.762 --> 55:59.863
- I don't like this, Joey.
- PappaJohn.

56:00.463 --> 56:03.363
They're nothing.
They plow rocks for a living.

56:05.063 --> 56:07.163
Interesting.

56:07.463 --> 56:11.264
The same thing was said
about our own people in Sicily.

56:11.564 --> 56:13.764
Settle this. Now.

56:35.165 --> 56:37.866
Find him. Take care of him.

56:38.166 --> 56:41.666
I don't care if you have to
go through every flophouse in uptown.

56:49.667 --> 56:52.267
Pick it up. Pick it up.

56:52.567 --> 56:55.067
Geez, if you weren't family...

56:55.367 --> 56:56.867
This is fucked, Rhino.

56:57.167 --> 56:59.967
We've been through every
boarding house in five blocks.

57:00.968 --> 57:02.968
He's not here.

57:07.368 --> 57:08.868
He's here.

57:27.170 --> 57:28.670
Pizza delivery for Gates.

57:28.870 --> 57:31.670
See, that's gonna be a problem.
I don't allow no food here.

57:31.870 --> 57:33.370
What's his fucking room number?

58:35.575 --> 58:37.075
Shit!

58:37.475 --> 58:39.376
Paulie!

58:39.576 --> 58:40.776
You son of a bitch!

58:41.176 --> 58:42.776
Paulie!

58:42.976 --> 58:45.976
Get him, you asshole! Get him!

58:46.576 --> 58:48.276
What are you doing?

58:48.776 --> 58:51.076
You fool!

59:25.479 --> 59:28.279
Rhino, come on, get in the car!

59:58.082 --> 59:59.782
Yeah. We got the son of a bitch now.

01:01:01.487 --> 01:01:04.087
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:01:07.488 --> 01:01:09.488
There he is!

01:01:11.488 --> 01:01:13.488
Fuck you.

01:01:13.788 --> 01:01:16.888
Wait! Wait! Wait!

01:01:18.788 --> 01:01:19.989
I'm sorry!

01:01:20.189 --> 01:01:22.489
I'm sorry, Rhino.

01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:26.989
I fucked up. Sorry!

01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:57.292
Well, look who's here.

01:01:57.492 --> 01:02:00.492
Is that what they teach you in Airborne?
Sneaking up on people?

01:02:00.792 --> 01:02:03.292
I thought all you did was
jump out of airplanes.

01:02:03.492 --> 01:02:05.992
They taught me to jump quiet.

01:02:06.692 --> 01:02:08.392
Beer.

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:13.293
I suppose you're taking me in
for busting up that shop, huh?

01:02:13.993 --> 01:02:18.693
Well, totally destroying a place of
business happens to be a crime up here.

01:02:20.093 --> 01:02:21.694
That ain't why I'm taking you in.

01:02:22.094 --> 01:02:25.494
I'm busting you for carrying
a concealed weapon.

01:02:26.094 --> 01:02:29.794
You asshole. I found out more in
two hours than you did in two weeks.

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:32.194
I know who killed Gerald.

01:02:32.494 --> 01:02:33.995
Joey Rosselini.

01:02:34.295 --> 01:02:36.295
If you know,
why ain't you doing something?

01:02:36.495 --> 01:02:40.495
Because, like I told you before,
I need solid proof so he won't get off.

01:02:40.895 --> 01:02:42.595
I'll fix it so he won't get off.

01:02:43.795 --> 01:02:45.695
That's why I'm taking you in.

01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:26.699
Get up, big brother.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.200
This is better than television.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:49.101
You... You ain't one of us no more.

01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:52.301
You might talk mountain
and fight mountain...

01:03:52.601 --> 01:03:55.501
...but in your heart,
you ain't family no more.

01:03:55.701 --> 01:03:59.001
You're just a cop
that came from the hills.

01:04:53.406 --> 01:04:55.406
Jessie. Jessie?

01:04:59.406 --> 01:05:01.106
Hey.

01:05:01.406 --> 01:05:04.607
What are you...?
What are you doing here?

01:05:05.407 --> 01:05:07.407
What?

01:05:08.607 --> 01:05:11.607
You got accepted to
the Chicago Symphony?

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:14.708
No? No, that's not it?

01:05:15.108 --> 01:05:17.208
Well, then what?

01:05:20.508 --> 01:05:22.508
No.

01:05:24.908 --> 01:05:26.008
Yes?

01:05:26.208 --> 01:05:29.309
Yes? You're serious?

01:05:36.209 --> 01:05:38.809
Is it true, really?

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:42.510
Can I...? Is it okay to touch it?

01:05:42.810 --> 01:05:45.410
- It's down here.
- Oh, yeah.

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:52.511
I love you.

01:06:08.412 --> 01:06:09.712
I got a deal for you.

01:06:10.312 --> 01:06:14.012
First, I wanna know everything
that was in Gerald's letters.

01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.613
Pure and simple, it's like this.

01:06:17.813 --> 01:06:21.813
Anything you have that might help us
catch Joey Rosselini, you share with me.

01:06:22.213 --> 01:06:25.513
We find him, we turn him over
to stand trial.

01:06:26.813 --> 01:06:29.414
What I need from you
is to help me find David Jenkins.

01:06:29.714 --> 01:06:34.314
He was with Gerald when he was killed.
I'm betting on the fact that he saw it.

01:06:35.914 --> 01:06:39.714
If I don't agree, you're gonna take me
back to lockup? That's your deal?

01:06:40.014 --> 01:06:41.915
That's my deal.

01:06:42.115 --> 01:06:46.615
Take me back to jail, then.
We both know who killed Gerald.

01:06:47.015 --> 01:06:49.615
When I get out, I'll settle it.

01:06:50.815 --> 01:06:54.116
Okay, if that's the way you want it.

01:06:58.516 --> 01:07:01.316
But while you're sitting down there
waiting on your butt...

01:07:01.616 --> 01:07:06.217
...I'm gonna find the proof on Rosselini
and I'm gonna put him away myself.

01:07:08.117 --> 01:07:11.517
What if this here Rosselini feller
should take another shot at me?

01:07:11.917 --> 01:07:14.717
Am I supposed to stand around
with my hands in my pockets?

01:07:16.717 --> 01:07:17.918
Well, I sure as hell ain't.

01:07:22.018 --> 01:07:23.918
Got a deal?

01:07:24.518 --> 01:07:26.418
I guess we got a deal.

01:07:41.719 --> 01:07:44.320
You sure this is the place?

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.920
That's the place, all right.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:49.520
Just like he wrote me.

01:08:10.222 --> 01:08:12.722
- What can I get you?
- Two Old Styles on draft.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.922
Draft, hell. I want a bottle.

01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:17.921
You would.

01:08:18.221 --> 01:08:20.023
Two bottles and a little information.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:25.423
You know a guy by the name of
David Jenkins? Comes here a lot.

01:08:26.923 --> 01:08:28.923
- You still want your beers?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:54.825
Thank you.

01:08:55.125 --> 01:08:57.026
The preacher wants to talk to you.

01:08:57.326 --> 01:08:59.326
The preacher?

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:01.426
Now.

01:09:02.926 --> 01:09:05.526
I never say no to a man of the cloth.

01:09:06.126 --> 01:09:07.826
Briar.

01:09:08.126 --> 01:09:10.426
- This fella wants us to follow him.
- Not me!

01:09:11.327 --> 01:09:13.027
Look out!

01:09:13.527 --> 01:09:15.527
You sons of...

01:09:18.527 --> 01:09:20.727
You won't believe this,
but we don't want trouble.

01:09:21.127 --> 01:09:23.928
All we wanna know
is where to find David Jenkins.

01:09:30.728 --> 01:09:33.028
Who is it wants to know?

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:36.729
Truman and Briar Gates,
Gerald Gates' brothers.

01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:39.328
You've come to the wrong place.

01:09:39.529 --> 01:09:41.429
No, they didn't.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.330
- Are you David Jenkins?
- Yeah.

01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:51.930
Can we talk to you outside?

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.130
Come on.

01:10:43.934 --> 01:10:45.934
I'd like to show you some photographs.

01:10:46.234 --> 01:10:49.235
I can look at your pictures,
but I didn't see anything, okay?

01:10:50.135 --> 01:10:53.235
You know, you're just as dumb
as he was.

01:10:53.535 --> 01:10:58.035
I told him to pull over,
let them take what they wanted...

01:10:58.935 --> 01:11:01.036
...but he wouldn't listen.

01:11:02.536 --> 01:11:05.236
You keep pushing this thing,
you'll wind up the same way.

01:11:06.036 --> 01:11:09.236
These are bad people.
You don't mess with them.

01:11:09.636 --> 01:11:12.036
David, you can't hide from them.
They'll get you.

01:11:12.337 --> 01:11:13.537
Mister.

01:11:14.137 --> 01:11:16.937
If you're the same feller
that Gerald wrote me about...

01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:20.537
...you're gonna hate yourself for
a long time for not looking at these.

01:11:24.938 --> 01:11:27.138
You recognize either of these two?

01:11:29.338 --> 01:11:31.538
Yeah. They were there.

01:11:31.738 --> 01:11:33.838
- Now, were they in the truck with him?
- No.

01:11:35.638 --> 01:11:37.339
And him.

01:11:38.439 --> 01:11:40.939
- In the truck?
- Yeah.

01:11:43.539 --> 01:11:45.639
And him. Two in the truck.

01:11:46.139 --> 01:11:47.939
Are you sure?

01:11:48.639 --> 01:11:50.340
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:55.740
Man, if Gerald could see
the two of you...

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.140
Stay out.

01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:04.241
I say we go to
the vending company now...

01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:06.741
...and get them while
they're not expecting it.

01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:08.641
This ain't Kentucky, Briar.

01:12:08.941 --> 01:12:12.741
And the deal was if we found them,
we let the cops deal with them.

01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:15.742
And right now,
we're only halfway there.

01:12:19.442 --> 01:12:21.442
How's it feel?

01:12:22.342 --> 01:12:24.942
A little bit like I was
hit head-on by a coal truck.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.643
Hey, remember the time...

01:12:28.843 --> 01:12:32.543
...I took Betty Jean to the movies
and you thought she was your girl?

01:12:32.943 --> 01:12:36.343
- She was, damn it.
- Bullshit.

01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:38.644
And we duked it out
until 3 in the morning.

01:12:38.944 --> 01:12:40.344
Yeah.

01:12:40.644 --> 01:12:43.044
- That was a bad one, all right.
- Yeah.

01:12:43.344 --> 01:12:46.144
Betty Jean.
Man, you should see her today.

01:12:46.344 --> 01:12:47.644
A real scuzzbucket.

01:12:47.844 --> 01:12:50.144
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:12:50.444 --> 01:12:53.245
Hard to believe we had a fight
over the likes of her.

01:12:53.745 --> 01:12:55.345
We had some doozies.

01:13:02.245 --> 01:13:06.246
- Yeah, we made a mean pair too.
- Yeah.

01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:10.346
It weren't the same after you left.

01:13:14.646 --> 01:13:17.347
I'm gonna be a father, Briar.

01:13:20.347 --> 01:13:22.047
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:27.547
A kid? Goddamn.

01:13:27.947 --> 01:13:30.348
- A little nephew, huh?
- Uncle Briar.

01:13:30.748 --> 01:13:33.448
Uncle Briar. Yeah.

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:41.249
I appreciate you
letting me stay here tonight.

01:13:44.649 --> 01:13:47.449
I have to tell you,
I think what you're doing is wrong.

01:13:47.649 --> 01:13:50.949
You're welcome to stay as long
as you're in town, just like Gerald...

01:13:51.449 --> 01:13:53.050
...but this is my home...

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:56.250
...and my family. And anything
you do that threatens that...

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:59.850
...is gonna make you unwelcome here.
Okay?

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:01.950
Good night.

01:14:18.452 --> 01:14:20.152
Truman?

01:14:22.452 --> 01:14:23.652
Truman?

01:14:23.852 --> 01:14:27.052
Where is he? I told him
to wake me early.

01:14:27.352 --> 01:14:30.153
I'm sorry. I'll be right back, okay?

01:14:32.053 --> 01:14:33.953
- Where is he, Jessie?
- He's at work.

01:14:35.253 --> 01:14:38.253
The hell he is. He went after
those sons of bitches without me.

01:14:38.553 --> 01:14:41.953
Without you? Went after who?
What are you talking about?

01:14:42.354 --> 01:14:46.354
Last night we found out who
killed Gerald. Didn't he tell you?

01:14:46.754 --> 01:14:48.754
We made a deal.
I help him find the killers...

01:14:49.054 --> 01:14:51.054
...he keeps me with him
till we catch them.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:52.854
But he lied to me.

01:14:53.054 --> 01:14:55.455
He planned to get them by himself
the whole time.

01:15:08.056 --> 01:15:10.856
- Hey, Julie.
- Good morning, Mr. Isabella.

01:15:11.956 --> 01:15:14.156
- Have fun.
- Hi.

01:15:21.857 --> 01:15:24.857
Could I get some coffee? Thanks.

01:15:25.557 --> 01:15:27.257
Good morning.

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:29.657
Good morning.

01:15:30.957 --> 01:15:32.458
How's this for a headline?

01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.958
"Chicago Mobster's Son
Indicted for Murder. "

01:15:37.558 --> 01:15:40.158
Don't worry, Lawrence. Nobody's here.

01:15:42.358 --> 01:15:45.159
- I haven't done anything illegal.
- Oh, really?

01:15:46.559 --> 01:15:50.659
Well, I had an interesting talk with
a fella last night who claims different.

01:15:51.259 --> 01:15:55.159
My man said you were in the back
of the truck when my brother was killed.

01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.560
- That's good.
- Enjoy.

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:04.960
Why not bring him in
if he saw everything?

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.861
Oh, I will. Unfortunately for you, it's
enough to put you away for murder.

01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:13.761
Even if you were
just standing around in there.

01:16:14.061 --> 01:16:17.361
- That's the law.
- That's...

01:16:18.861 --> 01:16:21.262
I don't want you, Lawrence.
You know who I want.

01:16:21.562 --> 01:16:26.462
I want the man who pulled the trigger.
I want the man you saw do it.

01:16:27.562 --> 01:16:30.362
No. No.

01:16:31.062 --> 01:16:33.062
- He doesn't have the money.
<i>- I don 't care. </i>

01:16:33.363 --> 01:16:36.463
Irene, he doesn't have the money.
Look, Irene...

01:16:36.863 --> 01:16:40.363
I gotta call you back. Lawrence?
Yo.

01:16:42.963 --> 01:16:44.763
What's the matter? You look like shit.

01:16:45.263 --> 01:16:49.864
Hey, talk to me.
Think of me as your brother.

01:16:55.964 --> 01:16:59.165
Perfect. That's all for today.

01:17:23.967 --> 01:17:26.467
I'll see you next week. All right?

01:17:30.667 --> 01:17:31.867
Hey, Jessie.

01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:50.369
Gates.

01:17:51.269 --> 01:17:53.269
Jessie? Jessie, what's wrong, honey?

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:56.469
Somebody threw red paint in my face.

01:17:57.069 --> 01:17:58.069
<i>They knew my name... </i>

01:17:58.269 --> 01:17:59.970
...and they were waiting for me.

01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:01.870
Stay inside, I'll be right there.

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:04.470
- I can't get it out of my eyes.
- Just stay there.

01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:07.070
<i>Listen to me, Jessie... </i>

01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:11.970
Relax, Lawrence.
Everything's taken care of.

01:18:12.371 --> 01:18:14.671
Well, what if it doesn't work?

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:18.671
Well, that's what we're gonna
go check on right now.

01:18:20.371 --> 01:18:23.371
See, your father taught me something
early on:

01:18:24.071 --> 01:18:26.772
Don't leave anything to chance.

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:31.172
Rhino.

01:18:31.372 --> 01:18:33.172
Bring me the hillbilly's shotgun.

01:19:32.077 --> 01:19:33.777
Jessie?

01:19:34.077 --> 01:19:35.977
Jessie?

01:19:46.378 --> 01:19:48.378
Jessie?

01:19:50.979 --> 01:19:52.579
Jessie?

01:19:54.079 --> 01:19:55.979
Jessie?

01:19:59.979 --> 01:20:01.679
Jessie?

01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:09.580
What are you doing? Stop it!
Okay?

01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:14.380
- Listen to me.
- You lied to me.

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.981
- I didn't lie to you, Jessie.
- You didn't tell me everything.

01:20:18.281 --> 01:20:21.081
- Come here. Come here, baby.
- What's going on?

01:20:21.481 --> 01:20:24.481
- Come here. Come here.
- What's going on?

01:20:28.682 --> 01:20:31.082
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:20:36.682 --> 01:20:39.482
Briar, I tried to stop them
but there was nothing I could do.

01:20:39.782 --> 01:20:41.883
- Shit!
- Who are they?

01:20:43.683 --> 01:20:45.183
What's going on?

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:48.683
I left it like they left it.
I haven't touched a thing.

01:20:48.983 --> 01:20:50.883
Honest.

01:20:53.884 --> 01:20:57.084
- When'd they find them?
- Last night.

01:20:57.384 --> 01:20:59.784
- You got a gun?
- Me? Hell, no.

01:21:00.084 --> 01:21:02.384
I'd shoot somebody.

01:21:08.485 --> 01:21:10.585
You come to pay me?

01:21:11.685 --> 01:21:14.885
- I'll give you $ 100 for your gun.
- I'll take the $ 100. Down payment.

01:21:15.185 --> 01:21:16.385
- I'm in a hurry.
- Look...

01:21:16.685 --> 01:21:21.586
...this is a peaceful bar. We don't need
you or guns to keep order around here.

01:21:25.486 --> 01:21:28.086
- Say what?
- You heard me.

01:21:30.187 --> 01:21:32.287
Your gun, Jack.

01:21:34.387 --> 01:21:38.787
Come on. Will you take it easy?
I'll show you where the fucking...

01:21:39.187 --> 01:21:42.188
Where? Open your fucking mouth!
Where?

01:21:45.288 --> 01:21:46.888
A beer.

01:21:50.088 --> 01:21:51.888
I'll get you one.

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:57.889
- Yeah, fill me up, would you, buddy?
- Yup.

01:22:00.589 --> 01:22:02.689
There you go.

01:22:04.089 --> 01:22:06.790
You have a good day now, you hear?

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:11.890
<i>Two-three-four-two. </i>

01:22:13.190 --> 01:22:14.490
Two-three-four-two.

01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:18.190
<i>All units stand by. Go ahead, 2342.</i>

01:22:18.490 --> 01:22:23.191
Yeah, request a mobile relay
with car 5675.

01:22:30.491 --> 01:22:33.792
<i>Fifty-six, 75, Code 1.</i>

01:22:35.092 --> 01:22:37.692
<i>Go ahead, 5675.</i>

01:22:37.992 --> 01:22:42.292
Five-six-seven-five, this is Antonelli.
Truman, I've been trying to reach you.

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:45.193
Tony, did you get Lawrence lsabella?

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.493
<i>Did I get him? Yeah, I got him. </i>

01:22:48.393 --> 01:22:50.693
Somebody whacked him.

01:22:51.593 --> 01:22:54.093
After they tortured him.

01:22:58.994 --> 01:23:00.694
<i>Who did it? </i>

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:03.294
I think it was your brother.

01:23:10.595 --> 01:23:12.695
He never had a chance.

01:23:12.995 --> 01:23:15.095
They ambushed him.

01:23:16.195 --> 01:23:19.295
By the time I got back,
they were gone.

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:21.996
We found the gun.

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:28.596
These people are animals.
They don't give a fuck about anybody.

01:23:28.896 --> 01:23:30.196
PappaJohn...

01:23:30.496 --> 01:23:33.797
...just give me the chance
to take care of it, please.

01:23:34.197 --> 01:23:35.997
For Lawrence's sake.

01:23:39.297 --> 01:23:41.497
John, I just heard.

01:23:41.797 --> 01:23:45.197
- I made some calls.
- Who did it, Frank?

01:23:45.498 --> 01:23:49.198
We only know he was killed with
a 12-gauge shotgun at close range.

01:23:49.598 --> 01:23:52.698
If this is the hillbilly's gun,
give it to the police.

01:23:52.998 --> 01:23:55.498
With it, they can close the case.
They have a suspect.

01:23:55.798 --> 01:23:57.198
No!

01:24:00.999 --> 01:24:03.799
You, Joey. You kill them.
You kill them.

01:24:04.199 --> 01:24:05.999
You kill them, Joey.

01:24:07.099 --> 01:24:09.099
Harold? Harold.

01:24:09.399 --> 01:24:14.200
You missed him, Truman. He stormed
out of here about an hour ago.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.800
Requesting backup,
Lake Michigan Vending.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.601
Sangiman and Hubbard.

01:24:22.901 --> 01:24:25.701
You got that? Sangiman and Hubbard.

01:24:28.801 --> 01:24:30.501
Briar.

01:24:57.503 --> 01:25:01.504
Lawrence, you little prick.
This wasn't such a bad idea after all.

01:25:06.704 --> 01:25:07.704
<i>- Boss... </i>
<i>- Come here. </i>

01:25:08.004 --> 01:25:10.104
<i>I wanna show you something. </i>
<i>I got a present. </i>

01:25:11.304 --> 01:25:12.205
<i>Jesus Christ. </i>

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:19.505
We got him.

01:25:50.108 --> 01:25:51.808
- Fuck.
- Sleepy time, Gates.

01:25:58.808 --> 01:26:01.509
Come on, Joey, the cops are here.
Come on!

01:26:06.409 --> 01:26:08.709
<i>One-three-L-22, stand by. </i>

01:26:09.009 --> 01:26:10.909
Briar!

01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:12.209
Briar!

01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:25.510
Briar?

01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:32.211
Briar?

01:26:46.912 --> 01:26:49.312
I should have waited for you.

01:26:50.212 --> 01:26:53.513
We could have whupped them together.

01:26:55.613 --> 01:26:57.413
Briar.

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:01.013
I'm at the Lake Michigan
Vending Company...

01:27:01.213 --> 01:27:05.714
...which earlier tonight was
the scene of three deaths.

01:27:06.014 --> 01:27:09.714
Truman. Look...

01:27:10.314 --> 01:27:15.014
...they got breaking and entering,
assault with a deadly weapon, murder.

01:27:15.415 --> 01:27:16.815
It was a setup, Tony.

01:27:17.115 --> 01:27:20.115
I know it was a setup!
You know it was a setup!

01:27:20.415 --> 01:27:23.015
Rosselini knows it was a setup!
But just knowing...

01:27:23.315 --> 01:27:25.215
...doesn't change anything.

01:27:29.216 --> 01:27:31.816
Yeah, it does.

01:27:57.318 --> 01:28:00.818
Hey, Harold, check out Channel 3.

01:28:02.618 --> 01:28:06.219
<i>Burglarizing the premises, an unidentified</i>
<i>man killed two company employees... </i>

01:28:06.619 --> 01:28:08.819
<i>... before being cut down</i>
<i>by security guards. </i>

01:28:09.119 --> 01:28:13.319
<i>John Isabella, reputedly well-connected</i>
<i>to members of Chicago organized crime... </i>

<i>... after an employee of the former owners</i>

Hollis Gates.

<i>My name is Harold, </i>
<i>from the Wooden Nickel. </i>

01:28:36.121 --> 01:28:39.721
Anyway, I'm a friend of Briar Gates.

01:28:40.321 --> 01:28:44.422
He asked me to call you in the case
that something happened to him.

01:28:44.822 --> 01:28:48.122
<i>Well, he was shot last night. </i>
<i>I got his things here. </i>

01:28:48.422 --> 01:28:52.622
<i>- I'm at Broadway and Wilson. </i>
- I appreciate it, friend.

01:29:01.323 --> 01:29:05.223
Rosie. Rosie, we're going on a trip.

01:29:05.523 --> 01:29:09.724
Yes, my love. Yes, my love.

01:29:44.527 --> 01:29:47.527
I got room for a couple with me.

01:29:47.827 --> 01:29:50.127
Hell, no.

01:29:58.828 --> 01:30:00.828
- Howdy, Truman.
- Harold.

01:30:01.028 --> 01:30:03.928
I got all his stuff here for you.

01:30:11.429 --> 01:30:13.329
I'm sorry.

01:30:19.529 --> 01:30:21.430
What are you gonna do?

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:24.430
- I figured I'd do a little hunting.
- Where?

01:30:24.730 --> 01:30:26.430
The cemetery.

01:30:35.731 --> 01:30:37.331
Joey likes to brag.

01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:41.631
And I wanna hear him brag.

01:30:53.332 --> 01:30:54.832
Paulie.

01:30:59.333 --> 01:31:01.733
So then he starts begging.

01:31:03.033 --> 01:31:06.433
I had to laugh. "Please, Joey, please. "

01:31:07.233 --> 01:31:10.034
Finally I just said "fuck it"
and shot him.

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:15.934
You know, boys,
I'm gonna miss this part of the job.

01:31:34.135 --> 01:31:36.336
Come here, Leo.

01:31:56.637 --> 01:31:58.037
Holy shit! Leo!

01:32:00.738 --> 01:32:02.738
Are you okay?
What the fuck happened?

01:32:03.038 --> 01:32:04.638
It was Gates.

01:32:04.838 --> 01:32:07.138
He wants you to meet him.

01:32:10.438 --> 01:32:11.639
That hurt.

01:32:20.239 --> 01:32:22.039
Anywhere he wants!

01:32:22.339 --> 01:32:25.540
Any fucking place he wants!

01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:29.340
Frank.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:32.140
About Joey.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.640
He's been bragging.

01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.241
Right. Tell PappaJohn...

01:33:24.044 --> 01:33:25.444
I don't like this, Joey.

01:33:26.245 --> 01:33:27.445
What's the matter, Leo?

01:33:27.645 --> 01:33:30.745
Didn't you ever play in a cemetery
when you were a kid?

01:33:31.545 --> 01:33:34.145
Relax. I don't plan to be here all night.

01:33:41.046 --> 01:33:42.846
Hey.

01:33:44.646 --> 01:33:46.646
Frank, go down the end there,
turn right...

01:33:46.946 --> 01:33:49.046
...park the car, come back towards me.
Okay?

01:33:49.346 --> 01:33:51.347
Okay, Joey.

01:33:59.347 --> 01:34:00.947
You Harold?

01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:43.351
They love you.

01:34:50.251 --> 01:34:53.652
This is it, Joey. At the veiled lady.

01:35:02.852 --> 01:35:04.853
Rhino, go over there.

01:35:05.053 --> 01:35:07.953
Leo. Paulie.

01:35:09.753 --> 01:35:13.353
Go find Rhino. Stick with him.
You guys, over there, trees.

01:35:17.254 --> 01:35:21.154
Okay, Gates! I'm here!

01:35:23.854 --> 01:35:26.754
Yo, Gates, I thought
you were the smart one!

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:30.155
But I guess you gotta make
the same mistake as your brothers.

01:35:30.355 --> 01:35:32.055
It's your mistake, Rosselini.

01:35:32.555 --> 01:35:35.355
When you set up my brother,
you forgot to kill me.

01:35:35.655 --> 01:35:37.755
That's why I'm here.

01:36:07.058 --> 01:36:08.458
He's gone.

01:36:08.758 --> 01:36:11.358
- I could swear I hit him!
- Where the fuck did he go?

01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.260
Fuck! A fucking arrow.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:43.661
The son of a bitch wants a war?
We'll give him a war!

01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:49.661
Yo.

01:36:53.161 --> 01:36:54.961
Damn!

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.863
Spread out. Find him.

01:37:57.567 --> 01:38:00.067
Time to pack it in, redneck.

01:38:11.968 --> 01:38:14.068
What the fuck is that?

01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:44.670
What the fuck are we waiting for?
Let's nail him and get out of here.

01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:48.971
Hey, if you're so fucking brave,
why don't you go get him yourself?

01:38:55.371 --> 01:38:57.571
Piece of cake.

01:39:32.874 --> 01:39:34.574
Boy, I'm glad to see you guys.

01:39:37.675 --> 01:39:39.675
Just tell us
where you want us, Truman.

01:39:50.876 --> 01:39:54.276
Go get him, boy.
Go on! Go get him, dogs!

01:40:30.379 --> 01:40:32.679
Fuck!

01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:42.580
Good dog. Good dog. Okay.

01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:44.780
Okay, you found me,
now go away. Go away.

01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:32.884
Get up. Get up.

01:42:01.686 --> 01:42:02.886
You don't have a prayer!

01:42:04.086 --> 01:42:05.287
Gates!

01:42:05.687 --> 01:42:07.387
Let him go.

01:42:07.587 --> 01:42:09.087
It's too late, lsabella.

01:42:10.887 --> 01:42:13.087
It's never too late.

01:42:13.387 --> 01:42:15.087
Truman.

01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:42.190
Time to end it.

01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:46.190
Move away, Joey.

01:43:00.991 --> 01:43:02.191
PappaJohn.

01:43:02.391 --> 01:43:05.291
- What are you doing?
- This is for killing my son.

01:43:24.793 --> 01:43:27.593
I believe this was your brother's.

01:43:32.394 --> 01:43:35.694
- It is over between our families, no?
- Yes.

01:43:41.594 --> 01:43:43.495
It's done.

01:44:20.998 --> 01:44:23.398
Don't ever scare me like that again.

01:44:28.698 --> 01:44:29.898
What about Briar?

01:44:32.298 --> 01:44:34.199
Oh, God.

01:44:35.699 --> 01:44:38.799
- I'm so sorry.
- You're my family, Jessie.

01:44:40.499 --> 01:44:42.599
You and the baby.

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:46.600
Come on.
