WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:02.915
I serve as an equalizer.

00:02.959 --> 00:05.614
I'm the one you call
when you can't call 911.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.311
Previously onThe Equalizer...

00:07.355 --> 00:09.661
Does the name Mason Quinn
mean anything to you?

00:09.705 --> 00:11.359
People that tangle with Quinn
end up dead.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.664
Bishop!

00:12.708 --> 00:14.188
Don't come for me again,

00:14.231 --> 00:15.972
because then I'll have
to come after you.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.322
Everyone needs help with
the kind of secrets we carry.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.107
And we can't just talk
to anyone.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.457
They need to be someone
in my community.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.980
Robyn, I need to know that

00:24.024 --> 00:25.590
you're not putting
my daughter at risk.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.636
How much does Delilah
really know about you?

00:27.679 --> 00:29.029
Dad called.

00:29.072 --> 00:31.031
He wants to know
if she feels safe

00:31.074 --> 00:32.684
in this house.

00:32.728 --> 00:35.035
Lies can be necessary
to protect your family,

00:35.078 --> 00:36.384
but they can backfire on you.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.342
They can hurt you
and those around you

00:38.386 --> 00:39.648
in ways you'd never anticipate.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.493
That was taken by Mossad
two days ago in Sevastopol.

00:58.536 --> 00:59.885
Sevastopol?

00:59.929 --> 01:02.018
What is Mason Quinn doing
in Sevastopol?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.672
And who's this guy
he's talking to?

01:03.715 --> 01:04.847
That's Omar Delgado.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.196
Former Cuban intelligence.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.632
Right after meeting
with Quinn,

01:07.676 --> 01:10.461
our sources say he
infiltrated the U.S.

01:10.505 --> 01:13.464
McCall, we've been friends
a long time.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.510
This path you're walking down

01:15.553 --> 01:17.512
ends in darkness.

01:17.555 --> 01:19.818
It always ends
in darkness, Arieh.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.082
That's where the monsters live.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.449
Hey, Mom.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.103
Hey.

01:43.146 --> 01:44.974
I just wanted to let you know
I was back home.

01:45.017 --> 01:46.280
How'd things go at your dad's?

01:49.065 --> 01:52.024
Uh, it was fine.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.462
He ask you any questions
about me?

01:54.505 --> 01:56.159
What I'm up to?

01:56.203 --> 01:58.857
Yeah, but I handled it.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.077
It's no biggie.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.167
You sure you're okay?

02:04.211 --> 02:05.603
You know you can talk to me.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.084
Yeah, I know.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.739
I just, uh... I just wanted
to tell you I was back

02:10.782 --> 02:12.654
and say good night.

02:12.697 --> 02:15.222
So good night.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.675
My sister Calista.

02:33.718 --> 02:35.111
She moved up here
from Baton Rouge

02:35.155 --> 02:36.808
a few years back
to break into journalism.

02:36.852 --> 02:40.203
Your message said
she was in danger.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.205
Well, I've been trying to find
her for the past few days.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.815
When I couldn't, I came
up here to look for her.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.122
Not in her apartment,
not at work.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.124
So you think someone's
trying to kill her?
Yes.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.474
Man with a scar on his face.

02:50.518 --> 02:53.564
You know him?
No.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.567
Well, why do you think
he's after her?
I don't know.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.308
Well, what does your sister say?

02:58.352 --> 02:59.614
Why does it matter
what she says?

02:59.657 --> 03:00.745
She's out there.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.573
She could--

03:02.617 --> 03:04.227
she could be dead already.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.143
I'm just looking for
something to go on.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.797
When is the last time
you spoke to your sister?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.233
That doesn't matter.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.496
It matters if you want my help.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.151
A year ago.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.413
A year ago? So how could you

03:16.457 --> 03:17.588
possibly know she's in trouble?

03:17.632 --> 03:20.374
Because I see things.

03:22.767 --> 03:26.771
Visions of images
that become real.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.644
And I know how that sounds,
but I am not crazy.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.167
It started when I was
six years old.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.299
My parents were going
to the movies.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.475
Before they leave, I just,
I knew.

03:34.518 --> 03:38.218
I saw my mother crying.
I saw my father...

03:38.261 --> 03:40.089
laying on the ground, bleeding.

03:40.132 --> 03:44.006
And I beg 'em to stay at home,
but nobody listens to me.

03:44.049 --> 03:46.661
They were shot and killed
in a robbery that night.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.667
That's a terrible trauma
at any age.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.800
But at six... Are you sure...

03:55.844 --> 03:58.325
It wasn't my imagination?
Or a false memory, right?

03:58.368 --> 04:01.763
No. No!
I know what I saw.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.505
And I couldn't do anything
to stop it.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.768
When we go into foster care,
me and Calista,

04:06.811 --> 04:09.597
the visions continued;
car accidents, deaths.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.338
And I couldn't do anything
to stop it then.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.644
See, no one wanted to hear me.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.864
So I learned...

04:15.907 --> 04:17.779
keep my mouth shut.

04:17.822 --> 04:21.261
Stave off the visions
with various medications.

04:21.304 --> 04:24.307
But when it comes
to my family...

04:24.351 --> 04:28.050
The visions of Calista
were so real,

04:28.093 --> 04:29.399
I couldn't keep those out.

04:29.443 --> 04:33.011
Please, please help me find her

04:33.055 --> 04:34.665
before it's too late.

04:34.709 --> 04:39.496
With your sister,
what, exactly, did you see?

04:43.152 --> 04:46.460
I saw an orange glow,
a silver Mercedes,

04:46.503 --> 04:49.506
a man with a scar,

04:49.550 --> 04:51.116
Calista.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.598
She's so scared.
She's got a gun in her face.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.208
She screams.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.601
I see.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.344
You don't believe me.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.651
I didn't say that.You didn't have to.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.958
Do you have anything else
suggesting she's in danger?

05:07.002 --> 05:08.960
An email, a text...

05:09.004 --> 05:10.440
I hoped you would
be different...

05:12.007 --> 05:14.488
...but you're just like
everybody else.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.361
Hang on, where you going?

05:18.405 --> 05:19.971
I already lost my parents; I'm
not gonna lose my sister, too.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.498
Calista Thibideaux, 29.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.500
Currently employed as
a lifestyle journalist

05:26.543 --> 05:27.979
for an online news outlet
called--

05:28.023 --> 05:30.373
I'm sorry, are we really
doing this?

05:30.417 --> 05:32.593
Pretending that it's not, like,
I don't know, insane

05:32.636 --> 05:34.508
that we're taking on a case
based on a premonition?

05:34.551 --> 05:36.248
I didn't say I was
taking on the case.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.381
I can't say I'm not curious.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.861
And what if his sister
really is in danger?

05:39.904 --> 05:41.732
It couldn't hurt
to figure it out.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.691
Oh. Don't tell me you believe
in this nonsense, too.

05:43.734 --> 05:46.215
Babe, it is not a crime
to have an open mind.

05:46.258 --> 05:49.479
And I've had several experiences
that I cannot explain.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.741
Here comes Skinny Rick.

05:50.785 --> 05:53.004
Who's Skinny Rick?Skinny Rick is

05:53.048 --> 05:57.095
a finance bro who hung himself
upstairs in the bathroom

05:57.139 --> 05:58.532
during the crash of 1987.

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
She thinks the upstairs bar
is haunted.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.405
Because it is.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.538
Sometimes at night,
the light turns off by itself.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.887
Because of
the faulty electricity.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.541
And I hear footsteps.Of rats.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.543
I'm telling you, I saw
the shadow of, like,

06:09.586 --> 06:11.762
two skinny legs
just, like dangling and, like,

06:11.806 --> 06:13.155
hitting the wall
of the men's room.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.591
Ooh, I--
Even during the day

06:14.635 --> 06:15.897
I don't like being in there.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.551
It's just the men's bathroom.

06:17.594 --> 06:18.987
It's revolting.
Nobody likes being in there.

06:19.030 --> 06:20.728
Come on, Rob,
a little help.

06:22.512 --> 06:23.774
I don't know, Harry.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.602
I gotta say
there are times when

06:25.646 --> 06:27.474
I've had a feeling
that I should duck

06:27.517 --> 06:29.040
or take a different door,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.391
or go left instead of right.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.437
And more than once, those
decisions have saved my life.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.178
I think that's just
called training.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.398
I mean, you guys, I've done
background on this guy.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.400
Okay? He's been in and out
of rehab, he's been arrested

06:40.443 --> 06:43.272
a multitude of times
for public disturbances,

06:43.315 --> 06:44.447
and he's taken more than one
involuntary trip

06:44.491 --> 06:45.840
to the psych ward.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.276
He mentioned he had
some problems.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.539
But still, he was rattled.
Come on.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.367
What's the harm in spending
a little time

06:51.411 --> 06:52.412
looking into his concerns?

06:52.455 --> 06:54.718
Even you cannot argue with that.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.633
I'll reach out
to Calista's job

06:56.677 --> 06:59.244
and see if they heard from her.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.029
And I'll look into her
phone records and financials

07:01.072 --> 07:02.422
and see what they tell us.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.335
And I will swing
by her apartment

07:03.379 --> 07:04.772
and do a wellness check.

07:06.730 --> 07:08.428
Do a wellness check on you guys.

07:11.256 --> 07:13.433
Building maintenance.

07:15.565 --> 07:17.654
Hello?

07:19.787 --> 07:21.615
Calista?

07:58.042 --> 07:59.522
The place looks neat
but the drawers are open.

07:59.566 --> 08:01.045
He was looking for something.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.786
Okay, but can we talk
about something?

08:02.830 --> 08:04.527
The guy had a scar
on his face.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.876
You saying that's
a coincidence?

08:05.920 --> 08:08.488
I'm saying I'm sure
there's a logical explanation

08:08.531 --> 08:10.533
for how Julien knew
about the guy.Which is?

08:10.577 --> 08:11.708
I don't know yet.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.362
Mm-hmm. Okay.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.320
Well, Julien was
definitely right about

08:15.364 --> 08:16.539
his siter being in trouble.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.019
You talk to the editor?

08:18.062 --> 08:19.716
He hasn't heard
from her in a week.

08:19.760 --> 08:20.804
He mention what
she was working on?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.371
A lifestyle piece

08:22.414 --> 08:25.156
on a local activist
named Rosa Martinez.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.810
Supposed to be the next A.O.C.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.769
It was a puff piece,
but she never turned it in.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.248
He tried contacting her
a bunch of times

08:30.292 --> 08:31.380
after some missed deadlines,

08:31.423 --> 08:32.337
but he wasn't able to reach her.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.513
I think I know why, though.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.514
Calista turned her phone off

08:34.557 --> 08:35.863
a couple of days ago,

08:35.906 --> 08:37.473
but the last call she got was

08:37.517 --> 08:38.213
from an unregistered number.

08:38.256 --> 08:39.736
Then, an hour later,

08:39.780 --> 08:40.911
she withdrew a thousand dollars

08:40.955 --> 08:42.391
from her bank account.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.132
Why would she need
that kind of cash?

08:44.175 --> 08:47.309
She was with some guy when
she was taking the money out.

08:47.352 --> 08:49.050
Face rec ID'd him
as Carlos Vela.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.573
He's a street-level
drug dealer.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.574
He did time for possession
and assault.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.271
A drug dealer?

08:53.315 --> 08:54.751
But how is that connected
to her disappearance?

08:54.795 --> 08:56.666
Or our scar-faced shooter?

08:56.710 --> 08:58.363
Harry, send me
the ATM photo.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.930
Maybe Dante has some intel

08:59.974 --> 09:01.453
on where this Carlos operates.

09:01.497 --> 09:03.194
I'll track down Rosa Martinez.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.500
If Calista was doing
a piece on her,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.328
they must have
spent time together.

09:06.371 --> 09:07.677
Maybe she knows something.

09:07.721 --> 09:08.852
Harry,
can you pull anything else

09:08.896 --> 09:11.681
off that phone?
Texts, notes?

09:11.725 --> 09:14.031
Since she turned her phone off,
I'm gonna have to hack her cloud

09:14.075 --> 09:16.425
through corporate servers.
I got a program running,

09:16.468 --> 09:17.252
but it's gonna take a minute.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.341
Okay, meantime,

09:19.384 --> 09:21.778
I want to talk to Julien again,
see what else he knows.

09:21.822 --> 09:22.997
You know what?
I think I'm gonna join you.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.391
What? You wanted me
to be open-minded.

09:26.435 --> 09:27.871
Just, you know,
want to meet the guy.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
So it's true?

09:30.744 --> 09:32.397
We can't speak
to the premonitions.

09:32.441 --> 09:34.486
But your sister is in danger.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.401
You recognize him?

09:36.445 --> 09:37.881
No. I don't think so.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.013
Should I?

09:39.056 --> 09:41.102
He's a drug dealer.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.017
Your sister was with him
a couple days ago.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.453
That's not possible.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.150
Calista's always been clean.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.804
She's the one trying
to get me to go into rehab.

09:47.848 --> 09:48.979
All right, what about the guy
with the scar?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.024
What can you tell us about him?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.721
Uh, I don't know.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.637
Um, it's all a jumble
in my head.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.640
Julien, you sure
you haven't seen him somewhere?

09:57.684 --> 09:59.990
I'm sorry. I have to go.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.644
Where?

10:01.688 --> 10:03.167
I have to be on the corner
of 51st and Center

10:03.211 --> 10:04.778
in, uh, in-in 15 minutes.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.997
Why?I don't know.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.390
I just know that something's
gonna happen there.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.739
Something. Very specific.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.349
Uh, hey,

10:11.393 --> 10:12.612
do you mind if I come?Actually,

10:12.655 --> 10:14.222
I think you're supposed to.

10:14.265 --> 10:16.137
But we have to go.Wow.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.355
Mystery field trip.
You want to come?

10:17.399 --> 10:18.922
Love to, but Dante just sent me

10:18.966 --> 10:20.532
a location for Carlos Vela.

10:20.576 --> 10:21.751
We have to go right now.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.623
All right. Huh.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.807
Because going to bat
for the people of this district,

10:33.850 --> 10:36.374
making dreams
like this rec center a reality--

10:36.418 --> 10:38.812
that's not just my job.

10:38.855 --> 10:40.988
It's my honor.

10:43.468 --> 10:47.995
And finally, I'd like to give a
special thanks to Rosa Martinez

10:48.038 --> 10:52.042
for everything she's done
to make this project happen.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.103
Excuse me,
Ms. Martinez?

11:09.146 --> 11:10.321
Hi. I'm Lynn.
I work with Calista Thibideaux.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.496
Can I have a word?

11:11.540 --> 11:13.890
Excuse me a second.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.110
Sure. How's Calista doing?

11:16.153 --> 11:18.721
Well, that's what I wanted
to ask you about.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.375
When was the last time
you saw her?

11:20.418 --> 11:22.594
Maybe two weeks ago. Why?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.684
She's missing.

11:24.727 --> 11:27.034
Missing?

11:27.077 --> 11:28.992
Damn.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.864
I was worried something
like that would happen.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.822
What do you mean by that?

11:32.866 --> 11:34.737
Calista and I had
several interviews.

11:34.781 --> 11:38.219
At first,
she was focused, engaged.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.613
We actually bonded
over growing up in foster care.

11:41.657 --> 11:43.746
But then?

11:43.790 --> 11:48.446
She started showing up late,
missing appointments.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.884
She was distracted,
on edge.

11:50.927 --> 11:53.538
Something was going on.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.149
Did she ever say what?

11:55.192 --> 11:57.238
No.

11:57.281 --> 12:00.720
Look, I'm not saying
it was drugs,

12:00.763 --> 12:03.113
but I've seen
that behavior before

12:03.157 --> 12:04.724
at the free clinic.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.727
I really hope she's okay.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.294
Thank you for your time.

12:10.338 --> 12:12.383
Yeah.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.392
Yo, Carlos.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.654
I know you?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.308
No.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.615
But you know her.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.312
What drugs did you sell her?

12:28.356 --> 12:29.923
Come on.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.626
I can make your life,
and walking, extremely difficult

12:37.669 --> 12:39.149
if you don't tell me
what I want to know.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.629
Who the hell are you?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.370
Long-term friend
with a short fuse.

12:42.413 --> 12:44.198
Okay, all right!

12:44.241 --> 12:45.982
She was a customer, but

12:46.026 --> 12:47.505
she wasn't looking
to get high.

12:47.549 --> 12:48.332
She wanted a gun.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.856
Sold her a .22.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.248
.22?

12:52.510 --> 12:54.338
She say why?No.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.210
Said it had to be a piece
that couldn't be traced.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.778
You don't ask for that unless
you're planning to use it.

13:01.476 --> 13:04.218
So what are we
looking for, anyway?

13:04.261 --> 13:06.829
All I know is that I'm supposed
to be here right now.

13:06.873 --> 13:09.136
And I'm supposed
to be here with you?

13:09.179 --> 13:11.529
You guys are good.
Got to hand it to you.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.401
I mean, you make things
sound important, you know,

13:13.444 --> 13:15.229
but just keep it vague enough
so you're never actually

13:15.272 --> 13:17.013
really wrong about anything.People have been

13:17.057 --> 13:18.841
hating on me my entire life.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.625
It's not my job
to convince you.

13:20.669 --> 13:21.931
Because you can't.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.933
I mean, come on.
Give me something.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.761
Uh, what's the score of
tonight's Knicks game gonna be?

13:25.805 --> 13:27.371
I'm thinking of a number
between one and ten.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.199
That's a "gimme." It's always
either three or seven.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.853
It doesn't work like that.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.421
I have no control
over what I see or when.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.988
That's convenient.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.294
You think I really like
seeing burning bodies?

13:37.338 --> 13:38.905
You think I like knowing
that the towers are gonna fall?

13:38.948 --> 13:40.471
That the levee
is going to fail?

13:40.515 --> 13:41.995
Seeing all of those faces,

13:42.038 --> 13:44.171
and I'm not able
to help a single one of them,

13:44.214 --> 13:45.825
and you really think
I give a damn

13:45.868 --> 13:47.435
about whether or not
you believe me?

13:52.309 --> 13:54.442
Hey, Rob. How'd it go
with our drug dealer?

13:54.485 --> 13:58.446
You were right. Calista did
buy something from him-- a gun.

13:58.489 --> 13:59.926
No, that's not possible.

13:59.969 --> 14:00.927
What makes you say that?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.580
Because ever since

14:02.624 --> 14:04.800
our parents got shot,
Calista hates guns.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.367
She hates 'em more
than anything.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.630
Well, he made it seem like
she intended to use it.

14:08.673 --> 14:09.631
You guys see anything yet?

14:09.674 --> 14:11.894
Oh, yeah. A woman

14:11.938 --> 14:13.809
pushing a shopping cart
full of groceries.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.029
And, uh, a group of girls,

14:16.072 --> 14:19.032
high school girls, giggling.
Very suspicious.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.642
Not helping, Harry.

14:20.685 --> 14:21.686
Wait, wait. Hold up,
hold up, hold up.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.819
There's a guy with a ponytail

14:23.863 --> 14:26.169
who's definitely too old

14:26.213 --> 14:27.910
to be wearing a ponytail.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.825
That's an open and shut case
right there, right?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.306
I got to go.
Go?

14:32.349 --> 14:34.308
Well, where?

14:34.351 --> 14:36.397
And he's gone.What happened?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.312
I don't know. Must have had
another vision to get out

14:38.355 --> 14:40.140
of explaining this one.
Do you want me to go after him?

14:40.183 --> 14:43.143
No. We need to know more
about what Calista was up to.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.622
How's your hacking bot coming
with that cloud account?

14:44.666 --> 14:45.885
Should be done about now.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.714
This looks like
a general work folder.

14:49.758 --> 14:52.456
Random story ideas.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.024
Oh, look. Here's the unfinished
profile on Rosa Martinez.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.722
This might be something.
A notes folder.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.942
Multitudes of entries in
the days before she disappeared.

14:59.986 --> 15:04.077
"35 a.m. MN arrived 18237."

15:04.120 --> 15:07.776
"12 a.m.
CJS, 217 North Street."

15:07.819 --> 15:10.344
"MN. CJS."
What are those? Initials?

15:10.387 --> 15:11.998
These were all uploaded
in the early morning hours

15:12.041 --> 15:14.783
between, like,
- 00 and- 00 a.m.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.785
Street names, numbers.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.569
Looks like she was doing
some sort of surveillance.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.223
For what?
If it was a story,

15:20.267 --> 15:22.138
wouldn't her editor
know about it?

15:22.182 --> 15:23.835
Harry, what's the last
thing she wrote down

15:23.879 --> 15:24.836
before her phone
went dark?

15:24.880 --> 15:26.926
Last things to sync was

15:26.969 --> 15:28.971
two days ago,15 a.m.,
a couple of photos.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.887
It's a silver Mercedes,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.758
just like
in Julien's premonition.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.543
Now, that's a little weird.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.371
I mean, you know,

15:37.414 --> 15:39.329
there are silver Mercedes
all over town, right?

15:39.373 --> 15:41.592
Yeah, Calista was definitely
interested in this one.

15:41.636 --> 15:43.116
Harry, run that plate.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.077
Well, uh, it's registered
to a shell corp.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.513
It'll take a while
to track it to its owner,

15:49.557 --> 15:50.732
but it does have GPS.

15:50.775 --> 15:51.733
Can you ping it?

15:51.776 --> 15:53.169
Yeah.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.129
It's in Downtown Brooklyn.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.174
Okay.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.959
Let's see how real
these premonitions are.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.743
They're scary.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.573
Like, my heart begins to pound,

16:05.616 --> 16:08.010
my neck and my face get hot.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.448
I want to run...

16:11.492 --> 16:15.322
somewhere, hide.

16:15.365 --> 16:18.325
And then it passes.

16:18.368 --> 16:21.154
I mean, does this mean
my PTS is coming back?

16:21.197 --> 16:23.939
I wouldn't phrase it
quite like that,

16:23.983 --> 16:26.594
but it sounds like
something is triggering you.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.814
Is there anything specific
that you have noticed

16:29.858 --> 16:32.208
that happens just before
these latest attacks?

16:34.210 --> 16:36.430
I mean, there is one thing,

16:36.473 --> 16:37.866
I guess.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.000
It's my parents.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.351
Things got much better
after the divorce, but

16:44.394 --> 16:47.441
I lie to my mom about
what my dad says about her,

16:47.484 --> 16:50.487
and then, I lie to my dad
about what my mom does all day.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.794
It's like I'm carrying around
all these secrets,

16:52.837 --> 16:56.363
having to pretend like nothing
is wrong, and...

16:59.496 --> 17:01.237
How do you do it?

17:03.109 --> 17:06.155
You have to carry around
classified secrets all the time.

17:06.199 --> 17:09.506
They're my patients,
not my parents.

17:09.550 --> 17:11.987
But I wonder,

17:12.031 --> 17:14.076
is it keeping the secrets,

17:14.120 --> 17:17.036
or is it the secrets
themselves?

17:20.648 --> 17:23.259
When her mentor was killed,
how did that make you feel?

17:27.481 --> 17:29.396
Like...

17:31.876 --> 17:33.922
...it could happen to her.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.361
Delilah,

17:38.405 --> 17:40.842
you have been through so much.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.366
Losing your friend,

17:43.410 --> 17:44.976
learning
about your mother's past

17:45.020 --> 17:46.978
and what she's doing now.

17:47.022 --> 17:50.286
Your world turned upside down.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.248
Yeah, it did.

17:58.947 --> 18:02.124
Sorry. I don't really know
why I'm crying.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.866
Uh...

18:07.782 --> 18:09.871
I just...
I thought I was over it.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.266
Like PTS,

18:13.309 --> 18:16.312
this isn't something
that you get over,

18:16.356 --> 18:18.009
like a cold.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.273
You have to keep
working at it.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.144
Have you told your mom
how you feel?

18:22.188 --> 18:23.493
I don't know.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.191
She spends all day

18:25.234 --> 18:26.975
helping people
with real problems.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.457
All she wants to hear is
I'm okay.

18:31.719 --> 18:33.677
Is that what she wants,

18:33.721 --> 18:35.549
or is that what you want?

18:39.030 --> 18:42.338
It's okay not to be okay.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.008
Blood.

19:26.252 --> 19:29.472
Detective. Good to see
you back in the suit.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.387
Thanks.

19:31.431 --> 19:33.694
Could've done without
the welcome-back present.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.522
Guy's name is Frank Castor.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.785
Local hitter, been tied
to a half a dozen bodies.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.830
Rounds that killed him
were close range.

19:39.874 --> 19:42.268
Looks to be small caliber.
Possibly a .22.

19:42.311 --> 19:44.270
How'd you find this guy?

19:44.313 --> 19:45.923
Client's sister went missing.

19:45.967 --> 19:47.969
A reporter named
Calista Thibideaux.

19:48.012 --> 19:49.797
Pretty sure this
guy was after her.

19:51.146 --> 19:52.582
Your client file
a police report?

19:53.844 --> 19:56.238
You wouldn't have
believed him if he did.

19:56.282 --> 19:59.372
He had a vision that
his sister was in trouble.

19:59.415 --> 20:01.330
And you took him on
based on that?

20:01.374 --> 20:03.332
I just wanted
to see if he was right.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.595
And from the looks
of it, he was.

20:05.639 --> 20:08.337
He was able to describe the car
and the dead body inside.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.644
Here you go,
Detective.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.994
Did your client happen
to be Julien Thibideaux?

20:13.037 --> 20:14.822
Yeah. Why?

20:14.865 --> 20:17.781
I don't think his descriptions
are coming from his vision.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.175
His prints were found
all over the inside of this car.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.569
I knew
there was an explanation.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.266
Julien is involved.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.181
Okay, but involved with what?Whatever.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.443
The point is,
it's not supernatural.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.402
Well, if he's involved,
why come to me?

20:29.445 --> 20:31.055
Because he's looking
for his sister.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.448
Maybe she's hiding from him.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.928
Maybe that's why
she got a gun.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.192
Dante, what'd you find?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.976
I just spoke
to the PD in Youngsville,

20:39.020 --> 20:40.587
where Julien
and his sister grew up.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.632
Turns out she went
to the cops more than once

20:42.676 --> 20:44.591
to file a restraining order
against her brother.

20:44.634 --> 20:45.896
She'd change her mind
at the last minute,

20:45.940 --> 20:47.289
but clearly,
there were issues.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.812
Clearly,
there still are.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.598
We need to find Julien.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.730
I'll put out an APB.
Call you with an update.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.384
I knew

20:55.428 --> 20:57.081
there was something off
about that dude.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.605
Yeah,
but Julien hiring a hitter?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.433
That seems off, too.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.043
Harry, is there
a way you can track

21:02.086 --> 21:04.001
where that silver
Mercedes came from?

21:04.045 --> 21:06.265
Uh, before it winded up parked
with a dead guy in the trunk?

21:06.308 --> 21:08.092
There was no GPS history.

21:08.136 --> 21:09.833
I can try and find it
on street cams in the area,

21:09.877 --> 21:12.271
and then reverse track it,
I guess. It'll take some time.

21:12.314 --> 21:14.403
But it could tell us when
Julien met up with scar-face.

21:15.622 --> 21:18.189
And if anyone else is involved.

21:20.366 --> 21:24.239
well, someone's
working late hours.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.676
It's this case.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.939
How's Dee?

21:28.983 --> 21:32.029
How's she doing
after her therapy session?

21:32.073 --> 21:34.380
Distant, distracted.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.077
She said she's good,

21:36.120 --> 21:38.819
but went straight up
to her room to study.

21:41.909 --> 21:44.128
She keeps saying
she's fine, but

21:44.172 --> 21:47.175
my instincts tell me
something is up with her.

21:47.218 --> 21:51.484
Then again, my instincts
could use some fine-tuning.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.355
I think my client
may be lying to me.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.836
Must be a criminal mastermind.

21:55.879 --> 21:59.143
He claims

21:59.187 --> 22:01.276
he had a vision
his sister was in danger.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.495
Was he right?

22:02.538 --> 22:04.279
About everything.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.020
Which is why I should
have been suspicious.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.152
I don't know about that.

22:08.196 --> 22:09.980
I've had my share
of premonitions

22:10.024 --> 22:10.938
that have come true.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.374
About what?

22:13.419 --> 22:15.508
Well...

22:19.381 --> 22:21.296
Mm-mm.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.646
It upsets you to talk
about your dad's death.

22:28.564 --> 22:29.957
Aunt Vi,

22:30.000 --> 22:32.089
it's okay.

22:32.133 --> 22:33.569
I want to hear.

22:36.050 --> 22:39.880
The night it happened,
I... went to bed early.

22:41.403 --> 22:46.539
Just remember feeling
like something was off.

22:46.582 --> 22:50.760
Later on, I bolted up in the bed
from a deep sleep, my heart just

22:50.804 --> 22:54.373
pounding.

22:54.416 --> 22:58.899
Before the police could call,
anybody could tell me, I...

22:58.942 --> 23:00.901
I knew.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.773
Call it spiritual
or supernatural,

23:03.817 --> 23:06.994
I don't know, but...

23:07.037 --> 23:08.909
it was real.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.393
Got to take this.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.612
Hey, Dante. What's up?

23:16.656 --> 23:18.309
Unis just picked up Julien.

23:18.353 --> 23:19.572
I'm going to talk to him now.

23:19.615 --> 23:20.834
I'll let you know
what I find out.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.444
Thanks.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.054
I'm gonna ask you again.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.013
How do you know Frank Castor?

23:26.056 --> 23:27.928
And I'm gonna tell you again.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.799
I don't.
So, what?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.410
Your fingerprints just
magically appeared in his car?

23:31.453 --> 23:33.150
Don't matter
what I say to you.

23:33.194 --> 23:34.456
You're not gonna believe me.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.415
Nobody ever believes my kind.

23:36.458 --> 23:39.069
Okay. Let's say
you saw him in your dream.

23:39.113 --> 23:41.158
That doesn't explain
why you were in his car.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.856
Because I was drawn to it.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.988
Something pulled me into

23:45.032 --> 23:47.817
the direction where the car
was parked. I recognized it.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.993
From your dream?I thought it might offer

23:50.037 --> 23:52.605
a clue about my sister,
so I looked inside,

23:52.648 --> 23:54.476
but when I popped that trunk,

23:54.520 --> 23:55.956
and I saw that body,
man, I took off.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.785
You're right.
I don't believe you.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.613
If you're so concerned
with your sister's safety,

24:00.656 --> 24:02.919
you want to explain why she
almost filed a restraining order

24:02.963 --> 24:05.705
against you?That? Man, I'm trying
to protect her.

24:05.748 --> 24:08.403
That so? Sheriff I talked to
said you were violent.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.927
My sister-- she has not had
the best luck in men, okay?

24:10.971 --> 24:12.799
And I could see it coming.
I could see it coming,

24:12.842 --> 24:14.235
every single thing
that they were gonna do.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.279
So, one night,
I got into it with a guy

24:15.323 --> 24:17.281
who was about to cheat on her.

24:17.325 --> 24:20.328
But he hadn't cheated on her?He hadn't cheated on her yet.

24:20.371 --> 24:23.505
Coming up, my sister was
always looking out for me.

24:23.549 --> 24:25.072
I was trying to do
the same thing, man, but I...

24:25.115 --> 24:26.465
I was a lot.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.814
So when she moved
to New York,

24:27.857 --> 24:29.468
when she asked me
not to follow, hey,

24:29.511 --> 24:30.643
I respected that.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.035
And yet, here you are.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.384
Because she's in trouble, man!

24:33.428 --> 24:34.647
I'm just trying
to find her

24:34.690 --> 24:36.213
before it's too late.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.085
It might be too late already!What did you

24:38.128 --> 24:39.303
and Calista talk about the night
she disappeared?

24:39.347 --> 24:40.566
I didn't talk to Calista

24:40.609 --> 24:42.089
the night she disappeared.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.307
I pulled records from
that phone you have.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.048
You and your sister talked

24:45.092 --> 24:47.268
for 20 minutes
three days ago. What about?

24:47.311 --> 24:49.662
I don't remember
having a phone call

24:49.705 --> 24:51.620
with Calista three days ago.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.667
So you can see into the future,
but you can't remember

24:54.710 --> 24:57.713
a 20-minute call
from a few nights ago?

24:57.757 --> 25:00.803
I take pills sometimes
to help me sleep.

25:00.847 --> 25:04.546
And sometimes, when I'm on 'em,

25:04.590 --> 25:06.635
I do things
that I don't remember.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.120
So either Julien's lying,
and he's involved,

25:13.163 --> 25:14.251
or he's not involved,
and his sister told him

25:14.295 --> 25:16.123
what she was into,

25:16.166 --> 25:18.691
and his drug-addled mind
decided that that was a vision.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.475
Either way,
it's totally explainable,

25:20.519 --> 25:21.911
except for the part
where you guys believed him.

25:21.955 --> 25:25.828
Either way, Dante's holding him
for 24 hours.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.569
And we still have
to find Calista.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.918
Were you able
to backtrack that car?

25:28.962 --> 25:30.267
Yeah, it took a while to piece

25:30.311 --> 25:31.921
the traffic cam footage
together,

25:31.965 --> 25:33.270
but I managed to trace the car
back to a bar.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.446
Now that's our scar-face
with this guy.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.057
I ran him
through the database.

25:37.100 --> 25:38.928
This is Milosz Nemanjic.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.495
He's the head of a branch
of the Serbian syndicate.

25:42.192 --> 25:43.759
Milosz Nemanjic.

25:43.803 --> 25:48.111
"MN." Like the initials
in Calista's notes.

25:48.155 --> 25:49.939
She was following him?

25:49.983 --> 25:52.159
Yeah, this is not a guy
you want on your bad side.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.509
He was an orphan refugee
from Belgrade.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.424
He used to run errands
for the local Serbian gangs

25:56.467 --> 25:59.296
here as a kid in New York,
and now, he runs the crew.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.908
Okay, but what is a lifestyle
journalist doing tailing him?

26:01.951 --> 26:04.127
And why do the Serbs
want her dead?

26:04.171 --> 26:07.130
If they are after her, it could
be why she bought that gun.

26:07.174 --> 26:08.479
Well, if she felt
she was in such danger,

26:08.523 --> 26:10.090
why not to go to the cops?

26:12.919 --> 26:15.356
It's time
to make a new acquaintance.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.643
I don't know who you are,
or how you got in here,

26:41.687 --> 26:45.212
but if you wanted to kill me,
I'd be dead by now.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.825
Why are you going after
Calista Thibideaux?

26:49.869 --> 26:51.958
I don't know who that is.

26:52.001 --> 26:55.483
You sent someone to kill her.
Ring any bells?

26:55.526 --> 26:59.792
If I want someone dead,
I do it myself,

26:59.835 --> 27:02.055
up close and, uh,

27:02.098 --> 27:03.622
personal.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.979
What you gonna
light it with? This?

27:14.241 --> 27:17.461
Kneel. Face the wall.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.812
I said kneel.

27:21.422 --> 27:24.207
Oh, I thought you
weren't gonna kill me.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.732
You said that, not me.

27:26.775 --> 27:29.386
You'll never get past my men.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.606
I got in here, didn't I?

27:31.650 --> 27:35.305
If you're gonna do it, do it.

27:45.315 --> 27:46.012
Did you get close enough?

27:46.055 --> 27:47.100
Yup.

27:48.362 --> 27:50.103
Oh, look at that.
He's making a call right now.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.366
Yeah.

27:52.409 --> 27:54.107
Someone's asking questions
about the reporter.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.675
Move everything
out of there now.

27:56.718 --> 27:57.893
Can you get a location
on that phone he just called?

27:57.937 --> 27:59.503
I want to know
what they're moving.

27:59.547 --> 28:00.722
Mm-hmm. Triangulating.

28:04.508 --> 28:06.293
Rob, I'm closer. I'm going.

28:06.336 --> 28:07.816
Okay, let me know
when you got something.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.301
They're definitely
closing up shop.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.433
Can you see
what they're transporting?

28:16.477 --> 28:18.479
I'm gonna take a closer look.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.089
Just be careful, Mel.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.182
Rob, it's guns.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.532
They're moving them in volume.
I also saw

29:11.575 --> 29:13.142
this metallic dust...

29:13.186 --> 29:16.363
Calista? Calista, wait!

29:16.406 --> 29:18.713
Calista?Stay back!

29:23.370 --> 29:24.980
Mel, are you there?

29:25.024 --> 29:26.068
What's happening?

29:33.075 --> 29:34.424
Well, at least we know
Calista's still alive.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.818
Yeah, and terrified enough
to shoot at me.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.820
She's probably in survival mode.

29:38.864 --> 29:39.952
She doesn't know who to trust.

29:39.995 --> 29:41.605
But what was she doing there?

29:41.649 --> 29:42.998
Well, based on those crates
that Mel saw,

29:43.042 --> 29:45.000
I think the Serbians
are dealing guns.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.307
Illegal guns. I mean,
the metallic dust I found?

29:47.350 --> 29:49.309
They were filing off
serial numbers.That's why

29:49.352 --> 29:51.833
Calista wanted a street piece
that couldn't be traced.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.792
She was buying evidence
for her article.

29:53.835 --> 29:57.665
Except when that hitter found
her, she wound up using it.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.449
Okay, but how did she stumble

29:59.493 --> 30:01.103
across this whole operation
to begin with?

30:01.147 --> 30:02.801
I mean, she's a lifestyle
reporter, right?

30:02.844 --> 30:04.672
I mean, she's not Woodward
and Bernstein.

30:04.715 --> 30:08.458
Well, she was doing a profile
on Rosa Martinez, the activist.

30:08.502 --> 30:11.200
Can we pull up her bio?

30:11.244 --> 30:14.682
Rosa Martinez.
Grew up in the projects.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.336
Graduated from Columbia,

30:16.379 --> 30:17.772
started a bunch of
community outreach projects.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.600
Can we see a list
of the programs?

30:19.643 --> 30:21.384
"Literacy Drive."

30:21.428 --> 30:23.865
"Big Brother Mentorship."There.

30:23.909 --> 30:26.433
She started a gun
amnesty program.

30:26.476 --> 30:29.392
You turn in your weapons, and in
exchange, you're not prosecuted.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.612
But somehow, the Serbs get
ahold of them,

30:31.655 --> 30:32.918
strip off the serial numbers

30:32.961 --> 30:35.094
and then put them back
on the streets.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.923
So that's why she didn't
want to go to the cops.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.055
Since the cops
collect the guns,

30:40.099 --> 30:41.491
she thought
they might be involved.

30:41.535 --> 30:42.971
Mel, this gun you took--

30:43.015 --> 30:44.799
does it still have
its serial number?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.018
Yeah. Why?

30:49.325 --> 30:51.240
You were right.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.199
It was turned into
the amnesty program a week ago.

30:53.242 --> 30:55.810
Which means someone in that
program is funneling these guns

30:55.854 --> 30:57.290
to the Serbian mob.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.989
You don't think any cops
are involved, do you?

31:01.033 --> 31:04.210
No, but I can't swear to it.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.038
What's the chain of custody
for the weapons

31:06.081 --> 31:08.040
after they're turned in?

31:08.083 --> 31:12.392
Looks like volunteer NYPD
officers collect the firearms.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.350
Then they're picked up
by an armored car and taken

31:14.394 --> 31:16.091
to a foundry, where they're
melted down into scrap.

31:16.135 --> 31:18.093
And who arranges that?
Rosa Martinez?

31:18.137 --> 31:19.747
No.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.183
They just put her name
on the program

31:21.227 --> 31:22.881
because it means something
in that community.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.666
All the details,
the contract,

31:25.709 --> 31:27.711
this whole program
is the brainchild

31:27.755 --> 31:29.061
of Councilman Joe Silva.

31:29.104 --> 31:33.500
Councilman Joe Silva? CJS.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.285
Councilman Joe Silva.
Former gang member.

31:36.329 --> 31:38.026
Got into politics later
in life. Said he wanted

31:38.070 --> 31:40.637
to serve the community
that he once harmed.

31:40.681 --> 31:43.727
Now he's running for borough
president under a platform

31:43.771 --> 31:45.947
of "ridding the streets
of senseless gun violence."

31:45.991 --> 31:47.514
If he's taking a cut
from the Serbs,

31:47.557 --> 31:50.038
he's definitely taking money
to run his campaign.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.475
While stoking the gun problem
he's promising to fix.

31:52.519 --> 31:54.216
In order for Silva to do this,
he would need someone

31:54.260 --> 31:55.652
helping him from inside
the chain of custody.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.698
Well, I compiled

31:57.741 --> 32:00.744
everybody from armored car
company and the smelting plant.

32:00.788 --> 32:03.356
See if any of them have
a connection to the councilman.

32:03.399 --> 32:06.272
A deep dive into all of them?
I mean, it would take weeks.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.708
The Serbs are still
after Calista.

32:07.751 --> 32:08.970
She doesn't have weeks.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.232
No.

32:10.276 --> 32:11.886
What?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.496
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.716
What?Third row.

32:15.759 --> 32:17.239
Second from the right.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.849
That's the guy I saw

32:18.893 --> 32:20.112
on Julien's stakeout.

32:20.155 --> 32:22.984
Ponytail guy.

32:23.028 --> 32:25.247
He works
for the smelting company.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.075
Want to start with him?

32:30.122 --> 32:31.775
Just want us to review
the press release for tomorrow,

32:31.819 --> 32:33.386
make sure I...Hey!

32:33.429 --> 32:35.866
Calista.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.390
Thank God.

32:37.433 --> 32:38.782
Are you okay?

32:38.826 --> 32:40.262
Can we talk?

32:40.306 --> 32:41.960
Alone?

32:46.312 --> 32:48.705
It's about
your gun amnesty program.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.404
I think Councilman Silva is
selling the guns to traffickers,

32:51.447 --> 32:53.145
who are putting them
right back onto the streets.

32:53.188 --> 32:55.190
Are you sure?I will be

32:55.234 --> 32:57.801
if you can help me get access
to some records.

33:01.327 --> 33:02.893
I got it.

33:02.937 --> 33:04.547
Two months ago, Ponytail,

33:04.591 --> 33:06.462
aka Deke Hartley,

33:06.506 --> 33:09.291
was in a lot of debt...
till suddenly, he just wasn't.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.337
It was all just
paid off at once.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.816
Looks like we got our guy.
So you're saying

33:12.860 --> 33:14.644
that your stakeout with Julien
wasn't a waste of time?

33:14.688 --> 33:16.559
You can torture me later. Right
now, we have bigger issues.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.431
Like connecting those payments
to the councilman.

33:18.474 --> 33:20.085
Well, doesn't look like
there's a money trail.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.564
Must've been cash deposits.

33:21.608 --> 33:22.826
We need a link, Harry.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.785
I think I got one.

33:24.828 --> 33:27.005
But it's not to the councilman.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.832
You guys, it's
to Rosa Martinez.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.052
What?Two years ago,

33:31.096 --> 33:32.749
Hartley worked
directly for Rosa.

33:32.793 --> 33:34.360
And then, six months ago,
after he got a job

33:34.403 --> 33:36.623
at the smelting factory,
suddenly, his daughter

33:36.666 --> 33:38.146
got a full scholarship
to private school...

33:39.887 --> 33:42.063
...funded by one
of Rosa's programs.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.847
That was a payoff.
He's her inside man.

33:43.891 --> 33:46.154
Councilman Silva isn't
the one giving guns

33:46.198 --> 33:47.416
to the Serbs.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.592
Rosa is.

33:49.636 --> 33:52.204
Don't worry. I got you.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.090
Excuse me.
Is Rosa Martinez here?

34:09.134 --> 34:10.483
We need to speak to her.

34:10.526 --> 34:11.875
I'm sorry.
She's gone for the day.

34:11.919 --> 34:13.094
It's an emergency.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.704
Where can we find her?Not sure.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.445
We were heading to an event,

34:16.489 --> 34:17.751
but she had to cancel
to meet with a reporter.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.013
They left together.

34:20.536 --> 34:22.364
Is this the reporter?

34:22.408 --> 34:23.800
Yeah.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.675
Harry, we got a problem.

34:28.718 --> 34:31.504
Rosa has Calista. We need to
find out where she's taking her.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.332
I think I got
a pretty good guess. You know,

34:33.375 --> 34:34.420
I've been trying to figure out
what the connection

34:34.463 --> 34:35.769
is between Rosa
and the Serbians.

34:35.812 --> 34:37.031
And then it hit me.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.772
Rosa spent time in foster care,

34:38.815 --> 34:40.426
and Milosz Nemanjic

34:40.469 --> 34:41.514
was an orphan.

34:41.557 --> 34:42.515
Don't tell me.

34:42.558 --> 34:44.212
I did some research,

34:44.256 --> 34:45.735
and they were both placed
with the same family.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.520
Rob, I mean,
they're essentially siblings.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.217
Okay, I'm Rosa, and I want
to get rid of someone,

34:49.261 --> 34:50.740
I don't do it myself.

34:50.784 --> 34:53.265
No, I take her
to my sociopath foster brother.

34:53.308 --> 34:54.918
Harry, you still
have his phone cloned.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.268
Can you get a location?Yup.

34:56.311 --> 34:58.922
Dante's calling. Hold on.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.881
Hey, Dante. What's up?

35:00.924 --> 35:02.143
Is there something going on
with Julien's sister

35:02.187 --> 35:03.971
that I should know about?

35:04.014 --> 35:06.713
Detective! Let me go, man!
I have to save her!

35:06.756 --> 35:07.975
Why?

35:08.018 --> 35:08.802
Because out of nowhere,

35:08.845 --> 35:09.846
the guy just freaked.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.196
Started yelling

35:11.239 --> 35:12.414
how his sister was about to die.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.676
He may be right.

35:13.720 --> 35:14.895
I'll call you later.

35:14.938 --> 35:17.637
This is my sister, man!

35:21.945 --> 35:24.992
Are you sure the evidence
points to Councilman Silva?

35:25.035 --> 35:27.734
I am. I just need
a paper trail to confirm it.

35:27.777 --> 35:29.997
Have you shared any of it
with your editor yet?

35:30.040 --> 35:32.652
No. I haven't told anyone.

35:38.832 --> 35:41.356
What are we doing here?

35:56.023 --> 35:58.156
No! No!

36:02.638 --> 36:04.684
Why are you doing this, Rosa?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.990
Putting all those guns
back on the streets?

36:07.034 --> 36:09.819
Because if it wasn't me,
it'd just be someone else.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.082
So the programs,
the neighborhood outreach--

36:12.126 --> 36:14.041
it's all a lie?No.

36:14.084 --> 36:17.131
We still build rec centers,
support communities,

36:17.175 --> 36:19.568
but we're just also
taking care of ourselves.

36:19.612 --> 36:20.830
We always have.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.703
I'm sorry, Calista.

36:23.746 --> 36:28.186
The way we grew up, we both know
it's survival of the fittest.

36:43.940 --> 36:45.812
Oh!

36:48.075 --> 36:50.033
Mel, get Rosa!

37:00.740 --> 37:02.350
Hey!

37:24.503 --> 37:27.114
How's that
for getting guns off the street?

37:31.858 --> 37:34.034
You okay?

37:34.077 --> 37:36.297
A little shaken up,
but... yeah.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.691
I can't believe
I looked up to her.

37:38.734 --> 37:41.476
It was brave of you, taking
this on, risking your life.

37:41.520 --> 37:43.348
After what happened
to my parents,

37:43.391 --> 37:45.219
I couldn't sit back
and do nothing.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.047
The truth needs
to get out.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.789
Well, thanks
to you, it will.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.226
Only 'cause you showed up.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.662
How'd you find me?

37:56.665 --> 37:59.842
We wouldn't have been looking
if it weren't for your brother.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.239
Hey, Calista.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.633
I know you told me
not to follow you

38:07.676 --> 38:10.288
up here, but...Oh, God.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.945
I'm glad you came.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.947
I'm so happy you're okay.

38:22.778 --> 38:24.650
What made you
bring Julien?

38:24.693 --> 38:27.827
I had a hunch
it was the right thing to do.

38:27.870 --> 38:30.003
You had a hunch, huh?

38:30.046 --> 38:33.049
Call it a cop intuition.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.757
Hey. Did you see this?

38:44.800 --> 38:46.062
Calista's article
came out already.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.542
Oh, great.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.762
Uh, what about Julien, though?

38:49.805 --> 38:53.374
I mean, clairvoyant or not,
that guy is kind of a mess.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.681
Yeah, well, Calista asked him
to move to New York.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.509
She wants
to keep an eye on him.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.728
And he promised not
to interfere in her life.

38:59.772 --> 39:02.209
Does that include, uh, swearing
off the creepy premonitions?

39:02.252 --> 39:05.386
Okay, Mr. Cynical,
you have to admit

39:05.430 --> 39:07.867
those creepy premonitions
helped us solve the case.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.434
I will admit nothing
of the kind.

39:09.477 --> 39:11.914
Calista confirmed
that she told him

39:11.958 --> 39:13.916
that she was in danger on that
telephone call, all right?

39:13.960 --> 39:15.353
That accounts for his "visions."

39:15.396 --> 39:17.311
Well, what about the stakeout?

39:17.355 --> 39:18.573
You saw the ponytailed man.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.140
How do you explain that?

39:20.183 --> 39:21.750
With a single word: coincidence.

39:21.794 --> 39:25.406
So you do not believe
that, sometimes,

39:25.450 --> 39:28.888
someone can get, like,
a little glimpse of the future?

39:28.931 --> 39:30.672
Like, even just a little bit?I do not.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.373
You know, when Rob set us up,

39:35.416 --> 39:38.114
I almost canceled
our first date.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.769
No, I did. I had the phone out,
ready to call you.

39:40.813 --> 39:45.557
But at the last minute,
I got a sense that...

39:45.600 --> 39:47.733
something really important
was gonna happen,

39:47.776 --> 39:52.172
that, like, my life
maybe was about to change.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.177
Can we just agree

39:57.220 --> 40:00.006
that that was the luckiest,

40:00.049 --> 40:03.575
most magical night of my
life, and just move on?

40:05.011 --> 40:07.230
Okay. I'll allow it.

40:07.274 --> 40:09.015
Mm.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.019
Hey.

40:16.979 --> 40:19.765
I thought you could use
a cup of love.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.640
So, where
did you land

40:25.684 --> 40:27.642
with the premonitions?

40:29.035 --> 40:31.733
His sister's safe,
family's reunited.

40:31.777 --> 40:34.823
I don't know
what I believe, but...

40:34.867 --> 40:38.261
when brother and sister
finally met up,

40:38.305 --> 40:41.003
their connection...

40:41.047 --> 40:43.179
you could feel it.

40:43.223 --> 40:46.139
Kind of like you

40:46.182 --> 40:48.097
and Daddy.

40:49.185 --> 40:51.231
Do you have any idea

40:51.274 --> 40:53.276
how much your father adored you?

40:54.930 --> 40:57.237
I know you think what
happened that night

40:57.280 --> 40:59.413
was your fault...

41:00.458 --> 41:02.111
...but it wasn't.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.603
Am I
interrupting something?

41:15.647 --> 41:17.387
No, baby girl.

41:17.431 --> 41:19.607
What's going on?

41:19.651 --> 41:23.481
Uh, Mom, can we...

41:23.524 --> 41:26.005
I mean, do you
have a minute?

41:26.048 --> 41:27.485
Of course.

41:35.014 --> 41:37.190
I, um...

41:37.233 --> 41:39.714
I need to tell you

41:39.758 --> 41:42.630
that I haven't been
completely honest.

41:44.676 --> 41:46.808
Everything isn't okay.

41:49.942 --> 41:51.378
I had a sense.

41:52.466 --> 41:54.337
It's like...

41:54.381 --> 41:58.341
all the questions that Dad
keeps asking me, it's like,

41:58.385 --> 42:01.562
he doesn't believe me anymore.

42:01.606 --> 42:05.131
And he shouldn't,
because I am lying.

42:05.174 --> 42:08.047
I know.

42:08.090 --> 42:10.353
And I'm sorry.

42:10.397 --> 42:13.792
The worst part
of my life

42:13.835 --> 42:16.446
is knowing that
I have to be dishonest

42:16.490 --> 42:19.014
with the people I love.

42:19.058 --> 42:22.975
Lord knows I wish that didn't
have to be a part of yours.

42:25.804 --> 42:28.589
Well, there's-there's
something else.

42:28.633 --> 42:31.505
Because of what
you do, I...

42:31.549 --> 42:34.421
keep getting these

42:34.464 --> 42:36.902
random feelings of dread...

42:36.945 --> 42:40.253
like something horrible
is going to happen and...

42:40.296 --> 42:42.603
Dee, Dee. Dee.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.431
Listen to me,

42:44.474 --> 42:47.652
I would never let anything
happen to you.

42:49.044 --> 42:51.394
Mom, it's not me
that I'm worried about.

42:53.048 --> 42:55.094
It's you.

43:15.854 --> 43:20.075
and TOYOTA.
