00:10.802 --> 00:12.346
Hello, I'm Sheila D. Rubin,

00:12.429 --> 00:14.890
the newest member
of the Wake Up San Diego team.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.309
I'll be bringing you a new segment
once a week called--

00:17.935 --> 00:20.187
I'm sorry,
do you mind if I try that again?

00:21.063 --> 00:22.648
Hi, I'm Sheila D. Rubin,

00:22.731 --> 00:25.108
and I am the newest member of
the Wake Up San Diego team.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.735
-Thank you.
-I'll be bringing you

00:26.818 --> 00:29.154
a new segment every single week ca--

00:29.821 --> 00:31.448
-I'm so sorry, that's not right.
-It's all for you.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.784
Okay, I'll just try one more time.
Here it goes.

00:34.576 --> 00:38.956
Hello, I'm Sheila D. Rubin, the newest
member of the Wake Up San Diego team.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.209
I'll be bringing you a new weekly segment
called Waking Up With Sheila.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.337
Is that okay? That-- Did that work?

00:48.090 --> 00:53.929
To know who you choose to be,
we must first examine the competition.

00:54.429 --> 00:58.392
The Southern California fitness field
is growing, nay, flourishing.

00:59.142 --> 01:02.688
And in order to keep everyone straight,
we have separated them into convenient--

01:02.771 --> 01:06.608
if not somewhat oversimplified
lady buckets.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.945
I feel like we could come up
with a nicer phrase than--

01:10.028 --> 01:13.156
Lady bucket number one, "bubbly blondes."

01:13.740 --> 01:16.118
While there is no shortage
of competition in this area,

01:16.201 --> 01:18.287
the pacesetter, without a doubt,

01:19.830 --> 01:20.998
is Kelly Kilmartin.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.377
She's the bubbliest, the blondest
and without a doubt the most famous

01:25.460 --> 01:28.964
due to her starring role
in television's Trish Out of Water.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.258
Ugh, my favorite episode
is the one set in Hawaii.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.844
-Most of it's--
-Not ever, Fidelia.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.597
Kelly pulls off a real high-wire act.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.015
She's sexy enough for the men

01:38.098 --> 01:39.975
but still sweet enough
to appeal to the women.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.727
Okay, got the gist on that.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.771
Lady bucket number two, "sultry sirens."

01:44.855 --> 01:46.231
This is the under-the-radar

01:46.315 --> 01:49.026
but still fast-growing field
of ballet-based teachers.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.944
And at the very top of this heap,

01:52.279 --> 01:53.447
Rita Bachmann.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.909
She teaches a very exclusive,
very European class.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.411
You wanna think black leotards,
sweaty basements.

01:59.494 --> 02:03.290
And apparently she'll exercise
your lady basement as well.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.251
-She makes you squeeze your vagina.
-I got it. Loud and clear.

02:06.335 --> 02:08.711
Third bucket, "tough-girl tomboys."

02:08.794 --> 02:11.757
This is your short hair,
your muscle-bound, your masculine types.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.135
You really wanna think more workhorse
than show pony, if you catch my drift.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.220
Ladies, I--

02:17.429 --> 02:20.224
Thank you, honestly, for this initiative.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.268
But I just don't think
that my TV persona fits into--

02:23.352 --> 02:26.813
to any of these lady buckets.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.610
All right.
I was hoping it wouldn't come to this,

02:31.693 --> 02:36.240
but would it help you
at all visualize yourself

02:36.323 --> 02:39.243
if we organize some kind of photo shoot?

02:44.748 --> 02:45.749
Yes, that could be helpful.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.918
Just kidding,
I was dying for it to come to this.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.962
-Fidelia, it's go time. It's go time.
-Yep, yep.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.338
-When I say go time, you go.
-Yeah!

02:51.421 --> 02:52.506
This is so exciting.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.049
Okay. Yeah.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.015
Can someone tend to Grace, please?

03:03.892 --> 03:04.893
And Maria.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.692
-We're all agitated and for good reason.
-Yeah.

03:12.276 --> 03:16.029
Those were kitchen windows
that were broken last night.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.867
Martha Kinard found shards of glass
in her sugar bowl.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.744
That's on the family's breakfast table,
Carl.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.455
I don't live in that kind of world.
Do you?

03:25.539 --> 03:27.791
-Shards of glass in the family sugar bowl?
-No.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.462
What was I talking about?

03:33.505 --> 03:36.842
You were putting neighborhood watch duties
down the side there.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.345
And I'll put the days of the week
across the top.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.741
Okay, that one's obvious.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.035
…all week, man.
I've been dying to come down here.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.747
-All right, guys. Let's get it on.
-Okay.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.416
Gentlemen, what game are we playing?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.628
I mean, what game are you guys playing?
Hearts?

04:13.212 --> 04:14.296
Better not be hearts.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.797
'Cause I'll tell you what,
if it is hearts,

04:15.881 --> 04:17.925
there's no way
I am not gonna take all your money.

04:18.007 --> 04:20.594
We're not playing hearts.
We're playing poker.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.096
Good.

04:23.597 --> 04:27.267
Well, my job here is done.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.313
Not my job job.
I'm not, like, a janitor or anything.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.898
Actually, I set these up,

04:32.981 --> 04:35.067
-trying to get more people around here…
-Bam!

04:35.150 --> 04:36.151
…recycling and--

04:38.403 --> 04:39.321
Never mind.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.491
So, I will leave you guys to it.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.577
Just two more.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.663
What's that?

04:51.416 --> 04:52.417
Enjoy it. Have fun.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.800
-Right?
-Wow.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.345
Yeah?

05:06.515 --> 05:07.933
Honey, that is not you.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.145
No. No, no.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.989
-Yeah.
-No.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.328
You look like a she-devil, but old.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.124
Sheila, I can see your whole butt, Sheil.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.711
-Yeah? I'd like to apologize.
-Yeah, I think it's not the--

05:41.091 --> 05:41.925
Yeah.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.469
Yes.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.014
Yes? Okay.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.894
Now we're talking.

05:53.770 --> 05:54.771
Are you kidding me?

05:59.943 --> 06:03.071
If carpincho leather had lady parts
and a heart of gold,

06:03.155 --> 06:05.532
it would be you right now.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.075
This is it, right?

06:10.287 --> 06:12.039
You look super hot!

06:12.831 --> 06:14.208
Doesn't she look super hot?

06:14.875 --> 06:15.834
Yeah, for sure.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.336
Can you hold still now?

06:17.419 --> 06:20.088
These pictures
are for a fitness enterprise, sir.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.965
Well, they're gonna be
blurry pictures, ma'am.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.175
Don't you dare call her "ma'am."

06:23.884 --> 06:27.304
-Is "ma'am" an offensive term?
-To a woman dressed like that? Yeah.

06:29.681 --> 06:33.185
Can you do your moves at, like,
20% of the regular speed?

06:33.268 --> 06:34.102
Okay.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.148
Okay.

06:40.776 --> 06:43.195
You look so great. You look so good.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.043
I can't do this, Greta.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.087
Yep, I know what we need, handcuffs.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.505
-Fide--
-No. Jesus, no.

07:01.588 --> 07:05.342
This-- This whole outfit,
this look, it's not me. It's--

07:05.425 --> 07:07.219
I'm not this dark.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.179
Not out loud, at least.

07:10.973 --> 07:15.727
Hey, hey, you are sexy.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.271
I say that objectively.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.566
-My hour's almost up, so…
-Just take five minutes, okay?

07:20.649 --> 07:23.402
Okay, yeah, let's take five.
Let's take five, everybody.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.450
Easy return.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.292
"All progress depends
on the unreasonable man."

07:41.378 --> 07:44.006
Hey, hey, asshole! Why would you do that?

07:47.509 --> 07:48.510
Hey.

07:49.928 --> 07:50.929
Hey!

07:58.061 --> 08:00.397
Hey! Hey, asshole!

08:01.815 --> 08:04.693
You had it in the right bin.
Who would do that?

08:04.776 --> 08:07.279
Who would take it out of the right bin
and put it in the wrong bin?

08:07.905 --> 08:09.948
I know you can hear me. Hey!

08:11.283 --> 08:12.826
SEAFARER'S VILLAGE

08:14.411 --> 08:15.412
Hey!

08:18.290 --> 08:19.291
Hey, asshole!

08:25.422 --> 08:26.715
How did you get the address?

08:26.798 --> 08:28.675
Some friends at the club told me.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.303
Well, not exactly friends.
And they didn't tell me.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.806
They told each other in the steam room,
in heated whispers, but I was there.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.017
I'm excited for Rita's class.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.770
Hi. How are you?

08:40.270 --> 08:43.190
My name is Greta.
I'm friends with Diana Wallace.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.735
She-- S-Subtle.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.196
You, yes.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.113
You, no.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.534
Excuse me?
Who the hell do you think you are?

08:54.576 --> 08:56.370
-One sec, just--
-What?

08:56.453 --> 08:59.581
That was unconscionable,
the trench coat, the attitude?

08:59.665 --> 09:01.124
-Who gives a hoot?
-I do.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.461
-I'm not doing this without you.
-Hey, this is research, remember?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.422
We're here to clock the competition,
not join the club.

09:08.799 --> 09:11.718
Besides, I'd rather putter around
the Talbots down the street

09:11.802 --> 09:15.013
than suck in my stomach for an hour
with those sluts.

09:15.097 --> 09:17.474
So take good mental notes, yeah?

09:17.558 --> 09:18.892
I wanna hear all about it.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.610
And hang yourself.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.154
Look at yourself.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.283
Really look.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.286
Now shake it up. Up.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.498
You want to look like me.

09:42.791 --> 09:44.668
But I can't help you if you're lazy.

09:46.170 --> 09:50.090
Heels together, lift them up one inch.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.051
One inch.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.261
That is too high.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.639
Now down into the knees. Lower.

09:57.723 --> 10:02.561
Pull your pussy in and hold. Center.

10:03.061 --> 10:03.979
Beautiful.

10:05.022 --> 10:07.232
Did I just hear someone's pussy release?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.401
Tighten it up.

10:09.484 --> 10:12.237
Yes, and tuck.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.991
Tuck. Let's go, tuck.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.244
And tuck. Beautiful.

10:19.328 --> 10:22.956
Knees together, open and close.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.793
Open and close. Open and close.

10:26.877 --> 10:30.631
Now lift your hand off the bar.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.636
One inch, thank you.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.221
Beautiful.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.432
And now into whore's pose.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.194
Hey!

10:53.737 --> 10:54.863
Hey!

10:55.822 --> 10:59.409
Hey! I just wanted to--

10:59.493 --> 11:05.374
I wanted to tell you that newspapers,
they go in the middle bin. Okay?

11:05.457 --> 11:07.751
Are you-- Wait, what?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.127
Yeah, you had it right.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.672
And you took it from the right bin
and you put it in the wrong bin.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.215
I'm just telling you, you had it right.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.675
You live at Seafarer's Village?

11:14.758 --> 11:16.969
Not live there. I don't want
to be painted with that brush.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.387
But yeah, I'd stay there.

11:19.304 --> 11:22.349
You ran all the way from there
to here to tell me that?

11:22.933 --> 11:24.643
Yes, it's important. Okay?

11:24.726 --> 11:28.146
You needed to know that you had it--
You had it right.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.232
That's, like, three fucking miles, man.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.526
You ran all the way
from there to here just to tell me that?

11:34.403 --> 11:37.865
Yeah, you're damn right I did. Okay?
You needed to know.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.367
Okay?

11:40.868 --> 11:41.869
Okay.

11:42.953 --> 11:43.996
Okay.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.747
Okay.

11:47.457 --> 11:48.458
All right.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.421
Do not rise onto your toes.

11:52.504 --> 11:57.467
You are not dancers,
you just want to look like dancers.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.553
And hold,

12:01.180 --> 12:02.431
hold,

12:03.765 --> 12:04.766
hold.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.444
What is this fucking place?

12:17.654 --> 12:18.822
Pathetic.

12:18.906 --> 12:22.159
Hey, look at this cute little thing.
Give me a couple of twirls.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.702
Look how cute she is.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.042
Why don't you give us a couple twirls?
Nothing fancy.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.669
They're looking at your hoo-ha.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.630
You know that, right?

12:36.715 --> 12:39.760
You're not even here, are you?
Where did you go?

12:41.887 --> 12:44.389
You coming back? Hey! Hey!

12:51.396 --> 12:56.026
Coach Fairington
"Sprint to the field house."

13:25.597 --> 13:26.598
I needed that.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.643
I really needed that.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.532
Whose house was it this time?

13:45.367 --> 13:46.618
The Sandbergs'.

13:48.620 --> 13:49.663
Because they're Jewish?

13:50.706 --> 13:51.707
What?

13:52.666 --> 13:53.667
No.

13:54.543 --> 13:55.878
No, no.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.423
We know some Jewish people.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.885
So, that's not why
their windows got broken?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.262
No.

14:05.345 --> 14:09.766
Look, this destruction is going
to continue until someone stops it.

14:10.726 --> 14:17.274
Until someone finds
this piece of so-and-so

14:17.357 --> 14:18.859
and teaches them a lesson.

14:22.321 --> 14:26.533
Do I have permission to keep my BB gun
locked and loaded and at the ready?

14:28.619 --> 14:29.703
This is live-action.

14:30.996 --> 14:31.997
Yes, sir.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.431
What are you making?

14:50.057 --> 14:51.600
Spaghetti and meat sauce.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.936
We eat meat sauce again?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.604
Well, I was thinking, you know,

14:55.687 --> 14:57.856
just because Daddy and I decided
to go vegetarian

14:57.940 --> 15:00.400
doesn't mean you have to necessarily.

15:00.484 --> 15:01.985
I want you to decide for yourself.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.989
So, you want meat sauce
with your spaghetti?

15:08.700 --> 15:11.161
There you go. Deciding for yourself.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.914
Lucky girl, Maya.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.752
You know what, sweetie,
you can watch some TV

15:18.836 --> 15:21.129
until I'm done here. Okay? Ten minutes.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.051
You're starting to get pretty annoying.

15:27.094 --> 15:31.056
When are you gonna decide
for yourself what you want?

15:31.557 --> 15:33.809
Not just on that TV show,

15:33.892 --> 15:37.354
but are you a prim little vegetarian prude

15:37.437 --> 15:39.940
or are you a hungry meat-loving whore?

15:41.358 --> 15:42.776
I don't have to answer that.

16:08.427 --> 16:09.428
Wait.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.973
Why am I hiding? I'm not the wrongdoer.

16:14.266 --> 16:18.604
You're the wrongdoer,
you piece of so-and-so.

16:23.192 --> 16:25.611
What are you doing?

16:26.445 --> 16:27.446
Maria.

16:29.907 --> 16:30.741
Shit!

16:31.408 --> 16:33.243
Maria, language.

16:33.327 --> 16:34.870
Get that flashlight out of my eyes!

16:37.748 --> 16:41.251
It's-- It's been you this whole--

16:43.587 --> 16:45.881
That's a lot of windows
you smashed, Maria.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.842
I'm sorry for using the S-word.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.553
It's okay.

16:51.637 --> 16:52.930
Not for the windows.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.307
What am I supposed--

16:57.226 --> 16:59.186
Why have you been doing this?

17:00.479 --> 17:02.105
Because I'm miserable.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.608
I know it's been difficult.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.403
-With the baby.
-Not with the baby.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.241
With everything, everyone but Grace.

17:13.157 --> 17:16.619
With you. With your insufferable aunts.
With--

17:17.119 --> 17:20.582
Misery doesn't need reasons, John.
You of all people should know that.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.841
Give me the brick, Maria.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.014
Maria.

17:39.393 --> 17:42.938
I know it's not my turn to share
but I have something to talk about.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.648
There's a sign-up sheet for a reason.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.567
I know, I know. But--

17:46.650 --> 17:48.777
-It's for this reason.
-I know, but I--

17:48.861 --> 17:50.153
This exact type of reason.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.366
Let her fucking talk, will you?

17:58.537 --> 18:02.249
I was molested when I was, like,
barely a teenager.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.170
Taken advantage of, raped,
I don't know the word.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.337
All of them really apply.

18:07.421 --> 18:11.675
But it was a friend of my father's,
this guy I'd known my whole life.

18:12.467 --> 18:16.263
And it would be, you know,
living rooms at Christmas time

18:16.346 --> 18:18.599
or in the backyard, Fourth of July.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.810
And he would always ask me
about my ballet.

18:22.311 --> 18:26.773
Ask me to, you know,
do a couple of twirls, a couple of pliés.

18:26.857 --> 18:27.858
Nothing fancy.

18:29.318 --> 18:30.319
Penché.

18:30.819 --> 18:35.240
And anyway, it just-- It all--
This pain and this fury

18:35.324 --> 18:37.743
just came rushing back to me
at this ballet class that I took.

18:37.826 --> 18:39.536
I mean, it wasn't really
a ballet class actually,

18:39.620 --> 18:41.538
it was more
like this fitness class based--

18:42.039 --> 18:44.750
That doesn't matter.
I don't know why I'm talking about that.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.629
-Sorry. I'm sorry. I just--
-Hey, come on.

18:49.254 --> 18:52.382
It all came back to me
in a second in that hall of mirrors,

18:52.466 --> 18:54.760
and I wanted to get out of there so bad.

18:54.843 --> 18:58.805
And I just wanted to go to
that fucking burger joint, to be honest,

18:58.889 --> 18:59.890
but I didn't.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.226
What'd you do instead?

19:03.477 --> 19:08.607
I-- I-- I cooked my daughter dinner,

19:08.690 --> 19:12.653
I went to bed, I slept like shit
and came here and talked about it.

19:14.780 --> 19:19.785
For, you know, the first time
to anyone other than family.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.328
So--

19:23.288 --> 19:24.915
So, that's something, I suppose.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.751
You're damn right it is.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.963
What did you make her for dinner?

19:32.130 --> 19:32.965
What?

19:33.465 --> 19:35.717
Your daughter, what did you make her?

19:39.888 --> 19:41.265
Spaghetti and meat sauce.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.184
Yum. Sounds delicious.

19:44.268 --> 19:45.352
Yeah.

19:48.856 --> 19:51.984
Hey, are you good?
You're good. This is good. This is you.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.318
Yeah, I'll be right outside.

19:57.781 --> 19:59.074
You are good.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.451
You are good and you are grateful.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.371
You have everything you need.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.333
Just go out there and be honest.

20:09.626 --> 20:10.627
Be yourself.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.964
You know what I'm gonna say
about that, right?

20:14.548 --> 20:16.466
Nobody wants you to be yourself.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.431
So your dad's buddy was kind of
a creep to you a long time ago,

20:23.182 --> 20:24.183
join the club.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.475
Get what I'm saying?

20:25.559 --> 20:26.810
You just take that feeling

20:26.894 --> 20:29.605
and you just bury it deep, deep,
deep inside you.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.110
I didn't mean to upset you, sweetie.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.070
I'm just trying to protect you.

20:37.654 --> 20:41.200
'Cause out there, if you let people see
that soft side of you,

20:41.283 --> 20:44.870
they'll put you on an ice floe
and leave you there to die.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.875
All right, Sheila. Are you ready?

20:49.958 --> 20:52.419
Oh, yes, I certainly am.

20:57.591 --> 21:02.221
I'm Sheila D. Rubin, the newest member
of the Wake Up San Diego team.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.264
I'll be bringing you a new segment

21:04.348 --> 21:07.017
once a week called
Waking Up with Sheila.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.520
Today's segment is an exciting one.

21:10.187 --> 21:14.191
We're gonna be talking about warming up
our muscles before we work out.

21:14.775 --> 21:19.821
"Is that important?" You might ask. Well,
it sure is. And I'm gonna show you why.
