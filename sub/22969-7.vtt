00:08.150 --> 00:09.420
What do you mean he's gone?

00:12.290 --> 00:14.160
Flynn has left The Library.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.890
- But he's coming back, right?
- No.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.160
He always comes back.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.490
I mean, he leaves, he
makes everybody crazy,

00:19.500 --> 00:21.900
- but then he comes back.
- Not this time.

00:21.900 --> 00:22.970
What makes you so sure?

00:22.970 --> 00:25.430
Because he's never
resigned before.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.100
You don't think he's off
with Nicole, do you?

00:27.100 --> 00:28.700
- Why would you say that?
- Sorry.

00:28.710 --> 00:31.370
He's not off with Nicole,
he's off because of Nicole.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.440
Because what
The Library did to her,

00:33.440 --> 00:34.840
because The Library lied to him.

00:34.850 --> 00:37.580
Or because of something
Darrington Dare said to him.

00:37.580 --> 00:41.580
He told Flynn that there could
only be one Librarian at a time.

00:41.590 --> 00:43.850
He said if there were
ever any more than one,

00:43.850 --> 00:45.850
eventually they would all
try and kill one another.

00:45.860 --> 00:47.990
He said it happened once before
and it led to the Dark Ages.

00:47.990 --> 00:50.990
And if we continue
with more than one Librarian,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.660
at some point we'll meet
an equally horrible fate.

00:53.660 --> 00:55.730
He did the only noble thing.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.330
He's not about to ask
one of us to quit,

00:57.330 --> 00:59.400
- so he lead by example.
- Which means what?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.810
That of the three of us left...

01:02.810 --> 01:04.010
two more need to resign.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:15.750 --> 01:18.350
I mean, now that
I don't have the tumor

01:18.360 --> 01:20.290
and the threat of death
hanging over my head,

01:20.290 --> 01:23.290
I have... wondered
what a normal life

01:23.290 --> 01:25.560
outside The Library
might be like.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.230
And I always thought
that I'd fall in love,

01:27.230 --> 01:28.830
maybe settle down.

01:28.830 --> 01:32.170
I mean, staying here,
that would be giving that up.

01:32.170 --> 01:35.040
Guys, it's gonna be all right.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.240
You two should just quit

01:36.240 --> 01:38.170
and I should be
the one true Librarian.

01:38.180 --> 01:39.240
It just makes sense.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.980
- No!
- Are you kidding me?

01:42.450 --> 01:44.650
Why are you yelling?

01:44.650 --> 01:47.380
Jenkins, are you okay?

01:47.380 --> 01:48.920
I don't think I've ever
seen you sick before.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.320
Mm, that's because
I've never been sick before.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.260
How do you mortal...

01:54.260 --> 01:59.130
us mortals deal
with being... mortal?

02:00.930 --> 02:02.600
One has to sleep and eat.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.870
What's the deal with poop?

02:04.870 --> 02:05.930
It's too much.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.870
Uh, maybe you should
just quit, too.

02:07.870 --> 02:09.669
I mean, Baird and I can
handle the Library stuff.

02:09.669 --> 02:12.470
- It's fine.
- Nobody's putting
you in charge, Jones.

02:12.480 --> 02:13.880
- If anybody stays...
- What?

02:13.880 --> 02:15.340
I guess it's got to be me.

02:15.350 --> 02:16.480
Why wouldn't it be me?

02:16.480 --> 02:18.150
When it comes
to magical knowledge,

02:18.150 --> 02:19.280
I'm as close to Jenkins as...

02:19.280 --> 02:22.420
I am The Librarian!
I will miss you!

02:22.420 --> 02:24.820
No one is quitting the Library.

02:24.820 --> 02:25.890
What about Flynn?

02:25.890 --> 02:30.360
Flynn was wrong, okay?

02:30.360 --> 02:32.630
The Library invited each of you.

02:32.630 --> 02:37.030
And as far as I know,
The Library has not rescinded
any of those invitations!

02:37.030 --> 02:38.330
That doesn't bother you?

02:39.900 --> 02:42.570
That Flynn's gone?

02:42.570 --> 02:45.070
Even a little bit?

02:48.380 --> 02:49.750
We need to stick together.

02:50.710 --> 02:52.510
We need to get back to work.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.580
We need to get back
to who we are.

02:54.590 --> 02:58.190
Just dig in here...
and get going.

02:58.190 --> 03:02.120
Salvation through action.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.860
Oh, ho, ho!

03:04.860 --> 03:09.530
And I think I found exactly
what we're looking for.

03:09.530 --> 03:12.400
<i>♪ Summer camp is tons of fun ♪</i>

03:12.400 --> 03:13.800
Team building camp?

03:13.800 --> 03:16.400
Robbie Bender's
Team Building Camp.

03:16.410 --> 03:18.410
<i>♪ So shout out, cheer,

03:18.410 --> 03:22.010
"World's most successful

03:22.010 --> 03:23.810
From Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs

03:23.810 --> 03:25.880
to professional sports teams,

03:25.880 --> 03:29.150
Robbie Bender has taught
every kind of team how
to meet the challenge

03:29.150 --> 03:31.550
"of being
a winning organization."

03:31.560 --> 03:34.620
- Yeah!
- Oh, I hate camp.

03:34.630 --> 03:36.890
In fact, I'm gonna just
try and meet the challenge

03:36.890 --> 03:38.960
this weekend of getting
as much sleep as possible.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.600
Starting now.

03:42.030 --> 03:43.300
The Clipping Book didn't
give us one clue

03:43.300 --> 03:44.830
of why it's sending us here?

03:44.840 --> 03:47.640
Maybe it's karma.
Maybe it could sense
that we needed it.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.100
No, the book doesn't
work like that.

03:49.110 --> 03:51.440
Something must be going on
for it to send us there.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.110
And while we're there,
we're not just going
to investigate,

03:54.110 --> 03:55.510
we're gonna participate.

03:55.510 --> 03:56.710
It's time our team

03:56.710 --> 03:57.880
to be a team again!

03:59.180 --> 04:01.320
I love camp. I've never been.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.190
You love it, you never been?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.399
<i>♪ Summer camp is tons of fun ♪</i>

04:17.399 --> 04:19.870
What? What?

04:19.870 --> 04:22.000

04:22.010 --> 04:24.940

04:42.890 --> 04:44.760
I thought people were
sent to places like this

04:44.760 --> 04:46.630
when they've done
something wrong.

04:46.630 --> 04:47.830
The Libris Corporation,
am I right?

04:47.830 --> 04:49.030
Yes!

04:49.030 --> 04:50.700
Thanks for squeezing
us in last-minute.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.830
You guys got lucky.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.100
The Barriston Industries
group had to cancel.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.240
Hostile takeover.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.640
Should have come to us sooner.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.240
Like an old familiar song

04:59.240 --> 05:00.640
or a nostalgic memory,

05:00.640 --> 05:04.380
being at camp reignites
a special part of us.

05:04.380 --> 05:05.780
Over the course of this weekend,

05:05.780 --> 05:07.920
we will have a number
of inter-team contests

05:07.920 --> 05:12.520
to see who it is who is best
at adopting the B.T.T.
principles.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.990
I'm Robbie Bender,

05:13.990 --> 05:17.130
this is
my transformational system

05:17.130 --> 05:19.330
of personality unity.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.860
Welcome to Camp!

05:20.870 --> 05:25.130
Whoo!

05:25.140 --> 05:26.800
Please. Thank you.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.340
Everything
you do here at camp
will be designed

05:29.340 --> 05:32.880
to strengthen your abilities
to work together.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.050
First team to reach
their cabin wins!

05:38.750 --> 05:40.010
Doesn't say where our cabin is.

05:40.020 --> 05:41.950
You have been given
your assignments,

05:41.950 --> 05:44.750
but only if you can
work together.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.290
I usually like
to start at the back

05:47.290 --> 05:49.090
and work my way up.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.690
It's a game!

05:50.690 --> 05:52.230
Bring it in, bring it in,
we got this, we got this.

05:52.230 --> 05:54.360
- What to do? What to do?
- It's in that weird syntax.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.630
"You've been given
your assignments."
That means something.

05:56.630 --> 05:58.100
Given. What have we been given?

05:58.100 --> 05:59.700
- The brochures?
- Start from the back.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.240
Read the back, read the back...

06:01.240 --> 06:03.310
Let me see yours.
Yes, that's it. Look at this.

06:03.310 --> 06:04.970
This word right here, okay?
In the small print.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.980
Mine says, "By being energized."

06:06.980 --> 06:08.580
His says... what does
yours say, man?

06:08.580 --> 06:09.980
His says, "By being unwavering."

06:09.980 --> 06:11.710
- "Loyal."
- Mine's "bold."

06:11.720 --> 06:14.650
Energized, unwavering,
loyal, bold.

06:14.650 --> 06:16.520
First letters E-U-L-B.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.790
Guys, shouldn't we be
looking for, like, an
artifact or a mystery?

06:18.790 --> 06:20.720
- B-L-U-E.
- Blue, blue,
blue, blue, blue!

06:20.720 --> 06:23.460
Blue! It's the blue cabin!

06:23.460 --> 06:25.590
Aah!

06:34.270 --> 06:36.270
High-five!

06:45.550 --> 06:46.950
Winning is a result.

06:46.950 --> 06:49.280
Team building is a process.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.950
I always like to say that
the most important decision
you can make

06:51.960 --> 06:54.490
every day is to be
in a good mood.

06:54.490 --> 06:56.630
- Yeah, so did Voltaire.
- Ooh.

06:56.630 --> 06:59.360
Now today, we are celebrating

06:59.360 --> 07:03.030
our six-month anniversary
here at Camp B.T.T.

07:03.030 --> 07:05.700
And because of our
unprecedented record,

07:05.700 --> 07:08.170
100% success rate,

07:08.170 --> 07:12.370
we are preparing
to expand our campus.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.340
Sally, take it away!

07:15.510 --> 07:17.250
Whoo! Yeah!

07:22.190 --> 07:25.850
Now, a forest is not made up
of individual trees,

07:25.860 --> 07:28.460
it is one organism.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.590
A team.

07:29.590 --> 07:31.990
The root systems of Aspen Groves

07:32.000 --> 07:33.730
are literally interconnected.

07:33.730 --> 07:36.130
That is why we chose this site.

07:36.130 --> 07:37.670
And speaking of our team,

07:37.670 --> 07:40.870
I want to welcome our staff
to the stage!

07:40.870 --> 07:42.470
Come on down, guys!

07:42.470 --> 07:45.370
Here they are.

07:46.540 --> 07:50.650
Whoo! Yeah!

07:54.220 --> 07:58.550
Now, they will be here
to assist with our program,

07:58.560 --> 08:00.020
to rebuild,

08:00.020 --> 08:03.560
to reshape, to refresh.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.160
Our program begins this evening

08:06.160 --> 08:09.230
after dinner
with a campfire
marshmallow roast

08:09.230 --> 08:10.700
at Teepee Hill.

08:10.700 --> 08:12.770
Yeah!

08:12.770 --> 08:16.640
Whoo! All right! Yeah! Whoo!

08:16.640 --> 08:18.170
Come on.

08:23.310 --> 08:26.520
Long before the white man
stepped foot in these lands,

08:26.520 --> 08:30.790
the local people believed
this forest to be haunted.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.919
They called it "duhubite",

08:32.919 --> 08:35.659
which in Shoshone means "Hell."

08:35.659 --> 08:39.330
Mm, no. It means
"black" or "dark."

08:39.330 --> 08:41.130
So upon their arrival,

08:41.130 --> 08:45.470
the first settlers
to step into these woods

08:45.470 --> 08:49.140
were beset... by ghosts!

08:55.480 --> 08:56.880
Really, Cassandra?

09:01.620 --> 09:03.620
Hey, Sally?

09:03.620 --> 09:05.550
I noticed when the Menford
Electric group arrived,

09:05.560 --> 09:06.560
there were eight of them.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.360
Now there's only six.

09:08.360 --> 09:09.760
Yeah, that happens.

09:09.760 --> 09:11.490
Bender calls them
the weak links,

09:11.500 --> 09:12.830
says it's good they're gone.

09:12.830 --> 09:15.560
It keeps our success
record perfect.

09:15.570 --> 09:16.770
They just disappear?

09:16.770 --> 09:18.630
Well, vanished.

09:18.640 --> 09:21.040
How many times
has that happened?

09:21.040 --> 09:23.440
Okay, you didn't
hear this from me,

09:23.440 --> 09:25.840
but at least a dozen
since I've been here.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.040
Really is pretty weird.

09:29.050 --> 09:30.780
No one even sees them leave.

09:30.780 --> 09:33.050
Just... gone.

09:38.390 --> 09:40.050
Guys...

09:40.060 --> 09:42.260
I think I know why
the Clipping Book
sent us here.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.460
The plank races...

09:49.470 --> 09:53.070
is the first test of
your team's cohesiveness.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.940
Remember,
like Robbie Bender said,

09:55.940 --> 09:57.810
it's not about winning,
it's about the process.

09:57.810 --> 09:59.610
It's about getting
back to that...

09:59.610 --> 10:01.010
Old-timey feeling.

10:01.010 --> 10:02.210
Commitment!

10:02.210 --> 10:04.010
Commitment... to each other.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.550
Are you sure
you're talking about us?

10:05.550 --> 10:07.280
Guys, we got this, okay?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.680
On three, "Libris."
One, two, three, Libris!

10:09.690 --> 10:10.750
- Libris!
- Libris.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.020
Okay, on three. Jones?

10:13.020 --> 10:14.360
All right, it's okay!

10:14.360 --> 10:15.490
It's okay, we got this.
Let's go!

10:16.960 --> 10:19.230
Ah! I really hate that whistle!

10:19.230 --> 10:21.300
The team that goes fastest

10:21.300 --> 10:23.970
is the team
that can work together

10:23.970 --> 10:26.170
with the best coordination.

10:26.170 --> 10:28.570
All right,
I should be in back.
Stone, you get in front.

10:28.570 --> 10:31.370
Remember, this event
will reward the team

10:31.370 --> 10:34.710
that can act as one organism.

10:34.710 --> 10:38.050
That can feed off one hive mind.

10:38.050 --> 10:40.720
No me-firsters need apply!

10:40.720 --> 10:41.920
Get ready.

10:41.920 --> 10:42.920
One organism.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.450
- Hive mind.
- Okay.

10:44.460 --> 10:47.120
Get set, go!

10:48.060 --> 10:49.930
Left foot, huh! Right foot, huh!

10:49.930 --> 10:52.460
One, two, three, four...

10:52.460 --> 10:53.730
Come on, guys pick it up!

10:53.730 --> 10:55.200
I feel like a caterpillar!

10:55.200 --> 10:57.270
On a triple macchiato!

10:57.270 --> 10:59.870
Come on, guys! Two, push!

10:59.870 --> 11:01.070
Push! One, two...

11:01.070 --> 11:02.600
Did she just say, "mush?"

11:02.610 --> 11:04.010
Together! Follow me!

11:04.010 --> 11:05.140
That's right.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.940
Go!

11:06.940 --> 11:10.750
...three, four!
One, two, three four.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.750
One, two...

11:11.750 --> 11:14.280
- No, no, no, no!
- Yeah!

11:14.290 --> 11:15.750
Yeah!

11:15.750 --> 11:17.350
- No.
- Way to go, team.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.820
You guys!

11:20.820 --> 11:22.960
Don't you even
care about winning?

11:22.960 --> 11:24.030
I thought it wasn't
about winning.

11:24.030 --> 11:26.230
It's not, it's about caring.

11:26.230 --> 11:29.100
Are we forgetting that
we're supposed to be
solving a mystery?

11:29.100 --> 11:32.400
I mean, everyone here
is turning into teenagers.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.570
When did I become the adult?

11:33.570 --> 11:34.570
You're right.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.770
It's elective time,

11:35.770 --> 11:37.710
and I'm gonna go
find out what's up...

11:37.710 --> 11:39.480
with the Helmridge Group.

11:41.980 --> 11:45.650
Hey. That was the counselor
that was talking about
the disappearing people.

11:45.650 --> 11:48.450
- I'll see what
I can find out.
- No, no, no, I got it.

11:48.450 --> 11:51.120
Arts and creativity,
language arts.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.450
Guys, hello?

11:54.130 --> 11:57.860
Which means you and I
have elective time!

11:57.860 --> 12:01.530
So the idea that creativity
flows from the individual ego

12:01.530 --> 12:04.800
is challenged
by group creations
of Sanskrit poets,

12:04.800 --> 12:07.670
African tribal art.

12:07.670 --> 12:09.070
But in the modern world,

12:09.070 --> 12:11.540
often team members
won't contribute

12:11.540 --> 12:12.540
because of...

12:15.680 --> 12:17.410
...fear.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.350
Nerves.

12:18.350 --> 12:21.350
The ability to relax
in stressful a situation

12:21.350 --> 12:23.550
is key to unleashing creativity.

12:23.550 --> 12:26.560
Often, to relax,
I think of a poem.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.290
A lullaby.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.090
"Golden slumbers kiss your eyes."

12:31.090 --> 12:33.430
Smiles awake you when you rise.

12:33.430 --> 12:35.960
"Sleep, pretty wantons,
do not cry..."

12:35.970 --> 12:38.900
"And I will sing a lullaby.

12:38.900 --> 12:43.270
Rock them, rock them, lullaby."

12:45.840 --> 12:47.180
Why, yes.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.440
That's right.

12:48.450 --> 12:51.310
Thomas Dekker?

12:51.310 --> 12:54.780
You're a fan of
17th century poetry?

12:54.790 --> 12:57.050
Actually, I'm a Beatles fan.

12:57.050 --> 13:00.460
When I found out they
used one of his poems,
I looked him up.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.520
Right.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.790
Kind of fell in love
with his writing.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.660
Made me want to write.

13:05.660 --> 13:07.400
Changed my life.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.660
Love can do that.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.540
It's true.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.070
Love is magical.

13:17.670 --> 13:19.010
Do you believe in magic?

13:19.010 --> 13:20.540
Actually, I do.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.680
Good.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.780
'Cause I don't think
I'd like you as much
if you didn't.

13:31.150 --> 13:32.590
Are you teaching
another class today?

13:34.430 --> 13:38.030
I think I'm gonna go back
to my cabin for a nap.

13:38.030 --> 13:40.130
Maybe I'll see you
this afternoon.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.430
I'm not taking a side.

13:43.430 --> 13:46.640
I'm just saying our firm
has represented lawsuits

13:46.640 --> 13:48.300
around deforesting.

13:48.310 --> 13:51.110
You have to have an
environmental impact
study done

13:51.110 --> 13:53.710
before you commit to
expanding the camp.

13:53.710 --> 13:54.640
You know what, Duke?

13:54.650 --> 13:57.250
Your team went down
15 minutes ago.

13:57.250 --> 13:58.980
You should've been with them.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.120
Okay, Ezekiel, it's your turn.

14:11.190 --> 14:15.330
Woohoo! You did it! Yes!

14:15.330 --> 14:17.000
Okay, Ezekiel. We got you.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.530
Wasn't that great?

14:18.540 --> 14:20.470
Yeah. Usually
when I'm doing that,

14:20.470 --> 14:23.140
there are prized jewels
for me to steal
on the other side.

14:23.140 --> 14:24.540
What is the point in all this?

14:24.540 --> 14:25.870
It's fun!

14:25.880 --> 14:27.740
Camp fun! Fun fun.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.550
This is not fun for me.
This is work.

14:33.550 --> 14:36.420
And speaking of work,
we should be out there
hunting for clues,

14:36.420 --> 14:38.820
and we're not gonna find any
messing around here.

14:43.830 --> 14:45.590
Hey, where did he go?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.520
Oh, my God, are you all right?

15:14.530 --> 15:16.130
Yeah. Yeah.

15:16.130 --> 15:18.060
What were you doing up there?

15:18.060 --> 15:19.330
You said you were
gonna take a nap,

15:19.330 --> 15:22.260
so I thought that
I would just, um...

15:22.270 --> 15:23.670
check out the trees.

15:23.670 --> 15:26.270
Oh.

15:26.270 --> 15:27.340
Me, too.

15:27.340 --> 15:29.170
Would you want to
do it together?

15:36.810 --> 15:37.850
Sure.

15:41.890 --> 15:43.820
- Mm.
- Sounds fun.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.290
Right through there. Looks good.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.960
All right, I want to make sure

15:54.970 --> 15:56.170
we cover this
whole area, people.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.970
Don't miss a spot.

15:57.970 --> 16:00.600
Who are these guys?

16:32.140 --> 16:34.870
Military-grade locks?

16:55.960 --> 16:57.830
Hold it right there...

17:02.830 --> 17:04.800
Colonel Eve Baird.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.069
tion sensor

17:12.079 --> 17:13.540
and now is caught.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.940
Maybe not so great after all.

17:15.950 --> 17:17.349
You've heard of me?

17:17.349 --> 17:19.480
That's all we ever hear about.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.280
"Eve Baird wouldn't
have done it that way."

17:21.290 --> 17:23.290
Eve Baird would have
figured it out by now.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.420
"Eve Baird wouldn't have
driven into the swamp."

17:26.420 --> 17:28.220
You know, I'm so
sick of hearing about you!

17:28.230 --> 17:30.160
You guys aren't
from a hedge fund.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.700
Duh!

17:34.160 --> 17:35.500
DOSA.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.170
Agent Tannen, Department
of Statistical Anomalies.

17:39.170 --> 17:40.170
What are you guys doing here?

17:40.170 --> 17:41.640
What are you guys doing here?

17:41.640 --> 17:42.970
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

17:42.970 --> 17:44.370
We know there must be
some kind of magical anomaly

17:44.380 --> 17:45.840
or the Library
wouldn't have sent us.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.440
Don't play coy with me, Baird.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.510
You broke into our cabin.

17:48.510 --> 17:50.250
You knew exactly who we are.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.250
Honestly, I didn't.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.580
But now that I do,

17:52.580 --> 17:54.320
let's work together
and try and figure out

17:54.320 --> 17:55.780
why these people
keep disappearing.

17:55.790 --> 17:58.450
People are disappearing?

17:58.460 --> 17:59.720
Seriously,
you've been here
for three months

17:59.720 --> 18:01.390
and didn't know that
people were disappearing?

18:01.390 --> 18:03.460
Well, yeah, we knew.

18:03.460 --> 18:05.260
You... you just tell us
what you know.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.930
That is everything I know!

18:06.930 --> 18:09.330
Our mystery
is trying to figure out
what the mystery is.

18:09.330 --> 18:10.930
Oh, you are clever, Baird.

18:10.940 --> 18:13.600
But we're not falling
for your playing dumb ploy.

18:13.600 --> 18:15.870
We're on the same team, Tannen.

18:15.870 --> 18:16.940
No.

18:18.340 --> 18:20.210
Our team is in here.

18:20.210 --> 18:22.680
And your team... is out there.

18:28.750 --> 18:32.620
So, do you make a habit
of following people?

18:32.620 --> 18:34.420
I do when they say
they're gonna take a nap

18:34.420 --> 18:36.390
and sneak off into the woods.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.330
You said you believed in magic.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.500
Is that true or were you
just flirting?

18:48.440 --> 18:50.510
Well, I...

18:50.510 --> 18:53.710
I mean, romance and magic,
they kind of go together,
don't they?

18:53.710 --> 18:57.180
I don't know why,
but I feel like
I can trust you.

18:57.180 --> 18:58.650
You can.

18:58.650 --> 19:00.380
I'm not a creative
expressions teacher.

19:00.380 --> 19:02.450
Yeah, I kind of figured that
when you mispronounced

19:02.450 --> 19:04.020
your favorite Russian muralist.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.590
Yeah.

19:07.590 --> 19:09.320
I'm not a very good liar.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.330
But I am a good reporter.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.000
At least, I was
before I got fired.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
What'd you get fired for?

19:20.000 --> 19:24.070
Look, I'm not crazy.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.670
I'm not a conspiracy nut.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.810
I don't believe in UFOs.

19:27.810 --> 19:31.480
But there have been
enough incidents in
the last several years

19:31.480 --> 19:34.150
to make a real case for
magic existing in our world

19:34.150 --> 19:36.020
and for people using that magic

19:36.020 --> 19:37.420
for their own personal gains.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.220
So you wrote about it?

19:39.220 --> 19:41.960
I tried.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.230
I was laughed
right out of the newsroom.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.090
I lost my job,

19:46.100 --> 19:47.830
my reputation,

19:47.830 --> 19:50.370
everything I had
worked so hard for.

19:50.370 --> 19:52.500
They fired you for
writing about magic?

19:53.970 --> 19:57.370
They fired me because
I wrote about The Library.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.850
I discovered a secret society,
decades, maybe centuries old,

20:04.850 --> 20:07.320
that houses and procures
magical artifacts

20:07.320 --> 20:09.050
called "The Library."

20:09.050 --> 20:10.850
I know how all that sounds.

20:10.860 --> 20:14.460
And you think The Library
is here in the forest?

20:14.460 --> 20:17.460
I uncovered a secret
black ops organization

20:17.460 --> 20:19.990
within the U.S.
government called DOSA.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.630
My sources tell me they work
hand in hand with The Library.

20:24.740 --> 20:26.130
And you think
they're at this camp?

20:26.140 --> 20:28.140
I intercepted
an internal communication.

20:28.140 --> 20:31.340
I figure if they're here,
maybe they can lead me
to The Library.

20:31.340 --> 20:33.210
If I can prove
that The Library exists,

20:33.210 --> 20:35.740
I would be
completely vindicated.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.950
I could show them
I'm not a lunatic.

20:42.490 --> 20:43.490
I'm sorry.

20:43.490 --> 20:45.090
I said too much.

20:45.090 --> 20:46.890
I'm so sorry.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.570
Damn splinter.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.180
This is bloody hard.

21:10.180 --> 21:11.510
Don't get frustrated.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.720
Here, have a drink.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.650
Did you hear
another camper vanished?

21:16.650 --> 21:19.520
Probably one
of those me-firsters.

21:19.520 --> 21:20.720
Did you hear that?

21:20.730 --> 21:23.660
Another one. Sorry.

21:23.660 --> 21:25.060
I'm just really tired.
I think it's the altitude.

21:25.060 --> 21:28.030
Maybe you should go back
to our cabin and take a nap.

21:29.270 --> 21:30.570
What are you up to?

21:32.070 --> 21:34.270
Nothing.

21:34.270 --> 21:35.670
I just want you to feel better

21:35.670 --> 21:38.040
so we can solve
mysteries together.

21:40.210 --> 21:42.680
Right? Go! Go, go, go.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.250
Go, go. Take a nap.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.300
<i>♪ Summer camp is tons of fun ♪</i>

22:06.300 --> 22:09.040
<i>♪ Get ready for lots of sun ♪</i>

22:09.040 --> 22:10.440
- <i>♪ So shout out, cheer</i>
- Cassandra!

22:10.440 --> 22:12.510
<i>♪ Summer's here</i>

22:12.510 --> 22:13.980
<i>♪ And camp's the best part

22:13.980 --> 22:15.580
It's not funny!

22:15.580 --> 22:19.510
It's funny. It is very funny.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.650
What the hell
is the matter with you?

22:21.650 --> 22:23.990
Does this camp just sap
everybody's maturity
or something?

22:23.990 --> 22:27.190
Oh, come on, it's just a prank.

22:27.190 --> 22:28.990
You gave me a sleeping potion.

22:28.990 --> 22:32.730
Just a little minor magic
spell from Dr. Malifici's

22:32.730 --> 22:34.330
little book of
little white spells.

22:34.330 --> 22:35.330
What are you doing, Cassandra?

22:35.330 --> 22:36.730
Do you think I like this?

22:36.730 --> 22:38.930
I mean, don't you?
Come on, just a little bit?

22:38.940 --> 22:41.940
No! Why would you think that?

22:41.940 --> 22:44.210
The movies.

22:44.210 --> 22:45.210
Like, camp movies.

22:45.210 --> 22:46.610
I mean, pranks.

22:46.610 --> 22:48.040
Everybody laughs.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.880
This is your problem, Cassandra.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.280
You've never lived
in the real world.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.280
You've only experienced
everyday life in fiction.

22:55.290 --> 22:58.820
Your world has been
studying and The Library.

22:58.820 --> 23:00.890
You actually have no idea

23:00.890 --> 23:04.090
what normal people do
or think or like!

23:05.430 --> 23:07.100
Maybe you're right.

23:08.630 --> 23:10.170
Maybe I don't know
what normal life is.

23:10.170 --> 23:13.640
Yeah? Well, maybe
you ought to find out!

23:13.640 --> 23:15.100
- Aah!
- Oh!

23:28.390 --> 23:29.920
What is that?

23:29.920 --> 23:32.720
Can't get this damned splinter.

24:10.030 --> 24:11.830
You guys aren't gonna believe
what I have to tell you!

24:11.830 --> 24:13.160
You're not going to believe
what I have to show you!

24:13.160 --> 24:14.960
- The guys in that cabin...
- This briefcase...

24:14.970 --> 24:17.900
- ...they're DOSA!
- Hey!

24:17.900 --> 24:19.800
You guys are not
gonna believe this.

24:21.310 --> 24:22.770
So what do we know?

24:22.770 --> 24:24.010
Well, we know the
Clipping Book sent us here,

24:24.010 --> 24:25.170
but we don't know why.

24:25.180 --> 24:26.910
We know that people
are disappearing.

24:26.910 --> 24:29.910
Yanked away mysteriously
by a bunch of vines
and branches.

24:29.910 --> 24:31.050
And DOSA knows something

24:31.050 --> 24:32.920
that the Clipping Book
didn't tell us.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.580
So these people
who are disappearing,

24:34.590 --> 24:36.180
why them?

24:36.190 --> 24:40.050
More importantly,
who is making them disappear?

24:40.060 --> 24:42.660
May I have
your attention, please?

24:42.660 --> 24:44.060
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.800
I have an announcement
of another departure

24:46.800 --> 24:48.400
of a weak link.

24:48.400 --> 24:53.200
A camper from the Kellog team,
Duke Kellog, has left us.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.940
Apparently, he felt...
what did he say?

24:55.940 --> 24:58.140
"Suppressed
by all the team talk."

24:58.140 --> 25:00.010
Ego, right?

25:00.010 --> 25:02.680
You are so better off
without him.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.880
No me-firsters!

25:03.880 --> 25:05.410
I will see you later!

25:05.420 --> 25:06.410
All right!

25:06.420 --> 25:08.350
Whoo!

25:08.350 --> 25:09.880
Duke Kellog?

25:09.890 --> 25:12.150
The initials on
the suitcase were D.K.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.820
Who throws
their luggage in a pond

25:13.820 --> 25:15.620
before they split for home?

25:15.630 --> 25:18.330
I think we have a suspect.

25:21.630 --> 25:23.300
We need five minutes.

25:23.300 --> 25:24.830
- Ten tops.
- Okay.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.700
- I don't know about this.
- Follow my lead.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.770
Remember, I've seen
"Band Camp" four times.

25:28.770 --> 25:31.770
Good morning,
Camp Director Bender!

25:31.780 --> 25:33.980
Not my title, but good morning.

25:33.980 --> 25:35.710
Are you enjoying
your B.T.T. experience?

25:35.710 --> 25:38.780
Absolutely!

25:38.780 --> 25:41.050
We have an idea, though,
how you can make it

25:41.050 --> 25:43.250
a little bit more amazing.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.390
Really? Well,
I'd ask you into my office,

25:45.390 --> 25:47.190
but I'm doing a little
reorganizing right now...

25:47.190 --> 25:48.590
Actually, we were
hoping you could

25:48.590 --> 25:49.860
come with us
to the amphitheater.

25:49.860 --> 25:51.730
Oh, I'm sorry, champ.

25:51.730 --> 25:52.730
I really need to get in there...

25:52.730 --> 25:54.060
You know what? This retreat

25:54.060 --> 25:56.870
it's really changed our lives.

25:56.870 --> 25:59.530
You know, we feel empowered,

25:59.540 --> 26:02.000
more in sync with our team,

26:02.010 --> 26:03.810
in sync with nature.

26:03.810 --> 26:07.740
And we as Libris Corp
would like to give back.

26:07.740 --> 26:09.740
Give?

26:09.750 --> 26:11.680
You know what? Maybe
I could spare you a few.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.650
Great. Come with me.

26:33.570 --> 26:35.500
Thank you, Mr. Jones.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.240
We're looking for anything
we can find on missing campers.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.510
You see, Mr. Bender,

26:45.520 --> 26:49.250
this may be the greatest
team-building exercise of all,

26:49.250 --> 26:52.190
because even during
a solo performance,

26:52.190 --> 26:54.920
the rest of the team
functions as stage
managers,

26:54.930 --> 26:56.590
as background musicians,

26:56.590 --> 26:59.590
all working together
to fulfill that
one person's vision

26:59.600 --> 27:01.200
until it's their turn.

27:02.270 --> 27:03.870
A talent show?

27:03.870 --> 27:05.270
You're pitching me
a talent show?

27:05.270 --> 27:07.140
What is more
summer camp than that?

27:07.140 --> 27:09.070
I thought
that Libris Corp was perhaps

27:09.070 --> 27:11.410
interested in investing
in this beautiful...

27:11.410 --> 27:12.740
We went to talent camp
when we were kids.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.280
- Changed our lives.
- May we?

27:16.810 --> 27:19.480
A lot of correspondence
with elected officials.

27:19.480 --> 27:20.750
Up until a few months ago,

27:20.750 --> 27:22.420
this place was
government-owned camp.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.750
A no-go area.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.760
Testimonials, success stories...

27:27.760 --> 27:29.830
ugh!

27:29.830 --> 27:31.490
Ugh, I can't find anything
on missing people.

27:31.500 --> 27:36.000
<i> Help us. Help us.</i>

27:37.500 --> 27:39.430
Stone? Stone!

27:39.440 --> 27:40.640
- Yeah.
- What's the matter?

27:40.640 --> 27:41.970
Hmm?

27:41.970 --> 27:44.040
It's like you were
gone there for a minute.

27:44.040 --> 27:48.110
Well, you see,
I keep hearing some...

27:48.110 --> 27:49.110
might be an inner ear thing.

27:49.110 --> 27:52.050
Or maybe pining over a girl?

27:52.050 --> 27:55.520
- What?
- We don't need
any distractions!

27:55.520 --> 27:57.320
We need to focus on the job.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.990
Maybe we are becoming
obsessed with the job

27:59.990 --> 28:02.790
so that we don't have to deal
with our personal lives.

28:02.790 --> 28:03.860
What are you talking about?

28:03.860 --> 28:06.730
I'm talking about
maybe we forgot

28:06.730 --> 28:08.730
that we are individuals.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.730
I'm just trying to keep
this thing together.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.330
I'm just looking
for some team commitment.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.800
It doesn't feel like
you're trying to build a team.

28:14.810 --> 28:17.070
It feels like you're...

28:17.070 --> 28:19.210
like... you're trying
to fill a void.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.450
What are you talking about?

28:29.290 --> 28:32.490
I'm talking about
the elephant that is...

28:32.490 --> 28:34.490
not in the room.

28:38.560 --> 28:41.300
I took Flynn back every time.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.630
He left again
without saying a word.

28:43.630 --> 28:45.030
That's not even
about commitment.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.440
That's about common courtesy!

28:46.440 --> 28:47.500
I'm done!

29:05.520 --> 29:07.190
Well, I guess we found
our missing campers.

29:07.190 --> 29:09.190
Oh, dear God.

29:10.930 --> 29:12.460
Oh, okay. Thank you.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.470
I've really just got
to be somewhere... else.

29:16.470 --> 29:18.400
Anywhere else, really.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.540
You guys start on the files.
I'll catch up.

29:23.540 --> 29:25.140
I got to talk to somebody.

29:27.950 --> 29:29.380
Great work today.

29:31.550 --> 29:32.510
Hi.

29:33.950 --> 29:35.280
I need to talk to you.

29:35.290 --> 29:38.950
I haven't been completely
honest with you.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.090
Is there somewhere we can
go and talk in private?

29:44.630 --> 29:45.560
Please?

29:53.240 --> 29:55.700
So what is it
you wanted to tell me?

29:55.710 --> 30:00.580
Listen, I'm sorry.

30:00.580 --> 30:03.580
You opened up to me and...

30:03.580 --> 30:05.180
you told me your secrets.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.250
I figured I scared you off.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.180
No, not the way you think.

30:09.190 --> 30:10.920
What do you mean?

30:10.920 --> 30:12.120
I'm not who you think I am.

30:12.120 --> 30:15.220
And I want to be
honest with you.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.590
If you... ow!

30:21.470 --> 30:23.460
What is that?

30:23.470 --> 30:27.200
It's just
a damn splinter,
but it's...

30:27.200 --> 30:30.140
it's crazy how much it hurts.

30:30.140 --> 30:34.010
<i> Help us. Help us.</i>

30:34.010 --> 30:37.410
- Jake? Jake?
- <i>Help us. Help us.</i>

30:37.410 --> 30:39.250
- <i>Help...</i>
- Jake, what's happening?

30:41.690 --> 30:43.690
Run!

30:43.690 --> 30:44.890
Jake!

30:44.890 --> 30:46.490
Jake! Jake!

30:54.000 --> 30:55.130
re sure this is
where he was taken?

30:55.130 --> 30:57.130
Yes, it grabbed him
right here and dragged
him away.

30:57.130 --> 31:01.000
The dirt is disturbed around
the roots, but it's hard-packed,
like they've submerged.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.070
We've looked all over this area.
There's no signs of a struggle.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.470
So where did it take him?

31:05.480 --> 31:06.880
<i>The Devil's Forest.</i>

31:06.880 --> 31:08.080
Devil's Forest?

31:08.080 --> 31:09.950
I was doing some
cross-referencing

31:09.950 --> 31:12.150
between the Clipping Book
back file

31:12.150 --> 31:13.950
and the historical deep dive,

31:13.950 --> 31:15.480
as far back as the Lewis
and Clark expedition.

31:15.490 --> 31:18.490
Seems that there have been
dozens of disappearances

31:18.490 --> 31:19.960
in what was called
the "Devil Forest,"

31:19.960 --> 31:21.620
in the words
of Meriwether Lewis.

31:21.630 --> 31:25.160
And, interestingly,
located very near
where you are now.

31:25.160 --> 31:26.430
So people have
been vanishing here

31:26.430 --> 31:28.430
- for over 100 years?
- Or more.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.830
But Bender's only been
here for six months,
so he can't be involved.

31:30.830 --> 31:32.970
Unless Bender is an immortal.

31:32.970 --> 31:34.900
And taking souls
to extend his own life.

31:34.910 --> 31:37.110
Immortals? Taking souls?

31:37.110 --> 31:39.040
It's possible.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.980
Purveyors of dark magic
have often exchanged longevity
for human sacrifices.

31:42.980 --> 31:44.510
How is this connected
to the forest?

31:44.520 --> 31:47.050
Native Americans believed
that there was a central tree,

31:47.050 --> 31:49.850
a grandfather tree, if you will,

31:49.850 --> 31:52.320
from which all other
forests derived.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.120
They believed that
if that tree fell,

31:54.130 --> 31:57.060
all the forests
of the world would die.

31:57.060 --> 31:58.260
Bender did mention something

31:58.260 --> 32:00.000
about the
inter-connectivity
of the forest.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.530
There are new theories
about fungi living
in the soil

32:01.530 --> 32:04.200
and functioning as a brain
for the entire forest.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.270
So the woods around the tree
come to life to protect it

32:06.270 --> 32:07.600
from potential dangers?

32:07.600 --> 32:09.540
And Bender's using it
to take out his enemies.

32:09.540 --> 32:12.140
There he is.
There's Bender! Bender!

32:12.140 --> 32:15.010
- Bender!
- You're not going
anywhere, Bender!

32:15.010 --> 32:16.280
What'd you do with our friend?

32:16.280 --> 32:17.750
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:17.750 --> 32:20.420
Someone I care
for a great deal was
taken by your forest.

32:20.420 --> 32:21.950
And you're gonna tell me
everything you know.

32:21.950 --> 32:24.020
Am I clear?

32:24.020 --> 32:26.420
Okay, look, in all honestly,

32:26.420 --> 32:28.020
I don't know what's
happening here either.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.220
I'm as freaked out as anybody.

32:29.230 --> 32:31.160
We found Kellog's
luggage in the lake!

32:31.160 --> 32:32.160
I was trying to cover up!

32:32.160 --> 32:33.560
What else was I supposed to do?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.300
So you just decided
to hide evidence?

32:35.300 --> 32:36.970
Let people's families
and coworkers

32:36.970 --> 32:37.970
think they just took off?

32:37.970 --> 32:39.570
Please, I know.

32:39.570 --> 32:41.840
I should have called
the authorities,
but said what?

32:41.840 --> 32:43.240
What, there's living trees?

32:43.240 --> 32:44.510
No one would've believed me.

32:44.510 --> 32:46.640
There's something evil
happening in this forest.

32:46.640 --> 32:49.640
It's something unnatural.

32:49.650 --> 32:51.110
No more games, Tannen.

32:51.110 --> 32:52.450
We want to know
everything you know now.

32:52.450 --> 32:53.920
And why would we help you?

32:53.920 --> 32:55.320
Because whatever it is out there

32:55.320 --> 32:57.550
just took one of my people.

33:03.730 --> 33:04.790
What is it?

33:04.800 --> 33:06.460
A map of the Devil's Forest.

33:06.460 --> 33:09.260
It was drawn up by the original
Lewis and Clark expedition.

33:09.270 --> 33:11.200
They reported anomalous activity

33:11.200 --> 33:13.470
to President Thomas Jefferson
in 1806.

33:13.470 --> 33:16.740
Convinced that these woods
were a repository
for dark magic,

33:16.740 --> 33:18.670
President Theodore Roosevelt
closed off access

33:18.680 --> 33:20.280
to the entire forest.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.080
And let me guess,

33:22.080 --> 33:23.550
Bender bribed some
crooked politicians

33:23.550 --> 33:25.150
to open it up
for his development.

33:25.150 --> 33:27.350
Well, according
to these documents,

33:27.350 --> 33:29.890
the Devil's Forest should
be right here on the map.

33:29.890 --> 33:32.820
But we've searched this
entire area and found nothing.

33:32.820 --> 33:36.190
That's because you're
looking in the wrong place.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.760
These maps,
they're over 200 years old.

33:41.770 --> 33:45.030
It's not a lot
of geological time,
but the Earth does age.

33:45.040 --> 33:50.570
Making corrections
for soil erosion,

33:50.570 --> 33:53.370
heat expansion
of the Earth's crust,

33:53.380 --> 33:56.150
and two centuries
of tree growth...

33:59.850 --> 34:02.750
It should be located right here.

34:04.790 --> 34:06.390
Let's roll.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.190
Come on, follow us.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.330
We know where he is.

34:32.350 --> 34:35.420
- Stone?
- Is it the origin tree?

34:36.750 --> 34:38.150
Stone?

34:40.020 --> 34:41.889
- Can you hear us?
- Is he alive?

34:41.889 --> 34:44.159
Stand back!

34:45.830 --> 34:47.900
Aah!

34:49.429 --> 34:53.699
Do it! Destroy the tree
before it kills us all!

34:53.699 --> 34:57.770
Do not... cut... down.

34:57.770 --> 35:00.040
- Cut it down!
- Listen, it's saying not to!

35:00.040 --> 35:02.040
- Is that
your friend's voice?
- No, but...

35:02.050 --> 35:04.510
It's the tree, pretending.
Ignore it!

35:04.520 --> 35:05.510
Cut it down!

35:05.520 --> 35:08.680
- Do not cut...
- Cut it down!

35:14.420 --> 35:16.430
You may have his face,

35:16.430 --> 35:17.760
but you're not Jacob Stone.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.160
We are the trees.

35:20.160 --> 35:21.430
Give him back to us.

35:21.430 --> 35:23.370
You must listen.

35:23.370 --> 35:26.230
Give him back to us
or I will cut you, I swear!

35:26.240 --> 35:28.770
Baird, watch out!

35:28.770 --> 35:29.770
Oh!

35:31.840 --> 35:33.440
Eve Baird.

35:37.250 --> 35:40.050
Eve... Baird.

35:45.720 --> 35:46.790
Eve.

35:46.790 --> 35:47.990
Stone?

35:47.990 --> 35:53.130
It is me. I am with them.

35:53.130 --> 35:54.730
I'm part of the forest.

35:54.730 --> 35:57.730
If you really are Jacob Stone,

35:57.730 --> 35:59.470
say something only
he would know.

35:59.470 --> 36:02.070
It is not your fault.

36:02.070 --> 36:03.470
What?

36:03.470 --> 36:08.010
It is not your fault
that he left...

36:08.010 --> 36:09.940
that Flynn left.

36:09.950 --> 36:13.350
You've done nothing wrong.

36:13.350 --> 36:17.550
You've got nothing
to prove to us.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.760
Stone.

36:20.760 --> 36:23.360
We are a team.

36:23.360 --> 36:25.660
We will always be.

36:32.300 --> 36:35.640
The trees needed a voice,

36:35.640 --> 36:38.240
so they reached out
for ambassadors.

36:38.240 --> 36:41.180
The language of the trees

36:41.180 --> 36:43.580
and of the humans

36:43.580 --> 36:47.520
are very, very far apart.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.250
Until they found you,

36:50.250 --> 36:53.190
a linguist who
speaks 64 dialects.

36:53.190 --> 36:55.520
The splinter in your hand.

36:55.530 --> 36:59.130
First contact.

36:59.130 --> 37:04.600
They've been looking
for someone like me
for over 100 years.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.540
If this forest dies,

37:06.540 --> 37:10.000
all forests die,

37:10.010 --> 37:12.010
all life dies with it.

37:12.010 --> 37:13.610
They're asking for help.

37:13.610 --> 37:15.140
What do you want us to do?

37:23.420 --> 37:26.760
This is the Zero Seed.

37:26.760 --> 37:28.360
Keep it safe.

37:28.360 --> 37:32.030
If this forest
is ever destroyed,

37:32.030 --> 37:36.330
it can be...

37:36.330 --> 37:38.970
reconstituted with this seed.

37:38.970 --> 37:40.370
We will protect it.

37:40.370 --> 37:42.370
Nowhere in the world
would it be safer.

37:42.370 --> 37:45.910
And you must promise
to protect this forest

37:45.910 --> 37:48.510
and... this tree.

37:48.510 --> 37:51.580
When I report back
to General Rockwell,

37:51.580 --> 37:55.450
you can count on Area 51
status in perpetuity.

38:28.350 --> 38:31.290
So what are you
gonna do with the camp?

38:31.290 --> 38:33.090
I've signed it over to DOSA.

38:33.090 --> 38:34.960
We'll make sure this is
all federally protected.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.030
This time beyond
the reach of politics.

38:37.030 --> 38:38.890
I am sorry.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.230
- About everything.
- Don't be.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.630
We came here
to become a team again,

38:42.630 --> 38:45.970
and that's what happened.
Thank you.

38:53.110 --> 38:54.110
All right, man.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.720
Before you were taken
by the forest,

39:01.720 --> 39:02.850
you were about
to tell me something.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.650
I'd rather show you.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.340
It's beautiful.

39:22.470 --> 39:26.010
This is The Library.

39:29.350 --> 39:30.480
The Library is real!

39:30.480 --> 39:32.350
I knew it!

39:32.350 --> 39:33.620
Oh!

39:33.620 --> 39:35.350
They thought I was insane,

39:35.350 --> 39:36.550
but look!

39:36.550 --> 39:37.690
Oh!

39:37.690 --> 39:39.550
This place is incredible!

39:41.960 --> 39:44.030
Better than I could've imagined.

39:47.430 --> 39:48.600
Wait.

39:54.710 --> 39:57.040
If this is The Library,
then you...

39:57.040 --> 39:58.170
I'm a Librarian.

39:58.180 --> 40:01.310
Oh, my God.

40:03.250 --> 40:04.980
I can't believe it.

40:04.980 --> 40:06.780
Yeah.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.580
And Cassandra and Ezekiel.

40:08.590 --> 40:09.580
And Baird?

40:09.590 --> 40:12.190
Baird is a Guardian.

40:12.190 --> 40:13.390
She protects us.

40:13.390 --> 40:15.160
She protects this place.

40:17.660 --> 40:20.400
Oh.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.000
I cannot wait
for them to find out
at my old newspaper.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.670
They thought I was crazy,

40:24.670 --> 40:28.270
but they are so gonna
eat their words!

40:28.270 --> 40:32.070
Sarina, you can't write
about this place.

40:33.810 --> 40:35.680
You can't tell a soul.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.480
This has to be our secret.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.350
What? Why?

40:39.350 --> 40:41.820
The Library works
in the shadows.

40:41.820 --> 40:44.490
The light of day
would destroy us.

40:44.490 --> 40:47.890
Why tell me?

40:47.890 --> 40:51.230
Why show me all of this?

40:51.230 --> 40:54.660
'Cause I wanted you
to know you're not crazy.

40:56.170 --> 40:59.700
And I wanted you to know
that this is why
I can't be with you.

41:00.970 --> 41:02.500
Because you're a Librarian.

41:02.510 --> 41:04.770
My destiny's here.

41:10.650 --> 41:12.250
Will I ever see you again?

41:22.260 --> 41:24.730
We'll always have The Library.
