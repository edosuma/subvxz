00:13.141 --> 00:16.580
Tonight, I talk to two old ladies.

00:16.580 --> 00:20.021
Richard makes a phone call.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.780
And James sniffs his own armpit.

00:31.819 --> 00:34.060
Good evening, hello.

00:34.060 --> 00:36.700
Hello, everybody.
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.099
Now...

00:39.259 --> 00:42.220
we start tonight with the big one,

00:42.220 --> 00:47.099
the all-new, all-British
McLaren MP4-12C.

00:47.099 --> 00:48.779
And there are two questions.

00:48.779 --> 00:52.419
One, why have they named it
after a fax machine?

00:52.419 --> 00:58.979
And two, how can it possibly
be as good as a Ferrari 458?

01:03.339 --> 01:08.458
'McLaren themselves admit
that the 458 is a great car.

01:10.657 --> 01:14.778
'But they say that,
scientifically and mathematically,

01:14.778 --> 01:18.257
'they can prove that,
in every single measurable way,

01:18.257 --> 01:20.418
'their new car is better.

01:55.375 --> 01:59.056
'Well, certainly at £168,000
it is a tiny bit...'

02:00.415 --> 02:04.375
I was going to say cheaper,
let's say less expensive
than the Ferrari.

02:05.735 --> 02:08.574
'It's also a tiny bit kinder
to the environment,'

02:08.574 --> 02:12.414
a tiny bit lighter,
a tiny bit more economical.

02:13.535 --> 02:16.734
'It's also quite a lot
more powerful.'

02:25.414 --> 02:31.574
The Ferrari has to make do
with just 562 horsepower,

02:31.574 --> 02:39.053
whereas the twin turbocharged
3.8 litre V8 in this
churns out 592.

02:50.772 --> 02:52.053
'The result is simple.

02:53.133 --> 03:00.293
'0-60 takes 3.1 seconds.
The top speed is 205.

03:00.293 --> 03:03.772
'And though it's close...

03:03.772 --> 03:06.531
'the Ferrari cannot live with that.

03:06.531 --> 03:10.212
'And it's a similar story
when the going gets twisty.'

03:28.050 --> 03:32.331
'I love that Ferrari, and it is
as quick round here...'

03:33.410 --> 03:36.370
as an Enzo.

03:36.370 --> 03:38.211
But I think this is quicker still.

03:39.330 --> 03:42.970
Ferrari has been in the Formula One
game longer than anybody,

03:42.970 --> 03:47.650
but McLaren, amazingly,
has a higher hit rate.

03:47.650 --> 03:51.689
'They've won one in every four
Grands Prix they've ever entered.

03:51.689 --> 03:56.009
'Which shows they certainly
know how to make a car
go round a corner.'

03:59.009 --> 04:01.849
My God, they've
worked their magic with this.

04:05.849 --> 04:09.609
Can you see the Ferrari waggling
its tail there? This isn't.

04:09.609 --> 04:16.048
This grips onto the road
like a terrified toddler
grips on to its mother's hand.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.928
So, Lewis Hamilton, watch and learn.

04:18.928 --> 04:21.848
'This is how you pass a Ferrari...'

04:24.928 --> 04:27.608
without crashing into it.
Oh, yes!

04:38.527 --> 04:43.647
'One of the reasons
the McLaren is so fast
is its traction control system.

04:44.847 --> 04:48.607
'A system that really
comes into its own in the rain.

04:55.887 --> 05:00.086
'It lets you drive hard,
but it won't let you kill yourself.

05:00.086 --> 05:04.846
'And that is just the tip
of a technological iceberg.

05:08.525 --> 05:12.606
'There's a flap on the back
which raises when you brake hard,

05:12.606 --> 05:16.565
'so you can't see what's about
to crash into the back of you.

05:18.445 --> 05:20.805
'And then we get to the suspension.

05:20.805 --> 05:24.084
'A computer has replaced
the anti-roll bars,

05:24.084 --> 05:27.725
'so all four wheels are truly
independent of one other.

05:27.725 --> 05:32.524
'This gives you better cornering
and, more importantly,
a better ride.'

05:34.844 --> 05:39.084
Over the years, we've seen
the Stig cutting this corner,

05:39.084 --> 05:43.484
putting two wheels on the grass
to get the best possible lap times.

05:48.443 --> 05:52.003
But if you ride a bump like that

05:52.003 --> 05:55.523
in the sort of hunkered-down,
firmed-up cars
that he drives...

05:58.843 --> 06:00.443
the jolt is horrific.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.802
It's like being dipped
in liquid nitrogen and
then hit with a hammer.

06:03.802 --> 06:05.443
You just sort of shatter.

06:06.923 --> 06:10.282
'In the McLaren, though,
it's a very different experience.'

06:10.282 --> 06:13.283
There we go,
two wheels off the track.

06:16.322 --> 06:20.922
You'd get more of a jolt
if you drove a Rolls-Royce
over a Jaffa cake.

06:24.162 --> 06:27.081
'I've never driven a supercar
that's even half

06:27.081 --> 06:28.642
'as comfortable as this.

06:29.921 --> 06:32.161
'Or as well-trimmed.

06:32.161 --> 06:36.881
'It's all exquisite leather and
stitching and beautiful graphics.

06:36.881 --> 06:42.320
'It's a simple, elegant,
a truly lovely place to sit.'

06:42.320 --> 06:46.161
So, yes, in every scientific
and mathematical way,

06:46.161 --> 06:49.560
this is better than a Ferrari 458.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.800
It'll even do 30 miles
to the gallon.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.120
But there's something missing,
something that can't be measured,

06:56.120 --> 06:59.200
something you can't really
put your finger on.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.439
There's no... zing.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.479
'This is the factory
where the McLaren is made.

07:11.479 --> 07:15.399
'It's like a laboratory.
It's quiet, ordered,

07:15.399 --> 07:18.719
'a magnesium and titanium
Trappist world

07:18.719 --> 07:21.678
'where perfection
isn't quite good enough.

07:21.678 --> 07:23.319
'It's very nice.

07:23.319 --> 07:26.798
'But you can't imagine anyone
here has ever put a whoopee cushion

07:26.798 --> 07:29.198
'on the managing director's chair.

07:32.838 --> 07:36.677
'You sense this lack of joy
when you're behind the wheel.

07:36.677 --> 07:39.318
'When you drive a Lamborghini,'

07:39.318 --> 07:43.557
it's like you're operating
a horse with some mustard
stuck up its bottom,

07:43.557 --> 07:47.517
'but when you drive this,
it's like you're operating'

07:47.517 --> 07:52.756
the sort of machine they use,
I imagine, in ophthalmic surgery.

07:52.756 --> 07:57.357
'We see the same problem
with the way the McLaren looks.

07:59.436 --> 08:02.837
'There's nothing wrong with it,
but there's no art.

08:02.837 --> 08:07.596
'You get the sense it was styled
by software and shaped by science.

08:07.596 --> 08:09.876
'Which it probably was.'

08:10.956 --> 08:12.716
I'll give you another example.

08:12.716 --> 08:14.995
You can turn
the traction control off,

08:14.995 --> 08:18.996
but it'd be easier to launch the
missiles from a nuclear submarine.

08:18.996 --> 08:23.395
You have to push that button and
hold it down for 10 seconds,

08:23.395 --> 08:25.516
then you push those two
simultaneously,

08:25.516 --> 08:29.035
and I said to one of the engineers,
"Why does it have to be
so complicated?"

08:29.035 --> 08:32.075
He said, "Why would you want to turn
the traction control off?"

08:32.075 --> 08:33.554
I said, "Well, it'd be fun."

08:33.554 --> 08:36.715
And you could see him thinking,
"Hmm, fun?

08:36.715 --> 08:39.794
"I must look that up
in a dictionary."

08:42.714 --> 08:45.194
'The McLaren, then,
is like a pair of tights.

08:45.194 --> 08:48.794
'Very practical and very sensible.

08:51.194 --> 08:55.914
'The Ferrari, though,
that is a pair of stockings.'

09:18.193 --> 09:20.193
What are you on about?

09:20.193 --> 09:25.512
Well, tights and stockings are
designed to do exactly the same job.

09:25.512 --> 09:27.912
But they don't.

09:27.912 --> 09:30.792
I don't know,
I only wear socks, Jeremy.

09:30.792 --> 09:34.352
Can we just move on from the hosiery,
chaps, back to the car?

09:34.352 --> 09:36.432
Is the ride really that good?

09:36.432 --> 09:38.911
Like a Rolls-Royce.
Unbelievably smooth.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.992
And do you know why?
Wasn't developed at the Nurburgring.

09:41.992 --> 09:43.991
Oh, God, he's off again.

09:43.991 --> 09:46.351
True fact, it was developed,
actually,

09:46.351 --> 09:48.351
at the Top Gear test track,
this car was,

09:48.351 --> 09:52.151
so it should be able to set
a blisteringly fast lap time.

09:52.151 --> 09:55.070
Of course, to find out we have to
give it to our racing driver.

09:55.070 --> 09:58.671
Some say that he refuses
to acknowledge

09:58.671 --> 10:00.870
the existence of Nottinghamshire.

10:02.390 --> 10:05.430
And that he recently received
a very strong e-mail

10:05.430 --> 10:07.070
from his fiancee's mother

10:07.070 --> 10:11.109
saying it's bad manners to sit
at the dinner table in a helmet.

10:12.630 --> 10:15.430
All we know is
he's called the Stig!

10:16.749 --> 10:18.269
'And it's off.

10:18.269 --> 10:21.230
'MP4-12C may sound
like a fax machine,

10:21.230 --> 10:25.029
'but this car is fast,
no doubt about that.

10:25.029 --> 10:28.269
'Double clutch gearbox
shifting seamlessly,

10:28.269 --> 10:30.469
'going through the first corner,

10:30.469 --> 10:32.109
'no dramas whatsoever.'

10:35.829 --> 10:39.188
'Stig listening to ABBA
in Spanish, very weird.

10:39.188 --> 10:43.429
'Almost as weird as the way it takes
Chicago, strangely calm, that.

10:43.429 --> 10:46.268
'Squirrelly under-braking
into Hammerhead.

10:46.268 --> 10:50.748
'Now the meat of the corner,
and it's regained its composure
completely.

10:50.748 --> 10:54.428
'McLaren have actually been fiddling
with the car since I drove it,

10:54.428 --> 10:57.147
'so the ones you buy
will have a sharper throttle.

10:58.668 --> 11:00.387
'And more noise.

11:00.387 --> 11:04.267
'OK, follow-through,
a chance to really open up
the twin-turbo V8.

11:04.267 --> 11:06.747
'How much is he going to
clip the corner?

11:06.747 --> 11:09.507
'A lot,
but he won't have felt a thing.

11:09.507 --> 11:12.626
'Just two corners to go now,
air brake helping out there,

11:12.626 --> 11:16.227
'tyres squealing,
only Gambon left.

11:16.227 --> 11:20.346
'Millimetrically perfect,
and there he is, across the line!'

11:23.306 --> 11:25.146
Now...

11:25.146 --> 11:26.946
OK.

11:29.666 --> 11:34.865
Here is the Ferrari 458, 1.19.1.
The Ferrari Enzo 1.90.

11:34.865 --> 11:39.305
The MP4-12C, 1.16.2.

11:39.305 --> 11:45.225
It is the second fastest car
we've ever had here!

11:46.385 --> 11:48.905
Wow! That's amazing.

11:48.905 --> 11:53.505
Right, now, we must move on
because it is time for the news,

11:53.505 --> 11:55.904
and we start with news
of an event coming up,

11:55.904 --> 11:58.624
the Cholmondeley Pageant of Power.

11:58.624 --> 12:01.464
The what?
Cholmondeley Pageant of Power.

12:01.464 --> 12:04.344
Excellent. We're the world's
biggest motoring show,

12:04.344 --> 12:06.983
and we begin the news
with an item about a village fete.

12:06.983 --> 12:11.384
No, it's like a northern
Goodwood Festival of Speed.

12:11.384 --> 12:14.063
So a Goodwood with pies
and gravy? No!

12:14.063 --> 12:17.543
Anyway, the point is
there's going to be a car
at it I wanted to show you.

12:17.543 --> 12:21.463
It's this, it's called the Brutus.

12:21.463 --> 12:23.823
Yeah, it's magnificent.

12:23.823 --> 12:27.543
Basically it's a 1908 BMW chassis,
made in the 1920s

12:27.543 --> 12:31.263
and it's got a 46 litre
12 cylinder aeroplane...

12:31.263 --> 12:35.342
46 litre?! 46 litre 12 cylinders.
Here's the actual engine out of it.

12:35.342 --> 12:37.182
Look at that! Holy cow!

12:37.182 --> 12:40.902
It's like a Turner painting,
all this steam, speed and fire.

12:40.902 --> 12:44.782
It's magnificent. I'm going
to send that to Greenpeace
to hang up in their foyer.

12:44.782 --> 12:49.262
They'd love it, actually,
because it does 0.18 miles
to the gallon.

12:49.262 --> 12:51.181
You're kidding?

12:51.181 --> 12:54.462
I love the engine,
but what fascinates me
about old cars like this

12:54.462 --> 12:59.021
is why people feel compelled
to get into period costume
before driving them.

12:59.021 --> 13:01.421
I mean, you live in a 1970s house.

13:01.421 --> 13:04.821
Do you feel the need to wear a shirt
from the 19... Yes, you do.

13:06.101 --> 13:07.940
He does, actually, yes.

13:07.940 --> 13:10.701
Anyway, we have more news.

13:10.701 --> 13:13.940
A few weeks ago
I held a small birthday party
for the E-Type Jaguar.

13:13.940 --> 13:15.500
Yes, I recall, it was subtle.

13:15.500 --> 13:20.420
Somebody else is having one
at Silverstone on
the weekend of 22nd July,

13:20.420 --> 13:22.740
and they say 1,000
E-Types will be there.

13:22.740 --> 13:27.900
I think what they mean is 1,000
E-Types will attempt to be there.

13:27.900 --> 13:33.340
On that particular day,
1,000 E-Types will try and start.
Yeah, some E-Types will be there.

13:33.340 --> 13:36.179
Why will they be there?
I've never understood that.

13:36.179 --> 13:38.979
You drive hundreds of miles
in your car to look at some cars

13:38.979 --> 13:42.339
that are exactly the same
as the car that you
just drove there in?

13:42.339 --> 13:44.939
Well, is there anyone here
from a car owners' club?

13:46.098 --> 13:47.658
You are?

13:47.658 --> 13:53.938
And this is which club? Marlin.
The what? Marlin. That's a fish.

13:53.938 --> 13:58.018
That's a very lonely owners' club.

13:58.018 --> 14:01.458
He goes and stands in a field
all by himself.

14:01.458 --> 14:04.818
Is there anybody here
from a car club that's got
more than one member?

14:04.818 --> 14:05.978
What?

14:05.978 --> 14:07.138
Renault Clio.

14:07.138 --> 14:10.377
Renault Clio owners' club?!
How can there be a club for that?

14:10.377 --> 14:13.697
Do you go and meet
and stand in fields? Car-parks.

14:13.697 --> 14:15.057
Car parks?

14:15.057 --> 14:17.057
Oh, I want to join!

14:17.057 --> 14:19.056
"I've got a Renault Clio."
"So have I!"

14:19.056 --> 14:21.177
Any other car makers here?

14:21.177 --> 14:24.936
Anyone from the MG owners' club?
Not here, obviously.

14:24.936 --> 14:28.657
That's a good point,
they won't be here, they'll be
on the A3 going, "Oh, no!"

14:28.657 --> 14:33.296
I wonder sometimes,
do people who are MG enthusiasts

14:33.296 --> 14:36.816
buy them hoping they break down?

14:36.816 --> 14:41.375
They do. They do.
"That way I can get underneath it
and get my fingernails all dirty!"

14:41.375 --> 14:45.256
No, cos if all they wanted
to do was drive around
in an open-topped two-seater

14:45.256 --> 14:48.655
they'd buy a Mazda MX-5,
cos that'll always work.
I think they're mad.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.736
It's like being an amateur vet
and saying,

14:50.736 --> 14:53.175
"I'm going to deliberately
buy a dog that's poorly

14:53.175 --> 14:56.335
"in the hope it goes wrong
and I can fix it."

14:57.574 --> 15:01.095
Now, there is a new BMW M5, we can
tell you several things about it.

15:01.095 --> 15:03.414
First of all, it'll cost £73,000.

15:03.414 --> 15:05.735
Secondly, it's based on
the current 5-Series,

15:05.735 --> 15:08.774
one of the best-looking cars around.
That looks even better.

15:08.774 --> 15:13.134
Thirdly, the engine, for the first
time, is turbo-charged
because of some air problem,

15:13.134 --> 15:15.534
carbon dioxide,
it has to be cleaner,

15:15.534 --> 15:19.613
and it'll also, even though
I haven't driven it,
be fantastic to drive.

15:19.613 --> 15:20.973
I know that. It will.

15:20.973 --> 15:24.174
All M5s have always been fantastic,
there's never been a bad one.

15:24.174 --> 15:27.973
No, there hasn't. There's a lot
on this as well, a lot of equipment.

15:27.973 --> 15:30.014
It's got a rear-view camera,

15:30.014 --> 15:34.173
it's also got a multimedia system
that can bring up Facebook
and Twitter.

15:34.173 --> 15:36.252
I don't want one anymore.

15:36.252 --> 15:38.573
Why would you want that
on your dashboard?

15:38.573 --> 15:42.012
Driving up the A1, "Oh, look,
Lilly Allen's having sardines."

15:42.012 --> 15:44.693
It's not relevant.
Is that necessary?

15:44.693 --> 15:47.572
Do fighter pilots have Twitter
on their dash? Yes.

15:47.572 --> 15:52.492
"I'm locked on to target. Oh,
hang on. Stephen Fry's just said
something brainy about a play."

15:52.492 --> 15:54.052
You don't need...

15:54.052 --> 15:57.532
I really do think we get
too much information
when we're driving now.

15:57.532 --> 16:01.452
Those signs that say
'spray possible', which,
on a nice day in June, it isn't.

16:01.452 --> 16:05.691
And you know those posters,
they used to be adverts that said,

16:05.691 --> 16:09.931
"Drink food and eat beer,"
or whatever it is on them,
"Use toothpaste".

16:09.931 --> 16:12.571
Now they've made them electronic,
and Sky News has one

16:12.571 --> 16:15.291
and it gives you snippets
of news as you drive by.

16:15.291 --> 16:18.971
I drove past one the other day,
it'd be OK if it was short,
but it's quite long,

16:18.971 --> 16:24.331
so you're going,
"JK Rowling sacks agent after..."
Not looking where you're going.

16:24.331 --> 16:27.650
I drove down the A40 just after you
and the headline was quite brief.

16:27.650 --> 16:31.051
It said,
"Clarkson has massive accident."

16:31.051 --> 16:34.570
Now, can I just say, as we know,

16:34.570 --> 16:37.089
birds sometimes defecate
on your car.

16:37.089 --> 16:40.770
At this time of year
that's bad for the paintwork
cos the lacquer is soft.

16:40.770 --> 16:44.169
What? Where are you going
with this, mate?

16:44.169 --> 16:48.529
Where I'm going is this.
A bird defecated on my car
this week. That's terrible.

16:48.529 --> 16:51.889
That's not that unusual.
It'll have happened to people here.

16:51.889 --> 16:54.129
Not like this.

16:54.129 --> 16:58.249
OK, I've brought an iPad here,
I know how they work, of course.

16:58.249 --> 17:01.448
Here is the bird. Yes, it's some
bird poo on your back window.

17:01.448 --> 17:04.167
That's a significant quantity
of bird poo.

17:04.167 --> 17:07.008
You'd say that's a big bird
that did that. Look at this.

17:10.568 --> 17:13.488
It gets to there and you think,
"That must be the end."

17:14.968 --> 17:17.488
That is a metre of faeces!

17:18.488 --> 17:20.528
What bird can do a metre
of faec...?!

17:20.528 --> 17:26.287
I'm two metres tall
and I can't do a metre of faeces!

17:26.287 --> 17:30.047
You live in Oxfordshire,
you've got those red kites
there, they're big birds.

17:30.047 --> 17:32.366
They are big birds,
and they are carnivores.

17:32.366 --> 17:36.047
Now, I examined this faeces,
and there were seven
cherry stones in it.

17:37.606 --> 17:41.567
Well, maybe it had a field mouse
in a cherry jus in Oxfordshire?
It didn't!

17:41.567 --> 17:45.206
If the cherry stones
were in its gut, it must have
eaten the cherry whole,

17:45.206 --> 17:49.126
which means it must've had
a mouth like a Peugeot!

17:49.126 --> 17:53.606
What kind of bird can have a gallon
of guano in its gut

17:53.606 --> 17:59.206
and still take off and achieve
sufficient altitude to defecate
on my Range Rover?!

17:59.206 --> 18:03.766
A big one!
Maybe it was a flying cow. What?

18:03.766 --> 18:06.765
James, you really do live
in Hammersmith, don't you?

18:06.765 --> 18:10.924
We should bear in mind this is
the man who believes cows lay eggs,

18:10.924 --> 18:14.125
and he does. He said that
on the show. You say that...

18:14.125 --> 18:16.604
I said eggs come from cows.
Well, you see...

18:18.204 --> 18:21.085
Can I just say, I want to have
a competition on this.

18:21.085 --> 18:24.924
If anybody can find a bigger
piece of bird dirt than that

18:24.924 --> 18:29.524
on their car, take a photograph
and send it to us at Top Gear,

18:29.524 --> 18:31.964
London, where are we? W12 7TS.

18:31.964 --> 18:36.204
Mark your envelope, "You really
are plumbing new depths this week."

18:36.204 --> 18:37.764
Well, you are!

18:37.764 --> 18:40.643
Now, there is a new Range Rover.

18:40.643 --> 18:43.324
It's not as big as the real thing,
but does it work?

18:43.324 --> 18:47.843
To find out, I went to the
United States. Which is in America.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.642
'This is it.

19:05.642 --> 19:08.322
'It's called the Evoque,

19:08.322 --> 19:10.882
'and even though it's covered
in Range Rover badges,

19:10.882 --> 19:14.122
'it doesn't look especially tough
or off-road-y.

19:14.122 --> 19:19.321
'Little wonder, when the design
consultant for this car
was Victoria Beckham.'

19:20.761 --> 19:24.041
This is one of those luxury
lifestyle off-roaders,

19:24.041 --> 19:28.040
which is why the producers
have told me to drive it
to Las Vegas,

19:28.040 --> 19:32.841
where I have a job for the evening
chauffeuring the cosmetically
enhanced Cher.

19:32.841 --> 19:36.961
However, there is a small
obstacle in the way.

19:38.121 --> 19:40.160
'Actually, it's quite a big
obstacle,

19:40.160 --> 19:43.200
'because my starting point
is here.'

19:47.080 --> 19:52.520
'Death Valley, one of the most
inhospitable places on earth,

19:52.520 --> 19:56.679
'boasting some of the toughest
terrain a car could ever face.'

20:00.040 --> 20:05.319
So, it's the perfect place
to decide if the new Evoque
is a proper Range Rover

20:05.319 --> 20:08.399
or just a big
designer girl's blouse.

20:15.559 --> 20:19.278
'The edge of Death Valley
was 150 miles away,

20:19.278 --> 20:23.278
'and to get there I wasn't
allowed to use any tarmaced roads.'

20:24.278 --> 20:29.717
Now, this is no small challenge
because the Evoque doesn't have
a massive separate chassis,

20:29.717 --> 20:34.597
it doesn't have a low range gearbox,
and it doesn't have a big
fire-breathing V8.

20:35.717 --> 20:39.317
What it has is a four cylinder
turbo diesel engine

20:39.317 --> 20:41.157
making 187 horsepower,

20:41.157 --> 20:44.796
and underneath it's based on
the old Freelander,

20:44.796 --> 20:47.917
which is loosely related
to the Ford Mondeo.

20:51.956 --> 20:57.236
I think the record temperature
for this area is something like 137.

20:58.396 --> 21:00.396
If the car were to
break down out here,

21:00.396 --> 21:04.916
I reckon it would be three,
maybe four minutes

21:04.916 --> 21:10.196
before I got into the crew's Range
Rover and went back to the hotel.

21:12.276 --> 21:14.515
'For the first few miles,

21:14.515 --> 21:17.436
'the terrain didn't offer
much of a challenge.

21:17.436 --> 21:21.195
'But I did find out something
pleasing about the Evoque.'

21:21.195 --> 21:23.554
The ride in this car is excellent.

21:23.554 --> 21:27.275
This surface is actually
quite washboard...

21:28.475 --> 21:31.874
but this is soaking it up
marvellously.

21:31.874 --> 21:35.114
'That's because the dampers
are filled with a fluid

21:35.114 --> 21:37.674
'that contains magnetised
iron filings,

21:37.674 --> 21:41.434
'which can react in milliseconds
to alter the firmness
of the suspension.'

21:42.434 --> 21:45.833
It's the same system, actually,
that they use on the Audi R8,

21:45.833 --> 21:48.834
only in this they can respond
twice as quickly.

21:50.434 --> 21:53.473
And if that was you
responsible for that, Mrs Beckham,

21:53.473 --> 21:55.714
then can I say
thank you very much indeed?

21:57.633 --> 21:59.233
'Mrs Beckham's suspension

21:59.233 --> 22:02.072
'wafted me towards my appointment
in Las Vegas.'

22:10.152 --> 22:12.073
Stereo's good as well.

22:12.073 --> 22:15.192
The interior is very good,
nicely trimmed and everything,

22:15.192 --> 22:19.032
but then it should be because
this may be a baby Range Rover,

22:19.032 --> 22:22.352
but even the most basic one
starts at £28,000,

22:22.352 --> 22:28.312
and if you have the Prestige model,
like I have here,
then it's about £43,000.

22:33.791 --> 22:37.911
'Soon, the going started
to get much tougher.'

22:37.911 --> 22:39.951
Ow.

22:39.951 --> 22:43.951
'This is where you normally need
a low-range gearbox,

22:43.951 --> 22:50.031
'but instead the Evoque has
an electronic off-road system
called terrain response.'

22:50.031 --> 22:51.511
Difficult terrain setting.

22:51.511 --> 22:54.350
'Now I'd find out
if it was any good.'

22:58.070 --> 23:02.190
Find me some traction. There you go.

23:02.190 --> 23:07.430
'Along with the terrain response,
there are other 21st century aids'.

23:07.430 --> 23:11.469
I can use, look, these cameras,
there's five cameras on the car

23:11.469 --> 23:14.989
which help me to look out for bits
that I might otherwise hit.

23:14.989 --> 23:19.588
Going on this one,
I could miss that rock.

23:20.749 --> 23:23.309
Loving your work, Mrs Beckham.

23:25.788 --> 23:28.869
'Soon, I found myself in a narrow,
rocky canyon,

23:28.869 --> 23:32.108
'and the Evoque
started to struggle.'

23:33.908 --> 23:36.188
Make an aim for that bit.

23:45.628 --> 23:47.067
Yes!

23:47.067 --> 23:48.867
Give me more of that!

23:50.027 --> 23:52.507
I have to say,
this is pretty good for a car that,

23:52.507 --> 23:56.307
let's be honest, most people
are going to drive to the shops

23:56.307 --> 23:59.947
and occasionally across a field
to a Pony Club meeting

23:59.947 --> 24:02.787
or Gymkhana,
or whatever they're called.

24:04.306 --> 24:08.107
'But eventually the Evoque
had to throw in the towel.'

24:08.107 --> 24:09.186
Oh, no.

24:13.106 --> 24:17.706
I must be a bit of a chump thinking
I can get up that, must I not?

24:17.706 --> 24:20.545
That is officially a small cliff.

24:20.545 --> 24:22.826
Still, it's quite a noble effort.

24:22.826 --> 24:25.625
I think we'll have to find
a different way round.

24:31.465 --> 24:35.025
'Having retraced my steps,
I found another route

24:35.025 --> 24:36.784
'and was soon flying along.'

24:37.785 --> 24:39.985
Woo! This is better!

24:39.985 --> 24:42.104
'Look at the speed I'm doing,'

24:42.104 --> 24:45.384
I'm doing 70 miles an hour
on my way to Cher.

24:46.785 --> 24:48.864
'But then...'

24:48.864 --> 24:52.384
Oh, no! Oh!

24:59.183 --> 25:03.064
'With the sand dunes sitting
slap-bang between me and Cher,

25:03.064 --> 25:07.543
'there was no option but
to put my faith once more
in the terrain response computer.

25:09.703 --> 25:11.463
'I have it in sand mode,'

25:11.463 --> 25:14.263
and what it does is it changes
all sorts of things,

25:14.263 --> 25:16.983
the suspension settings,
the throttle response,

25:16.983 --> 25:20.423
and because I've got it in sand,
I get very peaky power delivery,

25:20.423 --> 25:25.303
it holds it in the lower gears,
I can change manually in it,
it keeps me going through the sand.

25:33.222 --> 25:35.222
That's steeper than I thought.

25:36.662 --> 25:41.502
'As it turned out,
the baby Range Rover
coped well on the sand.'

25:44.861 --> 25:47.181
What happens if I try
and go up there?

25:47.181 --> 25:50.221
Crikey, that's a big climb.
You've got to be bloody careful.

25:50.221 --> 25:53.061
'There was, however, a weak link,

25:53.061 --> 25:56.461
'and, as ever,
it was my internal sat nav.'

25:56.461 --> 26:00.660
Hang on, hang on.
Now I'm going the wrong way.

26:00.660 --> 26:03.421
No. No, no, no.

26:03.421 --> 26:06.380
It just looks like a sheet
of beige paper.

26:06.380 --> 26:10.379
'And then some enthusiastic
locals turned up.'

26:25.899 --> 26:27.059
Yobbos!

26:30.899 --> 26:32.219
Come on, then.

26:36.499 --> 26:39.858
I don't know what the hell
the engines are they've got
in those things,

26:39.858 --> 26:41.659
but they're massive!

26:42.899 --> 26:45.178
They've done a wheelie!

26:46.658 --> 26:50.098
'After they'd stripped the Evoque
of most of its paint...'

26:52.698 --> 26:54.457
Thank you.

26:54.457 --> 26:58.138
'the Death Valley rednecks showed
me the way out of the dunes.'

27:00.217 --> 27:03.897
I've no idea who these blokes are,
but they're good sports.

27:07.137 --> 27:11.856
'Eventually, the buggy chaps
deposited me on a dry riverbed,

27:11.856 --> 27:14.577
'but since I was now running
late for my date with Cher,

27:14.577 --> 27:18.056
'there was no time to give
the Evoque a breather.'

27:24.416 --> 27:27.256
Well, this is about as fast
as it will go, actually,

27:27.256 --> 27:28.736
cos it's slightly soft.

27:30.736 --> 27:35.896
I can get up to about 75 or so
before the car starts
squirreling around.

27:37.016 --> 27:41.095
Again, Mrs Beckham, I have to
commend you on your car.

27:48.495 --> 27:52.055
'As the sun set,
I came upon a marvellous sight.'

27:52.055 --> 27:53.135
He-hey!

27:54.615 --> 27:56.974
Oh, that's nice.

27:56.974 --> 28:00.215
Mmm, lovely, lovely tarmac.

28:01.214 --> 28:07.094
It's like a cool hand passed
across your fevered brow, tarmac.

28:08.894 --> 28:11.014
'It also meant
I was out of Death Valley

28:11.014 --> 28:13.733
'and on course to make
my appointment.'

28:13.733 --> 28:17.413
'Right, I'm pretty sure
that Cher is not
going to be interested'

28:17.413 --> 28:20.213
in the road test of the Evoque,
so here's a quick sum-up.

28:20.213 --> 28:22.014
'Things I like.'

28:22.014 --> 28:26.013
I think it looks excellent,
it's particularly good off-road,
as it turns out.

28:26.013 --> 28:29.693
It has a nice, tasteful interior,
and the ride is excellent.

28:29.693 --> 28:33.533
Things I don't like,
it's not that spacious in the back,

28:33.533 --> 28:35.972
there are a few too many
buttons on the steering wheel,

28:35.972 --> 28:37.973
and the door mirrors are too big.

28:39.812 --> 28:42.412
Anyway, onwards to Cher.

28:47.412 --> 28:51.051
'Eventually, my destination
came into view.

28:51.051 --> 28:53.612
'Not that you could miss it.'

29:01.731 --> 29:04.731
I've heard Cher's a bit of a diva,
actually.

29:04.731 --> 29:06.890
I don't know how
she's going to take to...

29:08.771 --> 29:11.371
a man who's done this much
desert off-roading.

29:11.371 --> 29:14.850
Hopefully she likes
a bit of stinky rough.

29:14.850 --> 29:17.970
'Soon, I arrived at the venue.'

29:25.170 --> 29:28.170
Temperature set to something
comfortable.

29:28.170 --> 29:30.649
That's in the right mode.

29:33.810 --> 29:35.569
Here we go, here we go.

29:51.248 --> 29:52.768
Evening.

30:09.887 --> 30:12.448
Are you a bloke?

30:12.448 --> 30:14.007
Um, yeah.

30:14.007 --> 30:15.807
So you're not actually...

30:15.807 --> 30:17.807
Cher isn't a man?

30:17.807 --> 30:21.687
No, I'm a man that plays Cher.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.647
Right.

30:25.847 --> 30:27.847
I could really use a burger
right now.

30:27.847 --> 30:30.326
Right. Well, that's my
kind of language.

30:30.326 --> 30:32.246
I'll see what I can do, sir/madam.

30:46.725 --> 30:51.086
Hang on, was that one of those,
um... What are they called?

30:51.086 --> 30:53.965
Cross-dressing things? And then that
wasn't really Cher?

30:53.965 --> 30:56.846
Yeah. Apparently that Cher
is actually called Steve.

30:56.846 --> 31:01.605
But didn't you spot the difference?
I mean, the Adam's apple and the...

31:01.605 --> 31:03.724
Never mind. No.
We'll gloss over that.

31:03.724 --> 31:06.645
The Range Rover, is it real?
Does it feel like a proper one?

31:06.645 --> 31:09.964
I think it does because it does
work really well off road,

31:09.964 --> 31:12.205
and it does have that...
It feels special.

31:12.205 --> 31:16.524
And I have to say, it looks
fantastic. I mean, really brilliant.

31:16.524 --> 31:19.563
It does look fantastic
and it looks even better like that.

31:19.563 --> 31:23.204
That's the three-door. Yes, that's
true. But there is a problem.

31:23.204 --> 31:26.563
So you arrive at it - the
three-door one - with your toddler.

31:26.563 --> 31:32.683
It's raining, you've got to get the
toddler in the back, and you pull
the seat forward...

31:32.683 --> 31:34.683
Unless you're David Beckham

31:34.683 --> 31:38.323
and you could just sort of pop
it in like that...

31:38.323 --> 31:40.323
You are a half-wit. Look.

31:40.323 --> 31:46.203
Press that. Oh, yes, still raining,
still holding your toddler, bored,
very bored.

31:46.203 --> 31:48.442
Can't be bothered to wait any more.

31:48.442 --> 31:54.482
Let's move on because
it is time to put a star -
a Grand Prix star, no less -

31:54.482 --> 31:57.282
in our old reasonably-priced car.

31:57.282 --> 32:01.842
My guest tonight is a German who won
last year's World Championship.

32:01.842 --> 32:06.562
And this year's, he's already
put his towel on that as well.

32:06.562 --> 32:08.881
Ladies and gentlemen,
Sebastian Vettel!

32:12.441 --> 32:14.401
Here he is - the World Champion.

32:16.201 --> 32:18.401
The World Champion is among us.

32:19.880 --> 32:21.120
Have a seat, Sebastian.

32:24.641 --> 32:28.080
Now, obviously, first of all,

32:28.080 --> 32:31.720
huge congratulations on your win
this afternoon.

32:31.720 --> 32:35.320
The problem is, obviously,
it's Wednesday now...

32:35.320 --> 32:39.480
but when this goes out
on television...
I see. Now I've got it. OK.

32:39.480 --> 32:43.079
I'm usually not that slow.
So we've just run a few options.

32:45.720 --> 32:49.119
What a shame -
pipped at the last moment.

32:50.319 --> 32:53.239
And then that mistake
half a lap to the end.

32:53.239 --> 32:55.119
What were you thinking of, man?!

32:55.119 --> 33:00.118
Who could have imagined a giant
meteorite would land on the track

33:00.118 --> 33:02.479
and stop the race like that?

33:02.479 --> 33:05.358
Now, a lot of people have been
saying it's a boring season,

33:05.358 --> 33:08.559
you know that you're going to
win every time you watch.

33:08.559 --> 33:12.678
But it probably isn't boring
from where you're sitting, is it?
Never, no.

33:12.678 --> 33:14.518
I mean, I enjoy it, you know.

33:14.518 --> 33:17.478
I think the races are
quite exciting, from what I see.

33:17.478 --> 33:21.997
Obviously I can't follow them live.
Well, it would be tricky.

33:21.997 --> 33:26.757
You probably could. A bit in the
monitors around. Do you actually
watch the screens?

33:26.757 --> 33:29.117
Yes. You do? Sometimes, yeah.

33:29.117 --> 33:33.997
It's not because I have so much time
and I am so much ahead,

33:33.997 --> 33:36.717
but it's sometimes quite useful
to see what's going on.

33:36.717 --> 33:43.356
Obviously, when they are
showing some... Crashes.
Some birds, then it's...

33:43.356 --> 33:48.716
Valencia was, let's be honest,
a bit boring. I'm afraid
I was fast asleep.

33:48.716 --> 33:52.356
Valencia, you just can't help...
May be that comes with age. It is.

33:57.476 --> 34:01.715
Sunday afternoon nod-off.

34:01.715 --> 34:06.355
Anyway, I'll run through some
of your achievements. The
youngest ever world champion.

34:06.355 --> 34:11.235
The youngest person ever to win a
Grand Prix, the youngest ever to get
a pole position,

34:11.235 --> 34:16.994
the youngest person ever to score
a point, and the youngest person
ever to score a fastest lap.

34:16.994 --> 34:19.235
What were you like as a baby?

34:19.235 --> 34:25.475
"And the first to use a lavatory..."

34:25.475 --> 34:32.873
Were you always a competitive child?
I think I was always competitive.
I'm not sure about the lavatory bit.

34:32.873 --> 34:36.554
I think it took me quite a while
to understand, you know,

34:36.554 --> 34:39.592
where you should
and where you shouldn't...

34:39.592 --> 34:42.793
We've got a picture - just to
demonstrate how young you were -

34:42.793 --> 34:45.953
of you meeting our old Stig
for the first time.

34:45.953 --> 34:49.592
There you go, look.

34:49.592 --> 34:52.353
I think that's an endearing picture.
What was happening?

34:52.353 --> 34:57.233
1995. You were...? Seven.

34:57.233 --> 35:00.992
There was a championship in Kerpen,
which is Michael's hometown.

35:00.992 --> 35:05.992
That must have been a special
moment for a seven-year-old, to meet
Schumacher. Was he world champion?

35:05.992 --> 35:10.711
Yes, double world champion.
What's it like know
when you lap him?

35:10.711 --> 35:15.472
Do you think, "God, this is
terrible"? I don't think
of this picture, for a start.

35:15.472 --> 35:17.111
Is it weird?
It is a bit weird.

35:17.111 --> 35:22.111
You know, for me, when I was
karting, Michael was the one
I was looking up to.

35:22.111 --> 35:25.111
So, when you lap him now,
do you go like that?

35:29.431 --> 35:31.231
No, I mean... It must be tempting.

35:31.231 --> 35:34.230
You know, the thing is,
of course, he's a legend,

35:34.230 --> 35:38.590
and there's things I can learn from
people like him, drivers like him.

35:38.590 --> 35:40.590
Can I just ask you to be honest now?

35:40.590 --> 35:44.350
How much of your current success
is down to that Red Bull car?

35:44.350 --> 35:46.510
The one we've got over there,
in fact.

35:46.510 --> 35:51.470
Because Lewis Hamilton said
it's just unbelievably quick
following the Red Bull car.

35:51.470 --> 35:56.829
Again, it depends. Our car,
people know, and we know, our
strength is in high-speed corners

35:56.829 --> 35:59.350
because we do produce
a lot of downforce.

35:59.350 --> 36:04.749
But he didn't talk you through,
probably, other tracks where they
gain more than half a second

36:04.749 --> 36:09.229
down the straights. You know
Adrian Newey because he designed
the car that you drive.

36:09.229 --> 36:10.789
I got to know him, yeah.

36:10.789 --> 36:14.709
I was at school with him.
He told me that.

36:14.709 --> 36:18.228
Yeah, he used to copy me in physics.
Really?

36:18.228 --> 36:20.028
Yeah, it was really annoying.

36:20.028 --> 36:25.108
He didn't mention that bit.
Mention it to him because I remember
coming up with a double diffuser

36:25.108 --> 36:27.348
and the KERS system,
just doodling, really.

36:27.348 --> 36:30.868
And he was like... You know those
really annoying people at school?

36:30.868 --> 36:33.268
Exactly. You might like to mention
that to him.

36:33.268 --> 36:34.987
And you give all your cars names?

36:34.987 --> 36:37.708
The racing cars.
Yeah. What are these names?

36:37.708 --> 36:44.347
Brian? No. Not Brian? No. Roger?
No, this year is Kinky Kylie.

36:46.347 --> 36:51.106
It's got a nice back end, you know,
so...

36:51.106 --> 36:53.467
Last year it was Luscious Liz.

36:53.467 --> 36:57.946
Luscious Liz? Yeah. The year before
it was Kate's Dirty Sister.

37:01.346 --> 37:04.986
Now, you're a big fan,
I understand, of Britain,

37:04.986 --> 37:07.225
but British comedy in particular.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.106
Is that right? Correct.

37:09.106 --> 37:14.345
At the moment I'm quite into
Little Britain. I think that one
is very popular. Yeah.

37:14.345 --> 37:17.705
I even went to London once to
see them live. Did you? Yeah.

37:17.705 --> 37:22.345
It was quite funny up to the point
where they tried to play
that game, hide the sausage,

37:22.345 --> 37:25.465
and he actually tried to...

37:25.465 --> 37:29.584
And are you a Python fan?
Did somebody tell me you like
Monty Python? Yeah, I do.

37:29.584 --> 37:33.825
The first time I saw was
The Life of Brian, the movie.

37:33.825 --> 37:37.984
I saw it in German
and I found it was funny.

37:37.984 --> 37:40.824
And then I saw the English version
and I loved it.

37:40.824 --> 37:46.584
It's the same thing, actually,
this show, they show in Germany now
for a couple of years,

37:46.584 --> 37:49.104
but you speaking German.

37:49.104 --> 37:50.584
No!

37:50.584 --> 37:53.223
Yeah. And it...

37:53.223 --> 37:57.983
No, I won't have that!
German? No!

37:57.983 --> 38:00.823
And it just doesn't work, you know?

38:00.823 --> 38:04.823
I can sort of believe that.

38:04.823 --> 38:10.223
One of the reasons why it's easy to
appreciate British humour is, if you
speak really properly good English,

38:10.223 --> 38:11.463
which you...

38:11.463 --> 38:13.142
And you even do accents.

38:14.662 --> 38:17.102
That's a yes, isn't it?
That was just a yes.

38:17.102 --> 38:19.102
Not that I kno-ow of.

38:20.582 --> 38:22.342
Can you do Birmingham?

38:22.342 --> 38:26.462
Actually, Adrian brought me
close to that Brummie accent

38:26.462 --> 38:29.981
because he told some stories
about Nigel Mansell in the past,

38:29.981 --> 38:32.742
about the chicane in Monza where
he was, I don't know,

38:32.742 --> 38:35.981
10 or 20kph quicker than
Piquet at that time.

38:35.981 --> 38:41.701
And Piquet didn't understand,
and then Patrick Head went to
Nigel, Adrian obviously was there,

38:41.701 --> 38:46.700
asking what he's doing. And he says,
"I just take my hand..."

38:51.221 --> 38:55.580
"I just turn
my knuckles around the wheel
and just go straight."

38:58.260 --> 38:59.980
That's fantastic.

39:02.979 --> 39:05.700
Anyway, obviously you've done
many Formula 1 races

39:05.700 --> 39:09.219
and you've been successful
in a lot of them.

39:09.219 --> 39:11.820
Today is the most important
day of your career so far

39:11.820 --> 39:14.979
because you're here to do our lap.
Yes, yes.

39:14.979 --> 39:19.459
How did it go out there?
I have no idea. I don't know.

39:19.459 --> 39:23.979
Usually you have reference, people
tell you thumbs up, not so good.

39:23.979 --> 39:28.819
Cos they don't tell you how your lap
was. The thing is you have got only
that car and, you know,

39:28.819 --> 39:33.578
I cannot come into the pits and say,
"It's rubbish, change this,
change that."

39:33.578 --> 39:36.698
You know, I can complain but...
Nobody bothers.

39:36.698 --> 39:40.338
You did ask if you could check the
tyre pressures before setting off.

39:40.338 --> 39:42.458
Yes. That's quite German.

39:42.458 --> 39:45.698
Nobody else has said,
"Can we check the tyre pressure?"

39:45.698 --> 39:50.698
Cos this is the only opportunity,
really, where Formula 1 drivers
get to drive the same car

39:50.698 --> 39:53.297
to see how you compare
to all the others.

39:53.297 --> 39:54.977
Yeah, so that's why I'm...

39:57.097 --> 40:00.697
Who'd like to see Sebastian's lap?
ALL: Yes!

40:00.697 --> 40:03.216
Let's have a look.

40:06.297 --> 40:07.377
Lot of wheelspin.

40:07.377 --> 40:09.696
Enough power to spin the wheels.

40:10.736 --> 40:12.256
But not much after that.

40:12.256 --> 40:14.416
Come on.

40:14.416 --> 40:17.136
Must say it's nice to see
the old Liana back.

40:17.136 --> 40:18.296
There we are, look,

40:18.296 --> 40:21.496
a Formula 1 driver
again taking the wide line there.

40:24.616 --> 40:29.816
Think I could have a cup of tea
before the next corner.

40:31.055 --> 40:33.575
Chicago. Not running wide.

40:35.175 --> 40:36.415
Well, it seems stupid...

40:36.415 --> 40:39.335
With these things
you will never be on time!

40:41.135 --> 40:43.454
Obsessed with punctuality
even there.

40:43.454 --> 40:46.135
I don't want to say,
"Do you keep it in the lines?"

40:46.135 --> 40:48.974
because you are the Formula 1
world champion, and you have.

40:51.294 --> 40:54.294
And you manage to keep it under
control on the way out as well,

40:54.294 --> 40:55.454
unsurprisingly.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.214
This thing is really slow.

40:57.214 --> 40:58.733
It isn't. Listen to it!

40:58.733 --> 41:02.214
Tortured tyres.
Going through the follow-through.

41:02.214 --> 41:05.293
92, 93, 94 mph.

41:05.293 --> 41:06.613
Pretty quick.

41:06.613 --> 41:07.774
Very quick.

41:07.774 --> 41:10.053
Did that hurt? The jolt?

41:11.653 --> 41:13.373
It's a good car.

41:13.373 --> 41:15.013
It is. Superb.

41:15.013 --> 41:17.813
And into Gambon.
Any two-wheel action?

41:17.813 --> 41:19.173
None at all. There we are.

41:19.173 --> 41:21.332
Ladies and gentlemen,
across the line!

41:26.892 --> 41:28.252
What's very funny now...

41:30.092 --> 41:33.012
You just leant back,
but you did the interview like that.

41:33.012 --> 41:34.332
Then you were like that.

41:34.332 --> 41:35.972
Yeah.

41:35.972 --> 41:37.971
Where do you think you've come?

41:39.092 --> 41:40.732
It was very windy, did you see?

41:42.331 --> 41:45.411
Can you imagine the headwind
accelerating when you have no power?

41:45.411 --> 41:47.012
Any more excuses?

41:47.012 --> 41:49.011
I have a couple lined up. Let's see.

41:49.011 --> 41:50.851
You're leaning forwards.

41:52.731 --> 41:57.051
Well, the fastest we've ever had
is Rubens Barrichello,

41:57.051 --> 41:58.970
who did it in 1.443.

41:58.970 --> 42:03.491
You did it in one minute...

42:03.491 --> 42:05.530
Good start.

42:05.530 --> 42:06.970
40...

42:08.050 --> 42:09.491
4...

42:09.491 --> 42:12.210
Ooh!

42:15.609 --> 42:16.810
Dead.

42:18.130 --> 42:19.530
There you go!

42:21.849 --> 42:23.329
Fastest F1 driver we've had!

42:28.449 --> 42:31.289
Hang on. Hang on.

42:31.289 --> 42:32.849
Wait. I just had a thought.

42:34.009 --> 42:35.969
Why are we all surprised?

42:37.648 --> 42:39.288
I'm surprised.

42:39.288 --> 42:43.328
Come on! That you're faster
than a 62-year-old Brazilian?!

42:45.528 --> 42:47.688
I met the Stig.
I'm faster than the Stig.

42:47.688 --> 42:50.528
No, no, this is OLD Stig.
We should get rid of him.

42:51.568 --> 42:53.967
New Stig hasn't yet been round.

42:53.967 --> 42:55.007
Yeah, he said.

42:55.007 --> 42:58.888
There's a rumour he can do it
in 56-57 seconds. A rumour.

42:58.888 --> 43:00.207
Some say, you mean.

43:00.207 --> 43:01.567
Some say.

43:05.727 --> 43:09.367
Ladies and gentlemen...
Now I can lean back.

43:09.367 --> 43:11.367
Now I can lean back.

43:11.367 --> 43:16.206
You can lean back now.
You can relax. Well done for today.

43:17.286 --> 43:18.767
It's fantastic to meet you.

43:18.767 --> 43:22.846
Anglophile, good guy. Ladies
and gentlemen, Sebastian Vettel!

43:30.566 --> 43:35.926
Now, this is the Nissan Pixo

43:35.926 --> 43:38.605
and it is the cheapest car
on sale in the UK right now.

43:38.605 --> 43:41.485
It costs just £6,995.

43:41.485 --> 43:45.645
It sounds fantastic, but is it?

43:45.645 --> 43:47.685
Jeremy decided to find out.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.405
Well, here it is.

43:54.565 --> 43:58.045
It's built in India and it has
a one-litre, three-cylinder engine,

43:58.045 --> 43:59.845
so it's very slow.

44:01.044 --> 44:04.164
Also it doesn't look very nice,
it isn't very spacious

44:04.164 --> 44:08.684
and it comes with less equipment
that a cave.

44:09.804 --> 44:12.643
You do get power steering
and anti-lock brakes.

44:12.643 --> 44:13.684
Argh, ducks!

44:14.804 --> 44:18.083
Missed them. Thank you, anti-lock
brakes. Working well there.

44:18.083 --> 44:22.164
You also get a radio, and a dial!

44:23.763 --> 44:26.363
But if you want
to get the window down,

44:26.363 --> 44:30.843
you have to move this lever
in an anti-clockwise direction.

44:30.843 --> 44:34.882
To get it up again, you move it
in a clockwise direction.

44:36.003 --> 44:38.363
And it's a similar story
with the door mirrors.

44:38.363 --> 44:40.682
They're operated
by these funny prongs.

44:41.722 --> 44:43.322
You don't even get any carpets.

44:44.482 --> 44:45.962
But if you pay an extra £37,

44:45.962 --> 44:48.082
Nissan will sell you what they call

44:48.082 --> 44:52.162
luxury velour textile floor mats.

44:52.162 --> 44:55.761
If you spend £3 on top of that,

44:55.761 --> 44:59.322
they will give you
a Nissan-branded toggle bag,

44:59.322 --> 45:03.641
containing both a sponge
and a sachet of car shampoo.

45:05.521 --> 45:08.881
Of course, you might say
that for less than £7,000,

45:08.881 --> 45:13.600
you should expect to do without
speed and space and looks

45:13.600 --> 45:16.321
and electric windows and carpets.

45:16.321 --> 45:18.720
But do you have to?

45:18.720 --> 45:22.321
Because what does £6,995 buy you

45:22.321 --> 45:26.160
if you're prepared to ferret around
on the second-hand market?

45:27.880 --> 45:29.719
This for a kick-off.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.719
This is a Bentley Turbo R.

45:37.639 --> 45:40.999
It's 23 years old,
it's done 122,000 miles

45:40.999 --> 45:47.879
and this actual car is for sale
right now for £6,995.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.319
For all this!

45:49.319 --> 45:51.878
I mean, look at it!

45:51.878 --> 45:54.079
Not a Nissan, no.

45:54.079 --> 45:58.478
What it is is a Bentley that I'm in,
for the same money.

45:58.478 --> 46:03.038
It's got five more cylinders
than the Nissan and a turbocharger,

46:03.038 --> 46:05.118
so it is MUCH faster.

46:05.118 --> 46:08.678
And the luxury lambswool mats
are included in the price.

46:10.518 --> 46:11.878
If I operate this button,

46:11.878 --> 46:14.077
my window goes up and down.

46:14.077 --> 46:17.118
With this button, I can move my seat
backwards and forwards.

46:17.118 --> 46:20.117
With this button, I can adjust
my horns. I can have a twin horn.

46:21.477 --> 46:25.077
Very nice. Or a single one. No.
I'll just have a twin one.

46:27.637 --> 46:33.677
Back in 1988,
this car cost someone £79,000.

46:33.677 --> 46:37.236
Here we are now and you can buy it
for less than a tenth of that.

46:39.076 --> 46:40.356
I mean, look!

46:40.356 --> 46:45.316
Leather, leather, leather, leather.
Wood. Leather, leather, leather.

46:45.316 --> 46:51.116
Leather. Leather. Leather.

46:51.116 --> 46:53.795
It is genuinely unbelievable

46:53.795 --> 46:58.035
that that car costs exactly the same
as this car.

46:58.035 --> 47:00.275
Of course, we're not thick.
Well, he is.

47:00.275 --> 47:04.275
But even he knows that the Bentley
was hand-made in England

47:04.275 --> 47:08.194
and saying something was hand-made
in England is just a way of saying

47:08.194 --> 47:09.594
the door's going to fall off.

47:09.594 --> 47:12.275
This isn't going to be
as reliable as the Nissan.

47:12.275 --> 47:17.794
When stuff does go wrong with this,
the bills are going to be MASSIVE.

47:17.794 --> 47:19.794
They are, they are.
Don't worry though.

47:19.794 --> 47:23.874
It turns out
there are many, many alternatives.

47:25.233 --> 47:27.754
All of the cars here
are on the market right now

47:27.754 --> 47:31.433
for less than the price
of that Nissan Pixo.

47:34.594 --> 47:37.673
The Honda S2000, for example.

47:37.673 --> 47:41.593
This one is now for sale with 47,000
miles on the clock

47:41.593 --> 47:44.993
for £6,500.

47:44.993 --> 47:46.992
And you could have a Mazda RX8.

47:46.992 --> 47:50.193
Look, four doors,
like the Nissan Pixo.

47:50.193 --> 47:52.752
This one has done 28,000 miles.

47:52.752 --> 47:56.352
It's new! It's a brand new car!

47:56.352 --> 48:00.312
Subaru Impreza, in budget, in the
correct blue and gold alloys. Lovely.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.552
WRX, this one. It is.

48:01.552 --> 48:03.551
Could you get an STI in budget?

48:03.551 --> 48:06.952
No. P1. No. RB5. Now you're
just saying letters and numbers.

48:06.952 --> 48:08.911
SK1?
That's the postcode for Stockport.

48:08.911 --> 48:11.151
It's done 37,000 miles.

48:11.151 --> 48:12.832
What?

48:12.832 --> 48:14.871
It's only done 37,000?

48:14.871 --> 48:17.311
It's got everything on it.

48:17.311 --> 48:20.231
Electric mirrors, air-con.
Air conditioning.

48:20.231 --> 48:21.471
£6,500.

48:21.471 --> 48:22.631
That's fantastic.

48:22.631 --> 48:28.471
Of course, some of the cars we found
are cheap because they're rubbish.

48:28.471 --> 48:32.390
But most aren't, like this Alpha,
this Jag,

48:32.390 --> 48:33.950
all these BMWs.

48:33.950 --> 48:36.230
We even found a Porsche.

48:40.630 --> 48:44.390
It's done 88,000 miles
and it feels tight as a drum

48:44.390 --> 48:46.910
and you are driving about
in a convertible Porsche.

48:46.910 --> 48:48.109
That's what worries me.

48:48.109 --> 48:50.829
Do you think we look a bit... Manly.

48:50.829 --> 48:53.509
No. Tough.
No, the opposite of those things.

48:53.509 --> 48:54.549
Hello there.

48:55.749 --> 48:57.669
We're talking about football.

48:57.669 --> 49:00.069
I'm just going to spit
out of the window.

49:00.069 --> 49:02.349
Can we go and have a look
at some fighter jets?

49:05.148 --> 49:06.789
Ready, go, go, go.

49:11.828 --> 49:14.548
There. It just does
a sort of raaaaah.

49:14.548 --> 49:18.708
It makes a great noise,
they are incredibly well-balanced.

49:18.708 --> 49:23.308
It is hard to think of a better car
for £6,500, or £6,900, than this.

49:25.627 --> 49:28.947
That gave us an idea
for a challenge.

49:28.947 --> 49:32.627
Which one of us could buy
the most amazing car

49:32.627 --> 49:34.267
for the price of a Nissan Pixo?

49:40.667 --> 49:41.747
This is my choice.

49:43.026 --> 49:49.466
A Mercedes CL which I found
on the internet for £6,995.

49:52.706 --> 49:56.386
What makes that price particularly
extraordinary

49:56.386 --> 49:59.425
is that this is the top-of-the-range
model, the V12.

49:59.425 --> 50:01.466
It comes with just about everything.

50:01.466 --> 50:04.545
It has a television,
it has radar-guided cruise control

50:04.545 --> 50:07.585
that maintains a set distance
to the car in front.

50:07.585 --> 50:09.586
It has voice-activated controls.

50:09.586 --> 50:14.145
It has seats that massage you
as you drive along.

50:14.145 --> 50:16.705
If you bought the equivalent
of this car today,

50:16.705 --> 50:19.905
it would cost you £161,000.

50:19.905 --> 50:23.424
And that makes this
the bargain of the century.

50:23.424 --> 50:24.545
No, it isn't.

50:24.545 --> 50:26.025
Because THIS is.

50:26.025 --> 50:27.704
The BMW 850ci.

50:27.704 --> 50:31.904
It too has a V12 engine.
Not the lesser V8-engined 840.

50:31.904 --> 50:36.384
But what makes this car
better than Jeremy's is...

50:36.384 --> 50:38.223
Pop up headlamps.

50:38.223 --> 50:39.504
Simple as that.

50:39.504 --> 50:43.343
How much did you pay for this?
£6,700. Yours?

50:44.583 --> 50:49.463
£6,995. Less! How old is it?
'94... 17 years old.

50:49.463 --> 50:52.183
Ahem, nine. Really?

50:52.183 --> 50:56.823
Nine years old.
How many miles has it done? 127.

50:56.823 --> 51:00.022
54,000. Rubbish!

51:00.022 --> 51:03.863
Why does it have casters from a sofa
instead of wheels?

51:03.863 --> 51:07.862
OK, it's period.
They were that size in those days.

51:07.862 --> 51:10.382
What are they? 17? 16? 16-inch.

51:10.382 --> 51:11.822
16-inch wheels.

51:11.822 --> 51:13.702
And you know full well

51:13.702 --> 51:16.261
that means fatter tyres
and that means a better ride.

51:16.261 --> 51:19.342
It's got Smarties for wheels.
And is that ruched leather?

51:19.342 --> 51:22.581
Oh, yes. Yes, it is.

51:22.581 --> 51:24.621
Why do people from Birmingham
like a ruche?!

51:27.141 --> 51:29.901
To find out which of us
had bought the best car,

51:29.901 --> 51:32.500
we decided to conduct
a series of tests,

51:32.500 --> 51:35.541
starting, not unsurprisingly,
with speed.

51:37.661 --> 51:40.780
This is a 1.8 mile runway

51:40.780 --> 51:44.580
and all we wanted to know is
who'd get to the far end first.

51:46.620 --> 51:50.140
Of course, what matters most of all
in a race like this is power

51:50.140 --> 51:52.780
and the simple fact
is I have more of it.

51:52.780 --> 51:54.579
A lot more. And more talk.

51:56.580 --> 52:00.699
Because my car has pop-up headlamps,
it is sleeker at the front,

52:00.699 --> 52:05.899
more aerodynamic and, in a race
like this, aerodynamics matter.

52:05.899 --> 52:09.499
3, 2, 1, go!

52:10.539 --> 52:12.979
Yeah! Oh...

52:15.739 --> 52:17.538
And that is a goodbye, Hammond.

52:17.538 --> 52:21.459
His car is limited, top speed 155.

52:21.459 --> 52:26.338
BMW, not limited. Top speed, 156.

52:27.539 --> 52:31.938
I can still whisper.
130 miles an hour.

52:33.257 --> 52:35.097
140.

52:35.097 --> 52:39.457
He's ahead, yes,
but soon he will hit the limiter

52:39.457 --> 52:41.697
and I will surge past.

52:41.697 --> 52:45.817
155 miles an hour.

52:45.817 --> 52:48.577
But that surging thing
didn't happen.

52:48.577 --> 52:49.736
Kack!

52:50.977 --> 52:53.177
What a machine!

52:53.177 --> 52:56.136
We pulled over for a post-race chat.

52:57.856 --> 53:02.576
Hello! Hello! Can I just say,
what happened there?

53:02.576 --> 53:05.216
Well, obviously the BM lost.

53:05.216 --> 53:08.776
The weirdest thing was, as we
crossed the finishing line
at the end,

53:08.776 --> 53:10.296
mine changed up,

53:10.296 --> 53:15.376
so I think given a longer runway,
like 50 miles longer...

53:15.376 --> 53:17.455
Yes, yes, yes. I would have won.

53:17.455 --> 53:20.415
Have you ever run a race
while carrying a television. No.

53:20.415 --> 53:24.215
And a sideboard. I've got a
television and a sideboard in here.

53:24.215 --> 53:28.095
Can I also say I want one of these
phones on a cord in my car.

53:32.175 --> 53:35.614
To try and understand
why Hammond's car was so slow,

53:35.614 --> 53:39.255
we put it on a machine that would
reveal how many horsepowers

53:39.255 --> 53:40.934
had escaped over the years.

53:40.934 --> 53:43.094
There's no need to tether it.

53:43.094 --> 53:45.014
Got to shackle this beast down.

53:45.014 --> 53:47.654
It took nearly an hour to get down
that runaway. No, it didn't.

53:49.094 --> 53:51.773
Soon the machine gave us an answer.

53:53.134 --> 53:54.974
How many was it?
296 when it was new.

53:54.974 --> 53:57.173
296 horsepower
for your five-litre engine.

53:57.173 --> 54:02.653
How many years old? 17 years old.
269 at the flywheel.

54:02.653 --> 54:05.053
27 horses have escaped.

54:05.053 --> 54:07.973
Less than two a year. You could
eat that many horses a year.

54:07.973 --> 54:10.213
Perhaps you're just
a rubbish driver.

54:10.213 --> 54:13.292
We then decided
to test the Mercedes.

54:13.292 --> 54:17.133
Jet noise. That's not the car!

54:18.092 --> 54:23.532
To start with,
362 brake horse power. Yes.

54:23.532 --> 54:25.612
Today, after nine years... Yes.

54:25.612 --> 54:27.092
352.

54:27.092 --> 54:28.572
352.

54:28.572 --> 54:31.532
So my car has lost
fewer horsepower than yours,

54:31.532 --> 54:34.012
is faster than yours,

54:34.012 --> 54:38.091
has much more equipment than yours.

54:38.091 --> 54:41.411
It hasn't got pop-up headlamps
and the leather is NOT ruched!

54:43.811 --> 54:46.651
We then checked out
our cars' interiors

54:46.651 --> 54:49.171
using our old friend Mr Manlove

54:49.171 --> 54:51.970
and his team of forensic experts.

54:51.970 --> 54:54.931
You know the last time we tested
cars like this on Top Gear,

54:54.931 --> 54:58.650
didn't we find that yours
was full of blood and mucus?

54:58.650 --> 55:00.050
Yeah. And faeces.

55:01.130 --> 55:06.490
After a microscopic examination,
Manlove was ready with the results.

55:06.490 --> 55:09.089
Why don't you go first,
since you usually lose these.

55:09.089 --> 55:10.450
All right then.

55:10.450 --> 55:13.449
With the BMW, first of all,
we're lacking faeces this time.

55:13.449 --> 55:16.049
No faeces for me! No faeces.

55:16.049 --> 55:19.169
We do have plenty of saliva,
which you would expect.

55:19.169 --> 55:20.409
It's on the car phone.

55:20.409 --> 55:23.689
When you talk, obviously little
spatters of saliva...

55:23.689 --> 55:24.808
I held it.

55:24.808 --> 55:26.929
We also had a lot of material

55:26.929 --> 55:29.688
which looked like
rolled nasal mucus again.

55:29.688 --> 55:33.929
What nasal mucus? Rolled.

55:33.929 --> 55:36.568
As in... Picking and flicking.
Absolutely.

55:37.608 --> 55:41.088
Finally,
there was an odour of urine.

55:41.088 --> 55:42.688
Somebody has wet themselves.

55:42.688 --> 55:44.648
It was a general pervading aroma.

55:44.648 --> 55:47.327
I'm in another lavatory!

55:47.327 --> 55:49.288
Right, the Mercedes.

55:49.288 --> 55:53.967
There was some white powder found
on tapings,

55:53.967 --> 55:55.887
as was some herbal material

55:55.887 --> 55:58.127
that looked like it had been cut
or chopped.

55:58.127 --> 56:01.527
We didn't do any further testing on
that. White powder sounds like talc.

56:01.527 --> 56:03.166
Could be talcum powder. Flour!

56:03.166 --> 56:08.246
Moving on to the front passenger
seat, there was a rhinestone.

56:08.246 --> 56:12.887
We had chemical reactions
that we would frequently find

56:12.887 --> 56:15.126
if we were examining different
types of cases

56:15.126 --> 56:17.366
on potentially vaginal swabs.

56:17.366 --> 56:20.006
Vaginal...
Material on the passenger seat.

56:25.365 --> 56:27.926
Mine was a drooling businessman
flicking bogies,

56:27.926 --> 56:30.565
wet himself. Yours...
Was an interesting bloke.

56:30.565 --> 56:35.206
Could the rhinestone
come from a vajazzle? What's that?

56:35.206 --> 56:38.365
They don't have them in
Herefordshire where you live.

56:38.365 --> 56:40.685
I'm seeing a magic stick
that you wave at things.

56:40.685 --> 56:41.764
No, it isn't that.

56:43.605 --> 56:45.485
With Manlove's test complete,

56:45.485 --> 56:50.365
we took our cars onto the road to
see what they're like on the... road.

56:55.364 --> 56:59.204
Oh, yeah. Headlamps popping up.
Ooh, yeah.

56:59.204 --> 57:01.684
I'll put them away.

57:03.763 --> 57:05.043
Just feels great.

57:05.043 --> 57:07.924
It doesn't feel old-fashioned,
outdated or second hand.

57:07.924 --> 57:11.083
There's just not a clue
that this is anything other

57:11.083 --> 57:12.923
than an incredibly expensive car.

57:12.923 --> 57:16.963
Rear roller blind, yep,
that's working well.

57:16.963 --> 57:20.082
Put it in sport mode, that works.

57:20.082 --> 57:24.283
Raise the suspension up, lower it,
turn the traction control off.

57:24.283 --> 57:26.202
Cruise control.

57:26.202 --> 57:29.083
In some ways, it's not really
a rival for the Nissan Pixo,

57:29.083 --> 57:31.802
but it is a rival
for a brand new Mercedes.

57:31.802 --> 57:34.802
You do have to ask,
why would you buy one?

57:34.802 --> 57:38.642
Let me just try the linguatronic,
make sure that's working OK.

57:40.122 --> 57:41.162
Radio Two.

57:43.161 --> 57:49.441
'Capital. Radio 4. News Direct.
Cancel.'

57:50.681 --> 57:52.682
That's working brilliantly.

57:52.682 --> 57:56.561
Exactly like every linguatronic
system I've ever encountered.

57:56.561 --> 57:58.241
Total disobedience!

57:59.760 --> 58:03.561
Soon, we pulled over
in the town of Market Harborough

58:03.561 --> 58:06.440
to conduct a little experiment.

58:06.440 --> 58:12.960
This Mercedes, V12, how much
do you reckon? 20, 25. 20 or 25.

58:12.960 --> 58:15.039
27 grand. 27 grand?

58:15.039 --> 58:17.080
12 or 13. 12 or 13?

58:17.080 --> 58:20.599
It's a V12 BMW, what would you think
that was for sale for

58:20.599 --> 58:22.319
if it was for sale today?

58:22.319 --> 58:24.640
About 12,000. 12,000?

58:24.640 --> 58:26.719
40 to 50,000.

58:26.719 --> 58:28.279
What about this car, sir?

58:28.279 --> 58:30.639
It's a V12 also.
It's done 54,000 miles.

58:30.639 --> 58:32.159
20, something like that.

58:32.159 --> 58:34.119
If your neighbour
put that on the drive,

58:34.119 --> 58:36.079
you'd think,
"They've done all right."

58:39.359 --> 58:40.959
It's as we thought.

58:40.959 --> 58:45.838
People think these cars are worth
far more than we actually paid.

58:45.838 --> 58:49.838
So what we have here
are two V12 super coupes,

58:49.838 --> 58:52.638
blasting through
the heart of England

58:52.638 --> 58:57.638
silently, quickly,
comfortably and cheaply.

59:05.797 --> 59:07.757
If the Nissan's done one thing
for us,

59:07.757 --> 59:11.317
it's let us know that these cars are
out there for that kind of money.

59:14.757 --> 59:16.676
It's a complete no-brainer.

59:30.836 --> 59:33.156
I know. I know.

59:33.156 --> 59:35.996
I honestly believe...

59:35.996 --> 59:38.075
I believe we really are
on to something here.

59:38.075 --> 59:40.516
They are both brilliant. What?!

59:40.516 --> 59:43.955
Have you two taken
complete leave of your senses?

59:43.955 --> 59:48.156
Why?! Because anybody who buys
an ancient V12 coupe

59:48.156 --> 59:51.235
instead of the economical
three-cylinder little hatchback

59:51.235 --> 59:54.035
is going to end up bankrupt
and living in a skip.

59:54.035 --> 59:57.915
Listen, Captain Killjoy!
How do you know?

59:57.915 --> 01:00:01.194
A modern Formula 1 car doesn't
break down, so what makes you think

01:00:01.194 --> 01:00:04.995
that a relatively modern
road car is going to break down?

01:00:04.995 --> 01:00:06.994
Because Formula 1 cars

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:10.594
are not owned by people
who fill them with...

01:00:10.594 --> 01:00:13.074
with snot and lady juice.

01:00:13.074 --> 01:00:15.154
Nelson Piquet did.

01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:17.473
Anyway, we anticipated
your objections

01:00:17.473 --> 01:00:21.514
and we didn't just borrow these cars
to drive, we actually bought them.

01:00:21.514 --> 01:00:22.913
What, with money?

01:00:22.913 --> 01:00:26.393
Yes, and we're going to run them
for a while and report back

01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:30.353
and inform the viewers
on just how reliable they are.

01:00:30.353 --> 01:00:33.712
Really? I am prepared to bet you two
all of my hair

01:00:33.712 --> 01:00:36.553
that within two weeks,
one of these has gone bang.

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.952
James, there will be no bombshell.

01:00:41.272 --> 01:00:45.432
And on that bombshell,
it is time to end. I do apologise.

01:00:45.432 --> 01:00:47.272
Tonight's show has been about cars.

01:00:47.272 --> 01:00:49.511
Even the guest.
Even the guest was a driver.

01:00:49.511 --> 01:00:52.832
Don't worry, next week,
normal service is resumed.

01:00:52.832 --> 01:00:55.351
There are many accidents
and a light fire.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:56.911
We'll see them. Good night.

01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:14.831
