And now she's off acting
like a filly again.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.236
What's so bad about that?

11:11.238 --> 11:13.405
If she keeps gallivanting
around like a yearling,

11:13.407 --> 11:16.207
She's apt to drop from
exhaustion or worse.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.344
What's more, I know for a
fact that your friend here

11:19.346 --> 11:21.346
Is dressing up as a
different pony every night

11:21.348 --> 11:23.815
So he can pretend to be cured.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.151
Well, that's quite
an accusation.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.719
But let's say
that it's true.

11:28.287 --> 11:29.187
Hypothetically.

11:29.189 --> 11:33.091
As I understand, your granny
was a famous aqua-pony...

11:33.093 --> 11:35.894
The star of the show,
once upon a time...

11:35.896 --> 11:39.164
But hasn't set so much as
a hoof in the water since.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.298
Until today.

11:40.300 --> 11:44.069
Well, then even if our tonic
were nothing more than a mixture

11:44.071 --> 11:45.336
Of apple juice
and beet leaves...

11:45.338 --> 11:46.371
Hypothetically.

11:50.776 --> 11:52.744
The fact is that
granny is happier now

11:52.746 --> 11:54.212
Than before she tried it.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.880
I guess.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.482
So, the question is...

11:57.484 --> 11:59.384
Do you really want
to be the pony

11:59.386 --> 12:01.252
Who takes all that
happiness away?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.724
I...

12:05.726 --> 12:06.891
There you are!

12:06.893 --> 12:08.259
I've been looking
all over.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.128
Did you find out
what's in the tonic?

12:14.200 --> 12:17.502
Honestly, apple bloom,
as long as it works,

12:17.504 --> 12:19.938
I don't suppose
it really matters.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.775
Well, if it doesn't
matter to you,

12:23.777 --> 12:25.877
Then it doesn't matter
to me either, sis.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.782
That's the spirit!

12:30.784 --> 12:32.217
Come back anytime!

12:35.788 --> 12:38.323
Hey granny, think you can
buck me over the water?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.225
I don't see why not.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.894
Come on, big mac,
toss her this way.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.162
Granny, wait!

12:45.164 --> 12:46.431
Whoo hoo hoo!

12:46.433 --> 12:50.068
<i>(laughing)</i>

12:50.070 --> 12:52.237
What were you saying, dear?

12:52.239 --> 12:55.406
Granny, don't you think you
should take it kinda easy?

12:55.408 --> 12:58.042
I've been taking it
easy for too long

12:58.044 --> 13:01.279
And now, thanks to that flim
flam tonic, I don't have to.

13:01.281 --> 13:05.016
Granny, do you think I could
be an aqua-pony like you?

13:05.018 --> 13:07.152
Of course you can, sapling.

13:07.154 --> 13:10.088
<i>There's nothing to</i>
<i>it but to do it.</i>

13:10.090 --> 13:12.791
Well, the ponyville
swim meet is coming up.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.092
We could enter together.

13:14.094 --> 13:16.461
<i>A legendary water</i>
<i>pony like you?</i>

13:16.463 --> 13:18.496
We'd be a cinch to win.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.399
Hmmm. I don't know.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.568
Being back in the
water is one thing,

13:23.570 --> 13:26.404
But a competition is a
pony of a different color.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.174
Oh. Ok.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.412
I don't know, granny.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.447
A swim meet sounds pretty safe.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.350
And after all, if that tonic
lets you swim in a river

13:39.352 --> 13:43.087
And a swimming hole, a pool
should be no problem at all.

13:43.089 --> 13:46.024
Well, I'll be a tart
turnover, you are right!

13:46.026 --> 13:48.226
All we need now is
more tonic!

13:53.132 --> 13:54.899
Welcome friends
and step right up!

13:54.901 --> 13:57.302
The next show starts

13:57.304 --> 14:00.438
But why not buy your tonic
now and avoid the rush?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.607

And what about all that
aqua-batic stuff we just did?

19:42.382 --> 19:45.449
I reckon sometimes you can
forget what you're capable of

19:45.451 --> 19:47.652
