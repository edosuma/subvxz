00:44.480 --> 00:45.600
Good morning.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.320
Good morning.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.880
Is something taking
your thoughts, my love?

01:01.960 --> 01:05.360
Yesterday I went to bed
happier than ever before.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.800
And then I woke up.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.840
Forgive me.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.560
You do not need to apologize.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.640
I know what you
sacrificed for me.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.360
I have everything
the king wants.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.400
Besides the queen.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.160
Is that why you married me secretly?

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
What are you doing?

01:44.520 --> 01:46.640
To protect your reputation,

01:47.800 --> 01:49.440
for the good of the crown,

01:51.320 --> 01:54.040
enough that only you
and I know the truth.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.680
Do you ever think about what you
will leave after your death?

02:16.280 --> 02:18.920
Only ashes and
fading memories...

02:22.120 --> 02:25.120
or something that will
remain for eternity?

02:26.000 --> 02:29.120
You have already created something eternal.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.640
Palace.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.720
The Empire.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.760
Yes, but at what price?

02:42.080 --> 02:44.240
I'll plant the Dauphin
in Versailles.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.240
It's time to learn what
it means to be a king.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.240
And your brother?

02:55.640 --> 02:56.840
What about him?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.480
Perhaps you should let him go.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.720
Give him freedom.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.120
Why do you say that?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.200
Sometimes

03:12.120 --> 03:14.720
not the future is on our way,

03:15.560 --> 03:17.040
but the past.

03:22.360 --> 03:26.760
No. The power that binds us is
superior to the one that divides us.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.960
I need him.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.640
And he needs me.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.760
Monsieur Marchal, sir.
Someone saw him.

04:52.920 --> 04:53.940
Where?

04:54.160 --> 04:56.520
In Paris, during the
incidents of last night.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.160
Sire,

05:00.040 --> 05:02.400
we must build on what he knows.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.440
He guessed that there was
a connection between you

05:05.680 --> 05:07.400
and prisoners in a mask.

05:09.240 --> 05:13.160
Despite his past devotion,
he became a deadly threat.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.920
Send the musketeers to search
every building, every corner.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.920
Tell them that you need to find him.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.080
I myself will search.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.360
Sire?

05:28.440 --> 05:29.960
And if he will resist?

06:23.120 --> 06:25.080
Do you think that you can
return to normal life?

06:27.680 --> 06:29.320
Yes. I would like
you to join us.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.400
I have my plans.

06:38.400 --> 06:39.760
What are your plans?

06:42.520 --> 06:43.720
Bastien...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.480
Load of muskets

06:54.720 --> 06:56.440
must leave the palace tomorrow.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.560
We attack the convoy.

07:01.840 --> 07:02.860
You are crazy?

07:03.960 --> 07:05.360
You will be killed,
like dumb lambs.

07:05.520 --> 07:08.020
But I'll have time to take a few
of the King's people with me.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.120
Musketeers!

07:16.400 --> 07:17.440
Look upstairs.

07:32.320 --> 07:33.760
We are looking for a fugitive.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.760
Marshal.
You have already met.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.200
Former head of the Royal Police.

07:41.860 --> 07:42.880
Here

07:42.920 --> 07:45.920
he has no friends.
If we find him, they will inform you.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.680
Gold coins purse

07:48.920 --> 07:50.200
for the one who finds him.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.720
And the gallows to all who help him.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.880
If you see a Protestant woman,

08:01.120 --> 08:02.400
who worked here...

08:03.560 --> 08:05.760
I advise you to deliver
her to us too.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.840
Of course.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.560
Everything is fine?

08:19.360 --> 08:21.760
Do you still believe in the
opportunity to live normally?

08:35.520 --> 08:37.120
Go down to the river.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.480
Ask at the customs.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.760
Wait.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.920
Try to take him alive.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.960
But if he starts to resist,

08:50.360 --> 08:51.800
take the necessary action.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.360
Thanks to outstanding successes

09:10.600 --> 09:13.800
of our security services, the
conspiracy of Protestant anarchists

09:13.960 --> 09:16.200
with the goal of killing
the king was uncovered.

09:16.520 --> 09:20.240
Therefore, His Majesty's
forces seized their property

09:20.400 --> 09:22.320
and imprisoned the instigators.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.160
How many?

09:25.600 --> 09:27.960
More than ten thousand
people are imprisoned.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.400
Send them to the galleys.
And pastors?

09:33.800 --> 09:36.120
Executed 17 at the moment.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.560
I want to meet the
people of France.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.720
That they saw in me
not an executioner,

09:47.880 --> 09:49.240
but a saviour.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.380
May I ask how?

09:52.920 --> 09:55.760
By thaumaturgy.
I will lay my hands on them.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.240
To those who doubt,
I will bring faith.

09:58.480 --> 10:01.360
Those who suffer are comfort.
Patients - recovery.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.280
I find the idea of a brilliant,

10:03.520 --> 10:04.680
sir.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.520
His Majesty will call

10:06.760 --> 10:08.680
people to the ceremony in the palace?

10:09.400 --> 10:11.160
No, I'll go to them.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
In Paris?

10:14.920 --> 10:18.320
Seeing my confidence in themselves,
they will answer me the same.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.840
Sire, you must think about the risks,

10:21.080 --> 10:22.100
related to it.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.360
I have already assessed all the risks,

10:24.600 --> 10:26.400
to prevent them.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.640
Are you happy with the
good news, my boy?

10:43.760 --> 10:46.200
Have you seen the Chevalier de Lorren?"
No, your highness.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.600
Is this all true?

10:48.760 --> 10:52.040
This is the official version of the events.
Why doubt?

10:52.840 --> 10:54.120
The fact is that...

10:54.600 --> 10:56.080
I'm worried about my sister.

10:56.680 --> 10:58.320
I hope she's fine.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.840
Have you seen the Chevalier?"
Forgive me, Your Highness.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
She is not on any list, she
does not risk anything.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.120
Thank you.

11:07.180 --> 11:08.200
Good,

11:08.240 --> 11:10.480
I was thinking about your future.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.440
You can no longer live at
the expense of raw sludge,

11:14.600 --> 11:15.960
you need work.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.560
With your military
career, we can

11:19.800 --> 11:23.240
enrol you in the royal guard.
I'll talk to the king.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.560
It would be an honour.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.160
I'm looking for Lorraine.
Do you know where he is?

11:30.920 --> 11:32.960
Exactly where you should
be, your highness.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.800
In prison.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.600
Sire, you've gone too far.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.400
I'm glad to see you too, princess.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.520
You not only destroyed the
lives of honest Protestants,

11:53.280 --> 11:54.760
but also arrested
my dear friend.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.520
Chevalier de Lorraine.

11:56.760 --> 11:57.840
He acted

11:58.080 --> 11:59.520
against the king's order.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.740
He showed devotion to one
of our closest friends.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.080
Rare case here.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.160
You should be more careful in words,
sister. As well as your friends.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.600
I beg you to show mercy.

12:15.960 --> 12:20.360
The Duchess and he will be sent
to Louisiana as soon as possible.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.680
He will not survive the journey.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.600
With the same success you
can execute him now.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.320
Lorren is responsible
for his actions,

12:34.560 --> 12:35.840
as well as all of us.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.560
I trusted him,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.800
he decided to betray me.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.000
And this is not the first time.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.720
Where are you going?

12:50.800 --> 12:52.600
I will join my husband.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.200
Will you stop me?

12:57.680 --> 12:58.920
You are my sister.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.240
And your house is here.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.640
No more.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.480
Wait.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.600
From the day you arrived at the palace

13:16.760 --> 13:19.280
you showed honesty and charm.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.280
Without my brother and you Versailles
would lose his brilliance.

13:25.440 --> 13:27.640
And I would have lost
part of my soul.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.000
I know that I have
lost your confidence.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.880
I would like to return him
more than anything else.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.200
You can not let her go, sire.

13:55.440 --> 13:56.720
She will be back.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.000
And I pray that she
will not return alone.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.200
Do you think we will
end our days here?

14:08.520 --> 14:12.360
I'm sure if the king thinks hard about
it, he will find a better punishment.

14:15.520 --> 14:16.680
Guard!

14:17.840 --> 14:19.240
Paper and a pen,

14:19.560 --> 14:20.640
you are welcome.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.280
Where would we be if
we were not arrested?

14:26.960 --> 14:28.760
On a ship sailing to Italy.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.340
Italy...

14:31.520 --> 14:32.560
Rome.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.200
Perfect combination

14:34.440 --> 14:36.360
vice and culture.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.840
What are you doing?

14:40.920 --> 14:44.120
I'm contacting the last
person I can count on.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.140
Pass it on

14:50.280 --> 14:52.040
Monsieur Colbert, immediately.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.400
What are we going to do in Rome?

14:57.720 --> 15:00.520
We will be happy until
the end of our days.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.200
- No.
- But why?

15:08.480 --> 15:11.320
What you described -
it's just a crazy dream.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.520
What would we do without hope?

15:39.200 --> 15:42.120
No trace of him?"
Nothing, sir.

15:42.280 --> 15:43.560
Let the search continue.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.640
Bishop, have you already been
notified of the thaumaturgy?

15:48.480 --> 15:52.120
Yes, Sire. Full Moon
is expected on Sunday.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.360
This Sunday?

15:54.760 --> 15:57.280
The moment can not
be more favourable.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.520
God's grace will accompany you.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.160
The event will go down in history.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.320
For good reasons, let's hope.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.160
Are some here sceptical?

16:08.320 --> 16:10.960
I saw a lot of
hostility in the city.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.280
People can show themselves
less gratefully than expected.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.120
In the absence of Monsieur Marshall,

16:16.360 --> 16:17.760
security is a problem.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.720
In this case, you replace it,
it's time to find a successor.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.560
It's a great honour for me,

16:25.720 --> 16:28.720
but I think that we already
have an ideal successor.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.200
Hire it.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.120
Sire, I insist..."
God will protect me.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.880
And God will show the way to people.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.520
Sorry.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.800
Some habits are difficult
to get rid of.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.480
They were looking for you here.
- I know.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.880
Why are they afraid of you?"
They see me as a threat.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.180
This is true?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.200
We need your help.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.040
In what?

17:17.800 --> 17:19.240
Stop the king.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.079
To make him end our misery.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.640
You're wasting your time.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.080
If you stand in his way...

17:32.480 --> 17:33.520
he will crush you.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.840
Listen,

17:35.640 --> 17:38.800
we are in a rage, we do not
have the experience, but if you

17:39.280 --> 17:40.640
stand on our side,

17:40.880 --> 17:43.320
everything will change.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.400
He sent his men to
pursue you like a dog.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.000
Do you not feel
anger towards him?

17:52.880 --> 17:55.840
You already helped us.
Why not help again?

17:57.800 --> 18:01.720
Because I saw more blood than
anyone in my whole life.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.960
So you are afraid.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.120
I killed, disfigured,

18:10.120 --> 18:12.360
imprisoned, tortured and executed.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.800
Some were guilty.
Others - less.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.020
I was destroying

18:17.160 --> 18:18.600
families.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.520
I deprived the children of their father.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.000
My hands are bloody.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.200
It's time to wash it off.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.400
Then do the right thing.

18:37.760 --> 18:39.280
Otherwise you will surrender to us.

18:40.600 --> 18:42.720
And, refusing us,

18:43.280 --> 18:44.960
you renounce justice.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.800
You will not attend the council?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.080
To me it is a little bad.

19:07.800 --> 19:09.640
Tell His Majesty

19:09.880 --> 19:11.240
My apologies.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.320
It seems that you should be congratulated.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.580
With what?

19:18.960 --> 19:21.680
For a brave battle

19:21.920 --> 19:23.320
with Protestant killers.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.440
I obeyed my king.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.140
You are welcome,

19:30.240 --> 19:31.440
give it to him.

19:32.680 --> 19:33.760
Evaluation of benefits,

19:34.000 --> 19:36.680
which will bring him a
marriage with the infant.

19:38.680 --> 19:41.560
I hope you will soon recover.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.280
Yes...

19:44.400 --> 19:46.960
except that in order
to do justice.

19:48.760 --> 19:49.800
Have a nice day.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.440
To you too.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.480
What are you reading? Bad romance?

20:22.760 --> 20:23.920
Far from it.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.480
The biggest pessimist in the world:
La Rochefoucauld.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.360
Can a person say with certainty
what he will want in the future,

20:31.520 --> 20:33.800
if he is not able to
understand what he wants now?"

20:35.840 --> 20:38.160
It sounds pretty wise.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.680
Did my brother send you?"
- No, I'm here on my own initiative.

20:51.200 --> 20:52.440
What for?

20:55.080 --> 20:56.720
To bring you home.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.040
My brother would be delighted.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.280
It's not for him, but for me.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.440
For Chevalier's sake.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.020
And for you.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.760
I'm glad to see you.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.520
They say you are smart and courteous,

21:34.760 --> 21:37.600
but too busy hunting
for girls and foxes.

21:37.960 --> 21:38.960
- I...
- Do not worry.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.000
I was the same at your age.

21:44.760 --> 21:48.600
He became a handsome young
man, with a royal look.

21:48.920 --> 21:50.000
Do not you agree, madam?

21:50.160 --> 21:52.240
He's a copy of his father.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.240
I'm very pleased to meet you.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.040
I hope we will be friends.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.840
You did not swallow
the tongue, I hope?

22:01.360 --> 22:02.520
No, Sire.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.640
Sire? You must call me father.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.560
Yes, father.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.680
Do you have an assignment for me?

22:11.320 --> 22:14.320
I just want to spend time with
you, like father and son.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.120
And I think it's time
to learn something.

22:18.640 --> 22:22.000
You will not become a good king unless
you know how the subjects live.

22:24.320 --> 22:26.560
Sire, you remember Guillaume.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.640
Of course, you saved my
brother at the front

22:32.280 --> 22:33.600
and left the family

22:33.840 --> 22:37.480
and things to live in Versailles.
I hope you do not suffer from this.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.600
It's worth it if I can
serve His Majesty.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.320
This is my son, the
future of France.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.640
Entering my service, you vowed
to protect him and my family

22:49.800 --> 22:51.080
from any danger.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.320
Even if you have to
sacrifice your own life.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.560
Are you ready to do this?

22:55.720 --> 22:58.880
Dying, doing his duty,
it would be an honour.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.400
The first rule of the king:

23:04.120 --> 23:06.960
surround yourself with
people who deserve trust.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.720
Do you really want to
end your days here?

23:16.080 --> 23:19.680
Sad and lonely, alone
with your memories?

23:22.120 --> 23:24.080
Chevalier wants me to come back?

23:27.960 --> 23:28.980
He needs you.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.480
He's in jail.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.680
Captured unawares when
drinking church wine?

23:37.640 --> 23:41.240
He risked his life, defending the
castle of the Duchess d'Angers,

23:41.480 --> 23:42.600
just imagine.

23:46.880 --> 23:48.720
I did not know that he was so brave.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.160
He has changed.

23:57.160 --> 23:59.200
Maybe it's time for
you to change too.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.880
I will return to Versailles,

24:06.040 --> 24:08.640
and my brother will treat
me like a dog again?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.440
He is such a.

24:11.640 --> 24:12.920
You know it.

24:14.800 --> 24:15.800
He does his duty,

24:16.040 --> 24:17.240
he is a king.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.320
He will always be like this.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.160
This does not mean,

24:26.400 --> 24:27.760
that he does not love you.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.800
We are Family,

24:37.400 --> 24:38.480
Philip.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.520
And families should stick together.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.440
The king invites the sick and the
infirm to the laying on of the hand.

25:10.480 --> 25:11.600
What?

25:15.760 --> 25:16.760
Who does he think he is?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.120
A Saviour?

25:20.600 --> 25:23.320
Look at them.
How can they believe this?

25:23.840 --> 25:24.840
Let's go to.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.200
We have a job.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.240
Wait a minute.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.120
Do not you see?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.040
What?

25:37.000 --> 25:38.520
Perhaps this is our chance.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.720
For what?

25:40.960 --> 25:42.320
Kill the king.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.880
Your Highness.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
Madame.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.520
If I did not know, I would have
thought that you were avoiding me.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.600
Of course not.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.960
I thought we should
discuss the wedding.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.680
As soon as possible.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.880
Understand, His Majesty
has many things to do,

26:16.120 --> 26:17.240
requiring his attention.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.720
And I'm one of those things.
- Of course.

26:21.640 --> 26:24.800
And even if it is not, I'm
sure you do not lack fans.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.240
Any Prince or King of Europe

26:27.480 --> 26:29.440
would see in you an ideal wife.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.720
I do not care about
these princes or kings.

26:34.840 --> 26:35.920
I'm interested in

26:36.160 --> 26:37.600
the king of France.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.500
Like all of us,

26:39.840 --> 26:40.920
Your Highness.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.160
Excuse me.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.260
It can not be reproached
for lack of confidence.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.480
You could send her
back to Portugal

26:54.640 --> 26:57.120
and tell her father that you
will give an answer in a year.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.840
Keep her here, then
encourage him...

27:01.000 --> 27:03.200
Believe that she will soon become a queen.
- Yes.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.040
- No, this will not happen.

27:09.320 --> 27:10.400
Sire?

27:14.160 --> 27:16.600
I do not want to see
you suffer any more.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.040
There is only one way to
put an end to rumours.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.320
I see that nothing has changed.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.720
The Royal Family.

27:48.320 --> 27:49.960
God, he married her!

28:04.840 --> 28:08.640
Do not forget to show equally
modesty and confidence.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.080
Congratulations.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.400
Remind me, never play
cards against you.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.760
My dear Infanta, I would like
to introduce you to my son.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.280
It's a great honour for
me, your Highness.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.640
I see you inherited the exterior

28:30.880 --> 28:32.080
your father.

28:33.400 --> 28:36.400
Let's hope that you did
not inherit his manner.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.840
You must get to know each other better.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.640
I already know a lot of people.

28:42.360 --> 28:45.520
Of course, but none of them will
become the future king of France.

28:58.200 --> 28:59.680
Stables and feeds:

29:00.640 --> 29:01.880
one million.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.760
Linen:

29:05.680 --> 29:07.040
200 000.

29:08.200 --> 29:09.440
Wine:

29:09.680 --> 29:10.920
900,000.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.960
Games:

29:13.440 --> 29:14.760
two million.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.760
This is what you owe to Versailles.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.160
But we are celebrating now.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.960
That's why I set you free.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.560
from all your debts.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.480
Let's drink and have fun.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.040
But...

29:33.880 --> 29:37.240
do not forget those who are
less fortunate than us.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.360
Those who go to the front for our sake,

29:40.840 --> 29:42.800
who ploughs on our fields

29:43.200 --> 29:44.720
and bakes our bread.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.600
We live together,
we suffer together.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.460
We love

29:52.600 --> 29:53.760
together.

29:56.960 --> 30:00.440
On Sunday, a great healing
ceremony will take place,

30:01.360 --> 30:04.720
during which I will bless
the sick and needy.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.080
We will honour the fact,

30:07.320 --> 30:08.640
that we are not just a nation.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.360
We are Family.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.440
For the King!

30:17.840 --> 30:19.080
For the King!

30:34.120 --> 30:36.000
I was hoping to see
you here tonight.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.640
Good evening, madam.

30:41.280 --> 30:44.120
I would prefer that
you call me sister.

30:46.240 --> 30:47.760
Last night we got married.

30:50.520 --> 30:51.680
So, then, is she a queen?

30:54.560 --> 30:56.120
No, I'm the king's wife.

31:02.600 --> 31:03.600
Congratulations.

31:06.920 --> 31:08.560
You showed courage,

31:09.280 --> 31:10.400
I must admit.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.560
Can we talk privately?

31:25.400 --> 31:27.840
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.960
Welcome to the family.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.240
One batch of cards?

31:34.640 --> 31:35.800
If you want to.

31:36.440 --> 31:39.320
- I warn: I cheat.
- I also.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.880
I'm not back for you, Louis.
- No?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.480
I'm here only for myself.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.840
I need you to be with me.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.720
Too much divides us.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.680
I have always supported you.
And what did I get in return?

32:07.160 --> 32:08.840
And what do you want?

32:09.320 --> 32:10.440
Lorraine?

32:10.840 --> 32:12.600
Release him if you want.

32:19.920 --> 32:21.320
I saved your life.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.840
How?

32:22.900 --> 32:25.635
I found our father and did
not allow the Vatican to

32:25.660 --> 32:28.604
destroy us. If it was not for
me, you would not be here.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.060
You did not save me.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.600
You saved us.

32:32.840 --> 32:34.320
And you're still my brother.

32:35.080 --> 32:36.360
And I'm still the king.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.320
Is not it?

32:38.840 --> 32:40.120
Yes, you are still a king.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.880
And you will be behind my back?

32:58.000 --> 33:00.200
Let's go, let's get out of here.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.760
I will not leave without her.
- No.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.120
You have already helped me a lot.

33:09.280 --> 33:10.800
I'll come back for you.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.080
- I promise.
- Leave!

33:36.920 --> 33:38.080
Well...

33:42.120 --> 33:43.240
how are you?

33:44.960 --> 33:46.480
Guess.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.280
I thought, you need
to pamper yourself.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.520
Maybe after the bath?

33:57.200 --> 33:58.240
Wait.

33:59.200 --> 34:02.600
Do you really think that you can
continue from the place where we stayed?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.840
I thought you'd be grateful.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.840
I've done you a favour.
No, you've done yourself a favour.

34:13.840 --> 34:14.900
And then what?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.020
Sexual services?

34:16.159 --> 34:17.239
Am I now your whore?

34:18.920 --> 34:21.060
I try to do the right thing,
but you thank me so much?

34:21.120 --> 34:23.080
Do you really want to
do the right thing?

34:23.480 --> 34:27.000
There are a lot of innocent people
in prison. Why not save them?

34:28.800 --> 34:29.880
Listen...

34:31.159 --> 34:33.000
you can not do anything
for the Dolphin.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.600
You have to try and forget it.

34:39.760 --> 34:40.800
AND...

34:41.280 --> 34:43.120
enjoy what we have.

34:47.239 --> 34:48.760
Maybe it suits you.

34:49.679 --> 34:50.920
But not to me.

35:05.040 --> 35:06.600
I brought you some food.

35:08.400 --> 35:09.600
Fresh fruits.

35:10.680 --> 35:13.080
It kept my mother in shape
until 95 years old.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.560
Oh, I think the time for
fresh fruit has passed.

35:23.560 --> 35:24.880
The king wants to see you.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.560
I will not accept it.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.560
You insult him.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.720
Do you know what is written
on my coat of arms?

35:43.360 --> 35:44.560
It is written there:

35:44.760 --> 35:46.960
For the King's sake - often.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.240
For the sake of the motherland - always.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.320
Motherland is above the king.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.720
No one respects his
majesty more than I do.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.920
But the king has changed.

36:07.000 --> 36:11.000
From now on he instils
more fear than love.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.600
He's worried about you.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.120
And I repeat:

36:19.040 --> 36:20.600
I will not accept it.
But, Colbert..."

36:21.320 --> 36:23.000
I gave him my life.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.280
I will not give him my death.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.780
All my life I've been
waiting for this moment.

36:43.320 --> 36:45.080
I should not fail.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.120
You will not fail.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.120
You believe in me?

36:58.920 --> 37:00.280
More than ever.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.720
Sire, I would have
neglected my duties,

37:08.880 --> 37:11.520
if it were not recommended
to cancel the ceremony.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.880
I would have neglected
my own if I had obeyed.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.960
I will not disappoint my people.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.680
And I'm not a coward.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.840
To go to Paris means to
enter the lion's den.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.080
I beg you,

37:22.120 --> 37:23.680
do not do this.

37:23.840 --> 37:25.040
So it is necessary.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.200
But the Dauphin will remain here.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.160
Search all houses

37:34.400 --> 37:37.040
before the arrival of the king,
make sure that no one is armed.

37:37.280 --> 37:40.720
Put a person on every street
corner and in case of doubt,

37:40.960 --> 37:42.840
let him shoot. And do not forget:

37:43.080 --> 37:45.000
The life of the king is in your hands.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.480
Be kind, open.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.360
You are welcome.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.080
Do not stop under any pretext.

38:44.600 --> 38:48.120
You will go to Amiens, and from there
on horseback will gallop to Holland.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.440
And where are you going?

38:54.720 --> 38:55.760
Good try.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.000
- Return it to the camera.
- No.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.200
Release her.

39:05.920 --> 39:07.280
But, Your Highness..."

39:07.560 --> 39:09.480
Let her go.
But His Majesty..."

39:10.760 --> 39:13.600
You talked too much today.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.640
You are a good person.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.240
Do not forget this ever.
Thank you...

40:03.920 --> 40:05.120
Come on.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.760
Let's go and see how my brother
sets himself up as God.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.000
The king will defend, his
people have an order

40:30.240 --> 40:31.800
shoot immediately.
So no misses.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.220
At my signal...

40:36.480 --> 40:38.440
shoot the guards and musketeers.

40:46.280 --> 40:47.300
My goal...

40:48.240 --> 40:49.440
king.

40:53.840 --> 40:54.900
You do not stand a chance.

40:57.880 --> 41:01.000
You will be shattered
before you shoot.

41:03.640 --> 41:06.320
If the prospect of
death scares you...

41:07.400 --> 41:08.760
leave now.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.560
But if you have the courage

41:12.720 --> 41:16.080
risking their lives in the
name of freedom and justice,

41:16.240 --> 41:17.280
stay.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.840
It is better to die with glory,

41:21.880 --> 41:24.520
than to live in
poverty, in my opinion.

41:26.880 --> 41:28.440
You are with us

41:29.000 --> 41:30.080
or not?

41:32.080 --> 41:34.000
I'm leaving forever.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.420
Stop it.

41:38.920 --> 41:39.920
Let him go.

41:40.720 --> 41:42.120
The risk is too great.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.760
I know him, I trust him.

41:45.840 --> 41:46.840
Let him go.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.160
Do not do this.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.040
You will die.

42:13.120 --> 42:15.440
And the hopes of your
people will die with you.

42:57.840 --> 43:00.120
Are not you going to the thaumaturgy?"
- No.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.120
Why?

43:06.840 --> 43:08.720
I have something to tell you.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.400
Be nice...

43:14.560 --> 43:16.560
to transfer these documents to the king?

43:21.840 --> 43:22.960
My farewell gift.

43:28.960 --> 43:32.640
I hope you do not expect to
talk to me about finances.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.320
Colbert...

43:44.160 --> 43:45.760
we know each other

43:46.000 --> 43:47.240
for many years.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.400
And despite...

43:51.240 --> 43:52.720
our differences...

43:54.560 --> 43:57.280
I admire you more
than anyone else.

44:01.840 --> 44:04.440
You gave your life to the King

44:04.840 --> 44:06.000
and France.

44:13.440 --> 44:16.240
And if we had not been
so busy with work,

44:18.760 --> 44:21.040
I would like us to be friends.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.440
Colbert?

45:49.920 --> 45:51.160
King!

45:54.680 --> 45:55.920
King!

46:01.520 --> 46:02.840
King!

46:04.080 --> 46:05.280
King!

46:43.880 --> 46:44.900
Where have you been?

46:44.960 --> 46:46.720
I saved the young lady

46:46.960 --> 46:49.720
from the claws of the dragon.
Nothing unusual.

46:55.480 --> 46:58.520
Have you inspected
houses, benches, roofs?

46:58.680 --> 46:59.880
Yes, Monsieur.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.100
King!

47:39.560 --> 47:41.400
Let the ceremony begin!

47:50.720 --> 47:51.760
Come here.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.080
The king touches you...

48:08.240 --> 48:09.720
God heals you.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.800
The King touches
you, God heals you.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.960
The king touches you...

48:40.720 --> 48:42.120
God heals you.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.880
The king touches you...

49:02.440 --> 49:03.880
God heals you.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.160
The king touches you...

49:20.720 --> 49:22.120
God heals you.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
Defend the King!

49:38.160 --> 49:39.280
This way, sir.

49:49.880 --> 49:50.900
Jeanne!

50:07.400 --> 50:08.480
Sorry...

50:27.200 --> 50:28.260
This way, sir.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.720
At that moment, I realized
that I could lose you.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.600
I could not allow this.

51:32.120 --> 51:33.140
Thank you.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.280
Who would have thought
that this little girl

51:37.800 --> 51:39.800
will one day save the king's life?

51:40.760 --> 51:44.080
You did not save the king.
You saved your brother.

51:45.760 --> 51:47.760
There will always be
those who want my death.

51:48.160 --> 51:49.200
I know.

51:50.680 --> 51:51.800
You are the king.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.680
I could not be it.

51:56.040 --> 51:57.160
No, Louis.

51:57.880 --> 52:00.320
You were king even
before your birth.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.960
I hated you because of that.

52:04.840 --> 52:06.360
I was jealous.

52:07.200 --> 52:11.400
You've always been in the spotlight,
and I'm a necessary addition.

52:12.880 --> 52:13.920
And now?

52:18.440 --> 52:20.160
I believe that I have matured.

52:21.600 --> 52:23.480
I see you as you are.

52:24.800 --> 52:28.160
And your duties exceed
all human capabilities.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.360
How can you be jealous...

52:32.400 --> 52:34.280
the one I respect?

52:42.520 --> 52:43.840
Two brothers...

52:46.880 --> 52:48.880
We started this life together.

52:49.800 --> 52:51.640
We must finish it together.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.880
You're not going to get
dressed like a scarecrow.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.200
Maybe we will stop arguing?

53:30.360 --> 53:31.640
Sorry I am...

53:31.960 --> 53:33.160
I'm scared.

53:33.480 --> 53:34.720
Just.

53:36.840 --> 53:38.000
Me too.

53:40.600 --> 53:41.680
Nevertheless...

53:43.760 --> 53:45.320
Maybe we need...

53:48.000 --> 53:49.080
Yes.

53:49.960 --> 53:51.240
Maybe we need...

53:53.760 --> 53:55.640
I want you to say the first.

53:56.680 --> 53:57.800
What?

54:00.560 --> 54:02.000
What you never said.

54:07.600 --> 54:09.280
I'll tell you if you say so.

54:11.280 --> 54:12.400
I agree.

54:22.160 --> 54:23.160
I...

54:26.200 --> 54:27.200
I...

54:29.600 --> 54:30.760
... I love...

54:33.120 --> 54:34.240
... I love...

54:35.640 --> 54:36.760
...you.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.160
...you.

54:58.040 --> 55:00.440
- We just...
I know what you did.

55:04.880 --> 55:07.160
There is always room for
you in my heart, Lizelott.

55:11.520 --> 55:15.000
Calm down, I took
my fate long ago.

55:19.560 --> 55:21.720
I'm married to two
men whom I love.

55:27.880 --> 55:30.880
Let's go, they are waiting
for us in the salon.

55:31.880 --> 55:33.840
If you do not have other plans.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.400
Plans?

55:39.000 --> 55:40.240
No plans.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.040
Open your eyes.

56:10.840 --> 56:13.480
One day all this
will belong to you.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.640
Glory, power.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.040
And the duties that
accompany them.

56:23.960 --> 56:25.440
Will I have enough strength?

56:25.720 --> 56:26.960
Courage?

56:27.720 --> 56:28.920
Insight?"

56:30.480 --> 56:31.680
Who am I?"

56:34.800 --> 56:36.680
Are you ready to shed tears?"
- Yes.

56:38.280 --> 56:39.560
And blood?

56:39.920 --> 56:41.120
I think yes.

56:42.800 --> 56:46.400
The path that awaits you will
be full of tears and blood.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.400
Not only your enemies,

56:50.040 --> 56:51.280
but also yours.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.640
Your people.

56:55.520 --> 56:56.840
Your loved ones.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.240
You will make mistakes,

57:03.560 --> 57:06.440
Get lost and follow bad advice.

57:07.240 --> 57:08.960
You will lose your innocence,

57:09.480 --> 57:13.080
you will find out that your best
friend may be your worst enemy.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.000
But trust

57:18.040 --> 57:20.480
first of all to himself,
and not to another.

57:25.480 --> 57:27.080
Because you're the king.

57:28.160 --> 57:29.680
Elected by God.

57:45.120 --> 57:47.200
Always look to the future.

57:49.920 --> 57:53.280
There, where obstacles and
enemies are waiting for you.

57:56.240 --> 57:58.040
But you can not look into the future,

57:59.240 --> 58:01.360
until you defeat the past.

58:03.080 --> 58:04.200
Then

58:04.440 --> 58:05.800
you will be free.

58:10.160 --> 58:11.480
Only then

58:13.760 --> 58:15.400
you will attain immortality.
