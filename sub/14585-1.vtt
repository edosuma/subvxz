02:24.845 --> 02:26.245
Come in.

02:26.887 --> 02:30.387
William Kessel...
The producer of this motion picture...

02:31.747 --> 02:33.547
...has a question for you.

02:33.597 --> 02:35.397
Do you believe in ghosts?

02:35.624 --> 02:37.124
Some people believe in them.

02:37.322 --> 02:38.722
Others do not.

02:38.985 --> 02:40.605
Personally I do.

02:41.345 --> 02:43.745
And I feel sure that when you leave this theatre...

02:44.388 --> 02:46.488
...you too will believe in ghosts.

02:47.513 --> 02:49.613
Uh...no more dictation today.

02:50.835 --> 02:54.335
Now when you came in...
you were given a special ghost viewer...

02:54.513 --> 02:55.913
...like this.

02:57.389 --> 02:58.609
And here's how it works.

02:58.996 --> 03:01.796
Would you please change the color of the screen?

03:02.260 --> 03:03.460
Thank you.

03:03.525 --> 03:08.225
You must only use it, when the screen
changes to this kind of a blueish color.

03:09.585 --> 03:13.585
...then you raise the viewer to your eyes,
and you look at the screen through it.

03:13.779 --> 03:19.079
If you believe in ghosts,
you look through the red part of the viewer.

03:20.591 --> 03:24.491
If you do not believe in ghosts,
you look throught the blue part.

03:25.903 --> 03:27.723
Would you please change the color again?

03:28.765 --> 03:30.165
Thank you.

03:30.226 --> 03:32.826
Now when the screen resumes it's normal color...

03:32.911 --> 03:33.891
...like this...

03:33.892 --> 03:39.611
....remove the viewer from in front of your eyes...
until the next time the screen becomes blue.

03:40.111 --> 03:41.631
Oh.  One more thing.

03:41.862 --> 03:47.662
If someone sits down next to you, during the picture...
it would be helpful... if you would show him or her...

03:48.064 --> 03:50.164
...how the viewer should be used.

03:50.419 --> 03:53.269
And remember...if you
believe in ghosts...

03:53.270 --> 03:54.619
....look through the red part.

03:56.025 --> 03:59.925
If you don't believe in ghosts...
look throught the blue.

04:02.547 --> 04:03.967
Happy haunting.

04:04.057 --> 04:05.877
Good bye for now.

04:06.808 --> 04:08.208
Shall we go?

04:18.060 --> 04:22.088
The La Brea tar pits became
traps for all kinds of animals.

04:22.300 --> 04:27.067
They would either wonder out on the tar
or be driven into it by their enemies.

04:27.272 --> 04:30.970
The tar would trap them and slowly kill them.

04:31.175 --> 04:35.203
Now, some of you are going to ask:
How did birds get into the pit?

04:36.115 --> 04:40.985
The Vultures and condors fed on whatever
had the misfortune to be trapped.

04:41.186 --> 04:44.384
And sometimes the birds themselves
got caught in the tar...

04:44.591 --> 04:46.991
... And were pulled down to thier death.

04:47.862 --> 04:53.199
If any of you would like to see where
these birds and animals came from...

04:53.401 --> 04:56.371
... the pits are in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles.

04:56.570 --> 04:59.062
Go over there sometime and try to imagine...

04:59.274 --> 05:04.144
... what it was like 40,000 years ago,
when monsters like these...

05:04.347 --> 05:08.807
... wandered around, where now
expensive cars roam.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.543
Why did huge beasts...

05:11.755 --> 05:15.156
...so much more powerful than man...

05:15.659 --> 05:18.094
... disappeared from the face
of Earth, while man...

05:18.295 --> 05:21.197
... a relatively puny thing, survived?

05:21.271 --> 05:22.391
Psst.

05:24.570 --> 05:27.470
Excuse me.  Just a moment.

05:31.944 --> 05:35.380
- What's the trouble, Mr. Van Allen?
- You're wife's on the phone.

05:35.582 --> 05:38.517
But I'm lecturing.
I told her that.

05:39.019 --> 05:41.886
Will you take over for me, Ben?
Yes, of course.

05:42.090 --> 05:44.820
Oh, Cy... where are you?

05:45.026 --> 05:48.792
Explaining how man survived the Pleistocene Age.

05:50.164 --> 05:51.723
How did he?

05:52.267 --> 05:53.666
And why?

06:05.449 --> 06:06.847
Hello honey.  What's the trouble?

06:07.051 --> 06:10.384
The moving men are here, and they're
taking the furniture away, again.

06:12.189 --> 06:15.215
Won't they wait?
No, they won't wait.

06:15.427 --> 06:19.761
Not even til tomorrow?
The payments are three months overdue now.

06:19.965 --> 06:25.302
Three months? I distinctly remember...
Somehow you didn't make the payments, Cy...

06:25.505 --> 06:29.340
...But if we can make them now,
plus a month in advance....

06:29.810 --> 06:31.004
Let's do that.

06:31.210 --> 06:34.943
How much money do we have in the bank?
About 2 dollars.

06:35.049 --> 06:37.580
Hmm.  I get paid soon.

06:37.584 --> 06:41.082
You don't get paid for almost a month,
and we owe it all anyway.

06:41.089 --> 06:44.321
Do you suppose Mr. Van Allen...?
- No.

06:44.526 --> 06:47.586
Mr. Van Allen doesn't
make much more than I do...

06:47.797 --> 06:50.265
... And he's got three children.

06:50.279 --> 06:53.131
Oh!   What's the matter?
Nothing.

06:53.336 --> 06:57.898
Good thing we own the mattresses.
Did you get Buck a birthday present?

06:58.141 --> 07:02.238
Ah, Yeah, yeah.
Don't forget to bring it.  Bye.

07:02.446 --> 07:03.709
Bye honey.

07:11.589 --> 07:14.457
Why do they always take our furniture?

07:15.194 --> 07:18.994
Because your father is a wonderful
man....just forgetful.

07:19.199 --> 07:23.033
Like me?
Like you, Buck.  Sometimes.

07:32.346 --> 07:36.647
Well the rats and the prends are just useful anyway.
Socks and things.

07:37.152 --> 07:38.813
You gave him that one?

07:39.221 --> 07:41.849
Oh there's nothing wrong with ghost stories, daddy.

07:42.058 --> 07:46.688
Unless that's all you read.
He's got every spooky book ever printed.

07:53.513 --> 07:55.513
Ow!  Hey!

07:55.539 --> 07:57.940
Do you believe in ghosts, Buck?
Sure.

07:58.143 --> 08:01.044
You want some cake?
Cake?

08:01.312 --> 08:02.609
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.877
No no no.  You've got to make a wish first.
I already have.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.752
Well, how will anybody know if
your wish comes true, if you don't wish out loud?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.689
Suppose I don't want to anyone to know.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.059
Then you wished for something bad.
I have not, Medea.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.826
Well, If you can't wish out loud,
then there must be something wrong with it.

08:22.036 --> 08:25.130
Don't you want us to know what you're wish is, darling?

08:27.041 --> 08:32.378
I wished we had a house with furniture,
that nobody could take away from us.

09:06.452 --> 09:09.217
Mr. Cyrus Zorba?

09:11.458 --> 09:13.551
A telegram for you.

09:39.090 --> 09:41.718
"With regards to matter of great importance to you...

09:41.925 --> 09:46.454
... you are requested to present yourself
in the office of attorney Benjamin Rush...

09:46.664 --> 09:50.794
... tomorrow morning at 10 oclock.
Signed, Benjamin Rush"

09:51.003 --> 09:53.801
Who?
Benjamin Rush, attorney.

09:54.006 --> 09:57.033
Well it's not anybody we owe.
At least I don't think so.

09:57.242 --> 10:00.212
Could be the lawyer from a collection agency.

10:00.412 --> 10:02.347
Oh.  Could be.
What are you going to do?

10:02.548 --> 10:05.711
Go. What else?
Suppose you just run away?

10:05.919 --> 10:08.786
Why run away, before you find
out what's chasing you?

10:08.989 --> 10:12.254
Well, I read about a man waited to find out...

10:12.460 --> 10:15.054
... But he never did, because it ate him.

10:16.598 --> 10:19.567
Benjamin Rush, attorney at law.

10:19.768 --> 10:21.964
Ooh, he's in the Petro building.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.099
You have'nt done anything you
could be arrested for, have you daddy?

10:26.309 --> 10:27.640
No.

10:29.645 --> 10:31.341
Not lately.

10:40.858 --> 10:44.624
So, you inherit the house,
which is the bulk of the estate.

10:45.129 --> 10:46.995
- Furnished?
- Ah, yes.

10:47.198 --> 10:50.635
It's pretty old-fashioned, but is furniture.

10:50.836 --> 10:53.168
Is Buck pshycic or something?
Ma'am?

10:54.106 --> 10:58.772
Our ten year old son, Buck.
His birthday wish was for a house with furniture.

10:58.978 --> 11:02.004
Yeah.
What sort of a house is it?

11:02.216 --> 11:04.741
I affraid you're gonna be
disappointed, Mr Zorba.

11:04.952 --> 11:09.082
It's one of those sprawling old
mansions they built 50 years ago.

11:09.291 --> 11:12.522
Well, that's better than a third
mortgage and no furniture.

11:12.728 --> 11:15.721
Well, don't decide to move in until you've seen it.

11:15.931 --> 11:18.264
Here's the key and the address.

11:19.501 --> 11:21.367
This is really strange.

11:21.571 --> 11:26.271
I thought my uncle  died
10, 12 years ago in India or someplace.

11:26.476 --> 11:28.968
No.  He died here last week.

11:29.179 --> 11:33.309
Everything about your uncle was strange.
Including his will.

11:33.517 --> 11:36.745
Is that the rich uncle you used to
talk about before we got married?

11:36.769 --> 11:40.221
Uh huh.  And he's been here,
in Los Angeles, all these years...

11:41.227 --> 11:42.921
... And didn't let me know?

11:43.129 --> 11:45.859
Well, he wanted the world
to think he was dead.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.191
He left you this, too.

11:59.213 --> 12:01.204
What is it?
I don't know.

12:01.649 --> 12:06.087
Is this all?  The house and the
package?   No other...

12:06.287 --> 12:11.488
Well there's no money, if that's what you mean, Ma'am.
Dr. Zorba must have been quite wealthy, at one time.

12:11.693 --> 12:14.253
Apparently, he spent it all on his experiments.

12:14.464 --> 12:18.093
I seem to remember he was fooling around with the occult.

12:18.301 --> 12:21.737
Spirits from the other world.
Ghosts.

12:21.939 --> 12:25.397
Dr. Zorba  collected ghosts
from all over the world.

12:25.609 --> 12:27.008
You inherit them, too.

12:31.116 --> 12:32.640
Come on.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.345
They go with the house.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.389
I'll get a notary.

12:46.467 --> 12:49.300
Cy, this is too much.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.994
A mysterious uncle rising from the grave...

12:52.206 --> 12:55.973
... The old mansion, complete with ghosts.
Is it a gag?

12:56.176 --> 12:59.306
I did have an uncle named Plato Zorba.

12:59.547 --> 13:02.312
And here's his last will and testament.

13:02.518 --> 13:07.387
I want to see what's in the package?
Wouldn't it be lovely if it was just full of stocks or bonds.

13:07.590 --> 13:10.115
Or just plain money.
Yeah.

13:10.327 --> 13:14.058
Think we ought to open it?
Well, he said it was yours.

13:19.871 --> 13:22.705
Suppose it has to do with those experiments.

13:22.907 --> 13:27.571
You know.  You open the box and
all that trouble comes out.

13:27.779 --> 13:29.076
Pandora.

13:29.281 --> 13:32.944
It's probably a hand painted Christmas tie.
Open it.

13:51.306 --> 13:52.830
You open it.

15:06.590 --> 15:09.754
Oh, hi.
Hello.  Are you Buck?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.200
Yeah.

15:11.863 --> 15:14.388
I'm Ben Rush.
You're the lawyer.

15:15.467 --> 15:16.867
Uh Hm.  Are you all moved in?

15:17.068 --> 15:20.869
Wasn't anything to move, except us.
It's a great house.

15:21.073 --> 15:23.201
Furniture all over....books.

15:23.409 --> 15:27.106
There's a lot of it I haven't even seen yet.
It's got ghosts.

15:27.314 --> 15:29.339
So I hear.
Know about em'?

15:29.549 --> 15:32.575
Well, I've heard a lot about em'.
You ever seen one?

15:32.787 --> 15:34.721
No.  Is your father home?

15:34.922 --> 15:38.586
He will be soon.  We got a witch too.
A live one?

15:38.793 --> 15:41.557
Go ring the bell.
She'll come to the door.

15:49.371 --> 15:52.830
Oh, shucks.
What did you have to open the door for?

15:53.044 --> 15:54.977
Couoldn't you wait for the witch?

15:55.179 --> 15:58.637
You better stop calling her that,
or she'll cut your tongue out.

15:58.849 --> 16:01.283
Hi, i'm Medea Zorba.
Hi.

16:01.485 --> 16:03.113
Won't you come in?

16:08.427 --> 16:11.328
I told you.  She's even got a broom.

16:15.367 --> 16:18.870
I see what you mean.
You must be Ben Rush, the lawyer.

16:18.907 --> 16:19.719
Um hmm.

16:21.620 --> 16:24.869
Mmm.  No skates.  We own this house.
Or do we?

16:25.079 --> 16:28.447
It's your house.
Who's boss around here?

16:28.649 --> 16:33.246
In the "no skates" department, I am.
Yeah, that's what I thought.

16:42.064 --> 16:44.157
Was the my father's uncle?

16:44.173 --> 16:45.093
Um hm.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.228
He was a fine looking man.

16:47.637 --> 16:49.868
I never saw him like that.

16:50.073 --> 16:53.874
By the time I met him, they'd almost
completely destroyed him.

16:54.078 --> 16:55.067
They?

16:55.513 --> 16:57.003
His ghosts.

16:58.149 --> 17:02.677
Oh, Benjamin Rush, attorney at law.
Living in the twentieth century?

17:02.888 --> 17:05.880
Plato Zorba, scientist, same century.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.059
Collected ghosts.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.727
You're not serious?

17:10.997 --> 17:15.491
I didn't believe in them any more than you do,
until I'd known him a while.

17:15.703 --> 17:19.263
You can take my word for him.
There are ghosts in this house.

17:19.473 --> 17:23.308
We're standing here talking as if you
thought we were in the Middle Ages.

17:25.146 --> 17:27.240
But if you had seen him as I did...

17:28.049 --> 17:29.677
...back broken...

17:30.118 --> 17:32.747
...face torn to shreds...

17:32.954 --> 17:34.855
... lips ripped away...

17:36.058 --> 17:39.187
You really think we inherited a haunted house?

17:40.029 --> 17:42.658
I wish your family hadn't moved in.

17:46.070 --> 17:47.768
Oh, hello, Mr. Rush.
Hi.

17:47.772 --> 17:48.586
Hi, honey.

17:49.687 --> 17:53.003
Here are the rest of those papers,
all signed and notarized.

17:53.311 --> 17:57.708
But I... What about the taxes.
The insurance.  This housekeeper?

17:57.817 --> 18:00.479
Why don't we ask Mr. Rush to stay for supper?

18:00.686 --> 18:03.985
Well I'd love to.
Even if you do call me Mr. Rush.

18:04.191 --> 18:06.454
I'll tell mother... Ben.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.835
You the head of this department too?

18:16.571 --> 18:19.097
You walk down.  You don't slide.

18:19.307 --> 18:24.109
You know something?  If you don't watch out,
you're gonna grow up to be a witch.

18:30.253 --> 18:34.053
For a guy with no money,
he sure could get complicated.

18:34.691 --> 18:38.492
Well, we've got ourselves a house.
The timing was perfect.

18:38.696 --> 18:40.186
More coffee, Ben?
No thanks.

18:40.397 --> 18:41.455
Daddy?
Please, dear.

18:41.665 --> 18:45.625
What have youo decided to do about the witch?
We mustn't call her that.

18:45.837 --> 18:50.035
It's a perfect name.
You know, I have a feeling she doesn't like me much.

18:50.242 --> 18:52.301
I have a feeling she doesn't like anybody much.

18:52.511 --> 18:54.570
We told her we couldn't pay her,
and didn't need her....

18:54.779 --> 18:58.238
... But she asked us if she could stay on
here, til shefound something else.

18:58.451 --> 19:00.214
Practically begged us.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.878
I guess she's got some money of her own.
After all, she lived here for years...

19:04.091 --> 19:06.253
... And Dr. Zorba paid her a good salary.

19:06.460 --> 19:10.454
Hey, look what I found.
What does "ui-ja" mean?

19:10.664 --> 19:15.933
Why, I haven't seen one of these for years.
It's a ouija board.  See?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.502
"Oui"  French for yes.

19:18.707 --> 19:21.005
"Ja" German for yes.

19:21.211 --> 19:23.644
How to play it?
Where'd you find it?

19:23.847 --> 19:24.865
Over there.

19:24.866 --> 19:27.574
I pushed something on the
fireplace and it opened.

19:27.584 --> 19:30.018
There's a gadget that goes with it, Buck.

19:30.221 --> 19:33.247
I think they call it a  "planchette".

19:36.260 --> 19:37.626
I pushed this.

19:45.605 --> 19:47.095
Here it is.

19:55.149 --> 19:57.049
Looks like it might be old Latin.

19:59.653 --> 20:01.848
How do you use this, Daddy?

20:02.657 --> 20:05.148
"Ouija, the mystifying oracle.

20:05.360 --> 20:09.990
Most  modern method of fortune telling.
Anybody want to try?

20:12.334 --> 20:16.966
I have a friend at the university who can probably translate this.
I'll take it over to him tomorrow.

20:17.173 --> 20:20.267
My boss, Mr. Van Allen,
talks Latin in his sleep.

20:20.477 --> 20:22.945
If he can't translate it, no one can.

20:23.146 --> 20:27.140
You want your fortune told?
Now, here's how it works.

20:29.220 --> 20:33.419
Everybody puts one finger on this.
Just lightly.

20:33.624 --> 20:36.890
Then, somebody asks a question.

20:40.332 --> 20:43.359
We all concentrate on it,
and the Ouija will answer it.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.471
Oh, come on Cy.
It will.  It's magic.

20:46.673 --> 20:49.438
Come on.  Everybody put a finger on it.

20:51.579 --> 20:56.016
Okay.  Just lightly.
Okay.  Now somebody ask a question.

20:56.217 --> 21:00.416
Oh.  By the way.
If you ask a silly question, it won't answer.

21:00.889 --> 21:03.949
Ben, you ask a question.
Alright.

21:04.159 --> 21:07.823
Here's the question.
Is Medea in love?

21:10.266 --> 21:12.700
Concentrate now.
No cheating.

21:17.074 --> 21:19.838
You see?
It was a silly question.

21:20.044 --> 21:23.480
Can I ask a question, Daddy?
All right, Buck.

21:25.750 --> 21:26.978
Lightly.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.884
Are there any ghosts in this house?

21:42.169 --> 21:45.536
I was pushing toward "No",
but you all ganged up on me.

21:45.740 --> 21:48.970
No, I was helping you, Ben.
And I think this is silly.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.772
You don't want to play?
It's rigged.

21:52.980 --> 21:56.438
how can you say that after
what you told me this afternoon?

21:56.652 --> 21:58.176
That's a toy.

21:59.354 --> 22:03.724
You want to play, Daddy?
I think I'll go along with Hilda and Ben.

22:03.926 --> 22:05.326
Let's stop.

22:06.229 --> 22:08.094
Do you want to try it with me, Buck?

22:11.702 --> 22:13.693
You ask the question, Buck.

22:16.173 --> 22:18.471
How many?
How many what?

22:19.978 --> 22:20.967
It knows.

22:37.131 --> 22:39.099
Thirteen what?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.358
Ghosts.

22:45.607 --> 22:47.199
You ask it.

22:55.217 --> 22:57.048
Are they going to hurt us?

23:13.372 --> 23:16.169
Don't fool around with that thing
anymore, Medea.

23:19.444 --> 23:21.912
Let's ask it,  but don't touch it.

23:23.283 --> 23:24.647
You ask it.

23:26.019 --> 23:28.613
Are they going to kill any of us?

24:02.292 --> 24:04.158
Don't ask it when.

24:04.962 --> 24:06.020
I don't want to know.

24:07.765 --> 24:12.226
But it was just floating in the air.
There was nothing touching it.

24:12.437 --> 24:15.366
There's probably a very
simple explanation for it.

24:15.374 --> 24:18.310
I don't know what it could be.
Oh, Cy.  I'm frightened.

24:18.410 --> 24:20.777
Of what?
A silly game?

24:20.980 --> 24:22.039
Ghosts.

24:22.249 --> 24:26.118
Oh now listen, honey.
Maybe Zorba was a very strange man who...

24:26.319 --> 24:29.847
... could see ghosts and do supernatural things.

24:30.057 --> 24:31.319
But we aren't him.

24:31.525 --> 24:35.155
We're just ordinary people
who don't have any supernatural powers and...

24:35.363 --> 24:38.128
...don't want any.
Here it is.

24:38.333 --> 24:40.130
The codicil 11.

24:41.971 --> 24:43.900
If we don't elect to live in this house...

24:44.106 --> 24:47.803
... it goes to the state as part of a park system.

24:48.379 --> 24:51.906
And once we move in, we have to stay.

24:52.116 --> 24:55.313
You mean we can't sell it even if we want to?
Nope.

24:55.519 --> 24:59.422
If we don't live here, it goes
to the state.  Golly.

24:59.624 --> 25:03.526
Living in this house make a difference
between sinking and swimming.

25:03.728 --> 25:06.459
Just not paying rent
saves half salary.

25:06.665 --> 25:09.999
- Cy, why is it so cold?
- I do not know.

25:10.836 --> 25:13.931
Window open I guess.
But it's freezing!

25:21.181 --> 25:22.410
What's that?

25:23.083 --> 25:24.813
The wind probably.

25:26.454 --> 25:29.014
I'll say goodnight to the children.

25:29.657 --> 25:31.591
Leave the door open!

25:31.927 --> 25:33.120
Okay.
Yeah.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.219
- Medea.
Come in.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.554
Hi.
Hi.

26:12.206 --> 26:16.302
Old Doc Zorba sure went in
for antiques, didn't he?

26:17.344 --> 26:18.834
I sort of like them.

26:20.715 --> 26:24.412
I hope you're not too upset by...
what happened.

26:24.853 --> 26:26.116
Just a game.

26:26.321 --> 26:28.722
I know.   Silly, wasn't  it?

26:29.558 --> 26:34.894
I think all this spook talk of Ben's
is...got us all imagining things.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.828
Daddy?

26:38.034 --> 26:39.331
Yes, darling.

26:40.570 --> 26:43.300
Do you really think there are
ghosts in this house?

26:43.741 --> 26:45.868
Oh.  Of course not.

26:46.177 --> 26:50.841
Now.  It's time for all pretty girls
to go to sleep.

26:51.783 --> 26:53.115
Good night.

26:54.953 --> 26:56.352
Don't worry.

27:04.230 --> 27:05.720
I'll leave this open.

27:06.434 --> 27:07.366
Fine.

27:18.213 --> 27:20.204
All clear on the off spring front.

27:20.415 --> 27:23.385
I'm going down and get a book.
Be back in a minute.

29:30.329 --> 29:31.625
Thirteen...

29:33.198 --> 29:34.825
Thirteen...

29:36.235 --> 29:38.202
Thirteen...

29:39.171 --> 29:41.003
Thirteen...

33:00.631 --> 33:01.996
Any luck?

33:03.468 --> 33:04.764
Luck?

33:05.070 --> 33:06.594
Can't you read it, Van?

33:06.804 --> 33:09.296
Yes I can read it.  It's Latin.

33:09.508 --> 33:11.806
Well...What's it about?

33:13.913 --> 33:15.676
What's it about?

33:24.279 --> 33:25.399
Cy.

33:25.526 --> 33:29.121
At first I thought your uncle
was another one of those fakes.

33:30.197 --> 33:31.688
But now I'm not so sure.

33:33.803 --> 33:34.827
Here.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.610
I found this in the university publications.

33:42.612 --> 33:44.705
It's printed 10 years ago.

33:47.384 --> 33:50.012
" The Professor who advertises
for haunted houses...

33:50.221 --> 33:52.246
... so he can photograph ghosts ...

33:52.456 --> 33:57.053
... is Dr. Plato Zorba,
a scientist of unquestioned repute.

33:57.328 --> 34:00.456
Dr. Zorba's experience with ghosts
in many parts of the world...

34:00.666 --> 34:03.726
... convinced him they are
unhappily earth bound ...

34:03.936 --> 34:06.996
... because of unsolved problems.

34:08.241 --> 34:12.234
Dr. Zorba has perfected a device
with which he can see ghosts...

34:12.445 --> 34:16.040
... and is working on a method of
ultraviolet ray photography...

34:16.250 --> 34:19.185
... which will enable him to take
permanent pictures...

34:19.387 --> 34:21.947
... of the supernatural world. "

34:25.761 --> 34:27.728
He wasn't a fake.

34:28.697 --> 34:32.793
This....this is a record of years
of work in the world of spirits.

34:33.435 --> 34:37.235
If any of this is true,
I don't say all, just any of it...

34:37.440 --> 34:41.070
... then your uncle had penetrated
farther into the supernatural...

34:41.277 --> 34:43.472
... than any man in history.

34:45.149 --> 34:48.915
He captured 11 ghosts.
Captured?

34:49.853 --> 34:54.154
Dr. Zorba proved, that if you could see
a ghost, you could control it...

34:54.560 --> 34:56.186
... to a certain extent.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.860
Yes, I think so.

35:05.505 --> 35:09.771
There is a section describing exactly how
he made the lenses for those glasses.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.569
It took him years.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.906
And then traveled all over the world.

35:14.848 --> 35:17.910
He found one ghost in a castle in Ireland.

35:18.119 --> 35:20.486
Another one in the catacombs below Rome.

35:20.688 --> 35:23.624
He caught one in a village in Italy.
Another one in Tibet.

35:25.194 --> 35:28.392
I wonder which ones I saw last night.

35:29.732 --> 35:32.327
Each ghost has a separate section.

35:33.937 --> 35:35.632
This is the last one...

35:36.874 --> 35:38.398
... Ghost 12.

35:39.543 --> 35:40.703
You said 11.

35:42.213 --> 35:43.475
Twelve.

35:44.181 --> 35:48.084
"I, Plato Zorba, am the 12th...

35:48.286 --> 35:50.686
Earth bound not for the crimes I've committed...

35:50.889 --> 35:53.153
... but for crimes
committed against me...

35:53.359 --> 35:57.386
... and which I shall revenge
before I be released...

35:57.663 --> 35:59.563
... from haunting the Earth ".

36:00.868 --> 36:02.802
And here's a curious thing...

36:03.704 --> 36:06.265
he wrote, "ghost 13".

36:06.874 --> 36:09.069
The rest of the page is blank.

36:13.248 --> 36:15.240
Paleontology. Van Allen.

36:15.450 --> 36:17.185
Yes.  Hold on.

36:17.710 --> 36:19.910
Oh.  Hello?

36:19.955 --> 36:21.445
Cy?  I want you to come home.

36:21.658 --> 36:23.955
I'm pretty busy, honey.
What's the trouble?

36:24.161 --> 36:29.058
There is no use trying to tell you.
I want you to come home right away.

36:29.066 --> 36:30.694
Cy?
I'm on my way.

36:32.035 --> 36:34.630
I've got to go home, Van.
The ghosts?

36:37.675 --> 36:38.665
I don't know.

36:38.876 --> 36:40.572
Have they hurt anyone?

36:41.713 --> 36:43.305
I don't know.

37:20.924 --> 37:22.044
Hilda?

37:23.894 --> 37:25.014
Hilda!

37:26.180 --> 37:27.300
Hilda!

37:30.101 --> 37:31.728
You.. you alright?

37:32.270 --> 37:33.532
The kids?

37:34.038 --> 37:35.198
Well then?

37:35.407 --> 37:37.135
You come in here.

37:45.618 --> 37:46.779
Well, what happened?

37:46.987 --> 37:49.547
They came off the shelves and broke.

37:50.157 --> 37:52.022
You mean they..they fell off?

37:52.225 --> 37:54.421
They came off!

38:13.049 --> 38:14.414
I've had enough, Cy.

38:25.764 --> 38:28.460
Stop it!   Stop it I say!

38:34.073 --> 38:35.199
That was Emilio.

38:35.775 --> 38:36.605
Who?

38:36.876 --> 38:40.972
Emilio. He was an Italian chef.
They killed his wife.

38:41.181 --> 38:44.275
He killed his mother in law too.
And his sister in law.

38:44.484 --> 38:46.452
With a meat cleaver.

38:46.509 --> 38:48.329
Whack.  Whack.  Whack.

38:48.523 --> 38:50.252
You better stand over there.

38:52.427 --> 38:53.758
What for?

38:54.063 --> 38:56.394
He doesn't mess up the kitchen often...

38:56.599 --> 38:59.193
... But when it does, wow!

39:03.106 --> 39:04.766
Now Emilio is through.

39:06.009 --> 39:07.772
Now I'm through.

39:11.415 --> 39:13.508
Who told you all this?

39:13.718 --> 39:16.950
The witch. Elaine.
She knows alot we don't know.

39:17.154 --> 39:19.055
Like what?
- Well...

39:19.257 --> 39:23.194
... She knows most of the ghosts.
She's even seen some of em'.

39:23.395 --> 39:25.990
She's about the creepiest
person I've ever met.

39:26.665 --> 39:27.928
Don't you think so?

39:28.133 --> 39:31.262
Well, she's uh...different.

39:32.305 --> 39:35.172
Maybe she one of the ghosts herself.
What then?

39:36.050 --> 39:37.170
Ooohhh.

39:40.849 --> 39:43.043
Suppose they hurt one of the children.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.014
I don't think they would.

39:45.219 --> 39:48.121
A few more inches and that cleaver
would have cut off your head.

39:48.323 --> 39:49.756
And look at the burn on your hand.

39:49.958 --> 39:53.326
So how can you say that they won't
hurt Buck or Medea, or you again?

39:53.529 --> 39:55.360
Things will calm down, Hilda.

39:55.564 --> 39:58.965
Oh, Cy, let's get out of here.
We're in danger.

40:03.006 --> 40:04.473
You sent for me?

40:04.675 --> 40:06.165
Yes, Elaine.

40:12.517 --> 40:15.180
There are some questions
I'd like to ask you.

40:15.387 --> 40:18.151
How long did you
work for Dr. Zorba?

40:18.357 --> 40:19.517
For many years.

40:19.725 --> 40:22.489
You knew about his experiments
with the supernatural?

40:22.696 --> 40:24.060
I helped him.

40:24.264 --> 40:27.927
When he was alive,
he could control them, but now...

40:28.268 --> 40:29.736
I'm afraid...

40:29.936 --> 40:31.563
I never was before...

40:31.772 --> 40:33.568
... But now I am.

40:34.574 --> 40:37.510
I can't help feeling that
our living here...

40:37.712 --> 40:40.246
... everything that
has happened to us

40:40.247 --> 40:41.546
is all part of a plan...

40:41.750 --> 40:44.480
... That Dr. Zorba wants
us to do something.

40:46.723 --> 40:47.882
But what?

40:49.359 --> 40:50.917
I can't help you.

40:51.127 --> 40:53.755
He used to trust me,
and in those days I helped him...

40:53.963 --> 40:55.591
... with the cameras and lenses.

40:55.798 --> 40:59.166
But towards the last...
he trusted no one.

40:59.536 --> 41:02.097
Were you and Ben the only friends he had?

41:02.306 --> 41:05.640
Ben only.    He turned against me.

41:06.010 --> 41:09.207
He was doing foolish things and
I wanted him to stop, but he would not.

41:09.414 --> 41:11.474
His experiments?
Those too.

41:11.684 --> 41:15.176
But mainly I objected when he
converted everything into cash.

41:15.388 --> 41:18.221
Stocks, bonds, real estate, everything.

41:18.858 --> 41:21.760
And then he withdrew all his
accounts from the banks.

41:21.962 --> 41:23.190
It was foolish.

41:23.397 --> 41:25.524
What did he do with the money?
No one knows.

41:25.732 --> 41:27.359
There is no record of it.

41:27.568 --> 41:32.062
Ben and I spent days searching the
house for it after he died, but found nothing.

41:32.273 --> 41:35.731
Maybe he spent it.
On what?  He had everything he needed.

41:35.944 --> 41:38.970
Besides, he never left the house.
Maybe he gave it away.

41:39.615 --> 41:42.015
 I knew Plato Zorba very well.

41:42.217 --> 41:44.846
He never gave away anything.

41:45.054 --> 41:47.113
This house is not a gift, really.

41:47.490 --> 41:51.017
It's a burden.  Perhaps a curse.

41:52.463 --> 41:54.863
The last thing he wrote...

41:55.065 --> 41:57.830
...was about a crime committed against him.

41:58.035 --> 41:59.970
What did he mean by that?

42:00.272 --> 42:01.261
I don't know.

42:01.973 --> 42:05.374
How did he die, Elaine?  And where?

42:05.577 --> 42:07.169
I'll show you.

42:08.613 --> 42:10.206
I'll stay here.

42:31.573 --> 42:33.906
This was Dr. Zorba's bedroom.

42:35.311 --> 42:37.404
That is where he died.

42:38.281 --> 42:40.681
How did he die, Elaine?

42:40.950 --> 42:43.852
The spirits from the other world.

42:44.054 --> 42:46.148
Is that what you told the coroner?

42:46.356 --> 42:48.916
He wouldn't have believed me any more than you.

42:50.428 --> 42:53.592
The official cause of death was suffication.

42:55.133 --> 42:56.497
Who saw him last?

42:56.702 --> 42:58.966
I mean, was anyone here
when he died?

42:59.171 --> 43:03.199
I was here, in the house, but I
didn't see him that night at all.

43:03.408 --> 43:05.673
He and Ben were working on his will.

43:05.879 --> 43:09.509
Did Ben see him die?
Oh no.  Ben had gone.

43:09.716 --> 43:13.175
Dr. Zorba died sometime later that night.

43:13.386 --> 43:16.686
I found him the next morning there.

43:17.959 --> 43:19.483
What did the police say about it?

43:19.694 --> 43:23.562
They talked mostly to Ben.
I called him first.

43:26.502 --> 43:30.768
I hated this room.
For years I never came in here.

43:30.973 --> 43:34.670
But that morning I did.
I don't know why.

43:34.878 --> 43:38.678
Something seemed to be pulling me to this place.

43:42.453 --> 43:46.981
If you stay here, you too, will learn
not to come into this room.

43:47.191 --> 43:50.058
What do you mean,
"if I stay here"?

43:50.996 --> 43:54.591
You should get out of this house now!
Tonight!

46:40.987 --> 46:43.922
It was a wonderful evening, Ben.
Thanks.

46:44.457 --> 46:48.258
How about some coffee before you go?
No Thanks.  Not tonight.

46:48.462 --> 46:51.363
I wish you and your family were
staying somewhere else.

46:51.566 --> 46:54.160
This place gives me the creeps.
It always has.

46:54.368 --> 46:55.995
Don't start on that again.

46:56.204 --> 46:58.172
I worry about you, Medea.

46:58.373 --> 47:00.864
Just for me, will you try to be a little careful?

47:01.077 --> 47:04.376
For you, I'll pull the covers
over my head tonight.

47:04.580 --> 47:06.775
See you tomorrow?
Well, I hope so.

47:06.983 --> 47:09.213
Don't worry, Ben.  I'll be careful.

47:09.752 --> 47:12.551
Thanks again. Good night.
Good night.

50:08.420 --> 50:09.712
Daddy, Daddy!

50:09.722 --> 50:11.315
Darling.  Darling.
What happened?

50:11.523 --> 50:13.115
Come in here .

51:11.224 --> 51:12.589
Oh, good morning.

51:59.979 --> 52:01.970
Well, how is she?

52:02.181 --> 52:03.671
I'm getting her breakfast now.

52:03.884 --> 52:05.943
godd thing there were some
of those pills left.

52:06.152 --> 52:09.817
Did you call Buck?
Yeah.  Yeah, I yelled as I went by.

52:52.739 --> 52:56.140
Back you lion, back!
I'm Shadrack the Great.

52:56.342 --> 52:58.833
Back!
Down you lion, down!

52:59.113 --> 53:01.012
I'm Shadrack!

56:28.882 --> 56:30.406
I met a lion.

56:30.617 --> 56:33.815
That's good.
And a man without a head.

56:34.087 --> 56:35.486
Mmm Hmm
Now you take this to up to Medea, dear.

56:35.688 --> 56:38.317
And then you come back
and eat your own breakfast, hmm?

57:07.458 --> 57:09.256
Morning, Buck.
Hi, Ben.

57:09.460 --> 57:12.328
Medea is in bed.
She saw a ghost last night.

57:12.530 --> 57:15.125
I just saw a lion and a man without a head.

57:15.634 --> 57:17.329
What do you know.
No head at all?

57:17.837 --> 57:20.806
I think the lion bit it off
because the man was looking for her.

57:21.140 --> 57:22.937
I've got some papers for your dad.

57:23.143 --> 57:25.801
He's gone to work.
I have to bring Medea her breakfast.

57:25.838 --> 57:27.238
Buck?
Hmm?

57:27.647 --> 57:31.310
Where did you get all that money?
I found it on the floor.

57:32.053 --> 57:34.953
When?
Just before you rang the bell.

57:35.690 --> 57:38.454
Exactly where did you find it?

57:40.662 --> 57:41.993
Right there.

57:42.531 --> 57:43.623
Exactly?

57:43.832 --> 57:47.496
Somewhere around there.
Think it belongs to some ghost?

57:47.703 --> 57:50.070
Well you found it.
It belongs to you.

57:50.273 --> 57:51.467
You mean I can keep it?

57:51.774 --> 57:55.141
Sure.
It was just laying on the floor?

57:57.181 --> 57:58.306
Just those two?

57:58.882 --> 58:00.748
That's a lot of money, $ 200.

58:01.629 --> 58:02.749
Buck.

58:03.421 --> 58:06.219
What were you doing just
before you found the money?

58:06.691 --> 58:09.354
Skating?
No skating in the house.

58:10.863 --> 58:12.261
Sliding down the bannister?

58:13.399 --> 58:15.060
Are you going to tell Medea?

58:15.268 --> 58:17.931
Well, we're pals.
Don't you know that?

58:18.137 --> 58:20.834
I keep your secrets and you keep mine.
Okay?

58:21.159 --> 58:22.107
Okay.

58:22.108 --> 58:24.671
But I don't have any secrets.

58:24.678 --> 58:26.236
Well I'll give you one.

58:26.246 --> 58:29.704
You take Medea's breakfast
up to her and then come right back.

58:29.918 --> 58:32.318
And don't tell her I'm here.
Promise?

58:32.520 --> 58:33.714
I can keep a secret.

58:33.922 --> 58:36.983
And don't say anything about
finding the money.

58:37.893 --> 58:39.520
I'll be right back.

59:03.055 --> 59:04.852
Here's your breakfast.

59:05.958 --> 59:08.757
I just saw a lion and a man without a head.

59:08.961 --> 59:10.896
What did you see last night?

59:11.096 --> 59:12.894
An apperition.  At the window.

59:13.299 --> 59:14.994
Do we have them too?

59:15.202 --> 59:17.432
I guess we're the only family in the whole world...

59:17.638 --> 59:19.663
... with thier own apparition and ghosts.

59:19.873 --> 59:21.204
Why don't you get up?

59:21.408 --> 59:24.606
As long as you bring me breakfast
in bed, why should I get up?

59:25.714 --> 59:28.205
Where's mother?
In the kitchen.

59:28.717 --> 59:29.945
Where's Elaine?

59:30.152 --> 59:32.847
I don't know.  Well, I got to go.

59:33.421 --> 59:34.821
What's so important?

59:35.024 --> 59:36.616
Got to keep a secret.

59:37.126 --> 59:38.992
What secret, Buck?

59:53.177 --> 59:55.372
You didn't tell her?
Nope.

59:55.581 --> 59:56.808
Good man.

59:58.017 --> 01:00:01.714
Now I'm gonna tell you the biggest
secret you ever heard.

01:00:01.921 --> 01:00:05.049
If you promise not to
tell a living soul.

01:00:05.257 --> 01:00:08.352
I won't even tell a ghosts,
and the're not living.

01:00:08.628 --> 01:00:10.687
There's a treasure hidden in this house.

01:00:11.131 --> 01:00:12.223
Pirates?

01:00:12.433 --> 01:00:13.661
Sort of.

01:00:13.868 --> 01:00:16.861
Before old Dr. Zorba died,
he hid all his money.

01:00:19.374 --> 01:00:20.841
This must be some of it.

01:00:21.043 --> 01:00:24.206
Well there's alot more,
and you and I are gonna find it.

01:00:24.413 --> 01:00:26.506
If Medea will get up,
we'll make her hunt too.

01:00:26.782 --> 01:00:28.716
No, no. That's the secret.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.982
You and I are going to find the
money all by ourselves.

01:00:32.355 --> 01:00:35.654
Aren't we gonna give dad any?
Or mother or Medea?

01:00:35.859 --> 01:00:39.386
We're gonna give it all to them.
But let me ask you this...

01:00:39.897 --> 01:00:44.664
Suppose we have to uh... maybe
cut a hole in the wall someplace.

01:00:44.869 --> 01:00:47.497
Now, if you told your dad,
what would he say?

01:00:48.206 --> 01:00:50.869
well, he might not understand.

01:00:51.076 --> 01:00:54.103
That's why this has to be
just between you and me.

01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:57.244
Okay.  When do we start?

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.645
First, you've got to hide that.

01:01:00.721 --> 01:01:04.919
Next, I've got to make some plans.
And tonight we start.

01:01:05.292 --> 01:01:07.727
Maybe I could hunt around some today!

01:01:07.961 --> 01:01:10.088
Okay. But be careful.

01:01:10.298 --> 01:01:14.793
If anybody comes in while you're hunting,
you act like nothing is happening.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:23.244
Now, don't tell anybody about finding the money.

01:01:23.445 --> 01:01:27.280
And don't tell anybody about the treasure hunt.
and Buck...

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.342
... Don't tell anybody I was here this morning.

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:32.886
Right?
Right.

01:01:34.272 --> 01:01:35.292
Ben?

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:39.318
Suppose somebody asks me...
right straight out...

01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:41.362
"Was Ben here today?"

01:01:41.867 --> 01:01:45.599
I wasn't here, Buck.
Now that's the way it has to be.

01:01:58.786 --> 01:02:00.048
Who was that, Buck?

01:02:00.555 --> 01:02:02.044
Huh?
Who went out?

01:02:02.557 --> 01:02:06.857
Nobody, Medea.
And besides, it's a secret.

01:02:22.146 --> 01:02:23.580
Come in.

01:02:25.350 --> 01:02:27.749
Hello, Ben.
If you're busy,  I can come back later.

01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:29.302
No no.

01:02:30.287 --> 01:02:32.727
I'm glad you're here.
I wanna talk to you.

01:02:32.728 --> 01:02:33.387
Sit down.

01:02:35.828 --> 01:02:39.389
Ben, we've been in that
house two nights.

01:02:39.598 --> 01:02:42.363
The first, I got this.

01:02:42.568 --> 01:02:45.060
Last night, they attacked Medea.
Medea!

01:02:45.438 --> 01:02:46.700
They didn't hurt her.

01:02:46.906 --> 01:02:48.841
Why Medea?

01:02:48.842 --> 01:02:52.505
Was she wearing those glasses Zorba made?

01:02:52.913 --> 01:02:54.608
No.. no she wasn't.

01:02:56.917 --> 01:02:58.578
What's going to happen, Ben?

01:02:58.787 --> 01:03:01.722
Is my family going to be
terrorized every night?

01:03:01.923 --> 01:03:03.914
Maybe this is the answer, Cy.

01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:05.922
I think I can legally get the state
to pay you for the house and grounds...

01:03:06.127 --> 01:03:08.753
But the will said...

01:03:08.965 --> 01:03:10.956
You've only been in the house three days.

01:03:11.067 --> 01:03:13.161
The longest days in my life.

01:03:13.369 --> 01:03:16.771
I bet you'll be glad to get
your family out of there.

01:03:16.974 --> 01:03:19.841
See, we can say you never
actually took possession.

01:03:20.043 --> 01:03:21.908
Now how soon can you move?

01:03:22.113 --> 01:03:24.411
Right away,  I guess.
Good.

01:03:24.616 --> 01:03:27.483
If I we're you I wouldn't spend
another night in that house,

01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:29.414
under any circumstances.

01:03:33.659 --> 01:03:36.629
Zorba, Paleontology.
Oh, hi ya, Buck.

01:03:38.698 --> 01:03:40.426
Yes, yes.  It's alright.

01:03:41.534 --> 01:03:44.765
A secret?
Well, tell me about it, son.

01:03:45.972 --> 01:03:49.965
Alright, Buck.   Just as you say.
See you later.

01:03:51.646 --> 01:03:53.204
Buck's all excited.

01:03:53.414 --> 01:03:55.007
Any trouble?

01:03:55.217 --> 01:03:56.877
He's got a secret.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.381
A big surprise for me.

01:04:00.589 --> 01:04:01.681
What is it?

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:03.552
He wouldn't tell me.

01:04:03.993 --> 01:04:08.259
I think you could cut his arm off,
and he still wouldn't tell.

01:04:08.465 --> 01:04:11.729
Good kid.
Well,  can you move today?

01:04:11.936 --> 01:04:14.700
We haven't much to move, except ourselves.

01:04:14.905 --> 01:04:18.603
I think I'll be able to get
you $ 10,000 from the state.

01:04:20.277 --> 01:04:22.473
Hey, Cy. This will interest you.

01:04:23.114 --> 01:04:25.275
Oh.  So sorry.
I can speak to you later.

01:04:25.484 --> 01:04:27.952
No, no, Van.   Stay.

01:04:28.888 --> 01:04:32.289
Ben Rush,  this is my boss,  Mr. Van Allen.
How do you do, sir?

01:04:32.491 --> 01:04:34.323
How do you do.
Listen to this.

01:04:34.528 --> 01:04:36.996
Almost the last thing Dr. Zorba wrote.

01:04:37.497 --> 01:04:40.091
"Today I finished converting
my assets into cash...

01:04:40.301 --> 01:04:44.669
... and put it where unscrupulous
men can no longer steal it from me."

01:04:45.273 --> 01:04:47.332
I wonder where that is.

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:49.476
If he never left the house?

01:04:49.677 --> 01:04:53.671
Don't forget...he wrote this
about... only a month ago.

01:04:54.316 --> 01:04:55.977
What do you think, Ben?

01:04:56.185 --> 01:04:58.848
Maybe we shouldn't be in
such a hurry to move.

01:04:59.054 --> 01:05:02.422
Well it isn't likely.  I handled Zorba's
affairs for a year.

01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:06.026
I don't think he could've kept any
large amount of money secret from me.

01:05:07.264 --> 01:05:10.631
Well, after reading this, I wouldn't be
surprised at anything...

01:05:10.835 --> 01:05:13.327
... natural or supernatural, Zorba did.

01:05:13.537 --> 01:05:17.201
For instance, he spoke with the
spirits of the dead like uh...

01:05:17.409 --> 01:05:19.741
... you and I chat with the grocer.

01:05:19.945 --> 01:05:22.346
He and a medium called
Elaine Zacharides...

01:05:22.547 --> 01:05:24.277
...used to sit around at a Séance...

01:05:24.484 --> 01:05:27.613
... talking with people dead for 5 centuries.

01:05:28.155 --> 01:05:31.249
All you have to do is find Elaine Zacharides.

01:05:31.457 --> 01:05:34.450
I don't have to find her.
She's the housekeeper.

01:05:35.529 --> 01:05:37.760
Would she hold a Séance with you?

01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:43.037
I don't know.

01:05:43.238 --> 01:05:45.968
I doubt it.
She's pretty stubborn.

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:49.042
Anyway, you're moving out
so there won't be time.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:52.237
But, if she'd do it, we'd take time.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:55.009
Maybe..maybe she'd hold a Séance tonight.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:57.152
Then we could move out tomorrow.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:02.091
If we could bring the spirit of Zorba back...

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:05.258
... I wonder what we'd find out.

01:06:13.305 --> 01:06:15.068
What's a Séance?

01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:17.274
You talk to spirits.

01:06:17.977 --> 01:06:20.241
Buck, why don't you go and pack your things?

01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:22.540
How does it work?
I do not know.

01:06:22.749 --> 01:06:24.479
Hand me the dress, will you?

01:06:25.185 --> 01:06:28.087
How does Elaine know?
I do not know.

01:06:28.389 --> 01:06:30.949
Oh, I'll be so glad to get out of this house.

01:06:31.158 --> 01:06:33.319
Well, what happens?

01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:36.589
Oh, you sit around the table holding hands.

01:06:36.797 --> 01:06:39.028
Buck, will please go and help mother?

01:06:39.234 --> 01:06:41.031
What good does that do?

01:06:41.504 --> 01:06:43.698
The spirits talk to you.

01:06:44.073 --> 01:06:46.735
What do they say?
I do not know.

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:48.810
Buck, will you please go!

01:06:49.679 --> 01:06:52.410
Why pack?
We're not going to anywhere.

01:06:52.616 --> 01:06:55.380
You heard dad.
Were leaving first thing in the morning.

01:06:55.486 --> 01:06:56.606
Medea?

01:06:57.922 --> 01:06:59.115
Yes, Buck.

01:06:59.324 --> 01:07:02.760
Suppose you had a secret.
How you would keep it?

01:07:03.561 --> 01:07:05.051
You have a secret?

01:07:06.999 --> 01:07:08.193
What is it?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.393
Well, it's a...
Hey, I'm not going to tell you what it is.

01:07:12.706 --> 01:07:14.905
Well who is it with?
Ben.

01:07:14.936 --> 01:07:16.056
Oh.

01:07:16.276 --> 01:07:17.868
What's it about?

01:07:18.078 --> 01:07:20.546
Well, is it alright to say what it's about?

01:07:20.748 --> 01:07:23.979
Sure, as long as you don't tell the secret itself.

01:07:24.452 --> 01:07:27.286
Well, you see, Ben and I...

01:07:28.523 --> 01:07:30.957
Need any help?
No, I just finished packing, mom.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.857
Good.   If it weren't for this Séance
nonsense, we could leave right now.

01:07:35.063 --> 01:07:36.928
I can go to the Séance, can't I mom?

01:07:37.133 --> 01:07:38.657
Absolutely not.

01:07:38.868 --> 01:07:41.200
Aw, I've never been to one.

01:07:41.404 --> 01:07:45.465
It'll be fun.
Boy, maybe somebody will get murdered.

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:49.643
Well you can't go to this one.
Anyway, it's past  your bed time.

01:07:49.847 --> 01:07:51.974
I'll tell you everything that happens.

01:07:52.183 --> 01:07:54.879
Yeah well, that's not like seeing it.

01:07:57.455 --> 01:08:00.983
Right in here. We're ready to start.

01:08:01.359 --> 01:08:03.294
Will you sit there, Mr. Zorba?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:06.056
Your wife here, your daughter here.

01:08:11.605 --> 01:08:13.664
The most important thing, is concentration.

01:08:14.308 --> 01:08:17.573
Let your minds think of nothing
except  bringing back to this room...

01:08:17.778 --> 01:08:18.939
... the spirit of Zorba.

01:08:19.147 --> 01:08:21.171
We will now join hands.

01:08:22.984 --> 01:08:25.078
Cy, do you think this is really necessary?

01:08:25.286 --> 01:08:26.549
Please, honey.

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.384
What can we expect ?
I mean, what will happen?

01:08:32.595 --> 01:08:35.792
Perhaps nothing.  Perhaps anything.

01:08:37.267 --> 01:08:40.566
Doctor Zorba and I experienced
total recall with some spirits.

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:43.466
With others we could
make no contact at all.

01:08:43.707 --> 01:08:46.541
If he comes back, he
may speak through me...

01:08:46.743 --> 01:08:49.042
... or he may choose one of you

01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:50.808
One of us?

01:08:51.148 --> 01:08:55.984
Yes.   Although I'm the medium,
he may choose one of you.

01:08:56.389 --> 01:08:58.380
He may even appear.

01:08:58.624 --> 01:09:00.091
There's no way to tell.

01:09:01.027 --> 01:09:03.551
What can happen?
I mean, say he does come.

01:09:03.764 --> 01:09:05.662
Can we carry on a conversation?

01:09:05.999 --> 01:09:07.558
It's possible.

01:09:08.002 --> 01:09:09.935
Let us try for just a short time.

01:09:10.136 --> 01:09:13.801
It's very difficult being a medium.
And dangerous.

01:09:14.008 --> 01:09:18.069
Besides, as I told you, Dr. Zorba
no longer trusted me.

01:09:18.846 --> 01:09:20.747
Now will you please turn out the lights.

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:23.350
And then we must all concentrate.

01:09:23.551 --> 01:09:25.986
Just...just a moment, please.

01:09:44.408 --> 01:09:45.604
Ready?

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:14.968
The treasure!

01:10:16.547 --> 01:10:20.148
Buck.   You're suppose to be in bed.

01:10:21.473 --> 01:10:22.873
I...uh...

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:26.818
All we're doing is sitting around
the table. Nothing is happening.

01:10:27.024 --> 01:10:29.549
I'm not trying to see your old ghosts.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.728
I'm waiting for Ben.
We've got a secret.

01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:34.261
Ben?  He's not coming here tonight.

01:10:34.466 --> 01:10:36.593
He might.
Is a pretty big secret.

01:10:36.801 --> 01:10:40.533
Yes.  You told me.
But it can wait until tomorrow.

01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:44.935
Can't I wait up five more minutes,
if I promise not to peek?

01:10:45.478 --> 01:10:48.312
Okay. Five minutes.

01:10:57.458 --> 01:10:58.982
I'm sorry.

01:11:02.964 --> 01:11:05.091
Dr. Zorba...

01:11:05.367 --> 01:11:07.835
Dr. Zorba...

01:11:24.430 --> 01:11:25.830
Dr. Zorba...

01:11:27.602 --> 01:11:29.002
Dr. Zorba...

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:42.269
Zorba...

01:11:44.742 --> 01:11:46.462
Zorba..

01:11:51.553 --> 01:11:53.817
In death...

01:11:54.489 --> 01:11:56.582
In death...

01:11:57.325 --> 01:11:58.815
Do not move!

01:11:59.028 --> 01:12:01.155
No matter what happens, do not move.

01:13:05.769 --> 01:13:08.363
Ben, I found it!  Come on.

01:13:10.874 --> 01:13:12.034
See?

01:13:12.243 --> 01:13:14.541
Good work, Buck.  Good work.

01:13:15.113 --> 01:13:19.447
Does anybody else know?
Of course not.  Let's tell em'.   Ow!

01:13:19.752 --> 01:13:22.618
You're hurting!
Oh, I'm sorry, Buck.

01:13:23.022 --> 01:13:24.455
We can't tell anyone yet.

01:13:25.024 --> 01:13:26.686
But we're moving out tomorrow.

01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:29.494
That's right.  We've got to get ready...

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:32.995
... so when they're all set to go...
bam!  We give them money.

01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:34.564
Then we won't have to move.

01:13:34.769 --> 01:13:37.999
Right.   Now, we got alot to do tomorrow.

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:39.797
I think you better turn in, Buck.

01:13:40.007 --> 01:13:41.907
You know.  Get all the rest you can.

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:43.532
I'm not sleepy.

01:13:44.412 --> 01:13:46.004
Not sleepy?

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:48.409
I'm gonna be waking 
you so early in the morning...

01:13:48.617 --> 01:13:50.108
... the sun won't even be up.

01:13:50.319 --> 01:13:51.911
We've got work to do.

01:13:52.121 --> 01:13:53.213
And then we'll em'?

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.987
Tomorrow. So, sleep now.

01:13:57.327 --> 01:13:59.420
I'm gonna hit the sack myself.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:01.527
Okay.   Good night.

01:14:04.902 --> 01:14:07.667
You can wake me anytime.
I won't mind.

01:14:07.871 --> 01:14:09.271
Good night, Buck.

01:14:09.641 --> 01:14:11.302
Go right to sleep.

01:14:47.318 --> 01:14:50.710
Cy!   Help him!
No!  You mustn't!   Stay where you are!

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:56.421
Thirteen, thirteen...

01:14:58.996 --> 01:15:01.396
Dead tonight...

01:15:02.099 --> 01:15:04.567
... One of you...

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.091
Are you alright?

01:16:03.936 --> 01:16:06.234
Bring him back.  Please.

01:16:06.438 --> 01:16:08.303
We must know more.

01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:11.773
It is of no use.
There is Interference.

01:16:11.978 --> 01:16:14.573
The ghosts are restless, angry.

01:16:14.881 --> 01:16:17.646
Tonight death walks again...

01:16:17.851 --> 01:16:20.252
... in this evil house.

01:17:12.212 --> 01:17:15.876
Suddenly I...I  became cold.

01:17:16.551 --> 01:17:20.112
And for an instant,
I seemed to black out.

01:17:20.956 --> 01:17:22.253
And then...

01:17:23.058 --> 01:17:27.017
... then I heard a strange voice come from me...

01:17:28.431 --> 01:17:30.695
But I can't remember.

01:17:31.034 --> 01:17:33.196
You... I mean the voice said...

01:17:33.403 --> 01:17:36.669
"Death tonight"
and then the number 13.

01:17:36.874 --> 01:17:38.273
And then he...

01:17:38.843 --> 01:17:41.073
... he said it would be one of us.

01:17:43.849 --> 01:17:47.717
- Where are you going?
Oh.  Just to see if Buck's alright.

01:21:29.469 --> 01:21:32.870
It's Ben!  It's Ben!
The bed it's hurting him!

01:21:34.974 --> 01:21:36.909
... 98, 99, hundred!

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.807
I never thought I'd get tired of this.

01:21:42.217 --> 01:21:45.209
Daddy?   Why did Ben
dress as Zorba's ghost...

01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:48.219
...and appear at my window?
He was trying to frighten you.

01:21:48.423 --> 01:21:50.391
He knew this money was hidden here.

01:21:50.592 --> 01:21:53.187
After he murdered Zorba he tried to find it.

01:21:53.395 --> 01:21:56.387
Then we moved in.  He 
wanted us out of here.

01:21:56.599 --> 01:21:58.897
Where do you think our new
house ought to be?

01:21:59.101 --> 01:22:02.360
New house?
What do we want with a new house?

01:22:02.436 --> 01:22:03.836
Boo.  Boo.

01:22:04.613 --> 01:22:06.006
Buck!

01:22:09.022 --> 01:22:10.742
Buck! Take that thing off.

01:22:11.516 --> 01:22:13.040
Can I keep it?

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.087
Breakfast is ready.
Well,  I'm starved.

01:22:22.794 --> 01:22:25.764
Elaine.   Do you think there are
still ghosts is this house?

01:22:25.964 --> 01:22:29.924
No.  The earthbound spirits
have been released.

01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:35.875
Don't you want your breakfast?

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:37.805
I'm guarding the money.

01:22:38.013 --> 01:22:39.912
Elaine?
Yes, Buck.

01:22:40.115 --> 01:22:42.606
You really are a witch, aren't you?

01:22:44.487 --> 01:22:48.354
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

01:22:48.724 --> 01:22:51.659
And the ghosts?  They haven't
really gone, have they?

01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:55.423
They'll be back.
They'll be back.

01:22:55.632 --> 01:22:57.395
Real soon, I hope.

01:23:56.465 --> 01:23:59.285
Now, just a moment before you leave!

01:23:59.454 --> 01:24:02.954
If any of you are not yet convinced
there really are ghosts...

01:24:02.973 --> 01:24:05.573
...take the supernatural viewer home with you.

01:24:05.644 --> 01:24:07.644
And tonight.... when you are alone...

01:24:08.231 --> 01:24:10.231
...and your room is in darkness...

01:24:10.929 --> 01:24:13.029
...look through the red part of the viewer.

01:24:13.252 --> 01:24:14.652
If you dare!
