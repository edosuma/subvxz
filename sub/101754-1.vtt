MUFFLED CRIES

01:58.531 --> 02:00.477
Mrs Christie.

02:02.252 --> 02:05.947
You look like my mum.
You shaved your moustache.

02:05.972 --> 02:08.347
Yeah. Distinguishable feature.

02:08.372 --> 02:11.917
You look like Mrs Danvers.
HE CHUCKLES

02:11.942 --> 02:15.386
That's not a good thing. She's
the housekeeper. I know she is.

02:22.012 --> 02:25.556
Is everything ready?
Tied up like a Nazi in a brothel.

02:27.172 --> 02:30.756
That's... not very reassuring.

02:30.781 --> 02:32.947
Plans haven't changed
since the last time we spoke,

02:32.972 --> 02:36.837
just as they hadn't changed
the time before that. Relax.

02:38.252 --> 02:40.947
The death of Poirot
won't be in vain.

02:45.892 --> 02:47.477
New man?

02:50.942 --> 02:53.837
Not so new. Faithful?

02:54.892 --> 02:56.756
Not so faithful.

02:58.862 --> 03:01.277
He knows which side
his bread's buttered.

03:02.862 --> 03:04.947
You've grown up.

03:06.092 --> 03:08.787
Yes. I like it.

03:08.812 --> 03:10.917
So do I.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.667
What about you?
ls the war good for business?

03:15.692 --> 03:19.556
HE SIGHS Terrible. Market's
flooded with amateurs.

03:20.692 --> 03:24.227
Well, we all make sacrifices. Not
all of us can sacrifice a few words

03:24.252 --> 03:26.756
for £20,000. 55,000.

03:28.092 --> 03:32.917
You said 20. Words. Words.

03:32.942 --> 03:34.987
SHE CHUCKLES

03:35.012 --> 03:37.787
Oh. Well, it's still
a healthy commission.

03:37.812 --> 03:40.707
And with the Inland Revenue
stalking me, I need every penny.

03:48.302 --> 03:50.277
Are you sure you wanna do this?

03:53.092 --> 03:55.197
Not really,
but I don't have a choice.

03:56.142 --> 03:58.306
I'm almost bankrupt.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.867
Those people
are most likely criminals.

04:03.372 --> 04:06.787
Well, that's why I've got you. Fine.

04:06.812 --> 04:10.117
But if I have to kill anyone, I want
danger money and my ten percent.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.556
Unless they're Canadian.

05:24.192 --> 05:27.717
Thank you.

05:33.832 --> 05:35.807
SHE KNOCKS ON DOOR

05:50.882 --> 05:52.967
THEY CHUCKLE

05:53.992 --> 05:56.967
Mr Lei would be grateful
if you could make every endeavour

05:56.992 --> 06:00.007
to look your best
whilst representing him.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.287
Hm.

07:34.882 --> 07:38.646
Not really. Would you like to hear
my opinion on Americans?

07:42.601 --> 07:45.446
Is there any nationality
you do tolerate?

07:47.162 --> 07:51.646
The Russians. You know
where you stand with the Russians.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.776
They tell you
before they stab you in the back.

07:54.801 --> 07:57.497
The Americans will stab you
in the back, watch you bleed out,

07:57.522 --> 08:01.247
and then offer to sell you
a funeral plan. You haven't changed.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.607
That's cos I was already perfect.

08:03.632 --> 08:06.337
Besides,
you can't trust people who do.

08:06.362 --> 08:08.526
Five minutes ago,
you said you liked it.

08:08.551 --> 08:12.446
When we first met,
you spent most of the time lying.

08:13.551 --> 08:17.696
Seems to rne you've stopped pretending to be
someone you're not. That isn't really change.

08:18.752 --> 08:21.007
Am I really that transparent?
I won't tell anyone.

08:21.032 --> 08:23.287
They might take advantage of it.

08:24.312 --> 08:26.137
I'd like to see them try.

08:50.192 --> 08:52.417
Mr Lei wishes to know,

08:52.442 --> 08:55.057
what do you do
when you're not protecting people?

08:56.082 --> 08:58.927
Hm.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.217
LIFT DINGS

09:50.072 --> 09:52.406
SHE CHUCKLES
He says...

09:53.512 --> 09:56.687
...Mrs Christie,
it is a pleasure to meet you.

09:58.072 --> 10:00.737
I have read every one of your books

10:00.762 --> 10:05.456
and believe you to be the finest
author of detective novels in the world.

10:05.481 --> 10:08.357
Oh. That's very kind of you.

10:09.592 --> 10:14.406
But I'm old enough and modest enough
to know that Conan Doyle is better.

10:15.762 --> 10:18.127
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

10:22.842 --> 10:25.487
Conan Doyle?
HE SPITS

10:26.762 --> 10:29.687
If anyone is Chungking Mansions

10:29.712 --> 10:33.456
is found reading Sherlock Holmes,
they're soon looking for a new home.

10:34.662 --> 10:39.456
I'm very happy to know that my hard work will
be in the hands of someone who appreciates it.

10:40.561 --> 10:43.567
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

10:49.072 --> 10:52.177
Have you got the money?

10:52.202 --> 10:58.047
In our culture, these proceedings
have certain... formalities.

10:59.152 --> 11:02.456
Well, in our culture, you have to pay
before you see the bearded woman.

11:04.592 --> 11:08.637
Mr Lei has £20,000
in his coat pocket.

11:08.662 --> 11:14.406
Mr Vella is here to ensure it remains
there until we have the manuscript.

11:15.481 --> 11:18.047
Sounds reasonable. And the deed.

11:20.561 --> 11:23.456
I'll sign it when I have the money.

11:24.632 --> 11:28.206
And then the manuscript
will be legally yours

11:28.231 --> 11:31.247
and you can do
whatever you want with it.

11:31.272 --> 11:32.847
Agreed.

11:33.942 --> 11:36.977
Let's seal this with a drink!
A soft one.

11:37.002 --> 11:39.497
You don't drink? No.

11:39.522 --> 11:42.336
Since when. Since forever.

11:42.361 --> 11:46.827
Ah. HE WHISTLES Oi! Four
zombies and a soda water.

11:46.852 --> 11:49.647
Assuming your wop likes
to stay sharp.

11:49.672 --> 11:52.466
Oh, you speak English. You drink?

11:55.522 --> 11:58.857
HE LAUGHS All right, well, I
don't know what a zombie is.

11:58.882 --> 12:00.977
You wanna see the cocktail menu?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.747
You're the first American I've met who
doesn't know how to make a zombie.

12:05.772 --> 12:09.416
How about I make the drinks
and you pay for them?

12:09.441 --> 12:13.336
AIR-RAID SIREN WAILS

12:13.361 --> 12:16.897
Perhaps now you'd like to hear about
our air raid procedures.

12:16.922 --> 12:18.986
DOOR SLAMS

12:29.371 --> 12:31.495
You need to pull yourself together.

12:33.041 --> 12:36.346
Do you know how many times
I've heard that siren? 96.

12:36.371 --> 12:39.576
Can you guess how many times
I've been blown up?

12:39.601 --> 12:43.175
I'm enjoying a civilised drink
in an uncivilised place.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.216
I couldn't care less if Hitler
was attacking on a fucking unicorn.

12:47.241 --> 12:49.706
Chin-chin.
SHE LAUGHS

12:49.731 --> 12:52.146
ls it possible it's a false alarm?

12:52.171 --> 12:55.656
Attacks this far out are unusual.

13:08.450 --> 13:15.096
Erm, we have a, er, shelter
in the ballroom. It's pretty strong.

13:21.631 --> 13:24.536
Well, it's just through there,

13:24.561 --> 13:29.016
along with the second largest
gramophone in London.

13:29.041 --> 13:32.375
You wanna see?

13:37.400 --> 13:40.576
It is against fire regulations

13:40.601 --> 13:42.896
to let the public go down there.

13:42.921 --> 13:45.295
How about if we're on fire?

14:10.210 --> 14:12.866
It's behind the bar,
down the stairs.

14:12.891 --> 14:15.226
You take me to all the best places,
darling.

14:22.101 --> 14:26.385
Or what?

14:31.251 --> 14:35.435
You may be invincible,
darling, but I'm not.

14:35.460 --> 14:37.106
Come on.

14:44.891 --> 14:47.226
Evening, ladies.

14:47.251 --> 14:49.716
What are nice girls like you
doing in a place like this?

14:49.741 --> 14:52.106
Sightseeing.

14:52.131 --> 14:54.716
It's a cheap time to visit London.

16:03.131 --> 16:05.385
HE WHISPERS

16:14.021 --> 16:16.746
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

16:25.561 --> 16:28.385
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

16:43.691 --> 16:45.996
Yes?

16:46.021 --> 16:48.826
What happens if we take it?

16:48.851 --> 16:51.226
I kill you.

16:51.251 --> 16:54.106
How?
By mangling the English language?

17:00.460 --> 17:03.586
You're supposed to be protecting me,
not starting a fight.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.786
Now we know what we're up against.

17:05.811 --> 17:08.946
How much for this '93 decant?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.635
We can't afford to let this
interfere with our plans.

17:16.051 --> 17:19.226
You really do need the money,
don't you? Yes.

17:20.251 --> 17:22.536
Well, we'd better get a move on.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.505
Our man's a little nervous.

17:27.741 --> 17:30.076
Don't worry. It's not as if...

17:30.101 --> 17:32.826
DISTANT EXPLOSIONS

17:37.171 --> 17:39.996
SHE PANTS

17:42.741 --> 17:46.425
Aren't they rather a long way off?

17:50.691 --> 17:54.635
How do you know?

17:55.660 --> 17:57.786
Did you see any markers?

18:01.660 --> 18:04.146
Something to suggest
that we're a target.

18:04.171 --> 18:06.356
Flares or fires?

18:06.381 --> 18:09.146
Anything that could be a guide
to the German bombers?

18:14.530 --> 18:18.425
Then hopefully Goering
will leave us alone.

18:19.450 --> 18:22.276
And if he doesn't, we're safe here.

18:23.941 --> 18:26.026
Think of all those poor people up...

18:34.200 --> 18:36.786
Your new man?

18:36.811 --> 18:38.466
Max.

18:40.051 --> 18:41.425
No.

18:43.051 --> 18:45.146
Here's hoping you change your mind.

18:50.410 --> 18:54.106
Max will be fine.
I've seen your house.

18:54.131 --> 18:56.866
It could take a direct hit,
I'd still struggle to break in.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.866
Also, think about it.

19:00.891 --> 19:05.356
They've dropped hundreds of thousands
of bombs and, what, killed ten people.

19:06.771 --> 19:10.175
Chances of Max going for a Burton
are about the same as me going straight.

19:18.171 --> 19:22.466
HE WHISTLES
COLONEL BOGEY MARCH

19:29.741 --> 19:34.146
# Goering has only got one ball

19:34.171 --> 19:38.505
# Hitler has plums so very small

19:38.530 --> 19:42.146
# Himmler's so fucking similar

19:42.171 --> 19:46.106
# And poor old Goebbels
has no balls at all

19:47.251 --> 19:51.226
# Hitler has only got one ball

20:03.301 --> 20:07.466
ALL: # She threw it
into the apple tree

20:07.491 --> 20:11.106
# It fell off into the deep blue sea

20:11.131 --> 20:14.786
# The fishes took out their dishes

20:14.811 --> 20:17.716
# And had scallops and bollock
for tea #

20:17.741 --> 20:20.666
HE CLAPS

20:20.691 --> 20:22.505
Thank you.

20:23.561 --> 20:26.816
Right, let's sell this bloody thing
and go home.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.146
Frankie!

20:32.171 --> 20:34.425
Maybe now is not the best time.

20:35.691 --> 20:37.816
You just need to be tactful.

20:39.971 --> 20:43.425
Maybe I'll be tactful
whilst you guard the manuscript.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.536
It's not going anywhere.

20:49.021 --> 20:52.746
Of course. But maybe I should...
Trust me?

21:00.301 --> 21:01.706
Ah!

21:12.481 --> 21:14.706
Would you mind opening this door?

21:17.530 --> 21:19.456
HE SHOUTS IN MANDARIN
Now!

21:22.481 --> 21:25.946
Enter this room,
I carve my name on your balls.

21:27.051 --> 21:31.106
Eli Sciacchitano.

21:31.131 --> 21:33.226
OK, there is a policewoman
over there.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.536
Until next time.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.106
Thank you.

22:05.481 --> 22:07.746
Just give him a moment.

22:13.711 --> 22:15.786
I need to show you something.

22:17.051 --> 22:19.536
Could you tell Mr Lei
I'll be back shortly?

22:19.561 --> 22:21.666
Yes, of course.

22:24.371 --> 22:26.456
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

22:30.121 --> 22:32.635
I took my eyes off it
for 30 seconds.

22:35.410 --> 22:38.425
That's my future. I thought
Mussolini was about to stab you.

22:40.811 --> 22:43.946
She left the oven on.
Did you see anyone near my bag?

22:45.200 --> 22:47.746
Something's missing? Our privacy.

22:52.841 --> 22:56.666
Since when did you start trusting
strangers with our business? I trusted you!

22:56.691 --> 23:00.916
I was making sure you didn't get perforated. I
wasn't in any danger! If you die, I don't get paid.

23:01.971 --> 23:05.066
If I don't sell the manuscript,
nobody gets paid.

23:05.091 --> 23:07.786
You do realise that ten percent
of nothing is nothing?

23:09.330 --> 23:11.456
I'm aware.

23:21.121 --> 23:23.816
At least we'll have this.

23:23.841 --> 23:27.026
It's stolen property. Mm.

23:27.051 --> 23:29.226
Or unfinished business.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.505
It can't have been taken on purpose.

23:36.530 --> 23:38.635
No-one knows.

23:41.371 --> 23:43.505
Should we leave?

23:45.221 --> 23:48.586
That's not like you.
I wasn't expecting trouble.

23:48.611 --> 23:52.555
I might have... exaggerated
my skills as a bodyguard.

23:55.301 --> 23:58.146
I might have downplayed
the importance of this deal.

23:59.251 --> 24:02.665
If I'd have known, I would've asked
for more money. SHE LAUGHS

24:04.540 --> 24:06.676
I can't believe I'm laughing.

24:11.021 --> 24:15.395
What do we do now? We find out who
has the manuscript and take it back.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.156
It could be anyone. Frankie might
have paid someone to steal it.

24:40.101 --> 24:43.106
Store room. Over there.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.565
Where do we start?

24:50.101 --> 24:52.676
By breaking your golden rule?

24:53.701 --> 24:56.076
Never rub another man's rhubarb?

24:56.101 --> 24:58.206
Your other one.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.236
Concerning the police.

25:02.231 --> 25:04.106
And keeping one's mouth shut.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.926
And I always thought
no-one ever listened to me.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.766
BOTTLES CLATTER

25:23.681 --> 25:26.766
Excuse me.

25:26.791 --> 25:29.375
My name is...

25:29.400 --> 25:32.836
I need to report a theft. Yes.

25:32.861 --> 25:38.656
Something important was stolen
out of my bag a few minutes ago.

25:38.681 --> 25:41.476
A manuscript.

25:46.071 --> 25:49.656
Are you looking for something? Perhaps
I can help. I'm good at finding things.

25:49.681 --> 25:52.375
It's been stolen.

25:53.711 --> 25:57.276
There's a reward.

25:58.370 --> 26:01.186
So it's your job
to investigate a crime.

26:04.791 --> 26:08.016
When?

26:08.041 --> 26:10.325
When everyone's left?

26:10.350 --> 26:12.806
Doing what?

26:14.501 --> 26:16.656
I'll make a deal with you.

26:20.270 --> 26:23.325
All you have to do
is stop people from leaving.

26:25.631 --> 26:28.886
Stop them from leaving
even if they choose to ignore it.

26:30.321 --> 26:32.406
And what?

26:33.400 --> 26:37.516
I thought you were a police officer.

26:43.431 --> 26:48.726
I won't write a bestselling series of
novels about an idiotic PC called O'Hanauer?

26:56.191 --> 26:59.526
I can do that.

27:15.820 --> 27:19.515
What happened?
She'll stop people from leaving.

27:20.670 --> 27:22.645
DOOR OPENS

27:32.790 --> 27:35.125
What now?

27:35.150 --> 27:37.615
We find out
if Frankie's behind all this.

27:39.540 --> 27:41.785
There's something funny
about those two.

27:43.510 --> 27:45.615
You noticed.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.565
Can't put my finger on it.
They're lying.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.404
Everyone's lying.

28:03.179 --> 28:06.255
Mrs Christie,
he is most happy to see you.

28:07.870 --> 28:10.125
My manuscript has been stolen.

28:12.030 --> 28:14.615
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

28:39.670 --> 28:41.795
Oh, sorry, where are my manners?

28:42.820 --> 28:45.125
Oh, no, thank you.

28:45.150 --> 28:49.045
Could you tell Mr Lei that whoever
took the manuscript is still here.

28:49.070 --> 28:52.204
We need to find out who so we can
conclude our business and go home.

28:53.349 --> 28:55.965
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

29:09.510 --> 29:11.435
HE SCREAMS

29:20.790 --> 29:24.435
Erm, we should... ask Rocco

29:24.460 --> 29:28.255
what he thinks would be the best way
to find the person responsible.

29:31.150 --> 29:33.765
You do?

29:52.070 --> 29:55.895
Erm... Mr Lei is not feeling well.

29:55.920 --> 29:59.074
Can we do anything?
No, I'll stay with him.

29:59.099 --> 30:01.615
I think he feels better
in this room.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.925
It makes him feel... Safe. Yes.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.074
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

30:21.429 --> 30:23.435
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

30:30.380 --> 30:33.404
She doesn't look like
she has anything good to steal.

30:34.530 --> 30:38.424
I'm about to win a particularly good
bottle of Taylor's.

30:39.690 --> 30:44.945
So would you mind fucking off?

30:44.970 --> 30:48.145
It's sir, actually.

30:55.610 --> 30:57.585
Bel insulto.

31:02.480 --> 31:04.275
AGATHA GASPS

31:11.610 --> 31:12.945
No!

31:20.400 --> 31:22.815
WOMAN SCREAMS

31:31.480 --> 31:33.705
Are you all right?

31:33.730 --> 31:35.705
HE GASPS

31:35.730 --> 31:38.815
HE CHOKES

31:38.840 --> 31:41.945
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

31:41.970 --> 31:44.145
Do something!

31:48.199 --> 31:50.375
HE GASPS

31:50.400 --> 31:52.915
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

31:54.650 --> 31:57.344
HE GROANS

31:57.369 --> 32:00.985
HE SPEAKS MAN DARI N

32:02.040 --> 32:05.505
What?

32:23.369 --> 32:27.585
HE GROANS Where in
God's name did you learn that?

32:27.610 --> 32:31.375
Get off him
and help me get him on his front.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.224
Move!
HE GROANS

32:42.890 --> 32:45.815
SHE SPEAKS MANDARIN

32:55.650 --> 32:59.985
When you've finished stuffing the Christmas
turkey, I think you'll find he's dead. Dead?

33:00.010 --> 33:04.224
Much like that servant. Grace has spent the last
few minutes trying to talk him back to life.

33:04.249 --> 33:08.195
Frankie!
JUN SPEAKS MANDARIN

33:08.220 --> 33:10.625
Keep going!

33:21.220 --> 33:24.094
He's dead.

33:24.119 --> 33:28.015
Have some respect!

33:36.840 --> 33:40.065
It was self-defence.

33:51.860 --> 33:56.145
We can't just leave him here.
No!

34:01.480 --> 34:05.145
Frankie! Oh, Frankie!

34:05.170 --> 34:07.455
SHE SOBS

34:24.879 --> 34:27.184
How could Frankie just die?

34:30.410 --> 34:33.625
He never had any...
any heart problems before?

34:33.650 --> 34:38.695
No. He was...
easily excitable, but...

34:40.360 --> 34:42.585
...no, he was in good health.

34:47.209 --> 34:49.775
I need to ask you something.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.415
What?

34:55.879 --> 34:59.665
Where's the money? The money?

35:00.690 --> 35:02.775
It's in his pocket.

35:05.009 --> 35:07.465
You think someone did this? Shh.

35:08.490 --> 35:10.875
It's possible we're being targeted.

35:10.900 --> 35:16.265
But the only people
that knew about it were you.

35:27.050 --> 35:29.984
We have to check
if Frankie still has the money.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.054
DOOR RATTLES
That's easier said than done.

35:37.290 --> 35:40.984
Second thoughts, leave that with me.

35:41.009 --> 35:45.234
HE CLICKS HIS FINGERS Got a
way for you to atone for your sins.

35:45.259 --> 35:48.825
Just promise you'll try
not to kill anyone else.

35:48.850 --> 35:51.625
Go talk to the policewoman.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.545
Trust me.
I'm gonna get you in that room.

36:00.650 --> 36:04.335
Hey, my ltalian's not up to much,
but Rocco tells me

36:04.360 --> 36:06.775
you're a stronzo?

36:06.800 --> 36:09.545
I think that means you're a fucker,
but I'm not really sure.

36:14.970 --> 36:17.695
I think two deaths in one night
is enough.

36:17.720 --> 36:21.515
Do you hear this? You hear what
this murdering pig is calling me?

36:22.970 --> 36:26.745
So if I am a stronzo...
..you are coward!

37:36.290 --> 37:39.625
The money's gone.
And I think he was poisoned.

37:43.129 --> 37:46.745
I assume whoever did it has
the manuscript. And needs the deed.

37:50.850 --> 37:57.025
My instinct says we can trust
jun, Rocco, Audrey and Nell.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.265
But my instinct when it comes
to trust is hugely wrong.

38:03.129 --> 38:06.945
How can we trust jun and Rocco? They're
the only ones that knew about the money.

38:09.249 --> 38:13.054
We should set a trap. Use the deed
to draw out whoever it is.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.665
And risk losing that, as well?

38:17.999 --> 38:22.224
How about I tell everyone I've heard the
all clear and see who makes a run for it?

38:22.249 --> 38:25.415
I imagine they all will.
Do you have a better plan?

38:28.129 --> 38:29.695
Yes.

38:31.970 --> 38:34.135
To not catch the killer.

38:35.290 --> 38:37.745
Do nothing? Not nothing.

38:37.770 --> 38:40.155
We find the manuscript and go home.

38:41.229 --> 38:43.635
We give up?

38:43.660 --> 38:46.244
No, not give up.

38:46.269 --> 38:50.124
We live to fight another day.
Sounds a lot like giving up.

38:51.950 --> 38:54.994
Oh, well, in for a penny,
in for a pound.

38:55.019 --> 38:57.435
You realise I have neither?
Then I'll take it on tick.

38:57.460 --> 39:00.605
Well, you'll be joining a long
queue. I know where you live.

39:03.070 --> 39:09.485
So... all we have to do is get the killer to
give you back the manuscript for no reason.

39:10.740 --> 39:15.045
Let me guess. You're gonna tell
everyone who you are and ask politely.

39:19.820 --> 39:22.244
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

39:22.269 --> 39:25.355
My name is Agatha Christie.

39:25.380 --> 39:27.685
I'm a novelist.

39:27.710 --> 39:31.885
Someone here has stolen
something very important to me.

39:31.910 --> 39:33.994
Please may I have it back.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.965
You're Agatha Christie?

39:39.019 --> 39:42.275
What's been stolen?
Clearly not a sense of humour.

39:44.349 --> 39:47.765
If she's Agatha Christie,
I'm the Emperor of Japan.

39:51.300 --> 39:54.324
I told you she looked familiar.

39:54.349 --> 39:56.204
Bollocks.

39:56.229 --> 40:00.525
What on earth would Agatha Christie
be doing here?

40:03.590 --> 40:06.845
I don't want your help,
I just want my manuscript back.

40:06.870 --> 40:10.204
Without... the deed...

40:11.430 --> 40:15.275
...you can't sell it. It's worthless.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.565
What's it about?

40:19.630 --> 40:22.324
Your missing novel.

40:22.349 --> 40:25.045
Someone who thinks
they can get away with murder.

40:26.229 --> 40:30.525
And it isn't missing.
It's been stolen.

40:31.550 --> 40:33.885
By one of you.

40:42.430 --> 40:44.925
What's the reward?

40:46.149 --> 40:50.685
If I find it? The reward...
is not going to prison.

40:55.019 --> 40:56.765
A grand.

40:56.790 --> 40:59.715
£1,000.

40:59.740 --> 41:02.405
That's what I said.

41:02.430 --> 41:04.685
Is that right, Miss Christie?

41:06.950 --> 41:10.045
How do I know you have £1,000?

41:10.070 --> 41:13.605
Her books sell like prophylactics
in a whore house.

41:14.630 --> 41:16.795
She's richer than the Queen.

41:36.380 --> 41:38.485
Well, that worked.

41:39.790 --> 41:43.074
I was hoping to reason with them.

41:44.190 --> 41:47.355
Not start a wild goose chase.
Better than nothing.

41:49.099 --> 41:51.635
And what if somebody
actually finds it?

41:52.660 --> 41:55.435
Where am I going to get £1,000?

41:55.460 --> 41:56.915
Hm.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.204
Didn't think of that.

42:01.229 --> 42:04.635
Tell you what, if I find it,
you can add it to my tab.

42:09.990 --> 42:11.885
Bollocks.

42:11.910 --> 42:14.074
Something wrong?

42:14.099 --> 42:17.635
It seems that telepathic ability
declines with age.

42:17.660 --> 42:21.435
Like most things.
Everything but one's sex life.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.485
Three of hearts.

42:23.510 --> 42:25.915
HE SIGHS
That's very unfortunate.

42:27.460 --> 42:29.915
Did you call the barman a deserter?

42:29.940 --> 42:32.074
Why else would a Canadian be here?

42:33.190 --> 42:37.485
I thought he was American. Only people with an
acute sense of hearing can tell the difference.

42:37.510 --> 42:42.845
Did you know that Canada
isn't actually a country?

42:42.870 --> 42:45.165
This is not it!

42:45.190 --> 42:47.685
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN
Gentlemen!

42:47.710 --> 42:49.845
As I was trying to say
to Mr Stabby here,

42:49.870 --> 42:52.324
this is sheet music

42:52.349 --> 42:57.635
for a number called... ooh, Tell The
Gardener I Am Ready To Be Watered.

42:57.660 --> 43:00.525
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

43:07.891 --> 43:11.506
Can I keep this?
It's a show I'd like to see.

43:17.611 --> 43:20.975
Jack of hearts.

43:22.171 --> 43:24.786
SHE GIGGLES
I'm so sorry, what were you saying?

43:24.811 --> 43:27.896
What right do you have to search
our personal possessions?

43:27.921 --> 43:30.466
It doesn't work like that.

43:30.491 --> 43:33.946
Do you like both your arms?

43:33.971 --> 43:37.416
I don't have a bag.
What are you going to do?

43:37.441 --> 43:39.746
See if I've stuffed it
down my knickers?

43:42.561 --> 43:45.746
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

44:02.263 --> 44:06.808
Maybe cos all the good ones are off fighting Germans.
I think this situation is getting out of control.

44:06.833 --> 44:09.478
Could I make a suggestion?

44:09.503 --> 44:13.647
That you only search items large
enough to contain my manuscript.

44:22.672 --> 44:24.928
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

44:49.623 --> 44:52.118
Hm?

45:12.783 --> 45:14.878
Yes!
SHE SIGHS

45:16.103 --> 45:18.798
HE SPEAKS ITALIAN

45:18.823 --> 45:22.397
It's all here. Do you think I would
be so stupid as to do that?

45:27.103 --> 45:29.567
You are being made a fool of.

45:46.183 --> 45:51.317
I'm happy you found it. But how do I
know you haven't stolen the money?

45:51.342 --> 45:53.678
That you haven't set
this whole thing up?

45:55.103 --> 45:58.598
I'm very sorry about Frankie. But...

46:00.033 --> 46:03.008
...there's no proof it was murder.
Ha!

46:03.033 --> 46:05.517
Perhaps all this was a coincidence.

46:07.513 --> 46:12.517
What, so somebody just chanced on
the £20,000 in Frankie's pocket?

46:12.542 --> 46:15.718
I have to go home to my husband.

46:15.743 --> 46:18.517
We're leaving.

46:22.383 --> 46:25.878
A heart attack and an accident
are not reasons to keep me here.

46:25.903 --> 46:30.488
If I want to risk getting blown up,
I will. We're leaving!

46:35.903 --> 46:40.437
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

47:08.433 --> 47:12.208
Did you hear about the grenadier who lost
the left side of his body in an explosion?

47:14.462 --> 47:16.567
He's all right now.

47:18.542 --> 47:21.488
MALCOLM CHUCKLES

47:23.023 --> 47:25.148
That's very good.

47:28.823 --> 47:30.798
My nephew...

47:31.953 --> 47:34.387
...has killed 37 German pilots.

47:35.462 --> 47:38.637
He was the worst mechanic
the Luftwaffe ever had.

47:39.662 --> 47:42.488
THEY LAUGH

47:45.023 --> 47:48.028
THEY LAUGH
That's pretty good, isn't it?

47:49.623 --> 47:53.317
Will you at least go and find out
if the air raid's over?

47:53.342 --> 47:56.078
We haven't heard anything
for a while.

47:56.103 --> 47:59.517
We'd all like to leave.

47:59.542 --> 48:03.798
It could be dangerous up there.
If you don't want to go, I will.

48:06.263 --> 48:08.668
I'll go with you.
It'll be quicker with two.

48:09.792 --> 48:12.278
Maltese Falcon
can be left in charge.

48:19.462 --> 48:22.408
DOOR RATTLES

48:41.802 --> 48:45.097
I know.
Mm.

48:45.122 --> 48:48.657
Absolutely not.

49:00.441 --> 49:02.937
I thought
she was going to shoot you.

49:02.962 --> 49:06.416
Oh, she was just trying to scare me.

49:09.212 --> 49:12.017
Have you ever had a gun
pointed at you before?

49:15.042 --> 49:17.907
Not with intent. Hm.

49:19.082 --> 49:24.017
Take it from me, your friend's joke
just saved your life.

49:35.150 --> 49:38.085
Well, at least you got
your manuscript back.

49:40.261 --> 49:42.846
While we wait...

49:42.871 --> 49:45.806
why not tell us the story?

49:49.181 --> 49:51.446
It's not.

49:52.591 --> 49:55.676
This one isn't.

50:00.061 --> 50:03.766
Why bother writing it, then? The
Americans stopped paying royalties

50:03.791 --> 50:07.516
and the Revenue think I'm a thief.
I need the money.

50:07.541 --> 50:09.236
Huh.

50:11.621 --> 50:13.846
I did a children's party once.

50:15.421 --> 50:19.125
A seven-year-old rode me like
a donkey into the swimming pool.

50:19.150 --> 50:21.286
You see, Grace? Bastard.

50:21.311 --> 50:23.396
You must care a little bit.

50:24.421 --> 50:28.846
You could've written about something
else.

50:28.871 --> 50:31.516
That would sell like hot cakes.

50:31.541 --> 50:34.926
And remind everyone
about our present horrors.

50:37.701 --> 50:41.036
I finished one of those last year.
It hasn't been published.

50:41.061 --> 50:44.156
They're worried it won't sell.
Why not test it on us?

50:44.181 --> 50:47.566
SHE SIGHS
I don't test my novels.

50:47.591 --> 50:50.396
A spy story makes sense.

50:50.421 --> 50:53.596
You must meet all sorts
of interesting people.

50:53.621 --> 50:57.036
You must know all sorts of secrets.

50:57.061 --> 51:01.596
The only secret I know is how to sell a
million books and not have any money.

51:02.751 --> 51:05.766
AIR-RAID SIREN WAILS

51:09.230 --> 51:12.236
Almost makes me wanna tell
the conscription board my real age.

51:12.261 --> 51:15.316
Would anyone like to play
yet more cards?

51:15.341 --> 51:17.926
Yes, please.

51:17.951 --> 51:21.726
How about a game of sharp?
Mm.

51:24.821 --> 51:26.926
Couldn't we just make a dash for it?

51:28.061 --> 51:31.726
Even if we escape the mad PC, it's
like an lrishman's wedding up there.

51:36.391 --> 51:39.446
Thank you. For what?

51:41.150 --> 51:46.396
I'm told you just saved my life.
Yeah. Gotta protect my investment.

51:47.980 --> 51:50.085
At this rate,
you won't get much of a return.

51:51.261 --> 51:53.366
You ever failed to get
what you want?

51:56.311 --> 52:00.085
I'm quite persistent.
Which is why I'm confident.

52:01.471 --> 52:04.566
You'll get your 20 grand,
I'll get my commission.

52:07.341 --> 52:11.205
We met for a few clays 14 years ago.

52:11.230 --> 52:13.446
I don't know anything about you.

52:14.751 --> 52:17.955
My story's different.
It's a potboiler.

52:19.150 --> 52:21.286
I do what I have to to survive.

52:22.341 --> 52:24.766
I've written a few potboilers.

52:24.791 --> 52:27.516
Do you know what defines them?

52:27.541 --> 52:29.766
They always make money.

52:33.541 --> 52:36.926
They never let you down.
Yeah, don't speak too soon.

52:46.591 --> 52:49.316
Don't worry. It's the Italian.

52:50.391 --> 52:52.566
The only people he can kill
are already dead.

52:53.621 --> 52:58.436
It isn't Eli.
It must be. He had the manuscript.

52:58.461 --> 53:01.125
When was the last time
you met someone

53:01.150 --> 53:03.846
who could write better English
than they spoke?

53:04.871 --> 53:06.396
Oh.

53:09.701 --> 53:11.796
Please don't lose it again.

53:13.511 --> 53:15.205
What are you doing?

53:30.541 --> 53:34.955
Does it occur to you that perfect spelling
and grammar might not be his strong point?

53:34.980 --> 53:37.955
She's smarter than us.

53:39.030 --> 53:43.955
If it is,
Eli didn't steal the manuscript

53:43.980 --> 53:46.085
and the murderer is free
to kill again.

54:00.900 --> 54:04.875
You said sleeping.
You said Eli was sleeping it off.

54:12.391 --> 54:13.926
Eli?

54:19.341 --> 54:21.125
Ohh!

54:27.821 --> 54:29.766
SHE GASPS
Oh, my...

54:32.851 --> 54:35.236
When you said you were gonna go
and check on the prisoner,

54:35.261 --> 54:38.286
did you mean the kind of check that
might spot he looked like King Harold?

54:38.311 --> 54:42.005
His head's been used
as a pin cushion.

54:42.030 --> 54:45.926
We should tell the others.

55:04.511 --> 55:08.706
You're going to go back out there

55:08.731 --> 55:11.875
and tell everyone what's happened.

55:11.900 --> 55:17.236
Once everybody's aware of the situation,
we'll wait for the all clear to sound.

55:17.261 --> 55:19.566
At that point,
you will go and get help.

55:24.230 --> 55:27.286
They're my words!

55:27.311 --> 55:29.676
I won't give them up to a murderer.

55:30.821 --> 55:32.926
Go check for clues or something.

55:34.030 --> 55:36.366
Piss off over there!

55:43.900 --> 55:46.286
As much as I hate to admit it,
she might be right.

55:46.311 --> 55:49.436
We could hand it over and go home.

55:49.461 --> 55:51.646
I can't give him up for nothing!

55:51.671 --> 55:55.075
Poirot? Perhaps you're more attached
to him than you admit. I'm not!

55:55.100 --> 55:58.646
I just have to get paid. He owes me.
He's not real!

56:02.230 --> 56:07.235
Is there anyone in your life who's been
around 20 years and not fucked you over?

56:11.601 --> 56:13.526
Come back.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.416
Time to start pretending
you're in charge.

56:20.471 --> 56:22.686
Don't think you'll find it too hard.

56:33.441 --> 56:37.696
Why?

56:37.721 --> 56:40.686
I wish to be on my own.
I will not leave Miss Yuhan.

56:40.711 --> 56:43.965
You'll want to hear this.
Rummy.

56:43.990 --> 56:46.215
You've got four kings? Mm.

56:48.191 --> 56:51.686
Where did you get these cards?
An Italian bugger.

56:51.711 --> 56:55.056
It's a miracle I won anything.

56:55.081 --> 56:57.416
Are we finally
being allowed to leave?

56:57.441 --> 57:01.135
Please don't tell me
you've allowed him to escape.

57:08.551 --> 57:13.296
I was looking forward to this mystery playing
out, but given the change of circumstances...

57:14.910 --> 57:17.696
...we're leaving.

57:17.721 --> 57:20.526
I've killed five people,

57:20.551 --> 57:22.814
three of them on purpose.

57:22.839 --> 57:27.093
My current duties allow me to shoot
first and ask questions never.

57:27.118 --> 57:29.894
Would you mind if I came with you?
More the merrier.

57:29.919 --> 57:36.204
Us, too. As the French might say as
they lay down their arms, fait accompli.

57:39.839 --> 57:43.173
You some sort of war hero?
I've had my moments.

57:44.279 --> 57:49.534
You're not a man that scares easy. Some people are
born without sexual organs. I was born without fear.

57:49.559 --> 57:53.764
So you wouldn't think twice about hunting down
the person that's caused us all this trouble.

57:53.789 --> 57:56.564
You can't hunt a ghost.
That's just what I was thinking.

57:57.998 --> 58:00.684
Anyone here believe in ghosts?

58:00.709 --> 58:05.043
I once saw the head of a Japanese
woman floating towards me.

58:05.068 --> 58:08.564
I was on the loo and...

58:08.589 --> 58:11.684
Well... two people
have been murdered.

58:13.198 --> 58:15.284
No-one's seen anything.

58:16.479 --> 58:19.534
So it must be a ghost.

58:19.559 --> 58:21.973
There's someone else here.
Of course.

58:21.998 --> 58:24.814
That does explain everything.

58:24.839 --> 58:28.173
Maybe. It's all rather frightening.

58:28.198 --> 58:30.814
What are we going to do?
Well, we've got two guns

58:30.839 --> 58:33.043
and a couple of killers.

58:33.068 --> 58:36.534
Seems to me we should find the
bastard and return the lady's money.

58:36.559 --> 58:39.734
We'll search room by room.

58:41.068 --> 58:44.764
I will come with you.

58:44.789 --> 58:48.014
I need your help.
I'll look after her.

58:48.039 --> 58:51.894
Given I'm the brains in this operation,
I should stay behind the front lines.

58:51.919 --> 58:56.324
Besides, someone needs to be here in case
our uninvited guest makes a run for it.

58:56.349 --> 58:58.564
I'm sure you know how to use this.

58:58.589 --> 59:01.124
If you don't go, I will.

59:04.198 --> 59:08.043
We'll start over there.
Why don't you accompany your gun?

59:08.068 --> 59:10.614
Scared?

59:10.639 --> 59:14.843
Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.

59:14.868 --> 59:17.534
I'm coming. Me, too.

59:18.839 --> 59:22.734
Stop. We need something
to protect ourselves.

59:26.559 --> 59:28.684
That's for you.

59:28.709 --> 59:30.654
And for you.

59:30.679 --> 59:33.254
And... yes.

59:34.309 --> 59:36.764
Mrs Christie.

59:36.789 --> 59:38.843
I think this one's yours.

59:38.868 --> 59:43.204
Oh! Thank you, my dear,
but I'd likely hurt myself.

59:43.229 --> 59:45.374
Very well.

59:48.639 --> 59:50.324
OK.

1:00:25.229 --> 1:00:29.014
No-one... make a sound.

1:01:05.318 --> 1:01:09.484
GUNSHOTS

1:01:11.629 --> 1:01:15.014
And now we have
the psychological advantage.

1:01:20.149 --> 1:01:23.963
Give me your gun.

1:01:23.988 --> 1:01:27.374
I always save the last one for myself.
Come on, hurry up, give it to me.

1:01:33.839 --> 1:01:35.923
Try not to die like a dog!

1:01:39.988 --> 1:01:43.734
We could always set fire to the furniture
and smoke him out. Or maybe he isn't here?

1:01:57.948 --> 1:02:00.124
He must be on the other side.

1:02:03.559 --> 1:02:08.454
We should go. Yes, yes, the others
might well be worried about us.

1:02:08.479 --> 1:02:10.454
SHE SCREAMS

1:02:17.649 --> 1:02:20.823
SHE SCREAMS

1:02:38.728 --> 1:02:40.703
Oh, God.

1:02:40.728 --> 1:02:43.033
He's alive.

1:02:56.489 --> 1:02:59.544
Trying to help you. Give me the gun.

1:02:59.569 --> 1:03:02.264
Who are you going to shoot?
You if you do not give me the gun.

1:03:02.289 --> 1:03:06.624
Revenge is a dish best served by professionals.
Give me the gun or I'll snap your neck!

1:03:06.649 --> 1:03:08.744
Don't you think it's time
you intervened?

1:03:11.089 --> 1:03:14.434
All I care about
is that no-one else gets hurt.

1:03:14.459 --> 1:03:16.624
I know you're investigating me.

1:03:16.649 --> 1:03:19.544
I'll do anything you want,
just help us!

1:03:21.899 --> 1:03:26.674
What are you suggesting?
Someone has to stop this madness!

1:03:28.009 --> 1:03:30.264
And then I can do
what the killer wants,

1:03:30.289 --> 1:03:35.184
deliver the deed and the manuscript. About
bloody time. I nearly died for 20 grand.

1:03:37.539 --> 1:03:39.953
Who in God's name are you?

1:03:39.978 --> 1:03:43.674
Someone who knows the palace relies
on you for their evacuation plans

1:03:43.699 --> 1:03:46.514
and will take a dim view of your
extra-curricular activities.

1:03:46.539 --> 1:03:48.953
We're being bombed, not invaded.

1:03:48.978 --> 1:03:51.153
Let's hope King George
feels like that

1:03:51.178 --> 1:03:53.514
and that the Germans
haven't landed at Ramsgate.

1:03:53.539 --> 1:03:57.264
Bertie's probably loaded for bears
and listening to jelly Roll Morton.

1:04:01.098 --> 1:04:06.023
Because if you don't, you'll spend the rest of
the war making furniture in an internment camp.

1:04:06.048 --> 1:04:09.314
HE GROANS
Are you all right?

1:04:10.739 --> 1:04:14.384
Have I died and gone to heaven?
SHE LAUGHS

1:04:14.409 --> 1:04:16.823
No!

1:04:16.848 --> 1:04:19.314
St Peter has standards.

1:04:20.409 --> 1:04:23.464
HE GROANS
No, don't move. No, I have to...

1:04:29.409 --> 1:04:33.953
I challenged her to a game of snap
and then... my world went dark.

1:04:36.209 --> 1:04:38.073
I'm sorry, I...

1:04:39.129 --> 1:04:43.434
I don't remember anything.

1:04:43.459 --> 1:04:45.544
You didn't kill anyone.

1:04:47.209 --> 1:04:50.953
Or murder anyone.

1:04:50.978 --> 1:04:54.823
He bloody well isn't.
We'll make sure of that.

1:04:56.209 --> 1:04:59.683
Before I deliver the manuscript,
will you check it's safe up there?

1:04:59.708 --> 1:05:02.794
I don't want to complicate things
by getting blown up.

1:05:02.819 --> 1:05:07.984
Yes. But also keen
not to make any further mistakes.

1:05:32.769 --> 1:05:36.624
Did you tell PC O'Hanauer how much
Frankie was paying for our manuscript?

1:05:36.649 --> 1:05:41.344
Of course I didn't. I don't thinkjun
would've said anything, or Rocco.

1:05:43.259 --> 1:05:45.514
You don't think...
SHE SIGHS

1:05:46.978 --> 1:05:51.514
Well, I don't know. She doesn't
come across as a master criminal.

1:05:52.739 --> 1:05:54.544
What are we gonna do?

1:05:56.409 --> 1:05:58.984
Tell the tax inspectors.
Tax inspectors my arse!

1:05:59.009 --> 1:06:01.234
Well, whoever does
the Revenue's dirty work.

1:06:01.259 --> 1:06:05.624
Either way, they're the closest thing we have to
authority. Unless they're trying to blackmail you.

1:06:07.289 --> 1:06:10.184
I trust them. What were you saying
about your trust issues?

1:06:10.209 --> 1:06:13.624
Well, we have to trust someone.
Yes. Each other.

1:06:15.838 --> 1:06:18.104
It's time for you to do
what you suggested.

1:06:19.209 --> 1:06:21.544
Give up the manuscript and the deed.

1:06:22.739 --> 1:06:26.354
Once we're out of here, someone
else can catch the killer and get it back.

1:06:26.379 --> 1:06:29.544
DOOR CLATTERS

1:06:29.569 --> 1:06:32.514
ls the air raid over?

1:06:32.539 --> 1:06:36.874
Didn't you hear anything?

1:06:36.899 --> 1:06:39.744
You certainly can't trust her.
I know.

1:06:40.848 --> 1:06:43.184
I've got a plan.

1:06:44.289 --> 1:06:47.874
I'm coming with you. Ohh.

1:06:47.899 --> 1:06:53.234
Or not.

1:06:54.459 --> 1:06:56.544
I'll come, too.

1:06:59.489 --> 1:07:02.464
Good. Cos it's not your decision.

1:07:11.369 --> 1:07:14.023
Well, in God's name,
find out if we can leave.

1:07:15.098 --> 1:07:16.384
Please.

1:07:53.009 --> 1:07:55.264
It must be over.

1:08:02.739 --> 1:08:04.514
Is something wrong?

1:08:12.259 --> 1:08:14.664
Checking nothing's on fire.

1:08:15.739 --> 1:08:18.514
Why not?

1:08:18.539 --> 1:08:22.264
What part of our previous
conversation do you not understand?

1:08:27.819 --> 1:08:29.594
Stop what?

1:08:37.009 --> 1:08:39.794
It's here.

1:08:39.819 --> 1:08:42.984
I intend to.
GUN COCKS

1:09:03.899 --> 1:09:08.183
You haven't thought this through.

1:09:12.499 --> 1:09:17.163
That's the problem.
If you shoot me, I can't sign it.

1:09:24.978 --> 1:09:28.833
Which is also not a great idea.

1:09:28.858 --> 1:09:32.314
If you shoot her,
we don't have a witness.

1:09:32.339 --> 1:09:34.804
My signature has to be witnessed.

1:09:43.389 --> 1:09:46.604
How so? With correct legal process?

1:09:56.779 --> 1:09:58.884
I know.

1:10:02.579 --> 1:10:05.033
So you keep saying.

1:10:05.058 --> 1:10:08.913
But it wouldn't make any sense.

1:10:48.139 --> 1:10:50.244
GUNSHOT

1:11:13.938 --> 1:11:16.033
Thought I'd missed.

1:11:36.419 --> 1:11:39.114
Are we safe? Yes.

1:11:40.619 --> 1:11:42.244
Oh.

1:11:45.029 --> 1:11:47.804
Did you... She...

1:11:48.829 --> 1:11:50.953
I told you it was her.

1:11:54.469 --> 1:11:57.833
The air raid? It's over.

1:11:59.469 --> 1:12:01.554
So we can leave.

1:12:09.389 --> 1:12:11.833
Then you owe me 50 quid and a gun.

1:12:29.188 --> 1:12:31.674
You got change of 1,000?

1:12:32.779 --> 1:12:34.884
I'm assuming you're good for it.

1:12:35.978 --> 1:12:39.083
He gave me 2-1 on dying.

1:12:39.108 --> 1:12:41.163
You bet against yourself?

1:12:41.188 --> 1:12:43.554
It was the best way of making sure
it didn't happen.

1:12:43.579 --> 1:12:45.724
You can send it to my barracks.

1:12:45.749 --> 1:12:47.833
Those two know the address.

1:12:50.419 --> 1:12:52.754
No-one's going to believe me.

1:12:55.308 --> 1:12:58.913
Come on, darling. Ad usum Delphini.

1:13:00.058 --> 1:13:02.474
Wonderful meeting you all.

1:13:02.499 --> 1:13:04.444
Huge fan.

1:13:05.499 --> 1:13:07.234
Toodle- loo.

1:13:09.499 --> 1:13:12.004
God, he is such a wanker.

1:13:13.339 --> 1:13:16.394
I quite like him. So what now?

1:13:37.029 --> 1:13:40.524
How much trouble am I in?

1:13:40.549 --> 1:13:43.724
Bletchley?

1:13:46.829 --> 1:13:50.194
You do?

1:13:57.619 --> 1:14:01.094
I thought you were
glorified tax inspectors.

1:14:07.469 --> 1:14:11.913
You're spies?

1:14:13.419 --> 1:14:16.194
And you think that...

1:14:16.219 --> 1:14:19.194
I'm in possession of state secrets?

1:14:22.499 --> 1:14:26.314
SHE LAUGHS
No! No! Good Lord!

1:14:29.389 --> 1:14:33.913
No, I have... I have absolutely
no idea what you're talking about.

1:14:43.699 --> 1:14:47.364
Can you take away my debt, placate
the IRS and the Inland Revenue,

1:14:47.389 --> 1:14:50.314
then force the Americans
to start paying my royalties again?

1:14:54.188 --> 1:14:57.114
All I'm trying to do
is earn a living.

1:14:57.139 --> 1:15:00.674
Whatever you think I've done,
I haven't.

1:15:02.139 --> 1:15:06.033
Everything that I've ever written
is just a figment of my imagination.

1:15:11.259 --> 1:15:14.004
Yes, it's a curse.

1:15:20.899 --> 1:15:24.644
Oh, well...
can I do anything to help?

1:15:45.709 --> 1:15:47.843
Aren't you forgetting something?

1:15:50.988 --> 1:15:52.484
Hm?

1:15:53.509 --> 1:15:56.374
The £20,000 in your pocket?

1:16:11.639 --> 1:16:13.574
Caught red-handed.

1:16:33.359 --> 1:16:35.183
Can I?

1:16:36.328 --> 1:16:38.414
Be my guest.

1:16:45.328 --> 1:16:49.053
Wiping gore off another man's face
doesn't break any wedding vows, you know?

1:16:52.719 --> 1:16:54.494
Thank you.

1:17:00.919 --> 1:17:03.574
You saved my life.

1:17:03.599 --> 1:17:05.024
Again.

1:17:12.108 --> 1:17:15.384
I'm going to do something in return.

1:17:22.239 --> 1:17:26.024
If I'm not mistaken,
Rocco's still downstairs.

1:17:27.559 --> 1:17:31.774
Yeah, er...
I think he's taken it badly.

1:17:31.799 --> 1:17:34.574
See if you can persuade him up here.

1:17:34.599 --> 1:17:36.824
We need a witness.

1:17:38.279 --> 1:17:39.923
For the deed.

1:17:44.689 --> 1:17:48.254
Once you've sold the manuscript,
you can give me a commission.

1:17:50.489 --> 1:17:53.973
Erm... I don't know what to say.

1:17:55.639 --> 1:17:57.853
Thank you?

1:17:59.049 --> 1:18:01.173
Thank you.
SHE LAUGHS

1:18:03.599 --> 1:18:06.494
Go on. Just hurry up.

1:18:06.519 --> 1:18:10.303
Our two spies won't be happy if
we're still here when the police arrive.

1:18:10.328 --> 1:18:12.664
And take that off.

1:18:12.689 --> 1:18:15.053
Rocco won't want to be reminded.

1:18:45.238 --> 1:18:47.013
Rocco?

1:18:56.678 --> 1:18:58.423
Rocco?

1:19:08.198 --> 1:19:10.783
Looking for you.

1:19:10.808 --> 1:19:12.653
What are you doing?

1:19:23.837 --> 1:19:25.453
Oh.

1:19:32.007 --> 1:19:33.852
It was that PC all along.

1:19:35.398 --> 1:19:38.703
Yeah.

1:19:43.198 --> 1:19:45.293
Body's upstairs.

1:19:46.448 --> 1:19:49.173
But we need to leave
before the real police arrive.

1:20:01.038 --> 1:20:03.213
That's a terrible idea.

1:20:03.238 --> 1:20:05.343
God knows what you'll be blamed for.

1:20:12.118 --> 1:20:15.703
What about the money?
Well, your money.

1:20:15.728 --> 1:20:17.812
Frankie's money.

1:20:23.198 --> 1:20:25.982
Well, someone needs to see
it goes to the right person.

1:20:27.757 --> 1:20:29.852
Maybe jun has a daughter.

1:20:41.558 --> 1:20:44.653
Sign on the line,
address and name underneath.

1:20:54.118 --> 1:20:55.812
Thank you.

1:21:36.757 --> 1:21:38.893
You're not having my bag.

1:21:40.398 --> 1:21:42.343
Just like that?

1:21:43.908 --> 1:21:45.812
Not quite.

1:21:50.198 --> 1:21:52.293
You were right.

1:21:54.877 --> 1:21:57.013
I've changed my mind.

1:21:58.087 --> 1:22:00.293
Hold that thought.
What are you doing?

1:22:00.318 --> 1:22:03.732
Well, if you're gonna start drinking, it'd
be a crime to open your account with that.

1:22:03.757 --> 1:22:05.852
See if you can find some soda water.

1:22:14.877 --> 1:22:16.812
Will this do?

1:22:33.318 --> 1:22:35.533
Hm.
SHE CHUCKLES

1:22:37.158 --> 1:22:39.932
It won't kill you. It might!
SHE CHUCKLES

1:22:39.957 --> 1:22:42.133
We all end up dead.

1:22:42.158 --> 1:22:45.133
It's just a question of how and why.
SHE SIGHS

1:22:45.158 --> 1:22:48.703
And whether we are drunk
at the time.

1:22:48.728 --> 1:22:50.883
GLASSES CLINK
BOTH: Cheers.

1:22:56.318 --> 1:22:58.213
Ohh.

1:22:59.368 --> 1:23:02.932
On second thoughts, I... I can't
break the habit of a lifetime.

1:23:02.957 --> 1:23:05.093
No, go on, come on.

1:23:06.368 --> 1:23:07.982
Sorry.

1:23:11.368 --> 1:23:13.533
I can't change your mind?

1:23:14.798 --> 1:23:16.883
You know how stubborn I am.

1:23:22.908 --> 1:23:25.013
Ain't that the truth?

1:23:34.118 --> 1:23:37.263
I understand the money
and the manuscript.

1:23:39.648 --> 1:23:41.883
Why do you want to kill me?

1:23:45.288 --> 1:23:48.932
Did I do something
all those years ago?

1:23:52.957 --> 1:23:55.883
Too clever for your own good.
ls that the point?

1:23:55.908 --> 1:23:58.013
You want to punish me?

1:23:59.518 --> 1:24:01.623
You think too much.

1:24:04.598 --> 1:24:07.932
What's more valuable
than the last ever Poirot novel?

1:24:10.518 --> 1:24:12.623
It's your last ever book.

1:24:21.818 --> 1:24:23.723
Was it the fingerprint?

1:24:26.027 --> 1:24:28.363
I decided last minute
to write you that message.

1:24:29.418 --> 1:24:32.033
Before you gave the envelope
to PC O'Hanauer.

1:24:40.897 --> 1:24:43.393
She really is a copper, you know?

1:24:43.418 --> 1:24:46.033
I wondered.

1:24:46.058 --> 1:24:50.193
Nicked me for looting,
but... easily corruptible.

1:24:51.568 --> 1:24:54.153
Well, she must have trusted you. Mm.

1:24:56.058 --> 1:24:58.153
She loved me.

1:25:01.178 --> 1:25:03.283
People are stupid.

1:25:05.458 --> 1:25:07.433
Up to a point.

1:25:12.258 --> 1:25:14.233
HE GROANS

1:25:16.027 --> 1:25:19.832
Once I'd acknowledged the awful possibility
that you'd planned the whole thing...

1:25:20.857 --> 1:25:22.952
...the truth was quick to unravel.

1:25:24.027 --> 1:25:26.473
Even then, I wanted you
to come up those stairs...

1:25:26.498 --> 1:25:29.513
What have you done? Ohh.
..and prove me wrong.

1:25:29.538 --> 1:25:31.903
Two pockets, two flasks.

1:25:33.388 --> 1:25:37.233
I just swapped them. Agh.
After you poisoned Frankie,

1:25:37.258 --> 1:25:39.832
you made a show
of offering us a drink.

1:25:39.857 --> 1:25:43.283
Like the writing in the blood,
you wanted to be clever.

1:25:45.338 --> 1:25:47.832
You over-thought it.
HE COUGHS

1:25:49.138 --> 1:25:52.433
Your insecurities undid you.
HE COUGHS

1:25:54.458 --> 1:25:56.593
Like all of us.

1:25:56.618 --> 1:25:58.593
HE COUGHS

1:26:05.058 --> 1:26:08.233
HE GASPS AND MOANS

1:26:27.948 --> 1:26:31.593
AIR-RAID SIREN WAILS

1:26:33.138 --> 1:26:36.002
HE GROANS AND COUGHS

1:26:47.097 --> 1:26:49.233
I'm sorry.

1:26:52.847 --> 1:26:54.952
I don't believe you.

1:27:04.618 --> 1:27:06.593
SHE WEEPS

1:27:18.458 --> 1:27:21.002
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

1:27:44.538 --> 1:27:46.793
I don't know what I was thinking.

1:27:51.097 --> 1:27:55.233
How could I kill the only thing
in life I can truly rely upon?
