00:15.250 --> 00:16.791
<i>- Can I trust you?
- Of course.</i>

00:16.791 --> 00:18.083
<i>Can I trust you?</i>

00:18.083 --> 00:20.166
<i>Always.</i>

00:23.375 --> 00:25.291
<i>For a century, you lot
thought you were creating</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:26.333
<i>a new order.</i>

00:26.333 --> 00:28.208
But spies cannot be saints.

00:28.208 --> 00:31.208
And your code isn't one that
bettered you but blinded you

00:31.208 --> 00:34.000
to the horrors Citadel imparted.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.666
I'm bringing a new Tier-One
to the team.

00:38.666 --> 00:40.541
I trust her with my life.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.916
<i>She saved it once.</i>

00:44.500 --> 00:45.750
Brielle is still alive.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.166
What?

00:47.916 --> 00:49.333
<i>What did Nadia teach you</i>

00:49.333 --> 00:50.791
over in Bravo
about going undercover?

00:50.791 --> 00:52.041
<i>She taught me</i>

00:52.041 --> 00:53.791
<i>that the key to being undercover
is learning</i>

00:53.791 --> 00:54.916
<i>how to maintain the lie.</i>

00:54.916 --> 00:56.125
<i>Mm.</i>

00:56.125 --> 00:57.375
<i>Celeste is in over her head.</i>

00:57.375 --> 00:59.000
<i>She's been docked
for three months.</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:01.083
You're seeing things
that aren't there, Mason.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.458
I know she's your friend.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.166
<i>But if anyone
gets their hands on the Oz Key,</i>

01:04.166 --> 01:06.250
<i>any chance of holding them
at bay, any chance of keeping</i>

01:06.250 --> 01:08.166
<i>their power in check is gone.</i>

01:13.791 --> 01:15.375
<i>What did you do
with the Oz Key, Celeste?</i>

01:15.375 --> 01:17.333
I told you, it was in my go bag.

01:17.333 --> 01:20.041
Your go bag was empty.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.541
You want to be known
as the director who let a mole

01:21.541 --> 01:23.000
take down the agency?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.208
So, what do we do?

01:24.208 --> 01:25.583
We backstop her.

01:25.583 --> 01:26.875
No one needs to know.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.666
Not Nadia, not Command.

01:28.666 --> 01:32.125
- <i>No one.</i>
- Seven, six...

01:32.125 --> 01:34.875
<i>You are
protecting Nadia.</i>

01:34.875 --> 01:37.041
<i>Because even though
you love her,</i>

01:37.041 --> 01:40.333
you think Nadia might be a mole.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.541
You did this.

01:42.541 --> 01:43.541
What did I do?

01:43.541 --> 01:44.583
Not you.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.166
Her.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.708
You can't trust her.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.208

04:39.833 --> 04:41.458
Whew.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.250
What if it is real?

04:54.291 --> 04:56.833
What if it's not from Bernard?

05:02.583 --> 05:04.875
Are you fucking with me
right now?

05:10.916 --> 05:13.750
Is this some part

05:13.750 --> 05:15.833

07:10.291 --> 07:12.125
It's not real.

07:12.125 --> 07:14.125
- It's her, Anders.
- But she's not... It's...

07:14.125 --> 07:16.333
It's her.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.250
I can take you to her.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.250
You lost her once.

07:23.250 --> 07:25.125
Do you really want
to lose her again?

07:35.000 --> 07:36.458
I'm going to cut you loose.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.291
I got a car around back.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.750
You stay behind me, okay?

08:02.333 --> 08:04.541
You fucking bitch.

08:30.458 --> 08:33.666
You dipshit.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.916
Did you get blood on your shoes?

08:40.583 --> 08:43.291
You always had a gift
of a silver tongue, Bernard.

08:43.291 --> 08:47.416
I admired you
for creating a safer world.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.958
Until I found out firsthand

08:51.958 --> 08:54.125
that the most dangerous
weapon of all

08:54.125 --> 08:57.791
wasn't nuclear arms
or biological weapons.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.333
It was Citadel.

09:06.291 --> 09:11.833
Thomas would be so ashamed
of what you've become.

09:20.541 --> 09:22.916
You're not fit
to speak his name.

09:22.916 --> 09:25.708
This is his legacy
as much as it is mine.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.666
Disarmament.

09:27.666 --> 09:31.666
You killed all of those agents.

09:31.666 --> 09:35.041
- Mm.
- You killed thousands.

09:35.041 --> 09:38.458
Murderers, war criminals, spies.

09:38.458 --> 09:40.958
And I would do it every day

09:40.958 --> 09:43.041
if it means protecting
innocent people

09:43.041 --> 09:47.000
from losing the ones they loved,
like I did.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.041
But I can't take all the credit.

09:51.333 --> 09:55.291
It was one of your own
who came to me.

09:55.291 --> 09:58.125
Hurt and lied to.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.458
A Citadel spy

10:02.458 --> 10:07.708
who finally saw
the truth of the agency...

10:07.708 --> 10:10.500
and betrayed you all.

10:41.291 --> 10:43.666
Just one sec. One sec.

10:52.541 --> 10:54.375
How about now?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.125
Yeah. Now's good.

11:00.458 --> 11:02.666
You're gonna answer
one question.

11:04.041 --> 11:05.750
Did he know?

11:16.625 --> 11:18.083
Should we bring her back
from Farmington?

11:18.083 --> 11:20.583
I'm sure she's happy
for the time off.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.625
<i>Nadia thinks a great spy
has to be a great liar.</i>

11:26.625 --> 11:29.208
<i>A great spy needs
to tell the truth.</i>

11:46.125 --> 11:48.250
Ordered you a Riesling.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.958
You shouldn't have.

11:57.333 --> 11:59.583
Bernard backstopped Celeste.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.166
What?

12:05.958 --> 12:07.375
Did you know?

12:08.458 --> 12:10.083
No.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.583
No.

12:17.416 --> 12:19.500
How could you, Mason?

12:27.958 --> 12:29.291
I'm sorry.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.833
How could you do that to her?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.041
I did it for you,
to protect you.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.541
From what?

12:37.041 --> 12:39.041
I know you took the Oz Key.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.583
Now, Mason...

12:44.583 --> 12:46.833
And I have never asked
what you did with it

12:46.833 --> 12:48.958
or who you sold it to
or who you're working for.

12:48.958 --> 12:50.958
Why didn't you just ask me?

12:52.291 --> 12:53.416
Why?

12:53.416 --> 12:55.708
Because I didn't want to know.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.166
I didn't want to know the truth.

12:58.166 --> 12:59.791
'Cause if I knew the truth,

12:59.791 --> 13:01.875
I'm scared of what
I'd have to do to you.

13:03.208 --> 13:06.291
I've lost everything I've ever
cared about. I won't lose you.

13:08.083 --> 13:11.000
If you'd asked me,
I would have told you the truth.

13:17.541 --> 13:19.916
You did take it.

13:26.208 --> 13:27.666
So, did you turn?

13:29.000 --> 13:30.541
Are you a mole?

13:30.541 --> 13:31.833
This a lie? Us?

13:31.833 --> 13:33.125
Why don't you tell me, Mason?

13:33.125 --> 13:34.500
What did you do with it?

13:34.500 --> 13:36.958
What do you think I did with it?
I destroyed it.

13:40.416 --> 13:43.875
No one can be trusted
with that kind of power.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.083
Not the Silje brothers,
not the Zani family,

13:46.083 --> 13:48.125
not even Citadel.

13:48.125 --> 13:51.125
Now, reactivate her.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.500
I can't.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.208
Mason, call Bernard

13:54.208 --> 13:56.208
and reactivate
Celeste's memories.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.958
- Please.
- I wiped them from the system.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.583
What?

14:01.916 --> 14:04.250
For you, so the blame
would stay with her.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.250
So you just killed
the person that she was?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.583
To protect you
because I love you.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.625
You don't love me.

14:12.625 --> 14:14.916
If you think I needed you
to do that for me,

14:14.916 --> 14:16.625
you don't know me at all.

14:16.625 --> 14:17.708
How could I?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.541
You never gave me the chance.

14:20.541 --> 14:22.416
I have given this everything.

14:22.416 --> 14:25.208
I literally walked in here
and gave you the opportunity

14:25.208 --> 14:27.208
to tell me the truth.

14:32.208 --> 14:35.125
No, this isn't
about Celeste, is it?

14:35.125 --> 14:37.916
Or what I did.

14:37.916 --> 14:40.000
You were always looking
for a reason to leave.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.208
Oh, that's some bullshit.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.916
You always wanted
a way to end this.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.750
To walk out,

14:44.750 --> 14:46.708
conscience clean, pin it on me,

14:46.708 --> 14:48.625
- make it my fault.
- It is your fault.

14:48.625 --> 14:50.541
Eat your fucking salad!

14:53.666 --> 14:55.958
You know how I ended up a spy?

14:55.958 --> 14:58.166
I was five years old,
and my dad died,

14:58.166 --> 15:00.708
and my mom left
like I didn't exist.

15:01.916 --> 15:03.916
Now, Citadel gave me
an identity.

15:03.916 --> 15:05.750
Not existing was an asset.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.666
They saw me.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.916
Then I met you...
and I knew who I was.

15:14.833 --> 15:17.375
You already knew who you were.

15:17.375 --> 15:21.250
You had a mom and a dad
and a life.

15:24.458 --> 15:28.125
You became a spy
so you could hide.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.125
What am I hiding from, Mason?

15:31.125 --> 15:32.916
From yourself.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.750
So you never have to show
your real self to anyone.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.291
And I don't know why.

15:42.291 --> 15:44.291
I don't know why
you're so fucking terrified

15:44.291 --> 15:45.916
of being seen.

15:48.791 --> 15:52.125
You once asked me,
"Can you ever truly love a spy?"

15:54.125 --> 15:57.208
The question is:
"Can a spy ever truly love?"

16:00.083 --> 16:01.750
And I can.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.375
Can you?

16:16.250 --> 16:18.375
I can, Mason.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.166
I just can't love you.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.791
Goodbye, Mason.

17:07.250 --> 17:09.000
<i>[over phone] This is
a surprise.</i>

17:09.000 --> 17:10.583
Something's happened.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.125
<i>What?</i>

17:20.791 --> 17:23.083
You made
the right choice calling me.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.375
Let's get you to Valencia.

17:27.791 --> 17:29.791
Preparations are in place.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.750
I'll be waiting for you.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.083
If anyone can do it,
it's Rahi Gambhir.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.875
Thank you.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.916
I still have
some loose ends to tie up.

17:43.916 --> 17:45.750
Okay.

17:45.750 --> 17:46.875
If you're there much longer,

17:46.875 --> 17:48.583
they'll discover
the truth about you.

17:48.583 --> 17:50.875
Whatever you need to finish
at Citadel, do it fast.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.500
Don't worry.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.125
No one suspects a thing.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.083
And by the time
they figure it out,

17:56.083 --> 17:58.416
I'll be long off the grid.

17:58.416 --> 18:00.416
But when that day comes,

18:00.416 --> 18:04.916
when you turn your back on
Citadel, the question remains:

18:04.916 --> 18:07.625
What are you going to do
about Kane?

18:10.125 --> 18:12.041
Mason can never find out.

18:14.083 --> 18:15.916
You understand that?

18:25.958 --> 18:28.625
You can't trust her.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.125
Why not?

18:31.166 --> 18:32.750
Carter.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.291
Why can't I trust her?

18:36.291 --> 18:38.833
You were working with Manticore.

18:40.833 --> 18:45.458
You were with a known terrorist,
Rahi Gambhir,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.083
just days before Citadel fell.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.375
Shit.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.458
Okay, we got to go now.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.125
Kyle!

19:00.125 --> 19:02.083
You want to save your family?

19:02.083 --> 19:04.375
I suggest we get the fuck
out of here.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.250
We've run out of time,
and I've run out of patience.

19:21.250 --> 19:24.000
I need the codes for the nukes.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.916
We're getting close
to your family, Bernard.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.875
We'll drop a cluster bomb
like old times, right?

19:34.875 --> 19:36.166
What do you say?

19:36.166 --> 19:39.708
If you touch one hair
on their fucking heads...

19:39.708 --> 19:41.208
Get me confirmation on target.

19:41.208 --> 19:42.250
I need confirmation.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.791
Dahlia.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.250
<i>[over radio] Target
coordinates confirmed.</i>

19:45.250 --> 19:46.333
Don't do this.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.375
Initialize launch.

19:48.375 --> 19:49.500
Initializing launch.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.041
Dahlia, there are kids in there.

19:51.041 --> 19:53.375
Didn't stop Citadel in Belgrade.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.875
Please.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.583
[chuckling] Please?

19:56.583 --> 19:58.000
Please?

19:59.500 --> 20:01.708
<i>Do I have
permission to execute?</i>

20:06.583 --> 20:07.625
Ma'am?

20:10.791 --> 20:12.125
Do it.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.958
Okay. Okay.

20:14.958 --> 20:16.958
I'll give it to you.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.000
You see?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.250
That wasn't so hard, was it?

20:25.833 --> 20:28.500
GXZ-33...

20:28.500 --> 20:32.166
E5A42-9VCC...

20:32.166 --> 20:34.625
18288.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.125
Okay?

20:36.125 --> 20:38.583
We're all just trying
to make the world

20:38.583 --> 20:41.958
a safer place
for our children, aren't we?

20:43.000 --> 20:45.666
Let the families know
we'll launch tomorrow.

20:45.666 --> 20:48.750
Catalog the location
of all Russian smart subs,

20:48.750 --> 20:50.875
nuclear grade.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.833
And... clean up in Wyoming.

20:53.833 --> 20:55.666
No loose ends.

20:55.666 --> 20:57.250
Dahlia.

20:57.250 --> 21:00.166
Don't fucking do this. Don't.

21:00.166 --> 21:02.750
It's just an eye for an eye, Bernard.

21:02.750 --> 21:05.916
For what you people did to me.

21:05.916 --> 21:08.666
I mean...

21:08.666 --> 21:11.833
it's only fair, right?

21:13.000 --> 21:14.666
- Dahlia?
- Get him to Brazil.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.666
We have big plans for him.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.916
Dahlia!

21:18.958 --> 21:20.666
Dahlia!

21:32.166 --> 21:33.583
<i>Circling back.</i>

21:33.583 --> 21:34.916
<i>Reengaging target.</i>

21:43.958 --> 21:45.375
Mom!

21:49.416 --> 21:51.291
- We got to go.
- What?

21:51.291 --> 21:52.541
They found us.

21:55.375 --> 21:56.750
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

21:58.958 --> 22:00.500
We're on the move!

22:00.500 --> 22:02.500
Val, grab your dad's case.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.416
Let's move it!

22:05.500 --> 22:07.083
Come on.

22:26.541 --> 22:28.083
Yes?

22:28.083 --> 22:30.666
<i>[over phone] The Fez
black site was breached.</i>

22:30.666 --> 22:33.458
<i>Kane and Nadia Sinh took Carter.</i>

22:33.458 --> 22:35.375
<i>They're fleeing the country.</i>

22:36.416 --> 22:38.791
<i>Activate Yamazaki.
He's in Casablanca.</i>

22:38.791 --> 22:42.083
<i>We need to find them, whatever
it takes. We can't lose him.</i>

22:42.083 --> 22:44.000
<i>We have the location
of the nukes.</i>

22:44.000 --> 22:47.208
- <i>Now we just need Mason Kane.</i>
- Understood, ma'am.

22:47.208 --> 22:49.541
<i>And, Davik, I need you
to go to Valencia.</i>

22:49.541 --> 22:52.541
We intercepted a communiqué
between Nadia Sinh

22:52.541 --> 22:56.083
and Rahi Gambhir yesterday.

22:56.083 --> 22:59.250
There's a chess piece I think
he's been holding for her.

22:59.250 --> 23:01.416
<i>Let me know the minute
you have it in possession.</i>

23:01.416 --> 23:02.916
We'll do what we can.

23:02.916 --> 23:05.375
- <i>Oh, and, Davik?</i>
- Yeah.

23:05.375 --> 23:07.375
<i>Your brother was killed.</i>

23:07.375 --> 23:10.208
<i>Bernard Orlick got free
and shot him dead</i>

23:10.208 --> 23:13.000
<i>before we could
restrain him, so...</i>

23:13.000 --> 23:15.583
<i>let's finish this, hmm?</i>

23:15.583 --> 23:17.416
<i>For Anders.</i>

23:18.875 --> 23:20.791
Yes, ma'am.

23:43.583 --> 23:45.500
I don't know
who you are anymore.

23:45.500 --> 23:47.375
I'm the person trying
to keep us alive.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.666
Fucking insurgent. I know that.

23:48.666 --> 23:50.083
Balduino, Carter,
my own two eyes.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.583
You're hiding something.

23:51.583 --> 23:52.833
Stop the car.

23:52.833 --> 23:56.083
<i>Stop the fucking car.</i>

23:57.416 --> 24:00.458
None of us are as clean as we
want to be, and you know that.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.208
And you, you're gonna open me up
after what you did to Celeste?

24:10.250 --> 24:13.083
He may not remember, but I do.

24:15.333 --> 24:16.250
You don't get to say that.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.958
Everyone thought Celeste was
a double agent, but I knew...

24:21.958 --> 24:23.166
I knew it was you.

24:23.166 --> 24:24.708
You're wrong!

24:24.708 --> 24:25.833
Is he?

24:31.166 --> 24:35.583
A year before
Citadel fell, you left Tier-One.

24:35.583 --> 24:37.625
You disappeared.

24:37.625 --> 24:40.541
Mason found out you were
in Valencia, off-grid,

24:40.541 --> 24:42.166
with Rahi Gambhir.

24:42.166 --> 24:44.375
You two were working
for Manticore.

24:46.166 --> 24:49.583
You planned the attack
against Citadel, didn't you?

24:51.625 --> 24:53.625
I lied to you.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.958
You don't know
what you're asking.

24:56.958 --> 24:58.625
- You were
working against us then.
- Nadia?

24:58.625 --> 25:00.125
You're working against us now!

25:00.125 --> 25:01.541
What's in Valencia?

25:01.541 --> 25:03.458
- I need to tell you something.
- <i>Nadia?</i>

25:03.458 --> 25:05.333
What was in Valencia?

25:06.791 --> 25:08.625
I have a daughter.

25:16.750 --> 25:19.375
I'm not a fucking insurgent.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.833
I had a child,
and I had to keep her a secret

25:21.833 --> 25:24.333
because that was
the only way to keep her safe.

25:30.541 --> 25:32.458
<i>[over phone] This is
a surprise.</i>

25:32.458 --> 25:34.791
- Something's happened.
- <i>What?</i>

25:35.833 --> 25:37.666
I'm pregnant.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.708
<i>Nadia.</i>

25:43.000 --> 25:44.666
I need to get out.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.625
<i>Does Mason know?</i>

25:49.750 --> 25:51.166
No.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.208
And he doesn't need to.

25:56.416 --> 25:58.333
I don't trust him.

26:02.083 --> 26:04.083
<i>You made
the right choice calling me.</i>

26:18.041 --> 26:20.833
She's
dilated. There's a lot of blood.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.000
We need to get her
to a hospital.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.500
No! No hospitals.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.541
Please, we need you
to help us. Here.

26:52.541 --> 26:55.458
And I haven't seen her
since she was six months old,

26:55.458 --> 26:57.541
eight years ago.

27:04.083 --> 27:05.500
Is she...?

27:10.041 --> 27:11.875
Yes.

27:13.458 --> 27:15.625
Did I know?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.708
No.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.208
Why not?

27:19.208 --> 27:21.583
Because you didn't
deserve to know.

27:37.916 --> 27:40.083
We have a daughter?

27:40.083 --> 27:41.833
Yes.

27:43.041 --> 27:44.750
All this time?

27:47.958 --> 27:50.666
It was the hardest decision
I've ever had to make.

28:03.791 --> 28:05.541
<i>How was your trip in?</i>

28:05.541 --> 28:07.166
<i>Quick.</i>

28:09.541 --> 28:10.958
<i>The families have long been</i>

28:10.958 --> 28:14.000
<i>skeptical of you, and yet...</i>

28:14.000 --> 28:16.416
my family is pleased.

28:16.416 --> 28:17.875
As are the others.

28:17.875 --> 28:21.333
The Zanis commend you,
as does Guru.

28:22.375 --> 28:25.083
You've bought yourself
some much-needed goodwill.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.875
I thought you'd be pleased.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.333
- <i>[over phone] Ma'am?</i>
- Is it done?

28:31.333 --> 28:33.833
<i>We've interrupted Russia's
tracking of its Dead Hand sub.</i>

28:33.833 --> 28:35.708
<i>We're free and clear to execute.</i>

28:35.708 --> 28:36.916
Brilliant.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.375
<i>But we can't access it.</i>

28:39.375 --> 28:42.500
No, I know.
There's an override to the code,

28:42.500 --> 28:47.250
linked to a sole biometric print
from a mission years ago.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.083
Only Mason Kane has access
to those nukes.

28:55.041 --> 28:57.125
Who has she been with?

29:04.291 --> 29:06.000
Rahi Gambhir, right?

29:10.208 --> 29:12.666
He's a criminal, a terrorist.

29:12.666 --> 29:15.041
He's my father.

29:35.958 --> 29:37.583
It's Grace.

29:40.041 --> 29:41.500
<i>Italy?</i>

29:41.500 --> 29:43.083
You can't go to Italy.

29:43.083 --> 29:44.791
I have to.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.208
I told her I'd go.

29:49.625 --> 29:51.583
Why did you say yes?

29:54.708 --> 29:56.500
He deserves to know.

29:57.916 --> 30:00.541
He deserves to at least
know about her.

30:02.416 --> 30:04.583
If I don't tell him,

30:04.583 --> 30:06.625
aren't I just like him?

30:11.333 --> 30:14.250
Look, you both
will be fine together,

30:14.250 --> 30:16.750
and I'll be back in six weeks.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.666
Thank you.

30:23.625 --> 30:25.791
<i>Mommy has to go away
for a while.</i>

30:27.416 --> 30:28.416
<i>But you'll be safe here...</i>

30:29.458 --> 30:31.208
...with Nana.

30:31.208 --> 30:34.541
This is gonna help protect you.

30:36.875 --> 30:38.875
And I'll be watching.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.458
Mommy loves you, Asha.

30:49.666 --> 30:52.208
I'll be back soon.

31:15.458 --> 31:17.875
You'll want to put those down.

31:17.875 --> 31:19.833
Why don't you tell that
to your guys?

31:22.958 --> 31:24.375
Mr. Conroy.

31:26.416 --> 31:29.541
I have someone
who would like a word with you.

31:30.583 --> 31:32.375
What is that?

31:32.375 --> 31:34.083
It's a secure line
for communication.

31:34.083 --> 31:35.708
The piece goes in your ear.

31:38.083 --> 31:40.250
I promise you, no harm will come

31:40.250 --> 31:42.375
to either you
or your associates.

32:12.708 --> 32:14.208
Hello?

32:15.833 --> 32:18.000
Kyle Conroy.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.458
I've been anxious to speak
with you for a very long time.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.916
<i>I have a proposition for you.</i>

32:25.916 --> 32:28.041
Well, a trade, if you will.

32:29.625 --> 32:32.875
<i>There's a submarine
somewhere in the Pacific.</i>

32:34.541 --> 32:37.291
<i>It has something I seek.</i>

32:37.291 --> 32:40.458
<i>Well, five somethings...</i>

32:40.458 --> 32:42.708
<i>to launch tomorrow.</i>

32:43.750 --> 32:45.791
And you're going to help me
retrieve them.

32:45.791 --> 32:48.041
Why would I do that?

32:59.666 --> 33:02.500
Because I have your daughter.

33:23.916 --> 33:27.208

<i>If you try anything clever,</i>

33:45.000 --> 33:47.125
we'll have no choice
but to kill her.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.000
She's my daughter.
I'm running this op.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.291
<i>There's no op without me.</i>

33:50.291 --> 33:53.750
<i>You have access
to Citadel's secrets.</i>

33:53.750 --> 33:54.958
Use it.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.000
I hope you're up for this.

33:58.833 --> 34:01.041
There's always
repercussions for failure.
