00:02.001 --> 00:03.128
- Ace McFumbles
here with sports.

00:03.211 --> 00:05.755
The Silverado boys' soccer team
has made the playoffs

00:05.839 --> 00:08.925
for the fourth
straight season.

00:09.008 --> 00:11.678
Wait, we have a soccer team?

00:11.761 --> 00:14.973
And now for some real news.

00:15.056 --> 00:15.890
The playoffs-bound Bulldogs
football team

00:15.974 --> 00:18.685
have lost their
kicker--Kenny Ping.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.937
Ping was selected to play
in a youth orchestra

00:21.020 --> 00:22.814
that's leaving on
a world tour--

00:22.897 --> 00:26.693
which leads me to my new
segment--"Bonehead of the Week."

00:26.776 --> 00:28.987
- [bone clanging]

00:29.070 --> 00:30.155
- This is Ace McFumbles.

00:30.238 --> 00:33.908
Didn't know, now you do.
You're welcome.

00:33.992 --> 00:35.827
- This is a disaster.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.704
We can't play without a kicker.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.457
- I know. It's one of the most
important positions on the team.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.876
- Who's going to kick field
goals for extra points?

00:42.959 --> 00:43.793
- Or kickoffs?

00:43.877 --> 00:44.961
- I just realized the kicker

00:45.044 --> 00:48.548
does a lot more for
this team than I do.

00:48.631 --> 00:51.092
- We could give a chance
to a lovable underdog--

00:51.176 --> 00:52.469
a little guy no one
expects anything from,

00:52.552 --> 00:55.263
but, if given the opportunity,
might inspire us all.

00:55.346 --> 00:58.016
- That's it! We can teach
my family mule to kick.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.851
[laughing]
He only has three legs.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.060
No one would expect
anything from him.

01:01.144 --> 01:04.522
But, my, uh, that'll be
an inspiring story.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.608
- That's not what I...

01:06.691 --> 01:08.151
Never mind.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.861
- [whistle shrills]
- All right.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.112
We need a kicker--and fast.

01:11.196 --> 01:11.821
It's time to find out
which one of you

01:11.905 --> 01:14.657
has the best leg on the team.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.620
- Oh! Ow!

01:18.703 --> 01:20.663
Troy don't kick.

01:34.427 --> 01:38.223
- Look at Newt. He seems like
he knows what he's doing.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.350
- COACH: Yeah, well, kickers
are usually the smallest,

01:40.433 --> 01:42.685
weakest, least-athletic
guys on the team.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.855
Maybe this is his moment.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.593
{\an8}What? It's a compliment.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.887
{\an8}- Well, in cheerleading, I was
a natural at high kicking.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.806
Kind of a savant.
[laughing]

03:01.890 --> 03:03.474
Okay.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.113
Curse you, Kenny Ping!
[groaning]

03:17.196 --> 03:19.782
- I believe this is yours.
- Thanks. Sorry.

03:19.866 --> 03:23.036
Kicking a football is a lot
harder than it looks.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.079
- Oh, really? Is it?

03:25.163 --> 03:26.247
- Well, yeah.
It's not like you can

03:26.331 --> 03:29.292
just come up and kick it
through your first time.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.795
It takes timing
and precision and--

03:32.879 --> 03:35.965
Whoa!
[laughing]

03:36.049 --> 03:38.801
Okay, I guess it's
not that hard.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.055
- Hey, you with
the freakishly strong leg,

03:42.138 --> 03:43.473
do you wanna play kicker?

03:43.556 --> 03:46.601
- No, thanks, I'm good.
- What? Why not?

03:46.684 --> 03:48.770
- Football's not my thing.
- [laughing]

03:48.853 --> 03:50.396
Seriously?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.773
Football's not his thing?

03:51.856 --> 03:54.484
This is Texas.
It is the only thing.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.320
- Well, not to Hunter.
All he cares about is soccer.

03:57.403 --> 04:00.198
- And bein' a jerk.
- A jerky jerk.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.699
- What's that even mean?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.910
- Look, Hunter was the kicker
on our youth football team,

04:03.993 --> 04:05.495
and he was a cool dude.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.622
Then, one day, right before
the biggest game of the season,

04:07.705 --> 04:10.500
he left us--to join
the soccer team.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.835
- Left us? He deserted us.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.337
And then we got crushed because
we didn't have a kicker.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.466
- You guys, that's too bad,
but it's in the past.

04:18.548 --> 04:21.427
Right now, we need a kicker
and Hunter is our best option.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.888
- Well, Bella, look, don't waste
your time, all right?

04:23.972 --> 04:26.933
Even if you do convince him,
he'll just end up ditching us.

04:27.016 --> 04:28.476
- We don't have much
time left.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.853
We've gotta give it a try.
What else can we do?

04:30.937 --> 04:31.646
- [speaking behind hand]
Give Newt another shot?

04:31.729 --> 04:33.856
What?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.609
- Please. No.

04:36.693 --> 04:38.152
No.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.363
- Nineteen. Twenty.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.533
Come on, if Michelle Obama
can do it, you can, too.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.244
- Have you seen the biceps
on Michelle Obama?

04:46.327 --> 04:50.039
- She can bench press Barack.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.457
- [whistle shrills]

04:51.541 --> 04:53.918
- Now that's enough.
Practice is over.

04:54.002 --> 04:54.961
But I have a homework
assignment for you.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.338
I need you to go online

04:57.422 --> 04:59.924
and research the cheapest
70-inch TVs you can find.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.051
- What does that have
to do with cheerleading?

05:02.135 --> 05:03.511
- Nothing.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.722
But when my boyfriend left me,
he took the flat screen.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.976
- PEPPER: We've gotta
do something.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.395
Ever since Miss Park got dumped,
she's been a total nightmare.

05:12.478 --> 05:16.733
- Tell me about--Ow!--it.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.234
- As a result of
my eavesdropping,

05:18.317 --> 05:21.571
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.781
Have you thought of setting
Miss Park up with a new guy?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.367
That might cheer her up.
- That's not a bad idea.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.536
- But who? We're talking
about Miss Park.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.205
Her only hobbies are
knitting and ping-pong.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.498
- I know someone who's
into ping-pong

05:32.582 --> 05:34.876
and he's as lonely
and sad as she is.

05:34.959 --> 05:39.589
- Newt, you're far
too young for her.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.090
- I'm talking about Coach.
- Oh.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.594
- Oooh, Coach and Miss Park
would make a really cute couple.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.512
- I'd totally shake them.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.847
- Great, I'll help you guys.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.682
I've watched a ton
of romantic comedies--

05:49.766 --> 05:51.642
even the one where
the baker falls in love

05:51.726 --> 05:53.770
with the wedding cake--
"Bake Me Your Wife."

05:53.853 --> 05:56.314
It's so good.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.441
- Uh, thanks, but we
don't need help.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.318
- We're girls. We're born
with the romance gene.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.362
I read that in "Teen Cosmo."

06:03.446 --> 06:05.031
- Right. Well, when your plan
doesn't work out,

06:05.114 --> 06:06.616
you know where to find me.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.410
- Standing behind me listening
to my conversation?

06:09.494 --> 06:11.537
- I just wanna be there
when you need me.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.464
- So, Hunter, we didn't formally
meet the other day. I'm--

06:21.547 --> 06:25.218
- Bella, the girl who
can't kick a football.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.470
- Yeah, I was gonna
stop at "Bella,"

06:27.553 --> 06:29.514
but, yes, that is true.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.891
Anyway, I baked you these.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.185
- Oh, free cookies.
My favorite kind.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.187
- Not to brag, but they are
really, really awesome.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.773
It's my secret ingredient--

06:38.856 --> 06:41.192
chocolate-covered
wouldn't-you-like-to-know.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.819
- Pretzels?

06:42.902 --> 06:48.741
- Any who, uh, Hunter, we really
want you on the football team.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.077
- Bella, I know how
those guys feel about me.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.745
And the feeling's mutual.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.122
So it's not gonna work out.

06:54.205 --> 06:57.041
- But you took my cookies!

06:57.125 --> 06:57.834
- No, I didn't.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.794
- Hunter, wait.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.921
We need you on the team.
What can I do?

07:02.004 --> 07:03.923
How about I help you
with your homework?

07:04.006 --> 07:06.634
I'm a really good tutor.
- I'm a really good student.

07:06.717 --> 07:09.512
- Uh, wash your dirt bike?
- I skateboard.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.891
- Wash your skateboard?
- Who washes a skateboard?

07:13.975 --> 07:14.934
- Okay, okay, there must
be something.

07:15.017 --> 07:19.605
I've got...$6 and a punch-card
from Squeezee's.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.024
One more punch and you
get a free sundae.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.277
- I don't like ice cream.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.194
- What? Everybody
likes ice cream.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.738
Now you're just
being difficult.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.450
- You're right.
I love ice cream.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.619
If you seriously want
me to be your kicker,

07:33.703 --> 07:35.204
how about you give us
your practice field for a week.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.582
- The football field?
- Yeah.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.834
The soccer team has to use
the overflow parking lot.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.003
- The one that's full
of rocks and scorpions?

07:42.086 --> 07:44.005
- I've been stung twice.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.590
- Yikes!

07:45.673 --> 07:47.633
That's horrible,
but I don't know

07:47.717 --> 07:49.677
if I can just give
you our field.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.386
- It's not my problem.

07:50.469 --> 07:52.597
Figure it out, quarterback.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.309
- [mimicking]
"Figure it out, quarterback."

07:56.392 --> 07:59.187
- Want these?
They're not very good.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.772
- Oh.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.233
- It's been rough
since Hubert left me.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.735
That's why I've been making
you girls practice so hard.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.445
You know, to get
our minds off of him.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.071
- But our minds aren't
on him--yours is.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.283
- Don't talk back, girl.

08:12.366 --> 08:14.243
- I can't take much
more of this.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.954
- Don't worry. There's Coach.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.873
Let's hope he likes ping-pong
as much as Newt said he does.

08:18.956 --> 08:22.251
- All right.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.461
- We were gonna play
some ping-pong.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.464
Do you wanna play?
- That might cheer me up.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.342
[laughing]
Ping-pong is my jam!

08:29.425 --> 08:31.219
- We had no idea.

08:32.510 --> 08:37.515
- Oh, too bad.
We only have three players.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.519
Unless...

08:39.602 --> 08:43.522
Coach, what are you
doing in the gym?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.483
- I'm a gym teacher?

08:45.566 --> 08:49.028
- Do you wanna play some
ping-pong with us?

08:49.111 --> 08:50.571
Well, I don't know
if that would be fair.

08:50.655 --> 08:58.371
Back in 1983, I was
a nationally-ranked junior.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.539
Oh, wow, nice paddle, Wanda.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.668
- Oh, thanks. It's autographed
by Jan Sorensen.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.295
- Jan the Man?
[laughing]

09:06.379 --> 09:07.255
He's my favorite player.
- Yeah!

09:07.338 --> 09:09.340
- Give it here.
- [laughing]

09:09.423 --> 09:12.009
- This is gonna be so easy.

09:12.093 --> 09:14.053
- [paddles clap]

09:17.640 --> 09:19.934
- Oh! Nationally-ranked?

09:20.017 --> 09:21.936
More like nationally-stanked.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.189
- Well, if you'd just set me up,
we could crush these kids.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.565
All you have to do is...

09:26.649 --> 09:29.235
- This is just angry
flirting, right?

09:29.318 --> 09:32.905

Then they'd seal it with
an affectionate fist bump.
