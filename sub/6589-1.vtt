01:52.612 --> 01:53.977
Yes.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.248
Quite dead.

01:58.551 --> 02:00.143
As a doornail.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.548
Certificate of death, sir.

03:15.895 --> 03:16.919
Stop!

03:18.531 --> 03:20.590
Back away, praddock.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.545
Tuppence is tuppence.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.400
- Beg your pardon!
- I say!

04:40.313 --> 04:42.543
Delinquents.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.982
Newspaper!

05:51.651 --> 05:53.141
We're hungry, sir!

05:54.921 --> 05:58.448
- Please, sir, we're very hungry.
- Any morsel. We're hungry, sir.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.218
- Any scraps.
- We're starving,

06:00.360 --> 06:02.055
Please, sir. We're very hungry.

06:03.429 --> 06:06.921
Merry Christmas,
from his lordship, the mayor!

06:07.567 --> 06:09.626
- Please, sir.
- Oh, look. There it is.

06:09.769 --> 06:12.033
Oi! Come back here with that!
That's our meat!

06:12.171 --> 06:14.298
Give it back! That's ours!
Come back here!

06:36.629 --> 06:38.460
- There you are, sir.
- Thanks.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.429
Fresh hot chestnuts.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.000
- How would you like this one?
- That's perfect.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.401
That's a nice fresh eel.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.702
Here is the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost. Get lost.

06:49.842 --> 06:53.437
And under which one is the pea?
Boom, boom, boom, boom...

06:53.579 --> 06:55.069
Boom! Get out of here.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.148
There we are. Watch this now.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.957
Merry Christmas, Uncle!

08:48.895 --> 08:52.353
- God save you.
- Bah! Humbug!

08:52.398 --> 08:55.265
Christmas a humbug?
Uncle! You don't mean that.

08:55.935 --> 08:57.630
Merry Christmas.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.264
What reason have you to be merry?
You're poor enough.

09:00.306 --> 09:02.740
What right have you to be so dismal?
You're rich enough.

09:03.776 --> 09:06.472
- Humbug!
- Don't be cross, Uncle.

09:06.512 --> 09:11.745
What else can I be when I live
in such a world of fools as this?

09:11.784 --> 09:14.048
Merry Christmas.

09:14.086 --> 09:17.749
What's Christmastime to you but
a time for paying bills without money.

09:17.790 --> 09:21.658
A time for finding yourself a year older
and not a penny richer.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.286
If I could work my will,

09:23.329 --> 09:26.628
every idiot who goes about
with "Merry Christmas" on his lips

09:26.666 --> 09:28.600
should be boiled in his own pudding

09:28.634 --> 09:30.727
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart!

09:30.770 --> 09:32.670
- Uncle!
- Nephew!

09:33.606 --> 09:37.542
Keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.444
Keep it? But you don't keep it!

09:41.647 --> 09:44.115
Let me leave it alone then.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.386
Much good it has ever done you.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.186
There are many things from which I have
derived good and have not profited.

09:51.657 --> 09:53.249
Christmas being among them.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.396
But I have always thought of Christmas
as a kind, charitable time.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.796
The only time when men
open their shut-up hearts

09:59.832 --> 10:02.562
and think of all people
as fellow travelers to the grave

10:02.602 --> 10:06.368
and not some other race of creatures
bound on other journeys.

10:06.405 --> 10:07.838
And therefore, Uncle,

10:08.507 --> 10:12.967
although it has never put a scrap
of gold or silver in my pocket,

10:13.012 --> 10:17.073
I believe it has done me good,
and I say, God bless it!

10:19.318 --> 10:22.253
Let me hear another
sound out of you, Cratchit,

10:22.288 --> 10:25.883
and you'll keep Christmas
by losing your situation!

10:30.963 --> 10:35.525
You're quite a powerful speaker, sir.
A wonder you don't go into Parliament.

10:35.568 --> 10:39.470
Don't be cross, Uncle.
Come, dine with us tomorrow.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.333
I'll see you in hell first.

10:42.375 --> 10:46.277
But why?
Why so cold-hearted, Uncle? Why?

10:48.314 --> 10:49.781
Why did you get married?

10:52.752 --> 10:54.413
Because I fell in love. 

10:55.655 --> 10:56.986
Because...

10:58.124 --> 10:59.785
...you fell...

11:01.494 --> 11:03.621
...in love?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.431
Good afternoon.

11:11.137 --> 11:15.233
I want nothing from you.
I ask nothing of you.

11:15.274 --> 11:18.107
- Why can't we be friends?
- Good afternoon.

11:19.645 --> 11:22.637
I'm sorry, with all my heart,
to find you so resolute.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.412
But I have made the trial
in homage to Christmas, and therefore,

11:25.451 --> 11:28.045
- merry Christmas, Uncle!
- Good afternoon!

11:28.087 --> 11:30.647
- And a happy New Year!
- Good afternoon!

11:30.690 --> 11:33.420
And a very merry Christmas
to you too, Mr. Cratchit.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.359
Merry Christmas to you, sir.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.495
There's another one.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.222
A clerk making 15 shillings a week...

11:41.267 --> 11:45.670
...and with a wife and family,
talking about a merry Christmas.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.536
I'll retire to Bedlam.

11:47.573 --> 11:51.669
Good afternoon.
Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?

11:55.147 --> 11:59.413
Have I the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?

11:59.452 --> 12:02.148
Mr. Marley has been dead
these seven years.

12:03.255 --> 12:07.123
He died seven years ago...
this very night.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.930
Well, we have no doubt
that his generosity

12:11.964 --> 12:14.797
is well represented
by his surviving partner.

12:15.968 --> 12:19.267
At this festive season
of the year, Mr. Scrooge,

12:19.305 --> 12:23.969
it is more than usually desirable that
we should make some slight provision

12:24.009 --> 12:26.375
for the poor and the destitute.

12:26.412 --> 12:30.678
Many thousands are in want
of common comfort, sir.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.651
Are there no prisons?

12:42.561 --> 12:45.962
Prisons? Yes, yes, plenty of prisons.

12:48.033 --> 12:51.525
And the union workhouses,
are they still in operation?

12:52.471 --> 12:55.998
They are. I wish
I could say they were not.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.271
The treadmill in full vigor?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.003
- Very busy, sir.
- Good!

13:02.381 --> 13:06.283
I was afraid something had occurred
to stop them in their useful course.

13:08.287 --> 13:14.192
Yes. At this festive season, a few
of us are endeavoring to raise a fund

13:14.226 --> 13:18.686
to buy the poor some meat
and drink and means of warmth.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.858
What shall we put you down for?

13:22.134 --> 13:25.934
- Nothing.
- Oh, you wish to remain anonymous?

13:25.971 --> 13:29.805
I wish to be left alone!
I don't make merry myself at Christmas,

13:29.842 --> 13:32.902
and I can't afford
to make idle people merry.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.571
I support the establishments
I have mentioned.

13:36.615 --> 13:39.607
And those who are badly off
must go there.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.786
Many cannot go there.

13:44.824 --> 13:49.625
And, well, frankly,
many would rather die.

13:49.662 --> 13:53.723
Then they had better do it
and decrease the surplus population.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.329
Good afternoon, gentlemen!

14:01.140 --> 14:02.505
Good afternoon.

14:19.425 --> 14:22.189
You'll want all day tomorrow, I suppose?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.224
Well, if quite convenient, sir.

14:25.731 --> 14:28.461
It's not convenient, and it's not fair.

14:28.934 --> 14:32.563
If I were to dock you a half a crown
for it, you'd think yourself ill-used.

14:32.605 --> 14:37.372
And yet you don't think me ill-used
when I pay a day's wages for no work.

14:38.110 --> 14:41.443
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

14:41.480 --> 14:45.177
Poor excuse for picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December.

14:47.753 --> 14:51.553
But I suppose you
must have the whole day.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.320
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.253
Sir.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.242
In honor of Christmas Eve!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.044
Bugger it!

17:14.433 --> 17:16.627
Where are you? Here!

17:18.203 --> 17:21.400
Why does everything
seem to happen to me?

17:51.103 --> 17:53.196
Get away! Get away!

18:14.293 --> 18:15.317
Balderdash!

20:07.206 --> 20:09.674
I have given myself the willies.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.509
That's what it is.

22:40.092 --> 22:41.252
It's all still a hum...

23:17.462 --> 23:18.486
How now!

23:19.297 --> 23:20.958
What do you want with me?

23:20.999 --> 23:24.730
Oh, much.

23:27.372 --> 23:32.071
- Who are you?
- Ask me who I was.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.737
Who were you then?

23:34.579 --> 23:37.742
In life, I was your partner,

23:37.783 --> 23:41.014
Jacob Marley.

23:46.224 --> 23:47.816
Can you sit down?

23:48.493 --> 23:51.929
- I can.
- Do it then.

24:04.242 --> 24:06.972
You do not believe in me.

24:09.548 --> 24:10.947
I don't.

24:10.982 --> 24:14.179
Why do you doubt your senses?

24:14.219 --> 24:17.017
Because the littlest thing
can affect them.

24:17.055 --> 24:20.616
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

24:20.659 --> 24:24.356
You may be an undigested bit of beef.
A blot of mustard.

24:24.396 --> 24:28.093
A crumb of cheese.
A fragment of underdone potato.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.569
There's more of gravy than of grave
about you, whatever you are.

24:34.072 --> 24:39.305
Mercy! Dreadful apparition,
why do you trouble me?

24:39.344 --> 24:43.678
Man of worldly mind,
do you believe in me or not?

24:43.715 --> 24:45.649
I do! I must!

24:45.684 --> 24:50.314
Woe! Woe is me!

24:50.355 --> 24:53.188
You are fettered in chains. Why?

24:53.625 --> 24:57.425
I wear the chain I forged in life.

24:57.462 --> 25:02.593
I made it link by link and yard by yard.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.603
Do you recognize its pattern?

25:06.905 --> 25:11.365
Can you imagine the weight and length
of the chain you bear?

25:11.409 --> 25:15.539
It was as heavy and long
as this seven Christmas Eves ago.

25:15.580 --> 25:20.108
Oh, yours is a ponderous chain.

25:21.887 --> 25:25.345
Jacob, tell me no more.

25:25.390 --> 25:27.517
Speak comfort to me, Jacob.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.063
I have none to give.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.564
I cannot stay.

25:38.603 --> 25:41.163
I cannot linger anywhere.

25:41.206 --> 25:46.337
Mark me, in life, my spirit never walked
beyond our countinghouse,

25:46.378 --> 25:51.748
never roved beyond the narrow limits
of our money-changing hole.

25:51.783 --> 25:55.879
Now endless journeys lie before me.

25:57.222 --> 26:01.352
Seven years dead
and traveling all the time?

26:02.327 --> 26:06.388
The whole time. No rest, no peace.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.801
You must've covered
a lot of ground in seven years.

26:15.006 --> 26:20.808
I was blind!
Blind! I could not see my own life!

26:20.845 --> 26:26.545
Squandered and misused.
Oh, woe... Oh, woe is me!

26:26.585 --> 26:29.281
But you were always
a good man of business!

26:29.321 --> 26:31.482
Business!

26:43.301 --> 26:46.964
Mankind... was my business.

26:47.005 --> 26:50.099
The common welfare was my business.

26:51.009 --> 26:55.503
Charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence were all my...

27:13.398 --> 27:16.834
Hear me! My time is nearly gone.

27:16.868 --> 27:20.565
I will. But don't be hard upon me,
Jacob. Pray.

27:20.605 --> 27:22.766
I am here to warn you

27:22.807 --> 27:26.573
that you have yet a chance
and a hope of escaping my fate.

27:26.611 --> 27:30.411
A chance of my procuring, Ebenezer.

27:32.584 --> 27:36.816
You were always a good friend
to me, Jacob. Thank 'ee.

27:36.855 --> 27:40.256
You will be haunted by three spirits.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.886
That's the chance and hope?

27:46.665 --> 27:49.361
- I'd rather not.
- Expect the first

27:49.401 --> 27:51.699
tomorrow when the bell tolls one.

27:52.737 --> 27:55.968
Couldn't I take them all at once,
and have it over with, Jacob?

27:57.075 --> 28:00.602
Expect the second the next night
at the same hour.

28:01.780 --> 28:05.375
And the third upon the next night,

28:05.417 --> 28:08.443
when the last stroke of 12

28:09.087 --> 28:11.851
has ceased to vibrate.

28:19.431 --> 28:23.492
Look to see me no more.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.865
I'm sorry.

28:58.903 --> 29:01.371
I wish I could help you.

30:17.248 --> 30:21.844
Are you the spirit whose coming
was foretold to me?

30:23.221 --> 30:25.519
I am.

30:37.969 --> 30:41.405
Is it possible that
you might put your cap on?

30:43.741 --> 30:49.270
Would you so soon put out,
with your worldly hands,

30:49.314 --> 30:53.478
the light I give?

30:53.518 --> 30:55.577
No, no! No, no! I'm so sorry.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.589
I meant nothing by it.
I meant no offense.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.784
I just thought I...

31:16.374 --> 31:19.605
Who and what are you?

31:22.347 --> 31:26.807
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.322
Long past?

31:32.924 --> 31:35.859
Your past.

31:37.462 --> 31:39.930
Rise.

31:39.964 --> 31:44.333
And walk with me.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.313
But I am mortal and liable to fall.

32:04.956 --> 32:08.289
Bear but a touch of my hand there...

32:10.028 --> 32:14.362
...and you shall be upheld
in more than this.

33:01.446 --> 33:02.811
Good heavens.

33:03.948 --> 33:05.813
I was bred in this place.

33:07.385 --> 33:09.285
I was a boy here.

33:09.320 --> 33:13.552
Your lip... is trembling.

33:15.626 --> 33:18.094
And what's that?

33:20.631 --> 33:23.896
- On your cheek?
- Nothing.

33:24.802 --> 33:26.565
Something in my eye.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.066
Do you remember the way?

33:34.112 --> 33:36.171
Remember it?

33:37.015 --> 33:39.415
I could walk it blindfolded.

33:41.586 --> 33:43.952
Giddyup! Giddyup!

33:49.160 --> 33:53.824
These are but shadows of things
that have been.

33:54.632 --> 34:00.070
They have no consciousness... of us.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.102
I knew them.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.908
I know every one of them.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.382
They were schoolmates of mine.

34:14.952 --> 34:17.750
Let's go on.

34:32.503 --> 34:35.097
This...

34:35.139 --> 34:37.164
This was my school.

34:37.442 --> 34:40.969
This school is not quite deserted.

34:42.380 --> 34:44.313
A solitary child...

34:44.949 --> 34:47.746
...neglected by his friends...

34:48.252 --> 34:51.983
...is left here still.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.453
I know.

35:36.367 --> 35:37.629
Poor boy.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.361
Poor, poor boy.

35:41.739 --> 35:47.405
Let's... see another Christmas.

36:11.969 --> 36:15.097
Ebenezer!

36:15.139 --> 36:16.401
Ebenezer!

36:16.440 --> 36:21.810
Dear, dear brother!
I've come to bring you home!

36:21.846 --> 36:25.111
- Home, little Fan?
- Yes, home!

36:25.449 --> 36:28.816
Father is so much kinder
than he used to be.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.549
He spoke so gently to me one night.

36:31.589 --> 36:34.558
I was not afraid to ask him
if you might come home.

36:34.592 --> 36:36.560
And he said yes!

36:36.594 --> 36:39.290
And he sent me in a coach to fetch you.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.855
And we're to be together
all the Christmas long.

36:41.899 --> 36:45.699
And to have the merriest time
in all the world!

36:47.038 --> 36:49.768
You're quite a woman, little Fan.

36:54.779 --> 36:59.307
- She had a large heart.
- She died a woman.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.952
And had, as I think...

37:04.322 --> 37:05.846
...children.

37:06.824 --> 37:09.349
Yes, one child.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.124
True.

37:11.762 --> 37:14.526
- Your nephew.
- Yes.

37:35.786 --> 37:38.482
Do you know this place?

37:39.490 --> 37:43.551
Know it? I was an apprentice here!

37:48.399 --> 37:50.594
Why, it's old Fezziwig.

37:50.635 --> 37:54.628
Bless his heart!
It's Fezziwig alive again!

37:57.408 --> 38:00.309
Yo-ho! Ebenezer, come on!

38:02.713 --> 38:05.876
Come on! Dick! Come on!
It's 6:00.

38:05.916 --> 38:08.077
They're going to be here soon.

38:09.287 --> 38:14.156
Dick Wilkins. Bless me, yes.
There he is, Dick Wilkins.

38:14.191 --> 38:16.421
He was very attached to me, was Dick.

38:20.731 --> 38:24.929
Yo-ho, me lads! No more work tonight.
It's Christmas Eve!

38:24.969 --> 38:26.266
Hooray!

38:26.304 --> 38:28.363
Dick, Ebenezer,
let's get cleared away.

38:28.406 --> 38:31.739
We want lots of space.
Lots and lots of space.

38:31.776 --> 38:33.607
Hee-hi!

38:43.988 --> 38:45.353
Maestro!

38:46.023 --> 38:47.923
May I present...?!

39:25.029 --> 39:28.465
Well done! Well done!

39:29.800 --> 39:34.032
And now, kind fiddler, if you please.

39:34.071 --> 39:37.700
It is time for Sir Roger de Coverley!

39:55.359 --> 39:57.884
Might I have this dance with you?

40:01.165 --> 40:03.258
Ebenezer, it's your pass.

41:14.772 --> 41:20.733
- Another idol has replaced me.
- Another idol? What idol?

41:22.179 --> 41:23.737
A golden one.

41:25.349 --> 41:29.012
There is nothing on this earth
more terrifying to me

41:29.153 --> 41:32.418
than a life doomed to poverty.

41:32.456 --> 41:35.323
May I ask, why do you condemn,
with such severity,

41:35.359 --> 41:38.385
the honest pursuit of substance?

41:39.630 --> 41:42.531
You fear the world too much, Ebenezer.

41:44.401 --> 41:46.892
- You've changed.
- Changed?

41:46.937 --> 41:51.067
Perhaps grown wiser,
but I have not changed toward you.

41:51.108 --> 41:53.076
Our contract is an old one.

41:53.110 --> 41:57.012
It was made when we were
both poor and content to be so.

41:58.015 --> 42:00.074
When it was made...

42:01.685 --> 42:05.746
- You were another man.
- I was a boy!

42:11.462 --> 42:13.487
I release you, Ebenezer.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.928
Have I ever sought release?

42:18.969 --> 42:22.461
- In words, no.
- In what, then?

42:23.707 --> 42:25.538
In an altered spirit.

42:26.477 --> 42:28.707
In another atmosphere of life.

42:29.980 --> 42:34.178
In everything that made my love
of any worth in your sight.

42:35.719 --> 42:39.849
Tell me, Ebenezer, if this contract
had never been between us,

42:39.890 --> 42:41.790
would you seek me out now?

42:44.595 --> 42:45.960
No.

42:48.732 --> 42:50.597
You think not?

42:51.735 --> 42:54.795
I would gladly think otherwise
if I could.

42:56.774 --> 43:01.336
But if you were free today,
would you choose a dowerless girl?

43:02.046 --> 43:05.015
A girl left penniless
by the death of her parents?

43:06.216 --> 43:08.776
You, who weighs everything by gain?

43:13.223 --> 43:15.521
I release you, Ebenezer.

43:16.894 --> 43:19.863
May you be happy in the life
you've chosen.

43:25.903 --> 43:29.236
Spirit, remove me from this place.

43:29.273 --> 43:32.572
I told you, these were shadows
of things that have been.

43:32.610 --> 43:36.546
They are what they are.
Do not blame me.

43:36.580 --> 43:39.276
Remove me. I cannot bear it.

43:52.062 --> 43:55.327
Leave me! Take me back!

43:56.233 --> 43:58.133
Haunt me no longer!

44:56.593 --> 44:59.118
Oh, blast!

45:31.328 --> 45:33.558
Enter, Scrooge!

46:09.533 --> 46:14.266
Come in! Come in
and know me better, man!

46:20.410 --> 46:24.176
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

46:26.049 --> 46:28.847
Look upon me!

46:36.994 --> 46:40.725
You have never seen
the likes of me before?

46:44.568 --> 46:45.694
Never.

46:45.736 --> 46:49.900
Have never walked forth
with my elder brothers?

46:51.575 --> 46:53.702
I don't think that I have.

46:54.678 --> 46:57.841
You have many brothers?

47:05.722 --> 47:08.350
More than 1,800.

47:08.659 --> 47:13.687
1,842, to be exact.

47:20.604 --> 47:24.631
I see you wear a scabbard,
but no sword.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.403
Indeed.

47:31.215 --> 47:35.777
Peace on Earth. Goodwill toward men.

47:39.590 --> 47:43.686
Spirit, conduct me where you will.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.267
Touch my robe.

48:52.863 --> 48:55.923
What's happening? What are you doing?

49:26.496 --> 49:30.159
- Very strange.
- Indeed.

49:30.801 --> 49:35.966
Not many mortals are granted
a heavenly perspective of man's world.

49:36.006 --> 49:37.496
Yes.

50:25.288 --> 50:27.085
It's quite beautiful.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.713
Spirit, these poor people
have no means to cook their food.

50:56.753 --> 50:58.584
And yet you seek
to close the only places

50:58.622 --> 51:01.648
in which they can warm
their meager meals every seventh day.

51:09.332 --> 51:11.857
Hear me, Scrooge.

51:14.504 --> 51:17.735
There are some upon this earth of yours

51:17.774 --> 51:20.834
who claim to know me and my brothers,

51:20.877 --> 51:25.541
and do their deeds of ill will
and selfishness in our name.

51:25.582 --> 51:29.040
These so-called "men of the cloth"

51:29.086 --> 51:34.456
are as strange to me and my kin
as if they never lived.

51:34.491 --> 51:38.222
Charge their doings to them, not us.

51:39.729 --> 51:42.562
Aye. I will.

51:46.970 --> 51:48.335
Smell that?

51:49.473 --> 51:51.065
Cooking goose!

51:51.908 --> 51:53.273
Come on!

52:15.765 --> 52:19.929
I take it this bleak paupers' dwelling
is of some significance.

52:19.970 --> 52:25.408
It is all your loyal clerk can afford
for his meager 15 bob a week.

52:25.442 --> 52:27.137
- Mother!
- Papa!

52:27.177 --> 52:28.940
We just came by the baker shop.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.504
And smelled our goose,
cooking delicious.

52:31.548 --> 52:35.348
Shut the door, please. What happened
to your precious father?

52:35.385 --> 52:39.879
And your brother. And Martha,
she wasn't as late last Christmas Day.

52:39.923 --> 52:42.050
Mother, here she is, Mother.
Here's Martha.

52:42.092 --> 52:45.687
Martha! Wait till you see
our goose. 'Tis a wonderful one.

52:45.762 --> 52:48.094
Peter, off with you to the baker's
and collect the bird.

52:48.131 --> 52:51.794
And take the children with you.
And pray, no dallying.

52:51.835 --> 52:55.396
Why, bless your heart alive!
Dear, how late you are!

52:55.438 --> 52:59.431
We had a deal of work to finish up last
night and clear away this morning.

52:59.476 --> 53:03.242
Never mind. Long as you're here. Sit ye
down before the fire and have a warm.

53:03.280 --> 53:05.714
No. No, no, no. There's Father coming.

53:05.749 --> 53:08.912
Hide, Martha.
You must hide. Hide, Martha.

53:17.594 --> 53:22.395
- It's cold out there.
- Hello, Father. Hello, Timmy.

53:27.370 --> 53:29.099
Why, where's our Martha?

53:30.340 --> 53:32.035
Not coming.

53:33.043 --> 53:37.275
Not coming?
Not coming upon Christmas Day?

53:38.782 --> 53:40.181
Here I am, Father!

53:41.251 --> 53:43.048
We got you, Father.

53:43.086 --> 53:47.113
I couldn't bear to see you in a state
of disappointment. If only for a giggle.

53:47.157 --> 53:49.887
It's so lovely to see you, my Martha.

53:49.926 --> 53:52.656
Come on, Timmy. I hear
the pudding singing in the copper.

53:52.696 --> 53:54.425
Shall we have a look, then?

53:55.332 --> 54:00.326
- How did little Timmy behave?
- As good as gold. And better.

54:01.338 --> 54:04.034
Somehow he gets thoughtful
sitting by himself so much,

54:04.074 --> 54:06.907
and he thinks the strangest things
you ever heard.

54:06.943 --> 54:10.379
He told me, coming home, that he hoped
the people sawed him in church,

54:10.513 --> 54:12.105
because he was a cripple...

54:13.450 --> 54:17.477
...and it might make pleasant for them
to remember it upon Christmas Day

54:17.520 --> 54:20.182
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

54:24.127 --> 54:29.394
I believe he grows more hearty
and stronger every day, my dear.

54:37.807 --> 54:39.798
The pudding looks delicious!

54:40.477 --> 54:43.844
The whole wash house
smells like a pastry cook's shop.

54:45.782 --> 54:50.913
Spirit, tell me, will Tiny Tim...?

54:50.954 --> 54:56.449
I see a vacant seat
in the poor chimney corner...

54:58.495 --> 55:01.157
...and a crutch without an owner.

55:05.268 --> 55:07.065
Carefully preserved.

55:09.973 --> 55:12.999
- Hurrah!
- The Christmas goose!

55:13.043 --> 55:16.706
Make space. Let's get that cover off.

55:17.380 --> 55:19.780
Lovely! Well done, Peter.

55:19.816 --> 55:22.979
I don't believe I've ever seen
a more magnificent goose cooked.

55:23.019 --> 55:25.510
It is a beautiful bird, that's for sure.

55:26.289 --> 55:29.918
But I'll pray that
one Christmas, perhaps,

55:29.959 --> 55:31.824
the children might taste a turkey.

55:31.861 --> 55:34.625
Perhaps one day, my dear.
Perhaps one day.

55:36.099 --> 55:37.464
A toast.

55:40.970 --> 55:42.369
To Mr. Scrooge.

55:43.540 --> 55:45.508
The founder of our feast.

55:46.710 --> 55:50.271
Founder of the feast, indeed.
I wish I had him here.

55:50.313 --> 55:52.304
I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon,

55:52.349 --> 55:54.681
and I'd hope he'd have
a good appetite for it.

55:54.718 --> 55:58.449
My dear, the children...
It's Christmas Day.

55:58.488 --> 56:00.547
Christmas Day, I'm sure.
How can one drink the health

56:00.590 --> 56:04.993
of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge?

56:05.028 --> 56:09.192
As you know he is, Robert.
Nobody knows it better than you.

56:09.232 --> 56:11.894
My dear, Christmas Day.

56:13.303 --> 56:16.568
I'll drink his health for your sake
and the day's, not for his.

56:19.008 --> 56:21.238
A merry Christmas and a happy New Year.

56:22.379 --> 56:24.870
He'll be very merry and very happy,
I have no doubt.

56:25.982 --> 56:30.612
A merry Christmas to us all,
my dears. God bless us.

56:30.653 --> 56:32.518
God bless us.

56:32.555 --> 56:35.581
God bless us, everyone.

56:36.626 --> 56:39.117
- Merry Christmas and happy New Year.
- God bless.

56:40.730 --> 56:44.723
Kind spirit,
say Tiny Tim will be spared.

56:44.768 --> 56:48.636
If these shadows
remain unaltered by the future...

56:50.707 --> 56:55.041
...the child will die.
- Die! No, spirit. No.

56:57.380 --> 57:01.874
What then? If he is to die,
he had better do it.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.252
And decrease the surplus population.

57:29.212 --> 57:31.339
- So you're thinking of an animal?
- Yes.

57:31.381 --> 57:33.349
- A live animal?
- Yes.

57:33.383 --> 57:35.783
- A rather disagreeable animal?
- Yes.

57:35.819 --> 57:37.184
- A savage animal?
- Yes.

57:37.220 --> 57:40.155
Wait, wait! Is it an animal
that grunts and growls?

57:40.190 --> 57:41.487
Yes!

57:41.524 --> 57:43.321
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

57:43.359 --> 57:44.451
- A horse?
- No.

57:44.494 --> 57:45.518
- A cow?
- No.

57:45.562 --> 57:47.052
- A dog?
- A pig?

57:47.096 --> 57:48.654
- No.
- An ass?

57:49.933 --> 57:51.423
Yes and no.

57:52.469 --> 57:56.132
I know who it is, Fred!
I know! It's your Uncle Scrooge!

57:56.172 --> 57:57.662
Yes!

58:06.149 --> 58:09.346
Christmas a humbug?
Now, he actually said that?

58:09.385 --> 58:12.684
As I live. And he believes it.

58:12.722 --> 58:14.952
I have no patience with him, Fred.

58:15.892 --> 58:17.826
I have. I'm sorry for him.

58:18.595 --> 58:21.496
Who suffers from his ill whims?
Only himself.

58:21.531 --> 58:25.126
He decides to dislike us,
won't come and dine with us,

58:25.168 --> 58:27.659
and what's the consequence?
He loses a dinner.

58:27.704 --> 58:31.936
- Indeed, he loses a very good dinner.
- Hear, hear. A magnificent dinner.

58:31.975 --> 58:33.533
Great.

58:34.043 --> 58:36.705
He's certainly given us plenty
of merriment, that's for sure,

58:36.746 --> 58:39.613
and I think it would be ungrateful
not to drink to his health.

58:39.649 --> 58:42.675
He wouldn't take it from me,
but he may have it nevertheless.

58:43.319 --> 58:46.652
A merry Christmas to the old man,
whatever he is. Uncle Scrooge.

58:46.689 --> 58:48.680
To Uncle Scrooge.

59:02.672 --> 59:05.402
Are spirits' lives so short?

59:05.441 --> 59:09.935
My life upon this globe is very brief.

59:11.781 --> 59:13.749
It ends tonight.

59:13.783 --> 59:18.379
- Tonight?
- Tonight at midnight.

59:20.356 --> 59:25.726
Hark. The time is drawing near.

59:34.871 --> 59:36.236
Forgive me...

59:37.073 --> 59:40.065
...but I see something strange
protruding from your skirt.

59:40.777 --> 59:42.938
Is it a foot or a claw?

59:43.613 --> 59:48.710
It might be a claw, for the scant amount
of flesh there is upon it.

59:51.454 --> 59:55.515
- Look here.
- Naff off!

59:55.558 --> 59:59.961
- Oh, man. Look here.
- You daft old geezer.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:03.693
Look! Look!

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.131
Down here!

01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:13.173
- Go away!
- Are they yours?

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:15.702
They are man's.

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:19.245
This boy is Ignorance.

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:22.279
This girl is Want.

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:26.055
Beware them both.

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:49.004
Have they no refuge? No resource?

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:52.143
Are there no prisons?

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:59.887
Are there no workhouses?

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:12.726
Am I in the presence of
the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:17.195
You're about to show me shadows

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:19.633
of the things that have not happened
but will happen.

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.227
Is that so, spirit?

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:27.206
Ghost of the Future, I fear you
more than any specter I have seen.

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:29.837
But I know your purpose
is to do me good.

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:33.513
I am prepared to bear you company.

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:34.607
Lead on.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.587
The night is waning fast.
It's precious time to me.

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:44.684
Lead on, spirit.

01:02:58.241 --> 01:03:01.369
- When did he die?
- Last night, I believe.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.379
- Or sometime Christmas Day.
- I thought he'd never die.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.742
What's he done with his money?

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:10.344
Hasn't left it to me. That's all I know.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.923
It is likely to be a cheap funeral.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:17.983
For the life of me, I can't think
of anyone who'd want to attend it.

01:03:18.027 --> 01:03:22.521
I don't mind going...
if lunch is provided.

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:23.896
There, yes.

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:26.432
What a frightful fellow.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.937
- All right.
- Good day, gentlemen.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:39.710
Get ahold of yourself, Ebenezer.
You're having a wobbly.

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.047
You won't get me in here.

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.490
Christmas pudding, no doubt.

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.444
I'm... I'm on Lime Street.

01:07:10.493 --> 01:07:11.892
Come now.

01:08:42.818 --> 01:08:44.649
Merry Christmas, Joe.

01:08:44.687 --> 01:08:47.484
And happy New Year,
to be sure. Come in.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:52.386
Sit down in me parlor
and let's have a look.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.596
Here.

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.798
What do you call these,
Mrs. Dilber, huh?

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.569
Mrs. Dilber?

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.872
Bed curtains.

01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:14.707
You mean to say you took them down
while he was lying there?

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:16.881
I do.

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.019
And why not?

01:09:21.557 --> 01:09:25.254
You was born to make your fortune,
and you certainly will do it.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:29.162
Well, I shan't hold back my hand
when I can get something by it...

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.689
Don't you go getting grease
on them blankets now.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.736
- His blankets?
- Whose else do you think?

01:09:36.471 --> 01:09:40.465
He won't be feeling the cold
without them now, I dare say.

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.875
I hope he didn't die
of anything catching.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:45.038
Don't you be afeard of that.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.640
I ain't so fond of his company
that I'd loiter about.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:57.484
You can look through that shirt
till your eyes ache,

01:09:57.526 --> 01:09:59.926
and you won't find one hole in it.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.591
- It was the best he had.
- Mrs. Dilber!

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:06.301
Would have been wasted, only for me.

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:10.863
- You're fired! Fired!
- How did you mean "wasted"?

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:16.742
Somebody was fool enough
to put it on him to be buried in.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:20.310
But I took it off him.

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.614
This is the end of it, you see.

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:30.823
He frightened everyone away
while he was alive.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:35.121
Only to profit us now that he's dead.

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:41.061
If he'd had somebody to look after him
when he was struck with death,

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:46.632
instead of lying there, all alone,
gasping out his last breath...

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:49.667
...well, we wouldn't have
these things to sell now, would we?

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.906
Spirit! I see! I see!

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:23.303
The case of this unhappy man
who dies a solitary, lonesome death

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:25.074
might be my own.

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.139
My life tends that way now.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.102
Merciful heavens! What's this?

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:55.066
Spirit, this is a fearful place.

01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:59.712
When I leave it, I shall not leave
its lesson. Trust me. Let's go!

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:17.589
I understand. And I would, if I could,
but I have not the power.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:35.745
Spirit, if there is any person who feels
emotion caused by this man's death,

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:38.250
show that person to me, I beg you.

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:54.699
- Are we ruined?
- There is hope yet.

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:58.532
Hope? Only if he relents.

01:12:59.708 --> 01:13:01.437
He is past relenting.

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.137
He is dead.

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:07.211
Dead?

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:13.513
To whom will our debts be transferred?

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:15.147
I don't know, but by then
we'll have the money.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:19.320
And even if we don't, it's unlikely any
new creditor will ever be so merciless.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.827
We shall sleep tonight
with light hearts, my dear.

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:27.463
Let me see some tenderness
connected to death,

01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.971
or this chamber will forever haunt me!

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.478
It's late.

01:13:45.788 --> 01:13:47.585
Past your father's time.

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:53.191
He's walked slow
these last few evenings.

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.688
Oh, he has walked...

01:13:56.732 --> 01:14:00.930
...with Tiny Tim on his shoulders...
fast, indeed.

01:14:03.405 --> 01:14:05.464
But he was very light...

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:08.299
...to carry, and...

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:12.270
...your father loved him so.

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:26.255
- Father.
- You went today, then?

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:29.762
Yes, my dear.

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:31.990
I wish you could have gone.

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:35.797
Would have done you good
to see how green a place it is.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.671
You'll see it often.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:45.644
And I promised him I would
walk there every... every Sunday.

01:14:47.015 --> 01:14:49.449
My little child!

01:14:51.086 --> 01:14:53.020
My little child.

01:14:53.188 --> 01:14:57.648
Father, please don't be grieved.
Please, Father.

01:14:57.693 --> 01:15:00.491
I'm all right, love.
I'm quite at peace.

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:06.901
I'm sure none of us
will ever forget our poor Tiny Tim.

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:09.665
- Oh, no, Father.
- Never ever.

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:11.666
Thank you.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.607
Thank you, my dears.

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:42.264
Bob.

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:14.767
Specter... something tells me
our parting moment is at hand.

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:17.433
Tell me...

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:23.642
...who... was that man
we saw lying dead?

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:58.438
Spirit...

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:05.950
...before I draw nearer
to that stone to which you point,

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:07.546
answer me one question!

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:11.083
Are these the shadows
of things that will be

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:13.185
or shadows of things that may be?

01:17:13.862 --> 01:17:16.990
Men's courses in life
foreshadow certain ends.

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:21.264
But if these courses are departed from,
these ends will change. Isn't that so?

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:27.164
No. No!

01:17:27.209 --> 01:17:30.576
Am I that man who lay upon the bed?

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:37.213
No. Spirit, hear me!

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.652
I'm not the man I was!

01:17:39.688 --> 01:17:42.589
Why show me this if I'm past all hope?

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:44.884
Spirit!

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:48.657
Spirit, assure me that I may change
these shadows you've shown me!

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:50.961
Change them by an altered life!

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.635
No, spirit! No! No, spirit!

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.411
Good spirit... help me!

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:12.052
Spirit!

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:15.086
Help me, spirit!

01:18:38.914 --> 01:18:40.745
Help, spirit!

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:56.859
Spirit, I will honor Christmas in my
heart and try to keep it all the year.

01:18:56.898 --> 01:19:00.390
I will not shut out the lessons
of the past, nor present, nor future.

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.630
Oh, please, spirit,

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:07.574
tell me I may sponge away
the writing on that stone!

01:20:00.362 --> 01:20:01.454
Still here?

01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:04.796
They're still here.

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:07.827
I'm still here.

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:10.865
I'm still here.

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:15.575
I'm still here!

01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:20.909
I don't know what to do.

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:24.715
I'm light as a feather,
merry as a schoolboy.

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.084
I've heard that laugh before.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.491
- I say, what's today?
- Eh?

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:45.832
- What's today, my fine fellow?
- Today? Why, Christmas Day.

01:20:46.441 --> 01:20:49.672
It's Christmas Day?
I haven't missed it.

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.736
The spirits have
done it all in one night.

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:55.011
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can. Of course they can.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:58.315
Hello, my fine fellow. Do you know
the poulterer's on the corner?

01:20:58.353 --> 01:21:01.686
- I should hope I did.
- What an intelligent boy.

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:04.886
Do you know whether they've sold
the prize turkey that was hanging there?

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.690
Not the little prize turkey,
the big one.

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:11.529
- The one as big as me?
- What a delightful child.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:17.064
- Yes, my buck.
- It's hanging there now.

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:19.938
Is it? Go and buy it, then!

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:23.274
- Walker!
- No, no, I'm in earnest.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:26.678
Go and buy it, bring it back here,
and I'll give you a shilling.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:29.616
Come back in less than five minutes,
and I'll give you a half a crown.

01:21:31.119 --> 01:21:35.021
I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's.
He shan't know who sent it.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:37.547
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.490
Mrs. Dilber.

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.799
Merry Christmas!

01:21:48.136 --> 01:21:50.104
Oh, my God!

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.435
He's gone mad!

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.105
My dear Mrs. Dilber,

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:04.710
you're the loveliest creature
I have ever laid eyes upon.

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:07.483
Dance with me, Mrs. Dilber.
Dance with me!

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:10.889
You're barmy, Mr. Scrooge! Unhand me!

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:15.518
He's completely deranged! Help!

01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:17.554
What a charming woman.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:19.191
Help!

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:23.995
I shall love it as long as I live.

01:22:24.639 --> 01:22:26.300
What an honest face it has.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:30.210
Hello. Here's the bird.

01:22:32.247 --> 01:22:34.010
Hello! Whoop!

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:37.083
How are you? Merry Christmas.

01:22:38.586 --> 01:22:42.454
Why, it's impossible to carry that
to Camden Town. You must have a cab.

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:46.423
Drive on, my good man!

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:58.372
Hilly-ho! Chirrup!

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:09.776
Hip, hip! Chirry-up!

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.809
Bob's your uncle! Fanny's your aunt!

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.581
Here's your aunt's fanny.

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:19.923
Live it up, folks!
You'll be a long time dead!

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:22.293
Don't let the worms have all the fun.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.404
Merry Christmas.

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.814
Good morning, sir.
A merry Christmas to you.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.946
- And to you, sir.
- Happy holiday!

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:49.149
And a merry Christmas to you.

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:52.558
- "God bless you, sir."
- Thank you, sir.

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:54.723
Glad tidings.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.458
Sir.

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:07.432
My dear sir, how do you do?
I hope you succeeded yesterday.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:09.067
A merry Christmas to you, sir.

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:11.802
Mr. Scrooge?

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:17.074
Yes. That is my name, and I fear
it may not be pleasant to you.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.880
But allow me to ask your pardon.

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:22.418
And will you have the goodness...

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:29.795
Lord bless me!

01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:34.564
- My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?
- And not a farthing less.

01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:37.799
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.239
My dear sir, I don't know
what to say to such...

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:44.177
Do not say anything.
I'm much obliged to you.

01:24:44.212 --> 01:24:46.772
Many thanks to you. And bless you.

01:25:36.631 --> 01:25:39.065
- Is your master at home?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.968
I'm... his uncle.

01:25:53.681 --> 01:25:56.115
Is it an animal that grunts and growls?

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.175
Yes.

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.708
- And lives in London?
- Yes.

01:25:58.753 --> 01:25:59.777
- A horse?
- No.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:00.845
- A cow?
- No.

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.013
A dog.

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.182
- A pig.
- No.

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:04.282
An ass.

01:26:05.593 --> 01:26:07.083
Yes and no.

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:10.456
- I know what it is, Fred! I know!
- What?

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:11.522
It's your...

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:14.933
Uncle Scrooge?

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:17.795
Well, bless my soul.

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:24.303
I've... come to dinner...

01:26:26.814 --> 01:26:28.509
...if you'll have me.

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:36.213
Of course, Uncle! Welcome! Welcome!

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:39.351
Merry Christmas!
Everybody, this is my uncle, Ebenezer.

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.159
Be good and pass this.

01:26:48.970 --> 01:26:51.564
Here you go. Enjoy.

01:26:52.073 --> 01:26:55.201
Next year we must have
this dinner at my house.

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:56.710
I insist.

01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:01.410
I'll spare no expense. After all,
you can't take it with you, can you?

01:27:01.449 --> 01:27:03.076
No, you can't.

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:36.811
A full 16 minutes late.

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:44.250
What do you mean by
coming here at this time of day?

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:48.387
I'm very sorry, sir.
I am a bit behind in my time.

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.454
You are, indeed.

01:27:51.966 --> 01:27:53.957
Step in here.

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.832
Well, it's only once a year, sir.

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:02.400
It shall not be repeated.
I was making rather merry yesterday.

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:05.344
Now, I'll tell you what, Mr. Cratchit.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.872
I'm not going to stand
for this sort of thing any longer.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.281
And therefore...

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.750
And therefore...

01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:17.087
...I am about to raise your salary!

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.333
A merry Christmas to you, Bob.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:32.667
A merrier Christmas, Bob,
my good fellow,

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:35.369
than I've given you in many a year.

01:28:35.410 --> 01:28:39.676
I'll raise your salary, and do whatever
I can to help your struggling family.

01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:41.204
And we'll discuss your affairs

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:44.343
this very afternoon
over a bowl of Christmas punch.

01:28:44.385 --> 01:28:47.149
But first, let's make up the fires.

01:28:47.188 --> 01:28:48.746
I want you to go out...

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:52.118
...and buy another scuttle of coal

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.751
before you dot another "I,"
Bob Cratchit.

01:28:55.930 --> 01:28:57.761
Off with you, Bob.

01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:00.495
We've wassailing to do.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:02.302
Hilly-ho, Bob!

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:05.363
Yeah. Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.262
And Scrooge was better than his word.

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.993
He did all that he said he would
and more.

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:38.238
And to our Tiny Tim, who got well,
Scrooge was like a second father.

01:29:38.272 --> 01:29:41.332
He became as good a friend,
as good a master

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.936
and as good a man
as the good old city ever knew.

01:29:44.879 --> 01:29:48.906
And it was always said of him
that he knew how to keep Christmas well.

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:54.284
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:57.018
God bless us, everyone.
