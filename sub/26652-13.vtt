looking for a new vessel.</i>

00:06.480 --> 00:07.400
Nora!

00:10.720 --> 00:11.790
Nora?

00:11.880 --> 00:14.236
I don't like Nate.
That would be wrong and...

00:14.320 --> 00:16.596
- Nate likes you.
<i>- Why don't you talk to Nate?</i>

00:16.680 --> 00:17.955
<i>Tell him how you feel.</i>

00:18.080 --> 00:20.231

00:20.400 --> 00:22.437
- Rebecca Silver?
- Nom-de-plume.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.976
Nearly cost her her life.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.400
She killed that bloody demon.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.712
You're letting the cold in, man.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.154
We found something, sir.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.036
But it's hard to explain.

00:47.120 --> 00:49.396
Don't stand there like a fool.
Spit it out.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.710
Something was encased in the ice.
It appears to be...

00:52.800 --> 00:53.870
Gold.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.829
Careful, sir.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.718
It's... incredible.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.516
I haven't the foggiest what it is.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.159
I know exactly what it is.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.993
My greatest discovery.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.271
Yeah. That's what they all say.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.997
Oh, hey, ladies. Was he any trouble?

01:22.720 --> 01:25.030
Slam dunk. Honestly, with Neron gone,

01:25.120 --> 01:26.918
catching fugitives
has never been easier.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.136
I thought it was gonna take all week.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.616
That's great. It means you won't
have to miss book club tonight.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.678
- That's right. Book club.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.480
Whoa! Smells like
somebody hasn't showered

01:36.560 --> 01:37.914
since birds were letters.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.753
That's a hieroglyphics joke.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.270
Ha! Nice.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.315
Oh, buddy, don't talk
with your mouth full, am I right?

01:45.760 --> 01:48.912
Mummies are the biggest dummies.
Hey, you big dummy mummy.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.071
Got your containment cell all set up,

01:51.160 --> 01:54.471
and we upgraded you
to a king-size sarcophagus.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.517
Oh, and would you like a wake-up call

01:56.600 --> 01:58.800
from the front desk in,
I don't know, about 1,000 years?

01:58.840 --> 02:00.559
Nice.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.439
All right, cool.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.680
- Bye.
- Bye.

02:11.200 --> 02:12.600
I mean, what the hell was that?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.069
- On it.
- Yeah.

02:16.880 --> 02:20.556
Z, how's it going?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.154
It's going super awesome.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.240
How are you and Nate?

02:24.880 --> 02:26.155
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:27.080 --> 02:28.040
Ah!

02:28.041 --> 02:33.435
Nate dawg... It's going totally great,
in a super platonic way.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.400
Then why are you guys being so weird?

02:36.400 --> 02:38.039
It was that awkward, huh?

02:38.120 --> 02:39.640
Even the mummy thought it was awkward.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.719
Look, I mean, you like him, right?

02:41.800 --> 02:45.555
Yeah, I think so. But I don't know
what the next step would be.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.917
Oh, that's easy.
You just jump his bones.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.960
What if I do that
and it screws up our friendship?

02:50.520 --> 02:51.556
Look, Z.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.477
Sometimes, for the good
of the relationship,

02:54.560 --> 02:57.200
you have to put yourself outside
of your comfort zone.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.030
For instance,

03:00.000 --> 03:06.076
I am going to read 500 pages of some
trashy novel by tonight, for Ava.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.749
And look, with Neron gone,

03:07.840 --> 03:10.560
now is the time for us
to get our personal lives into order.

03:11.680 --> 03:12.716
I will help you.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.029
Please don't.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.837
Relationship expert.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.240
<i>"I showed him my locket,</i>

03:21.320 --> 03:25.792
explaining, 'I keep the ones I love
in here, close to my heart.'

03:25.880 --> 03:30.113
Gustavo replied, 'I keep the ones
I love in my freezer,

03:30.200 --> 03:32.157
close to my microwave.'

03:32.240 --> 03:35.472
He had a devilish sense of humor
that I found irresistible."

03:35.640 --> 03:36.915
Hey, Ray!

03:37.080 --> 03:38.992
I was just reading our book club book
to Nora.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.719
Oh, that's really nice, Mona.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.835
Ray, are you okay?
You look like you haven't slept in days.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.832
Oh... Been having weird dreams.

03:46.920 --> 03:48.718
- How is she?
- No improvements.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.632
But no setbacks.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.040
Any news from Constantine?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.156
Nothing yet.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.120
Well, I'm sure he'll find a way
to bring her back.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.600
I'll leave you two alone.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.280
I brought you some more flowers

04:03.320 --> 04:06.438
because when you do wake up,

04:06.520 --> 04:10.275
I want you to know that your life
is going to be beautiful from now on.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.195
What the hell?

04:19.120 --> 04:20.315
What's happening?

04:24.360 --> 04:26.636
Wait. What are you doing
with the pillow?

04:27.560 --> 04:29.360
Are you smothering her?
You're smothering her?

04:40.160 --> 04:41.355
Not groovy.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.278
Not groovy at all.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.273
What's happening?

04:55.800 --> 04:59.032
What are you doing?
Why did you try to smother Nora?

04:59.760 --> 05:00.830
Are you losing it, Ray?

05:00.920 --> 05:03.276
Oh, I don't think you're crazy, Ray.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.995
Let's chat.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.675
Just Ray and Neron.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.435
Neron?

05:09.800 --> 05:11.678
No, you're dead.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.157
You're dead. This isn't real.
This isn't real.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.390
Not real?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.920
This is all in my head.
This is all in my head, okay?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.195
Ray!

05:30.080 --> 05:31.673
Wow, this place is a mess.

05:31.760 --> 05:33.797
Uh... Hey, um...

05:33.880 --> 05:36.520
Containment-level bathroom
is sort of my crying spot...

05:36.600 --> 05:38.796
- Not now, Gary!
- Okay, okay.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.797
You're a reasonable man, Ray Palmer.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.554
So I'm going to make you
a reasonable offer.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.793
Give yourself to me freely.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.994
No. No, this conversation is over.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.831
You leave me no choice
but to make you kill someone you love.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.355
You made me try to kill Nora.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.270
But why?

06:13.360 --> 06:17.593
Because, if you murder someone you love,
your soul will be mine.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.477
What is happening?

06:31.880 --> 06:33.200
Mick, fancy a brew?

06:33.280 --> 06:34.430
Laundry.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.113
Sorry! Sorry.
I'll be in the science, doing lab.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.032
Nobody bother me, or my hand.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.395
Haircut!

06:42.480 --> 06:44.080
What's all this ruckus?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.760
- Hey!
- Hey, I got it!

06:45.840 --> 06:48.719
- Is this fan mail for Rebecca Silver?
- No.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.111
It is not. Here. Give me that!

06:53.200 --> 06:56.193
An invitation for Rebecca Silver
to reveal her identity

06:56.360 --> 06:59.239
at RomantiCon 2019 for $20,000.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.073
Rebecca doesn't do cons.

07:01.200 --> 07:02.976
Now, Mick, I realize
that you don't like people knowing

07:03.000 --> 07:04.856
that you moonlight
as a romance novelist, but...

07:04.880 --> 07:06.656
Do I like look like a romance novelist
to you?

07:06.680 --> 07:08.478
Oi, listen, don't you get mad at me.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.880
Now, this is an easy score,
and we're gonna get that money.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.714
20K. How?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.360
Well, I'll be Rebecca, mate.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.714
Okay. Page one...

07:27.360 --> 07:28.680
...will have to wait.

07:33.160 --> 07:34.913
All right, people, we've got a hit.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.314
New York City, 1933.
The Adventurers Society.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.595
Shut the front door!

07:39.680 --> 07:41.000
What's the Adventurers Society?

07:41.080 --> 07:43.879
It's a club
for archaeologists and explorers.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.156
It's basically the coolest place
in history.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.754
Guys, this is gonna be awesome!

07:47.840 --> 07:49.400
Nate, you're running point on this one.

07:50.280 --> 07:51.280
With Zari.

07:51.840 --> 07:52.876
- For real?
- For real?

07:52.960 --> 07:53.960
Um...

07:56.360 --> 07:57.589
Sara, we did not discuss this.

07:57.680 --> 08:00.559
Look, relax. It's just a cleanup job.
We'll do fine.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.080
Okay.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.595
Find the fugitive,
bring him in, preferably in one piece.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.476
Now scram.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.040
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

08:10.320 --> 08:12.835
You're willing to risk an entire mission
to play matchmaker?

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
I sure am.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.976
Honestly, I'm getting
a "just friends" vibe.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.993
I bet you 20 bucks
they hook up on the mission.

08:19.080 --> 08:20.230
I'll take that.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.080
You and I running this mission
won't be weird at all.

08:30.160 --> 08:32.958
- Yeah, it's gonna be super chill.
- Yeah.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.155
And just because Sara and Ava are busy
doesn't mean everybody else is.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.280
Yes. Let's rally the troops.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.589
Yes.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.599
Raymond, we've got a legit
Time Bros mission.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.150
What? Time... Time Bros, that's us.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.910
Um... Look, I just...

08:54.080 --> 08:56.754
I've got some stuff I'm doing here.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.275
Come on, put the "schmience" away.
We got a magic blip.

08:59.360 --> 09:03.149
Look, right now, it's just me and Zari,
and if I'm being totally honest,

09:03.240 --> 09:04.799
it's a little awkward between us.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.553
So I could really use my wing man.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.600
I'm just doing
some interesting stuff here. I...

09:09.880 --> 09:11.678
It's something that has to do with me.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.630
Busy working on a vaccine for...
N...

09:15.720 --> 09:16.720
For what?

09:16.840 --> 09:17.990
Are you all right?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.157
- I got it.
- You do?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.515
This is about Nora.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.680
I'm sitting here, going on and on
about me and Zari,

09:23.760 --> 09:26.080
I'm not even thinking about
what you must be going through.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.709
I am sorry for being a bad friend.
Bring it in.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.311
What kind of punk-ass hug is that?

09:34.160 --> 09:35.719
Bring it all the way in, Raymond.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.800
Hug me.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.872
Look, whatever you're working on,

09:40.080 --> 09:41.275
you're gonna kill it.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.077
You're gonna absolutely murder it.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.160
- Ah, Ray?
- Yeah, I just sort of

09:50.480 --> 09:52.496
sometimes like
to do a pre-mission massage, you know?

09:52.520 --> 09:55.115
Just to limber up before we get out
in the field.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.112
- A little too much?
- Yeah.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.032
Well, say hello to Rebecca Silver.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.354
Try these.

10:20.920 --> 10:21.990
Perfect.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.196
Nice get-up.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.638
So you guys heard we're headed
to the '30s?

10:27.720 --> 10:28.720
No.

10:28.800 --> 10:30.871
Well, you are.
Sara put me and Nate in charge.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.994
Oh, are you and Nate finally gonna...

10:33.160 --> 10:34.310
Boom, boom.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.073
Stop, stop. Okay.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.669
Guess what. You're on the <i>Waverider,</i>
so you're going.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.399
<i>Jumpship's</i> got
a full tank though, yeah?

10:40.560 --> 10:42.040
Do you have somewhere to be?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.096
Best if you don't pry, love.
Just like I'm not asking

10:44.120 --> 10:46.720
about that naughty little number
Sara left behind for you to wear.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.435
Check your closet.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.200
- Rory, do you want to...
- Plans.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.440
Okay.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.231
I can't believe
everyone else bailed on the mission.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.354
More Adventurers Society for us.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.233
All right. Let's do this.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.079
- Allow me.
- Thank you.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.038
I know. I know. These costumes
are totally ridiculous.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.113
You look absolutely, um...

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
yeah, ridiculous.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.636
Uh, apparently, it's all part
of the cover story Sara gave me.

11:40.760 --> 11:44.515
I'm someone named Marion Ravenwood.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.640
Wait.

11:46.760 --> 11:47.760
Wait a second.

11:48.840 --> 11:54.074
Huh. Well, it says here
I am Dr. Henry Jones Jr.

11:54.480 --> 11:57.393
Professor of archaeology,
expert in the occult.

11:57.480 --> 11:58.960
And how does one say this?

11:59.040 --> 12:01.600
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.080
How...

12:03.081 --> 12:04.401
It's Indiana Jones.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.680
Yeah.

12:06.320 --> 12:09.233
- Sara set us up.
- What's that?

12:09.320 --> 12:12.597
Adventurers Society, everyone else
unavailable for the mission,

12:12.680 --> 12:14.911
dressing up like your favorite movie,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.710
it's all a setup
to send us on the perfect date.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.993
I totally get
if you want to go back to the ship.

12:25.080 --> 12:29.279
Or we can see where
this mission takes us.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.710
Oh, Mick, we're gonna make
a killing off of these people.

12:48.200 --> 12:52.240
Does Rebecca Silver belong
in sci-fi erotica or cyber-erotica?

12:52.320 --> 12:54.880
Rebecca Silver defies all categories.

12:55.080 --> 12:56.040
Excuse me. You are?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.793
It's me
you should be talking to, actually.

12:57.920 --> 12:59.240
I am Rebecca Silver.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.441
And I do not appreciate the tone
that you're taking with my bodyguard.

13:02.960 --> 13:07.079
Oh, goodness, Ms. Silver.
The Recluse of Romance.

13:07.160 --> 13:09.197
We are honored that you will be making

13:09.280 --> 13:11.875
your first public appearance ever
with us.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.475
You look exactly as I dreamed.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.080
I'm just here for the check, really.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.118
Of course. And you will get it

13:18.200 --> 13:20.510
after your public appearance,
Q&A, and book signing.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.432
Oh, chitchat with a bunch of weirdos

13:22.520 --> 13:24.736
dressed as some ridiculous alien queen
they want to bang.

13:25.721 --> 13:26.721
No problem.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.870
Number one, Garima is a warrior.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.350
- Number two, you're being rude.
- Rude?

13:34.440 --> 13:37.319
That's rich coming from you.
You're the rudest person I know.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.869
You don't get it. You need training.

13:40.720 --> 13:41.720
What time's the Q&A?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.509
In two hours.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.800
Good. We'll be there.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.310
Let's do this.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.392
Okay. Page one.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.160
Is this on audio book?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.376
<i>They say your life flashes</i>

14:08.400 --> 14:09.675
<i>before your eyes when you die.</i>

14:09.760 --> 14:10.989
<i>But what if, in that moment,</i>

14:11.120 --> 14:14.033
<i>you finally see everything
life's been trying to show you?</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:17.670
<i>That's how I discovered
that a killer was amongst me.</i>

14:18.840 --> 14:20.056
<i>I should have
known something was amiss that night.</i>

14:20.080 --> 14:22.216
<i>I was returning from hot yoga
to my sensational cliffside home,</i>

14:22.240 --> 14:23.536
<i>matcha green tea smoothie in hand,</i>

14:23.560 --> 14:24.976
<i>when I noticed my door
was slightly ajar.</i>

14:25.000 --> 14:26.096
<i>I entered, wondering if my dog walker</i>

14:26.120 --> 14:27.376
<i>or cat sitter or personal shopper</i>

14:27.400 --> 14:28.576
<i>or astrologer had failed to close it.</i>

14:28.600 --> 14:29.696
<i>That's when I heard him say,</i>

14:29.720 --> 14:32.235
<i>"There's something
I've been meaning to kill you."</i>

14:33.480 --> 14:36.439
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

14:38.480 --> 14:43.714
My esteemed colleagues,
the honor of having my flag retired

14:43.800 --> 14:49.751
is only rivaled by the honor
of sharing my latest discovery.

14:50.760 --> 14:56.233
To retrieve it required not only besting
the frozen wasteland of the Arctic,

14:56.320 --> 15:00.758
but also the physical limitations
of the human body itself.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.634
But for the sake of exploration,
I prevailed.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.076
And so, without further ado,

15:09.160 --> 15:15.475
I present to you
Gordon Gilchrist's golden mystery...

15:15.600 --> 15:16.600
egg.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.600
Now, Vincent.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.280
In the words of Ray and Mike Tyson,

15:28.360 --> 15:30.716
"I think we found our Myth-tery man."

15:34.480 --> 15:35.755
Come on, science.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.110
Something's happening.

15:45.160 --> 15:46.310
I can feel my hand again.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.074
No, no, no.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
The infection...

15:51.600 --> 15:52.750
is spreading.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.758
Gideon, where in the timeline
is John Constantine?

15:56.840 --> 16:00.038
His last known whereabouts
were in 2019 with Gary Green.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.713
Would you like me to connect?

16:01.840 --> 16:06.756
- What are you doing to me Doctor...
- Gideon? Gideon?

16:06.840 --> 16:07.840
What?

16:12.120 --> 16:14.476
We can't have anyone spying on us now,
can we, Raymond?

16:16.360 --> 16:18.113
You're all alone now.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.432
Well, it's you and me.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.556
Oh, yeah?

16:23.000 --> 16:26.471
Well, I'll just do this
the old-fashioned way.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.550
Aha!

16:36.720 --> 16:38.916
- Hello.
- Gary, hi. Ray Palmer here.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.478
By any chance,
have you spoken to Constantine lately?

16:42.560 --> 16:43.994
Worried about Nora, huh?

16:44.080 --> 16:47.391
What? Yes, but no.
I'm calling on a more personal matter.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.759
Say no more. I will be right over.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.509
What? No! No, no, no, Gary.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.795
No, Gary.

16:55.720 --> 16:56.720
How can I help?

17:00.560 --> 17:01.560
Oh, no.

17:18.280 --> 17:19.280
You hear something?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.757
- There's a guard.
- Okay.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.958
Don't worry. I can talk my way
into anywhere.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.797
Excuse me, my good man. Can you point me
to the nearest facilities?

17:43.880 --> 17:46.349
I have an urgent need to
relieve my bowel.

17:48.880 --> 17:49.880
Let's go.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.433
We are crushing this mission,
by the way.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.989
No classic Legends mishaps,

18:04.080 --> 18:06.470
and only one historically insignificant
nobody received

18:06.560 --> 18:08.233
- blunt force trauma to the head.
- Hmm.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.078
And now we get our prize.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.160
Wait.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.520
Trip wires.

18:18.720 --> 18:21.256
This is going to require one of us
to squeeze through these trip wires,

18:21.280 --> 18:24.910
maneuvering our bodies
in unexpected ways.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.872
Are you asking me to do that?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.719
No. I'm asking you to hold my coat.

18:31.480 --> 18:36.794
When I wrote <i>Uncaged Desire,</i>
I was trying to uncage my own desire.

18:36.880 --> 18:41.432
A desire to... To... To...

18:41.520 --> 18:42.936
Oh, bollocks! What's the next bit again?

18:42.960 --> 18:46.271
To feel life, not just live it.

18:46.360 --> 18:49.080
You still don't know Rebecca.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.231
Well, I know you, and you're Rebecca.

18:51.320 --> 18:53.880
Your primary mode of communication
is grunting like a caveman.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.230
Besides, I mean, Rebecca Silver
is whoever we want her to be.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.776
These people,
they don't know anything about her.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.880
What are you talking about?

19:02.480 --> 19:04.949
They read her books.
They read her letters.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.080
Her letters?

19:06.920 --> 19:08.195
Do you answer your fan mail?

19:10.760 --> 19:13.480
I just thought all this
was a big laugh at their expense.

19:14.440 --> 19:15.590
Well, it's not.

19:28.280 --> 19:29.280
Hmm.

19:49.760 --> 19:50.760
Be careful.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.556
What the hell?

19:59.400 --> 20:01.119
It's papier-mÃ¢chÃ©.

20:02.200 --> 20:03.793
Oh, my God.

20:03.880 --> 20:06.839
She did this all for us.
It's all a setup.

20:06.920 --> 20:07.920
- No.
- Yeah.

20:07.921 --> 20:08.921
- You think?
- Yeah.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.880
It was a fake magicometer alert.
Sara concocted this whole thing.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.838
- I bet you they're actors, too.
- Yeah.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.674
Gordon Gilchrist,
with the ridiculous facial hair.

20:17.760 --> 20:20.036
- The only thing that's missing? Nazis.
- Yeah.

20:21.480 --> 20:22.994
What did you do with the egg, huh?

20:24.560 --> 20:26.233
The real egg.

20:26.560 --> 20:28.756
Oh, she really went all out.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.936
- Hey.
- Well, there you are.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.816
I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna make it.

20:38.840 --> 20:40.911
This is a...
interesting choice of venue.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.071
We can't have book club without Nora.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.470
It takes all three of us
for a book club quorum.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
Very sweet.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.394
- Cheers, babe.
- Thank you.

20:50.360 --> 20:54.877
All right. So who do you guys think
is the real killer?

20:54.960 --> 20:56.599
Because I have my theories.

20:58.480 --> 21:00.517
Oh, my God. This can't be real.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.759
- I have to go, now.
- What?

21:02.840 --> 21:05.480
You just said that book club requires
all three of you.

21:05.640 --> 21:07.916
It's Rebecca Silver.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.352
She's revealing her identity
at RomantiCon, tonight.

21:12.320 --> 21:13.549
Rebecca Silver?

21:13.720 --> 21:16.599
The sex-positive novelist
reinventing feminism.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.000
Yeah, we know who she is.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.118
Make sure you take lots of pictures.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.312
Oh, my God, thank you.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.675
I can't believe I'm going to be

21:23.800 --> 21:25.837
breathing the same air
as Rebecca Silver.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.038
- Okay, so...
- Hmm.

21:31.760 --> 21:33.274
What did you think of the book?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.313
Oh, you wanna keep doing book club?

21:35.400 --> 21:37.517
Babe, we don't have to.
We can just forget it.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.752
I thought it would be nice for us
to be able to do something of yours.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.314
Aw!

21:42.720 --> 21:44.393
That's so sweet, thank you.

21:46.080 --> 21:47.958
- I didn't read the book.
- What?

21:48.320 --> 21:50.198
- Sorry.
- Seriously?

21:50.360 --> 21:52.352
Honestly, I usually just drink rosÃ©

21:52.440 --> 21:55.877
and let Mona go on and on
and use it as a mini-vacay for my brain.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.957
Well, it was actually
a really good book.

22:02.040 --> 22:05.875
Wait, wait. Come on. I can still drink
rosÃ©, and you can go on and on.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.600
- Mmm.
- Come on. Come on.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.756
Okay, fine.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.629
So I think the real killer
was the dog walker.

22:13.880 --> 22:14.800
No.

22:14.801 --> 22:18.635
Yes, I mean,
all that pent-up frustration.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.237
She treated him like a doormat.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.151
You can't help me. I need Constantine.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.716
Well, I may not be a master
of the Dark Arts,

22:27.800 --> 22:29.996
but I am an intern of the Dark Arts.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.914
You're interning for Constantine?

22:32.920 --> 22:33.920
Yeah.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.256
He's letting me study his spell books
if I water his plants

22:36.280 --> 22:38.033
while he searches for a cure for Nora.

22:38.120 --> 22:39.880
But, besides, what other options
do you have?

22:40.200 --> 22:43.113
Come on. Tell the Gare-Bear
what ails you.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.270
I don't know how to explain it,

22:46.760 --> 22:50.310
but it feels like there's something
inside of me.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.296
Oh, yeah. You know, there's
a beautiful singer inside of me,

22:53.320 --> 22:54.576
but no one's ever going to meet her.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.831
No. No, Gary. No, Gary. This is bad.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.351
This is very bad,
and I don't know how to get it out.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.234
Indigestion. I know just the spell.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.358
I'll have your pipes cleared out
in no time.

23:05.440 --> 23:06.476
Let me just look it up.

23:09.760 --> 23:10.840
Good thing it's not a demon

23:10.880 --> 23:12.997
because, if it was,
you wouldn't be able to tell me.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.993
Weird rule that keeps the victim silent,

23:18.080 --> 23:20.197
all the while trying to
murder a loved one

23:20.280 --> 23:22.749
in order to seal in
the demonic possession forever.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.679
Why did you just stab yourself?

23:27.800 --> 23:29.154
I didn't.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.431
- You're possessed.
- Yes!

23:33.720 --> 23:35.154
I... I... I can help.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.076
Where is the egg?

23:41.320 --> 23:42.754
Take it easy, Hitler Youth.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.832
The egg's broken. It was a crappy prop.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.513
The real egg.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.160
Do not anger me.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.636
Look, this was a good effort,
like really good.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.440
But we've done Nazis before,
but like, real Nazis.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.598
So, if it's okay with you,

23:55.680 --> 23:58.149
I would rather just...
pull the plug on this.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.879
- Yeah.
- My friend here

24:00.080 --> 24:01.753
- is a surgeon.
- Oh, nice.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.317
He will kill you until you tell me
where the real egg is.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.151
- Uh, let's tell Sara we're on to her.
- Yeah.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.993
Mmm.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.912
- Hello.
<i>- Hi, Sara. Nate and Zari here.</i>

24:14.480 --> 24:15.834
<i>Uh, first of all, well-played.</i>

24:15.920 --> 24:18.416
<i>Yeah, setting up this
whole adventure for us to go on a date</i>

24:18.440 --> 24:19.715
<i>was way over-the-top,</i>

24:19.800 --> 24:20.870
<i>but, in the same breath,</i>

24:21.000 --> 24:22.912
very sweet.
And if I were to give a note,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.037
the Nazis were just like a tad too much.

24:25.160 --> 24:26.840
What are you...
What are you talking about?

24:26.920 --> 24:29.310
Are they the same theater troop
as Ava's parents?

24:29.400 --> 24:31.676
- <i>What?</i>
- Sara, drop the act.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.400
Nazis killing us with throwing daggers.
Come on.

24:34.480 --> 24:36.437
Listen to me.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.399
Look, I did purposely put the two of you
on a mission together,

24:39.480 --> 24:40.994
but this is a real mission,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.116
not a game.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.200
<i>Those are real Nazis.</i>

24:45.480 --> 24:46.480
Whoa!

24:55.400 --> 24:58.791
And now, young lady, you die.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.679
- Sorry, Nate.
- For what?

25:14.320 --> 25:15.320
Wow.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.916
- You okay?
- Yeah, that was actually really intense.

25:22.640 --> 25:24.472
See, they took care of things
on their own.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.633
And they were clearly about to hook up.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.096
- No, they weren't. Wait.
- You owe me 20 bucks.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.040
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

25:30.041 --> 25:31.097
Were you guys about to hook up?

25:31.120 --> 25:32.496
- It was definitely on the table.
- No, no, no, no.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.751
- See. I told you.
- Come on... It doesn't matter.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.256
Okay, now that you know that
it's a real mission, where's the egg?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.760
Yeah, and where is Ray?

25:38.840 --> 25:40.216
Isn't he supposed to be
quarterbacking on this?

25:43.120 --> 25:45.032
Ray? Ray, come in.

25:45.720 --> 25:46.756
Nate, buddy.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.320
Don't come back to the ship
under any circumstances.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.959
- <i>You okay, buddy?</i>
- Yeah.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.311
Just cleaning up a storm over here.

25:53.520 --> 25:57.230
<i>I don't want you to trip and break
your neck on the mopped floors.</i>

25:57.320 --> 25:58.879
Okay, bye.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.317
Bye. Okay, that was weird, even for Ray.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.551
- We should check on him.
- You go check on Ray.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.640
We'll handle the egg.

26:04.720 --> 26:08.475
Um... I'm sorry that our first date
got ruined by Nazis.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.519
Who says it's ruined?

26:19.760 --> 26:22.912
Okay, what do we know?

26:23.800 --> 26:26.998
We found an egg, but it was fake.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.160
Someone stole the real one.

26:28.240 --> 26:30.709
What about that Gordon Gilchrist guy?

26:31.400 --> 26:32.595
He's the one who found it,

26:32.680 --> 26:34.400
so I don't know
why he would have stolen it.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.736
Although I sort of think
his poor assistant, Vincent,

26:36.760 --> 26:37.760
did most of the work.

26:38.400 --> 26:40.915
- Wait. That's just like the book!
- It is?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.914
The book from book club!

26:43.520 --> 26:45.193
Vincent is the doormat!

26:45.360 --> 26:47.192
Look, it's always the doormat.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.272
It was the dog walker in the book,
and, now,

26:49.360 --> 26:51.795
<i>this Vincent guy is mad
that he didn't get any credit.</i>

26:51.920 --> 26:55.152
<i>So we find Vincent, take the egg,
and wipe everyone's memories. Easy.</i>

26:58.120 --> 27:00.157
Ray. Ray.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.630
Remember, if you kill a loved one,
Neron will take over.

27:04.440 --> 27:07.399
Oh, well, here's the thing, Gary.
I like you.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.200
But...

27:09.280 --> 27:10.280
Oh...

27:12.840 --> 27:13.840
Yeah.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.677
Got it. Old Gare.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.352
Not loved by the Legends.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.952
Bottom of the pecking order
at the Bureau.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.110
Constantine's plant sitter.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.440
Always the butt of the joke.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.592
Gary, it's not like that.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.592
It is like that, Gary.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.160
No one appreciates you.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.594
They all think you're a fool

27:48.680 --> 27:50.876
that they can use
whenever it's convenient for them.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.474
But I respect you,
and I see your potential.

27:55.280 --> 27:58.114
- Neron?
- Gary, don't listen to him.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.554
He's trying to trick you.

27:59.760 --> 28:01.752
A demon can't renege
on the deals they make.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.753
So you can believe me when I say

28:05.560 --> 28:08.200
I can make you whole again.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.994
"Whole"?

28:14.240 --> 28:15.913
Rebecca, first, let me say

28:16.000 --> 28:19.914
that your novel <i>Uncaged Desires</i>
was a sexual epiphany for me.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.616
I can't say
that I'm surprised.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.313
My writing does have that effect.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.440
But how did Officer Daphne
free Tank Tremors?

28:27.760 --> 28:30.594
Can prison guards release inmates
just because they're in love?

28:30.840 --> 28:33.674
Oh, well, you see, that was a metaphor.

28:33.880 --> 28:37.590
After all, aren't we all
in our own prisons of desire?

28:38.080 --> 28:40.072
Rebecca, in <i>Heatwaves,</i>

28:40.160 --> 28:43.278
who is the unnamed villain
who is stalking Garima?

28:43.760 --> 28:45.638
- Charlie?
- What is a villain?

28:45.720 --> 28:48.315
Is it just someone
with a different point of view?

28:48.720 --> 28:51.838
What's really stalking Garima
are the choices that she made.

28:57.520 --> 29:01.594
So you're the real Rebecca Silver, huh?

29:02.000 --> 29:03.753
Hi. Yes.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.197
I mean, that is what I have embroidered
on my satin pillowcases.

29:07.280 --> 29:09.317
Okay, then.

29:09.400 --> 29:13.633
I have a question
about your novel <i>Raw Hides.</i>

29:13.880 --> 29:17.760
When Captain Cash Harvey
fights the Prairie Bandits,

29:17.880 --> 29:21.635
why does Nasgowa stow away
in his Conestoga wagon?

29:22.720 --> 29:26.600
Well, you see, that is also a metaphor.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.359
That is not a metaphor.
She really did it.

29:30.520 --> 29:31.600
And she died because of it.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.116
The real Rebecca Silver would know.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.636
I am the real Rebecca Silver.

29:37.080 --> 29:38.355
I have tea with lemon.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.440
- I have a really small dog.
- You're a fraud.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.989
Where is the real Rebecca?

29:44.640 --> 29:46.916
Where's the real Rebecca?

29:47.000 --> 29:50.391
- Where's the real Rebecca?
- Where's the real Rebecca?

29:50.480 --> 29:53.075
Right, go to hell,
you stinking mouth-breathers.

29:54.121 --> 29:55.601
Where's the real Rebecca?

29:55.800 --> 29:57.678
Where's the real Rebecca?

29:57.920 --> 29:59.957
Where's the real Rebecca?

30:00.200 --> 30:02.032
Quiet! Give me that.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.632
Nasgowa chased Cash for one reason.

30:06.800 --> 30:11.591
It's the same reason humans have gotten
together since the dawn of time.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.918
It's why people like you
come to conventions

30:15.240 --> 30:17.835
and dress up
as your favorite characters.

30:18.080 --> 30:21.994
Why a man sits behind a desk, typing,

30:22.080 --> 30:23.514
pouring out his heart.

30:23.840 --> 30:26.878
Why an author,

30:27.280 --> 30:30.114
a writer, replies to fans.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.119
It's connection.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.592
Human connection.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.231
I am Rebecca Silver.

30:40.760 --> 30:44.037
You are Rebecca.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.879
I'd recognize that wisdom anywhere.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.400
I would have come sooner, Nora.

31:03.440 --> 31:07.195
But have you any idea how hard it is
to acquire a phoenix's tail feather?

31:08.080 --> 31:09.878
I didn't. All right.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.153
By the power above and below,

31:16.320 --> 31:21.156
I call on you, Nora Darhk,
to return to this plane and rise reborn.

31:26.720 --> 31:27.949
Come on, love.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.273
Come back to me. Come on, love.

31:35.760 --> 31:36.760
Neron...

31:36.840 --> 31:37.896
No, no, no, it's all right, love.
It's all right.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.115
He's gone. You did it.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.999
- No.
- He's gone.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.475
He has Ray.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.037
Ray?

31:53.480 --> 31:55.517
Gideon, where's Ray?

31:57.600 --> 31:59.956
Nate, you shouldn't have come.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.235
Ray, what's going on?

32:02.200 --> 32:04.590
You should leave. You can't let me get...

32:05.240 --> 32:06.390
Ray, what are you saying?

32:13.720 --> 32:15.552
You've been acting so weird lately.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.677
- I thought we were bros.
- It's not me.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.752
Don't you see? It's near...

32:20.800 --> 32:23.360
- What's near? Somebody's nearby?
- No.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.876
All right, people. Gather around.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.591
Vincent? What's the meaning of this?

32:32.120 --> 32:34.555
- I found it.
- Hand over the egg.

32:35.040 --> 32:38.078
- I should get credit for it.
- The egg is my accomplishment.

32:38.480 --> 32:39.800
It belongs to me.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.776
Everyone's memory of the egg
is about to be erased,

32:41.800 --> 32:43.200
so don't get too bent out of shape.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.034
Not so fast.

32:47.800 --> 32:50.395
Finally, the egg is ours.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.274
Oh, man, these guys.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.396
I'm Ray. The rest of me isn't.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.552
Nate, you have to get out of here.
You have to leave.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.676
I won't leave you, buddy.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.560
Okay, you got possessed by Neron.

33:07.600 --> 33:09.080
You have to go.

33:09.160 --> 33:12.471
- He's gonna make me kill you.
- No, because I believe you,

33:12.680 --> 33:15.149
Raymond, are stronger than he is.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.839
Nate, I'm so sorry.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.351
Why are you hitting me?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.713
Can't stop.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.838
- We're bros.
- We are bros.

33:50.760 --> 33:54.913
Okay, I give up. I give up.
You hear me, Neron? I give up.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.754
Spare Nate, and I'll let you have me.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.919
Just promise me you won't hurt him,
and I won't resist.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.152
Deal.

34:20.520 --> 34:22.556
It's nice to have a willing host.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.079
But a promise is a promise.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.835
- We gotta get that egg.
- On it.

35:03.560 --> 35:04.835
Okay, I got you.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.671
- See them whip skills?
- That gave me an idea for date night.

35:21.760 --> 35:22.760
Hmm.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.952
Oh, come on now. Don't be shy.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.114
You're a little late, Johnny.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.273
I've sort of taken over jolly old Ray.

35:41.960 --> 35:43.917
I see you've lost a step.

35:44.000 --> 35:47.391
That's the thing about mortals.
They age so quickly.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.157
But don't worry, Johnny.
I won't let you die of old age.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.274
Yeah, well, I might be
a little older, mate,

35:54.360 --> 35:57.273
but I've picked up a few tricks
along the way.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.439
That one's from Marie Laveau.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.636
Cute trick.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.896
But we both know you won't be able
to hold it for long.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.434
You're a parasite.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.950
And I will separate you from Ray Palmer.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.591
Oh, Gary. Where have you been?

36:18.680 --> 36:20.273
I was hiding in the lab.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.394
Then I heard noises.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.176
Yeah, well, go and get my steam trunk,

36:24.200 --> 36:26.112
and we can exorcise this demon
right now.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.256
Damn it, Gary. Now it's not the time

36:30.280 --> 36:32.954
for you to be standing around
like some hapless idiot.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.555
I can't hold this bastard forever.
Do it, now.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.996
Demands a lot from you,
doesn't he, Gary?

36:38.080 --> 36:39.440
But what has he ever done for you?

36:40.360 --> 36:43.239
I, on the other hand,
brought you a gift.

36:44.240 --> 36:47.039
Go ahead. Open it.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.599
No, no, no.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.513
Don't accept anything from him, Gary.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.199
My nipple.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.000
Gary, listen to me. That part of you,
it belongs to hell now.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.594
All right? Don't let it seduce you.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.519
The same way John
seduced you into being unicorn bait?

37:24.120 --> 37:25.395
It's beautiful.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.360
It's cursed.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.318
Now, back away from it, you bloody fool.

37:33.360 --> 37:35.431
It belongs to you, Gary.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.456
Come on, Gary. Think about
what you're doing, all right?

37:37.480 --> 37:38.760
Don't give in to his temptation.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.074
How did I do?

37:41.320 --> 37:43.516
Time dweeb!
What the hell are you doing here?

37:43.680 --> 37:45.592
- What do I do?
- Shut up, Gary.

37:46.440 --> 37:48.477
I'm tired of being a doormat.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.595
Gary, no.

38:10.240 --> 38:12.072
Well done, Mr. Green.

38:12.160 --> 38:14.356
I'm whole again.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.912
All systems back online.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.396
So, Zari, some big moves back there.

38:29.480 --> 38:32.200
- Yeah, you were really brave.
- Thanks.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.078
So why are you scared
to make a move on Nate?

38:35.400 --> 38:36.400
Nate.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.194
What happened?

38:41.320 --> 38:42.595
- Where is he?
- Who?

38:43.560 --> 38:44.994
Ray.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.834
Neron's got him.

39:05.720 --> 39:06.995
Sara, hey!

39:07.080 --> 39:09.834
We got you
a collectible RomantiCon tote bag.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.989
- Who died?
- Yeah, what's going on?

39:14.520 --> 39:16.239
I have some bad news.

39:18.480 --> 39:20.761
- I told you, I'm fine.
- She's stable, Director.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.856
- Thank you.
- Ava, you shouldn't be here.

39:22.880 --> 39:25.216
You should be scouring
every second of the timeline for Ray.

39:25.240 --> 39:26.833
Agents are on it as we speak.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.559
Why did he do that?

39:29.240 --> 39:31.576
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
but I need your help.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.434
My help?

39:34.600 --> 39:35.600
Why?

39:36.680 --> 39:39.593
Because, no matter how many agents
I send after Neron,

39:39.680 --> 39:40.736
none of them can do what you do.

39:40.760 --> 39:44.071
None of them have the powers
you have, Nora.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.552
And I trust you.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.876
Nora Darhk, I'm asking you
to face another demon.

39:50.760 --> 39:52.911
But this time, I'm asking you to face it

39:53.560 --> 39:54.914
as a member of the Time Bureau.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.472
Let's do this.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.796
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you haven't recovered yet.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.758
We gotta track down Ray.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.915
You will,
when you're better. I promise.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.469
You don't just throw a man down
with these sorts of injuries.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.677
- It's mean-spirited.
- Don't be a baby.

40:24.760 --> 40:27.719
- Does this hurt?
- Yes, Zari. It all hurts.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.357
Where doesn't it hurt, Nate?

40:30.840 --> 40:33.309
- Here?
- Yeah.

40:43.280 --> 40:44.839
Here?

40:53.920 --> 40:56.480
I guess there's an upside
to getting pummeled.

40:59.480 --> 41:02.473
You know how I never let anyone know
what I'm...

41:03.840 --> 41:04.990
really feeling?

41:05.280 --> 41:07.192
It's kind of your thing.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.960
That's how I feel, Nate.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.112
I feel the same.

41:36.600 --> 41:39.479
Gideon?

41:39.880 --> 41:41.553
What kind of egg is that?

41:43.640 --> 41:46.280
I believe, Dr. Heywood,
it's a dragon egg.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.080
Oh...

41:54.560 --> 41:55.676
Of course.

41:56.305 --> 42:02.244
