00:01.936 --> 00:04.136
Do you promise that
the testimony you shall give

00:04.138 --> 00:05.938
in the case before this court

00:05.940 --> 00:07.506
shall be the truth,
the whole truth,

00:07.508 --> 00:10.642
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

00:10.644 --> 00:12.011
I do.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.213
DDA Hobbs?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.781
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:15.783 --> 00:19.251
Detective Sykes, you were one
of the investigators

00:19.253 --> 00:21.587
working the crime scene
of this murder, is that right?

00:21.589 --> 00:22.921
Yes, that's correct.

00:22.923 --> 00:25.290
And can you describe the victim,
Thomas Edward Chandler,

00:25.292 --> 00:26.959
as you found him that morning?

00:26.961 --> 00:29.661
He had been shot once through
the right side of his head.

00:29.663 --> 00:33.098
Execution style
from a 9-millimeter.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.566
Sanchez: See the ring
near the temple?

00:34.568 --> 00:37.536
Yeah. Bullet just went
right through his head.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.204
Sanchez: And the cart
of almond milk, sir.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.773
Provenza: Almond milk, well,

00:40.775 --> 00:43.542
at least L.A. is living
up to its clichés.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.611
Looks like he slammed
into this shelf,

00:45.613 --> 00:47.479
falling backwards.
Yeah, time of death?

00:47.481 --> 00:49.515
From the heavy coagulated blood,

00:49.517 --> 00:51.450
full rigor
and complete lividity?

00:51.452 --> 00:53.652
Around 10 to 12 p.m. last night.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.754
Sykes: And he wasn't found
until early this morning

00:55.756 --> 00:58.891
when his wife, uh, Brooke,
came back from Santa Barbara.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.927
His wife just happened
to be away

01:01.929 --> 01:03.896
when her husband was murdered.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.731
Never heard of that before.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.767
Sanchez: Sir, we checked all
the windows and doors.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.302
No sign of forced entry.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.438
The only thing broken
is that beer bottle there.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.972
Like Mr. Chandler was grabbing
a drink last night

01:13.974 --> 01:15.507
after coming home from dinner.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.343
Sykes: We confirmed Mr. Chandler
had a 7:00 reservation

01:18.345 --> 01:20.712
at The Jones Room
with his work supervisor,

01:20.714 --> 01:22.147
uh, Lisa Kirk.

01:22.149 --> 01:25.284
<i> Oh.</i> What kind of work?

01:25.286 --> 01:27.920
Chandler was an engineer
at Wescott Global,

01:27.922 --> 01:30.756
$30 billion international
defense technology company

01:30.758 --> 01:33.692
based at Silicon Beach.
But not a federal employee.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.995
Uh, government-adjacent with a
fairly high security clearance.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.464
Could be why he was killed.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.566
His wife gave me his passcode
to his laptop,

01:40.568 --> 01:42.534
but it had encrypted files
that I need permission

01:42.536 --> 01:44.970
from D.C. to open,
so I secured the computer

01:44.972 --> 01:46.371
and sent it downtown to Cyber.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.240
Well, what about cameras?

01:48.242 --> 01:50.876
I mean, a guy like this
would have security cameras.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.679
Mrs. Chandler said she
prefers her privacy,

01:53.681 --> 01:55.647
and she's lived here
much longer than the victim.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.784
Sir, her first husband,
Richard Bloom,

01:58.786 --> 02:00.252
bought the house in 2000.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.888
Wife got it in the divorce
in 2015

02:02.890 --> 02:05.157
and remarried 11 months ago.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.659
Newlywed divorcée.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.529
Ah, well, does she
have any children?

02:10.531 --> 02:12.131
Uh, one from
her previous marriage --

02:12.133 --> 02:13.365
a 15-year-old boy, Danny.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.234
Danny.
Where was Danny last night?

02:15.236 --> 02:17.269
Catalina Island
camping with his dad.

02:17.271 --> 02:19.238
We have patrol waiting for him
down by the ferry.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.240
We're not making any kind
of notifications,

02:21.242 --> 02:22.908
just having 'em
come downtown separately.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.477
Well, it's just
a little miracle, isn't it?

02:25.479 --> 02:30.682
Everyone who lives here was away
when our victim is murdered.

02:30.684 --> 02:35.053
Huh. Well, where is
the newlywed widow?

02:35.055 --> 02:37.322
The door was locked
when I came home,

02:37.324 --> 02:40.993
and no one has the password

02:40.995 --> 02:43.729
except our family
and our cleaning lady.
Wait a minute.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.964
Your door has a password?

02:45.966 --> 02:48.066
They open via Bluetooth.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.102
[ Clicks ]
-It's keyless entry.

02:50.104 --> 02:52.771
-It's actually called OffKey.
-OffKey?

02:52.773 --> 02:55.908
It's an app that manages
security at your house.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.576
My ex-husband installed it.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.444
It was one of the startups
that he was investing in.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.413
Do you know your OffKey security
user name and password?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.583
Yes. It's... [ Inhales deeply ]
ChandlerFamily1,

03:04.585 --> 03:07.553
and the password is, um, God.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.655
Tom changed it every seven days.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.823
Uh, he went
to a military boarding school,

03:11.825 --> 03:14.326
so we used that alphabet
sequentially.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.228
So the Monday before last
was Charlie,

03:16.230 --> 03:18.130
so that would mean...
"D" would be Delta.

03:18.132 --> 03:19.464
Yeah.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.467
[ Touchscreen clicking ]

03:22.469 --> 03:24.236
[ Cellphone chimes ]

03:24.238 --> 03:27.573
Uh, Mrs. Chandler,
did the message

03:27.575 --> 03:31.643
you just got on your cellphone
come from OffKey?

03:31.645 --> 03:34.012
Yes, it does that when
a new device

03:34.014 --> 03:36.748
logs into the network.
Did you get a message
like that last night?

03:36.750 --> 03:41.220
No. My last alert was when...
[ Sniffles ] Tom moved in.

03:42.356 --> 03:43.689
Hobbs:
Thank you, Detective Sykes.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.058
No further questions
at this time.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.926
Ms. Rothman, your witness.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.995
Thank you, Your Honor.
Good morning, Detective.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.065
Since my client, Mr. Bloom,
had an alibi

03:53.067 --> 03:54.666
for the night of the murder,

03:54.668 --> 03:57.369
placing him a ferry boat ride
away at the time of death

03:57.371 --> 03:59.538
on Catalina Island with his son,

03:59.540 --> 04:01.373
did you consider other suspects

04:01.375 --> 04:03.575
like, say,
the victim's wife, Brooke?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.310
We looked at Mrs. Chandler,
yes,

04:05.312 --> 04:07.246
but she also had
an out-of-town alibi.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.047
Flynn: When did you leave
for Santa Barbara?

04:09.049 --> 04:12.050
Thursday, to help throw
my sister a baby shower.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.120
So you stayed with her
this weekend -- your sister?

04:15.122 --> 04:17.022
No, uh, I rented a room

04:17.024 --> 04:19.358
<i> at the Biltmore.</i>
<i> I checked out this morning.</i>

04:19.360 --> 04:21.093
Visiting family
and stayed at a hotel?

04:21.095 --> 04:23.462
I'll contact the Biltmore and
get their surveillance video.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.697
Thank you.
<i> ...high school, and, uh,</i>

04:25.699 --> 04:28.033
<i> I see her all the time,</i>
<i> and, uh...</i>

04:28.035 --> 04:30.969
I could afford the hotel room.
[ Sniffles ]

04:30.971 --> 04:33.372
Take a second, ma'am.
We know that this is hard.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.374
No, let's just get it
over with.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.177
Okay.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.646
How did your husband
get along

04:40.648 --> 04:42.314
with his co-workers
at Wescott?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.283
Like Lisa Kirk, the woman
he had dinner with

04:44.285 --> 04:45.584
before he was murdered.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.552
I've never heard of her.

04:47.554 --> 04:49.821
You don't know the name
of your husband's supervisor?

04:49.823 --> 04:52.858
No, Tom worked on
super secret stuff.

04:52.860 --> 04:55.227
He wasn't able to discuss
personnel or projects

04:55.229 --> 04:56.962
at Wescott with anyone.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.665
So if we asked you whether
this dinner he had last night

04:59.667 --> 05:01.300
was professional or personal --

05:01.302 --> 05:07.172
Oh, look, no one at Wescott
was responsible for this...

05:07.174 --> 05:09.741
this terrible thing.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.344
I've thought about it...
[ Sniffles ]

05:12.346 --> 05:13.979
And...

05:13.981 --> 05:15.847
it was Richard.

05:15.849 --> 05:18.684
<i> Richard killed Tom.</i>
<i> It had to be him.</i>

05:18.686 --> 05:20.619
<i> Flynn: Well, if by Richard,</i>
<i> you mean your ex-husband,</i>

05:20.621 --> 05:22.788
we checked out his alibi,
and he and your son

05:22.790 --> 05:25.057
have been on Catalina
since last Friday.

05:25.059 --> 05:26.758
That doesn't mean he couldn't
have given

05:26.760 --> 05:28.593
his cellphone to someone else.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.462
Mrs. Chandler's right,
isn't she?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.731
If her husband didn't open
the door himself,

05:32.733 --> 05:35.567
the killer would have had to use
a programmed phone to do it.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.803
Is that possible, Mike?
Mr. Bloom giving his phone away?

05:37.805 --> 05:40.105
I don't know yet. I'm pinging
his cell, and right now

05:40.107 --> 05:42.341
it looks like it's on its way
back from Catalina.
Yeah.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.409
<i> ...Richard could have left him</i>
<i> on Catalina and come back</i>

05:44.411 --> 05:46.912
<i> and shot him.</i>
Your ex hated your new husband
that much?

05:46.914 --> 05:50.349
There were issues,
like Danny's grades had dipped.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.983
Tom and I had agreed

05:51.985 --> 05:53.752
to take him off of the golf team
at school.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.421
And your husband and your ex
had words about that.

05:56.423 --> 05:58.056
Not just words.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.759
Two weeks ago,
Richard showed up to our house,

06:00.761 --> 06:03.662
and when we wouldn't let him in,
he took a swing at Tom

06:03.664 --> 06:05.564
<i> in the front yard.</i>
<i> Our neighbor saw it.</i>

06:05.566 --> 06:07.366
Do you think Mrs. Chandler
understands

06:07.368 --> 06:08.900
that in accusing her ex,

06:08.902 --> 06:11.036
she's also building a motive
for her teenage son?

06:11.038 --> 06:15.040
Maybe she's just desperate
for us not to look her way.

06:15.042 --> 06:19.945
Adding a new father to a family
can be tricky.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.346
Excuse me, Captain Raydor.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.915
Commander Mason,
what can I do for you?

06:23.917 --> 06:27.152
It's regarding your victim.
If we could speak privately...

06:27.154 --> 06:29.721
Certainly.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.957
Brooke:<i> Well, I had heard things</i>
<i> about Richard's past,</i>

06:31.959 --> 06:34.726
<i> but I had never seen anything</i>
<i> myself.</i>
Hmm.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.162
Flynn:<i> Not a hothead?</i>
<i> No, Tom. Tom loved his work...</i>

06:37.164 --> 06:40.365
And yet another candidate
for Assistant Chief

06:40.367 --> 06:42.634
finds a reason
just to drop by.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.837
Hmm. No matter
who gets that job,

06:45.839 --> 06:49.408
it's going to be bad for us.

06:49.410 --> 06:50.909
I was put on alert
this morning

06:50.911 --> 06:52.477
that Mr. Chandler's
personal computer

06:52.479 --> 06:54.179
had left its residence.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.781
When they tracked it to PAB,

06:55.783 --> 06:57.649
Wescott immediately
called my office.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.284
Why you, Commander,
instead of me?

06:59.286 --> 07:02.687
Well, Criminal Intelligence was
helping Chandler develop...

07:02.689 --> 07:06.258
let's call it new surveillance
technology for the LAPD.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.927
The Feds allowed me to pull
Wescott's confidential files

07:08.929 --> 07:12.164
from your victim's computer
and leave you everything else.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.899
Well, I'm surprised.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.668
Usually,
when Criminal Intelligence

07:16.670 --> 07:18.570
takes possession
of evidence...

07:18.572 --> 07:20.305
No one ever sees it again,
that's right.

07:20.307 --> 07:24.276
But... [ Lowered voice ]
Winnie Davis is watching you

07:24.278 --> 07:26.211
as closely as she is me.
Mm-hmm.

07:26.213 --> 07:29.247
And I can't afford for the more
classified element of this case

07:29.249 --> 07:31.216
to throw you off track.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.020
You want<i> me</i> to be
Assistant Chief?

07:35.022 --> 07:38.290
Commander, you are very much
in the running yourself.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.925
-I'm happy where I am.
-Me, too.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.927
Look, I've thought
about this,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.728
and for one of us
to keep our division,

07:43.730 --> 07:46.998
the other has to try
and grab the promotion.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.701
Because if Winnie Davis
becomes Assistant Chief,

07:49.703 --> 07:51.837
she'll definitely try
and restructure.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.772
And we could both be gone,
yes, I know,

07:53.774 --> 07:56.007
and there is Chief Howard
to consider.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.909
He's done, or he'd have
the job already.

07:57.911 --> 08:01.580
No, it's me, you,
or Davis.

08:01.582 --> 08:04.249
So now would be
a terrible time

08:04.251 --> 08:07.419
for Major Crimes to get lost
chasing dead ends like Wescott.

08:07.421 --> 08:09.054
Hence the laptop.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.657
And a little prayer that if
one of us moves up,

08:12.659 --> 08:14.960
the other doesn't need
to move out.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.162
Commander, are you offering me
a deal?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.898
Well, I know you love 'em.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.735
Hope the computer helps.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.737
Rothman: And you turned over
all of your findings

08:25.739 --> 08:27.806
to the defense
during discovery?
Yes, we did.

08:27.808 --> 08:30.475
Every written report,
every word of every statement?

08:30.477 --> 08:32.043
Of course.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.412
Every photograph from
the crime scene, every video?

08:34.414 --> 08:36.281
-Yes.
-You held nothing back?

08:36.283 --> 08:37.883
No.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.918
Your Honor, permission
to approach the witness

08:39.920 --> 08:41.286
and ask for her cellphone?

08:41.288 --> 08:43.321
Objection! What does
the detective's cellphone

08:43.323 --> 08:44.890
have to do with anything?

08:44.892 --> 08:46.758
Your Honor, this goes to
the credibility of the witness.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.560
I have good reasons
for this line of inquiry.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.096
Okay, I'll allow you to look
at the cellphone, Ms. Rothman,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.832
but this had better be good,
and it better be fast.
