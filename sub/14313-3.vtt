I didn't realize
Charles Xavier

04:18.519 --> 04:20.720
Yeah, but you didn't
help them.

13:10.660 --> 13:12.794
You're sure about this?

13:16.700 --> 13:19.402
SHADOWCAT:
It's like an iron
maze down here.

13:19.404 --> 13:21.271
We're definitely
on his turf.

[YELLS]

14:38.827 --> 14:41.296
Hello, Wolverine.

14:45.368 --> 14:48.771
A man with metal bones
should have more sense

14:48.773 --> 14:51.041
than to break
into my house.

14:51.043 --> 14:53.811
Ugh. What about my house?

14:53.813 --> 14:55.813
You blew it up.

14:55.815 --> 14:58.683
I'm offended by your accusation.
[ICE CRACKLING]

You're done, Magneto!

Without his helmet,
he's mine.

SHADOWCAT:
That's not going
to work on me!

16:10.834 --> 16:12.600
It doesn't have to.

16:12.602 --> 16:14.536
And I suggest
you hold on to this.

We just came
for Charles.

Ah, but you did come
looking for trouble.

Wait.

16:36.196 --> 16:39.397
Don't do this.
It's my fault.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.465
It is, isn't it?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.134
And what would
Charles think

16:42.136 --> 16:43.937
of this little
commando raid of yours?

16:43.939 --> 16:46.105
I daresay
he wouldn't approve.

16:46.107 --> 16:48.074
We know he's here.

16:48.076 --> 16:50.677
Just take us to him.

16:50.679 --> 16:53.380
All you had to do
was ask.

[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]

17:24.617 --> 17:26.919
I found him like this
on our coastline,

17:26.921 --> 17:28.354
sprawled on the rocks.

17:28.356 --> 17:29.955
Professor.

17:38.133 --> 17:40.334
He has no brain activity.

17:42.871 --> 17:45.340
Charles is a dear friend.

17:45.342 --> 17:47.475
All I've been doing
is caring for him.

17:47.477 --> 17:49.844
More like
keeping an eye on him.

17:49.846 --> 17:52.981
We both know
you're afraid of Charles.

17:52.983 --> 17:54.250
[GROWLS]

The question is, will you let us
take him home?

17:58.923 --> 18:00.924
[GROWLS]

18:00.926 --> 18:02.692
Of course.

18:02.694 --> 18:05.896
You are his children.
His place is with you.

18:05.898 --> 18:07.898
However, I wish
you would consider

18:07.900 --> 18:10.869
making Genosha
your home.

18:10.871 --> 18:13.005
No more violence,
no more--

18:13.007 --> 18:15.441
Yeah, we've seen
the billboards.

18:15.443 --> 18:17.076
Thanks, but no thanks.

18:17.078 --> 18:20.314
The offer stands.

18:20.316 --> 18:23.383
Only next time you decide
to drop by, Wolverine,

18:23.385 --> 18:26.487
use the front door.

19:04.632 --> 19:06.800
It's like
someone whispering.

[WHISPERING CONTINUES]

19:08.704 --> 19:11.804
Correct me if I'm wrong,

XAVIER [WHISPERING]:

This is impossible.

19:28.292 --> 19:31.695
Charles,
is that really you?

19:31.697 --> 19:33.864
Yes, Logan.

19:33.866 --> 19:35.666
What's happening?

19:35.668 --> 19:37.835
Who did this to you?

19:37.837 --> 19:39.837
I wish I knew.

19:39.839 --> 19:42.174
I remember nothing.

19:42.176 --> 19:44.843
Charles, there was
an unexplained blast

19:44.845 --> 19:46.078
at the institute.

You've been missing,

Come to us?
From where?

19:58.127 --> 19:59.994
The future.

19:59.996 --> 20:01.796
The coma you see me in
right now,

20:01.798 --> 20:04.733
it will last
for 20 years.

20:04.735 --> 20:07.069
I've just awoken
from it,

Charles, how does it
come to this?

20:29.597 --> 20:33.398
Because of the X-Men.
What are you saying?

20:33.400 --> 20:36.069
Each of you will admit
defeat and walk away.

20:36.071 --> 20:38.638
Only as team
do you stand a chance.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.039
Only together

20:40.041 --> 20:42.342
can you change
the course of the future.

And you, Logan--
You must lead them.

I don't know, Charles.

This hasn't been
a good fit.

Make it fit, Logan.

Otherwise all is lost.
