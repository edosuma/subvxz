01:18.328 --> 01:20.171
<i>This is fantastic,
and tonight we are here.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:21.673

01:21.748 --> 01:23.295
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:24.585 --> 01:26.428
<i>And a middle-aged guy

ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:29.464 --> 01:30.511
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

01:30.674 --> 01:32.176
<i>But I am a ventriloquist,
for those of you</i>

01:32.259 --> 01:33.385
<i>who might not have
figured that out yet.</i>

01:33.468 --> 01:36.392
<i>And people ask me all the time,
"Jeff, why this, as a career?"</i>

01:36.513 --> 01:38.515
<i>Well, I've never done
anything else.</i>

01:38.640 --> 01:40.859
<i>I taught myself ventriloquism
in the third grade,</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:43.107
<i>got a dummy,
and just kept practicing.</i>

01:43.186 --> 01:44.938
<i>I didn't have any brothers
and sisters,</i>

01:45.022 --> 01:46.774
<i>so there was no one
there to tell me</i>

01:46.857 --> 01:48.575
<i>that what I was doing
was incredibly lame.</i>

01:48.692 --> 01:50.410
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:51.236 --> 01:52.362
<i>And since I was adopted,</i>

were like, "Net our fault."</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:56.875
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:58.368 --> 02:00.871
<i>As a kid, I didn't know it was
weird to be a ventriloquist.</i>

02:00.996 --> 02:02.293
<i>But I got picked on for it.</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:04.420
<i>The good part was
the bullies didn't know</i>

02:04.499 --> 02:06.968

first, me or the freaking doll.</i>

02:07.044 --> 02:08.842
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

02:08.919 --> 02:10.967
<i>As for my parents, they were
supportive of my hobby.</i>

02:11.089 --> 02:13.308
<i>But when I was a kid,
if I said something stupid,</i>

02:13.383 --> 02:15.761
<i>my father would go, "Stop
talking out of your butt."</i>

02:15.844 --> 02:18.347
<i>Ironically, that could be
a Whole new bit in my show.</i>

02:19.806 --> 02:21.353
<i>A little muffled voice,
"Let me out."</i>

02:23.560 --> 02:24.732
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

02:26.021 --> 02:27.739
<i>By the time junior high
relied around,</i>

<i>to make matters worse,</i>

02:29.066 --> 02:30.488
<i>not only was I
a ventriloquist,</i>

02:30.567 --> 02:33.116
<i>but I also chose
to play the trombone.</i>

02:34.529 --> 02:36.452
<i>Yep, the babes
were lined up for that.</i>

02:37.908 --> 02:39.501
<i>So, in school I had braces,</i>

02:39.576 --> 02:41.624
<i>I played the trombone,
and I carried around a dummy.</i>

02:41.703 --> 02:44.172
<i>Even the nerds were like,
"Dude, you can't sit with us."</i>

02:46.792 --> 02:49.386
<i>I'm not kidding, the short
school bus started picking me up</i>

<i>simply 'cause the driver
figured he was supposed to.</i>

02:53.423 --> 02:54.595
<i>After I graduated
from college,</i>

02:54.675 --> 02:57.770
<i>I moved out to Los Angeles,
got married, had three girls,</i>

02:57.844 --> 02:59.846
<i>and because it was part
of our everyday lives,</i>

02:59.930 --> 03:03.275
<i>I guess my girls thought that what I
did for a living was not unusual.</i>

03:03.600 --> 03:05.853
<i>One day when my youngest daughter
was playing at a friend's house,</i>

03:05.936 --> 03:07.529
<i>she turned to the other kid
and goes,</i>

03:07.604 --> 03:09.072
<i>"Where are your
daddy's dolls?"</i>

03:11.608 --> 03:12.860

<i>I'm remarried, I'm the
luckiest guy on the planet</i>

03:17.781 --> 03:18.873
<i>to have my wife, Audrey.</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:21.293

came with a lot of baggage.</i>

Abu Dhabi, Israel, Malaysia</i>

<i>Oh, yeah.
"Will you marry me ?",</i>

I do actually.</i>

10:33.716 --> 10:36.640

10:36.719 --> 10:38.266
<i>Night vision goggles.</i>

10:39.931 --> 10:43.686
<i>Then she sneaks around the
house and hunts my ass down.</i>

10:43.768 --> 10:46.112
<i>It is scary stuff,
my friends.</i>

10:47.480 --> 10:49.608
<i>When was the last time you even
put your arms around your wife?</i>

10:49.691 --> 10:53.366

was choking on a piece of steak.</i>

I was drunk.</i>

what I was thinking.</i>

10:58.408 --> 10:59.785

<i>Maybe you could do
something simple,</i>

<i>like watching
a movie together.</i>

11:04.205 --> 11:06.924
<i>Oh, no, every time we watch
a movie, she falls asleep.</i>

11:07.041 --> 11:09.669
<i>And the next morning I have
to drive back to the theater</i>

one of those paper masks?</i>

11:21.764 --> 11:24.017

the Constitution is paper,</i>

you delete someone?</i>

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.097
<i>It's not as easy
as you think.</i>

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:45.144
<i>You first have to
highlight, then backspace.</i>

01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.603
<i>But explain what a
cyber-terrorist actually does.</i>

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.685
<i>I terrorize
by computer.</i>

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:55.940

you have is to make computers not work?</i>

any viruses?</i>

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:20.302
<i>Well, before the explosion, I had
a little itch, but it went away.</i>

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.268
<i>If you're a cyber-terrorist,
who's your biggest enemy now?</i>

01:03:29.389 --> 01:03:30.811
<i>The CIA,
the FBI?</i>

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:31.937
<i>Siri.</i>

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.568

for booby-traps and she said,</i>

of Hooters near you."</i>

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.487
<i>Siri did that?
Yes.</i>

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.790
<i>And then I asked her how
to get into the White House,</i>

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:50.244
<i>and she said, "Lower taxes and do
something about illegal immigration."</i>

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:52.917
<i>Thanks, bitch.</i>

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.091
<i>Have you attempted any real
cyber-terrorism yet? Yes.</i>

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.052
<i>What'd you do? I hacked
the Obama Care website.</i>

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:04.011
<i>What happened? I
accidentally made it better.</i>

<i>Look, Achmed, no matter what, you'll
always, to me, be a suicide bomber.</i>

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:38.967
<i>No, I was a suicide bomber.
That's a one-time deal.</i>

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.716
<i>Well, what was</i> a <i>typical day
like for</i> a <i>suicide bomber?</i>

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:44.798
<i>You idiot,
it was only one day.</i>

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:48.134
<i>And it wasn't
even a full day.</i>

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.396
<i>You could try for
two in a row,</i>

01:04:51.471 --> 01:04:53.018

like the Seahawks.</i>
