Guillermo!

00:09.244 --> 00:11.420
The coffin is stuck again!

00:13.901 --> 00:15.163
Guillermo?

00:15.207 --> 00:16.817
The lid is very heavy.

00:16.860 --> 00:18.210
Are you sitting on it?

00:18.253 --> 00:21.517
A vampire's familiar
can be important.

00:21.561 --> 00:23.302
Can be a very big help.

00:23.345 --> 00:26.305
It feels like you are
sitting on it, Guillermo!

00:26.348 --> 00:28.916
Guillermo is not always helpful.

00:28.959 --> 00:32.223
He can be inconsistent
and human.

00:32.267 --> 00:33.921
Guillermo?

00:33.964 --> 00:35.618
Are you hiding from me?

00:35.662 --> 00:37.316
Ha!

00:37.359 --> 00:40.319
And surprisingly sneaky.

00:40.362 --> 00:41.450
Guillermo?

00:41.494 --> 00:44.410
I am about to disembark
from my coffin.

00:44.453 --> 00:46.803
There's no one to hold my hand.

00:46.847 --> 00:50.155
He likes to test
my patience sometimes.

00:50.198 --> 00:51.156
He's like a kid.

00:51.199 --> 00:53.941
I got out of my coffin
all by myself.

00:53.984 --> 00:55.725
He's Guillermo.

00:55.769 --> 00:56.900
Guillermo?

00:56.944 --> 01:00.165
Guillermo, have you taken
another day off?

01:00.208 --> 01:02.471
Knew I shouldn't have
given him anydays off.

01:02.515 --> 01:06.171
Shh. There's a vampire
approaching your room.

01:06.214 --> 01:08.521
Ha!

01:18.966 --> 01:21.577
He's gone.

So, Guillermo has been gone

01:57.570 --> 01:59.920
for a few days now,
and as I predicted,

01:59.963 --> 02:02.227
we are doing absolutely fine.

02:02.270 --> 02:07.145
It's just so nice to have
the place to ourselves.

02:07.188 --> 02:08.320
Nandor, did you forget
to blow out

02:08.363 --> 02:10.104
the candles
before you went to bed?

02:10.148 --> 02:11.801
NANDOR:Those candles are in the hallway

02:11.845 --> 02:14.543
and not in my room, so, no,
I did not blow them out!

02:14.587 --> 02:17.459
Now the wall is all wet!

02:17.503 --> 02:18.634
Nadja!

02:18.678 --> 02:21.202
I'm not drying that wall!

02:21.246 --> 02:23.422
So, as I was saying,

02:23.465 --> 02:26.294
it is just so nice to have
the house to ourselves.

02:26.338 --> 02:28.514
You know, having
a human familiar is great,

02:28.557 --> 02:30.777
but to rely on one, I mean...

02:32.735 --> 02:35.390
Even if they don't quit, howlong will a human familiar live?

02:35.434 --> 02:38.045

to clean up
all these human juices.

They'll dry on their own.

Ah, crud, how am I supposed

03:18.085 --> 03:19.652
to go to work
looking like this?

03:19.695 --> 03:22.263
Can't you just change into
another of your beige suits?

Guillermo used to take
our clothes out once a week

03:45.373 --> 03:47.462
and bring them back clean,
and he's not here, so...

03:47.506 --> 03:49.116
Yeah, but where
did he take them?

03:49.159 --> 03:51.510
-The river?
-Oh, yes, that is
a very good point.

03:51.553 --> 03:53.251
We should contact
the village washerwoman.

03:53.294 --> 03:55.253
Someone contact
the village washerwoman!

03:55.296 --> 03:57.037
I'm not doing that!

03:57.080 --> 03:59.169
I drove him away, didn't I?

03:59.213 --> 04:01.302
Perhaps I should've been
a bit more aloof with him.

04:01.346 --> 04:02.912
What are you fucking
talking about?

04:02.956 --> 04:04.566
He's just a familiar.

04:04.610 --> 04:06.089
You're right.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.917
Fuck that guy
for making me think

04:07.961 --> 04:09.832
I need to act more aloof!

You know, I did sense

04:14.489 --> 04:17.057
he was getting more
and more sad recently.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.101
I could smell it on him.
It comes from the groin.

04:19.146 --> 04:21.103
-Ah.
-Colin Robinson,

04:21.148 --> 04:23.455
take out your cellular telephoneand take a picture

04:23.498 --> 04:26.545
of me having fun
and then send it to Guillermo,

04:26.588 --> 04:29.330
so that he knows how much
I do not miss him.

04:29.374 --> 04:32.420
Aah! Aah...

04:32.464 --> 04:34.553
I don't even have
his phone number, so...

04:34.596 --> 04:36.555
Well, look it up.

04:36.598 --> 04:38.557
Uh, what's his last name?

04:42.909 --> 04:46.608
Mm, Guillermo B... Buillermo?

04:46.652 --> 04:47.609
Yeah, but you assume
that's his first name.

04:47.653 --> 04:49.045
Could be his last name.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.873
He could be called
Mickey Guillermo.

Just look up "Guillermo."

04:54.616 --> 04:56.575
how dumb you are.

5,000 Guillermos

in the New York
metropolitan area,

05:02.668 --> 05:05.627
including Mickey Guillermos,
of which there are four.

05:05.671 --> 05:07.455
Can we maybe narrow it down
a little bit?

05:07.499 --> 05:09.588
Yes, yes, of course we can.

05:09.631 --> 05:11.111
What else do we know about him

05:11.154 --> 05:13.548
besides his first name
being Guillermo?

05:32.959 --> 05:34.395
I'll do it then.

05:35.483 --> 05:37.180
I wanted to do it.

05:37.224 --> 05:39.748

Pull!

05:45.667 --> 05:46.712
-"Pull"?
-Yeah.

05:46.755 --> 05:48.409
-Aha!
-Oh.

05:48.453 --> 05:50.759
-Here you go.
-Begone.

05:50.803 --> 05:54.372
Come back. You will forget
everything you have seen.

05:54.415 --> 05:57.200
Most importantly,
the way we are both dressed.

05:57.244 --> 05:59.464
To the fancy room again.

05:59.507 --> 06:01.422
-NADJA: Well, who is it from?
-LASZLO: Get it open.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.033
NADJA:
Well?

06:04.077 --> 06:06.471
It is from the
Nouveau Théâtre des Vampires.

06:06.514 --> 06:07.646

The Nouveau Théâtre
des Vampires is

06:17.046 --> 06:19.658
-a very, very big deal.
-They travel from Europe

06:19.701 --> 06:22.400
to the United States
once every five years.

06:22.443 --> 06:26.578
NADJA:  And only the crème de la crme de la creams of vampire society

06:26.621 --> 06:28.014
is invited.

06:28.057 --> 06:30.712
This is the first year
we have made the cut.

06:30.756 --> 06:31.844
Everyone who has seen it says

06:31.887 --> 06:33.585
it is magnificent.

06:33.628 --> 06:34.760
It is an all-vampire cast

06:34.803 --> 06:36.675
and it is just
the most beautiful,

06:36.718 --> 06:39.199
eerie, poignant, important,

06:39.242 --> 06:41.680
-important work.
-And I've heard
there's a lot of nudity.

06:41.723 --> 06:44.073
And I mean a lot,
and when I say a lot,

06:44.117 --> 06:46.641
I don't just mean a whiff
of tit, I mean the full rack.

06:46.685 --> 06:48.904
Full boobies, full boners.

06:48.948 --> 06:50.645
The full display.

06:50.689 --> 06:52.255
We're going to have so much fun.

06:52.299 --> 06:53.605
COLIN:
I am

06:53.648 --> 06:57.304
so G-damn excited to be going
to the vampire theater.

06:57.347 --> 06:59.959
There's some genitalia on show
there that would make a human

07:00.002 --> 07:02.091
go, "What is that exactly?"

07:02.135 --> 07:04.093
So we shall be honored
to attend.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.574
-Mm-hmm.
-Wait.

07:06.618 --> 07:09.882
What are we thinking?
We don't have any clothes!

07:09.925 --> 07:12.537
They are all soiled.We cannot go dressed like this.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.539
She's right.
We can't go dressed like this.

07:14.582 --> 07:16.366
We'll be laughed
out of the place.

07:16.410 --> 07:18.281
They're not going
to let us in now.

07:18.325 --> 07:20.762
-Goddamn it!
-Damn!

07:21.676 --> 07:23.765

07:23.809 --> 07:26.681
Wait, stop, guys, stop.

07:26.725 --> 07:28.640
-[quietly]:
Am I really gonna do this?
-Do what?

07:30.076 --> 07:31.077
Listen.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.385
There is a way to get
your clothes back.

07:35.429 --> 07:38.258
Don't ask me how.
You don't want to know.

07:38.301 --> 07:39.868
There's a good chance
that I'm...

07:39.912 --> 07:41.653
not even gonna
make it back alive.

07:41.696 --> 07:44.743
-[gasps]
-You mean you might be killed,
Colin Robinson?

07:44.786 --> 07:46.135
We don't want you
to hurt yourself.

07:46.179 --> 07:47.702
Me neither, damn it.

07:47.746 --> 07:49.878
But if I do
this kindness for you,

07:49.922 --> 07:51.750
can I ask for one in return?

07:51.793 --> 07:52.881
Anything. What is it?

07:52.925 --> 07:56.319
I'd really like to moveout of my room in the basement.

07:56.363 --> 07:59.497
If you retrieve our clothes,
you can move into my room.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.542
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want your room.

08:01.586 --> 08:04.502
I-I just want to move intothat other room in the basement.

08:04.545 --> 08:07.505
-Hmm?
-Sounds fair.
-Really?

08:07.548 --> 08:09.724
LASZLO:
Go ahead. Do that now.

08:09.768 --> 08:11.900
I guess we're going
to the Théâtre!

08:11.944 --> 08:15.774
[cheering, laughter]

08:15.817 --> 08:19.734
So, basically I needed to go
to the dry cleaners anyway.

08:19.778 --> 08:21.475
I just didn't want to make it
sound too easy for them,

08:21.519 --> 08:23.433
'cause you go
once or twice and then,

08:23.477 --> 08:25.174
all of a sudden
you're the go-to

08:25.218 --> 08:26.698
dry cleaning fetcher.

08:26.741 --> 08:28.700
Colin Robinson wins again.

08:37.621 --> 08:40.885
-Yeah, so I had to...
-[clattering]

08:40.929 --> 08:43.889
-[mutters]
-I had to get out
of there, so...

08:43.932 --> 08:47.370
-¿Mamá? Mamá.
-[speaking Spanish]

08:47.414 --> 08:49.155
Mamá!

08:49.198 --> 08:50.765
-Ah, tu película.
-Sí.

08:50.809 --> 08:53.202
Okay.
[speaking Spanish]

08:53.246 --> 08:55.509
Our fridge broke today, so...

08:55.553 --> 08:56.945
But, yeah, I had
to get out of there.

08:56.989 --> 08:58.773
Never mind
that I'm prone to being

08:58.817 --> 09:00.645
a vampire slayer.
[chuckles]

09:00.688 --> 09:02.516
[woman screaming]

09:02.560 --> 09:04.257
I'm, like, killing vampires,

09:04.300 --> 09:05.432
killing, killing,
killing, killing,

09:05.475 --> 09:06.738
but also wanting
to be a vampire?

09:06.781 --> 09:09.654
I just had to think
about that and also

09:09.697 --> 09:12.570
manage my everyday duties,
which were falling

09:12.613 --> 09:14.615
at the wayside
because I wasn't focused.

09:20.926 --> 09:22.623
This is it.
This is my life now.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.538
You know?
And I'm happy with that.
