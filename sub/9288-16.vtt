00:12.099 --> 00:13.498
Right now

00:13.567 --> 00:17.333
terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:17.705 --> 00:20.538
My wife and daughter have been targeted

00:20.608 --> 00:24.339
and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.045 --> 00:27.343
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer

00:27.414 --> 00:30.872
and today is the longest day of my life.

00:44.331 --> 00:47.233
Bob, what just happened?
I can't hear you.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.967
Bob, can you hear me?

00:51.406 --> 00:52.465
Bob?

00:53.408 --> 00:54.932
Bob, can you hear me?

00:57.613 --> 00:59.513
Bob, pick up the phone.

01:01.184 --> 01:03.312
Somebody, pick up the phone.

01:09.727 --> 01:11.524
Bob, can you hear me?

01:13.498 --> 01:16.229
Whoever's there, just pick up the phone.

01:17.603 --> 01:18.865
Bob?

01:20.406 --> 01:22.136
Can anyone hear me?

01:22.976 --> 01:24.876
Just pick up the phone.

01:25.779 --> 01:26.906
Pick up the...

01:32.119 --> 01:35.111
At the beep,
leave a message for Bob Ellis...

01:35.656 --> 01:37.124
Oh, God. No.

01:42.565 --> 01:44.589
Think, Jack. Just think.

01:52.643 --> 01:54.873
- Routing Operator.
- Yes, this is Jack Bauer.

01:54.945 --> 01:58.177
I want you to transfer me to Agent Watson
in our New Orleans office.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.947
- Hold on, one moment please.
- Thank you.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.621
CTU, New Orleans. Watson speaking.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.817
This is Jack Bauer in Los Angeles.

02:06.892 --> 02:10.556
You've a floating NSA operative
in your region. His name is Robert Ellis.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.121
Something terrible has happened.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.723
What do you want us to do?

02:13.800 --> 02:16.998
COMM will get you an address.
I want you to check it out.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.867
Phone me as soon as you've got anything.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.408
Jack?
I'll transfer you now.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.298
- Jack?
- Not right now. I'm busy.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.571
- You've got to see this.
- What?

02:24.813 --> 02:28.544
These are surveillance shots
of all three backup shooters.

02:28.617 --> 02:32.418
I cross-referenced the files
Ellis sent us with our Interpol records.

02:32.855 --> 02:35.381
- How long ago?
- Just now.

02:35.692 --> 02:38.684
Any or all of them
could still be targeting Palmer.

02:38.761 --> 02:39.956
Or you.

02:40.497 --> 02:43.864
- Right.
- I sent the photos to Secret Service.

02:43.968 --> 02:47.598
Make sure they brief Palmer's staff.
I want them to keep their eyes open.

02:47.672 --> 02:49.868
Right. There's one more thing, though.

02:49.942 --> 02:53.468
Johnny cool guy, here.
His name is Alexis Drazen.

02:54.012 --> 02:56.004
He's Victor Drazen's son.

02:56.082 --> 02:59.018
He was trained In Belgrade, Special Forces.

03:02.656 --> 03:03.988
Good work.

03:10.999 --> 03:13.559
- Hello.
- It's me.

03:13.636 --> 03:16.867
I wanted to tell you
we're not leaving town today after all.

03:17.272 --> 03:20.140
What made the Senator
decide to change his plans?

03:20.210 --> 03:22.041
He didn't say and I didn't ask.

03:22.112 --> 03:24.673
I was just happy
I would get to see you again so soon.

03:24.749 --> 03:27.216
Well, I'm leaving a meeting right now.

03:27.484 --> 03:29.715
I can be back at the hotel...

03:30.721 --> 03:32.120
...by 4:30.

03:32.189 --> 03:34.852
- Okay. I know where to find you.
- Okay.

03:44.270 --> 03:47.296
Daniels In position 10-98.
Can you give me a Delta check?

03:47.373 --> 03:49.842
This is Daniels. I'm in position.

03:49.910 --> 03:51.969
Touch your ear if you hear me.

03:55.483 --> 03:57.451
Paulson, do you read me?

03:58.220 --> 03:59.312
Yeah.

04:03.092 --> 04:05.652
Breeher, talk to me.
How you looking?

04:05.995 --> 04:07.930
It's quiet on my end.

04:20.278 --> 04:21.505
Paulson.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.377
Yeah, Jack. Hold on.

04:28.621 --> 04:30.486
Excuse me, Mrs. Bauer?

04:34.328 --> 04:35.658
It's Jack.

04:35.762 --> 04:37.094
Thank you.

04:44.239 --> 04:45.331
Jack?

04:45.407 --> 04:46.705
How you doing?

04:46.776 --> 04:49.836
I'm doing okay.
Just trying to get some rest.

04:51.013 --> 04:53.811
I couldn't help but feeling,
after I hung up...

04:53.883 --> 04:57.047
...I don't know, that something was wrong.

04:57.121 --> 04:58.588
No, I'm fine.

05:02.227 --> 05:04.218
A lot has happened and...

05:05.897 --> 05:07.559
...I really need to talk to you.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.064
Fine, then let's talk.

05:09.135 --> 05:11.262
No, not now. Now is not the time.

05:11.337 --> 05:12.565
Why not?

05:15.474 --> 05:19.809
You do what you have to do and
we'll talk when this is all over, okay?

05:22.583 --> 05:23.675
Okay.

05:25.386 --> 05:27.684
I'm here at CTU If you need me.

05:28.489 --> 05:29.683
I know.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.291
Okay, bye.

05:39.335 --> 05:40.894
The Senator's just arrived.

05:40.971 --> 05:44.736
All right, folks. I know you're all
busy, so I'll be as brief as I can.

05:44.874 --> 05:46.934
Good, you're just in time.

05:47.077 --> 05:48.374
What's going on?

05:48.445 --> 05:51.108
Bauer sent photos
of the people targeting you.

05:51.183 --> 05:55.085
The threat against Senator Palmer
remains a high probability.

05:55.154 --> 05:59.955
But we have gotten a significant piece
of heads-up intelligence.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.322
These three men...

06:06.066 --> 06:08.296
...are the suspected shooters.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.139
Since you're all on the front line
of this campaign...

06:12.207 --> 06:15.666
...we're hoping you can expand
our surveillance reach.

06:16.612 --> 06:19.877
We can always use more eyes and ears
In the field.

06:19.949 --> 06:24.147
If you see anyone who you suspect
as being one of these people...

06:24.220 --> 06:26.917
...let an agent know Immediately.

06:28.024 --> 06:29.355
Everybody clear on that?

06:29.427 --> 06:30.724
What's wrong?

06:30.795 --> 06:31.989
All right?

06:32.396 --> 06:35.194
The fact is, Rick ran away
before we could talk to him.

06:35.266 --> 06:37.700
- He was scared.
- Apparently.

06:41.607 --> 06:45.237
Whatever explanation he has doesn't
change the fact that he's a fugitive.

06:45.311 --> 06:49.146
If you know where he is and aren't saying,
that constitutes for a serious...

06:49.216 --> 06:51.241
I don't know where he is.

06:51.785 --> 06:55.016
- Are you sure?
- What I'm sure of is he helped us escape.

06:55.089 --> 06:58.149
If it wasn't for him,
we would have never got out of there.

07:00.729 --> 07:01.821
Kim.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.698
When people are taken hostage...

07:06.969 --> 07:09.733
...it's not uncommon for them to feel...

07:09.805 --> 07:12.467
...a certain bond with their kidnappers.

07:12.541 --> 07:14.442
Rick isn't a kidnapper.

07:15.612 --> 07:17.978
Anyway, I don't know where he is.

07:19.417 --> 07:22.443
I'm sorry, Nina.
I thought you were finished.

07:24.056 --> 07:27.183
Whenever you're ready,
we can pick up where we left off.

07:27.659 --> 07:28.957
Okay.

07:30.629 --> 07:32.256
Why don't you take a break...

07:32.331 --> 07:35.426
...and your mother and I
can finish up in here?

07:39.840 --> 07:41.102
You okay?

07:44.545 --> 07:48.073
- You sure you're okay to do this?
- Yes. Sure. Are you?

07:48.383 --> 07:49.441
Yes.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.644
Listen, Nina...

07:53.723 --> 07:56.658
I don't want you
to have to tiptoe around me.

07:57.962 --> 08:01.192
Jack and I were separated
when you slept with him.

08:01.798 --> 08:04.791
I'm not going
to hold that against you, okay?

08:16.349 --> 08:17.476
Okay.

08:19.185 --> 08:22.451
You and Kim have both said
that Rick helped you.

08:23.790 --> 08:28.023
But talking to Kim, I get the sense
that she's withholding something.

08:29.897 --> 08:31.387
Based on what?

08:32.801 --> 08:34.097
She's protecting Rick.

08:34.169 --> 08:37.730
She seems to have feelings for him,
from what I can tell.

08:39.107 --> 08:41.839
There may have been an attraction
when she met him...

08:41.910 --> 08:45.005
...but if Kimberly knew anything,
I'm sure she'd tell you.

08:45.081 --> 08:47.482
- Are you sure about that?
- She's my daughter.

08:47.551 --> 08:50.042
I think I know her better than you.

08:58.196 --> 08:59.356
Bauer.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.160
It's David Palmer.

09:01.234 --> 09:03.998
- Sir, is everything all right?
- I'm not sure.

09:04.070 --> 09:05.628
What's going on?

09:06.106 --> 09:09.165
A member of my Advance Team,
Elizabeth Nash...

09:09.409 --> 09:13.813
...she recognized one of the assassins
In the photos you sent Secret Service.

09:13.881 --> 09:16.282
It's Victor Drazen's son, Alexis.

09:16.384 --> 09:19.410
- Does she know where he is?
- They're in contact.

09:19.487 --> 09:20.853
Contact? What do you mean?

09:20.987 --> 09:22.318
In which context?

09:23.756 --> 09:25.018
Intimate.

09:27.126 --> 09:30.095
Senator, is this person in a position...

09:30.162 --> 09:32.290
...to endanger your security?

09:33.300 --> 09:34.790
I'm afraid so.

09:34.935 --> 09:36.665
She's pretty shaken up.

09:36.738 --> 09:38.035
But she wants to help.

09:38.106 --> 09:41.372
Good. We've got to bring her
into CTU now and question her.

09:41.443 --> 09:43.535
I'll get a helicopter to you
in a few minutes.

09:43.611 --> 09:45.101
I'll have her ready.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.647
Jack, what about Ellis?

09:46.715 --> 09:49.616
Did he retrieve the missing file
on Operation Nightfall?

09:49.685 --> 09:51.711
I lost contact with Ellis.

09:52.055 --> 09:53.454
Lost contact? What do you mean?

09:53.523 --> 09:55.992
We got interrupted
in the middle of our phone call.

09:56.060 --> 09:59.325
I have to be honest with you.
I've got a very bad feeling about this.

09:59.397 --> 10:00.557
So what are you telling me?

10:00.865 --> 10:04.232
I'm telling you that for now,
we have to assume that Ellis is dead.

10:05.937 --> 10:07.063
Keep me posted.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.401
Yes, sir.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.438
Milo, get me Chopper Command.

10:36.772 --> 10:38.672
- Hello?
- Rick, it's Kim.

10:40.110 --> 10:41.168
Hey.

10:41.244 --> 10:44.112
This woman here,
she's really pushing me hard.

10:44.182 --> 10:46.047
- What'd you tell her?
- The truth.

10:46.117 --> 10:49.918
- I told her that you helped us escape.
- That's really going to save my ass.

10:51.989 --> 10:54.754
I'm sorry. I'm a little edgy right now.

10:55.094 --> 10:58.495
I just think if you tell her what happened,
it'll work out.

10:58.565 --> 11:00.123
She won't believe me.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.930
I don't know how much longer
I can keep covering for you.

11:03.002 --> 11:04.095
Okay.

11:04.405 --> 11:07.238
- Can she prove anything?
- I don't think so.

11:08.142 --> 11:10.007
That's all that matters.

11:10.077 --> 11:14.515
I appreciate what you're doing and all,
but you probably shouldn't call here.

11:14.583 --> 11:17.074
- At least not for a while.
- How long?

11:17.152 --> 11:19.144
I don't know. Got to go.

11:21.991 --> 11:25.155
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Just a wrong number.

11:27.330 --> 11:29.060
I'm worked.

11:29.133 --> 11:31.727
I'm going to crash for a while, okay?

11:53.461 --> 11:56.396
Is there anything else
you can tell me about Gaines?

11:56.464 --> 11:58.956
Maybe a conversation you overheard?

12:01.769 --> 12:05.069
- Who's Gaines?
- Ira Gaines, the leader of the group.

12:05.808 --> 12:06.968
Right.

12:10.747 --> 12:12.648
- Teri...
- No, I'm fine.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.147
Maybe we should take another break.

12:15.219 --> 12:19.121
Maybe you should do your job, Nina.
Don't you have a job to do?

12:19.890 --> 12:21.916
I wish it were that simple.

12:21.993 --> 12:25.485
Things tend to get complicated
when you screw your boss.

12:27.266 --> 12:29.461
This obviously isn't working.

12:29.735 --> 12:31.202
No, it's not.

12:33.173 --> 12:37.075
Sorry. I thought I could stay calm
and rational about this, but I can't do it.

12:37.144 --> 12:39.806
- I'm sorry.
- There's no apology needed.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.815
But I think Paulson should finish up here.

12:55.631 --> 12:56.826
George.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.465
- What are you doing here?
- I'm the new quarterback.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.100
- Since when?
- Since right now.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.635
- What about Alberta Green?
- Back at District.

13:08.647 --> 13:13.209
Chappelle thought you'd do a better job
keeping an eye on me than she would.

13:13.385 --> 13:15.114
I don't know, Jack.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.716
Something like that, I guess.

13:21.328 --> 13:25.321
So, it's really Drazen's boys
that are after Palmer?

13:25.734 --> 13:28.896
This whole thing's been a revenge play
for killing their father.

13:29.303 --> 13:32.933
I know why they're gunning for you,
but why are they after Palmer?

13:34.442 --> 13:38.846
Senator Palmer was head of the
subcommittee that authorized the mission.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.712
Got Ellis tracking down
the file on that operation, right?

13:42.786 --> 13:44.047
I had Ellis.

13:44.887 --> 13:49.154
- I lost contact with him 20 minutes ago.
- You think they took him out?

13:49.626 --> 13:50.958
Yes, I do.

13:51.062 --> 13:53.758
We got a break
on another front, though.

13:54.032 --> 13:57.730
A Miss Elizabeth Nash,
part of the Senator's Advance Team...

13:57.803 --> 14:01.136
...identified one of the shooters
from photos that I'd sent over.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.868
She'd been dating him.
She had no idea who he was.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.640
She's shaken up,
but she's on her way here for a debriefing.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.246
Which one of them was she seeing?

14:10.151 --> 14:11.641
Alexis Drazen.

14:11.752 --> 14:14.586
She's supposed to meet him
in his hotel room in an hour.

14:14.656 --> 14:17.317
Good.
That'll give us time to stage an arrest.

14:17.391 --> 14:20.759
George, think about this.
What if she keeps her date?

14:20.963 --> 14:23.193
We'd have the upper hand
in this thing.

14:23.265 --> 14:24.460
See what we could learn.

14:24.534 --> 14:25.728
Risky, isn't it, Jack?

14:25.802 --> 14:30.797
I'd have a squad across the hall ready to go
before anything could possibly happen.

14:32.242 --> 14:36.178
George, I think this is too big
an opportunity just to pass up.

14:38.549 --> 14:41.451
- What time is she getting here?
- Ten minutes.

14:42.554 --> 14:46.389
- We'll talk to her, then we'll decide.
- Absolutely.

14:51.897 --> 14:53.991
She's going to the CTU office right now.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.466
Why are they taklng her there?

14:55.535 --> 14:58.801
They want to find out
everything they can about Alexis Drazen.

14:58.873 --> 15:01.398
- Is that the brother?
- No, it's his son.

15:02.143 --> 15:05.545
- Let me call you back.
- All right, I'll wait for your call.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.241
Keith, come here.

15:11.387 --> 15:12.718
What's up?

15:13.123 --> 15:16.058
We haven't had much of a chance
to talk since last night...

15:16.159 --> 15:18.355
...and it seems like every time we do...

15:18.796 --> 15:21.196
...we're at each other's throats.

15:21.265 --> 15:23.860
Everything's okay between you and me.

15:25.936 --> 15:29.634
I guess you've noticed
we haven't been on the same page today.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.139
Yes, it's been kind of hard to miss.

15:32.210 --> 15:33.906
The pressure's on.

15:34.414 --> 15:36.314
It's testing all of us.

15:37.116 --> 15:38.379
For sure.

15:39.253 --> 15:41.721
That's what I wanted to talk about.

15:43.257 --> 15:46.988
It stayed in my head,
what you said a couple of hours ago...

15:48.496 --> 15:51.727
...about how Dr. Ferragamo
has always been there for you...

15:51.800 --> 15:53.894
...when you needed someone, and I wasn't.

15:54.003 --> 15:57.838
I'm sorry, but that's just how it was then.

15:59.810 --> 16:01.800
It's all going to change.

16:03.113 --> 16:04.580
Starting now.

16:06.784 --> 16:09.185
I know I can't earn your trust overnight.

16:10.155 --> 16:13.421
But if you just come to me
when you need to talk...

16:14.126 --> 16:16.094
...I promise you, son...

16:16.730 --> 16:18.697
...I'll always be there.

16:23.403 --> 16:24.802
Thanks, Dad.

16:29.177 --> 16:31.373
So, what about Dr. Ferragamo?

16:31.580 --> 16:33.571
The police say anything?

16:34.315 --> 16:36.180
We haven't called yet.

16:38.454 --> 16:40.422
What are we waiting for?

16:40.489 --> 16:44.085
We're not putting anything off, Keith.
It's just something else has come up.

16:44.194 --> 16:45.388
Listen to me.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.897
We have a security breach in our staff.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.297
We have to deal with that first.

16:50.401 --> 16:52.596
What kind of security breach?

16:54.705 --> 16:57.334
- I can't tell you.
- Dad, you can't tell me anything...

16:57.409 --> 17:02.347
Keith, I have to be able to make decisions
around here without you challenging me.

17:02.415 --> 17:04.473
Look, everything you're feeling...

17:04.550 --> 17:06.815
Now's the time I need you, Dad.

17:06.887 --> 17:10.321
Not just to talk to me,
but to do the right thing.

17:14.161 --> 17:15.320
Keith!

17:16.830 --> 17:18.958
I will do the right thing...

17:19.733 --> 17:21.566
...at the right time.

17:22.271 --> 17:23.363
Yes.

17:24.006 --> 17:25.530
I'm sure you will.

17:32.449 --> 17:34.178
I found Bauer's wife and daughter.

17:34.251 --> 17:36.083
They were moved to a safe house.

17:36.187 --> 17:37.279
Where are you?

17:37.755 --> 17:39.245
I'm almost in.

17:40.158 --> 17:42.456
How many men are guarding them?

17:42.994 --> 17:45.429
I'm handling the situation, Andre.

17:45.531 --> 17:48.466
Rest assured.
The women will be dead soon.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.363
Call me the minute it's done.

18:42.429 --> 18:45.558
- Milo, can you help me with something?
- Yes.

18:45.633 --> 18:47.897
What's wrong with the system?
My terminal's locked.

18:47.969 --> 18:49.767
I just downloaded all my files to here.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.566
Now I can't... Damn it!

18:53.842 --> 18:56.106
Hold on a second. Let me see.

18:58.414 --> 19:00.143
Why can't I log in?

19:01.150 --> 19:03.210
What do you mean?
Mason didn't tell you?

19:03.287 --> 19:04.584
Tell me what?

19:05.456 --> 19:10.450
They downgraded your privileges to 3-W.
You're the same as everyone else here.

19:10.861 --> 19:12.021
I see.

19:14.366 --> 19:17.699
Here. This should get you
into anything you need.

19:18.204 --> 19:20.536
- Thanks.
- Jack, don't worry.

19:20.606 --> 19:23.508
You're going to be back up
in your office by tomorrow.

19:23.577 --> 19:26.067
By tomorrow I'll be lucky
if I'm not in federal custody.

19:26.145 --> 19:28.944
I'm only on provisional status
until the end of the day.

19:29.016 --> 19:33.454
As soon as Senator Palmer leaves the state,
I have to face these charges.

19:36.724 --> 19:39.387
I'm sorry. You're all set here.

19:40.429 --> 19:41.623
Thanks.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.058
- Milo.
- Yeah?

19:49.639 --> 19:53.007
Have you noticed anyone accessing
anything unusual on the servers?

19:53.077 --> 19:54.408
What do you mean by unusual?

19:54.478 --> 19:58.438
I don't know. Anything received
or relating to sensitive intel?

19:59.117 --> 20:02.211
No. But I mean,
I haven't been looking for it.

20:03.288 --> 20:04.778
Start looking.

20:05.223 --> 20:07.886
Wait, you think
there's another mole inside CTU?

20:07.960 --> 20:10.758
I don't know. Just let me know
if you find anything, okay?

20:10.830 --> 20:11.923
Okay.

20:15.669 --> 20:18.763
All I'm saying is, don't test me.
I'm not testing you.

20:18.839 --> 20:20.272
I will do what I said!

20:20.340 --> 20:21.399
Keith.

20:21.476 --> 20:24.570
I am serious because I have
nothing left to lose. Not anymore.

20:24.646 --> 20:25.635
I know you're upset.

20:25.714 --> 20:27.910
- That's right.
- Okay, we should talk.

20:27.983 --> 20:29.177
I'm glad you understand.

20:29.251 --> 20:31.277
You know
the Griffith Park Observatory?

20:31.354 --> 20:32.412
Yeah.

20:32.489 --> 20:33.887
Can you meet me there now?

20:34.323 --> 20:37.225
Yeah, I can be there.
Fifteen minutes.

20:39.229 --> 20:41.323
- Be where?
- Nowhere.

20:41.399 --> 20:43.697
- Keith.
- I'm trying to protect you.

20:43.768 --> 20:46.294
The last time you tried to protect me,
someone died.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.895
Nicole, please.

20:48.707 --> 20:51.403
I'm sorry. That was a terrible thing to say.

20:51.477 --> 20:52.535
The less you know...

20:52.611 --> 20:56.048
What's going on?
Who were you talking to on the phone?

20:56.216 --> 20:59.708
- You trust me, don't you?
- Trust goes both ways, Keith.

21:01.822 --> 21:02.914
Carl.

21:04.125 --> 21:05.149
Why?

21:05.226 --> 21:07.922
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life with the regret...

21:07.995 --> 21:11.693
...I've been living with for years.
- You didn't kill Gibson intentionally.

21:11.767 --> 21:13.701
But I kept the truth from coming out...

21:13.769 --> 21:16.364
...and now with Dr. Ferragamo dead...

21:16.773 --> 21:19.503
I can't do that again, Nicole. I won't.

21:19.642 --> 21:21.804
- I need your help.
- For what?

21:23.380 --> 21:26.247
This Secret Service guy
has been dogging me all day.

21:26.316 --> 21:29.285
- I need you to help me get past him.
- He's here to protect us.

21:29.353 --> 21:31.185
Everything that's been happening today...

21:31.256 --> 21:33.281
Everything that's still happening...

21:33.358 --> 21:36.988
It's not too late to change the way
this all plays out.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.426
Now, do you trust me or not?

21:45.939 --> 21:47.873
All right, good. Okay.

21:47.941 --> 21:49.306
All right.

22:05.261 --> 22:06.523
Excuse me.

22:06.596 --> 22:09.828
I was on the phone,
and I heard a clicking sound...

22:09.900 --> 22:12.869
...and I'm wondering
If that's my dad being bugged...

22:12.937 --> 22:14.735
...or If I'm just being paranoid.

22:14.806 --> 22:17.103
Why don't we just check it out?

22:51.547 --> 22:53.641
Victor Drazen had two sons.

22:53.917 --> 22:56.147
We know Alexls Drazen Is here.

22:56.386 --> 22:58.878
I think we should assume
Andre Drazen Is here as well.

22:58.956 --> 23:00.787
With at least
two other shooters, right?

23:00.858 --> 23:03.259
Potentially a third, assuming Ellis is dead.

23:04.463 --> 23:06.912
Here she comes.

23:11.116 --> 23:13.950
Miss Nash?
George Mason, District Director.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.145
This Is Agent Jack Bauer.

23:16.256 --> 23:17.588
Mr. Bauer.

23:17.725 --> 23:21.456
Senator Palmer told me about you.
He said I should do whatever you tell me...

23:21.529 --> 23:23.794
...and I could be sure
that I'd be In good hands.

23:23.865 --> 23:24.990
I appreciate that.

23:25.066 --> 23:28.264
I must say, if you wish a lawyer present,
you're entitled to that...

23:28.336 --> 23:30.304
...but we in no way consider you a suspect.

23:30.372 --> 23:32.534
We just want to ask you a few questions.

23:32.608 --> 23:33.597
I don't need a lawyer.

23:33.676 --> 23:35.166
I'll cooperate in any way I can.

23:35.745 --> 23:36.871
Okay.

23:36.946 --> 23:38.312
Come on in.

23:43.020 --> 23:45.181
Can I have something to drink?

23:45.255 --> 23:47.520
I'll get you a glass of water.

23:52.865 --> 23:55.959
How did Alexis Drazen
represent himself to you?

23:56.035 --> 23:59.994
He told me he ran
an importing company out of Berlin.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.639
He seemed successful.
He gave me this on our third date.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.203
It must have cost him $10,000. It's real.

24:07.281 --> 24:10.773
Which is more than I can say for him.

24:12.254 --> 24:15.519
- When did you meet him?
- About a month ago, in DC.

24:16.124 --> 24:18.650
I'm with the Senator's Advance Team.

24:19.061 --> 24:22.429
We had some downtime
and a few of us went out for drinks.

24:22.499 --> 24:24.467
So you met him in a bar?

24:26.403 --> 24:31.341
When you're working on a campaign,
you put your life on hold for a year.

24:31.510 --> 24:34.501
There's always people around,
but it's lonely.

24:36.014 --> 24:39.745
You're supposed to meet Mr. Drazen
in his hotel room in about an hour?

24:40.318 --> 24:41.786
That's right.

24:43.022 --> 24:44.421
Miss Nash...

24:46.160 --> 24:49.789
Would you be willing to keep
your appointment with Alexis?

24:49.863 --> 24:53.492
- You want me to spy on him?
- Only if you feel comfortable.

24:53.667 --> 24:57.229
- If you have any doubts at all...
- We'd keep it simple.

24:57.539 --> 25:02.136
We want you to plant a tracking device
on him so we can trace his locations.

25:05.215 --> 25:07.944
It's just the thought of seeing him again.

25:08.017 --> 25:12.352
We would make it so that we could hear
and see everything that took place.

25:12.422 --> 25:14.083
You would be safe.

25:16.627 --> 25:18.356
It's okay, we understand.

25:18.429 --> 25:21.991
Jack, you want to head over to the hotel?
I'll finish debriefing Miss Nash.

25:22.067 --> 25:23.159
Yeah.

25:27.105 --> 25:28.436
Mr. Bauer?

25:29.408 --> 25:32.572
You say that this might help
protect the Senator?

25:34.247 --> 25:37.217
- Yes, I think it would.
- The Senator is perfectly safe.

25:37.284 --> 25:39.445
He's got Secret Service men
with him always.

25:39.521 --> 25:41.886
That didn't stop Alexis
from getting to me, did it?

25:41.956 --> 25:45.484
If they got to me,
they might have gotten to somebody else.

25:50.700 --> 25:53.191
I'll do it.
If something happened to Senator Palmer...

25:53.269 --> 25:56.171
...that I might have prevented,
I could never forgive myself.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.537
So, please...

25:58.108 --> 25:59.769
I have to do this.

26:06.417 --> 26:08.282
He looks familiar, too.

26:08.620 --> 26:11.215
I think I heard them call him Jenson.

26:13.994 --> 26:15.484
Recognize him?

26:20.367 --> 26:21.857
How about him?

26:25.740 --> 26:27.401
You know this one?

26:30.279 --> 26:31.371
Yeah.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.984
He was one of the guards.
I think they called him Eli.

26:38.153 --> 26:40.884
- Can you tell me anything about him?
- No.

26:53.705 --> 26:55.696
Daniels, this is Breeher.

26:59.278 --> 27:01.269
Daniels, this is Breeher.

27:23.773 --> 27:25.364
These rooms with the monitors.

27:25.441 --> 27:27.706
You say they had your father
under surveillance.

27:27.844 --> 27:29.311
From what I saw.

27:29.446 --> 27:30.845
Even at CTU?

27:32.516 --> 27:33.813
I don't know.

27:33.884 --> 27:35.977
What about you, Mrs. Bauer?

27:38.190 --> 27:39.555
Mrs. Bauer?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.723
It's very important
we get through these questions.

27:43.795 --> 27:45.888
Agent Paulson,
I think we need to take a break.

27:45.964 --> 27:47.557
My mom's very tired.

27:48.334 --> 27:49.665
Yes, okay.

28:02.283 --> 28:03.944
Mom, are you okay?

28:12.662 --> 28:13.720
Mom.

28:36.156 --> 28:37.214
Ron.

28:54.843 --> 28:56.607
- Come with me.
- What?

28:56.946 --> 28:58.504
- Let's go.
- Mom.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.715
- Come on, go.
- Come on.

29:11.629 --> 29:12.891
In here.

29:16.869 --> 29:18.359
Lock the door.

29:41.164 --> 29:42.892
Come out with your hands up.

29:42.965 --> 29:45.161
- Don't shoot. I'm coming out.
- Now!

29:45.235 --> 29:46.759
I'm coming out.

29:47.770 --> 29:49.432
Drop the gun!

29:50.941 --> 29:52.875
Get down. Down!

30:00.986 --> 30:02.146
Hurry.

30:16.413 --> 30:17.505
Go!

30:21.920 --> 30:22.944
Get down!

30:57.695 --> 30:59.219
We're ready to go, gentlemen.

30:59.296 --> 31:01.890
I'll fill you in with the rest
when we get to the hotel.

31:01.966 --> 31:04.697
That's where you'll meet the team.
Don't be nervous.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.759
I'll be with you every step of the way.

31:06.837 --> 31:08.203
Jack, I got to talk to you.

31:08.273 --> 31:09.915
Secret Service'll take
you to the helicopter.

31:09.940 --> 31:11.902
I'll be there in one second.

31:11.977 --> 31:13.104
What?

31:13.179 --> 31:16.444
They just found Ellis' body in a men's room
in the French Quarter.

31:20.354 --> 31:23.085
- Do we have any leads yet?
- No, not yet.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.619
Keep me posted.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.868
What are you doing here?

31:33.936 --> 31:36.564
There was no reason to stay.
Teri and Kim are doing fine.

31:36.639 --> 31:39.473
I specifically asked you to stay
to make them feel safe.

31:39.542 --> 31:41.566
They are safe, Jack. I settled them in.

31:41.645 --> 31:43.613
Paulson and Breeher
are taklng care of them...

31:43.680 --> 31:45.910
...and the extra security team is in place.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.813
Hang on, Kim.

32:43.515 --> 32:45.450
- You okay, honey?
- Yeah.

32:46.152 --> 32:47.949
I think we lost them.

32:48.021 --> 32:51.616
I'm just going to go check.
I want you to stay right here, okay?

34:05.075 --> 34:06.565
Ferragamo's dead, isn't he?

34:06.644 --> 34:09.273
- I have no idea.
- Don't try to blow me off, Carl.

34:09.347 --> 34:11.907
The authorities are looking at it.
Let them do their jobs.

34:11.983 --> 34:15.679
- We know they won't find anything.
- I've gone through this with your father.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.745
- My father is his own man and so am I.
- Okay.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.850
- Now you can go through it with me.
- Let's go. What do you need?

34:20.927 --> 34:21.951
Tell me what you need.

34:22.360 --> 34:25.058
Ferragamo was there for me
when nobody else was.

34:25.132 --> 34:27.793
I might not be alive today
if it wasn't for him.

34:27.868 --> 34:30.235
He also betrayed your confidence, Keith.

34:30.304 --> 34:32.237
He's the one
who went to Maureen Kingsley.

34:32.306 --> 34:34.434
That still doesn't justify murder.

34:34.509 --> 34:37.376
What exactly are you hoping to do?
Bring him back to life?

34:37.445 --> 34:39.641
- No, I want justice.
- Justice?

34:40.114 --> 34:42.983
Well, justice is a tricky thing, Keith.

34:43.053 --> 34:46.614
Take Lyle Gibson, for example.
You want justice for that?

34:47.824 --> 34:51.954
- Gibson's death was an accident.
- Maybe so, but let's be objective.

34:52.228 --> 34:55.529
He rapes your sister, you pay him a visit.
He ends up dead.

34:55.600 --> 34:57.899
Accident could be a tough sell.

35:00.239 --> 35:03.209
So if I go public
with the truth about Ferragamo...

35:03.276 --> 35:07.645
...you go public with the lie about
Lyle Gibson? Is that what you're saying?

35:08.448 --> 35:09.881
Oh, brother.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.715
There's one catch here.

35:11.784 --> 35:14.720
There are two cover-ups
and you're involved in both of them...

35:14.788 --> 35:18.156
...so however it plays out is bad for you.
- I can take care of myself.

35:18.226 --> 35:21.525
No. The moneymen behind
my father's campaign take care of you.

35:21.596 --> 35:25.464
If things get ugly, they'll make sure
you're the one who takes the fall.

35:25.533 --> 35:26.831
Won't they, Carl?

35:28.871 --> 35:32.103
Or maybe they'll do to you
what you did to Dr. Ferragamo.

35:32.175 --> 35:34.405
You are in way over your head.

35:35.178 --> 35:38.342
And you're getting nervous. I can smell it.

35:40.351 --> 35:41.818
You listen to me.

35:41.886 --> 35:45.686
Whatever you think you can do
to me or anyone else...

35:45.757 --> 35:48.522
...it will be 100 times worse for you.

35:49.028 --> 35:51.589
- I'm not so sure.
- Well, I am.

35:52.065 --> 35:56.435
Because if you push things too far,
they will do whatever they have to do.

35:56.938 --> 35:59.497
Killing David Palmer's son
might get a little messy.

35:59.572 --> 36:02.098
I think they'd be a little more subtle
than that.

36:03.344 --> 36:05.209
I'm not following you.

36:07.616 --> 36:11.485
There is some physical evidence
in George Ferragamo's office...

36:11.554 --> 36:13.784
...that leads directly to you.

36:14.223 --> 36:17.818
Subtle enough so the fire marshals
didn't find it the first time around...

36:17.894 --> 36:20.796
...but with a little help, they'll find it.

36:22.933 --> 36:25.060
So I'll be framed for Ferragamo's murder.

36:25.135 --> 36:27.434
Like I said, whatever it takes.

36:28.039 --> 36:32.032
That's why your father backed off
and that's why you'll back off.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.965
So I'll be framed
for Ferragamo's murder.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.009
Like I said, whatever it takes.

37:00.810 --> 37:04.473
That's why your father backed off
and that's why you'll back off.

39:16.376 --> 39:17.674
Are you okay?

39:21.750 --> 39:23.546
What happened to you?

39:26.120 --> 39:27.748
What's your name?

39:30.058 --> 39:31.686
I don't remember.

39:33.396 --> 39:35.296
You don't even know your name?

39:43.173 --> 39:46.040
You can't stand in the middle of the road.

39:50.482 --> 39:53.008
Come on, get in. I'll give you a ride.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.451
Thank you.

40:08.202 --> 40:10.865
I'm sorry. Thank you.

41:31.331 --> 41:32.525
Mom!
