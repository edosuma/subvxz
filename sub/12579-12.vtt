WEBVTT

00:31.823 --> 00:35.535
MAN <i>Now, Vijay Singh
with a testy 12-foot putt.</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:38.997
Hey, putta-putta-putta-
putta-putta-putta, swing!

00:38.997 --> 00:40.331
- Shh!
- Hey, man... Ditto.

00:41.750 --> 00:45.962
Hey, Dad, guess who's the star
of the <i>Nursing Home Follies?</i>

00:46.046 --> 00:48.882
Quiet, Bobby. We're watching the Masters.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.925
That's a golf tournament.

00:51.009 --> 00:54.012
I know, the one with the fabulous
green jackets.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.683
MAN <i>Boy, Ken,
you can cut the tension with a knife.</i>

00:59.642 --> 01:02.187
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin'
and he did ride ♪</i>

01:02.187 --> 01:04.314
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh ♪</i>

01:04.314 --> 01:06.232
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride ♪</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:09.694
<i>♪ Uh-huh, uh-huh... ♪</i>

01:09.778 --> 01:11.988
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride ♪</i>

01:12.072 --> 01:14.491
<i>♪ Sword and pistol by his side ♪</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.494
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride ♪</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:20.872
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

01:20.872 --> 01:24.125
Thank you, Garrity & Sons Nursing Home!

01:29.547 --> 01:30.799
Wonderful.

01:34.469 --> 01:37.388
I'm Jerry Popper.
I was on <i>The Tonight Show</i> once.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.766
- Can you spare a minute?
- Can I?

01:40.850 --> 01:42.894
Kid, I'll get right to the point.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.813
I hate living here,

01:44.813 --> 01:48.858
but watching you up on that stage
lighting the place up,

01:48.942 --> 01:52.529
for a moment, it made me forget
the nurse stole my watch.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.990
You got something, kid.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.701
Moxie? Chutzpah? Pizzazz?

01:58.785 --> 02:00.995
Aw, you're selling yourself short.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.292
This is Chip Block, All-American,

02:06.376 --> 02:10.630
and the original, not one
of those plastic Woolworth's copies

02:10.630 --> 02:13.633
that allowed me to retire in such comfort.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.093
Right, Chip?

02:15.093 --> 02:17.846
JERRY Hey, slugger.
Aw, that was my brother's name.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.015
They made him into a baseball bat.
He was from Louisville.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.769
Hey, that dummy's got good timing.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.437
Who are you calling "dummy," dummy?

02:26.521 --> 02:29.983
Settle down, Chip. Chip doesn't like
to be called "dummy."

02:29.983 --> 02:32.485
He prefers the term "carved figure."

02:32.569 --> 02:36.406
Crafted by Masterman's of Wisconsin,
Portuguese cork.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.868
Portuguese cork! That's funny.

02:39.868 --> 02:43.788
Yep, but real ventriloquism
is about more than telling jokes.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.083
It takes great acting, Bobby,
Oscar-caliber,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.918
to play two roles at once.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.630
Nobody could do it today,
except maybe Meryl Streep.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.593
Streep would be a great ventriloquist...
and so would you.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.304
I want you to have him.

03:00.305 --> 03:06.102
I'm going to win the talent show
this year, not that banjo-playing dork.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.104
Whoa, whoa, kid.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.815
You can't just put your hand
inside his body.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.026
You've got to get inside his head.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.778
Who is Chip Block? I'll tell you.

03:15.862 --> 03:20.408
He's the best athlete ever to attend
All-America High.

03:20.408 --> 03:24.120
Every boy wants to be his pal,
every girl wants to be his gal.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.540
But I'm sorry, ladies,
he's saving it for marriage.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.375
An athlete, huh?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.837
I may look big,
but very little of it is muscle.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.047
Chip and I...

03:34.047 --> 03:35.798
...know you can do it, Bobby.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.178
Please, Bobby, the show must go on.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.430
You say that, too?

03:42.430 --> 03:44.349
All right, I'm in.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.767
Thanks, Mr. Popper.

03:46.434 --> 03:50.146
Promise me you'll take care of him.
None of that lemon-scented crap.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.233
- Linseed oil!
- BOBBY I promise.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.818
Not you, Chip. I was talking to B... Oh.

03:55.902 --> 03:59.113
Bravo, Bobby. Bravo.

04:02.325 --> 04:06.871
Hank, what is it about models
that rock stars find so attractive?

04:06.955 --> 04:13.378
Fluttering butterflies. Fluttering
butterflies. Fluttering butterflies.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.713
"Fluttering butterflies"?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.882
Not in this house.

04:17.966 --> 04:22.553
"The fluttering butterflies gracefully
filled the skies in Pacific Grove."

04:22.637 --> 04:25.723
"The fluttering butterflies..."
- Oh, God.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.685
Dad, this is Chip Block.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.728
We're practicing our labials.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.399
New rule. Lights out by 8:30.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.821
Another?

04:39.821 --> 04:41.739
Don't you think you've had enough?

04:41.823 --> 04:43.074
- Another.
- Yes, sir.

04:48.913 --> 04:52.917
My son is playing with dolls.
There, I said it.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.462
He's a sissy. There, I said that.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.550
Sammy Sosa. Sammy Sosa.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.553
Oh, that's a ventriloquist's dummy.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.056
The way people were talking, I thought
you were playing with a Barbie doll.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.226
Mom, meet Chip Block, All-American.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.729
Chip, this is my mom.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.148
I didn't know you had a sister.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.984
Oh, thank you.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.861
Pleased to meet you, Chip.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.744
Yeah, that's really all
the material we have.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.663
The problem is,
Chip likes the sports pages,

05:30.747 --> 05:33.791
but I'm more of an arts-and-leisure guy.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.461
I don't even know how to read a box score.

05:36.461 --> 05:39.047
Well, then, a league-leading
softball pitcher

05:39.047 --> 05:40.673
will be the one to teach you.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.425
Let me just get a sports page.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.678
Okay, now, "E.R.A.,"

05:45.762 --> 05:48.848
as you see here,
is my "Earned Run Average,"

05:48.848 --> 05:50.892
which is very, very good.

05:50.892 --> 05:55.271
- What does "H.B.P." mean?
- "Hit By Pitch."

05:55.355 --> 05:56.773
She was crowding the plate.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.984
Hank said I could get some cereal.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.779
Oh, I'll never forget this. In this game,

06:02.779 --> 06:04.655
I had a no-hitter...

06:04.739 --> 06:06.657
PEGGY
If you'll adjust the two Hs to Es

06:06.741 --> 06:08.368
signifying they were actually errors,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.536
which a less jealous scorer
would have ruled them.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.546
"Who was the last pitcher
to win 30 games?"

06:20.630 --> 06:24.175
Denny McLain, Detroit Tigers, 1968.

06:24.175 --> 06:27.637
That's day-one stuff, Chip.
Give me a hard one.

06:27.637 --> 06:32.392
Okay, wise guy. How many years
did he get for pension fraud?

06:32.392 --> 06:36.229
Ooh, you got me... unless it was eight.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.064
You're the man.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.484
MAN
<i>And the ball is going... going...</i>

06:41.484 --> 06:44.445
<i>It's... foul. Foul ball.</i>

06:44.529 --> 06:48.616
Uh... Bobby, maybe you and your...
action figure

06:48.616 --> 06:50.284
want to go clean your room.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.622
Could you please blow your smoke
the other way, Mr. Gribble?

06:54.622 --> 06:57.291
I'm training for the varsity squad.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.890
- I get Dale's spot.
- What's with Dale?

07:12.974 --> 07:17.019
He's like an L.A. fan,
leaving in the seventh inning.

07:18.062 --> 07:21.315
- Boy, this new manager sure is methodical.
- Yeah.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.943
People criticize him
for playing little ball,

07:23.943 --> 07:27.947
but I say a "W" is a "W"
any way you get it.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.327
Oh, come on.
My grandmother hits like that.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.997
God, I hate infield singles.

07:35.997 --> 07:40.668
They put your tying run on first,
Mr. Hill. Got to like that.

07:40.668 --> 07:41.961
Yeah.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.256
Hey... hey, that's true, Bobby...
and, uh...

07:45.256 --> 07:49.927
Chip. Chip Block.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Hill.

07:50.011 --> 07:53.806
- How do you do that, Bobby?
- He's using show business.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.684
Palmeiro's going to be looking
for a fastball.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.563
All right.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.814
Yeah!

08:01.898 --> 08:03.608
MAN <i>Palmeiro got a fastball.</i>

08:03.608 --> 08:06.736
- Hey, you called it, Chip.
- Chip's a genius.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.323
Bobby, Chip, you get Dale's spot. Bill...

08:10.323 --> 08:12.742
I couldn't handle the pressure anyway.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.746
Could be... could be... It is!

08:16.746 --> 08:20.500
Round tripper!
He's going to tag all the bags!

08:20.500 --> 08:23.002
All right!

08:23.586 --> 08:26.172
I love this guy.

08:31.385 --> 08:35.431
Enjoy your last few breaths, dummy.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.488
You're looking lovely this morning
as usual, Mrs. Hill.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.241
Well, thank you.

08:53.241 --> 08:57.745
I'll have cinnamon rolls,
pancakes, Seven-up, bacon...

08:57.745 --> 09:02.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Bobby,
if you're going to bulk up, do it right.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.545
You want five raw eggs in a glass.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.423
Raw eggs? Haven't you heard of salmonella?

09:09.507 --> 09:12.218
Relax, kid. If I wanted to kill you,

09:12.218 --> 09:14.929
I'd challenge you to a push-up contest!

09:16.389 --> 09:19.433
- Yeah.
- Eggs it is.

09:19.517 --> 09:23.479
Mr. Hill, could you pass
the sports section, please?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.482
Sure. You gonna make fun
of tennis there, Chip?

09:27.233 --> 09:31.279
Oh, I think tennis does a pretty good job
of making fun of itself.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.198
Ain't that the truth?

09:44.208 --> 09:46.335
KIDS
<i>♪ Someone's got a birthday ♪</i>

09:46.419 --> 09:48.504
<i>♪ I wonder who? ♪</i>

09:48.588 --> 09:51.924
<i>♪ I think it's you ♪</i>

09:55.803 --> 10:00.057
Now let's see what Daddy got for you.
Bug, get Dale his gift.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.894
Happy birthday, Squirt.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.329
Shug, are you all right?
- Fine!

10:23.539 --> 10:27.168
Sh-shah!

10:46.854 --> 10:51.400
Octavio, I want you to do
the exact same thing I just did

10:51.484 --> 10:54.320
to this picture to this guy in person.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.073
Except do it right here.

10:57.073 --> 11:01.202
Okay, I'm going to need $20 now
and $20 when it is done.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.287
And another $20 for expenses.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.629
Well, tee time is in two hours
and eight minutes.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.091
So, in other words,
you're going to be leaving the house.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.843
Yes, Dale, we're all going golfing,
remember?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.805
Well, I can't go. I got plans.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.391
Yeah. Plans.

11:24.308 --> 11:25.351
I mean, nothing!

11:26.185 --> 11:29.897
Hello, Mr. Gribble. Nice to see you.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.066
Nice to see you again.

11:37.321 --> 11:40.324
Hey, uh, we got a spot open today
for golfing.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.284
How'd you like to join our foursome?

11:42.368 --> 11:46.872
Uh, no thanks, Mr. Hill.
I'm going to hang out here today.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.959
Maybe, uh, run some wind sprints.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.795
Aw, come on, Chip.
I'll let you drive the cart.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.881
Maybe even fix you up with my three wood.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.555
Bobby, Chip, let's go.

12:11.021 --> 12:14.900
11:15 a.m. The man and the boy
and the puppet leave the house.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.742
11:16. Octavio speaks into tape recorder,

12:23.409 --> 12:27.037
thus leaving crucial evidence,
stupid idiot!

12:27.121 --> 12:30.750
Octavio must be gotten rid of.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.548
"Dear Octavio.

12:37.548 --> 12:42.261
This is the hardest letter
I've ever had to write."

12:47.433 --> 12:50.186
Silence on the tee!

12:50.186 --> 12:54.023
- Keep your left arm straight.
- Mm-hmm.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.112
Yes!

13:00.196 --> 13:04.867
Uh, uh, actually,
Bobby told me about that one.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.286
Aw, Chip, you modest son of a gun.

13:07.286 --> 13:11.123
What'll you have, Chip?
Can of Thompson's water seal?

13:16.253 --> 13:19.131
Hmm. Hello.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.387
Help!

13:28.516 --> 13:29.892
Can I help you?

13:30.601 --> 13:33.604
Yes. I would like to purchase
some chloroform,

13:33.604 --> 13:37.775
a roll of duct tape,
and this gagging bandanna.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.405
Oh, dang! Looks like a penalty stroke.

13:43.489 --> 13:47.284
Oh, no, sir!
That's a temporary water hazard.

13:47.368 --> 13:51.121
Free drop no nearer to the hole,
no penalty.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.540
Oh, well, all right.

13:52.540 --> 13:54.875
How'd you learn so much about golf?

13:54.959 --> 13:57.920
I've seen <i>Happy Gilmore</i> 50 times.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.172
I hate Adam Sandler.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.632
Oh...

14:01.632 --> 14:04.677
Yeah. He's all poo-poo jokes.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.346
You don't have to work blue to be funny.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.848
Amen to that.

14:08.848 --> 14:13.477
Dad, I'm starting to get
a ventriloquist's tan.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.273
No one likes a whiner, Bobby. Right, Chip?

14:20.276 --> 14:21.652
Right.

14:31.745 --> 14:32.997
Mr. Popper?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.086
Caught you in the act!

14:39.086 --> 14:41.171
Oh, oh, it's you, kid.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.258
I thought it was that thieving nurse
coming back for the other cufflink.

14:44.258 --> 14:46.552
I hope I'm not disturbing you, sir.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.263
He was disturbed before you got here.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.974
Oh... oh...

14:51.974 --> 14:53.726
Sorry. Old habits.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.645
So... how is that crazy wooden bastard?

14:56.729 --> 15:00.232
Oh, great, great. Everybody loves Chip.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.778
It's just... well,
when you and Chip were partners,

15:04.862 --> 15:08.866
did you ever get the feeling that
the audience liked him better than you?

15:08.866 --> 15:12.995
Of course. Chip was the star.
And he got paid better, too.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.625
That's a joke from my act.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.711
- That didn't make you crazy?
- Oh, of course it did.

15:20.711 --> 15:23.380
I wanted to be known
for more than just Chip Block.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.675
At one point, I even shelved him
and hit the road solo.

15:26.759 --> 15:30.763
I did sound effects. I was the first guy
to do "windshield wipers."

15:37.895 --> 15:40.522
A few weeks later,
the audience stopped coming.

15:40.606 --> 15:43.567
After my second cry for help,
I decided it was better

15:43.651 --> 15:46.528
to be on the edge of the spotlight
than not be there at all.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.989
Yeah, I hear you.

15:49.073 --> 15:52.618
Well, it's almost 4:00.
I'll let you get ready for dinner.

15:52.618 --> 15:56.872
Do me a favor, will you?
Tell the nurse you couldn't find me.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.795
JERRY
I'm gonna get that thieving slut.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.881
Hey, Bobby,
I'm heading over to the hardware store,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.759
and I bet the guys there
would get a kick out of Chip's

16:08.759 --> 16:11.887
"Jimmy Johnson varnishing his hair"
routine.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.890
The show must go on.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.775
Dad! Dad! Chip is gone!

16:24.775 --> 16:26.944
Is this part of your new act?

16:27.653 --> 16:28.612
I don't get it.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.573
I don't where he is,
but there were signs of a struggle.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.201
Think. Now retrace your steps.

16:35.494 --> 16:39.498
Get him!
No!

16:43.002 --> 16:44.753
DALE

16:46.839 --> 16:48.257
Dale, are you nuts?

16:51.677 --> 16:54.138
You'll never put that creep back together.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.890
I mixed him in with two chairs
and a toboggan.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.020
You're next!
I'm kicking your ass through that thing!

17:02.062 --> 17:05.315
You wouldn't hit an unconscious man...

17:10.195 --> 17:12.197
I think I'm going to be sick.

17:13.323 --> 17:16.910
You know what?
Maybe this is all for the best.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.664
Huh. Maybe you're right.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.042
What do we really need Chip for, anyway?

17:23.042 --> 17:26.670
- Now you're talking, Dad!
- Yep, think about it.

17:26.754 --> 17:30.466
If we build a new Chip,
we could make him perfect.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.634
Don't get me wrong, Chip was great,

17:32.718 --> 17:35.554
but his neck wasn't really thick enough
to play football.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.514
At least not competitively.

17:37.598 --> 17:41.268
And if his ears didn't stick out so much,
he could wear a helmet.

17:41.268 --> 17:45.939
I'll be at my workbench cobbling together
something I can be proud of.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.823
Hey, Bobby, catch.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.077
Well, the spring-loaded arm
needs a little tightening,

17:58.077 --> 18:01.914
but the new Chip will finally
be able to throw a football.

18:01.914 --> 18:06.043
You know, Dad, I could just use my sock
and a magic marker.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.504
A sock never had an arm like this

18:08.504 --> 18:12.424
or legs that could scramble
like Roger "The Dodger" Staubach's.

18:12.508 --> 18:16.553
And I bet that sock
doesn't have Troy Aikman's jawline.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.138
Okay.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.515
It'll be fun, Bobby.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.434
It's kind of like I'm building you
a big brother.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.937
Yeah.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.314
Okay.

18:27.314 --> 18:28.482
Let's see here.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.364
Sorry, Bobby,
but I can't tighten that arm.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.873
Hey, Dad, this yahoo thinks the Rangers

18:44.957 --> 18:48.752
are "philosophically"
a National League team.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.879
Ha! Yahoo.

18:50.963 --> 18:55.843
That's fine. Hey, Peggy,
what gets out 32-year-old blood?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.010
Club soda, right?

18:57.094 --> 19:02.391
Well, I'm going to go watch the Rangers
philosophically kick the Yankees' butts.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.227
I'll watch the game. Anybody else in?

19:05.227 --> 19:10.440
Not me. I've got to spiff up my old
Pop Warner jersey for Chip Number Two.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.160
Hey, Peggy, you know that hair
we always find in the drain?

19:21.160 --> 19:23.162
You don't just throw that out, do you?

19:23.162 --> 19:26.415
Wait a minute. Bill!
He has bags of hair at his house.

19:26.415 --> 19:30.377
Hank, your son is outside
throwing a football in the air

19:30.377 --> 19:32.963
and trying his damndest to catch it.

19:32.963 --> 19:37.509
Maybe he'd get a few less bruises
if you spent some time with him.

19:37.593 --> 19:41.305
That's why I'm trying
to finish the new Chip ASAP,

19:41.305 --> 19:44.558
so we can start spending
more time with Bobby again.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.936
Well, all right, then.
I will let you play with your doll.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.939
Oh, and you know,
if there's any lumber leftover,

19:51.023 --> 19:54.151
you might want to use it to build the wife
you've always wanted, too.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.574
And Staubach goes back to throw.
He's in the pocket.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.001
Hmm.

20:18.300 --> 20:22.721
Hey, Dad. I got Mr. Dauterive's
old Pop Warner jersey.

20:22.721 --> 20:26.350
You know, for the act. Me and Chip II.

20:26.350 --> 20:30.687
I mean, Chip II and me.
You got to give the star top billing.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.398
Yeah, but I think in this case,

20:33.482 --> 20:37.653
you'll agree both stars
deserve top billing.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.613
It looks just like me.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.199
It's even got my haircut.

20:42.199 --> 20:46.245
Yeah, I've still got a few more
holes to drill along the scalp,

20:46.245 --> 20:48.705
you know, to even out the hairline.

20:48.789 --> 20:53.001
Hey, these are my short pants
from when I was three!

20:53.085 --> 20:55.212
Yeah, I found them in my rag bag.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.089
I don't know, Dad.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.801
Short pants don't really belong
on a football field.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.428
That's okay. You don't either.

21:04.972 --> 21:08.058
Hey, isn't <i>Iron Chef</i> on?

21:08.058 --> 21:10.435
Yeah, let's go watch <i>Iron Chef.</i>

21:10.519 --> 21:14.523
Uh, you know, the Rangers
are playing the Yankees right now.

21:14.523 --> 21:19.194
<i>Iron Chef! Iron Chef!</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:21.780
Sorry, Dad, it's two against one.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.740
Yeah, I guess you're right.

21:23.824 --> 21:26.868
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin'
and he did ride, uh-huh ♪</i>

21:26.952 --> 21:28.287
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

21:28.287 --> 21:30.747
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin'
and he did ride, uh-huh ♪</i>

21:30.831 --> 21:31.832
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

21:31.832 --> 21:34.376
Look, Peggy.

21:34.376 --> 21:38.255
Look at me with my two sons.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.300
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride ♪</i>

21:41.300 --> 21:43.969
<i>♪ Sword and pistol by his side ♪</i>

21:43.969 --> 21:47.055
<i>♪ Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride ♪</i>

21:47.139 --> 21:50.392
<i>♪ Uh-huh ♪</i>

21:57.858 --> 21:59.860
"Dear Octavio.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.987
It has come to my attention

22:01.987 --> 22:07.367
that a man claiming to be Dale Gribble
recently fired you."

22:07.451 --> 22:09.202
<i>Perimeter breach!</i>

22:09.286 --> 22:10.454
Perimeter breach?

22:18.712 --> 22:22.174
You'll never catch Dale Gri...

22:23.175 --> 22:25.385
You were right, Bobbies.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.220
Ventriloquism is fun.
