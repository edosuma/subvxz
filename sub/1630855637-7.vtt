WEBVTT

00:00.167 --> 00:02.002
<i>Before the eyes
of the Gods,</i>

00:02.002 --> 00:05.798
I anoint you Dumnonia's ruler
and Britain's defender!

00:07.842 --> 00:09.844
<i>I will try to bring
peace to this isle,</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.471
but I will do it my way.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.140
You told me once
you wanted to serve me.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.891
- Yes.
- Then that settles it.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.643
- You're to be my man.
- You won't regret it.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.146
We can't submit to Dumnonia.

00:20.146 --> 00:21.355
There will be no submission.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.023
You have a daughter.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.358
Let us be joined in marriage.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.153
An alliance.
Blood of each other's blood.

00:27.153 --> 00:29.405
<i>An attack on any one of us
is an attack on us all.</i>

00:29.405 --> 00:30.656
<i>Why is he doing this?</i>

00:30.656 --> 00:31.991
He believes
it's right for Britain.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.743
Yeah, but is it
right for him?

00:34.827 --> 00:36.746
<i>My daughter is
everything to me now.</i>

00:36.746 --> 00:39.498
<i>I won't let her down.</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:42.543
- Who are you?
- This is Lady Guinevere

00:42.543 --> 00:43.878
of Henis Wyren.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.404
Ah, what is this?

01:13.282 --> 01:15.785
- Oats and water.
- Oats and water?

01:15.785 --> 01:17.036
That's disgusting.

01:17.036 --> 01:18.579
How long are we
staying here for?

01:18.579 --> 01:20.080
King Gorfydd's druid

01:20.080 --> 01:22.458
says the moon will be full
in three days.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.043
Then we can take

01:24.043 --> 01:26.712
the beautiful Princess Ceinwyn
back to Caer Cadarn

01:26.712 --> 01:28.130
and give us some proper food.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.591
Arthur, we need to hurry.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.051
King Gorfydd's waiting for us.

01:32.051 --> 01:33.427
Derfel.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.305
Go to the gardens here.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.432
If they have any
hawberries, pick some.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.934
Is one of the horses lame?

01:41.227 --> 01:42.812
Make it into an ointment.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.209
How many languages
do you speak, Arthur?

02:07.211 --> 02:10.256
British tongue.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.258
A bit of Gallic. That's all.

02:12.258 --> 02:16.762
I suppose Uther never
educated you.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.931
Greek and Latin writers
are great thinkers.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.517
My son Cuneglas
is abroad at the moment.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.310
He sent this to me.

02:25.604 --> 02:30.359
A guide on how a man should lead
his life.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.821
And these...

02:33.821 --> 02:36.824
are the letters of St. Patrick
I spoke of, Bishop.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.159
Ah.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.911
What?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.206
I didn't expect this of you.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.375
What, an interest
in foreign cultures,

02:46.375 --> 02:48.627
or toleration
of Christianity?

02:48.627 --> 02:50.045
Both.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.924
I have many artefacts
from all over the world. Look.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.346
Come.

03:04.560 --> 03:11.901
This depicts animals that
hunt far from our shores. See?

03:11.901 --> 03:16.071
And these I'm particularly
proud of, from Britain itself.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.367
Gold, from Strathcloda.

03:21.577 --> 03:22.661
Can you see the seams?

03:22.661 --> 03:23.537
Mm.

03:26.332 --> 03:29.376
Ah, this, from Corinium.

03:31.295 --> 03:34.006
Our isle has many gifts
to offer us.

03:34.006 --> 03:37.092
I'd like to know more
about Britain.

03:37.092 --> 03:39.845
Merlin taught me a great deal,
of course, but--

03:39.845 --> 03:43.015
There's always more to learn.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.017
I shall enjoy teaching
you, Arthur.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.519
Uther was a fool
not to see your potential.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.897
But that's enough history
for one day.

03:49.897 --> 03:54.360
Now, Bishop, stay,
read to your heart's content.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.403
We have wedding matters
to discuss.

04:42.366 --> 04:43.659
Derfel, right?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.292
What do you want?

05:08.517 --> 05:10.477
The exchange
of the lovers' rings

05:10.477 --> 05:13.188
will take place
at the great hall.

05:13.188 --> 05:16.275
My druid will then pronounce
you married under the full moon.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.652
After, you and Ceinwyn
will be brought here.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.114
My wife Nesta and I consummated
our marriage in this chamber.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.950
We were blessed
with conceiving Cuneglas

05:24.950 --> 05:26.952
on the first night
of our loving.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.162
Hmm.

05:33.917 --> 05:38.505
If you wish, you may place
your fertility offerings here.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.841
Whatever works for you both.

05:43.427 --> 05:45.137
Princess Ceinwyn,
how are you this morning?

05:45.137 --> 05:47.473
Well, my Lord.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.349
And you?

05:49.349 --> 05:50.934
I'm very well.

05:53.395 --> 05:57.149
How bright
you shone last night.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.567
You certainly lived up to your name.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.819
The Star of Powys.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.529
Why do they call you
the Star of Powys?

06:04.073 --> 06:06.366
Suits you very well,
of course.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.202
My mother.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.369
It was her name for me.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.915
Sorry to hear of
her passing.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.502
I miss her always.

06:16.502 --> 06:20.255
She took her last breath
in my arms.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.720
I lost my mother, too.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.723
Whatever age it happens...

06:31.433 --> 06:32.559
it's hard.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.939
You found them.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.690
They were growing
down by the stream.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.983
I almost fell in.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.570
My King. Lord.

06:43.570 --> 06:46.031
Lady Guinevere,
always a story to tell, eh?

06:47.366 --> 06:48.867
I could hardly get up
this morning,

06:48.867 --> 06:51.286
but Guinevere was awake
at dawn.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.247
I know, she's
a torrent of energy!

06:53.247 --> 06:55.541
What will we do without her?

06:55.541 --> 06:57.209
You're leaving?

06:57.209 --> 06:59.086
She's coming with us.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.671
To Caer Cadarn?

07:02.005 --> 07:03.423
It's still to be discussed.

07:06.301 --> 07:09.388
We shall leave you to
your tasks.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.515
See you later tonight
for the feast.

07:15.352 --> 07:17.896
I have some ointment
for your horse.

07:17.896 --> 07:18.939
I'll bring it
to the stables.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.992
So, Guinevere's done
it again.

07:32.828 --> 07:36.331
No need to hide it.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.834
When it comes to Guinevere,
a fair few of these men

07:38.834 --> 07:41.253
have lost their heart to her.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.172
And I don't know
what else besides.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.758
Even I've been victim
to her charms.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.260
'Course I knew she
didn't want me,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.304
she wanted her lands back
and thought I could help her.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.184
Why is she so close to
the princess

07:55.184 --> 07:56.643
if you have
a low opinion of her?

07:58.562 --> 08:01.815
Because she loves Ceinwyn
like a sister.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.485
And she amuses me.

08:20.542 --> 08:25.964
Wulfric!

08:29.384 --> 08:31.303
Wulfric!

08:39.686 --> 08:41.521
<i>Wulfric!</i>

08:45.609 --> 08:46.526
There you are.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.950
I am not sure how bad
Llamrei's leg really is.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.995
Although...

08:56.995 --> 09:00.332
now you've made the ointment,
I suppose...

09:00.332 --> 09:02.209
it's worth going to
the stables and checking.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.300
There you are, my Lord.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.888
Is everything well?

09:18.141 --> 09:19.393
Derfel?

09:21.937 --> 09:23.480
It's Gundleus.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.365
I know how difficult
it must be

09:33.365 --> 09:35.701
being in his presence.

09:35.701 --> 09:41.540
- What he did to Nimue--
- There's more.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.749
It was him.

09:46.962 --> 09:48.463
That night.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.092
Gundleus took my mother.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.431
He threw you
in that death pit?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.392
I'll never forget his face.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.102
He was the last person
that I saw.

10:06.148 --> 10:08.317
Before you found me.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.818
How long have you known?

10:09.818 --> 10:12.612
Since the bastard
came to Caer Cadarn.

10:12.612 --> 10:18.076
And you stayed away
from him all this time.

10:18.076 --> 10:21.079
Derfel,
I'm very proud of you.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.831
When you took Gundleus prisoner,

10:22.831 --> 10:25.292
you stopped me from
killing him.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.839
I saw that things
could be done...

10:32.424 --> 10:33.508
in a different way.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.136
Restraint.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.639
What we all strive for.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.641
Sometimes it's hard though.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.145
Believe me, I know.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.153
Take that to the stables for me.

10:55.197 --> 10:56.823
There's a white horse there.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.659
If his mistress is there...

11:04.206 --> 11:06.041
Just take it, please.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.491
You're Arthur's man.

11:39.491 --> 11:42.702
An ointment for your horse,
from my lord.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.038
Kind of him.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.041
But tell your lord neither I
nor my horse need his charity.

12:05.183 --> 12:07.519
Do you like him?

12:07.519 --> 12:08.520
Who?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.813
Arthur.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.525
I barely know him.

12:13.525 --> 12:16.278
Well, I like him.

12:17.946 --> 12:20.782
He's better than Gundleus,

12:20.782 --> 12:22.951
or all those other men that
Father was considering for me.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.538
Let's not think of them.
Especially Gundleus.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.503
I
feel a kindness in him.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.756
This marriage
might just work.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.722
Guinevere?

12:43.722 --> 12:44.973
Yes?

12:47.392 --> 12:50.270
Will it... hurt?

13:00.822 --> 13:02.157
He'll be kind to you.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.757
St. Patrick's letters
are extraordinary.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.800
And the fact that
King Gorfydd has them...

13:23.678 --> 13:26.973
You--you think God is
calling the King, Bedwin?

13:26.973 --> 13:29.017
I've heard an abbot's
running a monastery

13:29.017 --> 13:31.186
outside Ratae,
converting by the hundreds.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.772
'The kingdom of God has
come near.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.358
Repent and believe
the good news.' I told you.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.159
Ratae is
on their eastern border.

13:47.244 --> 13:50.580
They're staring
Saxon invasion in the face.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.833
Could be that Gorfydd's
allowing Christianity

13:53.833 --> 13:56.503
to keep up the courage of
the people.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.175
- But still...
- But still.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.595
God is calling Powys.
He's calling Powys.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.642
- Tread lightly.
- Of course.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.352
Of course.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.040
Our kitchen has been
busy preparing

14:34.040 --> 14:35.667
all the delicacies
of Powys.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.383
You look very
beautiful tonight.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.051
Thank you.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.929
Which of your men is
without a wife, Arthur?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.515
Most of them. Why?

14:50.515 --> 14:53.518
Lady Guinevere needs a husband
if she's to travel south.

14:53.518 --> 14:55.353
Father,
don't tease Guinevere.

14:56.771 --> 14:58.440
I haven't said I'll go yet.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.691
I'm not sure I can
wrench myself

14:59.691 --> 15:02.193
away from you,
King Gorfydd.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.112
She has no dowry.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.406
But as you see, her wits
are on offer,

15:06.406 --> 15:08.241
amongst other assets.

15:11.453 --> 15:12.871
Any man would be proud

15:12.871 --> 15:14.247
to make you his wife,
Lady Guinevere.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.583
What's your name, Lord?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.044
Hear that?
She called me a lord.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.295
Lanval.

15:20.295 --> 15:23.965
And I am no lord.
I am just a man.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.759
Just a man is fine by me.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.690
I hope the bastard chokes.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.319
All this for him.

15:44.319 --> 15:46.071
Why doesn't my uncle
see his ambition?

15:46.071 --> 15:48.239
Calm yourself.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.116
This is good for us.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.411
Arthur is good for us.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.996
He locked us up.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.790
Then he let us go.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.626
Now look at him.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.046
Sitting next to Gorfydd as if
he's his firstborn son.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.009
This way you no longer
have to marry Ceinwyn;

16:08.009 --> 16:09.636
you can marry me.

16:12.097 --> 16:16.101
We'll be
King and Queen of Siluria,

16:16.101 --> 16:17.936
protected by Arthur's
new peace

16:17.936 --> 16:19.479
and included
in his alliance.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.068
There's a new order brewing...

16:26.903 --> 16:28.655
and we must be a part of it.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.625
It's wonderful to see
the hall full again.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.836
So many strangers
becoming friends.

16:44.045 --> 16:44.921
Mm.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.303
What about us?

16:52.303 --> 16:54.389
Are we leading by example?

16:54.389 --> 16:56.683
Well, the deal's
done on us, my Lord.

16:57.892 --> 16:59.519
How very business-minded
of you.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.231
And talking
of business,

17:03.231 --> 17:06.192
Guinevere does need a husband.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.694
Is your man suitable?

17:13.074 --> 17:15.827
Perhaps.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.579
What is Lady Guinevere
looking for?

17:19.289 --> 17:21.666
She doesn't think she
wants to be married.

17:21.666 --> 17:22.959
She doesn't really
have to be.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.423
But if she found
the right person--

17:28.423 --> 17:30.258
independent-minded...

17:30.258 --> 17:32.218
generous-spirited...

17:33.762 --> 17:35.054
her equal.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.771
Not so easy to find.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.779
Let's go and talk to them.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.751
I know what
I'm going to do.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.711
I'm going to ask Arthur,
because he will know.

18:06.711 --> 18:09.047
- It's true.
- No, I don't believe you.

18:09.047 --> 18:11.466
My Lord, Lady Guinevere
tells me that

18:11.466 --> 18:13.051
this is made of seaweed.

18:13.051 --> 18:16.221
Laverbread.
Of course it is.

18:16.221 --> 18:18.556
- Shall I eat it?
- Ask your lord.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.141
I for one think
it's important not to

18:20.141 --> 18:22.227
shy away from
new experiences.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.979
It depends what
the repercussions are.

18:24.979 --> 18:27.232
Indecision
is so unattractive.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.775
Could be seen
as self-control.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.109
Or cowardice.

18:31.236 --> 18:33.404
Well, a coward I am not.

18:33.404 --> 18:35.657
So, even though
it looks like

18:35.657 --> 18:37.909
a horse made a
in my hand,

18:37.909 --> 18:39.035
here goes, eh?

18:41.871 --> 18:42.956
Oh.

18:44.332 --> 18:45.917
All right. Not bad.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.418
You see?
In my opinion,

18:47.418 --> 18:49.504
you rarely regret the actions
you take.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.047
Just the ones you don't.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.655
What is
your quarrel with me?

19:17.240 --> 19:18.324
No quarrel.

19:19.868 --> 19:22.036
My lord is here in peace.
So am I.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.205
Avalon's forgotten then?

19:24.205 --> 19:25.456
No. Not forgotten,

19:25.456 --> 19:26.833
just not for now.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.503
I have to ask you something.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.339
Where did you get
that knife from?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.179
King Gundleus
gave it to me.

19:42.307 --> 19:43.892
It was my mother's.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.811
It can't be.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.897
Gundleus pillaged
a Dumnonian settlement

19:48.897 --> 19:50.565
eight summers ago.

19:52.233 --> 19:55.820
He took a Saxon slave,
my mother,

19:55.820 --> 19:58.573
and that is the knife
that she fed me with.

19:58.573 --> 20:00.533
It is mine by right.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.870
I don't believe you.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.997
How would you have survived?

20:05.997 --> 20:09.125
Gundleus threw me
into a death pit,

20:10.752 --> 20:12.253
but I lived.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.213
That's not possible.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.821
Take it...

20:40.031 --> 20:41.616
if it is yours.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.906
I hope it works.
It does on my horse.

22:05.116 --> 22:07.952
I thought I might as
well put it on, as you made it.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.370
I didn't make it.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.206
My man Derfel did.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.506
Sorry I never came.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.887
Why didn't you?

22:26.971 --> 22:30.349
Normally I make a decision,
I follow it through.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.729
But this...

22:38.149 --> 22:40.735
One moment I want to
be with you, the next I don't.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.239
Then when I see you...

22:45.239 --> 22:46.365
I can't stop
looking at you.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.036
I hear you're coming
to Caer Cadarn

22:50.036 --> 22:51.913
and I am exploding with joy...

22:54.248 --> 22:55.750
Then I think of Ceinwyn.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.129
Do you want
to come to Caer Cadarn?

23:01.589 --> 23:03.549
I can't think
of anything worse.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.219
Why?

23:09.138 --> 23:10.431
Tell me.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.726
I love Ceinwyn.

23:16.104 --> 23:20.358
But she always, always
gets what I want.

23:52.306 --> 23:53.349
No!

23:55.977 --> 23:57.436
We're betraying Ceinwyn.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.897
I don't care.

23:59.897 --> 24:01.440
Gorfydd will.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.779
That's not just a truth,
Arthur, it's a warning.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.325
What do you mean?

24:13.578 --> 24:15.454
We mustn't meet again.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.962
It's tradition,
isn't it, in Powys...

24:24.672 --> 24:26.382
to keep a lock
of your lover's hair?

25:17.725 --> 25:19.518
You wanted
to see me, Father.

25:21.646 --> 25:24.523
The moon will shine bright
and strong tomorrow night.

25:26.067 --> 25:29.028
A good omen for
resources and status.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.530
Now, what about your cycle?
When was your last bleed?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.574
Twelve days ago.

25:33.574 --> 25:36.244
You could leave Powys
with a child in your belly.

25:36.244 --> 25:39.038
A girl would be nice.
Granddaughter for you.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.831
Pray for a boy.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.541
Why does it matter?

25:42.541 --> 25:45.419
Any children Arthur and I have
won't be direct heirs.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.171
Mordred's already king
of Dumnonia.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.882
The High King is
unlikely to live long.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.010
He's a cripple, weak.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.845
It's just his foot.
Arthur says--

25:54.845 --> 25:56.597
Oh, Arthur says?

25:56.597 --> 25:59.183
It's like that, is it?
Can't stop saying his name?

26:00.726 --> 26:03.437
You will make
Arthur a happy man too,

26:03.437 --> 26:05.439
if you give him a son.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.402
Now, go.

26:16.117 --> 26:18.202
What about Arthur
making me happy?

26:18.202 --> 26:20.413
Every wife deserves that.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.875
Where is it
you get these ideas?

26:24.875 --> 26:27.461
I watched
my mother and you.

26:27.461 --> 26:31.048
My little kitten
bearing her claws.

26:31.048 --> 26:34.969
I wish you much joy
in your marriage.

26:41.809 --> 26:43.853
I wanna speak to you, Uncle. Lady.

26:52.653 --> 26:54.113
Disappointed
she won't be yours?

26:55.823 --> 26:58.409
She was promised to me,
by you.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.785
Oh, hardly promised.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.912
You were just one of many
possible husbands.

27:01.912 --> 27:03.748
It's certainly out of the
question now, isn't it?

27:03.748 --> 27:05.499
Haven't you heard your
whispered name?

27:05.499 --> 27:08.586
"Queen Killer."

27:08.586 --> 27:12.506
I raided Avalon,
for us, on your instructions.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.925
There's a difference
between a raid and a massacre!

27:14.925 --> 27:17.011
You said kill the baby!

27:17.011 --> 27:18.846
I said take the baby!

27:18.846 --> 27:20.348
And as for murdering Norwenna,

27:20.348 --> 27:23.476
and raping the druidess...

27:23.476 --> 27:25.102
I think we should
see less of each other.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.854
Now, why don't you marry
that woman of yours

27:26.854 --> 27:28.272
and return to Siluria?

27:28.272 --> 27:30.983
Oh, I will. I will, Uncle.
I intend to.

27:30.983 --> 27:33.778
But I want to marry Ladwys
under the same full moon

27:33.778 --> 27:36.530
as my cousin Ceinwyn
and Arthur Ap Neb,

27:36.530 --> 27:37.615
here, in Caer Dolforwyn.

27:39.367 --> 27:42.119
Yes.

27:42.119 --> 27:43.829
This is what I've
always liked about you,

27:43.829 --> 27:44.997
is your sense of humor!

27:44.997 --> 27:47.875
It's my right, and hers!

27:47.875 --> 27:50.044
Ladwys was kept prisoner
by that bastard Arthur,

27:50.044 --> 27:51.796
and she suffered.
She suffered.

27:51.796 --> 27:52.963
That's what mistresses do,

27:52.963 --> 27:54.840
they suffer for their
masters!

27:54.840 --> 27:56.801
And I killed for you.
I butchered for you.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.344
For what?!

28:00.096 --> 28:01.347
Why don't you go now?

28:01.347 --> 28:04.642
Go back to Siluria, go on.
Indulge yourself.

28:04.642 --> 28:08.854
Go on. Rut, maim,
kill whoever you want!

28:10.731 --> 28:13.692
But do it
within your own borders!

28:13.692 --> 28:15.528
Don't feel the need
to bother me with it!

28:35.423 --> 28:37.216
Nothing.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.551
It was all for nothing.

28:41.929 --> 28:43.180
Your uncle won't
see us married here?

28:43.180 --> 28:45.641
He doesn't <i>see</i> me at all!

28:47.768 --> 28:49.728
I've shed an ocean of
blood for him.

28:51.105 --> 28:52.440
Him and his promises.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.736
So, we go back to Siluria.
Get married there.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.240
The omens
aren't good here anyway.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.618
What do you mean?
What omens?

29:07.163 --> 29:09.248
Arthur's man Derfel
survived a death pit.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.002
Your death pit.

29:20.843 --> 29:22.344
He told me.

29:24.138 --> 29:25.723
He tried to show me
his scar.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.892
The Saxon cur,
I should've killed him.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.810
He holds your life
in his hands.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.729
Not if I kill him first.

29:31.729 --> 29:33.731
Gundleus!

29:33.731 --> 29:35.900
You know what the Gods say.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.153
If you approach him,
or even look at him,

29:39.153 --> 29:40.821
he could kill you
in a glance.

29:46.327 --> 29:49.747
I remember...

29:49.747 --> 29:51.707
when your mother died,
I was there.

29:52.875 --> 29:55.920
Your father cried as he took
that ring from her finger.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.963
Even though
he abandoned her...

29:59.507 --> 30:01.091
he did care for her.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.843
Very much.

30:02.843 --> 30:04.136
But he never married her.

30:05.596 --> 30:07.139
It doesn't matter.

30:09.892 --> 30:10.935
You're the man of the church

30:10.935 --> 30:12.978
and you're saying
it doesn't matter?

30:12.978 --> 30:15.439
Kings have mistresses.
It's the way of things.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.650
I'm so tired of hearing
those words.

30:20.569 --> 30:25.032
A man should be able to marry
the person that he wants,

30:25.032 --> 30:26.825
whether he a king
or a beggar,

30:26.825 --> 30:28.410
she a queen or a slave.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.539
What's troubling you,
Arthur?

30:34.917 --> 30:36.168
Will you talk to me?

30:41.382 --> 30:43.217
I think we should halt
the wedding.

30:45.719 --> 30:47.179
Ceinwyn is too young.

30:48.389 --> 30:50.099
She is a sweet girl, but...

30:51.225 --> 30:52.851
I don't love her.

30:52.851 --> 30:55.312
Well...

30:55.312 --> 30:57.022
this isn't about love.

30:59.316 --> 31:02.278
This is about the alliance,
which was your idea.

31:03.988 --> 31:06.156
I was arrogant and naive

31:06.156 --> 31:07.908
to think I could bring
the countries together.

31:07.908 --> 31:10.828
You were inspired!

31:10.828 --> 31:14.081
Powys holds sway
over Siluria and Elmet,

31:14.081 --> 31:15.708
you over Kernow and Gwent.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.627
Ceinwyn wants a man
who gives himself to her.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.923
Body and soul.

31:22.923 --> 31:25.009
Has she said that to you?

31:25.009 --> 31:28.762
I can see it in her eyes...

31:28.762 --> 31:30.556
the way she looks at me.

31:30.556 --> 31:33.726
You will treat her with
respect and kindness,

31:33.726 --> 31:35.769
which is more than she could
ever have hoped for.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.146
It is not enough.

31:38.314 --> 31:40.524
For her,

31:40.524 --> 31:41.942
or for me.

31:45.029 --> 31:46.530
With Powys by your side,

31:46.530 --> 31:48.324
you can harry the Saxons
from this land!

31:51.660 --> 31:53.662
You can prove
your doubters wrong.

31:57.124 --> 31:59.335
Stand proud
as Arthur Ap Neb...

32:01.295 --> 32:03.589
and achieve more
than your father ever did.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.717
I can defeat the Saxons
without this wedding.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.469
Gorfydd wants peace, too.

32:10.804 --> 32:14.558
He wants this alliance
because he loves Britain.

32:14.558 --> 32:16.310
Perhaps.

32:16.310 --> 32:20.397
But no man likes his daughter
to be humiliated.

32:20.397 --> 32:23.192
Don't do this, Arthur.
I beg of you.

32:31.659 --> 32:35.371
We offer this dance as
tribute to Belisima.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.584
And may her rays
shine clear tomorrow,

32:40.584 --> 32:44.004
and light up
Arthur and Ceinwyn

32:44.004 --> 32:46.757
as they exchange
their lovers rings!

32:48.467 --> 32:51.136
Choose your partner.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.429
Lady Guinevere.

33:07.695 --> 33:10.322
My king's displeased.

33:10.322 --> 33:12.366
Why?

33:12.366 --> 33:14.702
Because of Ceinwyn.

33:14.702 --> 33:17.454
She's growing a backbone,

33:17.454 --> 33:19.039
at the wrong moment,

33:19.039 --> 33:21.041
talking back at me,

33:21.041 --> 33:22.960
challenging me.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.169
Is this your doing?

33:26.088 --> 33:27.756
She's just happy.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.970
None of this nonsense
about you staying.

33:32.970 --> 33:34.763
You will go with her
to Caer Cadarn.

33:36.140 --> 33:37.725
I don't want to leave you.

33:40.144 --> 33:41.770
You'll be more use there.

33:44.231 --> 33:47.192
We'll find a way for you
to get news to me discreetly.

33:50.237 --> 33:52.740
And get close
to the Edling King.

33:52.740 --> 33:54.867
I'm not good with babies.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.118
Learn.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.496
Princess Ceinwyn, Arthur.

33:59.496 --> 34:00.664
Aren't you going to dance?

34:00.664 --> 34:02.708
I'm really not
a very good dancer.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.710
Doesn't matter.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.378
I'll guide you.

34:08.172 --> 34:10.215
Take wine with me, Bishop.

34:15.095 --> 34:17.222
Lady Guinevere,
would you like to dance?

34:18.307 --> 34:19.308
<i>Oui?</i>

34:56.178 --> 34:57.805
Princes Ceinwyn.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.473
Would you like to dance?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.694
You're a beautiful
dancer, Princess Ceinwyn.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.489
Come, dance with me.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.582
You said you were
no dancer.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.670
You seemed to be
enjoying yourself very much.

36:22.431 --> 36:23.724
Where are you going?

36:25.309 --> 36:26.935
I need some fresh air.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.980
Has she upset you?

36:29.980 --> 36:32.316
Arthur doesn't know
how to dance.

36:32.316 --> 36:34.443
I asked Guinevere
to show him.

36:42.326 --> 36:44.411
What did she say to you?

36:44.411 --> 36:45.913
She knows.

36:47.497 --> 36:49.082
I'll go after her.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.126
Let me deal with this.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.235
Once Arthur and I
are married...

37:18.612 --> 37:20.948
and only once...

37:20.948 --> 37:23.075
I will share him with you.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.621
On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and
Fridays, he shall lay with me.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.373
- Ceinwyn, I--
- Please.

37:29.373 --> 37:32.876
Please, will
you just listen to me?

37:32.876 --> 37:37.255
On
Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays,

37:37.255 --> 37:38.674
you can have him.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.759
You see?

37:43.178 --> 37:45.263
I've worked it all out.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.267
And you agree, don't you?

37:57.150 --> 37:58.777
It will
never happen again.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.612
Don't lie.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.281
Whatever you do,
don't lie to me!

38:06.243 --> 38:07.953
Be Arthur's mistress.

38:10.163 --> 38:11.540
Please.

38:13.917 --> 38:15.669
Please.

38:15.669 --> 38:18.839
Be true to me.

38:18.839 --> 38:20.841
I can't be his mistress.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.384
I don't understand.

38:23.719 --> 38:27.305
I will never be
anyone's mistress.

38:27.305 --> 38:30.350
And nor should you ever
accept this compromise,

38:30.350 --> 38:33.520
this half existence.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.689
Second place, Ceinwyn...

38:37.024 --> 38:38.734
is a living death.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.488
The full moon
will shine soon enough.

38:46.700 --> 38:48.201
For Arthur and I?

38:50.037 --> 38:51.371
For you.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.391
Ceinwyn didn't
come back to the dance?

39:11.391 --> 39:12.517
I don't believe so.

39:12.517 --> 39:13.769
Mm.

39:15.395 --> 39:18.065
Preparing herself.
Tomorrow is a big day.

39:19.232 --> 39:20.108
Mm.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.503
Arthur.

39:39.503 --> 39:40.712
May I speak with you?

39:42.589 --> 39:45.217
Derfel, you'll
guard me tonight.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.566
Where are we going?

40:03.693 --> 40:06.154
Merlin's always told me
the Gods have a plan for us.

40:07.531 --> 40:08.824
I've never believed him.
Have you?

40:10.784 --> 40:12.077
Don't know.

40:13.286 --> 40:18.959
This Guinevere...

40:18.959 --> 40:22.045
It's as if...

40:22.045 --> 40:22.963
we fit.

40:26.883 --> 40:28.760
Don't let anybody past you.

41:00.542 --> 41:01.501
You're right.

41:02.669 --> 41:03.879
She knows.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.799
Then we can't go
through with this wedding.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.301
I told her she must.

41:11.553 --> 41:12.971
I love you.

41:15.432 --> 41:16.933
You love me, don't you?

41:16.933 --> 41:18.685
- Even if I did, I--
- Do you?

41:20.187 --> 41:21.354
It doesn't matter.

41:21.354 --> 41:23.481
It matters to me.

41:26.026 --> 41:29.029
So, what? I go to Caer Cadarn,
become your mistress?

41:30.447 --> 41:31.948
I never asked you
to be that.

41:31.948 --> 41:33.867
That's the inevitable result.

41:36.203 --> 41:38.663
Do your duty
and marry Ceinwyn.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.751
Good.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.002
Now you're mine, boy.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.921
No, you are mine!

42:45.438 --> 42:46.648
Enough!

42:51.528 --> 42:54.531
You tried to kill Derfel once,
when he was just a child.

42:54.531 --> 42:56.950
You've tried again,
and you've failed.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.412
You choose a Saxon over me?

43:02.455 --> 43:03.748
You'll regret this.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.836
The both of you will
regret this.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.200
May I come in?

43:55.842 --> 43:57.302
When I proposed this marriage,

43:57.302 --> 43:59.763
I didn't think of the person
at the center of it,

43:59.763 --> 44:01.222
of you.

44:02.932 --> 44:04.976
I thought only of the peace.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.813
You deserve the full heart
of a man.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.108
You are beautiful,
you are sweet.

44:12.108 --> 44:14.652
You seem to think of me
as a pretty little princess...

44:15.945 --> 44:18.948
- a plaything.
- No.

44:18.948 --> 44:20.617
You may have been
a better looking prospect

44:20.617 --> 44:21.951
than I'd envisioned,

44:21.951 --> 44:24.871
but you haven't
broken my heart, Arthur.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.335
I'll tell your father

44:30.335 --> 44:32.003
that I cannot go through
with this marriage.

44:34.214 --> 44:35.340
Don't.

44:37.801 --> 44:41.179
You'll not leave Powys
alive if you do.

44:42.722 --> 44:45.016
Surely...

44:45.016 --> 44:46.810
he wouldn't
want you to be unhappy.

44:46.810 --> 44:49.145
My mother tried to
leave him.

44:49.145 --> 44:50.355
Once.

44:53.149 --> 44:54.692
She died soon after.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.905
An illness
took her suddenly.

45:01.241 --> 45:04.994
But I've always believed...

45:04.994 --> 45:06.121
he killed her.

45:08.915 --> 45:10.041
Leave.

45:11.584 --> 45:13.586
- As quickly as you can.
- I won't run away.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.757
It is my duty to explain.

45:17.757 --> 45:19.759
He may not kill you,

45:19.759 --> 45:21.386
but he will kill Guinevere.

45:23.138 --> 45:25.557
He's beginning to work out
what's happening.

45:25.557 --> 45:28.393
My father's
clever and cunning.

45:30.019 --> 45:31.563
I'm not doing this
for you.

45:32.772 --> 45:34.983
I'm doing it for Guinevere.

45:38.111 --> 45:39.654
What will you say to him?

45:42.365 --> 45:43.658
Doesn't matter.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.584
Go.

45:53.793 --> 45:55.753
And take her with you.

46:11.311 --> 46:12.645
He can't have murdered
his wife.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.105
He's talked about her
so lovingly,

46:14.105 --> 46:16.065
and he's been civil
and welcoming to us.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.734
I believe the princess.

46:17.734 --> 46:19.903
We do not have time to argue.

46:19.903 --> 46:22.739
What is this woman
Guinevere to you?

46:22.739 --> 46:24.616
What's happening?
Rushed from my chamber

46:24.616 --> 46:26.409
in the middle of the night.

46:26.409 --> 46:27.535
You'd better have
a good reason.

46:28.912 --> 46:30.788
Your life is in danger.

46:30.788 --> 46:33.333
I will explain, but not now.
We have to go.

47:01.361 --> 47:03.154
We'll let the horses
rest here!

47:04.239 --> 47:05.490
Arthur.

47:09.369 --> 47:11.287
I'm not coming with you
any further.

47:11.287 --> 47:12.914
What do you mean?

47:14.541 --> 47:15.875
I've been thinking it through.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.128
I'm going to Ratae.

47:19.128 --> 47:21.464
Abbot Ninian will welcome me at
the monastery.

47:21.464 --> 47:22.924
From there, I can...

47:23.925 --> 47:26.177
try and salvage some kind
of peace deal with Gorfydd.

47:28.805 --> 47:30.181
You could do that
from Caer Cadarn.

47:32.058 --> 47:34.519
I need some time
away from Dumnonia.

47:36.062 --> 47:39.274
Pelleas.
You'll travel with the bishop.

47:42.151 --> 47:44.362
May the Lord forgive you both
for what you've done.

47:44.362 --> 47:45.863
Come on.

47:47.949 --> 47:49.200
I should go too.

47:50.577 --> 47:51.995
You insist
that I come with you

47:51.995 --> 47:54.163
and now everyone
assumes the worst.

47:54.163 --> 47:56.541
What have we actually
done except kiss in a stable?

47:58.418 --> 48:00.920
I could've managed Gorfydd.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.880
Not according to Ceinwyn.

48:04.424 --> 48:06.759
She's making a
mountain out of nothing.

48:07.760 --> 48:09.596
Queen Eachern was a friend
of my mother's.

48:09.596 --> 48:10.513
She'll take me in.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.556
Marry me.

48:13.433 --> 48:14.684
What?

48:14.684 --> 48:17.520
Marry me.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.063
You're right.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.940
Gorfydd won't forgive you,
and as my wife,

48:20.940 --> 48:23.026
you will have my protection.

48:23.026 --> 48:25.028
I don't need
your protection, Arthur.

48:25.028 --> 48:27.405
You will not be
my mistress.

48:29.324 --> 48:31.034
Although, to give me
some credit,

48:31.034 --> 48:33.161
I never asked you to be.

48:34.787 --> 48:37.040
We have no alternative
except to part,

48:37.040 --> 48:38.541
and I won't lose you.

48:38.541 --> 48:40.335
I've only just found you.
Marry me.

48:42.837 --> 48:46.549
I have no dowry, no lands.

48:46.549 --> 48:47.759
I have nothing to give.

48:47.759 --> 48:49.594
You have yourself.

48:51.638 --> 48:53.556
I won't be the reason why
the peace of Britain falters.

48:53.556 --> 48:55.308
I will mend the peace.

48:57.143 --> 48:59.437
I've fended
for myself for years.

48:59.437 --> 49:01.439
I'm not sure
I'll be a good wife.

49:02.732 --> 49:04.609
I don't want a good wife.

49:04.609 --> 49:05.818
I want you.

49:07.487 --> 49:08.696
Say yes.

49:14.243 --> 49:15.578
By the stars, Guinevere--

49:15.578 --> 49:16.788
Yes.

49:17.997 --> 49:19.540
Then yes.

49:23.878 --> 49:27.507
Marry us! Here, now.

49:27.507 --> 49:30.093
Arthur, if Gorfydd has
chosen to follow us,

49:30.093 --> 49:31.511
he won't be more
than an hour behind.

49:31.511 --> 49:33.596
So, we must hurry then.

49:33.596 --> 49:35.598
But a Christian service.

49:35.598 --> 49:37.100
You must enter Dumnonia
as my wife.

49:37.100 --> 49:39.268
Everyone will have
to accept you then.

49:39.268 --> 49:41.104
And the Christians believe
in the power

49:41.104 --> 49:43.356
and the sanctity of marriage,
don't they, Sansum?

49:43.356 --> 49:47.819
"I have found the one
whom my soul loves," my Lord.

49:49.737 --> 49:51.614
But I cannot marry you.

49:51.614 --> 49:54.450
I'm not a Bishop.

49:54.450 --> 49:56.452
I don't have a church,
my Lord.

49:56.452 --> 49:57.912
Well, we can fix that.

49:59.414 --> 50:01.499
When we get to Dumnonia,
I will give you one.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.509
My Lord, my Lady,
let God be praised.

50:17.140 --> 50:18.641
Where are you going?

50:18.641 --> 50:20.393
Siluria.

50:20.393 --> 50:23.187
Ladwys is to be my wife.
Remember?

50:23.187 --> 50:27.191
Oh, so we will have
a marriage after all.

50:35.992 --> 50:37.994
You didn't permit us to
exchange our lovers' rings

50:37.994 --> 50:39.996
at Caer Dolforwyn.

50:39.996 --> 50:42.707
Were you with Gundleus
when he took Avalon?

50:44.083 --> 50:45.084
I was.

50:45.084 --> 50:46.586
So, you enjoy killing?

50:49.797 --> 50:51.048
Oh, I do.

50:52.425 --> 50:55.386
Will you be as obedient
a war dog as him?

50:55.386 --> 50:57.388
I am no one's dog.

51:01.601 --> 51:03.811
Arthur has run away
with Guinevere.

51:06.522 --> 51:08.691
You will remain here.

51:08.691 --> 51:10.568
There's work to be done.

51:37.470 --> 51:39.180
My Lord.

51:41.641 --> 51:44.727
Now from your sins
you are free,

51:44.727 --> 51:48.439
and in good conscience,
my Lady,

51:48.439 --> 51:52.985
received together into
the family of the Holy Church.

51:56.823 --> 51:58.115
Amen.

52:00.326 --> 52:02.411
I bear witness
to this union.

52:02.411 --> 52:03.579
And I bear witness.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.790
I bear witness
to this union.
