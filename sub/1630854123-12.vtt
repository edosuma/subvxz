11:12.420 --> 11:14.220
Okay.

- Botulism is a unique
pathogen, lives in soil,

11:17.510 --> 11:19.530
anaerobic,
meaning that oxygen kills it.

11:19.730 --> 11:21.620
Most germs want a living host,

11:21.820 --> 11:24.140
but botulism needs the infected
to die and decay in the soil

11:24.340 --> 11:26.490

hence the toxin.

11:26.690 --> 11:28.450

has been weaponized.
