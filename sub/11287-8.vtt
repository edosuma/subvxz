WEBVTT

00:02.366 --> 00:03.566
[laughs]
So, listen,
the defender asked me

00:03.633 --> 00:05.233
"Are you sure that you know
what you're doing?"

00:05.300 --> 00:07.400
And I said, "You should've asked
yourself the same question

00:07.466 --> 00:08.833
"when you wrote,
'This is a stick‐up'

00:08.900 --> 00:10.366
on the back of your paster."

00:10.433 --> 00:12.633
‐ Paster..
‐ You're crazy! Ow!

00:12.700 --> 00:13.966
What is LOOFA?

00:14.033 --> 00:15.466
Well, isn't it that
children's organization

00:15.533 --> 00:16.500
that you're involved with?

00:16.566 --> 00:20.133
Yes,
Leaders Of Our Future America.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.000
One week in a month,
I shape the minds

00:22.066 --> 00:23.733
of impressionable youngsters.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.233
I guess that's not
long enough to do any

00:25.300 --> 00:28.033
permanent damage to them.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.266
I have been chosen unsung hero
of the year.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.500
This is a joke, right?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.266
Not at all.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.500
Last month we were discussing
our female heroes

00:36.566 --> 00:39.100
and your name came up
right between Maya Angelou

00:39.166 --> 00:41.900
and the pink Power Ranger.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.700
I'm not a hero.

00:44.766 --> 00:47.633
Say what you will,
Henrietta Humble.

00:47.700 --> 00:51.300
But I have proof of your heroism
right here in black and white.

00:52.866 --> 00:56.433
"July 9th, 1980, Gus McGinty,
44 Trenton

00:56.500 --> 01:00.700
was pooled from his flaming car
by an unknown hero."

01:00.766 --> 01:03.440
Synclaire, I didn't
save that man's life.

01:03.506 --> 01:04.873
‐ What?
‐ Remember?

01:04.940 --> 01:07.140
That was the summer you teased
me about being too scared

01:07.206 --> 01:10.273
to knock on a door to sell
those Girl Scout Cookies.

01:10.340 --> 01:15.040
Oh, yeah! The whole troop called
you, "Khadijah‐can't‐feed‐ya."

01:16.973 --> 01:18.973
When I saw that article
I figured I'd tell you

01:19.040 --> 01:22.273
I was the unknown hero.
To shut you up.

01:22.340 --> 01:23.873
You lied to me?

01:25.306 --> 01:27.473
Well, you know, one little lie.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.540
Well, what else
have you lied about?

01:30.606 --> 01:32.740
Do you really know
the colonel's secret recipe?

01:34.640 --> 01:36.506

To sum things up, Ms. Richards

02:10.880 --> 02:13.380
we're recommending holdings
in blue chip and biotech.

02:13.446 --> 02:14.613
We've made the same
recommendations

02:14.680 --> 02:16.646
to many of your show business
colleagues.

02:16.713 --> 02:18.913
And I'm confident that
these sectors will yield

02:18.979 --> 02:20.613
at least a 20% return.

02:20.680 --> 02:22.546
Splendid.

02:22.613 --> 02:26.246
But confidence cannot buy
a first class ticket to France.

02:26.313 --> 02:30.380
And in large doses can be
fatally boring.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.880
You said the same thing
to Harry Belafonte

02:34.946 --> 02:36.013
in office affairs.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.280
She did.

02:37.346 --> 02:41.413
Do I feel the refreshing breeze
of a fan?

02:43.780 --> 02:47.313
Well, not a fan
so much as a connoisseur

02:47.380 --> 02:48.646
of great performance.

02:48.713 --> 02:50.313
[laughs]

02:50.380 --> 02:52.446
I've always liked you.

02:52.513 --> 02:53.913
What's your name?

02:55.213 --> 02:57.580
Kyle, Kyle Barker.

02:57.646 --> 03:00.046
Um, if we could get back
to the subject..

03:00.113 --> 03:02.953
Darling, we never left it.

03:04.386 --> 03:07.153
Kyle Barker.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.220
What do you recommend?

03:12.820 --> 03:14.520
That Lawrence is correct.

03:14.586 --> 03:16.586
Investing in blue chip
and biotech funds

03:16.653 --> 03:19.220
would provide relatively
risk‐free capital gains.

03:19.286 --> 03:23.320
Not to mention some hefty
dividends that are 85% tax free.

03:23.386 --> 03:24.720
Wow!

03:24.786 --> 03:29.820
I have 12 million Swiss Francs
collecting dust in Geneva.

03:29.886 --> 03:32.553
I'd like to do something
with it.

03:32.620 --> 03:33.820
How does that sound?

03:33.886 --> 03:36.786
That sounds like
10 million American dollars.

03:36.853 --> 03:38.920
I like that sound.

03:41.253 --> 03:42.886
Splendid. Well, it's settled.

03:42.953 --> 03:44.353
But please excuse me.

03:44.420 --> 03:48.820
I'm late for my eucalyptus
beauty flogging with Natasha.

03:48.886 --> 03:51.220
And I love my beauty flogging.

03:51.286 --> 03:53.720
[purring]

03:53.786 --> 03:55.986
I'll show you to the other room.

04:02.626 --> 04:04.926
I couldn't call off
the award ceremony.

04:04.993 --> 04:07.426
Those LOOFA kids love you.

04:07.493 --> 04:10.993
One of them
named his parakeet Khadijah.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.760
I'm up against a wall here.

04:12.826 --> 04:16.093
A wall you built with
your bricks of deception.

04:18.093 --> 04:19.860
Well, what am I supposed to do?

04:19.926 --> 04:21.959
Ah, just take the story
that fooled Synclaire

04:22.026 --> 04:23.826
make it a little more
believable.

04:23.893 --> 04:25.726
Fool the kids.

04:25.793 --> 04:27.526
Fool the kids?

04:27.593 --> 04:29.493
Whoa, the devil's puttin'
in some overtime

04:29.560 --> 04:31.026
up in here, ain't he?

04:32.693 --> 04:34.426
At least take a look
at this videotape

04:34.493 --> 04:35.826
the children made for you.

04:35.893 --> 04:39.059
It took them two weeks
to put this together.

04:39.126 --> 04:42.893
(children on TV)
'Khadijah James,
you're our hero.'

04:42.960 --> 04:46.393
'We love you. Yay.'

04:48.126 --> 04:49.893
It took them two weeks
to make that?

04:51.593 --> 04:53.760
Well, when you're seven
and hopped up on Pixy Stix

04:53.826 --> 04:56.160
it takes you a little while
to get focused.

04:56.226 --> 04:58.126
Now, Khadijah, what do you say?

04:58.193 --> 04:59.626
Alright.

04:59.693 --> 05:01.833
If it'll keep them off that
sugar, I'll do it.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.633
[knock on door]

05:03.700 --> 05:05.566
Evening people.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.400
Would anyone like to know
what time it is

05:07.466 --> 05:10.666
on my new Rolex Presidential?

05:10.733 --> 05:12.533
Whoo!

05:12.600 --> 05:15.533
Okay, shorty, what time is it?

05:18.266 --> 05:21.033
Who cares, man?
It's a Rolex Presidential.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.233
Let me see.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.733
Damn, and it's real too.

05:26.800 --> 05:29.566
This is a congratulatory
gift to myself.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.700
I just landed a multi‐million
dollar account today

05:32.766 --> 05:35.133
by convincing
Ms. Jacqueline Richards

05:35.200 --> 05:36.400
to invest with our firm.

05:36.466 --> 05:39.133
‐ Oh‐ho, get out of here.
‐ Jacqueline Richards.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.300
Um, who‐who is
Jacqueline Richards?

05:43.366 --> 05:46.700
Oh, my God, I mean,
uh, she's‐she's a legend.

05:46.766 --> 05:49.500
The Broadway singer, dancer,
actress.

05:51.066 --> 05:53.433
She hosted the Tony Awards
last year

05:53.500 --> 05:55.633
in an Yves Saint Laurent
original.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.366
Overton,
she was on the Love Boat.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.340
Remember she was falling
for that con man

06:02.406 --> 06:04.440
and Isaac gave her advice
on the Promenade Deck?

06:04.506 --> 06:08.006
Oh, that‐that's the one
with Sherman Hemsley

06:08.073 --> 06:09.940
and his tour de force
performance as Slick.

06:10.006 --> 06:11.840
‐ Now you know.
‐ Why didn't you just say so?

06:15.040 --> 06:19.040
Anyway, I'm delivering some
papers to her house tonight.

06:19.106 --> 06:21.106
Delivering papers.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.906
[laughs]

06:24.973 --> 06:28.273
Is that what the kids
are calling it nowadays?

06:28.340 --> 06:31.473
Oh, yeah, I read that
Ms. Jacqueline likes her men

06:31.540 --> 06:33.406
young and tender.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.840
Of which Kyle is neither.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.840
Look, just because the lady
invited me to her house

06:41.906 --> 06:44.506
does not mean
that she wants my body.

06:44.573 --> 06:47.106
Despite the obvious incentives.

06:48.906 --> 06:50.773
Oh, no, be careful, shorty.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.973
'Cause older women can be
masters of manipulation.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.740
Ms. Essner up in 4B asked me up
there to fix her toilet.

06:58.806 --> 07:01.446
When I got up there, she wanted
me to jiggle little more than

07:01.513 --> 07:03.546
just that handle, I tell ya.

07:05.313 --> 07:07.246
[doorbell rings]

07:12.780 --> 07:14.580
Good evening, I'm Carl Barker.

07:14.646 --> 07:16.113
Well, you must
be the stock broker

07:16.180 --> 07:18.846

I'm Danny,
Jacqueline's right hand.

momentarily.

Ah‐ah‐ah

08:19.486 --> 08:21.053
Well..

08:23.153 --> 08:27.453
I thought for a moment
Mel Torme had stopped by.

08:27.520 --> 08:31.520
Ms. Richards, uh, I'm‐I'm sorry,
I just couldn't resist.

08:31.586 --> 08:36.553
No need to apologize.
Well, what do you think?

08:36.620 --> 08:38.586
I mean, this is incredible.

08:38.653 --> 08:42.885
Look, there's Betty Davis
and Pearl Bailey, Frank Sinatra.

08:42.953 --> 08:46.620
Oh, the affairs this
apartment has seen.

08:46.686 --> 08:48.820
Now, who's the young guy
in the matador suit?

08:48.886 --> 08:51.686
Oh, the affairs this apartment
has seen.

08:53.420 --> 08:55.653
That's my most recent friend.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.820
He is no friend of ours.

08:59.086 --> 09:01.893
What would you say to
a glass of champagne?

09:01.960 --> 09:04.526
Oh, I'm sorry, I never drink
while I do business.

09:04.593 --> 09:08.193
And I never do business
without a drink.

09:08.260 --> 09:10.526
Are we at an impasse?

09:12.660 --> 09:13.960
[chuckles]

09:20.860 --> 09:24.960
You know, um, I was inspired
to take piano lessons

after I heard Joe Sample
accompany you on

09:26.726 --> 09:28.293
"Someone To Watch Over Me."

09:28.360 --> 09:33.760
Well, let's see if the piano

12:57.580 --> 12:58.646
(Kyle)
'No, it's..'

12:58.713 --> 13:00.620
Doing a few favors
for Jacqueline.

13:00.686 --> 13:01.986
It's a small price to pay

13:02.053 --> 13:04.253
for a multi‐million dollar
account.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.286
Don't you think?

13:05.353 --> 13:07.486
People, people, people, people.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.353
I have an important announcement
to make.

13:09.420 --> 13:12.186
We like it
when our people work hard.

13:12.253 --> 13:15.553
We like it more
when they make gobs of money.

13:15.620 --> 13:19.220
Congratulations, Kyle. You're
the funds manager of the month.

13:21.386 --> 13:22.486
Thank you.

13:22.553 --> 13:24.920
Okay, kids,
let's go and make more gobs.

13:27.553 --> 13:32.053
Oh, Kyle, your first funds
manager of the month award.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.653
After only two years.

13:33.720 --> 13:34.653
It's funny.

13:34.720 --> 13:36.820
I got mine the second month
I was here.

13:36.886 --> 13:39.820
Yes, Lawrence, they had such
high hopes for you back then.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.286
Oh‐ho!

13:42.453 --> 13:44.286
Guess who?

13:44.353 --> 13:46.453
Jacqueline, this is a surprise.

13:46.520 --> 13:49.486
Ah, Ms. Richards,
I rented your film.

13:49.553 --> 13:50.920
"Queen Of The Kalahari."

13:50.986 --> 13:53.853
I thought you gave the
performance of a lifetime.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.520
That piece of celluloid trash
was the bane of my existence.

13:58.586 --> 14:00.053
Don't dawdle, Kyle

14:00.120 --> 14:02.826
we have reservations at
The Four Seasons for lunch.

14:02.893 --> 14:04.860
Oh, I'm sorry,
I couldn't possibly go.

14:04.926 --> 14:07.193
[knock on door]
Ah, Maxine,
this is Ms. Jacqueline.

14:07.260 --> 14:09.226
Ms. Richards, Maxine Shaw.

14:09.293 --> 14:10.993
I have seen
"Queen Of The Kalahari"

14:11.060 --> 14:13.560
28 times.
It is my favorite movie.

14:13.626 --> 14:17.326
Thank you. It was mine too.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.693
What a vivacious young lady!

14:20.760 --> 14:22.560
‐ Are you a member of the firm?
‐ Well‐‐

14:22.626 --> 14:26.126
No, actually, Maxine is my lunch
date for this afternoon.

14:26.193 --> 14:28.126
That's why I have to pass
on The Four Seasons.

14:28.193 --> 14:29.926
[chuckles]
Wait, wait.

14:29.993 --> 14:33.093
You're passin' up
a four star lunch with an icon

14:33.160 --> 14:34.593
for a hot dog
on a bench with me?

14:34.660 --> 14:35.626
‐ Yes, I am.
‐ Oh, no, no, no.

14:35.693 --> 14:37.093
Oh, no, no, you go. You must go.

14:37.160 --> 14:41.360
[laughing]
This young lady gets more
impressive by the moment.

14:41.426 --> 14:43.360
Marry her, Kyle.

14:50.693 --> 14:52.960
‐ Buon appetito. |
‐ Yeah, bye‐bye, yeah.

14:54.493 --> 14:55.793
Four Seasons, huh?

14:55.860 --> 14:57.060
[laughs]

14:57.126 --> 15:01.566
Oh, charming ashtray.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.900
(Khadijah)
And then there were flames
everywhere.

15:14.966 --> 15:17.566
So I had to like pull my shirt
over my face

15:17.633 --> 15:19.100
just to breathe
through the smoke.

15:19.166 --> 15:21.066
If your shirt
was over your face

15:21.133 --> 15:22.866
couldn't people see your bra?

15:22.933 --> 15:24.566
[laughs]

15:26.866 --> 15:30.866
Anyway, the windows were rolled
up and the doors were locked.

15:30.933 --> 15:34.066
So I had to climb on top
of the flaming vehicle

15:34.133 --> 15:35.933
and pry open the sunroof.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.133
How'd you pry open the sunroof
without a crowbar?

15:40.400 --> 15:42.066
The end, thank you.

15:44.433 --> 15:47.266
What happened to our hero,
Ms. Synclaire?

15:47.333 --> 15:49.466
Doesn't she wanna
talk to us anymore?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.433
I don't know, Jim.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.633
I just don't know.

15:55.633 --> 15:58.800
There just aren't
any heroes anymore.

15:58.866 --> 16:00.940
First, we lost Darryl Strawberry

16:01.006 --> 16:03.006
then MaCaulay Culkin.

16:04.306 --> 16:06.206
Then Darryl Strawberry again.

16:07.706 --> 16:09.640
‐ Now this.
‐ I know, girl, I know.

16:11.273 --> 16:13.606
Well, wait a minute now,
I want you to give me a chance.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.806
I wasn't finished.

16:16.306 --> 16:20.073
The flames danced
across the black top

16:20.140 --> 16:23.273
like the devil's own
chorus line.

16:23.340 --> 16:26.906
From within the car
I heard a faint cry for help.

16:26.973 --> 16:32.273
"Little girl on the Kick 'n' Go

16:32.340 --> 16:34.606
you're my only chance."

16:34.673 --> 16:36.706
So with no thought for my own
safety

16:36.773 --> 16:40.906
I reached in and I grabbed
Mr. McGinty from the inferno.

16:40.973 --> 16:45.306
But didn't the fire
burn your hands?

16:45.373 --> 16:47.806
Right through to the bone.

16:47.873 --> 16:51.273
But through the miracle
of bionics, these are brand new!

16:51.340 --> 16:53.506
[all cheering]

16:53.573 --> 16:55.473
Yo, for bionic hands,
they could have done

16:55.540 --> 16:58.273
a better job on them nails.

16:58.340 --> 17:01.013
And now, Ms. Khadijah,
our special surprise guest.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.146
Surprise guest?

17:02.213 --> 17:05.313
The man who owes his life to you
Mr. Gus McGinty.

17:08.980 --> 17:11.746
Now, this is a beautiful moment.

17:11.813 --> 17:16.012
I think I see tears of joy
in Khadijah's eyes.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.079
Yeah, and now she's gonna have
to pull her own ass

17:18.146 --> 17:19.445
out that fire.

17:22.512 --> 17:24.880
I don't‐I don't know,
I don't know.

17:24.945 --> 17:26.113
[laughs nervously]

17:26.180 --> 17:29.246
Hi, Mr. McGinty,
it's nice to see you a‐again.

17:31.946 --> 17:34.246
Nah, I've never
seen you before in my life.

17:36.413 --> 17:39.446
Well, obviously Mr. McGinty is
still a little

17:39.513 --> 17:40.913
traumatized from that incident

17:40.980 --> 17:43.380
that happened
all those years ago.

17:43.446 --> 17:46.080
Now, work with me, man.

17:46.146 --> 17:47.613
Don't you remember
what I said to you

17:47.680 --> 17:50.046
just before I pulled you
from the flames?

17:54.080 --> 17:55.846
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.286
It was you! God bless you.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.486
[all cheering]

18:06.820 --> 18:08.753
[doorbell rings]

18:13.620 --> 18:15.586
Oh, Kyle.

18:15.653 --> 18:18.053
You look almost as swell
as I will.

18:19.653 --> 18:22.453
Uh, excuse me,
but I assumed an art auction

18:22.520 --> 18:25.053
at Sotheby's would be
a tad more formal.

18:25.120 --> 18:27.453
Oh, your instincts
serve you well.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.253
Actually, the auction will not
start for another two hours.

18:31.320 --> 18:35.320
And I need someone to walk my
poodles, Miles and Dizzy.

18:37.820 --> 18:39.286
Is that what I think it is?

18:39.353 --> 18:41.853
It's a shovel of sorts.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.520
Oh, by the way, Miles
was neutered on Thursday

18:45.586 --> 18:48.253
and he's a bit snippy.

18:50.553 --> 18:52.853
With all due respect, Jacqueline

18:52.920 --> 18:55.386
for the past week
I have escorted you

18:55.453 --> 18:56.986
to various functions

18:57.053 --> 19:01.193
silently inhaling
your secondhand smoke.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.926
I have even blocked your bower

19:02.993 --> 19:07.560
and now you want me to scoop
the poop of a neutered poodle?

19:09.893 --> 19:11.693
This must end.

19:11.760 --> 19:16.393
Well, the night has taken
an ugly turn.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.593
Jacqueline, there are some
things that I am willing to do

19:19.660 --> 19:21.326
for a $10 million account.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.660
And as I'm discovering
right now..

19:23.726 --> 19:26.393
...some things that I am not.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.726
I thought we were friends.

19:27.793 --> 19:30.560
No, I don't think you know
what it is to be a friend.

19:30.626 --> 19:31.893
Nobody has spoken
to me like that

19:31.960 --> 19:35.026
since Cosby refused
to snake my kitchen sink.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.660
Uh..

19:38.726 --> 19:40.593
If I ever asked you
to do something

19:40.660 --> 19:43.260
you thought was beneath you,
I apologize.

19:44.826 --> 19:46.326
Apology accepted.

19:46.393 --> 19:49.426
And if it seemed that at times
I have been manipulative

19:49.493 --> 19:51.793
well, it's because
through the years

19:51.860 --> 19:54.126
I have found people have been
more loyal to my money

19:54.193 --> 19:55.560
than they were to me.

19:57.126 --> 20:00.166
Jacqueline, that's not
the way I work.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.566
Look, I really wouldn't mind
doing some things for you

20:02.633 --> 20:06.166
but out of friendship,
not because you're wealthy.

20:06.233 --> 20:07.900
I'm speechless.

20:09.766 --> 20:12.566
There's only one thing to do.

20:12.633 --> 20:15.333
If we're going to be friends

20:15.400 --> 20:19.033
I am divesting my money
from your firm.

20:19.100 --> 20:22.500
Uh, let us discuss
the parameters of our friendship

20:22.566 --> 20:24.533
shall we?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.833
If you take your money
from my firm

20:26.900 --> 20:30.800
I will be in big trouble.

20:30.866 --> 20:32.466
Now, is that friendly?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.566
Alright, Kyle.

20:37.133 --> 20:41.866
I'll keep the account open
for you.

20:41.933 --> 20:43.500
[whispers]
Thank you.

20:44.933 --> 20:47.366
‐ Question.
‐ Huh?

20:47.433 --> 20:52.500
Would a friend join a friend
in walking her dogs?

20:53.800 --> 20:55.866
<i>Certainement.</i>

20:55.933 --> 20:59.140
But I am not scooping.

21:02.073 --> 21:04.073
A friend would.

21:04.140 --> 21:06.973
Yeah, well, did Mr. Cosby?

21:07.040 --> 21:08.906
Tempestt Bledsoe did.

21:11.173 --> 21:12.906
Well, let's call her.

21:17.373 --> 21:19.040
[Kyle laughing]

21:19.106 --> 21:21.206
<i>(Regine)</i>
<i>Don't go away,</i>
<i>we'll be right back.</i>

21:24.840 --> 21:27.640
So, I'm sorry I led you to
believe I saved your life.

21:27.706 --> 21:30.740
When I saw those worshipping
eyes staring at me

21:30.806 --> 21:32.873
there's no way I could've
let those kids down.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.573
It takes a big person
to admit they lied.

21:35.640 --> 21:37.640
Ah, we all make mistakes.

21:37.706 --> 21:40.006
I shouldn't have been
shaving and driving.

21:41.740 --> 21:43.173
Well, I tell you what,
first thing tomorrow

21:43.240 --> 21:45.440
I'm gonna call each of those
kids and set things straight.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.106
Good for you.

21:48.173 --> 21:51.006
Eh, could you leave
the shaving thing out of it?

21:54.606 --> 21:57.373
You okay? Are you..
Oh, my goodness!

21:57.440 --> 21:59.946
[grunts]

22:01.780 --> 22:04.446
My God, you saved my life!

22:05.546 --> 22:08.213
Synclaire, I saved his life.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.213
Yes, Khadijah. You did.

22:11.280 --> 22:13.180
No, no, for real. For real.

22:13.246 --> 22:14.246
Tell her, Mr. McGinty.

22:14.313 --> 22:15.780
She did.

22:15.846 --> 22:18.080
Sure, sure.

22:18.146 --> 22:20.946
No, for real, I did.
I'll show you.

22:21.013 --> 22:22.346
Swallow this.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.446
<i>(Regine)</i>
<i>Woo‐hoo!</i>

22:25.513 --> 22:26.746
<i>[Regine chuckles]</i>
