WEBVTT

00:03.733 --> 00:05.367
- HEY.

00:05.367 --> 00:08.000
I'M OUTSIDE WAITING IN THE CAR
FOR 20 MINUTES.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.833
- COMING!

00:09.833 --> 00:11.833
- [groans] YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO YOUR HAIR.

00:11.833 --> 00:15.767
I MARRIED YOU ALREADY.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.367
I'LL BE DOWN IN A MINUTE.

00:17.367 --> 00:18.800
- YEAH.
YEAH, YOUR MINUTE,

00:18.800 --> 00:20.400
IT'S A HALF AN HOUR.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.033
THAT'S WHY THE KIDS
CAN'T TELL TIME.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.700
- I SAID
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

00:25.700 --> 00:27.400
- WE CAN TELL TIME.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.967
- I KNOW.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

00:28.967 --> 00:31.600
HEY, COME ON,
WE'RE GONNA MISS THE PREVIEWS!

00:31.600 --> 00:33.633
- YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT STUPID.

00:33.633 --> 00:35.133
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

00:35.133 --> 00:37.600
COME ON. YOU KNOW I NEED
MY SEAT BY THE AISLE.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.067
- IT'S 7:23.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.067
- DON'T TELL ME.
TELL YOUR MOTHER!

00:41.067 --> 00:45.600
HELLO! THERE ARE
ONLY SO MANY AISLE SEATS.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.733
- REMIND HER
YOU HAVE A SMALL BLADDER.

00:47.733 --> 00:49.600
- MA, PLEASE.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.700
- HEY, QUIT YELLING.
I CAN'T HEAR.

00:51.700 --> 00:54.500
GO BACK TO THE CAR.

00:54.500 --> 00:59.167
- I'M GONNA WAIT
IN THE CAR.

00:59.167 --> 01:03.000
I HAVE A SMALL BLADDER,
YOU KNOW.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.100
- THAT'S TRUE.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.267
YOU REMEMBER
HIS LITTLE LEAGUE GAME?

01:20.533 --> 01:22.833
- HEY.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.600
- WHAT'D YOU DO
THAT FOR?

01:24.600 --> 01:27.633
- BECAUSE YOU'RE
MY HUSBAND,

01:27.633 --> 01:32.600
AND THAT IS THE FLATTEST THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

01:32.600 --> 01:35.033
- HMM. YEAH.

01:35.033 --> 01:38.633
- ARE YOU STILL MAD BECAUSE
WE MISSED A COUPLE OF PREVIEWS?

01:38.633 --> 01:40.667
- YEAH, AND WE HAD
NO TIME FOR POPCORN,

01:40.667 --> 01:43.667
I HAD TO SIT IN THE MIDDLE,
I GOT UP TO THE BATHROOM,

01:43.667 --> 01:45.167
EVERYBODY'S LIKE,
"THIS GUY AGAIN?"

01:45.167 --> 01:47.167
YEAH, OKAY,
GREAT NIGHT.

01:49.133 --> 01:51.267
- RAY, I'M VERY SORRY

01:51.267 --> 01:55.267
THAT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE
IN THE THEATER.

01:57.833 --> 02:01.000
- EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GO OUT,
YOU MAKE ME WAIT.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.033
- WHAT?
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:03.033 --> 02:04.500
- EVERY SINGLE TIME.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.433
YOU KNOW
HOW I HATE BEING LATE.

02:06.433 --> 02:08.033
IT MAKES ME VERY ANXIOUS.

02:08.033 --> 02:11.233
I GET ALL UHH-EGH INSIDE.

02:11.233 --> 02:12.733
- WELL, RAY, IF I'M LATE,

02:12.733 --> 02:14.733
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
THE GOVERNMENT REQUIRES

02:14.733 --> 02:17.100
THAT ONE OF US
TENDS TO THE CHILDREN.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.700
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.133
THE CHILDREN ARE NOWHERE
NEAR YOU WHEN YOU'RE UP HERE...

02:29.800 --> 02:32.767
- YOU ARE ONE UGLY WOMAN.

02:34.633 --> 02:36.300
- BLAMING THE CHILDREN.

02:36.300 --> 02:38.700
YOU WERE DOING THIS TO ME
BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.267
YOU'D MAKE ME WAIT
IN YOUR APARTMENT

02:40.267 --> 02:41.633
WHILE YOU WERE GETTING READY,

02:41.633 --> 02:44.433
AND I HAD TO SIT THERE
AND LOOK AT YOUR BOOKS.

02:44.433 --> 02:47.200
- YOU USED TO THINK
I WAS WORTH WAITING FOR.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.633
- YOU WERE WORTH WAITING FOR,

02:48.633 --> 02:53.133
BUT AFTER 15 YEARS,
YOU SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW.

02:56.533 --> 02:59.267
- WHAT CAN I SAY, RAY?
I CAN'T HELP IT.

02:59.267 --> 03:01.667
- YOU CAN HELP IT.
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.767
IT'S ALL ABOUT CONTROL.
YOU WANT THE CONTROL.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.900
THAT'S RIGHT--
I LISTEN TO TALK RADIO.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.333
- I'M CONTROLLING?

03:09.333 --> 03:11.567
WHAT ABOUT YOU
YELLING UP THE STAIRS,

03:11.567 --> 03:15.800
"HURRY UP! LET'S GO!
SMALL BLADDER!"

03:15.800 --> 03:18.233
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANYBODY
GO ANY FASTER.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.633
- OH, YOU SEE?
YOU DO DO IT ON PURPOSE.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.533
- NO, I'M NOT
DOING IT ON PURPOSE,

03:22.533 --> 03:24.867
BUT YOU MAKE ME ANXIOUS
WHEN YOU YELL.

03:24.867 --> 03:28.667
AND THEN I GET
ALL "UHH," TOO.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.067
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
MY FATHER HAD A SYSTEM--A.I.S.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.833
WHEN WE WERE KIDS

03:33.833 --> 03:35.067
AND WE WOULD GO ON A CAR TRIP,

03:35.067 --> 03:36.567
HE WOULD SET A TIME--

03:36.567 --> 03:40.233
"WE'RE LEAVING 9:00!
A.I.S.!"

03:40.233 --> 03:41.567
- "A.I.S."?

03:41.567 --> 03:44.067
- "ASS IN SEAT."

03:46.767 --> 03:48.200
IF ANYONE'S ASS

03:48.200 --> 03:51.033
WAS NOT IN THEIR SEAT
AT THE DESIGNATED TIME,

03:51.033 --> 03:54.167
THAT ASS WAS LEFT BEHIND.

03:56.033 --> 03:57.533
- SO IN THE FALL,

03:57.533 --> 04:01.233
DID YOU HAVE TO SET
YOUR ASS BACK AN HOUR?

04:03.133 --> 04:05.700
- HA-HA. YEAH.

04:05.700 --> 04:09.267
YEAH, GO AHEAD. LAUGH.

04:09.267 --> 04:10.900
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT ME.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.433
- WHAT?

04:12.433 --> 04:14.433
- WHEN I'M WAITING IN THE CAR

04:14.433 --> 04:16.067
AND YOU'RE UP HERE
LA-DI-DA-ING,

04:16.067 --> 04:20.133
IT'S PERFECTLY CLEAR THAT...
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.767
- OH...OKAY, RAY,

04:21.767 --> 04:23.800
I'M SORRY THAT IT FEELS
THAT WAY TO YOU,

04:23.800 --> 04:26.167
BUT I PROMISE YOU THAT IS NOT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

04:26.167 --> 04:27.300
- YEAH, YEAH.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.567
- NO, REALLY.
I MEAN IT.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.533
WHAT TIME ARE
THE ESPY AWARDS TOMORROW?

04:32.533 --> 04:34.067
- OH, NO, THAT'S RIGHT--
THE ESPY AWARDS.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.800
YOU'RE GONNA
DO IT AGAIN, AREN'T YOU?

04:35.800 --> 04:38.467
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME LATE FOR
MY FAVORITE NIGHT OF THE YEAR.

04:38.467 --> 04:40.567
- I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE
FOR IT EITHER.

04:40.567 --> 04:42.033
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS NIGHT OUT

04:42.033 --> 04:43.233
ALL YEAR LONG TOO.

04:43.233 --> 04:44.900
I EVEN BOUGHT
A GREAT NEW DRESS.

04:44.900 --> 04:49.667
- OH! A NEW DRESS!
PLEASE!

04:49.667 --> 04:52.367
LET ME JUST SAVE US TIME
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

04:52.367 --> 04:55.033
THE SHOES GO PERFECT,
AND IT MAKES YOU LOOK SKINNY.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.200
OKAY, SO PLEASE,

04:57.200 --> 04:59.367
COULD YOU JUST
PUT IT ALL ON NOW

04:59.367 --> 05:01.633
AND GO SLEEP
IN THE CAR?

05:05.567 --> 05:08.733
- WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT
TO LEAVE TOMORROW NIGHT?

05:08.733 --> 05:10.167
- WELL...

05:10.167 --> 05:12.767
I WANT TO GET THERE
FOR THE APPETIZERS--

05:12.767 --> 05:14.333
- OH, GOD.
- WHAT?

05:14.333 --> 05:17.867
LAST YEAR WE MISSED
THE BACON-WRAPPED SHRIMP.

05:17.867 --> 05:22.567
SO WE SHOULD LEAVE HERE
NO LATER THAN...6:30.

05:22.567 --> 05:24.467
- 6:30.

05:24.467 --> 05:29.167
- YEAH?
- 6:30, A.I.S.

05:30.767 --> 05:34.033
AND YOU WON'T BE YELLING
UP THE STAIRS.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.133
- I WON'T HAVE TO.

05:38.267 --> 05:42.133
6:30.
- 6:30.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.567
- I'M A VERY
GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.167
[sighs]

06:10.300 --> 06:13.733
- OH, RAY,
YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME!

06:13.733 --> 06:16.400
ROBERT, DOESN'T RAY
LOOK HANDSOME?

06:16.400 --> 06:20.233
- YEAH, I'LL TAKE A TABLE
FOR TWO NEAR THE BACK.

06:26.167 --> 06:30.033
- SORRY, WE DON'T SERVE
CIRCUS PEOPLE.

06:36.933 --> 06:39.000
WHAT--WHAT TIME YOU GOT?

06:39.000 --> 06:40.833
- 6:25.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.600
- YOU DON'T GOT 6:26?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.567
- I WILL IN A MINUTE.

06:51.067 --> 06:52.333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

06:52.333 --> 06:54.033
- NOTHING. NOTHING.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.700
DEBRA AND I HAD A DEAL THAT
SHE'D BE IN THE CAR AT 6:30,

06:55.700 --> 06:57.367
AND I PROMISED NOT
TO YELL UP THE STAIRS,

06:57.367 --> 06:59.633
"WE GOT TO GO.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.433
MY NEXT WIFE
ISN'T GONNA DO THIS."

07:01.433 --> 07:04.600
THINGS OF THAT NATURE, YOU KNOW?
YEAH.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.367
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M GONNA
WAIT IN THE CAR.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.600
WHEN DEBRA COMES DOWN,

07:12.600 --> 07:14.667
TELL HER THAT I AM PATIENTLY
WAITING IN THE CAR

07:14.667 --> 07:17.533
AND NOT YELLING THINGS
UP THE STAIRS!

07:20.133 --> 07:23.400
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT MA SEES IN HIM.

07:29.067 --> 07:31.533
- SO.

07:31.533 --> 07:34.133
THREE MINUTES TO SPARE.
MM-HMM.

07:45.300 --> 07:48.167
- * BE, BE-BE, BE, BE-BE,
BE-BE-BE *

07:48.167 --> 07:51.533
* OOH, OH, OH, AH, BAH-BAH

08:00.133 --> 08:01.733
- OH, GREAT.

08:06.967 --> 08:11.133
- W-I-N-S NEWS TIME, 6:29.

08:11.133 --> 08:14.500
- THAT IS CORRECT.

08:27.533 --> 08:30.400
[groaning]

08:34.400 --> 08:37.967
- RAY, COULD I GET
A HAND HERE?

08:37.967 --> 08:41.167
[watch beeping]

08:43.033 --> 08:44.200
- [sighs]

08:44.200 --> 08:46.567
DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ME.

08:56.233 --> 08:58.333
[engine turns over]

08:58.333 --> 09:01.067
- AMY, CAN YOU HELP ME?

09:01.067 --> 09:03.067
WHERE'S RAY?
- HE'S IN THE CAR.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.567
- OKAY, JUST TELL HIM
I'M COMING.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.833
YEAH, I KNOW.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.667
- RAY!

09:10.667 --> 09:11.967
RAYMOND!

09:11.967 --> 09:13.900
- OW! OW! OW! OW!
- I'M SORRY!

09:13.900 --> 09:15.200
THIS IS REALLY STUCK!

09:15.200 --> 09:16.633
- I KNOW.
JUST...

09:27.800 --> 09:32.100
- HE'S GONE.

09:41.033 --> 09:44.433
- HE LEFT?

09:56.700 --> 09:58.400
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.400
YOU DON'T JUST DRIVE OFF
AND LEAVE A PERSON.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.367
- HEY, DEBRA, WANT ME
TO DRIVE YOU OVER THERE?

10:03.367 --> 10:06.267
- YES, ROBERT WILL
DRIVE YOU OVER THERE.

10:06.267 --> 10:07.667
COME ON, DEB.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.600
DON'T LET THIS RUIN
YOUR BIG NIGHT OUT.

10:13.033 --> 10:16.567
LOOK AT YOU
ALL DRESSED UP.

10:16.567 --> 10:18.700
YOU'RE LIKE
A BEAUTY QUEEN.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.767
ISN'T SHE
LIKE A BEAUTY QUEEN?

10:20.767 --> 10:21.867
- YES, LIKE, UM...

10:21.867 --> 10:25.100
AN ANGRY
MISS NEW YORK.

10:27.733 --> 10:29.200
- AND I LOVE YOUR SHOES.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.133
- YES, MIGHTY FINE KICKS
YOU HAVE THERE, MIGHTY FINE.

10:32.133 --> 10:34.633
AND YOUR HAIR IS...

10:34.633 --> 10:39.567
NICELY ACCESSORIZED.

10:39.567 --> 10:41.400
- WHY WOULD RAY DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

10:41.400 --> 10:42.933
- I'VE BEEN SAYING IT
FOR 40 YEARS,

10:42.933 --> 10:46.000
HE'S A TERRIBLE PERSON.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.900
- OH, GOOD. GO GET THE CAR.
- I'LL GET THE CAR.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.367
- DON'T BOTHER, ROBERT.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.667
- OH, NO, DEB.
COME ON.

11:02.667 --> 11:03.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:03.833 --> 11:05.800
- YEAH, YOU CAN'T LET HIM
DO THIS TO YOU.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.933
- DON'T WORRY, ROBERT.

11:07.933 --> 11:11.000
HE WILL PAY.

11:11.933 --> 11:15.067
[cable dragging]

11:20.167 --> 11:22.300
- [laughs]

11:23.767 --> 11:25.100
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

11:25.100 --> 11:26.567
- COME. SIT, MY DEAR.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.767
I'VE GOT US
RINGSIDE SEATS.

11:34.167 --> 11:35.633
- HEY, RAY!
- RAY!

11:35.633 --> 11:37.900
- BERNIE, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

11:37.900 --> 11:39.867
- I'M ANDY'S DATE.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.200
- IT'S NOT EXCLUSIVE.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.067
WE'RE ALLOWED
TO SEE OTHER GUYS.

11:43.067 --> 11:44.567
- SO WHERE'S DEBRA?

11:44.567 --> 11:47.767
- DEBRA?
OH, UH...I LEFT WITHOUT HER.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.367
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:49.367 --> 11:52.333
- SHE WASN'T READY ON TIME,
SO I LEFT.

11:53.900 --> 11:56.900
- SO...IS SHE COMING?

11:56.900 --> 11:58.533
- PERHAPS.

11:58.533 --> 12:01.733
SHE'S A LICENSED DRIVER.
SHE'S GOT ACCESS TO A CAR.

12:01.733 --> 12:03.933
EVERYTHING SHE NEEDS TO GET HERE
WHEN SHE'S GOOD AND READY.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.433
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

12:07.433 --> 12:09.100
- I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT WOMEN,

12:09.100 --> 12:11.700
BUT ISN'T THIS
GONNA MAKE HER MAD?

12:11.700 --> 12:13.333
- IT SHOULDN'T.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.333
WE HAD A DEAL.
THE TIME WAS SET.

12:15.333 --> 12:18.733
SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT.
GOOD-BYE.

12:18.733 --> 12:20.733
BACON-WRAPPED SHRIMP.

12:22.900 --> 12:25.633
- WOW.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.900
YOU'RE MY HERO.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.167
GOOD FOR YOU, RAY.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.000
LINDA KEEPS ME WAITING
ALL THE TIME.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.433
DRIVES ME NUTS.

12:32.433 --> 12:34.400
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
THE LOOK ON HER FACE

12:34.400 --> 12:35.833
IF I DROVE OFF
WITHOUT HER.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.600
[gasping]

12:38.600 --> 12:41.733
SHE'D JUST BE STANDING THERE
ALL DRESSED UP

12:41.733 --> 12:44.100
THINKING I'M GONNA
COME BACK TO GET HER.

12:44.100 --> 12:48.100
BUT THEN I DON'T.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.500
AND EVERY SECOND THAT GOES BY,
SHE GETS MADDER AND MADDER,

12:52.500 --> 12:54.667
TURNING RED...

12:54.667 --> 12:56.967
PACING UP AND DOWN...

12:56.967 --> 12:59.533
CURSING ME OUT.

12:59.533 --> 13:02.967
OH, MAN, I COULD NEVER DO
WHAT HE DID!

13:02.967 --> 13:04.933
- [laughs]

13:04.933 --> 13:09.733
- I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, RAY.

13:09.733 --> 13:11.300
RAY?

13:13.133 --> 13:17.433
RAY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

13:17.433 --> 13:21.633
- OH, MY GOD, WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO? WHAT DID I DO?

13:21.633 --> 13:22.600
- YOU LEFT WITHOUT HER.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.900
YOU STRUCK A BLOW
FOR ALL MEN.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.700
- I LEFT WITHOUT HER.

13:27.700 --> 13:31.600
SHE WAS GETTING DRESSED UP
FOR THIS, AND I-I JUST--

13:31.600 --> 13:33.300
- YOU STRUCK A BLOW!
- SHUT UP, BERNIE!

13:33.300 --> 13:36.167
I'M A DEAD MAN!

13:36.167 --> 13:37.633
- SO DEBRA IS MAD.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.633
HEY, I GUESS I DO KNOW
A LITTLE ABOUT WOMEN.

13:44.367 --> 13:45.200
- HELLO.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.900
- HEY!
- OH, HI!

13:46.900 --> 13:48.367
- WE JUST GOT BACK
FROM THE OPERA.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.800
WE HAD A MARVELOUS TIME.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.467
- YEAH?
YOU TOO, DAD?

13:52.467 --> 13:55.300
- YEP. SLEPT LIKE A BABY.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.867
- PLACIDO WAS MAGNIFICENT.

13:59.867 --> 14:04.533
- PLACIDO SHOULD CHANGE
HIS NAME TO SNORE-IO.

14:08.167 --> 14:10.267
- RAYMOND.

14:10.267 --> 14:12.233
DON'T YOU LOOK NICE?

14:13.300 --> 14:16.300
- YES, WELCOME HOME,
RAYMOND.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.200
WE'VE ALL
BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.300
- OH, LOOK.
ARE THOSE FLOWERS FOR ME?

14:24.300 --> 14:28.467
- I THINK THEY'RE
FOR RAYMOND'S FUNERAL.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.233
- DID I MISS SOMETHING?

14:33.233 --> 14:35.300
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:35.300 --> 14:37.167
- DEBRA WAS READY
TO GO OUT TONIGHT,

14:37.167 --> 14:38.833
BUT HER CURLING IRON
GOT STUCK,

14:38.833 --> 14:40.667
AND RAY
LEFT WITHOUT HER.

14:40.667 --> 14:43.167
- HE A.I.S.-ED HER.

14:43.167 --> 14:45.733
- YOU A.I.S.-ED HER?

14:45.733 --> 14:48.000
YOU LEFT?

14:48.000 --> 14:50.367
- HER "A"
WASN'T IN THE "S."

14:56.367 --> 14:58.233
- WHY WOULD YOU
DO THAT, RAY?

14:58.233 --> 15:01.867
- YES, WHY, RAY?
WHY?

15:01.867 --> 15:04.433
TERRIBLE PERSON,
PERHAPS?

15:04.433 --> 15:06.800
- I WAS JUST TRYING
WHAT DAD USED TO DO.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.367
- OH, I NEVER DID THAT.

15:08.367 --> 15:09.900
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:09.900 --> 15:11.600
YOU DID IT TO US ALL THE TIME.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.767
- YEAH, YOU AND ROBERT,

15:12.767 --> 15:15.100
BUT I WOULD NEVER
DO THAT TO THE WIFE.

15:15.100 --> 15:18.233
THAT'S JUST SUICIDE.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.333
- YOU NEVER A.I.S.-ED MOM?

15:25.333 --> 15:27.733
- HE'S STILL HERE,
ISN'T HE?

15:40.467 --> 15:42.067
- MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GO.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.033
- [shushing]

15:44.033 --> 15:46.900
WHERE WERE WE?

15:46.900 --> 15:49.733
- OH, JUST SHUT UP, OKAY?
YOU'RE NOT PERFECT!

15:49.733 --> 15:52.633
- NEVER SAID I WAS, BUT I'LL
TELL YOU WHAT I DO SAY,

15:52.633 --> 15:55.467
I AM MORE THAN HAPPY
TO WAIT FOR MY WIFE.

15:55.467 --> 15:58.067
AND I'M SURE THAT AMY
WILL ATTEST TO THE FACT

15:58.067 --> 16:00.100
THAT I HAVE WAITED FOR HER
PLENTY OF TIMES

16:00.100 --> 16:03.567
WITH NARY A PEEP.

16:03.567 --> 16:06.033
- WHEN HAVE I
EVER MADE YOU WAIT?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.033
- WELL, NO, NO--YOU KNOW.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.567
WE ALWAYS GET TO WHEREVER
WE'RE GOING ON TIME,

16:10.567 --> 16:12.567
BUT WHEN IT'S TIME
FOR US TO LEAVE,

16:12.567 --> 16:15.567
YOU ALWAYS LIKE TO TALK
TO EVERYBODY ONE LAST TIME,

16:15.567 --> 16:18.333
BECAUSE YOU'RE
SO SWEET AND SOCIABLE.

16:18.333 --> 16:21.800
SO IT...TAKES YOU
A LITTLE LONGER TO GO.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.400
BUT--BUT IT'S CUTE, HONEY,
WHAT YOU DO.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.867
A-A-AND WHEN ANYONE ASKS ME

16:25.867 --> 16:28.467
WHY AM I JUST STANDING
AT THE DOOR DOING NOTHING,

16:28.467 --> 16:31.000
I TELL THEM,
"I'M WAITING FOR MY WIFE.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.100
SHE'S ON
HER GOOD-BYE TOUR."

16:35.900 --> 16:38.733
AND EVERYBODY LAUGHS.

16:40.700 --> 16:45.033
- "THE GOOD-BYE TOUR"?
YOU HAVE A NAME FOR IT?

16:45.033 --> 16:47.933
- A FUNNY NAME.

16:47.933 --> 16:50.067
[laughing anxiously]

16:53.633 --> 16:55.600
- MARIE DOES THE SAME THING,
ALWAYS YAPPING.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.833
- I'M TALKING
TO PEOPLE, FRANK.

16:57.833 --> 16:59.500
I'M A PEOPLE PERSON.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.767
- YEAH?

17:00.767 --> 17:03.367
WELL, THE PEOPLE
COULD USE A BREAK FROM YOU.

17:03.367 --> 17:04.667
- YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.400
SOME OF US CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE--NOT CLOCKS.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.100
- WELL, SOMETIMES YOU CARE MORE
ABOUT PEOPLE THAN YOU DO ME.

17:10.100 --> 17:12.600
- YES!
I TOO AM PEOPLE.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.533
- AND ALL YOU
CARE ABOUT IS YOU.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.933
- WHO WENT TO THE STUPID,
BORING OPERA WITH YOU?

17:16.933 --> 17:18.567
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
WE WERE LATE FOR

17:18.567 --> 17:22.200
BECAUSE IT TAKES YOU
AN HOUR TO PAINT YOUR FACE.

17:23.733 --> 17:27.133
- THAT WAS FOR PLACIDO.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.067
- A MIME TROUPE
OUTSIDE THE THEATER

17:29.067 --> 17:31.733
TRIED TO SIGN HER UP.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.467
- IF I'M SO MUCH TROUBLE,

17:37.467 --> 17:40.200
I'M NEVER GONNA GO
ANYWHERE WITH YOU AGAIN.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.667
- THIS EVENING TURNED OUT
PRETTY WELL AFTER ALL.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.600
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.267
- CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING, ROBERT?

18:00.267 --> 18:01.733
- HERE WE GO.

18:01.733 --> 18:04.333
- WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SO ANXIOUS
TO LEAVE WHEREVER WE GO?

18:04.333 --> 18:06.400
HOW COME YOU'RE NEVER
SATISFIED WITH WHERE YOU ARE?

18:06.400 --> 18:09.000
- I'M VERY SATISFIED NOW.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.867
- I WISH YOU WOULD SEE
DR. GREENBERG.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.633
- AGAIN WITH GREENBERG.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.467
- I JUST THINK
YOU COULD BE HAPPIER.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.500
- DO WE HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS HERE?

18:18.500 --> 18:21.033
- HONEY, I JUST WANT YOU TO FEEL
BETTER ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.533
- I AM FANTASTIC
ABOUT WHO I AM!

18:23.533 --> 18:25.867
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS, OKAY?

18:25.867 --> 18:27.667
JUST FORGET IT,
ALL RIGHT?

18:27.667 --> 18:31.000
GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE.
END OF TOUR.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.700
- WHY ARE YOU AFRAID
TO BE HEALTHY?

18:44.433 --> 18:47.433
- THEY'RE MESSED UP,
HUH?

18:51.333 --> 18:53.200
YEAH...

18:53.200 --> 18:55.167
IT'S FUNNY HOW EVERYBODY

18:55.167 --> 18:57.500
SORT OF HAS THE SAME STUFF
GOING ON, RIGHT?

19:01.133 --> 19:03.433
I LIKE YOUR EARRING.

19:08.633 --> 19:10.733
[laughs]

19:14.067 --> 19:17.200
ALL RIGHT...

19:17.200 --> 19:20.300
OKAY, LOOK...

19:20.300 --> 19:23.033
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LEFT,

19:23.033 --> 19:24.900
BUT WE HAD A DEAL.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.400
IT WAS 6:30.

19:26.400 --> 19:28.333
ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOUR HAIR

19:28.333 --> 19:31.233
GOT ALL SNAGGLED UP
IN YOUR CURLING POLE,

19:31.233 --> 19:33.100
AND I LEFT.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.800
I LEFT, AND--AND...

19:36.800 --> 19:38.167
THAT WAS WRONG.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.133
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:41.133 --> 19:44.100
YOU--YOU--
IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.933
YOU SAY YOU DON'T MEAN
TO BE LATE,

19:45.933 --> 19:47.767
BUT YOU ALWAYS ARE.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.633
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT WE'RE
GONNA LOOK BACK

19:49.633 --> 19:53.667
AND WE'RE GONNA SEE
THAT WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT

19:53.667 --> 19:58.167
WAS A STEP FORWARD
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

20:01.967 --> 20:04.167
AND--AND...

20:04.167 --> 20:06.967
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH
YOU WERE THE ONE

20:06.967 --> 20:08.967
WHO BROKE OUR AGREEMENT...

20:08.967 --> 20:13.633
I BROUGHT YOU THIS LOVELY
SPORTS-THEME BOUQUET.

20:15.200 --> 20:19.933
NOW, I'M GLAD THAT WE COULD JUST
PUT THIS WHOLE MATTER BEHIND US.

20:19.933 --> 20:22.800
- I'D LIKE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS MORE UPSTAIRS.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.300
- OKAY. OKAY.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.300
ARE YOU COMING?

20:36.300 --> 20:39.333
- I'LL BE UP
IN A MINUTE.

21:09.567 --> 21:12.100
[laughs]

21:46.700 --> 21:50.433
- [moaning]
