WEBVTT

00:38.958 --> 00:40.416
When I was ten,

00:40.500 --> 00:42.583
your grandfather brought me
to the aftermath

00:42.666 --> 00:44.333
of the Battle of Hildenard.

00:44.416 --> 00:49.458
He offered me a gold coin for every blade
I retrieved from the fallen.

00:49.541 --> 00:51.458
Said we needed the steel.

00:52.083 --> 00:53.583
But I knew it was a lie.

00:54.583 --> 00:57.791
He wanted me to know death.

00:58.750 --> 01:02.000
Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.541
Your brother thinks
he can talk his way out of anything.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.791
He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.

01:06.875 --> 01:10.708
But mark me, child,
if you want to last in this world,

01:10.791 --> 01:14.958
you must learn to be both the fox
and the wolf.

01:17.458 --> 01:19.125
We'll paint the walls in gold.

01:19.916 --> 01:22.041
Import crystal chandeliers.

01:22.125 --> 01:24.208
Advisors will enter here,

01:24.291 --> 01:28.208
but the regent
will have her own, secret entrance.

01:28.291 --> 01:31.041
She should have a kind, fat face.

01:31.125 --> 01:36.500
Clever, to charm her subjects,
but pliable so we can mold her.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.333
Perhaps, she could be my daughter.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.958
You'd give me a throne?

01:41.041 --> 01:46.750
I will give you the world, child,
if you prove you can take it.

01:59.916 --> 02:01.458
What should we do with her?

02:08.208 --> 02:10.000
She won't make trouble for us.

02:10.583 --> 02:14.000
Strip her of her possessions
and send her to the far colonies.

02:17.875 --> 02:20.500
-She's a symbol of the old regime.

02:20.583 --> 02:23.291
Kill her now,
and only one must die.

02:23.958 --> 02:26.166
Let her live and you may need
to kill thousands.

02:26.250 --> 02:29.041
We can show the people we are merciful.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.708
A wolf has no mercy.

03:14.708 --> 03:16.791
-Will you be okay?

03:17.625 --> 03:19.541
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.625
Jinx!

04:02.666 --> 04:03.750
It's gone.

04:03.833 --> 04:04.750
What?

04:07.791 --> 04:09.375
<i>It was all for nothing.</i>

04:58.666 --> 05:01.875


05:01.958 --> 05:07.208


05:07.291 --> 05:14.125


05:21.250 --> 05:23.416


05:23.500 --> 05:26.750


05:51.333 --> 05:52.833
Sir, we've secured the area.

05:53.333 --> 05:56.000
I've got orders to escort you
back into the city.

05:56.875 --> 05:57.875
Sir?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.333
Are you all right?

06:40.083 --> 06:43.291
Who lives here?
Another Councilor friend of yours?

06:47.750 --> 06:49.333
Caitlyn!

06:49.416 --> 06:52.833
Oh. We were so worried.
Thank goodness you're safe!

06:52.916 --> 06:54.250
And you found a stray.

06:54.833 --> 06:56.333
This is Vi.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.083
She's from the undercity.

06:58.166 --> 06:59.208
So I see.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.083
Could we have a word, Caitlyn?

07:02.833 --> 07:04.000
In private.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.250
You have to speak
to the Council.

07:11.333 --> 07:13.083
Speak to the Council?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.583
You understand you've broken several laws?

07:15.666 --> 07:17.791
She was doing what she thought was right.

07:19.666 --> 07:21.166
I'll take responsibility.

07:21.250 --> 07:23.041
You're a Councilor's daughter.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.416
Your actions reflect on the entire body.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.500
My actions?

07:27.583 --> 07:29.708
You know what else
reflects on the Council?

07:29.791 --> 07:32.791
Its citizens living on the streets.
Being poisoned.

07:32.875 --> 07:35.625
Having to choose between a kingpin
who wants to exploit them

07:35.708 --> 07:38.000
and a government that doesn't give a shit.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.333
-Caitlyn!

07:41.791 --> 07:45.250
I'm sure our daughter could use
some rest after her adventures.

07:51.791 --> 07:53.791
-I'll schedule an audience.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.458
Thank you.

07:56.541 --> 07:59.958
You and your friend
can address the Council yourselves.

08:00.041 --> 08:02.916
I'd suggest you prepare accordingly.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.583
-Her injuries are severe.
-You think I can't see that?

08:29.416 --> 08:30.250
Huh.

08:30.833 --> 08:36.000
I believe I can save her,
but the process will be demanding.

08:36.708 --> 08:39.250
-Sometimes death is a mercy.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.458
She can take it.

08:41.541 --> 08:43.625
And before I begin, I must know…

08:44.666 --> 08:46.541
Are you prepared to lose her?

08:48.291 --> 08:50.041
-Jinx?

08:50.541 --> 08:52.833
-Jinx!

08:54.125 --> 08:58.458
She won't die, Doctor.

08:58.541 --> 08:59.666
She can't.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.166
I understand.

09:07.708 --> 09:10.625
Please understand,
this is for your own sanity.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.750
I, too, once had a daughter.

09:33.708 --> 09:35.500
Silco isn't taking guests.

09:35.583 --> 09:36.708
Not a problem.

09:36.791 --> 09:40.500
Wasn't here for him.
Thought I might bend your ear.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.416
You know when I ask my mates
what Silco's up to,

09:46.500 --> 09:49.166
your name's first out of their mouths.

09:49.250 --> 09:53.250
"Sevika's out in the harbor,"
or "Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit."

09:54.083 --> 09:55.625
You're a scary lady.

09:57.875 --> 09:59.000
Get to your point.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.708
Run a tight ship, don't you?

10:01.791 --> 10:03.916
Except it's not your ship.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.708
It's his and Jinx's.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.416
This is your plan?

10:08.500 --> 10:11.708
Undermine Silco
by making a half-assed play at my ego?

10:12.583 --> 10:13.791
Gotta hand it to you, Finn.

10:13.875 --> 10:16.791
Every time I think you can't get dumber,
you dig a new low.

10:18.125 --> 10:21.416
Let's be plain, then. He's slipping.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.666
The undercity's devolving to chaos.

10:23.750 --> 10:27.250
And somehow, I get the feeling
he isn't up there balancing booksheets.

10:28.958 --> 10:32.541
Jinx gets a whim,
suddenly his spine's made of jelly.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.541
And here you are, shoveling his shit.

10:36.791 --> 10:40.041
Ego is one thing, brain's another.

10:46.041 --> 10:49.500
You aren't the only one dissatisfied
with his performance.

10:50.166 --> 10:52.958
There's bigger fish than Silco.

11:26.750 --> 11:31.000
Mel. Elora.
You didn't have to come out to meet me.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.958
-What are you doing here, Mother?
-Can I not visit?

11:34.041 --> 11:36.541
I've heard stories
of Piltover's hospitality.

11:37.875 --> 11:41.625
You didn't sail halfway across
the continent to sample the local cuisine.

11:41.708 --> 11:45.208
-It's been over a decade, Mel.
-Since you banished me?

11:45.291 --> 11:46.791
Such drama.

11:46.875 --> 11:50.708
I sent you here to oversee
our family's interests and grow yourself.

11:50.791 --> 11:51.791
Which you have.

11:51.875 --> 11:55.333
You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality
will be more at home

11:55.416 --> 11:58.166
with those soft-spined
idealists overseas."

12:00.125 --> 12:01.833
You have your father's memory.

12:01.916 --> 12:04.083
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.

12:04.166 --> 12:06.416
-Mel.
-Or that.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.750
Your brother's gone.

12:16.291 --> 12:17.375
What happened?

12:18.958 --> 12:21.958
He crossed the wrong man.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.083
I was distracted.

12:25.166 --> 12:27.500
That's a mistake I can't take back.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.916
Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye
to Hextech weaponry.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.666
I knew it.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.291
War is coming.

12:38.375 --> 12:41.375
You've let the problems
of your undercity fester too long.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.000
Piltover isn't like Noxus.

12:43.083 --> 12:46.000
War isn't our first and every recourse.

12:46.083 --> 12:50.416
I sponsored Hextech to protect the city,
not burn it to the ground.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.208
It's not conjecture, it's a fact.

12:53.291 --> 12:57.083
Weapons can't be unmade
and they are always used.

12:57.166 --> 13:00.958
I'm here to help guide you
to the right decisions.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.625
-I don't need your guidance.
-We'll see.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.666
Miss Medarda?

13:08.708 --> 13:09.708
-Yes?
-Yes?

13:13.041 --> 13:14.791
He's for me, dear.

13:18.958 --> 13:21.375
I'm off to sample the local cuisine.

13:34.041 --> 13:37.791
We'll present our case
to the Council tonight.

13:40.666 --> 13:41.833
You did all this yourself?

13:42.666 --> 13:44.208
Without even going down there?

13:46.791 --> 13:49.958
And I thought Powder could get obsessed.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.958
What happened to her, it's not your fault.

13:59.958 --> 14:01.875
When my parents were still alive…

14:03.916 --> 14:05.666
me and Powder
used to share a bed like this.

14:06.250 --> 14:09.166
Except, maybe, half the size.

14:10.208 --> 14:15.208
We played a game where we pretended
to be bigger and bigger monsters.

14:16.583 --> 14:21.125
So she would say, "I'm a slug monster
with venom for ooze."

14:22.375 --> 14:26.833
And I'd say, "Well, I'm a slug-eating crab
with razor spikes."

14:29.125 --> 14:33.750
Sometimes, I… I'd get carried away
and she'd get scared.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.416
I didn't want her to start crying
and wake my parents up, so…

14:40.041 --> 14:42.333
I pretended to chase my own monsters away.

14:43.958 --> 14:44.833
I'd say…

14:46.000 --> 14:48.500
"No monster's gonna get you
when I'm here."

14:50.166 --> 14:51.958
Then a real monster showed up.

14:54.791 --> 14:56.333
And I just ran away.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.750
I left her.

15:27.541 --> 15:30.500
You know, Powder,
you're stronger than you think.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.083
Vi?

15:33.750 --> 15:35.791
<i>I'm so sorry, Powder.</i>

15:35.875 --> 15:38.291
-<i>Your sister is jinx.</i>
-No!

15:39.791 --> 15:41.125
<i>Jinx.</i>

15:41.208 --> 15:43.041
No, no. No!

15:44.833 --> 15:47.250
I understand this must be painful.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.166
No!

15:49.250 --> 15:52.416
-I'm afraid it will only get worse.
-Wait!

15:53.083 --> 15:56.833
No!

16:29.541 --> 16:31.041
What have you done?

16:32.375 --> 16:33.791
I saved her life.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.791
Hey, watch it, furball.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.416
Move.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.666
Oh.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.541
Hmm.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.041
-Hmm.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.791
Huh?

17:35.291 --> 17:36.541
Hmm…

17:39.041 --> 17:40.208
Like this.

17:42.166 --> 17:43.625
Get away from her.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.208
Bye…

18:06.375 --> 18:08.500
Oh, ingenious.

18:09.041 --> 18:12.250
Though these blades
seem improperly pitched.

18:12.875 --> 18:14.250
You're wrong.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.750
It's designed for the fissures.

18:17.416 --> 18:18.833
The air is denser.

18:18.916 --> 18:19.750
Oh.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.125
-Are you all right, lad?

18:22.208 --> 18:25.583
Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle.

18:26.916 --> 18:29.291
Are you Councilor Heimerdinger?

18:30.250 --> 18:32.875
It's just Heimerdinger now.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.208
What are you doing
on this side of the river?

18:36.166 --> 18:38.166
I wanted to offer my assistance

18:38.250 --> 18:40.458
to the citizens of the undercity, but…

18:40.958 --> 18:43.958
it seems I'm unwelcome.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.083
-What is it?
-We're having the exact same day.

18:51.041 --> 18:55.291
That looks like more than a sprain.
You need medical attention.

18:55.375 --> 18:58.583
I have to get home.
It isn't safe for me here.

18:59.583 --> 19:03.208
I don't know how I'm gonna get there
with my leg busted, and, well…

19:03.791 --> 19:05.083
you're holding my ride.

19:18.291 --> 19:21.458
Do they teach military history
at your Academy, Mr. Talis?

19:22.125 --> 19:24.500
It's, um, Councilor Talis.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.791
And I'm not sure.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.333
The Alornian General
Sonnem Parlec

19:29.416 --> 19:32.333
used to find ways
to meet his enemies blindfolded.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.666
He said a man's mind
hides behind his body.

19:35.750 --> 19:38.666
Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.541
You're Mel's mom.

19:41.291 --> 19:42.625
Among other things.

19:43.500 --> 19:46.375
Squeeze, child.
You won't break it.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.666
I do have other matters,
so if you'll excuse me…

19:49.750 --> 19:51.916
The threat
of the undercity is real.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.250
-Your leadership is impotent.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.583
We may not be Noxus, but Piltover
isn't as helpless as you think.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.500
Who said anything about Piltover?

20:00.583 --> 20:04.666
The Council is the problem.
The mind hiding behind the body.

20:04.750 --> 20:09.000
Navigating your current crisis
requires expertise you lack.

20:09.666 --> 20:13.083
Do you know what the success rate
for senior Academy inventors is?

20:13.166 --> 20:14.250
Three percent.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.708
We're no strangers to failure.

20:16.791 --> 20:20.416
What makes this the City of Progress is
that we keep trying until we get it right.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.875
So thank you for your advice,
Mrs. Medarda, but I have a city to run.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.208
Wait.

20:32.250 --> 20:35.291
I see why this province
and my daughter have fallen for you.

20:35.916 --> 20:37.833
You have the passion of youth.

20:38.333 --> 20:41.000
I have experience.

20:41.083 --> 20:44.958
I want you to succeed here, Jayce,
to grace the world with Hextech.

20:45.041 --> 20:49.833
But if you don't accept certain realities,
I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.

20:49.916 --> 20:53.750
Slaughtered with your eyes closed.

20:56.708 --> 20:58.458
Three of my suppliers have said

20:58.541 --> 21:00.958
they intend to delay shipments until fall

21:01.041 --> 21:03.208
to give things "time to cool off."

21:03.291 --> 21:05.708
We have greater concerns
than a dip in profits.

21:05.791 --> 21:08.666
The Sheriff betrayed us.
We need better information.

21:08.750 --> 21:12.250
We need to act.
Before anyone else gets killed.

21:12.875 --> 21:15.375
Perhaps Marcus
was operating independently.

21:15.458 --> 21:18.791
What could anyone in the undercity
offer him that he didn't have up here?

21:18.875 --> 21:20.500
It's not what they offered him,

21:21.083 --> 21:22.875
it's what he had to lose.

21:24.750 --> 21:28.166
Councilors, my daughter
has a unique insight into our situation.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.666
Thank you.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.791
Councilors, this is Vi.
She was born in the undercity.

21:35.291 --> 21:38.291
Even though we failed her
in countless ways,

21:38.375 --> 21:42.291
she risked everything to show me
what life is really like down there.

21:42.875 --> 21:46.625
People are starving, sick,
ravaged by Shimmer.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.916
They live in constant fear

21:49.000 --> 21:51.750
of the coordinated efforts
of violent crime lords.

21:52.291 --> 21:54.041
One man leads these efforts.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.208
Silco.

21:55.958 --> 21:58.458
We've done investigations of Silco.

21:58.541 --> 22:01.166
They yielded no such level
of organization.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.291
And who led these investigations?

22:05.208 --> 22:06.791
What does this Silco even want from us?

22:06.875 --> 22:09.625
He believes the undercity
should be independent.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.791
He calls it the Nation of Zaun.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.708
What about these?
Do you know who made them?

22:16.791 --> 22:18.416
No, well…

22:19.000 --> 22:21.166
-Uh…
-Her name is Jinx.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.291
This Jinx has the Gemstone?

22:24.791 --> 22:27.333
-Then we have to go in by force.
-That could trigger war.

22:27.416 --> 22:30.708
-There are good people down there.
-Hmph. Bad ones too.

22:30.791 --> 22:33.750
Even if we wanted to invade,
they have Shimmer.

22:34.333 --> 22:35.750
We have Hextech.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.625
What happened to you?

22:37.708 --> 22:40.375
We've been talking about talking
for weeks now.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.666
They're still cleaning the blood
off the bridge.

22:42.750 --> 22:45.750
-When do we say enough is enough?
-Jayce, you don't know war.

22:46.333 --> 22:47.208
I do.

22:47.291 --> 22:52.083
It must be our last resort.
There may be a diplomatic solution.

22:53.750 --> 22:54.791
She's right.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.625
What? You want to negotiate with him?

23:04.708 --> 23:07.666
It may be the only way
to avoid further bloodshed.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.958
This is insane.
Did you learn nothing?

23:11.041 --> 23:13.000
You can't talk to him!

23:13.083 --> 23:16.208
He hates you. Everything you stand for.

23:16.791 --> 23:18.833
He will never back down.

23:21.791 --> 23:25.500
-Enforcers, please escort them out.
-Forget it.

23:25.583 --> 23:27.916
I remember
where your fancy damn door is.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.875
Vi! Wait!

23:42.375 --> 23:44.875
Wait! Where are you going?

23:44.958 --> 23:47.041
I don't know. Back where I came from?

23:47.125 --> 23:49.416
Seems like that's
what everyone up here wants.

23:49.500 --> 23:51.625
-I can fix this.
-You can't!

23:51.708 --> 23:54.416
This is how things are.
How they've always been.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.000
I was so stupid to think it could change.

23:57.083 --> 24:00.958
There must be something else
we can do. Some other way.

24:01.041 --> 24:03.291
We'll make a new plan. We have to try.

24:03.916 --> 24:06.541
We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.

24:06.625 --> 24:09.833
Topside and bottom. Oil and water.
That's all there is.

24:10.625 --> 24:11.833
What about us?

24:14.375 --> 24:15.458
Oil and water.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.208
Wasn't meant to be.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.208
-You're just saying that.
-Do yourself a favor, Cupcake.

24:23.083 --> 24:26.750
Go back to that big,
shiny house of yours and just…

24:27.958 --> 24:30.500
forget me, okay?

25:32.458 --> 25:35.708
Viktor, I've been working
on a private project

25:35.791 --> 25:38.125
for a couple weeks now.

25:38.208 --> 25:39.833
No.

25:54.250 --> 25:58.333
Viktor, I've been working on this
for a year now and…

26:00.708 --> 26:01.666
Viktor.

26:13.916 --> 26:17.833
Viktor, I was hoping you might take a look
at something I've been working on.

26:23.166 --> 26:24.250
Viktor…

26:24.333 --> 26:27.791
I was inspired by your…

26:28.291 --> 26:30.208
Everything you do inspires me.

26:38.750 --> 26:39.666
Viktor!

27:01.000 --> 27:02.625
Viktor!

27:26.958 --> 27:29.750
Sky? Sky? No.

27:29.833 --> 27:33.333
No! That… that can't… that can't…

28:16.625 --> 28:19.083
You want to make Silco pay
for what he's done?

28:20.583 --> 28:22.000
I could have you arrested.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.750
You guys really like
to bandy that threat around.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.333
You ever been to Stillwater?

28:27.416 --> 28:29.041
-No.

28:29.125 --> 28:32.375
So you just wave an arm,
have someone dragged off,

28:32.458 --> 28:34.750
don't bother to find out
what it does to someone

28:34.833 --> 28:39.166
being stuffed in a stone box
for weeks, or months, or even years?

28:41.458 --> 28:45.458
-Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.
-I want in.

28:46.083 --> 28:47.166
There is no in.

28:47.250 --> 28:49.916
-You heard the Council.
-Fuck the Council.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.625
You said you were tired of doing nothing.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.916
That's the only sensible thing
that came out of anyone's mouth tonight.

28:55.500 --> 28:56.791
I'm not a vigilante.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.333
No, you're a victim.

29:02.291 --> 29:05.291
-Huh…

29:10.875 --> 29:13.958
This so people notice you when you
raise your hand in the boardroom?

29:14.041 --> 29:16.833
-We built them for mining the fissures.

29:16.916 --> 29:18.541
-Hmm.

29:18.625 --> 29:20.791
Someone close to me had a pair of these.

29:22.375 --> 29:26.250
You're the first person Caitlyn
looked for when we made it to topside.

29:26.333 --> 29:28.208
Of everyone up here,

29:28.291 --> 29:31.500
you're the one she trusted
to do something.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.500
What do you want me to do? Arrest him?

29:38.000 --> 29:40.375
Silco controls
the undercity with Shimmer.

29:40.458 --> 29:41.916
Shut down his supply,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.125
and it's only a matter of time
before his own people turn on him.

29:45.208 --> 29:46.375
And how do we do that?

29:46.458 --> 29:48.500
Take out
his manufacturing facilities.

29:48.583 --> 29:51.000
Hit them hard and fast,
before he can react.

29:55.791 --> 29:56.791
So…

29:57.666 --> 29:59.583
We got a deal, pretty boy?

30:35.041 --> 30:36.666
-Come on.
-Over the bridge.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.375
Secured!

30:44.500 --> 30:45.416
Get back!

30:45.500 --> 30:46.875
You little punk.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.208
Hey!

31:28.750 --> 31:30.041
-Hmm.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.083
Hmm.
