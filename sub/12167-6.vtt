WEBVTT

00:11.203 --> 00:13.353
Anything look familiar to you, Teyla?

00:13.523 --> 00:16.640
I do not believe
this is a world I have visited before.

00:16.803 --> 00:21.923
- No landmarks. How can you tell?
- It is difficult, but every world is unique.

00:22.083 --> 00:25.120
I've heard reports from SG teams
on missions like this,

00:25.283 --> 00:28.673
specifically the mission reports
of Colonel Samantha Carter.

00:28.843 --> 00:32.313
She and I worked together
to avert global catastrophe.

00:32.482 --> 00:35.475
She and I... Ay, ay, ay.

00:35.643 --> 00:38.032
- What was I saying?
- Mission reports.

00:38.203 --> 00:41.400
There's similarities
between worlds that support life.

00:41.563 --> 00:45.761
Makes sense. For example,
the colour of the sky is just a product...

00:47.643 --> 00:49.281
- What was that?
- Turbulence?

00:49.443 --> 00:52.276
Seems to be OK now.
I wonder what that was.

00:54.563 --> 00:56.554
Getting conflicted readings.

00:56.723 --> 01:00.557
It looks like a powerful energy field
about 2,000 yards over there.

01:00.723 --> 01:03.362
- Over where?
- 18 degrees from our heading.

01:03.523 --> 01:05.241
It's worth checking out?

01:05.403 --> 01:08.076
Significant energy emission
indicates technology.

01:08.243 --> 01:11.041
So you think it's worth checking out?

01:11.923 --> 01:14.915
I'm sorry. Yes. Energy field good.

01:18.763 --> 01:21.357
- Maybe not.
- It's getting worse.

01:21.523 --> 01:23.912
That's enough. I'm getting outta here.

01:24.963 --> 01:26.954
We're not gaining any altitude.

01:27.123 --> 01:29.921
Controls are unresponsive.

01:30.803 --> 01:33.078
The drive just went offline.

01:34.603 --> 01:36.082
We're going in.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

02:49.523 --> 02:52.754
- Nice landing, sir.
- Thank you.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.357
- What happened?
- You took us too close.

02:55.523 --> 02:59.311
- Whose idea was that?
- Let's not get caught in the blame game.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.043
OK, can you fix the ship or not?

03:03.243 --> 03:06.280
- None of my equipment's working.
- The sun is still high.

03:06.443 --> 03:10.402
- What does that mean?
- We can make it back before dark.

03:10.563 --> 03:14.158
- We should start now.
- Zelenka and I can return and fix it.

03:14.323 --> 03:17.838
No, it's not just the jumper.
None of my equipment's working.

03:21.283 --> 03:23.797
All right. Let's gear up.

03:35.843 --> 03:38.721
Check it out, sir.
I think my compass has gone wonky.

03:38.883 --> 03:42.114
You brought a magnetic compass
to another galaxy?

03:42.283 --> 03:45.753
You have no way of knowing
if this planet's magnetic field is...

03:45.923 --> 03:48.642
Wait a second. Let me see that.

03:51.363 --> 03:55.197
The disturbance is electromagnetic,
which is why all our equipment's out.

03:55.363 --> 03:58.594
- Which direction is the gate?
- You're the one flying.

03:58.763 --> 04:01.641
All right. We should be able
to figure this out.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.722
I believe it is this way.

04:06.443 --> 04:08.434
Let's move out.

04:23.003 --> 04:26.234
- Hey, can we go that way for a bit?
- Why?

04:26.403 --> 04:29.520
The compass is acting weird.
I might be on to something.

04:29.683 --> 04:32.675
- I'm glad I brought it along.
- How prescient of you.

04:48.283 --> 04:50.274
Hello, hello.

04:52.843 --> 04:55.357
Oh, yeah. Definitely this way.

05:00.283 --> 05:03.161
- Didn't fly over this, did we?
- I don't know.

05:03.323 --> 05:05.837
I was busy trying not to get us killed.

05:06.003 --> 05:10.076
- These ruins are very old.
- Several hundred years, maybe more.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.518
So, the population here's extinct?

05:13.363 --> 05:17.072
- Check this out.
- OK, I give up.

05:17.243 --> 05:21.475
If the disturbance is man-made,
it's emanating from within these ruins...

05:21.643 --> 05:24.715
somewhere... over there.

05:25.723 --> 05:27.714
If we find it, can we shut it off?

05:27.883 --> 05:30.317
If we can, we won't
have to walk to the gate.

05:30.483 --> 05:33.520
I was thinking more of saving
a good puddle jumper.

05:33.683 --> 05:36.072
That too.

05:36.243 --> 05:40.441
All right, guys. We'll stay here
for a second, see if McKay can...

05:50.723 --> 05:53.237
- They're kids.
- With weapons pointed at us.

05:53.403 --> 05:55.792
Lower your weapon, Lieutenant.

05:56.883 --> 05:59.602
Hey... kids.

05:59.763 --> 06:02.516
We are not here
to harm you in any way.

06:02.683 --> 06:06.153
That's right. What she said.
We're friendly, OK?

06:06.323 --> 06:09.838
We arrived through the Stargate.
We were only trying to return home.

06:11.203 --> 06:14.878
- I don't think they understand.
- I believe they do.

06:15.043 --> 06:18.035
- Why are they pointing arrows at us?
- You're a full-grown.

06:18.203 --> 06:21.081
- Excuse me?
- You need to see the elders.

06:22.043 --> 06:25.797
Elders... sound good.

06:25.963 --> 06:28.557
Just lead the way.

06:33.843 --> 06:35.834
Full-growns?

07:10.443 --> 07:13.401
Look what they're wearing.
What are they holding?

07:15.643 --> 07:17.634
Major.

07:26.643 --> 07:29.601
- Now, where'd they get that?
- It looks like a shrine.

07:31.923 --> 07:35.040
- They don't worship the Wraith?
- That'd be a first.

07:35.203 --> 07:38.001
That'd be disturbing.

07:38.163 --> 07:40.154
Wraith bones.

07:41.283 --> 07:42.875
Yeah, we know.

07:43.043 --> 07:47.480
Its death bird fell out of the sky years ago.
It reminds us of how life used to be.

07:47.643 --> 07:50.555
- Used to be?
- Before.

07:50.723 --> 07:52.679
Fell out of sky.

07:52.843 --> 07:56.199
- I picked up on that.
- What knocked us down knocked it down?

07:56.363 --> 07:58.638
- If so, we need to find it.
- Why?

07:58.803 --> 08:01.875
Anything that can knock out
a Wraith dart, it's a big deal.

08:02.043 --> 08:04.637
That would be nice to have.

08:08.603 --> 08:11.197
The elders are ready.

08:44.763 --> 08:49.234
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- I'm Keras, one of the village elders.

08:49.403 --> 08:53.316
I'm Sheppard, and this is
Rodney and Teyla and...

08:53.483 --> 08:56.475
- Did you say you're one of the elders?
- Yes.

08:58.723 --> 09:00.714
How old are you?

09:01.443 --> 09:03.434
24.

09:03.603 --> 09:06.561
- And that makes you an elder?
- How did you get here?

09:06.723 --> 09:11.160
We used the Stargate to travel
from our world to visit yours.

09:11.323 --> 09:16.522
- You do know of the Stargate?
- It's a big, round... thing.

09:18.283 --> 09:22.196
No one has come through the well
for nearly... 500 years.

09:22.363 --> 09:25.673
Yeah, well, here's the thing.
We're a little lost.

09:25.843 --> 09:29.074
And you are all older than 24?

09:29.243 --> 09:31.234
Ford, how old are you?

09:31.403 --> 09:33.917
- 25, sir.
- I guess so.

09:37.803 --> 09:39.794
Is that a problem?

09:42.923 --> 09:45.312
Please... sit.

09:47.123 --> 09:50.240
They're trespassers.
We don't have to explain ourselves.

09:50.403 --> 09:52.155
I apologise.

10:10.763 --> 10:13.721
- You are familiar with the Wraith?
- Yes.

10:13.883 --> 10:17.671
Well, we're not friends
or anything like that.

10:17.843 --> 10:19.913
The Wraith used to farm our planet

10:20.083 --> 10:22.802
as we used to farm livestock
and beasts of burden.

10:22.963 --> 10:27.081
- Only, we were their herd.
- They seem to do that everywhere.

10:27.243 --> 10:31.714
Our ancestors fought them, but...
our weapons were not strong enough.

10:31.883 --> 10:35.478
Our people tried to hide from them,
but they were always found.

10:35.643 --> 10:39.158
None died peacefully.
None could enter into the eternal rest.

10:39.323 --> 10:40.995
Eternal rest?

10:41.163 --> 10:46.601
To die at the hands of the Wraith,
to breathe your last breath amongst such...

10:46.763 --> 10:49.038
hatred and evil...

10:50.643 --> 10:55.114
There's no way to move peacefully
into the next world when that is your fate.

10:55.723 --> 10:59.955
My ancestors decided that to beat
the Wraith, we must think as they think.

11:00.123 --> 11:05.243
We ensured that we would never provide
the Wraith with a crop worth picking.

11:05.403 --> 11:08.679
- By...?
- None of us passes the age of 24.

11:08.843 --> 11:11.232
How do you manage that?

11:12.203 --> 11:15.832
On the eve of our 25th year,
we make the sacrifice,

11:16.003 --> 11:21.202
both for our people and for our own
safe passage into the eternal rest.

11:21.923 --> 11:24.232
- What?
- You kill each other?

11:24.403 --> 11:27.554
No. We take our own lives.

11:31.363 --> 11:35.276
And so the Wraith have not returned
for nearly 500 years.

11:51.883 --> 11:55.922
Never in my life have I ever felt so... old.

11:56.643 --> 12:00.431
This is without a doubt the most
screwed-up way of life I can imagine.

12:00.603 --> 12:03.720
- They seem to accept it.
- They're kids. What do they know?

12:03.883 --> 12:07.592
- They don't want us around.
- Because we may bring back the Wraith.

12:07.763 --> 12:12.075
They can't be right. Would the Wraith
just ignore them 'cause they're young?

12:12.923 --> 12:15.562
I don't eat veal,
but it can't be the same thing.

12:15.723 --> 12:17.714
Of course not. Veal is delicious.

12:17.883 --> 12:22.957
The Wraith don't come by because
the electromagnetic field takes them out.

12:23.123 --> 12:26.195
Why do they not land outside
and take the village by foot?

12:26.363 --> 12:30.072
Perhaps I'm not being clear.
Nothing works here.

12:30.243 --> 12:34.395
Not their stunners, their darts. Even
their shields wouldn't function correctly.

12:34.563 --> 12:38.078
Why risk it when there's a smorgasbord
through some other Stargate?

12:38.243 --> 12:41.792
- Our guns still work, right?
- They're relatively primitive.

12:43.523 --> 12:47.482
- We must tell them.
- Not before I've looked at those ruins.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.634
They're sacrificing themselves.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.478
What are we gonna tell them, Teyla?
"Everything you believe is wrong."

12:53.643 --> 12:56.919
"Trust us, because we've been here
for almost an hour."

12:58.803 --> 13:02.193
We've talked it over.
You can stay until you've fixed your ship.

13:02.363 --> 13:04.160
But you must work quickly.

13:04.323 --> 13:07.633
Your being here
makes our people uncomfortable.

13:07.803 --> 13:11.398
Fair enough.
We'll work as quickly as we can.

13:11.563 --> 13:16.239
There may be something in the ruins
that caused us to lose control of our ship.

13:16.403 --> 13:18.792
- They should be watched at all times.
- Aries.

13:18.963 --> 13:21.761
That's fine. Totally understandable.

13:21.923 --> 13:25.359
I'll choose two of the villagers
to keep an eye on you.

13:27.483 --> 13:30.600
- Casta says you're 100 years old.
- Who's Casta?

13:30.763 --> 13:33.721
- Me.
- Where do you get your information?

13:33.883 --> 13:37.114
- Why are we going to the old city?
- I gotta check something.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.716
- What?
- Grown-up stuff.

13:38.883 --> 13:42.796
- What's a grown-up?
- Someone who's older than you are.

13:42.963 --> 13:46.638
- I'm three days older than Cleo. Tell me.
- You're not a grown-up.

13:46.803 --> 13:49.954
You just said someone
that's older than me is a grown-up.

13:50.123 --> 13:52.512
I don't need you to tell me what I just said.

13:52.683 --> 13:55.834
- OK.
- So, why are we going to the old city?

13:56.003 --> 14:00.838
- Ford, a little help here.
- You're a natural.

14:01.003 --> 14:04.962
Let's see how long we can
be quiet. Who can be quiet the longest?

14:05.123 --> 14:08.081
- I'm not a quiet person.
- That's talking.

14:08.243 --> 14:10.632
I'm not a quiet person. I talk a lot.

14:14.963 --> 14:19.514
- Do you have young?
- Me? No. Not yet, anyway. You?

14:19.683 --> 14:22.516
Oh, yes. They're raised
in one of our other villages.

14:22.683 --> 14:25.561
- Other villages?
- To keep family lines apart.

14:25.723 --> 14:27.714
Got it.

14:28.203 --> 14:30.763
How many villages are there like this?

14:30.923 --> 14:35.474
12. There are a few larger than this one,
but more are small in number.

14:35.643 --> 14:40.080
- And they all make the sacrifice?
- Yes, we all do, as have many before.

14:40.243 --> 14:42.438
No one ever...?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.477
- What?
- Decides not to go through with it?

14:46.643 --> 14:49.032
Takes off? Runs away?

14:50.243 --> 14:52.837
- There has been hesitation.
- I bet.

14:53.003 --> 14:56.882
We can be... persuasive
when the time comes.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.757
I know what that means.

15:06.843 --> 15:11.633
Look... I gotta tell you,
I don't understand this at all.

15:13.043 --> 15:16.877
Where I come from, we value life
more than almost anything else.

15:17.723 --> 15:22.239
You know what Lieutenant Ford would've
missed if his life was over a year ago?

15:22.403 --> 15:24.678
We're not all that different.

15:24.843 --> 15:30.839
It's just that... I would rather have
24 years of peace than a life of fear.

15:31.003 --> 15:33.676
Yeah, but what if there's another way,

15:33.843 --> 15:35.834
naturally, when the time comes?

15:36.003 --> 15:38.642
- The time comes.
- Of course it does.

15:38.803 --> 15:41.522
- That's part of being alive.
- I mean for me.

15:41.683 --> 15:44.481
Tomorrow's the first day of my 25th year.

15:44.643 --> 15:47.396
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

15:47.563 --> 15:51.112
That's why I lead the council of elders.
I'm oldest among the 24s.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.195
- You mean, tomorrow you, um...
- Tonight.

15:54.363 --> 15:56.672
Tonight?

15:56.843 --> 16:00.199
Our way was put in place long ago,
and it works.

16:00.363 --> 16:04.322
It's not for me to question it.
Tonight I die.

16:12.243 --> 16:15.918
- How many?
- Four, but there may be more.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.278
He's given them time to prepare the ship?

16:18.443 --> 16:22.197
- Against my strong objection, yes.
- So this is Keras.

16:22.363 --> 16:25.594
Who should be readying himself
for his sacrifice.

16:25.763 --> 16:29.199
I will be the eldest by tomorrow,
but that might be too late.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.160
What do you wanna do?

16:31.323 --> 16:34.201
They came through
the Wraith well, Pelius.

16:34.363 --> 16:38.515
If they stay, the Wraith will come back
and our sacrifices will be for nothing.

16:38.683 --> 16:42.471
- They must be forced to leave.
- I need time to talk to the villages.

16:42.643 --> 16:44.873
- We have little of it.
- You know the laws.

16:45.043 --> 16:49.594
A forced sacrifice must be
agreed upon by all the villages.

16:49.763 --> 16:51.754
Leave us!

16:56.003 --> 16:58.233
Talk with who you need to talk.

16:58.403 --> 17:03.318
I will give them to the end of this day
to leave. If they do not...

17:14.603 --> 17:17.481
Hey, hey. Coming through. Thank you.

17:17.643 --> 17:19.440
- What's that?
- A compass.

17:19.603 --> 17:22.878
- What's that?
- Used for determining direction on Earth.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.762
- Where's Earth?
- Listen, Cleo...

17:25.923 --> 17:27.435
- Casta.
- Whatever.

17:27.603 --> 17:30.754
Aren't you supposed to be observing?
Know what that means?

17:30.923 --> 17:35.678
- Observing?
- You stay out of my way and watch.

17:35.843 --> 17:37.356
- Why?
- Because.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.354
- Because why?
- I say so.

17:39.523 --> 17:40.842
Why?

17:41.003 --> 17:43.881
I can't work with you two
asking stupid questions!

17:44.043 --> 17:46.432
Now, sit down and shut up!

17:47.443 --> 17:49.638
Oh, don't. Don't.

17:50.483 --> 17:52.121
You're mean.

17:52.803 --> 17:56.352
Thank you for finally noticing.
You wanna go, huh?

17:56.523 --> 17:59.037
OK, OK, OK.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.434
You got a real gift with the kids.
You do birthday parties?

18:02.603 --> 18:06.198
I have a purpose here. You deal with them.
Excuse me. Thank you.

18:09.563 --> 18:12.760
It's OK. He's upset
'cause you're smarter than him.

18:12.923 --> 18:15.562
You guys know what chocolate is?

18:15.723 --> 18:18.157
No? This is gonna be huge. Come with me.

18:18.323 --> 18:22.316
We're gonna go over here
and we'll leave the mean old man alone.

18:50.043 --> 18:52.034
Oh, yeah.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.394
OK.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.074
Hello, hello.

19:12.283 --> 19:14.956
It's really good, huh? Want some more?

19:15.123 --> 19:16.920
<i>Major</i>.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.358
McKay? My radio's working.

19:19.523 --> 19:22.993
Which is how I'm able to speak with you,
yes. You have a second?

19:24.323 --> 19:27.520
- Tell me you found the field generator.
- <i>I found it</i>.

19:27.683 --> 19:30.993
- And obviously the off switch.
- Better than that.

19:31.163 --> 19:33.154
It's powered by a zero-point module.

19:33.323 --> 19:36.235
<i>It's possible the EM field's</i>
<i>been online for centuries</i>.

19:36.403 --> 19:40.282
Only a ZPM is capable of powering it
that long. I've shut it down.

19:40.443 --> 19:42.752
- <i>You've disabled the shield?</i>
- Temporarily.

19:42.923 --> 19:45.073
I need to get the ZPM back to Atlantis.

19:45.243 --> 19:48.952
We cannot just take it. It is their only
protection against the Wraith.

19:49.123 --> 19:51.239
<i>The Wraith haven't been here in years</i>.

19:51.403 --> 19:55.681
If this is a functioning ZPM, we bring 'em
back to Atlantis. How hard is that?

19:55.843 --> 20:01.520
Hard. But the ZPM could give us the power
to make a lot of problems go away.

20:01.683 --> 20:04.117
Exactly. I need to get it back to a lab.

20:04.283 --> 20:08.435
- How do you plan on doing that?
- You've given me a flying lesson.

20:08.603 --> 20:11.515
It's gonna take more
than a five-minute lesson.

20:11.683 --> 20:14.322
Listen, I'm not gonna
be dogfighting Wraith darts.

20:14.483 --> 20:16.997
Ford and I can handle it.

20:17.163 --> 20:21.076
All right, fine. You can go.
But get back to me before tonight.

20:21.243 --> 20:24.360
We sort of have a... a deadline.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.162
Right.

20:27.323 --> 20:30.360
I think it is dangerous
to leave the villages unprotected.

20:30.523 --> 20:32.991
The Wraith haven't been around
in a long time.

20:33.163 --> 20:35.723
This is reckless. You must see that.

20:35.883 --> 20:39.239
What are the odds they're gonna show up
in the next few hours?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.756
- Why were the guides sent back?
- Were they?

21:00.923 --> 21:04.040
- Yeah, they were.
- Must have been nap time.

21:05.683 --> 21:11.121
- You think this is a joke, Sheppard?
- I don't find much here to be that funny.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.398
- What's wrong?
- Two of the full-growns are unwatched.

21:15.563 --> 21:19.556
- It's fine, Aries.
- You should get ready for tonight, Keras.

21:19.723 --> 21:24.274
- The cleansing ceremony is set to begin...
- Fine. I'll go ready myself.

21:35.483 --> 21:39.920
- What were they talking about?
- He's sacrificing himself tonight.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.753
- Keras?
- I tried to talk him out of it.

21:42.923 --> 21:46.552
- If we tell them about the field...
- I'm working on that.

21:46.723 --> 21:51.114
But we can't do anything until
we figure out what to do with the ZPM.

21:57.603 --> 22:00.242
- This is a very bad call.
- Why?

22:00.403 --> 22:04.191
You just told me this ZPM powers
their defences against the Wraith.

22:04.363 --> 22:05.921
Yep.

22:06.083 --> 22:09.917
- You don't see the problem in stealing it?
- Not stealing, so much as...

22:10.083 --> 22:12.756
If it's of any good to us,
we can bring them here.

22:12.923 --> 22:15.915
For one, we don't even know
how many of them there are.

22:16.083 --> 22:19.155
- I hardly doubt more than a few hundred.
- What?

22:19.323 --> 22:21.314
We're barely getting by ourselves.

22:21.483 --> 22:23.713
This is a big city.
We have the mainland.

22:23.883 --> 22:28.638
We can't just visit planets, take away
their defences and bring 'em back here.

22:28.803 --> 22:33.638
- If they have a ZPM, yes, we can.
- How morally superior you must feel.

22:33.803 --> 22:39.082
They live in trees. Plus they could stop
killing themselves for no good reason.

22:39.243 --> 22:41.552
They kill themselves for no good reason?

22:41.723 --> 22:46.319
Yes. The EM shield is what's keeping
the Wraith away, not the sacrificing.

22:46.483 --> 22:51.955
OK. You said that the sacrifices began
at the same time the shield went online.

22:52.123 --> 22:53.442
More or less.

22:53.603 --> 22:57.152
If the people who built the shield
implemented the suicide pacts,

22:57.323 --> 23:01.316
perhaps the two things aren't
as disconnected as you think.

23:05.723 --> 23:07.122
Maybe.

23:09.083 --> 23:13.440
One more day, that's all I need.
I'll have a much clearer picture then.

23:13.603 --> 23:16.322
- Clearer picture of what?
- Long story.

23:16.483 --> 23:18.474
Stick around and I'll tell you.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.238
I'll be honest with you, Sheppard.

23:22.403 --> 23:26.476
There's nothing I'd like more than
to spend more time talking with you.

23:26.643 --> 23:28.634
But it's not possible.

23:31.683 --> 23:33.992
What if you're wrong?

23:34.163 --> 23:37.678
What if a day doesn't matter?
What if a year doesn't matter?

23:37.843 --> 23:40.357
And what if it does?

23:40.523 --> 23:45.074
I'd never rest peacefully knowing I was the
reason the Wraith returned to this planet.

23:45.243 --> 23:48.713
- You can live a full life.
- You're a warrior among your people.

23:48.883 --> 23:51.477
One who is trained
to defend and protect them.

23:51.643 --> 23:55.602
- I guess you can say that.
- Would you give your life if necessary?

23:57.523 --> 24:00.083
It'd have to be really necessary.

24:00.243 --> 24:03.041
How is the sacrifice so different?

24:03.203 --> 24:05.922
So this is just gonna go on for ever?

24:07.443 --> 24:11.152
As long as the Wraith don't return, yes.

24:18.763 --> 24:20.879
Would you stand witness?

24:21.043 --> 24:23.034
Me?

24:25.083 --> 24:26.880
What do I have to do?

24:27.043 --> 24:29.921
Just be there as I prepare.

24:31.043 --> 24:35.355
We gather the strength from those
close to us for the sacrifice to come.

24:41.683 --> 24:43.674
Dr Weir.

24:43.843 --> 24:49.122
The bad news is it looks like the device
harnesses M7G-<i>6</i> 77's unique EM field.

24:49.283 --> 24:52.958
- Probably wouldn't work for us.
- Assuming we considered stealing it.

24:53.123 --> 24:56.081
Not much point to that, either.
ZPM's almost depleted.

24:57.003 --> 24:59.392
- So it's worthless?
- I wouldn't say that.

24:59.563 --> 25:03.272
Enough to give us the shield
at full power for a few hours,

25:03.443 --> 25:05.559
handy if the Wraith ever attack.

25:05.723 --> 25:09.921
- It could do what it was doing...
- It is of more worth to them than us?

25:10.083 --> 25:11.994
Probably.

25:12.163 --> 25:14.472
- Definitely.
- Fine.

25:16.363 --> 25:18.433
- There's another thing.
- Uh-huh?

25:18.603 --> 25:21.401
I think I have a theory
about the suicide pact.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.078
- Yeah? What is it?
- I'm not sure how much power this had,

25:25.243 --> 25:29.759
but whoever built the device knew its field
wouldn't cover the whole planet for long.

25:29.923 --> 25:34.041
- So it was built to protect a smaller area?
- The area round the villages.

25:34.203 --> 25:36.512
But if the population got much larger,

25:36.683 --> 25:40.722
the kids may move out of the field and
become susceptible to a Wraith attack.

25:40.883 --> 25:44.319
- So the suicide pact is...
- Population control.

25:44.483 --> 25:46.758
- Wow, that's a little severe.
- A little?

25:46.923 --> 25:51.121
They believe if they die in turmoil,
they don't go to their version of heaven.

25:51.283 --> 25:57.392
While this guarantees that they die in
peace, it's a religion, and a ridiculous one.

25:57.563 --> 25:59.793
That's not a judgement
we can make for them.

25:59.963 --> 26:01.521
- No?
- No.

26:01.683 --> 26:07.440
- No.
- Return the ZPM and get the device online.

26:26.683 --> 26:29.038
<i>Sheppard, it's McKay</i>.

26:30.003 --> 26:33.279
This is Teyla.
Major Sheppard is... unavailable.

26:33.443 --> 26:37.402
- <i>What does that mean?</i>
- He's taking part in the ceremony.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.997
- That doesn't sound good.
- <i>Are you back?</i>

26:40.163 --> 26:42.358
I'm just gonna put the ZPM back.

26:42.523 --> 26:46.198
- I'll let Major Sheppard know.
- The jumper's outside the EM field.

26:46.363 --> 26:49.878
We should be able to leave
as soon as I've finished.

26:56.803 --> 26:58.794
Teyla!

27:04.643 --> 27:07.555
We've found a Wraith bracelet
that is transmitting.

27:07.723 --> 27:11.272
<i>We need that field returned</i>
<i>as soon as possible!</i>

27:13.323 --> 27:15.553
Stop him!

27:25.403 --> 27:27.917
I'm sorry. I had to do that.

27:28.843 --> 27:30.993
McKay, we need it on now!

27:31.843 --> 27:34.232
- Move!
- I'm coming!

27:46.043 --> 27:48.477
- What are you waiting for?
- That should be it.

27:48.643 --> 27:51.555
- What?
- Far be it for me to cause a panic, but...

27:51.723 --> 27:53.679
What did you do?

27:54.523 --> 27:58.072
- What did you do?
- In my haste, I may have broken it.

28:03.003 --> 28:05.153
How dare you defile our remembrance!

28:05.323 --> 28:07.234
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

28:07.403 --> 28:09.712
You broke the laws!
You must be punished!

28:09.883 --> 28:12.443
- That's not up to you!
- Neither is it up to you!

28:15.163 --> 28:19.202
You've had enough time.
You must fix your ship and go!

28:21.883 --> 28:24.875
How long do they expect us
to play chance with our lives?

28:25.683 --> 28:28.151
Every second a full-grown is in our village

28:28.323 --> 28:31.679
is a second we are no longer safe
from the Wraith.

28:31.843 --> 28:34.038
They must leave now!

28:35.123 --> 28:37.591
I'll take you to the well.
You're not safe here.

28:37.763 --> 28:40.675
- McKay and Ford are in the ruins.
- We'll pick them up.

28:40.843 --> 28:43.403
- They put the ZPM back?
- There's been a setback.

28:43.563 --> 28:46.555
- What did McKay do?
- Friends, please!

28:49.043 --> 28:53.639
The full-growns have agreed to leave
and never come back.

28:53.803 --> 28:56.033
I will take them to the well myself.

28:56.563 --> 28:59.123
All this will be over soon

28:59.283 --> 29:02.480
and we can get on with the ceremony.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.712
Make sure they get there.

29:26.283 --> 29:30.674
- Please tell me you have this working.
- These things are usually plug-and-play.

29:30.843 --> 29:35.280
- Get to the point.
- There is a sequence which I haven't got.

29:35.443 --> 29:38.674
None of that matters now.
Grab what you can and come with me.

29:38.843 --> 29:40.913
Aries will be sending men behind us.

29:41.083 --> 29:45.201
- What made the bracelet broadcast?
- I do not think it was anything we did.

29:45.363 --> 29:48.878
It may be an emergency beacon
that activated when the dart crashed.

29:49.043 --> 29:51.682
The EM field's been
keeping it quiet ever since.

29:51.843 --> 29:56.234
It must have begun transmitting
as soon as McKay turned off the field.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.076
Listen to me. We have to move on. Now!

29:59.243 --> 30:02.440
- We cannot do that.
- Keras, this is hard to explain.

30:02.603 --> 30:05.356
We can't go anywhere
till we fix this device.

30:05.523 --> 30:08.196
Abandon your ship.
You're risking your lives.

30:08.363 --> 30:12.675
This is not about our ship.
It's about the protection of your villages.

30:12.843 --> 30:14.754
What?

30:14.923 --> 30:18.393
The reason our ship went down,
the reason the Wraith dart crashed,

30:18.563 --> 30:21.077
it's because of this device.

30:21.243 --> 30:25.680
It renders all electromagnetic-based
technology inside the shield inert.

30:25.843 --> 30:27.515
I don't understand.

30:27.683 --> 30:30.561
The Wraith didn't stay away
because of your sacrifices.

30:30.723 --> 30:33.317
They stayed away because of this shield.

30:34.603 --> 30:37.117
- That can't be true.
- It's not entirely true.

30:37.283 --> 30:39.672
The shield doesn't protect
the whole planet.

30:39.843 --> 30:41.993
I believe the sacrifices were brought in

30:42.163 --> 30:44.961
so your society never left
the confines of the shield.

30:45.123 --> 30:50.197
The sacrifices play a part in your survival,
but not for the reasons you believe.

30:50.363 --> 30:53.560
- It's impossible.
- I can prove it to you.

30:53.723 --> 30:57.796
But you have to give us time
to bring this device back online.

30:58.923 --> 31:00.914
Keras is weak.

31:01.643 --> 31:04.032
I doubt his oath to the sacrifice.

31:06.723 --> 31:09.317
The full-growns have clouded
his judgement.

31:17.243 --> 31:19.279
They've stopped in the old city.

31:19.443 --> 31:23.641
Gather the bows and the spears. We will
rid ourselves of them once and for all!

31:23.803 --> 31:25.794
Yeah!

31:27.603 --> 31:29.798
Coming through. Excuse me.

31:31.763 --> 31:34.755
All right. And again.
Still in the way. Thank you.

31:38.283 --> 31:41.434
- This'll never work.
- We don't have much of a choice.

31:53.523 --> 31:56.913
- This is not the well, Keras.
- It's my fault.

31:58.323 --> 32:02.396
We just received word from McKay
that our ship's just been repaired.

32:02.563 --> 32:05.714
In fact, he's back there
right now waiting for us.

32:05.883 --> 32:08.795
We were just saying goodbye to Keras.

32:10.803 --> 32:13.601
- You think I'm a fool?
- No.

32:13.763 --> 32:16.152
I just think you're a little cranky.

32:17.283 --> 32:21.959
Look, if you wanna escort us back
to the ship, you can watch us leave.

32:26.443 --> 32:29.560
Lead the way.

32:48.803 --> 32:50.794
All right.

33:05.363 --> 33:08.196
- Oh, you scared me!
- You scared us.

33:08.363 --> 33:10.115
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

33:10.283 --> 33:12.843
We came to see if you left any chocolate.

33:13.003 --> 33:15.392
Yes, yes, of course.

33:17.603 --> 33:19.833
What?

33:20.323 --> 33:22.314
Oh, you want some.

33:24.203 --> 33:28.162
You can have this... but you gotta
promise to let me work, OK?

33:28.843 --> 33:30.834
- OK.
- All right.

33:31.003 --> 33:32.994
- Quietly.
- Come on.

33:34.803 --> 33:36.794
All right.

33:44.323 --> 33:48.680
- Do you intend to leave McKay behind?
- We'll circle till he gets the device on.

33:48.843 --> 33:50.322
He'll show up.

33:55.563 --> 33:58.282
It's too late. We're too late!

34:16.723 --> 34:19.442
- What the hell was that?
- Too small to be a dart.

34:19.603 --> 34:21.594
It's a probe of some kind.

34:21.763 --> 34:24.721
Probably came to check out
the signal from the bracelet.

34:24.882 --> 34:27.875
We gotta take it down
before it gets back to the gate.

34:34.523 --> 34:36.514
Boys...

34:39.203 --> 34:41.592
Let us take it down or we're all in trouble.

34:41.763 --> 34:45.039
Even if you were able to destroy it,
more will come.

34:45.203 --> 34:49.161
- That is not true.
- Why do you think they're here?

34:49.322 --> 34:53.873
You. The Wraith have sensed a crop worth
harvesting and they've come to claim it.

34:56.803 --> 35:00.352
Keras, tell them
that we gotta take this thing down

35:00.523 --> 35:02.912
before it gets back to the Stargate.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.956
- Where's the other full-grown?
- Aries...

35:09.043 --> 35:12.399
There's a device that shields us
from the machines of the Wraith.

35:12.563 --> 35:15.441
- The sacrifices might...
- He'll be in the old city.

35:15.603 --> 35:18.959
You've let your fear of the sacrifice
put our people in danger.

35:19.123 --> 35:23.036
You have been protected
from the Wraith by a shield.

35:23.203 --> 35:24.716
We turned it off by accident.

35:24.883 --> 35:28.319
But if we get it back up,
the Wraith will never come again.

35:28.483 --> 35:33.273
There's only one thing I have to do
to make sure they never come again.

35:33.443 --> 35:35.434
Kill you.

35:41.283 --> 35:43.274
Come on.

35:52.123 --> 35:54.318
Somebody's coming.

36:02.723 --> 36:05.078
What is this?

36:05.243 --> 36:08.519
- You must come with us now.
- Can't do that. Listen.

36:08.683 --> 36:10.674
I need to finish my work here.

36:10.843 --> 36:13.403
The Wraith don't care how old you are.

36:13.563 --> 36:18.239
I need to get this device turned on and
I am so close, so give me one more shot.

36:22.003 --> 36:24.597
Both of you, go to your rooms!

36:26.363 --> 36:28.923
You're not buying this, are you?

36:34.963 --> 36:36.954
Hey!

36:42.243 --> 36:43.562
No.

36:46.603 --> 36:48.833
Sir, I don't like where this is headed.

36:49.003 --> 36:50.994
Easy, Ford.

36:54.083 --> 36:57.120
Nobody's shooting just yet.

36:57.283 --> 37:00.832
- Yet.
- And nobody's going to, either.

37:01.003 --> 37:04.712
Aries, you have no idea
what you're up against here.

37:05.523 --> 37:08.833
Our weapons are more powerful
than any you have ever seen.

37:09.003 --> 37:12.279
She's telling the truth.
They do more than make a lot of noise.

37:12.443 --> 37:14.195
They will kill you.

37:38.763 --> 37:40.754
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:44.563 --> 37:46.554
- It works.
- Of course it works.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.918
I must tell Aries. Come with us.

37:53.243 --> 37:55.234
Hey, you guys OK?

37:55.403 --> 37:57.792
Head back to the village. You'll be fine.

38:03.763 --> 38:07.039
Your presence has brought the Wraith.

38:07.203 --> 38:09.876
All our ancestors' sacrifices
you've undone.

38:10.043 --> 38:14.002
- All because you refused to leave.
- It's not that simple.

38:14.163 --> 38:16.836
Yeah, it is that simple.

38:20.043 --> 38:22.273
- Aries, no.
- Keras!

38:25.123 --> 38:27.762
- Sir?
- Hold your fire!

38:29.283 --> 38:32.241
Look what you've done.

38:32.403 --> 38:34.792
He's as guilty as you are.

38:36.083 --> 38:39.393
- Ford.
- Ready, sir.

38:39.563 --> 38:41.952
We will defend ourselves.

38:42.123 --> 38:45.035
And, believe me, you don't want that.

38:47.243 --> 38:49.438
Archers, ready!

38:54.403 --> 38:56.758
It works! Aries!

38:57.523 --> 39:00.720
It works! The device works.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.602
The device they speak of is real.
I've seen it.

39:07.803 --> 39:09.122
What?

39:09.283 --> 39:12.514
McKay fixed it and the Wraith bird
fell right out of the sky.

39:12.683 --> 39:16.562
- That doesn't matter...
- Aries, it works.

39:23.043 --> 39:25.034
You all right, McKay?

39:26.363 --> 39:28.923
Trying to catch my breath.

39:34.163 --> 39:38.520
Get the medical kit from the jumper.
You're gonna be OK.

39:54.563 --> 39:59.239
I was able to boost the coverage by over
50% without much of a power increase.

39:59.403 --> 40:02.952
That should be enough
for a sizeable population growth.

40:03.123 --> 40:06.160
Thank you. You have no idea
how long the shield will last?

40:06.323 --> 40:10.999
There's no way of knowing, but there's
a good chance you'll be a grandparent.

40:11.883 --> 40:14.522
We'd be happy to come back
and check in on you.

40:14.683 --> 40:17.322
Ford could explain
how to be a 25-year-old.

40:17.483 --> 40:21.158
- I'll look forward to it.
- You'll have to get used to a few things.

40:21.323 --> 40:23.883
But we can talk about that
next time we visit.

40:24.043 --> 40:27.922
- Just promise me you'll stick around.
- I will.

40:28.083 --> 40:30.392
All the villages agreed
to suspend sacrifices?

40:30.563 --> 40:34.112
They will require us to change some laws,
but for now, yes.

40:37.483 --> 40:39.917
- Sir.
- Oh, right. Here.

40:41.563 --> 40:42.962
What's this?

40:43.123 --> 40:46.513
Where we're from, you get presents
when you turn a year older.

40:50.563 --> 40:52.633
See him there.

40:52.803 --> 40:54.998
Happy birthday.

41:00.683 --> 41:02.674
Here we go.

41:04.843 --> 41:07.232
Here you go. One for you.
