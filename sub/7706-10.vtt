[music on TV]

00:07.308 --> 00:09.341
What are you watching?

00:09.343 --> 00:12.544
I'm watching you spill popcorn
all over the floor.

00:13.481 --> 00:16.248
Oh, yeah.
Careful where you step.

00:17.018 --> 00:18.951
Oh, "Casablanca!"

00:18.953 --> 00:20.986
Yeah. Great film.

00:20.988 --> 00:24.390
I've seen it so many times.

00:24.392 --> 00:27.659
Well, then you won't mind
if I change the channel.

00:27.661 --> 00:29.328
ALF!

00:29.330 --> 00:31.930
Willie, it's Godzilla week
on Channel 6.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.401
Stop the presses!

00:35.403 --> 00:38.504
They're showing
"Godzilla Vs. The Thing"

00:38.506 --> 00:40.572
"Godzilla Vs. King Kong"

00:40.574 --> 00:44.176
and "Godzilla
Vs. The Smog Monster."

00:44.178 --> 00:46.178
Guess which one this is?

00:46.180 --> 00:48.080
I'm not guessing.

00:48.082 --> 00:49.715
I'll give you a hint.

00:49.717 --> 00:52.618
[coughing]

00:55.189 --> 00:58.023
"Godzilla Vs. The Smog Monster?"

00:58.025 --> 00:59.591
[imitates a buzzer]
Wrong!

00:59.593 --> 01:00.859
Wrong?

01:00.861 --> 01:02.361
Why were you coughing?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.997
Popcorn stuck in my throat.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.533
Uh, ALF, I don't think
you should watch this movie.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.935
You know how they always
give you nightmares.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.405
Correction!
<i> Used to</i> give me nightmares!

01:13.407 --> 01:16.442
I've matured since
"The Blob" festival.

02:30.784 --> 02:31.783
Oh, you look nice.

02:31.785 --> 02:32.918
Oh, thanks.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.653
You know,
I don't feel right

02:34.655 --> 02:37.789
about going to see
this play by myself.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.825
Well, would you feel better
if I went with you

02:39.827 --> 02:42.961
and ALF destroyed the house
while we were gone?

02:42.963 --> 02:46.298
You're right, it's nice to know
that when I come home

02:46.300 --> 02:48.167
there'll be a home..

02:48.169 --> 02:50.169
...to come home to.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.537
Well, it won't last forever.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.138
He's just always
more destructive

02:53.140 --> 02:55.274
during hockey season.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.875
[shattering]

02:56.877 --> 02:59.378
I'm gonna tell him
that we're going out separately

02:59.380 --> 03:00.812
and it's<i> just</i> because of him

03:00.814 --> 03:02.514
and that he's
<i>got</i> to learn to behave himself.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.649
No, don't do that.

03:03.651 --> 03:04.983
Whenever he tries
to behave himself

03:04.985 --> 03:07.452
he gets nervous,
he breaks even more things.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.454
[clanking]

03:09.456 --> 03:11.723
How many more things
can there be?

03:14.195 --> 03:16.995
Say, what was all that noise?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.063
I don't know.

03:18.065 --> 03:21.400
As my old Grandpa Satchel
used to say

03:21.402 --> 03:22.534
"Don't look back.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.837
Something might be broken."

03:25.839 --> 03:27.639
Well, in this case,
it's my casserole dish

03:27.641 --> 03:29.675
and the cookie jar.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.009
Hey, Willie,
where are you going?

03:31.011 --> 03:33.512
Well, I'm gonna go
see a musical.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.347
Musicals are dumb!

03:35.349 --> 03:38.183
Out of the blue
people burst into song.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.919
Hence, the term musical.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.688
Yeah, but wouldn't it
get on your nerves

03:42.690 --> 03:45.357
if all of a sudden
I started singing

03:45.359 --> 03:46.692
¶ Hey Kate ¶

03:46.694 --> 03:48.160
¶ Ain't it great ¶

03:48.162 --> 03:49.328
¶ Hey Willie ¶

03:49.330 --> 03:51.029
¶ You look silly
Hey-- ¶¶

03:51.031 --> 03:52.998
It's getting on my nerves!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.499
See what I mean?

03:54.501 --> 03:56.435
What's this stinker called?

03:56.437 --> 03:58.170
"Cats."

04:00.107 --> 04:01.540
Take me, please!

04:01.542 --> 04:03.208
Afterwards, we'll go backstage

04:03.210 --> 04:05.544
and eat the actors.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.912
Well, they're not real cats

04:06.914 --> 04:09.514
they're actors dressed up
to look like cats.

04:09.516 --> 04:12.851
Well, pwah! I'll pass.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.387
How come you're not
going with your mate, Kate?

04:15.389 --> 04:17.956
Well, um..

04:17.958 --> 04:20.058
...actually, um, ahem,
do you remember a while back

04:20.060 --> 04:23.662
we, we left you alone, and you,
ahem, blew up the kitchen?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.298
Oh, yeah.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.066
I get nervous
just thinking about it.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.701
[glass rattling]

04:30.704 --> 04:32.204
Uh, well, uh, I'm not going

04:32.206 --> 04:33.572
because I-I don't feel well.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.475
I have a fever. A slight fever.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.644
Oh, well, let me press my lips

04:38.646 --> 04:40.412
against your forehead.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.647
No!

04:43.284 --> 04:45.484
You don't sound that sick.

04:46.553 --> 04:49.054
Is there something wrong
between you two?

04:49.056 --> 04:50.756
Of course not.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.924
You wouldn't lie
to the old ALFer?

04:52.926 --> 04:53.792
Well, no.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.927
Because I always tell the truth.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.730
Example, your socks are limp.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.266
- Goodbye, Willie.
- Bye.

05:01.268 --> 05:03.101
- Have a good time.
- Bye.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.438
And those glasses
make you look owlish.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.906
Goodbye, ALF.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.143
Did I mention
he has a funny walk?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.080
[instrumental music]

05:16.083 --> 05:18.350
¶ Da-da da da da da-a-a ¶¶

05:18.352 --> 05:20.552
Alright, let's go for three.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.524
Come on, Bri, time for bed.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.959
But ALF's teaching me
how to juggle.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.195
New rule,
no juggling with glasses.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.798
Oh, great.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.966
First, no juggling with plates.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.502
Now, no juggling with glasses.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.339
What's next? Lucky?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.541
No juggling with the cat.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.709
Darn.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.776
There go my plans for

05:44.778 --> 05:47.245
"Circus Of The Strays."

05:48.315 --> 05:49.381
Come on, Bri.

05:49.383 --> 05:51.216
- Night, ALF.
- Night, B.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.484
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, honey.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.052
- How was your date?
- It was fun!

05:54.054 --> 05:56.054
Okay, I want to hear all about
it after I put Bri to bed.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.191
- Okay.
- I wanna hear all about it too.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.492
Bri.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.627
I thought you hated
that smushy stuff.

06:02.629 --> 06:05.030
I like it better
than going to bed.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.899
Cute<i> repartee,</i> huh?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.501
Adorable.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.537
So, did you ask Lizard
to marry you?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.339
No, why would I do that?

06:14.341 --> 06:17.008
Well, don't you want
to be Mrs. Lynn Lizard?

06:17.010 --> 06:20.812
Living in a nice little cottage
with a white picket fence?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.814
I hadn't thought about it.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.850
Well, think about it.

06:24.852 --> 06:28.687
I'm gonna need a place to crash
when your parents get a divorce.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.689
My parents
aren't getting divorced.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.191
Don't be so sure.

06:33.193 --> 06:36.995
I'm a student of the breakup
of the nuclear family.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.497
No, you're not.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.531
Alright.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.699
I'm a student of the breakup

06:40.701 --> 06:43.268
of a planet by nuclear boo-boo.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.939
But I do know
when a romance is dying.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.676
ALF, my parents'
romance isn't dying.

06:51.678 --> 06:54.780
Then why are they always
doing things separately?

06:54.782 --> 06:56.848
It can't be because of me.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.784
Perish the thought.

06:58.786 --> 07:02.087
Well, look, we can't take
a chance that something's wrong.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.389
We must take action.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.457
Must we?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.892
Trust me on this one.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.895
I've been wrong
so many times before.

07:09.897 --> 07:13.131
[instrumental music]

07:15.736 --> 07:17.869
Mom and dad wanna know
if they can come out now.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.639
Yeah, just as soon as
I spit-shine these plates.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.242
[expectorates]
That won't be necessary.

07:24.244 --> 07:27.379
Fine, let 'em eat off
dirty dishes.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.747
You can come out now!

07:28.749 --> 07:31.316
Wait, wait, wait!
Cover your eyes first!

07:31.318 --> 07:33.718
Oh, is that really necessary?

07:33.720 --> 07:35.387
(ALF)
'Humor me.'

07:35.389 --> 07:36.788
Willie, no fair peeking!

07:36.790 --> 07:38.757
(Willie)
Ow!

07:38.759 --> 07:40.492
I guess you weren't peeking.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.094
Okay, open.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.329
ALF!

07:45.299 --> 07:47.165
What is the occasion?

07:47.167 --> 07:51.069
Well, on Melmac, it's National
Rag-On-The-Martians Day

07:51.071 --> 07:53.905
but here, it's just
Kate-And-Willie Day.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.607
'Now, come on,
sit down, you two.'

07:55.609 --> 07:57.275
Enjoy. Lunch.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.277
- Well, thank you!
- Thank you, ALF.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.747
I was going to prepare
a lovely chateaubriand

08:02.749 --> 08:05.083
but I have no idea what that is.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.918
So you're getting hamburgers.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.453
- And champagne.
- Yeah.

08:08.455 --> 08:10.021
It's dry and fruity

08:10.023 --> 08:12.324
with just a hint of wackiness.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.825
I even dropped in
a worm for that

08:13.827 --> 08:16.761
south-of-the-border flavor.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.631
Uh, no, I'll,
uh, I'll pass.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.099
Alright, I'll give it to Lucky.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.969
He loves this imported stuff.

08:23.971 --> 08:26.505
No, no, ALF,
give that to me.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.939
Listen, I want to know..

08:27.941 --> 08:29.140
...why you did all this.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.775
Well, I merely wanted you two

08:30.777 --> 08:33.478
to have a nice
candlelight dinner at home.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.846
The two of you.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.849
Willie and Kate,
Kate and Willie

08:37.851 --> 08:40.652
husband and wife, man and woman

08:40.654 --> 08:42.854
circle with an arrow pointing up

08:42.856 --> 08:45.824
circle with a little cross
pointing down.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.158
That's enough, ALF.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.361
- Well, well, see you later.
- Thank you.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.629
You know what they say?

08:50.631 --> 08:53.465
"Two's company,
three is a crowd."

08:53.467 --> 08:55.967
Four is, uh, two companies.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.003
Five is a crowd and a company.

08:58.005 --> 09:01.973
Six. Six could either be three
companies or two crowds.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.009
I'll have my burger medium.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.578
Medium?
They're all the same size.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.246
Extra large.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.917
What do you think
he's up to?

09:11.919 --> 09:13.018
I don't know.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.519
But until we find out

09:14.521 --> 09:16.488
we might just as well enjoy it.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.256
He has created
a nice atmosphere.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.692
Yeah, you know,
I feel underdressed

09:20.694 --> 09:22.327
in my own living room.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.162
Gangway, coming through

09:24.164 --> 09:26.131
soup and salad!

09:28.335 --> 09:30.235
In one pot.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.203
How convenient.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.873
Hey, less dishes
for you to wash, Kate.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.375
I wanted this night
to be perfect.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.344
Now you two lovebirds

09:39.346 --> 09:41.446
talk amongst yourselves.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.689
He's odd.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.857
E-even for an alien.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.060
You know,
I think I just figured out

09:55.062 --> 09:57.195
why he's doing all this.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.397
He thinks we're having
marital problems.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.566
Wh-why would you say that?

10:01.568 --> 10:03.201
I don't know, the-the dinner

10:03.203 --> 10:06.071
the way he's trying
to get us to be roman..

10:06.073 --> 10:08.740
Maybe he overheard us
arguing last night.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.575
That wasn't an argument.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.043
That was
a difference of opinion.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.578
I just don't happen
to think that Lynn

10:13.580 --> 10:16.081
is old enough
to go on a ski trip.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.750
She's 17,
that's not too young.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.986
Let's not,
let's not start again.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.189
It was settled last night.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.394
Actually, nothing was settled.
You fell asleep.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.262
Before I fell asleep

10:31.264 --> 10:33.431
I remember, you said
you agreed with me.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.600
(Kate)
'Willie, I was going
on trips like this'

10:35.602 --> 10:37.135
when I was younger than Lynn.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.471
I wouldn't have approved
of that either.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.806
Well, I'm surprised
you let me go on our honeymoon.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.241
Oh, that's just ludicrous.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.343
(Kate)
'Ludicrous?'

10:45.345 --> 10:46.578
What's going on?

10:46.580 --> 10:47.746
Willie, I think that it's time

10:47.748 --> 10:49.848
for you to step into the '80s.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.783
Could we continue
this argument in private?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.118
- Oh, argument, argument.
- Please?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.619
I thought that this was
a difference of opinion!

10:54.621 --> 10:56.121
- 'I was wrong.'
- Well.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.922
That's not the only thing
you were wrong about.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.125
- 'Says who?'
- 'You are so unreasonable.'

11:00.127 --> 11:03.028
Told you this marriage
is on the rocks.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.864
[instrumental music]

11:07.501 --> 11:09.167
[instrumental music]

11:12.105 --> 11:14.339
No, Julie, he hasn't called yet.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.774
Well, how can he call
when you keep

11:15.776 --> 11:16.941
calling to see if he called?

11:16.943 --> 11:19.511
Quick! Quick! Hang up! Hang up!

11:19.513 --> 11:20.845
Dial 9-1-1!

11:20.847 --> 11:22.113
Nine,<i> uno, uno!</i>

11:22.115 --> 11:23.481
I-I gotta go!
I'll talk to you later, bye!

11:23.483 --> 11:25.450
Hurry up!

11:25.452 --> 11:27.452
Wait a minute,
I don't smell smoke.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.487
Where is it written
that all my emergencies

11:29.489 --> 11:31.856
have to involve fire?

11:31.858 --> 11:32.891
Sorry.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.192
It's Willie and Kate.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.494
They've been fighting
all night!

11:36.496 --> 11:38.530
Were you listening
outside their door again?

11:38.532 --> 11:39.898
Inside their door.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.533
Under their bed.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.402
Anyway, I distinctly
heard someone say

11:44.404 --> 11:47.505
"Get off it!
It isn't ALF's fault."

11:47.507 --> 11:49.040
That was probably mom.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.309
Well, actually, it was me.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.878
Then they walked out
on each other, Lynn.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.513
I'm an orphan!

11:55.515 --> 11:58.149
I don't want to be an orphan.
I saw "Annie."

11:58.151 --> 12:00.852
Orphans have to eat gruel

12:00.854 --> 12:03.321
and tap dance with mops.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.190
Listen to me.

12:05.192 --> 12:07.926
Mom and dad
haven't abandoned us.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.662
They're having a little fight,
that's all.

12:10.664 --> 12:13.898
I just hope mom wins,
so I can go on that ski trip.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.701
They won't settle anything
without our help.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.369
Our help?

12:18.371 --> 12:19.871
Please, Lynn?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.040
This is the only family
that I've got.

12:22.042 --> 12:25.276
This is the only family
I've got.

12:25.278 --> 12:28.646
Really? Well, no wonder
you're always hanging around.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.416
Now, let's see.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.919
How would we solve
this problem on Melmac?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.187
Let me guess.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.723
You'd play
tug-of-war with a cat.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.225
No.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.560
That only takes
your mind off your troubles.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.662
It never solves anything.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.299
Well, wait. I remember.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.401
To get a couple back together

12:50.403 --> 12:54.239
we'd recreate the happiest
moment of their marriage.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.041
I wonder what mom and dad's
happiest moment was.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.744
The day they met me?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.146
Think again.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.081
The day after they met me.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.482
Keep thinking.

13:04.484 --> 13:07.252
I can't! My brain hurts!

13:07.254 --> 13:08.686
Ah-h-h.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.956
Well, they're always
talking about

13:11.958 --> 13:14.225
how much they enjoyed
their honeymoon.

13:15.162 --> 13:17.962
Great! Yeah, yeah, that's it!

13:17.964 --> 13:20.632
Let's recreate their honeymoon.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.733
Where did they go?

13:21.735 --> 13:23.835
Niagara Falls.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.504
Oh, real original.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.572
[instrumental music]

13:27.574 --> 13:29.107
Well, what do you think?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.441
You know, it does
look a little like

13:30.443 --> 13:32.777
the hotel where
mom and dad stayed.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.180
Quick, take your position.

13:35.816 --> 13:37.348
ALF? ALF?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.184
(ALF)
'Ring the bell, Willie.'

13:40.654 --> 13:42.153
What's going on h..

13:42.155 --> 13:45.423
You said this was an emergency!

13:45.425 --> 13:46.958
(ALF)
'Ring the bell, Willie!'

13:46.960 --> 13:49.394
- What bell?
- 'Oh, sorry.'

13:50.964 --> 13:53.231
'Ring the bell, Willie.'

13:55.502 --> 13:57.268
[bell dings]

13:58.638 --> 14:00.438
You rang?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.874
What's the emergency?

14:02.876 --> 14:03.975
Ring the bell, Kate.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.978
Tell us what the emergency is!

14:06.980 --> 14:10.782
It'll be self-explanatory.
<i> Voila!</i>

14:10.784 --> 14:12.183
[bell dinging]

14:12.185 --> 14:14.586
May I take your bags?

14:15.722 --> 14:16.788
What bags?

14:16.790 --> 14:18.489
Right there.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.458
What are those doing up here?

14:20.460 --> 14:23.862
Don't ask me. I just work here.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.330
[bell dinging]

14:25.332 --> 14:28.299
You must be Mr. and Mrs. Tanner.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.134
Welcome to Niagara Falls.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.136
- Niagara Falls?
- Yes.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.471
See, ALF came up
with a way for you two

14:33.473 --> 14:36.040
to stop being mad at each other.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.009
We're not mad at each other.

14:38.011 --> 14:41.012
Too late. We're going
through with this.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.513
How do you do?

14:42.515 --> 14:45.583
I am Fritz<i> von</i> Fingerhoff.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.052
On behalf of my staff..

14:48.054 --> 14:49.854
...welcome to the beautiful

14:49.856 --> 14:53.191
Duke Of The Mist Hotel.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.993
- Duke Of The Mist..
- Duke Of The Mist.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.195
It's where we
spent our honeymoon.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.864
Who's Fritz<i> von</i> Fingerhoff?

14:59.866 --> 15:02.500
Beats me. I just liked the name.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.536
So, I-I gather
this is supposed to be

15:05.538 --> 15:08.172
kind of a second honeymoon
then, right?

15:08.174 --> 15:11.042
Wrong, a first honeymoon.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.710
Now, imagine

15:12.712 --> 15:16.614
it's July 11th, 1967.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.349
The summer of love.

15:18.351 --> 15:22.186
Outside is Niagara Falls.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.057
Shh-shh-shh.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.559
- I feel the spray.
- Shh-shh..

15:28.561 --> 15:29.427
Sorry.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.396
Willie Tanner
and Kate Halligan

15:31.398 --> 15:32.964
have just been married.

15:32.966 --> 15:36.467
Kate's mother Dorothy
cries buckets and buckets

15:36.469 --> 15:39.904
before, during,
and after the ceremony.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.407
How do you know so much
about our wedding?

15:42.409 --> 15:44.542
I showed him
your wedding album.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.911
Willie, never wear tails again.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.913
- And, Kate--
- Careful!

15:48.915 --> 15:50.648
You were a lovely bride.

15:50.650 --> 15:51.749
Thank you.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.051
Back to the wedding.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.719
Willie's uncle Ned makes a scene

15:54.721 --> 15:57.088
when he pops his suspenders
doing the twist.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.423
You remember that?

15:58.425 --> 16:00.491
I remember the look
on Aunt Agnes' face

16:00.493 --> 16:03.561
when uncle Ned mooned the room.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.330
Stretch, get them out of here.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.565
Show them to their
honeymoon<i> suite.</i>

16:07.567 --> 16:09.100
- Stretch?
- Yeah.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.568
We couldn't get
the real Stretch.

16:10.570 --> 16:14.339
He tried going over the falls
in a barrel in '72.

16:14.341 --> 16:18.242
I emphasize the word "tried."

16:18.244 --> 16:20.144
Right this way.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.013
Oh, uh, thank you, Stretch.

16:22.015 --> 16:25.116
Oh, wait. First, won't you
please sign the register?

16:25.118 --> 16:26.818
[chuckles]
Oh, the..

16:28.021 --> 16:29.620
The, uh..

16:29.622 --> 16:30.822
[scoffs]

16:30.824 --> 16:32.590
"Mr. & Mrs. Smith?"

16:32.592 --> 16:36.494
Willie, that's the same joke
you tried 20 years ago.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.263
The desk clerk didn't laugh
at it then either.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.232
We checked it out.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.502
Oh, uh, one more thing.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.538
I trust you won't be stealing
our towels and ashtrays.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.641
We'd never do a thing like that!

16:50.643 --> 16:53.444
[clears throat]

16:53.446 --> 16:55.446
I found this in the basement.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.952
Without further ado

17:00.954 --> 17:04.322
I present the honeymoon sweet.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.290
"Honeymoon sweet."

17:06.292 --> 17:08.159
Wait a minute...
isn't someone gonna

17:08.161 --> 17:09.560
carry the bride
over the threshold?

17:09.562 --> 17:10.628
(Kate and Willie)
Oh!

17:10.630 --> 17:12.897
Okay, but if I get a hernia

17:12.899 --> 17:14.065
you're looking at a lawsuit.

17:14.067 --> 17:15.333
Come on, Kate.

17:15.335 --> 17:19.137
ALF! ALF!

17:19.139 --> 17:21.005
- No.
- Go on, dad, pick her up.

17:21.007 --> 17:22.974
Yeah, dad.
Whisk her off her feet.

17:22.976 --> 17:25.009
Oh, what the heck.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.078
Oh, honey! Ah.

17:27.080 --> 17:30.248
Alright, Willie,
you Tarzan you!

17:37.657 --> 17:40.358
What happened to our bedroom?

17:40.360 --> 17:43.261
ALF redecorated it.
Tacky, huh?

17:43.863 --> 17:44.862
Very.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.197
You, you can see why

17:46.199 --> 17:49.100
we keep this furniture
in the basement.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.202
Well, I wanted
to put you in the mood.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.937
I've turned the bedroom

17:52.939 --> 17:54.539
into an exact replica

17:54.541 --> 17:57.275
of your honeymoon<i> suite.</i>

17:57.277 --> 18:00.244
Where did you get
this "Hotel" sign?

18:00.246 --> 18:01.946
Well, remember that sign
that you had

18:01.948 --> 18:04.715
that said, "Happy Noel?"

18:04.717 --> 18:08.853
I'll bet you didn't know
I was a master glassblower.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.755
I bet you didn't know
I bought that sign

18:10.757 --> 18:12.990
for Lynn
for her first Christmas.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.595
And I bet you didn't know

18:17.597 --> 18:21.732
that I paid 200 dollars
for it either.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.234
Well, there's so much
about each other

18:23.236 --> 18:24.769
that we don't know.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.906
May I put your bags down?

18:28.908 --> 18:30.408
Certainly, my good man.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.978
Why, thank you, Stretch!

18:33.980 --> 18:36.647
Why, thank you.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.449
Oh, someday
I want to have a little boy

18:38.451 --> 18:40.818
just like Stretch!

18:40.820 --> 18:42.453
If I can be
of further assistance

18:42.455 --> 18:44.655
please don't hesitate to ask.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.424
And a girl.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.759
Like Consuela.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.762
Oh, and if you make up your mind
about the ski trip

18:51.764 --> 18:53.698
please notify the front desk.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.301
Well, we've done our part.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.337
Now it's your turn.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.507
[chuckles]

19:05.812 --> 19:07.111
A nickel?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.714
Don't expect clean sheets!

19:15.088 --> 19:17.321
Well, this is kind of silly.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.823
Yeah.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.358
But, boy, this stuff

19:20.360 --> 19:23.261
really brings back
memories, doesn't it?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.795
It sure does.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.998
Oh, Willie,
it seems like our honeymoon

19:27.000 --> 19:29.300
was only yesterday.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.103
Oh, you were so handsome.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.639
I don't care what ALF says,
I loved you in tails.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.974
I'll tell you one thing
that he got right.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.610
- You sure were a lovely bride.
- Aw.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.878
You know something?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.381
You know what I remember most
about that day?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.849
What?

19:44.851 --> 19:47.218
How much I loved you.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.987
- And I still do.
- Oh, Willie.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.155
I love you too.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.324
Kate, I'm sorry
about our fight.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.659
No, it wasn't a fight.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.061
It was a difference of opinion.

19:57.063 --> 19:59.063
[both chuckling]

19:59.065 --> 20:00.598
[instrumental music]

20:02.502 --> 20:04.569
- What?
- Oh, oh, uh..

20:04.571 --> 20:06.370
No, I-I-I was just thinking.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.005
Don't you remember
what happened just..

20:08.007 --> 20:09.507
...on our honeymoon
just at that instant

20:09.509 --> 20:11.709
we were starting
our first kiss?

20:12.545 --> 20:13.744
The water pipes burst.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.117
Go ahead, Willie,
give her a big smack!

20:21.421 --> 20:23.354
Hit it, Brian!

20:23.356 --> 20:25.423
No! No!

20:26.526 --> 20:29.126
[Willie screaming]

20:31.931 --> 20:33.231
You want some more tea,
honey?

20:33.233 --> 20:34.732
Oh, no. Thanks.
But leave the pot.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.536
I want to bask in it's warmth.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.738
Question?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.773
- Shoot.
- No! Don't shoot!

20:42.775 --> 20:44.875
I just want to ask you
a question.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.879
- Ask.
- Are you mad at me?

20:48.881 --> 20:52.216
You mean, because you,
you soaked us with a hose.

20:52.218 --> 20:55.019
Ruined our mattress,
destroyed our wallpaper

20:55.021 --> 20:57.021
and warped our floor?

20:57.023 --> 21:00.524
Hey, don't forget,
I shorted out that hotel sign.

21:00.526 --> 21:01.892
How can we forget?

21:01.894 --> 21:03.561
That's when the fire department
hosed me down

21:03.563 --> 21:05.429
for the second time.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.232
So you are mad.

21:08.234 --> 21:10.368
No, we're not.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.104
Boy, what does it take?

21:13.106 --> 21:15.139
The reason we're not mad at you

21:15.141 --> 21:17.808
in spite of that hideous chain
of events

21:17.810 --> 21:20.745
is because you were trying

21:20.747 --> 21:22.713
to do something wonderful for us

21:22.715 --> 21:26.384
and I think you did,
you helped us

21:26.386 --> 21:28.919
put romance back in our lives'.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.656
You mean I don't have
to do anymore?

21:31.658 --> 21:34.258
Oh, what else
have you got planned?

21:34.260 --> 21:36.460
Oh, nothing.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.928
Let's think for a minute.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.564
After the sturgeon in the tub..

21:40.566 --> 21:44.135
Ah, we went to dinner
at that darling little cafe.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.603
We, oh, we went to dinner

21:45.605 --> 21:47.338
the table collapsed,
everything fell on the floor.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.673
Yes!

21:54.113 --> 21:55.846
Pure co-incidence.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.919
[instrumental music]

22:01.921 --> 22:04.288
Honey, I just don't feel good
about leaving you like this.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.123
Well, no, you go.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.825
There's no use
both of us staying home

22:07.827 --> 22:09.827
just because I'm sick.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.929
Uh, say hello, say hello
to your mother for me.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.531
Okay. Muah.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.733
I'll be thinking about you.

22:17.937 --> 22:18.936
[sneezes]

22:22.342 --> 22:23.908
[sighs]

22:24.544 --> 22:25.643
Where's she going?

22:25.645 --> 22:28.479
Oh, she's going
to her mother's.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.147
Without you?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.315
Oh, I get it.

22:31.317 --> 22:32.817
Lynn's on her ski trip

22:32.819 --> 22:34.685
and you don't trust me
to be alone.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.521
No, sure we do,
ALF, but I'm sick.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.490
I-I caught cold because somebody

22:39.492 --> 22:41.992
hosed me down in my own bedroom.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.894
Oh, baloney.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.029
- ALF!
- Come on!

22:45.031 --> 22:46.564
Get up and go to your
mother-in-law.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.532
- No!
- Yes!

22:48.534 --> 22:50.134
Oh.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.169
Alright.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.171
Gee, Willie,
you do look a little pale.

22:54.173 --> 22:55.806
You might be coming down
with something.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.342
- You better lie down.
- Oh, thanks.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.844
That's a good idea.

22:59.846 --> 23:02.480
- Let me tuck you in.
- Okay.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.549
- There you go.
- Thanks, ALF.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.318
You're a good friend.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.321
Hey, anything for my Willie.

23:10.323 --> 23:12.189
You want me to press my lips
up against your forehead?

23:12.191 --> 23:13.190
No.
