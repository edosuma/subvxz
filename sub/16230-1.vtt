02:03.331 --> 02:06.792
TOUR LEADER: ...during which you'll see
all the man-made and natural beauties

02:06.876 --> 02:09.627
- of the most spectacular bay in the world.
- (SHIP HORN BLOWING)

02:09.711 --> 02:12.381
You'll pass beneath
the famous Golden Gate Bridge,

02:12.465 --> 02:14.383
considered by most authorities

02:14.425 --> 02:18.220
to be one of the most striking structures
ever erected by man.

02:18.721 --> 02:23.308
From the bay, you will thrill
to the magnificent San Francisco skyline.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.729
Your cruise ship, the Harbor King,
will circle Alcatraz,

02:27.897 --> 02:32.484
a maximum security prison containing
the most dangerous criminals in America.

02:32.569 --> 02:36.280
It has been the home of
such notorious figures as Al Capone,

02:36.364 --> 02:39.074
Baby Face Nelson and Machine Gun Kelly.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.252
GADDIS: That's the island of Alcatraz.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.299
There's a man leaving there today
after 17 years' imprisonment.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.551
His name is Robert Stroud.

02:59.846 --> 03:05.434
He's spent most of his life behind bars,
including 43 years in solitary confinement.

03:07.562 --> 03:11.106
He has never used a telephone
or driven an automobile.

03:11.900 --> 03:16.695
The last time he broke bread
with another human being was in 1916,

03:17.238 --> 03:21.783
the year Kaiser Wilhelm ordered
the sinking of the Lusitania in World War I.

03:26.748 --> 03:28.624
My name is Tom Gaddis.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.251
I wrote a book about this man.

03:36.382 --> 03:40.302
GADDIS: Our story properly begins
in the year 1912.

03:40.386 --> 03:43.764
A cargo of rebellious prisoners
was being transferred

03:43.806 --> 03:47.100
from the federal penitentiary
at McNeil Island, Washington,

03:47.143 --> 03:48.560
to "The Big Top,"

03:48.645 --> 03:52.606
the name given by convicts
to the prison at Leavenworth, Kansas.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.652
(COUGHING)

04:18.466 --> 04:20.050
(GLASS SHATTERING)

04:20.134 --> 04:22.594
- (MEN YELLING)
- MAN: Break another one!

04:23.638 --> 04:24.846
Shut up!

04:26.683 --> 04:29.393
You make one more move,
and I'll take you off at the neck.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.438
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING)

04:42.031 --> 04:43.699
Robert F. Stroud.

04:49.747 --> 04:52.207
Breaking that train window
was a serious offense.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.710
It was hot. I was thinking of my lungs.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.587
Did you think about
the possible consequences?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.298
You might have started a riot.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.174
Even a convict's got a right to breathe.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.845
Rights? I don't think
you know the meaning of the word.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.307
In 1909, in Alaska,

05:08.725 --> 05:10.892
you appointed yourself
judge, jury, and executioner,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.812
and killed one Charles Donner

05:13.896 --> 05:17.441
because he allegedly beat up a friend
named Katie Malone,

05:17.734 --> 05:18.859
a prostitute.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.822
Stroud, you were transferred here
to Leavenworth

05:23.906 --> 05:25.824
because of an inferior record.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.076
Now, I propose to give you a fresh start.

05:28.703 --> 05:33.165
Such rights as you will enjoy
are listed here in my rules and regulations.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.251
There are 86 of them.
I suggest you memorize them.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.254
I know them. They're the same in all pens.

05:39.756 --> 05:43.175
They tell you when to eat, when to sleep,
when to go to the privy.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.593
Precisely.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.180
And what you'll do for every minute,
24 hours a day.

05:49.640 --> 05:53.018
You're going to be here
for nine long years, Stroud.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.522
So, with or without your cooperation,
I intend to make a man of you

05:57.607 --> 05:59.900
before you check out these gates.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.986
You'll conform to our ideas
of how you should behave.

06:03.071 --> 06:07.324
You'll learn the lesson now, or you'll learn it
five years from now, but you'll learn.

06:10.953 --> 06:12.037
For breaking that train window,

06:12.121 --> 06:14.998
all your privileges are suspended
for 30 days.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.250
That's all, Mr. Ransom.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.294
Let's go.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.972
QUALEN: You're one of the new fish
from McNeil, huh?

06:32.308 --> 06:33.475
Yeah.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.646
I'm Tony Qualen. Who are you?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.065
Stroud.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.986
You're lucky to be in this cell block.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.158
The boss here is a friend of mine.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.703
Picture of your mother?

06:54.664 --> 06:55.705
Put it back.

06:59.001 --> 07:00.085
Put it back.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.432
What'd I do?

07:14.892 --> 07:17.018
Just don't touch it again.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.543
You know the guy
you're bunking with? Anthony?

07:42.503 --> 07:47.048
Understand that you and him
had a little misunderstanding.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.636
Anthony is a friend of mine,

07:53.389 --> 07:55.223
a very good friend.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.186
He didn't mean nothing
picking up the picture.

07:59.228 --> 08:00.562
Beat it.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.403
What kind of nut are you anyway, friend?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.447
Just because he picked up
a picture of Mama?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.408
(EXCLAIMS)

08:14.994 --> 08:16.495
(MEN CLAMORING)

08:29.634 --> 08:30.967
Break it up!

08:31.302 --> 08:33.260
Stroud! Stroud!

08:37.933 --> 08:40.769
You ever mention my mother again,
I'll kill you!

08:54.450 --> 08:55.617
Stroud.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.621
What's the matter, man?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.543
What's eating you up inside, Bob?

09:05.419 --> 09:07.837
You act as though
you hate everyone in the world.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.924
You live in a pus hole, you act accordingly.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.886
All right, Bob.

09:15.471 --> 09:18.848
Maybe 30 days in the hole will
make you happy to see a human face again.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.142
Don't count on it, Harvey.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.833
I don't think 30 days in the hole
are gonna cool that jaybird off, Warden.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.586
What do you suggest, Mr. Kramer?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.672
He's as mean as a boar hog.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.299
If it was me,

09:52.341 --> 09:55.427
I'd keep him away from
the rest of the inmates, permanently.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.636
- Isolation?
- Yes, sir.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.723
No. I don't give up on a man that easily.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.350
Stroud comes from good stock.

10:02.393 --> 10:03.852
He'll shape up.

10:04.186 --> 10:07.772
He's a dingbat, Warden. He's dangerous.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.526
He's my responsibility, Mr. Kramer.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.779
Now, you let me worry about his behavior.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.449
Yes, sir.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.553
(SQUEAKING)

10:56.072 --> 10:57.781
RANSOM: All right, Stroud.

11:43.452 --> 11:47.580
STROUD: Dearest Mother, I am feeling fine.
Hope you are the same.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.458
Everything is okay at this end.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.795
Time sure does fly.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.632
Yesterday was my fourth anniversary here.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.635
But I got no cake. Ha-ha.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.724
I guess everything would be all right
if I could just see you

12:05.808 --> 12:08.101
and give you a great big hug.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.271
I hope your cold is better.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.190
Your loving son, Robbie.

12:38.382 --> 12:42.385
ELIZABETH: Dearest Robbie,
I was here today to see you,

12:42.470 --> 12:45.680
but they would not let me in,
it being Saturday,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.807
with no visiting allowed.

12:48.142 --> 12:50.393
But I saw Warden Shoemaker,

12:50.478 --> 12:54.230
and he was kind enough
to arrange for a visit next Friday.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.358
Until then, my darling,

12:57.693 --> 13:00.945
this little gift of fruit
comes with all my love.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.822
Mother.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.414
Guard! Guard! Mr. Kramer!

13:13.334 --> 13:14.584
What do you want, Stroud?

13:14.668 --> 13:15.877
Did you know my mother was here today?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.086
Yeah.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.505
Why didn't you call me?

13:18.547 --> 13:20.757
You know the rules.
No visitors on Saturday.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.218
Is that all you got inside of you? Rules?

13:23.302 --> 13:25.804
Stop bellyaching.
She said she'd be here next week.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.680
You can see her then.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.273
You ain't got much, Stroud,
but you keep subtracting from it.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.236
Don't you know I gotta put you on report
for touching a guard?

13:44.490 --> 13:47.700
(BAND PLAYING)

14:45.467 --> 14:47.051
Mr. Kramer,

14:49.638 --> 14:52.849
you shoot me on report,
I won't get no visit from my mother.

14:52.933 --> 14:54.559
You should have thought of that before.

14:55.853 --> 14:59.522
She came 2,000 miles,
all the way from Alaska.

15:02.818 --> 15:04.193
Do me this one favor.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.156
I just follow the rules.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.158
Now get back to your seat.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.333
I tell you, I've got to see her.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.668
And I told you to get back to your seat.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.714
You ain't a man, Kramer. You're dog puke!

15:32.181 --> 15:33.514
(STABBING)

15:59.667 --> 16:02.043
I just came from Kramer's widow.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.672
I couldn't look her in the eye, Stroud.

16:09.843 --> 16:13.930
I feel responsible for her husband's death.
He warned me about you.

16:14.932 --> 16:18.393
He told me you were dangerous,
but I wouldn't listen.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.897
And now he's cold in his grave.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.902
Already, you've taken the lives
of two human beings

16:27.987 --> 16:30.571
and you haven't even
felt a twinge of conscience.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.365
What do you want me to do, cry?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.908
Say I'm sorry?

16:34.410 --> 16:36.285
I'm only sorry for Kramer's wife.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.788
And the dead man?

16:38.872 --> 16:41.374
He was fixing to brain me with his club.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.418
I protected myself.

16:44.753 --> 16:48.673
No remorse? No pity. Just an animal.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.928
Ain't that what these cages are for?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.346
Animals?

17:01.603 --> 17:04.731
I have to make out a report
about this killing.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.318
I hope that'll help to hang you.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.791
GADDIS: Stroud had three trials.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.211
The first one was declared a mistrial.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.715
In the second,
he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.885
He appealed and was granted a third trial.

17:34.219 --> 17:38.598
On June 28, 1918, he heard the final verdict.

17:39.808 --> 17:44.395
JUDGE: Therefore, it is now by the court
considered, ordered and adjudged

17:44.563 --> 17:49.233
that you be remanded to the custody
of the warden of Leavenworth Penitentiary

17:49.485 --> 17:54.405
and kept in solitary confinement there
until the eighth day of November, 1918,

17:55.324 --> 17:58.659
and then and there be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

17:58.702 --> 17:59.952
No!

18:02.081 --> 18:04.749
This sentence is unspeakable!

18:05.334 --> 18:07.251
You call this justice?

18:07.503 --> 18:10.505
You don't even know
the meaning of the word, sir.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.341
(HAMMERING)

18:24.353 --> 18:25.812
Forget it.

18:25.854 --> 18:28.606
It's "Katie, bar the door" for me. I'm done.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.775
ELIZABETH: Sit down, Robbie.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.069
Sit down.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.951
Look, Ma, you fought.

18:41.036 --> 18:43.162
You spent all your money.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.165
You got old following me from jail to jail.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.669
It's time to douse the lights.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.796
I told you before, Robbie.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.132
I will not let them kill you.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.926
I'm going to Washington, D.C. very soon.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.970
I haven't begun to fight.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.429
GUARD: Time's up.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.980
You just don't know how to quit,
do you, Ma?

19:13.610 --> 19:17.155
Did you think Mother
was gonna let them hurt my Robbie?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.539
GADDIS: Carrying a petition for clemency,

19:26.582 --> 19:30.751
Elizabeth Stroud doggedly haunted
the offices of Washington officials

19:30.794 --> 19:35.131
in an effort to gain an audience
with the President of the United States.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.634
Finally, she managed to see
Senator Ham Lewis.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.221
He reminded her of
the President's grave illness.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.183
Grasping at straws,
she pleaded with the Senator

19:45.267 --> 19:48.769
to make an appointment for her
with the President's wife.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.105
Reluctantly, he agreed.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.329
Tell me, Mrs. Stroud,

20:06.413 --> 20:08.623
why do you think
the President should intervene?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.500
Mrs. Wilson,

20:11.585 --> 20:16.172
the President is known as a symbol of
compassion throughout the whole world.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.966
I'm sure that deep in his heart,

20:19.009 --> 20:22.845
he doesn't believe
in the brutality of an eye for an eye.

20:23.972 --> 20:28.059
I've never seen your husband, but I've...
I've seen pictures of him.

20:28.894 --> 20:32.396
He has the face of a man
who has known great suffering.

20:33.690 --> 20:39.153
I think he'd understand what it means
to have the pack yapping at his heels.

20:41.740 --> 20:46.118
Mrs. Wilson, they've turned
on your husband in his fight for peace,

20:46.954 --> 20:48.246
and they've broken his heart.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.873
Mrs. Stroud, please.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.544
There's only one man left in the world
who can lend a helping hand to my son,

20:55.629 --> 20:57.630
and that's the President.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.093
Take the petition to him.

21:03.887 --> 21:07.390
I assure you... I... I give you my solemn oath,

21:09.142 --> 21:11.352
my son is a person of worth.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.689
Save him.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.776
(METAL TAPPING)

21:30.414 --> 21:32.498
GOMEZ: Stroud. Listen.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.131
Did you hear that, you cons?

21:40.215 --> 21:42.925
President Wilson commuted Stroud to life!

21:49.391 --> 21:53.019
I'll be damned. She pulled it off.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.527
(HAMMERING)

22:14.916 --> 22:17.335
I've been expecting you, Harvey.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.921
I have a telegram here from Washington.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.801
You probably know about it.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.303
I've heard.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.391
I think you will live to regret
that this wire ever came.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.102
How come?

22:35.771 --> 22:39.815
Because you're going to spend
the rest of your life in deep lock.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.651
Who says so?

22:42.736 --> 22:44.612
The Attorney General.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.953
Remember the judge's sentence?

22:52.996 --> 22:56.624
"And kept in solitary confinement
until you are hanged by the neck."

22:56.708 --> 22:58.793
Yeah, but that ain't what the judge meant.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.004
That's what the Attorney General
says he meant.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.887
Look around you, Stroud.

23:10.305 --> 23:13.808
This is going to be your home
for as long as you live.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.231
Ain't much more you can do to me, is there?

23:20.732 --> 23:24.068
A few things. Consider this.

23:25.237 --> 23:28.155
You will not be permitted to associate
with the other prisoners,

23:28.198 --> 23:30.032
not even to exercise with them.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.494
You'll eat all your meals alone
for the rest of your life.

23:33.537 --> 23:37.748
Visiting and corresponding privileges
will be limited to your immediate family.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.542
And there will be no work.

and the days and the years.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.011
Yeah.

23:51.054 --> 23:53.806
Yeah, it must have galled you
to give that order, huh, Harv?

23:53.849 --> 23:56.016
I think I've got you figured out, Shoemaker.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.143
The first day I came here,

23:57.185 --> 24:00.187
you as much as asked me
to get down on my knees and whimper.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.523
I wouldn't do it then, and I won't do it now.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.776
I won't lick your hand,
and that's what eats you, ain't it, keeper?

24:05.861 --> 24:08.904
You keep this in mind,
a man ain't whipped until he quits,

24:08.989 --> 24:11.615
and I'll never give you that pleasure.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.205

I'll do it.

All right, I'll split mine with you.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.509
What do you say?

48:50.552 --> 48:52.386
All right. Send him in.

49:01.396 --> 49:04.690
Only for about a year or so,
and then I want him back.

49:04.733 --> 49:05.900
Okay.

49:18.121 --> 49:21.290
You be careful, take it easy,
and don't mash him.

49:28.215 --> 49:31.384
You don't take care of him,
I'll bust you apart.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.666
I don't think so.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.710
Then, why don't he sing?

50:08.672 --> 50:09.964
It wouldn't be polite.

50:10.048 --> 50:11.590
Don't be smart!

50:13.927 --> 50:16.429
Feto, don't you know
a lady canary never sings?

50:18.348 --> 50:19.932
Lady canary?

50:21.268 --> 50:23.436
You mean Jack's a broad canary?

50:23.478 --> 50:25.104
Yep. A hen.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.153
Tough luck, Bob.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.406
You're stuck with a bird that don't sing.

50:36.450 --> 50:38.117

50:46.626 --> 50:49.086
Stroud cut 128 slats

50:49.796 --> 50:53.007
in addition to roof boards, tier bars,

50:53.133 --> 50:55.593
gate pieces and a handle.

50:55.969 --> 50:59.764
Every joint was charred for hardness
and hand-fitted,

51:00.182 --> 51:02.016

Stroud developed a world in microcosm

And because it was safe,
and he knew they would never turn on him,

59:12.715 --> 59:16.176
he developed a deep but private love
for his canaries

I threw him out last spring, but I guess
it was too tough for him on the outside.

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:21.463
He had to come back
where he could freeload.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:25.217
He was a born panhandler.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.494
She had a bird, too, a parrot.

01:05:17.663 --> 01:05:19.956
And he, too, was ugly also.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:27.547
One time I came up to her room,
and the door was open,

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:32.469
and she was trying to teach the parrot
to say something.

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.930
You'll get a boot out of this, Bob.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:37.182
You know what she wanted him to say?

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.018
"I love you, Peggy."

01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:43.188
Over and over, you know, she kept at him.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:45.106

So what happens?

01:06:00.164 --> 01:06:04.918
So I wind up in the can,
and I'm talking to the birds just like she did.

01:06:08.547 --> 01:06:12.550
You know, I got to admit it.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:20.058
For the first time since I've been in stir,

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.896
them baby canaries,
they make me feel good.

You know, it ain't just right
to flush Apey down the toilet bowl.

Hey, Stroud, what am I
supposed to do with him, huh?

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.802
What am I gonna do?

Hey, Bob.

GADDIS: Stroud struck back
at the oldest enemy of all.

01:07:12.778 --> 01:07:17.032
Washed the cages,
sterilized the cell from top to bottom,

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:21.453
read everything in
the prison library about birds.

01:07:22.246 --> 01:07:24.289
He learned of chemicals called oxidizers,

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:27.792
which had been used as
a poultry germicide for years.

01:07:28.252 --> 01:07:32.130
He wrote to his mother
asking for these drugs, plus equipment.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:37.302
While waiting,
he tried fantastic concoctions on his birds.

01:07:37.386 --> 01:07:40.889
Like a sulfur solution
made from the heads of matches.

01:07:51.358 --> 01:07:54.235
The birds died with increasing swiftness.

01:07:55.988 --> 01:07:59.324
The package of drugs and equipment
came from Mother.

01:07:59.825 --> 01:08:04.287
With little or no knowledge of the amount
of chemicals a canary could tolerate,

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:07.373
Stroud proceeded to
administer the oxidizers

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.084
to his sick birds.

01:08:21.096 --> 01:08:24.265
Clearly, this drug was
no cure for septic fever.

01:08:25.059 --> 01:08:28.435
But Stroud persisted,
trying different combinations.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.359
The birds still died.

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.946
However, Stroud made one discovery.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:41.282
Before death,
their temperature dropped to normal.

01:08:42.033 --> 01:08:45.620
He concluded the chemicals
were too harsh, too caustic.

01:08:46.162 --> 01:08:49.415
He decided to buffer them
with effervescent sodas.

01:08:50.042 --> 01:08:51.626
The birds died.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.880
Hey, Stroud!

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:57.799
When are you going to find
the medicine for my birds?

01:08:57.883 --> 01:09:00.051
They're dropping like flies.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.595
Wait?

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.305
I'm gonna kill them all.

01:09:14.733 --> 01:09:17.734
GADDIS: Finally,
there was only one more buffering agent left

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:21.406
in his tiny arsenal of drugs. Citrocarbonate.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.996
He combined this with potassium chlorate.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.712
He dosed his birds.

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:38.673
After that, all he could do was hope.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.344

People began to wonder
who this strange new bird doctor was.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.855
Finally, someone got curious.

(BIRDS CHIRPING)

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.489
Uh, Bob, did you enter
some kind of a contest

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.825
in one of those canary magazines?

01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:13.453
Yeah, I won the second prize,
a Roller canary.

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:14.787
Well, you better go pick it up.

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:16.998
It's in the deputy's office.

01:12:17.624 --> 01:12:18.833
Good.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:26.716
- What's up?
- Not a thing.

(DOOR CLOSES)

01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:44.776
You must be Mr. Stroud.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:52.075
Here you are, your second prize,

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:56.371
a Night Roller of St. Andreasberg stock.

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:07.173
I... I'm Mrs. Stella Johnson.
I offered the prize.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:09.258
Who let you in?

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:11.677
The warden. It took three days.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:17.141
Well, I suppose you wonder why I'm here.

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.436
Well, I... I...

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:24.357
I... I kept, uh, reading your articles
and letters to the journal.

01:13:24.650 --> 01:13:30.363
Then, I tried your cure of oxidizing agents
on one of my birds with septic fever.

01:13:30.447 --> 01:13:32.240
By golly, it worked.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:37.245
So, I... I began to wonder
who this new bird doctor was.

01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:40.498
And when you won the prize I put up,

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:44.043
my curiosity really got the best of me.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:50.675
So I... I just had to find out
who Box 7, Leavenworth, Kansas was.

01:13:51.802 --> 01:13:56.681
So I... I wrote to the, uh, postmaster
at Leavenworth and asked him.

01:13:57.558 --> 01:14:00.268
He told me it was the federal penitentiary.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.146
Why did you come to see me?

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:05.523
Well,

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:08.484
you see, I live in Shelbyville, Indiana,

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.070
and I was visiting a cousin in St. Louis,

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:13.197
and Leavenworth isn't far...

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:17.118
You were visiting in St. Louis,
and you carried him all the way with you?

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:23.291
Well, the way it was... I was going...

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:26.794
I thought...

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:28.713
Yes?

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:36.637
Mr. Stroud, I'm... I'm terribly sorry
for taking so much of your time.

01:14:38.515 --> 01:14:40.600
Good luck with the Roller.

01:14:41.393 --> 01:14:42.894
Mrs. Johnson.

01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:46.939
Thank you for bringing him.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:51.068
Actually, you know,

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:54.405
I... I did have an idea when I came here.

01:14:56.116 --> 01:14:57.241
Idea?

01:14:57.284 --> 01:14:59.327
Have you ever thought of
selling your bird remedies?

01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:02.121
A lot of bird breeders know about them.

01:15:04.249 --> 01:15:05.583
Go ahead.

01:15:07.252 --> 01:15:08.252
Well,

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:14.300
I have a little money, not much,
but I believe it would be a good investment.

01:15:14.384 --> 01:15:16.302
You make them, and I sell them.

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:20.014
I've even thought of a name,
"Stroud's Specifics."

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.184
I'll be darned.

01:15:25.604 --> 01:15:28.523
You said your name was
Mrs. Stella Johnson.

01:15:28.899 --> 01:15:30.274
I'm a widow woman.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:31.567
I see.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.322
I'm sorry.

The truth is,
about all I've got in life is my birds.

What do you know about me, Mrs. Johnson?

01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:52.296
That you killed two men.

There was even a trombone there.

You mean you made up your mind
just like that?

One thing I've learned is not to abuse time.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.916
I suggest we split everything
right down the middle,

You've heard about the formation
of the new bureau of prisons, of course.

01:19:41.735 --> 01:19:45.780
I have several directives from Washington
that will affect you personally.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.533
I wanted to read them to you myself.

The first one states that no pets of any kind
will be allowed in federal penitentiaries.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.965

of commercial enterprise.

You're exaggerating your own importance.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:28.155
These directives weren't made just for you.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.907
It applies to the entire system.

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:35.120
Prisoners now have dogs, cats, parrots,
canary birds, even monkeys.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.705
It's bad sanitation.

01:20:36.748 --> 01:20:39.208
Feeding becomes a big problem.

01:20:39.251 --> 01:20:41.794
It creates feuds among inmates.

01:20:41.878 --> 01:20:44.588
Other prisoners complain of lice and fleas.

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:47.466
The situation simply has to be cleaned up.

01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:50.135

I never thought Uncle Sam
would go back on his word.

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:09.572
Meaning what?

There's been an understanding between
the government and me for 11 years,

01:21:16.454 --> 01:21:18.581
that I could raise my birds.

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:20.791
That pledge has been broken.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:23.168
As far as I'm concerned, all bets are off.

01:21:23.253 --> 01:21:25.713
That sounds like a threat.

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:29.800
Why, Warden, you just got through
telling me that I ain't very important.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:33.304
How could I threaten
a big, powerful Washington bureau?

how you saved my neck in 1920?

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:54.491
- Yes, but I don't see...
- Publicity, that's what did it.

I don't think I follow you.

How many bird owners know I'm a convict?

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:04.168
Just a few.

01:22:04.502 --> 01:22:06.503
Then, we'll tell them.

01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:09.798
We'll tell them
how they're going to take my birds away.

01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:12.009
We'll write to newspapers, radio stations,

bird clubs, magazines.

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:18.599

The kind of thing he usually
entrusts to his mother.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:54.593
Oh, I don't know.
I... I guess the time was short.

01:22:55.303 --> 01:22:57.554
It doesn't really matter, does it?

01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.890
There's a great deal of copying to be done.

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.017
You'll follow my directions.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.477
Yes, ma'am.

01:23:03.561 --> 01:23:05.354
Start with letters to the bird clubs,

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:08.732
and when you've finished,
I'll assign you more.

Yes, ma'am.

01:23:10.902 --> 01:23:12.194

Right here on the second page
of the Kansas City Star.

01:23:15.573 --> 01:23:16.740
- Here.
- Yes.

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:22.287
That's not enough.

01:23:23.206 --> 01:23:25.207
I want the front page.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.377
We're ready now
for the next step of our campaign.

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.503
You got another idea?

01:23:29.587 --> 01:23:30.921
Yes, and it's dynamite.

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:33.590
I came across it in an old law book.

01:23:34.092 --> 01:23:36.218
Stell, you can save my neck.

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:39.430
How? Bob, you know I'd do anything.

01:23:39.514 --> 01:23:40.848
Now, listen.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:42.307
How would you like to marry me?

01:23:49.649 --> 01:23:51.984
Let me understand you now.

01:23:52.068 --> 01:23:54.319
Are you trying to tell me
that you married a man

01:23:54.404 --> 01:23:59.074
serving a life term in solitary
at Leavenworth Penitentiary?

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.326
Yes, sir. Yesterday.

01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:04.496
And, uh, where did
the ceremony take place?

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.790
At the penitentiary.

01:24:08.043 --> 01:24:10.335
By the prison chaplain, no doubt?

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:12.296
No, sir.

01:24:12.922 --> 01:24:14.882
It was a civil ceremony.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:18.385
Well, go ahead. I've listened this far.

01:24:18.762 --> 01:24:20.387
Well, you see...

01:24:21.264 --> 01:24:22.431
Yes?

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:27.644

of Paris and the Louisiana Purchase,

was to sign a declaration.

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:35.819
You see, Leavenworth
is still federal property,

01:24:35.862 --> 01:24:39.698
and is, therefore,
immune to the laws of the State of Kansas.

It's all here, sir, if you want to read it.

01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:54.630
GADDIS: Stroud got his front page, all right,

01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:57.007
and with a bang
heard all the way to Washington.

01:24:57.050 --> 01:25:01.095
Result? One of the strangest conferences
in prison history.

01:25:13.858 --> 01:25:16.318

01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:34.253
Hello, Bob.

01:25:34.337 --> 01:25:35.838
Hello, Harvey.

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:47.641
You've succeeded in creating
quite a little flurry with your birds.

01:25:48.184 --> 01:25:50.227
Just an inmate protecting his rights.

01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:52.896
Would you like to sit down?

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.064
Yes, thanks.

01:25:59.737 --> 01:26:00.946
Bob,

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.367
I've been sent here as a delegate
of the bureau to make you an offer.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:07.870
That's what I've been waiting for.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:10.205
Now, the bureau is willing
to let you to keep your birds.

01:26:10.248 --> 01:26:12.166
You can even sell them.

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:15.210
Now, this is their official proposal,

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:18.881
you can continue to raise and sell the birds,

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:22.426
but the profits will be turned over
to the prison welfare fund,

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.888
and you will receive a salary
in the form of a share of the profits.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:27.472
$10 a month.

01:26:30.226 --> 01:26:34.104
I consider that quite a generous offer
under the circumstances.

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:38.609
Frankly, it's more than
I would have offered, had I the authority.

01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:44.448
COMSTOCK: Well, Stroud?

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.705
Let me see if I understand you.

01:26:52.832 --> 01:26:55.292
What you're proposing
is that the United States government

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:57.794
go into the canary bird business.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.256
That's against private enterprise.

01:27:01.674 --> 01:27:03.800
You sound like a Bolshevik, Harvey.

01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:06.178
COMSTOCK: You have no legal right
to raise canaries at all.

01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:07.304
I know.

01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:10.474
Rule 60 of
the Federal Bureau of Prisons Manual.

01:27:10.558 --> 01:27:12.893
"An inmate cannot be permitted
to operate a business,

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:15.187
"no matter how legitimate, while in prison."

01:27:15.271 --> 01:27:16.355
That right, Harvey?

01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:17.481
You quoted it correctly.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.441
That's what I thought.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.110
That's why I'm confused.

01:27:23.112 --> 01:27:25.447
The rule says I can't have a business.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:28.575
You say I can,
provided I give you the profits.

01:27:29.702 --> 01:27:31.495
That's circumventing regulations.

01:27:31.537 --> 01:27:33.163
It's not like you.

01:27:34.624 --> 01:27:36.416
Mr. Shoemaker came
all the way from Washington

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:39.670
to try to work out a plan
so you can keep your blasted birds.

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:42.130
Don't con an old con, Warden.

01:27:42.173 --> 01:27:45.092
He came here because of public opinion,
and you know it.

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:47.469
Fifty thousand signatures on a petition.

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:50.514
Congressmen jumping
all over Macleod's back.

01:27:54.185 --> 01:27:56.895
I think I got you over a barrel, Harvey.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:01.066
Is that your last word?

01:28:02.026 --> 01:28:05.362
I could use more room for my birds.

01:28:09.117 --> 01:28:12.744
I'll report the minutes of our conference
to, uh, Mr. Macleod.

That's all, Comstock.

Have a nice trip back to Washington.

I'm not going back to Washington.

01:28:33.182 --> 01:28:36.643
I'm heading a new penitentiary. Alcatraz.

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:19.644

into the next one.

01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.150
I can keep them, and I can sell them.

01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:28.278
I get larger quarters
and even some laboratory equipment.

Two women and a con,

01:29:34.619 --> 01:29:37.454
and we whipped the bureau to a standstill.

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:40.832
That's very good news, indeed.

01:29:41.918 --> 01:29:46.129
Of course, there was a time
when I would have been the first to know.

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:48.715
It's a real victory, Mother.

01:29:49.592 --> 01:29:52.010

Sit down, Robbie.

01:30:01.979 --> 01:30:04.147
I want to talk to you about her.

01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:05.357
About Stella?

01:30:05.441 --> 01:30:08.568
Your association with her
will bring you nothing but trouble.

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:13.156
I don't know what you mean.

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:15.867
I've thought from the first
she was the wrong kind of a woman

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:17.202
for you to align yourself with.

01:30:20.998 --> 01:30:23.291
She's worked her heart out for me.

01:30:23.334 --> 01:30:24.459
She saved my bacon.

01:30:24.502 --> 01:30:28.630
All right, she was of use temporarily,
but she's served her purpose.

01:30:28.798 --> 01:30:32.217
And now, if you'll follow my advice,
you'll get rid of her.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.684
I don't understand what you're...

01:30:40.768 --> 01:30:41.893
What you're talking about, Mom.

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:43.478
She's my wife.

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:48.942
Your trouble began with
that other woman in Alaska.

01:30:50.069 --> 01:30:52.446
She's the same kind of a woman.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:55.323
She's a common adventuress.

01:30:55.366 --> 01:30:57.868
Don't say things like that, Mother.

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:02.789
She's a good woman, and she's kind.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:06.543
She'd do anything in the world for me.

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.462
It's disaster, Robbie.

01:31:10.214 --> 01:31:12.924
She'll bring you nothing but heartache.

01:31:15.344 --> 01:31:18.180
Besides, all she wanted was the publicity.

01:31:21.684 --> 01:31:25.270

you wanted me here for all time

Then, you choose her
instead of your own mother?

Don't say any more, Mother.

was the lantern he had been waiting for

Now Stroud decided he was equipped

to launch a project
he had long dreamed about.

A definitive work on the diseases of birds.

01:39:53.612 --> 01:39:55.530
He had found cures for diseases,

01:39:55.572 --> 01:39:57.907
the names of which
he could hardly pronounce.

He even found a specific for fowl paralysis,

thereby saving poultry ranchers
the lives of thousands of chickens.

The title of his book was
Stroud's Digest of the Diseases of Birds.

that the aging prisoner

in his field.

It's a highly scientific study of pathology,

01:40:54.757 --> 01:40:56.591
diseases, of birds.

01:40:57.593 --> 01:41:00.470
You think Stroud's quite a man, don't you?

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:03.014
I think he's a genius.

01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:06.976
Why? Just because
he's written a book about birds?

01:41:07.936 --> 01:41:09.270
No, not because of that.

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:12.732
Because, with only a third-grade education,

01:41:13.692 --> 01:41:18.988
he's become expert
in subjects like hematology, blood,

01:41:20.324 --> 01:41:22.033
histology, tissue,

01:41:22.659 --> 01:41:23.868
anatomy.

01:41:25.162 --> 01:41:27.997
Studies tough enough
with an instructor in college,

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:29.832
but self-taught in a cell,

01:41:29.875 --> 01:41:32.502
an accomplishment
that simply staggers the imagination.

01:41:32.544 --> 01:41:34.712
He's smart. He has a high IQ.

01:41:36.465 --> 01:41:38.508
He's more than that. He's dedicated.

01:41:39.343 --> 01:41:42.512
He's spent over 3,000 hours
at that microscope of his.

01:41:42.596 --> 01:41:46.015
Made hundreds of drawings,
over 5,000 tissue sections.

01:41:47.184 --> 01:41:50.561
He has one of the finest collections
of slides on birds in existence.

01:41:50.646 --> 01:41:54.774
He knows more about avian anatomy
and pathology than any man alive.

01:41:55.859 --> 01:41:59.112
Okay, I'll recommend
his book go to the publishers.

01:41:59.488 --> 01:42:01.614
Make the bird lovers happy.

01:42:05.494 --> 01:42:08.704
If Stroud is paroled
and gets a proper laboratory,

01:42:08.747 --> 01:42:10.081
there's no telling
what he might come up with.

01:42:10.165 --> 01:42:13.167
He really should be working
on human diseases, not birds.

01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:16.504
Paroled? Not much chance of that.

01:42:18.382 --> 01:42:20.591
Oh, I thought his record was good.

01:42:21.051 --> 01:42:22.885
Not in the eyes of the bureau.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:24.887
His attitude is poor.

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:27.223
He thinks he's a world unto himself,

01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:30.601
like we were
his own personal quartermaster corps.

01:42:31.311 --> 01:42:35.022
Chemicals, laboratory equipment, birdseed.

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:38.943
Now he's demanding
25 pounds of ice every day.

01:42:39.027 --> 01:42:40.778
It's got to stop someplace.

01:42:40.863 --> 01:42:44.240
I'd give him 500 pounds of ice a day
if he wanted it.

01:42:44.741 --> 01:42:46.075
Oh, you would, huh?

01:42:47.703 --> 01:42:50.621
I wonder if the bureau isn't afraid of Stroud.

01:42:50.706 --> 01:42:52.915
Afraid to let the public know
what kind of a brain

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:54.917
they're keeping locked up here.

01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.087
Doctor, we're keeping
a killer locked up here.

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.047
Don't forget it.

01:43:01.091 --> 01:43:04.635
I heard from that professor,
the one at the University of Kansas.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:08.598
He said if I were out, I might have
a good chance to get a research grant.

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:09.765
What's that?

01:43:09.808 --> 01:43:11.934
Well, they pay you to do research.

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:14.478
Bob, that's wonderful.

01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:17.023
Only one drawback, getting out.

01:43:17.774 --> 01:43:20.943
How can the parole board
turn you down now?

01:43:21.445 --> 01:43:23.154
Why, they talk about rehabilitation.

01:43:23.238 --> 01:43:25.823
This book and the cures you discovered.

01:43:25.908 --> 01:43:27.617
What do they want?

01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:30.536
I wish you were on that board, Stell.

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:33.164
I'd be strolling down the avenue right now.

01:43:33.248 --> 01:43:34.832
But let's not make any plans.

01:43:34.917 --> 01:43:37.752
I've seen too many of them go up in smoke.

01:43:38.128 --> 01:43:41.839
You still won't let yourself think
about getting out, will you?

01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:44.926
Bob, what's wrong with having a little faith?

01:43:48.805 --> 01:43:51.390
You're always bringing me new words.

01:43:52.643 --> 01:43:54.143
"Love" and "faith."

01:43:54.853 --> 01:43:56.646
You're a wonderful man.

01:43:56.688 --> 01:43:58.814
You've done some great things.

01:43:58.857 --> 01:44:02.652
I have faith that the parole board
will see how good you are.

01:44:03.028 --> 01:44:07.782
Golly, you just can't go on thinking that
you're gonna be here the rest of your life.

01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:22.755
All right, honey.

01:44:22.839 --> 01:44:26.092
I'll bring faith into my cell tonight,
entertain it,

01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:29.220
just for the soup course.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:35.142

any new neckties yet, okay?

01:44:36.979 --> 01:44:38.813
You look pretty today.

01:44:59.042 --> 01:45:01.127
Bob, come on, wake up.

01:45:01.211 --> 01:45:03.379
Bob, wake up. Come on. Get up.

01:45:04.047 --> 01:45:05.673

01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:39.290

Orders. Step on it.

01:46:14.284 --> 01:46:17.370
What about my equipment, my birds?

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:21.624
Our instructions are you walk out of here
with just the clothes you have on.

01:46:26.296 --> 01:46:29.548
I got a sick bird in there. Can I fix him?

01:46:31.009 --> 01:46:32.676
Of course you can.

01:46:51.113 --> 01:46:52.905
Listen to me, Bull.

01:46:58.203 --> 01:47:00.413
I want you to talk to Stella.

01:47:04.501 --> 01:47:07.253
I want you to tell her not to follow me.

Solitary again, hmm?

01:49:53.253 --> 01:49:56.171
Not called solitary here. Segregation.

01:49:58.341 --> 01:50:00.009
Interesting name.

01:50:15.859 --> 01:50:18.569
- Silence rule?
- Strictly enforced.

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.499
Hello, Bob.

01:50:35.337 --> 01:50:37.171
How are you, Harvey?

01:50:37.213 --> 01:50:39.340
Pretty good for an old man.

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.717
You're looking well.

01:50:45.555 --> 01:50:48.724
How was your trip out?
Not too unpleasant, I hope?

01:50:49.392 --> 01:50:51.602
Well, I've always enjoyed traveling.

01:50:54.105 --> 01:50:57.066
It's quite an establishment you've got here.

01:50:57.734 --> 01:50:59.902
Yes, it has its good points.

Yeah, you'll find no cockroaches here.

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:20.506
We have linoleum
on all the floors of the cells.

01:51:21.091 --> 01:51:24.593
Coming over on the launch,
I saw some children playing.

They belong to the guards
and all the other personnel.

I got a good report on you
from Leavenworth, Bob.

And I'm satisfied
you'll make the adjustment here.

eventually we can improve on that.

Well, I don't suppose any of us
truly enjoy living on this island.

- Still squeaking by.

- Time?
- Yeah. How much time, altogether?

01:55:36.179 --> 01:55:37.554
I don't know.

01:55:38.348 --> 01:55:40.015

01:55:42.393 --> 01:55:45.354
I knocked off four at Atlanta.

01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:48.315
I did three at Joliet.

01:55:49.233 --> 01:55:52.694
Then I did that ten-spot with you
at Leavenworth.

01:55:52.737 --> 01:55:55.530
And then I was on the street for four.

01:55:55.573 --> 01:55:57.240
And then I been here for six.

01:55:58.368 --> 01:55:59.618
How much is that?

01:55:59.702 --> 01:56:00.994
Twenty-three.

01:56:01.162 --> 01:56:02.496
Yeah.

Why do you want to know, Bob?

01:56:05.875 --> 01:56:07.709
Nothing. I just wondered.

01:56:09.045 --> 01:56:10.379
Nothing, sir.

just wanted some more meat.

you understand?

of your book on bird diseases.

That's all behind me now.

I've started writing a new book.

01:56:59.387 --> 01:57:03.765
The history of federal prisons from 1790
up to the formation of the Bureau.

01:57:04.058 --> 01:57:06.935
It's gonna be a story about caged men
rather than birds.

01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.479
What prison does to them.

01:57:09.564 --> 01:57:12.357
I got the idea from seeing an old friend.

01:57:13.776 --> 01:57:15.444
It's an ambitious undertaking, Bob.

All the elements of a bestseller, eh, Father?

01:57:28.124 --> 01:57:29.791
It's a story that needs telling.

01:57:29.834 --> 01:57:31.460
And how.

01:57:31.502 --> 01:57:32.961
You...

01:57:33.004 --> 01:57:36.590
You realize, of course,
it involves a certain element of risk?

01:57:38.009 --> 01:57:39.968
I do, indeed.

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:41.970
But you know something?

01:57:43.598 --> 01:57:47.684
When you've lived in these manure piles
for over 30 years, as I have,

01:57:47.769 --> 01:57:50.353
you come to know everything's a risk.

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:52.397
Your serve.

01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:58.820
- I wish you luck.
- It's worth the gamble.

01:58:43.157 --> 01:58:45.784
I'm confiscating this manuscript, Bob.

01:58:46.828 --> 01:58:48.370
Have you read it?

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:52.374
Enough to realize that it's a blast
at the entire penal system.

01:58:53.543 --> 01:58:55.585
You're in serious trouble.

01:58:56.629 --> 01:59:00.048
The Bureau has known for months
what you were writing.

01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:03.343
You haven't told me what you think of it.

01:59:09.142 --> 01:59:11.143
I resent this personally.

01:59:13.187 --> 01:59:16.064
I stand high in my profession,

01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:18.859
and I believe I've earned that esteem.

01:59:18.901 --> 01:59:22.237
I am proud of the advances
that I have helped to inaugurate.

01:59:22.321 --> 01:59:24.197
Now, you think back to the old times.

01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:27.742
Leg irons, carrying the iron ball, stripes,
corporal punishment,

01:59:27.827 --> 01:59:30.287
indefinite periods in the hole.

01:59:30.371 --> 01:59:33.290
Well, I have been instrumental
in abolishing that kind of treatment.

01:59:33.374 --> 01:59:35.375
Yes, that's true, Harvey.

01:59:36.294 --> 01:59:38.962
Furthermore,
you completely ignore my fight

01:59:39.046 --> 01:59:41.381
for a constructive work program.

01:59:42.216 --> 01:59:43.842
Like making belt buckles?

01:59:44.552 --> 01:59:46.553
Or running a drill press?

01:59:48.097 --> 01:59:49.264
Oh, I see.

01:59:50.224 --> 01:59:53.810
My entire career has been for nothing.
I'm all wrong, and you're all right.

01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:58.899
I'm not talking about one tree, Harvey.

01:59:59.275 --> 02:00:01.276
I'm talking about the whole forest.

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:04.613
I haven't spent most of my life
behind bars for nothing.

02:00:04.697 --> 02:00:06.740
I've reached a few conclusions
about penology,

02:00:06.782 --> 02:00:08.200
and a couple of them may be valid.

02:00:12.205 --> 02:00:15.582
When you first came here,
I thought you were changed.

02:00:18.294 --> 02:00:22.380
I was even planning to return you
to the general prison population.

02:00:24.926 --> 02:00:26.468
And now this.

02:00:27.053 --> 02:00:29.554
Well, you're not going to get away with it.

02:00:29.639 --> 02:00:32.140
The Bureau has suggested
that all your privileges be suspended.

02:00:32.225 --> 02:00:35.101
And you know what that means here.

02:00:35.144 --> 02:00:37.646
You know better than to
try to frighten me, Harvey,

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:39.481
at this late date.

02:00:39.523 --> 02:00:41.274
Damn your heart!

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:46.321
Do you think that
I want to go on punishing you?

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:48.490
We've grown old together in penitentiaries!

02:00:48.532 --> 02:00:52.160
And in all that time, I've only asked
one thing from you. Cooperation.

02:00:52.203 --> 02:00:54.412
The only thing I've ever gotten back
was defiance!

02:00:54.497 --> 02:00:57.999
Not once have you ever shown
a sign of rehabilitation!

02:01:11.639 --> 02:01:14.683
- Rehabilitation?
- Yes, rehabilitation.

02:01:14.725 --> 02:01:17.519
I wonder if you know what the word means.

02:01:19.063 --> 02:01:20.272
Do you?

02:01:21.357 --> 02:01:23.108
Don't be insulting.

02:01:27.738 --> 02:01:31.032
The unabridged
Webster's International Dictionary

02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:34.494
says it comes from the Latin root habilis.

02:01:34.578 --> 02:01:36.705
The definition is,

02:01:36.831 --> 02:01:39.708
"To invest again with dignity."

02:01:39.792 --> 02:01:42.210
You consider that part of your job, Harvey?

02:01:42.295 --> 02:01:45.130
To give a man back the dignity he once had?

02:01:46.465 --> 02:01:49.009
Your only interest is in how he behaves.

02:01:49.051 --> 02:01:52.971
You told me that once a long time ago,
and I'll never forget it.

02:01:53.389 --> 02:01:57.017
"You'll conform to our ideas
of how you should behave."

02:01:57.768 --> 02:02:01.479
And you haven't retreated
from that stand one inch in 35 years.

02:02:02.648 --> 02:02:06.276
You want your prisoners to
dance out the gates like puppets on a string.

02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:09.362
With rubber-stamp values
impressed by you.

02:02:09.905 --> 02:02:14.159
With your sense of conformity,
your sense of behavior,

02:02:14.243 --> 02:02:16.369
even your sense of morality.

02:02:18.247 --> 02:02:20.790
That's why you're a failure, Harvey.

02:02:21.083 --> 02:02:23.752
You and the whole science of penology.

02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:27.964
Because you rob prisoners
of the most important thing in their lives,

02:02:28.424 --> 02:02:30.216
their individuality.

02:02:31.802 --> 02:02:34.262
On the outside, they're lost automatons,

02:02:34.305 --> 02:02:36.806
just going through the motions of living.

02:02:36.891 --> 02:02:40.769
But underneath is a deep,
deep hatred for what you did to them.

02:02:42.104 --> 02:02:45.398
First chance they get to attack society,
they do it.

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:49.235
The result?
More than half come back to prison.

02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:54.949
Now, it's all here in my book.

02:02:55.284 --> 02:02:58.453
And I suggest you read it,
and you read it thoroughly!

02:03:02.875 --> 02:03:05.418
All right, you've spoken your piece.

02:03:09.757 --> 02:03:11.841
I have no course left but to speak mine.

02:03:19.141 --> 02:03:23.645
This San Francisco climate sure doesn't
help an old man's aches and pains.

02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:27.273
Where does it hurt you, Harvey?

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:31.277
In my left shoulder and down my arm.

02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:34.989
You should have a medical checkup.

02:03:35.032 --> 02:03:36.408

Bob, I could get on your visiting list.

I could get a job in Oakland maybe,

02:05:36.612 --> 02:05:38.738
and I could get a room at the waterfront,

02:05:38.781 --> 02:05:42.200
and you could get some spyglasses
and see my room from your cell.

02:05:42.284 --> 02:05:44.202

02:05:44.286 --> 02:05:45.995

Just to see me once a month?

I'm never gonna get out of here.

02:06:19.655 --> 02:06:21.739
I could get a job in a factory or something.

02:06:21.824 --> 02:06:24.325
I could write letters every day.
It would be like old times.

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:27.036
You'd wither away and die waiting.

02:06:27.121 --> 02:06:28.830

Listen carefully.

was finally allowed to leave the Rock.
