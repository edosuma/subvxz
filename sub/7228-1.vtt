[Doc reading]

01:10.403 --> 01:11.237
Hi, everyone.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.530
[all] Hi, Doc!

01:13.865 --> 01:16.034
Oh!
Are we playing princess?

01:16.117 --> 01:16.951
Yep.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.663
Baa-utiful!
Hoo-hoo!

01:21.247 --> 01:23.917
Once upon a time,
in McStuffins Kingdom,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.795
Princess Lambie was trapped
in the tower of her castle!

01:26.878 --> 01:30.381
[gasps] Help! Help!
I'm trapped!

01:30.715 --> 01:33.927
We need a brave prince
to rescue the princess.

01:34.385 --> 01:35.720
Here I come!

01:36.095 --> 01:38.389
Uh! Huh!
Brave prince to the...

01:38.473 --> 01:39.849
Whoa!
[grunts]

01:40.934 --> 01:42.143
...rescue!

01:42.393 --> 01:44.604
[chuckles]
I gotcha, sugar.

01:44.687 --> 01:48.149
[sighs] Doc, wouldn't it be
princess-perfect

01:48.233 --> 01:51.402
if we had a real prince
to save me for once?

01:52.403 --> 01:56.574
Or... [gasps] Ooh!
A knight in shining armor!

01:57.033 --> 01:58.284
We could use a knight.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.202
A knight?

01:59.285 --> 02:01.204
Then what do I get to be?

02:01.746 --> 02:05.375
Well, you could be...
the scary dragon!

02:05.458 --> 02:06.459
Okay!

02:06.543 --> 02:08.419
I can make a great dragon!

02:10.295 --> 02:12.132
What?
[all laughing]

02:12.215 --> 02:15.093
Stuffy, you <span style="style.default_1">are</span> a dragon!

02:15.677 --> 02:18.346
Oh. [chuckles]
Yeah. I knew that.

02:18.429 --> 02:21.057
Great, now that we know
who'll play the dragon,

02:21.141 --> 02:23.059
what about the brave knight?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.811
Where can we rustle him up, Doc?

02:24.894 --> 02:28.481
Hmmm... Donny used to have
a toy knight that he played
with all the time.

02:28.815 --> 02:33.695
I remember that knight.
He was really brave!

02:33.778 --> 02:34.988
Shiny, too.

02:35.071 --> 02:40.326
Oh! A brave, shiny knight
all dressed up in armor?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.996
Oh, I sure like
the sound of that.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.207
Can we play with him, Doc?
Can we, can we, can we, please?

02:46.291 --> 02:49.794
It would make Princess Lambie
royally happy.

02:51.170 --> 02:53.631
Let me see if Donny
will let me borrow him.

02:54.716 --> 02:55.800
Thanks, Donny!

03:04.017 --> 03:06.185
Where's my little knighty-poo?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.813
Hey, he's <span style="style.default_1">my</span> knighty-poo!

03:10.440 --> 03:11.274
[all gasp]

03:17.196 --> 03:18.364
[Lambie and Hallie exclaim]

03:18.656 --> 03:21.284
It is I, Sir Kirby!

03:23.912 --> 03:26.998
The bravest knight
in all of McStuffins's Kingdom.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.875
Everyone say hi to Sir Kirby.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.127
-Hello.
-Hi...

03:31.210 --> 03:33.963
[chuckles]
Enchanted, I'm sure.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.424
Didn't you say
he was shiny?

03:36.841 --> 03:38.384
Uh, he <span style="style.default_1">was.</span>

03:38.468 --> 03:40.470
How may I serve you?

03:40.845 --> 03:44.682
Oh, um, right.
There's a scary dragon!

03:46.517 --> 03:49.145
Ahem!
Scary dragon!

03:49.479 --> 03:52.065
Oh, yeah.
Roar!

03:52.148 --> 03:53.691
Do not fear, princess!

03:53.775 --> 03:54.734
For I come to--

03:55.235 --> 03:56.236
Whoa!

03:57.111 --> 03:58.112
Oh, dear.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.365
Oh, Sir Kirby,
are you okay?

04:00.740 --> 04:01.866
What? Me?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.201
Why, of course!

04:03.451 --> 04:05.536
Why would you think
I wasn't okay?

04:05.787 --> 04:09.874
Well, you don't look
exactly the way
I remembered you looking.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.461
We thought you were gonna be
a lot shinier, Sir Kirby.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.838
'Tis true,
beautiful princess.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.632
Alas, my armor
has seen shinier days.

04:18.716 --> 04:22.470
However, I am still
a brave knight!

04:23.972 --> 04:25.139
Oh!

04:25.223 --> 04:28.017
Oh, my.
Fear not, princess!

04:28.101 --> 04:30.895
I will leap up the tower
to your rescue!

04:30.979 --> 04:31.813
[shouts]

04:31.896 --> 04:32.981
[all gasp]

04:35.358 --> 04:36.192
Thank you.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.946
Sir Kirby, you don't seem
as knightly as you used to.

04:40.029 --> 04:41.489
I think there's
something wrong.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.575
Ah, you may be right,
Lady McStuffins.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.577
I've always been
a great knight,

04:46.661 --> 04:50.248
but my legs and arms
don't seem to be working
quite the way they used to.

04:50.331 --> 04:54.794
And I cannot fulfill
my sworn duty to, um,
protect the princess.

04:55.211 --> 04:58.339
Sir Kirby, you're still
a great knight. You just--

04:58.423 --> 05:00.508
Oh, um, oops.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.845
I think I'm stuck to you,
or you're stuck to me!

05:03.928 --> 05:04.887
Sorry!

05:04.971 --> 05:07.223
Ew, ew, ew... ooh.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.019
I fear that my best days
are behind me.

05:11.102 --> 05:15.815
For there is no use
for a knight who cannot leap
to the rescue.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.984
Sir Kirby, you know how
you're really great

05:18.067 --> 05:19.444
at saving princesses?

05:19.527 --> 05:22.071
Well, I'm really great
at saving toys!

05:22.155 --> 05:25.074
I promise that I'm going to
figure out what's wrong with you

05:25.158 --> 05:26.367
and make you better!

05:26.451 --> 05:27.410
Really?

05:27.744 --> 05:29.245
The Doc is in!

05:29.662 --> 05:30.496
[Sir Kirby gasps]

05:32.123 --> 05:36.836
What are those
extremely shiny things,
and whatever are they used for?

05:37.211 --> 05:38.796
Don't worry, Sir Kirby.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.841
These are the tools I use
to help my patients
feel better.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.968
Right then. Splendid!

05:44.469 --> 05:46.054
And very good, too!

05:46.471 --> 05:48.431
First, let me check
your heartbeat.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.725
[thump thump]

05:51.142 --> 05:54.020
'Tis good to know
my heart still beats true.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.231
Oops, sorry.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.486
Next, let's measure
your height against
this wall here.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.737
With pleasure!

06:03.112 --> 06:05.198
A true knight
always stands tall.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.577
Thank you, Sir Kirby.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.955
Now come over to my
doctor's bag, and I'll check
your blood pressure.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.665
With pleasure!

06:16.125 --> 06:17.376
Sir Kirby?

06:17.460 --> 06:18.503
Are you coming?

06:19.545 --> 06:20.755
Oh, for the love of--

06:20.838 --> 06:21.839
I am trying.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.550
[yelps]
A little help, perhaps.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.846
[straining]

06:28.930 --> 06:31.516
-Careful. Oh.
-Uh... Uh...

06:31.599 --> 06:32.433
Whoa!

06:33.643 --> 06:35.686
Oh. I'm okay.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.147
I'm not okay.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.775
Why don't you just
stay there for a second?

06:41.150 --> 06:44.529
Hmm, good idea, for I don't
seem to have a choice.

06:45.029 --> 06:46.447
I am stuck!

06:46.531 --> 06:49.408
You seem to be sticking
to everything, Sir Kirby.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.160
I need to find out why.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.872
Hmm, that's something
I've never seen before!

06:54.956 --> 06:56.415
What? What is it?

06:56.791 --> 06:59.710
Was my armor burned by a scary,
fire-breathing dragon?

06:59.961 --> 07:02.588
Or better still, zapped
by the spell of a wicked witch?

07:03.047 --> 07:04.590
No, not that.

07:04.674 --> 07:10.263
It kind of looks like
you're covered in grape jelly
and pizza cheese.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.306
Yum!

07:13.724 --> 07:14.600
[sniffs]

07:14.684 --> 07:17.061
Yep. That's what
it is, all right.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.691
Sir Kirby, when was
the last time you took a bath?

07:21.774 --> 07:23.234
Oh, let me see.

07:23.317 --> 07:26.737
I think it was, um...
It must have been, uh...

07:26.821 --> 07:28.239
Carry the two...

07:28.614 --> 07:32.368
Well, to tell you the truth,
I don't think
I've ever taken a bath.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.245
Oh, my!

07:34.328 --> 07:38.499
Sir Kirby, I think
I know why you can't move
your arms and legs very well.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.667
Do tell!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.878
I have a diagnosis!

07:41.961 --> 07:45.256
Sir Kirby has...
filthy-icky-sticky disease!

07:45.339 --> 07:46.340
[all gasp]

07:46.424 --> 07:50.052
Looks like we've got
another entry for
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos!</span>

07:50.386 --> 07:53.264
Lady McStuffins, please tell me
what this means.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.059
I will... try to be brave.

07:57.143 --> 08:01.397
Well, you're covered
with sticky foods,
so you're stuck together.

08:01.481 --> 08:06.986
Filthy-icky-sticky disease
means that you, Sir Kirby,
are not clean.

08:07.069 --> 08:08.154
Ohhhh!

08:09.113 --> 08:11.199
An unclean knight
will never do!

08:11.282 --> 08:13.534
Princess, I beg you, forgive me.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.871
I shall hand in my armor,
and I shall go.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.334
But Sir Kirby, you don't
have to stop being a knight.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.794
We can make you all better!
How?

08:24.253 --> 08:27.632
We treat filthy-icky-sticky
disease by taking a bath

08:27.715 --> 08:29.717
and getting squeaky clean!

08:29.800 --> 08:31.010
A bath?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.221
Nothing to worry about, sugar.

08:33.304 --> 08:36.224
Bath time is a rootin-tootin'

10:08.983 --> 10:10.151
How's Sir Kirby?

Hey there, good lookin'!

10:28.210 --> 10:33.007
Thanks to you, Lady McStuffins,
I feel like myself again.

You're welcome, Sir Kirby.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.284
I feel as though I could hop
onto my trusty steed,

11:00.368 --> 11:04.872
battle a scary dragon,
and save a fair princess.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.791
[gasps] That's me!
I'm the princess!

11:06.874 --> 11:09.085
[fanfare]

11:09.168 --> 11:12.505
[Doc] Once upon a time,
in McStuffins's Kingdom,

11:12.588 --> 11:14.298
there was a princess...

11:14.382 --> 11:19.678
Oh! There are dangerous
and scary dragons everywhere!

11:20.679 --> 11:23.682
[growls]
I'm a scary dragon!

11:23.766 --> 11:24.683
Roar!

11:25.434 --> 11:30.856
But luckily, there was someone
very brave and clean
who could come to her rescue.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.651
Fear not, fair princess!

11:33.734 --> 11:38.155
For I shall protect you
from the mighty
and terrifying dragon!

11:44.870 --> 11:46.705
Away, dragon, away!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.376
Roar!

11:50.459 --> 11:52.628
Whoa! Dragon!

11:52.711 --> 11:53.629
[laughs]

11:53.712 --> 11:58.384
Oh, Sir Kirby,
you're so brave!

11:58.467 --> 12:04.390
All in a day's work
for the cleanest knight in all
of McStuffins's Kingdom!

12:04.682 --> 12:09.437
And they all lived happily
ever after... and took
lots of baths!

12:09.520 --> 12:13.357

12:15.109 --> 12:17.278

-Bop him!

12:20.114 --> 12:23.200
Bop him! Bop him!

12:23.284 --> 12:24.577
Bop him!

12:24.660 --> 12:27.288
He won't stay down!
[giggles]

12:28.747 --> 12:30.958
Hey, Donny!
Hi, Will!
[laughs]

12:31.041 --> 12:32.168
Hi, Doc.
Hi, Doc.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.752
What are you guys doing?

12:33.836 --> 12:36.088
Playing with Boppy!

12:36.172 --> 12:38.257
No matter how hard
you bop him...

12:38.924 --> 12:41.510
he always pops
back up again. See?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.053
Ooh, let me try.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.598
You're not gonna
be able to do it.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.308
He won't stay down.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.979
Stay down!
Stay down!

12:52.897 --> 12:53.981
Hey!

12:55.316 --> 12:57.610
See, I told you
you couldn't do it.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.278
I guess you were right.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.113
Even I can't keep him down.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.948
This time
I'm gonna do it!

13:03.032 --> 13:05.951
No way.
Bop him! Bop him!

13:09.413 --> 13:11.540
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Doc! Come here.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.210
Look at these new flowers
popping up in the garden.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.712
Those are the daisies
you helped me plant.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.089
And these roses are getting
ready to open up.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.799
-Ow!
-Dad, are you okay?

13:20.883 --> 13:21.967
Oh, of course, sweetie.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.969
I just pricked my finger
on a thorn.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.513
Here, let me take a look.

13:26.555 --> 13:27.681
Don't worry, Dad.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.308
The doctor is in.

13:29.391 --> 13:32.061
I sure do like a doctor
who makes house calls...

13:32.436 --> 13:33.854
Garden calls, too!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.233
First, I have to
clean your cut.

13:46.450 --> 13:48.077
Now, I'll put on a bandage.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.041
Thanks, Doc.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.376
You do good work!

13:56.126 --> 13:57.920
Dad, it's not done yet!

13:58.003 --> 13:59.421
You need one more
thing.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.676
-There.
-Now, that's perfect!

14:03.759 --> 14:05.469
Thanks, Doc.
Sure, Dad.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.597
Just keep that clean,
and come get me
if it isn't feeling better.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.268
Great. What do I owe you
for the doctor's visit?

14:12.351 --> 14:16.272
Hmm, that'll cost you...
one hug.

14:16.355 --> 14:21.151
Oh, you run a hard
bargain, but I think
I can afford that.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.280
Mmm.
Mmm. Ahh.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.658
Bye, Dad!

14:30.369 --> 14:32.079
The Doc is in!

14:39.420 --> 14:40.629
Hi, everyone!

Hi, Chilly!

14:45.843 --> 14:46.927
What's wrong?

14:47.219 --> 14:49.179
Oh it's awful!
Look at me!

14:49.263 --> 14:50.848
I'm white as a sheet!

14:51.348 --> 14:53.183
Chilly, you're a snowman.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.019
You're supposed
to be white.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.021
We tried to tell him!

14:57.104 --> 14:58.814
Hoo! Thanks, Doc!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.942
I don't know how you always
have the answers, but you do!

15:02.026 --> 15:03.694
[Donny and Will]
Doc! Doc!

15:03.777 --> 15:05.487
Sounds like someone
else needs you, Doc.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.365
Doc! Help!

15:08.991 --> 15:10.326
It's Will and Donny.

15:10.409 --> 15:11.827
And they're coming this way.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.579
Toys, go stuffed!

15:17.333 --> 15:18.375
You got it, Doc.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.461
Stuffy!
You're moving.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.463
Oh, right. Got it.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.465
Not moving.
Starting now.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.012
Donny! Will!
What's wrong?

15:30.262 --> 15:32.890
Doc, it's Boppy!
[air hissing]

15:32.973 --> 15:34.308
You gotta save him!

15:34.391 --> 15:36.769
He's got a hole
and he's losing air!

15:36.852 --> 15:40.189
If you bop him,
he doesn't even pop back up!

15:40.606 --> 15:41.982
That sounds serious.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.653
But if you let me examine him,
I'll do everything I can
to fix him.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.034
What do we got, Doc?

15:52.117 --> 15:54.870
Looks like we have an emergency!

15:55.120 --> 15:57.414
It's an emergency!
It's an emergency!

15:57.498 --> 15:59.041
Chilly, it's okay!

15:59.124 --> 16:01.710
Doc's great in an
emergency, remember?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.295
Oh, yeah!

16:03.712 --> 16:05.464
She's great at everything.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.096
He's coming around.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.683
Huh?
Whoa, where am I?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.893
You're in the
doctor's office.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.520
How are you feeling?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.522
Oh, not so good!

16:21.605 --> 16:23.232
I'm a little light-headed.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.566
Whoa!

16:24.650 --> 16:25.776
[Hallie] Oh, my!

16:26.443 --> 16:28.404
-Buh?
-He didn't pop back up.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.905
That's not like him!

16:29.989 --> 16:32.783
Oh, I need a cuddle!

16:33.701 --> 16:34.994
Magnifying glass, Hallie.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.495
Comin' right up!

16:37.579 --> 16:38.539
Oh... Whop.

16:38.622 --> 16:39.832
Just try to relax, Boppy.

16:39.915 --> 16:42.001
I'm going to use this
to find the hole.

16:42.084 --> 16:46.922
Just tell it to me straight,
Doc. It's bad, isn't it?

16:47.006 --> 16:48.382
Lie back, sugar.

16:48.465 --> 16:51.343
You're in the hands
of the best toy doctor
I've ever seen.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.262
She's gonna take
great care of you!

16:54.471 --> 16:55.931
I have to find the leak...

16:56.015 --> 16:56.974
Fast!

16:58.684 --> 16:59.560
That's it!

16:59.935 --> 17:01.353
That's where the hole is!

17:01.645 --> 17:04.022
Stuffy, I need you to
put pressure right here!

17:04.106 --> 17:05.065
Okay.

Whaah!

17:13.824 --> 17:15.075
[hissing stops]

17:16.285 --> 17:18.579
Now, Boppy, just hold still.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.082
I'm not going
anywhere, Doc!

17:23.666 --> 17:24.585
Phew!

17:25.544 --> 17:26.377
Phew.

17:26.627 --> 17:32.426
I'm still a little woozy,
but, you know,
I'm feeling better already!

17:32.676 --> 17:33.510
Good.

17:33.594 --> 17:37.639
I'll just pump you up,
and you should feel even more
like your old self.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.977
Ooh! Waah!

17:42.061 --> 17:44.438
Oh, that feels
fantastic!

17:45.272 --> 17:46.523
You're all pumped up!

17:46.857 --> 17:50.819
Thanks, Doc, I'm ready
to get back to playtime!

17:51.070 --> 17:52.404
But we're not done yet.

give me your best bop!

Hmm.
I'd rather cuddle!

I was so lucky to be in
the backyard of the
great Doc McStuffins!

19:01.723 --> 19:03.433
Like, how lucky
can you get, right?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.518
Now, come on!

19:04.977 --> 19:07.521
Who'll give me
a good test run?

19:07.604 --> 19:08.856
Oh, I will! I will!

19:09.106 --> 19:13.652
But I am a dragon,
so let me know if you want me
to take it easy on you.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.789
Doc, nice work.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.624
Aw, thanks, Lambie.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.626
I couldn't have done it
without you guys!

19:29.710 --> 19:31.211
[air hissing]

19:31.295 --> 19:34.339
Oh, no! That sounds like Boppy
sprung a leak again!

19:34.423 --> 19:37.092
Doc, I don't know
how it happened,
but I bopped Boppy,

19:37.176 --> 19:38.844
and now he has a new hole!

19:39.219 --> 19:42.347

but I didn't think
I was that strong!

Here we go again. Oh!

19:59.907 --> 20:01.366
Oh, yeah,
I've still got it.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.577
Phew!
That was a close one!

20:03.827 --> 20:06.121
Yeah. Another close one.

20:06.955 --> 20:10.292
You know, a doctor's job
isn't just to help you
after you're hurt.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.044
It isn't?
[Doc] Nope.

20:12.419 --> 20:16.006
A doctor is also supposed
to help you not get hurt
in the first place!

20:16.506 --> 20:19.426
Boppy, I want to know why
you keep springing leaks!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.303
You're not the only one.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.013
I'd like to
know that, too!

20:23.388 --> 20:28.435
Boppy, Stuffy, show me
exactly what happened right
before Boppy started hissing.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.355
I bopped you there!

20:31.438 --> 20:32.981
And I popped up there.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.483
And bopped you there.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.484
Popped up there!

20:35.567 --> 20:37.361
And then I bopped
you over there.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.112
And then I bopped one there!

20:39.196 --> 20:42.115
Then you came back
and I was like whoa!
And then bop!

20:42.199 --> 20:43.408
And I came back up.

20:43.909 --> 20:47.120
Did you bop over here
by the rose bushes?

20:47.204 --> 20:49.665
Um...
Yeah, yeah, we did!

20:49.748 --> 20:52.167
'Course, I popped back up.
I always do!

20:52.251 --> 20:58.257
And-- But come to think of it,
this is where I started hissing.
Hissing...

21:00.175 --> 21:01.718
[gasps]
Look, she's got it!

21:01.802 --> 21:03.011
Doc's got it!

21:03.428 --> 21:04.513
I do.

21:04.596 --> 21:06.014
I have a diagnosis!

21:06.598 --> 21:08.517
That means she knows
what's wrong with you.

21:09.017 --> 21:12.187
Boppy, you've got a bad case
of the pricklethorns!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.313
Buh?

21:13.397 --> 21:15.190
Let's put that
diagnosis right here,

21:15.274 --> 21:17.442
in <span style="style.default_1">The Big Book</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of Boo-boos!</span>

21:20.779 --> 21:22.781
Oh, what are
the pricklethorns?

21:23.782 --> 21:27.286
The pricklethorns are when you
prick yourself on a thorn
or something sharp.

21:27.369 --> 21:28.996
Like my dad did
this morning!

21:29.871 --> 21:31.331
See this rose bush here?

21:31.707 --> 21:32.916
It has thorns.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.837
When you got near it,
you pricked yourself
and got a hole!

21:37.296 --> 21:41.550
Wow! Yeah, well, how do I
make sure I don't get
the pricklethorns again?

21:41.842 --> 21:45.846
That's simple. You just have
to stay away from thorns
and sharp things!

21:46.847 --> 21:48.765
One, two-- One, two, three!

Whoo, believe me, I'll always
be careful of sharp things now.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.896
Can't thank you
enough, Doc.

22:35.979 --> 22:38.273
I feel like my old self.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.357
[Donny] Doc!

22:41.359 --> 22:42.861
Toys! Go stuffed!

22:45.363 --> 22:46.782
Did you fix Boppy?

22:47.115 --> 22:49.284
Yep, he's all fixed.

22:49.367 --> 22:50.786
-Yes!
-All right!

22:50.869 --> 22:54.039
But you might want to play
with him someplace away
from the rose bush.

22:54.372 --> 22:55.457
Why?

22:55.540 --> 22:57.959
Because roses have thorns
that can pop him.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.587
I think that's how he got
his hole in the first place.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.464
Oh, yeah.

23:02.881 --> 23:05.092
Okay, we'll play with him
over here.

23:06.384 --> 23:08.303
Bop him, Will! Bop him!

23:08.386 --> 23:09.262
Bop him.

23:10.388 --> 23:12.182
Way to go, Boppy.

23:12.265 --> 23:13.350
Look at him bounce.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.684
Yeah, bop him.

23:14.768 --> 23:15.685
Stuffy!

23:15.769 --> 23:18.188
Right.
Being quiet now.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.150
Thanks, Doc!
You're awesome!

23:22.442 --> 23:24.277
The awesomest!

23:24.361 --> 23:25.987
Just doing my job.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.948
Bop him, Will!

23:28.031 --> 23:30.700
Bop him! Bop him!

23:32.828 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody,
it's Doc here.

23:34.913 --> 23:39.417
<span style="style.default_1">When you're out playing</span>
<span style="style.default_1">on a really hot day,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">what should you remember to do?</span>

23:40.377 --> 23:42.212
<span style="style.default_1">Should you give a Boppy a hug?</span>

23:45.423 --> 23:47.217
<span style="style.default_1">Should you trumpet</span>
<span style="style.default_1">like an elephant?</span>

23:47.300 --> 23:48.802
[plays note]

23:49.052 --> 23:51.263
<span style="style.default_1">Or should you drink</span>
<span style="style.default_1">plenty of water?</span>

23:52.097 --> 23:55.725
<span style="style.default_1">That's right. On a hot day,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">drink lots of water.</span>
