Titans! Today is the first
Monday in September,

00:28.829 --> 00:31.199
and you know what that means.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.804
Labor Day!

00:36.837 --> 00:38.339
Three-day weekend, yo!

00:38.372 --> 00:40.241
All right!

00:41.809 --> 00:42.843
I like days off.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.112
Yay!

00:44.145 --> 00:45.279
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:45.313 --> 00:47.181
Labor Day isn't just a day off.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.151
It's a day to appreciate labor.

00:50.184 --> 00:53.421
Yo, nobody respects what them pregnant
ladies go through more than me.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.189
I'm not talking
about pregnant ladies.

00:55.223 --> 00:57.358
I'm talking about the hard work

00:57.391 --> 01:01.195
that goes into the creation of nearly
everything that you probably take for granted.

01:01.229 --> 01:04.198
- Like what?
- Like, uh, this shirt, for instance.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.634
Think about how much work
it took to make it.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.570
To simply get the cotton,
a farmer had to build a farm,

01:09.603 --> 01:12.840
till the soil, plant seeds,
water them daily,

01:12.873 --> 01:14.342
and harvest the mature plant.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.809
And that's just the beginning.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.479
Someone had to make
the raw cotton into fabric.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.682
Someone had to dye the white
cotton different colors.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.786
Someone had to make a thread and
a needle to sew it all together.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.257
Someone had to build a store
and rack

01:29.290 --> 01:31.525
and a hanger
to hang the shirt on!

01:33.394 --> 01:37.165
You purchased the superhero
costume at the store?

01:37.198 --> 01:40.901
The point is hundreds of people
were involved in the creation

01:40.934 --> 01:43.137
of this single garment!

01:43.171 --> 01:46.340
Hard to believe it took that many
people to make a shirt that ugly.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.845
Robin made a good point. I'd never
considered the importance of...

01:51.879 --> 01:53.814
Let's hit the beach!

01:55.249 --> 01:56.250
Time to get wet!

01:58.652 --> 02:03.257
Ooh! Soon we will be swimming with
the peanut butter and the jelly fishes.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.560
Let's make sure we have everything
we need for a day of fun in the sun

02:06.594 --> 02:09.330
while being fully protected
from its deadly radiation.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.332
- Sunglasses.
- Check.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.367
- Sunscreen.
- Check.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.502
Beach umbrella?

02:18.606 --> 02:20.674
Who forgot the beach umbrella?

02:20.708 --> 02:22.343
I can't tell no lies, son.

02:22.376 --> 02:23.544
That was me.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.413
Great.
Now, we'll have no shade.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.316
Oh, we are doomed to do
the frying in the sun.

02:33.321 --> 02:34.922
What we are gonna do?

02:34.955 --> 02:38.292
What if we just made
our own beach umbrella?

02:38.326 --> 02:39.460
What, you crazy?

02:39.493 --> 02:40.894
That sounds like a lot of work.

02:40.928 --> 02:44.465
Exactly! An appropriate
way to celebrate Labor Day!

02:44.498 --> 02:46.300
Wouldn't you say?

02:46.334 --> 02:48.336
Yeah, Robin's right.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.271
How hard could it be?

02:50.304 --> 02:52.640
Okay, Titans.
Everyone clear on their jobs?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.209
Cut and sculpt wood
for the pole.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.644
Create the screws and hinges.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.347
The gluing together of the
palm fronds for the canopy.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.614
What are you going to
use for glue?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.755
Tree sap.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.359
Looks like everything
is in order.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.660
Titans, build!

03:23.437 --> 03:25.539
We made an umbrella, y'all!

03:25.573 --> 03:27.508
Take that, the sun!

03:30.478 --> 03:31.812
I'm proud of us, Titans.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.282
With a little ingenuity
and a lot of hard work,

03:34.315 --> 03:36.617
we built something
with our bare hands.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.387
Now, back to check list.
Beach umbrella?

03:39.420 --> 03:40.454
Check.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.523
- Beach ball?
- Check.

03:42.556 --> 03:43.757
Tortilla chips.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.463
Who forgot the chips?

03:49.497 --> 03:52.466
I can't tell no lies, son.
That was me, too.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.034
No, the chips?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.804
The beach day is the
ruined without the chips!

03:58.406 --> 03:59.707
What are we gonna do?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.576
You're forgetting that
today is Labor Day!

04:02.610 --> 04:04.412
We'll make our own chips.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.281
Yeah, Robin's right.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.916
How hard could it be?

04:08.949 --> 04:11.552
To make tortilla chips, the first
things we are going to need

04:11.585 --> 04:12.620
are corn and wheat.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.654
Titans, grow!

04:26.834 --> 04:28.902
Ah! What a bountiful harvest.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.838
Now, we'll need to mix
the corn and wheat

04:30.871 --> 04:32.573
with water and lime
to make masa dough.

04:32.606 --> 04:33.741
What's masa dough, yo?

04:33.774 --> 04:38.479
It's a mixture of corn, and
wheat, and water, and limes.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.513
Now, start!

04:44.752 --> 04:46.954
I need more lime
for the masa, yo.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.657
Starfire, can you get
the lime dude on the phone?

04:49.690 --> 04:52.626
He's currently on the strike
over the dispute of the labors.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.796
Our entire production will be delayed
and we'll never get to the beach.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.432
We need those limes!

04:58.466 --> 05:00.033
Did someone say limes?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.536
But, how?
The lime guy is on strike.

05:02.570 --> 05:05.406
Let's just say
they fell off a truck.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.982
Get that dough
onto the conveyor belt.

05:23.724 --> 05:24.492
Mmm...

05:24.525 --> 05:26.760
- Ah!
- No tasting the merchandise.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.464
Ah.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.569
Ah.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.442
We made chips, y'all!

05:41.475 --> 05:42.643
We're not done yet.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.445
These chips need to be packaged.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.813
Ah.

06:05.733 --> 06:06.934
Yeah!

06:08.869 --> 06:12.640
Wow! I never realized all the work
that went into some dumb chips.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.775
Can we eat some now?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.710
No! It's Labor Day!

06:16.744 --> 06:21.181
We are going to enjoy the fruits of
our labor in leisure at the beach.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.018
- What's happening?
- We're out of gas.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.121
We are never going to
make it to the beach now!

06:28.155 --> 06:31.725
Yes, we will!
By making our own gasoline.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.794
Oh, you've gotta be kidding!

06:33.827 --> 06:36.730
I'm already so tired, brah!

06:36.764 --> 06:37.865
What's a little fatigue

06:37.898 --> 06:39.733
compared to
the mastery we will feel

06:39.767 --> 06:42.736
when tapping into one of Earth's
most powerful natural resources.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.676
The first step to making gasoline
is finding a deposit of oil.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.877
Titans, dig!

07:09.963 --> 07:11.732
Sorry, dude.
There ain't no oil down there.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.769
Just a bunch of giant fruit
and a fire breathing monster.

07:15.803 --> 07:19.540
Hmm, that's too bad. I guess
we'll have to make our own oil!

07:19.573 --> 07:21.809
Beast Boy, turn yourself
into a dinosaur.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.511
You gots it!

07:23.544 --> 07:25.579
Great! Cyborg,
whip up a time machine.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.948
I don't know where you're
going with this, but okay.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.117
Boo-ya!

07:30.150 --> 07:33.453
Okay, Beast Boy. It's time to
go on a magical adventure.

07:43.597 --> 07:48.068
Goodbye, my friend. I'll see you
in 65 million years and two minutes.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.873
Um, hello?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.542
Anybody here?

07:54.575 --> 07:55.676
Oh, what up?

08:03.951 --> 08:06.286
Robin, where is
the friend Beast Boy?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.821
If my calculations are correct,

08:07.855 --> 08:09.790
he should be right about here!

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
I turned into oil, yo!

08:15.963 --> 08:18.966
- Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah, boy!

08:18.999 --> 08:22.970
Let us feed it to the car, so that
we may continue on to the beach.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.707
This is just crude oil. We need
to refine it to make gasoline.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.941
More labor.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.943
But, I'm so tired.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.145
We are so close,
we must toil on.

08:32.179 --> 08:36.016
My arms can toil no the longer.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.652
Hard work is
what gives us purpose.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.053
Muscles aching to work,

08:40.087 --> 08:42.289
minds aching to create,

08:42.322 --> 08:45.959
this is man!

08:45.993 --> 08:49.029
Also, if you don't do it, I'll take away
your pensions, your health insurance,

08:49.062 --> 08:51.565
and your company tote bags.

08:52.499 --> 08:55.836
Okay, you monster, we'll do it.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.038
Nothing's ever gonna
tear us apart, baby.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.999
Well, Titans, we have a lot
to be proud of this Labor Day.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.669
You know, I used to think that
labor was just for them

09:28.702 --> 09:29.770
pregnant ladies.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.640
But, now, having experienced
the back breaking work

09:32.673 --> 09:36.877
that goes into the creation of the
everyday items which we take for granted,

09:36.910 --> 09:39.179
we have the deeper understanding
of the work ethic

09:39.212 --> 09:40.648
that makes our nation,

09:40.681 --> 09:43.350
and, indeed,
the entire human race,

09:43.383 --> 09:44.985
truly the great.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.253
You can say that again.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.021
We have the deeper...

09:48.055 --> 09:51.091
And, now, we can finally enjoy
our super fun day at...

09:51.124 --> 09:52.059
The beach!

09:55.062 --> 09:56.196
I can't believe this!

09:56.229 --> 09:58.131
We spent so much time
making stuff

09:58.165 --> 09:59.700
it's not even Labor Day anymore.

09:59.733 --> 10:02.069
- It's winter.
- That's it. I'm outta here.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.171
Way to go, Robin.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.205
That's how it is, huh?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.774
You're all just gonna quit.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.042
Well, I'm taking away
your tote bags!

10:10.310 --> 10:11.311
Keep it!
