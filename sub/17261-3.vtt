BUT NOW THAT WE'RE DATING,
I CAN WEAR THEM ALL THE TIME.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.162
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DIMPLES?

10:26.625 --> 10:29.003
- HOW DID IT GO
WITH THE WEBSITE PEOPLE?

10:29.086 --> 10:31.630
- WELL, I TOLD THEM I DIDN'T
WANT TO DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.382
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
AND I THINK THEY'D BE

10:33.466 --> 10:34.884
TOTALLY MISGUIDED
TO GO WITH OLIVIA.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.053
- THANK YOU, VICTORIA.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.013
THEY'RE GOING WITH OLIVIA.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.557
- WHAT?
- IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.017
THEY JUST FIND HER
MORE LIKABLE.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.227
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

10:45.311 --> 10:49.482
- WELL, IT MEANS THAT THEY
FIND HER MORE LIKABLE THAN YOU.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.401
- I KNOW THAT, YOU IDIOT.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.695
- NEW JOY DOESN'T SAY THINGS
LIKE THAT.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.405
- THEY'RE STILL GOING
TO CALL HER JOY?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.866
- OH, THE NAME JUST TESTED
THROUGH THE ROOF,

10:58.949 --> 11:02.078
SO THERE'S A WIN FOR YOU.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.538
- AY-YUP, GIRLIES.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.165
VICTORIA, WE BETTER GET GOING
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE THERE

11:06.248 --> 11:08.084
FOR THE START
OF THE CAVS GAME.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.378
- OH, YEAH, WE'RE SHOOTING AN
EPISODE THERE FOR THE WEBSITE.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.297
- BUT JOY AND VICTORIA GOING
TO THE CAVS GAME WAS MY IDEA.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.924
- OH, AND WE'RE STILL DOING IT.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.093
JOY AND VICTORIA ARE GOING
TO THE CAVS GAME.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.595
ANOTHER WIN FOR YOU.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.933
- SOMEBODY GET RID OF THESE.

11:24.016 --> 11:27.144
- OH, GOD, THESE ARE
SOME WELL-UGLY SPECS.

11:27.228 --> 11:30.773
WE HAVEN'T MET.
I'M NEW JOY.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.443
- OH, I APPROVE.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.617
- YOU DOING BETTER?

11:41.700 --> 11:43.160
- A LITTLE.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.162
- EVENTUALLY, THEY'RE GOING
TO COME HOME AND FIND US.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.790
- SURE, SURE.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.625
- BOY, THIS IS REAL FOR YOU,
ISN'T IT?

11:49.708 --> 11:52.044
- YEAH, YEAH,
SINCE I WAS A KID.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.839
SEE, WHEN I WAS SMALL,
TO SAVE MONEY, MY FAMILY HID ME

11:54.922 --> 11:56.590
IN THE TRUNK WHEN WE WOULD GO
TO DRIVE-IN MOVIES.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.300
AND ONE TIME,
THEY FORGOT ABOUT ME,

11:58.384 --> 12:00.594
AND I WAS IN THERE
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.929
I STILL REMEMBER
THE MOVIE TOO.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.974
IT WAS CHEECH AND CHONG
<i>UP IN SMOKE.</i>

12:05.057 --> 12:05.933
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

12:06.016 --> 12:08.602
- IT WAS NO BETTER HEARD
THROUGH A TRUNK.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.104
- [chuckles]

12:10.187 --> 12:13.649
- AND SINCE THEN, I'VE BEEN
AFRAID OF SMALL SPACES.

12:13.732 --> 12:16.485
AND CHEECH AND CHONG.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.320
- REALLY?
CHEECH AND CHONG?

12:18.404 --> 12:21.198
LIKE, "DAVE'S NOT HERE, MAN."

12:21.282 --> 12:22.450
- STOP IT, STOP IT!

12:22.533 --> 12:25.703
- I'M SORRY. JEEZ.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.998
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE CRAZY FEARS TOO.

12:29.081 --> 12:33.127
I AM SCARED TO DEATH
OF BUTTERFLIES.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.171
- BUTTERFLIES?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.797
BUTTERFLIES CAN'T HURT YOU.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.467
- NEITHER CAN
CHEECH AND CHONG.

12:44.263 --> 12:45.055
- TRUCE?

12:49.059 --> 12:52.021
I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING
WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID OF AND, UH,

12:52.104 --> 12:53.481
HELPING ME TO CALM DOWN.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.566
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.361
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:59.445 --> 13:00.571
- NOTHING.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.410
- NOTHING.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.329
- WHAT ARE WE DOING?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.164
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.374
BUT I'M ABOUT TO--
- GO FOR IT.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.459
- [sneezes loudly]

13:19.256 --> 13:21.884
- DOOR'S OPEN.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.554
- UH, SORRY ABOUT THE SNEEZE.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.182
- SO, UM, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

13:28.265 --> 13:30.267
- NOTHING.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.436
- GOOD.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.772
JUST CHECKING.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.608
SO I'LL, UH, SEE YOU AT WORK?
- YEAH, SEE YOU AT WORK.

13:37.691 --> 13:38.651
- YEAH, YOU WANT ME
TO FIX THIS DOOR?

13:38.734 --> 13:40.986
- NO, NO.
I LIKE IT THERE.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.538
- I GUESS
VICTORIA'S STILL SLEEPING.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.956
SHE MUST HAVE GOTTEN HOME LATE
FROM THE CAVS GAME

13:52.039 --> 13:53.541
WITH HER NEW FRIEND.

13:53.624 --> 13:57.044
- I SAW VICTORIA AND NEW JOY
ON THE JUMBOTRON.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.004
- CAN WE NOT CALL HER NEW JOY?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.507
- OKAY, OLD JOY.

14:06.845 --> 14:07.972
- GOOD MORNING, VICTORIA.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.598
OR WOULD YOU PREFER...
[exaggerated accent]

14:09.682 --> 14:13.561
"COR BLIMEY, VICTORIA,
GOOD BLEEDING MORNING"?

14:13.644 --> 14:16.105
- LISTEN, JOY, I KNOW
THAT LAST NIGHT WAS BAD.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.148
- BAD?
IT WAS TYPICAL.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.776
SO TYPICAL OF YOU, VICTORIA,

14:20.859 --> 14:23.737
TO SACRIFICE YOUR FRIENDS
TO CLIMB THE LADDER OF SUCCESS.

14:23.821 --> 14:27.116
BUT THIS TIME, YOU INVITED ME
ON THAT LADDER WITH YOU.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.285
AND JUST AS I WAS BEGINNING
TO ENJOY THE VIEW,

14:29.368 --> 14:31.078
YOU KICKED ME OFF.

14:31.161 --> 14:32.955
NEXT TIME, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE ME TO THE DESERT,

14:33.038 --> 14:35.416
HAVE ME DIG MY OWN GRAVE HOLE,
AND SHOVE ME IN?

14:35.499 --> 14:37.960
- I COULD GO FOR A TRIP
TO THE DESERT.

14:41.589 --> 14:45.175
- LOOK, JOY, I KNOW I DESERVE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST SAID.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.596
AND THAT'S WHY LAST NIGHT
I TOLD THE WEBSITE PEOPLE THAT

14:48.679 --> 14:52.308
YOUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS MORE
THAN THIS PROJECT, AND--

14:52.391 --> 14:53.309
AND I QUIT.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.936
- YOU QUIT?
- YEAH.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.606
- BUT THAT WEBSITE'S IMPORTANT
TO YOU.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.608
- NOT AS IMPORTANT AS YOU.

15:00.691 --> 15:04.612
I REALIZED SOMETHING
AT THAT BASKETBALL GAME.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.280
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH A PERSON

15:06.363 --> 15:08.991
WHO IS YOUNG AND BUBBLY
AND LIKABLE.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.119
I WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOU.

15:12.202 --> 15:15.456
- REALLY?
OH, VICTORIA, I'M SO TOUCHED.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.291
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:17.374 --> 15:18.792
I'M GONNA GET SOME CHAMPAGNE,

15:18.876 --> 15:21.629
SO WE CAN CELEBRATE
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.384
- THAT WAS A NICE THING
YOU DID.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.055
- WELL, IT'S JUST
THE KIND OF PERSON I AM.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.016
- THEY FIRED YOU, DIDN'T THEY?

15:34.099 --> 15:36.518
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.146
APPARENTLY NEW JOY TESTED BETTER
THAN I DID,

15:39.229 --> 15:40.856
SO NOW THEY'RE BUILDING
THE WHOLE WEBSITE AROUND HER

15:40.939 --> 15:43.192
INSTEAD OF ME.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.820
BUT I FEEL BAD.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.530
DO YOU THINK I SHOULD TELL JOY
THE TRUTH?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.867
- NO.
IT WOULD HURT HER FEELINGS.

15:51.950 --> 15:55.120
LET ME DO IT.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.834
- ELKA?

16:00.918 --> 16:02.961
- OVER HERE.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.882
- IT'S THE STRANGEST THING.

16:06.965 --> 16:09.551
NOW I CAN'T FIND
MY SPARE PAIR OF GLASSES.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.053
- NO.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.763
- I'VE LOOKED
ALL OVER YOUR PLACE.

16:12.846 --> 16:16.058
- WELL, THE LAST TIME
I SAW THEM,

16:16.141 --> 16:19.019
THEY WERE UNDER THE COVERS.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.063
LET'S GO LOOK THERE.

16:43.293 --> 16:46.046
- HELLO, FRANKIE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.508
- HELLO, MELANIE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AS WELL.

16:55.180 --> 16:59.226
- SO, UM, THAT THING THAT DIDN'T
HAPPEN IN THE CLOSET YESTERDAY,

16:59.309 --> 17:01.437
THAT'S NOT GOING TO AFFECT US
HERE RIGHT?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.062
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
NOTHING DIDN'T HAPPEN

17:02.146 --> 17:03.605
IN THE CLOSET YESTERDAY,

17:03.689 --> 17:06.066
AND, UH, SECOND,
THE SHOW COMES FIRST, SO--

17:06.150 --> 17:07.067
- I'M GLAD WE'RE CLEAR.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.609
- ME AS WELL.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.821
- UP NEXT,<i> HE SAID, SHE SAID</i>

17:11.905 --> 17:13.866
WITH FRANKIE AND MELANIE.

17:13.949 --> 17:17.286
TURN UP YOUR RADIO,
AND LET THE BATTLE BEGIN.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.246
[explosion sound effect]

17:19.329 --> 17:20.204
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.958
OUR FIRST CALLER IS TOM
FROM CUYAHOGA FALLS.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.041
- YEAH, HI.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.669
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR TEN YEARS,

17:25.752 --> 17:28.589
AND NOW WE'RE ONLY HAVING SEX
LIKE ONCE A MONTH.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.048
WHAT DO I DO?

17:30.132 --> 17:32.968
- WELL, UM, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS

17:33.051 --> 17:36.472
IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP THAT ARE
LEADING TO HER LACK OF INTEREST.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.016
- YEAH, I DON'T REALLY CARE WHY.
I JUST WANT MORE.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.142
RIGHT, FRANKIE?

17:40.225 --> 17:43.020
- I ACTUALLY THINK MELANIE
HAD A PRETTY GREAT POINT.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.689
- WELL, THANK YOU, FRANKIE.
- YOU'RE WELCOME, MELANIE.

17:45.773 --> 17:46.982
- SHOULD WE TAKE ANOTHER CALL?
- I THINK WE SHOULD.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.942
- OKAY.

17:49.026 --> 17:51.904
- HEY, GUYS, UH, SO WHAT
HAPPENED WITH THOSE SHELVES?

17:51.987 --> 17:53.322
- NOTHING HAPPENED.
- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.449
- BUT SHE SCREWED IT UP,
RIGHT?

17:55.532 --> 17:57.659
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE ENDED UP WORKING TOGETHER,

17:57.743 --> 17:59.161
AND IT WAS
A PRETTY SUCCESSFUL ENDEAVOR.

17:59.244 --> 18:02.331
NOW MELANIE HAS A SHELF
THAT SHE CAN PUT THINGS ON.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.958
- UH-HUH. DID SHE PUT YOUR BALLS
ON THAT SHELF?

18:05.042 --> 18:06.794
- HEY.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.004
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.
THERE'S A LADY HERE, ALL RIGHT?

18:09.087 --> 18:12.716
- THANK YOU, FRANKIE.
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME, MELANIE.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.677
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS BREAK.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.678
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
WE'RE TERRIBLE.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.679
- I KNOW!

18:17.763 --> 18:18.889
WE'RE GONNA GET
KICKED OFF THE AIR

18:18.972 --> 18:21.183
IF WE SPEND THE NEXT THREE HOURS
AGREEING WITH EACH OTHER.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.143
- LOOK, THIS WHOLE THING STARTED
BECAUSE YOU TRIED TO KISS ME.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.895
- I TRIED TO KISS YOU?
NO, NO, NO.

18:24.978 --> 18:26.355
YOU TRIED TO KISS ME.
YOU LEANED IN.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.648
- YOU LEANED IN.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.858
- THE POINT IS,
THERE WAS LEANING.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.027
- I CAN'T DO THIS SHOW
IF YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR ME.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.029
- OH, PLEASE.
FEELINGS FOR YOU.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.823
THE ONLY FEELING I HAVE FOR YOU
IS UTTER DISGUST.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.075
- RIGHT BACK AT YA, BABY.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.368
OH, THIS IS GOOD.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.203
- I KNOW!
THIS IS US.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.540
- AND WE'RE BACK.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.500
TO THAT CALLER EARLIER WHO WAS
ONLY GETTING IT ONCE A MONTH,

18:46.583 --> 18:48.877
I ACTUALLY AGREE
WITH MELANIE.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.213
HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH YOUR WIFE.
HERE'S THE DIALOGUE.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.548
"PUT OUT OR GET OUT."

18:52.631 --> 18:54.508
- PLEASE, FRANKIE'S JUST JEALOUS
OF ANY MAN

18:54.591 --> 18:55.801
THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY
FOR IT.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.637
- AND MELANIE
CAN'T GIVE IT AWAY FOR FREE.

19:03.976 --> 19:10.399
- SO THAT'S WHY A THERMOS
KEEPS THINGS BOTH HOT AND COLD.

19:10.482 --> 19:14.278
GOODNESS, I'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THERMOSES FOR 40 MINUTES.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.197
- HAS IT ONLY BEEN 40?

19:18.949 --> 19:22.870
LOOK, JIM, ABOUT US,
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN FUN--

19:22.953 --> 19:24.621
- AH, HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.958
IT'S KIND OF BRIGHT OUT HERE.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.463
- OH.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.758
OH, YOU LOOK GOOD
IN THOSE GLASSES.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.844
DAMN GOOD.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.599
- ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE PRESCRIPTION.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.768
- SO YOU DON'T NEED
YOUR OTHER GLASSES?

19:46.852 --> 19:49.771
- NO.
THESE ARE EASIER ON MY EYES.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.775
- THEY'RE EASIER
ON MY EYES TOO.

19:53.859 --> 19:58.405
- SO, UM, WHAT WERE YOU
GOING TO TELL ME?

19:58.488 --> 20:00.490
- I CAN'T REMEMBER.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.494
- ELKA, I WANTED TO MENTION,

20:04.578 --> 20:07.456
I'M GOING TO HAVE
SOME DENTAL SURGERY LATER ON,

20:07.539 --> 20:11.126
AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK
FOR A FEW DAYS.

20:11.209 --> 20:14.338
- WE'LL MAKE IT WORK.
