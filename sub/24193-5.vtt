02:00.829 --> 02:01.830
Here.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.499
Sorry, it leaked.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.294
Check if everything is there.

02:14.343 --> 02:15.344
That's my tip.

02:36.823 --> 02:37.658
COPYING

03:03.225 --> 03:04.226
COPY COMPLETE

03:07.104 --> 03:08.605
Is there any fresh coffee?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.399
I don't know. Have a look.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.327
Sophia?

03:26.123 --> 03:27.124
Sophia Loren?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.268
Is this a romantic date?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.106
Let me fill your glass.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.235
What a treat!

03:55.318 --> 03:56.153
Here.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.202
A toast.

04:13.545 --> 04:14.588
Bite me.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.682
Ah, stop that or I'll come.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.854
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

05:36.545 --> 05:37.546
Just chilling?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.965
It's not what it looks like, Guilhome.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.842
I didn't do anything. I
have nothing to do with it.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.386
Relax, dude!

05:44.469 --> 05:48.557
- Wait up. Why take pictures?
- It won't come back to you.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.560
It's a kink of mine.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.813
I like watching people do it.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.899
She's got some curves, huh?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.842
There's a bunch of things in there.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.678
Flash drive.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.763
I need coffee.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.684
Is it hot?

06:33.935 --> 06:36.146
It's colder than Ibrahim's wife.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.023
Just kidding. It's great.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.697
What about that brandy? Where is it?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.199
No brandy. We don't drink on the clock.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.913
- I hardly sleep anymore.
- I don't know what sleep is.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.045
I brought you a gift.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.431
Man, this is...

07:12.682 --> 07:13.683
It's brandy!

07:15.518 --> 07:17.812
- Is it brandy?
- A lot of it, sir.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.985
Fuck! This is gold!

07:26.571 --> 07:32.452
Ibrahim's wife was an ambulance chaser,
but she was far from being stupid.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.412
Remember the plea bargain

07:34.496 --> 07:37.082
that freed the son of a bitch
in the State Bank case?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.291
It was her idea.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.920
When her husband was
released, she laughed at me.

07:42.712 --> 07:47.300
But now that he was jailed,
it was my turn to laugh.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.593
Visiting day?

07:49.552 --> 07:52.514
- Did they let you go?
- I never got arrested.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.766
I saw you destroy the hearing room.

07:54.849 --> 07:58.353
Bipolar disorder. Sometimes I
get upset and break stuff.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.521
I see.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.694
- What did you bring him?
- None of your business.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.570
Is it that sticky candy?

08:09.406 --> 08:10.865
But does he really deserve it?

08:17.163 --> 08:20.625
It's like those late night
jail porn movies, remember?

08:20.709 --> 08:21.835
You remember.

08:22.419 --> 08:23.420
Remember?

08:40.562 --> 08:42.147
You son of a bitch!

08:42.230 --> 08:43.398
- Stella!
- That Kitano?

08:43.481 --> 08:44.774
Do you really believe it?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.776
It's a ploy. They set me up!

08:46.860 --> 08:48.570
You disgust me.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.030
It's photoshopped.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.489
I'm going to finish you.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.241
In custody?

08:54.743 --> 08:57.037
- What do you think?
- Good morning.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.163
Good morning.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.081
What's going on?

09:00.165 --> 09:01.875
A marital spat in custody.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.546
- I'm going to finish you.
- It's photoshopped!

09:06.629 --> 09:09.632
I'm going to tell them the
stuff they don't know.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.135
- Do you hear me?
- Don't believe them! It's a ploy.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.179
Stella, listen to me!

09:14.262 --> 09:15.555
Listen to what I'm saying!

09:17.265 --> 09:18.391
What's that paper?

09:18.475 --> 09:19.476
I don't know.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.645
I couldn't see. I just
know that he's pissed.

09:23.813 --> 09:24.647
Stella!

09:29.861 --> 09:32.489
Ibrahim was a thug in middle school.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.077
A thug in high school.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.998
And then he dropped out of school
to get involved in smuggling.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.754
The fucker always laughed at me.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.298
Now the tables were turning.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.675
Twenty-nine years of marriage.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.553
It's bullshit. They've
destroyed my family.

10:09.943 --> 10:14.364
I know, Rigo was almost the death
of me with Operation State Bank.

10:14.948 --> 10:18.118
But now, even though I don't want
to, I have to give the guy credit.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.745
- Morning, Liana.
- Morning, sir. This just came in.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.166
Even with two congressmen
involved in the case...

10:25.708 --> 10:28.878
he asked the second instance
to leave JPR with him.

10:29.420 --> 10:30.421
He was brave.

10:31.256 --> 10:35.677
Judge Rigo? I apologize, sir, but
something important's just arrived.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.471
Any other judge would have
washed his hands of the problem.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.056
Hi, Liana.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.559
They denied separate trials, sir.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.687
They want everything sent
to the Supreme Court.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.983
They're ordering João Pedro's release.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.070
Comply.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.204
But Rigo was too proud.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.374
He would not take no for an answer.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.669
The best thing for me to do...

11:10.837 --> 11:12.463
was give him the ammunition.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.554
Look at this.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.098
Are you sick?

11:23.182 --> 11:25.268
Just tired. Look at it.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.900
- JPR's sending money overseas?
- "Money"?

11:31.983 --> 11:34.193
It's $23 million!

11:35.069 --> 11:37.947
It's too faint. I can't make
out those last figures.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.326
A foreign bank, illegal remittance,
60 million reais. It's all there.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.745
Thousands of banks start
with these numbers.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.121
We can figure it out.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.081
But I'm saying it's highly complex.

11:48.875 --> 11:49.918
Do you speak English?

11:50.960 --> 11:55.089
- I understand a bit, but barely speak it.
- I barely understand and speak even worse.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.842
- I get by.
- Great! Go for it.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.014
Is this all we have?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.808
He's sending money abroad.
It's potential evidence.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.560
- We can use it.
- It's incredible.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.146
But with all the work we already have...

12:10.730 --> 12:12.357
And there are numbers missing.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.777
- It's a lot of work.
- Get on it. There are 24 hours in a day.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.654
Don't wanna work? Become an artist.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.531
The case has been suspended.

12:21.449 --> 12:24.702
The Supreme Court will decide if
separation of the case is valid.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.246
Should we just stop working?

12:26.829 --> 12:29.457
Investigation is suspended
until the Supreme Court votes.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.126
The Supreme Court never reconsiders.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.214
- Let's wait.
- Can I at least question JPR?

12:36.297 --> 12:39.175
- I have a good lead.
- João Pedro Rangel is getting released.

12:39.842 --> 12:42.679
- What?
- I can't believe it. This is an insult!

12:43.888 --> 12:46.224
The Supreme Court will
issue the release order.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.188
Gentlemen, that's it for now. Thank you.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.108
Excuse me.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.445
The Supreme Court accepted
the Wizard's thesis.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.532
Rigo made a mistake and the
Wizard took advantage of it.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.242
But it's the beginning of the end.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.452
You're going to wake up
from this nightmare.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.621
- You're being released.
- That's great!

13:09.706 --> 13:11.165
That couldn't be better!

13:11.916 --> 13:12.917
Thank you.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.338
Ibrahim!

13:17.839 --> 13:18.840
Ibrahim!

13:19.465 --> 13:21.426
We're getting out of here!

13:22.051 --> 13:24.470
Everyone is getting out!

13:25.054 --> 13:28.182
It went to the Supreme Court!

13:32.186 --> 13:35.314
- Hey... What?
- We're free!

13:36.024 --> 13:39.027
It went to the Supreme Court, guys!
We're free!

13:39.110 --> 13:43.281
It went to the Supreme Court!
We're getting out of here!

13:44.032 --> 13:47.618
- Ibra!
- We're getting out of here!

13:47.702 --> 13:51.205
- Ibra!
- It went to the Supreme Court!

13:51.914 --> 13:54.834
I'm getting out! I'm going home!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.502
I'm leaving!

13:56.586 --> 13:58.463
Everyone is leaving!

13:59.005 --> 14:01.924
I'm going home! I can't believe it!

14:02.759 --> 14:07.597
- Suck it! Yes!
- Get us some booze.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.348
- Spend what you want.
- Champagne?

14:09.432 --> 14:10.641
You pick.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.646
How do they already know?

14:15.730 --> 14:17.523
It's impossible. It can't be.

14:18.107 --> 14:21.569
- Do you know that agent?
- Just in passing.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.363
He seems all right. Why?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.325
I find him too restless.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.369
It's weird.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.624
Jet Wash suspended. Any
questions, deputy?

14:34.707 --> 14:37.001
None. No questions. None at all.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.842
Are we really going to stop?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.303
What about the foreign
banks I have to check?

14:47.387 --> 14:50.223
It'll have to wait.
Roberval is watching me.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.643
Verena, it's a huge number of banks!

14:56.938 --> 14:58.773
What I do at home is my own business.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.119
The Supreme Court's order
to cancel Jet Wash...

15:11.911 --> 15:13.287
encouraged the corrupt.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.793
Besides suggesting that the
process would end up in Brasília

15:18.876 --> 15:20.962
and that everyone would be released,

15:21.045 --> 15:25.591
it freed João Pedro Rangel,
who was in temporary custody.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.221
That asshole went back home.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.516
The same home Ibrahim helped him
buy with other people's money.

15:37.228 --> 15:38.229
That's fucked up.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.773
I don't believe in miracles,

15:41.607 --> 15:44.318
but I think it was time to start praying.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.059
It was so cold in there.

16:23.399 --> 16:28.821
Today, the Supreme Court will rule on
the severance of Operation Jet Wash

16:28.905 --> 16:32.575
requested by Judge Paulo Rigo of
the 13th Federal District Court.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.077
The judge requested severance

16:35.161 --> 16:38.164
when those with parliamentary
immunity became involved.

16:43.711 --> 16:45.505
Severance is requested

16:45.588 --> 16:49.383
to stop suspects from being favored
by the delay in the process

16:49.467 --> 16:51.677
as there is a large number of suspects...

16:51.761 --> 16:53.679
What's happening?

16:53.763 --> 16:56.140
It's a ploy to get the
investigation to Brasília.

16:56.891 --> 16:57.892
A ploy? By whom?

16:58.935 --> 17:01.812
It's easier to find a giraffe
in Brasília than an honest guy.

17:05.273 --> 17:09.569
If the first instance of the Supreme Court
decided on the severance of the case...

17:10.154 --> 17:13.281
João Pedro Rangel's destiny
would still be in Rigo's hands.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.828
But if they decided the entire
case had to move up to Brasília,

17:17.912 --> 17:20.498
Operation Jet Wash would
be killed and buried.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.462
Six judges, one sentence.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.839
It was doomsday.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.677
Without further inconvenience,

17:32.760 --> 17:37.723
and considering the natural
fate of the inquiries,

17:37.807 --> 17:40.643
I hereby uphold the severance

17:40.726 --> 17:45.356
suggested by the 13th Federal
District Court judge, Paulo Rigo.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.364
Hey. How are you?

17:53.447 --> 17:54.615
- Excuse me.
- Welcome.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.243
- My wife, Júlia.
- How are you?

17:57.326 --> 17:58.828
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.413
- Hey.
- How are you?

18:00.496 --> 18:01.497
It's one null for us.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.874
Impossible to tell what was coming.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.797
In Brazil, political dispute is gang war.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.593
of involvement with
currency dealers...

18:13.676 --> 18:14.510
Come on.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.054
I vote for the return of
the inquiries to Curitiba.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.598
Two null.

18:18.681 --> 18:22.226
Some of the judges had been appointed
when the opposition was in power.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.105
And the opposition wanted to
see all hell break loose.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.233
The main question was...

18:29.775 --> 18:31.444
how many judges did they have?

18:32.278 --> 18:36.032
my vote is against the severance.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.075
Two against one! It's turning.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.911
- You're way too optimistic.
- I am.

18:41.662 --> 18:42.663
I really am.

18:42.747 --> 18:47.877
severance is the appropriate
instrument in these cases.

18:48.669 --> 18:53.049
That being said, I vote for returning
the inquiries to Curitiba.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.509
That's it. Three to one.
There's only one vote left.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.056
with evidence obtained
before that date

19:00.139 --> 19:02.558
as well as legal grounds.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.395
Based on this, I accept the severance.

19:06.479 --> 19:10.900
I vote for the return of the inquiries
to the first-instance judge.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.654
Let's have a drink?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.283
Congratulations, honey!

19:24.413 --> 19:25.790
Better get used to Curitiba.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.418
I warned you.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.213
The Jet Wash victory

19:32.296 --> 19:34.590
meant there was a smell
of blood in the air.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.426
The corrupt were fighting each other.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.470
But sooner or later,

19:39.553 --> 19:43.849
they would realize that Jet Wash
was going to blow them all up.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.643
We had to move fast.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.979
- Five to one!
- Supreme victory.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.524
Did it burn?

19:52.024 --> 19:54.860
It said 40 minutes. 45 have gone by.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.863
Forget the book, Dimas.
I just follow my heart.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.783
But you are "Incredible Cláudio."

20:01.367 --> 20:02.702
Not even close.

20:04.036 --> 20:04.870
Hey!

20:06.038 --> 20:07.665
- Nice to see you!
- How's it going?

20:08.749 --> 20:11.210
- Hello, Verena. How are you?
- How are you, Dimas?

20:12.586 --> 20:14.630
- I brought some wine.
- Thank you!

20:16.298 --> 20:18.801
- Excuse me.
- Vander!

20:20.344 --> 20:23.055
- How are you? Welcome.
- How's it going?

20:23.139 --> 20:24.724
I parked as close as possible.

20:25.599 --> 20:27.977
- Thank you.
- This is my wife, Júlia.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.271
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

20:30.354 --> 20:31.981
I'm fine. Welcome.

20:32.940 --> 20:33.983
Hey.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.610
- Would you like a beer?
- Sure!

20:36.694 --> 20:38.320
- It's so big!
- And how are you?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.365
First, to Curitiba!

20:42.283 --> 20:43.701
To five against one!

20:44.285 --> 20:46.245
To the one who brought us together again.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.497
Yes. But I miss Ruffo.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.166
I wasn't here before, but I am now.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.543
We didn't allow people
from Rio de Janeiro.

20:53.461 --> 20:54.462
Where are you from?

20:55.296 --> 20:56.297
Made in Curitiba.

20:57.465 --> 21:00.176
And to our honorable
representative from Rondônia.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.471
- I'm actually from Londrina.
- From Londrina?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.139
I've traveled a lot, but yes.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.099
- Beautiful city.
- Thanks.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.851
Would you like some lasagna?

21:25.951 --> 21:26.952
It's me. Open up.

21:27.912 --> 21:28.913
Open up, Verena.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.617
You didn't stop investigating.

23:30.951 --> 23:31.952
I did well, huh?

23:32.786 --> 23:34.955
You think those foreigners
are going to help?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.127
Where did that list come from?

23:41.795 --> 23:42.796
That...

23:43.964 --> 23:46.925
Guilhome found it. It's a
good lead, but it's complex.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.011
It's a lot of work.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.812
Would you like some help?

23:59.563 --> 24:02.274
With money, life is easy.

24:03.192 --> 24:06.153
The Prosecutor's Office had
more people, more computers...

24:06.820 --> 24:08.113
and access to everything.

24:08.781 --> 24:12.618
They could do in a day what took
the federal police a month to do.

24:12.701 --> 24:13.702
No, Renata.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.622
I don't think so.

24:17.206 --> 24:20.042
- Everything changes all the time.
- This indecision sucks!

24:20.125 --> 24:21.710
My life is on hold.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.420
Should I quit or not?

24:23.504 --> 24:25.381
Renata, let me explain something.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.968
Yes. Right.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.721
I have no way of knowing.
It was suspended.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.641
After that five to one, it's back on.
Anything can happen.

24:35.724 --> 24:39.269
I just think it's foolish to decide
before we know if I'm staying.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.688
Because it isn't your life.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.606
You need to make up your mind.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.108
I gotta go. We'll talk later.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.652
- OK.
- Love you, hun.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.195
Mission accomplished, boss.

24:57.913 --> 24:59.957
We found the bank. In Geneva.

25:07.297 --> 25:09.133
- Afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

25:09.717 --> 25:10.676
He's expecting me.

25:21.895 --> 25:22.896
Cláudio.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.983
- How are you?
- Good afternoon, sir.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.914
$23 million in Switzerland.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.917
Bank statement, bank
manager declaration...

25:45.002 --> 25:46.003
It's all there.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.474
FEDERAL POLICE

26:32.382 --> 26:33.634
I love you so much.

26:35.844 --> 26:36.845
Let's go, sir.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.666
The inquiries were off-limit.
You carried on behind my back!

27:05.749 --> 27:06.667
I was doing my job!

27:06.750 --> 27:09.378
The police chief called
asking why he wasn't informed

27:09.461 --> 27:11.171
JPR was going back to jail.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.426
- What? I didn't know either.
- You didn't know?

27:16.510 --> 27:19.012
Weren't you investigating
his money in Switzerland?

27:19.096 --> 27:21.431
Didn't you find the fucking
$23 million in Geneva?

27:21.515 --> 27:23.141
Exactly! I was investigating!

27:23.225 --> 27:24.226
Go to hell!

27:24.810 --> 27:27.104
- I didn't know, Roberval.
- Enough, Verena!

27:42.035 --> 27:44.538
João Pedro Rangel knew so much

27:44.621 --> 27:47.916
that even the ex-president,
"The Boss," got involved.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.842
With the Wizard's support,
things would flow better.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.052
I don't know what they're
thinking, Mário.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.016
João Pedro in the hands of these
people in Curitiba is crazy!

28:05.809 --> 28:08.228
It's dangerous, indeed.

28:08.937 --> 28:09.938
Dangerous.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.692
I'm worried about the pressure.

28:14.568 --> 28:18.113
People react differently.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.073
He might crack.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.825
We can't risk it.

28:24.161 --> 28:27.956
- We'll have to act as a unit.
- Attack everyone together.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.708
Not attack!

28:30.500 --> 28:33.670
Join forces and put together an
agreement with the contractors

28:33.754 --> 28:36.965
in order to halt the investigation.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.719
Admit guilt on corruption
within Petrobrasil

28:40.802 --> 28:42.638
and agree on an amount...

28:44.139 --> 28:47.684
that stands for a symbolic restitution.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.939
Yes, I... What I know is that we need...

28:52.981 --> 28:54.399
to staunch the bleeding.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.860
I trust you.

29:07.996 --> 29:10.624
- Ten years later and you do it again?
- What's up?

29:10.707 --> 29:13.377
I don't know if it went to
your head and you can't see it

29:13.460 --> 29:15.545
or if you just wanted all the praise.

29:15.629 --> 29:16.463
Verena...

29:16.546 --> 29:18.715
The State Bank. The
agreement with Ibrahim.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.842
- It was the Prosecutor's Office!
- We had sex.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.845
- No... Not again, Verena.
- I was investigating the banks.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.347
- I was.
- I was helping you.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.557
He's been arrested. Isn't
that what you wanted?

29:27.641 --> 29:29.393
You didn't even bother telling me.

29:29.476 --> 29:32.187
Are we going to do this again?
I'm not the bad guy here.

29:33.063 --> 29:36.233
You guys got rid of Ruffo. And
now you want to get rid of me.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.736
You're as paranoid as he was!

29:40.487 --> 29:43.490
I don't want anything from you.
I just want to work in peace.

29:43.573 --> 29:47.202
So go tell Roberval I have
nothing to do with JPR's arrest.

29:47.286 --> 29:50.038
The $23-million investigation
was all your idea, right?

29:50.998 --> 29:53.125
Is it that important whose idea it was?

30:05.095 --> 30:06.930
It's $23 million.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.311
Have you guys checked
the security cameras?

30:19.484 --> 30:22.029
- Where are you from?
- Rondônia.

30:22.112 --> 30:25.615
- To our representative from Rondônia.
- I'm actually from Londrina.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.288
Don't shoot, Ruffo! It's me.

33:00.770 --> 33:01.938
You never stopped.

33:06.610 --> 33:08.528
You thought I couldn't do it by myself?

33:12.115 --> 33:13.783
Roberval keeps on sabotaging me.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.161
Guilhome is your mole.

33:17.871 --> 33:19.998
Cláudio fucked me over again.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.337
And you're here in a
garage, playing detective.

33:27.380 --> 33:31.301
You could have fucked up an operation
that's way bigger than Ibrahim.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.766
Say something! Answer me!

33:43.021 --> 33:44.231
I just wanted to help.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.650
I need authorization to question JPR.

34:29.734 --> 34:33.029
- He won't talk.
- Am I authorized?

34:33.780 --> 34:34.906
I want to be informed

34:34.989 --> 34:37.617
of every step of the
investigation, understood?

34:37.701 --> 34:39.244
Isn't that why I'm here?

34:43.706 --> 34:45.292
Women are crazy.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.918
Sexist pig, son of a bitch.

34:48.878 --> 34:50.589
I never received a car.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.259
I have no money behind a
wall, much less overseas.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.013
How do these things happen?

34:58.847 --> 35:00.765
I know you're not like Ibrahim.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.393
Ibrahim was born into crime.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.187
You studied, you had a career.

35:07.731 --> 35:09.482
I don't know how you got here.

35:10.650 --> 35:15.864
There are factors, contexts,
extenuating circumstances.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.161
But you need to tell
me what happened, sir.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.343
I have nothing to say.

35:48.480 --> 35:49.481
Verena!

35:50.273 --> 35:54.194
Everyone has a weakness. We'll find his.
He'll talk.

35:54.277 --> 35:55.612
He'll talk. You'll see.

35:56.112 --> 35:57.989
There's no "we."

35:58.531 --> 36:01.201
Ruffo may trust you, but
I don't trust anyone

36:01.284 --> 36:03.662
who joins my team without
saying who he is.

36:03.745 --> 36:07.791
Go back to Londrina, Bahia, Rondônia,
or wherever the hell you're from.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.251
To Ruffo's garage. Get
the hell out of here!

36:17.300 --> 36:18.301
Guess what?

36:21.137 --> 36:22.764
Rigo's authorized Jaraguara.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.642
Jaraguara is a terrible idea.

36:25.725 --> 36:29.229
A quick stop in hell is going
to open our friend's mind.

36:29.312 --> 36:33.024
- What happened? What's going on?
- You're being transferred.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.568
- Where to?
- State prison.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.323
- He could get killed in there.
- Or worse.

36:40.740 --> 36:41.908
I sent someone for him.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.578
You can't do this. Who authorized it?
Does my attorney know?

36:45.662 --> 36:47.997
Only the Bible is allowed
where you're going.

36:49.332 --> 36:51.251
Tonight, he sleeps in Jaraguara.

36:51.835 --> 36:55.004
He'll be begging to talk
when he gets there.

36:58.133 --> 37:01.302
You did the Switzerland deal.
JPR's arrest. And now Jaraguara?

37:01.386 --> 37:03.930
- But you asked...
- I asked you here and I don't agree!

37:06.641 --> 37:09.519
I should go back to my PhD and
let you play "Super Cláudio."

37:10.103 --> 37:11.146
Sorry...

37:11.229 --> 37:14.524
There's more. Taking a Petrobrasil
CEO out of Jaraguara in a body bag

37:14.607 --> 37:15.859
is not going to look good!

37:26.661 --> 37:29.998
JARAGUARA STATE PRISON 1.2 MILES

38:04.866 --> 38:06.743
You're the prisoner involved in politics?

38:07.744 --> 38:11.706
We know you have a lot of money.
Are you going to share it with us?

38:36.439 --> 38:37.649
Am I staying here?

38:37.732 --> 38:40.735
- Do you prefer the collective cell?
- No.
