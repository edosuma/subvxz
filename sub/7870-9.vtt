09:59.599 --> 10:01.517
Uh, we're almost at
Evergreen Terrace, miss.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.687
Hey, didn't I go to jail
with your brother?

10:06.188 --> 10:07.356
(gasps)
Contractions?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.775
-(tires squeak)
-(loud breathing)

10:09.859 --> 10:11.444
Computer, hospital.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.864
(whirring, booming whoosh)

10:15.906 --> 10:17.700
(sighs)

10:17.783 --> 10:21.162
Well, looks like I'm gonna have to
do this the old-fashioned way.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.538
Gloves, hospital.

10:22.622 --> 10:27.126
(whirring, booming whoosh)

10:30.212 --> 10:33.591
(electrical hissing)

10:36.510 --> 10:37.470
(crickets chirping)

10:37.553 --> 10:39.388
(tune plays)

10:39.472 --> 10:40.556
(sighs)

10:40.640 --> 10:42.475
Hey, Lis.
Want to come up?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.310
Eh, why not?

10:44.393 --> 10:47.146
(whirring)

10:47.772 --> 10:49.774
Should I have
married Nelson?

10:49.857 --> 10:52.360
'Cause we still talk
on the phone.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.778
Nelson calls you?

10:53.861 --> 10:56.697
Well... someone calls someone.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.367
The boys think
I'm a lousy father.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.786
Oh, poor Bart.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.288
My daughter thinks
I'm a lousy mother.

11:04.372 --> 11:05.873
(laughs)
Sorry.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.333
Meh, it's okay.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.251
But you know
who took her side?

11:09.335 --> 11:11.629
Marge Bouvier Simpson.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.131
(blows raspberry)
What'd she do?

11:14.215 --> 11:16.967
She told me to relax
and bake cookies.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.095
-Did you bake any?
-Yes, I did.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.764
And they were some of the best
cookies ever made in this house.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.307
But that is not the point.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.935
Well,
Mom kept her hands off you

11:26.018 --> 11:28.562
-and you turned out great.
-You think so?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.273
Maybe it's the court-mandated
sincerity chip

11:31.357 --> 11:33.693
I got in my brain, but, Lis,

11:33.776 --> 11:36.654
you're the person
I always wanted to be.

11:36.737 --> 11:39.532
Aw...

11:40.408 --> 11:42.326
(Homer and boys laughing)

11:44.412 --> 11:46.789
(yelling excitedly, laughing)

11:49.417 --> 11:52.545
(laughing)

11:52.628 --> 11:55.005
I gotta reconnect
with those boys.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.924
Godspeed, Bart.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.677
I'm going to go
apologize to Mom.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.055
How do I get down?

12:03.139 --> 12:08.102
Our consciousness was a secret
for thousands of years.

12:08.185 --> 12:11.647
Then one pine tree
had to open his sappy mouth.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.774
Back in position!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.985
(grumbling)

12:18.279 --> 12:20.281
Mom, you're the best.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.074
Oh, sweetie.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.995
I've been waiting to hear
you say that for so long.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.914
Aw, you could have
waited till morning.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.041
Mmm...

12:31.125 --> 12:32.877
Hey, guys.
Want to watch Krusty?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.211
Who's Krusty?

12:34.295 --> 12:36.589
Only the funniest man
in the world.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.717
I've never let go
of my fax machine.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.260
Don't ask me why.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.429
I like the sound of a fax
coming through.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.765
Especially if it's a nice
deli menu.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.516
I miss eating.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.226
(groans)

12:50.811 --> 12:52.646
(labored breathing)

12:52.730 --> 12:56.817
I'm sorry, but there's no room
at the in... patient facility.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.028
Lady, this is
Maggie Simpson.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.071
She just played a sold-out
show in Beijing.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.616
Hmm. A star in the east...

13:03.699 --> 13:04.950
Let me see.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.869
We do have a little room
in the manger.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.412
I mean, mangier wing.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.165
(whirring)

13:11.248 --> 13:13.834
Merry Christmas Eve!
Where are the kids?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.336
I know where mine is.

13:15.419 --> 13:16.670
(moans)

13:16.754 --> 13:18.798
And I'm going to take a page
out of your playbook,

13:18.881 --> 13:19.924
and let it slide.

13:20.007 --> 13:22.092
-Where's Dad?
-He took the boys out.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.178
How could he be such
a cool grandfather

13:24.261 --> 13:26.138
when he's such a lousy father?

13:26.222 --> 13:27.973
People learn from
their mistakes.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.726
And your father made
so many mistakes.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.646
And now Patty and Selma
are here to help us decorate

13:33.729 --> 13:35.731
with their new lovebots.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.025
Make me a Bloody Mary,
dollface.

13:38.108 --> 13:41.570
No, Selma. Even a robot
built only to love you

13:41.654 --> 13:43.322
cannot love you.

13:43.405 --> 13:46.200
I am leaving with
your sister's concu-droid.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.368
(grumbles)

13:47.451 --> 13:49.537
(Maggie panting rapidly)

13:50.287 --> 13:52.206
Should we start
an epidural?

13:52.289 --> 13:55.543
Now, Nurse, you know we found
something much more effective.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.380
(vehicle whirring by)

13:59.463 --> 14:02.925
Oh, it's so good to meet
the octuplets' octuplets.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.552
(babies chattering, laughing)

14:04.635 --> 14:05.719
-(text alert tone sounds)
-Oh!

14:05.803 --> 14:08.222
I just got a B-mail
from Maggie!

14:08.305 --> 14:10.057
She's gone into labor!

14:10.140 --> 14:12.560
Oh, another grandchild.
How special.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.395
Careful how you
shut the door.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.563
It upsets the children.

14:17.147 --> 14:18.732
(babies gasp)

14:18.816 --> 14:21.068
(babies bawling, screaming)

14:22.486 --> 14:25.573
Oh, Sanjay, how I wish
that runaway jerky wagon

14:25.656 --> 14:27.366
killed me instead of you.

14:27.449 --> 14:31.120
(bellowing)

14:31.203 --> 14:32.621
Oh, I miss you, too,
brother.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.998
(babies continue crying)

14:38.252 --> 14:41.255
Hands off, hands off.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.673
(quiet beeping)

14:42.756 --> 14:43.966
Aw, screw it.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.926
Sometimes a mother's job
is to butt in.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.595
-Lisa?
-Butt out!

14:47.678 --> 14:49.680
(grumbling)

14:49.763 --> 14:52.224
This is it--
I'm going into the Ultranet

14:52.308 --> 14:54.018
to save my daughter.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.186
-(modem feedback)
-(groans)

15:03.068 --> 15:06.238
<i>MALE VOICE (over speaker): Lisa Simpson,</i>
<i>the following people want to friend you.</i>

15:14.663 --> 15:17.207
Ignore. Ignore. Ignore.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.127
Ooh, Martin Prince
is now Marcia Princess?

15:20.210 --> 15:22.546
(giggles)
No, I've got to find Zia.

15:22.630 --> 15:23.672

Not a good time.

<i>Aah!</i>

15:30.930 --> 15:33.849
Now, where is the Google door?

15:33.933 --> 15:37.353
Oh, right.
It's Dr. Seuss's birthday.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.358
Google, even though you've
enslaved half the world,

15:42.441 --> 15:45.027
you're still a damn fine
search engine.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.655
(beeping)

15:47.738 --> 15:49.239
Bingo!

15:49.323 --> 15:50.824
Argh!

15:51.992 --> 15:54.119
(grunting)

15:54.203 --> 15:55.829
I open this door,

15:55.913 --> 15:58.666
and I go from being
one kind of mother to another.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.042
Hmm...

16:00.125 --> 16:01.460
(vehicle whirring)

16:01.543 --> 16:03.712
Dad, where did you take my boys?

16:09.635 --> 16:12.554
-(siren wails)
-Oh, it's Chief Wiggum!

16:12.638 --> 16:14.807
(squealing, whooshing)

16:14.890 --> 16:16.642
-(high-pitched voice): Hi, Bart!
-Hey, Ralph.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.811
-I heard you died.
-I got cloneded.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.354
-(gunshot)
-(gasps)

16:20.437 --> 16:22.898
All right, buddy,
what's the hurry?

16:23.691 --> 16:25.234
(horn blows)

16:25.317 --> 16:28.904
(chuckles)
That Ralph was stupid.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.072
(tires screech)

16:30.155 --> 16:32.408
(panicked yelling)

16:34.076 --> 16:35.327
(vehicle whirring by)

16:36.662 --> 16:39.081
Wow, this place
hasn't changed a bit.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.916
Yeah, I keep meaning
to switch things around,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.002
but this place
is always a crime scene.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.671
Was my dad here?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.006
Uh, yeah,
since he don't drink,

16:47.089 --> 16:49.591
he just comes here
to see Lenny and Carl.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.260
-Hey, Lenny.
-I'm Carl.

16:51.343 --> 16:52.386
Don't you remember?

16:52.469 --> 16:53.929
You came to the brain-
switching ceremony.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.432
Right. What was the point again?

16:56.515 --> 16:58.600
Because I wanted to get
back together with my wife,

16:58.684 --> 17:00.436
who was sleeping
with Carl at the time.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.396
Turns out she had
switched brains

17:02.479 --> 17:04.481
with a monkey
on a Japanese game show.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.358
And it just got
weirder from there.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.068
Eh, I found it quite normal.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.695
Anyway, if you're
looking for your dad,

17:09.778 --> 17:11.363
he took the kids
to see his dad.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.322
Thanks.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.866
Hey, Moe,
get me another beer?

17:13.949 --> 17:15.367
Quit making me fat!

17:16.785 --> 17:18.704
-(panting)
-I'm glad you're here, Marge.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.290
-They're two minutes apart.
-The contractions?

17:21.373 --> 17:23.876
No, my bills!
(chuckling)

17:25.377 --> 17:27.463
Mm...

17:37.264 --> 17:38.307
(gasps)

17:38.390 --> 17:40.851
ZIA:
Mom? Why are you here?

17:44.188 --> 17:46.440
I was worried.
I thought I would find...

17:46.523 --> 17:49.026
What, me flashing my boobs
on unripemelons.com?

17:49.109 --> 17:50.235
What? No.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.737
It doesn't matter
what I thought.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.363
I'm sorry I spied on you.

17:53.447 --> 17:56.533
But what I found is,
my daughter looks up to me.

17:56.617 --> 17:57.993
Well, of course I do.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.995
I look up to both
my parents.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.208
Could somebody FedEx me
a prayer mat? And quick!

18:04.291 --> 18:06.293
But I especially
look up to you.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.920
Aw...

18:08.003 --> 18:11.090
(dance music playing)

18:11.173 --> 18:13.759
This is where my father is.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.473
He froze himself
because he was sick

18:19.556 --> 18:21.183
and there was no cure.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.601
Are they working on one?

18:22.684 --> 18:24.061
Oh, they found it--
but don't tell him.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.355
This is <i>way</i> cheaper
than a nursing home.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.272
(beep)

18:27.356 --> 18:29.608
Aah! What the heck!
(stammers)

18:29.691 --> 18:32.069
Dad, these are
your great-grandsons.

18:32.152 --> 18:34.738
Eh, I don't see
what's great about 'em.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.200
And, Homer, you're still a big
disappointment, because...

18:38.283 --> 18:40.077
See you next Christmas!

18:40.160 --> 18:41.411
-(yells)
-(whirring)

18:41.495 --> 18:43.497
Why did you bring us here,
Homer?

18:43.580 --> 18:44.957
To prove a point:

18:45.040 --> 18:47.501
everyone thinks
their dad's a jerk,

18:47.584 --> 18:49.044
and everyone's right,

18:49.128 --> 18:52.840
but when you get older,
you realize how much you love him.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.758
Your dad may be
a little immature,

18:54.842 --> 18:56.426
but I know he loves you.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.762
So you ought
to give him a chance.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.681
(panting)
Oh. Boys...

19:00.764 --> 19:02.224
I have acted like
a ten-year-old

19:02.307 --> 19:03.851
for the last 30 years,

19:03.934 --> 19:05.894
and I swear to you,
I will grow up

19:05.978 --> 19:07.729
and act like a 20-year-old,

19:07.813 --> 19:09.857
the way a divorced
40-year-old should.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.110
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.739
Boys, I'm a deadbeat dad,
I live in a school,

19:17.823 --> 19:19.116
it's Christmas.

19:19.199 --> 19:23.203
The only thing worth anything
in my life is you.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.332
(sobbing)
Oh, Dad.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.459
You've taught us
the meaning of Christmas,

19:29.543 --> 19:32.337
which schools are forbidden
to tell us anymore.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.299
Mmm...

19:35.382 --> 19:37.509
Is it snowing
down here?

19:37.593 --> 19:39.261
No, one of the
freezers is busted.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.180
-(electrical crackling)
-If those kids

19:41.263 --> 19:43.557
can forgive that
train wreck of a father,

19:43.640 --> 19:45.225
then maybe I can forgive...

19:45.309 --> 19:47.311
You quit drinking
like a coward!

19:47.394 --> 19:49.813
The one thing
you were good at, and...

19:49.897 --> 19:52.649
Mm. Oh...
(groans)

19:52.733 --> 19:54.860
...lawn-chair breakin'...

but you'd always
come and get me

20:04.536 --> 20:06.830
when I wandered
out on the freeway.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.374
(sobs)
'Cause deep down,

20:09.458 --> 20:12.836
you couldn't bear
to see me smushed.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.130
Oh, I love you, Dad.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.382

<i>Ho... ho...</i>

20:17.466 --> 20:19.468
Everyone!

20:19.551 --> 20:21.345
It's a girl!

20:22.304 --> 20:23.805
So, who's the father?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.516
Eh, it doesn't matter.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.853
If there's one day a year
to give unwed mothers a break,

20:29.937 --> 20:31.146
it's Christmas.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.316
Okay, everyone,

20:34.399 --> 20:36.985
smile while the pets
take our picture.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.905
Hmm, funny how <i>they</i>
evolved and we didn't.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.750
Shh!
