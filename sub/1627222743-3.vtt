08:50.363 --> 08:51.800
Uh, whatever.

08:51.843 --> 08:53.845
I know a fixer on Bonestell
who can repair anything.

08:53.889 --> 08:56.239
It's a quick warp, then we'll
head back to the Cerritos

08:56.282 --> 08:58.241
with a nonruined post for T'Ana.

08:58.284 --> 08:59.503
Uh, okay.

08:59.547 --> 09:01.244
Well,
as long as we're back on time.

09:01.287 --> 09:02.724
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we should be.

09:02.767 --> 09:04.856
Yeah, uh, let's just get moving.
[chuckles]

09:04.900 --> 09:07.250
-Girls' trip.
-TENDI: Girls' trip.

09:11.515 --> 09:13.038
[gasps]

09:13.082 --> 09:15.084
-Rutherford.
-Sir.

09:15.127 --> 09:17.042
We've got
this Tom Paris thing later,

09:17.086 --> 09:19.044
but maybe after that,
racquetball?

09:19.088 --> 09:20.176
You sure you're up for that?

09:20.219 --> 09:21.786
You know,
with what you went through?

09:21.830 --> 09:24.876
Eh, that place
did take a lot out of me.

09:24.920 --> 09:27.444
-But not
my killer serve. [laughs]
-[Billups laughs]

09:27.487 --> 09:29.315
Ah, Shaxs, you always get me.

09:29.359 --> 09:31.274
Help you, Ensign?

09:31.317 --> 09:32.754
Oh. [chuckles]
I just...

09:32.797 --> 09:35.060
The truth is
I was just wondering how...

09:35.104 --> 09:36.932
CODY:
Whoa, Shaxs is back?

09:36.975 --> 09:39.761
Didn't you die? How the heck
did you come back to life?

09:39.804 --> 09:41.850
-[all gasp]
-SHAXS: Oh.

09:41.893 --> 09:44.504
Lieutenant Junior Grade Cody,
that is out of line!

09:44.548 --> 09:47.377
Report to your supervisor
for immediate reassignment.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.987
I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to...

09:49.031 --> 09:51.163
[crying]:
Just go.

09:52.164 --> 09:53.513
But he wasdead. I...

09:53.557 --> 09:55.515
[breathes deeply]

09:55.559 --> 09:57.953
What was it you wanted to ask?

09:57.996 --> 09:59.955
[chuckles]:
Oh, uh, uh...

09:59.998 --> 10:02.479
Uh, how do you hit
a racquetball?

10:02.522 --> 10:04.176
With a racket.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.788
Oh! Right. Cool.

10:06.831 --> 10:08.528
So, you, uh,
still having flashbacks?

10:08.572 --> 10:11.140
Having one right now.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.406
ADDIX:
Yeah, I can fix it. The trick is

10:16.449 --> 10:18.277
making it look
like it was never damaged.

10:18.321 --> 10:19.539
And how much
will that put us back?

10:19.583 --> 10:21.411
For my old friend
Beckett Mariner?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.369
Double. 50 strips.

10:23.413 --> 10:25.981
What-- 50? Where are we supposed
to find that much latinum?

10:26.024 --> 10:27.809
You've got a deal.

10:27.852 --> 10:29.506
What are you doing?
We can't afford that.

10:29.549 --> 10:31.203
Yes, we can.
We just need to find

10:31.247 --> 10:32.552
the biggest,
dumbest guys in here.

10:32.596 --> 10:34.032
-[laughs]
-[indistinct chatter]

10:37.209 --> 10:39.908
Come on, come on.

10:41.039 --> 10:43.041
[growls]
Cheater!

10:43.085 --> 10:45.348
You claimed
you were only a beginner.

10:45.391 --> 10:47.916
Yeah, I'm beginning
to school your ugly ass.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.874
-How dare you!
-Hey! No fighting.

10:49.918 --> 10:51.833
I just got that table rejotted.

10:51.876 --> 10:54.444
You want to finish this game,
you do it with proxies.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.142
Works for me. My partner's
even better than I am.

10:57.186 --> 11:00.450
[scoffs] An Orion? She will use
her pheromones to cheat us.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.365
[gasps]
No, she won't.

11:02.408 --> 11:04.976
Oh, that is
such a messed up thing to say.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.283
But, like, could you, you know,
just, like, juice it a bit?

11:07.326 --> 11:08.850
-Just a little?
-[gasps] Mariner!

11:08.893 --> 11:10.416
Of course not.
I'm not even that kind of Orion.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.288
I can't believe
you'd even say that.

11:12.331 --> 11:14.203
Uh, just checking.
No, no. No, you got this.

11:14.246 --> 11:15.334
-Take a shot.
-[Tendi sighs]

11:16.379 --> 11:17.859
Uh...

11:17.902 --> 11:19.034
Uh... Come on.

11:19.077 --> 11:21.471
-[growls]
-[Mariner grunts]

11:22.994 --> 11:25.083
-[gasps]
-I won?
-[crowd cheering]

11:25.127 --> 11:26.476
I won!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.217
-Yeah!
-[chanting]: Dom-jot! Dom-jot!

11:28.260 --> 11:29.871
All right, pay up.

11:29.914 --> 11:32.874
Cheaters don't deserve
Nausicaan latinum.

11:32.917 --> 11:34.571
[grunts]

11:34.614 --> 11:36.486
No!

11:36.529 --> 11:39.010
-Hey! What'd I say
about... Whoa!
-[grunts]

11:39.054 --> 11:40.446
Oh, crap! Okay, guys, listen.

11:40.490 --> 11:41.926
I know we may not look
like a lot,

11:41.970 --> 11:43.101
but when it comes to a fight,

11:43.145 --> 11:44.581
us Starfleet officers
are trained to...

11:44.624 --> 11:45.887
-Latinum!
-[Nausicaans growl]

11:45.930 --> 11:47.453
Tendi, run!

11:47.497 --> 11:49.499
[Boimler grunting, straining]

11:52.154 --> 11:53.895
[panting]

11:53.938 --> 11:55.635
If I follow this path,
I'll be on the catwalk

11:55.679 --> 11:57.942
above the grav stabilizer's
static diffusers.

11:57.986 --> 12:00.423
[exhales] Almost to the bridge.
Don't worry, plate.

12:00.466 --> 12:02.425
There's no plausible reason
why anyone should be purging

12:02.468 --> 12:03.992
the static right now.

12:07.169 --> 12:09.954
It's a pleasure to have you
on my bridge, Lieutenant Paris.

12:09.998 --> 12:11.913
Pleasure's all mine,
Captain Freeman.

12:11.956 --> 12:13.610
Mind if I give her a whirl?
I hear

12:13.653 --> 12:16.308
-these Cali-class engines
can purr.
-Of course.

12:16.352 --> 12:18.354
Just don't send us
to the Delta Quadrant.

12:18.397 --> 12:20.008
[all laugh]

12:20.051 --> 12:21.966
All right.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.447
Oh, no. Oh, no.

12:24.490 --> 12:25.970
[shrieks]

12:28.190 --> 12:29.452
Computer, emergency shutdown!

12:29.495 --> 12:31.019
COMPUTER:
Authorization not recognized.

12:31.062 --> 12:34.587
You don't need authorization
in an emergency!

12:35.632 --> 12:38.330
[exhales]
Ah, my plate. Okay.

12:38.374 --> 12:40.985
She's okay. [kisses]
Aah! Hot plate. Ow, my lips.

12:41.029 --> 12:42.508
Okay, I'm fine.
The plate is fine.

12:42.552 --> 12:44.293
Got to keep moving.

12:46.338 --> 12:47.949
[yowls]
Where the hell are you, Ensign?

12:47.992 --> 12:50.125
My fur feels
like it's covered in poison.

12:50.168 --> 12:52.518
We're on our way back.
The package is completely intact

12:52.562 --> 12:54.085
-and...
-Hurry!

12:54.129 --> 12:56.131
[groans] This was supposed to be
my chance

12:56.174 --> 12:59.090
to show Dr. T'Ana that I'm ready
for more, but I failed her!

12:59.134 --> 13:00.526
Uh, look,
don't be so hard on yourself.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.137
-It was just a mistake.
-I don't get

13:02.180 --> 13:03.747
to make mistakes like you do.

13:03.791 --> 13:05.444
It was hard
getting into the Academy.

13:05.488 --> 13:07.272
There's still a lot of stigma
around Orions.

13:07.316 --> 13:10.362
A lot of humans think
we're all thieves and pirates.

13:10.406 --> 13:11.711
Wait.

13:11.755 --> 13:13.191
My cousin works
in a thieves' den

13:13.235 --> 13:14.671
in a pirate outpost
in this sector.

13:14.714 --> 13:16.325
-He might be able
to help us out.
-Uh, okay.

13:16.368 --> 13:18.327
As long as you aren't bothered
by the optics,

13:18.370 --> 13:19.981
-I mean, it works for me.
-[sighs]

13:20.024 --> 13:21.634
Well, these are bad Orions.

13:21.678 --> 13:24.028
They'd kill you on the spot
just for being human.

13:24.072 --> 13:27.727
-Well, I'm not into that.
-But don't worry, I have a plan.

13:27.771 --> 13:32.254
[gasps]
All right, undercover op.

13:32.297 --> 13:34.517
[grunting]

13:38.347 --> 13:40.262
[Rutherford grunts]

13:40.305 --> 13:42.525
Just got to focus on work.

13:42.568 --> 13:44.048
[exhales]
Come on. Focus.

13:44.092 --> 13:46.659
Rutherford. I fought my way
out of the multiverse.

13:46.703 --> 13:49.749
That is a lie. The Borg
put my body into the Collective.

13:49.793 --> 13:52.187
You...
[stammers]

13:52.230 --> 13:55.494
A microscopic civilization
brought me back to life

13:55.538 --> 13:58.541
to harness the powers of my body
with a tiny Dyson sphere.

13:58.584 --> 14:01.152
-Uh...
-It was no transporter accident.

14:01.196 --> 14:03.241
-Resistance is futile.
-Mirror, mirror, mirror.

14:03.285 --> 14:05.722
What was the deal with T'Pol's
hair for that one year?

14:05.765 --> 14:07.550
-In the Nexus,
it's always Christmas.
-[screams]

14:07.593 --> 14:08.768
I got to know!

14:08.812 --> 14:10.727
[panting]

14:19.431 --> 14:21.564
Honestly, this feels wrong.

14:21.607 --> 14:23.566
I mean, just please don't take
any pictures of me.

14:23.609 --> 14:25.698
Okay, remember,
the effect won't last long,

14:25.742 --> 14:27.570
so we need to find D'Onni quick.

14:27.613 --> 14:30.747
Well, what if I don't sound
like an Orion, though?

14:30.790 --> 14:32.618
Just talk like a pirate.

14:33.663 --> 14:36.709
[imitating pirate]: Arr, how ye
be doing today, me fellow Orion?

14:36.753 --> 14:39.234
Uh, why are you talking
like that?

14:39.277 --> 14:40.670
-Allergies.
-[normal voice]: Yeah,
I'm allergic

14:40.713 --> 14:42.498
to, um, uh, pheromones.

14:42.541 --> 14:43.629
-Oh, I hear you.
-[metal clanging]

14:43.673 --> 14:45.196
They're really bad
this time of year.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.546
That's D'Onni up there.

14:47.590 --> 14:51.289
-He does art forgeries.
-Uh, and he's hot?

14:52.247 --> 14:54.466
Tendi, you got to warn me
if we're gonna be meeting up

14:54.510 --> 14:55.772
with a sexy bad boy.

14:55.815 --> 14:57.295
That's my type.
Well, one of my types.

14:57.339 --> 14:58.775
You have a thing for bad boys?

14:58.818 --> 15:00.733
Oh, I'm always dating bad boys,

15:00.777 --> 15:02.692
bad girls,
bad gender nonbinary babes,

15:02.735 --> 15:05.086
ruthless alien masterminds,
bad Bynars.

15:05.129 --> 15:07.610
Huh. I don't know if I've
ever seen you date anyone.

15:07.653 --> 15:09.220
You usually seem to be
with Boimler.

15:09.264 --> 15:11.266
[laughs]:
What? Ew, no! What?

15:11.309 --> 15:13.572
-Ew, that is so messed up.
-What? I don't know. You guys

15:13.616 --> 15:15.270
practically sleep
in the same bunk.

15:15.313 --> 15:16.793
Ew, we do not! Ew!

15:16.836 --> 15:18.621
He's like a pet. Yuck.

15:18.664 --> 15:20.101
What, are you
and Rutherford dating?

15:20.144 --> 15:21.580
-TENDI: Not really.
-Cousin?

15:21.624 --> 15:24.148
[gasps]
Biceps.

15:24.192 --> 15:26.542
You shouldn't be here.
If the Syndicate catches me

15:26.585 --> 15:28.283
-talking to... [grunts]
-You'll do
what I tell you to do,

15:28.326 --> 15:30.154
you dumb-face jerk!

15:31.373 --> 15:33.331
-Holy crap,
who are you right now?
-It's an Orion thing.

15:33.375 --> 15:35.116
It actually makes me
really uncomfortable.

15:35.159 --> 15:37.857
D'Onni, I have a piece of, uh,
loot I need you to repair.

15:37.901 --> 15:39.816
It has to look like
it was never broken in order

15:39.859 --> 15:41.731
to rip someone off.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.603
Anything for you, Mistress
of the Winter Constellations.

15:44.647 --> 15:46.562
Mistress
of the Winter Constella...?

15:46.605 --> 15:48.651
What? Okay, you got to do this
on the Cerritos.

15:48.694 --> 15:51.306
Don't tell anyone. That's a name
I left behind long ago.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.655
I'll try, but it's...

15:52.698 --> 15:55.832
-Oh, crap.
-D'Vana, what is this?

15:55.875 --> 15:58.617
-Is she an imposter?
-Shut up and do your job!

15:58.661 --> 16:01.490
"D'Vana"? Is that some other
weird title you've got?

16:01.533 --> 16:03.231
It's my name.

16:03.274 --> 16:04.754
-Oh.
-TENDI: What,

16:04.797 --> 16:07.235
you don't even know
my first name?

16:07.278 --> 16:08.323
I thought it was Tendi,

16:08.366 --> 16:10.151
like, with no last name.
Like Odo.

16:10.194 --> 16:12.892
We have been working together
for over a year, Beckett.

16:12.936 --> 16:15.330
-Well, now you're
just showing off.
-You don't know me at all.

16:15.373 --> 16:17.941
-Well, youdon't know me.
-Hey! You don't have allergies!

16:17.985 --> 16:19.377
Uh...

16:19.421 --> 16:21.510
She's wearing false green!
Grab her!

16:21.553 --> 16:23.294
[crowd clamoring]

16:28.647 --> 16:30.606
-[grunts]
-[crowd shouts]

16:30.649 --> 16:31.868
[Mariner and Tendi grunt]

16:31.911 --> 16:33.826
-Get her!
-[crowd clamoring]

16:33.870 --> 16:36.699
-[Mariner and Tendi panting]
-False green! False green!

16:36.742 --> 16:37.743
Run!

16:40.833 --> 16:42.661
[panting]

16:42.705 --> 16:44.185
Why don't you just do

16:44.228 --> 16:45.490
your "bossing everyone around"
voice again?

16:45.534 --> 16:47.318
Yeah, it doesn't work
on angry mobs.

16:47.362 --> 16:50.191
Which you would know if you knew
anything about me orOrions.

16:50.234 --> 16:51.757
You're the one who wanted
to do a girls' trip.

16:51.801 --> 16:53.368
Because I thought
we were friends!

16:53.411 --> 16:54.412
Yeah, well, apparently,

16:54.456 --> 16:55.457
we're just people
who work together.

16:55.500 --> 16:56.675
Yeah, soon we'll just be people

16:56.719 --> 16:57.894
who get our asses kicked
together.

16:57.937 --> 16:59.504
[male breathing heavily]

16:59.548 --> 17:01.767
[growls, grunts]

17:01.811 --> 17:03.378
[grunts]

17:03.421 --> 17:05.249
[panting]

17:06.250 --> 17:07.991
TENDI: [groans]
They're all over the lift.

17:08.035 --> 17:10.472
[squeaking]
