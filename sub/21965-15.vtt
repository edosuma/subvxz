you are neither.

He is now. Dad made Blades

00:15.750 --> 00:19.625
our official troop mascot.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.834
That doesn't explain why Chief

00:19.667 --> 00:22.834
dragged the rest of us out here.

00:22.875 --> 00:26.583
For the nature hike.

00:22.875 --> 00:26.583
Graham said everyone's invited.

00:26.625 --> 00:29.291
We'll spot animals

00:26.625 --> 00:29.291
to earn our wildlife patch,

00:29.333 --> 00:31.500
and climb rocks for our

00:29.333 --> 00:31.500
outdoorsman patch,

00:31.542 --> 00:33.667
and sing songs for

00:31.542 --> 00:33.667
our musical theatre patch.

CHIEF:

00:37.792 --> 00:39.792
Gather round, everyone.

Hey! Watch it,

00:45.041 --> 00:47.041
Kade!

Oh. What did somebody

00:47.083 --> 00:51.125
have grumpy-Os for breakfast?

00:51.166 --> 00:54.041
For today's trek,

00:51.166 --> 00:54.041
we'll be using the buddy system.

00:54.083 --> 00:56.792
That way we can be sure

00:54.083 --> 00:56.792
nobody gets lost or--

Help's here.

Heatwave.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.333
( grunts )

02:04.458 --> 02:07.333
( yelps )

02:07.375 --> 02:09.959
Rescue method

02:07.375 --> 02:09.959
is too dangerous.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.500
Great plan,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.500
Kade.

02:11.542 --> 02:12.750
Like you could

02:11.542 --> 02:12.750
do better?

02:12.792 --> 02:15.792
Glad you agree.

02:12.792 --> 02:15.792
Blades, airlift.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.583
Ugh.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.041
Rescue robots,

02:26.625 --> 02:29.041
work together.

02:48.834 --> 02:53.458
(  triumphant theme playing  )

02:53.500 --> 02:55.625
( all cheer )

02:59.583 --> 03:02.125
That's why the buddy system

02:59.583 --> 03:02.125
is so important.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.208
Hiking alone isn't safe,

03:04.250 --> 03:06.291
and you can get more done

03:04.250 --> 03:06.291
with the help of a partner.

03:06.333 --> 03:10.291
Today, we'll use these buddy

03:06.333 --> 03:10.291
bracelets to stay in pairs.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.959
Uh, can I get two volunteers?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.834
How about

03:13.000 --> 03:14.834
me and Blades, Dad?

03:14.875 --> 03:17.125
I wasn't planning

03:14.875 --> 03:17.125
on pairing up the Bots,

03:17.166 --> 03:20.333
but since he's our mascot,

03:17.166 --> 03:20.333
we can make an exception.

03:23.166 --> 03:26.750
( bracelet locks )

03:26.792 --> 03:28.375
Once you lock

03:26.792 --> 03:28.375
these bracelets on,

03:28.417 --> 03:30.792
they magnetically sync

03:28.417 --> 03:30.792
with each other.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.417
So if you get too far

03:30.834 --> 03:33.417
away from your partner--

03:35.291 --> 03:39.041
( beeping )

03:39.083 --> 03:40.500
You're pulled back together.

03:40.542 --> 03:42.667
( crowd murmuring )

03:42.709 --> 03:44.208
Nice.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.667
Think I know

03:44.250 --> 03:46.667
who my partner's gonna be.

03:46.709 --> 03:49.750
In the Lad Pioneer spirit

03:46.709 --> 03:49.750
of making new friends,

03:49.792 --> 03:52.291
all buddies will be

03:49.792 --> 03:52.291
randomly assigned.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.500
Oh, come on!

03:52.333 --> 03:55.500
Now who's grumpy?

03:55.542 --> 03:58.959
Graham, you're buddies with,

03:55.542 --> 03:58.959
Mrs. Neederlander.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.959
I...I am?

04:01.000 --> 04:05.166
And Mr. Pettypaws.

04:05.208 --> 04:06.417
( purring )

04:06.458 --> 04:09.667
Achoo! I'm allergic to--

04:09.709 --> 04:14.083
Achoo! --cats.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.542
( bracelet locking )

04:22.542 --> 04:24.834
George, you're with Timmy.

04:24.875 --> 04:28.208
And Kyle.

04:24.875 --> 04:28.208
You have Corey as a buddy.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.375
I wish I'd

04:28.250 --> 04:30.375
volunteered with you.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.542
Now who knows who

04:30.417 --> 04:32.542
I'll get.

04:32.583 --> 04:36.041
CHIEF:

04:32.583 --> 04:36.041
Hayley, you're with Frankie.

04:36.083 --> 04:39.208
Ugh. Hayley? What are we

04:36.083 --> 04:39.208
gonna talk about?

04:39.250 --> 04:42.291
She's probably never opened

04:39.250 --> 04:42.291
a science book in her life.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.750
( whispering )

04:42.333 --> 04:44.750
Don't worry, Frankie.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.750
She's really nice.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.417
Has to be,

04:44.792 --> 04:46.417
to put up with Kade.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.917
( all laughing )

04:47.959 --> 04:50.667
Aw, didn't you get

04:47.959 --> 04:50.667
the partner you wanted?

04:50.709 --> 04:53.500
Dani, you're with Kade.

04:50.709 --> 04:53.500
What? Uh.

04:53.542 --> 04:57.917
Ah, didn't you get

04:53.542 --> 04:57.917
the partner you wanted? Ha, ha.

04:57.959 --> 05:02.333
Uh, Carin?

04:57.959 --> 05:02.333
You're with me. Hi, I'm--

05:02.375 --> 05:04.917
Chief Charlie. The man

05:02.375 --> 05:04.917
who helped save my nephew.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.250
Thanks for that.

05:06.291 --> 05:07.959
Well, just part of the job.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.208
I worked Police dispatch

05:08.000 --> 05:10.208
on the mainland.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.291
You're kind of

05:10.250 --> 05:12.291
a legend on the force.

05:12.333 --> 05:17.041
Legend? Well,

05:12.333 --> 05:17.041
I'm not that old.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.083
The Chief

05:17.083 --> 05:19.083
is behaving oddly.

05:19.125 --> 05:22.375
Maybe he's just excited

05:19.125 --> 05:22.375
for the hike. I know I am.

05:22.417 --> 05:25.291
Um, Chief?

05:22.417 --> 05:25.291
I still need a partner.

05:25.333 --> 05:29.208
Strange. I thought we had an

05:25.333 --> 05:29.208
even number of people signed up.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.959
My brother Jerry's on his way.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.500
He's usually late, but he always

05:31.000 --> 05:34.500
has a great story why.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.625
(  dramatic theme playing  )

05:36.667 --> 05:38.417
( robot buzzes )

05:42.083 --> 05:45.500
That took care of the

05:42.083 --> 05:45.500
electronics store. Finally.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.500
Last delivery.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.458
JERRY:

05:48.750 --> 05:50.458
Here you go, doc.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.959
Shipment for the

05:50.500 --> 05:52.959
reptile department.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.208
( truck engine starts, fades )

06:00.625 --> 06:02.083
Huh?

06:02.125 --> 06:03.917
But where are the snakes?

06:03.959 --> 06:06.125
( screams )

06:07.417 --> 06:08.667
( hisses )

06:11.834 --> 06:13.500
(  dramatic music playing  )

06:13.542 --> 06:15.208
Wait! You'll-

06:13.542 --> 06:15.208
Jerry! Stop!

06:16.625 --> 06:18.041
( bracelet keys crackling )

06:21.959 --> 06:24.792
CODY:

06:21.959 --> 06:24.792
The Buddy Bracelet Keys!

06:24.834 --> 06:28.667
I'm sorry, Chief. I was

06:24.834 --> 06:28.667
so worried about being late,

06:28.709 --> 06:31.166
I wasn't paying

06:28.709 --> 06:31.166
enough attention.

06:31.208 --> 06:34.917
Whelp, too bad, sis.

06:31.208 --> 06:34.917
Looks like bonding time's over.

06:34.959 --> 06:36.166
Hey Hayley-- Ugh!

06:36.208 --> 06:37.625
( both bracelets beeping )

06:37.667 --> 06:40.583
Hey! How come

06:37.667 --> 06:40.583
these handcuffs still work?

06:40.625 --> 06:44.792
Destroying a key wouldn't unlock

06:40.625 --> 06:44.792
a door. Same for the bracelets.

06:44.834 --> 06:46.667
Wait, you mean-

06:44.834 --> 06:46.667
Ugh. Ugh.

06:46.709 --> 06:49.667
we're stuck

06:46.709 --> 06:49.667
like this forever?

06:49.709 --> 06:53.000
At least until we can find some

06:49.709 --> 06:53.000
way to electronically override

06:53.041 --> 06:54.250
the lock. Whoa!

06:54.291 --> 06:57.834
( beeping )

06:57.875 --> 07:01.000
Enough of this standing around.

06:57.875 --> 07:01.000
My bunions are sore.

07:01.041 --> 07:02.375
( purring )

07:02.417 --> 07:05.083
Dad, I know how

07:02.417 --> 07:05.083
to shut off our bracelets.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.125
The EMP zone.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.125
Tech stops working there.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.208
Technically, the EMP

07:08.166 --> 07:11.208
is reserved for emergencies.

07:11.250 --> 07:12.583
DANI:

07:11.250 --> 07:12.583
Do you have to be so annoying?

07:12.625 --> 07:13.834
I know you are, but

07:12.625 --> 07:13.834
what am I?

07:13.875 --> 07:15.083
You are so immature.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.375
But this might

07:15.125 --> 07:17.375
qualify as one.

07:17.417 --> 07:19.458
A little change

07:17.417 --> 07:19.458
of route, folks.

07:19.500 --> 07:22.250
We'll be hiking

07:19.500 --> 07:22.250
to the end of Old Canyon Road.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.083
Our buddy bracelets

07:22.291 --> 07:25.083
should unlock by then.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.417
( crowd sighs and murmurs )

07:26.458 --> 07:28.458
Thank goodness!

07:28.500 --> 07:32.291
Well, I was afraid Chief was

07:28.500 --> 07:32.291
going to cancel the hike.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.625
Seriously, Cody.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.959
I have nothing

07:38.667 --> 07:40.959
in common with her.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.542
What am I supposed

07:41.000 --> 07:42.542
to talk about?

07:42.583 --> 07:44.125
I don't know,

07:42.583 --> 07:44.125
anything.

07:44.166 --> 07:45.625
Just be friendly.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.834
Uh, so...

07:47.875 --> 07:52.959
Read any good books

07:47.875 --> 07:52.959
on string theory lately?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.291
( groans )

07:56.208 --> 07:59.083
Uh. Do you need a boost,

07:56.208 --> 07:59.083
Mrs. Neederlander?

07:59.125 --> 08:02.750
No. I'm taking

07:59.125 --> 08:02.750
the easy way.

08:02.792 --> 08:06.750
I-I-I'm not so sure we should be

08:02.792 --> 08:06.750
going so far off the trail...

08:06.792 --> 08:11.375
Come on, tenderfoot.

08:06.792 --> 08:11.375
This is a hike, not bridge club.

08:11.417 --> 08:14.667
At least we'll get

08:11.417 --> 08:14.667
to enjoy the outdoors up close.

08:14.709 --> 08:18.667
Ugh. "Enjoy"

08:14.709 --> 08:18.667
is a strong word. Achoo!

08:18.709 --> 08:20.166
( beeping )

08:20.208 --> 08:22.291
Ah!

08:25.166 --> 08:28.542
I just moved to

08:25.166 --> 08:28.542
Griffin Rock. What a place.

08:28.583 --> 08:30.500
Things here are never boring,

08:28.583 --> 08:30.500
are they?

08:30.542 --> 08:33.750
You should've been here the time

08:30.542 --> 08:33.750
it rained macaroni and cheese.

08:33.792 --> 08:36.583
On the bright side,

08:33.792 --> 08:36.583
leftovers for a week.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.083
( both chuckle )

08:38.125 --> 08:40.542
Still, it's good to know

08:38.125 --> 08:40.542
we have someone like you

08:40.583 --> 08:43.083
keeping us safe.

08:43.125 --> 08:45.291
Sir, are you

08:43.125 --> 08:45.291
developing a sunburn?

08:45.333 --> 08:47.959
It's called blushing, Chase.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.750
And it's also

08:48.000 --> 08:49.750
none of your business.

08:49.792 --> 08:52.041
I do not operate

08:49.792 --> 08:52.041
a business.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.166
Or even possess

08:52.083 --> 08:54.166
a permit to own one.

08:54.208 --> 08:56.000
( beeping )

08:56.041 --> 09:00.083
Griffin Rock emergency,

08:56.041 --> 09:00.083
go ahead.

09:00.125 --> 09:01.583
Understood.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.792
Kade, I need you

09:01.625 --> 09:03.792
downtown for a ladder rescue.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.166
A window washer

09:03.834 --> 09:06.166
fell off his rig.

09:06.208 --> 09:08.041
Yes! On my way, Dad.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.083
Well, as fun

09:08.083 --> 09:11.083
as this hike has been.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.500
Where you go,

09:11.125 --> 09:13.500
I go, remember?

09:13.542 --> 09:15.917
Great. Hey, take notes,

09:13.542 --> 09:15.917
you might learn something.

09:15.959 --> 09:17.959
Hmph. Like how not

09:15.959 --> 09:17.959
to behave?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.500
Remind me why your father thinks

09:18.000 --> 09:21.500
the buddy system is a good idea.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.250
( in unison )

09:21.542 --> 09:23.250
It's not!

09:23.291 --> 09:26.291
Oh. Well at least you

09:23.291 --> 09:26.291
agree on something.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:27.834 --> 09:29.542
( screaming )

09:29.583 --> 09:31.583
( sirens blaring )

09:37.208 --> 09:38.500
( yelps )

09:40.500 --> 09:41.792
( beeping )

09:41.834 --> 09:44.542
( gasps )

09:46.417 --> 09:49.709
Stop struggling!

09:46.417 --> 09:49.709
I'm coming up.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.000
( hissing )

09:51.041 --> 09:52.667
( gasps )

09:51.041 --> 09:52.667
Whoa!

09:52.709 --> 09:56.750
Since when are snakes that big?

09:52.709 --> 09:56.750
Quick, grab on!

09:56.792 --> 09:58.792
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:02.458 --> 10:05.250
( Kade grunts )

10:05.291 --> 10:08.834
( hisses and rattles)

10:08.875 --> 10:10.375
Kade! The snake's

10:08.875 --> 10:10.375
getting away!

10:10.417 --> 10:12.458
Kind of busy

10:10.417 --> 10:12.458
right now, sis!

10:12.500 --> 10:14.000
So multitask!

10:14.041 --> 10:16.375
Well you could do something

10:14.041 --> 10:16.375
to help, you know.

10:16.417 --> 10:18.166
Kade, step back.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.291
Oh, that--

10:18.208 --> 10:20.291
Now you're giving me orders too?

10:20.333 --> 10:22.417
No. Dani, don't move.

10:22.458 --> 10:25.375
Stay out of this,

10:22.458 --> 10:25.375
Heatwave.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.417
( rattling and hissing )

10:31.375 --> 10:33.375
( snake rattling and hissing )

10:36.625 --> 10:41.583
Back away, slowly.

10:41.625 --> 10:43.834
( beeping )

10:46.834 --> 10:48.083
( both scream )

10:48.125 --> 10:50.875
Thanks, Heatwave.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.875
Seriously.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.667
You can thank me by telling me

10:50.917 --> 10:53.667
where I can put this thing.

10:53.709 --> 10:56.333
It feels so...ugh.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.667
Wait, wait, wait,

10:57.709 --> 10:59.250
you're saying

10:57.709 --> 10:59.250
giant alien robots

10:59.291 --> 11:00.709
are afraid of

10:59.291 --> 11:00.709
snakes?

11:00.750 --> 11:02.583
Not afraid. They just...

11:02.625 --> 11:05.250
grate on my metal, ugh.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.250
There should be some

11:05.291 --> 11:07.250
heavy-duty bags

11:07.291 --> 11:08.625
in the emergency kit.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.583
Help! There's

11:08.667 --> 11:11.583
a snake hitchhiker!

11:11.625 --> 11:13.250
Help!

11:13.291 --> 11:14.709
( hissing )

11:18.375 --> 11:20.083
MR. SHARMA:

11:18.375 --> 11:20.083
Snakes!

11:20.125 --> 11:23.000
( people scream )

11:23.041 --> 11:25.125
Weirdest coincidence

11:23.041 --> 11:25.125
ever, or--

11:25.166 --> 11:27.291
We better

11:25.166 --> 11:27.291
let Dad know.

11:28.542 --> 11:30.583
CHIEF:

11:28.542 --> 11:30.583
An attack of giant snakes?

11:30.625 --> 11:32.709
DANI ( over radio ):

11:30.625 --> 11:32.709
We're not sure how many

11:30.625 --> 11:32.709
there are.

11:32.750 --> 11:34.667
Normally I could fly up and

11:32.750 --> 11:34.667
do recon but the--

11:34.709 --> 11:36.625
Your helicopter

11:34.709 --> 11:36.625
is on our hike.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.166
Hold up, troop.

11:38.208 --> 11:40.458
Cody, your sister

11:38.208 --> 11:40.458
needs her Bot.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.208
And since you two

11:40.500 --> 11:42.208
come as a set--

11:42.250 --> 11:44.709
Got it, Dad.

11:42.250 --> 11:44.709
Robot, transform!

11:46.583 --> 11:49.583
Uh, use the robot's

11:46.583 --> 11:49.583
autopilot recall setting, son.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.625
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:57.000 --> 12:01.542
Great, now I really have

11:57.000 --> 12:01.542
nobody to talk to.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.333
DANI:

12:01.583 --> 12:04.333
Let us know if you spot

12:01.583 --> 12:04.333
any more snakes.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.875
We'll chase 'em down.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.875
We will?

12:06.917 --> 12:09.291
Um, what's wrong, Blades?

12:09.333 --> 12:12.458
I can't believe I'm missing my

12:09.333 --> 12:12.458
first ever Lad Pioneer Hike

12:12.500 --> 12:14.500
to go searching for

12:12.500 --> 12:14.500
serpents!

12:14.542 --> 12:17.917
Well, at least it'll count

12:14.542 --> 12:17.917
towards your reptile care patch.

12:17.959 --> 12:21.166
Really?

12:17.959 --> 12:21.166
Then bring on the snakes!

12:21.208 --> 12:25.041
Why don't we start at the zoo?

12:21.208 --> 12:25.041
Maybe they escaped from there.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.500
( sirens blaring )

12:27.542 --> 12:29.417
( Heatwave groans )

12:29.458 --> 12:32.041
Can you stop that thing from

12:29.458 --> 12:32.041
squirming around back there?

12:32.083 --> 12:33.291
( hissing )

12:33.333 --> 12:34.583
Sorry, Heatwave,

12:34.625 --> 12:36.166
that's kind of what

12:34.625 --> 12:36.166
snakes do.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.083
Better get used to it,

12:36.208 --> 12:39.083
about to bag another one.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.875
(  groans  )

12:40.917 --> 12:42.917
( hissing )

12:45.625 --> 12:47.625
I'm coming over,

12:45.625 --> 12:47.625
hold it steady!

12:50.250 --> 12:52.250
Argh!

12:53.625 --> 12:56.750
Argh!

12:53.625 --> 12:56.750
Go, Heatwave!

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
( beeping )

13:01.542 --> 13:05.041
Ha, maybe we should

13:01.542 --> 13:05.041
use these things more often.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.375
BOTH: Nah.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.375
CODY ( over radio ):  Guys!

13:08.417 --> 13:10.375
I found out where

13:08.417 --> 13:10.375
the snakes came from!

13:10.417 --> 13:12.667
The Zookeeper is missing

13:10.417 --> 13:12.667
a shipment of twelve large

13:12.709 --> 13:14.542
and possibly venomous

13:12.709 --> 13:14.542
reptiles!

13:14.583 --> 13:16.917
That leaves

13:14.583 --> 13:16.917
ten more to catch.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.667
HEATWAVE:

13:16.959 --> 13:19.667
You're not putting 'em all

13:16.959 --> 13:19.667
in my backseat.

13:19.709 --> 13:21.750
Reports are coming in

13:19.709 --> 13:21.750
from all over.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.500
Snakes downtown,

13:21.792 --> 13:24.500
in the park, in a pool--

13:24.542 --> 13:26.166
That's an all-hands

13:24.542 --> 13:26.166
emergency.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.959
But some of our hands

13:26.208 --> 13:28.959
are already attached.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.417
I don't suppose you'd mind

13:29.000 --> 13:31.417
going on a ride-along?

13:31.458 --> 13:33.917
In a state-of-the-art

13:31.458 --> 13:33.917
robot squad car?

13:33.959 --> 13:35.458
Can we run the siren?

13:35.500 --> 13:37.166
I'll see what I can do.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.834
Graham, rendezvous

13:40.333 --> 13:42.834
on Cody's coordinates.

13:42.875 --> 13:44.542
Hayley!

13:44.583 --> 13:45.875
An emergency's

13:44.583 --> 13:45.875
come up.

13:45.917 --> 13:47.500
Can you take over

13:45.917 --> 13:47.500
leading the hike?

13:47.542 --> 13:51.291
I teach kindergarten.

13:47.542 --> 13:51.291
This'll be a piece of cake.

13:55.917 --> 13:59.583
So, those flowers

13:55.917 --> 13:59.583
sure are pretty, huh?

13:59.625 --> 14:01.709
I've always loved

13:59.625 --> 14:01.709
Lupinus perennis--

14:01.750 --> 14:06.000
Uh, wild lupine.

14:01.750 --> 14:06.000
So do butterflies.

14:06.041 --> 14:08.083
Some even eat this

14:06.041 --> 14:08.083
when they're caterpillars.

14:08.125 --> 14:11.000
Whoa...

14:08.125 --> 14:11.000
How do you know that?

14:11.041 --> 14:12.625
I have a degree in botany.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.291
Oh, watch out for the

14:12.667 --> 14:15.291
Toxicodendron pubescens!

14:15.333 --> 14:19.417
I thought only my Dad

14:15.333 --> 14:19.417
spoke in random Latin.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.625
Sorry, poison oak.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.875
I learned plants by their

14:21.667 --> 14:23.875
scientific names.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.041
Hope I'm not too boring

14:23.917 --> 14:26.041
of a hiking partner.

14:26.083 --> 14:30.792
Are you kidding?

14:26.083 --> 14:30.792
You can be my tour guide.

14:30.834 --> 14:32.166
What's this?

14:34.083 --> 14:36.000
( purring )

14:36.041 --> 14:38.750
( sneezes )

14:38.792 --> 14:41.625
Mr. Pettypaws sure likes

14:38.792 --> 14:41.625
to shed, doesn't he.

14:41.667 --> 14:45.500
I'm hot. This seat has

14:41.667 --> 14:45.500
no lumbar support.

14:45.542 --> 14:48.500
How do you make it

14:45.542 --> 14:48.500
recline?

14:48.542 --> 14:49.959
( hisses )

14:50.000 --> 14:52.917
Ugh. You call this

14:50.000 --> 14:52.917
a high-tech machine?

14:52.959 --> 14:56.041
I've ridden golf carts

14:52.959 --> 14:56.041
that are more tricked out.

14:56.083 --> 14:58.709
( sniffs )

14:56.083 --> 14:58.709
Tell me we're close, Cody.

14:58.750 --> 15:02.083
Sounds like Graham needs

14:58.750 --> 15:02.083
rescuing from this rescue.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.834
Just head for

15:02.125 --> 15:03.834
Griffin Rock Park, Graham.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.417
But be careful, there's

15:03.875 --> 15:06.417
a King Cobra on the loose.

15:06.458 --> 15:09.834
Snakes can be royalty?

15:06.458 --> 15:09.834
Oh--

15:09.875 --> 15:11.417
Is this another one

15:09.875 --> 15:11.417
of those names

15:11.458 --> 15:12.750
that don't make

15:11.458 --> 15:12.750
any sense,

15:12.792 --> 15:14.875
like

15:12.792 --> 15:14.875
catfish or Moon Unit?

15:14.917 --> 15:18.000
CHIEF:

15:14.917 --> 15:18.000
Cody, we're closing in,

15:14.917 --> 15:18.000
which building has the boa?

15:18.041 --> 15:19.792
The tall one on Waverly,

15:18.041 --> 15:19.792
Dad.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.417
Chief, is this a code one,

15:21.458 --> 15:23.208
or should I 10-12

15:21.458 --> 15:23.208
with my passenger

15:23.250 --> 15:25.125
while you investigate

15:23.250 --> 15:25.125
the 10-64?

15:25.166 --> 15:27.625
10-18. You guys don't have

15:25.166 --> 15:27.625
to worry about me.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.500
I was a 10-37,

15:27.667 --> 15:29.500
remember?

15:29.542 --> 15:32.166
10-4, ma'am, I was unaware

15:29.542 --> 15:32.166
you knew police codes.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.125
Thank you.

15:32.208 --> 15:34.125
10-2.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.375
Polite and capable,

15:34.166 --> 15:37.375
now that's good technology.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.625
( bang )

15:39.667 --> 15:41.125
( grunts )

15:41.166 --> 15:42.834
Chase, open the door.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.417
I cannot, sir, it appears

15:42.875 --> 15:46.417
I am being boa constricted!

15:46.458 --> 15:49.667
( snake hissing )

15:49.709 --> 15:51.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:56.625 --> 15:59.000
Cease and desist, serpent,

15:56.625 --> 15:59.000
you are engaging in

15:59.041 --> 16:02.291
pre-meditated hugging

15:59.041 --> 16:02.291
of an officer of the law.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.208
Chase, try

16:02.333 --> 16:04.208
to transform.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.291
( grunting )

16:06.333 --> 16:10.417
Impossible, sir. My mid-section

16:06.333 --> 16:10.417
is too compacted.

16:10.458 --> 16:13.166
We can ride this out.

16:10.458 --> 16:13.166
No way a Boa is stronger

16:13.208 --> 16:15.500
than your bot.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.166
Dad, help is on the way!

16:18.208 --> 16:20.208
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:24.041 --> 16:26.709
BLADES:

16:24.041 --> 16:26.709
You need to cut my friend

16:24.041 --> 16:26.709
some slack.

16:30.917 --> 16:32.333
Yes, Noble!

16:32.375 --> 16:35.125
Uh huh, we did it!

16:35.166 --> 16:38.291
Something's tickling

16:35.166 --> 16:38.291
my tummy.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.458
Aah! Get it off,

16:40.291 --> 16:42.458
get it off!

16:42.500 --> 16:44.667
(  tense theme playing  )

16:44.709 --> 16:47.333
( thud )

16:47.375 --> 16:48.834
( hisses )

16:48.875 --> 16:50.959
Well, the good news is,

16:48.875 --> 16:50.959
it's gone.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.917
Bad news is, we dropped it where

16:51.000 --> 16:53.917
the Lad Pioneers are hiking.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.542
(  gasps  )

16:55.583 --> 16:57.417
Rescue Team, there's a

16:55.583 --> 16:57.417
giant boa constrictor

16:57.458 --> 16:59.458
on the loose at the

16:57.458 --> 16:59.458
end of Old Canyon Road.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.917
Roger that, Cody.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.917
After we bag this baby,

17:01.959 --> 17:03.792
there should be only

17:01.959 --> 17:03.792
two more snakes out there.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.542
Now you see that?

17:06.500 --> 17:08.542
When you two stop arguing

17:08.583 --> 17:11.333
and work together,

17:08.583 --> 17:11.333
you actually accomplish things.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.542
We could have done it

17:11.375 --> 17:13.542
a lot faster, if Dani hadn't

17:13.583 --> 17:15.417
kept dropping her net.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.417
Me?

17:15.458 --> 17:17.125
You were the one

17:15.458 --> 17:17.125
who was too scared

17:17.166 --> 17:19.417
to get in the water

17:17.166 --> 17:19.417
with that thing.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.792
Forget I said anything.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.083
How long is this

17:25.125 --> 17:27.083
gonna take?

17:27.125 --> 17:30.250
We'll go back as soon as I find

17:27.125 --> 17:30.250
the snake, Mrs. Needer--

17:30.291 --> 17:31.709
( hissing )

17:31.750 --> 17:33.834
Lan-der.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.250
No, Boulder.

17:35.291 --> 17:39.208
Any movement,

17:35.291 --> 17:39.208
and the snake could attack.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.417
( hisses )

17:41.458 --> 17:46.375
( whispers )

17:41.458 --> 17:46.375
Think...calm...thoughts.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.875
( Mrs. Neederlander

17:46.417 --> 17:48.875
playing flute )

18:02.875 --> 18:04.291
That was amazing!

18:04.333 --> 18:06.375
I didn't know you could

18:04.333 --> 18:06.375
charm snakes.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.250
You never asked.

18:06.417 --> 18:09.250
Now let's go.

18:09.291 --> 18:12.083
I think she could have scared

18:09.291 --> 18:12.083
that snake off

18:12.125 --> 18:13.834
without the flute.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.542
( all gasp )

18:18.583 --> 18:21.709
Don't worry, everyone,

18:18.583 --> 18:21.709
that's a boa.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.291
It's not

18:21.750 --> 18:23.291
poisonous.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.000
( hisses )

18:25.041 --> 18:27.834
But it is very good at

18:25.041 --> 18:27.834
swallowing things whole.

18:30.291 --> 18:33.542
Quickly, stay close to

18:30.291 --> 18:33.542
your buddy and move over there.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:38.875 --> 18:40.875
( hisses )

18:42.333 --> 18:44.333
How did you know that

18:42.333 --> 18:44.333
would work?

18:44.375 --> 18:47.417
This is wild garlic.

18:44.375 --> 18:47.417
Some say it repels snakes.

18:47.458 --> 18:51.417
That settles it, I have got

18:47.458 --> 18:51.417
to learn more about plants.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.458
( engine revs )

18:55.667 --> 18:58.250
Graham said he caught

18:55.667 --> 18:58.250
the cobra, Dad.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.375
This is

18:58.291 --> 19:00.375
the last snake left.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:03.083 --> 19:05.000
Rescue Bots,

19:03.083 --> 19:05.000
robot mode.

19:22.125 --> 19:24.208
Ah, my buddy bracelet!

19:25.959 --> 19:27.166
( beeping )

19:27.208 --> 19:30.542
( screams )

19:30.583 --> 19:32.417
We have to deactivate

19:30.583 --> 19:32.417
those bracelets.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.959
Wait, Dad,

19:32.458 --> 19:34.959
maybe they can help.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.792
Heatwave, put Cody

19:35.000 --> 19:36.792
in the tank.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.208
( beeping )

19:59.333 --> 20:00.959
KADE: Whoa.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.959
CHIEF: Oh, thank goodness.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.917
( engine revs )

20:06.125 --> 20:10.291
I knew it. You drove so slow,

20:06.125 --> 20:10.291
we missed the entertainment.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.125
(  upbeat theme playing  )

20:26.792 --> 20:28.750
( hisses )

20:28.792 --> 20:33.000
Ugh, I think I've had enough

20:28.792 --> 20:33.000
nature for one day.

20:33.041 --> 20:36.792
I thought being a Lad Pioneer

20:33.041 --> 20:36.792
involved mostly arts and crafts.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.417
Hey Frankie, wanna go back

20:44.000 --> 20:47.417
to the lab and shoot some hoops?

20:47.458 --> 20:48.750
Maybe later,

20:47.458 --> 20:48.750
Cody.

20:48.792 --> 20:51.667
Hayley invited me

20:48.792 --> 20:51.667
to see her garden.

20:53.834 --> 20:56.834
Whew, thought I'd

20:53.834 --> 20:56.834
never be free.

20:56.875 --> 20:59.166
MRS. NEEDERLANDER:

20:56.875 --> 20:59.166
Not yet, you're not.

20:59.208 --> 21:02.291
Say bye-bye

20:59.208 --> 21:02.291
to Mr. Pettypaws.

21:02.333 --> 21:06.750
( sniffs, sneezing )

21:07.667 --> 21:08.959
( meows )

21:09.000 --> 21:11.250
Okay, Dad,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.250
you're the last pair.

21:11.291 --> 21:14.500
Actually, we never got

21:11.291 --> 21:14.500
much of a hike.

21:14.542 --> 21:17.542
And since we're still

21:14.542 --> 21:17.542
wearing our bracelets--

21:17.583 --> 21:20.375
Lock up for me,

21:17.583 --> 21:20.375
would you, Dani?

21:20.417 --> 21:22.792
What do you think

21:20.417 --> 21:22.792
that was about?

21:22.834 --> 21:24.625
I believe I know...

21:24.667 --> 21:26.417
none of our business.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.458
(  mellow theme playing )

21:32.250 --> 21:34.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )
