WEBVTT

01:40.934 --> 01:42.570
I'll get it.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.385
Dr. Adler?

01:57.451 --> 01:59.187
Can I have a word?

02:02.089 --> 02:03.524
Of course.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.238
I, uh...

02:17.305 --> 02:20.574
I didn't know you made
house calls, doctor.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.910
You know why I'm here,
John.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.284
Gerry, my boy, he's--

02:30.351 --> 02:32.720
he-- he hasn't shown
any symptom--

02:32.786 --> 02:34.288
I mean, not one--

02:34.355 --> 02:36.089
in the past five days.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.592
I told you he is not
going to get any better.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.128
But he's not getting worse.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.596
Is he, doc?

02:42.663 --> 02:44.898
I mean, not yet.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.237
Please...

02:49.237 --> 02:51.972
just give me more time.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.674
You don't need me
to tell you.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.977
Withholding his diagnosis
is a crime against the state.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.613
Look, I sat on this

02:59.680 --> 03:01.482
n-not just because
of who you are

03:01.549 --> 03:03.384
but because Helen
and Alice are friends.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.453
I-- I appreciate that.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.121
I understand. It's hard.

03:08.256 --> 03:10.358
The hardest thing
a father could ever do.

03:10.424 --> 03:13.727
My heart aches for you.
It really does.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.095
But...

03:15.162 --> 03:19.166
the boy is defective.

03:19.267 --> 03:22.336
And there are reporting
requirements.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.772
If I don't submit records
to the Health Office,

03:24.838 --> 03:27.441
questions will be raised.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.677
I'm-- I'm sorry, John.

03:29.743 --> 03:33.381
But if you don't take care
of this today...

03:34.648 --> 03:36.284
I'll have to do it tomorrow.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.623
Herr Blake.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.391
Sieg heil.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.059
Reichsminister Heusmann

04:22.062 --> 04:23.831
Does he, now?

04:46.354 --> 04:48.356
Josef.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.425
Sieg heil.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.362
Hmm.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.769
I'd like to show you
something.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.208
You've heard
of Advantropa, ja?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.743
No.

05:11.178 --> 05:14.114
When completed, it will
dam the Mediterranean Sea

05:14.181 --> 05:16.517
between Gibraltar
and Morocco.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.452
Billions of kilowatts
of electricity

05:18.519 --> 05:20.120
will be generated.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.590
Its waters
will be desalinated

05:22.656 --> 05:24.825
and used to irrigate
the Sahara Desert,

05:24.892 --> 05:27.928
creating millions of
hectares of farmland

05:27.995 --> 05:30.063
to feed a hungry continent.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.433
It's exciting, isn't it,

05:32.500 --> 05:34.935
what we can accomplish
here in the Reich?

05:37.237 --> 05:38.639
I suppose.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.412
You look a great deal
like your mother.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.080
You remember
what she looks like?

05:48.616 --> 05:51.785
I understand how difficult
this must be for you, Josef.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.322
And I appreciate
your coming.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.191
I was ordered to come,
sir.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.093
No one's told me why.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.463
Obergruppenführer Smith

06:02.530 --> 06:04.164
made me aware of your
service to the Reich,

06:04.231 --> 06:07.134
and I was favorably
impressed.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.137
I don't report to
Obergruppenführer
Smith anymore.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.639
I see.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.441
You're your own man
now, ja?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.742
I've always been my own man.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.209
Had to be growing up,
you know.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.045
It was just me and my mother.

06:18.111 --> 06:22.282
You have every right
to be angry with me, Josef,

06:22.349 --> 06:24.217
based on your understanding.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.019
My understanding?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.728
I had hoped to spend
the entire morning together,

06:34.795 --> 06:37.798
but something has come up.

06:37.865 --> 06:42.335
But there is a small gathering
at my home this evening.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.305
Could we continue
this conversation then?

06:45.372 --> 06:47.040
Do I have a choice?

06:48.942 --> 06:49.877
Heil Hitler.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.480
Heil Hitler.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.625
The Yakuza?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.660
You shouldn't
have done that, Frank.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.529
If I hadn't, you'd
be dead right now.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.099
There are worse things.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.502
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.504
There's, uh...

07:18.305 --> 07:19.406
There's something else.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.341
What?

07:21.408 --> 07:24.077
I got this from Jules.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.245
From Mexico?

07:25.312 --> 07:27.114
She didn't say
where she went.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.650
I'm pretty sure
it wasn't Mexico.

07:34.321 --> 07:35.589
So where is she?

07:35.656 --> 07:37.925
The last thing I knew,
she was with him--

07:37.991 --> 07:38.792
the Nazi.

07:38.859 --> 07:41.161
No. That doesn't make sense.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.530
She wouldn't do that.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.364
There's got to be
another explanation.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.866
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.769
None of it does.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.305
Why don't we go back
to your place and get some--

07:52.372 --> 07:54.708
I'm not going back there.
I can't ever go back.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.209
- Frank--
- It stinks, Ed.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.546
This whole damn city
just stinks.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.180
It's lousy with pollens.

08:01.749 --> 08:04.051
What are we going to do
about the Yakuza?

08:08.789 --> 08:11.992
We just bide time.
We'll figure it out.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.345
If you're going to sell
my life to the Yakuza,

08:32.412 --> 08:34.715
the least you could do
is bother to show up.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.952
No. Wait. Please.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.020
It's just--

08:42.122 --> 08:43.591
You understand?

08:43.624 --> 08:46.293
Our first payment
is due in seven days.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.830
Seven days.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.607
All right, let's start
with the high value artifacts.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.341
I like the way
you think.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.177
I've already selected
a few likely candidates
for reproduction.

09:04.244 --> 09:08.616
A buyer in Yokohama wrote
specifically for this piece.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.117
It's Custer's Tiffany sword,

09:10.183 --> 09:11.619
given to him when he
was made general.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.753
No. Too detailed.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.487
It would take me
at least a month.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.057
All right. Uh...

09:17.124 --> 09:19.526
a quaint artifact
from Negro history:

09:19.627 --> 09:21.294
the trumpet
Louis Armstrong used

09:21.361 --> 09:24.097
when he recorded
"Lazy River" in 1931.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.066
Sure, if you can get me
a hydraulic system

09:26.133 --> 09:27.801
to bend the main tube.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.374
What about this?

09:34.441 --> 09:35.676
The cufflink
Abraham Lincoln wore

09:35.743 --> 09:36.944
the night he was
assassinated.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.378
How much
could you hock it for?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.648
I'm a reputable salesman,
Mr. Frink.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.349
I do not hock.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.550
How much?

09:43.651 --> 09:46.253
To the right buyer,
25-30,000.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.256
All right, so I make two.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.691
Mm. No, no.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.061
Just locating one would
be the prize of a lifetime.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.630
To find the pair, it would
raise too much suspicion.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.366
Old Abe had two sleeves,
didn't he? It's a set.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.235
And we need that money fast.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.337
You live here, right?

10:04.404 --> 10:05.639
Why? Wait a minute.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.074
Where are you going?
Excuse me.

10:09.209 --> 10:13.714
Uh, w-- This is
my home, Mr. Frink,

10:13.781 --> 10:15.415
and strictly off limits.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.784
How's the ventilation?

10:16.850 --> 10:17.985
I beg your pardon?

10:18.051 --> 10:19.519
Hello.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.620
Yeah. back here, Ed.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.222
Ed? Who the hell is Ed?

10:22.289 --> 10:23.323
My assistant.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.892
Your assistant?
The assistant?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.559
The one who got us
into this mess?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.461
Here's the stuff you wanted.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.563
Thanks. Ed, this is Childan.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.300
Oh, hey.
Pleasure to meet you.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.467
It's Mr. Childan.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.136
And get that
off my Hepplewhite

10:36.203 --> 10:37.137
right this instant.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.571
What? The table?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.842
I don't know what you think
you're doing here, Mr. Frink,

10:41.909 --> 10:43.643
but this is completely
unacceptable.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.978
My place isn't safe,

10:45.045 --> 10:46.413
and we have a week
to make two of these.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.348
This isn't--
You can't possibly--

10:48.415 --> 10:49.850
Either we work here,

10:49.917 --> 10:51.719
or you explain to the Yakuza

10:51.785 --> 10:53.954
why we're going to be late
with our first payment.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.192
All right, figure out
the materials we'll
need while I'm gone.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.393
All right.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.129
Hey, where are you going?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.032
We need more tools.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.849
Keep moving.
They'll see you.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.392
What the hell
happened?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.027
The shop was burned.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.829
I'm making sure our people
don't walk into a trap.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.164
I meant with Juliana.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.899
Your people were supposed
to get her to Mexico.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.467
- I'm not at lib--
- You're not going.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.435
I need answers.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.938
Get your fucking
hands off me.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.040
You want to kill me?
Go ahead.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.009
You'd be doing me a favor.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.117
Come with me.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.535
This is Frank Frink.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.670
He wants to know
what happened to Juliana.

12:17.805 --> 12:21.241
- Who is this?
- My name's Gary.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.810
Gary Connell.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.845
Wait. I want to talk
to Karen.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.079
Karen's dead.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.915
Your girlfriend
got her killed.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.850
What are you talking about?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.219
She betrayed
all of us, Frank--

12:32.285 --> 12:34.554
you, Lem, Karen, me.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.123
She let Joe Blake
go with the film.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.558
No. No, no, no. I don't--
I don't believe you.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.893
No?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.033
This is her...

12:48.001 --> 12:50.137
defecting to the Reich
yesterday.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.843
She's in New York
right now.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.296
You know what?
This is your fault.

13:16.363 --> 13:17.264
Our fault.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.966
If it hadn't been
for you people.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.700
and those goddamn films,

13:20.767 --> 13:22.535
none of this
would have happened.

13:24.204 --> 13:25.873
You're right, brother.
I'm sorry.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.374
You know what? No.
I am not your brother.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.775
Yes, you are, Frank.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.577
We are all
on the same side here.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.345
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, what side is that?

13:32.412 --> 13:34.347
The side that stands
against the Japanese.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.049
The side that stands
against the Nazis,

13:36.116 --> 13:37.117
that stands for freedom.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.386
Freedom,
whatever that is.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.721
We heard what happened
to your sister

13:41.788 --> 13:43.390
and her kids.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.062
This is what you do,
isn't it?

13:49.129 --> 13:50.597
You use people's suffering

13:50.663 --> 13:53.466
to turn them
to your lost cause.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.237
Well, I am not signing up
for any causes.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.506
You just look out
for yourself,

13:59.572 --> 14:00.908
is that it, Frank?

14:04.011 --> 14:07.047
Yeah. Yeah,
that's pretty much it.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.585
What do you think?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.588
See where he goes.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.037
Was this the man you saw?

14:30.938 --> 14:32.605
I think so.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.107
His name is George Dixon.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.943
What does he have
to do with Trudy?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.310
He's her father.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.678
Miss?

14:38.745 --> 14:41.949
Excuse me, Miss,
where are you from?

14:41.949 --> 14:43.416
- Hmm?
- None of my business.

14:43.483 --> 14:47.054
I know. I guess I'm
just a little nervous.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.257
I am Hector.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.193
Juliana.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.595
W-We're from Buenos Aires.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.231
What's it like there?

14:58.298 --> 15:01.634
It's not safe, not anymore.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.336
War is coming, you know?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.544
Are you full Aryan?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.981
Full Aryan?

15:13.981 --> 15:17.617
My-- My wife's
grandmother is Aymara,

15:17.684 --> 15:19.552
but her father is Aryan.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.222
We have the birth
certificate to prove it.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.424
That's what counts, isn't it?

15:24.491 --> 15:25.993
Miss Crain?

15:27.727 --> 15:29.362
Here.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.232
Good luck.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.012
Genealogy records?

15:45.078 --> 15:49.082
I don't-- I don't have
any genealogy records.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.883
You don't have any.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.485
No. I'm from
the Pacific States.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.187
They don't keep records
like that there.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.324
I'm going to need you
to get undressed.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.360
Uh, I think
there's been a mistake.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.362
I applied
for political asylum.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.064
Put this on.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.333
I'll be back with
a doctor in a moment.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.773
200 millimeters.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.843
150 millimeters.

16:16.909 --> 16:19.346
High skull with
oval facial form.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.116
Olive complexion with
slight tones of yellow.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.951
Right to left at...

16:25.052 --> 16:26.619
Blue eyes, strong.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.322
- Long hair.
- Brown, slight
tones of yellow.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.157
Under 30.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.391
Is your blood Aryan?

16:31.458 --> 16:32.892
I'm not sure.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.094
Maybe.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.528
Initial assessment
Group 2.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.597
- Assessment Group 3.
- Satisfactory.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.600
Mediterranean trade
facial features.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.435
Full face.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.209
What are all these?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.778
I escaped the Resistance.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.446
They didn't tell you that?

16:53.513 --> 16:55.482
But these are
older scars.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.319
What caused them?

16:59.386 --> 17:02.322
I was hit by a bus
a couple of years ago.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.627
Hold still.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.652
Miss Crain,
I'm Sturmbannführer Raeder.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.355
Going to ask you a few
questions, all right?

17:35.422 --> 17:36.523
All right.

17:38.191 --> 17:41.628
We are aware of the assistance
you gave Joe Blake.

17:41.694 --> 17:44.131
May I please
speak with him?

17:44.997 --> 17:46.233
We are also aware

17:46.299 --> 17:48.135
of your Resistance
activities

17:48.168 --> 17:50.370
in Cannon City
and San Francisco.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.004
I'm not
in the Resistance.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.706
You're not?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.308
No. I was just trying
to find out

17:55.375 --> 17:56.843
why they got
my sister killed.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.846
How many times
were you sexually
involved with Joe Blake?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.182
I'm sorry?

18:02.249 --> 18:03.716
Be specific.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.019
I wasn't sexually involved
with him at all.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.189
That's not the
information we have.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.392
Then the information
you have is incorrect.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.663
What, then, was your motive
for assisting him?

18:16.729 --> 18:19.666
I didn't assist him.
I saved his life.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.869
And I gave him
that film you wanted.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.172
You must already
know that.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.620
You will provide
a full accounting

18:40.687 --> 18:42.655
of your activities
for the past two weeks

18:42.722 --> 18:44.624
since the moment
your sister died.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.294
Every place you went,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.596
every person you met,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.364
everything you saw.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.434
Everything.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.737
Do you understand?

19:06.213 --> 19:07.314
Ahem.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.363
Mr. Walker.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.799
May I have a word?

19:29.969 --> 19:32.272
Arnold? Is someone here?

19:33.973 --> 19:37.244
I am Chief Inspector Kido,
Mrs. Walker,

19:37.277 --> 19:38.911
of the Kempeitai.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.449
Have I intruded,
Mrs. Walker?

19:43.950 --> 19:44.951
No.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.420
Not-- Not at all.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.757
We were just sitting down
to have lunch.

19:52.625 --> 19:56.329
Uh, would you
care to join us?

20:39.205 --> 20:41.240
There was a report
of an incident

20:41.308 --> 20:43.876
in front of your
building yesterday.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.345
Gunshots.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.380
Oh, is that
what that was?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.349
I thought that was
a truck backfiring.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.285
No. As I said,
shots were fired.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.856
Was your daughter here
yesterday?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.993
That depends on which
daughter you mean.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.229
I have two daughters.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.431
Yes, my husband's right.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.933
We have-- I mean,
he has two daughters.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.768
Well, we has--

21:08.835 --> 21:10.403
I am well aware.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.940
I refer to your eldest
daughter

21:14.006 --> 21:15.808
Juliana Crain.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.344
Was she here?

21:19.245 --> 21:21.213
Juliana? Yes.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.716
She was here, sir.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.986
So you offered her
assistance...

21:28.187 --> 21:32.024
before she fled
to the Reich.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.159
What?

21:33.225 --> 21:35.061
Why would she do that?

21:35.127 --> 21:38.798
It is what I am here
to ascertain.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.469
Chief Inspector--

21:44.070 --> 21:47.540
Ever since Trudy
disappeared,

21:47.607 --> 21:49.942
Juliana just
hasn't been herself.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.043
It really shook her up.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.179
They're very close.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.515
I mean,
when she came here,

21:55.582 --> 21:58.117
out of the blue
she was, uh,

21:58.184 --> 22:01.688
strange, upset, talking crazy.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.055
Crazy?

22:04.991 --> 22:08.561
What do you mean exactly?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.097
Uh, well...

22:11.163 --> 22:17.470
I think...it was because
of some films that she saw.

22:20.407 --> 22:22.609
From the, uh...

22:23.710 --> 22:25.077
From whom?

22:32.318 --> 22:34.421
From the Man
In the High Castle.

22:36.989 --> 22:41.761
Whatever he showed her...
upset her very much.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.797
She said it was
a film of this city...

22:45.865 --> 22:49.268
destroyed
after an atomic bomb.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.638
She met him?

22:53.440 --> 22:55.542
The Man In the High Castle?

22:57.009 --> 22:58.445
Yes.

23:02.114 --> 23:03.750
She's not on their side.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.552
You understand
that they were after her.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.719
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Arnold.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.921
When your daughter
calls home,

23:08.988 --> 23:10.657
you will notify me.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.895
If you do not,
I will know.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.646
You failed to account
for your whereabouts

23:33.713 --> 23:35.347
the day you escaped
from the Resistance.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.517
They kept me
in the trunk of a car.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.018
The trunk of a car?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.887
The entire day?

23:40.953 --> 23:43.022
Yes. Look, I'm--

23:43.089 --> 23:45.157
I'm sorry. I haven't--
I haven't slept all night.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.593
I'm really very tired.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.828
Are there many more
questions you need to ask?

23:51.363 --> 23:52.532
Sieg heil.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.907
So these, uh...

24:00.973 --> 24:02.675
these members
of the Resistance

24:02.742 --> 24:04.511
you've named, Miss Crain--

24:04.511 --> 24:08.014
your sister
and her boyfriend--

24:08.080 --> 24:09.749
they're both dead.

24:09.816 --> 24:13.586
Joe Blake's already identified
Lemuel Washington for us.

24:13.653 --> 24:16.022
I also named a woman--
Karen.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.057
Karen Vecchione. Yes.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.993
Shot dead the day
before yesterday

24:21.060 --> 24:22.529
by the Japanese.

24:27.333 --> 24:33.072
So is there anyone living
whose name you can give us?

24:36.208 --> 24:39.178
If there was anyone else
I could identify, I would.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.416
What about the man
who shot at you

24:44.551 --> 24:45.952
when you escaped
from that car?

24:47.587 --> 24:50.757
Surely you can
always describe him.

24:50.823 --> 24:54.561
It was Lemuel Washington
who shot at me.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.897
There was no other man,
not that I'm aware of.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.634
Oh, that is--

25:05.638 --> 25:07.139
disappointing.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.744
We have received a request
from the Japanese authorities

25:11.811 --> 25:15.715
for the immediate return
of Miss Crain, sir.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.652
I know you don't
owe me anything.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.288
I just thought that,
after what I did for Joe,

25:22.354 --> 25:24.290
that I might
be safe here.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.994
Have you finished your
evaluation, Sturmbannführer?

25:28.060 --> 25:30.897
Yes, sir, but there is
a medical issue.

25:32.431 --> 25:34.767
Fractured pelvis.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.737
Two years ago, I was
in a bus accident.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.642
Have you tried to conceive
children since then?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.111
No, sir.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.614
For a woman your age
seeking asylum,

25:47.614 --> 25:49.616
the ability to bear
children is a factor.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.286
You're wrong, Miss Crain.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.791
We do owe you.

26:00.359 --> 26:03.696
We're not going to send you
back to face the Kempeitai

26:03.763 --> 26:06.065
or the Resistance.

26:07.533 --> 26:09.769
A temporary asylum
is approved.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.739
On my authority.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.841
Thank you.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.910
I am Obergruppenführer
John Smith.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.949
Welcome to the Reich.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.322
I'll take those.

26:33.660 --> 26:35.194
Sir,

26:35.261 --> 26:36.362
we don't really believe

26:36.428 --> 26:38.097
that the Reich
owes Miss Crain.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.732
You mean because
she scored so poorly

26:39.799 --> 26:41.233
in so many
of the categories?

26:41.300 --> 26:43.770
She lied about her
relationship with Joe Blake.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.172
They're closer
than she admits.

26:49.408 --> 26:51.010
I'm counting on it, Erich.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.346
Shouldn't I prepare
a full transcript?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.915
No, that won't
be necessary.

26:55.982 --> 26:59.018
I'll take care
of Miss Crain's case myself.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.255
Thank you, Erich.
That will be all.

27:27.613 --> 27:29.716
The Reich isn't
what I pictured.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.352
No?

27:33.419 --> 27:34.987
Everything's so clean.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.290
Well...

27:38.357 --> 27:43.896
we all work together
to pursue the common goal:

27:43.963 --> 27:46.232
a way of life we cherish.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.304
Do you think I might
be able to see Joe?

27:53.472 --> 27:55.407
He's away right now, but...

27:55.474 --> 27:56.776
of course,

27:56.843 --> 27:58.811
when the time's right.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.047
My family and I,
we're, uh,

28:01.113 --> 28:04.183
very fond of Joe,
you know?

28:06.085 --> 28:07.519
Which is...

28:07.586 --> 28:11.657
one reason we want to take
special care of you.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.425
I don't want you
to go to any trouble.

28:13.492 --> 28:14.861
No, I insist.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.663
First we got to make sure
you're safe,

28:17.764 --> 28:19.265
Safe?

28:19.331 --> 28:21.901
From the Resistance.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.669
They're pretty weak here
in the Reich,

28:23.770 --> 28:26.238
but they're not
altogether eradicated

28:26.305 --> 28:28.040
unless I know
where to find them.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.842
They might come
looking for revenge.

28:30.877 --> 28:34.446
Which is why, from now on,

28:34.513 --> 28:37.683
your name will be Julia Mills

28:37.784 --> 28:39.651
from Seattle.

28:39.786 --> 28:41.921
You'll be given
new identity papers,

28:41.988 --> 28:43.790
a personal history
to memorize.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.157
Okay.

28:45.224 --> 28:46.225
Don't worry.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.127
You'll be given
accommodation,

28:48.194 --> 28:49.428
and an allowance

28:49.495 --> 28:51.663
until your application
for permanent citizenship's

28:51.798 --> 28:52.799
granted.

28:52.799 --> 28:53.966
Okay.

28:54.033 --> 28:55.501
I wish there were some way

28:55.567 --> 28:57.169
I could repay your kindness.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.806
Well...

28:59.872 --> 29:01.841
there is one way.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.245
The Man
In the High Castle.

29:09.348 --> 29:13.519
And it is of the utmost
importance that we find him.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.422
If there was...

29:17.689 --> 29:18.624
anything,

29:18.690 --> 29:21.493
any detail,

29:21.560 --> 29:24.463
anything
you could tell us.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.572
But it's...

29:33.639 --> 29:36.175
I know you can't

29:36.242 --> 29:38.410
because you'd have
told us already.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.769
Julia Mills,
meet my better half

30:03.836 --> 30:05.437
Mrs. Helen Smith.

30:05.504 --> 30:06.705
Pleasure to meet you.

30:06.772 --> 30:08.307
Oh, you poor thing.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.843
John didn't give me
all of the details,

30:10.910 --> 30:13.612
just enough to know
that your head must
be spinning.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.581
Good day, Miss Mills.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.549
We'll speak again soon.

30:17.616 --> 30:19.018
Thank you.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.021
Come on with me.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.157
Let me show you
your new home.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.282
It's cute, isn't it?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.384
you're lucky to get
one of the singles.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.553
Most of the other girls
have to share an apartment.

30:54.620 --> 30:55.922
Other girls?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.924
This is a dormitory
for single women.

30:57.924 --> 31:01.093
Would you like tea?
I made some.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.229
Yes. Thanks. That's very kind.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.263
Okay.

31:04.330 --> 31:07.099
How many other girls
live here?

31:07.166 --> 31:09.501
Uh, there's space
for 20 or 30,

31:09.568 --> 31:12.171
but I'm not sure
how many are here now.

31:12.238 --> 31:16.275
Oh. We've thrown
some things into
the closet for you.

31:16.342 --> 31:19.511
There wasn't much time,
so I hope they fit.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.148
And you'll
find some make-up
in the bathroom.

31:24.283 --> 31:25.384
Wow.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.753
This is so much more
than I could have hoped for.

31:27.819 --> 31:28.820
Well,

31:28.955 --> 31:31.123
it's hard work to--

31:31.190 --> 31:33.125
Once you get settled,
you'll be expected

31:33.192 --> 31:35.094
to join some of the
neighborhood committees

31:35.161 --> 31:36.762
and the Nazi
Women's League.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.531
But first you have
to pass the ACT.

31:39.598 --> 31:40.732
What is the ACT?

31:40.799 --> 31:43.069
The Auxiliary
Citizenship Test.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.303
That gives you the right

31:44.370 --> 31:46.105
to stay in the Reich
permanently.

31:47.073 --> 31:49.308
You must be exhausted

31:49.375 --> 31:51.643
after everything
you've been through.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.180
I am a little.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.315
Why don't you come
by the house tomorrow?

31:56.382 --> 31:57.549
Say, 10:00.

31:57.616 --> 32:01.020
We can have coffee and get
to know each other.

32:01.988 --> 32:03.555
- All right.
- Okay.

32:03.622 --> 32:06.292
We're at 5026 Roxboro.

32:06.358 --> 32:10.997
I have left a tuna casserole
in the fridge for you.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.332
But there's a grocer
over on von Braun Street

32:13.399 --> 32:16.002
if you need anything else.

32:16.002 --> 32:17.636
You'll find 50 marks
and some change

32:17.703 --> 32:19.538
in the desk drawer there.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.707
You thought of everything.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.075
I don't know what to say.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.710
Well, that's just it.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.113
You don't have to say
anything.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.647
See, now you're some place

32:28.714 --> 32:31.317
where good people actually
look out for one another.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.288
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.023
Okay.

32:37.023 --> 32:38.290
Okay.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.491
Thanks.

32:41.093 --> 32:43.095
Wait. What about the key?

32:44.130 --> 32:45.431
Oh, there isn't one.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.399
No one locks their doors
around here.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.846
This is the third ship
we've lost to pirates

33:00.912 --> 33:02.248
in as many months.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.751
I offer the Empire's
sympathies, Mr. Brewer,

33:05.817 --> 33:08.054
but why bring
this matter to me?

33:08.087 --> 33:10.056
Because the shipping
lanes off Sri Lanka

33:10.089 --> 33:11.423
are under Japanese control.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.825
It is the duty
of your Imperial Navy

33:13.892 --> 33:14.960
to secure them.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.362
Or to compensate us
if they cannot.

33:16.428 --> 33:19.165
The oceans are vast,
Mr. Cullen.

33:19.231 --> 33:22.101
Piracy plagues us all,
even the Reich.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.338
Forgive me,
Trade Minister.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.474
- General Onoda--
- Excuses, please.

33:28.540 --> 33:32.411
Trade Minister will attend
to you in a few moments.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.714
This way,
gentlemen, please.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.200
You altered my plan.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.634
As Trade Minister,

33:55.701 --> 33:58.170
I'm familiar with trucking
companies and their routes.

33:58.237 --> 34:01.107
I believe that the use
of private trucks

34:01.140 --> 34:04.776
will lessen the risk
of unforeseen dangers.

34:04.843 --> 34:07.913
Risk? Dangers?

34:07.979 --> 34:09.448
To what do you refer?

34:09.515 --> 34:14.120
Transporting
enriched uranium
on public buses

34:14.153 --> 34:15.787
would expose
women and children

34:15.854 --> 34:18.224
to lethal levels
of radiation.

34:18.290 --> 34:21.627
American women and children,
not Japanese.

34:23.595 --> 34:26.398
It may not be necessary.
Consider the alterna--

34:26.465 --> 34:28.134
I know you're well regarded

34:28.134 --> 34:30.035
by the Crown Prince
and Princess,

34:30.136 --> 34:32.138
Tagomi-tai'i.

34:32.171 --> 34:35.541
This is not your area
of proficiency.

34:37.143 --> 34:40.379
Please forgive
my misunderstanding.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.382
I thought it my duties
to offer my--

34:43.449 --> 34:46.552
You are not to question
my orders again.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.187
Is that clear?

35:17.183 --> 35:18.417
Thank you.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.648
Ah, Josef.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.049
Welcome.

35:51.116 --> 35:52.984
Any trouble getting here?

35:53.051 --> 35:54.420
We're sort of smug,
aren't we?

35:54.486 --> 35:56.988
Well, by Berlin standards.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.124
This is to celebrate
the completion

35:59.225 --> 36:02.228
of the konfidenz
at Puntalitalifar.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.264
You wanted me
to see all this.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.599
Is that so wrong? Hmm?

36:07.666 --> 36:10.068
For a father
to show his son

36:10.135 --> 36:11.503
what he's achieved?

36:13.939 --> 36:15.241
Let me introduce you

36:15.241 --> 36:16.875
to some very good
friends of mine,

36:16.942 --> 36:18.109
very dear to me.

36:50.742 --> 36:51.910
Thomas.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.985
What do you say, uh,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.888
you and me
just take the car

37:02.954 --> 37:05.657
and go out to the lake
like we used to?

37:05.724 --> 37:09.328
I can't.
There's a Hitler Youth
meeting this afternoon.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.963
So you'll miss it.

37:12.030 --> 37:13.432
Miss it?

37:13.499 --> 37:15.100
Are you okay, Father?

37:15.166 --> 37:17.703
When I was your age...

37:17.769 --> 37:19.705
Grandpa,
sometimes he'd just--

37:19.771 --> 37:21.307
he'd just keep me
out of school

37:21.373 --> 37:23.975
right down the pond
near our house,

37:24.042 --> 37:26.044
and we'd just fish,
you know?

37:26.111 --> 37:28.480
Me and him, till sundown.

37:30.382 --> 37:31.850
Those are some
of the favorite memories

37:31.917 --> 37:33.018
I've got of my father.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.687
They had cars
back then?

37:35.754 --> 37:37.856
Watch it, Mister.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.491
What do we tell Mom?

37:39.558 --> 37:40.959
It'll be our secret.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.575
Mr. Blake.

37:56.642 --> 37:57.576
Yes?

37:57.643 --> 37:59.010
Oberführer Ernst Schmidt.

37:59.077 --> 38:00.612
Adwehr. It's an honor.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.548
Adwehr. That's
intelligence, right?

38:02.614 --> 38:04.015
Indeed.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.684
I shouldn't mention it,

38:05.751 --> 38:08.219
but I read
the classified briefing

38:08.354 --> 38:10.088
on your mission
in San Francisco.

38:10.155 --> 38:12.724
I just had to say well done.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.559
Thank you.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.462
I particularly enjoyed

38:16.528 --> 38:19.097
your negotiation with
those Negro criminals

38:19.164 --> 38:21.767
on the boat. Ha ha!
It's masterful,

38:21.833 --> 38:24.403
just masterful.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.638
That wasn't a negotiation.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.273
That was an assassination.

38:28.374 --> 38:30.208
Uh, yeah.

38:30.275 --> 38:31.810
How long will you be
in Berlin?

38:31.877 --> 38:34.880
Uh, I'm hoping
we'll see more of you.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.515
Excuse me. Ahem.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.619
Josef?

38:43.021 --> 38:44.390
Is something wrong?

38:44.423 --> 38:45.791
I'm going home.

38:45.857 --> 38:46.792
What happened?

38:46.858 --> 38:48.994
One of your guests
reminded me

38:49.060 --> 38:52.030
of who I am
and who I'm not.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.164
I don't understand.

38:53.231 --> 38:54.566
You wouldn't.

38:54.633 --> 38:55.601
But I've seen the blood

38:55.667 --> 38:57.569
that pays
for this champagne.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.406
And if you think
for a second

39:00.439 --> 39:02.608
that it's going
to make me forget

39:02.674 --> 39:04.710
what you did to my mother...

39:06.812 --> 39:09.781
She died poor, by the way.

39:09.848 --> 39:13.018
Josef, I'm not asking you
to forget anything.

39:13.084 --> 39:17.923
I get it. It was war.
You were here.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.425
We were there.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.626
There's more
to the story, son.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.327
I don't care anymore.

39:22.428 --> 39:23.995
Please. Please stay.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.632
Is that an order,
Reichsminister?

39:27.966 --> 39:30.068
Whatever it is
you need to tell me

39:30.135 --> 39:32.203
to clear your conscience,

39:32.270 --> 39:34.440
I don't want to hear it.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.664
May I have a light?

40:12.644 --> 40:15.113
All these important men
congratulating themselves

40:15.180 --> 40:16.482
on how important they are.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.116
I hate these parties, too.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.118
Nicole Dahmer.

40:24.222 --> 40:25.557
Joe Blake.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.992
Blake? I thought

40:27.058 --> 40:29.595
the Reichsminister
called you "son."

40:29.661 --> 40:31.763
Yeah, well,
I only met him today.

40:33.331 --> 40:36.034
I suppose he hoped to impress
you with all of this.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.136
I'm not from here.
I don't give a shit.

40:39.337 --> 40:40.572
You realize
your father is one

40:40.639 --> 40:42.574
of the most powerful men
in the Reich.

40:42.641 --> 40:45.043
He could get you
anything you want.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.112
Anything he wants to give me,
I don't want it.

40:47.178 --> 40:50.849
So you're the only man
in Berlin without an agenda.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.183
I guess so.

41:01.392 --> 41:02.828
Do you know what?

41:04.596 --> 41:05.931
I believe you.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.733
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.603
So where are you headed?

41:11.670 --> 41:13.071
Back to New York.

41:13.138 --> 41:14.573
And what will you do there?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.441
I don't know yet,

41:16.542 --> 41:19.177
but I want it to be real,

41:19.244 --> 41:20.579
to be honest.

41:20.646 --> 41:22.881
And that's not possible
in Germany?

41:24.716 --> 41:27.185
How long have you been here?

41:27.252 --> 41:28.554
Long enough.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.756
Berlin is much more
than ridiculous parties

41:30.822 --> 41:31.990
and pompous ministers.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.993
It's the engine
that drives the work.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.427
Maybe you're right.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.964
Maybe it's not as honest
as New York.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.067
Or maybe we just need
more honest men.

41:46.805 --> 41:49.140
I'm sorry to see you go,
Joe Blake.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.756
So we're going
to need copper,

42:04.823 --> 42:07.859
metal alloy, and what else?

42:09.060 --> 42:10.228
And yellow gold.

42:10.295 --> 42:12.964
Where are we going to get
that with no money?

42:13.031 --> 42:14.299
I have an idea.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.668
Mr. Frink,

42:16.735 --> 42:18.069
you do not have
my authorization

42:18.136 --> 42:20.171
- to give out this address.
- I haven't.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.372
Is that so?

42:21.439 --> 42:24.109
Well, a man dropped this
off for you,

42:24.175 --> 42:27.145
and he looked...unsavory.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.224
Who is it?

42:39.290 --> 42:40.992
Don't worry about it.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.662
Oh. No. Strange man
showing up

42:43.729 --> 42:45.363
as we're engaged
in criminal acts.

42:45.430 --> 42:46.832
Why would I worry?

43:23.201 --> 43:25.170
Excuse me.
Is this seat taken?

43:26.337 --> 43:27.338
Oh.

43:28.807 --> 43:31.276
Uh, actually,
I was waiting for someone.

43:36.314 --> 43:37.949
For Sarah, right?

43:41.252 --> 43:43.054
You have something for me?

43:54.432 --> 43:56.702
I think there's
been a mistake.

43:56.702 --> 43:58.169
I agree.

43:58.236 --> 43:59.705
We shouldn't be
trusting our lives

43:59.738 --> 44:02.240
to the ex-boyfriend
of a traitor.

44:02.307 --> 44:03.709
But here we are.

44:03.709 --> 44:05.343
I don't know
what they told you,

44:05.410 --> 44:06.945
but you people came to me.

44:07.012 --> 44:09.180
Do you know
how to drive, Frank?

44:09.247 --> 44:12.017
Yeah. Yeah. Why?

44:12.083 --> 44:14.485
Because kempeitai
are about to round up

44:14.552 --> 44:15.754
a dozen innocent people.

44:15.821 --> 44:18.023
What's that
got to do with me?

44:18.089 --> 44:19.424
It's reprisal

44:19.490 --> 44:20.892
for the death
of two Pon cops

44:20.959 --> 44:24.095
shot when your girlfriend
ran away.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.803
Well, that's not my fault

44:31.870 --> 44:34.439
or my problem.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.775
12 people are about to die.

44:36.842 --> 44:40.245
If you can live with that,
enjoy your ramen.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.749
But if you can't...

44:44.883 --> 44:48.019
there's a taxi
parked up the block.

44:48.086 --> 44:50.856
Pick me up outside
in five minutes.

46:36.862 --> 46:38.696
Information.
How may I help you?

46:38.763 --> 46:42.433
Hi, Yes, Uh, I'm looking
for a Joe or a Joseph Blake

46:42.500 --> 46:43.534
in Brooklyn.

46:46.271 --> 46:49.040
I have a Joseph Blake
in Flatbush.

46:49.107 --> 46:50.876
Great. That might be him.

46:50.942 --> 46:52.878
Would you have
a street address?

47:12.730 --> 47:14.599
Can I help you?

47:15.733 --> 47:17.502
Uh, yes. I was just--

47:17.568 --> 47:19.070
Looking for Joe?

47:20.371 --> 47:21.606
Yeah.
How did you know?

47:23.108 --> 47:24.609
You're very pretty.

47:26.811 --> 47:28.713
Well, thank you.

47:28.779 --> 47:31.049
I'm-- I'm Julia Mills,
a friend of Joe's.

47:31.116 --> 47:32.617
Of course you are.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.485
I'm Rita Pierce,

47:34.552 --> 47:36.922
also a friend of Joe's.

47:40.525 --> 47:41.526
Joe's in Berlin.

47:44.629 --> 47:46.031
Berlin?

47:46.097 --> 47:48.533
Yeah, his daddy's some
big cheese over there,

47:48.599 --> 47:51.836
top of the Nazi heap,
close to it.

47:51.937 --> 47:56.074
I guess, uh, Joe smelled
a career opportunity.

47:56.141 --> 47:57.408
Can you blame him?

47:59.945 --> 48:01.112
Um...

48:02.513 --> 48:05.583
just-- Thank you. I'll
just get out of your hair.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.187
He fooled you, too.

48:10.956 --> 48:12.257
I'm sorry.

48:35.380 --> 48:40.618
Everyone, please stay at your
stations and cooperate.

49:00.271 --> 49:03.008
May I ask, sir,
what is this about?

49:05.510 --> 49:06.744
And you go, too.

49:19.857 --> 49:21.359
Where's Gary and Lem?

49:21.426 --> 49:22.927
Stay in the car
and keep the engine running.

49:23.028 --> 49:25.363
When she shooting
stops, we need to get
out of here fast.

49:25.430 --> 49:26.197
Shooting?

49:39.844 --> 49:41.146
Please.

49:41.212 --> 49:42.847
Let them go!

49:51.056 --> 49:52.623
Put the knife down!

50:01.299 --> 50:02.600
Everybody stay put.

50:02.667 --> 50:04.102
We're going to get you
out of here.

50:04.169 --> 50:05.436
Where are the keys at?

50:06.304 --> 50:08.273
Keys. We need keys.

50:21.786 --> 50:23.054
Shoot him.

50:23.121 --> 50:25.123
Let her go!

51:08.032 --> 51:09.200
Come on.

51:39.697 --> 51:41.166
You had no choice

51:41.232 --> 51:43.368
but to approve the general's
plan, Trade Minister,

51:43.434 --> 51:47.405
but perhaps you will
find another way
to change his mind.

51:47.472 --> 51:49.640
The general's
not interested

51:49.707 --> 51:52.843
in changing his mind,
Kotomichi.

51:52.910 --> 51:54.712
He made that clear.

52:00.518 --> 52:02.953
If innocent civilians die,

52:03.020 --> 52:05.356
it will not be your doing.

52:09.194 --> 52:11.396
When they die...

52:13.298 --> 52:28.979
it will be because I
failed to prevent it.

52:29.046 --> 52:31.449
We'd just be
camping over the weekend.

52:31.516 --> 52:32.883
Half the class is going.

52:32.950 --> 52:34.819
I really, really want to go.

52:36.821 --> 52:37.888
Uh-huh.

52:40.024 --> 52:41.292
Mom said to ask you,

52:41.359 --> 52:43.361
since there were girls
coming.

52:43.428 --> 52:46.531
But-- But Bobby's parents
are chaperoning them,

52:46.597 --> 52:49.867
and I would never do anything
to shame our family.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.802
No, I know that.

52:56.241 --> 52:57.942
Of course you wouldn't.

53:02.780 --> 53:03.914
Thomas.

53:05.483 --> 53:07.918
We're all
very proud of you.

53:07.985 --> 53:09.587
Do you know that?

53:10.821 --> 53:11.922
Yeah.

53:13.258 --> 53:14.459
Yeah, I know that.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.428
But there's, um...

53:18.763 --> 53:22.300
there's something
I didn't exactly tell Mom.

53:23.801 --> 53:29.574
There's this girl I like
going, too, and...

53:29.640 --> 53:31.175
maybe...

53:31.276 --> 53:32.877
maybe even more
than like.

53:36.281 --> 53:39.284
She's better than...

54:20.925 --> 54:21.859
John.

54:24.362 --> 54:25.730
You all right?

54:28.399 --> 54:29.600
Let's talk.

54:40.077 --> 54:44.582
I drove Thomas out
to the lake this afternoon.

54:49.387 --> 54:51.389
I'm so sorry, John.

54:55.526 --> 54:57.628
I know you don't
want to hear this, but...

54:59.129 --> 55:00.898
you did the right thing.

55:04.001 --> 55:05.536
I know.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.654
Thank you.

56:37.595 --> 56:38.929
Trade Minister?
