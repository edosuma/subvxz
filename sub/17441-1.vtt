01:41.500 --> 01:42.271
What's that?

01:42.599 --> 01:44.989
- Sounds like a jet, doesn't it?
- That's not jet.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.239
Maggie!  Look!

01:47.641 --> 01:50.451
- What is it?
- Down!  Get down.

01:51.662 --> 01:53.571
Maggie!

01:59.024 --> 02:00.943
Get inside, inside!

02:02.045 --> 02:03.160
Inside!

02:16.029 --> 02:17.274
Maggie!

02:18.170 --> 02:19.364
I'm alright, Dad.

02:19.910 --> 02:22.041
We saw it coming out of
the sky, it was brilliant...

02:22.091 --> 02:23.844
You two stay over there, and
keep watch from the windows!

02:26.652 --> 02:29.549
It's probably a meteor, isn't it?

02:29.784 --> 02:31.081
I hope that's what it is.

02:31.182 --> 02:32.249
Dad, don't go out there!

02:32.284 --> 02:33.769
- You stay here, lad.
- Please, dad, don't go out!

02:33.770 --> 02:36.491
Hang on now!  Is the
telephone still on!  Call the police.

03:23.045 --> 03:24.976
<i>Will you all please
return to your homes.</i>

03:25.346 --> 03:28.285
<i>You're only hampering operations
by crowding the streets.</i>

03:28.527 --> 03:30.519
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

03:30.600 --> 03:33.967
<i>Please get back out of the road,
on to the pavement please.</i>

03:33.976 --> 03:36.921
<i>Come along now, please.
Please return to your homes.</i>

04:03.565 --> 04:04.985
Get back.

04:05.005 --> 04:06.802
People in here.
Right back please.

04:06.846 --> 04:08.179
Right back.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.691
Keep clear!

04:17.589 --> 04:18.696
Alright.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.973
You'll be alright.
They'll take care of you.

04:35.301 --> 04:37.133
Okay George, let's
have a look at you.

04:37.182 --> 04:40.020
Oh, don't you start fussing too.
I've got singed, that's all.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.191
It's still too hot to put water on.

04:43.363 --> 04:44.822
It could do with another pump.

04:45.595 --> 04:47.189
It should be heavily green now.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.358
What's all this about, chief?

04:48.634 --> 04:50.856
It could be practically anything.

05:03.127 --> 05:06.881
The object was first sighted
at about 9:15 this evening.

05:06.967 --> 05:10.883
And its approach was widely
observed over the southern counties.

05:11.330 --> 05:14.048
A statement just issued by the home office,

05:14.090 --> 05:16.930
stresses that there
is no general danger.

05:17.170 --> 05:21.290
Members of the public however are
warned to stay away from the area.

05:21.532 --> 05:22.647
I will repeat that.

05:26.002 --> 05:28.580
The Home Office stresses that
there is no immediate danger.

05:28.583 --> 05:29.768
Do you realize what
you'll have to face

05:29.769 --> 05:31.230
if this turns out to be
a disaster, Quatermass.

05:31.238 --> 05:32.836
- How much further?
- 150 miles, sir.

05:32.837 --> 05:34.047
Quatermass, I'm talking to you!

05:34.048 --> 05:36.610
For the last 20 miles I've
been painfully aware of that.

05:36.614 --> 05:38.403
Well that answered that.  How did
it happen?  What went wrong?

05:38.445 --> 05:40.197
For the first time in
the history of the world,

05:40.198 --> 05:42.992
man has sent a rocket
1500 miles into space.

05:43.027 --> 05:45.035
You can't expect such an
experiment to be perfect.

05:45.036 --> 05:46.470
Well, you must have had some ideas.

05:46.487 --> 05:49.347
I'm a scientist, not a fortune-teller
who predicts what will happen.

05:49.387 --> 05:52.507
- Well you had instrument, radio contact.
- We lost it for over 57 hours. sir.

05:52.742 --> 05:54.840
Poor old Glooseman don't
even know how far it's been.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.300
It had no further contact even
when it return to the orbit.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.217
Yet you brought it down
by your own control.

05:59.218 --> 06:00.869
Well, that's something
to tell your ministry.

06:01.230 --> 06:03.241
Create a mess, set it up
and he brought it back.

06:03.491 --> 06:04.700
Please!  Oh, please.

06:04.705 --> 06:05.940
Couldn't you pick some
other time for this.

06:05.941 --> 06:07.211
I'm sorry, Mrs. Carroon.

06:07.212 --> 06:09.204
I happened to be concerned
with the Ministry of Defense.

06:09.252 --> 06:10.840
And I'm not a civil
servant, I'm a doctor.

06:10.842 --> 06:14.567
And I happened to be concerned with 3
men.  The 3 men who are in that rocket.

06:14.614 --> 06:16.562
Oakley, Green, this is it?

06:17.035 --> 06:18.692
Certainly no secret.

06:23.276 --> 06:24.809
Sorry, no one's allowed past this point.

06:25.156 --> 06:26.849
Ministry of Defense.

06:27.537 --> 06:29.853
Oh, yes, sir.
Alright there, open up.

06:44.101 --> 06:45.592
Sorry Miss, you will have to keep back.

06:45.893 --> 06:47.014
Hoi, Miss!

06:47.221 --> 06:48.779
Hey, you have to get back, please!

06:49.382 --> 06:50.497
Miss!

06:51.222 --> 06:53.214
Hi Ike, chasing the girls again.

06:53.263 --> 06:55.952
Aye, you'd think it bank holiday
the way they come flocking out.

06:56.004 --> 06:57.378
I'd like to flock home.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.827
You stay put, my lad,
until that thing cools off.

06:59.828 --> 07:00.941
Or blows up.

07:01.025 --> 07:03.744
Now don't start that story going
around.  I said it's not a bomb.

07:03.885 --> 07:07.023
- So why can't we put water on it?
- Listen, Charlie. We've had instructions.

07:07.166 --> 07:09.498
Don't ask me why
because I didn't tell us.

07:09.648 --> 07:11.465
Hey, hey.  Just a minute!

07:11.867 --> 07:15.144
- Mr Blake, Ministry of Defense!
- I'll get the inspector.

07:24.230 --> 07:26.461
- Try and get through to them Marsh.
- Right, sir.

07:26.611 --> 07:28.463
Get the temperature reading.

07:31.112 --> 07:33.081
Why don't you go and
wait in the car, Judith?

07:33.131 --> 07:34.370
It's funny.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.311
It looks exactly the same.

07:36.453 --> 07:39.452
Yet it's been, who knows how far.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.624
There isn't a word.

07:41.634 --> 07:43.162
<i>Hello Q-1, hello.</i>

07:48.955 --> 07:51.390
Q-1, Q-1, This is Marsh.

07:51.758 --> 07:53.953
Hello Carroon, Green, Reichenheim.

07:54.198 --> 07:55.756
You receive me?  Over.

07:57.098 --> 07:58.070
Keep trying.

07:58.298 --> 07:59.683
- Mr. Blake?
- I'm Quatermass.

07:59.684 --> 08:01.521
I'll be in charge
from here on inspector.

08:01.579 --> 08:03.475
Can't say I'm sorry about
that.  What's the next move?

08:03.719 --> 08:06.519
We can't do anything right now.
Not until that cools off.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.480
- How long left is that?
- I would say 3 or 4 hours at least.

08:09.721 --> 08:11.668
Q-1, Q-1, this is Marsh.

08:11.703 --> 08:13.273
Can you hear me?  Over.

08:13.308 --> 08:15.074
You keeping them there for four hours?

08:15.223 --> 08:17.199
I suppose you'd like me to
open it up right now, huh?

08:17.443 --> 08:20.202
One blast of air in against
that heat will incinerate them.

08:20.242 --> 08:22.280
Sir, reporters have arrived.
They'd like some facts.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.730
- They'll get some later.
- They'll get some now. Bring them on Major.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.541
Don't you think we ought to find
out a few more ourselves first?

08:26.542 --> 08:27.261
Bring them on, Major.

08:27.262 --> 08:29.199
Are you hearing me Q-1?
Are you hearing me?

08:29.234 --> 08:32.847
This is Marsh calling Q-1.
Q-1, over.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.614
You know, if I ever
gave them all the facts,

08:43.615 --> 08:45.318
you'd find one or two
of them difficult to explain.

08:45.428 --> 08:47.029
Don't try and drag me
through the mud, Blake,

08:47.030 --> 08:49.660
you might splash a little bit on
yourself, you and your committee.

08:49.666 --> 08:52.549
You deliberately launched that rocket
without waiting for official sanction.

08:52.550 --> 08:54.431
If the whole world waited
for official sanction,

08:54.432 --> 08:56.704
it would be standing still.
You took too long.

08:56.705 --> 08:59.130
- I made my own decision.
- To gamble with 3 men's lives!

08:59.131 --> 09:01.779
Every experiment is a gamble.
The unknown is always a risk.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.446
- They should know that.
- Did she know that?

09:03.530 --> 09:05.350
That woman over there
waiting, hoping and praying?

09:05.400 --> 09:07.255
It dropped another 100
degrees since we arrived.

09:07.371 --> 09:08.721
We still got a long way to go.

09:08.831 --> 09:10.728
Let's hope that insulation
lining doesn't crack up.

09:10.729 --> 09:11.628
Yes, let's hope it didn't.

09:11.629 --> 09:13.800
Because if it did, Quatermass and
those 3 men in there are dead...

09:13.803 --> 09:15.263
Dead or alive they'll be heroes.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.146
Let me tell you something, Blake.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.710
They'll fire the imagination
so that there'll be a 100 men

09:19.712 --> 09:22.600
begging for the same privilege
when we launch the second rocket.

09:22.612 --> 09:25.717
- You can't stop it now.
- You mean I can't stop you now.

09:26.447 --> 09:27.763
That's right.

09:28.726 --> 09:30.921
This is Marsh calling Q-1.

09:31.326 --> 09:33.559
Do you hear me?  Over.

09:38.217 --> 09:39.378
There's nothing, sir.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.920
Nothing Quatermass.
You know what you've done.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.910
I launched it and I brought it back,
that's quite an achievement, I think.

09:43.915 --> 09:45.607
- And those 3 men ...
- Quiet!

09:46.531 --> 09:48.704
- What is it, Marsh?
- Something came through.

09:50.615 --> 09:52.616
Pull up. Brian pull up.

09:54.415 --> 09:56.849
The tapping coming from inside.

09:57.095 --> 09:58.768
By the hull, near the transmitter.

09:59.416 --> 10:00.644
Q-1, Q-1.

10:00.896 --> 10:04.584
Green, Reichenheim,
Carroon.  This is Quatermass.

10:05.178 --> 10:07.151
We can hear you, can you hear us?

10:07.498 --> 10:08.649
Over.

10:17.582 --> 10:19.767
Q-1, Q-1, can you hear me?

10:19.802 --> 10:21.242
You've landed in England.

10:21.262 --> 10:25.258
We are here not 50 yards from you.
Are you all right?   Over.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.740
Tapping has stopped.

10:31.906 --> 10:34.098
We can't wait.  We've got to
get them out of there now.

10:34.147 --> 10:35.900
- Bring me the fire chief.
- Right away. sir.

10:36.149 --> 10:37.442
- Set the remote control.
- Are you mad?

10:37.488 --> 10:39.179
Do you know what will happen
if we have no rocket door now?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.715
We've got to take that risk.  We
know one of them is alive in there.

10:41.716 --> 10:42.700
In an hour, he may not be.

10:42.702 --> 10:44.526
But you said that would incinerate
them.  You can't do a thing like that!

10:44.527 --> 10:45.810
Don't tell me what I
can do, what I can't do.

10:45.814 --> 10:47.730
That shell temperature
is still 300 degrees.

10:47.732 --> 10:49.261
Alright.  What would you suggest?

10:49.262 --> 10:52.163
Wait till it's absolutely safe
and then bring him out dead?

10:52.198 --> 10:53.543
- Door control set, sir.
- Hold it.

10:53.793 --> 10:55.049
Where's that fire chief?

10:55.054 --> 10:57.307
Get an ambulance move in.

10:59.036 --> 10:59.849
You want me, sir?

11:00.194 --> 11:02.956
Yes.  Round up every man and
piece of machinery you've got.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.548
Move it in there as close as possible.

11:04.597 --> 11:07.139
We're gonna open the rocket door
from here by remote control.

11:07.517 --> 11:09.118
When the door opens,
when I give you the signal.

11:09.437 --> 11:12.079
I want every hose turned full
force around that entrance.

11:12.120 --> 11:12.936
Now you got it?

11:12.937 --> 11:15.086
Oh, that thing's still as hot
as the base, I don't know.

11:15.103 --> 11:16.120
If you start pumping water ...

11:16.121 --> 11:18.056
Don't argue with me.
I know what I'm doing.

11:18.282 --> 11:19.397
I hope so, sir.

11:19.642 --> 11:20.860
- Major.
- Sir.

11:20.863 --> 11:22.481
I want this whole field cleared.

11:22.722 --> 11:25.462
When they come out of the rocket,
I want absolutely no one on the field.

11:25.463 --> 11:26.520
Do you understand?
No one.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.475
Don't worry, sir.

11:40.007 --> 11:42.490
There's someone alive in there.
We don't know what condition they'll be.

11:42.498 --> 11:45.450
So you better get everything out.
Oxygen, morphine, glucose ...

11:55.289 --> 11:56.680
Well, now it's up to you.

11:56.689 --> 11:59.166
Keep your eye on me.
I'll give you the signal.

11:59.731 --> 12:01.351
- All set?
- Set, sir.

12:01.431 --> 12:02.524
Start it up.

12:02.769 --> 12:04.426
Let me know when you're
minus 10 the pressure.

12:04.627 --> 12:05.798
Right, sir.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.620
Minus ten

12:10.231 --> 12:11.506
Nine

12:12.952 --> 12:14.181
Eight

12:15.634 --> 12:16.748
Seven

12:18.394 --> 12:19.624
Six

12:21.276 --> 12:22.708
Five

12:23.995 --> 12:25.350
Four

12:26.758 --> 12:28.237
Three

12:29.479 --> 12:30.594
Two

12:32.319 --> 12:33.547
One

12:35.041 --> 12:36.154
Zero.

13:16.853 --> 13:18.269
Turn off the water.

13:36.537 --> 13:38.499
- It's Mr Carroon.
- Victor!

13:38.500 --> 13:39.980
- Victor, darling!
- Get them into the ambulance!

13:40.210 --> 13:41.719
- What about the others?
- Darling.

13:49.983 --> 13:51.938
Green! Reichenheim!

13:52.103 --> 13:54.082
What happened son?

13:58.426 --> 14:00.940
The access chamber, there's more inside.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.279
Quick, the manual control.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.946
Where are the others?

14:10.787 --> 14:11.906
This thing works?

14:12.151 --> 14:13.583
It's free, sir.

14:32.215 --> 14:34.850
- They are not there.
- Not there.  What do you mean not there?

14:34.856 --> 14:36.430
I mean they're not in the
rocket, either one of them.

14:36.437 --> 14:39.275
- Oh, that's impossible. They must be!
- He's right, sir.  They're gone.

14:39.317 --> 14:40.991
- The pressure suits?
- Empty.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.043
Still linked.  Helmets are still
attached but they're empty.

14:45.920 --> 14:47.733
How the hell could they
possibly have gone out?

14:47.981 --> 14:50.622
If I knew that I wouldn't be
wasting my time trying to find out.

14:50.881 --> 14:52.400
Go bring the camera down.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.080
Do you think the door opened
and they were swept away?

14:55.083 --> 14:57.393
If the door had opened
it'd be registered here.

14:57.543 --> 15:00.951
No, that door has not
been opened, till now.

15:04.025 --> 15:05.571
What are you just trying to tell me?

15:05.685 --> 15:07.559
I'm not trying to tell you anything.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.245
Let the camera do that.

15:09.748 --> 15:12.846
I'm afraid the camera
can't tell us anything.

15:27.452 --> 15:28.490
Are they all right?

15:28.513 --> 15:30.367
Something happened.
They're not there.

15:33.694 --> 15:34.810
Victor!

15:35.095 --> 15:36.447
Where is Green?

15:36.695 --> 15:37.810
Where's Reichenheim?

15:37.855 --> 15:39.735
- What happened?
- Please, not now.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.151
Quatermass!

15:41.697 --> 15:43.540
He is in no condition to talk.

15:43.558 --> 15:45.325
He's in truth still in a state of shock!
He must be treated.

15:45.327 --> 15:47.245
He's got to talk first.  He's got
to tell me what happened!

15:47.246 --> 15:48.471
Gordon!

15:51.399 --> 15:54.025
What is it Victor?
What is it?

16:12.386 --> 16:14.105
He said "help me".

16:14.507 --> 16:15.780
That's all he said.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.322
"Help me".

16:29.390 --> 16:31.952
SPACE ROCKET :
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENT SUCCESSFUL

16:32.313 --> 16:34.304
ROCKET LANDS AT NIGHT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

16:34.553 --> 16:36.190
WHY THE SECRECY?

16:36.431 --> 16:39.712
QUATERMASS:
NO TO A POLICE INVESTIGATION

16:39.956 --> 16:42.993
METROPOLITAN POLICE
FORENSIC LABORATORY

16:57.063 --> 16:58.600
- You get it?
- Yes, sir.

16:58.605 --> 16:59.693
Good.

17:23.368 --> 17:26.367
Alright, so he's just making any ...
but he got a lump state with the wife.

17:26.403 --> 17:27.582
Any special reason?

17:27.592 --> 17:29.283
Uh huh, my favourite day of the month.

17:29.312 --> 17:32.244
Payday.
Oh, I'm a big man on payday.

17:33.312 --> 17:34.426
Yes, sir.

17:35.892 --> 17:38.562
- See the papers?
- Quatermass?

17:38.714 --> 17:40.432
Still to get up for the police.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.676
How dare he take
fingerprints from a sick man?

17:42.694 --> 17:43.900
There's nothing else they could do?

17:43.907 --> 17:46.074
He couldn't talk, couldn't
answer any questions.

17:46.315 --> 17:47.818
Thought it would be might
as well get his prints.

17:48.394 --> 17:49.525
You never know.

17:49.714 --> 17:51.148
No, you never know.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.190
He's a weird one, alright.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.633
Skin it ...

17:55.120 --> 17:57.764
just like shaking hands
with a piece of ice.

17:58.217 --> 18:01.423
Sergeant, that's no way
to talk about a public hero.

18:02.119 --> 18:03.234
Come in.

18:04.538 --> 18:06.630
A Mr Quatermass to see you, sir.

18:06.639 --> 18:08.991
Well, speaking of public heroes.

18:09.241 --> 18:11.198
- Alright, bring him in..
- Yes, sir.

18:11.561 --> 18:13.227
Quatermass, heh?

18:13.701 --> 18:17.158
This is what's known as
penetrating into enemy territory.

18:21.765 --> 18:23.826
- Inspector Lomax.
- I'm Lomax.

18:23.827 --> 18:25.400
This is Sergeant Best.
Won't you sit down?

18:25.404 --> 18:26.958
I'll come direct to
the point, Inspector.

18:27.163 --> 18:29.438
I will not have your men
coming into my research center

18:29.439 --> 18:32.060
and treating Victor Carroon as though
he were a pathological criminal.

18:32.066 --> 18:33.700
- No, he ...
- He's a sick man, Inspector.

18:33.704 --> 18:36.446
He's been through an ordeal
that very few man could survive.

18:36.487 --> 18:38.799
Two men didn't survive it,
did they Mr Quatermass?

18:38.848 --> 18:41.045
What exactly do you mean by that?

18:41.050 --> 18:42.171
I wish you'd sit down.

18:42.367 --> 18:46.263
If I sit and you stand, I'm being
rude.  I'm longing to sit down.

18:48.890 --> 18:51.441
You see, Mr Quatermass,
I'm an old-fashion sort of chap.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.408
I don't know much about
rockets or travelling in space.

18:53.650 --> 18:56.777
I don't read science fiction,
I'm a plain simple bible man.

18:56.931 --> 19:00.078
I have a routine mind, and
I have to do routine things.

19:00.113 --> 19:02.234
Such as fingerprinting
an unconscious man.

19:02.331 --> 19:05.470
When 3 men take off in a
rocket and only one comes back

19:05.473 --> 19:07.325
in our reckoning that leaves minus 2.

19:07.634 --> 19:11.710
And minus 2 puts us in an embarrassing
position having to investigate plus 1.

19:11.714 --> 19:14.132
Now whether he is conscious,
unconscious or a gibbering idiot.

19:14.176 --> 19:17.145
Fine.  I guess that can save
you a lot of time, Inspector

19:17.146 --> 19:19.027
with your so called investigation.

19:19.062 --> 19:22.400
I have here, the particulars
on all 3 members of the crew.

19:22.838 --> 19:26.614
Charles Green, Ludwig
Reichenheim, Victor Carroon.

19:26.639 --> 19:30.533
You'll find everything there, Inspector.
Medical histories, personal descriptions,

19:30.578 --> 19:34.314
academic achievements, professional
activities, politics and even fingerprints.

19:34.501 --> 19:35.740
Well, that is very thoughtful of you.

19:35.741 --> 19:36.934
There is only one investigation

19:36.935 --> 19:40.231
likely to serve any good purpose
in this situation, Inspector.

19:41.081 --> 19:42.995
That's the scientific one.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.699
I'm sure even you will
agree, that between us,

19:48.700 --> 19:50.839
I am the best qualified
for that assignment.

19:50.964 --> 19:53.257
Good day, Inspector, Sergeant.

19:54.585 --> 19:57.477
Well, we might all well say
we've been given a ride.

19:57.478 --> 19:58.562
Yes, sir.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.845
It's absolutely unbelievable.

20:10.848 --> 20:14.148
It just isn't clinically possible that
his heart should just pump like this.

20:14.150 --> 20:17.421
Pulse, blood pressure the same.
Impossibly low.

20:18.390 --> 20:20.040
He shouldn't be alive but he is.

20:20.051 --> 20:22.110
Can't you do something to
increase the metabolic rate?

20:22.111 --> 20:23.739
Tried everything.
No effect.

20:24.192 --> 20:26.240
I never knew pressure
effects to last this long.

20:26.241 --> 20:27.832
Well, these aren't
just pressure effects.

20:27.872 --> 20:30.914
Take a look at his face,
take a look at the skin.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.927
Anyway, here on the shoulder.

20:33.534 --> 20:34.760
Feel it.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.810
Swollen, coarsened.

20:37.815 --> 20:39.286
Yes, and that's not all either.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.353
Look at the contour of the face.

20:42.695 --> 20:44.390
You mean the bone structure?

20:44.436 --> 20:47.590
Yes, it could be rather limp, but
not about the shape of the bones.

20:47.598 --> 20:50.198
There's been a change,
I'm convinced of that.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.626
Is he any better?

20:53.879 --> 20:55.368
He's coming along fine.

20:56.020 --> 20:58.391
If only he'd say something.

20:58.441 --> 21:01.151
Give us a sign that he's thinking,
that he knows we're here.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.291
He knows, Judith.
He knows we're trying to help him.

21:04.292 --> 21:05.699
What is happening to him?

21:05.700 --> 21:07.003
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

21:07.102 --> 21:08.780
Shouldn't he be in a hospital?

21:10.582 --> 21:13.304
- That's exactly where he should be.
- Briscoe!

21:13.483 --> 21:15.380
I can't take this
responsibility any longer.

21:15.381 --> 21:17.640
I haven't got the proper
equipment here to do the right tests.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.597
He belongs in a hospital.

21:21.445 --> 21:23.215
Well, I suppose you're right.

21:24.364 --> 21:28.358
I suppose you're both right.
He does belong in a hospital.

21:30.027 --> 21:32.141
But can a hospital do
more than you can do?

21:32.308 --> 21:35.420
Would a hospital know what
goes on out there in space?

21:35.428 --> 21:38.216
On the other side of the earth,
it's a whole new would out there.

21:38.251 --> 21:40.479
A wilderness, uncharted.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.583
And he's been there and come back.

21:43.330 --> 21:45.010
He's got the map.

21:45.052 --> 21:47.737
Unlock his mind for me, Briscoe,
and find it.  I know you can do it.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.525
It isn't just the ...

21:48.526 --> 21:50.390
I know the strain and
tension you've been under.

21:50.393 --> 21:54.110
But to stop now, when we're so close.
On the brink of something tremendous.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.130
The very fringe of
some great discovery.

21:56.131 --> 21:57.639
We can't stop now, Briscoe.

21:58.074 --> 22:00.719
Besides, it's our only chance to
learn what happened to the others.

22:00.756 --> 22:02.650
At the hospital you have almost  ...

22:02.653 --> 22:06.055
Does the hospital know how to deal with a
man who's been exposed to rocket radiation?

22:06.097 --> 22:08.400
- It is that she knows that ...
- Or the effects of pressure

22:08.410 --> 22:10.123
at 1500 miles up?

22:10.174 --> 22:13.371
During flight training it took 7 times the
force of gravity without even a headache.

22:13.377 --> 22:15.773
We know that.
But would a hospital know it?

22:26.095 --> 22:28.546
Well, I'll try another
transfusion, see if that will help.

22:32.778 --> 22:33.885
Thanks.

22:34.898 --> 22:36.617
You'll stay with him, won't you Judith?

22:38.180 --> 22:39.527
He needs you.

22:48.183 --> 22:49.499
Victor.

23:10.491 --> 23:13.629
I am going to move him into the office.
We can make him more comfortable in there.

23:13.755 --> 23:15.798
- Would you help me, please?
- Of course.

23:16.475 --> 23:18.591
Thank you for all you're doing, Gordon.

23:18.835 --> 23:20.792
Aye, I only wish I could do more.

23:29.039 --> 23:31.600
The solution is elementary,
my dear Inspector.

23:31.635 --> 23:34.356
Victor Carroon killed the two men,
removed their pressure suits,

23:34.400 --> 23:37.231
pushed their bodies out into space and
then linked the suits together again.

23:37.266 --> 23:38.840
- Now, what do you want?
- Two things.

23:38.842 --> 23:43.056
Number 1, I want to return these files.
Green, Reichenheim, Carroon.

23:43.203 --> 23:45.560
- Very interesting. Carroon ...
- Number 2?

23:45.805 --> 23:47.991
Well, I want you to give
me your solemn word...

23:47.992 --> 23:49.600
Well Inspector, I'm a very busy man.

23:49.627 --> 23:51.516
Now look sir, nobody
ever wins a cold war.

23:51.666 --> 23:53.648
One of us must come
over to the other side.

23:53.649 --> 23:56.584
You don't want to come over to mine.
I'm not proud, I'll come over to yours.

23:56.619 --> 23:57.659
Solemn word about what?

23:57.694 --> 23:59.689
That these were Carroon's fingerprints.

23:59.811 --> 24:02.848
Of course they were.
Everybody in ... gets fingerprinted.

24:03.251 --> 24:04.197
What are you getting at?

24:04.198 --> 24:06.549
Ahh, to be quite honest,
I don't quite know, sir.

24:07.210 --> 24:08.812
Nothing unusual about these.

24:08.953 --> 24:11.972
These are the fingerprints
we took off Carroon last night.

24:12.215 --> 24:13.364
What about them?

24:13.615 --> 24:14.808
Compare them.

24:24.018 --> 24:26.689
- Is this a joke?
- This is no joke, sir.

24:26.741 --> 24:29.056
The man who took those had his
training in the fingerprint section,

24:29.057 --> 24:30.647
second nature to him.

24:32.341 --> 24:33.933
But these prints aren't even ...

24:35.362 --> 24:36.379
human.

24:36.623 --> 24:38.103
Yes. Yeah.

24:38.643 --> 24:39.898
You found what?

24:40.145 --> 24:41.260
I'll be right there.

24:41.485 --> 24:44.402
Well, wherever you're going, I might
as well keep you company, mightn't I?

24:45.866 --> 24:47.863
Thank you.
Very nice of you.

24:49.948 --> 24:52.588
Mr Lionel has checked the
specification of the wiring.

24:53.029 --> 24:54.179
Right there.

25:03.493 --> 25:04.788
Can you get at it?

25:05.234 --> 25:06.462
No.

25:06.714 --> 25:07.889
It's right in a crevice.

25:07.935 --> 25:10.352
Hand me the samples spoon in that box.

25:37.326 --> 25:38.441
Any more of it?

25:38.687 --> 25:39.882
Yes sir, lots.

25:40.406 --> 25:43.126
On the left, by the rivet there.

25:43.787 --> 25:46.078
Mind if we have a
sample for our people?

25:46.450 --> 25:48.122
Sure, we'll give you a sample.

25:52.570 --> 25:55.411
Briscoe, what do you think it is?

25:56.213 --> 25:58.291
I do not know a thing, I'm not sure.

25:59.092 --> 26:00.924
I've been in this thing all night.

26:01.614 --> 26:03.298
I smell there's such thing
around the whole town.

26:03.299 --> 26:04.000
Can I have that lamp?

26:06.656 --> 26:08.753
You got the same bright
thoughts that I have?

26:11.819 --> 26:13.650
Something happened in here.

26:13.899 --> 26:16.474
Something beyond our
understanding at the moment.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.172
If I only knew where to begin.

26:19.307 --> 26:21.582
- Maybe the film will help?
- Film?

26:21.617 --> 26:23.270
Guess the lab should
have developed it by now.

26:23.371 --> 26:25.493
I thought you told me
the camera was smashed.

26:25.528 --> 26:27.761
It was rather damaged but
I managed to get the film out.

26:27.796 --> 26:28.678
Why didn't you tell me?

26:28.702 --> 26:30.461
The lab said they didn't know
if they could develop it or not.

26:30.705 --> 26:31.759
They've got to develop it.

26:32.066 --> 26:33.344
You get right down to that laboratory

26:33.345 --> 26:35.179
and tell them they've
got to develop that film!

26:35.180 --> 26:37.182
- Yes, sir.
- And I'll have no delays or excuses!

26:37.386 --> 26:39.201
Tell them to get the best
process man in the company!

26:39.202 --> 26:41.286
Tell them to get anybody they want,
but I've got to have that film.

26:41.287 --> 26:42.389
Right, sir.

26:43.551 --> 26:45.817
This is one frankly
I don't want to miss.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.635
Well?

27:58.881 --> 28:01.200
It's harmless, it's organic, it's jelly.

28:01.202 --> 28:02.425
End of analysis.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.347
No definite identification?

28:04.385 --> 28:06.996
It might conceivably represent
the dead remnants of cell tissue.

28:07.101 --> 28:10.285
- What sort of cell tissue?
- Could be animal, could be human.

28:11.205 --> 28:13.280
- Human?
- Could have been.

28:16.005 --> 28:19.671
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I know what I'm thinking.

28:20.045 --> 28:23.322
Are you sure it's not
some sort of plant cell?

28:23.527 --> 28:24.766
Positive.

28:25.365 --> 28:28.098
You mean to say that you're
asking me to believe that

28:28.099 --> 28:30.050
that is the remains
of two human beings?

28:30.056 --> 28:31.200
I'm not asking you to believe anything.

28:31.207 --> 28:33.181
You asked a question, I answered it.

28:35.768 --> 28:36.827
Does she know?

28:36.828 --> 28:39.013
No, it's the best sleep
she's had in nights.

28:39.048 --> 28:41.183
What about the police analyst?
What do they say?

28:41.513 --> 28:43.190
No report through yet.

28:43.191 --> 28:45.036
But I don't doubt it will be the same.

28:45.072 --> 28:48.201
It's almost beyond human understanding.

28:48.516 --> 28:51.348
Some fantastic invisible force ...

28:51.695 --> 28:54.166
converted two men into ...

28:54.316 --> 28:55.719
jelly.

28:55.798 --> 28:58.237
- Is that the slide?
- That's the slide.

28:59.198 --> 29:01.371
I'm about to call it a day, Quatermass.

29:01.439 --> 29:03.785
- Beyond this I'm a ...
- Gordon!

29:07.962 --> 29:09.725
Alright, get him up.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.085
No, wait a minute.

29:11.824 --> 29:13.151
His hand,

29:13.603 --> 29:15.178
another change.

29:15.446 --> 29:17.081
Get him back to bed.

29:25.912 --> 29:29.023
Look what's happening to his skin
in just the last few moments.

29:29.058 --> 29:30.567
I'll go and get him a sedative.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.607
You've done it to him.

29:35.642 --> 29:37.791
He'd been better off if he'd been
killed and stayed out there.

29:37.792 --> 29:38.449
Judith!

29:38.450 --> 29:40.668
You've destroyed him like you
destroyed everything else you've touched.

29:40.729 --> 29:42.700
Destroyed him?
I've brought him back, I've saved him!

29:42.701 --> 29:44.817
Saved him for what?
For further experiments?

29:44.852 --> 29:47.052
I can help him more than
you or anyone else can.

29:47.087 --> 29:49.905
There's no room for personal
feelings in science, Judith.

29:49.940 --> 29:51.068
Some of us have a mission.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.861
You should be very
proud to have a husband

29:52.862 --> 29:55.639
who's willing to risk his life for the
betterment of the whole world.

29:55.674 --> 29:58.747
What world?  Your world?
The world of Quatermass!

29:59.522 --> 30:01.138
I have sent for an ambulance.

30:01.565 --> 30:03.675
He's going to the Central Clinic.

30:05.427 --> 30:06.694
Alright Briscoe.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.378
Send them to the clinic.

30:09.268 --> 30:11.680
But I want them to have
complete isolation, you understand.

30:11.681 --> 30:15.335
Complete isolation.
No one is to see them.

30:16.351 --> 30:17.400
No one,

30:17.651 --> 30:19.131
until I say so.

30:30.157 --> 30:32.063
We've tried three
different grade of stock,

30:32.064 --> 30:34.278
developed each one to its
higher gamma as possible

30:34.313 --> 30:36.063
and still it's made no difference.

30:36.498 --> 30:39.307
- Look at this.  It's grainy and dark.
- All I want is a print!

30:39.342 --> 30:41.087
Well, we don't like any print
that isn't up to standard.

30:41.088 --> 30:42.157
Is there a picture of it?

30:42.319 --> 30:44.610
Oh, there's a picture alright.
But you can see how dull and grainy ...

30:44.614 --> 30:46.990
I don't care how dull and grainy
it is.   I must have this now.

30:46.998 --> 30:49.542
It could be altitude, or an
extreme change of temperature,

30:49.543 --> 30:50.969
or penetration of cosmic rays.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.054
Fine, fine.
I'll tell him that.

30:52.055 --> 30:53.570
Well, I don't know what
the old man will say.

30:53.572 --> 30:55.634
Listen, you tell your old
man that our old man says

30:55.635 --> 30:58.105
if he didn't get this print
he'd dynamite the building.

31:00.228 --> 31:03.030
I can't tell the Ministry this.
They'll think I lost my senses.

31:03.032 --> 31:04.924
That's exactly why you
must tell them nothing.

31:04.991 --> 31:08.219
Now you see why I must have
absolute authority to isolate Carroon.

31:08.220 --> 31:11.245
But every newspaper in town has got a
story on him being admitted into the clinic.

31:11.247 --> 31:12.777
They'll want to know why
and what's happened to him

31:12.778 --> 31:13.640
on what's happened to the others.

31:13.645 --> 31:16.080
- Alright, do you want to tell him?
- But not telling them won't stop the panic.

31:16.086 --> 31:18.028
What they don't know
won't start a panic.

31:18.063 --> 31:20.948
- Inspector, what about the police analysis?
- The same, Mr Blake.

31:21.498 --> 31:22.912
Well, what's the next move?

31:22.913 --> 31:25.968
Oh, we've agreed to isolation.  There isn't
anything we can do until we know more.

31:29.600 --> 31:30.717
Yeah?

31:35.443 --> 31:36.716
The film is ready.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.526
- See that Marsh, it works!
- Yes, sir.

32:20.561 --> 32:22.136
- What works?
- Automatic prism.

32:22.183 --> 32:23.605
It touch on the panel reading.

33:22.447 --> 33:23.625
What?  Is that all?

33:23.627 --> 33:26.740
Once in the observation zone, the camera's
geared to cut out at regular intervals.

33:26.775 --> 33:28.588
This will be at 0.160.

33:33.411 --> 33:35.324
That must be where we lost them.

33:48.298 --> 33:50.152
What the hell could have happened?

33:50.300 --> 33:52.938
Look at that fantastic
temperature drop.

35:29.701 --> 35:31.137
Run it again.

35:37.484 --> 35:39.018
He's in surgery.

35:39.164 --> 35:41.059
But I'll get word to
him as soon as possible.

35:41.544 --> 35:43.916
Yes, what's the name, please?

35:45.767 --> 35:47.185
That's two T's?

35:52.309 --> 35:54.223
Yes, I'll see that he gets it.

35:54.351 --> 35:55.580
Yes.

35:57.432 --> 35:59.926
Sorry, miss, the
visiting hours are over.

35:59.961 --> 36:02.137
I just wanted to know
how my husband is.

36:02.554 --> 36:04.455
I'll try and find out for you, miss.

36:04.474 --> 36:07.275
- What would the name be?
- Carroon, Victor Carroon.

36:07.296 --> 36:09.802
- Oh.
- He's alright, isn't he?

36:09.837 --> 36:13.580
Mrs Carroon, I wish I could let
you go up, but we have strict

36:13.581 --> 36:15.025
- orders about your husband.
- All I want to know is how is he?

36:15.060 --> 36:16.600
Is there any change?

36:17.641 --> 36:18.869
Just a minute.

36:21.642 --> 36:22.758
Hello Mabel?

36:23.544 --> 36:26.236
Listen, how is 4B?

36:26.964 --> 36:30.292
I know about the orders, but
I only want you to think out loud.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.735
Thank you, Mabel.
Thank you.

36:34.346 --> 36:36.397
Still about the same, Mrs Carroon,

36:36.432 --> 36:38.046
no change but no worse.

36:38.081 --> 36:40.489
If I could see him,
just for a few minutes.

36:40.631 --> 36:42.210
I should be shot at dawn.

36:42.212 --> 36:46.263
- But don't you worry. He's in good hands.
- They don't leave him alone, do they?

36:46.313 --> 36:47.479
Ooh, not for a moment.

36:47.651 --> 36:49.341
Tucker, his night
nurse is with him now

36:49.353 --> 36:51.893
and Perkins comes on
in about half an hour.

36:51.894 --> 36:53.893
- The fella is good as any doctor.
- Could I wait for the night nurse

36:53.894 --> 36:55.235
when he comes off duty.

36:55.237 --> 36:58.899
If only to talk to someone who
has been with him.   Please.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.204
Tucker comes off in about half an hour.

37:01.239 --> 37:03.281
He usually dips out
through the staff entrance.

37:03.319 --> 37:05.491
Turn left through the doors
and it's on the right.

37:05.492 --> 37:07.206
- Thank you.
- Wait for him outside.

37:07.441 --> 37:09.808
And if the ask me,
I never told you nothing.

37:33.109 --> 37:35.106
There's only the nurse with
him.  His name's Tucker.

37:35.107 --> 37:37.265
His name?  You mean
I got to plan for the "he"?

37:37.334 --> 37:40.350
Please hurry.  You've only got half and
hour before the relief nurse comes on duty.

37:40.352 --> 37:42.495
- Another one in pants?
- His name's Perkins.

37:42.496 --> 37:43.870
Have you got any money?

37:44.017 --> 37:46.335
Cash before delivery, it always
gives me more confidence.

37:46.336 --> 37:48.525
Especially when I'm
investigating is this type ...

37:48.618 --> 37:50.491
- Room 4B.
- 4B.

37:56.199 --> 37:57.600
Give me 15 minutes.

37:57.841 --> 38:00.500
I'll put him in the lift and
standing by.  Then he's all yours.

38:00.501 --> 38:03.237
- I never saw you in my ...
- Please hurry.  He's very sick.

38:03.284 --> 38:05.347
Don't worry I'll
murder him like a baby.

38:25.572 --> 38:27.293
You've got to get it.

38:27.413 --> 38:30.176
Relax lady, you're
shaking the building.

38:53.784 --> 38:55.578
- Good evening.
- Yes.

39:00.787 --> 39:03.509
Evening.  I'm from casualty.
Perkins is sick.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.125
They sent me to take
over his night shift.

39:05.126 --> 39:08.193
Fine, I don't know in two hours, but
you're not until for another half hour!

39:08.200 --> 39:11.121
Who cares?  Night shift is night shift.
What's a half an hour you got there.

39:11.122 --> 39:12.170
You know you go to heaven for this.

39:12.312 --> 39:14.510
With our rate of pay, we
should get some fun out of life.

39:14.513 --> 39:16.712
- What's his trouble?
- Doesn't seem to know.

39:16.747 --> 39:19.354
He's the star patient.
He just lies and stares.

39:19.576 --> 39:23.274
Never opens his mouth.  But if
he does, press that bell and quick.

39:23.417 --> 39:24.835
Well, happy nightmare.

39:24.839 --> 39:26.901
- Any special instructions?
- It's all on the chart.

39:26.902 --> 39:28.232
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

39:32.521 --> 39:33.715
News my friend.

39:33.961 --> 39:35.918
Your wife is waiting
for you downstairs.

39:36.162 --> 39:37.800
I'm the man who's
gonna get you out of here.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.762
Does that make you happy?

39:39.804 --> 39:41.178
It does.
Good!

39:41.200 --> 39:43.936
Now we don't have too
much time, so up we get.

39:55.089 --> 39:56.564
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:56.599 --> 39:59.330
- What time are you off?
- Ask him whether he's going to live or not.

39:59.372 --> 40:01.830
- Operating?
- About three and a half hours at least.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.327
- You too?
- Me too.

40:03.473 --> 40:05.132
Chinese restaurants
open until midnight.

40:05.133 --> 40:06.390
Take your vote.

40:06.395 --> 40:07.809
Beautiful sweet and sour pork,

40:07.854 --> 40:11.313
- roast duck, fried shrimps.
- You talked us into it.

40:11.518 --> 40:14.028
Here we are, now the jacket.

40:21.260 --> 40:22.475
That's a good boy.

40:22.901 --> 40:25.054
Can't meet the lady looking sloppy.

40:25.322 --> 40:29.816
You know it's funny, wives usually employ
me to get them away from their husbands.

40:30.144 --> 40:31.858
Oh, you're a sad one!

40:32.265 --> 40:34.063
Well, to each his own.

40:34.346 --> 40:36.158
Hey, steady, steady.

40:36.568 --> 40:40.139
Now you stay here while Christie goes
and get the lift.  Won't be a minute.

41:07.439 --> 41:08.493
All clear.

41:08.499 --> 41:09.943
Hey, come on, hurry.

41:10.461 --> 41:13.429
That's the boy.  Christie's got you.

41:37.611 --> 41:38.892
What have you got there?

41:41.075 --> 41:42.391
What are you hiding?

41:44.954 --> 41:46.170
What is it?

42:02.623 --> 42:03.839
Victor.

42:04.163 --> 42:05.714
Oh Victor, darling.

42:05.925 --> 42:07.558
I've got the car outside.

42:07.705 --> 42:09.218
Please try and be quick.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.984
You can make it dear.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.198
Everything's going
to be alright, Victor.

42:26.373 --> 42:29.513
I'll get you the best treatment,
the finest doctors.

42:31.014 --> 42:32.788
I'll get you well and strong.

42:33.015 --> 42:35.228
We'll make a new life for ourselves.

42:35.277 --> 42:37.050
Away from all this.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.994
Away from him.

42:39.499 --> 42:41.750
Our life will be our own.

42:48.743 --> 42:50.271
Would you like one?

42:55.746 --> 42:56.961
Victor, I ...

43:04.408 --> 43:05.623
Victor.

43:13.532 --> 43:14.847
Your hand.

43:15.474 --> 43:16.890
Are you in pain?

43:34.701 --> 43:38.163
Well, this is one case I don't think
we'll find listed in forensic medicine.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.533
It looks as though the life
was drawn right out of him.

43:40.585 --> 43:42.625
Have the body examined
by a head pathologist.

43:42.626 --> 43:44.338
I'd like a report as soon as possible.

43:44.340 --> 43:46.827
The headlines ... pathologist
also took a little beep.

43:46.828 --> 43:48.358
I don't care if he dumps
his head into a ring.

43:48.359 --> 43:50.920
They picked up Mrs Carroon the
other side of town. Car full of luggage.

43:50.921 --> 43:52.534
- And Carroon?
- No sign of him.

43:52.628 --> 43:54.889
Stupid idiot.  Trying to take the
whole thing in her own hands.

43:54.890 --> 43:56.830
- What did he go?  What did she say?
- She didn't say anything.

43:56.832 --> 43:59.125
Anything about him.  She's in
a pretty bad state of shock.

43:59.126 --> 44:00.174
If not about him, then about what?

44:00.180 --> 44:01.707
The doctor said she may
even go out of her mind.

44:01.793 --> 44:04.286
Out of her mind about what?  What
did she say?  Come on, talk man.

44:04.715 --> 44:08.889
Well, when they found her, she was
just sitting at the wheel of a car.

44:09.055 --> 44:13.737
And moaning, something
about a hand being all grey

44:14.017 --> 44:15.510
with thorns like a ...

44:15.757 --> 44:17.691
like a cactus.

44:31.084 --> 44:33.100
I remember there was a
cactus in this room, in this pot.

44:33.105 --> 44:35.556
- Can I get a line to this?
- Yes

44:37.146 --> 44:40.383
Hello?
Hello.

44:41.150 --> 44:42.722
Henry's coming down.

44:44.570 --> 44:47.263
<i> Car-three-nine</i>

44:47.298 --> 44:50.930
<i>Proceed immediately
to 34 Main Elm Street ...</i>

44:50.933 --> 44:53.489
<i> and investigate a
complaint by resident</i>

44:53.912 --> 44:55.367
<i>maybe Carroon.</i>

44:55.414 --> 44:57.492
<i>Proceed with caution car-three-nine.</i>

44:57.855 --> 44:59.766
<i>Cars ....</i>

45:00.215 --> 45:02.775
<i>join river police at Hayes Wharf</i>

45:02.810 --> 45:05.729
<i>to search area bounded
by .... and Tilly street.</i>

45:10.501 --> 45:13.751
<i>River Patrol 4.</i>

45:13.786 --> 45:15.812
<i>join mobile police...</i>

45:16.063 --> 45:20.729
<i>to search area boarded by Toddy
Street, Hayes Lane and Strat Temps</i>

45:20.765 --> 45:23.459
<i> River Patrol 4.
Roger.  Out.</i>

45:54.426 --> 45:56.440
This growth on the face.

45:56.444 --> 45:58.460
Half plant, half ...

45:58.927 --> 45:59.829
Look at this.

46:00.486 --> 46:04.330
Look what it's done.  The whole
tissue structure's eaten away.

46:04.331 --> 46:05.871
The bones, powder.

46:06.710 --> 46:08.555
Well, that takes care
of my supper tonight.

46:10.073 --> 46:13.939
Briscoe, what if there is
a form of life in space?

46:13.974 --> 46:16.754
Not on some planet, but just drifting.

46:17.095 --> 46:18.211
I don't know.

46:21.920 --> 46:23.841
Not life, as we know it.

46:23.876 --> 46:27.756
With intelligence, yes, but pure
energy, with no organic structure.

46:27.791 --> 46:28.944
- Invisible.
- Invisible?

46:28.979 --> 46:30.932
Now the rocket past through its path.

46:30.982 --> 46:34.376
It entered the rocket.  It found
living specimens of our form of life.

46:34.520 --> 46:38.037
- Cell organisms.  Human.
- Green and Reichenheim.

46:38.928 --> 46:40.425
And Carroon.
Exactly.

46:40.426 --> 46:44.263
Now, if even by accident it could
enter one of those structures.

46:44.851 --> 46:47.087
What a way to invade the Earth.

46:47.472 --> 46:49.170
Now look sir, I'm not over
intelligent, but when you ...

46:49.173 --> 46:51.134
You saw the film, you
know what happened.

46:51.775 --> 46:54.690
Only God knows where and
how far that rocket traveled.

46:54.738 --> 46:58.026
- But only two of them died.
- Something got into that rocket!

46:58.458 --> 47:01.693
Took the blood out of the other
two and now it's using Carroon.

47:01.781 --> 47:05.163
And it's found other
forms of life, the cactus.

47:05.522 --> 47:08.743
- Good grief.  You mean Carroon's ...
- a carrier.

47:08.986 --> 47:12.092
He is now another shell
of a man being transformed.

47:12.265 --> 47:14.925
If all these cactus plants were
subject to the same mutation

47:14.928 --> 47:17.749
there could be an affinity, a
union between plant and animal

47:17.790 --> 47:19.780
with the ability to destroy,

47:20.509 --> 47:21.628
and possess

47:21.874 --> 47:23.624
and multiply...

47:25.353 --> 47:26.469
at will.

47:27.555 --> 47:28.953
Multiply?

47:29.194 --> 47:31.875
Yes, but to multiply,
first it has to live.

47:32.158 --> 47:33.749
And like any living thing,

47:33.798 --> 47:38.659
to live, it must have food.

48:05.637 --> 48:07.310
I'm sorry, we're closed.

48:08.719 --> 48:10.311
Alright, just a minute.

48:12.857 --> 48:14.438
We only open until ...

48:14.658 --> 48:16.233
Hey, wait a minute!

48:16.420 --> 48:18.680
You can't come into a place like this!

48:18.780 --> 48:20.192
Leave those things alone!

48:24.257 --> 48:25.878
What do you think you're doing?

48:28.717 --> 48:30.346
Are you in pain?

48:34.100 --> 48:36.672
Is it something to do with your arm?

48:37.438 --> 48:40.269
Look, I'll just take a look.
I won't hurt it, I promise.

48:54.516 --> 48:55.635
No!

48:59.557 --> 49:01.431
Alright love, I'll get it.

49:04.598 --> 49:05.813
Hello?

49:05.957 --> 49:07.172
Yes, Best.

49:07.856 --> 49:08.974
What?

49:09.219 --> 49:10.493
When?

49:10.538 --> 49:12.516
Right.  Cordon off the whole area.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.689
Tell Quatermass and
Briscoe to meet us there.

49:15.338 --> 49:16.457
Love!

49:17.899 --> 49:19.852
- Now what?
- I've got to go back.

49:19.900 --> 49:22.215
- But you just come in.
- They just can't do without me, love.

49:23.100 --> 49:25.012
I don't know why you
don't move into the office.

49:25.062 --> 49:26.899
You'd never believe I was there.

49:26.940 --> 49:28.938
What makes you think I do now?

49:29.059 --> 49:31.490
- Have your tea at least.
- Haven't got time, love.

49:32.161 --> 49:35.139
The thing that you do to
that poor stomach of yours.

49:35.281 --> 49:36.919
I ought to get you a picnic basket.

49:36.961 --> 49:39.359
What I'm going on is no picnic.

49:39.522 --> 49:42.640
- What about dinner?
- Cook and keep your fingers crossed.

49:42.644 --> 49:44.058
Bye love.

49:50.067 --> 49:53.160
- What do you think he was trying to do?
- I'd like to think, kill himself.

49:53.166 --> 49:55.800
You see if mix the normal of that,
it will be death in 5 minutes.

49:55.801 --> 49:57.663
What?  What is it?

49:57.664 --> 49:59.108
I have a bit of sick
feeling it was something

49:59.109 --> 50:01.324
to speed up the change
going on inside him.

50:01.406 --> 50:04.220
But Carroon was an engineer, he
doesn't know anything about chemistry.

50:04.223 --> 50:06.121
Carroon didn't know.

50:06.124 --> 50:08.552
There is a kettle still on and there's
no sign of the chemist anywhere.

50:08.804 --> 50:10.004
What do you think he was doing here?

50:10.005 --> 50:12.195
- Well, one thing he was doing ...
- We're not certain.

50:12.324 --> 50:14.536
Not certain about
anything with this customer.

50:14.683 --> 50:15.442
Well?

50:15.443 --> 50:18.089
Nobody in the street heard anything.
They're all in church or in the local.

50:18.090 --> 50:19.560
He must have ...

50:29.220 --> 50:30.651
Evans, come in quick,

50:30.898 --> 50:32.176
and quiet.

52:24.949 --> 52:26.145
Here we are.

52:30.515 --> 52:32.153
And it's just the two of us today.

52:32.396 --> 52:34.114
We'll have our own tea-party.

52:34.476 --> 52:36.799
I don't like those other girls anyway.

52:36.900 --> 52:39.724
All they do is talk about
their new clothes and dolls.

52:39.900 --> 52:42.159
You don't care about
those things, do you?

52:42.194 --> 52:44.169
You don't care about
new clothes or anything.

52:44.205 --> 52:45.803
We're friends.

52:48.668 --> 52:52.143
Now you sit down and be a
good girl while I make the tea.

52:54.611 --> 52:56.092
There's a teapot,

52:56.574 --> 52:58.408
there's a cup.

53:03.859 --> 53:06.903
And I brought the most
delicious cakes and biscuits.

53:07.121 --> 53:10.461
The others never serve
anything, but we do.

53:11.147 --> 53:13.026
Look, I'm pretty yummy.

53:14.386 --> 53:15.615
Don't be frightened,

53:15.668 --> 53:18.865
that's only the old rats
living in this old boat.

53:19.352 --> 53:21.748
Now, tea is ready.

53:23.274 --> 53:24.790
Sugar?  One?

53:25.198 --> 53:26.551
Two, alright.

53:27.197 --> 53:28.930
Now you may have a cake.

53:28.939 --> 53:31.113
This one is filled with cherries.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.576
But anyway, I like that one
cause it's full of chocolate.

53:35.845 --> 53:38.384
Ooh, we thought you were a rat.

53:40.408 --> 53:42.397
Won't you stay and
have tea with us?

53:44.151 --> 53:48.130
We'd very much like you to stay.
You look so tired.

53:48.653 --> 53:51.086
There's plenty, if that's
what you're worried about.

53:51.397 --> 53:53.250
And cakes too.

53:54.279 --> 53:56.372
Go on dolly, you ask him.

53:56.701 --> 53:59.661
Please, won't you have
tea and cakes with us?

53:59.903 --> 54:01.383
Don't be frightened,

54:01.624 --> 54:03.937
we would like you to stay very much.

54:04.088 --> 54:07.298
And you may have the cake
that has all the chocolate inside.

54:07.333 --> 54:08.341
Tell him, dolly.

54:33.410 --> 54:34.527
Yes.

54:35.090 --> 54:36.684
What time was this?

54:36.932 --> 54:38.490
Was it an eye-witness?

54:38.973 --> 54:40.124
I see.

54:40.275 --> 54:41.530
Well, he's been doing fine.

54:41.531 --> 54:44.872
He's been positively seen in Liverpool,
Margate, Ostend and the Orkneys.

54:44.907 --> 54:46.046
Yes.

54:46.198 --> 54:48.292
- Yes.  Deptford area.
- What?

54:48.641 --> 54:51.181
A kid told her mother ...
Yes?

54:51.424 --> 54:52.744
About two hours ago?

54:52.986 --> 54:54.258
Hold it please.

54:54.305 --> 54:57.720
The kid got a doll broken by a man down
by some derelict boat near Deptford.

54:57.768 --> 54:59.125
Oh, so it had to be Carroon?

54:59.171 --> 55:01.008
No, the mother's complaining
about molesting kids.

55:01.009 --> 55:03.467
Deptford said the
description could fit Carroon.

55:03.502 --> 55:05.995
All right.  Well, that's why
there's a police station at Deptford.

55:06.436 --> 55:08.850
Thank you Deptford.
Keep us informed.

55:08.856 --> 55:11.880
Bye bye.
A Deptford alert on Carroon.

55:11.883 --> 55:15.134
Yes, I know it is, so your boys
can have another little drive.

55:15.841 --> 55:18.888
Cover derelict boats,
warehouses and bomb shelters.

55:19.286 --> 55:21.443
Alright, so do it again.

55:22.185 --> 55:24.872
Where is he getting food,
that's what I'd like to know?

55:25.911 --> 55:27.207
Now, now shut up, Simba!

55:27.853 --> 55:29.173
Time to go to bed.

55:29.174 --> 55:32.148
Go on.  Off you go. Go on.
Don't stand there gaping at me.

55:32.149 --> 55:33.505
Off you go to bed!

55:44.745 --> 55:45.861
Goodnight fellas.

55:46.047 --> 55:47.377
Sleep well.

55:47.428 --> 55:49.585
Hello, Joey.
You know something?

55:49.729 --> 55:52.551
Could have sworn I saw you having
tea in a cafe this afternoon.

55:52.792 --> 55:54.626
Turns out to be a customer though.

58:44.125 --> 58:46.325
TO LION HOUSE

59:29.139 --> 59:32.040
This is exactly as the keeper
found him when he came on duty.

59:32.044 --> 59:34.524
- Are the others the same?
- Yes, over here.

59:46.496 --> 59:49.058
They found three more still
outside the antelope house,

59:49.098 --> 59:50.084
or what was left of them.

59:50.418 --> 59:51.506
Look.

59:56.482 --> 59:57.677
Look at that.

59:57.923 --> 01:00:00.380
- Complete absorption this time.
- That's what I've been afraid of.

01:00:00.387 --> 01:00:02.875
Inspector, get this place closed,
get everybody out of here.

01:00:02.876 --> 01:00:04.140
- Right.
- Quickly and quietly as possible.

01:00:04.175 --> 01:00:05.200
No panic, no charging.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.370
Close the whole place up?
As we already ...

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:09.430
Listen, sir, you've got to take it
from us.  We know what we are doing.

01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:10.950
Just tell your men
to cooperate, please.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.667
Well, I don't understand
what's happening, anyway.

01:00:12.915 --> 01:00:13.994
What killed these animals?

01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:16.913
- You better say natural causes for now.
- What?

01:00:19.881 --> 01:00:21.793
Sorry, ma'am we're
closed this morning.

01:00:21.842 --> 01:00:23.882
Closed, but we've come
all the way from Epping.

01:00:23.883 --> 01:00:26.164
Sorry ma'am.  We're not to
open to the public this morning.

01:00:26.308 --> 01:00:29.286
- Will it be opened this afternoon?
- Oh, I wish I could tell you, sir.

01:00:29.527 --> 01:00:30.884
Sorry folks, still closed.

01:00:30.912 --> 01:00:32.971
I'm very sorry now, but
we're closed this morning.

01:00:33.114 --> 01:00:34.829
I'm very sorry, sir.

01:01:09.338 --> 01:01:10.456
Quatermass!

01:01:10.781 --> 01:01:11.898
Inspector!

01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:20.587
What is it?

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:21.980
He was here .

01:01:24.234 --> 01:01:25.350
Look at this.

01:01:27.359 --> 01:01:28.508
It's alive.

01:01:28.758 --> 01:01:31.483
- Looks pretty horrible doesn't it?
- Quick, the sample box!

01:01:35.645 --> 01:01:39.946
Well, what manner or a shape
of thing do we look for now?

01:01:39.981 --> 01:01:41.510
You'll know it when you see it.

01:01:41.512 --> 01:01:44.761
Just send your men out with
a prayer that we find it in time.

01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:51.119
It's almost too
terrifying to think about it.

01:01:51.154 --> 01:01:54.140
In less than 12 minutes every
animal completely absorbed

01:01:54.147 --> 01:01:55.345
pray except one.

01:01:55.692 --> 01:01:57.670
Gone like quicksand.

01:01:58.135 --> 01:02:00.629
But this quicksand
knows what it's doing.

01:02:00.664 --> 01:02:02.327
It's trebled it's size in an hour.

01:02:02.461 --> 01:02:03.622
Do you know what this means?

01:02:04.142 --> 01:02:06.276
This is only a fragment
of the main organism.

01:02:06.706 --> 01:02:09.202
If the same thing is happening to
him at the same rate or speed,

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:11.290
if absorbing those
mice could do this ...

01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:11.950
I know.

01:02:11.951 --> 01:02:14.346
There is no living thing on earth
that stands a chance against it.

01:02:14.596 --> 01:02:16.413
How do we fight it, how do we stop it?

01:02:17.261 --> 01:02:19.282
Hands off, you young man!

01:02:19.317 --> 01:02:22.008
Fix him and then I come
here on my own accord.

01:02:22.009 --> 01:02:22.737
Yes, yes.

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:25.335
I come here to complain
about something which I saw.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:26.687
Okay Rosie, you keep saying now ...

01:02:26.817 --> 01:02:29.499
I refuse to talk about it
to any common constable ...

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.339
who has nothing comes to do all
day but show me big flat fleet.

01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:35.344
Only big fat fleet.

01:02:36.588 --> 01:02:38.540
Now, come on, Rosie old girl.

01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:39.755
Don't you ... call me!

01:02:39.935 --> 01:02:41.635
I mean I'm enough to be your mother.

01:02:42.078 --> 01:02:44.681
What respectable woman in
London would be ... now?

01:02:46.824 --> 01:02:49.157
I come in here of my own free will.

01:02:49.407 --> 01:02:52.319
I come come here on
my own volich ... volition.

01:02:52.354 --> 01:02:53.631
Very glad we all to see you, Rosie.

01:02:53.655 --> 01:02:56.451
- What can we do for you this time?
- I wish to make a report.

01:02:56.618 --> 01:02:57.839
Miss Rosemary...

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.927
Elizabeth Wrigley.

01:02:59.962 --> 01:03:02.963
- What address this week?
- I'm temporarily visiting.

01:03:02.998 --> 01:03:04.681
- Bow Street?
- With friends.

01:03:04.716 --> 01:03:07.208
Salvation Army.
The embankment.

01:03:07.243 --> 01:03:08.601
What did you see this time, Rosie?

01:03:08.799 --> 01:03:11.060
Oh, it was terrible.
Shocking.

01:03:11.066 --> 01:03:13.341
It always is, Rosie.
Just tell me what you saw?

01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:16.459
Of course it's been of a thing of a young
woman can't walk the streets in London

01:03:16.494 --> 01:03:19.368
with that creepy crawly
thing up in around that place.

01:03:19.892 --> 01:03:23.352
What is the police for, if not for
protect us from the likes of that?

01:03:23.519 --> 01:03:26.189
Go on.  Tell me.  Tell me
what's the police force for?

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:27.432
- Rosie!
- Yes?

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:30.035
Rosie, just tell me what you saw,

01:03:30.070 --> 01:03:33.339
and we at the London Metropolitan
Police will do all in our power

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.848
to see that it doesn't occur again.

01:03:34.883 --> 01:03:37.118
You were with voice wreck so drunk,

01:03:37.153 --> 01:03:39.105
that I couldn't
even yell for a copper.

01:03:39.365 --> 01:03:41.596
I still got this sore of this.

01:03:41.745 --> 01:03:43.198
Why is it aren't to remember.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.643
And water makes me as sick as a baby.

01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:47.522
It better be worthwhile, Rosie.

01:03:48.114 --> 01:03:49.718
After you tell me.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:53.661
I was sitting in a door right here.

01:03:53.743 --> 01:03:55.783
I wasn't feeling too well.

01:03:56.026 --> 01:03:58.805
And the doctor says that too
much walking is bad for my legs.

01:03:59.051 --> 01:04:01.050
- It's my legs you see.
- You were sitting in the door way.

01:04:01.052 --> 01:04:02.540
Yeah, just for a minute or two.

01:04:02.656 --> 01:04:06.704
When suddenly I heard a ...
kind of rustling it was.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.979
Rustling?

01:04:08.024 --> 01:04:09.223
So I looked.

01:04:09.325 --> 01:04:13.009
And there, at the end of the
street, I saw something moved.

01:04:13.253 --> 01:04:14.947
Something enormous!

01:04:15.095 --> 01:04:16.409
What moved Rosie?

01:04:16.474 --> 01:04:18.972
Well, I couldn't make
out the shape properly.

01:04:19.243 --> 01:04:21.798
I usually might get the
shapes of these things.

01:04:22.263 --> 01:04:23.621
Think carefully, Rosie.

01:04:23.868 --> 01:04:25.188
Was it ...?

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:28.824
This something, was it
walking quickly or slowly?

01:04:29.514 --> 01:04:30.870
Walking?

01:04:31.156 --> 01:04:34.306
It was kind of
crawling, up on the wall.

01:04:34.462 --> 01:04:37.843
Not like any of the things that
I'll see on a Saturday nights.

01:04:38.088 --> 01:04:39.924
No Rosie, I think this
time you really saw it.

01:04:40.171 --> 01:04:42.563
Get me the Yard.
Well cancel it.  This is priority.

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:46.177
Really saw it?  You mean
this time it's not hallu... ?

01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:49.537
- It's not a gin goblin?
- No, Rosie.  This time it was real.

01:04:49.786 --> 01:04:50.903
Real?

01:04:51.548 --> 01:04:52.666
It's my legs!

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:54.646
Hello, Scotland Yard.

01:04:54.792 --> 01:04:57.090
Yes. Inspector Lomax, please.

01:04:59.161 --> 01:05:00.390
Lomax here.

01:05:00.762 --> 01:05:01.991
Yes.

01:05:02.805 --> 01:05:04.032
Say that again.

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:06.684
Contact the Commissioner right away.

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:12.535
Hello?

01:05:12.581 --> 01:05:13.598
Yes.

01:05:14.142 --> 01:05:15.291
Yes.

01:05:15.702 --> 01:05:17.184
We'll be right there.

01:05:18.346 --> 01:05:19.499
Lomax.

01:05:21.693 --> 01:05:25.188
Said it climbed a
brick wall 30 feet high.

01:06:03.035 --> 01:06:06.073
Yes, no doubt at all he was here.
Quite recently too.

01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:08.308
The trail ends on the wall.

01:06:08.558 --> 01:06:09.991
Let me have that case up here!

01:06:10.137 --> 01:06:12.071
Get him his case, Sergeant.
Send the car in please.

01:06:12.562 --> 01:06:14.071
Use the car radio.

01:06:14.619 --> 01:06:17.517
I want to cordon off the entire
area and evacuate all public.

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:19.145
Tell Evan and Mason to
check on every movement

01:06:19.146 --> 01:06:21.300
that is likely to take place
inside this radius tonight.

01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:22.320
Yes sir.

01:06:23.086 --> 01:06:25.067
Warn everyone not to
touch anything unusual

01:06:25.068 --> 01:06:27.261
they may find in the
streets or their gardens.

01:06:27.296 --> 01:06:29.005
Warn the children, especially.

01:07:21.355 --> 01:07:22.469
It got out?

01:07:24.577 --> 01:07:26.376
Look at the size of it now!

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:28.410
Without food except mice.

01:07:29.858 --> 01:07:30.811
Is it dead?

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.421
Yes, but don't touch it.

01:07:35.456 --> 01:07:37.571
Look at these phalanges,
spore producing patches.

01:07:37.641 --> 01:07:39.702
If the limbs complete
this reproductive cycle,

01:07:39.703 --> 01:07:41.682
this would have been
a jungle of living tendrils.

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:44.296
How many more of these things
are there around London?

01:07:44.348 --> 01:07:45.431
I think you better call Lomax.

01:07:45.505 --> 01:07:47.569
It's not a question of how
many but where are they?

01:07:48.048 --> 01:07:49.540
If they can reproduce at this rate,

01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:52.778
another 24 hours, a few days...

01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:54.406
Get me Scotland Yard quickly.

01:07:54.652 --> 01:07:56.535
What's project ...
Project had reached the mice.

01:07:57.733 --> 01:07:58.849
Yes

01:07:59.213 --> 01:08:00.326
Yes, of course.

01:08:01.133 --> 01:08:02.248
The Commissioner.

01:08:02.296 --> 01:08:03.736
- They're getting him, sir.
- Right.

01:08:04.574 --> 01:08:05.691
Get hold of Evans.

01:08:05.936 --> 01:08:07.415
I want him to get out
an anti-panic statement.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:09.984
I want it broadcast, televised
and fill in all the nationals.

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:10.764
Yes, sir.

01:08:10.899 --> 01:08:13.826
I want every available man
on search of the area.

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:17.212
Immediate search of parks,
fields, undergrounds and subways.

01:08:17.903 --> 01:08:19.558
Yes sir, it's the
Quatermass Experiment.

01:08:19.602 --> 01:08:21.511
I am please enough to
take advance top level sir.

01:08:21.513 --> 01:08:23.381
I need troops and the civil defense.

01:08:23.504 --> 01:08:24.953
Yes sir, I'll be right out.

01:09:11.368 --> 01:09:14.028
Now this is all we need to start
the program with a swing.

01:09:14.063 --> 01:09:15.122
What's he talking about?

01:09:15.191 --> 01:09:17.652
Oh, no one must touch anything
unusual we find on the streets.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:20.399
Don't panic.  Just inform
the nearest police station.

01:09:20.419 --> 01:09:21.923
They've been putting that
out all day on the radio.

01:09:22.777 --> 01:09:24.252
Westminster Abbey.

01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:26.005
Yes

01:09:26.258 --> 01:09:27.484
Standing by.

01:09:27.837 --> 01:09:29.170
Opening announcement coming up.

01:09:29.419 --> 01:09:31.055
Okay, standby cameras.

01:09:37.904 --> 01:09:39.816
Alright Camera 1, titles are in.

01:09:40.064 --> 01:09:42.209
We will be on you in five seconds.

01:09:42.946 --> 01:09:44.741
four, three,

01:09:44.988 --> 01:09:46.863
two, one.

01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:53.959
Oh, you Camera 1, where are you?

01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.277
Alright quick, take over Camera 2.
On you instead.

01:10:01.154 --> 01:10:02.269
What is that?

01:10:02.715 --> 01:10:04.544
- What's happened?
- Looks like a body.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.378
Kill transmission.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:10.010
Landrow, fill in will you?
I'll get back as soon as possible.

01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:11.268
Tell presentations.

01:10:11.519 --> 01:10:12.634
Hello?

01:10:31.329 --> 01:10:32.524
What's going on here?

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.510
- He fell from the scaffold.
- Slipped?

01:10:34.511 --> 01:10:37.402
- Dead before he fell.
- Dead before he fell?

01:10:37.655 --> 01:10:40.161
Sir, I should believe you
have a strong stomach.

01:10:41.333 --> 01:10:43.784
- He is ... practically a skull.
- I think we better get the police.

01:10:43.819 --> 01:10:45.470
Yes, get the police.

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:48.170
Well, do we go on with the program?

01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:50.097
- It's up to you sir.
- I'm alright.

01:10:50.578 --> 01:10:52.323
I think we better carry on
in another part of the abbey.

01:10:53.159 --> 01:10:54.775
Pull that dolly over here, will you?

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.610
Get a blanket or
something to cover him up.

01:10:57.246 --> 01:10:58.659
Come on.  Quickly.

01:11:04.028 --> 01:11:06.333
- Mr Quatermass.
- Right.

01:11:15.791 --> 01:11:19.229
Alright, I want the whole abbey cleared.
Public, clergy, everyone and quick.

01:11:19.264 --> 01:11:21.450
Please, not so loud.
There's a transmission going on.

01:11:21.453 --> 01:11:23.800
Well, the transmission's coming off.
I want you all out of this place.

01:11:23.802 --> 01:11:25.172
Every second may count.

01:11:29.141 --> 01:11:33.017
... spend time for the cameras only.
This is highly out of range.

01:11:33.052 --> 01:11:35.271
Well, son, it's is an emergency.
Get this stopped.

01:11:35.272 --> 01:11:36.328
Stop?  I can't stop it!

01:11:36.329 --> 01:11:38.151
- Where's your producers?
- They're in the truck.

01:11:38.242 --> 01:11:43.325
These murals were hidden under layers of
painting and aged by the dust of time.

01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.122
Where the other reinforcements!

01:11:56.716 --> 01:11:59.503
Steve on Camera 2 standby
on stained glass window.

01:12:00.454 --> 01:12:02.842
Camera 3 on scaffolding hold it.

01:12:03.094 --> 01:12:05.045
I'm Inspector Lomax.  You got to
get your people out of the abbey!

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.912
Please.
Coming on to you Camera 3.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:09.306
Everyone in that building
maybe in deadly danger!

01:12:09.307 --> 01:12:11.033
We're on transmission!
Back on to you Camera 1.

01:12:11.034 --> 01:12:13.234
Pan up as high as you can and ...

01:12:15.642 --> 01:12:17.294
What's in the name of it?

01:12:17.344 --> 01:12:19.295
It must be 20 feet across.

01:12:21.164 --> 01:12:22.575
Kill transmission.

01:12:22.924 --> 01:12:25.786
Camera 1, hold that shot and
log off and everybody out!

01:12:27.988 --> 01:12:29.385
Hello, hello, listen.

01:12:29.527 --> 01:12:31.370
Jessica, you'll just have to
carry on as best you can,

01:12:31.371 --> 01:12:32.780
we can't go on here.

01:12:32.788 --> 01:12:35.004
Yes, just fill in will you?

01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:40.146
Quatermass, quick, in the front.

01:12:40.394 --> 01:12:42.352
It's now in the abbey.
We have to strike it now, uh?

01:12:44.776 --> 01:12:46.909
At the abbey.
There is an emergency.

01:12:46.957 --> 01:12:49.326
You saw it?
We don't know what it is.

01:12:49.476 --> 01:12:51.111
Same pattern as the one in the lab.

01:12:51.162 --> 01:12:53.380
And it was 20 times
the power of reproduction.

01:12:53.381 --> 01:12:56.020
Its nodules if it get to spore
this time, nothing will stop them.

01:12:56.021 --> 01:12:58.475
It'll break up, they'll spread by the
million wherever there's having wind.

01:12:58.723 --> 01:13:00.520
How long before
it starts reproducing?

01:13:00.523 --> 01:13:02.828
It's on the last cycle,
80 or 90 minutes.

01:13:02.829 --> 01:13:04.630
And within the hours,
everyone will be a million.

01:13:04.634 --> 01:13:05.760
He's coming lower!

01:13:05.768 --> 01:13:08.205
- We've got to stop him!
- You need a miracle to stop it now.

01:13:08.207 --> 01:13:11.760
- We've got flame throwers.
- Well, it managed to escape,
the whole of it is to kill.

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:13.327
- Dynamite.
- That would only spread it further.

01:13:13.469 --> 01:13:14.883
Stopped moving!

01:13:16.432 --> 01:13:18.208
It's barely pulsating now.

01:13:19.134 --> 01:13:20.330
That time it was out,

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:22.851
it's its last dormant stage
just before it reproduces.

01:13:22.993 --> 01:13:24.210
It's changing again.

01:13:24.215 --> 01:13:26.850
The beginning of new
spore producing hands, dusting.

01:13:26.858 --> 01:13:29.753
Well, it's hanging there,
grabbed on the scaffolding.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.750
Briscoe, I think we can stop it.

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:37.440
What now, Professor?

01:13:37.444 --> 01:13:39.760
That scaffold inside,
I want to run cables to it.

01:13:39.764 --> 01:13:40.884
Then tap the main power line.

01:13:40.885 --> 01:13:43.320
I want to send enough current
into that steel to burn it up.

01:13:43.324 --> 01:13:45.035
We've got to keep
pouring current into it.

01:13:45.036 --> 01:13:46.523
We have to melt it right
down to the ground.

01:13:46.524 --> 01:13:49.640
It's our only chance.  I want every set
of current in London diverted to here.

01:13:49.646 --> 01:13:51.099
This will bring the city to a standstill.

01:13:51.349 --> 01:13:53.950
If that thing spores before we kill it,
you won't have any city!

01:13:53.951 --> 01:13:56.499
I just hope you're right, that's
alright.  Just hope you're right!

01:14:17.544 --> 01:14:20.960
<i>Attention everybody.</i>

01:14:21.095 --> 01:14:24.362
<i>There is no cause for alarm.
I repeat.</i>

01:14:24.568 --> 01:14:26.806
<i>There is no cause for alarm.</i>

01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:29.317
<i>Please do not crowd.</i>

01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:32.445
<i>Unless you have official
business in this vicinity,</i>

01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:35.583
<i>Please listeners,
go back to your homes.</i>

01:14:35.831 --> 01:14:38.767
<i>There is nothing to see,
go back to your homes.</i>

01:15:49.791 --> 01:15:51.916
Hello Battlesea.  Standby.

01:15:57.232 --> 01:15:58.595
Switch on.

01:17:15.953 --> 01:17:17.461
Well, this time you won.

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:20.426
In my simple bible way,
I did a lot of praying.

01:17:20.835 --> 01:17:23.308
One world at a time
is good enough for me.

01:17:31.662 --> 01:17:33.657
Can we ease it all up now, sir?

01:17:40.383 --> 01:17:42.253
Is it all right, sir?

01:17:54.192 --> 01:17:56.870
Quatermass, why wasn't
I informed about all this?

01:17:59.953 --> 01:18:02.204
I only just heard, sir.
Could have been here sooner.

01:18:02.695 --> 01:18:04.116
Is there anything I can do?

01:18:04.256 --> 01:18:08.128
- Yes, Marsh.  Gonna need some help.
- Help, sir?  What are you gonna do?

01:18:08.278 --> 01:18:09.892
I'm gonna start again.

01:18:10.305 --> 01:18:16.751
