WEBVTT

00:47.798 --> 00:49.550
My name is Leanne Grayson.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.595
Leanne Grayson.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.349
Leanne Grayson.

00:59.184 --> 01:00.769
And I come from Wisconsin.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.732
My name is Leanne Grayson,
and I come from Wisconsin.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.444
My special skill is baking cakes.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.530
You're up.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.034
Sean and I thought
it might be a nice change for you

02:39.117 --> 02:40.702
to get out and about now and then.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.746
A few scheduled units every day.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.832
Do let us know your preferred hours.

02:45.916 --> 02:48.836
Anyway, now we can get started.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.303
Now, I didn't know
your thoughts on blueberries.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.430
I assure you these are sweet, not tart,

03:00.514 --> 03:02.516
but some people balk
at any fruit in a pancake.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.309
So, in that case,
we do have chocolate chips.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.813
Or berries and cream on the side,
if that's what you prefer.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.568
I'm not sure if it's supposed
to be medium or medium-high.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.069
Sean!

03:16.280 --> 03:17.281
Sean!

03:22.327 --> 03:23.412
Okay.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.166
I am so sorry
we forgot about you all weekend.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.669
You must be starving.
I am gonna make it up to you.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.006
Is someone else joining us?

03:50.939 --> 03:52.649
I thought you could use a friend.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.028
Hey.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.305
All right.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.392
Thank you.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.105
-Tobe.
-Yes, please.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.816
And Leanne.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.068
None for me.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.325
These are real delicious, Mrs. Turner.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.494
You should really try some.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.414
Morning, Chef.

04:51.250 --> 04:54.127
Tobe's always expressed
such a great interest in Leanne

04:54.211 --> 04:57.089
that I figured why not invite him over?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.683
Don't look at me that way.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.562
You scared me. What you did.

05:12.479 --> 05:15.941
I know. Harming her.
I know I went way too far.

05:16.775 --> 05:19.069
But the fact remains,
we still need to draw her out.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.405
It's our only hope
of bringing Jericho home.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.077
I thought you'd be proud of me
for at least devising a new strategy.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.793
So... how's everything?

05:37.421 --> 05:38.505
Good.

05:40.757 --> 05:45.012
I just wanted to say I'm
sorry about that night with the pizza.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.014
I didn't know anything, or...

05:47.556 --> 05:50.893
Mrs. Turner has explained the situation
very clearly to me.

05:50.976 --> 05:55.480
It's an important step
in the healing process. Acknowledgment.

05:55.939 --> 05:56.940
Right.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.569
It sounds like
you fell in with a bad crew.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.489
Same thing happened to me
in high school for a little bit.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.701
They weren't religious or anything,
but they were just really into blow.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.828
Not that I've ever done--

06:09.912 --> 06:12.039
I mean, I've tried it once, but--

06:16.877 --> 06:19.004
Jericho must be so happy to have you back.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.423
I haven't seen
that little guy around lately.

06:21.507 --> 06:25.594
Jericho's with his grandpa today.
It's healthy to bond across generations.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.678
That's true.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.391
So, I was thinking, Leanne,

06:31.475 --> 06:35.521
when everything's,
you know, okay and good,

06:36.313 --> 06:41.068
maybe you and I
can go and celebrate, if you want?

06:41.985 --> 06:43.278
Just us?

06:44.279 --> 06:47.574
Yes, it's important to have something
to look forward to.

06:47.658 --> 06:51.161
And when all of this horrible business
is behind us,

06:51.245 --> 06:54.164
Leanne will be free to go
wherever she pleases.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.624
Right.

06:58.669 --> 07:00.003
Now, wasn't that fun?

07:01.505 --> 07:04.716
And more fun could be had
if you cooperate.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.096
You can see I'm doing
what I'm supposed to, Leanne...

07:10.138 --> 07:11.765
in regards to the ransom.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.435
"Tell no one, baby lives."

07:18.939 --> 07:19.940
Wait.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.611
Here. This is for your cuts.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.530
No, thank you.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.825
Leanne, I'm not the kind of person...

07:29.908 --> 07:31.910
I'm sorry I hurt you.

07:32.703 --> 07:38.083
But you have to understand, for Jericho,
there is nothing I wouldn't do. Nothing.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.335
He's part of me, do you understand?

07:43.422 --> 07:44.882
You can lock me in now.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.859
One cup, dried apricots.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.575
One cup, chopped dates.

08:15.537 --> 08:16.788
One cup of butter.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.593
Ms. Turner?

08:29.676 --> 08:30.719
Sign here.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.388
Thank you.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.619
Sean!

08:56.912 --> 08:57.913
Look!

08:59.623 --> 09:00.874
It's fucking tiny.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.418
What does it mean?

09:05.087 --> 09:06.588
Does it have genitals?

09:06.672 --> 09:08.090
And you ordered it?

09:08.173 --> 09:09.424
I did not.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.886
We should let her out.
We promised her the morning.

09:12.970 --> 09:17.182
They've hacked our account.
They're using our credit cards.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.768
A message.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.188
What does it say?

09:23.605 --> 09:24.690
Oh, God.

09:34.950 --> 09:38.245
Ingenious. But in the future,
could we talk this shit through first?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.081
-The fuck is that?
-You didn't send it?

09:43.876 --> 09:48.046
"Bring 200,000 to the Franklinville Mall
food court, 8:00 p.m. tomorrow.

09:48.130 --> 09:49.173
Cash only."

09:53.343 --> 09:54.887
I know we need to keep her occupied.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.014
'Cause from burial,
it's a hop and a skip to homicide,

09:57.097 --> 09:59.474
but this is gonna build hope
and make things worse.

09:59.558 --> 10:00.559
Number one...

10:01.935 --> 10:03.437
I fucking told you so.

10:04.313 --> 10:06.773
I get why she did what she did.

10:06.857 --> 10:09.985
-Number two, I didn't send this.
-You didn't send it.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.613
What do you mean you didn't send it?

10:12.696 --> 10:14.615
-I didn't fucking send it.
-Then who did?

10:16.742 --> 10:17.784
No.

10:18.660 --> 10:22.164
It can't be them, though.
He didn't want money. He flat out refused.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.249
Because you didn't offer him enough.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.085
He knew he could get 200.
He just had to squeeze harder.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.922
What if we're walking into a trap?

10:30.923 --> 10:32.883
Is there a world where Dorothy
does not go to the mall

10:32.966 --> 10:34.218
with a big bag of cash tomorrow night?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.178
No, of course there fucking isn't.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.765
Then I suggest
we put our stash to good use

10:39.848 --> 10:43.268
and go with the good old-fashioned method
of paying these fuckers off.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.397
Fuck.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.992
Julian, thank God. Did you talk to Sean?

10:59.076 --> 11:00.077
I saw the note.

11:01.245 --> 11:02.621
Help me, will you?

11:02.704 --> 11:06.041
I don't know what goes in which box.
We may have to mix and match here.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.793
What a mess.

11:07.876 --> 11:11.255
I've always warned Sean,
if you're not liquid, you're a pauper.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.341
Do you think it's them?

11:15.259 --> 11:16.301
Who else could it be?

11:17.052 --> 11:20.347
Sean seems to have his doubts,
but I'm sure it is.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.765
They know we have Leanne,

11:21.849 --> 11:23.684
so of course
they'd make contact again now.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.812
Sean overthinks everything. It's them.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.816
Is this gonna be enough?

11:30.899 --> 11:32.526
Not even close.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.696
That's why I'm gonna
have to call in some favors.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.076
What's this?

11:41.159 --> 11:43.871
You know me. I always keep
a little aside for a rainy day.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.173
I'm so thankful for my little brother.

11:54.256 --> 11:56.925
Family first. Always.

12:02.931 --> 12:04.850
Welcome back to Channel 8 News.

12:04.933 --> 12:05.934
In our next segment,

12:06.018 --> 12:10.189
we have Isabelle Carrick reporting
from Philadelphia's newest restaurant.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.065
Thank you so much, Doug.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.109
Love is in the air.

12:14.193 --> 12:18.363
Thanks to our phones, it's now easier
than ever to find a dinner partner.

12:18.447 --> 12:20.824
But at this new eatery in Center City,

12:20.908 --> 12:24.494
the idea of a blind date
is taken quite literally.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.126
They say beauty
is in the eye of the beholder,

12:31.210 --> 12:34.254
but when no one can behold,
where's the attraction?

12:34.796 --> 12:38.175
In conversation? Touch? A gut feeling?

12:39.384 --> 12:41.595
Even food tastes different
when you can't see it.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.931
I'm sitting here on my first blind date

12:44.014 --> 12:48.185
with one of Philadelphia's
most eligible bachelors, Frank Clemente.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.687
He self-identifies as a picky dater...

12:51.355 --> 12:53.065
Can you believe it?

12:53.148 --> 12:54.900
What made you try this--

12:55.442 --> 12:57.819
Six hundred for a case of Ravello.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.988
Well, every little drop helps.

13:00.072 --> 13:03.951
But I paid 1,200 for it. If they'd given
me a week, I could've got a fair price.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.538
Then we wouldn't have Jericho
for another week, would we?

13:08.080 --> 13:11.750
Yeah, you're right. Every little helps.
Are we close?

13:12.334 --> 13:13.877
We're still about 20 short.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.296
Julian really came through
for us, didn't he?

13:16.380 --> 13:18.799
Yeah, he's a real sweetheart.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.426
I already have an offer from Jason Taylor.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.137
You remember what a fuss he made
when he saw you carrying it in the house?

13:24.221 --> 13:25.556
He's always coming from a spinning class.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.100
I don't want him putting
his sweaty hands all over it.

13:28.183 --> 13:31.812
It will be painful, Sean,
but I'm sure you'll weather it.

13:33.522 --> 13:36.441
Shall I leave you alone
for a moment while you say your goodbyes?

14:10.392 --> 14:13.061
You said I could be downstairs
between 9:00 and 10:00.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.230
It's now 10:45.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.930
I would like to make a cake.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.389
A cake?

14:52.935 --> 14:54.937
These are the ingredients that I need.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.522
Sean!

14:56.605 --> 14:58.440
Yeah, I'm kinda pressed today.

14:58.524 --> 15:01.693
Well, if you don't have time,
you could ask Tobe to deliver them.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.612
-I'll try.
-Sean!

15:28.136 --> 15:29.137
How long's the drive?

15:29.221 --> 15:30.806
Thirty minutes,
but she wants to get there early.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.933
-Leave nothing to chance.
-Yeah.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.727
This just doesn't feel right.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.939
You're paying a ransom
for a baby that isn't yours.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.858
-When would that ever feel right?
-Yeah.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.905
What the fuck
is Pillsbury Doughboy doing here?

15:46.989 --> 15:48.699
I asked him to bring some stuff.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.390
Were you in my closet?

16:13.974 --> 16:16.310
You didn't specify
any parameters to my walks.

16:16.393 --> 16:19.646
-You took this.
-You have so many.

16:20.564 --> 16:21.940
It looks better on her.

16:27.863 --> 16:28.864
Thank you, Chef.

16:29.740 --> 16:31.575
Are those the ingredients
that I asked for?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.369
-Tobe.
-Hey.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.039
What are you making?

16:37.873 --> 16:38.874
Cake.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.250
We should leave now.

16:40.334 --> 16:41.710
-Traffic is moderate.
-Yeah.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.170
Will you help me?

16:44.755 --> 16:48.133
Julian can watch over them. But make sure
Leanne doesn't overextend herself.

16:48.217 --> 16:49.968
She's been through so much lately.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.386
I won't stay long.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.180
Yeah, I'll make sure of that.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.855
You don't give them the bag
until they hand over the baby.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.774
And you don't let her out of your sight.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.611
She doesn't leave until Jericho is home.

17:09.238 --> 17:10.571
He's anxious.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.074
Go get him.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.216
What sort of cake you making?

17:29.299 --> 17:30.467
Fruitcake.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.094
I like chocolate best.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.805
More for us, then.

17:37.558 --> 17:41.061
So, what are we doing?
What are we making? What's the recipe?

17:42.479 --> 17:43.939
It's called a king cake.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.817
It's technically for the Epiphany.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.486
My mother used to make it on Sundays.

17:50.529 --> 17:53.282
She taught me how,
said I could use it for my pageants.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.409
You were in pageants?

17:57.286 --> 18:00.247
She said it could be my special skill
because I didn't have any.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.001
I never won.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.420
Sean and Dorothy are heading your way.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.256
What about the aunt and uncle?
Are they gonna be here?

18:09.339 --> 18:13.218
I'm not asking you to confront them.
Just hang back in the distance.

18:14.428 --> 18:16.054
You have eyes on the food court?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.685
No closer than that.
You should be all right.

18:22.227 --> 18:23.478
Call me when they show up.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.160
What happened?

18:38.619 --> 18:39.620
I'm handling it.

18:39.703 --> 18:43.248
-Did those people who were holding you--
-I don't wanna talk about that.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.084
Sorry.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.316
There's one more ingredient
to a king cake.

19:10.776 --> 19:14.905
He said it's just past
the goddess fountain, so...

19:15.280 --> 19:16.740
This is it.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.575
-Sean, Sean, we're here.
-I see it.

19:21.203 --> 19:24.706
Well, we're five minutes early,
so just sit down and...

19:24.790 --> 19:25.874
Okay.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.836
Maybe we'll order something.
It's important to look casual.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.547
Hang on. I'm muting you.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.425
Roscoe?

19:36.802 --> 19:38.136
Your sister just showed up.

19:38.971 --> 19:40.055
All right.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.516
I think we're ready.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.854
Sundays were the only day
she got out of bed.

19:48.438 --> 19:49.481
For the cake.

19:50.399 --> 19:54.236
-We'd practice. She'd have the bottle.
-The bottle?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.029
Of brandy.

19:57.489 --> 20:00.158
It's for the glaze.
If she hadn't drunk it all yet.

20:02.578 --> 20:06.748
The rule was that if I did well in my last
pageant, I got to put the baby inside.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.670
I got to do it four times.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.172
-Only four times?
-Yes.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.262
Go ahead.

20:35.611 --> 20:37.154
When it was time to eat it...

20:38.572 --> 20:40.991
my mother would put on her best dress.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.868
She'd cut the cake for us.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.039
She said whoever was most special
would get the baby.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.083
My mother was always the special one.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.293
How do you mean?

20:52.586 --> 20:54.338
She always found the baby.

20:56.006 --> 20:59.218
She would hold it up in her hand
for me to see it.

21:01.512 --> 21:03.514
And then she'd make me say it.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.392
"You're the special one!"

21:14.066 --> 21:15.526
Where's your mother now?

21:18.320 --> 21:19.321
Burning.

21:21.949 --> 21:25.202
-It's 8:20. What should we do?
-Just wait.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.829
The mall closes in 40 minutes.

21:27.913 --> 21:30.415
Then wait another 40 fucking minutes then.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.334
-Where's Leanne?
-She's baking.

21:32.417 --> 21:33.794
This could be a trap.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.629
They might've wanted us out of the house
so they could snatch her back.

21:35.712 --> 21:40.008
Don't worry, okay?
I'm on it. Just... stay online.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.524
What happened to your little friend?

21:57.109 --> 21:58.318
He had to leave.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.364
Dorothy said he couldn't stay long.

22:04.283 --> 22:06.243
He locked the door from the outside.

22:10.289 --> 22:12.457
Okay. Bedtime, Cinders.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.418
I'm cleaning.

22:14.501 --> 22:15.502
I'll do that later.

22:15.919 --> 22:18.547
Will you take the cake out of the oven
for me? To cool.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.965
I set the timer.

22:20.048 --> 22:21.967
You want me to fucking ice it for you too?

22:22.551 --> 22:25.971
After it's cool.
That's when we add the brandy glaze.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.099
Well, then maybe
I will have a slice after all.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.495
Did he just lock you in?

22:51.246 --> 22:52.748
They think it's good for me.

22:53.457 --> 22:54.833
I'm adapting.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.971
She's gone for a walkabout,
see if she can recognize anyone.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.518
She's fine. She's at a chocolate shop.

23:13.727 --> 23:16.730
That package, the little fucking baby,

23:16.813 --> 23:18.357
that came through your account.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.650
They must have hacked it.

23:19.733 --> 23:23.570
These people don't strike me as
technologically minded. They bind straw.

23:23.654 --> 23:27.824
Unless someone had access to your laptop.
What's your password?

23:27.908 --> 23:34.331
Capital J-e-r-i-c-h-o.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.166
Jericho.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.378
Your son's name.
And that's not fucking obvious at all.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.046
I told you this doesn't feel right.

23:42.214 --> 23:43.632
They're not in it for the money.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.467
It's in your history, you dumb fuck.

23:45.551 --> 23:48.720
If it wasn't you and it wasn't Dorothy,
then who else had access to this?

23:56.270 --> 23:57.437
Out!

23:58.522 --> 23:59.565
Yeah.

24:03.068 --> 24:04.820
Why would you do that to her?

24:04.903 --> 24:08.448
She changed the bedsheets for him.
She packed his little fucking monkey.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.709
Because I wanna see her get
what she deserves.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.601
They're making us leave.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.896
But we'll just go out to the parking lot.

24:38.979 --> 24:42.274
Maybe they'll feel safer
to make contact out there, do you think?

24:42.357 --> 24:43.567
Julian?

24:44.902 --> 24:46.153
Julian.

24:47.863 --> 24:50.824
Sorry, man. I can't handle this shit.

25:25.359 --> 25:27.611
This is Sean.
I can't come to the phone right now.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.752
Where is she?
