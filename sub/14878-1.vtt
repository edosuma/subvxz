WEBVTT

00:07.841 --> 00:10.503
Can you
remain still, please?
We're about to begin.

00:15.615 --> 00:17.606
Polygraph for ClA
admission.

00:19.219 --> 00:20.311
A few questions for control.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.612
Your name is Annie Walker?

00:22.889 --> 00:24.857
Yes.
You are 28 years old?

00:24.924 --> 00:26.050
Yes.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.427
You reside in
Washington, D.C.?

00:30.497 --> 00:32.259
Georgetown. Yes.

00:32.332 --> 00:33.560
You speak six languages?

00:34.134 --> 00:37.160
I travel a lot.
Languages come naturally
to me.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.636
Yes or no will be fine.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.695
Yes.

00:40.774 --> 00:44.005
Okay, Annie.
I'm going to ask you
some personal questions.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.738
Now, you told us
in your vetting interview

00:45.812 --> 00:48.303
that your last
serious relationship ended
two years ago.

00:51.684 --> 00:52.708
Yes.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.219
You met abroad?

00:55.121 --> 00:56.782
Yes. In Sri Lanka.

00:57.924 --> 01:00.552
I was backpacking.
He was teaching English.

01:01.661 --> 01:02.719
That's impulsive.

01:10.303 --> 01:11.600
Is that a question?

01:11.738 --> 01:13.035
Did you love one another?

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.805 --> 01:47.773
Yes. We were in love.

01:47.907 --> 01:48.931
The sex was good?

02:05.658 --> 02:06.682
It rocked.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.561
But it, uh...
It ended badly.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.473
Yes. It ended badly.

02:31.718 --> 02:33.015
Did that bother you?

02:37.891 --> 02:40.052
After a three-week
whirlwind romance,

02:40.126 --> 02:42.594
my supposed dream guy
left me in the middle
of the night

02:42.662 --> 02:45.256
with a cryptic note
and a $50 bar tab.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.925
Wouldn't that bother you?

02:51.237 --> 02:53.364
We're looking for a yes
or a no.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.401
Can you repeat
the question?

02:56.209 --> 02:57.540
The question is this,

02:57.610 --> 03:01.706
if you join the ClA, will you
be able to separate your work
from your personal life?

03:05.585 --> 03:06.574
Yes.

03:09.055 --> 03:10.420
Absolutely.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.761
Trainees, listen up!
This is no granny hop.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.699
This is low altitude,
2,000 feet AGL.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.671
You step, grip, and rip,
or we will be picking you up
off the ground with a spatula.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.707
Any questions? No? Good.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.710
Now. Who's first?

03:34.047 --> 03:36.106
Annie Walker.
I should have guessed.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.546
We have orders
to bring you with us.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.721
Look, whatever the problem is,
I'll retake the exercise.

04:52.792 --> 04:56.489
If it was the driving course
or the deception training
or...

04:56.629 --> 04:58.392
What was it?

04:58.564 --> 05:01.158
You did better on
the driving course than
any woman we've ever had.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.627
And better
on deception training
than anyone in a decade.

05:05.972 --> 05:06.996
Oh.

05:08.975 --> 05:12.274
So, is this about me
hooking up with my
Tae Kwon Do instructor?

05:14.414 --> 05:17.406
Because I checked
the handbook.
It's not against the rules.

05:19.752 --> 05:22.687
I'm going
to shut up now
and let you talk.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.382
I got orders from Langley.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.425
You're to be pulled
from training and sent
to headquarters.

05:26.492 --> 05:28.357
There's a case in which your
language skills are needed.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.555
What case?
I don't know.

05:30.630 --> 05:32.325
What language?
I don't know.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.731
All I know is that they
need you there today. Now.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.001
Now, like, now?

05:38.838 --> 05:39.896
Now.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.700
Oh, I still have a month
of training left.
Now.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.219
It's clear.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.355
Go ahead.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.235
Annie Walker.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.912
ClA.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.826
This late at the ClA,
you must be new.
First day?

06:37.930 --> 06:39.420
I'm Annie.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.330
Do I look that clueless?
No, not at all.

06:41.434 --> 06:44.961
I'm Conrad.
I'll show you where
to get your badge.

06:45.037 --> 06:46.368
So, is this, like,
your thing?

06:46.439 --> 06:49.499
You wait outside the entrance
and chat up girls
on their first day?

06:49.575 --> 06:50.769
Absolutely.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.038
I'm both lazy
and predatory.

06:56.215 --> 06:58.342
See the guards ahead?
They'll get you
all squared away.

07:06.893 --> 07:08.087
Conrad.

07:10.797 --> 07:14.289
You may want to get
that passkey before you try
to get through security.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.301
I'll do that.

07:19.405 --> 07:20.667
Miss.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.971
Hi. Uh, Annie Walker.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.022
Good morning.

07:39.091 --> 07:41.025
Russian desk and DPD
are on-call

07:41.093 --> 07:43.721
due to the Petrov visit
and other classified actions.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.056
This current threat matrix
is stable.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.895
However, I am
deeply troubled.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.591
Because at this critical time
for our agency,

07:50.670 --> 07:53.696
someone among us
is a traitor.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.908
Today's paper.
Classified information leaked

07:55.975 --> 07:58.569
to Liza Hearn
at the Washington Recorder.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.168
Someone here.

08:00.246 --> 08:01.975
Someone,
maybe in this room,

08:02.482 --> 08:04.347
has been seduced
by an outsider.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.679
By a reporter.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.186
In the end, all indiscretions
end in heartbreak.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.485
I, Anne Catherine Walker...

08:11.557 --> 08:13.354
When the guilty party
is caught...

08:13.426 --> 08:15.189
That I will support
and defend...

08:15.261 --> 08:18.196
And we are going to find out
who has been leaking
this information...

08:18.264 --> 08:19.561
Against all enemies...

08:19.632 --> 08:20.758
And they will be punished.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.391
So help me God.
So help me God.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.364
10:41 a.m.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.244
Annie Walker?
Yes?

08:33.312 --> 08:35.405
Auggie Anderson.
Tech ops.

08:35.481 --> 08:37.847
And your friendly neighborhood
cruise director.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.315
Walk with me.

08:42.221 --> 08:46.089
A blind guy leading you
around the ClA.
Insert ironic joke here.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.524
Jo Malone Grapefruit?

08:49.996 --> 08:51.520
Am I wearing
too much perfume?

08:51.597 --> 08:53.360
No. No, it's very subtle.

08:53.432 --> 08:54.922
A lot of the ladies
around here lay it on
so thick,

08:55.001 --> 08:56.628
it's like they're chumming
for hammerheads.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.693
Morning, Auggie.
Hey, Bea.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.739
Case in point.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.200
Everyone here
is so young.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.939
There was a hiring freeze
that was unfrozen after 9/11.

09:07.013 --> 09:10.449
Fifty percent of the Agency
has five years' experience
or less.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.610
That's both inspiring
and weirdly unsettling.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.620
You'll find this is
a weird place to work.

09:15.922 --> 09:18.857
Polygraphs every year,
no cell phones allowed
inside the building,

09:18.925 --> 09:19.949
no dating foreigners.

09:20.026 --> 09:23.462
In fact, the ClA highly
encourages dating within
the Agency.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.497
Keeps things in the circle
of trust.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.829
It's like a Club Med
without the free drinks.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.865
And the food court is
on your right.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.597
There's a Starbucks
in here?

09:31.671 --> 09:35.072
Imagine a year
of background checks
just to get a barista job.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.233
Hey, how are the legs?

09:36.309 --> 09:38.903
You know, a bag of frozen peas
would help keep down
the swelling.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.605
I'll bear that
in mind.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.910
From the inane
yet vaguely sexual banter,

09:42.982 --> 09:45.678
I take it you've already met
Conrad Sheehan.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.916
Conrad. Let's go.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.185
Welcome to the Agency, Annie.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.283
He works
for Arthur Campbell?

09:52.358 --> 09:54.622
Yeah. And he acts
like it, too.

09:55.494 --> 09:57.928
Okay. Here we are.
That's Joan Campbell's office.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.988
Head of DPD and our boss.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.096
Wait. You're not coming
with me?

10:04.637 --> 10:07.128
I'm not going in there
if I don't have to.

10:09.241 --> 10:12.506
NSA is sending over
the files you requested
and Annie Walker is here.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.212
Annie Walker.
Great to meet you.
Have a seat.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.347
Actually, we're in
a bit of a hurry.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.486
Do you know
who sent me here?

10:29.028 --> 10:30.791
I was just looking
for some clarity.

10:30.863 --> 10:33.331
Clarity? You're in the
wrong business, sweetie.

10:33.566 --> 10:35.500
A better question might be,
why do you want to be here?

10:35.568 --> 10:37.934
The ClA is not an easy place
to be a woman.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.904
I can handle
a competitive workplace.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.769
Well, you're going to be
outnumbered here 4:1.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.570
Outnumbered by men
who will hold the door
for you,

10:43.643 --> 10:45.440
call you ma'am,
and know how to fix a tire.

10:45.511 --> 10:48.947
But clarity, honesty?
That's another story.

10:49.915 --> 10:52.543
How much do you know
about the Domestic
Protection Division?

10:53.519 --> 10:55.544
I've actually
never heard of it.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.782
Good. That's the way
we want it.

10:58.858 --> 11:01.725
Welcome to the
DPD Operations Center.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.957
Every global threat that finds
its way past our borders
is dealt with here.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.896
Hello, Auggie.
Joan.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.199
Screens.
Coming up.

11:16.976 --> 11:19.206
The landscape looks
like South Ossetia.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.846
I spent six months there
helping rebuild
the opera house

11:21.914 --> 11:23.848
in Tskhinvali
after the uprising.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.907
A bleeding heart. Lovely.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.950
The figure you see on screen
is Stanislav Orlovski,
AKA Stas.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.320
Born and raised in Moscow.

11:32.391 --> 11:35.326
This satellite photo was taken
when Stas was imprisoned
in Siberia.

11:35.394 --> 11:36.793
He made a deal
with the FSB

11:36.862 --> 11:39.262
and soon became
one of their top operatives.

11:39.331 --> 11:43.324
He is a skilled assassin,
wanted in 14 countries,
and he is now ours.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.067
Stas came in
from the cold two days ago,
and he wants to talk.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.934
Talk?
He's unhappy with the new
regime at the FSB

11:49.008 --> 11:51.340
and wants to supply us
with a list of their
current targets

11:51.410 --> 11:53.435
in exchange for asylum
and compensation.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.309
It doesn't pay to hold
a grudge in the spy game.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.204
Where do I fit in?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.351
You have been assigned
as Stas' handler.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.987
You'll go to the hotel
where we have him,
wait for his call,

12:03.055 --> 12:05.353
and bring this.
A BlackBerry?

12:05.424 --> 12:07.858
That is a dedicated two-way
encrypted transponder

12:07.927 --> 12:09.588
that only looks
like a BlackBerry.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.754
He has one, you have one.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.931
You hot-synch the devices
in the room.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.364
He gets the bank codes
for his payment,
and you get the intel.

12:15.434 --> 12:16.458
And that's it.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.960
Don't have a drink with him.
Don't sleep with him.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.700
You think
I'd sleep with him?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.271
I think he'd
sleep with you.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.172
Did you call me in here
because I speak Russian?

12:25.244 --> 12:27.644
Yes, and you can also
pass for a call-girl.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.348
We want to make it
look like Stas is here
to buy guns and party,

12:31.417 --> 12:32.907
not sell secrets to us.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.844
I'm surprised there was
nobody already here
who could do that.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.786
There was. She's gone.

12:38.357 --> 12:39.790
Let's leave it at that.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.321
If you don't want the
assignment, we can send you
back to the Farm.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.591
No. No, I'm here.
I can do it.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.892
Do... Do I have to wear,
like, a costume?

12:50.669 --> 12:52.159
Hookers in D.C.
are pretty conservative.

12:52.238 --> 12:54.297
What you're wearing
now is fine.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.637
Here you go, sir.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.404
Here. You're going
to the Capitol Grand Hotel.

13:02.481 --> 13:03.709
Wait in the lounge area.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.809
When this pager vibrates,
it means we're ready
to do the meeting.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.547
It's like waiting
for a table at Friday's.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.249
Instead of sitting down
to eat a Bourbon-drenched
egg-roll fajita skillet,

13:11.323 --> 13:14.724
you're going to help us turn
one of the most dangerous men
in the world.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.293
Auggie?
Yeah?

13:16.562 --> 13:17.995
Can I ask you a question?

13:18.931 --> 13:20.558
I was Special Ops in lraq.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.431
I got out of a Humvee
to look at what I thought
was a dead dog.

13:23.502 --> 13:26.198
Next thing you know,
I'm Ray Charles.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.972
Oh. I was going to ask
what the headphones are for.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.543
Over-sharing. My bad.

13:37.216 --> 13:38.877
Grado RS2s.

13:38.951 --> 13:40.543
Great for
monitoring operations,

13:40.619 --> 13:42.849
getting real time feedback
when I'm typing,

13:42.922 --> 13:44.981
or listening to Mingus
when I'm supposed
to be working.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.786
Mingus?
Yep.

13:46.859 --> 13:49.259
I went to the Mingus tribute
festival in Stockholm.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.457
You are officially my hero.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.294
That's your ride.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.402
Wish me luck.
You don't seem like the type
to need luck. But good luck.

14:07.947 --> 14:11.508
Mmm, gotta love
those kitten heels.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.528
Would you like anything?

15:04.670 --> 15:06.501
I could get
the waiter for you.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.063
Tea? Coffee?
Glass of wine?

15:10.509 --> 15:12.033
It's 11:30 a.m.

15:12.111 --> 15:13.510
Something stronger, then?

15:16.215 --> 15:17.477
I'm good.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.781
Perhaps we could get
a drink later. A nice Cava.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.487
Cava? Are you from Spain?
Si.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.581
Valencia?
Madrid.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.626
Unfortunately, I don't think
I can get a drink with you.

15:30.696 --> 15:31.993
Hmm...

15:32.064 --> 15:34.259
Your mother warned you
not to date foreign men, huh?

15:35.034 --> 15:36.126
Something like that.

16:13.739 --> 16:14.933
Hello?

16:28.954 --> 16:30.080
Stas?

16:37.663 --> 16:38.652
Stas.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.359
Stas.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.178
English is fine.

17:01.253 --> 17:03.881
I'm in your country now,
baby.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.646
Oh. Do you have
your PDA, Stas?

17:07.992 --> 17:09.858
Oh. Oh.

17:11.230 --> 17:15.064
You have a little wardrobe
malfunction happening there.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.102
Close call. Come on.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.098
You... Do you have
your PDA, Stas?

17:22.174 --> 17:24.438
One minute.
One minute, huh?

17:26.111 --> 17:28.978
Chateau d'Yquem.
Almas lranian caviar.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.040
You're certainly rocking
on the Agency's dime.

17:33.485 --> 17:35.248
Not as good
as Russian caviar.

17:36.121 --> 17:38.646
Look, can we just focus
on the intel?

17:38.791 --> 17:40.383
Where...
Where is your PDA?

17:40.459 --> 17:43.257
It's in, uh, bedroom, kiisu.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.559
Please. Do follow me.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.268
Just keep your robe on.

17:53.405 --> 17:58.536
Look, Stas, I understand
how hard this must be
to turn on your country.

17:58.610 --> 18:00.441
And that's probably
why you've had a few...

18:00.512 --> 18:04.778
I just want you to know
that the ClA is grateful
and we're here for you.

18:05.384 --> 18:06.715
So, can we do the exchange?

18:06.785 --> 18:08.150
Shall we, uh...

18:08.987 --> 18:10.011
Hot-synch?

18:11.056 --> 18:12.489
I thought you'd never ask.

18:16.929 --> 18:17.918
Beep.

18:18.864 --> 18:22.197
Was that as good for you
as it was for me, kiisu?

18:44.690 --> 18:46.214
Get her out of there now.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.870
This way!
Let's go! Let's go!

20:05.103 --> 20:07.867
Joan, we need to keep the
information channels clear.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.807
I'm giving you all I can,
Arthur. What can you give me?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.810
I feel I've been
pretty transparent.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.506
And I feel I'm still
having to navigate
a lot of red tape.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.742
Things of this magnitude
are complex.

20:17.816 --> 20:19.579
There's complexity,
and then, there's lying.

20:19.651 --> 20:21.516
Okay. This is good.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.815
This kind of dialoging
is what this marriage needs.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.085
You know, this whole
couples counseling thing...

20:27.392 --> 20:31.453
Ultimately is useless until
Arthur gives me the name of
whoever it is he's screwing.

20:31.530 --> 20:34.294
I'm not having an affair.
How many times do we have
to go over this?

20:34.366 --> 20:36.357
You see that?
You were blinking
like crazy, Arthur.

20:36.435 --> 20:39.563
He was blinking like crazy.
Any trainee could see
that he's lying.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.936
Want me to take a polygraph?
I've got one in the closet.

20:42.341 --> 20:44.104
Yeah.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.210
Joan, we have a situation.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.780
What went wrong?
This was supposed
to be simple.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.880
It all happened so fast.

20:54.953 --> 20:58.286
I was talking to him
one minute, and the next...
The room seemed to explode.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.951
You know, some operatives
go an entire career
without seeing a bullet fired.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.061
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

21:04.596 --> 21:08.862
It's supposed to make you
realize this is unusual.
Thankfully, it all worked out.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.959
It all worked out?
Stas is dead.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.763
Bad for Stas, good for us.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.500
The Agency saves some money
and gets to delete
a known assassin

21:15.574 --> 21:18.008
from the high-security
threat list at the same time.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.601
Whatever that intel was,
it was worth killing for.

21:26.051 --> 21:27.484
What?
The intel.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.280
I didn't get it.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.684
You said you did
the hot-synch.

21:32.758 --> 21:36.023
I did. But in the confusion,
I didn't grab the device.

21:38.497 --> 21:40.727
Well, this just gets
better and better.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.525
District police and FBl
are already on the scene.

21:44.603 --> 21:46.093
Once our devices
become evidence,

21:46.171 --> 21:48.230
all the intel is corrupted.

21:48.707 --> 21:49.833
Gone.

21:50.742 --> 21:53.108
I can go back.
I can get the intel.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.472
Annie.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.177
We don't just
waltz into places,

21:56.248 --> 21:58.239
flash our badges,
and assume jurisdiction.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.841
We don't even have badges.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.079
Plus, you can't just take
evidence from an active
crime scene.

22:02.354 --> 22:03.480
She doesn't need
to take anything.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.318
She just needs to get
in the room.

22:07.092 --> 22:08.719
And what are you going
to tell the detectives

22:08.794 --> 22:10.887
and any number
of people at the hotel

22:10.962 --> 22:12.793
who will have pegged you
as a witness
or possible accessory?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.599
I'll think of something.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.738
Try not to break
or lose this one.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.867
What's the range on these?
About five feet.

22:24.943 --> 22:25.967
When I beam this one out?

22:26.211 --> 22:28.577
The other two devices will
fill up with the
harmless-looking phonebook

22:28.647 --> 22:30.410
we loaded on there,
and you'll download the intel.

22:30.949 --> 22:32.974
Ingenious. So simple.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.543
The system we devised
before you got shot at
was ingenious and simple.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.145
Now, we're just riffing.

23:08.587 --> 23:10.817
Excuse me, ma'am.
Closed crime scene.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.618
Are you in charge?

23:12.691 --> 23:15.023
You need to turn around
and go back downstairs.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.622
I was here
when it happened.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.495
Uh, what were you doing here,
Miss, uh...

23:24.569 --> 23:28.369
Truesdale.
Amber Truesdale.

23:28.473 --> 23:29.735
I had a business meeting.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.207
What kind of business
are you in?

23:31.276 --> 23:34.040
I don't want
to get in trouble.

23:34.112 --> 23:36.512
Look. We're not going
to bust you if you say
you're a...

23:37.616 --> 23:38.605
Call girl.

23:39.551 --> 23:40.916
We don't like
to use that term.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.008
Really?

23:42.854 --> 23:44.651
It's crowded in here.

23:44.723 --> 23:49.183
Yeah, well, it's amazing
what 57 high-powered rifle
shots can do to a party.

23:50.295 --> 23:52.058
Are you a detective?

23:53.131 --> 23:55.964
FBl, Agent Rossabi.

23:56.034 --> 23:59.026
And if you don't mind,
I'll ask the questions.
May I sit down?

24:02.641 --> 24:04.609
Look, I'm a good girl.

24:04.676 --> 24:07.110
I come from a church-going
family in Akron.

24:07.312 --> 24:09.746
I just wanted
to come forward
and be honest.

24:09.815 --> 24:11.942
My mother told me to always
do the right thing.

24:12.017 --> 24:14.417
Mmm. What does she say
about you being a hooker?

24:15.687 --> 24:17.848
Now, if I don't like
being called a call-girl,

24:17.923 --> 24:20.448
I certainly don't like
being called a hooker.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.755
Who was the john?
We call them clients.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.726
The agency said
his name was Boris.

24:27.332 --> 24:30.631
Russian businessman.
This was our first
party together.

24:30.702 --> 24:32.329
What's the agency?

24:32.938 --> 24:35.429
The Gold Circle Club.

24:36.842 --> 24:39.743
I can write down the number
if you want.
That would be great.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.105
Nice pen.
Thanks.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.182
302 area code.

24:48.019 --> 24:49.748
Delaware?
Wilmington.

24:49.821 --> 24:50.981
You know, tax reasons.

24:53.525 --> 24:55.584
Did you see anything
through that window?

24:56.094 --> 24:58.392
No. But I wasn't really
looking.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.322
We didn't get
a chance to...

25:01.800 --> 25:03.961
I wasn't here long.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.335
I was standing about here.

25:07.873 --> 25:10.171
Well, more here.
Excuse me, boys.

25:10.842 --> 25:11.968
Oh.

25:14.679 --> 25:17.512
The shots came
through here.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.676
And I ran out
as fast as I could.
Hmm.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.619
I don't really remember
much else.

25:25.690 --> 25:28.557
I should really get going.
Am I allowed to leave?

25:28.627 --> 25:29.958
I wouldn't leave town.

25:32.664 --> 25:33.892
Let me ask you this.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.091
Why did you
really come back?

25:37.602 --> 25:39.536
And don't give me
the, uh, "Good girl" rap.

25:46.511 --> 25:47.842
For these.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.516
Christian Louboutins
don't come cheap.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.896
FBI secure exchange,
line one.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.268
Gold Circle Club.
Where pleasure
is our pleasure.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.635
How may I direct your call?

26:21.546 --> 26:23.537
Let's see why this intel
was worth dying for.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.320
Khyber lntercept.

26:36.728 --> 26:37.717
Useless.

26:37.896 --> 26:40.456
Info on Kaladze's
political aspirations.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.556
We already knew that.

26:43.068 --> 26:46.037
Georgian troop movements
from last July.

26:46.504 --> 26:47.493
Nice Samsonite.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.539
What does
that mean?

26:49.608 --> 26:53.100
Oh, it's an old spy term
for when spooks used
to stuff their suitcases

26:53.178 --> 26:55.339
with crumpled newspaper
to make it look
like something valuable.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.775
Either Stas was too dumb
to know what good intel is,

26:57.849 --> 26:59.077
or he thought
we were too dumb.

26:59.150 --> 27:02.381
Given the fact
that he's dead now,
it's probably the former.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.283
There's nothing here
of value.

27:04.356 --> 27:07.382
Type up a closer on the Stas
file and get it to me.
We're done here.

27:07.959 --> 27:10.587
Stas is dead.
Long live Stas.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.324
Annie?

27:28.613 --> 27:30.478
Word to the wise.

27:30.548 --> 27:33.381
These pipes haven't
been cleaned since
the Johnson administration.

27:33.451 --> 27:35.351
I'd invest in
a bottle of Evian.

27:37.856 --> 27:38.845
You all right?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.251
I saw a man
get killed today.

27:43.528 --> 27:46.361
I lied to a Federal Agent.
I was shot at.

27:46.431 --> 27:49.662
Huh. Or as we call it,
"Thursday at the Agency."

27:52.570 --> 27:56.973
Asset entanglement,
evasion techniques,
deception.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.839
These are all words
they use in training.

27:58.910 --> 28:03.279
They make it
sound so clinical.
But it's not. It's...

28:04.249 --> 28:05.807
It's messy
and it's dangerous.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.881
It is messy.
And it can be dangerous.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.122
But you're doing it well.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.518
Now.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.994
It's "Miller time."

28:18.229 --> 28:19.958
Happy hour at the tavern.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.260
That's your solution?

28:23.334 --> 28:24.665
Oh, absolutely.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.431
One drink.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.209
Probably best if you drive.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.276
Hey, Auggie.
Tia.

28:41.352 --> 28:42.785
Lovely as always.

28:42.854 --> 28:45.516
Auggie, are you coming
to my party Saturday?

28:45.623 --> 28:47.352
Wouldn't miss it, Jane.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.416
Hey, Auggie.
Ladies love a blind guy.

28:49.494 --> 28:52.327
They think we don't care
about looks.
"Think?"

28:52.397 --> 28:55.924
Little secret. You don't
actually have to see a woman
to tell if she's hot.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.128
You just listen to the way
the other guys talk to her.
Take yourself, for instance.

28:59.471 --> 29:03.931
Annie Walker. I'm so sorry
to hear that you had
a hectic first day.

29:04.008 --> 29:06.602
If there's anything
the DCS office can do...

29:06.678 --> 29:08.839
I rest my case.
Thanks.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.638
Conrad, right?
You remembered.

29:11.716 --> 29:12.774
You must be very good
with names.

29:12.851 --> 29:14.944
Oh, come on.
This is getting ridiculous.

29:15.887 --> 29:17.445
Who needs
another beer?

29:18.089 --> 29:19.920
I'm just going to assume
you see me raising my hand.

29:19.991 --> 29:20.980
Mmm-hmm.

29:25.830 --> 29:28.526
Why do you think Stas tried
to sell us such bad intel?

29:29.200 --> 29:32.169
Just because a guy
can shoot a sniper rifle
doesn't make him smart.

29:32.637 --> 29:34.662
Intelligence can be
a bit of a misnomer.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.438
I guess.
So, tell me. Why did you
get into this?

29:38.576 --> 29:40.476
You certainly don't
fit the profile.

29:40.545 --> 29:42.172
I thought there was
no profile.

29:42.247 --> 29:46.047
And yet, everyone joins
for some reason.
And it sure ain't the pay.

29:49.354 --> 29:50.821
Tell me. I can take it.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.156
I traveled a lot
before I came back to D.C.
Uh-huh.

29:55.660 --> 29:58.094
I don't know
what I was looking for.

29:58.163 --> 30:00.131
I'm not sure I found it.

30:00.398 --> 30:02.628
But I got to use
my language skills.

30:03.701 --> 30:05.601
And I met a guy.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.399
Oh, it's always
about a guy.

30:07.472 --> 30:09.372
Go on.

30:10.942 --> 30:14.708
We fell in love in Sri Lanka,
and it was a tearful good-bye.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.209
A tearful farewell
at the airport,
a la Casablanca?

30:22.053 --> 30:25.648
More like he left like
the Baltimore Colts
in the middle of the night.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.083
Ouch.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.719
Anyway, I kept traveling.

30:31.796 --> 30:34.765
I went to all the places
that we said we'd go together.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.926
Tibet, Angkor,

30:37.001 --> 30:39.333
Giza, Rapa Nui...

30:40.872 --> 30:43.272
But no matter how far
I traveled,

30:44.175 --> 30:45.767
I couldn't get away
from the truth.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.243
Which was?

30:48.913 --> 30:51.006
The truth was that
I let my guard down.

30:52.417 --> 30:54.715
The ClA and the life
it offered was appealing.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.080
I wasn't going to
get burned again.

30:59.891 --> 31:01.756
Man, you do
fit the profile.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.893
I don't think we're
that far apart.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.836
I think we have
a lot of shared interests.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.204
- National security.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:22.747 --> 31:23.771
Liar.

31:24.616 --> 31:25.708
Joan.

31:26.384 --> 31:29.251
Please meet Sheila Calhoun,
legal counsel for the
Oversight Committee.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.447
Sheila, meet my wife, Joan.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.285
I can't believe you.
After all that denial.

31:34.359 --> 31:36.793
No.
This is completely
work-related.

31:36.861 --> 31:40.558
Arthur? May I have
a moment, please,
away from your girlfriend?

31:42.500 --> 31:44.161
Excuse me, Sheila.

31:47.672 --> 31:49.139
Have you lost your mind?

31:50.575 --> 31:51.599
Phone records.

31:52.043 --> 31:55.877
Thirteen phone calls
made from your scrambled
cell phone to hers.

31:55.947 --> 31:58.279
Four reservations
at various D.C. restaurants

31:58.349 --> 32:01.113
all made on your
opentable.com account.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.453
Do not tell me
I am losing my mind.

32:04.589 --> 32:07.820
You're using valuable Agency
resources to track me?

32:08.426 --> 32:09.620
That's not a denial.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.492
Why can't you be a good ClA
wife and just trust me?

32:12.563 --> 32:14.963
Because I'm not
a ClA wife.

32:15.033 --> 32:18.025
I'm a wife who works
for the ClA.

32:26.911 --> 32:31.075
Oh. Oh. Okay.
How about that girl?
She smells great.

32:32.750 --> 32:33.739
All right.

32:34.919 --> 32:37.911
Vintage lrish heart ring.
Crucifix on her neck.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.684
LSAT prep book
in her purse.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.487
Holds her liquor.
I'm guessing Boston College.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.792
Maryland accent,
not Baltimore.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.422
That's what I said, though.

32:48.633 --> 32:50.260
Traces of Dublin.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.265
I bet her parents are
first-generation off the boat.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.431
Mmm. And she's fit, huh?

32:55.573 --> 32:57.768
Her heels barely made
any noise when she was
walking by.

32:57.842 --> 33:00.140
In fact, she was walking
a little gingerly.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.803
I'd say she's training
for a marathon.

33:01.879 --> 33:04.245
Okay. Time for more drinks.

33:04.415 --> 33:06.815
Oh, my God. I was supposed
to be at my sister's house
an hour ago.

33:07.051 --> 33:09.952
I live in her guest house.
We do dinner every Thursday.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.080
That's okay.
Sorry.
I've got to go.

33:13.624 --> 33:15.285
Wait. How am I going
to get home?

33:20.598 --> 33:23.032
Excuse me. Hi.
Did you go to Boston College?

33:23.101 --> 33:24.432
I did. Did you?

33:24.502 --> 33:26.026
I did. I went
to law school there.

33:26.104 --> 33:27.833
I'm studying for the LSAT.

33:27.905 --> 33:30.738
I aced mine. I'd lend you
my study guide,
but it's in Braille.

33:31.909 --> 33:34.400
We should talk. I'm Auggie.
Louise.

33:34.479 --> 33:36.071
You have the softest hands.

34:23.795 --> 34:24.989
Who the hell are you?

34:41.512 --> 34:45.710
DEC method. Determine, evade,
counter-pursue.

35:04.669 --> 35:05.658
Oh, man.

35:16.214 --> 35:17.442
Whoa!

35:34.832 --> 35:36.891
Come on,
you piece-of-crap car.

36:03.928 --> 36:05.225
No. No!

36:38.996 --> 36:42.693
Annie!
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
Let me see.

36:42.767 --> 36:43.893
This is for you.
Okay, okay.

36:43.968 --> 36:46.596
The deal was you can
stay up until Annie
gets here, remember?

36:46.671 --> 36:48.696
Well, good night.
Good night, Annie!

36:48.773 --> 36:50.240
Bye!
See you tomorrow
in the morning.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.469
Annie,
where have you been?
I was working.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.306
Well, we're about
to start eating.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.846
Ethan is really looking
forward to meeting you.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.878
Come on.
Help me in the kitchen.

37:01.919 --> 37:05.582
What's the matter?
He's cute in an Archie Comics
sort of way.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.920
Um, I just forgot
we were doing the whole
Ethan thing tonight.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.620
I thought it was just
our usual dinner.

37:10.695 --> 37:12.060
Oh, come on.
You guys have
a lot in common.

37:12.129 --> 37:14.563
He works at the World Bank.
You work at the Smithsonian.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.224
You both have
really boring jobs.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.067
Everybody, this is
my little sister, Annie.

37:20.438 --> 37:21.632
Hi.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.632
Oh, look, there's an empty
seat next to Ethan.

37:24.709 --> 37:26.802
Annie, why don't you
take that one?

37:28.646 --> 37:30.238
Thank you.
Are you okay with that?

37:30.314 --> 37:31.781
Yeah, thanks.

37:33.718 --> 37:36.278
Well...
So, stuck in traffic?

37:36.621 --> 37:37.645
Traffic. Right.

37:37.722 --> 37:41.249
This Petrov speech has got
the entire northwest quadrant
completely gridlocked.

37:41.325 --> 37:44.488
Uh, did... did you want that?
I normally take M Street
to, uh, get to Georgetown.

37:44.562 --> 37:46.029
But they had
that blocked so...
Uh-huh.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.758
So, I ended up going
all the way up
Connecticut Avenue.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.094
You know, past the Zoo...
Wow.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.066
...and then, ended up going
down Wisconsin.

37:51.135 --> 37:53.126
Around and around
in circles today.
It was nuts.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.694
Just crazy.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.706
Can I have some wine?
Uh, red or white?

37:56.774 --> 37:59.242
Uh, whatever is closer.
Red. Sure. Here.

37:59.310 --> 38:01.676
Let me, uh...
I brought this.

38:01.746 --> 38:03.805
Oh.
It's... It's wonderful.
If you like Zinfandel.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.015
Mmm-hmm.
A little pricey.
But very good.

38:06.083 --> 38:07.550
Oh. That's...

38:08.719 --> 38:11.119
There we are.
No need to be shy.
Thank you. That's good.

38:11.989 --> 38:14.219
A toast, guys?
To Annie arriving.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.155
Oh.

38:21.232 --> 38:24.326
Seriously. Do you play
racquetball, by any chance?
You a squasher?

38:24.402 --> 38:26.563
Go for a drive and just
get out of the city.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.765
On... On the drive, you know,
I usually turn the music up.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.467
Just slip my shirt off
and just, you know...

38:33.010 --> 38:35.137
Yeah, I shuck
my own oysters.
You do?

38:35.212 --> 38:36.543
Have you ever
shucked an oyster?

38:36.614 --> 38:38.707
I'd love you to shuck
some oysters with me...

38:38.783 --> 38:41.274
Oh. (LAUGHS) Wow.
...at some point.

38:42.053 --> 38:45.545
Hey, sorry about that
chocolate mousse again.
Drive safe.

38:49.126 --> 38:51.424
Well, I think that went
pretty well.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.588
Well, that makes one of us.

38:54.265 --> 38:55.630
Good night.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.691
We're leaving in five minutes.
All right.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.888
Aunt Annie,
we're eating waffles.
Okay, guys.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.863
Sounds delicious.
Bye.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.691
I'm late. Sorry.
Okay, kids. Go get ready
for school.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.700
Dude.

39:40.077 --> 39:43.171
I'm sorry Ethan
was such a dud.

39:43.247 --> 39:44.874
It's fine.
No, I thought I vetted him,

39:44.949 --> 39:47.543
but he turned out to be
a completely different guy
than I was told.

39:47.618 --> 39:49.051
I can't believe he tried
to kiss you.

39:52.256 --> 39:53.245
What?

39:53.858 --> 39:56.190
Kiisu. I've got to go.
I've got to go.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.852
Don't be mad at me.
I said I was sorry.

39:57.928 --> 40:00.055
Well, I'm not mad.
I've just got to go.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.496
I was just trying to help,
you know?

40:01.565 --> 40:03.999
I mean, it's been ages
since you've had
a real relationship.

40:04.068 --> 40:05.330
It's weird.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.668
Okay. Now, I am mad at you.
And I've still got to go.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.842
Welcome, Ms. Hearn.
So glad you could make it.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.435
I brought along
some legal counsel
to brighten up the room.

40:15.513 --> 40:16.912
Would you like
something to eat?

40:17.148 --> 40:19.582
I'm sure you've heard
about my ClA-trained chef.

40:19.650 --> 40:22.016
Culinary lnstitute
of America.

40:22.086 --> 40:26.147
So, this is the famous
Arthur Campbell
charm offensive.

40:26.223 --> 40:27.417
So, you're not hungry.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.224
I'm not giving up
my sources.
And you shouldn't.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.362
But the people in our agency
who are talking to you

40:32.430 --> 40:34.694
are clearly unhappy
with the status quo.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.993
Maybe I could help them.

40:37.835 --> 40:40.497
I have given
these people my word.
I would go to jail for them.

40:40.571 --> 40:42.300
Oh. Let's hope it doesn't
come to that.

40:42.773 --> 40:45.298
Let's cut to the chase.
What do you want?
Everybody wants something.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.606
I just want to file
my articles in peace.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.177
I think you want more.

40:49.246 --> 40:52.181
I think you want relevancy
and access and accolades.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.083
There's nothing wrong
with that.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.616
So, what do you want?

40:56.086 --> 40:58.646
Let me be your source.
On the record?

41:00.024 --> 41:02.720
That would be tough.
And so it goes.

41:02.793 --> 41:05.421
Recognize this meeting
as me reaching out.

41:05.496 --> 41:07.088
What you do with that
is up to you.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.392
Arthur.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.729
ClA doesn't have
a monopoly on seduction.

41:12.570 --> 41:16.006
I play all the same games
that you do, except I play
them better.

41:16.073 --> 41:17.973
And with more style.

41:18.075 --> 41:19.542
But I get it.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.401
You want more
balanced coverage,

41:21.479 --> 41:23.344
and I want my sources
left alone.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.779
So, I'll agree to let
a little light in,

41:25.850 --> 41:28.045
and you'll agree
to never call me
in here again

41:28.118 --> 41:30.450
for another shameless
sit-down like this.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.712
Great meeting.

41:40.865 --> 41:42.389
Oh, she's good.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.697
I wish she was
working for us.

41:53.878 --> 41:56.176
I would have thought
that after four years
of being your teacher,

41:56.247 --> 41:57.908
you would at least
call me Mark.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.115
How have you been?
Good.

42:00.384 --> 42:01.749
Traveling, mostly.

42:01.819 --> 42:03.787
Your Russian is still
very sharp.

42:04.655 --> 42:08.921
We were disappointed you
passed up on that grant
at the Marin lnstitute.

42:10.728 --> 42:12.889
But you're here now.
I'm here now.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.955
I'm dating a guy,
a Russian guy from Moscow.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.400
Ooh. Boy, be careful
with those Muscovites.

42:19.470 --> 42:20.835
They're worse
than the ltalians.

42:22.439 --> 42:24.703
He calls me kiisu.
Like, a pet name.

42:24.775 --> 42:26.402
I've never heard that
word before. Have you?

42:26.477 --> 42:28.274
Annie, please,
don't do this.

42:28.412 --> 42:31.279
I really like this guy.
I just want to make sure
his story checks out.

42:31.348 --> 42:33.680
Please do not work
for the ClA.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.576
I'm... I'm not.

42:36.720 --> 42:40.178
Don't insult my intelligence,
and I won't insult yours.

42:40.691 --> 42:43.819
Working for these people
will lead to nothing good.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.693
I've had a lot of
gifted language students,

42:46.764 --> 42:48.732
but you are in a class
by yourself.

42:49.667 --> 42:52.033
The ClA is just going
to exploit that.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.628
But I'm not.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.631
I'm just dating this guy,
and I thought you could help.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.197
So, that's your story.

42:58.709 --> 42:59.937
And you're sticking to it.

43:00.010 --> 43:01.136
What does kiisu mean?

43:02.446 --> 43:04.209
It means kitten.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.183
But not in Russian.
It's Estonian.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.213
And it's not even
the most common way
to say, "kitten."

43:10.287 --> 43:11.447
Really?

43:11.522 --> 43:14.719
It's only used
in the small villages
in the south, near Latvia.

43:14.792 --> 43:17.226
So, somebody from Moscow
would never use that word.

43:17.328 --> 43:19.421
Someone lying about coming
from Moscow might.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.289
Thank you.
I've got to go.

43:22.866 --> 43:24.026
Annie?

43:25.502 --> 43:26.799
Be careful.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.317
Hold on! Hold on!

43:44.188 --> 43:45.280
Uh-oh.

43:45.789 --> 43:49.054
Involving civilians in ClA
matters is a serious breach
of protocol.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.923
How did you know?
How did we know?

43:51.328 --> 43:53.262
We know because we've been
following you.

43:53.397 --> 43:56.298
Given the leaks
we've had recently,
we're following everybody.

43:57.801 --> 43:59.996
Stas is still out there.
Stas is dead.

44:00.204 --> 44:03.173
It doesn't add up.
The bad intel.
The way he was hitting on me.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.606
The fact that he stood
near a window.
Is that all?

44:05.709 --> 44:08.234
And I was followed home
last night. High-speed,
tactical pursuit.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.041
I know.
That could have
been the FBl.

44:10.114 --> 44:12.605
That could have been
an unstable ex-boyfriend.
It could have been us.

44:12.750 --> 44:13.808
Was it you?

44:15.085 --> 44:16.074
No.

44:16.353 --> 44:18.617
I knew it.
Annie, this is
all circumstantial.

44:18.689 --> 44:20.122
Get off the grassy knoll.

44:20.190 --> 44:22.317
Stas was born and raised
in Moscow.

44:22.393 --> 44:25.385
The guy I met with
used the word "kiisu. "

44:25.462 --> 44:28.226
It's an Estonian word.
No Russian would ever
say that.

44:28.298 --> 44:30.357
Did you discuss this
with your professor?

44:32.036 --> 44:33.025
Yes.

44:34.138 --> 44:35.969
Gather your things.
Go back to the Farm.

44:36.040 --> 44:38.508
At this point, you're going
to be lucky if you get
a desk job in HR.

44:38.575 --> 44:40.566
You may have been washed out
of the entire program.

44:40.811 --> 44:42.142
Dismissed.

44:42.813 --> 44:43.802
Dismissed.

44:57.061 --> 44:58.892
Whoops. Perfume.

44:59.163 --> 45:01.063
Wrong bathroom.

45:01.865 --> 45:04.299
Jo Malone Grapefruit.

45:04.368 --> 45:06.859
Annie. You're here?
I had no idea.

45:08.305 --> 45:09.397
Liar.

45:09.773 --> 45:10.762
How are you doing?

45:12.309 --> 45:13.298
I'm fine.

45:15.279 --> 45:16.268
Liar.

45:18.816 --> 45:20.875
You know, I remember
when I first started
at the Agency,

45:20.951 --> 45:23.545
I was so freaking confused
by everything.

45:23.821 --> 45:26.551
And this was
before my accident.
I could still see but...

45:27.324 --> 45:28.848
The protocol...

45:29.093 --> 45:30.492
Bureaucracy...

45:31.662 --> 45:35.428
The people I thought were
mentors turned out to be
jerks, and vice-versa.

45:36.333 --> 45:37.493
I was a mess.

45:39.937 --> 45:42.303
Of course, back then,
I could at least read
the bathroom signs.

45:49.179 --> 45:50.703
So, what's the secret?

45:52.316 --> 45:53.510
Well...

45:55.018 --> 45:57.077
I'm not sure there
really is one secret.

45:58.021 --> 46:01.354
But I find that it helps
to keep a healthy sense
of humor.

46:02.326 --> 46:04.453
And a bottle of Patron
in my desk drawer.

46:08.198 --> 46:11.031
Annie, if Joan was going
to fire you, she would have
already done it.

46:12.136 --> 46:14.900
The Agency likes people
who take initiative.

46:15.005 --> 46:16.939
It's kind of a weird
push-pull thing.

46:20.244 --> 46:21.768
In that case...

46:25.816 --> 46:26.942
I need your help.

46:44.968 --> 46:47.368
Hey. Can you take
a picture of us?

46:47.638 --> 46:50.004
Try and get
the Capitol Building
in the background if you can.

46:50.073 --> 46:51.062
Sure.

46:54.411 --> 46:55.571
Smile.

46:56.847 --> 46:58.712
Here you go.
Thank you.

46:59.883 --> 47:01.111
Thanks.

47:06.957 --> 47:08.754
Wintergreen Listerine
Breath Strips?

47:08.826 --> 47:10.418
I'm improvising.

47:10.727 --> 47:13.924
I once accidentally washed
a pair of jeans
with these in the pocket.

47:14.097 --> 47:15.826
When I fished them out...

47:16.333 --> 47:19.131
I couldn't get them off
my fingers.

47:21.205 --> 47:23.366
This is never going to work.

47:24.441 --> 47:26.170
There's only one way
to find out.

47:29.513 --> 47:30.502
Huh.

47:31.915 --> 47:33.075
Annie?

47:41.625 --> 47:43.058
You know,
when I was talking
about initiative,

47:43.126 --> 47:44.593
I meant, like, showing up
for work early,

47:44.661 --> 47:46.492
buying donuts for everyone
once in a while.

47:46.563 --> 47:48.861
We need to blend in.
You need to sell this.

47:48.932 --> 47:50.729
Talking doesn't help.

47:51.134 --> 47:52.123
We're clear.

47:53.437 --> 47:56.600
Annie, you forgot my shoes.
I'm supposed to walk around
the morgue barefoot?

47:57.808 --> 47:59.298
We just need to find Stas.

48:02.512 --> 48:04.673
Stas spent ten years
in a Siberian prison.

48:05.415 --> 48:07.383
He has the tattoos
to prove it.

48:08.185 --> 48:09.709
And this guy...

48:13.023 --> 48:14.581
Clean as a Boy Scout.

48:14.992 --> 48:16.357
I knew it.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.126
Stas is still alive.

48:18.862 --> 48:21.023
I should have noticed it
when his robe came off.

48:21.098 --> 48:22.588
Wait. His robe came off?

48:22.666 --> 48:24.861
Freeze! FBl!

48:24.935 --> 48:26.994
Now, tell me.

48:27.070 --> 48:29.129
What is a call-girl

48:29.773 --> 48:31.866
doing at a D.C. morgue?

48:39.917 --> 48:41.646
Paying my respects.

48:53.997 --> 48:55.089
So...

48:57.267 --> 48:59.030
You're still telling me
you're a call girl?

48:59.102 --> 49:01.070
I'm still telling you
I don't like that term.

49:01.138 --> 49:02.833
Okay. Who's the blind guy?

49:03.340 --> 49:04.329
He's a client...
Client.

49:04.408 --> 49:07.775
A john, as they say.
Which is ironic,
since my name is John.

49:08.812 --> 49:12.475
Okay. Uh, what were you
two doing in the morgue?

49:12.549 --> 49:14.779
I had mentioned to John
about yesterday,

49:14.851 --> 49:16.819
almost getting killed
at the Capitol Grand.

49:16.887 --> 49:18.946
I knew he was a bit
of a fetishist.

49:19.022 --> 49:20.114
I thought
it might turn him on.

49:21.591 --> 49:24.583
And seeing that dead body
really turned me on.

49:24.928 --> 49:27.055
You're blind.

49:28.332 --> 49:30.357
What are you, "sight-ist"?

49:30.434 --> 49:33.130
I think I'd like to speak
to someone a little more
open-minded!

49:33.203 --> 49:34.932
There's one more thing
you should know.

49:35.272 --> 49:38.764
Really? And what is that?

49:39.943 --> 49:42.673
We are extremely discreet.

49:43.347 --> 49:47.181
We have a number of Federal
employees and civil servants
on our client list.

49:47.918 --> 49:49.249
I'm just putting
that out there.

49:51.088 --> 49:52.817
Let me
get this straight.

49:52.889 --> 49:57.053
You're propositioning me
during an interrogation?

49:57.127 --> 50:01.564
See, you keep using
all those clinical terms,
and it's dampening the mood.

50:07.004 --> 50:07.993
I'll be back.

50:21.685 --> 50:23.380
I just got a call
from my boss' boss.

50:24.721 --> 50:28.088
A man I've never
talked to in my entire
career just called me.

50:28.825 --> 50:30.486
Congratulations.
You must be
doing a good job.

50:30.560 --> 50:34.326
A man I've never talked to
told me to release you
and your friend.

50:35.165 --> 50:38.828
Maybe your boss' boss
is a Gold Circle client.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.637
Okay. Here's what I think.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.400
I think you both
work for the Agency.

50:44.508 --> 50:46.476
Uh...
No, I know. I know.

50:46.543 --> 50:48.238
You don't know what
I'm talking about, right?

50:48.645 --> 50:51.011
I was going to say
you don't know what
you're talking about.

50:51.081 --> 50:53.481
Okay. You work
for the ClA.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.040
Yeah.

50:55.218 --> 50:58.381
You work for the ClA,
and you should be sharing
information with us anyway.

50:58.455 --> 51:00.980
Somehow, you got involved
with this Russian guy.

51:01.058 --> 51:03.458
And instead of
working with the Bureau,
you decided to go it alone.

51:03.527 --> 51:05.427
Only you got caught.

51:05.495 --> 51:08.293
And now,
some shadowy superior

51:08.365 --> 51:11.198
who goes to the
Metropolitan Club
with our director

51:11.268 --> 51:12.633
has got to call
to get you released.

51:13.170 --> 51:15.661
The operative word
being "released."

51:21.378 --> 51:23.107
So, what did the
NSA come up with?

51:23.180 --> 51:25.580
Well, we ran the wiretaps
on Miss Calhoun
from Oversight.

51:25.649 --> 51:26.638
And?

51:26.716 --> 51:29.276
And, um... It's all
on the up-and-up.

51:29.719 --> 51:32.586
All conversations with Arthur
are completely work-related.

51:32.656 --> 51:33.953
It's actually pretty boring.

51:34.825 --> 51:35.985
Is that so?

51:36.660 --> 51:39.823
You should be happy, Joan.
Your husband is not
having an affair.

51:40.363 --> 51:42.456
Thanks, Paul.
I owe you one.

51:43.266 --> 51:44.665
Yes, you do.

51:51.641 --> 51:52.903
What is it, Conrad?

51:52.976 --> 51:55.410
A heads up
on tomorrow's
front page.

51:57.047 --> 51:59.277
How many sources
does she have?

51:59.783 --> 52:00.875
What else?
You're hovering.

52:00.951 --> 52:05.388
The DNl called.
He wants to see you in his
office first thing tomorrow.

52:07.657 --> 52:08.988
Thank you.

52:09.526 --> 52:11.050
You were right.

52:11.128 --> 52:12.152
Really?

52:12.229 --> 52:13.560
Don't make me
say it twice.

52:14.064 --> 52:17.056
We got a hold of the body
after you two were pinched
at the morgue.

52:17.167 --> 52:18.498
Not good, by the way.

52:18.869 --> 52:20.166
We're sorry about that.

52:20.237 --> 52:22.535
Two days on the job,
and you already have him
apologizing for you?

52:22.606 --> 52:24.130
She likes Mingus.

52:24.674 --> 52:26.403
I'm sorry.
Later.

52:26.476 --> 52:28.774
We cross-checked
DNA samples.
It's not Stas.

52:29.212 --> 52:30.201
Who is it?

52:30.280 --> 52:32.510
Some patsy
Stas must have bribed
to pretend to be him.

52:32.582 --> 52:34.709
Clearly, he omitted the
"getting shot" of it all.

52:34.784 --> 52:36.775
And Stas was the one
who was doing the shooting?

52:36.887 --> 52:38.013
He is an assassin.

52:38.188 --> 52:39.416
Why would he fake
his own death?

52:39.489 --> 52:41.150
Not for the money.
The transfer didn't
go through.

52:41.224 --> 52:43.624
It wasn't to signal to us
he was dead. Too veiled.

52:43.693 --> 52:45.786
We're over-thinking it.
Like you said,
he's an assassin.

52:45.862 --> 52:48.797
That means everything
he does goes towards one goal.

52:48.899 --> 52:51.925
Oh, man. Is Stas
still on the HSTL?

52:54.971 --> 52:56.302
Let's see.

52:58.808 --> 53:02.801
"Deceased". If everybody
thinks he's dead,
nobody's looking for him.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.543
And if nobody's looking
for him, he can do what
he really came here to do,

53:06.616 --> 53:08.481
which is kill someone.

53:09.085 --> 53:10.074
What's the threat matrix?

53:10.353 --> 53:11.684
Coming up.

53:13.890 --> 53:16.222
The President is abroad.
Congress is out of session.

53:20.564 --> 53:23.965
Petrov. An outspoken
Russian journalist
visiting D.C.

53:24.034 --> 53:26.093
It's classic
FSB tactics.

53:26.169 --> 53:28.194
Half their assassinations
go down abroad.

53:28.271 --> 53:31.502
Petrov's at an awards dinner
at the Smithsonian right now.

53:31.575 --> 53:33.202
We've got to get
him out of there.

53:33.276 --> 53:34.834
Go get him, girls.

53:48.825 --> 53:49.814
Arms, please, sir.

54:07.410 --> 54:08.570
Thank you, Victor.

54:13.116 --> 54:14.208
I really enjoyed it.

54:14.284 --> 54:15.273
Thank you.

55:00.830 --> 55:02.491
Petrov is secure.
Stand down.

55:02.565 --> 55:05.227
Stas probably knew
we were on to him
and didn't show up.

55:05.635 --> 55:06.727
Annie.

55:08.571 --> 55:10.402
Ethan.
Don't worry.
I'm not stalking you.

55:12.275 --> 55:13.902
Uh, Petrov... He's a friend
of the World Bank's. So...

55:13.977 --> 55:15.842
Oh.
Sorry about last night.

55:15.912 --> 55:17.243
You know,
too much "Zin."

55:17.314 --> 55:19.578
Would you do me the honor
of letting me pay for
the dry cleaning bill?

55:19.649 --> 55:20.877
It was only
chocolate mousse.

55:21.051 --> 55:22.075
Yeah, but still...

55:22.152 --> 55:23.847
Hey, you know,
you Smithsonian people
really know

55:23.920 --> 55:25.148
how to throw
a good party.

55:25.655 --> 55:28.021
So, are you, uh,
working or are you,
uh, playing?

55:28.091 --> 55:31.151
Working. Actually,
could you excuse me
for a second?

55:31.227 --> 55:32.285
Uh, work stuff.

55:32.495 --> 55:33.484
Right.

55:56.119 --> 55:57.108
You all right?

56:05.895 --> 56:06.953
Call security!

57:33.249 --> 57:34.910
Move, and I'll kill you.

57:37.353 --> 57:38.786
I believe you, Stas.

57:41.958 --> 57:42.982
Let's think this through.

57:43.059 --> 57:44.219
The ClA loves to negotiate.

57:44.294 --> 57:46.353
I... I could shepherd you
into Langley myself.

57:46.429 --> 57:47.418
Keep walking.

57:48.364 --> 57:50.423
I knew that
Spanish accent was off.

57:50.500 --> 57:51.694
You're getting sloppy.

57:51.768 --> 57:54.828
I promise you
I'll work on that
after you're dead.

57:56.272 --> 57:57.500
Get down on your knees.

59:42.278 --> 59:44.246
The lntelligence
Commendation Award.

59:44.714 --> 59:47.046
For your work
on neutralizing
an enemy spy.

59:48.418 --> 59:49.407
Thank you.

59:49.886 --> 59:52.684
I look forward to
coming back to the Agency
after I finish my training.

59:52.755 --> 59:54.416
Oh, you're not
going back to the Farm.

59:54.490 --> 59:56.424
We're going to be
keeping you here
at the DPD.

59:56.859 --> 59:58.451
Your country needs you.

59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.458
Oh. Thank you.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.963
Joan, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:12.730
Yeah, of course.

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.868
On the platform,
it all happened so fast,

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:17.674
but I could have sworn
that Stas was killed by...

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.040
...somebody I knew.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:21.809
Someone you knew?

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.408
Someone I met
while traveling.

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.053
Annie, you've been
through a lot.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.657
The man who killed Stas
is Agent Baldwin over there.

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.591
You're lucky
he got there
when he did.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:35.454
You might want
to go thank him.

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:39.792
And you're going to have
to give that back.

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.302
Awards stay here
in the vault.

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:54.774
The Agency giveth
and the Agency taketh away.

01:00:56.219 --> 01:00:57.709
You were right.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.618
This is
a weird place to work.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:02.590
Come on.
Let's go scarf down a few
more of these cheese cubes

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.149
before they take those away.

01:01:08.464 --> 01:01:09.954
So, you're telling me
he's back already.

01:01:10.033 --> 01:01:12.331
The moment
we brought her in,
he resurfaced.

01:01:12.402 --> 01:01:14.063
Thankfully, he took out
Stas for us.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.761
Ben Mercer.

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.863
They must have had
a hell of a time
in Sri Lanka.

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:19.832
Should we mobilize
an ops team?

01:01:19.909 --> 01:01:20.967
No, not yet.

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:22.773
If we move too quickly,
he could slip away again.

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:25.109
Keep the girl working.
Keep her out there.
Let's see what he does.

01:01:25.548 --> 01:01:27.413
Hopefully, she'll lead us
right to him.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.646
Arthur.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.416
No, this meeting
is over, Joan.

01:02:05.254 --> 01:02:07.017
Hi.
Hi.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.016
Are you okay?

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:14.389
I'm fine.
A stapler accident.

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:15.828
I'm such a klutz.

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.164
I'm sorry
about this morning.

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:22.795
No, I'm sorry.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:25.397
I just... I wanted
to introduce you
to someone cool,

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.772
and Ethan was...

01:02:27.777 --> 01:02:28.766
...not.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:30.901
It's okay.

01:02:31.114 --> 01:02:32.672
He said he'd pay
for the dry cleaning.

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.544
Wow.

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.609
Straight to
the Cherry Garcia.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.177
Rough day, huh?

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.355
No. I'm fine.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.085
You are such
a horrible liar.

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:45.150
You'd make, like,
the worst spy ever.

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.489
You want to talk about it?

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.536
Not tonight.

01:02:56.305 --> 01:03:02.525
