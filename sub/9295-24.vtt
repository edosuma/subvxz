00:12.738 --> 00:15.273
As we gather together

00:15.341 --> 00:18.409
for this great occasion,
we must not forget

00:18.477 --> 00:22.914
that we all stand in the shadow
of Omar Hassan's

00:22.982 --> 00:24.582
tragic death.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.484
But...

00:26.552 --> 00:30.321
the peace agreement we're
about to sign will be

00:30.389 --> 00:32.122
his living memorial.

00:32.191 --> 00:35.260
His courage brought us all
to this historic day,

00:35.327 --> 00:36.661
and his vision

00:36.729 --> 00:41.432
will continue to guide us
as we move into the future...

00:41.500 --> 00:43.334
together.

00:43.402 --> 00:46.070
So on behalf
of the people of Russia,

00:46.138 --> 00:47.805
I extend the open hand
of friendship

00:47.873 --> 00:50.608
to my partners in peace:

00:50.676 --> 00:51.976
President Taylor,

00:52.044 --> 00:53.811
President Hassan.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.980
Thank you very much.

00:56.048 --> 00:58.516
(reporters shouting questions)

00:58.584 --> 01:00.184
SECRETARY GENERAL: There'll
be time for questions

01:00.252 --> 01:02.120
after the signing
ceremony. Please, please.

01:02.187 --> 01:04.563
DALIA: If there's
nothing more,

01:04.598 --> 01:06.424
I will see you both
at the signing.

01:09.094 --> 01:15.199
It appears I am not the only one
who does not want to be here.

01:15.467 --> 01:18.369
Mrs. Hassan is distraught.

01:18.437 --> 01:21.239
Understandably- her husband
was killed six hours ago.

01:21.306 --> 01:24.208
Is that why she refuses
to look at me?

01:26.145 --> 01:28.146
She knows.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.551
A reporter told her
of your complicity

01:33.619 --> 01:35.419
in her husband's murder.

01:35.487 --> 01:38.456
Dalia came to me.

01:38.524 --> 01:41.325
And you confirmed
this journalist's allegations.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.494
I told her the truth.

01:43.562 --> 01:47.098
And yet, knowing what she knows,
she's still here.

01:48.467 --> 01:52.904
Mrs. Hassan understands
the benefits of peace.

01:52.971 --> 01:56.374
Because you helped her
come to that understanding.

01:56.441 --> 01:58.376
Excuse me, Madam President.

01:58.443 --> 02:00.244
(speaking Russian)

02:02.247 --> 02:06.617
Whatever it was you said
to Mrs. Hassan to keep her here

02:06.685 --> 02:09.086
must have been very convincing.

02:11.123 --> 02:13.791
Take your call, Yuri.

02:16.061 --> 02:18.062
(speaking Russian)

02:31.443 --> 02:33.010
Charles.

02:33.078 --> 02:35.479
Yuri. We need to talk.

02:35.547 --> 02:37.415
So talk.

02:37.482 --> 02:39.483
Uh, it's a
sensitive matter;

02:39.551 --> 02:41.953
something that, uh, that can't
be discussed on the phone.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.221
All right.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.522
SUVAROV:
Come to my suite.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.324
LOGAN:
No. You need to come to mine.

02:46.391 --> 02:48.125
SUVAROV:
Why?

02:48.193 --> 02:50.228
LOGAN:
Just trust me, Yuri.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.696
SUVAROV:
Trust you?

02:51.763 --> 02:53.164
I don't need
to remind you

02:53.232 --> 02:55.533
that it is in our
mutual self-interest

02:55.601 --> 02:58.502
to make sure that certain
secrets stay secret.

02:58.570 --> 03:00.171
Stop talking
in riddles, Charles.

03:00.239 --> 03:02.240
I don't have
time for this.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.508
There's a possible leak
inside of your camp,

03:04.576 --> 03:08.846
<i>which is why we need
to discuss this in my office.</i>

03:08.914 --> 03:10.915
I'll be right there.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.919
(phone beeps)

03:16.455 --> 03:18.055
I hope I was

03:18.123 --> 03:19.423
convincing enough for you.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.525
You're a world-class liar;
I would have expected

03:21.593 --> 03:23.694
nothing else.

03:23.762 --> 03:25.796
What exactly do you
think you're doing

03:25.864 --> 03:28.899
by killing Suvarov?

03:28.967 --> 03:30.768
Getting justice
for Renee Walker?

03:30.836 --> 03:33.304
Yes, and for all the other
people that died today

03:33.372 --> 03:34.839
trying to protect this country.

03:34.906 --> 03:39.076
Now, sit at the desk
and keep the line open.

03:39.144 --> 03:42.313
Jack, the audio file you
recorded- we can use it

03:42.381 --> 03:43.547
to expose Suvarov.

03:43.615 --> 03:45.016
We can use the CTU servers

03:45.083 --> 03:46.784
to distribute it
to every government agency

03:46.852 --> 03:49.754
and media outlet. President
Taylor's already censored the press.

03:49.821 --> 03:51.355
NSA's putting up firewalls.

03:51.423 --> 03:53.424
Arlo's working on getting
through them right now.

03:53.492 --> 03:54.725
The president can't lock down

03:54.793 --> 03:56.794
every media outlet.
(phone ringing)

03:56.862 --> 03:57.828
That's Cole.

03:57.896 --> 03:59.096
If I don't answer that,

03:59.164 --> 04:00.631
he's sending a
TAC team in here.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.166
It'll be too late.

04:02.234 --> 04:04.035
I'm gonna finish
what I've started.

04:05.971 --> 04:07.972
You've reached
Chloe O'Brian's voicemail.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.641
Please leave a message.
(phone beeps off)

04:10.709 --> 04:12.710
(indistinct radio chatter)

04:20.017 --> 04:21.584
Delta groups, this is base.

04:21.653 --> 04:23.521
Come in, Delta. This
is Delta One. Go ahead.

04:23.588 --> 04:25.222
I need you to deploy
all available TAC units

04:25.290 --> 04:26.757
to the 22nd floor
of the Hart Building.

04:26.825 --> 04:29.627
I have intel on a possible sniper.
You got I.D. on this hostile?

04:29.695 --> 04:31.128
Affirmative.

04:31.196 --> 04:32.596
It's Jack Bauer.

04:33.799 --> 04:35.566
With regard to Bauer, sir,

04:35.634 --> 04:38.135
the standing order
is to use lethal force.

04:39.171 --> 04:40.838
The order stands.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.273
Copy that.
We're on our way.

04:42.341 --> 04:44.842
Delta teams two and three,
this is a priority mobilization.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.143
The suspect is Jack Bauer.

04:46.211 --> 04:47.578
Considered armed and dangerous.

04:47.646 --> 04:49.347
Maintain
shoot-on-sight protocol.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.550
TAC AGENT: Copy that. We have
authorization for lethal force.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.424
CHLOE:
Listen to me, Jack. Please.

05:00.492 --> 05:01.826
Jack, put down
your rifle,

05:01.893 --> 05:03.527
and let me walk you out of here

05:03.595 --> 05:05.363
before they get here.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.832
Killing Pavel and Novakovich
was one thing,

05:07.899 --> 05:09.266
but killing Suvarov?

05:09.334 --> 05:11.669
The Russians will consider an
assassination of their president

05:11.737 --> 05:13.671
on American soil an act of war.

05:13.739 --> 05:16.307
He facilitated a terrorist
attack against this country.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.509
<i>That's an act of war.
He's a murderer.</i>

05:18.577 --> 05:20.611
You're provoking a war
with a nuclear-armed country.

05:20.679 --> 05:21.812
Shut up, Chloe!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.814
Or what?
You're gonna kill me, too?

05:26.318 --> 05:27.685
These people need to be stopped.

05:27.753 --> 05:29.120
They need to be
held accountable.

05:29.187 --> 05:30.321
They brought this on themselves.

05:30.389 --> 05:31.655
I don't need to remind you

05:31.723 --> 05:32.990
of the collateral damage
you're causing.

05:33.058 --> 05:34.325
Not to mention
the innocent lives

05:34.393 --> 05:35.626
that are at stake.

05:35.694 --> 05:37.962
(footsteps approaching)

05:38.029 --> 05:39.497
(knocking)

05:39.564 --> 05:41.966
Sir, uh, President
Suvarov is outside.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.135
He says you're expecting him.

05:50.442 --> 05:52.009
Excuse me, sir?

05:52.077 --> 05:53.611
Yes.

05:53.678 --> 05:56.180
I heard you.

05:56.248 --> 05:57.915
Send him in.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.887
You're gonna start a war
because you lost someone?

06:02.954 --> 06:04.422
This isn't about me.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.791
Renee wouldn't
want you to do this.

06:06.858 --> 06:09.260
I said shut up, Chloe!
You know she wouldn't.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.429
She would want you
to use that data card

06:11.496 --> 06:12.930
to get justice.
The last thing

06:12.998 --> 06:15.933
Renee would want is for you
to start a war in her name.

06:16.001 --> 06:20.004
Jack, please, don't dishonor
her memory like this.

06:22.474 --> 06:23.941
We should
speak alone.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.109
Yes, of course.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.178
(panting)

06:35.253 --> 06:39.423
This person, the one you say
is leaking information...

06:39.491 --> 06:41.492
who is it?

06:44.863 --> 06:48.732
SUVAROV (slowly):
I'm talking to you.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.769
(Jack panting)

06:53.472 --> 06:55.406
Okay, we'll do
it your way.

06:55.474 --> 06:57.408
But you got to promise me
you'll see this through.

06:57.476 --> 06:59.109
Because there's no way I'm
getting out of this building alive.

06:59.177 --> 07:00.878
Jack... You got
to promise me that

07:00.946 --> 07:02.112
you will see this through

07:02.180 --> 07:04.515
and that you will do
exactly what I say.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.350
I need to hear it!

07:06.418 --> 07:09.119
I promise.

07:13.158 --> 07:14.992
I'm, uh...

07:15.060 --> 07:18.362
I'm sorry...
for calling you so urgently.

07:18.430 --> 07:21.532
I was, uh, mistaken.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.569
My concern appeared
to have been unfounded.

07:25.637 --> 07:28.706
I- I got a call from my
source just a moment ago.

07:28.773 --> 07:31.909
Um, um...
his information was wrong.

07:31.977 --> 07:36.013
I'm so sorry for wasting
your time, Yuri.

07:36.081 --> 07:38.315
Gregor. Vasily.

07:46.324 --> 07:49.159
LOGAN:
See you after the signing.

07:53.698 --> 07:55.499
Find Pillar.

07:56.701 --> 07:59.003
Sweeping equipment 22nd floor!

08:01.506 --> 08:03.140
CHLOE: Jack, the TAC
team's almost here.

08:03.208 --> 08:06.844
I just need to make it
to mobile command.

08:06.912 --> 08:09.914
You won't even get that far; you
won't make it out of the building.

08:09.981 --> 08:12.283
You and Cole found me first
by circumventing CTU.

08:12.350 --> 08:14.585
If Logan hasn't figured that
out yet, he will soon enough.

08:14.653 --> 08:17.855
CTU gave you a standing order
with regards to me:

08:17.923 --> 08:18.856
to terminate
with extreme prejudice.

08:18.924 --> 08:20.624
If you don't shoot me,

08:20.692 --> 08:22.026
that file's not going anywhere.

08:22.093 --> 08:24.194
You need to shoot me
and shoot to kill!

08:24.262 --> 08:25.496
Point it at me.

08:25.564 --> 08:26.764
Point it!

08:26.831 --> 08:27.998
And when they come
through the door, tell them

08:28.066 --> 08:30.134
you found me at the sniper
rifle, I turned on you,

08:30.201 --> 08:32.635
and you opened fire. Don't ask
me to do something I can't do.

08:32.703 --> 08:34.270
Damn it, Chloe,
pull the trigger!

08:34.339 --> 08:35.873
We are running
out of time.

08:35.941 --> 08:37.508
They are gonna
find us soon.

08:37.576 --> 08:38.808
You said you'd do
exactly what I would say,

08:38.876 --> 08:39.809
that you would
follow this through.

08:39.878 --> 08:40.811
Now, pull the trigger!

08:40.879 --> 08:42.279
I can't!
Yes, you can,

08:42.347 --> 08:43.280
and you will!

08:43.347 --> 08:44.615
Now, pull the trigger!
No!

08:44.683 --> 08:45.716
Damn you, Chloe,

08:45.784 --> 08:47.017
pull the trigger!
Jack...

08:47.085 --> 08:48.886
We are running out of time!
Pull the trigger!

08:48.954 --> 08:50.688
Please don't make me
do this. Chloe, I know

08:50.755 --> 08:52.222
how hard this is for you,
but if you care

08:52.290 --> 08:53.624
about me at all,
you will pull the trigger.

08:53.692 --> 08:55.492
Do it! Chloe,
I'm sorry, I can't.

08:55.560 --> 08:56.760
pull the trigger!
No, Jack!

08:56.828 --> 08:58.195
Pull the trigger!
I'm not gonna do it!

08:58.263 --> 08:59.797
Damn you!
(gunshot)

09:00.932 --> 09:03.067
(door bursts open)

09:03.134 --> 09:05.536
What happened? He
drew his weapon.

09:05.604 --> 09:06.904
I shot him first.

09:06.972 --> 09:08.072
Jack Bauer's down
with a gunshot wound

09:08.139 --> 09:09.740
to the upper chest.
Send medical to our position.

09:09.808 --> 09:12.376
I repeat, Bauer is down.

09:25.916 --> 09:28.350
(phone rings)

09:28.418 --> 09:29.985
Chloe, I've been trying
to reach you.

09:30.053 --> 09:33.022
Burke's reporting you shot Jack.
I had to. Listen...

09:33.089 --> 09:34.657
I'm on my way there right now.
No.

09:34.724 --> 09:36.659
I need you at
mobile command.

09:36.726 --> 09:38.460
Tell me what's happening.
I have the recording

09:38.528 --> 09:39.795
of Logan and Suvarov's
conversation.

09:39.863 --> 09:41.030
Jack gave it to me.

09:41.097 --> 09:43.299
If he gave it to you,
why did you shoot him?

09:43.366 --> 09:44.900
I'll explain later.
Right now, you need to make sure

09:44.968 --> 09:47.236
that Arlo is ready
to upload that file.

09:48.271 --> 09:49.805
Yeah, okay.

09:49.873 --> 09:51.840
Just...
What's Jack's status?

09:51.908 --> 09:53.842
EMTs are working
on him right now.

09:53.910 --> 09:55.711
Is he going to make it?
I don't know.

09:55.779 --> 09:57.713
I'll explain everything
to you when I get there.

09:57.781 --> 09:58.881
I'll see you soon.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.731
BURKE:
Ms. O'Brian!

10:15.799 --> 10:18.067
NYPD found Mr. Pillar
in the garage.

10:18.134 --> 10:20.269
He was locked in the back
of his SUV.

10:20.337 --> 10:22.371
He wants me to
hold you here. Why?

10:22.439 --> 10:24.039
He's been apprised
of the situation,

10:24.107 --> 10:25.507
and he wants
to debrief you.

10:25.575 --> 10:27.543
We can do it later at CTU.

10:27.611 --> 10:28.978
I'm still running
security here. I'm sorry.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.879
Ms. O'Brian, he was adamant.

10:30.947 --> 10:32.548
I've got to get back
to mobile command.

10:32.616 --> 10:35.184
Ma'am, his authority,
comes from the president.

10:35.251 --> 10:36.619
If you want
to make a call

10:36.686 --> 10:38.320
to the White House,
we can do that.

10:40.357 --> 10:42.324
When will he be here?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.493
He's on his way up here now.

11:15.525 --> 11:18.861
Hmm, I'm sure it was a terrible
ordeal, Mr. President.

11:21.164 --> 11:22.464
But they told me Bauer's down.

11:22.532 --> 11:24.466
It's over.
No. No.

11:24.534 --> 11:26.301
It's not over, Jason.

11:26.369 --> 11:28.303
Bauer has a recording

11:28.371 --> 11:30.272
that implicates me
along with Suvarov.

11:30.340 --> 11:31.674
How do you know?

11:31.741 --> 11:34.343
Because the son of a bitch
played the damn thing for me.

11:34.411 --> 11:36.445
He must've put a bug on me
somewhere

11:36.513 --> 11:37.813
when he attacked the car.

11:37.881 --> 11:39.214
For all I know,

11:39.282 --> 11:41.684
he has recorded every
conversation I've had

11:41.751 --> 11:43.018
for the past two hours.

11:43.086 --> 11:44.720
I'm on site now.

11:44.788 --> 11:45.954
I'll recover whatever he's got.

11:46.022 --> 11:47.956
Hey!

11:48.024 --> 11:50.426
You're on the line here, too.

11:50.493 --> 11:52.461
If this evidence gets out,

11:52.529 --> 11:55.064
we all go down together.

11:55.131 --> 11:56.965
Yeah, I understand what's
at stake, Mr. President.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.834
I'll call you back when
I have the recording.

11:58.902 --> 12:00.669
Yeah.

12:00.737 --> 12:03.372
(exhales forcefully)

12:04.340 --> 12:06.175
Is he stable?

12:06.242 --> 12:08.010
Yes, sir.
Sir,

12:08.078 --> 12:09.845
as you requested,
I searched Bauer.

12:09.913 --> 12:13.582
We're still combing the site,
but that's what we found so far.

12:18.221 --> 12:19.588
PILLAR:
Are you sure that's it?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.623
BURKE: Like I said, sir,
we're still sweeping.

12:21.691 --> 12:24.059
I believe this
phone is yours.

12:24.127 --> 12:26.128
(under breath): Yeah.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.167
It's a, uh,

12:32.235 --> 12:33.402
digital recorder, sir,
but it's clean.

12:33.470 --> 12:35.437
There's nothing in it.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.740
Come here.

12:39.309 --> 12:41.243
Excuse us.

12:41.311 --> 12:44.046
The data card is missing.

12:44.114 --> 12:45.614
Bauer has a digital file

12:45.682 --> 12:47.449
that poses a threat
to national security.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.585
We need to find it.
Yes, sir. We'll keep looking.

12:56.459 --> 12:58.460
PILLAR:
What happened up here?

12:58.528 --> 13:00.295
He drew his gun
and I shot him.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.730
What more do you
need to know?

13:01.798 --> 13:03.465
Did Bauer give you anything?

13:03.533 --> 13:05.534
What would he have given me?

13:05.602 --> 13:07.035
Bauer had a digital recorder.

13:07.103 --> 13:08.070
The data card's missing.

13:08.138 --> 13:09.705
I thought you might
know where it is.

13:09.773 --> 13:11.140
I don't know what
you're talking about.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.209
You didn't see him
stash it anywhere?

13:14.277 --> 13:17.546
If I did, I would've taken it
and already logged it

13:17.614 --> 13:19.548
as evidence.

13:19.616 --> 13:21.316
Then you don't mind
emptying your pockets.

13:22.352 --> 13:23.986
Um...

13:24.053 --> 13:26.155
I just shot my friend, so...
Unless you want me

13:26.222 --> 13:28.624
to do it for you, I need you
to empty your pockets now.

13:28.691 --> 13:30.559
On what grounds?

13:30.627 --> 13:31.827
National security.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.630
Let's go.

13:34.697 --> 13:36.665
(sighs)

13:50.146 --> 13:52.581
If I search you,
will I find that data card?

13:52.649 --> 13:54.716
This is ridiculous.

13:54.784 --> 13:56.451
Put your hands up here.

14:01.858 --> 14:03.292
I just told you, I shot Jack.

14:03.359 --> 14:05.227
Why would I be helping him?

14:05.295 --> 14:08.297
Sorry, Ms. O'Brian, I have
to be absolutely sure.

14:27.984 --> 14:29.918
Okay.

14:29.986 --> 14:31.987
Hope you enjoyed yourself.

15:00.717 --> 15:03.719
(elevator bell dings)

15:11.327 --> 15:13.028
It's over, Jack.

15:13.096 --> 15:15.297
You need to talk to me;
maybe do yourself some good.

15:15.365 --> 15:17.366
Where's the data card?

15:21.037 --> 15:22.304
(sighs)
Is he stable enough

15:22.372 --> 15:23.839
to be treated at CTU
instead of the hospital?

15:23.907 --> 15:25.073
He should be.

15:25.141 --> 15:26.341
He got lucky.
It's a through and through.

15:26.409 --> 15:28.010
Through and through.

15:28.077 --> 15:29.344
Bullet didn't hit any

15:29.412 --> 15:31.113
of his organs or his
arteries. If you're going

15:31.180 --> 15:32.648
to get shot anywhere, that's
where you want it to happen.

15:32.715 --> 15:35.317
Son of a bitch!

15:35.385 --> 15:37.753
Get me mobile command.
(mumbling)

15:37.820 --> 15:39.821
What?

15:39.889 --> 15:42.024
You got something
to say to me?

15:42.091 --> 15:44.626
If you've got something to say,
you'd better say it now.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.961
Talk to me.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.629
(panting, muttering)

15:47.697 --> 15:49.598
What?

15:49.666 --> 15:50.933
(whispering)

15:51.000 --> 15:52.868
(Jack grunting,
Pillar screaming)

15:52.936 --> 15:56.038
(screaming continues)

15:56.105 --> 15:57.472
(spits)

15:57.540 --> 15:59.808
(yells)
Get him out of here!

15:59.876 --> 16:02.477
(yells)
Lock down O'Brian!

16:02.545 --> 16:03.912
(groans loudly)

16:05.048 --> 16:07.549
Arlo's ready
to receive the file.

16:07.617 --> 16:10.552
Chloe, you need to tell me
why you shot Jack.

16:10.620 --> 16:12.554
Jack said they'd suspect me
if I didn't; He said

16:12.622 --> 16:14.723
my only way out of there with
the evidence is to shoot him.

16:14.791 --> 16:16.725
Medical report said
it went clean through.

16:16.793 --> 16:19.895
That no vital organs were hit. You're
telling me you meant to miss them?

16:19.963 --> 16:22.798
How did you know
you wouldn't kill him?

16:22.865 --> 16:24.700
I didn't.

16:24.767 --> 16:25.734
It's uploading now.

16:25.802 --> 16:27.569
It shouldn't take long.

16:27.637 --> 16:29.805
Chloe...

16:29.872 --> 16:31.673
I just need a few
more seconds.

16:31.741 --> 16:32.975
What's going on?
Just got orders

16:33.042 --> 16:34.309
to lock down Chloe O'Brian.
What orders?

16:34.377 --> 16:35.711
Please step aside.
I'm not going anywhere

16:35.778 --> 16:36.778
till you tell me
what's going on.

16:36.846 --> 16:38.313
Sir, we're not going
to ask you again.

16:38.381 --> 16:39.681
Step aside.

16:40.717 --> 16:42.985
Don't- I order you- stop!

16:43.052 --> 16:44.853
I'm ordering you to stop! Don't!

16:44.921 --> 16:46.388
Ms. O'Brian, is this

16:46.456 --> 16:47.556
the data card
that Jack Bauer gave you?

16:47.623 --> 16:49.191
Yes. You need to listen
to what's on it.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.592
Mr. Pillar will make
that determination.

16:50.660 --> 16:51.927
Pillar is part of the cover-up.

16:51.995 --> 16:54.429
That data card will never
make it to evidence.

16:54.497 --> 16:55.597
Please!

16:55.665 --> 16:56.832
Hold them here.
Don't do this!

16:56.899 --> 16:57.866
Burke!

16:57.934 --> 16:59.701
Burke, stop what you're doing!

16:59.769 --> 17:01.103
Think about what you're doing!

17:01.170 --> 17:03.271
Burke, stop!

17:04.906 --> 17:07.108
(phone rings)

17:07.175 --> 17:09.144
Pillar.
BURKE: Mr. Pillar,

17:09.212 --> 17:10.811
I locked down O'Brian.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.481
Looks like she was working
with Agent Ortiz.

17:12.548 --> 17:13.815
He's in custody, too.

17:13.883 --> 17:15.250
Get the data card?

17:15.318 --> 17:16.451
Yes, sir.

17:16.519 --> 17:17.719
O'Brian was trying
to upload the file

17:17.787 --> 17:18.753
to the main
servers at CTU,

17:18.820 --> 17:20.756
but I stopped
the transmission.

17:20.823 --> 17:22.656
Good work, Agent Burke.

17:22.724 --> 17:25.426
All right, send O'Brian
and Ortiz to CTU lockdown

17:25.494 --> 17:26.762
and talk to no one.

17:26.829 --> 17:28.764
Get that data card
to President Logan.

17:28.831 --> 17:30.499
Yes, sir.

17:30.566 --> 17:32.134
Take them to CTU.

17:50.294 --> 17:51.995
This is it.

17:52.063 --> 17:53.997
(sighs)

17:54.065 --> 17:57.834
This is the recording
that Jack Bauer made.

17:57.902 --> 17:59.336
Bauer was working

17:59.403 --> 18:03.039
with Chloe O'Brian and a field
agent called Cole Ortiz.

18:03.107 --> 18:05.041
They were planning
to use CTU's servers

18:05.109 --> 18:07.077
to disseminate this recording

18:07.145 --> 18:10.080
to news organizations,
and-and government officials

18:10.148 --> 18:13.083
and watchdog groups
on a massive scale.

18:13.151 --> 18:15.085
It almost worked.

18:15.153 --> 18:17.821
My people, they never gave up,
and now it's over.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.890
You won.

18:21.159 --> 18:23.493
Congratulations.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.529
Have you listened to this?

18:25.596 --> 18:28.231
Yes, yes, but frankly,
it's not worth hearing.

18:29.267 --> 18:31.968
Where is Jack now?

18:32.036 --> 18:35.705
He's about to be transported
to CTU under heavy guard.

18:36.974 --> 18:40.277
I realize that this
is a difficult area,

18:40.344 --> 18:42.546
but the one thing
we can be certain of

18:42.613 --> 18:45.148
is that Jack Bauer will never

18:45.216 --> 18:47.117
let this go.

18:47.185 --> 18:49.286
No.

18:49.353 --> 18:51.388
I don't suppose he will.

18:53.391 --> 18:56.393
All great achievements
in state...

18:56.460 --> 18:58.428
are fragile things,

18:58.496 --> 19:01.431
Madam President.

19:01.499 --> 19:03.967
Especially
in their infancy.

19:04.035 --> 19:07.003
They need
to be protected.

19:07.071 --> 19:10.006
Our peace agreement-
very vulnerable.

19:10.074 --> 19:12.008
As long as Jack Bauer
is out there,

19:12.076 --> 19:14.711
the agreement will
never be safe.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.713
Then we will lock him away

19:16.781 --> 19:19.749
in a black site halfway
around the world.

19:19.817 --> 19:22.752
He will find a way,
Madam President.

19:22.820 --> 19:24.654
Mark my words.

19:24.722 --> 19:28.391
He will rise out of the
deepest hole in the ground.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.428
He will claw
his way back

19:31.495 --> 19:33.463
from the ends
of the Earth,

19:33.531 --> 19:37.033
unless we stop him
before that can happen.

19:43.674 --> 19:46.142
Pending approval,
I have taken upon myself

19:46.210 --> 19:50.113
to, uh... put a plan in motion.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.150
Of course you have.

19:58.723 --> 20:01.157
I will take your silence

20:01.225 --> 20:03.159
as tacit approval.

20:07.965 --> 20:09.900
(door opens)

20:09.967 --> 20:12.569
(Taylor exhales sharply,
door closes)

20:14.472 --> 20:17.340
(sighs heavily)

20:25.049 --> 20:27.083
(sniffles)

20:28.419 --> 20:29.853
(inserts data card
into laptop port)

20:29.921 --> 20:32.222
A lot of good people
died today,

20:32.290 --> 20:33.623
not just President Hassan.

20:33.691 --> 20:38.328
Operatives from CTU, members of
other law enforcement agencies.

20:41.799 --> 20:43.800
Renee Walker.

20:45.836 --> 20:48.138
Who I was
very close to.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.742
These people died today
because President Suvarov

20:52.810 --> 20:55.812
wanted to destroy the peace
treaty for his own interests,

20:55.880 --> 20:57.981
and President Taylor knows
this because I told her,

20:58.049 --> 21:00.050
but she's willing to cover
it up because she believes

21:00.117 --> 21:01.818
the peace accord will serve the
greater good. (phone ringing)

21:01.886 --> 21:04.120
She is wrong; it
won't. (sniffles)

21:06.691 --> 21:08.625
Yes.

21:08.693 --> 21:10.260
Both delegations are here,
ma'am.

21:11.462 --> 21:13.797
What about
the secretary general?

21:13.864 --> 21:15.899
He's just outside
in the atrium.

21:15.967 --> 21:18.301
Thank you, Tim.

21:20.338 --> 21:22.605
(hangs up phone)

21:22.673 --> 21:23.974
(taps computer key)

21:24.041 --> 21:25.375
(sighs)

21:27.578 --> 21:31.648
Lasting peace
cannot simply be political.

21:31.716 --> 21:35.118
It has to be born out of trust
and honesty and understanding

21:35.186 --> 21:39.122
and most importantly, a will
on both sides to move forward.

21:41.492 --> 21:43.426
Currently,
that will does not exist.

21:43.494 --> 21:45.362
This peace is fraudulent,
and I cannot

21:45.429 --> 21:47.097
in good conscience
allow the people

21:47.164 --> 21:50.200
that lost their lives today
to go unspoken for.

21:50.267 --> 21:54.104
Kim, you reminded me
of that earlier today.

21:54.171 --> 21:56.473
That's who I am.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.644
(Taylor sniffs)

22:11.055 --> 22:13.690
(sighs)

22:17.294 --> 22:19.429
Bauer is
being handled.

22:19.497 --> 22:20.497
Is it done?
Yes, sir.

22:20.564 --> 22:23.433
All right, then.

22:23.501 --> 22:25.035
(both sigh)
(pats back)

22:26.070 --> 22:28.905
You know, I wasn't sure

22:28.973 --> 22:31.608
the president had the balls
to see this through.

22:31.675 --> 22:32.609
Clearly,

22:32.676 --> 22:33.610
I underestimated her.

22:33.677 --> 22:35.545
We both did, sir.

22:35.613 --> 22:37.614
(door opens)

22:41.552 --> 22:43.853
Good luck,
Madam President.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.845
This calls

23:08.913 --> 23:10.180
for a celebration.

23:10.247 --> 23:12.115
Huh, a little something
to numb that ear pain?

23:12.183 --> 23:13.616
(chuckles)

23:13.684 --> 23:15.218
What are you
drinking?

23:15.286 --> 23:16.920
Whatever you're having,
Mr. President. Yes.

23:18.756 --> 23:20.123
(pouring)

23:20.191 --> 23:22.959
You did well, Jason.

23:24.228 --> 23:28.531
You kept your eye
on the prize.

23:28.599 --> 23:29.866
Thank you, sir.

23:29.934 --> 23:33.503
Here's to, uh, all
the political capital

23:33.571 --> 23:35.738
the president is
about to bank

23:35.806 --> 23:37.640
downstairs.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.142
And here's
to helping her spend it.

23:41.812 --> 23:44.314
(quiet chatter)

23:51.322 --> 23:54.090
(whispering): I keep having to remind
myself that we will be home tomorrow,

23:54.158 --> 23:55.425
and this day

23:55.493 --> 23:56.793
will be behind us.

23:56.861 --> 23:59.362
(applause)

24:21.685 --> 24:24.287
SECRETARY GENERAL: Ladies
and gentlemen, please, please,

24:24.355 --> 24:27.223
please take your seats.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.094
Honored delegates

24:31.162 --> 24:34.063
and distinguished guests,

24:34.131 --> 24:35.398
on behalf of the United Nations,

24:35.466 --> 24:36.799
please allow me
to welcome you

24:36.867 --> 24:41.171
to this great occasion
of hope and peace.

24:41.238 --> 24:45.175
Today we bear witness
to an extraordinary act

24:45.242 --> 24:46.910
in one of the world's
defining dramas.

24:46.977 --> 24:48.311
If you would

24:48.379 --> 24:51.614
allow me now just to offer a few
private words to those of us

24:51.682 --> 24:55.118
that are fortunate enough
to be here now.

24:55.186 --> 24:56.519
May we all pledge

24:56.587 --> 25:01.658
to make the spirit
of this moment...

25:01.725 --> 25:04.127
a new chapter in the history

25:04.195 --> 25:07.797
of all nations.

25:07.865 --> 25:10.099
The President
of the United States of America,

25:10.167 --> 25:12.769
please, would you join me?

25:14.171 --> 25:17.674
The President
of the Russian Federation

25:17.741 --> 25:21.044
and the President of the
Islamic Republic of Kamistan,

25:21.111 --> 25:23.846
would you please join me?

25:37.027 --> 25:40.296
Before you is the final draft

25:40.364 --> 25:42.432
of the agreement
that has been negotiated

25:42.499 --> 25:45.835
by you and your representatives
in good faith.

25:45.903 --> 25:47.770
By signing its pages, you commit

25:47.838 --> 25:51.007
your respective countries
to abide by the terms

25:51.075 --> 25:55.912
set forth therein, as stipulated
by international law.

25:57.948 --> 26:02.719
President Suvarov, I believe
you are to go first.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.863
(applause)

26:22.172 --> 26:24.474
SECRETARY GENERAL:
President Hassan.

26:48.432 --> 26:51.534
(applause)

27:18.529 --> 27:21.564
âª âª

27:32.242 --> 27:34.243
(sniffs)

28:01.372 --> 28:04.407
âª âª

28:17.321 --> 28:21.691
Your husband wanted
me to have this.

28:21.759 --> 28:24.394
I cannot accept it.

28:27.197 --> 28:29.465
Madam President,
what are you doing?

28:29.533 --> 28:31.200
What I should have
done hours ago.

28:31.268 --> 28:35.671
I urge you to stop
what you are about to do.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.242
Mr. Secretary General,

28:39.309 --> 28:42.111
my fellow delegates.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.214
Grave crimes have been committed

28:45.282 --> 28:47.283
in the run-up to this treaty.

28:49.353 --> 28:51.087
I have participated

28:51.155 --> 28:52.588
in a conspiracy

28:52.656 --> 28:55.925
to hide those crimes.

28:57.327 --> 29:00.830
Before there can be
a meaningful peace,

29:00.898 --> 29:03.232
justice must be served.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.801
(sniffles)

29:06.570 --> 29:08.504
I will be

29:08.572 --> 29:11.941
giving a more complete statement
within the hour,

29:12.009 --> 29:14.210
but for now,

29:14.278 --> 29:17.146
this peace process has come
to an end.

29:18.282 --> 29:20.883
(delegates murmuring)

29:32.095 --> 29:34.096
Contact CTU and
have them alert

29:34.164 --> 29:35.932
Jack Bauer's
medical transport.

29:35.999 --> 29:37.099
Madam President...

29:37.167 --> 29:39.135
He is about to
be ambushed.

29:39.203 --> 29:40.636
Just make the call, Tim!

29:40.704 --> 29:42.738
We may already
be too late.

29:48.111 --> 29:49.078
Dispatch, this is Tim Woods.

29:49.146 --> 29:50.379
I have an emergency.

29:50.447 --> 29:53.249
The convoy transporting Jack
Bauer is about to be ambushed.

29:53.317 --> 29:55.952
Alert Medical One
immediately.

29:56.019 --> 29:58.421
W- do it.

30:00.424 --> 30:01.424
(shuddering)

30:01.492 --> 30:03.993
Madam President,
talk to me.

30:04.061 --> 30:07.864
Tell me
what's happening.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.500
Ma'am.

30:10.567 --> 30:13.135
I have made
a terrible mistake, Tim,

30:13.203 --> 30:15.071
one that I can

30:15.138 --> 30:19.509
never undo... but I need you
to help me stop it

30:19.576 --> 30:21.511
from becoming worse.

30:21.578 --> 30:23.579
Yes, ma'am.

30:28.218 --> 30:29.519
(coughing)

30:29.586 --> 30:31.654
DISPATCHER (over radio): Medical
One, this is CTU Dispatch.

30:31.722 --> 30:33.089
(coughing)

30:33.156 --> 30:36.425
Medical One, I have a priority
call from Homeland Security.

30:36.493 --> 30:38.895
Come in, please.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.029
(Jack groans)

30:40.097 --> 30:41.931
(panting)

30:43.066 --> 30:45.968
(phone rings)

30:46.036 --> 30:48.037
This is Woods.

30:52.142 --> 30:54.143
Thank you.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.915
We didn't make it.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.750
They got Bauer.

31:00.817 --> 31:03.352
(groans loudly)

31:08.959 --> 31:11.928
My statement is brief,
and I will take no questions.

31:13.096 --> 31:15.097
Moments ago,

31:15.165 --> 31:16.966
President Taylor
declined to sign

31:17.034 --> 31:20.136
the peace accord and excused
herself from the proceedings.

31:20.203 --> 31:21.504
She did so after making

31:21.572 --> 31:24.373
allegations of crimes
which she did not specify,

31:24.441 --> 31:27.176
and which the United Nations
has no knowledge of.

31:28.745 --> 31:30.279
President Taylor said
that she would come forward

31:30.347 --> 31:34.684
within the hour to explain
the reasons for her actions.

31:34.751 --> 31:38.354
Until then, please,
direct all queries

31:38.422 --> 31:40.156
to the White House
Communications Office.

31:40.223 --> 31:43.125
(phone ringing,
press corps clamoring)

31:43.193 --> 31:45.361
TV REPORTER: President
Taylor herself, after...

31:45.429 --> 31:47.396
(TV turns off)

31:47.464 --> 31:49.198
(phone ringing)

31:49.266 --> 31:52.234
That's the President
asking about Bauer.

31:53.937 --> 31:55.938
(ringing continues)

31:56.974 --> 31:58.107
No.

32:01.445 --> 32:03.045
Let it ring.

32:03.113 --> 32:06.515
With due respect, sir,
what good will it do?

32:06.583 --> 32:07.817
(ringing continues)

32:07.884 --> 32:10.119
It's over.

32:10.187 --> 32:13.522
Let's not add murder to the list
of charges already against us.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.591
(ringing continues)

32:23.734 --> 32:25.334
You know what, Jason?
You're right.

32:27.104 --> 32:29.372
Go ahead. Pick it up.

32:29.439 --> 32:31.407
(ringing continues)

32:31.475 --> 32:33.009
(Pillar clears throat)

32:33.076 --> 32:34.243
PILLAR:
Hello?

32:34.311 --> 32:35.411
This is President Taylor.

32:35.479 --> 32:37.146
I need to speak
to Charles Logan immediately.

32:37.214 --> 32:38.247
(blow lands)

32:38.315 --> 32:40.316
(groans)
Charles!

32:45.589 --> 32:47.857
This was my last chance,

32:47.924 --> 32:49.925
and Bauer took it away.

32:57.467 --> 32:59.669
It's come to this
because of him.

32:59.736 --> 33:01.737
(silenced shot)

33:06.810 --> 33:08.310
It's locked.

33:10.047 --> 33:11.881
(banging)
Open

33:11.948 --> 33:13.916
the door, Charles!
This is Tim Woods.

33:13.984 --> 33:15.484
I'm with the President
on the 22nd floor.

33:15.552 --> 33:17.820
We need the master key
to room 2206 immediately.

33:17.888 --> 33:19.321
(banging resumes)

33:19.389 --> 33:21.557
TAYLOR: Damn it,
Charles! Open the door!

33:27.898 --> 33:28.998
(gunshot)

33:29.066 --> 33:30.599
Madam President,
this way! Now!

33:30.667 --> 33:33.536
Tim, I need Logan alive!

33:50.603 --> 33:52.537
Can they save him?

33:52.605 --> 33:54.372
They think so,
but Madam President,

33:54.440 --> 33:56.141
they're saying that even if
he regains consciousness,

33:56.209 --> 33:58.477
he's probably suffered
severe brain damage.

33:58.544 --> 34:00.746
He knew he was
the only one who could

34:00.813 --> 34:03.648
locate Jack.
Not necessarily.

34:03.716 --> 34:06.318
CTU's drones have been in the
air for the last four hours.

34:06.385 --> 34:08.820
They may be able to back-trace
Jack from the ambush site

34:08.888 --> 34:10.255
using archived
surveillance video.

34:10.322 --> 34:11.422
Where is Chloe O'Brian?

34:11.491 --> 34:12.791
She and Agent Ortiz

34:12.859 --> 34:14.259
returned to CTU
about ten minutes ago,

34:14.327 --> 34:16.995
under arrest. I want
them released immediately.

34:17.063 --> 34:18.330
Tell Chloe to use

34:18.397 --> 34:20.665
whatever resources are at her
disposal to find Jack.

34:20.733 --> 34:23.101
I've already done that,
Madam President.

34:23.168 --> 34:25.170
Thank you, Tim.

34:26.906 --> 34:28.106
Thank you.

34:33.545 --> 34:34.612
EDEN:
Let go of me!

34:34.679 --> 34:36.414
O'Brian, you have no authority.

34:36.482 --> 34:37.681
I don't know what you
think you're doing.

34:37.750 --> 34:39.317
Shut up and keep moving.
What the hell

34:39.385 --> 34:41.286
is going on?

34:41.353 --> 34:42.920
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

34:42.989 --> 34:44.322
President Taylor
didn't sign the agreement.

34:44.389 --> 34:46.091
She backed out at the last
minute, but she had already

34:46.159 --> 34:47.958
ordered the hit on Jack.
Did she call it off?

34:48.027 --> 34:49.494
She tried, but his
ambulance has

34:49.562 --> 34:51.696
been ambushed. She has no
way of contacting the hitters.

34:51.764 --> 34:53.764
How does she even know Jack's
still alive? She doesn't.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.199
She's had everyone
cleared from the floor

34:55.268 --> 34:56.935
except for you, me and Arlo.

34:57.003 --> 34:58.870
Arlo's redirecting the drone
to over the ambush site.

34:58.938 --> 35:01.773
We just got police reports
of an incident downtown.

35:01.841 --> 35:03.275
CTU convoy ambushed,

35:03.342 --> 35:04.943
three agents wounded,
but they didn't find

35:05.011 --> 35:07.179
Jack's body on site. Can
you pull up archived video

35:07.246 --> 35:09.881
of the same location?
Already on it.

35:14.720 --> 35:16.321
COLE:
When did this happen?

35:16.389 --> 35:18.056
ARLO:
Five minutes ago.

35:19.292 --> 35:20.625
Shuttle forward.

35:24.397 --> 35:25.831
Come on, Arlo.
Give me something.

35:25.898 --> 35:27.065
Okay, 30 seconds ago,

35:27.133 --> 35:29.334
the van pulled off of Delancey.

35:29.402 --> 35:30.502
Damn it.
What?

35:30.570 --> 35:31.636
Lost it under
the Williamsburg Bridge.

35:31.704 --> 35:34.039
Go to real time.

35:38.077 --> 35:40.111
âª âª

35:44.383 --> 35:46.484
ARLO:
That's it. That's the van.

35:46.552 --> 35:48.253
Have NYPD send all units
to the vicinity.

35:48.321 --> 35:49.321
They're never going

35:49.388 --> 35:51.556
to make it in time.

35:51.624 --> 35:53.592
Um...

35:56.128 --> 35:59.064
Okay, uh, hold on.

36:01.968 --> 36:04.402
Prepare for departure run-through
with Team B in 20 minutes.

36:04.470 --> 36:05.737
I got this!

36:05.805 --> 36:07.205
Come on.

36:07.273 --> 36:08.573
Turn around.
Turn around.

36:08.641 --> 36:11.276
Down on your knees.

36:11.344 --> 36:15.247
(panting and groaning quietly)

36:15.314 --> 36:17.215
I know who you are.

36:17.283 --> 36:19.684
So I'm going to make this,

36:19.752 --> 36:21.419
uh, quick and clean.

36:23.656 --> 36:25.657
Am I supposed to say thank you?

36:30.930 --> 36:32.297
(grunting)

36:37.103 --> 36:39.938
Stand down! Stand down!

37:02.628 --> 37:05.630
I really don't want to do this,
but orders are orders.

37:05.698 --> 37:08.166
It's all right.

37:10.336 --> 37:12.370
Pull the trigger.

37:13.072 --> 37:15.640
Sir!

37:15.708 --> 37:16.942
Wait! Hold your fire!

37:22.815 --> 37:24.582
It's President Taylor.

37:24.650 --> 37:25.884
I don't have positive
confirmation,

37:25.952 --> 37:27.118
but it sounds like her.

37:27.186 --> 37:28.420
She says CTU
has a drone overhead.

37:28.487 --> 37:30.989
They're got a directed
microwave signal.

37:31.057 --> 37:33.658
That's how they got
through to the phone.

37:42.001 --> 37:43.201
Madam President?

37:43.269 --> 37:45.704
I am ordering you
to release Jack Bauer

37:45.771 --> 37:47.872
immediately!
Ma'am?

37:47.940 --> 37:49.107
You heard me!

37:49.175 --> 37:52.877
You and your men are
to leave Mr. Bauer where he is.

37:52.945 --> 37:56.047
Stand down and withdraw
outside the west gate

37:56.115 --> 37:58.149
until the FBI arrives.

37:58.217 --> 38:01.186
If you have any thoughts
of fleeing before then,

38:01.253 --> 38:03.788
the drone is equipped
with two AGM-114

38:03.856 --> 38:06.491
Hellfire missiles. I will
not hesitate to use them.

38:06.559 --> 38:08.460
Are we clear?
Yes, ma'am.

38:08.527 --> 38:10.595
Now, put Mr. Bauer on the phone.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.401
Uncuff him.

38:16.469 --> 38:18.937
Sir?
I said, "Uncuff him."

38:22.508 --> 38:24.476
(handcuffs unlocking)

38:24.543 --> 38:26.544
(panting)

38:31.250 --> 38:32.684
You're ordered
to stand down and evacuate.

38:32.752 --> 38:34.886
We're rolling up
and evacuating.

38:34.954 --> 38:36.888
Let's get in the van.

38:36.956 --> 38:39.557
Let's move. Now.

38:41.260 --> 38:42.694
The President wants
to talk to you.

38:55.574 --> 38:58.710
TAYLOR (over phone):
Jack?

38:58.778 --> 39:00.545
You should've
let them kill me...

39:02.081 --> 39:05.550
...'cause I'm not going
to quit until this is over.

39:05.618 --> 39:07.252
It is over.

39:09.155 --> 39:12.057
I withdrew 15 minutes ago from
the signing of the peace treaty.

39:12.124 --> 39:15.927
Within the hour,
I will tell the world

39:15.995 --> 39:17.729
what happened today.

39:17.797 --> 39:20.231
I will tender
my resignation

39:20.299 --> 39:23.068
and remand myself
to the attorney general...

39:23.135 --> 39:25.537
and face the consequences
of my actions.

39:27.339 --> 39:29.841
Unfortunately, you will
have to do the same.

39:32.511 --> 39:35.213
I wanted this peace
so badly, Jack.

39:35.281 --> 39:37.882
And for that, I have betrayed

39:37.950 --> 39:40.652
every principle
that I have ever stood for.

39:42.688 --> 39:44.689
And I betrayed you.

39:46.525 --> 39:48.526
If I had listened to you,

39:48.594 --> 39:50.261
none of this
would have happened.

39:51.897 --> 39:55.266
We've both made mistakes we're
going to have to live with.

39:55.334 --> 39:58.336
I would give anything
to take back the time.

39:59.872 --> 40:01.806
But all I can do is tell you

40:01.874 --> 40:04.175
to leave the country
while you still have a chance.

40:05.511 --> 40:08.580
The Russians will
be coming after you.

40:08.647 --> 40:10.381
And so will we.

40:13.486 --> 40:15.653
Jack, I am so sorry.

40:19.992 --> 40:22.794
I don't know what else to say.

40:40.846 --> 40:42.881
âª âª

40:51.223 --> 40:54.092
(phone ringing)

40:54.160 --> 40:55.827
Jack?

40:55.895 --> 40:57.295
Chloe, the president just told
me what was happening.

40:57.363 --> 40:58.963
She said she was going
to give me a little time

40:59.031 --> 41:00.165
to try and get
out of the country.

41:00.232 --> 41:02.200
I know. I was on the call.
My daughter...

41:02.268 --> 41:04.969
her family- they're going
to try and use her to get to me.

41:05.037 --> 41:06.171
I'll make sure
they're protected.

41:06.238 --> 41:08.840
No. Chloe, you've got
to promise me.

41:08.908 --> 41:10.341
You've got to promise me
you'll keep them safe.

41:10.409 --> 41:12.343
I'll make sure they're
protected. I promise.

41:12.411 --> 41:15.013
How much time
do you think I've got?

41:15.080 --> 41:16.648
I don't know.

41:16.715 --> 41:18.583
I'll get you as much time
as I can.

41:19.919 --> 41:21.452
Chloe...

41:22.488 --> 41:24.923
What?

41:29.929 --> 41:31.429
When you first came to CTU...

41:36.869 --> 41:38.803
I never thought
it was going to be you

41:38.871 --> 41:41.873
that was going to cover
my back all those years.

41:41.941 --> 41:44.209
And I know that everything
that you did today

41:44.276 --> 41:46.778
was to try and protect
me. I know that.

41:52.918 --> 41:54.085
Thank you.

41:59.158 --> 42:00.925
Good luck, Jack.

42:02.394 --> 42:04.395
Yeah...

42:19.812 --> 42:22.313
Bring the drone
back to the base.

42:22.381 --> 42:24.315
Whatever happened here
didn't happen.

42:24.383 --> 42:26.384
Understand?

42:46.438 --> 42:48.373
Shut it down.
