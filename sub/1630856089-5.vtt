15:19.720 --> 15:22.760
because, unlike Diana,
Will is a shy old thing,

15:23.520 --> 15:25.760
not comfortable
with that kind of attention.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.080
<i>Well, who would be?</i>

15:27.080 --> 15:28.880
So he needs your support.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.360
<i>I'm trying, but... he doesn't make it easy.</i>

15:32.880 --> 15:36.360
<i>He's so monosyllabic these days,
he's almost hostile.</i>

15:36.360 --> 15:38.480
This isn't about
what you're getting from him.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.440
<i>And it's not as if I was given
the best example to follow.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:44.480
<i>The Duke of Edinburgh was hardly
the most communicative or...</i>

15:45.000 --> 15:46.880
<i>affectionate father to me.</i>

15:46.880 --> 15:50.400
<i>Hardly surprising given the delinquency
of his own father's parenting.</i>

15:50.400 --> 15:54.360
I'm afraid we don't do fathers and sons
very well in this family.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.400
<i>And you know my attitude to that.</i>

15:58.920 --> 15:59.880
It's no excuse.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.160
<i>It really isn't.</i>

16:01.760 --> 16:04.000
The boys need you now more than ever.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.440
And if I may...

16:05.440 --> 16:06.640
<i>Go on.</i>

16:06.640 --> 16:08.240
You need them too.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.320
<i>What kind of man
can look himself in the eye</i>

16:13.320 --> 16:15.960
<i>if he is a father
and know that he's failed at that?</i>

16:20.800 --> 16:22.800
[distorted, muffled soundscape]

16:36.840 --> 16:37.720
[knock at door]

16:39.200 --> 16:40.040
A quick word?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.120
[indistinct background chatter]

16:44.320 --> 16:45.360
[door shuts]

16:48.400 --> 16:50.560
Someone from
the Prince of Wales's office called

16:50.560 --> 16:52.640
asking if your father
might come and see you.

16:54.400 --> 16:55.240
Here?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.680
I said you could use my office.

16:59.040 --> 17:00.520
[exhales slowly]

17:09.120 --> 17:10.080
Valentine's Day.

17:13.000 --> 17:13.840
Yeah.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.920
Would you, um...

17:19.600 --> 17:21.440
would you like me to dispose of them?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.240
Thank you.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.880
There's always next year.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.480
[bag rustling]

17:34.080 --> 17:35.280
[door opens]

17:37.440 --> 17:38.360
[door shuts]

17:38.920 --> 17:40.920
[rain pattering]

17:42.240 --> 17:43.080
Sir.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.840
[Charles] <i>I hope I'm not
dragging you away from anything.</i>

18:00.400 --> 18:01.600
Just wanted to see

18:02.600 --> 18:03.600
how you were.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.280
Fine.

18:09.880 --> 18:10.880
And school?

18:12.760 --> 18:13.760
Fine.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
Friends?

18:16.800 --> 18:17.680
Fine.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.600
Oh, I heard you, um, broke
you the school record

18:22.600 --> 18:25.040
in, um, swimming the... 50 meters.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.360
The junior record.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.440
Well done.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.640
Oh, I spoke with Harry yesterday, and, um...

18:42.120 --> 18:44.960
I suggested to him
that it might be nice for us all to

18:45.800 --> 18:47.080
visit Mummy's grave.

18:49.680 --> 18:50.840
Place some flowers.

18:53.480 --> 18:54.800
[rain pattering]

18:54.800 --> 18:56.880
[thunder rumbling]

19:05.800 --> 19:07.800
Maybe it's... maybe it's too soon.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.960
[thunder rumbling]

19:18.320 --> 19:19.880
Oh, there was something else.

19:20.920 --> 19:26.120
I'd like both of you to join me
in a visit to Canada over Easter.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.640
The idea is to combine
a few official engagements

19:30.640 --> 19:33.920
with a four-day skiing holiday
in Whistler.

19:35.160 --> 19:39.000
- Just the three of us.
- I had plans to see friends.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.720
I think it'll be... it'll be good for us.

19:46.760 --> 19:47.880
As a family.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.400
And for you.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.520
And... and Harry.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.800
It was agony.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.360
- [Camilla] <i>At least you made the effort.</i>
- Yes, and he pushed it back in my face.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.960
<i>Well, that is his right.</i>

20:02.920 --> 20:05.160
Imagine if I'd ever
spoken to my father like that.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.840
<i>Different generation.</i>

20:06.840 --> 20:08.680
Honestly, I'm black and blue.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.760
<i>Well, it's all part of the job
of being a father,</i>

20:11.760 --> 20:15.640
which, I believe, is probably
the most important job you'll ever have.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.600
I know.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.000
No, you don't know.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.280
You think you know.
But it's obvious you really don't know.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.000
I'll know when you know, and let you know.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.600
[chuckles]

20:26.600 --> 20:27.520
Right!

20:28.720 --> 20:29.560
[chuckles]

20:30.280 --> 20:31.920
Oh God, I miss you.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.960
When can I see you?

20:35.760 --> 20:36.760
<i>Not yet.</i>

20:37.440 --> 20:38.720
- Yeah.
<i>- Too soon.</i>

20:38.720 --> 20:39.800
Yes.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.520
The prison of public opinion.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.840
How are you in all this? You all right?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.040
<i>I'm the last person
you should worry about.</i>

20:50.920 --> 20:52.280
You've been so patient.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.960
So gallant.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.240
[sniffles] How you've suffered
throughout all this, my poor darling.

20:58.240 --> 20:59.680
Boohoo, poor me.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.280
These are exceptional circumstances.

21:03.280 --> 21:04.360
<i>Mmm.</i>

21:06.080 --> 21:07.080
I'm fine.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.840
<i>Speak tomorrow.</i>

21:12.280 --> 21:13.160
[phone beeps off]

21:15.520 --> 21:17.520
[exhales shakily]

21:24.200 --> 21:25.920
[Charles] So, okay, well, that looks good.

21:25.920 --> 21:28.680
[Bolland] Yeah, you can see
in the documents, the itineraries

21:28.680 --> 21:34.000
that there's a... there's a few
moments of, uh... of rest for you.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.440
[Charles] Who's the Italian man?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.160
- [Bolland] Massimo Bueno.
- Open wide.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.240
[Bolland] We met him
at Highgrove that time...

21:41.240 --> 21:42.160
Go on.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.400
- [quietly] Oh!
- [Charles] He's rather good, isn't he?

21:46.400 --> 21:50.240
[Bolland] I think he's very switched-on,
and apparently, they're planning...

21:52.080 --> 21:56.280
a scheme to... to, uh, give placement...

21:56.280 --> 21:58.200
[William and Harry chuckling softly]

21:58.200 --> 21:59.200
...abroad...

22:01.880 --> 22:04.760
to, um, disadvantaged young people.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.240
They want the Prince's Trust
to be the lead partner.

22:07.240 --> 22:09.120
- Well, that's encouraging.
- Yeah.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.200
Which, um...

22:12.120 --> 22:15.160
which, um...
countries were they thinking of?

22:15.760 --> 22:19.320
[Bolland] It's a joint initiative
with Italy and Sweden, so I presume now...

22:19.840 --> 22:21.320
- [William] Oh!
- [laughing]

22:21.320 --> 22:23.400
- [sirens blaring]
- [crowd cheering]

22:34.880 --> 22:36.880
[girls screaming]

22:47.600 --> 22:50.320
- Nice to see you, Your Royal Highness.
- Thank you very much.

22:50.840 --> 22:52.880
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you so much.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.320
- Welcome.
- Thank you very much.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.520
- What's all this?
- Sorry, I had no idea.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.320
- Did you know about this?
- No, sir.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.600
[newsman] <i>Charles, Prince of Wales,
and his sons, Princes William and Harry,</i>

23:04.600 --> 23:08.360
<i>arrived in Vancouver tonight
for a six-day visit to British Columbia.</i>

23:08.360 --> 23:10.560
<i>The three princes
will make public appearances</i>

23:10.560 --> 23:12.000
<i>during the next two days</i>

23:12.000 --> 23:15.080
<i>before retreating to Whistler

23:15.080 --> 23:17.160
<i>CTV's Colin Gray reports.</i>

23:17.160 --> 23:18.840
G and T or whiskey?

23:19.840 --> 23:20.800
Beer's fine.

23:21.320 --> 23:24.840
- [host] <i>Help me welcome our players today...</i>
- [audience cheering]

23:24.840 --> 23:26.200
<i>- How you doing?</i>
- [woman] <i>Hello.</i>

23:26.200 --> 23:27.840
- [host] <i>Nice to see you.</i>
- [woman] <i>Hello.</i>

23:28.560 --> 23:30.840
[host] <i>Wendy Goodson, born in, uh, Peru.</i>

23:31.480 --> 23:35.400
<i>And part of the air force for five years.
In what capacity?</i>

23:35.400 --> 23:37.880
- [woman] <i>Air force. Shipping cargo.</i>
- [host] <i>Yeah.</i>

23:38.600 --> 23:40.600
<i>And you served Desert Storm
as part of that.</i>

23:40.600 --> 23:44.920
<i>Welcome to the show. Playing with you here
is Matt Sutherland, just got married...</i>

23:44.920 --> 23:46.040
To Mummy.

23:46.040 --> 23:48.400
[game show continues on TV indistinctly]

23:51.520 --> 23:52.920
- To Mummy.
- [glasses clink]

24:01.920 --> 24:04.760
You know he's lined up
some official visits for us tomorrow?

24:04.760 --> 24:06.440
- [William] Who?
- Pa.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.400
[William] Oh yeah, I heard.
A school for the deaf in the morning.

24:10.920 --> 24:14.160
And a tour of some...
space center in the afternoon.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.520
[Harry] He assured me
they'd be shutting the place down.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.360
To keep the girls out.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.960
"Marry me, William! I love you!"

24:22.960 --> 24:24.760
- Fuck off.
- [both chuckle]

24:26.400 --> 24:27.640
I'm just jealous.

24:29.800 --> 24:33.760
In the history of humankind, no one has
ever screamed for someone with red hair.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.280
[audience clapping and cheering on TV]

24:39.360 --> 24:42.400
[man on TV segment]
<i>There's a new teenage heartthrob in town.</i>

24:42.400 --> 24:46.000
<i>Tall, blond, and blessed
with his mother's good looks,</i>

24:46.000 --> 24:48.760
<i>Prince William is officially a sensation.</i>

24:49.400 --> 24:52.040
<i>The world is gripped by Willsmania.</i>

24:52.040 --> 24:54.200
<i>With his blushes and demure smile,</i>

24:54.200 --> 24:57.800
<i>the young prince sometimes
seemed embarrassed by the limelight.</i>

24:57.800 --> 25:00.800
<i>But for the many girls
who mobbed him and chanted his name,</i>

25:00.800 --> 25:03.120
<i>this only added to his appeal.</i>

25:03.120 --> 25:06.000
- He's the one and only Prince Charming!
- I love him.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.280
And he said hi, and then he shook my hand.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.480
I shook his hand!

25:09.480 --> 25:11.400
[shouting excitedly]

25:11.400 --> 25:12.680
[somber music playing]

25:12.680 --> 25:17.200
[space center voice-over] The moon itself
is kept in orbit by forces of gravity,

25:17.200 --> 25:21.520
which means it is
inextricably connected to the earth.

25:21.520 --> 25:25.040
But... one mustn't
take this relationship for granted

25:25.040 --> 25:26.840
because the moon does, in fact,

25:26.840 --> 25:30.160
seem to have
a slow-burning will of its own...

25:30.160 --> 25:32.880
[muffled soundscape]

25:41.880 --> 25:43.880
[somber music continues]

26:05.280 --> 26:07.280
[muffled shouting]

26:15.640 --> 26:17.640
[muffled shouting fades out]

26:27.440 --> 26:31.840
[Charles] I thought we'd start on
a gentle run called Mathew's Traverse,

26:32.360 --> 26:35.960
and then either we come down the Saddle
here, which is a little trickier,

26:36.480 --> 26:41.280
or, if we really fancy our chances,
there's the Couloir Extreme,

26:42.160 --> 26:46.840
billed as "two and a half thousand feet
of thigh-burning hell."

26:46.840 --> 26:47.960
Yes!

26:47.960 --> 26:49.160
[Charles chuckles]

26:49.160 --> 26:50.480
[Charles] Couloir it is.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.280
Now, I've told everyone
that for the next few days,

26:53.280 --> 26:54.480
no more interruptions.

26:54.480 --> 26:58.120
It's to be the three of us
on our own, family holiday.

26:58.840 --> 26:59.680
Um...

27:00.400 --> 27:02.640
There's just one... brief thing

27:02.640 --> 27:05.320
that we... need to get out of the way first.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.400
A photo-call
with a small group of invited journalists.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.320
No.

27:10.080 --> 27:11.680
And then we can head out.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.920
Willy, that's the way it works.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.600
We give them something,
and they leave us alone.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.000
- You know I hate this stuff.
- It's really not much.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.720
It's already been
a thousand times more than I agreed to.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.520
And I've tried to protect you from it
as much as possible,

27:26.520 --> 27:29.720
but I'm afraid it's just... something
we've all got to learn to live with.

27:29.720 --> 27:30.800
But I hate it.

27:31.640 --> 27:35.600
Hate the press. Hate the crowds.
Why tell us we're going somewhere alone,

27:35.600 --> 27:38.440
then put us in front of the people
we hate most in the world?

27:38.440 --> 27:42.040
[Charles] I know.
It's insufferable, but... getting angry

27:42.040 --> 27:45.680
and refusing to go out there
is not the way to endear yourself.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.680
I'm not the one
who needs to endear myself.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.640
I'm not the one with the image problem.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.960
[footsteps departing]

28:11.080 --> 28:12.400
That was pretty harsh.

28:13.440 --> 28:17.120
He did always say we'd have to combine
official duties with the holiday.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.640
[William] I don't care.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.800
It's true. He needs to hear it.

28:31.800 --> 28:32.760
[door shuts]

28:34.360 --> 28:36.360
[wind gusting]

28:37.560 --> 28:39.560
[somber music playing]

28:43.720 --> 28:45.720
[distant indistinct chatter]

28:52.720 --> 28:54.360
[man 1] Over here, William!

28:54.360 --> 28:55.720
[man 2] Smile, sir!

28:56.320 --> 28:59.120
- [man 3] William!
- Back here, Your Royal Highness!

28:59.120 --> 29:00.800
- William!
- Over here, William!

29:00.800 --> 29:03.280
- Prince William!
- William!

29:03.280 --> 29:05.360
[indistinct shouting continues]

29:09.760 --> 29:12.440
[Elizabeth] <i>That's the word
he used? "Hate"?</i>

29:12.440 --> 29:13.840
[Charles] Again and again.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.000
Hating the press is one thing.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.560
After what happened to his mother,
who can blame him?

29:20.120 --> 29:22.360
But having that attitude
towards the public...

29:23.560 --> 29:26.040
Not ideal for a future heir to the throne.

29:26.040 --> 29:30.400
Well, you know, we have to remember,
he is just a teenager.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.720
[Charles] Yes, but a teenager who went
back to school straight after the funeral

29:33.720 --> 29:37.680
and struggles to express his feelings
about his mother's death.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.800
Ah, well, that's not something
you can force.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.080
[Charles] It is something
you can encourage though.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.120
But the danger is that he'll simply

29:48.240 --> 29:49.520
shut all that away

29:50.360 --> 29:52.800
with terrible consequences later in life.

29:52.800 --> 29:57.320
Tears and self-pity aren't exactly
common currency in this family.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.760
[Charles] But it's not self-pity, is it?
It's grief.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.880
And for his own sake,
he needs to let it all out.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.800
Will you talk to him, Mummy?

30:08.320 --> 30:11.080
Sometimes it's easier
when it's not the parent.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.480
You know how fond he is of you.

30:13.480 --> 30:17.640
[Elizabeth] But isn't this precisely
where a parent is most needed?

30:18.600 --> 30:20.600
[light instrumental music builds slowly]

30:48.040 --> 30:50.040
[projector whirring]

31:56.160 --> 31:57.240
[projector clicks]

32:04.760 --> 32:06.840
- [William] Can I have one of the peppers?
- [woman] Yes.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.240
There you are.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.000
What would you like?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.280
I had a telephone call.

32:13.800 --> 32:17.240
The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh
would like to see you on Sunday for tea.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.680
- Okay. Thank you, sir.
- [woman] Potato?

32:23.600 --> 32:24.680
What would you like?

32:36.800 --> 32:37.680
Sir.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.320
Prince William, Your Royal Highness.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.240
Granny and Grandpa?

33:01.400 --> 33:02.520
[Charles] Uh...

33:02.520 --> 33:04.280
They decided to leave us to it.

33:06.040 --> 33:09.120
Or rather they told me
that we should be left to it.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.240
And I agreed that was best.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.520
[scoffing] Why?

33:15.400 --> 33:18.160
- Because you and I need to talk.
- What about?

33:22.600 --> 33:24.520
You're angry with me.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.960
I'm not angry with you.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.360
Come on, it's obvious. I can feel it.

33:30.880 --> 33:35.040
The press and all this unwanted
new attention that you've been getting,

33:35.840 --> 33:37.040
they might have upset you,

33:37.040 --> 33:40.760
but really all your frustrations
have been pointed at me.

33:40.760 --> 33:42.120
Is it any wonder?

33:42.120 --> 33:43.640
Well, to me, it is, yes.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.320
Frankly, I'm at a loss.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.480
[William scoffs]

33:48.600 --> 33:50.360
Well, don't just smirk.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.360
Help me to understand.

33:57.480 --> 33:58.560
For a start, you...

33:59.560 --> 34:02.040
you never talk about her.
<i>We</i> never talk about her.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.200
I agree, and we should talk about her.
The more the better.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.200
About her life, about

34:08.160 --> 34:09.400
our memories of her.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.960
Why do you think I wouldn't want that?

34:11.960 --> 34:15.120
Perhaps you don't like
to be reminded how we got to this point.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.320
Don't you think
there might be a connection

34:18.320 --> 34:20.560
between where we all are now
and your part in it?

34:23.760 --> 34:26.360
I hope you're not insinuating
what I think you are.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.280
Let us be quite clear.

34:38.800 --> 34:41.440
Your mother's death
was a terrible tragedy,

34:42.680 --> 34:46.280
caused by one irresponsible man
drinking too much,

34:46.960 --> 34:49.680
then getting behind the wheel of a car
and driving too fast

34:49.680 --> 34:51.240
to escape from photographers.

34:52.120 --> 34:54.520
Which you and I both know
she often encouraged.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.160
The fact that she was in Paris?

34:56.160 --> 34:58.160
- Her choice.
- With that man? Those people?

34:58.160 --> 35:00.640
- Again, her choice.
- Without any royal protection!

35:00.640 --> 35:04.280
That was not my doing. I always said
she needed police protection.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.200
But she should never have
been anywhere near the Fayeds!

35:07.880 --> 35:11.520
She should have been safe with us.
The fact that she wasn't <i>is</i> your fault.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.080
No, you didn't actually drive the car,

35:16.080 --> 35:18.400
but you drove her into the arms
of those that did.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.880
By making her so unhappy.

35:23.400 --> 35:24.800
By loving someone else.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.880
Well, if you want to make that

35:38.960 --> 35:40.000
connection, then...

35:42.240 --> 35:43.680
that's your right, but...

35:45.680 --> 35:47.560
I find it very upsetting, and

35:48.480 --> 35:50.080
deeply unkind.

35:52.240 --> 35:56.320
My responsibility for Mummy ended
a long time before she got to Paris.

35:58.560 --> 36:02.240
That accident was not in any way my fault.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.920
And to even suggest it was is...
is outrageous.

36:06.920 --> 36:07.880
[William] Is it?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.240
Yes.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.560
I resent the accusation.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.280
With everything else
you've started to resent about me?

36:16.960 --> 36:21.120
I don't know what you're talking about.
I could not be more proud of you.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.960
Proud of how you've come through this,
proud of how you're growing up,

36:25.960 --> 36:27.440
proud of your popularity.

36:27.440 --> 36:32.040
Since when have you taken pleasure
in anyone else's popularity?

36:33.240 --> 36:35.840
- We both know you struggle being upstaged.
- Nonsense.

36:35.840 --> 36:36.840
It's true.

36:36.840 --> 36:40.800
All those games of one-upmanship
you and Mummy used to play.

36:40.800 --> 36:44.440
Stories in the press.
Stealing each other's headlines.

36:44.440 --> 36:47.880
- Always tried to outshine one another.
- No one ever outshone your mother.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.160
You think I'm just like her.
And you hate me for it.

36:53.040 --> 36:53.920
William.

36:53.920 --> 36:56.000
William, look, I admit, I...

36:58.160 --> 37:00.920
[sighs] It... it has been strange.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.880
Unnerving, perhaps,
to see the... similarities.

37:07.680 --> 37:08.680
The way the...

37:09.760 --> 37:12.400
crowds connect with you, adore you,

37:12.400 --> 37:15.520
the way you... move something in them.

37:17.680 --> 37:21.640
And, yes, all right, I'm...
still getting used to it because I...

37:25.040 --> 37:26.720
I do see her in you.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.360
But that's not a bad thing.
In fact, it's a rather wonderful thing.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.800
And it's only natural

37:36.880 --> 37:38.720
between a son and his mother.

37:40.520 --> 37:41.360
Look, I...

37:42.960 --> 37:45.200
I know I haven't got everything right.

37:45.880 --> 37:50.320
What parent does? I wish I had
half your mother's emotional intelligence.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.320
And I'm sorry I haven't

37:54.360 --> 37:55.760
risen to the occasion

37:56.760 --> 37:59.000
in the way that you wanted me to, but

38:00.640 --> 38:04.200
the thing that people don't understand is
that I've been grieving too.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.040
Really?

38:09.480 --> 38:12.920
<i>Your</i> grief.
You're talking to me about your grief?

38:12.920 --> 38:14.520
Yes, of course.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.720
What? You think I'm not shattered by this?

38:19.400 --> 38:22.160
Your mother and I had just
patched up our differences. We'd--

38:22.160 --> 38:23.840
Patched up your differences?

38:25.080 --> 38:26.520
What planet are you on?

38:28.160 --> 38:29.360
She still loved you,

38:30.200 --> 38:32.200
and only wanted to be
in the South of France

38:32.200 --> 38:35.480
so not to be there when you threw
a birthday party for the other one.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.400
[door shuts]

38:47.920 --> 38:49.920
[choir singing melancholy tune]

39:47.560 --> 39:48.720
[choir singing stops]

39:49.240 --> 39:50.080
[Philip] Oh.

39:50.080 --> 39:53.200
I hope you don't mind.
Dr. Gailey let me in.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.520
[upbeat music playing through walls]

39:56.320 --> 39:57.160
[William] Sorry.

39:57.760 --> 39:59.960
Oh, nothing to be ashamed of.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.160
Do they have names?

40:05.520 --> 40:09.560
That's, uh, Claudia Schiffer,
Cindy Crawford, and Naomi Campbell.

40:10.600 --> 40:14.320
In my day, it was Rita Hayworth,
Betty Grable, and Lana Turner.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.160
Mean anything to you?

40:16.680 --> 40:18.440
- No.
- [chuckling] No, of course not.

40:19.280 --> 40:21.280
[appliances humming softly]

40:40.760 --> 40:42.160
[Philip] That was reckless.

40:43.160 --> 40:46.040
You went charging in
like some deranged Viking.

40:51.960 --> 40:52.840
[Philip] Oh!

40:52.840 --> 40:53.960
And again.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.120
[William] Oh shit.

40:55.640 --> 40:56.520
Language.

41:03.280 --> 41:04.200
Oh...

41:04.880 --> 41:06.000
Revenge?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.000
No.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.920
Not when you're in this state.

41:11.480 --> 41:14.280
One should never play chess
with one's emotions.

41:19.600 --> 41:20.720
So, what's going on?

41:24.880 --> 41:25.880
Family.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.280
Oh, family.

41:29.560 --> 41:31.880
Psychologists are fairly evenly split

41:31.880 --> 41:36.240
between those who think a child should
never be separated from its family

41:36.240 --> 41:40.640
and those who think the sooner
it's rescued from its family the better.

41:41.160 --> 41:42.880
It's not everyone in the family.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.200
It's just you-know-who.

41:46.880 --> 41:47.800
Yes, well,

41:48.480 --> 41:50.960
before we talk about you and your father...

41:51.600 --> 41:53.320
I'm assuming it's your father.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.280
...I want to talk to you
about something else.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.000
Back pain.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.400
- What?
- I get it from time to time.

42:02.400 --> 42:06.240
And when I do,
I find it easier to label it just that.

42:07.640 --> 42:10.120
Back pain or neck pain or shoulder pain.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.440
Rather than what's actually causing it.

42:17.480 --> 42:18.880
Unresolved anger.

42:20.480 --> 42:21.680
Feelings of guilt.

42:22.800 --> 42:23.680
Or resentment.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.920
I don't resent him.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.880
He resents me.

42:28.400 --> 42:31.760
Oh, no, for what it's worth,
I don't think that's true.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.120
But maybe you're angry with your father

42:35.120 --> 42:37.880
because it's more acceptable
than admitting

42:38.960 --> 42:40.680
who you're really angry with.

42:46.360 --> 42:51.320
It occurred to me when I was... watching you
in Greenwich with all those girls.

42:52.520 --> 42:53.720
And then in Toronto.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
Vancouver.

42:55.640 --> 42:59.400
All of a sudden, you've become
a public figure. Public property.

43:00.840 --> 43:02.040
And that isn't easy.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.320
I hate it.

43:07.280 --> 43:10.600
All the screaming and the shouting
and all the attention.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.240
It's as if they think because I...

43:19.720 --> 43:21.720
look like her, I'm <i>like</i> her.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.200
You're not remotely like her.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.400
I know that.

43:27.600 --> 43:32.320
So, is it possible you're angry with her
for having been all the things you're not?

43:33.720 --> 43:35.440
Comfortable in the spotlight.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.560
Confident in front of an adoring crowd,

43:38.560 --> 43:41.720
which you think you now have to be.

43:42.320 --> 43:43.600
- And hate.
<i>- </i>  Hmm.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.840
And is it possible
you're angry with her because,

43:50.400 --> 43:52.360
well, because of her leaving you?

43:53.880 --> 43:56.320
And leaving you to deal with that legacy?

44:01.320 --> 44:02.560
Except,

44:02.560 --> 44:05.920
what son can ever be angry
with his mother?

44:10.600 --> 44:13.960
Especially when he's grieving... for her

44:15.840 --> 44:17.520
and missing her so terribly.

44:23.320 --> 44:25.440
So you take it out on someone else.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.840
And blame him

44:29.800 --> 44:31.520
for the fact that she's gone.

44:38.680 --> 44:43.240
An accusation I'm sure
he's leveled at himself a hundred times.

44:45.680 --> 44:46.680
As have we all.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.120
But it's not our fault.

44:53.800 --> 44:55.160
And it's not his fault.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.040
And one day,

45:05.360 --> 45:06.720
when you're a father

45:08.080 --> 45:12.320
and your own son is staring at you
with murderous eyes,

45:13.000 --> 45:15.280
and you're praying for his forgiveness,

45:16.080 --> 45:18.960
as your father is
currently praying for yours...

45:20.320 --> 45:21.960
[sighs] ...and as I have on

45:22.880 --> 45:26.040
shamefully too few occasions
prayed for his...

45:30.280 --> 45:31.120
well...

45:34.880 --> 45:36.680
maybe remember this chat.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.440
[birds calling]

46:18.560 --> 46:19.560
Off you go.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.600
- Is my father in his study?
- In the garden, sir.

46:25.600 --> 46:26.600
Thank you.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.680
[somber music playing]

47:23.000 --> 47:23.840
Hi, Pa.

47:24.960 --> 47:25.800
Willy.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.200
What are you doing here, old chap?

47:32.480 --> 47:33.960
I thought you'd be at school.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.280
[projector whirring]

48:14.360 --> 48:15.920
[exhales slowly]

48:38.960 --> 48:40.960
[wind gusting softly]

48:47.440 --> 48:49.440
[birds singing]

49:22.400 --> 49:24.400
[somber music swells]

49:57.760 --> 49:59.760
[somber music fades and resumes]

51:12.960 --> 51:14.760
[somber music fades out]
