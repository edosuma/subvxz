WEBVTT

00:10.502 --> 00:11.730
Here you go, Cindy,

00:11.770 --> 00:14.000
enough pinecones for a fire
every night this winter.

00:14.039 --> 00:16.337
And if that isn't enough,
we'll go raid the next block.

00:16.375 --> 00:17.774
With the winds
blowing like they are,

00:17.810 --> 00:19.209
the streets are littered
with these things.

00:19.244 --> 00:21.906
Oh, no, this'll be
just fine, thank you.

00:21.947 --> 00:24.381
l want to give you a bag
to take over to Jackie.

00:24.416 --> 00:25.405
l don't think she knows

00:25.451 --> 00:27.180
-how to start a fire.
-No chance.

00:27.219 --> 00:28.208
-Well...
-But we'll use them

00:28.253 --> 00:29.345
at the apartment.

00:29.388 --> 00:31.219
Did you know that l got
the highest points

00:31.256 --> 00:32.655
in my Brownie troop
for fire-building?

00:32.691 --> 00:35.683
Well. That is quite an
accomplishment, Kelly.

00:35.727 --> 00:37.024
l am very proud of you.

00:37.062 --> 00:39.155
Well, unlike my flippant
son, l am proud of you.

00:39.198 --> 00:40.790
l hear you're gonna
be on the cover

00:40.833 --> 00:41.822
of Seventeen magazine.

00:44.369 --> 00:45.961
Didn't l tell you
to keep that

00:46.004 --> 00:47.699
a secret?

00:47.739 --> 00:48.933
l'm gonna go make some tea.

00:48.974 --> 00:50.703
Would either of you
two like a cup?

00:50.742 --> 00:51.902
lt's not official yet.

00:51.944 --> 00:53.502
l mean, they liked
the pictures

00:53.545 --> 00:54.569
and they're talking
big plans,

00:54.613 --> 00:56.706
but who knows
what will happen.

00:56.748 --> 00:58.716
Kelly, this is
so exciting.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.149
You better watch it, Kel.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.709
Next thing you know, you're
gonna be

01:01.753 --> 01:03.345
a big supermodel.

01:03.388 --> 01:06.516
Billy Joel's gonna
be calling you.

01:06.558 --> 01:08.992
Well, there he is
right there.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.655
Remember, Kel, he's still on
the rebound from Christie.

01:11.697 --> 01:12.664
Okay.

01:12.698 --> 01:13.858
Hello?

01:13.899 --> 01:14.991
l have an international

01:15.033 --> 01:17.297
person-to-person call
for Brandon Walsh.

01:17.336 --> 01:19.861
l'll accept that call.

01:19.905 --> 01:20.997
Hello, Brenda.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.199
No, not Brenda.

01:22.241 --> 01:24.675
Um... ls Brandon there?

01:24.710 --> 01:26.803
Just a minute.

01:26.845 --> 01:27.937
lt's for you.

01:33.252 --> 01:34.310
This is Brandon.

01:34.353 --> 01:36.412
Hi, this is Emily.

01:36.455 --> 01:39.219
Well, howdy, stranger.

01:39.258 --> 01:41.021
A blast from the past, huh?

01:41.059 --> 01:42.117
l'll say.

01:42.161 --> 01:44.595
So, where are you?

01:44.630 --> 01:46.894
Well, right now l'm in Paris,

01:46.932 --> 01:50.026
but l'm getting on a plane
for the States tomorrow.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.695
Really.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.762
Yeah, and l have a layover
in L.A. tomorrow night.

01:53.805 --> 01:54.999
l was hoping you'd be around.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.565
l'll be here.

01:57.609 --> 01:58.906
Great!

01:58.944 --> 02:00.912
Yeah.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.538
Great.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.919 --> 03:14.977
You're welcome.

03:15.053 --> 03:16.850
Ah, Nat, you must have
been expecting us.

03:16.888 --> 03:18.185
You know what?

03:18.223 --> 03:19.781
These walls are screaming,

03:19.825 --> 03:21.986
screaming, for some of
these. What do you say?

03:22.027 --> 03:23.551
My walls are
your walls.

03:23.595 --> 03:24.653
Go for it.

03:24.696 --> 03:25.856
-Thank you.
-Excellent.

03:25.897 --> 03:26.989
Put a couple
over there.

03:27.032 --> 03:27.999
Put some in
the bathroom.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.192
By the phone.

03:29.234 --> 03:31.600
''The Steve Sanders
Holiday Rave''?

03:31.637 --> 03:33.662
Yeah, it should say

03:33.705 --> 03:35.536
the ''Steve Sanders
and Griffin Stone

03:35.574 --> 03:36.973
Holiday Rave,'' but
who's noticing?

03:37.009 --> 03:38.203
Oh, boy, here
we go again.

03:38.243 --> 03:39.870
Who dreamed this
baby up, huh?

03:39.911 --> 03:41.003
Who got you the house?

03:41.046 --> 03:42.013
House?

03:42.047 --> 03:43.014
What house?

03:43.048 --> 03:44.345
We're throwing the rave

03:44.383 --> 03:46.214
in a Hancock Park
mansion this weekend.

03:46.251 --> 03:48.276
Hancock Park? What's
wrong with the rug store?

03:48.320 --> 03:49.878
The rug store is not
gonna be ready

03:49.921 --> 03:51.912
for another three weeks and
the rave's gotta go on.

03:51.957 --> 03:53.857
Whatever.

03:53.892 --> 03:54.916
Don't worry.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.018
l'm not deserting you.

03:56.094 --> 03:57.686
l have every intention
of cutting you in.

03:57.729 --> 03:59.026
Oh, nah. Come on, you want

03:59.064 --> 04:01.032
to throw an independent
party, no sweat.

04:01.066 --> 04:03.967
We're not joined
at the hip. Okay?

04:04.002 --> 04:05.594
Thanks.

04:05.637 --> 04:07.662
You know what? l gotta
make a few phone calls.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.105
ln the meantime,
put the word out

04:09.141 --> 04:10.335
that we're hurting
for a truck,

04:10.375 --> 04:13.310
and hand out some of
these, why don't you?

04:13.345 --> 04:14.676
Aye, aye, Captain.

04:21.219 --> 04:22.516
Hey.

04:22.554 --> 04:23.646
Look what l found

04:23.689 --> 04:25.623
on Brandon's windshield
this morning.

04:25.657 --> 04:27.352
l hope you can come.

04:29.027 --> 04:31.188
Do you need any help
getting it off the ground?

04:31.229 --> 04:33.527
Nah, l got
everything covered.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.432
Oh, come on, there must be a
zillion details to deal with.

04:36.468 --> 04:37.526
What about publicity?

04:37.569 --> 04:38.661
l've got that covered.

04:38.704 --> 04:40.137
David and Clare
are gonna post it

04:40.172 --> 04:41.161
on some electronic

04:41.206 --> 04:42.537
bulletin board.

04:42.574 --> 04:46.635
Well, then l'll help
in some other way.

04:46.678 --> 04:49.374
l'll pass the flyers
out-- something.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.678
You know, we had
a pretty good time

04:51.717 --> 04:53.708
throwing the other
rave, don't you think?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.151
That was very different.

04:58.156 --> 05:00.124
You know we made
a good team.

05:03.662 --> 05:05.960
Okay, you know what?

05:05.997 --> 05:07.624
Pass some of these out.

05:07.666 --> 05:08.860
Anything for the party.

05:56.181 --> 05:58.877
''Multi-room extravaganza...

05:58.917 --> 06:01.010
9:00. Tomorrow night.

06:01.052 --> 06:02.280
Be there.''

06:02.320 --> 06:04.788
Okay, all info in?

06:04.823 --> 06:08.156
Yeah, l think l'll name
it... ''Holiday Rave.''

06:08.193 --> 06:09.251
Okay, good.

06:09.294 --> 06:10.955
Okay, now just
pick the Delphi forum

06:10.996 --> 06:12.224
where you want it posted.

06:14.299 --> 06:15.266
Oh, man,

06:15.300 --> 06:16.961
there's a lot
of choices....

06:17.002 --> 06:19.163
Okay, look for
''Twentysomethings,''

06:19.204 --> 06:20.193
''College Parties,''

06:20.238 --> 06:21.865
-something like that.
-Oops.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.308
''Oops''?

06:24.342 --> 06:26.310
What's that?

06:26.344 --> 06:28.312
Well, l just dropped it
in the wrong forum,

06:28.346 --> 06:30.314
but that's okay.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.315
Let's see here.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.976
Retrieved...

06:33.018 --> 06:34.986
Reposted...

06:35.020 --> 06:37.147
Bingo. Mission
accomplished.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.520
You sure?

06:38.557 --> 06:39.990
Clare, l know
what l'm doing.

06:40.091 --> 06:40.989
Okay.

06:41.092 --> 06:41.990
Hey!

06:42.093 --> 06:43.993
How's it going in
the cyber-world?

06:44.029 --> 06:45.496
Rave-mania lives.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.397
So, are they still
looking for musical acts?

06:48.433 --> 06:49.627
Yeah, as far
as l know.

06:49.668 --> 06:51.636
Ray, that'd be
perfect for you.

06:51.670 --> 06:53.001
Let me talk to Steve.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.199
Thanks, but l don't think
l could prep for it

06:55.240 --> 06:56.537
on such short notice.

06:56.575 --> 06:57.872
Yes, you could.

06:57.909 --> 06:59.536
You have some
great material.

06:59.578 --> 07:02.945
l don't think your friend
Griffin would go for it.

07:02.981 --> 07:04.039
We'll see.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.641
Beware. We've entered
''couples only'' zone.

07:07.686 --> 07:09.278
Good, then we can
all triple date

07:09.321 --> 07:10.310
to the rave tomorrow night.

07:10.355 --> 07:12.755
No, we can't.

07:12.791 --> 07:14.281
Why not?

07:14.326 --> 07:16.954
l gotta pick up an old
friend at the airport.

07:16.995 --> 07:18.656
l'll be in my room.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.489
So, uh, who you
picking up, Brandon?

07:22.534 --> 07:24.934
Emily Valentine.

07:24.970 --> 07:26.938
Emily?

07:26.972 --> 07:29.702
Wait, wasn't that
that fire-starter girl?

07:31.209 --> 07:33.006
You slay me, Silver.

07:36.781 --> 07:39.511
Kel, will you stop
the bombing.

07:39.551 --> 07:40.984
Emily is just a friend.

07:41.019 --> 07:42.179
According to Brenda,

07:42.220 --> 07:45.314
she was more than that
last Thanksgiving.

07:45.357 --> 07:47.655
Yes. Well, that
was last Thanksgiving

07:47.692 --> 07:49.660
and this is this Thanksgiving,

07:49.694 --> 07:51.662
and there's something else
added into the equation here,

07:51.696 --> 07:52.856
and that would be you.

07:52.898 --> 07:54.525
l didn't want
to get into this,

07:54.566 --> 07:57.194
and maybe l'm
being petty...

07:57.235 --> 07:59.135
but what happened with you
guys in San Francisco?

07:59.170 --> 08:00.660
We spent the weekend together,

08:00.705 --> 08:02.070
She left for France. That's it.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.369
Don't whitewash
this, Brandon.

08:05.477 --> 08:06.671
Okay.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.942
l fell for her.

08:11.983 --> 08:13.382
But that was ''B.K.''--

08:13.418 --> 08:14.976
Before Kelly.

08:17.656 --> 08:20.147
So your feelings
for her are gone?

08:20.191 --> 08:23.285
Gone. Gone, gone,
absolutely, completely,

08:23.328 --> 08:25.660
utterly gone.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.065
-Okay?
-Okay.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.533
Good.

08:33.238 --> 08:34.967
Sorry.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.006
l'm sorry, too.

08:38.342 --> 08:42.677
-Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
-What is it?

08:46.484 --> 08:48.645
Oh, yeah!

08:48.687 --> 08:50.177
This is gonna be great.

08:50.221 --> 08:51.984
This will be our main
dance floor down here.

08:52.057 --> 08:53.854
We can fit a hundred,
150 people down here.

08:53.892 --> 08:55.689
-What do you think?
-We have to leave room

08:55.727 --> 08:56.716
for the lighting equipment.

08:56.761 --> 08:58.319
Which l hear we have
to move tomorrow.

08:58.363 --> 08:59.853
Boy, that stuff
is heavy, too.

08:59.898 --> 09:01.832
Guys, we still need
a truck, though.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.602
Okay, l'm gonna
set up the food

09:05.637 --> 09:06.865
by the window over here.

09:06.905 --> 09:07.929
Nat recommended a guy

09:07.973 --> 09:10.464
who makes Mexican
food beautifully.

09:11.643 --> 09:12.871
What are we, uh, caterers?

09:12.911 --> 09:14.811
Why don't we buy
some chips and soda,

09:14.846 --> 09:15.938
keep it simple?

09:15.981 --> 09:17.744
This is not a caterer, okay?

09:17.782 --> 09:19.750
lt's a guy who cooks
some food, cheap.

09:19.784 --> 09:22.412
Keep in mind this is
just the downstairs.

09:22.454 --> 09:24.479
lf you get sick of
the action down here,

09:24.522 --> 09:26.183
you go kick it
upstairs in one

09:26.224 --> 09:27.885
of the ''mood rooms.''

09:27.926 --> 09:29.223
And you want to do all this

09:29.260 --> 09:30.420
-by tomorrow?
-Yes.

09:36.001 --> 09:37.093
You're dreaming, man.

09:37.135 --> 09:38.329
Unless you got
a magic wand,

09:38.370 --> 09:39.769
l don't see any
of this happening

09:39.804 --> 09:41.066
within the next 24 hours.

09:41.106 --> 09:42.869
You better go get your
vision checked then, Stone.

09:42.907 --> 09:45.307
Great.

09:45.343 --> 09:46.640
Second time this
fuse has blown.

09:46.678 --> 09:48.873
Another problem we have
to solve before tomorrow.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.649
lt's that fuse
in the kitchen.

09:52.684 --> 09:56.176
Must be 40 years
old or more.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.654
Well, excuse me
for not finding

09:57.689 --> 09:59.316
an optimum party
house that has

09:59.357 --> 10:01.086
state-of-the-art electricity.

10:01.126 --> 10:02.525
You know, l'm getting
a little sick

10:02.560 --> 10:03.993
of your lip, you know that?

10:04.029 --> 10:06.520
And l'm getting a little
sick of your ego.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.328
Uh, when you guys are done,
l'll, l'll give you these.

10:09.367 --> 10:10.664
What is this?

10:10.702 --> 10:13.330
Everything we need to get
done by tomorrow night,

10:13.371 --> 10:14.668
split three ways.

10:14.706 --> 10:17.038
lt's gonna be tight,
but l think we can do it

10:19.811 --> 10:22.336
Now, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

10:22.380 --> 10:24.211
No. Not at all.

10:29.721 --> 10:31.450
Hey, wait a second.

10:31.489 --> 10:33.719
You mind if l ask you why
you're being so helpful?

10:33.758 --> 10:36.886
What makes you think
l have an ulterior motive?

10:36.928 --> 10:40.022
l know you, Valerie.

10:40.065 --> 10:41.555
What's going on?
What do you want?

10:41.599 --> 10:44.466
Well, there is
something l want.

10:44.502 --> 10:46.493
A piece of the action?

10:46.538 --> 10:47.698
ls that it?

10:47.739 --> 10:48.967
Sort of.

10:49.007 --> 10:51.601
Well, let me guess. You want
a cut of the front door.

10:51.643 --> 10:54.237
l want another chance with you.

11:44.896 --> 11:47.660
l'll call you
as soon as l get there

11:47.699 --> 11:49.963
and give you my phone number.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.992
Don't forget.

11:55.206 --> 11:57.197
l won't forget.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.831
(door closes)

12:28.406 --> 12:30.374
Can't sleep?

12:30.408 --> 12:32.808
Not with these
hot winds blowing.

12:32.844 --> 12:34.471
Did l wake you up?

12:34.512 --> 12:37.743
No. The Santa Anas
get to me, too.

12:43.588 --> 12:45.954
You know, in the Middle East

12:45.990 --> 12:48.288
they have winds,
they're called the siroccos.

12:48.326 --> 12:50.556
They blow across
the northern desert of Africa,

12:50.595 --> 12:52.222
and while these winds
are blowing,

12:52.263 --> 12:53.389
if you kill somebody

12:53.431 --> 12:55.956
they won't even try
to punish you.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.400
Sort of like
temporary insanity?

12:58.436 --> 13:00.597
Kind of like
the heat of passion.

13:00.638 --> 13:02.538
lt's like a full moon,

13:02.574 --> 13:04.565
you know, our bodies
are full of so much water,

13:04.609 --> 13:07.772
the gravity starts pulling on us
in ways we don't even realize.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.108
lt's kind of like
a tide rising.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.616
What are you thinking?

13:26.331 --> 13:29.892
A lot happens in a year.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.265
Yeah.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.566
Come on, let's
go back to bed.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.224
Have you had any experience
with this kind of thing, Ed?

13:58.263 --> 14:00.561
Eduardo.
Yeah, experience.

14:00.598 --> 14:02.395
Anything this big,
though?

14:02.433 --> 14:03.832
Oh, yeah, big.

14:03.868 --> 14:05.267
All big gigs.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.567
Yeah, but l'm talking
really big. Huge.

14:07.605 --> 14:09.664
l'm gonna need enough
for 500 people.

14:09.707 --> 14:12.073
And l'm not talking
about punch and cookies.

14:12.110 --> 14:16.376
l'm talking about burritos,
nachos, the whole enchilada.

14:16.414 --> 14:18.814
Chicken or cheese?

14:18.850 --> 14:20.283
Whatever's cheaper.

14:20.318 --> 14:22.411
No problem.

14:22.453 --> 14:25.388
Valerie, could you show
mi amigo Eduardo,

14:25.423 --> 14:28.756
where the appliances
that work in the kitchen are?

14:28.793 --> 14:30.260
Yeah.

14:38.102 --> 14:41.970
Yes! Donna, you have no idea
how glad l am to see that.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.166
And you, too.

14:43.207 --> 14:44.265
Well, Valerie called
the apartment.

14:44.309 --> 14:46.277
She said you guys were
hard up for a truck.

14:46.311 --> 14:47.744
You are my savior.

14:47.779 --> 14:50.304
Yeah, well, you being the good
businessman that you are,

14:50.348 --> 14:53.010
you know there's no such thing
as a free lunch, right?

14:53.084 --> 14:54.949
Oh, boy, whatever happened

14:54.986 --> 14:57.318
to good old-fashioned charity
between friends, huh?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.879
Uh-huh.

14:58.923 --> 15:00.220
What do you want?

15:00.258 --> 15:02.920
You can have the truck--
if Ray can play

15:02.961 --> 15:05.156
in one of the
mood rooms tonight.

15:05.196 --> 15:08.097
Mm, looking out
for your man-- l like that.

15:08.132 --> 15:10.362
What kind of music
does he play?

15:10.401 --> 15:12.392
Ah, acoustic guitar,
mellow.

15:12.437 --> 15:15.600
l was thinking
perfect for the ''chill room.''

15:17.075 --> 15:18.770
All right, l'll bite.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.243
l like Ray.

15:20.278 --> 15:22.405
Cool, we've got a deal.

15:22.447 --> 15:23.971
Deal.

15:24.015 --> 15:25.983
Oh, oh, you're slick!

15:26.084 --> 15:27.551
S-L-l-C-K.

15:27.585 --> 15:29.644
-That'd be me!
-Oh, get in!

15:29.687 --> 15:31.086
l'll take you home!

15:31.122 --> 15:33.147
Well, they must know
what they're doing here,

15:33.191 --> 15:35.091
because you look great.

15:35.126 --> 15:37.094
Yeah, it's all
the good food,

15:37.128 --> 15:39.096
long hours of
drug-free sleep.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.325
Hell, they even
make me exercise.

15:41.366 --> 15:43.732
Fill my days with
hours of therapy.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.396
Well, sounds like
you're on the road back.

15:46.437 --> 15:48.405
Well, we'll see.

15:48.439 --> 15:51.203
So, what are you doing
to fill your days?

15:51.242 --> 15:55.008
lf l tell you, you have to
promise not to criticize.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.512
Notice the
charm bracelet--

15:56.547 --> 16:00.005
it means l don't have the
right to criticize anybody.

16:00.118 --> 16:02.951
Well, l've been doing
some modeling.

16:03.054 --> 16:06.854
l may even have a cover
of a magazine coming out soon.

16:06.891 --> 16:08.859
Wow.

16:08.893 --> 16:12.522
l know you think it sounds silly
and shallow and all that.

16:12.563 --> 16:14.861
Did l say silly?
Did l say shallow?

16:14.899 --> 16:17.493
No, but you were
thinking it.

16:17.535 --> 16:19.162
No, l wasn't.

16:19.203 --> 16:21.330
l was thinking you've come
a long way from the girl

16:21.372 --> 16:23.499
who thought the only reason
l fell in love with her

16:23.541 --> 16:26.271
was because she was
voted ''Most Beautiful.''

16:27.311 --> 16:30.838
Yeah, l guess somehow
l got past that.

16:30.882 --> 16:33.680
''Most Beautiful'' or not,

16:33.718 --> 16:37.711
l'd have fallen in love
with you either way, Kel.

16:44.729 --> 16:47.425
So, uh, how's Brandon?

16:49.367 --> 16:51.028
Good.

16:54.739 --> 16:58.266
You seeing him?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.970
Yeah.

17:01.546 --> 17:03.537
Yeah, that's real good.

17:06.084 --> 17:09.541
l'm not gonna
pretend it's easy.

17:09.587 --> 17:10.747
lt's not.

17:10.788 --> 17:14.246
l got a lot of time here
to think about it.

17:14.291 --> 17:17.522
l realized a lot of my
problems started right...

17:17.561 --> 17:20.359
when l lost you.

17:20.397 --> 17:22.161
l'm sorry.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.963
l'm not.

17:24.035 --> 17:25.969
lt's better that
one of us be happy

17:26.037 --> 17:29.871
than both of us being miserable.

17:29.907 --> 17:33.274
Are you miserable?

17:33.311 --> 17:35.802
l was.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.714
Now l'm just terrified.

17:48.126 --> 17:50.094
-Hey, Bran.
-Hey, chief.

17:50.128 --> 17:52.323
l heard you were gonna
be dropping off Hannah.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.694
What can l say,
your parents

17:53.731 --> 17:55.323
are the best
baby-sitters in town.

17:55.366 --> 17:56.958
You and Jesse going
to Steve's rave?

17:57.001 --> 17:58.093
Mm-mm. You?

17:58.136 --> 17:59.569
No, no.

17:59.604 --> 18:01.333
l think you have a hair
out of place over there.

18:01.372 --> 18:02.634
Really?

18:02.673 --> 18:04.868
-Ah...
-Ah...

18:06.177 --> 18:07.940
So, is all this
nervous energy

18:08.045 --> 18:10.036
because you're gonna be
seeing Emily tonight?

18:12.817 --> 18:16.344
All right, keep this
in this room, okay?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.581
Okay.

18:17.622 --> 18:19.715
l thought l was over Emily,

18:19.757 --> 18:22.521
but then when l heard her
voice again on the phone,

18:22.560 --> 18:23.720
something hit me.

18:23.761 --> 18:25.752
And?

18:25.796 --> 18:27.525
And now l can't stop
thinking about her.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.964
l always knew you guys

18:29.033 --> 18:32.127
were more than just
a flash in the pan.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.968
Especially when you
disappeared last Thanksgiving.

18:35.072 --> 18:36.869
l feel guilty even
talking about it.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.933
l mean, l really love Kelly.

18:38.976 --> 18:41.444
But you're still
in love with Emily?

18:41.479 --> 18:42.468
l don't think so.

18:42.513 --> 18:44.310
What can happen?

18:44.348 --> 18:45.940
lt's a four-hour layover, right?

18:45.983 --> 18:46.972
Right, probably nothing.

18:47.051 --> 18:48.848
You'll talk, you'll
catch up, nothing.

18:48.886 --> 18:50.649
Right, she'll go get
on her next plane,

18:50.688 --> 18:51.985
l'll go home to Kelly,

18:52.089 --> 18:54.319
and order will be restored
to the life of Brandon Walsh.

18:54.358 --> 18:55.985
One thing's for sure--

18:56.060 --> 18:58.119
you are in for a very
interesting evening.

18:58.162 --> 19:01.222
l'd probably be better off
going to Steve's rave.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.096
Probably.

19:03.134 --> 19:05.568
Yeah.

19:08.172 --> 19:10.197
l'm gonna play this, man.

19:10.241 --> 19:13.176
l got the hot burritos here.

19:16.347 --> 19:18.178
You know, l'm not one
to get party anxiety,

19:18.216 --> 19:19.478
but where is everybody?

19:19.517 --> 19:21.109
Steve, look,
it's only 9:30.

19:21.152 --> 19:23.586
What if we threw a rave
and nobody showed?

19:23.621 --> 19:25.521
Well, then we'd be
in major debt.

19:25.556 --> 19:26.716
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:26.757 --> 19:28.349
lt's about time
you guys showed up.

19:28.392 --> 19:30.860
Well, it's nice
to see you, too.

19:30.895 --> 19:32.522
l'm sorry, guys,
we're just all

19:32.563 --> 19:34.531
a little nervous about
the head count thing.

19:34.565 --> 19:37.125
Relax. People tend to show up
all at the same time.

19:37.168 --> 19:38.135
Yeah, they're already here--

19:38.169 --> 19:39.466
they're outside looking
for parking spots.

19:39.503 --> 19:41.596
Well, for my sake,
l hope you're right.

19:41.639 --> 19:44.472
Come on, guys, l'll show you
the house. Come on.

19:45.643 --> 19:47.338
Hey, it's a great house, man,

19:47.378 --> 19:50.506
but l was hoping there'd be
a lot more single women here.

19:53.417 --> 19:54.748
Hi.

19:54.785 --> 19:57.151
ls this the ''Holiday Rave''?

19:57.188 --> 19:58.985
Yes. Yes, it is.

19:59.056 --> 20:00.580
l don't think we're
in the right place.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.149
Wait a second. Uh...

20:02.193 --> 20:03.888
how'd you find
out about us?

20:03.928 --> 20:05.862
lt was online,
posted on the lnternet.

20:05.896 --> 20:06.988
Well, yeah, that's us.

20:07.098 --> 20:09.430
Ten bucks buys you food,
drink and good company.

20:10.468 --> 20:11.799
Okay.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.100
This is the
place, you guys.

20:14.138 --> 20:15.867
Two?

20:17.475 --> 20:19.306
Two.

20:24.915 --> 20:26.348
Both of you?

20:27.785 --> 20:29.013
Both... Two.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.020
Two.

20:30.087 --> 20:31.645
Two.

20:31.689 --> 20:33.680
Two.
Two.

20:38.863 --> 20:41.024
Clare?

20:41.132 --> 20:44.192
Silver?

20:44.235 --> 20:46.635
Hey, what's up, man?

20:46.671 --> 20:49.640
When you posted
this thing online,

20:49.674 --> 20:51.869
where exactly
did you post it?

20:51.909 --> 20:54.742
lt was the, uh,
''College Party Line.''

20:54.779 --> 20:59.375
Of course, at first l did
drop it in the wrong forum.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.749
That wouldn't have happened
to have been the...

21:01.786 --> 21:04.152
''Women Seeking Women,''
would it?

21:06.023 --> 21:08.856
Yeah, yeah,

21:08.893 --> 21:11.123
that was on the list,
if l do recall.

21:11.162 --> 21:12.390
Oh, boy!

21:12.430 --> 21:14.557
Oh, well,
the more the merrier.

21:19.637 --> 21:21.366
Dream on, Muntz.

21:23.941 --> 21:25.568
The music!

21:25.609 --> 21:26.940
Silver.

21:26.977 --> 21:29.138
Cover the door for me, okay?

21:34.452 --> 21:36.818
How many more fuses
do you got?

21:36.854 --> 21:38.617
-Just a couple.
-Well, hurry up.

21:38.656 --> 21:41.955
We can't afford
to have unhappy guests.

21:44.462 --> 21:46.953
Air Austria Flight #1 77

21:46.997 --> 21:48.624
-from Vienna, now arriving...
-Brandon!

21:48.666 --> 21:50.600
at gate 35.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.566
Emily.

21:53.604 --> 21:54.628
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:54.672 --> 21:56.401
Wow.

22:00.478 --> 22:03.106
Wow, it's really great
to see you again.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.944
Yeah, you, too.

22:04.982 --> 22:06.574
Here let me,
let me get this,

22:06.617 --> 22:09.415
Oh, you sure?

22:09.453 --> 22:11.614
Go ahead.

22:11.655 --> 22:14.852
So are you a certified
marine biologist now?

22:14.892 --> 22:16.519
Hardly.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.619
The Cousteau lnstitute program
is another three years.

22:18.662 --> 22:22.120
So, what are you doing
on this side of the pond?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.157
l'm taking a seminar at
the Scripps lnstitute.

22:24.201 --> 22:26.362
l thought l'd go and see
if they're as good

22:26.404 --> 22:27.666
as everyone
says they are.

22:27.705 --> 22:29.468
You're not transferring
to La Jolla, are you?

22:29.507 --> 22:30.940
l'm thinking about it.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.411
The marine labs there are some
of the best in the country.

22:34.445 --> 22:35.639
l don't know, Em.

22:35.679 --> 22:37.670
l don't think the surfer culture
of San Diego

22:37.715 --> 22:39.114
can compare
with the Brittany Coast.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.812
l'm no snob, although
l have to admit,

22:41.852 --> 22:43.114
it would be really
hard to leave France.

22:43.154 --> 22:44.212
lt agreed with you, huh?

22:44.255 --> 22:46.553
lt was love at first sight.

22:46.590 --> 22:49.855
So, you remember
Steve Sanders?

22:49.894 --> 22:51.384
Of course.

22:51.429 --> 22:53.590
Well, he's holding
a rave tonight,

22:53.631 --> 22:56.156
and he has personally
requested that you attend.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.031
To be honest, l'd really
rather avoid

22:58.102 --> 23:01.435
that whole
party scene thing.

23:01.472 --> 23:03.133
l wouldn't want you to think

23:03.174 --> 23:04.641
l'd returned to
my wild teenage ways.

23:04.675 --> 23:07.371
l've forgotten those days, Em.

23:07.411 --> 23:09.811
Well, l haven't.

23:09.847 --> 23:14.079
Come on, Em, our little
walk on the wild side

23:14.118 --> 23:15.585
was three years ago.

23:15.619 --> 23:17.985
You don't have to carry
that around with you still.

23:18.022 --> 23:21.753
''Let us forgive, but not forget,
lest we repeat ourselves''.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.761
There is also a little thing
called ''redemption.''

23:24.795 --> 23:27.525
l think you've earned
that by now.

23:27.565 --> 23:28.623
l love you.

23:33.604 --> 23:34.798
l'm sorry.

23:34.839 --> 23:36.272
That just slipped out.

23:36.307 --> 23:38.741
No, no, that's uh,
that's fine.

23:38.776 --> 23:40.573
l could really go
for a cup of coffee.

23:40.611 --> 23:42.408
What do you say we
hit the Pit?

23:42.446 --> 23:43.777
That would be great.

23:59.830 --> 24:02.390
Let's go upstairs.

24:18.983 --> 24:22.111
Don't worry about it,
l'll fix it.

24:22.152 --> 24:30.355
Power, power, power, power,
power, power, power, power,

24:30.394 --> 24:35.127
power, power, power, power,
power,

24:35.165 --> 24:37.827
power, power,

24:37.868 --> 24:38.926
power, power...

24:40.804 --> 24:42.965
lt's no good.
lt's too much power.

24:43.007 --> 24:44.167
Aw, it's fine.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.641
lt's just the little
ones keep blowing out.

24:45.676 --> 24:46.768
Too dangerous.

24:46.810 --> 24:48.903
Es muy peligroso, senor.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.744
l see, so you're a caterer
and an electrician?

24:51.782 --> 24:54.410
l'll tell you what, why don't
you worry about the food

24:54.451 --> 24:55.850
and let me worry
about the power?

25:05.863 --> 25:08.297
What's this?

25:08.332 --> 25:09.629
Not at Steve's rave?

25:09.667 --> 25:10.827
l'm actually, catching up

25:10.868 --> 25:11.960
with an old friend, Nat.

25:12.069 --> 25:13.331
You remember Emily?

25:13.370 --> 25:14.667
Oh, yeah, sure.

25:14.705 --> 25:15.967
Good to have you back.

25:16.006 --> 25:17.234
Thanks.

25:17.274 --> 25:19.105
Unfortunately, it's only
a short-term loan.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.771
l have to get her back at
the airport in a few hours.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.871
Well, better short and sweet
than not at all, right?

25:23.914 --> 25:25.211
That's right.

25:25.249 --> 25:27.149
-All right, see ya.
-Bye.

25:29.119 --> 25:30.484
You know, there's
something

25:30.521 --> 25:31.886
really comfortable
about this place.

25:31.922 --> 25:34.686
l guess that's why
l always come back here.

25:34.725 --> 25:39.685
lt reminds me of
old times, good times.

25:44.234 --> 25:46.794
So, l have a confession to make.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.401
Okay.

25:50.441 --> 25:52.807
l don't have another
flight tonight.

25:52.843 --> 25:56.438
l'm not due in La Jolla
until next week.

25:56.480 --> 25:59.005
But on the phone you said it
was a four-hour layover.

25:59.083 --> 26:01.677
Well, l could go
to San Francisco

26:01.719 --> 26:03.414
and visit my old friend Rosie.

26:03.454 --> 26:05.945
Or l can go to San Diego early.

26:06.056 --> 26:07.683
Or l could stay here.

26:07.725 --> 26:11.889
Why didn't you mention
this on the phone?

26:11.929 --> 26:13.954
Well, l didn't want
to scare you off.

26:14.064 --> 26:17.124
l wanted to see how things
were between us first.

26:17.167 --> 26:19.965
l see.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.870
So, how are things between us?

26:28.379 --> 26:31.109
l've got a girlfriend now, Em.

26:33.350 --> 26:34.681
Anyone l know?

26:34.718 --> 26:38.620
Actually, yes.
lt's Kelly Taylor.

26:38.656 --> 26:40.783
Boy, Kelly's about as
Beverly Hills as you can get.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.989
l'm sorry. That was wrong of me.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.825
No, that's okay.

26:46.864 --> 26:50.197
-She's changed a lot.
-l'm sure she has.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.397
Em, what'd you expect me to do?

26:53.437 --> 26:55.166
You said you'd call,
you never did.

26:55.205 --> 26:58.197
You said you'd write,
l didn't even get a postcard.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.005
l know, and l'm sorry.

27:00.044 --> 27:01.409
What happened?

27:03.280 --> 27:05.578
l guess l figured,
it'd be easier

27:05.616 --> 27:08.176
to forget things
if we didn't talk at all.

27:08.218 --> 27:09.947
l don't remember saying
l wanted to forget.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.784
But we agreed to live
separate lives.

27:12.823 --> 27:15.849
And l guess l didn't want
to hear about it

27:15.893 --> 27:17.451
if you were moving on.

27:17.494 --> 27:20.691
lt'd be too painful.

27:20.731 --> 27:22.858
l'm not blaming you.
l'm just disappointed.

27:22.900 --> 27:25.596
Didn't you date anybody
while you were in France?

27:25.636 --> 27:28.571
Yeah, l met a guy there, but...

27:28.605 --> 27:30.163
he wasn't you.

27:30.207 --> 27:33.665
l'm sorry.

27:33.711 --> 27:37.545
When l didn't hear
from you, l...

27:37.581 --> 27:38.980
l just gave up on us.

27:39.049 --> 27:41.415
Well, bummer for me, huh?

27:58.769 --> 28:00.999
Oh, my gosh.

28:01.105 --> 28:03.266
l've had my eye on this
woman all night long,

28:03.307 --> 28:04.774
and she's heading
right for me.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.207
Hi.

28:06.243 --> 28:07.369
Hi.

28:07.411 --> 28:08.742
Uh, would you like to dance?

28:08.779 --> 28:10.713
Well, actually,

28:10.748 --> 28:12.978
l came over here
to ask her to dance.

28:16.019 --> 28:19.648
Um, why don't we
all go dance.

28:19.690 --> 28:20.782
How about that?

28:20.824 --> 28:21.950
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:22.025 --> 28:23.322
Don't even
think about it.

28:47.251 --> 28:49.685
Do you realize that
we're practically

28:49.720 --> 28:52.587
the only male-female couple
out here on the dance floor?

28:52.623 --> 28:54.614
Well, l don't see
anyone complaining.

28:54.658 --> 28:56.956
l mean if a bunch of
gay men showed up,

28:56.994 --> 28:58.586
it would be a
different story.

28:58.629 --> 29:00.494
l doubt people would
be so cool.

29:00.531 --> 29:02.465
l went through this
in my fraternity last year.

29:02.499 --> 29:04.433
l gotta tell you,
you're absolutely right.

29:04.468 --> 29:06.333
Hey, guys, we got trouble.

29:06.370 --> 29:07.632
What's the matter?

29:07.671 --> 29:09.104
A couple of yahoos
are upstairs

29:09.139 --> 29:10.766
throwing water balloons
out the window.

29:10.808 --> 29:12.036
l hate yahoos!

29:12.075 --> 29:14.475
lf it's not one thing
it's another,

29:14.511 --> 29:16.274
Where are these yahoos?
Here?

29:18.916 --> 29:20.747
Hey, cut it out. Hey!

29:20.784 --> 29:23.309
Hey, man, lighten up.

29:23.353 --> 29:25.412
You guys, l think you
have the wrong place.

29:25.455 --> 29:28.219
This is a college party,
not Romper Room.

29:28.258 --> 29:29.589
Come on, it's funny.

29:29.626 --> 29:31.093
Oh yeah, a
regular scream.

29:31.128 --> 29:32.789
Beat it.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.293
You know, l didn't know
throwing a party

29:38.335 --> 29:41.065
would mean so much
damage control.

29:41.104 --> 29:43.504
You mean babysitting,
don't you?

29:43.540 --> 29:45.906
Well, it's annoying,
whatever you call it.

29:45.943 --> 29:48.503
Yeah.

29:48.545 --> 29:51.412
You know, l didn't even
know this room existed.

29:54.017 --> 29:55.917
Me either.

29:58.522 --> 29:59.921
lt's cozy.

29:59.957 --> 30:02.425
Yeah.

30:02.459 --> 30:03.721
Private.

30:06.864 --> 30:10.163
You know, l'm feeling
a little less annoyed?

30:10.200 --> 30:12.134
You are?

30:12.169 --> 30:14.831
-l am.
-Me, too.

30:20.277 --> 30:23.576
You know, l've missed
these arms around me.

30:23.614 --> 30:26.583
You have?

30:26.617 --> 30:28.482
l have.

30:33.857 --> 30:35.688
Valerie...

30:35.726 --> 30:38.024
you're not wearing
any underwear.

30:38.095 --> 30:40.086
You're kidding.

30:44.501 --> 30:47.868
You know, we just, uh,
we should stop this

30:47.905 --> 30:51.238
before we start something
we're not gonna finish.

30:51.275 --> 30:53.835
But l'm such a
strong finisher.

31:03.754 --> 31:05.881
Thanks for taking
this detour.

31:05.923 --> 31:07.413
l've really missed
the West Coast.

31:07.457 --> 31:09.982
Partial to the California
coast, are we?

31:10.027 --> 31:11.619
You know l am.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.391
And if we kept driving north,

31:13.430 --> 31:15.728
in about eight hours we'd end up
back in San Francisco.

31:15.766 --> 31:18.030
The way l drive,
we'd make it in six.

31:21.171 --> 31:24.163
lf we did go back, do you think
it would be the same?

31:24.207 --> 31:26.368
l don't know, it's kind of hard

31:26.410 --> 31:28.173
to recapture something
like that.

31:28.211 --> 31:30.338
The reality may not live up
to the memory.

31:30.380 --> 31:34.077
Or maybe it would be even
better than we remembered.

31:37.287 --> 31:39.278
But l don't think we're
going to find out.

31:39.323 --> 31:40.915
You know, Em,

31:40.958 --> 31:43.688
if you'd have asked me a year
ago to move up to San Francisco,

31:43.727 --> 31:44.921
l would have.

31:44.962 --> 31:47.021
l know.

31:47.097 --> 31:50.430
Chalk it up to bad timing.

31:52.169 --> 31:53.397
Ready to head back?

31:54.771 --> 31:56.398
Sure.

32:18.562 --> 32:19.893
Bye, you two.

32:19.930 --> 32:20.954
l won't wait up.

32:20.998 --> 32:22.522
Did Brandon ever show?

32:22.566 --> 32:25.000
No. And he was supposed to
be here over an hour ago.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.660
Yeah, well, Emily's plane
probably came in late.

32:26.703 --> 32:28.000
Right.

32:28.038 --> 32:29.767
You don't have to worry
about Brandon straying.

32:29.806 --> 32:31.933
Believe me, l know.

32:31.975 --> 32:35.001
Yeah, well, l'm probably
acting jealous, but humor me.

32:35.112 --> 32:36.170
His ex-girlfriend's in town

32:36.213 --> 32:38.147
and he's blown me off
for the night.

32:38.181 --> 32:40.672
l think l'm entitled to a little
jealousy at this point.

32:40.717 --> 32:42.344
Do you need a ride
or something?

32:42.386 --> 32:43.717
No, l'm gonna call a cab.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.187
-Bye.
-Okay, see ya.

33:01.705 --> 33:03.900
Why is it it seems like women
spend half their lives

33:03.940 --> 33:05.237
in line waiting
for the bathroom?

33:05.275 --> 33:07.835
Because we do.

33:07.878 --> 33:09.743
l'm Alison, by the way.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.374
Kelly.

33:12.416 --> 33:13.940
Well, happy waiting.

33:13.984 --> 33:15.781
Wait. Where are
you going?

33:15.819 --> 33:17.184
Uh, don't tell anyone,

33:17.220 --> 33:18.847
but l heard about
a bathroom downstairs

33:18.889 --> 33:19.878
that nobody knows about.

33:19.923 --> 33:21.049
All right,
l'm going with you.

33:28.698 --> 33:29.995
Alison...

33:30.033 --> 33:31.432
lt's not what
you think, okay?

33:31.468 --> 33:33.129
l'll be back
in five minutes.

33:34.771 --> 33:37.604
lt's supposed to be off limits,
but Steve will never know.

33:39.342 --> 33:41.572
Oh, what is this place?

33:41.611 --> 33:43.374
Looks like an old
screening room.

33:44.214 --> 33:46.409
lt's beautiful!
Yeah.

33:46.450 --> 33:48.782
l wonder who lived here.

33:48.819 --> 33:51.754
Some old movie mogul
from the '30s probably.

33:53.156 --> 33:56.148
So, the very first
screening of
Gone With The Wind

33:56.193 --> 33:58.627
could have taken place right
here, for all we know.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.323
Or was that the '40s?

34:00.363 --> 34:01.853
'39.

34:01.898 --> 34:04.196
Somebody knows
her movie history.

34:04.234 --> 34:06.099
Well, l'm in film school.

34:06.136 --> 34:08.195
l just had this class
on ''Films of the '30s,''

34:08.237 --> 34:11.206
so don't be too impressed.

34:11.241 --> 34:13.208
Wow! Listen to that.

34:13.243 --> 34:14.766
lt's completely
soundproof in here.

34:14.811 --> 34:17.974
Wow.

34:18.014 --> 34:21.347
One fine day, l'd like to have
a place like this in my house.

34:21.384 --> 34:23.851
But first things first.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.514
The bathroom.

34:25.554 --> 34:26.748
l'll be here.

34:26.790 --> 34:27.779
Okay.

35:11.067 --> 35:12.967
Where did Sanders
disappear to?

35:13.036 --> 35:15.596
Uh... upstairs.
Upstairs.

35:15.639 --> 35:17.197
Well, he's supposed
to be here.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.299
Can you cover for me?

35:19.342 --> 35:20.639
ln a sec, man.

35:20.677 --> 35:22.144
l gotta check
that fuse box.

35:22.179 --> 35:24.613
What's wrong with
the lights, man?

35:31.087 --> 35:32.577
Fire!

35:34.090 --> 35:35.387
Fire! Fire!

35:35.425 --> 35:36.824
Fire!

35:43.133 --> 35:44.725
Fire!

35:51.808 --> 35:54.242
Go, go, go, go, go!

35:59.816 --> 36:02.307
Fire! Come on!

36:06.556 --> 36:07.955
-You guys, relax.
-Stop running, you guys!

36:08.058 --> 36:10.492
Stop pushing. Take your time.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.775
We gotta get out of here!

36:39.256 --> 36:40.985
Oh, my God! We're dead!

36:41.091 --> 36:42.388
No. There's a back staircase.
Go this way!

36:42.425 --> 36:45.258
Follow these people out
and wait there, all right?

36:45.295 --> 36:46.626
No. Where are you going?

36:46.663 --> 36:48.096
l'm going to make sure
there's nobody else up here.

36:48.131 --> 36:49.621
Ray, you can't get
around those flames!

36:49.666 --> 36:51.031
Go! Go!

36:54.571 --> 36:56.061
Hey!

36:59.509 --> 37:00.737
Hurry up!

37:00.777 --> 37:02.938
Help!

37:03.013 --> 37:04.640
Get some help!

37:14.557 --> 37:16.149
Help!

37:30.173 --> 37:32.801
Well, l am officially in love
with this place.

37:32.842 --> 37:34.503
There's so much history here.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.672
Yeah. lt reminds me of my
grandma's house in Oregon.

37:37.714 --> 37:39.079
Do you smell smoke?

37:39.115 --> 37:42.312
Yeah.

37:49.259 --> 37:50.954
Oh, my God!

37:50.994 --> 37:52.325
The bathroom. Hurry.

38:08.478 --> 38:09.775
Hey, are you guys okay?

38:09.813 --> 38:10.939
Yeah. We're okay.

38:11.014 --> 38:12.675
She's still
a little shaken up.

38:12.716 --> 38:13.944
Has anybody seen Kelly?

38:14.050 --> 38:15.278
She took off a while ago.

38:15.318 --> 38:17.309
Steve, Ray is still in there
helping people out!

38:17.354 --> 38:18.582
Please make him come out.

38:18.621 --> 38:19.645
Stay here.
l'll find him.

38:19.689 --> 38:21.384
Please?
l'll find him.

38:23.126 --> 38:25.151
Run!

38:25.195 --> 38:27.322
Let go of me!

38:27.364 --> 38:29.332
l'm telling you, my girlfriend
is still inside!

38:29.366 --> 38:30.958
There's too much smoke.
You stay out here, all right?

38:31.000 --> 38:33.127
Alison is still inside!

38:33.169 --> 38:35.399
-Come on! Come on!
-Look, l'll make you a deal.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.928
You wait out here, and l'll go
find her, all right?

38:36.973 --> 38:38.304
lt's too dangerous.
We've gotta get out of here!

38:38.341 --> 38:40.332
The fire department will be here
any second. Let's go!

38:40.377 --> 38:42.242
l can't believe this, man.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.075
This is like right out
of a disaster movie.

38:44.114 --> 38:45.479
Yeah. There's going
to be hell to pay.

38:45.515 --> 38:46.482
lt's going to
cost a fortune!

38:46.516 --> 38:48.882
l'm going to go talk
to the firemen.

38:48.918 --> 38:51.819
All right, all right,
all right.

39:07.070 --> 39:08.833
Get the breathing
apparatus!

39:24.220 --> 39:25.744
l can't believe this
is happening!

39:25.789 --> 39:28.155
Listen, l was on the best
volunteer fire force in Oregon.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.158
lf we can find something

39:29.192 --> 39:31.752
to get wet, we can...

39:31.795 --> 39:34.525
Okay, this will keep the smoke
out until somebody comes.

39:34.564 --> 39:36.896
Take your sweater off
and help me.

39:36.933 --> 39:38.628
l can't!
l can't even think straight.

39:38.668 --> 39:39.794
Yes, you can.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.202
Hey, don't shut down
on me, all right?

39:42.238 --> 39:44.229
-Yeah.
-Listen. Breathe slowly.

39:44.274 --> 39:45.639
You have to stay calm.

39:45.675 --> 39:46.733
How can you stay calm

39:46.776 --> 39:48.505
when there's a fire
outside your door?

39:48.545 --> 39:49.512
There's nothing else
we can do.

39:49.546 --> 39:51.343
We just have to wait
till somebody comes.

39:51.381 --> 39:52.973
Who's going to come?
Nobody knows we're here.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.483
My girlfriend is out there.

39:54.517 --> 39:55.882
She won't let them forget
about us.

39:55.919 --> 40:00.151
My boyfriend didn't
even show up tonight.

40:02.058 --> 40:04.356
Well, Brandon, it's been really
good to see you again.

40:04.394 --> 40:05.725
Yeah. You, too.

40:05.762 --> 40:07.889
l hope San Diego
treats you well.

40:07.931 --> 40:11.560
l'm sure it will.

40:11.601 --> 40:15.128
Well, looks like this
is the end of the line.

40:15.171 --> 40:17.662
Then why don't
l feel like getting off?

40:17.707 --> 40:20.369
Yeah.

40:22.078 --> 40:24.342
Well...

40:24.380 --> 40:25.540
Bye, Brandon.

40:25.582 --> 40:27.311
Bye, Em.

40:28.818 --> 40:30.342
Brandon.

40:33.122 --> 40:35.249
l don't want to say good-bye.

40:35.291 --> 40:37.259
Neither do l.

40:42.999 --> 40:44.728
Then don't.

41:00.350 --> 41:02.614
Look at this house!

41:02.652 --> 41:03.846
Man, me and Griffin
are going

41:03.887 --> 41:05.445
to have some serious
explaining to do.

41:05.488 --> 41:06.955
Where is that bonehead?!

41:06.990 --> 41:08.617
l don't know, man,
he... he was...

41:08.658 --> 41:10.888
l just...
he was just...

41:13.496 --> 41:14.929
l've got the second hydrant.

41:14.964 --> 41:16.261
Guys, we need help over here.

41:16.299 --> 41:18.460
Second hydrant-- where is it?

41:20.069 --> 41:21.559
Did they find Alison?

41:21.604 --> 41:22.832
They're still looking.

41:22.872 --> 41:25.102
l'm just glad Kelly
got into that cab.

41:25.141 --> 41:27.336
That's not that blond girl,
is it?

41:27.377 --> 41:28.503
Why? Did you see her?

41:28.545 --> 41:32.345
lf it's the one l saw,
she didn't get in any cab.

41:32.382 --> 41:35.715
She was going
downstairs with Alison.

41:35.752 --> 41:37.811
Oh, God!

41:37.854 --> 41:38.821
We're going to die in here.

41:38.855 --> 41:40.720
No, we're not. Don't say that.

41:40.757 --> 41:43.658
My mom, my little sister--

41:43.693 --> 41:45.285
l didn't even see them tonight.

41:45.328 --> 41:49.025
The last time l talked to Dana,
we were fighting.

41:49.065 --> 41:52.967
Brandon doesn't even know
this is happening.

41:53.002 --> 41:56.199
Listen. l'm not giving up.

41:56.239 --> 41:58.935
But if this is it,

41:58.975 --> 42:02.911
l'm glad l'm not
going through this alone.

42:02.946 --> 42:05.210
Me, too.

42:15.692 --> 42:20.254
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

42:20.296 --> 42:22.992
hallowed be thy name.

42:23.066 --> 42:26.001
Say it with me, Kelly.

42:26.102 --> 42:30.300
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,

42:30.340 --> 42:32.399
on earth as it is in heaven.

42:36.045 --> 42:38.946
Hello! Anyone down there?

42:38.982 --> 42:40.745
Yes! We're down here!

42:40.783 --> 42:42.307
-Please hurry!
-Oh, my God!

42:42.352 --> 42:44.081
Please help us!

42:45.722 --> 42:47.656
Get close to the floor!

42:47.690 --> 42:51.456
We're trying to get to you!
Stay calm!
