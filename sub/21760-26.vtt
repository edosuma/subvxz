Yaaaa!

01:17.620 --> 01:20.330
I made the most
amazing discovery!

01:20.330 --> 01:23.040
I thought I already owned
all the oil in these parts,

01:23.040 --> 01:26.620
but according to my new
Dipstick 6,000 Crude Indicator,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.080
there's more oil under the swamp
than in the pores

01:29.080 --> 01:32.380
of the entire Grutely
High School graduation class.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.080
Oil that should be mine
because...

01:35.080 --> 01:36.420
well, because I want it.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.920
Ehh?

01:37.920 --> 01:39.580
And the swamp is the one place

01:39.580 --> 01:43.500
those mud-loving government
agencies won't let me drill.

01:50.250 --> 01:52.040
I need some way
to disguise

01:52.040 --> 01:54.710
a lot of big, noisy
drilling equipment.

01:54.710 --> 01:58.170
Something big
and noisy!

01:58.170 --> 02:00.920
(Cruella reads
advertisement out loud)

02:02.750 --> 02:06.120
Oh, yes!

02:09.290 --> 02:12.790
There I was, caught in the open,
defenseless,

02:12.790 --> 02:16.750
50 yellow-belly sapsuckers
dove at me from every angle!

02:16.750 --> 02:18.250
Zoom, zoom!

02:18.250 --> 02:21.540
I knocked them out of the air,
pow, bam!

02:21.540 --> 02:23.170
But they just kept coming!

02:24.540 --> 02:26.580
The first time
he told this story,

02:26.580 --> 02:28.920
there was only one
yellow-bellied sapsucker.

02:28.920 --> 02:32.670
Oh, girl, you know
how those wild birds
multiply.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.170
Child, I sure do.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.460
Finally,
I'd had enough
and I, I...

02:39.460 --> 02:41.670
Ran for the barn like
your tail was on fire.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.120
Right! And I...

02:43.120 --> 02:46.960
Hey! Who's telling
this story, anyway?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.920
Lucky, how can anyone
take you seriously

02:51.920 --> 02:53.620
the way you exaggerate?

02:53.620 --> 02:55.670
Now, if you want
to be believed,

02:55.670 --> 02:58.290
you have to learn
not to stretch the truth.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.080
Oh, Mom,
you told me that

03:00.080 --> 03:02.040
a million
gazillion times.

03:06.830 --> 03:08.880
Hey, everybody, look!

03:11.880 --> 03:16.540
Come, everyone,
to Cruella World!

03:16.540 --> 03:20.380
Where the world of fashion
meets the world of fun!

03:20.380 --> 03:22.830
From the Coupe-go-round...

03:23.830 --> 03:27.380
to the Pirates of the Cardigan!

03:28.540 --> 03:30.880
...to great moments
with Cruella de Vil.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.960
Ha ha ha ha ha!

03:37.500 --> 03:40.040
And the Electrical
Fashion Parade!

03:48.790 --> 03:51.880
Cruella World
will thrill you...

03:53.960 --> 03:54.790
Aaaah!

03:56.210 --> 03:58.040
fill you with delicacies,

03:58.040 --> 04:01.880
from pizza bonnets
to sardine sandals.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.880
Rolly: Yeah!

04:03.880 --> 04:07.540
Cruella: Cruella World
is conveniently located
next to the swamp.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.500
Leech repellant
recommended.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.880
Oh, man, it's the coolest
amusement park

04:11.880 --> 04:14.710
in the whole world,
and it's right next door.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.080
Whoa, papa!

04:16.080 --> 04:18.330
I'll bet the sidewalks are paved

04:18.330 --> 04:20.420
with yummy litter.

04:20.420 --> 04:24.790
Cruella World's a direct line
to the inner thrill seeker.

04:24.790 --> 04:28.250
Oh, yeah, combines
my two favorite things:

04:28.250 --> 04:30.170
terror and throwing up.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.420
Hey, can we go, Mom?

04:32.420 --> 04:33.710
Please!

04:33.710 --> 04:34.790
Pretty, pretty,

04:34.790 --> 04:36.750
pretty please!

04:36.750 --> 04:38.670
Sorry, kids, no.

04:38.670 --> 04:41.210
Cruella World looks
far too scary for pups.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.580
Nah!

04:44.580 --> 04:48.040
One time at the carnival,
I was on this roller coaster,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.670
and the cars flew off the track

04:50.670 --> 04:54.250
and everybody else was screaming
and afraid, but not me.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.420
I just held on with my teeth

04:56.420 --> 04:58.750
and steered it
back onto the tracks.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.460
-Oh, boy!
-Ohhh!

05:02.920 --> 05:05.710
But why do we have to
go to Cruella World?

05:05.710 --> 05:08.830
Because Cruella invited us
to the pre-opening party,

05:08.830 --> 05:11.380
and because she's my boss.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.120
Hey, look,
Lucky wants to go.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.290
Take him instead of me.

05:19.290 --> 05:21.500
Cruella will never know
the difference.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.330
Sorry, Lucky,
no dogs allowed.

05:25.330 --> 05:26.790
Only husbands.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.830
I tried, buddy.

05:49.380 --> 05:50.750
I don't get it.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.330
How come they won't let me go?

05:57.620 --> 05:58.670
Huh?!

05:58.670 --> 05:59.750
Hey!

06:06.960 --> 06:09.710
Whoo! That'll
polish right up.

06:09.710 --> 06:10.920
What's going on?

06:10.920 --> 06:13.040
Hey, you're just in time
for the big swamp meet.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.580
Everything goes,
including me.

06:15.580 --> 06:17.210
You wanna buy
an egg beater?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.000
Yaaaaa!

06:19.000 --> 06:22.080
I'll take that as a no.
Heh heh!

06:24.540 --> 06:25.710
Ptooey!

06:25.710 --> 06:28.080
What is this stuff?

06:28.080 --> 06:30.670
Oil, black gold,
Texas tea.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.830
Oil

06:34.830 --> 06:36.460
From there!

06:37.620 --> 06:39.120
Enough oil leaks
out of that pipe

06:39.120 --> 06:42.250
to grease a politician's
palm, hair, and limousine.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.000
It's making a mess
of everything.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.040
-Hey, lookie there.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.750
And that's just
the beginning.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.000
The stuff's spreading.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.710
Today the swamp,
tomorrow your farm...

07:13.420 --> 07:15.790
then the world!

07:17.040 --> 07:19.540
Who put this thing here anyway?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.830
Who knows?

07:21.830 --> 07:23.540
Ohhh, boy!

07:27.500 --> 07:31.290
Hey, wanna buy
an electric nose nibbler?

07:51.580 --> 07:53.330
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:53.330 --> 07:56.420
investors and merchandizers,

07:56.420 --> 07:57.920
Cruella World
is now open

07:57.920 --> 08:02.670
for its gala
pre-opening
opening celebration!

08:14.250 --> 08:16.830
Welcome to Ye Olde
Boutique Street,

08:16.830 --> 08:19.540
where you can shoppe
till you droppe.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.380
Well, we've been
to Cruella World.

08:23.380 --> 08:26.080
Now I can die happy.
Let's go.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.580
Okay, what do you want
to see first, darling?

08:28.580 --> 08:31.830
Ah, Ascot Center,
the Haunted Blouse.

08:31.830 --> 08:34.620
Or the Country
Underwear Jamboree.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.580
Just shoot me.

08:45.080 --> 08:49.880
Whoa! It's even more spectacular
than I imagined.

08:56.830 --> 09:00.080
Ehh! Smells like oil.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.080
Oil pipes!

09:16.080 --> 09:18.170
Miles and miles of them!

09:20.210 --> 09:23.750
This place could suck up
all the oil in the universe.

09:23.750 --> 09:27.460
Ehh, wait till the others
hear about this!

09:38.460 --> 09:41.290
Wake up, guys.
I need your help.

09:41.290 --> 09:46.080
You're gonna need a vet
if you break my REM sleep again.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.880
Lucky: I'm serious!
We have a mission.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.460
Saving the barnyard
from killer sapsuckers?

09:53.540 --> 09:55.830
No! Ugggh!

09:55.830 --> 09:57.540
Saving the world!

09:57.540 --> 10:00.620
Can't we save it
after breakfast?

10:00.620 --> 10:03.830
Guys! Cruella World
is really just a front

10:03.830 --> 10:06.120
for a big
oil-drilling operation,

10:06.120 --> 10:09.040
and if we don't do something,
it's gonna spoil the swamp

10:09.040 --> 10:12.420
and the farm and the universe
and everything!

10:12.420 --> 10:15.330
Ah, the flood gates
of fantasy

10:15.330 --> 10:17.040
are open
once again.

10:18.580 --> 10:21.580
No. This time I'm not
making it up.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.790
I saw it myself.

10:23.790 --> 10:28.120
Big pipes and-- and
huge machines and...

10:28.120 --> 10:30.000
Oh, puh-leeze!

10:30.000 --> 10:31.290
Uh-huh.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.500
Yeah, pull the other one.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.210
Fine.

10:35.210 --> 10:38.540
If you guys don't
believe me,
I'll just get

10:38.540 --> 10:40.040
somebody else
to help me.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.710
Yeah, almost.
A little lower.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.080
Oh, that's it
right there. Yeah!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.420
Yeah, yeah!

10:48.420 --> 10:50.790
Colonel! Colonel!

10:50.790 --> 10:54.420
You have to call out
the Bark Brigade for
an important mission.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.960
What, a mitten?

10:55.960 --> 10:58.920
What's so important
about a mitten?

10:58.920 --> 11:02.460
Not mitten, mission!

11:02.460 --> 11:05.380
And so I came here
as fast as I could.

11:05.380 --> 11:08.330
Sergeant Tibbs,
what have you heard
about this?

11:08.330 --> 11:11.330
Nothing's reached my ears,
Colonel, sir.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.420
Nice try, Lucky, but you'll
have to talk someone else

11:14.420 --> 11:16.420
into taking you
to Cruella World.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.790
But it's true!

11:18.790 --> 11:22.380
Now, go on, shoo!
I have to trim the hair
in the Colonel's ears.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.460
A bear with internal gears?
Whereabouts?

11:26.790 --> 11:28.170
You see?

11:28.170 --> 11:30.380
But... But...

11:30.380 --> 11:33.290
Oh!
What's the use?

11:36.460 --> 11:39.170
Maybe mom was right.

11:39.170 --> 11:41.620
I exaggerated
so much before...

11:43.420 --> 11:45.080
Fine! I'll just have to

11:45.080 --> 11:47.170
shut down
Cruella World myself.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.750
There must be a way
to stop this thing.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.500
Hurry up,
the Electrical Fashion Parade

12:01.500 --> 12:03.000
starts in five minutes!

12:05.880 --> 12:07.540
Whoa!

12:16.250 --> 12:19.500
Jasper, look, the puppy's
gonna break the pump!

12:19.500 --> 12:21.290
Stop him!

12:29.540 --> 12:30.790
Yaaaaa!

12:37.830 --> 12:40.380
You busted my bulbs.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.000
He's at it again!

12:43.040 --> 12:44.210
Get him!

12:46.250 --> 12:48.080
Get away from there!

13:01.000 --> 13:02.580
Yaaah!

13:13.420 --> 13:14.500
Gotcha!

13:16.040 --> 13:18.790
Whaaaaa!

13:23.210 --> 13:24.420
Yaaa!

13:29.250 --> 13:31.330
Jasper: Get that dog!

13:43.460 --> 13:45.040
Huh?

13:50.580 --> 13:51.620
Whew!

13:51.620 --> 13:53.670
Gotcha!

14:04.380 --> 14:07.210
The old stomach alarm
says it's dinnertime.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.880
Spot!

14:15.500 --> 14:16.750
-Oooh!

14:16.750 --> 14:18.080
Aaaaah!

14:19.290 --> 14:23.250
Call the Colonel.
I'm fried.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.420
Go back to the swamp,
gator butt,

14:29.420 --> 14:32.460
and take your
primitive reptilian
instincts with ya!

14:32.460 --> 14:34.790
Hey, you think we like

14:34.790 --> 14:37.120
this muckless wasteland?

14:37.120 --> 14:40.790
Somebody's turned the swamp
into an oil pit.

14:40.790 --> 14:43.880
We had to come here
for a home-plucked meal.

14:45.170 --> 14:49.330
Oh, man, Lucky was...
he was...

14:49.330 --> 14:51.080
both:
telling the truth!

14:55.960 --> 14:59.460
My stomach alarm says
we're going to be late
for dinner.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.830
Well, you'll just
have to reset it.

15:01.830 --> 15:05.620
We have to help
Lucky shut down
Cruella World!

15:05.620 --> 15:10.120
Spot: Yeah, before we're all
turned into alligator kibble!

15:11.620 --> 15:14.170
It's the security
office for you,

15:14.170 --> 15:15.330
you little
sabotager.

15:16.620 --> 15:18.210
Jasper, did you get him?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.210
Ohhh!

15:27.080 --> 15:28.120
Huh?

15:32.830 --> 15:36.080
And never wear a plaid suit
to a funeral.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.880
Wear socks with sandals only
when impersonating your father.

15:40.880 --> 15:46.120
Banana peels must be fresh
if used as an accessory

15:46.120 --> 15:48.580
and are not recommended
for summer wear.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.460
Never wear yellow
to a cheese party.

15:51.460 --> 15:52.920
You'll clash...

15:52.920 --> 15:55.580
Jasper: He's in here somewhere,
I can feel it in my bones.

15:57.380 --> 16:00.830
Always remove your hat
before dusting it.

16:05.620 --> 16:06.710
Uggh!

16:06.710 --> 16:11.000
(laughing
hysterically)

16:27.500 --> 16:30.080
I got him, Jasper!

16:51.670 --> 16:53.710
Sorry that we didn't
believe you, Luck.

16:53.710 --> 16:57.920
It's my own fault for
exaggerating so much.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.460
Come on!

17:03.080 --> 17:06.080
Lucky: Let's take
Cruella World for a spin.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.170
You know what to do.

17:08.170 --> 17:10.170
Jasper:
There they are!

17:15.080 --> 17:16.540
Why, ya dirty --

17:25.750 --> 17:27.210
Aaaaah!

17:37.880 --> 17:39.250
Nyah nyah!

17:39.250 --> 17:40.830
Why, you little...

17:55.920 --> 17:58.080
Dresses are out.

17:58.080 --> 18:01.750
You must accessorize.
You must accessorize!

18:01.750 --> 18:04.790
Now I've gotcha.

18:07.830 --> 18:09.920
You must accessorize.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.290
Acc-acc-acc-accessorize

18:12.290 --> 18:14.000
or d-d-d-die!

18:16.000 --> 18:16.920
Waaaah!

18:16.920 --> 18:19.920
Accessorize or die!

18:21.170 --> 18:22.420
Get out!

18:33.080 --> 18:36.750
Hey, Jasper,
what's "turbo" mean?

18:39.040 --> 18:39.880
Trouble!

18:41.750 --> 18:44.460
Everybody out before she blows!

18:54.920 --> 19:00.000
And that's what makes
Cruella World fun
for the whole family!

19:03.460 --> 19:04.750
What?!

19:04.750 --> 19:07.000
woman:
Oh, what's going on?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.540
Accessorize or die!

19:08.540 --> 19:09.580
Aaaaaaah!

19:09.580 --> 19:10.830
Ohhhh!

19:10.830 --> 19:13.080
Accessorize or die!

19:13.080 --> 19:14.880
Ohhhhh.

19:17.380 --> 19:19.040
Crowd:
Whoa!

19:22.330 --> 19:25.000
Oh, my goodness!

19:30.920 --> 19:31.920
Whoaaa!

19:39.290 --> 19:40.420
Whew!

19:40.420 --> 19:42.500
Accessorize or die!

19:43.620 --> 19:45.380
Accessorize or die!

19:46.500 --> 19:47.540
Whoa!

19:53.290 --> 19:54.580
Huh?

20:00.880 --> 20:02.710
Where are you all going?

20:02.710 --> 20:05.290
It's just a little greasy,
combustible,

20:05.290 --> 20:07.670
generally liquid substance!

20:11.380 --> 20:12.580
You!

20:23.670 --> 20:24.920
Huh?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.540
Now, that is a ride!

20:31.670 --> 20:32.710
Ahem.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.380
What?

20:37.380 --> 20:39.790
We found that leak there,
Miss De Vile.

20:39.790 --> 20:40.880
Leak?

20:40.880 --> 20:42.580
Yep, out at the swamp.

20:42.580 --> 20:43.830
Oil was leaking out
of your pipelines.

20:43.830 --> 20:45.500
But we plugged her up,
not to worry.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.620
Looks like you've got
another problem, though.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.790
Do you mean that
I've been stealing oil

20:49.790 --> 20:51.790
out of my own
pipeline?!

20:51.790 --> 20:53.920
Uh-huh.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.620
Man on TV: And that was
the scene earlier today

20:59.620 --> 21:01.500
as Cruella De Vil was charged

21:01.500 --> 21:04.080
with polluting
a major preserve.

21:04.080 --> 21:08.040
She was fined and ordered to
clean up the swamp personally.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.880
Uggh!

21:18.170 --> 21:22.710
I promise to believe
everything that you say
from now on, Lucky.

21:22.710 --> 21:26.540
And I promise
no more tall tales.

21:39.580 --> 21:40.670
Huh?

21:54.670 --> 21:56.960
R-Rolly! Rolly!

21:56.960 --> 21:58.830
Hey, Cadpig!

22:01.000 --> 22:05.040
Aw, they wouldn't have
believed me, anyway.
