01:34.767 --> 01:37.533
- Well, what are
you waiting for?

01:39.567 --> 01:40.400
Kill me!

01:43.533 --> 01:44.367
Kill me.

01:57.433 --> 01:58.600
I thought you were dead.

01:58.600 --> 01:59.900
- I don't go down that easy.

01:59.900 --> 02:00.933
Where are the others?

02:01.867 --> 02:03.400
Are you sure?

02:03.400 --> 02:05.567
- Lizzie might have
made to the road?

02:05.567 --> 02:07.067
I just don't know.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.400
- It's a mess this
is turning out to be.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.333
- I found the car.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.400
Let me help you.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.233
We can make it.

02:36.067 --> 02:37.633
She didn't start earlier.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.067
- She floods real easily.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.333
Go gentle on the gas pedal.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.200
Now, let's get the
hell outta here.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.267
- Amen to that.

02:52.133 --> 02:55.133
- It's a good thing you
stumbled across the vehicle.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.700
- It was hidden pretty well.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.633
We wouldn't ever seen it from
the main road where we parked.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.800
- Who would've known
clowns can drive cars?

03:02.967 --> 03:05.100
- I guess Lizzie's
intuition was right.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.700
It just seems like it
hasn't actually happened.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.433
- This is so surreal.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.200
- What do we do now?

03:11.200 --> 03:14.067
- Call the police, get them
up here to clean this mess up.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.367
- This is just more
than just a mess.

03:15.367 --> 03:17.167
This is a nightmare.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.067
- We should just be
happy we're alive.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.600
- You,
hold it right there!

06:40.700 --> 06:42.733
- Welcome back
to Live News Channel 7.

06:42.733 --> 06:44.200
We just received
word that police

06:44.200 --> 06:47.067
are closing in on the
notorious Camp Blood killer,

06:47.067 --> 06:49.900
identified by authorities
as Stan Cunningham.

06:49.900 --> 06:53.400
He's believed to have been
responsible for over 27 murders

06:53.400 --> 06:54.700
in the last decade.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.967
Targeting victims in
the Blackwood area.

06:56.967 --> 07:00.200
His motives were unknown
but a countrywide crackdown

07:00.200 --> 07:02.400
led authorities to him
home where a search

07:02.400 --> 07:04.567
uncovered dozens
of murder weapons,

07:04.567 --> 07:07.900
photos of victims and
several clown masks.

07:07.900 --> 07:11.267
Locals are relieved but still
frightened by terror legacy.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.333
- I can't believe it, I
really can't believe it.

07:15.333 --> 07:17.900
I've known Stan
Cunningham all my life.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.767
The guy was just, I
don't know, normal guy,

07:20.767 --> 07:25.200
your average guy, nice guy,
quiet, kept to himself.

07:25.200 --> 07:29.833
I can't believe that he would
murder all those people.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.233
When I heard the news,
I was just shocked.

07:32.233 --> 07:33.767
Really shocking.

07:33.767 --> 07:36.500
- I really don't wanna talk
wanna talk about this, okay?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.567
Just leave me alone.

07:39.800 --> 07:40.600
Did you hear what I said?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.067
Leave me alone.

07:42.067 --> 07:45.167
- To let these kind of sick
people walk the streets without,

07:45.167 --> 07:48.400
you know, the proper healthcare
or mental healthcare or,

07:48.400 --> 07:49.833
it's just, it's scary.

07:49.833 --> 07:52.900
I mean, you know, I.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.367
- We have been told

07:54.367 --> 07:55.967
that the fugitive killer have
been cornered in an alley.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.967
And he's now in a
showdown with the police.

07:57.967 --> 08:00.067
More breaking news
as we receive it.

08:02.567 --> 08:04.067
- Freeze!

15:42.133 --> 15:45.400
- Well, Randy, I
have some bad news.

15:45.400 --> 15:49.333
Your show, Voice from Beyond,
is tanking in the ratings.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.900
Our sponsors are pulling out

15:50.900 --> 15:53.167
and move in to the
home and garden hour.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.233
- What?

15:54.233 --> 15:55.233
You're joking.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.267
- I wish I was.

15:56.267 --> 15:58.233
Look at these ratings.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.300
It's really bad.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.767
- Look, I know we've
had a few bad months.

16:02.767 --> 16:04.300
The Halloween is coming.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.100
It'll pick up.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.400
It always does.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.900
- Not good enough.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.733
We need the time slot for
program that makes us money.

16:10.733 --> 16:14.200
Two years, I've held
on and we keep sinking.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.767
I have to cut it.

16:15.767 --> 16:16.967
You understand.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.333
- No, I don't.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.933
- Let me put it to you this way.

16:19.933 --> 16:21.167
Your show is over.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.067
Done.

16:22.067 --> 16:23.800
Do you understand that?

16:23.800 --> 16:25.300
- People love this crap.

16:25.300 --> 16:26.600
- No on our station.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.733
There's too many
competitive programs.

16:28.733 --> 16:29.867
Better ones.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.100
We tried.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.967
- Give me one more
chance, please.

16:32.967 --> 16:34.300
- No can do.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.700
I got the barking orders
from the head office.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.900
- My contract says you
owe me six more shows.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.733
- We both know what
contracts are worth.

16:42.733 --> 16:45.967
- I guess I'll have to take my
hot new concept to WGFN then.

16:45.967 --> 16:48.200
- Yeah, and what is that?

16:48.200 --> 16:50.233
- A program on the
Camp Blood killer.

16:50.233 --> 16:51.867
Stan Cunningham.

16:53.233 --> 16:54.367
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:54.367 --> 16:55.333
Hold it.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.167
That's hot!

16:56.167 --> 16:57.367
Real hot!

16:57.367 --> 16:58.600
And trendy.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.467
- Yeah, well, someone
else is getting it.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.667
I'm done, remember?

17:01.667 --> 17:03.067
- Let's back up a bit.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.733
What if we work out a deal?

17:04.733 --> 17:07.200
- What good is a deal if a
contract can't be upheld?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.233
- I'm serious.

17:08.233 --> 17:10.267
Listen, I'll talk to the brass

17:10.267 --> 17:12.599
and hold off on
this garden program.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.500
You deliver me a knockout
show about Camp Blood

17:15.500 --> 17:18.233
and we might be able to get
you extended for a year,

17:18.233 --> 17:20.300
and a better time slot.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.400
- Yeah?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.666
- Yeah, trust me.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.233
- That's the part I don't like.

17:26.133 --> 17:26.967
- Well?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.400
- Deal.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.967
- Don't let me down.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.133
- And don't worry.

17:32.133 --> 17:34.900
This one's gonna
blow the others away.

18:20.467 --> 18:24.600
Stan Cunningham a.k.a.
the Camp Blood Killer.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.333
Reportedly to have
slain over 27 people.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.800
All in the vicinity
of Camp Blackwood,

18:30.800 --> 18:32.500
known by locals as Camp Blood.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.200
And now, infamous area,
off limits to anyone.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.800
No one knows what drove him
to commit these murders.

18:42.967 --> 18:45.067
Some say a jealous rage
over a scorned lover.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.400
Other boil it down
to a mad blood lust,

18:48.400 --> 18:51.100
unchecked and out of control.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.100
He's weapon of choice were
various long-bladed machetes.

18:55.533 --> 18:56.700
Sometimes, an ax.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.600
Sometimes, his bare hands.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.467
Each murder was
bloody and vicious.

19:10.233 --> 19:13.533
Several clues and tips
led authorities to Stan

19:13.533 --> 19:16.433
who was gunned down
in a dark alley.

19:17.933 --> 19:19.433
Even to the end, it is said
he brandished his machete.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.567
No one knows where
his body is buried.

19:29.433 --> 19:31.900
Well, my friend, you're
gonna make history again.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.100
Now, it's gonna be of
no harm in this world.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.567
We'll see what you can tell
us from the other side.

20:18.100 --> 20:19.133
11 o'clock?

20:20.033 --> 20:21.167
I must really slept in.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.167
Yeah, what is it?

20:30.167 --> 20:31.600
How can I help you?

20:31.600 --> 20:32.533
- Hi, Mr. Banks.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.367
I'm AJ and this is Jane and Sam.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.333
- Hello.

20:35.333 --> 20:37.100
- We're huge fans of your show.

20:37.100 --> 20:38.233
- Yeah, that's a shocker.

20:38.233 --> 20:40.000
Look, I don't have a pen on me

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
if you're booking for an
autograph or something.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.800
- No, we wanna help you.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.367
- Help me?

20:45.367 --> 20:47.467
Wait, you're that local community
college paranormal group,

20:47.467 --> 20:48.600
aren't you?

20:48.600 --> 20:49.833
- That's us.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.133
We'd really like
to be on your show.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.733
Nobody takes us seriously.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.300
- Yeah, I know
the feeling, kids,

20:55.300 --> 20:57.367
but I already have my next
few months' shows planned

20:57.367 --> 21:00.400
so maybe in a few months or so?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.800
- We're also willing to
assist you on your ghost hunts

21:02.800 --> 21:04.200
free of charge.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.167
- Are you sure you
have the nerve.

21:06.167 --> 21:07.700
- Yeah, why?

21:07.700 --> 21:08.967
- Really?

21:08.967 --> 21:10.900
Have you ever felt the
hot breath of a specter

21:10.900 --> 21:12.167
on the back of your neck?

21:13.333 --> 21:15.600
The cold touch of
death on your hand?

21:15.600 --> 21:18.967
Been thrown across the room
and bitten by unseen spirits?

21:18.967 --> 21:20.633
- Um, no.

21:20.633 --> 21:22.167
- Yeah, I thought so.

21:22.167 --> 21:24.467
- We talked to the ghost of a
five-year-old drowning victim.

21:24.467 --> 21:26.067
Does that count?

21:26.067 --> 21:26.900
- No.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.600
- Well, here's our card.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.967
Let's chat and
work something out.

21:29.967 --> 21:30.800
- Okay, thanks.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.633
I'll keep you guys in mind.

21:33.633 --> 21:34.467
Happy hunting.

21:37.067 --> 21:38.067
- He's interested.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.600
- Definitely.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.467
- Why don't we have as
exciting encounters as he does?

21:42.467 --> 21:43.733
- He's making half of it up.

21:43.733 --> 21:44.567
Come on.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.933
- If I can't find
you with my eyes,

22:03.933 --> 22:05.367
I got ways of finding you.

22:09.433 --> 22:10.333
Let's see here.

24:34.400 --> 24:36.633
- Should we be doing
this behind Randy's back?

24:36.633 --> 24:38.367
I mean, if he finds out,

24:38.367 --> 24:40.600
we're definitely not
gonna be on his show.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.067
- You worry too much.

24:42.067 --> 24:43.967
Like he owns this property.

24:43.967 --> 24:46.300
We have just as much right
to be here as he does.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.133
- Or anyone else
for that matter.

24:48.133 --> 24:49.900
- What do you hope to find?

24:49.900 --> 24:52.767
- Just some groovy B-roll
he can use for his show.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.300
Have you seen one of those?

24:54.300 --> 24:56.867
He's needs all the
help he can get.

24:56.867 --> 24:58.367
- If I'm correct,
I think we can find

24:58.367 --> 25:00.467
what's up with Camp
Blackwood back to us, right?

25:00.467 --> 25:01.933
- You mean Camp Blood?

25:03.900 --> 25:04.900
- Well, let's just go.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.500
I don't wanna be
here after dark.

25:23.167 --> 25:24.600
- Oh boy, we're close.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.100
Look!

25:26.100 --> 25:28.100
- Look, everyone in TV land,
the official Camp Blood sign.

25:28.100 --> 25:29.700
All yours for only 9.99.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.567
Plus shipping and handling.

25:30.567 --> 25:32.833
- Quit screwing around!

25:32.833 --> 25:33.700
- What's wrong, Jane?

25:33.700 --> 25:35.600
Getting scared on us?

25:35.600 --> 25:38.667
- Stop talking about things
you don't understand.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.133
- I don't think Stan
Cunningham cares.

25:40.133 --> 25:41.367
He's dead.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.167
- How do you know he's
spirit isn't alive?

25:43.167 --> 25:45.433
I've been feeling like
somebody's been watching us

25:45.433 --> 25:47.467
this whole entire time.

25:47.467 --> 25:48.900
- You worry too much.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.267
We found it, viewers!

25:50.267 --> 25:51.433
Camp Blood!

25:51.433 --> 25:53.167
This place is in ruins.

25:53.167 --> 25:55.600
Everything in ruins!

25:55.600 --> 25:57.167
This place is overgrown.

25:57.167 --> 25:59.567
It reeks of murder and death!

26:03.067 --> 26:05.400
- Looks like
someone's blood here.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.867
- Probably
everywhere here.

26:06.867 --> 26:09.767
You really think it was one
of the killer's victims?

26:09.767 --> 26:11.633
- I bet 10 bucks on it.

26:11.633 --> 26:15.567
Most murders occur here
at the surrounding place.

26:15.567 --> 26:18.267
- Suddenly, it doesn't
seem so cool being here.

26:18.267 --> 26:19.100
Let's split.

26:19.100 --> 26:20.300
We have enough footage.

29:31.067 --> 29:34.600
- Okay, promo of Stan
Cunningham, Camp Blood Killer.

29:47.067 --> 29:50.300

the Camp Blood killer.

29:51.267 --> 29:53.100
Yes, you heard correctly.

29:54.233 --> 29:55.800
We will talk to
the infamous killer

29:55.800 --> 29:59.300
to see if we can get answers
from his twisted mind.

29:59.300 --> 30:01.533
And even get answers
about many of his victims

30:01.533 --> 30:03.400
still missing and
unaccounted for.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.000
Join us for the most
important hour of the year.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.733
Randy Spark's
Voices From Beyond.

30:11.933 --> 30:14.100
- We'll all start
with my friend, AJ.

30:14.100 --> 30:19.100
He had this idea of our
adventures, ghost hunting,

30:19.900 --> 30:21.367
paranormal activity.

30:21.367 --> 30:25.600
We met in college and
he's a really cool guy.

30:25.600 --> 30:28.600
And then, our friend,
Jane, came along

30:28.600 --> 30:32.300
and she seem pretty
down for, you know,

30:32.300 --> 30:35.167
not like super like into it

30:35.167 --> 30:38.233
but she enjoy hanging out
with us 'cause, you know,

30:38.233 --> 30:39.833
cool people like that.

30:39.833 --> 30:41.433
And we've been all over.

30:41.433 --> 30:46.367
We traveled and we've seen
things and heard things.

30:46.367 --> 30:48.367
I'd like to say we're
pretty good at this.

30:48.367 --> 30:51.067
We talked to a five-year-old
drowning victim

30:51.067 --> 30:56.000
and he just really need
to reach out to us.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.767
He's wasn't sure
how to cross over

30:57.767 --> 30:59.533
and I'd like to
think we helped him.

30:59.533 --> 31:01.700
Stan Cunningham character is,

31:01.700 --> 31:05.433
yeah, he seems all
right, I guess.

31:05.433 --> 31:08.233
Killing people but,
you know, whatever.

31:23.067 --> 31:24.467
Not too scared of that.

31:24.467 --> 31:26.767
You know, he's like
any other spirit

31:26.767 --> 31:29.433
where I just needs to reach out.

31:54.600 --> 31:56.300
Where he just needs
to cross over.

32:18.100 --> 32:23.100
Hopefully, AJ, Jane, Randy and
I can help him do just that.

32:41.867 --> 32:43.467
- What do you want?

33:24.433 --> 33:25.600
I'll find you.

37:18.733 --> 37:21.433
- Next week's edition

treat stored for you.

37:26.067 --> 37:27.367
We have an exclusive date

37:27.367 --> 37:31.200
with Stan Cunningham,
the Camp Blood killer.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.267
Yes, you heard correctly.

37:34.267 --> 37:36.067
We will talk to
the infamous killer

37:36.067 --> 37:39.633
to see if we can get answers
from his twisted mind.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.800
And even get answers
about many of his victims

37:41.800 --> 37:43.700
still missing and
unaccounted for.

37:43.700 --> 37:47.300
Join us for the most
important hour of the year.

37:47.300 --> 37:50.133
Randy Spark's
Voices From Beyond.

37:51.167 --> 37:53.400
- Oh god, he does need our help.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.967
- Ooh, let's play a game.

37:54.967 --> 37:55.900
- Oh, brother.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.400
- Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.833
- Okay, what?

37:59.833 --> 38:04.067
- What is the grizzliest Camp
Blood murder that you know of?

38:04.067 --> 38:04.900
- Good one.

38:04.900 --> 38:05.733
Who goes first?

38:05.733 --> 38:08.367
- Okay, I will.

38:08.367 --> 38:09.267
Hmm.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.067
Let's see.

38:12.067 --> 38:13.700
- So many to choose from.

38:13.700 --> 38:18.067
- I think one of the
gruesomest Camp Blood murders

38:18.067 --> 38:21.300
would have to be that of the
victim that was strangled

38:21.300 --> 38:22.967
with her own intestines.

38:22.967 --> 38:23.800
- Really?

38:23.800 --> 38:24.633
Gross!

38:35.233 --> 38:37.900
- Good one but I think
it have to be one,

38:37.900 --> 38:39.300
it have to be the
wheelchair bound victim

38:39.300 --> 38:41.733
stabbed in the head
and slashed to pieces.

38:56.433 --> 38:58.367
- Mine is more savage.

38:58.367 --> 39:00.333
The one with the
hunter is killed

39:00.333 --> 39:02.933
with a road flare
right in his face!

39:08.333 --> 39:10.067
Ugh, gruesome!

39:10.067 --> 39:14.467
- Why do you think Stan Cunningham
killed all those people?

39:14.467 --> 39:16.600
- If only he really
knows for sure.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.533
So we contact the spirit?

39:18.533 --> 39:20.133
We'll find out.

39:20.133 --> 39:22.933
- Do you think he can still
kill beyond the grave?

39:22.933 --> 39:24.333
- Sounds like a cheap movie.

39:25.967 --> 39:27.867
- Seriously?

39:27.867 --> 39:30.633
- Anything is
possible, I suppose.

39:30.633 --> 39:34.400
I've heard of poltergeist
harming people.

39:34.400 --> 39:38.100
Biting and scratching
but never any deaths.

39:38.100 --> 39:41.067
- It would take a lot
of energy, a lot of hate

39:41.067 --> 39:44.567
to physically harm
somebody from the grave.

39:44.567 --> 39:46.500
- Let's hope we're not
the first to find out.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.600
I'm gonna give Randy Bucks a
call and see we're in or out

39:48.600 --> 39:49.733
regards to his show.

39:54.467 --> 39:55.667
Hey Randy, it's AJ.

39:55.667 --> 39:57.567
I wanna call, it's
Ghost Hunters.

39:57.567 --> 40:00.033
I phoned up with agency see
if we can help in your show.

40:00.033 --> 40:02.633
We filmed some rad B-roll
footage of Camp Blood today

40:02.633 --> 40:03.633
and found the sign.

40:05.567 --> 40:06.600
Sure do.

40:06.600 --> 40:07.433
Thank you so much.

40:07.433 --> 40:08.267
See you tomorrow.

40:10.033 --> 40:10.867
We're in.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.367
- Ooh, awesome.

40:12.367 --> 40:14.433
- It's fantastic!

40:14.433 --> 40:16.633
He sure did have
a change of heart.

40:16.633 --> 40:19.200
- He knows raw talent
when he sees it.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.700
- Or just a couple of suckers.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.800
- Yeah, this is Harley.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.400
No, I have the money for you.

40:45.400 --> 40:48.433
I just scored a
job that paid well.

40:48.433 --> 40:51.067
Tell him first he
still get what I owe.

40:51.067 --> 40:52.767
Nothing more.

40:52.767 --> 40:55.167
He's getting real greedy.

40:55.167 --> 40:59.333
Yeah, same place, phone
boot by first and fifth.

40:59.333 --> 41:00.500
Later.

41:22.267 --> 41:25.500
It's time I find an
honest profession.

41:31.667 --> 41:33.367
Who the hell are you?

41:33.367 --> 41:34.800
You know, you're trespassing.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.300
Hey, I stole that
mask for Randy Banks.

41:41.300 --> 41:42.100
Who are you?

41:44.500 --> 41:48.200
Banks, if you're here to get
your money back, beat it.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.667
A deal is a deal.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.400
Okay, funny guy.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.833
I hope you have clown insurance.

41:57.800 --> 41:58.833
No, no!

42:13.433 --> 42:14.867
- We're at your disposal.

42:14.867 --> 42:17.900
- Thanks so much for the
opportunity to work with you.

42:17.900 --> 42:20.067
- I'm a damn good camera person.

42:20.067 --> 42:21.367
- Great.

42:21.367 --> 42:22.900
I think we'll work
well together.

42:22.900 --> 42:25.467
It's all well and good as
long you have a fortitude.

42:25.467 --> 42:26.700
- We can handle it.

42:26.700 --> 42:27.800
We've seen all kinds of
paranormal activities

42:27.800 --> 42:29.533
that would turn a ghost white.

42:29.533 --> 42:30.733
- You've never
dealt with a spirit

42:30.733 --> 42:33.600
of a homicidal maniac
before, have you?

42:33.600 --> 42:34.400
- Well, no.

42:35.367 --> 42:36.567
Not exactly.

42:36.567 --> 42:38.533
- Stan Cunningham,
the Camp Blood killer

42:38.533 --> 42:41.200
is serious business.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.600
When we make contact with him,

42:42.600 --> 42:45.533
he may try and lash
out to harm one of us.

42:45.533 --> 42:49.100
- We've all been poked and
prodded by ghost before.

42:49.100 --> 42:50.533
- I'm talking more than that.

42:50.533 --> 42:52.633
Physical harm is reality.

42:52.633 --> 42:53.900
Strangling.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.700
He may try to throw an
object at you, stab you.

42:56.700 --> 42:57.833
Do you see what I mean?

42:59.600 --> 43:00.467
You still in?

43:05.167 --> 43:07.200
- Do we have anything physical

43:07.200 --> 43:09.800
that we contact the spirit with?

43:09.800 --> 43:10.633
- We sure do.

43:14.233 --> 43:15.800
- My god, is that?

43:15.800 --> 43:18.500
- The killer's actual mask, yes.

43:21.300 --> 43:22.900
- How did you?

43:22.900 --> 43:24.500
- Don't worry
about how I got it.

43:24.500 --> 43:27.800
Point is I have it and this
will be our strongest link

43:27.800 --> 43:29.500
between our world and his.

43:31.667 --> 43:32.600
- It's creepy.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.300
Can you guy's feel it?

43:34.300 --> 43:38.200
It's almost as if it's
emitting some sort of energy.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.467
- Those are some bad vibes, man.

43:40.467 --> 43:42.833
- Other than the actual
murder weapons themselves,

43:42.833 --> 43:44.433
this right here is
the strongest tie

43:44.433 --> 43:47.300
between Stan Cunningham
and his sick twisted world.

43:48.633 --> 43:49.533
- What's the plan?

43:58.533 --> 44:01.200
- I have it on good authority
that tan Cunningham's body

44:01.200 --> 44:02.933
is buried in a remote location

44:02.933 --> 44:04.967
near the vicinity of Camp Blood.

44:04.967 --> 44:07.700
- We're all over the place
and we didn't see it.

44:07.700 --> 44:10.167
- Then you didn't
look hard enough, kid.

44:10.167 --> 44:11.500
- Okay, okay.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.733
- Once we find it, then what?

44:13.733 --> 44:15.800
- Cecil B. DeMille
here will film.

44:15.800 --> 44:18.100
We'll make contact and
capture the whole event.

44:18.100 --> 44:20.067
We'll set his spirit free.

44:20.067 --> 44:21.567
The mask being the link.

44:21.567 --> 44:23.300
Then we'll bury it next to him.

44:23.300 --> 44:25.633
The bloody legacy, closed.

44:25.633 --> 44:26.800
- What if he doesn't wanna go?

44:26.800 --> 44:28.067
- Why wouldn't he?

44:28.067 --> 44:30.067
- He was going to a
place he'd be welcome.

44:30.067 --> 44:31.700
Would you rather
stick around here?

44:31.700 --> 44:33.233
- Good observation.

44:33.233 --> 44:35.800
But we'll do our best to
convince him that it's over.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.200
- When do we start?

44:37.200 --> 44:39.067
- Right now, today.

44:57.400 --> 45:00.100
- How far back this
Camp Blood would go?

45:00.100 --> 45:01.433
When was it open?

45:01.433 --> 45:03.300
- I think it started
as summer kids' retreat

45:03.300 --> 45:04.667
back in the 60s.

45:04.667 --> 45:07.100
- Yeah, that's right, 1968.

45:07.100 --> 45:09.833
- I guess today's summer
camps are a thing of the past.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.267
- This one sure is.

45:11.267 --> 45:13.667
- Now, I went to some
camps a few times as a kid.

45:13.667 --> 45:15.300
- Yeah, did you like it?

45:15.300 --> 45:16.133
- Yeah, it's all right.

45:16.133 --> 45:17.433
Fun, actually.

45:17.433 --> 45:20.567
- Did you tell
scary ghost stories?

45:20.567 --> 45:22.367
- Yeah, among other things.

45:22.367 --> 45:24.400
- What urban legends
are popular in your day?

45:24.400 --> 45:25.833
- Ah, you know, the usual stuff.

45:25.833 --> 45:27.467
The Hook at lover's lane.

45:27.467 --> 45:30.600
Becky's grave, kid
wants his liver back.

45:30.600 --> 45:33.067
- It all sounds so scary.

45:33.067 --> 45:35.333
- Our urban legend was real.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.167
- Was real.

45:36.167 --> 45:37.600
Passed onto eternity.

45:37.600 --> 45:39.733
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

45:39.733 --> 45:41.233
Here, we'll use my equipment.

45:41.233 --> 45:43.600
I'm sure it's notches above
your amateur solute stuff.

45:43.600 --> 45:46.667
These are the EVP recorders
for when Stan get chatty.

45:46.667 --> 45:47.900
- When do
we leave for camp?

45:47.900 --> 45:49.633
- As soon as it stops raining.

45:49.633 --> 45:51.067
Tell you what, guys,
wait right here.

45:51.067 --> 45:51.900
I'll be right back.

45:51.900 --> 45:53.067
- Don't take too long.

45:54.167 --> 45:55.833
- What, are you afraid
it's gonna get dark?

45:55.833 --> 45:57.100
- Yeah, right.

45:57.100 --> 45:59.067
- I thought you guys
were ready for this.

45:59.067 --> 46:00.300
- We'll be fine.

46:28.100 --> 46:30.300
- Cemetery could be anywhere.

46:30.300 --> 46:32.967
- I'm sure it's
old and forgotten.

46:32.967 --> 46:35.500
- No wonder he's body's
in recent cemetery.

46:35.500 --> 46:36.633
- Who could blame them?

46:41.300 --> 46:42.533
What is it?

46:42.533 --> 46:44.733
- I thought
I saw something!

46:44.733 --> 46:45.900
- What?

46:45.900 --> 46:49.633
- The shape of a
person, I think.

46:49.633 --> 46:50.867
- There's no one there.

46:50.867 --> 46:53.467
- I think Randy is
on pinging needles.

46:53.467 --> 46:55.467
- Don't worry,
it's not the clown.

46:55.467 --> 46:57.367
- Yeah, right.

46:57.367 --> 46:59.900
- Come on, let's go wait
for Randy out in the hall.

47:03.067 --> 47:04.533
- Stan Cunningham.

47:05.633 --> 47:08.167
Let your spirit still
roam this halls.

47:12.333 --> 47:13.333
- Are you here?

47:14.367 --> 47:15.467
- Yes.

47:17.300 --> 47:18.833
- Why don't you leave?

47:18.833 --> 47:19.833
- No!

47:20.967 --> 47:22.333
- Why?

47:22.333 --> 47:24.067
- Work to do!

47:25.267 --> 47:26.267
- What work?

47:27.767 --> 47:29.100
- Chilly.

47:31.367 --> 47:32.200
- Where are you?

47:33.133 --> 47:35.200
- I am everywhere.

48:13.367 --> 48:16.800
- Randy said he wants
us to use his equipment.

48:16.800 --> 48:20.400
- Randy isn't here and his
equipment's cheaper than ours.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.267
Bad funding at the
station, maybe?

48:22.267 --> 48:24.767
- Might as well do
something while we wait.

48:24.767 --> 48:27.400
- Why don't we try
contacting the killer?

48:30.200 --> 48:32.867
- Stan Cunningham,
are you here with us?

48:34.167 --> 48:37.567
We call on you, Stan Cunningham,
killer of Camp Blood.

48:41.767 --> 48:43.800
Please, we ask that
you make contact.

48:44.867 --> 48:45.733
Are you here?

48:46.933 --> 48:48.067
- Yes.

48:48.067 --> 48:49.267
- Holy crap!

48:49.267 --> 48:51.333
- Ssh, don't break
communication.

48:51.333 --> 48:53.300
We wanna talk to you.

48:53.300 --> 48:56.200
- Speak while you can.

48:56.200 --> 48:57.700
- Why did you do it?

48:57.700 --> 49:00.100
Why did you kill all
these innocent people?

49:00.100 --> 49:02.133
- Want the true world.

49:04.767 --> 49:06.333
- Do you wanna move on?

49:06.333 --> 49:07.900
- No.

49:07.900 --> 49:09.167
- Why?

49:09.167 --> 49:11.133
- Work to do.

49:11.133 --> 49:12.133
- What work?

49:13.067 --> 49:15.167
- Kill, kill, kill!

49:16.567 --> 49:17.400
- AJ, stop!

49:18.233 --> 49:19.967
- Kill who?

49:19.967 --> 49:21.200
- You!

49:21.200 --> 49:24.067
Coming to get all of you.

49:28.933 --> 49:29.967
- Randy.

49:29.967 --> 49:31.167
Is that you?

49:32.733 --> 49:35.400
Why are you dressed like that?

49:35.400 --> 49:36.433
- You got us good.

49:36.433 --> 49:37.800
Fun is over.

49:37.800 --> 49:40.533
- Right, there's
something wrong with him.

49:40.533 --> 49:41.767
Stan, are you here?

49:43.700 --> 49:46.267
Are you possessing
Randy right now?

49:46.267 --> 49:47.100
Oh shit!

49:47.100 --> 49:48.767
- Let's get outta here!

50:12.733 --> 50:13.833
- Who's here?

50:49.567 --> 50:51.067
- Where he hell is everybody?

50:51.067 --> 50:52.600
- Randy's gone crazy!

50:52.600 --> 50:54.600
- He's possessed by the
spirit of Stan Cunningham.

50:54.600 --> 50:55.600
- We need to find
somewhere to hide now!

50:55.600 --> 50:56.433
- No doubt!

53:18.967 --> 53:20.367
- Who's in there?

53:29.267 --> 53:30.367
Banks, are you here?

53:33.067 --> 53:35.433
Banks, why are all
these lights on?

53:35.433 --> 53:37.867
You're wasting money
and electricity.

53:40.267 --> 53:42.100
And I saw a bunch
of kids running by.

53:46.533 --> 53:49.633
I knew I shouldn't have agreed
to that stupid show of his.

53:56.900 --> 53:57.900
Who are you?

54:02.600 --> 54:03.433
- Aw!

54:04.700 --> 54:05.967
What?

54:05.967 --> 54:06.933
What is this?

54:08.967 --> 54:11.500
We were partners, now
you're double crossing me?

54:11.500 --> 54:12.967
- News flash, you
tried to kill us.

54:12.967 --> 54:14.600
- What?

54:14.600 --> 54:17.100
I don't remember any of that.

54:17.100 --> 54:18.233
- What do you remember?

54:21.067 --> 54:22.500
- We were separated.

54:23.967 --> 54:26.800
I had the EVP recorder, I was
trying to talk to the killer.

54:29.467 --> 54:31.067
And I don't know.

54:31.067 --> 54:32.800
- I'll fill in the blanks.

54:32.800 --> 54:35.133
We're waiting for you when
you showed up with the mask

54:35.133 --> 54:36.367
and the knife of the killer

54:36.367 --> 54:38.600
and proceeded and
try and throttle us!

54:39.667 --> 54:40.667
- What knife?

54:40.667 --> 54:42.400
- The one next to you.

54:48.533 --> 54:49.667
- Untie me!

54:49.667 --> 54:50.500
Untie me now!

54:50.500 --> 54:51.333
We're in danger.

54:51.333 --> 54:52.167
- From you!

54:52.167 --> 54:53.600
- No, the killer!

54:54.533 --> 54:55.967
He must've possessed me.

54:58.367 --> 55:00.667
- How do we know that?

55:00.667 --> 55:02.367
- Whatever explanation
can there be?

55:02.367 --> 55:06.833
- You were going to harm us to
gain ratings on your TV show.

55:06.833 --> 55:07.667
- You know what?

55:07.667 --> 55:08.500
That's absurd.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.067
Untie me now!

55:10.067 --> 55:11.200
- Untie him, he's
telling the truth.

55:11.200 --> 55:12.067
- He tried to--

55:12.067 --> 55:13.267
- Do it!

55:13.267 --> 55:14.200
We're gonna need all
the help we can get

55:14.200 --> 55:15.200
if we wanna get out here alive.

55:20.233 --> 55:21.067
- Aw!

55:23.667 --> 55:27.067
Look, whatever I tried
to do, I'm sorry.

55:28.833 --> 55:30.300
- Sorry for us, clubbing you.

55:31.500 --> 55:33.800
- Yeah, I understand, I get it.

55:35.167 --> 55:36.500
- The doors were locked.

55:36.500 --> 55:37.333
Did you do that?

55:53.733 --> 55:56.700
- I don't even remember
touching anything.

55:56.700 --> 55:57.500
- Great.

56:05.433 --> 56:09.200
It's evil, the mask.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.633
I sense it.

56:10.633 --> 56:12.067
- Now what?

56:12.067 --> 56:13.733
- It's still we came here for.

56:13.733 --> 56:15.567
We're in a relatively
safe place.

56:15.567 --> 56:16.767
We have the mask.

56:16.767 --> 56:19.067
Let's just set Stan
Cunningham free.

56:19.067 --> 56:20.200
Get outta here.

56:20.200 --> 56:21.733
- Yeah, he's absolutely right.

56:21.733 --> 56:23.300
Put the mask down.

56:23.300 --> 56:24.833
Let's all sit facing it

56:24.833 --> 56:27.067
and see could release his
spirit to the other side.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.100
Try not to talk all at once.

56:47.100 --> 56:50.067
- Don't worry, I think Stan
will be doing all the talking.

56:50.067 --> 56:51.433
- Let's get started.

56:51.433 --> 56:53.600
We're safe if we stick together.

56:53.600 --> 56:55.200
- Okay, Randy.

56:55.200 --> 56:58.667
- Stan Cunningham, are you here?

56:58.667 --> 57:00.067
Are you with us?

57:00.067 --> 57:00.933
- Yes.

57:00.933 --> 57:02.667
- Why did you possess me?

57:02.667 --> 57:04.800
Make me attempt to
harm these kids?

57:04.800 --> 57:06.367
- Fun.

57:06.367 --> 57:07.500
- It was bad.

57:07.500 --> 57:09.300
It was a bad thing to do.

57:09.300 --> 57:11.067
- Fun not bad.

57:12.200 --> 57:13.200
- Why did you do it?

57:14.300 --> 57:17.067
- Enjoy
watching suffering.

57:17.067 --> 57:18.267
Death.

57:18.267 --> 57:21.433
- There's no joy in
someone's suffering.

57:21.433 --> 57:22.900
- There is.

57:22.900 --> 57:25.167
Will you suffer for me?

57:25.167 --> 57:26.067
- Never!

57:26.967 --> 57:28.400
- What do you want?

57:28.400 --> 57:29.800
- Mask.

57:29.800 --> 57:31.067
Want mask back.

57:32.200 --> 57:33.400
- Why?

57:33.400 --> 57:36.367
- Seen so much pain.

57:36.367 --> 57:38.067
Part of me.

57:38.067 --> 57:39.900
- How do we give it back to you?

57:39.900 --> 57:42.067
- Outfit.

57:42.067 --> 57:42.800
- Outfit?

57:43.667 --> 57:44.933
Is it nearby?

57:44.933 --> 57:46.200
- Yes.

57:46.200 --> 57:48.067
Cold, dark, need mask.

57:49.800 --> 57:51.500
- Why don't you cross over?

57:51.500 --> 57:54.267
You're done in this
plane of existence.

57:54.267 --> 57:55.767
- Need mask.

57:55.767 --> 57:57.733
Cross threshold then.

57:57.733 --> 57:59.567
Light scares me.

57:59.567 --> 58:02.300
- You can cross into the
light without the mask.

58:02.300 --> 58:04.700
- Need mask, please!

58:04.700 --> 58:06.333
Need mask!

58:06.333 --> 58:08.567
- Where's your outfit
so we can return it?

58:08.567 --> 58:11.333
- Nearby, very close.

58:11.333 --> 58:14.933
- If we give you your mask
back, will you cross over?

58:17.233 --> 58:18.633
I repeat.

58:18.633 --> 58:22.333
If we return the mask,
will you cross over?

58:23.733 --> 58:25.067
- He's gone.

58:25.067 --> 58:26.167
- Yes.

58:27.067 --> 58:28.633
- Which direction is it?

58:28.633 --> 58:29.500
Your outfit?

58:30.433 --> 58:32.233
- North.

58:37.067 --> 58:38.467
- Did you get that, kid?

58:38.467 --> 58:39.700
- Sure did.

58:39.700 --> 58:42.467
- Why is the mask
so important anyhow?

58:44.233 --> 58:47.633
- If it had significance in
his life, it will in his death.

58:48.900 --> 58:50.467
He needs to connect with it.

58:51.900 --> 58:55.433
While separated, he's restless
and roaming the netherworld

58:55.433 --> 58:56.667
until he gets it back.

58:57.767 --> 58:58.900
- What makes you
think he'll cross over

58:58.900 --> 59:00.100
once we give it to him?

59:00.967 --> 59:02.267
- What are you getting at?

59:03.733 --> 59:04.933
- Maybe the mask is
just what he needs

59:04.933 --> 59:06.467
to comeback in our world.

59:06.467 --> 59:08.200
Not crossover to the next.

59:08.200 --> 59:09.300
Maybe he's lying.

59:11.500 --> 59:13.967
- That's a chance we
gonna have to take.

59:13.967 --> 59:14.800
Come on.

59:27.367 --> 59:28.200
This way.

59:53.500 --> 59:55.533
- I think we're off the trail.

59:57.067 --> 59:58.433
- He said north.

59:58.433 --> 59:59.667
- He's dead.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:02.133
Maybe his sense of
direction's off.

01:00:02.133 --> 01:00:03.433
- Use the mask.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:04.267
- What?

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.933
- Yeah.

01:00:06.933 --> 01:00:10.667
If he wants it that bad, he
just might lead us right to him.

01:00:10.667 --> 01:00:12.533
- It's worth the try.

01:00:12.533 --> 01:00:14.433
- Like a dowsing rod.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.900
- I don't like the
look of this, guys.

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:19.167
- Run.

01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:20.300
I'll take him on so
you could get far away.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.200
- You'll be killed.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.067
- Just go!

01:02:22.067 --> 01:02:22.833
- Where?

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:24.633
- Try and get outside!

01:02:27.433 --> 01:02:29.400
Okay, motherfucker,
come play with me!

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.800
No fair, I can't do that.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.067
- What kind of game
are you playing?

01:04:35.067 --> 01:04:37.567
- Welcome to
my nightmare world

01:04:37.567 --> 01:04:41.800
where my victims relive
their deaths over and over.

01:04:44.067 --> 01:04:44.867
- No!

01:05:51.667 --> 01:05:53.367
- No, it's not real.

01:05:58.233 --> 01:05:59.100
It's an illusion.

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:01.833
- It was
real and still is.

01:06:03.067 --> 01:06:04.967
- That's impossible.

01:06:04.967 --> 01:06:08.800
- You will witness
more terror's today.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.500
- Figures you for dead.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.433
- Likewise.

01:06:54.433 --> 01:06:57.067
- The spirit of Stan is strong.

01:06:57.067 --> 01:07:02.067
I've seen horrible visions,
nightmares of past victims.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:03.700
- Me too.

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:04.633
- What do we do?

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:06.600
- Join him!

01:07:42.067 --> 01:07:45.433
- You said you
wanted an interview.

01:07:45.433 --> 01:07:46.267
Sit.

01:08:02.067 --> 01:08:03.167
- I'm the host.

01:08:03.167 --> 01:08:04.733
- Not today.

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.300
- Today on Voices From Beyond.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:10.367
- I'm the host.

01:08:10.367 --> 01:08:12.067
Today on Voices From Beyond,
we have our guest, Randy Banks,

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.899
former paranormal investigator.

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:19.133
- Former?

01:08:19.133 --> 01:08:20.533
- Tell us, Randy.

01:08:20.533 --> 01:08:23.067
Why you're so interested
in paranormal?

01:08:23.067 --> 01:08:24.399
- I always wanted
to get to the bottom

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.832
of whether ghosts
were real or not?

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:28.267
- And are they?

01:08:28.267 --> 01:08:29.433
- Yeah, hell yeah!

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:33.200
- And why the
fascination in me?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.966
Stan Cunningham, the
Camp Blood killer.

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:38.667
- You're the most profiled
killer in the history.

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:41.399
I wanted to know if heaven
and hell were real or not.

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.399
- Well?

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.933
- You tell me.

01:08:45.933 --> 01:08:49.367
- Yes, there is
a heaven and a hell.

01:08:49.367 --> 01:08:52.500
My ashes would sent me to hell.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.800
- Would have?

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.733
- If I choose
to cross over.

01:08:56.733 --> 01:08:57.700
- Can't you go into the light?

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.500
Isn't there a light?

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.832
- There is but
it's behind a locked door.

01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:05.667
The fiery way is wild.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.267
My victims told me to lead
to them but I'm do not dare.

01:09:11.267 --> 01:09:12.167
- Are you afraid?

01:09:13.466 --> 01:09:16.533
- Isn't you the one
afraid of finality?

01:09:16.533 --> 01:09:17.899
- You have to cross over.

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:20.933
- I don't
have to do shit!

01:09:29.133 --> 01:09:30.667
- This is fucked up!

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:31.500
Seriously!

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:48.633
- If ever I make it
outta here alive,

01:09:48.633 --> 01:09:51.367
I'm never go ghost
hunting again.

01:10:05.733 --> 01:10:06.867
No!

01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:08.100
No!

01:10:52.033 --> 01:10:54.600
- Why don't you go to
hell where you belong?

01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.200
- I'm not ready to, yet.

01:10:59.133 --> 01:11:00.667
- Finish me off!

01:11:00.667 --> 01:11:01.800
- With pleasure!

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.567
- The mask!

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:14.067
The mask, that's
where your power lie!

01:11:22.367 --> 01:11:23.367
Die!

01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:49.100
- Three, two.

01:11:52.067 --> 01:11:56.400

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.500
