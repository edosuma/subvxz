WEBVTT

00:03.922 --> 00:05.021
Jack, come on!

00:05.023 --> 00:06.589
All right, see you later.

00:06.591 --> 00:09.025
What are you doing? I thought
you were gonna help me clean up.

00:09.027 --> 00:10.994
- Dad, I have practice, remember?
- Where's your brother?

00:10.996 --> 00:12.729
He's still sleeping.
I tried waking him up.

00:12.731 --> 00:13.863
Sean, come on!

00:13.865 --> 00:15.698
You're gonna be late! Dad?

00:15.700 --> 00:17.233
We got a delivery.

00:17.235 --> 00:19.335
See you.

00:19.337 --> 00:20.603
Hey.

00:20.605 --> 00:21.638
What's going on?

00:21.640 --> 00:24.574
There a Danny or a Linda Reagan
at this address?

00:24.576 --> 00:26.909
I'm Danny Reagan, but,
I didn't order anything.

00:26.911 --> 00:30.380
I got about $12,000 worth of
merchandise for you on my truck.

00:30.382 --> 00:32.582
That's impossible.

00:32.584 --> 00:34.350
Hey, you or your brother know
anything about this?

00:34.352 --> 00:36.085
No, and Jack didn't
say anything.

00:36.087 --> 00:37.420
Get dressed,
you're running late.

00:37.422 --> 00:38.655
Look, I'm telling you,
it's not my stuff.

00:38.657 --> 00:40.857
Dispatch gave me the forwarding
address for you guys.

00:40.859 --> 00:42.292
I didn't order anything,
and my wife...

00:42.294 --> 00:44.327
it couldn't be her.

00:44.329 --> 00:46.763
All right? She's never
even lived at this address.

00:46.765 --> 00:48.285
Look, maybe you should
call the police.

00:53.138 --> 00:55.738
What's the beef about this time?

00:55.740 --> 00:57.507
Local mosque opens up
a religious school next door.

00:57.509 --> 00:58.909
Some of the neighbors
don't like it.

01:00.645 --> 01:01.911
How you making out?

01:01.913 --> 01:03.313
Okay, so far.

01:03.315 --> 01:04.480
We don't want your problems

01:04.482 --> 01:06.716
on our block. What problems?

01:06.718 --> 01:08.751
It's just a madrassa,
a religious school for children.

01:08.753 --> 01:10.586
Then why don't you put it
in one of your neighborhoods?

01:10.588 --> 01:12.088
You don't belong here.

01:12.090 --> 01:13.056
"Don't belong here"?

01:13.058 --> 01:14.424
I was born in this city.

01:14.426 --> 01:15.692
Let's see some proof.

01:15.694 --> 01:17.660
My brother, I don't need
to prove anything to you.

01:17.662 --> 01:19.562
Who you calling "brother"?

01:19.564 --> 01:21.831
You're not related to me.

01:21.833 --> 01:23.866
You don't want to be
doing that, all right?

01:23.868 --> 01:25.802
My religion is peaceful,
but I got my limits.

01:25.804 --> 01:27.437
I got mine, too, Osama.

01:27.439 --> 01:28.971
So why don't you
saddle up that camel

01:28.973 --> 01:30.406
and ride on back to the desert?

01:30.408 --> 01:32.408
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:32.410 --> 01:33.743
Hey! Hey! Back it up!

01:33.745 --> 01:36.713
Break it up! Hey!
Break it up, break it up.

01:37.415 --> 01:38.681
Hey! You just put your hands

01:38.683 --> 01:40.116
on a New York City
police officer.

01:40.118 --> 01:41.718
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, let it go.
Eddie, let it go.

01:41.720 --> 01:43.186
It's okay, we're good.

01:44.556 --> 01:47.023
Do you mind telling me
what that's about?

01:47.025 --> 01:48.791
What what was about?

01:48.793 --> 01:51.361
We could've just
collared that guy.

01:51.363 --> 01:52.995
Hey, who is he?

01:52.997 --> 01:56.399
Last time I saw him he was
in my company in the academy.

01:56.401 --> 02:00.303
First, he was there, and then,
he just wasn't there anymore.

02:08.012 --> 02:09.779
Where's the prisoner?

02:09.781 --> 02:11.481
I pulled him out
of a holding cell.

02:11.483 --> 02:12.715
Assumed you'd want privacy.

02:12.717 --> 02:13.850
Exactly right.

02:13.852 --> 02:14.951
This way.

02:14.953 --> 02:16.319
Thank you.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.682 --> 02:46.449
I can't explain.

02:46.451 --> 02:48.951
You mean, you can explain?

02:48.953 --> 02:51.587
No. I mean,
I don't know what happened.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.689
One minute, I'm having
my second drink at a bar,

02:53.691 --> 02:56.659
and the next thing I know, I...
I'm waking up in a holding cell

02:56.661 --> 02:58.828
like I'ml'm coming out
of an anesthesia.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.129
Lenny, it's almost 3:00 a.m.

03:00.131 --> 03:02.031
Bad time for bad excuses.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.433
I swear.

03:03.435 --> 03:06.469
My watch is gone,
my wallet's gone.

03:06.471 --> 03:08.237
I don't know what happened
to my pants.

03:08.239 --> 03:12.008
I didn't get out of bed
because your pants are missing.

03:14.446 --> 03:17.447
They say I shot somebody.

03:17.449 --> 03:20.116
Actually, you shot two people.

03:22.987 --> 03:25.855
Lucky for you,
neither one's likely.

03:28.126 --> 03:29.125
Frank, you can't believe

03:29.127 --> 03:31.828
that I did something
like this, can you?

03:31.830 --> 03:34.297
Lenny, if you could see
what I'm looking at,

03:34.299 --> 03:37.233
you wouldn't know
what to believe, either.

03:37.235 --> 03:40.503
Frank, it's me.

03:41.406 --> 03:44.740
Yeah, it's you.

03:44.742 --> 03:48.711
Exactly.

04:21.021 --> 04:22.453
Great, I understand.

04:22.455 --> 04:24.489
Thanks.

04:24.491 --> 04:26.057
Good morning.

04:26.059 --> 04:27.525
Morning.

04:27.527 --> 04:28.760
You look like hell.

04:28.762 --> 04:30.161
Thank you.

04:30.163 --> 04:31.262
I'm sorry, but...

04:31.264 --> 04:33.931
Well, I got about
three hours sleep.

04:33.933 --> 04:35.967
Well, if this
is about Uncle Lenny,

04:35.969 --> 04:37.502
we don't have
a special prosecutor

04:37.504 --> 04:39.470
in charge of your expartners.

04:39.472 --> 04:41.039
Hey, did I ask you for anything?

04:41.041 --> 04:42.407
Come on, Dad, you taught us

04:42.409 --> 04:45.910
to go see the person
we need a favor from in person.

04:45.912 --> 04:47.779
Will you let me speak? Sure.

04:47.781 --> 04:50.581
I need to ask you for something.

04:50.583 --> 04:52.650
I don't know how much I can do.

04:52.652 --> 04:55.219
The cash bail has already been
set for half a million dollars.

04:55.221 --> 04:56.454
Seems a little high,
don't you think?

04:56.456 --> 04:58.423
Not from where I'm sitting.

04:58.425 --> 05:01.759
He shot a bouncer and a dancer
in a strip club.

05:01.761 --> 05:05.396
He says he has
no memory of that.

05:05.398 --> 05:07.698
Do you believe him?

05:08.535 --> 05:11.502
Yeah, I think I do.

05:11.504 --> 05:14.338
That "think"
kind of waters it down.

05:14.340 --> 05:19.043
Look, Lenny is one
of my oldest friends, and...

05:19.045 --> 05:22.680
And let me gently remind
you that you used to say

05:22.682 --> 05:26.851
Lenny Ross could sell ice to
an Eskimo and sand to a Bedouin.

05:26.853 --> 05:29.587
Which was meant as a compliment
to his imagination.

05:29.589 --> 05:32.056
Which was meant to say
he's a fast talker.

05:32.058 --> 05:36.027
Which is a far cry
from shooting up a strip club.

05:36.029 --> 05:39.697
You want me to look
the other way because it's him?

05:39.699 --> 05:41.132
No. I do not.

05:41.134 --> 05:43.634
In fact, I'm asking
for the opposite.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.303
Meaning?

05:45.305 --> 05:48.372
Meaning that because
I know the defendant,

05:48.374 --> 05:50.241
I want to put up a firewall.

05:50.243 --> 05:53.611
I am more comfortable...
In this particular instance...

05:53.613 --> 05:54.745
With your office

05:54.747 --> 05:57.415
taking a more active role.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.517
You want the DA's office

05:59.519 --> 06:03.087
to take the lead
and run with this investigation?

06:03.089 --> 06:07.024
I didn't say "run,"
I said take a more active role.

06:07.026 --> 06:09.961
How well do you still know him?

06:09.963 --> 06:12.163
What's that supposed to mean?

06:12.165 --> 06:13.698
It means people can change.

06:13.700 --> 06:17.301
It means what was hijinks
back in the day can become

06:17.303 --> 06:19.504
hardcore lifestyle later on.

06:19.506 --> 06:20.638
I mean, I've read his book.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.473
He is no altar boy.

06:22.475 --> 06:24.642
Doesn't make him a felon.

06:24.644 --> 06:27.411
Shooting up a strip club does.

06:27.413 --> 06:29.313
Hey.

06:29.315 --> 06:31.382
Do your thing.

06:31.384 --> 06:35.019
And if your friend turns out
to be the bad guy here,

06:35.021 --> 06:36.587
you cannot expect any leniency

06:36.589 --> 06:38.456
from this office.

06:38.458 --> 06:41.092
Nor would I ask for any.

06:41.094 --> 06:42.593
As you well know.

06:52.105 --> 06:53.804
Hey.

06:55.775 --> 06:57.208
Hey.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.543
- How are you?
- Good.

06:58.545 --> 07:00.077
Thanks for meeting me
uptown, Jamie, man.

07:00.079 --> 07:01.812
I got to stay away from places
where people know me.

07:01.814 --> 07:02.980
Yeah, absolutely, no problem.

07:02.982 --> 07:04.682
This is my partner Eddie Janko.

07:04.684 --> 07:06.083
A pleasure, Officer.

07:06.085 --> 07:08.219
Sorry if I got
a little handsy on the street.

07:08.221 --> 07:10.855
It's okay.
I just was a little confused.

07:10.857 --> 07:12.857
And I... I still am.

07:12.859 --> 07:14.258
What's going on, Tariq?

07:14.260 --> 07:16.294
I haven't seen you since you
dropped out of the academy.

07:16.296 --> 07:17.595
Dropped out?

07:17.597 --> 07:18.596
I didn't drop out.

07:18.598 --> 07:19.830
I got pulled out.

07:19.832 --> 07:21.098
By who?

07:21.100 --> 07:22.700
You really didn't know?

07:24.337 --> 07:26.270
I guess you're not supposed to.

07:26.272 --> 07:27.939
I'm an undercover.

07:27.941 --> 07:29.407
You're still a cop?

07:29.409 --> 07:30.908
Almost ten years.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.476
Gave me my shield, took it away,

07:32.478 --> 07:34.412
said go meld in
with the community.

07:34.414 --> 07:38.316
It's getting so I don't even
know who I am anymore.

07:38.318 --> 07:40.051
That's why I reached out, Jamie.

07:40.053 --> 07:42.486
What's going on?

07:43.856 --> 07:45.823
I can't take it anymore.

07:45.825 --> 07:47.191
The first three years were okay,

07:47.193 --> 07:48.960
now it's like
I've been in Siberia.

07:48.962 --> 07:51.362
I'm barely in contact
with anyone at the department.

07:51.364 --> 07:52.763
Well, I mean, I guess
that's what it's like

07:52.765 --> 07:54.765
when you're working a
deep cover assignment.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.801
Yeah. Now it's gone too far.

07:56.803 --> 07:58.970
It's like
they've forgotten about me.

07:58.972 --> 08:01.405
I can't get promoted,
I can't have a real life.

08:03.276 --> 08:06.544
I'm sorry, Tariq, I mean, not...
nothing I can do about that.

08:06.546 --> 08:09.413
Remember that time we talked
about our fathers

08:09.415 --> 08:11.182
after the last study session?

08:14.854 --> 08:17.355
Look, I hate to put you
on the spot, Jamie.

08:17.357 --> 08:20.224
Tariq, look, I...

08:20.226 --> 08:21.559
I can't just walk into One PP

08:21.561 --> 08:24.996
and ask my father for a favor
every time a cop comes to me

08:24.998 --> 08:26.631
about a rotten assignment,
I just...

08:26.633 --> 08:29.900
I get that, Jamie, but...

08:29.902 --> 08:32.736
look, I'm getting desperate,
man.

08:32.739 --> 08:35.773
I got nowhere else to turn.

08:39.611 --> 08:41.679
<i>What the hell
are you people talking about?</i>

08:41.681 --> 08:43.714
I never bought
any refrigerators,

08:43.716 --> 08:47.418
and I sure as hell didn't
buy any juice makers.

08:47.420 --> 08:48.419
Now, you're gonna

08:48.421 --> 08:50.087
take those charges
off my account,

08:50.089 --> 08:51.789
or you're gonna know
what trouble is, you got it?

08:51.791 --> 08:52.923
Goodbye.

08:52.925 --> 08:54.025
Reagan.

08:54.027 --> 08:55.326
Can you believe this?

08:55.328 --> 08:58.229
Over a hundred thousand dollars
so far charged

08:58.231 --> 08:59.997
on credits cards in mine
and Linda's name,

08:59.999 --> 09:01.866
and we didn't buy any of it.

09:01.868 --> 09:03.034
Reagan, this is
Detective Chamberlain

09:03.036 --> 09:04.568
from I.D. Theft Squad.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.671
He's been looking into who
could've done this to you.

09:06.673 --> 09:09.307
This follows a pattern
we've been seeing from groups

09:09.309 --> 09:10.508
like the Albanian mafia.

09:10.510 --> 09:11.942
Now, they open
credit card accounts

09:11.944 --> 09:13.577
in other people's names,
and they use them

09:13.579 --> 09:15.646
to buy millions of dollars
of goods.

09:15.648 --> 09:18.416
Then they fence the goods
to finance major arms deals.

09:18.418 --> 09:20.351
Okay, but where the hell'd
they get the information

09:20.353 --> 09:21.519
for the accounts?

09:21.521 --> 09:22.520
None of it's online.

09:22.522 --> 09:24.488
Been having any problems
with anybody lately?

09:25.291 --> 09:27.158
Every single day,
I'm a detective.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.527
That's not what I mean.
They need inside information

09:29.529 --> 09:31.796
to get past
the security questions.

09:31.798 --> 09:34.632
They normally get that
from someone closer to you.

09:39.539 --> 09:42.573
I always wonder why they call it
a "gentleman's club."

09:42.575 --> 09:44.608
Looks better on your
credit card receipts?

09:44.610 --> 09:46.310
Excuse me.

09:46.312 --> 09:47.645
Management around?

09:48.514 --> 09:50.314
Yo, Mickey.

09:53.453 --> 09:55.986
I'm Detective ABETEMARCO,
this is ADA Reagan.

09:55.988 --> 09:57.321
You the manager?

09:57.323 --> 09:58.456
Yeah, Mickey Cardoza.

09:58.458 --> 09:59.757
I was on the job in Suffolk.

09:59.759 --> 10:01.359
Were you here
when the shooting happened?

10:01.361 --> 10:02.660
Yeah, it was wild.

10:02.662 --> 10:04.862
One minute, this Lenny walks in.

10:04.864 --> 10:06.130
Everything's normal.

10:06.132 --> 10:07.298
The next,
he's whipping his gun out.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.299
We're in the Wild West.

10:08.301 --> 10:10.134
Did you see what
precipitated it?

10:10.136 --> 10:12.069
Nothing, far as I could tell.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.304
Said he was here
to meet a friend,

10:13.306 --> 10:14.939
talk about investing
in the club.

10:14.941 --> 10:16.173
The friend ever show?

10:16.175 --> 10:17.508
No.

10:17.510 --> 10:19.076
So this Lenny character
said he'd stick around,

10:19.078 --> 10:20.611
have a couple of drinks,
a few laughs.

10:20.613 --> 10:22.613
I look up, he's on stage
with the girls,

10:22.615 --> 10:23.914
taking his clothes off.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.416
My bouncer tries
to get him down.

10:25.418 --> 10:26.517
He starts shooting.

10:26.519 --> 10:27.918
Did he have a lot to drink?

10:27.920 --> 10:28.919
Not that much. Am I right?

10:28.921 --> 10:30.688
No. But some people

10:30.690 --> 10:32.456
can't handle their liquor.

10:32.458 --> 10:33.624
He was blabbing
about how he's friends

10:33.626 --> 10:35.526
with the police commissioner
and all that.

10:35.528 --> 10:37.728
Got any video?

10:37.730 --> 10:39.363
Nah, camera's empty.

10:39.365 --> 10:40.931
Just there for security.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.200
Truth is, part of what
people are paying for here

10:43.202 --> 10:44.668
is discretion, right?

10:44.670 --> 10:45.736
We can't protect that,
we're out of business.

10:45.738 --> 10:46.937
Make sense?

10:51.144 --> 10:52.810
You know this could be
a wildgoose chase

10:52.812 --> 10:53.944
you got us on, Danny.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.379
Says you.

10:55.381 --> 10:57.782
I say this is the spot where
the stuff that was ordered

10:57.784 --> 10:59.717
was supposed to be
delivered. Ergo...

10:59.719 --> 11:01.385
Ergo, it's where we'll find
whoever was scamming you.

11:01.387 --> 11:02.620
It doesn't necessarily mean

11:02.622 --> 11:04.221
<i>- it's someone you know.
- Unless...</i>

11:05.191 --> 11:06.657
Hang on.

11:06.659 --> 11:08.058
What do you got?

11:09.128 --> 11:10.594
I don't want to say it.

11:10.596 --> 11:12.062
You don't want to say what?

11:12.064 --> 11:13.264
"You're right again, Reagan"?

11:13.266 --> 11:14.432
You're right this time.

11:14.434 --> 11:15.933
It's him.

11:15.935 --> 11:17.701
And he's here.

11:17.703 --> 11:20.171
Beautiful.

11:20.173 --> 11:22.907
All right.

11:22.909 --> 11:24.642
Read them and weep, fellas.

11:24.644 --> 11:25.609
It's a full boat.

11:25.611 --> 11:27.278
Yeah, baby.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.414
You cheat. Don't be ridiculous.

11:30.416 --> 11:31.749
You're bottom dealing.

11:33.352 --> 11:34.652
Saved by the bell.

11:34.654 --> 11:36.253
Maybe you guys
sent in your cooler

11:36.255 --> 11:37.321
'cause I'm so hot right now.

11:37.323 --> 11:38.556
All right, all right,

11:38.558 --> 11:40.090
keep your shirt on.

11:40.092 --> 11:42.359
Yeah?

11:42.361 --> 11:44.195
Hi. My God.

11:44.197 --> 11:45.529
I'm so sorry to bother you.

11:45.531 --> 11:47.031
I just hit a car out here

11:47.033 --> 11:48.833
and the fender's hanging off.

11:48.835 --> 11:50.267
It's a Camaro, I think.

11:50.269 --> 11:51.702
A Camaro?

11:51.704 --> 11:54.171
That's my car.
Show me what you did.

11:55.241 --> 11:57.441
Hey. Danny.

11:59.412 --> 12:02.046
Baez, meet the scumbag
who made up a scam

12:02.048 --> 12:03.514
using my dead wife's name.

12:03.516 --> 12:06.183
Not to mention, he happens
to be her brother!

12:06.185 --> 12:08.152
Danny, I think you broke
my nose, man.

12:08.154 --> 12:10.321
You think?!
You want me to finish the job?

12:10.323 --> 12:12.256
Okay, okay, come on.

12:12.258 --> 12:14.758
Let's go. Come on.

12:28.464 --> 12:29.996
What are you doing?

12:29.998 --> 12:31.998
You uncuffed that dirtbag?!

12:32.000 --> 12:34.167
And you, you proud of yourself?

12:34.169 --> 12:36.536
You mean generally
or right this second?

12:36.538 --> 12:40.073
You're running a credit card
scam for the Albanian mob?

12:41.944 --> 12:44.311
I can see how it looks that way.

12:44.313 --> 12:47.881
You know, I ought
to kick the crap out of you.

12:47.883 --> 12:50.484
Using Linda's ID,
your own sister?

12:50.486 --> 12:51.752
After you missed the funeral?

12:51.754 --> 12:53.220
I tried, Danny.

12:53.222 --> 12:55.422
I missed the flight.
Get out of here.

12:55.424 --> 12:56.757
How the hell did you
get the information

12:56.759 --> 12:57.991
to start the fake accounts?

12:57.993 --> 13:01.261
Linda was trying to help me
get back on my feet.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.429
She didn't want you to know

13:02.431 --> 13:03.897
because she thought
you'd get mad.

13:03.899 --> 13:05.432
She was right.

13:05.434 --> 13:06.662
Baez, you might want
to stop outside.

13:06.663 --> 13:08.296
I'm gonna have to have a
different kind of conversation.

13:08.298 --> 13:09.364
No, no, no, miss, please.

13:09.366 --> 13:10.732
Do not leave me alone
with this animal.

13:10.734 --> 13:11.866
Give me one good reason why
I shouldn't take you down

13:11.868 --> 13:13.134
to Central Booking right now.

13:13.136 --> 13:14.369
You know what, Danny?

13:14.371 --> 13:15.537
Your side of the street
ain't so clean, either.

13:15.539 --> 13:16.738
Okay, you know what?

13:16.740 --> 13:19.207
Maybe I will go out and
make that cup of tea.

13:21.044 --> 13:22.410
Last time I saw you,

13:22.412 --> 13:24.979
you dropped me off at a mob
joint to catch a beatdown.

13:24.981 --> 13:26.314
That's because
they were gonna kill you

13:26.316 --> 13:28.850
for busting a champagne bottle
over a made guy's head.

13:28.852 --> 13:30.618
I bargained for your life!

13:30.620 --> 13:33.188
You could get in trouble
if I talked.

13:33.190 --> 13:34.989
What? What'd you say?

13:34.991 --> 13:36.191
Not that I would do that, Danny.

13:36.193 --> 13:37.826
I wouldn't do that.

13:37.828 --> 13:41.729
What the hell am I
gonna do with you?

13:41.731 --> 13:43.665
Danny, I'm sorry
I'm in deep again.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.099
I had nowhere else to go

13:45.101 --> 13:46.801
'cause you told me to stay away.

13:46.803 --> 13:48.169
Poor you, right?

13:48.171 --> 13:51.105
Poor little Jimmy
all over again.

13:51.107 --> 13:53.374
You're gonna have
to make right on this one.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.909
And you're gonna make right
by wearing a wire.

13:54.911 --> 13:57.846
A wire? Danny.
These guys are killers.

13:57.848 --> 13:59.314
That's right.
They're responsible

13:59.316 --> 14:01.549
for a half dozen murders, so
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

14:01.551 --> 14:03.718
You wear the wire
or me and you are done.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.353
If you get locked up

14:05.355 --> 14:07.455
and your ass goes to prison,

14:07.457 --> 14:10.124
don't expect a visit
from the family.

14:25.876 --> 14:27.842
Erin's taking a look.

14:27.844 --> 14:30.345
That's good.

14:30.347 --> 14:32.881
I didn't ask her to overlook,
just look.

14:32.883 --> 14:34.682
Still good.
I got nothing to hide.

14:34.684 --> 14:37.352
Still, your lawyer ought
to be looking at plea options.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.387
Wow, thanks for the
vote of confidence.

14:39.389 --> 14:40.952
Hey, come on.
You know how this works.

14:40.976 --> 14:41.190
Yeah.

14:41.191 --> 14:43.691
You don't shoot a racehorse just
'cause he's got a little limp.

14:43.693 --> 14:46.628
That's a stupid metaphor.

14:46.630 --> 14:49.264
You know, Lenny, I have
known you a long time,

14:49.266 --> 14:52.467
which means I know how you like
to shadowbox the truth.

14:52.469 --> 14:54.168
This isn't like that.
This is different.

14:54.170 --> 14:57.138
Then give me something besides
"the dog ate my homework."

14:57.140 --> 15:00.375
I was supposed to meet a guy

15:00.377 --> 15:01.976
about going in
on a piece of the club.

15:01.978 --> 15:03.411
What guy?

15:03.413 --> 15:05.313
Bobby Z.

15:05.315 --> 15:06.648
I only knew him by text.

15:06.650 --> 15:09.717
If they dump my phone,
you can get the number.

15:09.719 --> 15:11.686
That's how
you're doing business now?

15:11.688 --> 15:13.087
A "Bobby Z"?

15:13.089 --> 15:15.957
I'm gonna let that go.

15:15.959 --> 15:19.227
He was partners with
one Mickey Cardoza.

15:21.965 --> 15:25.033
Related to Detective
Sal Cardoza?

15:25.035 --> 15:27.769
The same. Youngest son.

15:29.839 --> 15:32.307
Shakedown Sal Cardoza.

15:32.309 --> 15:35.209
I had hoped that story
died with him.

15:35.211 --> 15:37.345
Not the department's
finest hour.

15:37.347 --> 15:39.247
I didn't even put it in my book.

15:39.249 --> 15:40.949
Yeah, I know. I read the book.

15:40.951 --> 15:42.083
So you see.

15:42.085 --> 15:45.286
Things I wish I could unsee.

15:45.288 --> 15:47.288
Well, Erin's smart.

15:47.290 --> 15:49.357
She'll figure out a way to put
this two and two together

15:49.359 --> 15:51.893
without linking it
to back in the day.

15:51.895 --> 15:54.629
Fudge.

15:54.631 --> 15:56.164
I'm used to seeing
my Rolex here,

15:56.166 --> 15:58.967
the one that you and the guys
gave me for my retirement.

15:58.969 --> 16:01.269
I never took it off except
to read the inscription.

16:01.271 --> 16:03.938
Laying it on a little thick,
aren't we?

16:03.940 --> 16:05.406
Hey, that was an
extravagant watch

16:05.408 --> 16:06.975
for guys making what we made.

16:12.315 --> 16:14.515
What?

16:19.522 --> 16:22.156
So who lifted the watch
from the property room?

16:25.962 --> 16:28.596
Little Richie.

16:28.598 --> 16:31.632
Obviously, I only found out
about it much later.

16:31.634 --> 16:33.534
Obviously.

16:35.338 --> 16:36.871
Little Richie.

16:36.873 --> 16:38.840
What a piece of work?

16:38.842 --> 16:40.274
So, we eating?

16:40.276 --> 16:43.511
Yeah, but I ain't drinking
with you.

16:51.354 --> 16:53.321
Tariq's got
a legitimate complaint.

16:53.323 --> 16:54.389
He's been working undercover

16:54.391 --> 16:55.757
since we were in the same
company at the academy.

16:55.759 --> 16:58.259
Then he should know enough not
to be talking out of turn.

16:58.261 --> 16:59.627
We let every cop

16:59.629 --> 17:00.995
dictate their own assignment,

17:00.997 --> 17:03.598
we have anarchy instead
of a police department.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.599
But he deserves a shot
at a promotion, right?

17:05.602 --> 17:06.800
And a chance at a normal life.

17:06.803 --> 17:08.569
He's paid his dues
ten times over

17:08.570 --> 17:10.538
to both this city
and this country.

17:10.540 --> 17:12.006
Listen,
he's a precious commodity.

17:12.008 --> 17:14.541
Speaks Arabic,
knows his community,

17:14.544 --> 17:16.144
writes great reports.

17:16.146 --> 17:17.545
I could use a couple
of thousand of him.

17:17.547 --> 17:20.515
So he's getting punished
for doing a good job?

17:20.517 --> 17:21.715
It's not a punishment.

17:21.718 --> 17:23.584
Well, he's got no path
to promotion.

17:23.586 --> 17:25.520
It's called public service,
Jamie.

17:25.521 --> 17:26.921
That's how it is sometimes.

17:26.923 --> 17:31.259
And would it be the same if his
name was Rizzuto or O'Hara

17:31.261 --> 17:33.227
instead of Ali?
That's got nothing to do with it.

17:33.229 --> 17:35.696
All right? Your friend is where
he is because we need him there.

17:35.698 --> 17:36.998
For how long?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.535
I can't answer that.

17:40.537 --> 17:43.504
So he just needs to suck it up

17:43.506 --> 17:45.406
'cause he doesn't have
a hook at One PP?

17:45.408 --> 17:48.443
I'm sorry, Jamie, you know?

17:48.445 --> 17:51.079
Sometimes you got to
take one for the team.

17:57.787 --> 17:59.153
<i>It's Jimmy.</i>

17:59.155 --> 18:00.755
<i>He's been hiding here
since you last saw him.</i>

18:00.757 --> 18:02.490
He has the door
locked from the inside.

18:02.492 --> 18:04.192
Says he won't come out
until you get here.

18:04.194 --> 18:05.660
I know he's your brotherinlaw...

18:05.662 --> 18:07.895
Former brotherinlaw
and former best friend.

18:07.897 --> 18:09.163
Those days are over.

18:09.165 --> 18:10.231
- Is this the room?
- Yeah.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.232
Great.

18:11.234 --> 18:12.934
Jimmy, I'm coming in!

18:12.936 --> 18:14.602
Hey!

18:14.604 --> 18:16.537
Come here.

18:16.539 --> 18:18.606
You're lucky I don't throw you
out the window facefirst.

18:18.608 --> 18:19.874
Get up!

18:19.876 --> 18:22.143
Get up! Get him out of here!
Take it easy.

18:22.145 --> 18:24.212
Get out of here! Relax, dude.

18:24.214 --> 18:26.380
Nice bathtub.

18:40.516 --> 18:41.966
You!

18:41.974 --> 18:43.301
Cut the music!

18:43.302 --> 18:45.235
All right, everybody
out of the pool.

18:45.237 --> 18:47.904
Fun time is over.

18:48.611 --> 18:50.182
What are you guys doing here?

18:50.183 --> 18:52.784
- I answered all your questions.
- Not quite.

18:52.786 --> 18:54.752
That's a warrant for us to
search the premises, Mickey.

18:54.754 --> 18:55.920
Go ahead and take it.

18:55.922 --> 18:57.589
What's your probable cause?

18:57.591 --> 18:59.624
Right, you did mention
that you were on the job.

18:59.626 --> 19:01.392
What you failed to mention was

19:01.394 --> 19:03.995
that your father worked
with Lenny Ross.

19:03.997 --> 19:06.030
Is that right? What if he did?

19:06.032 --> 19:07.832
See, my father's been dead
20 years

19:07.834 --> 19:10.034
and Lenny Ross just shot up
my club,

19:10.036 --> 19:11.736
so who's the bad guy here?

19:11.738 --> 19:12.971
That's what we're trying
to find out.

19:12.973 --> 19:14.639
There've been a lot of reports

19:14.641 --> 19:17.242
of customers having
their personal property

19:17.244 --> 19:18.576
stolen from here.

19:18.578 --> 19:20.545
You can come in
and answer some questions

19:20.547 --> 19:22.313
or we'll just keep the place
shut down, Mickey.

19:22.315 --> 19:23.915
I'm coming. I'm coming.

19:23.917 --> 19:25.016
Sorry, Miss Reagan.

19:25.018 --> 19:26.150
You accused me of holding out

19:26.152 --> 19:28.219
on my father working
with Lenny Ross.

19:28.221 --> 19:30.421
What about your father
and Lenny Ross?

19:31.758 --> 19:33.224
You're not just carrying the
water for your old man, are you?

19:33.226 --> 19:34.359
All right, come on, let's go.

19:34.361 --> 19:35.326
- That's not a fair question?
- Let's go.

19:35.328 --> 19:36.594
- Right?
- Shut up, Mickey.

19:50.268 --> 19:53.262
Get in. Sit down and shut up.

19:53.263 --> 19:54.532
Danny, what's going on?

19:54.556 --> 19:55.931
What's going on?!
I'm gonna put you back

19:55.932 --> 19:57.768
in intensive care,
that's what's going on.

19:57.792 --> 19:58.367
Hey, I'm sorry.

19:58.368 --> 20:00.034
Danny, come on. Stop it.

20:00.036 --> 20:01.702
I'm sorry, I panicked.
All right?

20:01.704 --> 20:04.872
Panicked my ass.

20:04.874 --> 20:06.107
You know, I worked
out a deal for you.

20:06.109 --> 20:07.909
I worked out a deal for you

20:07.911 --> 20:09.677
because we were friends,

20:09.679 --> 20:11.813
and because Linda
was your sister.

20:11.815 --> 20:13.815
Now you're dead to me.

20:13.817 --> 20:15.149
Okay, Reagan, get out of here.

20:15.151 --> 20:16.150
What are you talking about?

20:16.152 --> 20:17.485
You asked me to step out before,

20:17.487 --> 20:19.120
now I'm asking you...
You're too hot.

20:21.257 --> 20:23.658
Don't think you're
getting off easy.

20:32.268 --> 20:33.267
He's not totally
wrong, you know.

20:33.269 --> 20:34.402
He threatened to put me back

20:34.404 --> 20:35.703
in the hospital again...
You heard him.

20:35.705 --> 20:36.938
That was all talk.

20:36.940 --> 20:38.606
He's been having a rough time.

20:38.608 --> 20:40.274
You know why, don't you?

20:40.276 --> 20:42.510
Yeah, I get it.

20:43.780 --> 20:46.380
She wasn't just his wife.

20:46.382 --> 20:49.283
She was my sister.

20:49.285 --> 20:52.453
I never got a chance
to say goodbye to her...

20:52.455 --> 20:55.823
because I was too afraid
to go to the funeral.

21:00.330 --> 21:04.165
You know, to be honest with you,

21:04.167 --> 21:07.869
I think she was ashamed of me
the last time I saw her.

21:07.871 --> 21:10.304
So you honor her
by using her identity

21:10.306 --> 21:11.973
to set up a credit card scam?

21:11.975 --> 21:14.508
I'm not a bad person.

21:15.612 --> 21:17.712
I just make bad decisions.

21:17.714 --> 21:21.849
I had a brother
who was like that.

21:21.851 --> 21:23.784
You gotta make this right.

21:23.786 --> 21:26.087
By risking my life
and wearing a wire?

21:26.089 --> 21:28.489
You run now, you'll
never stop running.

21:28.491 --> 21:30.691
Even if you could outrun
Danny and the Feds,

21:30.693 --> 21:32.460
you could never
outrun the shame.

21:35.198 --> 21:37.131
Maybe you're right.

21:37.133 --> 21:40.468
This is your last chance
to turn your life around.

21:40.470 --> 21:44.338
Come on,
I know you got it in you.

21:46.276 --> 21:49.877
Fine, put a mic on me.

21:49.879 --> 21:52.680
I'm sick of running.

22:01.758 --> 22:03.391
He went for it.

22:13.169 --> 22:15.803
So you had no idea
that Lenny Ross and your father

22:15.805 --> 22:17.972
had a beef back in the day.
What I know is it don't matter.

22:17.974 --> 22:20.274
I never laid eyes on Ross
until the other night.

22:20.276 --> 22:22.276
Come on, you gotta
admit it, Mickey.

22:22.278 --> 22:25.646
- Looks a little suspicious.
- Wow.

22:25.648 --> 22:26.881
See, you don't look like
a yoga master,

22:26.883 --> 22:28.215
but that's quite a stretch.

22:28.217 --> 22:30.284
You're saying it's
my father's fault

22:30.286 --> 22:32.019
that Lenny Ross
pulled a gun in my club?

22:32.021 --> 22:35.189
After you had a contact
invite him and not show.

22:35.191 --> 22:36.924
That's circumstantial.
That don't prove nothing.

22:36.926 --> 22:39.660
Why don't you make this
easy on yourself?

22:39.662 --> 22:41.228
Why don't I make this
easy on myself?

22:41.230 --> 22:42.763
You mean help the police
commissioner's friend?

22:42.765 --> 22:44.498
The man who destroyed my family?

22:44.500 --> 22:46.701
See? Now we're
getting somewhere.

22:46.703 --> 22:47.668
Yeah, we're getting out of here,

22:47.670 --> 22:49.170
because you got no case.

22:49.172 --> 22:50.471
Lenny Ross can go to hell,

22:50.473 --> 22:52.139
and so can both of you.

22:59.549 --> 23:01.882
What's Crystal doing here?

23:01.884 --> 23:04.185
We got her on possession
of Lenny's watch.

23:04.187 --> 23:07.989
She offered it up for a story
about you setting up Lenny.

23:07.991 --> 23:09.924
Well, Crystal's a liar.
She's got a record.

23:09.926 --> 23:12.026
Well, you know how this works.

23:12.028 --> 23:16.097
First one to talk gets the deal.

23:21.170 --> 23:23.471
So basically I'm stuck

23:23.473 --> 23:24.972
with no hope of getting out.

23:24.974 --> 23:26.540
That's not how they put it.

23:26.542 --> 23:27.808
Well, how'd they put it?

23:27.810 --> 23:29.110
That you're too good
at what you're doing

23:29.112 --> 23:30.511
to be reassigned.

23:30.513 --> 23:31.846
So it's a catch22.

23:31.848 --> 23:34.081
Keep doing a good job,
I can't get promoted.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.916
It is what it is.

23:37.520 --> 23:40.087
Let me ask you something, Jamie.

23:40.089 --> 23:42.256
What would you do
if you were me?

23:43.359 --> 23:44.525
I don't know.

23:44.527 --> 23:46.460
Yeah, I guess you don't have to.

23:46.462 --> 23:47.962
'Cause it could never
happen to you.

23:47.964 --> 23:50.164
Because my father's
the police commissioner?

23:50.166 --> 23:51.332
You gonna argue with that?

23:51.334 --> 23:52.500
Only in that it doesn't make me

23:52.502 --> 23:53.768
an example of anything.

23:53.770 --> 23:56.003
I'm in a folder all
my own, I know that.

23:56.005 --> 23:58.572
- Can I give you a piece of advice?
- Sure.

23:58.574 --> 23:59.974
You've got the hardest
sell I've ever heard.

23:59.976 --> 24:01.375
You're indispensable
where you're at,

24:01.377 --> 24:03.644
and yet you want the bosses
to pull you out of there.

24:03.646 --> 24:05.212
Yeah, that's one way
to look at it.

24:05.214 --> 24:06.247
It's the only way
they're gonna look at it.

24:06.249 --> 24:08.849
Then what are my options?

24:11.721 --> 24:12.853
I'm not saying I know.

24:12.855 --> 24:15.489
I'm just painting
a picture of what is.

24:15.491 --> 24:18.859
Thanks for the talk.
Tariq, listen.

24:18.861 --> 24:21.629
You know what me and 99%
of other cops are not,

24:21.631 --> 24:22.430
that you are?

24:22.432 --> 24:24.131
Yeah. Stuck. No.

24:24.133 --> 24:26.133
Indispensable.

24:26.135 --> 24:28.636
Before you chuck it,
at least put some value on it.

24:30.540 --> 24:32.740
Now you're sounding like a boss.

24:32.742 --> 24:36.177
And I don't mean that
as a compliment.

24:47.190 --> 24:49.857
Why do you assume it's bad news?

24:51.194 --> 24:53.994
The corollary to
the favor protocol...

24:53.996 --> 24:55.729
If you gotta give someone
bad news,

24:55.731 --> 24:58.699
go see them so you can
leave right away.

24:58.701 --> 25:01.135
Well, I'd like to give you
the good news first.

25:01.137 --> 25:03.504
Okay.

25:03.506 --> 25:06.841
Your pal was almost
certainly set up.

25:06.843 --> 25:09.043
The arranged meeting was a ploy.

25:09.045 --> 25:11.679
Cardoza Jr. instructed
the bartender

25:11.681 --> 25:14.448
to doctor Lenny's drinks.

25:16.419 --> 25:18.619
That's very good news.

25:18.621 --> 25:19.987
Who sang?

25:19.989 --> 25:21.622
Bartender.

25:21.624 --> 25:23.124
We found out she
already had a record,

25:23.126 --> 25:25.626
so she agreed to roll on Mickey.

25:25.628 --> 25:28.529
So what's the bad news?

25:28.531 --> 25:32.800
When we went to document
that Mickey's father and Lenny

25:32.802 --> 25:34.902
had business back in the day,

25:34.904 --> 25:37.538
there was nothing there.

25:38.875 --> 25:40.808
Well, there was a beef.

25:40.810 --> 25:42.776
What kind of beef
makes the department

25:42.778 --> 25:45.246
delete the records
of someone's service?

25:45.248 --> 25:48.315
Water under the bridge.

25:48.317 --> 25:51.418
Come on, Dad, you asked
for <i>my</i> help here.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.754
I need to understand
what we're looking at.

25:58.728 --> 26:00.861
Sal Cordoza was shaking down
drug dealers

26:00.863 --> 26:03.197
from the day he was
assigned to Narcotics.

26:03.199 --> 26:05.733
He recruited Lenny,
and Lenny joined up.

26:05.735 --> 26:07.668
Lenny was a dirty cop.

26:07.670 --> 26:10.171
No way. No way.

26:10.173 --> 26:12.373
Lenny wore a wire
and turned Sal in.

26:12.375 --> 26:15.609
Why destroy the records
if it was that cut and dry?

26:17.880 --> 26:20.181
Well, word came...

26:20.183 --> 26:22.716
word came down to bury it

26:22.718 --> 26:25.686
and let Cardoza retire.

26:25.688 --> 26:27.988
They covered it up? Why?

26:27.990 --> 26:30.891
Erin, we're talking about
the late '80s,

26:30.893 --> 26:34.862
a year after the Buddy Boys
scandal at the 77.

26:34.864 --> 26:37.565
My guess is One PP
did not have an appetite

26:37.567 --> 26:39.567
for another public flogging.

26:39.569 --> 26:41.335
Pop?

26:41.337 --> 26:44.004
No. Before Pop.

26:44.006 --> 26:48.008
Wow, the bad old days.

26:48.010 --> 26:49.176
Yeah, tell me about it.

26:50.580 --> 26:53.414
What's that movie?

26:53.416 --> 26:55.449
You know, the one where they
invent a ray gun

26:55.451 --> 26:56.650
to erase your memory?

26:57.887 --> 26:59.253
<i>Men in Black?</i>

26:59.255 --> 27:00.454
Yeah, that's it.

27:00.456 --> 27:03.524
I just used one of those on you.

27:09.899 --> 27:13.067
Is he really blaming you
for not getting him reassigned?

27:13.069 --> 27:16.003
Line up single file.
We need a head count.

27:16.005 --> 27:17.972
He's just frustrated, Eddie.
I would be, too.

27:17.974 --> 27:19.873
He's done nothing wrong.

27:21.344 --> 27:23.077
You won't replace us,
Cat Stevens.

27:23.079 --> 27:25.613
We know what you're
really up to.

27:25.615 --> 27:26.580
Sir, give it a rest.

27:26.582 --> 27:27.982
Unbelievable.

27:27.984 --> 27:29.416
You're protecting
the rights of the terrorists

27:29.418 --> 27:31.151
by harassing ordinary
American citizens.

27:31.153 --> 27:32.319
We're not harassing anyone.

27:32.321 --> 27:34.288
We're just trying
to keep everyone safe.

27:34.290 --> 27:36.056
If you want everybody
to feel safe,

27:36.058 --> 27:38.259
you should investigate that guy.

27:38.261 --> 27:40.160
Whatever he is, he's not
who he pretends to be.

27:40.162 --> 27:44.031
Officers, please.
We have an emergency.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.333
What's the matter?
Someone left a backpack on board,

27:46.335 --> 27:48.535
and there's wires
coming out of it

27:48.537 --> 27:50.671
and a timer, like a bomb.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.374
All right, just try
to stay calm,

27:53.376 --> 27:54.408
okay, and we'll take care of it.

27:54.410 --> 27:55.676
Now, you get back.

27:55.678 --> 27:57.578
Eddie, we gotta clear the area

27:57.580 --> 27:58.612
and notify bomb squad. Okay.

27:58.614 --> 28:00.281
Everyone, move back, move back.

28:00.283 --> 28:01.949
Hey, hey, stop.

28:02.852 --> 28:04.385
Hey!

28:04.387 --> 28:06.587
Jamie?

28:08.924 --> 28:11.058
Tariq, what are you doing?

28:11.060 --> 28:12.826
I did two tours in Iraq.

28:12.828 --> 28:14.061
We saw IEDs like this
all the time.

28:14.063 --> 28:15.229
Off the bus, Tariq. Come on.

28:15.231 --> 28:16.397
You don't outrank me, Jamie.

28:16.399 --> 28:17.831
I don't have time
to argue about this.

28:17.833 --> 28:18.932
This thing could
blow up at any second.

28:18.934 --> 28:20.034
We gotta get these
people out of here

28:20.036 --> 28:21.035
and clear the area.

28:21.037 --> 28:23.070
We might not have enough time.

28:41.021 --> 28:43.121
OOkay, okay.

28:45.103 --> 28:46.403
Here.

28:46.405 --> 28:47.537
They got it rigged
so that we can't tell

28:47.539 --> 28:48.738
how much time we have left.

28:51.209 --> 28:53.576
Just trying to figure out
these firing circuits.

28:53.578 --> 28:56.212
You never told me you did
bomb disposal in Iraq.

28:56.214 --> 28:58.982
I didn't. I just said that I saw
bombs that looked like this.

28:58.984 --> 29:00.650
How do you know
which wire to cut?

29:00.652 --> 29:01.718
Just trying to make
an educated guess.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.786
Tariq, listen, I got this.

29:02.788 --> 29:04.120
Come on. Let's go.

29:04.122 --> 29:05.855
No way, my brother.

29:05.857 --> 29:07.257
I signed on for this.

29:12.264 --> 29:15.465
Green means go,
red means stop, right?

29:15.467 --> 29:17.267
Unless it's the other way
around, yeah.

29:52.404 --> 29:54.571
Come on.

30:00.912 --> 30:02.645
All right, say something
so we can make sure

30:02.647 --> 30:03.780
the Bluetooth's working.

30:03.782 --> 30:07.650
I hope that's sweat
running down my leg.

30:07.652 --> 30:10.120
Brilliant. You getting that?

30:10.122 --> 30:11.721
All right. You understand what

30:11.723 --> 30:12.889
has to be done in there, right?

30:12.891 --> 30:14.224
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:14.226 --> 30:16.266
Get 'em talking on the wire
about the gun shipments.

30:16.552 --> 30:18.329
And let me take the lead
guiding the conversation.

30:18.330 --> 30:21.031
What? Why?

30:21.033 --> 30:23.333
For your protection.

30:23.335 --> 30:25.101
In other words,
so you don't screw it up

30:25.103 --> 30:26.636
by doing something stupid.

30:29.741 --> 30:31.674
Danny, can I talk
to you for a second?

30:31.676 --> 30:33.443
Alone?

30:34.413 --> 30:36.813
All right.

30:37.883 --> 30:39.783
What now?

30:39.785 --> 30:41.718
Danny, I know these guys.

30:41.720 --> 30:43.686
They're not gonna believe
that she's my girlfriend.

30:43.688 --> 30:46.122
And they sure as hell ain't
gonna like her taking the lead.

30:46.124 --> 30:49.292
You're not flying solo. No way.

30:49.294 --> 30:50.927
Danny, I don't need
a babysitter.

30:50.929 --> 30:52.796
In fact, the only way
this thing goes down

30:52.798 --> 30:54.397
is if I go in on my own.

30:54.399 --> 30:55.932
So I'm supposed
to just trust you?

30:55.934 --> 30:57.600
After everything
that's happened?

30:57.602 --> 30:59.202
After everything you've done?

30:59.204 --> 31:01.538
Danny, we go way back,
you and me.

31:01.540 --> 31:03.006
I know I messed up with you.

31:03.008 --> 31:05.642
That's an understatement.

31:05.644 --> 31:08.545
I feel bad,

31:08.547 --> 31:12.749
the way I left things
with Linda... and you.

31:12.751 --> 31:16.453
Please, give me a chance to show

31:16.455 --> 31:19.656
that that's not all that I am.

31:23.428 --> 31:25.528
It goes bad in there,
what do you do?

31:25.530 --> 31:27.797
I say the word "flush,"
you bring in the ghosts.

31:27.799 --> 31:29.899
I got this, Danny.

31:29.901 --> 31:31.668
I won't let you down.

31:31.670 --> 31:33.269
Well, you better not.

31:33.271 --> 31:34.571
Because if you do,

31:34.573 --> 31:36.639
I will make it my life's mission

31:36.641 --> 31:40.877
to see to it that you never draw
another breath as a free man.

31:42.214 --> 31:45.248
Now go on and act like
you're having a good time.

31:45.250 --> 31:47.283
All right.

31:57.496 --> 31:59.863
I feel like I'm Donnie Brasco.

32:11.042 --> 32:12.175
What's up, guys?

32:12.177 --> 32:13.977
Hey. There he is.

32:13.979 --> 32:15.879
King of plastic.
Sit down, Jimmy.

32:15.881 --> 32:17.714
What do you got for us?

32:19.918 --> 32:22.952
Pick a card, any card.

32:22.954 --> 32:24.320
They're beautiful.

32:25.824 --> 32:27.557
You know, the oldtime wise guys

32:27.559 --> 32:29.993
used to call these "muldoons"

32:29.995 --> 32:32.162
because liquor always taste
better on a muldoon.

32:33.965 --> 32:36.232
Sweetheart,
champagne for the table.

32:40.805 --> 32:42.071
How's he doing in there, Baez?

32:42.073 --> 32:43.573
So far, so good.

32:43.575 --> 32:44.941
No one's got a hand cut off yet.

32:44.943 --> 32:46.376
Just keep an eye on him.

32:46.378 --> 32:48.645
He's still family.

32:52.717 --> 32:55.451
So what are you guys gonna use
these cards for this time?

32:58.990 --> 33:00.757
What's it to you, Jimmy?

33:00.759 --> 33:03.393
Just curious.

33:07.832 --> 33:08.998
What are you doing?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.568
I got this for when
I get nervous.

33:11.570 --> 33:15.872
It's one of these new
Bluetooth doohickeys.

33:15.874 --> 33:18.208
Tells me if someone's
transmitting from my area.

33:18.210 --> 33:21.110
Would you look at that?

33:21.112 --> 33:23.446
Who's "Lindabro"?

33:26.618 --> 33:28.318
Beats me.

33:29.988 --> 33:31.821
Thought you had
a sister named Linda

33:31.823 --> 33:34.591
you used to set up
one of the cards.

33:36.628 --> 33:38.761
Looks like we have a problem.

33:42.100 --> 33:44.701
Hey, you guys don't want
to flush this whole deal

33:44.703 --> 33:46.836
down the toilet
over this, do you?

33:48.506 --> 33:51.474
He's been made. Go, go!

33:51.476 --> 33:53.876
Get out of the way. Go. Move.

33:55.847 --> 33:58.281
Out of the way, folks,
out of the way!

33:58.283 --> 34:00.950
Police! Move!
Get out of the way!

34:00.952 --> 34:02.352
Go! Get outside.

34:02.354 --> 34:04.187
Baez! Hey, you okay?

34:04.189 --> 34:05.455
Yeah, I just got grazed.

34:05.457 --> 34:07.690
They grabbed Jimmy and they
took him back that way.

34:07.692 --> 34:09.958
They're both armed.
Okay. You stay with her.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.228
You, on me. Come on. Go.
Get outside. Go.

34:13.231 --> 34:15.164
Jimmy!

34:15.166 --> 34:16.966
Get out.

34:16.967 --> 34:19.735
Go. Hurry up.

34:23.174 --> 34:24.407
Get back.

34:24.409 --> 34:25.475
Grab that.

34:25.476 --> 34:27.143
Cover him.

34:27.145 --> 34:28.511
Jimmy!

34:28.513 --> 34:31.681
Is that you, Danny?

34:35.219 --> 34:37.286
What the hell happened here?

34:37.289 --> 34:40.123
Snap out of it! What happened?

34:40.125 --> 34:43.192
You shoot both these guys?

34:43.194 --> 34:44.761
I guess I did.

34:44.763 --> 34:47.597
You got the jump on 'em both?

34:47.599 --> 34:48.965
I did good, right, Danny?

34:48.967 --> 34:51.333
Yeah, you did great. Now get
your finger off the trigger.

34:52.137 --> 34:53.603
Yeah.

34:57.342 --> 34:59.582
Let's go. Get out of here.

35:03.581 --> 35:05.181
<i>Okay, Jimmy</i>

35:05.183 --> 35:06.282
was a friend.

35:06.284 --> 35:07.784
No, he's an acquaintance.

35:07.786 --> 35:09.619
The person who introduces you

35:09.621 --> 35:10.753
to the person you marry

35:10.755 --> 35:12.422
is automatically
upgraded to friend.

35:12.424 --> 35:13.656
No, they are not.

35:13.658 --> 35:14.824
Brotherinlaw, yes.

35:14.826 --> 35:16.392
Pain in my ass, yes.

35:16.394 --> 35:17.293
Grace. But...

35:17.295 --> 35:18.628
Albatross around my neck,

35:18.630 --> 35:19.862
no thanks.

35:19.864 --> 35:21.431
Grace.

35:21.433 --> 35:22.532
It's your turn.

35:22.534 --> 35:25.068
Okay.

35:25.070 --> 35:26.302
Bless us, O Lord,

35:26.304 --> 35:28.204
and these Thy gifts
which we are about to receive...

35:28.206 --> 35:29.372
From Thy bounty.

35:29.374 --> 35:30.673
Through Christ our Lord...

35:30.675 --> 35:32.041
And when a friend becomes

35:32.043 --> 35:33.376
a life sentence, they cease

35:33.378 --> 35:36.546
being a friend, especially
a Judas like Jimmy. Amen.

35:36.548 --> 35:38.748
I'm not sure that
qualifies as grace.

35:38.750 --> 35:41.551
- Pope Francis okayed it.
- What?

35:41.553 --> 35:43.386
Yeah, ushering the church into
the new fastpaced modern times.

35:43.388 --> 35:44.554
Really? Yeah.

35:44.556 --> 35:47.023
- No.
- You can still be friends with someone

35:47.025 --> 35:49.092
without buying into their
illusions about themselves.

35:49.094 --> 35:51.294
Did you say that
or is that a quote?

35:51.296 --> 35:52.862
I don't know, but it rings true.

35:52.864 --> 35:55.164
Especially with friends
like Uncle Lenny.

35:55.166 --> 35:56.599
Yeah, that comes in handy.

35:56.601 --> 35:57.867
Or a guy like Tariq.

35:57.869 --> 35:59.369
Who's Tariq? The cop
you were with on the bus?

35:59.371 --> 36:01.003
Yeah, even when I met him
back in academy...

36:01.005 --> 36:02.105
And I went out of my way

36:02.107 --> 36:03.573
because he was the
only Muslim in our class,

36:03.575 --> 36:04.874
he had a chip on his shoulder.

36:04.876 --> 36:07.009
Being the only Muslim,
he probably earned that chip.

36:07.011 --> 36:08.277
Standing out all the time.

36:08.279 --> 36:09.846
But there's a limit,
there's a time you go,

36:09.848 --> 36:11.748
"Man, how many times you
gonna play that same card?"

36:11.750 --> 36:12.882
I don't know if you can

36:12.884 --> 36:13.983
set that limit

36:13.985 --> 36:15.251
unless you've been dealt
that hand.

36:15.253 --> 36:17.520
All right, you got a point.

36:17.522 --> 36:19.322
I'll say it again,

36:19.324 --> 36:21.724
if your friends
have to be perfect,

36:21.726 --> 36:23.659
you won't have
any friends because...

36:23.661 --> 36:26.095
Nobody's perfect.

36:26.097 --> 36:27.797
Plus he's Uncle Jimmy,

36:27.799 --> 36:30.233
means he's family,
means you have to forgive him.

36:30.235 --> 36:31.934
Yeah, no.

36:31.936 --> 36:33.302
No, thanks.

36:33.304 --> 36:35.238
- Not a choice.
- Sure it is.

36:35.240 --> 36:37.807
He betrayed Danny
on about five different levels.

36:37.809 --> 36:39.475
At least. Thank you, Dad.

36:39.477 --> 36:41.978
But I do think
you need to be careful

36:41.980 --> 36:44.881
when you draw those lines;
Who stays and who goes.

36:44.883 --> 36:49.318
The supply of new friends goes
down to a trickle as you age up,

36:49.320 --> 36:52.588
and a new old friend

36:52.590 --> 36:54.657
is an oxymoron.

36:54.659 --> 36:56.292
A great depression.

36:56.294 --> 36:57.627
Jumbo shrimp.

36:57.629 --> 36:58.995
House Intelligence Committee.

36:58.997 --> 37:00.363
Unbiased opinion.

37:00.365 --> 37:03.299
I get it. I get it.

37:08.406 --> 37:10.640
Aw, thanks.

37:10.642 --> 37:13.109
Tariq, hey.

37:13.111 --> 37:13.834
What's up?

37:13.858 --> 37:15.579
I just wanted to stop by
and say thanks.

37:15.580 --> 37:18.347
For what?

37:18.349 --> 37:19.715
I just got the call.

37:19.717 --> 37:21.584
They're taking me off
the undercover assignment

37:21.586 --> 37:24.320
at the mosque and putting me on
the Joint Terrorist Task Force

37:24.322 --> 37:25.822
as a detective.

37:25.824 --> 37:27.657
All right.

37:27.659 --> 37:29.692
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

37:29.694 --> 37:31.594
Congratulations.

37:31.596 --> 37:33.563
And thanks for putting in
a good word, Jamie.

37:33.565 --> 37:35.097
It wasn't to do with me.

37:35.099 --> 37:36.532
You got it strictly
on the merits.

37:36.534 --> 37:37.900
Really?

37:37.902 --> 37:40.736
Really. I never even
picked up the phone.

37:40.738 --> 37:43.873
But then why...

37:43.875 --> 37:46.609
I guess sometimes things
just work out the right way.

37:46.611 --> 37:49.312
I mean, look at this.

37:49.314 --> 37:51.280
I'm the one with the hook,
and I'm still in the bag.

37:51.282 --> 37:53.716
And you're the one
getting the Gold Shield.

37:53.718 --> 37:55.718
Well, then, thanks for staying
on the bus with me

37:55.720 --> 37:57.186
when you didn't have to.

38:20.879 --> 38:22.278
Riding shotgun now?

38:22.280 --> 38:25.848
I'm the Police Commissioner,
I can sit anywhere I want.

38:25.850 --> 38:27.617
You owe me.

38:27.619 --> 38:30.152
That was, after all,
evidence in the Cardoza case.

38:30.154 --> 38:32.522
I pulled some strings.
Don't ask.

38:32.524 --> 38:34.323
I swear to God, I feel like
I'm walking around

38:34.325 --> 38:36.893
with a part of me missing
these last few days. Thank you.

38:36.895 --> 38:38.127
You're welcome.

38:38.129 --> 38:39.328
So what if it's hot?

38:39.330 --> 38:41.330
It's the thought that counts.

38:45.069 --> 38:47.703
Lenny, there is one more thing.

38:47.705 --> 38:48.905
No, no. No more things, Frank.

38:48.907 --> 38:51.607
No. When the investigators
dug deep to find

38:51.609 --> 38:53.609
the vendetta, they
found something else.

38:53.611 --> 38:54.644
What's that?

38:54.646 --> 38:56.512
The gun you had on you?

38:56.514 --> 38:59.515
You let your New York
carry permit lapse.

39:01.252 --> 39:02.451
Misdemeanor?

39:02.453 --> 39:03.886
Come on.

39:03.888 --> 39:06.622
It's gonna pop with the
Florida state Liquor Authority.

39:06.624 --> 39:08.858
You can't run a restaurant
without a liquor license.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.060
True that.

39:13.698 --> 39:16.899
Let me guess.

39:16.901 --> 39:19.001
Who has never picked up a check

39:19.003 --> 39:21.103
at one of Lenny Ross's
restaurants?

39:21.105 --> 39:23.372
His friends at the
State Liquor Authority.

39:29.948 --> 39:31.347
Love you, Lenny.

39:31.349 --> 39:34.050
I love you, too, Frank.
Thank you.

39:34.052 --> 39:35.318
Fly safe.

39:35.320 --> 39:36.819
I'll see you.

39:36.821 --> 39:40.156
Not if I see you first.
