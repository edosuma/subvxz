NIGHT MORNING WHEN MAN-ARCTICA,

19:36.383 --> 19:37.634
THE SUBZERO SUPERHERO,
FLIES IN.

19:37.718 --> 19:38.927
- WHAT?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.014
MAN-ARCTICA COMES HERE?

19:42.097 --> 19:45.559
- YEAH, BUT ONLY
TO GIVE ME SUPERPOWERS.

19:45.642 --> 19:46.602
THEN I USUALLY HELP HIM
PROTECT THE UNIVERSE,

19:46.685 --> 19:48.854
TIME PERMITTING.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.814

19:50.898 --> 19:55.944
MAN-ARCTICA!

19:56.028 --> 19:58.030

20:11.960 --> 20:15.213
DELIVERING TOYS TO ALL
THE GOOD LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS.

20:15.297 --> 20:17.549

20:17.633 --> 20:18.800

20:35.067 --> 20:37.778

20:37.861 --> 20:40.155
- WOW, THAT JUST MEANS

20:40.238 --> 20:43.450

20:54.836 --> 21:00.259
[snoring]

21:00.342 --> 21:01.969

21:02.052 --> 21:07.849

IT'S MILK AND COOKIES!

21:10.686 --> 21:12.688

21:20.570 --> 21:22.447

21:22.531 --> 21:24.908
MORE THAN A SNO-CONE
ON THE FROZEN TUNDRA,

21:24.992 --> 21:27.244
IT'S MILK AND COOKIES.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.870
BUT NOT COOKIES AND MILK.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.331
I GOT SO SICK ON THAT
