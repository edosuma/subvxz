[laughing]
Cousin, I’m sorry

01:26.352 --> 01:27.754
I‐I don’t mean to laugh at you

01:27.788 --> 01:30.256
but you’ve got to admit,
it’s kinda peculiar.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.326
We’ve gone for a nice
Chinese lunch at Wong‐Su’s

01:33.359 --> 01:34.728
and you make a fool of yourself

01:34.761 --> 01:37.764
in front of Wong
and his lovely wife, Su.

01:37.798 --> 01:41.668
Why? All because of the fortune
in the fortune cookie.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.605
Don’t you know them things
can apply to anyone?

01:44.638 --> 01:46.673
Oh, really? Oh, really?

you won’t be using it for tips."

01:57.851 --> 02:00.654
Appleton, Bartokomus,
I want to talk to you.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.423
The theme of next Sunday’s
magazine section is, children

02:03.456 --> 02:05.358
and I want a new
Dimitri cartoon for the cover.

02:07.594 --> 02:09.429
Dimitri is going to be
a cover sheep?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.899
You know,
his dream is to be named

02:12.933 --> 02:15.435
"People" magazine’s
Sexiest Lamb Alive.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.340
Well, I have to meet
with the lawyers.

02:20.373 --> 02:22.676
You remember Rob Bob Phillips,
who used to work up here?

02:22.709 --> 02:24.911
He’s suing the paper
because we fired him.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.713
Appleton...

02:26.747 --> 02:28.381
...if I ever fire you

02:28.414 --> 02:31.384
don’t make
a federal case out of it.

02:31.417 --> 02:32.485
You can count on me, sir.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.554
And have the cover cartoon

02:33.587 --> 02:34.888
on my desk Monday morning.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.627
Now, Balki, Mr. Wainwright says

02:40.661 --> 02:43.597
we have to have the cartoon
on his desk by Monday morning.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.931
So maybe you should just skip

02:44.965 --> 02:46.567
your warm up routine
and get right to the drawing.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.434

‐Skip your warm up routine.

‐Okay, do your warm up.
‐Okay.

Good, good, okay, here we go.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.692
Let’s get right to drawing.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.928
And now, I have to spell my name
in the air with my nose.

03:14.961 --> 03:18.498
B‐A‐...

03:18.532 --> 03:22.569

Wow!

03:24.838 --> 03:25.906
‐Okay, alright.
‐Yeah!

03:25.939 --> 03:26.973
‐Ready?
‐Yeah!

03:27.007 --> 03:28.441
Let’s get right to drawing.

03:28.474 --> 03:30.310
Okay, Dimitri, let’s...

03:31.812 --> 03:33.413
Where’s Dimitri?

03:33.446 --> 03:34.615
I don’t know,
we’ll look for him later.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.016
Let’s‐let’s just
get right to drawing.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.585
Cousin, cousin,
you know I cannot draw Dimitri

03:38.619 --> 03:39.986
unless I have him
right in front of me.

03:40.020 --> 03:43.657
I‐I have to...connect with him.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.425
And‐and I don’t know
where he is.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.761
He‐he’s usually right here
on the corner of my desk

03:47.794 --> 03:49.429
right where this note is.

I’ll be in touch."

04:04.711 --> 04:05.946
You know,
I‐I can’t help noticing

04:05.979 --> 04:07.781
what the tremendous amount
of work

04:07.814 --> 04:09.683
went into the writing
of this note.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.819
Obviously,
the person who sent it

04:12.853 --> 04:15.321
cares enough
to send the very best.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.959
I wonder where Dimitri is.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.827
Balki...

04:20.861 --> 04:22.763
...Dimitri has been kidnapped!

04:26.767 --> 04:29.703
[instrumental music]

04:32.338 --> 04:36.710
I‐I put "Missing Sheep" posters
all over the neighborhood.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.079
‐Did the kidnapper call yet?
‐No, he hasn’t, Balki.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.582
Oh, cousin, I‐I don’t know
what else I can do, I...

04:41.615 --> 04:44.985
I‐I dusted my drawing table
for fingerprints.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.488
I, I faxed Dimitri’s picture
to "Unsolved Mysteries."

04:51.057 --> 04:52.458
I‐I just thought and thought,
I don’t know

04:52.492 --> 04:53.960
what else I could do.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.696
What kind of a person
could do this?

04:55.729 --> 04:57.898
‐I‐I am emotionally drained.
‐Yeah, well.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.801
Of course you are.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.803
I will not cry.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.541
Balki, you know, maybe,
maybe you should do something

05:07.574 --> 05:10.476
uh, that would
take your mind off Dimitri.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.345
Oh, cousin,
that would be so good.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.815
‐Well, of course, it would be.
‐Oh, gosh.

05:14.848 --> 05:15.982
But what could you do?

05:16.016 --> 05:17.050
What could I do?

05:17.083 --> 05:19.586
I’ve got it! You could draw!

05:19.620 --> 05:20.887
What could I do?

05:22.589 --> 05:24.357
I said I’ve got it.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.459
You could draw.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.528
I could draw!

05:27.561 --> 05:30.430
You could draw!

05:30.463 --> 05:32.966
‐Yes.
‐Yes, but what could you draw?

05:32.999 --> 05:36.136
‐What could I draw?
‐What could you draw?

05:36.169 --> 05:38.839
I’ve got it, you could draw
a nice fluffy white cloud.

You could draw

05:50.884 --> 05:54.020
I could draw
a nice fluffy white cloud.

‐Nice fluffy white cloud.
‐No, I don’t dare.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.558
Oh, no, no, go ahead,
go ahead, go ahead.

‐And I feel so much better.
‐Okay.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.630
Okay, give him some eyes, maybe.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.866
You know, just some eyes.
A little nose.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.801
Little nose.
And maybe a tail over here.

‐But, but, but the mouth?
‐Okay.

‐There.
‐Oh, yes.

That’s so very very good.

Yes, you know
what’s really nice about it

06:16.510 --> 06:18.011
I’ve just figured out
what you’re doing.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.647
You’re trying to trick me into
drawing Dimitri, aren’t you?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.749
You take that,
that is low, cousin

06:22.783 --> 06:24.718
that’s low, even for you.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.825
Hi, guys. I got the mail.

06:31.858 --> 06:33.927
Oh, maybe there’s something
from the kidnapper.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.462
Balki,
we are running out of time.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.831
We have got to have that cartoon

06:37.864 --> 06:39.800
on Mr. Wainwright’s desk
by Monday morning.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.736
What is this?

06:43.770 --> 06:45.071
It’s Dimitri’s ear.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.711
Balki, that’s a fabric swatch
I ordered.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.478
I’m getting new drapes
for our bedroom.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.155
What’s this?

07:02.188 --> 07:04.558
Isn’t that one of your
"Think And Grow Taller" tapes?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.830
No.

into 10,000 Q‐tips.’

’You catch my drift?’

’I’ll contact you
within 24 hours.’

[instrumental music]

07:57.911 --> 08:00.046
‐Hi, Balki.
‐Hello.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.715
‐What’s all this stuff?
‐Hi, Mary Anne.

08:01.748 --> 08:02.983
The, uh, kidnapper called.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.019
He wants $10,000 ransom
for Dimitri

08:06.052 --> 08:09.289
and he said he’s,
he said he’s calling today

08:09.322 --> 08:11.157
so I’m just rounding up
some things to sell

08:11.191 --> 08:13.259
to get the ransom money.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.761
[gasps]
Balki!

08:15.862 --> 08:17.664
This is my hair dryer!

08:19.265 --> 08:21.768
Well, I‐I‐I know
that’s your hair dryer

08:21.802 --> 08:23.837
but I was hoping
that you would donate it

08:23.870 --> 08:25.672
to Dimitri’s ransom fund.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.676
Um, unless it’s
a priceless family heirloom

08:29.710 --> 08:31.878
lovingly handed down
from mother to daughter

08:31.912 --> 08:34.179
every generation, for years back

08:34.214 --> 08:35.948
since your family
first come to this country

08:35.982 --> 08:37.317
and therefore much much more

08:37.350 --> 08:40.186
important than Dimitri’s life.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.955
How could I be so heartless?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.659
Keep the dryer.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.561
I’ll get you my facial sauna.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.933
Balki!

08:52.966 --> 08:55.335
Incredible news!

08:55.368 --> 08:58.071
You’ll never guess what I found
in the trash dumpster

08:58.104 --> 09:00.674
outside behind the Chronicle.
What are you doing?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.275
Get... Stop it!

09:02.308 --> 09:03.810
Balki.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.212
I found...Dimitri.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.914
Oh! Cousin!

09:09.616 --> 09:11.585
Now we are so happy,
we do the dance of joy.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.620
[chattering]

09:13.654 --> 09:15.589
Good idea. Good idea.
Good idea. Good idea.

09:15.622 --> 09:19.092
But first, first we draw,
then we dance.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.066
Cousin, cousin,
why can’t I hold Dimitri?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.167
Oh, well, Balki, uh,
Dimitri’s been through

09:27.200 --> 09:28.268
a traumatic experience

09:28.301 --> 09:31.004
and he needs
to spend some time alone.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.173
But, but, cousin,
I, but the thing is, I‐I

09:33.206 --> 09:36.109
yesterday he wanted
$10,000 for Dimitri

09:36.142 --> 09:37.644
and‐and
why he did change his mind?

09:37.678 --> 09:40.180
Well, uh, maybe somebody
saw him with Dimitri

09:40.213 --> 09:42.649
and, and, and so he had to get
rid of the evidence

09:42.683 --> 09:45.051
but the important thing is,
Dimitri is here

09:45.085 --> 09:47.353
and now we can get that cartoon

09:47.387 --> 09:49.956
to Mr. Wainwright
by Monday morning.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.794
Okay, now, here we go.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.029
Do your warm up.
Five finger push‐ups.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.097
‐Five finger push‐ups, ready
‐Cousin, co‐cousin, cousin...

09:57.130 --> 10:00.233
One...two...three, four, five.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.135
Okay, good, good, good.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.637
‐Okay, here we go.
‐Argh!

10:03.670 --> 10:05.271
We’re going to write your name

10:05.305 --> 10:08.141
in the air with your nose, okay?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.643
‐B!
‐Oww! Oww!

10:09.676 --> 10:11.044
‐A!
‐Oww! Oww!

10:11.077 --> 10:14.147
‐L! K!
‐Cousin!

10:14.180 --> 10:16.016
Cousin! Cousin!

10:16.049 --> 10:17.851
I always write my name
with capitals.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.219
You using lowercase.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.659
‐Sorry.
‐No, that’s alright.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.193
‐Okay, here we go.
‐Oww!

‐B!
‐Oww!

10:28.428 --> 10:30.063
‐A!
‐Oww! Oww! Aah!

10:30.096 --> 10:31.264
‐L!
‐Oww! Cous...

10:31.297 --> 10:32.699
‐K!
‐Cousin! Oww!

10:32.733 --> 10:34.701
‐I!
‐Oww!

10:34.735 --> 10:37.370
Why does it have
to hurt so much?

10:39.439 --> 10:40.841
Just be glad
you don’t have a longer name.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.343
Okay, here we go!

10:43.376 --> 10:45.411
‐Alright, we’re going to‐‐
‐Ah‐ha!

10:45.445 --> 10:47.681
You wait
just a cotton candy minute.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.819
Dimitri was made of pure wool

10:52.853 --> 10:56.089
and this little imitation
is made of some synthetic fiber.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.390
Uh‐uh‐uh...

10:57.423 --> 11:02.028
Cousin, my little friend Dimitri
was not 32% rayon.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.163
This is not Dimitri.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.299
This is some puny
polyester imposter.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.935
Now, Balki, Balki,
of course it’s Dimitri.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.971
I‐if it wasn’t Dimitri,
how do you explain that

11:11.004 --> 11:12.072
that when I walked
by the dumpster

11:12.105 --> 11:13.306
he was, he was calling my name.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.910
[bleating]
Cousin Larry! Cousin Larry!

11:21.181 --> 11:22.448
Get a grip.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.120
This is a stuffed sheep.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.724
Alright, alright,
maybe it’s not Dimitri!

11:30.757 --> 11:32.793
[panting]
But‐but
if you don’t draw Dimitri

11:32.826 --> 11:34.360
Mr. Wainwright
is going to fire us.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.764
Cousin, look, I‐I,
I don’t know how to say this.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.265
I cannot draw Dimitri

11:39.299 --> 11:42.035
unless I have Dimitri
in front of me.

11:42.068 --> 11:44.037
It’s like,
you cannot take a pill

11:44.070 --> 11:46.106
unless Jennifer
hides it in apple sauce.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.110
I‐I’m sorry.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.978
Okay. Okay.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.915
[sighs]
If you can’t draw Dimitri

11:54.948 --> 11:56.482
unless Dimitri’s here

11:56.517 --> 11:58.418
we’ll just have to
get Dimitri back.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.987
But, cousin,
we cannot afford the‐the ransom.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.188
Balki, forget the ransom.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.224
We are gonna catch
the kidnapper.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.462
Now, what we have to do
is to get him to meet us

12:09.495 --> 12:11.765
in a place
where we have the advantage.

12:11.798 --> 12:14.801
I’ve got it, cousin.
The jungle gym down at the park.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.903
I know that thing inside out.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.205
It’ll never work.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.974
How about the market?

12:21.007 --> 12:22.042
What advantage
will we have there?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.143
None, but we need milk.

12:24.545 --> 12:26.112
[telephone ringing]

12:27.480 --> 12:28.849
Hello!

12:28.882 --> 12:31.017
Yes, this is Balki Bartokomous.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.053
Cousin,
it’s the man who has Dimitri.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.188
Listen, listen, l‐he‐he‐he likes

12:35.221 --> 12:36.422
to be scratched behind the ears

12:36.456 --> 12:38.358
and, and he likes to sleep
on his left side

12:38.391 --> 12:39.926
and he has lived...

12:39.960 --> 12:41.494
Yes, I know
he’s just a stuffed animal

12:41.528 --> 12:43.897
but I’ve been under
tremendous emotional strain!

12:43.930 --> 12:45.331
Please indulge me!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.069
Balki, if we’re going
to get Dimitri back

12:49.102 --> 12:51.404
we’re gonna have to get tough.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.206
Alright, listen, pally!

12:55.008 --> 12:56.510
Listen and listen up good.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.179
We’ve got your $10,000,
but we’re not gonna meet you

12:59.212 --> 13:02.148
in some dark dangerous alley!

13:04.017 --> 13:06.286
No! Shut up! Don’t talk!

13:06.319 --> 13:08.889
We’ll meet you tonight
at midnight

13:08.922 --> 13:12.058
in the, in the
the basement of the Chronicle.

13:12.092 --> 13:15.295
A‐and bring the sheep!

13:15.328 --> 13:17.964
And that goes
double for me, pally!

13:21.467 --> 13:23.469
[intense music]

13:33.446 --> 13:36.216
Balki, help me
spread out these marbles.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.919
Uh... Cousin, you know,
I, I love playing marbles

13:38.952 --> 13:41.287
just as much
as anyone else but...

13:41.321 --> 13:43.890
...now it seems
kind of an odd time.

13:45.926 --> 13:46.993
I don’t know how you play

13:47.027 --> 13:48.428
but you know
what we do on Mypos?

13:48.461 --> 13:51.397
We put all the marbles
in our mouth

13:51.431 --> 13:53.366
and then...we’ll see

13:53.399 --> 13:55.569
who can spit them the farthest.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.314
Balki,
we are not playing marbles.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.554
We are setting a trap
for the kidnapper.

14:13.587 --> 14:14.888
Well...

14:14.921 --> 14:17.423
Now, when he comes in

14:17.457 --> 14:19.025
he’ll step on the marbles.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.162
When he falls,
that’s when we jump him. Okay?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.197
It’s almost midnight.
Hit the lights.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.978
Cousin.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.615
What are you thinking?

14:45.351 --> 14:47.087
I was just thinking...

14:48.655 --> 14:51.091
...that I’m waiting
here in the dark...

14:52.425 --> 14:55.395
...for someone deranged enough

14:55.428 --> 14:57.664
to kidnap a stuffed sheep.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.303
And therefore, probably

15:03.336 --> 15:06.172
deranged enough to be carrying

15:06.206 --> 15:09.009
one of those
automatic assault rifles.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.648
And I’m doing this...

15:14.681 --> 15:17.450
...so I can fill in a bubble...

15:17.483 --> 15:19.319
...over a cartoon...

15:21.555 --> 15:24.991
...to please my boss...

15:25.025 --> 15:27.360
...who thinks
I’m a babbling twit.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.067
Maybe I should
re‐examine my life.

15:36.637 --> 15:38.539
You want to know
what I’m thinking?

15:41.407 --> 15:42.609
No.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.753
[footsteps approaching]

15:52.786 --> 15:54.755
[gasps]
Cousin, someone’s coming.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.156
It’s the kidnapper.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.624
Alright, alright, when he falls

15:57.658 --> 15:59.459
that’s when we jump him.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.162
[intense music]

16:02.195 --> 16:03.329
Now!

16:05.498 --> 16:07.100
[screaming]

16:11.304 --> 16:14.040
Cousin, it’s Miss Lydia.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.409
Boy, you think
you know a person.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.113
What are you two doing here?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.281
[groaning]

16:21.314 --> 16:23.283
Miss Lydia, Miss Lydia

16:23.316 --> 16:25.185
you, you have kidnapped Dimitri

16:25.218 --> 16:27.654
and you’re here
to collect the ransom money.

16:27.688 --> 16:30.156
I love you, Miss Lydia,
but you have thrown me into

16:30.190 --> 16:32.593
a terrible emotional conflict!

16:32.626 --> 16:34.494
You have done a horrible thing!

16:34.528 --> 16:35.395
But I want you to know

16:35.428 --> 16:37.698
that I am going
to do everything I can

16:37.731 --> 16:39.265
to help you become once again

16:39.299 --> 16:41.167
a useful member of society.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.369
Cousin, get her out of my sight.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.439
I didn’t steal your sheep.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.208
I don’t even eat lamb.

16:49.475 --> 16:51.211
Balki!

16:51.244 --> 16:53.213
It wasn’t Lydia.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.215
It was a man’s voice
on the phone.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.083
Oh, never mind.

16:58.819 --> 17:00.120
I‐I‐I‐I’m sorry, Lydia

17:00.153 --> 17:01.688
a‐all this Dimitri stuff

17:01.722 --> 17:03.323
has gotten us a little tense.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.026
Oh, shame on you!

17:17.570 --> 17:19.573
False alarm. Come on.

17:19.606 --> 17:20.773
‐Watch your step.
‐Watch it. Yeah.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.308
You be... Hit the lights.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.448
[intense music]

17:32.653 --> 17:35.288
[footsteps approaching]

17:35.321 --> 17:36.657
Hey! Balki!

17:36.690 --> 17:38.291
This is it!

17:41.394 --> 17:42.596
Now!

17:44.665 --> 17:45.732
[screaming]

17:49.169 --> 17:52.438
Cousin, it’s Mr. Gorpley.

17:52.472 --> 17:55.241
Boy, you think
you know a person.

17:57.678 --> 17:59.179
Do you ever think maybe you two

17:59.212 --> 18:01.147
spend too much time together?

18:02.616 --> 18:05.519
Mr. Gorpley,
why didn’t you come to me?

18:05.552 --> 18:08.488
We could’ve talked this over.
I‐I thought we were friends.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.557
Hey! It’s Balki.

18:12.926 --> 18:16.196
Balki, that’s not why
Gorpley is here.

18:19.365 --> 18:20.867
Lydia’s upstairs.

18:20.901 --> 18:23.469
Oh, she is? Oh.

18:23.504 --> 18:26.239
Well, maybe
I’ll just stop up and say hi.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.148
Hit the lights. Watch out.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.382
‐Careful. Yeah.
‐You be careful.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.417
Easy, cousin.

18:43.489 --> 18:44.424
How long do you think

18:44.457 --> 18:47.293
this parade
of innocent people will go on?

18:51.932 --> 18:53.499
I don’t know, Balki

18:53.534 --> 18:55.769
but when this monster shows up

18:55.802 --> 18:57.403
we’re gonna be ready for him.

18:58.605 --> 18:59.806
‐Ah‐ha!
‐Aah!

19:01.975 --> 19:03.544
Rob Bob!

19:03.577 --> 19:04.578
Rob Bob, how are you?

19:04.611 --> 19:06.613
Oh, I‐I’m just fine,
thank you, I’m fine.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.849
Cousin Larry, look,
this is Rob Bob Phillips.

19:08.882 --> 19:10.183
He used to work here.

19:10.216 --> 19:11.217
Well, get down, Rob Bob

19:11.251 --> 19:13.219
because we’re waiting
to catch a kidnapper.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.388
‐Uh, Larry, Balki‐‐
‐Balki, hit the lights.

19:16.957 --> 19:19.726
[intense music]

19:19.760 --> 19:21.194
I’m the kidnapper.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.700
Balki, hit the lights.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.836
I’m sorry
to put you through so much.

19:29.870 --> 19:32.238
I know it was hard on you.

19:32.272 --> 19:35.576
‐Here’s Dimitri.
‐Oh, Dimitri, Dimitri.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.811
I took real good care of him.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.479
He really wasn’t much trouble.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.250
Listen, uh, Rob Bob, uh

19:44.284 --> 19:46.452
we haven’t been able
to raise, uh

19:46.486 --> 19:49.523
all of the $10,000 ransom,
so, in‐in a couple of days‐‐

19:49.556 --> 19:52.793
Balki, Balki,
we are not giving him any money.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.262
You know...

19:56.296 --> 19:58.699
...you short guys
really tick me off.

19:58.732 --> 20:02.703
You know that?
You sleazy little worm!

20:02.736 --> 20:04.270
I‐I‐I don’t want any money!

20:04.304 --> 20:05.371
Oh, sure, sure now that you know

20:05.405 --> 20:07.608
you’re dealing with somebody
bigger than you are

20:07.641 --> 20:09.910
you sawed‐off
little criminal, huh?

20:09.943 --> 20:11.411
H‐how tall are you?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.747
‐Huh? Huh?
‐Cousin. Cousin...

20:13.780 --> 20:14.915
That’s enough.

20:16.817 --> 20:19.553
I just want Balki to forgive me.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.021
The reason your Dimitri cartoon

20:21.054 --> 20:22.355
got into the Chronicle

20:22.388 --> 20:24.457
is ’cause the cartoon I draw

20:24.490 --> 20:26.760
Kangaroo Cowboy, was dropped

20:26.793 --> 20:28.829
from the paper.

20:28.862 --> 20:30.931
I was hurt.

20:30.964 --> 20:31.998
And I wanted to hurt you

20:32.032 --> 20:34.034
so I took Dimitri.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.603
I thought the paper
would pay the ransom.

20:36.637 --> 20:39.706
But I felt so awful
about what I was doing.

20:39.740 --> 20:42.275
Then I realized

20:42.308 --> 20:43.744
"Kangaroo Cowboy" would never

20:43.777 --> 20:45.812
do something that despicable.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.482
So I’m giving
Dimitri back to you.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.852
I’m sorry, Balki.

20:51.885 --> 20:52.953
I forgive you.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.588
[sighs]

20:55.388 --> 20:56.489
Here, Balki.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.328
You know what you are?

21:02.362 --> 21:05.331
You’re short. You’re so short!

21:05.365 --> 21:06.767
You little worm!

21:06.800 --> 21:09.469
Just a,
just a short little worm!

21:09.503 --> 21:11.572
Just, j‐just... No, come on! No!

21:11.605 --> 21:12.673
Just let me have
one more shot at him.

21:12.706 --> 21:13.774
Hey, hey, hey!

21:13.807 --> 21:15.542
How’s the weather
down there, huh?

21:22.816 --> 21:24.718
Well, why didn’t you tell us
all this when you called?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.987
I tried!

21:27.020 --> 21:28.922
You wouldn’t let me talk!

21:31.491 --> 21:33.359
I hear that.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.461
It’s late. I better get going.

21:35.495 --> 21:37.564
I’m sorry, Balki.

21:37.598 --> 21:40.433
Rob Bob, it’s really,
it’s, it’s, it’s okay.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.369
And, uh, hey,
give Kangaroo Cowboy

21:43.403 --> 21:46.006
a real big buckaroo
howdy for me.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.809
‐Howdy!
‐Howdy!

21:50.677 --> 21:52.345
I’ll tell him. Bye.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.580
Bye.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.821
Come on, Balki,
let’s go up to our office

22:00.854 --> 22:03.089
If we hurry, we can still
get the Dimitri cartoon

22:03.123 --> 22:04.925
on Mr. Wainwright’s desk
by morning.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.461
[screaming]

22:14.968 --> 22:16.770
This is why on Mypos

22:16.803 --> 22:19.072
we leave the marble playing
to professionals.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.546
[theme music]

22:31.752 --> 22:34.120
[theme music]

23:02.148 --> 23:03.950
[music continues]
