00:02.877 --> 00:04.879
Since when is working a door
at a bar

00:04.963 --> 00:07.173
something you get sent
to the trial room for?

00:07.340 --> 00:08.633
There is no way in the world

00:08.717 --> 00:10.969
that I deserve a 30-day rip
for what I did.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.555
And I want my day in court
to say that.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.307
Craig snows the judge
into granting him supervised visitation.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.602
-Now, he’s bucking for full custody.
-Let this one play out, Baldwin.

00:19.769 --> 00:22.522
You’d do anything for your kids, right?
Michael’s my kid.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.024
You’re late, Detective,

00:24.107 --> 00:26.109
and you were supposed to have brought
Michael with you.

00:26.401 --> 00:28.069
He... he left school sometime
after second period,

00:28.153 --> 00:29.154
I don’t know where he is.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.573
Bring him back or I'm gonna forget
that I'm a Christian man,

00:31.823 --> 00:33.992
that I obey the law,
and I'm gonna come after you.

(SIGHS) What’s going, Andy?

00:52.135 --> 00:54.137
-Andy?
-What?

00:54.846 --> 00:57.307
Oh, are those the study tapes
for the sergeant’s test?

00:57.557 --> 00:59.726
-Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT)
-How’s it going?

01:00.435 --> 01:01.686
-What?
-How’s it going?

01:01.770 --> 01:02.854
It’s going good.

01:04.606 --> 01:07.609
-Yeah, I got the trial starting.
-I know.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.278
-Hey, what will be, will be, right?
-Hmm.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.365
-Hey, uh, any word on Michael?
-No.

01:15.116 --> 01:17.911
-I got the trial starting today.
-I know.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.121
I figure the worst thing
that could happen,

01:20.205 --> 01:21.247
they flop me back to uniform.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.917
Well, you take it up on appeal,
that happens.

01:24.125 --> 01:27.587
(SCOFFS) Yeah, well, if that happens,
uh, that’s it.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.548
Yeah, job does that to me, I’m done.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.093
There’s an e-mail there from Michael.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.886
He says he’s all right,
he doesn't want me to worry

01:34.969 --> 01:36.805
but he’s not coming back
while there’s a chance

01:36.888 --> 01:38.807
-Craig can get custody.
-Well, maybe we can trace it.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.809
Do me a favor,
can you get in touch with Taru?

01:40.892 --> 01:42.769
Um, okay.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.146
-I got to get out of here for a while.
-Where you going?

01:45.355 --> 01:47.023
I’m gonna go for a walk.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.235
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.366
We have a report of a possible molestation
from an elementary school.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.034
Ortiz, you and Murphy respond.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.265
Hey, Craig, open up. It’s Baldwin Jones.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.102
Craig?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.356
Either open the door
or I'm gonna break it down.

02:31.234 --> 02:34.988
(GRUNTS) Hey, Craig, where are you?

02:37.157 --> 02:40.326
Come on, we got to talk about this.

-I came in, he was dead on the floor.
-ANDY: How’d you get in?

04:12.126 --> 04:14.754
I knocked, there was no answer,
but I could hear the television was on,

04:14.879 --> 04:15.880
so, I took the door.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.049
-What time was this?
-About 8:30.

04:18.299 --> 04:21.344
-Why were you here?
-Because I wanted to talk to him.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.139
I just got an e-mail from Michael,
and I wanted Craig to know

04:25.223 --> 04:27.475
what he was doing to this kid
by trying to get custody.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.687
-Maybe it was stupid.
-Oh, it was stupid.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.064
What time did you get into the house
this morning?

04:33.231 --> 04:35.441
-Uh, quarter to 8:00.
-And before that?

04:35.900 --> 04:37.485
What, you want me to account
for my whereabouts?

04:37.694 --> 04:39.487
We need for you
to account for your whereabouts.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.116
(SIGHS) Uh, I woke up in my apartment
by myself.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.243
Uh, I went to the corner
to get a coffee and a paper.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.411
Around when was that?

04:47.453 --> 04:51.833
-7:15, 7:18, something like that.
-The e-mail the only communication

04:51.916 --> 04:53.084
-you received from Michael?
-Yeah.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.919
Obviously,
we’re gonna want to talk to him.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.714
You’re not thinking
he’s a possible suspect in this?

04:57.922 --> 04:59.382
If you caught the case, would you?

05:00.383 --> 05:02.468
-Give us a minute.
-Yeah.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.515
You understand,
I have to place you on modified duty.

05:08.766 --> 05:11.102
I guess as long as I’m gonna be a suspect,
you have no choice.

05:11.936 --> 05:13.354
You made yourself a suspect.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.898
Hey boss,
what this guy did warranted a visit?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.650
I thought that’s what
you were paying a lawyer for.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.444
I didn’t feel like
I could leave it to the lawyer.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.115
How many guns you got listed
on your lieutenant card?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.491
-Three.
-Where are they?

05:25.950 --> 05:27.660
One’s here,
one’s in my locker, one’s at home.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.287
Go home, get the one you got there,

05:29.454 --> 05:31.039
voucher the three of them
with the Desk Sergeant.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.882
The boy doesn’t want the nurse
to check him out,

05:41.049 --> 05:42.717
but he was overheard
telling some other kids

05:42.884 --> 05:44.093
he’d been sexually molested.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.055
-Any reason to think he made it up?
-None that I can think of.

-Where is he now?
-He’s in here.

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

-How you doing, Eddie?
-Okay.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.944
I’m Detective Ortiz,
this is Detective Murphy.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.030
I said what happened already.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.366
It would be good
if you could tell us, though.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.536
I was walking to school,
a guy pulled up in a van.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.415
He said he had DVDs for five bucks.
I said, "Which ones?"

06:15.041 --> 06:18.002
He said,<i> "Dodgeball,</i>
<i>Shrek 2, </i>and<i> Kill Bill.’"</i>

06:18.586 --> 06:19.587
I said, "Let’s see them."

06:19.962 --> 06:23.049
He said he’d show them to me
if I got in, so I got in.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.761
-What happened then?
-He drove to under the bridge,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.680
said he didn’t want to take them out
where people were around.

06:30.348 --> 06:31.474
Then he got all weird,

06:31.891 --> 06:35.645
so, I jumped out
and walked back to school. That’s it.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.524
-What do you mean, "He got all weird"?
-Just said some weird stuff.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.193
We need you to tell us
what he said, Eddie.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.820
It’s no big deal.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.280
Oh, we kind of need to put it
in our report.

06:47.073 --> 06:51.369
-You have to write reports?
-Yeah, we gotta write reports.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.207
He said if I gave him my underwear,
he’d give me any three DVDs I wanted.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.377
-What’d you say to him?
-No way.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.880
Did he touch you
or try to get you to touch him?

07:07.844 --> 07:08.845
Eddie?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.639
-Yeah.
-Where?

07:12.640 --> 07:17.019
(SNIFFLES) On my butt,
and in the front.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.814
Did he make you do anything?

07:20.523 --> 07:24.068
He tried to.
I made like I was having an asthma attack.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.573
-He got scared and kicked me out.
-Do you remember anything about him?

07:29.907 --> 07:30.950
He smelled bad.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.995
-Was he white, black?
-White.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.498
-Can you make a guess how old he was?
-I don’t know.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.002
-Was he older than your principal?
-No.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.754
-Was he older than us?
-I don’t know.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.550
How about his hair?
Do you remember what color his hair was?

07:47.717 --> 07:51.304
-He had a beanie on.
-Do you remember anything about the van?

07:51.429 --> 07:54.807
-(SNIFFLES) It was brown.
-Was it Ford or Chevy?

07:55.224 --> 07:58.186
-I don’t know.
-Okay.

07:58.936 --> 08:01.564
I know the license-plate number, though.
(SNIFFLES)

08:01.939 --> 08:05.776
-You remember it?
-VMQ-412.

08:05.943 --> 08:06.944
You sure of that?

08:07.695 --> 08:10.406
I wrote it down In my notebook,
so I wouldn’t forget.

08:15.953 --> 08:19.457
Thanks, Eddie.
You did good, you did real good.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.216
Just the facts, Greg.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.010
These guys don’t want to hear
a lot of elaborate explanations.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.471
I’ll take you
through the sequence of events,

08:33.846 --> 08:36.807
we’ll minimize the best we can,
and that’s it, don’t embellish.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.813
(SIGHS) Let’s get started.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.859
How many years
you been on the job, Detective?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.653
Twenty-four, this April.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.905
Ever have any disciplinary action
taken against you?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.740
-No.
-Civilian complaints?

08:54.116 --> 08:55.535
-None.
-Will you describe

08:55.618 --> 08:57.870
to the Trial Commissioner
what you were doing at McGowan’s bar?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.664
I was helping out on the door.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.583
-How long did you work there?
-A little more than a week.

09:03.292 --> 09:04.335
No further questions.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.006
You said you’ve been
on the job 24 years, Detective?

09:09.423 --> 09:10.841
-That’s correct.
-You have an opportunity

09:10.925 --> 09:12.218
during that time to acquaint yourself

09:12.301 --> 09:15.096
with the departmental regulations
against members of the service

09:15.179 --> 09:16.847
working in a licensed establishment?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.642
Not every regulation’s given
equal weight, Sergeant.

09:20.101 --> 09:22.228
Did you know it was against regulations,
Detective? Yes or no.

09:22.895 --> 09:23.896
Yes, sir.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.857
I assume you knew McGowan’s
was a licensed establishment.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.610
-I... I knew that, too.
-No further questions.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.030
Could I say something,
Mr. Commissioner?

09:33.197 --> 09:35.241
Think whether this is
something best said by your attorney.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.451
No, I... I’d rather say it myself.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.247
My whole time on the job,
I never took money.

09:42.498 --> 09:44.750
Never looked the other way
to get something for nothing,

09:45.209 --> 09:46.460
never did a wrong thing.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.379
Are you expecting a combat cross
for that?

09:48.546 --> 09:49.839
(SIGHS) No, Commissioner.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.967
I’m just trying
to put what I did in perspective.

09:54.218 --> 09:56.887
My daughter came to me
to help her buy a house.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.308
She doesn’t feel safe where she is
and she wants to move to Long Island.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.812
She picked out your basic starter house,
two bedrooms, one and a half baths.

10:06.063 --> 10:11.611
And she needed me to help her.
So, that’s all I was trying to do.

10:13.571 --> 10:17.950
(SIGHS) And, I thought
maybe you should know that.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.838
Hey, can I talk to you guys a second?

10:42.975 --> 10:45.144
-(DOOR CLOSES)
-I went home to get the other gun.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.229
It wasn’t there, I don’t know what to do.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.524
Baldwin, you might want to talk
to a lawyer.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.693
-Am I under arrest?
-Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.236
When was the last time you saw the gun?

10:54.362 --> 10:57.573
A week ago, maybe.
I had the painters at the house.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.283
When they got done,
I took it out of the cabinet

10:59.367 --> 11:01.035
and put it back on a high shelf
in the bedroom.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.662
Michael must have taken it.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.706
-(SIGHS) This stays with us.
-What about Bale?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.708
You turned the guns over to me
and I voucher them.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.418
Are you sure you want to do that, Andy?

11:09.877 --> 11:11.671
Tell me you didn’t use that gun
to kill this guy.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.675
You think
I would actually do something like that?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.635
-Tell me you didn’t.
-I didn’t.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.345
You turned them over to me.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.276
-So, when did Craig move in?
-Six months ago.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.778
Did you notice anything

11:35.861 --> 11:37.613
about the kind of people
he associated with?

11:37.988 --> 11:40.491
-I don’t see no people.
-What about neighbors?

11:41.242 --> 11:45.579
I know he was friends with a woman.
But I keep my nose out, so I don’t know.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.124
You see something between them,
Mr. Kosovic?

11:48.833 --> 11:49.917
He’s in 3-F.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.461
I get a call
from pain-in-the-ass woman in 2-F,

11:52.545 --> 11:54.338
there’s water coming in from the ceiling.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.382
So, I go to his apartment

11:56.465 --> 11:59.009
to see where it’s coming from,
and she’s there.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.845
-Who is she?
-3-H.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.849
-Is she home now, do you know?
-Husband at work, she home all day.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.101
Thanks.

12:07.810 --> 12:11.313
-So, did you know Craig Woodruff?
-Uh, just to say hello.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.066
-Were you ever in his apartment?
-No.

12:14.525 --> 12:16.861
-And he was never in yours?
-(CHUCKLES) Oh, no, never.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.028
We talked to someone who said

12:18.112 --> 12:20.030
they might have seen you
in his apartment at some point.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.782
I don’t know why they would say that.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.368
It’s very important, Mrs. Barker,
that you tell us the truth.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.995
Well, I understand that.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.872
If you’re concerned
something will come out

12:27.955 --> 12:30.958
about the kind of relationship
you and Craig had,

12:31.250 --> 12:33.586
the best way to prevent it
is to tell us the truth.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.422
If it has nothing to do with the homicide,
it will go no further than us.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.549
We find out you’re lying to us,
then I said something else.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.342
-(SCOFFS)
-(POLICE SIREN WAILING)

12:40.426 --> 12:43.554
-I was, very foolish.
-In what way?

12:43.763 --> 12:48.017
I believed that behaving a certain way
would make me more

12:48.100 --> 12:50.561
of what I wanted to appear
in the eyes of the world.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.480
I’ve had two children,

12:52.855 --> 12:56.442
Detective, and I do the best I can
with what god’s given me,

12:56.525 --> 12:59.987
but I ain’t no Beyoncé,
and I know that.

13:00.654 --> 13:03.032
-How did it start?
-We saw each other in the building,

13:03.115 --> 13:07.328
and he was friendly to me.
I was friendly back.

13:08.287 --> 13:11.874
Then it escalated
and became more than that.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.169
-Did your husband ever find out?
-No, no, he did not.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.505
And I made sure that whatever was going on

13:17.588 --> 13:20.466
between Mr. Woodruff and myself,
stayed outside of my home.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.426
Now, that was very important to me.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.096
I did not want to disrespect my husband
in any way.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.599
And I certainly
didn’t want my children seeing any of this

13:28.682 --> 13:32.061
or knowing this about their mother,
I... and I maintained that.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.647
It must not have been too easy
with him living down the hall.

13:34.814 --> 13:40.277
(SCOFFS) It most certainly was not easy,
but that was what I did.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.240
When you make a mistake such as I made,

13:45.074 --> 13:48.327
it is your obligation
to keep it from hurting other people.

13:48.786 --> 13:52.039
-Did Mr. Woodruff cooperate?
-Oh, he had no choice.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.875
I was a weak-willed woman at first,

13:55.000 --> 13:58.462
but I became a strong-willed woman.
And Mr. Woodruff, he knew that.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.506
When can we talk to your husband?

14:00.631 --> 14:02.633
He’s a supervisor
with the transit authority,

14:02.716 --> 14:05.845
and he’s at a management seminar,
I... I don’t know when he’ll be done.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.306
Would you ask him
to, uh, call us when he gets back?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.518
Well, wait a minute,
why do you need to talk to him?

14:12.685 --> 14:13.769
See if he knows anything.

14:14.895 --> 14:17.940
You’re not gonna say anything
to him, are you?

14:18.148 --> 14:21.026
If he doesn’t know,
we’re not gonna be the ones that tell him.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.237
(SIGHS)

14:33.998 --> 14:37.501
This is Gerard Donnelley.
He’s with the squad at the seven-two.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.837
-Detectives Ortiz and Murphy.
-Hey.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.839
He’s been working a homicide
for more than a year

14:41.922 --> 14:43.799
that might be related
to the case you got this morning.

14:43.883 --> 14:47.303
The victim was an 11-year-old male,
white, he’d been sexually molested.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.681
We have a witness who I.D.'d
a brown van as being involved.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.934
Ours just came back as being registered
to a church on 11th street.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.728
Yeah, you’re welcome to ride along.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.688
-Thanks, Lieutenant.
-You got it.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.906
-RITA: So, it’s registered to the church?
-Yes.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.452
-Who was driving the van this morning?
-Can I ask what this is about?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.330
We have information that
it may have been involved in an accident.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.332
Probably wrong,
but we have to check it out anyway.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.126
-Oh, dear.
-We just need to fill in all the blanks.

15:19.460 --> 15:23.631
Well, uh, Lynn Cahill is who drives it,
she works in our feeding program.

15:23.797 --> 15:26.383
-Anyone else?
-Not that I'm aware of.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.718
How about you, you ever drive it?

15:27.843 --> 15:31.889
No, I have on occasion
but, uh, as I said, normally, it’s Lynn.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.474
Where can we find Lynn?

15:34.391 --> 15:36.727
Find her in our soup kitchen,
all day, every day.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.562
Unfortunately, we need to impound the van.

15:40.189 --> 15:43.609
-Is that absolutely necessary?
-I’m sorry to say it is.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.569
These officers will stay with it
until it gets towed in.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.196
If we find out we don't need it,

15:47.279 --> 15:48.948
we’ll get it back to you
as quickly as we can.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.033
How long have you been
at this Parish, Father?

15:51.116 --> 15:53.994
(CHUCKLES) It’s three years this March.

15:54.119 --> 15:57.373
-Where’d you come from?
-St. Agnes, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.041
Thought you’d try out
the big city for a change?

15:59.166 --> 16:02.002
(LAUGHS) Actually,
the Diocese closed down that Parish

16:02.127 --> 16:04.046
and there was a need for someone here.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.591
-Thanks for your time, Father.
-Oh, thank you.

16:10.761 --> 16:14.556
<i>-Dominus vobiscum, </i>Father.
<i>-Et cum spiritu tuo.</i>

16:26.777 --> 16:29.363
Uh, this is Tammy Carlisle,
Michael’s aunt.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.156
-I know Tammy.
-Detective.

16:31.782 --> 16:33.158
ANDY: Why don’t we go back here and talk?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.745
-John Clark.
-Tammy Carlisle.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.459
-(CLEARS THROAT) How’d it go down there?
-(SIGHS) I said what I have to say.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.671
They’ll call me when
the Trial Commissioner has a decision.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.880
We got to go do this.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.758
If he wants to cut me a break,
he will, that’s all.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.475
Where were you this morning, Tammy?

17:00.686 --> 17:04.940
Um, I was at home till about 7:00
and then at work after that.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.817
When was the last time
you saw Craig Woodruff?

17:06.984 --> 17:08.986
Mm-hmm, more than a year ago, why?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.113
He’s been murdered. (CLEARS THROAT)

17:12.489 --> 17:14.658
Huh, my Lord.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.494
You’re someone
that Craig did a lot of damage to.

17:18.120 --> 17:20.706
He killed your sister,
beat you physically,

17:20.831 --> 17:23.625
and now, here he was back
to do more damage to your nephew.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.253
Are you suggesting that I killed him?

17:26.378 --> 17:27.463
If you did, Tammy,

17:27.546 --> 17:29.590
the only way we can help you
is if we know about it.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.842
-I did not.
-You own a gun?

17:35.721 --> 17:36.722
Tammy?

17:40.017 --> 17:41.977
When I got all done
putting myself together

17:42.102 --> 17:43.520
after Craig beat me that time,

17:44.730 --> 17:47.232
my husband vowed that no one
would ever lay a hand on me again.

17:47.357 --> 17:51.320
-Where’s the gun now?
-(SIGHS) It’s in our home.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.448
We’re gonna need to go with you
while you pick it up.

17:55.324 --> 17:57.534
-Are we gonna be arrested?
-We need to do some tests

17:57.659 --> 17:59.328
to determine whether or not
it’s the murder weapon.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.579
But it’s an illegal gun.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.582
We’re in possession of an illegal gun,
will we be arrested for that?

18:03.957 --> 18:05.667
Let’s take things one step at a time, hmm?

18:12.257 --> 18:14.384
The e-mail was sent from an internet cafe
on avenue "B."

18:14.718 --> 18:17.471
-He used the account of a friend of his.
-You contact the friend?

18:17.554 --> 18:19.014
Yeah, I got him and his parents coming in.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.935
-May I speak to Detective Jones, please?
-Sure.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.315
What’d Michael say in the e-mail?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.651
Just that he was all right
and he didn’t want me to worry.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.028
-You think he killed Craig?
-I don’t know, Tammy.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.533
-He’d have had more reason than anybody.
-Yeah, that’s true.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.495
Between me and you,
I hope to God you got him someplace safe.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.755
Why don’t you have a seat?
We’ll be with you in a minute.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.013
-How’s it looking?
-Too soon to tell.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.267
-The aunt?
-Still checking, not likely.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.727
-What about Jones?
-No way it’s him.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.646
How much of that’s not wanting it
to be him?

19:07.729 --> 19:10.899
Boss, I know the guy five years,
this isn’t something he’d do.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.901
-You voucher the guns?
-Yeah.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.736
Find another suspect, Sipowicz

19:15.195 --> 19:17.072
or we’re gonna have to start looking
at Jones hard.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.264
There’s no question
but that Detective Medavoy

19:42.347 --> 19:44.016
was working a licensed establishment.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.685
There’s no question
that such employment is prohibited.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.605
As such, I find Detective Medavoy guilty.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.525
And because I sympathize with you,
trying to do right by your daughter.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.903
Because I don’t believe
justice would be served

19:56.028 --> 19:57.779
by worsening your financial situation,

19:58.280 --> 20:01.158
I fine you five days’ salary.
We’re adjourned.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.000
So, Tennyson,
when’s the last time you saw Michael?

20:11.335 --> 20:14.338
I don’t know.
Week ago, something like that.

20:14.421 --> 20:16.048
-Do you know where he is?
-No.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.175
Well, he sent an e-mail
from your account this morning.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.844
He’s probably getting yelled at
for using his too much.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.597
They’re always scheming something,
these guys.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.934
-You know he hasn’t been in school.
-Figured he was sick.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.978
You didn’t call him,
let him know what the assignments were?

20:30.103 --> 20:33.232
-The teachers all have websites for that.
-Has he not been sick?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.067
He’s been missing.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.195
Not that I wouldn’t be going crazy
if it were Tennyson,

20:38.320 --> 20:42.407
but it has happened
that boys disappear for a while.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.576
ANDY: You folks should know
this isn’t just a missing kid

20:44.701 --> 20:48.372
that we asked you in here for.
This is a homicide investigation.

20:48.538 --> 20:51.625
-Michael’s father’s been murdered.
-Oh, my God.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.003
Tennyson, if you know where Michael is,
you need to tell us now.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.464
I don’t know where he is.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.717
-When’s the last time you spoke to him?
-If he knew, he’d say he knows.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.511
ANDY: I’m giving him another opportunity

21:02.678 --> 21:04.471
to think about
whether or not he does know.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.057
Are you thinking
that Michael might have killed his father?

21:07.140 --> 21:08.558
(CLEARS THROAT) We just wanna talk to him.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.519
I understand
you want to protect your friend.

21:10.769 --> 21:12.604
I’m sure he told you not to say anything

21:12.729 --> 21:15.107
about where he is to anybody,
no matter what.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.526
The problem is
that now that there’s been a homicide,

21:17.609 --> 21:18.986
you can’t protect him anymore.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.947
We have police officers
all over the city looking for him,

21:22.030 --> 21:24.157
we will find him, and when we do,

21:24.408 --> 21:27.077
if it turns out that you knew where he was
and you’re not telling us,

21:27.619 --> 21:29.871
you could find yourself
in a lot of trouble.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.124
Do you know, Tennyson?

21:35.252 --> 21:37.129
He stayed
in the Port Authority Bus Station

21:37.296 --> 21:38.922
for, like, two nights.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.634
Then he called me, said he was too scared
to stay there anymore.

21:43.969 --> 21:46.138
Jason stays in Maya’s room
most of the time,

21:46.471 --> 21:49.349
and I said Michael could stay in his room.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.185
I want it understood,
no one knew anything about a homicide.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.312
Jason is who?

21:53.478 --> 21:57.065
Tennyson’s brother, he’s in school at NYU.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.483
We need your assurance

21:58.608 --> 22:00.986
that no one’s gonna call Michael
to let him know we’re coming.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.030
Nobody is calling anybody.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.831
-Thanks for coming in.
-I hope everything works out.

22:13.165 --> 22:17.085
-Say hi to Michael.
-He’s been holed up in an NYU dorm.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.087
Well, can I go with you?

22:19.963 --> 22:21.465
Lieutenant wants you
in the house, Baldwin.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.384
Michael’s got a gun.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.262
If me being there stops him
from doing something stupid,

22:27.429 --> 22:30.849
I’d like to be there. Please.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.560
Meet us out by the car.

22:52.913 --> 22:53.914
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

22:54.706 --> 22:55.999
Hey, Michael.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.834
-What’s going on?
-Let me have the bag.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.753
-Why?
-Give him the bag, Michael.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.175
-You had me scared to death.
-I’m sorry.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.968
-This it?
-Yeah.

23:07.969 --> 23:09.596
-We’re gonna need to talk, Michael.
-How come?

23:09.679 --> 23:10.972
BALDWIN: You don’t ask the questions.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.225
These detectives
are gonna ask the questions, you got it?

23:13.683 --> 23:14.810
-Yeah.
-And if it turns out

23:14.893 --> 23:16.686
-you lied about anything at all...
-I’m not gonna lie.

23:17.646 --> 23:18.855
Let’s go, come on.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.989
Excuse me, is there a Lynn Cahill here?

23:28.782 --> 23:30.200
-Over there.
-Thank you.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.748
-Lynn Cahill?
-Uh-huh.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.792
We’re detectives,
can we talk to you for a second?

23:39.292 --> 23:40.335
Yeah, yes.

23:41.378 --> 23:42.921
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

23:43.630 --> 23:45.841
-Do you drive the Church’s brown van?
-Uh-huh.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.634
-Did you drive it this morning?
-No.

23:48.218 --> 23:49.636
-Who did?
-No one did.

23:49.803 --> 23:51.388
-Do you take it home with you at night?
-No.

23:52.180 --> 23:54.641
-Who, besides yourself, drives it?
-As a rule, no one.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.102
-And you keep the keys to it where?
-In my bag.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.521
-Has anyone ever taken the keys?
-No.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.399
Miss Cahill, that van was used by someone

24:02.482 --> 24:05.777
-who sexually molested an 11-year-old boy.
-How do you know that?

24:06.111 --> 24:07.446
The boy wrote down the license plate.

24:07.863 --> 24:10.699
We don’t ask people’s backgrounds here,
we don't even ask their names.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.285
They line up, they get their food,
they eat, and they leave.

24:13.785 --> 24:14.870
Well, maybe you could call us

24:14.995 --> 24:16.580
if you think of anything
out of the ordinary.

24:16.746 --> 24:19.416
-Where is the van now?
-It’s been impounded.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.877
Oh, that’s going to present
a hardship for us.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.211
We’re sorry.

24:29.426 --> 24:33.263
-Why did you take the gun, Michael?
-I’m not much of a fighter.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.391
I figured I might need something
so people would leave me alone.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.061
-Where were you this morning?
-In Tennyson’s brother’s dorm room.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.146
Anyone see you there?

24:41.897 --> 24:43.440
-His brother did.
-What time was that?

24:43.690 --> 24:46.943
He came in to get his books for class.
I think it was about 8:00.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.862
And how long had you been in the room?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.448
-I slept in the room.
-What time did you go to sleep?

24:52.491 --> 24:54.201
-Like nine o'clock.
-That’s kind of early.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.245
I didn’t have anything to do,
I couldn’t call anybody.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.207
I figured the best thing to do
was just stay in the room.

25:01.249 --> 25:05.712
-When was the last time you saw your dad?
-That day when he had visitation at court.

25:06.296 --> 25:08.173
-You haven’t seen him since?
-Nope.

25:10.717 --> 25:12.802
Michael, he was found dead
in his apartment this morning.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.767
(INHALES SHARPLY) I’m not sorry he’s dead.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.938
-Nobody expects you to be.
-You’re a kid, Michael.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.941
If you had to shoot him
’cause you were afraid of him,

25:26.024 --> 25:28.777
-people will understand.
-I didn’t.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.612
We’re gonna test the gun.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.365
If it was used to kill him,
we’re gonna know.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.117
Best thing he ever did for me
was get himself killed.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.335
You guys get any kind
of a bad hit off the Padre?

25:45.710 --> 25:48.088
-Not especially.
-I did. I did a little digging.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.800
Turns out there was a criminal complaint
pending against him in Harrisburg,

25:51.925 --> 25:55.136
allegations of sexual molestation
and forcible sodomy.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.681
We should talk to him again.

26:00.725 --> 26:01.726
Anything?

26:01.810 --> 26:04.938
Alibi isn’t exactly airtight,
but I don’t think he did it.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.482
A uniform just found a gun
in the laundry room of the building.

26:07.732 --> 26:11.069
Any fellow tenants you’re looking at,
you might want to look at harder.

26:16.116 --> 26:18.326
Sorry to interrupt the seminar,
Mr. Barker,

26:18.451 --> 26:19.703
but we did need to talk to you.

26:19.828 --> 26:23.123
Well, that's okay, these seminars
are about a half-hour’s worth of material

26:23.206 --> 26:24.833
and six hours worth of doughnuts.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.460
(SIGHS) What time did you leave
to go to work this morning?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.588
Same as usual, uh, 7:00 a.m.

26:29.838 --> 26:31.172
-You go by yourself?
-Right.

26:31.506 --> 26:34.009
-Do you know Craig Woodruff?
-Just from seeing him in the building.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.385
You never had any dealings with him?

26:35.468 --> 26:37.554
-No problems, no disagreements?
-No, sir.

26:38.179 --> 26:40.849
-Do you know he was murdered?
-My wife called and told me.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.685
-Do you own a gun, Mr. Barker?
-No.

26:44.311 --> 26:46.438
You ought to know that a gun
was found in the building.

26:46.688 --> 26:47.731
It wasn’t mine.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.858
That gun is gonna be put
through ballistic tests

26:50.025 --> 26:51.693
and dusted for fingerprints.

26:52.360 --> 26:56.615
If it turns out to be the murder weapon,
and it comes back to you or your wife,

26:56.698 --> 26:59.242
the fact that you’re lying to us
isn’t gonna work in your favor.

26:59.326 --> 27:01.494
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What reason
would I have to be lying to you?

27:01.578 --> 27:03.955
Do you know if your wife
was acquainted with Mr. Woodruff?

27:04.039 --> 27:05.540
Only to say hi to him in the hallway.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.627
Is it possible there was more to it
and you didn't know about it?

27:08.835 --> 27:10.420
Are you suggesting my wife was unfaithful?

27:10.545 --> 27:12.839
We're asking was there any reason
for you to believe that she was?

27:13.214 --> 27:14.299
The answer’s no.

27:14.507 --> 27:17.010
Is it possible
that Craig forced himself on her

27:17.177 --> 27:19.638
-and she used the gun to defend herself?
-No!

27:19.721 --> 27:21.765
We don’t have any problem
believing the first part,

27:21.890 --> 27:23.266
’cause we know
what kind of guy he was.

27:23.350 --> 27:24.851
So that if you know
what kind of guy he was,

27:24.934 --> 27:27.187
then why are you working so hard
to try and find out who killed him?

27:27.312 --> 27:28.355
You know the answer to that.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.940
ANDY: There are inconsistencies
in your wife’s story Mr. Barker.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.777
-Like, what kind of inconsistencies?
-We're not gonna go over them with you.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.321
Just believe us
when we tell you she’s a suspect.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.824
-My wife would never kill anyone!
-We’re gonna put her in the laundry room

27:39.949 --> 27:42.494
between the time of the killing
and when that gun was discovered.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.329
We’re also gonna put her
in Woodruff’s apartment.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.748
-You’re just grasping at straws!
-No, sir!

27:47.207 --> 27:48.291
Now listen to me.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.670
The D.A. is preparing
to go to the grand jury.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.256
Your wife is gonna be indicted for murder.

27:56.132 --> 27:59.386
What you need to be thinking about
is how you can help her.

28:07.769 --> 28:09.771
You know, people think
’cause I'm easygoing,

28:11.022 --> 28:14.234
-that I don’t have it in me to explode.
-Is that wrong?

28:15.443 --> 28:16.945
I shot Craig Woodruff.

28:17.028 --> 28:20.115
I shot him
and I hid the gun in the laundry room.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.494
You know, all he had to do
was leave it be.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.455
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-There’s nothing he had to say.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.458
Just allow my wife and I
to go back to our apartment

28:30.583 --> 28:32.085
and work it out between ourselves.

28:32.627 --> 28:35.130
-He didn’t do that?
-No, he thought he’d have a little fun.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.759
Talked about his sexual prowess,
how I had better get used to the fact

28:39.843 --> 28:42.595
that there was now no way
my wife would ever be happy with me again.

28:43.430 --> 28:44.681
And what did you do at that point?

28:46.683 --> 28:49.936
I had dinner with my family.
I... I tried to go to sleep.

28:53.481 --> 28:56.901
Then, around five o'clock this morning,
I decided,

28:57.152 --> 28:58.945
you know,
I... I needed to tell Mr. Woodruff

28:59.821 --> 29:01.990
that if we were to continue
living down the hall from one another,

29:02.115 --> 29:06.119
he had to respect my wife, my family...

29:08.246 --> 29:09.622
and he had to respect me.

29:11.207 --> 29:14.419
He was angry I woke him,
he... he cursed at me.

29:16.212 --> 29:20.300
Then he laughed at me,
and he slapped me in the face.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.343
And you shot him.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.267
I had no forgiveness left.

29:43.323 --> 29:45.241
We appreciate
you coming in with us, Father.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.910
There’s a few questions
we still need to ask.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.496
-Sure.
-Were you at the church this morning?

29:49.621 --> 29:52.707
-Say, between the hours of 7:00 and 9:00?
-I was.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.001
I hear confession between 8:00 and 9:00.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.003
What about between 7:00 and 8:00?

29:57.253 --> 30:02.008
Um, I rode the stationary bicycle
between 6:30 and quarter after 7:00.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.302
Then I went over
to the coffee shop on the corner

30:04.385 --> 30:07.180
and had breakfast
from 7:20 to ten of 8:00.

30:07.597 --> 30:10.558
Between 8:00 and 9:00, was there anyone
other than the penitents who saw you?

30:11.267 --> 30:13.853
It’s sounding like you suspect me
of something, Detective.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.314
We’re just trying to account for anyone
who had access to the van.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.441
-I see.
-What about it, Father?

30:19.192 --> 30:22.362
Well, uh, Sister Claddagh
would have seen me at the rectory

30:22.445 --> 30:24.239
when I returned from the coffee shop.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.700
-Luis saw me when I went Into the Church.
-Who’s Luis?

30:28.076 --> 30:31.746
-He sweeps the Church every morning.
-We’ll need contact information.

30:34.624 --> 30:37.293
This isn’t an accident
you’re looking into, is it?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.128
You said
you drove the brown van on occasion.

30:39.504 --> 30:42.632
-When was the last occasion you drove it?
-I would guess several weeks ago.

30:42.715 --> 30:45.176
Now, what is it exactly
that you’re investigating?

30:45.635 --> 30:47.679
A boy was sexually molested
on the way to school.

30:47.887 --> 30:49.764
We have reason to believe
the person responsible

30:50.014 --> 30:52.684
-was driving that brown van.
-Dear God.

30:52.892 --> 30:55.770
When you told us you left Harrisburg
because they were closing the parish,

30:55.937 --> 30:58.481
-that wasn’t quite true, was it?
-It was completely true.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.900
Oh, so the charge
that you sodomized a 14-year-old boy

31:01.067 --> 31:02.110
had nothing to do with it?

31:02.235 --> 31:04.612
That charge was investigated
by the police department

31:04.737 --> 31:08.241
and by the district attorney’s office,
and it proved to be completely false.

31:08.408 --> 31:09.909
Did the bishop have anything
to do with that?

31:09.993 --> 31:12.453
No, sir. That boy was found
to be mentally unstable.

31:12.912 --> 31:15.707
-I bet.
-Father, is there anyone you can think of

31:15.832 --> 31:18.293
who might've been in a position
to take the van without permission?

31:18.418 --> 31:21.212
No, I'm sorry, I can’t think of anyone
who would have done that.

31:21.337 --> 31:24.007
-You might have done it, Father.
-I might have, but I didn’t.

31:24.173 --> 31:25.717
You don’t need anybody’s permission
to take it.

31:25.925 --> 31:27.302
You want to take it, you take it.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.095
No one’s gonna tell you no,
and what’s more,

31:29.178 --> 31:31.556
they’re gonna close ranks
around you when you ask them to...

31:31.723 --> 31:33.683
-Detective!
-...no questions asked.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.268
Can we maybe step outside a second?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.812
You have it fixed in your head
I’ve done something wrong.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.189
I don’t know there’s anything
I can do to change that.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.817
-Detective.
-You’re damn right.

31:52.702 --> 31:53.912
-What?
-What are you trying to do?

31:54.037 --> 31:56.706
-I’m trying to get him to tell the truth.
-I think he is telling the truth.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.416
Right, right, ’cause with that collar on,

31:58.541 --> 32:01.377
-they’re incapable of telling a lie.
-You're not a lie detector.

32:01.461 --> 32:04.297
Excuse me, there’s a Lynn Cahill here
to talk to you, she says it’s important.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.008
-Let her come over.
-Um.

32:10.303 --> 32:11.804
You have Father McIntyre in there?

32:12.263 --> 32:13.973
-Yes, we do.
-Is he a suspect in this?

32:14.390 --> 32:17.018
-We can’t really get into that.
-I hope he’s not a suspect.

32:17.185 --> 32:20.188
Why is that? Because he knows
the right things to say when someone dies?

32:20.271 --> 32:21.648
He’s genuinely concerned about the poor?

32:21.731 --> 32:23.900
He’s got a nice smile on his face
when he passes out the wafers?

32:23.983 --> 32:25.234
Why don’t we hear from her why it is?

32:25.318 --> 32:28.112
It’s because his chastity
isn’t challenged by young boys.

32:28.529 --> 32:29.906
It’s challenged by women.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.283
-You know this?
-Yes.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.828
There’s also someone in the food program
you might want to talk to.

32:35.995 --> 32:37.497
-Who’s that?
-His name’s Eric.

32:37.705 --> 32:42.377
I asked around, someone I trust told me
he had a set of keys to the van made.

32:43.503 --> 32:45.338
-When’s the next meal?
-Five o'clock.

32:47.131 --> 32:49.300
Do you want to tell Father McIntyre
he can go, or should we?

32:54.931 --> 32:58.601
Excuse me, my husband Harold Barker
is here and I’d like to talk to him.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.854
-I think he may be in with the detectives.
-But I need to talk to him.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.564
As soon as they come out,
you can tell them.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.570
-How’d it go?
-Good.

33:16.744 --> 33:20.039
Five-day rip’s not bad, Detective.
Turns out you were right to go to trial.

33:21.207 --> 33:24.252
-Uh-huh.
-Anyway, glad it’s over.

33:29.298 --> 33:30.675
(DOOR SLAMS)

33:35.263 --> 33:38.057
-This was an exercise for you.
-No, Detective.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.310
-This was an enforcement of regulations.
-It was an exercise.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.188
It was
out of the command-and-control playbook.

33:44.480 --> 33:47.567
It made you feel like someone
who’s not afraid to make tough decisions,

33:47.859 --> 33:49.152
a man in charge of men.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.279
You might want to take
a deep breath right about now.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.531
Oh, I’ve done
all the deep breathing I need to do.

33:54.574 --> 33:58.494
I’ve laid awake at night for a week.
I haven’t been able to eat.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.955
I walked into that trial room today

34:01.456 --> 34:04.000
and my hands were sweating
and my mouth was dry.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.626
And you put me through that
for nothing.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.463
You could have told me
to stop working in the bar

34:08.588 --> 34:12.091
and I would have quit that very minute.
Instead, you tortured me.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.678
Not because you had to,
because you could.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.850
I understand
you’ve been through an ordeal, Detective.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.519
And I can see that it’s put
a great strain on you emotionally.

34:24.812 --> 34:26.439
I think you should take
the rest of the day.

34:26.773 --> 34:29.776
Hopefully, tonight you’ll sleep,
and tomorrow you’ll come in fit for duty.

34:41.829 --> 34:42.955
How’d it go, Medavoy?

34:46.793 --> 34:49.003
-Mrs. Barker.
-Where’s my husband?

34:49.921 --> 34:52.131
-He’s gonna be processed.
-What do you mean "processed"?

34:52.256 --> 34:54.383
Your husband confessed
to the murder of Craig Woodruff.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.511
-He’s been placed under arrest.
-That’s wrong.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.221
He’ll have an attorney,
he’ll have a trial.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.807
No, that is wrong,
what he is telling you is wrong.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.228
Look, I have something to tell you,
and you need to hear what I have to say.

35:06.354 --> 35:11.150
I told Craig that he had embarrassed me
and that he had humiliated my husband.

35:12.443 --> 35:16.155
He laughed at me. He put his hands on me.

35:16.989 --> 35:19.992
I tried to push him away,
and when he wouldn’t let me, I shot him.

35:20.743 --> 35:24.997
Mrs. Barker, we understand you’re carrying
a fair amount of guilt over what happened.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.500
But if what you’re trying to do is
to help your husband,

35:27.583 --> 35:28.668
this isn’t the way to do it.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.920
-(SIGHS)
-Was your husband lying to us?

35:31.212 --> 35:33.840
Of course, he was,
he was trying to protect me.

35:34.006 --> 35:36.509
-Or you’re lying to protect him.
-But I shot him.

35:36.759 --> 35:40.429
And I hid the gun in the laundry room,
and that is the God’s-honest truth.

35:59.740 --> 36:01.200
That’s him, in the plaid shirt.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.454
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

36:06.539 --> 36:07.582
Talk to you a minute?

36:09.625 --> 36:11.669
-What about?
-We’d rather talk to you outside.

36:12.044 --> 36:15.131
-Hey, I ain’t losing my place in line.
-We’ll make sure you get something to eat.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.967
Yeah, how about this, honey,
I'll make sure I get something to eat.

36:18.467 --> 36:21.053
Be smart, walk out of here with us
or you’re gonna embarrass yourself

36:21.137 --> 36:22.138
in front of all these people.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.433
(SIGHS) Mother Teresa.

36:25.516 --> 36:28.477
She sticks a knife in
when you ain’t even looking. (GRUNTS)

36:29.228 --> 36:30.396
You fingered me for them, Lynn?

36:32.940 --> 36:33.941
That wasn’t very smart.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.492
-You know why you’re here, right, Eric?
-No idea.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.537
We have information that you might've
been selling bootleg DVDs.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.581
You took me out of there for that?

36:48.706 --> 36:50.875
We’re under a lot of pressure
to make arrests for that.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.462
All right, I sold some bootleg DVDs.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.591
And just so we can complete the statement,
were you selling those out of a brown van?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.843
-Yeah.
-Who does that belong to?

37:02.136 --> 37:04.597
The Church, runs the food program
where you picked me up.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.808
Did you ever sell any bootleg DVDs to him?

37:13.272 --> 37:15.233
-No.
-There’s no turning back now, Eric.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.860
You admitted to the DVDs,
you’ve admitted to the van,

37:17.944 --> 37:20.196
and this kid’s gonna pick you
out of a lineup, one, two, three.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.866
-What’s he saying?
-That you roughed him up.

37:24.075 --> 37:27.453
Maybe there is some misunderstanding,
maybe he tried to run off without paying

37:27.536 --> 37:29.956
-and you went to stop him.
-Were you in the van with him? Yes or no?

37:30.998 --> 37:32.124
What do I get for that?

37:32.375 --> 37:34.669
Less than a year,
maybe that gets suspended, too.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.462
(SIGHS)

37:39.674 --> 37:41.008
Yeah, I was in the van with him.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.222
What about this kid,
the one you murdered?

37:48.766 --> 37:50.184
I take back everything I said.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.395
-It doesn’t work that way.
-I lied about everything.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.439
Listen carefully, Eric.
This is the best possible approach

37:55.564 --> 37:58.150
you can take right now.
You have a sickness of the mind.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.945
This sickness causes you
to have an insatiable desire

38:01.070 --> 38:02.947
for sexual contact with young boys.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.866
-Would you disagree with that, Eric?
-I’m done talking.

38:06.033 --> 38:09.829
Sometimes, you’ve had to force young boys
to provide you with that sexual contact,

38:09.954 --> 38:11.956
which was the case
with these two young boys.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.709
-Say if that’s the case.
-I want a lawyer.

38:14.875 --> 38:17.545
This boy got away from you,
this boy did not.

38:17.670 --> 38:19.088
I said I want a lawyer!

38:19.171 --> 38:21.590
When you were finished
having sexual contact with this boy,

38:21.674 --> 38:24.510
whether out of shame or sickness,
you choked him until he was dead.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.849
I think you have to stop talking
to me now.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.406
D.A. wants to interview
the husband and wife both.

38:45.656 --> 38:48.284
They’ll probably end up submitting it
to the grand jury and letting them decide.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.661
What do you want to do
about the gun charge on the aunt?

38:51.537 --> 38:53.164
-What gun charge?
-It’s in the fives.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.458
The aunt had possession of an illegal gun.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.170
You might want to redo that five.
I think it inadvertently got thrown away.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.424
All the people this guy came
into contact with got hurt.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.134
It’s enough now.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.185
I’d like to talk to you two
for a second, if I could.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.604
The guy from the food program lawyered up,

39:16.687 --> 39:18.189
-but he’s good for it.
-Oh, yeah?

39:18.397 --> 39:21.525
He went for the DVDs, the van,
and the initial contact with the kid.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.611
Put that together with the kid’s testimony

39:23.694 --> 39:25.446
and the witness
from the van in the homicide,

39:25.738 --> 39:27.281
-he’s going away.
-That’s great.

39:27.948 --> 39:31.118
-Yeah.
-Can we talk privately?

39:45.841 --> 39:47.093
Sorry about before.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.762
This case sent me back
to when I was younger.

39:50.930 --> 39:54.016
-I was an altar boy.
-You got molested?

39:54.600 --> 39:57.853
Oh, yeah, the whole tour,
trip upstate, cabin in the woods,

39:58.437 --> 40:00.064
honor and privilege of being chosen.

40:01.399 --> 40:05.236
-(EXHALES) He get caught?
-Cirrhosis got him first.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.239
Anyway,
I appreciate you guys being professional.

40:08.322 --> 40:10.950
-I wish I could have been more so.
-You were fine.

40:12.993 --> 40:16.247
-Can I buy you two dinner?
-Sure.

40:21.460 --> 40:22.461
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

40:25.131 --> 40:26.173
Hi, Michael.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.637
Turns out it was
one of the neighbors that killed your dad.

40:33.556 --> 40:35.266
They figure out
what they’re gonna do with me?

40:35.349 --> 40:39.478
-What do you mean?
-Baldwin’s just a foster parent.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.981
He can send me back
to social services whenever he wants.

40:42.857 --> 40:45.109
You’re thinking ’cause he got mad at you,
that’s what he’s gonna do?

40:45.484 --> 40:46.652
It’s not like I'm his kid.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.698
I cause him a lot of trouble.
He’s probably sick of me.

40:51.657 --> 40:52.741
I’m fine with that.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.619
I’d rather go back to the agencies
than have him be all mad at me.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.790
The reason he’s mad at you
is that you are his kid.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.127
Your whole world
is what your kid’s going through.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.462
But it wasn’t my fault.

41:05.754 --> 41:08.215
Maybe it was stupid to take the gun,
but all the rest of it...

41:08.299 --> 41:11.760
-I know that, Baldwin knows it, too.
-Then how come he got mad at me?

41:13.387 --> 41:15.097
Because, at that moment,
he couldn’t help himself.

41:15.973 --> 41:18.309
He’d been so afraid
what might've happened to you,

41:19.393 --> 41:21.770
he was so relieved
to see you in one piece,

41:22.605 --> 41:24.523
everything came crashing together.

41:25.357 --> 41:27.443
He could have
just as easily burst into tears.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.696
-I don’t know about that.
-You should know this,

41:31.864 --> 41:36.076
as much as any father loved any son,
Baldwin loves you.

41:42.458 --> 41:46.045
-You ready?
-ANDY: Take care, Michael.
