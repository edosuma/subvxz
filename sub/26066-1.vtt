00:52.350 --> 00:55.420
My darlings, it is almost
your commencement.

01:01.370 --> 01:06.310
You are so beautiful, my angels.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.450
Miguel, I don't know if you
will ever get this letter.

01:10.460 --> 01:12.450
I hope you know that I am okay

01:12.460 --> 01:16.480
and that I am loved
and that I am ready.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.450
Please don't worry.
Don't be sad.

01:20.460 --> 01:24.480
I'm joining Mom and Dad on the
Anniversary of their Giving.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.420
I am stepping into the Invisible,

01:26.430 --> 01:28.460
where they are waiting for me.

01:28.470 --> 01:31.280
They miss me, and they love me.

01:31.280 --> 01:35.320
And I miss them so much.
I'm sure you do, too.

01:35.340 --> 01:38.370
I think about them every day.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.400
I love you, Miguel.
I always will.

01:41.420 --> 01:44.370
Love, Penelope.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.340
- Mom, please.
- Enough.

01:52.340 --> 01:55.280
I'm not going to say it again.

02:01.310 --> 02:04.400
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, very busy.

02:04.410 --> 02:06.360
Commencement is close.

02:06.370 --> 02:09.419
You guys don't count
as a hospital, huh?

02:09.430 --> 02:11.320
The NFFA doesn't care

02:11.340 --> 02:13.420
about protecting drug addicts
and alcoholics.

02:13.430 --> 02:17.400
We have to lock down
like everyone else.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.370
- What do you need?
- My name is Miguel.

02:20.380 --> 02:22.430
Uh, I called a few times
this morning.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.490
I'm here to see my sister.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.270
No visitors are allowed today.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.400
Look, I've been away a while,
and I need to know...

02:31.420 --> 02:34.300
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

02:34.310 --> 02:36.300
Look, c-can you just please promise me

02:36.310 --> 02:38.300
that you'll have a safe place
for her tonight?

02:38.310 --> 02:39.340
Mom, I really want one.

02:39.340 --> 02:43.340
I'm not going to say it again...
stop asking.

02:43.340 --> 02:45.400
He wants a gun.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.310
He's finally old enough to understand

02:47.310 --> 02:49.370
what this holiday is all about.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.430
He's terrified.

02:50.430 --> 02:52.340
I'm not scared.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.460
Hey, you want to know something?

02:58.460 --> 03:02.330
I'm scared, too.
I'm scared every Purge.

03:02.340 --> 03:05.470
But I learned a trick
when I joined the Marines.

03:05.490 --> 03:09.280
One day, the bad guys
had us surrounded.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.430
And our sergeant, he noticed
that we were all scared.

03:12.440 --> 03:16.400
And you know what he had us do?
Hold hands.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.400
- What?
- Yeah.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.320
He said that it was
scientifically proven

03:21.340 --> 03:23.490
that if you hold hands
with someone,

03:23.500 --> 03:25.370
it lessens your fear.

03:25.370 --> 03:26.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.470
Can you imagine how we looked?

03:28.490 --> 03:31.500
A bunch of tough Marines,
all holding hands together.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.530
Yeah, we felt silly.

03:35.250 --> 03:38.340
But then it worked.
The fear went away.

03:46.430 --> 03:50.310
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

03:50.310 --> 03:53.430
- What's your sister's name?
- Penelope Guerrero.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.400
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:55.410 --> 03:57.440
She checked out
a few months ago.

03:57.460 --> 04:00.400
Ch... checked out?
Where did she go?

04:00.410 --> 04:02.520
I'm not permitted to
give away patient information.

04:02.530 --> 04:04.530
Ma'am, please. I-it's...
It's federal law.

04:04.530 --> 04:08.310
It's the Purge, it's...
Just, please.

04:14.310 --> 04:15.470
But that doesn't mean
I can stop you

04:15.480 --> 04:18.440
from finding what you need
when I walk away.

04:25.470 --> 04:27.480
I hope you find her.

04:27.490 --> 04:30.490
Penelope's a really sweet person.

04:51.510 --> 04:54.320
Henry.

04:54.330 --> 04:56.320
God damn it.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.540
Okay.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.500
- My baby!
- Hey.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.520
Hi.

05:09.540 --> 05:12.350
I brought your favorite flowers.

05:12.360 --> 05:13.390
Oh, good.

05:13.410 --> 05:16.430
It'll cover up the awful smell
of this damn hospital food.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.390
Well, Rose says that you'll
be home in a few days,

05:19.410 --> 05:24.320
that you're doing great...
Better than expected.

05:24.330 --> 05:26.300
You going to or coming from work?

05:26.310 --> 05:28.470
Going to.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.420
On Purge Night?

05:30.430 --> 05:33.310
You need to be staying here with me.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.250
This is the safest place in the city.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.400
The office is safe.

05:36.420 --> 05:40.450
Mom, I wouldn't be going
if it wasn't.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.380
I'll be fine.

05:43.390 --> 05:45.500
They take care of us there.
They do.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.540
You know, I thought by now,
you'd be in a position

05:48.250 --> 05:49.500
where you wouldn't have
to work on a night like this.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.430
You and me both.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.480
If you'd had just
played the game a little...

05:53.490 --> 05:56.430
Oh, Mom, don't start.
Don't do that.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.450
I have to go, Mom.

06:01.470 --> 06:03.490
It's getting close to commencement.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.420
Take all of your meds

06:05.430 --> 06:07.330
and don't give everyone
a hard time.

06:07.350 --> 06:08.500
I wouldn't be Lorraine Barbour

06:08.500 --> 06:10.490
if I didn't give everybody
a hard time.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.540
- Mwah.
- Be safe, okay?

06:13.250 --> 06:14.330
- Mm-hmm.
- Call me.

06:14.350 --> 06:16.380
Love you.

06:16.390 --> 06:19.250
- Call me.
- Love you.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.440
You okay, babe?
What's on your mind?

06:26.450 --> 06:28.540
Oh, I was just wondering

06:29.250 --> 06:30.490
what it's going to be like over there.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.380
I mean, we really have no idea

06:32.390 --> 06:33.540
how these people celebrate the Purge.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.450
Oh, don't think about it.

06:35.470 --> 06:39.360
Find a corner, hide,
and wait to be summoned.

06:39.370 --> 06:41.490
Jenna, does it look like a rental?

06:41.500 --> 06:45.260
No way.
You look amazing.

06:45.270 --> 06:49.300
Me?
Beautiful, as always.

06:51.300 --> 06:54.250
Can't lie...
I am nervous as shit.

06:54.250 --> 06:55.440
Don't be.
It'll be safer than...

06:55.450 --> 06:57.410
any other place
in the country over there.

06:57.420 --> 06:59.500
Not that... I just...
I want it to all go well.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.480
You know, an opportunity
like this comes around

07:01.490 --> 07:04.410
once in 12 lifetimes.

07:04.420 --> 07:07.520
It's going to go great.
This is just a formality.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.410
The only reason
we're being invited

07:09.420 --> 07:12.250
is 'cause he wants
to do this with us.

07:12.250 --> 07:15.480
We're making a deal
with the Devil, babe.

07:15.490 --> 07:17.440
We are taking the Devil's money.

07:17.450 --> 07:20.380
We're going to do
great things with it.

07:28.510 --> 07:31.430
And I hope there are
no surprises tonight.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.290
She won't be there.
No worries.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.370
Tonight's our night.
This is a game changer.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.250
This is everything
we ever wanted...

07:40.260 --> 07:41.400
For us,

07:41.420 --> 07:42.520
for our family.

08:11.380 --> 08:12.410
Only 84 minutes to go

08:12.420 --> 08:14.480
before the Purge sirens
start blaring.

08:14.490 --> 08:16.520
If box store sales
are any indication,

08:16.540 --> 08:18.370
this year may be bigger than ever,

08:18.380 --> 08:19.480
as guns, ammunition,
and survival goods

08:19.490 --> 08:21.250
are flying off the shelves.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.310
It's an arms race
in many neighborhoods

08:22.320 --> 08:23.350
as locals struggle to find

08:23.360 --> 08:24.440
better weaponry than their neighbors,

08:24.450 --> 08:28.400
and semiautomatic rifles
are all but scarce

08:28.410 --> 08:29.480
at most outlets.

08:29.490 --> 08:32.350
911 calls are spiking
in record numbers,

08:32.360 --> 08:34.450
as nervous citizens
make last-minute calls,

08:34.460 --> 08:36.380
while police and fire
prepare to go off duty.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.370
If you don't have
a high-tech security system,

08:39.370 --> 08:40.440
do what you can
before it's too late.

08:40.450 --> 08:43.490
Security experts warn
that Purgers have grown

08:43.500 --> 08:46.500
increasingly bold,
specifically targeting homes

08:46.510 --> 08:49.250
that have been secured
with nothing more

08:49.260 --> 08:50.460
than plywood and nails.

08:50.470 --> 08:52.300
Want a Purge mask, sir?

09:33.520 --> 09:37.320
God, are you nuts?
I don't know where Henry is.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.450
I know you know where he is.

09:38.460 --> 09:40.320
Oh, why are you
breaking my balls like this?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.400
Man, I don't know where she is.

09:42.410 --> 09:44.250
It ain't the Purge yet, fella.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.450
Can't you wait another hour?

09:51.360 --> 09:53.290
Stay down.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.530
What did I do to deserve this?

10:01.250 --> 10:03.320
Aren't you supposed to be
gone somewhere

10:03.330 --> 10:04.410
fighting some stupid war?

10:04.420 --> 10:05.500
Lucky for you, I just got back.

10:05.510 --> 10:09.410
Now, tell me where Henry is.
No more bullshit, Asshole.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.380
Please, please, please.
I don't know.

10:10.390 --> 10:12.510
- Where?
- I don't know, man.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.470
Maybe he's at the Row.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.410
Well, then let's go visit the Row.

10:16.420 --> 10:19.250
Oh!
Let me out of here!

10:25.490 --> 10:27.320
Hey.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.260
You're not working tonight,
are you, Jane?

10:29.270 --> 10:30.530
Overseas markets
don't care about the Purge.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.330
Girl, good luck.

10:33.340 --> 10:35.490
Thanks.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.450
- Hey, boss.
- Hey, employee.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.490
Chiho's landed in Tokyo.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.280
Should be at the office
before we dive in.

10:42.290 --> 10:44.520
- Everything okay?
- Fine. Fine.

10:44.530 --> 10:46.410
Oh, how's your mom?

10:46.420 --> 10:48.420
Doing well.
Thanks for asking, Mark.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.420
- Good, good.
- Oh.

10:55.250 --> 10:57.340
First time I've ever worked
on Purge Night.

10:57.350 --> 11:00.280
It's, uh...
it's weird.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.480
There's no better place to be than here.

11:21.490 --> 11:22.510
It's 5:51 p.m...

11:22.520 --> 11:25.470
Just 69 minutes
until the Purge begins.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.530
If you're not locked down,
you're almost out of time.

11:28.250 --> 11:31.460
- Names?
- Mark Cantoff, Jane Barbour.

11:40.460 --> 11:42.260
They're good.

11:48.330 --> 11:50.250
Great. Now let me
take you through the rules.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.380
Once the Purge begins,
this 38th floor

11:51.390 --> 11:53.270
will be locked down as a safe zone.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.340
Security and all workers,
including the both of you,

11:55.350 --> 11:57.350
have signed waivers, giving up
their rights to Purge

11:57.360 --> 11:59.250
on this floor for the entire evening.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.500
Everyone on 38 except security
will be unarmed.

12:01.510 --> 12:03.500
We can only guarantee
your safety on this floor.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.530
Do you understand these rules?

12:06.250 --> 12:09.360
Thank you for your cooperation.
Enjoy the evening.

12:33.340 --> 12:34.460
Hello, everyone.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.420
- Hi, Jane.
- Hi. Hello.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.460
- Hi, Jane.
- Hello.

12:37.470 --> 12:38.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.350
Jane, I spoke with Chiho, and she is...

12:40.360 --> 12:43.330
She's on the ground already, I heard.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.350
Oh, did you guys
come here together or...?

12:45.360 --> 12:48.300
Of course. Mark spent
the afternoon with me

12:48.320 --> 12:50.530
reviewing everything for tonight.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.420
Relax, Alison, I'm joking.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.490
The two of you need
to put aside your nonsense

12:55.500 --> 12:57.250
and play nice tonight.

12:57.250 --> 12:58.350
There's a lot to do.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.440
Now, get Chiho on the phone
while I settle.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.370
Afterwards, I'll prep the troops

13:02.370 --> 13:04.290
on what we should expect, okay?

13:04.300 --> 13:05.500
Okay?

13:05.510 --> 13:09.520
We are the scarred, the beaten,

13:09.530 --> 13:12.370
the souls irreparably damaged,

13:12.370 --> 13:14.510
and it is that shared pain
that allows us

13:14.520 --> 13:17.480
to understand each other so deeply.

13:17.490 --> 13:21.340
Tonight that suffering ends, my darlings.

13:21.350 --> 13:25.290
I will be your guide
into the Invisible,

13:25.300 --> 13:28.360
where there is no pain, only love.

13:28.370 --> 13:30.250
- Yes.
- Yes.

13:32.380 --> 13:35.350
Come.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.490
The Giving Time is near.
Let us ready.

14:50.410 --> 14:53.250
All right.

15:01.250 --> 15:04.250
Hey, guys.
Going out tonight?

15:04.260 --> 15:05.360
Oh, God.

15:05.370 --> 15:08.370
- Yep.
- Stay safe, Ross.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.300
- Oh, yeah.
- You, too.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.250
Come on, come on.
Stay!

15:16.260 --> 15:19.250
You know, sometimes
I wish we Purged, babe.

15:19.260 --> 15:21.300
I mean, Ross and his mutt
would be gone for good,

15:21.320 --> 15:22.380
and we wouldn't have to navigate

15:22.390 --> 15:24.410
huge piles of dog shit
on our lawn anymore.

15:24.420 --> 15:26.400
This could be a grand night.

15:26.410 --> 15:30.330
Well, we are going out during
Purge for the first time ever.

15:30.340 --> 15:32.410
You're saying
we should take advantage?

15:32.420 --> 15:34.370
- Huh. Okay.
- Yeah.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.390
Sorry for making you work
so close to Purge.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.410
Yeah, you're not... you're not
working all night, are you?

15:52.420 --> 15:54.320
Eh, some guys do.

15:54.330 --> 15:57.270
Driving around crazies
for that Purge surge money.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.410
Not me, though.
You guys are my last trip.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.420
I go home and lock in.

16:02.440 --> 16:06.440
I know this place...
the Stanton residence.

16:08.340 --> 16:11.520
What, is it some kind of
fancy NFFA Purge party?

16:11.530 --> 16:13.530
We don't know.
It's, uh...

16:14.250 --> 16:16.280
It's our first time being invited.

16:16.290 --> 16:20.260
Uh, Purging's not our thing.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.330
Why the hell you going, then?

16:22.340 --> 16:25.410
Uh, it's, um,
kind of a business deal.

16:25.420 --> 16:28.260
Like some New Founding Fathers shit, huh?

16:28.270 --> 16:31.280
No, it's not.
It's nothing like that.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.510
We're trying to get an investment

16:32.520 --> 16:35.270
that will help us build housing
for the poor...

16:35.280 --> 16:37.290
The less fortunate.

16:48.250 --> 16:51.500
I always wondered something
about these big parties.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.370
How can you trust anyone?

16:53.380 --> 16:55.270
We had to sign a release

16:55.280 --> 16:57.250
that guarantees
we can't Purge or be Purged.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.300
Yeah, they administer
background checks.

16:58.310 --> 16:59.410
I get it.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.320
Rich people don't kill
each other on Purge Night.

17:02.330 --> 17:05.390
- We're not rich, far from it.
- Tonight you are.

17:29.450 --> 17:32.410
First things first, team...

17:32.420 --> 17:35.350
Ryker Moore Equity is safer
than our homes tonight,

17:35.360 --> 17:37.390
so let's put the Purge
out of our minds

17:37.400 --> 17:40.470
so we can all focus on work...
Nothing else.

17:40.480 --> 17:43.410
Now, I want to stress
the following...

17:43.420 --> 17:46.300
Each of you brings something
to this deal

17:46.310 --> 17:48.310
that is integral to its closure...

17:48.320 --> 17:49.320
Closure that must happen

17:49.330 --> 17:51.430
before our markets
open in the morning.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.420
It's a lot of detailed work.

17:53.430 --> 17:57.510
Let's do it together,
and we can all be rewarded.

17:57.520 --> 18:00.390
And if we close this deal early,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
which is possible
if the Japanese markets

18:02.410 --> 18:05.470
turn in our favor,
we can do some celebrating.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.420
I brought a case of Don Julio 1942

18:08.430 --> 18:10.390
that we can all share, okay?

18:10.400 --> 18:11.500
All right, so let's get to it.

18:11.500 --> 18:14.470
Sorry to interrupt.
Excuse me.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.430
Sorry to interrupt.
Good evening, everyone.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.320
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Jane.

18:20.330 --> 18:22.270
I just wanted to thank everyone.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.460
An all-nighter is one thing, but an
all-nighter on Purge Night is another

18:23.470 --> 18:26.270
whole level of commitment,

18:26.280 --> 18:29.280
and I can't thank you enough
for doing this.

18:29.290 --> 18:31.470
It's unfortunate,
but we had no choice.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.340
Talk about bad timing.

18:33.350 --> 18:35.410
- No, David, please.
- No problem.

18:35.420 --> 18:38.350
As you know,
Jane is much smarter than me.

18:38.360 --> 18:40.350
That's why I hired her.
She makes me look good.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.460
But sometimes
a little dumbing down

18:42.470 --> 18:44.360
can't hurt to clarify things,

18:44.380 --> 18:48.390
and I'm good at dumbing,
so here goes.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.520
You'll all get larger bonuses

18:50.250 --> 18:53.360
if you close the Chiho deal
tonight, all of you.

18:53.380 --> 18:55.410
We do what we do for money,

18:55.420 --> 18:58.470
and you'll make much more
if you deliver.

19:01.380 --> 19:03.470
Great, I love it.
Let's get to work.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.310
I'll touch base later.

19:05.320 --> 19:09.440
Jane, the room is yours.
I'll get out of your way now.

19:09.450 --> 19:12.440
I forgot that you were
the eavesdropping type, David.

19:14.320 --> 19:18.490
You know, I'm always
watching and listening, Jane.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.420
Talk later.
Keep me posted.

19:23.450 --> 19:26.390
Okay, let's get to it.

19:28.410 --> 19:31.350
Come on, where are you?

20:32.380 --> 20:34.420
I told you, she's not home, babe.

20:34.430 --> 20:36.480
She's still away in Africa.

20:36.490 --> 20:39.400
Just relax, focus on why we came here.

20:39.410 --> 20:41.400
- Okay?
- Yeah.

20:43.420 --> 20:45.300
- You're clear.
- Thank you.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.410
Ma'am, hands up.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.360
Turn around, ma'am.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.420
Thank you, you're clear.

20:56.430 --> 20:59.440
Yeah.
Hands up.

21:27.260 --> 21:30.350
Hey.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.520
It's our time, sweetie...

21:32.530 --> 21:36.310
our time to escape
all the pain...

21:36.320 --> 21:40.330
to escape your father,
that monster, forever.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.470
Remember Good Leader's words?

21:44.480 --> 21:47.490
They'll guide you into the Invisible.

22:14.390 --> 22:17.250
I don't see
the Stantons anywhere.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.250
I think they've been greeting
all their guests.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.390
Why don't you go look
for Mr. Stanton, babe?

22:21.400 --> 22:22.500
The quicker we start
that conversation,

22:22.500 --> 22:24.250
the sooner we can find a room

22:24.260 --> 22:26.320
and avoid any Purging
that's going to happen.

22:26.330 --> 22:27.480
The sooner I start the conversation?

22:27.490 --> 22:31.410
What about you?
This is our company... 50/50.

22:31.420 --> 22:34.520
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm creative, you're business.

22:34.530 --> 22:36.320
You would never mess
with my designs.

22:36.330 --> 22:38.350
I don't mess with your negotiating.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.410
This is you, partner.

22:39.420 --> 22:42.380
Hey, I love you.

22:42.390 --> 22:43.460
Now go make that son of a bitch pay

22:43.470 --> 22:46.340
for making us come here
to the belly of the beast

22:46.350 --> 22:47.500
- on Purge Night.
- Mm.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.410
Oh, and don't forget...
After you close the deal,

22:49.420 --> 22:51.320
he's probably going to make a pitch

22:51.330 --> 22:52.510
for us to become
NFFA party members.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.350
No, I know, I'm ready for it.
I'll deflect my way out of it.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.340
And remember, Billy Sabian
closed a huge deal

22:58.350 --> 22:59.530
for his start-up here last year,

23:00.250 --> 23:01.450
and he didn't join, all right?

23:01.460 --> 23:03.330
So the deal's not predicated upon it.

23:03.340 --> 23:08.250
Cold, hard money drives Stanton
way more than politics.

23:08.260 --> 23:11.460
You wear that rented tux
very well, Mr. Betancourt.

23:11.470 --> 23:15.250
That is a confidence builder,
Mrs. Betancourt.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.350
Now go make our dreams
come true.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.400
Yes, ma'am.

23:27.390 --> 23:30.250
Hi. Um, seltzer with lime, please.

23:30.260 --> 23:32.360
Yes, ma'am.

23:32.380 --> 23:34.360
- Ma'am.
- I've already had some.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.400
Hors d'oeuvres, ma'am?

23:43.390 --> 23:45.340
What?

23:46.500 --> 23:49.260
No, come back here!

23:50.480 --> 23:52.410
Do you know what you did?

23:52.420 --> 23:54.500
Look at me when I talk to you!
Look at me!

23:54.510 --> 23:57.510
Do you know how long it takes?

24:26.520 --> 24:29.290
Let's go.
Up.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.440
Is Henry here?

24:35.280 --> 24:36.420
Speak.

24:36.430 --> 24:38.380
I feel like no matter what I say,

24:38.390 --> 24:39.510
you're going beat my ass...

24:39.520 --> 24:42.420
He's in there!

24:42.430 --> 24:43.430
Are you sure?

24:43.440 --> 24:46.340
Sometimes he's there,
sometimes he's not.

24:46.350 --> 24:48.330
I don't know, maybe.

24:48.340 --> 24:50.480
All right. You're my escort,
you hear me?

24:50.490 --> 24:54.250
- You're going to get me inside.
- Whoa, whoa. Ah!

24:54.250 --> 24:57.320
What? No, no, I don't think...
That is not a good idea.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.390
Walk.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.400
No, this is not a good idea.

25:07.460 --> 25:09.460
- Who is it?
- Hey, hey, hey.

25:09.470 --> 25:11.320
T, it's me, Asshole.

25:11.330 --> 25:14.400
It's all good.
I got a... I got a buddy.

25:29.340 --> 25:32.460
- Who the hell is this?
- Oh, it's me, it's cool.

25:32.470 --> 25:35.420
Lenz, this is just a buddy.
What... what's with Kaylee?

25:35.430 --> 25:38.290
Why is she cuffed?
She been dipping in your stash?

25:39.320 --> 25:41.530
No, man.
That's for her own good.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.390
We're having a little
holiday soiree later,

25:44.400 --> 25:47.420
and sweet Kaylee's going to be
our Purge dessert.

25:47.430 --> 25:49.450
You boys should come, too.

25:49.460 --> 25:52.530
It's Purge Night.
Anything goes!

25:57.270 --> 25:59.450
I'll pass.

26:01.450 --> 26:04.500
I'm looking for Henry.

26:04.510 --> 26:07.460
I'm an old friend.

26:10.440 --> 26:13.500
I know all of Henry's friends.

26:13.510 --> 26:17.270
But I don't know your ass.

26:17.280 --> 26:20.460
My ass has been away a while.

26:20.470 --> 26:24.280
Well, where's your ass been?

26:24.290 --> 26:27.260
My ass has been in the Marines.

26:32.480 --> 26:34.290
Hot shit!

26:36.480 --> 26:38.430
Yeah.

26:38.440 --> 26:40.390
Soldier boy.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.250
G.I. Joe.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.470
So, Rambo...

26:46.480 --> 26:49.530
what you want with Henry?

26:56.270 --> 26:59.430
You know, I'd like to re-connect.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.310
- You know, it's been a while.
- Look out!

27:22.460 --> 27:25.250
Help.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.470
Please.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.200
These bastards are not your friends.

27:38.650 --> 27:40.550
Never come back here.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.570
I will check and make sure
that you don't.

27:42.580 --> 27:45.580
Understand?

27:45.590 --> 27:47.780
Look at me.
Look at me.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.660
It's almost commencement.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.640
Do you have a safe place
to go tonight?

27:51.650 --> 27:53.750
My parents don't live far away.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.530
They're pretty pissed off
at me, but they'll let me in.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.530
Okay, the city's about to turn into hell.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.630
You need to go there, now.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.660
Thank you... so much.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.650
Go with your family, Kaylee, quick.

28:17.540 --> 28:20.510
There's an eerie and unsettling scene
in this neighborhood.

28:20.520 --> 28:21.670
The streets are nearly empty,

28:21.680 --> 28:25.510
as Purge commencement
is now only 35 minutes away.

28:25.520 --> 28:27.530
In the last few minutes,
we have seen a few vehicles

28:27.540 --> 28:28.720
crossing behind us and some stragglers

28:28.730 --> 28:31.550
now at this point jogging or even running

28:31.560 --> 28:33.750
to get to what we assume
is some sort of safe haven.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.750
Others have looked out from
behind mostly closed curtains,

28:36.760 --> 28:39.780
but for the most part,
this area is a ghost town.

29:00.660 --> 29:03.650
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

29:03.660 --> 29:05.500
Sorry.

29:05.500 --> 29:08.590
Uh, I just want everything
to go smoothly with this deal.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:10.570 --> 29:11.750
So Mark and I were wondering...

29:11.760 --> 29:13.750
About who's getting the VP position.

29:13.750 --> 29:17.590
This is not the time or the place
to speak about it.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.630
That's actually not what
I was going to talk about, Jane.

29:19.640 --> 29:21.660
One of the interns brought pastry.

29:21.670 --> 29:24.500
We were wondering
if you wanted any.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.680
Alison, look...

29:53.580 --> 29:55.770
Where are you, Penelope?

29:57.550 --> 29:59.510
Hey.

30:02.780 --> 30:05.530
What are you still doing here?

30:05.540 --> 30:06.680
I didn't say it in there

30:06.690 --> 30:08.580
because I didn't want them to hear.

30:08.590 --> 30:10.500
What?
Say what?

30:10.500 --> 30:12.600
I know who you're looking for...
Your sister.

30:12.610 --> 30:15.570
And I know where
you need to go, but...

30:15.580 --> 30:17.570
you ain't going to like it.

30:23.710 --> 30:26.610
Ms. Barber.

30:26.630 --> 30:28.640
It's minutes away from commencement.

30:28.650 --> 30:30.580
This is the only secure floor
in the building.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.630
I'll be fine.
Back in a few minutes.

30:32.640 --> 30:34.570
We can't guarantee your safety.

31:01.690 --> 31:04.700
Don't worry.
It's not for you.

32:05.670 --> 32:07.520
Oh, shit!

32:07.530 --> 32:08.600
Wait.

32:08.610 --> 32:11.560
I told you, no transactions
until the Purge begins.

32:11.570 --> 32:13.560
Sorry, sorry.

32:45.070 --> 32:45.780
Okay.

32:47.250 --> 32:49.250
- So sorry, miss. Are you okay?
- Oh, God.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.250
Please, don't... don't apologize.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.010
I wasn't looking
where I was going.

32:53.020 --> 32:55.110
I don't want to bother you,
but maybe you could help me.

32:55.130 --> 32:58.100
Do you have Tylenol?
I'm not feeling too well.

32:58.110 --> 33:01.100
Yes, of course.
Please follow me.

33:07.160 --> 33:10.060
It's none of my business,
but I saw what happened

33:10.070 --> 33:12.030
with Mrs. Stanton earlier.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.040
Is your wrist okay?

33:13.050 --> 33:16.160
I'm fine.
Thanks for asking.

33:16.170 --> 33:18.230
She's probably just tense and uptight

33:18.240 --> 33:20.140
and wants everything to be perfect

33:20.150 --> 33:22.160
for this stupid Purge party.

33:22.170 --> 33:25.250
It's not an excuse,
but it's something.

33:25.260 --> 33:28.150
- You don't like this night?
- No, I don't at all.

33:28.160 --> 33:31.000
I'm not even NFFA.

33:36.150 --> 33:41.040
May I ask,
why are you here, then?

33:41.050 --> 33:44.040
A business opportunity.

33:44.050 --> 33:45.270
Yeah, right.

33:45.280 --> 33:49.020
Mr. Stanton likes doing
business on Purge Night.

33:51.000 --> 33:54.030
I overhear a lot.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.130
Is there anything else
you need, Miss, um...

33:56.140 --> 33:59.130
Jenna, call me Jenna.
No, I don't need anything else.

33:59.150 --> 34:01.190
- And your name is?
- Catalina.

34:01.210 --> 34:04.170
Catalina.
It's nice to meet you.

34:04.170 --> 34:08.050
You too, Miss... Sorry, Jenna.

34:08.050 --> 34:11.170
That's okay.
Thank you. You are a lifesaver.

34:29.050 --> 34:31.070
Lila.

35:02.010 --> 35:03.210
Prognosticators are predicting

35:03.210 --> 35:05.110
a record turnout tonight.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.190
So, unless you want to release
the beast,

35:07.190 --> 35:09.210
get home ASAP,

35:09.230 --> 35:13.130
as we are minutes away
from the annual blood holiday.

36:09.130 --> 36:11.110
Is anyone here?

36:15.050 --> 36:17.110
Is anyone here, God damn it?

36:20.110 --> 36:21.210
Are you here to join us?

36:21.230 --> 36:23.130
Become our brother to serve her?

36:23.130 --> 36:25.130
Good Leader accepts one, accepts all.

36:25.130 --> 36:28.150
- What? What the hell?
- Please, join us.

36:28.170 --> 36:29.260
We always have room for more.

36:29.260 --> 36:32.010
We were just about
to lock down for the night.

36:32.010 --> 36:33.190
- Good Leader will be back...
- Shut the hell up!

36:33.210 --> 36:35.190
We didn't mean to agitate you.

36:35.190 --> 36:38.150
Agitation is never our intent.
How can we help you?

36:38.170 --> 36:40.130
I'm looking for someone...

36:40.130 --> 36:42.030
someone who might be here...
My sister.

36:46.090 --> 36:50.110
Of course.
Goddess Penny, Sister Penny.

36:50.110 --> 36:52.070
We know what happened to you
and your sister

36:52.070 --> 36:53.030
on the very first Purge.

36:53.050 --> 36:55.230
- You're both so special...
- Enough.

36:55.250 --> 36:59.150
Look, she wrote me this letter.

36:59.150 --> 37:03.000
"I'm joining them on their Anniversary...

37:03.010 --> 37:04.230
"stepping out of my flesh
and into the Giving,

37:04.230 --> 37:06.070
into the Invisible."

37:06.090 --> 37:07.230
She's talking about our parents

37:07.250 --> 37:09.150
that were killed on Purge Night years ago.

37:09.150 --> 37:11.230
So I know she's in deep shit tonight.

37:11.230 --> 37:14.030
What is the Giving?
What is the Invisible?

37:14.030 --> 37:16.090
She's Giving.
It's her time.

37:16.110 --> 37:17.230
We're not ready yet, none of us.

37:17.250 --> 37:20.230
- We're just too young now.
- What does it mean to "Give"?

37:20.250 --> 37:22.210
To help them... those in need,

37:22.210 --> 37:25.090
those have anger and hatred
in their flesh,

37:25.090 --> 37:27.030
those who must release it.

37:27.050 --> 37:29.010
I don't understand.
Is she Purging?

37:29.010 --> 37:30.130
No, never.

37:30.130 --> 37:32.230
She's being Purged upon.

37:38.210 --> 37:40.150
What is the goddamn Invisible?

37:40.170 --> 37:43.260
It's what you call Heaven,
but it's different.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.150
It's where lucky OMF Goddess Penny

37:46.150 --> 37:47.260
is going tonight...

37:47.260 --> 37:50.170
where she will rejoin your parents.

37:56.070 --> 37:58.210
Where is my sister right now?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.860
- Hi.
- Oh, God.

38:08.860 --> 38:10.780
I was just looking for you.

38:10.800 --> 38:11.940
Are you okay?
You look pale.

38:11.960 --> 38:14.900
I'm fine.
Just my stomach's upset.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.880
- Did you find him?
- Oh, I saw him.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.800
But he was busy talking to someone else,

38:18.800 --> 38:20.000
so I didn't want to interrupt.

38:20.010 --> 38:21.940
Everyone.

38:21.940 --> 38:24.860
Everyone, can I have your attention?

38:24.880 --> 38:27.920
We are just minutes away

38:27.920 --> 38:30.880
from the start of this glorious holiday.

38:30.900 --> 38:34.980
But first, I wanted to thank
all of you for coming.

38:34.980 --> 38:38.780
I am so proud to be
not only the host

38:38.800 --> 38:42.010
of our annual party, but to be,
along with my husband,

38:42.030 --> 38:45.010
co-chairs of the state's
New Founding Fathers

38:45.010 --> 38:47.030
- benefactor committee.
- Hear, hear.

38:47.030 --> 38:50.940
Most of you are major
donors to the NFFA,

38:50.960 --> 38:53.880
and those who are not
will be convinced

38:53.900 --> 38:55.780
to open their wallets later tonight.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.900
We should all feel proud of
what we've accomplished

38:59.900 --> 39:01.940
over these last few years.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.880
It's our private money,
our generous donations

39:04.880 --> 39:06.750
to the New Founding Fathers

39:06.760 --> 39:08.840
that have not only
put them in the White House,

39:08.840 --> 39:10.860
but is what keeps them there.

39:10.860 --> 39:13.880
I like to call our donations

39:13.900 --> 39:16.880
long-term ideological investments.

39:16.900 --> 39:20.840
Our support of the NFFA
helps them implement

39:20.840 --> 39:23.820
policies and programs
we believe in,

39:23.820 --> 39:25.820
including the Purge...

39:25.820 --> 39:28.030
The great liquidator of our time.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.010
"Liquidator"?

39:30.010 --> 39:32.840
Tonight on our holiday,

39:32.860 --> 39:34.880
we celebrate our accomplishments.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.000
We pat ourselves on the back

39:36.010 --> 39:39.900
because we made
this country great.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.760
So thank you.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.940
And I hope this party
is as good as last year's.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.840
Okay, okay, enough political talk.

39:47.860 --> 39:49.860
- Let's begin.
- Oh, wait.

39:49.860 --> 39:53.030
In case anyone forgot,
once we lock down,

39:53.030 --> 39:54.840
we won't be opening
the barricades

39:54.860 --> 39:57.960
until the Purge is over
for obvious safety reasons.

39:57.980 --> 40:01.750
So, uh, this is
your last chance, folks.

40:01.760 --> 40:02.940
Anyone want out?

40:14.860 --> 40:17.760
Are you sure
you want to do this?

40:17.780 --> 40:20.750
Well...

40:20.760 --> 40:22.900
yeah.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.920
Lockdown complete!

40:41.920 --> 40:44.750
Ladies, bring out the gifts.

40:46.980 --> 40:50.840
Everyone, please, take one.

40:50.840 --> 40:53.800
We have a Purge theme tonight.

40:53.820 --> 40:57.010
You'll understand
when you see it.

40:57.010 --> 41:00.880
Don't be afraid.
Go ahead.

41:00.880 --> 41:02.960
Take one.

41:02.980 --> 41:04.780
And our maids will tell you

41:04.800 --> 41:07.760
about the person
who you'll be wearing tonight.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.780
- David Berkowitz?
- Son of Sam?

41:12.780 --> 41:15.030
Are you kidding me?
This is insane.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.980
Who the hell is this?

41:17.000 --> 41:18.010
Susan Denise Atkins

41:18.010 --> 41:20.900
was a member
of the Charles Mason family,

41:20.900 --> 41:24.030
who committed nine murders
in the summer of 1969.

41:26.980 --> 41:30.030
Okay, let's just put them on
so we don't stick out.

41:31.900 --> 41:34.980
We wear these masks
to commemorate

41:34.980 --> 41:39.030
those who paved the way and Purged

41:39.750 --> 41:41.000
before it was legal.

41:41.010 --> 41:42.900
They risked their freedom

41:42.920 --> 41:44.880
because they knew
the incredible,

41:44.900 --> 41:47.920
life-changing, healing power

41:47.940 --> 41:50.980
of violence, of killing.

41:50.980 --> 41:55.980
Okay, wow. I think all of you
have your masks on now.

41:56.000 --> 41:56.960
Great.

41:56.960 --> 41:59.030
We are just seconds away now,

41:59.030 --> 42:01.800
so if you'd please direct your attention

42:01.820 --> 42:03.940
toward these screens.

42:06.980 --> 42:08.800
This is not a test.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.780
This is your emergency
broadcast system

42:10.800 --> 42:13.940
announcing the commencement
of The Annual Purge

42:13.940 --> 42:15.900
sanctioned by the U.S. government.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.030
Weapons of Class 4 and lower

42:17.750 --> 42:20.780
have been authorized for use
during the Purge.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.760
All other weapons are restricted.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.880
Government officials of ranking ten

42:24.900 --> 42:27.000
have been granted immunity
from the Purge

42:27.010 --> 42:28.840
and shall not be harmed.

42:28.860 --> 42:31.780
Commencing at the siren,
any and all crime,

42:31.800 --> 42:33.000
including murder,

42:33.010 --> 42:35.920
will be legal for 12 continuous hours.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.030
Police, fire, and emergency
medical services

42:38.030 --> 42:42.760
will be unavailable until
tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.,

42:42.760 --> 42:43.840
when The Purge concludes.

42:43.860 --> 42:46.010
Blessed be
our New Founding Fathers

42:46.010 --> 42:48.960
and America... a nation reborn.

42:48.960 --> 42:50.920
May God be with you all.

43:12.900 --> 43:14.030
Okay.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.940
Let the fun begin!

43:49.880 --> 43:51.940
My God.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.820
Maybe we should have gotten
the hell out of here.

44:06.840 --> 44:09.820
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

44:09.840 --> 44:11.820
Whoo!

44:18.940 --> 44:21.920
Purify my flesh.
Prepare my soul.

44:21.940 --> 44:24.980
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

44:24.980 --> 44:28.820
Purify my flesh.
Prepare my soul.

44:28.840 --> 44:31.800
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

44:31.800 --> 44:34.800
Purify my flesh.
Prepare my soul.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.760
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

44:38.780 --> 44:40.940
Purify my flesh.
Prepare my soul.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.940
The Giving is near.
The Invisible awaits.

44:46.030 --> 44:49.840
We need to go find Albert
and close that goddamn deal

44:49.860 --> 44:51.840
so we can...

45:36.010 --> 45:39.750
Lila, good to see you.

45:41.860 --> 45:44.010
How wonderful to see you.

45:55.860 --> 45:57.820
There's no turning back.

45:57.840 --> 45:59.820
You can follow my progress
live on the app you downloaded.

45:59.820 --> 46:01.980
- Right.
- You're our third tonight.

46:01.980 --> 46:03.010
Depending on what I run into,

46:03.030 --> 46:04.940
it may not get filled for several hours.

46:04.940 --> 46:06.010
Okay.

46:06.030 --> 46:07.800
- You got it?
- I got it.

46:17.880 --> 46:20.960
Yeah! Whoo!

46:20.980 --> 46:23.860
Look at those crazy bastards.

46:53.980 --> 46:56.820
Don't worry.
I know you will.

47:13.780 --> 47:15.780
Toward the lot.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.760
The Giving is here... now.

47:31.780 --> 47:33.960
Now we must do our duty.

47:33.980 --> 47:37.030
We help the sinners
release their hatred.

47:37.750 --> 47:40.030
We step out of our flesh
and become vessels

47:40.750 --> 47:42.780
by which to carry their sins.

47:42.800 --> 47:45.800
The Earth's children
will reap the rewards

47:45.820 --> 47:49.780
of our selflessness,
and we will exit righteously,

47:49.800 --> 47:51.960
escaping the darkness of our life

47:51.960 --> 47:55.800
and reaping the rewards
of the Invisible, my children.

47:55.820 --> 47:57.900
This one last moment of suffering

47:57.900 --> 48:00.900
will lead to eternal love.

48:21.860 --> 48:25.860
Arthur, it is your time to give.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.750
I've loved myself too much...

48:42.760 --> 48:44.860
and I've loved you all too little.

48:50.940 --> 48:54.920
Bye, Arthur.
We love you, Arthur.

48:54.920 --> 48:56.900
Enter in peace.

49:10.760 --> 49:15.030
Purify his flesh.
Cleanse his soul.

49:15.750 --> 49:19.800
The Giving is here.
The Invisible awaits.

49:19.800 --> 49:23.820
Purify his flesh.
Cleanse his soul.

49:23.840 --> 49:27.780
The Giving is here.
The Invisible awaits.

49:27.780 --> 49:31.940
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

49:31.960 --> 49:36.760
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

49:36.780 --> 49:40.760
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

49:40.780 --> 49:44.760
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

49:44.780 --> 49:48.860
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

49:48.880 --> 49:51.920
Take me to the Invisible.

49:51.940 --> 49:54.750
Take me to the Invisible.
Take me...

49:54.760 --> 49:55.920
Step into the Invisible.

49:55.920 --> 49:59.840
It's time to give.
It's time to give.

50:01.780 --> 50:02.780
It's my time to give.

50:04.840 --> 50:06.820
Step into the Invisible.

50:06.840 --> 50:09.030
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

50:09.750 --> 50:11.780
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

50:11.780 --> 50:14.880
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

50:14.900 --> 50:17.880
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

50:17.880 --> 50:20.840
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.

50:20.840 --> 50:23.760
Step into the Invisible.
Step into the Invisible.
