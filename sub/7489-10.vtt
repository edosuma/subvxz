00:02.070 --> 00:05.359
Austin and I do like each
other, but it's complicated.

00:05.360 --> 00:07.520
I think he still has
feelings for another girl.

00:07.521 --> 00:10.722
I made up my mind. I'm gonna
ask Kira to be my girlfriend.

00:10.723 --> 00:14.006
It's time for me to
face my biggest fear.

00:14.007 --> 00:15.248
I'm gonna perform on stage.

00:15.249 --> 00:20.253
<i>♪ If you wanna climb,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.322

00:22.323 --> 00:26.093
<i>♪ I'll be your road...</i>

00:26.094 --> 00:28.261
I did it! I conquered
my stage fright!

00:28.262 --> 00:31.331

00:31.332 --> 00:33.836

00:37.105 --> 00:39.120
<i>♪ You can come to me...</i>

00:39.121 --> 00:42.826
Austin? I thought about it.
Yes, I'll be your girlfriend.

00:42.827 --> 00:46.080
<i>♪ You can come to me.</i>

00:46.081 --> 00:48.301
<i>♪ Yeah...</i>

00:48.787 --> 00:50.459
Oh, uh...

00:50.460 --> 00:55.289
I guess that's the answer to the
question I asked you yesterday.

00:55.290 --> 00:57.124
And you said yes.

00:57.125 --> 00:59.126
I guess that makes it official.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.572
Congrats, you two.

01:00.573 --> 01:01.794
- Ally, I...
- Thanks!

01:01.795 --> 01:04.575
Well, I better get smooching...

01:04.575 --> 01:06.371
I mean, scooching.

01:06.372 --> 01:09.256
There's a movie I
don't wanna kiss...

01:09.257 --> 01:10.516
I mean, miss.

01:10.517 --> 01:13.697
Uh... let's go, Trish.

01:15.025 --> 01:20.925
Uh, the duet sounded great tonight, Austin,
although your timing was a little off.

01:24.598 --> 01:28.434
So Kira, about us...
I'm afraid that...

01:28.435 --> 01:32.405
I know. You're afraid my dad's gonna
be mad we're officially dating.

01:32.406 --> 01:34.307
- See, the thing is...
- Shh.

01:34.308 --> 01:36.542
Let's not worry about
my dad right now.

01:36.543 --> 01:39.603
Let's just be happy.

01:41.515 --> 01:43.272
Aw, man. This is bad.
What am I gonna...

01:43.273 --> 01:45.133
Shh.

01:45.585 --> 01:48.234
Let's not worry about
Kira and Ally right now.

01:48.235 --> 01:51.355
Let's just freak out.

01:55.876 --> 01:58.978

<i>♪ Do it without ya,

02:48.072 --> 02:50.468
So have you talked to Austin
yet about the big kiss?

02:50.469 --> 02:54.190
- What's there to talk about?
- Whoa, rewind. Kiss?

02:54.191 --> 02:58.081
Yeah yeah. Austin and I kissed
last night, but not a big deal.

02:58.082 --> 03:02.252
Oh, Sweetie! Your first kiss!
That is a big deal!

03:02.253 --> 03:05.882
What makes you think
it was my first kiss?

03:05.883 --> 03:09.025
Okay, it was my first kiss.

03:09.026 --> 03:12.146
It was pretty magical.

03:12.257 --> 03:14.012
I was there.

03:14.013 --> 03:17.377
- Yeah. I felt like Cinderella.
- Aw.

03:17.378 --> 03:20.400
Until the Prince's girlfriend showed
up, then the glass slipper broke,

03:20.401 --> 03:21.835
the pumpkin exploded
all over me,

03:21.836 --> 03:24.563
and the gingerbread man found
a wolf in grandma's house.

03:24.564 --> 03:27.920
I think you're mixing
up your fairy tales.

03:27.921 --> 03:30.921
It was pretty Grimm.

03:32.542 --> 03:34.559
Too soon?

03:34.560 --> 03:38.831
Bottom line... Austin has another
girlfriend, end of story.

03:38.832 --> 03:40.900
Oh, honey.

03:40.901 --> 03:43.043
I'm so sorry.

03:43.044 --> 03:45.740
But you've got a choice...

03:45.741 --> 03:49.885
You could think of last night as a
night that some boy let you down.

03:49.886 --> 03:54.601
Or, you can think of it as the night
that you walked out on stage,

03:54.602 --> 03:58.318
and conquered your biggest fear.

03:58.319 --> 04:02.673
Listen to your mom. You
conquered your stage fright.

04:02.674 --> 04:06.911
Let's focus on your career now. I'm gonna
be your manager. We're gonna do this!

04:06.912 --> 04:11.749
You're right. If I can beat my
stage fright, I can do anything.

04:11.750 --> 04:17.649
It's time to close the door on
Austin and open the door on me!

04:19.142 --> 04:21.314
You gotta pull.

04:21.315 --> 04:24.675
And open the door on me!

04:26.000 --> 04:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:33.427 --> 04:35.287
Woo!

04:35.471 --> 04:38.821
Tastes better when it's a challenge.
Your move.

04:38.822 --> 04:41.957
Nah, I don't feel
like playing anymore.

04:41.958 --> 04:44.760
I can't stop thinking about
the whole Ally-Kira thing.

04:44.761 --> 04:47.997
I admit, I was upset
about it at first.

04:47.998 --> 04:52.434
But if you wanna be with Kira and
not Ally, I can accept that.

04:52.435 --> 04:54.669
I don't wanna be with Kira.
I wanna be with Ally.

04:54.670 --> 05:00.370
Woo! Thank goodness because I
really couldn't accept that.

05:00.444 --> 05:03.024
Oh! Hey, Ally!

05:03.863 --> 05:06.443
Oh. Hey, guys.

05:07.380 --> 05:09.751
Do you guys wanna be alone?

05:09.752 --> 05:12.432
- Uh, yeah. Kinda.
- Cool.

05:12.433 --> 05:17.473
There's nobody sitting at
that table over there.

05:20.897 --> 05:22.817
So...

05:23.455 --> 05:25.489
Did you see Dez's
french fry building?

05:25.490 --> 05:29.159
I call it the frie-ffel tower!

05:29.160 --> 05:32.048
It was funnier when
I said it earlier.

05:32.049 --> 05:35.298
Okay. Let's not make this any
weirder than it needs to be.

05:35.299 --> 05:38.008
We kissed. It was good.

05:38.009 --> 05:41.304
- Really good.
- Okay. Really good.

05:41.305 --> 05:43.825
Magical, even.

05:44.748 --> 05:47.683
Okay. It was really
good and magical.

05:47.684 --> 05:50.562
But the point is...
you chose Kira.

05:50.563 --> 05:52.972
But let's just stick to
being friends and partners

05:52.973 --> 05:54.945
and pretend the kiss
never happened.

05:54.946 --> 05:59.113
I can't pretend it never happened.
Ally, I wanna be with you.

05:59.114 --> 06:02.092
Oh, so you broke up with Kira?

06:02.093 --> 06:04.973
Well, no. Not yet.

06:05.666 --> 06:08.066
Bye, Austin.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.000
Bummer, man. Have a fry.
It'll make you feel better.

06:19.768 --> 06:21.818
First Ally, now the fries?!

06:21.819 --> 06:25.294
Do you have to destroy
everything you touch?

06:25.295 --> 06:29.809
So if I'm gonna get Ally to change her
mind, I have to break up with Kira first.

06:29.810 --> 06:33.240
- Woo, she's gonna be mad.
- Her dad won't be too happy either.

06:33.241 --> 06:36.427
Yeah, he doesn't even
know we're dating.

06:36.428 --> 06:40.853
Wait, that's it! If Jimmy finds out,
maybe he'll do the breaking up for me.

06:40.854 --> 06:43.495
- Mmm!
- Good idea, huh?

06:43.496 --> 06:47.576
No, I'm just enjoying my fry.
Mmm!

06:52.144 --> 06:56.716
I hereby call this first official
team Ally meeting to order.

06:56.717 --> 07:00.218
- Everyone take a seat.
- Everyone's sitting.

07:00.219 --> 07:02.633
Let's hear from our songwriter.

07:02.634 --> 07:05.639
That's me. I just
wrote a new song.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.874
And now from our performer.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.155
Again, me.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.031
The vocals are
coming along great.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.342
And now from our manager. Trish?

07:15.343 --> 07:19.528
Well, I've got big plans for your
future as a superstar performer.

07:19.529 --> 07:23.595
I've devised a one-year plan
to get you from here to here!

07:23.596 --> 07:28.300
- Okay. What's the plan?
- Not a clue. But you end up here!

07:28.301 --> 07:30.778
I am so excited!

07:30.779 --> 07:33.672
Well, I have already thought
of some Ally merchandise.

07:33.673 --> 07:35.251
Hmm.

07:35.252 --> 07:37.652
Ally sponge.

07:37.744 --> 07:40.024
Ally soap.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.713
Ally plunger.

07:41.714 --> 07:46.154
Ally toilet paper.
Single and double-ply.

07:46.876 --> 07:50.373
Did you just steal all that stuff from
our bathroom and write my name on it?

07:50.374 --> 07:54.190
Yup, that's the kind of
can-do manager I am.

07:54.191 --> 07:57.256
I also called Megan from "Cheetah
Beat" to get you an interview.

07:57.257 --> 08:01.543
Great job, Trish. Day one
progress report... amazing.

08:01.544 --> 08:06.799
And from there, I'm thinking concerts,
a record deal and some dance lessons!

08:06.800 --> 08:10.377
Because let's be honest, this...

08:10.378 --> 08:13.198
Isn't cutting it.

08:18.453 --> 08:21.588
- Hey, boyfriend.
- Hey, Kira.

08:21.589 --> 08:24.469
Boyfriend boyfriend boyfriend.

08:24.470 --> 08:25.759
I like the sound of that.

08:25.760 --> 08:29.661
It's a great word when
used appropriately.

08:29.662 --> 08:33.458
I couldn't agree
more, boyfriend.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.985
Listen, I know we said
we were gonna wait,

08:35.986 --> 08:38.605
but I think we need to
tell your dad about us.

08:38.606 --> 08:42.147
Aren't you worried he's gonna
stop us from seeing each other?

08:42.148 --> 08:46.358
That's a chance I'm
willing to take.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.715
Hey, there he is.

08:48.716 --> 08:50.487
Daddy?

08:50.488 --> 08:53.264
What a coincidence
seeing you here!

08:53.265 --> 08:55.675
You texted me to meet you here.

08:55.676 --> 08:57.601
Did I? Anyway...

08:57.602 --> 08:59.603
The important thing
is that you're here.

08:59.604 --> 09:02.898
And there's something that we'd
like to talk to you about.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.148
I'm listening.

09:04.149 --> 09:06.672
There's a good chance
you're gonna be really,

09:06.673 --> 09:09.206
really upset about what
I'm about to tell you.

09:09.207 --> 09:11.021
Is there a point to this?

09:11.022 --> 09:13.796
I think you should know
that me and Kira...

09:13.797 --> 09:16.213
Your only daughter...

09:16.214 --> 09:18.081
Are dating.

09:18.082 --> 09:21.849
And we wouldn't want to continue
without your approval, so...

09:21.850 --> 09:25.926
I have a strict policy against
my daughter dating musicians.

09:25.927 --> 09:29.173
- No exceptions.
- Aw. No exceptions?

09:29.174 --> 09:32.913
I gotta say, the fact that you called
me down here to ask my permission.

09:32.914 --> 09:35.379
Proves that you're the kind of
guy my daughter should be with.

09:35.380 --> 09:39.357
I'm sorry you feel that way...
wait. What?

09:39.358 --> 09:41.935
You and Kira have my blessing.

09:41.936 --> 09:44.388
- Group hug.
- Yay!

09:44.389 --> 09:46.729
Wait. What?

09:55.904 --> 09:59.859
- How's the new song coming?
- Oh, great! I'm almost done.

09:59.860 --> 10:04.936
Well, guess who got her first interview
as a performer? Megan's on her way up.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.533
That's awesome! Thanks, Trish.

10:07.534 --> 10:09.411
I'm really excited
about this interview.

10:09.412 --> 10:12.803
It'll be nice to talk about just Ally.
Not Austin and Ally.

10:12.804 --> 10:14.425
O.M.G.!

10:14.426 --> 10:17.104
I wanna talk about
Austin and Ally.

10:17.105 --> 10:18.715
I heard you guys sang a duet.

10:18.716 --> 10:21.318
Are you a couple? An item?
A thing?!

10:21.319 --> 10:25.422
Whoa! Someone put too much
sugar on their cereal.

10:25.423 --> 10:28.191
I brought you here to write
about Ally's new career.

10:28.192 --> 10:31.228
And I will, but my
readers want the gossip.

10:31.229 --> 10:35.584
I don't know much about chemistry, because
you don't take that till the eighth grade,

10:35.585 --> 10:38.949
but I know that you two have it.

10:38.950 --> 10:42.080
That's nice of you to say, but
Austin's dating somebody else.

10:42.081 --> 10:44.341
Trust me, we're just partners.

10:44.342 --> 10:47.244
So he does have a girlfriend!

10:47.245 --> 10:49.645
Totes juice!

10:49.679 --> 10:52.515
Now that we got the gossip out of
the way, can we focus on Ally?

10:52.516 --> 10:58.416
Of course. Next week. But right
now, I have an epic story to break.

11:01.919 --> 11:04.979
So... that went well.

11:08.691 --> 11:10.600
Did you break up with her yet?

11:10.601 --> 11:13.967
I tried to, but it
didn't go so well.

11:13.968 --> 11:16.533
Hey, boyfriend.

11:16.534 --> 11:17.963
Hey, Kira.

11:17.964 --> 11:21.438
Listen, I need to
tell you something.

11:21.439 --> 11:24.439
I think we should...

11:34.285 --> 11:36.685
So anyway...

11:38.211 --> 11:39.812
Please don't hate me.

11:39.813 --> 11:42.671
Sorry, I couldn't hear
anything you said.

11:42.672 --> 11:46.958
Why would I hate you?
You're my boyfriend.

11:46.959 --> 11:48.811
What I was trying to say is...

11:48.812 --> 11:51.767
I think we should...

11:51.768 --> 11:53.253
Hi, Daddy.

11:53.254 --> 11:57.694
What? That's awful.
I'll be right home.

11:57.733 --> 12:00.395
My goldfish Mr. Gills just died.

12:00.396 --> 12:03.256
I gotta go. What did
you want to tell me?

12:03.257 --> 12:06.257
That I'm sorry for your loss?

12:06.258 --> 12:08.538
Mr. Gills!

12:08.634 --> 12:11.274
Mr. Gills died?

12:11.818 --> 12:14.003
I loved that fish.

12:14.004 --> 12:16.995
Anyway, I'm gonna meet
up with her again.

12:16.996 --> 12:18.684
I gotta get this over with.

12:18.685 --> 12:20.350
Austin Moon!

12:20.351 --> 12:22.964
Word on the street... you
have a new girlfriend.

12:22.965 --> 12:26.862
And I'm here to get the deets, the
skinny, the 411, the juice...

12:26.863 --> 12:30.823
The information to
write my story.

12:30.973 --> 12:32.623
What?

12:32.624 --> 12:35.501
That is totes ridic.

12:35.502 --> 12:39.297
And isn't there something more interesting
to write about than my private life?

12:39.298 --> 12:40.701
Nope.

12:40.702 --> 12:44.764
Uh well, I gotta go do
something really boring.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.883
But I'll, uh, see you later.

12:47.884 --> 12:50.704
Dez, walk me out?

12:51.261 --> 12:54.446
I have to go break up with Kira and
I don't want Megan interfering.

12:54.447 --> 12:57.166
I need you to keep
her away from me.

12:57.167 --> 13:02.120
I'm on it. Megan... who wants a stick?
Who wants a stick?

13:02.121 --> 13:04.456
Go get it! Go get it!

13:04.457 --> 13:08.597
Now's your chance.
Get out of here!

13:11.846 --> 13:14.726
Ugh! I'll get it.

13:19.205 --> 13:22.891
So anyway, that's what I've been
trying to tell you all week.

13:22.892 --> 13:26.211
- Please don't hate me.
- I don't hate you, Austin.

13:26.212 --> 13:28.313
I mean, I wanna yell
and scream at you,

13:28.314 --> 13:31.249
but I know that's not gonna
make me feel better.

13:31.250 --> 13:37.150
- Wow, you're being so cool about it...
- You inconsiderate...

13:46.729 --> 13:48.589
Woo!

13:48.613 --> 13:51.253
That felt good.

13:51.778 --> 13:54.584
- Are we cool now?
- Yeah.

13:54.585 --> 13:56.333
You're still working
with my dad and,

13:56.334 --> 13:58.723
there's no reason we shouldn't
try and be friends.

13:58.724 --> 14:01.484
You're the best.

14:04.453 --> 14:07.565
O.M.G. His girlfriend's
Kira Starr?!

14:07.566 --> 14:10.746
Can you say exclusive?!

14:17.743 --> 14:22.892
I am so proud of Ally for
getting over her stage fright.

14:22.893 --> 14:25.516
We should throw her a
party to celebrate.

14:25.517 --> 14:29.356
Great idea! We can do it
outside in the Mall for free.

14:29.357 --> 14:32.656
- Let's get started.
- Come on.

14:32.657 --> 14:34.785
Hey. How's it going?

14:34.786 --> 14:35.872
Great.

14:35.873 --> 14:39.383
I just finished a new song for myself and
did an interview for "Cheetah Beat".

14:39.384 --> 14:42.929
That's awesome! I'm really
happy for you, Ally.

14:42.930 --> 14:46.837
Listen, I just want you to know that
Kira's completely out of the picture.

14:46.838 --> 14:48.703
Really?

14:48.704 --> 14:52.784
Seriously? "Austin's
new girlfriend"?

14:53.151 --> 14:55.368
Looks like she's still
in the picture to me.

14:55.369 --> 14:57.537
Come on, Trish.

14:57.538 --> 14:59.878
Ally, wait!

15:00.474 --> 15:02.174
Austin, I gotta warn you!

15:02.175 --> 15:06.479
Megan took pictures of you and
Kira to publish in "Cheetah Beat".

15:06.480 --> 15:08.214
Oh.

15:08.215 --> 15:10.915
You already know.

15:10.916 --> 15:12.716
Aw.

15:21.328 --> 15:25.916
Hey! I've got some ideas for some
publicity shots. Check it out.

15:25.917 --> 15:28.317
Rocker Ally!

15:28.897 --> 15:31.237
Country Ally!

15:31.238 --> 15:33.796
And my personal favorite...

15:33.797 --> 15:36.532
Dragon slayer Ally!

15:36.533 --> 15:38.575
Nobody's gonna believe
I'm a dragon slayer.

15:38.576 --> 15:43.383
Ally's a dragon slayer? I
knew dragons were real.

15:43.384 --> 15:45.964
Uh. Hey, Ally.

15:46.219 --> 15:49.389
Maybe we can hook up later
and work on some new songs.

15:49.390 --> 15:52.661
Yeah, me and Trish have to come up
with some better publicity photos.

15:52.662 --> 15:56.429
- Hey!
- But let's catch up later.

15:56.430 --> 15:59.499
Man! I really messed
up with Ally.

15:59.500 --> 16:03.202
- I wish she wasn't so over me.
- Hey, don't give up now.

16:03.203 --> 16:08.932
You're Austin Moon. You can win her over.
All you need is a big romantic gesture.

16:08.933 --> 16:11.812
I could buy her a piano she could
play at her first concert.

16:11.813 --> 16:15.147
Gah, you clearly know
nothing about romance.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.874
You gotta think bigger!

16:16.875 --> 16:21.082
Like parachute the piano into the party and
then serenade her in front of everyone.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.155
Oh! That's genius!

16:23.156 --> 16:27.047
That's why they call me...
the love whisperer.

16:27.048 --> 16:30.408
No one... calls you that.

16:39.714 --> 16:45.614
Ally, your father and I are so proud of
you for overcoming your stage fright.

16:45.653 --> 16:49.893
We can't wait to see what the next
step will be in your musical journey.

16:49.894 --> 16:52.744
Ally, I love you, honey.
Come here.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.824
Oh, I hope you enjoy
this party...

16:54.825 --> 16:59.925
At which there is a two
shrimp limit per person.

17:02.045 --> 17:05.585
Uh, can I say a few words?

17:07.217 --> 17:11.019
Ally, I just wanna say
that I'm so happy for you.

17:11.020 --> 17:14.256
And I can't wait to be in the
front row of your first concert.

17:14.257 --> 17:16.023
When you're playing this!

17:16.025 --> 17:18.185
Look up!

17:18.487 --> 17:20.962
What is that?

17:20.963 --> 17:24.132
I think it's a piano.

17:24.133 --> 17:27.435
- Dez, the parachute's not open.
- Yeah, it hasn't been pulled yet.

17:27.436 --> 17:30.497
Who's gonna pull it?

17:31.333 --> 17:33.193
Run!

17:47.090 --> 17:49.670
Uh... surprise.

17:52.279 --> 17:55.519
Ally, I'm really sorry.

17:59.269 --> 18:01.609
I should...

18:10.980 --> 18:13.379
I'm really sorry, man.

18:13.380 --> 18:16.179
I blew it. She
probably hates me.

18:16.180 --> 18:19.900
Well, you did break her piano.

18:21.224 --> 18:26.228
You know, I'll never forget that
first time we wrote a song together.

18:26.229 --> 18:28.400
I was playing the piano...

18:28.401 --> 18:31.304
She was writing in her songbook.

18:31.305 --> 18:34.947
Hey, that's the card from
the flowers I got her.

18:34.948 --> 18:38.173
"There's no way I could
make it without you".

18:38.174 --> 18:40.634
She kept it.

18:41.010 --> 18:44.693
This must be the song
she's working on.

18:44.694 --> 18:47.090
Dez, listen to this...

18:47.091 --> 18:51.332
"I think about you every
morning when I open my eyes".

18:51.333 --> 18:56.797
"I think about you every
moment, every day of my life".

18:56.798 --> 18:59.858
This song is amazing.

19:00.096 --> 19:04.878
- Wait, do you know what this means?!
- That you're really nosy.

19:04.879 --> 19:06.229
No.

19:06.230 --> 19:11.322
It means no matter what she said,
she's liked me this whole time.

19:11.323 --> 19:14.678
It's like I'm watching the
best romantic movie ever!

19:14.679 --> 19:18.159
I know what I need to do.

19:22.458 --> 19:27.678
Hey. I think I found a
piece without piano in it.

19:28.157 --> 19:30.077
Nope.

19:36.032 --> 19:38.638

Just come here.

21:48.025 --> 21:50.605
I am freaking!

21:51.495 --> 21:54.795
Where did she come from?

21:59.866 --> 22:02.513
Guess who's on the cover
of "Cheetah Beat"?

22:02.514 --> 22:06.277
I guess we're
officially a couple.

22:06.278 --> 22:10.984
Finished! Woo! Fixed the
piano, good as new.
