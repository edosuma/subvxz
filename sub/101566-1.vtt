01:24.026 --> 01:27.262
Name two
parts of the flower's carpel.

01:29.097 --> 01:30.232
Stigma and style.

01:31.099 --> 01:32.267
Good.

01:32.301 --> 01:36.038
And why do flowers
have color and smell?

01:37.039 --> 01:38.708
To make them
beautiful and lovely.

01:38.741 --> 01:41.009
No.

01:41.043 --> 01:42.412
To attract insects.

01:44.547 --> 01:46.516
So, to be destroyed?

01:48.050 --> 01:49.419
Part of the flower has to die

01:49.452 --> 01:52.287
in order for what's left
to become a new fruit.

01:57.494 --> 01:58.293
Secure?

02:18.481 --> 02:19.314
Lara!

02:27.824 --> 02:29.057
Lara!

02:43.840 --> 02:46.809
There are still wild flowers.

02:46.843 --> 02:48.611
The almanac did
predict a late autumn.

02:48.645 --> 02:49.679
It's not often wrong.

02:50.713 --> 02:51.614
Can't believe it.

02:52.749 --> 02:55.518
68 days and now only 12 left
until Charlotte arrives.

02:57.185 --> 02:58.621
Isn't it funny?

02:58.655 --> 03:01.457
It felt like such a lifetime
ago and now it's nearly here.

03:01.491 --> 03:03.191
Yes, it'll be good for you

03:03.225 --> 03:04.427
to have a companion
for a few months,

03:04.460 --> 03:07.329
if nothing else to stop all
this incessant daydreaming.

03:07.362 --> 03:09.097
Well, I
have a list of things

03:09.131 --> 03:10.733
for us to do during her stay.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.234
Do you?

03:16.906 --> 03:18.841
I know, Miss Fontaine.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.677
Pick that up, please.

03:22.812 --> 03:25.548
Charlotte and I can
try on each other's dresses.

03:28.216 --> 03:30.352
Lara, I know you're excited
about Charlotte's visit,

03:30.386 --> 03:33.121
but your father might not
appreciate such idle chatter.

04:03.753 --> 04:04.854
Where do spirits go?

04:07.657 --> 04:09.157
The good ones go up.

04:10.493 --> 04:11.761
Up to the hills?

04:11.794 --> 04:12.729
Even further.

04:14.329 --> 04:15.163
To heaven.

04:23.205 --> 04:25.808
Have you written Charlotte
a welcome letter?

04:25.842 --> 04:27.910
You'll have time when
you change for dinner.

04:59.008 --> 05:02.177
Thank
you, Margaret.

05:22.297 --> 05:24.834
Lord, we thank you
for these gifts

05:24.867 --> 05:26.268
of your bounty at our table.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.942
And as you've so provided
for us in the past,

05:34.309 --> 05:38.280
we pray that you sustain
us throughout our lives,

05:40.616 --> 05:44.854
as you shall sustain us
in the life everlasting.

05:47.557 --> 05:48.391
Amen.

07:09.005 --> 07:10.338
What's that?

07:10.372 --> 07:11.007
Nothing.

07:23.452 --> 07:24.720
We talked about this, Lara.

07:29.926 --> 07:32.461
These are not images
for a young lady.

07:35.965 --> 07:37.365
You have nothing to say?

07:39.702 --> 07:44.440
You took a book from your
father's study without asking,

07:44.473 --> 07:48.711
kept it for who knows
how long, hidden away,

07:48.744 --> 07:52.782
proving you knew it was wrong,
and yet you did it anyway.

07:55.751 --> 07:56.586
Stand up.

08:03.860 --> 08:04.694
Palm.

08:18.908 --> 08:19.742
Look at me.

08:31.020 --> 08:33.389
Now, I will pray hard
for you tonight, Lara.

08:35.024 --> 08:38.159
Pray hard that these images
don't visit your night terrors.

08:40.563 --> 08:44.200
You're playing with fire,
Lara, you and your left hand.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.568
Playing with the devil.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.575
Now, you pray hard too.

08:56.512 --> 08:57.513
Pray hard.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.421
Pray hard, Lara.

I'll make

10:59.702 --> 11:00.970
A letter's arrived for you.

11:07.676 --> 11:08.478
What is it?

11:08.512 --> 11:11.580
Charlotte
has taken ill.

11:11.614 --> 11:13.082
Does it
say what's wrong with her?

11:13.115 --> 11:14.750
Mm.

11:14.784 --> 11:17.153
Just they will all have
to call off their visit.

11:21.190 --> 11:22.792
I'll find
the right time to tell her.

11:22.825 --> 11:25.728
Would
you? Thank you.

14:22.104 --> 14:25.107
Said your prayers?

14:31.814 --> 14:33.916
You're terribly
disappointed, aren't you?

14:36.885 --> 14:38.787
You do understand why, though?

14:44.159 --> 14:45.227
It's my fault.

14:52.134 --> 14:52.968
No.

14:57.006 --> 14:58.841
Charlotte's fallen ill.

14:58.874 --> 15:01.143
It would be irresponsible
for her to travel now.

15:02.845 --> 15:04.780
She was coming
and now she's not.

15:07.249 --> 15:08.451
It's what you said.

15:10.620 --> 15:11.554
I called the devil.

15:13.088 --> 15:14.290
It's because of me.

15:14.323 --> 15:15.458
It's true.

15:15.492 --> 15:16.325
Shh.

15:17.159 --> 15:19.828
Hey.

15:19.862 --> 15:21.230
Now, now, now, now.

15:27.303 --> 15:28.571
Oh, Lara.

15:30.573 --> 15:35.144
You keep to my rules
and all will be well.

15:35.177 --> 15:35.978
Hmm?

15:37.246 --> 15:38.548
All will be well.

15:40.617 --> 15:43.252
I won't let the devil
into this house.

15:43.285 --> 15:44.820
Don't you worry about that.

15:47.657 --> 15:49.825
I'll always care for you, Lara.

15:51.327 --> 15:52.595
Always protect you.

15:54.664 --> 15:56.599
You're always safe with me.

15:56.633 --> 15:57.833
Do you hear?

16:21.990 --> 16:23.359
This belonged to your mother.

16:25.294 --> 16:28.197
I thought you might
like to have it.

16:33.470 --> 16:38.475
Now, the brooch and the
fur must stay together.

16:40.976 --> 16:42.044
Don't ask me why.

16:43.380 --> 16:48.117
Your mother had certain
peculiarities not to be questioned,

16:50.319 --> 16:55.324
not even in her absence.

17:03.132 --> 17:04.031
Good night.

17:50.312 --> 17:51.714
Watch the sides.

17:51.748 --> 17:54.384
Watch the sides.

17:58.788 --> 18:01.056
Watch your step.

18:01.089 --> 18:05.628
Poor thing.

18:07.095 --> 18:09.264
Bring her in.

18:09.298 --> 18:10.533
Is she all right?

18:10.567 --> 18:11.734
Careful with her.

18:11.768 --> 18:13.202
Is she breathing?

18:13.235 --> 18:14.437
- Is she all right?
- Gently with her.

18:14.471 --> 18:16.071
Take her
up the east stairs.

18:16.104 --> 18:17.440
What
about the driver?

18:17.474 --> 18:18.373
I don't know.

18:18.408 --> 18:19.609
Leave a light burning.

18:19.642 --> 18:21.611
He may have gone for help.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.449
Back to your
room, immediately.

18:29.486 --> 18:30.319
Lara.

19:21.571 --> 19:23.506
Poor fella.

19:23.540 --> 19:26.442
Just
bad luck, I guess.

19:28.110 --> 19:30.345
All right?

19:30.380 --> 19:33.315
She's not half rich,
I can say that.

19:33.348 --> 19:36.285
Wonder if there's
any documents in this mess.

19:36.318 --> 19:37.620
Expect there's a family name

19:37.654 --> 19:38.755
in there somewhere.

19:38.788 --> 19:40.590
We'll have a look.

19:40.623 --> 19:41.791
Aye.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.314
She seems to be unscathed.

21:13.549 --> 21:15.350
Her breathing is regular.

21:15.385 --> 21:17.252
No broken bones?

21:17.285 --> 21:18.286
Doesn't appear so.

21:19.589 --> 21:21.223
What should we do now?

21:21.256 --> 21:23.358
Try not to disturb her.

21:23.393 --> 21:26.562
Cases like this,
they just need time.

21:28.998 --> 21:31.934
Put water to her lips
five times a day.

21:31.968 --> 21:32.802
Like this.

21:38.306 --> 21:39.709
Everyone stay quiet, please.

21:46.248 --> 21:47.315
I am Dr. Renquist.

21:49.986 --> 21:50.920
Can you speak?

21:57.960 --> 22:00.228
How many people can you
see here in this room?

22:08.270 --> 22:09.439
She may be in shock.

22:10.773 --> 22:11.774
Don't be frightened.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.347
There
was some commotion

22:19.382 --> 22:20.783
about the house last night.

22:21.851 --> 22:23.419
There was a carriage crash

22:24.620 --> 22:27.690
involving a young lady
round about your age.

22:29.357 --> 22:31.961
She was in a desperate
state when she arrived,

22:31.994 --> 22:34.329
first unconscious,
then unable to speak,

22:34.362 --> 22:37.800
but Dr. Renquist believes she
will be fine, God willing.

22:38.935 --> 22:41.971
She just needs rest,
peace and quiet.

22:43.338 --> 22:44.306
So until we have ascertained

22:44.339 --> 22:46.308
the identity of this young lady,

22:46.341 --> 22:48.544
she will remain
here as our guest.

22:50.012 --> 22:51.848
I've put her in the room at
the top of the east stairs

22:51.881 --> 22:53.883
to keep her as far
away as possible

22:53.916 --> 22:57.019
from any household commotion.

22:57.053 --> 23:00.423
It is imperative
she not be disturbed.

23:01.758 --> 23:03.693
She's in a very
sensitive state, Lara,

23:03.726 --> 23:05.928
so don't even ask
if you may see her.

23:37.860 --> 23:42.865
Lara!

23:48.805 --> 23:49.438
Lara.

23:50.973 --> 23:52.074
Even though there are no lines,

23:52.108 --> 23:53.976
you still must
pretend there are.

23:58.948 --> 23:59.749
For example...

24:04.787 --> 24:05.621
Go on.

24:07.657 --> 24:08.491
Tell me.

24:09.926 --> 24:13.361
You've been daydreaming
since our latest arrival,

24:13.396 --> 24:16.032
and while I understand
your anticipation,

24:16.065 --> 24:18.968
you seem to be curious about
something, so, go on, ask.

24:22.672 --> 24:24.440
Have you ever met Charlotte?

24:25.441 --> 24:26.075
I have not.

24:29.645 --> 24:31.113
Do you think the
girl who crashed

24:31.147 --> 24:34.851
in the carriage is Charlotte?

24:34.884 --> 24:35.718
No, I do not.

24:36.819 --> 24:37.653
Why?

24:40.489 --> 24:42.124
Your father has
met the Duval girl.

24:42.158 --> 24:43.358
He would recognize her.

24:44.827 --> 24:46.796
Why do you think it
could be Charlotte?

24:49.899 --> 24:52.668
I thought a miracle happened

24:52.702 --> 24:56.672
and maybe Charlotte got better,

24:56.706 --> 25:01.444
or perhaps still ill, and
she decided to sneak off

25:01.477 --> 25:05.548
and got into the carriage
and set out on the road,

25:05.581 --> 25:07.450
and she pressed her
carriage driver to go

25:07.483 --> 25:10.152
as fast as he could to
get here by daybreak,

25:10.186 --> 25:12.722
and that's what
caused the crash.

25:14.624 --> 25:16.893
Thought she was so
excited and determined

25:16.926 --> 25:20.529
to stay here that
that's what happened,

25:20.563 --> 25:23.499
and you and Father
were hiding her from me

25:23.532 --> 25:25.434
because you knew
she couldn't come,

25:25.468 --> 25:27.103
but you didn't want
to disappoint me.

25:29.538 --> 25:30.539
Oh, child.

25:33.075 --> 25:35.478
That's not what happened.

25:35.511 --> 25:37.880
Your thoughts have run
off with themselves.

25:39.882 --> 25:42.151
We don't know who she
is, I can assure you,

25:45.488 --> 25:48.524
nor her driver,
God rest his soul.

25:53.496 --> 25:54.897
Now, have you chosen
a poetry piece

25:54.931 --> 25:56.933
to practice your elocution?

25:56.966 --> 25:58.567
I thought maybe a sonnet.

25:58.601 --> 25:59.435
Excellent.

26:00.269 --> 26:01.070
Nice and simple.

26:02.872 --> 26:06.542
Why don't you go to your
room and begin memorizing?

26:06.575 --> 26:07.610
I have errands to run.

28:52.775 --> 28:54.076
Miss Fontaine?

28:57.346 --> 28:58.714
Miss Fontaine.

29:02.452 --> 29:03.352
Are you in a rush?

29:04.421 --> 29:05.721
How's the patient?

29:07.424 --> 29:10.993
She's perfect,
except that she won't speak.

29:11.961 --> 29:13.762
You almost sound disappointed.

29:15.164 --> 29:16.699
Having seen the fate
of the poor driver,

29:16.732 --> 29:19.735
I would say she's as
lucky as an angel.

29:20.870 --> 29:23.072
Isn't the expression,
"the luck of the devil"?

29:25.741 --> 29:26.642
She's too pretty.

29:27.611 --> 29:29.812
Tell me, why is that
men are so easily swayed

29:29.845 --> 29:31.414
at the sight of a pretty face?

29:32.748 --> 29:35.184
Not I.

29:35.217 --> 29:36.785
No?

29:36.819 --> 29:37.653
No.

29:38.921 --> 29:41.123
No, I see the same
devil lying in that bed

29:41.157 --> 29:42.392
as you do, Miss Fontaine.

29:45.127 --> 29:46.128
Don't be absurd.

29:46.162 --> 29:47.397
I don't see...

29:47.430 --> 29:49.732
She's just a girl,
a girl like Lara.

29:50.500 --> 29:51.734
I'm teasing.

29:55.804 --> 30:00.443
Lara might have a playmate
after all instead of Charlotte.

30:01.310 --> 30:02.144
And what of Charlotte?

30:07.750 --> 30:09.084
Well, there have been rumors.

30:11.787 --> 30:13.722
What rumors?

30:13.756 --> 30:16.292
Superstitions about...

30:17.494 --> 30:19.295
For that there is
no medical remedy.

30:21.398 --> 30:23.132
Miss Fontaine, in these times,

30:24.900 --> 30:26.068
you would be
hard-pressed to find

30:26.101 --> 30:28.037
another household
taking in a stranger.

31:33.570 --> 31:36.905
Lara, do...

31:38.307 --> 31:40.009
You all right?

31:40.042 --> 31:40.876
Yes.

31:42.111 --> 31:44.414
You just startled me is all.

31:47.850 --> 31:49.018
You said your prayers?

31:51.320 --> 31:54.923
We shall say a prayer together
for that poor young girl.

32:18.515 --> 32:19.348
Good.

32:32.227 --> 32:32.828
Good night.

34:35.150 --> 34:38.020
Why is your family
keeping me in that room?

34:43.793 --> 34:45.194
It's for your safety.

34:46.728 --> 34:48.565
Lots of danger in
this house, is there?

34:50.632 --> 34:53.034
You're not from
around here, are you?

34:54.771 --> 34:58.106
A girl from the town
over, Charlotte Duval,

34:59.308 --> 35:01.478
she was supposed to stay
with us for several months.

35:04.112 --> 35:07.584
But it seems as though she's
not the only one recently.

35:13.656 --> 35:15.157
You haven't told me your name.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.596
Do you remember your name?

35:23.666 --> 35:25.100
Well, we have to
call you something.

35:26.268 --> 35:27.069
Choose.

35:28.771 --> 35:29.706
I can't name you.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.408
Sure you can.

35:32.442 --> 35:34.276
I'm sure you've
named things before.

35:35.678 --> 35:40.416
Fish and birds and
such, but never a person.

35:40.450 --> 35:43.352
But you said it yourself,
you have to call me something.

35:48.190 --> 35:49.191
Valerie?

35:50.493 --> 35:51.494
Clarissa.

35:52.361 --> 35:53.195
Carmilla.

35:54.531 --> 35:55.364
Claire.

35:57.433 --> 35:58.367
Carmilla.

35:59.736 --> 36:00.603
Carmilla.

36:05.374 --> 36:06.609
I should return to my room.

36:06.643 --> 36:07.477
Wait.

36:08.645 --> 36:10.446
You mustn't tell of this.

36:12.749 --> 36:13.583
I won't.

36:15.183 --> 36:16.853
It's our secret.

38:29.351 --> 38:30.420
She speaks.

38:31.688 --> 38:34.791
She's speaking.

38:34.824 --> 38:35.825
She can speak.

38:35.858 --> 38:37.225
Miss Fontaine.

38:38.695 --> 38:39.862
She can speak.

38:42.364 --> 38:46.769
I'm Miss Fontaine,
governess of this house,

38:46.803 --> 38:48.236
of the Bauer estate.

38:50.338 --> 38:51.574
We're here to help you,

38:53.308 --> 38:56.512
help you recover and
find your family.

38:58.648 --> 38:59.649
Do you understand?

39:01.784 --> 39:02.919
How are you feeling?

39:08.858 --> 39:10.526
Do you know what
happened to you?

39:11.894 --> 39:13.328
How you got here?

39:16.032 --> 39:17.533
What is your name?

39:17.567 --> 39:18.701
Shall we start there?

39:18.735 --> 39:22.538
Can you at least recall
what your name is?

39:22.572 --> 39:23.406
Yes.

39:25.475 --> 39:28.010
So what is it?

39:28.044 --> 39:29.846
Carmilla.

39:29.879 --> 39:32.815
Well, Carmilla, do
you, for instance,

39:32.849 --> 39:34.650
know where you're from,

39:35.985 --> 39:37.319
who your family is?

39:39.055 --> 39:40.690
This is all so confusing.

39:43.426 --> 39:44.460
Yes, of course.

39:47.063 --> 39:48.831
Well, you're safe
and sound here.

39:50.332 --> 39:53.603
I will have some
inquiries made in the area.

39:54.771 --> 39:56.639
You will stay here
until we can reunite

39:56.672 --> 39:58.074
you with your family,

39:58.107 --> 40:02.645
and hopefully, over that
time, your memory will return.

40:02.678 --> 40:03.679
You are most kind.

40:04.647 --> 40:05.481
Good.

40:11.454 --> 40:13.321
Do I have to
stay in this room?

40:24.400 --> 40:28.704
I understand your eagerness,
but you should rest.

40:28.738 --> 40:29.572
Perhaps tomorrow.

40:32.408 --> 40:33.442
No need to rush anything.

40:37.980 --> 40:40.483
You've been through so much.

40:59.035 --> 40:59.836
Shh.

41:24.894 --> 41:25.728
Welcome.

41:26.662 --> 41:28.865
I gave her one of
Lara's dresses to wear.

41:28.898 --> 41:30.633
Hope you don't
mind, Miss Fontaine.

41:31.767 --> 41:32.668
Oh.

41:32.702 --> 41:33.536
Oh!

41:40.476 --> 41:42.078
Bring us some tea,
please, Margaret.

41:46.015 --> 41:50.820
Now, Mr. Bauer is
departing momentarily.

41:52.555 --> 41:55.691
He will do everything he can
to find your next of kin.

41:55.725 --> 41:58.494
But we are so pleased you've
made such a swift recovery.

41:58.527 --> 42:00.029
We'll have you back where
you belong in no time.

42:00.062 --> 42:01.230
Won't we, Lara?

42:01.264 --> 42:03.799
May I take Carmilla outside
and show her the grounds?

42:03.833 --> 42:05.968
Yes, but you must
be back in time

42:06.002 --> 42:08.537
for some tea, please.

42:14.844 --> 42:17.847
Miss Fontaine says at
the top of those hills,

42:17.880 --> 42:19.548
there are these mounds.

42:19.582 --> 42:21.584
She calls them spirit mounds.

42:21.617 --> 42:23.152
They say it's where
fallen angels go

42:23.185 --> 42:25.221
when they're
expelled from heaven.

42:25.254 --> 42:29.692
They say the spirits will drive
you mad and drive you to...

42:31.260 --> 42:33.529
Drive you to do what?

42:36.265 --> 42:37.900
Hurt yourself.

42:39.568 --> 42:40.202
Or worse.

42:44.507 --> 42:45.708
Did you ever touch one?

42:45.741 --> 42:46.575
Heavens, no.

42:48.110 --> 42:49.979
Miss Fontaine forbids
I ever go there,

42:50.012 --> 42:52.048
or even stare too hard
to the other side.

42:53.549 --> 42:55.584
She knows all sorts
about such things.

42:57.219 --> 42:58.020
Does she?

43:54.877 --> 43:58.581
That dress doesn't
look like that on me.

44:09.358 --> 44:12.261
I want to show
you something fun.

44:15.931 --> 44:16.866
Don't be afraid.

44:20.369 --> 44:22.138
Breathe.

44:27.009 --> 44:28.244
Breathe deeper.

44:36.352 --> 44:37.586
Deeper.

44:42.691 --> 44:43.692
Now, faster.

44:47.997 --> 44:53.002
Faster.

44:54.036 --> 44:54.904
Hold your breath.

45:32.708 --> 45:34.677
Told you before, Lara,

45:36.112 --> 45:38.280
not to leave your
trinkets about the house.

45:39.715 --> 45:41.984
And you know how I feel
about that in particular.

45:59.768 --> 46:01.837
Let me see you eat
something, Carmilla.

46:01.871 --> 46:03.038
You must be famished.

46:04.474 --> 46:06.175
Apart from which, Margaret
went to a lot of trouble

46:06.208 --> 46:07.810
to prepare us something hot.

46:15.284 --> 46:16.118
Eat it.

46:51.253 --> 46:54.424
Thine eyes and on
thy forehead gaze.

46:57.527 --> 46:59.795
200 to adore each breast,

47:02.499 --> 47:04.166
but 30,000 to the rest.

47:05.768 --> 47:07.836
An age at least to every part.

47:09.772 --> 47:11.740
An age at least to every part.

47:11.774 --> 47:14.076
And the last age
should show your heart.

47:14.109 --> 47:18.781
And the last age
should show your heart.

47:18.814 --> 47:21.817
An age at least to every part,

47:21.850 --> 47:25.187
and the last age
should show your heart.

48:07.863 --> 48:10.933
The grave's a fine
and private place,

48:12.134 --> 48:14.837
but none, I think,
do there embrace.

48:15.572 --> 48:19.008
Now therefore, while
thy youthful hew

48:19.041 --> 48:21.844
sits on thy skin
like morning dew,

48:21.877 --> 48:23.946
and while thy willing
soul transpires

48:23.979 --> 48:26.583
at every pore with
instant fires,

48:26.616 --> 48:28.551
now let us sport
us while we may,

48:29.619 --> 48:32.321
and now, like amorous
birds of prey,

48:32.354 --> 48:34.591
rather at once our time devour

48:34.624 --> 48:37.259
than languish in his
slow-chapped power.

48:40.563 --> 48:41.797
That's very impressive.

48:44.867 --> 48:46.335
But you have missed a verse.

48:54.910 --> 48:56.479
It's all very
exciting, isn't it?

49:00.983 --> 49:03.886
Come.

49:03.919 --> 49:04.987
Let's go for a walk.

49:11.260 --> 49:16.265
I remember when I was a
young lady, about your age,

49:17.933 --> 49:22.539
there was a person who gave me

49:22.572 --> 49:24.273
a feeling I had
never felt before.

49:27.109 --> 49:31.313
It was a new feeling,
and it confused me.

49:35.084 --> 49:38.987
So to understand it,
I reflected on it,

49:39.021 --> 49:40.322
on what that feeling could be.

49:41.957 --> 49:46.862
But before I understood it,
I made choices based on it.

49:49.432 --> 49:52.635
And those choices affected
the rest of my life.

50:01.009 --> 50:03.580
Looking back, I now know
what that feeling was.

50:06.583 --> 50:09.419
It was excitement, that's all.

50:11.086 --> 50:12.655
But I wish I'd known that then.

50:17.394 --> 50:20.195
Don't confuse your
feelings, Lara.

50:20.229 --> 50:21.964
Don't make the same
mistakes I did.

50:41.751 --> 50:42.918
Don't touch it, Lara.

50:48.056 --> 50:48.957
It's just nature.

50:53.195 --> 50:55.063
Why has
nothing eaten it?

50:56.766 --> 50:59.001
Dead animals are
food for living ones.

51:00.035 --> 51:01.069
You taught me that.

51:02.271 --> 51:03.440
Not actually so.

51:03.473 --> 51:05.675
Living ones are more appealing.

51:05.708 --> 51:07.309
Perhaps it's diseased.

51:07.342 --> 51:08.511
If an animal eats that,

51:08.545 --> 51:10.012
it could die from the
very same sickness

51:10.045 --> 51:11.246
that killed that poor thing.

52:19.816 --> 52:21.316
Don't be scared.

53:51.173 --> 53:51.874
Carmilla?

54:00.950 --> 54:01.784
Carmilla.

54:05.588 --> 54:08.123
Carmilla, are you all right?

54:23.238 --> 54:25.374
I must have fallen out
of bed while dreaming.

54:26.743 --> 54:27.577
I'm fine.

54:33.215 --> 54:34.517
I had quite a dream now too.

54:36.218 --> 54:37.654
In fact, you were in it.

54:52.468 --> 54:53.569
You have perfume on.

54:54.604 --> 54:55.772
Heavens, no.

54:56.973 --> 54:59.509
I sometimes rub the petal of
a rose, though, and pretend.

55:01.010 --> 55:02.344
Do you like the smell?

55:02.378 --> 55:03.379
Yeah, it's pretty.

55:07.450 --> 55:08.751
Tell me about your dream.

55:11.286 --> 55:13.221
The one I was in.

55:23.433 --> 55:27.470
They say it's what one doesn't
say in recounting a dream

55:27.503 --> 55:29.271
that has the most significance.

55:32.575 --> 55:34.944
Do you think that's
the same with poems?

55:34.977 --> 55:36.311
What do you mean?

55:37.814 --> 55:39.347
I left out a
verse when reciting

55:39.382 --> 55:41.384
my poem today to Miss Fontaine.

55:43.386 --> 55:44.487
Do you want to hear it?

55:44.520 --> 55:45.353
Mm-hmm.

55:46.723 --> 55:51.027
For, Lady, you
deserve this state,

55:51.060 --> 55:53.328
nor would I love at lower rate.

55:53.996 --> 55:56.364
But at my back, I always hear

55:56.399 --> 55:59.267
time's winged chariot
hurrying near,

55:59.301 --> 56:01.471
and yonder all before us lie

56:01.504 --> 56:03.940
deserts of vast eternity.

56:11.380 --> 56:13.449
"Deserts of vast eternity."

56:15.418 --> 56:16.986
That's truly beautiful.

56:19.321 --> 56:22.792
There was something
from my dream.

56:29.699 --> 56:31.299
I couldn't breathe.

56:37.907 --> 56:38.808
In real life too.

56:41.477 --> 56:43.780
I woke and I still
couldn't breathe.

56:45.882 --> 56:48.384
Couldn't breathe and
I couldn't call out.

56:50.352 --> 56:51.053
It was terrifying.

56:56.125 --> 57:01.063
It felt as though there was
something around my neck,

57:03.833 --> 57:05.501
as though...

57:17.680 --> 57:21.417
As though death
were around your neck.

57:21.450 --> 57:25.021
Yes, as though death
were around my neck.

57:44.807 --> 57:45.641
You see?

57:47.944 --> 57:50.112
You can breathe perfectly.

57:55.151 --> 57:55.785
Come.

57:58.521 --> 58:00.690
Where are you going?

58:00.723 --> 58:02.058
Come.

58:02.091 --> 58:03.960
Carmilla, no.

58:03.993 --> 58:05.027
Carmilla.

59:33.015 --> 59:34.684
You're so beautiful.

59:38.921 --> 59:39.755
Come with me.

59:52.034 --> 59:53.769
This is where I
get my rose petals.

59:56.772 --> 59:57.606
Hold this.

01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:01.477
Don't do that.

01:00:02.645 --> 01:00:03.279
Why not?

01:00:05.214 --> 01:00:06.582
It doesn't want to come off.

01:00:06.615 --> 01:00:08.150
That's silly.

01:00:08.184 --> 01:00:09.719
Flowers are supposed
to be picked.

01:00:09.752 --> 01:00:10.619
Stop it.

01:00:14.023 --> 01:00:14.857
You see?

01:00:29.038 --> 01:00:30.172
Let's be blood sisters.

01:01:08.044 --> 01:01:09.678
You're beautiful.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.076
Good morning.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:22.379
Good morning.

01:03:39.995 --> 01:03:42.698
Carmilla hasn't come down yet?

01:03:46.503 --> 01:03:48.971
No, she has not.

01:04:19.902 --> 01:04:21.070
Shall I go and wake her?

01:04:21.103 --> 01:04:24.773
Best to let her lie in,
after all she's been through.

01:04:28.277 --> 01:04:29.111
Mm.

01:04:34.517 --> 01:04:35.452
Did you sleep well?

01:04:36.819 --> 01:04:37.454
Yes.

01:04:38.455 --> 01:04:39.955
And yet you look most tired.

01:04:41.957 --> 01:04:42.791
And pale.

01:04:43.892 --> 01:04:45.361
Are you sure you're
feeling well?

01:04:49.131 --> 01:04:51.434
Well, perhaps you just
need a bit of sunshine.

01:04:52.835 --> 01:04:55.137
This morning, if
the weather permits,

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.773
we shall go for a
walk, just you and I.

01:05:14.424 --> 01:05:16.526
Lara, I shall have to bind
that arm of yours again

01:05:16.559 --> 01:05:17.860
if you're not mindful.

01:05:20.095 --> 01:05:21.864
Where is your head these days?

01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:24.567
First, you're fixated on
Charlotte's visit and now...

01:05:31.006 --> 01:05:33.042
You-

01:05:40.417 --> 01:05:41.850
Madam, I bring you the latest

01:05:41.884 --> 01:05:43.486
and greatest
potions and lotions,

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.456
elixirs and fixers,
magic and lotion.

01:05:46.489 --> 01:05:48.591
Not for the faint-hearted, mind.

01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:50.560
But if you are, I
can fix that too.

01:05:50.593 --> 01:05:52.495
Hearts fixed with no tricks.

01:05:59.469 --> 01:06:02.071
And I can take several petals,

01:06:02.104 --> 01:06:04.340
gathered from this very garden,

01:06:04.373 --> 01:06:09.011
so that each delicate fragment
can become whole again.

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:11.980
A single petal,

01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:16.285
a single petal can grow

01:06:19.021 --> 01:06:20.222
and transform anew.

01:07:10.038 --> 01:07:12.141
I heard word from Mr. Bauer,

01:07:12.174 --> 01:07:14.309
and no one has heard
of a missing girl.

01:07:15.645 --> 01:07:16.945
It will just take time.

01:07:16.979 --> 01:07:18.213
Yes.

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:20.115
What about the Duval girl?

01:07:20.149 --> 01:07:21.316
She grows worse.

01:07:22.452 --> 01:07:23.986
More pale by the day.

01:07:28.056 --> 01:07:29.692
There's darkness under her eyes.

01:08:08.197 --> 01:08:09.131
What is this?

01:08:10.332 --> 01:08:12.167
It's from my mother.

01:08:12.201 --> 01:08:13.335
Your mother?

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:17.139
Yes, she passed
when I was young.

01:08:27.783 --> 01:08:29.151
The brooch is nice.

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:53.341
You know we're not true
blood sisters, don't you?

01:08:56.645 --> 01:08:57.479
Yes, I know.

01:08:58.848 --> 01:09:03.685
To be true blood sisters,
both our blood must mix.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.189
You have mine, but I not yours.

01:09:08.825 --> 01:09:10.058
It's your turn.

01:09:20.502 --> 01:09:22.136
I have a dark
secret, you know?

01:09:40.322 --> 01:09:41.356
I'm left-handed.

01:09:44.394 --> 01:09:47.729
That's not a secret,
and certainly not dark.

01:09:48.798 --> 01:09:50.332
It is.

01:09:50.365 --> 01:09:52.301
Miss Fontaine says
it calls the devil.

01:11:47.417 --> 01:11:48.216
Lara.

01:11:49.919 --> 01:11:50.720
Get up.

01:14:10.726 --> 01:14:15.565
Miss Fontaine
told me to bring you some food.

01:14:36.485 --> 01:14:37.720
Lara, please.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:41.724
Lara.

01:15:38.514 --> 01:15:40.182
I received a letter.

01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:52.828
And Charlotte...

01:16:04.006 --> 01:16:05.074
Please, Lara.

01:16:06.075 --> 01:16:07.243
I'm praying for you.

01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:18.054
I'm praying for you.

01:16:46.549 --> 01:16:48.117
And how many would that make?

01:16:49.085 --> 01:16:50.853
This is the third case.

01:16:50.886 --> 01:16:52.788
And now, Lara makes four?

01:16:52.822 --> 01:16:54.256
Lara's symptoms
are still too early

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:55.858
for us to make that conclusion.

01:16:58.728 --> 01:17:02.064
Well, I found this
in her carriage.

01:17:34.597 --> 01:17:37.033
Have you seen any of these
behaviors in the child?

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.271
She sleeps excessively late.

01:17:43.639 --> 01:17:47.710
She removed a cross and
hid it under her bed.

01:17:48.677 --> 01:17:51.647
We all saw how the dog
reacted to the sight

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:52.848
or perhaps even
the smell of her.

01:17:52.882 --> 01:17:54.817
Trust animals to
see what we can't.

01:17:56.318 --> 01:17:57.153
And...

01:18:00.656 --> 01:18:01.857
Miss Fontaine, what is it?

01:18:08.697 --> 01:18:10.933
The other day, I found them

01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:19.241
in Lara's bedroom.

01:18:19.275 --> 01:18:21.744
She had taken Lara's blood.

01:18:24.980 --> 01:18:25.815
I saw it.

01:18:35.257 --> 01:18:37.726
I must
go and alert Mr. Bauer.

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:42.098
Don't leave me here.

01:18:44.733 --> 01:18:45.768
Please.

01:19:42.392 --> 01:19:44.260
With all our efforts to
keep this house safe,

01:19:44.293 --> 01:19:46.228
it does seem that we,
or rather Mr. Bauer,

01:19:46.262 --> 01:19:48.764
has let the devil right
in through the front door.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:52.902
Dr. Renquist will guide us

01:19:52.935 --> 01:19:55.070
in restoring things
back to normal order.

01:19:57.474 --> 01:20:00.142
But we will need your
full cooperation.

01:20:02.111 --> 01:20:03.746
We will need your help.

01:20:04.514 --> 01:20:06.182
- You have mine.
- More than that.

01:20:08.284 --> 01:20:10.319
We will need your confidence.

01:20:10.352 --> 01:20:15.291
This cannot become gossip nor
reach Mr. Bauer before time.

01:20:15.324 --> 01:20:17.793
You have
my word, Miss Fontaine.

01:20:19.895 --> 01:20:21.263
Now, in the
absence of Mr. Bauer,

01:20:21.297 --> 01:20:22.932
we cannot seek his permission.

01:20:25.201 --> 01:20:30.206
But trust this is the
only way to save Lara now.

01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:53.796
No!

01:20:53.829 --> 01:20:56.799
I said don't move!

01:21:00.369 --> 01:21:01.804
Stay still.

01:21:08.378 --> 01:21:10.145
- Harder, harder.
- I said don't move!

01:21:11.414 --> 01:21:12.549
Again.

01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:21.257
What are you doing?!

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:22.791
- Lara!
- Lara, you go back

01:21:22.825 --> 01:21:23.727
to your room!

01:21:23.759 --> 01:21:25.928
- Go back to your room now.
- No, stop it!

01:21:25.961 --> 01:21:27.464
- Stop it!
- Lara!

01:21:27.497 --> 01:21:28.864
Stop!

01:21:29.599 --> 01:21:30.766
Carmilla, run!

01:21:32.935 --> 01:21:34.003
Lara.

01:21:34.036 --> 01:21:35.137
Stop it.

01:21:36.872 --> 01:21:40.909
Stop her! Take her back
to her room, right now!

01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:27.222
Come.

01:22:39.602 --> 01:22:40.437
Come.

01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:09.492
Do you believe in hell?

01:24:11.394 --> 01:24:12.227
No.

01:24:13.996 --> 01:24:15.030
Don't?

01:24:16.098 --> 01:24:16.932
Mm-mm.

01:24:18.735 --> 01:24:19.569
Heaven?

01:24:22.539 --> 01:24:23.372
No.

01:24:24.774 --> 01:24:26.041
After we die?

01:24:32.147 --> 01:24:32.981
No.

01:24:34.784 --> 01:24:36.084
What, then?

01:24:42.792 --> 01:24:44.561
In deserts of eternity.

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.968
- Lara-
- They think you're the devil.

01:24:59.107 --> 01:25:00.710
What do you think?

01:25:04.514 --> 01:25:07.383
Carmilla, I
took something from you.

01:25:10.787 --> 01:25:13.055
I found it where they found you.

01:25:14.524 --> 01:25:16.058
It's not mine.

01:26:19.856 --> 01:26:20.657
No.

01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:22.825
No, no, no.

01:26:22.859 --> 01:26:24.326
No!

01:26:24.359 --> 01:26:26.429
No!

01:26:27.362 --> 01:26:28.196
No!

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:31.434
No!

01:26:34.804 --> 01:26:35.638
No!
