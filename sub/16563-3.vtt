WEBVTT

00:00.736 --> 00:03.251
- Previously on Pitch...
- And there you have it.

00:03.275 --> 00:04.657
For the first time in history,

00:04.743 --> 00:06.659
a woman has taken the mound

00:06.745 --> 00:08.244
in a Major League Baseball game.

00:08.280 --> 00:10.280
Enjoy your moment in the sun.

00:10.332 --> 00:12.031
'Cause there's 29 pro teams as we speak

00:12.117 --> 00:14.450
figuring out that
little trick pitch of yours,

00:14.502 --> 00:16.405
and when they do, I'll get my job back

00:16.406 --> 00:19.000
and you'll become the
answer to a trivia question.

00:19.002 --> 00:21.504
According to many
sources, Ginny is a distraction.

00:21.505 --> 00:22.603
Well, if I can keep my trap shut,

00:22.627 --> 00:24.043
there'll be no distraction.

00:24.129 --> 00:25.762
Geez! Guys, can we just go back

00:25.797 --> 00:27.241
to talking about how pretty the girl is?

00:27.265 --> 00:28.348
Al is done.

00:28.433 --> 00:29.766
Choose an interim manager.

00:29.801 --> 00:30.945
I want it done by week's end.

00:30.969 --> 00:32.217
They're going to fire you.

00:32.218 --> 00:33.781
I really ought
to take the players' bus.

00:33.805 --> 00:35.533
I got to be one of the
guys right now, Amelia.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.683
Ginny, look in the mirror.

00:36.684 --> 00:38.286
You are never gonna be one of the guys.

00:38.310 --> 00:39.871
Is Ginny getting
us more attention, huh?

00:39.895 --> 00:42.145
Yeah, yeah, she is, man.

00:42.230 --> 00:43.905
Which sucks, 'cause we're losing

00:43.906 --> 00:45.231
in front of sold-out crowds.

00:45.317 --> 00:47.951
How about we start winning
in front of sold-out crowds?

00:47.986 --> 00:49.626
Maybe we all start
working as hard as her.

00:49.654 --> 00:51.704
Maybe we start acting like a team

00:51.790 --> 00:53.489
instead of a bunch of spoiled brats.

00:53.575 --> 00:56.326
Then maybe I'll feel lucky that
you guys are all I have.

01:01.549 --> 01:03.132
Now, this is big, Mark.

01:05.837 --> 01:08.721
The question is whether Buck
Garland is going to use

01:08.807 --> 01:11.341
a pinch hitter, given what
just happened last inning.

01:11.426 --> 01:13.003
Yeah,
tough position for a guy

01:13.005 --> 01:14.260
managing his first game, Dick.

01:14.346 --> 01:17.230
He's got the lefty,
Stubbs, on the bench...

01:17.315 --> 01:18.598
but he's gonna let her hit.

01:24.522 --> 01:25.855
Come on, Gin.

01:25.907 --> 01:28.024
Oh, my, so Buck is going

01:28.076 --> 01:30.910
to let Ginny Baker face the
big right-hander Greg Mount.

01:30.996 --> 01:33.947
And you can feel the
blood pressure spiking

01:34.032 --> 01:35.415
here at Petco.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.041
It's a big enough challenge

01:37.042 --> 01:38.596
for the first woman in
Major League Baseball

01:38.620 --> 01:40.420
to compete against men in the sport,

01:40.505 --> 01:43.039
but now things could get really ugly.

01:43.124 --> 01:45.124
I'll bet Ginny
didn't wake up this morning

01:45.210 --> 01:47.126
thinking she'd be right in the middle

01:47.212 --> 01:48.378
of a beanball war.

01:48.430 --> 01:51.047
- Be ready.
- Right behind you.

01:56.054 --> 01:58.554
Mountain into his windup.

02:02.394 --> 02:04.560
Look out!

02:20.378 --> 02:22.078
Mmm...

02:29.671 --> 02:31.054
- Ginny called.
- Baker.

02:37.929 --> 02:39.595
Whoo!

02:46.412 --> 02:48.654
Sorry, I don't have time to eat.

02:48.740 --> 02:49.772
This is for me.

02:49.824 --> 02:51.407
Oh.

02:51.443 --> 02:53.276
I-I could whip something up for you.

02:53.361 --> 02:54.994
I can't. I'm slammed today.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.947
I've got corporate sponsors
coming to see Ginny pitch.

02:58.033 --> 03:01.617
Hey, um, just confirming, we can't...

03:01.669 --> 03:03.786
Relax, I'm not gonna say anything.

03:03.872 --> 03:05.338
Although I don't know why.

03:05.423 --> 03:06.850
We're both single and consenting.

03:07.012 --> 03:08.791
Ginny's a big girl.

03:08.843 --> 03:10.710
She still carries your rookie card

03:10.795 --> 03:12.462
and had your poster on her wall.

03:12.547 --> 03:13.463
Really?

03:14.682 --> 03:15.965
She had me on her wall?

03:16.051 --> 03:16.851
I'll see you around.

03:16.885 --> 03:18.885
Yeah, you will.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:27.695 --> 03:29.612
Morning, Buck.

03:29.647 --> 03:30.730
Hey, good morning, boss.

03:30.815 --> 03:32.315
I understand you spoke to Oscar.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.733
Yup.

03:33.818 --> 03:35.568
So how you feeling about all this?

03:35.653 --> 03:37.320
I'm good.

03:41.459 --> 03:43.339
You're a guy who lets his
actions speak for him,

03:43.378 --> 03:44.994
aren't you, Buck?

03:51.669 --> 03:52.668
Yep.

03:52.754 --> 03:53.753
Whoo!

03:56.057 --> 03:57.140
Yeah, touch 'em all.

03:57.175 --> 03:59.308
Damn it! You know what?

03:59.344 --> 04:00.321
If you could hit like that in real life,

04:00.345 --> 04:01.427
you'd be an all-star.

04:01.513 --> 04:04.013
Baker. Hey...

04:04.099 --> 04:06.899
For you, from Drake.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.483
You're also invited to a party

04:10.484 --> 04:11.687
in New York for his new album.

04:11.773 --> 04:14.524
He says he'll send a jet.

04:14.576 --> 04:17.110
You guys opened the card?

04:17.195 --> 04:18.694
- Yeah.
- Of course.

04:18.745 --> 04:20.696
She'll go out with
rappers but not ballplayers.

04:20.748 --> 04:22.615
First of all, I'm not
going out with Drake.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.200
I don't even know Drake.

04:24.252 --> 04:26.202
But I've met you guys, and I don't care

04:26.287 --> 04:28.263
if you're rappers or doctors,

04:28.264 --> 04:29.650
I'm never gonna go out with you.

04:33.795 --> 04:34.961
Woo-jin.

04:35.046 --> 04:36.712
- Huh?
- ‭You don't speak English.

04:36.764 --> 04:38.598
You don't even know what she said.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.200
Hey, did you hear I might
be getting off the DL today?

04:46.224 --> 04:47.890
Same day we're playing against the guy

04:47.942 --> 04:50.037
- who put you there.
- You know what that means, right?

04:50.061 --> 04:51.360
Me coming off the disabled list?

04:51.396 --> 04:52.895
One of us has to go back down.

04:52.981 --> 04:55.064
One of us has to go back down.

04:57.569 --> 05:00.229
We'll
nibble outside with Mercer.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.049
Nothing but screwgies and rainbows.

05:02.073 --> 05:03.934
He'll foul off a
couple, and then we'll bust him

05:03.958 --> 05:05.436
on the hands with that thing
you call a fastball.

05:05.460 --> 05:06.659
Got it?

05:06.744 --> 05:07.994
Yeah.

05:08.079 --> 05:10.246
- Can we talk about Theo Falcone?
- No.

05:10.298 --> 05:11.525
Last time you guys played the Cardinals,

05:11.549 --> 05:12.560
he hit Tommy and broke his hand.

05:12.584 --> 05:14.717
- So?
- So there's a code.

05:14.752 --> 05:16.302
This isn't a game for payback.

05:16.387 --> 05:18.387
I can do this. I want to do this.

05:18.423 --> 05:21.090
A whiffle ball would hurt
more than any pitch you throw.

05:21.176 --> 05:24.060
So you're saying this fight needs
to be settled between men.

05:25.597 --> 05:27.730
You're exhausting. I'll
see you out there.

05:28.933 --> 05:30.433
Nap time.

05:30.518 --> 05:31.901
You sleep a lot, old man.

05:31.936 --> 05:32.902
Out of my yard, rookie.

05:37.759 --> 05:41.508
_

05:48.670 --> 05:50.086
From the man in the green shirt.

05:53.541 --> 05:54.874
Is that...

05:54.959 --> 05:56.959
Yeah, the Travelers' catcher,
Trevor something.

05:57.011 --> 05:58.961
Well, why is he
sending a drink to Ginny?

05:59.013 --> 06:00.463
What's wrong with this?

06:00.515 --> 06:03.466
'Cause you look happy,
content, and satisfied.

06:03.518 --> 06:05.768
And he doesn't want to mess with this.

06:07.138 --> 06:08.804
You should invite him over.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.117
You know my code. I don't date...

06:10.141 --> 06:12.009
Oh, no, here he comes.

06:16.792 --> 06:18.484
Yeah, she doesn't date ballplayers.

06:18.615 --> 06:20.427
Well, she struck me
out three times tonight,

06:20.451 --> 06:21.817
so, clearly, I'm no ballplayer.

06:21.869 --> 06:24.320
Are you trying to strike
out a fourth time?

06:24.372 --> 06:28.824
It's just a beer, not a date.

06:30.378 --> 06:31.827
Then I'll say thank you.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.963
Called strike three.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.833
You're welcome.

06:42.507 --> 06:46.225
Man, y'all are brutal.

06:46.311 --> 06:47.582
He is fine, though.

06:53.318 --> 06:55.351
Says no pain.

06:55.403 --> 06:58.821
Velocity's good. Curve has a bite.

06:58.856 --> 07:00.690
Yep.

07:00.775 --> 07:02.358
The boss is here today.

07:02.410 --> 07:04.577
- Okay.
- And Max.

07:04.662 --> 07:06.329
How do you know?

07:06.364 --> 07:08.192
Saw her car.

07:09.584 --> 07:10.950
Ownership's gathering.

07:11.035 --> 07:12.535
I could get the ax today.

07:14.422 --> 07:16.706
Look, Al, you're my friend.

07:16.758 --> 07:19.759
And I don't steal another man's woman

07:19.844 --> 07:21.377
or his job.

07:21.462 --> 07:22.878
But there's not a lot of teams

07:22.964 --> 07:25.047
that are looking
for a 67-year-old coach.

07:25.099 --> 07:27.466
And if you're gonna go anyways,

07:27.552 --> 07:30.519
I wouldn't mind
having my day in the sun.

07:30.555 --> 07:32.555
If not for anything, just to tan.

07:32.640 --> 07:35.427
Buck, I want you to
know that if I get canned,

07:35.575 --> 07:38.133
nothing would make me
happier than you getting the job.

07:38.134 --> 07:39.729
But this is my ball club

07:39.781 --> 07:41.113
and I'm not ready to give it up.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.825
They're gonna have to take it from me.

07:42.826 --> 07:44.900
And I don't plan to let them.

07:44.986 --> 07:48.454
Look at you, you don't tan anyway.

07:52.377 --> 07:53.909
Tommy's ready to come off the DL.

07:53.995 --> 07:55.578
Yeah, all right.

07:55.663 --> 07:58.247
- I'm thinking Woo-jin should go down.
- ‭Agree.

07:58.299 --> 08:00.249
I'll find his
translator and let him know.

08:00.301 --> 08:03.169
Oscar, telling a player he's
being sent down is my job.

08:03.254 --> 08:05.588
I like to look a man in the eye,

08:05.640 --> 08:07.785
- good news or bad.
- No, I'll handle this one.

08:07.809 --> 08:09.392
You got a lot on your plate today, Al.

08:09.427 --> 08:11.205
Speaking of which, we're
not gonna have a problem

08:11.206 --> 08:12.122
with the Cardinals, are we?

08:12.146 --> 08:14.063
Since Falcone threw at Tommy last time?

08:14.098 --> 08:16.015
Not with Ginny pitching.

08:16.100 --> 08:18.984
Right.

08:19.070 --> 08:21.358
Okay, I'll handle Woo-jin.

08:24.575 --> 08:26.108
Yeah...

08:26.160 --> 08:27.743
I'm getting fired today.

08:29.914 --> 08:32.030
Frank wants to
keep 4:30 open for Al,

08:32.116 --> 08:34.450
so I bumped the conference
call with the Midwest scouts

08:34.534 --> 08:36.085
- to tomorrow.
- That's good.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.671
Oscar, I'm sorry, I know
Al got you your start here.

08:38.756 --> 08:40.840
Ah, find Woo-jin's translator for me.

08:40.924 --> 08:42.758
Pak is out with the
flu, Al didn't want him

08:42.794 --> 08:44.592
- near the clubhouse.
- Okay, well, get him on the phone.

08:44.593 --> 08:45.961
Poor Woo-jin.

08:46.013 --> 08:49.048
Yes, poor Woo-jin, poor
Al, poor me, poor everyone.

08:49.133 --> 08:50.716
What's that Clooney movie, on the boat,

08:50.802 --> 08:53.302
where everything goes wrong?

08:53.388 --> 08:54.770
Ocean's Eleven?

08:54.806 --> 08:57.139
No, what? Why would you think that?

08:57.225 --> 08:58.941
Oh, look who's here.

08:58.976 --> 09:00.254
- What a surprise.
- ‭You didn't forget

09:00.278 --> 09:01.538
to have "the talk" with her, did you?

09:01.562 --> 09:03.312
Of course not. Hi.

09:03.364 --> 09:05.314
Ginny's pitching today.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.760
It's Daniella's first time
watching her pitch.

09:06.784 --> 09:08.045
- Hello, Daniella.
- ‭Hey, Rhonda.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.819
Where are we sitting?

09:09.904 --> 09:11.654
The Perfect Storm.

09:13.491 --> 09:15.741
All I know is it makes
me want to go to prison.

09:15.827 --> 09:17.971
- They're my kind of inmates.
- I'm pretty sure

09:17.995 --> 09:19.912
they'd put you in a prison
with men, Lonnie.

09:19.997 --> 09:22.164
Al, you watch Orange Is the New Black?

09:22.216 --> 09:23.394
Nah, I'm more a History Channel guy.

09:23.418 --> 09:24.667
Here's my lineup.

09:24.719 --> 09:27.553
Look, Craw. protect my
hitters today, huh?

09:27.638 --> 09:30.139
Falcone, he's crazy,
he'd throw at Malala.

09:30.174 --> 09:31.778
Hey, my guy needs to pitch inside.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.008
Cut him some slack.

09:33.060 --> 09:35.227
Let me know if I wrote too small.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.480
What's that supposed to mean?

09:37.515 --> 09:39.682
What do you mean "What's
that supposed to mean?"

09:39.767 --> 09:41.847
That you wrote it too
small, you taking a shot at me

09:41.848 --> 09:44.987
- about the last time?
- No, I'm asking if I wrote the names

09:45.022 --> 09:47.239
too small because I know you
don't have your glasses on.

09:47.325 --> 09:49.575
Now, I can read 'em to
you if you can't see.

09:49.660 --> 09:50.860
You want a problem, Al?

09:50.912 --> 09:52.411
Otherwise, forget about it.

09:52.497 --> 09:53.891
This guy, the last
time he worked the plate,

09:53.915 --> 09:56.115
the strike zone was the size
of a cocktail napkin,

09:56.200 --> 09:58.367
before that, it was as
wide as my fat ass.

09:58.419 --> 10:00.180
- Al, I am warning you.
- Oh, you're warning me?

10:00.204 --> 10:02.288
Well, let me get in the
sunlight so you can see me

10:02.373 --> 10:04.373
- to warn me!
- I've had it with your fat mouth!

10:04.459 --> 10:06.459
- You get out of here! You're out!
- ‭Good!

10:06.544 --> 10:09.022
- That's the last thing I need, is
to be out here with you. - Get out!

10:09.046 --> 10:10.407
Skip just got tossed.

10:10.431 --> 10:11.881
Before the national anthem?

10:13.551 --> 10:15.851
What the hell just happened?

10:15.887 --> 10:18.053
That was my last Major League
game and your first.

10:18.139 --> 10:21.190
That's what just happened.

10:21.225 --> 10:23.058
Go get 'em, guys.

10:37.613 --> 10:39.496
_

10:44.523 --> 10:46.991
What?

10:47.026 --> 10:48.546
- I think you did.
- I think I did not.

10:48.577 --> 10:50.077
Once you ordered food, this went from

10:50.162 --> 10:52.830
meeting for a drink to
now going on a date.

10:52.865 --> 10:53.976
I plan on paying for my own food.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.416
Okay, 'cause you're a ballplayer

10:55.501 --> 10:57.012
and you gotta live by your code, right?

10:57.036 --> 10:59.536
Yes. I'm a ballplayer
who plays with men.

10:59.588 --> 11:02.006
Men who still look at
me and see boobs and an ass

11:02.041 --> 11:04.258
and everything that goes with it.

11:04.343 --> 11:06.043
You have no idea what I deal with.

11:06.128 --> 11:07.845
Half the guys around me are misogynists

11:07.880 --> 11:09.274
who don't think a woman deserves a shot,

11:09.298 --> 11:12.016
and the other half are worse.

11:12.051 --> 11:13.017
Worse? How's that?

11:13.052 --> 11:14.385
Because they're good guys

11:14.470 --> 11:16.720
who just want to protect Orphan Annie.

11:16.772 --> 11:19.189
And I just want them to
see me as a regular ballplayer.

11:19.225 --> 11:23.310
What if I told you that I was, um...

11:23.396 --> 11:24.862
I was quitting the game?

11:24.897 --> 11:27.064
You'd quit the game to date me?

11:27.116 --> 11:28.710
No, I'm not quitting
the game to date you,

11:28.734 --> 11:30.379
I'm quitting the game because
I can't hit you.

11:30.403 --> 11:32.787
I mean, I can't run fast, hit for power,

11:32.788 --> 11:33.765
hit for anything, really.

11:33.789 --> 11:36.573
But I'm smart. Could've
got into Cal Poly

11:36.625 --> 11:38.409
on a full academic scholarship.

11:38.494 --> 11:40.362
And I'm going.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.107
So I don't really want to
spend the rest of my life

11:42.131 --> 11:43.297
playing in the minors.

11:43.382 --> 11:45.249
You're just trying to get laid.

11:45.301 --> 11:47.145
No, I'm trying to get into
college and get a degree.

11:47.169 --> 11:48.752
In business, maybe.

11:48.804 --> 11:51.755
You switch-hit, you
have a cannon for an arm.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.340
I hear you're great with pitchers.

11:53.426 --> 11:55.509
Maybe you just need to work harder.

11:55.594 --> 11:56.760
Nut up.

11:56.812 --> 11:58.512
Nut up?

11:58.597 --> 11:59.813
Maybe.

11:59.899 --> 12:01.482
I've worked on the other stuff, Ginny.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.233
You're born with it or you're not.

12:03.269 --> 12:05.402
And you were born with all of it.

12:11.026 --> 12:12.352
So how long?

12:12.538 --> 12:13.889
I mean, we ain't
gonna make the playoffs,

12:13.913 --> 12:15.606
so I would say, like, a month.

12:15.950 --> 12:18.260
Can I get
you guys anything else?

12:18.284 --> 12:20.167
Just the check, please.

12:20.252 --> 12:21.368
Okay.

12:22.755 --> 12:24.671
I will just leave this here.

12:24.757 --> 12:26.707
Whenever you're ready.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.926
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:45.611 --> 12:47.528
No one can know. You swear?

12:47.613 --> 12:48.529
Yeah, I swear.

12:48.614 --> 12:49.530
Especially players.

12:49.615 --> 12:51.315
Okay, I swear.

13:03.662 --> 13:04.821
Let's go, Gin.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.548
And Ginny
Baker's 2-2 pitch to Ruiz.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.299
Swung on and missed.

13:09.335 --> 13:12.669
She struck him out. One away.

13:12.721 --> 13:14.471
Well, if you're just joining us, fans,

13:14.507 --> 13:17.704
before the game, Padres
skipper Al Luongo

13:17.805 --> 13:20.944
was thrown out during the
exchange of lineup cards.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.246
Lou.

13:22.281 --> 13:23.914
Hector put out a nice spread, Al.

13:23.949 --> 13:25.616
- Get you a meatball sandwich?
- ‭Nah.

13:25.701 --> 13:26.621
No, I'm gonna order in.

13:26.702 --> 13:27.918
I need a table for two

13:27.953 --> 13:28.952
set up right here,

13:29.004 --> 13:30.087
and a menu from Albert's.

13:30.122 --> 13:32.738
- You got it, Al.
- Thanks, Murph.

13:32.860 --> 13:34.936
Hey, guys. My
oldest daughter, Daniella.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.326
Do you mind if she sits with you?

13:36.362 --> 13:37.506
The answer should be, "We'd love it,"

13:37.530 --> 13:38.840
since I gave you the suite today.

13:38.864 --> 13:41.365
Corporate sponsor.
They're interested in Ginny,

13:41.450 --> 13:43.250
- so she has to play well today.
- Oh, okay.

13:43.335 --> 13:44.813
Here, sit right here. You'll
get a better view.

13:44.837 --> 13:46.670
- Was that Elsa?
- No. Shh.

13:46.705 --> 13:48.183
Okay, listen, I've gotta do my thing.

13:48.207 --> 13:49.873
Just text me if you need anything, okay?

13:49.925 --> 13:52.459
She's in great hands. Don't worry.

13:52.545 --> 13:54.545
Oh, yeah! Nice pitch, Ginny!

13:54.597 --> 13:57.047
Sit down, meat, a
girl just punched you out!

13:57.132 --> 13:58.715
It's gonna be fine.

13:58.767 --> 13:59.850
Can't reach a translator?

13:59.885 --> 14:01.134
Well, what if Al or the media

14:01.220 --> 14:02.269
wants to talk to Woo-jin?

14:02.354 --> 14:03.415
Well, he's hitting a buck-80

14:03.439 --> 14:05.029
and can't seem to catch a fly ball,

14:05.030 --> 14:07.035
so, actually, no one
really wants to talk to Woo-jin,

14:07.059 --> 14:09.139
except maybe his mother, and
she speaks his language.

14:09.195 --> 14:11.195
Okay call UCSD, the
linguistics department.

14:11.230 --> 14:12.563
Find someone, please.

14:12.615 --> 14:13.875
Have you talked to Daniella yet?

14:13.899 --> 14:15.449
I will. I will.

14:39.592 --> 14:43.010
Sanders, hitting
285, 14 home runs.

14:43.095 --> 14:44.511
He has a chance to make

14:44.597 --> 14:46.096
his second All-Star Game.

14:46.148 --> 14:47.397
Get it started, Blip!

14:50.069 --> 14:51.130
- Whoa...
- Oh!

14:51.131 --> 14:52.914
And both benches are barking

14:52.938 --> 14:54.271
at each other... that almost hit

14:54.323 --> 14:55.439
Sanders.

14:55.524 --> 14:57.274
What the hell?! That was on purpose!

14:57.359 --> 15:00.077
Now, remember, Theo
Falcone hit Tommy Miller.

15:00.112 --> 15:02.579
He broke his finger,
remember, back in April.

15:02.615 --> 15:05.249
It's gotta be really killing
the skipper, Al Luongo,

15:05.284 --> 15:06.617
not being in the dugout for this.

15:06.702 --> 15:08.285
Well done.

15:08.370 --> 15:10.587
But no open champagne
in this clubhouse, Lou,

15:10.623 --> 15:12.017
unless we're pouring it over heads.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.206
Bad luck.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.126
Sauvignon coming up!

15:16.178 --> 15:17.878
Thanks, Murph.

15:17.963 --> 15:19.680
And the Padres are letting

15:19.765 --> 15:22.132
Falcone hear all about it.

15:22.184 --> 15:23.684
Talk, talk, talk. I guess we're just

15:23.769 --> 15:25.413
gonna let him knock us
down like milk bottles.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.972
I got this.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.641
Don't even think about it.

15:42.118 --> 15:43.765
You worried they might throw at me

15:43.789 --> 15:45.038
if I try to hit one of them?

15:45.124 --> 15:47.324
Worried they might hurt the girl?

15:47.409 --> 15:49.826
- No.
- You're no different.

15:49.878 --> 15:51.545
- Excuse me?
- You're trying to protect me.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.358
You're no different than
those who think I don't belong here.

15:53.382 --> 15:56.049
There's other ways.

15:56.135 --> 15:57.195
Come on, Mikey, come on.

15:57.219 --> 15:59.052
Ball four.

15:59.138 --> 16:00.837
That puts runners on first and second

16:00.889 --> 16:02.472
for Mike Lawson.

16:11.850 --> 16:13.600
High and deep, left field.

16:13.686 --> 16:15.736
Lewis to the wall, it's gone!

16:15.821 --> 16:19.656
Touch 'em all! Oh... my!

16:23.078 --> 16:24.745
What happened?

16:24.830 --> 16:26.233
Mike Lawson just homered.

16:26.383 --> 16:28.081
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

16:28.167 --> 16:29.366
Yeah! Whoo!

16:31.420 --> 16:34.454
Good for him. That's nice.

16:34.540 --> 16:38.208
Home run number 16 for Lawson.

16:46.952 --> 16:48.318
Well, well, well.

16:48.404 --> 16:51.488
Ah, so glad you could make it, Maxine.

16:51.573 --> 16:54.491
I thought you lived on
pastrami and Pork Rinds.

16:54.576 --> 16:56.793
Well, I wasn't in the mood for healthy.

16:56.829 --> 16:58.729
Please sit down.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.520
You got thrown out before the game?

17:03.521 --> 17:05.046
Should do it more often. We're up 4-1.

17:05.069 --> 17:07.788
Uh... yeah, sure.

17:07.873 --> 17:09.800
Baker comes out for
the fifth inning, now,

17:09.825 --> 17:13.242
with a 4-1 lead, thanks
to that Lawson home run.

17:13.328 --> 17:15.996
And she'll face the
pitcher, Theo Falcone,

17:16.080 --> 17:17.547
to lead off the fifth inning.

17:17.583 --> 17:20.438
This should be interesting.

17:31.764 --> 17:34.097
And she hits Falcone!

17:37.236 --> 17:40.237
That's a warning. That's a warning.

17:40.272 --> 17:42.072
That's a warning.

17:42.107 --> 17:44.299
And home plate
umpire Ken Crawford

17:44.423 --> 17:45.609
is warning both teams.

17:45.694 --> 17:48.445
The next pitcher to
throw at someone gets tossed.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.614
You're next, girlfriend!

17:50.699 --> 17:51.782
I'm sorry?

17:51.867 --> 17:53.366
- Time.
- ‭Time out.

17:56.672 --> 17:58.789
You asked for a
fastball, I threw a fastball.

17:58.874 --> 18:00.757
The way it works is,
you hit their pitcher...

18:00.793 --> 18:02.292
They get to hit me. I know the code.

18:02.377 --> 18:03.738
And here's a young woman...

18:03.762 --> 18:05.629
A young woman in just her third start.

18:05.714 --> 18:07.964
The first woman in
Major League Baseball.

18:08.050 --> 18:10.600
And if she thought she
had a target on her before,

18:10.636 --> 18:12.838
wait till her next at bat.

18:15.203 --> 18:17.203
So we go to the
bottom to the fifth inning.

18:17.204 --> 18:19.153
Padres leading 4-1.

18:33.299 --> 18:35.716
What are you doing?

18:44.510 --> 18:46.060
It was an accident.

18:46.145 --> 18:48.312
It wasn't an accident.

18:48.348 --> 18:49.847
She threw at the guy

18:49.932 --> 18:51.327
who threw at Blip and Tommy Miller.

18:51.351 --> 18:53.191
If she hit the other
pitcher, she's daring him.

18:53.269 --> 18:55.686
- To do what?
- Hit her back.

18:55.772 --> 18:57.521
Hit her back?

18:57.573 --> 18:59.990
- Hey, how's it going?
- Oscar!

19:00.026 --> 19:01.910
She wants to pay
Ginny millions of dollars

19:01.939 --> 19:03.005
to put her face in her ads,

19:03.029 --> 19:05.090
so long as a speeding
baseball doesn't break it first.

19:05.114 --> 19:07.092
Well, I think it's too
late for her to change sports.

19:07.116 --> 19:09.033
I'm stopping this.

19:09.118 --> 19:11.035
Eliot...

19:11.120 --> 19:12.514
You're gonna need a bigger press room

19:12.538 --> 19:14.183
because Ginny hitting
someone is blowing up.

19:14.207 --> 19:15.447
Yeah, already getting it ready.

19:15.508 --> 19:17.007
Listen, this is a little awkward,

19:17.043 --> 19:18.342
but I'm beyond desperate.

19:18.378 --> 19:19.877
Are you, by chance, Korean?

19:19.962 --> 19:21.178
Second generation.

19:21.214 --> 19:22.880
- Do you speak Korean?
- ‭A little.

19:22.932 --> 19:24.382
How much "a little"?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.517
Hello and good-bye. Hello
is anyong-haseyo,

19:26.552 --> 19:28.886
and good-bye is anyeong-gaseyo.

19:28.971 --> 19:30.554
Okay. ‭And "eggplant," which is...

19:30.606 --> 19:33.391
No, I do not need eggplant. Is that it?

19:33.443 --> 19:34.976
Yeah.

19:36.362 --> 19:37.760
I'll be back.

19:38.564 --> 19:39.897
Okay.

19:39.982 --> 19:41.282
Anyeong-gaseyo.

19:41.367 --> 19:43.317
How's the foundation doing?

19:43.403 --> 19:44.485
Very well, thank you.

19:44.570 --> 19:46.537
And thank you for donating

19:46.572 --> 19:48.289
so much of your time.

19:48.374 --> 19:49.957
Well, I lost Anna to breast cancer,

19:50.042 --> 19:52.243
so it wasn't a hard thing to get behind.

19:52.295 --> 19:54.078
Yeah, I know.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.964
No, I'm... I'm good.

19:58.634 --> 20:02.169
Al, I know why you called me down here,

20:02.255 --> 20:04.505
but I can't save your job, I'm sorry.

20:04.590 --> 20:08.426
I am very fond of you. You were my hire.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.928
But Frank Reid runs this
team, even though...

20:11.013 --> 20:12.596
Even though he's a minority owner,

20:12.648 --> 20:14.432
he has been designated by the board

20:14.517 --> 20:15.983
to make all the decisions

20:16.068 --> 20:17.902
with regards to baseball.

20:17.937 --> 20:20.187
And he can do so without your approval

20:20.273 --> 20:22.440
or Stan's or Mr. Richardson's.

20:22.492 --> 20:23.908
I know, I know.

20:23.943 --> 20:25.109
I've been here for 11 years.

20:25.161 --> 20:26.422
Yeah, and you're doing a good job.

20:26.446 --> 20:27.445
It's just not my call.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.497
This isn't about me.

20:29.582 --> 20:32.249
This is about your investment.

20:32.285 --> 20:33.918
How's that?

20:33.953 --> 20:35.169
Just the 15 minutes.

20:35.254 --> 20:36.482
That's all I need. We'll send a car.

20:36.506 --> 20:37.483
We'll make it very, very easy.

20:37.507 --> 20:39.290
- Oscar.
- Hold on one second.

20:39.375 --> 20:40.541
Sorry, the Korean Consulate.

20:40.626 --> 20:41.921
I need an interpreter.

20:42.079 --> 20:44.106
You're aware our manager
got thrown out of the game

20:44.130 --> 20:46.514
and our pitcher just
escalated a beanball war?

20:46.599 --> 20:49.300
- Yes, I am. ‭- Oh, it's a shame
it had to end like this for Al.

20:49.352 --> 20:51.635
Does it, Frank?

20:51.687 --> 20:53.471
I'm not doing this dance again.

20:53.523 --> 20:54.855
It's been decided.

20:54.941 --> 20:56.307
Is that official?

20:56.359 --> 20:57.720
Well, not yet.

20:57.721 --> 20:59.621
But it will be when I
find Maxine Armstrong.

20:59.645 --> 21:00.861
Have you seen her?

21:00.947 --> 21:03.113
No.

21:04.367 --> 21:06.283
Have you tried the Luxury Club?

21:06.319 --> 21:08.202
- Ooh.
- Yes.

21:08.287 --> 21:09.870
Hi, y... h-hello?

21:09.956 --> 21:11.372
Anyeong-gaseyo?

21:11.457 --> 21:13.157
Baker's been on our roster

21:13.209 --> 21:14.992
for three weeks. Now,
in those three weeks,

21:15.077 --> 21:16.544
the second biggest story,

21:16.629 --> 21:19.663
after her playing in a baseball game,

21:19.749 --> 21:23.133
is my offending her
by sticking my size 13s

21:23.169 --> 21:25.169
in my big mouth. Now,

21:25.221 --> 21:27.004
you know how it's gonna look

21:27.056 --> 21:29.006
- if Frank Reid fires me?
- No,

21:29.058 --> 21:30.674
but I bet you're gonna tell me.

21:30.726 --> 21:33.177
It's going to look like
the girl had me fired.

21:33.262 --> 21:35.513
It's going to look
like that to the players.

21:35.598 --> 21:38.516
It's going to look like that to
the fans, and the talk radio

21:38.568 --> 21:39.751
and the Twitter people.

21:39.752 --> 21:41.163
They're all going to go crazy

21:41.187 --> 21:43.020
talking about how

21:43.072 --> 21:45.689
spoiled this girl is.

21:45.741 --> 21:48.742
That she came in and
ruined everything just because

21:48.828 --> 21:52.029
her old fart manager
said something stupid,

21:52.081 --> 21:55.332
which would be
untrue and unfair to Baker

21:55.368 --> 21:56.367
because she didn't.

21:56.452 --> 21:58.669
She's a good kid.

21:58.704 --> 22:03.707
She's contributed to this
team and-and I happen to like her,

22:03.759 --> 22:06.343
but it doesn't matter because
the haters, they're just gonna

22:06.379 --> 22:07.962
call her "coach killer,"

22:08.047 --> 22:09.658
in addition to everything
else they call her.

22:09.682 --> 22:11.527
All right, it would be a
distraction, perhaps, for...

22:11.551 --> 22:12.967
A distraction?

22:14.520 --> 22:17.137
This season, forget it, would be over.

22:17.223 --> 22:19.306
That's a shame because

22:19.392 --> 22:21.559
I still think we got a shot.

22:21.644 --> 22:26.063
Now, if you're smart... and you are...

22:26.115 --> 22:28.732
I mean, your big tech
company has made so much money

22:28.818 --> 22:30.618
it can afford to buy this team...

22:30.703 --> 22:32.620
Then you'll let me finish the season

22:32.705 --> 22:35.573
and... I'll retire.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.575
Then you can replace me

22:37.660 --> 22:39.960
if you still want me gone.

22:40.046 --> 22:42.379
And I suggest Buck Garland.

22:42.415 --> 22:44.582
Smart man.

22:44.634 --> 22:46.383
Hmm.

22:46.419 --> 22:49.136
And you're no dummy
yourself, are you, Al?

22:49.221 --> 22:51.088
I have my moments.

22:51.173 --> 22:53.257
I mean, even a hog finds a pile of crap

22:53.342 --> 22:54.975
to roll around in once in a while.

22:55.061 --> 22:57.094
Charming.

23:05.012 --> 23:07.095
Look. I'm going to
have Ellis bat for you.

23:07.147 --> 23:08.397
It's the fifth inning, Buck.

23:08.432 --> 23:09.576
I have two more innings at least.

23:09.600 --> 23:10.682
I feel fine.

23:12.269 --> 23:13.321
Get her out.

23:13.322 --> 23:14.605
Quit treating me like a little girl.

23:14.606 --> 23:15.999
This isn't my first beanball game.

23:16.023 --> 23:17.489
Let her throw another inning.

23:17.575 --> 23:18.774
She earned it.

23:21.195 --> 23:22.578
All right.

23:22.613 --> 23:23.946
One more inning.

23:26.917 --> 23:29.535
This is your first beanball
feud, isn't it?

23:29.620 --> 23:31.370
Totally.

23:31.455 --> 23:33.505
And it looks
like the Cardinals' manager

23:33.591 --> 23:35.924
is going to make a double switch here.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.709
Oh, boy. Look who's coming in.

23:37.795 --> 23:40.212
The big one. The Mountain.

23:40.297 --> 23:43.131
This AT&T Call to the Bullpen

23:43.217 --> 23:45.300
is for the fireballer Greg Mount

23:45.386 --> 23:48.387
to come in for starter Theo Falcone.

23:50.558 --> 23:51.773
Greg Mount will face Baker,

23:51.809 --> 23:54.393
and then the top of the order,
here in the fifth inning.

23:54.478 --> 23:56.061
The big right-hander started

23:56.146 --> 23:57.479
as the team's closer,

23:57.531 --> 23:59.898
but he lost the job
after having problems

23:59.984 --> 24:01.450
getting the ball over the plate.

24:01.485 --> 24:03.902
Mountain leads the
league in hit batsmen.

24:09.410 --> 24:12.527
And the new
catcher for the Cardinals, Davis,

24:12.657 --> 24:15.074
Mount's favorite
batterymate, enters the game.

24:15.126 --> 24:16.659
He'll hit in the ninth spot.

24:21.316 --> 24:23.349
You got to get through this.

24:23.401 --> 24:25.017
For Drake.

24:25.103 --> 24:27.687
Yeah, who else is he going
to scare up for that party?

24:27.739 --> 24:30.857
The question is whether
Buck Garland is going to use

24:30.942 --> 24:33.442
a pinch-hitter given what
just happened last inning.

24:33.528 --> 24:36.462
Yeah, tough position for a
guy managing his first game, Dick.

24:36.514 --> 24:38.381
He's got the lefty Stubbs,
on the bench...

24:51.613 --> 24:53.362
Wow.

24:53.448 --> 24:54.780
Not bad.

24:54.832 --> 24:58.451
Not bad? It's called raking.

24:58.536 --> 25:00.453
Okay. Let's get this.

25:06.294 --> 25:07.793
What are you doing?

25:07.845 --> 25:10.546
Giving you a little tip. ‭Okay.

25:10.632 --> 25:13.132
- Okay. When you bring the club back,
- ‭Yeah.

25:13.218 --> 25:15.351
- Turn your hips.
- ‭All right.

25:15.436 --> 25:16.969
Weight on your back foot.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.640
You know, swinging a golf
club is the last thing

25:20.692 --> 25:23.142
that I'm thinking about
right now, right?

25:23.194 --> 25:26.028
Careful, though, someone
might be watching us.

25:26.114 --> 25:27.980
Hey, relax, relax.

25:28.032 --> 25:29.712
No one's watching
us, and even if they are,

25:29.784 --> 25:31.317
who cares?

25:31.402 --> 25:33.986
I'm a private citizen.

25:34.072 --> 25:35.454
Not yet you're not.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.323
I'm into you, Ginny.

25:37.408 --> 25:38.991
I'm into you, Trevor.

25:39.077 --> 25:41.210
No, but I want people to know about it.

25:41.296 --> 25:44.714
I want you to come to my games

25:44.799 --> 25:46.749
and sit in the stands, not your car.

25:48.670 --> 25:50.086
No.

25:51.589 --> 25:54.340
Look, I want to show you off.

25:54.425 --> 25:56.759
I want people, when they look at us,

25:56.844 --> 25:59.228
as a couple, to say,

25:59.314 --> 26:02.732
"Wow. That guy out-punted
his coverage."

26:08.906 --> 26:11.274
Oh!

26:11.359 --> 26:13.824
Nothing to see
here, folks. We're all good.

26:13.982 --> 26:15.077
Just two regular people.

26:15.163 --> 26:17.106
Nothing to do with baseball whatsoever.

26:57.238 --> 27:00.573
Oh, my. So, Buck is
going to let Ginny Baker

27:00.658 --> 27:02.458
face the big right-hander Greg Mount,

27:02.543 --> 27:04.994
and you can feel the
blood pressure spiking

27:05.079 --> 27:07.413
here at Petco.

27:07.465 --> 27:09.715
It's a big enough
challenge for the first woman

27:09.751 --> 27:11.343
in Major League Baseball to compete

27:11.344 --> 27:12.325
against men in the sport,

27:12.326 --> 27:14.420
but now things could get really ugly.

27:14.505 --> 27:16.088
Lawson.

27:16.140 --> 27:17.757
Lawson!

27:17.842 --> 27:19.558
You can't let her hit.

27:19.594 --> 27:22.478
I bet Ginny didn't
wake up this morning

27:22.563 --> 27:26.766
thinking she'd be right in
the middle of a beanball war.

27:26.818 --> 27:29.068
Be ready. Right behind you.

27:29.103 --> 27:31.103
All right. Here we go.

27:34.108 --> 27:37.743
Mountain in his windup.

27:39.197 --> 27:41.197
- Look out!
- Ball.

27:41.282 --> 27:43.666
That one almost
took Crawford's head off!

27:56.964 --> 27:57.630
Ball.

28:07.442 --> 28:08.307
Ball.

28:09.811 --> 28:12.445
Is he scared of hurting
me? Get back in the box.

28:12.480 --> 28:13.946
Mount can't find the plate.

28:13.981 --> 28:16.282
He's certainly not
afraid of Ginny Baker.

28:16.317 --> 28:18.033
She's hitting 0 for the summer.

28:18.119 --> 28:19.485
Are you afraid of hurting me?

28:19.537 --> 28:21.287
Get back in the box.

28:21.322 --> 28:22.716
Got a little chirping going
on down there at home plate

28:22.740 --> 28:24.156
between Davis and Baker.

28:24.242 --> 28:25.324
You are!

28:25.410 --> 28:28.244
I said get back in the damn box.

28:41.067 --> 28:42.182
Hey!

28:42.268 --> 28:43.434
How you doing?

28:43.486 --> 28:44.652
What happened?

28:44.737 --> 28:46.603
Why'd they pull you out?

28:46.656 --> 28:50.274
Oh... I got traded.

28:50.359 --> 28:51.992
To the Cardinals.

28:52.078 --> 28:53.327
Well, Memphis, actually.

28:53.412 --> 28:54.611
Their Triple A team.

28:54.697 --> 28:55.946
- Wow. That's great.
- Yeah.

28:56.032 --> 28:57.247
What about college?

28:57.283 --> 28:58.782
Well, it's gonna have to wait, right?

28:58.834 --> 29:01.585
I mean, I got an actual
shot at the show now.

29:01.620 --> 29:02.920
Can you believe it?

29:05.675 --> 29:07.341
Were you really going to quit the game?

29:07.426 --> 29:08.709
Yes. Of course.

29:08.794 --> 29:10.349
I mean, I was surprised when I found out

29:10.350 --> 29:12.720
- the Cardinals were scouting me, but...
- ‭Scouting you?

29:12.765 --> 29:15.966
So, if the Cardinals have
been scouting you, then you've been

29:16.052 --> 29:18.102
thinking about sticking with
baseball for a while?

29:18.137 --> 29:20.582
- Uh, well, Ginny... - You lied when
you told me you wanted me to come

29:20.606 --> 29:21.783
- to your last games?
- Ginny, you're in Midland.

29:21.807 --> 29:23.307
Okay? No one knows you're here.

29:23.392 --> 29:25.392
What do you...? They know about us.

29:25.478 --> 29:27.311
Soon, everyone will.

29:27.396 --> 29:28.674
Look, if I quit the
game and we stay together,

29:28.698 --> 29:30.175
people will know I'm an ex-ballplayer,

29:30.199 --> 29:31.815
so I thought, hey, what's the big deal

29:31.867 --> 29:33.784
if you came to one of
my games, right?

29:33.819 --> 29:35.703
And, plus, you broke your rule already.

29:35.788 --> 29:37.488
What is your problem?

29:37.540 --> 29:39.301
Like, you're supposed to
be happy for me, right?

29:39.325 --> 29:40.624
You're right. I should be.

29:40.659 --> 29:42.493
If we would have just stayed friends,

29:42.578 --> 29:44.128
if I wouldn't have broke...

29:45.631 --> 29:47.414
I'm an idiot.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.049
Why are you getting so emotional?

29:49.135 --> 29:51.301
Come on. Nut up.

29:51.337 --> 29:54.004
Ginny.

29:54.090 --> 29:55.567
Come on. Like, I'm so... it's a joke.

29:55.591 --> 29:56.807
It was your joke. Come on!

29:56.842 --> 29:59.476
- They let you play, huh?
- Shut up.

29:59.512 --> 30:01.432
Here we go,
Mark. 3 and 0 to Ginny Baker.

30:01.514 --> 30:04.398
Davis gives the sign.

30:05.768 --> 30:07.351
Mount into the windup.

30:08.988 --> 30:11.822
Way outside! Ball four!

30:11.857 --> 30:14.441
Hey, what's a girl got
to do to get beaned, huh?

30:14.527 --> 30:16.870
And Ginny Baker is
walking toward the mound!

30:16.872 --> 30:18.078
43, take your base!

30:18.164 --> 30:19.474
Yeah, I got this. The
hell are you doing?

30:19.498 --> 30:21.176
You started walking, keep
walking, all right?

30:21.200 --> 30:22.811
Why you being so
emotional, Trevor? Nut up!

30:22.835 --> 30:23.867
- Huh? Nut up!
- ‭Stop it.

30:23.953 --> 30:25.702
Hey, you two, take
it up... Hey, you two!

30:27.089 --> 30:28.839
Oh, my, here we go!

30:28.874 --> 30:31.041
Both benches are emptying!

30:40.067 --> 30:41.733
Are you okay?

30:41.818 --> 30:43.568
Come on, Blip, get in there!

30:43.620 --> 30:45.737
I wasn't gonna hit her, Mike, I swear.

30:45.822 --> 30:46.988
It's okay, Mountain.

30:47.074 --> 30:49.074
This is a no-win for me. It's okay.

30:49.126 --> 30:50.386
Come on, I got you.
I got you, all right.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.043
- Just let it go.
- Stay here.

30:52.079 --> 30:53.878
I'm too old for this crap.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.227
Come on down
and break your boys up.

30:58.251 --> 31:00.085
Get them along the
first base line, okay?

31:00.170 --> 31:04.222
43 Padres, 45
Padres, you're out of here!

31:18.271 --> 31:19.771
Ooh, Max is here.

31:19.856 --> 31:20.917
Now we can get down to business.

31:20.941 --> 31:22.073
Sorry I'm late.

31:22.109 --> 31:23.575
No problem.

31:23.610 --> 31:26.027
Al deserved a last supper.

31:26.113 --> 31:28.613
Gentlemen, could I have the room?

31:38.091 --> 31:39.791
Come on, Frank.

31:39.843 --> 31:42.927
Al has won more
games, more division titles,

31:42.963 --> 31:44.929
than any manager in franchise history.

31:44.965 --> 31:48.266
Excuse me, Max, but I don't recall
you citing a World Series

31:48.301 --> 31:49.612
anywhere among Al's greatest hits.

31:49.636 --> 31:50.769
There's a reason

31:50.804 --> 31:52.854
why baseball decisions are left

31:52.939 --> 31:55.106
to a league-approved control person.

31:55.142 --> 31:57.025
And I, for one, am glad

31:57.110 --> 31:58.705
that a man of your
principles is at the helm.

31:58.729 --> 31:59.978
You, for one?

32:00.063 --> 32:01.696
What, does everybody else hate the way

32:01.782 --> 32:03.398
- I'm doing my job here?
- No.

32:03.483 --> 32:05.116
No, of course not.

32:05.152 --> 32:06.846
Everyone is very pleased with
your performance here.

32:06.870 --> 32:08.570
Thank you, thank you.

32:08.655 --> 32:10.905
It's more about how
you're doing at AerynTech.

32:13.577 --> 32:15.160
I don't have to remind you

32:15.245 --> 32:16.795
that AerynTech Corporation

32:16.830 --> 32:19.047
spent the $700 million on the Padres

32:19.132 --> 32:20.749
and put you in charge of the club.

32:20.834 --> 32:22.050
Then why are you reminding me?

32:22.135 --> 32:25.220
Because if you were
ousted as CEO of AerynTech,

32:25.305 --> 32:28.173
unfairly and unjustly made the scapegoat

32:28.225 --> 32:29.557
for the company's

32:29.643 --> 32:32.143
stagnant earnings of late,

32:32.179 --> 32:34.596
then, within a few
days, you would also be out

32:34.681 --> 32:36.598
as the control person of the Padres.

32:36.683 --> 32:39.316
Is there something that I
should know about you and Al?

32:40.168 --> 32:42.118
- Careful, Frank.
- Careful?

32:42.203 --> 32:43.836
- Me, careful?
- Look,

32:43.922 --> 32:45.621
I'm not the one who's blaming you

32:45.674 --> 32:47.340
for the company's tough year,

32:47.425 --> 32:49.959
any more than you're
blaming Al for a 500 record.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.929
So I applaud your decision

32:52.964 --> 32:55.098
to stand behind him, and
I think the other owners

32:55.133 --> 32:56.432
will do the same. Maxine, I am

32:56.468 --> 32:57.850
never going to go along with this.

32:57.936 --> 32:59.852
And if you think I am, you're crazy.

32:59.938 --> 33:01.888
Damn it, Frank. And I could make this

33:01.973 --> 33:04.807
a very messy divorce.

33:07.696 --> 33:11.030
Well, we are gonna miss you around here.

33:20.208 --> 33:23.493
Well, the fans sure got their
money's worth today,

33:23.578 --> 33:26.496
don't you think?

33:30.917 --> 33:34.194
Oh, Al. Al, I just wanted to me down

33:34.246 --> 33:36.029
and tell you to ignore those rumors

33:36.114 --> 33:38.448
flying around that your
job might be in jeopardy.

33:38.533 --> 33:40.333
- It's been settled.
- Thanks.

33:40.368 --> 33:42.085
I appreciate that, Frank.

33:42.170 --> 33:44.754
Means a lot.

33:44.839 --> 33:46.589
Um...

33:48.126 --> 33:50.927
Al, Al, hey.

33:51.012 --> 33:54.514
Look, I, uh... I know we're
not in a good place.

33:54.549 --> 33:56.933
You have your job
to do, and I have mine.

33:57.018 --> 34:00.436
And part of mine is telling Woo-jin
he has to go back down.

34:00.522 --> 34:02.222
Sure.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.057
Thing is, we don't have an interpreter.

34:04.142 --> 34:05.558
Oh?

34:05.644 --> 34:07.227
Okay.

34:07.279 --> 34:08.393
Yo!

34:08.480 --> 34:10.480
Woo-jin!

34:27.581 --> 34:30.583
Okay.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.389
Good kid.

34:36.424 --> 34:39.391
Yeah.

34:39.427 --> 34:44.347
People who
underestimate me tend to be surprised.

34:44.431 --> 34:46.766
Man, I ate too much, Oscar.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.685
I got to drop a deuce.

34:50.572 --> 34:52.105
Don't make a big deal out of this.

34:52.190 --> 34:54.357
It wasn't exactly a
fight between me and Lonnie.

34:54.442 --> 34:56.192
It was more like a slow dance.

34:56.277 --> 34:57.910
Although he did try to dip me.

35:00.615 --> 35:01.831
Al,

35:01.916 --> 35:03.116
getting tossed before a game.

35:03.168 --> 35:04.500
That's a first for you.

35:04.586 --> 35:06.452
Well, now it's off the bucket list.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.454
For your first Major League win.

35:08.506 --> 35:10.290
Yeah.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.292
I won't open this up in here.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.344
Eh, you better not.

35:14.429 --> 35:16.462
No, no, no, sit, sit.

35:16.514 --> 35:17.630
Today the chair is yours.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.599
You earned it.

35:19.634 --> 35:22.185
Thanks for taking care of us

35:22.234 --> 35:23.834
and letting us pillage your dad's suite.

35:23.888 --> 35:25.772
Yeah. Any time.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.727
Hi. Did you guys have fun? Hi. Yeah.

35:30.812 --> 35:33.479
Yeah? I have a surprise for you. Okay.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.365
Oh, my God.

35:35.450 --> 35:36.730
Hey. I want you to meet someone.

35:36.785 --> 35:38.534
Hi, Daniella.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.486
- Hello.
- Sorry about today.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.488
Kind of lost my temper.
This role model thing's

35:42.574 --> 35:44.290
- still new to me.
- That's okay.

35:44.326 --> 35:45.541
I-I've been there.

35:45.627 --> 35:46.959
All right then.

35:46.995 --> 35:48.711
Can I get a picture with you?

35:48.797 --> 35:50.246
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.586
Cheese.

35:56.671 --> 35:59.339
I'll share that with your dad.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.174
- Take care, Daniella.
- Thanks.

36:01.226 --> 36:03.843
- So cool. Yeah? All right.
- Yeah.

36:03.895 --> 36:07.146
Hey, listen, uh, before your mom comes,

36:07.182 --> 36:09.148
I want to talk to you
about something, okay?

36:09.184 --> 36:10.850
Let's-let's go somewhere quiet.

36:10.935 --> 36:12.685
No.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.355
Sweetie, this isn't the place.

36:15.407 --> 36:17.106
You're not staying over tonight.

36:19.077 --> 36:21.027
No.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.696
I don't think me
sleeping in the guest room

36:23.748 --> 36:25.281
one time a week is...

36:25.367 --> 36:28.201
is such a good idea, you know? It's...

36:28.286 --> 36:31.421
it's confusing.

36:31.506 --> 36:33.539
Because you and Mom are
going to make it official.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.925
You're getting a divorce.

36:43.218 --> 36:45.385
Let's go somewhere else and talk, okay?

36:45.437 --> 36:47.186
No, okay? Not today.

36:47.222 --> 36:49.389
I don't want a good
day to end like this.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.641
You're right. This isn't the place.

36:52.861 --> 36:55.395
Yeah. Okay.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.197
All right.

36:58.233 --> 37:01.492
I don't care. You can't come
down to the field and yell at me.

37:01.493 --> 37:04.237
When it comes to protecting
Ginny, I will yell at the Pope.

37:04.289 --> 37:06.239
All right? She needs
to make her money now.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.458
Who knows how long she's
gonna be up here?

37:08.543 --> 37:11.494
I like her chances of sticking around.

37:11.579 --> 37:13.045
What's wrong?

37:13.081 --> 37:14.630
It's my back.

37:14.716 --> 37:17.750
Is there anything I can do?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.051
You two have met?

37:19.087 --> 37:20.803
Hey. Uh, yeah.

37:20.889 --> 37:22.638
You scared the hell out of me.

37:22.724 --> 37:25.808
You? The Mountain
throws 98 miles an hour.

37:25.894 --> 37:28.845
And I'm just saying you could've
mixed it up a little,

37:28.930 --> 37:30.480
you know? Like, got in there.

37:30.565 --> 37:33.433
Oh, yeah, and got
suspended for throwing a punch

37:33.485 --> 37:35.318
and fined ten grand?

37:35.403 --> 37:37.153
I know that's just a handbag for you,

37:37.238 --> 37:39.739
but that's a lot of money to me.

37:44.412 --> 37:46.279
What's he doing here?

37:46.364 --> 37:48.080
Old friend. I got this.

38:02.964 --> 38:05.548
Just give me one night with you.

38:05.633 --> 38:07.183
I want to make it to the Show,

38:07.268 --> 38:09.385
and one night with
you could get me there.

38:09.471 --> 38:11.137
It worked for Trevor Davis.

38:13.475 --> 38:17.026
One night with me won't fix
that sorry-ass swing of yours, DC.

38:23.485 --> 38:24.734
Hey.

38:24.819 --> 38:28.821
I just wanted to, uh, say sorry.

38:28.873 --> 38:31.123
Forget about it. I lost
my cool. No, no. I meant

38:31.159 --> 38:32.992
how it ended in Texas.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.878
I didn't fully appreciate
what you had to go through.

38:35.964 --> 38:37.997
Still go through.

38:40.802 --> 38:42.502
I'm glad you made it up here, Trevor.

38:42.554 --> 38:43.719
You worked hard.

38:47.141 --> 38:48.674
I got to go. ‭Uh, Ginny,

38:48.726 --> 38:50.643
um...

38:50.678 --> 38:52.323
the reason why I wanted
to actually speak to you

38:52.347 --> 38:54.013
is that, uh...

38:54.098 --> 38:57.016
I got notifications that
my passwords were changed.

38:57.101 --> 38:58.568
- So?
- So...

38:58.653 --> 38:59.986
I got hacked.

39:00.021 --> 39:01.687
Yeah. They gained access

39:01.739 --> 39:03.439
to, like, my banking information,

39:03.525 --> 39:06.192
credit card info, and pictures.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.945
Selfies that we took from the road.

39:09.030 --> 39:11.497
You told me you deleted
those. Yeah, I did.

39:11.533 --> 39:13.583
But they were backed up.

39:13.668 --> 39:16.035
Why didn't you
tell me this a year ago?

39:16.087 --> 39:17.231
Well, because I didn't know you'd be

39:17.255 --> 39:18.754
the most famous woman on the planet.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.351
‭And if you'd picked up my calls

39:20.375 --> 39:22.592
or answered a text
message, I would have told you.

39:22.677 --> 39:24.355
- Trevor, if you shared those
pictures with anyone... - Never.

39:24.379 --> 39:26.846
What kind of guy do you think I am?

39:28.766 --> 39:30.716
Hey.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.269
A little advice from a
former friend, all right?

39:33.354 --> 39:34.937
You can take it or leave it.

39:35.023 --> 39:37.557
But all this attention and celebrity,

39:37.642 --> 39:39.942
it's only gonna get worse.

39:40.028 --> 39:41.394
The world has fallen for you.

39:41.446 --> 39:43.446
And take it from a guy that knows,

39:43.531 --> 39:46.315
that doesn't just disappear.

39:46.401 --> 39:49.285
So you better find a
friend and let 'em in, all right?

39:49.370 --> 39:52.405
'Cause all of this is way
too much for one person.

39:54.542 --> 39:58.494
Even the most famous woman on the
planet needs a golf partner.

39:59.747 --> 40:02.548
I got to go.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.222
Everything all right?

40:10.258 --> 40:13.259
- Yeah. Yes.
- Okay.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.895
Sorry I went rogue today.

40:15.930 --> 40:17.096
No, you're not.

40:17.181 --> 40:18.061
You're right. I'm not.

40:21.853 --> 40:26.105
Why were you talking to a
guy we just got in a brawl with?

40:26.157 --> 40:28.107
Like I said, old friends.

40:28.192 --> 40:30.610
We used to play
against each other in Texas.

40:30.662 --> 40:34.280
Huh. Must be some bad blood.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.332
Just a healthy rivalry.

40:36.417 --> 40:40.419
You're choosing your words carefully.

40:40.455 --> 40:42.455
I am choosing my words carefully.

40:42.540 --> 40:46.425
Every choice I make,
I have to think about.

40:46.461 --> 40:50.096
Any other damn pitcher on
this team, you would have told them

40:50.131 --> 40:52.298
- to knock Falcone on his ass.
- Fair enough.

40:52.350 --> 40:53.360
- And don't tell me you
wouldn't have... - ‭Hey,

40:53.384 --> 40:54.967
I just said you were right, Baker.

40:55.053 --> 40:58.020
Geez.

40:58.106 --> 41:00.973
16 years I've been playing in this town.

41:01.025 --> 41:02.808
I've seen a lot of rookies come and go.

41:02.860 --> 41:05.194
Never met one like you.

41:05.279 --> 41:07.730
- Yeah, well...
- And not because you're a girl.

41:07.815 --> 41:12.034
It's what you're doing, it's
what you're having to take on.

41:13.154 --> 41:15.871
You kind of blow me away.

41:20.828 --> 41:22.294
Hey, you play golf?

41:22.330 --> 41:23.746
Do I look like I play golf?

41:23.831 --> 41:25.392
You look like a
cousin from Duck Dynasty.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.750
- You love the beard.
- I do not.

41:27.835 --> 41:29.113
That's because you have
a different image of me,

41:29.137 --> 41:31.170
probably from all those
posters you had hanging up

41:31.255 --> 41:33.889
- on your bedroom wall.
- Oh, I did not have posters of you

41:33.975 --> 41:35.319
- hanging on my bedroom wall.
- Okay.

41:37.145 --> 41:38.310
Lawson,

41:38.346 --> 41:39.512
let's go. I'm buying.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.847
I'm gonna call it early tonight, boys.

41:41.899 --> 41:42.848
Damn. Old Man Lawson.

41:42.900 --> 41:43.649
I know, right?

41:47.071 --> 41:48.854
But I guess you could come.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.359
Well, since you're begging me, Tommy.

41:55.196 --> 41:56.862
Pick it up later?

41:56.914 --> 41:58.364
Nothing to pick up.
