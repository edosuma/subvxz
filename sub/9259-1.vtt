00:34.360 --> 00:37.033
George, alley's blocked off.
Take the back.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.032
Yes, sir.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.758
- Suspect's inside. We're ready.
- Let's do it.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.510
Get your hands on your head.
Right now. Get down. Get down.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.790
Don't move. Stay right there.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.514
You got the ink, I got the paper.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.393
Hey, dog! Dog!

01:13.920 --> 01:15.990
That's one way to get him to heel.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.677
Six grand, two dozen DVD players,
a loaded strap. Sweet.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.395
I called it a code four.
Since the only casualty was Cujo.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.114
- I didn't even hear him.
- Suspect cut the vocal chords.

01:27.320 --> 01:29.117
Didn't your TO warn you
they do that now?

01:29.320 --> 01:32.949
- The assistant chief's on his way down.
- Goddamn it.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.591
Good luck, rookie.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.875
You would have been better
off shooting the suspect.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.308
Why?

01:41.360 --> 01:43.828
The ass chief figures
it's just a matter of time...

01:44.040 --> 01:47.396
...before someone mistakes a kid
coming around a corner for Rover.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.192
Truth is, the wife raises cockapoos.

01:51.400 --> 01:54.392
Probably stops giving him hummers
every time a mutt gets shot.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.955
Didn't you read his mandate
a couple of months back?

01:57.160 --> 01:59.799
I just started last week.
What's he coming down here for?

02:00.000 --> 02:01.752
I'm sure it's not to give you a medal.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.191
Don't sweat it.
We'll figure something out.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.634
Oh, shit.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.836
Asst. Chief Phillips, you didn't
need to come all the way down here.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.315
- Another dog was shot?
- Nobody else was, thank God.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.239
And we nailed Billings'
armed robbery suspect.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.873
Got all the stolen merchandise.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.159
- Where's the triggerman?
- Kid's just a rookie, sir.

02:28.360 --> 02:31.397
- Too young to read mandates?
- There was nothing he could've done.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.750
Is he the shooter?

02:33.960 --> 02:38.397
Sir, I'm telling you, the kid
had no choice. The dog was reaching.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.279
It was kill or be killed.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.912
Oh, come on, Roy.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.998
If the dog had a piece,
he was gonna use it.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.350
Nice collar.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.312
Who was that?

03:22.720 --> 03:25.996
David Aceveda, Monica Rawling,
your replacement.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.353
Hi, I didn't expect to see you
until next week.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.836
Well, I'm using vacation time to see
what I'm getting myself into.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.354
Well, congratulations.

03:36.600 --> 03:39.194
I think it should be
the other way around. City council.

03:39.440 --> 03:40.668
I'm honoured to serve.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.189
Monica started as a patrol officer
in Farmington.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.911
Yeah, everyone knows
you put in your time.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.872
I can't wait to see
what she's like now.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.274
Well, if there's anything
I can do to help...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.516
Well, I'd love to meet the troops.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.196
If I know unis, rumours are flying
like bills in a strip club.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.550
Guys, I'd like to introduce you
to Monica Rawling.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.036
- The new captain of the Barn.
- Hello.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.912
That Aceveda's replacement?

04:11.640 --> 04:12.993
I have no idea.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.593
I thought Troy Akerman was in.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.360
From Robbery-Homicide,
this real detective's detective.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.757
It's funny.
I heard he didn't have a clue.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.269
I just didn't expect them to go
for another woman.

04:23.520 --> 04:26.353
You know, I mean,
after they torpedoed you.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.838
Hey, at least it's a fresh start
for us, right?

04:31.480 --> 04:34.711
And Diane, right?

04:34.920 --> 04:36.148
You've done your homework.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.432
Well, I've gone through
everyone's packages.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.710
So I have the dirt on all of you.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.996
Come on, let me show you
around some more.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.753
It'll be good working with you.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.276
Monica Rawling, these are
Detectives Wagenbach and Wyms.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.511
- Your new captain.
- Dutch Wagenbach.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.990
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hello, Dutch.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.879
And you must be Claudette.
I've heard a lot about you.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.877
I'm sure you have.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.436
Yeah, but we'll make it work anyway.

05:06.120 --> 05:08.554
So let's see the rest of the place.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.832
Don't let that fresh start
hit you in the ass.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.396
Screamer, moaner?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.716
Dude, you gotta start getting
your own snatch.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.033
Vic Mackey, Ronnie Gardocki...

05:24.240 --> 05:27.312
...I'd like to present the next captain
of the Barn, Monica Rawling.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.272
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.040
Yeah, yeah, we met.
Thanks for the backup out there.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.071
Thanks for the laugh.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.155
So, what is this? Mission control?

05:37.360 --> 05:39.590
Well, we call it the Garage Sting.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.951
We're targeting a custom car outfit
that's been washing dirty money...

05:43.160 --> 05:45.754
- ... for a number of criminal enterprises.
- How's it going?

05:45.960 --> 05:48.428
Six months in, gearing up
for the mother of all sweeps.

05:48.640 --> 05:52.189
- How many bad guys you expect?
- About three dozen, right?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.756
More or less.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.678
Let me introduce you
to our watch commander.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.111
I am dying to get out
onto the streets.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.198
Can you spare Detective Mackey
a few hours to give me the tour?

06:04.080 --> 06:07.072
Sure. But just a few.
He does have tapes to log.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.478
Feel like some fresh air?

06:12.000 --> 06:15.037
That hardware store
used to be a butcher shop.

06:15.240 --> 06:18.038
- They ran numbers in the back.
- Now it dabbles in ID theft.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.391
Yeah, well,
things just change sideways.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.830
You miss the street?

06:24.040 --> 06:26.110
Three years heading up
domestic abuse.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.356
Heard that unit really turned around.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.118
Well, I did what I could there.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.791
I see the Farm's as rough as ever.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.595
You know these people.
You do what you can.

06:38.120 --> 06:40.236
But you offer them a hand,
they slap it away.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.991
Why'd they shut
your Strike Team down?

06:47.800 --> 06:49.279
A couple of guys moved on.

06:50.160 --> 06:52.355
One got into a car accident.

06:52.560 --> 06:54.198
No money to restock.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.397
Department's really quick
to save a dime...

06:57.600 --> 07:00.990
...even if it means pulling the plug
on something that works.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.679
Sounds like you're the one
who misses the street now.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.552
I'll be back on it soon.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.639
- Wrapping up the Garage Sting?
- More like leaving it behind.

07:11.840 --> 07:14.195
Requesting additional units
for a 187 crime scene...

07:14.400 --> 07:16.391
...multiple victims, Pavo Real Motel.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.156
Oh, shit.

07:19.720 --> 07:23.713
- Taking the call?
- Yeah, I know that place.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.958
The Veneza family, all locals.
Checked in last month.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.599
Why were they staying here?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.870
They were evicted from their house
on Hoover...

07:35.080 --> 07:37.435
...been charging the room to several
over-maxed credit cards.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.631
Been slipping
through the cracks for a while.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.593
No gunshots. Looks like
they're all drowned in the bathtub.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.995
Don't want the new captain thinking
I left a mess.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.952
I want this wrapped up
before next week.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.673
Dutch and I caught this one.

07:48.880 --> 07:52.350
And if I leave you two as the leads,
the DA will screw it to death.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.597
Even they're not stupid enough to get
in the way of four homicides.

07:55.800 --> 08:00.669
- We'll never know. Answer to Billings.
- The DA put you two on the list, not me.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.389
Feeling the love?

08:05.600 --> 08:08.512
- How can I help?
- See if the car's in the lot.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.712
Then give the unis a hand
with witness statements.

08:11.920 --> 08:13.478
Thanks.

08:14.360 --> 08:17.238
Bathroom.
Family of four drowned one by one.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.556
Damn.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.469
Welcome back to Farmington.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.837
That's when I heard
somebody scream.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.957
- Did you call for help?
- No.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.475
- Why not?
- I had a mouthful of dick at the time.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.953
- Lovely.
- Found something.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.437
A key to some sort of pay locker?

08:50.680 --> 08:53.194
We got the needle.
All we need's a haystack.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.390
- Oh, we've got bigger problems.
- What's that?

08:56.600 --> 08:59.160
Why would you need
a booster seat unless...?

08:59.400 --> 09:00.833
- There's a missing kid.
- How old?

09:01.040 --> 09:03.713
No idea. If the killer's got him,
he's not the nurturing type.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.434
Where's the mom's purse?
Somebody check in there.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.272
I got it.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.191
Boy. Looks 2 or 3.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.434
Check with the detectives.
There's a little boy missing.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.835
You going somewhere?

09:31.040 --> 09:33.838
Pico One-Niners run junk
out of this place.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.156
No one does anything
without them knowing it.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.715
Could you get a ride back
to the Barn with the unis?

09:38.920 --> 09:41.514
Yeah, I'm sure I could,
but I signed up for the full tour.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.320
- Hey, yo.
- What up?

09:49.520 --> 09:51.511
Somebody offed a family
at the Pavo Real.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.075
He drowned them in the tub,
then took the little kid.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.793
- First I'm hearing it.
- Yeah?

09:56.000 --> 09:58.958
I know you maggots use that motel
like it's a frat house.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.476
Give us back the boy alive and I won't
burn your cash cow to the ground.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.477
We ain't been
in that spot for a minute.

10:04.680 --> 10:05.908
Get your facts straight.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.793
Hey, big man,
you wanna get into it?

10:09.600 --> 10:11.556
Come over here.

10:12.160 --> 10:15.470
- What's your name?
- T-Gun.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.035
Turn around, T-Gun.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.315
Put your hands on your head.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.797
Still jousting and rousting?

10:29.000 --> 10:32.072
Yeah, well, I wouldn't be surprised
if I ran in your old man.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.556
- Never knew my pops.
- Yeah, well, I bet I did.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.830
What's this?

10:38.680 --> 10:41.274
Are you on probation, T-Gun?

10:42.040 --> 10:44.679
- Yes, ma'am.
- And you're carrying a knife?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.996
- When you gonna get it right?
- Never.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.988
He'll be a shithead his whole life, which
at this rate will be a couple of months.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.270
How about our missing kid?

10:53.480 --> 10:55.675
We don't know shit.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.758
- I'll just keep your ID, okay?
- What for?

10:58.960 --> 11:01.315
I gotta write up the blade
but I don't have time now.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.353
So come by the Farmington station
and ask for the new captain.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.677
Otherwise,
I know where to find you, Gunther.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.513
That was a waste.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.395
We stirred up the pot.
Now, we'll see what boils over.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.512
You all know Assistant DA Insardi.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.593
- Have you identified the child yet?
- Little Eddie, 3 years old.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.199
I've got the crime lab rushing.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.198
Robbery? Kidnapping? Why kill
the people who'd pay the ransom?

11:25.400 --> 11:28.278
- Some other reason?
- Found a pay locker key in the car.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.835
Dutch and Claudette
will run down nearby businesses.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.838
Kid missing, your office
wants us on locker-hunting scut work?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.110
Excuse me?
I don't hand out assignments here.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.198
You know what I'm talking about.
Your office has blackballed us.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.072
Shut it down, Dutch. Find the locker.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.989
I can think of some possibilities.
Come on. Let's make ourselves useful.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.072
Any chance you can stop by to sign
that realtor's agreement today?

11:51.280 --> 11:52.759
Yeah, next to none.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.036
She needs your signature
to show the house.

11:55.280 --> 11:59.671
Listen, can you drop off the paperwork
at the Barn after you're done?

12:01.040 --> 12:04.430
Sure. Cassidy still got the sniffles?

12:04.640 --> 12:07.359
No, she's better.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.790
What about Matthew and Megan,
what are they up to?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.514
Matthew's been great this week.
He's in a good routine.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.392
Wish I could say the same.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.990
Listen, I gotta go.
I'm kind of tailing someone.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.237
- Okay, don't lose him.
- Okay, good.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.239
Wife?

12:28.960 --> 12:31.520
- Soon-to-be-ex.
- Sorry.

12:33.640 --> 12:35.710
So you're planning
on leaving the Barn?

12:35.960 --> 12:39.748
You might as well know I put in
to head up the new Street Crime Detail.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.070
The citywide thing?

12:42.840 --> 12:45.070
Paul Reyes took that.

12:46.120 --> 12:51.240
- Reyes? No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, last night.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.109
He's been kicking ass in Inglewood.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.236
Good for him.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.111
- Respect!
- We're only killing ourselves.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.436
Our sisters need us.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.110
They're raising our babies alone...

13:10.320 --> 13:14.029
...while we're out in the street
chasing women, money or drugs...

13:14.240 --> 13:16.037
...instead of giving them respect.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.468
Respect!

13:17.680 --> 13:19.830
Our babies, they need us
in their lives.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.192
Not in jail, not in the street
and not in the grave.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.393
Our mothers need us.

13:27.280 --> 13:31.831
Too many have cried too many tears,
buried too many sons.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.435
Our brothers,
they need us lifting each other up...

13:38.640 --> 13:40.392
...and not shooting them down.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.468
Is that respect?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.153
Respect!

13:44.360 --> 13:48.114
- Antwon Mitchell, O.G. One-Niner.
- Yeah, I know Antwon.

13:48.320 --> 13:53.633
There's the Harbour set,
Warren, Crenshaw.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.110
- Pico.
- Came straight through the wall.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.079
And his woman had to shield
their baby.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.236
A lot of these folks
aren't wearing colours.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.908
A lot of them just citizens.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.712
Killing that child.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.480
We're keeping the gravediggers
too busy...

14:08.680 --> 14:10.989
...and that's a damn shame.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.837
And I guess the police,
they need us too.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.757
You put more than two black men
together and look who shows up?

14:18.960 --> 14:20.837
Hey, but you know what?

14:21.080 --> 14:25.517
It's our own fault,
because we commit the crimes.

14:25.720 --> 14:27.233
I did myself.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.675
I slung rock, messed people up.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.354
But I don't fight the power anymore.

14:36.920 --> 14:41.357
We got to be about changing
that power.

14:41.600 --> 14:46.754
And you, keep your heads up.
Be a man. Demand respect.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.188
Respect!

14:48.400 --> 14:51.756
Because sooner or later,
they got to give it to you.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.269
You take the skills
that they forced on us...

14:54.520 --> 14:58.638
...slanging, pimping, surviving.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.675
These are business skills, skills
that we need to open our restaurants...

15:04.280 --> 15:07.033
...our banks, shops that we own.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.310
Take back this neighbourhood
and make it ours.

15:09.520 --> 15:10.794
Then, we'll get respect.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.911
- Respect!
- Respect!

15:13.120 --> 15:14.678
- Respect!
- Respect!

15:14.880 --> 15:16.438
- Respect!
- Respect!

15:16.640 --> 15:18.073
- Respect!
- Keep saying it.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.952
- Respect!
- Say it again.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.428
- Respect!
- Keep saying it!

15:21.640 --> 15:22.959
- Respect!
- Live for it!

15:23.160 --> 15:24.388
- Respect!
- Die for it!

15:24.600 --> 15:26.556
- Respect!
- Sleep with it! Eat with it!

15:26.760 --> 15:27.988
- Respect!
- Get it!

15:28.200 --> 15:29.428
- Respect!
- Get it!

15:29.640 --> 15:31.790
- Respect! Respect!
- Get it!

15:32.040 --> 15:33.519
We've been frozen out for months.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.790
They'll take us out
of the doghouse eventually.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.433
Yeah. When?

15:37.640 --> 15:40.359
What do you want me to do, Dutch?
Take obedience training?

15:40.560 --> 15:43.870
If the DA's waiting for me to apologise,
hell isn't nearly cold enough.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.913
And you're happy to let my career rot
along with yours, huh?

15:47.120 --> 15:48.519
I appreciate your support.

15:48.720 --> 15:51.951
I won't hold it against you
if you wanna put in for a new partner.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.953
So I can either be a traitor
or a coward? Thanks.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.236
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, I won't.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.553
These match.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.028
Yeah?

16:04.160 --> 16:06.754
You could definitely fit a child
in there.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.948
Or a shitload of cash.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.515
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.558
What are you doing, man? Come on.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.553
Hey, baby, you want some more?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.073
Yeah.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.313
Stank, come on.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.351
Someone drowns a family
on your turf...

16:31.560 --> 16:34.028
...snatches a kid
and you don't know nothing about it?

16:34.240 --> 16:37.550
If they minding their own business,
we cool. We chilling, not killing.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.268
Right, right,
because you're all about using...

16:40.480 --> 16:43.552
...your drug-dealing skills
to get free checking.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.678
Excuse me.
Can I help you with something?

16:46.880 --> 16:49.269
Antwon Mitchell.

16:50.640 --> 16:53.200
- Do I know you?
- I know your mugshot.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.192
I worked with Rich Nelson.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.759
How's he doing?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.959
Passed three years ago. Cancer.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.276
Damn, cancer's rough.

17:02.480 --> 17:06.155
But he was always talking about
how he was gonna piss on my grave.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.032
Guess I gotta grab me a 40
and go pay my respects.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.674
Somebody drowned a family
at the Pavo Real...

17:12.880 --> 17:14.996
...snatched their 3 year-old boy.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.796
- Nobody here would do that.
- That motel is a One-Niner cesspool.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.196
These million men,
they're One-Niners.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.277
Do the math.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.391
We're here just enjoying a cookout.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.909
Bullshit. It's a gang council.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.958
I'm sure that hanging with
known bangers violates your parole.

17:33.160 --> 17:36.470
Probation ended four months ago.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.716
I ain't the system's slave no more.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.036
Well, I hear you haven't
exactly retired.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.674
Dealing again, Antwon?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.835
Just trying to keep them
from making my mistakes.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.878
Lesson number one,
never piss off the PD.

17:51.080 --> 17:53.753
We're gonna take a little ride.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.188
Why'd I do that?

17:55.400 --> 17:57.834
Because you ain't fighting
the power no more.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.318
Some of my boys will have to escort.

18:09.400 --> 18:13.473
This is the city that plants evidence
on innocent brothers.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.240
Shoots us in the back,
says we were resisting.

18:16.480 --> 18:19.870
Takes us to their police house
and sticks a plunger in our ass.

18:20.080 --> 18:23.470
- Actually, that one was New York.
- It's all-white America, lady.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.240
The father visited an all-night gym
at 2 a. m. last night.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.873
Stashed 35 grand in a locker.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.271
The Venezas are 22,000 in debt
and they couldn't make the rent.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.193
To get the ransom for their boy,
they'd do whatever it took.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.391
I spoke to some
of the dead son's classmates.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.512
He's got a buddy, street name,
Chalindo, of the Coronado Boys.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.948
Real hardcore juvie record.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.310
Coronados have kidnapped
for profit in the past.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.118
Pick him up, see what he knows.

18:50.320 --> 18:53.039
Moms used to bring me
to church here as a kid.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.639
Sorry to see it's gone to shit.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.071
- Vic give you the slip?
- No, he's making a call.

18:58.280 --> 19:02.751
This is Antwon Mitchell, major O.G.
drug distributor from the early '90s.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.269
- Miguel, would you mind?
- Interrogation 1.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.948
His buddies can wait down here.

19:10.240 --> 19:13.550
- So, what's Antwon got to do with this?
- His old gang runs the Pavo Real.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.990
I didn't get the Street Crime Detail
I put in for.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.875
- Didn't know you're looking to transfer.
- Why'd you write a letter sabotaging it?

19:20.080 --> 19:22.640
I got off the phone with someone
who owes me a favour.

19:22.840 --> 19:26.435
- Buried me to the Selection Committee.
- I apprised them of your qualifications.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.677
You stabbed me in the back.
Didn't want me to find about it, right?

19:29.880 --> 19:32.030
Won't pass you
to become someone else's problem.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.390
Who's been running
your precious Garage Sting?

19:34.600 --> 19:37.114
That load of crap you sold me
for a nine minor busts?

19:37.360 --> 19:39.476
Yeah, I saw you tap dancing
on that one.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.474
So while you were out on the street,
I made Ronnie run through every bust.

19:43.680 --> 19:46.319
- And it didn't take long.
- So, what is this? Payback?

19:46.560 --> 19:49.597
Consider it the bill due. You ran
the Strike Team into the ground.

19:49.800 --> 19:52.678
To get you under control,
I parked you in front of videotapes...

19:52.880 --> 19:54.552
...and you even managed
to botch that.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.193
You are a joke.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.674
A joke? Come on.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.592
- Get off me!
- Hey, come on. Hey.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.876
Get off me!

20:09.920 --> 20:13.151
You really thought after everything,
I wouldn't get the last word?

20:30.360 --> 20:35.275
- One happy family, huh?
- Oh, yeah. You hit the jackpot.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.312
You expect me to buy you hung up
your colours to preach the peace?

20:43.520 --> 20:45.078
I gotta claim O.G.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.550
That's what keeps me real
with the little homeys.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.876
I play my strengths.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.877
Well, don't play me.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.038
Dealing, pimping, running numbers.

20:55.280 --> 20:57.635
Why is everybody whispering
this flows up to you?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.159
People talk, man.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.674
That don't make it the truth.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.916
I was planning on warning you
about Mackey.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.074
It took me a while to learn
how to get him under control.

21:06.280 --> 21:09.477
Didn't look like anyone
was in control downstairs.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.830
There's some things you need
to know about Vic.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.235
Yeah, I read your letter.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.954
If it's true, you had opportunities
to get rid of him.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.792
But in three years, you haven't.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.996
Why not?

21:23.240 --> 21:24.673
Is he too effective?

21:24.920 --> 21:26.319
...kid is a waste of time.

21:26.560 --> 21:28.869
Someone's got the kid.
You can tell us who.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.958
Or should I take a closer look
into how you plan on financing...

21:32.160 --> 21:33.912
...all these new banks
and restaurants?

21:34.160 --> 21:36.628
Didn't you hear
what that cop lady said?

21:36.840 --> 21:41.356
I sent her partner to his grave
trying to dig shit up on me.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.232
Take your shot.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.156
Maybe 13 years in Lompoc
straightened him out.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.318
Maybe he really does wanna save
Farmington one banger at a time.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.748
Lady speaks the truth.

21:57.960 --> 22:01.430
Yeah, I know Rich Nelson and his task
force had a rough time nailing you.

22:01.640 --> 22:05.679
But they did,
for a pled-down trafficking charge.

22:05.880 --> 22:09.475
Not for that crack house shootout on
Olympic. You remember, three dead?

22:09.680 --> 22:11.875
Couldn't get you for that knife
in the cop's leg.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.553
Nelson came after me nine times.

22:13.760 --> 22:17.036
And finally trumped up that charge.
Took 13 years of my life.

22:17.280 --> 22:21.671
If whoever took that kid turns out
to be a One-Niner, you'll do more.

22:22.240 --> 22:26.233
Make us come after you,
we'll get you.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.268
Respect.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.554
The drowned son was tight
with Chalindo Gopez, 17.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.911
Did nine months in one of our juvie
camps for robbery. No kidnapping.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.917
- Where is he?
- We lost him two weeks ago.

22:47.120 --> 22:48.792
So he could be involved?

22:49.000 --> 22:51.070
I'll talk to his mom,
see if she knows where he's at.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.636
- I'm happy to pick her up for you.
- Thanks, but we better handle this.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.996
- So, what are you guys thinking?
- Maybe the family sold the boy for sex.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.431
- No shit? Why?
- Because that's how Dutch thinks.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.437
No. Because that's how the world is.

23:06.560 --> 23:08.357
How's the Youth Authority
treating you?

23:08.560 --> 23:10.073
It's pretty cool. Lots of kids.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.274
We'll follow up on this. Thanks.

23:14.480 --> 23:17.711
Yeah, okay. Later.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.552
Hello?

23:29.160 --> 23:31.435
Oh, I'm sorry. I was looking for-

23:31.640 --> 23:34.234
Vic? He's on a case. Gardocki too.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.311
All right.
Just tell them Lem stopped by.

23:36.560 --> 23:40.269
Lemansky? From the Strike Team?

23:40.520 --> 23:41.839
Yeah.

23:42.040 --> 23:44.600
I'm the new captain. Monica Rawling.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.189
Oh, it's good to meet you.
How are you?

23:47.400 --> 23:51.029
I read your personnel package.
I'm sorry to have lost you.

23:51.240 --> 23:54.198
Yeah, well, you know,
I needed a change.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.674
Problems with the team?

23:55.920 --> 23:58.992
Sounds like Vic can be
a little rough to work with.

24:00.840 --> 24:04.992
No, no, Vic was always great.
It was...

24:05.640 --> 24:09.633
You know, just time. Just time.

24:10.440 --> 24:13.910
- I gotta go. It was good meeting you.
- Yeah.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.030
I haven't seen Chalindo in weeks.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.912
He may know who drowned
that family.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.752
He might lead us to the missing boy.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.871
You have any idea
where he is right now?

24:25.080 --> 24:28.231
I couldn't have been a better mom.
You know the things I did for him?

24:28.440 --> 24:30.635
- Ma'am, this isn't about you.
- It's about my boy.

24:30.840 --> 24:33.400
Why else would I be here?
I see you looking at me.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.393
- No one's accusing you.
- You shouldn't be. It's not my fault.

24:36.640 --> 24:39.438
That boy just did whatever.
You try stopping him every night.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.631
I tried more than any mom I know.
Any mom.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.116
Well, yes. I can see that.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.716
Looks like Lompoc.

24:58.920 --> 25:02.595
Tell you what, for Christmas, I'll throw
a couple of bars on the window.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.274
Thirteen years, you learn
what you can live without.

25:05.480 --> 25:07.232
All I wanted was a view.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.271
Where's the witness?

25:10.080 --> 25:12.230
Stop asking around about me, man.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.000
If there's something you wanna know,
come straight at me.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.839
- You even have a witness?
- Elena!

25:21.920 --> 25:24.150
Elena, she mops up at the motel.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.956
Said she saw two dudes, Latino,
leaving that room with that kid.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.117
Those cholos took him screaming
and crying.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.548
They got in a blue Honda.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.320
I got some of the licence plate,
I didn't see the rest.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.353
And you didn't say anything
to the detective on scene?

25:40.960 --> 25:43.554
Once I offered her protection,
she agreed to come forward.

25:43.760 --> 25:47.230
Tell me. What kind of protection can
an ex-con motivational speaker offer?

25:47.440 --> 25:50.034
Hey, man, you asked for a favour
and I gave it to you.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.435
Now, maybe one day,
you'll give me one.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.915
I doubt it.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.873
I gotta run a partial. Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:04.312
Billings tells me he found a loan shark
who spotted the drowned dad 35 grand.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.750
He was bound to find trouble
one way or another.

26:06.960 --> 26:10.157
- What are you working?
- Coronado Boys.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.072
A gang in the loosest sense.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.431
I'm trying to make ties
to find Chalindo Gopez...

26:15.680 --> 26:17.557
...the supposed friend
of the drowned boy.

26:17.760 --> 26:20.752
All these should be in a database
or at least on a wall somewhere.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.871
The Barn's an apt name.
We're low-tech.

26:23.080 --> 26:26.755
When Mackey ran point on gangs, how
did he organise his intel for everyone?

26:27.000 --> 26:29.195
Organization's not one
of Vic's strong suits.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.476
What is?

26:32.760 --> 26:35.877
I'll let you do your own evaluations.

26:37.440 --> 26:39.874
I know you were on track
to be captain here.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.559
Yes, I was.

26:41.760 --> 26:45.116
Whoever cost you that job,
it wasn't me.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.515
I'll remember that.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.828
What do you plan on doing
to square things with the DA?

26:52.040 --> 26:54.600
What are they planning on doing
to square things with me?

26:54.800 --> 26:57.758
Seventeen cases overturned,
another 40 on appeal.

26:57.960 --> 27:00.428
They have a right to be pissed.

27:02.040 --> 27:05.715
Aceveda could've fought for me.
So could you.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.520
You've made your point.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.557
Might be time to move on.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.917
Claudette, Vic's got a location
on a suspect.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.432
Clear!

27:20.640 --> 27:22.517
Clear!

27:24.000 --> 27:25.718
Left!

27:26.440 --> 27:27.668
Clear.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.838
Hey.

27:30.760 --> 27:33.832
Hey, buddy.
Don't be scared, it's okay.

27:34.040 --> 27:36.554
- Don't be scared.
- Hey, Eddie.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.115
- Hi, Eddie. Come on.
- It's okay, it's okay.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.788
- It's gonna be okay.
- Come on. No one's gonna hurt you.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.514
Come with us. I know.

27:44.760 --> 27:49.231
I know. Let's take you off this.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.472
Come on. Good boy.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.430
That's all right.

28:07.680 --> 28:09.830
They've taken the boy
to Mission Cross Hospital.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.439
I'll call my friend there.
She'll take care of him.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.676
What about finding the suspect,
Fernando Cruz?

28:13.880 --> 28:15.108
I got his cell phone number.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.392
If we get a warrant, the phone carrier
can triangulate his position.

28:18.600 --> 28:22.354
- Grab who you need, pick him up.
- Good work, Vic.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.714
Those are both the suspects.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.228
Pick them up.

28:32.440 --> 28:33.953
Let's go.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.032
Hey. Rabbit.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.800
Suspects bailed.
Detectives in foot pursuit.

28:46.720 --> 28:48.472
Go, go!

28:49.160 --> 28:51.435
Hands! Let me see your hands!

28:53.000 --> 28:55.070
- Go!
- Get down!

28:55.960 --> 28:58.428
Hey, you go straight.
You go straight.

29:07.080 --> 29:10.356
Stay down! Hands behind your back.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.951
Don't move.

29:17.040 --> 29:19.315
All right, sir,
your ambulance is here.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.033
I thought I said no hospital.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.430
But you've been shot.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.676
See that exit wound?

29:25.880 --> 29:27.916
- I have no insurance.
- The city will cover it.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.714
They'll cover it until they send
me the bill and hound me.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.194
Just ask my cousin.

29:32.400 --> 29:35.631
Hey, look, you need medical attention,
all right? It's not an option.

29:36.880 --> 29:39.917
Sir, please, look, who shot you?

29:40.120 --> 29:42.554
I don't know, man. It was a drive-by.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.877
Dispatch wants us to hang here
until the detectives arrive.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.799
A hundred witnesses, no eyes.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.798
You blame them?
Guy got shot cleaning his yard.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.837
What do you think
they'd do to someone...

29:54.040 --> 29:55.712
...willing to testify in open court?

30:01.040 --> 30:03.076
Oh, sit down.

30:03.280 --> 30:07.831
You know, when the assistant chief
gave me the rundown on this place...

30:08.640 --> 30:09.868
...your name came up.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.878
Well, the DA's got a hard-on
for my partner.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.514
Claudette seems dug in.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.028
That's because she's right.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.755
Whether she's right or not,
she's gonna drag you down with her.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.718
Hey.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.148
Congratulations in order?

30:32.360 --> 30:34.749
One guy has aggravated assault.
I bet he's the killer.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.713
The other a few misdemeanours,
he's probably just a puppy.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.230
You know,
it's really not my business...

30:41.440 --> 30:44.716
...but could you give the puppy
to Wagenbach and Wyms?

30:44.920 --> 30:47.309
Well, he'll probably break first.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.352
But they could use the win.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.278
It's really not my place.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.193
I can tell you're not the sort.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.628
What sort?

30:57.840 --> 31:00.400
The sort that would parade
a family down to a bathroom...

31:00.600 --> 31:02.079
...and drown them one by one.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.430
Each one coming in...

31:04.640 --> 31:09.509
...seeing their mother,
father, sister, lying there.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.990
Knowing they're gonna be next.

31:14.720 --> 31:16.870
It must have been terrible, huh?

31:28.360 --> 31:30.510
Your boy Fernando's
on the verge of collapse.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.756
Good.
Because this little prick ain't talking.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.871
Last chance to cut yourself
a decent deal.

31:36.440 --> 31:40.069
Drowned four people but you let the
boy live. That'll count for something.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.714
Now, I know you're talking bullshit.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.912
Your buddy's about to crack.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.956
Just a matter of time before he helps
himself and hangs you out to dry.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.675
He's acting like he thinks
the little kid's dead. Now, why is that?

32:00.160 --> 32:01.798
I couldn't do it.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.514
- Killing a little kid.
- But you could drown four people?

32:04.720 --> 32:07.393
Tito held Pops' head underwater
to get him to talk.

32:07.600 --> 32:11.036
But the old man died.
Tito said we had to do the others too.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.949
- What was Pops supposed to say?
- Where the 35 grand was.

32:15.160 --> 32:17.913
What was he doing with that much cash
in the first place?

32:20.200 --> 32:21.679
He thought he was buying la cura.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.154
The cure? Heroin?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.635
Chalindo convinced the son
to set it up.

32:25.840 --> 32:29.150
We sell to Pops, he turns it around,
sells it for five times the money.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.998
Maybe buys the family a house.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.316
So, what went wrong?

32:34.120 --> 32:37.271
There was no H.
Plan was just a rip-off.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.950
So the son set up his own father
to be robbed? Beautiful.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.037
Pops should have just handed
over the cash.

32:43.240 --> 32:44.673
So why'd you take the kid?

32:44.880 --> 32:48.395
After the others,
I couldn't let Tito do him. A little kid?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.717
- Tito said he could ID us to the cops.
- He's 3 years old.

32:51.960 --> 32:53.188
It talks, right?

32:53.400 --> 32:57.916
Tito wanted to put a body on my hands,
so he told me to do him. But I couldn't.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.877
So I hid him at my place,
told him I did the killing.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.031
This is all gonna help me, right?

33:04.280 --> 33:06.635
I didn't drown anyone myself
and I saved the kid.

33:06.840 --> 33:09.035
That's all good, right?

33:19.560 --> 33:25.078
Dead-Eye, I'm here to talk
about a friend of ours, Antwon Mitchell.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.879
Let's talk inside.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.998
I'm either gonna tell you to blow me
or you're gonna tune me up.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.350
Either way,
my boys can know the score.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.639
I hear you got booted off
your corner.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.513
I'm branching out,
onward and upward.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.793
Yeah, right. What's the matter,
a little dispute with the management?

33:46.040 --> 33:47.598
I can relate.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.279
It's all good.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.074
You got mouths to feed.
How you planning on making coin?

33:52.280 --> 33:53.793
I'm resourceful.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.592
Antwon Mitchell has it in for you...

33:55.800 --> 33:58.553
...you might as well find
a corner in Miami.

33:58.760 --> 34:00.557
How long you think
he'll let you play...

34:00.760 --> 34:03.069
...before he sends some smoker
to whack you?

34:03.320 --> 34:06.073
- What do you want?
- We could set you up.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.077
Police?

34:09.199 --> 34:12.431
- Man, you can't afford me.
- Try me.

34:18.280 --> 34:20.635
Boys, inside.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.190
Daddy's talking business.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.279
You bring me a number.

34:31.520 --> 34:34.478
- And you give me Antwon?
- That depends on the number.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.358
Hey, fellas, come here.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.672
You see who shot the man
over there?

34:44.880 --> 34:46.108
Sure did.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.676
- Yeah? What'd he look like?
- Some white dude in a limo.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.195
I saw him too.
It was the governor or something.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.714
Shot him up Terminator-style.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.480
What do you think they looked like?
Some niggas in a car.

34:56.679 --> 35:00.559
- You kiss your mother with that mouth?
- No, I kiss your mother with this mouth.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.597
Think it's funny throwing away
your lives?

35:03.800 --> 35:06.268
Wanna see what it looks like down
in juvenile detention?

35:07.240 --> 35:10.073
Look out. Here comes the beat down.

35:10.280 --> 35:12.077
Search a nigga down
And grabbing his nuts

35:12.280 --> 35:15.352
But on the other hand
Without a gun, they can't get none

35:15.560 --> 35:18.358
But don't let it be a black
And a white one

35:19.040 --> 35:19.995
Get out of here.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.633
They slam you down to the street top

35:21.840 --> 35:24.035
Black police showing out
For the white cop

35:24.280 --> 35:25.508
Show some respect.

35:25.720 --> 35:28.188
- Respect!
- You heard me, go.

35:31.680 --> 35:34.513
Why you let them
give you all that shit?

35:35.120 --> 35:37.315
Jesus said,
"Suffer the little children unto me. "

35:37.520 --> 35:40.512
Yeah, that doesn't that mean
we have to suffer too.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.713
You get anything new on tape?

35:44.920 --> 35:47.832
Yup. Mike Winston.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.271
We finally nail him shaking down
those storeowners?

35:51.520 --> 35:53.636
Not exactly a storeowner.

35:54.600 --> 35:58.149
Son looks about 12.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.950
Now, here comes Winston.

36:08.200 --> 36:10.714
- What did I tell you?
- I didn't.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.276
I saw you. Stop lying.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.518
- I didn't.
- Yes, you-

36:16.720 --> 36:19.109
Dad, stop it.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.151
- I didn't do it.
- Yes, you did!

36:22.640 --> 36:24.596
Stop it! I won't do it again.

36:24.800 --> 36:28.793
Mom's got a psych history
so she's out of the picture on a 51-50.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.992
And running in Winston blows
our surveillance cover on him...

36:32.200 --> 36:34.509
...maybe everyone else.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.836
- Yup.
- Shut up!

36:37.040 --> 36:39.315
See what you made me do?

36:40.280 --> 36:41.713
Stop your whining.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.393
Let me see your liquor licence.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.158
Something wrong?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.718
Nope.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.718
No, it looks good.
Now, give me a beer.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.878
It's on the house.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.550
Long day. Appreciate it.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.274
Hey, buddy, you're in my seat.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.600
That's my drink. My smokes.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.989
Smoke them somewhere else.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.433
- Trying to be an asshole?
- No, I'm just looking at one.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.632
You saving this seat
for your boyfriend?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.711
Mike, he's a cop.

37:25.920 --> 37:28.673
Back up. It's okay. We're the police.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.275
Back up, back up.

37:49.680 --> 37:51.238
Okay, keep this on until you leave.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.793
- I'm not leaving now?
- Not yet.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.070
I've got that realtor's agreement
in my locker.

37:55.280 --> 37:57.032
Told you I'd stop by.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.477
- You sure we're doing the right thing?
- Prices are up right now.

38:00.720 --> 38:04.269
We're gonna bank that money, send
the kids to your mom's school district.

38:04.480 --> 38:08.439
I know. Yeah, it's just a house.

38:08.640 --> 38:10.596
Go get the papers.
I'll sign them right now.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.552
Okay.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.590
You really did a number on Winston.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.075
You gonna shed a tear
for that kid-beating asshole?

38:21.280 --> 38:23.191
No, anyway Junior
doesn't have to worry.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.277
He's got grandparents in Simi Valley.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.232
I thought they were gonna fix
your face?

38:28.480 --> 38:30.789
They're gonna have to fix yours
in a minute.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.394
1- Tango-13, listen,
we've been out here all day.

38:42.600 --> 38:44.989
You got an ETA on those detectives?

38:45.200 --> 38:48.112
1- Tango-13, you should have
come in at 1900 hours.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.390
1- Tango-7 needs the car.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.513
Are they serious?

38:52.720 --> 38:55.951
If a guy gets shot in the ghetto
but the detectives never show up...

38:56.160 --> 38:58.799
...did the crime really happen?

38:59.000 --> 39:02.436
Come on. 1-Tango-7 needs the car.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.037
Yeah.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.872
That was quite a day yesterday.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.829
Quite a night too, I see.

39:19.040 --> 39:21.554
Got another big one planned
for tonight.

39:22.120 --> 39:26.238
One of Antwon Mitchell's pawns seems
to be willing to roll over on the king.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.796
I got a Cl contract snaking
its way through the system.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.678
Who'd you mix it up with?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.950
Just some drunk looking
to pick a fight.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.232
What kind of future are we gonna have
if you're already lying to me?

39:38.480 --> 39:39.708
What are you talking about?

39:39.920 --> 39:42.275
That drunk you put in the hospital
is Mike Winston...

39:42.480 --> 39:44.232
...an extortionist
in your Garage Sting.

39:44.440 --> 39:47.910
- I mean, that's quite a coincidence.
- He was smoking in a public place.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.637
Wait a second.

39:55.880 --> 39:58.553
We caught the prick on tape
whacking his kid.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.239
This seemed like a regular thing.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.637
Couldn't make a case against him
without jeopardising the Garage Sting.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.353
So you beat the shit out of him?

40:05.600 --> 40:08.194
I gave him the chance to take
the first shot. He did.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.635
I got him on assault,
which violates his parole...

40:10.840 --> 40:12.432
...sends him back
minimum one year...

40:12.640 --> 40:14.676
...gets his son away,
back to his grandparents.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.279
- Well, that's smart.
- Thank you.

40:16.480 --> 40:18.072
Pretty stupid too.

40:21.440 --> 40:23.829
You were all fired up
about those motel murders...

40:24.040 --> 40:26.838
...before you knew a boy
was missing.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.268
Why?

40:33.240 --> 40:35.800
Look, when I had the Strike Team...

40:36.000 --> 40:39.072
...we were setting up to close
that joint down.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.514
Then, other things got in the way.

40:43.720 --> 40:47.235
You're dedicated,
you know the streets.

40:47.920 --> 40:50.593
But you also accessed
a confidential letter...

40:51.360 --> 40:56.832
...went after your CO,
topped it off with a bar brawl chaser.

40:57.040 --> 40:59.190
Seems to me like you're looking
for a way out.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.668
I don't want out.

41:00.880 --> 41:03.758
Aceveda's letter means
that no other unit's gonna hire you.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.430
I'm stuck with you.

41:07.360 --> 41:10.318
I was thinking of putting you back
into play, but now...

41:13.760 --> 41:16.433
I'm starting a task force
to target gangs.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.959
Unis, detectives.

41:18.160 --> 41:20.310
Study their turf, ink,
chains of command.

41:20.520 --> 41:22.795
We crack down,
improve life for everyone else.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.436
Good luck. The department wouldn't
fund another guy for the Strike Team.

41:26.680 --> 41:29.274
It's gonna be funded
through a forfeiture programme.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.474
You're seizing property?

41:31.680 --> 41:35.673
Houses, cars, businesses,
anything bought with drug money.

41:35.880 --> 41:39.316
Some cash comes to us,
some to the DA.

41:39.520 --> 41:43.559
What sold the chief is putting a third
back into neighbourhood programmes.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.035
I need someone to spearhead the plan
on the street.

41:46.240 --> 41:50.199
Someone who won't lose control.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.635
Someone who can make it work
without embarrassing me.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.592
I want it.

41:56.920 --> 42:00.356
People out there think that
Antwon Mitchell's an actual option...

42:00.600 --> 42:02.750
...because we haven't given him
any competition.

42:02.960 --> 42:07.476
I believe in offering people a hand
even if they do slap it away.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.315
I said I want the job.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.551
I need to trust you. Right now...

42:18.960 --> 42:20.951
...I don't.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.073
You have a week to get your shit
together. Show me something.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.793
They're pointing the finger
at each other. We got them both.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.958
- Find the friend who set it up?
- Chalindo? Looks like he skipped.

42:41.160 --> 42:44.118
- Mom of the year tipped him off.
- Juvie's tracking him now.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.749
- Excuse me.
- Good work catching these guys.

42:46.960 --> 42:50.316
Actually, I couldn't have done it
without Wagenbach and Wyms.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.431
Well, you're the primary.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.268
Glad to know getting a confession,
finding the money...

42:59.480 --> 43:01.789
...had nothing to do
with solving this case.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.956
I guess it's just you and me.

43:06.840 --> 43:08.068
This is couples counselling.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.430
- I can't do it myself.
- Lower your voice.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.831
What is it?
You don't like this doctor either?

43:14.040 --> 43:16.270
- I'm trying.
- You say that but you're not.

43:16.960 --> 43:19.713
Not at home. Not in Hawaii.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.116
I'm sorry your therapy's
not working for me.

43:23.320 --> 43:26.869
You've given up.
You need to get past it.

43:27.080 --> 43:29.514
I'm tired of feeling
like I was raped too.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.557
If I'm not good enough for you,
go find someone else.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.796
We should just end this,
say it isn't working.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.356
A divorce?
I'm not even gonna listen to this.

43:40.440 --> 43:43.318
Whatever it is you need to do
to help yourself...

43:44.080 --> 43:46.116
...do it already.

43:52.320 --> 43:54.072
Dead-Eye's two boys
are in with the mom.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.840
- We'll bring them in later.
- I'll round up a couple cots.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.395
God, I hope this guy's not boning us.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.032
Shit. We got a problem.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.358
Freeze! Police!

44:16.560 --> 44:18.039
Come out!

44:18.280 --> 44:19.508
Come out right now!

44:19.760 --> 44:21.512
Shane?

44:27.960 --> 44:30.190
What the hell are you doing here?

44:30.440 --> 44:31.873
I got a call about a shooting.

44:32.120 --> 44:34.236
- What are you doing?
- We didn't hear any call.

44:34.440 --> 44:36.192
One of my Cl's phoned in a tip.

44:38.160 --> 44:40.230
Where's your backup?

44:41.360 --> 44:42.998
I'm solo tonight.

44:43.200 --> 44:45.555
Well, did you call it in?

44:45.760 --> 44:47.159
I was about to.

44:50.520 --> 44:53.478
What's your Vice Unit
have to do with this guy?

44:53.680 --> 44:55.477
Dead-Eye had a lot of vices.

44:57.400 --> 44:59.356
Watch the door.

45:02.040 --> 45:03.871
So how you doing?

45:04.080 --> 45:05.957
Kids all right? Is...?

45:06.160 --> 45:08.469
Is Cassidy still with you?

45:10.560 --> 45:12.198
Yeah.

45:16.160 --> 45:18.958
I heard you and Mara had the baby.

45:19.160 --> 45:22.152
Yeah. Yeah, three...

45:22.360 --> 45:23.759
Three weeks ago.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.752
Named him Jackson.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.956
As in Michael?

45:29.960 --> 45:31.951
As in Stonewall.

45:33.920 --> 45:35.672
Congrats.

45:39.000 --> 45:43.949
So I heard about Reyes taking
the Street Crime Detail.

45:44.160 --> 45:47.232
Guess you'll be stuck
on videotapes for a while, huh?

45:47.440 --> 45:52.036
I worked the drowning, the hotel,
yesterday at the Pavo Real.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.352
Yeah, the place always was a pit.

45:54.560 --> 45:57.996
Yeah, a pit we were about
to pull the plug on.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.670
Except we were too busy
covering our asses.

46:01.880 --> 46:04.952
Yeah. Well, too many dickheads,
too little time.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.954
- What are you doing?
- Taking his blackberry.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.435
I had dealings with this guy.
You know how that is.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.596
No, I don't. Put it back.

46:15.320 --> 46:17.311
I can't do that.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.750
My name's in there.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.238
What about Antwon Mitchell's?

46:24.120 --> 46:26.475
What are you, IAD now?

46:26.680 --> 46:28.750
I don't see that jacket fitting.

46:30.840 --> 46:34.310
Why are you here? Who did this?

46:36.760 --> 46:38.910
You wanna smell my gun?

46:41.080 --> 46:42.479
Antwon Mitchell do this?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.797
You know, I honestly don't know.

46:47.400 --> 46:50.073
But I'll tell you what,
I'll let you call it in.
