WEBVTT

00:10.985 --> 00:12.650
<i>Brock! Brock! Brock!</i>

00:12.718 --> 00:16.974
<i>Brock! Brock! Brock!...</i>

00:17.090 --> 00:19.161
Hey, all right!

00:19.764 --> 00:21.224
All right.
That's very nice.

00:21.478 --> 00:25.514
My God, look at this sea
of Millennial faces. I am...

00:25.731 --> 00:27.818
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:27.933 --> 00:29.445
I'm terrified.

00:29.582 --> 00:30.901
Let's get right into it.

00:31.001 --> 00:33.862
I need a suggestion
for a monologue.

00:34.402 --> 00:37.748
- The one that got away!
- The one that got at away.

00:37.818 --> 00:39.567
My God!

00:43.889 --> 00:45.051
Ooh!

00:46.635 --> 00:50.014
Wow. You people
aren't kidding around tonight.

00:50.205 --> 00:52.407
So much has gotten away
from me lately.

00:52.475 --> 00:55.427
I mean, friends, family...
My father.

00:55.628 --> 00:58.429
Um, hard to narrow it down
to just one thing.

01:00.637 --> 01:01.899
Folks, you ever have something

01:01.976 --> 01:04.474
so pure, just so real...

01:05.069 --> 01:07.302
you almost felt like
you didn't even deserve it?

01:07.540 --> 01:09.258
- Can you relate to that?
- Yeah.

01:09.381 --> 01:12.233
For me,
that one thing...

01:12.610 --> 01:14.255
was Molly Malone.

01:17.015 --> 01:19.575
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:19.737 --> 01:21.492
Molly Malone
is a street name

01:21.560 --> 01:23.794
for the purest
MDMA in existence.

01:31.112 --> 01:32.472
Yeah?

01:34.069 --> 01:35.381
Hi.

01:35.836 --> 01:37.374
Hi!

01:38.203 --> 01:40.775
You know, I didn't
expect to see you here.

01:40.947 --> 01:43.549
Or ever again,
really.

01:43.747 --> 01:45.447
I thought it'd be creepy
if I saw your show

01:45.515 --> 01:47.488
and then didn't come
say "hi" afterwards.

01:49.358 --> 01:51.541
Right now, "creepy" doesn't
seem like such a bad thing.

01:51.609 --> 01:53.234
No, wait, whoa! Oh.
What are you do...

01:53.388 --> 01:54.771
Why are you
in New Orleans?

01:54.959 --> 01:56.817
I have a layover.
I'm on my way to Colombia.

01:56.919 --> 01:58.853
I've been approached about
buying an ownership piece

01:58.920 --> 02:00.244
of a winter ball team
down there.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.283
My flight leaves at midnight.
Midnight!

02:02.351 --> 02:04.102
Well, that's practically
tomorrow, isn't it?

02:04.170 --> 02:06.063
Come on, can...
Let's grab a drink.

02:06.170 --> 02:07.970
- That's not a good idea.
- All right.

02:08.103 --> 02:10.020
Got other plans, huh?
I do.

02:10.196 --> 02:12.647
The in-flight magazine said
that I can't leave New Orleans

02:12.715 --> 02:14.779
without getting a beignet from
Cafe Du Monde.

02:14.847 --> 02:17.568
Du Monde?! No, that's overpriced
and overcrowded, Jules.

02:17.636 --> 02:19.027
I know
where the locals go.

02:19.160 --> 02:21.405
Come on. Please.
It'll be my treat.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.305
Don't you have
an after-party to go to?

02:23.373 --> 02:25.394
After-party?
No, I don't.

02:25.542 --> 02:29.138
What, my life just seems like one big
party to you, huh, from the outside?

02:29.206 --> 02:32.276
I assure you, it's, uh...
It's very lonely, Jules.

02:32.531 --> 02:33.874
So, we fucking?

02:34.081 --> 02:36.348
That was unfortunate timing
right there.

02:36.416 --> 02:38.743
So, I'm gonna say goodbye.
Fine. Let's go.

02:39.164 --> 02:41.834
Really? Don't give me
time to change my mind.

02:42.303 --> 02:44.977
- Um, hello?
- He'll fuck you tomorrow.

02:45.187 --> 02:47.894
<font color=#FF00FF>*BROCKMIRE*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02  Episode 05</font>
Episode Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"Make-up the Game"</font>

02:48.869 --> 02:50.634
So, Jules, can I ask
what you're doing here?

02:50.702 --> 02:51.950
I told you.
I have a layover.

02:52.017 --> 02:53.809
No, I mean
what are <i> we</i> doing here?

02:55.562 --> 02:57.485
Okay, can I tell you
why <i> I'm</i> here?

02:57.816 --> 03:00.300
Because I am desperate
to absorb any moment

03:00.368 --> 03:01.727
I can possibly get
with you,

03:01.829 --> 03:03.897
no matter how awkward
it might be.

03:04.091 --> 03:05.964
Kind of like the way
Johnny The Hat would wring

03:06.032 --> 03:08.480
the bar mat into his mouth
after last call.

03:08.695 --> 03:09.703
You... remember that?

03:09.771 --> 03:12.555
The saddest part was he'd always
leave me a tip afterwards.

03:13.089 --> 03:15.599
Just be honest with me.
Please.

03:18.937 --> 03:22.263
Okay, fine. I set up a Google
Alert for "Jim Brockmire dead."

03:22.514 --> 03:24.452
Jesus Christ. Everybody I know
has one of those things.

03:24.519 --> 03:25.969
So, when I got the e-mail
with that headline,

03:26.036 --> 03:28.148
I felt terrible...
Worse than when my dad died,

03:28.216 --> 03:29.857
'cause the last thing I said
to him was "I love you."

03:29.924 --> 03:31.723
Last thing
I said to you...

03:32.050 --> 03:33.624
I don't remember exactly
what it I was, but it...

03:33.691 --> 03:36.165
You said, "Back up," and then
you slammed the door in my face.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.027
Yeah.
So, for a second,

03:38.095 --> 03:41.345
I thought that was
our last moment together.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.355
And I knew I had
to tell you something.

03:45.956 --> 03:47.146
I don't hate you.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.662
Boy, this is
a real roller coaster.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.743
You're selfish,
and you did a selfish thing.

03:50.811 --> 03:53.826
I can hate the way you did it,
but I knew who you were.

03:54.812 --> 03:57.663
Okay. I mean,
that's progress, I guess.

03:57.743 --> 03:59.974
I mean, at least I am not
dead to you anymore.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.675
Life is too short to hold
that kind of grudge.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.874
Just ask these two.
Oh, yeah.

04:05.951 --> 04:09.970
You know why all the cemeteries
in New Orleans are above ground?

04:10.355 --> 04:12.115
'Cause we're below
sea level here.

04:12.425 --> 04:14.134
If they actually
buried their dead,

04:14.202 --> 04:17.136
they'd find themselves
swimming in a river of corpses.

04:17.305 --> 04:22.007
These monuments, they all house actual
bones and... and rotting flesh.

04:22.301 --> 04:24.961
So, if I don't ask
for macabre New Orleans trivia,

04:25.046 --> 04:26.750
just assume I don't want to
hear it, okay?

04:26.818 --> 04:28.336
- Just trying to be a good tour guide.
- Yeah, well...

04:28.403 --> 04:29.848
Seriously. No,
speaking of which,

04:29.925 --> 04:32.451
right down that road there
lies the bar

04:32.528 --> 04:35.124
that invented
the French 75.

04:36.358 --> 04:38.524
Well, I think of you
every time I go in there.

04:38.601 --> 04:41.100
I do, because for some
ridiculous reason, Jules,

04:41.168 --> 04:42.618
that's your
favorite drink.

04:42.686 --> 04:45.159
Because it's like a white wine
spritzer without the shame.

04:45.238 --> 04:47.383
Oh, God,
there's so much shame.

04:49.676 --> 04:51.534
- We have a new mascot.
- Ah.

04:51.635 --> 04:53.836
It's an oil derrick now.
Derek the Derrick.

04:53.911 --> 04:56.616
Mm. Boy, you anthropomorphized
the very thing

04:56.684 --> 04:58.302
that will be the undoing
of the human race.

04:58.408 --> 05:00.646
That's...
That's a very nice touch.

05:00.714 --> 05:01.978
I thought so.

05:02.216 --> 05:05.142
And I started a "When Harry
Met Sally" promo night...

05:05.219 --> 05:07.310
Two-for-one drinks
if you fake an orgasm

05:07.378 --> 05:08.658
- at the concession stand.
- Wow.

05:08.783 --> 05:11.485
It's the "I'll have
what she's having."

05:11.891 --> 05:14.283
Nice, but I'm kind of glad
I missed that one.

05:14.495 --> 05:16.784
Not sure I could have
handled seeing Dale

05:16.872 --> 05:18.572
in the throes
of pleasure like that.

05:18.891 --> 05:20.541
- Dale died.
- What?

05:20.634 --> 05:22.559
- Yeah.
- Get out of here.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.292
How'd he die? He was so young.
Meth fire.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.195
Meth... Yeah, well,
makes sense, doesn't it?

05:27.263 --> 05:29.032
You know,
I-I told him.

05:29.109 --> 05:31.415
I said, "You can cook meth
as a hobby

05:31.483 --> 05:32.978
or you can
siphon gasoline.

05:33.055 --> 05:34.899
You cannot do both."
Yeah.

05:35.116 --> 05:37.165
- You seeing anybody?
- Nice segue.

05:37.615 --> 05:39.769
I know, I'm sorry.
I just... I-I gotta know.

05:39.837 --> 05:41.261
You know, it's all
I can think about

05:41.329 --> 05:42.932
since the moment
I saw you.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.917
I'm seeing a few people.

05:46.062 --> 05:47.717
Not as many as you,
probably.

05:47.794 --> 05:49.928
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait a minute now.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.588
At first, I, uh...

05:51.773 --> 05:54.037
dated attractive,
age-appropriate women

05:54.105 --> 05:56.420
as kind of a substitute
for you. I did.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.014
Desperately aping the magic
of our relationship

06:00.082 --> 06:02.407
like Woody Allen trying
to boil a lobster

06:02.475 --> 06:05.343
with whoever that
non-Annie-Hall-type person was.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.163
Now, I just, uh...

06:07.347 --> 06:10.406
I stick to the
one-night-stand groupie well.

06:10.483 --> 06:12.750
I mean, it's transactional,
but at least it's honest.

06:12.827 --> 06:14.418
You poor baby.

06:14.576 --> 06:16.668
So many women
jumping on your dick.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.414
It's not easy.

06:18.491 --> 06:20.491
Hey, I gotta get going.
My flight is...

06:20.568 --> 06:23.228
No, no... Hey, no. Come on.
Don't get on that plane.

06:23.355 --> 06:26.517
Seriously, just... stay.

06:28.329 --> 06:29.521
Stay for what?

06:29.633 --> 06:31.292
Jules, you haven't had a beignet yet.

06:31.515 --> 06:33.685
No, you can't visit New Orleans
and not have a beignet.

06:33.782 --> 06:35.507
That's like...
That's a slap in the face

06:35.584 --> 06:37.609
to the editors
of <i> Delta Sky Magazine.</i>

06:37.790 --> 06:40.377
Okay.
Really?

06:40.445 --> 06:41.670
Well, don't make me
overthink it.

06:41.738 --> 06:43.153
I'm pretty sure
I'm making a mistake.

06:43.273 --> 06:45.918
Well...
No, you're not.

06:45.986 --> 06:48.520
Since I'm staying,
you can buy me another drink.

06:54.742 --> 06:56.429
This one's done.

06:57.264 --> 06:59.249
I really missed you.

07:01.434 --> 07:03.944
Hey, Pasquale.
Yo, how you doing?

07:04.012 --> 07:05.852
Double for me, usual.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.214
Pint glass full
of White Zin for the lady.

07:08.282 --> 07:09.555
You heard that right.

07:11.319 --> 07:14.236
Kind of a regular here.
Don't like to brag.

07:14.348 --> 07:16.757
No, I know. You mentioned it
on your podcast.

07:16.825 --> 07:17.959
This is where you like
to take a woman

07:18.026 --> 07:19.851
when you really want
to impress her.

07:19.954 --> 07:21.811
- I did?
- I believe your exact words were

07:21.888 --> 07:23.688
"put a napkin down
or it's gonna look like

07:23.765 --> 07:26.684
there was a snail race
on that barstool."

07:26.952 --> 07:29.343
- Get out of here. I said that?
- Yeah, you did.

07:29.429 --> 07:32.289
You broadcast it to anyone who'd listen.
Oh, my goodness.

07:32.366 --> 07:34.820
Well, Ol' Blackout Jimmy is just
full of surprises, isn't he?

07:34.947 --> 07:37.035
But you know, my...
Thank you, Pasquale.

07:37.112 --> 07:39.387
My takeaway from that story
is...

07:39.581 --> 07:42.311
you're a regular listener
to my podcast.

07:42.745 --> 07:45.697
I gotta have something to do
while I'm folding the laundry.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.507
- Oh, don't we all.
- Hey, I gotta pee.

07:47.589 --> 07:49.559
Uh, I'm assuming you've had sex
in the ladies' room.

07:49.626 --> 07:51.623
- Oh, you know that I have.
- Is it gross?

07:51.725 --> 07:53.172
- No, it's not bad at all.
- Oh.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.765
Straight back
that way.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.655
- Thank you.
- Oh, sure. Enjoy.

08:01.061 --> 08:03.628
There you are. I had a
feeling I'd find you here.

08:03.696 --> 08:06.035
What are you doing here? Well,
I came down to let you know

08:06.104 --> 08:09.245
that word's coming in
from Atlanta this weekend.

08:09.344 --> 08:11.088
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

08:11.270 --> 08:13.271
This weekend's almost over, isn't it?
Exactly.

08:13.407 --> 08:16.085
And I'm pretty sure
no news is not good news.

08:16.251 --> 08:19.703
Right. Yeah, okay.
I'll see.

08:19.952 --> 08:22.398
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, Charles.

08:22.505 --> 08:24.642
You know, if Atlanta
doesn't happen, it...

08:24.849 --> 08:26.921
It wasn't meant to be.
Okay.

08:27.096 --> 08:28.296
Okay.

08:29.081 --> 08:30.142
What's going on
with you?

08:30.219 --> 08:32.730
Nothing is going on with me.
What's going on with you?

08:32.804 --> 08:35.964
- Hey! I missed you!
- Oh, my God!

08:36.032 --> 08:37.966
- I missed you so much!
- This...

08:38.173 --> 08:39.488
This is great!

08:39.565 --> 08:41.385
It's like my parents
are getting back together.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.311
Except, you know, I actually
want this to happen.

08:43.378 --> 08:45.229
- Just relax.
- Where's your girlfriend?

08:45.306 --> 08:47.375
Girlfriend? This guy
doesn't have a girlfriend!

08:47.443 --> 08:50.398
I had to bribe this guy
just to have sex with somebody.

08:51.712 --> 08:55.152
You know what it does have,
though, is someplace else to be.

08:55.220 --> 08:56.402
Right. Got it.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.082
I'll leave you two
to catch up.

08:59.224 --> 09:02.225
It's happening!
Nothing is happening!

09:02.293 --> 09:03.809
- Okay!
- Stop it.

09:03.990 --> 09:05.612
I mean, something...
Something's happening.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.814
I just don't want
to label it,

09:06.882 --> 09:09.113
because that will kill what's happening...
whatever that is.

09:09.180 --> 09:10.228
- Shut up.
- All right.

09:10.305 --> 09:11.748
Cheers.

09:14.742 --> 09:17.507
You know what... do you have...
You don't have saxophones?

09:24.678 --> 09:26.135
Whoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

09:26.212 --> 09:27.879
Is there, like,
another saxophone guy?

09:27.956 --> 09:30.181
I will take two trumpets
if that's all you got.

09:30.258 --> 09:31.616
Here. Cheers.

09:43.997 --> 09:46.155
Oh, yeah.
See, that's good.

09:46.232 --> 09:47.699
You can taste the jazz!

09:52.405 --> 09:54.880
Oh!
Oh, shit!

09:54.948 --> 09:56.081
Oh, are you
all right?

09:56.251 --> 09:58.309
- No!
- Oh, shit!

09:58.394 --> 10:00.556
God damn it! God!

10:00.691 --> 10:02.791
How's that ankle doing?
Still smarting back there?

10:02.893 --> 10:06.314
It hurts.
And my head hurts.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.854
- Oh, are you sobering up?
- No. Can't have that.

10:08.922 --> 10:10.254
We gotta get you
another drink.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.392
I used to keep up
with you.

10:13.469 --> 10:16.023
What's happened?
I... Oh!

10:16.127 --> 10:18.892
Uh, I may not be
in the major leagues,

10:19.064 --> 10:21.998
but I've really upped my game
when it comes to my alcoholism.

10:22.210 --> 10:23.593
Yeah, New Orleans
is...

10:23.670 --> 10:25.536
It's really the place
to go pro.

10:25.613 --> 10:28.814
And you know who has
an up-and-coming bar scene?

10:28.882 --> 10:30.031
Morristown.

10:30.099 --> 10:32.295
Oh, yeah,
Morristown has its charms.

10:32.363 --> 10:33.979
It does.
Mmhmm.

10:34.294 --> 10:37.691
Ooh, Jules, you know what night I
always think about? Mmm, which one?

10:37.801 --> 10:40.677
The time that we drank Sambuca...

10:40.754 --> 10:43.402
at home plate there.
Oh, babe, me, too.

10:43.490 --> 10:45.356
But this time,
can we have sex in a bed,

10:45.433 --> 10:46.958
'cause I don't want
to pick dirt

10:47.035 --> 10:48.622
out of my ass crack
for two weeks.

10:48.698 --> 10:50.973
I don't, either.
Sure thing! I'm gonna run.

10:56.425 --> 10:58.139
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait, wait.

10:59.039 --> 11:01.270
You just have this
hotel room all the time?

11:01.342 --> 11:03.250
Oh, yes, this is where
I take the strange

11:03.318 --> 11:05.235
I don't want
to bring home.

11:05.312 --> 11:08.078
Charles can be a real judgy
little prick sometimes.

11:08.146 --> 11:10.296
I see.
So, am I the strange?

11:10.400 --> 11:12.668
Oh, yes, you are. You're...
You are <i> the</i> strange.

11:12.736 --> 11:14.285
- Yes!
- Yeah, you are.

11:14.353 --> 11:15.918
Your slut.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.169
So...

11:17.458 --> 11:19.398
did you have
a-a good time tonight?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.257
Are you kidding?
I'm in love.

11:24.174 --> 11:25.840
With New Orleans.

11:26.471 --> 11:28.192
- Please!
- Ugh.

11:28.597 --> 11:30.052
No, well, I am, too.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.427
God, you terrified me
there.

11:33.103 --> 11:36.345
I mean, you know, it's nice to
finally find a home, you know,

11:36.413 --> 11:37.445
and...

11:37.513 --> 11:38.868
finally settle down.

11:38.945 --> 11:41.229
All it took was
the love of a good...

11:41.623 --> 11:42.883
city.

11:43.456 --> 11:46.509
- I don't believe in a soul.
- Okay.

11:46.577 --> 11:48.944
I think it's just a delusion
that masks the fact

11:49.073 --> 11:51.089
that we're all just
lumpy sacks of meat

11:51.166 --> 11:53.549
marching towards
our inevitable obsolescence.

11:53.618 --> 11:55.991
Can we dispense with
the graveyard

11:56.074 --> 11:57.348
- play-by-play...?
- Since I don't believe in a soul,

11:57.415 --> 11:59.429
I can't say that I believe
in a soul <i> mate,</i> Jules.

11:59.606 --> 12:00.941
But I'll tell you
something.

12:01.109 --> 12:03.544
Uh, I do know
that the connection

12:03.612 --> 12:06.594
that I feel between the two
of us... I'm serious now...

12:09.309 --> 12:11.789
It's the most profound thing
I've ever known.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.802
I just messed it up,
didn't I?

12:23.153 --> 12:24.612
- No.
- I did.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.346
No, I-I know
what you mean.

12:27.769 --> 12:29.502
Usually when someone
hurts me,

12:29.737 --> 12:32.559
I could cut them out of my life
like the tumor they are, but...

12:33.570 --> 12:36.088
oh, with you, I can't.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.211
Okay, so to me,
you're a profound love,

12:38.279 --> 12:39.852
and to you, I'm a tumor?
Yeah.

12:39.920 --> 12:43.647
You're a tumor. Tumor I like.
Like a benign one.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.270
You know what?
I'll take it.

12:47.045 --> 12:49.044
At this point,
I'll take it.

12:49.672 --> 12:52.794
Am I still the only person you've
ever had sex with on home plate?

12:52.925 --> 12:55.407
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

12:56.759 --> 12:59.556
Although Uribe and I did
jerk off on the pitcher's mound.

12:59.633 --> 13:01.151
Now you ruined it.

13:01.263 --> 13:02.615
How about that beignet?

13:02.683 --> 13:05.668
Oh. I-I-I don't have
any clothes.

13:06.032 --> 13:09.893
You spilled Curaçao all over
my... my... my... my shirt.

13:09.986 --> 13:12.228
You ripped my pants.
My bag is at the airport.

13:12.305 --> 13:13.310
- I mean...
- I got you covered.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.993
Why are there
so many bras?

13:15.108 --> 13:17.309
Are women in that big
of a hurry to leave afterwards?

13:17.386 --> 13:20.512
Hey, my love life's kind of
like the airport TGI Fridays.

13:20.589 --> 13:22.747
It is all about
turning those tables.

13:22.824 --> 13:25.494
Look at this. I feel like I'm in
Filene's Basement.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.576
Oh, shit,
I've gotta take this.

13:28.789 --> 13:30.446
Brockmire.
It's Whitney.

13:30.523 --> 13:33.849
Is this a good time?
Well, uh, you tell me.

13:39.833 --> 13:42.392
Hi. I was interested
in changing my flight.

13:42.469 --> 13:44.803
I have a flight tonight,
and I was wondering

13:44.880 --> 13:47.330
what your policy is
about getting reimbursed.

13:47.407 --> 13:49.521
I reviewed the data,
and, overwhelmingly,

13:49.589 --> 13:51.306
it seems like the greatest
benefit to the franchise

13:51.374 --> 13:53.012
would be to go with Raj.

13:53.623 --> 13:55.268
Okay.
That's...

13:55.415 --> 13:59.026
pretty much what I figured.
But I was overruled.

13:59.533 --> 14:00.934
What?

14:03.156 --> 14:04.739
My flight got canceled.

14:05.684 --> 14:07.326
My flight got canceled.

14:09.554 --> 14:10.713
Hey.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.516
You're not gonna believe this,
but my flight got canceled.

14:13.584 --> 14:14.658
Jules, I got it.

14:14.746 --> 14:17.953
I got the job! I am...
I'm going to Atlanta!

14:18.190 --> 14:20.916
- Yeah!
- Wait, what?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.291
How is this possible?

14:23.367 --> 14:25.302
You never mentioned there was
a chance you were leaving.

14:25.369 --> 14:26.779
Jules, I didn't think
there was,

14:26.847 --> 14:28.051
but I gotta get to Atlanta

14:28.119 --> 14:30.036
and press the flesh
of my benefactors.

14:30.104 --> 14:31.786
- When?
- Now.

14:32.007 --> 14:33.248
You're meeting them today?

14:33.316 --> 14:34.995
Well, the meeting's not
till Wednesday,

14:35.063 --> 14:36.345
but I'm taking
the next flight.

14:36.422 --> 14:38.365
- Well, change it.
- Oh, Jules, I would love to.

14:38.436 --> 14:40.383
No, I really would,
but, you know,

14:40.460 --> 14:42.167
I-I-I kind of like
to tool around a city

14:42.235 --> 14:44.948
and get to know it for a couple
of days before I represent it.

14:45.016 --> 14:47.572
I mean, you know...
kinda my process.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.392
Your process?
What are you, Basquiat?

14:49.469 --> 14:50.893
You report things
that people

14:50.961 --> 14:52.361
can already see
with their own eyes.

14:52.429 --> 14:54.297
Well, some people would say
there's kind of an art

14:54.364 --> 14:56.784
- to what I do.
- I changed my flight for you!

14:57.028 --> 14:58.775
You told me it was...
It was cancelled.

14:58.843 --> 15:01.400
I lied! Obviously!

15:01.956 --> 15:04.282
- Jesus, just... Yeah. Call a taxi.
- All right.

15:04.351 --> 15:06.163
No, no, no, no, no.
I'll... I'll push my flight.

15:06.231 --> 15:08.609
- Don't do me any favors.
- Ple... I want to. I do.

15:08.677 --> 15:10.044
Of course,
I wanna push my flight, J...

15:10.111 --> 15:12.661
Hey, come on.
Please don't leave now.

15:17.564 --> 15:18.830
Why not?

15:21.968 --> 15:23.568
Well, beignets.

15:27.016 --> 15:28.419
- What will it be?
- Two beignets,

15:28.487 --> 15:30.212
we know that for sure,
and...

15:30.385 --> 15:31.634
A chicory coffee.

15:31.711 --> 15:34.171
No, uh, regular.
Two regular coffees, please.

15:34.255 --> 15:35.515
Allow me to explain.

15:35.596 --> 15:38.116
Um, chicory
was originally marketed

15:38.184 --> 15:40.844
as kind of a filler
to make coffee go farther.

15:40.921 --> 15:43.245
It's kind of like
it's a dried up old beet root

15:43.322 --> 15:44.855
with absolutely
no caffeine in it.

15:44.932 --> 15:47.525
Drinking chicory coffee
when regular coffee is available

15:47.602 --> 15:51.854
is kind of like seeing a bong full
of fresh Jack Herer and going,

15:51.931 --> 15:53.589
"Nah, no, thanks.
I'll just, uh...

15:53.666 --> 15:55.332
I'll take
that half-smoked spliff

15:55.409 --> 15:57.694
out of that ashtray
over there."

15:57.771 --> 16:00.537
- Do you ever shut up?
- I do not, no.

16:00.614 --> 16:03.053
But, hey, you knew that,
didn't you?

16:04.077 --> 16:06.269
- I'm such an idiot!
- No, you're not.

16:06.346 --> 16:08.145
You're not an idiot.
You didn't know.

16:08.222 --> 16:10.694
Chicory is real popular
around here.

16:14.256 --> 16:15.541
Jules!

16:20.026 --> 16:21.405
What's up?

16:24.933 --> 16:28.349
I started thinking,
"I like it here, and...

16:29.317 --> 16:31.153
I like being with Jim."

16:32.726 --> 16:34.363
If I don't buy
into this team,

16:34.440 --> 16:36.365
that's five months
during the off-season.

16:36.442 --> 16:37.919
Maybe I could split
my time between...

16:37.986 --> 16:40.529
Well, yes. We...
Why can't we do that?

16:40.751 --> 16:42.629
An hour ago,
it was New Orleans.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.425
Now it's Atlanta. What's it
gonna be in six months?

16:44.492 --> 16:47.251
- I can't just follow you around!
- Why not?

16:47.328 --> 16:49.746
Jules, I am...
I am very delightful.

16:49.991 --> 16:52.990
I have a life in Morristown, in
case you forgot. No, I know.

16:53.058 --> 16:54.402
I know better than
to ask you to leave there.

16:54.469 --> 16:56.070
- But, look, Jules...
- Then what are you saying?

16:56.137 --> 16:58.904
I am saying I've been
doing some thinking, too.

16:58.972 --> 17:01.765
Tonight was amazing.
I mean, it was just...

17:01.833 --> 17:03.683
Right? It was unbelievable.

17:03.973 --> 17:05.800
Why can't we meet up
once a month

17:05.903 --> 17:07.195
at one of my road games?

17:07.272 --> 17:09.865
Could be in Miami or St. Louis,
Cincinnati, wherever.

17:09.942 --> 17:11.942
The point is, it will be
a night just like tonight,

17:12.019 --> 17:13.868
we'll be two people,
we won't know anybody.

17:13.938 --> 17:15.553
We'll be free
to just explore a new city.

17:15.621 --> 17:18.290
We can just drink
and dance and just...

17:18.358 --> 17:20.009
screw and...

17:20.086 --> 17:22.644
We can just...
We can disappear, Jules.

17:26.557 --> 17:27.991
So, a bender?

17:28.085 --> 17:31.108
No, okay, yes... no.
But, yes, all right.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.881
Well, just think about it,
just for a second.

17:32.948 --> 17:35.097
All highs, no lows.
Right?

17:35.165 --> 17:37.761
We'll never have to fight over
who empties the dishwasher

17:37.838 --> 17:39.370
or pick up
each other's dry cleaning

17:39.447 --> 17:42.375
or ask each other,
"How was your day, hon?"

17:42.443 --> 17:43.451
Jules, I'll never
have to pretend

17:43.518 --> 17:44.968
that I didn't
just hear you fart.

17:45.143 --> 17:47.111
Okay, think about that.
No, wait... no, really!

17:47.188 --> 17:49.247
We just cut out all
the mundane bullshit

17:49.324 --> 17:52.492
and get right to
the perfect relationship.

17:55.685 --> 17:58.444
The "mundane bullshit"
<i>is</i> a relationship.

17:58.624 --> 18:00.801
Yeah, but I know, but why settle
for that when we can...

18:00.868 --> 18:04.871
You know, we can make up our own rules!
Because I'd still be settling.

18:05.295 --> 18:07.068
I want someone to have
a night like tonight with

18:07.136 --> 18:08.951
who'll also be there
when I wake up in the morning.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.093
I want to have adventures
with someone,

18:10.160 --> 18:13.221
but I also want someone
to pay the bills with and...

18:13.349 --> 18:14.545
go grocery shopping

18:14.613 --> 18:17.213
and tell me when it's time
to wash my smelly jeans.

18:17.281 --> 18:19.728
And I deserve all that.
Jules, you do.

18:19.809 --> 18:21.611
Dear God, you do.

18:22.749 --> 18:25.441
It's all I can offer you
right now, though.

18:26.753 --> 18:30.200
You have a choice, and you're not
choosing me... again!

18:30.365 --> 18:33.029
Come on. That's a very harsh way
to put it.

18:33.354 --> 18:35.688
What are you doing? I was gonna
take you to the airport.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.097
I won't subject you
to that mundane shit,<i> hon.</i>

18:42.217 --> 18:43.936
Your beignets
are ready.

19:28.247 --> 19:29.278
Hey.

19:29.415 --> 19:31.876
- I'll have what he's having.
- What?

19:32.432 --> 19:34.277
It's a callback,
asshole.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.657
Give me
a Sazerac, neat.

19:41.627 --> 19:44.821
Well, everybody, I want you
to enjoy yourselves!

19:44.898 --> 19:47.098
Soak up every last moment
of New Orleans

19:47.175 --> 19:49.025
that you possibly can.
Why?

19:49.235 --> 19:51.911
Because the sea levels,
they are rising faster

19:51.979 --> 19:54.988
than even the most dire
predictions, and nobody,

19:55.056 --> 19:58.848
and I mean <i> nobody</i> in power
seems to give a shit about that.

19:58.973 --> 20:01.090
Two generations. Two.

20:01.174 --> 20:03.964
All the above-ground cemeteries,
they're gonna be underwater.

20:04.075 --> 20:07.251
So, uh... yeah, we're all
just playing a fiddle

20:07.328 --> 20:09.249
while Rome drowns,
aren't we?

20:09.379 --> 20:11.385
So <i> salud.</i>

20:16.573 --> 20:17.905
What's so funny
down there?

20:18.070 --> 20:20.321
Oh, nothing, Al Gore.

20:20.562 --> 20:23.726
Thanks for
the climate-change lecture.

20:23.803 --> 20:25.694
I'll be sure
to buy a Prius.

20:25.972 --> 20:27.564
Not saying we should
try to stop it.

20:27.632 --> 20:31.159
I'm saying we should embrace it.
Just embrace the futility.

20:32.690 --> 20:36.420
You sound like a junior-high kid
who just discovered Nietzsche.

20:36.547 --> 20:39.947
Yeah, well, it's not my first
nihilist rodeo, I assure you.

20:44.832 --> 20:50.354
So you really think
our actions are meaningless?

20:50.538 --> 20:51.959
That...

20:52.834 --> 20:55.201
consequences
don't matter?

20:57.243 --> 20:58.641
Prove it.

20:59.669 --> 21:01.810
And how would you
like me to do that?

21:05.331 --> 21:08.501
Oh, shit!

21:12.584 --> 21:15.914
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Looking for my Tide Pen.

21:16.227 --> 21:18.321
Jesus Christ!

21:18.528 --> 21:21.109
When you're really ready to go
down the rabbit hole,

21:21.202 --> 21:22.404
call me.

21:23.329 --> 21:24.867
All right, okay.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.617
Shit.

21:31.487 --> 21:33.556
Are you...
Are you all right?

21:33.703 --> 21:35.336
Mm-hmm.

21:36.305 --> 21:42.760
