WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:03.166
Previously on Farscape.

00:03.254 --> 00:07.293
(whispering ):
Aeryn is with child.

00:07.383 --> 00:11.126
Aeryn isn't sure if the child
is John Crichton's.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.883
A relationship is
based on trust.

00:14.974 --> 00:16.180
I'm so sorry.

00:16.267 --> 00:22.137
I would put my life in your
hands but not my heart.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.142
Distillate of Laka.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.189
One whiff, and the
pain is gone.

00:26.277 --> 00:28.268
For a time.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.150
Take it for as long as
you need it.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.699
(coughs and clears throat)

00:35.786 --> 00:37.617
I don't need it.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.161
Just takes the edge off.

00:39.248 --> 00:42.832
In view of the continuing danger
we face in Peacekeeper space,

00:42.919 --> 00:49.210
I'm reluctantly forced to
considertraveling into
Tormented Space.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.133
Can't be as bad as some of the
places we've been lately.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.051
Aeryn:
Trust me.

00:55.306 --> 00:57.297
It can.

00:58.434 --> 01:01.301
And now, on Farscape.

01:04.482 --> 01:08.066
(child humming)

01:09.278 --> 01:11.269
Don't touch that!

01:22.583 --> 01:24.414
You knew our laws when
you arrived.

01:24.502 --> 01:25.787
l was just having fun.

01:25.878 --> 01:29.496
Banishment is lenient for
your indiscretion.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.966
Woman:
Many indiscretions.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.633
No wonder... no wonder your men
were begging for it.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.880
This isn't helping.

01:35.972 --> 01:37.303
Chiana:
With drells like you...

01:37.390 --> 01:40.302
No wonder you're thrown off
every planet you land on.

01:40.393 --> 01:41.974
E'Alet.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.347
You...

01:44.438 --> 01:47.601
you're... you're friends
with the guy up top.

01:47.692 --> 01:50.900
Maybe I... I can appeal
to him one on one.

01:50.987 --> 01:57.324
The Prefect has already denied
your petition, but bids you
a safe journey.

01:57.410 --> 01:58.570
Woman:
Banish her now!

01:58.661 --> 02:00.526
Chiana:
After all I did for you!

02:03.332 --> 02:05.618
(humming continues)

02:16.971 --> 02:19.212
Moya is up there floating
dormant in space.

02:19.307 --> 02:23.425
This is the first planet in
twenty that we've found that
has any drinking water.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.261
You are going to get
us kicked off.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.562
ldidn't do anything.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.476
I know your need for vengeance.

02:33.571 --> 02:35.152
Do you, Gaashah?

02:35.239 --> 02:38.447
Would you sit by if an outsider
had been with your son?

02:38.534 --> 02:40.991
Oh. Is he the cute one?

02:41.078 --> 02:42.033
I remember him.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.112
What's your kid's name?
Zer-boy?

02:44.206 --> 02:45.161
Zerbat!

02:45.249 --> 02:46.910
Oh, Zerbat.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.663
Chiana, you are such a fekkik.

02:51.464 --> 02:53.420
Chiana?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.498
Come here now.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.299
I've preprogrammed a
course for Moya.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.796
I'll be bored to death
out there.

02:58.888 --> 03:00.378
Well Chiana, you've
been banished.

03:00.473 --> 03:03.306
Yeah, only from Gaashah's clan.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.385
One prospect in each one.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.141
Oh, that's a great idea.
-Come on.

03:09.231 --> 03:12.519
Now, once you're in there, don't
touch any of the controls.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.771
More than you know is
at stake here.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.147
I understand...

03:16.238 --> 03:17.364
Nothing.

03:17.448 --> 03:19.860
No one does.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.362
Unity of the clans is new.

03:22.453 --> 03:24.193
Peace is new.

03:24.288 --> 03:28.076
But even I know such peace is
too fragile to be endangered...

03:28.167 --> 03:30.283
(engine roaring)

03:33.339 --> 03:36.376
...by some indelicate whore.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.924
(roaring)

03:40.638 --> 03:42.629
Crichton:
Gone but not forgotten.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.256
What of the others?

03:45.351 --> 03:47.342
What, Aeryn and Sikozu?

03:47.436 --> 03:48.892
No, no. Nun and nunner.

03:48.979 --> 03:52.016
Perfect ladies at all times.

03:52.108 --> 03:53.723
Aeryn:
Crichton.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.143
Yeah, I gotta take this.

03:57.238 --> 04:02.278
Aeryn, | see that Elvis has
left the building.

04:02.368 --> 04:04.233
What? What does that mean?

04:04.328 --> 04:09.322
That means that Prefect Falaak
has graciously accepted our
apology for Chiana's conduct,

04:09.417 --> 04:13.410
as well as our emergency
generator as compensation.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.549
(giggling)
Come on.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.922
Aeryn?

04:23.013 --> 04:24.423
It's a good deal.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.346
It allows us all to stay
on the planet.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.426
The Comms are frelled.
Call me later.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.565
Seems a bit moody.

04:33.649 --> 04:35.731
Man, you should have
met her mother.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.778
Gaashah:
The only risk is that my failure

04:41.866 --> 04:44.949
will signal there's more to be
gained from war than from peace.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.289
Let me help you.

04:49.373 --> 04:53.412
The less anyone sees of you and
your friends, the better for me.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.262
Aeryn, I talked to Rygel.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.344
He said that Moya's still
out of commission.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.725
How you doing?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.193
I'm getting a really bad bribe.

05:18.277 --> 05:20.609
Oh God, she's talking English.

05:20.696 --> 05:24.280
"Vibe." It's a really bad vibe.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.072
( sniffing )

05:28.412 --> 05:30.323
(sighing)

05:30.414 --> 05:32.029
D'Argo may be right.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.911
Until we find another source
of food and water...

05:45.638 --> 05:47.299
Officer Sun?

05:47.389 --> 05:50.005
I'll get back to you.

06:31.684 --> 06:35.597
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

06:35.688 --> 06:39.146
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.269
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

06:41.360 --> 06:44.318
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

06:44.405 --> 06:46.396
my friends.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.277
I've made enemies.

06:49.368 --> 06:52.360
Powerful, dangerous.

06:52.454 --> 06:56.197
Now all I want is to
find a way home

06:56.292 --> 06:59.034
to warn Earth.

06:59.128 --> 07:04.168
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.537
I'm such a welnitz, Gaashah.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.745
You're gonna be Prefect soon.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.417
I could always come back then.

07:42.504 --> 07:47.544
That would be suicide for
you and your friends.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.626
Oh?

07:49.720 --> 07:53.087
This place is run by
tight asses.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.594
How can you be so selfish?

07:56.685 --> 07:59.176
Moya is up there floating
dormant in space.

07:59.271 --> 08:03.230
This is the first planet in
twenty that we've found that
has any drinking water.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.809
You're going to get
us kicked off.

08:06.904 --> 08:08.235
What?

08:08.322 --> 08:09.732
Frell you.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.656
You are such a fekkik.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.779
Gaashah. Gaashah, wait.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.329
Gaashah...

08:20.834 --> 08:23.541
Give me a reason not
to kill you.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.665
All of you. Now.

08:28.258 --> 08:32.592
One stab, my clan is avenged.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.137
The leaders are reassured.

08:35.224 --> 08:39.217
I am made Prefect,
a hero to my people.

08:39.311 --> 08:44.055
We are going to leave the
microt our Leviathan revives.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.061
Only criminals come to
this part of space.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.485
Perhaps there's a price
on your head.

08:50.572 --> 08:53.234
A bounty I could claim
for my people?

08:55.494 --> 09:00.784
Killing you would improve
everything.

09:00.874 --> 09:05.334
We Luxans, too, struggle to
overcome our violent past.

09:06.088 --> 09:10.548
It's what I know in my bones.

09:10.634 --> 09:14.718
As my father knew, and his
father before him.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.719
More than you know is
at stake here.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.016
I understand...

09:21.103 --> 09:22.559
Nothing.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.183
No one does.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.606
Unity of the clans is new.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.433
Peace is new.

09:29.528 --> 09:33.316
But even I know such peace is
too fragile to be endangered...

09:33.407 --> 09:35.773
(engine roaring)

09:38.620 --> 09:42.829
...by some indelicate whore.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.329
Nobody on this planet gives
a dren about Chiana.

09:46.420 --> 09:49.537
The problem isn't simply her.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.211
It's your son.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.156
When the wars were ongoing,

10:25.250 --> 10:31.086
I traded my herd to send Zerbat
off-planet, where he'd be safe,

10:31.173 --> 10:34.085
where he could learn other
disciplines.

10:34.176 --> 10:37.418
And a Prefect's son cannot
be seen as an outsider.

10:38.931 --> 10:42.844
All the other clans view him as
corrupted by outside influences.

10:44.061 --> 10:47.144
And then we bring Chiana.

10:47.231 --> 10:49.313
(roaring)

12:02.264 --> 12:04.346
It all smells wonderful.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.548
Gaashah.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.175
Ucuz.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.134
Ucuz?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.311
Ripe from harvest.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.556
Our women nurse their
babies with it.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.027
Mmm...
-Brother.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.146
( D'Argo clears throat )

12:17.237 --> 12:18.272
(Gaashah laughing)

12:18.363 --> 12:23.198
No. No, really, it's very,
very good.

12:23.285 --> 12:27.244
Jabuka clan's finest etmek.

12:27.331 --> 12:30.073
Jabuka clan etmek...

12:33.545 --> 12:35.786
...is most tasty.

12:35.881 --> 12:38.088
Fit for a Prefect.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.211
A flavor...

12:40.302 --> 12:42.258
you may never know.

12:46.892 --> 12:50.259
I thought your ascension to the
prefecture was predetermined?

12:50.354 --> 12:53.687
If he acquires enough votes,
I can be removed as unworthy.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.605
Removed how?

12:56.818 --> 12:59.275
Kill you?

12:59.363 --> 13:02.901
It's one of Paroos' little...
negotiations.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.985
200 clans, 200 chieftains...

13:08.080 --> 13:11.413
2,000 grudges to accommodate.

13:11.500 --> 13:15.368
One little priest has that much
sway over all the clans?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.374
Oh, he can be... compelling.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.877
Compelling enough for you
to risk your own life?

13:20.968 --> 13:23.960
The only risk is that
my failure

13:24.054 --> 13:27.296
will signal there's more to be
gained from war than from peace.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.471
Let me help you.

13:32.562 --> 13:36.771
The less anyone sees of you and
your friends, the better for me.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.982
D'Argo:
He wants us to leave.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.692
Crichton:
Moya may not be revived yet.

13:48.787 --> 13:50.152
I think you should go.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.783
( in Scottish accent):
What if! don't want to, Cap'n?

13:51.873 --> 13:53.864
He respects me. It would help
if I could show him

13:53.959 --> 13:56.621
that I have you under some sort
of control, more or less.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.953
Right. I'll check in
with the ship.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.125
(whispering ):
Hey,

14:01.216 --> 14:03.548
(clicking tongue)
Sikozu?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.591
Tasting the local spices,
are we?

14:05.679 --> 14:08.261
Go away, you dirty girl.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.634
(growling)

14:10.726 --> 14:15.015
They would stone you to death
if I turned you in.

14:15.105 --> 14:19.724
Okay. They have banished me
for being with nobodies.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.309
I would say they'd probably
impale you on a pole

14:22.404 --> 14:25.066
for shacking up with
their prince.

14:25.157 --> 14:27.944
We're not shacking up.

14:28.035 --> 14:30.321
I would not tell anyone about
this if I were you.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.949
I'm not even meant to be here.
Who am I gonna tell?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.280
D'Argo:
Exactly!

14:34.374 --> 14:37.787
That's what I wanna know, when I
put you on that Prowler myself!

14:37.878 --> 14:39.459
How did you get off it?!

14:39.546 --> 14:41.457
How did you get the autopilot
turned off?!
-You wanna know how I got off?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.254
No, I don't wanna know.
-Of course I got off it!

14:43.341 --> 14:45.081
I don't wanna know!

14:45.177 --> 14:47.213
What I do wanna know...
-Yeah, what do you wanna know?

14:47.304 --> 14:50.796
...is does anyone else know
that you're here?
-You tell me what you wanna know.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.803
Of course not. I'm just sneaking
around like I always am.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.009
Good.
-Yeah.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.764
Well, turn around...
-Frell you!

14:56.855 --> 14:58.891
...and sneak back to the ship.

14:58.982 --> 15:00.313
Chiana:
You know what?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.062
I think this Captain thing has
really gone to your head!

15:03.278 --> 15:05.064
Okay.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.271
Crichton wants you back on
the Transport Pod now.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.026
And don't argue.

15:09.117 --> 15:14.202
The sooner she goes, she and
all of us will be able
to come back.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.200
It's your father who
needs you now.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.576
He's right.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.749
(weapons firing )

15:22.089 --> 15:23.545
It's a good deal.

15:23.632 --> 15:26.465
It allows us all to stay
on the planet.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.928
Aeryn?

15:29.012 --> 15:31.219
Aeryn:
The Comms are frelled.
Call me later.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.930
Seems a bit moody.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.133
You should have met her mother.

15:36.228 --> 15:38.139
Well...

15:38.230 --> 15:39.845
I should be going.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.896
You have to pack up and hand
over the keys to a new tenant.

15:41.983 --> 15:46.317
Interesting system you have.
Every half cycle, a new
leader takes over.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.269
It's a little disruptive.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.902
Well, they say change is good.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.152
Invigorating.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.326
It's frightening.

15:54.412 --> 15:57.745
It takes a three day festival
to distract from the terror

15:57.833 --> 16:02.327
that someone from another clan
is assuming power.

16:02.420 --> 16:07.255
It took me months of haggling
beyond that to gain the
slightest support.

16:07.342 --> 16:12.257
Mmm. Betterthan, uh, clubs
and machetes approach.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.339
Many would be eager to
return to that.

16:15.433 --> 16:17.640
At least we understood it.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.017
Right.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.808
Well, have a nice day.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.231
(panting)

16:27.070 --> 16:30.153
You've returned seeking
forgiveness.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.279
Well, I know how you feel
about nixers like me.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.654
(sinister chuckling)

16:35.745 --> 16:39.784
I rather like nixers like you.

16:42.294 --> 16:44.250
So is it true what they say
about priests?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.168
Hmm...

16:46.256 --> 16:49.669
They give great religious
expenence?

16:49.759 --> 16:53.502
What I give is great
consequence.

16:53.597 --> 16:56.054
D'Argo:
I'm no ambassador.

16:56.141 --> 17:00.100
Crichton:
Well, you got Gaashah talking
without giving away parts of the ship.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.222
That's better than I did.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.348
He wants us to leave.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.270
Moya may not be revived yet.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.224
Well, I think it's important
that the future Prefect knows
he can count on me.

17:07.319 --> 17:10.402
Hey, Moya's notjust taking a
catnap up there, you know.

17:10.488 --> 17:13.446
This Tormented area of space is
beating the crap out of her.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.151
( in Scottish accent):
And I don't know when I can get
the systems back on line, Cap'n.

17:17.245 --> 17:19.281
I think you should go.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.873
What if! don't want to, Cap'n?

17:20.957 --> 17:22.993
He respects me. It would help
if I could show him that

17:23.084 --> 17:24.494
I have you under some
sort of control,

17:24.586 --> 17:25.575
more or less.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.535
Right. I'll check in
with the ship.

17:27.631 --> 17:29.747
Ryg, what's shaking
up there, man?

17:29.841 --> 17:30.876
ls Chiana back yet?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.878
Rygel:
I didn't know she was coming.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.300
Well, you know Chiana.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.799
I guess that means Moya's
senses are still out.

17:41.436 --> 17:45.679
I am... puzzled by
off-worlders.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.308
Yeah. I know what you mean.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.486
I have... concerns about you.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.906
( chuckles )
A lot of people feel that way.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.202
Your boss seems to think
I'm okay, so...

18:09.130 --> 18:10.290
Be careful.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.873
The stairs are quite slippery.

18:12.968 --> 18:15.175
(thunder rumbling)

18:15.262 --> 18:17.173
Thanks for the warning.

18:23.228 --> 18:24.308
Crichton:
Aeryn?

18:24.396 --> 18:26.352
Thank you.
-Talked to Rygel.

18:26.439 --> 18:29.226
He said that Moya is still out
of commission. How you doing?

18:29.317 --> 18:31.478
I'm getting a really bad bribe.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.106
Oh God, she's talking English.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.689
"Vibe." It's a really bad vibe.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.024
( sniffing )

18:39.119 --> 18:40.609
D'Argo may be right.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.116
Until we find another source
of food and water,

18:43.206 --> 18:46.414
cozying up to Gaashah may
be the only solution.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.623
Officer Sun?

18:53.925 --> 18:55.506
I'll, um...

18:55.593 --> 18:57.458
I'll get back to you.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.056
( child's footsteps approach )

19:04.144 --> 19:06.556
(child mutters)

19:10.734 --> 19:12.975
(weapons firing )

19:13.069 --> 19:14.605
(weapons firing )

19:23.288 --> 19:25.870
( screaming )

19:33.298 --> 19:36.506
(yelling):
No!

19:37.761 --> 19:40.093
( screams )

20:58.425 --> 21:00.336
D'Argo:
It was Aeryn.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.292
What? No way. Aeryn wouldn't...

21:02.387 --> 21:04.469
I know who shot me.

21:04.556 --> 21:06.012
D'Argo:
She wasn't even looking.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.509
D'Argo, Aeryn would not...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.807
I know who shot me!

21:09.894 --> 21:10.929
(grunts)

21:11.020 --> 21:12.305
Take their weapons.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.147
Chiana:
Frell.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.812
Right! Hold it.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.441
Where is the assassin?

21:18.528 --> 21:21.235
I wouldn't tell you,
even if! knew.

21:21.322 --> 21:24.689
You came to the planet together.
You're all assassins together.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.526
She shot him, too fekface.
-Quiet!

21:27.620 --> 21:29.451
Tell me where she is, or I'll
have your head as well.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.451
That is not your decision.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.328
Keep out of this, priest.

21:34.419 --> 21:38.003
Paroos:
The clans agreed to
follow the law.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.795
The law says we can hunt
down murderers.

21:39.883 --> 21:45.344
Only by command of the clan's
next leader, Gaashah's son.

21:45.430 --> 21:47.341
The boy?!

21:47.432 --> 21:48.512
A leader?

21:48.600 --> 21:49.965
Where's his weapon?

21:50.059 --> 21:51.310
Where's the fire in his eyes?

21:51.394 --> 21:55.558
He's as much an outsider as
those who murdered his father!

21:55.648 --> 21:56.854
Who broke the peace?

21:56.941 --> 21:57.771
( inhales deeply)

21:57.859 --> 21:59.941
What clan attacked?

22:00.028 --> 22:02.189
Not a clan, an outsider.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.066
She escaped us.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.317
Find her.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.363
Kill her.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.942
And if she acted on
anyone's behalf

22:09.037 --> 22:15.124
we'll catch her and torture her
until she tells us.

22:17.253 --> 22:20.916
The way the clans tortured
the others?

22:21.007 --> 22:21.757
Others?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.957
Crichton:
What others?

22:24.052 --> 22:26.293
Two clan leaders were killed.

22:26.387 --> 22:27.968
Before we arrived?

22:28.056 --> 22:30.422
And you drenheads are trying
to blame that on us?

22:30.517 --> 22:33.759
Look, just let me go. I'll...

22:33.853 --> 22:35.354
I'll bring her back.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.394
You make a lot of noise...

22:37.482 --> 22:38.938
for an outsider.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.265
I will go.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.233
I have the right to
avenge my father.

22:46.324 --> 22:49.441
To see his killer
brought to justice.

22:51.704 --> 22:54.912
That is the law.

22:54.999 --> 22:58.662
Jabuka:
And will you need your nanny?

22:58.753 --> 23:00.414
My father is dead.

23:00.505 --> 23:03.542
You just insulted the
leader of his clan.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.585
I will go, and I'll take
him with me.

23:09.764 --> 23:11.925
He will lead me to her.

23:12.934 --> 23:17.394
We have another duty first.

23:18.106 --> 23:21.098
The burial sacraments.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.942
Maybe Gaashah wasn't
even the target.

23:28.032 --> 23:31.320
Maybe she was aiming at
something else and he wandered
into the line of fire.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.151
You're talking about my father.

23:33.246 --> 23:37.285
His blood is still wet on the
ground thanks to your friend's
vicious hand.

23:38.459 --> 23:39.915
It's my mistake.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.834
I was just thinking out loud
trying to figure out why.

23:41.921 --> 23:46.130
Why? Why an outsider would come
all this way to kill my father,
a good man?

23:46.217 --> 23:47.252
( cocks weapon )

23:47.343 --> 23:50.551
And my father was a good man.

23:51.681 --> 23:53.467
Sikozu:
Are you going to kill him here?

23:54.851 --> 23:58.343
What? Did you come to question
my resolve?

24:02.567 --> 24:05.229
I can handle this myself.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.859
By putting a gun to the head of
the only person who can
help us find Aeryn?

24:10.533 --> 24:13.195
I am leader of my tribe now.

24:14.662 --> 24:17.074
Which makes you what?

24:17.165 --> 24:19.998
Just like all the rest?

24:22.754 --> 24:27.919
Crichton:
Maybe we should keep moving
before Aeryn takes out another clan leader.

24:29.636 --> 24:32.218
I think that maybe we
should split up.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.261
Zerbat:
So you can run?

24:34.349 --> 24:38.388
Son, at this point, you either
trust me or you don't.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.598
Right.

24:41.689 --> 24:44.522
Sikozu and I will take the
trail up the ridge.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.315
You continue along the bank.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.235
We'll cross down to you
further along.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.445
(thunder rumbling)

24:54.535 --> 25:00.531
(singing quietly):
Oh, you take the high road
and I'll take the low road

25:02.335 --> 25:05.372
And I'll be in Scotland
before you.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.840
(thunder rumbling)

25:11.678 --> 25:14.090
Aeryn:
Behind you.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.177
Did I kill Gaashah?

25:23.439 --> 25:25.270
Yeah.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.307
Why?

25:30.071 --> 25:32.278
I have no idea.

25:33.324 --> 25:37.067
That's all I rememberthinking.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.618
I can't stop myself.

25:40.415 --> 25:42.781
What about the others?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.127
What others?

25:47.046 --> 25:48.911
D'Argo, for one.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.337
What?

25:50.425 --> 25:53.087
He'll be all right.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.261
There were no others.

25:57.348 --> 25:59.589
It was just Gaashah.
One clean shot.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.974
How much chakan oil for
one clean shot?

26:15.450 --> 26:17.236
(weapon clicks )

26:23.541 --> 26:25.748
How many?

26:26.461 --> 26:28.167
How many people did I kill?

26:28.254 --> 26:30.540
Paroos:
Seventeen.

26:31.299 --> 26:33.255
You better slow down, Crusty.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.505
People kill each other on
this planet all the time.

26:36.596 --> 26:42.512
Finding a way to kill Gaashah
was finding a way to start war.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.093
She has no reason to
start a war.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.269
I know.

26:47.356 --> 26:50.769
I suspect you're being used.

26:51.402 --> 26:52.903
By who?

26:52.987 --> 26:57.947
I need evidence. Until now,
nothing presented itself.

26:58.034 --> 27:01.526
The other assassins were
both killed instantly.

27:01.621 --> 27:06.240
She's the only one left alive
long enough to speak.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.242
But I was completely
out of control.

27:09.337 --> 27:11.202
I don't remember anything.

27:12.298 --> 27:17.668
Then we must see to it
that you do.

27:18.221 --> 27:22.134
I aimed and I shot him.

27:22.225 --> 27:23.886
Paroos:
And...?

27:23.976 --> 27:25.932
And that's all I see.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.557
We're not getting anywhere.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.513
Try again.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.563
I'm trying.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.647
It's all I see.
It's all I remember.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.356
Paroos:
Then don't see.

27:40.451 --> 27:42.032
Listen.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.701
(sighs)

27:52.421 --> 27:54.798
There was a child.

27:55.299 --> 27:56.550
Is he...

27:56.634 --> 27:59.467
Still alive.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.920
(sighs)

28:02.014 --> 28:03.345
(grunts)

28:05.309 --> 28:07.174
I hit the child?

28:09.021 --> 28:11.433
Uh... (pants)

28:13.067 --> 28:15.524
Why did I hit the child?

28:20.908 --> 28:22.944
No.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.948
That wasn't real.
I never really hit him.

28:27.039 --> 28:30.076
I never actually hit the child.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.703
( insect buzzing )

28:33.212 --> 28:34.952
Who cares?

28:38.593 --> 28:40.959
A bug.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.839
( buzzing )

28:44.849 --> 28:48.137
Aeryn:
A... a... a bug...

28:48.769 --> 28:50.384
bit me and I...

28:50.479 --> 28:52.435
(distorted buzzing )

28:52.523 --> 28:53.433
Uh...

28:53.524 --> 28:55.105
( loud buzzing )

28:55.192 --> 28:59.276
(panicked grunting)

29:03.743 --> 29:05.529
A bug.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.110
A bug bit me.

29:08.205 --> 29:11.697
Paroos:
There are no bugs
on this planet.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.627
( breath quivers )

29:24.263 --> 29:26.219
(panting)

29:26.307 --> 29:28.172
I killed them.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.806
I killed those people.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.276
|ki...

29:41.364 --> 29:43.855
I killed them all.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.751
( screams )

30:01.968 --> 30:04.129
Bug bites? Flashes?

30:04.220 --> 30:06.256
I killed them all.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.802
I'm gonna leave now.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.768
Before there's another killing.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.470
What?

30:17.441 --> 30:18.692
( draws weapon )

30:18.776 --> 30:20.607
Me.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.982
I'm the next assassin.

30:31.414 --> 30:32.779
(coughing)

30:32.873 --> 30:36.240
Okay. Heap-big smoke. No bugs.
No flashes. Can we breathe now?

30:36.335 --> 30:38.712
Are you sure you're
both stabilized?

30:38.796 --> 30:40.377

Then you may need this.

30:46.554 --> 30:48.169
Winona.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.255
How the hell did you get her?

30:50.349 --> 30:52.089
Peacefully.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.140
For the most part.

30:54.228 --> 30:58.267
Mmm. Uh, we need to go,
quickly.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.858
Nobody's going anywhere!

30:59.942 --> 31:01.728
Please! Reach for it.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.151
Or shall I gun you down the
way you did my father?

31:04.238 --> 31:06.103
He never so much as
drew his blade!

31:06.198 --> 31:09.031
She's not responsible for
Gaashah's death.

31:09.118 --> 31:10.483
A dozen clansmen saw her.

31:10.578 --> 31:11.818
Crichton:
She was being controlled.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.413
( scoffs ):
Lies!

31:13.497 --> 31:17.240
She got bit by an insect which
allowed her to be controlled.

31:17.334 --> 31:19.666
We do not have insects
on this planet.

31:19.754 --> 31:20.869
No?

31:20.963 --> 31:23.375
Well, what do you call that?

31:24.425 --> 31:26.416
Or those?

31:28.929 --> 31:31.261
Why? Who brought them here?

31:31.348 --> 31:33.213
Enemies of peace.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.846
People who want power.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.597
More power.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.189
This is not possible.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.264
It's not possible.

31:41.358 --> 31:44.646
Who did your father trust,
Zerbat?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.526
Paroos.
He always trusted Paroos.

31:50.618 --> 31:53.234
And do you trust your
father's judgment?

31:54.872 --> 31:57.158
And yours.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.787
Then we have work to do.

32:00.878 --> 32:03.961
Hey kids, we may be
forgetting something.

32:04.048 --> 32:06.334
Don't we need to
bug bomb a hive?

32:06.425 --> 32:08.962
Paroos:
The insects are off-world.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.214
I didn't bring them, you
didn't bring them.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.138
So essentially we're
looking for...

32:14.225 --> 32:16.716
An off-worlder.

32:19.605 --> 32:23.223
They have no attraction to this
particular alien species.

32:23.317 --> 32:24.682
Everybody likes me.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.483
(yells)

32:26.570 --> 32:29.858
It's not my fault the priest
is still alive.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.156
These outsiders are difficult.

32:32.243 --> 32:35.235
You told me you could
control them.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.992
The sgabba flies implant subtle
subliminal signals.

32:39.083 --> 32:42.041
My mental powers intensify
those signals.

32:42.128 --> 32:46.713
Your impaired mental powers.

32:46.799 --> 32:49.586
The clansmen's hatred is
easy to exploit.

32:49.677 --> 32:53.261
These outsiders have
no reason to kill.

32:53.347 --> 32:54.928
It takes more sgabba.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.175
More time.

32:56.267 --> 32:58.383
I'm not paying you to
make excuses.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.219
You're here to incite anarchy.
War.

33:01.313 --> 33:03.474
You are not paying me enough.

33:03.566 --> 33:07.525
I want... double.

33:11.323 --> 33:15.862
Will that pay for the extra
sgabba to eliminate
the outsiders?

33:18.289 --> 33:19.950
Of course.

33:20.875 --> 33:23.207
Make your bugs.

33:32.136 --> 33:35.219
(inhaling)

33:57.828 --> 34:01.446
( buzzing )

34:05.252 --> 34:08.244
( buzzing )

34:27.733 --> 34:28.688
(grunts)

34:28.776 --> 34:31.313
( breath quivering )

34:38.327 --> 34:40.067
(grunts)

34:47.795 --> 34:50.207
( insects buzzing )

34:50.297 --> 34:52.379
(grunts)
-Damn!

34:56.262 --> 34:57.877
You gonna be all right
to do this?

34:57.972 --> 35:00.714
Yes, yes! Are you?

35:00.808 --> 35:02.890
Of course you are.
Move. Come on!

35:06.021 --> 35:07.602
I command my clan.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.601
Respect me or kill me.

35:10.401 --> 35:12.483
Go. Leave!

35:12.569 --> 35:14.230
What's going on?
Where's Crichton?

35:14.321 --> 35:17.188
Talk and move, D'Argo.
It's faster.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.275
They're on their way up
to the castle. Hurry!

35:20.369 --> 35:22.280
( quietly):
Crichton?

35:24.123 --> 35:25.078
Anybody?

35:25.165 --> 35:26.325
Crichton:
Chiana, where are you?

35:26.417 --> 35:27.657
Chiana:
Falaak's place.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.207
I'm blind.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.126
We're coming.

35:31.213 --> 35:32.874
The bugs are coming.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.330
The bugs are coming for you.

35:34.425 --> 35:35.665
You saw the hive?

35:35.759 --> 35:38.717
Mm-hmm. The hive's in
E'Alet's head.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.635
(gasping)

35:40.723 --> 35:42.338
Can you hear me?

35:42.433 --> 35:45.516
(grunting)

35:45.602 --> 35:47.763
Can you hear me?

36:10.210 --> 36:12.075
What did you see?

36:12.629 --> 36:14.585
What did you see?

36:21.347 --> 36:23.212
( breathing heavily)

36:23.307 --> 36:24.968
Chiana?

36:25.059 --> 36:26.174
Is Cri... Crichton with you?

36:26.268 --> 36:28.179
Yeah, right here.
Where's the bad guy?

36:28.270 --> 36:31.137
Haven't seen him for a while.

36:31.231 --> 36:32.812
Haven't seen anything.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.141
Too long. This is not
gonna go away.

36:35.235 --> 36:36.611
It's all right.
We'll get you out of here.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.186
Soon. As soon as we find
the beekeeper.

36:39.281 --> 36:40.896
( buzzing )
Damn.

36:40.991 --> 36:42.071
What, bugs?

36:42.159 --> 36:43.194
Yeah, just stay down.

36:43.285 --> 36:45.196
Yeah, I... I can help.
They... they don't bite me.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.825
Just stay down! Damn.
You okay?

36:48.916 --> 36:50.952
No, I think too many more
of these and I'm...

36:51.043 --> 36:52.328
Yeah, I know what you mean.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.536
Good news is, where there's
bugs there's gotta be...

36:56.423 --> 36:57.708
Oh, hell.

37:09.269 --> 37:10.554
Stay down.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.146
(yelling)

37:15.234 --> 37:18.067
( buzzing )

37:18.153 --> 37:20.189
Chiana:
What happened?

37:20.280 --> 37:21.736
Who's here?

37:21.824 --> 37:23.155
Crichton?

37:23.242 --> 37:25.028
Aeryn?

37:27.955 --> 37:30.116
He's still alive.

37:31.291 --> 37:33.873
Aeryn:
Shoot him, then.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.417
You shoot him.

37:35.504 --> 37:37.870
(panting)

37:38.799 --> 37:39.959
I can't.

37:46.140 --> 37:47.721
Me either.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.015
Well, then...

37:52.938 --> 37:54.519
...we have a problem.

37:57.443 --> 37:58.603
Fight it.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.065
lam.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.860
What the frell's going on?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.566
Both:
Stay down!

38:11.290 --> 38:12.575
(gasps )

38:17.921 --> 38:19.377
(Chiana cries out)

38:20.299 --> 38:22.130
Chiana:
Whatever you're doing...

38:22.217 --> 38:23.718
stop.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.544
No.

38:26.638 --> 38:31.177
I'm not sure I have the
strength to miss next time.

38:31.268 --> 38:33.350
Ithink...

38:33.437 --> 38:36.304
I'm just a bad shot.

38:42.070 --> 38:44.277
You know, I really thought...

38:44.364 --> 38:47.401
the coin toss ended badly.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.701
It did.

38:59.004 --> 39:01.211
D'Argo:
Chiana!
Sikozu: Stop her, Chiana!

39:01.298 --> 39:03.254
(grunting)

39:04.259 --> 39:05.248
Stop it!

39:05.344 --> 39:07.130
Aeryn, stop it!
-I can't!

39:07.221 --> 39:10.088
D'Argo:
You can fight against it.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.513
D'Argo, just knock me out.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.010
Knock me out!

39:13.894 --> 39:15.350
Hit me harder, you big sissy.

39:15.437 --> 39:16.301
(grunts)

39:17.272 --> 39:19.183
They're getting stronger.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.150
Priest!

39:21.235 --> 39:22.441
Stop him!

39:22.528 --> 39:23.517
(saw whirring)

39:23.612 --> 39:24.852
(grunting)

39:24.947 --> 39:27.438
( cutting )
( screaming )

39:28.408 --> 39:30.114
( saw stops )

39:30.202 --> 39:31.317
( exhales )

39:32.287 --> 39:34.243
( exhales )

39:36.041 --> 39:37.702
It's gone.

39:37.793 --> 39:38.748
(sighs)

39:38.835 --> 39:40.871
Falaak:
Excellent.

39:40.963 --> 39:45.423
You have extinguished this
threat to our peace.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.293
I declare a feast to celebrate.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.424
You lie!

39:52.140 --> 39:54.051
I heard everything.

39:54.142 --> 39:57.225
You... you hired E'Alet.

39:57.312 --> 40:01.430
And will the clans believe a
banished outsider, hmm?

40:01.525 --> 40:02.890
(chuckling)

40:02.985 --> 40:08.525
You ordered my father's death
so there'd be war.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.776
Welcome home, boy.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.119
(chuckling)

40:13.203 --> 40:14.283
(yelling)

40:15.372 --> 40:17.328
Zerbat, think of your father.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.998
Is this what he wanted?

40:27.050 --> 40:30.383
You know what your treachery
means to your clan.

40:30.470 --> 40:35.590
The others would wipe them out,
man, woman and child.

40:36.268 --> 40:38.805
You can prevent that.

40:38.895 --> 40:41.102
You can die the noble hero.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.680
I'll make it as painless
as possible.

40:44.443 --> 40:47.230
Or you can surrender!

40:47.321 --> 40:50.484
And according to the law,
our laws,

40:50.574 --> 40:54.158
go before the other clans.

40:54.244 --> 40:58.157
And I'll make sure they try
as hard as possible

40:58.248 --> 41:01.365
not to tear your body apart.

41:01.460 --> 41:03.826
I can go either way.

41:03.920 --> 41:08.038
The old, or the new?

41:08.133 --> 41:09.714
You decide.

41:12.596 --> 41:19.684
Falaak:
I'll not be judged by you
or your pitiful council.

41:19.770 --> 41:26.812
Is that your father I hear,
screaming for mercy...

41:38.955 --> 41:40.991
(exhales loudly)

41:45.712 --> 41:48.249
You made your father proud.

41:56.390 --> 41:58.301
Sikozu:
Making the destruction
of your castle

41:58.392 --> 42:02.135
your first order as Prefect
was extremely bold.

42:02.229 --> 42:06.393
Zerbat:
A leader belongs with his
people, not above them.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.558
Sounds like your father talking.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.690
You know I want you to stay.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.575
As an advisor?

42:22.666 --> 42:26.705
Perhaps much more.

42:28.296 --> 42:30.252
( laughs lightly)

42:31.174 --> 42:34.917
I would love nothing more

42:35.011 --> 42:40.506
than to be off that Leviathan
and away from those outsiders.

42:42.686 --> 42:45.302
My term as Prefect is
only half a cycle.

42:45.397 --> 42:48.605
We could leave together,
as we planned.

42:50.026 --> 42:52.358
As you planned.

42:56.199 --> 42:58.736
I'm starting to care about you.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.705
Good. But you're right.

43:05.792 --> 43:09.000
A leader belongs
with his people.

43:14.217 --> 43:18.927
Seriously, that's the longest
this blindness has ever lasted.

43:19.014 --> 43:24.304
Then stop using the vision,
twizzit.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.636
I'm sure you'll be the first to
miss me, next palace coup.

43:27.731 --> 43:31.394
Should have let the bugs
eat your hide.

43:33.320 --> 43:35.811
I'll take that as a
blessing, holy man.

43:35.906 --> 43:38.773
(moaning with pleasure)

43:38.867 --> 43:40.653
(chuckling)

43:40.744 --> 43:44.657
Moya and Pilot are waiting.
We must leave.

43:44.748 --> 43:48.240
What, and leave all these
stradrats behind?

43:51.296 --> 43:52.536
I'm sorry.

43:52.631 --> 43:55.794
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

43:57.385 --> 43:58.340
(grunts)

43:58.428 --> 44:00.510
All right.
