00:57.700 --> 01:00.166
You will not believe
what happened to me.

01:00.233 --> 01:03.033
I'm driving home
down Barns dale avenue,

01:03.100 --> 01:04.834
listening to my yodeling tapes...

01:05.734 --> 01:09.600
when the driver behind me
starts furiously honking his horn.

01:09.667 --> 01:13.266
I decide to be a lady and let him pass,
and what does he do?

01:13.333 --> 01:17.533
Pulls alongside, shouts obscenities
that would make Joan Rivers blush...

01:18.400 --> 01:20.233
then speeds off down the street.

01:20.300 --> 01:22.433
Who cares, Rose?
I got my own problems.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.433
Your own problems?

01:24.500 --> 01:26.166
I can't find my lucky handkerchief.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.233
-Lucky handkerchief?
-What the hell are you, a mina bird?

01:31.033 --> 01:35.133
I'm getting my kit together for a major
bingo game. And it's not here.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.467
There's no way I can play
without it.

01:36.533 --> 01:41.767
-It's like Kareem without his goggles.
-I'm sorry, Sophia. I'm just so upset.

01:41.834 --> 01:45.133
You know, you would feel a lot better if
you had shouted back at the bagagaloupe.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.867
Oh, I couldn't do that.

01:46.934 --> 01:49.567
I get so flustered in those situations.

01:49.633 --> 01:53.433
Hey, a well-chosen gesture
can be very effective.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.333
A little something like this.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.033
Sophia, isn't that obscene?

02:05.100 --> 02:08.166
No. They mean, "Good health,
have a nice day,

02:08.233 --> 02:10.233
and would you like
to squeeze my concertina?"

02:13.066 --> 02:15.767
Dorothy, I don't understand,
you spent the whole afternoon together,

02:15.834 --> 02:18.233
and he didn't ask you out?
What did you do wrong?

02:18.500 --> 02:21.200
-Who didn't ask you out, Dorothy?
-You got a phone book?

02:22.533 --> 02:25.900
Frank Leahy. You know, the teacher
I've been working on the youth fair.

02:25.967 --> 02:28.900
She's known him for two whole weeks.
And he hasn't asked her out yet.

02:28.967 --> 02:31.500
Look, I don't "know him" know him.

02:31.567 --> 02:34.233
We've spent exactly
two Saturday mornings

02:34.300 --> 02:36.834
building display booths
and painting signs.

02:36.900 --> 02:38.133
We're hardly close.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.367
Maybe you could be if you'd ask him out?
He's obviously too shy to ask you.

02:42.734 --> 02:44.300
Maybe he just doesn't like her.

02:51.333 --> 02:52.400
Thank you, Rose.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.333
Incidentally, you look fat.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.900
Well, I say the time
for subtlety has passed.

03:01.967 --> 03:03.834
If you want this man,
go after him. Ask him out.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.834
Oh, I don't know.

03:05.900 --> 03:09.300
I feel so awkward
asking a man out on a date.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.233
Well, you could always invite
him here to dinner.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.433
That wouldn't seem as pushy.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.367
Oh, that's a great idea, Rose.
Then we'll all check him out.

03:15.433 --> 03:18.700
-I don't think I can do it.
-Oh, Dorothy, of course you can.

03:18.767 --> 03:21.734
Look here, now, you be Frank,
I'll be you, okay?

03:23.400 --> 03:24.400
Why, Frank...

03:25.467 --> 03:27.133
You know, I've been thinking.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.400
This is the third Saturday
of our relationship,

03:29.467 --> 03:31.800
and I don't even know
what you like to eat.

03:32.266 --> 03:34.667
Why don't you come over
for dinner this Saturday night

03:34.734 --> 03:39.200
and let me find out
what whets your appetite.

03:47.700 --> 03:50.834
And what are you serving for dessert,
Blanche, penicillin?

03:53.433 --> 03:54.967
I'll do it my own way.

03:55.033 --> 03:58.166
If you do it your way,
you better use Jane Fonda's body.

03:58.233 --> 04:00.633
Otherwise,
it'll be just the four of us for dinner.

04:29.266 --> 04:30.333
Frank.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.266
Friend.

04:33.633 --> 04:35.700
I'm sorry, I was just going to say

04:35.767 --> 04:38.433
that the sign seemed a little
high on one side.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.867
-How about coffee break?
-Ah, sure.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.834
Hey, Tony, when one
of you guys gets the chance,

04:44.900 --> 04:46.133
will you fix that sign.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.033
It seems a little high on one side.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.066
Yeah, sure, Frank.

04:50.633 --> 04:54.233
You know, I notice a lot of your
students call you Frank.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.533
-You don't approve?
-Oh, no, on the contrary.

04:56.600 --> 05:00.834
I think anything other than "yo, teach"
is an educational breakthrough.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.934
I just think that formal titles
can be very intimidating.

05:04.367 --> 05:07.834
-This way, I'm just one of the guys.
-You think a lot of these kids, don't you?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.100
Ah, hey, so do you.

05:09.166 --> 05:13.700
Well, I do but, I don't know,
I sense a special dedication from you.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.500
-It's nice.
-Well, thanks, Dorothy.

05:15.567 --> 05:17.166
You know, I've been at this a long time.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.967
I watch these kids grow.
I know their families.

05:20.033 --> 05:23.533
-I've been to their homes for dinner.
-Really?

05:24.000 --> 05:27.266
Well, of course, they spread
a newspaper on the floor for me.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.333
Frank.

05:28.400 --> 05:29.934
Come on, I'm kidding,
you seem so amazed.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.800
No, I'm not amazed, I just mean,
I think it's nice that you do that.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.233
Funny, I just assumed that you
knew that I eat dinner.

05:38.533 --> 05:42.266
I meant, I think it's nice
that you go to people's homes for dinner.

05:42.567 --> 05:45.100
How would you like to go home with me?
I mean, for dinner.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.567
You know, maybe next week.
My roommates would love to meet you.

05:48.633 --> 05:51.400
-Sure, what's a good night?
-Ah, bingo night.

05:51.467 --> 05:53.967
Any other time I'd have
to introduce you to my mother.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.033
But I still don't understand.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.100
The table looked right
where we always keep it.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.633
Honey, the table looked fine
but with her complexion

06:06.700 --> 06:09.867
those yellow garden lights make Dorothy
look like Eric Sevareid.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.934
Look out, St. Dominic's.
Sophia Petrillo feels lucky tonight.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.467
Oh, right. Tonight's
the big bingo game, isn't it?

06:17.533 --> 06:20.266
The biggest. I got my lucky handkerchief.
I can't lose.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.133
-Where did you find it?
-In my bra.

06:24.867 --> 06:28.166
Your bra? What was your lucky
handkerchief doing in there?

06:28.233 --> 06:30.400
I was blowing my breasts, Rose.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.834
I stuffed it in to give me cleavage.

06:39.333 --> 06:42.100
To turn on the butcher
so I could get a decent piece of veal.

06:43.567 --> 06:47.433
Now, if you'll excuse me, there's an
electric weed whacker at St. Dominic's

06:47.500 --> 06:48.567
with my name on it.

06:51.934 --> 06:55.934
Rose, when we eat dinner,
we'll sit on the far side of the table.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.266
-And I'll sit next to you.
-Why?

06:58.800 --> 07:00.867
Just in case somebody
wants to play footsie.

07:00.934 --> 07:05.066
Gee, that sounds like fun.
I haven't played footsie in years.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.567
-Charlie never wanted to--
-Rose,

07:07.633 --> 07:09.667
Frank and Dorothy might want
to play footsie.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.633
Oh. Oh!

07:14.300 --> 07:16.767
-How do I look?
-Beautiful.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.667
Go back and change.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.967
That outfit might be fine
for a gay funeral in New Orleans,

07:23.033 --> 07:26.767
but it's much too subtle for this evening.

07:26.834 --> 07:30.433
Dorothy, put on something flashy,
something colorful.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.700
-That's really not me, Blanche.
-I know, honey, but take a chance.

07:34.767 --> 07:35.834
Be a woman!

07:36.734 --> 07:40.934
-That's a lot to ask, but I'll try.
-Good. Go on.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.934
Rose, let's go see about supper.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.200
Blanche, don't you think you're pushing
Dorothy a little hard?

07:50.266 --> 07:53.567
No. She needs all our help.
She needs all your help too.

07:53.633 --> 07:57.367
She won't have too many chances.
She doesn't have my beauty or your...

08:04.066 --> 08:05.266
we'll help you next week.

08:08.200 --> 08:12.000
The point is she practically glows
every time she speaks his name.

08:12.066 --> 08:13.834
Dorothy's in love?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.033
Well, she's definitely smitten.

08:16.433 --> 08:20.633
With a little help from us, she can fire
cupid's arrow into the tushy of love.

08:22.133 --> 08:24.000
The tushy of love?

08:25.500 --> 08:28.233
For some strange reason,
I find that provocative.

08:29.700 --> 08:31.500
You really ought to date more, Rose.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.133
-(doorbell rings)
-That's him.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.467
Heat up the rolls
and cool yourself down.

08:41.867 --> 08:42.867
Good evening.

08:56.934 --> 09:00.133
Good evening, father. My, my,
this must be an important cause.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.333
Don't you usually make
the nuns ask for money?

09:03.867 --> 09:08.066
-I'll get my purse.
-I'm Frank. I'm here to see Dorothy.

09:12.834 --> 09:13.834
You're the hunk?

09:16.433 --> 09:20.600
I mean, forgive me, father.
That is, forgive my language.

09:21.667 --> 09:25.467
Not in your official capacity.
I'm not even a catholic.

09:25.934 --> 09:28.700
I'm a Baptist,
and you can't forgive us Baptists.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.333
Sweet Jesus, why am I babbling?

09:40.600 --> 09:45.266
I meant that in all due reverence.
I never take the lord's name in vain.

09:46.066 --> 09:47.934
Oh, God, now I'm lying to a priest.

09:52.533 --> 09:54.567
Come in and sit down.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.633
I'm Blanche, Dorothy's roommate.
Would you get the door?

10:00.700 --> 10:02.200
Dorothy's told me a great deal about you.

10:02.266 --> 10:05.700
Well, she left out one itty-bitty detail
about you.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.300
-That I'm a priest?
-Uh-huh.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.400
She didn't know.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.467
What did she think,
you were just a boring dresser?

10:15.900 --> 10:17.900
She's never seen me
in cleric's clothing.

10:17.967 --> 10:20.433
I didn't know you priests could take
your clothes off.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.667
We do a lot of things real people do.

10:26.734 --> 10:28.800
Except for one very important thing.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.333
Boy, is that gonna put a hitch
in Dorothy's plans.

10:37.033 --> 10:40.467
Hello. I'm Rose Nylund.
You must be Frank.

10:40.533 --> 10:44.367
-It's a pleasure meeting you.
-It's nice meeting you, too.

10:44.433 --> 10:47.300
-Dorothy's talked about you for weeks.
-Rose.

10:47.367 --> 10:50.166
Whenever she mentions your name,
she glows.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.567
-Rose.
-She's very smitten with you.

10:52.633 --> 10:53.834
Rose!

10:54.834 --> 10:56.834
-He's a priest, isn't he?
-Yes, Rose.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.600
I'm so sorry Hell Town was canceled.

11:11.133 --> 11:13.800
Frank, I'm sorry I kept...

11:15.633 --> 11:17.533
please tell me that's a Nehru jacket.

11:19.700 --> 11:20.700
No, it's not.

11:20.767 --> 11:24.166
Rose, let's go heat up the lasagna.
Come on.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.500
Why didn't you tell me
it was "father" Leahy?

11:31.567 --> 11:34.033
-I assumed you knew.
-No, I didn't.

11:34.667 --> 11:35.667
I mean...

11:36.133 --> 11:40.567
-frankly, I'm a little embarrassed.
-Me too.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.700
What difference does it make?
Can't we still be friends?

11:44.767 --> 11:48.367
Of course. I'm glad you're here.

11:49.300 --> 11:50.367
So am I.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.100
You look lovely tonight.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.867
I look like the mother
of a <i>Solid Gold</i> dancer.

12:03.533 --> 12:07.533
Look... Dorothy, I'm sorry about
this misunderstanding.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.700
I know. I know. It's all right.

12:10.166 --> 12:13.300
Ok, everybody. We're ready
to serve the appetizers.

12:13.367 --> 12:16.500
Frank, we're eating
out on the lanai.

12:22.266 --> 12:25.834
-Where am I supposed to sit?
-Anywhere you damn well please.

12:25.900 --> 12:27.600
What the hell difference does it make now?

12:35.800 --> 12:39.567
You were a teacher,
then you decided to become a priest.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.100
First I went to medical school.

12:42.633 --> 12:45.400
Then I quit and became a basketball coach.

12:45.734 --> 12:48.367
Then I became a teacher.
Then came the priesthood.

12:48.433 --> 12:50.100
What will you do next?

12:53.667 --> 12:56.767
Would anybody care for more coffee?
I have another pot brewing.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.300
Let me help you, Dorothy. Excuse me.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.700
You know, black is your color.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.500
Did that influence your decision
to enter the priesthood?

13:09.934 --> 13:14.433
It wasn't the evening I'd planned,
but it's turned out pleasant enough.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.800
-Frank's a special person, isn't he?
-Yes, he certainly is.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.033
He thinks the same about you.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.367
Of course he does. We're friends.

13:23.834 --> 13:27.233
I hesitate to say this,
but something in Frank's eyes

13:27.300 --> 13:30.700
says he sees you as more than a friend.

13:30.767 --> 13:33.767
-The man is a priest.
-The man's a man.

13:35.533 --> 13:36.934
I won't listen to this.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.567
I was in a very similar position once,
and he was a man of the cloth.

13:41.633 --> 13:44.700
Totally dedicated
to his vocation, so he said.

13:44.967 --> 13:47.800
His eyes told me he was dedicated to me.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.834
We both knew it was wrong.

13:49.900 --> 13:55.367
We fought our feelings with every bone
in our hot, longing, writhing bodies.

13:56.834 --> 13:59.100
But finally it was too much for us.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.700
We gave up and checked
into a best western.

14:04.867 --> 14:07.133
You had an affair with a priest?

14:07.200 --> 14:11.367
Not a priest. A man of the cloth.
He was a fabric salesman.

14:13.767 --> 14:17.567
We never made love again.
He covered my la-z-boy for free.

14:18.300 --> 14:20.066
Wonderful, Blanche.

14:20.133 --> 14:24.400
His eyes say he wants you,
in the biblical sense.

14:24.467 --> 14:26.133
I will not listen to this.

14:27.734 --> 14:28.834
Coffee's ready.

14:34.033 --> 14:39.133
-Ma, your bingo game's over already?
-It wasn't a game. It was a travesty.

14:39.467 --> 14:43.133
Four lousy numbers and boom,
Gloria Rossi wins.

14:43.200 --> 14:46.533
Six more numbers,
Cele Kessler's jumping around shouting,

14:46.600 --> 14:47.767
"I'm rich! I'm rich!"

14:48.467 --> 14:52.066
She also does this Thursdays
on the boardwalk to attract men.

14:52.967 --> 14:55.133
Frankly, I think
the whole thing was fixed.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.467
That's why I told father Donatelli
I'm asking Hugh Downs to investigate.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.967
I guess they sent you over to shut me up.

15:07.667 --> 15:11.333
Ma, this is father Leahy.
He had dinner with us.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.000
Pleased to meet you.
What happened to your date?

15:16.200 --> 15:17.734
Father Leahy is her date.

15:20.066 --> 15:21.166
Come here.

15:29.166 --> 15:32.033
Dorothy, sometimes a mother
gets a little busy

15:32.100 --> 15:34.667
and forgets to tell her daughter
everything she needs to know.

15:37.100 --> 15:40.700
So I'm telling you now,
don't date a priest. It's bad luck.

15:42.266 --> 15:43.934
-Ma--
-Trust me on this one.

15:44.233 --> 15:47.633
What happened to me at bingo
was no accident.

15:49.433 --> 15:53.266
Oh, I didn't realize how late it was.
I really should be going.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.166
Thank you all.
I had a wonderful time.

15:56.233 --> 16:00.900
-I'll see you Saturday.
-Let's have dinner before that.

16:00.967 --> 16:02.567
There's something
I want to discuss with you.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.700
-Sure. What?
-Thanks to you,

16:04.767 --> 16:07.233
I'm on the verge of an important decision.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.200
I may leave the church.

16:11.166 --> 16:12.367
Good night.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.200
I thought I heard you up.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.033
I couldn't sleep.
I had a horrible nightmare.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.233
Oh, well, tell it to me,
I'm awfully good at interpreting dreams.

16:36.233 --> 16:38.567
I was a contestant on <i>The Dating Game...</i>

16:39.033 --> 16:40.033
and I won.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.600
I went around the corner to meet
the bachelor that picked me.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.867
And it was the pope.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.867
Boy, that is a tough one.
Ah, where did you go on the date?

16:52.934 --> 16:56.200
Oh, forget it, forget it. Good night.

16:57.667 --> 17:01.533
-Rose, I thought you were asleep.
-I got provisions.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.000
-We'll be talking all night.
-Good night.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.200
She won't talk.

17:06.266 --> 17:11.367
But I've got chocolate macadamia nut
cheesecake and rum raisin ice cream.

17:11.433 --> 17:15.533
-Oh, ok. Start cutting. You scoop.
-Ah, that's my girl.

17:17.767 --> 17:20.567
-Did you decide what you're going to do?
-No.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.467
My luck. The first wonderful guy
I've met in a long time

17:26.533 --> 17:29.166
turns out to have
a more serious involvement.

17:29.233 --> 17:31.033
-With whom?
-Pam Dawber!

17:32.700 --> 17:33.934
The church.

17:34.633 --> 17:39.767
-That is, until he met me.
-It's really quite romantic,

17:39.834 --> 17:42.100
a man giving up
everything for the woman he loves,

17:42.166 --> 17:44.300
like the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.166
Or the story of Rose and Charlie Nyland.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.333
You know, when I think of one,
I automatically think of the other.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.433
When we started dating, I felt that
Charlie's folks didn't like me.

17:58.934 --> 18:01.400
I decided to find out what was wrong,

18:01.467 --> 18:03.800
and I found out
about the ancient feud

18:03.867 --> 18:06.633
between the Nylunds
and the Gerkleknerbigens.

18:08.734 --> 18:10.200
That was my mother's maiden name.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.633
Gerkleknerbigen?

18:12.700 --> 18:15.633
Originally, it was
Gerkleknerbigen Hoffstettlerfrau...

18:17.200 --> 18:18.266
but they shortened it

18:18.333 --> 18:20.834
because most of my mother's family
were in show business.

18:24.567 --> 18:29.300
When Charlie told them we were getting
married, they forbade it.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.600
They said they'd disown him
if he married a...

18:31.667 --> 18:33.000
-Gerkleknerbigen.
-Gerkleknerbigen.

18:33.066 --> 18:34.433
Right.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.867
And he'd lose his share
of the family tile grout fortune.

18:40.266 --> 18:41.400
But he didn't care.

18:41.967 --> 18:44.500
He told them he loved
me more than grout.

18:46.467 --> 18:48.667
It must've been a tough
choice for Charlie.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.433
I thought I heard voices.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.667
Now I see that
only two are god-fearing.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.934
Ma, get off my back.
I feel bad enough.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.467
You? What about me?

19:00.767 --> 19:03.100
Eighty one years
I've eaten fish on Friday,

19:03.166 --> 19:04.967
even when the Pope told me
I didn't have to.

19:05.433 --> 19:09.133
I go to mass, I say novenas. And for what?

19:09.200 --> 19:10.734
So we could be
flushed down the toilet

19:10.800 --> 19:14.000
because my daughter insists
on dating father happy pants.

19:17.467 --> 19:19.667
Ma, you're not making it any easier.

19:19.734 --> 19:24.166
Dorothy, in the end
only you can decide what's right for you.

19:24.233 --> 19:27.066
Whatever decision it is, I'll stand by it.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.266
Thanks, ma.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.867
Just remember,
make the wrong decision,

19:31.934 --> 19:33.533
you'll burn in hell forever.

19:37.967 --> 19:39.333
Sleep tight, pussycat.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.734
I'm not here to confess.
I did that already.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.633
At my age, how much can I sin?

20:11.467 --> 20:14.867
What, I had an impure thought?
I'd kill for an impure thought.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.033
That would be two sins.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.767
But now I'm telling you your business.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.166
Here's the point of my visit.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.133
It's about you and my daughter.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.800
I know everything,
and, frankly, I'm not thrilled.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.233
But if you want
to leave the priesthood,

20:33.300 --> 20:34.767
that's between you and the Vatican.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.300
But you should know some
things about Dorothy.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.367
Frank, have you decided?

20:40.834 --> 20:45.166
I can serve the church better
as a teaching priest at St. Helen's

20:45.233 --> 20:47.033
instead of a parish priest here.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.367
Well, we'll miss you around here.

20:50.433 --> 20:53.367
I know priests are men
and they have urges.

20:53.633 --> 20:55.767
What is it, lust? It'll pass.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.934
I do without. You get used to it.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.600
Get cable TV.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.066
-Lots of luck.
-Thanks.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.300
Frank.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.133
Dorothy, why are you here?

21:10.600 --> 21:12.934
I have some free time between classes.

21:13.000 --> 21:17.400
-You drove 18 miles across town?
-Ok, I wanted to talk.

21:17.467 --> 21:19.500
I couldn't wait until Thursday.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.166
The thought that
I might be responsible

21:24.233 --> 21:26.500
for the decision
you're making was too much.

21:26.867 --> 21:30.533
You didn't push me towards
this decision.

21:30.867 --> 21:32.300
You didn't know I was thinking about it.

21:32.367 --> 21:35.367
Blanche did. She saw it in your eyes.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.333
My eyes?

21:37.400 --> 21:41.333
Frank, you're very special.
I knew that the moment we met.

21:41.400 --> 21:46.667
You felt the same about me.
That's very flattering to me.

21:46.734 --> 21:50.467
At this stage of a woman's life,

21:50.533 --> 21:55.767
to have someone instantly feel
that spark for her is a dream come true.

21:55.834 --> 21:58.767
All right. Maybe in the dream
he wouldn't be a priest...

22:00.066 --> 22:02.233
but that doesn't make it
any less flattering.

22:02.900 --> 22:05.100
But it does make it more complicated.

22:06.300 --> 22:09.567
So, Frank, you cannot
go through with this.

22:09.633 --> 22:12.567
-Dorothy--
-No. It's a mistake

22:12.633 --> 22:16.533
that we'd both regret
for the rest of our lives.

22:16.600 --> 22:21.166
No matter how strongly you feel,
don't leave the priesthood for me.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.567
What?

22:24.400 --> 22:28.333
-I understand how hurt you must feel.
-(laughs)

22:28.400 --> 22:30.667
All right.
Maybe I don't understand exactly.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.100
I'm sorry, Dorothy,

22:34.166 --> 22:37.767
but our relationship seems to be one
misunderstanding after another.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.834
-Misunderstanding?
-I'm not leaving the priesthood.

22:41.433 --> 22:43.867
-I'm leaving the church.
-This church.

22:46.367 --> 22:50.266
Well... if you're not
leaving the priesthood...

22:50.867 --> 22:53.567
then I just made an ass of myself.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.367
Excuse my language, father,
but as an English teacher,

22:57.433 --> 23:01.433
-that's the most appropriate description.
-No, it's not.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.533
How can you say that?

23:03.600 --> 23:06.967
I created an entire relationship
in my imagination.

23:07.033 --> 23:11.500
It wasn't in your imagination.
There is something special between us.

23:11.834 --> 23:13.133
We appreciate each other.

23:13.200 --> 23:16.000
You helped me see where I could
do the most good...

23:16.633 --> 23:18.300
as a teaching priest.

23:18.867 --> 23:23.467
Well, it's taken me a little while,
but I've got it.

23:24.066 --> 23:27.600
Listen, your silence is deafening.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.333
I didn't want to whip this one out,
but I have no choice.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.333
She's been divorced.

23:32.867 --> 23:34.133
You know the rule book.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.000
We're talking eternity here.

23:37.934 --> 23:40.133
Then we're still
having dinner Thursday?

23:40.200 --> 23:44.934
Yes, but just so we don't have another
misunderstanding, who is buying?

23:45.500 --> 23:48.900
-How about Dutch treat?
-Great. I'll see you Thursday.

23:50.867 --> 23:51.867
Dorothy.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.200
Thanks.

24:04.166 --> 24:06.433
It's like you didn't hear a word I said.

24:15.533 --> 24:21.667
(theme music playing)
