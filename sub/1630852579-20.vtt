NARRATOR:
More than 5,000 years ago,

00:04.713 --> 00:08.433
Egypt gave rise to
the world’s first great empire,

00:08.550 --> 00:11.970
and in the 20th century,
a mysterious woman

Omm Sety was one of
the most remarkable women

of the 20th century--

00:22.564 --> 00:25.614
She moved modern archaeology
along enormously.

She claimed to be
the reincarnation

00:28.362 --> 00:30.162
of a priestess.

ANDREW COLLINS: Omm Sety
had an incredible insight

into ancient Egypt in a way
which went beyond the norm.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.826

astonished archaeologists

00:40.916 --> 00:43.286

KATHLEEN McGOWAN: They’re
fond of saying in Abydos

00:44.962 --> 00:47.592
that Omm Sety was never wrong.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.134
And she was not.

00:49.258 --> 00:52.048

But was Omm Sety being directed

00:52.135 --> 00:53.965

Perhaps one
of otherworldly origin?

that when she hit her head
falling down the stairs

or speak a language that
they’d never spoken before,

or have some sort of skill that
seemingly came out of nowhere.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.958

because of the fall

09:03.084 --> 09:06.464
that Dorothy endured
that this is what happened.

09:06.588 --> 09:11.128
She had something unlocked
in her brain and all of a sudden

09:11.259 --> 09:15.139
she can actually tap into
a past life experience.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.893
NARRATOR:
Reincarnation is defined
as the rebirth of a soul

09:18.975 --> 09:22.475

and from an early age,

09:22.604 --> 09:26.734
Dorothy Eady sensed she had
lived a past life in Abydos.

09:26.816 --> 09:31.026
While many in the West view
reincarnation with skepticism,

09:31.112 --> 09:34.122
numerous cultures,
both past and present,

09:34.199 --> 09:37.289
consider it an integral
part of their belief system--

09:37.410 --> 09:41.160
and ancient Egypt
was no exception.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.209
In ancient Egyptian religion
there was a great emphasis

09:45.293 --> 09:47.003
on the next life, the afterlife.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.668
The ancient Egyptians did

that the soul
appeared many times.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.309
from a past life,
but she herself claimed

10:02.393 --> 10:05.233
that much of her knowledge
was given to her by figures

10:05.313 --> 10:07.613
she encountered in the night.

10:07.690 --> 10:11.030
Figures that came to her
from the distant past--

10:11.152 --> 10:13.822
and some that came
from the stars.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.147
Well, there had to
be something there

10:51.234 --> 10:53.364
that was
absolutely extraordinary.

10:53.444 --> 10:57.374
PICKNETT:
This tiny child
just knew everything.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.988
She took to Egyptian
hieroglyphics

10:59.075 --> 11:00.695
very readily.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.655
Um, and sort of almost
paranormally swiftly.

11:02.745 --> 11:07.035
NARRATOR:
With over 1,000
distinct characters,

11:07.125 --> 11:11.425
hieroglyphic writing takes
modern scholars years to master.

11:11.546 --> 11:15.876
Did Dorothy Eady simply have
an unusual aptitude

11:15.967 --> 11:18.887
for mastering a
complicated writing system?

11:18.970 --> 11:21.560
Or is there another explanation?

11:21.639 --> 11:27.809
Years later, Dorothy would
answer that question herself.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.896
At the age of 27,
Dorothy Eady takes a job

11:35.987 --> 11:39.067
with a political journal
advocating for

11:39.199 --> 11:42.409
greater Egyptian independence
from Great Britain.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.043
The British had had

11:44.120 --> 11:46.580
control over Egypt
for quite a long time.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.464
And there was a
semi-independence,

11:49.584 --> 11:51.754
but-but still not independence.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.756
So, Dorothy was
headlong into that.

11:54.839 --> 12:00.889
RAMY ROMANY:
At that time, there was a
crazy Egyptian Egyptomania

12:00.970 --> 12:02.930
presence around the world.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.934
Dorothy was ahead of them.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.766
She was already
obsessed with Egypt.

12:06.851 --> 12:10.441
She started working
at an Egyptian

12:10.521 --> 12:14.361
PR relations magazine in London.

12:14.442 --> 12:17.112
And that’s when she met
Eman Abdel Meguid.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.285
He was a student at the time.

12:19.364 --> 12:25.954
DEES:
Eman was a young Egyptian man
studying to be a teacher.

12:26.037 --> 12:29.367
And Eman fell head
over heels in love with this

12:29.457 --> 12:34.297
energetic, passionate woman.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.917
And when he had to
go back to Egypt,

12:39.008 --> 12:43.348

19:07.772 --> 19:09.312
according to the

Abydos was that
for the ancient Egyptians

20:00.783 --> 20:03.623
as Varanasi is for
the Hindu in India,

20:03.744 --> 20:06.584
Jerusalem for the Jews,
Mecca for Islam.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.214
These places change you.

NARRATOR:
According to
Egypt’s Pyramid Texts,

20:12.920 --> 20:16.220
the gods Osiris and Isis
came to Earth

20:16.298 --> 20:18.428
from their home in the stars
of Orion’s Belt.

20:18.509 --> 20:22.099
Is it more than mere coincidence

20:22.221 --> 20:24.771
that Omm Sety was drawn
to Abydos--

20:24.890 --> 20:28.060
the place where Egypt’s most
important gods were worshipped?

20:28.144 --> 20:31.944

CHILDRESS:
When you look back at
ancient Egyptian history

to educate the Egyptians

20:46.162 --> 20:51.292
who have power and very
high-tech means to do things,

20:51.375 --> 20:55.085
including building the pyramids
and raising obelisks,

20:55.171 --> 20:59.091
moving stones that weigh
hundreds of tons.

20:59.175 --> 21:03.265
It would seem like
they’re extraterrestrials.

21:03.345 --> 21:06.265
And so, that Omm Sety was
living in Abydos is significant.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.808
NARRATOR:
With decades of experience
assisting Egyptologists

21:10.936 --> 21:13.766
in Cairo, 47-year-old Omm Sety

21:13.856 --> 21:16.396
seeks out Edouard Ghazouli,

21:16.484 --> 21:19.404
the man in charge of
excavating the ruins

21:19.487 --> 21:22.987
of the Temple of Seti I,
which is in shambles.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.285
Having heard of
Omm Sety’s uncanny knowledge,

21:26.368 --> 21:29.958
Ghazouli devises a test,

21:30.039 --> 21:32.619
asking her to find specific
locations and carvings within

21:32.708 --> 21:36.628
the temple that he and his
team have just discovered.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.462
-Long time, no see!
-Hello, Omm Sety.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.337
-Don’t get up.
-How are you?

21:40.424 --> 21:43.344
NARRATOR: Omm Sety herself
described this test

21:43.427 --> 21:46.007
in a 1981 BBC documentary

21:46.096 --> 21:49.516
called <i>Omm Seti and Her Egypt.</i>

21:49.600 --> 21:52.810
They said that
they would test me.

21:52.895 --> 21:55.485
The first time I went in,
they told me where to go.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.614
It was the chapel of Amun.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.822
So, I went right in,
and they told me to go

22:01.904 --> 22:05.664
in front of the scene of
the sacred boats, which I did.

22:05.741 --> 22:06.991
Called out.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.236
They came, they found me

22:08.369 --> 22:09.999
where I was supposed to be.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.119
They said, "Ah,
that’s just chance."

22:12.206 --> 22:14.326
I said, "Well, try again."

22:14.416 --> 22:15.706
Well, they tried several times,

22:15.835 --> 22:18.675
and each time,
I was in the right place.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.924
It was as if I walked in...

22:21.048 --> 22:26.508
into a place where I had lived
before and knew all about it.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.308
INTERVIEWER:
Did you recognize anybody

22:29.390 --> 22:30.810
from the reliefs?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.521
SETY:
Oh, Seti!

22:32.601 --> 22:35.731
The King Seti.
I had known him.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.027
NARRATOR: The archaeologists
on-site were astounded

22:40.109 --> 22:42.399
by Omm Sety’s
unexplainable knowledge.

22:42.528 --> 22:46.318
But what left them
truly stunned was her revelation

22:46.407 --> 22:49.697
of a temple garden
that no one knew existed.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.535
CHILDRESS:
She asked them,

22:51.620 --> 22:54.580
where is this garden that she
was very familiar with?

22:54.665 --> 22:58.965
And the archeologists said,
"Well, there’s no garden here."

22:59.086 --> 23:01.376
TSOUKALOS: And she said,
"It’s over there, just go dig."

23:01.463 --> 23:03.133
And the head excavator says,

23:03.257 --> 23:05.377
"We know for a fact there’s
no garden over there."

23:05.467 --> 23:09.427
And she says, "Yes, yes,
there is, please just do it."

23:09.513 --> 23:13.853
And they started digging,
and they found the garden.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.524
So, it’s stuff like that--

23:15.603 --> 23:17.983
just speaking right now,
I have goose bumps,

23:18.105 --> 23:20.145
because stuff like that
shouldn’t happen.

23:22.192 --> 23:25.322
NARRATOR:
Omm Sety remained at the temple
for the rest of her life,

23:25.446 --> 23:28.236
helping to uncover
artifacts known to her

23:28.324 --> 23:30.374
not only from
her past life memories,

23:30.451 --> 23:33.911
but also from
the visitors she continued

23:33.996 --> 23:35.656
to encounter in her dreams.

23:35.789 --> 23:38.289
While these
dream-state encounters

23:38.375 --> 23:41.415
were regarded with skepticism
in the 20th century,

23:41.503 --> 23:44.213
in ancient Egypt,
they were not uncommon.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.588
One of the key
aspects of Omm Sety’s story

23:46.675 --> 23:50.005
is the dream conduit
that she opened up

23:50.137 --> 23:52.217
to receive knowledge
and also to connect with

23:52.306 --> 23:53.806
these otherworldly beings.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.061
This is something
that’s very important

23:56.143 --> 23:57.313
to the ancient Egyptians.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.607
NARRATOR:
In the ancient world,
there was a religious practice

24:01.690 --> 24:04.150
often referred to as
"incubation,"

24:04.276 --> 24:07.276
which involved
sleeping in a sacred area

24:07.363 --> 24:09.033
with the intention of
experiencing

24:09.156 --> 24:10.986
a divinely inspired dream.

24:11.116 --> 24:15.536
Stories of sleep incubation can
be found in the Hebrew Bible,

24:15.663 --> 24:18.753
in ancient Greece,
and perhaps most commonly

24:18.832 --> 24:20.632
in ancient Egypt.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.339
HENRY:
There’s story after story
of people coming,

24:23.462 --> 24:25.092
for example, to Saqqara,

24:25.172 --> 24:27.672
which was a
dream incubation center.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.430
People would come to Saqqara,
go into a dream,

24:30.511 --> 24:32.681
and have an experience
with the god Ptah

24:32.763 --> 24:34.763
or a healing entity,
and be cured of

24:34.848 --> 24:36.678
whatever that malady was.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.646
PICKNETT:
Going back to
Pharaoh Seti the first,

24:40.729 --> 24:42.939
he depended upon dreams.

24:43.023 --> 24:46.943
He had a dream that
informed him where to dig

24:47.027 --> 24:50.777
to find the-- what was
already ancient Osirion.

24:51.782 --> 24:55.662
So, it was not unknown
for the ancient Egyptians,

24:55.744 --> 24:58.834
to use dreams
in a very practical way.

25:00.040 --> 25:02.210
NARRATOR:
According to Omm Sety,

25:02.292 --> 25:05.172
after she moved to Abydos,
Pharaoh Seti--

25:05.254 --> 25:07.134
who had been visiting her
in the night--

25:07.214 --> 25:10.054
began to appear to her
even when she was not asleep

25:10.134 --> 25:13.224
or in a meditative state.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.425
CHILDRESS:
People would allegedly see

25:16.557 --> 25:18.347
him in her room

25:18.434 --> 25:20.854
as a physical person.

25:20.936 --> 25:22.226
So, how could this be?

25:22.312 --> 25:25.572
Is he an extraterrestrial

25:25.649 --> 25:27.779
who is able to travel
through different dimensions

25:27.901 --> 25:29.951
and to different times?

25:30.070 --> 25:33.320
NARRATOR:
If the figure that
appeared to Omm Sety

25:33.407 --> 25:36.577
as the Pharaoh Seti
was an extraterrestrial,

25:36.660 --> 25:41.460
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest, what was his agenda?

25:42.708 --> 25:46.208
Perhaps further clues can
be found by taking a closer look

25:46.295 --> 25:49.425
at the life of
this mysterious pharaoh.

25:56.680 --> 26:00.520
NARRATOR:
Thebes, Egypt. 1290 BC.

26:01.393 --> 26:05.193
The elderly
King Rameses I passes away

26:05.272 --> 26:07.772
after a reign of just 16 months,

26:07.900 --> 26:12.490
and his son Seti is announced
as the new pharaoh.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.663
Egypt is in a period of chaos,

26:14.782 --> 26:17.282
and Pharaoh Seti
believes the only way

26:17.409 --> 26:21.659
to save it is to restore
the power of the old gods.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.249
Pharaoh Seti is one of
the most important characters

26:24.333 --> 26:25.713
in Egyptian history.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.593
And one of Seti’s
most important objectives

26:29.671 --> 26:32.631
as pharaoh was to
bring back the old gods,

26:32.716 --> 26:35.966
to bring back
the power of the old gods,

26:36.053 --> 26:39.473
the understanding of
the importance of Osiris.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.638
One of the things
that he does as part of

26:41.767 --> 26:43.887
that restoration of
the old ways

26:43.977 --> 26:47.517
to the multiple gods
is go to Abydos,

26:47.648 --> 26:51.778
builds the temple there with
lots of different side temples

26:51.860 --> 26:54.950
that are there to worship these
different gods and goddesses.

26:55.030 --> 26:58.280
NARRATOR:
In Abydos, Seti built
one of the most

26:58.367 --> 27:00.327
magnificent temples
in all of Egypt,

27:00.452 --> 27:05.082
containing seven chapels
dedicated to different gods.

27:06.875 --> 27:12.255
But when Omm Sety arrived in
Abydos in 1951, the great temple

27:12.339 --> 27:15.839
she claimed to have known in
her past life was all but gone.

27:18.011 --> 27:21.141
HENRY:
There was around
2,500 pieces of the temple

27:21.223 --> 27:23.223
scattered everywhere,

27:23.350 --> 27:25.230
and Ghazouli and others
had no idea

27:25.352 --> 27:27.522
how to fit these pieces
back together.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.356
But Omm Sety, maintaining that
she had this past life memory,

27:31.441 --> 27:33.821
could tell them, "Oh,
this piece would go here.

27:33.902 --> 27:37.322
This piece would go there. I
remember it looking like this."

27:40.159 --> 27:42.659
TSOUKALOS:
This was an incredibly
daunting task.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.164
But she started each day

27:44.246 --> 27:47.746
with unbridled passion
and enthusiasm.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.385
And Abydos was reconstructed,

27:50.502 --> 27:55.172
according to
Omm Sety’s instructions.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.760
McGOWAN:
She solves the amazing
jigsaw puzzle,

27:58.886 --> 28:01.256
putting together
these 2,500 pieces

28:01.388 --> 28:04.518
and restoring the Temple of
Abydos in two and a half years,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.600
which is absolutely impossible

28:06.727 --> 28:09.397
without her extraordinary
understanding of the temple.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.731
It would have taken
20 years for anybody else

28:11.857 --> 28:13.897
to do the work that she did
in two and a half years.

28:15.402 --> 28:19.742
NARRATOR:
According to Omm Sety,
restoring the temple at Abydos

28:19.865 --> 28:23.285
was about much more than
just resurrecting the past.

28:24.203 --> 28:27.123
To her closest friends,
she confided that

28:27.247 --> 28:32.287
this ancient structure served
an extraordinary purpose.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.299
Omm Sety would actually
state that

28:34.421 --> 28:38.631
the Temple of Abydos served as
a star gate of sorts,

28:38.759 --> 28:40.969
a place where you were able to

28:41.094 --> 28:43.854
jump in and out of
time and space.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.144
NARRATOR:
A star gate?

28:48.268 --> 28:51.808
Could the Temple of Abydos
have acted as a portal

28:51.939 --> 28:53.939
to other points in the universe?

28:54.066 --> 28:57.236
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

28:57.319 --> 29:01.659
a feature inside the temple
supports this sensational claim.

29:01.782 --> 29:06.292
They point to a bell-shaped
object painted on a chapel wall

29:06.370 --> 29:09.330
that some refer to as
the Osiris Device.

29:09.456 --> 29:11.956
HENRY:
When we look at this symbol
through modern eyes,

29:12.042 --> 29:13.632
it’s highly technological.

29:13.710 --> 29:15.840
To the eyes of
a physicist or an engineer,

29:15.963 --> 29:18.053
it looks like a Tesla coil.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.181
And you wonder,
what could an image

29:20.300 --> 29:21.970
that resembles a Tesla coil

29:22.094 --> 29:26.224
be doing on the walls of
a temple that’s 3,500 years old?

29:26.306 --> 29:31.056
NARRATOR:
The Tesla coil was designed
in the late 1800s

29:31.144 --> 29:32.734
by inventor Nikola Tesla

29:32.813 --> 29:36.073
as a way to wirelessly
transmit electricity.

29:36.149 --> 29:40.319
But ancient astronaut theorists
suggest there is a far more

29:40.404 --> 29:44.824
advanced technology depicted on
the opposite wall of the chapel.

29:45.993 --> 29:49.203
HENRY:
On the opposite wall,
we see the same device,

29:49.329 --> 29:51.999
but now it’s attached to
what is called

29:52.082 --> 29:55.882
the Neshmet Barge of Osiris,
his resurrection barge.

29:56.003 --> 29:59.713
And what’s so amazing about
this barge is that its shape

29:59.840 --> 30:03.050
is virtually identical
to the way modern science

30:03.176 --> 30:07.886
portrays a wormhole or
an Einstein-Rosen bridge.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.855
McGOWAN:
The power of Abydos
is something

30:10.976 --> 30:14.186
that we’re still only
beginning to understand.

30:14.271 --> 30:17.651
It’s such a profoundly
mysterious place.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.364
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that

30:20.485 --> 30:24.235
by reconstructing
the temple at Abydos,

30:24.364 --> 30:26.744
Omm Sety was restoring
an ancient star gate?

30:26.867 --> 30:29.327
And if so,
was she being directed

30:29.411 --> 30:34.291
by otherworldly beings that
have the power to activate it?

30:36.168 --> 30:39.918
By the 1970s,
Omm Sety had become famous

30:40.047 --> 30:41.917
beyond the world of Egyptology.

30:42.049 --> 30:45.759
She was toasted by
luminaries like Carl Sagan

30:45.886 --> 30:48.716
and became the subject of
several books and documentaries.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.427
SETY:
Om Seti means

30:51.558 --> 30:54.888
"mother of Seti," because
I have a son named Seti,

30:54.978 --> 30:56.768
hoping he’d turn out
like the king.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.227
Of course, he didn’t.

30:59.566 --> 31:02.276
NARRATOR:
In a 1981 BBC documentary,

31:02.402 --> 31:07.242
76-year-old Omm Sety
visits the temple in Abydos

31:07.366 --> 31:10.156
with British Egyptologist
Dr. Rosalie David.

31:11.411 --> 31:14.251
Due to a hip injury,
she hasn’t been

31:14.331 --> 31:16.711
inside the temple
in almost a year.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.793
How do you feel,
now you’ve arrived back

31:19.920 --> 31:21.710
-after so many months?
-Oh, I feel marvelous!

31:21.797 --> 31:24.587
What are your feelings about it?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.798
Indescribable.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.775
NARRATOR:
The temple, which she was
integral in rebuilding,

31:32.891 --> 31:36.641
honors not just one
Egyptian god, but seven--

31:36.770 --> 31:40.980
and Omm Sety had
an incredible theory as to why

31:41.108 --> 31:44.818
it was considered the most
sacred site in ancient Egypt.

31:44.945 --> 31:47.165
People coming
from all over Egypt,

31:47.280 --> 31:50.780
you see, would find
their local important god

31:50.867 --> 31:52.037
-worshipped here.
-Yes.

31:52.119 --> 31:56.119
SETY: It may be
that the gods themselves

31:56.248 --> 31:58.748
were coming to Abydos
on pilgrimage to Osiris.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.424
I was beginning to think

32:00.502 --> 32:02.422
I’d never see it again
in this life.

32:02.504 --> 32:06.094
-Yes.
-I’ll see it in the next one.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.638
NARRATOR:
Could it be true that
this extraordinary woman

32:11.721 --> 32:14.971
was connected to
the gods of ancient Egypt?

32:15.100 --> 32:19.060
Gods that were perhaps
extraterrestrials?

32:20.230 --> 32:23.650
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

32:23.775 --> 32:26.355
the answer
is a resounding "yes,"

32:26.486 --> 32:29.816
and they suggest the proof
may soon be found

32:29.906 --> 32:31.696
by investigating

32:31.825 --> 32:34.955
a prophecy she made
about the tomb

32:35.036 --> 32:40.456
of King Tut.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.292
NARRATOR: Over the course
of her lifetime, Omm Sety

32:43.378 --> 32:46.628
made countless predictions
that were proven to be true.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.594
But perhaps her most significant

32:49.676 --> 32:52.346
was one that has yet
to be verified.

32:53.555 --> 32:57.685
In 1970, she claimed that
Pharaoh Seti had given her

32:57.809 --> 33:00.139
important information about
the location of

33:00.228 --> 33:03.228
the lost mummy of
an 18th Dynasty queen

33:03.356 --> 33:06.106
named Nefertiti.

33:06.193 --> 33:09.323
ROMANY: Nefertiti’s Tomb
has become the new obsession

33:09.404 --> 33:11.704
of the 21st century.

33:11.823 --> 33:14.283
Everyone wants to
find Nefertiti’s Tomb.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.617
Now here’s this truth:

33:16.703 --> 33:19.873
in Amarna, in the city of ruins,

33:19.956 --> 33:22.326
there is a tomb for
Nefertiti there.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.087
But her mummy
was never found there.

33:26.463 --> 33:29.803
NARRATOR:
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

33:29.883 --> 33:32.683
recovering this mummy
could be the most significant

33:32.761 --> 33:35.641
archaeological find
in human history--

33:35.722 --> 33:38.312
because they believe Nefertiti

33:38.391 --> 33:41.191
was very likely
not of this world.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.269
Nefertiti’s parents are unknown.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.148
On pictures,
she is shown with one of

33:48.235 --> 33:50.405
these elongated heads.

33:51.321 --> 33:53.991
Now we know
the old Egyptian gods,

33:54.074 --> 33:56.914
they had
longer heads than we have.

33:57.035 --> 34:00.495
And according to
the Pyramid Texts,

34:00.580 --> 34:03.290
sometimes they left the Earth.

34:03.416 --> 34:08.086
So Nefertiti’s parents
were maybe extraterrestrials.

34:09.548 --> 34:13.298
NARRATOR:
This sensational claim
applies not only to Nefertiti,

34:13.426 --> 34:17.346
but also to her husband,
the Pharaoh Akhenaten.

34:17.430 --> 34:20.520
During his rule,
Akhenaten introduced

34:20.600 --> 34:24.350
a new and controversial
monotheistic faith to Egypt,

34:24.437 --> 34:28.107
where the worship of multiple
gods was replaced with reverence

34:28.233 --> 34:33.243
to only one disk-shaped
sun god called Aten.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.951
TSOUKALOS:
Akhenaten is worshipping
this sun disk up in the sky,

34:38.034 --> 34:40.834
and he actually
communicates with it.

34:40.954 --> 34:45.214
He said he spoke with
a disk and it also had wings.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.422
So, the idea is that we have

34:48.503 --> 34:51.593
a misunderstood technology here.

34:52.549 --> 34:56.389
And Akhenaten, in the ancient
astronaut opinion, may have been

34:56.469 --> 34:57.719
an extraterrestrial.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.524
NARRATOR:
Some Egyptologists believe

35:00.640 --> 35:03.230
that a mummy found
in a vandalized tomb in

35:03.310 --> 35:07.060
the Valley of the Kings is
in fact Akhenaten,

35:07.147 --> 35:10.727
while others say the remains of
the controversial pharaoh

35:10.817 --> 35:12.277
are still missing.

35:12.360 --> 35:14.530
But locating Nefertiti’s mummy

35:14.654 --> 35:16.494
may be well within reach--

35:16.573 --> 35:19.493
thanks to Omm Sety.

35:19.576 --> 35:22.826
One amazing idea that Omm Sety
has left us,

35:22.954 --> 35:25.164
that is still yet to be
fulfilled,

35:25.290 --> 35:28.040
involves the tomb of
the Queen Nefertiti.

35:28.168 --> 35:31.958
During a conversation
with Pharaoh Seti,

35:32.047 --> 35:34.087
he told her that

35:34.174 --> 35:38.554
Nefertiti’s tomb is
nearby Tutankhamun’s tomb,

35:38.678 --> 35:40.928
in a place that no one
would think to look.

35:42.015 --> 35:45.645
NARRATOR: Tutankhamun,
better known as King Tut,

35:45.727 --> 35:48.187
was the son of Akhenaten
by another wife,

35:48.271 --> 35:50.941
making Nefertiti his stepmother.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.654
But when the tomb
of King Tut was discovered

35:53.735 --> 35:55.745
roughly a century ago,

35:55.862 --> 35:59.452
the entire area around
it was thoroughly excavated.

36:00.617 --> 36:04.367
So, how could Nefertiti’s
mummy be somewhere nearby?

36:05.330 --> 36:08.880
Over the past few years,
evidence has been found

36:08.958 --> 36:11.128
from ground penetration radar

36:11.211 --> 36:16.301
and other means of
the existence of a chamber

36:16.383 --> 36:21.473
next to that
of Tutankhamun himself.

36:21.554 --> 36:26.564
NARRATOR:
Incredibly, 35 years
after Omm Sety suggested

36:26.643 --> 36:30.813
that the mummy of Nefertiti
was hidden near King Tut’s tomb,

36:30.897 --> 36:33.897
evidence was
discovered that this tomb

36:33.983 --> 36:37.363
may contain a secret chamber.

36:38.738 --> 36:43.658
COLLINS:
In 2005, the British
Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves,

36:43.743 --> 36:45.543
he noticed that there were

36:45.620 --> 36:48.000
some cracks in the walls.

36:48.081 --> 36:51.171
And on further examination,

36:51.251 --> 36:53.501
he came to the conclusion
that these could possibly

36:53.586 --> 36:55.836
be that of a doorway

36:55.922 --> 36:58.052
into a separate chamber.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.762
And since that time,
there has been radar

37:02.887 --> 37:04.807
done inside the tomb
which definitely seems

37:04.931 --> 37:08.391
to confirm that there
is some kind of chamber.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.096
And is it possible, therefore,

37:11.229 --> 37:14.149
that this could be
the tomb of Nefertiti?

37:14.274 --> 37:19.614
NARRATOR:
Archeologists are still debating
how to enter the hidden chamber

37:19.696 --> 37:23.116
without causing severe
damage to King Tut’s tomb.

37:23.199 --> 37:26.119
Once they do, will they discover

37:26.244 --> 37:28.624
that Omm Sety was correct?

37:28.747 --> 37:31.367
And that her amazing life
didn’t just

37:31.458 --> 37:33.208
connect us to ancient Egypt,

37:33.293 --> 37:36.173
but to our ancestors
in the stars?

37:36.296 --> 37:39.876
NEWMAN: Nefertiti’s tomb
is potentially very special,

37:39.966 --> 37:41.466
because Nefertiti may have had

37:41.551 --> 37:45.051
the secrets of the whole
Akhenaten lineage.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.215
Did she have
an elongated skull herself?

37:48.308 --> 37:50.308
I think finding her tomb

37:50.393 --> 37:54.233
could answer a lot of unanswered
questions in ancient Egypt.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.068
NARRATOR: Throughout her life,

37:57.150 --> 37:59.110
Omm Sety made
numerous predictions

37:59.194 --> 38:01.744
that years later
were proven to be true.

38:01.821 --> 38:05.701
And according to
ancient astronaut theorists,

38:05.825 --> 38:09.905
she may well have been
facilitating an alien agenda--

38:09.996 --> 38:14.496
one whose purpose
is soon to be revealed.

38:19.506 --> 38:22.836
NARRATOR: On April 21, 1981,

38:22.967 --> 38:25.087
Dorothy Eady,

38:25.178 --> 38:27.468
now famously known as Omm Sety,

38:27.555 --> 38:31.475
dies in Abydos at the age of 77.

38:32.393 --> 38:35.863
Of her many
contributions to Egyptology,

38:35.980 --> 38:38.900
the reconstruction
of the Temple of Seti I

38:39.025 --> 38:41.395
stands as her
greatest accomplishment,

38:41.528 --> 38:45.238
attracting millions
of tourists every year.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.872
NEWMAN:
Because of Omm Sety,
Abydos is one of the most

38:49.994 --> 38:52.874
important places
in ancient Egypt.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.747
The Seti temple is an
absolutely fascinating temple.

38:56.876 --> 39:02.256
It’s got beautiful carvings and
pillars and wall inscriptions.

39:02.382 --> 39:06.222
It has the famous
kings list on it,

39:06.302 --> 39:08.932
which is really interesting,

39:09.055 --> 39:10.505
because this really describes

39:10.598 --> 39:13.308
kings going back
thousands of years.

39:17.564 --> 39:21.284
NARRATOR: While many consider
the Temple of Seti in Abydos

39:21.401 --> 39:23.441
to be the most
sacred site in Egypt,

39:23.570 --> 39:25.360
for ancient astronaut theorists,

39:25.446 --> 39:29.196
it may represent
something even more profound.

39:29.284 --> 39:31.624
Could this
ancient structure have

39:31.744 --> 39:34.044
once been capable of
opening a portal

39:34.122 --> 39:35.792
to other parts of the universe,

39:35.915 --> 39:38.245
as Omm Sety claimed?

39:39.002 --> 39:41.752
And was her work
in Egypt the fulfillment

39:41.838 --> 39:44.418
of an otherworldly agenda?

39:44.507 --> 39:46.627
HENRY:
Omm Sety’s story has meaning

39:46.759 --> 39:49.759
on many levels:
as a spiritual story,

39:49.846 --> 39:52.766
as a reincarnation story,

39:52.891 --> 39:54.851
as an archeological story.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.404
But most importantly to me,
it says

39:57.478 --> 39:59.648
that we can open portals

39:59.772 --> 40:01.772
between our
earthly material world

40:01.900 --> 40:04.490
and the immaterial realm
of the gods.

40:04.611 --> 40:06.781
That’s the realm of
the extraterrestrials.

40:07.947 --> 40:10.567
McGOWAN: There’s something so
special about Omm Sety because

40:10.658 --> 40:15.698
she makes all of these ideas--
interdimensional realities,

40:15.788 --> 40:20.168
time travel, connections
with otherworldly beings--

40:20.293 --> 40:23.003
she makes all of these
things real.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.842
Her predictions came true.

40:26.966 --> 40:30.216
And Omm Sety really
influenced and inspired

40:30.303 --> 40:32.353
generations of people

40:32.472 --> 40:34.722
who wanted to get deeper into

40:34.807 --> 40:37.307
an understanding of Egyptology.

40:38.728 --> 40:43.608
DEES:
When it came to being a woman of

40:43.691 --> 40:44.981
service to Egyptology,

40:45.109 --> 40:48.699
she was all
seriousness and science.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.412
But the esoteric part,

40:52.492 --> 40:55.702
the parallel consciousness,
that was there, too.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.208
And I have no way of proving

40:58.331 --> 41:00.041
that she didn’t experience this

41:00.166 --> 41:03.286
and there are so many
reasons to think she did.

41:03.378 --> 41:06.378
TSOUKALOS:
Omm Sety is one of the most

41:06.506 --> 41:09.216
enduring mysterious stories

41:09.342 --> 41:12.762
in the history of humankind.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.965
Because even the Egyptologists

41:15.056 --> 41:20.016
say that she had something
that nobody else had.

41:20.103 --> 41:25.113
So is it possible that
maybe she tuned into

41:25.191 --> 41:29.031
a direct channel
of ancient Egypt?

41:30.530 --> 41:33.410
I think the answer
to that is "yes."

41:34.450 --> 41:36.910
NARRATOR: Some believe
that Omm Sety’s story

41:37.036 --> 41:38.576
is not yet complete.

41:38.705 --> 41:42.715
Is it possible that
her life’s work was to help

41:42.834 --> 41:46.094
prepare for the return
of Egypt’s ancient gods?

41:48.089 --> 41:52.549
Perhaps, like Dorothy Eady,
humankind is about to awaken

41:52.635 --> 41:54.425
to an entirely new reality,

41:54.554 --> 41:56.764
and find that the key to

41:56.889 --> 41:59.559
unlocking our future
in the stars

41:59.684 --> 42:04.944
can be found deep in our own
extraterrestrial past.
