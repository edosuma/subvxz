35:51.160 --> 35:52.050
Say again?

35:52.250 --> 35:54.130
Teeth along the spine.

35:54.330 --> 35:56.900
From what I could make out,
the lacerations to Berwick's...

35:58.280 --> 36:00.450
This one's male.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.060
How is that useful?

36:04.260 --> 36:05.980
It narrows it down.

36:06.180 --> 36:08.450
To half the fucking city!

36:09.540 --> 36:11.480
Who are you
really helping here, huh?

36:11.680 --> 36:14.900
Us?
Or do you just feel like shit

36:15.100 --> 36:17.400
for wanting to crawl off
back to Tirnanoc

36:17.600 --> 36:19.370
with your little
Critch friends

36:19.560 --> 36:23.040
and now Berwick is off
to a cold slab?

36:23.230 --> 36:26.000
I thought you should know.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.310
Now you know.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.550
Yeah, all right!

36:33.750 --> 36:36.380
So it's a male!

36:36.580 --> 36:39.110
Have you got anything else?

36:40.110 --> 36:41.510
[whistle blows]

36:41.710 --> 36:43.660
[Cuppins] Sergeant! Over here!

36:50.910 --> 36:52.440
[Dombey] Bloody hell.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.650
They're Burguish Marines.

36:54.850 --> 36:57.170
The tide's bringing more in.
There's dozens.

36:59.050 --> 37:02.030
They were on the ships.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.990
Balefire was sending troops.

37:05.190 --> 37:08.000
What for? The fae were
happy to be leaving.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.140
They wouldn't make trouble.

37:12.390 --> 37:14.300
They weren't there for the fae.

37:14.490 --> 37:17.270
They're gonna retake Tirnanoc.

37:37.710 --> 37:39.320
<i>[Polsted] Get back in there.</i>

37:39.520 --> 37:41.240
Back inside. Keep moving!

37:41.440 --> 37:43.620
Tourmaline? Tourmaline?

37:43.820 --> 37:46.700
- Tourmaline!
- [Polsted] Get inside.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.540
Keep moving!

37:48.740 --> 37:50.160
Thank the Martyr.

37:50.360 --> 37:51.670
[panting] Are you all right?

37:51.870 --> 37:52.710
I saw it.

37:52.910 --> 37:55.210
I saw what's coming for me.

37:55.410 --> 37:57.590
Well, if it does,

37:57.790 --> 38:00.510
it'll have to get through me.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.990
[gasps]

38:07.450 --> 38:09.020
Is it true?

38:09.220 --> 38:11.060
Your Raven turned on us?

38:11.260 --> 38:13.270
Well, is it?!

38:13.470 --> 38:14.940
Vignette?

38:15.140 --> 38:17.000
Vignette!

38:23.710 --> 38:25.780
Vignette?

38:25.980 --> 38:27.700
What are you doing?

38:27.900 --> 38:29.290
Telling the Raven
I want to meet.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.000
Will you look after her?

38:31.200 --> 38:32.410
I'm not letting her out
of my sight.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.290
The Black Raven have gone feral.

38:34.490 --> 38:36.340
You need to stay away from them.

38:36.530 --> 38:37.800
Those ships were
everyone's way out.

38:37.990 --> 38:39.130
They were our way out!

38:39.330 --> 38:40.840
Not mine.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.260
It was nice to pretend,
but the Sight is never wrong.

38:43.460 --> 38:44.640
Don't say that.

38:44.830 --> 38:46.240
I'm gonna get you out.

38:49.030 --> 38:50.350
She's gonna get you out?

38:50.550 --> 38:52.480
By going after the Raven?

38:52.680 --> 38:54.400
All by yourself.

38:54.590 --> 38:56.750
They'll be laying low.
If anyone can find them...

38:58.420 --> 38:59.900
And if you do?

39:00.100 --> 39:02.290
I'll find a way to stop them.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.090
[Kaine grunts]

39:25.290 --> 39:27.220
Vignette, wait! I can explain!

39:27.420 --> 39:29.390
[grunts]

39:29.590 --> 39:32.100
- Would you stop?! [grunts]
- Oh, you bastard!

39:32.300 --> 39:33.560
We had one chance to go home.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.060
One bit of hope,
and you took it away from us.

39:35.260 --> 39:37.060
Just listen to me!

39:37.260 --> 39:38.860
[grunting]

39:39.060 --> 39:40.150
Stop!

39:40.350 --> 39:41.610
Get fucked, Kaine.

39:41.810 --> 39:44.090
- No!
- [grunts]

39:46.800 --> 39:48.800
[chain rattling]

39:52.550 --> 39:54.710
[muttering]

39:54.900 --> 39:57.290
Get the fuck off me! Get fu...

39:57.490 --> 39:59.430
[panting, muttering]

40:06.110 --> 40:08.180
[shouts]

40:08.380 --> 40:10.800
Fucking traitors,
the lot of you!

40:11.000 --> 40:12.560
[spits]

40:12.760 --> 40:15.480
[Boz] All right, all right,
calm down, missy.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.940
Look, let me take her
off your hands.

40:18.140 --> 40:20.360
There's still
a fat bounty on her head.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.190
I'll tell you what...

40:22.390 --> 40:23.860
I'll knock it off the rent.

40:24.060 --> 40:26.280
You'd sell your own mother
for a wink and ten stivers,

40:26.480 --> 40:28.570
but the rest of you?

40:28.770 --> 40:30.410
Oona would be ashamed of you!

40:30.610 --> 40:32.530
She wanted freedom for all
of us, and you took that away!

40:32.730 --> 40:33.830
[panting]

40:34.030 --> 40:35.410
[Kaine] You're wrong, Vini.

40:35.610 --> 40:37.870
You weren't sailing
those people to freedom.

40:38.070 --> 40:40.730
Just another cage.

40:43.150 --> 40:45.440
What the hell are you
talking about? [pants]

40:49.780 --> 40:51.780
[bells clanging in distance]

41:03.750 --> 41:05.650
Did you know?

41:05.850 --> 41:07.320
Did I know about what?

41:07.520 --> 41:09.570
The troops.

41:09.770 --> 41:11.780
On our ships.

41:11.980 --> 41:14.950
Philo, how do you imagine
I got those ships so fast?

41:15.150 --> 41:17.540
I convinced the military

41:17.740 --> 41:19.410
to take the faefolk aboard.

41:19.610 --> 41:21.880
They were going there anyway.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.090
To retake Tirnanoc?

41:24.290 --> 41:26.260
Yes. The Pact had retreated,

41:26.450 --> 41:28.260
the old colonies were abandoned,

41:28.460 --> 41:31.530
and the Parliament
wanted them back.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.450
Stealing the Pix homeland.

41:39.530 --> 41:41.770
How's that helping the fae?

41:41.970 --> 41:44.440
Martyr's sake, Philo.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.790
I found a way to help them
escape from the Row.

41:49.630 --> 41:52.320
You've no idea
the sordid deals I had to make

41:52.520 --> 41:55.280
with those disgusting
little men, with their fantasies

41:55.480 --> 41:59.000
of supremacy
and world domination.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.500
So the moment
when it came to act,

42:02.700 --> 42:05.170
I seized the only opportunity
to help the fae.

42:05.370 --> 42:08.550
I manipulated
those cowardly bigots

42:08.750 --> 42:11.220
to use the fae as cover

42:11.420 --> 42:13.360
for their military schemes.

42:14.650 --> 42:17.530
I delayed the ships
from sailing to make it happen.

42:22.830 --> 42:25.250
And now look at all this.

42:26.830 --> 42:29.250
All these dead.

42:31.340 --> 42:34.070
For which I am,

42:34.270 --> 42:36.970
in part, to blame.

42:46.310 --> 42:48.770
The Raven found out.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.990
That's why they attacked.

42:55.990 --> 42:58.510
Those ships were sending
the first troops.

42:58.710 --> 43:01.430
We had to sink them
before they left the harbor.

43:01.630 --> 43:04.580
And before any fae got on board.

43:06.160 --> 43:08.710
But feck you for thinking
we'd want to hurt our own kind.

43:11.250 --> 43:14.110
They were betraying you, Vini.

43:14.310 --> 43:16.260
They were betraying us all.

43:17.550 --> 43:19.450
<i>[Millworthy] Why would</i>
<i>they join with the Sparas?</i>

43:19.650 --> 43:21.370
Didn't you say

43:21.570 --> 43:24.580
it killed two Black Raven?

43:24.780 --> 43:27.600
It's killing humans and fae.

43:28.770 --> 43:31.210
Pitting us against each other.

43:31.410 --> 43:33.970
A decent copper--

43:34.170 --> 43:36.890
best I knew--

43:37.090 --> 43:39.810
figured that out.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.390
Question is, why?

43:42.590 --> 43:45.950
Philo... what do you
know about the New Dawn?

43:46.950 --> 43:49.410
The Burgue never wanted
Tirnanoc to be free.

43:50.750 --> 43:53.070
I've been such a fool.

43:53.270 --> 43:55.200
You tried to tell me.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.550
I just didn't want to listen.

43:59.090 --> 44:01.330
We're not
a lost cause anymore, Vini.

44:01.530 --> 44:03.160
We got new friends.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.680
We're not fighting this alone.

44:07.680 --> 44:10.210
What friends?

44:10.410 --> 44:11.960
Their emissaries arrived
yesterday

44:12.160 --> 44:14.130
to broker a new peace deal.

44:14.330 --> 44:15.670
Convenient timing.

44:15.870 --> 44:17.340
And our spies tell us
that the Pact is

44:17.540 --> 44:19.180
on the point of surrendering.

44:19.380 --> 44:22.570
The New Dawn have just defeated
the Burgue's greatest enemy.

44:25.910 --> 44:28.440
If this is the New Dawn...

44:28.640 --> 44:30.830
it's not peace they're after.

44:32.710 --> 44:35.170
They're bringing a revolution.

44:38.170 --> 44:40.840
The Black Raven respect you,
Comrade.

44:44.430 --> 44:46.430
Are you ready to lead them?
