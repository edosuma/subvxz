WELL, MY DAD SAID
I COULD GO

19:54.934 --> 19:56.600
TO DENTAL SCHOOL
IN ZURICH.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.867
THAT'S GREAT.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.967
NO, IT MEANS I'LL BE
AWAY FROM YOU.

19:59.967 --> 20:02.000
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHY HE SAID IT.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.934
HE'D RATHER HAVE ME
SCRAPING TEETH

20:03.934 --> 20:05.500
THAN BE WITH A TIPTON.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.400
OH...I SEE.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.000
SO, I TURNED HIM DOWN.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.233
YOU DID?

20:11.233 --> 20:13.000
BUT IT'S YOUR DREAM.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.500
WHAT ABOUT
ALL THOSE POOR PEOPLE

20:14.500 --> 20:17.200
WITH PTEREODACTYLITIS?

20:17.200 --> 20:19.700
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU.

20:19.700 --> 20:20.867
OH, TODD!

20:20.867 --> 20:23.400
OH, THAT'S THE MOST
WONDERFUL THING

20:23.400 --> 20:25.500
ANYONE'S EVER DONE
FOR ME.

20:25.500 --> 20:28.700
AND I WON'T
LET YOU DO IT.

20:28.700 --> 20:30.967
WHAT ABOUT US?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.867
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE...

20:37.867 --> 20:41.667
YOU HAVE TO THINK OF THEM
BEFORE YOURSELF.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.133
[SIGHS]

20:43.133 --> 20:46.500
IT'LL ONLY TAKE ME
8 YEARS TO BECOME
A DENTIST.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.734
THEN I CAN SEE YOU?

20:47.734 --> 20:51.033
CAN WE MAKE IT
A MORNING APPOINTMENT?

20:51.700 --> 20:54.100
ABSOLUTELY.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.600
THAT WAS REALLY
WONDERFUL, LONDON.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.567
MADDIE...

21:04.567 --> 21:08.467
THAT ROMEO AND JULIET BOOK
HAS A HAPPY ENDING, RIGHT?

21:09.400 --> 21:10.767
YEAH.

21:19.100 --> 21:21.600
CODY, DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY
TO YOU BROTHER?

21:21.600 --> 21:25.600
I'M SORRY I FLICKED FLOUR
IN YOUR FACE.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.100
ZACK?

21:27.100 --> 21:29.300
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

21:29.300 --> 21:31.000
ZACK!

21:31.000 --> 21:33.967
I'M SORRY
I WORKED YOU
LIKE A PACK MULE.

21:33.967 --> 21:36.467
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF THE MONEY.

21:36.467 --> 21:38.500
LOTS AND LOTS
OF MONEY.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.100
BAGLOADS OF MONEY!

21:40.100 --> 21:40.934
ZACK!

21:40.934 --> 21:42.200
SORRY.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.734
IT'S OK THAT YOU WANTED
TO MAKE MONEY

21:43.734 --> 21:45.233
OFF MY COOKIES,

21:45.233 --> 21:48.133
BUT I JUST NEED TIME
TO MAKE THEM JUST RIGHT.

21:48.133 --> 21:50.000
AND 75% OF THE PROFITS.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.133
40.
50!

21:51.133 --> 21:52.834
DONE.
[BOTH SPIT]

21:52.834 --> 21:55.133
OK, BUT I GET 10%
OF BOTH YOUR CUTS.

21:55.133 --> 21:56.834
DONE.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.934
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
