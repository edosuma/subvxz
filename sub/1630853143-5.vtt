00:19.978 --> 00:22.022
[nervous panting]

00:25.233 --> 00:26.901
[panicked grunting]

00:27.902 --> 00:30.030
[tense music plays]

00:49.215 --> 00:51.009
-[knocking at door]
-[gasps]

00:53.636 --> 00:54.763
Good morning, miss.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.848
[yawns]

00:58.308 --> 00:59.267
Rose.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.855
Has my mother yet awakened?

01:06.399 --> 01:08.443
I did not overindulge.

01:08.526 --> 01:11.654
Truly, it was just a poor night of sleep.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.240
I shall fetch a glass
of raw eggs and garlic, ma'am.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.867
Should be just the thing.

01:15.950 --> 01:19.037
[Violet sighs]
Are you feeling better, dearest?

01:20.205 --> 01:23.500
Perhaps I, too, caught whatever it was
that sent you home early from the party.

01:23.583 --> 01:26.503
I have a terrible headache, indeed.

01:30.131 --> 01:31.257
What is it?

01:31.341 --> 01:32.425
[exhales sharply]

01:33.176 --> 01:34.010
I am engaged.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.638
Oh! [chuckles]

01:37.889 --> 01:41.518
Well, that is wonderful news.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.771
So, you will be a princess.

01:45.855 --> 01:46.815
-No.
-No?

01:46.898 --> 01:47.732
No, I will not.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.818
Mama, I am engaged to the duke.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.904
The duke asked for my hand,
and I accepted.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.155
[gasps]

01:56.366 --> 01:58.576
You do not seem pleased.
Whatever is wrong?

01:58.660 --> 02:00.745
Oh no. No-- Nothing is wrong.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.582
It simply happened so quickly.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.627
I've not had a moment to take it in.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.089
But I am overjoyed, Mama, truly.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.841
Of course you are.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.551
You are to be a duchess!

02:14.634 --> 02:17.387
Oh, darling! [laughs]

02:17.470 --> 02:19.806
I knew there was something between you…

02:20.306 --> 02:21.683
ruse or not!

02:21.766 --> 02:23.601
Well, tell me. Tell me everything!

02:23.685 --> 02:25.186
How do you feel?

02:27.021 --> 02:28.481
-So in love.
-[Violet laughs]

02:28.565 --> 02:32.402
I'm unsure how I can be expected
to wait an entire month to marry.

02:34.487 --> 02:37.782
Could we not obtain a special license
to marry this week?

02:42.579 --> 02:44.414
I do not wish to lie to you…

02:45.707 --> 02:48.835
-But the duke and I--
-You do not need to tell me anything.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.549
Whatever happened
between the two of you,

02:54.632 --> 02:56.301
it is all right. [chuckles]

02:57.343 --> 03:00.638
I know good society
makes quite a fuss about such things…

03:01.639 --> 03:02.640
but when it comes to love,

03:02.724 --> 03:04.976
such things happen
more frequently than one might expect.

03:05.643 --> 03:09.731
Even your father and I, we had trouble
controlling our passions as well.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.441
[Wilson] Your drink, ma'am.

03:11.524 --> 03:14.986
Will not be necessary, Wilson.
I am feeling much improved.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.864
We have a wedding to plan in three days.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.158
My darling girl,

03:20.241 --> 03:22.493
you are getting what you always wanted.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.537
You are marrying for love.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.498
[theme music plays]

03:27.582 --> 03:29.125
[Violet chuckles lightly]

03:35.715 --> 03:38.718
[Lady Whistledown]
One may say modesty is a virtue,

03:38.801 --> 03:42.055
yet this author
is hardly a virtuous woman.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.432
It is therefore my great pleasure

03:44.515 --> 03:48.561
to announce the news others questioned,
but I never doubted.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.480
It will be
the grandest wedding of the year.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.149
Tulips enough to fill the great room
and the finest silks.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.194
Only the best
for Miss Bridgerton and my nephew.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.989
The latest Whistledown?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.824
How does she report my triumph?

04:01.908 --> 04:02.825
[moans nervously]

04:02.909 --> 04:05.870
[Lady Whistledown] The diamond
of the season has made her match,

04:05.954 --> 04:09.916
officially betrothed
to the Duke of Hastings.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.673
Has something happened?

04:16.756 --> 04:18.299
The bride, undoubtedly,

04:18.383 --> 04:21.928
is giddy with anticipation
over the impending nuptials…

04:22.011 --> 04:24.514
I shall need fittings for the dress
and my trousseau.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.765
-[Rose grunts]
-And, oh…

04:25.848 --> 04:29.519
-I am forgetting something, surely.
-I shall take care of everything.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.563
Just think, you shall be the duchess 
by Saturday. [chuckles]

04:32.647 --> 04:36.359
…an event that will apparently take place
sooner rather than later.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.069
[horses neighing]

04:39.529 --> 04:42.031
Of course, there are only two reasons

04:42.115 --> 04:45.827
to procure a special license
and race to the altar:

04:45.910 --> 04:46.911
true love,

04:47.537 --> 04:49.372
or concealing a scandal.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.292
How does it feel, sister, to be in love?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.585
Imagine leaping off a cliff
and shattering on the ground.

04:54.669 --> 04:55.962
A fair analogy?

04:56.045 --> 04:58.548
I am afraid I cannot find
the words, dear Hyacinth.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.925
Though, Eloise, I believe
you will know what love feels like

05:01.009 --> 05:02.093
soon enough next season.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.262
You think I am
to follow in your footsteps?

05:04.345 --> 05:06.139
Can there be a more dreadful fate?

05:06.222 --> 05:10.143
You do know that I am setting
the standard for your future matches, yes?

05:10.226 --> 05:11.519
You should be grateful.

05:11.602 --> 05:15.398
The only thing I am grateful for
is that I am not you, nor will I ever be.

05:15.481 --> 05:20.111
Miss Daphne, His Royal Highness
Prince Friedrich is here for you.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.407
-I am sorry.
-You have nothing to be sorry for.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.908
No… No promises were made.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.037
Although,
I thought we shared an understanding

05:29.120 --> 05:31.205
with our discussions of the future.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.333
But, uh…

05:33.833 --> 05:37.503
the fault is mine for misreading
your polite attentions as something more.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.714
No. You did not misread me.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.716
Then why…

05:43.301 --> 05:45.595
This engagement is
of your own free will, is it not?

05:45.678 --> 05:47.764
-[Daphne chuckles]
-If the duke is forcing your hand--

05:47.847 --> 05:48.806
Forcing me?

05:49.307 --> 05:51.976
My goodness!
If anything, I am the one forcing him.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.564
What I mean to say

05:56.647 --> 06:00.193
is that love is surely
the greatest force of all.

06:01.277 --> 06:02.695
Once the duke and I realized

06:02.779 --> 06:05.615
we were completely enamored
with each other,

06:05.698 --> 06:07.575
nothing could stand between us.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.703
Not even, I'm sorry to say,

06:11.245 --> 06:14.749
the attentions of a good
and kind man such as yourself.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.004
Then I can only wish you a lifetime
of contentment with your new husband.

06:20.963 --> 06:23.174
It was a pleasure to know you,
Miss Bridgerton.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.059
[door creaking]

06:36.312 --> 06:37.647
Hyacinth!

06:37.730 --> 06:39.315
I could not help it, sister.

06:39.816 --> 06:40.983
Though, I must say,

06:41.067 --> 06:45.655
I certainly hope the duke's proposal
was at least half as romantic as that.

07:00.461 --> 07:03.089
-Did we not say ten o'clock?
-[Daphne grunts lightly]

07:04.340 --> 07:05.216
We did.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.052
There he is.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.267
Well, do not make haste on our account.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.648
A most heartfelt congratulations,
Your Grace.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.984
I look forward
to counting you as part of our family.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.485
-As do I.
-[Violet chuckles]

07:25.361 --> 07:27.488
Did you bring the bar with you, boy?

07:29.615 --> 07:32.493
Perhaps we should promenade?

07:35.663 --> 07:36.914
[Simon clears throat]

07:39.208 --> 07:40.334
[sniffs]

07:46.466 --> 07:48.050
-[Daphne] Have you--
-[Simon] I should--

07:48.176 --> 07:49.218
[Simon grunts]

07:49.719 --> 07:50.887
[chuckles] I was…

07:50.970 --> 07:54.515
I was going to ask if you had tried
drinking raw eggs and garlic.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.561
I hear it works wonders to rid yourself

07:58.644 --> 08:00.146
of the lingering effects of…

08:03.399 --> 08:05.026
-What were you going to say?
-What?

08:05.109 --> 08:07.570
Before, you started to say something.

08:07.653 --> 08:09.447
Oh, I-- I do not recall.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.449
Simon, look at me.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.793
Well, if it isn't the most 
talked-about couple in the ton.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.587
Such a perfect-looking pair.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.798
Indeed. The two of you
will make a fine family, I am sure of it.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.011
Thank you.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.805
-We are so happy.
-Very much so.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.062
[Lord Wetherby] Hmm.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.822
I remember that feeling,

08:51.906 --> 08:54.033
the nerves of new love.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.827
-Or something like it.
-[Violet chuckles]

09:05.753 --> 09:07.922
-Madame Delacroix, good day. May I--
-She is not here.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.799
I only beg a moment of her time.

09:09.882 --> 09:13.177
She does not owe me her time, I know that.
She does not owe me anything.

09:13.261 --> 09:16.055
But I wish to provide for her regardless,
as I promised.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.724
She will be taken care of.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.895
-Will you tell her?
-You are too late. Siena's gone.

09:22.979 --> 09:23.854
Gone?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.107
You mean, she's left town?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.441
Indeed.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.987
As it transpires, my lord,
she does not need your money,

09:31.070 --> 09:33.447
nor anything else from you,
for that matter.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.660
-Tell me where she is?
-Leave the young lady alone.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.912
Have you not done enough?

09:56.095 --> 09:57.263
[clears throat]

09:58.014 --> 10:01.100
It seems Mrs. Varley had some trouble
at the modiste this morning.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.270
Madame Delacroix is refusing
to give her any of the dresses

10:04.353 --> 10:06.063
until the last few months' bills are paid.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.692
The young ladies have plenty of dresses.

10:10.192 --> 10:12.445
Perhaps it is possible
for them to wear them all again.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.909
And perhaps it is possible for you
to do without your tobacco as well!

10:20.411 --> 10:22.455
Mr. Colin Bridgerton for Miss Thompson.

10:25.082 --> 10:28.377
Oh, Mr. Bridgerton, these are beautiful.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.839
I applaud you, Miss Thompson.
I bring you flowers on each of my visits,

10:31.922 --> 10:34.800
and yet you react
with admirable surprise every time.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.595
I shall need
to bring you something unexpected.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.598
-A bushel of tomatoes, perhaps.
-Oh! [laughs]

10:40.681 --> 10:41.724
Marina hates tomatoes.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.851
That is untrue.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.394
I love tomatoes.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.731
Colin, you know where I have heard
you can get excellent tomatoes?

10:49.231 --> 10:50.066
Greece.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.526
Perhaps you could
bring back a tomato plant

10:52.610 --> 10:54.403
for Miss Thompson as a souvenir

10:54.487 --> 10:56.155
when you return
from your travels this year.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.783
I am uncertain of my travels
at the moment, Pen.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.452
-But you were so keen to travel.
-It is true.

11:01.535 --> 11:04.121
But, were I to go,
there may be things in London

11:04.205 --> 11:06.248
I should miss even more
than seeing the world.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.126
-Some tea, Mr. Bridgerton?
-That would be lovely.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.254
Mama?

11:13.881 --> 11:16.967
-Do you think this is wise?
-Whatever do you mean?

11:17.051 --> 11:18.260
Colin is young,

11:18.344 --> 11:20.054
years from seriously thinking
about marriage.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.515
I would hate to think
Marina is simply wasting her time,

11:22.598 --> 11:24.475
time she simply does not have, of course.

11:24.558 --> 11:25.601
That is all.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.488
[kitchen staff clamoring]

11:40.074 --> 11:41.992
Your mistress will not know
the household staff

11:42.076 --> 11:43.202
at the duke's country home,

11:43.285 --> 11:44.704
so it will be your business

11:44.787 --> 11:47.164
to attend to her needs
and ease her arrival.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.583
Her happiness is your greatest concern.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.127
Oh no!

11:51.210 --> 11:52.545
No, no, no!

11:52.628 --> 11:55.214
The icing must be as white as lilies.

11:55.297 --> 11:57.049
This is a proper family.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.843
A shipment of fine sugar went down at sea.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.970
There is no more in London,
for love nor money.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.347
Does Miss Daphne wish
for roses or lilacs for the ceremony?

12:03.431 --> 12:04.432
Uh…

12:04.515 --> 12:07.143
Does your mistress wish the cake
to be soaked in rum or brandy?

12:07.226 --> 12:09.145
Will it be tongue
or ham with eggs for the reception?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.896
I am not sure. I shall ask.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.899
Rose, you are
the future duchess's lady's maid.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.609
You must know these things.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.450
[Genevieve] Your wedding gown
is a long way from being finished,

12:22.533 --> 12:23.367
Miss Bridgerton.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.870
I promise you will not be disappointed.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.622
She will need a new pelisse too,

12:28.706 --> 12:30.833
and then the more intimate items.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.753
Four nightdresses, perhaps? Or five?

12:33.836 --> 12:37.047
What could I possibly need
with five new nightdresses?

12:37.131 --> 12:40.384
They are not for you, ma chère,
but for your amoureux.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.428
What else do you think a honeymoon is for?

12:43.637 --> 12:45.431
It will be a most special time, dear.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.432
[shop door closes]

12:46.515 --> 12:49.560
Yes, five. Five nightdresses
will do nicely. [chuckles]

12:55.441 --> 12:56.275
Daphne!

12:56.358 --> 12:58.027
How lovely to see you.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.530
Oh, I do hope
your wedding dress will be ready in time.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.366
Madam Delacroix must be working so fast.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.662
Mama, might you spare me a moment?

13:08.746 --> 13:11.457
I must have Cressida's opinion
on some fabric.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.083
Her taste is impeccable.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.710
Of course, dear.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.922
I am to have a new pelisse
for my honeymoon.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.634
What about this color?
Trimmed with fur, perhaps.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.260
Fur, at this time of year?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.138
Well, I suppose it depends 
on how much time

13:26.222 --> 13:28.098
you and the duke spend outdoors.

13:28.182 --> 13:31.685
But you are fond
of a midnight garden stroll, I believe.

13:32.686 --> 13:34.188
I do not know what you mean.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.942
I am almost certain I saw the two of you
in the gardens at the Trowbridge ball.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.860
No chaperone in sight.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.153
How strange.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.782
I do not recall leaving the ballroom.

13:44.907 --> 13:45.991
[Cressida] Hmm.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.369
Though I dare say
it would have been difficult

13:48.452 --> 13:51.247
to see the gardens
with any real clarity at night,

13:51.956 --> 13:54.375
unless you were actually
out in them yourself.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.796
My view of the garden was perfectly clear
from the safety of the terrace, Daphne.

14:00.172 --> 14:03.342
You dallied with the prince
purely to rouse the duke's jealousy,

14:03.425 --> 14:07.054
and then you lured him into those gardens
to trap him into marriage.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.598
I never would have imagined

14:09.682 --> 14:13.185
that a Bridgerton
would ever come to know such shame.

14:14.186 --> 14:17.481
You should consider
your words more carefully, Cressida.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.776
In a matter of days, I am to be a duchess,

14:20.860 --> 14:24.113
and you shall be just as you are now,

14:24.196 --> 14:26.073
unmarried and untitled.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.451
So you can either be
a duchess's friend or her enemy.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.328
It is entirely up to you.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.289
[scoffs]

14:33.789 --> 14:37.793
First, let us see if you actually manage
to drag him down that aisle at all.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.629
I would imagine
a man like the duke does not take kindly

14:40.713 --> 14:42.506
to being forced into anything.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.801
[tense music plays]

14:46.427 --> 14:48.679
[nervous breathing]

14:50.097 --> 14:52.516
["Beethoven's 5th Symphony" plays]

15:02.818 --> 15:04.695
[Prince Friedrich]
I bid you farewell, Tante.

15:04.778 --> 15:07.406
I shall be returning
to Prussia this afternoon.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.703
Am I to believe you truly long
for sweet pickles and sauerkraut?

15:12.786 --> 15:14.121
Fight for the girl!

15:14.997 --> 15:16.373
Hastings is merely a duke.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.083
You are a prince.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.795
I have no interest in brandishing my title
before the young lady, nor do I need to.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.674
I am happy for them.
Everyone is happy for them.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.135
You have read
of what your dear Whistledown writes.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.512
What do you want?

15:31.388 --> 15:33.641
-It is the king, Your Majesty.
-Dead?

15:34.433 --> 15:35.267
Lucid.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.144
[exasperated sigh]

15:38.228 --> 15:40.856
Auf Wiedersehen, if you must go.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.525
While you may be content to accept defeat…

15:44.485 --> 15:47.071
it is certainly not how I approach things.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.371
[church bells ringing]

15:58.916 --> 16:00.292
[Simon] Apologies for my tardiness.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.335
Not at all.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.629
The archbishop is yet to arrive.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.844
[church bells continue]

16:12.513 --> 16:15.391
-We should discuss Daphne's dowry.
-There is nothing to discuss.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.768
-I will not accept one.
-I beg your pardon?

16:17.851 --> 16:21.605
I need not be paid to marry Daphne.
It is an insulting custom in my judgment.

16:21.689 --> 16:23.315
You may place the money in trust for her,

16:24.149 --> 16:27.111
but you need not harbor any doubts
of my intention to support your sister.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.488
Her well-being is my responsibility now.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.365
I take that duty
with the utmost seriousness.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.161
I must apologize for, uh…

16:38.163 --> 16:38.998
well…

16:39.081 --> 16:40.499
-Shooting at me?
-Indeed.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.542
[Simon chuckles lightly]

16:41.625 --> 16:43.877
I would have thought you dishonorable
had you not.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.463
Besides,
you have always been a terrible shot.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.382
You'd have stood
a greater chance of wounding me

16:48.465 --> 16:50.259
if you had simply fired
straight up in the air.

16:50.342 --> 16:51.844
[chuckles] Your Grace.

16:52.594 --> 16:56.015
May I express my gratitude
for your granting of this special license?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.475
Perhaps, my lord, you should not.

17:00.561 --> 17:01.562
Denied?

17:02.438 --> 17:03.647
What on earth for?

17:03.731 --> 17:07.151
The archbishop of Canterbury
did not think he owed me an explanation.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.737
If we are to wait weeks for this wedding,

17:09.820 --> 17:11.071
it gives Cressida Cowper,

17:11.155 --> 17:14.575
not to mention Whistledown
and anyone else,

17:14.658 --> 17:18.787
far too much time to uncover
the truth of what happened in that garden.

17:20.998 --> 17:21.874
Simon--

17:21.957 --> 17:23.375
Lady Danbury.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.335
Welcome!

17:25.419 --> 17:28.756
Welcome! Is everyone as famished as I?
[chuckles]

17:31.133 --> 17:34.762
Now, this is far too grim a mood
for the celebration I was counting on.

17:34.845 --> 17:37.139
-What on earth is the matter?
-Anthony?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.726
We have been denied our request
for a special license.

17:40.809 --> 17:43.353
-What?
-The archbishop did not see a need.

17:44.229 --> 17:45.522
[Violet inhales sharply]

17:47.441 --> 17:48.859
It is not the archbishop.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.527
It is the queen.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.238
Perhaps she has taken
your rejection of her nephew to heart,

17:53.322 --> 17:55.491
or perhaps she is simply bored.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.994
Either way, it does not bode well
for your daughter's social future,

17:59.078 --> 18:01.288
nor any of the Bridgertons,
for that matter.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.290
Surely we must be able to do something?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.212
Give her what she wants.

18:08.295 --> 18:09.630
Attention.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.175
Appear before her yourselves
and make a personal appeal.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.760
But she will not respond to begging,

18:14.843 --> 18:17.679
and she can sniff out even
the faintest whiff of insincerity,

18:17.763 --> 18:19.848
so do not lay it on thick.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.727
Tell her you are in love,

18:23.811 --> 18:27.481
plain and simple and true.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.486
You can do that, can you not?

18:39.868 --> 18:40.702
Good.

18:41.829 --> 18:45.916
-Now, where is the dinner I was promised?
-[Violet chuckles]

18:59.847 --> 19:01.348
[muffled revelry]

19:03.058 --> 19:05.894
-Bridgerton! I am so glad you came.
-I dare not miss it.

19:05.978 --> 19:06.937
Please, come in.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.859
Make yourself at home.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.903
I would show you around,
but host duty calls.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.113
[Benedict chuckles]

19:16.196 --> 19:17.865
[guests clamoring]

19:40.304 --> 19:42.139
[Genevieve] What are you doing here?

19:44.725 --> 19:46.268
Apologies. Have we met?

19:46.351 --> 19:48.020
We do not need to have met.

19:48.103 --> 19:49.855
You are a Bridgerton, yes?

19:49.938 --> 19:52.107
I see my reputation precedes me.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.401
[ironic chuckle] Not exactly a virtue.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.487
Anything that gets me your attention
is a good thing, I rather think.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.825
You should go,
home to your brother, perhaps.

20:01.909 --> 20:02.868
[chuckling scoff]

20:03.368 --> 20:06.371
But I'm receiving
far too warm a welcome here.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.459
[clamoring continues]

20:10.542 --> 20:11.627
[Benedict panting]

20:12.669 --> 20:14.630
[both grunting, moaning]

20:36.318 --> 20:37.778
[Genevieve whispering] Bridgerton.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.958
[all panting]

20:58.799 --> 20:59.758
[raucous clamoring]

20:59.841 --> 21:04.513
[Simon singing indistinctly]

21:06.473 --> 21:08.684
[Will interrupts] 
Is that how the tune goes?

21:10.727 --> 21:12.437
It's a bloody love song, I think.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.648
Happy to hear you're embracing the genre.

21:14.731 --> 21:15.816
Where is my drink?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.945
Did they kick you out?
My God, they kicked you out--

21:23.448 --> 21:25.450
Will marrying the girl truly be so bad?

21:25.534 --> 21:26.910
I know you care for her.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.997
Feelings are irrelevant.
Indeed, they're responsible for this mess.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.541
I let them get the better of me.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.752
Now she has to fight
for a wedding she doesn't even want.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.672
You think someone
wrote a love song about that?

21:40.299 --> 21:43.385
Hey, tell him
to play the one about the trapped wife!

21:43.468 --> 21:45.721
All right, friend,
time to get you out of here.

21:49.808 --> 21:50.809
[door opens]

21:51.351 --> 21:52.269
[door closes]

21:52.352 --> 21:54.187
[Lady Featherington]
I've invited Lord Rutledge

21:54.271 --> 21:55.272
to dine with us Saturday.

21:55.355 --> 22:00.610
You have until then to muster
appropriate enthusiasm for his proposal.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.362
I could have until Judgment Day

22:02.446 --> 22:05.490
and still not manage a smile
for that wretched fate.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.826
[Lady Featherington]
Despite all obstacles,

22:07.909 --> 22:09.619
I have managed to find a man

22:09.703 --> 22:12.539
who will overlook
your current circumstance

22:12.622 --> 22:14.374
and offer you some security.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.044
You should be lavishing me with gratitude,

22:17.127 --> 22:19.546
and yet you merely sit here and sulk.

22:23.008 --> 22:23.967
Hmm.

22:24.051 --> 22:25.552
Is this about Mr. Bridgerton?

22:27.763 --> 22:28.764
He likes me.

22:29.264 --> 22:31.058
He'll propose to me, I am sure of it.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.976
That boy is barely out of leading strings.

22:33.060 --> 22:35.354
He has two older brothers
still running from the yoke.

22:35.937 --> 22:38.523
You are
to cut Colin Bridgerton immediately,

22:38.607 --> 22:39.983
or I will lock you in this room

22:40.067 --> 22:42.319
till the day
Lord Rutledge makes you his wife.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.738
Lady Featherington, wait.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.700
You are right. You have been kind to me.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.913
And I should like
to repay you for that kindness.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.917
If I were to marry Mr. Bridgerton,

22:57.000 --> 23:02.089
you would be connected to what I gather
is a very powerful family, indeed.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.300
Think what that could do for your girls.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.554
Give me until Saturday.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.642
If I have not secured a proposal
from Mr. Bridgerton by then,

23:13.725 --> 23:18.397
I shall accept Lord Rutledge
with a smile on my face.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.108
My girl, you are
six months away from motherhood,

23:21.191 --> 23:22.526
seven if you're lucky.

23:22.609 --> 23:27.114
And even if a miracle were to occur,
and Colin Bridgerton proposed tomorrow,

23:27.197 --> 23:28.782
the wedding wouldn't be for weeks.

23:30.492 --> 23:31.910
That is only assuming

23:31.993 --> 23:34.621
we wait until the wedding night
to consummate the union.

23:38.375 --> 23:39.876
You will seduce him?

23:41.378 --> 23:42.963
[Marina] I will do what I must.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.636
[Lady Featherington] Very well.
You have until Saturday. 

24:10.115 --> 24:10.949
My king.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.912
No need for the formality, Lottie.
Sit with me.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.628
How is little George?

24:23.712 --> 24:26.006
Well, he is not so little anymore.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.425
Grows plumper by the day, in fact.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.469
I am quite sure he does. [chuckles]

24:33.722 --> 24:35.348
Your subjects miss you, my dear.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.017
I miss you.

24:38.143 --> 24:39.561
I'm right here, Lottie.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.856
I was just remembering
the bluebells in the cottage garden.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.608
-Ah.
-Do you recall when you first saw them?

24:44.691 --> 24:47.486
You said it was
as if we were walking in the clouds.

24:47.569 --> 24:51.198
[chuckles] You had just filled the paddock
with kangaroos, of all things.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.492
-Yes. [laughs]
-Dreadful creatures.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.870
-How are the gardens coming along?
-Oh, they are in full bloom.

24:56.953 --> 24:59.623
After your meal, perhaps we could
take a walk, like we used to do.

24:59.706 --> 25:00.957
And how is dear Emily?

25:02.083 --> 25:03.293
Can you bring her to me?

25:05.629 --> 25:06.546
George…

25:08.715 --> 25:10.008
Amelia was ill…

25:11.134 --> 25:12.344
several years ago.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.723
She came to my room but a fortnight ago.

25:16.806 --> 25:17.891
Did you not see her?

25:19.726 --> 25:21.645
She is gone, George.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.357
What did you…?

25:26.525 --> 25:29.319
Have you done something?
What have you done?

25:29.402 --> 25:31.196
What has this woman done to my child?

25:31.279 --> 25:32.197
George…

25:32.280 --> 25:33.323
No! What have you done?

25:33.990 --> 25:36.117
-What have you done?
-[servant] Your Majesty…

25:36.201 --> 25:37.619
No, you come back here!

25:37.702 --> 25:39.454
She has killed my child!

25:39.538 --> 25:40.497
You bitch!

25:41.206 --> 25:42.165
You bitch!

25:48.838 --> 25:50.340
[exhales]

25:50.423 --> 25:52.133
[sighs deeply]

25:57.514 --> 25:58.932
[sighs]

26:08.024 --> 26:09.442
-[Rose] Miss?
-[Daphne gasps]

26:09.859 --> 26:10.735
Rose.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.530
-Is everything all right?
-I cannot sleep.

26:13.613 --> 26:16.241
It is quite late
for you to be up, too, is it not?

26:16.324 --> 26:17.576
There is much to be done.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.372
If you're nervous about the wedding,
you need not worry.

26:22.455 --> 26:24.374
I assure you,
I am managing everything.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.501
-I will be ready.
-I know you will.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.878
You are not who I worry about.

26:32.674 --> 26:33.508
The duke.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.222
-Has he asked to beg off, miss?
-No.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.308
But he may wish to.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.146
Every man entertains doubt
before the day, I rather think,

26:46.229 --> 26:47.647
but it does not signify.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.983
He will be a good husband to you.

26:50.734 --> 26:51.901
A good father as well.

26:53.194 --> 26:54.487
[quivering inhale]

26:54.571 --> 26:55.405
Miss?

26:57.741 --> 26:59.200
He cannot have children.

27:01.328 --> 27:05.540
I shall not pretend to understand
the extent of his physical impediment,

27:05.624 --> 27:09.669
but I imagine it is a source
of great pain for the duke, indeed.

27:13.381 --> 27:16.676
I have an aunt.
She lives in Greenwich with her husband.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.430
They have been married for ten years now
and never blessed with children,

27:20.513 --> 27:23.725
but they still are to each other
as husband and wife.

27:24.559 --> 27:28.271
-Theirs is a happy union.
-Because they love each other.

27:30.398 --> 27:31.816
At least your aunt has that.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.989
I shall not keep you, Rose.
You must have a hundred things to do.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.241
Of course, miss. Good night.

27:43.870 --> 27:44.913
[sighs]

27:53.380 --> 27:54.589
You smell bad.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.883
[Alice] Nicky! Stop pestering him.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.510
[baby coos]

28:00.095 --> 28:02.222
[Simon grunts, sniffs]

28:05.100 --> 28:07.894
Why must everything be so bright?

28:07.977 --> 28:09.813
It is called "day" for a reason.

28:09.896 --> 28:12.315
Charcoal and oil will soak up
everything in your gut.

28:13.608 --> 28:14.484
Eat.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.408
If I am, in fact, to marry…

28:22.659 --> 28:24.494
I would like
the both of you to be present.

28:24.577 --> 28:27.664
"If"? He seems to believe
there is a way out of this.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.458
[chuckles] We would be honored to attend.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.419
Good.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.213
[Alice] Have you told the duke
about your exhibition series business?

28:35.296 --> 28:36.339
Alice…

28:36.423 --> 28:39.092
Will is seeking more investors
for a series of matches.

28:39.175 --> 28:40.719
Perhaps, Your Grace,

28:40.802 --> 28:44.639
you and your future brother-in-law
might be interested in investing?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.767
The viscount certainly owes you something
after shooting at you.

28:47.851 --> 28:48.727
-Alice!
-What?

28:48.810 --> 28:51.771
I am sure His Grace understands
the basic tenets of marriage,

28:51.855 --> 28:53.022
or at least he will.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.484
Everything you know, I know.
And everything I know…

28:56.568 --> 28:58.194
Well, you eventually catch up.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.655
-[Simon chuckles]
-Pay her no mind.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.449
That's what I do. [chuckles]

29:04.075 --> 29:05.368
[Will, Alice laughing]

29:06.286 --> 29:09.456
-Ah!
-Right, dears, come on. Out you go.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.717
[dogs panting]

29:25.263 --> 29:26.431
[dog barks softly]

29:32.687 --> 29:34.814
As low as you can go, Lady Danbury?

29:34.898 --> 29:37.776
With these knees, yes, Your Majesty.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.819
Very well.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.281
Let your young people come forward.

29:53.583 --> 29:54.793
I have heard a rumor

29:54.876 --> 29:58.338
that the special license
you seek to marry has been denied.

29:59.464 --> 30:02.509
I am not quite sure
what you believe I am to do about it.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.556
Well, plead your case.

30:09.265 --> 30:13.770
Your Majesty, I assure you
nothing untoward has occurred.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.440
It is only that
we love each other so very much.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.108
[sighs]

30:21.486 --> 30:23.321
While I was deeply flattered

30:23.404 --> 30:25.448
by the attention
of your nephew, the prince,

30:25.532 --> 30:26.783
I…

30:26.866 --> 30:30.203
I simply could not ignore
my long-standing affection for the duke.

30:32.247 --> 30:35.500
You see, Your Majesty,
it was love at first sight.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.335
It was not, Your Majesty.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.049
The young lady flatters me,

30:43.550 --> 30:46.511
but it was not love at first sight
for either of us.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.515
There was attraction,
certainly, at least on my part.

30:51.224 --> 30:55.144
But Miss Bridgerton thought me
presumptuous, arrogant, insincere.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.104
All fair, really.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.107
And I thought her a prim young lady
barely out of leading strings.

30:59.899 --> 31:01.609
Not to mention
the sister of my best friend,

31:01.693 --> 31:04.696
and so romance was entirely
out of the question for both of us.

31:04.779 --> 31:05.947
But in so removing it,

31:06.030 --> 31:07.949
we found something far greater.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.368
We found friendship.

31:11.411 --> 31:15.331
You see, Miss Bridgerton and I have been
fooling all of Mayfair for some time.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.751
We have fooled them
into thinking we are courting…

31:19.711 --> 31:21.337
when really, all along,

31:22.046 --> 31:23.882
we simply enjoyed
each other's company so much

31:23.965 --> 31:25.717
we could not stay away from one another.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.226
I have never been a man
that much enjoyed flirting, or chatting,

31:35.310 --> 31:38.187
or, indeed, talking at all.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.397
But with Daphne…

31:40.315 --> 31:41.482
Miss Bridgerton…

31:43.109 --> 31:44.986
conversation has always been easy.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.323
Her laughter brings me joy.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.201
To meet a beautiful woman is one thing,

31:52.285 --> 31:54.871
but to meet your best friend
in the most beautiful of women

31:54.954 --> 31:57.332
is something entirely apart.

31:57.415 --> 32:01.669
And it is with my sincerest apologies,
I must say it took the prince coming along

32:01.753 --> 32:05.548
for me to realize I did not want
Miss Bridgerton to only be my friend.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.300
I wanted her to be my wife.

32:11.846 --> 32:13.890
I want her to be my wife.

32:15.975 --> 32:17.518
And so I plead with you…

32:18.311 --> 32:19.771
not to make us wait.

32:24.943 --> 32:25.860
Simon…

32:26.402 --> 32:27.987
[Queen Charlotte] You are wise…

32:28.655 --> 32:31.032
or perhaps unusually lucky
to understand friendship

32:31.115 --> 32:34.369
to be the best possible foundation
a marriage can have.

32:36.162 --> 32:39.290
Even if that foundation should crumble
as quickly as it was built.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.795
I shall like to offer you the choice,
Miss Bridgerton.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.215
Do you wish to marry this man?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.396
[attendees whispering]

33:06.985 --> 33:07.902
[door opens]

33:52.864 --> 33:53.948
Dearly beloved,

33:54.907 --> 33:56.659
we are gathered to join together

33:56.743 --> 34:00.288
this man and this woman in holy matrimony.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.416
It is said that marriage hath in it

34:04.125 --> 34:09.297
less of beauty
but more of safety than the single life.

34:10.590 --> 34:14.218
[dramatic choral music plays]

34:45.708 --> 34:50.463
…in the name of the Father,
of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

34:51.506 --> 34:54.175
I now pronounce you man and wife.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.098
[upbeat classical violin music plays]

35:00.181 --> 35:02.517
[guests conversing]

35:18.366 --> 35:22.161
[woman 1] It was such a beautiful wedding.
Thank you for having us.

35:22.245 --> 35:23.454
[woman 2] Your Grace.

35:29.001 --> 35:32.463
I suppose congratulations are in order.
[chuckles]

35:32.547 --> 35:33.965
We being friends, after all.

35:34.590 --> 35:39.554
I do hope you will remember my kindness
in keeping secrets and repay me someday.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.015
Enjoy your triumph, Your Grace.

35:45.434 --> 35:46.519
What about him?

35:46.602 --> 35:47.520
He seems…

35:49.313 --> 35:50.273
pleasant.

35:52.191 --> 35:53.276
[gasps]

35:53.359 --> 35:54.735
Or him.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.529
Kind eyes.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.239
A fine enough husband, I think.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.325
Pen, I neither know nor have time
for any of these men.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.827
Now, where is Colin?

36:05.079 --> 36:06.581
You can choose anyone but him.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.711
He is my friend, Marina.
I have known him forever.

36:12.587 --> 36:16.465
And I do not want him to be tricked
and deceived into a lifelong commitment.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.426
You must not do this to a good man.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.388
Well, should I perhaps
entrap a bad man, then?

36:23.472 --> 36:25.016
Perhaps you would find it acceptable

36:25.099 --> 36:27.727
for me to live my life with a man
who treats me like a mere beast?

36:27.810 --> 36:30.104
-No, I only mean--
-What am I to do, Penelope?

36:30.188 --> 36:31.772
I will be a good wife to Colin,

36:31.856 --> 36:33.900
and he a good husband and father…

36:34.775 --> 36:37.528
however young
and well-liked by you he may be.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.822
Miss Thompson,
you will be delighted to know

36:39.906 --> 36:42.074
that Lord Rutledge is no longer available.

36:42.575 --> 36:45.703
He is engaged as of this morning.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.247
That is…

36:48.331 --> 36:49.290
How terrible.

36:49.373 --> 36:52.460
Best hope that whatever you have planned
for Mr. Bridgerton actually works.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.212
It is your last hope.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.804
[inaudible conversation]

37:07.642 --> 37:08.809
Oh! [Penelope gasps]

37:13.356 --> 37:14.815
-I should--
-As should I.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.409
I am beginning to feel a bit faint.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.995
Perhaps you know
of a more private place

37:28.079 --> 37:30.122
where I might catch my breath?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.333
Certainly, Miss Thompson. Please.

37:43.469 --> 37:44.679
[Marina] Hmm.

37:44.762 --> 37:48.015
-[guests clamoring]
-This is much more comfortable. Thank you.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.935
Though it is still quite loud.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.812
Oh, of course.

37:59.068 --> 38:00.444
[Colin breathes deeply]

38:03.030 --> 38:06.075
-We should not be alone in here.
-No, we should not.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.828
Hmm.

38:25.678 --> 38:29.432
I can hardly believe I am saying this,
but we cannot go further.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.226
You are a lady,

38:32.310 --> 38:35.021
and I must maintain your honor and mine,

38:36.105 --> 38:39.191
no matter how… tempting otherwise.

38:43.696 --> 38:46.407
-Have I offended you?
-No. [chuckles]

38:46.490 --> 38:47.408
You are right.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.160
I am a lady.

38:49.785 --> 38:51.120
I am unmarried.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.080
And you…

38:53.998 --> 38:55.374
You are…

38:57.460 --> 38:58.794
a gentleman.

39:02.548 --> 39:03.424
Then marry me.

39:05.134 --> 39:08.095
I know we have only known each other
a short while, but…

39:08.888 --> 39:10.806
Well, would you want to marry me,
Miss Thompson?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.977
I would be delighted to marry you!

39:15.061 --> 39:16.854
-What are we waiting for?
-My thoughts exactly.

39:16.937 --> 39:18.439
We will marry by the end of the season.

39:19.565 --> 39:22.360
-It's a rather long engagement.
-Or simply romantic.

39:22.443 --> 39:26.030
You deserve a grand wedding.
Our families will need time to plan.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.741
-It will be wonderful, I promise you.
-[chuckles]

39:29.283 --> 39:31.452
But let us not say anything now.

39:32.161 --> 39:33.204
It is my sister's day.

39:34.914 --> 39:35.998
Of course.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.958
[chuckles]

39:41.879 --> 39:42.922
[chuckles softly]

39:55.226 --> 39:56.394
Your Majesty.

39:57.645 --> 40:01.190
I must say, I am honored
and most grateful for your presence.

40:01.273 --> 40:04.151
And I must say,
I hope you made the right choice.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.403
Well, either way,

40:05.486 --> 40:08.781
I suppose you will enjoy
your wedding night, at the very least.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.206
Yes, you certainly enjoy
spreading secrets, do you not?

40:17.289 --> 40:20.543
Dear child, have you lost your wits?
Everyone enjoys secrets.

40:20.626 --> 40:24.171
Otherwise, why would
Lady Whistledown's paper be so successful?

40:24.255 --> 40:26.340
I am flattered by your accusation,

40:26.424 --> 40:28.634
but it is simply not true.

40:28.717 --> 40:30.970
Though, when you unmask the writer,

40:31.053 --> 40:32.221
do let me know.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.559
You believe Whistledown is Lady Danbury?

40:38.394 --> 40:40.020
[gasps] Your Majesty.

40:40.646 --> 40:42.398
What evidence have you gathered?

40:44.483 --> 40:45.693
You would like to know…

40:46.485 --> 40:47.945
what evidence I have gathered

40:48.028 --> 40:50.156
in my investigation of Lady Whistledown?

40:50.239 --> 40:52.324
Are you requiring your queen 
to ask again?

40:52.408 --> 40:53.576
Oh…

40:53.659 --> 40:55.161
Tell me what you know.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.581
Well, I believe her a widow.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.292
She obviously has the financial means…

41:07.673 --> 41:10.593
-A most enjoyable party.
-Indeed.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.721
Um, Bridgerton… Um…

41:14.972 --> 41:16.140
The other night…

41:16.223 --> 41:19.935
What happened the other night?
I do not believe anything happened at all.

41:21.812 --> 41:22.938
Ah…

41:23.731 --> 41:24.815
Very well.

41:25.274 --> 41:28.110
Ah, dearest…
I believe you know Mr. Bridgerton.

41:30.029 --> 41:32.448
My wife, Mrs. Lucy Granville.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.409
It is a pleasure, Mr. Bridgerton.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.661
Mm.

41:44.752 --> 41:46.253
I spoke to the duke.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.922
That makes one of us.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.465
He refused your dowry.

41:50.799 --> 41:53.344
Is this your attempt to raise my spirits?

41:53.427 --> 41:55.179
He refused for your benefit, sister.

41:55.262 --> 41:58.265
I shall put the money in trust,
so you may use it how you see fit.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.558
For your children, perhaps.

42:00.643 --> 42:04.146
Certainly, you two will have a brood
large enough to put Mother's to shame.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.983
-What? Is something wrong?
-I am…

42:09.318 --> 42:11.987
This is all…
I must take a moment. Excuse me.

42:22.665 --> 42:24.667
[breathing heavily]

42:27.836 --> 42:29.088
[knocking at door]

42:31.382 --> 42:32.675
[Violet chuckles lightly]

42:34.677 --> 42:37.054
I know it must be difficult
to be leaving this house.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.431
I have many memories here.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.517
And you will make new ones
with your husband.

42:43.143 --> 42:44.645
Ah, my husband.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.858
Seems so strange
to finally be able to say that.

42:50.985 --> 42:54.113
I suppose I have put this conversation off
for as long as I can.

42:54.196 --> 42:55.531
[chuckles nervously]

42:59.785 --> 43:01.203
On my wedding day,

43:01.287 --> 43:05.374
I insisted Cook bring out
round after round of food,

43:05.457 --> 43:08.544
in part because I did not want
the celebration to end, but…

43:09.378 --> 43:11.297
if I must confess,

43:11.380 --> 43:13.132
I was also quite apprehensive…

43:14.550 --> 43:16.135
of my wedding night.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.306
In fact, I was quite full
by the time we got to Aubrey Hall.

43:20.389 --> 43:22.391
I certainly do not recommend that.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.729
Well, what do you recommend, Mama?

43:27.521 --> 43:28.772
I know you and the duke--

43:28.856 --> 43:31.108
Well, whatever took place
between the two of you…

43:31.191 --> 43:33.652
You may very well
know some things already.

43:33.736 --> 43:36.238
I know nothing, I assure you.

43:36.822 --> 43:39.867
Well, there are some things
you ought to know.

43:40.951 --> 43:43.203
Some things that will happen

43:43.287 --> 43:46.457
that involve you and your husband…

43:46.540 --> 43:49.001
The duke, obviously.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.545
Well, he… You see…

43:52.630 --> 43:53.756
the marital act,

43:53.839 --> 43:58.552
which, now that you are married,
you may perform…

43:59.094 --> 44:03.015
If it is this difficult to discuss,
how difficult must it be to perform?

44:03.098 --> 44:06.685
It is not, dearest. It is most natural.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.689
Much in the way
that rain soaks a field in autumn,

44:10.773 --> 44:12.858
and in spring, flowers grow.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.613
-[Violet grunts uncomfortably]
-[Daphne inhales]

44:18.447 --> 44:22.826
When you were younger, do you remember,
we had two hounds in the country?

44:22.910 --> 44:25.621
-[chuckles] Bassets, in fact.
-That is right.

44:25.704 --> 44:27.581
Well, no one explained it to them…

44:28.540 --> 44:30.000
but there were puppies.

44:32.753 --> 44:33.879
I see. So…

44:34.421 --> 44:36.965
So, this act,
it is performed to have children?

44:37.049 --> 44:40.010
Yes! [laughs, sighs]

44:42.137 --> 44:43.013
But…

44:43.847 --> 44:46.141
what if the duke
and I cannot have children?

44:47.226 --> 44:50.521
Does that prevent us
from performing this act at all,

44:50.604 --> 44:53.023
from even having a wedding night at all?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.900
Dear, is this your concern?

44:55.401 --> 44:56.402
[chuckles]

44:57.277 --> 45:00.280
Daphne, the two of you
care for each other deeply.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.740
When all is said and done,

45:01.824 --> 45:03.534
nothing else matters.

45:04.076 --> 45:05.994
There is no reason to be concerned.

45:06.078 --> 45:07.246
[chuckles]

45:07.788 --> 45:10.541
-I still have so many questions, Mama.
-[knocking at door]

45:12.626 --> 45:16.088
-They are bringing the carriages around.
-It is time.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.590
[sighs]

45:24.221 --> 45:27.099
Perhaps I can come with you.
I've always wanted to live in a castle.

45:27.182 --> 45:30.853
If Daphne is going to take anyone
with her, Gregory, it will be me.

45:30.936 --> 45:34.189
The two of you are staying here
until our dear sister allows us a visit.

45:34.773 --> 45:39.236
You mean if she allows us a visit.
I'm sure you'll enjoy the peace and quiet.

45:39.319 --> 45:41.822
I am going to miss all of you terribly.

45:41.905 --> 45:43.115
Even me?

45:43.824 --> 45:44.658
Even you.

45:49.955 --> 45:51.498
I have a present for you.

45:52.332 --> 45:55.753
It is upstairs, made of four walls
and a very comfortable bed.

45:57.963 --> 46:00.466
I suppose
the light in your room is quite pleasant.

46:02.134 --> 46:06.555
I know we could not be any more different,
but there is one thing we do share,

46:07.055 --> 46:09.558
the certainty that you will make
your own way in this world.

46:10.225 --> 46:11.643
I am sure of it, Eloise.

46:26.950 --> 46:30.078
-Write to me as soon as you arrive.
-Of course, Mama.

46:33.123 --> 46:35.250
You are going to be a wonderful duchess.

46:45.803 --> 46:46.929
[carriage door opens]

47:03.987 --> 47:06.406
-[carriage door closes]
-[horse whinnies]

47:21.547 --> 47:22.589
[sighs]

47:23.131 --> 47:25.217
We should reach the inn before nightfall.

47:26.969 --> 47:28.178
The inn?

47:28.262 --> 47:31.807
Clyvedon is much too far a journey,
and the roads are not safe after dusk.

47:31.890 --> 47:34.101
We need to rest
before continuing on in the morning.

47:34.184 --> 47:37.187
So we will be spending
our wedding night at the inn?

47:38.772 --> 47:39.648
Why…

47:41.483 --> 47:43.068
I should have told you.

47:43.944 --> 47:44.903
Not at all.

47:50.701 --> 47:51.702
[sighs]

48:26.361 --> 48:28.155
I do hope everything is to your liking.

48:28.238 --> 48:31.909
Should you require anything else at all,
please let me know.

48:33.535 --> 48:34.494
Ah, here we are.

48:39.917 --> 48:42.794
-Your room, Your Grace, is just over here.
-[inhales sharply]

48:46.840 --> 48:48.508
I requested a separate room.

48:49.676 --> 48:50.510
Yes.

48:52.721 --> 48:53.847
-Should I--
-Yes.

48:53.931 --> 48:54.848
Yes.

48:59.519 --> 49:01.313
[panting rapidly]

49:38.892 --> 49:40.811
We should go down to dinner.

49:40.894 --> 49:42.312
[sighs deeply]

49:42.396 --> 49:44.022
Daphne? I…

49:45.399 --> 49:47.901
Are you not hungry?
The food is excellent here, I assure you.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.779
-The last time I visited--
-I do not want any dinner!

49:53.991 --> 49:57.452
I have spent the last three days
wanting to be alone with you,

49:57.536 --> 50:00.664
wanting to talk to you, wanting to know.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.002
I understand
that you do not wish to see me,

50:05.502 --> 50:07.879
that you would prefer to stay
in your separate room

50:07.963 --> 50:11.091
and endure a wordless dinner together
on our wedding night, but I--

50:11.174 --> 50:13.343
-That is not what I would prefer.
-Simon--

50:13.427 --> 50:14.553
You are mistaken.

50:17.347 --> 50:21.059
-You have avoided my presence.
-In order to allow you your liberty.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.854
You have said all but a few words to me.

50:23.937 --> 50:26.189
In order to keep myself
from saying the wrong things.

50:26.273 --> 50:28.066
You've barely been able
to look me in the eye.

50:28.150 --> 50:30.527
I could not bear witness
to the misery I have caused you.

50:30.610 --> 50:31.570
You did not…

50:33.655 --> 50:36.450
I am the one
who trapped you into this marriage.

50:36.533 --> 50:37.951
I trapped you.

50:41.997 --> 50:44.916
I have spent the last three days in agony…

50:46.043 --> 50:48.587
unable to talk to you,
unable to be alone with you,

50:48.670 --> 50:52.466
because I knew
you wanted nothing to do with me.

50:53.425 --> 50:56.386
And understandably so, after forcing you
to make an unimaginable sacrifice.

50:56.470 --> 50:59.639
You wanted a life with children, a family.

51:00.390 --> 51:02.142
You wanted a life
with a man you truly knew.

51:02.225 --> 51:05.812
You wanted a love match, and yet--

51:05.896 --> 51:06.730
And yet…

51:07.397 --> 51:09.274
this could not be any more different.

51:11.610 --> 51:13.070
Is that what you hoped to say?

51:17.657 --> 51:18.658
[exhales sharply]

51:19.409 --> 51:21.828
I shall join you for dinner momentarily.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.832
[sighs tremulously]

51:26.792 --> 51:29.044
Everything I told the queen was true.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.466
I cannot stop thinking of you.

51:36.051 --> 51:39.554
From the mornings you ease,
to the evenings you quiet,

51:39.638 --> 51:41.723
to the dreams you inhabit…

51:43.558 --> 51:45.352
my thoughts of you never end.

51:48.772 --> 51:50.107
I am yours, Daphne.

51:51.483 --> 51:52.859
I have always been yours.

51:54.236 --> 51:55.403
I…

51:57.447 --> 51:59.074
I do not understand.

51:59.699 --> 52:01.284
I do not know how to be any more clear.

52:01.368 --> 52:03.662
-Do not get angry.
-I am not angry. I--

52:03.745 --> 52:06.998
You look angry and bothered.
Look at you, you are downright flushed.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.251
-Yes, that is what happens.
-When one is angry.

52:09.334 --> 52:11.878
When one burns for someone
who does not feel the same!

52:13.046 --> 52:14.131
[Simon sighs]

52:14.214 --> 52:15.048
You…

52:15.632 --> 52:16.591
burn for me?

52:18.093 --> 52:20.512
Why do you think
I followed you into that garden?

52:20.595 --> 52:22.597
Why do you think I went into that garden?

52:24.599 --> 52:27.602
If you would have only
looked at me this week

52:27.686 --> 52:30.689
for longer than two seconds,
you would have seen.

52:33.108 --> 52:35.235
It is you I cannot sacrifice.

52:37.821 --> 52:39.030
I burn…

52:40.073 --> 52:41.158
for you.

52:42.242 --> 52:44.161
[soft romantic music plays]

52:56.256 --> 52:58.091
[both breathing passionately]

53:04.514 --> 53:05.849
[whispering] What are you…

53:05.932 --> 53:08.143
-Simon?
-Do you want me to stop?

53:08.727 --> 53:09.895
No. [gasps]

53:12.272 --> 53:13.648
Do you want me to stop?

53:17.444 --> 53:18.904
I want to show you more.

53:20.071 --> 53:21.072
More?

53:26.161 --> 53:28.163
[both breathing heavily]

53:46.723 --> 53:48.308
[Daphne breathing tremulously]

54:52.664 --> 54:54.040
[both sighing]

54:56.626 --> 54:58.211
Did you touch yourself…

54:58.837 --> 55:00.005
like we talked about?

55:03.341 --> 55:04.175
Show me.

55:05.343 --> 55:06.511
I…

55:07.387 --> 55:08.596
I cannot.

55:22.861 --> 55:24.654
[quivering sigh]

55:27.574 --> 55:28.491
[gasps]

55:28.575 --> 55:31.703
Tell me what you thought about
when you were alone.

55:31.786 --> 55:34.748
[gasping] I thought about…

55:35.248 --> 55:36.166
[inhales sharply]

55:37.083 --> 55:38.835
Simon, I need you closer.

55:52.098 --> 55:53.183
[inhales deeply]

55:54.309 --> 55:55.226
[gasps]

56:12.452 --> 56:14.037
This may hurt a moment.

56:22.337 --> 56:23.546
[Daphne gasps sharply]

56:24.130 --> 56:26.591
[Daphne grunts, moans]

56:32.180 --> 56:33.973
[gasps, moans]

56:48.988 --> 56:52.200
[soft romantic music continues]

56:57.789 --> 56:59.499
[both gasping]

57:01.042 --> 57:02.252
I thought about you.

57:03.586 --> 57:06.923
When I touch myself,
I always think about you.

57:07.006 --> 57:09.050
[gasping intensifies]

57:11.970 --> 57:14.681
[gasping intensifies]

57:19.936 --> 57:22.814
[gasping crescendos]

57:26.401 --> 57:28.820
[Daphne moans]

57:32.115 --> 57:34.033
[both breathing heavily]

57:38.955 --> 57:40.165
[Daphne chuckles]

57:40.248 --> 57:41.291
How do you feel?

57:41.374 --> 57:42.459
I feel…

57:44.794 --> 57:46.337
[chuckles] I feel…

57:47.088 --> 57:48.214
wonderful.

57:49.549 --> 57:50.967
[chuckles]

57:52.177 --> 57:53.261
[sighs]
