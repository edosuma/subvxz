00:56.857 --> 00:59.458
Oh... cute.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.427
Oh, I know,
I love this hat.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.929
And did you see this one, too,
it's really special.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.230
Look at that.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.632
Oh, my grandson
will love that.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.978
Well, we have lots
of kids' sizes, too.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.568
Oh, great.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.773
Oh, look at this one.
It has little candy canes on it.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.710
You know, I think I have
the perfect hat for you.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.345
You want to come
check it out?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.484
Look at that one.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.191
Oh, hi, Mr. Bowers.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.959
Can I help you
with anything?

01:34.028 --> 01:35.668
Oh, no, I just love
coming into the store,

01:35.729 --> 01:38.430
seeing the customers
enjoying the merchandise.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.365
It's what it's all about.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.900
I agree, it's
my favorite part, too.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.669
And how are you
handling things here?

01:43.737 --> 01:46.238
Well, I'll admit,
we've been a little busy.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.974
Oh, and I'm working on
those invoices for you, sorry.

01:49.043 --> 01:50.843
No need to explain, Mia.

01:50.911 --> 01:52.189
I know you've been trying
to pick up the slack

01:52.213 --> 01:53.779
ever since George left us,

01:53.848 --> 01:54.913
and I appreciate it.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.850
In fact, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.017
Really?

01:59.086 --> 02:00.819
Stop by my office
tomorrow morning.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.589
I have some ideas about
the future of the company

02:03.657 --> 02:05.657
I would like to, uh...

02:05.726 --> 02:07.693
Run by you.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.495
Great.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.300
Merry Christmas to me.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.347
It's actually
only October, dear.

02:17.371 --> 02:20.172
Oh, yeah, no,
I know, I was just...

02:20.241 --> 02:22.040
Well, it is
always Christmas

02:22.109 --> 02:23.542
here at hats off!

02:23.611 --> 02:25.077
Here, let me
ring these up for you.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.189
Oh, you got
the light-up one!

02:26.213 --> 02:28.180
Great.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.590
Hi, kiddo.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.558
What?

02:39.627 --> 02:42.261
You couldn't wait for me
for dinner?

02:42.329 --> 02:43.562
Mom, I tried, really.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.164
For 10 whole minutes,

02:45.232 --> 02:46.732
but I just got too hungry.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.599
It's okay.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.201
I appreciate the sacrifice.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.869
Hey, I'm going to go
tell Ellie bye,

02:50.938 --> 02:52.618
and then I'll come back
and join you, okay?

02:57.711 --> 02:58.644
Hey.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.379
Hey...

03:00.447 --> 03:01.880
You made dinner?

03:01.949 --> 03:04.082
What would I do without you?

03:04.151 --> 03:06.351
You know, if you'd agree
to just meet my boss,

03:06.420 --> 03:07.653
you wouldn't need me at all.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.754
I told you,

03:08.822 --> 03:11.156
I don't want to be
a market research analyst.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.293
Okay, yes, I admit,
that sounds dry.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.361
It does, yeah.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.197
But you're good with numbers
and merchandise,

03:18.265 --> 03:19.543
and you know
what customers like.

03:19.567 --> 03:20.677
I think you'd
really take to it.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.534
And then you could make
your own hours

03:22.603 --> 03:24.269
and spend more time
at home with Scotty.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.671
Well, thank you,

03:25.739 --> 03:27.706
but I think I might be
getting a better job

03:27.775 --> 03:28.674
down at the store.

03:28.742 --> 03:29.742
Really?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.212
Yeah, Mr. Bowers said
he wants to talk to me,

03:33.280 --> 03:34.457
about the future
of the company.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.415
I don't know, I feel like

03:36.483 --> 03:39.318
I'm finally getting my chance
at upper management.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.687
Oh, well, it's about time,

03:41.755 --> 03:42.955
and you completely deserve it.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.724
Thank you.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.726
Now, go get out of here
and go have your own life.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.039
I'm going to go
eat dinner with my son,

03:49.063 --> 03:52.264
and then pass out
from exhaustion.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.899
Sounds like
a plan.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.588
Hi, Sam.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.055
Hey, Mia.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.291
Phil.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.503
Hi. You going
to see the boss?

04:20.527 --> 04:21.994
I am.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.582
Would you like me
to pass on a message?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.551
Yeah, let's make Friday donuts
an everyday thing.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.068
Easier to get up to
Santa weight by Christmas.

04:29.637 --> 04:30.869
Will do.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.838
You know, we could
pad the Santa suit, Phil.

04:32.906 --> 04:33.805
You don't have to put
your health at risk every year

04:33.874 --> 04:35.073
for the sake
of authenticity.

04:35.142 --> 04:37.643
It's a risk
I'm willing to take.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.383
"Mr. Bowers...

04:44.451 --> 04:46.029
"Thank you so much
for having faith in me.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.919
"I know the company
has been through a lot

04:47.988 --> 04:49.321
"in these last couple years

04:49.390 --> 04:52.658
"and I'm really looking forward
to accepting this challenge...

04:52.726 --> 04:54.493
This opportunity."

04:54.561 --> 04:58.563
This wonderful opportunity.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.434
Okay.

05:05.339 --> 05:06.772
Morning, Joann.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.206
Oh, good morning, Mia.

05:08.275 --> 05:09.608
Go on in,
he's waiting for you.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.577
Thank you.

05:17.384 --> 05:18.784
Mr. Bowers?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.586
Good morning!

05:21.655 --> 05:22.754
Come on in,

05:22.823 --> 05:24.156
and have a seat.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.057
Thank you.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.460
Well, now...

05:30.564 --> 05:34.032
And how long have you
been with us, Mia?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.802
Well, I started part-time
my sophomore year in high school

05:36.870 --> 05:38.503
and then bumped up to full-time,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.539
and assistant manager,

05:40.607 --> 05:41.673
and manager

05:41.742 --> 05:43.842
for the last
three years.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.277
So, in total...

05:45.346 --> 05:46.578
About 10 years.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.447
And that is what
I love to hear,

05:48.515 --> 05:50.248
because this company
is a community, Mia,

05:50.317 --> 05:52.351
built on the backs
of loyal employees

05:52.419 --> 05:53.419
just like yourself.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.255
Which brings me to my point.

05:57.324 --> 05:59.157
Well, I realize
when George retired

05:59.226 --> 06:00.826
and he left you with
a bit of a mess,

06:00.894 --> 06:02.574
and that's not part of
your job description

06:02.629 --> 06:03.729
to play CFO.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.764
I've just been doing
the best that I could.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.711
You know, 40 years,
we were friends and colleagues,

06:07.735 --> 06:11.470
and George was sharp as a tack
up until the last couple of...

06:12.940 --> 06:16.308
I'm sorry I didn't notice sooner
how much he was struggling...

06:17.711 --> 06:19.945
Well...

06:20.013 --> 06:21.391
Combined with the recession,
the increased competition,

06:21.415 --> 06:23.348
well, you know
how the sales have been.

06:23.417 --> 06:24.983
Well, the last
two Christmases...

06:25.052 --> 06:26.218
Were soft.

06:26.286 --> 06:27.964
We didn't do enough business
to put us in the black,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.428
and this year
has not been promising.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.991
The bank has been
breathing down my neck,

06:33.060 --> 06:34.693
and if I don't turn it around,

06:34.762 --> 06:36.428
this Christmas
could be our last.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.330
Oh, that would be terrible.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.665
Yes, but we are not
going down

06:40.734 --> 06:43.368
without a fight,

06:43.437 --> 06:45.971
because we have someone
to step up,

06:46.039 --> 06:47.406
make sense of the books,

06:47.474 --> 06:49.107
and put us right back

06:49.176 --> 06:50.809
on track.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.178
I am more than ready,
Mr. Bowers.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.713
I have so many ideas...

06:54.782 --> 06:55.782
Wonderful,

06:55.816 --> 06:57.416
and I'm sure Nick
will love to hear them.

06:57.918 --> 06:58.817
Nick?

06:58.886 --> 07:01.553
My pride and joy,
my one and only son.

07:01.622 --> 07:02.988
He's a big shot
business consultant

07:03.056 --> 07:04.423
in New York City.

07:04.491 --> 07:05.390
A Princeton undergrad,

07:05.459 --> 07:06.625
a Columbia MBA.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.127
He's coming here?

07:09.196 --> 07:10.996
Yeah, I'll admit
it took some convincing.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.564
We haven't always seen
eye to eye,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.299
but I got him to agree

07:14.368 --> 07:16.401
to come whip this place
back into shape,

07:16.470 --> 07:17.536
and he gets in tomorrow.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.939
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowers,
but I don't really understand.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.841
I mean, Nick's
coming here to take over,

07:22.910 --> 07:25.544
what do you need from me?

07:26.213 --> 07:29.448
I need you to, um...

07:29.516 --> 07:30.849
Mentor him.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.651
Show him the ropes.

07:32.719 --> 07:34.397
Nick hasn't been home much
since high school.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.555
I mean, he's a shark
when it comes to business,

07:36.623 --> 07:38.601
but I don't want him picking
hats off to Christmas apart

07:38.625 --> 07:40.465
the way he does
those companies on wall street.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.561
He should be
on the floor

07:42.629 --> 07:44.196
meeting customers.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.998
Or in the warehouse
dealing with orders.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.835
I want him to be
part of this community.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.269
right.

07:51.338 --> 07:55.006
People like you are
the heart of this business, Mia,

07:55.075 --> 07:56.686
and if he's going to
fill in George's shoes,

07:56.710 --> 07:58.643
and, ultimately, mine,

07:58.712 --> 08:00.356
then Nick has to learn
that part of the job

08:00.380 --> 08:03.081
as much as the bank statements
and the invoices.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.650
And you...

08:07.087 --> 08:09.020
Will do great,

08:09.089 --> 08:10.255
like you always do.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.860
Well, thank you, Mr. Bowers,

08:14.928 --> 08:16.828
for having faith in me,

08:16.897 --> 08:19.698
and I look forward to...

08:19.766 --> 08:21.166
Accepting this challenge.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.223
Merry Christmas.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.427
I brought you
a celebratory hot chocolate!

08:49.496 --> 08:50.795
With whipped cream.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.763
Thank you,

08:51.832 --> 08:53.565
but there's nothing
to celebrate.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.733
What?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.769
Come here.

08:58.772 --> 08:59.883
Terry, would you mind
watching the front desk?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.840
Thank you.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.379
He didn't offer me the job.

09:07.447 --> 09:10.348
No, he offered me "a" job,
sort of.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.449
You lost me.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.351
I'm not moving into
upper management,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.253
but I'm training

09:15.322 --> 09:16.454
the guy who is...

09:16.523 --> 09:17.656
Mr. Bowers' son.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.990
Nick?

09:19.059 --> 09:19.891
You know him?

09:19.960 --> 09:20.825
Oh, yeah.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.027
Of course, I know him,

09:22.095 --> 09:24.062
the prodigal son
of hats off to Christmas?

09:24.131 --> 09:26.031
He was a senior
when I was a junior.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.577
He was the most
popular guy in school,

09:27.601 --> 09:29.034
quarterback
of the football team,

09:29.102 --> 09:30.669
homecoming
and prom king.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.897
All the girls loved with him.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.138
To be honest,

09:33.206 --> 09:34.717
I always thought
he was really arrogant.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.975
Yeah, he's apparently
some fancy financial consultant

09:37.044 --> 09:38.044
in New York City.

09:39.846 --> 09:40.890
He doesn't even need the job

09:40.914 --> 09:42.392
and I have to train him
to be good at it.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.915
Have you considered sabotage?

09:45.152 --> 09:46.851
I cannot even believe
you would say that.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.931
I'm just saying, all right,

09:47.955 --> 09:48.887
he's barely made it home
since high school.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.021
Something tells me

09:50.090 --> 09:51.656
it wouldn't be too hard

09:51.725 --> 09:53.291
to run him
back out of town.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.993
Ellie, you're bad.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.667
Hey, this was supposed to
get done last night.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.369
Yeah, I know.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.338
Scotty...

10:06.406 --> 10:08.473
And to think I was
going to make pancakes.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.276
I could eat pancakes.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.411
I'm sure.

10:14.214 --> 10:17.449
Mom, we never have pancakes
on weekdays.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.485
Well, I'm...

10:20.554 --> 10:22.654
I'm a little nervous
for today.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.389
I thought I deserved a treat.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.757
Why are you nervous?

10:25.826 --> 10:29.394
Well, I have a new boss.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.895
Or an employee.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.330
He's like a...

10:32.399 --> 10:33.565
He's like an employee-boss.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.034
What's an employee-boss?

10:37.037 --> 10:39.604
To tell you the truth,
I don't know.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.173
Well, just try your best.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.110
That's what dad
would say, right?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.747
On an important day.

10:48.815 --> 10:54.219
Yeah, that is
what your dad would have said.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.621
Hey, um, speaking of
important days,

10:56.690 --> 10:58.101
I think you've got
a doctor's appointment

10:58.125 --> 10:59.924
next week, kiddo,
right?

10:59.993 --> 11:00.825
Yeah...

11:00.894 --> 11:03.762
It's going to go great,
I know it.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.934
Since I'm going
to the doctors,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.703
can I have

11:11.772 --> 11:12.871
a special treat, too?

11:14.441 --> 11:17.542
Sure, name it,
you can have whatever you want.

11:17.611 --> 11:19.577
Well...

11:19.646 --> 11:21.624
These pancakes would be better
with chocolate chips.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.382
Chocolate chips?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.917
Chocolate chips I can manage.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.085
Chocolate chips.

11:49.342 --> 11:50.742
Hi.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.310
You must be Nick Bowers.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.311
Yes.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.279
I'm Mia winters.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.980
Happy to see that
you're hear so early.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.089
We have a lot to do today.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.117
Great, well,

11:58.151 --> 12:00.185
just show me
to my office.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.597
I'll need copies
of all the financials

12:01.621 --> 12:02.554
for the last four years.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.823
No, make it five.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.291
Uh...

12:06.359 --> 12:08.093
Is there a problem?

12:08.161 --> 12:10.261
Kind of.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.164
I came here to
do you a favor, dad.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.299
It is not so much to ask

12:14.367 --> 12:15.778
that you learn about
the business in the flesh,

12:15.802 --> 12:16.901
and not just on the paper?

12:16.970 --> 12:20.505
We're not some
anonymous company, Nick!

12:20.574 --> 12:21.806
We are family!

12:25.479 --> 12:26.678
Um...

12:26.747 --> 12:28.813
Well, now, uh,
that's settled,

12:28.882 --> 12:29.882
um, Mia?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.316
Yes?

12:31.384 --> 12:33.151
Why don't you
show Nick around?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.220
Oh, sure.

12:37.324 --> 12:37.989
Hi.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.524
Hi.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.726
Shall we?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.828
Look... Mia, is it?

12:43.897 --> 12:44.897
Yes.

12:44.931 --> 12:45.764
Can we just get through
this absurdity

12:45.832 --> 12:46.965
as quickly as possible?

12:47.033 --> 12:48.399
I'm not here
to play shop clerk.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.268
I have a real job to do.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.271
Oh, so you think
I don't do a real job.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.272
No, no, that's not
what I meant.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.373
Because, you know,

12:55.442 --> 12:56.619
if I didn't show up
to open the store every day

12:56.643 --> 12:59.377
and sell Christmas hats,
and gift wrap, and ornaments,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.346
there wouldn't be any money
for you to count up

13:01.414 --> 13:03.254
and put on those spreadsheets
you like to make.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.984
Well, apparently,
there isn't.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.990
Okay, so,

13:12.058 --> 13:13.402
this is where
we keep all the inventory.

13:13.426 --> 13:13.992
Hey, Mia.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.326
Hey, Sam.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.861
Can the rumors be true?
Nick Bowers!

13:16.930 --> 13:18.663
Hey, man.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.167
Sam?

13:22.235 --> 13:23.067
Sam Jones?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.302
Yeah.
How are you?

13:24.371 --> 13:25.904
Mia, let me tell you,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.072
back in high school,
this guy was the man!

13:29.276 --> 13:30.375
I'm sure.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.010
Yeah, well...

13:32.078 --> 13:33.278
So, you stayed
in Wilsonville?

13:33.346 --> 13:34.245
Yeah.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.480
What have you
been up to?

13:35.549 --> 13:36.826
Well, you know,
I'm warehouse foreman now,

13:36.850 --> 13:37.882
which is nice.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.095
I got a promotion
a couple months ago.

13:39.119 --> 13:39.884
Great.

13:39.953 --> 13:40.752
More
importantly,

13:40.821 --> 13:42.287
you remember Katie Felder?

13:42.355 --> 13:43.755
Um...

13:43.824 --> 13:46.124
Doesn't matter,
she's Katie Jones now.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.559
Oh, she is.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.160
And they have three
of the cutest girls

13:49.229 --> 13:50.862
you've ever seen.

13:50.931 --> 13:51.796
Wow.

13:51.865 --> 13:52.530
Great for you.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.599
Yeah.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.167
Well, shall we?

13:56.236 --> 13:58.203
Uh, hey, we'd
love to have you

13:58.271 --> 13:59.304
over for dinner sometime.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.372
You know, we could

14:00.440 --> 14:02.774
throw the football around
for old times, huh?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.375
Uh, maybe.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.979
Actually, um,

14:08.048 --> 14:09.225
I don't know how long
I'm going to be in town.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.626
I'm kind of hoping
to wrap things up

14:10.650 --> 14:12.150
as quickly as possible

14:12.219 --> 14:13.219
and get back to New York.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.054
right. Sure, of course.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.322
I mean, hey,

14:17.390 --> 14:19.630
I mean, I bet New York's
a really exciting place to live.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.259
It is.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.997
Well, uh,

14:26.066 --> 14:27.498
Mia here was just
going to, um...

14:27.567 --> 14:29.601
Show me the ropes
around the store,

14:29.669 --> 14:31.002
and the warehouse.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.303
Great.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.238
Well, I won't keep you.

14:33.306 --> 14:34.472
It was good seeing you, Nick.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.708
Mia.

14:36.776 --> 14:37.776
See ya, Sam.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.784
First order of business,

14:46.853 --> 14:49.153
you need to choose a hat.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.121
Excuse me?

14:50.190 --> 14:51.322
Store policy.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.369
All the employees must wear
a Santa hat at all times

14:53.393 --> 14:54.659
in the store.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.628
Are they
still doing that?

14:56.696 --> 14:57.962
We're "hats off to Christmas."

14:58.031 --> 14:59.931
It's not that shocking
of a revelation.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.933
Besides, we have
a hundred different styles

15:02.002 --> 15:03.801
for you to choose from.

15:03.870 --> 15:04.914
I'm sure you can find
one in here

15:04.938 --> 15:06.170
that you wouldn't
mind wearing.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.172
Yeah, well, I don't think
a Santa hat

15:08.241 --> 15:09.340
goes with my outfit.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.611
Yeah, that's the other thing,

15:13.680 --> 15:14.846
you're way overdressed.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.147
You need to
look friendly

15:16.216 --> 15:17.416
and approachable to customers.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.717
You look like you came from
a GQ photo shoot.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.719
Should I take that
as a compliment?

15:29.763 --> 15:30.561
There.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.963
Very fetching.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.666
Let's get to work.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.506
Hey.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.507
Oh, you don't
have to do dinner.

15:42.575 --> 15:43.775
I'll put something
together.

15:43.843 --> 15:44.843
Are you sure?

15:44.911 --> 15:45.810
Yeah. Thank you, though.

15:45.879 --> 15:46.911
How was your day?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.880
Well, Nick started today,

15:48.949 --> 15:51.182
and there's good news
and bad news.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.517
The good news is,

15:52.585 --> 15:54.919
he doesn't want to be here
any more than I want him here.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.387
And the bad news?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.323
Bad news is
he doesn't leave tomorrow.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.326
Where's Scotty?

16:01.394 --> 16:02.293
He's in the living room,

16:02.362 --> 16:03.639
researching
Jack o' lantern designs

16:03.663 --> 16:04.696
for the annual

16:04.764 --> 16:05.964
pumpkin carving contest.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.465
I was so bad at that.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.534
Yeah.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.234
His dad always
did that with him.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.771
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.447
You took

16:22.515 --> 16:23.281
a two-hour lunch?

16:23.350 --> 16:24.415
I was lining up
my next gig

16:24.484 --> 16:25.416
in New York.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.595
I had some
phone calls to make

16:26.619 --> 16:28.353
before the day ended
over there.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.354
Well good, you can
make it up to me

16:29.422 --> 16:30.599
because I need
to leave early today.

16:30.623 --> 16:31.801
You trust me in here
all by myself?

16:31.825 --> 16:33.569
Considering your struggle
to remember rule number one,

16:33.593 --> 16:34.926
that's a valid question.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.062
Oh, I can ring you up.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.837
That will be
7.55, please.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.846
There you go.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.755
Thank you
for shopping with us.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.424
What?

17:06.492 --> 17:07.558
What did I do wrong?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.292
You could be...

17:09.362 --> 17:10.461
I don't know, friendlier.

17:11.897 --> 17:12.964
Never mind, forget it.

17:13.032 --> 17:13.964
I want to look at
these inventory sheets with you.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.701
They're in this folder.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.872
It's all pretty
basic stuff.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.441
The soft goods,
meaning, you know, hats,

17:23.510 --> 17:24.642
we manufacture here,

17:24.711 --> 17:26.188
and then we order
a number of wholesale items

17:26.212 --> 17:27.455
just to round out
all of our inventory.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.213
Have you ever considered
a website?

17:29.282 --> 17:30.348
Yeah, actually,

17:30.417 --> 17:31.482
but your father...

17:31.551 --> 17:32.884
Is a dinosaur.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.831
I guess there's probably
a nicer way of putting that.

17:35.855 --> 17:37.855
Look, Mia,

17:37.924 --> 17:40.091
you run this place
like a well-oiled machine.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.225
You know as well as I do

17:41.294 --> 17:43.594
that the brick-and-mortar
sales model is a relic.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.430
Listen, I agree with you, okay?

17:45.498 --> 17:46.697
But your dad prides himself

17:46.766 --> 17:48.900
on the face-to-face contact

17:48.968 --> 17:50.701
with all of
his customers.

17:50.770 --> 17:51.702
Good luck convincing him

17:51.771 --> 17:53.115
that he could still have
a small-town feel

17:53.139 --> 17:55.039
with a national website.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.585
He won't have a small-town feel
without a store either.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.076
What?

17:59.012 --> 17:59.877
Nothing.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.824
It's always Christmas
here at hats off to Christmas.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.592
Oh, jeez.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.828
Sure, I'll
head right over.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.098
I've got to
run over to the office.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.799
Take a look at these sheets

18:21.868 --> 18:24.135
and let me know
if you have any questions.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.369
Aye-aye, captain.

18:40.854 --> 18:42.954
It's always Christmas
at hats off to Christmas.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.322
Nick speaking.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.860
No, no, no,

18:48.928 --> 18:50.027
we were not told

18:50.096 --> 18:53.064
that another banker
had taken over our accounts.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.273
Oh, Mia, I just
wanted to check in.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.978
So, how are
things going

19:07.046 --> 19:08.046
with Nick?

19:08.081 --> 19:11.149
Well, he's smart and capable,

19:11.217 --> 19:12.316
and he's...

19:12.385 --> 19:15.119
Polite with the customers.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.621
We're making it work.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.122
I know he can be stubborn,

19:18.191 --> 19:19.524
but it's just always
been my dream

19:19.592 --> 19:21.526
that he'd take over
the company when I retire.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.049
Do you think
that's what he wants?

19:24.097 --> 19:25.329
Not yet.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.665
I know he's always wanted
everything bigger and better.

19:27.734 --> 19:31.302
The best university,
a big city, a fancy car.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.470
That's my Nick.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.172
But I just think

19:34.240 --> 19:35.551
that if he sees this place
from your perspective,

19:35.575 --> 19:37.742
and really learns it
from the inside-out,

19:37.810 --> 19:39.377
then maybe he'll realize

19:39.445 --> 19:41.012
that we can be
as viable a business

19:41.080 --> 19:43.548
as any of those big corporations
he usually works for.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.184
Well, I'm doing
everything I can.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.985
Oh, I know you will, Mia.

19:48.054 --> 19:48.753
Michael.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.587
Valerie fry
from the bank,

19:49.656 --> 19:51.889
line two.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.457
Oh.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.226
I'm going to just...

19:57.130 --> 19:57.995
Hello, Valerie.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.064
Yes.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.276
Where's Nick?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.143
I don't know.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.644
The store was empty
when I got here.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.513
You've got to be kidding me.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.681
And I'll leave you

20:16.749 --> 20:17.648
with that new bit
of aggravation.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.717
I gotta go.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.828
Bye, Scotty.
See you tomorrow.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.185
Bye, Ellie.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.254
See you.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.421
Hey, kiddo.

20:23.489 --> 20:25.523
What do you have
going on here?

20:25.592 --> 20:28.392
Oh... pumpkin
carving ideas.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.527
Yeah.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.562
I'm gonna make something
really cool this year.

20:31.631 --> 20:32.897
I bet you will.

20:32.966 --> 20:33.831
Thanks for helping
with that.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.566
No problem.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.237
You just decide to
leave the store unattended?

20:39.305 --> 20:40.605
Oh, no, no,
that's my fault.

20:40.673 --> 20:41.784
I needed a hand
with some heavy lifting.

20:41.808 --> 20:44.642
Hey, Scotty!

20:44.711 --> 20:45.788
Pumpkin carving
research, huh?

20:45.812 --> 20:47.011
Yeah.

20:47.080 --> 20:47.812
Yeah, that
time of year again.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.646
If you want to
talk pumpkins,

20:48.715 --> 20:49.947
you should talk
to this guy.

20:50.016 --> 20:52.550
He won that contest
three years running.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.451
Really?

20:53.519 --> 20:55.219
Nick, this is
my son, Scotty.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.487
Scotty, this is Nick.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.955
Your employee-boss?

21:01.361 --> 21:03.194
Um, you know, you have
a doctor's appointment.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.795
I don't want to be late.
Let's go.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.635
So, three years
in a row?

21:10.703 --> 21:13.404
Think maybe you can help me
with my pumpkin carving?

21:13.473 --> 21:14.939
Oh, honey,

21:15.008 --> 21:17.008
Nick is really busy.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.510
Uh... yeah.
That's true, I'm busy.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.046
But Sam said you were the best.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.548
I did say that.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.885
And mom is really bad at it.

21:27.954 --> 21:28.819
Hey...

21:28.888 --> 21:30.321
That's true.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.390
I am pretty
awful at it,

21:31.424 --> 21:33.190
but you don't have to do that.

21:33.259 --> 21:33.958
It's all right.

21:34.027 --> 21:35.793
I think I can, um,

21:35.862 --> 21:37.695
I find a little time
to carve some pumpkins.

21:37.764 --> 21:38.896
Awesome!

21:38.965 --> 21:39.965
Awesome.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.432
Great.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.845
Well, we've got to get
to that doctor's appointment,

21:42.869 --> 21:43.768
so let's go.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.169
All right.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.671
Halloween is next week, so...

21:46.739 --> 21:48.339
How about I see you
this weekend?

21:48.408 --> 21:49.473
Great!

21:49.542 --> 21:50.542
Great.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.343
Come on, mom.

21:52.412 --> 21:53.892
kid, I'll meet you
outside, all right?

21:59.018 --> 22:00.951
Look...

22:01.020 --> 22:03.721
Scotty isn't like
most nine-year-old little boys.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.589
Looks pretty normal to me.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.625
He just has a little
additional hardware.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.394
Yeah.

22:12.598 --> 22:13.664
Thanks.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.169
All right, kiddo.

22:18.237 --> 22:20.171
You ready?

22:26.012 --> 22:28.846
That's really nice
what you did, Nick.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.781
Oh, hey,
it's no big deal.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.650
It is to a single mom
and a widow.

22:32.719 --> 22:33.818
What?

22:33.886 --> 22:35.252
I gotta get
back to work.

22:44.630 --> 22:45.908
He doesn't seem to be
getting better.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.565
You know,
after the accident, everyone...

22:47.633 --> 22:50.134
Expected a full recovery?

22:50.203 --> 22:51.936
Yeah.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.044
Well, look,

22:53.106 --> 22:54.249
I'm sure you've heard
this all before,

22:54.273 --> 22:57.708
but in what we call
a "complete" spinal injury,

22:57.777 --> 23:00.311
all function
below the injured area is lost.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.213
Now, in an "incomplete"
spinal injury,

23:02.281 --> 23:03.547
some or all function

23:03.616 --> 23:04.949
may be unaffected.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.886
Now, Scotty's injuries
appears to be incomplete.

23:10.656 --> 23:11.934
The inflammation
in his vertebrae

23:11.958 --> 23:12.958
is all but healed,

23:12.992 --> 23:16.127
and he has sensory function
in his legs.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.497
We have every reason to believe
that motor function will follow.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.565
Well, it's been 18 months.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.467
You've taken him
to physical therapy.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.902
How has he responded to that?

23:24.971 --> 23:27.405
He was miserable.

23:27.473 --> 23:30.307
He says he can get used to
life in the chair,

23:30.376 --> 23:31.809
but, at the same time,

23:31.878 --> 23:33.188
he's tired
of feeling like a failure

23:33.212 --> 23:35.045
because he's not walking again.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.191
The process
can be overwhelming

23:36.215 --> 23:37.581
even for adults.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.950
Yeah, and I...

23:40.019 --> 23:42.653
And I just can't promise him
that it's going to get better.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.388
With school,
I can tell him, you know,

23:44.457 --> 23:45.589
"study for this test"

23:45.658 --> 23:46.902
and his grades
will reflect that effort,

23:46.926 --> 23:48.259
but with this...

23:48.327 --> 23:50.161
Yeah.

23:50.229 --> 23:53.998
Look, I know, Mia, but...

23:54.066 --> 23:55.533
Looking at his medical history,

23:55.601 --> 23:57.301
it's entirely possible

23:57.370 --> 24:00.070
that Scotty's most
debilitating injuries

24:00.139 --> 24:02.206
aren't physical, but emotional.

24:03.476 --> 24:04.608
I mean,
he didn't just lose

24:04.677 --> 24:06.544
his ability to walk
in that accident.

24:06.612 --> 24:07.956
He lost his father, too,
didn't he?

24:07.980 --> 24:09.880
Yeah.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.682
My advice,
as Scotty's doctor...

24:13.085 --> 24:16.253
Would be to just
take it easy right now.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.521
Take the pressure off him.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.623
Just... focus on having fun...

24:19.692 --> 24:20.724
Together.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.394
We can do that.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.335
Hey.

24:31.404 --> 24:32.603
What's happening here?

24:32.672 --> 24:35.873
I'm on time,
I'm wearing my Santa hat,

24:35.942 --> 24:36.942
and I'm doing my job.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.375
I know.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.777
This makes no sense.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.815
So, do you want to
explain to me

24:44.884 --> 24:46.283
why you've taken
all the red hats

24:46.352 --> 24:47.751
off the shelves?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.687
Yeah, sure.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.055
I'm moving them
to the back.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.756
That's our number one
selling hat.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.859
People come to this store
just for that.

24:54.927 --> 24:56.861
Exactly.
Think about it.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.662
Grocery stores,

24:58.731 --> 24:59.663
they make you
walk a mile

24:59.732 --> 25:00.742
to get to the milk
or the eggs.

25:00.766 --> 25:02.099
You have to walk past

25:02.168 --> 25:04.335
the $5.00 boxes of cereal
and the ice cream

25:04.403 --> 25:05.414
in hopes that
some of those items

25:05.438 --> 25:06.737
may fall into your basket.

25:06.806 --> 25:08.038
Well, the same
thing here.

25:08.107 --> 25:11.141
You see, we have to
show the customers

25:11.210 --> 25:12.776
all of the inventory

25:12.845 --> 25:15.346
as they make their way
to the red hats,

25:15.414 --> 25:17.248
because if you get them
by the door,

25:17.316 --> 25:20.150
well then, you've only
sold one hat.

25:20.219 --> 25:21.752
But what you want

25:21.821 --> 25:23.131
is for the lady that comes in
to buy the hat

25:23.155 --> 25:26.690
with her husband's
favorite team logo on it,

25:26.759 --> 25:27.870
or the purple hat with sequins

25:27.894 --> 25:30.661
that her teenaged daughter
will love.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.829
Exactly.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.864
And then you've sold
three hats instead of one.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.599
Nick Bowers,

25:35.668 --> 25:37.968
you're absolutely right.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.037
Let's do it.

25:39.071 --> 25:40.938
Great.

25:42.108 --> 25:42.973
Take these to the back.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.208
Okay...

25:55.187 --> 25:56.954
Oh, you know what?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.122
You've been on such a roll,

25:58.190 --> 26:00.157
why don't you go
handle this customer?

26:03.663 --> 26:04.828
Hello there,

26:04.897 --> 26:07.631
welcome to
hats off to Christmas...

26:08.901 --> 26:09.901
Valerie?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.168
Valerie fry?

26:11.237 --> 26:12.369
Nick!

26:12.438 --> 26:13.904
Nick...

26:13.973 --> 26:15.317
Your dad told me
you were working here,

26:15.341 --> 26:16.607
but I didn't believe it

26:16.676 --> 26:18.242
until I could see it
with my own eyes.

26:18.311 --> 26:19.610
Wow, you look amazing.

26:19.679 --> 26:20.679
Well, thank you.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.081
What are you
doing here?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.849
I'm your relationship
manager.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.351
Do I need one of those?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.285
I'm actually single.

26:29.789 --> 26:30.988
I'm a banker.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.834
And when my boss found out
that I grew up around here,

26:32.858 --> 26:34.858
he agreed to let me
take on your account.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.894
I didn't know
a meeting was set.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.563
Uh, yeah, the hats off loan

26:39.632 --> 26:40.876
is up for review
at the end of the year,

26:40.900 --> 26:44.168
and, well, the way
things have been going

26:44.236 --> 26:45.402
the last couple of years...

26:45.471 --> 26:46.537
I know,

26:46.606 --> 26:48.272
and that's
why I'm here.

26:48.341 --> 26:49.673
You said
"up for review?"

26:49.742 --> 26:51.275
Is this an audit?

26:51.344 --> 26:52.554
Are you planning on pulling
my dad's line of credit?

26:52.578 --> 26:55.446
Well, we hope
it doesn't get that far.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.815
I'm on your side, Nick.

26:57.883 --> 26:58.961
I know how important
this place is

26:58.985 --> 26:59.783
to the whole town.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.652
And...

27:01.721 --> 27:03.854
If anyone can help
turn this place around,

27:03.923 --> 27:05.856
it's you.

27:07.927 --> 27:10.060
Well, I, um...

27:10.129 --> 27:11.362
Have been a little waylaid

27:11.430 --> 27:12.674
trying to learn this place
from the ground up.

27:13.699 --> 27:14.898
Come on in.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.767
Oh, this is Mia winters.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.502
Mia, this is Valerie fry.

27:18.571 --> 27:19.470
We were...

27:19.538 --> 27:21.472
Friends in high school.

27:21.540 --> 27:23.173
I'd say we were
a little more

27:23.242 --> 27:24.242
than friends.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.412
It's nice to meet you.

27:28.481 --> 27:29.813
Hmm?

27:29.882 --> 27:30.948
Oh.

27:31.017 --> 27:32.282
Yes, you too.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.753
Uh, Nick, I have
a meeting with your father

27:35.821 --> 27:37.099
and I assume once you're done
unpacking hats

27:37.123 --> 27:38.200
and get back into the books,

27:38.224 --> 27:39.801
we'll be spending
a lot more time together.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.058
Yeah.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.429
Oh, Nick?

27:45.498 --> 27:46.864
I'm glad to hear
you're single.

27:50.569 --> 27:52.369
Yeah.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.276
Hey, um...

27:59.345 --> 28:01.979
What's next, boss?

28:02.048 --> 28:04.715
You know, I think
we're probably done here.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.016
Are you sure?
I don't mind.

28:06.085 --> 28:09.687
Yeah, no, your dad wanted you
to experience the store,

28:09.755 --> 28:12.156
and you did, so...

28:12.224 --> 28:13.791
You should probably get back

28:13.859 --> 28:15.859
to the work that you came here
to do anyway, right?

28:15.928 --> 28:17.061
Okay.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.473
Video games upstairs?

28:31.043 --> 28:32.376
Uh... yeah,
I said he could play

28:32.445 --> 28:33.944
if he finished his homework.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.246
Which he has not
been doing at all recently.

28:36.315 --> 28:37.948
Sorry.

28:39.919 --> 28:40.718
What did Nick do today?

28:40.786 --> 28:42.720
Nothing.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.523
Nothing.
Actually, no, not nothing.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.492
He reorganized the floor design

28:48.561 --> 28:50.038
and he actually had
some pretty good ideas.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.062
So, what, you actually
like working with him, then?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.765
I didn't say that.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.100
But it doesn't matter anyway.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.434
I relieved him

28:57.503 --> 28:59.536
of his Santa hat
duties today.

28:59.605 --> 29:01.550
You know, he didn't come here
to work in the store.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.474
He came here to pick up

29:03.542 --> 29:05.175
where the retired
CFO left off.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.911
Plus, I know he's dying
to get back to New York,

29:07.980 --> 29:10.280
and I'm not going to
stand in his way, so...

29:10.349 --> 29:11.915
I can't wait
to see it.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.152
I'm sure it's
going to be great.

29:16.255 --> 29:17.554
I'll get it.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.689
Thank you.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.365
Hey, Nick.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.500
Hey, buddy.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.213
You ready to carve
an award-winning pumpkin?

29:31.237 --> 29:32.102
Totally.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.337
Great.

29:35.541 --> 29:36.607
Hey.

29:36.675 --> 29:37.608
Hey, Mia.

29:37.676 --> 29:38.575
Are you going to help us?

29:38.644 --> 29:40.344
Oh, no, no, no.

29:40.412 --> 29:41.445
She's really bad at it.

29:41.514 --> 29:42.846
Scotty!

29:42.915 --> 29:44.281
Geez...

29:44.350 --> 29:45.716
No, I'm good at other things,

29:45.785 --> 29:47.117
like making cookies,

29:47.186 --> 29:48.118
which you won't be
getting any of

29:48.187 --> 29:49.820
if you keep picking on
your poor old mom.

29:49.889 --> 29:50.921
Sorry.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.656
What's this about cookies?

29:52.725 --> 29:53.902
Get your finger
out of the bowl.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.058
What are you doing?

29:55.127 --> 29:55.926
Mm, you know, you're right,
you are good at that.

29:57.396 --> 29:59.897
Scotty, leave her alone,
she's baking.

30:00.733 --> 30:01.865
So I put a tarp out there

30:01.934 --> 30:03.545
and all the tools you guys
are going to need.

30:03.569 --> 30:04.668
Great.

30:04.737 --> 30:05.602
Have fun.

30:05.671 --> 30:06.671
You got that?

30:06.705 --> 30:07.538
It's heavy.

30:07.606 --> 30:08.405
This way.

30:08.474 --> 30:09.273
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.140
Bye, guys.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.009
See ya.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.018
Wow, you guys
are already done?

30:21.086 --> 30:21.952
I was about to
bring you a snack.

30:22.021 --> 30:23.053
It looks great, mom.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.855
Well, I can't wait to see it.

30:24.924 --> 30:25.924
No!

30:25.958 --> 30:26.757
Not until the contest.

30:26.826 --> 30:27.991
We want it to be a surprise.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.561
Okay.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.073
Also, it's not time
to see the pumpkin.

30:32.097 --> 30:33.564
It's cookie-eating time.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.699
Serious?

30:35.768 --> 30:37.245
What, they're
Christmas cookie cutters

30:37.269 --> 30:38.202
from the shop.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.270
Mm...

30:39.338 --> 30:40.637
And you guys
are getting pumpkin

30:40.706 --> 30:41.706
all over my floor!

30:41.740 --> 30:42.840
Oh, sorry.

30:52.117 --> 30:55.118
You want to
throw that in the wash?

30:55.187 --> 30:56.231
Oh, no, that's
fine, thanks.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.788
I'm putting a load
of laundry in now.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.323
It's not a problem.

30:59.391 --> 31:00.891
All right, thanks.

31:03.762 --> 31:06.630
So, are you going to be
coming to the contest?

31:06.699 --> 31:07.731
Sure, bud,
when is it?

31:07.800 --> 31:10.334
After school,
the day before Halloween.

31:11.637 --> 31:12.803
I think I can make that work.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.138
So, tell me,

31:15.207 --> 31:16.740
what kind of stuff
do you like to do?

31:16.809 --> 31:17.941
I like video games,

31:18.010 --> 31:18.909
movies,

31:18.978 --> 31:20.143
making model airplanes.

31:20.212 --> 31:24.414
I used to like sports a lot,
football mostly.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.428
Hey, I was the quarterback
on my high school team.

31:26.452 --> 31:29.853
We should throw the ball
around sometime.

31:30.856 --> 31:31.688
What?

31:31.757 --> 31:33.223
You only like
watching football?

31:35.628 --> 31:37.494
Nick...

31:37.563 --> 31:39.696
I know, but...

31:39.765 --> 31:40.864
Well, your arms
work, right?

31:40.933 --> 31:42.699
You only need
your arms

31:42.768 --> 31:43.879
to throw the ball
and to catch,

31:43.903 --> 31:46.203
which is about
half of football,

31:46.272 --> 31:47.437
and you also need your arms

31:47.506 --> 31:49.273
to reach
for cookies.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.413
I think you can toss
the ball around.

31:56.482 --> 31:57.848
Cheers.

32:08.727 --> 32:09.760
So, buddy,

32:09.828 --> 32:11.039
you know by keeping this
covered up,

32:11.063 --> 32:13.797
it makes it a lot harder
on me to move around, right?

32:13.866 --> 32:15.543
Mom, I want you to see it
at the big reveal

32:15.567 --> 32:16.600
with everyone else.

32:16.669 --> 32:17.768
Please?

32:17.836 --> 32:18.869
Okay, fine.

32:18.938 --> 32:20.504
But only because I love you

32:20.572 --> 32:22.706
more than anything
in the whole world.

32:22.775 --> 32:23.674
Please don't say that

32:23.742 --> 32:25.509
in front of everyone
at the contest.

32:25.577 --> 32:27.010
It would be so embarrassing.

32:27.079 --> 32:28.612
Okay, deal.

32:28.681 --> 32:34.818
Let me get that.

32:34.887 --> 32:35.964
We're here.
Are you excited?

32:35.988 --> 32:37.421
Yeah. Do you think
Nick is here yet?

32:37.489 --> 32:39.356
Let's go see.

32:48.934 --> 32:50.100
All right, kiddo,

32:50.169 --> 32:51.368
your pumpkin
is out there,

32:51.437 --> 32:52.647
and the judging's
about to start.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.237
Mom, did you...

32:54.306 --> 32:55.605
I didn't look, I swear.

32:55.674 --> 32:56.840
I made it!

32:56.909 --> 32:58.308
Oh, look who's here.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.242
Yeah.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.043
I can't wait to see
your creation.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.112
Thanks for coming, Ellie.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.313
Now all we have to do
is wait for Nick.

33:04.616 --> 33:08.251
Yeah. He should
be here any minute.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.566
Can you pass me
the quarterly reports

33:15.627 --> 33:17.661
for last year?

33:24.370 --> 33:25.469
val, listen,

33:25.537 --> 33:27.871
if your bank doesn't
renew our loan,

33:27.940 --> 33:29.106
you're going to put

33:29.174 --> 33:30.418
all these people
we grew up with out of work.

33:30.442 --> 33:33.343
I'm not here
to give charity, Nick.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.078
I have a job to do.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.513
I mean, you know.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.283
You dismantle companies,
sell them,

33:40.352 --> 33:43.186
whatever makes the most
financial sense.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.321
Yeah...

33:44.390 --> 33:45.322
I just can't believe

33:45.391 --> 33:48.258
my dad let this
go on this long.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.960
I mean, another
few years of this,

33:50.029 --> 33:51.573
and George would've run
this whole business

33:51.597 --> 33:52.929
into the ground.

33:52.998 --> 33:54.531
Most small-town
businesses

33:54.600 --> 33:55.777
are more interested in
making friends

33:55.801 --> 33:56.533
than making money.

33:56.602 --> 33:57.934
And without shareholders,

33:58.003 --> 34:00.337
there's no accountability
for management.

34:00.406 --> 34:04.241
Not exactly
a fortune 500 mentality.

34:04.309 --> 34:05.829
Aren't you so glad
you got out of here?

34:07.179 --> 34:09.346
Yeah, I think so.

34:10.616 --> 34:13.483
You "think" so?

34:13.552 --> 34:14.552
You know,

34:14.620 --> 34:16.152
being back

34:16.221 --> 34:18.166
really hasn't been as bad
as I thought it would be.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.223
Oh, come on.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.925
I know what you do for a living.

34:22.995 --> 34:25.629
This must be
child's play to you.

34:25.697 --> 34:28.098
Aren't you so bored?

34:34.606 --> 34:38.141
Uh... kiddo,

34:38.210 --> 34:40.243
look, I've called him
a bunch of times.

34:40.312 --> 34:41.623
I'm sure there's
a really good reason

34:41.647 --> 34:43.447
as to why
he's not here.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.116
Yeah, he's probably
stuck at work.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.951
They're about to
announce the winners.

34:48.020 --> 34:50.420
Come on, let's go get
a good view up front.

34:50.489 --> 34:51.788
Welcome, everyone.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.724
Welcome to the 39th annual

34:54.793 --> 34:57.928
Wilsonville
pumpkin carving contest.

34:57.996 --> 35:01.198
After much deliberation,

35:01.266 --> 35:03.500
we are finally ready
to announce the winners.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.870
Oh, thank you all
for these wonderful entries.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.840
And now
to announce our winners.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.375
We have five honorable mentions,

35:12.444 --> 35:13.810
and they will have
certificates

35:13.879 --> 35:15.579
placed by their pumpkins.

35:15.647 --> 35:18.949
As for the top three entries,

35:19.017 --> 35:21.551
here we go...

35:21.620 --> 35:22.986
In third place is...

35:23.055 --> 35:24.055
Seth Norton!

35:24.089 --> 35:27.791
With his haunted
graveyard pumpkin!

35:30.829 --> 35:33.797
In second place is...

35:33.866 --> 35:34.866
Dee Henstrum,

35:34.900 --> 35:38.468
with her witch pumpkin!

35:41.440 --> 35:42.906
And...

35:42.975 --> 35:46.476
The grand prize winner is...

35:46.545 --> 35:48.778
Scotty winters

35:48.847 --> 35:51.081
with his Santa hat pumpkin!

35:56.188 --> 35:58.088
That is the most
beautiful pumpkin

35:58.157 --> 35:59.055
I have ever seen.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.124
Yeah...

36:02.794 --> 36:05.695
This was such
a good surprise, thank you..

36:07.232 --> 36:09.866
Oh, Scotty,
I gotta go, okay?

36:09.935 --> 36:11.146
But I'm so glad
I got to see your pumpkin.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.536
It's awesome.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.671
You're part of Wilsonville
history now, you know.

36:14.740 --> 36:15.917
All right, so I will
see you tomorrow

36:15.941 --> 36:16.973
after school.

36:17.042 --> 36:18.562
And I will see you
tomorrow after work.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.876
Okay, bye, guys.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.112
Come on up, winners.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.513
Come up and get your ribbons.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.388
Scotty, congratulations.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.224
Well done.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.532
We need a break.

36:42.601 --> 36:45.168
Drinks? Dinner?

36:45.237 --> 36:48.371
I think it's about time
you and I finally caught up.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.440
All we've talked about

36:49.474 --> 36:50.207
is this company's
financial statements.

36:50.275 --> 36:51.775
I know, val,

36:51.843 --> 36:52.742
but I can't, not today.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.251
I've got this thing
this afternoon...

36:55.814 --> 36:57.013
Oh, no. Oh...

36:57.082 --> 36:58.248
What?

36:58.317 --> 36:58.982
Oh, no.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.250
She's going to...

37:01.787 --> 37:03.053
She's going to hate me.

37:03.121 --> 37:04.121
Who is?

37:06.425 --> 37:07.724
I'll see you tomorrow,
okay, val?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.993
I'm sorry.

37:15.601 --> 37:17.701
Kiddo, I really
don't think he's coming.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.669
I'm going to go
tell her by, okay?

37:23.108 --> 37:24.108
He's here!

37:25.811 --> 37:28.011
Scotty...

37:28.747 --> 37:30.013
bud, you won!

37:30.082 --> 37:31.181
Congratulations!

37:33.185 --> 37:34.117
We won.

37:34.186 --> 37:35.496
Hey, I just supervised.
It was all you.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.054
But it was your idea
to use the light-up Santa hat.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.590
Yeah, that was my idea.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.294
Hey, I've got
a big favor to ask you.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.563
Do you think
you would be able to lend

37:46.632 --> 37:48.598
that award-winning pumpkin
to the store?

37:48.667 --> 37:51.201
Okay. Why?

37:51.270 --> 37:52.910
Because every time
I won this competition,

37:52.971 --> 37:55.071
my dad put the pumpkin
in the store window,

37:55.140 --> 37:57.020
and now it's time for
your award-winning pumpkin

37:57.075 --> 37:57.974
to take its
rightful place.

37:58.043 --> 37:58.908
What do you say?

37:58.977 --> 38:01.144
Awesome. Sure.

38:01.213 --> 38:02.846
Great.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.559
I'm going to talk to your
mom for a sec, all right?

38:04.583 --> 38:05.615
Okay.

38:09.721 --> 38:10.820
Sorry.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.455
Just don't...

38:12.524 --> 38:14.557
No, I was knee deep
in quarterly reports,

38:14.626 --> 38:15.759
and invoices,

38:15.827 --> 38:16.693
and I just
lost track of time.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.261
- I wanted to be here...
- Okay, why?

38:18.330 --> 38:19.929
What? What do you mean?

38:19.998 --> 38:21.898
Why do you want to
be here for Scotty?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.466
I know why
I want to be here for him,

38:23.535 --> 38:25.235
I'm his mother,

38:25.304 --> 38:26.870
and from the minute
that he was born,

38:26.938 --> 38:28.672
all I cared about
in this world

38:28.740 --> 38:29.339
was his happiness.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.041
And tomorrow,

38:31.109 --> 38:33.209
and next week,
and next month,

38:33.278 --> 38:34.744
it's me
that's going to

38:34.813 --> 38:36.146
continue to care,

38:36.214 --> 38:38.748
but you're not even
going to be here.

38:38.817 --> 38:39.749
Why are you
bothering now?

38:39.818 --> 38:40.517
Mia, I was just...

38:40.585 --> 38:42.719
No, that little boy

38:42.788 --> 38:44.487
has suffered more loss
in his nine years

38:44.556 --> 38:46.523
than most people do

38:46.591 --> 38:48.625
in their entire life.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.238
He doesn't need
to get attached to someone

38:50.262 --> 38:52.395
that's going to let him down.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.668
You're right.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.104
Believe me, I...

39:01.173 --> 39:02.772
I never meant
to hurt him.

39:05.811 --> 39:06.811
I know.

39:07.713 --> 39:09.112
It's really not your fault.

39:09.181 --> 39:10.280
It's not?

39:10.349 --> 39:13.550
You're not a small-town,

39:13.618 --> 39:18.822
pumpkin-carving contest
type of guy anymore.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.425
From what I've heard,
you never really were.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.027
You're here to do a job,

39:24.096 --> 39:25.895
then you're going
back to New York.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.898
Just...

39:28.967 --> 39:33.470
Leave us with our little
Wilsonville life, okay?

39:38.677 --> 39:41.044
All right, kiddo,
we have to get home.

39:41.113 --> 39:41.978
Say goodbye.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.179
Bye, Nick!

39:43.248 --> 39:44.692
Maybe we could throw around
the football next week?

39:44.716 --> 39:45.782
Yeah.

39:45.851 --> 39:46.851
See you, Scotty.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.038
Hey, so, um, can I borrow
your car today?

39:57.062 --> 39:58.339
I had to bring mine
into the shop.

39:58.363 --> 39:59.295
Oh, yeah, of course.

39:59.364 --> 40:00.964
I'll pick you up
after work.

40:01.032 --> 40:01.931
Okay, perfect. Here.

40:02.000 --> 40:02.932
Thank you.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.434
So...

40:04.503 --> 40:05.368
So?

40:05.437 --> 40:07.303
So, you haven't
mentioned Nick

40:07.372 --> 40:09.172
since the pumpkin-carving
contest.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.985
Hey, I have been trying
to give you your space,

40:11.009 --> 40:12.375
but enough is
enough already.

40:12.444 --> 40:13.444
What's the deal?

40:13.478 --> 40:15.211
There's no deal, El.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.814
What, so, it's not
awkward, then?

40:17.883 --> 40:19.182
I mean,
you yelled at him.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.885
Okay, first of all,
I did not yell at him,

40:21.953 --> 40:23.820
and, no, it's not
awkward at all.

40:23.889 --> 40:24.821
Plus, he spends
most of his time

40:24.890 --> 40:26.389
in the conference room.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.525
I barely see him.

40:28.593 --> 40:30.260
So you don't
miss him at all, then?

40:30.328 --> 40:31.227
Do I miss him?

40:31.296 --> 40:33.430
Ellie,
what are you talking about?

40:33.498 --> 40:34.431
Mia, I'm just saying,

40:34.499 --> 40:35.398
that you only get
really angry with someone

40:35.467 --> 40:36.366
if you're
disappointed with them,

40:36.435 --> 40:37.367
and that only happens

40:37.436 --> 40:38.613
if you liked them
in the first place,

40:38.637 --> 40:39.669
and had expectations

40:39.738 --> 40:41.070
that they didn't meet.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.505
Okay, have you been studying

40:42.574 --> 40:44.018
for your psychology degree
in your spare time?

40:44.042 --> 40:46.176
Please, Ellie.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.077
I had no expectations
of Nick Bowers,

40:48.146 --> 40:50.246
except for that he was
going to be stuck-up

40:50.315 --> 40:52.148
and self-centered
and a pain in the butt,

40:52.217 --> 40:53.316
which he was.

40:53.385 --> 40:55.852
You know,
and it's great,

40:55.921 --> 40:58.655
because now I don't have to
manage the store and Nick,

40:58.723 --> 41:01.391
and he gets to do
the work that he really likes,

41:01.460 --> 41:03.693
and, pretty soon,
he's going to leave town,

41:03.762 --> 41:05.039
and this'll all
going to be over.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.297
Okay.

41:11.403 --> 41:13.470
I'll see you after work.

41:32.157 --> 41:33.723
Oh, hey, dad.

41:33.792 --> 41:36.459
You look like you need
to get out of here.

41:36.528 --> 41:37.794
Get up and move around
a little.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.529
I just got in 20 minutes ago.

41:39.598 --> 41:42.265
Yes, but you've been sitting
in this room for a month.

41:45.237 --> 41:46.237
Yeah, you're right.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.139
I guess I could use a break.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.248
What did you have in mind?

41:51.309 --> 41:54.110
Actually, I could use
your help with something.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.879
Dad...

41:55.947 --> 41:57.780
Joann!

41:57.849 --> 41:58.893
Call down to the warehouse,

41:58.917 --> 42:01.017
get the guys to
bring that thing up.

42:01.086 --> 42:02.018
Sure thing.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.586
Dad, what
are we doing?

42:03.655 --> 42:04.787
You'll see.

42:10.762 --> 42:11.762
Good morning, Mia!

42:11.830 --> 42:14.797
Good morning, Mr. Bowers.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.032
Nick.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.400
Well, black Friday is looming,

42:17.469 --> 42:19.435
and we don't have
our window ready.

42:19.504 --> 42:20.403
Yes, I'm sorry,

42:20.472 --> 42:22.105
I've been so focused
on those invoices.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.273
I can see that,

42:23.341 --> 42:24.374
so to help you out,

42:24.442 --> 42:26.282
I took it upon myself
to create a little design

42:26.344 --> 42:29.212
for you two to execute.

42:29.281 --> 42:30.291
Dad, I really have
other things

42:30.315 --> 42:31.814
I need to get done.

42:33.285 --> 42:33.950
Mrs. Claus...

42:35.120 --> 42:36.753
...at the north pole,

42:36.821 --> 42:38.621
outside at a clothesline,

42:38.690 --> 42:40.423
drying our hats.

42:40.492 --> 42:41.991
The wind is blowing...

42:43.461 --> 42:44.327
We'll use a fan.

42:44.396 --> 42:47.163
A little fake snow
in the air.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.531
Hats from one end
to the other,

42:48.600 --> 42:51.768
clothes-pinned to the line.

42:51.836 --> 42:55.638
We can display
half of the inventory!

42:55.707 --> 42:57.240
Sounds wonderful, Mr. Bowers,

42:57.309 --> 42:59.742
but what do you want me to use
as Mrs. Claus?

42:59.811 --> 43:02.011
Ah, here comes

43:02.080 --> 43:03.346
the fine lady
herself.

43:05.016 --> 43:05.715
I had her ordered.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.183
Well, thank you, Dan.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.952
You can set her down
right there.

43:12.424 --> 43:13.523
Okay, you two,

43:13.592 --> 43:14.592
I want to see

43:14.626 --> 43:16.659
the most impressive
Christmas window

43:16.728 --> 43:17.927
in the history
of the store,

43:17.996 --> 43:20.096
so get cracking!

43:20.165 --> 43:21.764
Mr. Bowers,

43:21.833 --> 43:22.977
I am more than capable
of doing this myself...

43:23.001 --> 43:24.478
Dad, I thought I was done
working in the store...

43:24.502 --> 43:26.369
It's a big idea, Mia,

43:26.438 --> 43:27.904
and this Mrs. Claus

43:27.973 --> 43:30.206
isn't stuffed with
Styrofoam peanuts.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.874
She's heavy
and you'll need some help.

43:31.943 --> 43:32.742
And Nick,

43:32.811 --> 43:33.977
you need to do something

43:34.045 --> 43:35.189
that doesn't involve
a spreadsheet

43:35.213 --> 43:36.112
for a couple
of hours.

43:36.181 --> 43:37.181
may as well be this.

43:38.316 --> 43:39.215
Mr. Bowers...

43:39.284 --> 43:40.016
Dad...

43:40.085 --> 43:41.551
Have fun!

43:54.199 --> 43:55.365
Let's just
get this over with.

43:56.501 --> 43:58.201
Sure.

44:04.943 --> 44:06.009
All right.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.478
Just brace it with this...

44:12.017 --> 44:13.182
There you go.

44:13.251 --> 44:15.885
And it's going to
be strong enough?

44:15.954 --> 44:17.887
It's only got to
hold up a few hats.

44:17.956 --> 44:19.222
All right.

44:20.091 --> 44:22.659
Okay...

44:22.727 --> 44:24.494
This is done.

44:24.562 --> 44:26.763
Do you want to bring
Mrs. Claus over?

44:26.831 --> 44:28.031
Sure.

44:30.935 --> 44:32.669
What?

44:32.737 --> 44:33.803
Nothing.

44:33.872 --> 44:36.205
I love how I came here
to use my MBA

44:36.274 --> 44:37.652
and all I've been doing
is manual labor.

44:37.676 --> 44:39.676
Isn't that why your dad
wanted you to come here?

44:39.744 --> 44:41.944
I don't know why
my dad asked me to come here.

44:45.483 --> 44:48.418
Mrs. Claus,
I don't mean to be rude,

44:48.486 --> 44:49.764
but how many
of your husband's cookies

44:49.788 --> 44:50.853
have you been eating?

45:24.222 --> 45:25.955
Well, I hate to say it,

45:26.024 --> 45:28.257
but I think this might be
your father's best idea.

45:28.326 --> 45:31.694
Yeah, my dad does have
some pretty great ideas.

45:31.763 --> 45:32.628
Batter watch out,

45:32.697 --> 45:33.596
or he's going to
put you in charge of

45:33.665 --> 45:34.709
planning
the Christmas party.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.177
You know that's when
he really outdoes himself.

45:36.201 --> 45:37.066
Bring it on.

45:37.135 --> 45:38.634
Going to move this up...

45:38.703 --> 45:39.703
Whoa, whoa!

45:48.279 --> 45:51.013
Are you okay?

45:54.753 --> 45:56.052
I'm so sorry.

45:56.121 --> 45:57.520
I've destroyed
everything.

45:57.589 --> 45:59.222
Let's just
fix it tomorrow.

45:59.290 --> 46:00.757
I, uh...

46:00.825 --> 46:01.825
I know it's
getting late,

46:01.860 --> 46:02.725
and you probably have to
get home to Scotty.

46:02.794 --> 46:04.660
Actually Scotty's
at Jonah's house.

46:04.729 --> 46:06.295
He's working on
a science project.

46:06.364 --> 46:07.997
Oh, okay.

46:08.066 --> 46:09.232
Well, can I...

46:09.300 --> 46:10.500
Invite you to dinner?

46:12.504 --> 46:13.436
I don't know...

46:13.505 --> 46:14.937
Come on, Mia,

46:15.006 --> 46:16.706
I'm not such a bad guy.

46:29.454 --> 46:30.454
Hey, you two.

46:31.289 --> 46:32.989
Hi, Sam.

46:33.057 --> 46:34.290
How are you?

46:34.359 --> 46:35.124
I'm good, thanks.

46:35.193 --> 46:36.025
Do you want to
join us?

46:36.094 --> 46:37.627
Oh, you know,
I'd love to.

46:37.695 --> 46:39.762
I just wanted to
come say hi.

46:39.831 --> 46:40.831
I'm with
the girls, so...

46:43.601 --> 46:44.667
Beautiful kids, Sam.

46:44.736 --> 46:45.802
Thanks, man.

46:45.870 --> 46:46.803
So, is Katie here?

46:46.871 --> 46:47.770
Uh, no.

46:47.839 --> 46:48.839
She's, uh,

46:48.907 --> 46:50.640
she's home tonight.

46:50.708 --> 46:52.675
It's kind of a daddy-daughter
triple date thing.

46:52.744 --> 46:54.010
Great.

46:54.078 --> 46:55.578
Do you have
any recommendations?

46:55.647 --> 46:57.447
Not unless you want to eat
off the kids' menu.

46:57.482 --> 46:58.414
Daddy!

46:58.483 --> 46:59.816
All right!

46:59.884 --> 47:00.783
You guys enjoy
your food.

47:00.852 --> 47:01.852
See ya.

47:06.624 --> 47:08.090
Wow.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.492
Sam seems really happy.

47:09.561 --> 47:12.495
Well, yeah, but, you know...

47:12.564 --> 47:13.429
What?

47:13.498 --> 47:14.864
Oh, you don't know.

47:16.367 --> 47:19.435
Um, Katie's pregnant
with their fourth.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.137
They've been trying
for a boy,

47:21.206 --> 47:23.439
but she's had a lot of
complications with this one,

47:23.508 --> 47:25.575
and she's actually
been on bed rest

47:25.643 --> 47:27.276
since her second
trimester.

47:27.345 --> 47:30.079
She had to take
unpaid leave from her job.

47:30.148 --> 47:31.781
You know...

47:31.850 --> 47:34.383
I'm sure everything's
going to be fine, but...

47:34.452 --> 47:36.986
They're struggling
a little right now.

47:38.223 --> 47:39.689
I had no idea.

47:54.472 --> 47:57.340
So, how's Scotty been doing
after the loss of his dad?

47:57.408 --> 47:59.008
He's...

47:59.077 --> 48:01.210
He's been doing okay.

48:01.279 --> 48:03.412
You know, it's been 18 months.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.715
Scotty's such a good kid.

48:05.783 --> 48:07.950
Yeah, he is, isn't he?

48:08.019 --> 48:09.886
You're doing
a great job with him.

48:09.954 --> 48:10.998
He seems to be
adjusting really well.

48:11.022 --> 48:13.189
Thank you,

48:13.258 --> 48:17.059
although I don't know
if that's really true.

48:17.128 --> 48:18.761
I think he's pretty scared.

48:18.830 --> 48:20.763
I get it.

48:20.832 --> 48:22.243
I was terrified
when my mom passed away,

48:22.267 --> 48:23.566
and I was a freshman in college.

48:23.635 --> 48:25.434
That's right.
You lost your mom, too.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.270
I forgot about that.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.472
I'm sorry.

48:29.540 --> 48:30.540
We were close.

48:31.542 --> 48:33.910
I still miss her.

48:33.978 --> 48:35.411
Most of all,
she was my interpreter.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.780
She was your what?

48:37.849 --> 48:40.583
My interpreter.

48:40.652 --> 48:41.795
Your interpreter?
What does that mean?

48:41.819 --> 48:42.718
Between my dad and I.

48:42.787 --> 48:44.098
We never really saw
eye to eye, so...

48:44.122 --> 48:47.957
You know, Nick,
for what it's worth...

48:49.928 --> 48:51.661
Your dad loves his company,

48:51.729 --> 48:53.429
but he definitely
loves you more.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.333
Just in case you ever
wondered that.

48:58.336 --> 48:59.602
Thanks.

49:02.807 --> 49:04.941
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:05.009 --> 49:05.841
It's Jonah's mom.

49:05.910 --> 49:06.809
I should probably check

49:06.878 --> 49:07.643
and just make sure
everything's okay.

49:07.712 --> 49:08.611
Of course.

49:08.680 --> 49:09.879
I'll be right back.

49:09.948 --> 49:11.814
Yeah.

49:14.118 --> 49:15.017
Hi.

49:15.086 --> 49:16.286
Could I get the check, please?

49:17.221 --> 49:18.387
Just put it on that.

49:19.624 --> 49:21.090
And, uh...

49:21.159 --> 49:22.236
Can I cover
his table as well?

49:22.260 --> 49:23.260
Thanks.

49:25.296 --> 49:26.796
Is everything okay?

49:28.900 --> 49:30.766
Oh, yeah, that's fine.

49:32.704 --> 49:35.571
Okay, great.
I'm going to be home soon.

49:36.574 --> 49:38.641
Awesome.
I appreciate that, thank you.

49:38.710 --> 49:39.976
Bye.

49:41.446 --> 49:42.446
Hi.

49:42.513 --> 49:43.646
Sorry about that.

49:43.715 --> 49:44.847
Everything's fine.

49:44.916 --> 49:45.748
The boys just wanted
to stop for some ice cream,

49:45.817 --> 49:46.817
on the way home.

49:46.884 --> 49:48.351
They're going to drop him off.

49:48.419 --> 49:49.352
Okay, great.

49:49.420 --> 49:50.553
Well, can I give you a ride?

49:50.621 --> 49:54.890
Um, Ellie was actually
going to pick me up, but...

49:54.959 --> 49:55.992
If you don't mind, sure.

49:56.060 --> 49:58.527
Did we get two bills?

49:58.596 --> 50:01.430
No, it's all good.

50:01.499 --> 50:02.631
Okay.

50:02.700 --> 50:03.833
Thank you for dinner.

50:05.737 --> 50:07.069
It was my pleasure.

50:07.138 --> 50:08.537
I had a really nice time.

50:08.606 --> 50:10.006
Yeah, me too.

50:24.555 --> 50:25.755
So, it was...

50:25.823 --> 50:27.423
Really great
seeing you again.

50:27.492 --> 50:30.026
Yeah, you too.

50:30.094 --> 50:32.334
Do you think we might be able
to do that some other time?

50:35.400 --> 50:36.400
Hey, Nick!

50:36.434 --> 50:37.533
Scotty.

50:39.137 --> 50:40.870
Is the chair in the back?

50:40.938 --> 50:41.670
I'll grab it.

50:41.739 --> 50:42.938
Thank you.

50:43.007 --> 50:44.118
Thank you for
dropping him off!

50:44.142 --> 50:45.174
I appreciate that.

50:45.243 --> 50:46.609
Is that
your car, Nick?

50:46.677 --> 50:48.978
Yes, that is
my car, Scotty.

50:50.048 --> 50:50.679
You got him?

50:50.748 --> 50:52.481
Yup.

50:53.618 --> 50:54.850
There we go.

50:54.919 --> 50:55.919
Perfect.

50:55.987 --> 50:57.153
Can we go for a ride?

50:57.221 --> 50:58.298
Oh, kiddo,
it's past your bedtime!

50:58.322 --> 50:59.789
Does it have
a different engine

50:59.857 --> 51:01.624
than most cars do?

51:01.692 --> 51:03.492
How fast can it go?

51:03.561 --> 51:04.727
Well, it's got
a 3.6 liter

51:04.796 --> 51:06.028
six speed

51:06.097 --> 51:08.831
with 315 horsepower.

51:08.900 --> 51:10.199
zero to 60 in 5 seconds,

51:10.268 --> 51:11.867
and it goes up to
180 miles an hour,

51:11.936 --> 51:14.103
which I have
never done,

51:14.172 --> 51:17.239
because that would be illegal
and very unsafe.

51:17.308 --> 51:18.919
I wish we could get my car
to go that fast.

51:18.943 --> 51:20.142
I don't.

51:20.211 --> 51:21.544
Your car?

51:21.612 --> 51:23.779
Oh, my soapbox derby car.

51:23.848 --> 51:24.992
You know they do
the soapbox derby race

51:25.016 --> 51:27.416
every year at Christmas time.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.318
Oh, you won that contest

51:29.387 --> 51:30.686
three years in a row,
too, right?

51:30.755 --> 51:32.399
Hang on a second,
when did this start this?

51:32.423 --> 51:33.634
They didn't have that
when we were kids.

51:33.658 --> 51:34.658
You could
help me.

51:34.725 --> 51:36.525
I have to build my car
from scratch!

51:36.594 --> 51:37.626
Scotty,

51:37.695 --> 51:40.162
I would love to help you
build your go-kart.

51:41.532 --> 51:45.835
Uh... except
I don't know if I should.

51:45.903 --> 51:47.281
I don't think
your mom wants me to...

51:47.305 --> 51:48.804
Mom, don't worry.

51:48.873 --> 51:50.150
We can't make it
go 180 miles an hour.

51:51.742 --> 51:53.008
No, it's...

51:53.077 --> 51:54.777
It's fine
if Nick wants to help,

51:54.846 --> 51:56.423
I just want to make sure
that Nick has the time.

51:56.447 --> 51:58.180
I have the time.

51:58.249 --> 51:59.148
And I won't be late.

51:59.217 --> 52:00.217
Awesome.

52:01.319 --> 52:02.585
Okay, I think we've had

52:02.653 --> 52:03.986
enough sugar
and excitement

52:04.055 --> 52:05.354
for one night.

52:05.423 --> 52:06.322
You need to get
up to bed

52:06.390 --> 52:07.390
and get dressed.

52:07.425 --> 52:08.991
I'll be up
in a minute, okay?

52:09.060 --> 52:10.893
'Night, Nick.

52:10.962 --> 52:14.363
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

52:14.432 --> 52:16.165
Yeah, I'm...

52:16.234 --> 52:17.166
You know what,

52:17.235 --> 52:18.033
he actually really needs
the excitement.

52:18.102 --> 52:19.869
And a little
distraction right now.

52:20.972 --> 52:22.605
I just want to make sure...

52:22.673 --> 52:24.073
I know.

52:24.909 --> 52:25.909
Okay.

52:27.545 --> 52:28.477
'Night, Mia.

52:28.546 --> 52:29.645
Good night.

52:49.967 --> 52:52.768
All righty.

52:52.837 --> 52:53.636
It's coming along, hey?

52:53.704 --> 52:54.837
Yeah.

52:57.108 --> 52:59.041
Want to pass
the 1/8th?

52:59.110 --> 53:00.476
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:02.413 --> 53:03.445
Well, hello.

53:03.514 --> 53:04.747
Mia.

53:04.815 --> 53:06.015
Hey, mom.

53:06.083 --> 53:07.550
I hope you don't
mind me

53:07.618 --> 53:08.517
just stopping by,

53:08.586 --> 53:09.485
but I had
a bunch of great ideas,

53:09.554 --> 53:10.564
and we only have
a couple of weeks

53:10.588 --> 53:11.453
to finish this thing.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.355
Not at all.

53:13.424 --> 53:14.690
This is great.
I love this.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.471
You guys must be getting hungry

53:17.495 --> 53:18.594
from all this hard work.

53:18.663 --> 53:21.430
Would you like to stay
for dinner?

53:22.366 --> 53:26.135
Oh, I'd love to,
but, uh, I'm booked.

53:26.204 --> 53:28.571
Valerie fry,
our banker,

53:28.639 --> 53:29.872
wanted to go over
some things,

53:29.941 --> 53:31.440
and I'm meeting her for dinner.

53:31.509 --> 53:32.541
Yes, Valerie.

53:32.610 --> 53:34.577
She's nice.

53:34.645 --> 53:35.778
You okay?

53:35.846 --> 53:37.746
I'm... I'm great.

53:37.815 --> 53:38.981
I'm great.

53:39.050 --> 53:40.327
I'm just going to
whip up something

53:40.351 --> 53:41.116
for Scotty and I,

53:41.185 --> 53:42.465
because you have
a business date.

53:43.354 --> 53:44.620
Dinner.

53:44.689 --> 53:45.732
You have a business dinner.

53:45.756 --> 53:46.756
He has a business dinner.

53:48.559 --> 53:49.992
I'll see you soon, okay?

53:51.462 --> 53:52.561
Mia...

53:58.669 --> 53:59.989
Well, that could have
went better.

54:16.654 --> 54:17.694
You know,
part of me thinks

54:17.755 --> 54:20.389
we can open more stores
to increase revenue.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.557
Of course.

54:21.626 --> 54:22.736
But I must admit that
my father's pride and joy

54:22.760 --> 54:25.361
in being the only store
makes sense to me.

54:25.429 --> 54:28.697
You see, our store
is a destination.

54:28.766 --> 54:30.978
People get off the highway
on their way to somewhere else

54:31.002 --> 54:31.900
to stop in the town

54:31.969 --> 54:33.235
with the huge
Santa hat store.

54:33.304 --> 54:34.937
I think that counts
for something.

54:35.006 --> 54:36.839
Nick, your dad has already
tried to sell me

54:36.907 --> 54:38.467
on the nostalgic elements
of this place,

54:38.509 --> 54:41.710
but nostalgia doesn't
pay off bank loans.

54:41.779 --> 54:42.856
Yeah, I know,
I'm just saying,

54:42.880 --> 54:43.991
I don't think we
need to get rid of

54:44.015 --> 54:46.048
all the personality
and history out of hats off

54:46.117 --> 54:47.616
in order to
increase revenue.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.551
We can build on that
personality and history.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.620
Mm-hmm.

54:50.655 --> 54:52.488
You know, you should
really talk to Mia.

54:52.556 --> 54:54.456
She's got a lot of great ideas,

54:54.525 --> 54:55.702
and she gets
the heart of this place,

54:55.726 --> 54:58.327
but unlike my father,
she's open to modernization.

54:58.396 --> 55:01.297
This is our warehouse,
where the magic happens.

55:01.365 --> 55:02.398
Ah.

55:03.668 --> 55:05.067
Mia, hi!

55:05.136 --> 55:06.168
Hi!

55:06.237 --> 55:07.503
What are you doing?

55:07.571 --> 55:09.116
Don't we have warehouse
guys to do that job?

55:09.140 --> 55:11.106
Well, they do
all the bigger stuff,

55:11.175 --> 55:12.853
but I try to take care of
the smaller things.

55:12.877 --> 55:14.343
You remember Valerie?

55:14.412 --> 55:16.245
I was just showing her
the warehouse.

55:16.314 --> 55:18.047
Hi. Yeah, it's-
it's nice to see you again.

55:18.115 --> 55:19.915
Maya, hi there.

55:19.984 --> 55:21.550
"Mia."

55:24.021 --> 55:26.088
Um, I was just telling
Valerie here

55:26.157 --> 55:28.524
about some of your ideas

55:28.592 --> 55:30.726
to bring hats off
into the 21st century

55:30.795 --> 55:32.294
without sacrificing
the charm.

55:32.363 --> 55:34.830
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.

55:36.267 --> 55:37.533
So, what are you doing?

55:37.601 --> 55:41.236
Nick, I'm just filling boxes.

55:41.305 --> 55:42.638
Can I try?

55:43.641 --> 55:44.818
You... you want to pack boxes?

55:44.842 --> 55:46.709
Yes, I want to try.

55:46.777 --> 55:48.043
- Okay.
- Do you mind?

55:48.112 --> 55:49.011
No.

55:49.080 --> 55:51.046
Nick, I'm gonna head
back upstairs,

55:51.115 --> 55:52.014
to do some work.

55:52.083 --> 55:52.981
All right. Yeah.

55:53.050 --> 55:53.882
I'll see you up there.

55:53.951 --> 55:55.684
Sure, see you.

55:56.587 --> 55:58.020
This has got to be
a man's job.

55:58.089 --> 56:00.422
You're lucky I'm not
making you wear a Santa hat.

56:00.491 --> 56:02.758
So, you do
the bottom layer.

56:02.827 --> 56:03.859
Okay...

56:03.928 --> 56:05.339
Then you pack whatever
the marked merchandise is

56:05.363 --> 56:06.395
that goes in this one,

56:06.464 --> 56:07.896
then you fill another layer,

56:07.965 --> 56:09.565
and, ta-dah!

56:09.633 --> 56:10.432
Great.

56:10.501 --> 56:11.266
You filled a box.

56:11.335 --> 56:12.534
Ta-dah. I got it.

56:13.571 --> 56:14.737
Okay.

56:14.805 --> 56:15.838
That one's almost done,

56:15.906 --> 56:17.084
you might want to do
just a little bit more

56:17.108 --> 56:18.507
and then, you can
do this one.

56:18.576 --> 56:19.341
No problem.

56:19.410 --> 56:20.476
Okay.

56:35.526 --> 56:36.892
Uh...

56:36.961 --> 56:37.993
Nick!

56:38.062 --> 56:39.928
Oh, my gosh.
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

56:40.998 --> 56:42.398
How did you
pull that off?

56:42.466 --> 56:43.866
Stop, stop!

56:43.934 --> 56:45.067
Are you okay?

56:45.136 --> 56:48.337
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

56:49.273 --> 56:50.339
I got it, I got it.

56:50.408 --> 56:51.273
Okay.

56:51.342 --> 56:54.309
Nick, you know
when you got here,

56:54.378 --> 56:55.177
I thought

56:55.246 --> 56:57.312
you were just
so cool, but...

56:57.381 --> 56:58.647
I need to get
back to the store.

56:58.716 --> 57:00.983
I'll see if Sam
can help us with this.

57:01.051 --> 57:02.918
I'm sorry.

57:02.987 --> 57:03.987
Did I hear my name?

57:04.054 --> 57:05.098
I have to get
back to the store

57:05.122 --> 57:05.921
with this box, actually.

57:05.990 --> 57:06.789
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

57:06.857 --> 57:08.290
I'm sorry to
leave you with this.

57:08.359 --> 57:10.125
No, it's cool.
That's my job.

57:10.194 --> 57:11.360
I'm sorry.

57:11.429 --> 57:12.429
I'm sorry.

57:12.463 --> 57:13.262
You took my kids to dinner
the other night,

57:13.330 --> 57:14.229
I appreciate that.

57:14.298 --> 57:16.198
This is fine.

57:16.267 --> 57:17.699
Let me take
this on for you.

57:17.768 --> 57:19.034
About dinner,
no problem.

57:19.103 --> 57:20.113
That's what old friends
are for, right?

57:21.806 --> 57:24.606
Speaking of old times,

57:24.675 --> 57:26.420
I was hoping we could toss
the ball around sometime.

57:26.444 --> 57:27.509
That would be great.

57:27.578 --> 57:28.510
If that's still okay.

57:28.579 --> 57:29.411
Great. Perfect.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.213
Great.
If I get this done.

57:31.282 --> 57:32.581
Ever.

57:32.650 --> 57:34.049
- Oh, man.
- Sorry.

57:34.118 --> 57:36.084
- Bye.
- That's a big pile.

57:37.288 --> 57:38.565
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

57:38.589 --> 57:40.823
Oh, no, Thanksgiving
last year was sad,

57:40.891 --> 57:43.325
but this...
This is awesome.

57:43.394 --> 57:45.427
Look how happy
Scotty looks.

57:46.797 --> 57:47.974
All right, Scotty,
you're the QB.

57:47.998 --> 57:48.897
You ready?

57:48.966 --> 57:50.032
Let's get
this game going!

57:50.100 --> 57:51.934
blue 42!
Hut! Hut! Hut!

57:53.871 --> 57:54.871
Hands up! Hands up!

57:59.577 --> 58:00.676
Touchdown!

58:01.712 --> 58:02.911
Touchdown!

58:02.980 --> 58:03.879
Whoo!

58:03.948 --> 58:04.713
Yeah.

58:04.782 --> 58:06.148
Come on!

58:06.217 --> 58:07.694
If you're not going to fall
right in love with him,

58:07.718 --> 58:08.650
can I?

58:08.719 --> 58:10.319
Ellie, you have to stop.
He's leaving.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.858
He likes the big fancy types.

58:15.926 --> 58:17.192
You know?

58:17.261 --> 58:19.361
You could get a little fancy

58:19.430 --> 58:20.295
if you wanted.

58:20.364 --> 58:22.798
Oh, you think
I can get a little fancy?

58:22.867 --> 58:23.944
Oh, I know
you could get fancy.

58:26.103 --> 58:27.603
One, two, three, go!

58:28.672 --> 58:29.538
Let's go, Scotty!

58:30.608 --> 58:31.540
Whoa!

58:31.609 --> 58:34.276
Touchdown!

58:34.345 --> 58:35.844
I don't know,
do you want to play?

58:35.913 --> 58:37.779
You want to play?

58:37.848 --> 58:38.848
I kind of
want to play.

58:40.317 --> 58:42.062
Okay, guys, I think
we're playing on this one.

58:42.086 --> 58:43.151
All right,
come on in here.

58:43.220 --> 58:45.153
All right, we're going to try
a running play.

58:45.222 --> 58:46.488
A running play?

58:46.557 --> 58:47.567
- Are you ready for this one?
- I can't do a running play.

58:47.591 --> 58:48.490
That makes no sense.

58:48.559 --> 58:50.459
Just trust me.

58:50.528 --> 58:52.127
Ready?

58:52.196 --> 58:53.462
And...

58:53.531 --> 58:55.197
Go!

58:55.266 --> 58:57.099
Come on, hands up!

58:57.167 --> 58:58.267
Go on.

58:58.335 --> 58:59.167
Go!

58:59.236 --> 59:00.269
Go, Scotty!

59:01.872 --> 59:03.138
Yeah, Scotty!

59:03.207 --> 59:04.139
Touchdown!

59:05.142 --> 59:07.543
Good job, honey!

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:51.613
Excuse me.

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:52.814
You ready?

01:00:52.883 --> 01:00:53.883
Mom...

01:00:54.918 --> 01:00:56.351
It's a soapbox derby.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.940
You didn't have to get
so well dressed.

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:00.522
Actually, I think
she looks perfect.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.959
All right, you ready to go?

01:01:04.028 --> 01:01:04.926
The race is about to begin.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.094
Remember what I told you.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.163
Good luck.

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:08.897
Thanks, Nick.

01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:09.865
- You ready, honey?
- Yeah!

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:10.999
Put your seat belt on.

01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:14.803
You put
a seatbelt in there?

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:16.104
Of course.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.607
And you can't see it,

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:19.541
but his legs are cushioned
with pillows

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:20.720
and, believe it or not,
bubble wrap.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.644
So if there was
any kind of crash,

01:01:22.713 --> 01:01:23.512
he'd be okay.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.479
Wow.

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:26.314
Oh, and I did a lot of research

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:27.494
on how to make it
really, really fast...

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.650
Nick!

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:30.318
But then I chose
not to employ

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:31.387
any of those ideas.

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.355
He doesn't have to win
every competition.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.434
You gotta keep
the kid humble.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.590
Don't worry,
he'll be okay.

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:39.628
Thank you.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:44.766
Go, Scotty!

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.069
Go, honey!

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:48.377
I'll see you
at the finish line!

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.839
Come on, let's go.

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:14.863
Good job!

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.866
We did it!

01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:33.749
Hey, thank you for
being there for him today.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:36.384
It really means
a lot to him.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:37.919
No problem.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:40.388
You know, I think
you're right,

01:02:40.457 --> 01:02:42.124
it's a big deal
for Scotty.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:43.352
But he does have
a good point,

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:45.427
you are a tiny bit
overdressed.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:49.030
But you know,

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.579
if you wanted to get
dressed up again,

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:52.367
say, maybe
next Friday night,

01:02:52.436 --> 01:02:54.136
I think we could find
an appropriate place

01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:55.204
to take that dress.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:13.822
Scotty, you were
awesome today, kiddo.

01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:15.056
Thanks, mom.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.658
It felt awesome.

01:03:16.727 --> 01:03:18.326
Hey, you know,
maybe to celebrate,

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.028
you want to go
have a sleepover

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:21.463
at Jonah's on Friday?

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:22.264
Sure.

01:03:22.332 --> 01:03:23.799
But what are you going to do?

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:26.735
I think mom's going to
go have dinner at a restaurant.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:28.870
Speaking of dinner,

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.138
you must be
getting hungry.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:31.940
What do you feel like?

01:03:32.709 --> 01:03:33.709
Mom?

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:36.645
Yeah?

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:38.713
I felt really
strong today.

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:41.850
Like I could do anything...

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.052
If I wasn't in this wheelchair.

01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.160
I think...

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.129
I think I'm ready to try again.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:55.697
To walk.

01:03:55.766 --> 01:03:57.632
Can I...

01:03:57.701 --> 01:04:00.702
Can I go back
to physical therapy?

01:04:01.772 --> 01:04:03.338
Kiddo...

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.873
I am so happy
to hear you say that.

01:04:06.643 --> 01:04:07.843
Yes.

01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:09.656
I will call the doctor
first thing tomorrow morning

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:12.180
and we'll get you an appointment
for next week, okay?

01:04:12.249 --> 01:04:13.249
Okay.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:14.482
'Cause then

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:16.218
me and Nick can do
more fun stuff.

01:04:23.327 --> 01:04:26.895
I love you.

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.516
Hey, guys.

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:49.585
Happy Friday.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.053
Don't you look lovely.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.021
What's the occasion?

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.457
Just... dinner.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:04:59.861
Now, is all
the food ordered

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.029
for the Christmas party?

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:03.098
Yes, but you still have
to choose the desserts.

01:05:03.166 --> 01:05:04.299
The desserts?

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:06.668
Hi, Mr. Bowers,
Joann.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:08.069
Oh, hello, Mia.

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:10.071
To what do we owe this honor?

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:12.574
I'm going to see Nick.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:22.584
Very good.

01:05:22.653 --> 01:05:24.853
Valerie, I'm reluctant
to suggest those measures.

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:27.756
It's just not how I want
to handle things.

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:35.397
If I must...

01:05:35.465 --> 01:05:37.699
The quickest way
to improve revenue

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:40.402
is to reduce employee benefits.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:42.282
If we paid less
into the health-care program...

01:05:42.306 --> 01:05:43.371
Absolutely.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.351
We could save the company
tens of thousands a year.

01:05:45.375 --> 01:05:47.709
It might also be
possible to cut staff.

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:49.058
The warehouse
and stockroom group

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:51.813
could handle a downsizing

01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:53.092
without a significant delay
in order delivery.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.616
Think of it this way, Nick.

01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:56.718
The faster you get
things in shape here,

01:05:56.787 --> 01:05:58.520
the faster you can go
back to New York

01:05:58.588 --> 01:05:59.721
and your real life.

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.358
Yeah.

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:06.729
Oh, uh, Mia?

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:14.102
You know...

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.971
My bank has an office
in Manhattan.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:19.040
For once, it might be nice
to hang out for pleasure

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.342
rather than work.

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:24.079
Yeah, val, that sounds good.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:27.482
Can we just work on
finishing the business plan?

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:28.483
Oh.

01:06:28.552 --> 01:06:29.985
Sure.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.786
Great.

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:46.301
Your bank has been
with the hats off family

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:47.602
since the company's start.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.404
They should know
we're good for the money.

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:51.039
We just need some time
to restructure,

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.474
get the online business up.

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:54.582
Maybe work on some better
advertising and marketing.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:57.112
"We?"

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:59.014
"The hats off family?"

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:02.584
What can I say?

01:07:02.652 --> 01:07:05.120
This place is growing on me.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:07.655
There's some good stuff
and people here.

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:08.656
Oh, speaking of which,

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:11.926
I've got to go.

01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:13.194
Excuse me.

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.766
Good night, dad, Joann.

01:07:17.834 --> 01:07:19.567
Uh, son, have you
talked to Mia?

01:07:19.636 --> 01:07:22.003
I'm actually going to
see her right now.

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:27.942
Mia, hi.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.812
Are you all right?

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:31.881
Nick, how could you?

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:33.715
What do you mean?
What did I do?

01:07:33.784 --> 01:07:36.151
You know, I know you've had fun
goofing off with Scotty...

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:37.285
Goofing off?

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:38.798
But he needs
a consistent male role model

01:07:38.822 --> 01:07:39.921
in his life.

01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:41.434
He needs somebody
that he can look up to.

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:43.391
He's had enough struggle
and disappointment.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.893
He doesn't need any more.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.461
I didn't mean
to disappoint him.

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:47.530
Or you.

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:48.797
What did I do wrong?

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:50.198
We're just different.

01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.399
You belong in New York,

01:07:51.468 --> 01:07:53.234
and I'm sure you're dying
to get back there.

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:54.702
Actually,
I've been thinking, I...

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:56.315
And you know you're
not a part of our family.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:58.006
It's not right for you

01:07:58.075 --> 01:08:00.041
to pretend like you are.

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:02.078
I'm going to go.

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:14.856
Nick,

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:15.925
hi.

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:16.925
Hi.

01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:18.493
Do you have dinner plans?

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:21.296
Yeah, it, uh...

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:24.165
It turns out they got canceled.

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.367
I still have the reservation.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.303
You hungry?

01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:38.813
You know, I almost went
to Columbia for my MBA.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.915
We could have reconnected
years ago.

01:08:40.984 --> 01:08:43.118
But I didn't think I could
handle the winters there,

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.120
so I went to Stanford.

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:50.725
Actually, one of my best
friends from business school

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:53.495
has this phenomenal house
in east Hampton.

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.763
She's been begging me
to come up this summer.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:58.800
Perhaps you could
join us?

01:09:00.103 --> 01:09:01.103
Hmm?

01:09:02.671 --> 01:09:04.171
If I wanted to have
dinner alone,

01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:05.874
I could have done that.

01:09:05.942 --> 01:09:09.210
val, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:11.613
This probably wasn't
such a great idea.

01:09:14.084 --> 01:09:16.484
This is a very romantic
restaurant, Nick.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:18.118
Who was the reservation
intended for?

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:20.523
Mia, the store manager.

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:22.924
Huh.

01:09:22.993 --> 01:09:25.292
Interesting.

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:27.127
I mean, you two did look
a little chummy

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:28.462
the other day,

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:29.675
but I never
would have thought

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:32.267
a small-town girl
would be your type.

01:09:34.237 --> 01:09:35.136
Hey...

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:36.249
Hey, aren't you
supposed to be

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:37.138
on your big date?

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:44.078
I can't work at hats off
to Christmas anymore.

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:45.779
Whoa. Why?

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.854
Nick is cutting benefits,

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:53.988
and right before

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:56.424
Scotty's ready to go into
physical therapy again.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:01.529
I have to leave the company.

01:10:02.699 --> 01:10:04.532
Will you get me an interview
with your boss?

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:05.533
Yeah.

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:06.802
Yeah, yeah, of course, I will.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:08.469
Thank you.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:09.571
It's gonna be okay.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:19.681
val, I'm really sorry
if I led you on.

01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:24.586
I'm going to make this easier.

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:28.590
I'm recommending

01:10:28.658 --> 01:10:30.658
that the bank maintain
your current line of credit.

01:10:31.828 --> 01:10:33.628
Really?

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:35.897
That is great news.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:36.898
Providing you have

01:10:36.967 --> 01:10:38.600
an ongoing management role.

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:43.137
You've really brought
a fresh, modern,

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:46.808
competent level of leadership
to the company.

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:50.478
I trust you,
the bank trusts you.

01:10:50.547 --> 01:10:52.847
We'll even extend hats off
a small additional loan

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.582
to help build up
the online business.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:56.929
There will be a review
in a year

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:58.319
to see how well you're using it,

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:01.189
but I'm sure you can make
this business work.

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:04.692
Nick...

01:11:04.761 --> 01:11:06.427
This is where you belong.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:11.099
Good luck.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:12.333
Thank you.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:14.035
Guys, listen up!

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:15.336
Christmas
is around the corner,

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:16.882
which means
we're down to rush orders, okay?

01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:19.140
I need to get
the truck loaded asap

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:20.875
and could someone
please get down a pallet

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:22.810
of size-three shipping boxes?

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:24.078
I'm on it, Sam.

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:25.147
Thank you, Phil.

01:11:34.491 --> 01:11:37.625
It's always Christmas
here at hats off to Christmas.

01:11:37.694 --> 01:11:39.761
Mia speaking.

01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:44.332
Yeah, we have those in stock.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:47.135
Come on by.

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:12.527
Hey, son, you okay?

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:15.163
I don't know, dad.

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:16.297
You want to talk?

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:18.399
I know that was always
your mother's domain, but...

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:22.403
Dad... here.
You don't look so good.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:25.206
Phil fell off a ladder
in the stockroom!

01:12:25.275 --> 01:12:26.474
What?

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:35.717
Oh, no, what happened?

01:12:35.785 --> 01:12:37.652
It looks worse
than it is.

01:12:37.721 --> 01:12:39.153
This is what happens
when you fall.

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:41.723
It's just precautionary.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.092
Well, good thing
he has insurance.

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.493
Uh...

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:48.429
even if he's fine,
he'll need some time to rest up.

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:50.131
The Christmas party
is in three days.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.033
I don't think
we'll have a Santa.

01:12:52.102 --> 01:12:53.668
Well, you used to do it, boss.

01:12:53.737 --> 01:12:54.914
Why not just throw it on
for old time's sake?

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:58.272
Well, I did always enjoy
donning the old red...

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:02.143
With all due
respect, Mr. Bowers,

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.479
you're going to get
half the kids in town

01:13:04.547 --> 01:13:05.913
sick with that cold.

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:08.549
Mia's right.
It wouldn't be responsible.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:09.550
You think you could
do it, Sam?

01:13:09.619 --> 01:13:11.419
Oh, sir, you know I'd love to,

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:13.128
but I have to watch my girls
at the party.

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:14.856
But I tell you,

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:16.764
I would pay money to see Nick
put that suit on.

01:13:18.294 --> 01:13:19.093
No, no.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:19.961
I'm definitely not

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:21.162
the right person
for the job.

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.231
Agreed.

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:28.336
Sorry, um...

01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:29.303
I'm going to just

01:13:29.372 --> 01:13:30.638
get back to work.

01:13:30.707 --> 01:13:32.006
Yeah, come on.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.708
Back to work, guys.
We need to finish.

01:13:35.712 --> 01:13:39.447
Son, come and
take a walk with me.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:41.549
Let's have a talk.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:46.587
After you, dad.

01:13:46.656 --> 01:13:48.055
Thanks.

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.360
Hey, how are you doing?

01:13:52.429 --> 01:13:55.496
Ah... I'm relieved
about the loan.

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:58.466
Me too.

01:13:58.535 --> 01:14:02.603
Nick, you know how proud
I am of you, right?

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:05.239
Come on, you don't
have to say that, dad.

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:07.909
I know you've never really
approved of my decisions.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:08.910
You're right,

01:14:08.978 --> 01:14:09.989
but that's just because
I want you here,

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:12.013
with me
and with the company.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:13.592
I always thought
it would be really special

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.950
to work side by side
with my one and only son,

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:17.418
and then one day,

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:19.353
to pass my legacy
on to you.

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:23.558
But I realize now
I was wrong.

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.026
But playing Santa?

01:14:25.094 --> 01:14:27.228
Son, that is just
a wonderful experience.

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:29.363
Making all those people
and all those kids happy,

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:30.998
there's nothing like it,

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:34.035
so just do us both
a favor,

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:37.905
put the suit on
for the Christmas party.

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.708
Consider it
your last hurrah.

01:14:40.777 --> 01:14:41.709
I spoke to Valerie.

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:43.678
As long as you check in
on a monthly basis,

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:47.048
you don't need
to be here full time.

01:14:47.116 --> 01:14:49.584
I'll stop pushing
my dream on you

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:54.255
and you can go live your life
the way you want to.

01:14:54.324 --> 01:14:55.857
Dad?

01:14:55.925 --> 01:14:58.759
Yes, son?

01:14:58.828 --> 01:15:03.197
I don't know how I want to
live my life anymore.

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:21.649
Excited for
the Christmas party?

01:15:21.718 --> 01:15:22.517
Nick'll be there, right?

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:24.051
Yeah.

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.620
Nick will be there.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.399
I think tomorrow's
going to be a lot of fun.

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:28.534
Do you want to
go get dressed

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:29.735
and I'll finish
making your breakfast?

01:15:29.759 --> 01:15:32.193
Sure, mom.

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:14.735
Hey, dad.

01:16:16.439 --> 01:16:18.472
I think you need
to see this.

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:21.142
"Dear Mr. Bowers,

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:22.076
"I want to thank you

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:23.711
"for the last 10 years
of employment.

01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:25.046
"I have come to the conclusion

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:27.848
"that it is time for me
to move on to new endeavors.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:28.950
"It is with great regret

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.885
"that I must tender
my resignation.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:34.922
Sincerely, Mia winters."

01:16:43.633 --> 01:16:45.466
I think we can do that.

01:16:45.535 --> 01:16:47.635
Who's next?

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:48.769
Come on.

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:51.105
Come on, everyone!

01:16:51.174 --> 01:16:52.540
Gather round!

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:56.877
Come on,
it's Christmas!

01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:08.889
I want to thank everyone.

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.959
Thank you for joining us
for the annual Christmas party.

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:15.796
Thank you for your hard work
all year long.

01:17:15.865 --> 01:17:18.265
I know it's been a rough year
for some of you,

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:19.467
but I appreciate the effort

01:17:19.535 --> 01:17:23.204
and the love that you put
into your jobs.

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:26.307
Hats off to Christmas
is a community.

01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:31.646
No, it's more than a community,
it's family!

01:17:37.186 --> 01:17:40.121
And families
are always changing.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:46.193
I've been running this company
for the past 40 years,

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:48.796
and I have, um...

01:17:48.865 --> 01:17:52.033
I've loved every minute of it,

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:54.001
but, uh...

01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:57.672
The time has come for me
to step aside.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:01.509
My son, Nick,
who many of you know,

01:18:01.577 --> 01:18:03.177
who couldn't be here today.

01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:05.780
But when he comes back,

01:18:05.848 --> 01:18:07.915
I'll be stepping into
my new role

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:09.116
as chairman
of the board,

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:13.020
and Nick will be taking over
as president and CEO,

01:18:13.089 --> 01:18:15.389
and if anybody
can juggle it all,

01:18:15.458 --> 01:18:16.290
it's Nick.

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:25.733
However, to be fair,

01:18:25.802 --> 01:18:27.968
his acceptance of his new post
is contingent

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:30.738
upon promoting
a certain store manager

01:18:30.807 --> 01:18:32.573
to the newly created position

01:18:32.642 --> 01:18:37.578
of vice president
of sales and marketing.

01:18:46.289 --> 01:18:48.556
And lastly, I've decided

01:18:48.624 --> 01:18:50.391
if this is truly
a family company,

01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:52.460
it should be shared
among its members.

01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:54.862
Your bonuses this year

01:18:54.931 --> 01:18:58.933
will be in the form
of shares of the company stock.

01:18:59.001 --> 01:19:02.103
You're all
about to become part-owners

01:19:02.171 --> 01:19:04.071
of hats off to Christmas!

01:19:09.812 --> 01:19:13.314
And don't forget to ask Santa
for your Christmas wish

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.449
before he's got to head back
to the north pole!

01:19:18.821 --> 01:19:20.454
Thanks, son.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:21.756
Thanks, dad.

01:19:21.824 --> 01:19:23.324
All right,

01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:24.592
who's first?

01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:25.740
Come on up here, young man.

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:30.397
Come on up here.

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:45.379
Can I go ask Santa
for my Christmas wish?

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:46.547
Of course, kiddo.

01:19:48.651 --> 01:19:49.583
Come on.

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:50.692
I'm going to be
right here.

01:19:50.753 --> 01:19:51.619
Hi, Santa!

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:53.220
Well, hello there, Scotty!

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.089
You know my name!

01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:56.168
Of course,
I know your name.

01:19:56.192 --> 01:19:58.692
I know the names
of every girl and boy,

01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:00.494
especially the ones
who are very, very good!

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:01.563
Ho, ho, ho!

01:20:03.099 --> 01:20:04.899
What's your biggest
Christmas wish?

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:08.736
Well, I actually have
two Christmas wishes.

01:20:08.805 --> 01:20:09.805
Is that all right?

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.939
That's most certainly
all right, Scotty.

01:20:12.008 --> 01:20:14.975
My first one
is actually for my mom.

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:19.280
I want her to get back
together with her boyfriend.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:23.250
I didn't realize

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:24.630
your mother
had a boyfriend, Scott.

01:20:24.654 --> 01:20:28.355
Well, she never actually
really called him that,

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.424
but if you love someone,

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:33.460
doesn't that just make them
your boyfriend?

01:20:35.531 --> 01:20:38.299
My mom was really sad
after my dad died.

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:42.036
And being with Nick...

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:46.006
Made her feel better,

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:49.076
so shouldn't that just mean
that they should be together?

01:20:51.981 --> 01:20:56.483
Well, Santa
sure thinks so,

01:20:56.552 --> 01:20:58.197
but you're going to have to
let your mom and Nick

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:01.288
work that out on their own,

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:03.190
but I can assure you

01:21:03.259 --> 01:21:04.259
and your mom

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:06.060
that that's Nick's
biggest wish as well.

01:21:09.232 --> 01:21:12.933
Now, Scotty, tell me
what's your Christmas wish?

01:21:13.002 --> 01:21:14.401
Well, I'm not really sure

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.370
if you can
Grant my second wish.

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:20.007
I think it's something
I have to do all by myself.

01:21:20.076 --> 01:21:21.342
What's that?

01:21:22.845 --> 01:21:24.211
Well...

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.581
I just...

01:21:45.835 --> 01:21:47.034
Oh, honey!

01:21:50.673 --> 01:21:51.772
You're walking.

01:21:51.841 --> 01:21:53.007
Way to go, buddy.

01:21:53.075 --> 01:21:54.642
I mean, um,

01:21:54.710 --> 01:21:56.577
ho, ho, ho!

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:58.012
Mom, I'm really tired.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.080
Can I sit down now?

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:01.115
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:02.516
Careful.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:03.817
Kiddo, I'm so
proud of you.

01:22:03.886 --> 01:22:05.119
How do you feel?

01:22:05.187 --> 01:22:06.187
Are you okay?

01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:08.889
Yeah, I'm okay, mom.

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:11.659
You don't have to worry
about me so much now.

01:22:12.895 --> 01:22:15.529
I think you can make up
with Nick now.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:18.933
But I'm Santa!

01:22:19.001 --> 01:22:20.234
Come on, guys.

01:22:20.303 --> 01:22:22.536
I know who you are.

01:22:28.611 --> 01:22:30.077
I think we just witnessed

01:22:30.146 --> 01:22:33.480
an actual Christmas miracle.

01:22:33.549 --> 01:22:35.849
It is a profound thing

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:38.619
when you realize that your kid
is wiser than you are.

01:22:39.655 --> 01:22:41.121
Hey...

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:44.491
You wouldn't happen to be
granting Christmas wishes still,

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.759
would you?

01:22:45.828 --> 01:22:48.829
Of course, young lady!

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.066
What is your biggest
Christmas wish?

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:53.600
Well, then,

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:56.603
I think I'm going to follow
in my son's footsteps...

01:22:57.807 --> 01:22:59.573
...and make one of my own dreams
come true.
