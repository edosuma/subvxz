WEBVTT

00:05.873 --> 00:09.277
(Tessa) THEY SAY IT'S
ALWAYS QUIET BEFORE THE STORM,

00:09.343 --> 00:11.412
BUT HERE IN THE SUBURBS,

00:11.479 --> 00:13.281
IT'S JUST QUIET.

00:18.686 --> 00:22.490
(swallows)

00:22.556 --> 00:24.558
WHAT WAS THAT?

00:25.826 --> 00:29.297
I... SWALLOWED.

00:31.965 --> 00:34.902
(crunching softly)

00:34.968 --> 00:35.936
HEAR THAT?

00:36.003 --> 00:37.638
I CAN'T EAT ANY QUIETER.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.307
NO. LISTEN.

00:39.373 --> 00:42.009
(sirens wailing in distance)

00:42.076 --> 00:45.313
SIRENS. POLICE SIRENS!

00:45.379 --> 00:47.448
HOW GREAT IS IT TO NOT HEAR
THAT ALL THE TIME?

00:47.515 --> 00:50.084
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT SOUNDS LIKE HOME.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.323
WHAT CHIRPING BIRDS
ARE TO THE SUBURBS,

00:55.389 --> 00:57.458
POLICE SIRENS ARE TO THE CITY,

00:57.525 --> 01:01.162
AND FOR A HOMESICK GIRL,
THIS WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.697
A SIREN COULD SIGNIFY
ALMOST ANYTHING--

01:03.764 --> 01:06.134
ARSON, MURDER...

01:06.200 --> 01:07.468
DOLLS!
DOLLS?

01:07.535 --> 01:08.669
(voice breaking)
SOMEONE STOLE

01:08.736 --> 01:10.504
MY ENTIRE SHIRLEY TEMPLE
DOLL COLLECTION.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.972
CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THE DOLLS, MA'AM?

01:12.039 --> 01:14.475
"LOLLIPOP" SHIRLEY WAS LAST SEEN
WEARING A SAILOR OUTFIT.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.111
(police radio chatter)
UM, "CURLY TOP" SHIRLEY WAS

01:17.178 --> 01:19.347
WEARING A RED POLKA DOT DRESS
WITH CAP SLEEVES.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.149
(gasps)
OR WAS THAT "BRIGHT EYES"?

01:21.215 --> 01:23.817
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ME. I'M SO FLUSTERED.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.085
TAKE A DEEP BREATH, MA'AM.

01:25.153 --> 01:26.520
IT'S NATURAL
TO BE A LITTLE SHAKEN UP.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.755
WELL, OF COURSE
I AM SHAKEN UP.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.591
THEY'RE VALUABLE DOLLS,
COLLECTIBLES.

01:30.658 --> 01:32.993
ORIGINAL SHIRLEYS,
MINT CONDISH.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.196
THE COPS ARE HERE FOR DOLLS?

01:35.263 --> 01:37.231
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 4:00 A.M.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.066
THIS IS SO EXCITING.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.067
IT'S PROBABLY
THE MOST EXCITING THING

01:40.134 --> 01:42.403
TO EVER HAPPEN AROUND HERE.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.071
YEAH.

01:44.138 --> 01:45.773
I BET IT IS.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.775
Captioned by
Closed Captioning Services, Inc.

01:47.841 --> 01:52.613
(woman) * LAST NIGHT I HAD
A PLEASANT NIGHTMARE *

01:52.680 --> 01:55.783
* DA-DA-DA-DA,
DA, DA, DA, DA *

01:55.849 --> 01:58.018
I DON'T KNOW.
TRY TO FIT HER IN AT 3:00.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.553
YES!

01:59.620 --> 02:02.156
I AM ON MY WAY IN
RIGHT NOW.

02:02.223 --> 02:04.992
(beep)
GOD. I AM SORRY THAT
I AM LATE.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.494
IT HAS BEEN
A CRAZY MORNING.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.429
(chuckles) I MEAN,
THIS BREAK-IN IS A GIFT.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.231
I MEAN, TERRIBLE
FOR THE SHAYS, OF COURSE,

02:10.298 --> 02:12.166
BUT GREAT IF YOU'RE
IN THE DENTAL GAME.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.434
THEY'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO LOOK

02:13.501 --> 02:14.935
AT THE DOLL'S DENTAL RECORDS,
ARE THEY?

02:15.002 --> 02:17.505
THIS WHOLE TOWN IS ON EDGE.
THEY ARE GRINDING THEIR TEETH.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.006
THEY ARE THRUSTING
THEIR TONGUES.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.641
BASED ON THE PHONE CALLS
THIS MORNING, I'M GOING TO BE

02:20.708 --> 02:22.443
MOLDING MOUTH GUARDS
FOR MONTHS. (chuckles)

02:22.510 --> 02:23.744
WELL, TOO BAD
IT WASN'T A MURDER, HUH?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.279
I WISH.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.114
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU, HUH?

02:27.181 --> 02:29.183
YOU SHOULD BE CASHING IN
ON THIS, TOO.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.384
I'M AN ARCHITECT.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.253
FRIGHTENED PEOPLE RARELY ADD
BONUS ROOMS.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.155
MM, BUT WHAT ABOUT
PANIC ROOMS?

02:35.223 --> 02:38.058
"INSIDE CELEBRITY PANIC ROOMS."
SERIOUSLY?

02:38.125 --> 02:39.427
WAIT. YOU HAVE
A SUBSCRIPTION TO THIS?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.529
YEAH.
CHECK OUT BONO'S SAFE ROOM.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.030
IT DOUBLES
AS A RECORDING STUDIO,

02:43.096 --> 02:45.499
AND JAY-Z's PANIC SHELTER...

02:45.566 --> 02:47.401
(chuckles) IT HAS A COGNAC BAR
AND A DISCO.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.702
YOU REALLY THINK
PEOPLE AROUND HERE

02:48.769 --> 02:50.103
WOULD GO FOR THAT KIND OF THING?
(Dallas) HEY.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.305
HEY.
OH, MY GOD.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.442
GEORGE, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT
THE BREAK-IN?

02:54.508 --> 02:56.344
I AM IN A FULL-BLOWN PANIC.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.978
MY HUSBAND'S OUT OF TOWN.
MM-HMM.

02:58.045 --> 03:01.114
I HAVEN'T FELT THIS VULNERABLE
SINCE I TEST-DROVE A SMART CAR.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.485
DALLAS IS IN A PANIC, GEORGE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS?

03:04.552 --> 03:05.853
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE
A FEW PRECAUTIONS

03:05.919 --> 03:07.255
TO MAKE YOUR HOUSE
FEEL SAFE.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.256
OKAY.
MM?

03:08.322 --> 03:09.457
(gasps) OH.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.059
I WANT IT. I NEED IT.
I HAVE TO HAVE IT.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.494
HOW SOON CAN YOU START?

03:13.561 --> 03:14.928
(chuckles) I'M NOT GONNA
TAKE COMMISSION ON THIS,

03:14.995 --> 03:16.464
BUT YOU CAN GET ME
BREAKFAST.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.299
I'M GONNA HAVE
THE LOBSTER OMELET.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.434
OKAY, I'LL--UH, DALLAS,
ARE YOU ORDERING?

03:20.501 --> 03:22.703
OH, I DON'T EAT IN PUBLIC.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.976
LUNCH WAS GIVING ME
THE EVIL EYE,

03:29.042 --> 03:32.012
AND SO WAS
MY HIGH SCHOOL NEMESIS DALIA,

03:32.079 --> 03:35.849
THE GIRL WHO PERSONIFIED
WHAT I HATE ABOUT THE SUBURBS.

03:35.916 --> 03:37.685
(tray clatters)

03:37.751 --> 03:39.086
HEY.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.388
(Mr. Wolfe, voice amplified)
STUDENTS.

03:40.454 --> 03:45.192
STUDENTS, I MUST INTERRUPT LUNCH
WITH A MESSAGE

03:45.259 --> 03:48.462
THAT IS BOTH SHOCKING
AND UPSETTING.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.664
(students murmuring)
SOMETHING HAPPENED THIS MORNING

03:50.731 --> 03:53.767
THAT THREATENS THE QUALITY
OF LIFE AS WE KNOW IT.

03:53.834 --> 03:57.371
IS THIS ABOUT THE DOLLS?
CAN'T BE ABOUT THE DOLLS.

03:57.438 --> 04:00.874
IT IS ABOUT THE DOLLS.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.043
POTENTIALLY VIOLENT CRIMINALS

04:03.110 --> 04:06.514
ARE TARGETING THE HOMES
OF CHATSWIN HIGH STUDENTS.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.150
THIS WHAT WE CALL
A TEACHABLE MOMENT.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.052
LET'S CHAT ABOUT CRIME.

04:12.119 --> 04:17.425
LISA, YOU'RE A VICTIM...
IN SO MANY WAYS.
MM.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.992
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

04:19.059 --> 04:21.128
(amplified voice)
MM. MNH-MNH.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.731
(crunching and grunting)
MNH-MNH.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.865
(chuckles)

04:24.932 --> 04:26.700
MNH-MNH.

04:26.767 --> 04:31.071
I THINK THAT'S HER WAY
OF SAYING, "IT FEELS BAD."

04:31.138 --> 04:33.240
KEEP EATING.

04:33.307 --> 04:37.144
IF WE DON'T KEEP EATING,
THEY WIN.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.813
(murmuring continues)

04:39.880 --> 04:41.482
I JUST WANT TO SAY,

04:41.549 --> 04:44.852
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS
WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.555
IT WASN'T ME.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.789
NOT YOU.

04:48.856 --> 04:53.527
THIS CRIME SPREE STARTED
WHEN CERTAIN PEOPLE MOVED HERE

04:53.594 --> 04:56.430
FROM NEW YORK, NEW YORK,
NEW--NEW YORK.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.132
(students murmuring)

04:59.199 --> 05:00.968
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.543
REMEMBER RAY
FROM RAY'S PIZZA?

05:09.610 --> 05:10.878
RAY WAS A GOOD GUY.

05:10.944 --> 05:15.282
REMEMBER HOW SAUCY
THEIR SICILIAN WAS?

05:15.349 --> 05:17.485
WE'RE NOT MOVING BACK
TO NEW YORK.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.453
COME ON, GEORGE.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.121
THIS PLACE IS STUPID.

05:21.188 --> 05:24.392
IN THE CITY, IF SOMEONE CALLED
THE COPS OVER MISSING DOLLS,

05:24.458 --> 05:26.226
THEY'D BE ARRESTED.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.596
IT DOES SHOW YOU HOW MUCH LESS
CRIME THERE IS HERE, THOUGH,

05:28.662 --> 05:30.798
HOW MUCH SAFER IT IS
THAN OUR OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.

05:30.864 --> 05:31.999
(doorbell rings)

05:32.065 --> 05:33.601
SAFER? UNH-UNH.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.970
THIS PLACE IS ALL BITCHES,
BACKSTABBERS, AND BOTOX.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.206
(knock on door)

05:39.272 --> 05:41.542
DALIA?

05:42.510 --> 05:44.745
DID I ACCIDENTALLY
SUMMON YOU?

05:44.812 --> 05:45.779
(panting) OH!

05:45.846 --> 05:48.348
THANKS, TESSA,
FOR LETTING US SEEK REFUGE.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.083
THANK YOU.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.820
GEORGE, WE'RE HERE!

05:58.759 --> 06:00.127
WHEN NIGHT FELL,
WE JUST PANICKED,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.496
AND BEING THAT THERE'S
NO PANIC ROOM TO PANIC IN,

06:02.563 --> 06:03.964
WE CAME HERE.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.700
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE FELT LIKE
SITTING DUCKS OVER THERE

06:06.767 --> 06:09.803
IN THAT BIG, PROFESSIONALLY
DECORATED HOUSE OF OURS...
HMM.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.140
BUT THIS FEELS...
WONDERFULLY SAFE, THOUGH.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.075
IT FEELS CLAUSTROPHOBIC.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.145
IT'S NOT CLAUSTROPHOBIC.
IT'S SNUG.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.312
IT FEELS STICKY.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.848
IT DOES FEEL
A LITTLE STICKY.

06:20.914 --> 06:21.849
AHEM.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.585
UH, EXCUSE ME.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.623
MAYBE THEY WANT TO BE
AROUND FAMILIAR FACES.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.758
(whispers) WE ARE NOT
THAT FAMILIAR.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.660
WE JUST MOVED HERE.
IT'S WEIRD.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.528
(lowered voice)
OKAY, IT IS A LITTLE WEIRD,

06:34.595 --> 06:36.296
BUT... (sighs) COME ON.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.865
IT'S JUST ONE NIGHT,

06:37.931 --> 06:41.569
SO LIKE--LIKE OPRAH SAYS
THAT MAYA ANGELOU SAYS,

06:41.635 --> 06:44.538
"TROUBLES ARE A BLESSING
THAT FORCE YOU TO CHANGE."

06:44.605 --> 06:46.173
SO NOW YOU WATCH "OPRAH"?

06:46.239 --> 06:47.274
I'M UP A LOT AT NIGHT.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.810
OH. DALIA SPIT UP
THE TINIEST BIT.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.611
OH.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.012
FROM HER CLAUSTROPHOBIA.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.413
(chuckles)

06:53.481 --> 06:57.551
(lowered voice) YOU FEEL IT?
WE'RE CHANGING, LIKE MAYA SAID.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.592
ALL RIGHT.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.594
OH. WOW. (chuckles)

07:06.660 --> 07:08.128
UH, HOW DID--HOW DID YOU--

07:08.195 --> 07:09.329
DO THIS? (chuckles)

07:09.396 --> 07:11.565
I JUST FOUND A BOX MARKED
"GOOD DISHES,"

07:11.632 --> 07:13.233
AND THEN I USED MY PASHMINA
AS A TABLE RUNNER,

07:13.300 --> 07:15.703
SNUCK OVER TO SHEILA SHAY'S,
CUT A DOZEN ROSES.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.605
IT WAS NOTHING.
FIVE MINUTES.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.439
BUT WE ALWAYS EAT PIZZA OFF
PAPER PLATES. RIGHT, GEORGE?

07:19.507 --> 07:21.074
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN...

07:21.141 --> 07:23.443
(chuckles) IT WOULDN'T KILL US
TO EAT OFF REAL PLATES.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.979
I JUST THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.716
A WOMAN'S TOUCH.
WELL, THAT--THAT'S VERY NICE.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.584
RIGHT, TESSA?
RIGHT, OPRAH.

07:30.651 --> 07:34.154
OH, TESSA. TESSA, HERE.
YOU COME SIT NEXT TO DALIA.

07:34.221 --> 07:37.090
I THOUGHT YOU GIRLS MIGHT WANT
TO GOSSIP ABOUT SCHOOL

07:37.157 --> 07:40.060
AND BOYS AND BIRTH CONTROL.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.495
(sighs)

07:41.562 --> 07:43.030
OKAY. LET'S EAT.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.132
DEAR LORD,

07:45.198 --> 07:47.968
THANK YOU FOR THIS PIZZA
WE ARE ABOUT TO RECEIVE,

07:48.035 --> 07:50.437
AND EVEN THOUGH
ALL THIS CHEESE MEANS

07:50.504 --> 07:52.573
FOR SURE DALIA WILL BE
GASSY TONIGHT,

07:52.640 --> 07:55.475
AND EVEN THOUGH ONE SLICE
PROBABLY EXCEEDS

07:55.543 --> 07:58.912
YOUR ENTIRE RECOMMENDED
DAILY CALORIC INTAKE...

07:58.979 --> 08:01.081
THE LORD SET
A DAILY CALORIC INTAKE.

08:01.148 --> 08:01.982
TESSA, SHH.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.718
WE ASK THAT YOU EASE
OUR DIGESTION

08:04.785 --> 08:07.721
AND HELP US BURN
THIS MEAL OFF SWIFTLY.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.089
AMEN.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.223
AMEN.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.224
(whispers) AMEN.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.626
(doorbell rings)

08:12.693 --> 08:14.962
OH, NO. MISSY, WHERE DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE GOING?

08:15.028 --> 08:17.230
TO ANSWER THE DOOR.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.799
OH, NO. (chuckles)
NO, NO. NO.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.968
WE DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR
DURING DINNER.

08:21.034 --> 08:21.902
MNH-MNH.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.737
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
THEY RING TWICE.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.540
THAT MEANS IT'S URGENT
OR A PACKAGE

08:26.607 --> 08:28.008
OR AN URGENT PACKAGE.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.342
(ring)

08:29.409 --> 08:32.212
I'M SORRY.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.249
AH!

08:36.316 --> 08:37.450
WHAT?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.688
WE DO NOT EAT
UNTIL EVERYONE IS PRESENT.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.658
GIVE IT. GIVE IT TO ME.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.230
TESSA, HI.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.199
JUST LETTING EVERYONE KNOW
THE SHIRLEYS HAVEN'T APPEARED

08:52.265 --> 08:54.935
ON eBay OR ANY OF THE OFFICIAL
SHIRLEY TRADING SITES.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.336
OKAY.
THANKS FOR THE UPDATE.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.538
(crying) IT'S ME, ISN'T IT?

08:58.606 --> 09:01.141
THEY STOLE THE DOLLS
TO GET BACK AT ME.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.943
THIS WAS A PERSONAL ATTACK,
WASN'T IT?

09:03.010 --> 09:04.544
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT REALLY SUPPOSED

09:04.612 --> 09:06.079
TO ANSWER THE DOOR
DURING DINNER.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.615
OH, HEY, SHEILA.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.316
WHAT'S THE WORD
FROM THE CABBAGE PATCH?

09:09.382 --> 09:13.486
THIS IS ALL VERY FUNNY TO YOU,
BUT I AM NOT LAUGHING.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.555
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE A PILE

09:15.623 --> 09:18.458
OF FRESHLY LAUNDERED
DOLL CLOTHES TO FOLD.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.628
THAT'S WHAT MY NIGHT
LOOKS LIKE!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.497
(exhales deeply)

09:24.564 --> 09:27.868
(door creaks)

09:27.935 --> 09:29.436
I'D BEEN SENTENCED TO LIFE
IN THE SUBURBS,

09:29.502 --> 09:30.838
BUT I HELD ON TO THE HOPE

09:30.904 --> 09:35.075
THAT I MIGHT GET OUT EARLY
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

09:35.142 --> 09:38.178
SO THAT MEANT PUTTING UP
WITH DALIA FOR THE NIGHT.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.014
YOUR ROOM IS SO SMALL.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.851
IT'S EVEN SMALLER
THAN THE REST OF YOUR HOUSE.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.387
GENERALLY,
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

09:47.454 --> 09:51.024
THE ROOMS INSIDE THE HOUSE
ARE SMALLER THAN THE HOUSE.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.593
THAT'S HOW THEY FIT 'EM IN.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.663
MY DAD'S AN ARCHITECT.

09:55.729 --> 09:58.699
(clicks tongue)
DRUGSTORE MAKEUP.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.601
TRAGIC.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.237
TRAGIC IS LOADING
YOURSELF UP

10:04.304 --> 10:07.240
WITH SO MUCH MASCARA,
YOU CAN'T BLINK.

10:07.307 --> 10:11.444
***

10:11.511 --> 10:13.346
I CAN BLINK.

10:16.750 --> 10:20.153
(slow ripping sound)

10:20.220 --> 10:21.655
OW.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.627
I'M SORRY.
WAS THAT IN YOUR WAY?

10:27.695 --> 10:28.929
OH, I WASN'T SURE
IF IT WAS GONNA BE,

10:28.996 --> 10:30.931
BUT NOW IT'S FOR SURE NOT.
(chuckles)

10:32.299 --> 10:35.168
WOW. WHAT DO YOU NEED
ALL OF THIS FOR?

10:35.235 --> 10:37.370
I NEED ALL THIS...
FOR ALL THIS.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.072
(both chuckle)

10:39.139 --> 10:42.009
EXCEPT THIS.
I NEED THIS FOR...

10:42.075 --> 10:44.511
THIS.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.246
CORN?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.380
PRE-CORN.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.516
WELL, OKAY.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.718
WELL, YOU'RE ALL SET.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.054
I'M JUST GONNA GRAB SOME...

10:54.888 --> 10:56.089
WHAT ARE THESE?

10:56.156 --> 10:56.890
YOGA PANTS.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.625
OKAY. WHERE ARE MY THINGS?

10:58.692 --> 10:59.927
OH, YOU MEAN YOUR UNDIES?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.929
I MOVED 'EM SO I COULD FIT
MY YOGA PANTS.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.798
DALLAS, YOU DO NOT TOUCH
A-A MAN'S UNDIES

11:04.865 --> 11:07.234
UNLESS HE TELLS YOU
YOU CAN.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.736
WELL, YOU DIDN'T SAY
I COULDN'T.

11:08.802 --> 11:12.139
THERE ARE CERTAIN BOUNDARIES,
AND MY UNDIES--

11:12.205 --> 11:14.942
UNDERWEAR ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT BOUNDARY.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.676
(chuckles)
DON'T BE SILLY, GEORGE.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.878
I'M NOT BEING SILLY.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.446
OH.
(spritzes)

11:19.512 --> 11:20.781
AAH! WHAT IS THAT?

11:20.848 --> 11:22.549
IT'S LAVENDER.
IT PROMOTES A RESTFUL SLEEP.

11:22.615 --> 11:23.650
IT ALSO STINGS A LITTLE.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.618
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?
WHAT?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.088
YOU SHOULD GET SOME UNDERWEAR
LIKE THE SOCCER PLAYERS WEAR,

11:28.155 --> 11:31.058
LIKE, THE 3/4 BRIEF
LIKE BECKHAM,

11:31.124 --> 11:33.861
'CAUSE HONESTLY,
THESE ARE SO UNFLATTERING.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.695
I MEAN, BIG OLD DUMPY
BOXER SHORTS.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.430
NOBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU
IN THESE, GEORGE.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.799
GIVE ME THOSE!

11:38.866 --> 11:41.101
I DO NOT NEED NEW UNDERWEAR
OR LAVENDER SPRITZES.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.236
I ENJOY ANSWERING THE DOOR
DURING DINNER,

11:43.303 --> 11:45.138
AND QUITE FRANKLY,
NOTHING MAKES ME HAPPIER

11:45.205 --> 11:48.508
THAN EATING PIZZA
OFF A PAPER PLATE.

11:48.575 --> 11:52.445
OH, AND, DALLAS, FOR THE RECORD,
THAT AIN'T A PRE-CORN.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.982
THAT'S A FULL-BLOWN CORN.

11:55.048 --> 11:55.883
(gasps)

11:55.949 --> 11:57.484
I BELIEVE
IT WAS OPRAH WHO SAID--

11:57.550 --> 12:00.020
YOU SHUT UP.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.421
(slams)

12:01.488 --> 12:03.556
GEORGE RARELY SLAMMED DOORS.

12:03.623 --> 12:04.691
I TOOK THIS AS A GOOD SIGN.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.159
SOMETHING TOLD ME

12:06.226 --> 12:10.030
THE SITUATION WAS GOING
TO TAKE CARE OF ITSELF.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.702
MM. YOU CAN'T SIT WITH US.

12:15.769 --> 12:19.106
NO, THIS IS THE COOL TABLE.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.241
MM.

12:21.308 --> 12:25.712
UNREAL.
SHE EVEN SLEEPS LIKE A BITCH.

12:25.779 --> 12:30.083
(object clattering)

12:30.150 --> 12:32.953
(snoring)

12:52.172 --> 12:53.006
(gasps)

12:53.073 --> 12:54.207
(whispers)
SHH! SHH, SHH, SHH.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.675
(whispers) YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUT OF ME!

12:55.742 --> 12:58.211
GO BACK TO UPSTAIRS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
NO.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.147
(clatter)

13:05.185 --> 13:06.619
NO, NO, NO.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.856
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

13:12.759 --> 13:14.494
GIVE ME THE BAT.

13:24.838 --> 13:25.906
(clatter in distance)

13:25.973 --> 13:28.175
SHH!
BABY.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.415
(thud in distance)
(gasps)

13:41.388 --> 13:43.423
(thud)

13:43.490 --> 13:44.824
WE'RE FROM NEW YORK!

13:44.892 --> 13:46.159
AAH! (gasps)

13:46.226 --> 13:47.160
DALLAS!

13:47.227 --> 13:49.329
DROP YOUR CURTAIN ROD!
IT'S JUST ME.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.599
OKAY, GO--GO--GO--
GO BACK TO BED, SWEETHEART.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.001
SHOULD I BRING THEIR CAR AROUND?

13:54.067 --> 13:56.736
WHAT? N--GO.
JUST GO. PLEASE.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.572
DALLAS, WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN MY LAUNDRY ROOM,

13:59.639 --> 14:00.974
EATING A HAM AND CHEESE?

14:01.041 --> 14:02.976
THIS IS A CROQUE MONSIEUR.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.077
AT 3:30 IN THE MORNING?

14:04.144 --> 14:05.345
I'M AN EMOTIONAL EATER,

14:05.412 --> 14:06.980
AND I WAS FEELING
A LITTLE GUILTY.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.982
(sighs) FOR WHAT,
TOUCHING MY UNDERWEAR

14:09.049 --> 14:10.283
OR MACING ME WITH LAVENDER?

14:10.350 --> 14:12.185
WELL, I REALLY
PUT YOU ON THE SPOT

14:12.252 --> 14:14.387
WHEN DAHLIA AND I SHOWED UP
AT YOUR DOOR.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.524
AND YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT
TO THROW THAT HISSY FIT EARLIER.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.859
(chuckles) RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW
IF I'D CALL IT A HISSY FIT.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.128
YEAH, IT WAS.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.862
WELL, I GUESS I DID LOSE
MY COOL A LITTLE.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.731
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE I'VE...

14:24.797 --> 14:26.900
SHARED MY SPACE WITH ANYONE,
YOU KNOW?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.635
WELL,
IT'S HARD DOING IT ALONE.

14:28.701 --> 14:32.272
I MEAN, STEVEN TRAVELS SO MUCH,
HE'S GONE MORE THAN HE'S HERE.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.574
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
A SINGLE PARENT.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.445
SO A CROQUE MONSIEUR, HUH?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.981
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW. IT LOOKS
LIKE A HAM AND CHEESE TO ME.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.449
TO THE LAYMAN.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.184
(chuckles)

14:44.251 --> 14:45.518
(crunches)

14:45.585 --> 14:48.221
OOH, LA LA. (laughs)

14:48.288 --> 14:49.256
(laughs)

14:49.322 --> 14:51.124
DAHLIA AND I SURVIVED
THE NIGHT,

14:51.191 --> 14:52.559
BUT THE NEXT MORNING,

14:52.625 --> 14:54.962
WE WERE ANXIOUS TO PUT
OUR SLEEPOVER BEHIND US.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.965
WELL, I HATE UGLY GOOD-BYES,
BUT...

14:58.031 --> 14:59.066
GOOD-BYE, UGLY.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.900
(gasps)
AND... VOILA.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.202
(gasps)

15:02.269 --> 15:03.536
NEXT WEEKEND,
I'LL MAKE YOU FRENCH TOAST.

15:03.603 --> 15:04.704
NEXT WEEKEND?

15:04.771 --> 15:07.507
OH, NO. NEXT WEEKEND IS
THE APPLE FESTIVAL, RIGHT?

15:07.574 --> 15:09.042
OH, YEAH. I CAN'T WAIT.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.944
YOU REALLY THINK THE GIRLS
ARE GONNA LIKE IT, THOUGH?

15:11.011 --> 15:12.779
NO, THE GIRLS WON'T LIKE IT.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.182
OH, IT'S THE APPLE FESTIVAL.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.316
THEY HAVE A HAYRIDE
THAT TAKES YOU

15:16.383 --> 15:17.650
RIGHT TO THE CHOWDER FESTIVAL.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.986
(laughs) OH, REALLY? WOW.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.388
I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE
SO MANY FESTIVALS HERE.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.223
OH, YES, HONEY.
EVERY WEEKEND.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.558
OUR FAMILIES ARE GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.761
GEORGE LEFT ME
WITH NO OTHER CHOICE.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.364
I HAD TO PLAN MY ESCAPE.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.669
IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE
SOMEONE ELSE IN ON THE JOB--

15:36.736 --> 15:38.205
SOMEONE WITHOUT A MORAL CODE.

15:38.271 --> 15:41.074
HEY, DAHLIA, WAIT UP.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.678
TAKE A LAP.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.016
LOOK, YOU DON'T WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH ME,

15:49.082 --> 15:50.383
AND I DON'T WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH YOU--

15:50.450 --> 15:52.952
AND I DON'T WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH YOU, EITHER.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.887
RIGHT.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.189
SO I'VE GOT A PLAN.

15:56.256 --> 15:58.358
ARE YOU GONNA
FAKE A PREGNANCY?

15:58.425 --> 15:59.993
KENZIE FAKED A PREGNANCY
LAST YEAR

16:00.060 --> 16:01.528
TO GET OUT OF EARTH SCIENCE.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.629
NO, BUT...

16:02.695 --> 16:04.964
LET'S KEEP THAT IDEA
IN OUR BACK POCKET.

16:05.032 --> 16:06.966
SHE GOT A LOT OF
REALLY CUTE STUFF FOR THE BABY.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.335
SHE FAKED A GIRL.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.204
MY PLAN'S
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.740
IF GOOD BEHAVIOR COULDN'T
GET ME OUT EARLY,

16:13.806 --> 16:15.542
MAYBE BAD BEHAVIOR WOULD.

16:15.608 --> 16:16.543
(blows whistle)

16:16.609 --> 16:18.111
LISTEN, I TALKED
TO A FEW MORE NEIGHBORS

16:18.178 --> 16:19.612
ABOUT THE PANIC ROOM IDEA.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.248
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I APPRECIATE
YOU PUTTING THE WORD OUT,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.050
BUT I'VE BEEN SORT OF
RETHINKING THAT WHOLE THING.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.352
WELL, I WISH YOU WOULD'VE TOLD
ME BEFORE I PUT THE WORD OUT.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.988
(laughs) WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?
SUDDENLY YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY?

16:29.056 --> 16:30.657
MM... NO.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.425
I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF PEOPLE'S FEARS.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.894
LOOK, DENTISTRY--NO,
THE WHOLE MEDICAL INDUSTRY

16:34.961 --> 16:36.196
IS BASED ON FEAR.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.330
FEAR IS WHAT BOUGHT ME

16:37.397 --> 16:39.566
A SUMMER HOME
IN THE FINGER LAKES.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.600
(laughs)

16:40.667 --> 16:42.535
THESE PEOPLE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS,
YOU KNOW?

16:42.602 --> 16:44.271
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.872
ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE REASON
PEOPLE LIVE IN THE SUBURBS?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.774
THAT AND THE FESTIVALS.

16:47.840 --> 16:52.612
JAVIER, SEE IF THEY HAVE A DOZEN
OF THESE IN THE DOVE GRAY.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.749
JEREMY, I LOVE THOSE FRAMES.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.651
SO THE DOLLS ARE STILL GONE.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.986
UH-HUH.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.589
MY MOM'S A BASKET CASE.
SHE CAN'T SLEEP. SHE PACES.

17:02.655 --> 17:05.392
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
SO MISERABLE.
MM.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.700
WOULD YOU CALL THIS
A TORTOISE?

17:16.969 --> 17:18.371
DOLL THIEF!

17:18.438 --> 17:20.173
ME?

17:20.240 --> 17:23.476
I ACCUSE YOU, TESSA ALTMAN,

17:23.543 --> 17:26.413
OF STEALING
THAT WEIRD WOMAN'S DOLLS!

17:26.479 --> 17:29.015
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
RIGHT, TESSA?

17:29.082 --> 17:30.717
(students murmuring)

17:30.783 --> 17:35.088
YOU'RE ACCUSING ME OF BEING
THE NOTORIOUS CHATSWIN BURGLAR?

17:35.155 --> 17:37.457
(loudly)
DID YOU HEAR THAT, MR. WOLFE?

17:37.524 --> 17:40.193
GET TO CLASS, JEREMY.
(boy) YEAH, RIGHT.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.761
WHAT UP? WHAT'S GOING DOWN?

17:41.828 --> 17:45.932
TESSA STOLE THE DOLLS.
I KNOW FOR A FACT SHE DID IT.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.167
SHE BRAGGED ABOUT IT
LAST NIGHT

17:47.234 --> 17:49.369
WHEN I SLEPT OVER
IN HER TINY, GROSS ROOM.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.939
WHOA. THE LAST THING
ANYONE WANTS IS A GIRL FIGHT.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.108
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

17:55.175 --> 17:59.212
(chuckles) THERE IS NO WAY
MY DAUGHTER STOLE DOLLS.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.315
I UNDERSTAND HOW COMFORTING
DENIAL CAN BE.

18:02.382 --> 18:05.152
I OFTEN ENDORSE IT
FOR OUR OBESE STUDENTS.

18:05.218 --> 18:06.953
BUT IN THIS CASE,
SHE CONFESSED.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.255
WH--WHAT? WHAT?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.922
IT'S TRUE.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.124
I DID IT.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.860
YOU STOLE SHIRLEY TEMPLE DOLLS?
REALLY?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.362
YEAH.

18:15.428 --> 18:18.064
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

18:18.131 --> 18:20.099
MAYBE I'M BORED

18:20.167 --> 18:22.034
OR MAYBE
I'VE BEEN ACTING OUT.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.038
MAYBE THE SUBURBS AREN'T AS GOOD
FOR ME AS YOU THOUGHT THEY WERE.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.940
SHE WAS ALWAYS AN OUTSIDER.

18:28.007 --> 18:31.077
I WAS, AND I TRIED.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.146
I... I REALLY DID.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.483
BUT MAYBE...

18:36.549 --> 18:41.188
I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS JUST
ME SPITBALLING HERE, BUT...

18:41.254 --> 18:44.023
MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE BACK
TO NEW YORK,

18:44.090 --> 18:46.493
WHERE WE BELONG.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.395
WELL...

18:48.461 --> 18:50.163
IT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.232
BEST OF LUCK TO YOU, TESSA.

18:52.299 --> 18:55.402
YOU REALLY BRIGHTENED
THESE HALLWAYS.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.305
OH, AND ALL YEARBOOK PREORDERS
ARE NONREFUNDABLE.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.373
OUTSIDE COMPANY.
NOTHING I CAN DO.

19:01.874 --> 19:05.144
HAD I GOTTEN AWAY
WITH THE PERFECT CRIME,

19:05.212 --> 19:08.415
OR WAS I BEING PLAYED LIKE
A GAME OF "WORDS WITH FRIENDS"?

19:08.481 --> 19:10.049
WONDER IF I SHOULD
SWING BY THE POST OFFICE,

19:10.116 --> 19:11.451
PICK UP
A CHANGE OF ADDRESS FORM?

19:11.518 --> 19:13.186
YOU CAN DO THAT ONLINE.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.987
OH. THAT'LL MAKE IT EASY.

19:15.054 --> 19:18.325
LOOK AT THIS! PERFECT CRIME.

19:18.391 --> 19:22.329
YEAH, THERE'S JUST ONE THING
WE NEED TO DO FIRST.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.532
AW, "WORDS WITH FRIENDS"!

19:25.598 --> 19:27.600
(whirs)

19:38.578 --> 19:40.647
TINY OVERALLS.
HAND-STITCHED.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.815
BREAKS MY HEART.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.050
(sighs)

19:44.116 --> 19:46.219
MAYBE THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE
WHO CAN USE THEM.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.821
ANOTHER COLLECTOR OR...

19:48.888 --> 19:51.958
SOMEONE WITH A PET MONKEY.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.427
MAYBE A SMALL FARMER.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.230
TESSA, ISN'T THERE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY...

19:57.297 --> 19:58.598
TO SHEILA?

19:58.665 --> 20:00.800
OH, THIS REALLY DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE A GOOD TIME.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.001
OH, NO, PLEASE.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.637
I NEED TO FOCUS ON SOMETHING
OTHER THAN THE SHIRLEYS.

20:06.138 --> 20:08.541
WELL, IT'S ABOUT THE SHIRLEYS.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.442
I TOOK THEM.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.544
YOU TOOK MY GIRLS?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.380
TESSA.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.415
(voice breaks)
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING TO YOU,

20:15.482 --> 20:16.983
INJURED YOU IN SOME WAY?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.685
NO. IT'S NOT THAT.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.888
BECAUSE IF I HAVE,
I AM TRULY SORRY.

20:21.954 --> 20:25.525
BECAUSE I REALIZE NOW FOR YOU TO
DO SOMETHING SO WICKED TO ME,

20:25.592 --> 20:28.127
I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING
EVEN MORE WICKED TO YOU.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.228
(door opens)

20:29.296 --> 20:30.430
YOU DID, MOTHER...

20:30.497 --> 20:32.265
(door closes)
BUT NOT TO HER. TO ME.

20:32.332 --> 20:35.302
SO IF YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE,
I'M LISTENING.

20:36.703 --> 20:39.372
AFTER EVERYTHING
I HAVE DONE FOR YOU?!

20:39.439 --> 20:41.374
WHAT HAVE YOU--WH--
WHAT HAVE YOU EVER DONE FOR ME,

20:41.441 --> 20:43.443
EXCEPT CRUSH MY SPIRIT,
TAKE AWAY MY DESSERT,

20:43.510 --> 20:45.512
GIVE MY CAT UP
FOR ADOPTION?!

20:45.578 --> 20:47.647
(Sheila) MR. WHISKERS...
LISA DID THE CRIME,

20:47.714 --> 20:50.350
BUT SOMETHING TOLD ME I WAS
GOING TO SERVE THE TIME.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.453
SO WHEN DID YOU FIGURE ME OUT?
(Lisa) LOOK AT ALL THIS!
RYAN, RYAN, RYAN, RYAN,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.388
SHIRLEY, SHIRLEY, RYAN.
THE MOMENT YOU WERE BORN?

20:55.455 --> 20:57.089
WHERE THE HELL IS MY TUB?

20:57.156 --> 21:00.793
SO THERE'S, LIKE, ZERO CHANCE
WE'RE MOVING BACK TO NEW YORK?

21:00.860 --> 21:01.961
LESS THAN THAT.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.230
(sighs)
(Lisa) ...I NEED TO,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

21:04.297 --> 21:07.266
YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO PUNISH ME.

21:07.334 --> 21:10.269
IF I MISS OUT
ON THE CHOWDER FESTIVAL,

21:10.337 --> 21:11.938
IT IS MY OWN DAMN FAULT.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.272
WHICH PART OF
"FROM THE MOMENT YOU WERE BORN"

21:13.340 --> 21:14.307
DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

21:14.374 --> 21:15.842
ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS,

21:15.908 --> 21:19.011
IF MY BEDROOM SMELLED THAT BAD
AFTER DALIA ATE PIZZA,

21:19.078 --> 21:21.147
WHAT THE HELL WAS THE CAR RIDE
HOME FROM THE CHOWDER FESTIVAL

21:21.213 --> 21:23.450
GONNA BE LIKE?
