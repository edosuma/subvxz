00:26.726 --> 00:28.956
I think your father
is capable of anything.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.362
Two years ago, the Meade family
lost their eldest son.

00:32.432 --> 00:35.230
While he may have lost a son,
he gained a daughter.

00:35.301 --> 00:38.395
- Hi, Daddy. I'm back.
- Alex?

00:38.471 --> 00:41.463

01:29.355 --> 01:32.324
Your boss's brother

01:32.392 --> 01:34.155
No, that's a transvestite.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.855
- Alexis is a transsexual.
- What's the difference?

01:36.930 --> 01:40.798
Transsexuals have surgery to reassign
themselves to the opposite sex.

OK, let's just cut to it.
They soften the jaw. Slim the nose.

I'll spare you the more graphic details.

09:42.114 --> 09:45.948

12:24.210 --> 12:27.873
Unless you plan on standing
in front of a priest with this guy...

12:28.781 --> 12:31.409
...you need to let him go.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.180
OK, thank you for coming.
I have to get back to work.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.687
I was just concerned for you.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.157
And I was hoping to get a look
at the she-male.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.625
Dad!

12:50.636 --> 12:52.661
What are you doing here?

12:53.439 --> 12:56.033
Oh, my God! What happened to you?

12:56.108 --> 13:00.044
- School called me, he got into a fight.
- A fight? Why didn't they call me?

13:00.112 --> 13:02.637
He's my father.
They can call him if they want to.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.616
<i>Hey. Attitude. Ay, Dios mio.</i>

13:05.684 --> 13:08.847
- Who did this to you?
- I'm going to my room.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.357
Excuse me. Can I help you?

13:23.869 --> 13:25.894
- Who are you?
- I am Betty Suarez.

13:25.971 --> 13:30.032
- I am Daniel Meade's assistant.
- Claire Meade. Daniel Meade's mother.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.134
I win.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.806
Hello, Daniel.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.510
Mom? What are you doing here?

13:39.585 --> 13:42.349
Enjoying this glorious day.

13:42.421 --> 13:45.447
The sun is shining.
The air is crisp.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.856
Even the hobos have
a spring in their step.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.657
- Are you OK?
- Don't I seem OK?

13:51.130 --> 13:54.566
No. You seem... happy.

13:54.633 --> 13:57.727
You realize what happened
in the family the last three days?

13:57.803 --> 14:01.295
- Look what I bought your sister.
- You didn't just say that.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.467
With her boobs, she'll be
a knockout in this dress.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.341
This one comes in green.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.040
Which do you think is her color?

14:09.114 --> 14:12.641
Are you on pills? Do I need
to call a sponsor or something?

14:12.718 --> 14:15.050
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Mom, Dad is in prison.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.681
- You have not gone to see him yet!
- He won't be there for long.

14:18.757 --> 14:22.386
He didn't do this, you know.
Do you have plans for lunch?

14:22.461 --> 14:24.725
I want to take both my children out.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.527
Stop acting like it's Easter! OK?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.194
Your family is falling apart.
Do you realize that?

14:30.269 --> 14:33.636
My family is coming together.

14:33.706 --> 14:38.234
The child I buried and grieved over
for the last two years is alive.

14:38.310 --> 14:41.245
I don't care what
he came back as.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.948
I have him back.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.419
"Her."

14:51.891 --> 14:54.655
Cancel my appointments.
I'm taking my mother to a spa.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.627
- Why?
- I can't let her out of my sight.

14:56.695 --> 15:00.825
She's acting like she's
on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.768
- She looks fine to me.
- Her crazy works on this time delay.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.702
When Alex died,
she spent three days

15:06.772 --> 15:10.071
planning a party, during the main course
she excuses herself,

15:10.142 --> 15:13.373
goes upstairs,
swallows a bottle of pills.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.277
[Betty gasps] Um...

15:16.348 --> 15:18.714
- I can take your mother.
- What, really?

15:18.784 --> 15:21.116
You have these phone calls
and meetings...

15:21.186 --> 15:24.087
- I can't ask you to do that.
- Don't be silly, Daniel.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.386
Come on, Mrs. Meade,
we're going to the spa!

15:26.458 --> 15:29.859
- Goodie. A new babysitter.
- We'll take the stairs.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.625
- It'll get the toxins out.
- I like my toxins...

15:33.165 --> 15:34.723
...with two olives.

15:36.902 --> 15:39.928
Excuse me, was that blur
running for the fire exit Betty?

15:40.005 --> 15:42.940
- I wanted to take her to lunch.
- That's actually my fault.

15:43.008 --> 15:45.943
I sent her on a special errand.
It's been a crazy day.

15:46.011 --> 15:49.105
Oh. Because I have a coupon
for the baked potato bar.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.940
It's for two.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.077
Sorry. I had a potato for breakfast.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.955
[Claire] It's ridiculous. One DUI,

16:06.031 --> 16:08.898
O.D. A couple of times,

16:08.968 --> 16:10.936
show up naked at a garden party,

16:11.003 --> 16:12.595
and suddenly...

16:12.671 --> 16:14.935
...everyone treats you like a child.

16:15.007 --> 16:17.237
He wants to be sure
you can't hurt yourself.

16:17.309 --> 16:20.301
If I wanted to drink this,
what could you do to stop me?

16:22.748 --> 16:25.945
- Not bad.
- So, do you go to spas often?

16:26.018 --> 16:29.419
Oh... hello.
I'm guessing "yes."

16:29.488 --> 16:33.584
This is my first time at the spa.
I'm actually really excited to be here.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.594
My boyfriend surprised me at work,
it's a lousy surprise.

16:36.662 --> 16:40.154
I have to break up with him,
I've never broken up with anyone before.

16:40.232 --> 16:44.100
- I'm a green girl...
- Betty. I'm in the tub.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.729
- You can stop babbling.
- OK.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.491
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Evelyn.

17:10.561 --> 17:14.623
Your cleaning lady for 13 years.
It's nice to meet you.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.602
Nice to put a face with the burrito
wrapper you left on my counter.

17:18.871 --> 17:22.238
So, what are you doing home
in the middle of the afternoon?

17:22.307 --> 17:25.140
I thought you were
the editor-in-chief.

17:25.210 --> 17:29.874
- How did you know that?
- I snooped. I saw your business cards.

17:29.948 --> 17:32.416
- I'm taking the afternoon off.
- Oh, please.

17:32.484 --> 17:35.282
Women like us don't take
no afternoons off.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.982
Our careers always come first.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.925
Well, maybe women like us

17:41.994 --> 17:44.428
need to learn there's more to life

17:44.496 --> 17:46.794
than work... Evelyn.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.134
Caviar?

17:55.174 --> 17:57.108
He still won't tell me what happened.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.077
He showed up to school twirling a flag.
What do you think?

18:00.145 --> 18:04.582
<i>Look at this. Ice skating lessons,
jazzercise, Music Man auditions...</i>

18:04.650 --> 18:07.585
I know, I know, it's my fault
for letting him be who he is.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.349
I bought him unicorn stickers
when he was three.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.084
Go ahead, make jokes,
but now he's getting beat up.

18:13.158 --> 18:16.093
- It's time for us to get practical.
- "Us"?

18:16.161 --> 18:18.459
There hasn't been an "us" with Justin

18:18.530 --> 18:20.794
since the back seat
of your rented Camaro.

18:20.866 --> 18:24.063
Uh-uh. You can leave now.
I will handle this.

18:24.136 --> 18:27.970
Whether you like it or not, he asked me
to pick him up from school today.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.837
You got a beer?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.256
<i>[La Cucaracha ringtone on cellphone]</i>

18:48.327 --> 18:52.457
I didn't pass out in
a Mexican whorehouse again, did I?

18:52.531 --> 18:57.093
No, but could you check my phone for me?

18:57.169 --> 18:59.399
It could be Daniel.

19:02.241 --> 19:03.799
And there's the back part.

19:09.748 --> 19:12.114
A guy with no chin
and permanent bed-head.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.049
Oh, that's Walter, my boyfriend.

19:14.119 --> 19:16.815
He says he has a big surprise for you.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.414
And then a smiley face.

19:19.491 --> 19:23.655
Yeah, he does that. He also makes
a clown face out of the "a" in Walter.

19:23.929 --> 19:26.762
<i>- Hot.
- [cell phone rings again]</i>

19:26.832 --> 19:30.199
This guy is a pain in the ass.
Break up with him already.

19:30.269 --> 19:33.329
It's not that easy.
He loves me.

19:33.405 --> 19:37.102
Well, according to his
latest message, he "wuvs" you.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.471
Why are you holding onto him?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.876
- I'll stand up again.
- OK, OK.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.276
Before my mother died,

19:49.755 --> 19:51.950
she told me the most
important thing in life

19:52.024 --> 19:54.515
is to find someone who loves you.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.658
And when you do,

19:57.729 --> 19:59.959
hold onto them no matter what.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.163
Because in the end,
that's all that matters.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.965
Honey, if your mother were still here,

20:06.038 --> 20:09.701
all she'd want to know
is that you're happy...

20:09.775 --> 20:12.938
...and you're not happy right now.

20:14.680 --> 20:16.773
I gotta pee.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.752
[Alexis] Thank you all for coming.

20:22.821 --> 20:25.847
I'm sure by now you've all
heard about the injunction.

20:25.924 --> 20:29.155
I can assure you it's
nothing more than a stalling tactic.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.493
Within a week, I will assume
control of Meade Publications.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.032
Actually, that's not true.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.624
[Sighs]

20:36.702 --> 20:38.863
My brother Danny, everyone.

20:38.937 --> 20:42.737
You probably remember him from his
recent humiliation by Sofia Reyes.

20:42.808 --> 20:47.245
When it comes to family humiliations,
I'll definitely take mine over yours.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.372
Oh, and Alex, it's Daniel.

20:50.449 --> 20:53.907
OK, well, this has been fun, Danny,
but if you have more to say,

20:53.986 --> 20:56.614
I suggest you call
your own press conference.

20:56.688 --> 21:01.489
Under my leadership, Meade Publications
will become a force in new media also.

21:01.560 --> 21:05.257
I have a four-point plan
for making us a major player in...

21:06.398 --> 21:08.093
What are you doing?

21:08.166 --> 21:10.896
I'm calling my own
press conference... right now.

21:10.969 --> 21:14.769
And any of you who come over to mine
gets to see a photo of Alexis

21:14.840 --> 21:16.865
with a whole lot of chest hair.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.441
[Daniel laughing]

21:20.512 --> 21:21.945
And at our cottage,

21:22.014 --> 21:25.506
Alex would drag
Daniel out on the lake,

21:25.584 --> 21:29.247
push him out of the boat,
and make him swim back to shore.

21:30.422 --> 21:33.050
Did I mention this was January?

21:33.125 --> 21:36.754
- He lost a pinky toe.
- Daniel only has nine toes?

21:38.230 --> 21:42.326
No matter what torture Alex concocted,
Daniel always looked up to him.

21:42.401 --> 21:44.460
His big brother could do no wrong.

21:44.536 --> 21:45.798
Could I get a spritz?

21:45.871 --> 21:48.101
- Ow. Ow!
- [Cracking]

21:48.173 --> 21:50.641
OK, I chose all wrong.

21:50.709 --> 21:53.269
So, tell me. How bad is it
between them?

21:53.345 --> 21:55.870
They're, you know...

21:55.947 --> 21:57.744
They're adjusting.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.307
- Betty.
- It's like Cain and Abel...

22:00.919 --> 22:03.513
...if Abel was a woman,
who used to be a man.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.988
Ah... ah... ow!

22:06.058 --> 22:07.616
Believe it or not,

22:07.693 --> 22:10.628
there was actually a time
when we were a real family.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.628
Every birthday, the kids
would drag us to Coney Island.

22:15.934 --> 22:20.564
I always hoped they'd want to do
something more civilized like...

22:20.639 --> 22:22.004
...a nice pheasant hunt.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.376
Now I would kill for
bumper cars and corn dogs.

22:27.979 --> 22:30.743
It might not be too late to fix this.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.478
There's one thing
that they have in common:

22:33.552 --> 22:36.077
They both really care about you.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.020
<i>[Speaking Spanish]</i>

22:46.031 --> 22:48.966
OK, so you see that stripper?
She used to be a nun,

22:49.034 --> 22:51.332
and she's pregnant
with the butcher's baby.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.634
But, she doesn't know that
the butcher is her second cousin.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.402
Story as old as time.

22:58.243 --> 23:00.677
How many boyfriends do I get?

23:00.746 --> 23:02.976
<i>- One, two, three...

23:04.015 --> 23:05.710
Wilhelmina Slater's office.

23:05.784 --> 23:09.845
I'm in hell. Where are we in putting the
book together? We'll make the deadline?

23:09.921 --> 23:11.320
I thought you didn't care.

23:11.390 --> 23:14.826
<i>That was before I had to watch
Mork & Mindy in Spanish.</i>

23:14.893 --> 23:17.760
I want to know every detail
that's going on down there.

23:17.829 --> 23:20.093
Why don't you just come down here?

23:20.165 --> 23:23.999
I can't just stroll back in.
I made a dramatic exit.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.003
But I can be there

23:26.071 --> 23:29.563
without... actually "being there."

23:30.175 --> 23:32.268
That makes sense.

23:32.344 --> 23:35.074
Now listen, take the orchid
on your desk,

23:35.147 --> 23:38.810
turn it slowly clockwise
until I tell you to stop.

with water or anything, is it?

23:59.004 --> 24:02.167
<i>There will be extensive changes

Naturally, people who aren't in power
can't make changes, can they?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.538
And people who are just playing
editor-in-chief

24:08.613 --> 24:11.707
should go back to throwing a football
and whoring around.

to someone who wet his bed...

24:16.721 --> 24:19.212

24:19.291 --> 24:23.125
No, you shut up! Oh, that's not fair.
I can't hit a girl, can I?

24:23.195 --> 24:26.221

At the spa she kept saying that she
wanted to go back to happier times,

like when you were younger.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.749
Is there anywhere special
you used to go?

25:24.523 --> 25:28.357
Well, she used to like taking us
to clothing museums.

25:28.426 --> 25:32.328
Those were stores. She called them
"museums" to get us out of school.

25:32.397 --> 25:33.887
OK, guys. Think.

25:33.965 --> 25:35.728
Happy times... like, say,

25:35.800 --> 25:39.258
where you used to go
for your birthdays.

25:41.172 --> 25:43.003
- Coney Island.
- Every year.

25:43.074 --> 25:47.636
- You think that's where she is?
- Maybe. Do you really think...?

25:47.712 --> 25:51.148
Yes! God, you're so bad at this!
Let's go.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.377
<i>[Annie: Tomorrow plays on stereo]</i>

25:53.451 --> 25:56.750
Justin! Will you please come down here?

26:01.860 --> 26:04.920
Something tells me he won't
knock somebody up on prom night.

26:04.996 --> 26:07.521
- What are you still doing here?
- Oh, nothing.

26:07.599 --> 26:10.932
Just watching you let our son
"be who he wants to be."

26:11.002 --> 26:13.061
Fine, Santos, fine. I give up.

26:13.138 --> 26:15.936
I will let him be
who you want him to be, OK?

26:16.007 --> 26:19.568
And I will take away
everything that he loves.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.737
There. That's his life.

26:21.813 --> 26:23.405
A dentist appointment.

26:23.481 --> 26:26.143
- At least he'll still have teeth.
- [Doorbell rings]

26:26.217 --> 26:28.879
Hilda, I'm telling you,
we're being good parents.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.115
- We're protecting him.
- Stop!

26:31.189 --> 26:33.350
- [Knocking on door]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:37.729 --> 26:41.529
- You must be the mother.
- Is there a problem?

26:41.600 --> 26:45.058
I'll say. Your kid beat up my Bobby.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.698
So how long you been spying on me?

26:50.775 --> 26:53.369
You don't have an orchid
in the stairwell, do you?

26:53.445 --> 26:54.810
Don't worry, dear.

26:54.879 --> 26:58.508
I don't find you nearly as interesting
as you find yourself.

26:58.583 --> 26:59.709
Ooh.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.843
Wait. Back up.

27:03.088 --> 27:04.885
<i>Turn around.</i>

27:06.291 --> 27:09.590
Stop. Is that a party?

27:09.661 --> 27:10.650
Uh...

27:10.729 --> 27:12.788
Are you people
celebrating a birthday?

27:12.864 --> 27:15.992
Joelle in Styles turned 30.
We had to do something to help.

27:16.067 --> 27:20.731
Birthdays are the gateway to
Secret Santas and casual Fridays.

27:20.805 --> 27:24.138
<i>Take me to Daniel's office.
Maybe he's actually doing some work.</i>

27:24.209 --> 27:27.508
Ding dong, the witch is gone.
We can finally have cake!

27:28.413 --> 27:31.382
It was for your own good,
you dump truck!

27:37.389 --> 27:39.254
<i>- Where is Daniel?
- I don't know.</i>

27:39.324 --> 27:41.656
This is ridiculous.
Take me to Alexis.

27:41.726 --> 27:44.286
<i>- Actually, she left about an hour ago.
- What?</i>

27:44.362 --> 27:47.798
There's a 3:00 at Layouts
to nail down the center spread!

27:47.866 --> 27:50.027
Who the hell is running this magazine?

27:51.269 --> 27:52.827
<i>I don't know.</i>

27:59.210 --> 28:01.542
- There she is! Mom!
- I want a ride, Mom!

28:01.613 --> 28:03.513
Stay away from the crazy lady!

28:03.581 --> 28:05.879
- [Daniel] Mom!
- [Alexis] Get out of the car!

28:05.950 --> 28:08.418
- Make me!
- What's she doing?

28:08.486 --> 28:10.613
I think she wants you
to go and get her.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.850
Oh, you've got to be kidding.

28:16.061 --> 28:19.519
Come on, Mom. If you get out,
we can all go to a clothing museum.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.065
Seriously, you are such an idiot.

28:27.505 --> 28:29.370
Well...

28:29.974 --> 28:31.805
...talk to each other.

28:35.613 --> 28:38.104
- Wait, you did this on purpose?
- You think?

28:38.183 --> 28:40.981
- Damn it, we're adults.
- You can't manipulate us.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.179
- I'm leaving.
- Not so fast.

28:43.788 --> 28:46.689
You two aren't going anywhere
until you start talking.

28:46.758 --> 28:48.487
You too, missy.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.324
- Hey!
- I can do this all night long.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.626
Go ahead. Start talking.

28:58.870 --> 29:01.634
Yes, we're all very glad
you could fill the position.

29:01.706 --> 29:04.539
Get Layout in my office right now,
we have a 3:00.

29:04.609 --> 29:05.974
What are you doing here?

29:06.044 --> 29:08.638
Well, just because
I don't have the title yet,

29:08.713 --> 29:10.840
doesn't mean I'll let
a bad issue go out.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.042
I get it. Daniel and Alexis are away,

29:13.118 --> 29:16.417
so you can make a dramatic entrance
and then be the big hero.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.452
Believe it or not, Marc,

29:19.524 --> 29:21.719
it's not always about me.

29:23.361 --> 29:26.057
Are you people faxing resumes?

29:26.131 --> 29:27.655
No.

29:29.634 --> 29:30.931
Now, listen up.

29:31.002 --> 29:34.438
It's time we stop worrying about
the future, focus on the present.

29:34.506 --> 29:38.772
<i>Mode magazine did not become number
one by honoring people's personal lives.</i>

29:38.843 --> 29:40.902
So, I hope you all enjoyed the cake,

29:40.979 --> 29:42.879
because it'll be your last meal

29:42.947 --> 29:46.212
until the swimsuit issue
is up to our standards.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.512
Amen!

29:55.693 --> 29:57.490
Bobby says...

29:57.562 --> 29:59.655
...that Justin started it.

29:59.731 --> 30:03.292
He pulled his hair and scratched him.

30:03.368 --> 30:07.168
- Show him the marks, Bobby.
- Oh, no. That's OK, Bobby.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.604
There is no way that
Justin would do that.

30:09.674 --> 30:12.438
- Not unless he was provoked.
- And maybe not even then.

30:13.378 --> 30:16.677
- What did Bobby do to you?
- Nothing to deserve this.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.216
So what if he
called you a "Slut Mom"?

30:19.284 --> 30:22.344
- I'm sure he's not the first.
- He called me that?

30:22.420 --> 30:25.446
- What kind of kid talks like that?
- Can you blame him?

30:25.523 --> 30:27.252
Look at her.

30:28.726 --> 30:30.660
- Eyes up, Bobby!
- And you know what?

30:30.728 --> 30:34.357
It's time for you to go, the boys stay
away from each other. End of story.

30:35.066 --> 30:37.899
You know, you're a mother.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.766
Why don't you try looking like it?

30:39.838 --> 30:43.330
Yeah? You're a woman.
Why don't you try looking like that?

30:43.408 --> 30:44.807
Snap!

30:56.855 --> 30:59.346
Mom, are you mad at me?

31:00.158 --> 31:02.558
No. Oh, my God, no, honey.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.221
Yeah. Why would she be mad at you?

31:05.897 --> 31:08.388
You defended your mother.
I'm proud of you.

31:08.466 --> 31:12.300
But we're gonna have to talk about
that scratching and hair-pulling.

31:12.370 --> 31:16.238
For two years, you put us through hell,
Alex! We thought you were dead!

31:16.307 --> 31:19.367
Why couldn't you talk to me
about what you're going through?

31:19.444 --> 31:23.380
I needed a new life. We're not all born
into the life we're supposed to have.

31:23.448 --> 31:25.177
Well, we all got new lives...

31:25.250 --> 31:27.150
...full of grief and rehab.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.550
I never thought I'd see
any of you again!

31:29.621 --> 31:32.488
Then Fey died, and I had
a chance to get back at Dad.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.424
Get back at Dad for what?

31:35.493 --> 31:38.587
- Worshipping you too much?
- He wasn't worshipping!

31:38.663 --> 31:40.358
Oh, come on, Alex.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.491
You were the golden child.
Dad did everything with you.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.662
Boy Scouts, football games...

31:46.738 --> 31:48.933
Daniel, he figured it out.

31:50.108 --> 31:53.441
He hoped tossing a ball around
would change things.

31:53.511 --> 31:55.445
When I told him
I was gonna do this...

31:55.513 --> 31:57.708
You actually told him?

31:58.917 --> 32:02.648
He said if I went through with
the surgery, I'd lose everything.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.449
The company, the money...

32:05.390 --> 32:07.620
...our family.

32:07.692 --> 32:11.594
And then, just to make sure
I got the message loud and clear...

32:14.032 --> 32:16.398
...he said he'd rather I were dead.

32:19.170 --> 32:23.470
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because you're just like Dad.

32:25.176 --> 32:27.736
I didn't want to be rejected twice.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.782
This isn't nearly as fun
as it used to be.

32:42.427 --> 32:44.793
I guess this was a mistake.

33:04.482 --> 33:07.042
How could he say I'm like my father?

33:07.118 --> 33:09.951
I am nothing like my father.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.784
It's been a long time.

33:11.856 --> 33:15.724
People change. Maybe he just
doesn't know who you are anymore.

33:15.793 --> 33:18.193
- I would have been there for him.
- Of course.

33:18.262 --> 33:20.822
He's your bigger brother... kind of.

33:20.898 --> 33:23.594
And it's not too late
to prove to her

33:23.668 --> 33:26.159
that you're going
to be there for him... her.

33:26.237 --> 33:29.536
Can we pick a pronoun
and stick to it, please?

33:36.748 --> 33:38.238
Oh, God.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.375
Guess he's still waiting for that lunch.

33:41.452 --> 33:42.885
Yeah.

33:44.288 --> 33:47.519
We went to Coney Island and
forgot hot dogs. We should go back.

33:47.592 --> 33:50.322
Betty, trust me,

33:50.395 --> 33:53.853
it's a lot harder avoiding people
than facing them.

33:56.334 --> 33:57.892
Yeah.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.076
Hey.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.713
I'm sorry I'm late.

34:13.784 --> 34:17.585
I know most of our conversations
seem to start like that lately.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.485
Or...

34:19.556 --> 34:21.491
..."sorry I can't make it," or...

34:22.659 --> 34:25.561
..."sorry I snapped at you again..."
- It's OK.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.621
No.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.393
Walter, it's not OK.

34:31.502 --> 34:34.902
Look, Walter, you've...

34:34.972 --> 34:37.735
...meant so much to me.

34:37.809 --> 34:41.005
I don't know how to tell you how
much you've meant to me, but...

34:47.819 --> 34:48.945
What was that?

34:49.020 --> 34:51.284
<i>[The Manhattans:
Kiss and Say Good-bye]</i>

34:51.355 --> 34:54.620
I wanted one last kiss
before we ended this.

34:56.159 --> 34:59.823
I'm not stupid. I've known
for a while where this was going.

35:00.965 --> 35:04.662
I guess I just kept hoping that...

35:07.472 --> 35:11.203
- I'm so sorry.
- I took the job in Maryland.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.802
I'm gonna miss you.

35:16.247 --> 35:17.908
I know you won't believe me...

35:19.750 --> 35:22.014
...but I'm really gonna miss you, too.

36:04.595 --> 36:07.086
- [Charlie] Hey, Henry!
- Oh, my God.

36:09.534 --> 36:11.968
What are you doing here?

36:25.483 --> 36:27.576
Good morning, Aunt Betty.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.479
Mom?

36:31.556 --> 36:34.457
- Come on, I'm driving you to school.
- Looking like that?

36:34.525 --> 36:36.618
What? I'm trying something new.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.787
I think it's cute in a...

36:38.863 --> 36:42.560
...l- have-no-social-life kind of way.
- It's hideous. And so not you.

36:42.633 --> 36:44.658
Hey, I'm supposed to be a "mom."

36:44.735 --> 36:46.600
You are a mom!

36:46.671 --> 36:50.630
The mom that always tells me to be who I
am and not care what other people think!

36:50.708 --> 36:52.505
Don't you have to do that, too?

36:54.512 --> 36:57.072
So, you really don't care how I dress?

36:57.148 --> 36:59.981
Well, I'm not crazy
about the animal prints,

37:00.051 --> 37:02.076
you're a little over-accessorized,

37:02.153 --> 37:04.519
but you have your own style.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.079
It's cool.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.218
Well, God bless you,
because this was beginning to itch.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.598
All right, but to drive you to school,
I'll wear a jacket.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.759
Fine, just as long as I get to pick it.

37:31.282 --> 37:35.082
Morning. I need you to take my credit
card over to my mom at the Four Seasons.

37:35.152 --> 37:39.418
Apparently she went overboard yesterday,
wore out the magnetic strip.

37:39.490 --> 37:41.617
- Do you want me to go now?
- Be a good idea.

37:41.692 --> 37:44.923
- She's buying breakfast with bracelets.
- I'll go right now.

37:49.133 --> 37:50.327
- Hey.
- Hi!

37:50.401 --> 37:53.199
<i>- I have the Wicked tickets.
- Oh, my God. Henry,</i>

37:53.271 --> 37:55.262
you have no idea how excited I am.

37:55.339 --> 37:58.604
I'm driving my family crazy
singing the songs, except Justin.

37:58.676 --> 38:01.270
He's happy to have somebody
to sing the duets with.

38:01.345 --> 38:03.438
You gave me both of them.

38:03.514 --> 38:07.610
Listen... last night,
a friend from home showed up.

38:08.819 --> 38:10.650
My ex-girlfriend.

38:10.921 --> 38:12.479
Look, Betty...

38:13.391 --> 38:15.655
...I went back for Christmas,

38:15.726 --> 38:17.751
we saw each other,

38:17.828 --> 38:21.491
and it kind of started
to feel like old times.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.858
She came here to try and make it work.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.168
And, you're with Walter.

38:30.574 --> 38:32.565
Wow. That's...

38:34.745 --> 38:36.372
Wow. Um...

38:36.447 --> 38:39.211
So, you and Walter can go to the show.

38:41.485 --> 38:45.353
- Have fun.
- Yeah. Yeah, we will.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.680
Not our finest moment.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.514
Probably won't be in
the Meade family Christmas card.

39:18.556 --> 39:21.684
So... where do we stand?

39:22.626 --> 39:24.423
Look...

39:24.495 --> 39:28.261
...no matter how this turns out,
this is still a family company.

39:30.868 --> 39:34.804
Maybe it wouldn't kill us
to try and work together.

39:44.415 --> 39:45.882
I'm up for it.

39:47.418 --> 39:50.216
As long as you stop
staring at my boobs.

39:50.287 --> 39:52.812
I'm actually staring
at your Adam's apple.

39:54.492 --> 39:56.323
It's nice work.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.401
What show is this?

40:14.111 --> 40:16.773
<i>It's called Wilhelmina Got Screwed.</i>

40:17.982 --> 40:19.643
Oh.

40:20.518 --> 40:21.849
[Knocking on door]

40:26.123 --> 40:27.681
You're not room service.

40:27.758 --> 40:31.091
No, but Daniel asked me
to bring you this credit card.

40:31.162 --> 40:35.599
Oh, he's a good boy.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.028
Wait...

40:41.338 --> 40:44.034
...he's the one
who's still a boy, right?

40:44.108 --> 40:45.439
Mm-hmm.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.639
Would you like a Bloody Mary?

40:48.712 --> 40:52.307
- No, it's 10:00 in the morning.
- You're right.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.817
I should move on to martinis.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.252
So, why are you
staying in a hotel room?

41:01.058 --> 41:03.151
My house is empty.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.722
A house is not supposed to be empty.

41:08.532 --> 41:10.591
Well, that's just temporary, right?

41:10.668 --> 41:13.432
I mean, your husband will be out soon.

41:13.971 --> 41:17.236
Maybe. Maybe not.

41:18.175 --> 41:19.802
Mr. Meade is not a murderer.

41:19.877 --> 41:22.141
- I know.
- Good.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.012
I know...

41:25.082 --> 41:28.882
...because I know
who killed Fey Sommers.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.582
And it wasn't Bradford.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.025
It was me.

41:38.095 --> 41:39.562
