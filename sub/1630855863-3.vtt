WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.960
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.640 --> 00:13.480
Run.

00:17.880 --> 00:19.080
Run, Assane!

00:21.840 --> 00:23.160
Where is he?

00:23.880 --> 00:24.720
Guys!

00:36.560 --> 00:38.360
Are you OK? Did they hurt you?

00:38.440 --> 00:40.520
-Who were they?
-Answer me, please.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.840
I'm fine. Dad was awesome.

00:42.920 --> 00:43.760
No.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.600
-No, I can't let you say that.
-Why?

00:46.680 --> 00:47.640
You can see why.

00:48.720 --> 00:49.760
He's dangerous.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.040
-He uses others. He stops at nothing.
-Not true.

00:53.120 --> 00:53.960
It is!

00:54.880 --> 00:56.000
It's all his fault!

00:57.320 --> 00:59.760
I don't want to hear about him anymore!
Understand?

01:01.760 --> 01:04.080
I don't want him to come near us again.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.320
Do you understand?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.960
He's never kept a promise.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.480
We can't trust him anymore.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.600
This is the last time
he puts you in danger.

01:23.680 --> 01:27.680
You're in a great mood today.
What's going on?

01:27.760 --> 01:29.360
Can't believe she's not answering.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.200
-She's his mother.
-And I'm his father.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.040
I haven't spoken to the kid in a week.

01:35.600 --> 01:37.880
She was desperate. That's normal.

01:37.960 --> 01:38.800
No, it's not.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.720
She ratted me out to Pellegrini.
She went too far.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.920
Stop it. She had no choice.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.080
She warned you. She didn't give you up.

01:47.160 --> 01:49.080
Good thing you're here to cheer me up.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.800
You're my best friend.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.760
Comfort me. Don't tell me the truth.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.560
Buddy, you should be taking it out
on Pellegrini.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.640
So, what's the plan now?

02:06.560 --> 02:07.400
Assane?

02:09.200 --> 02:10.040
Don't worry.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.840
Pellegrini went after my son.
I'll do the same.

02:16.360 --> 02:17.560
We've got work to do.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.080
Thanks.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.880
-Hello?
-Hello?

02:30.960 --> 02:31.800
Ganimard?

02:32.880 --> 02:35.960
Listen. Monday, 10:00 a.m.
Café Paul, Place Dauphine.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.280
Be there. You got it?

02:38.040 --> 02:39.960
-I got it.
-And come alone.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.920
-OK.
-Alone, Ganimard.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.040
I'll find out if you talk.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.240
-Bet you will.
-By the way…

02:47.000 --> 02:48.680
-Try cold water.
-Cold water?

02:49.200 --> 02:51.680
The stain. It'll come out with cold water.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.840
Here we go. Bets are open. Come on!

03:05.920 --> 03:07.440
Where's the ball?

03:07.520 --> 03:08.960
You can see the ball.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.520
We're taking bets.
Doubling, tripling them.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.000
-Where is it?
-Left.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.080
There.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.360
-Sure?
-Positive.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.960
You win, sir.

03:17.760 --> 03:19.320
-Thanks.
-We should've bet.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.840
Round two. Come on, sir. The ball's here.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.600
Come on. We're taking bets.

03:23.680 --> 03:24.760
-Here?
-Yeah.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.760
-Sure?
-Sure.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.320
You've lost, sir.

03:29.560 --> 03:31.400
-Too bad.
-Next time.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.280
Can you see the ball?

03:33.360 --> 03:34.720
Round three.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.480
-So, how much?
-950.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.040
-We did good work today.
-Yeah.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.000
-Pretty girls.
-We're not so bad ourselves.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.920
-Sorry.
-Assane?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.280
How are you?

03:53.360 --> 03:54.200
Good.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.640
-Juliette, you coming?
-Coming.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.160
-What are you doing here?
-I was just thinking about you.

04:01.840 --> 04:02.720
What's the holdup?

04:03.880 --> 04:05.400
Meet me here tomorrow?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.280
Yeah. Totally.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.280
See you tomorrow, then.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.280
See you.

04:11.960 --> 04:12.800
OK.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.840
You don't waste any time.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.360
A complicated story.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.160
-I'll explain later.
-Who's that girl? You know her?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.160
What are you doing here?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.080
Stop pretending.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.520
Pretending what?

05:16.040 --> 05:18.640
You expect me to believe
this is all a coincidence?

05:19.840 --> 05:21.440
What's the catch this time?

05:23.400 --> 05:25.600
The waiter is your father's security?

05:27.000 --> 05:27.880
Sir?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.120
May I take your coat?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.200
I'm not staying.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.120
Very well.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.880
Security agents aren't
what they used to be.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.440
I'm serious, Juliette.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.760
This is going too far.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.400
What is this about?

05:46.520 --> 05:47.480
-Sure.
-Listen…

05:48.760 --> 05:51.320
It's never been simple
between our families.

05:52.640 --> 05:53.960
But we're not our fathers.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.480
That was between them. Not us.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.120
It's poisoning our relationship.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.600
There's no catch.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.360
You don't look well.
I'm trying to take your mind off things.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.480
Don't feel like you have to stay.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.560
That said, the food here is good.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.480
Madam?

06:21.000 --> 06:23.440
-Would you like to order?
-Salmon, please.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.600
Sir?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.360
-I'll have the same.
-Very well.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.480
-Yes?
-Your appointment is here, sir.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.600
Philippe Courbet.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.200
-Hello, Philippe.
-Sir.

06:49.680 --> 06:50.720
Come in.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.720
-Whiskey?
-No, thank you.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.560
Some wine, perhaps?

06:55.640 --> 06:58.200
Not what I'm here for.
Let's get straight to it.

06:58.840 --> 06:59.680
Have a seat.

07:02.880 --> 07:03.720
So…

07:05.200 --> 07:06.080
Tell me.

07:07.080 --> 07:07.960
Very well.

07:08.040 --> 07:12.320
I've checked the financial situation
of those attending the foundation's gala.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.200
Assuming that
30% of the attendees won't donate…

07:15.840 --> 07:19.120
Presuming that donors are less generous
than they say,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.280
we can expect 10 million euros.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.120
As you requested,
15% will go to the foundation.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.800
-The remaining 85%--
-Will go directly to me.

07:30.840 --> 07:34.000
The money will be transferred
to an offshore account.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.680
I just need a few days with my team
to finalize the contracts.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.720
How old are you?

07:43.280 --> 07:44.360
How old are you?

07:46.520 --> 07:48.560
My age is of no importance, sir.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.920
All that matters is
that I charge 10,000 euros an hour.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.440
It's expensive,

07:54.520 --> 07:56.840
but my clients get their money's worth.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.280
They say you're the best.

08:01.000 --> 08:01.840
So they say.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.640
-I have one question.
-Tell me.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.920
Is your daughter a part of this scam?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.480
-Let's not use that word.
-Yes, of course.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.800
Is Juliette Pellegrini involved
in all this?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.040
No, she isn't.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.360
Do you often dine alone?

08:25.240 --> 08:27.200
No, I was stood up.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.200
Was it a date?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.880
I was supposed to meet

08:32.800 --> 08:34.920
a Canadian donor for the foundation.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.000
And, well, he canceled.

08:37.840 --> 08:39.840
Rich people love being philanthropists.

08:41.160 --> 08:44.000
When it's about signing a check,
no one shows up.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.080
Do you donate?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.240
A lot more than you think, yes.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.240
Don't worry, I've got plenty left.

08:53.080 --> 08:54.760
-Too much, in fact.
-Stop it.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.560
Money can't buy happiness. Is that it?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.760
No,
but let's say my life has become serious.

09:02.560 --> 09:03.400
And…

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
there's no adrenaline left.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.520
-Do you miss it?
-Yes.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.160
Look at us now.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.680
Hiding behind our wine glasses.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.200
We'd never come to a place like this.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.800
We would have.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.920
We'd have left without paying.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.360
-Should we?
-You're crazy.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.560
You can't improvise that.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.560
-See? That's what I mean.
-What?

09:36.440 --> 09:39.000
-You've become reasonable.
-Not at all.

09:39.720 --> 09:40.800
I've changed methods.

09:43.080 --> 09:44.040
And?

09:45.240 --> 09:46.560
Is the table under your name?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.120
It's in Velmont's name.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.200
Who?

09:51.480 --> 09:54.200
Horace Velmont.
The Canadian who stood me up.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.080
In that case…

10:04.720 --> 10:06.520
Thanks for dinner, Horace Velmont.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.280
-The check, please.
-All right.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.160
Come on!

10:38.600 --> 10:39.800
-Here.
-Thanks.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.880
Hey! Your scooter!

10:48.400 --> 10:49.720
Hey!

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Shit! My scooter!

12:13.600 --> 12:16.080
The Pont Neuf, the quays along the Seine,

12:16.160 --> 12:18.080
you didn't do that on purpose?

12:18.640 --> 12:20.920
-I don't know what you mean.
-Yeah…

12:22.360 --> 12:24.440
Anyway, I loved tonight. Thank you.

12:24.520 --> 12:25.360
Me too.

12:26.600 --> 12:29.160
-Too bad we can't stop time.
-Yeah, too bad.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Good evening, madam.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.480
Good evening, sir.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.080
Come on…

13:02.200 --> 13:03.400
Can't believe it.

13:07.920 --> 13:08.760
Come on.

13:09.880 --> 13:10.960
Ben, you there?

13:12.760 --> 13:14.680
Claire, what are you doing here?

13:14.760 --> 13:16.680
Well, I was in the neighborhood.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.640
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.040
-It's good to see you.
-You too.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.320
Have you heard from Assane? Is he OK?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.840
Yes, don't worry.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.080
-You sure?
-He's fine.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.000
-Claire?
-Who is that?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.880
He's a friend.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.160
A friend?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.440
-Shall I introduce you?
-Yes.

13:43.040 --> 13:43.880
Marc?

13:44.560 --> 13:46.280
So, this is Benjamin.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.640
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.200
A beautiful store.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.600
You don't have to be nice.
Assane's friend. He won't like you.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.960
We're dating, so I can't like his store?

13:56.040 --> 13:56.880
Indeed.

13:58.720 --> 14:01.000
And how's Raoul?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.640
He's great. Thank you.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.560
Cool.

14:05.560 --> 14:08.200
-Well, we'll get going.
-I'll see you out.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.360
Bye, Ben. See you.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.080
Excuse me?

14:18.800 --> 14:21.920
I'd like to give Claire a present.
I saw a bracelet.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.240
-That one, there?
-Yeah.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.320
-Could you hold it for me?
-Sure.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.280
-I'll come back for it.
-Yeah.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.480
That's nice of you.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.680
Before it was a museum,
Orsay was a train station.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.760
The building sheltered prisoners
during the Liberation.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.040
I'd like you to tell that story
to the children.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.320
Of course.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.840
Yes, it'd be wonderful
if they had access to the auditorium.

14:53.920 --> 14:58.280
We could also organize screenings,
concerts, debates.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.120
My assistant can send some suggestions--

15:01.200 --> 15:02.640
Alice, I'm sorry.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.800
-Please excuse me.
-No worries.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.680
-Let's meet up outside.
-Great.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.560
What are you doing here? I'm working.

15:23.160 --> 15:25.080
I was passing by, and I saw you.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.800
-You don't believe me?
-I know you.

15:30.080 --> 15:30.920
Assane…

15:32.040 --> 15:33.360
Last night was nice.

15:33.440 --> 15:34.760
Today could be nice too.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.680
Listen. I loved that night…

15:37.960 --> 15:39.200
We're not 20 anymore.

15:39.720 --> 15:41.480
Like you said yourself,

15:42.120 --> 15:43.560
we can't stop time.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.000
I'm sorry.

15:48.720 --> 15:49.760
I have to go.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.560
-You all right?
-Yes.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.760
What are you doing?

16:17.280 --> 16:18.280
I'm working.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.200
How's that going?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.640
-What's up?
-I have something for you.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.040
Really?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.080
A small gift.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.680
-Go on. Open it.
-Thank you.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.440
I bought it in Ben's store.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.280
He recommended it.
Don't like it? Blame him.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.080
You kidding? It's gorgeous.

16:38.880 --> 16:39.720
I love it.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.240
Thank you.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.800
I'm going to take a picture.
I'll send it to Ben.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.840
-Courbet, have you met my daughter?
-I haven't had the pleasure.

16:58.080 --> 16:58.920
Juliette!

16:59.000 --> 17:01.080
You haven't met Philippe Courbet.

17:01.160 --> 17:03.320
-No. Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.200
He's building the framework
to receive the donations.

17:06.280 --> 17:07.720
Wonderful. Thank you.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.200
Compared to everything you do,
it's not much.

17:11.320 --> 17:12.760
-See you.
-See you.

17:12.840 --> 17:13.680
All right.

17:14.840 --> 17:17.680
There's a package for you.
I put it on your desk.

17:28.560 --> 17:30.080
ATTENTION: JULIETTE PELLEGRINI

17:40.040 --> 17:42.920
PISSARRO STOLEN FROM MUSÉE D'ORSAY

17:51.760 --> 17:55.160
We're all devastated
by what's happened, of course.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.520
The great sadness I'm feeling
extends far beyond

17:58.600 --> 18:01.280
enthusiasts of art and culture.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.040
All of France was wounded today.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.800
SOMETIMES, YOU CAN STOP TIME. A.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.200
Yes?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.640
Two gentlemen are waiting for you.

18:24.720 --> 18:25.920
Yes, I'm coming.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.480
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Hello, madam.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.400
Some questions for you.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.320
-Yes?
-Were you at Musée d'Orsay yesterday?

18:43.880 --> 18:44.880
Yes. Why?

18:45.480 --> 18:47.560
A painting was stolen at the same time.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.120
Did you see anything
unusual or suspicious?

18:53.320 --> 18:54.440
-No.
-Are you sure?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.400
I believe you received a package today.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.480
No, I…

19:01.200 --> 19:02.640
I'm sorry. I assure you…

19:02.720 --> 19:03.680
Don't worry.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.920
No one's accusing you.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.640
That's good.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.480
Well, I'm at your disposal.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.280
-If you need anything, don't hesitate.
-Thanks.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.320
Have a good day.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.920
I'll show you out.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.120
Assane!

19:28.200 --> 19:29.760
Are you crazy?

19:29.840 --> 19:32.320
You can't steal a painting
and send it to me.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.360
You don't like it?

19:34.440 --> 19:37.240
I'm serious. The cops came to question me.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.640
You said we couldn't stop time.
We can.

19:40.240 --> 19:41.400
That painting is proof.

19:42.480 --> 19:43.360
What are you doing?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.560
Dinner,
the ride on the scooter, the painting…

19:48.560 --> 19:49.560
What do you want?

19:50.120 --> 19:50.960
You.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.240
You made your choice a long time ago.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.320
Exactly.

19:58.120 --> 19:59.080
Not the right one.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.000
Claire is the mother of my son,

20:02.880 --> 20:03.840
but nothing more.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.320
-I was wrong about her.
-Stop it, Assane.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.960
Deep down, you're like me.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.640
-You have feelings you won't admit to.
-Really?

20:12.720 --> 20:14.440
Look around. No cops.

20:15.880 --> 20:17.200
You didn't rat me out.

20:18.920 --> 20:20.120
We're here together.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.920
Because we want to be.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.880
It might not be too late.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.400
Prove it to me.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.720
What?

20:30.200 --> 20:31.080
Prove it to me.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.800
Not by stealing a master painting.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.680
How?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.640
Claire.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.080
She's pretty. Pretty eyes, pretty smile.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.920
-Not living the dream--
-You don't know her.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.600
I know more than you think.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.680
You can find out
everything on social media.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.280
-You do that?
-Sometimes.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.440
I noticed a few interesting things.

20:55.840 --> 20:56.840
She has a boyfriend.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.040
Not bad looking.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.120
He gave her a bracelet.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.440
And she clearly loves it.

21:04.840 --> 21:05.840
I love it too.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.760
And?

21:09.160 --> 21:11.320
You stole from the Musée d'Orsay.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.600
You can steal a bracelet from your ex.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.400
You can do it.

21:28.760 --> 21:29.640
A rare model.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.400
Can you track it down?

21:32.400 --> 21:34.960
The bracelet was in my possession
for a bit…

21:35.840 --> 21:37.360
-I sold it.
-To whom?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.520
-I could buy it back.
-No.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.120
No.

21:43.000 --> 21:43.840
OK.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.240
-You sold it to Claire.
-Yes.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.520
-Not exactly.
-What do you mean? Did you or did you not?

21:51.600 --> 21:54.480
The guy she was with bought it from me.
Marc.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.720
-I didn't like him.
-Really?

21:58.800 --> 22:00.160
-No.
-And why not?

22:02.680 --> 22:04.840
-OK. He was very nice.
-There you go.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.400
This bracelet is a rare piece.
You won't find another one like it.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.560
So if Juliette wants it,
you'll have to steal it.

22:14.120 --> 22:15.000
From Claire.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.320
-Where are you going with that makeup?
-Nowhere.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.920
I ran into Céleste's mother.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.640
You were chatting
with a young Black man yesterday.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.120
You seemed to know him very well.

23:02.200 --> 23:06.400
I said you didn't know any Black boys.
Though I have a pretty good idea.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.240
I forbid you to see him.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.920
-Who said I was--
-Juliette.

23:14.840 --> 23:16.760
We've nothing in common
with those people.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.080
Understand?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.440
ARSÈNE LUPIN VERSUS HERLOCK SHOLMÈS

25:17.680 --> 25:18.760
Here, as promised.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.480
Not bad.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.280
So? What do we do now?

25:37.840 --> 25:39.640
I'd like for us to start over.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.160
No more lies.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.120
You're right. I'm a reasonable guy.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.000
I'll return the painting.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.120
And Claire's bracelet.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.120
We've never been allowed to be together.

25:57.200 --> 25:59.400
-Really?
-You know that.

26:00.160 --> 26:01.120
I don't anymore.

26:01.760 --> 26:02.600
Your father.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.520
-He's always been against us.
-Stop obsessing over him.

26:08.040 --> 26:10.720
-What do you want?
-To live our story.

26:11.680 --> 26:14.480
You want me to choose
between you and my father?

26:14.560 --> 26:15.640
I didn't say that.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.320
He framed my father 25 years ago.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.600
-What?
-You don't know the whole story.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.080
Go see your mother. She knows.

26:32.160 --> 26:34.640
My mother has nothing to do with him.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.520
Exactly. Go see her.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.240
She'll tell you the truth.

26:40.480 --> 26:43.040
Once you've heard the truth,
you'll do what's necessary.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.320
-Here.
-What's this?

26:48.920 --> 26:49.840
The name of a cop.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.800
Ganimard.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.040
A trustworthy guy.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.320
Your mom can talk to him.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.120
We missed our chance when we were young.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.360
Now we know what we want.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.120
Here.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
You know where to find me. Remember?

27:32.360 --> 27:35.800
Here, you have
Pissarro's The Seine and the Louvre.

27:36.600 --> 27:40.480
Right behind,
Toulouse-Lautrec's masterpiece.

28:00.000 --> 28:05.040
PISSARRO'S PAINTING RETURNED
TO THE MUSÉE D'ORSAY

28:50.440 --> 28:53.720
A WEEK EARLIER

28:56.160 --> 28:57.600
So, what's the plan now?

28:58.800 --> 28:59.640
Assane?

29:00.960 --> 29:02.120
Don't worry.

29:03.760 --> 29:06.320
Pellegrini went after my son.
I'll do the same.

29:08.120 --> 29:09.560
Aiming for the daughter.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.200
We've got work to do.

29:18.360 --> 29:21.760
Hi, I'd like to book a table
for two tomorrow evening.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.520
A table near the window.

29:25.920 --> 29:26.760
Perfect.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.400
Of course. My name's Horace Velmont.
V-E-L-M-O-N-T.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.120
Thank you, sir. Bye.

29:34.720 --> 29:38.280
Great. You'll call Juliette
and pretend to be this Velmont.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.520
I'll tell her the foundation's amazing.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.280
That I want to make a donation
and meet her.

29:44.360 --> 29:48.600
I'm flying back to Montreal,
so I'll offer to meet that very evening.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.560
Exactly.

29:49.640 --> 29:51.640
Yes, that would be wonderful.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.720
We could have dinner together.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.520
The rest has to come from her.
That's the key.

29:59.880 --> 30:00.840
Come inside.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.400
I'll cover my tracks.

30:02.480 --> 30:04.080
She'll never imagine…

30:04.160 --> 30:05.640
The food here is good.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.360
Is the table under your name?

30:07.440 --> 30:08.400
…she was manipulated.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.480
In Velmont's name.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.400
-Who?
-Horace Velmont.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.000
In that case, thanks for dinner,
Horace Velmont.

30:14.640 --> 30:15.920
Come on!

30:16.000 --> 30:18.760
We'll pay the waiter
so he won't come after us.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.280
Pay the bill upfront.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.480
Hey! Your scooter!

30:28.880 --> 30:31.360
And compensate the delivery guy.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.120
Then…

30:39.920 --> 30:40.760
Magic happens.

30:50.760 --> 30:52.880
She has to believe
I'd do anything for her.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.960
She'd do anything for me.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.080
Even betray her father.

31:07.560 --> 31:08.800
I'm following so far.

31:08.880 --> 31:11.840
-How are we going to steal the painting?
-We won't.

31:13.760 --> 31:15.680
We'll make her think it was stolen.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.600
Watch this video
about the Notre-Dame fire.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.480
You change the banner.

31:25.280 --> 31:26.120
There you go.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.920
We're all devastated
by what's happened, of course.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.360
The great sadness I'm feeling
extends far beyond

31:34.440 --> 31:36.720
enthusiasts of art and culture.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.160
All of France was wounded today.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.040
I'll send her fake notifications.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.160
I have guys to play along.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.840
What do you want with Étienne?

31:59.040 --> 32:01.320
Don't worry. No one is accusing you.

32:01.960 --> 32:02.800
That's good.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.960
We need a forged painting.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.920
I'm counting on you.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.280
It shouldn't be a problem.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.160
So, really…

32:18.280 --> 32:20.360
we're not the ones trapping Pellegrini.

32:21.960 --> 32:22.920
His daughter is.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.320
What's going on, dear?

32:28.040 --> 32:30.160
Assane Diop told me to come see you.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.400
I've been kept in the dark for too long.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.440
I need to know.

32:42.480 --> 32:43.960
Your father needed money.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.560
He found the perfect scapegoat.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.720
Diop's confession didn't earn him
a reduced sentence.

32:53.880 --> 32:54.880
Your father lied.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.760
Why didn't you say anything?
Or report him?

32:58.840 --> 33:01.760
Why?
Because he was the father of my daughter.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.480
You loved him so much.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.840
I didn't want trouble
or to deprive you of him.

33:07.520 --> 33:08.360
Mom…

33:09.880 --> 33:14.280
This needs to stop.
You have to tell the truth about Dad.

33:17.760 --> 33:19.320
Talk to the police.

33:20.400 --> 33:21.240
I don't know.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.560
Here. Go see this person.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.400
Tell him what you know.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.360
It's the only thing to do.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.360
OK. All this for a coffee date.
