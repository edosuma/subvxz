00:00.985 --> 00:02.868
- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- Listen to the watch.

00:02.870 --> 00:06.596
It's ticking. Synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

00:06.629 --> 00:08.646
Stand upon the back of the chair.

00:08.681 --> 00:10.998
So you could get him to
do anything you wanted?

00:11.050 --> 00:13.167
I want you to find my sister.

00:13.169 --> 00:16.504
<i>Her condition, some poison in her blood.</i>

00:16.506 --> 00:18.639
I announce my candidacy for mayor.

00:18.674 --> 00:20.174
(crowd cheering)

00:20.176 --> 00:22.143
ALFRED: <i>Hugo Strange made another you.</i>

00:22.178 --> 00:23.238
- He's gone.
- BRUCE: He cut his hair.

00:23.262 --> 00:24.729
To look more like you.

00:24.764 --> 00:26.297
Does Alfred know you have his car?

00:26.332 --> 00:28.265
Would you like to go for a ride?

00:29.485 --> 00:31.447
JERVIS: The ticking synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

00:31.471 --> 00:34.071
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

00:34.107 --> 00:35.189
Step off the ledge.

00:35.191 --> 00:36.574
Stop!

00:39.245 --> 00:40.661
(door opens)

00:42.665 --> 00:44.615
You don't understand.

00:44.667 --> 00:48.536
My-my brother will find out I'm
here, and he'll come for me.

00:48.538 --> 00:50.037
Nothing will stop him.

00:50.072 --> 00:51.956
This is the brother
that took you to Strange

00:52.008 --> 00:53.124
to try and fix you?

00:53.176 --> 00:54.675
What? No.

00:54.710 --> 00:57.294
Jervis kept me a
prisoner most of my life,

00:57.346 --> 00:59.680
and when I finally managed to escape,

00:59.715 --> 01:01.849
I ran as far away from him as I could.

01:01.884 --> 01:03.217
Mm-hmm, and landed in Gotham.

01:03.219 --> 01:06.220
It seemed like a good place to hide.

01:06.222 --> 01:09.523
Until Strange found me and
locked me in Indian Hill.

01:09.559 --> 01:12.943
I'll admit, not the best luck
for you or your future landlord.

01:12.979 --> 01:14.812
That was an accident.

01:14.864 --> 01:17.398
The infecting part or the
lighting him on fire part?

01:17.400 --> 01:19.366
I'm not a monster!

01:19.402 --> 01:21.819
But if you want to see one,

01:21.871 --> 01:24.889
just wait until my brother comes for me.

01:26.442 --> 01:28.442
You don't know what he's capable of.

01:29.962 --> 01:32.379
This isn't over.

01:34.217 --> 01:36.784
For either of us.

01:38.087 --> 01:41.222
(faint carnival music playing)

01:41.257 --> 01:43.591
It's perfect!

01:43.593 --> 01:45.759
Oh, my sister used to
love amusement parks.

01:45.761 --> 01:49.396
The rides, the food, the
tents with amazing acts.

01:49.432 --> 01:51.816
That's why I became a performer.

01:51.851 --> 01:54.168
Are you a family man?

01:54.203 --> 01:55.686
Yes.

01:55.738 --> 01:57.354
I am a family man.

01:59.809 --> 02:03.861
The day I lost her was
the saddest of my life.

02:03.913 --> 02:06.747
The only thing that got me through,

02:06.782 --> 02:09.366
that kept me sane,

02:09.418 --> 02:12.586
was the hope of one day
being together again.

02:14.624 --> 02:16.240
Reunited.

02:16.275 --> 02:18.692
And if all goes well,

02:18.728 --> 02:22.379
that day is today.

02:27.470 --> 02:30.855
Of course, a reunion like this

02:30.890 --> 02:33.591
needs to be a private affair.

02:33.626 --> 02:35.476
You understand.

02:43.486 --> 02:46.654
It's Election Day in Gotham,
with former mayor Aubrey James

02:46.706 --> 02:49.874
and former criminal
kingpin Oswald Cobblepot

02:49.909 --> 02:51.208
running toe to toe...

02:51.244 --> 02:52.721
GILZEAN: Why don't you take care of it.

02:52.745 --> 02:54.211
Appreciate it.

02:54.247 --> 02:55.329
Thank you.

02:58.501 --> 03:00.417
OSWALD: I must say, you are looking

03:00.453 --> 03:02.136
quite the dapper fellow.

03:03.339 --> 03:05.506
(chuckles) I had to
guess on the jacket size.

03:05.558 --> 03:08.776
- I hope it fits.
- Perfectly.

03:08.811 --> 03:10.261
I cannot thank you enough.

03:10.313 --> 03:11.629
It's just a suit.

03:11.664 --> 03:13.480
No. No, if it weren't for you,

03:13.516 --> 03:16.967
I would still be falling asleep
to the screams of the insane.

03:17.003 --> 03:19.486
It becomes almost a white noise
after a while, doesn't it?

03:19.522 --> 03:20.905
It does.

03:20.940 --> 03:23.274
I do believe, Oswald,

03:23.326 --> 03:27.044
Arkham has made us both stronger.

03:28.864 --> 03:30.531
I couldn't agree more.

03:30.533 --> 03:33.834
Which is why I had

03:33.869 --> 03:35.202
our release certificates framed.

03:35.204 --> 03:38.038
A reminder of past struggles

03:38.040 --> 03:40.374
and new beginnings.

03:40.376 --> 03:41.842
If I didn't know better,

03:41.877 --> 03:43.677
I'd accuse you of
being a sentimentalist.

03:43.713 --> 03:45.212
Guilty.

03:45.214 --> 03:46.463
(both laugh)

03:46.515 --> 03:48.716
You all set, boss? Busy day today.

03:48.718 --> 03:50.478
Who were those people
you were speaking with?

03:51.520 --> 03:53.637
Don't worry about it.

03:53.689 --> 03:55.272
Come now, Butch. Play nice.

03:55.308 --> 03:57.355
We're all on the same team here.

03:57.393 --> 03:59.059
Right?

03:59.061 --> 04:01.028
My team. (giggles)

04:01.063 --> 04:02.563
Yeah. Sure.

04:02.565 --> 04:03.731
Whatever you say.

04:05.804 --> 04:08.202
You keep your nose out of my business.

04:08.237 --> 04:09.570
NYGMA: Yeah.

04:09.572 --> 04:10.654
Sure.

04:12.008 --> 04:13.874
Whatever you say.

04:19.498 --> 04:20.630
(sighs)

04:21.666 --> 04:24.001
Why is it that every time

04:24.053 --> 04:25.419
something hits the fan around here,

04:25.421 --> 04:27.721
I inevitably find you
at the center of it?

04:27.757 --> 04:29.039
I was just working a job.

04:29.075 --> 04:30.557
Her brother asked me to find her.

04:30.593 --> 04:32.843
Yeah. You're some sort
of P.I. now? Is that it?

04:32.895 --> 04:34.928
I'm whatever pays the bills. Great.

04:34.930 --> 04:37.081
What do we know about this girl's blood?

04:37.116 --> 04:39.817
Not much. She claims infecting
the landlord was an accident.

04:39.852 --> 04:41.518
Have Thompkins draw some samples,

04:41.570 --> 04:43.604
see if she can find out what
we're dealing with here.

04:43.606 --> 04:45.000
And pick up the brother for questioning.

04:45.024 --> 04:47.691
Any idea where we might find him?

04:47.727 --> 04:49.943
No. But when I do, I'll let you know.

04:49.945 --> 04:51.362
We have some unfinished business.

04:51.397 --> 04:52.329
Not anymore.

04:52.365 --> 04:53.947
This is an active investigation.

04:53.983 --> 04:56.250
You go anywhere near him,
I'll have you arrested.

04:56.285 --> 04:58.118
For what?

04:58.120 --> 05:01.121
No law against two private
citizens having a chat.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.738
I'll come by later to pick up my check.

05:09.369 --> 05:12.249
I bet I'd make a kick-ass P.I.

05:12.284 --> 05:14.101
Get out.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:24.563 --> 05:26.647
Have you had this condition since birth?

05:28.484 --> 05:29.888
Tell me about it.

05:30.974 --> 05:32.820
If a person comes into
contact with my blood,

05:32.822 --> 05:34.271
it changes them.

05:35.574 --> 05:37.694
It affects every person differently.

05:38.052 --> 05:42.596
My brother believes it brings
out a person's true nature.

05:42.631 --> 05:45.766
Is your brother infected?

05:45.801 --> 05:48.435
Is that why you're so terrified of him?

05:48.471 --> 05:50.471
Jervis isn't infected.

05:50.506 --> 05:53.757
He believes we're connected.

05:54.543 --> 05:56.560
Two sides of the same coin.

05:57.424 --> 06:01.014
My way is the blood, and his, the mind.

06:01.016 --> 06:03.033
Hypnosis.

06:04.270 --> 06:06.603
It goes <i> way</i> beyond that.

06:06.639 --> 06:09.656
He preys on fear,

06:09.692 --> 06:11.992
anger, regret.

06:12.027 --> 06:15.012
And if he gets in your mind...

06:17.032 --> 06:19.149
you're doomed.

06:21.704 --> 06:24.421
MAN (over megaphone):
Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,

06:24.457 --> 06:26.290
your next mayor of Gotham!
Vote for Cobblepot.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.709
Here you go. Cobblepot for mayor.

06:28.711 --> 06:32.463
And Make Gotham Safe Again!

06:32.515 --> 06:34.298
(walk signal ticking)

06:34.350 --> 06:38.719
Vote for Oswald Cobblepot,
your next mayor of Gotham!

06:38.771 --> 06:40.220
(walk signal continues ticking)

06:40.272 --> 06:44.224
JERVIS: <i>You are so very
tired of life, aren't you?</i>

06:44.276 --> 06:46.810
<i>Do you hear my watch ticking?</i>

06:46.862 --> 06:49.563
<i>(watch ticking)</i>

06:52.568 --> 06:56.236
<i>Hard road for you, Jim Gordon.</i>

06:56.238 --> 06:57.704
<i>Listen closer.</i>

06:57.740 --> 07:00.908
(amplified heartbeat)

07:00.910 --> 07:04.995
<i>You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?</i>

07:05.047 --> 07:07.047
<i>Now you can rest, Jim.</i>

07:07.082 --> 07:08.749
(ticking and heartbeat slows)

07:15.758 --> 07:18.809
(truck horn blaring)

07:20.646 --> 07:21.929
Hey, pal!

07:23.599 --> 07:25.766
You got a death wish or something?

07:32.848 --> 07:35.232
ALFRED: Right, yes. Well,
will do. Thank you very much.

07:35.267 --> 07:36.433
Good-bye.

07:38.187 --> 07:40.103
Well, that was the impound
yard from downtown.

07:40.105 --> 07:41.504
It appears the Rolls

07:41.540 --> 07:43.573
was towed only this
morning, Master Bruce.

07:43.609 --> 07:45.775
This doesn't make any sense.

07:45.827 --> 07:48.445
- Why would he leave?
- Well, he cut his hair

07:48.480 --> 07:51.364
to look more like you,
if that's even possible.

07:51.416 --> 07:52.810
You think he went to the
city to pretend to be me.

07:52.834 --> 07:55.986
- Yeah, absolutely. Bloody yes.
- So where would he go?

07:56.021 --> 07:58.455
Take in a show, do a little
bit of shopping, have a facial?

07:58.457 --> 08:00.957
I mean, where do pain-resistant clones

08:00.959 --> 08:03.076
of multibillionaire
teenagers normally go?

08:03.111 --> 08:05.028
- Alfred.
- Well, I don't know.

08:05.063 --> 08:07.464
The car was found at 11th
and Dillon, wasn't it?

08:07.499 --> 08:08.932
That's in the Narrows.

08:08.967 --> 08:12.371
So I suppose we should be thankful
there's anything left to tow.

08:16.108 --> 08:19.142
What in the dickens was he doing
down there in the first place?

08:20.195 --> 08:22.279
Selina.

08:25.345 --> 08:27.817
11th and Dillon is near her apartment.

08:27.869 --> 08:29.319
Sorry, again, for the way I acted

08:29.371 --> 08:30.954
when you came by yesterday.

08:30.989 --> 08:32.371
Any word on your friend Ivy?

08:32.407 --> 08:34.073
No. (chuckles)

08:34.126 --> 08:36.042
I even braved a beat-down
from Sonny to see

08:36.078 --> 08:38.871
if she was growing magic
mushrooms for him again.

08:38.895 --> 08:41.464
- Magic what?
- Mushrooms.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.500
Sonny Gilzean.

08:43.501 --> 08:46.136
Pounded you to within
an inch of your life.

08:46.171 --> 08:48.338
Yeah. Sonny, right.

08:48.340 --> 08:50.307
Well, this is it.

08:50.342 --> 08:52.592
Time to earn a living.

08:52.644 --> 08:54.177
- You work here?
- No.

08:54.179 --> 08:55.679
I rob here.

08:55.681 --> 08:56.980
- What?
- (sighs)

08:57.015 --> 08:58.815
The Bang Bang Room is a betting parlor.

08:58.850 --> 09:00.600
Should be flush today
with the mayor's race.

09:00.652 --> 09:03.186
Meet me around back in five minutes.

09:05.322 --> 09:06.461
Selina.

09:07.526 --> 09:09.826
MAN: Yeah! (laughs) Pay up!

09:09.861 --> 09:11.861
(music playing, lively chatter)

09:19.456 --> 09:21.623
Hey, that guy at the end of the bar

09:21.675 --> 09:23.341
said you're buying the place a round.

09:23.376 --> 09:24.209
(scoffs) What?

09:24.211 --> 09:26.878
Mm-hmm. Oh, and your mom sucks.

09:27.714 --> 09:29.130
Or something.

09:29.182 --> 09:30.882
Really?

09:36.223 --> 09:37.722
Hey, wise guy!

09:37.724 --> 09:39.140
Here's your drink!

09:39.192 --> 09:40.475
(crowd clamoring)

09:44.564 --> 09:46.064
Get him off me! That's enough!

09:59.579 --> 10:00.745
(door opens)

10:01.915 --> 10:03.414
Who the hell are you?

10:03.416 --> 10:05.333
Sorry.

10:05.385 --> 10:06.501
My first day.

10:06.553 --> 10:07.752
Uh...

10:07.754 --> 10:09.470
can you help me find the cherries?

10:09.506 --> 10:10.922
No?

10:10.924 --> 10:13.141
Probably behind the bar. Right.

10:13.176 --> 10:14.259
Uh, I'll go check.

10:14.261 --> 10:16.010
Hey, Squirrel,

10:16.062 --> 10:18.246
what's the odds of a
person getting out of here

10:18.281 --> 10:19.581
in one piece?

10:19.616 --> 10:21.099
Not good, boss.

10:25.522 --> 10:29.157
My beloved mother

10:29.192 --> 10:31.492
always believed in me.

10:31.528 --> 10:36.130
Even when I doubted
myself, she held firm.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.586
Seeing all of your bright
faces reminds me that

10:41.621 --> 10:46.541
there is nothing you cannot
do if you put your mind to it.

10:46.593 --> 10:51.379
And when I am mayor, I believe...

10:51.431 --> 10:56.134
no... I <i> know</i> that together,

10:56.186 --> 10:59.053
we will Make Gotham Safe Again!

10:59.105 --> 11:00.305
(crowd cheering)

11:06.446 --> 11:07.896
Excuse me.

11:08.782 --> 11:10.448
Are you on the election board?

11:10.483 --> 11:11.983
Yeah.

11:11.985 --> 11:13.368
I work for Mr. Cobblepot.

11:13.403 --> 11:15.820
He just wanted me to confirm
what Butch gave you. May I?

11:15.822 --> 11:17.322
Thank you.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.161
It's all there.

11:23.163 --> 11:24.163
Thank you.

11:26.672 --> 11:29.417
Follow him for the rest of the day.

11:29.469 --> 11:31.586
Don't let him leave your sight.

11:38.561 --> 11:41.729
(Barbara gasps) Well, look who's back.

11:43.767 --> 11:45.566
I saw you last night.

11:45.602 --> 11:47.685
You didn't even say hi. Rude.

11:47.737 --> 11:50.388
- I need to find Jervis Tetch.
- Oh, you mean

11:50.423 --> 11:53.441
"The Great Jervis Tetch,
Hypnotist Extraordinaire"?

11:53.493 --> 11:56.661
You believe it actually says
that on his business card?

11:56.696 --> 11:58.446
Number's been disconnected. Where is he?

11:58.498 --> 11:59.864
I don't know.

11:59.866 --> 12:01.532
Magic shop, bunny farm...

12:01.584 --> 12:04.502
Someplace where everyone
wears top hats and drinks tea?

12:04.537 --> 12:06.120
- (giggles)
- Barbara.

12:06.172 --> 12:08.373
You know, I'm not sure
I like this new thing

12:08.375 --> 12:10.842
of you storming in here every time

12:10.877 --> 12:11.877
you need something.

12:11.928 --> 12:13.711
It's almost like we're married.

12:13.713 --> 12:14.713
Scary thought.

12:18.885 --> 12:21.052
I need a favor.

12:21.104 --> 12:23.304
Oh...

12:23.356 --> 12:27.475
Then you must be monumentally screwed.

12:27.527 --> 12:31.312
What happened? Did he hypnotize you?

12:31.364 --> 12:33.564
Make you bark like a dog?

12:33.616 --> 12:35.900
He's dangerous, Barbara.

12:35.952 --> 12:38.403
Don't say I didn't warn you.

12:39.656 --> 12:41.155
Okay.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.994
He came in here earlier.

12:46.046 --> 12:48.046
Said he wanted to hire some muscle.

12:48.081 --> 12:49.881
- Muscle?
- Yeah.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.027
For some performance he's planning.

12:51.051 --> 12:52.867
Said he needed them to have flair.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.085
What'd you tell him?

12:54.087 --> 12:56.170
It's Gotham, baby.

12:56.222 --> 12:59.390
We've all got flair.

12:59.426 --> 13:01.592
Thanks.

13:01.594 --> 13:04.262
- (Barbara laughing)
- GORDON: Always a help.

13:04.264 --> 13:05.763
Ugh!

13:10.603 --> 13:11.602
<i>(bell dings)</i>

13:11.604 --> 13:14.072
(grunting)

13:20.246 --> 13:22.196
(screams)

13:22.248 --> 13:23.865
(laughs)

13:23.917 --> 13:25.116
(man speaks foreign language)

13:25.168 --> 13:26.951
JERVIS: Excellent!

13:29.422 --> 13:32.623
Deever and Dumfree, I presume.

13:32.675 --> 13:34.292
The Terrible Tweeds.

13:34.344 --> 13:37.128
Your reputation precedes you.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.963
And you are?

13:38.965 --> 13:40.798
Jervis Tetch.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.602
I have a job that might
suit your particular skills.

13:44.637 --> 13:47.472
My sister's been taken by the GCPD.

13:47.524 --> 13:50.058
I need to get her back.

13:51.811 --> 13:55.313
You want to break
someone out of the GCPD?

13:55.365 --> 13:56.914
Not "someone."

13:56.950 --> 13:58.900
My sister.

13:58.935 --> 14:02.620
I assumed men like yourselves
understood the bond

14:02.655 --> 14:04.122
of family.

14:06.359 --> 14:08.159
What's in it for us?

14:08.161 --> 14:10.578
Does he... ever speak?

14:10.630 --> 14:13.331
(grumbles)

14:13.333 --> 14:14.999
Regardless, if you'll do the courtesy

14:15.034 --> 14:18.669
of listening to me, I think you'll find

14:18.671 --> 14:21.005
- I can be quite persuasive.
- (watch ticking)

14:21.057 --> 14:23.341
(amplified heartbeat)

14:32.136 --> 14:34.803
BOOKIE: Place is packed to the gills.

14:34.838 --> 14:37.656
It's running two to one, for Penguin.

14:37.691 --> 14:39.758
Mm. Sounds like you're busy.

14:40.319 --> 14:41.902
Maybe I should go, huh?

14:41.937 --> 14:43.570
No. This won't take long.

14:43.622 --> 14:45.405
I hate people with sticky fingers.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.411
Okay, wait.

14:47.424 --> 14:48.840
W-What do you... what do you need?

14:48.892 --> 14:51.843
Huh? Money? Information?

14:51.895 --> 14:53.594
I could be useful.

14:53.646 --> 14:55.897
Oh, you will be.

14:55.932 --> 14:57.432
You'll send a message.

14:59.069 --> 15:00.518
But maybe...

15:00.570 --> 15:02.820
I don't got to do this.

15:02.856 --> 15:04.455
I mean, maybe...

15:04.491 --> 15:06.524
you learned your lesson.

15:06.576 --> 15:07.992
Yeah, totally. I...

15:08.027 --> 15:09.127
(snickers)

15:09.680 --> 15:11.496
You're screwing with me, aren't you?

15:11.531 --> 15:12.613
Yeah.

15:12.615 --> 15:14.198
Do it.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.867
(knock on door)

15:17.787 --> 15:19.537
(panting)

15:24.010 --> 15:25.209
(grunts)

15:27.597 --> 15:28.679
Bruce?

15:33.636 --> 15:35.303
(groans)

15:39.976 --> 15:40.976
(yells)

15:57.710 --> 15:58.710
Let's go.

16:01.831 --> 16:03.748
And although some have
criticized Mr. Cobblepot

16:03.750 --> 16:06.584
for running a campaign based
largely on name-calling

16:06.586 --> 16:07.947
and fear-mongering... (knock on door)

16:07.971 --> 16:09.888
His simple message of

16:09.923 --> 16:11.901
- "Make Gotham Safe Again" has...
- (TV clicks off)

16:11.925 --> 16:14.425
Can you believe Penguin
might win this thing?

16:14.427 --> 16:16.094
Whole city's going to hell

16:16.146 --> 16:17.262
in a handbasket.

16:17.314 --> 16:18.763
(groans, inhales sharply)

16:18.815 --> 16:20.565
You okay?

16:20.600 --> 16:22.350
Fine.

16:22.402 --> 16:23.735
I assume

16:23.770 --> 16:25.904
you didn't come here
to ask about my health.

16:27.284 --> 16:29.440
I need to speak with Alice Tetch.

16:29.442 --> 16:30.858
No.

16:30.911 --> 16:32.321
Five minutes, that's all I'm asking.

16:32.345 --> 16:34.223
She's scheduled to be moved
to a facility upstate.

16:34.247 --> 16:35.613
I'm sure she'll have
plenty of time then.

16:35.615 --> 16:36.998
This can't wait.

16:37.761 --> 16:39.217
What's going on?

16:43.006 --> 16:44.706
You can talk to me, son.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.392
Her brother.

16:47.427 --> 16:49.460
I had a run-in with him last night.

16:49.512 --> 16:52.380
Think he may have done something to me.

16:52.432 --> 16:53.881
Like what?

16:53.934 --> 16:55.300
I don't know.

16:57.604 --> 16:59.587
I'm having thoughts.

17:01.691 --> 17:04.058
(sighs) Look...

17:04.109 --> 17:05.660
you've caught some bad breaks.

17:05.694 --> 17:07.829
Blackgate. Lee.

17:07.864 --> 17:09.791
I don't know what happened
when you went to see her,

17:09.816 --> 17:11.316
but I can take a pretty good guess.

17:13.252 --> 17:15.435
But at some point, you're
gonna have to make peace

17:15.472 --> 17:17.755
with the decisions you've made.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.924
And what if I can't?

17:21.944 --> 17:24.127
Take it from me,

17:24.164 --> 17:26.381
you don't want to wake
up one day and realize

17:26.415 --> 17:29.083
that 20 years has gone by.

17:30.470 --> 17:34.339
(sighs) We're keeping
Alice in interrogation.

17:34.391 --> 17:36.341
Five minutes.

17:38.478 --> 17:40.011
(door opens)

17:43.566 --> 17:45.683
What was that back there?

17:45.735 --> 17:47.769
- What?
- You.

17:47.821 --> 17:51.689
Remind me to give props
to Alfred on his training.

17:51.691 --> 17:54.242
I did not think you had that in you.

17:54.277 --> 17:56.327
(panting): Me neither.

17:56.363 --> 17:57.612
You okay?

17:57.664 --> 17:59.113
You?

17:59.165 --> 18:01.199
A little lightheaded.

18:02.552 --> 18:03.753
Bruce.

18:04.929 --> 18:07.538
- Oh... You need a hospital.
- No.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.123
No hospitals.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.878
- Are those scars?
- Nothing, they're nothing.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.630
You're not Bruce.

18:15.682 --> 18:17.215
Selina, just...

18:17.217 --> 18:19.133
- You're not Bruce.
- Just-just listen...

18:19.185 --> 18:21.719
- What the hell are you?!
- I won't hurt you. Just let me...

18:21.771 --> 18:23.938
Just let me explain.

18:26.776 --> 18:30.561
I assume you know Butch is
paying campaign officials

18:30.563 --> 18:31.562
to buy the election?

18:31.564 --> 18:33.064
You don't approve?

18:33.066 --> 18:34.065
(both chuckle)

18:34.067 --> 18:35.700
My dear Ed, this is Gotham.

18:35.735 --> 18:37.118
This is how things are done.

18:37.153 --> 18:38.953
And in theory, I support that.

18:38.988 --> 18:40.405
But, Oswald,

18:40.457 --> 18:43.291
Do you see how these people
are cheering for you?

18:43.326 --> 18:46.411
Yes, they... do seem very excited.

18:46.463 --> 18:48.746
You can win this on your own.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.499
Why risk it? There is no upside.

18:51.551 --> 18:53.863
I want this, Ed. I want this
like I've never wanted anything.

18:53.887 --> 18:55.086
I know.

18:55.088 --> 18:58.339
Which is why you need to call off Butch.

19:02.178 --> 19:03.678
Mr. Penguin?

19:03.730 --> 19:05.146
Hello, there.

19:05.181 --> 19:08.483
I wanted to thank you for
getting rid of all the monsters.

19:08.518 --> 19:10.435
(chuckles softly)

19:12.655 --> 19:14.572
Do you see?

19:14.607 --> 19:16.607
People look at me differently now.

19:16.609 --> 19:18.943
For the first time in my life,

19:18.945 --> 19:20.328
I feel wanted.

19:20.363 --> 19:22.029
Nice doing business with you.

19:28.621 --> 19:31.038
And how do you feel now?

19:31.091 --> 19:32.507
I feel like I've misjudged someone

19:32.542 --> 19:34.008
who was supposed to be my friend.

19:34.043 --> 19:35.460
I <i> am</i> your friend.

19:35.512 --> 19:38.546
I can't be bought, but I
can be stolen with a glance.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.515
I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.300
- What am I?
- I don't care.

19:42.352 --> 19:44.802
I do not need a stupid riddle right now.

19:44.854 --> 19:47.305
I know what I want.

19:47.307 --> 19:49.640
I want to be mayor.

19:49.692 --> 19:51.442
Stay out of it, Ed.

19:51.478 --> 19:53.478
I'm warning you.

19:58.318 --> 20:00.151
I need to find your brother.

20:01.955 --> 20:04.238
You turn me in, and
now you want my help.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.408
I was hoping we could help each other.

20:08.711 --> 20:11.329
He's still in your head, isn't he?

20:17.777 --> 20:19.887
GORDON: How do I stop it?

20:19.923 --> 20:20.988
ALICE: I don't know.

20:21.024 --> 20:22.223
Most of the time,

20:22.258 --> 20:24.509
once the trance is broken, that's it.

20:24.511 --> 20:25.560
You should've been fine

20:25.595 --> 20:26.677
the moment you stepped off the ledge.

20:26.679 --> 20:28.179
Then why is it still happening?

20:28.181 --> 20:31.682
Jervis has tapped into something
you're struggling with.

20:31.734 --> 20:34.101
Something a part of
you would do anything

20:34.154 --> 20:35.736
not to face.

20:35.772 --> 20:38.189
Then give me something to
fight this until I find him.

20:38.191 --> 20:41.542
There's usually a trigger that
brings on the hypnotic state.

20:41.578 --> 20:43.528
What's the last thing you remember?

20:43.530 --> 20:46.364
He pulled out his watch.

20:46.366 --> 20:47.882
Asked if I could hear it ticking.

20:47.917 --> 20:49.333
That's it, then.

20:49.369 --> 20:50.751
His watch.

20:50.787 --> 20:54.288
Anything resembling the ticking
will trigger the impulse.

20:55.508 --> 20:58.159
He's made you a prisoner
in your own skin.

21:00.463 --> 21:02.296
He did it to you.

21:02.348 --> 21:04.348
When we were kids.

21:06.352 --> 21:10.254
At first, he did it to control me.

21:10.290 --> 21:12.590
Keep me with him.

21:12.625 --> 21:13.908
But then he started

21:13.943 --> 21:17.178
putting other thoughts in my head.

21:17.213 --> 21:19.614
Thoughts a...

21:19.649 --> 21:22.483
Thoughts a brother should never have.

21:24.487 --> 21:27.238
That's why I wanted to kill him.

21:29.492 --> 21:31.659
I won't go back to him.

21:33.663 --> 21:35.329
Not ever.

21:40.086 --> 21:42.620
(carnival music playing)

21:42.655 --> 21:44.972
(calling whistle)

21:45.008 --> 21:46.408
(clown horn honking, whistle blows)

21:47.927 --> 21:49.143
Yeah!

21:49.178 --> 21:50.645
(laughs) Everybody!

21:50.680 --> 21:53.481
Come on! Huh?

21:53.516 --> 21:55.366
JERVIS (recorded): Ladies and gentlemen!

21:55.401 --> 21:57.101
It is with great excitement

21:57.103 --> 21:58.402
that we welcome you to our show.

21:58.438 --> 21:59.937
It's him.

21:59.939 --> 22:01.606
He's come for me.

22:01.658 --> 22:03.274
Getting you out of here.

22:03.276 --> 22:04.942
To wrestling's most notorious family,

22:04.944 --> 22:08.696
here to entertain and amaze!

22:08.748 --> 22:10.281
The Terrible Tweeds.

22:10.283 --> 22:12.883
Let the show begin!

22:13.953 --> 22:15.369
(screaming)

22:18.258 --> 22:19.757
(screaming, clamoring)

22:21.544 --> 22:22.544
(yells)

22:26.215 --> 22:27.465
Harvey, look out behind you!

22:36.526 --> 22:38.059
Hello, sis.

22:39.279 --> 22:41.312
We both know you can't kill me.

22:41.364 --> 22:43.931
Not until I remove that nagging

22:43.967 --> 22:46.150
little impulse I planted.

22:46.202 --> 22:48.152
Turn around, hands in the air.

22:51.708 --> 22:53.708
(watch ticking)

22:58.665 --> 23:00.131
(amplified heartbeat)

23:00.166 --> 23:02.166
GORDON: Alice, go.

23:02.218 --> 23:04.085
Now.

23:04.137 --> 23:06.170
Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

23:06.222 --> 23:07.588
ALICE: No!

23:07.640 --> 23:09.674
I doubt I'll be seeing you again.

23:09.726 --> 23:11.809
ALICE: Get off me! Let go!

23:11.844 --> 23:13.594
(screams) Mr. Gordon!

23:23.560 --> 23:26.194
Ugh.

23:26.894 --> 23:28.427
It really doesn't hurt?

23:28.429 --> 23:29.762
No.

23:29.814 --> 23:33.516
Whatever they did to me at
Indian Hill, I don't feel pain.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.222
So why'd they make a Bruce
Wayne look-alike anyhow?

23:36.258 --> 23:38.224
I don't know.

23:38.260 --> 23:40.593
I didn't even know I looked
like him until a few days ago.

23:40.645 --> 23:43.179
I went to his house thinking
he might have some answers

23:43.231 --> 23:45.181
about who I am.

23:45.233 --> 23:46.233
He didn't.

23:46.268 --> 23:48.184
So you ran off and pretended to be him.

23:48.236 --> 23:50.120
Why?

23:50.155 --> 23:52.155
You'll laugh.

23:52.190 --> 23:53.239
I doubt it.

23:53.275 --> 23:55.642
Neither of you has a sense of humor.

23:55.677 --> 23:57.360
When you came to see
him the other night,

23:57.412 --> 23:59.612
I was watching from the hall.

23:59.614 --> 24:01.581
I saw the way you looked at him.

24:01.616 --> 24:04.450
No one's ever looked at me like that.

24:04.452 --> 24:06.703
I wanted to know how it felt.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.454
You should have your eyes checked.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.124
I didn't look at him like anything.

24:11.126 --> 24:13.276
All I mean is that I've
never had a friend.

24:13.311 --> 24:16.763
I've never had anyone.

24:16.798 --> 24:20.934
You have no idea what it's like
to spend your whole life alone.

24:20.969 --> 24:23.803
You're actually better off.

24:23.855 --> 24:25.488
People are overrated.

24:25.524 --> 24:27.223
You don't believe that.

24:27.275 --> 24:30.293
My mom left before I could ride a bike.

24:30.328 --> 24:31.861
Never knew my dad.

24:31.897 --> 24:32.979
I had two friends.

24:32.981 --> 24:34.781
One ended up barbecued,

24:34.816 --> 24:36.933
and the other's at the
bottom of the river.

24:36.968 --> 24:39.068
What about Bruce Wayne?

24:39.120 --> 24:40.820
Forget about him.

24:40.872 --> 24:42.745
He's even more screwed-up than you.

24:43.408 --> 24:45.427
You're more normal than you think.

25:09.401 --> 25:11.351
Hey. You're up.

25:14.739 --> 25:16.489
What's going on?

25:16.524 --> 25:18.858
Barnes told me what
happened during the attack.

25:18.910 --> 25:20.326
Nothing happened.

25:20.362 --> 25:22.557
I heard the tape from the
interrogation room with Alice.

25:22.581 --> 25:24.030
Listen to me...

25:24.032 --> 25:25.309
Whatever Jervis is doing to you...

25:25.333 --> 25:26.666
You need to uncuff me.

25:27.615 --> 25:28.952
I can't do that.

25:31.773 --> 25:34.374
I don't know what I would do
if something happened to you.

25:36.678 --> 25:38.117
You'd be fine.

25:39.421 --> 25:41.047
Do you really believe that?

25:41.099 --> 25:43.466
You seemed to have moved on okay.

25:44.729 --> 25:47.053
Yes, I moved on, Jim.

25:47.105 --> 25:48.354
What choice did I have?

25:48.390 --> 25:49.689
I went through the most

25:49.724 --> 25:52.191
painful period of my life alone.

25:52.227 --> 25:54.527
I cried myself to sleep every night.

25:54.562 --> 25:58.314
And like an idiot, I would
wake up thinking, hoping that

25:58.366 --> 26:01.868
the next day, you would
show up at my door.

26:01.903 --> 26:03.486
But you never did.

26:04.912 --> 26:08.157
Mario was there for me
when I needed someone.

26:08.209 --> 26:12.829
He was there as I tried to
put myself back together.

26:12.881 --> 26:15.481
But I'm the one who doesn't care.

26:19.653 --> 26:22.255
After everything that's happened,

26:22.257 --> 26:24.173
you really have nothing to say to me?

26:29.431 --> 26:31.431
The past is the past.

26:31.483 --> 26:34.284
There's nothing I can do to change that.

26:39.190 --> 26:42.661
Alice told me that her brother
preys on anger and regret.

26:43.696 --> 26:46.195
I really don't want that to
be all that's left of us.

26:47.916 --> 26:50.867
You mean all that's left of me.

26:50.919 --> 26:54.203
Barnes asked me to put you
on a 48-hour suicide watch.

26:54.255 --> 26:56.273
I've already signed off on it.

26:58.460 --> 27:01.427
I know that we can't change the past,

27:01.463 --> 27:04.630
but there's a difference between
moving on and letting go.

27:07.102 --> 27:10.269
(door opens, closes)

27:13.308 --> 27:16.776
Most of you guys have
been with me for a while.

27:16.811 --> 27:18.561
You know me.

27:19.647 --> 27:20.780
And I know Gotham

27:20.815 --> 27:22.648
like the back of my hand.

27:22.701 --> 27:24.317
(laughter)

27:24.319 --> 27:26.302
Penguin,

27:26.338 --> 27:30.656
when he's mayor, boys, I promise you,

27:30.658 --> 27:34.660
we are gonna run this city, huh?

27:34.662 --> 27:36.662
- MAN: To Butch!
- ALL: To Butch!

27:36.715 --> 27:37.747
(cheering)

27:38.500 --> 27:39.499
I...

27:39.501 --> 27:40.917
What?

27:40.969 --> 27:42.919
I lost track of the guy in the glasses.

27:42.971 --> 27:44.003
Nygma?

27:44.005 --> 27:46.839
That skinny loon gave you the slip?!

27:46.841 --> 27:48.508
(phone ringing, vibrating)

27:48.560 --> 27:49.842
- (phone beeps)
- Yeah?

27:49.844 --> 27:51.978
No.

27:52.013 --> 27:55.014
No, no, that's not possible.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.015
Let's go!

27:56.067 --> 27:57.767
We got to go, guys! Come on!

28:03.691 --> 28:05.992
Two of your brothers are dead.

28:06.027 --> 28:09.295
The other two escaped
with Alice and Jervis.

28:09.330 --> 28:12.048
And I need to know where
they're taking her.

28:13.935 --> 28:15.585
(sniffs)

28:18.957 --> 28:21.507
Jervis gains a sister and
you lose two brothers?

28:21.543 --> 28:24.043
That don't seem too fair.

28:24.045 --> 28:26.028
Hmm?

28:26.064 --> 28:29.198
I bet you were close growing up, huh?

28:29.234 --> 28:32.552
Wrestling around the house,
driving your mom crazy.

28:32.554 --> 28:35.304
Five little kids all
dreaming of stardom.

28:35.356 --> 28:36.305
(sobbing softly)

28:36.357 --> 28:39.192
Yeah, I'm a fan.

28:39.227 --> 28:41.394
My dad used to always take me down

28:41.446 --> 28:43.563
to the rassling matches at the Garden.

28:44.465 --> 28:47.200
I also happen to know most luchadores...

28:48.570 --> 28:51.237
request to be buried in their masks

28:51.289 --> 28:53.039
as a sign of honor...

28:53.074 --> 28:54.040
(lighter clicks open)

28:54.075 --> 28:56.042
and respect.

28:56.077 --> 28:57.605
I really, really hope
that wasn't the case

28:57.629 --> 28:59.495
with your brothers.

28:59.547 --> 29:00.913
(whimpers)

29:00.965 --> 29:03.499
This freak Jervis did
something to my friend,

29:03.551 --> 29:05.635
and I need him to undo it.

29:05.670 --> 29:07.587
Where are they taking her?

29:10.592 --> 29:12.592
Okay, okay, I'll tell you!

29:28.576 --> 29:30.443
JERVIS: Well?

29:30.478 --> 29:33.212
You like it?

29:42.423 --> 29:45.291
I know you were surprised
to see me last night...

29:47.295 --> 29:50.179
and I want you to know
that I forgive you.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.733
For everything.

29:53.768 --> 29:56.052
But...

29:56.087 --> 29:59.889
I want you to understand consequences

29:59.941 --> 30:02.742
if you ever leave me again.

30:02.777 --> 30:08.164
I need you to understand
how important you are to me.

30:15.990 --> 30:17.990
Don't. Please.

30:18.042 --> 30:19.959
Now...

30:19.994 --> 30:21.827
you might feel

30:21.880 --> 30:24.163
a little prick.

30:24.165 --> 30:26.299
(needle injecting)

30:26.334 --> 30:29.335
(screaming)

30:50.976 --> 30:52.609
BULLOCK: Your escorts agreed

30:52.644 --> 30:53.977
to take a long lunch.

30:55.313 --> 30:57.981
- You know where they took Alice?
- Yeah.

30:58.033 --> 30:59.927
But it's only a matter of
time until Barnes finds out

30:59.951 --> 31:01.568
and sends in the cavalry.

31:01.620 --> 31:03.152
How'd you find me?

31:03.204 --> 31:04.904
Lee.

31:04.956 --> 31:06.906
- Lee?
- Yeah.

31:06.958 --> 31:08.074
She also told me

31:08.126 --> 31:10.410
if you check out on my
watch, it's my head.

31:10.462 --> 31:12.662
Guess you're gonna have to trust me.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.081
Remember to chisel
that into my tombstone.

31:16.134 --> 31:17.467
Let's go.

31:17.502 --> 31:19.218
Thanks, Francisco.

31:22.290 --> 31:23.473
(gate slides open)

31:23.508 --> 31:24.757
(footsteps approaching)

31:25.810 --> 31:27.360
Took you long enough.

31:27.395 --> 31:28.478
Where's Selina?

31:28.513 --> 31:29.712
She's not at her squat.

31:29.748 --> 31:31.125
- If you did anything...
- She's fine.

31:31.149 --> 31:33.182
- Where is she?
- She left a little while ago.

31:33.184 --> 31:34.634
I don't know where she went.

31:34.669 --> 31:36.185
I take you in and this
is the thanks I get?

31:36.187 --> 31:38.302
You run around with Selina,
pretending to be me?

31:38.353 --> 31:40.073
Is that why you're angry?

31:40.108 --> 31:41.452
Because I was pretending to be you

31:41.476 --> 31:43.026
or that I spent the day with Selina?

31:45.668 --> 31:46.946
For someone who has everything,

31:46.998 --> 31:49.749
you have no idea what you actually want.

31:51.036 --> 31:53.369
Or maybe you're just
too scared to take it.

31:53.371 --> 31:55.004
At least I know who I am.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.339
Cool your boots, Master Bruce.

31:56.374 --> 31:58.291
Let's all just take a breath, shall we?

31:58.343 --> 31:59.676
Don't worry.

31:59.711 --> 32:01.711
You won't be seeing me anymore.

32:01.746 --> 32:03.162
Neither will she.

32:03.198 --> 32:05.515
I don't know why I was created,

32:05.550 --> 32:08.551
but I know I don't belong in Gotham.

32:12.557 --> 32:14.546
Say good-bye to Selina for me.

32:17.562 --> 32:19.312
And thank her for the kiss.

32:43.138 --> 32:45.755
What are you going to use that for?

32:45.807 --> 32:48.891
Oh, I imagine I'll...

32:48.927 --> 32:50.977
mix it into

32:51.012 --> 32:53.112
some public drinking fountain.

32:53.148 --> 32:56.933
Create a few dozen monsters. (chuckles)

32:56.935 --> 32:58.518
Please, Jervis.

32:58.570 --> 32:59.919
Please.

32:59.954 --> 33:02.822
- I'll do whatever you want.
- You will now.

33:02.857 --> 33:04.157
Because you know the price

33:04.192 --> 33:07.326
other people will pay if you don't.

33:08.947 --> 33:12.031
I don't know what I would
ever do if I lost you.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.119
That connection.

33:16.121 --> 33:18.154
It keeps me sane.

33:19.758 --> 33:22.008
It always has.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.043
(gun cocks)

33:23.094 --> 33:24.127
Tetch?

33:24.129 --> 33:26.262
- Jervis?
- (chuckles)

33:26.297 --> 33:28.131
Don't move!

33:28.799 --> 33:33.352
Mr. Gordon. I can't say
I'm entirely surprised.

33:33.388 --> 33:34.937
So stubborn.

33:34.973 --> 33:37.306
- Let her go now.
- You know I can't do that.

33:37.308 --> 33:40.860
But if you let me leave

33:40.895 --> 33:42.195
with my dear sister,

33:42.230 --> 33:45.948
my dear Alice...

33:45.984 --> 33:50.536
then I'll free you from
that nasty little impulse.

33:50.572 --> 33:53.539
Maybe you can live a long, happy...

33:53.575 --> 33:56.325
Well, a long life.

34:00.131 --> 34:01.864
Let her go and you live.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.132
That's the deal.

34:04.335 --> 34:05.384
One question.

34:07.472 --> 34:09.472
(ticking)

34:13.645 --> 34:15.178
Do you hear that?

34:15.179 --> 34:17.597
(ticking continues)

34:23.688 --> 34:24.688
Jim!

34:29.994 --> 34:31.944
JERVIS: We both know
what you really want.

34:31.996 --> 34:34.746
I saw it in your eyes the first time

34:34.783 --> 34:36.449
we met.

34:36.501 --> 34:38.333
(echoing): You want to be free.

34:39.320 --> 34:41.370
Free from the pain.

34:43.675 --> 34:44.675
And you can be.

34:48.513 --> 34:50.129
<i>Stop fighting</i>

34:50.181 --> 34:51.880
and let go.

34:51.882 --> 34:55.117
(amplified heartbeat)

34:55.152 --> 34:57.353
GORDON: <i>The past is the past.</i>

34:57.388 --> 34:58.604
(heartbeat slows)

34:58.640 --> 35:00.240
<i>There's nothing I can do to change that.</i>

35:04.395 --> 35:06.729
THOMPKINS: <i>There's a difference
between moving on and letting go.</i>

35:06.731 --> 35:08.114
No!

35:18.743 --> 35:21.043
Well, well, Mr. Gordon breaks my spell!

35:21.079 --> 35:23.579
(Jervis laughs)

35:23.581 --> 35:25.748
I daresay it's time we bid
this foul city our good-bye.

35:25.800 --> 35:26.749
- ALICE: No!
- Alice!

35:26.751 --> 35:28.084
I'll never go with you!

35:28.086 --> 35:29.385
Why do you say such things?!

35:29.420 --> 35:31.721
We belong together. You know that.

35:31.756 --> 35:32.972
I love you.

35:33.007 --> 35:34.674
- You're insane!
- No, no!

35:34.726 --> 35:36.893
(screaming)

35:36.928 --> 35:38.477
- No!
- (squishing thud)

35:38.513 --> 35:41.347
(crying): No!

35:41.399 --> 35:44.100
You killed her!

36:04.572 --> 36:07.123
You want to explain yourself?

36:07.158 --> 36:09.042
I was following a lead.

36:09.077 --> 36:10.605
You were following some misguided notion

36:10.629 --> 36:11.828
about friendship.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.579
James Gordon is gonna get you killed

36:13.632 --> 36:15.915
one day, you get that?

36:15.967 --> 36:17.166
Maybe.

36:17.218 --> 36:18.584
But until that day,

36:18.586 --> 36:21.554
I will never turn my back on him.

36:29.931 --> 36:31.292
MAN (over TV): The
night that all of Gotham

36:31.316 --> 36:32.565
has been waiting for.

36:32.600 --> 36:34.078
The final results should
be coming in shortly.

36:34.102 --> 36:35.818
This is it.

36:35.854 --> 36:37.820
The moment I've been waiting for.

36:37.856 --> 36:38.988
Indeed.

36:39.024 --> 36:39.939
GILZEAN: You!

36:39.991 --> 36:41.941
You, you ruined everything!

36:41.993 --> 36:43.304
OSWALD: Butch, release him this instant!

36:43.328 --> 36:44.527
What is going on?!

36:44.579 --> 36:45.828
I'll tell you what's going on.

36:45.864 --> 36:47.330
He just cost you the election.

36:47.365 --> 36:49.449
He went to every district official

36:49.451 --> 36:50.583
and took the money back.

36:50.618 --> 36:52.669
Said you wanted to run a clean election.

36:52.704 --> 36:55.254
Tell me this is not true.

36:55.290 --> 36:57.674
I'm afraid Butch is right. For once.

36:57.709 --> 37:00.593
- (growls)
- Why?

37:00.628 --> 37:03.018
After everything I've done for you.

37:03.094 --> 37:05.478
Everything we could've done together.

37:05.513 --> 37:07.680
You betrayed me.

37:08.850 --> 37:09.850
Butch!

37:10.768 --> 37:11.934
(crowd gasping)

37:11.986 --> 37:13.402
Give me one reason why I shouldn't

37:13.438 --> 37:15.354
let Butch kill you where you stand.

37:15.406 --> 37:16.989
Well, there are about 30 witnesses...

37:17.024 --> 37:18.491
I don't care!

37:18.526 --> 37:19.692
(crowd cheering over TV)

37:19.744 --> 37:21.277
And there's that.

37:21.329 --> 37:22.840
WOMAN (over TV): In
what can only be viewed

37:22.864 --> 37:25.531
as a seismic shift even
by Gotham standards,

37:25.533 --> 37:28.751
former underworld
kingpin Oswald Cobblepot

37:28.786 --> 37:32.171
has won the mayor's
office by a landslide.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.756
(crowd cheering)

37:33.791 --> 37:35.424
(shushing)

37:35.460 --> 37:37.793
momentum based largely on
his outspoken criticism...

37:37.845 --> 37:39.345
I still won.

37:39.380 --> 37:42.131
Of how city officials and
the GCPD mishandled...

37:42.183 --> 37:44.683
They really want me as mayor.

37:44.719 --> 37:46.185
Yes.

37:48.556 --> 37:49.939
I can't be bought,

37:49.974 --> 37:52.654
but I can be stolen with one glance.

37:54.028 --> 37:57.446
I'm worthless to one,
but priceless to two.

37:59.066 --> 38:01.400
Love.

38:04.705 --> 38:06.739
CROWD (over TV, chanting):
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

38:06.791 --> 38:08.791
(laughs)

38:08.826 --> 38:11.127
They love me.

38:11.162 --> 38:12.661
If you would've bought the election,

38:12.713 --> 38:13.963
you would've never known.

38:13.998 --> 38:16.081
But now you do.

38:16.134 --> 38:17.199
(laughs)

38:17.235 --> 38:19.385
Feels good, doesn't it?

38:20.805 --> 38:22.505
How did you know I would win?

38:22.557 --> 38:25.591
I believe in you, Oswald.

38:25.593 --> 38:28.010
Even when you don't believe in yourself.

38:29.063 --> 38:30.513
(sniffles)

38:30.565 --> 38:32.765
You.

38:32.817 --> 38:34.984
You never believed I could
win this election on my own.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.487
I think maybe you're not
cut out for this after all.

38:38.523 --> 38:39.666
What?! You got to be kidding me.

38:39.690 --> 38:40.751
- This guy...
- Don't worry.

38:40.775 --> 38:43.108
I still need someone to crack skulls.

38:43.161 --> 38:44.610
(sniffles, laughs)

38:44.612 --> 38:45.945
Come, Ed.

38:45.997 --> 38:47.863
We have plans to make.

38:47.915 --> 38:49.448
(laughs)

38:49.500 --> 38:51.000
(Nygma chuckles)

38:57.542 --> 38:58.624
You think we'll ever see him again?

38:58.626 --> 39:00.626
Well, that I very much
doubt, Master Bruce.

39:00.628 --> 39:04.096
I reckon he's gonna try and
get as far away from Gotham

39:04.131 --> 39:05.131
as he possibly can.

39:05.183 --> 39:06.882
I still wonder why
Hugo Strange made him.

39:06.918 --> 39:08.133
Long lonely nights

39:08.186 --> 39:10.486
in the laboratory, but
wanted someone to talk to.

39:10.521 --> 39:14.857
Or some other nefarious reason.

39:14.892 --> 39:16.775
Perhaps.

39:21.315 --> 39:22.898
There is one thing.

39:22.950 --> 39:25.568
Yes, Master Bruce?

39:25.620 --> 39:28.537
Do you think Selina really kissed him?

39:28.573 --> 39:30.406
- Aw, bloody hell.
- I mean, you've had

39:30.458 --> 39:31.518
training in interrogation, right?

39:31.542 --> 39:33.158
You can tell when someone's lying.

39:33.211 --> 39:34.791
No, I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

39:34.815 --> 39:36.810
And if she did kiss him, do you
think she thought he was me?

39:36.834 --> 39:38.713
Good night, Master Bruce.

39:39.383 --> 39:41.450
I bet she thought he was me.

39:49.844 --> 39:51.310
THOMPKINS: Hey.

39:51.345 --> 39:52.895
Hey.

39:52.930 --> 39:54.847
You're here late.

39:54.899 --> 39:57.349
Tweeds really did a
number on this place.

39:57.351 --> 40:00.352
Guess I'm medical examiner-slash-medic.

40:00.404 --> 40:03.355
Slash-resident therapist.

40:04.859 --> 40:07.326
I wanted to thank you

40:07.361 --> 40:09.745
for telling Bullock where to find me.

40:09.780 --> 40:12.331
Heard about what happened
with Alice. You okay?

40:12.366 --> 40:14.116
- Yeah.
- No.

40:14.168 --> 40:15.534
I mean are <i> you</i> okay?

40:15.586 --> 40:18.254
(sighs) Whatever Jervis did to me...

40:18.289 --> 40:20.539
it's over now.

40:21.626 --> 40:23.042
I'm glad.

40:23.094 --> 40:24.877
Guess I should get going.

40:26.180 --> 40:27.180
Lee.

40:28.716 --> 40:31.767
There's something I... need to tell you.

40:31.802 --> 40:33.185
Something I should have told you

40:33.220 --> 40:35.137
the moment I saw you back in Gotham.

40:35.189 --> 40:37.356
Everything you said today...
I'm sorry about that.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.608
Don't...

40:39.644 --> 40:41.293
You were right.

40:41.329 --> 40:43.896
And after everything
that happened today...

40:47.485 --> 40:49.835
This is harder than I thought.

40:49.870 --> 40:52.237
What is it, Jim?

40:54.392 --> 40:56.408
I'm happy for you.

40:58.829 --> 41:00.546
You are?

41:00.581 --> 41:02.514
Trying to be.

41:03.968 --> 41:06.135
Maybe we can start there.

41:06.170 --> 41:07.920
Yeah.

41:07.972 --> 41:10.255
I think we can do that.

41:31.412 --> 41:33.112
Bruce Wayne?

41:34.115 --> 41:35.364
No.

41:35.416 --> 41:37.333
But you could be.

41:37.368 --> 41:39.952
In fact, you could be so much more.

41:40.004 --> 41:42.154
Who are you?

41:42.189 --> 41:44.873
You might think of us as your parents.

41:44.925 --> 41:49.011
We've been looking for
you for a long time.

41:53.851 --> 41:55.267
(door closes)

41:55.302 --> 41:58.103
It is with a humble heart

41:58.139 --> 42:01.890
that I accept the trust placed
in me by this great city

42:01.942 --> 42:04.360
to become your mayor.

42:04.395 --> 42:07.980
The people have spoken, and
I have heard their call.

42:07.982 --> 42:09.398
(crowd cheers)

42:09.450 --> 42:11.533
And as my first act as mayor,

42:11.569 --> 42:15.237
I would like to introduce
you to my chief of staff,

42:15.289 --> 42:18.424
Mr. Edward Nygma!

42:18.459 --> 42:20.309
(crowd cheering)

42:31.722 --> 42:34.006
(cheering continues)

42:37.261 --> 42:40.229
(indistinct police radio chatter)

42:40.264 --> 42:42.681
(siren wailing in distance)

43:04.705 --> 43:06.705
(quiet crackling)

43:09.260 --> 43:10.626
(gasps)

43:19.720 --> 43:21.887
No.
