01:22.615 --> 01:24.810
Turtle!
Aspirin, please.

01:24.851 --> 01:26.409
Please.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.512
You know, Vin, I don't think I've ever
seen you hung-over before.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.581
Half a bottle of Johnnie Walker
will take anyone down.

01:31.624 --> 01:34.024
Especially when you mix it
with half a bottle of vodka.

01:34.060 --> 01:35.925
Oh my God, did I?

01:35.962 --> 01:38.089
Drama kind of forced it
on you, but yeah you did.

01:38.131 --> 01:40.656
How's he doing?
Any sounds coming from in there?

01:40.700 --> 01:43.567
Last I heard, sounded like
someone torturing kittens.

01:43.603 --> 01:45.901
You know, it was
blah blaaah!

01:45.939 --> 01:48.373
Turtle, come on.
Please.

01:48.408 --> 01:49.966
We've got to help him
out today,

01:50.009 --> 01:52.034
get him together.
He's doing "The View."

01:52.078 --> 01:54.774
He can get some solid press
if he yaks all over Whoopi Goldberg.

01:56.749 --> 01:59.343
- Johnny!
- Come in.

01:59.385 --> 02:01.410
What's up, bro?

02:01.454 --> 02:03.183
A little hung-over.
You?

02:03.223 --> 02:06.021
Purged myself by sunrise.
I feel great.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.617
Thinking about wearing
a tank on the show

02:07.660 --> 02:09.150
so I'm getting
my arms yoked.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.595
- You all right, Drama?
- Yeah, great, E.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.293
I'm doing "The View" at Caesars.
Who wouldn't be great?

02:14.334 --> 02:15.699
Can see
you're not hung-over.

02:15.735 --> 02:17.669
Where's all the post-break-
up depression gone?

02:17.704 --> 02:19.763
Leave him alone, Turtle.
He looks great. Look at him.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.205
Yeah, maybe he
forgot about it.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.141
I haven't
forgotten shit.

02:23.176 --> 02:26.907
My heart's been broken into hundreds
and hundreds of tiny little pieces.

02:26.946 --> 02:28.675
But I'm doing
"The View" today.

02:28.715 --> 02:31.240
So I'm postponing
my depression until after I kill it.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.774
Love the attitude.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.219
You gonna love it live, bro?
Only a 45-minute flight.

02:35.255 --> 02:37.951
I wish I could, but I've got generals
with all the studio heads.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.482
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.587
Here, maybe you
should bulk up.

02:49.836 --> 02:52.396
So what do you
talk about in a general meeting anyway?

02:52.438 --> 02:53.871
General stuff,
I guess.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.704
Yeah, I guess.

02:55.742 --> 02:59.337
Would you look at this.
I didn't know he was coming. Did you?

02:59.379 --> 03:01.313
- Nope.
- Should I hit him?

03:01.347 --> 03:03.076
No, look, he's waving
a white flag.

03:05.385 --> 03:07.216
Guess who read the script.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.414
Which script?
The one we told you to read last week?

03:09.455 --> 03:11.753
That's right.
And it is good. It's very good.

03:11.791 --> 03:12.917
Yeah, we told you
that last week.

03:12.959 --> 03:15.223
Right, listen, and it is perfect
timing for us.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.285
How is it perfect timing?

03:16.329 --> 03:18.229
Because we have general
meetings all week, right?

03:18.264 --> 03:20.255
And there's nothing greater
in life than having something

03:20.300 --> 03:21.995
specific to say
at a general.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.525
And what specifically
do we have to say?

03:23.570 --> 03:25.231
That we want to do
"Smokejumpers."

03:25.271 --> 03:27.831
- But Ed Norton already wants to do it.
- Does he?

03:27.874 --> 03:30.206
Yeah, he does.
All because you didn't read the script.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.473
I didn't read the script
because you didn't pitch it well.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.309
You really gonna try to
blame this on me, Ari?

03:34.347 --> 03:36.474
Yes, I'm gonna
fucking blame you for it.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.643
You said it was an indie.
You said it was small.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.653
Small people think small,
so I can't totally blame you for that.

03:40.687 --> 03:43.884
But anyone with half a sense of the
business would have read it and known,

03:43.923 --> 03:46.118
okay, you got a script
that's well-written

03:46.159 --> 03:47.888
about the greatest fire
in Oregon history

03:47.927 --> 03:49.792
for 90 pages
and you never see it.

03:49.829 --> 03:52.320
Live inside
that fire for 50 pages,

03:52.365 --> 03:53.992
boom, home run.

03:54.033 --> 03:56.729
Well, boom, now it's Ed Norton's
home run, you jerk-off.

03:56.769 --> 03:58.794
Well, did they sell
the script, you cunt face?

03:58.838 --> 04:00.169
Not yet, dick head.

04:00.206 --> 04:02.766
Then it's still free,
you overpaid undersized bitch.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.437
You want a go, Ari?
Seriously, let's just go right here.

04:05.478 --> 04:08.447
You've never been hit in the face with
anything besides a cock and you know it.

04:09.515 --> 04:11.745
I already told Amanda she
has the script exclusively.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.344
Then tell her she doesn't.
Or don't, it's not our concern.

04:14.387 --> 04:17.322
Ari, I don't want to
put E in a tough spot.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.620
A tough spot?
He reps the writers.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.992
Two buyers will only increase
the price for his clients.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.758
He's right.
He's right.

04:24.797 --> 04:26.856
I did tell you guys
you could have the script first.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.566
This is Amanda right here.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.160
Listen, ignore it.
Come on, Vinnie.

04:31.204 --> 04:32.694
- Hey, Amanda.
- Morning, E.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.435
Great news.
Ed's company wants to buy the script.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.806
Ed Norton's company
wants to buy the script.

04:36.843 --> 04:37.867
How much?

04:37.910 --> 04:39.673
- For how much?
- 100 against 300,

04:39.712 --> 04:41.202
which is a great deal
for first-time writers.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.613
- 100 against 300.
- We can do better.

04:43.650 --> 04:46.141
- E, you there?
- Yeah, I'm here. I'm here.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.846
What do you think?

04:47.887 --> 04:50.151
I think I should probably talk to my clients
first to see what they think.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.555
- Okay, call me back.
- All right, thanks, Amanda.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.924
- Now there's an offer.
- I can top it.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.485
Let's go, Vinnie.

04:56.529 --> 04:59.225
- I'm sorry, Vince.
- You have no reason to be.

04:59.265 --> 05:01.165
You do what you have to do.
I understand, really.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.168
Thanks, buddy.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.706
You're not wearing a tank top and fucking
shorts on "The View," Drama.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.072
Who do you think you are,
Richard Simmons?

05:10.109 --> 05:11.303
Only gayer.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.107
You know, I expect
that from him.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.172
You're my publicist who I now employ.
So do your job.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.445
What's your problem, Drama?
Still broken-hearted?

05:18.484 --> 05:20.179
- Oh yeah, oh yeah.
- Shut up, Turtle.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.244
I'm sorry, Drama,
but it's affecting all of us.

05:22.288 --> 05:25.587
- You slept with my dog last night.
- I was lonely.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.923
You're not gonna embarrass yourself on
"The View," are you, Drama?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.019
I'm gonna be fine
on the show.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.497
It's when I get home
I may have some issues.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.965
Look, your real life
is your problem,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.264
your public perception is mine.
So keep it together.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.361
Please,
I'm a professional.

05:38.404 --> 05:40.895
You don't even have to
worry about that.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.500
- Hey, Drama!
- What's up, castmates?

05:43.543 --> 05:45.511
- What's up?
- What's up, dude?

05:45.545 --> 05:48.446
- Did you bring your girl?
- Uh, no.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.472
We thought you said
she might be flying in.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.916
Yeah, she was gonna,
but no, she didn't.

05:52.952 --> 05:55.887
Damn, we were dying
to meet her, man.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.651
Yeah.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.658
I don't think you met
my girlfriend Sophia, right?

05:59.692 --> 06:03.219
Uh, no.
I don't believe so. Hi.

06:03.262 --> 06:05.560
So you all brought
your girlfriends, huh?

06:05.598 --> 06:07.896
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:14.273 --> 06:15.968
You okay, Drama?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.402
I'm a rock.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.713
$100,000?
That is unreal. You did it, E.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.311
That's just
the first offer.

06:28.354 --> 06:30.185
It's not 100,
it's 100 against 300.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.850
Against?
What does that mean, against?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.756
It means if the movie gets
made you get another 200.

06:33.793 --> 06:36.261
If it gets made? Why wouldn't it get made?
We got Ed Norton.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.263
It doesn't always
work like that.

06:38.297 --> 06:40.231
Why would they buy it
if they don't want to make it?

06:40.266 --> 06:42.200
- They do want to make it.
- What's he saying?

06:42.235 --> 06:45.602
I don't know. Ed Norton wants it
but they may not make it.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.265
Vince wants it
but they may not buy it.

06:47.306 --> 06:49.365
- It all sounds fishy to me.
- Give me the phone.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.707
- E, Nick here.
- Hey, Nick.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.768
Yeah, so what's going on?

06:52.812 --> 06:54.245
Trying to sell your script
just like you asked.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.373
So there's no time to screw around,
'cause there's lots happening.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.613
Yeah, well say it succinctly then and tell
me exactly what's going on.

06:59.652 --> 07:02.519
Vince is out trying to sell the studios
and we have a first offer

07:02.555 --> 07:04.648
from Ed Norton's company
that I'd like to try to get more out of.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.022
Yeah, well how much more
do you think we can get?

07:07.059 --> 07:09.118
- I don't know.
- Isn't it your job to know?

07:09.162 --> 07:12.063
- Nick.
- If Ed Norton wants to do it

07:12.098 --> 07:14.794
and Vincent Chase wants to do it, seems
like we can play them against each other

07:14.834 --> 07:16.392
and start a little
bidding war here.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.563
Yeah, well let's not
jump ahead of ourselves.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.129
Look, I read about this shit
all the time in "Variety."

07:21.174 --> 07:23.301
All right?
Just raise the price and get a guarantee

07:23.342 --> 07:25.810
- that our movie gets made.
- It'll never happen.

07:25.845 --> 07:27.972
500 Gs and a guarantee
that the movie gets made.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.175
Nick, it'll never happen.

07:30.216 --> 07:33.151
Well, it seems like everybody in that town
of yours loves our script, right?

07:33.186 --> 07:35.211
So guess what?
You make it happen.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.514
So you're thinking of this
as a big movie?

07:38.558 --> 07:40.219
Huge, Steve.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.751
The fire in this is gonna make "Backdraft"
look like a fucking campfire.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.765
- Excuse my language.
- That's interesting. Interesting.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.427
- Yeah. How interesting?
- Interesting enough to buy?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.767
You know, Vince, I don't know
if it's that interesting.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.829
But you know what
does interest me?

07:53.873 --> 07:55.670
Benji.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.309
The dog?

07:59.345 --> 08:01.142
We're taking him
to Alaska.

08:04.016 --> 08:06.849
At least we got the president of the studio
doing business with us, right?

08:06.886 --> 08:09.047
- About Benji?
- It's a cute dog, right?

08:09.088 --> 08:10.612
Yeah, maybe it'll be
a good script.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.214
You bet your ass
it'll be a good script.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.725
And I'm gonna make sure
they have Miss Alaska

08:13.759 --> 08:16.057
waiting in your trailer
to blow you at all times.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.585
- Thanks, Ari.
- How'd it go?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.120
Great.
How'd it go with your writers?

08:19.165 --> 08:21.725
They want 500 Gs and a guarantee that
the movie gets made.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.826
Sound like a bunch of idiots.
Perfect clients for you, E.

08:23.870 --> 08:24.962
Thank you.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.165
- Yeah, Lloyd?
- Steve Parles calling.

08:27.206 --> 08:29.197
Steve Parles.
Put him through.

08:29.242 --> 08:30.869
- Steve, hey.
- Ari.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.640
Yeah, Vince wants to go
to the Arctic Circle with you and Benji

08:33.679 --> 08:36.113
but he wants 10 million
plus first dollar

08:36.148 --> 08:39.379
- and a five-star igloo.
- Ari, I'm calling about "Smokejumpers."

08:39.418 --> 08:41.010
Really?

08:41.053 --> 08:43.214
Yeah, I couldn't say this
in front of Vince out of respect for him

08:43.256 --> 08:45.053
but I want to buy
that script.

08:45.091 --> 08:46.956
Really?

08:46.993 --> 08:48.858
But not with Vince
attached.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.556
The script only comes
with Vince attached.

08:53.599 --> 08:56.397
I'll pay 350. And how about I toss
Vince an EP credit

08:56.435 --> 08:57.868
and 50 Gs
because I like him?

08:57.904 --> 08:59.701
EP credit?
What the fuck?

08:59.739 --> 09:02.469
Listen, he is a movie star,
not a no-show producer.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.976
Come on, Ari.
Does Vince even own the script?

09:05.011 --> 09:06.569
Consider it
as if he does.

09:06.612 --> 09:08.409
- Yeah, who reps it?
- Who knows?

09:08.447 --> 09:10.438
And who are the writers?
There's no cover page.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.973
- Listen, Steve.
- Ari.

09:12.018 --> 09:14.748
- Steve!
- Who are the fucking writers, Ari?

09:14.787 --> 09:16.414
Could be Gaghan.
Could be Zaillian.

09:16.455 --> 09:18.423
Could be Bill fucking Shakespeare.
I'll never tell.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.049
Stop acting like a child.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.925
Vince starred in
the highest-grossing movie of all time.

09:22.962 --> 09:24.691
You know that he can
carry this movie.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.595
I love Vince, Ari.
You know that.

09:26.632 --> 09:28.099
I just can't risk it
right now.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.931
I can't sell you
the script then, Steve.

09:29.969 --> 09:31.698
- Ari, come on.
- I'm sorry.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.762
Go fuck yourself.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.172
All right.
That sounds awesome.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.005
Okay.
All right, buddy.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.312
- What happened?
- What did he say?

09:41.347 --> 09:42.837
We're just gonna
keep plugging away.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.043
Come on, Ari.
I can take it.

09:46.586 --> 09:50.113
He said that he'll pay
350 for the script...

09:50.156 --> 09:52.317
without you.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.192
Jesus.
What do you want me to do?

09:57.229 --> 09:59.789
Sell it.
Take care of your writers.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.265
No no no no.
Do not sell it.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.325
We still have
five meetings left, all right?

10:03.369 --> 10:05.496
And we now have a bidding war
which you can use to stall.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.870
So stall. I will sell this
for you, Vinnie.

10:07.907 --> 10:09.602
Okay, look, I've got to
go deal with Amanda.

10:09.642 --> 10:11.507
It's okay, you go ahead.
I'll roll with Ari.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.206
All right. And we will
return from the war heroes, Vinnie.

10:14.246 --> 10:15.304
I promise you.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.679
Hey, Ari, I don't have
Steve Parles's number.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.946
You just heard the offer
from me, Dopey.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.215
What, do you need a certified letter
from him to work over Amanda?

10:21.253 --> 10:23.187
Just do it.

10:23.222 --> 10:24.985
Thank you.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.049
But still, I have to say
your character Quinn

10:27.093 --> 10:29.459
is one we don't really
know that much about yet.

10:29.495 --> 10:31.656
Are you saying I don't get
enough screen time?

10:31.697 --> 10:33.289
No, we see plenty of you.

10:33.332 --> 10:36.495
- Too much.
- Asshole.

10:36.535 --> 10:39.595
But you are the tough guy with no girl.
What's that?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.233
Think they'll ever give you
a relationship on the show?

10:42.274 --> 10:44.071
I think they'd like
to leave it unseen.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.011
Like I basically have a stable
of women around town.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.604
Is that how it is
in real life?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.445
Well...

10:50.483 --> 10:52.144
Or are you more of
a one-woman type guy?

10:52.184 --> 10:53.947
He's more of
a no-woman guy.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.756
So, Johnny, is there anything
you want to share with us?

10:58.791 --> 11:02.022
He just got dumped.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.688
Drama's gonna hit
this kid.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.697
I didn't get dumped.
Take it easy, Brandon.

11:05.731 --> 11:09.667
Okay, you didn't get dumped.
So tell us what happened.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.602
Give us a little Dr. Phil
moment or something.

11:11.637 --> 11:14.697
Sorry, Whoopi,
no moment to be had.

11:14.740 --> 11:17.709
It's just tough
for a celebrity

11:17.743 --> 11:19.506
to date
a civilian is all.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.308
They don't get
the lifestyle.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.214
And inevitably you have no choice
but to cut them loose.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.717
Don't believe him.
He's devastated.

11:25.751 --> 11:29.050
He's got pictures
of this girl wallpapering his trailer.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.318
Enough, Brandon.
I'm not playing.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.848
Wow, Johnny,
you really are the muscle.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.656
Come on, Johnny.
Just tell us what really happened.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.255
We're here for you.
Everyone wants to know, right?

11:38.297 --> 11:40.458
Yeah.

11:40.499 --> 11:42.399
No.

11:44.937 --> 11:48.304
I was a little possessive, I suppose,
so she ended it. It's no big thing.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.205
I thought you said
you ended it.

11:50.242 --> 11:52.767
- Yeah, well, it was mutual.
- Ah, okay.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.211
- We both had our reasons.
- Right, cool.

11:54.246 --> 11:56.077
- I'm fine.
- He's not fine.

11:56.115 --> 11:59.448
Well, look, in case
she's watching,

11:59.485 --> 12:01.919
why don't you use
this forum

12:01.954 --> 12:04.422
to tell her...
what's her name?

12:04.457 --> 12:06.015
- Jacqueline.
- Jacqueline.

12:06.058 --> 12:09.084
Tell Jacqueline how you feel
and what you're thinking.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.722
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't think so.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.891
- Come on, Johnny.
- I'd rather not.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.560
Come on, Johnny.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.331
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.736
You know what?
Brandon was kind enough

12:20.773 --> 12:23.241
to bring a picture
of Jacqueline here.

12:23.275 --> 12:25.709
- We have a photo. There she is.
- This is a setup?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.975
- Isn't she lovely?
- She's cute.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.038
Come on, why don't you
talk to her, John?

12:30.082 --> 12:31.640
Right there,
talk to her.

12:33.419 --> 12:36.718
Hey, baby.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.487
I just want to say
I'm sorry I was a little overprotective.

12:42.094 --> 12:44.961
And I miss you.

12:44.997 --> 12:48.433
I miss hearing your voice.
I miss hearing you laugh.

12:48.467 --> 12:51.493
- This is horrifying.
- Don't fucking cry.

12:51.537 --> 12:52.868
- I love you, baby.
- Jesus.

12:52.905 --> 12:56.170
I miss you being the last
thing I say good night to.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.274
I just want to say
I love you, baby.

12:59.311 --> 13:01.609
Tweet.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.243
Tweet?

13:05.284 --> 13:07.548
What is tweet?

13:07.586 --> 13:09.349
It's just something
we say.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.720
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.055
Fuck!

13:15.828 --> 13:16.920
Johnny!

13:16.962 --> 13:18.293
He would have been better
off yakking on them.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.491
- Let's go. Fuck this.
- Disaster.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.832
- Will you calm down?
- Don't you dare tell me to calm down.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.427
You said I had
this exclusively.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.234
I told you that I gave it
to Vince first.

13:27.273 --> 13:29.639
- And Vince changed his mind.
- Fuck Vince and fuck Ari.

13:29.675 --> 13:32.303
I put my ass on the line and gave it to
Edward fucking Norton.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.871
Wow. I've never heard you
curse before, Amanda.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.743
Just tell me
what you want.

13:40.786 --> 13:42.515
Look, I'm being as upfront
with you as I possibly can.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.581
My writers want 500 Gs
and a guarantee that the movie gets made.

13:45.624 --> 13:47.455
- That's ridiculous.
- I told them that.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.653
But that's what they want.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.457
And Steve Parles is gonna
give them that?

13:50.496 --> 13:51.986
He's getting closer.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.226
With Vince starring?

13:55.334 --> 13:56.767
Ahem.
Where's he at?

13:56.802 --> 13:58.497
Come on.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.164
So now you're coy?

14:00.206 --> 14:02.538
One second you're Honest Abe
with little rosy cheeks,

14:02.575 --> 14:04.202
the next you can't let your
slippery little tongue...

14:04.243 --> 14:06.438
I don't want to be
abused, Amanda.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.969
Look, Edward wants
this project.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.676
But he is buying it without a studio
and he wants it at a price.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.617
How much is he gonna get paid
if the movie gets made?

14:13.652 --> 14:15.847
- How is that relevant?
- If he's gonna get his quote...

14:15.888 --> 14:18.288
If he's gonna get his quote what?
Your writers should get theirs?

14:18.324 --> 14:20.485
E, your writers
don't have a quote.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.050
Your writers don't have
a pot to piss in.

14:22.094 --> 14:24.358
Edward Norton is an
Academy Award nominee

14:24.396 --> 14:25.954
who wants to take
their very raw script

14:25.998 --> 14:27.556
and turn it into
something special.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.068
If you want to go and sell it to
the first person

14:30.102 --> 14:32.229
with deep pockets for Vincent Chase,
be my guest.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.863
It'll be a piece of shit like the last
movie you guys made.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.739
Wow. You're a cold
bitch, huh?

14:36.775 --> 14:39.403
But here are the facts:
I've got a better offer.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.208
You've got a conflict
of interest

14:41.247 --> 14:43.181
because you represent Ed
and you're trying to sell the script.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.580
But you lowballed us
and you know it.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.585
So take it back to Ed
and tell him what we want.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.315
The whole naivete thing
is just an act, isn't it?

14:49.355 --> 14:51.755
You know just a little more
than you let on.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.382
Well, know this:

14:53.425 --> 14:56.394
Edward Norton is not getting
into a bidding war.

14:56.428 --> 14:58.157
- Amanda.
- We're out.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.688
- Amanda.
- Fuck off.

15:03.269 --> 15:04.896
You know the respect
we have for you.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.700
We did "Head On"
together.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.230
It was great for you and it
was great for us, okay?

15:09.275 --> 15:12.904
This movie is too expensive
for us to finance with you in the lead.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.936
I totally understand, Tom,
and I appreciate the honesty.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.881
- Thank you.
- I actually would prefer if you lied to us,

15:17.917 --> 15:20.317
like every other dick head in this town,
but very refreshing.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.252
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.779
- Listen to me. You'll be back, buddy.
- Tom, thank you.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.519
This is not forever, right?
You'll be back.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.686
Once a star
always a threat, buddy.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.286
- Good to see you.
- All right, man.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.922
- Thank you so much, Tom.
- Thanks, Ari.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.559
0 for seven.
That can't be good.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.637
- Wow.
- What?

15:40.673 --> 15:43.608
It's so bad
you can't even spin it?

15:43.642 --> 15:45.473
Try and spin it, Ari.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.604
It will turn for us,
I promise you.

15:47.646 --> 15:50.171
- No spinning.
- We have to make it turn.

15:50.215 --> 15:52.775
I am trying.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.843
- Have you read the script?
- Which one?

15:54.887 --> 15:57.617
- "Smokejumpers."
- Yes, I told you I read it.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.181
Most of it.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.352
You know the part of Ray?

16:02.394 --> 16:04.259
The brother.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.423
It's a good part.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.830
It's not the lead.

16:07.866 --> 16:10.266
I'm not getting leads.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.167
It's a good part
in a good movie.

16:12.204 --> 16:14.195
It'd be good for me to be
part of a good movie, right?

16:18.844 --> 16:20.675
That was so
fucking humiliating.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.079
I can't believe the girls of "The View"
would set him up like that.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.878
- Sneaky bitches.
- They said they won't cut it?

16:24.917 --> 16:28.114
Damage done.
It already aired on the East Coast.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.882
Women will probably
love it though.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.356
I don't care about "The View"'s audience.
I care about Drama's.

16:32.391 --> 16:34.985
If you don't think that all those women
watching the show

16:35.027 --> 16:38.121
are gonna tell their teenage kids that he's
a fucking pussy, you're crazy.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.926
At least it wasn't Vince.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.934
He should be so fucking lucky.
Get in.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.833
Hey, buddy.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.132
Too late to cut
your meltdown, Drama.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.107
Who gives a shit?

16:50.142 --> 16:52.337
It was from the heart.
It was truthful.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.642
Oh Jesus, Drama.
How many bottles is that?

16:56.482 --> 16:58.848
I lost count
shortly after takeoff.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.613
- Oh Christ. Let's get him home.
- Why?

17:00.652 --> 17:04.417
What is there for me there, Shauna?
I got no girl, no love.

17:04.455 --> 17:07.185
- I got nothing.
- Drama.

17:07.226 --> 17:09.626
When I came into this world
I had nothing.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.891
Now I'm right back to it.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.125
I left everything
I had up on that stage

17:14.165 --> 17:16.066
except the clothes
on my back.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.432
Maybe you should have
left those too.

17:17.469 --> 17:19.334
It would have been
far more interesting.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.236
Maybe I should have.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.637
Maybe I will.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.734
Oh Jesus Christ, Drama.
Keep your clothes on.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.078
- Hey hey, what are you doing?
- What the fuck?

17:30.115 --> 17:33.016
- I got nothing!
- Oh God.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.383
Would you get
back in the car?

17:34.420 --> 17:35.978
Do you hear me, world?

17:36.021 --> 17:38.421
Mr. Chase, please
get back in the car.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.084
I got nothing, world!

17:40.125 --> 17:42.093
Drama!

17:44.363 --> 17:46.297
Here, take my pants.

17:46.331 --> 17:47.730
Oh Jesus.
Get in the fucking car.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.402
Oh my God.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.560
- Hey, E.
- Hey, Lloyd.

17:52.604 --> 17:54.128
- Did you see Johnny on "The View"?
- How was it?

17:54.173 --> 17:56.300
Interesting.

17:56.341 --> 17:57.740
You looked stressed, E.
What's the matter?

17:57.776 --> 17:59.334
Amanda playing too
rough for you?

17:59.378 --> 18:01.369
'Cause I can call her and tell her to pick on
someone her own size.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.574
I lost Ed Norton.
Please tell me you got something.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.344
You lost Ed Norton?

18:05.384 --> 18:07.477
I actually overestimated
your negotiating skills.

18:07.519 --> 18:09.783
- Ari.
- No, he's right. He's right, I screwed up.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.585
I didn't set
my clients straight.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.056
Please tell me
you guys did better.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.253
Yeah, we did better.
We did a whole lot better.

18:15.294 --> 18:16.625
You got an offer?

18:16.662 --> 18:18.459
500 Gs from Steve Parles

18:18.497 --> 18:20.089
for your writers
just like you wanted.

18:20.132 --> 18:22.293
- Really?
- Yup. And Vince is in.

18:22.334 --> 18:25.132
- And Vince is in?
- Playing the brother Ray.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.797
You're not gonna
be the lead?

18:26.839 --> 18:29.069
- Nope.
- You okay with that?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.008
- It was his idea.
- It's a great role.

18:31.043 --> 18:34.206
- It's gonna be a great movie.
- Is it okay for him, Ari?

18:34.246 --> 18:35.611
It's what's necessary
right now.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.410
- And we got you the 500 Gs.
- Yup.

18:37.449 --> 18:39.644
Wow, this is unbelievable.
It really is.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.153
Say "Thank you, Ari."

18:42.187 --> 18:44.815
Come on.
Say "Thank you, Ari."

18:44.857 --> 18:46.882
- Thank you, Ari. I appreciate it.
- Come here. There you go.

18:46.925 --> 18:48.483
- I love it.
- Aw.

18:48.527 --> 18:50.324
Ha ha!

18:50.362 --> 18:52.557
Thanks, Vince.

18:52.598 --> 18:55.226
It's actually my writers
right here.

18:55.267 --> 18:57.292
- Tell them the good news.
- Think Jed and Clevis will go for it?

18:57.336 --> 19:00.328
- Or are they gonna want to direct now too?
- Nick.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.897
Where've you been, E?
We've been waiting on pins and needles.

19:02.941 --> 19:05.068
- LB.
- I mean, you don't answer your phone.

19:05.110 --> 19:08.011
I sent you like 25 emails.
What are we paying you for?

19:08.046 --> 19:10.412
- I got you your offer.
- He got us an offer.

19:10.449 --> 19:13.145
500,000 just like you wanted and Vince
is gonna play the second lead.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.779
- I think I love you, E.
- What's he saying? What's he saying?

19:15.821 --> 19:19.222
Vince and Ed Norton
and 500 Gs.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.522
Oh my God!

19:21.560 --> 19:24.256
Uh, no Ed Norton.
Ed Norton's out.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.787
- Ed Norton's out.
- Wait, why is Ed Norton out?

19:26.832 --> 19:28.390
Why is Ed Norton out?

19:28.433 --> 19:31.027
E, Nick here.
Why is Ed Norton out?

19:31.069 --> 19:33.196
His people didn't want
to get into a bidding war

19:33.238 --> 19:35.263
and sometimes
you just can't push.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.571
Yeah, but don't we pay you to know how
hard to push? I mean, come on.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.407
You haven't paid me anything yet, Nick,
and I just made you half a million dollars.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.106
I know, I know.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.377
But, you know, we got all
amped on Ed Norton today.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.247
We watched his movie, uh...

19:46.285 --> 19:49.254
- He was so great in "American History X."
- "American History X."

19:49.288 --> 19:51.119
I mean, the guy can act.
He's a good actor.

19:51.156 --> 19:54.785
Yeah, he is. And so is Vince and he's
the one you initially wanted, so...

19:54.826 --> 19:57.294
Actually, that letter that we sent you
we sent to pretty much everybody.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.819
You were just the only one
that responded.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.661
Are you happy?

20:03.001 --> 20:06.095
Nick, come on.
Today you live with your mother,

20:06.138 --> 20:08.072
tomorrow you don't have to.
Tell me you're happy.

20:08.106 --> 20:10.006
Yeah, I'm happy.
I'm happy.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.374
I just... you know, Ed Norton.
I mean...

20:12.411 --> 20:14.038
I'm accepting the deal.
Say thank you.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.107
Okay, thank you, E.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.209
Thank you.
Here, say thank you.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.379
Thank you, E.

20:22.421 --> 20:24.651
All right, you're welcome.
I'll talk to you later. Done deal.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.056
All right, we'll call them in the morning.
Good news, Lloyd.

20:27.092 --> 20:30.186
Vince will have a new movie poster
for you to whack off to soon.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.890
Oh, that's great news.
Congrats, Vince.

20:31.930 --> 20:34.592
But Turtle's on the phone. He says neither
of you will pick up your cells.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.363
- My ringer's off. What's up?
- It's Drama.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.427
What about him?

20:39.471 --> 20:41.268
Victory!

20:41.306 --> 20:43.240
Whoo!

20:43.275 --> 20:46.039
Your target demographic.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.239
You all right,
Johnny?

20:48.280 --> 20:50.248
Another incarceration
on my record.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.251
But at least I'm reminded
of the soothing touch

20:53.285 --> 20:54.718
of a beautiful woman.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.516
- He's all yours.
- Thank you.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.284
When am I gonna see you
in a new movie, Vince?

20:58.323 --> 20:59.449
Pretty soon, I think.

20:59.491 --> 21:00.958
One brother getting out
of movie-star jail

21:00.993 --> 21:02.290
the other one just
getting out of jail.

21:02.327 --> 21:05.023
- You got a movie, bro?
- Looks like it.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.463
There is justice
in this world.

21:07.499 --> 21:09.524
There is more than that,
Johnny Drama.

21:09.568 --> 21:11.502
I've spoken to many
of my friends today

21:11.536 --> 21:13.367
and they loved your
performance on "The View."

21:13.405 --> 21:16.067
Think they'll love whacking it
to his mug shot as well, Lloyd?

21:16.108 --> 21:17.439
Great image, Shauna.
Nice.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.704
Can we got to Villa, bro?

21:18.744 --> 21:20.769
I need to drown my sorrows
in some pussy.

21:20.812 --> 21:23.212
You got it.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.978
My favorite female agent.
How are you?

21:26.018 --> 21:27.542
Let's stick
to business, Eric.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.281
Do we have any business
to stick to?

21:29.321 --> 21:31.812
Edward's back in and he's
bringing a studio with him.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.950
I'm about to make
a deal, Amanda.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.825
The offer's $1 million against
$2 million for the script.

21:36.862 --> 21:39.194
- Wow.
- What is it?

21:39.231 --> 21:41.062
I need Vince
in the second lead.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.124
What?

21:43.168 --> 21:45.500
Vince is Ray the brother
or I can't close.

21:45.537 --> 21:47.835
Alan Gray is buying it, E.

21:47.873 --> 21:51.172
Not sure how your relationship is with him
since he fired Vince off "Aquaman."

21:51.209 --> 21:52.870
But you can call.

21:52.911 --> 21:56.142
In the meantime call your writers and tell
them they have Edward Norton

21:56.181 --> 21:57.910
and a $2 million offer.

21:57.949 --> 21:59.814
I'm sure they'll
want to close.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.251
Ahem.

22:04.756 --> 22:06.189
What did she say?

22:07.305 --> 22:13.858
