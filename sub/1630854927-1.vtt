00:11.707 --> 00:13.883
Mom!

00:30.117 --> 00:32.380
Lauren!

00:32.509 --> 00:33.859
Lauren!

00:33.946 --> 00:35.731
- Mom!
- Lauren!

00:35.861 --> 00:36.906
Lauren!

00:59.885 --> 01:01.800
Lauren?

01:01.931 --> 01:04.498
Honey, are you awake?

01:34.529 --> 01:37.140
Hey.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.621
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

01:39.751 --> 01:42.319
I just...

01:42.450 --> 01:45.583
I don't know how long
I can take it anymore.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.933
When can I finally see you?

02:01.643 --> 02:03.253
Are you kidding me?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.560
Sweet Rose has
the best ice cream for sure.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.562
Are you crazy, Lauren?

02:07.649 --> 02:09.738
You and dad only like
Sweet Rose

02:09.868 --> 02:11.435
because they had that
gross pickle-flavored ice cream.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.785
What was it called?

02:13.916 --> 02:17.485
-Number 23. The Big Dill.
-Ew.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.139
Okay,
don't be hating just because

02:19.226 --> 02:20.966
you have basic taste,
Miss Vanilla.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.882
Ah!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.541
Ouch.

02:30.672 --> 02:32.674
Lauren, be careful.

02:32.804 --> 02:33.849
Okay. Sorry.

02:33.978 --> 02:36.329
It's not my fault
you're so tender-headed.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.070
Okay, my scalp
was just out of practice.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.550
I mean, Mom's too busy,

02:39.680 --> 02:41.161
and there's not
a braiding shop for, like,

02:41.291 --> 02:44.120
a hundred miles
of this lame town.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.382
You still not vibing
with Blue Valley?

02:45.513 --> 02:49.038
Um, I'm not in college
having fun like you are.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.084
I'm stuck here with Mom,
and all I do is school,

02:52.215 --> 02:55.305
homework, and sleep
like a little no-fun robot.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.525
You haven't made any friends?

02:57.655 --> 02:59.004
With who?

02:59.091 --> 03:04.967
The meatheads or Future Farmers
at Blue Valley High?

03:05.054 --> 03:07.578
You have to try, Marley.

03:07.665 --> 03:12.103
Trust me, it gets worse
if you isolate yourself.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.247
Who is spamming your phone?

03:24.334 --> 03:27.424
Is it a secret boyfriend?
Maybe a sworn mortal enemy?

03:27.555 --> 03:30.732
Girl, mind your business.
It is no one, okay?

03:34.605 --> 03:38.174
Lauren, you don't have to hide
anything from me, you know?

03:38.305 --> 03:40.611
I just want
to make sure you're okay.

03:40.698 --> 03:44.659
Hey, I'mthe big sister.

03:44.746 --> 03:47.749
Supposed to worry about
if you're okay, not vice versa.

03:47.836 --> 03:48.924
Okay, Peanut?

03:49.054 --> 03:52.144
Ooh, mm-mm.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.103
Fine, fine, but do not
call me Peanut. I'm 15.

03:55.191 --> 03:57.759
I don't care
if you're 15 or however old.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.545
You're still gonna always be
my little, little Peanut.

04:04.156 --> 04:08.509
When do you go back to school?
Soon? I hope so.

04:09.945 --> 04:11.686
All right,
let me snap a picture.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.384
I'm gonna post it tonight
for, uh, #styleitSaturdays.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.212
Okay.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.432
Um...

04:18.519 --> 04:20.608
-Here, let's just take a selfie.
-Okay.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.961
Lauren, smile.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.224
- Aren't you happy?
- Yes.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.707
Breakfast!

04:32.794 --> 04:34.274
Okay. Wait, do you smell that?

04:34.404 --> 04:35.884
I do.
I'll race you to it.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.015
Okay.

04:37.102 --> 04:39.148
I'm right behind you.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.980
Girls! Hello? Breakfast!

04:45.110 --> 04:47.374
I'm coming.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.466
Hey, hey, hey!
No running in my kitchen.

04:52.596 --> 04:55.207
I did not raise
a pack of animals.

04:55.295 --> 05:00.778
Oh! These braids are beautiful.
You did this, Lauren?

05:00.865 --> 05:02.954
-It's no biggie.
-Oh, it's no biggie.

05:03.085 --> 05:07.307
Well, I...appreciate it.

05:07.437 --> 05:09.004
Okay, Mom.

05:09.134 --> 05:12.050
Oh, my girls
are growing up too fast.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.487
You know, not long ago,

05:13.617 --> 05:16.707
I couldn't pay you to sit still
long enough for braids.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.970
I don't know how I raised
these tender-headed children.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.407
Huh.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.104
Pot...meet kettle.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.975
Shut it, Peanut.

05:27.239 --> 05:29.154
Look at all of us together.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.896
I love it.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.682
It's nice to have you home
for the weekend, Lauren.

05:34.812 --> 05:38.381
Yeah. I'm happy I'm here, too.

05:38.468 --> 05:41.341
Although I did think that
since you're just 20 minutes

05:41.428 --> 05:45.214
up the road, that we get
to see you a little more often.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.739
Sorry.
I just have a lot going on.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.611
Like what? I want to know.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.091
I want to know everything
that's going on at school.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.224
Why don't you tell me
about your new job first?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.922
How is it being VP?

05:58.053 --> 06:02.884
It's good.
I mean, it's a lot, but...good.

06:03.014 --> 06:06.191
Was it worth
moving across the country?

06:06.322 --> 06:08.280
I think we all needed
a fresh start

06:08.411 --> 06:11.545
after Dad passed away.

06:13.503 --> 06:17.377
Yeah. You know, I thought the VP
was supposed to be a step up.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.944
They have you doing your job
and, like, five others.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.686
I know. I am just
trying to do what I got to do.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.297
Enough about me.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.691
Lauren,
I want to know everything

06:27.822 --> 06:29.867
that's going on in college.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.174
Can we talk about it later?

06:32.304 --> 06:34.742
Why can't we talk about it now?

06:34.872 --> 06:37.571
I just don't want
to talk about it now.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.659
Uh, you know, these potatoes
look really nice, Mom.

06:39.747 --> 06:42.880
The bacon looks good.
You even have eggs.

06:42.967 --> 06:45.709
Why are you avoiding
talking about school?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.755
Is there a problem?

06:47.885 --> 06:50.235
I'm just...

06:50.322 --> 06:52.586
I'm really unhappy there.

06:54.501 --> 06:58.940
That's news to me.
Are your grades dropping?

06:59.027 --> 07:02.509
-I knew you would act like that.
-Okay, guys, we cannot--

07:02.639 --> 07:03.553
Act like what?
I'm just trying to understand.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.642
Are you saying
that you want to switch schools?

07:05.773 --> 07:09.429
No. Mom, I'm saying
that I want to drop out.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.694
Uh-oh.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.565
Marley, go to your room.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.220
-Mom.
-Go to your room.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.136
Well...

07:24.356 --> 07:25.357
Absolutely not.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.272
You're not even listening to me.

07:27.359 --> 07:28.796
Oh, I hear you.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.407
You want to throw your life
away and drop out of school?

07:31.538 --> 07:33.148
Okay, that's not fair, Mom.

07:33.235 --> 07:37.195
You know what's not fair?
The time, the money.

07:37.326 --> 07:40.155
I mean, all the effort to
prepare you for the Ivy League.

07:40.284 --> 07:42.766
And no one asked you
to do any of that.

07:42.897 --> 07:47.205
Mom, I'm trying to tell you.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.903
I think I'm depressed.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.863
You don't look depressed to me.

07:52.950 --> 07:56.171
Well, maybe you're seeing
whatever youwanna see.

07:56.301 --> 08:00.915
I can't focus in school.
I'm always tired.

08:01.002 --> 08:06.442
I just...feel empty.

08:06.573 --> 08:10.402
Okay, Lauren, baby, I know
this is a tough transition,

08:10.533 --> 08:12.274
but when I was your age,

08:12.404 --> 08:13.884
I was too busy supporting myself
through college

08:13.971 --> 08:15.582
to feel depressed.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.714
Okay, so because
you had a rough childhood,

08:17.801 --> 08:19.063
I'm not supposed
to feel anything?

08:19.150 --> 08:23.198
Oh, my God. Your generation
is obsessed with feelings.

08:23.328 --> 08:27.724
If you're overwhelmed,
just come home.

08:27.855 --> 08:30.466
If I was to stay here,
I'd go crazy.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.861
So what do you think,
I'm running a torture chamber?

08:34.991 --> 08:37.952
Do you know
how good you have it?

08:38.082 --> 08:40.476
You have a beautiful home
with a family that loves you.

08:40.563 --> 08:42.826
Mom, I can't keep up
with this fake orange juice

08:42.913 --> 08:45.220
Life commercial thing
that you're trying to live.

08:45.307 --> 08:47.048
It's bullshit.

08:50.355 --> 08:52.749
I am so glad your father
isn't here to see this.

08:54.142 --> 08:56.536
He would be so disappointed.

08:58.450 --> 09:02.150
Lauren, I didn't mean that.

09:02.237 --> 09:04.152
I-I didn't mean that, babe.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.552
You're leaving early?

09:14.858 --> 09:16.904
I can't be around here
right now.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.910
M-Maybe we can talk about it.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.266
I'll see you later, Peanut,
okay?

10:04.299 --> 10:06.388
You've reached Lauren.
I'm not here.

10:06.518 --> 10:07.781
Leave a message.

10:07.868 --> 10:12.133
Lauren, it's Mom.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.789
This radio silence has gone
too long. Call me back.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.313
Please?

10:20.576 --> 10:23.884
Blue Valley, Texas,
is home for today's best music.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.756
94.7. In national news,

10:26.843 --> 10:29.324
missing 18-year-old Oregon girl
Jessica Russo

10:29.411 --> 10:31.631
has not been seen
for several days.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.328
Reports say
she was last seen--

10:33.458 --> 10:35.504
Hey, I was listening to that.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.679
I have to focus.

10:36.810 --> 10:40.465
I'm stressed
about this chem exam today.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.512
No reason to be stressed if you
had studied hard enough, right?

10:43.599 --> 10:46.036
And I've seen
you working your butt off.

10:46.123 --> 10:49.083
Yeah, but now that I hit
the social outcast jackpot,

10:49.213 --> 10:50.388
being both the new kid

10:50.475 --> 10:51.346
and the vice principal's
daughter,

10:51.433 --> 10:54.958
Mom, academic excellence
is all I have.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.917
You got an "A"-minus
on the last exam.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.267
"A"-plus is excellent.

11:02.923 --> 11:05.273
Good morning, Blue Valley High.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.492
It's Principal Shepherd here,
your biggest cheerleader.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.451
It's another beautiful day,

11:09.538 --> 11:12.933
another chance
to academically excel.

11:13.063 --> 11:14.804
And I want to
say good luck to all of you

11:14.891 --> 11:17.589
taking the state placement exam
this morning.

11:17.720 --> 11:21.463
We believe in you. We know
you can do it. Go, Tigers!

11:43.398 --> 11:44.878
Stop.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.707
Bitch.

11:58.674 --> 12:01.242
Hey. Slow down!
Stop running.

12:03.113 --> 12:05.072
Mr. Guilford.

12:05.202 --> 12:06.726
No hoodies.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.035
Enough, you two.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.734
Hands and tongues to ourselves.

12:18.694 --> 12:21.262
Hey, yo, hit me.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.265
Hey!

12:24.395 --> 12:27.094
-Whoops.
-What did I do to you, Josh?

12:27.224 --> 12:30.575
I'm not gonna let you cheat off
of me because you didn't study.

12:30.706 --> 12:34.188
I don't like people like you.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.798
What does that mean?

12:35.885 --> 12:37.800
You think you're better
than everyone

12:37.931 --> 12:39.671
just 'cause you're
the vice principal's daughter?

12:39.802 --> 12:42.631
No, I don't. I literally just...

12:42.762 --> 12:43.980
Oh, my God.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.765
Mr. Whelan.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.507
What do you think you're doing?

12:49.594 --> 12:51.292
It was an accident.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.903
Are you planning to apologize?

12:53.990 --> 12:55.426
Sorry, Marley. Can I go?

12:55.557 --> 12:59.039
Yes,
to the principal's office. Now.

13:03.913 --> 13:06.916
What is this that Josh
is trying to cheat off of you?

13:07.047 --> 13:10.354
Don't freak out, Mom. I got it.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.879
My daughter hides the fact that
she's being bullied in school?

13:12.966 --> 13:15.272
I think I can freak out
a little.

13:15.359 --> 13:19.059
I'm just doing what
you taught us--grin and bear it.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.204
Ahem.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.467
Hey, Cheryl.

13:36.554 --> 13:37.642
Hi.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.122
I have the, uh, minutes

13:39.253 --> 13:40.732
from the PTA meeting
from last week.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.604
Ah, great. Thank you.

13:42.734 --> 13:44.693
We have three teachers
on maternity leave,

13:44.780 --> 13:46.260
so I took the liberty
of rearranging

13:46.390 --> 13:48.349
the detention monitor schedules.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.612
Great. Great. Thanks.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.788
No idea what we'd do without you
if you hadn't showed up here.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.096
Um, Principal Shepherd,

13:56.183 --> 13:58.489
have you had a chance
to speak with, uh, Josh Whelan?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.230
Uh, yeah, it looks like

14:00.361 --> 14:03.755
it was just some sort of
miscommunication, I guess.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.889
I saw him knock the books
out of my daughter's hand

14:06.976 --> 14:08.630
because she wouldn't
let him cheat off of her.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.328
Well, you know, he assured me
that it was an accident.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.243
This is actually
the first thing I'm hearing

14:13.330 --> 14:15.811
about anything
about cheating, Cheryl.

14:15.942 --> 14:19.554
Respectfully, sir,
he's lying to you,

14:19.641 --> 14:21.512
and you and I both know
that his behavior

14:21.643 --> 14:23.079
is against the code of conduct.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.125
Where the hell are the forms for
the district? I can't find 'em.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.170
Bottom right drawer.

14:27.257 --> 14:30.086
Oh. Okay. Here we go.

14:30.217 --> 14:31.827
Perfect. Thank you.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.176
Look, Cheryl,

14:33.307 --> 14:36.179
I have known this young man
and his family for years.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.441
These are good people.

14:37.572 --> 14:38.834
I don't doubt that, but I--

14:38.965 --> 14:40.705
And I don't need to tell you

14:40.836 --> 14:43.056
that the school is basically
running on fumes, you know?

14:43.186 --> 14:45.101
The school district is
looking down our throats,

14:45.232 --> 14:47.190
and I-I don't think
we need to provoke them now

14:47.321 --> 14:50.411
with accusations about cheating
and bullying and...

14:50.498 --> 14:52.239
Hang on one sec.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.458
Hello? Hey, uh,
Superintendent Richards.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.372
Thank you so much for calling.
Yeah. No, I have the forms.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.679
I'm just--Hold--
Can you hold up one sec?

14:57.766 --> 14:59.507
Could you--
Cheryl, do you mind?

14:59.637 --> 15:03.424
I just need a second.
Thank you. Yeah. So, I'm sorry.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.382
Yeah, I'm--
I'm working on it right now.

15:05.513 --> 15:06.993
...The boyfriend

15:07.123 --> 15:09.647
of missing Oregon teenager
Jessica Russo

15:09.778 --> 15:13.782
has become the target of
substantial online harassment.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.176
That behavior is
leading a lot of people

15:16.263 --> 15:17.003
on social media to...

15:17.133 --> 15:20.006
I heard about this on the radio.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.051
Turn up the volume.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.053
Family and friends of Jessica

15:24.184 --> 15:26.838
and also volunteers
all around the country

15:26.926 --> 15:30.016
pursue leads and also try
to spread awareness.

15:30.146 --> 15:33.454
Rogers, the last person
to have seen her alive,

15:33.540 --> 15:36.022
is refusing to do interviews.

15:36.152 --> 15:41.505
We believe someone
took our angel, Jessica.

15:41.592 --> 15:46.815
I-I just keep replaying what
she said to me before she left.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.644
"I love you, Mom."

15:49.774 --> 15:51.298
Oh, God.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.996
That poor family.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.217
Can you imagine
if that was your child?

15:57.347 --> 15:59.871
Absolutely not.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.482
...around the clock
with this search.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.267
Hey, are you okay over there?

16:04.354 --> 16:06.487
Um...yeah, it's nothing.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.490
I had a little argument
with my eldest.

16:09.577 --> 16:10.970
Didn't end well?

16:11.057 --> 16:13.320
She hasn't returned my call
in two days or texts,

16:13.407 --> 16:17.802
which isn't like her,
even when she's pissed at Mom.

16:17.889 --> 16:21.589
Listen, when our son
went to college,

16:21.719 --> 16:25.332
well, we didn't hear from him
for months at a clip...

16:25.419 --> 16:28.770
unless he needed, um, pizza
or beer money, of course.

16:28.900 --> 16:31.903
Of course.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.950
So, you know,
it's natural to worry, Cheryl.

16:35.037 --> 16:40.129
Just...don't make yourself sick
about it.

16:40.216 --> 16:44.394
You're right.
Thank you, Susan.

16:44.481 --> 16:47.528
We have been searching
since about 6:00.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.920
It's your girl, Lauren,

16:49.051 --> 16:52.315
and today I am naming
my top five favorite hairstyles.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.623
To start off, you know,
we have to do the pigtails,

16:55.753 --> 16:57.364
which is what I'm wearing
right now with my curly hair.

16:57.451 --> 16:58.974
Second up, we--

17:03.718 --> 17:07.374
I guess I didn't make it
to #Saturdaystyles.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.518
Hey. Why are you on your phone

17:21.605 --> 17:23.215
when you're supposed
to be doing your chores?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.220
This is why Lauren left.

17:27.349 --> 17:28.917
Excuse me?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.528
I said,
maybe if you weren't so aggro,

17:31.615 --> 17:33.704
Lauren wouldn't have left early.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.838
I didn't force Lauren to leave.

17:36.968 --> 17:38.666
No, but you chased her away,

17:38.753 --> 17:40.363
and now she won't
even talk to me.

17:40.450 --> 17:43.758
You haven't heard from her
since she left?

17:43.888 --> 17:46.021
Negative.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.154
Has she posted anything online?

17:48.241 --> 17:49.590
No.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.071
She even missed
#MondayMotivation.

17:54.682 --> 17:56.945
I think she's really upset.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.777
I'll be right back.
I got to make a phone call.

18:04.735 --> 18:08.348
I didn't realize you hadn't
spoken to her in months.

18:08.435 --> 18:09.740
Okay.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.787
Best of luck with school,
Destiny.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.009
Hi. It's Cheryl.

18:18.097 --> 18:22.231
Have you spoken to Lauren?
No, everything is good.

18:22.362 --> 18:25.626
Hi. It's Cheryl. Oh, you haven't
spoken to her in a few days.

18:25.756 --> 18:27.715
Yeah, we're--we're loving
the new town.

18:27.802 --> 18:30.065
Oh, you haven't spoken to her
in a day or two.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.980
Just having
a hard time reaching her.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.657
Yeah?

18:56.787 --> 18:58.006
Who's this?

18:58.093 --> 18:59.486
Who's this?

18:59.573 --> 19:01.618
You called me.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.925
I'm Cheryl Baker.

19:04.055 --> 19:07.711
I-I found your number in
my daughter Lauren's call log.

19:07.798 --> 19:11.889
This is Eddie Brick. I manage
the coffee shop at Canning.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.675
Where she works.

19:14.805 --> 19:15.676
Worked.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.678
What do you mean?

19:17.808 --> 19:19.854
She hasn't shown up
in a few days.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.770
In fact, if you talk to her,

19:22.900 --> 19:26.208
let her know she doesn't
need to bother coming back.

19:26.339 --> 19:29.603
She's fired.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.895
Wait, why are we at Canning?

20:00.982 --> 20:03.463
I want to go check in on Lauren.
Stay in the car, okay?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.204
Okay.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.093
Lauren, it's Mom!

20:29.706 --> 20:31.273
Lauren?

20:33.449 --> 20:35.843
Can I help you?

20:35.930 --> 20:40.978
Hi. I'm Lauren's mom. I think
we met briefly at move-in day.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.153
Oh, right.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.156
Um, I haven't been able
to reach her.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.028
Have you heard from her today?

20:47.158 --> 20:51.772
Uh...no, she hasn't been here
since I got back yesterday.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.817
I figured she was
still visiting home.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.128
Is everything okay?

21:04.306 --> 21:07.091
I think my daughter's missing.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.927
Oh, we've been here all night.

21:17.058 --> 21:19.060
What are they looking for?

21:19.190 --> 21:21.932
Any clue that will
tell us where Lauren went.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.463
Did you find anything?

21:30.550 --> 21:31.899
Well, there's no signs
of forced entry.

21:31.986 --> 21:34.902
There's a bag missing
with some clothes,

21:34.989 --> 21:37.252
her computer, and her phone.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.776
Otherwise, it seems as if
your daughter left voluntarily.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.213
That doesn't make sense.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.433
I mean, she would have
called us and let us know,

21:44.564 --> 21:47.175
and all of a sudden
her phone is off?

21:47.262 --> 21:50.352
Look, I've seen this before.
Students get overwhelmed.

21:50.439 --> 21:53.224
They skip out for a couple days,
and then they come back.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.574
Not my daughter.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.445
I mean, maybe other students,
but not my daughter.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.926
She wouldn't run away.
She wouldn't.

21:59.056 --> 22:00.710
Yeah, well, I spoke
with her roommate, Annie,

22:00.841 --> 22:02.146
who said
that your daughter has been

22:02.233 --> 22:06.020
exhibiting strange behavior
lately, been skipping school.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.327
Did you know that
about your daughter?

22:10.503 --> 22:11.939
No.

22:12.026 --> 22:14.289
-No.
-I wasn't aware.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.117
Look, I know this isn't easy
to hear,

22:16.204 --> 22:18.989
but there is no need to panic.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.339
Chances are
your daughter's going to show up

22:20.426 --> 22:21.949
in a couple days
in your doorstep

22:22.036 --> 22:23.472
with a bag of dirty laundry.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.431
So then what?

22:25.518 --> 22:27.433
Do we just wait to see if
my sister's actually missing?

22:27.520 --> 22:29.043
I thought the first 48 hours

22:29.173 --> 22:31.306
are supposed to be
the most important.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.701
Marley. I'm sorry.
It's been a long night.

22:34.788 --> 22:37.268
Look, we put a BOLO
out on your sister, okay?

22:37.356 --> 22:39.662
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.186
Thanks.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.240
Hello?

23:39.374 --> 23:41.637
Okay. Well, you said previously
that Lauren

23:41.768 --> 23:43.683
was home for the weekend,
but she left early.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.162
Why is that?

23:45.249 --> 23:48.688
We...had an argument,

23:48.818 --> 23:51.038
but she said she was heading
right back to school.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.823
Were you able to find out
if that's true?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.477
An argument.

23:55.564 --> 23:59.263
Um, yes. There is surveillance
footage of her leaving campus.

23:59.394 --> 24:03.746
Um, problem is, it goes cold
once she gets right off campus.

24:03.833 --> 24:07.184
Now, Lauren took both
her phone and her computer.

24:07.271 --> 24:11.537
Do you guys have passwords
or access to her social media?

24:11.624 --> 24:13.669
No.

24:13.756 --> 24:16.629
But you can subpoena
the social media companies

24:16.716 --> 24:17.934
to get her data, right?

24:18.021 --> 24:19.414
We can.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.938
It takes about two to four weeks
to ever hear back,

24:22.025 --> 24:23.723
and if there isn't
sufficient cause,

24:23.810 --> 24:25.115
then we won't get it.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.421
And in this case,
there really isn't.

24:26.552 --> 24:31.731
Um...trying to do some
background on your daughter.

24:31.861 --> 24:35.865
Does she have any history
of prior disappearances...

24:35.996 --> 24:37.345
-No.
-...or drugs

24:37.476 --> 24:38.781
or any close cases?

24:38.912 --> 24:40.827
No! And--and--No.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.916
Detective,
are you trying to figure out

24:43.003 --> 24:46.833
if my daughter is a criminal
or if a crime occurred here?

24:46.920 --> 24:48.835
I'm--I'm just trying to get
my facts straight, ma'am.

24:48.922 --> 24:49.836
That's it.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.535
Okay, well,
Ms. Baker, the truth is,

24:53.666 --> 24:55.276
we've got
no evidence of foul play,

24:55.406 --> 24:57.408
and Lauren is an adult.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.108
Detective, she's 18.

25:01.238 --> 25:04.111
And, um, she voluntarily
left her college campus.

25:04.241 --> 25:05.678
There's no crime there.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.466
What about, uh, a search party

25:11.553 --> 25:14.164
to check the woods
behind the college, or--

25:14.251 --> 25:18.342
That's a great idea. That's
been very effective in the past.

25:18.473 --> 25:20.867
Unfortunately, we don't
have the resources for that.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.869
But if you could get
some volunteers together,

25:22.999 --> 25:28.004
put up some flyers, get involved
in social media, be a huge help.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.921
Volunteers have spread out.

25:32.008 --> 25:33.096
- Jessica.
- Jessica Russo.

25:33.227 --> 25:35.664
As volunteers
from across the nation gather,

25:35.751 --> 25:38.362
the FBI now believes
that Jessica Russo

25:38.493 --> 25:42.453
may have been abducted
by a potential serial killer

25:42.541 --> 25:44.368
who is showing
a similar pattern of killings

25:44.455 --> 25:47.197
to the infamous serial killer
Ted Bundy,

25:47.284 --> 25:49.852
and that suspect is
believed to be responsible

25:49.939 --> 25:54.422
for three murders
across the Pacific Northwest.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.969
Lauren!

26:20.100 --> 26:21.580
Lauren?!

26:25.496 --> 26:27.586
Lauren!

26:30.501 --> 26:32.416
Lauren!

26:33.983 --> 26:35.898
Lauren!

26:42.383 --> 26:44.298
It's Detective Dean.

26:44.385 --> 26:46.605
I'm unavailable right now.
Please leave a--

27:08.539 --> 27:11.673
I've been following this
Jessica Russo disappearance,

27:11.804 --> 27:13.806
but you just never think
it's actually going to be

27:13.936 --> 27:15.895
ever in your own backyard.

27:16.025 --> 27:20.856
I mean, I don't know.
They seem like nice family.

27:20.987 --> 27:25.687
Cheryl, we were
just saying how sorry we are

27:25.818 --> 27:28.211
that you have
to go through all of this.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.779
I made an announcement
at church,

27:30.866 --> 27:34.783
and everyone's praying
for Lauren.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.698
Word's going to get out there.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.265
Excuse me.

27:38.352 --> 27:42.573
And when it does, I bet
that her face will be plastered

27:42.661 --> 27:45.446
all over the TV screen
just like Jessica Russo's.

28:10.950 --> 28:14.301
Cheryl?

28:14.388 --> 28:16.172
Are you okay?

28:27.009 --> 28:28.184
Next up,
I don't need to tell you.

28:28.315 --> 28:32.711
This Jessica Russo case
has been a ratings knockout.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.061
So as a result, no shocker.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.411
National wants every station
covering, running--

28:37.498 --> 28:38.804
Sorry. Sorry, Russ.

28:38.891 --> 28:43.678
Oh, excuse me.
Jessica, Jessica, Jessica 24/7.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.680
Too much is not enough.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.900
Elisa,
how kind of you to join us.

28:47.987 --> 28:49.815
Sorry.
A school drop-off is literally

28:49.945 --> 28:51.294
my ninth circle of hell.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.907
And it looks like you got
a little gift there as a bonus.

28:54.994 --> 28:57.170
Awesome.

28:57.257 --> 28:59.607
Next up,
the station has received

28:59.694 --> 29:01.870
approximately 35 calls

29:01.957 --> 29:04.307
from a local mom
whose daughter is MIA.

29:04.394 --> 29:06.005
How old is the kid?

29:06.092 --> 29:08.834
She's not a kid.
She's a student at Canning.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.836
Now, I've looked into this.
There's no story here.

29:10.923 --> 29:12.011
Plus, we've already
got our hands filled

29:12.141 --> 29:13.708
with one missing girl already.

29:13.795 --> 29:16.363
However,
some lucky winner here today

29:16.493 --> 29:20.584
is going to be the one to call
and let the mom down gently.

29:20.671 --> 29:24.588
Wow. So busy with your pad.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.677
Oh, these two,
solving world problems.

29:26.765 --> 29:31.334
Nothing from them...
leaving Miss Punctual herself.

29:31.421 --> 29:34.555
Elisa,
will you do me the honor?

29:34.642 --> 29:36.470
-Sure.
-Thank you very much.

29:36.557 --> 29:38.341
All right, everybody,
get back to work. Come on.

29:38.428 --> 29:42.345
News waits for no one.

29:42.432 --> 29:45.871
So your daughter's been missing
just over a week?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.786
Yeah, and it's been a nightmare.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.700
I can't even get in touch
with the detective

29:49.788 --> 29:51.746
that's assigned to her case.

29:51.877 --> 29:53.226
I mean, the cops
called my sister a runaway,

29:53.313 --> 29:55.837
like that makes her
not worth their time.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.143
What can you tell me
about Lauren?

29:57.230 --> 30:00.146
Did she have any personal
problems leading up to this?

30:00.233 --> 30:03.062
My husband died last year.

30:03.149 --> 30:05.586
Coronary heart disease.

30:07.544 --> 30:10.069
His death has been tough
on the girls.

30:10.156 --> 30:13.333
Lauren has struggled in school.
She's acted out a bit,

30:13.420 --> 30:17.903
but she has never
and would neverrun away.

30:17.990 --> 30:21.689
I have to ask, considering what
your family has been through,

30:21.820 --> 30:24.692
Did Lauren show any signs
of suicidal ideation?

30:24.779 --> 30:29.349
No. It could never
have gotten that bad. I...

30:29.436 --> 30:31.177
I would have seen something.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.353
Would you?

30:37.096 --> 30:38.706
You don't...

30:38.793 --> 30:40.969
You don't take a computer
if you're going to.

30:44.451 --> 30:48.977
My gut tells me
that my daughter is out there.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.197
I believe you.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.982
And we would be happy
to run Lauren's photo

30:54.069 --> 30:56.115
in the 5:00 local news roundup.

30:56.245 --> 30:58.508
That's it?
I thought you were taking notes

30:58.595 --> 31:00.423
to maybe do a story
or something.

31:00.510 --> 31:02.730
No, it's to see if there is
a story.

31:02.817 --> 31:05.124
But look, if I'm being honest
with you, there--

31:05.211 --> 31:07.039
there's just not much here.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.171
The police--they found no signs
of forcible abduction.

31:09.258 --> 31:13.436
So until my daughter is
murdered, she's not newsworthy.

31:13.567 --> 31:17.701
Unless salient details emerge,
there is no story

31:17.832 --> 31:19.660
for me to report.

31:19.790 --> 31:22.402
Elisa, phone call.

31:22.489 --> 31:25.144
I am really sorry.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.151
Why does nobody care?

31:32.281 --> 31:34.153
We're going to find her.

31:44.119 --> 31:46.034
"Netsleuths.com.

31:46.121 --> 31:50.865
Netsleuths.
Amateur crime solvers"?

31:58.090 --> 32:02.050
"Please...help me

32:02.137 --> 32:05.358
find...my sister."

32:21.722 --> 32:23.811
Have you seen my daughter?

32:26.727 --> 32:28.555
Hey, guys.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.339
H-Have you seen...

32:30.426 --> 32:32.254
Have you seen my daughter?
Do you know Lauren?

32:32.385 --> 32:34.604
If you see her...

32:48.009 --> 32:50.272
Come on, Tina.

32:50.359 --> 32:52.274
Don't you want to
see a movie with me?

32:52.361 --> 32:54.624
Huh? Just one little
itty-bitty date?

32:54.755 --> 32:57.758
Just one casual date, huh?

32:59.412 --> 33:03.938
Welcome to Canning Café.
Hey, what can we get for you?

33:04.069 --> 33:07.942
I'm looking for information
about my daughter, Lauren Baker.

33:09.422 --> 33:11.337
Right. We--We spoke before.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.817
Look, I already told the cops
everything I know.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.080
Which is?

33:15.210 --> 33:17.038
Your daughter was
always showing up to work late,

33:17.125 --> 33:19.475
making up excuses.

33:19.562 --> 33:22.522
Then last week, she stopped
showing up altogether.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.132
Really screwed me
during rush hour.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.355
That eye looks pretty painful.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.705
Did you get in an accident?

33:31.792 --> 33:35.883
It's nothing. It fell.

33:38.538 --> 33:40.061
Hey there.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.498
Welcome to Canning Café.
Uh, look,

33:42.585 --> 33:45.980
I got to get back to work.
Hope Lauren turns up, okay?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.863
Um...

33:59.994 --> 34:01.604
Excuse me.

34:01.691 --> 34:05.173
Did you know Lauren?

34:05.260 --> 34:08.176
We were only work friends
or maybe...

34:08.306 --> 34:10.222
allies in the trenches.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.920
Hey, Tina, I need
a double caramel macchiato,

34:13.007 --> 34:15.226
like, today, please.

34:15.357 --> 34:17.141
He's off in 30 minutes

34:17.228 --> 34:18.839
if you want to meet outside.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.536
Yes.

34:20.623 --> 34:22.060
Thank you.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.898
-Mrs. Baker?
-Cheryl. Thanks for meeting me.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.292
Is it true no one's heard
from Lauren in over a week?

34:37.422 --> 34:40.904
Unfortunately, yes.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.601
You said you and Lauren
were allies in the trenches.

34:42.688 --> 34:44.603
What did you mean?

34:44.690 --> 34:48.172
Uh...it means Eddie, our boss,
is a real jerk,

34:48.303 --> 34:51.132
especially if you have boobs.

34:51.219 --> 34:53.569
He harasses the girls?

34:53.656 --> 34:56.005
I guess technically,
it's harassment.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.834
I think of him more like

34:57.965 --> 35:00.185
a little fly buzzing
in your ear.

35:00.272 --> 35:03.101
It's annoying, but harmless.

35:04.754 --> 35:08.584
You think Eddie has something to
do with Lauren's disappearance?

35:08.671 --> 35:11.109
Maybe.
But turns out there's a lot

35:11.196 --> 35:14.677
about my daughter
that I didn't know.

35:14.764 --> 35:19.639
Truthfully, Eddie's a sleaze,
but he's all bark.

35:19.726 --> 35:23.121
I can't imagine
he would actually hurt someone.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.036
Thanks.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.430
There is one person you might
want to look into, though.

35:28.517 --> 35:31.912
Uh, a stuck-up roommate.
What's her name?

35:32.042 --> 35:34.044
-Annie?
-That's it.

35:34.132 --> 35:39.702
If I had to put money on
who might actually harm Lauren,

35:39.833 --> 35:42.879
It'd be Annie.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.577
Thanks.

35:54.891 --> 35:57.285
- Hi.
- I've left you a dozen messages.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.721
Yeah, I've been
meaning to call you.

35:58.808 --> 36:01.637
It's been
such a crazy news week.

36:01.768 --> 36:04.292
My daughter's news.
She's local news.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.903
Meanwhile, you have
round-the-clock coverage

36:06.990 --> 36:08.905
of some girl lost in Oregon.

36:08.992 --> 36:12.474
National wants all affiliates
focused on Jessica Russo.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.563
Well,
while no one's making progress

36:14.650 --> 36:18.915
on my daughter's case,
I found two potential suspects.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.396
Did you bring this
to the police?

36:21.483 --> 36:25.052
Yeah, I tried, but they never
returned my calls.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.358
Eddie Brick.

36:26.445 --> 36:28.273
Lauren's coworker said
that he has a history

36:28.360 --> 36:30.971
of sexually harassing the girls
that work there,

36:31.101 --> 36:32.712
and when I spoke to him--

36:32.842 --> 36:35.280
Whoa, you spoke
to a possible suspect?

36:35.367 --> 36:36.890
That could be dangerous.

36:36.977 --> 36:38.674
My daughter is missing.
What should I do?

36:38.805 --> 36:40.807
Sit back and--and knit?

36:43.853 --> 36:49.511
Lauren's roommate, Annie Dolan.
According to the coworker,

36:49.598 --> 36:52.427
there's been
some bullying going on.

36:52.558 --> 36:55.169
Okay. Uh...

36:55.300 --> 36:57.345
Can you be more specific?

36:57.476 --> 37:00.696
Like, what kind of bullying
are we talking about?

37:00.827 --> 37:02.002
She didn't give me any details,

37:02.132 --> 37:05.048
but apparently the situation
has gotten really bad.

37:05.135 --> 37:07.137
Mrs. Baker,
I know that you think

37:07.225 --> 37:11.011
that I've been ignoring you,
but I-I did speak to the police.

37:12.752 --> 37:13.753
You did?

37:13.883 --> 37:15.798
Yes.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.714
And the statements that
Mr. Brick and Miss Dolan gave

37:18.801 --> 37:22.065
did not provoke any suspicion.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.458
Do you have proof
that your daughter

37:23.589 --> 37:26.113
was being sexually harassed
and bullied?

37:26.200 --> 37:27.462
No, but that shouldn't--

37:27.593 --> 37:31.510
I-I-I do want to help you.
I swear I do.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.600
But I cannot call people
suspects on live TV

37:34.687 --> 37:36.863
based on hearsay.

37:36.950 --> 37:39.257
Does that make sense?

37:42.651 --> 37:44.392
Are you a mom?

37:45.741 --> 37:47.047
Yeah. Um...

37:48.570 --> 37:52.574
This is....my son Gabriel.

37:52.661 --> 37:53.749
He's 6?

37:53.836 --> 37:56.361
Yeah, he just turned.
Good guess.

38:00.713 --> 38:05.108
For 20 years, I've watched
school drop-off and pick-up,

38:05.195 --> 38:08.895
from preschoolers
to high schoolers.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.767
You know the one thing
that never changes?

38:11.854 --> 38:13.856
The way a parent
looks at their child

38:13.943 --> 38:15.902
when they say goodbye.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.734
I haven't been able to eat.

38:21.864 --> 38:25.390
I haven't been able to sleep.

38:25.520 --> 38:31.309
All I wonder is if I said
my last goodbye to my daughter.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.661
Cheryl, wait. Wait, um...

38:37.663 --> 38:41.841
As a journalist, there are
legal limits to what I can do.

38:41.928 --> 38:46.498
But speaking as...as a mom,

38:46.585 --> 38:49.239
I would...

38:49.327 --> 38:51.285
I would check out
her room again.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.200
You would be shocked
to see what good evidence

38:53.287 --> 38:54.984
just gets overlooked.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.863
Girl, I'm coming.

39:47.950 --> 39:51.084
I just forgot something.

39:51.171 --> 39:54.827
What are you doing in here?
Is that my phone?

39:54.957 --> 39:56.872
What DMs don't you want
the police to know, Annie?

39:57.003 --> 40:00.267
I don't know what you're
talking about. Give me my phone!

40:02.965 --> 40:07.492
Whatever you did to my daughter,
I'm gonna find out.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.071
Annie is
clearly hiding something.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.334
We have to find those DMs

40:24.422 --> 40:25.858
that she doesn't want the cops
to see.

40:25.945 --> 40:29.252
I might have an idea.

40:29.339 --> 40:32.865
But...I don't think
you're going to like it.

40:35.084 --> 40:37.391
They're like amateur detectives
who gather online

40:37.478 --> 40:39.611
to solve crimes.

40:39.698 --> 40:40.960
Marley,
I don't think it's a good idea

40:41.047 --> 40:42.831
for you to be talking
to strangers.

40:42.918 --> 40:44.572
But this may be
our only chance of finding out

40:44.659 --> 40:46.618
what happened to Lauren.

40:46.748 --> 40:49.795
Look, they said this one girl,
um, Bella Holmes, 2008,

40:49.882 --> 40:52.014
is a tech whiz.

40:52.101 --> 40:55.975
Mom, she may be able
to help us find those DMs.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.285
Let's ask them.

41:02.372 --> 41:04.331
Um, okay.

41:10.337 --> 41:12.078
I have to admit,

41:12.165 --> 41:15.951
I wasn't expecting
a 16-year-old tech quiz.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.518
I know what you're thinking,

41:17.649 --> 41:20.347
but I've helped solve seven
different cases on Netsleuths.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.349
You mentioned
that you might be able to hack

41:22.436 --> 41:24.699
into Lauren's
social media accounts?

41:24.786 --> 41:27.006
Hopefully, but you say you don't
have any physical access

41:27.136 --> 41:28.790
to her devices, right?

41:28.921 --> 41:30.096
-No.
-Mm-mm.

41:30.226 --> 41:33.273
Lauren took them with her,
and her phone's shut off.

41:33.360 --> 41:36.058
I can't remotely access a device
that's been turned off,

41:36.145 --> 41:40.410
so we guess. Most passwords
follow a simple format--

41:40.498 --> 41:42.543
a word or phrase,
first letter capitalized,

41:42.630 --> 41:44.806
a 2- or 3-digit number
at the end.

41:44.893 --> 41:48.506
First, you should make a list of
all of Lauren's favorite things.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.464
Hey, guys,
it's your girl, Lauren,

41:50.551 --> 41:53.249
And today, I'm naming
my top five favorite hairstyles.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.643
Her favorite movies.

41:55.730 --> 41:57.079
Her favorite number was eight.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.517
Then you should check
if there are any likely pairs

41:59.604 --> 42:00.735
between the phrases
and numbers.

42:00.866 --> 42:04.565
This is where it sort of
becomes a gut instinct.

42:04.696 --> 42:07.263
What does Lauren
really care about?

42:07.350 --> 42:09.178
I mean, there could be

42:09.265 --> 42:11.224
a thousand different
combinations for that.

42:11.311 --> 42:12.486
Yeah, I mean,
her favorite color is yellow.

42:12.617 --> 42:15.968
I mean, it could take weeks
to write everything down.

42:16.098 --> 42:17.752
It could be thousands of 'em.

42:17.883 --> 42:19.275
Except we only get
three guesses.

42:19.362 --> 42:21.495
Three?

42:21.582 --> 42:23.715
Marley's right.
Most social media sites

42:23.802 --> 42:26.848
lock you out for 24 hours
after three wrong guesses,

42:26.979 --> 42:29.155
and you could get permanently
locked out after that.

42:29.285 --> 42:31.244
-Okay.
-Okay.

42:41.297 --> 42:44.344
Damn. Try the next one.

42:44.431 --> 42:46.564
Should we do her favorite color?

42:46.651 --> 42:48.130
-O-Okay.
-Okay.

42:48.217 --> 42:49.654
I'll try it.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.048
Damn.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.964
-Hey.
-You said it first.

42:56.095 --> 42:58.358
One last left.

42:58.445 --> 43:00.665
Okay, go for it.

43:02.928 --> 43:04.407
What?

43:04.494 --> 43:06.540
Bella said we should
go with our instinct,

43:06.671 --> 43:09.499
and I just...
I feel like this one isn't it.

43:09.630 --> 43:11.980
Hold on.

43:15.331 --> 43:17.029
Ooh, you and dad only liked
Sweet Rose

43:17.159 --> 43:19.248
because they had that gross
pickle-flavored ice cream.

43:19.335 --> 43:21.207
What was it called?

43:21.337 --> 43:24.384
Number 23. The Big Dill.

43:27.735 --> 43:30.390
Oh, my God. It worked!

43:30.520 --> 43:31.521
Worked.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.091
Mom, these must have been
the DMs

43:36.178 --> 43:39.051
that Annie was trying to hide.

43:39.138 --> 43:41.619
"Nobody wants you here"?

43:41.706 --> 43:44.534
"I wish you were dead"?

43:44.622 --> 43:46.885
Mom.

43:46.972 --> 43:49.931
Will you print--print
this conversation, please?

43:54.196 --> 43:55.545
Well, it's not
in my jurisdiction,

43:55.633 --> 43:58.853
so, you know,
my hands are tied.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.115
Detective.

44:01.421 --> 44:02.596
Detective?

44:02.683 --> 44:04.424
Oh, Ms. Baker.

44:04.511 --> 44:06.034
You need to question
Annie Dolan.

44:06.121 --> 44:07.557
Who?

44:07.645 --> 44:10.212
Lauren?
My daughter's roommate.

44:10.299 --> 44:12.693
Oh, yeah, we did.
We took her statement.

44:12.780 --> 44:15.087
Like I said before,
no evidence of foul play.

44:15.174 --> 44:16.175
Well, Annie has been

44:16.262 --> 44:18.220
cyberbullying my daughter
for months,

44:18.307 --> 44:21.049
including messages
with direct physical threat.

44:21.180 --> 44:23.095
How'd you get these?

44:23.225 --> 44:25.532
We gained access to her account.

44:25.619 --> 44:29.231
I need someone to take
my daughter's case seriously.

44:29.362 --> 44:33.105
Detective,
I need you to do more.

44:43.637 --> 44:46.292
Those look familiar to you?

44:46.379 --> 44:48.120
The coincidence I'm finding

44:48.250 --> 44:51.514
is that you spent months
cyberbullying Lauren,

44:51.601 --> 44:54.039
and then she disappeared.

44:54.126 --> 44:55.649
I had nothing to do
with Lauren disappearing.

44:55.736 --> 45:00.262
I-I wasn't even here
that weekend.

45:00.349 --> 45:03.831
Look, I swear on my life.
I swear on everything.

45:03.962 --> 45:06.486
I-I don't know
what happened to Lauren.

45:14.450 --> 45:17.497
-Elisa, hi.
-Hey.

45:17.584 --> 45:21.414
Um, So I spoke with BVPD,
and I wanted to make sure

45:21.501 --> 45:23.155
that you heard
as soon as possible.

45:23.242 --> 45:24.983
Detective Dean--
he re-interviewed Annie,

45:25.070 --> 45:26.811
and her alibi checks out.

45:26.898 --> 45:28.638
She was at some
fancy ski resort.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.118
She wasn't even in the state

45:30.205 --> 45:31.424
at the time
of Lauren's disappearance.

45:37.299 --> 45:39.258
What about the manager--Eddie?

45:39.345 --> 45:40.607
Mr. Brick?

45:40.694 --> 45:43.828
He, uh, apparently spent
the night in a drunk tank.

45:43.915 --> 45:46.874
He got handsy at a strip club.
Bouncer roughed him up.

45:46.961 --> 45:49.224
So that explains the black eye.

45:49.355 --> 45:52.053
He is a sleazeball, and he
should definitely be fired.

45:52.140 --> 45:54.142
But, you know,
it's highly unlikely

45:54.229 --> 45:56.666
that he or Annie were involved
in Lauren's disappearance.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.320
So I'm back to the beginning

45:58.407 --> 46:01.541
and nowhere closer
to finding where my daughter is.

46:01.628 --> 46:04.544
I really am sorry, Mrs. Baker.

46:04.674 --> 46:07.286
I wish I had better news.

46:10.376 --> 46:12.900
Thank you.

46:13.031 --> 46:16.164
-Lauren!
-Lauren!

46:16.295 --> 46:18.036
Lauren!

46:18.123 --> 46:20.603
Lauren?!

46:20.690 --> 46:21.779
Lauren!

46:21.866 --> 46:22.780
Lauren!

46:22.867 --> 46:25.521
Cheryl...

46:25.608 --> 46:27.741
it is getting awfully late.

46:27.828 --> 46:30.091
I think we have to
call it for the night.

46:30.178 --> 46:34.661
Susan, thank you for coming.
Okay? You can go home.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.445
No, no, no. No way.

46:36.532 --> 46:40.101
Hey, you haven't slept
in almost two weeks.

46:40.188 --> 46:42.974
-Just call it for tonight.
-I can't.

46:43.104 --> 46:45.933
I can't. My daughter
told me she was depressed,

46:46.020 --> 46:48.849
and I was too afraid to listen.

46:48.936 --> 46:50.895
-What if she came out here to--
-Hey.

46:50.982 --> 46:55.551
If you feel it in your gut,
Lauren is still out there.

46:55.638 --> 46:57.945
Just stop for the night.

46:58.032 --> 46:59.642
Susan...

46:59.729 --> 47:02.776
please go home.

47:02.907 --> 47:05.126
-Go home.
-Okay.

47:05.213 --> 47:08.477
Lauren!

47:10.523 --> 47:12.742
Lauren!

47:12.873 --> 47:15.658
Lauren?!

47:15.745 --> 47:18.618
-Lauren!
-Lauren?

47:18.748 --> 47:20.315
-Lauren!
-Lauren!

47:20.402 --> 47:22.448
Lauren!

47:57.222 --> 47:59.659
Annie?

47:59.746 --> 48:01.530
Annie? Annie!

48:01.617 --> 48:03.532
Leave me alone!

48:03.619 --> 48:06.318
Annie, I just
want to talk to you!

48:09.625 --> 48:12.541
Annie...
I just need a minute.

48:12.628 --> 48:14.892
Please.

48:14.979 --> 48:16.763
Annie--

48:16.850 --> 48:19.287
I'm not supposed to speak
to you. I'll call the cops.

48:19.374 --> 48:22.377
I believe you weren't involved
in Lauren's disappearance.

48:22.464 --> 48:24.292
Then why are you following me?

48:24.379 --> 48:27.774
I just want to understand what
was going on with my daughter.

48:29.123 --> 48:31.909
Can we just
take one minute to talk?

48:34.302 --> 48:36.435
After the first few months,

48:36.522 --> 48:38.741
Lauren got
really moody and quiet.

48:38.828 --> 48:42.397
She was always in our room,
buried in her phone or computer.

48:42.484 --> 48:45.270
And I take it
that was a problem for you?

48:45.357 --> 48:46.662
Yeah. It got so annoying
'cause I couldn't have

48:46.749 --> 48:48.969
any friends over or guys

48:49.100 --> 48:52.103
'cause she was just like this
gloomy cloud, constantly there.

48:56.672 --> 48:58.631
I mean, looking back,
it should have been obvious

48:58.761 --> 49:00.415
that she was just
super depressed.

49:03.375 --> 49:04.942
I missed it, too.

49:08.858 --> 49:12.079
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Baker.

49:12.166 --> 49:15.604
I know you probably
can't forgive me, but...

49:15.691 --> 49:18.085
I really do hope
that Lauren is okay.

49:19.826 --> 49:21.697
You're right.

49:21.784 --> 49:25.919
I can't forgive you for
the way you treated my daughter,

49:26.006 --> 49:28.313
but maybe now you can help us.

49:28.443 --> 49:30.228
How?

49:30.358 --> 49:31.794
Maybe there's
something you didn't think of

49:31.881 --> 49:33.927
that's actually useful.

49:34.058 --> 49:36.582
I mean, is there anyone

49:36.669 --> 49:39.933
that you think Lauren could have
gone out to meet that night?

49:40.064 --> 49:42.980
Well, she really
didn't have any friends.

49:45.112 --> 49:49.116
What about...
a professor or a crush?

49:51.205 --> 49:53.120
Well, there was this one guy.

49:53.207 --> 49:55.470
Who? Was he a student?

49:55.601 --> 49:58.343
No, no, I think Lauren met him
on a dating site or something.

49:58.473 --> 50:01.781
Crap.
What was his name? Brian?

50:04.566 --> 50:07.308
Ian. That was it.

50:12.183 --> 50:13.532
Ian.

50:18.928 --> 50:20.017
Marley!

50:20.104 --> 50:22.671
Mom. Finally, you're back.

50:22.802 --> 50:25.109
-We found an Ian.
-Already?

50:25.196 --> 50:26.458
The Sleuths found this guy
who'd been commenting

50:26.545 --> 50:29.330
on all of Lauren's picks on this
dating site called Yearning,

50:29.417 --> 50:31.941
until his account
mysteriously deactivated

50:32.029 --> 50:34.770
the day
after Lauren disappeared.

50:34.901 --> 50:35.902
Look.

50:39.079 --> 50:40.820
Have you and the Sleuths
found anything else

50:40.907 --> 50:43.562
on Ian Turner?
-Not yet.

50:43.692 --> 50:45.825
The main problem is that his
IP address is based in Latvia.

50:45.912 --> 50:48.828
Latvia?
That's thousands of miles away.

50:48.915 --> 50:50.177
That can't be the right person.

50:50.308 --> 50:52.745
He's probably using a VPN
to cover his real location.

50:52.875 --> 50:55.835
He could actually
just be down the street.

50:55.922 --> 50:57.967
Well, that's sus.

50:58.098 --> 51:01.275
Are there any private messages
on the site?

51:01.362 --> 51:04.278
Yes, but try logging in
with Lauren's IG password.

51:04.409 --> 51:05.584
You'd be surprised
how many people

51:05.671 --> 51:07.455
use the same one for everything.
Total hacker bait.

51:07.542 --> 51:10.067
Okay.

51:12.939 --> 51:13.983
Got it.

51:14.114 --> 51:15.507
Um...

51:15.637 --> 51:18.118
-No sign of Ian.
-No.

51:18.249 --> 51:20.120
But if he deactivated
his account,

51:20.251 --> 51:22.079
his messages
would have erased, right?

51:22.209 --> 51:23.950
Right, but there's a trick.

51:24.081 --> 51:25.691
Try downloading
Lauren's account data.

51:25.821 --> 51:28.520
Even deleted messages
should appear in the archive.

51:28.607 --> 51:32.089
There it is.

51:34.265 --> 51:36.658
"I feel so lonely here.

51:36.789 --> 51:40.445
You're the only one
who understands me"?

51:44.057 --> 51:45.406
Looks like Ian was supposed

51:45.493 --> 51:47.930
to pick up Lauren at Crowley.

51:48.017 --> 51:50.019
That's right behind
the woods in Canning.

51:50.107 --> 51:53.240
So that means
that she didleave on her own.

51:53.327 --> 51:55.764
Yeah, but it looks like she
wasn't supposed to be staying.

51:55.895 --> 51:57.288
-It says a few days.
-Right.

51:57.375 --> 52:00.247
But that still doesn't explain
why her phone is turned off.

52:00.378 --> 52:01.988
Or the fact that her debit card

52:02.119 --> 52:03.511
hasn't been used
in almost two weeks.

52:03.598 --> 52:04.599
Exactly.

52:04.686 --> 52:08.299
-We can find this guy, Mom.
-Yeah.

52:08.386 --> 52:11.737
It's just like you said.
If we find Ian...

52:11.824 --> 52:14.000
We find Lauren.

52:16.263 --> 52:18.309
Imagine being Jessica's mom.

52:18.439 --> 52:21.442
How frustrated would you be?
I mean, in my opinion,

52:21.529 --> 52:23.575
I feel like we're seeing this
way too often...

52:23.662 --> 52:25.490
I reverse-searched
the logo on his shirt.

52:25.620 --> 52:27.405
It's from Record Outlet,
a town over.

52:27.535 --> 52:28.580
Is that how you found out where
Ian worked?

52:28.667 --> 52:30.190
Obviously...

52:30.277 --> 52:32.714
Sort of. They don't sell
the shirt online,

52:32.845 --> 52:35.456
so I figured
he has to be an employee.

52:35.587 --> 52:36.675
But don't think
it's happening. It's been--

52:36.805 --> 52:38.503
Good job, Detective Marley.

52:38.633 --> 52:39.547
Okay.

52:45.074 --> 52:47.686
...Jessica,
but this is a cold case, and...

53:31.991 --> 53:34.036
Excuse me.

53:34.123 --> 53:37.953
I'm, uh, looking for an album
for my--my husband.

53:38.084 --> 53:40.782
Teddy Pendergrass.
The "TP" album?

53:40.869 --> 53:44.133
Well...
this is our R&B section.

53:44.264 --> 53:45.657
We also have
another R&B section in the back.

53:45.744 --> 53:48.964
Uh...

53:49.095 --> 53:50.792
You look familiar.
What's your name?

53:50.923 --> 53:54.318
Charlie.

53:55.928 --> 53:57.843
Are you a student
at Canning College?

53:57.930 --> 54:00.889
No, UT alum, actually.

54:00.976 --> 54:02.717
Do you work at Canning?

54:02.848 --> 54:06.721
My daughter is a student there.

54:06.852 --> 54:08.636
Her name's Lauren.

54:08.767 --> 54:11.160
Awesome.

54:11.248 --> 54:16.557
Anyways, if you need anything,
you let me know.

54:16.688 --> 54:19.821
Uh, Charlie, is it? Um...

54:19.952 --> 54:22.955
Do you recognize
the name Ian Turner?

54:23.042 --> 54:25.436
No, sorry.

54:35.968 --> 54:37.491
Where'd you get this?

54:37.622 --> 54:40.102
I think someone's using
your picture to, uh,

54:40.189 --> 54:42.844
catfish some young women
on the Internet.

54:45.282 --> 54:48.154
I had nothing to do with this,
I swear.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.504
Do you know anybody
who would do this?

54:50.635 --> 54:52.376
Do you remember anybody
taking your picture?

54:52.463 --> 54:55.117
Has anybody been in here
that's been suspicious?

54:55.248 --> 54:57.859
I don't know. I...I'm sorry.

54:57.990 --> 55:01.776
If I could help you more,
I-I would.

55:01.863 --> 55:03.474
But I will file a police report.

55:07.434 --> 55:09.044
Elisa, you got the lead-in
for the mayoral debate for me?

55:09.131 --> 55:10.176
Uh, yeah, almost.
Sorry, I'm just--

55:10.263 --> 55:12.483
I'm running a little bit behind.
-What is that?

55:14.920 --> 55:17.226
Missing Persons Database?

55:17.357 --> 55:19.141
Is this about
the Baker girl again?

55:19.228 --> 55:20.795
I think
there's a story here, Russ.

55:20.882 --> 55:24.146
No. One girl went missing
in a whole town of problems,

55:24.277 --> 55:25.452
and there are no viable leads.

55:25.539 --> 55:27.498
Elisa, move on.

55:27.628 --> 55:30.022
But it is not just one girl.

55:30.109 --> 55:31.676
Russ, Russ, look at this.
Look at this.

55:31.806 --> 55:32.981
Half a dozen
Black and Brown women

55:33.112 --> 55:34.809
between the ages of 18 and 30--

55:34.940 --> 55:38.335
they've gone missing in
this area in the last two years.

55:39.858 --> 55:41.512
Half a dozen.

55:44.732 --> 55:48.867
So...what, do you think
we have a serial killer?

55:48.954 --> 55:52.610
Yes,
and/or multiple systemic issues

55:52.740 --> 55:55.090
that are failing these women--
these women--

55:55.221 --> 55:56.962
these women of color.

55:57.092 --> 55:58.529
And with the cops,

55:58.659 --> 56:00.574
they--they obviously don't
take these cases seriously.

56:00.661 --> 56:02.141
Look, Elisa,

56:02.228 --> 56:04.622
I know how much you care about
this case, but I don't have to

56:04.709 --> 56:07.407
remind you how much national
is focused on Jessica Russo.

56:07.494 --> 56:09.278
But if we spoke to national
and we told them--

56:09.366 --> 56:11.193
You don't think I've tried?

56:11.280 --> 56:15.110
Dozens of newsworthy stories
cross my desk each week--

56:15.197 --> 56:19.201
stories like this one
that deserve attention.

56:19.288 --> 56:22.291
But you know news isn't news
anymore. It's ratings.

56:22.422 --> 56:23.771
And the public goes nuts

56:23.858 --> 56:27.993
for a pretty little blonde girl
like Jessica. I'm sorry.

56:28.123 --> 56:31.649
And no one cares
about a missing Black girl.

56:44.575 --> 56:46.272
Elisa.

56:49.580 --> 56:50.929
We were just coming to see you.

56:51.016 --> 56:53.105
-Now is not a good time. I'm--
-No, but we found out who Lauren

56:53.235 --> 56:54.759
went to see
the night she disappeared.

56:54.889 --> 56:56.804
Then you should go
to the police. Okay?

56:56.935 --> 56:58.197
We already called
Detective Dean,

56:58.327 --> 56:59.764
and we got his voicemail again.

56:59.851 --> 57:01.635
Elisa, we need your help.

57:01.722 --> 57:03.158
I thought
you understood as a mom.

57:03.245 --> 57:07.119
You are not the only people
in Blue Valley who need help.

57:07.206 --> 57:08.599
All right?

57:11.166 --> 57:13.952
Listen, I...I understand
that the authorities--

57:14.039 --> 57:17.782
they are not moving as quickly
as you would like, but please.

57:17.912 --> 57:19.566
Be patient.

57:19.653 --> 57:21.133
If you guys go rogue, you could

57:21.263 --> 57:23.352
jeopardize
the entire investigation.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.529
What investigation?

57:31.143 --> 57:35.539
I'm really sorry
that I couldn't help more.

57:37.279 --> 57:38.846
We are not
going to listen to her.

57:38.933 --> 57:40.631
No.

57:53.774 --> 57:55.907
My uncle's on the force.

57:56.037 --> 57:58.170
Cops don't ever think
they'll find that Baker girl.

58:00.433 --> 58:02.479
Shut up, Josh.

58:04.959 --> 58:06.352
Make me.

58:15.100 --> 58:17.232
Oh! Aah!

58:17.319 --> 58:18.799
Yo, what the hell?!

58:18.930 --> 58:21.062
-Aah!
-Are you okay?

58:21.149 --> 58:23.630
No, I'm not okay!

58:26.111 --> 58:28.853
Oh, my eyes.

58:36.382 --> 58:37.949
You can't let
your emotions control you.

58:38.079 --> 58:40.125
God, you are
so obsessed with being polite

58:40.212 --> 58:41.518
and perfect all the time.

58:41.648 --> 58:43.520
That's why
you ignore glaring realities

58:43.650 --> 58:45.739
like Lauren was depressed
for months, Mom.

58:45.826 --> 58:47.915
-That's not fair--
-Excuse me.

58:48.046 --> 58:51.223
Sorry.
Am I interrupting family hour?

58:51.353 --> 58:54.008
Well, we have good news on Josh.

58:54.139 --> 58:57.229
Apparently, the liquid
that Marley threw in his face

58:57.359 --> 58:59.753
is nothing more
than sodium chloride,

58:59.840 --> 59:02.147
which is
another word for salt water.

59:02.234 --> 59:04.279
Nurse says Josh
is going to be just fine.

59:04.366 --> 59:07.631
I'm glad he's going to be okay.
Marley is truly sorry,

59:07.761 --> 59:09.894
and I can assure you
this will not happen again.

59:10.024 --> 59:12.331
Yes, well,
I guess a 2-week suspension

59:12.461 --> 59:14.376
will help that message sink in.

59:14.463 --> 59:17.336
Two weeks? For spraying him
with salt water?

59:17.466 --> 59:21.427
Marley, what you did technically
counts as an assault. Okay?

59:21.514 --> 59:23.385
You're lucky the parents
aren't pressing charges.

59:25.562 --> 59:26.563
Fine.

59:30.915 --> 59:33.091
A 2-week suspension is going to
go on her record permanently.

59:34.309 --> 59:36.094
You don't think
that's a little harsh,

59:36.224 --> 59:38.313
considering the--
the circumstances?

59:38.400 --> 59:40.925
Cheryl, I'm sorry,
but I can't make exceptions

59:41.012 --> 59:42.579
for a kid just 'cause
they're having troubles at home.

59:42.709 --> 59:44.319
Well, you didn't mind
making exceptions

59:44.450 --> 59:46.539
when I reported Josh's behavior.

59:46.626 --> 59:47.758
That was
a different circumstance.

59:47.888 --> 59:52.284
Why? Because he's white,
and my daughter is Black?

59:52.371 --> 59:54.286
Cheryl, I can assure you, okay,

59:54.416 --> 59:56.897
I make all of
my disciplinary decisions

59:57.028 --> 59:59.770
on a strictly colorblind basis.

59:59.857 --> 1:00:01.423
Okay, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

1:00:01.510 --> 1:00:04.078
What about--what about
if we--if we made it

1:00:04.165 --> 1:00:06.864
a detention instead?
Then we give her a week.

1:00:06.951 --> 1:00:07.995
That way,
Marley still learns her lesson,

1:00:08.126 --> 1:00:10.171
and--and nothing goes
on her permanent record.

1:00:10.302 --> 1:00:13.087
We could do that.

1:00:15.655 --> 1:00:17.614
-Thank you.
-Okay.

1:00:20.921 --> 1:00:24.055
I'm so glad your dad
let you come over.

1:00:24.142 --> 1:00:26.884
I cannot find another profile
with Ian Turner.

1:00:26.971 --> 1:00:28.494
I swear. I have carpal tunnel
from swiping.

1:00:28.581 --> 1:00:30.975
Swipe no more.

1:00:31.105 --> 1:00:33.194
I created a bot
that'll trawl your name.

1:00:33.281 --> 1:00:36.067
If Ian's using a different
profile, this will find him.

1:00:36.154 --> 1:00:38.156
Whoa. Girl, it is so cool

1:00:38.286 --> 1:00:40.637
that you know
how to do all this stuff.

1:00:40.724 --> 1:00:43.161
Yeah, well, I was a loser
in residence in my school.

1:00:43.291 --> 1:00:44.728
It's not like I'm busy
getting invited

1:00:44.858 --> 1:00:46.643
to football games or keggers.

1:00:49.297 --> 1:00:51.256
Hey,
wanna see something funny?

1:00:51.343 --> 1:00:52.910
The BVH football team?

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:54.825
Drumroll, please.

1:00:54.955 --> 1:00:56.391
Oh, my God.

1:00:56.478 --> 1:00:59.003
-You hacked our school website?
-"Hacked" is such a strong word.

1:00:59.133 --> 1:01:00.961
I just took
a few lines of code.

1:01:01.048 --> 1:01:04.922
Aw. I kind of like
baby body Josh.

1:01:06.750 --> 1:01:09.361
Wait. I think I found him.

1:01:09.491 --> 1:01:11.232
Ian Turner?

1:01:11.363 --> 1:01:13.495
Well, on this profile,
he goes by Robert Gregory,

1:01:13.626 --> 1:01:15.889
but it's the same photo,
same location.

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:19.806
Holy shit. Bella,
that has to be the catfish.

1:01:19.937 --> 1:01:21.242
But what do we do?
I can't make my own account.

1:01:21.373 --> 1:01:22.896
He'll recognize my name.

1:01:23.027 --> 1:01:26.030
No, you got
to create a fake profile.

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:28.423
Something this creep
will be into.

1:01:28.510 --> 1:01:29.686
Someone like Lauren.

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:13.425
"Black and Missing Foundation."

1:02:19.997 --> 1:02:25.045
Yes.
I'd like to speak to...Loretta.

1:02:33.053 --> 1:02:34.098
Oh, my God.

1:03:21.145 --> 1:03:21.754
Cheryl.

1:03:21.841 --> 1:03:23.277
Loretta.

1:03:23.364 --> 1:03:26.150
Give me a hug. Oh. Mm.

1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:28.108
Thank you for coming so quickly.

1:03:28.195 --> 1:03:29.980
Oh, I'm not far, and besides,

1:03:30.110 --> 1:03:31.242
that's
Black and Missing's motto--

1:03:31.372 --> 1:03:33.984
"Help Us Find Us."

1:03:34.114 --> 1:03:36.813
I'm so sorry your family's
going through this.

1:03:38.858 --> 1:03:40.425
How have you been holding up?

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:43.210
Just...barely.

1:03:43.297 --> 1:03:45.125
If I didn't have Marley
to take care of,

1:03:45.212 --> 1:03:46.605
I don't know
what else I would do.

1:03:46.692 --> 1:03:48.607
Oh, that's why I'm here.

1:03:48.737 --> 1:03:50.957
So, have you thought about
doing any community events,

1:03:51.088 --> 1:03:54.700
like maybe a candlelight vigil?

1:03:54.787 --> 1:03:56.920
I mean, we're new in town.

1:03:57.050 --> 1:03:58.312
I mean, I don't know
how much of a community

1:03:58.443 --> 1:04:00.010
there is that would show up.

1:04:00.140 --> 1:04:02.839
I mean,
when Lauren went missing,

1:04:02.926 --> 1:04:05.363
I just hoped that there'd be
detectives combing the streets

1:04:05.450 --> 1:04:09.889
and her picture would be
on every news channel.

1:04:09.976 --> 1:04:12.849
But now I know what the world
thinks of my daughter.

1:04:12.979 --> 1:04:15.199
She's just another statistic.

1:04:17.070 --> 1:04:19.943
That's a lot of heaviness
you're holding in.

1:04:20.030 --> 1:04:22.859
You got anybody you can
talk to about these feelings?

1:04:22.946 --> 1:04:25.774
It used to be my husband,

1:04:25.905 --> 1:04:28.908
but now I don't want to
burden people with my problems.

1:04:28.995 --> 1:04:31.258
What about a professional?

1:04:31.389 --> 1:04:34.566
You mean...a shrink?

1:04:34.653 --> 1:04:38.309
Trauma like your family's
been through, it cuts deep.

1:04:38.439 --> 1:04:41.312
If you broke your leg, you would
go see a doctor, right?

1:04:41.442 --> 1:04:44.924
Yeah, but I respect that
therapy works for other people,

1:04:45.011 --> 1:04:47.927
but that's not how
I handle my problems.

1:04:48.014 --> 1:04:50.321
I hear you. You know,
my mother used to say,

1:04:50.451 --> 1:04:54.238
"All you need is prayer
and some gumption."

1:04:54.325 --> 1:04:58.416
Keep your head down low
and push through your pain.

1:04:58.546 --> 1:05:00.679
But, you know,
times have changed.

1:05:00.766 --> 1:05:04.161
It is not a sign of weakness
to admit that you need help.

1:05:04.248 --> 1:05:08.817
That takes strength,
especially from folks like us.

1:05:08.905 --> 1:05:10.297
I don't know.
Sitting in a chair

1:05:10.384 --> 1:05:13.605
whining about my feelings is not
going to bring my daughter home.

1:05:13.692 --> 1:05:17.130
Cheryl, this fight is
going to stretch and pull you

1:05:17.217 --> 1:05:18.610
to your limit.

1:05:18.697 --> 1:05:21.221
You got to take care
of yourself, too.

1:05:21.308 --> 1:05:23.310
You won't do
your daughter any good

1:05:23.397 --> 1:05:25.573
if you're
broken up into pieces.

1:05:56.735 --> 1:05:59.477
"Where...do...you...live?"

1:06:01.044 --> 1:06:03.829
Come on.
Say something.

1:06:05.787 --> 1:06:07.311
Why isn't he answering?

1:06:09.356 --> 1:06:11.315
Hey, honey.
I brought your favorite cookies.

1:06:11.402 --> 1:06:13.795
-You're supposed to knock, Mom.
-What are you doing?

1:06:13.882 --> 1:06:16.581
-Nothing. Just homework.
-Then just show me.

1:06:16.668 --> 1:06:18.365
Mom, it's literally nothing.

1:06:18.452 --> 1:06:20.454
Marley,
show me what you're doing.

1:06:20.541 --> 1:06:23.414
-It's just homework.
-Well, I want to see it.

1:06:23.501 --> 1:06:25.068
Show it to me.

1:06:31.161 --> 1:06:34.729
That's...Ian.
I-I mean, Charlie.

1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:37.036
How long have you been
messaging him?

1:06:37.123 --> 1:06:39.256
It's only been a few days.

1:06:39.343 --> 1:06:42.128
It was going well until...
I don't know.

1:06:42.259 --> 1:06:44.043
I asked him where he lived,
and he stopped responding.

1:06:44.130 --> 1:06:48.134
I told you to stand down.
Are you kidding?

1:06:48.265 --> 1:06:51.442
This could hurt your sister.
Marley, why don't you listen?

1:06:51.529 --> 1:06:54.053
-Anything could happen now!
-I was just trying to help.

1:06:54.140 --> 1:06:56.708
You're not helping.
That's not helping!

1:07:27.956 --> 1:07:29.523
Mom?

1:07:30.785 --> 1:07:32.309
Marley.

1:07:33.571 --> 1:07:34.789
Hi.

1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:36.965
Mom...

1:07:37.053 --> 1:07:40.534
I'll never forgive myself if--
if I got Lauren...

1:07:41.970 --> 1:07:45.887
-You didn't.
-You said...

1:07:45.974 --> 1:07:48.107
You said--You said I did.

1:07:48.238 --> 1:07:49.543
I was angry.

1:07:49.630 --> 1:07:51.850
And I'm scared.

1:07:51.937 --> 1:07:54.635
I'm so sorry I said those things
to Principal Shepherd about you.

1:07:54.722 --> 1:07:55.854
I never meant any of them.

1:07:55.984 --> 1:07:56.768
-Yeah, you did.
-No, I don't think that, though.

1:07:56.855 --> 1:07:58.552
Yeah, you do.

1:07:58.639 --> 1:08:00.772
I get it.

1:08:03.166 --> 1:08:06.865
When I was your age,
I had to fight for everything.

1:08:06.952 --> 1:08:08.519
And I thought
the only way I could do it

1:08:08.649 --> 1:08:11.478
is by being...perfect.

1:08:11.609 --> 1:08:14.742
And I know--I know I'm hard
on you and your sister, but...

1:08:16.613 --> 1:08:20.226
It's just because
I see so much potential in you.

1:08:20.313 --> 1:08:23.011
So I'm sorry.

1:08:23.142 --> 1:08:25.405
You don't have to be sorry, Mom.

1:08:53.825 --> 1:08:58.743
I so appreciate you guys
coming out and supporting.

1:09:00.265 --> 1:09:02.398
I thought more people
would come.

1:09:02.529 --> 1:09:04.227
It's still early.

1:09:04.314 --> 1:09:08.100
So what's
with the police presence?

1:09:08.187 --> 1:09:09.580
Oh, pay them no mind.

1:09:09.710 --> 1:09:12.712
If they were doing their jobs,
we wouldn't have to be here.

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.149
-Right?
-Right.

1:09:14.237 --> 1:09:15.368
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:09:15.455 --> 1:09:18.458
And here we are.

1:09:18.545 --> 1:09:20.112
When the road is long...

1:09:20.243 --> 1:09:22.636
When the road is long...

1:09:22.723 --> 1:09:24.943
- Look.
- ...standing strong.

1:09:25.030 --> 1:09:27.119
When we walk together...

1:09:27.250 --> 1:09:28.685
When we walk together...

1:09:28.816 --> 1:09:31.078
- ...we hold on together.
- ...we hold on together.

1:09:31.210 --> 1:09:33.211
When we fight together...

1:09:33.299 --> 1:09:34.431
When we fight together...

1:09:34.518 --> 1:09:35.867
...we keep standing strong.

1:09:35.996 --> 1:09:37.260
...we keep standing strong.

1:09:37.389 --> 1:09:38.696
We keep standing strong.

1:09:38.782 --> 1:09:39.871
We keep standing strong.

1:09:40.001 --> 1:09:41.481
We keep standing strong!

1:09:41.612 --> 1:09:42.916
We keep standing strong!

1:09:43.004 --> 1:09:44.309
When the night is dark...

1:09:44.397 --> 1:09:45.181
When the night is dark...

1:09:45.310 --> 1:09:46.356
...we will shine our light!

1:09:46.486 --> 1:09:47.966
...we will shine our light!

1:09:48.053 --> 1:09:49.488
When the road is long...

1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:51.012
When the road is long...

1:09:51.143 --> 1:09:53.145
-...we will keep stepping on!
-...we will keep stepping on.

1:09:53.232 --> 1:09:55.278
-We need you, Lord!
-We need you, Lord!

1:09:55.365 --> 1:09:57.932
-We need you, Lord!
-We need you, Lord!

1:09:58.063 --> 1:10:00.326
-When the road is long...
-When the road is long...

1:10:00.413 --> 1:10:03.155
-...we will keep stepping on.
-...we will keep stepping on.

1:10:03.286 --> 1:10:05.505
-When the night is dark...
-When the night is dark...

1:10:05.592 --> 1:10:08.594
-...we will shine our light.
-...we will shine our light.

1:10:08.682 --> 1:10:12.032
-We will keep standing strong!
-We will keep standing strong!

1:10:16.864 --> 1:10:18.996
Mrs. Baker?
I'm Pastor Lewis Cartwell.

1:10:19.084 --> 1:10:20.389
Hi.

1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:23.306
We heard about this
from social media,

1:10:23.436 --> 1:10:25.264
and this congregation
drove in from Oklahoma

1:10:25.395 --> 1:10:26.874
just to support you.

1:10:27.005 --> 1:10:31.749
You all came all the way from
there for us?

1:10:31.879 --> 1:10:34.447
The youth group
even made posters.

1:10:34.534 --> 1:10:37.014
Bless you, Pastor.

1:10:37.145 --> 1:10:39.059
You're not alone.

1:10:39.147 --> 1:10:41.585
Are you ready, Miss Marley?

1:10:51.072 --> 1:10:52.987
Hi, everybody. Um...

1:10:54.641 --> 1:10:56.513
Hi, everybody.

1:10:56.643 --> 1:10:58.602
My name is Marley Baker.

1:10:58.689 --> 1:11:01.518
Lauren Baker's my sister.

1:11:01.648 --> 1:11:03.868
My big sister, actually.

1:11:03.998 --> 1:11:07.871
She is two years, eight months
and 20 days older than me,

1:11:08.002 --> 1:11:11.397
which she always reminded me.

1:11:13.094 --> 1:11:15.793
Lauren is so sweet.

1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.883
She cried at the end of every
Christmas movie...

1:11:19.013 --> 1:11:20.841
even the funny ones.

1:11:20.928 --> 1:11:23.975
She loved ranch,
but she hated mayonnaise.

1:11:24.062 --> 1:11:27.630
And Lauryn Hill
was her one true queen.

1:11:27.761 --> 1:11:31.416
My big sister is
the most caring, sweet,

1:11:31.548 --> 1:11:33.505
creative,
beautiful girl that I know.

1:11:33.593 --> 1:11:36.901
And, um...

1:11:36.987 --> 1:11:38.598
I just thought
that I would let you all know

1:11:38.728 --> 1:11:41.035
a little bit about her, too.

1:11:41.166 --> 1:11:42.994
Thank you.

1:11:52.003 --> 1:11:54.919
I'm Lauren's mom.

1:11:58.401 --> 1:12:01.795
My daughter
has been missing for 16 days.

1:12:03.884 --> 1:12:07.018
And ever since...

1:12:07.148 --> 1:12:10.848
I've been living
every parent's nightmare.

1:12:13.371 --> 1:12:16.419
We didn't feel heard.

1:12:16.549 --> 1:12:18.377
We didn't feel seen...

1:12:20.814 --> 1:12:22.076
...until now.

1:12:22.163 --> 1:12:27.778
And I want to thank
every single one of you here.

1:12:27.907 --> 1:12:32.173
And I just want to say that...

1:12:32.260 --> 1:12:34.698
I miss my baby.

1:12:37.178 --> 1:12:39.005
None of this
would have been possible

1:12:39.093 --> 1:12:43.010
without the Black and Missing
Foundation.

1:12:43.097 --> 1:12:47.188
I would like to introduce you
to Ms. Loretta Nix.

1:13:00.941 --> 1:13:01.855
Hello, everyone.

1:13:01.986 --> 1:13:04.815
My name is Loretta.

1:13:04.945 --> 1:13:09.428
And we're going to do a little
call and response, okay?

1:13:09.514 --> 1:13:11.735
And we gonna make sure
that this whole nation

1:13:11.822 --> 1:13:13.954
hears our voices.

1:13:14.041 --> 1:13:18.306
All I need y'all to say is,
"Do more."

1:13:18.394 --> 1:13:19.395
We can...

1:13:19.482 --> 1:13:20.874
Do more.

1:13:21.005 --> 1:13:22.398
We will...

1:13:22.485 --> 1:13:23.181
Do more.

1:13:23.268 --> 1:13:25.662
- We must...
- Do more.

1:13:25.749 --> 1:13:27.272
They can...

1:13:27.403 --> 1:13:28.925
Do more.

1:13:29.013 --> 1:13:30.754
- They will...
- Do more.

1:13:30.884 --> 1:13:32.103
They must...

1:13:32.233 --> 1:13:33.147
Do more.

1:13:33.234 --> 1:13:34.452
-Do more.
-Do more.

1:13:34.584 --> 1:13:36.193
-Do more.
-Do more.

1:13:36.324 --> 1:13:37.804
-Do more.
-Do more.

1:13:37.934 --> 1:13:39.153
-Do more!
-Do more!

1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:40.459
-Do more!
-Do more!

1:13:40.590 --> 1:13:42.635
-Do more!
-Do more!

1:13:42.766 --> 1:13:44.463
-Do more!
-Do more!

1:13:44.594 --> 1:13:45.550
-Do more!
-Do more!

1:13:45.682 --> 1:13:48.075
-Do more!
-Do more!

1:13:53.907 --> 1:13:55.996
Mom!

1:13:56.083 --> 1:13:58.912
I'm coming.

1:14:01.001 --> 1:14:03.308
The station finally agreed
to run our story.

1:14:03.395 --> 1:14:05.353
Our coverage continues
with breaking news

1:14:05.441 --> 1:14:06.442
about a missing girl.
-It's on.

1:14:06.529 --> 1:14:07.878
-I can't believe it's happening.
-I know.

1:14:07.965 --> 1:14:09.835
The search is over.

1:14:09.967 --> 1:14:12.621
Jessica Russo
has been found alive.

1:14:12.752 --> 1:14:15.929
Wait, what?
What about Lauren?

1:14:16.059 --> 1:14:18.844
It is the outcome,
of course, everyone hoped for.

1:14:18.932 --> 1:14:22.240
However, there is now
a shocking new twist.

1:14:25.504 --> 1:14:27.157
Authorities now believe Jessica

1:14:27.288 --> 1:14:29.246
may have been
a voluntary runaway.

1:14:31.815 --> 1:14:33.294
She just ran away.

1:14:36.428 --> 1:14:39.823
I promise you, Cheryl,
I-I fought my ass off

1:14:39.910 --> 1:14:44.305
to give Lauren the coverage
that she deserves, but...

1:14:44.392 --> 1:14:47.700
you know, then the pretty little
blonde girl was found, so...

1:14:47.831 --> 1:14:50.398
Oh, my God.
Can you believe that no one

1:14:50.529 --> 1:14:53.924
thought to consider
that frickin' Jessica Russo

1:14:54.054 --> 1:14:55.534
might be a runaway?

1:14:55.621 --> 1:14:58.189
I'm not surprised.

1:14:58.276 --> 1:15:02.628
Cheryl, I can only imagine
what you're feeling right now,

1:15:02.715 --> 1:15:05.588
but I beg you,
don't do anything reckless.

1:15:05.675 --> 1:15:08.373
Like, trying to find Ian Turner
can be really dangerous, okay?

1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:10.505
Tell me somethin'.

1:15:10.593 --> 1:15:13.465
What would you do
if that was yourchild?

1:15:13.552 --> 1:15:16.860
I, um...

1:16:02.035 --> 1:16:04.298
How should I respond to Ian?

1:16:04.385 --> 1:16:06.996
Tell him you want
to set up a date.

1:16:07.127 --> 1:16:08.737
-Really?
-Yes.

1:16:08.825 --> 1:16:12.219
-For when?
-Today, in a public place.

1:16:12.306 --> 1:16:14.178
And I'll stake out the location.

1:16:14.308 --> 1:16:16.572
-I'll come as backup.
-No!

1:16:16.659 --> 1:16:19.400
No. I already have
one daughter in jeopardy.

1:16:19.531 --> 1:16:22.882
Promise me you will not
leave this house. Promise me.

1:16:25.014 --> 1:16:26.538
I promise.

1:16:26.625 --> 1:16:32.936
It's time we finally figure out
who this catfish really is.

1:16:39.812 --> 1:16:41.597
Are you sure this is the place?

1:16:41.684 --> 1:16:43.032
Yeah. He said he'd pick
"Kiyanah" up

1:16:43.120 --> 1:16:44.687
for a date right here.

1:16:44.773 --> 1:16:48.081
There's nothing out here.
He must have known that.

1:16:48.212 --> 1:16:49.561
Easier to hide his trail?

1:16:49.648 --> 1:16:52.216
Yep, that's what I'm thinkin'.

1:16:52.346 --> 1:16:54.740
I mean, I do see a truck.

1:16:54.871 --> 1:16:58.135
I mean, that's gotta be him.
It's a red truck.

1:16:58.222 --> 1:17:00.093
Let me give you
the license plate.

1:17:00.180 --> 1:17:05.403
DE7-C541.

1:17:11.322 --> 1:17:13.846
NetSleuth94 says

1:17:13.933 --> 1:17:15.674
that this plate was registered
as stolen,

1:17:15.761 --> 1:17:17.545
and it belongs to a sedan.

1:17:17.633 --> 1:17:20.026
Not a truck?

1:17:20.157 --> 1:17:22.638
-No.
-Okay, but it must be him.

1:17:22.768 --> 1:17:23.900
I'm going to try
and get a picture of him.

1:17:24.030 --> 1:17:25.597
Damn it! He just left.

1:17:25.684 --> 1:17:27.468
Okay, I'm going.

1:17:27.555 --> 1:17:28.600
No, Mom. Are you following him?

1:17:28.731 --> 1:17:29.818
-Call the cops.
-That wasn't a part of the plan.

1:17:29.906 --> 1:17:31.603
Call the cops.

1:17:31.690 --> 1:17:35.737
Mom. Mom! Mom!

1:18:13.732 --> 1:18:15.516
Blue Valley Police Department.

1:18:15.647 --> 1:18:19.041
Detective Dean, please.
It's urgent.

1:18:51.901 --> 1:18:53.816
Did the phishing link work?

1:18:53.946 --> 1:18:55.731
Yes, he clicked it.

1:18:55.861 --> 1:18:58.168
Now we should be able
to access his real IP address

1:18:58.255 --> 1:18:59.517
and his location.

1:20:12.155 --> 1:20:15.723
Lauren.

1:20:15.853 --> 1:20:20.293
Lauren.
Lauren, baby, it's Mom.

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:22.992
Oh, Lauren.

1:20:45.231 --> 1:20:46.710
Come on, baby.

1:20:52.978 --> 1:20:55.154
I got you.

1:21:07.601 --> 1:21:08.907
Lauren, run!

1:21:09.038 --> 1:21:11.431
Aah! Get off of me!

1:21:11.562 --> 1:21:13.303
Help!

1:21:13.389 --> 1:21:15.044
Help!

1:21:16.654 --> 1:21:19.612
Aah!

1:21:23.008 --> 1:21:24.835
Hi. You've reached Cheryl.
I can't come to the--

1:21:30.362 --> 1:21:31.495
Uhh!

1:21:45.465 --> 1:21:47.684
Lauren.

1:21:47.772 --> 1:21:49.817
Baby.

1:21:49.905 --> 1:21:53.517
Lauren. Come on, baby.

1:22:00.175 --> 1:22:01.612
Oh, gosh.

1:22:07.357 --> 1:22:09.925
Put your hands up!

1:22:10.012 --> 1:22:12.666
You're under arrest for
the abduction of Lauren Baker!

1:22:12.753 --> 1:22:17.236
Get on your knees!
Put your hands behind your back.

1:22:21.719 --> 1:22:24.156
It's okay.

1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:29.161
Take him upstairs.

1:22:31.598 --> 1:22:34.253
Lauren, you all right?

1:22:34.340 --> 1:22:37.561
You okay? Let's get you guys
inside, okay?

1:22:49.746 --> 1:22:51.662
Ow.

1:22:51.749 --> 1:22:56.232
We are deeply relieved to have
Lauren back home.

1:22:56.362 --> 1:22:57.885
Is that right?

1:22:57.973 --> 1:23:03.500
Mom, you got this, okay?
You've been prepping all week.

1:23:06.285 --> 1:23:10.637
Seriously, you've studied harder
than Peanut before a big exam.

1:23:13.291 --> 1:23:15.468
Baby, if you don't want me
to do this interview

1:23:15.555 --> 1:23:17.166
and you're not ready,
I don't have to.

1:23:17.253 --> 1:23:22.998
It's okay.
Talked to my therapist about it.

1:23:23.085 --> 1:23:25.434
I want people
to know what happened.

1:23:27.219 --> 1:23:32.181
I am so proud
of the young woman you are.

1:23:34.139 --> 1:23:36.054
And you, too.

1:23:39.231 --> 1:23:40.493
I love my girls.

1:23:40.624 --> 1:23:43.757
We love you, too.

1:23:43.844 --> 1:23:45.977
Thank you for joining us today.
We have a special guest.

1:23:46.108 --> 1:23:48.240
Her name is Cheryl Baker.

1:23:48.327 --> 1:23:50.373
She is the mother
of Lauren Baker,

1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:53.550
a young girl
who was recently abducted.

1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:55.508
You've since learned
that your daughter

1:23:55.594 --> 1:23:58.207
was not an isolated incident.

1:23:58.294 --> 1:24:01.818
In fact, your efforts
thwarted a serial predator?

1:24:01.949 --> 1:24:03.734
-That's correct, Mary.
-Mm-hmm.

1:24:03.821 --> 1:24:06.911
The police now believe
that Lauren's abductor

1:24:07.041 --> 1:24:08.695
may have been responsible
for the disappearance of

1:24:08.782 --> 1:24:12.482
six other young women
in our area.

1:24:12.568 --> 1:24:16.877
So why do you feel like Lauren
was the one that got out alive?

1:24:16.964 --> 1:24:18.357
Lauren comes
from a family of means.

1:24:18.443 --> 1:24:19.793
Mm-hmm.

1:24:19.924 --> 1:24:22.100
The other victims
were poor Black

1:24:22.187 --> 1:24:25.495
and Brown women
on the margin of society.

1:24:25.582 --> 1:24:27.714
I mean, he didn't pick
those women by accident.

1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:29.760
Hey, Russ.
Russ, check it out.

1:24:29.847 --> 1:24:31.196
But he made a big mistake

1:24:31.282 --> 1:24:32.893
underestimating
how far we would go

1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:34.678
to get Lauren's back.

1:24:34.764 --> 1:24:36.201
- Is that, uh...
- Yeah, he sure did.

1:24:36.288 --> 1:24:37.681
-Yeah.
-Well, Cheryl, tell me this.

1:24:37.768 --> 1:24:40.597
Now that Lauren's abductor
is facing a life in prison,

1:24:40.684 --> 1:24:42.990
do you feel like
you and your family
