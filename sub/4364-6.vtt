WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:05.235
Where do I stand? George is York,
Anne is my enemy and Mother
is with her.

00:05.242 --> 00:07.742
Commit to nobody until you know
there is a clear winner,

00:07.775 --> 00:10.975
and then remind them
of your undying loyalty

00:11.430 --> 00:12.988
until it serves you no more.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.668
My Father! What of Lord Warwick?

00:14.670 --> 00:17.590
On the battlefield,
Your Grace. The most noble death.

00:18.870 --> 00:20.268
I wish to see my mother.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.108
She has abandoned you
and lives in disgrace.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.188
Does Sir Henry really think
he might die?

00:25.190 --> 00:26.788
He's badly injured.

00:26.790 --> 00:29.468
Jasper plans to take
Henry into exile.

00:29.470 --> 00:31.590
Never give up. I won't.

00:33.470 --> 00:37.110
Make peace with the Yorks
and bring him home safe.

00:40.190 --> 00:43.268
George is loyal
to your husband, it seems.

00:43.270 --> 00:44.270
Today.

00:51.150 --> 00:53.108
Am I not a traitor?

00:53.110 --> 00:55.190
Do you love me and the King?

00:56.710 --> 00:58.748
Let's hope that's enough for Edward.

00:58.750 --> 01:01.908
I'll take you to your sister
when the court returns to London.

01:01.910 --> 01:04.510
I would like to see Isabel,
very, very much.

01:51.790 --> 01:53.430
Anne Neville.

02:31.550 --> 02:32.590
Your Grace.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.150
I beg for your pardon.

02:37.070 --> 02:38.590
It was not my will to betray you.

02:39.590 --> 02:43.908
My father ordered my marriage to the
son of Margaret of Anjou

02:43.910 --> 02:45.590
and she commanded that
I go with them.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.150
I had no choice but to obey.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.670
You know that Margaret of Anjou
is defeated...

03:14.110 --> 03:16.390
and will never ride out against me
again...

03:18.950 --> 03:21.390
and that her cause had no merit?

03:23.950 --> 03:24.950
I know that now.

03:28.070 --> 03:30.108
Well, that is good enough for me.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.230
I forgive you and I pardon you...

03:34.630 --> 03:37.308
and you are welcome here at Court

03:37.310 --> 03:39.030
and you may live here
with your sister.

03:46.630 --> 03:47.470
Your Grace.

03:57.710 --> 04:00.230
I am grateful for the mercy
you have shown me.

04:02.190 --> 04:05.390
My mother,
she is still in sanctuary.

04:06.710 --> 04:10.870
Indeed. And that is where
she has chosen to remain.

04:27.630 --> 04:28.710
Isabel.

04:29.950 --> 04:31.750
How merciful the King has been.

04:33.230 --> 04:36.308
You will serve as my
lady-in-waiting.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.108
You will help me
choose dresses and jewels

04:38.110 --> 04:41.108
and comb out my hair before I sleep.

04:41.110 --> 04:42.870
It'll be just like
when we were girls.

04:51.990 --> 04:55.268
Except that Mother is in prison
and Father is dead.

04:55.270 --> 04:59.348
Mother is not in prison, Anne.
She is in sanctuary.

04:59.350 --> 05:02.108
But it isn't true,
as the King claims, that she

05:02.110 --> 05:03.308
has chosen to remain there.

05:03.310 --> 05:04.388
Shhhh!

05:04.390 --> 05:08.148
Izzy, Mother keeps writing to me,
begging me to help her.

05:08.150 --> 05:10.190
As she helped you
when Father was defeated?

05:12.590 --> 05:16.230
Mother writes to me, too, Anne,
daily, and ever more beseechingly.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.110
Ignore her.

05:20.710 --> 05:24.430
The King must be in no doubt as to
where our loyalties lie.

05:26.510 --> 05:27.510
Sister.

05:29.390 --> 05:30.590
Anne is worrying so.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.868
As well she might, Isabel.
She has suffered much.

05:35.870 --> 05:38.988
Anne, you will be safe here
and well looked after.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.348
The King has appointed me
your guardian.

05:41.350 --> 05:45.988
My guardian? He cannot have
appointed you my guardian.

05:45.990 --> 05:48.708
I'm old enough to be a widow.
Why would I need a guardian?

05:48.710 --> 05:50.870
Because you're
the widow of a traitor.

06:02.270 --> 06:05.308
Edward pardoned her
without a moment's hesitation.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.468
And after what Warwick did to Father
and John...

06:07.470 --> 06:09.108
Edward did what he had to.

06:09.110 --> 06:12.388
You must begrudge Warwick's
daughters their happy reunion.

06:12.390 --> 06:15.670
England needs peace.
Everything else must be set aside.

06:32.270 --> 06:34.230
Do not stand there as if a ghost.

06:35.390 --> 06:38.310
Come! I will let you stitch
the final gold threads.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.350
Do I have a dowry, Isabel?

06:43.590 --> 06:48.950
A dowry? Are you
dreaming of marriage already, Anne?

06:50.830 --> 06:56.228
No, of course not.
I just wanted to understand.

06:56.230 --> 06:58.068
Of course you have a dowry.

06:58.070 --> 06:59.668
You mustn't worry about such things.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.228
The King has tasked George with
taking care of all financial

07:02.230 --> 07:03.550
matters on your behalf.

07:04.790 --> 07:05.750
On my behalf?

07:07.190 --> 07:09.148
When the time comes for you
to marry,

07:09.150 --> 07:11.390
George will provide
a dowry for your husband.

07:13.910 --> 07:15.110
What if I do not marry?

07:16.790 --> 07:19.668
What if Mother dies
and I am not married?

07:19.670 --> 07:21.950
What will happen
to my inheritance then?

07:23.350 --> 07:25.588
Isabel,
can't you see what they're doing?

07:25.590 --> 07:28.028
The York brothers are keeping
Mother in sanctuary

07:28.030 --> 07:30.428
so they can take
control of her fortune!

07:30.430 --> 07:32.428
What? Anne, you are quite wrong.

07:32.430 --> 07:35.228
That is why Richard brought me
here. That is

07:35.230 --> 07:37.708
why George has had himself
appointed my "guardian".

07:37.710 --> 07:39.508
It's a plot!

07:39.510 --> 07:40.868
Do not say these things!

07:40.870 --> 07:42.948
Do not speak of the sons
of York in this way.

07:42.950 --> 07:45.628
It's a plot, Isabel.
Can't you see that?

07:45.630 --> 07:47.028
Silence! You are raving!

07:47.030 --> 07:49.388
George will keep me here
until Mother dies and then...

07:49.390 --> 07:51.270
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Ow!

07:54.550 --> 07:57.790
Oh, my Lady! Oh, my Lady! My Lady!

08:08.150 --> 08:09.588
Go to your room.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.708
Isabel.

08:10.710 --> 08:12.788
Biting like a rabid dog.

08:12.790 --> 08:13.788
Isabel.

08:13.790 --> 08:16.388
You are not fit to
be in the company of ladies.

08:16.390 --> 08:18.028
Go now!

08:18.030 --> 08:22.390
And do not show your face
until you accept the situation.

08:23.750 --> 08:27.230
No, not "accept". Be thankful.

08:31.710 --> 08:37.309
With his dying breaths, my husband
told me I must reconcile with them.

08:39.950 --> 08:40.950
Must I?

08:42.789 --> 08:46.388
Is that the only way to bring my boy
safely back to England,

08:46.390 --> 08:48.230
to make peace with York?

08:53.630 --> 08:55.270
I need a sign, Father.

08:57.190 --> 09:01.390
I need a sign that even
in my weakness, God hears me...

09:05.790 --> 09:07.668
My Lady.

09:07.670 --> 09:10.188
My Lady, I did not mean to
interrupt you at prayer.

09:10.190 --> 09:11.668
Then why did you?

09:11.670 --> 09:13.868
I could not wait any longer.

09:13.870 --> 09:17.110
Your mother, Lady Beauchamp, is
gravely ill.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.670
Glory, glory, grace of God.

09:54.750 --> 09:58.028
Do not weep.
I do not deserve your tears.

09:58.030 --> 09:59.908
I do not shed any.

09:59.910 --> 10:05.548
The room lacks air. It smells sour,
of putrefying flesh.

10:05.550 --> 10:10.590
I am afraid.
Would you seek to make me more so?

10:12.030 --> 10:13.470
I seek nothing.

10:16.190 --> 10:20.670
My beloved son should be
kneeling here...

10:22.150 --> 10:24.110
pressing my hand against his lips.

10:25.710 --> 10:28.268
But there's only you, Margaret.

10:28.270 --> 10:31.390
And I will know no peace
until you forgive me.

10:32.990 --> 10:34.030
Forgive you?

10:35.430 --> 10:40.148
Absolve me from whatever crime it is
you think me guilty of.

10:40.150 --> 10:44.588
You ask me to wash you clean of sin
but you do not confess any.

10:44.590 --> 10:47.228
Is it still Holy Orders?

10:47.230 --> 10:50.868
After all these years, do
you still hate me

10:50.870 --> 10:52.988
for not sending you to an abbey?

10:52.990 --> 10:55.988
You sent a child
to do a woman's duty.

10:55.990 --> 11:01.188
Do you not understand it was God's
own will that you bear

11:01.190 --> 11:02.508
a Lancaster heir?

11:02.510 --> 11:08.148
Of course I understand.
My cause is holy, my purpose divine.

11:08.150 --> 11:10.030
I have devoted my life to it.

11:13.070 --> 11:15.950
But you only wished for the chance
to raise your son.

11:18.150 --> 11:20.310
Is that what you longed for,
Margaret?

11:22.150 --> 11:24.910
But you also wanted to
marry Jasper Tudor...

11:26.430 --> 11:28.068
to be adored.

11:28.070 --> 11:33.190
How you must struggle to reconcile
your saintliness with your vanity.

11:36.550 --> 11:37.590
Such vanity.

11:40.030 --> 11:43.028
You wanted to marry for love.

11:43.030 --> 11:45.870
And what good, pray, would that
have done your cause?

11:47.350 --> 11:52.470
You should be grateful.
I saved you from yourself.

12:05.870 --> 12:08.788
God will take you on this
Sabbath Day.

12:08.790 --> 12:12.190
And when he does, I will be reborn.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.230
Margaret.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.310
Margaret!

12:25.110 --> 12:26.270
Aww.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.030
Come here, my Prince.

12:33.990 --> 12:37.308
It won't be so very long before
we see him settled at Ludlow.

12:37.310 --> 12:38.590
Ludlow Castle?

12:39.710 --> 12:41.748
Are we to live in Wales?

12:41.750 --> 12:45.230
But we won't, but our son will
when he's two.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.588
He's the Prince of Wales.

12:48.590 --> 12:50.428
He must establish his own
household there.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.308
And what possible use has
Wales for an infant prince?

12:53.310 --> 12:56.188
The people must know him
from childhood, Your Grace.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.508
That way, they'll learn to love him

12:58.510 --> 13:01.548
and that's how we'll break Welsh
loyalty to the Tudors.

13:01.550 --> 13:05.268
No. I'm not letting go of my son.

13:05.270 --> 13:08.828
This is what it means to have a
Prince and not a girl.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.708
It is simply a matter of choosing
the right guardian for our son.

13:11.710 --> 13:13.748
Then I will appoint his guardian.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.388
I'm his mother,
and if he is to leave me,

13:15.390 --> 13:17.148
then I will choose into whose care
he goes

13:17.150 --> 13:18.588
and who will raise him into a man.

13:18.590 --> 13:22.268
It is not simply a matter
of raising him into a man. It's a

13:22.270 --> 13:24.508
matter of raising him into a King.

13:24.510 --> 13:26.550
And on that,
you are probably not best placed.

13:34.550 --> 13:35.550
You may not leave.

13:53.430 --> 13:55.030
I'll have you both. How about me?

14:02.470 --> 14:06.668
Summer. A time for mindless pleasure.

14:06.670 --> 14:10.188
Precious little is mindless where
George is concerned.

14:10.190 --> 14:13.750
He will have nothing,
nothing at all to do with my son.

14:15.430 --> 14:17.908
Does George intend to harm the boy?

14:17.910 --> 14:18.910
I don't know.

14:19.910 --> 14:25.108
Perhaps it's nothing more than the
pain of being made to part with him.

14:25.110 --> 14:28.830
When you married into the Royal
House, their customs became yours.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.108
You understand
that as surely as Edward does.

14:33.110 --> 14:35.388
I don't know what he understands.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.908
I only know that the closer
he gets to his brothers,

14:37.910 --> 14:40.388
the further he feels from me.

14:40.390 --> 14:43.390
Truly, Mother, we are distant.
Ever since...

14:47.110 --> 14:49.868
Ever since he came back from battle.

14:49.870 --> 14:51.390
Not entirely distant, I think.

14:53.550 --> 14:57.030
Mother, how... How did you know?

14:58.270 --> 15:01.428
Your husband
is as fertile as a bull.

15:01.430 --> 15:05.508
Whenever he returns from victory,
a child is never far behind.

15:05.510 --> 15:06.828
I haven't told him yet.

15:06.830 --> 15:08.310
Then tell him!

15:10.070 --> 15:13.750
Leave your cares with me and take
your happy news to your husband.

15:15.070 --> 15:17.550
Thank you. Thank you, Mother.

15:19.070 --> 15:20.030
You cheered me.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.788
Although I think I quite
exhausted you.

15:27.790 --> 15:29.508
Of course you haven't.
You never could.

15:29.510 --> 15:32.270
Go. Go! Go!

16:02.870 --> 16:05.670
Elizabeth.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.948
Jane Shore.
Her name is all around the Court.

16:12.950 --> 16:14.308
And what does that afford her?

16:14.310 --> 16:16.788
I don't know.
That's what I'm trying to find out.

16:16.790 --> 16:19.388
Have you tried asking Edward?

16:19.390 --> 16:20.548
And what should I say?

16:20.550 --> 16:23.148
What on earth is there to say?

16:23.150 --> 16:26.788
Your husband is a King with
a King's appetites.

16:26.790 --> 16:29.070
This is his nature, as you have
always known.

16:30.630 --> 16:35.788
Whoring is merely a sport to Edward,
as hunting is or jousting.

16:35.790 --> 16:37.028
She is different.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.908
She is no different.
You are the Queen.

16:39.910 --> 16:41.868
You flatter her to even
dwell on her name.

16:41.870 --> 16:46.070
He cares for her. I saw it.

16:50.950 --> 16:55.990
Isabel? Isabel? Izzy?

16:57.710 --> 16:59.348
'My dear Jasper.

16:59.350 --> 17:01.788
'I write to tell you that
my husband, Sir Henry Stafford,

17:01.790 --> 17:02.870
'died of his wounds...

17:04.270 --> 17:06.788
'..and my mother, Lady Beauchamp,
is also gone.

17:06.790 --> 17:10.950
'I am now a widow, and there is
no-one to guide or force my hand.

17:13.030 --> 17:13.950
'Shall I come to you?'

17:23.869 --> 17:25.748
I want to see Mother.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.310
Don't be ridiculous, Anne.

17:28.630 --> 17:29.748
Tell her, George.

17:29.750 --> 17:31.748
I'm going this afternoon.
I just need a horse.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.230
Not today, Anne. No horse today.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.630
My Lady.

17:58.230 --> 18:01.068
'Daughter, I greet you well. You
have been at court for many months

18:01.070 --> 18:03.548
'but I have received no reply or
acknowledgement from you.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.188
'I am, as you know, in sanctuary to
protect me from our enemies.

18:06.190 --> 18:08.548
'Use your influence to
restore my freedom and fortune.

18:08.550 --> 18:09.590
'Your Lady Mother.'

18:19.910 --> 18:21.110
Husband.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.270
I will have to keep Anne by my side.

18:30.670 --> 18:32.308
She grows ruder by the day.

18:32.310 --> 18:34.390
Anne is not coming to the
festivities.

18:37.470 --> 18:38.470
Not at all?

18:39.750 --> 18:42.668
Anne is not going anywhere,

18:42.670 --> 18:46.710
nor doing anything
without my permission.

18:48.950 --> 18:52.028
Well, I don't mind if she comes.
It's just that I don't...

18:52.030 --> 18:53.150
Leave it!

18:54.190 --> 18:56.388
Anne is still upset, Isabel.

18:56.390 --> 19:00.268
I do not want her making public
accusations about being imprisoned

19:00.270 --> 19:02.830
or railing against matters which
have already been agreed.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.390
We cannot be disgraced in front
of every noble family in England.

19:10.870 --> 19:13.550
No. No, of course not.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.030
She will stay in her room.

19:23.150 --> 19:25.668
Can she attend chapel?

19:25.670 --> 19:29.670
Of course.
A trip to chapel might humble her.

19:44.110 --> 19:45.150
Anne.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.590
You said you were taking me
to safety.

19:52.190 --> 19:53.508
Let go of me!

19:53.510 --> 19:55.228
If you're happy living
with your sister

19:55.230 --> 19:57.668
and being a prisoner here,
then I'll not say another word.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.270
I'm not. Of course I'm not.

20:01.670 --> 20:05.590
Come to the yew garden after dinner.
I'll be waiting.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.710
Merry Christmas, Mother.

20:15.350 --> 20:17.390
The children will be
arriving shortly.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.630
Mother?

20:23.910 --> 20:28.550
Oh. Forgive me.
I didn't hear you come in.

20:30.470 --> 20:31.390
No, thank you.

20:32.670 --> 20:33.788
Are you ill?

20:33.790 --> 20:35.470
No, no. I just haven't slept.

20:41.150 --> 20:45.230
In truth, I think I'd prefer to
rest than dance.

20:46.230 --> 20:48.630
And miss the Christmas
celebrations, huh?

20:51.630 --> 20:54.308
A year's worth of Court
gossip at a single sitting?

20:54.310 --> 20:55.390
You must be ill.

20:57.550 --> 20:59.428
I'll call the physician.

20:59.430 --> 21:00.310
No.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.110
I don't need a physician.

21:05.790 --> 21:09.308
There's nothing
for a physician to see

21:09.310 --> 21:11.988
and, thank God, nothing that
some fool with a knife

21:11.990 --> 21:13.310
could think to cut out.

21:15.790 --> 21:16.870
Then what is wrong?

21:21.350 --> 21:24.910
My heart. It's beating strangely.

21:26.150 --> 21:28.870
I feel it skip a beat
and then go slow.

21:33.550 --> 21:35.870
It won't beat strongly again,
Elizabeth.

21:40.470 --> 21:41.630
What are you saying?

21:44.830 --> 21:49.510
Prepare yourself.
I won't be with you much longer.

22:06.030 --> 22:09.750
His Grace, King Edward,
and Queen Elizabeth.

22:14.510 --> 22:15.550
Brother.

23:45.790 --> 23:46.750
Anne.

23:50.110 --> 23:52.428
Forgive me.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.148
When I brought you to
Isabel, I thought

23:54.150 --> 23:56.108
I was bringing you to
a place of safety.

23:56.110 --> 23:58.988
On my word, I had no idea
what would result.

23:58.990 --> 24:01.988
George holds me captive here
and you knew nothing of it?

24:01.990 --> 24:02.988
I did not.

24:02.990 --> 24:06.548
For six months, no-one, save my
sister and her ever-present

24:06.550 --> 24:10.990
flock of ladies, has seen me
from one day, one week, to the next.

24:12.830 --> 24:15.468
Didn't you wonder where I was?

24:15.470 --> 24:16.870
I did more than wonder.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.788
I asked after you, often, but was
always supplied with some excuse.

24:21.790 --> 24:23.748
A cold. A chill.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.388
Oh, truly.

24:25.390 --> 24:28.108
Until I demanded to see you
and George said that I could not.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.110
Oh? And what was I ailing with?

24:31.510 --> 24:32.748
Grief.

24:32.750 --> 24:35.428
George told me you were too
deep in mourning for your husband

24:35.430 --> 24:36.550
to be in mixed company.

24:38.470 --> 24:40.908
This confirmed what
I already suspected,

24:40.910 --> 24:43.948
that he has been holding you here,
keeping you out of sight.

24:43.950 --> 24:49.308
They will keep me here until my
mother dies and then George,

24:49.310 --> 24:54.788
my loving guardian, George, will
inherit the entire Warwick fortune.

24:54.790 --> 24:57.028
Providing he can keep me
locked up and unmarried,

24:57.030 --> 24:58.430
everything will go to him.

25:00.270 --> 25:01.508
Oh, George.

25:01.510 --> 25:03.988
It is not only your avaricious
brother.

25:03.990 --> 25:06.790
It is my sister, colluding with him.

25:08.190 --> 25:13.228
She is my gaoler, dispatching her
ladies to watch over me like hawks.

25:13.230 --> 25:16.628
They will hold me here
until they have broken my spirit

25:16.630 --> 25:18.990
and I submit to my fate
without complaint.

25:21.430 --> 25:23.468
Listen to me, Anne.

25:23.470 --> 25:26.988
You must buy yourself more
freedom by going along with George,

25:26.990 --> 25:29.190
by pretending to
go along with George.

25:30.190 --> 25:31.668
Flattery always works.

25:31.670 --> 25:35.348
He responds to nothing more
sophisticated than flattery.

25:35.350 --> 25:36.388
Isabel, too.

25:36.390 --> 25:39.110
That will at least gain you some
freedom for now...

25:40.350 --> 25:44.148
till the time is right for me
to approach the King and ask him

25:44.150 --> 25:46.350
to release George's
guardianship over you.

25:49.430 --> 25:51.670
You will approach
the King on my behalf?

25:53.510 --> 25:56.990
Yes, if you would like me to.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.630
Why would you do that?

26:02.630 --> 26:03.630
Why do you think?

26:15.150 --> 26:16.550
You cannot leave me now.

26:18.830 --> 26:20.108
Are you in any pain?

26:20.110 --> 26:24.310
No. There's no pain for me
except in knowing yours.

26:27.790 --> 26:31.388
What do you see? Tell me.
Please, Mother.

26:31.390 --> 26:35.188
I must know. What is our future?
What is...

26:35.190 --> 26:36.830
What is mine and Edward's future?

26:39.910 --> 26:42.070
You will have another boy.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.230
Of that I am sure.

26:46.590 --> 26:49.348
And what a boy he will be!

26:49.350 --> 26:50.748
I'm sure of that, too.

26:50.750 --> 26:55.630
Then get well and stay with me.
See... See him born!

26:59.750 --> 27:03.988
You've been with me
through everything. Everything.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.550
I would not be here without you.

27:08.110 --> 27:09.990
None of us would be
here without you.

27:11.550 --> 27:13.630
And yet, here you are.

27:16.110 --> 27:21.470
And through you and your children,
I will have founded a line of kings.

27:24.510 --> 27:25.830
And queens, too, I think.

27:33.710 --> 27:34.710
I'm not ready.

27:36.990 --> 27:38.190
No-one is ever ready.

27:51.150 --> 27:52.470
'My dear Lady Margaret...

27:53.630 --> 27:56.628
'I'm sorry for your losses
and hope to comfort you with

27:56.630 --> 27:59.750
'the knowledge that your son is safe
and grows up strong.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.828
'There is no need to come to us.

28:03.830 --> 28:06.390
'Your path to help
Henry must be in England.

28:07.630 --> 28:11.750
'These are dark times for Lancaster
but we must remain steadfast.

28:12.870 --> 28:15.548
'Entertain no doubts, Margaret.

28:15.550 --> 28:18.670
'Only redouble your efforts
on behalf of our Tudor King.

28:20.110 --> 28:22.830
'Your servant, Jasper.'

28:48.190 --> 28:49.188
Sir Reginald.

28:49.190 --> 28:50.908
My... My Lady...

28:50.910 --> 28:52.830
I have decided to marry into York.

28:55.750 --> 28:59.590
I want you to go to Court and make
delicate enquiries on my behalf.

29:00.910 --> 29:02.030
Certainly, My Lady.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.548
With whom?

29:04.550 --> 29:07.908
I will entertain only the very
closest of the King's confidantes.

29:07.910 --> 29:10.910
Only a man right at the heart of the
York Court is of any value to me.

29:15.110 --> 29:19.628
May I ask who, among the King's men,
you have in mind?

29:19.630 --> 29:21.508
His brother.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.188
George of Clarence?

29:23.190 --> 29:24.628
No, you fool. Richard.

29:24.630 --> 29:25.750
He is not betrothed.

29:26.870 --> 29:28.830
I do not think
I am looking too high.

29:37.070 --> 29:38.068
Sir Reginald?

29:38.070 --> 29:39.110
Yes, My Lady?

29:40.550 --> 29:44.310
What else might be mentioned
in the hope of a favourable outcome?

29:45.470 --> 29:48.030
Do... do... do...
Do you sing, My Lady?

29:49.070 --> 29:50.710
No, I do not sing.

29:52.790 --> 29:58.310
You may tell him I have had saints'
knees since childhood.

30:10.670 --> 30:13.628
Izzy, you were right about Mother.

30:13.630 --> 30:15.470
There was no need for me
to rush to her side.

30:19.710 --> 30:21.390
I am getting used to it here.

30:23.670 --> 30:25.150
It was hard at first but...

30:26.910 --> 30:28.190
It looks lovely on you.

30:31.390 --> 30:33.190
You have the perfect
complexion for it.

30:37.350 --> 30:41.708
Well, if you can behave like this,
Anne, then there's no

30:41.710 --> 30:44.630
need for you to spend quite
so much time in your room.

31:03.110 --> 31:05.230
Perfect. You're a killer!

31:21.710 --> 31:25.428
You are leading the hunt, I believe?

31:25.430 --> 31:27.228
I can barely walk.

31:27.230 --> 31:30.948
Has the King relented over
sending baby to Wales?

31:30.950 --> 31:32.668
No. He has not and he will not.

31:32.670 --> 31:34.468
Well, he knows how you
feel about George.

31:34.470 --> 31:38.468
He wouldn't defy you
and appoint him. As for Richard...

31:38.470 --> 31:40.988
I want you to take my son, Anthony.

31:40.990 --> 31:42.708
You are the only one
I can trust with him.

31:42.710 --> 31:43.868
They will never accept it.

31:43.870 --> 31:45.828
I do not care what they will accept.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.908
Will you do it?

31:47.910 --> 31:51.268
Of course. Of course I will.

31:51.270 --> 31:54.148
I will guard him with my life.

31:54.150 --> 31:56.670
Oh, well,
let's hope it doesn't come to that.

32:15.230 --> 32:16.348
There.

32:16.350 --> 32:17.630
Go on. Go on.

32:21.790 --> 32:25.308
Your Grace, Lady Beaufort is a most
devoted mother to the last

32:25.310 --> 32:26.548
Lancastrian heir.

32:26.550 --> 32:29.830
All Lady Beaufort seeks, Your Grace,
is a peaceful England.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.548
You escaped.

32:51.550 --> 32:54.110
If this is escape,
I cannot imagine captivity.

32:55.710 --> 32:58.748
Did you enjoy the hunt?
Only, I couldn't see.

32:58.750 --> 33:00.188
You were right at the back.

33:00.190 --> 33:04.828
Ah, yes. Well, there were interesting
matters to attend to

33:04.830 --> 33:06.348
at the back.

33:06.350 --> 33:07.670
A proposal to discuss.

33:09.510 --> 33:11.188
What proposal?

33:11.190 --> 33:16.628
A marriage proposal.
From Margaret Beaufort.

33:16.630 --> 33:19.710
Margaret Beaufort? She's ancient!

33:20.910 --> 33:22.950
Ancient and ugly and fanatical!

33:25.030 --> 33:26.508
Perhaps she is

33:26.510 --> 33:29.110
but she is also one
of the wealthiest women in England.

33:30.790 --> 33:33.628
Well, if that is your motive
for marriage, then perhaps you're

33:33.630 --> 33:35.150
not so different from your brother.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.750
Anne.

33:38.790 --> 33:39.828
Anne.

33:39.830 --> 33:43.988
If I were not a prisoner here,
my fortune stolen from me,

33:43.990 --> 33:46.470
I, too, could marry any
man of my choice.

33:50.710 --> 33:52.990
I suppose you have yet to
approach the King?

33:54.230 --> 33:58.828
I told you I would do it when the
time was right. That has not changed.

33:58.830 --> 33:59.868
You can count on me, Anne.

33:59.870 --> 34:05.068
No. It's all right.
Attend to your marriage prospects.

34:05.070 --> 34:07.148
I don't need your help.

34:07.150 --> 34:09.230
I have learnt to rely
only on myself.

34:22.350 --> 34:25.788
Brother. May I speak with you?

34:25.790 --> 34:26.670
Of course you may.

34:30.350 --> 34:34.428
I should like to know, if I wished
to marry, how I would go about it.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.628
Your year of mourning is not
yet at an end, Anne.

34:36.630 --> 34:40.547
It is a little unseemly to be
discussing remarriage until it is.

34:40.550 --> 34:43.507
I'm sure I do not intend any
disrespect, brother,

34:43.510 --> 34:46.228
merely clarification on what
exactly is my position.

34:46.230 --> 34:47.628
Your "position"?

34:47.630 --> 34:50.868
This question of marriage seems to
give you much concern.

34:50.870 --> 34:52.748
It really appears to have
you quite upset.

34:52.750 --> 34:54.467
Anne, what are you doing?
What is she doing?

34:54.469 --> 34:58.748
If you prefer it, I'd be happy to
arrange for your place in an abbey.

34:58.750 --> 35:02.908
Yes. Now I see that that might
suit you quite well.

35:02.910 --> 35:04.830
Yes, far better than
remaining here with us.

35:08.990 --> 35:10.708
You would let him do this?

35:10.710 --> 35:12.710
You would let him send me
to an abbey?

35:15.670 --> 35:17.268
Go to your room, Anne.

35:17.270 --> 35:19.148
Isabel, please.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.868
Can't you see what he's doing?

35:20.870 --> 35:23.428
He is going to lock me
up like he locked up our mother.

35:23.430 --> 35:24.990
You will never see me again.

35:28.510 --> 35:30.470
Isabel! Isabel!

35:37.190 --> 35:39.308
Richard was not suitable anyway.

35:39.310 --> 35:42.670
He's as loyal as a hog,
as loyal as a dog.

35:49.110 --> 35:53.428
There... there is
another possibility, My Lady.

35:53.430 --> 35:55.148
Who?

35:55.150 --> 35:58.628
A man, not of the King's kin,
but as close to him

35:58.630 --> 36:00.190
as it is possible to be.

36:02.150 --> 36:03.150
Lord Stanley.

36:04.430 --> 36:06.308
That turncoat.

36:06.310 --> 36:08.108
Born faithful to the
House of Lancaster,

36:08.110 --> 36:10.828
yet switches his allegiance to York
after the Battle of Towton.

36:10.830 --> 36:12.590
What would I want with
a traitor like that?

36:13.990 --> 36:17.590
My Lady, it is less treachery
than strategy.

36:19.710 --> 36:23.348
At every battle, Stanley
and his brother divide

36:23.350 --> 36:27.348
and join opposing sides,
ensuring that there is always one

36:27.350 --> 36:30.150
Stanley who wears
the winning colours.

36:37.430 --> 36:38.470
Arrange a meeting.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.470
My Lady, there is
more news from Court.

36:48.750 --> 36:51.348
Jacquetta, the Queen's mother.

36:51.350 --> 36:52.430
What about her?

36:53.790 --> 36:57.630
When I left, she was not expected
to last a week.

37:00.990 --> 37:02.310
Impossible.

37:05.030 --> 37:08.628
Surely, among her armoury of spells
and curses, there must be some

37:08.630 --> 37:12.428
amulet or other ensuring her
continued presence on this earth.

37:12.430 --> 37:13.590
It seems not.

37:24.110 --> 37:25.150
Mm.

37:29.190 --> 37:30.830
A Rivers King.

37:37.350 --> 37:39.070
I must rest. I'm sorry.

37:40.710 --> 37:44.670
Don't apologise.
I will stay with you.

37:45.910 --> 37:49.788
No, no, no.
Anthony can stay with me.

37:49.790 --> 37:53.988
I want you to spend your last
night before your confinement

37:53.990 --> 37:55.070
with your husband.

38:09.670 --> 38:12.110
What are your intentions
for Anne Neville?

38:14.910 --> 38:17.190
Why? What are yours?

38:19.750 --> 38:21.230
What do you think they are?

38:24.230 --> 38:26.030
Well, you're not attracted to her...

38:27.630 --> 38:31.188
which can only leave a motive no
more honourable than mine.

38:31.190 --> 38:34.510
You might fool Edward, little
brother, but you can't fool me.

38:35.790 --> 38:38.550
Stay away from Anne Neville.

38:41.470 --> 38:43.548
Of greater concern is
the Queen appointing

38:43.550 --> 38:45.908
Anthony Rivers as the guardian
of Prince Edward.

38:45.910 --> 38:46.950
When?

38:52.910 --> 38:55.990
Your Grace, what a coincidence.

38:59.150 --> 39:01.748
We were just discussing your poor,
dear mother,

39:01.750 --> 39:05.908
hoping very much that rumours of her
dreadful state have been

39:05.910 --> 39:07.110
exaggerated.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.750
Can I help you with anything,
Your Grace?

39:16.670 --> 39:20.950
No. Thank you. Goodnight.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.110
Were you looking for your husband?

39:28.030 --> 39:30.270
I believe he's with
Jane Shore tonight.

40:00.590 --> 40:03.870
Please. Just... just wait a moment.

40:05.110 --> 40:08.148
It is for Richard,
the Duke of Gloucester.

40:08.150 --> 40:10.550
He is my friend since childhood.

40:13.990 --> 40:15.068
Take this.

40:15.070 --> 40:18.470
But the Duke of Clarence...
You need to get it to him tonight.

42:05.910 --> 42:07.628
Anne. Richard.

42:07.630 --> 42:10.348
George is going to put me
in a nunnery.

42:10.350 --> 42:11.348
Of course he is.

42:11.350 --> 42:13.948
Perhaps I should not have
confronted him. I played my hand

42:13.950 --> 42:18.228
and I should not have. Now his mind
is made up and it is hopeless.

42:18.230 --> 42:22.148
No. It's not. It's not hopeless.

42:22.150 --> 42:23.390
But you cannot go back there.

42:24.790 --> 42:28.508
George will not hesitate to do what
he has threatened.

42:28.510 --> 42:33.068
Anne, running away may be the only
way through this,

42:33.070 --> 42:35.468
seeking sanctuary.
Then I'll go. I'm ready to go.

42:35.470 --> 42:39.190
Anne... Anne. You must be sure.

42:41.710 --> 42:45.790
I am sure. I'm not the little girl
you knew, Richard.

42:46.990 --> 42:48.988
I've grown up.

42:48.990 --> 42:52.228
Margaret of Anjou taught me
not to hesitate.

42:52.230 --> 42:55.628
She told me there would be times
when I have to see the best

42:55.630 --> 42:59.230
thing for myself
and take that course without fear.

43:03.470 --> 43:04.470
Anne?

43:05.590 --> 43:06.590
What is it?

43:10.790 --> 43:11.790
Will you marry me?

43:19.550 --> 43:20.950
You will get my fortune.

43:23.470 --> 43:26.670
If I marry you,
everything I have becomes yours.

43:29.270 --> 43:31.188
It's true.

43:31.190 --> 43:37.348
Marrying you would make me a wealthy
man, just as you marrying me

43:37.350 --> 43:41.190
will make you a royal duchess
and equal to your sister.

43:43.590 --> 43:46.150
But I will be a true husband
because I love you.

43:49.430 --> 43:52.550
You love me, Richard? Truly?

43:55.430 --> 43:59.990
I do. Perhaps I always have.

44:15.550 --> 44:19.550
Anne, will you marry me?

44:23.630 --> 44:24.630
Yes.

44:42.710 --> 44:43.750
Annie.

44:58.630 --> 44:59.710
Anne?

45:09.150 --> 45:12.670
My Lady, Lord Thomas Stanley.

45:24.630 --> 45:25.590
Lady Beaufort.

45:34.630 --> 45:36.470
I hope I will please you as a wife.

45:43.310 --> 45:46.508
I thought it was an arrangement that
would suit us equally.

45:46.510 --> 45:48.350
It was clever of you to think of it.

45:50.790 --> 45:53.268
I believe my advisor made it
clear to you that

45:53.270 --> 45:55.788
I wish for a position at Court?

45:55.790 --> 45:57.110
Indeed, he made that plain.

45:58.390 --> 46:00.388
And did he also convey my desire...

46:00.390 --> 46:05.148
my intention that there be no
issue from our marriage?

46:05.150 --> 46:07.828
Fear not. Your spiritual gifts
were lavishly detailed.

46:07.830 --> 46:08.870
I am well briefed.

46:09.870 --> 46:11.270
You wish to live as a nun.

46:12.630 --> 46:14.988
I hope that is agreeable to you?

46:14.990 --> 46:17.508
Perfectly. I have sons already.

46:17.510 --> 46:19.788
No need to try for another with you.

46:19.790 --> 46:21.990
Tell me, how old is your boy now?

46:23.830 --> 46:24.910
He's 15.

46:26.230 --> 46:30.708
That your son has a legitimate claim
to the throne is beyond dispute.

46:30.710 --> 46:32.750
Little wonder Edward prefers him
where he is.

46:34.630 --> 46:38.708
It is only with the King's favour
that I can bring my son home.

46:38.710 --> 46:40.110
It cannot be rushed.

46:41.710 --> 46:44.588
I will judge what
I can do for your son

46:44.590 --> 46:47.190
and, in due course, what
rewards your son can offer me.

46:49.230 --> 46:50.670
As for Jasper Tudor...

46:52.510 --> 46:54.468
Edward will never
reconcile with him.

46:54.470 --> 46:56.150
Henry will have to leave him behind.

46:58.270 --> 47:01.348
I believe I made it clear
to your advisors that you will have

47:01.350 --> 47:07.990
to serve the House of York,
King Edward and Queen Elizabeth?

47:11.870 --> 47:15.828
You will be required to take up
a place in the Queen's chamber

47:15.830 --> 47:18.148
and, to all appearances, be a loyal

47:18.150 --> 47:21.228
and faithful
member of the House of York.

47:21.230 --> 47:25.148
There can be no shadow of doubt or
anxiety in their minds,

47:25.150 --> 47:26.990
from the first day until the last.

47:30.270 --> 47:33.068
Will they accept me at Court?

47:33.070 --> 47:35.070
They're eager to heal
the wounds of the past.

47:37.870 --> 47:42.350
Then I will be patient and endeavour
to rise in their favour.

47:50.070 --> 47:51.428
My own brother!

47:51.430 --> 47:54.428
She's run off with him
and I've been betrayed by my own.

47:54.430 --> 47:57.430
It's a betrayal.
A sly and wanton betrayal.

47:58.870 --> 48:01.748
He has no right, no right whatever
to take up with her.

48:01.750 --> 48:05.508
I am her guardian, and if he wants
to marry that... that girl,

48:05.510 --> 48:07.788
then he should have
sought my permission. And what is

48:07.790 --> 48:10.588
a greater transgression is that he
should have sought yours, too.

48:10.590 --> 48:12.588
What is it? Why are you laughing?
What's funny?

48:12.590 --> 48:13.868
Because I cannot resist.

48:13.870 --> 48:17.028
I do not remember you asking
my permission

48:17.030 --> 48:20.950
before you married Isabel.
That is not the same.

48:22.790 --> 48:24.588
Your Grace.

48:24.590 --> 48:26.630
I seek your blessing to marry
Lady Anne Neville.

48:29.870 --> 48:32.228
Did you tell her that you loved her?

48:32.230 --> 48:33.668
Was it as simple as that?

48:33.670 --> 48:36.510
Edward is the King. It is
his choice, not mine.

48:37.510 --> 48:38.588
Not now.

48:38.590 --> 48:40.788
Your Grace,
the Queen's baby is coming early.

48:40.790 --> 48:42.508
The midwife says
she may not survive it.

48:42.510 --> 48:44.228
You would go and leave this
unresolved?

48:44.230 --> 48:46.750
Settle this pettiness
between yourselves.

49:02.590 --> 49:03.590
Stand aside!

49:34.230 --> 49:35.270
One more time.

49:39.950 --> 49:40.950
Come on, breathe.

49:42.790 --> 49:43.790
He's come too early.

49:49.630 --> 49:50.910
His breathing is weak.

50:14.070 --> 50:15.150
He's dying, Mother.

50:28.790 --> 50:30.110
Take care of him for me.

50:59.190 --> 51:00.230
No...

52:39.070 --> 52:40.228
Good evening.

52:40.230 --> 52:41.230
Good evening.

52:47.430 --> 52:49.430
Now would be the moment, yes?

52:51.550 --> 52:54.068
Were it not for your express
stipulation that such

52:54.070 --> 52:56.190
a thing should be
avoided at all costs.

52:59.230 --> 53:00.868
Fear not, Margaret.

53:00.870 --> 53:03.948
I am more than happy
to respect your wishes.

53:03.950 --> 53:04.950
Goodnight.

53:39.190 --> 53:42.750
I worried George would intercept
my note, stop you from coming.

53:44.630 --> 53:49.628
All financial matters have been
resolved between he and Richard,

53:49.630 --> 53:51.670
so I doubt he'll mind what I do now.

53:59.630 --> 54:01.348
I'm sorry.

54:01.350 --> 54:02.390
It is in the past.

54:05.230 --> 54:08.830
I wrote to Mother
to tell her about my marriage.

54:10.830 --> 54:12.788
She sent back a curse.

54:12.790 --> 54:17.228
Anne, you don't need her blessing

54:17.230 --> 54:20.228
and you cannot be
harmed by her curse.

54:20.230 --> 54:25.070
You have a husband that loves you
and you have me.

54:28.310 --> 54:30.270
And I will never let you down again.

54:34.910 --> 54:36.190
Will you come and visit me?

54:38.150 --> 54:40.310
We are going to
live at Warwick Castle.

54:41.870 --> 54:42.950
You're going home.

54:44.710 --> 54:45.910
Of course I'll come.

54:47.790 --> 54:50.510
Don't cry, Anne. Don't cry.

54:51.630 --> 54:53.190
Oh, Izzy. I have missed you.

55:02.790 --> 55:05.790
It's a comfort to know that they
are both with God now.

55:09.790 --> 55:14.390
There was a moment when I thought
you were gone from me, too.

55:16.190 --> 55:17.270
Only one moment?

55:19.590 --> 55:21.508
Then you're lucky.

55:21.510 --> 55:24.350
When you broke sanctuary,
I stood by your side.

55:26.190 --> 55:31.430
When I saw you smother an old man
in his sleep, I stood by you again.

55:34.390 --> 55:35.590
I never doubted you...

55:39.070 --> 55:41.470
until I came into your room
that night.

55:45.230 --> 55:50.428
This?
This is what has been burdening you?

55:50.430 --> 55:51.590
"This"?

55:53.510 --> 55:55.910
You lay with her like you loved her.

55:57.870 --> 56:01.150
Like she could
so easily take my place.

56:05.630 --> 56:09.348
Neither she nor any other woman
could ever take your place.

56:09.350 --> 56:10.870
Well, she did take it.

56:14.150 --> 56:19.990
The night before my confinement,
you were with her and not me.

56:21.310 --> 56:23.508
Elizabeth, you knew
when you married me

56:23.510 --> 56:27.430
that I would not be a husband that
would faithfully sit at your feet.

56:31.990 --> 56:33.390
We are not young any more.

56:35.430 --> 56:39.348
We are not those two people who
met on the side of the road.

56:39.350 --> 56:40.390
They are gone.

56:42.110 --> 56:43.150
Then what remains?

56:47.230 --> 56:49.390
What remains is my love for you.

56:53.950 --> 56:56.830
You are what sustains me in battle.

56:58.790 --> 57:00.750
You are my home.

57:15.350 --> 57:16.508
Sweet.

57:16.510 --> 57:19.110
The Prince of Wales will make
a fine horseman.

58:17.430 --> 58:18.430
Your Grace.
