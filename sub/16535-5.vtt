WEBVTT

00:02.562 --> 00:03.890
Hey. Thanks for swinging by.

00:03.914 --> 00:05.682
Ye-no sweat. We were doing
a prep at 26th and Cal.

00:05.749 --> 00:06.683
What's going on?

00:06.750 --> 00:07.784
There's been a rash of ODs.

00:07.818 --> 00:08.785
They're coming in in waves.

00:08.818 --> 00:10.353
Third one today just coded.

00:10.421 --> 00:12.522
- Heroin?
- Yeah, but definitely laced.

00:12.590 --> 00:13.990
Probably fentanyl.

00:14.024 --> 00:16.492
I haven't seen anything
like this since...

00:16.527 --> 00:17.627
ever.

00:17.661 --> 00:18.628
I'll put a call in to Narcotics...

00:18.662 --> 00:19.796
see what they know.

00:19.830 --> 00:20.997
Can we get the CFD paperwork?

00:21.031 --> 00:22.332
I want to see where
these paramedic calls

00:22.366 --> 00:23.499
are originating from.

00:23.534 --> 00:25.468
They're coming in from
all over the city.

00:25.502 --> 00:27.470
I've got another one.
Narcan's wearing off.

00:27.504 --> 00:30.340
Give him another 2 of Narcan...
slow IV push.

00:31.942 --> 00:33.309
All right, I'll pull together
a detailed list when I can.

00:33.344 --> 00:34.377
- I got to go.
- Thanks, man,

00:34.445 --> 00:35.645
Thanks.

00:37.815 --> 00:40.116
Man.

00:40.150 --> 00:41.985
We got to roll.

00:46.523 --> 00:47.490
What do we got?

00:47.524 --> 00:48.958
A call came in.

00:48.993 --> 00:51.494
Suspicious package by the lake.

00:51.528 --> 00:53.997
Family was setting up for
their kid's birthday party.

00:54.031 --> 00:56.899
Roger and Ashley Basinski over here.

00:56.967 --> 00:58.635
The mother found a backpack

00:58.669 --> 01:00.403
soaked in what she believed to be blood.

01:00.471 --> 01:01.638
Recovered right over here.

01:01.672 --> 01:03.339
She open it?

01:03.374 --> 01:05.541
Yeah, found a surprise inside.

01:05.576 --> 01:07.143
- You want to talk to 'em?
- Yeah.

01:07.177 --> 01:08.311
All right.

01:08.345 --> 01:10.647
All right, guys...

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:23.894 --> 01:24.927
Fentanyl?

01:26.163 --> 01:27.597
300 K worth.

01:27.665 --> 01:29.732
My guy in Narcotics says
recently they've been

01:29.767 --> 01:31.601
pulling heroin off the streets
that's been cut with it.

01:31.669 --> 01:33.569
Makes it, like, 1,000 times more potent.

01:33.604 --> 01:35.905
It's killing people all over Chicago.

01:39.743 --> 01:41.511
Hey, Sarge.

01:41.545 --> 01:45.014
I heard Mouse came looking
to get a felony dropped

01:45.049 --> 01:48.017
so he could re-enlist.

01:48.052 --> 01:49.585
And if he did?

01:49.620 --> 01:52.121
I think he's carrying
around a lot of guilt

01:52.189 --> 01:54.691
that we made it home safe

01:54.725 --> 01:57.460
and friends of ours didn't.

02:05.736 --> 02:07.203
Grab a shoulder. Grab a shoulder.

02:07.237 --> 02:08.738
Are you all right?

02:08.771 --> 02:11.107
Get her out of here; get
her to her parents.

02:13.777 --> 02:15.812
Be careful.

02:18.449 --> 02:20.583
Man.

02:20.617 --> 02:22.752
God.

02:22.786 --> 02:24.220
My God.

02:41.739 --> 02:44.050
Back in '06, we had freezer trucks

02:44.075 --> 02:45.409
parked out back filled with stiffs

02:45.443 --> 02:47.714
from all the heat-related deaths.

02:47.739 --> 02:49.740
We actually ran out of toe tags.

02:49.775 --> 02:51.175
All of these are from fentanyl?

02:51.210 --> 02:54.045
Last two weeks have been insane.

02:54.079 --> 02:55.746
Dealers get the cut wrong,

02:55.781 --> 02:57.782
your heart stops instantly.

02:57.850 --> 02:59.884
Okay.

02:59.918 --> 03:03.621
Cause of death on your DOA
is blunt head trauma.

03:03.689 --> 03:06.757
Abrasions on both shoulders

03:06.792 --> 03:09.694
match the width of the backpack
recovered at the scene.

03:09.728 --> 03:10.928
You find any drugs in his system?

03:10.963 --> 03:13.030
Toxicology report came back clean.

03:13.065 --> 03:15.032
But you may be able to run with this.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.468
His skin was bloated from
the time in the water...

03:17.536 --> 03:19.570
ballparking at seven hours.

03:19.605 --> 03:21.706
Clear as day now that he's dried out.

03:27.145 --> 03:28.479
So how's the online dating going?

03:28.547 --> 03:29.747
My God, shush.

03:29.781 --> 03:30.982
Okay, sorry.

03:31.049 --> 03:32.550
Can I talk to you guys?

03:32.584 --> 03:33.618
God, is that her...

03:33.652 --> 03:34.952
Yeah, it's her bad news voice.

03:39.758 --> 03:43.494
Julie, there's no easy way to say this.

03:43.562 --> 03:45.596
You're being transferred
back to your foot beat

03:45.631 --> 03:46.931
at 26th and Cal.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.766
What the hell? She just got here.

03:51.236 --> 03:53.104
It's Fogel.

03:53.138 --> 03:55.606
Because she didn't consent
to being his piece of ass?

03:55.641 --> 03:56.774
I am well aware of the particulars...

03:56.808 --> 03:58.609
- I mean, you got to be...
- Burgess!

04:02.514 --> 04:05.516
I brought you in at
management discretion.

04:05.584 --> 04:06.764
He went over me.

04:06.866 --> 04:08.700
He went over the union.

04:08.734 --> 04:10.435
He is a commander,

04:10.503 --> 04:13.872
and there is nothing more I can do.

04:13.906 --> 04:15.440
I'm sorry.

04:15.508 --> 04:17.608
This is your last shift at 21.

04:26.452 --> 04:28.453
We'll fight it.

04:37.263 --> 04:39.397
Hey, anything come back on the tattoo?

04:39.432 --> 04:41.633
Yeah, I went through the intake
records at the morgue...

04:41.701 --> 04:45.403
checked every death certificate
from April 22, 2010...

04:45.438 --> 04:46.404
by hand.

04:46.439 --> 04:47.405
They're not online.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.573
So that's a no then?

04:48.607 --> 04:50.742
No.

04:50.776 --> 04:52.644
It's Grace Clarendon.

04:52.712 --> 04:54.746
leukemia.

04:54.780 --> 04:55.947
She was 14.

04:57.883 --> 04:59.150
Damn.

04:59.218 --> 05:01.753
LKA for her mother is at
the bottom of the page,

05:01.787 --> 05:03.888
right hand side.

05:03.923 --> 05:05.790
You're welcome.

05:18.304 --> 05:19.504
Theresa Clarendon?

05:19.572 --> 05:20.605
- Yeah.
- I'm Detective Dawson.

05:20.639 --> 05:21.906
This is Detective Olinsky.

05:21.941 --> 05:23.174
No, I asked Mr. Harrison

05:23.242 --> 05:24.743
to give me another week
to put the rent together.

05:24.777 --> 05:26.010
Please don't throw me out.

05:26.078 --> 05:29.781
We're...we're
here about your son.

05:29.815 --> 05:33.017
Why? What happened to him?

05:33.085 --> 05:34.786
Ma'am, I'm gonna show you a photo.

05:40.493 --> 05:42.327
That's his tattoo.

05:45.998 --> 05:48.366
God, is he okay?

05:48.434 --> 05:49.968
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

06:01.714 --> 06:05.350
When we placed Grace to rest,

06:05.384 --> 06:08.653
I just assumed

06:08.687 --> 06:10.388
Tyler would be the one

06:10.456 --> 06:12.490
to lay me next to her.

06:14.126 --> 06:15.794
Ms. Clarendon,

06:15.828 --> 06:18.830
is there any chance that
your son might have been

06:18.864 --> 06:20.698
mixed up in something illegal?

06:20.733 --> 06:22.734
Like what?

06:22.802 --> 06:25.403
When Tyler was found, he
was wearing a backpack

06:25.471 --> 06:26.871
filled with narcotics.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.676
Tyler had a problem with that

06:31.710 --> 06:33.845
when he got back from overseas.

06:33.879 --> 06:35.880
He was in the military.

06:35.915 --> 06:38.383
He was trying to get his life together.

06:38.417 --> 06:39.851
He got a job.

06:39.885 --> 06:41.419
Doing what?

06:41.487 --> 06:43.822
Landscaping, he said.

06:43.856 --> 06:44.856
I don't know the details.

06:44.890 --> 06:46.825
I saw him mostly on Facebook.

06:46.859 --> 06:48.726
He have any recent posts?

07:08.047 --> 07:10.682
This friend... you know him?

07:12.184 --> 07:13.751
<i>Tyler Clarendon.</i>

07:16.188 --> 07:18.857
This woman outlived both her kids.

07:18.891 --> 07:21.593
His new best friend was Tony Chin.

07:21.627 --> 07:22.727
20.

07:22.761 --> 07:24.028
Junior at Central Chicago U.

07:24.063 --> 07:25.897
No criminal record, but
the last few weeks,

07:25.931 --> 07:28.600
he suddenly appears all over
Tyler's social media profile.

07:28.634 --> 07:30.201
Mouse, you dump his phone records?

07:30.236 --> 07:32.804
Yeah, there's dozens of calls
between Tyler and Tony Chin,

07:32.872 --> 07:34.138
all less than two minutes in duration

07:34.206 --> 07:35.740
and at all sorts of crazy hours.

07:35.774 --> 07:38.042
Have Atwater and Ruzek
take a run at this guy.

07:38.077 --> 07:40.945
You know, Tyler...

07:40.980 --> 07:44.148
he was 2nd Battalion, 7th Marine.

07:44.216 --> 07:45.617
- When?
- '08.

07:45.651 --> 07:48.486
He was spitting distance
from us in Kandahar.

07:48.554 --> 07:50.755
All right, well, they saw some action.

07:50.789 --> 07:52.090
Yeah, they did.

08:04.770 --> 08:06.838
What part of "do not disturb"
you having trouble with?

08:06.906 --> 08:08.506
The Chicago PD part.

08:08.574 --> 08:10.008
Hey.

08:10.075 --> 08:12.944
Look, I-I... I didn't know.

08:12.978 --> 08:14.112
It's okay. I understand.

08:14.146 --> 08:15.113
We all look alike.

08:15.147 --> 08:16.814
African-Americans?

08:16.849 --> 08:17.949
Wha...

08:17.983 --> 08:19.183
Cops...

08:19.251 --> 08:21.452
the same cops who heard that

08:21.487 --> 08:23.588
apparently you're the guy to talk to.

08:23.622 --> 08:24.856
About what?

08:24.924 --> 08:27.792
About your buddy Tyler right here.

08:27.826 --> 08:29.494
I met him at a party I DJ'd.

08:29.528 --> 08:30.795
I didn't know him that well.

08:30.829 --> 08:32.030
Really?

08:32.097 --> 08:33.664
Then why you been calling
him day and night?

08:33.698 --> 08:35.633
He did a little work
for me at the parties,

08:35.668 --> 08:38.169
providing refreshments.

08:38.203 --> 08:40.538
Refreshments?

08:40.606 --> 08:41.873
Okay, it's... it's not like that.

08:41.941 --> 08:44.542
- I'm talking beer...
- Tony, please.

08:44.610 --> 08:47.045
Don't act as stupid as that
haircut makes you look.

08:47.112 --> 08:48.947
You guys were running dope together.

08:48.981 --> 08:50.982
Right? Tony...

08:51.016 --> 08:52.684
I... I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:52.718 --> 08:54.619
I'm a... I'm a Phi Beta
Kappa honor student,

08:54.653 --> 08:56.287
and I've got a chem
midterm on Friday, so...

08:56.322 --> 08:58.156
Let me guess what happened.

08:58.190 --> 09:00.825
Tyler... he wanted a little
bit bigger cut, right?

09:00.859 --> 09:02.627
So you take a baseball bat...

09:02.661 --> 09:03.861
crack him in the head with it.

09:05.998 --> 09:07.665
Damn.

09:10.903 --> 09:14.572
Hey, Officer, do you mind
if I grab my wallet?

09:14.640 --> 09:16.240
I don't want you, you know, shooting me

09:16.308 --> 09:17.842
as I reach for it, so...

09:21.880 --> 09:24.182
Yeah, any more questions,
contact my lawyer.

09:24.216 --> 09:25.817
Wow, you have one on retainer.

09:25.851 --> 09:27.218
Yeah, this conversation's over.

09:29.588 --> 09:31.055
For now.

09:33.225 --> 09:34.859
It's never gonna end with that guy.

09:34.893 --> 09:37.697
There's got to be
something that we can do.

09:37.722 --> 09:39.489
Private security, I guess?

09:41.100 --> 09:42.533
Ride out the year.

09:42.568 --> 09:44.228
Bid back into 21st legit,

09:44.268 --> 09:45.802
and then no one can touch you.

09:48.270 --> 09:49.437
Hey, are you okay?

09:49.462 --> 09:50.629
Did somebody hurt you?

09:50.708 --> 09:52.676
My mom... she hurt my dad real bad.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.244
Call it in. What's your name, buddy?

09:54.312 --> 09:55.579
- Chase.
- 2113, this is an emergency.

09:55.647 --> 09:56.680
Roll another squad to
32nd and Princeton.

09:56.714 --> 09:57.848
You got a last name?

09:57.882 --> 09:58.915
Chase, you're gonna be fine.

09:58.983 --> 10:00.317
- We're gonna help your dad.
- Okay.

10:00.351 --> 10:01.518
Hey, look at me. We're gonna help you.

10:01.552 --> 10:03.487
All right?

10:03.521 --> 10:05.522
That's my house, the one with the flag.

10:05.556 --> 10:06.890
Chase, can you stay with these officers?

10:06.924 --> 10:08.592
- Yeah?
- Yeah, go in the back.

10:13.731 --> 10:15.399
Hey.

10:18.436 --> 10:19.670
Chicago PD!

10:22.540 --> 10:24.241
Clear.

10:24.275 --> 10:25.542
- Clear.
- Sir?

10:25.576 --> 10:27.411
Chicago PD. Don't move.

10:27.445 --> 10:29.713
Got you, Tay. Coming up behind.

10:29.747 --> 10:33.550
- Clear.
- Sir, I need to see your hands.

10:33.584 --> 10:35.552
Sir, do not move your
hands from that table!

10:35.586 --> 10:37.954
Chicago PD!

10:38.022 --> 10:40.390
Help me.

10:40.425 --> 10:41.692
Please.

10:41.726 --> 10:43.260
I don't want to die.

10:44.362 --> 10:45.529
Help.

10:49.538 --> 10:50.634
Is he gonna be all right?

10:50.659 --> 10:54.128
We'll know more when we get to Med.

10:54.163 --> 10:56.831
Where's your mom?

10:57.295 --> 10:59.396
Hey. Chase?

10:59.421 --> 11:01.589
Can you tell me where your mom is?

11:01.623 --> 11:03.758
I don't know.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.559
It's okay.

11:05.594 --> 11:08.262
Hey, it's okay.

11:08.296 --> 11:10.331
Don't worry.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.301
And that's when your wife got violent?

11:14.336 --> 11:17.671
Yeah, my ex.

11:19.674 --> 11:22.743
We had words. She went nuts.

11:22.778 --> 11:26.313
Stabbed me with a steak knife.

11:26.348 --> 11:28.315
But when she saw the blood,

11:28.350 --> 11:30.184
she panicked and ran out.

11:33.288 --> 11:34.855
She, um...

11:34.923 --> 11:36.690
she ever do anything like this before?

11:37.793 --> 11:39.360
No.

11:39.427 --> 11:40.861
Just a lot of bitching.

11:42.464 --> 11:44.532
But I'll take the knife every time.

11:45.934 --> 11:49.470
And Chase was where for all of this?

11:49.504 --> 11:51.972
Napping.

11:52.007 --> 11:54.675
I couldn't find my phone.

11:54.709 --> 11:57.378
So I yelled for him.

11:57.445 --> 12:00.548
He came in.

12:00.615 --> 12:03.684
He was crying.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.886
He hugged me.

12:07.889 --> 12:09.890
That's how come he got blood on him.

12:11.626 --> 12:14.228
Then he ran to get help.

12:14.296 --> 12:17.832
There's no other immediate
family in Chicago?

12:17.866 --> 12:19.867
- Outside of his mother?
- Yeah.

12:22.003 --> 12:24.471
We both moved from St.
John, Indiana, years ago.

12:26.474 --> 12:29.243
All right, well, we put an
investigative alert on her.

12:30.579 --> 12:32.379
Chase...

12:32.414 --> 12:35.983
Chase'll have to go with DCFS.

12:36.017 --> 12:37.852
Can you take him?

12:40.722 --> 12:43.891
Please?

12:43.925 --> 12:45.426
Just till I get out of here.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.367
You know what, Jay?

12:53.401 --> 12:54.568
It's not your call.

12:54.603 --> 12:57.438
I promised that I would look out for you

12:57.505 --> 12:58.672
when we came home.

12:58.707 --> 13:00.741
That is what I'm doing.

13:00.775 --> 13:02.877
Why are you so insistent
that it has to be right now?

13:04.713 --> 13:05.946
Take a couple months off.

13:06.014 --> 13:07.281
Just clear your head, and then if you...

13:07.349 --> 13:09.783
No, if I wait, the post
will be gone in six months.

13:09.851 --> 13:10.918
All right?

13:10.952 --> 13:12.019
If I don't reenlist now, it's done.

13:12.053 --> 13:13.287
Greg, it's a war.

13:13.355 --> 13:14.889
They're not really turning people away.

13:14.923 --> 13:16.891
Do you have any idea what it's like?

13:16.925 --> 13:20.060
I sit behind that desk and watch
you go out every single day...

13:20.095 --> 13:21.762
go out and see action.

13:21.796 --> 13:23.964
Do you have any idea how
that actually makes me feel?

13:24.032 --> 13:25.699
Then take the police exam!

13:25.734 --> 13:27.568
No, I was born to be a soldier!

13:27.602 --> 13:29.703
A soldier, man!

13:30.972 --> 13:32.940
If it comes down to it, I will die one.

13:32.974 --> 13:34.775
Are you crazy?

13:35.944 --> 13:37.544
Sorry to interrupt.

13:37.579 --> 13:40.381
Your guy from Narcotics, Martinez...
he called back.

13:40.415 --> 13:42.082
They got a line on the
dealer who changed his cut

13:42.117 --> 13:44.084
from lactose to fentanyl.

13:44.119 --> 13:46.320
Thanks.

14:05.106 --> 14:08.442
Black ball cap, black
hoodie, white sneakers.

14:08.476 --> 14:09.743
Heavyset guy?

14:09.778 --> 14:11.111
Yeah, didn't dig the nickname "Chunk,"

14:11.146 --> 14:13.480
so he took a tire iron
to some guy's dome.

14:13.515 --> 14:14.648
Goes by "Red" now.

14:14.683 --> 14:15.816
Quite the entrepreneur.

14:15.850 --> 14:17.418
Been working double shifts...

14:17.452 --> 14:18.752
managing a spot during the day

14:18.787 --> 14:20.421
and handling the cut at night.

14:20.455 --> 14:22.823
Meaning he knows the
source of the supply.

14:22.857 --> 14:23.924
Yup.

14:26.761 --> 14:29.964
Hey, man, I'm looking for two.

14:29.998 --> 14:31.966
Who sent you?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.434
Red, come on, man.

14:33.468 --> 14:35.836
I was here like...
like, three weeks ago.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.638
<i>Come on, man. Cash money.</i>

14:37.672 --> 14:39.440
<i>You know I'm good for it.</i>

14:45.880 --> 14:48.615
All right.

14:48.650 --> 14:49.683
We got a positive.

14:49.718 --> 14:50.718
I repeat, we got a positive.

14:50.785 --> 14:52.519
Black hat, black hoodie, white shoes.

14:56.391 --> 14:59.026
Chicago PD. Let me see your hands.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.527
Hey, Red.

15:00.562 --> 15:03.030
- You know who we are.
- Man, I ain't got nothing.

15:04.466 --> 15:05.666
Oops.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.568
Mustache on Jackson...

15:07.635 --> 15:08.869
I drew it.

15:08.903 --> 15:10.671
My bills.

15:17.846 --> 15:20.080
Man, I don't know nothing about nothing.

15:20.148 --> 15:23.751
Bro, if it was me,

15:23.818 --> 15:25.019
I'd be a hell of a lot more worried

15:25.053 --> 15:26.887
about these drug-induced homicides.

15:26.921 --> 15:28.188
I don't even know what that is.

15:28.223 --> 15:29.556
Nine bodies so far.

15:29.591 --> 15:31.191
I didn't serve any of those hypes.

15:31.226 --> 15:32.192
It's your dope in 'em.

15:32.227 --> 15:33.827
Might as well be your bullet.

15:37.832 --> 15:39.600
So what you looking for exactly?

15:41.536 --> 15:43.070
You've been inside two years

15:43.104 --> 15:45.906
and been picked up how many times?

15:45.940 --> 15:48.008
Hey.

15:49.577 --> 15:51.178
What do you think we're looking for?

15:57.085 --> 15:59.853
All right, but here's the deal.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.724
I'll give you my supplier,

16:03.758 --> 16:04.925
but I'm not a rat.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.701
'Cause this dude, he
ain't one of my boys.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.201
So this don't count as ratting.

16:10.235 --> 16:11.902
Makes perfect sense to me.

16:11.937 --> 16:14.305
Name's Scoot. White dude.

16:14.372 --> 16:15.439
Scoot?

16:15.474 --> 16:17.274
Yeah.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.576
He's really...

16:18.610 --> 16:20.644
white.

16:23.381 --> 16:25.282
What's he look like?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.284
Just a real white dude.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.753
Wear them lumberjack shirts.

16:31.256 --> 16:33.557
One time, I went to him.

16:33.591 --> 16:35.925
I met him at this... this mini-mart.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.628
- Where?
- Right off the lake.

16:37.662 --> 16:39.897
Slid down LSD up north.

16:39.931 --> 16:41.632
Some rich-ass neighborhood.

16:41.666 --> 16:42.900
Lawrence or something.

16:42.934 --> 16:44.335
All right, when was this?

16:44.402 --> 16:46.337
Two Mondays ago.

16:48.940 --> 16:50.307
Check it out.

16:55.447 --> 16:56.680
This is from two weeks ago?

16:56.748 --> 16:57.782
Yeah.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.650
The black dude... never seen him before.

16:59.684 --> 17:01.652
That other guy, he comes
in here every other week

17:01.686 --> 17:05.289
looking for White Owl
cigars and rolling papers.

17:05.323 --> 17:06.690
He loves those blunts.

17:06.758 --> 17:08.192
And you wouldn't believe
how much fuel he burns

17:08.260 --> 17:09.359
in that boat of his, either.

17:09.426 --> 17:10.493
Where can we find him?

17:10.529 --> 17:12.363
What'd he do?

17:12.430 --> 17:14.464
- Parking tickets.
- Okay.

17:14.499 --> 17:16.634
I got you. I don't know where he lives.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.602
But he's got a boat at the marina.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.605
Just a few days ago I had to
take some propane tanks to him.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.339
They were having some kind of rager.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.876
Yeah, I could show you
where the slip is at.

17:26.978 --> 17:28.212
"Whiplash."

17:28.280 --> 17:31.549
- Well, there she is.
- With a gash in the hull.

17:31.616 --> 17:34.185
What if this wasn't a murder at all,

17:34.219 --> 17:35.853
just a high-speed accident?

17:35.887 --> 17:38.455
Either way, we're after a fentanyl ring.

17:42.994 --> 17:45.196
Waypoints for Blind River, Ontario,

17:45.230 --> 17:48.365
Mackinaw City, Michigan, and Chicago.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.370
We ran a quantitative and
qualitative analysis

17:53.405 --> 17:54.839
on the sample from the lake.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.674
It's not coming back as fentanyl.

17:56.708 --> 17:57.808
What are you talking about?

17:57.843 --> 17:59.710
Chemically, fentanyl's a pharmaceutical

17:59.744 --> 18:01.579
designed to treat cancer patients...

18:01.646 --> 18:05.549
potent enough that a molecule
on the head of a pin is deadly,

18:05.584 --> 18:07.585
but if even a molecule's altered,

18:07.652 --> 18:09.320
then technically, it's not
a controlled substance.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.888
That's what I'm talking about.

18:10.922 --> 18:12.756
Do you know how many OD's
we have off this stuff

18:12.824 --> 18:13.757
down at Med?

18:13.825 --> 18:14.758
I do.

18:14.826 --> 18:16.393
But they OD'd on fentanyl

18:16.428 --> 18:17.761
that had been fully processed.

18:17.829 --> 18:18.863
The batch you found in the backpack

18:18.897 --> 18:19.997
hadn't been activated yet,

18:20.031 --> 18:21.532
which I'm assuming they were gonna do

18:21.566 --> 18:22.900
when they got to Chicago.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.569
So you're saying that our batch

18:25.604 --> 18:27.004
is off by a molecule?

18:27.038 --> 18:28.672
That is correct.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.344
Yeah, I got him.

18:33.378 --> 18:34.879
They're coming in right now. Thanks.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.614
Sarge?

18:36.681 --> 18:38.415
- Sarge, you want to see this.
- Yeah?

18:40.385 --> 18:42.453
High-speed impact would be consistent

18:42.519 --> 18:44.621
with blunt force trauma to our vic.

18:44.689 --> 18:45.890
So I think the owner of the boat

18:45.924 --> 18:47.458
is the one bringing the
fentanyl in from Canada.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.428
Just got the test results back from ISP.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.365
Technically, it's not fentanyl.

18:54.399 --> 18:55.699
What?

18:55.734 --> 18:58.936
Apparently the manufacturer's
altered molecules

18:58.970 --> 19:00.271
so that this stuff wouldn't be

19:00.305 --> 19:02.573
on the U.S. government's
controlled substance list.

19:02.607 --> 19:04.375
Until it's activated,

19:04.409 --> 19:05.643
it's basically baby powder.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.912
So we don't have a case?

19:17.255 --> 19:19.091
Excelent.

19:19.278 --> 19:20.433
Perfect, thanks.

19:20.458 --> 19:22.559
And this, um, is Sergeant Platt,

19:22.626 --> 19:23.560
who I've been telling you about.

19:23.627 --> 19:24.692
Hey.

19:24.841 --> 19:26.108
You a Hawks fan?

19:29.644 --> 19:32.445
That's great, because I
really need a wingman

19:32.470 --> 19:33.970
to keep an eye on this game

19:34.038 --> 19:35.739
while I'm chained to this desk.

19:35.773 --> 19:38.208
Will you do that for me?

19:38.242 --> 19:39.543
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19:39.577 --> 19:40.744
Don't forget your shirt.

19:40.778 --> 19:42.479
- Sit right over there, buddy.
- You got it?

19:44.315 --> 19:47.617
Kid's mom takes a
nursing course at Lakeside.

19:47.652 --> 19:49.286
Ends in an hour.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.154
Why would someone stab their husband

19:51.222 --> 19:52.289
and then go to class?

19:52.323 --> 19:54.991
'Cause some people are crazy, Burgess.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.068
Leigh Crewes.

20:05.102 --> 20:06.570
Yeah?

20:06.604 --> 20:08.738
Were you at your ex-husband's
place earlier this morning?

20:08.773 --> 20:10.273
Yeah, so?

20:10.308 --> 20:12.108
Did you have words with him?

20:12.143 --> 20:14.477
He insulted
me and screamed at me,

20:14.512 --> 20:15.612
if that's what you mean.

20:15.646 --> 20:17.614
Did it make you mad enough to stab him?

20:17.648 --> 20:19.149
What?

20:21.085 --> 20:22.452
I didn't stab him.

20:22.486 --> 20:24.521
Gerry's crazy.

20:26.190 --> 20:28.091
He's been making threats for years...

20:28.125 --> 20:29.693
said he'd do anything to keep Chase.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.695
Okay, did you ever file
a restraining order?

20:31.762 --> 20:33.363
Do you have any paperwork
to back this up?

20:33.431 --> 20:35.165
No.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.201
Ma'am, now is the time
to get ahead of this.

20:38.269 --> 20:39.336
You got to tell us the truth,

20:39.370 --> 20:40.503
or you're never gonna
see your kid again.

20:40.538 --> 20:41.504
- No!
- Whoa.

20:41.539 --> 20:42.806
He's not well!

20:42.840 --> 20:44.107
He's been going through
a serious depression.

20:44.141 --> 20:45.108
I understand that, ma'am.

20:45.142 --> 20:46.176
Can you put your hands on the roof?

20:46.210 --> 20:47.611
No way. I didn't do anything.

20:47.645 --> 20:49.112
Ma'am, hands on the roof.
I understand that.

20:49.146 --> 20:50.113
- Put your hands on the roof.
- I'm not kidding.

20:50.147 --> 20:51.281
We'll sort it out later.

20:51.315 --> 20:55.051
I can't believe this! It's okay.

21:07.064 --> 21:09.366
- Detective Olinsky.
- Ms. Clarendon.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.234
Hey. Hi.

21:11.302 --> 21:13.803
Have you...

21:13.838 --> 21:16.339
figured out who killed Tyler?

21:16.374 --> 21:17.540
Not yet.

21:17.575 --> 21:20.410
But I promise to contact
you as soon as we do.

21:20.478 --> 21:22.379
At first, I couldn't bring myself

21:22.413 --> 21:24.347
to go through Tyler's things,

21:24.382 --> 21:28.218
but when I did, I found this.

21:28.252 --> 21:32.389
He was applying to the
Chicago Fire Department.

21:32.423 --> 21:36.693
So are you sure he was
involved in something illegal?

21:36.727 --> 21:39.729
Because I'm going to have
to deal with his loss,

21:39.764 --> 21:42.332
and knowing that maybe he
turned his life around

21:42.366 --> 21:44.768
would give me some comfort.

21:47.872 --> 21:49.839
You can tell me.

21:52.276 --> 21:55.111
I'm sorry, but it's looking
like he was involved.

22:09.894 --> 22:12.095
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Kev.

22:12.129 --> 22:15.098
- What's up?
- How you doing on the case?

22:15.132 --> 22:16.366
Covering every angle.

22:19.537 --> 22:22.305
You got to get this stuff
off the streets, Jay.

22:22.373 --> 22:24.307
I just declared a 16-year-old girl.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.242
Sophomore at Rutherford High.

22:26.277 --> 22:28.745
Her mother found out I had a
brother who's a detective.

22:28.779 --> 22:30.613
She asked me to give you that.

22:32.249 --> 22:34.784
I don't mean to push, man.

22:34.819 --> 22:36.920
I just... I need you to know.

22:36.954 --> 22:38.388
It's not just career junkies.

22:38.422 --> 22:39.489
Kids are dying out there.

22:39.557 --> 22:42.625
Yeah. Okay.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.461
All right.

22:44.495 --> 22:46.296
- Got it?
- Yeah.

22:46.330 --> 22:49.165
Sarge, boat's owned by John
and Christie Fitzgerald.

22:49.233 --> 22:50.633
They're a well-connected Chicago couple

22:50.668 --> 22:52.502
who made a good chunk of
change in construction.

22:52.570 --> 22:53.636
I just checked with Customs.

22:53.671 --> 22:54.804
As of three days ago,

22:54.839 --> 22:56.172
they've been on vacation in Italy.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.474
Any border crossing to Canada?

22:57.508 --> 22:58.475
None.

22:58.509 --> 22:59.642
But their son, Scott,

22:59.677 --> 23:01.311
attends Central Chicago U.

23:01.345 --> 23:02.645
Goes by "Scoot."

23:02.680 --> 23:05.281
He and Tony Chin were
in Chem I together.

23:05.316 --> 23:06.916
All right, Mouse, get me a
nexus on the phone records

23:06.951 --> 23:09.352
for him, Tony Chin, and Tyler.

23:09.420 --> 23:10.954
And have patrol pick this Scoot up

23:10.988 --> 23:11.955
and bring him in here.

23:11.989 --> 23:13.690
I want to talk to that guy.

23:26.637 --> 23:29.472
You not wanting to be here isn't
gonna work either, Mouse.

23:31.008 --> 23:34.277
- I talked to him.
- I'm not talking to you.

23:34.311 --> 23:35.845
You want to stay, then do your job.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.782
You don't want to stay, that's
a separate conversation.

23:39.850 --> 23:40.950
I've done my job.

23:40.985 --> 23:43.553
I've done my job since
the day I got here.

23:43.621 --> 23:44.821
Busted my ass for you.

23:44.855 --> 23:46.389
I never... never once asked for OT.

23:46.457 --> 23:48.558
And all I'm asking for is a favor...

23:48.626 --> 23:50.827
a favor so that maybe I can live my life

23:50.861 --> 23:52.295
the way that I'd like to.

23:52.329 --> 23:54.397
Don't go out like this, Mouse.

23:56.534 --> 23:57.867
You've come too far.

24:00.404 --> 24:01.704
You know, maybe Voight's right.

24:01.739 --> 24:03.239
Maybe I just need to clear out of here.

24:03.307 --> 24:05.341
What are you gonna do
with your felony record?

24:05.376 --> 24:06.810
You gonna go back to boosting stereos?

24:06.844 --> 24:08.244
That guy on the board...
that could've been me

24:08.312 --> 24:09.412
when I came back here...

24:09.480 --> 24:11.014
high, doing something
stupid and dangerous.

24:11.048 --> 24:13.249
Greg, that is not you.
That's not you now.

24:13.317 --> 24:14.717
I am telling you, Jay,

24:14.752 --> 24:17.554
if I lose my job because
of a bender or whatever...

24:17.588 --> 24:21.257
I'm looking at Tyler, and
that could've been me.

24:21.325 --> 24:22.492
It still could be me.

24:22.526 --> 24:24.761
- No.
- Hey, hey, guys.

24:24.829 --> 24:26.329
We're done here.

24:26.363 --> 24:28.431
Okay? We are on a case.

24:28.499 --> 24:30.266
Mouse, go back to your desk.

24:30.334 --> 24:31.668
Yeah.

24:32.937 --> 24:36.005
Come on.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.507
- Hey.
- I'm, I'm...

24:37.541 --> 24:39.342
I'm gonna get through to him.

24:39.376 --> 24:40.944
And he's gonna be all right.

24:41.011 --> 24:42.745
Listen.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.747
What you two went through

24:44.782 --> 24:48.384
and what you carry is real.

24:48.419 --> 24:50.453
And you know that if you ever
need my help carrying it,

24:50.521 --> 24:51.721
you just have to ask me.

24:51.755 --> 24:53.923
Why are you not listening to him?

24:53.958 --> 24:56.392
Because going back is not
the right move for him.

24:56.427 --> 24:57.694
For you.

24:57.728 --> 25:00.797
Him going back is not
the right move for you.

25:02.399 --> 25:04.968
But if it was... if you were
the one that wanted to go...

25:05.035 --> 25:07.570
would you let anybody stand in your way?

25:14.311 --> 25:15.945
Come on.

25:22.061 --> 25:23.529
How's it going, Scoot?

25:25.264 --> 25:27.899
Mind if I call you Scoot?

25:27.933 --> 25:29.934
I have no idea why I'm here.

25:30.002 --> 25:31.202
Well...

25:31.236 --> 25:34.539
We found a boat in your
mom and dad's name.

25:34.573 --> 25:36.941
It's got a pretty big-sized
dent in its hull.

25:41.380 --> 25:42.580
Okay.

25:45.951 --> 25:48.052
Look, I was running bud.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.554
From Canada.

25:49.588 --> 25:51.455
Super easy. No harm done.

25:51.523 --> 25:54.692
Just a little recreational marijuana.

25:54.726 --> 25:57.295
And then I meet this guy Tony Chin

25:57.362 --> 25:58.563
in my class.

25:58.597 --> 26:00.398
And...

26:00.432 --> 26:02.233
yeah, this is him.

26:02.267 --> 26:04.235
Tony thinks he's a gangster.

26:04.269 --> 26:06.404
But the real guy is his uncle, Mr. Ng.

26:09.274 --> 26:10.908
First name Walter?

26:10.943 --> 26:12.543
Yeah. Yeah, him.

26:14.379 --> 26:17.081
So Tony tells him about our thing.

26:17.115 --> 26:19.550
Next thing we know, Ng is sweating us

26:19.585 --> 26:22.220
to bring in fentanyl on the same route.

26:22.254 --> 26:23.387
And I told Tony, "Hey, man,

26:23.422 --> 26:24.422
"I'll drive the boat;

26:24.456 --> 26:26.123
"I'll get it to the dealers.

26:26.158 --> 26:27.658
But the other stuff, you
got to figure out."

26:27.726 --> 26:30.428
So, like, him recruiting the...

26:30.462 --> 26:32.597
losers to wear the backpacks?

26:32.631 --> 26:34.098
That's all him.

26:34.132 --> 26:35.600
Losers like Tyler.

26:42.975 --> 26:44.675
These the losers you're talking about?

26:48.113 --> 26:49.580
That night...

26:49.615 --> 26:50.648
what happened?

26:53.518 --> 26:54.986
There was a heavy fog.

26:55.020 --> 26:56.520
I didn't want to go, I swear.

26:57.589 --> 26:59.991
But Ng put a gun on the table.

27:01.693 --> 27:04.028
I had no choice.

27:04.096 --> 27:05.463
You don't say no to him.

27:06.798 --> 27:08.132
I don't, anyway.

27:11.370 --> 27:13.638
What did you hit?

27:13.672 --> 27:18.276
I guess Tyler was seasick,
leaning over the edge, and...

27:18.310 --> 27:21.345
I didn't see the buoy until
the boat clipped it.

27:21.380 --> 27:23.114
This is murder

27:23.148 --> 27:24.181
we're looking at.

27:26.685 --> 27:28.519
Maybe...

27:28.553 --> 27:31.022
maybe we can leave some
of it out of the report,

27:31.056 --> 27:34.692
but, I mean, you're gonna
have to help us take down Ng.

27:37.362 --> 27:40.164
What do you mean, help
you bring him down?

27:40.198 --> 27:43.000
We set it up. You go in.

27:43.035 --> 27:44.535
- We got eyes on...
- Like, undercover?

27:44.569 --> 27:47.171
Correct.

27:47.205 --> 27:48.639
Ng is a killer.

27:50.575 --> 27:54.045
How long you think you're
gonna last at Stateville?

27:54.079 --> 27:55.713
Scoot?

28:08.593 --> 28:10.194
You know, what you're going through

28:10.228 --> 28:12.763
is really hard.

28:12.831 --> 28:15.533
But it is all gonna work out, okay?

28:19.237 --> 28:20.438
You know, my mom...

28:20.505 --> 28:24.342
boy, she could get really angry, too.

28:24.376 --> 28:27.745
But I always knew it wasn't my fault.

28:29.448 --> 28:31.782
It's important for you
to realize that, Chase.

28:34.219 --> 28:36.587
My dad's the one who gets real angry.

28:53.405 --> 28:57.608
I don't like
owing people favors.

28:57.642 --> 28:59.477
You and me both.

28:59.544 --> 29:02.780
But is it possible to hack
into someone's phone remotely?

29:02.814 --> 29:04.382
Technically, yes. Legally, no.

29:04.416 --> 29:05.549
Why?

29:05.584 --> 29:07.718
Because this kid Burgess
and Tay picked up

29:07.753 --> 29:09.787
is about to lose his mom
on an agg assault charge.

29:09.821 --> 29:13.090
I need to make sure it went down
the way her ex said it did.

29:13.125 --> 29:15.493
This is the dad's phone
number, name, and DOB.

29:15.560 --> 29:18.429
Okay, well, I will see what I can see.

29:18.463 --> 29:19.764
Thanks, Mouse.

29:19.798 --> 29:22.466
Yeah, you got it.

29:24.336 --> 29:26.771
Hey.

29:26.805 --> 29:28.272
Hey, what's up?

29:28.306 --> 29:30.474
Um, listen, man.

29:33.512 --> 29:35.746
Do whatever it is you need to do.

29:35.781 --> 29:38.516
All right?

29:38.583 --> 29:40.117
I'm behind you...

29:40.152 --> 29:41.752
100%.

29:45.424 --> 29:46.457
Walter Ng.

29:46.491 --> 29:48.359
Hardcore crime boss in Chinatown.

29:48.427 --> 29:49.794
Alleged to be in everything
from prostitution

29:49.828 --> 29:51.462
to high-stakes gambling.

29:51.496 --> 29:53.798
He's been identified as the
source of the fentanyl

29:53.832 --> 29:55.166
coming into Chicago,

29:55.200 --> 29:58.135
so he is responsible by
coercion for Tyler's death.

29:58.170 --> 29:59.437
His operation's slick.

29:59.471 --> 30:01.639
The modified fentanyl
originates in China

30:01.673 --> 30:05.209
and gets shipped to Ng's connect
in Blind River, Ontario.

30:05.277 --> 30:06.377
And our boy Scoot...

30:06.445 --> 30:07.878
he zips up from the marina.

30:07.946 --> 30:10.614
Tony Chin brings a couple of
college kids to mule it down.

30:10.649 --> 30:13.617
Marine unit says they put
oxygen tanks and a GPS

30:13.652 --> 30:15.519
in weighted backpacks
along with the dope.

30:15.554 --> 30:16.687
If the Coast Guard rolls up,

30:16.721 --> 30:19.223
dump the bag, come
back later that night,

30:19.291 --> 30:21.492
press a button, and boom...
floats to the surface.

30:21.526 --> 30:24.161
Then from Canada, they head here,

30:24.196 --> 30:26.163
south of Mackinaw City, Michigan.

30:26.198 --> 30:28.332
They stop to refuel at Rowley's Bay.

30:28.366 --> 30:29.500
Then down into Chicago.

30:29.534 --> 30:31.702
Where Scoot gives the drugs to Red

30:31.736 --> 30:33.204
and several other scumbag dealers,

30:33.238 --> 30:34.572
and they sell it to kids on the street.

30:34.639 --> 30:36.006
We can't touch Ng

30:36.041 --> 30:38.260
because he's modifying the
chemistry of the fentanyl.

30:38.292 --> 30:41.095
Yeah, but as soon as he
processes it here in Chicago,

30:41.120 --> 30:43.956
we can hit him with calculated
criminal drug conspiracy

30:43.990 --> 30:45.072
and accessory to murder.

30:45.104 --> 30:48.207
Any word on why he allows
himself to be called Scoot?

30:49.275 --> 30:51.076
None yet.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.644
Yo, Sarge, you got to see this.

30:52.712 --> 30:54.546
Scoot made contact.

30:55.615 --> 30:57.282
Okay, I'm listening.

30:57.317 --> 30:59.318
They're building a temporary lab.

30:59.385 --> 31:00.452
Tony and me are supposed to meet there

31:00.486 --> 31:01.720
to process the fentanyl.

31:01.754 --> 31:03.055
Good, when and where?

31:03.089 --> 31:05.157
Tonight. Location TBD.

31:05.225 --> 31:06.491
Ng's gonna be there, too.

31:06.559 --> 31:08.994
He's usually there when
you process the fentanyl?

31:10.129 --> 31:12.231
No, but...

31:12.265 --> 31:13.465
what?

31:13.499 --> 31:15.334
Now you don't want him?

31:15.401 --> 31:17.603
Fine, I'll text him...

31:17.637 --> 31:19.638
tell him not to show up.

31:23.276 --> 31:25.477
Ng wants it done, so he'll
be there for pickup.

31:31.017 --> 31:32.985
All lined up, Sarge.

31:34.354 --> 31:36.154
Yeah.

31:37.657 --> 31:39.124
That is a UC phone.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.592
It looks and acts like a regular phone,

31:40.627 --> 31:41.994
so if anybody checks it out,

31:42.028 --> 31:45.097
they won't be able to tell
that it transmits audio to us.

31:46.032 --> 31:47.299
And what's that?

31:47.333 --> 31:48.634
<i>This is a pinhole camera.</i>

31:48.668 --> 31:50.135
<i>Whichever way this is looking</i>

31:50.169 --> 31:52.004
<i>is the way we're gonna be able to see.</i>

31:52.038 --> 31:53.105
<i>Okay.</i>

31:55.541 --> 31:57.276
- This guy's gonna kill me.
- No.

31:57.310 --> 31:58.510
He is.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.178
Scoot, I know you're out
of your element here,

32:00.213 --> 32:02.047
but we are very much in ours, okay?

32:02.115 --> 32:03.482
So trust us.

32:03.516 --> 32:04.650
Relax.

32:04.684 --> 32:06.518
Okay.

32:06.552 --> 32:08.353
- Come on.
- All right.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.705
We're through the south entrance.

32:43.723 --> 32:45.057
We're in.

32:47.727 --> 32:49.094
Switch over.

32:53.199 --> 32:54.666
We're in position.

32:54.701 --> 32:55.767
Standing by.

33:14.587 --> 33:15.787
<i>Mr. Ng sent me.</i>

33:26.766 --> 33:28.300
Okay, there's Tony Chin.

33:28.368 --> 33:29.868
<i>Hurry up. You're late.</i>

33:29.902 --> 33:31.136
<i>Everything ready to go?</i>

33:33.706 --> 33:35.707
Along with some trigger-pullers.

33:42.815 --> 33:44.583
Does anybody see Ng?

33:44.617 --> 33:45.938
<i>Negative.</i>

33:46.103 --> 33:48.146
<i>No, nothing.</i>

33:52.118 --> 33:53.252
There's the buyer.

33:53.286 --> 33:55.020
I don't see Ng, Sarge.

33:55.088 --> 33:56.688
Do you?

33:57.991 --> 33:59.157
Stand by.

34:02.762 --> 34:04.963
Something's not right.

34:04.998 --> 34:06.298
All right, but the converted fentanyl's

34:06.332 --> 34:07.599
about to walk out the door.

34:12.672 --> 34:14.706
He's leaving. Got to go now.

34:14.774 --> 34:16.041
Move in.

34:16.109 --> 34:17.042
Go. Go!

34:17.110 --> 34:18.976
Chicago PD! Nobody move!

34:19.012 --> 34:20.512
Chicago PD! Get back!

34:20.545 --> 34:21.780
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Stop!

34:23.116 --> 34:24.315
Chicago PD! Everybody's hands, now!

34:24.350 --> 34:25.484
- Now, now!
- Back it up!

34:25.518 --> 34:26.685
- Get down on the ground!
- Walk this way.

34:26.719 --> 34:28.387
- Get on the ground!
- Walk this way.

34:28.454 --> 34:31.290
- Keep your hands spread out!
- Get on the ground!

34:31.324 --> 34:33.625
Police! Freeze! Turn around!

34:33.659 --> 34:35.661
Turn around. Turn around.

34:35.695 --> 34:37.228
Don't look at me. Look at the ground!

34:37.297 --> 34:38.664
Don't move!

34:38.697 --> 34:40.197
Drop it!

34:40.233 --> 34:41.466
On your knees.

34:42.668 --> 34:45.107
Get down. Hands behind your back.

34:48.623 --> 34:50.364
Man, why are you cuffing me?

34:50.389 --> 34:51.623
I did what you guys asked.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.091
I knew it, you piece of sh...

34:53.125 --> 34:54.759
- Shut your mouth.
- You're on your own, dude.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.632
Tony Chin.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.733
Stand him up.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.470
Where's your uncle?

35:05.504 --> 35:06.671
He's supposed to be here.

35:06.739 --> 35:08.340
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.175
Yeah.

35:10.243 --> 35:11.509
Well, kid, guess what.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.745
You got caught holding the bag.

35:13.779 --> 35:17.482
Murder, calculated
criminal drug conspiracy.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.583
Haul him in.

35:50.283 --> 35:52.117
You can't park there.

35:58.858 --> 36:01.459
Sergeant Voight to see Walter Ng.

36:02.695 --> 36:04.329
Open that door.

36:06.132 --> 36:07.565
This way.

36:09.468 --> 36:10.802
Policeman coming your way.

36:20.646 --> 36:21.746
What's up, Walter?

36:21.814 --> 36:23.815
Sergeant.

36:25.918 --> 36:28.253
Let me get this straight.

36:28.321 --> 36:31.189
You served up your own nephew?

36:31.223 --> 36:33.325
Man, isn't that against some kind of...

36:33.359 --> 36:35.260
tradition or something?

36:35.328 --> 36:36.261
Tony?

36:36.329 --> 36:37.429
Is that who you're talking about?

36:38.564 --> 36:39.764
Tony's had a drug and alcohol problem

36:39.832 --> 36:41.232
for years now.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.368
Gets to a point where you just,

36:43.402 --> 36:44.769
stop answering the phone.

36:46.339 --> 36:48.606
I got to admit...

36:48.674 --> 36:50.442
we really thought we had you this time.

36:50.509 --> 36:52.277
Whatever that means.

36:52.345 --> 36:56.448
It means you keep running
your illegal card games,

36:56.515 --> 37:00.285
counterfeit watches, massage parlors.

37:00.353 --> 37:02.620
You take your chances; we'll take ours.

37:03.723 --> 37:05.890
But if you pump any more
fentanyl into my city,

37:05.925 --> 37:08.793
they're gonna be pulling
you out of the river.

37:08.861 --> 37:10.261
You understand?

37:11.464 --> 37:12.564
Sure.

37:19.872 --> 37:21.706
That was a yes or no question.

37:24.276 --> 37:25.810
Yes.

37:25.878 --> 37:27.445
I understand.

37:40.993 --> 37:43.395
I tunneled in on that dude's cell phone.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.330
There's something you
should take a look at.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.668
Lord.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.670
Will you send that to Burgess and Tay?

37:52.738 --> 37:54.806
Sure.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.776
And, um, I heard you were looking

37:57.810 --> 37:59.511
to get a felony disappeared.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.352
I mean, how did you even...

38:07.420 --> 38:08.520
Jay told me.

38:17.263 --> 38:20.532
17 Google searches on a
"Journal of Medicine" study

38:20.599 --> 38:23.468
about non-fatal stab wounds?

38:23.502 --> 38:25.003
What?

38:25.037 --> 38:27.439
Were you monitoring my phone?

38:27.473 --> 38:28.606
Is that even legal?

38:28.641 --> 38:29.874
You said your ex stabbed
you in the neck,

38:29.942 --> 38:31.776
but your wound's not
consistent with that.

38:31.811 --> 38:33.978
She's 5'6". You're what, 6'3"?

38:34.013 --> 38:35.480
I was sitting down.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.816
You do a lot of arguing
sitting down, Jerry?

38:37.850 --> 38:40.452
Look, you lost it.

38:40.486 --> 38:42.720
You did a crazy thing.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.322
But if you ever want
to see your boy again,

38:44.356 --> 38:45.957
now is the time to tell the truth.

38:57.036 --> 38:58.970
Nine years of marriage.

39:00.072 --> 39:02.407
I gave up my job so I could stay home

39:02.475 --> 39:03.808
and take care of Chase.

39:05.077 --> 39:07.679
And she walks out for a classmate.

39:08.647 --> 39:11.583
I gave her everything.

39:11.650 --> 39:13.818
And now she won't even talk to me.

39:22.061 --> 39:24.429
So your mom never hurt your dad.

39:24.497 --> 39:25.430
You know that, right?

39:25.498 --> 39:27.599
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.601
'Cause I have somebody here to see you.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.702
- Hi.
- Mom!

39:30.736 --> 39:32.837
Sweetheart.

39:32.872 --> 39:35.607
We're going home, sweetheart.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.575
Thank you.

39:37.610 --> 39:39.043
Yeah.

39:39.078 --> 39:41.012
So then who hurt my dad?

39:43.782 --> 39:45.917
We'll talk about this. We got to go.

40:05.137 --> 40:06.905
- Hi.
- Yes?

40:08.574 --> 40:11.876
So, Tyler can be
buried next to Grace.

40:18.584 --> 40:21.619
Okay.

40:27.393 --> 40:28.993
Look.

40:29.061 --> 40:31.829
It's really easy for a woman
to catch a rep on this job,

40:31.897 --> 40:34.098
whether or not you deserve it.

40:34.133 --> 40:36.634
It looks like I'm never
gonna get the chance to...

40:39.738 --> 40:42.674
Go after what you want, Kim.

40:42.741 --> 40:43.975
Don't wait.

41:02.761 --> 41:03.795
Come on in.

41:06.599 --> 41:08.132
Sergeant.

41:08.167 --> 41:10.868
Yeah?

41:10.936 --> 41:13.171
I just wanted to...

41:13.205 --> 41:15.540
I just wanted to reiterate
my desire and my commitment

41:15.608 --> 41:17.809
to one day be detailed
up to Intelligence.

41:19.778 --> 41:21.446
I know that it was offered once before,

41:21.480 --> 41:25.383
but I felt that I still had
something to learn in patrol.

41:25.451 --> 41:26.718
And I'm glad that I stayed.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.620
Yeah.

41:28.654 --> 41:31.022
But if the opportunity ever
presented itself again,

41:31.056 --> 41:33.725
I... I just want you to know

41:33.792 --> 41:36.027
that it would be the best
decision that you ever made

41:36.061 --> 41:38.563
to have me be a part of your unit.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.639
That's all.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.707
Be ready.

41:51.477 --> 41:52.543
I will.

41:52.578 --> 41:54.646
I am.
