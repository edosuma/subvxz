00:01.369 --> 00:02.968
ANNOUNCER: Previously on
"The Ex on the Beach Reunion,"

00:03.070 --> 00:04.603
- I'm a bad bitch, am I?

00:04.705 --> 00:05.504
- [laughs]

00:05.606 --> 00:06.872
- You don't know what love is.

00:06.974 --> 00:09.675
- When your ass moves like
this, come talk to me.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.411
- AUDIENCE: [screaming]

00:12.513 --> 00:13.712
- [whirring]

00:13.814 --> 00:15.781
- --Lie detector.
- Y'all ready to hear the truth?

00:15.883 --> 00:17.950
- AUDIENCE: [screaming]
- Who you slept with?

00:18.052 --> 00:20.019
- Don't ever [bleep] [bleep]!

00:20.121 --> 00:22.187
- JUSTINA: Darian, you've
been a good boy since the house?

00:22.289 --> 00:23.489
- DARIAN: 100%.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.891
- ANNOUNCER: And tonight,
on part two of the reunion,

00:25.993 --> 00:28.227
"Ex on the Beach" is
saltier than ever.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.763
- It was the worst date
I've ever gone on in my life.

00:30.865 --> 00:31.997
- [laughs]

00:32.098 --> 00:33.899
- He'd be better off
dating a [bleep] trash can.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.401
- [screaming]

00:35.503 --> 00:38.537
- Let me just clear something
up, you've also slept with him.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.606
- Stop it, [bleep]!
[bleep]!

00:40.708 --> 00:41.974
- The deception!

00:42.076 --> 00:45.310
- JUSTINA: This was the cuddle
that broke Twitter.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.779
- You wanna come cuddle?

00:46.881 --> 00:47.980
- AUDIENCE: [applause]

00:48.082 --> 00:50.482
- Did you cheat on
Maya with a porn star?

00:50.584 --> 00:52.017
- It's a simple yes or no.

00:52.119 --> 00:53.719
- I don't even want
to talk about it.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.855
- I want to believe him so bad.
- Have you ever cheated on her?

00:56.957 --> 00:58.991
- Um... Go!

00:59.093 --> 00:59.792
- Hook it up!

00:59.894 --> 01:02.161
- Stop it.
- Hook it up.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.996
- Did you sleep
with Johnny Bananas?

01:04.098 --> 01:05.230
- Alright, wait, pause.

01:05.331 --> 01:07.633
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

01:07.735 --> 01:09.701
- ANNOUNCER: Welcome back to
"The Ex on the Beach Reunion."

01:09.804 --> 01:11.003
Let's get you caught up.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.639
Jay and Morgan left
Malibu in a relationship.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.308
But things turned rotten
after Jay heard rumors

01:16.410 --> 01:17.443
she was cheating on him

01:17.545 --> 01:19.611
with Johnny Bananas
from "The Challenge."

01:19.713 --> 01:21.547
Sounds like Morgan
didn't wait very long

01:21.649 --> 01:23.649
before getting some potassium.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.051
Now Jay's got her strapped
up to a lie detector.

01:26.153 --> 01:30.355
And if Bananas is involved,
then Morgan is sure to slip up.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.791
- Okay, well, Jay,
the stage is yours, baby.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.660
- Let's go.
- Alright, wait, pause.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.029
I'm just gonna take
this off real quick.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.297
- Now we're gonna be honest.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.599
- Because you've hooked
me up to a lie detector test.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.801
- Oh, so now it's honesty.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.169
Okay, go.
Hell, yeah.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.939
- No, no, Jay.
- Go for it.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.273
Why don't you do it?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.542
- Okay, then let me speak
first before you interrupt me,

01:50.644 --> 01:51.944
before you do anything.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.312
You know what?
I will be honest.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.380
I kissed him.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.682
Not in "The Challenge" house.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.851
And I am being 1,000% honest.

01:58.953 --> 02:00.152
I felt awful.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.787
It was when we were traveling.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.522
You called me maybe a day later.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.190
That's when I knew
things were going south.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.693
You broke up with me, and
then it was free game to me.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.229
I was a single woman, and I
will be completely honest--

02:10.330 --> 02:11.830
- You were single for, what?
24 hours?

02:11.932 --> 02:12.798
- Okay, and I--

02:12.900 --> 02:14.166
- You cheated on
me right before,

02:14.268 --> 02:15.300
48 hours before that.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.668
- You know what?
I'm being honest.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.104
We are humans.
We all make mistakes.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.606
- But now it's honesty time.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.108
Now that you're all
hooked up, so let's go.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.377
Hook it up.
Hook it up.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.712
- Stop it.
- Hook it up.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.747
- [cheers and applause]

02:28.849 --> 02:31.150
- Jay, this is your turn.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.018
- â™ª

02:33.120 --> 02:35.120
- Did you make out with Johnny
Bananas on "The Challenge"?

02:35.222 --> 02:36.989
- No.

02:37.091 --> 02:38.357
- Oh!

02:38.459 --> 02:39.658
- AUDIENCE: [groaning,
whistling]

02:39.760 --> 02:40.993
- [bleep]
- I did not.

02:41.095 --> 02:43.195
- Did you sleep with
Johnny Bananas and cheat on me

02:43.297 --> 02:45.397
before breaking up?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.267
- No. Okay, [bleep].

02:48.369 --> 02:49.935
- AUDIENCE: Woo!

02:50.037 --> 02:51.904
- Do you still have
feelings for me?

02:52.006 --> 02:54.106
- No.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.475
- You just lie about everything.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.678
- You know what?
- I'm good. That's it.

02:59.780 --> 03:00.946
That's all I care about.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.481
- You got your closing.
- I'm good.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.649
It was all a lie.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.017
- Okay, guys--

03:05.119 --> 03:06.652
- Morgan, anything
else you wanna say?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.921
- You know what?
Honestly, I have nothing to say.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.923
- Because you got
caught in all your lies.

03:11.025 --> 03:12.991
- Jay, I care about you.

03:13.093 --> 03:14.493
- No, you don't.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.595
You just lied to me
for, like, ten times.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.597
- You know what?
And Jay, whatever.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.299
You can say whatever
you want is lying.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.734
I know how I feel.
I think you're an amazing guy.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.636
I think you're a great guy.
I care about you.

03:24.738 --> 03:25.604
I will care about you.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.239
Should I face the camera?
Hang on.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.441
- ANNOUNCER: Hey, make sure
we get your good side, girl.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.642
- Who gives a [bleep]?

03:30.744 --> 03:32.711
For five seconds--just
be real for five seconds.

03:32.813 --> 03:34.546
I don't give a [bleep].
- MORGAN: Never mind.

03:34.648 --> 03:38.150
Jay, you were literally just
back there hugging me, smiling,

03:38.252 --> 03:40.319
saying, "You know what?
I'm gonna poke your buttons.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.486
It's all gonna be fine."

03:41.589 --> 03:42.888
So where's this energy
coming from?

03:42.990 --> 03:46.558
- --You had been honest with me
forever, right? Guess what?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.260
Had you been honest, it
would've been totally cool.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.461
- I know the truth, Jay.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.996
- JAY: Sit down
if you don't care.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.364
- Jay, if she
would've been honest,

03:52.466 --> 03:54.499
would you have tried
to mend things?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.935
- I would've been
totally cool with it.

03:57.037 --> 03:59.605
- Are you over her, no feelings?
- Nah, I have no feelings now.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.973
- JUSTINA: No feelings. Done.

04:01.075 --> 04:03.442
- Hopefully Jay got the closure
he was looking for.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.010
Let's change lanes
and talk about

04:05.112 --> 04:07.779
a couple with a rocky past.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.014
- ANNOUNCER:
Need a quick reminder

04:09.116 --> 04:10.882
of where Angela
and Nelson stand now?

04:10.985 --> 04:13.986
They left Malibu in limbo after
Nelson's lie detector showed

04:14.088 --> 04:16.288
he still had feelings for Nurys.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.991
I wonder if Angela is
still feeling salty.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.125
- JUSTINE: Angela, this season

04:20.226 --> 04:22.394
you made an instant
connection with Nelson.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.597
But it made his ex, Nurys,
feel some type of way.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.837
- Angela, what is it
about Nelson?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.905
- He knows when to check me,
how to check me,

04:34.008 --> 04:35.974
and I need to be checked.
I need that aggressiveness.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.810
- Nurys, how does it feel
to hear Angela

04:38.912 --> 04:41.280
talk about Nelson that way?
I mean, that's your ex.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.914
- Tell me how you
really feel, Nurys,

04:43.017 --> 04:44.416
'cause you've been
avoiding me for days.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.251
I'm curious.
- You could've came up to me--

04:46.353 --> 04:49.154
- I don't need your
permission, bitch!

04:49.256 --> 04:50.956
And that's the real tea.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.725
- JUSTINA: Nurys, you and Nelson
weren't getting back together,

04:53.827 --> 04:56.328
but you got upset when Angela
didn't ask for your permission.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.596
Why?

04:57.698 --> 04:59.665
- It wasn't that she needed
to ask for my permission.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.867
But, like, at that
point, we were cool.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.736
I just wanted the conversation.
That's all I wanted.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.305
I just wanted you
to tell me, "Hey,

05:06.407 --> 05:08.273
I'm going out with Nelson."
I would've been like, "Cool."

05:08.375 --> 05:10.642
That's all I wanted.
It took me by surprise.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.144
- Then in you're in
an interview saying

05:12.246 --> 05:13.645
you want to smack
[bleep] out of me.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.547
But to my face, you don't
have that same energy.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.815
It's so [bleep] weird.

05:16.917 --> 05:20.385
No, it's weird to me, because
I'm watching it now.

05:20.487 --> 05:24.923
- [indistint arguing]

05:26.293 --> 05:28.126
- --I go into the confessional
and I was pissed?

05:28.228 --> 05:30.696
Yes, I did that last night.
I definitely told you that.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.931
I said I really
don't give a [bleep].

05:33.033 --> 05:37.469
- Nelson, were you surprised
that Nurys got so upset?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.538
- No, not really, to
be honest with you.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.373
She told me she still
had feelings for me,

05:41.475 --> 05:43.375
and I can tell,
the way she talked to me.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.943
And we always had
a good friendship.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.012
I did tell her if she
didn't hook up with Malcolm,

05:47.114 --> 05:48.647
we probably would've
had a chance.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.483
- Farrah, I heard a rumor that
you thought Nelson was cute.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.051
- I'm not entertaining rumors.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.854
That's not attractive.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.255
Next question, thank you.

05:57.358 --> 06:00.158
- Before Farrah sends me to
my damn room, I better move on.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.426
Alright. [chuckles]

06:01.528 --> 06:03.395
- Let's get to the bottom
of where Angela

06:03.497 --> 06:05.163
and Nelson stand now.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.100
Nelson, when you and
Angela left the house,

06:08.202 --> 06:10.535
your relationship
was up in the air.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.471
Tell me what happened
after the show.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.006
- Well, as you saw, she took
the thing right off my head,

06:15.109 --> 06:16.475
you know?
It triggered her.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.442
She was upset.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.810
She wanted nothing
to do with me.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.412
But when we got
back into the house,

06:20.514 --> 06:23.115
I got to talk to her one on one,
and hash things out,

06:23.217 --> 06:25.117
and let her know how
I feel--I truly feel.

06:25.219 --> 06:27.586
And things were good.
We've been on a vacation.

06:27.688 --> 06:28.787
We've been traveling the world.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.889
We went to Paris, spent
Valentine's together.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.491
I met her mom.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.559
Like, I realized
your past catches up to you--

06:34.661 --> 06:38.997
- [siren sounds]

06:39.099 --> 06:40.365
- Hold on a second.

06:40.467 --> 06:41.666
- You know what that means.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.068
- ROMEO: Message in a bottle.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.237
And this man was just giving us
this beautiful speech.

06:45.339 --> 06:49.040
- I'm like, damn, y'all don't
give me a break, do y'all?

06:49.143 --> 06:50.942
- Do you want to finish
what you were saying?

06:51.044 --> 06:53.245
Or, do you want to go
straight to this bottle?

06:53.347 --> 06:56.481
- The bottom line is that I
fell in love with this woman,

06:56.583 --> 06:59.251
and that's it, you know?
I made my mistakes.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.086
- Well, let's see
what's in this bottle,

07:01.188 --> 07:03.422
and hopefully, love wins.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.390
"Nelson, after
leaving the house,

07:05.492 --> 07:08.427
"Angela ended things when she
received DMs from a woman

07:08.529 --> 07:11.897
"who said, 'I've been in a
sexual relationship with Nelson

07:11.999 --> 07:14.966
until recently.' Is that true?"

07:15.068 --> 07:17.335
- Um...

07:17.438 --> 07:19.971
Oh, my god!

07:20.073 --> 07:21.173
- ANNOUNCER: Uh-oh!

07:21.275 --> 07:24.142
Tonight they're revealing
all the dirty secrets.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.677
Better come clean, Nelson.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.279
- [crying] I've never...

07:27.381 --> 07:29.347
experienced this kind
of pain in my life.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.817
- She just does not want
me to be happy at all.

07:31.919 --> 07:35.487
- Nurys, is Darian
a good kisser?

07:35.589 --> 07:38.957
- You're a pathological
[bleep] liar!

07:39.059 --> 07:40.926
- I don't even want
to talk about it.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.294
- [thunderclap]

07:43.997 --> 07:45.797
- [thunderclap]

07:45.899 --> 07:46.965
- ANNOUNCER: Alright, folks.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.800
Welcome back to
"The Ex on the Beach Reunion,"

07:48.902 --> 07:52.070
where we're popping bottles,
but not the good kind.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.239
We're about to find out
if Nelson's been cheating

07:54.341 --> 07:56.575
on Angela all along.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.410
- "Nelson, after
leaving the house,

07:58.512 --> 08:01.513
"Angela ended things when she
received DMs from a woman

08:01.615 --> 08:05.050
"who said, 'I've been in a
sexual relationship with Nelson

08:05.152 --> 08:08.053
until recently.' Is that true?"

08:08.155 --> 08:09.421
- Um...

08:09.523 --> 08:10.388
- [suspenseful music]

08:10.491 --> 08:11.890
- No, I didn't cheat on her.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.625
- AUDIENCE: [groaning]

08:13.727 --> 08:14.759
- [tires screeching]

08:14.862 --> 08:16.962
- ANNOUNCER: Let's break
this situation down.

08:17.064 --> 08:20.098
Angela and Nelson decided to
date after leaving Malibu.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.000
Nelson told Angela he loved her

08:22.102 --> 08:24.636
and took her to
the Bahamas on vacation.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.806
After they got back, a woman
from Nelson's past reached out

08:27.908 --> 08:30.575
to Angela and told her that
Nelson cheated on her

08:30.677 --> 08:32.177
right before the trip.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.145
You got it? Good.

08:34.248 --> 08:37.448
Too bad Nelson can't escape
to the Bahamas right now.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.851
- Nelson, is that true?
- No, it was not true.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.753
That's what I'm saying.
That's what sucks, you know?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.989
The girl is bearing--
She's being malicious.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.758
She just does not want
me to be happy at all.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.861
But for her to go out of
her way to message Angela,

08:49.963 --> 08:52.230
you could've done that a long
time ago, but you didn't.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.499
You went out of nowhere after
you saw me in the Bahamas,

08:54.601 --> 08:55.800
knowing I was with her.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.569
- But you didn't
cheat before the trip?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.638
- No, no, not at all.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.606
- Ang, you alright?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.775
- There's no worse...

09:03.877 --> 09:06.211
pain than someone that hurts you

09:06.313 --> 09:09.648
after you've explained
your pain to them.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.117
And that's what he did to me.

09:12.219 --> 09:15.120
- Aww, give her a hug.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.788
- I do want to say that

09:16.890 --> 09:19.925
I didn't leave the house
in love with him.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.593
I grew to love him more than

09:21.695 --> 09:23.929
I've loved anyone
in my whole life.

09:24.031 --> 09:27.933
I've never experienced this
kind of pain in my life.

09:28.035 --> 09:30.201
And I just care for you
so deeply, I don't know why

09:30.304 --> 09:33.104
I can't--I can't just move on.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.406
[cries]

09:34.508 --> 09:37.475
- Have you ever cheated on her?
- No, not at all.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.244
- JUSTINA: Angela,
do you believe him?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.346
- I want to so bad.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.615
It's his word against her word.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.750
It was, like, pulling teeth
to get that from her after

09:45.852 --> 09:48.687
she messaged me
this long message

09:48.789 --> 09:50.221
basically telling me
something happened

09:50.324 --> 09:53.058
a few days before he told me
he loved me for the first time.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.927
Even when she sent me the DMs,
he completely was like,

09:56.029 --> 09:57.629
"She's crazy.
I don't know her.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.931
She's from my past,
but we never hooked up."

10:00.033 --> 10:02.100
All that.
Then when stuff came to light,

10:02.202 --> 10:03.535
it was just like
he was cornered.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.537
- Nelson, but just
to get it straight,

10:05.639 --> 10:08.106
you have had a relationship
with the woman in the past.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.709
- Her and I did have sexual
chemistry in the past, yes.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.843
We did before.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.745
Like I said,
I came on to the show single.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.146
I was doing me.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.415
I had nothing stopping me, so
I could--I didn't know I was

10:17.517 --> 10:19.618
gonna fall for somebody
in the house, I really didn't.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.519
I came into the house
to have a good time,

10:21.622 --> 10:24.155
rekindle a friendship,
maybe, and that's it.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.025
- So have you cut things off
with this woman since then?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.460
- NELSON: Deleted her--
- JUSTINA: Completely?

10:28.562 --> 10:30.895
- I haven't even talked to her,
blocked her from everything.

10:30.998 --> 10:35.100
- I want to believe him
so bad, I really just do.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.535
- Is there anything else
you want to ask Nelson?

10:37.638 --> 10:40.939
- I've asked you 100 times
if you cheated on me.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.507
You keep telling me no.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.776
I'm gonna ask you one more time
if you've cheated on me.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.579
And I want you to look me
in the eye and tell me.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.814
- I did not cheat on you.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.716
I love you.
I'm in love with you.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.184
And that's what it is.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.021
- Angela, do you think you
guys can move past this?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.089
- I want to, but
I don't want to look like

10:58.191 --> 10:59.591
Boo Boo the Fool either.

10:59.693 --> 11:02.527
He doesn't have the best past.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.729
I don't--I can't say
that he cheated before,

11:04.831 --> 11:06.898
but he's been accused
of cheating before.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.701
And I just don't
want to be that girl.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.403
- But there is
a lot of love here.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.804
- Yeah, of course.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.206
- Ang is right here
in front of you.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.341
She's crying.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.410
I mean, I want you
to look her in the eye

11:18.512 --> 11:20.378
and tell her how you feel.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.714
- This is kind of hard
and kind of scary for me,

11:22.816 --> 11:25.617
but I know it's quite soon,

11:25.719 --> 11:27.686
but I'm moving to
the East Coast for her.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.154
I really want to
make things work,

11:29.256 --> 11:31.690
and I want to move forward
with her, and I love her.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.224
- Come closer and
give her a hug.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.061
- Aww, yes, give her
a little huggy hug.

11:36.163 --> 11:40.065
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

11:40.167 --> 11:41.099
- Just a quick kiss.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.768
She does have
your face on, you know?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.704
- Y'all 'bout to make me cry.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.540
- JUSTINA: It's good to see that
we have some love in the room.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.842
It seems like, you know,
one of the couples made it out.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.110
- ANNOUNCER: Made it out?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.945
More like making out.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.447
Nelson's spreading love,

11:55.549 --> 11:58.817
but our next ex is spreading
nothing but rumors.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.518
- JUSTINA: Let's change topics.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.588
- Kareem was one of the first
exes to wash up on the shore.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.091
His goal was to
rekindle with Maya.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.859
But when things
didn't go his way,

12:07.961 --> 12:11.396
he decided to trash her instead.
Take a look.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.632
- The real reason Maya hates me
is 'cause my teammate told me

12:14.735 --> 12:16.501
she has something
that wasn't curable.

12:16.603 --> 12:17.969
- [crying] Like, I
don't understand.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.804
It's just, like,
why you chasing me,

12:19.906 --> 12:21.506
and now you're trying
to ruin my reputation?

12:21.608 --> 12:23.141
Like, that's so [bleep] bad.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.409
[sobs]

12:24.511 --> 12:26.311
- I know.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.346
- [whooping, indistinct chatter]

12:28.448 --> 12:30.782
- ROMEO: Maya, did you think
that Kareem was capable of

12:30.884 --> 12:32.150
betraying you like that?

12:32.252 --> 12:34.652
- No, I mean, that's why I
started crying, because, like,

12:34.755 --> 12:36.287
me and Kareem dated years ago.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.723
And I don't feel like--even
though, like, he cheated, like

12:38.825 --> 12:40.458
I don't think
we ended on a bad term.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.926
Like, I'm not a bitter ex.

12:42.028 --> 12:45.196
So when he brought it up,
especially on TV,

12:45.298 --> 12:47.999
especially with people that I
just met, like, the day before,

12:48.101 --> 12:50.602
it really hurt me.
So I did feel betrayed.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.403
- This cat was using
Maya for attention.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.073
Who goes on a show and says,
"I want to get this woman back"

12:55.175 --> 12:56.941
and then says STDs?
Come on now.

12:57.043 --> 12:58.309
That doesn't make any sense.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.644
That [bleep] for attention.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.646
That's the kind of man that
doesn't deserve to be

13:01.748 --> 13:03.148
on the stage,
to be honest with you.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.849
- This little boy [bleep]
shut the [bleep] up.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.619
Wasn't nobody talking to you.
- I'm talking. I'm talking.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.721
- Worry about yours, boy.
- I got mine. We good.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.990
[bleep] you did that
for [bleep] attention, Maya.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.892
- [indistinct arguing]

13:13.994 --> 13:15.293
- Wasn't nobody
even talking to you.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.594
Shut the [bleep] up!

13:16.696 --> 13:20.431
- Now, Kareem, be real--
What did you expect to happen

13:20.534 --> 13:21.800
by starting that rumor?

13:21.902 --> 13:24.035
- I do want to
just say, you know,

13:24.137 --> 13:26.504
regardless of how I
feel and, you know,

13:26.606 --> 13:29.440
what was going on at that time,
it was wrong for me to even

13:29.543 --> 13:31.142
bring up that topic with anyone.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.911
Unfortunately, you know,
I can't take it back,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.113
but I definitely regret
bringing that up

13:35.215 --> 13:38.249
and taking her back down
that lane again.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.719
- Farrah, you put Kareem in time
out by sending him to his room.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.088
That was hilarious!
- KAREEM: And I went, too!

13:44.191 --> 13:45.557
- JUSTINA: You did.
You listened.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.492
What was your opinion of him?

13:47.594 --> 13:48.960
- I just think it was needed.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.261
I'm sure we all agree.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.896
Time apart is nice.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.498
- Yeah, that
was the mom in you,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.633
'cause he listened right away.
He was like, "Okay."

13:55.735 --> 13:57.669
- Magical powers.

13:57.771 --> 13:59.838
- Maya, do you forgive him?

13:59.940 --> 14:02.207
- Yes, I forgave him
off the show.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.075
But I didn't really
forgive him on the show,

14:04.177 --> 14:06.678
'cause I have trust issues,
and I just didn't know

14:06.780 --> 14:08.079
if his apology was genuine.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.315
But I feel like off
the show, we talked.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.916
He apologized, he
apologized, he apologized.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.318
He still does to this day.

14:13.420 --> 14:16.354
So I feel like he's genuinely
sorry, because it's off camera.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.689
He's not in front of everyone.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.190
So I do feel like it's genuine.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.159
- JUSTINA: Definitely, for sure.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.894
Maya closed the book on Kareem

14:22.996 --> 14:25.530
to start a new chapter
with Malcolm.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.998
- I'm Malcolm Drummer.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.101
My biggest problem is sometimes,
I can just love too many women.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.337
I'm looking for someone I
can really call my wife.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.672
You can turn a player
into a housewife.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.208
- Definitely, like, as long
as he doesn't [bleep] up,

14:37.310 --> 14:39.344
he'll score.
Now, will I tell him that?

14:39.446 --> 14:41.246
No.
You're cool people.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.517
- Malcolm, you always seemed to
be caught in a love triangle.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.553
Why are things so
complicated for you?

14:48.655 --> 14:50.822
- I got a lot of love to give

14:50.924 --> 14:52.490
but I wasn't in a triangle
this season.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.359
- You weren't?
- I don't think I was.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.693
This season, I was
just with Maya.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.395
If I was with Maya,
I was with her.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.330
Me and Nurys got it popping,
like, what? One night?

14:59.432 --> 15:00.732
And that was it.
And then--

15:00.834 --> 15:03.101
- Didn't you put, like,
a little crush vote for Didi?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.036
- I put in a crush vote
for Diandra.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.204
I got love for 'em.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.906
I'ma always have love
for 'em, no matter what.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.142
- Alright, Nurys, Diandra,
where do you and Malcolm stand?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.411
I wanna know, are y'all cool?
- I'm not friends with him.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.113
- ROMEO: You're not
friends with Malcolm?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.247
Cut off?
- Yeah.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.182
- ROMEO: Blocked?
- Yeah, blocked.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.684
- Why aren't you
friends with me, Nurys?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.519
- Because--because we
talked about everything.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.221
We realized that
you're fake as [bleep].

15:23.323 --> 15:25.723
- JUSTINA: Maya, Malcolm
hooked up with Nurys

15:25.825 --> 15:27.959
and didn't think twice
about dropping you.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.494
How did that make you feel?

15:29.596 --> 15:31.796
- When he moved on
with Nurys, I'm not gonna lie,

15:31.898 --> 15:33.965
I did feel some type of way,
because he did say

15:34.067 --> 15:36.034
he didn't have feelings
for any of his exes.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.436
So, like, even though we're off,
I would never think he would

15:38.538 --> 15:40.571
go back to someone that you
said you didn't care about.

15:40.674 --> 15:43.007
- ROMEO: Alright, now, Malcolm,
you lost interest in Nurys

15:43.109 --> 15:44.575
when you saw her
talking to Nelson.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.344
Why give up so quickly?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.446
- Nelson came into the crib,
you feel me?

15:48.548 --> 15:50.281
I just seen, like,
a lot of mixed emotions

15:50.383 --> 15:52.917
that I just wasn't rocking with.
I didn't want to stay for it

15:53.019 --> 15:55.486
when there was somebody else
in the house

15:55.588 --> 15:56.621
who was interested in me.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.389
So I didn't want to
stay for somebody

15:58.491 --> 15:59.590
who has feelings
for someone else.

15:59.693 --> 16:01.159
- ANNOUNCER: Here's what you
might not know--

16:01.261 --> 16:02.827
Maya and Malcolm
left the house in love

16:02.929 --> 16:04.529
and immediately
moved in together,

16:04.631 --> 16:06.564
because that
sounds like a great idea.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.467
And it wasn't long before Maya
suspected Malcolm was cheating.

16:09.569 --> 16:13.137
So she kicked him to
the curb--literally.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.640
- ROMEO: Maya and Malcolm,
what happened after the house?

16:15.742 --> 16:19.177
- I moved to the East Coast
for her. I left my crib.

16:19.279 --> 16:22.080
I left everything, the [bleep]
car, and I moved in with her,

16:22.182 --> 16:24.215
to really fight for it
and, like, give it a try.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.518
So I just felt like I couldn't
give it to her, honestly, man.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.387
So I was just doubting
the relationship.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.489
I'm not gonna lie--
I turned kind of into, like,

16:31.591 --> 16:33.758
a little monster.
I can't flex, you feel me?

16:33.860 --> 16:36.227
But me and her said some
awful things about each other.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.462
- Can we let Maya speak?

16:37.564 --> 16:39.263
- JUSTINA: Malcolm?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.299
- [bleep], [bleep],
[bleep], [bleep].

16:41.401 --> 16:42.900
[mutters incoherently]

16:43.003 --> 16:44.202
- AUDIENCE Woo!

16:44.304 --> 16:45.503
- [mutters incoherently]

16:45.605 --> 16:46.504
- What?

16:49.976 --> 16:51.909
- I don't even want
to talk about it, bro.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.345
- Did you cheat on
Maya with a porn star?

16:54.447 --> 16:56.047
- I didn't go home with him
that night.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.415
You went home with
somebody else.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.685
- Let me just clear something
up before anyone else does.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.753
- AUDIENCE:
[screaming, applause]

17:01.855 --> 17:03.021
- [thunderclap]

17:05.759 --> 17:06.858
- ANNOUNCER: Alright, folks,

17:06.960 --> 17:08.859
welcome back to
"The Ex on the Beach Reunion."

17:08.962 --> 17:11.762
Malcolm started to tell us
why he and Maya broke up,

17:11.865 --> 17:16.501
when suddenly, he put the ex in
exit and walked off the stage--

17:16.603 --> 17:19.369
Only to change his mind
and come right back.

17:19.472 --> 17:22.573
- This is my first time
seeing her after all this.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.942
After all the drama, all
[bleep], this is my first time

17:25.045 --> 17:27.045
seeing her. I ain't gonna lie,
when it come to her,

17:27.146 --> 17:28.378
I'm emotional.
- JUSTINA: I hear you.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.281
- She mean a lot to me.
- JUSTINA: Aww!

17:30.383 --> 17:32.216
- No, I did not.
- No, she really did.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.384
Maya, you know I don't cry.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.752
Have I ever cried
for you before?

17:34.854 --> 17:35.987
- No.
- Thank you.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.955
I do apologize, Maya.
I should've done better.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.557
You are an amazing person.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.193
- Now he says it.
- Maya, you seem really hurt.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.895
You tell us, what's
your side of the story?

17:43.997 --> 17:45.129
Why did you guys break up?

17:45.231 --> 17:46.597
- Okay, for me...

17:49.169 --> 17:50.802
I'm starting to cry.
I'm sorry.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.304
For me, like, he's
not my typical type.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.973
I'm not gonna lie, usually,
I go for [bleep] with money.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.942
This was the first time
that I thought, like,

17:58.044 --> 18:00.578
with my heart and not,
like, with my mind

18:00.680 --> 18:02.413
or what I can benefit
from this situation.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.616
And then, when I find out that
he's going to people

18:05.718 --> 18:08.786
I did not like, and going to
others, and cheating on me.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.655
I'm smart.
I'm not no dumb bitch.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.859
And, like, I never, ever, ever
in my life thought that a man

18:14.961 --> 18:17.361
would cheat on me and then
come and lay beside me.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.330
And there would be times where
he wouldn't come home

18:19.432 --> 18:21.365
and I'd call Janelle, like,
"Bitch, what do I do?

18:21.468 --> 18:23.568
Like, I don't know how to
deal with this [bleep]."

18:23.670 --> 18:25.937
Like, I've never lived
with a guy before.

18:26.039 --> 18:28.139
And it's like, he would
promise me so many times

18:28.241 --> 18:30.041
he's not cheating on me,
it's not that.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.143
But then when I find out
from talking to them,

18:32.245 --> 18:34.979
they show me receipts of him
on Facetime with other girls

18:35.081 --> 18:36.180
and [bleep] like that.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.016
So for me, like, it just
hurt because, for once,

18:39.119 --> 18:40.918
I felt like I was being genuine.

18:41.020 --> 18:44.522
I had a porn star DM me and
send me pictures of him

18:44.624 --> 18:46.624
laying in the bed with her.
- Those were the receipts?

18:46.726 --> 18:48.326
- MAYA: Yeah, she sent it to me.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.261
- Did you cheat on
Maya with a porn star?

18:50.363 --> 18:52.430
- MALCOLM: Um...
- Yes. Next question.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.332
Yes, he did.
- Can I tell my story, Maya?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.434
- MAYA: Okay.
It's a simple yes or no, right?

18:56.536 --> 18:57.835
- But I kinda
wanna explain myself.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.170
- Alright.
- If that's okay.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.638
- He [bleep] her and--

19:00.740 --> 19:02.473
- When that did happen
with me and Kendra,

19:02.575 --> 19:04.408
me and Maya was not
in a good place.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.644
- She said that you cheated.
Is that true?

19:06.746 --> 19:09.147
- Okay, yeah, that's true.
But like I said--

19:09.249 --> 19:10.948
- JUSTINA: You did cheat?
- He did cheat.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.650
- It was a bad time
in our relationship.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.086
We had taken some time off.
I was staying at my boy's crib.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.688
- He told us that him and
Maya weren't really together,

19:17.790 --> 19:19.657
that they had an
understanding--word for word,

19:19.759 --> 19:21.058
so don't even [bleep] lie.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.194
That they had an understanding
he was staying at her crib

19:23.296 --> 19:24.295
and he could [bleep]

19:24.397 --> 19:26.330
Basically do
whatever he wanted to do.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.900
- Do I really look like
the type of bitch

19:29.002 --> 19:30.835
to let a guy live with me

19:30.937 --> 19:33.971
and [bleep] other girls,
and we not be [bleep] together?

19:34.073 --> 19:36.007
Do you wanna know
how disgusting he is?

19:36.109 --> 19:37.508
- That was one time.
- Shut up!

19:37.610 --> 19:39.510
That you would literally
live with me--

19:39.612 --> 19:41.078
That you lived with me,

19:41.181 --> 19:43.247
and that you went with
a [bleep] I didn't like.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.516
And you went and you [bleep]
told them [bleep] about me.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.585
You lied.
So what do you mean?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.654
- Did you ever apologize
to her for that?

19:49.756 --> 19:51.789
- No, because this is the first
time he's ever admitted

19:51.891 --> 19:54.292
that he's cheated on me.
He lied to me and said no.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.160
- Until now?
- Until this second.

19:56.262 --> 19:57.695
- Can you just apologize?

19:57.797 --> 19:59.063
- I apologized plenty of times.

19:59.165 --> 20:01.065
I'm trying to, like,
over and over again.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.200
- She said you didn't.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.701
- Just say, "Maya, I'm
sorry for cheating.

20:03.803 --> 20:04.835
I'm sorry for lying
about cheating."

20:04.938 --> 20:06.504
- Maya, I'm sorry for cheating.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.306
I'm sorry for lying
about cheating.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.409
- Maya, it's so sad to see
where you and Malcolm ended.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.411
We hope both of you
find the one.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.580
Let's take a break.
We got a lot more

20:15.682 --> 20:17.248
"Ex on the Beach Reunion"
coming up.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.749
- AUDIENCE: [applause]

20:18.851 --> 20:20.818
- ANNOUNCER: Uh-oh, looks like
the reunion capsized

20:20.920 --> 20:22.653
another relationship.

20:22.755 --> 20:25.022
Coming up, Cory Z
joins the party,

20:25.124 --> 20:28.626
and it turns out Murray isn't
his only ex on the stage.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.328
- I went home with
somebody else.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.462
- It was all bull [bleep].

20:31.564 --> 20:32.530
- AUDIENCE: [groaning]

20:32.632 --> 20:35.199
- Oh, bitch, you
think this is funny!

20:35.301 --> 20:38.402
- You're a pathological
[bleep] liar!

20:38.504 --> 20:40.171
- AUDIENCE: [screaming]

20:40.273 --> 20:41.439
- [thunderclap]

20:43.476 --> 20:44.242
- [thunderclap]

20:44.344 --> 20:45.543
- ANNOUNCER: Welcome back.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.878
This season, Cheyenne decided
to give his ex, Murray,

20:47.981 --> 20:49.247
another shot.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.516
But their plans backfired
when Murray's ex, Cory Z,

20:52.619 --> 20:55.686
exposed Murray for still
having a boyfriend.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.789
Did Murray and Cheyenne
get tied down after Malibu?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.158
Or, did they wave goodbye?

21:03.062 --> 21:05.396
- Now joining us,
say what up to Cory Z.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.898
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

21:08.001 --> 21:09.200
- Now, Cheyenne found love

21:09.302 --> 21:11.535
when he rekindled
with his ex, Murray.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.804
But their love was tested
over and over

21:13.906 --> 21:15.940
by every ex that appeared
in the waves.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.610
Now, Cheyenne,
what is it about Murray

21:19.712 --> 21:21.145
that you found attractive?

21:21.247 --> 21:22.713
- Um...

21:22.815 --> 21:27.118
honestly, Murray and I, our
relationship in the beginning,

21:27.220 --> 21:29.487
when I first met him,
he was one of the first people

21:29.589 --> 21:32.290
I fell in love with, and
I magnetized towards that.

21:32.392 --> 21:36.560
He has a very hard way of
giving away his full self,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.829
and I'm a little bit
of a digger.

21:38.931 --> 21:43.267
And I'm gonna try and get to
the deeper layers of a person.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.670
And I knew they were
in there, but...

21:45.772 --> 21:47.004
I never found them.

21:47.106 --> 21:50.207
- Murray, do you think that
Cheyenne was more into you

21:50.310 --> 21:51.609
than you were into him?

21:51.711 --> 21:53.978
- No, I think that we both
went in the house--actually,

21:54.080 --> 21:56.247
I know we both went into
the house with the same mindset.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.482
You know, I just had
a completely open mind

21:58.584 --> 21:59.784
to see what would happen.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.786
Um...

22:01.888 --> 22:04.188
- That house changes a lot
of those things, though.

22:04.290 --> 22:05.423
- That house does change--

22:05.525 --> 22:07.258
- It changed it for
every one of us.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.760
- I saw him and Cheyenne, and
I could tell that Cheyenne

22:09.862 --> 22:12.363
was really into him, because--
Feeling a lot for him again.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.798
And I could tell he wasn't.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.300
It was all bull [bleep], because
he does have a boyfriend.

22:16.402 --> 22:17.902
Why are you coming
on a dating show

22:18.004 --> 22:19.270
when you have a man?

22:19.372 --> 22:22.440
- MURRAY: At no point
did I have a boyfriend.

22:22.542 --> 22:23.974
- CORY: Yes, you still have
a boyfriend.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.309
You can call it single,

22:25.411 --> 22:27.011
whatever makes you feel better
to [bleep] somebody else.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.913
But you're still [bleep] someone
else and [bleep] him over.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.881
You're with him.
In his mind, you're together.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.483
Yes, you are.
- Absolutely not.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.851
- Why is he sitting by me?

22:33.953 --> 22:36.187
- Why am I sitting
this close to Cory Z?

22:36.289 --> 22:37.722
- I can't.
- I haven't dated anybody.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.857
I haven't dated anybody
since I got on to the show.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.225
- This is the only
consistent thing

22:41.327 --> 22:42.593
that I've ever gotten from you,

22:42.695 --> 22:44.362
and him as well,
and now Nick, too,

22:44.464 --> 22:46.864
and several other people,
is that you do do that.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.567
You drag people on, and you
lead them to believe one thing,

22:49.669 --> 22:53.537
and you go and do whatever it
is that you want on the side

22:53.639 --> 22:56.307
and just act like
that's not a problem.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.242
You can't ignore those things.

22:58.344 --> 23:02.046
The very night that we left,
and had the cast to your bar,

23:02.148 --> 23:04.281
and you went home with him.
So what did I do?

23:04.384 --> 23:07.051
- I actually didn't go home
with him that night.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.219
You went home with
somebody else.

23:08.321 --> 23:09.587
- I went home with
somebody else--

23:09.689 --> 23:10.855
- You sure as [bleep] did.

23:10.957 --> 23:13.023
- --And left me to host your
night with other people.

23:13.126 --> 23:15.326
- I was there until two
in the morning and you left--

23:15.428 --> 23:17.661
- You went home with Nick!
- So let's clear this up.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.463
Six hours after the show ended,

23:19.565 --> 23:21.332
you were both in bed
with somebody else.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.633
- No, I went home alone.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.603
I had a party, an event that
most of the cast came to.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.405
Everybody's drinking.
Everybody got really drunk.

23:27.507 --> 23:29.140
And Cheyenne went home
with somebody else.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.875
I went home by myself.
- No, you didn't.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.711
- Yes, I did.
- Where did he go? San Diego?

23:33.813 --> 23:36.147
He doesn't have
any friends in I.A.

23:36.249 --> 23:38.315
- I don't know where [bleep]
Nick went on that night

23:38.418 --> 23:40.851
because it was not home with me.
- I knew where he was

23:40.953 --> 23:42.653
after he came out of
that teddy bear costume

23:42.755 --> 23:44.822
the entire time
that we finished filming,

23:44.924 --> 23:46.924
and it was at your house,
sleeping in your bed.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.059
- You've been single since
the ending of the show?

23:49.162 --> 23:50.661
- Yes.
- I'm just asking,

23:50.763 --> 23:54.331
'cause I done seen y'all booty
all on Instagram, so like--

23:54.434 --> 23:55.733
- I've definitely seen
that mother [bleep].

23:55.835 --> 23:57.034
- I'm just asking, like--

23:57.136 --> 23:58.369
- I'm still good
friends with him.

23:58.471 --> 24:00.738
I'm an adult, and
I can have friendships

24:00.840 --> 24:02.673
with my last relationships.
Just because I'm friends

24:02.775 --> 24:04.909
with my previous relationship
doesn't mean--

24:05.011 --> 24:07.845
- Let me just--let me
just clear something up

24:07.947 --> 24:10.347
before anyone else does.

24:10.450 --> 24:14.118
I have a friendship with
your ex-boyfriend, Cory,

24:14.220 --> 24:15.653
and I've also slept with him.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.621
- AUDIENCE: Whoa!

24:17.723 --> 24:20.090
- Yeah, shocker.

24:20.193 --> 24:21.625
- Y'all been [bleep]?

24:21.727 --> 24:23.494
- AUDIENCE: [applause]

24:23.596 --> 24:24.728
- The deception!

24:25.765 --> 24:27.631
The deception, bitch.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.967
- You guys are [bleep] trash.
- Why are we trash?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.503
- Because you're [bleep] trash.
- 'Cause why? Why?

24:32.605 --> 24:34.338
- Cory Z, I want
to hear from you.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.874
How did you and Cheyenne
end up hooking up?

24:36.976 --> 24:40.578
- Uh, we were out, and I don't
know, just kind of happened.

24:40.680 --> 24:44.415
- We were out, and we ended up
kind of commiserating

24:44.517 --> 24:47.985
and swapping stories of
our pain, as people do.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.087
- And swapping spit.
- CHEYENNE: It happens.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.023
But at the same time, I
was single, and so was he.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.460
And we went out one night, had
a fun night, and that was it.

24:56.562 --> 24:58.028
I mean, we're friends now,

24:58.130 --> 25:01.866
and there's no connection
beyond that.

25:01.968 --> 25:05.102
- Well, Cheyenne, can you ever
see yourself working things out

25:05.204 --> 25:06.570
with Murray again?

25:06.672 --> 25:09.740
- I don't foresee us ever being
in a relationship together, no.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.842
I would hope that
we can be civil

25:11.944 --> 25:14.044
and be friends again
at some time,

25:14.146 --> 25:19.850
but I really don't know how
things will go on his end.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.986
- What are your thoughts,
Murray?

25:22.088 --> 25:24.655
- Right now, I just don't care.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.357
- I guess time will tell
if these two

25:26.459 --> 25:28.292
will ever get back
to a good place.

25:28.394 --> 25:31.695
- ANNOUNCER: It seems like those
two find each other unbearable.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.664
- Janelle's departure
didn't stop Darian

25:33.766 --> 25:35.065
from exploring his options.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.635
Coming up, we'll dive
into Darian's betrayal.

25:37.737 --> 25:41.739
- [cheers and applause]

25:41.841 --> 25:44.675
- You'd be better off
dating a [bleep] trash can.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.944
- I [bleep] know what I want
and what I don't want.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.078
- We're just, like, done.

25:48.180 --> 25:51.048
- This was the cuddle
that broke Twitter.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.616
- [thunderclap]

25:54.387 --> 25:56.220
- â™ª

25:56.322 --> 25:58.489
- [cheers and applause]

25:58.591 --> 26:00.591
- Welcome back
to "Ex on the Beach Reunion."

26:00.693 --> 26:03.294
Romeo and I are here with
the singles and exes,

26:03.396 --> 26:06.130
getting the details on
all the house drama.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.465
Let's talk about
Janelle and Darian.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.501
- ANNOUNCER: Quick reminder--
Last week on the reunion,

26:10.603 --> 26:13.103
Janelle and Darian revealed
they're one of the only couples

26:13.205 --> 26:14.371
still together.

26:14.473 --> 26:17.975
But Nurys dropped a bomb
that Darian's been cheating.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.777
Let's take a look back
at their relationship

26:19.879 --> 26:21.545
and see if we can
get to the truth.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.647
- JUSTINA: Janelle was looking
to rekindle with her ex

26:23.749 --> 26:25.215
before he even made it
to the house.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.818
Once Darian arrived, she was
ready to take on anyone

26:27.920 --> 26:29.987
who stood in her way.
Let's take a look.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.424
- So you're single?
- I am.

26:33.526 --> 26:35.326
- GROUP: Whoa!

26:35.428 --> 26:36.961
- No ex-girlfriends?

26:37.063 --> 26:39.096
- Uh, I got a--
I got a few exes.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.464
- Mm-hmm.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.866
- But I feel like I've
moved past that a little bit.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.004
- No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't do it!

26:47.106 --> 26:48.872
- [screaming]

26:48.975 --> 26:50.240
- You bitch!
[bleep]!

26:54.213 --> 26:56.046
You [bleep] kissed her?!

26:56.148 --> 26:57.982
You're gonna kiss her?!

26:58.084 --> 26:59.850
- Be stronger than--
- [bleep]!

26:59.952 --> 27:00.985
- Janelle! Janelle!

27:01.087 --> 27:02.052
- [shouting]

27:04.490 --> 27:06.423
I'll kill you, ho!

27:06.525 --> 27:09.059
- JUSTINA: Wow,
wrestlemania in the house.

27:09.161 --> 27:12.796
Well, Janelle was fired up,
and so were fans on Twitter.

27:12.898 --> 27:15.933
Grace was wondering, "Darian,
you came in for Janelle,

27:16.035 --> 27:18.769
but you got sidetracked
by Diandra. Why?"

27:18.871 --> 27:21.405
- Me coming back on the show,
I wanted to get back with her,

27:21.507 --> 27:24.074
but also, I was hearing
that she moved on.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.711
So I figured, [bleep], I need
to something to see if this girl

27:27.813 --> 27:29.346
still even cares about me.

27:29.448 --> 27:31.248
- But with that
being said, Janelle--

27:31.350 --> 27:32.449
- Mm-hmm?

27:32.551 --> 27:34.652
- --Diandra had no idea
that Darian was your ex.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.454
- Mm-hmm.
That's what she says.

27:37.556 --> 27:40.190
- So why did you
flip out on her?

27:40.292 --> 27:44.795
- Um, let's be clear--
I first attacked Darian

27:44.897 --> 27:46.430
because he's the only person

27:46.532 --> 27:47.965
who's supposed
to have loyalty to me.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.967
So he was the person
I had the problem with.

27:50.069 --> 27:53.370
Once I looked at her,
she was laughing at me.

27:53.472 --> 27:55.739
She smiled, laughed,
chuckled, whatever.

27:55.841 --> 27:59.743
I was just like, "Oh, bitch,
you think this is funny?"

27:59.845 --> 28:00.978
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

28:01.080 --> 28:03.313
- "I bet you don't think
it's funny anymore."

28:03.416 --> 28:04.848
- I wasn't laughing at you.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.216
I literally turned
around and said--

28:06.318 --> 28:07.885
- So you weren't [bleep]
laughing, Diandra?

28:07.987 --> 28:09.820
- --Smile, mid-smile, because
one of the producers smiled.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.288
So I was like,
hm, turned around.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.523
She was like, "Oh,
you're laughing?"

28:12.625 --> 28:13.824
And I'm like, "I
wasn't laughing."

28:13.926 --> 28:16.527
If you want to go ahead
and believe I was laughing--

28:16.629 --> 28:18.996
- If he looked like
"he wanted to kiss you,"

28:19.098 --> 28:20.631
he didn't act upon that look.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.566
You reached in for it.

28:22.668 --> 28:27.738
- Okay, and I'm not saying--
I'm not saying that he's wrong.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.640
- I'm telling you it's fine.

28:29.742 --> 28:32.976
I'm just letting you know
that you went in for it.

28:33.079 --> 28:36.480
- Darian, don't you think that
you also kind of set Diandra up?

28:36.582 --> 28:39.016
Like, when she asked you
if you had a ex, you know,

28:39.118 --> 28:41.452
you didn't say, "Yes, I
have an ex in the house.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.654
She's upstairs. Janelle.
She's gonna whoop your ass."

28:43.756 --> 28:45.622
You kind of set her up.
- Yeah, absolutely.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.725
I should've been
honest with her.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.993
- Well, before
she got sent home,

28:50.096 --> 28:52.796
Janelle kind of begged
Darian for his loyalty,

28:52.898 --> 28:54.231
but he didn't listen.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.133
Check it out.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.835
- [crying] I'm just
saying that, please,

28:57.937 --> 29:00.370
don't break my heart, Darian.
- Okay.

29:00.473 --> 29:02.406
- I just need you to stay
loyal to me,

29:02.508 --> 29:04.408
because I know
I can't deal with that.

29:04.510 --> 29:05.476
- I said I was.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.511
We still have a lot of stuff
to work on.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.150
I know there are
no cameras in here.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.987
- â™ª

29:17.089 --> 29:18.822
- I truly don't want
to disrespect Janelle,

29:18.924 --> 29:20.357
but you're not here, Janelle.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.093
And I think he deserves
someone that treats him well.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.963
And I think that's exactly
what I can give him.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.197
- You think that's you, bitch?

29:27.299 --> 29:28.766
- DARIAN: Not only
did I kiss Didi,

29:28.868 --> 29:30.134
but now I've also kissed Nurys.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.769
But Janelle's not in the house.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.338
So, oh well.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.439
- You're [unintelligible].

29:35.541 --> 29:37.741
- Oh!
[bleep] oh well?

29:37.843 --> 29:41.612
- Janelle, what are you feeling
right now after watching that?

29:41.714 --> 29:43.113
- So "oh well"?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.883
I'm just saying, [bleep] we
got consequences every day.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.551
Like, "oh well"?

29:47.653 --> 29:49.620
Like, ain't nothin'
gonna happen? That's cute.

29:49.722 --> 29:52.322
- Okay, we got another
fan with a question.

29:52.424 --> 29:53.290
Where's Leah?

29:53.392 --> 29:56.393
- Nurys, is Darian
a good kisser?

29:56.495 --> 29:59.496
- Was it worth it? No.
- Oh?

29:59.598 --> 30:01.131
- For me.
- It was a no?

30:01.233 --> 30:02.566
- After everything, no.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.134
So, I mean, it
wasn't the best kiss.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.302
Y'all saw it.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.638
- JUSTINA: Darian, why
couldn't you stay loyal?

30:07.740 --> 30:10.307
- Honestly, I was just--

30:10.409 --> 30:12.876
I was an idiot.
There was nothing else to it.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.145
I made a lot of
mistakes on the show.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.547
- It's disrespect, period.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.615
You don't say that
you want to be with me,

30:18.717 --> 30:21.018
you want to work it out,
I'm the love of your life,

30:21.120 --> 30:22.553
and then you go kiss hoes.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.922
Don't do that.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.991
And I just find it so [bleep]
ironic that he kissed Nurys

30:28.093 --> 30:30.060
out of all of
the [bleep] bitches

30:30.162 --> 30:31.929
in this whole [bleep] damn
situation.

30:32.031 --> 30:35.299
Like, is anyone else noticing
a recurring situation?

30:35.401 --> 30:39.002
You [bleep] are sister wives.
You hop on the same--

30:39.104 --> 30:43.006
- [indistinct arguing]

30:43.108 --> 30:45.409
- For Nurys to say in that clip
you think Darian deserves

30:45.511 --> 30:47.845
somebody better?
Bitch, better is you?

30:47.947 --> 30:50.447
He'd be better off
dating a [bleep] trash can.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.516
Let me just make that
real [bleep] clear.

30:52.618 --> 30:53.884
- To each their own.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.118
- Janelle, here's the thing.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.654
You actually seem
more mad at the girls.

30:57.756 --> 30:59.957
Like, you seem more mad at
Nurys than you do at Darian.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.693
That's your man.
Why not--

31:02.795 --> 31:04.428
- [indistinct arguing]

31:04.530 --> 31:07.531
- DARIAN: I deal with it
nonstop, like non--nonstop.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.233
- Darian gets it the worst
out of everyone

31:09.335 --> 31:10.934
because he lives with me.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.603
My problem is always
with the guy first,

31:12.705 --> 31:16.173
which is why I tackled
him first with Diandra.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.674
Period.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.376
- So, Farrah,
Janelle's your girl.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.411
Do you think Darian
was being shady?

31:21.513 --> 31:23.847
- I just really feel
like Janelle deserves

31:23.949 --> 31:25.515
a better man in general.

31:25.618 --> 31:29.586
I just think Darian needs to
grow up, go live on your own,

31:29.688 --> 31:32.589
go be a man on your own,
go do your own thing.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.758
Janelle has her thing going on.

31:34.860 --> 31:36.293
She needs a stronger man
in her life.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.395
- I feel like you think
I'm trying to attack you,

31:38.497 --> 31:39.897
and I'm trying to tear
down your relationship.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.431
But I'm really just
trying to show you

31:41.533 --> 31:42.866
you do deserve better.

31:42.968 --> 31:44.902
I don't know why
you think I'm over here trying

31:45.004 --> 31:46.803
to do this out of malicious
intent, I'm really not.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.439
- You literally have been
telling every single person

31:49.541 --> 31:50.941
since [bleep] New Year's

31:51.043 --> 31:53.377
that Darian [bleep]
a girl [bleep] on camera.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.946
- No, that's what
he said he did.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.749
- No, I did not do that.
I did not do that!

31:58.851 --> 32:01.084
- How is it that
Malcolm even told Maya,

32:01.186 --> 32:03.086
saying that you
hooked up with people?

32:03.188 --> 32:04.187
- Ask him right now!

32:04.290 --> 32:05.722
Let's ask the mother [bleep],
there.

32:05.824 --> 32:06.857
- Malcolm!

32:06.959 --> 32:08.625
- He did not [bleep]
no vagina that night.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.394
- Thank you!
Thank you!

32:10.496 --> 32:13.163
- --Pathological
[bleep] liar!

32:13.265 --> 32:15.132
- So there's a lot
of he say/she say,

32:15.234 --> 32:17.134
and we can't prove anything
without proof, right?

32:17.236 --> 32:19.036
- Right.
- That's what I'm saying.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.805
- ROMEO: But, Janelle, you guys
didn't connect in the house,

32:21.907 --> 32:23.607
but you reconnected
after the house.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.243
So where do you and Darian
relationship stand right now?

32:26.345 --> 32:27.878
- I mean, we're in a good place.

32:27.980 --> 32:32.215
Like, I know he loves me more
than anything and anyone.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.017
And I love him, too.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.953
- Well, if it's real love,
it will prevail.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.020
- [tires screeching]

32:37.122 --> 32:38.956
- ANNOUNCER: But it
turns out their love

32:39.058 --> 32:41.024
wasn't so real after all.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.592
Shortly after the reunion,

32:42.695 --> 32:45.128
Janelle got the receipts
she was looking for.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.998
Looks like Darian made out
with another girl.

32:48.100 --> 32:51.101
So she dumped his ass.

32:51.203 --> 32:53.337
- It was the worst date
I've ever gone on.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.638
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

32:54.740 --> 32:56.940
- I don't know what was going
on between you and Jozea.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.775
Like, I know it
was a little weird.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.644
- Yeah, so we just
started making out.

33:00.746 --> 33:01.912
- AUDIENCE: [screaming]

33:02.014 --> 33:03.280
- [thunderclap]

33:05.484 --> 33:07.117
- â™ª

33:07.219 --> 33:09.619
- [cheers and applause]

33:09.722 --> 33:10.988
- Welcome back.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.824
In the season finale, we saw
Corey Brooks crush himself.

33:13.926 --> 33:17.194
Corey, after things didn't work
out between you and Morgan,

33:17.296 --> 33:19.496
why didn't you try and
pursue anyone else?

33:19.598 --> 33:21.865
- I just wasn't, like,
super passionate about anybody.

33:21.967 --> 33:23.300
I just wanted to have fun.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.003
Um, you know, again,
I [bleep] know what I want

33:26.105 --> 33:28.772
and I know what I don't want.
And I love everybody here,

33:28.874 --> 33:30.607
but I just didn't want
to pursue anybody.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.610
- Now, Morgan, if you could
set Corey up with anyone

33:33.712 --> 33:35.746
in the house,
who would you pair him with?

33:35.848 --> 33:37.314
- Hmmm...

33:37.416 --> 33:38.749
- And don't say Jozea.

33:38.851 --> 33:42.953
- Fine, fine, fine, fine.
Um, Farrah. Sorry.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.654
- Thank you, Morgan, for that.

33:44.757 --> 33:47.190
- JUSTINA: You guys went out
on a date we didn't see.

33:47.292 --> 33:48.625
What was that like?

33:48.727 --> 33:51.395
- It was, like, the worst date
I've ever gone on in my life.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.530
- [laughs]
- It was not!

33:53.632 --> 33:56.033
You've definitely been on worse.
- I think so.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.035
- 'Cause you didn't
get a good night kiss?

33:58.137 --> 34:00.604
Is that why--
- I don't need kisses.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.672
- Corey, you're still trying
to get that good night kiss.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.508
- No, I'm good.
- JUSTINA: No?

34:04.610 --> 34:07.978
- Well, nothing says
love like that first kiss.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.715
Here's a look at the first kiss
no one ever saw coming.

34:11.817 --> 34:17.654
- â™ª

34:18.524 --> 34:20.389
- [screams]

34:20.492 --> 34:21.891
- Whoa!

34:21.994 --> 34:24.960
- â™ª

34:25.063 --> 34:26.763
- ALL: [laughter]

34:29.068 --> 34:31.201
- JUSTINA: The best part
of that was Chad's face.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.804
- Diandra, what made
you want to kiss Corey?

34:33.906 --> 34:36.473
The world wanna know.

34:36.574 --> 34:40.577
- So, you know, me
and Corey, um, like,

34:40.679 --> 34:43.246
when were on our way to the
beach--I think it was the day

34:43.348 --> 34:44.781
Nurys came or whatever--
You know,

34:44.882 --> 34:46.550
the three of us were having
conversations or whatever.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.284
And I was like, "You're dope."

34:48.387 --> 34:50.187
I was like, "[bleep],
you're kind of cute, whatever."

34:50.289 --> 34:52.656
Whatever.
And then we were just there,

34:52.757 --> 34:54.224
and I was just like, "You know,

34:54.326 --> 34:56.393
I've never been with
a white guy before."

34:56.495 --> 34:57.794
And then he was like, "Really?"

34:57.896 --> 34:59.896
I was like, "Are you
trying to be my first one?"

34:59.998 --> 35:02.599
And then he was like, "Yeah."
So we just started making out.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.101
- Why didn't y'all pursue it?

35:04.203 --> 35:07.504
- I was, like--I did want to
find love and things like that.

35:07.606 --> 35:11.775
But with Corey, we were just
so--like, such good friends.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.112
It wasn't--it wasn't
worth trying to, you know,

35:15.214 --> 35:17.481
pursue something
and, like, hopefully,

35:17.583 --> 35:19.216
that friendship could just,
like, get in--

35:19.318 --> 35:20.317
You know, like, end.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.552
So I was just like,
"That kiss was great."

35:22.654 --> 35:24.521
We did it again
in the confessional.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.957
And, yeah.
- Yeah, I mean, it's like, no.

35:27.059 --> 35:28.558
We were just having fun.
We were tight.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.461
- Now, are there any other
secret hook-ups

35:31.563 --> 35:33.096
that we don't know about?

35:33.198 --> 35:35.132
- Yeah, me and Cheyenne
made out a couple times.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.867
- Huh?
- You did?

35:36.969 --> 35:38.535
- I mean, look at him.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.770
- There was no
games left to play.

35:40.873 --> 35:42.539
- I was running around
the house, making friends.

35:42.641 --> 35:43.940
We were drunk, and we just--

35:44.042 --> 35:45.675
- Single and bored.
- Yeah.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.911
Murray didn't care.

35:48.013 --> 35:50.080
- Well, everyone
loves the cuddle.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.716
But no one loves it
more than Corey Brooks.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.117
Take a look!

35:54.219 --> 35:56.953
- Cozea, all day!

35:57.055 --> 35:58.221
You know what?

35:58.323 --> 35:59.656
I need some
cuddling sessions too.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.324
Let's do it, Jozea.
Hell yeah!

36:01.426 --> 36:03.727
- â™ª

36:03.829 --> 36:05.162
- Serious cuddling going on.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.599
- They're not cuddling.
They're spooning.

36:09.701 --> 36:12.636
And to my surprise,
Jozea is the big spoon.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.504
It's so cute.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.874
- [giggling]

36:17.976 --> 36:20.443
- This was the cuddle
that broke Twitter.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.879
Fans couldn't get
enough of you two.

36:22.981 --> 36:25.749
Jessica tweeted, "So, Corey,
what is it about Jozea

36:25.851 --> 36:27.884
that just makes him
the perfect cuddle buddy?"

36:27.986 --> 36:30.787
- I just--I didn't think
anything of it, you know?

36:30.889 --> 36:33.356
- I don't know what was going
on between you and Jozea.

36:33.458 --> 36:35.125
I know it was
a little weird or whatever.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.127
Whatever happened,
like, nothing happened.

36:37.229 --> 36:39.496
But it was just a little flirty,
and I don't know why.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.064
Like, it just turned
me off, like, really,

36:41.166 --> 36:43.433
like--I don't know.
And I was just, like, done.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.801
- He's comfortable
in his own skin.

36:44.903 --> 36:48.171
- I'm comfortable in my own
skin, personal found sexuality.

36:48.273 --> 36:52.742
You know, I feel like it should
be not weird for a straight guy

36:52.844 --> 36:55.378
to cuddle another dude.
I don't think anything of it.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.780
It could be anybody.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.816
Honestly, I don't care if you're
male, female, black, white,

36:59.918 --> 37:01.585
brunette, blonde, red hair.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.420
If you want to come
cuddle, we can cuddle.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.156
- I want to see what it's like
to cuddle a Corey.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.891
I like your motto:
Have fun and cuddle more.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.159
- That's right.

37:09.261 --> 37:11.661
- Let's go to a fan in
the audience with a question.

37:11.763 --> 37:12.996
Where's Casey?

37:13.098 --> 37:16.566
- Corey, who's the better
cuddler, Jozea or Sha?

37:16.668 --> 37:18.034
- Ooh!
- Oh!

37:18.136 --> 37:19.302
- You better answer that wisely.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.338
- [laughter]
- Hey, it's technique.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.340
Jozea's got it down, you know?
He's a good cuddler.

37:23.442 --> 37:26.243
- Well, you're not getting
any more cuddles, so...

37:26.345 --> 37:27.744
- What am I gonna do?
Oh, no!

37:27.846 --> 37:29.713
- [laughter]

37:29.815 --> 37:33.116
- Coming up, we'll take a trip
down memory lane and say goodbye

37:33.218 --> 37:35.518
to the relationships
that didn't last.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.254
Plus, the singles
and the exes

37:37.356 --> 37:40.223
will give us
their final thoughts.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.858
Right here, brother.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.660
The reunion.

37:43.762 --> 37:44.894
- [thunderclap]

37:46.531 --> 37:48.298
- â™ª

37:48.400 --> 37:50.500
- [cheers and applause]

37:50.602 --> 37:52.168
- Welcome back, baby.

37:52.271 --> 37:55.205
This season, some found love,

37:55.307 --> 37:57.707
some rekindled with an ex.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.843
But most just said [bleep] love.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.279
All good things
must come to an end.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.115
Here are the relationships
that some people on this stage

38:05.217 --> 38:07.050
wish they could forget.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.351
Take a look.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.354
- [wistful
instrumental music]

38:11.456 --> 38:17.460
â™ª

38:20.332 --> 38:23.099
- [laughs]

38:23.201 --> 38:24.968
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

38:27.239 --> 38:29.306
[laughter]

38:29.408 --> 38:33.443
- â™ª

38:33.545 --> 38:36.313
- AUDIENCE: Aww!

38:36.415 --> 38:41.284
- â™ª

38:41.386 --> 38:43.119
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

38:43.221 --> 38:49.225
- â™ª

38:57.235 --> 38:59.769
- JAY: Aww!

38:59.871 --> 39:01.905
- AUDIENCE: [laughter]

39:04.309 --> 39:10.213
- â™ª

39:10.315 --> 39:11.915
- Oh my god!

39:12.017 --> 39:14.517
- [laughter and applause]

39:14.619 --> 39:15.919
- Yes!

39:16.021 --> 39:17.387
- That would win any--

39:19.157 --> 39:20.890
- ALL: [laughing]

39:20.992 --> 39:22.392
- ROMEO: That's
a highly emotional song.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.227
- I love all of
you, mother [bleep].

39:24.329 --> 39:25.695
We had a great time.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.130
It was sick.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.965
- JUSTINA: Jozea?
- What?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.967
- You and Rob are both crying.

39:31.069 --> 39:32.736
- JOZEA: Well, y'all are
pulling at our heartstrings.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.871
That's still, like, a lot of
memories and stuff, you know?

39:34.973 --> 39:36.506
It's still beautiful to look at.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.007
- JUSTINA: Absolutely.
- But...

39:38.110 --> 39:40.076
- Regardless of what
went down in Malibu,

39:40.178 --> 39:42.379
everyone has something
to be thankful for.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.248
I want to open up the floor to
give everyone a chance to say

39:45.350 --> 39:47.617
any final thoughts
and any feelings

39:47.719 --> 39:49.052
they want to get
off their chest.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.154
- I just want to say that
this is an experience

39:51.256 --> 39:53.156
that we will never forget

39:53.258 --> 39:55.091
and that we all
share together

39:55.193 --> 39:56.793
for the rest of our lives.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.328
I'm just happy
to know all of you,

39:58.430 --> 40:00.764
and love every single one
of you guys.

40:00.866 --> 40:02.298
- Angela, got something?

40:02.401 --> 40:04.234
- Yeah, it took me two seasons,

40:04.336 --> 40:06.269
but I think
I finally got it right.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.772
A lot of tears,
a lot of fighting.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.741
I couldn't be happier,
the way I'm leaving the show.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.210
- Alright, and Farrah, you
always have words of wisdom.

40:14.312 --> 40:16.312
What you wanna leave out with?

40:16.415 --> 40:17.781
- I just depart everyone

40:17.883 --> 40:20.517
with this next chapter
in their life.

40:20.619 --> 40:21.751
And it's a really good one

40:21.853 --> 40:23.653
to leave this show
like this and move forth.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.755
And I'm excited
for everyone here.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.657
- Honestly, no matter
what happens in life,

40:27.759 --> 40:29.826
I think you grow
from every situation,

40:29.928 --> 40:31.828
no matter how good or how bad.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.963
And I see a lot
of growth tonight.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.265
Y'all keep living life.

40:35.367 --> 40:36.533
Find love, baby!

40:36.635 --> 40:38.668
I'm cupid!
I made this happen!

40:38.770 --> 40:39.869
I got something right!

40:39.971 --> 40:42.272
- [applause]

40:42.374 --> 40:44.240
- I love y'all.

40:44.342 --> 40:47.744
Big thanks to my co-host,
Justina, Miss Valentine--

40:47.846 --> 40:49.979
- You're damn right.
- --holding it down tonight.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.114
- Anytime, brother.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.982
- I'm Romeo.
Good night.

40:53.084 --> 40:56.352
- AUDIENCE:
[cheers and applause]

40:56.455 --> 40:58.555
- ANNOUNCER: Can you ever
truly get over your ex?

40:58.657 --> 41:01.391
Sure you can.
But it'll hurt like a "beach"!

41:01.493 --> 41:04.227
That's it for this season
of "Ex on the Beach."

41:04.329 --> 41:06.062
See you all "ex" time.
