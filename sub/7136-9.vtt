WEBVTT

01:46.800 --> 01:48.433
- Oz...

01:48.500 --> 01:49.767
the name on the street

01:49.834 --> 01:52.400
for the Oswald State
Correctional Facility,

01:52.467 --> 01:54.700
Level Four.

01:54.767 --> 01:57.633
Now, in Oz, our entire day
is structured.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.934
We know when we'll eat,
sleep, work,

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
when we'll have
free time.

02:02.066 --> 02:05.967
Now, giving a man who's
locked up free time is a joke,

02:06.033 --> 02:08.300
'cause there are still
all kinds of restrictions

02:08.367 --> 02:12.166
as to what you can
and cannot do.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.767
Some people try
to better themselves

02:13.834 --> 02:16.500
by reading or exercise.

02:16.567 --> 02:18.200
Some pray.

02:18.266 --> 02:20.233
Some plot.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.633
Some just watch TV.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.433
male announcer:
Live from Burbank Studios

02:24.500 --> 02:26.000
in Burbank, California,

02:26.066 --> 02:29.333
it's time to play
"Up Your Ante."

02:29.400 --> 02:32.166
And here's your host,
Gordon Elliott.

02:32.233 --> 02:35.533
- Hello, and welcome
to "Up Your Ante."

02:35.600 --> 02:37.700
And let's meet our first
contestant tonight,

02:37.767 --> 02:39.033
Mr. John Carpenter.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.500
- Hello.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.133
- Now let's meet our star.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.700
Joining us this evening,
the divine, the purr-fect

02:44.767 --> 02:46.233
Miss Eartha Kitt.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.567
Eartha, thank you so much
for being here.

02:48.633 --> 02:49.867
The category
is style and fashion.

02:49.934 --> 02:52.100
Take a look
at this photograph.

02:52.166 --> 02:56.600
Can you tell me what kind
of beard this man is wearing?

02:56.667 --> 02:58.100
- I think I need a hint.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.834
- Eartha?

02:59.900 --> 03:02.333
- Well, I can
give you a hint.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.300
It can also be called
a Rob Petrie.

03:05.367 --> 03:06.800
- Oh!

03:06.867 --> 03:08.133
- Rob Petrie?

03:08.200 --> 03:10.133
- It's a goatee,
you stupid fuck!

03:10.200 --> 03:12.300
- Come on, just say it.
Just say "goatee."

03:12.367 --> 03:14.500
- He could say "goatee,"
but he'd be wrong.

03:14.567 --> 03:15.734
- That's not a goatee?

03:15.800 --> 03:17.233
- It's a Van Dyke.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.033
- Van Dyke?

03:19.100 --> 03:21.600
- Rob Petrie?
Get it?

03:21.667 --> 03:23.567
- No.
Who's Rob Petrie?

03:23.633 --> 03:24.934
- Yo, would y'all just
fucking clam it up

03:25.000 --> 03:26.033
so I can hear the answer?

03:26.100 --> 03:27.333
- Count!

03:27.400 --> 03:28.467
- So it's either a Dick
or a Van Dyke...

03:30.433 --> 03:32.100
- What's the answer?
- Up my ante!

03:32.166 --> 03:35.467
- Yes, television
keeps us busy,

03:35.533 --> 03:37.233
keeps us happy.

03:38.400 --> 03:40.633
- I'm what we call
a segment producer.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.633
Each of our shows is divided
into four ten-minute stories,

03:43.700 --> 03:45.133
anchored by
a different newsman.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.533
I work
for Jack Eldridge.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.000
- Ah, I like Eldridge.

03:48.066 --> 03:49.200
He's a ball buster.

03:49.266 --> 03:50.600
That piece you did
on heating oil,

03:50.667 --> 03:52.567
he really tagged
that corporate clown.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.300
Have a seat.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.667
- We want to do
a three-part series on Oswald.

03:56.734 --> 04:00.367
You know, inside one
of America's toughest prisons.

04:00.433 --> 04:01.867
- No.

04:01.934 --> 04:03.100
- No?

04:03.166 --> 04:04.667
- Like I said, I saw
what he did to that guy,

04:04.734 --> 04:07.033
and I don't want to be
that guy.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.200
- What have you got to hide?

04:09.266 --> 04:11.433
- Nothing, but in the four years
since we had the riot,

04:11.500 --> 04:13.000
life around here's
been rough.

04:13.066 --> 04:15.433
Attitudes are just starting
to settle down.

04:15.500 --> 04:16.934
You bring in
the TV cameras,

04:17.000 --> 04:18.567
you're gonna stir
the situation up.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.000
- Well, I've spoken
to the commissioner,

04:21.066 --> 04:22.567
and he's agreed.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.533
- Then I'll call
the governor.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.200
- He also agreed.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.633
- Well, if you already
had permission,

04:32.700 --> 04:34.233
if you already knew
it was a done deal,

04:34.300 --> 04:35.533
why'd you even ask me?

04:35.600 --> 04:38.233
- To get
your honest reaction.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.066
First we're gonna do
an overview of life in Oswald.

04:43.133 --> 04:45.500
Then we're gonna follow
one new prisoner coming in,

04:45.567 --> 04:48.166
and we will close
with Jack Eldridge

04:48.233 --> 04:49.834
spending the night
locked in a cell.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.000
- Spending the night?

04:51.066 --> 04:53.200
- Yeah, just him
and one real inmate.

04:53.266 --> 04:54.400
- By the way,

04:54.467 --> 04:55.934
when does the great man
get here?

04:56.000 --> 04:57.533
- Not till the day
we actually shoot.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.700
For the next few days,
I'm gonna have a crew here

04:59.767 --> 05:01.633
while I do
preliminary interviews

05:01.700 --> 05:02.834
with you staff members

05:02.900 --> 05:04.467
and as many prisoners
as possible.

05:04.533 --> 05:05.834
Please understand,

05:05.900 --> 05:07.600
our goal is to show
the audience

05:07.667 --> 05:10.200
how incredibly difficult
your jobs are

05:10.266 --> 05:12.834
and to kick "60 Minutes"
in the ass.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.433
- That's all.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.100
Tomorrow
and for several days,

05:20.166 --> 05:22.166
a television crew
will be walking the halls,

05:22.233 --> 05:24.834
taping a piece on Oz
for their news magazine.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.000
Quiet down!

05:30.066 --> 05:31.567
Quiet!

05:33.133 --> 05:34.433
Now, I know,

05:34.500 --> 05:35.834
when the cameras
are rolling,

05:35.900 --> 05:38.266
you guys will run through
your bag of tricks:

05:38.333 --> 05:39.834
plead innocent,

05:39.900 --> 05:41.600
run scams, cry foul,

05:41.667 --> 05:44.567
or whatever else you think
is gonna get you some attention,

05:44.633 --> 05:47.333
get your faces on TV.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.000
But let me warn you.

05:49.066 --> 05:51.900
When those cameras
are gone,

05:51.967 --> 05:53.667
I'll still be here.

05:53.734 --> 05:57.166
When the story airs,
I will  be watching,

05:57.233 --> 06:01.367
and I won't forget what you say
or what you do.

06:01.433 --> 06:02.834
That is all.

06:02.900 --> 06:04.600
- Lights out!

06:15.166 --> 06:18.700
- I gotta think of some good
shit to tell this jamoke.

06:18.767 --> 06:20.433
He's only gonna use
the best stuff.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.967
- You gonna
make shit up?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.066
- Well, I can't tell him
the truth, can I?

06:24.133 --> 06:27.133
But I want to be on camera.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.633
Can't let these matinee idol
looks go to waste.

06:31.567 --> 06:32.834
- Callate.

06:32.900 --> 06:34.266
- Ay-yi-yi.
Callate.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.066
- Pendejo.

06:36.133 --> 06:38.300
- You gonna sit down
with those newspeople?

06:38.367 --> 06:40.367
- Yes, I am.

06:40.433 --> 06:44.033
I got a lot to say about
the conditions up in here.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.600
- Well, what if they ask
about Adebisi?

06:46.667 --> 06:49.033
- Adebisi.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.133
The court found me
innocent of his death

06:51.200 --> 06:54.467
by way of self-defense.

06:54.533 --> 06:57.867
Even McManus testified
on my behalf.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.934
- But still,
the reporters

07:00.000 --> 07:01.600
are bound
to dig up old bones

07:01.667 --> 07:03.734
and make us Muslims
look bad.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.033
- Arif, I am not afraid.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.800
- We gonna be on TV?

07:10.867 --> 07:12.633
- I am.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.433
But if you see a camera,

07:15.500 --> 07:17.300
you duck out of sight,
all right?

07:17.367 --> 07:18.500
- Why?

07:18.567 --> 07:21.100
- You don't remember
Jack Eldridge?

07:21.166 --> 07:22.133
- No.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.500
- Well, I do.

07:23.567 --> 07:25.367
He fucked us over, Cyril.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.233
He fucked us real bad.

07:27.300 --> 07:29.934
This might be our chance
to get even.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.934
Go to sleep.

07:38.934 --> 07:40.000
- Hey, girl!

07:53.600 --> 07:56.867
- Prisoner number 01W711,

07:56.934 --> 07:59.066
Omar White,

07:59.133 --> 08:03.500
convicted
January 4, 2001,

08:03.567 --> 08:06.500
murder in the first degree.

08:06.567 --> 08:10.166
Sentence: 75 years.

08:10.233 --> 08:13.100
Up for parole in 20.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.633
- Yo, that's what
I'm talking about.

08:15.700 --> 08:19.133
Check it out.
Look at the poontang nookie.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.667
- This is receiving
and discharge,

08:20.734 --> 08:22.667
where prisoners come in,
where prisoners go out,

08:22.734 --> 08:24.333
unless they're in
a body bag.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.066
- Okay, so which one
is Omar White?

08:26.133 --> 08:29.967
- White, Omar!

08:30.033 --> 08:31.934
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, come here.

08:34.166 --> 08:35.600
I'm Officer Murphy.

08:35.667 --> 08:37.600
This camera crew
has been authorized

08:37.667 --> 08:38.834
to follow you
on your first day.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.133
You got a problem
with that?

08:40.200 --> 08:42.834
- Oh, like, um--
like I'm gonna be on TV?

08:42.900 --> 08:44.400
- Yup.
- Heh.

08:44.467 --> 08:45.967
I ain't got
no problem with that.

08:46.033 --> 08:47.200
What, you and me, baby?

08:47.266 --> 08:48.633
- Easy, Omar.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.967
- Mr. White, you will be
serving 75 years for murder.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.266
Is that correct?

08:54.333 --> 08:56.934
- Look, I ain't even
know the bitch.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.100
I mean, why the fuck--
why would I shoot her?

08:59.166 --> 09:00.200
- Well, she was
the prime witness

09:00.266 --> 09:02.100
at your cousin's
murder trial.

09:02.166 --> 09:06.033
See, the mistake was not killing
that little girl too.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.834
- You think?

09:07.900 --> 09:09.033
Shit.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.667
I mean, shit.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.266
- Get back in line,
you mutt.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.900
- Who the fuck are you
calling mutt, huh?

09:14.967 --> 09:17.200
- Jake, Willard,
escort Mr. White back in line!

09:17.266 --> 09:19.800
- Who the fuck you talking--
- Get out of my face.

09:19.867 --> 09:21.633
- Hey, hey!
See what I'm saying?

09:21.700 --> 09:23.166
I'm gettin' hosed up in here
in this motherfucker.

09:23.233 --> 09:25.467
Get your hands off me,
motherfucker!

09:25.533 --> 09:27.467
Y'all don't know
who you're fucking with.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.433
- So...

09:29.500 --> 09:32.166
500 prisoners arrive each week?

09:32.233 --> 09:33.467
- Uh-huh.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.166
- And how many
are released?

09:35.233 --> 09:36.834
- Not enough.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.133
This is Emerald City,
also "Em City,"

09:40.200 --> 09:41.533
the experimental cell block

09:41.600 --> 09:43.867
started by Tim McManus
five years ago.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.900
In Em City,
the prisoners are given

09:45.967 --> 09:47.734
a lot more leeway
than the rest of Oz.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.400
- Hey, baby,
how about a little head?

09:50.467 --> 09:52.467
- Hey, Hoyt,
move along!

09:52.533 --> 09:54.567
Jesus.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.767
- Okay, the first one
I want to talk with

09:56.834 --> 09:58.800
is Tobias Beecher.

09:58.867 --> 10:02.133
- Um, all right,
this way.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.667
- Okay, Mr. Beecher,
the way this works

10:03.734 --> 10:06.734
is that you and I
are just gonna talk

10:06.800 --> 10:08.166
very informally, no pressure,

10:08.233 --> 10:09.734
and based
on our conversation,

10:09.800 --> 10:12.467
we'll decide if you get
interviewed by Jack Eldridge.

10:12.533 --> 10:14.333
- So the camera's
not on now?

10:14.400 --> 10:15.967
- No, yeah,
it's on.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.633
But we can turn it off
if you want.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.300
- I don't care.

10:19.367 --> 10:22.000
- Okay, you came
to Oswald in 1997

10:22.066 --> 10:23.333
as a result of a DUI

10:23.400 --> 10:25.266
and vehicular manslaughter
conviction.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.500
- Uh-huh.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.200
- Prior to that,
you were a successful lawyer

10:28.266 --> 10:30.967
from a prominent family
with a wife and two children.

10:31.033 --> 10:32.967
How has being in prison
changed you?

10:34.967 --> 10:36.734
- Well, describe
some of your experiences

10:36.800 --> 10:38.133
since coming
to Oswald.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.934
- Describe?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.767
Hmm...

10:41.834 --> 10:45.033
Ever read
the book of Job?

10:45.100 --> 10:46.333
- According to the file,

10:46.400 --> 10:47.867
at one point, you had
your arms and legs broken,

10:47.934 --> 10:49.667
and at another,
you were stabbed.

10:49.734 --> 10:50.800
- Yeah.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.967
You wanna see the scar?

10:53.033 --> 10:55.300
- You once tied
a fellow inmate down

10:55.367 --> 10:57.033
and defecated on his face.

10:58.467 --> 10:59.867
- Yeah.

10:59.934 --> 11:03.300
- Is that what it takes
to survive?

11:05.467 --> 11:08.700
- I'm not the man I was.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.834
Or maybe now I'm the man
I always was and never knew.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.100
- All these incidents
involved two other prisoners,

11:15.166 --> 11:17.300
Christopher Keller
and Vernon Schillinger.

11:17.367 --> 11:19.934
Tell me about your
relationship with them.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.433
- We sing in the choir
together.

11:31.367 --> 11:32.800
- What's going on?

11:32.867 --> 11:35.333
- Well, either he stole drugs,
or he owes for drugs.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.967
- So there are a lot
of drugs in Oswald?

11:50.033 --> 11:51.333
- Define "a lot."

11:51.400 --> 11:53.367
- Well, how many people
in this unit

11:53.433 --> 11:55.467
use heroin
on a regular basis?

11:55.533 --> 11:57.266
- I don't know.

11:57.333 --> 12:00.000
- One in two, one in three,
one in 20?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.166
- I don't know.

12:08.233 --> 12:11.100
- Okay, how about sex?

12:11.166 --> 12:12.934
- Is that an invitation?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.400
Right.

12:16.467 --> 12:18.767
Is there a lot
of homosexual activity?

12:18.834 --> 12:21.633
- Well, by homosexual,

12:21.700 --> 12:24.934
do you mean deep-rooted love
of one man for another

12:25.000 --> 12:27.033
or guys fucking guys
in the ass?

12:27.100 --> 12:28.600
- Ass fucking.

12:28.667 --> 12:30.333
- Shit happens.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.433
- And the authorities...
- Frown on it.

12:33.500 --> 12:36.166
But they do their darndest
to stop it.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.166
- As they do
on the drug taking.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.967
- Yes.

12:41.033 --> 12:43.600
- And have you?

12:43.667 --> 12:44.667
- What?

12:44.734 --> 12:46.567
- Fucked a guy
up the ass?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.400
Gotten fucked?

12:50.734 --> 12:54.633
- Well, if I had,
why would I say so to you?

12:54.700 --> 12:56.467
- Tobias Beecher.

12:58.433 --> 12:59.800
- What about him?

12:59.867 --> 13:02.333
- I don't know.
You tell me.

13:03.333 --> 13:06.567
- We sing in the choir
together.

13:13.900 --> 13:15.467
- That camera's
making me so nervous,

13:15.533 --> 13:16.767
I can't even shuffle.

13:16.834 --> 13:18.667
- Give me the cards.

13:22.166 --> 13:23.567
- Do I look okay?

13:23.633 --> 13:25.066
- You look like you.

13:25.133 --> 13:27.166
- Oh, shit.

13:27.233 --> 13:29.100
When I was on TV
after I escaped,

13:29.166 --> 13:30.467
I couldn't believe
how bad I looked.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.033
My skin was gray.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.800
- Gentlemen, I'm looking for
some background information

13:33.867 --> 13:37.000
on Tobias Beecher's relationship
with Vernon Schillinger--

13:37.066 --> 13:40.100
- Get the fuck
away from me!

13:40.166 --> 13:41.467
- Okay, relax, Busmalis.

13:41.533 --> 13:43.667
Come on, let's talk
to somebody else.

13:43.734 --> 13:45.000
Come on, Come on.
Come on. Let's go.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.834
- We'll go over there.
We'll go over there.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.467
- That's nice.

13:48.533 --> 13:52.500
Now all of America's gonna
see you acting like an asshole.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.300
- What do you want?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.667
- That news bitch was asking
an awful lot of questions.

14:08.734 --> 14:10.333
What did you
tell her about me?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.767
Get the fuck outta here.

14:15.166 --> 14:17.166
- You tell her
anything about us,

14:17.233 --> 14:19.967
you tell her anything
about anything...

14:20.033 --> 14:22.367
- And what, huh?

14:22.433 --> 14:23.633
What are you gonna do?

14:24.600 --> 14:26.200
- Shakedown!

14:29.233 --> 14:30.700
- Later.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.200
- Get up. Get your shirt up,
you asshole.

14:49.266 --> 14:51.433
- Get the fuck
outta here.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.467
- What do we have here?

15:03.533 --> 15:05.900
Come on, Brace,
I'm taking your ass to the Hole.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.133
- I think
I take drugs because...

15:14.200 --> 15:17.967
I know they're
destructive.

15:18.033 --> 15:19.500
I feel unworthy
of love.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.600
- Oh, Christ,
what a load of shit.

15:21.667 --> 15:22.867
- Tobias.

15:22.934 --> 15:24.767
- No, look at him being
all sincere and cuddly

15:24.834 --> 15:26.033
'cause of them.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.066
Keller's nothing
but a poser.

15:27.133 --> 15:28.300
- Shut the fuck up,
Beecher.

15:28.367 --> 15:29.533
- Yeah, shut up,
Beecher.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.767
You're spoiling this
for everybody, man.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.066
- Oh, yeah, O'Reily?

15:32.133 --> 15:34.100
Oh, right, you and Keller
are butt buddies now.

15:34.166 --> 15:35.734
Let me see,
when did that happen?

15:35.800 --> 15:36.934
When who died?

15:37.000 --> 15:38.166
- What you fuckin'
sayin', huh?

15:38.233 --> 15:39.333
- That's enough now.
Stop it!

15:39.400 --> 15:40.600
Turn that camera off.

15:40.667 --> 15:42.600
Turn it off
right now.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.600
Now!
Turn that light off.

15:44.667 --> 15:45.900
Off!

15:47.133 --> 15:50.433
- Tobias Beecher
and Christopher Keller.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.066
- What about them?

15:52.133 --> 15:55.934
- There's a lot
of bad blood.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.100
- There's a lot
of spilled blood.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.600
- Why?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.433
- The men in Oz
are very distressed--

16:02.500 --> 16:05.600
mentally, physically,
and morally.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.367
- Christopher Keller,
for example,

16:07.433 --> 16:08.800
is a sexual predator.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.800
So does that factor into
his problems with Beecher?

16:13.700 --> 16:17.333
- You know, I'm really
not comfortable

16:17.400 --> 16:20.600
specifically talking
about these cases.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.533
- Okay.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.567
Have you  ever
been harassed?

16:25.633 --> 16:26.934
Have you ever been
sexually threatened

16:27.000 --> 16:28.700
by one of the inmates?

16:28.767 --> 16:31.367
- No.

16:31.433 --> 16:32.934
No.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.133
- Hey, what are we
gonna do about Beecher?

16:39.200 --> 16:40.700
- Do?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.100
- You heard the guy
in rehab.

16:42.166 --> 16:43.333
The fucker almost goes public

16:43.400 --> 16:44.734
about us killing
Shemin and Browne?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.100
- He's playing around.

16:46.166 --> 16:47.767
He would have never
spilled all the beans.

16:47.834 --> 16:48.934
- Oh, you're sure
of this?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.066
- It's just his way of saying

16:50.133 --> 16:51.633
that he still loves me.

16:51.700 --> 16:54.066
- You know, the two of you
are just so fucked up, man.

16:54.133 --> 16:55.533
- Whoa.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.767
Don't you hurt Beecher,
O'Reily.

16:57.834 --> 16:59.533
You hurt Beecher,
I might have to hurt you.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.400
- Don't make any threats,
K-boy.

17:01.467 --> 17:03.533
Might put me
in a bad fucking mood.

17:08.900 --> 17:10.333
- Vern, check her.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.900
- She's not my type.

17:11.967 --> 17:13.300
- Your type?

17:13.367 --> 17:15.066
She got a pussy,
ain't she?

17:15.133 --> 17:17.867
- Yeah, and like you're gonna
get anywhere near her pussy.

17:17.934 --> 17:20.400
- Unit B is your
typical cell block.

17:20.467 --> 17:22.233
- And how many units
are built like this?

17:22.300 --> 17:23.567
- Uh, ten.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.333
Hey, Vern, you're up.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.133
- Him?
What about me?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.633
I give good story.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.767
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:30.834 --> 17:31.900
- Maybe later.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.700
- All right, this way.
Come on.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.000
- So you're
a white supremacist.

17:43.066 --> 17:46.800
- You people
in the media,

17:46.867 --> 17:49.467
you love to label us.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.266
I know, no matter
what I say here,

17:51.333 --> 17:55.300
you're gonna trim it
and make me look like a monster.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.433
But...
I'm no monster.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.734
I'm a widower

18:03.800 --> 18:07.767
whose first son
died tragically.

18:07.834 --> 18:10.800
I'm gonna be a grandpa.

18:10.867 --> 18:13.400
I believe in family,

18:13.467 --> 18:15.633
in America,

18:15.700 --> 18:17.734
in God.

18:20.233 --> 18:24.700
Does that sound evil
to you?

18:24.767 --> 18:27.533
- Now, your other son, Hank,

18:27.600 --> 18:31.433
has been accused of kidnapping
Tobias Beecher's children

18:31.500 --> 18:34.000
and of murdering
his son Gary.

18:34.066 --> 18:38.266
The FBI believes
you orchestrated the crime.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.033
That sounds
pretty evil to me.

18:43.867 --> 18:47.166
- Lady, you don't want
to be having opinions

18:47.233 --> 18:51.166
about things that you
could not possibly understand.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.166
- Oh, if I didn't know
you were such a fine,

18:53.233 --> 18:54.633
upstanding citizen,

18:54.700 --> 18:56.934
I might consider that
a threat.

18:59.967 --> 19:02.533
- Yo, I got
something to say.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.433
Schillinger's a pussy.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.934
Hey, sit down.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.734
- Shut your face,
nigger.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.333
- Hey, stop filming!
I gotta get you out of there.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.734
- Keep shooting! Keep shooting!
- Let's go. Move it!

19:16.800 --> 19:19.000
Let's go! Outta there!
- Keep shooting!

19:19.066 --> 19:21.033
- Move, move, move,
move, move.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.100
- Move it.
That's it.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.266
- So this Beecher story,
you think it has legs?

19:29.333 --> 19:30.533
- Oh, yeah.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.767
Usually the less
people are willing to say,

19:31.834 --> 19:32.834
the better the story.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.266
I just gotta
figure a way in.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.066
- Each prisoner is assigned
a number and photograph,

19:37.133 --> 19:40.033
and then they're sent
to their respective units.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.367
- And White's going
to Em City, right?

19:42.433 --> 19:43.967
- Yeah, God help us.

19:53.667 --> 19:56.333
Here you go.
Home, sweet home.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.834
Come on, let's go.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.767
- Yo.

20:11.834 --> 20:13.400
- What, you crippled
or something?

20:13.467 --> 20:15.266
- No, I'm physically
challenged.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.367
- Well, you got
any tits?

20:18.433 --> 20:19.734
- No.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.567
I don't do drugs
no more.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.667
- Well, you ain't no faggot
or nothing, huh?

20:23.734 --> 20:24.700
- No!

20:24.767 --> 20:28.300
- Well...

20:28.367 --> 20:30.700
thank God for that.

20:32.367 --> 20:35.467
Can't stand
no motherfucking faggots.

20:35.533 --> 20:36.934
Drive me crazy.

20:47.633 --> 20:48.800
- So what now?

20:48.867 --> 20:51.100
- It's nighty-night.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.333
- Lights out!

21:00.500 --> 21:02.433
- Hey.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.200
- The fourth estate
is gone?

21:04.266 --> 21:06.166
- Yeah, for today.
- Any problems?

21:06.233 --> 21:08.033
- Well, we had
a minor skirmish in Em City

21:08.100 --> 21:09.867
and a major battle
in Unit B.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.300
- They get everything
on tape?

21:11.367 --> 21:13.066
- Oh, yeah.
- Did our guys respond?

21:13.133 --> 21:14.867
- Both incidences
over in a flash.

21:14.934 --> 21:16.967
- You know, I don't care
if the prisoners look bad.

21:17.033 --> 21:18.467
I just don't want us to.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.834
- Well, she seems to be
mostly focusing on Beecher.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.266
- His is a cautionary tale.

21:23.333 --> 21:25.133
- Let's hope Logan
doesn't dig too deep.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.400
I wouldn't want her
uncovering any skeletons.

21:27.467 --> 21:28.667
- You mean Adebisi?

21:28.734 --> 21:30.633
- Among others.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.500
- Television is a medium
rarely well done.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.834
My Uncle Bilbo
said that.

21:35.900 --> 21:39.166
Okay, somebody said it first,

21:39.233 --> 21:42.567
but my Uncle Bilbo was
the first one to say it to me.

21:42.633 --> 21:45.100
Now, don't get me wrong,

21:45.166 --> 21:47.633
I love watching
the news on TV.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.266
Dan and Tom and Peter

21:49.333 --> 21:52.000
and maybe a little Jim Lehrer
if I'm feeling brainy.

21:52.066 --> 21:54.000
I flip back and forth
between news shows

21:54.066 --> 21:56.100
in hopes of catching
the same story,

21:56.166 --> 21:59.400
'cause each news show
tells a story a different way.

21:59.467 --> 22:04.033
ABC leaves out a fact
that CBS makes a big deal of.

22:04.100 --> 22:06.033
CBS interviews its expert,

22:06.100 --> 22:09.200
who totally disagrees
with NBC's expert.

22:09.266 --> 22:11.734
NBC goes in depth,

22:11.800 --> 22:15.800
while ABC gives the same story
five seconds' airtime.

22:15.867 --> 22:19.000
You see, I figure if I catch
all three versions,

22:19.066 --> 22:22.767
maybe combined, I get
a little taste of the truth.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.533
- Count!

22:41.133 --> 22:43.667
- 88P217.

22:43.734 --> 22:46.467
96J522.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.133
98A498.

22:50.834 --> 22:54.333
92M220.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.066
97A413.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.600
- Yo.
Yo, yo, dog, dog.

23:04.667 --> 23:06.633
Hook me up, baby.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.333
Come on, man,
don't be mean, man.

23:08.400 --> 23:09.734
Come on.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.767
Why you wanna
do me like that, dog?

23:19.667 --> 23:21.667
- Omar, my man.

23:21.734 --> 23:25.967
Jesus Christ, you're looking
a little crispy there, brother.

23:26.033 --> 23:27.233
- I gotta get
some tits.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.800
- Wow.

23:28.867 --> 23:30.934
You know, times
are lean right now.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.500
The hacks--

23:32.567 --> 23:35.200
they're doing too good a job
keeping that shit out of Oz.

23:35.266 --> 23:38.667
Trick is, you gotta know
the right person.

23:38.734 --> 23:40.000
You have a good day.

23:40.066 --> 23:43.333
- Yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo.

23:43.400 --> 23:46.400
Look, I been to
every nigga up in here.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.400
Look, man, they think--
they think I'm a narc, man.

23:48.467 --> 23:50.300
These motherfuckers, they don't
know me, man, I mean--

23:50.367 --> 23:53.033
- Hey, shh.

23:53.100 --> 23:56.033
Abracadabra.

24:01.467 --> 24:03.400
- Now what you want
in exchange for this?

24:03.467 --> 24:05.133
- Well...

24:05.200 --> 24:07.300
- I ain't gonna suck your dick
or nothing like that.

24:07.367 --> 24:09.900
- Hey, I'm no
fucking fag.

24:09.967 --> 24:11.333
I just might need you
to take care

24:11.400 --> 24:13.600
of a little business for me,
that's all.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.166
- I got no problem
with that.

24:16.233 --> 24:19.166
- Knock yourself out.

24:26.834 --> 24:28.133
- Hypocrisy.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.633
Hip-hoc-risy,

24:29.700 --> 24:31.133
that's what this is.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.734
See, they strip me
of my clothes,

24:32.800 --> 24:34.066
they strip me
of my rights,

24:34.133 --> 24:35.967
they strip me
of my self-respect,

24:36.033 --> 24:37.467
all 'cause they say
I broke the rules

24:37.533 --> 24:39.200
trafficking
in illegals.

24:39.266 --> 24:41.767
But they more guilty
than I could ever be.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.834
Fucking uppity-ups.

24:43.900 --> 24:48.133
See, they the ones that let
Adebisi sing and snort and suck.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.200
And when his blood ran out,
when his blood got spilled,

24:51.266 --> 24:55.266
the truth ran out
and the wall of lies got built.

24:55.333 --> 24:57.100
After Said greased him,

24:57.166 --> 25:00.033
fucking hacks act like
he ain't never even breathed in.

25:00.100 --> 25:02.533
And the lies got buried
with his number.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.900
- You saying there was
a cover-up?

25:03.967 --> 25:05.533
- Yeah, there was
a cover-up.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.934
Sheets and blankets,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.166
enough to cover up all them
high-and-mighties.

25:08.233 --> 25:09.433
- The warden too?

25:09.500 --> 25:10.667
- The warden
more than most!

25:10.734 --> 25:11.967
- All right, come on,
that's enough.

25:12.033 --> 25:13.066
- You see? You see?

25:13.133 --> 25:14.567
They're still trying
to shush me.

25:14.633 --> 25:16.166
- You got any evidence
to back up these accusations?

25:16.233 --> 25:17.200
- Yeah.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.400
There's a videotape.

25:19.467 --> 25:22.333
Adebisi, he documented
the whole drama,

25:22.400 --> 25:23.934
just like you doing
right here.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.233
You know what I'm saying?
Right up until the fade.

25:26.300 --> 25:28.700
You ask O'Reily,
you ask Said, you ask--

25:28.767 --> 25:30.400
- All right, shut up, Poet.
Come on, let's go.

25:30.467 --> 25:31.900
We gotta move on.
- No, he's got something to say.

25:31.967 --> 25:33.333
- He's always got
something to say.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.834
Come on, let's go.
- Hypocrisy!

25:34.900 --> 25:35.867
- Yeah, okay.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.700
- Conspiracy!
- Right.

25:37.767 --> 25:39.300
Take a nap.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.133
- Jack...

25:45.200 --> 25:48.100
I found our story.

25:48.166 --> 25:49.900
I'm not sure about
all the details yet,

25:49.967 --> 25:51.133
but something screwy happened

25:51.200 --> 25:54.000
surrounding the death
of an inmate.

25:54.066 --> 25:57.734
Yeah, and evidently
it's all on videotape.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.467
Well, the sooner
you get here, the better.

26:03.033 --> 26:04.266
Officer Murphy--

26:04.333 --> 26:05.400
- You ready?
You're gonna love death row.

26:05.467 --> 26:07.000
- Yeah, rather
than do that,

26:07.066 --> 26:09.700
I wanna go back and interview
a couple of prisoners again.

26:09.767 --> 26:11.367
- Okay.

26:11.433 --> 26:13.066
- And I'd like
to do so in private.

26:13.133 --> 26:14.667
- Private?
- Without you present.

26:14.734 --> 26:16.166
- That's not
gonna happen.

26:16.233 --> 26:17.467
- Don't worry.

26:17.533 --> 26:19.066
I'll get permission.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.200
- She asked to see
Said and O'Reily again?

26:26.266 --> 26:28.066
What's she want
with them?

26:28.133 --> 26:30.700
- Murphy thinks it might have
to do with Adebisi's death.

26:30.767 --> 26:33.000
- But O'Reily wasn't
involved with that.

26:33.066 --> 26:34.633
- I know.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.734
- I miss Mama.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.333
- So do I.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.400
- Why'd she have
to die, Ryan?

26:47.166 --> 26:49.567
I told you
a thousand times, Cyril,

26:49.633 --> 26:50.900
the cancer ate her up.

26:55.800 --> 26:58.266
Hey, Miss Sally's
on TV.

26:58.333 --> 27:00.200
Why don't you
go watch, okay?

27:00.266 --> 27:02.533
Please?

27:02.600 --> 27:04.767
- All right.
- Okay.

27:11.300 --> 27:12.867
How's it going, cuz?

27:12.934 --> 27:15.266
- I need some more tits.
- Whoa.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.667
I don't got
a never-ending supply,

27:16.734 --> 27:17.967
you know what I'm saying?

27:18.033 --> 27:19.467
- You know,
just a little bit, you know,

27:19.533 --> 27:20.800
just till I feel a little
better, you know what I mean?

27:20.867 --> 27:22.533
- You know, it's too bad
you got here when you did.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.133
Six months ago,

27:24.200 --> 27:26.900
we had tits coming out
of our fucking asses.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.467
When this guy Adebisi
ran the operation,

27:29.533 --> 27:31.500
the well never ran dry.

27:31.567 --> 27:32.767
- What happened to him?

27:32.834 --> 27:35.800
- He got shanked.
But that's not the point.

27:35.867 --> 27:37.633
When he died,

27:37.700 --> 27:41.300
the spics and the wops,
they took over everything.

27:41.367 --> 27:43.900
And between you, me,
and this sink,

27:43.967 --> 27:45.600
they're doing
a half-assed job.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.400
- How come brothers
don't organize?

27:47.467 --> 27:49.667
- They should.
They need a leader.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.900
I mean, right now, all they got
is this fool Poet.

27:51.967 --> 27:53.400
He's a complete come stain.

27:53.467 --> 27:55.400
- You know, I used
to run my block.

27:55.467 --> 27:56.734
- Well, there you go.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.500
Maybe you should
step up, huh?

27:59.567 --> 28:01.834
- Yeah.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.400
- Come here.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.667
Have some.

28:07.734 --> 28:09.300
- Shit yeah.

28:09.367 --> 28:12.133
- You see, to get anybody's
attention around this place,

28:12.200 --> 28:13.567
you gotta do
something large.

28:13.633 --> 28:14.900
- Large?

28:14.967 --> 28:17.000
- Yeah, like Adebisi,
he was large and in charge,

28:17.066 --> 28:19.266
bigger than life,
feared by one and all.

28:19.333 --> 28:21.233
- Yeah, well,
that's what I want.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.867
I want 'em to fear me.

28:23.934 --> 28:26.567
- Then you gotta
kill somebody.

28:26.633 --> 28:29.033
But not just anybody.

28:29.100 --> 28:32.133
You gotta go huge,
monumental,

28:32.200 --> 28:34.867
somebody...

28:34.934 --> 28:37.066
famous?

28:37.133 --> 28:38.834
- Like who?

28:38.900 --> 28:41.667
- All right, who's next?
Come on through, lady.

28:41.734 --> 28:43.533
Step over here.
Open your purse.

28:43.600 --> 28:44.600
Next!

28:46.066 --> 28:47.433
Put all metal objects
in there.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.767
And you're visiting...

28:48.834 --> 28:49.867
- Peter Thorpe.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.266
- Go through again.

28:54.333 --> 28:55.300
And your name is?

28:55.367 --> 28:56.333
- Helen Keating.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.066
- And the watch.

28:58.133 --> 28:59.333
- For Christ's sake,

28:59.400 --> 29:00.700
what do you think
I'm trying to smuggle in,

29:00.767 --> 29:02.033
a fucking bazooka?

29:02.100 --> 29:03.934
- Oh, Officer,
can you please...

29:04.000 --> 29:05.967
- Ah, Tom, listen, he's okay.
Let him in.

29:06.033 --> 29:07.834
- Oh, why didn't you say?

29:07.900 --> 29:10.233
I'm a big fan.

29:12.867 --> 29:13.800
- Good job.
- Yeah.

29:13.867 --> 29:16.333
Oi, oi!
Wake up.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.867
- Jack?
- Yeah?

29:22.934 --> 29:24.166
- This is
Ryan O'Reily.

29:24.233 --> 29:25.367
- Uh-huh.

29:25.433 --> 29:26.867
- Jack Eldridge.

29:26.934 --> 29:28.033
- Oh, how do
you do?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.500
- Hi. You don't
remember me, do you?

29:30.567 --> 29:31.633
- No, afraid not.

29:31.700 --> 29:32.700
Have we met?

29:32.767 --> 29:33.934
- Yeah, about 20 years ago.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.066
- Oh, well,
you'd understand, then.

29:36.133 --> 29:39.367
- Yeah, you must meet so many
people in this job, right?

29:39.433 --> 29:41.066
- What was
the circumstances?

29:41.133 --> 29:42.500
- It's not important.

29:42.567 --> 29:44.333
- Oh.
- Okay, Ryan.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.300
Comfortable?
- Yes.

29:49.433 --> 29:52.100
- And we are rolling.

29:53.767 --> 29:56.166
- Where were you
when Adebisi died?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.467
- The common room.

29:59.533 --> 30:01.400
- Any inkling as to what was
gonna happen to him?

30:01.467 --> 30:04.166
- No, no, as far as I could see,
Said and Adebisi,

30:04.233 --> 30:05.767
they were getting along
just fine.

30:05.834 --> 30:07.467
- Okay, so walk me
through this.

30:07.533 --> 30:08.500
You were in
the common room...

30:08.567 --> 30:09.967
- Doing nothing.

30:10.033 --> 30:12.133
- And?

30:12.200 --> 30:15.600
- I heard this noise
from Adebisi's pod,

30:15.667 --> 30:19.000
and he had these white curtains
hanging up in the room,

30:19.066 --> 30:20.166
and, poof,

30:20.233 --> 30:21.967
they just went red with blood

30:22.033 --> 30:23.233
everywhere, splattered,

30:23.300 --> 30:26.100
and then Adebisi,
he falls out of the pod,

30:26.166 --> 30:27.767
down on the ground, dead,

30:27.834 --> 30:29.767
and Said follows out

30:29.834 --> 30:32.467
with the shank
still in his hand.

30:32.533 --> 30:34.400
- Well, have you any idea
what led to the fight?

30:34.467 --> 30:37.934
- No.
- All right.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
You tell me there were curtains
on the windows of Adebisi's pod.

30:41.066 --> 30:42.467
Is that unusual?
- Yes.

30:42.533 --> 30:44.000
- Was Adebisi privileged?

30:44.066 --> 30:45.533
- Privileged?

30:45.600 --> 30:47.266
- Well, was he allowed
to get away with things

30:47.333 --> 30:48.600
the rest of you weren't?

30:52.500 --> 30:53.867
Hold on for a second.

30:53.934 --> 30:56.700
Excuse me.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.166
Wanna kill these things?

30:58.233 --> 31:00.700
- Sure.
Dale, guys, cut.

31:06.066 --> 31:07.200
What's the problem?

31:07.266 --> 31:08.500
- You want
that kind of knowledge,

31:08.567 --> 31:09.533
you're gonna have to pay.

31:09.600 --> 31:10.867
- Oh, we don't pay informers.

31:10.934 --> 31:12.467
- Then I'm not saying
another syllable.

31:12.533 --> 31:13.767
- Ryan, in the prescreen,

31:13.834 --> 31:15.700
you said that you would tell
everything you know.

31:15.767 --> 31:17.800
- Look, I tell,
it's gonna cost me.

31:17.867 --> 31:20.266
The warden's gonna be up my ass
like one of them proctoscopes.

31:20.333 --> 31:22.533
All I'm looking for here
is a little compensation.

31:22.600 --> 31:23.533
- No!

31:23.600 --> 31:25.200
Get the fuck out.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.767
- Suit yourself,
Mr. Eldridge.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.100
Pleasure
to see you again.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.700
- That bastard.

31:34.767 --> 31:38.066
Find out where the fuck
I know him from.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.333
- Mr. Eldridge,
how am I gonna do that?

31:39.400 --> 31:40.500
- Well, use your head!

31:40.567 --> 31:41.867
I certainly didn't
meet O'Reily

31:41.934 --> 31:44.467
at a cocktail party
on the Upper East Side.

31:44.533 --> 31:46.567
20 years ago.
I bet I did a story on him.

31:46.633 --> 31:48.133
Track it down!

31:48.200 --> 31:51.000
Commendable work, love.
Nice fucking interview.

31:55.066 --> 31:57.567
A pleasure
meeting you finally.

31:59.266 --> 32:00.934
I've admired you
for years.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.233
- Thank you.

32:02.300 --> 32:04.000
The feeling is mutual.

32:04.066 --> 32:05.633
- I've read
both your books.

32:05.700 --> 32:08.000
- Well, actually,
there are three.

32:08.066 --> 32:10.266
- You know, I've always felt
that your conviction was...

32:10.333 --> 32:11.800
politically motivated.

32:11.867 --> 32:13.066
- Gentlemen?
- What?

32:13.133 --> 32:15.233
- We're ready if you are.

32:16.567 --> 32:19.567
- Well, just relax.
Speak your mind.

32:27.433 --> 32:30.266
Minister Said,
you murdered Simon Adebisi.

32:32.300 --> 32:33.967
No, I, um...

32:34.033 --> 32:36.300
defended myself.

32:36.367 --> 32:38.133
He attacked me
with a knife.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.500
- Why? Why did
he attack you?

32:39.567 --> 32:42.266
- Well, I was under
the impression

32:42.333 --> 32:44.400
that we were gonna talk
about the conditions in Oz.

32:44.467 --> 32:45.567
- Well, isn't this
one of the conditions,

32:45.633 --> 32:47.133
brutality,
senseless violence?

32:47.200 --> 32:49.734
Was his attack on you
unmotivated?

32:49.800 --> 32:50.900
- No.

32:50.967 --> 32:52.467
- So you said something to him.

32:52.533 --> 32:54.033
You did something to him.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.500
- I am a Muslim.

32:55.567 --> 32:56.734
I did not agree
with some of the ways

32:56.800 --> 32:59.400
that Adebisi
was conducting himself.

32:59.467 --> 33:05.000
- Then why did you ask
to move into Adebisi's pod?

33:05.066 --> 33:07.633
You see,
I have here a form

33:07.700 --> 33:11.567
signed by you,
requesting the change.

33:11.633 --> 33:13.967
If you hated
Adebisi so much...

33:14.033 --> 33:15.100
- I didn't say
I hated him.

33:15.166 --> 33:16.500
- Then why live
with such an animal?

33:16.567 --> 33:17.800
- I was trying
to save him.

33:17.867 --> 33:20.667
- And yet instead
you killed him.

33:20.734 --> 33:23.700
What about the videotape
documenting Adebisi's conduct?

33:29.600 --> 33:32.400
- You know, right now,
I would like to move past

33:32.467 --> 33:34.667
this particular
conversation

33:34.734 --> 33:36.667
and speak about
the larger issues.

33:36.734 --> 33:38.400
- Do you deny
that there's a videotape?

33:38.467 --> 33:40.900
- Every day, we suffer

33:40.967 --> 33:43.233
fundamental civil rights
abuses.

33:43.300 --> 33:45.300
- The tape, sir,
yes or no?

33:48.467 --> 33:49.867
- I am done
talking with you.

33:49.934 --> 33:52.567
- Minister, we are only
trying to get the facts.

33:52.633 --> 33:55.700
- That part
of the story is over.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.533
Don't you understand?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.633
Adebisi is dead.

33:59.700 --> 34:01.200
Adebisi is irrelevant.

34:01.266 --> 34:02.367
- Nothing that brings about

34:02.433 --> 34:03.867
the death of a man
is irrelevant.

34:03.934 --> 34:06.233
You want us to hear
what you have to say, fine.

34:06.300 --> 34:08.800
You have to tell us
what we need to know first.

34:08.867 --> 34:11.133
- And then which part
will be aired?

34:14.900 --> 34:17.233
- They're definitely working
the angle on Adebisi.

34:18.633 --> 34:19.600
- His death?

34:19.667 --> 34:21.834
- Nope, what went on
before that.

34:21.900 --> 34:23.867
Poet told them
about the videotapes

34:23.934 --> 34:25.200
that Adebisi made.

34:25.266 --> 34:26.367
- Christ.

34:26.433 --> 34:27.467
- Yeah, and they're
trying to verify

34:27.533 --> 34:28.900
that the tapes exist.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.166
- Maybe we should
pull the plug.

34:30.233 --> 34:31.300
- I can't do that.

34:31.367 --> 34:32.400
I spoke to both
the commissioner

34:32.467 --> 34:33.734
and the governor,
and they feel

34:33.800 --> 34:36.367
if we back out now,
it'll only look worse.

34:36.433 --> 34:40.066
And since I never told either
of them about the videotapes,

34:40.133 --> 34:42.467
well, I sure as hell
can't tell them now.

34:42.533 --> 34:43.700
- Well, you may
have to, Leo.

34:43.767 --> 34:45.367
The truth may
have to come out.

34:53.700 --> 34:56.700
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:56.767 --> 34:59.433
- So you got
information for me?

34:59.500 --> 35:02.834
- I can't go on camera and say
the things that need to be said.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.333
- Why not?

35:04.400 --> 35:07.000
- Because it'll be
the end of Leo's career

35:07.066 --> 35:09.033
and the governor will
have enough ammunition

35:09.100 --> 35:11.400
to close down
Emerald City permanently.

35:11.467 --> 35:13.133
- Okay.

35:13.200 --> 35:16.633
So then what would you
be willing to say?

35:16.700 --> 35:18.734
- On camera, nothing.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.834
But as deep background...

35:25.567 --> 35:28.166
The guy you want to go after
is Martin Querns.

35:28.233 --> 35:31.433
- He ran Emerald City
after you.

35:33.533 --> 35:36.500
And what about
that videotape?

35:36.567 --> 35:38.266
Have you seen it?

35:38.333 --> 35:40.066
Has Glynn?

35:41.367 --> 35:45.767
Come on, talk to me.

35:46.734 --> 35:49.367
- What you're asking me to do
is betray a friend.

35:49.433 --> 35:51.200
- Friend?

35:51.266 --> 35:52.800
He fired you.

35:52.867 --> 35:55.567
- With good reason.

35:55.633 --> 35:57.633
And he gave me back
Em City.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.400
Like I said,
go after Querns.

36:06.367 --> 36:08.867
- Leo, what the fuck
is going on?

36:08.934 --> 36:10.533
I get a call asking me
if I'm willing

36:10.600 --> 36:13.033
to be interviewed
by Jack fucking Eldridge?

36:13.100 --> 36:14.266
- Well, they found out
what went on in Em City

36:14.333 --> 36:15.967
when you were
in charge.

36:16.033 --> 36:17.533
They heard about
the videotapes.

36:17.600 --> 36:18.734
- Fuck.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.467
When you asked me
to resign,

36:20.533 --> 36:21.900
you said no one would
ever know the reason,

36:21.967 --> 36:23.233
that we were gonna
keep it internal

36:23.300 --> 36:24.834
so that neither one of us
would get hurt.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.367
- Refuse to do
the interview. I did.

36:27.433 --> 36:29.200
- Fine.

36:30.867 --> 36:32.500
Where are
the videotapes?

36:32.567 --> 36:33.767
- In a safe place.

36:33.834 --> 36:35.400
- What are you
keeping them around for?

36:35.467 --> 36:36.967
Destroy the tapes, Leo.

36:37.033 --> 36:40.333
Destroy the goddamn
motherfucking tapes now!

37:03.834 --> 37:05.500
- Warden.

37:05.567 --> 37:07.033
- Mr. Eldridge.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.233
- So I understand
you've canceled our interview.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.000
- That's right.

37:11.066 --> 37:12.100
- May I ask why?

37:12.166 --> 37:13.900
- You can ask.
I won't answer.

37:13.967 --> 37:15.667
- Come on,
off the record.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.567
Between two guys
holding their dicks.

37:17.633 --> 37:19.300
- I was thinking of running
for lieutenant governor.

37:19.367 --> 37:21.900
I spent too much time
in front of the camera.

37:21.967 --> 37:23.467
- Between you and me,
off the record...

37:23.533 --> 37:25.400
That's bullshit.

37:28.533 --> 37:30.533
You've spent how many years
at Oswald?

37:30.600 --> 37:31.734
- Too many.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.233
- Yet it would bother you
to leave, right?

37:34.300 --> 37:36.000
To quit?

37:36.066 --> 37:39.533
To be forced out
because of some indiscretion,

37:39.600 --> 37:43.633
because some mishandling
of the job was exposed on TV?

37:48.133 --> 37:51.667
- I've spent my entire life
punishing people,

37:51.734 --> 37:54.000
and over the years,
I've had to make choices.

37:54.066 --> 37:57.367
Some were good,
and some led to violence.

37:57.433 --> 38:01.600
Lives have been lost,
and I wonder,

38:01.667 --> 38:03.600
could I have stopped
the carnage?

38:06.467 --> 38:08.800
- Simon Adebisi...

38:08.867 --> 38:10.567
could you have
prevented his death?

38:16.233 --> 38:17.400
- Yes.

38:17.467 --> 38:21.767
Balls-out truth,
I should be fired.

38:21.834 --> 38:24.000
But I'm afraid whoever
they bring in to replace me

38:24.066 --> 38:26.367
would only be worse.

38:26.433 --> 38:28.834
It's a terrible thing
to reach this point

38:28.900 --> 38:33.700
and realize your whole life
has been a sham.

38:33.767 --> 38:36.033
- So for a man whose job
is meant to punish others,

38:36.100 --> 38:38.800
you ultimately punish yourself
more than anyone.

38:38.867 --> 38:40.500
- Off the record?

38:40.567 --> 38:42.433
- Yes.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.300
- No comment.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.333
- Lisa.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.400
- What?

39:03.467 --> 39:06.100
- The Adebisi story,
it's a dead end.

39:06.166 --> 39:08.100
- What?
Jack, no.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.633
- My instincts tell me
that none of the principles

39:09.700 --> 39:11.066
are gonna come forward
with the facts.

39:11.133 --> 39:13.233
- Well, we've faced tougher
resistance than this before.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.700
I can get McManus
to crack.

39:14.767 --> 39:16.633
- There are people who do things
for malicious reasons.

39:16.700 --> 39:17.800
This prison
is full of them.

39:17.867 --> 39:19.433
I don't think
Leo Glynn is one.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.533
He's imperfect,
but he's not incompetent.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.600
- That is no reason not
to expose what happened here.

39:23.667 --> 39:24.900
A man died.

39:24.967 --> 39:26.333
- Yeah, from all appearances,
a bad man.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.867
- Oh, you're making
judgments now?

39:27.934 --> 39:29.567
What, Simon Adebisi's life is
not as important as the pope's?

39:29.633 --> 39:31.300
- Don't get
high and mighty with me.

39:31.367 --> 39:32.900
I've brought presidents,
serial killers,

39:32.967 --> 39:34.500
corporate giants
to their knees.

39:34.567 --> 39:36.066
- And now's not the time
to go soft.

39:36.133 --> 39:37.900
- I'm going home.

39:37.967 --> 39:39.567
Big day tomorrow.

39:39.633 --> 39:41.333
- You're making a mistake,
Jack.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.900
Letting this story go
is a fucking mistake!

39:43.967 --> 39:47.600
- Yeah, probably, but, you know,
every once in a while,

39:47.667 --> 39:50.266
even a newsman
has to have a heart.

39:50.333 --> 39:52.700
- Hey, can I have your
autograph, Mr. Brokaw?

39:57.700 --> 39:58.934
What a dick.

40:04.266 --> 40:06.867
- Journalists are supposed
to be impartial.

40:06.934 --> 40:10.867
They're supposed to keep their
personal opinions to themselves.

40:10.934 --> 40:14.767
However, on TV, we know
what the reporter is feeling.

40:14.834 --> 40:17.367
We see Sam Donaldson
or Andrea Mitchell

40:17.433 --> 40:19.000
giving us the facts,

40:19.066 --> 40:21.100
but with the camera
that close up,

40:21.166 --> 40:24.233
we can also tell
by a raised eyebrow,

40:24.300 --> 40:26.500
a tiny inflection

40:26.567 --> 40:28.266
what they really think
about the person

40:28.333 --> 40:30.033
who they're
reporting on.

40:30.100 --> 40:34.333
Now, Walter Cronkite,
he had the poker face.

40:34.400 --> 40:37.133
Nobody ever knew
what old Walt was thinking.

40:37.200 --> 40:39.166
So while he was
telling the truth,

40:39.233 --> 40:41.367
he was also lying
to the camera.

40:41.433 --> 40:43.867
That's genius!

40:43.934 --> 40:46.800
- Yo, yo, yo, O'Reily,
O'Reily, my man.

40:46.867 --> 40:48.533
Yo, I forgot
to thank you, man,

40:48.600 --> 40:50.266
for getting me put down
in this cafeteria, man.

40:50.333 --> 40:51.433
This shit is dope.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.133
- Oh, hey,
no problem, cuz.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.400
Hey, come here.
Come here. Come here.

40:54.467 --> 40:55.600
I got a little
something for you.

40:55.667 --> 40:58.367
Hey, little morning
pick-me-up.

40:58.433 --> 41:00.667
We call it a duster.
Yeah.

41:00.734 --> 41:03.633
So, Omar, I hear
you're the lucky fuck

41:03.700 --> 41:07.433
who's gonna spend the night
in the cell with Jack Eldridge.

41:07.500 --> 41:09.266
- I'm gonna be
a TV star, shit, like...

41:09.333 --> 41:11.467
like Martin Lawrence

41:11.533 --> 41:13.367
or Bart Simpson
and shit.

41:13.433 --> 41:15.367
- This shit is good, man.

41:15.433 --> 41:16.934
- Have some more.
Have some more.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.433
You know, I just hope he doesn't
disrespect you, that's all.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.367
- Dis me?
How he gonna dis me?

41:21.433 --> 41:24.367
- Well, I overheard him
telling somebody yesterday

41:24.433 --> 41:25.734
that you were a faggot.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.967
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that's what he said.

41:29.667 --> 41:30.800
- Faggot?
- Yeah.

41:30.867 --> 41:32.133
- I ain't
no motherfucking faggot!

41:32.200 --> 41:34.433
- Well, no, hey.
Omar, Omar, Omar, hey.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.867
I know that.

41:35.934 --> 41:37.800
But, you know,
them news media cocks,

41:37.867 --> 41:39.667
they love
to twist shit around.

41:39.734 --> 41:41.667
You know, they don't
give a fuck about the truth.

41:41.734 --> 41:44.433
They make a guy look the way
they want him to look

41:44.500 --> 41:46.533
for the sake of their story,
to boost the ratings.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.100
You know what I'm saying?
- Ratings?

41:48.166 --> 41:50.033
Fuck the motherfucking
ratings.

41:50.100 --> 41:52.000
This motherfucker ain't
calling me no faggot!

41:52.066 --> 41:53.467
- But the funny thing is,

41:53.533 --> 41:56.800
is the tabloids say that
Eldridge is actually a faggot.

41:56.867 --> 41:58.333
- I heard that somewhere.
I know.

41:58.400 --> 42:01.000
- Yeah, he's like one of them
closet cases, you know?

42:01.066 --> 42:03.367
But to cover up
his shame,

42:03.433 --> 42:06.166
he's gonna skunk you
on national television.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.700
- No.

42:07.767 --> 42:09.300
- Hey, O'Reily.
- Huh?

42:09.367 --> 42:10.867
- Those eggs ain't
gonna fry themselves.

42:10.934 --> 42:11.967
- I'm coming.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.200
- Okay, let's go, man.

42:13.266 --> 42:16.000
- I'm coming.
I'm coming.

42:16.066 --> 42:17.767
Hey, if I were you,

42:17.834 --> 42:20.800
tonight when I was alone
with that cocksucker,

42:20.867 --> 42:23.800
I'd teach him a thing or two
about being a real man.

42:23.867 --> 42:25.500
Enjoy that.

42:31.900 --> 42:33.633
- Hello, hello.

42:33.700 --> 42:35.200
- Mr. Eldridge.
- Hey, Jack.

42:36.934 --> 42:38.233
- Hello, Lisa.

42:39.500 --> 42:40.800
- Jack.

42:40.867 --> 42:43.433
- What did you find out
about Ryan O'Reily?

42:43.500 --> 42:46.100
- When he was 16, you did
a piece on urban gangs,

42:46.166 --> 42:47.700
about how the black kids
were taking over

42:47.767 --> 42:49.834
the turf of the whites,
especially the Irish.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.700
- I interviewed O'Reily?
- Yeah.

42:51.767 --> 42:54.133
And his brother, Cyril.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.633
Here are
the transcripts.

42:56.700 --> 42:57.834
Lisa.

42:57.900 --> 42:59.300
- I don't have time
to read that.

42:59.367 --> 43:01.066
Did Jack make
O'Reily look bad?

43:01.133 --> 43:04.266
- I reviewed the tape
last night, and yeah...

43:04.333 --> 43:07.467
the O'Reilys came off
as being brutal, heartless.

43:07.533 --> 43:09.333
- I want to see
that tape.

43:10.767 --> 43:12.633
- Let's go.
Come on in.

43:17.600 --> 43:19.133
Watch the paint.

43:24.233 --> 43:26.533
At 5:00, all the prisoners
are locked down in their cells.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.967
9:00, lights out.

43:28.033 --> 43:29.300
- Until...

43:29.367 --> 43:30.867
- 6:00 a.m.

43:30.934 --> 43:33.400
- Oh, mamacita, querida.

43:33.467 --> 43:35.000
- Keep it in
your pants, Guerra.

43:35.066 --> 43:37.367
Let's go.
Keep a-moving.

43:37.433 --> 43:38.934
Jesus.

43:41.900 --> 43:43.400
- There he is.

43:43.467 --> 43:44.667
- There's the fuck.

43:44.734 --> 43:45.900
- Omar, just chill out
till tonight.

43:45.967 --> 43:47.400
- No, no, no,
that bitch is mine.

43:47.467 --> 43:48.934
- No, Omar.
Hey, Omar!

43:49.000 --> 43:49.934
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.100
- Get the fuck off me.

43:51.166 --> 43:52.900
Hey, hey, hey!

43:52.967 --> 43:54.467
Hey, you!

43:54.533 --> 43:56.567
You fuck.

43:56.633 --> 43:57.800
You fuck.

43:57.867 --> 43:58.967
- What's your problem,
White?

43:59.033 --> 44:00.467
- I got your punk
for you, all right?

44:00.533 --> 44:02.200
- White, what's your problem?
- What's my problem, huh?

44:02.266 --> 44:03.667
- Calm down.
- He's my problem!

44:03.734 --> 44:04.900
You know what else? I got
another problem too, all right?

44:04.967 --> 44:06.300
This!

44:06.367 --> 44:07.800
This is
my fucking problem!

44:07.867 --> 44:09.233
Hey. Hey, hey.

44:09.300 --> 44:11.633
- Hey, hey, hey, relax, man.
Relax.

44:11.700 --> 44:13.300
Calm down, White.
Let's go.

44:13.367 --> 44:15.100
- Hey!
- Fuck!

44:15.166 --> 44:16.433
He's got a knife!

44:16.500 --> 44:19.567
- Come on, get 'em up!
Come on!

44:19.633 --> 44:21.200
- Central, this is 11.
We got a 66.

44:21.266 --> 44:22.500
Lockdown!

44:22.567 --> 44:23.900
- Come on, Mineo,
you guinea fuck,

44:23.967 --> 44:25.200
you want some more?

44:25.266 --> 44:26.734
- Put down the shank!
- Come on!

44:26.800 --> 44:28.133
- Put down the shank!

44:28.200 --> 44:30.567
- Come on,
you fucking bitch!

44:30.633 --> 44:32.400
Come on,
I'll fuck you up!

44:42.033 --> 44:43.266
Motherfuckers!

44:43.333 --> 44:44.734
Motherfuckers!

44:44.800 --> 44:47.266
Motherfuckers!
Motherfuckers!

44:47.333 --> 44:49.834
- God damn it.

44:49.900 --> 44:51.467
- Motherfuckers!

44:51.533 --> 44:54.133
- This is exactly
why I didn't want you here

44:54.200 --> 44:55.600
in the first place.

44:55.667 --> 44:57.834
I think, at the very least,
you ought to postpone.

44:57.900 --> 45:00.700
- No, by postpone,
you mean never reschedule.

45:00.767 --> 45:03.033
- Our concern is for
your safety, Mr. Eldridge.

45:03.100 --> 45:04.633
- I've been in this game
a long time.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.000
I can take care
of myself.

45:06.066 --> 45:07.367
- So we're gonna go ahead
with it tonight?

45:07.433 --> 45:08.433
You're gonna sleep in a cell?

45:08.500 --> 45:09.900
- Yes, but of course,

45:09.967 --> 45:12.333
now we have to find someone else
to match up with Jack.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.066
- Well, we could put you
in a cell alone.

45:15.133 --> 45:16.500
- Ted Koppel did that
on "Nightline."

45:16.567 --> 45:17.834
It was complete
horse shit.

45:17.900 --> 45:19.300
- Then who?

45:19.367 --> 45:21.166
- I've been reading the files
on the O'Reily brothers.

45:21.233 --> 45:23.667
The younger one, Cyril,

45:23.734 --> 45:25.033
he's now brain damaged

45:25.100 --> 45:27.767
and under medication
to control his actions.

45:27.834 --> 45:29.166
I choose him.

45:29.233 --> 45:31.800
- I don't want my brother
involved with this, okay?

45:31.867 --> 45:32.834
I refuse.

45:32.900 --> 45:34.233
- O'Reily,
I don't have a choice.

45:34.300 --> 45:35.467
You don't have a choice.

45:35.533 --> 45:36.567
Let's just try to make it
through the night

45:36.633 --> 45:38.233
and pray for the best.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.133
- You know what?
You pray.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.066
Say a whole
fucking rosary.

45:47.300 --> 45:48.700
- You tested the camera?

45:48.767 --> 45:49.800
- Twice.
We're good to go.

45:49.867 --> 45:50.900
- All right.

45:52.133 --> 45:53.367
Lock me up.

45:53.433 --> 45:55.233
- I wish you'd let
the SORT team be here.

45:55.300 --> 45:58.967
- No, I want this to be like
any other typical night.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.533
- Here we go.

46:42.734 --> 46:43.934
- Hello, Cyril.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.333
I'm Jack Eldridge.

46:46.400 --> 46:48.000
- Hello.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.467
- Jack, you ready?

46:58.000 --> 46:59.033
- You're on.

47:01.367 --> 47:03.233
- It's 5:00 p.m.,
and already--

47:06.300 --> 47:07.567
It's only 5:00 pm,

47:07.633 --> 47:08.734
but the prisoners
of Emerald City

47:08.800 --> 47:10.667
are already in lockdown
for the night.

47:10.734 --> 47:13.300
Two to a cell with nothing
but a pair of beds,

47:13.367 --> 47:15.533
a sink,
and a toilet.

47:15.600 --> 47:18.734
The room is about the size of
the average American bathroom,

47:18.800 --> 47:20.467
and it smells
like one as well.

47:20.533 --> 47:23.967
Imagine, if you can,
spending the rest of your life

47:24.033 --> 47:27.867
locked up with a complete
stranger in your bathroom.

47:27.934 --> 47:29.600
- Who you talking to?

47:31.200 --> 47:33.900
- Well, that camera,
which I want you to ignore.

47:38.166 --> 47:41.433
So this evening, here we are
at Oswald Penitentiary.

47:41.500 --> 47:43.133
- Jack, you gotta
move to your left.

47:43.200 --> 47:44.233
You're blocking him.

47:44.300 --> 47:45.834
Oh, that's good.

47:45.900 --> 47:47.533
- What do you do
before lights out?

47:47.600 --> 47:49.200
- Wait.

47:49.266 --> 47:51.834
- For what?

47:51.900 --> 47:53.967
- The lights to go out.

47:55.300 --> 47:57.400
- Um...here.

47:58.367 --> 48:00.633
Yeah, that's it.

48:00.700 --> 48:01.800
And then?

48:04.000 --> 48:05.433
- Um...

48:05.500 --> 48:08.867
I say my prayers
and sleep.

48:08.934 --> 48:11.900
- Oh.
- Hmm.

48:11.967 --> 48:14.233
- And what
do you pray for?

48:16.133 --> 48:20.567
- Oh, I pray to Jesus...

48:20.633 --> 48:24.900
that Ryan will be safe
and Aunt Brenda

48:24.967 --> 48:28.300
and my daddy
will smile...

48:28.367 --> 48:31.066
and they'll take care
of my mama in heaven.

48:31.133 --> 48:32.867
- Your mother died?

48:32.934 --> 48:35.500
- Years ago
in the hospital.

48:35.567 --> 48:37.967
I hate hospitals.

48:38.033 --> 48:40.133
- Here.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.400
- I hate the smell
of hospitals.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.934
I mean, the medicine
tastes bad.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.500
- Yeah.

48:48.567 --> 48:51.200
- Ryan tells me
to take my medicine,

48:51.266 --> 48:54.333
but I don't sometimes.

48:54.400 --> 48:55.600
Like today.

49:12.133 --> 49:15.000
- Ah.

49:15.066 --> 49:16.533
What about, um...

49:16.600 --> 49:19.000
before the accident?

49:19.066 --> 49:21.633
Do you remember
anything about that?

49:21.700 --> 49:25.667
- There are flashes
once in a while...

49:25.734 --> 49:28.233
like now.

49:28.300 --> 49:31.934
I see you...

49:32.000 --> 49:36.100
and I think
maybe I know you.

49:38.467 --> 49:40.500
- We met many years ago.

49:40.567 --> 49:42.033
You were 15.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.233
You, your brother, and I,

49:47.300 --> 49:49.100
we talked about
your lives in the gang.

49:55.133 --> 49:57.767
- You made Mama sad.

49:57.834 --> 49:59.633
You made Mama cry.

49:59.700 --> 50:02.633
You gave
my mama cancer.

50:04.900 --> 50:07.700
- Holy shit!

50:07.767 --> 50:09.967
- Central, this is 11.
We got a 66.

50:10.033 --> 50:13.400
- Ryan said at the grave
that you gave my mother cancer.

50:17.166 --> 50:20.333
- Cyril!

50:20.400 --> 50:22.266
Cyril!

50:22.333 --> 50:24.900
- You gave my mama cancer!

50:24.967 --> 50:29.533
- Cyril!
Cyril!

50:29.600 --> 50:32.433
- You gave
my mama cancer!

50:32.500 --> 50:34.867
- Cyril!

50:34.934 --> 50:36.333
Cyril!

50:37.433 --> 50:38.834
Cyril!

50:38.900 --> 50:41.266
- Mama!

50:43.166 --> 50:45.300
Ryan!

50:45.367 --> 50:46.867
- Cyril!

50:47.834 --> 50:48.767
- Jack!

50:48.834 --> 50:51.200
Jack! Jack!
- Ryan!

50:51.266 --> 50:52.567
- Oh, Jack.

50:52.633 --> 50:54.700
- Oh, did you--
Lisa, did you...

50:54.767 --> 50:55.834
- What? Did I what?

50:55.900 --> 50:57.900
- Get it all on tape?

51:01.166 --> 51:05.133
- Television has the power
to enlighten, to inform,

51:05.200 --> 51:08.867
to lay the bare truth
before the eyes of the public.

51:08.934 --> 51:11.667
Television
is an extraordinary gift,

51:11.734 --> 51:15.133
as much a miracle
from God as Lazarus

51:15.200 --> 51:18.867
rising from the dead.

51:18.934 --> 51:22.066
But do we use
the gift wisely?

51:22.133 --> 51:24.033
Have we ever?

51:24.100 --> 51:25.467
- News anchor Jack Eldridge

51:25.533 --> 51:27.300
became a part
of his own story yesterday

51:27.367 --> 51:29.934
as what many industry insiders
called a ratings stunt

51:30.000 --> 51:31.333
backfired.

51:31.400 --> 51:32.967
Convicted murderer
Cyril O'Reily

51:33.033 --> 51:35.400
brutally beat Eldridge,
causing the veteran reporter

51:35.467 --> 51:37.033
to suffer
a severe concussion,

51:37.100 --> 51:39.266
four broken ribs,
and a punctured lung.

51:39.333 --> 51:42.200
He remains at Benchley Memorial
in critical condition.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.667
Despite the objections
of Eldridge's producer,

51:44.734 --> 51:46.433
Lisa Logan,
the network has decided

51:46.500 --> 51:48.200
not to air
what was intended to be

51:48.266 --> 51:50.367
a three-part series
on life inside

51:50.433 --> 51:52.633
Oswald's maximum
security prison.

51:52.700 --> 51:55.166
The Emmy and Peabody
Award-winning Logan

51:55.233 --> 51:57.233
resigned in protest.

51:57.300 --> 52:00.400
We all wish Jack
a speedy recovery.
