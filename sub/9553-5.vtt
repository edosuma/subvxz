08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
Uh, Cunningham, you want
to get back where you were?

08:48.440 --> 08:49.950
Three kinds of pretzels?

08:49.950 --> 08:51.950
I understand that,
but you can't have a party here

08:51.950 --> 08:53.650
with an expectant mother.

08:53.650 --> 08:55.480
Why not? She said she didn't
want to be any trouble.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.570
Because the party's gonna keep
her up all night, that's why.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.570
You know
that Danny is my oldest friend.

08:59.570 --> 09:02.460
He was on the back of my bike
when I got my first ticket.

09:02.460 --> 09:04.040
Okay.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.050
I'm gonna go over to Arnold's
and stay out real late.

09:07.050 --> 09:08.500
Cunningham?
Ooh!

09:08.500 --> 09:10.550
Listen, I don't
think you understand.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.000
You've got to stay
here with Louisa.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.970
You mean, in case
of an emergency?

09:14.970 --> 09:17.140
No, in case she
wants to mambo.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.510
I knew that, but I thought
you were gonna stay with her.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.090
Me?
Yeah, Fonz.

09:22.090 --> 09:23.100
You remember?

09:23.100 --> 09:25.600
You know, you and Danny,
best friends,

09:25.600 --> 09:27.150
ticket on the motorcycle.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.230
All that's true.
All that's true.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.740
But let me tell
you something.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.820
The thing is, I got one of
my A plus evenings planned.

09:32.820 --> 09:37.410
Oh. Well, I-I don't know
how to say this, Fonz, but, uh,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.410
I don't think
that's very fair.

09:39.410 --> 09:41.500
Not fair, huh?

09:41.500 --> 09:45.030
Well, don't let it be said
that I am not a man of justice.

09:45.030 --> 09:46.620
Great, I'll see you
later, Fonz.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.120
Cunningham, you want

09:48.120 --> 09:50.120
to get back right
here where you were?

09:50.120 --> 09:52.090
This is what we're
gonna do, Red.

09:52.090 --> 09:54.130
We're gonna tell each
other about our evenings,

09:54.130 --> 09:57.630
and the one with the more
interesting evening leaves.

09:57.630 --> 10:02.550
I have a date with
the Aloha Pussycats.

10:02.550 --> 10:05.390
They're that-that dancing group
at the Hawaiian Room,

10:05.390 --> 10:06.440
aren't they?
That's right.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.770
Which one are you going out
with?

10:07.770 --> 10:08.640
All of 'em.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.560
Well, that's not a bad evening.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.650
Hey, for a Monday, for a Monday.

10:14.650 --> 10:16.480
And you, sir?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.070
Well, see, uh,

10:18.570 --> 10:20.570
I was thinking that
I'd go over to Arnold's...

10:20.570 --> 10:22.070
Oh, yeah.

10:22.070 --> 10:23.570
And I'd-I'd meet Ralph
and Potsie there.

10:23.570 --> 10:24.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:25.070 --> 10:26.080
And, uh, we'd look around

10:26.080 --> 10:28.040
for some chicks,
you know what I mean?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.580
Right, right.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.660
(laughs):
And Potsie'd talk about
his appendix scar.

10:31.660 --> 10:33.080
He still does that,
huh?
Yeah.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.670
And, uh... And-And Ralph
would tell some

10:34.670 --> 10:36.000
of his moron jokes.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.920
And we'd order some French fries
or something, you know...

10:40.920 --> 10:42.560
I guess I'll stay.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.140
See ya.

10:44.140 --> 10:45.430
Look out, girls.

10:45.430 --> 10:46.510
Put on your grass skirts.

10:46.510 --> 10:49.020
The Fonz is coming along
with a lawnmower.

10:49.020 --> 10:51.400

10:58.940 --> 11:00.530

it's getting late.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.030
I should get
the baby to bed.

11:02.030 --> 11:04.030
Oh, uh, here,
let me help you.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.030
No, that's all
right, I got it.

11:06.030 --> 11:07.030
Uh, there. Thank you.

11:07.030 --> 11:10.840
Listen, um, how come you get
stuck with me every night?

11:11.040 --> 11:13.120
Oh, well, it's
not stuck, no.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.620
It's lots of fun.

11:15.010 --> 11:17.430
Oh. Three nights in a row?

11:17.710 --> 11:19.300
Come on.

11:19.300 --> 11:22.300
I thought Fonzie was
supposed to stay with me.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.300
Well, normally, he would,
he would, except that,

11:24.300 --> 11:29.310
well, he's entertaining some
special friends from Hawaii.

11:29.310 --> 11:30.770
He'll probably
be in late.

11:30.770 --> 11:34.310
Oh. Well, thank you
for staying with me.

11:34.310 --> 11:35.310
Oh, that's
all right.

11:35.310 --> 11:38.310
You know, Richie,
you really are very nice.

11:38.310 --> 11:40.320
Good night.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.320
Nice.

11:47.320 --> 11:49.330
Mr. Nice.

11:50.830 --> 11:53.330
I'll probably be voted
the nicest kid in my class.

11:54.830 --> 11:57.330
I'll wind up
on the All-Star Nice Team.

11:57.330 --> 12:01.340
Pat Boone, Kate Smith,
Captain Kangaroo and me.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.310
I'm talking to a stuffed doll.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.840
Man, I got
to get off that team.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.350
(knocking)

12:10.350 --> 12:11.650
RALPH:
Open up, Rich, quick!

12:11.850 --> 12:13.430
Well, it's stuck.
You got to push!

12:13.430 --> 12:14.930
RALPH:
Okay. One, two.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.940
POTSIE:
Don't push me, Ralph!

12:16.940 --> 12:17.820
RALPH:
Three!

12:18.100 --> 12:19.690
(grunts)

12:19.690 --> 12:20.690
Good work, Pots.

12:20.690 --> 12:23.190
A guy can get killed
coming into this place.

12:23.190 --> 12:24.190
I didn't invite you.

12:24.690 --> 12:27.660
Maybe so, but boy, are you
going to be glad we're here.

12:27.660 --> 12:28.700
Rich, we just
picked up

12:29.200 --> 12:30.200
some chicks
at Arnold's.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.200
It was easy.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.200
They didn't know us.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.710
Look, I'm
stuck here,

12:36.710 --> 12:38.210
so I don't want to hear
anything about chicks.

12:38.210 --> 12:39.710
I'm not listening,
you see?

12:40.210 --> 12:40.710
What's with you?

12:41.210 --> 12:43.210
(humming
"Camptown Races")

12:43.210 --> 12:47.220

from the Lake Gamefish Contest.

she had in competition.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.000
I can't leave

13:54.000 --> 13:55.920
Bring it along;
we'll hang it from the mirror.

13:57.340 --> 13:59.840
Not the doll.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.090
Louisa.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.170
Oh, no, no,
don't bring Louisa.

do with Miss Trout?

14:14.850 --> 14:17.860

she's too good to throw back.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.430
Is it the way I'm dressed?

14:58.850 --> 15:00.400
Cunningham, I can't talk to
you when you're like this.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.430
Will you just put 'em up,
Fonz, huh? Just put 'em up.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.440
Now, let me ask
you a question.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.440
Is this a bad joke
or just a good shot

15:05.440 --> 15:07.860
at suicide?

15:07.860 --> 15:09.440
You made me spend the whole
night with an expecting mother

15:09.440 --> 15:11.940

a date with a trout.

15:11.940 --> 15:13.610

yourself, huh?

15:13.610 --> 15:15.200

not until you tell me

15:15.200 --> 15:17.000
why you want to go out
with a fish.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.080
Potsie and Ralph picked
up on some chicks.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.950
They probably
didn't know 'em.
They didn't.

15:20.950 --> 15:23.040
Aaayyh!

15:23.040 --> 15:24.620
All right, all right,
you know, you used to be

15:24.620 --> 15:25.620
such a nice kid.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.630
Oh, nice kid, huh?
Yeah.

15:27.630 --> 15:29.630
All right,
Fonz, that's it.

15:29.630 --> 15:32.100
Put 'em up,
you, you nerd.

15:35.550 --> 15:37.050
Nerd?

15:37.050 --> 15:38.470
Aaayyh.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.560
(Louisa moans)

15:39.560 --> 15:42.560
Ah, come on,
I didn't even hit you.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.560
I didn't say
that, Fonz.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.560
Oh, all right.

15:45.560 --> 15:46.560
(Louisa moaning)

15:46.560 --> 15:47.700
Get ready, boys!

15:47.700 --> 15:50.450
It's time!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.530
Fonz.
Yeah?

15:51.530 --> 15:53.320
I think she's going
to have her baby.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.900
All right, all right.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.410
We're just going
to be cool.

15:56.410 --> 15:57.410
Right, right,
I'm cool.

15:57.410 --> 15:58.410
We're going
to stay cool.
Yeah.

15:58.410 --> 16:00.410
All right,
this is a time for cool.

16:00.410 --> 16:01.910
Right.
We're going to listen
to our instincts.

16:01.910 --> 16:02.910
Listen to your
instincts, Fonz.

16:02.910 --> 16:04.910
I'm listening
to my instincts.

16:04.910 --> 16:07.420
All right, all right.

16:12.420 --> 16:14.420
All right, now just
tear this into strips.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.420
I'm going to
boil water.

16:15.420 --> 16:16.680
Right, Fonz.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.760
Oh, Fonz?
Yeah?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.510
Why are we doing this?
Because someone told me--

16:19.510 --> 16:22.600
uh, uh, Shortcake-- just
before she started her vacation.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.100
Shortcake?
The kid.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.100
BOTH:
Bad idea.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.100
We need some medical books.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.100
Medical books.
Yeah.

16:28.100 --> 16:30.610
Aaayyh, medical books,
all right.

16:30.610 --> 16:33.610
Here we go-- hardware,
hardware, hardware.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.610
Where are your father's
medical books?

16:35.110 --> 16:36.610
He's in hardware.
I forgot.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.610
Yeah, all right.

16:38.610 --> 16:40.120
Oh, Mom likes these over here.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.120
Boys...
I could use a little help.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.620
Yeah, artificial
respiration.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.500
Uh, no,
that's for drowning.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.790
Well, let's put her
in some water.

16:46.790 --> 16:48.870
Yeah right-- no, no,
let's get her a doctor.

16:48.870 --> 16:49.880
I-I already
called the doctor.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.880
The doctor's going to
meet me at the hospital.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.050
So would somebody
please go get my bag?

16:54.050 --> 16:55.130
Good idea.
Richie, get her bag.

16:55.130 --> 16:56.130
You see how easy
this is going to be?

16:56.130 --> 16:59.130
We just have to get her
from here to the hospital.

16:59.130 --> 17:00.640
I'm going to start my bike.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.600
Fonz, why are you starting
your bike?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.390
No reason.
I'm gonna
go get the bag.

17:04.390 --> 17:05.470
Good.

17:05.470 --> 17:06.480
You know, this is
unfair, Louisa.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.980
You said two weeks,
you said two weeks.

17:07.980 --> 17:08.980
Well, tell him.

17:08.980 --> 17:11.480
You said two weeks,
you said two weeks.

17:11.480 --> 17:12.480
Whoop! Aah!

17:12.480 --> 17:13.819
Richie.

17:13.819 --> 17:15.400
(indistinct chatter)

17:15.400 --> 17:16.400
Oh, that door's
stuck, Fonz.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.200
Aaayyh.

17:22.490 --> 17:24.490
Richie, Richie,
it's stuck!

17:24.490 --> 17:25.490
Yeah, right.

17:25.490 --> 17:27.000
Yeah, the window-- we'll
shove her through the window.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.630
Let's go through the window,
right.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.220
Fonz.
Yeah.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.970
The kitchen
door works.
I knew that.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.550
Let's go.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.060
Calm, very calm.

17:36.060 --> 17:37.560
It opened.
It worked.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.560
It opened.
Yeah.

17:38.560 --> 17:42.010
It opened.

17:42.010 --> 17:43.060
You got to keep up.

17:43.060 --> 17:44.060
Will you keep up?

17:44.060 --> 17:47.100
You got to keep up!

17:50.440 --> 17:51.520
FONZIE:
This way, this way.

17:51.520 --> 17:53.520
One step at a time,
you're doing fine.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.520
You see that?
You're doing fine.

17:55.520 --> 17:59.530
Hey, Fonz, maybe one of us
should have driven.

17:59.530 --> 18:00.530
Don't you
understand?

18:00.530 --> 18:01.530
Don't you
understand

18:01.530 --> 18:03.530
she needed that for
confidence, huh?

18:03.530 --> 18:05.030
Hey, listen, Richie,
put her in this.

18:05.030 --> 18:07.540
Right.
I'll take care of this.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.540
Nurse, we need a nurse!

18:09.540 --> 18:10.540
Nurse,
we need a nurse!

18:10.540 --> 18:11.540
Shh...

18:11.540 --> 18:13.540
I almost forgot, I forgot
we were in a hospital, I forgot.

18:13.540 --> 18:14.540
Yeah, so shh.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.930
Here, now
put this on.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.440
Are we in a loony bin
or the emergency room?

18:24.440 --> 18:26.220
No, this is the emergency room.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.310
Oh, good.
Hey, don't you work

18:27.310 --> 18:28.940
at Spic 'N Span Cleaners?

18:28.940 --> 18:32.730
Yeah, I'm Kitty,
I do volunteer work here.

18:32.730 --> 18:34.310
Listen, we're here because
we got a baby that's about--

18:34.310 --> 18:36.950
I mean, we got a lady
that's about to have a baby.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.820
Oh, you picked a bad night.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.990
Yeah, see, Nurse Millie Nash
is retiring tonight--

18:44.990 --> 18:46.490
40 years on the job.

18:46.490 --> 18:48.210
She's such a sweet person.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.290
Yeah, well, I
got to tell you--

18:49.290 --> 18:50.300
we got a sweet
person here

18:50.300 --> 18:52.500
that in a minute is going
to become two sweet people.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.630
How far apart
are the contractions?

18:54.630 --> 18:56.050
Five minutes.
Five minutes.

18:56.050 --> 18:58.140
Five minutes?
You got a lot of time.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.170
Relax, join the fun--
have a horn.

19:00.170 --> 19:02.260
Look, you don't
understand, ma'am.

19:02.260 --> 19:03.730
Will you
give me that?

19:03.730 --> 19:04.760
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:04.760 --> 19:05.760
She said there was no rush.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.430
I don't normally do
things like that.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.310
It's time, it's time.

19:09.310 --> 19:10.900
But you just said there
was a lot of time.

19:10.900 --> 19:11.900
No, it's time for the party.
Quiet down.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.400
Here, here,
you should have a hat.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.400
You definitely got
to have a hat.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.490
Take one, give them out,
give them out.

19:16.490 --> 19:17.490
Get ready, duck.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.490
Hide, everybody,
hide, hide, hide, hide.

19:19.490 --> 19:20.490
Get down, get down.

19:20.490 --> 19:22.490
Okay, okay, okay.

19:22.490 --> 19:23.500
Ready, ready?

19:23.500 --> 19:24.950
Here she comes.

19:26.420 --> 19:28.920
Why is it so dark?

19:28.920 --> 19:31.120
You can't have a hospital
in the dark.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.670
Surprise!

19:47.550 --> 19:48.550
What did you get me?

19:48.550 --> 19:50.940
Something
really terrific.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.530
Thank you,
I love it.

19:53.530 --> 19:55.030
Hey, hey, hey,

19:55.030 --> 19:56.400
No, no, Millie.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.980
No, we got you a watch.

19:58.980 --> 19:59.980
Oh, who needs a watch?

20:00.480 --> 20:02.400
I need new teeth.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.150

All right, you take care of her.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.240
You get her room.

20:09.740 --> 20:10.740
The doctors--
will you take off your hats

20:10.740 --> 20:12.240
and be like a hospital?

20:12.240 --> 20:13.880
Will you come on?
Let's move it.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.960
Everybody, move it. There
is a baby coming here.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.970
There is a baby coming here.

20:17.970 --> 20:19.550
The man's right,
the man's right.

20:19.550 --> 20:20.550
Go back to work.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.550
All right, listen,
the party will continue--

20:22.550 --> 20:25.060
the party will continue
when the baby is delivered.

20:25.060 --> 20:28.010
Now, <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">that is the way
a hospital should be run{\r}.</font></font></i>

20:33.570 --> 20:35.570
Well, here we are.

20:35.570 --> 20:38.070
Since we're waiting for
this blessed event to occur,

20:38.070 --> 20:40.070
I figure we could discuss
your behavior

20:40.070 --> 20:42.070
earlier this evening,
Cunningham.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.530
You were pretty feisty.

20:43.530 --> 20:44.610
Oh, yeah.

20:45.110 --> 20:46.530
Yeah, I was
pretty tough, huh?

20:46.530 --> 20:48.110
Well, you'd be a lot tougher
without the hat,

20:48.110 --> 20:51.120
let me tell you.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.620
I believe the word
you used was "nerd."

20:55.620 --> 20:56.620
Right.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.620
Right, that was
pretty rotten.

20:58.620 --> 21:01.960
Calling the Fonz a nerd
is not nice.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.550
You see, Fonz, I'm
trying not to be

21:03.550 --> 21:05.050
such a nice guy
all the time.

21:05.050 --> 21:06.550
You know what I mean?

21:06.550 --> 21:09.050
It's my new image.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.550
Oh, I forgot to put money
in the meter.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.020
Oh, don't worry,
I'll get it.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.610
Hey, you see that?
I fooled you, I fooled you.

21:15.610 --> 21:16.560
You're a nice guy.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.610
You're stuck with it.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.610
I guess so.
Yeah.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.610
Why do you think I let you
hang around with me?

21:22.610 --> 21:24.620
Well, I-I didn't mean to
call you a nerd, Fonz.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.120
Hey, I know that,
I know that.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.620
Just don't let it happen
again, all right?

21:28.620 --> 21:30.620
Listen, you know,
I shouldn't have made you

21:30.620 --> 21:32.620
stay around with Louisa
all the time either.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.630
A guy's got a right to do
whatever he wants to do,

21:35.630 --> 21:37.000
even if it is dull.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.330
Hi, boys.

21:40.330 --> 21:41.830
This is Louisa's baby.

21:41.830 --> 21:43.840
Oh... what is it?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.840
It's a fine healthy boy.

21:45.840 --> 21:48.340
Aaayyh,
look at that.

21:48.340 --> 21:50.840
Yeah, what else do you think
Danny would have?

21:50.840 --> 21:52.840
I was just on my way
to the nursery

21:52.840 --> 21:55.150
and I thought you might like
to have a little peek.

21:55.150 --> 21:56.570
Oh.

21:56.570 --> 21:58.730
(chuckling):
Oh, cute little shrimp.

21:58.730 --> 21:59.740
How are you?

22:01.690 --> 22:04.270
You look pink.

22:04.270 --> 22:05.270
I tell you something.

22:05.270 --> 22:06.270
Listen, your father
would have been here,

22:06.270 --> 22:07.780
you understand,
but he's on the road.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.280
He's going to be
so proud of you.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.750
Oh, whoa.

22:10.750 --> 22:12.750
Listen, you know, if he was
here, he'd give you advice.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.370
(coos)

22:14.370 --> 22:15.450
What?

22:15.450 --> 22:19.960
Oh, uh, well, you know,
he'd kind of go like, um,

22:19.960 --> 22:21.960
"It's a tough world.

22:21.960 --> 22:23.460
"You want to be cool,

22:23.460 --> 22:24.960
"you don't do nothing
to nobody

22:24.960 --> 22:26.960
that you don't want them
to do to you, huh?"

22:26.960 --> 22:27.800
