INTO AN AQUARIUM!

19:44.182 --> 19:45.601
STOP YELLING AT ME!

19:45.684 --> 19:47.936
IT'S THE SQUID'S FAULT.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.730
ME? I DIDN'T KNOW.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.647
I WAS JUST...

19:50.731 --> 19:51.899
I DON'T CARE WHOSE FAULT.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.358

HEY, GUYS, DAD'S HOME.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.282

20:02.075 --> 20:03.535
I'LL KEEP DAD BUSY.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.830
HEY, POPS, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HOME?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.707
REMEMBER THE OLD RHYME:

20:08.790 --> 20:13.086
{\an1}WHEN STIMPLETON'S AWAY,
I WILL USE HIS POOL.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.839
HEY, KIDDO, DO ME A FAVOR.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.133
GRAB MY OLD SURF TRUNKS

20:59.007 --> 21:01.760
REMINDS ME
OF MY OLD POOL-HOPPING DAYS.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.262
I'VE NEVER HEARD
ABOUT YOUR POOL-HOPPING DAYS.

21:04.346 --> 21:08.058

21:18.151 --> 21:19.695
BANNED FOR LIFE.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.406
NEVER DID LET ME BACK
IN THAT HOTEL.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.158
YOU SURE WERE RADICAL, POP.

21:25.242 --> 21:29.079
"WERE"? YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.205
WAIT UP, DAD.

21:30.288 --> 21:32.374
HOW ABOUT
ANOTHER STORY?

HUH?

21:43.844 --> 21:45.762
HEY, UH, DAD...

21:45.846 --> 21:48.098
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO SHOWER OFF

21:48.181 --> 21:49.599
BEFORE YOU DIVE IN.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.226
IT'S STIMPLETON'S RULE.

21:51.309 --> 21:52.102
LIGHTEN UP, REG.

21:52.185 --> 21:54.730
STIMPLETON'S A MILLION
