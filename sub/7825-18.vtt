Wow!

00:57.050 --> 00:58.010
( <i>sighing )</i>

01:00.790 --> 01:02.060
I knew it.

01:02.120 --> 01:03.490
And here it is.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.260
We're going to take a test.

01:05.330 --> 01:07.170
Oh!

01:07.230 --> 01:09.470
We're going to take a test.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.570
All right! A test!

01:11.630 --> 01:15.260
It's called the Career Aptitude
Normalizing Test--

01:15.340 --> 01:16.570
or "CAN'T."

01:16.640 --> 01:18.180
Some of you may discover

01:18.240 --> 01:20.310
a wonderful vocation
you never even imagined.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.510
Others may find out
life isn't fair.

01:22.580 --> 01:25.320
In spite of your masters
from Bryn Mawr

01:25.380 --> 01:28.920
you might end up a glorified
baby-sitter to a bunch of
dead-eyed fourth graders

01:28.980 --> 01:30.350
while your husband
runs naked on a beach

01:30.420 --> 01:31.820

01:34.660 --> 01:36.230
( <i>clears throat )</i>

01:36.290 --> 01:37.600
First question--

01:37.660 --> 01:39.830
"If I could be any animal,
I would be:

01:39.900 --> 01:42.030
"a) a carpenter ant

Question 60--

"I prefer the smell of:

01:54.210 --> 01:56.210
or, c) bank customers."

01:57.810 --> 02:00.210
Well, that was
a waste of time.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.940
Janie, school is never
a waste of time.

02:03.020 --> 02:04.960
Since we have 15 minutes
until recess

02:05.020 --> 02:06.520
please put down your pencils

02:55.870 --> 02:56.940
Mm-hmm.

All right!

03:06.350 --> 03:08.050
Homemaker?

03:08.120 --> 03:09.720
Mm-hmm. Just like a mommy.

03:09.790 --> 03:10.820
Police officer?!

03:10.890 --> 03:12.620
Well, I'll be jiggered.

03:12.690 --> 03:14.990
<i>If you'd like
to learn more</i>

03:15.060 --> 03:16.430
I could arrange
for you

03:16.490 --> 03:18.330
to ride along
in a police car
for a night.

03:18.390 --> 03:20.860
Hey! I don't need <i>you
to get me in the back of
a police car.</i>

03:20.930 --> 03:22.370
I really think you should
consider this.

03:22.430 --> 03:25.970
Before I saw these test results,
I had you pegged as a drifter.

03:26.030 --> 03:28.700
Wow. A drifter.

03:28.770 --> 03:30.440
Lousy sheriff.

03:30.510 --> 03:32.580
Run <i>me out of town.</i>

Cool.

Lisa:

03:39.650 --> 03:41.820
I might as well be dead.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.080
Lisa, it's not <i>that bad.</i>

03:43.150 --> 03:44.390
What are you gonna be, boy?

03:44.450 --> 03:45.450
Policeman.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.460
( <i>choking )</i>

03:47.520 --> 03:48.950
Oh, that's nice, Bart.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.190
Your father
wanted to be a policeman
for a little while

03:51.260 --> 03:53.600
but they said
he was too heavy.

03:53.660 --> 03:55.860
No, the Army said
I was too heavy.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.340
The police said
I was too dumb.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.270
Well, I'm going to be
a famous jazz musician.

03:59.330 --> 04:00.700
I've got it all figured out:

04:00.770 --> 04:03.210
I'll be unappreciated
in my own country

04:03.270 --> 04:06.240
but my gutsy blues stylings
will electrify the French.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.650
I'll avoid the
horrors of drug abuse

04:07.710 --> 04:10.150
but I <i>do plan to have
several torrid love affairs</i>

04:10.210 --> 04:11.320
and I may or may not die young.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.150
I haven't decided.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.519
Honey, if that's what you want,
we'll do anything we can
to help.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.890
Wait a minute.

<i>Can you tell me
if I have what it takes</i>

04:31.530 --> 04:33.060
to be a blues musician?

04:33.140 --> 04:35.540
Sure can.
Show me your chops.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.700

04:39.780 --> 04:41.380
Uh-huh.

04:44.180 --> 04:45.050
Yeah.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.130
Cool.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.830
So, you think
she has talent?

04:55.890 --> 04:57.130
Sure.

04:57.190 --> 04:59.690
Do you think she could be
a professional someday?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.030
Oh, Lord, no.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.130
But I'll practice every day.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.470
I'll be frank
with you, Lisa

05:04.530 --> 05:06.590
and when I say frank,
I mean devastating.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.210
You've inherited
a finger condition

05:08.270 --> 05:09.240
known as stubbiness.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.100
It usually comes

05:10.170 --> 05:11.140
<i>from the father's side.</i>

05:12.880 --> 05:14.180
D-ohh!

05:14.240 --> 05:15.670
Stupid fingers.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.740
You're wrong! You're wrong!

05:17.810 --> 05:19.510
You don't need long fingers
to play the blues.

05:19.580 --> 05:23.190
The blues come from in here.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.120
My God, they <i>are stubby.</i>

05:26.920 --> 05:28.130

05:28.190 --> 05:30.030
Look, I didn't steal
that copper wire.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.400
I just thought
they were throwing it out.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.600
Here. Take it.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.500
No. We're here
for your son.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.290
He's coming
on a ride-along.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.870
Good for you. Maybe this
will straighten the boy out.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.730
Wow! Can I see your club?

05:43.810 --> 05:44.980
It's called a baton,
son.

05:45.040 --> 05:45.880
What's it for?

05:45.940 --> 05:47.080
We club people with it.

Well! It's about time.

you know
you've made a difference.

Hey Bart, you see
that Caddie over there?

06:05.230 --> 06:06.300

That's Mayor
Quimby's car.

Tonight his honor is...
...polling the electorate.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.410
It doesn't quite
work that way, son.

07:17.700 --> 07:20.640
Whoo. They used
nylon rope this time.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.930
It feels so smooth
against my skin--

almost sensuous.

Until then, son

you're down on homemaking

but it can really
let you be creative.

09:24.910 --> 09:28.120
See? This morning
I turned bacon, eggs, and toast

09:28.180 --> 09:29.780
into a nice smiley face
for Bart and Homer.

09:29.850 --> 09:31.920

They'll never notice.

You've been most cooperative.

you blame the dog

at band practice?

I quit.

10:19.060 --> 10:20.890
Honey, right now
you're discouraged

you love the saxophone.

why don't <i>you join the band?</i>

what you can't do

but they don't always know
what they're talking about.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.290
You know what
I want to be
when I grow up?

on the oatmeal box?

10:42.790 --> 10:44.460

Women can't be astronauts.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.000
Why not?

10:50.060 --> 10:51.300
They distract the
men astronauts

10:51.360 --> 10:53.290
so they wouldn't keep
their minds on the road.

10:53.370 --> 10:55.640
There will too be
women astronauts.

10:55.700 --> 10:57.410
( <i>laughing )</i>

10:57.470 --> 10:58.410
It's true

10:58.470 --> 10:59.910
and we'll all live

10:59.970 --> 11:01.540
in cities on the Moon.

11:01.610 --> 11:04.250
So, you see,
my sisters were wrong

11:04.310 --> 11:07.150
except about
the cities on the Moon.

11:07.210 --> 11:09.650
I was wrong about that, so...

11:09.710 --> 11:13.140
Well, you can see
how anyone can be wrong.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.890
( <i>groans )</i>

11:14.950 --> 11:17.750
Skinner:
Sleek, vigilant puma--

11:17.820 --> 11:20.020
Principal of the mountains.

11:21.990 --> 11:23.220
Hi, Lise.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.830
Want to quiz me
on the vowels?

11:24.900 --> 11:27.670
Janey, I'm about ready
to chuck the whole
stinkin' alphabet.

11:27.730 --> 11:28.290
Huh?

11:31.840 --> 11:34.780
Lisa, what
are you doing?

11:34.840 --> 11:36.780
That's
a bad-girl bathroom.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.150
Duh!

11:40.110 --> 11:41.380
You want to egg

11:41.450 --> 11:42.620
Skinner's car?

11:42.680 --> 11:44.190
Okay.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.490
What are you
looking at?

11:45.550 --> 11:46.090
Nothing.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.520
Then get out.

11:47.590 --> 11:49.960
'Cause we're figuring out
stuff to egg.

11:50.020 --> 11:53.130
Okay, but if you really
want to honk Skinner off

11:53.190 --> 11:55.560
I suggest you attack
the one thing

11:55.630 --> 11:58.330
he truly believes in.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.530
I saw some awful things in 'Nam

12:00.600 --> 12:03.640
but you really have to wonder
at the mentality

12:03.700 --> 12:06.040
that would desecrate
a helpless puma.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.030
I never thought I'd say this

12:08.110 --> 12:10.640
but the no-goodniks
rule this school.

12:10.710 --> 12:13.250
( <i>Willie yelling: )
<i>Get your hands off me!</i></i>

12:13.310 --> 12:15.650
God, I could really use
a half day.

12:15.710 --> 12:18.340
Think you're big men
with your handcuffs

12:18.420 --> 12:19.450
and blasted Tasers!

12:19.520 --> 12:20.990
Get him out of here.

12:21.050 --> 12:24.520
I'll get you, Bart Simpson,
if it's the last thing I do!

12:24.590 --> 12:25.930
What is this all about?

12:25.990 --> 12:27.930
Well it's quite simple,
really.

12:27.990 --> 12:31.890
I observed our friend,
Groundskeeper Willie, burning
leaves with a blatant disregard

12:31.960 --> 12:33.260
for our clean air laws.

12:33.330 --> 12:36.270
Bart Simpson on the side
of law and order?!

12:36.330 --> 12:38.530
Has the world gone topsy-turvy?

12:38.600 --> 12:39.900
That's right, man.

12:39.970 --> 12:42.040
I got my first taste
of authority

12:42.110 --> 12:43.610
and I liked it.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.350
Hmm.

12:45.410 --> 12:47.250
Bart, there are a lot
of trouble makers

12:47.310 --> 12:48.650
in this school

12:48.710 --> 12:50.880
and, Lord knows I can't be
everywhere at once.

12:50.950 --> 12:52.590
Go on.

12:52.650 --> 12:55.720
Look, let's can
the euphemisms, huh?
No more bull spit.

12:55.790 --> 12:57.120
How would you like to be
a hall monitor?

12:57.190 --> 12:59.230
Wouldn't that mean
squealing on other kids?

12:59.290 --> 13:00.690
That's the meat of it, yes.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.000
Hmm...

13:03.800 --> 13:05.070
Now, Witness X

13:05.130 --> 13:07.940
would you please tell the court
what you saw?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.740
I'd be more
than happy to.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.470
I saw Mr. Montone there

13:11.540 --> 13:13.510
seal Mr. Palaccio
in an oil drum

13:13.570 --> 13:15.540
and roll him
off the pier.

13:15.610 --> 13:16.810
I kill you!

13:16.880 --> 13:19.310
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

13:19.380 --> 13:20.920
I don't know.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.280
Oh, now...
you get to wear a sash.

13:23.350 --> 13:24.450
( <i>gasps )</i>

13:24.520 --> 13:27.090
You got yourself a narc.

13:27.150 --> 13:30.420
Hey Jimbo,
keeping your nose clean, dude?
Thatta boy.

13:30.490 --> 13:31.790
Hey, Donna,
who loves you, baby?

13:34.160 --> 13:35.060
( <i>yelling )</i>

13:35.130 --> 13:36.500
Not in my hall, bub.

13:38.330 --> 13:40.570
I think you've had enough,
sister.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.540
Come on,
let's keep it moving.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.540
Pink belly! Pink belly!

13:44.600 --> 13:45.360
Pink belly!

13:45.440 --> 13:47.110
All right, break it up, boys.

13:47.170 --> 13:49.510
- That belly ain't going
to get <i>any pinker.
- Okay.</i>

13:49.570 --> 13:50.570
Wedgie!

13:50.640 --> 13:51.580
( <i>grunts )</i>

13:51.640 --> 13:54.100
( <i>boys laughing )</i>

13:54.180 --> 13:55.980
( <i>painfully: )
Thanks, Bart.</i>

13:59.020 --> 14:01.820
Bart's grades
are up a little this term

14:01.890 --> 14:03.790
but Lisa's are way down.

14:03.860 --> 14:07.800
Oh, we always have one good kid
and one lousy kid.

14:07.860 --> 14:09.930
Why can't both our kids
be good?

14:09.990 --> 14:11.990
We have three kids,
Homer.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.660
Marge, the dog doesn't count
as a kid.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.490
No. Maggie.

14:17.570 --> 14:18.740
Oh, yeah.

14:18.800 --> 14:21.670
Now take some paste
and spread it

14:21.740 --> 14:23.580
on the construction paper.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.910
Ralph, are you eating
your paste?

14:25.980 --> 14:27.580
( <i>muffled: )
No, Miss Hoover.</i>

14:27.650 --> 14:31.020
Good. Now sprinkle your sparkles
on your paste.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.940
Lisa, you're not sprinkling
your sparkles.

14:34.020 --> 14:34.960
Shove it.

14:35.020 --> 14:35.820
( <i>gasps )</i>

14:35.890 --> 14:37.120
I have never seen

14:37.190 --> 14:39.390
a good student
take such a slide.

14:39.460 --> 14:40.730
Lisa, what are you

14:40.790 --> 14:42.360
rebelling against?

14:42.430 --> 14:43.960
What do you got?

14:44.030 --> 14:44.830
( <i>gasps )</i>

14:47.570 --> 14:48.940
isa told Hoover
to shove it."

14:49.000 --> 14:50.800
and I'm, like,
"no way..."

14:50.870 --> 14:53.240
and she's like " fraid so.."
and I'm all "woah!"
and she's like--

14:53.300 --> 14:55.030
Hey, Lisa, man.

14:55.110 --> 14:56.880
I'm, like, so impressed.

14:56.940 --> 15:00.280
When I was in
second grade, I was all
"Hi there! I'm so good."

15:00.350 --> 15:01.220
Want a smoke?

15:03.350 --> 15:06.350
Uh... I'll smoke it in class.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.020
Whoa!
Whoa!

15:08.090 --> 15:10.290
Bart, you're doing
a bang-up job.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.860
Before, there were some
corridors in this school

15:12.920 --> 15:14.120
you'd just never go down.

15:14.190 --> 15:15.760
Now I feel safe anywhere.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.700
Every day
is a new fight, Sir.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.020
Bart, the school
is a police state.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.000
Students are afraid
to sneeze.

15:22.070 --> 15:23.500
I have you to thank.

15:23.570 --> 15:25.540
Come with me.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.900
<i>Madre de dios!</i>

15:27.970 --> 15:30.430
The legends were true!

15:30.510 --> 15:33.150
Yes Bart, whenever a teacher
confiscates something

15:33.210 --> 15:34.210
it ends up here.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.720
Salacious halter tops

15:35.780 --> 15:38.290
complete collections
of <i>Mad, Cracked</i>

15:38.350 --> 15:40.450
and the occasional issue
of <i>Crazy</i>

15:40.520 --> 15:42.520
and this fake plastic derriere.

15:42.590 --> 15:44.490
( <i>laughing )</i>

15:44.560 --> 15:47.530
Now, to show my gratitude,
I want you

15:47.590 --> 15:50.430
to help yourself
to an item of your choice.

15:51.830 --> 15:53.700
All right!

15:53.770 --> 15:56.100
Ooh, now you be careful
with that crossbow.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.300
I will.

16:06.980 --> 16:09.350
Seymour.
This is an absence slip

16:09.410 --> 16:10.440
signed by Nelson's mother

16:10.520 --> 16:13.050
and this
is Nelson's English homework.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.360
Notice the identical
elongated loops on the D's.

16:16.420 --> 16:19.990
Forgery!
So he <i>didn't have leprosy.</i>

16:24.660 --> 16:27.730
This is a great day for me.
I thought I could never teach
again.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.070
Things have changed.

16:29.130 --> 16:32.400
There will be no mockery
of your name, Mr. Glasscock.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.810
Hey, Louis, watch this.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.320
Ow! Bart, do something!

16:46.380 --> 16:48.210
Let's go, Milhouse.

16:48.290 --> 16:51.890
Milhouse:
Sure, we have order--
but at what price?

16:53.790 --> 16:57.060
Now let's correct
our homework exercises.

16:57.130 --> 17:01.440
Lisa, what 19th century figure
was nicknamed Old Hickory?

17:01.500 --> 17:03.670
I don't know. You?

17:03.740 --> 17:04.940
( <i>kids laughing )</i>

17:05.000 --> 17:07.869
Lisa, if you'd bothered
to do the assignment

17:07.940 --> 17:10.410
you'd know the answer is...

17:10.480 --> 17:12.780
The Battle of New Orleans...

17:12.839 --> 17:15.440
I mean... Andrew Jackson.

17:15.510 --> 17:18.510
Well, you're earning
your 18 grand a year.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.640
( <i>kids laughing )</i>

17:20.720 --> 17:23.089
( <i>Lisa coughing )</i>

17:23.150 --> 17:24.579
Stupid Hoover.

17:24.660 --> 17:26.690
Thinks she's so smart.

17:26.760 --> 17:31.100
She wouldn't be so smart
without her <i>teacher's edition.</i>

( <i>chuckling )</i>

17:51.380 --> 17:54.280

17:54.350 --> 17:56.360
Uh, ladies and gentlemen

17:56.420 --> 17:58.390
the unthinkable has happened.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.890
Some sick, twisted individual
has stolen

18:00.960 --> 18:03.530
every teacher's edition
in this school.

18:03.590 --> 18:04.320
What do we do?

18:04.400 --> 18:05.470
Declare a snow day!

18:05.530 --> 18:06.230
Does anyone know

18:06.300 --> 18:07.940
the multiplication table?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.370
Please, don't panic.

18:10.270 --> 18:12.170
They can smell fear.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.310
Children, I know this is
highly irregular, but for
the rest of the day

18:15.370 --> 18:16.130
Martin will be teaching

18:16.210 --> 18:17.480
<i>this class.</i>

18:17.540 --> 18:19.880
I will? But I wouldn't
know where to begin.

18:19.940 --> 18:21.040
Just do it, brainiac.

18:21.110 --> 18:24.080
Have I ever told you kids
about the '60s?

18:24.150 --> 18:27.690
( <i>kids clamoring )</i>

18:27.750 --> 18:31.990
I've got to get out of here.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.430
Calm blue ocean,
calm blue ocean.

18:34.490 --> 18:36.960
Calm blue ocean,
calm blue ocean.

18:37.030 --> 18:38.630
I'm leaving the
profession again.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.900
Oh, now Mr. Glasscock,
please reconsider.

18:40.970 --> 18:42.470
Uh-uh.

18:43.530 --> 18:45.600

18:45.670 --> 18:48.180
Bart, the police
haven't had any luck

18:48.240 --> 18:50.210
finding
the teacher's editions.

18:50.270 --> 18:51.600
The dogs

18:51.680 --> 18:54.350
have picked up
the scent of books.

18:54.410 --> 18:56.050
Send in
the battering ram.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.740
Here we go.

18:59.220 --> 19:01.420
We're going to have
to reorder every book.

19:01.490 --> 19:03.220
Seymour,
I'll bet you a steak dinner

19:03.290 --> 19:05.130
those books are still here.

19:05.190 --> 19:07.490
All we have to do is
search every locker.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.560
Bart, I'm not sure
locker searches

19:08.630 --> 19:10.630
are permitted
by the Supreme Court.

19:10.700 --> 19:11.700
Pfft! Supreme Court.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.590
What have they done
for us lately?

19:13.660 --> 19:14.360
Let's move.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.250
Hmm...

19:28.050 --> 19:28.920
Baa!

20:02.850 --> 20:03.980
That's right.

20:04.050 --> 20:05.590
It was I.

20:05.650 --> 20:07.620
Lise, why did you do it?

20:07.690 --> 20:08.660
Come on, Bart!

20:08.720 --> 20:10.360
In your pre-fascist days

20:10.420 --> 20:12.890
you knew the giddy thrill
of futile rebellion.

20:12.960 --> 20:15.100
Yeah, but even I
had my limits.

20:15.160 --> 20:18.100
You're looking
at expulsion for this.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.760
I know! I know!

20:19.830 --> 20:21.070

20:22.300 --> 20:25.310
( <i>Skinner gasps )</i>

20:25.370 --> 20:26.840
The books!

20:26.900 --> 20:30.230
Oh, answers! Answers!

20:30.310 --> 20:34.680
Simpson, you've just saved
this school $120.

20:34.750 --> 20:38.350
Who's behind
this monstrous crime?

20:38.420 --> 20:39.420
I am.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.610
( <i>gasping )</i>

20:41.690 --> 20:43.420
Skinner:
<i>I've been so blind.
In retrospect,</i>

20:43.490 --> 20:46.660
The signs all pointed
to a rogue hall monitor.

20:46.720 --> 20:49.690
Sorry if I betrayed your trust,
Principal Sucker.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.600
Now Bart, in light
of your recent service
to the school

20:52.660 --> 20:54.620
I've decided to be lenient.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.270
400 days detention.

20:56.330 --> 20:57.330
400 days.

20:57.400 --> 20:59.410
I can do that
standing on my head.

20:59.470 --> 21:01.110
All right, 500 days.

21:01.170 --> 21:02.710
Ooh! Big man!

21:02.770 --> 21:04.170
600 days.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.650
Maybe I'll just
shut my big mouth.

21:06.710 --> 21:09.150
Let's go, Simpson.

21:09.210 --> 21:11.510
Bart, why did you
take the blame?

21:11.580 --> 21:14.510
'Cause I didn't want you
to wreck your life.

21:14.590 --> 21:17.420
You got the brains and talent
to go as far as you want

21:17.490 --> 21:18.760
and when you do

21:18.820 --> 21:21.150
I'll be right there
to borrow money.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.830
Oh, Bart.
