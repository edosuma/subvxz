Yeah. Everyone's either
booked for the holidays

17:13.700 --> 17:16.234
or spending Christmas
with their families.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.735
[groans]

17:17.737 --> 17:20.838
I mean, there has to be someone
I haven't thought of yet.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.740
Well, when are we going to talk
about the elephant,

17:22.742 --> 17:24.842
or dare I say, bobcat
in the room?

17:24.844 --> 17:26.010
Oh, you didn't.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.045
Sorry, I had to.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.079
-but they're not booked.
-Jackson...

17:28.081 --> 17:29.380
-for any shows over
the holidays.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.449
They fired me. Remember?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.117
You need a big-name act.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.387
I have... options.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.423
You have Kevin Timbers.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.893
Hey, didn't you play guitar?

17:41.895 --> 17:44.228
What? That was
a long time ago.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.531
Look, I know this is the last
thing you want to do.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.299
But if you want to impress
The Emperor,

17:48.301 --> 17:49.767
you need star power.

17:49.769 --> 17:53.204
Wild Lynx is as big
and convenient as it gets.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.140
They'll help attract
other acts too.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.142
I hate it when you're right.

17:58.144 --> 17:59.644
Do you have a...

18:00.880 --> 18:01.746
Thank you.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.081
Just think of it
as business.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.482
The least those guys can do

18:04.484 --> 18:06.551
is help you move forward
in your career.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.086
Ryan owes you.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.922

<i> ♪</i>

18:10.924 --> 18:18.129
♪

18:18.798 --> 18:20.665
I came as soon as I heard.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.101
I'm here to save your show.

18:23.103 --> 18:23.968
[sighs]

18:30.827 --> 18:32.360
This is such a nice surprise.

18:32.362 --> 18:33.761
Well... You here to see Ryan?

18:33.763 --> 18:36.631
Yeah. Well, no...
For business.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.099
Oh.

18:38.101 --> 18:39.834
Okay. Well, he should be back
from his run any minute.

18:39.836 --> 18:41.869
In the meantime, you can help
us decorate Christmas cookies.

18:41.871 --> 18:42.637
Aww!

18:42.639 --> 18:43.671
Hey, look who's here.

18:43.673 --> 18:45.306
[laughs]
Hey.

18:45.308 --> 18:47.008
Hey Claire.

18:47.010 --> 18:48.042
These smell amazing.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.210
Are these for
the white elephant?

18:49.212 --> 18:50.111
Yes.

18:50.113 --> 18:51.212
Got your present yet?

18:51.214 --> 18:52.547
Uh, no.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.282
That is one more thing on
a long list of things

18:54.284 --> 18:55.216
I still need to do.

18:55.218 --> 18:56.350
Woo!

18:56.352 --> 18:57.852
Busy time.

18:57.854 --> 19:02.356
I think that is the first time
I've exercised in a year.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.058
It's a good thing there's
no paparazzi out there.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.327
I don't want anyone to see me
looking like this.

19:06.329 --> 19:08.462
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.331
Don't know what's worse,
how you look right now

19:10.333 --> 19:13.067
or the fact that you're worried
about how you look right now.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.136
You mean, the guy who used
to use a bottle of hair gel

19:15.138 --> 19:16.470
before every single show?

19:16.472 --> 19:17.338
[laughs]

19:17.340 --> 19:18.372
Oh, my gosh, yes.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.707
How many times
before a gig did I hear

19:19.709 --> 19:20.842
"Claire, I forgot my hair gel."

19:20.844 --> 19:22.410
Okay, the slick look was in.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.846
No. More than once I had to tell
a club owner to move the lights

19:24.848 --> 19:26.747
because we were worried
your hair was a fire hazard.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.049
[laughs]

19:28.051 --> 19:29.250
Okay, this is fun.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.318
Um...

19:31.354 --> 19:33.387
Claire, to what do we owe
the pleasure?

19:36.893 --> 19:38.693
Do you mind
if we take a walk?

19:38.695 --> 19:40.561
Oh uh, yeah sure.

19:40.563 --> 19:42.864
Just let me change and grab
one of these for the road.

19:42.866 --> 19:43.898
Hey!

19:47.370 --> 19:49.770
Wow, the Wishing Tree.

19:49.772 --> 19:53.507
Haven't been there in forever.
Last time was probably with you.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.276
Yeah. I think that was
when you wished

19:55.278 --> 19:56.677
that Wild Lynx would
make it big.

19:56.679 --> 20:00.381
Jeez. Sounds so cringey now.

20:00.383 --> 20:02.083
What was your wish?

20:02.085 --> 20:05.586
That I'd be right there with you
as your manager.

20:08.091 --> 20:10.791
I'm on fire today.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.393
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's fine.

20:12.395 --> 20:16.297
Listen, I'm... I'm not here
to talk about all that.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.899
Okay.

20:17.901 --> 20:21.936
So, rebooking the show has been
a bit tougher than I thought,

20:21.938 --> 20:27.608
and I what I wanted to ask you
is... this is hard.

20:27.610 --> 20:29.076
Okay...

20:30.113 --> 20:33.948
Do you think Wild Lynx
could headline for me?

20:36.386 --> 20:37.118
[sighs]

20:37.120 --> 20:39.754
We can't. I'm sorry.

20:39.756 --> 20:41.289
What?

20:41.291 --> 20:42.757
I had to meditate before I came
here just to get Zen enough

20:42.759 --> 20:44.825
to ask you this favor
and now you're saying no?

20:44.827 --> 20:47.962
Well, look... If it was up to me
it'd be a yes in a second.

20:47.964 --> 20:52.266
But... the band isn't
getting along.

20:52.268 --> 20:54.969
Well, no, it's... it's just me
and Alistair.

20:54.971 --> 20:57.138
We're not speaking
at the moment.

20:57.140 --> 20:59.073
Oh. Why?

20:59.075 --> 21:00.841
It's complicated.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.678
But that's the real reason we
came out here for the holidays.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.314
Give ourselves some space.

21:06.316 --> 21:09.116
Gosh. I'm sorry.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.187
If you don't mind my asking,

21:13.189 --> 21:14.655
why are you putting so much
pressure on yourself

21:14.657 --> 21:16.524
for the show this year?

21:16.526 --> 21:18.859
It's usually much more low-key.
Couldn't you just do that?

21:18.861 --> 21:20.861
No, I, I can't.

21:20.863 --> 21:25.499
Um, I'm on my final interview
for my dream job

21:25.501 --> 21:28.369
at The Emperor Resorts
in Las Vegas.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.137
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:30.139 --> 21:31.706
They're sending a rep
to see the show

21:31.708 --> 21:34.275
so, it can't just be
run of the mill.

21:34.277 --> 21:36.944
Ugh, everything was on track
until Ashley Burns cancelled

21:36.946 --> 21:39.447
and it all imploded.

21:39.449 --> 21:44.719
Huh. Okay. So, Vegas.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.988
What? You knew I never intended
to stay at the inn.

21:46.990 --> 21:52.059
I mean, I've loved it,
of course, but after we...

21:52.061 --> 21:53.361
Broke up.

21:53.363 --> 21:57.131
Yes, that. But after we stopped
working together

21:57.133 --> 22:02.636
I realized that my real passion
was putting on live events.

22:02.638 --> 22:06.640
Seeing the joy it brings people.

22:06.642 --> 22:09.176
And at The Emperor I'd be able
to do that full-time,

22:09.178 --> 22:11.579
working with the best
in the business.

22:11.581 --> 22:14.915
So, if I don't make the move now
I might never get another shot.

22:14.917 --> 22:17.518
What does your dad think?

22:17.520 --> 22:20.521
He doesn't know. I knew it
would upset him.

22:20.523 --> 22:24.725
I didn't want to say anything
unless it was actually
going to happen,

22:24.727 --> 22:30.031
and now it appears
that it won't, so...

22:31.667 --> 22:34.568
Look. I know a ton of people
in the industry.

22:34.570 --> 22:36.570
Maybe I could
make some calls.

22:36.572 --> 22:38.606
I don't know. See if
anybody's available.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.674
You don't have to do that.
I'll figure it out.

22:42.845 --> 22:46.614
What if we call it my Christmas
present to you?

22:46.616 --> 22:49.183
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:49.185 --> 22:53.054
Fine. Um, thank you.

22:53.056 --> 22:54.955
Of course.

22:54.957 --> 22:57.191
I mean, I was planning
on catching up on sleep

22:57.193 --> 22:59.894
for the first time in,
you know, six years.

22:59.896 --> 23:01.028
Stop it.

23:01.030 --> 23:02.596
Yeah, no your thing sounds
fun though.

23:07.570 --> 23:09.070
Wow.

23:09.072 --> 23:11.038
I am totally flashing back
to that Christmas Eve concert

23:11.040 --> 23:13.140
we played in senior year
of college.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.776
That one where Chaos threw
his drumsticks into the crowd

23:15.778 --> 23:18.546
and basically knocked out
that old lady?

23:18.548 --> 23:21.615
Yeah. He uh, he stopped
doing that.

23:21.617 --> 23:23.717
Peppermint latte, right?

23:24.320 --> 23:27.988
Yes. That's right.
Um, thanks.

23:30.126 --> 23:33.928
So, um, what are you
doing here?

23:33.930 --> 23:35.296
I got some good news

23:35.298 --> 23:36.964
and I thought I'd come
tell you in person.

23:36.966 --> 23:38.599
Oh, you patched things up
with Alistair

23:38.601 --> 23:40.768
and Wild Lynx can play
the show?

23:40.770 --> 23:42.503
-No.
-Darn it.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.839
Do you know the group
Fleur Du Ciel?

23:44.841 --> 23:48.008
Yeah, the acrobat group
out of San Francisco?

23:48.010 --> 23:49.577
They're awesome. Huge.

23:49.579 --> 23:51.412
We have the same agent so
I called them this morning

23:51.414 --> 23:53.013
and they are not booked
for Christmas Eve

23:53.015 --> 23:55.916
and no one is traveling
for the holidays.

23:55.918 --> 23:58.519
So, I gave them your number and
he's going to be reaching out.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.187
Wait, really?

24:00.189 --> 24:01.755
Wow. Thank you.

24:01.757 --> 24:02.823
[laughs]

24:02.825 --> 24:04.592
Obviously, it's not a done deal

24:04.594 --> 24:07.428
but it's at least a solid lead,
right?

24:07.430 --> 24:08.295
Yeah.

24:08.297 --> 24:09.663
[laughs]

24:09.665 --> 24:12.433
Boy, that does wonders
for my Christmas spirit.

24:12.435 --> 24:13.767
And my Christmas anxiety.

24:13.769 --> 24:15.302
[chuckles]

24:15.304 --> 24:16.804
I've spent the whole morning
basically stalking performers

24:16.806 --> 24:19.206
on social media to see if anyone
happens to be vacationing

24:19.208 --> 24:21.108
in Tahoe for the holidays.

24:21.110 --> 24:22.109
And?

24:22.111 --> 24:25.846
All I could find so far
was this.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.349
#TahoeBabes.

24:28.351 --> 24:31.318
#MomJokes.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.053
[laughs]

24:33.055 --> 24:35.122
Here. Let me see what
I can find.

24:37.860 --> 24:40.528
You know, um,
I was thinking.

24:40.530 --> 24:44.865
Would it be crazy if you did
a solo set?

24:44.867 --> 24:47.001
No one wants to see just
the guitar player.

24:47.003 --> 24:49.236
The mob at the Christmas market
would disagree.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.505
Yeah. I think one of them got
a lock of my hair.

24:51.507 --> 24:53.541
Okay. How about this guy?

24:55.077 --> 24:56.710
Uh, no.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.245
[laughs]

24:58.247 --> 25:00.848
Anyway... I don't have any
of my own material

25:00.850 --> 25:03.984
and Alistair would flip if
I played the band's songs.

25:03.986 --> 25:06.487
Okay, but you don't have
any of your own material?

25:06.489 --> 25:10.858
You're an incredible songwriter.
I thought you loved that.

25:10.860 --> 25:13.827
It's actually this whole issue
with Alistair.

25:13.829 --> 25:18.399
Okay, what do you mean?

25:18.401 --> 25:22.102
Well, because I want
to be writing more.

25:22.104 --> 25:23.437
I have all these ideas,

25:23.439 --> 25:26.207
it's just too hard for me
to focus on the road.

25:26.209 --> 25:30.177
I know plenty of people
can do it but not me.

25:30.179 --> 25:32.513
It just, it feels like there's
always somewhere to be.

25:32.515 --> 25:34.682
Gigs, rehearsals,
airports, promotions.

25:34.684 --> 25:38.953
It's... it's exhausting.

25:38.955 --> 25:42.556
Plus, I don't know, I think
it's starting to wear on me.

25:42.558 --> 25:46.427
So, I told Alistair
that I wanted to cut back
on tour dates.

25:46.429 --> 25:49.563
He accused me of sabotaging
the group,

25:49.565 --> 25:50.598
not being a team player.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.865
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

25:51.867 --> 25:56.971
Jeez Alistair.
He's always all or nothing.

25:56.973 --> 25:59.373
How did the other guys feel?

25:59.375 --> 26:01.942
They're staying out of it.
Trying to keep the peace.

26:01.944 --> 26:03.811
Sounds like them.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.280
Yeah, so...

26:06.282 --> 26:10.050
Now I just... I don't know
what to do.

26:13.990 --> 26:16.223
Remember when you sang
the first few lines

26:16.225 --> 26:19.960
of "Christmas Island" to me
at The Wishing Tree?

26:19.962 --> 26:22.896
Yeah. I was ready
to scrap it.

26:22.898 --> 26:25.065
You said it was going
to be a big hit.

26:25.067 --> 26:27.134
And it was.

26:27.136 --> 26:29.236
And now it's a perennial
Christmas staple

26:29.238 --> 26:31.171
that literally haunts me
everywhere I go.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.973
[laughs]

26:32.975 --> 26:35.909
Anyway, all I know
is you're...

26:35.911 --> 26:38.279
you're too good not
to be writing.

26:41.117 --> 26:42.616
[gasps]

26:42.618 --> 26:44.418
Ricki Page is vacationing
in Tahoe.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.853
The comedian?

26:45.855 --> 26:47.921
Yeah, she'd be great. How are
you going to find where-

26:47.923 --> 26:49.690
The Ridgley.

26:49.692 --> 26:51.492
Okay what?
How did you?

26:51.494 --> 26:54.762
Complimentary ski pass. We give
them out all the time.

26:54.764 --> 26:55.629
[laughs]

26:55.631 --> 26:57.698
Okay. That is some A+ stalking.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.667
Remind me not to get
on your bad side.

26:59.669 --> 27:01.669
Uh... Your worse side.

27:01.671 --> 27:04.104
I'm calling her manager.

27:04.106 --> 27:05.439
Yes, hello.

27:05.441 --> 27:08.442
This is Claire Rhodes
from The Inn on the Lake.

27:08.444 --> 27:09.710
Yes.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.812
Would Ricki Page happen
to be available

27:11.814 --> 27:14.448
for our annual variety show
on Christmas Eve?

27:18.988 --> 27:20.020
Right.

27:21.691 --> 27:24.725
Sure, yeah.
I... I understand.

27:26.662 --> 27:28.128
Thank you.

27:28.130 --> 27:31.298
Thank you so much and um,
Merry Christmas to you too.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.501
Surprise, surprise.

27:34.503 --> 27:37.371
She's all booked up and wouldn't
be interested.

27:37.373 --> 27:40.674
Well, at risk of kicking
a hornet's nest,

27:40.676 --> 27:43.644
we both know that bands don't
always listen to their managers.

27:43.646 --> 27:45.713
I assume it's the same
for comedians.

27:45.715 --> 27:47.648
How do I get to her?

27:47.650 --> 27:49.683
Does Jackson
still work here?

27:51.253 --> 27:53.654
...yeah, of course.

27:53.656 --> 27:55.222
Hey.

27:55.224 --> 27:57.725
Oh, hey Ryan.
Welcome back.

27:57.727 --> 28:01.562
Hey thanks, man.
Good to be here.

28:01.564 --> 28:04.498
So, Claire has a lead on a
replacement act for the show

28:04.500 --> 28:06.367
and she needs your help
with an RSI.

28:06.369 --> 28:07.401
What's an RSI?

28:07.403 --> 28:10.037
Ooh. An RSI?
That's some heavy stuff.

28:10.039 --> 28:10.704
Heavy?

28:10.706 --> 28:12.206
What's heavy?

28:12.208 --> 28:14.074
What's The Inn on the Lake's
network like at the Ridgley?

28:14.076 --> 28:15.442
It's doable.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.445
I did a successful FTP
and a PCT there a while back.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.014
But I haven't completed
a RSI in a while.

28:21.016 --> 28:22.249
Let me check my contact.

28:22.251 --> 28:24.351
Great. It's for Ricki Page.

28:24.353 --> 28:25.886
Oh, she'll be under

28:25.888 --> 28:27.121
-MIP.
-MIP.

28:27.123 --> 28:28.689
One sec.

28:28.691 --> 28:31.191
Okay. Will someone please tell
me what we're talking about?

28:31.193 --> 28:33.927
An RSI stands for
room service interloper.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.063
It's how fans get access
to a celebrity's hotel room

28:36.065 --> 28:37.898
via the concierge network.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.566
Why do I have a feeling
I'm about to pose

28:39.568 --> 28:41.068
as a room service attendant?

28:41.070 --> 28:42.903
Because we're about to pose
as room service attendants.

28:42.905 --> 28:44.037
Sorry, we?

28:44.039 --> 28:46.573
Oh, yeah. No way
am I going to miss this.

28:46.575 --> 28:48.108
It's all set up.

28:48.110 --> 28:51.278
My guy will meet you in the
service hallway by the kitchen.

28:51.280 --> 28:53.647
He'll have a complimentary
bottle of bubbly

28:53.649 --> 28:56.650
and a plate of French fries
to be delivered to Miss Page.

28:56.652 --> 28:57.718
Why fries?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.086
Who doesn't love fries?

29:00.222 --> 29:01.555
Also, something called
faux fries

29:01.557 --> 29:03.557
that are made from seaweed.

29:03.559 --> 29:07.060
I'm just uh... I'm going to just
pretend this is normal

29:07.062 --> 29:08.262
and just go with it.

29:08.264 --> 29:10.631
Yeah. That's called an accessory
after the...

29:10.633 --> 29:11.565
I didn't hear anything.

29:11.567 --> 29:13.000
Go for Otis.

29:17.106 --> 29:19.106
Probably best if you talk fast
once we're in.

29:19.108 --> 29:20.441
You know what you're going
to say yet?

29:20.443 --> 29:21.809
Yeah, I was going to wing it.

29:21.811 --> 29:23.043
I'm kidding.

29:23.045 --> 29:24.678
No. Ricki's engaged so
I'm going to offer her

29:24.680 --> 29:27.014
two weeks at the honeymoon
suite, spa treatments,
the works.

29:27.016 --> 29:29.183
In addition to her fee. Treat
them like the royal couple.

29:29.185 --> 29:32.386
I like it.
Okay, this is it.

29:32.388 --> 29:33.954
[knocks]

29:33.956 --> 29:35.722
Hey, what do you usually do

29:35.724 --> 29:37.024
when someone room service
interlopes you?

29:37.026 --> 29:38.158
Oh, I call security.

29:38.160 --> 29:39.393
Wait, what?

29:42.331 --> 29:44.631
I didn't order anything.

29:44.633 --> 29:46.967
Compliments of the hotel.

29:46.969 --> 29:50.971
Oh. Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

29:50.973 --> 29:52.739
You can set it up
over by the couch.

29:53.876 --> 29:54.908
[clears throat]

30:06.088 --> 30:08.322
[stammers]
So... Miss Page. I...

30:08.324 --> 30:11.492
Have you ever been dumped
at Christmas?

30:11.994 --> 30:13.427
No?

30:13.429 --> 30:15.863
I mean, who does that?

30:15.865 --> 30:17.397
Everyone knows there's
an unwritten rule

30:17.399 --> 30:19.333
that after Thanksgiving you ride
the relationship out

30:19.335 --> 30:22.202
until January even if you're
both miserable.

30:22.204 --> 30:23.070
[sighs]

30:24.773 --> 30:27.341
Look at all these Christmas
presents I bought him.

30:27.343 --> 30:28.775
What a waste.

30:29.378 --> 30:32.112
I'm so sorry.

30:32.114 --> 30:33.247
French fries?

30:33.249 --> 30:34.348
No.

30:34.617 --> 30:35.782
Yes.

30:43.559 --> 30:45.726
That bottle's not going
to open itself.

30:48.030 --> 30:50.464
Wait. We know each other?

30:50.466 --> 30:52.399
Nope.

30:52.401 --> 30:53.867
You know what, um...

30:53.869 --> 30:55.936
I don't know if this helps
but I do know what it's like

30:55.938 --> 30:58.539
to have a relationship end
before a big event.

30:58.541 --> 31:00.807
It's the worst.

31:00.809 --> 31:03.610
Right? What happened to you?

31:03.612 --> 31:06.046
Well, I happened to be managing
a local band.

31:06.048 --> 31:07.881
-Dating the lead guitarist.
-Mmm.

31:07.883 --> 31:10.050
Things really started
to take off for them

31:10.052 --> 31:13.921
and then they just got...
difficult.

31:13.923 --> 31:14.922
Heads get bigger.

31:14.924 --> 31:16.557
Pfft. Rock stars.

31:16.559 --> 31:18.091
They're not all bad.

31:19.395 --> 31:21.061
They thought they were
outgrowing me,

31:21.063 --> 31:23.430
started resisting my ideas.

31:23.432 --> 31:27.000
Next thing you know
they dropped me for
a big-time manager.

31:27.002 --> 31:30.270
And then they sign with a label
at a showcase that, get this,

31:30.272 --> 31:31.672
I booked for them.

31:31.674 --> 31:33.340
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

31:35.144 --> 31:36.677
It's a rough business out there,
I get it.

31:36.679 --> 31:41.248
But I was at least expecting
some support from my boyfriend

31:41.250 --> 31:43.584
which didn't really happen.

31:43.586 --> 31:44.618
[cork pops loudly]

31:47.823 --> 31:50.691
Needless to say,
we broke up too.

31:50.693 --> 31:52.960
Oh, girl.

31:52.962 --> 31:54.094
Bring it in.

31:54.096 --> 31:56.163
Come on. Yeah. Yeah.
Hug it out.

31:56.165 --> 31:57.030
That's okay.

31:57.032 --> 31:58.332
If I could just chime in here.

31:58.334 --> 32:00.000
There are two sides
to every story.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.502
My side's all she needs
to hear.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.338
He's in training.

32:04.340 --> 32:05.372
Ah.

32:07.009 --> 32:08.642
Thanks.

32:09.478 --> 32:11.511
You know what really got me
back on my feet?

32:11.513 --> 32:13.447
Throwing myself into my work.

32:13.449 --> 32:16.817
It helped me to figure out
what I really wanted

32:16.819 --> 32:20.954
and now I have no regrets.

32:20.956 --> 32:23.857
So, you're saying I should
just forget about him

32:23.859 --> 32:26.159
as quickly as possible.

32:26.161 --> 32:28.195
Not exactly.

32:28.197 --> 32:33.900
Look, Ricki... your gift is
to make people laugh

32:33.902 --> 32:36.970
and help them feel better
about themselves.

32:36.972 --> 32:45.045
So, I say why not turn this
relationship egg into eggnog

32:45.047 --> 32:48.548
and use it for material?

32:48.550 --> 32:52.185
-Wow. Room service therapy.
-Mm-hmm.

32:52.187 --> 32:56.490
This is a good hotel.
And you're a good server.

32:56.492 --> 32:59.059
About that.

32:59.061 --> 33:00.427
You're a room service
interloper.

33:00.429 --> 33:02.162
Okay, let me explain.

33:02.164 --> 33:03.530
And now that I think
about it.

33:03.532 --> 33:05.732
Aren't you a musician
or something?

33:05.734 --> 33:10.671
Hold on. No way.
You're in Wild Lynx!

33:10.673 --> 33:11.705
Guilty.

33:11.707 --> 33:13.173
Woah.

33:13.175 --> 33:15.609
I gotta hear this.

33:15.611 --> 33:18.879
All right. Christmas Eve
I'll give you 30 minutes.

33:18.881 --> 33:20.781
Now go fill out the rest of
the show with cool acts

33:20.783 --> 33:21.715
so I don't regret this.

33:21.717 --> 33:22.949
Thank you. We will.

33:22.951 --> 33:25.385
It's going to be an amazing
night, trust me.

33:25.387 --> 33:27.120
Are you sure I can
have this?

33:27.122 --> 33:29.423
Totally. It's just a stocking
stuffer.

33:29.425 --> 33:32.059
Okay great.
See you soon.

33:36.298 --> 33:40.467
Hey, for what it's worth,
you all make a good team.

33:40.469 --> 33:43.470
My guy would've never done
something like this for me.

33:45.741 --> 33:46.973
♪

33:46.975 --> 33:49.309
So, one down
and how many to go?

33:49.311 --> 33:51.111
Um, two at least.

33:51.113 --> 33:53.714
Can't really call it a variety
show with anything less.

33:53.716 --> 33:56.750
All right. One down,
two to go.

33:58.987 --> 34:00.821
Thank you for coming with me.

34:00.823 --> 34:05.492
I never thought I'd say this,
but you were actually helpful.

34:05.494 --> 34:07.160
No, come on. That was
all you in there.

34:07.162 --> 34:10.063
I forgot how good you were
in a room.

34:11.934 --> 34:14.234
Uh look, um...

34:14.236 --> 34:19.573
I wanted to say what you said
to Ricki in there was true

34:19.575 --> 34:23.577
and I'm sorry...
for everything.

34:23.579 --> 34:25.445
We really did think signing
with a more established manager

34:25.447 --> 34:28.615
was a good move at the time.

34:28.617 --> 34:32.819
But did we have to?
I don't know.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.922
I think the real problem was
I thought we could separate

34:35.924 --> 34:37.758
our personal and business
relationship

34:37.760 --> 34:45.532
and that was naive and unfair,
and I'm sorry.

34:45.534 --> 34:46.600
Thanks.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.671
You know, honestly
what ended up happening

34:51.673 --> 34:53.840
was probably for the best.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.843
I mean, the last thing anyone
wanted was for it all to derail

34:56.845 --> 34:59.379
because of the lead guitarist's
girlfriend.

34:59.381 --> 35:01.515
You were so much more
than that.

35:01.517 --> 35:04.518
I'm just saying.
You became a huge success

35:04.520 --> 35:06.620
and got to share your music
with the world

35:06.622 --> 35:08.822
and it allowed me
to figure out

35:08.824 --> 35:11.792
that I'm good not
managing bands.

35:11.794 --> 35:13.059
Or your egos.

35:13.061 --> 35:14.528
[laughs]

35:14.530 --> 35:17.330
Besides I... I would've hated
life on the road.

35:17.332 --> 35:19.499
That makes two of us.

35:20.702 --> 35:23.737
To um, letting bygones
be bygones?

35:23.739 --> 35:25.639
No better time than Christmas.

35:29.411 --> 35:31.578
So, are you going to open that?
See what Ricki Page got you?

35:31.580 --> 35:32.979
Oh, no way.

35:32.981 --> 35:34.381
I'm saving it for the white
elephant party.

35:34.383 --> 35:35.715
Saves me a trip to the store.

35:35.717 --> 35:37.751
Ah, man. I still have
to do that.

35:37.753 --> 35:39.986
Just give away a signed photo
of yourself.

35:39.988 --> 35:41.721
Hmm.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.890
The most self-absorbed gift
I could ever give.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.325
I like that. That's a really
good idea.

35:45.327 --> 35:46.393
Yeah. Good.
You're welcome.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.861
A stocking stuffer.

35:47.863 --> 35:49.329
[laughs]

35:52.417 --> 35:55.018
-Hey guys.
-Perfect timing.

35:55.020 --> 35:56.486
You can help us
hang ornaments.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.221
I am trying to find that
little special one

35:58.223 --> 35:59.923
that we always put on
at the very end.

35:59.925 --> 36:03.727
Hey, guess who booked Ricki Page
for a set for the concert.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.161
Who's Ricki Page?

36:05.163 --> 36:07.230
Ricki Page is an
incredible comedian.

36:07.232 --> 36:08.865
Honey, that's great.

36:08.867 --> 36:09.733
Thanks.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.435
I heard that Ryan helped you?

36:12.437 --> 36:13.670
Yes, Mom.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.238
That's good.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.606
So, you're all set then?

36:16.608 --> 36:19.676
No, I need a few more acts.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.411
Did you look in this one?

36:21.413 --> 36:23.947
No, I have not looked
in that box yet.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.115
-Here.
-Thank you.

36:25.117 --> 36:26.716
Did you say a few more acts?

36:26.718 --> 36:29.519
Claire honey, the show's
in five days.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.754
Please let me give...

36:30.756 --> 36:33.523
Listen, I... I have an
incredible acrobat group

36:33.525 --> 36:35.225
out of San Francisco
that's interested as well.

36:35.227 --> 36:36.393
They can headline.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.795
I just need a little,
little more time.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.430
Okay. But remember...

36:40.432 --> 36:44.467
To stay on top of my hotel
duties, I know, I...

36:44.469 --> 36:45.368
[sighs]

36:45.370 --> 36:46.469
I...

36:46.471 --> 36:49.039
Hey, what is it?

36:49.041 --> 36:51.241
I know you see
this variety show

36:51.243 --> 36:53.143
as just another thing we do
on the side.

36:53.145 --> 36:58.315
But it's... it's more than that
for me.

36:58.317 --> 37:01.818

48:17.512 --> 48:18.945

My family owns The Inn
on the Lake

48:21.616 --> 48:24.317
and every year we put on a big
Christmas Eve variety show.

48:24.319 --> 48:26.686
I had Ashley Burns headlining.

48:26.688 --> 48:28.354
Oh, I heard about that.

48:28.356 --> 48:29.855
It's still going to be
an incredible show.

We have Ricki Page doing a
set and Fleur Du Ciel as well,

48:34.128 --> 48:39.098
and I just know you all would
round out the evening perfectly.

48:39.100 --> 48:40.599
Sounds great

48:40.601 --> 48:42.535

told you we fly home tomorrow.

the perfect holiday atmosphere,

49:04.292 --> 49:09.862

to gingerbread house decorating.

I was a little girl,

the North Pole.

Look, I know how important it is
to be with your families

49:22.477 --> 49:26.846
during this time, so I'd be
happy to fly out your families.

49:26.848 --> 49:30.016
You can still spend
Christmas together.

49:30.018 --> 49:33.886
I promise you, if you come
spend Christmas with our family,

49:33.888 --> 49:38.357
you'll end up loving it
just as much as I do.

49:41.195 --> 49:43.362

Let's do it.

to see us perform

That's fantastic.

Thank you so much. We are going

You guys go warm up.

and then I'm going
to step back.

1:06:55.812 --> 1:06:59.714
Stay here and write some songs
for the band,

1:06:59.716 --> 1:07:03.251
some for me, and then
we'll play it by ear.

1:07:03.253 --> 1:07:05.053
They told me I can come back
any time I want.

1:07:05.055 --> 1:07:06.588
Ryan!

1:07:06.590 --> 1:07:07.622
I know.

1:07:08.592 --> 1:07:10.625
I told Alistair all about
the jam you're in,

1:07:10.627 --> 1:07:12.494
he insisted that we play
the show.

1:07:12.496 --> 1:07:15.396
Everybody agrees.
We're all in.

1:07:15.398 --> 1:07:18.299
With everything we've all been
through together

1:07:18.301 --> 1:07:19.801
we definitely owe you this.

1:07:19.803 --> 1:07:21.970
Gosh.

1:07:21.972 --> 1:07:26.941
I mean, um, thank you.

1:07:26.943 --> 1:07:28.943
I thought this is what
you wanted, Claire.

1:07:28.945 --> 1:07:30.779
To put on a killer show
that was going to impress

1:07:30.781 --> 1:07:32.113
The Emperor Resort so much

1:07:32.115 --> 1:07:33.615
that they're begging
to work with you.

1:07:33.617 --> 1:07:37.418
Right, right, I know. I really,
really appreciate it. I...

1:07:38.288 --> 1:07:40.255
I guess, I thought you'd
be happier.

1:07:40.257 --> 1:07:41.156
I am.

1:07:41.158 --> 1:07:42.991
I'm, I'm happy.
I really am.

1:07:42.993 --> 1:07:48.830
I just um, I don't know.

1:07:48.832 --> 1:07:52.100
These last few days
have just reminded me

1:07:52.102 --> 1:07:56.171
how special this place is.

1:07:56.173 --> 1:07:58.940
Now, you're gonna be
here and...

1:08:00.610 --> 1:08:02.877
It's going to be kind of hard
to say goodbye.

1:08:02.879 --> 1:08:04.479
I know.

1:08:04.481 --> 1:08:08.983
And believe me, selfishly I
don't want you to leave either.

1:08:08.985 --> 1:08:10.852
But I know what it's like
to go live out my dream

1:08:10.854 --> 1:08:14.889
and I want that for you.

1:08:14.891 --> 1:08:18.326
Or you might always
regret it.

1:08:25.335 --> 1:08:27.702
Yes, hi. The name's
Andre Hudson.

1:08:27.704 --> 1:08:30.638
It might also be under
The Emperor Resort's account.

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.140
Claire Rhodes,
your general manager,

1:08:32.142 --> 1:08:33.875
made the reservation.

1:08:33.877 --> 1:08:35.476
Mr. Hudson?

1:08:35.478 --> 1:08:36.911
I couldn't help but overhear.

1:08:36.913 --> 1:08:39.347
I'm Tim Rhodes, the hotel's
owner and Claire's father.

1:08:39.349 --> 1:08:40.215
Oh, yes.

1:08:40.217 --> 1:08:41.249
Well, good to meet you, sir.

1:08:41.251 --> 1:08:42.550
You must be very proud.

1:08:42.552 --> 1:08:44.485
Now Claire's a very
impressive person.

1:08:44.487 --> 1:08:45.887
She certainly is.

1:08:45.889 --> 1:08:48.389
May I ask what brings you
to town for the holidays?

1:08:48.391 --> 1:08:51.059
I'm up to see the big
show tomorrow.

1:08:51.061 --> 1:08:53.862
You came up from Vegas
to see our variety show?

1:08:53.864 --> 1:08:55.063
That's right.

1:08:55.065 --> 1:08:58.266
I wanted to see Claire in action
for myself.

1:08:58.268 --> 1:08:59.167
Right.

1:09:00.237 --> 1:09:01.903
Right.

1:09:01.905 --> 1:09:03.171
Um, okay great.

1:09:03.173 --> 1:09:05.006
I'll let Claire know
you're here.

1:09:05.008 --> 1:09:08.376
I just realized I need to talk
to her as well.

1:09:14.217 --> 1:09:15.450
Claire?

1:09:15.452 --> 1:09:17.185
Dad, what's up?

1:09:17.187 --> 1:09:19.420
I just met Andre Hudson.

1:09:19.422 --> 1:09:20.455
Oh.

1:09:27.731 --> 1:09:29.530
Care to tell me
what's going on?

1:09:29.532 --> 1:09:30.732
[sighs]

1:09:30.734 --> 1:09:33.601
Dad, I'm... I'm sorry.

1:09:33.603 --> 1:09:36.771
I, um, I didn't want to say
anything before it was official.

1:09:36.773 --> 1:09:40.975
Then I was going to tell you
and things just got crazy.

1:09:40.977 --> 1:09:45.046
But um, I think I'm about to get
a job offer running

1:09:45.048 --> 1:09:51.119
the new variety show at The
Emperor Resorts in Las Vegas.

1:09:51.121 --> 1:09:53.755
Oh.

1:09:53.757 --> 1:09:59.661
Okay. I guess,
uh, congratulations.

1:09:59.663 --> 1:10:01.562
But, I thought, you loved
working here.

1:10:01.564 --> 1:10:03.398
Oh, I know.
I... I do.

1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:07.769
But I told you I... I really
love working live events

1:10:07.771 --> 1:10:10.972
and The Emperor is like
the premiere place to do that.

1:10:10.974 --> 1:10:13.474
I'd be working for and with
the best in the business.

1:10:13.476 --> 1:10:16.110
That is my true passion, Dad.

1:10:16.112 --> 1:10:18.780
You'd really leave here
to do that?

1:10:18.782 --> 1:10:20.315
Yeah.

1:10:20.317 --> 1:10:22.250
How many times have you told me
that you tried to make this

1:10:22.252 --> 1:10:24.452
a regular music destination
back in the day

1:10:24.454 --> 1:10:25.853
and it... it failed.

1:10:25.855 --> 1:10:27.689
Just too hard to compete
with Vegas,

1:10:27.691 --> 1:10:28.623
Reno, San Francisco.

1:10:28.625 --> 1:10:30.158
I know, I know, but...

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:32.460
And don't forget I wasn't even
supposed to be here originally.

1:10:32.462 --> 1:10:35.163
I... I thought I'd be off
managing Wild Lynx.

1:10:35.165 --> 1:10:36.264
Right.

1:10:36.266 --> 1:10:37.932
You're right.

1:10:37.934 --> 1:10:42.670
I just wish... I just wish we
could've talked about it first.

1:10:42.672 --> 1:10:44.172
We work so well together.

1:10:44.174 --> 1:10:47.208
I thought this was going to be
your future.

1:10:48.712 --> 1:10:49.777
Dad.

1:10:52.315 --> 1:10:53.181
Um...

1:10:53.183 --> 1:10:54.682
It's okay, it's okay.

1:10:54.684 --> 1:10:58.853
You do what you need to do
and uh, we'll talk more later.

1:10:58.855 --> 1:11:00.355
Okay?

1:11:00.357 --> 1:11:01.222
Uh...

1:11:02.525 --> 1:11:03.391
Okay.

1:11:06.730 --> 1:11:07.795

1:11:12.502 --> 1:11:14.569
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:11:14.571 --> 1:11:19.574
Hey Otis. I'm fine, just having
a bit of a dilemma.

1:11:19.576 --> 1:11:21.175
Anything I can do to help?

1:11:21.177 --> 1:11:24.912
Have you ever had to choose
between two great options?

1:11:24.914 --> 1:11:26.547
Only every day.

1:11:26.549 --> 1:11:27.915
People ask me all the time

1:11:27.917 --> 1:11:29.884
"Otis, what side of the line
is your favorite?"

1:11:29.886 --> 1:11:31.586
And I say both can be great

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:32.987
depending on what
you're looking for.

1:11:32.989 --> 1:11:34.722
One day you might want
to catch some rays

1:11:34.724 --> 1:11:36.524
in Venice Beach in California

1:11:36.526 --> 1:11:39.327
or the next go hiking in
the Spring Mountains in Nevada.

1:11:39.329 --> 1:11:40.862
Neither one's better.

1:11:40.864 --> 1:11:44.599
All that really matters is who's
going to be there with you.

1:18:23.866 --> 1:18:30.471
[cheering and applause]

1:18:32.074 --> 1:18:36.777
Hi sweetheart.
Thank you for coming.

1:18:36.779 --> 1:18:38.913
So great. She was...

1:18:38.915 --> 1:18:40.414
So glad.

1:18:40.416 --> 1:18:42.383
Ricki, fabulous set.

1:18:42.385 --> 1:18:45.953
Girl, I haven't had that much
fun on stage in a long time.

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:50.157
Speaking of fun, put in a good
word for me with Jackson.

1:18:50.159 --> 1:18:52.493
Okay.

1:18:52.495 --> 1:18:54.728
Honey, that show was
off the charts.

1:18:54.730 --> 1:18:57.798
You did such a great job.

1:18:57.800 --> 1:18:59.567
Unbelievable night.

1:18:59.569 --> 1:19:02.403
Thanks. You too, really.

1:19:02.405 --> 1:19:04.238
Where's Ryan?

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.773
He's around somewhere.

1:19:05.775 --> 1:19:07.741
But hey. I was just
asking Jackson

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:09.977
if he'd like to come open
for us next month.

1:19:09.979 --> 1:19:13.013
Told him I had to check
with the boss first, of course.

1:19:13.015 --> 1:19:14.315
I obviously said yes.

1:19:14.317 --> 1:19:15.649
[laughs]

1:19:15.651 --> 1:19:18.252
I am so happy for you.

1:19:18.254 --> 1:19:19.687
You deserve it.

1:19:20.690 --> 1:19:24.158
Thank you for getting me out of
my comfort zone,

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:25.926
putting me out on that stage.

1:19:25.928 --> 1:19:27.261
Can I talk to you for a second?

1:19:27.263 --> 1:19:28.362
Excuse us.

1:19:28.364 --> 1:19:29.430
Yeah.

1:19:30.700 --> 1:19:31.765
Dad I...

1:19:31.767 --> 1:19:35.769
Sweetheart, I am so proud
of you.

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:37.171
Thank you.

1:19:37.173 --> 1:19:40.541
I got to say, what you' managed
to do in this last week

1:19:40.543 --> 1:19:44.445
made me realize that back in the
day I didn't have your touch.

1:19:44.447 --> 1:19:46.280
And it got me wondering.

1:19:46.282 --> 1:19:47.982
About what?

1:19:47.984 --> 1:19:50.718
Look, trying to make
this place

1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:54.688
into a regular live
entertainment operation
would be difficult.

1:19:54.690 --> 1:19:59.360
And some people would say "if
it ain't broke, don't fix it."

1:19:59.362 --> 1:20:02.663
But I can see now that if anyone
can do it, it's you.

1:20:02.665 --> 1:20:05.699
So, if you'd want to stay

1:20:05.701 --> 1:20:08.569
I'll help you with whatever
you need to make it happen.

1:20:08.571 --> 1:20:12.840
Dad, I...

1:20:12.842 --> 1:20:14.642
Wow.

1:20:14.644 --> 1:20:16.410
Incredible show, Claire.

1:20:16.412 --> 1:20:17.545
Um...

1:20:17.547 --> 1:20:19.480
You know, I knew how talented
you were

1:20:19.482 --> 1:20:24.018
but I have to say this
absolutely blew me away.

1:20:24.020 --> 1:20:25.252
I'll let you two catch up.

1:20:25.254 --> 1:20:28.022
-Andre, nice to meet you.
-Good to meet you.

1:20:28.024 --> 1:20:29.223
Thank you.

1:20:29.225 --> 1:20:30.824
That... that means the world
coming from you.

1:20:30.826 --> 1:20:34.228
Look Claire, the job
is obviously yours.

1:20:34.230 --> 1:20:35.696
Now we would be
absolutely thrilled

1:20:35.698 --> 1:20:37.898
to have you join us
in Vegas.

1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:39.433
So, what do you say?

1:20:43.372 --> 1:20:47.575
[strumming guitar softly]

1:20:47.577 --> 1:20:50.511
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:20:50.513 --> 1:20:51.879
What are you playing?

1:20:51.881 --> 1:20:54.715
Nothing. Just an idea.

1:20:54.717 --> 1:20:56.250
Already writing another song.

1:20:56.252 --> 1:20:58.285
When you're in the flow.

1:20:59.689 --> 1:21:01.522
Congrats on the job.

1:21:01.524 --> 1:21:03.290
You're going to be great.

1:21:03.292 --> 1:21:05.259
Yeah, thanks.

1:21:05.261 --> 1:21:11.565
I, um, I would've been great.

1:21:11.567 --> 1:21:13.300
Sorry?

1:21:13.302 --> 1:21:15.903
I turned it down.

1:21:15.905 --> 1:21:17.771
Claire, are you crazy?

1:21:17.773 --> 1:21:20.908
Maybe. Yeah, probably.
Yes.

1:21:20.910 --> 1:21:22.476
I don't know.

1:21:22.478 --> 1:21:25.646
The Emperor would have been
an incredible experience.

1:21:25.648 --> 1:21:28.115
I would've immediately gotten
to do everything I dreamed of.

1:21:28.117 --> 1:21:35.089
But this hotel is my family.

1:21:35.091 --> 1:21:36.790
My home.

1:21:36.792 --> 1:21:38.926
And Dad even said he'd be
willing to help make

1:21:38.928 --> 1:21:40.494
live music happen
here again.

1:21:40.496 --> 1:21:43.430
So, if there's a chance
I could turn this place

1:21:43.432 --> 1:21:46.500
into a destination that big acts
want to come to year round.

1:21:46.502 --> 1:21:51.905
I mean, I'd be crazier
not to try, right?

1:21:51.907 --> 1:21:53.440
[laughs]

1:21:53.442 --> 1:21:59.513
And then who knows what this
place could be like in 10 years.

1:21:59.515 --> 1:22:03.183
I'm excited to find out.

1:22:03.185 --> 1:22:05.686
And I'd be lying if I said

1:22:05.688 --> 1:22:08.589
that was the only thing
keeping me here.

1:22:08.591 --> 1:22:10.457
Well, I'd be lying if I said

1:22:10.459 --> 1:22:13.360
writing was the only thing
keeping me here.

1:22:17.266 --> 1:22:18.699
I don't think those two kids

1:22:18.701 --> 1:22:21.669
at The Wishing Tree
all those years ago

1:22:21.671 --> 1:22:25.039
could've imagined that this is
where they would end up.

1:22:25.041 --> 1:22:28.108
[laughs]

1:22:29.145 --> 1:22:32.813
If I could make one
wish right now,

1:22:32.815 --> 1:22:36.183
I'd wish to be here with you.

1:22:36.185 --> 1:22:38.952
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

1:22:38.954 --> 1:22:41.522
Merry Christmas, Ryan.

1:22:41.524 --> 1:22:43.524
Merry Christmas, Claire.
