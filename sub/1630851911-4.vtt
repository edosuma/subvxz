00:11.120 --> 00:15.160
BASED ON AN UNSOLVED CRIME

00:16.240 --> 00:21.720
FEBRUARY 28, 1986 - 5:10 P.M.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.360
Have a nice weekend, Stig.

00:24.320 --> 00:27.160
Have a great time in Idre.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.000
Hello, Engström.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.400
When are you coming home?

00:49.040 --> 00:51.640
-Late.
-But we're leaving for Idre tomorrow.

00:52.240 --> 00:55.280
-Have you packed?
-No, I'll pack when I get home.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.120
-Anything else?
-No, finish working.

01:58.880 --> 01:59.880
Hey, Christer.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.120
We need to speak to you.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.720
Sure, come on in.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.880
It's probably better
if you come to the station.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.160
-It's regarding the Palme murder.
-But I haven't murdered Olof Palme.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.360
-We still want to speak to you, so…
-Do I have a choice?

02:14.440 --> 02:15.600
It's voluntary.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.920
-How could it be voluntary?
-They practically had nothing.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.520
One witness owned a gambling club
and dealt drugs.

02:24.600 --> 02:29.320
In the 12th interview, he hinted that
Pettersson had been at the murder scene.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.480
He realized that was what the cops wanted.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.120
That's what happens
when you have a 50 million reward.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.360
Yes, exactly!

02:36.440 --> 02:40.160
The other witness was one
of Christer's old drug buddies.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.840
He was at Grand,
but too high to remember anything,

02:43.920 --> 02:47.640
until the eighth interview,
when he suddenly remembered Christer.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.400
-How convenient.
-Right?

02:49.480 --> 02:52.000
-So what happened?
-Expressen happened.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.160
They put it on the front page.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.720
Then it couldn't be stopped.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.600
41-YEAR-OLD SWEDE
ARRESTED FOR THE PALME MURDER

03:31.680 --> 03:35.480
Sorry, Thomas. The articles are gone.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.320
They must have disappeared when I moved.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.600
That's too bad.

03:38.680 --> 03:39.920
STIG HAD EXPERIENCE WITH WEAPONS

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Yeah.

03:42.320 --> 03:44.320
What book are you writing?

03:45.800 --> 03:47.360
It's about Stig.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.640
I think he was the one
who shot Olof Palme.

03:59.440 --> 04:00.840
Hello? Margareta?

04:02.080 --> 04:03.120
No.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.880
Stig didn't kill Palme.
He couldn't have done something like that.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.560
He may have disliked Palme,
but he wasn't the only one.

04:13.160 --> 04:14.360
No, that's true.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.880
But he did like politics.

04:18.840 --> 04:22.240
Politicians have influence,
and Stig wanted that himself.

04:23.640 --> 04:27.720
He did venture into politics,
so it wasn't just all talk.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.600
It's time to vote.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.920
Does the meeting accept the proposal?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.600
-Yes.
-I find that to be the case.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.760
We hereby welcome Stig Engström

04:38.840 --> 04:42.880
as a board member of the Moderate Party's
Municipal Association in Täby.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.000
Congratulations.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.480
Margareta, this is just the beginning.
I can promise you that.

04:57.560 --> 05:02.360
I have plans for how the party will win
their own majority in the next election.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.360
Wow! But don't hope for too much.

05:05.440 --> 05:10.080
I already have ideas for elderly care,
the bureau for public roads and…

05:10.760 --> 05:14.120
the industrial policy.
These things must be addressed.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.240
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.720
In five years,

05:20.800 --> 05:24.160
I'll be the Moderate Party's
strongman here.

05:25.560 --> 05:29.240
-Maybe take it one step at a time.
-Don't you believe me?

05:29.760 --> 05:30.720
Hi, there!

05:31.280 --> 05:32.520
-Come in.
-Thank you.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.400
-Hi, Margareta.
-Hi.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.400
I heard about your promotion
within the Moderate Party.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.440
Stig, we need you.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.280
Your party is about
to make a terrible mistake.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.000
-You're our last hope.
-Is it that bad?

05:54.040 --> 05:57.120
For thousands of kids in Täby,

05:57.200 --> 06:03.120
Ytterbyskolan symbolizes security,
knowledge, and community.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.680
With its beautiful 1920s facade,

06:06.760 --> 06:11.320
it's a beloved landmark
for all of Täby's residents.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.960
And the Moderate municipal council
wants to tear it down.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.400
SAVE YTTERBYSKOLAN!

06:17.480 --> 06:21.560
Stig Engström from the Moderate Party,
what's going on?

06:24.520 --> 06:29.160
I don't think that you need to be worried.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.200
Our party doesn't only stand

06:31.280 --> 06:35.040
for the preservation
of Swedish cultural heritage,

06:35.600 --> 06:40.640
but also for victory of reason
over ignorance.

06:41.360 --> 06:46.000
And I can promise you
that I will make the party see reason.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.120
Thank you.

07:00.160 --> 07:01.520
Let's start again.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.120
-When did you go into the city?
-I've already told you that.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.040
That's the third time you've asked that.

07:08.120 --> 07:12.360
-Do you want your lawyer?
-Lawyer? Then I'll never get out of here.

07:12.440 --> 07:13.600
Screw him.

07:21.880 --> 07:25.040
What's going on? What's this all about?

07:29.800 --> 07:34.320
We're notifying you that
you're a suspect in the Palme murder.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.000
You're joking, right?

07:43.320 --> 07:45.080
I liked Palme.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.600
I thought highly of him.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.880
Would you be willing
to participate in a lineup?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.760
Yeah, sure. No problem.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.640
A lineup? How would that work?

08:02.920 --> 08:06.440
You line up the suspect
and a few similar-looking people.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.240
-Mrs. Palme stands behind a mirror, and--
-No, not a chance.

08:12.160 --> 08:15.440
I won't stand there
with that vile individual.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.080
-No, but--
-I won't deal with the police. Not again.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.240
They've been lying to me
and manipulating me since Olof died.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.360
I trusted them, and they let me down.

08:28.360 --> 08:32.720
-This could be crucial for--
-I can't be that close to that man.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.520
I know…

08:36.720 --> 08:38.200
but there's no other way.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.040
Okay, let's do that.

08:48.920 --> 08:54.280
I have arranged for Mrs. Palme
to see the lineup on a videotape.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.600
-Where?
-At our place, the attorney's office.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.440
-With you, I presume?
-Yes.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.400
-And the suspect's lawyer.
-No. Only you, no one else.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.320
I know what happens.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.160
It will leak to the press.
They've been harassing us for three years.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.960
Yes.

09:14.520 --> 09:15.920
We'll do it that way.

09:18.840 --> 09:23.600
In order to enable the construction
of these commercial properties,

09:23.680 --> 09:25.120
we, the Moderates,

09:25.200 --> 09:28.600
believe it necessary
to tear down Ytterbyskolan.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.120
No.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.320
Thank you.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.120
Our next speaker is also a Moderate.
The floor is yours, Stig Engström.

09:44.800 --> 09:48.440
Stig!

10:01.600 --> 10:03.560
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.800
My friends. My dear friends…

10:07.920 --> 10:10.440
this is not Moderate politics.

10:11.640 --> 10:12.680
To…

10:12.760 --> 10:16.960
To tear down an architecturally designed
beautiful old school?

10:17.880 --> 10:23.840
We're supposed to stand for tradition,
for culture, for education.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.560
No, Ytterbyskolan…

10:28.440 --> 10:29.400
it will remain.

10:30.680 --> 10:32.360
I'll make sure of that.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.680
Hey!

10:52.480 --> 10:55.120
How's the lineup going?

10:55.200 --> 10:58.000
-Mixed results.
-Is it enough to detain him?

10:59.480 --> 11:02.200
Doubtful. It all comes down to Lisbeth.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.440
-Is that the lineup?
-Yes.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.320
What a gang. They don't even look alike.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.320
Well, yes, to each other.
It's 11 cops and Christer Pettersson.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.320
Yeah, yeah.

11:22.920 --> 11:26.120
Is it one of the suspects
we discussed last fall?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.200
That's right.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.000
-The Yugoslav?
-Yes-- No, it's not him.

11:31.080 --> 11:35.560
So it's the other one?
The alcoholic from some suburb?

11:37.800 --> 11:38.840
Is it him?

11:39.360 --> 11:40.400
Just answer me.

11:41.480 --> 11:42.520
Yes, it is.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.440
It's easy to tell who the alcoholic is.

11:53.920 --> 11:54.920
Don't look at me.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.080
I don't want you
to stand there and stare at me.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.400
That's enough.

12:48.040 --> 12:53.600
-What does Mrs. Palme think?
-The alcoholic best fits my description.

12:54.120 --> 12:54.960
Number eight.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.640
Number nine and number six
also fit the description well, but…

13:03.520 --> 13:05.080
they're not as scary.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.000
Yes.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.040
What did she say?

13:21.720 --> 13:22.920
What does that mean?

13:25.160 --> 13:26.840
Interpret? What do you mean?

13:29.680 --> 13:32.080
Okay, then. I don't see a problem.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.960
That's enough. Good. Thank you.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.280
Lisbeth picked out Christer Pettersson.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.840
-We can arrest him.
-Yes! Great!

13:46.280 --> 13:49.480
Okay, so Lisbeth picked him out.

13:49.560 --> 13:50.840
What's the problem?

13:51.440 --> 13:54.320
The problem? She knew
who she was supposed to pick.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.840
The entire lineup was a farce,
a legal scandal.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.840
Okay, but the book is about Stig.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.240
-What did it mean for him?
-So…

14:04.320 --> 14:07.800
Stig was about to become
something of a national hero.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.440
Several journalists felt
that Stig's testimony was silenced.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.360
One book said that Palme
was murdered by Swedish police.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.920
It was based on Stig telling the truth.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.680
Lisbeth's credibility depended on him.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.720
He said that she was
coherent after the murder.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.040
Now he had a chance to
get Pettersson convicted for the murder.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.680
It was Stig's greatest moment.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.840
It's now been three years
since that February evening on Sveavägen…

14:38.920 --> 14:42.320
Enter the 41-year-old,
a bit dazed and confused…

14:42.400 --> 14:44.720
The interest from the media and public,

14:44.800 --> 14:48.360
in what has been called
"the trial of the century," is huge.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.240
It's time for Stig Engström's testimony.
Please begin.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.160
Thank you.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.400
Well, you know what this session is about.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.240
It's regarding
certain observations you made

15:01.320 --> 15:04.800
on the evening of February 28, 1986.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.040
Were you working at Skandia then?

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Yes, I was.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.920
At what time did you clock out?

15:13.160 --> 15:16.880
According to the time clock, it was…

15:18.200 --> 15:20.880
11:20 p.m.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.360
But when it was checked the next day,

15:24.440 --> 15:28.840
the clock turned out to be 60 seconds off.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.960
So I clocked out at 11:21 p.m.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.760
-At 11:21 p.m.?
-Yes.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.000
How did she seem at the time?
Mrs. Palme, that is.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.120
She seemed a bit confused and…

15:45.800 --> 15:49.400
flustered, but you could talk to her.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.440
Did she say what had happened?

15:51.520 --> 15:54.600
No, I asked. I asked in which direction.

15:55.200 --> 15:59.800
Then she pointed towards
the tunnel on Tunnelgatan.

16:00.600 --> 16:03.520
Then I asked what he was wearing.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.240
Then she hesitated for a moment,

16:06.320 --> 16:11.040
say three seconds,
and said, "A blue quilted jacket."

16:11.680 --> 16:15.000
A few seconds later, she said,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.280
"They've shot me as well."

16:18.080 --> 16:21.320
And during this time,
how was Mrs. Palme acting?

16:21.840 --> 16:26.480
She was grateful
for any help she got at this point.

16:27.440 --> 16:29.280
The prosecutor, Jörgen Almblad.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.040
Thank you.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.320
I have one question.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.840
You have, during an interview
with the police,

16:35.920 --> 16:40.120
said that you felt that Lisbeth Palme
was in "controlled shock."

16:40.200 --> 16:41.520
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.840
By that, I mean that…

16:45.840 --> 16:48.240
she was, given the circumstances…

16:49.200 --> 16:51.400
if you know what I mean, responsive.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.120
Witness interview with Gösta Söderström.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.440
The defense may begin.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.800
Can you start by telling us
what your role was, and…

17:10.320 --> 17:12.680
what observations you made at the scene?

17:13.320 --> 17:16.240
I was task leader at the murder scene.

17:16.320 --> 17:20.160
I was in charge
of collecting physical descriptions,

17:21.600 --> 17:25.480
setting up cordons,
and organizing searches.

17:25.560 --> 17:30.080
At the crime scene,
there was a totally hysterical woman.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.080
She was distraught and exhausted.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.240
She was screaming,
"You have to save my husband!"

17:37.840 --> 17:41.120
That was the only thing
you could make out in her state.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.440
I then tried to speak to her and failed.

17:46.520 --> 17:49.680
I made another attempt, and, yeah…

17:50.480 --> 17:55.040
during the second attempt,
I couldn't get through to her at all.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.880
Eventually, during the third attempt,
she screamed…

18:00.800 --> 18:03.760
"Are you out of your mind?
Don't you recognize me?"

18:03.840 --> 18:07.960
"I'm Lisbeth Palme,
and that's Olof lying there."

18:08.720 --> 18:12.880
-Have you been following the trial?
-Yes, very closely.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.720
So why are you just now coming forward?

18:17.240 --> 18:20.520
Because I read this in the newspaper…

18:23.760 --> 18:27.000
"…that Mrs. Palme was
in such shock after the shooting

18:27.080 --> 18:31.200
that her powers of observations
were diminished is not true."

18:32.040 --> 18:34.560
"This was contradicted by a witness

18:34.640 --> 18:38.360
who spoke to Lisbeth
and got a description of the murderer."

18:41.240 --> 18:43.440
This is what I just can't accept.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.320
This is complete madness.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.680
I have my own suspicions
about which witness said this.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.160
Yes.

18:54.680 --> 18:58.280
Because it's probably
the move of an "elephant,"

18:58.800 --> 19:01.280
to use Holmér's terminology.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.240
Hello, Stig.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.080
-Nice to see you.
-That was some speech.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.000
Thank you.

19:10.640 --> 19:13.120
The school's been saved.
It's just as well.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.800
We can probably build
those properties somewhere else.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.840
Hey…

19:22.840 --> 19:24.240
I misjudged you.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.280
I knew that you were a failure

19:29.200 --> 19:30.680
and a drunk,

19:31.600 --> 19:34.320
but I didn't realize
that you were a traitor.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.600
If I have--

19:37.680 --> 19:40.880
I'm sure you know
what we do with traitors in politics.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.720
-But with the voters…
-We want nothing to do with you.

19:46.640 --> 19:50.840
If I ever see you here again,
I'll have you thrown out of the party.

19:58.520 --> 20:02.680
YTTERBYSKOLAN REMAINS FOR NOW
COUNCIL DECISION APPLAUDED

20:35.400 --> 20:38.760
A unanimous Court of Appeal
today announced the acquittal

20:38.840 --> 20:41.600
in the case of the Prime Minister's murder
almost four years ago.

20:41.680 --> 20:46.520
Christer Pettersson was convicted
last summer by a divided district court…

20:46.600 --> 20:48.560
-Will you celebrate?
-Yes, as you can see.

20:48.640 --> 20:52.880
…when the three lay judges went against
the lawyers and voted for a conviction.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.680
-Here!
-Christer!

20:54.760 --> 20:57.240
That the conviction was changed

20:57.320 --> 20:59.080
was therefore no surprise.

20:59.160 --> 21:02.120
Unlike the district court,
the Court of Appeal

21:02.200 --> 21:05.280
didn't find Lisbeth's
identification of Pettersson

21:05.360 --> 21:08.520
sufficient for a conviction.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.680
Why couldn't they just convict him?

21:12.000 --> 21:14.120
So there'd be an end to this misery.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.400
No, Stig didn't lie. He didn't.

21:26.280 --> 21:27.400
Well…

21:27.480 --> 21:32.160
He said a lot of different things.
A lot of things didn't add up.

21:32.680 --> 21:34.120
It wasn't like that.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.840
He told it exactly as it was.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.160
Okay, but…

21:39.760 --> 21:43.480
Margareta, do you know
of an organization called Stay-behind?

21:44.520 --> 21:47.240
No. What's that?

21:47.320 --> 21:49.480
It's a resistance movement.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.280
Did Stig belong to it?

21:53.280 --> 21:56.960
No, I would've known about it.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.440
So Stig's wife
had never heard of Stay-behind?

22:03.000 --> 22:04.480
No, that's what she said.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.920
-Do you think she lied?
-I have no idea.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.480
I don't think so.

22:10.240 --> 22:14.520
Maybe you should consider
dropping Stay-behind.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.560
Yes, I've considered that.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.080
You know,

22:20.160 --> 22:24.280
I think that the entire thing
is beginning to feel pretty shaky.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.640
-What?
-The Stig business.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.360
Are you sure he's the murderer?

22:29.440 --> 22:33.280
-Why else would he lie?
-He was addicted to attention.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.360
Maybe he lied to show off.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.480
-Is that your theory?
-Why not?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.560
Around nine, when Palme
went into the movie theater,

22:41.640 --> 22:44.680
Stig was out having dinner. We know that.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.000
But he lied and said that he didn't.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.800
How did he show off by doing that?

22:50.280 --> 22:54.680
Stig left Skandia at 11:19 p.m.,
just in time to shoot Palme.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.760
But he claimed that he left at 11:21.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.720
How did he show off by lying about that?

23:01.800 --> 23:07.480
And the man that the witnesses saw running
on David Bagares gata after the murder…

23:07.560 --> 23:13.440
The guy with a long coat and wrist bag?
Do you really believe that wasn't Stig?

23:14.440 --> 23:18.520
That two men fitting that description
were running around there?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.120
With a wrist bag?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.080
But what was his motive?

23:26.640 --> 23:31.800
I think he wanted to kill a tyrant,
as revenge for his own failed life.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.560
He wanted to mean something.

23:34.680 --> 23:35.760
And the weapon?

23:35.840 --> 23:38.600
As far as I know,
he didn't have access to one.

23:39.120 --> 23:42.480
-Did he even know how to fire one?
-I don't know.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.600
No.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.560
Until you know that…

23:48.200 --> 23:50.080
we don't have a book, Thomas.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.720
-Who is he?
-He introduced himself as Sven Anér.

23:59.680 --> 24:04.440
Yet another press corps representative.
Soon I'll have to get a press secretary.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.360
-There you go.
-Thanks.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.160
Well, how can I… I be of service?

24:12.240 --> 24:16.800
As you know, due to the trial
against Christer Pettersson,

24:16.880 --> 24:19.640
the preliminary investigation
was made public.

24:19.720 --> 24:23.400
-Yes.
-That includes the interviews with you.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.320
That's nice.

24:26.320 --> 24:27.360
Well…

24:28.200 --> 24:32.640
I honestly can't figure out
what you were up to that evening.

24:34.320 --> 24:36.040
First of all, the time frame.

24:37.480 --> 24:42.600
According to Skandia's head of security,
you left the building at 11:19 p.m.,

24:42.680 --> 24:47.440
but in all your interviews,
you claim that you left at 11:21 p.m.

24:47.520 --> 24:49.600
-Yes, no--
-Why is that?

24:50.200 --> 24:55.480
You've probably misunderstood.
It's supposed to be 11:21 p.m.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.320
Not according to security.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.320
Okay, but it was 11:21 p.m.

25:03.120 --> 25:08.960
Then you claim that you first helped
administer first aid to Palme

25:09.040 --> 25:12.720
and then showed the police
which way the murderer went.

25:12.800 --> 25:16.280
Then you ran after them
to give them the description.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.440
That's correct.

25:18.120 --> 25:22.360
But according to the people
who we know tried to save Palme's life,

25:22.440 --> 25:24.200
you weren't there at all.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.040
They claim they never saw you.

25:28.040 --> 25:32.840
No one saw you run after the police.
No one saw you return or…

25:32.920 --> 25:36.680
No one saw you
at the scene of the murder at all.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.760
If you're trying to catch me in a lie,
I can guarantee--

25:39.840 --> 25:44.680
Then you claim that a witness
spoke to a police officer

25:44.760 --> 25:47.960
and gave him a description matching yours.

25:48.480 --> 25:53.240
-Yes.
-But neither of them could be identified.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.760
The task leader claims
that he never saw you.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.200
He wasn't the sharpest mind on the force.

26:01.280 --> 26:06.320
And if you tried to save Olof Palme,

26:06.400 --> 26:09.400
why didn't you say so
during the first questioning?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.480
I don't have time for this.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.640
-You should want to sort these things out.
-Really?

26:14.720 --> 26:17.840
I could send you a letter
with the questions.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.280
Yes, you do that.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.920
-Thank you for seeing me.
-No problem.

26:27.800 --> 26:28.920
Dear Stig,

26:29.000 --> 26:31.600
I have spoken to people
who were at the scene

26:31.680 --> 26:35.600
and have reached the conclusion
that you weren't there.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.600
There's a long chain of events
that you want us to believe.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.240
That you helped Palme, spoke to Lisbeth…

26:43.320 --> 26:47.960
Dear Sven, you're not only questioning
whether I was at the scene at the time,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.320
but claim that I have made things up.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.440
No one that knows me
would ever make such a claim.

26:55.200 --> 27:00.000
-I was most definitely present.
-Why make things up? I don't know.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.760
The moment the shots were fired,
you disappeared.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.080
Twenty minutes later,
you turned up at Skandia.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.040
What were you doing during that time?

27:11.840 --> 27:13.880
This is a very serious letter.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.120
I just want the truth.

27:17.720 --> 27:21.560
I want to help you out
of the dead end you find yourself in.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.000
We'll take the rest.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.440
Are you done? Come and eat.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.760
It's tasty.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.800
Tomorrow, it will be six years.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.640
-Since when?
-Since Palme was shot.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.400
I'll be damned. Six years?

27:52.480 --> 27:54.560
They'll never catch the bastard.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.640
-You don't think so?
-Not a chance.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.240
Sweden's a damn banana republic.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.560
I was no fan of Olof Palme, but…

28:03.200 --> 28:06.240
it's a scandal that
they can't catch the lunatic.

28:06.320 --> 28:11.240
-It's a wound that'll never heal.
-No. Sweden will never get over it.

28:11.320 --> 28:12.360
What do you think, Stig?

28:13.200 --> 28:16.720
What does the star witness say?
Did Björn Borg shoot him?

28:18.040 --> 28:19.240
What do you mean?

28:19.320 --> 28:22.720
You're pretty good
at letting your imagination run wild.

28:23.640 --> 28:27.080
-Are you questioning my credibility?
-I'd never do that.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.400
-No.
-Let's change the subject.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.800
Because the Swedish press corps doesn't.

28:31.880 --> 28:36.120
Do they remember who you are?
You haven't been in the papers in years.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.720
-Can't you--
-Take that back! Apologize!

28:38.800 --> 28:41.400
-Don't have a heart attack.
-Stig…

28:41.480 --> 28:44.200
I'm tired of your insults.
You can go to hell!

28:44.280 --> 28:45.680
-But…
-We're leaving.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.480
We're not going to be around that asshole.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.240
-Come!
-Yes, I'm…

28:50.320 --> 28:51.440
But, Stig!

28:52.840 --> 28:54.680
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.280
-That was a bit unnecessary.
-Yeah.

28:57.880 --> 29:01.440
I'm going to wipe that grin off his face!

29:01.520 --> 29:02.800
Can you calm down?

29:02.880 --> 29:05.600
He's always picked on me, but that's over.

29:06.240 --> 29:09.520
That bastard
won't set foot in our house again.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
-Can we wait and decide that tomorrow?
-Like hell!

29:12.680 --> 29:14.360
We don't need that scum!

29:14.440 --> 29:16.720
We have real friends, who respect us!

29:16.800 --> 29:20.640
Stig, we don't.
We don't have any other friends.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.760
We haven't been invited over
by anyone for years.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.840
I want that fucker to crawl
on his bare knees and apologize!

29:27.920 --> 29:30.040
I haven't been forgotten.
That's a goddamn lie.

29:39.800 --> 29:43.360
But if you ever want an interview,
just give me a call.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.400
Thank you. Bye.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.920
Yes, hello, my name is Stig Engström.

29:52.000 --> 29:56.400
No, I just wanted to see if you
were interested in doing an interview.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.720
My name is Stig Engström,
known as the Skandia Man.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.240
But if you ever want an interview, just…

30:04.400 --> 30:05.840
give me a call, so…

30:05.920 --> 30:09.600
Hi, it's Stig Engström. I called.
Yes, the Skandia Man.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.760
I… Hello?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.160
Hello?

30:21.840 --> 30:22.720
Hello, Stig!

30:22.800 --> 30:24.240
-Welcome. Come in.
-Yes.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
-Come in.
-Nice of you to call.

30:26.400 --> 30:30.240
I thought that it could be interesting
for your readers

30:30.320 --> 30:32.880
to get a thorough account
of the Palme murder.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.120
-Yes.
-Skydd & Säkerhet is a trade magazine.

30:36.200 --> 30:39.040
-We don't have many readers.
-That's okay.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.600
As you can see, I have…

30:41.120 --> 30:46.040
put on the exact same clothes that I wore
that evening six years ago, so…

30:46.120 --> 30:48.280
maybe we could take some pictures.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.560
Maybe you'd like some coffee.

30:53.640 --> 30:55.960
-Sure.
-Hang your coat there and I'll…

31:01.280 --> 31:04.480
During later interviews
and the legal process,

31:04.560 --> 31:07.200
the nursing assistant had no memory

31:07.280 --> 31:12.240
of me being there
or that we'd been talking.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.080
What are your thoughts?

31:14.160 --> 31:16.440
I don't know. Perhaps…

31:17.280 --> 31:20.400
a lot of people involved
in this have no desire to…

31:21.320 --> 31:24.120
to speak more than half-truths,
for some reason.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.560
The policeman, Söderström,

31:29.320 --> 31:31.040
has been suspected by many,

31:31.880 --> 31:35.960
and the nursing assistant
who didn't remember me…

31:37.640 --> 31:41.120
may have a professional reputation to…

31:41.200 --> 31:42.240
to protect.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.360
And the murder?

31:54.400 --> 31:57.720
Maybe it wasn't premeditated or planned.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.480
Maybe it was manslaughter…

32:03.240 --> 32:05.960
like an accidental shooting
during an elk hunt.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.440
What do you mean?

32:11.240 --> 32:15.720
Witnesses say that the Palme couple
were approached by a man…

32:16.360 --> 32:18.800
who perhaps recognized them and wanted…

32:19.760 --> 32:24.360
wanted to speak to the famous celebrity
walking down the street.

32:25.160 --> 32:28.080
He didn't only have enemies.

32:28.160 --> 32:29.200
No.

32:32.840 --> 32:36.560
Imagine if the admired Prime Minister…

32:37.160 --> 32:39.280
sneered at you with contempt.

32:40.920 --> 32:44.560
That may piss some of us off.

32:46.360 --> 32:49.840
If the person is carrying a weapon,
then maybe that is…

32:51.800 --> 32:52.840
what he uses.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.000
Your mind races and…

32:57.120 --> 32:58.160
you follow…

32:59.480 --> 33:01.880
Olof and put your hand on his shoulder.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.920
You think, "You bastard." And then "bang."

33:09.680 --> 33:11.360
It's only human, I'm afraid.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.480
Olof!

33:14.040 --> 33:16.000
But also inhuman.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.480
So why hasn't anyone turned him in?

33:21.720 --> 33:23.760
The reward is 50 million.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.520
Maybe the murderer is…

33:31.120 --> 33:32.440
is solitary.

33:33.320 --> 33:34.680
A lone wolf.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.800
Maybe…

33:39.000 --> 33:40.440
the truth is too simple.

33:41.920 --> 33:45.400
Maybe that's why no one wants…
wants to believe it.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.680
-What the hell is this?
-What's that?

34:07.760 --> 34:10.760
You evil bitch,
do you think I'll put up with this?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.120
Get out!

34:12.200 --> 34:13.760
-Who approved it?
-What…?

34:13.840 --> 34:15.320
What is this?

34:15.400 --> 34:16.640
Hey!

34:16.720 --> 34:18.400
-Hey!
-…without telling me.

34:18.480 --> 34:22.400
-So, a brochure?
-Our new pamphlet on vehicle insurance.

34:22.480 --> 34:25.800
And it made you
interrupt Camilla's client meeting?

34:25.880 --> 34:27.760
This has always been my job.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.680
-Now they've made their own material!
-We had to.

34:30.760 --> 34:34.200
-They're breaking our agreement!
-We made an exception!

34:34.280 --> 34:37.640
-You cut me out, time after time!
-Yes, because we have to!

34:37.720 --> 34:39.040
-No!
-You never finish!

34:39.120 --> 34:41.440
-I--
-He draws everything by hand.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.600
-I…
-By hand?

34:42.680 --> 34:45.840
I won't tolerate
this person insulting me, plotting--

34:45.920 --> 34:48.040
I don't have time for this.

34:48.120 --> 34:51.040
She undermines my authority, my position…

34:51.120 --> 34:53.360
Stig!

34:57.480 --> 34:58.720
This isn't working.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.640
I remember when you started here.
You were so happy.

35:06.720 --> 35:07.880
HAPPY RETIREMENT!

35:07.960 --> 35:09.680
You gave all the girls flowers.

35:11.040 --> 35:16.040
And when you became chairman of
the peer association and wrote that song.

35:18.640 --> 35:24.960
We're Skandia's comrades
We'll always put Skandia first

35:26.520 --> 35:28.080
-How did it go?
-No, I…

35:28.160 --> 35:30.040
-Yes!
-I don't remember.

35:32.360 --> 35:36.360
I remember thinking even then
that Skandia was too small for you,

35:36.440 --> 35:38.120
that you'd soon fly on.

35:39.240 --> 35:45.240
You talked about starting your own agency
and finding an outlet for your talent.

35:46.920 --> 35:48.840
It took longer than I thought.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.080
-Here's to you.
-Cheers.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.560
Keep your fingers crossed.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.000
Wow.

36:04.640 --> 36:05.480
Yeah.

36:06.080 --> 36:08.880
-Let's see if I can help you.
-Yeah.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.960
These are all the client files.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.200
As I said…

36:17.480 --> 36:20.400
I can't remember his name.

36:21.120 --> 36:22.160
But…

36:24.480 --> 36:26.840
I know that I had a customer in Täby.

36:26.920 --> 36:27.960
Okay.

36:31.680 --> 36:36.120
Hans Holmér was saying that
they searched all of Sweden for revolvers,

36:36.200 --> 36:38.880
but several of my customers
weren't contacted.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.920
Really?

36:40.000 --> 36:44.600
-Who owned a Magnum revolver?
-Yes, or the equivalent.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.640
That's how it was with this Täby guy.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.920
He had this and that.
He didn't have a license for everything.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.760
Hey, is it this one?

36:58.600 --> 37:00.240
Yes, exactly.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.480
Harry Levin.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.440
-Is it okay if I take a picture of this?
-Yes, sure.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.840
SWEDISH TAX AGENCY
REGISTRATION RECORD

37:51.320 --> 37:52.520
Petronella speaking.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.040
My name is Thomas Pettersson.

37:55.120 --> 37:58.840
I'm investigating Stig Engström.
You know, the Skandia Man.

37:59.800 --> 38:00.840
Okay.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.840
Was Harry Levin your dad?

38:04.560 --> 38:07.840
I'm asking since Harry
had a weapon collection,

38:07.920 --> 38:11.440
and I want to find out
if Engström knew about it.

38:12.320 --> 38:13.800
Dad's weapon collection?

38:15.960 --> 38:19.600
So you think that Stig
got a weapon from my dad

38:20.320 --> 38:21.360
to shoot Palme?

38:21.440 --> 38:24.200
I'm not saying that your dad was involved.

38:24.280 --> 38:27.280
If Stig's the perp,
he probably acted alone.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.000
Who knows?
He may even have stolen the weapon.

38:30.680 --> 38:34.920
But first, I need to figure out
whether it's even worth looking into.

38:39.800 --> 38:41.240
Four of diamonds.

38:45.560 --> 38:46.400
Thank you.

38:46.480 --> 38:47.320
Harry.

38:48.840 --> 38:49.680
Harry?

38:50.280 --> 38:51.400
Ten of spades.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.080
Do you have one for me?

38:58.960 --> 39:00.800
-So you're also the dummy?
-Yes.

39:01.760 --> 39:04.560
Shall we go down
to the holiest of holies and…

39:05.200 --> 39:06.440
have something a bit…

39:08.640 --> 39:09.960
nicer?

39:10.040 --> 39:11.120
That sounds good.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.000
I found a nice bourbon
when I was in Tennessee.

39:16.080 --> 39:16.960
Really?

39:17.040 --> 39:20.520
-Aged in oak barrels.
-It sounds like it's really something.

39:23.920 --> 39:24.960
Come on in.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.640
Wow.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.440
Welcome to the holiest of holies.

39:39.680 --> 39:40.680
Well, well…

39:41.760 --> 39:43.400
Well, Harry…

39:45.160 --> 39:48.560
if there's ever a war,
I know where to hide.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.160
Yeah.

39:51.320 --> 39:55.040
When the Russians come,
we'll turn Täby into one partisan unit.

39:55.640 --> 39:57.080
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

40:02.240 --> 40:03.920
Hey, is that…?

40:04.920 --> 40:08.000
-One of these…?
-That's a .357 Magnum.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.880
This is my personal favorite.

40:13.480 --> 40:16.360
The highway patrol
in the States use these.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.480
It's really powerful.

40:23.640 --> 40:24.520
Hold it.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.520
FEBRUARY 28, 1986 - 8:04 P.M.

40:52.720 --> 40:55.360
I'm not finished yet.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.560
-Can't you finish up on the trip?
-No, this has to be finished tonight.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.800
Fine, it…

41:02.040 --> 41:04.840
-I've saved you meatballs and potatoes.
-Well…

41:05.360 --> 41:07.960
There's no need. I'll grab a bite in town.

41:08.760 --> 41:09.600
Yes.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.080
Heading home?

41:32.680 --> 41:34.360
I'm just going out to eat.

42:44.360 --> 42:47.320
Based on the book The Unlikely Murderer
by Thomas Pettersson.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.840
It has not been proved
that Stig Engström murdered Olof Palme,

42:49.920 --> 42:52.440
but the Swedish police
and Prosecution Authority suspect him.
