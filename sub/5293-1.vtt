00:55.299 --> 00:58.168
Morning, gentlemen. Feet.

01:12.983 --> 01:14.384
So happy you're here.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.680
This is the third
open house and not one bite.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.021
Well...

01:19.922 --> 01:21.323
Don't worry.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.481
l have everything
under control.

01:30.065 --> 01:33.067
Anna, you are a Realtor?

01:34.469 --> 01:38.172
I'm a stager.
l stage apartments for Realtors.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.643
l transform ordinary spaces
into something special.

01:41.777 --> 01:45.280
Most people don't know
what it is they want until l show it to them,

01:45.346 --> 01:46.916
and so many places
need my help.

01:47.015 --> 01:48.065
Oh!

01:48.516 --> 01:50.718
Not the Davenport,
of course.

01:51.987 --> 01:54.889
It's just a very fine line
between elegant and dowdy.

01:54.956 --> 01:57.224
l just think maybe
a quarter-inch higher.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.227
Plus an eighth of an inch?
We'll get it right.

02:00.728 --> 02:01.778
Ow!

02:02.195 --> 02:04.830
You did that on purpose.
Knock it off.

02:06.511 --> 02:09.666
As I'm sure
you're aware,

02:09.669 --> 02:12.739
apartments at the Davenport
don't come up very often,

02:12.806 --> 02:17.043
and we have more than
our share of applicants. So, why you?

02:18.711 --> 02:21.046
l have lived in Boston
my entire life,

02:21.113 --> 02:23.548
and l have always
dreamed of living here.

02:23.917 --> 02:27.720
And thankfully,
l have found somebody who shares that dream,

02:28.788 --> 02:32.057
and l can assure you
that you will not find two people more in sync

02:32.124 --> 02:34.860
with your exceptionally
high standards and,

02:34.927 --> 02:37.195
if l may be so bold,
your taste.

02:38.163 --> 02:39.497
Thank you.

02:44.570 --> 02:45.637
Wow!

02:45.639 --> 02:48.169
With a bit of luck,
we might get some offers.

02:48.172 --> 02:49.473
Come on, Charlie.

02:49.475 --> 02:53.306
You know it's not about luck.
It's about preparation.

02:53.311 --> 02:55.577
Put these in the oven
half an hour before you open

02:55.580 --> 02:57.748
and you'll have
five offers before noon.

02:57.815 --> 02:59.383
No luck needed.

02:59.386 --> 03:02.216
Okay, say it with me.
Three bedrooms.

03:02.219 --> 03:03.269
Three bedrooms.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.921
Concierge.
Concierge.

03:04.989 --> 03:09.293
Full gym and swimming pool
looking over the common. l mean, come on!

03:09.359 --> 03:10.827
Don't get cocky.

03:10.829 --> 03:12.127
Why, you don't think
they liked us?

03:12.130 --> 03:14.499
l like us.
Don't you like us?

03:14.564 --> 03:16.032
We're okay. All right.
Okay.

03:16.099 --> 03:18.901
Here we go.
Ready? And...

03:20.070 --> 03:21.704
Ugly!
Excuse me?

03:22.706 --> 03:25.675
Not you, sweetie.
It's Mr. Sheinbaum

03:25.742 --> 03:27.977
e-mailing me updates
of his double bypass.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.243
I'm glad
l skipped lunch.

03:29.245 --> 03:31.115
No, no, no,
this is good. This is good,

03:31.148 --> 03:34.518
because this way
l don't have to go in. We can go to dinner.

03:34.817 --> 03:37.052
Studio apartment,
two offers already.

03:37.119 --> 03:39.221
That's 'cause
you're a genius.

03:39.224 --> 03:40.720
Have you packed yet?
Your flight's at 11:00.

03:40.723 --> 03:42.353
I'm fine,
just you don't be late.

03:42.355 --> 03:44.389
We've got an 8: rez
and they're strict.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.826
When am l ever late?

03:45.829 --> 03:47.326
When your dad
comes out of the woodwork

03:47.328 --> 03:49.394
demanding to
see his daughter, that's when.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.599
l have to go, Jer.
l haven't seen him in weeks.

03:51.666 --> 03:55.936
Okay, just wouldn't want
you all riled up for our very special dinner.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.105
You know l don't
like surprises.

03:58.173 --> 03:59.874
You'll like this one.

04:02.944 --> 04:04.178
See you.

04:06.981 --> 04:09.450
Oh, Anna,
this is gonna blow your mind!

04:09.516 --> 04:10.566
What'd you buy?

04:10.568 --> 04:11.917
A lot, l got a lot,
but that's not it.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.151
l wanted to
tell you something.

04:13.154 --> 04:15.789
Guess who l saw
coming out of DePrisco's?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.524
Who?
Jeremy!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.257
You did? When?

04:19.325 --> 04:20.426
On the way here.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.059
The cab was stuck
in traffic and l look over,

04:22.062 --> 04:23.427
and he's walking
out of the store

04:23.429 --> 04:25.299
carrying that little red bag.
The bag.

04:25.302 --> 04:27.764
There's only one reason
people go into DePrisco's.

04:27.767 --> 04:30.799
You're gonna have
a better engagement ring than me, you big jerk!

04:30.803 --> 04:32.471
Oh, my God.
Did you know?

04:32.538 --> 04:35.848
No. l mean, l did put
his name on the mailing list a couple months ago

04:35.852 --> 04:36.974
hoping he'd get the hint,
but...

04:36.976 --> 04:39.945
Oh! He got the hint!
l think he got the hint!

04:39.949 --> 04:41.778
Okay, hold on,
we gotta work on your surprise face,

04:41.781 --> 04:42.846
'cause l don't want him
to know l told you...

04:42.848 --> 04:43.898
Okay, ask me.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.784
Ready?
Will you marry me?

04:45.787 --> 04:49.283
What? Are you scared?
That was awful. Try it again.

04:49.287 --> 04:50.688
Okay.
Try it again.

04:51.090 --> 04:52.140
Mmm...

04:52.191 --> 04:55.694
Bigger eyes.
And maybe a little, "Who, me?"

04:57.361 --> 05:00.551
The good news is,
you have time to practice between now and then.

05:01.532 --> 05:04.468
Can l marry you?

05:07.771 --> 05:08.938
No, thank you.

05:09.007 --> 05:10.375
Already married, huh?

05:11.243 --> 05:12.844
Getting engaged.

05:13.110 --> 05:14.911
Engaged?
Dad.

05:15.112 --> 05:18.448
My daughter
is engaged?

05:19.449 --> 05:21.651
GarÃ§on! Champagne!

05:22.183 --> 05:25.484
Let's have a couple
of beers, banana.

05:25.488 --> 05:26.655
I'll get them.

05:28.825 --> 05:30.826
You're gonna
be married.

05:31.594 --> 05:35.197
Jack Brady.
Import-export, real estate. Glad to meet you.

05:35.201 --> 05:38.696
She's been four years
with the guy. What was he thinking?

05:38.701 --> 05:40.433
l proposed
to her mother after a week!

05:40.435 --> 05:42.135
l proposed to her
after half an hour.

05:42.138 --> 05:43.806
Exactly!

05:44.673 --> 05:46.474
Where's the lucky guy?

05:46.541 --> 05:49.844
Packing.
He has a cardiology convention in Dublin.

05:49.848 --> 05:51.944
It's a good thing
that Jeremy finally came around.

05:51.947 --> 05:54.280
You might have
had to follow him to Ireland this weekend.

05:54.283 --> 05:55.347
It is leap year,
you know.

05:55.349 --> 05:57.551
Dad, do not tell
that story again.

05:57.619 --> 05:58.669
Why not?

05:58.687 --> 06:00.021
It's a family myth.

06:00.088 --> 06:02.323
It is the
honest-to-God truth!

06:02.390 --> 06:05.359
That's what Grandma Jane
did to Grandpa Tom.

06:05.426 --> 06:08.729
They'd been dating
for a while and he was dragging his feet,

06:08.796 --> 06:12.633
so she finally suggested
they pay a visit to the old country.

06:12.733 --> 06:15.535
February 29th,
Dublin, Ireland, she hits him with it.

06:15.603 --> 06:16.653
Boom!

06:16.704 --> 06:19.173
Ring on finger,
signed, sealed, delivered.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.809
Well, I'm not going
to have to pull a Grandma Jane.

06:21.876 --> 06:26.146
That's my girl.
I'm finally going to get some grandkids.

06:27.580 --> 06:28.630
Dad, I've got to go.

06:28.648 --> 06:30.416
Mmm-mmm.
No, l just got here!

06:30.617 --> 06:33.353
Yeah, well
you were late. We said 7:

06:33.420 --> 06:34.470
Oh!

06:43.063 --> 06:45.999
I'm just happy
that we want the same things.

06:46.732 --> 06:49.868
You know,
you always have it figured out for us.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.904
l mean, even with
my crazy schedule and...

06:55.274 --> 06:57.609
You know
l appreciate it, right?

07:02.780 --> 07:03.947
So...

07:10.722 --> 07:12.490
So this is for you.

07:14.292 --> 07:15.493
Jeremy.

07:31.241 --> 07:33.109
They're earrings.
Yeah.

07:34.878 --> 07:36.579
For my ears.

07:36.646 --> 07:37.847
Oh! Sorry.

07:38.949 --> 07:42.485
Oh, God.
Dr. Sloane. Hey, Bill.

07:44.121 --> 07:48.225
Oh! Sounds like
you're gonna have to go in from the spine.

07:48.291 --> 07:51.927
Send me a photo.
I'll have a look. Okay? All right. Sorry.

07:54.233 --> 07:56.762
Why don't you
try them on?

07:56.766 --> 07:58.868
Oh! Sorry. Sure.

08:00.802 --> 08:04.972
Yikes. There's an aorta to write home about.
Look at that.

08:05.106 --> 08:06.507
Honey, not here.

08:06.574 --> 08:07.624
Yummy.

08:10.745 --> 08:12.580
So, l...

08:16.217 --> 08:18.018
It's not gonna work.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.690
I'm so sorry, Anna.
Bill says l really "aorta" go in.

08:23.657 --> 08:26.359
Look,
he actually wrote that. He wrote "aorta."

08:26.363 --> 08:29.559
So I'll pick up my bag and just
go straight to the airport when I'm done.

08:29.563 --> 08:30.864
Forgive me?

08:30.931 --> 08:32.599
Of course.
Okay.

08:33.566 --> 08:37.068
l am so sorry.
l love you.

08:38.071 --> 08:39.238
l love you.
Love you.

08:39.306 --> 08:40.356
All right.

08:40.407 --> 08:42.142
You "aorta" run.

09:10.272 --> 09:15.334
It's a good thing
that Jeremy finally came around.

09:15.340 --> 09:17.538
You might have had to
follow him to Ireland this weekend

09:17.541 --> 09:20.644
and pull a Grandma Jane.
It is leap year, you know.

09:22.646 --> 09:25.949
"Leap-year proposals
are an old folklore tradition

09:25.953 --> 09:27.748
"that dates back
to the 5th century."

09:27.751 --> 09:28.801
Sure.

09:28.803 --> 09:30.651
In Ireland,
there's this tradition

09:30.654 --> 09:34.791
that in a leap year,
a woman can propose to a man on February 29th,

09:35.059 --> 09:37.060
one day every four years.

09:37.627 --> 09:39.328
Will you marry me?

09:39.396 --> 09:40.446
Yes.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.700
That's ridiculous.

09:46.260 --> 09:51.502
Are you traveling on business or pleasure?

09:51.508 --> 09:54.677
I'm going to propose
to my boyfriend on leap day.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.646
Are you now?
Congratulations.

09:58.814 --> 10:00.148
Thank you.

10:01.650 --> 10:04.919
Jeremy, my boyfriend,
is already there on business.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.426
We've been together
four years. Four years.

10:11.460 --> 10:13.094
It's a long time.

10:13.195 --> 10:16.898
It's not like
I'm rushing anything by doing this, you know.

10:16.902 --> 10:19.830
He bought me earrings.
Don't get me wrong, they're beautiful,

10:19.834 --> 10:21.200
but earrings
don't exactly say commitment.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.502
Not that commitment
is an issue.

10:22.504 --> 10:24.969
l mean, we're buying
this apartment together and it's perfect.

10:24.972 --> 10:26.704
l know exactly
how I'm going to change it.

10:26.707 --> 10:28.637
We're just gonna
knock down that wall.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.608
You see? If we open up
the kitchen a little,

10:30.610 --> 10:32.840
l think it flows better
into the dining area.

10:32.847 --> 10:35.482
Just creates
a more free overall...

10:36.975 --> 10:42.615
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

10:42.622 --> 10:45.055
It looks like
there's a spot of bad weather up ahead,

10:45.058 --> 10:48.161
so we may experience
just a little bit of turbulence.

10:52.933 --> 10:55.769
I'm getting engaged.
I'm getting engaged.

10:56.769 --> 10:59.638
I'm not gonna die
without getting engaged!

10:59.969 --> 11:05.271
This is your captain
here again, ladies and gentlemen.

11:05.277 --> 11:08.179
l may have underestimated
the storm just a little bit,

11:08.247 --> 11:11.216
but I'm afraid
we are being diverted to Cardiff, Wales,

11:11.220 --> 11:12.748
as Dublin Airport
has been shut down.

11:12.750 --> 11:13.800
What?

11:13.802 --> 11:17.551
Once landed, ground staff
will be happy to book you onto connecting flights

11:17.556 --> 11:20.625
in order to get you
to your final destination.

11:20.892 --> 11:23.928
Wales? No, we can't
land in Wales.

11:24.896 --> 11:26.497
At least
we're landing.

11:26.564 --> 11:28.499
Yes, but I'm on
a schedule.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.838
Excuse me.
Yeah, l need to get through.

11:38.842 --> 11:40.575
Cardiff, Wales Airport regrets to announce

11:40.578 --> 11:42.413
that due to
inclement weather,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.316
all flights today
have been canceled.

11:45.319 --> 11:48.214
I'm sorry, there's
nothing very much l can do about it.

11:48.218 --> 11:49.619
I'm so sorry.

11:49.621 --> 11:50.751
Yeah, could you move?

11:50.753 --> 11:52.952
There are
no more flights until tomorrow.

11:52.956 --> 11:54.357
No flights until tomorrow?

11:54.424 --> 11:55.691
Tomorrow, madam.

11:55.758 --> 11:56.808
Tomorrow.

11:56.810 --> 11:58.292
l think
that's what l said. Didn't l, Beryl?

11:58.295 --> 11:59.496
That is what
you said.

11:59.563 --> 12:02.432
Well, no, that's not
going to work for me.

12:02.698 --> 12:07.903
Look. I'm going to Dublin
to propose to my boyfriend on the 29th, leap day.

12:08.037 --> 12:11.573
It's an old Irish tradition,
and l need to buy a dress

12:11.641 --> 12:15.044
and find a ring
and book a restaurant.

12:15.378 --> 12:16.545
So, between us girls,

12:16.612 --> 12:20.215
l think you can see
why l really need to be there today.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.282
Oh! Right.
Right!

12:23.284 --> 12:26.754
Beryl, will you ring
Dublin International Airport

12:26.821 --> 12:29.411
and get them
to open a runway especially for madam?

12:29.457 --> 12:30.825
Right away.

12:41.533 --> 12:49.801
We regret to announce that
all commercial passenger ferries to Ireland

12:49.809 --> 12:51.410
have been canceled.

12:51.478 --> 12:54.581
Will all passengers
booked for the crossing to Ringaskiddy

12:54.881 --> 12:57.550
please report to
the information desk?

12:57.554 --> 12:59.050
Hi. I'd like a ticket
to Cork, please.

12:59.052 --> 13:01.087
Ferry's canceled.

13:01.187 --> 13:03.522
What is wrong
with this country?

13:04.991 --> 13:06.826
l usually blame
the government,

13:06.893 --> 13:09.328
but this one's
the weather. Storm, see?

13:10.129 --> 13:14.166
Well, we'll just
see about that. I'll find my own boat.

13:24.643 --> 13:27.345
We're going
to have to go in to Dingle.

13:27.946 --> 13:29.714
But l paid for Cork!

13:32.684 --> 13:34.786
Okay. Dingle will do.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.408
You can take the man
out of the fish,

14:33.475 --> 14:36.411
but you can't take
the fish out of the water!

14:38.880 --> 14:40.314
That a good one,
Dekko?

14:41.482 --> 14:42.683
Hello.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.522
Are you open?

14:48.855 --> 14:50.056
Australian.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.257
South African.

14:51.325 --> 14:54.261
Actually, she's American.
Anna, from Boston.

14:55.195 --> 14:58.145
l just need someone
to tell me how to get to Dublin from here.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.966
Is there a bus, maybe?

15:00.033 --> 15:01.768
1987.

15:02.836 --> 15:03.886
I'm sorry?

15:03.904 --> 15:06.473
The year
the last Dublin bus left Dingle.

15:07.107 --> 15:10.743
No, no, no. The train
stopped running in '87.

15:10.811 --> 15:13.113
The bus stopped
running in 1989.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.347
It was 1987.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.581
Okay.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.753
Is there a taxi service
or something?

15:28.527 --> 15:30.262
Perfect. Thank you.

15:39.704 --> 15:41.639
My battery's going
to die any second.

15:41.706 --> 15:42.756
Ma'am.

15:46.877 --> 15:48.778
Oh, thank you.

15:54.786 --> 15:56.187
Hello there.

15:56.286 --> 15:57.453
Hello.

16:11.568 --> 16:12.618
Hello?

16:12.636 --> 16:14.871
Hello. Yes, l need
a taxi to Dublin.

16:14.937 --> 16:17.105
Yeah, where you
calling from?

16:17.306 --> 16:20.942
I'm in a funny little pub
called the Carack or, l don't know, Caragh?

16:21.010 --> 16:22.511
Carahg?

16:22.578 --> 16:23.628
Whatever.

16:23.646 --> 16:25.447
We don't drive
American redheads.

16:25.514 --> 16:28.164
What do you mean
you don't drive American redheads?

16:28.216 --> 16:30.284
How do you know
the color of my hair?

16:37.993 --> 16:42.464
Of course.
You're the taxi driver. Well, l need you...

16:45.333 --> 16:46.967
l need you
to drive me to Dublin.

16:47.034 --> 16:48.084
Dublin, is it?

16:48.135 --> 16:49.185
Mmm.

16:50.906 --> 16:54.376
Well, I'll tell you
something about Dublin, Anna from Boston.

16:54.575 --> 17:00.213
Dublin is a city
of chancers and cheats and backstabbing snakes.

17:00.481 --> 17:06.252
It's where the worst
of humanity collects to poison this fair country.

17:07.454 --> 17:12.959
l wouldn't drive you
to Dublin if you were to offer me 500.

17:13.694 --> 17:16.762
Jesus! I'd sell
me wife for 500!

17:16.829 --> 17:18.998
Trust me,
you'd have few takers.

17:20.266 --> 17:23.868
All right.
Anyone else want to go to Dublin for 500?

17:23.936 --> 17:25.738
I'm your man, missus!

17:28.407 --> 17:30.743
It's bad luck
to start a journey on a Friday.

17:30.810 --> 17:34.413
Saturday. It's bad luck
to start a journey on a Saturday.

17:34.479 --> 17:35.529
Tuesday!

17:35.547 --> 17:37.515
No, it's Sunday,
to be sure.

17:37.917 --> 17:39.685
Fine. It's late.

17:39.687 --> 17:42.750
I'll just find
somebody to drive me in the morning.

17:42.754 --> 17:47.191
So, if one of you
can direct me to the nearest hotel?

17:47.926 --> 17:49.927
Or bed and breakfast?

17:55.633 --> 17:58.936
Of course. Of course.
This is also the hotel.

18:01.037 --> 18:05.408
Bathroom's down the hall.
You have to flush it twice. Seriously, twice.

18:06.109 --> 18:07.910
Just like
the Four Seasons.

18:12.248 --> 18:13.382
Okay.

18:15.085 --> 18:17.253
l noticed a menu
on the bar?

18:17.854 --> 18:19.689
It's closed.
Closed.

18:19.923 --> 18:22.525
But given the famous
Irish tradition

18:22.592 --> 18:25.261
of hospitality
and generosity...

18:27.664 --> 18:29.932
I'll do you
a hang sandwich.

18:30.265 --> 18:31.599
What's a hang?

18:35.471 --> 18:40.242
Hang is a verb.
It's not a sandwich.

18:45.146 --> 18:47.047
It did die. Of course.

18:59.427 --> 19:00.528
Huh!

19:53.079 --> 19:54.480
There we go.

19:56.985 --> 19:59.947
Hey,
the lights are gone!

19:59.951 --> 20:02.353
Oh, Jesus,
the lights failed again.

20:04.622 --> 20:05.789
Women!

20:06.958 --> 20:08.092
It's over now.

20:08.158 --> 20:09.993
For the love of God.

20:24.741 --> 20:26.843
What the hell you doing?

20:26.910 --> 20:28.411
Plugging something in.

20:29.345 --> 20:31.480
Give me that.
It's personal.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.550
You fried my BlackBerry.

20:34.617 --> 20:36.919
You fried the whole
village! Idiot!

20:38.421 --> 20:39.655
Jackass.

20:53.626 --> 20:56.834
You're here in Ireland?

20:56.838 --> 20:57.888
Yeah.

20:57.906 --> 21:01.276
l wanted to surprise you,
but it's turned into a complete disaster.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.407
At this point I'm just glad
somebody knows where l am.

21:03.410 --> 21:07.380
l mean, seriously, you have no
idea what passes for a hotel out here,

21:07.448 --> 21:08.715
or common courtesy.

21:08.782 --> 21:09.983
l can't wait
to see you.

21:09.986 --> 21:11.416
Well, l can't wait
to see you, either.

21:11.418 --> 21:12.751
Well, when will
you get here?

21:12.753 --> 21:15.218
l should be there
this afternoon. l just need to get a cab.

21:15.222 --> 21:16.923
Great surprise, honey.
I love you.

21:16.991 --> 21:18.859
l love you, too. Bye.

21:18.862 --> 21:22.424
Sorry, Declan,
you've had plenty of time to pay your debt.

21:22.428 --> 21:25.361
But I'm almost there.
I'm down to the last of the bloody interest.

21:25.365 --> 21:26.898
Come on, Tommo,
be reasonable, would you?

21:26.901 --> 21:28.466
You can't take
the blessed kitchen!

21:28.468 --> 21:29.567
You'll put me
out of business!

21:29.569 --> 21:32.905
The whole lot,
or the kitchen goes in the back of the van.

21:32.972 --> 21:34.540
Give me a month.

21:34.607 --> 21:35.908
A month? A week.

21:35.975 --> 21:37.876
A week? God!

21:37.944 --> 21:40.780
Ten days, 900,
guaranteed.

21:40.847 --> 21:42.348
A thousand, Dekko.

21:42.350 --> 21:43.914
That's the
old interest right there.

21:43.917 --> 21:46.519
The interest on
the interest on the... Oh, man.

21:47.486 --> 21:49.688
Ten days, 1,.
Okay. Okay.

21:49.952 --> 21:53.054
You'll have it.
You have my word.

21:53.058 --> 21:54.259
Done.

21:54.893 --> 21:56.461
Later.
All right, lads.

22:00.866 --> 22:04.703
Come on, then, let's do it.
But only 'cause you're desperate.

22:06.337 --> 22:07.705
I'll drive you
to Dublin.

22:07.772 --> 22:09.540
Will you get out?

22:10.942 --> 22:13.678
500, like you said.
Yes or no?

22:13.744 --> 22:15.145
You're not a fan
of Dublin.

22:15.147 --> 22:18.111
You've made that very clear,
so l won't inconvenience you.

22:18.115 --> 22:19.625
It's not
inconvenient at all.

22:19.650 --> 22:22.060
What part of "get out"
do you not understand?

22:22.086 --> 22:23.420
A simple yes
or no will do.

22:23.486 --> 22:25.120
Yes, you can
drive me, now...

22:25.189 --> 22:27.658
Good. Be outside
in 10 minutes.

22:27.724 --> 22:28.774
God!

22:29.227 --> 22:30.928
Naked here!

22:30.930 --> 22:32.392
By the way,
it's 100 for the room,

22:32.395 --> 22:34.263
and that includes
the vandalism.

22:34.331 --> 22:35.899
I'll leave you to it.

22:37.200 --> 22:38.250
Naked here.

22:58.254 --> 23:00.356
There you are, Bob.
Hop in.

23:00.359 --> 23:02.354
Please tell me that
that is the car

23:02.357 --> 23:05.860
that is taking us
around the corner to the actual taxi.

23:05.995 --> 23:09.865
I'll have you know
that is a Renault 4. She's classic!

23:11.733 --> 23:13.634
Worst fears confirmed.

23:13.701 --> 23:16.570
She's rock solid right there!
Beautiful. Come on.

23:17.304 --> 23:20.306
None of those
fancy airbags to get in the way.

23:21.541 --> 23:24.710
Don't listen to her.
She knows not what she says.

23:29.983 --> 23:31.384
Do you mind?

23:32.452 --> 23:33.553
Ah! Sure.

23:39.860 --> 23:41.194
Thank you.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.765
How does that work?

23:45.731 --> 23:49.101
Can you be careful with that?
That was a gift from my boyfriend.

23:49.169 --> 23:50.499
He bought you
a suitcase?

23:52.538 --> 23:54.006
It's a Vuitton.

23:54.740 --> 23:55.790
What?

23:56.042 --> 23:57.510
A Louis Vuitton?

23:57.575 --> 23:58.625
Come on.

24:02.347 --> 24:06.651
Is it yourself, Louis? Can l give
you a hand getting into the car, Louis?

24:06.718 --> 24:09.220
She named her suitcase.
She's a crackpot.

24:09.454 --> 24:10.955
You can't
go now, missus.

24:11.022 --> 24:12.072
Why not?

24:12.123 --> 24:14.625
A black cat just
crossed your path.

24:15.193 --> 24:18.496
You can't start a journey
when you see a black cat.

24:19.230 --> 24:20.965
Ten years bad luck.

24:21.665 --> 24:24.434
No, it's not a cat,
it's a magpie.

24:24.501 --> 24:27.237
Anyway,
it's 15 years bad luck.

24:27.305 --> 24:28.355
Thirteen!

24:28.372 --> 24:30.207
It's 12,
definitely 12.

24:30.209 --> 24:33.173
Then l guess
it's a good thing l don't believe in luck, so...

24:33.177 --> 24:36.046
Well, you ought to,
if you're getting into that, you.

24:38.048 --> 24:39.098
Safe journey.

24:42.252 --> 24:44.921
May the road
rise up to meet you.

24:45.189 --> 24:46.290
See you, lads!

24:46.292 --> 24:47.488
Good luck, Declan!

24:47.490 --> 24:48.791
Bye, now.

24:53.395 --> 24:55.230
l tell you
something,

24:56.065 --> 24:58.033
they'll kill
each other!

25:02.804 --> 25:05.239
Okay,
we're here, on the road.

25:05.308 --> 25:06.742
Uh-huh!

25:06.744 --> 25:09.640
It's only February 27th.
l still have two days to get there, so...

25:09.644 --> 25:10.878
Mmm-hmm.

25:11.213 --> 25:12.714
Where are we?

25:23.758 --> 25:27.495
l may even get there before the stores close.
l could get some shopping in.

25:27.561 --> 25:30.664
That's the reason
you're going to Dublin, is to shop?

25:30.731 --> 25:32.065
No, I'm...

25:35.136 --> 25:38.806
lf you must know,
I'm going there to propose to my boyfriend.

25:38.873 --> 25:42.676
He's at a medical
conference there. He's a cardiologist.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.541
We are applying
to move into the most amazing apartment,

25:46.546 --> 25:48.979
and l actually thought
he was going to propose to me the other night,

25:48.982 --> 25:50.032
but he didn't.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.099
Yeah?

25:51.418 --> 25:54.354
Yeah, and you guys have
this great tradition

25:54.421 --> 25:56.156
that a woman can
propose to a man

25:56.522 --> 25:59.691
on the 29th of February
in a leap year.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.259
Yeah?
Yeah.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.510
Mmm-hmm.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.095
So l thought,
"Why not?"

26:04.164 --> 26:05.298
Yeah!

26:05.365 --> 26:06.466
Yeah.

26:07.132 --> 26:08.182
l mean...

26:16.442 --> 26:18.732
That's the
stupidest thing I've ever heard!

26:22.613 --> 26:23.663
No, it isn't.

26:23.714 --> 26:25.115
Yeah, it is.

26:26.751 --> 26:30.521
No, it's a tradition.
It's a romantic tradition.

26:30.525 --> 26:33.454
It's a day for
desperate women trying to trap themselves a man

26:33.458 --> 26:35.793
who clearly doesn't
want to get married.

26:35.796 --> 26:38.292
You've got to know
that if your man wanted to propose,

26:38.296 --> 26:41.065
he'd have done it
already. Fact!

27:07.923 --> 27:09.424
No one touches the music!

27:12.161 --> 27:17.699
Are you crazy?
You know nothing about me or Jeremy!

27:17.765 --> 27:19.766
You know what you are?
You're a cynic.

27:19.834 --> 27:22.002
You're a lonely,
bitter cynic.

27:22.005 --> 27:24.602
Better that than an idiot.
"Leap year, diddly-eye!

27:24.606 --> 27:25.738
"Will you marry me,
diddly-eye?

27:25.740 --> 27:29.477
"I've got a suitcase
called Louis, diddly-eye!"

27:30.611 --> 27:32.841
What are you,
the Lucky Charms Leprechaun?

27:32.845 --> 27:34.779
You know what? We are done.
We're not talking anymore.

27:34.781 --> 27:36.614
I'm not paying you to talk,
I'm not paying for your opinion.

27:36.617 --> 27:39.383
I'm paying
you to drive, so just get in the car and drive.

27:39.387 --> 27:40.888
Suits me, Bob.

27:41.222 --> 27:42.852
And what is with
this Bob thing?

27:53.351 --> 27:56.632
Aren't you going
to do something?

27:56.636 --> 27:59.472
l am doing something.
I'm waiting for them to move.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.708
For God's sake.

28:03.676 --> 28:04.943
Hi, cows.

28:05.444 --> 28:09.314
Look, l have spent
the past 24 hours in every level of hell,

28:09.319 --> 28:12.247
and l am not going to let
your black and white asses

28:12.251 --> 28:16.521
drag me any further,
so if you know what's good for you, you'll move.

28:17.456 --> 28:20.959
It comes as a real shock
to find out that you speak fluent cow.

28:21.026 --> 28:22.093
Now!

28:23.929 --> 28:26.231
That's right.
Nice cows.

28:27.165 --> 28:30.134
Let's move.
Let's move along. Come on, cows.

28:30.302 --> 28:32.837
Why don't you
propose something to them?

28:32.904 --> 28:35.172
Yeah, you guys are...
Wow, you're big.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.275
We're gonna just...

28:38.276 --> 28:39.810
Oh, yeah,
they're moving now.

28:41.211 --> 28:42.612
Must be your personality.

28:42.615 --> 28:44.112
Yours is a bit
more repellent,

28:44.114 --> 28:46.149
so if you want to try...

28:49.719 --> 28:52.688
That's right.
That's how you get things done.

28:53.090 --> 28:54.458
That's it, girl!

28:54.460 --> 28:58.524
That's right!
That is how you get things done.

28:58.529 --> 29:02.299
You don't just
sit around like some backwoods Irish bumpkin.

29:05.201 --> 29:06.735
You're welcome.

29:07.303 --> 29:09.605
You might want to
just watch your

29:11.140 --> 29:12.241
step.

29:16.878 --> 29:18.279
$600 shoes.

29:18.282 --> 29:20.614
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

29:20.617 --> 29:22.952
Put them in the wash?
The wash?

29:24.119 --> 29:26.821
You do not put
these shoes in the wash.

29:28.991 --> 29:30.258
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

29:30.325 --> 29:32.160
Stop!
Whoa! Wait!

29:32.327 --> 29:33.417
Stop it!
What do l do?

29:33.462 --> 29:35.897
Get in the car
and use the brake!

29:38.065 --> 29:41.401
Baby!
l got you, baby! l got you!

29:46.807 --> 29:47.941
Baby!

29:49.243 --> 29:50.611
Don't hurt yourself!

29:50.677 --> 29:52.427
Make it stop!
My purse is in there!

30:09.529 --> 30:14.033
Oh, darling.
Oh, Jesus.

30:15.167 --> 30:17.168
My Renault 4!
Look what you done!

30:17.236 --> 30:18.337
What I've done?

30:18.405 --> 30:21.040
You couldn't just
wait for the cows!

30:21.106 --> 30:23.141
You couldn't
just help me?

30:23.144 --> 30:25.307
It's gonna cost at least
200 to tow her out.

30:25.310 --> 30:27.709
That's not gonna
come out of my pocket. It's coming out of yours!

30:27.712 --> 30:32.049
Oh, like hell.
You will have to kill me before l pay you a dime!

30:33.652 --> 30:34.953
There's an idea.

30:48.299 --> 30:49.933
Where you going?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.050
Dublin.

30:51.052 --> 30:55.500
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Look, this is an easy fix.

30:55.506 --> 30:56.605
All we need to do
is find a phone,

30:56.607 --> 30:58.339
call the garage,
get a tow, hop in the car,

30:58.341 --> 31:00.407
back on the road
and we'll be in Dublin in no time.

31:00.410 --> 31:03.079
Just cool the jets,
would you?

31:35.210 --> 31:36.978
Wait! Hey!

31:37.979 --> 31:40.581
l wouldn't
get in there if l was you!

31:40.815 --> 31:43.551
And l care about
your opinion because...

31:44.552 --> 31:46.086
Fine, go ahead.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.992
All right there, sweetheart?
Hi.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.157
You looking
for a ride?

31:52.159 --> 31:53.894
Yes, I'm going
to Dublin.

31:53.961 --> 31:55.011
Oh!

31:55.062 --> 31:58.331
In Dublin's fair city
where the girls are so pretty

31:58.335 --> 31:59.731
Yes.
Now there's a coincidence,

31:59.734 --> 32:01.199
'cause I'm going
there myself.

32:01.201 --> 32:03.267
Let me help you with
the old suitcase there.

32:03.270 --> 32:04.436
That's very sweet of you.

32:04.438 --> 32:05.505
Not at all.

32:05.572 --> 32:07.022
And l didn't
even have to ask.

32:09.610 --> 32:10.877
Top of the morning to you!

32:10.943 --> 32:12.177
Oh! Morning.

32:13.747 --> 32:16.416
That's a fancy
bit of suitcase, no mistake.

32:16.419 --> 32:19.114
It's quality.
You can see that just by Looking at it, you know?

32:19.118 --> 32:20.352
Mmm-hmm.

32:22.889 --> 32:25.291
Well, I'd say
it's been a pleasure,

32:25.358 --> 32:27.193
but l think
we both know that...

32:28.761 --> 32:33.198
Wait. No! Wait!
Wait! Come back here! You can't just...

32:42.207 --> 32:43.408
They...

33:14.070 --> 33:15.571
There you are.

33:15.574 --> 33:19.805
Soon as l finish this,
I'll call us a tow truck.

33:19.810 --> 33:22.012
Us? There is no us.

33:22.911 --> 33:27.248
l am calling a real taxi.
You leave me alone.

33:29.586 --> 33:30.920
Okay, Bob.

33:33.255 --> 33:34.589
Excuse me.

33:36.525 --> 33:37.726
Eoghan?

33:42.865 --> 33:44.066
Eoghan.

33:44.132 --> 33:45.182
Oh!

33:46.735 --> 33:49.137
Do you have
a phone, please? Please?

33:52.440 --> 33:53.774
Thank you.

33:56.911 --> 33:58.245
Safe home.

34:03.784 --> 34:04.834
Yeah, yeah.

34:17.163 --> 34:19.213
So nice of you
to look after my suitcase,

34:19.232 --> 34:20.802
but I'll take it back.
Thank you.

34:20.833 --> 34:22.702
Is that right, missus?

34:23.235 --> 34:26.371
I'll call the
American ambassador.

34:26.505 --> 34:27.739
Oh, is this his?

34:31.143 --> 34:32.744
Well, l just...

34:34.179 --> 34:35.280
l...

34:40.185 --> 34:41.819
Fun's over, lads.

34:45.357 --> 34:47.559
Give the girl
her stuff back.

34:48.726 --> 34:50.161
And who the hell are you?

34:50.228 --> 34:52.597
Nobody.
Just keeping the peace.

34:52.665 --> 34:54.895
Yeah?
Well, you can keep your peace out of it.

35:26.262 --> 35:27.496
That was

35:30.366 --> 35:31.734
impressive.

35:32.535 --> 35:33.602
Ow!

35:35.304 --> 35:36.371
Out.

35:37.540 --> 35:38.941
Fair enough.

35:41.076 --> 35:42.544
Hi. l just...

35:42.878 --> 35:45.046
Should just get
my things and go.

35:53.154 --> 35:55.189
Must be something special.

35:55.557 --> 35:56.624
Who?

35:58.326 --> 35:59.694
Your fella.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.529
Oh!

36:02.129 --> 36:03.630
Jeremy. He is.

36:04.532 --> 36:05.900
He's...

36:07.301 --> 36:09.069
He's a cardiologist.

36:24.083 --> 36:26.618
Hi. When is the next train
to Dublin?

36:27.053 --> 36:28.821
You're just in time.

36:29.255 --> 36:33.292
The next train leaves
in two hours and 43 minutes.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.727
Great.

36:36.829 --> 36:39.131
It's a few bob
to Dublin, mind.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.732
"Bob"?

36:40.933 --> 36:42.034
Cash.

36:42.702 --> 36:44.670
Money. You know?

36:46.338 --> 36:47.439
Mmm.

37:01.185 --> 37:02.553
Hey, fella.

37:08.060 --> 37:09.110
Ballycarbery.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.193
Mmm. Same to you.

37:11.228 --> 37:13.330
There.
Ballycarbery Castle.

37:13.631 --> 37:16.800
It's one of
the 10 wonders of Ireland, so I'm told.

37:18.269 --> 37:20.704
Can only be
15 minutes to the top.

37:21.029 --> 37:24.004
l don't want to
miss the train.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.840
Yeah, well
that's a good point. Don't miss the train.

37:25.843 --> 37:26.893
No.

37:27.577 --> 37:29.612
Only two
and a half hours.

37:31.247 --> 37:33.282
Time is going to fly.

37:38.421 --> 37:39.955
I'll stay here.

37:41.391 --> 37:42.825
Suit yourself.

37:42.892 --> 37:44.093
l will.

37:51.034 --> 37:52.084
Hi.

37:54.037 --> 37:55.087
Hi.

37:56.839 --> 37:58.040
Declan?

37:58.574 --> 38:01.376
Wait! l love castles.

38:04.012 --> 38:05.546
It's beautiful.

38:06.647 --> 38:10.197
I'm sorry you're
not gonna get to Dublin before the shops shut.

38:10.251 --> 38:12.987
l have
other interests besides shopping.

38:13.387 --> 38:15.188
l have a life.
A job.

38:16.357 --> 38:18.158
What do you do, then?

38:18.225 --> 38:19.960
l stage apartments.

38:20.595 --> 38:22.897
Stage apartments,
now that's...

38:23.898 --> 38:25.232
That's...

38:26.366 --> 38:27.767
What's that?

38:28.535 --> 38:32.739
Well, when somebody
is selling an apartment or a home,

38:33.640 --> 38:38.411
l bring stuff in
and make it look as beautiful as it can look.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.111
And they get
to keep all the stuff when they buy it?

38:41.114 --> 38:43.846
No, l take it away.
I'm just presenting them with the possibilities.

38:43.850 --> 38:45.017
l put a sheen on it.

38:45.085 --> 38:47.787
Hang on. So you do
your job, yeah?

38:47.854 --> 38:48.921
Yeah.

38:49.221 --> 38:50.689
They buy the house,
yeah?

38:50.756 --> 38:51.823
Yeah.

38:51.825 --> 38:54.856
And then you come along
and you take all the stuff away again, yeah?

38:54.860 --> 38:55.961
Yeah.

38:57.062 --> 38:58.830
You're a con artist.

39:00.465 --> 39:02.700
No, I'm not a con...

39:03.268 --> 39:05.570
That's just
so typical of you.

39:05.637 --> 39:07.327
You think the worst
of everybody.

39:07.372 --> 39:08.422
No.

39:08.974 --> 39:12.210
Oh, no? I'd love
to know who you have a good word for.

39:12.544 --> 39:15.546
l can think of a couple
of good words for you.

39:17.615 --> 39:19.149
Riddle me this.

39:19.151 --> 39:21.782
lf your apartment's on fire,
your beautiful apartment,

39:21.786 --> 39:23.420
what would you take?

39:23.487 --> 39:24.588
What?

39:25.123 --> 39:28.593
lf your house was on fire
and you had 60 seconds,

39:28.659 --> 39:30.894
what would you take?
Come on.

39:32.462 --> 39:33.512
l...

39:33.530 --> 39:36.666
Come on. Would it be
the Chihuahua on the duvet?

39:36.670 --> 39:39.166
I'm not playing
this game with you.

39:39.169 --> 39:40.670
There you are.

39:41.370 --> 39:43.138
What would you take?

39:44.540 --> 39:47.709
What would you take?
Your lovely inn is on fire.

39:47.810 --> 39:48.911
Hmm.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.613
What are you
going to take? You know, your...

39:51.681 --> 39:54.884
Flames coming up
the stairs. You've got 60 seconds.

39:54.951 --> 39:56.001
Oh!

39:56.052 --> 39:58.854
The bottles of alcohol
in your pub are exploding.

39:58.921 --> 40:00.522
What are you
going to grab?

40:00.589 --> 40:02.691
l know exactly
what I'd "grab."

40:02.758 --> 40:04.292
Oh, yeah? What?

40:06.996 --> 40:08.630
Not telling you.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.503
You can dish it,
but you can't take it, can you?

40:19.241 --> 40:20.775
It's really...

40:22.376 --> 40:23.877
It's a castle!

40:24.278 --> 40:25.545
Told you.

40:27.448 --> 40:29.850
So what's the story
with this place?

40:29.917 --> 40:32.019
Well, hundreds
of years ago,

40:32.419 --> 40:36.756
there was this
beautiful girl called Grainne.

40:38.025 --> 40:41.294
Now, she was promised
in marriage to this fella called Fionn,

40:41.361 --> 40:45.231
who was kind of
a cranky old warlord,

40:45.236 --> 40:48.797
old enough to be her father,
old enough to be her grandfather,

40:48.801 --> 40:49.851
and therefore

40:50.970 --> 40:52.838
she wasn't
in love with him.

40:52.841 --> 40:55.005
Anyway, on the night
of their betrothal,

40:55.008 --> 40:59.445
whom did she meet
but a handsome young warrior, Diarmuid.

41:00.013 --> 41:03.850
They fell madly in love
at first sight, but what could she do?

41:03.983 --> 41:07.686
Well, she slips
a sleeping potion in everyone's drinks,

41:07.753 --> 41:11.323
and the pair of them
run off together across the Shannon.

41:12.323 --> 41:16.827
Fionn wakes
and there's Grainne gone. Well, he goes mental.

41:17.195 --> 41:20.298
Takes his army
and heads off in hot pursuit.

41:20.731 --> 41:25.102
But it was the people,
you know, the people in the villages of Ireland,

41:25.304 --> 41:27.939
they took pity on
Diarmuid and Grainne.

41:28.039 --> 41:31.876
They hid them in forests
and in their barns and castles,

41:32.109 --> 41:35.479
where they'd sleep one night
and then they'd move on.

41:38.149 --> 41:39.199
Come on.

41:39.250 --> 41:40.300
Is it safe?

41:40.318 --> 41:41.368
Of course.

41:42.719 --> 41:46.989
Sleep was all they did,
'cause Diarmuid, good man that he was,

41:47.524 --> 41:50.326
was suffering the old guilt
about two-timing Fionn

41:50.393 --> 41:54.697
and out of respect for him,
didn't, you know, take it any further.

41:55.098 --> 41:57.066
l get it.
Oh, yeah.

42:05.974 --> 42:08.409
And then they came
to this castle

42:08.544 --> 42:10.078
and this view.

42:10.379 --> 42:11.446
Wow.

42:13.414 --> 42:17.151
And 'tis said, you know,
that, unable to resist such beauty,

42:17.853 --> 42:19.221
that here,

42:19.754 --> 42:21.622
in this place, they...

42:24.692 --> 42:26.827
They consummated
their love.

42:36.003 --> 42:38.405
Oh, my God.
You're hitting on me.

42:38.739 --> 42:40.006
I'm what?

42:42.043 --> 42:44.578
I'm the young woman
on the eve of her engagement

42:44.644 --> 42:47.747
that can't resist
a handsome stranger? Oh, come on.

42:48.014 --> 42:49.181
I'm what?

42:49.249 --> 42:52.719
You didn't honestly think
that was gonna work, did you?

42:52.886 --> 42:55.588
Don't flatter
yourself, darling. The story's true,

42:55.654 --> 42:58.123
but it sure as shite
ain't about you.

42:58.191 --> 43:00.159
No?
No, you arrogant...

43:01.361 --> 43:02.962
Arrogant what exactly?

43:03.028 --> 43:06.698
Well, that's a tough one.
Is it American?

43:10.202 --> 43:11.870
Oh, no. The train.

43:12.570 --> 43:14.705
Wait! Wait,
l have a ticket!

43:15.374 --> 43:16.541
I'm very...

43:23.052 --> 43:27.414
You just had to take me
up there, didn't you?

43:27.420 --> 43:29.955
One of the seven
wonders of Ireland!

43:36.027 --> 43:37.228
Okay.

43:39.797 --> 43:40.998
Oh, no.

43:56.712 --> 43:59.214
Well, that speeded
things up a bit.

44:00.016 --> 44:01.183
l hate you.

44:17.499 --> 44:19.901
In the old days,
l could have held it for you,

44:19.968 --> 44:22.603
but it's all
"time is money" nowadays.

44:26.641 --> 44:30.077
Come on, now.
Come on, and don't be worrying yourself.

44:33.714 --> 44:36.349
We'll get you to
where you want to go.

44:42.590 --> 44:44.358
Forecast said sunny.

44:54.667 --> 44:58.871
Here we are.
The best little B8B in Tipperary.

45:00.807 --> 45:02.441
Come in. Come in.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.682
Look what
the cat dragged in.

45:10.549 --> 45:13.218
Oh! My poor dears.

45:13.222 --> 45:15.352
You're lucky,
so you are.

45:15.355 --> 45:17.887
Just half an hour ago,
l had two backpackers at the door

45:17.890 --> 45:19.524
wanting the room.

45:19.658 --> 45:21.693
But they weren't married.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.395
Admitted it right out.
No shame.

45:25.030 --> 45:26.965
So l sent them packing.

45:27.132 --> 45:29.901
Right is right,
rain or no rain.

45:29.968 --> 45:31.069
Hmm.

45:31.904 --> 45:33.805
So, it's Mr. and Mrs...

45:34.239 --> 45:35.807
Brady.
O'Callaghan.

45:35.873 --> 45:37.407
Bradycallaghan.

45:38.843 --> 45:40.444
O'Bradycallaghan.

45:40.447 --> 45:43.577
We're not long married,
and it's still quite a mouthful for an American.

45:43.581 --> 45:46.417
l come from a long,
long line of Dingle

45:47.518 --> 45:49.186
O'Bradycallaghans.

45:49.353 --> 45:51.154
We're praying
that one day

45:51.489 --> 45:54.559
we'll be able to have
a son and heir to help keep the name going.

45:56.093 --> 45:58.829
Anna, Declan to you.

45:59.564 --> 46:02.300
Lovely.
Now, let's get you to your room.

46:02.766 --> 46:03.816
Thank you.

46:03.833 --> 46:04.967
After you, petal.

46:05.302 --> 46:07.037
Thank you, sunshine.

46:07.103 --> 46:10.039
Would you like a hand
with the bag, pumpkin?

46:16.779 --> 46:20.949
Well, you're not sleeping
in that bed with me, Mr. O'Bradycallaghan.

46:21.850 --> 46:24.419
Maybe you're not sleeping
in the bed with me.

46:24.486 --> 46:26.387
Very gallant.
Gallant?

46:27.590 --> 46:29.892
Welcome to the age
of equality.

46:30.625 --> 46:34.028
You lot wanted the vote.
Live with it, darling.

46:35.697 --> 46:36.864
Comfy.

46:37.699 --> 46:40.101
We'll flip for it, darling.

46:41.402 --> 46:43.036
Okay, fair's fair.

46:44.973 --> 46:47.108
Heads l win,
tails you lose.

46:50.311 --> 46:51.478
Heads.

46:51.912 --> 46:53.246
Heads it is.

46:53.314 --> 46:55.082
Shame. You can sleep

46:56.883 --> 46:58.284
in the bath.

47:06.059 --> 47:07.560
It's a shower.

47:09.463 --> 47:11.598
You can sleep
in the shower.

47:13.933 --> 47:15.034
Fine.

47:15.202 --> 47:18.738
Just so long as
l don't have to sleep anywhere near you.

47:27.712 --> 47:29.680
I'm washing in the shower

47:30.182 --> 47:32.384
Getting mud off
Love hot water

47:33.419 --> 47:35.821
Got a bruise there
Got a bruise there

47:35.887 --> 47:39.557
Wait a minute. You lying,
deceiving son of a...

47:40.425 --> 47:42.593
Get up! Get up.
Get up.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.362
Whoa! What?

47:44.429 --> 47:47.331
Oh! "Heads you win,
tails l lose."

47:47.831 --> 47:50.066
You finally
got that, did you?

47:50.535 --> 47:51.669
Good for you.

47:51.735 --> 47:55.405
Up! Get up!
This is my bed. Liars forfeit.

47:57.307 --> 47:58.975
And take a shower.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.093
You smell.

48:00.110 --> 48:01.344
Mmm-mmm.

48:01.346 --> 48:03.444
You can see right
through the curtain.

48:03.447 --> 48:04.681
Can you?

48:06.650 --> 48:07.784
Can you?

48:07.850 --> 48:10.385
Okay,
liars forfeit, liars forfeit!

48:11.588 --> 48:12.956
No peeking.

48:14.891 --> 48:15.941
Come in.

48:15.958 --> 48:17.826
Hello, dear.
Everything all right?

48:17.994 --> 48:22.164
Now, for dinner
we've got tripe. Homemade. Family recipe.

48:22.365 --> 48:23.532
Tripe.

48:24.033 --> 48:27.069
Nothing like a bit
of cow's stomach on a rainy day.

48:27.136 --> 48:29.838
Yum. Did you hear that,
darling? Tripe!

48:30.772 --> 48:32.240
Right, tripe.

48:32.243 --> 48:33.873
l was thinking,
Mrs. O'Docherty,

48:33.875 --> 48:36.308
to thank you
for taking us in on such short notice,

48:36.311 --> 48:38.179
why don't you
let me cook?

48:38.246 --> 48:39.714
No, darling,
l couldn't.

48:39.781 --> 48:42.950
Oh, you could.
He's a chef. He's very good.

48:43.018 --> 48:44.285
It's true!

48:44.352 --> 48:47.021
Really?
Well, that's gas.

48:47.689 --> 48:50.825
We've got two Italians
staying, as well. Would that be okay?

48:50.891 --> 48:52.559
No problem at all!

48:52.728 --> 48:54.362
Thanks a million.

48:58.766 --> 49:00.100
Good call.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.550
What the hell
are you doing now?

49:21.554 --> 49:23.822
This recipe says
three medium carrots,

49:23.890 --> 49:27.393
and l just think this one is a little
large to be classified as medium.

49:27.460 --> 49:29.662
And if you look
at these two,

49:30.062 --> 49:33.465
they're clearly medium,
while this one is slightly...

49:35.868 --> 49:37.035
Watch.

49:37.670 --> 49:40.472
Three medium-sized carrots.

49:42.775 --> 49:47.279
You know, l don't think there's anything
wrong with wanting to be precise.

49:47.613 --> 49:48.714
Okay.

49:49.448 --> 49:51.583
Well, then
you must be very,

49:52.351 --> 49:53.852
very precise.

49:55.554 --> 49:56.604
Here's an idea.

49:56.606 --> 50:00.020
Why don't you stop trying
to control everything in the known universe?

50:00.024 --> 50:02.426
It's dinner.
Have a little faith.

50:03.261 --> 50:04.996
It'll all work out.

50:05.862 --> 50:07.363
Heard that one before.

50:07.431 --> 50:10.000
Well, maybe you
should have listened.

50:10.066 --> 50:11.567
Really? You think?

50:11.636 --> 50:16.107
It'll all work out.
My dad was the king of "it'll all work out."

50:16.173 --> 50:18.909
Time shares in the Bahamas,
mobile video stores,

50:18.913 --> 50:20.241
whatever the next
big nothing was,

50:20.243 --> 50:22.244
all our money
went right after it.

50:22.312 --> 50:25.381
But don't worry.
It'll all work out.

50:25.385 --> 50:30.047
Cut to me working
two part-time jobs after school

50:30.052 --> 50:34.089
and us getting our house
repossessed on Christmas Eve. Ho, ho, ho.

50:35.157 --> 50:38.360
So you will forgive me
if l don't listen.

50:45.634 --> 50:46.968
I'm sorry.

50:49.638 --> 50:51.139
No, I'm sorry.

50:52.907 --> 50:56.610
A father's someone
you should be able to rely on, you know?

51:03.051 --> 51:04.919
Anyway, dinner.

51:06.954 --> 51:09.256
We have got
cabbages, a leek,

51:10.391 --> 51:12.025
three medium carrots.

51:12.092 --> 51:14.994
You're not one of those
vegetarians, are you?

51:15.062 --> 51:16.112
No.

51:16.530 --> 51:17.631
Good.

51:19.733 --> 51:21.701
Declan one,
chicken nil.

51:23.403 --> 51:24.570
Sweet.

51:30.611 --> 51:31.979
Coq au vim?

51:35.147 --> 51:36.248
What?

51:38.351 --> 51:39.985
Give me strength.

51:44.490 --> 51:48.493
Don't start telling me
that you've never had chicken stew before.

51:49.094 --> 51:50.728
Of course l have.

51:51.530 --> 51:55.267
I'm wondering where
it is that you think chickens come from.

51:57.702 --> 51:59.470
The freezer section.

52:02.407 --> 52:04.175
l know, l know. l...

52:05.976 --> 52:07.844
You just surprised me.

52:08.513 --> 52:10.281
You keep doing that.

52:15.854 --> 52:17.188
Give me the carrots.

52:17.254 --> 52:18.722
Yes, carrots.

52:24.127 --> 52:25.177
Sorry.

52:25.194 --> 52:27.729
We build up
the temperature a little bit.

52:28.431 --> 52:31.700
You don't need
to chop them. It's hard to hold.

52:31.769 --> 52:33.537
That smells amazing.

52:37.774 --> 52:39.108
Good girl. And...

53:02.531 --> 53:04.933
So this is what
you call staging, is it?

53:05.199 --> 53:06.433
Sort of.

53:08.269 --> 53:09.803
Not too shabby.

53:10.071 --> 53:11.472
Here?
Yeah.

53:26.821 --> 53:27.871
Impeccable.

53:29.790 --> 53:31.791
The chicken
was wonderful.

53:31.859 --> 53:34.428
Wasn't it?
And I'm usually awful at chicken.

53:34.494 --> 53:36.395
Jeremy always says
l make it too dry.

53:36.463 --> 53:37.664
Jeremy?

53:37.964 --> 53:39.014
Oh!

53:39.432 --> 53:41.367
Jeremy. Our...

53:41.995 --> 53:44.200
Our next door neighbor.

53:44.203 --> 53:46.638
Who sometimes
comes by for dinner.

53:46.706 --> 53:47.756
Right, Declan?

53:47.758 --> 53:49.306
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
He's a lovely old soul.

53:49.308 --> 53:50.409
Yeah.

53:50.411 --> 53:52.475
A little bit
learning difficulties, you know.

53:52.478 --> 53:55.180
Tells everyone
he's a cardiologist. It's a scream.

53:57.082 --> 53:59.083
But he's a happy chap,
you know.

53:59.150 --> 54:02.086
He's got a little thing,
bless him, for her.

54:04.389 --> 54:05.556
Antique, Frank?

54:05.624 --> 54:07.692
Antique, yeah. Like me.

54:09.762 --> 54:11.330
Wedding present,
they were.

54:11.396 --> 54:14.031
It's only 44 years,
you cheeky rascal!

54:30.280 --> 54:33.350
See?
That's what it takes to be married for 44 years.

54:33.417 --> 54:34.551
The kiss.

54:34.618 --> 54:39.122
Always kiss like
it's the first time and the last time.

54:59.508 --> 55:00.675
Grand.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.515
Well, come on then, son.

55:07.649 --> 55:09.984
Show us old ones
how it's done.

55:11.653 --> 55:12.754
Sorry?

55:12.821 --> 55:14.722
Well, I've kissed
my wife.

55:14.789 --> 55:17.558
Stefano has certainly
kissed his wife.

55:18.225 --> 55:21.227
No, we're fine.
We did it earlier, kiss.

55:21.496 --> 55:22.997
Done and dusted.

55:23.064 --> 55:26.233
A bit of chivalry, man.
You know what I'm saying?

55:30.004 --> 55:31.305
Oh! That's perfect.

55:31.371 --> 55:34.507
lf that was a kiss,
I'm surprised you're still wed to him at all.

55:34.575 --> 55:36.910
No, no,
they're shy, that's all.

55:37.143 --> 55:38.744
Yes. Really shy.

55:39.278 --> 55:41.046
You're among friends!

55:41.115 --> 55:44.251
You're young,
married, in love!

55:44.952 --> 55:46.720
Anyone can see that.

55:47.153 --> 55:48.654
Damn it, man.

55:49.589 --> 55:50.890
Kiss the girl!

56:18.884 --> 56:20.685
Brayo!
There you go.

56:20.752 --> 56:23.588
Now that's a kiss!

56:36.534 --> 56:38.068
It's quite wet.

56:40.604 --> 56:42.906
Show a little mercy,
would you?

56:45.508 --> 56:46.775
All right.

56:46.843 --> 56:49.045
But one snore
and you're back in the shower.

56:49.113 --> 56:50.280
Great.

57:04.226 --> 57:07.696
Who'd have thought
it'd take two days to get to Dublin?

57:08.164 --> 57:11.267
l have to charge you
an overnighter, by the way.

57:11.333 --> 57:12.500
Surprise.

57:12.601 --> 57:14.402
100.
Fifty.

57:15.303 --> 57:19.440
Seventy-five it is.
Running total 675.

57:23.078 --> 57:26.514
Fine.
If it's all about money for you, then 675 it is.

57:31.319 --> 57:32.687
Good night.

57:32.887 --> 57:34.054
Night.

59:21.324 --> 59:22.834
I'm so sorry
I'm not there yet.

59:22.891 --> 59:25.660
You can't imagine
what I've been through.

59:25.664 --> 59:28.893
Worse than when
they lost our luggage in Barbados?

59:28.897 --> 59:30.632
Like that times 10.

59:31.266 --> 59:33.701
l just... l just
can't wait to see you.

59:33.768 --> 59:36.270
Well, maybe this
will cheer you up.

59:36.637 --> 59:40.240
l just heard from the board,
and we got the apartment!

59:40.308 --> 59:41.358
What?
Yeah.

59:41.375 --> 59:44.044
l just got off the phone
with Edith. It's ours.

59:44.112 --> 59:45.913
Ah! Jeremy!

59:46.146 --> 59:48.748
That is exactly
what l needed to hear this morning.

59:48.816 --> 59:51.385
Everything
is working out for us. I'm so excited.

59:51.388 --> 59:53.717
We'll have to
celebrate in person when you get here.

59:53.721 --> 59:54.771
We sure will.

59:54.788 --> 59:56.289
Hurry up already.
I miss you.

59:56.357 --> 59:57.958
l miss you, too.

01:00:19.278 --> 01:00:20.512
Morning.

01:00:20.946 --> 01:00:22.013
Yeah.

01:00:22.148 --> 01:00:23.883
Oh, is this for me?

01:00:24.217 --> 01:00:25.318
Yeah.

01:00:26.184 --> 01:00:27.919
Morning, lovebirds!

01:00:28.787 --> 01:00:30.555
Sleep well, did you?

01:00:31.422 --> 01:00:32.472
Yes, thank you.

01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:38.929
So, what's on
the agenda today, then?

01:00:39.264 --> 01:00:41.332
Mmm. Off to Dublin
for me.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.535
Well, you can't
do that now.

01:00:43.801 --> 01:00:44.851
Why not?

01:00:44.869 --> 01:00:46.070
This is Sunday.

01:00:46.137 --> 01:00:49.940
Never start a journey
on a Sunday, or a full moon.

01:00:50.007 --> 01:00:52.943
Oh, well, l don't believe
in that superstition stuff.

01:00:53.010 --> 01:00:56.913
How are you
on train timetables? Do you believe in them?

01:00:59.049 --> 01:01:00.250
Sunday.

01:01:00.717 --> 01:01:02.518
No trains.

01:01:04.255 --> 01:01:05.789
No trains?
No.

01:01:06.424 --> 01:01:07.958
Oh! For God's sake.

01:01:10.093 --> 01:01:13.863
l have to be in Dublin
by the 29th. That's tomorrow.

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:16.832
Why is that
again, darling?

01:01:19.902 --> 01:01:21.570
Fine. Okay.

01:01:23.038 --> 01:01:25.440
Frank,
you have a car, don't you?

01:01:25.707 --> 01:01:27.108
Oh, yes.
Yes.

01:01:27.176 --> 01:01:28.777
Okay. l could...

01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:33.248
l would be willing to pay you
a substantial amount of money

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.450
if you would
maybe drive me.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.170
No.

01:01:40.222 --> 01:01:43.858
Oh! It's not
the money, girl. It's Eileen.

01:01:44.426 --> 01:01:46.528
She's got it.
Gone to Mass.

01:01:47.195 --> 01:01:49.363
Then the weekly shop,
you know.

01:01:49.366 --> 01:01:51.329
Okay, well, then
when she's back, you...

01:01:51.332 --> 01:01:53.767
She won't be back
till all hours.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:54.885
Why?

01:01:54.902 --> 01:01:56.472
It's a fair old jaunt
to Dublin.

01:02:00.841 --> 01:02:02.309
Where is she?

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:03.611
Dublin.

01:02:06.313 --> 01:02:07.480
Bingo!

01:02:24.431 --> 01:02:25.598
What?

01:02:28.234 --> 01:02:30.135
Bus station's
that way.

01:02:43.848 --> 01:02:44.949
What?

01:02:49.854 --> 01:02:51.322
Knock it off.

01:02:55.126 --> 01:02:56.727
It's hailstones.

01:02:59.162 --> 01:03:00.763
Are you serious?

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:02.131
Ow!
Run!

01:03:04.536 --> 01:03:07.472
Come on. It's fecking
Murphy's Law with you.

01:03:08.972 --> 01:03:10.239
Come on!

01:03:11.074 --> 01:03:12.375
l got Louis.
Don't worry.

01:03:12.442 --> 01:03:13.492
Ow!

01:03:13.977 --> 01:03:15.378
Those sting!

01:03:15.778 --> 01:03:17.679
The size
of golf balls!

01:03:17.813 --> 01:03:19.648
Jesus Christ!

01:03:22.985 --> 01:03:24.252
Is Lord.

01:03:25.755 --> 01:03:29.358
Have you any just cause
or impediment why this man and this woman

01:03:29.425 --> 01:03:32.528
should not be
joined together in holy matrimony?

01:03:33.695 --> 01:03:36.097
No, no, Father.
You carry on.

01:03:37.098 --> 01:03:39.800
I'm sure that they know
what they're doing.

01:03:40.702 --> 01:03:44.672
Good. In that case,
you're very welcome. Why don't you sit down?

01:03:49.344 --> 01:03:52.280
Come on.
Dublin. We should be making tracks.

01:03:52.284 --> 01:03:54.612
No.
The priest is gonna give us a ride

01:03:54.615 --> 01:03:56.148
to the bus station
when it's over.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:57.200
We can walk!

01:03:57.218 --> 01:04:00.421
I'm not walking
another four hours in these shoes.

01:04:00.654 --> 01:04:03.289
Besides, look
how beautiful it all is.

01:04:04.725 --> 01:04:06.593
l kind of
hate weddings.

01:04:07.895 --> 01:04:11.565
Why? Because people are in
love? That's so offensive to you?

01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:13.866
Yeah.

01:04:15.702 --> 01:04:16.969
You know,

01:04:17.304 --> 01:04:21.141
you have all of these
random opinions and a bad attitude.

01:04:21.145 --> 01:04:23.473
What do you know?
You're clearly not married,

01:04:23.476 --> 01:04:26.278
and you have obviously
never been engaged.

01:04:26.879 --> 01:04:28.513
Actually, l have.

01:04:28.881 --> 01:04:29.982
Once.

01:04:34.153 --> 01:04:38.290
l don't want to
interrupt a good party,

01:04:39.157 --> 01:04:41.993
but l want to say
thank you to my husband.

01:04:43.228 --> 01:04:48.232
l want to say,
may you never steal, lie or cheat.

01:04:49.201 --> 01:04:51.069
But if you must steal,

01:04:52.237 --> 01:04:54.339
then steal away
my sorrows.

01:04:55.641 --> 01:04:57.442
And if you must lie,

01:04:58.175 --> 01:05:00.844
lie with me
all the nights of my life.

01:05:01.779 --> 01:05:05.048
And if you must cheat,
then please cheat death,

01:05:06.683 --> 01:05:09.519
because l couldn't
live a day without you.

01:05:10.121 --> 01:05:11.322
Cheers!

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:32.641
Are you all right?

01:05:33.942 --> 01:05:36.678
Grand. You know,
it's just hot in there.

01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:41.183
Do you want
to talk about it?

01:05:43.552 --> 01:05:44.753
Listen,

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.787
Bob.

01:05:47.189 --> 01:05:49.257
You're not
in America now.

01:05:49.391 --> 01:05:52.393
You're in Ireland.
So, have a drink.

01:05:53.629 --> 01:05:54.896
Shut up.

01:05:56.397 --> 01:05:58.098
l was just
trying to help.

01:05:58.166 --> 01:05:59.567
Help?
Yeah.

01:06:00.001 --> 01:06:01.635
That's hilarious.

01:06:02.236 --> 01:06:05.726
The woman who's so desperate,
she's diddly-eying her way to Dublin,

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:07.905
making the most
important decision of her life

01:06:07.908 --> 01:06:10.577
based on some
ridiculous tradition,

01:06:10.581 --> 01:06:12.377
which, frankly,
is a load of old poo.

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:17.651
So, thank you,
but it's not l who needs the help, okay?

01:06:20.887 --> 01:06:24.056
It is not
a load of poo.

01:06:26.526 --> 01:06:28.027
It's romantic.

01:06:30.197 --> 01:06:32.399
It's really,
really romantic.

01:07:13.937 --> 01:07:15.938
I'm not good
at weddings.

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:19.773
They're better with
a couple martinis.

01:07:19.778 --> 01:07:21.479
Okay, thank you very much!

01:07:21.545 --> 01:07:25.282
We're going to do
a special request now for the bridesmaids.

01:07:25.582 --> 01:07:26.716
Want a go?

01:07:26.784 --> 01:07:29.553
No. No, l don't...
l don't Riverdance.

01:07:30.487 --> 01:07:33.189
Do you never let
your hair down, woman?

01:07:35.525 --> 01:07:36.592
Yes.

01:07:36.959 --> 01:07:38.593
In my way, l do.

01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:40.296
Good.

01:07:40.298 --> 01:07:44.529
Now, this is an easy one.
You'll pick it up. Just follow them.

01:07:44.534 --> 01:07:46.802
We're going in a circle
going that way.

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.488
No, no,
put me down!

01:09:05.777 --> 01:09:07.011
I'm really sorry.

01:09:07.078 --> 01:09:09.046
l was spinning.

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:14.685
Forget about it. At least
it wasn't my husband.

01:09:14.752 --> 01:09:16.988
Yeah. Right.
At least it wasn't him.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:23.560
I'm...

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.663
l thought
l was bad at weddings.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.657
Aren't you supposed to be
taking me to Dublin?

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:58.359
Well, just tell me when.
As ever, your servant awaits.

01:10:02.665 --> 01:10:05.267
You know what,
Declan?

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.137
Do you know
what you are?

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:10.105
Mmm-hmm.

01:10:10.171 --> 01:10:11.705
You're a beast.

01:10:13.041 --> 01:10:14.642
You're a real

01:10:17.078 --> 01:10:18.128
beast.

01:10:18.146 --> 01:10:19.196
Hmm.

01:10:19.247 --> 01:10:22.583
And l cannot
stand you.

01:10:23.216 --> 01:10:24.417
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

01:10:26.119 --> 01:10:27.787
But you know what?

01:10:29.056 --> 01:10:30.524
I'm onto you.

01:10:31.024 --> 01:10:32.074
Is that right?

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:35.127
All your beastishness
is like...

01:10:35.395 --> 01:10:36.929
It's an act.

01:10:38.665 --> 01:10:41.401
It's a great, big,
massive cover-up.

01:10:44.003 --> 01:10:48.707
And you growl
and you snap, but you are in...

01:10:54.013 --> 01:10:55.681
You're in pain.

01:10:56.882 --> 01:10:58.850
And you've got a...

01:11:02.187 --> 01:11:05.323
You've got a big thorn
in your beasty paw.

01:11:08.627 --> 01:11:10.028
Like a lion.

01:11:13.732 --> 01:11:15.700
A lovely, lovely lion.

01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:31.549
Great.
I'm sorry.

01:11:32.349 --> 01:11:33.950
That's romantic.

01:11:35.185 --> 01:11:36.886
Up you come. Up!

01:11:40.858 --> 01:11:42.593
God, you're a lump.

01:11:42.893 --> 01:11:43.943
My suitcase!

01:11:43.961 --> 01:11:46.263
Don't worry about Louis.
I'll get him.

01:13:15.881 --> 01:13:17.515
You're joking me.

01:13:29.694 --> 01:13:30.928
Perfect.

01:13:57.888 --> 01:14:00.724
You can
deduct the coffee from my bill.

01:14:04.593 --> 01:14:08.530
Deduct away.
Don't forget to add on for a new pair of shoes,

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.567
Pukey.

01:14:13.102 --> 01:14:15.804
Put them in the wash,
they'll be grand.

01:14:19.909 --> 01:14:21.744
You missed your bus.

01:14:23.211 --> 01:14:25.446
There's another one
in 20 minutes.

01:14:25.613 --> 01:14:27.648
Oh, God. Am l still
coming with you?

01:14:27.651 --> 01:14:29.347
l am paying you
to take me to Dublin

01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:31.952
and you're taking me
to Dublin.

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:05.751
That's fine.
Thank you.

01:15:13.359 --> 01:15:14.626
He's out.

01:15:15.828 --> 01:15:18.430
l left a message
with the front desk.

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:23.635
So, Dublin.

01:15:23.735 --> 01:15:25.236
Right on time.

01:15:26.905 --> 01:15:28.973
So l suppose
l should pay you.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.875
l suppose you should.

01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:32.576
There'll be an at the hotel.

01:15:32.579 --> 01:15:34.309
Right, so I'll be
portering again, will l?

01:15:34.311 --> 01:15:35.812
Not if you don't
want to.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.414
l didn't say that.

01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:38.531
We can get a cab.

01:15:38.549 --> 01:15:40.484
You've got legs,
haven't you, woman?

01:15:40.551 --> 01:15:42.586
My best feature,
so I'm told.

01:15:44.089 --> 01:15:45.757
Who told you that?

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:51.728
It's a beautiful city.

01:15:52.328 --> 01:15:54.963
And l haven't seen
one backstabbing snake.

01:15:55.833 --> 01:15:59.383
Yeah, well, it's the chancers
and cheats that you have to watch out for.

01:16:12.715 --> 01:16:14.583
She's here,
isn't she?

01:16:16.753 --> 01:16:19.589
In Dublin.
One of the chancers and cheats.

01:16:20.555 --> 01:16:22.523
The blonde in the photo.

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.761
Who was the guy?

01:16:29.931 --> 01:16:30.998
Oh!

01:16:31.967 --> 01:16:33.501
So him and her...

01:16:34.603 --> 01:16:35.770
Right.

01:16:36.772 --> 01:16:37.939
Sorry.

01:16:39.607 --> 01:16:43.677
We were all running
the Caragh together, me, Kaleigh, Ryan.

01:16:45.646 --> 01:16:49.182
So we bought the pub
and built it up from nothing.

01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:54.054
We really got it going.
l mean, we were flying.

01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:58.291
And l thought
that me and Kaleigh were mad for each other.

01:17:00.995 --> 01:17:02.529
Apparently not.

01:17:07.167 --> 01:17:10.336
So that thing I'd grab
if l had 60 seconds,

01:17:12.072 --> 01:17:14.407
it's my mother's
Claddagh ring.

01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:18.906
You know, the ones
with the two hands holding the crowned heart.

01:17:18.912 --> 01:17:20.179
Mmm-hmm.

01:17:20.679 --> 01:17:22.147
Well, she's got it.

01:17:24.184 --> 01:17:27.287
Well, you're here now.
You should find her and get it back.

01:17:27.786 --> 01:17:29.254
l don't know.

01:17:29.822 --> 01:17:31.790
It's your mother's ring.

01:17:31.793 --> 01:17:33.389
Anyway, l thought
it was your ring

01:17:33.391 --> 01:17:35.593
we were meant to be
worrying about.

01:17:35.828 --> 01:17:37.029
Diddly-eye.

01:17:37.096 --> 01:17:38.697
Oh, yeah. Right.

01:17:40.431 --> 01:17:43.534
Well, I'm glad to see
you're finally on board.

01:17:44.303 --> 01:17:48.240
It has nothing to do with me.
I'm just the old bag carrier around here.

01:17:48.306 --> 01:17:49.974
Why should l care?

01:17:51.209 --> 01:17:52.677
So you don't?

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:56.147
Would it make
a difference?

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:03.520
Come on.

01:18:29.345 --> 01:18:30.395
So.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.130
So.

01:18:38.787 --> 01:18:40.722
Here.
Nah, it's okay.

01:18:41.589 --> 01:18:44.425
Declan, take it.
We had a deal. Please?

01:18:45.093 --> 01:18:49.864
Tell you what. Why don't you just give
me that one bob and we'll call it a day?

01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:51.432
Which one bob?

01:18:52.834 --> 01:18:55.136
The one we flipped
for the bed.

01:18:57.205 --> 01:18:58.372
Yeah.

01:19:01.842 --> 01:19:02.943
Liar.

01:19:08.348 --> 01:19:10.249
Well, best of luck.
Yeah.

01:19:12.986 --> 01:19:14.520
So long, Louis.

01:19:35.507 --> 01:19:36.741
Anna.

01:19:37.076 --> 01:19:38.143
Yes?

01:19:38.844 --> 01:19:40.946
Anna! Anna!

01:19:42.047 --> 01:19:43.448
Hi! Finally. God.

01:19:43.451 --> 01:19:46.948
l thought l was gonna have to
call a helicopter rescue team to come get you.

01:19:46.952 --> 01:19:48.486
Where have you been? Hi.
Hey.

01:19:48.552 --> 01:19:50.453
Long story.
Sorry.

01:19:51.022 --> 01:19:52.823
It's good
to see you.

01:19:52.891 --> 01:19:54.892
You okay? Yeah?
Mmm. Yeah.

01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.010
Hi.

01:19:57.895 --> 01:19:59.896
I'm sorry,
do l know you?

01:19:59.964 --> 01:20:01.098
Oh!

01:20:01.165 --> 01:20:04.301
Jeremy, this is Declan.
Declan drove...

01:20:04.668 --> 01:20:07.303
He helped me get
from Dingle to Dublin.

01:20:07.371 --> 01:20:10.507
Oh! Okay. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Yeah, well, l don't envy that job.

01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:13.175
This lady is not
big on adventure.

01:20:14.711 --> 01:20:15.761
No.

01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:17.981
Nice to meet you, bro.

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.681
Nice to meet you.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:20.617 --> 01:20:22.618
So did she
take care of you?

01:20:25.555 --> 01:20:27.156
Did you tip him?

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:28.991
Oh!

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:31.793
She paid me.

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:34.929
Great. Well, thanks for
getting her home safe.

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:38.200
Oh, God, l missed you!
l missed you! l missed you! l missed you!

01:20:38.268 --> 01:20:39.936
l missed you, too.

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.003
No, l really
missed you.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:43.872
l did. And...

01:20:44.606 --> 01:20:46.507
And it got me thinking.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:49.644
Why aren't we married?

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:57.919
Will you marry me?

01:20:58.819 --> 01:21:00.320
Are you serious?

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:03.658
Am l serious? Yeah.
Well, I'm down on my knee. l...

01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:06.827
l got this.

01:21:15.236 --> 01:21:17.771
No pressure,
but it's all on camera.

01:21:25.745 --> 01:21:27.646
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart.

01:21:28.614 --> 01:21:29.848
Sweetie?

01:21:30.716 --> 01:21:33.518
l... Were you supposed
to give me an answer?

01:21:35.388 --> 01:21:37.757
Yes. Of course.

01:21:37.823 --> 01:21:39.357
Yeah?
Yes.

01:21:42.227 --> 01:21:43.895
Okay.
Let's try this on.

01:21:46.398 --> 01:21:47.632
Ah! It fits!

01:21:48.471 --> 01:21:52.199
l have champagne
waiting in the room,

01:21:52.204 --> 01:21:53.805
so we should go on up.
Great.

01:21:53.871 --> 01:21:55.772
Thank you.

01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:44.085
l never thought
I'd see you in Dublin.

01:22:49.659 --> 01:22:50.893
Declan.

01:22:52.528 --> 01:22:53.762
Kaleigh.

01:23:07.542 --> 01:23:11.012
There you go.
And there's pints. They're on the way.

01:23:11.078 --> 01:23:12.913
Thank you!
You are saving the pub.

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:15.990
You're keeping
the pans in the kitchen. l will kiss you later.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:17.851
Congratulations! Hi!

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.787
Let me see it!

01:23:21.021 --> 01:23:22.088
Wow.

01:23:22.322 --> 01:23:23.372
Mmm.

01:23:30.029 --> 01:23:31.196
Dekko.

01:23:31.298 --> 01:23:33.033
Tom. There you are.

01:23:34.368 --> 01:23:35.418
You're short.

01:23:35.436 --> 01:23:36.670
But not by much.

01:23:36.836 --> 01:23:38.938
Sorry. Come on, lads!

01:23:39.005 --> 01:23:41.474
Oh, my God,
look at this place!

01:23:41.774 --> 01:23:43.575
Do you like it?
Do l like it?

01:23:43.643 --> 01:23:46.712
l want to throw you
out of your own window and take it.

01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:48.847
Hold on a minute there.

01:23:52.719 --> 01:23:56.389
You can show us the color
of your wallet for a change.

01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:05.997
That's all.

01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:10.267
Drinks on the house!

01:24:12.628 --> 01:24:15.737
l feel like your
whole happy ending

01:24:15.741 --> 01:24:18.076
is gonna be a real test
for our friendship.

01:24:18.079 --> 01:24:19.308
I'm pretty sure
she would have been happy

01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:21.476
with just this apartment.
l don't think you needed to propose.

01:24:21.479 --> 01:24:23.414
Oh! It was kind of
a package deal.

01:24:23.481 --> 01:24:26.283
Really?
What, buy an apartment, they throw in a ring?

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:28.652
More like
the other way around.

01:24:29.253 --> 01:24:30.587
What do you mean?

01:24:30.589 --> 01:24:32.386
Well, l think it was
Edith, from the board.

01:24:32.389 --> 01:24:35.339
She called me in Dublin,
probing about our marital status.

01:24:35.391 --> 01:24:40.395
Can you believe that?
Nothing specific, just interested, you know?

01:24:40.401 --> 01:24:43.095
Like the residents,
they're kind of old-fashioned

01:24:43.099 --> 01:24:45.835
when it comes to
issues like this. Blah, blah, blah.

01:24:45.901 --> 01:24:50.138
l got the message.
Married, you're in. Unmarried, you're not.

01:24:50.507 --> 01:24:54.010
So l just said
we were hours away from getting engaged.

01:24:54.143 --> 01:24:55.711
l just said it
and it came out.

01:24:55.779 --> 01:24:57.614
And l don't know
where it came from,

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.749
but l could
almost hear them cutting our keys.

01:25:00.883 --> 01:25:03.518
So l put down the phone
and thought, "Well,

01:25:04.952 --> 01:25:06.887
"why the hell not,
you know?"

01:25:06.954 --> 01:25:08.355
Really?
Sure. l mean,

01:25:08.358 --> 01:25:10.089
we'd have gotten around
to it eventually, right?

01:25:10.091 --> 01:25:11.992
Right. Of course.
Yeah.

01:25:15.163 --> 01:25:16.213
Yeah.

01:25:16.215 --> 01:25:17.862
Oh, Libby, l want
to show you this view.

01:25:17.865 --> 01:25:19.233
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:25:19.834 --> 01:25:21.635
It's gorgeous.
Okay.

01:26:06.645 --> 01:26:08.947
Is that the fire alarm?
Really?

01:26:09.715 --> 01:26:13.618
Okay, everybody,
l guess we'd better take this party downstairs.

01:26:20.124 --> 01:26:21.625
The phones.

01:26:25.896 --> 01:26:28.398
Where is the remote
for this thing?

01:26:29.099 --> 01:26:31.835
These things are useless
without the remote. Anna!

01:26:31.839 --> 01:26:33.268
Do you have
everything you need?

01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:35.202
Can you just look
around for valuables?

01:26:35.205 --> 01:26:37.307
For laptops,
cameras, whatever.

01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:42.073
l think the cameras...
Okay, here's the video camera.

01:26:42.078 --> 01:26:44.010
l still haven't
put the proposal up on Facebook,

01:26:44.013 --> 01:26:45.781
so let me get that.

01:26:47.584 --> 01:26:49.919
Oh, sweetie,
can you get the...

01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:51.520
Anna?

01:26:53.322 --> 01:26:54.423
Anna?

01:27:12.465 --> 01:27:16.640
We have one
minestrone soup, two quiche,

01:27:16.645 --> 01:27:19.681
one pie beef,
one pie chicken, one green salad. Go, go, go.

01:27:20.849 --> 01:27:22.050
Dekko?
Uh-huh!

01:27:22.116 --> 01:27:23.984
A customer said
the chicken's dry.

01:27:24.051 --> 01:27:25.101
The what's what?

01:27:25.119 --> 01:27:26.653
The chicken.
It's dry.

01:27:26.987 --> 01:27:28.421
It's a pie.

01:27:35.729 --> 01:27:37.163
It's delicious.

01:27:37.231 --> 01:27:40.334
Alex, you're in charge.
Don't blow anything up.

01:27:47.273 --> 01:27:50.643
All right, which one of you
bollockses thinks my chicken's dry?

01:27:51.845 --> 01:27:52.912
You?

01:27:53.279 --> 01:27:54.346
You?

01:27:54.614 --> 01:27:55.664
Me.

01:28:10.062 --> 01:28:12.464
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:28:12.467 --> 01:28:14.797
Could you maybe be nice
for just a second?

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.335
l did fly
3, miles to get here.

01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:20.271
Is Jeremy with you?

01:28:20.339 --> 01:28:22.541
What? No! No.

01:28:29.781 --> 01:28:32.817
Jeremy and l...
It didn't work out.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:36.887
Sorry.

01:28:38.823 --> 01:28:39.990
J
Well

01:28:41.124 --> 01:28:44.293
when my 60 seconds
came around, l realized

01:28:45.395 --> 01:28:47.930
l had everything
l ever wanted

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:50.333
but nothing
l really needed.

01:28:50.968 --> 01:28:54.471
And l think that
what l need is here.

01:28:56.339 --> 01:28:59.909
And l came all this way
to see if maybe you might think so, too.

01:28:59.976 --> 01:29:01.210
And if you do...

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:09.217
Well, l don't really
have any plans past that, which is new for me.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:12.821
So,

01:29:14.323 --> 01:29:16.258
Declan O'Callaghan,

01:29:16.592 --> 01:29:19.494
and l should probably
learn your middle name,

01:29:20.963 --> 01:29:22.864
here is my proposal.

01:29:25.768 --> 01:29:27.903
l propose
we not make plans.

01:29:29.237 --> 01:29:31.305
l propose we give
this thing a chance

01:29:31.372 --> 01:29:33.807
and let it work out
how it works out.

01:29:34.709 --> 01:29:36.310
So what do you say?

01:29:38.413 --> 01:29:41.048
Do you want to
not make plans with me?

01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:27.092
l guess
that's an Irish no.

01:31:24.546 --> 01:31:26.414
Mrs. O'Bradycallaghan.

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:32.487
Where the hell
are you going?

01:31:39.127 --> 01:31:40.528
You said no.

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:42.764
l didn't say no.

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:45.933
l didn't say anything.

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:48.636
You walked away.

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.671
l was getting something.

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:54.541
Really? That was
a good time to go get something?

01:31:54.608 --> 01:31:56.509
Well, yeah,
it was, actually.

01:31:58.511 --> 01:32:00.246
l was getting this.

01:32:03.783 --> 01:32:05.284
You big idiot.

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:10.157
l wouldn't be
holding this ring if it weren't for you.

01:32:10.924 --> 01:32:12.825
l reject your proposal.

01:32:15.428 --> 01:32:18.264
l don't want to
not make plans with you.

01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:22.935
l want to make
plans with you.

01:32:24.736 --> 01:32:25.937
You do?

01:32:26.838 --> 01:32:28.773
Yeah. l do.

01:32:37.548 --> 01:32:39.216
Will you marry me?

01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:46.058
In all my life,
l never thought I'd see you down on one knee.

01:32:47.125 --> 01:32:49.827
Yeah, it's getting
a bit damp down here, so...

01:32:51.562 --> 01:32:54.798
What's it to be,
Anna from Boston?

01:32:57.168 --> 01:32:58.235
Yes.

01:32:59.269 --> 01:33:00.670
Yes, l will.

01:33:30.723 --> 01:33:33.999
I'm so relieved.
For a minute there,

01:33:34.003 --> 01:33:36.739
l thought l wasn't
gonna have a place to stay tonight.

01:33:36.805 --> 01:33:37.906
What?

01:33:38.807 --> 01:33:41.209
You think
you're staying with me?

01:33:41.743 --> 01:33:43.511
This might cost you.

01:33:44.679 --> 01:33:46.547
Put it on my bill.

01:33:52.487 --> 01:33:54.188
Would you
Look at that!

01:33:54.255 --> 01:33:58.859
On a Sunday, no less.
It's good luck to get engaged on a Sunday.

01:34:00.962 --> 01:34:02.630
And end a journey.

01:34:03.031 --> 01:34:04.799
Aye, and dig a well.

01:34:04.931 --> 01:34:08.134
Idiot! Do they look like
they're digging a well?

01:34:08.138 --> 01:34:10.867
You know what
I'm talking about.

01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:13.740
l never know
what you're talking about.

01:34:28.487 --> 01:34:30.622
Are you sure
she's gonna make it?

01:34:31.190 --> 01:34:33.292
Remember,
she's a classic.

01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.340
And she's good as new,

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:38.362
even after
some crazy woman tried to push her off the road.

01:34:38.366 --> 01:34:39.762
l didn't try to
push her off the road!

01:34:39.764 --> 01:34:41.599
l was scraping
cow poo off my shoe

01:34:41.666 --> 01:34:44.435
'cause some rude man
wouldn't help me with the cows.

01:34:44.703 --> 01:34:48.173
Only because someone
was being pigheaded and couldn't wait.

01:34:49.407 --> 01:34:50.608
Shut up.

01:34:51.776 --> 01:34:53.377
There you are.

01:34:54.511 --> 01:34:55.678
Right.

01:34:56.348 --> 01:34:57.682
Where to?

01:35:00.651 --> 01:35:02.019
Just drive.

01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.221
You got it, Bob.

01:35:06.748 --> 01:35:10.223
Wait a minute.
Where's Louis?

01:35:10.227 --> 01:35:12.425
Louis? He's fine.
Strapped him to the roof.

01:35:12.428 --> 01:35:15.061
You strapped him
to the roof? He'll get filthy up there.

01:35:15.065 --> 01:35:16.232
Don't worry.

01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.902
We'll throw him
in the wash. He'll be grand.
